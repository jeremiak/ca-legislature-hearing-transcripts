THE FOLLOWING- AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE- EXCUSE ME EMAIL ADDRESS. BUDGET SUB THREE AT ASM DOT CA DOT GOV ALL SPELLED OUT ITS BUDGET B. U. D. G. E. T. SUB S. U. B. THREE NUMERAL THREE. AT A. S. M. DOT C. A. DOT GOV. PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY. WRITTEN THAT TESTIMONY SENT TO THAT EMAIL ADDRESS WILL BE CONSIDERED PUBLIC COMMENT AND MAY BE READ INTO THE RECORD YOU WANT TO. WELCOME CHAIR BUDGET YOUR TANK IS JUST ARRIVED AND TO ASK IF ANY OF WOULD LIKE TO ADD COMMENTS AFTER I COMPLETE MY FORMAL COMMENTS THE- I THINK YOU ALL KNOW ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO- ARE HERE ON THE DIETS THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF WILDFIRES THAT. CAN BE DISCUSSED THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED BUT TODAY'S HEARING HAS A VERY LIMITED- BUT IMPORTANT FOCUS ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION. AND THE SPECIFICALLY THE NEED TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENTS IN FIRE PREVENTION AND THE NEED TO BE MORE STRATEGIC AND REGIONAL IN OUR APPROACH TO PREVENTION. NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS AND PRESCRIBED BURNING AND- WELL THESE PROJECTS ARE SUITABLE FOR AREAS WITH EXCESSIVE. FUEL LOADS OR AREAS WITH FIRED. THE PROJECTS MIGHT NOT BE A PRO FOR AREAS LIKE THE CHAPARRAL- WHICH IS COMMON- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE MEMBERS MANY- OF OUR SIR FROM TODAY WE WILL BE TAKING A DEEPER DIVE INTO THE COMPLEXITY AND REGION ALLEY OVER FIRE RISK AND THE NEED FOR A MORE TAILORED TO MORE NUANCED APPROACH. WE WILL LOOK AT FACTORS SUCH AS WIND CONDITIONS VEGETATION TYPE AND THE INFLUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON WILDFIRE RISK. THIS YEAR UNFORTUNATELY WE YET AGAIN BROKE ANOTHER WILDFIRE RECORD AND ON OCTOBER FOURTH WE SURPASSED FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNED THAT MORE THAN DOUBLED OUR LAST RECORD WHICH WAS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRES. OF THAT. BURNED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONLY TO SHORE YEARS AGO. IT IS BECAUSE- THAT THE STATE THE ENTIRE STATE IS AT GRAVE FIRE RISK AND THIS RISK WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE UNLESS WE COME UP WITH A STRATEGY TO MITIGATE IT. THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ALLOCATED A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND. THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIRE. AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT- THIS FIGURE IS IN STARK CONTRAST WITH THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS- FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION AND RESPONSE AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULD INVOICE INVEST. LESS IN FIRE SUPPRESSION THERE ARE PLENTY OF ARGUMENTS WE COULD MAKE TO INCREASE OFTEN FOR FIRST. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO PROPERLY AND ADEQUATELY FUND FIRE PREVENTION AND FIRE RISK REDUCTION MEASURES- IN THE- HOPE THAT WE CAN PROTECT PROPERTY AND THAT WE CAN PREVENT FIRES FROM STARTING- AND SPREADING. IN THE FIRST PLACE SO IT'S TIME TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT TO HOW WE CURRENTLY INVEST IN FIRE PREVENTION THE GAPS THAT EXIST IN FUNDING AND WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE FIRE PREVENTION RISK REDUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S ALSO TIME THAT WE TREAT OUR WILDFIRE RISK LIKE THE THREAT IT IS I DON'T WANT TO. COME BACK I DON'T WANT THIS CONVERSATION TO FADE WITH THE FIRE SEASON ONLY FOR US TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND HAVE THE SAME CONVERSATION ALL OVER AGAIN I HOPE THAT WE CAN KEEP THIS ISSUE HIGH ON OUR LIST OF PRIORITIES. AND CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS SOLUTIONS NOT ALL FRANKLY OF WHICH ARE APPARENT. COME WITH I LIKE TO ASK IF. ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE SAY A FEW WORDS BEFORE WE BEGIN. THREE OF US AND LET ME ARE WELCOME- YOU MISS FRIEDMAN- YOU'RE HERE FOR- AS THE CHAIR OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES- COMMITTEE AND- I KNOW THAT THESE ISSUES ARE OF INTENSE INTEREST YOU. YEAH AND I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING HEARING AND ESPECIALLY THE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL ANNOUNCED THAT NATURAL RESOURCES IS GOING TO BE HAVING HEARINGS ON FIRE PREVENTION. INCLUDING ONE ON NOVEMBER NINTH AT ONE PM. WHICH IS GOT THE CATCHY TITLE EXPANDING THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE INCLUDING CULTURAL BURNING TO REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE RISK SO SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO ANYBODY WHO'S TAKING THE TIME TO WATCH THIS TODAY. AND CERTAINLY EN ROUTE YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- WHICH LEAD TO CLIMATE. CHANGE GLOBAL WARMING WHICH ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR FIRE ISSUES I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT OUR STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALSO HAVE TO EMBRACE FIRE PREVENTION STRATEGIES THAT ARE MEANINGFUL. AND MAKE MUCH LARGER INVESTMENTS TO MAKE OUR BUILT AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT MORE RESILIENT TO WILDFIRE USING THE BEST- AND DEVELOPING SCIENCE. ONLY THIS WILL REDUCE BOTH THE ERROR IMPACT QUALITY IMPACTS AND THE DEVASTATION THAT THESE WILDFIRES HAVE BEEN CAUSING ACROSS OUR STATE. IF THE STATE AND FEDERAL. HAD SPENT AT LEAST AS MUCH ON FIRE PREVENTION AS THEY HAVE ON FIRE SUPPRESSION OVER THE YEARS I THINK THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT WE WOULDN'T BE IN. NEARLY AS DIRE SITUATION AS WE ARE TODAY SO I HOPE THAT. WE CAN HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I'M GOING INTO THE FUTURE AND AGAIN THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY. YOU'RE WELCOME ANYONE ELSE. THE DRESS WELCOME TO HAVE A GREAT TO A CONTINGENT OF PEOPLE THERE- TODAY- AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT- THIS HEARING IS DISTANT FROM MOST OF THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE- I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE PRIORITY THAT- THAT THIS ISSUE HAS. BEEN ADDRESSED SENATE-ROOM MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING I WANT TO THANK YOU AND TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR PUTTING ON THIS TIMELY AND IMPORTANT HERE IN. THE AST FEW MONTHS HAVE CLEARLY SHOWN THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS MAKING OUR WILDFIRES MORE CATASTROPHIC AND LESS MANAGEABLE THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. CLEARLY WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US. COMING FROM A COMMUNITY THAT ALREADY STRUGGLES WITH POOR AIR QUALITY THE INCREASED POLLUTION FROM WILDFIRES IS INCREDIBLY CONCERNING TO MAKE. WE BREATHE SOME OF THE WORST AIR IN THE COUNTRY AND I FEAR THAT IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE IN THE COMING YEARS. WE NEED SERIOUS INVESTMENTS AND POLICY CHANGES AND OUR FIRE PREVENTION. AND SUPPRESSION EFFORTS TO AVOID THESE ESCALATIONS. AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE OUR FIRE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS MORE EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE. DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO BEST MANAGE OUR RESOURCES A PREVENT WILDFIRES FROM ESCALATING IN THE FIRST PLACE NEED TO GO HAND IN HAND. WITH OUT WITH HOW DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE INCORPORATE A DIVERSE FIREFIGHTING FORCE WITH EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AT THE FOREFRONT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR PANELISTS ON HOW TO BEST ADDRESS AND IMPLEMENT THE STATE'S WILDFIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. MISTER MOLOT IT FROM JUST A BRIEF NOTE OF THANKS MISTER CHAIR FOR- HAVING THIS INTERIM HEARING I SEE A NUMBER OF- MEMBERS OF OUR CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND WORKING GROUP ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T COME TOGETHER IN TWENTY TWENTY I THINK THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF- THE GOVERNOR'S- COMMITMENT TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING MAJOR WITH REGARD TO WILDFIRE OF MEDICATION AND- IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING I SUPPOSE THAT THESE CLIMATE ISSUES- WILL CONTINUE TO BE PREVALENT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SOME- ROBUST DISCUSSIONS AND IN THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF- IN PREPARATION FOR THAT- THE BALLOT BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING BREDESON HEARING FORWARD TODAY MISTER CHAIR AND I KNOW THAT WILDFIRE MITIGATION THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR COMPONENT OF ANYTHING- HOW WE DO ON THAT FRONT SO- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR- REMINDING ME ABOUT- OUR EFFORTS- AT THE END OF SESSION AROUND TO TRYING TO PULL TOGETHER A QUOTE ACTUALLY WAS THE A LITTLE- MORE THAN JUST THE END OF SESSION WHERE WE TRY TO- PULL TOGETHER- AND EFFORTS TO FUND SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND IT WAS THAT EFFORT AND THEN AFFIRMATIVE EFFORT AT THE VERY END OF SESSION THAT- ENDED UP TO AND NOT GOING ANYWHERE THAT- I THINK REALLY WAS THE PRECURSOR TO HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY AND SO WE'RE STARTING EARLY. AND I AM HOPING THAT THIS DOES- RESULT AND- A PRODUCTIVE STEPS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. TAKE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO ARE FOR PANELIST IS BRIAN BROWN WHO YOU ALL OF THE LAW. ANALYST'S OFFICE HE'S GOING TO HELP SET THE STAGE FOR TODAY'S HEARING BY WALKING US THROUGH- THE FUNDING THAT WE PHùHAD OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. BRIAN GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BRIAN BROWN WITH THE L. A. M. YOUR STAFF IS ASKED IF I. VICE TO VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF FOR THE HEARING FOCUSED AS THE CHAIR SAID ON THE STATE'S FISCAL- AUGMENTATIONS IN FUNDING FOR A PRETTY GOOD FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION AS WELL AS IN COMPARISON TO FIR RESPOND SPENDING- I DO HAVE A HANDOUT THAT. HOPEFULLY YOU WILL HAVE COPIES OF IT DISTRIBUTED TO COMMITTEE STAFF I WILL NOTE FOR THE AUDIENCE- THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS WELL IT IS ON THE L. A. L. WEBSITE AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE AS WELL IF. TURN OF THE FIRST PAGE OF THAT HAND OUT- THIS IS REALLY JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR THE SEVERITY OF THE WILDFIRE PROBLEM IN RECENT YEARS. AND WHAT YOU SEE ON THIS MAP IS THE TWENTY SIX FIRES THAT HAVE- BEEN EITHER AMONG THE TOP TWENTY LARGEST OR THE TOP TWENTY. MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES SINCE CALIFORNIA'S BEEN TRACKING THIS DATA FROM THE TWENTY TO THIRTY SOMETHING IT NEARLY A CENTURY. AND WHAT I THINK REALLY TWO IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS HERE IS JUST HOW MANY HAVE BEEN IN THE MOST RECENT YEARS IT REALLY. SIGNALS EIGHTY MORE OF A TREND. TOWARD THESE LARGE DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN RECENT YEARS. AND THEN ALSO I POINT OUT DE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF WHERE THE FIRES OF LOW BEEN LOCATED. SO YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE MANY OF THESE LARGE DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTRAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BOTH IN LAND IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. AS WELL AS IN THE COASTAL RANGES. IF YOU TURN TO THE PAGE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE. CONTENT BEFORE-I GET INTO THE FISCAL STORY- ON IT AND THIS IS JUST EIGHTY AN ILLUSTRATION TO KIND OF GIVE FOLKS A SENSE OF WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WILDFIRE RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE OR- LOCAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'LL TALK ABOUT A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES FOR PREVENTION MITIGATION THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING OF COURSE AS WELL AS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. AND EVEN WITHIN THE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION CATEGORY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES. THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN- PROVIDE A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC EXAMPLES SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE. FUNDED STATE GRANTS FOR FOREST HEALTH- AS WELL AS FOR FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES WE HAVE DEDICATED STAFF ESTATE STAFF. THAT DO PRESCRIBED FIRES- DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS AND WE ALSO HAVE A STATE CALIFORNIA STAFF TO HELP REVIEW. WELFARE MEDICATION PLANS FROM THE UTILITY THIS IS A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES. SO IF YOU TURN THREE. WHEN WE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA SPENDING INCREASED OVER RECENT YEARS WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN THIS GRAPHIC IS THE BOOK OF CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET SO THEIR FIRE PROTECTION AND SUPPRESSION OF FUNDING AS WELL AS A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING- D. THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRETY OF CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET BUT THE THIS IS THE VAST MAJORITY WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS TOTAL SPENDING ON THESE PROGRAMS AND INCREASED FROM ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE SIX. CAN ESTIMATE OF THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THERE COUPLE OF UNDERLYING TRENDS THERE SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE BASED FIRE PROTECTION BUDGET SO THIS IS THE CORE OF THE DEPARTMENT'S FIREFIGHTER- STAFF MANAGEMENT AND OTHER EQUIPMENT INTO FACILITIES- THAT HAS GROWN. STEADILY OVER THAT TIME PERIOD. IF YOU LOOK AT THE EMERGENCY SUPPRESSION SPENDING SO THIS IS WHAT WE THINK OF IT THE ECONOMY MERGING SEA FIND AS WELL AS WHATEVER REIMBURSEMENT THE ULTIMATELY RECEIVE FROM THE FEDERAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IF YOU WORK WITH. YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS VARIES QUITE A BIT FROM YEAR TO YEAR- CLEARLY IT IN RESPONSE TO THE SEVERITY OF THAT YEAR'S FIRE SEASON. AND I THINK CRITICALLY NOTABLE- YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT LAST WEEK THE ADMINISTRATION RELEASED THEIR REQUIRED QUARTERLY REPORT FIRST QUARTER REPORT. ON THE E. FIND WHICH ESTIMATED THAT THE- THE STATE WOULD BE SPENDING ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FROM EACH FIND. IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THAT WOULD BE AN ALL TIME RECORD FOR THAT. LASTLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP SHADED AREA. OF THE STATE THAT'S- STATE SPENDING ON RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. WELL YOU'LL SEE THERE'S A CORD TO THINK REALLY ONE THE IT MAKES IT A MUCH SMALLER SHARE OF TOTAL SPENDING AND IN THE DEPARTMENT RELATIVE TO FIRE SUPPRESSION COSTS- BUT I WILL NOTE THAT IF. YOU'LL SEE AN- INCREASE IN- THAT SPENDING IN MORE RECENT YEARS AND THAT REALLY REFLECTS. THE ADDITION OF GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION FUNDS. FOR THESE PROGRAMS LIKE FORCE MANAGEMENT AND PRESCRIBED FIRES- AND THAT WAS IN IN- CONSISTENT WITH SB NINE OH ONE PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. ALL JUST KNOW YOU'LL YOU'LL PROBABLY ALSO SEE THERE THAT FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE SPENDING IN FOREST- IN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FIRE PREVENTION DID DECREASE AGAIN THIS LARGELY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE- STATE BUDGET DID NOT INCLUDE A DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURE PLAN. FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND REFLECTING- QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW MUCH REVENUE WILL BE GENERATED. BUT WITH AN EXPECTATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY COME BACK AND- PAST EXPENDITURE. PLAN SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. IF YOU TURNED UP. FOR STEADFAST I PROVIDE US SOME OF WHAT OF THE KEY AUGMENT HAVE BEEN IN RECENT YEARS A LOT THREE YEARS FOR CALIFORNIA BOTH FOR FIRE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST MANAGEMENT. I WILL GO THROUGH EACH OF THESE OF COURSE AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BUT IF A FEW THINGS NO ONE YOU WILL SEEN- SEVERAL AUGMENTATION IN BOTH THOSE CATEGORIES OF SPENDING A FEW MORE UNDER FIRE RESPONSE AND UNDER PREVENTION OF FOREST MANAGEMENT. YOU SEE FEW LARGE. AUGMENTATIONS IN BOTH CATEGORIES SO FOR EXAMPLE UNDER FIRE RESPONSE. YOU SEE THE FIRST LINE THERE THE- REPLACEMENT OF THE STATE'S HELICOPTER FLEET. AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS A ONE TIME COST. YOU ALSO SEE MORE RECENTLY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR- AND AUGMENTATION FOR RELIEF STAFFING SERVICE FOR ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IN THE DEPARTMENT. EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. UNDER FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST MANAGEMENT AYE AYE NOTED ALREADY SB EIGHT NINE OH ONE REQUIRED TO ANNUALLY ON A FIVE YEAR BASIS. THE THAT GIGI R. F. WOULD FUND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOREST HEALTH FIRE PREVENTION. AND PRESCRIBED FIRE CREWS THAT'S THE FIRST TWO LINES THERE UNDER THAT CATEGORY THE TOTAL TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I WANT OTHER POINT TO NOTE. IS THAT YOU'LL SEE THE UNDER FIRE RESPONSE ALL OF THE AUGMENTATION AND HAVE BEEN FUNDED THROUGH THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. WHEREAS THE FIRE PREVENTION OF FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN FUNDED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THEIR GIGI R. F. AS WELL AS- SOME FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT THIS IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH HOW WE FUNDED THESE ACTIVITIES IN THE PAST. GENERALLY FIRE RESPONSE IS FUNDED THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND IN PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT CAN BE FUNDED THROUGH VARIOUS SPECIAL FUNDS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. LAST A SECTION OF THE HANNAH IF YOU TURN TO PAGE STAFF ASKED THAT I SAY A FEW WORDS OF WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD YOU. CHOOSE TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST MANAGEMENT RELATED ACTIVITIES. I SHOULD JUST NOTED THE OUTSIDE OUR OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE A PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THAT WE ARE PROMOTING. OR OR SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I DID JUST WANT TO WALK THROUGH WHAT ARE A COUPLE OF THE OPTIONS THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE IN THE CATEGORIES OF OPTIONS AND WHAT ARE. SOME OF THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS YOU WOULD WANT TO KEEP IN MIND. IN A WAY IN THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS- CERTAINLY ONE SET OF OPTIONS AND WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT GENERAL FUND OR STATE SPECIAL FUNDS YOU COULD. LOOK AT REDIRECTING SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES WITH EXISTING RESOURCES. AND SPENDING MORE ON FOREST MANAGEMENT OR FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES- IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS ACTIVITIES REFLECT A HIGHER PRIORITY. IN IN THE NEAR TERM- YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT NEW TAXES OR FEES ESTABLISHING THOSE ARE INCREASING EXISTING TAXES OR FEES TO SUPPORT. DIRECTLY SUPPORT- MITIGATION AND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES I JUST AS AN EXAMPLE WE HAD A FIRE PREVENTION SHE- PHENOMENON IS S. ALREADY FEE. AND IN PAST YEARS- UNDER THE SIMILAR- APPROACH IN OF COURSE YOU ALSO CAN LOOK AT GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS THEY NOTED PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT HAVE BEEN USED. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT MANAGEMENT RESOURCES. THAT IS. AN OPTION. IF YOU TURN THE PAGE SIX. IN IN THINK ABOUT. HOW TO. DIFFERENT OFF DIFFICULT OF KEY. THAT WE FIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE FIRST IS REALLY JUST AROUND. I IDENTIFY. WHAT THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITY THAT YOU TO SEE. IF THE NOTE EARLIER THE ARE WHITE. OF DIFFERENT AT. THE STATE CAN. TO HELP US IMPROVE FOREST MANAGEMENT PREVENTION ACTIVITIES SO WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES YOU WANT TO TARGET. AND AT WHAT LEVEL OF HOPE TO FIND HOW MUCH REVENUE YOU WOULD NEED TO GENERATE. AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT IS THAT ONE TIME REVENUE OR IS THAT AN ONGOING OPERATIONAL PROGRAM SO THAT MIGHT SUGGEST FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER YOU WOULD WANT TO USE A BOND OR- SOME OTHER ONGOING REVENUE SOURCE. I'M ONLY WE THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHO SHOULD PAY- AND IT COULD BE THAT YOU HAVE. A COMBINATION OF SOURCES BUT OFFER UNDER WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHO THE BAND. OF CERTAIN- PROGRAM SO INSTEAD CASES WE THINK ABOUT AND IF THIS YEAR HAS BEEN A VERY BROAD BASE AND THEREFORE PERHAPS. YOU WANT TO ALIGN YOUR REVENUE SOURCE- WITH. A BROADER GROUP OF PAYERS AND SO- YOU KNOW JUST AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WILDFIRES WHILE MUCH OF THE IMPACT IS LOCAL WE SAW THIS YEAR IN PARTICULAR HOW MUCH OF THE AIR POLLUTION THE AIR IMPACT. WE'RE REALLY STATEWIDE AND WENT FAR BEYOND JUST THE- WILL BE OR. THE WILD LAND AREAS. IN OTHER CASES THERE ARE BENEFITS. THAT TEND TO BE MUCH MORE DIRECTLY. BY STATE PROGRAM AND THEREFORE MIGHT THERE MIGHT BE AN ARGUMENT FOR HAVING THEM PAY- WE- THINK ABOUT THAT-IN THE CASE FOR EXAMPLE OF. OUR OFFICES LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT HOW IMPROVE FOREST MANAGEMENT CAN HELP- BENEFIT WATER QUALITY WATER SUPPLIES AND SO IN THAT SENSE- WATER AGENCIES SOMETIMES ARE THE BENEFICIARIES. OF GOOD FOREST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND SO YOU COULD THINK ABOUT ARE THERE ARE WAYS TO GET THEM TO CONTRIBUTE. YEAH AND IN FACT WE KNOW THAT IN SOME CASES SOME WATER AGENCIES ARE UNDERTAKING FORCE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE AREAS AROUND SURROUNDING THEIR WATERSHEDS- AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO SOMETIMES THINK ABOUT THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE ARE THERE CERTAIN. CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PROBLEM THEY SHOULD BE PAYING A GREATER SHARE OF THE COSTS. IN SO AN EXAMPLE THIS MIGHT BE IT IN LOOKING AT UTILITIES AND HOW YOU. UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO FIRES IN PAST YEARS AND I'VE BEEN IN CERTAIN AREAS- BECAUSE. OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST. LAST POINT ON IS JUST OF COURSE AS A BUDGET COMMITTEE YOU'RE WELL AWARE THERE NO FREE LUNCHES THERE'S ONLY TRADE OFF WITH ANY OPTION THAT YOU LOOK AT- SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT. REDIRECTING EXISTING GENERAL FUND A SPECIAL FUND RESOURCES- THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE FEWER RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR OTHER BUDGET PRIORITIES TEXT TO YOU LOOK AT INCREASING TAXES OR FEES THAT MAKES SENSE BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE THEN. CHEAPAIR THE TAXPAYERS TO BEAR THOSE COSTS AND YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT FAIR IS THERE AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE COSTS AMONG DIFFERENT GROUPS. AND LASTLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE G. O. BOND OPTION. AGAIN THAT CAN BE. VERY APPROPRIATE BUT IT IS A ONE TIME REVENUE SOURCE INTO TECHNICALLY WE RECOMMEND USING THAT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OTHER ONE TIME COSTS NOT FOR ONGOING OPERATIONS- IN OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BE MINDFUL TO THAT. IT DOES- THE BOND ARE A FORM OF BORROWING AND SO THEN WE DO HAVE TO PAY THOSE COSTS. AND WE PAY THEM. WITH INTEREST OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. SO THAT CONCLU MY SOME REMARKS HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTION YOU MIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRIEST. ALL EXCUSE ME BEGIN A ONE CLASS ONE OF SOURCE THAT YOU DIDN'T. WAS THE- IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- IT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT THERE'S A- THERE SHOULD BE AN TRUST- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND OF PREVENTING. FIRES AND- IN PRESERVING RECREATIONAL LAND RESOURCES- PROTECTING AGAINST- THE CARBON THAT'S EMITTED WHEN- FOREST BURNS AND THE LIST GOES. ON AND ON. ARE THERE. I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION THAT ARE ARE THERE ANY EXISTING- PLACES TO TURN IN TERMS OF FEDERAL FUNDING OR WOULD WE BE STARTING WITH SCRATCH AND HAVING TO GO TO CONGRESS AND- ADVOCATE FOR THIS FROM THE- AS AS NEW FUNDING IF. WE WERE TO CHOOSE TO DO SO. YES IT IS A GOOD QUESTION- AND CERTAINLY NO IN CALIFORNIA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNS. THE MAJORITY OF. THE WILDLAND AREAS AND SO THEY CERTAINLY. HAVE THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO MANAGE THOSE LANDS. AND THEY PROVIDE SOME FUNDING TO DO SO BUT JUST ON THEIR LAND. THERE IS NOT MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING THAT IS PROVIDED TO STATE. FOR PREVENTION AND MITIGATION ACTIVITIES- CERTAINLY ON A FOR EXAMPLE S. ARE ALIENS. DATE THE ONE EXCEPTION I CAN THINK OF IS. WE SOMETIMES READ FEDERAL RECEIVE FEDERAL MEDICATION. RIGHT ARE USUALLY IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DISASTER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE. FUNDING IN THE STATE HAS SOME FLEXIBILITY HOW TO USE THAT FUNDING SO IT COULD BE IF TO. HELP IMPLEMENT PROJECTS THAT WOULD MITIGATE DISASTER BUT THATCOULD BE USED FOR WILDFIRE MITIGATION FLOOD MITIGATION OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITIES WHILE. AND SO WE AYE I SHOULD KNOW SO WEAK YEAH IN IN LIGHT OF THE DISASTERS THIS YEAR WE PROBABLY EXPECT TO SEE SIGNIFICANT MITIGATION FUNDS ARE COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND- OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND SO ONE THING YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT WE'VE RECOMMENDED THIS IN THE PAST IS THAT- WHERE IS YES TEND TO HAVE. A FAIR AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THAT MONEY IS ALLOCATED THAT COULD BE AN AREA WITH THE LEGISLATURE COULD GET MORE ENGAGED. AND PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE ON WHAT YOU THINK HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MONEY SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED. THAT'S INTERESTING. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THE DRESS. THANK YOU UGH IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDED BY THE LMAO- IT. THE POINTS OUT THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE FIRE SUPPRESSION AND FIRE PREVENTION IN OUR STATE'S BUDGET JUST ASYOU MENTIONED IN YOUR DISCUSSION NOW. GIVEN THE EXISTING OBLIGATIONS IN THE GENERAL FUND AND NOW ESPECIALLY WITH COVERT AND THE COSTS RELATED TO COVERT WHAT NEW REVENUE SOURCES SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER TO ADDRESS THE GAP. YEAH AND THAT WAS I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION I MEAN WE CERTAINLY SEEN WITH THIS IS VERY OF THE FIRE SEASON THIS YEAR. THAT THERE'S PROBABLY MORE- MORE ACTIVE YOU NEED THAT COULD BE DONE TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR COMMITTEE SAFER AND THAT THE FORCE HEALTHIER WE DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION ON WHAT THE RIGHT REVENUE SOURCE IS- BUT YOU COULD THINK FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT TO THE EXTENT THAT. IT MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHAT SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES THAT YOU- WHAT DID YOU WANT TO FIND SO IF YOU WANT A FUN FORCED ME AS HEALTH ACTIVE SO CLEARING FOR AND THEM L. THAT MY THERE THERE MIGHT BE REVENUE. YOU WANT TO USE THEIR IF YOU TO FOR THE- LOOK AT- THAT ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY TO PROTECT HOMEOWNER WITHIN THE S. ALREADY THE STATE HAD THE FIBER FEE IN THE PAST THAT- THE INTENT THERE WAS TO. ENSURE THAT THE PROPERTY OWNERS WITHIN THOSE AREAS WERE PAYING A FEE TO HELP WHICH THEN AT THE END AND THAT FEAR COULD BE TO PROTECT THOSE TO. AND SO I THERE WAS A BENEFIT. PAYS KIND OF PRINCE AND PLAY THEIR SO YOU CAN AT THOSE OF DOES BUT DIFFERENT REVENUE SOURCES DEPENDING ON THE- ACTIVE ONE OF. I THINK THE ONLY A POINT I'D ADD BECAUSE HE'S AREN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE SAID YOU. A COUPLEDIFFERENT YOU COULD HAVE CERTAIN FEES ATTACK DE FOR CERTAIN THAT YOU CAN USE TO FUND TO SUPPORT OTHER ACTIVE WERE THERE MIGHT NOT BE A CLEAR NERO SAID IF ANY. ARE CLEAR THAT YOU TO TARGET IN WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE THE BAND IS MY BROADER. MISTER BROWN WHAT. WHAT WAS THE OF MONEY WAS CHEN BY US OR FEW THAT WAS EFFECT A NOTE BROWN. **** AWAY A COUPLE YEARS AGO HOW MUCH WAS THAT GENERATING AND YEAH TO IF YOU COULD ALSO SAY TO KNOW I KNOW. AT THE TIME. OF THE FOR THAT WERE LOS FROM THE FACE WERE REPLACE I THINK BY FUND. AT. ALPHABET FROM CAP AND TRADE AND CAP AND TRADE HASN'T BEEN PRODUCING MUCH REVENUE HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO UP WITH THE FUNDING OF WAS ONE THE S. R. AMFI. YES SO ESTERASE CHEN. I DON'T HAVE EXACT BUT THEN IN THE NAME OF A FULL OR FIFTY NO DOLLAR AND YOU AND THEN AND YOU'RE RIGHT. IS PART THE EXTENT OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO TWENTY THIRTY. THE ACCELERATION E. Y. A LIMON. WITH THE PROVISION THAT CAPS TRADE A RATHER WOULD BE YOU TO BACK FILL. THE REDUCED FEVER. AND YES SO THE WAY THE PRO IS STRUCK CURRENT THE X. PROGRAM FOR CAP AND TRADE. IS THAT S. ALREADY BACK PHILIP ACTUALLY COME OFF THE IN SOME WAYS SIMILAR. THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION THAT WE HAVE WHERE THE SORT OF AT THE VERY BACK ALSO GETS FOR PRIOR. IN SO AT THAT IS CONTINUE TO BE FINE IN THE- EXPENDITURE PLAN. EVEN THE LEAN. THAT WE TO A YEAR SO. THE FORTY TO FIFTY MILLION WAS A TO BE. FOR AND THEN IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR- D. FIRST QUARTER AUCTION THAT WE HAD WAS BETTER THAN IT MAY NOT QUITE THE SAME LEVEL THIS PAST YEAR SO WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW THAT NEXT THREE OPTIONS DO. BEFORE WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH REVENUES OF AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE PROGRAM BUT AGAIN BECAUSE THAT THAT'S ALREADY BACK STILL ESSENTIALLY COMES OFF THE TOP IT'S GIVEN FIRST PRIORITY- YOU CAN FEELCONFIDENT THAT IT'LL BE. IT'LL BE FULLY FUNDED HI HI MS RIVAS. THANK YOU. YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSING MY- CONCERN WHICH IS THE UNCERTAINTY. OF THE G. G. R. F. AND HOW. YOU KNOW MOST OF THE- FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST MANAGEMENT. I'M FUNDING IS COMING FROM THE AUCTION PROCEEDS AND IF- YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR THERE ARE A LOT LOWER LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN. OF WHAT HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE. BOB THAT WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THE FIRE I MEAN THE FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE FORESTS. RIGHT SO IN PARTICULAR WAS NOT BEING FUNDED RIGHT NOW ARE THE FORCE MANAGEMENT FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS OF THE STATE- THE- THE BUDGET DID ALLOCATE SOME GINGER A FUNDING. FOR ITS STATE STAFF SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE THE PRESCRIBED FIRE CREWS THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS- THERE IS SORT OF ASSOCIATED WITH SB NINE UP ONE BUT- YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS OUR SUBSEQUENT AUCTIONS BRING IN RELATIVELY LITTLE REVENUE. THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO FULLY FIND ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HISTORICALLY FUNDED INCLUDING THE- FORCE MANAGEMENT FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS- IF THAT'S THE CASE THE LEGISLATURE THAT A COUPLE OF OPTIONS- BUT I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT- SO ONE OPTION IS TO- CENTER THAT WHATEVER REVENUE COMES AND GOING TO THE FOR THE FIND. YOU MAY NOT HAVE IT IN THAT CASE YOU MIGHT SIMPLY NOT HAVE A DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURE PLAN IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT WOULD MEAN THE END OF THOSE FUNDS ARE GRANTED OUR ARCH THOSE GRANTS ARE NOT FUNDED THIS YEAR BUT THAT MIGHT MEAN THE MONIES. AVAILABLE TO CUMULATE IN SPEND NEXT YEAR THE OTHER OPTION NOW IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES WANT TO PASS A DISCRETIONARY. PLAY IN FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE SAY AFTER- AFTER YOU COME BACK INTO SESSION IN JANUARY- THAT CERTAINLY YOU COULD YOU COULD CERTAINLY DO THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE LESS REVENUE TOTALED IN WHAT YOU'VE HAD IN THE PAST ULTIMATELY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME. CHOICES ABOUT WHAT EUROPE WHAT TO PRIORITIZE AND IF THAT IS THE FORCE MANAGEMENT GRANTS THAT MEANS OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'VE HISTORICALLY FUNDED OUT OF G. G. R. ASK. WOULD. HAVE TO RECEIVE LESS FUNDING. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS THAN- FOR- A WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION MISTER BROWN AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN. SOMETIME AFTER A WEEK AFTER WE START UP AGAIN IN JANUARY. AND WE'LL MOVE ON NOW AND INTRODUCE OUR SECOND PANELIST WHO IS NICK JENSEN NICK IS THE LEAD CONSERVATION SCIENTIST WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY. HE WILL HELP US GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF OUR STATE IN TERMS OF VEGETATION THEIR HISTORIC BURN CYCLES THE IMPACT CLIMATE CHANGE HAS HAD- AND ITS ECOLOGY AND WHAT ALL THIS MEANS FOR FIRE AND FIRE PREVENTION. MR JOHNSON. GOOD MORNING FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO SINCERELY THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AND RESCUE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU THIS MORNING. I'M NICK JENSEN LEAD CONSERVATION SCIENTISTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY ALSO KNOWN AS SI NPS. I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WILDFIRE NATIVE PLANTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW THOSE RELATIONSHIPS CAN AND INDEED SHOULD INFORM THE WAY WE MANAGE WILDFIRE GOING FORWARD. BEFORE I GET STARTED ON MY TESTIMONY. AT THE NATIVE CALIFORNIAN AND ALLOWING A LIFELONG RESIDENT I WANT TO SAY THAT I SINCERELY FEEL FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED FROM RECENT WILDFIRES. MY FRIENDS ARE AMONG THOSE VICTIMS. I ALSO FEEL FOR THE PURCHASE PONDERED FROM CAL FIRE THE FOREST SERVICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT PEOPLE PROPERTY AND ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES. IS THESE FOLKS WHO ARE INHERITING A NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. DRIVEN BY SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT I WILL ATTEMPT TO DISCUSS TODAY. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE LAND MISMANAGEMENT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND POOR PLANNING DECISIONS. I HOPE TO PRESENT A BALANCED PERSPECTIVE ON THE CAUSES OF AND SOLUTIONS TO THE CRISIS WITHOUT DIMINISHING THE EFFORTS OF THESE DEDICATED WORKERS AND THE COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS READING FROM WHAT. MY ORGANIZATION ST PS IS A SCIENCE BASED FIVE ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT WHOSE MISSION. IS PRODUCTION OF CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE PLANTS AND HABITATS. WATER ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARILY A THREAT TO NATIVE PLANTS. IS A PART OF THEIR NOT HAVE THEIR ECOLOGY AND NATIVE PLANTS HAVE LARGELY INVOLVED WITH FIRE. BUT DUE TO A NUMBER OF COMPLEX FACTORS WE FIND OURSELVES OUT OF BALANCE TODAY. NOW I HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE FLORA AND HABITATS OF CALIFORNIA FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES. GOING WAY BACK MY FIRST JOB AS A BOTANIST WAS DISTINCTLY TIED TO FIRE IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. AS A COLLEGE STUDENT I SPENT FOUR GLORIOUS SUMMERS WORKING ON HOW NATIONAL FOREST. ADD TO THAT LOOKING TO THE WEST OF LAKE TAHOE. I DON'T HAVE THIS PERSPECTIVE BACK THEN BUT I NOW REALIZE THAT NEARLY EVERY PROJECT I WORKED ON DURING THAT TIME PERIOD WAS DIRECTLY TIED TO WILDFIRE AND TO SOME DEGREE OUR LEGACY OF MISMANAGEMENT IN SOME OF THOSE FOREST HABITATS ALSO TO. TIED TO FIRE SUPPRESSION. MUCH OF THE SUMMERS I SPENT. BUT I WOULD SERVING FOR RARE PLANTS IN AREAS THAT HAD BEEN BURNED IN PREVIOUS YEARS BY WILDFIRES. PRIOR TO SALVAGE LOGGING OPERATIONS. ALSO SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS PULLING AN INVASIVE SPECIES CALLED MUSK THISTLE ON BOCA HILL WHICH IS LOCATED TO THAT JUST IT JUST TO THAT I GUESS SO TO THE NORTH OF TRUCKEE. ALL RIGHT MUST THIS OF THIS NASTY INVASIVE PLANT THAT IS THE- AND YOU KNOW TOUGH TO DEAL WITH. AND THAT PLANT WAS ACTUALLY INTRODUCED TO THE AREA ON FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT THAT WAS YOU KNOW IT THAT WAS A YOU KNOW OF COURSE NECESSARY TO FIGHT A FIRE IN THE AREA BUT WAS IS DIRECTLY TIED TO FIRE AS WELL. I THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW BACK TO THAT TIME PERIOD OR LIKE ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO. BACK THEN WE THOUGHT IT TWENTY THOUSAND ACRE FIRE WAS HUGE. AND OUR FIRE OF THAT SIZE WOULD BARELY EVEN MAKE THE NEWS. TODAY I WOULD CONSERVATION ADVOCACY FOR SI NPS AND HOPE OKAY EITHER WE CONCERT CONSERVE WHAT IS LEFT OF CALIFORNIA'S IRREPLACEABLE SPECIES AND HABITATS. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY. ALL PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S THIRTY SIX BUT GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS. APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF OUR FLOOR IS FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. AND SIMILARLY LARGE PERCENTAGES OF THE STATE'S PLANT A RARE WITH MANY OF THE SPECIES BEING PUSHED TOWARDS EXTINCTION. NEARLY ALL THE SPECIES BOTH COMMON AND RARE. HAVE EVOLVED AND HABITATS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY WILDFIRE. STEVE REFERRED TO GATHER AND FOR PATCHES OF VEGETATION OR YOU CAN CALL IT MORE CULT MORE SIMPLY HABITATS. EACH OF THESE HABITATS HAVE THEIR THEIR OWN UNIQUE RESPONSE TO FIRE. AND SO IT'S WITH THAT FRAMEWORK IN MIND THAT I SEE THE BIGGEST RISK WE SEE IS THAT THERE'S A BIT OF AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF OUR WELFARE CRISIS. AND ITS POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. IN THE MEDIA YOU OFTEN HEAR THAT THE CALLS A WILDFIRE CRISIS IS EITHER FORCED MISMANAGEMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. SOLUTIONS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT INCLUDE FOREST AND FUEL MANAGEMENT. AND ACTIVITIES IT AND REALLY IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT IN CALIFORNIA THERE REALLY IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION. I THINK THAT IN SOME REGARD WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT ONE HABITAT HABITAT TYPES WHICH ARE WHICH ARE FOR THESE FORESTS. AND REALLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TALKING ABOUT PLACES WHERE SO MANY OF OUR FIRES IN COMMUNITIES OF KIRK WOODLANDS GRASSLAND AND CHAPARRAL. LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT INHABIT THIS GREAT STATE. CALIFORNIANSHAVE HAD A REMARKABLY DIVERSE AND COMPLEX IN OUR APPROACHES THE WILDFIRE SHOULD BE THE SAME. IN THE REST OF MY TESTIMONY I'M GOING TO TALK THREE THREE OF OUR MOST COMMON VEGETATION TYPES FOREST CHAPARRAL AND GRASSLANDS. CHANCES ARE THAT EACH OF YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE OF THESE HABITATS TYPES IN YOUR DISTRICT. SOME YOU PROBABLY HAVE ALL THREE. ALL COMPARE AND CONTRAST HOW YOU TO THESE HABITATS ARE AFFECT BY WHAT. AND HELP PLENTY CALLED YOU CAN INFORM THEIR ASSOCIATED MANAGEMENT. NEXT I'LL SHARE WHAT WE DO AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE NEXUS BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE WILDFIRE IMPLANTS. LAST I WILL DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HOW ECOLOGY CAN AND SHOULD INFORM ACTIONS ESPECIALLY THOSE NON FORESTED REGIONS AND HABITATS. OTHER TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ALREADY. THE STORY OF WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO NATIVE TO THE NEED A FLOOR OF OUR STATE. HOW FIRE BEHAVES ON THE LANDSCAPE. IS A COMBINATION OF THE RESPONSES OF THOSE PLANS IN CONJUNCTION WITH. OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS LAND MANAGEMENT WEATHER PATTERNS AND CLIMATE. WITH THAT IN MIND I THINK WE NEED TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS. WHAT DOES VEGETATION CUT WHAT'S WHAT IS THE TYPE OF VEGETATION IN A GIVEN AREA TELLS ABOUT THE FIERY GENES AND ASSOCIATED RISKS. AND SECOND WHAT DO HABITAT TYPES TELL US ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD MANAGE FOR THESE RISKS. TO GET SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS I THINK LET'S START WITH LOOKING AT THE FOURTH AND I'LL FOCUS ON KIND OF THE MID ELEVATION PART OF HER FOR ITS THIS HERE IN ABOUT A. MANY FORESTED AREAS. ESPECIALLY THOSE AT MID ELEVATION HAVE EXPERIENCE A DEFICIENCY OF WILDFIRES. AND THAT THEY WANT TO BIRD AT A GREATER FREQUENCY. THIS IS IN PART DUE TO CENTURY OR MORE BUT A CENTURY OR MORE OF FIRE SUPPRESSION WHICH IS LED TO MAKING MILITIA FINE FUELS AND DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND UNDERSTOREY. I MEAN IF YOU'VE DRIVEN UP INTO THE SIERRA NEVADA RECENTLY MY TO SEEN HABITATS THAT ARE. SO THICK WITH SMALL TREES THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN BARELY EVEN SEE THROUGH THEM. AND THIS IS A BIT MORE YOU KNOW A BIT OR A LOT MORE DENSE. THAN WE WOULD HAVE OBSERVED. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A CENTURY AGO. NOW WHEN FIRES OCCUR IN THESE HABITATS- ONE TERM THAT IS USED TO DESCRIBE THOSE THOSE THAT DENSE GROWTH OF UNDERSTOREY IS LADDER FUELS. AND THAT THOSE FUELS CAN CARRY THE FIRE INTO THE CANOPY RESULTING IN SEVERE FIRE CONDITIONS AND HIGH TREE MORTALITY WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT NECESSARILY. THESE FIRES ARE ALSO A KOREAN SWAPS THAT ARE SO LARGE AND WITH SUCH RAPID HIGH SEVERITY. THAT RECOVERY OF SOME AREAS IS QUESTIONABLE. BUT HEREIN LIES THE PARADOX. WITH THAT WE NEED MORE FIRE IN THESE AREAS BUT NOT IN THE FIRE THAT FIRE THAT IS OF THE RIGHT KIND. FORSETT HABITATS- PLACE WHERE THERE IS ROOM ISN'T A ROOM FOR. SOME YOU KNOW ACTUALLY A GREAT DEAL OF OPTIMISM I WOULD SAY. IF WE CHOOSE TO LISTEN TO SCIENTISTS. AND OTHER GROUPS SUCH AS NATIVE AMERICANS WHO HAVE A HAVE MALENY OF LAND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE. ENABLE THAT KNOWLEDGE INPUT ACTIONS THAT ARE BOTH BENEFICIAL TO BOTH TO THE HABITAT. AND PROTECTIVE OF HUMAN COMMUNITIES. THESE INCLUDE THINGS ACTIONS LIKE PRESCRIBED TO MANAGE WILDFIRE. AND HE CULTURALLY ECOLOGICALLY INFORMED THING. WE CAN HAVE A WIN WIN SITUATION. MOVING ON FROM FOREST LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE ENTERS THOSE HABITATS LIKE- LIKE CHAPARRAL. DOMINATED BY SHRUBS. SOMETIMES KNOWN AS AS CHAPARRAL IN SOME PLACES COASTAL SAGE IT OTHERS ARE ARE THOSE ARE HABITATS THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD OF. THE CURRENT MANY PLACES STATEWIDE BUT ESPECIALLY PROMINENT ALONG THE COAST AND IN LOWER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE ALSO EXTENSIVE AREAS OF THESE TYPES OF HABITATS IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA. FIRE PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF CHAPARRAL HABITATS. JUST LIKE IN THE FORCE OF THE SIERRA NEVADA. THESE HOW DOES ABSOLUTELY NEED FIRE AT THE RIGHT INTO INTERVAL FOR THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE. BUT IN MARCH CONTRAST TO THE FOREST OF THE SIERRA NEVADA SOME OF OUR CHAPARRAL HABITAT HAS EXPERIENCE FIRE AT TOO FREQUENT INTERVAL ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SOME OF THESE ARE SOME OTHER PLACES HAVE EXPERIENCE FIRE AT WHAT WE CENTER THE PRETTY MUCH THE NORMAL FIRE RETURN INTERVALS. SO MORE FIRE THESE TYPES OF HABITATS IS NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD THING AT ALL. AND EVEN MORE SO. HIRES A BIRD TO FREQUENTLY OF THESE HABITATS CAN HAVE DRASTIC ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. ALTHOUGH MANY SHRUBS GROW BACK OR RE SEED AFTER WILDFIRE. THEY NEED TIME TO DO SO. AND IF FIRE RETURNS TO QUICKLY TO THESE HABITATS. INVASIVE PLANTS LIKE AN ORANGE LIKE NON NATIVE ANNUAL GRASSES CAN TAKE OVER. AND IT CAN LEAD TO SOMETHING THAT WE CALL TYPE CONVERSIONAND WHICH LEAVES- YOU KNOW WHICH ELIMINATES A NATIVE HABITAT AS WELL AS LEADING THAT HAPPENED AT THE HABITAT THAT IS DOMINATED BY NON NATIVE PLANTS EVEN MORE VULNERABLE TO. SUBSEQUENT WILDFIRES. FOR THAT REASON WE NEED TO REDUCE FIRE AND DISTURBANCE IN TRUCK DOMINATED HABITATS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THESE HABITS ARE ALREADYUNFORTUNATELY BURNING AT PROBABLY THE RIGHT INTERVAL OR ALREADY TO FOR AT TO FREQUENT INTERVAL. THAT MEANS. PRESCRIBED FIRE THESE TYPE OF HABITAT IS NOT SUCH A GOOD THING. AND SO WAS SOME OF THE DISTURBANCE MECHANISM SUCH AS LIKE MASTICATION- AND YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE. ACCIDENTAL FIRES THAT ARE SET BY HUMANS WOULD NEED TO BE REDUCED AS WELL. FOR THE CURRENT THESE TYPES OF HABITATS THAT ARE OCCURRING YOU KNOW IT'S JASON TO WORK RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF CHAPARRAL HABITATS. WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON HOLD A COMMUNITY HARD HOME HARDENING A COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND KNOW HOW TO EVACUATED AND WE'RE TO EVACUATE TO WHEN IT WENT ESSENTIALLY THE WHAT IS AN EVENTUAL WILDFIRE. CHERSON MINT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO THERE'S A SOME PRETTY. MARKET BECAUSE- BETWEEN THOSE TWO HABITATS THE FORCES HERE TO VOTE AND CHAPARRAL THERE IS TO IT AND WHAT WE MIGHT PRESCRIBE FOR ONE AREA IS NOT PRESCRIBED WELL TO ANOTHER. FINALLY LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GRASSLANDS AND MUSING GRASSLAND IN A VERY LIBERAL SENSE- IT'S A TERM THAT ENCOMPASSES A WIDE TO HAVE WIDE RANGE OF HABITATS FROM. YOU KNOW WHAT WE YOU KNOW THOSE WILDFLOWER SUPER BLOOMS THAT EVERYBODY GOES TO VISIT WITH A IN A GOOD RAIN YEAR. TED NATIVE PERENNIAL GRASSLAND. AND IT TOO VERNAL POOLS EPHEMERAL WETLANDS THAT ARE AMAZINGLY FILLED WITH TONS OF RARE. PLANTS AND ANIMALS. AND THE OTHER OFFER INTERSPERSED WITH OTHER. THEY CAN BE ADDRESSING THE CHOPPER. OR IT TO. OR INTO A LOT OF GRASS OCCURS I DO THE AND WHAT. MUCH LIKE THE REST OF OUR OF OUR FLORIDA MANY OR MOST OF OUR GRASS AND PLANTS. HAVE ALSO EVOLVED WITH FIRE. YEAH BUT WE N THE PAST THESE BARS WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY LOW YOU KNOW LOW TO MODERATE INTENSITY BECAUSE THEY WOULD'VE BEEN SMALLER AMOUNTS OF FUEL TYPICALLY IF ALL THESE PLANTS IT WAS ONLY NATIVE PLANTS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY MUCH OF OUR NATIVE DOMINATED GRASSLAND HABITATS AND EITHER BEEN DEVELOPED. ORIGIN CONVERTED INTO AGRICULTURE. AND WHAT REMAINS IS OFTEN A MIX OF A NATIVE SPECIES AND NON NATIVE GRASSES. ALL TOO OFTEN THESE NON NATIVE GRASSES OCCURRING HUGE QUANTITIES AND ACTIVISTS WATCHING YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY FLASHY FUELS TRIGGERING DESTRUCTIVE AND FAST MOVING WILDFIRES. TRAGICALLY ALSO A NUMBER OF OUR GRASSLAND AND WOODLAND HABITATS HAVE BEEN TO HAVE BEEN- REGARDLESS OF THEIR ECOLOGICAL VALUE. AND MANY OF THEM HAVE VERY HIGH ECOLOGICAL VALUE. HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS HIGH FIRE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SO MY ORGANIZATION HAS WORKED ON. ADVOCACY RELATED TO A NUMBER OF A LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN RECENT YEARS THAT EIGHT THAT ARE OCCURRING GRASSLAND HABITATS AND WOULD WOULD HAVE ATTACKED THAT ARE YOU KNOW ALSO IN VERY HIGH RISK HIGH RISK AREAS INCLUDING YOU KNOW DEVELOPMENTS ON TEJON RANCH CALLED CENTENNIAL IN NORTH NORTHERN L. A. COUNTY. HOLDINGS CITY PROPOSED IN GRASSLAND HABITAT IN HIGH FIRE OR VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES. MORE RECENTLY WE WORKED ON A PROJECT CALLED ONE OF VALLEY AT LAKE COUNTY. THAT IS DESIGNATED AS HIGH VERY HIGH VERY HIGH OR SEVERITIES OF. AND IT WAS APPROVED IN JULY AND NOT LESS THAN A MONTH LATER IN THE ALLEN YOU LIGHTNING COMPLEX FIRE THAT SAME AREA AT LEAST SUB AT LEAST THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THAT PROPERTY. THAT WAS A SLATED FOR DEVELOPMENT. BURNT IN THAT FIRE SO YOU HAVE A PROJECT APPROVED AND THAT BURNED IN WITHIN A MONTH. AND FORTUNATELY IT WASN'T BUILT YET BUT WHAT HAVE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THAT COMMUNITY WAS ALREADY IN PLACE. SO GENERALLY SPEAKING WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT IN THIS ECOSYSTEM THESE GRASSLANDS AND WOODLAND ECOSYSTEM INVOLVES REALLY. AVOIDING THAT CONFLICT IN THE FIRST PLACE I GUESS I COULD BE SAID FOR MANY OF THE OF THE HABITATS AS WELL IN THE STATE. AND WE'RE THESE AT WORK MEETINGS ALREADY EXIST. WE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HOME HARD NEED A DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS PUT INTO PLACE. AS WELL AS PROVIDES COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS MEASURES. SO SHIFTING GEARS A LITTLE BIT. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN VEGETATION HIRING CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M NOT A CLIMATE SCIENTIST A BOTANIST SO HOPEFULLY THIS IS A TO COUNTY. HI CHANGES CERTAINLY. IT CERTAINLY AND QUITE LITERALLY ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE. BUT AS A SIDE IS A BELIEVES DEEPLY IN THE URGENCY OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I ALSO WANT TO BE HONEST THAT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO SEPARATE THE MEDIA FACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FROM NATIONAL FOOT NATURAL PHENOMENA LIKE OUR AUGUST HEAT WAVE. THE ACCOMPANYING FREAK LIGHTNING STORM THAT OCCURRED IN NORTH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN A HISTORIC DROUGHT THAT OCCURRED A COUPLE YEARS AGO OF COURSE SOME OF THESE FACTORS MAY BE DRIVEN BY WILD BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESEARCHERS ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THESE FACTORS TO DIGEST DISSECT OUT THE CLOCK BECAUSE IT'S- BUT WHAT I WILL SAY. THINGS LIKE DROUGHT AND HEATWAVES AND LIGHTNING STORMS. HAVE BEEN A LONG EVER IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME. AND MAY BE ACTUALLY JUST EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. SO CAN BE A CHALLENGING THING TO DISSECT ALL THESE THESE PIECES. BUT HERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT WE KNOW A FEW TAKEAWAYS. FIRST LOOKING AT THE SIERRA NEVADA. A STUDY BY-EMINENT FIRE SIGNED HIS JOHN KEALEY AND ALEC SEIFERT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHOW THAT THERE IS AN INCREASE IN ACREAGE BURNED IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. WHEN IT WAS LINKED TO HIGHER SPRING AND SUMMER TEMPERATURES EITHER THE CONDITIONS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT AND ARE INGREDIENTS ARE OBSERVED IN OUR CURRENT CURRENT. WELL THE CLIMATE CHANGE. SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE IDEAL BURKE CONDITIONS ESPECIALLY WITH HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND LOWER PRECIPITATION THIS DECREASE PERCENTAGE OF PRECIPITATION. FALLING AS SNOW. AND YOU KNOW SO. YOU KIND OF YOU CAN START TO LOOK AT THIS WITH A MIX OF LATE. ADAM IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR LEGACY OF FOREST MISMANAGEMENT AND PART OF THE PERSON YOU CAN START TO SEE KIND OF A WORST CASE SCENARIO IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. LIKE I SAID BEFORE THERE IS SOME REAL- OPPORTUNITY FOR OPTIMISM IN THESE HABITATS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THIS IS THE TYPE OF HABITAT WHERE WE CAN DO SOME MANAGEMENT. SECOND IN NON FORESTED HABITAT FOR THE SOUTHERN OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A ESPECIALLY STRONG LINK BETWEEN INCREASED TEMPERATURES AND INCREASED RISK OF WILDFIRES. THIS IS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE BY RESEARCH BY KEELY ENCIPHEREDAS WELL AS FROM AND YOU KNOW IT A PROFESSOR AT A COURT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PARK WILLIAMS. AND CO AUTHORS IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ISN'T THAT IT'S ALMOST NEARLY AS WELL IT'S NEARLY ALWAYS HOT ENOUGH AND DRY ENOUGH FOR FIRES TO OCCUR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I MEAN WE DON'T I DON'T I LIVE THERE UP UNTIL A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S PRETTY EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU LIVE THERE. IN MANY CASES WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE LARGE FIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IS A MORE SO RELATED DEPRIVE A PREVALENCE OF LUCK. ON STRONG SANTA ANA WIND EVENT. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF EARLY SEASON PRECIPITATION. I'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE SANTA ANA WIND EVENT WHAT WE CAN DO WORK SOME SUGGESTIONS. OF LOOKING AT IT IN JUST A MINUTE OR TWO. THIRD I'D LIKE TO HIRE A HIGHLIGHTED AREA OF RESEARCH THAT IS INCREASINGLY TYING TOGETHER. CLIMATE CHANGE VEGETATION. AND FIRE. IT IS CALLED VAPOR PRESSURE DEFICIT AND THIS IS REALLY A BOTANIST TRYING TO EXPLAIN A CLIMATE TO LOGICAL. CLIMATE SCIENCE. SO HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT TOO A- TO- OUT OF- TO CONVICT. ASSEMBLY VAPOR PRESSURE DEFICIT MEASURES THE ABILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO ACT AS AS WHAT IS IT ASSEMBLY GIANT FUN SUCKING MOISTURE OUT OF ALL THE FUEL THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO BURN. BUT WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS. WELL WE KNOW THAT THAT CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE HAS WARNED WARMED BY ABOUT THREE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN THE PAST CENTURY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT VAPOR PRESSURE DEFICIT REACHED RECORD LEVELS THIS YEAR. AND RICHARD FIVE MICHAEL TALK TO COLLEAGUES. PUBLISHED THIS YEAR. FURTHER JUGGLING BETWEEN VEGETATION ARIDITY THAT INCREASING VAPOR PRESSURE DEFICIT AND CONSEQUENTLY INCREASE VIRUS SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SMOKING GUN BETWEEN THESE TWO FACTORS THIS CERTAINLY COULD BE A- OF COURSE THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY. ACCORDING TO JOHN KEALEY ESSENTIALLY NEAR ESSENTIALLY ALL A 100% OF ALL SANTA ANA. WIND DRIVEN FIRES ARE CAUSED BY HUMANS. AND FURTHER 99% OF THE- BUT 99% OF ALL FIRES IN COASTAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. AND HISTORICALLY ARE NOT CAUSED ARE ARE NOT OF NATURAL ORIGIN. SO IT'S A POPULATION INCREASES SO WILL THE NUMBER OF FIRE STARTS. AND WILL NOT ISN'T HAS WOULD INCLUDE IT MUST WE CHANGE THE WAY WE ACT OR THE WAY WE PLAN OUR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS. HORROBIN OF MY TESTIMONY THIS MORNING I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH SOME CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST AND FOREMOST. WE THE PLAN PREEMPTIVE MEASURES AND WILDFIRE RISK WITH NATURE AND WITH BIODIVERSITY IN MINE. IN THAT WE NEED TO TAILOR WIVES WHILE KERR SOLUTION BY REGION AND THE AND ALSO BY HABITAT. FOR EXAMPLE. AND FIRST WHAT SOLUTIONS LIKE PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT ARE GOOD FOR SOME PROBLEM ARCTIC OUR POTENTIALLY VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR CHAPARRAL AND OTHER TYPES OF HAVE HAS DOMINATED BY TRUCKS. NEXT IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED FIRE HOW WOULD BE PRESCRIBED FIRE IS IT IS IMPORTANT. SO THESE TO YOUR TREATMENT TO LIKE PROVIDE FIRE AND ECOLOGICAL BASE THE NAME. NEED TO BE PLANTED IMPLIED WITHOUT DIVERSITY IN MIND. FOR EXAMPLE- AIDED A PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE SPRING WHEN I STARTED WHEN FOR EXAMPLE. FOR EXAMPLE LIKE A RARE PLANT WOULD ALREADY GROWING COULD BE QUITE DAMAGING TO THAT RARE PLANTS THE SAME FIRE IMPLEMENTED THE FALL AFTER THAT PLANT HAS SET SEATS COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO IT. SO THERE'S SOME NUANCES TO THIS. SECOND THINGS LIKE EMERGENCY FUEL BREAKS FIREBREAKS. IF NOT MAYBE IT CAN BE A CONDUIT FOR INVASIVE SPECIES AND- CAN FURTHER INCREASE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE IN THESE COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THESE PEOPLE PARTS AREN'T MAINTAINED IN THE LONG RUN. I WOULD SAY THAT INSTEAD WEEK WE SHOULD REALLY. EMPHASIZE SOLUTIONS THAT LEAD TO THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DATA THAT IS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF HARM. FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE STARTING NOW. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF CRACKED THE FUNDING OF THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN FIRE PREVENTION. AND FIRE PRESERVATION. ACCORDING TO KATE GORDON. DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH. A DOLLAR SPENT AS A QUOTA DOLLAR SPENT TODAY SAVES YOU ABOUT SIX DOLLARS AND FUTURE EMERGENCIES. THIS REAL STITCHED IN TIME SAVES NINE STATISTICS IS. ONE WILL FACE PEOPLE SEE PEOPLE HOMES AND LIVES. THIS IS NOT TO SAY WE WILL NO LONGER NEED TO FIGHT WILDFIRES THIS IS NOT GOING AWAY. CLEARLY WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENABLE OUR FIRST RESPONDERS TO SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY. BUT THERE IS VAST ACREAGE OF FOREST HABITAT COULD BE THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM PRESCRIBED FIRE ECOLOGY INFORM LAND MANAGEMENT. THESE ACTIONS SHOULD NOT OCCUR WOULD NOT ONLY BENEFIT HABITAT BUT ALSO HELP TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE INTERSPERSED WITHIN THAT. YES WE KNOW THAT WINDERMAN FIRES ARE PERHAPS OUR MOST DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE FIRES. CASE IN POINT BEING THE FLYERS THAT YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE NAMES OF. THE CAMP FIRE TUBBS FIRE THE WILL THE FIRES TO NEIGHBORS TO JUST NAME A FEW. ADD THESE FIRE DEPARTMENT INTEGRATED AND NANCED APPROACH THAT INVOLVES SUCH THINGS AS FIRST PREVENTED FIRES IN THE FIRST PLACE KNOW THAT ALMOST ALL THESE CARS ARE ARE ARE STARTED BY HUMANS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. SECOND WE DO A BETTER JOB PLANNING. IT DID BETTER JOB OF PLANNING ENABLE DECISION MAKERS TO SAY NO TO DEVELOPMENT IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. WHEN WE ALLOW DEVELOPMENT IN THESE AREAS WE PUT PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES IF FIRST RESPONDERS AT RISK. THIRD WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT EXISING COMMUNITIES ARE RESILIENT TO WILDFIRE AND THIS MEANS DEFENSIBLE SPACE RECOMMENDATIONS SUPPORTED BY THE LATEST SCIENCE AND NOT DRIVEN BY FEAR. TWENTY FOUR IN ENABLING SWIFT EVACUATIONS AND HARDENING HOMES SO THEY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SUPPLIERS SURVIVING FIRES WHEN THEY INEVITABLY OCCUR. FINALLY WE CAN INVEST IN BETTER FIRE PROTECTION OF WEATHER FORECASTING TOOLS USING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY SO THAT FIRE CREWS AND HOMEOWNERS CAN BETTER PREPARE AHEAD OF THESE EVENTS. HOPEFULLY WITH SOME OPTIMISM. DESPITE OUR CURRENT CRISIS THERE'S THIS IS STILL A TIME TO LEARN AND LISTEN. WE NEED TO LISTEN TO FIRE SCIENTISTS LAND MANAGERS. NATIVE AMERICANS WITH THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF TRADITIONAL. KNOWLEDGE AND FIRST RESPONDERS TO SEE FIRSTHAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS IS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK MOMENT. LASTLY WHEN WE LOOK AT FIRE PREVENTION WE NEED TO GO BEYOND SIMPLISTIC FUELS MANAGEMENT TO TAKE A TAILORED APPROACH. THAT IS INFORMED BY HABITAT AND REGIONAL AND THE REGION'S AT THEIR CURRENT. KNOWING THAT. KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE STATE'S PART OF OUR CITY AND OF OUR VARIETY OF HABITATS THAT OCCUR HRE THANK YOU STE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- THAT VERY INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE QUESTION NINE BY ASKING YOU. WHAT MAY BE A SOMEWHAT PROVOCATIVE QUESTION A MUTE IS. I SPEAK ABOUT THE NEED FOR PLANNING- AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO WEAR- AND HOW- YOU WOULD RECOMMEND TO US WE CHANGE OUR PLANNING EFFORTS BECAUSE TO SOME DEGREE BECAUSE THERE THERE IS PLANNING THAT TAKES PLACE ALREAD SO. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO DO A BETTER JOB IN THAT RESPECT. YEAH THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS A PRODUCTIVE VOCATIVE QUESTION- AND OF COURSE I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD WOULD TAKE CONTROL OVER LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THEIR DECISION MAKING. BUT I WILL SAY ONE THING IS THAT. THERE ARE OTHER YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER AREAS OF THE I KNOW I KNOW OF THE COUNTRY ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO RISK LIKE LIKE FLOOD RISK. WE'RE THERE IS A HEIGHTENED DISINCENTIVE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF TO OCCUR IN THESE AREAS. AND I WOULD SAY THAT. IN SOME REGARD. WE MAYBE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE FACE TO FACE WITH THE TOUGH DECISION TO DO SIMILAR THINGS. IT WITH REGARD TO WILDFIRE RISK. IN THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO START DIS INCENTIVIZING DEVELOPMENT IN THOSE AREAS AND INCENTIVIZING DEVELOPMENT ELSEWHERE WE'RE SIMILAR REST ON A CURB. I ALSO THINK THAT WE COULD DO MORE TO DISCLOSE TO PROTECT TO HOMEOWNERS FOR HOMEBUYERS AND RENTERS ABOUT THE RISK OF- OF WILDFIRES IN THOSE AREAS BECAUSE THEN I WOULD YOU KNOW. I HATE TO THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE BY WHAT BY HOMES IN THESE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT THE RISK ACTUALLY IS. AND MAYBE IT COMES AS A SURPRISE WHEN THEY EVACUATED AND IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THEY LOSE THEIR HOMES. SO I REALLY THINK IT SHOULD BE MORE UP FRONT IN THOSE IN THOSE TYPES OF- YOU KNOW THOSE DECISION MAKING PROCESSES FOR PEOPLE- AND THEN OF COURSE. YOU KNOW WHEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES DO THEIR PLANNING EFFORTS WE COULD DO MORE TO ON. TO I THINK IT'S A DEVICE DEVELOPMENT AND MORE DENSE URBAN CORES RATHER THAN OF COURSE. LEADING DEVELOPMENT OCCUR IN THAT YOU KNOW THE OUTER CITY LIMITS NOW. THIS OF COURSE DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE ALREADY EXISTING DEVELOPMENT WHICH WHICH AREIN THE WILD EVERITT URBAN INTERFACE WHICH WE STILL NEED TO DO A LOT MORE TO- TO MITIGATE FOR THOSE RISKS THERE AND THAT THOSE AREAS AS WELL. THANK YOU AND WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT AT THE OF THE STATE LEVEL- ARE WE- STRUCTURE THE WAY WE NEED TO BE- ARE THERE CHANGES THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND. TO THAT WE MAKE IN ORDER TO. A BETTER ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. WELL YOU KNOW THERE WHAT I AM BLANKING ON THE BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED THAT DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK WHICH WOULD WOULD HAVE BAND- DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DEVELOPMENT AND VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES AS AS OWNED BY CAL FIRE. THAT'S A BILL THAT THAT MY ORGANIZATION SUPPORTED. AND DONE. ALL RIGHT WE CERTAINLY WOULD WOULD SUPPORT SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN THE FUTURE AND IT THAT'S A THAT'S A STEP I SUPPOSE THE STATE COULD TAKE. THE STATE LEVEL. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MS FRIEDMAN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT MAYBE I'LL ASK THEM ALL THREE AND THEN YOU CAN ANSWER THEM SUPPOSED TO COMING BACK OF THAT WORKS FOR YOU YEAH- THE FIRST ONE- IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE MR BLOOM'S QUESTION BUT INSTEAD OF ASKING ABOUT PLANNING EFFORTS AS WE'RE BUILDING NEW PROJECTS I'M WONDERING OUTSIDE OF THE HOME HARDENING AND WHAT INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS CAN DO TO MAKE THEIR OWN PROPERTY MORE RESILIENT. IF YOU HAVE IDEAS ABOUT COMMUNITY WIDE RESILIENCY OR RISK MITIGATION AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION- THE SECOND ONE IS ABOUT- THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FUEL REDUCTION BY- THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT FUEL REDUCTION BUT THERE'S BEEN LESS CONVERSATION ABOUT TYPES OF FUEL AND I'M WONDERING HOW CHANGING THE FUEL TYPE HOUSE HOW COMMUNITIES CAN LOOK AT CHANGING FUEL TYPES AS A PART OF THAT AND I GUESS PART OF THAT MY LAST QUESTION IS. IN MY AREA AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE STATE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS FROM THE FIRES AND CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO- INVASIVE NON NATIVE PLANTS AND THE REPORT THE ACTUAL REPORT. THAT WAS GIVEN AS PART OF THE COMMITTEE MATERIALS. THE IS A US LOOKING AT THE CAUSE OF FIRES AND THEY POINTED SPECIFICALLY EUCALYPTUS IN SOME AREAS. AND I KNOW IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE. I LIVE IN WERE A BUNCH OF US UP HERE LIVE. A LOT OF THE NON NATIVE GRASSES THAT ARE MIXED IN WITH THE SHOPPER ALL I'M TOLD ARE MUCH MORE FLAMMABLE THAN FOR INSTANCE THE POPULAR FAVORITE PLACE AND OTHER. NATIVE SHRUBS NATIVE GRASSES. DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW THE REST OF LARGE SCALE RESTORATIONS OF THESE NATIVE SYSTEMS CAN HAPPEN I'VE HEARD. MIXED THINGS ABOUT SEATING- IT SEEMS LIKE A NON NATIVES ARE JUST THEY'RE JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH WHETHER IT'S A RUN GO IN THE CREEKS OR THE LEFTIST. IS IT IS THE SOLUTION ROUNDUP I MEAN WHAT WHAT DO WE DO TO DEAL WITH IS A GOATS- WHAT CAN WE DO IT ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE WAY TO GET BACK TO THE- BETTER ADAPTED NATIVE PLANTS. SO I KNOW THOSE ARE THREE JUMBLE QUESTIONS BUT- ANY COMMENT YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. SURE I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION I ASKED WAS ON COMMUNITY WIDE RESILIENCE IDEAS. WELL I THINK THAT- I THINK THESE YOU KNOW IT INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY TO BE MADE STRONGER IF. THERE IS TRULY DISPENSABLE SPACE AND ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW IN ALL THE HOMES THAT OCCUR IN THEM. AND THAT COULD INCLUDE OF COURSE YOU KNOW FROM OURS PERSPECTIVE APPROPRIATE NATIVE PLANT LANDSCAPING. I THINK ALSO. I MEAN FOR ON MID WILDFIRE MITIGATION MEASURES IN THE AREAS AROUND THESE COMMUNITIES. IN A IN THE IN A VERY JUDICIOUS WHY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE I MEAN IF IT IT'S EASIER IN PLACES LIKE THIS YEAR AND ABOUT I SUPPOSE WHERE WE'RE BY- THE AREAS THAT ARE KIND OF DISTORTING IT'S KIND OF DISTANT FROM THAT COMMUNITIES COULD BE TREATED WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND THEN. THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY LESSEN THE RISK OF THESE OF A FIRE ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO PENETRATE INTO THOSE EXISTING COMMUNITIES. OF COURSE YOU KNOW COURSE HOME HARDING IS A BIG DEAL I THINK THAT'S ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS AND I WOULD SAY THAT IN A BILLION- I MEAN IT'S- I'VE- THESE SOLUTIONS ARE ALWAYS LIKE. FOR ME IT'S A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE TO SAY WE WANT TO DO THESE THINGS BUT THEN I'M THINKING LIKE. DO DO HOMEOWNERS ACTUALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES. AND TO CREATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND TO ALTER THEIR LANDSCAPING SO. I MEAN MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE A SOME SORT OF GRANTOR OR LOW INTEREST LOAN PROGRAM. THAT ENABLES PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY DO THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TELLING THEM. IS NEEDED. IT'S NOT THE PEOPLE ME NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE THEIR HOME BURNED BY A WILDFIRE IT'S JUST THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY. TO MITIGATE FOR THAT THOSE THAT IT THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY ASKED. NOW I WANT TO ADDRESS THE WHOLE IDEA OF LAND A LARGE SCALE RESTORATION I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE AS AN ORGANIZATION I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AS A AS A AS A AS A PERSON WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THESE HABITATS. I REALLY THINK THAT IT NEEDS TO BE A YOU KNOW THAT A TOKEN APPROACH. SCALE TO THE PROBLEM AND SKILL TO THE AREA THAT WE WANT TO TREAT. THERE ARE THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME CASES WHERE- THESE KIND OF NON CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES MAY BE MAY BE NEEDED I DON'T I'M NOT SURE ABOUT GRAZING BY CODES. BECAUSE THAT COULD ALSO BE DAMAGING BUT BUT MAYBE. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE BEST THING THAT WE CAN DO IS. X. IT IS TRYING TO ENVISION WHAT WE WANT TO SEE OUT OF THIS OUT OF THE URBAN YOU KNOW THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. AND THEN. AND THEN TALK TO THE SCIENTISTS TALK TO THE PRACTITIONERS TALK TO. THE FIRE PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS. AND TO WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THESE. INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS THAT THAT WILL THAT HAVE BOTH BY DIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION IN MIND. AND CERTAINLY YES ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO GET RID OF A LOT OF THE INVASIVE PLANTS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S SO EASY. I MEAN IT'S NOT EASY IN IN PRACTICE NECESSARILY BUT IT'S SUCH AN EASY THING TO. FOR US TO PROMOTE BECAUSE- IT IT HAS A GREAT ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS IT REDUCES FUEL LOADS. IT'S A WEEK IT'S A WIN WIN SITUATION I LOVE WIN WIN SITUATIONS SO. I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE ANSWERED ALL YOUR QUESTIONS YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO ASK THEM AGAIN IF I DIDN'T DO A GOOD ENOUGH JOB. THANK YOU MS RAMOS. THANKS SO MUCH- IN ONE OF THE QUOTES THAT SAID ALMOST CATASTROPHIC FIRES OF THE PAST FEW DECADES HAVE BEEN WIND DOMINATED FIRES YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. EARLY THESE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL THEIR HAPPENING AND WE JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH THEM. NO I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU SAID THAT THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HERE WITHOUT GIVING US SOME HOPE SOMETIMES WHEN I HEAR ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE. THAT WANT TO DEVELOP IN FIRE PRONE AREAS NO MATTER WHAT WHEN I WHEN I HEAR THESE THINGS. SOMETIMES IT IT TAKES AWAY WHATEVER HOPE I MIGHT HAVE- BUT IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE TO BE SURE TO HAVE. THE SCIENTISTS WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE WHO'VE STUDIED- IT SUCH AS YOURSELF AT SOME POINT THEY HAVE YOU AT THE TABLE. WHEN WE'RE PLANNING SO MY QUESTION AND OF COURSE WERE TOKENS OF SOMETHING SIMILAR TO- CHAIR BLOOM AND- IS FRIEDMAN. BUT IT. IS IT IS IT IN ZONING. CLEARLY WE NEED MORE PLANNING- IS IT IS IT A TEN YEAR PLAN SO THAT WE START TO TURN THINGS AROUND- WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED- SO THAT WE CAN SO THAT THE STATE. CAN ACHIEVE SOME NORMALCY WHEN IT COMES TO TWO FIRES- WE CAN'T PREVENT THEM BUT- WHAT CAN WE DO TO REALLY HAVE A PLAN. THAT'S GOING TO HELP US MITIGATE THE V. THE DISASTER THAT WE'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THE RECENTLY. YEAH IT I THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL ASPECT OF PEOPLE REALLY KIND OF A DESPERATE AT THIS POINT IN TIME I KNOW THE FIREFIGHTING PERSONNEL DON'T LIKE THIS SITUATION THE HOMEOWNERS DON'T LIKE THIS SITUATION YOU AS AS LAWMAKERS ARE ARE ARE REALLY- I THINK STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS. AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE IS THERE IS THAT THERE IS THAT THE NOW SOLUTIONS SO AND FOR AND FOR EXISTING COMMUNITIES SO FOR INSTANCE. WE HAVE WE HAVE HOMES I MEAN. WE YOU WE ALL HAVE SEEN IT WE HAVE SEEN YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER WATCHED A WILDFIRE ON THE NEWS. OR YOU KNOW JUST IN RETROSPECT STUDY WHAT'S HAPPENING. YOU KNOW THAT THESE WIND DRIVEN FIRES THEY JUMPED EIGHT LANES OF FREEWAY- THEY'LL JUMP ACROSS THE RESERVOIR. YOU DON'T SPOT A MILE AND A MILE IN YOU KNOW. A MILE IN ADVANCE OF THE FIRE FRONT. THERE ISN'T I MEAN. THERE ISN'T YOU KNOW A HUGE AMOUNT THAT WE CAN DO TO PREVENT THOSE WILDFIRES FROM PROGRESSING. NOW I DO LIKE THE HOME HER NAME IS A REAL SO IS A REAL PART OF THE SOLUTION WE KNOW THAT IF YOU KNOW YOU PREVENT THAT YOU KNOW- MEMBERS FROM BEING SUCKED UP INTO THE EAVES OF THE HOUSE IS AND I'M SURE THE FOLKS FROM CAL FIRE HOOK SPEAKER LATER TODAY PROBABLY WILL WILL CAN DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF THIS KIND OF AN ANSWER THAT I CAN'T. IT PREVENTS IT WOULD PREVENT A LOT OF HOMES FROM BURNING. ALSO DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS A BIG THING SO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE OF THOSE HOMES HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. SO THAT WHEN. I FIRED IT IS ADVANCING. IT'S NOT THAT. THE FIREFIGHTERS DON'T HAVE TO CLEAR BRUSH OR JUST KIND OF. GIVE UP BECAUSE I ME THEY NEVER GIVE UP BUT LIKE. THEY MIGHT HAVE TO GET IN THERE BECAUSE IT JUST REALLY IS INDEFENSIBLE IS INDEFENSIBLE. NO THOSE ARE AND THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW. KNOWING THAT THESE FIRES ARE GOING TO OCCUR IN THESE COMMUNITIES. WELL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN EVACUATE I MEAN THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG THING. SO SECONDLY I WOULD SAY LIKE PHOTO THAT'S FOR THOSE THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE AREAS THAT ARE THAT ARE NOW THREATENED. I THINK WE NEED TO DO WE HAVE NEED TO HAVE A REAL HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO PREVENT. MORE OF THESE COMMUNITIES BEING BUILT IN THOSE- IN IN AREAS THAT ARE AT A VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS. A REALLY COMPLEX ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S OLD THERE'S LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS AND PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THAT KIND OF THING AND PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THEIR PROPERTIES. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT WOULD WE DON'T DEVELOP IN THESE AREAS IT'S KIND OF A THAT'S A WIN WIN WIN WIN SITUATION AND THAT WE'VE- ESSENTIALLY CREATED CONSERVATION LAND. AS WELL AS PREVENTED THESE AREAS FROM FROM ACTUALLY BEING- YOU KNOW NEW HOMES FROM BEING AT RISK. FROM WILDFIRE. SO MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN START DOING IN INCOME CITY LANDOWNERS AND MAKING IT AND DID AND INCENTIVIZING CONSERVATION INSTEAD OF. OF THE DEVELOPMENT IN THESE AREAS AND I DON'T I DON'T UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE A I'M NOT A MAGICIAN I DON'T HAVE ANY I MEAN I MEAN I'M- NOT A MIRACLE WORKER I GUESS I DON'T HAVE ANY. ANY WORK OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION YOU CAN WE CAN APPLY TO THIS THIS THIS REALLY- CHALLENGING CRISIS. WE DON'T SELL YOUR SHORT. WHAT IS RISKY TO JOIN ONE FOLLOWER IN THE LITERATURE YOU GAVE US FOR INSTANCE FOR FIRE FOREST YOU SAID PRESCRIBED FIRES- AND BURNING UP BUT FOR GRASSLANDS YOU SAID THAT THAT THAT IT'S- IT'S THAT THE- IT'S THE HOME. AND BUILDING RESTRICTIONS AND THEN FOR TWO CHAPARRAL YOU SAID CONTROLLED BURNS ARE EXTREMELY HARMFUL. SO IF AND FOR THOSE YOU ALSO RECOMMENDED THE HARDENING AND THE BUILDING RESTRICTIONS. IT WHEN I TALK ABOUT A TEN YEAR PLAN OR SOME PLAN. YOU'RE RIGHT WE WANT SOMETHING NOW BUT WE NEED TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE. SO IF WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN PUTTING TOGETHER A TEN YEAR PLAN AND WHO WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO BE PART OF THAT. PLANNING COMMITTEE. SO I'LL JUST FOCUS ON THAT THE FOR THE FOREST PORTION OF THIS SO. WE CAN DO WE GET THIS I THINK THE STATE AND OF COURSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL THEY DO A LOT MORE INVESTMENT IN- IN PRESCRIBED FIRE- THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO NOW START NOW AND INVEST. IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. IF WE WERE TO PUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IN THAT IN PRESCRIBED TIRE. AND SOME LAND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND AREAS THAT DESPERATELY NEED IT. WE WOULD REPEAT A LOGICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS REDUCE FIRE RISK IN THESE AREAS SO. I OULD SAY THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ONE THING THAT YOU CAN START NOW. AND IF WE INVEST IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE GREAT BENEFITS. ALSO I'D SAY THAT WE CAN START YOU KNOW LIKE YOU KNOW THIS IS. IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S HARD TO PREDICT I MEAN ART NEXT YEAR WILL PROBABLY BE ANOTHER BAD FIRE YEAR WELL OKAY. WE KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO WE CAN START NOW. AS FIRE SEASON HOPEFULLY DIES DOWN OF THE OF COURSE WE'RE IN A RED FLAG WARNING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AGAIN TODAY- BUT HOPEFULLY THERE'S NO NEW FIRES IN AND HOPEFULLY IT'LL START RAINING SOON SO WE CAN ACTUALLY START GETTING TO SOME OF THESE PREVENTIVE MEASURES. AND DOES INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE HOME HARDENING AND COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS. I THINK IT'S- ALL OF US. TO NOT FORGET ABOUT WILDFIRES WHEN IT STARTS RAINING AND IN THE END OF THE IF YOU KNOW IN. DECEMBER NOVEMBER JANUARY WHENEVER IT STARTS RAINING. AND THAT WE ACTUALLY KEEP I MEAN. KEEP THE FIRE LIT ON FIRE SO THAT ACTUALLY WE DON'T ACTUALLY JUST WE SAY LIKE OKAY GREAT THE TIRES SEEMS OVER THE RISK IS OVER WELL ACTUALLY. THAT'S OUR TIME TO START PREPARING IT'S OUR START TIME TO START. AARON FOR THINGS LIKE BY PRESCRIBED FIRE. IT'S OUR TIME TO START FOCUSING ON ON ON MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO RESPECT DEFENSIBLE SPACE. SO I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO. AND I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S AS LONG AS WE KEEP ON INVESTING THINGS I SEE THAT THE SITUATION COULD GET BETTER- YOU KNOW IS BECAUSE EACH CHANGE THAT WE MAY. HOPEFULLY THAT'S WHAT THE HOMELESS BETTER PROTECTED OR FOURTH IT'S A BETTER. MORE RESILIENT. SO IT ACTUALLY WILL NOT BURN AT SUCH A HIGH SEVERITY. MS RIVAS AND THEN MISTER TANK HAS A QUESTION. YOUR RECOMMENDATION AT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION WAS THAT WE NEED TO TAILOR. WILDFIRE SOLUTIONS BY REGION AND HABITAT- I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED SOME OF YOUR- VIEWS ON THIS BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT EVALUATING OUR CURRENT STATE EFFORTS IS THERE A PARTICULAR REGION HABITAT THAT ONE WE'RE DOING WELL AND THAT YOU WOULD. OF SAY CALIFORNIA IS DOING WELL- AND ANOTHER MAYBE THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING MORE OF OUR EFFORTS ON. AFTER THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT'S A HARD QUESTION- I WON'T PRETEND TO KNOW. TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE- I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM SOME OF THE AREAS IN OUR IN OUR NATIONAL PARKS LIKE SEQUOIA KINGS CANYON SOMEBODY. WHERE THEY'VE BEEN ACTUALLY ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ON A PRESCRIBED FIRE AND KIND OF HABITAT MANAGEMENT FOR FOREST HEALTH AND RESILIENCY OVER THE DECADES AND SO YOU'LL SEE IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE. IT DIDN'T OCCUR THE CONDITIONS OF THOSE FORESTS ARE ARE MUCH BETTER THAN YOU WOULD SEE AN ADJACENT AREAS THAT ARE THAT MIGHT BE PRIVATE FOREST LANDS OR OTHER OTHER IS A NATIONAL FOREST. THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED AS MCH EFFORT SO THERE ARE EXAMPLES WE'RE WE'RE WE HAVE DONE REALLY GOOD THINGS WITH REGARD TO FOREST AND HABITAT MANAGEMENT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. NOW I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW I'M YOU KNOW NOT TO NOT TO BE A BROKEN RECORD HERE IN AND FOCUSING ON THE SAME THINGS I WOULD SAY THAT AS WE GET TO. OBTAIN AREAS THAT AREN'T THAT REALLY ARE IN THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE WHERE THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AT RISK- HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED. I THINK THAT IT'S A STATEWIDE WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF PREPARING THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR WILDFIRE AND THAT IS YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THE CLASSIC THINGS DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT IS THAT IS PLANNED YOU KNOW CORRECTLY. PROCREATE LANDSCAPING- AND ALSO FOR YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE HOME HARD NEED IS SOMETHING THAT THAT REALLY WORK WE'RE REALLY JUST YOU KNOW OVER AND OVER AGAIN EMPHASIZING AS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE. AT IN PLACE ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS WHERE WIND DRIVEN FIRES OCCUR. SO I MEAN I SAY THE KNOW. AND OF COURSE. OUR YOU KNOW. WE DON'T HAVE GOOD I THINK IT JOB AS- OUR FIRE FOR CREWS. BUT I THINK WE ALSO OUR PRESCRIBED FIRE CREWS BETTER. SO FUNDING THOSE FOLKS HO HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE. IN THERE I PROBABLY WHAT'S IN THEIR OFF SEASON OR WHATEVER. WHEN THEY'RE NOT FIGHTING FIRES THAT WE COULD EMPLOY SOME OF THOSE FOLKS TO DO SOME PRESCRIBED FIRE USE THOSE SKILLS FOR. YOU KNOW FOR. ALTERNATELY. FOR EIGHT GRAND ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS. OUR NEXT SPEAKERS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT I WOULD CALL TO YOUR ATTENTION- EVERYONE IN YOUR PACKET THERE'S A HAND OUT- THAT'S- THAT THAT- ACRONYM IS CLOSED- IN LARGE LETTERS AT THE TOP AND THAT'S IT- A COLLABORATIVE- EFFORTS. IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT ADDRESSES MANY OF THESE ISSUES AND MAY PROVIDE US WITH A MODEL THAT WOULD BE APPLICABLE ELSEWHERE. CHURTON THANK YOU MR HI JUST A QUICK QUESTION YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR- PRESENTATION SORT OF BRINGING. ADDRESSING DRAMATIC FUNDING IMBALANCE BETWEEN FIREFIGHTING WILDFIRE PREVENTION WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE IN TERMS OF WILDFIRE PREVENTION. WELL I WOULD SAY I DON'T HAVE THE I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I SEEM TO I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE SPENT SOMETHING LIKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS ON. ON FIRE SUPPRESSION AND I THINK MAYBE LIKE IS IT LESS THAN 10% ON ON THE ON FIRE PREVENTION TEN PERCENT. RIGHT OKAY SO I WOULD SAY THE REAL EASY FIRST STEP WOULD BE TO BRING THOSE TWO CLOSER TOGETHER- I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE AND I'M NOT SAYING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT WE SPEND ON SUPPRESSION WE NEED TO DO THAT WELL HOPEFULLY MAYBE OVER TIME IF WE DO FIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS. MAYBE WE'LL START TO START STOP HAVING TO SPEND SO MUCH MONEY AND SUPPRESSION. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. SHOWS THAT IF WE DO THESE KIND OF. PREVENTIVE MEASURES. IT ACTUALLY BECOMES CHEAPER FOR US TO FIGHT THE FIRE FIGHT FIRES IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WITH IT THAT A KIRK. OR THIS PARTY STILL BECOME AS LARGE. OR THEY DON'T THREATEN THE COMMUNITIES IN TH SAME WAY. AND SO REALLY I THINK THIS IS A THIS IS YOU KNOW WE'RE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO. SO THERE. I THINK THAT THAT WE COULD- IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A MUCH RELIEF TO OUR FIREFIGHTING PERSONNEL S WELL AS THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO. YOU KNOW. BEYOND AND YOU KNOW WORKING AS HARD AS THEY CAN FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS ON END MAYBE THAT FIRE SEASON COULD GET A LITTLE BIT SHORTER. MAYBE YOU COULD GET A LITTLE BIT LESS INTENSE. AND WE CANNOT BUT FEWER HOUSES BURNED IN PURE PEOPLE'S LIVES THREATEN TO THAT TYPE OF THING SO. I THINK THAT THAT THAT. THAT YOU KNOW DECREASING THAT GAP. WOULD BE WHAT WOULD WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING. WHAT WHAT WHAT AREASWE CAN DEFINITELY. REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OUT OF STATE OR OUT OF AREA RESOURCES THAT WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BRING IN WHEN. WE HAVE THESE PRETTY CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IS SO. WHAT YOU TO ONE OF THOSE CHALLENGES HAS BEEN. REGARDING WHETHER IT'S IN A VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OR- PRESCRIBED BURNS IS REALLY- NOT JUST THE- MONEY BUT REALLY FINDING THE PEOPLE. AND THE ORGANIZATIONS TO EXECUTE IT SO. IF WE WERE ABLE TO- INCREASE THE FUNDING IN THIS AREA- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER- OTHER PEOPLE COULD REALLY. ABSORB THAT KIND OF SCALE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S BEEN. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE BEEN HEARING IS WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN ACTUALLY SCALE. THESE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK I THINK WE CAN IT MAY TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME- WELL COURSE WORK WE'RE IN A IN A PRETTY BAD. ECONOMIC STATE IN THIS IT RIGHT NOW BASED YOU KNOW DO THE COVERAGE. BUT YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE I THINK THIS COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO FIND YOU KNOW WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF WORK. THERE ARE ALSO YOUNGER PEOPLE. WHO HAVE. WHO HAVE BEEN RAISED WITH THAT WOULD YOU KNOW HAVE GROWN UP WITH THIS WILDFIRE CRISIS ON. ON THE FOREFRONT OF THEIR MIND. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THESE FIRES THAT. THAT WOULD PROBABLY JUMP AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND SO I WOULD SAY FUNDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND TRAINING PROGRAM SO THAT WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS LIKE PRESCRIBED FIRE. WOULD BE. I THINK AN INCREDIBLY USEFUL THING. AND IT WOULD GET IT WE KIND OF YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW KILL TWO BIRDS AT THE SAME TIME HERE AND THAT WE COULD PUT MORE PEOPLE TO WORK. WHILE ALSO SOLVING THIS THIS REALLY POTENT PROBLEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION MISTER JOHNSON THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS- SPARKED A LOT OF CONVERSATION HERE ON THE DIETS AND TO I'M SURE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER WHO IS MICHAEL O'CONNELL THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE IRVINE RANCH CONSERVANCY. AND MICHAEL HELP US BETTER ON THE BETWEEN WE DRIVEN. VERSUS YOU DRIVEN FIRE AND THE APPROACH FIRE PREVENTION MEASURES FOR EACH AND I MAY HAVE STOLEN HIS THUNDER A LITTLE BIT BY- TALKING ABOUT- THE COAST ORGANIZATION BUT I'M- SURE HE CAN GO INTO A LITTLE GREATER DETAIL ON THAT AS WELL. SO WELCOME MR O'CONNELL. WELCOME MR O'CONNELL. WHY DON'T WELL WELL WE'RE A TRACKING DOWN MR O'CONNELL MAYBE WE COULD TAKE ROLE. THERE IS WE CAN HEAR YOU YES. FOR A GREAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE ROLES IS VERY BRIEF I THINK YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW YES CAN YOU HEAR ME. YEAH HI I CAN RIGHT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ROLE AND THAT'LL JUST TAKE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS. HELLO FONG GARCIA MULLIN PATTERSON RAY YES RIVAS TANG FRIEDMAN. WELCOME MR O'CONNELL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU DIDN'T STEAL MY THUNDER AT ALL YOU GET ME THE PERFECT A SEGUE TO HER IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT SO I APPRECIATE THAT UP. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL O'CONNELL AND I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE IRVINE RANCH CONSERVANCY. WE'RE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IN ORANGE COUNTY. I'VE BEEN THE CEO OF THAT ORGANIZATION SINCE ITS FOUNDING IN- TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND BEFORE THAT I SPENT THIRTEEN YEARS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY INCLUDING SEVERAL YEARS AS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL DIRECTOR. I ALSO SERVE ON THE DEAN'S LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR THE SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IRVINE. NUMB I'VE BEEN WORKING IN- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHRUBLANDS FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS BOTH IN PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF THOSE SYSTEMS. AND SO I WANT TO SPEAK FROM THAT TODAY. THE IRVINE RANCH CONSERVANCY IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WE MANAGE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES OF PUBLIC LOCALLY OWNED PUBLIC LAND COUNTY AND CITY LAND IN ORANGE COUNTY MOST OF IT PART OF THE HISTORIC IRVINE RANCH. AND OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP THOSE LANDS HEALTHY AND RESILIENT AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO ENJOY THEM AS WE BEGAN MANAGING THAT LAND WE DID WHAT LAND MANAGERS OFTEN DO WHICH WAS TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE THREATS TO THE HEALTH AND RESILIENCE OF THOSE LANDS WERE. AND IT TURNS OUT NO SURPRISE THAT THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT TO RESILIENCE OF OUR LANDS THAT WE MANAGE AS WELL AS MOST OF THE SHRUBLANDS ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS TOO FREQUENT FIRE- SO WE BEGIN TO LOOK INTO THAT. ONE THERE'S ONE POINT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH TODAY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IF YOU DON'T RMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT MY TESTIMONY IT'S THIS. AND THAT IS THAT CALIFORNIA ESSENTIALLY HAS TO FIRE CHALLENGES AND WE ARE CURRENTLY RESOURCE TO AND STRUCTURED AND IMPLEMENTED TO REALLY ONLY ADDRESS ONE OF THEM A MORE CONVENTIONAL CHALLENGE AND WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT EARLIER- WHICH IS THE FUEL DOMINATED FIRES. WE ALSO HAVE HEARD THAT THERE ARE NGUYEN DOMINATED FIRES ON I WANT TO DRAW THE DISTINCTION A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR YOU BETWEEN THOSE BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO UNDERSTAND THOSE DIFFERENCES THEN YOU CAN START TO BUILD SOLUTIONS FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM. SO FUEL DOMINATED FIRES GENERALLY HAVE TO DO WITH HAVING TOO LITTLE FIRE PLUS PASSED SILVICULTURAL PRACTICES OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THAT HAVE CREATED ESSENTIALLY A TENDER BOX- THAT CAUSES FIRES TO BE MORE. SEVERE LARGER AND MORE CATASTROPHIC WHEN THEY DO OCCUR THERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE FUEL LOADS IN THESE SYSTEMS. AND THE SOLUTIONS TO THEM ARE LARGELY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS THINNING FORESTS AND PRESCRIBED FIRE IN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. CATASTROPHIC FIRES ARE INCREASING IN THOSE SYSTEMS OVER TIME DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WITH FUEL DOMINATED FIRES IGNITIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY EXCLUSIVELY HUMAN CAUSED. LIGHTNING IS OFTEN AND HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A- SOURCE OF IGNITION IN THOSE SYSTEMS. BUT I WANT TO SPEND MOST OF MY TIME TALKING ABOUT WIND DOMINATED FIRES BECAUSE IT'S A VERY VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEM AND IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE UNDER. STAND THAT SO THAT WE CAN START TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT. CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHRUBLANDS ESSENTIALLY SANTA BARBARA TO SAN DIEGO. ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG SEASONAL WINDS AND THEY ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF FUELS. THE SPREAD OF THOSE FIRES IS CAUSED BY WIND NOT BY FUELS. WIND DRIVEN FIRES ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPRESS THROUGH CONVENTIONAL ATTACK. WE'VE HEARD HOW THE EMBER CAST CAN GO ACTUALLY UP TO FIVE MILES DOWN WIND. AND LIGHT HOUSES ON FIRE IN THE INTERIOR OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT EVEN ON THE WILDLAND EDGE AND THAT MEANS IT'S AN EXTREMELY UNCONVENTIONAL SITUATION. COMPARED TO HOW WE'VE TRADITIONALLY THOUGHT ABOUT WILDFIRE AND FIGHTING WILDFIRE. IN OUR SYSTEM FIRES ARE OCCURRING 90% MORE FREQUENTLY THAN NATURAL RETURN INTERVALS THESE SHRUBLANDS HAVE ADAPTED TO A SEVENTY TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS- RETURN INTERVAL ON FIRE WHICH MEANS THE FIRE HAPPENS AGAIN EVERY SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS. AND WE'RE GETTING FIRES IN THE SYSTEMS EVERY SEVEN TO TEN YEARS WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S 90% OUT OF WHACK THERE'SALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT THAT CAUSES ONE OF THEM IS BAD IT CAUSES CONVERSION OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY HARDER TO BURN FUELS INTO FLASHY FUELS THAT ARE EASIER TO IGNITE. AND THEY KERRIER THE KERRY THE FIRE UP MORE EASILY AS WELL SO IT'S KIND OF THIS DOWNWARD SPIRAL. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT IN OUR NGUYEN DOMINATED SYSTEMS LIKE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHRUBLANDS CAUSED EITHER ACCIDENTAL OR ITS INTENTIONAL AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY COMPLICATED DIFFERENT TYPES OF IGNITIONS. FROM CAR- CATALYTIC CONVERTERS BURSTING TO POWER LINE FIRES TO ARSON- TO ACCIDENTAL- EIGHT SOURCES OF ALL TYPES BUT 99% OF THE FIRES THAT WE GET OR HUMAN CAUSED SO FIRE PREVENTION IS PARAMOUNT IN WIND DRIVEN SYSTEMS. OVER 90% AND THIS IS I'M TALKING ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY SO WE'VE LOOKED AT THE HISTORICAL IGNITION DATA IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT 90% OF THE IGNITION'S FOR FIRES OCCUR ALONG ROADWAYS AND UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. NINE OUT OF TEN A. MISSIONS. AND ONLY 10% OF IGNITIONS. WHICH OCCURRED DURING THESE WIND EVENTS BECOME CATASTROPHIC FIRES AND THOSE OF THE FIRES THAT DO THE MOST OF THE DAMAGE SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LEVERAGE AND I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH WILDFIRES WHERE'S OUR LEVERAGE IN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. IT TURNS OUT THAT IN NGUYEN DOMINATED SYSTEMS THERE IS A AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE IN IGNITION PREVENTION DURING SANTA ANA WIND EVENTS IN OUR REGION IT'S BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR DAYS A YEAR WE JUST GOT FOR OUR SECOND ONE. OF THE YEAR OVER THE WEEKEND AND THERE ARE SEVERAL MORE PREDICTED FOR THE MONTH OF COMING UP IN NOVEMBER BUT IF WE CAN PREVENT OR REDUCE IGNITIONS DURING JUST THOSE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR DAYS A YEAR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE- THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM OF WILDFIRE. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN THAT IGNITIONS THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THESE WINDOWS VENTS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY EASILY SUPPRESSED IN ORANGE COUNTY THIS YEAR WE'VE HAD OVER TWO DOZEN FIRE IGNITIONS AND NONE OF THEM MADE THE NEWS BECAUSE THE FIRE AUTHORITY AND THEIR PARTNERS IN THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS JUMP ON THEM RIGHT AWAY. AND THEY KEEP THEM TO TWO ACRES OR LESS CERTAINLY FAR LESS THAN TEN ACRES THAT'S BECAUSE THE WINDS ARE NOT DRIVING THEM IN FACT JUST THIS WEEKEND THERE WAS AN IGNITION THAT OCCURRED IN TO PAYING A CANYON. IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS AND IT WAS RIGHT AFTER THE WINDOW VENT OCCURRED AND THE FIRE WAS STOPPED AT LESS THAN TWO ACRES AND IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WIND TO DRIVE IT. SO IF I LEAVE YOU WITH NOTHING TODAY IT'S V&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; JUST THAT THAT WE HAVE TO FIRE PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME TRYING TO ADDRESS THE CONVENTIONAL PROBLEM. OF FOREST FIRES WHEN IN FACT WIND DRIVEN FIRES IN SHRUBLANDS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND THE FACT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND BECAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE THERE'S A LOT OF LEVERAGE AND THERE. SO THE SECOND THING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN ORANGE COUNTY TO TRY TO DEAL WITHTHAT AND I THINK IT DOES PRESENT PREVENT OR PRESENT A GOOD MODEL FOR HOW WE MIGHT DEAL WITH THIS. IT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY CHIEF. RECOGNIZE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT WHICH WAS THAT. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT IT ISN'T POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO SOLVE ALONE. IN FACT WHAT HE SAID WAS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SO YOU CALL AFTER THE FIRE BREAKS OUT. AND OUR PROBLEM IS ONCE THE FIRE BREAKS OUT IN ITS WIND DRIVEN THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT WE CAN DO. AND THAT'S A REAL ISSUE AND SO WHAT HE DID. WAS HE CONVENED A GROUP THAT WE CALL THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AREA SAFETY TASK FORCE. WHICH IS COAST BUT IT'S THE FIRE PREVENTION WORKING GROUP. AND IT'S MORE THAN TWO DOZEN AGENCIES ORGANIZATIONS LAND MANAGERS- UTILITY COMPANIES ROAD AGENCIES. EVERYONE WHO HAS A PART. IN WORKING ON THE ISSUE OF WIND DRIVEN FIRES IN OUR SYSTEMS. AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER AND WE'RE ALL WORKING ON IT. AND IT'S A SITUATION WHERE. THERE ISN'T ANY FINGER POINTING THERE ISN'T ANY BLAME BEING CAST EVERYONE IS BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THE SAME GOAL WHICH IS REDUCING. THE FREQUENCY THE SPREAD AND THE SEVERITY OF THESE WIND DRIVEN FIRES. SO THE LAST SIX YEARS AND MY ROLE IN IT IS THAT I WAS NOMINATED- BY THE GROUP TO BE THE FACILITATOR. OF THAT GROUP AND SO I HAVE BEEN THE FACILITATOR FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS. AND WE'VE DEVELOPED A COMMON AGENDA. FOR THE GROUP ON WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET DONE- THAT INVOLVES THE COMPLEXITY OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE WIND OF ADS. THE TRICKY THING IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT A FUELS BASED SOLUTION. ON WIND DRIVEN FIRES AND SHRUBLANDS. THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS TO IT RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT 83% OF OUR FIRES IN ORANGE COUNTY ARE IGNITIONS AND ORANGE COUNTY START. ALONG PRIMARY ROADWAYS. THAT MEANS THE PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT OF THE COUNTY AND CALTRANS NEED TO BE INVOLVED. THEY AREN'T NECESSARILY STARTING THE FIRES THEM SELVES AND SO BRINGING THEM TO THE TABLE IN GETTING THEM TO WORK ON THESE SOLUTIONS WITH EVERYONE ELSE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. LIKEWISE WITH THE UTILITIES WE HAVE 11% OF OUR IGNITIONS STARTING ALONG UTILITY QUARTERS AND BRINGING SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC WHICH SERVES THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF ORANGE COUNTY. AS WELL AS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO THE TABLE AND WORKING CONSTRUCTIVELY HAS BEEN A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF IT. THE CURRENT FIRE CHIEF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY BRIAN FENNESSY HAS DOUBLE OR TRIPLE DOWN ON THIS IDEA BECAUSE HE REALIZES THAT A COHESIVE APPROACH WHERE EVERYONE IS WORKING TOGETHER. IS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE THINGS THE FIE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE IT IN THEIR POWER TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THESE KINDS OF FIRES. SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESSES AND THOSE ARE IN THE LITTLE FACT SHEET. THAT IS PART OF YOUR PACKET I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE- THE PEER REVIEWED PAPER ON WEDNESDAY VERSUS FUELS THAT'S INCLUDED AS WELL. THAT'S SORT OF THE FOUNDATIONAL PIECE OF SCIENCE THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO FIRE REGIMES AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. SO THE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IS THAT IS WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS THAT WERE WORKING ON WHAT WHAT HAVE WE DEVELOPED WHAT IS OUR COMMON AGENDA. N ORANGE COUNTY THAT EVERYBODY IS PULLING IN THE SAME DIRECTION ON- AND THAT'S THREE THINGS AND WE ACTUALLY HEARD ABOUT MOST OF THEM- IF NOT ALL OF THEM TODAY BUT THERE ARE THREE THINGS AND ALL THREE OF THEM HAVE TO BE DONE. EFFECTIVELY IN ORDER TO GET AHEAD OF THIS AND MANAGE THIS- CATASTROPHIC FIRE PROBLEM. THE FIRST THING AND I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THAT ENOUGH IGNITION PREVENTION DURING WIND EVENTS. IGNITION PREVENTION ALONG ROADWAYS IGNITION PREVENTION ALONG POWER LINES AND IGNITION PREVENTION IN AREAS THAT ARE HOT SPOTS FOR THOSE IGNITIONS WE CAN LOOK AT THE HISTORICAL DISTRIBUTION. OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE IGNITIONS AND WE CAN FIND OUT THAT THEY ACTUALLY OCCUR IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S A CONVERGENCE OF HIGH TECHNICIAN IN HIGH SPREAD POTENTIAL. AND IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH IGNITIONS IN THOSE AREAS YOU HAVE REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE. THE COMMISSION PREVENTION ABOVE ALL ELSE. THE SECOND THING AND WE'VE TALKED SOME ABOUT IT TODAY'S IS STRUCTURE RESILIECE- IT TURNS OUT THAT IN ORANGE COUNTY 80% OF THE STRUCTURES THAT HAVE BURNED. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS DO NOT MEET BASIC FIRE CODES- MANY OF THEM ARE IN THE INTERIOR OF COMMUNITIES THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT BURNED DOWN BY THE FIRE FRONT. SO THEY'RE NOT HELPED BY IT BY DEFENSIBLE SPACE OR EVEN FUEL MODIFICATION ZONES THEY ARE BURNED DOWN BY THE EMBER CAST. FROM ALL I'LL TELL YOU JUST A LITTLE STORY TO ILLUSTRATE THIS SO I LIVE IN A- HIGH FIRE PRONE AREA- NEAR A WILDERNESS PARK IN ORANGE COUNTY AND- I WAS UP ON MY ROOF THIS SUMMER- PUTTING SCREENING OVER MY FENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT NO MEMBERS WOULD GET AND IF WE EVER HAD A FIRE. AND I STOOD UP AND I TURNED AND LOOKED AT MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. AND SHE'S IN HER LATE EIGHTIES AND SHE'S ON A FIXED INCOME AND SHE'S ON THE HOUSE FOREVER AND- I LOOK HER. AND SHE HAD CEDAR SIDING. CEDAR SHAKES ON HER ROOF AND A YARD FULL OF PAPER BARK EUCALYPTUS TREES. AND I THOUGHT THERE'S MY FIRE PROBLEM IT'S NOT MY HOUSE IT'S THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR. AND WHAT THAT ILLUSTRATES IS NOT ONLY AND SHE'S NOT A UNIQUE SITUATION WHAT WHAT WE HAVEIS WE HAVE COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PREPARED AND ARE NOT RESILIENT FOR FIRE. THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY ACTUALLY HAS A PROGRAM THAT THEY CALL READY SET GO WHICH IS REALLY WELL DONE THERE'S A WEBSITE ABOUT IT. IT'S VERY CLEAR- HOW TO GET PREPARE NOT ONLY YOUR HOME AND YOURSELF TO BE READY TO- FOR A FIRE AND ALSO TO EVACUATE FOR A FIRE. IT REACHES A FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE THAT IT NEEDS TO AND THE PROGRAMS AND THE AND THE COST. OF FIXING SOMEONE LIKE MY NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE SHE CAN'T AFFORD IT AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT- SHE ACTUALLY HAS A- A LARGE PALM TREE THAT EVERY YEAR GETS REALLY RATTY AND FULL OF DEAD FRONDS. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE OFFERED TO ACTUALLY PAY TO HAVE THAT- TRIMMED EVERY YEAR BECAUSE IT'S AS MUCH A FIRE RISK TO MY HOME AS IT IS. TO HER HOME SO STRUCTURE RESILIENCE IS THE SECOND LEG OF THE STOOL THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE- THE COAST WORKING GROUP. AND THEN THE THIRD THING AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH IS NOT LANDSCAPE SCALE FUEL REDUCTION IN SHRUBLANDS. ALL OF THE SCIENCE SHE POINTS OUT THAT THAT MAKES VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE ON THE SPREAD OF FUELS IN TROUBLING IS BECAUSE THEY'RE DRIVEN BY WIND. NOT BY FUELS. IN SAN DIEGO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES BURNED. A THIRD OF THAT LAND HAD BURNED ONLY FOUR YEARS PREVIOUSLY WHICH MEANT THAT IT WAS ALL JUST ANNUAL GRASSES THAT CARRIED THE FIRE. SO WHAT WE NEED THOUGH IS WE NEED STRATEGIC FUEL MODIFICATION ZONES- AND THEY'RE ALSO KNOWN AS DEFENSIBLE SPACE THERE'S A LOT OF SCIENCE THAT SHOWS THAT A THIRTY METRE. ENVELOPE AROUND THE PERIMETER OF A COMMUNITY CREATES NOT ONLY DEFENSE ABILITY FOR FIREFIGHTERS BUT IT ALSO- IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE RESILIENCE OF THE PERIMETER OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND NOT JUST REMOVING VEGETATION COMPLETELY THE TYPE OF FUEL THAT OCCURS IN THOSE FUEL MODIFICATION ZONES IS ALSO REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT WE'VE DONE A PROJECT WITH THE CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH- WHERE WE CREATED WHAT WE'RE CALLING A WATER WISE FUEL MODIFICATION PROJECT. WE'RE IN THE FUEL MODIFICATION ZONES AROUND ONE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WE ACTUALLY LANTED HEVIER FUELS AND MORE FIRE RESISTANT FUELS NATIVE FUELS. LIKE CACTUS AND REALLY WOODY VEGETATION THAT ACTUALLY IS LESS FIRE PRONE THEN THE ANNUAL GRASSES THAT OFTEN INVADE A- A POORLY MAINTAINED FUEL MODIFICATION ZONES SO IT'S NOT JUST THE DESIGNATION OF THESE ZONES IT'S ACTUAL. RIGOROUS MAINTENANCE OF THESE ZONES- IF YOU GET UP IN A HELICOPTER AND FLY OVER SOME OF THE COMMUNITIESIN NORTHERN NORTHEAST ORANGE COUNTY- LIKE YOUR BEINDA AND BREA YOU'LL SEE BACKYARDS. THAT BORDER UP TO WILD LANDS THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DEFENSIBLE SPACE BEHIND THEM EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A DESIGNATED FEL MODIFICATIONS ON THERE. AND THAT'S JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE SO WORKING TOGETHER IS REALLY THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IS AN UNCONVENTIONAL PROBLEM AND WE ARE SET UP TO DEAL WITH CONVENTIONAL PROBLEMS LIKE OF FOREST FIRES AND FUEL TREATMENTS WHEN IN FACT IT INVOLVES PREVENTION OF IGNITIONS ALONG ROADWAYS. AND SURVEILLANCE- TO PREVENT ARSON. ALL MENTION ONE OTHER PROGRAM WE'RE WORKING ON AND THEN- ALL ALL TAKE WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. AND THAT IS- A PROGRAM THAT MY ORGANIZATION RUNS BUT THAT IS FUNDED BY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE THE CITY OF IRVINE AND THE CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH. IT'S CALLED ORANGE COUNTY FIRE WATCH. AND IT'S A VOLUNTEER RUN ORGANIZATION MY ORGANIZATION SIMPLY ADMINISTERS THE PROGRAM WE TRAIN THE VOLUNTEERS WE DEPLOY THEM AND WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY VOLUNTEERS THAT ARE TRAINED BY THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY. AND WHAT THEY DO IS DURING HIGH WIND EVENTS THEY ACTUALLY ARE STATIONED OUT ON THE LAND- IN AROUND THE PERIMETER MOSTLY ALONG ROADWAYS MOSTLY IN PLACES WHERE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF IGNITIONS. AND THEIR GOAL IS TO BOTH PREVENT INTENTIONALLY MISSIONS LIKE ARSON AND THEY'RE ALSO TO REPORT AS QUICKLY AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN ANY IGNITIONS THAT THEY MIGHT SEE SOMETIMES A MATTER OF FIVE OR TEN MINUTES IN RESPONSE. BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FIRE BEING KEPT SMALL AND ONE THAT GETS OUT OF HAND AND CAN BURDENS LARGE MANY THOUSANDS OF ACRES ON A LANDSCAPE AND DO LOTS OF STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AS WELL. SO THIS PROGRAM HAS ACTUALLY BEEN IN PLACE INCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN- IT WAS RECENTLY ENHANCED BY A GRANT THAT WE GOT- FROM THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SAFE COUNCIL FUNDED BY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO CREATE- MALT WE BOUGHT MONITORS THAT ARE ATTACHED TO A HIGH SPEED WIRELESS NETWORK. THAT SERVE AS VIRTUAL FIRE TOWERS AND SO PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY NOT PHYSICALLY ABLE TO GO OUT AND STATIONTHEMSELVES. OUT AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THESE LANDS ON FIRE WATCH THEY ACTUALLYSIT IN% THE IN THE OPERATIONS CENTER WITH THESE AND CONFIRM MAN FIVE OR SIX VIRTUAL FIRE TOWERS AT THE SAME TIME. AND THAT HAS BEEN A BIG SUCCESS IN ADDITION TO JUST RAISING THE AWARENESS IN ORANGE COUNTY. SO I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING- I THINK THAT IT'S A MODEL FOR PLACES AROUND THE STATE I CANNOT SAY AT ALL THAT WE'VE GOT THIS THING LICKED BY ANY MEANS EVERY TIME THE WIND BLOWS IT'S WHITE KNUCKLE TIME AROUND HERE. AND BUT WE ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CAN TO TACKLE THIS REALLY UNCONVENTIONAL PROBLEM. OF WIND DRIVEN FIRES IN SHRUBLANDS IS A PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU AGAIN I'M GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER TESTIMONY FROM DOWN HERE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU- VERY- INTERESTING PRESENTE AND- OF THE MAGNIFICENT BEGIN WITH A- COUPLE OF. QUESTIONS THIS ISSUE OF ADMISSIONS- ALONG ROADWAYS. HAS VEXED ME SINCE. THE FIRST TIME I BECAME AWARE OF IT WAS A FIRE I THINK IT WAS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS. STARTED BY A CAMPER THAT IT PULLED OFF THE ROAD- NEEDED TO SERVICES VEHICLE I THINK. AND THE FIRE STARTED UNDERNEATH. THE VEHICLE AND BEFORE THE DRIVER WAS VIRTUALLY OUT OF THE CAR- IT ALREADY TRAVELED UP THE- OF THE- THE EMBANKMENT- THAT WAS NEARBY. AND IT BECAME A VERY VERY LARGE FIRE WHAT WHAT STRATEGIES- ARE BEING CONSIDERED. TO DEAL WITH THAT VERY SERIOUS ISSUE. YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND IN FACT- THE SOURCES OF IGNITION ALONG ROADWAYS ARE ACTUALLY HIGHLY VARIED AND PRETTY COMPLICATED THEY RANGE AS I MENTIONED FROM WE HAD ONE CALLED THE FREEWAY COMPLEX FIRE WHERE A CATALYTIC CONVERTER BURST AND I DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CATALYTIC CONVERTERS BUT THEY'RE INTENDED TO OPERATE AT ABOUT. FIFTEEN HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND THEY ARE MADE OF CERAMIC AND THEY MELT AT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND IT BURST AND UP PIECES OF MOLTEN CERAMIC CAME OUT THE TAIL PIPE AND LIT. AT LEAST A DOZEN IGNITION POINTS ALONG THE ROADWAY WE'VE HAD FIRE STARTED BY MAINTENANCE PRACTICES WE'VE HAD FIVE STARTED BY PEOPLE PULLING OFF INTO THE DRY GRASS- WITH A HOT UNDERCARRIAGE IN THEIR CAR AND STARTING FIRES WE'VE HAD CHAINS DRAGGING LIKE WHAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING. WHAT ALL THAT LEADS TO IS IF YOU TRY TO FOCUS ON THOSE SOURCES OF IGNITION YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS. WHAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON IS HARDENING THE ROADWAY AGAINST ALL KINDS OF IGNITION SOURCES IF YOU MAKE IT HARDER FOR FIRE TO GET OFF THE ROAD BECAUSE AN ACCIDENTAL SOURCE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU CAN. PREDICT OR YOU CAN NECESSARILY EVEN PREVENT% LIKE YOU CAN IF YOU WITH ARSON DETERRENCE- IF YOU- IF YOU IF A FIRE STARTS ON THE EDGE OF THE ROADWAY AND IT CAN'T GET OFF THE ROADWAY INTO THE DRY BRUSH OR INTO THE WILD LANDS. THEN YOU'VE CONTAINED IT AND SO WHAT WE I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE ROADWAYS. AS NOT THESE OPEN. SYSTEM TO OPEN PATHWAYS THROUGH OUR WILD LANDS BUT THEY NEED TO BE CLOSED CORRIDORS ALMOST LIKE A TUNNEL THAT FIRE CAN'T GET OUT OF. AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS YOU COULD DO THAT YOU COULD DO IT BY. SIMPLY REMOVING VEGETATION FAR ENOUGH ALONG THE EDGE IN CERTAIN PLACES AND I'M NOT ADVOCATING THAT EVERYWHERE IN FACT IN SOME AREAS. RESTORING HEAVIER FUELS RIGHT DOWN TO THE ROAD THAT MAY BE A BETTER STRATEGY WE HAVE A TOLL ROAD IN ORANGE COUNTY THE SAN JOAQUIN HLLS TOLL ROAD. AND IT HAS SOME VERY VERY STEEP HILLS WHICH TURNS OUT UP HILL GRADES IS WHERE A LOT OF THESE. ACCIDENTAL IGNITIONS OCCUR BECAUSE YOU GET A CAR BACK FIRING OR WHATEVER. AND WE HAD FAR FEWER IGNITIONS CATCH AND BECOME FIRES ON THAT TOLL ROAD. AND ALLOW IT WE DON'T THERE'S NEVER BEEN A SCIENTIFIC STUDY DONNA BUT A LOT O THE FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN IN THE FIRE SERVICE A VERY VERY LONG TIME. I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE MANY PARTS OF THAT TOLL ROAD HAVE. HEAVY FUELS RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD ROADBED SO WHEN A CHAIN DRAGS IT'S NOT GOING TO CATCH A WOODY BRANCH ON ON FIRE LIKE IT WOULD FLASHY FUELS. SO KIND OF A LONG WINDED ANSWER BECAUSE IT'S VERY COMPLICATED BUT THE MAIN POINT IS WE NEED TO LOOK AT HARDENING THESE ROADWAYS TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR IGNITIONS TO GET OFF OF THEM. SO THAT THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING RESPONSES AND- IT IT DOES LEAVE MAY TO SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS IN ADDITION TO. WHAT YOU SUGGESTED CHANGES TO THE ROADWAY THAT THAT NEED TO BE MADE THAT WE ALSO NEED TO EDUCATE MOTORISTS- SO THAT MOTORISTS DON'T MAKE SOME OF THE MISTAKES THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED- IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE COULD BE A ROLE FOR CALTRANS IN THIS- AT AND AS WELL THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES- BOTH AGENCIES HAPPEN TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE SO THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE MAY WANT TO HELP. GOING FORWARD THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU. HI IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE MADE A LOT OF. PROGRESS IN IDENTIFYING THE RISKS AND TO- COLLABORATING AND WHAT THE SOLUTION SHOULD BE- WITHIN COAST. WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS FOR YOU HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT TESE- THESE PLANS. FOR AT. OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS WITH COAST HAS BEEN NUMBER ONE GETTING EVERYONE TOGETHER AND COLLABORATING TOGETHER AND SHARING THE AGENDA AND THE WAY I LIKE TO SAY IT IS EVERYONE IS BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH NONE OF US ARE INDIVIDUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE PROBLEM IT'S LIKE IT'S EVERYONE'S PROBLEM AND NO ONE'S PROBLEM AND SO BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND HAVING EVERYONE BE RESPONSIVE IS A KEY THING IDENTIFYING WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE IS ALSO REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THE NEXT STEP IS THE HARDEST STEP WHICH IS ACTUALLY. THESE SOLUTIONS NEED TO BE PROPERLY RESOURCE THEY NEED TO BE PROPERLY STRUCTURED MEANING THEY NEED TO HAVE THE PROGRAMMATIC STRUCTURES WITHIN THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE A ROLE OR PART OF THE SOLUTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED CALTRANS FOR EXAMPLE- A CALTRANS WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM PARTICULARLY- DISTRICT SEVEN AND DISTRICT TWELVE. OF CALTRANS AND THEY- THEY CAN WORK REAL HARD ON THEIR ROADSIDE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES BUT THAT'S ONLY DEALING WITH THE THINGS OF THE FIRES THAT THEY MIGHT POTENTIALLY START THEY IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SOLUTION THAT'S BROUGHT THROUGH CALTRANS IT NEEDS TO BE BOTH PROPERLY RESOURCE BUT IT NEEDS TO BE PROPERLY STRUCTURED WITHIN THAT AGENCY IN ORDER TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO- NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE REAL TOUGH PART WHICH IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET BOTH THE FUNDING AND POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO. IMPLEMENT IGNITION PREVENTION STRUCTURE RESILIENCE AND STRATEGIC FUEL MODIFICATION ZONES. GREAT THANK YOU LET US KNOW WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING TO COME FROM- ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BUSINESS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU AM I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION IT WAS VERY VERY HELPFUL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- I HAVE A I GUESS A QUESTION OBSERVATION AND- YOU KNOW. IT SEEMS TO ME AND MAYBE I'M WRONG THAT THERE ARE- AS MUCH AS THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT- SOURCES OF IGNITION. THAT ROAD CREWS OR CREWS WORKING IN HIGH FIRE BRUSH LANDSCAPING CREWS ECCENTRICITY MIKE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A FAIR AMOUNT OF IGNITIONS. A FEW YEARS AGO. I HAD. SUGGESTED I THINK THE CALTRANS THAT MAYBE WE MANDATE THAT THESE KINDS APPROVAL AT LEAST HAVE TO HAVE A SMALL FIRE EXTINGUISHER WHICH ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE. YOU KNOW PURCHASE ANY HOME DEPOT AND I WAS TOLD THAT THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH SOURCES OF IGNITION AND THAT MAYBE. YOU KNOW SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO BUT MAYBE THEY WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO USE THEM BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT. WHETHER THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE USEFUL- YOU KNOW TO SAY YOU KNOW MY- MY HUSBAND'S A LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR AND IT'S SOMETHING HE'S ALWAYS WONDERED BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE SEE THESE GUYS KIND OF WORKING UP IN THE WHOLE SIDES ALL THE TIME. WITH CHAINSAWS FOR INSTANCE IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER. AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW OBVIOUS RISK FOR SOME KIND OF IGNITION AND- IF YOU SEEN ENOUGH OF THAT THAT YOU THINK THIS IS AN AREA WORTH LOOKING INTO. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND- I WOULD START BY FIRST- AGAIN NOTING THAT. WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY TRYING TO PREVENT EVERY SINGLE IGNITION WERE ONLY TRYING TO PREVENT. THE THAT LITERALLY THE OCCUR. DURING WIND EVENTS THAT WILL BECOME CATASTROPHIC FIRES. SO WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN ROAD SIDES. AND WE HAVE TO DO LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE. AND HAS TO OCCUR SOMETIME. IF IT OCCURS- IN MAY IF IT OCCURS EVEN IN JUNE OR SOMETIMES EVEN JULY WHEN THERE'S NO WINS. THEN IF A FIRE IS STARTED. ARE AT LEAST OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT IN ORANGE COUNTY- IS EXTREMELY WELL RESOURCE TO GET ON THOSE IGNITIONS REALLY QUICKLY AND KEEP THEM FROM BECOMING. MAJOR FIRES. SO IF YOU IF YOU REALIZE THAT. THEN YOU CAN START THINKING ABOUT. SHOULD WE REALLY BE DOING MAINTENANCE ON ROADSIDES DURING WIND EVENTS. PROBABLY NOT. SHOULD WE REALLY BE DOING LANDSCAPING WITH CHAIN SAWS OR METAL BLADED WEED WACKER. DURING WIND EVENTS. PROBABLY NOT. AND SO. THAT IS WHERE YOU CAN FOCUS. THE EFFORT. I KNOW THAT DISTRICT TWELVE IN PARTICULAR- OF CALTRANS HAS. MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. TO THEIR- MAINTENANCE POLICIES AND PRACTICES RECENTLY- TO IMPROVE- OR REDUCE THE- THE CHANCES FOR ROADSIDE IGNITION. AND THEY'VE ALSO WORKED WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY AGAIN IT WAS YOU KNOW. OF THIS PLATFORM OF COAST. AND TO DO SOME TRAINING OF THEIR CREW SAID THAT THEY DO KNOW HOW TO USE A FIRE EXTINGUISHER. WHEN IT'S ISSUED TO THEM. THE TRICKY PART. IS IT ONLY TAKES ONE SPARK. DURING THE WINDOW VENT. TO CAUSE THAT PROBLEM. AND SO WE CAN'T. MAKE A MISTAKE DURING THAT TIME. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAY WELL WE'VE IMPROVED OUR OUR PRACTICES WHEN WE LET DOWN OUR GUARD ONE TIME WE HAD A MAJOR FIRE IN ORANGE COUNTY OVER A DECADE OR SO AGO MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN THAT AND IT WAS SOMEONE WHO LIVED OUT IN THE WILD LAND AREA- AND WAS WELDING. DURING A WIND EVENT JUST DECIDED TO GO OUT AND WELD IN HIS BACKYARD DURING THAT TIME AND HE SPARKED OFF A VERY LARGE FIRE AND IT WAS ONE MISTAKE THAT CAUSED IT. SO AGAIN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT FIRES JUST DIDN'T OCCUR HISTORICALLY IN THE SYSTEM THEIR WORK THE SOURCES OF IGNITIONS THAT THEY HAVE NOW. AND IF WE IF BUT BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THEM- I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL WE CAN'T PREVENT EVERY IGNITION WE DON'T NEED TO PREVENT EVERY NATION WE JUST NEED TO PREVENT THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BECOME. CATASTROPHIC FIRES THANK YOU THAT IS VERY THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING AND I THINK VERY ELIMINATING- THANK YOU. AND ONE OTHER THING I'LL SAY IT'S REALLY JUST AN OBSERVATION SO BASED ON SOMETHING YOU SAID ABOUT THINKING RETHINKING SOME OF THE FIRE BREAKS IN THESE AREAS. BECAUSE WEN YOU REMOVE ALL THE PLANTINGS YOU GET THE NATIVE GRASSES AND IT'S I MEAN THEY'RE THE NON NATIVE GRASSES AND IT'S VERY HARD TO. TO KIND OF. OVERCOME THAT AND TO USE THE NATIVE PLANTS- AS A AS A DIFFERENT KIND OF FIRE BREAK- SOMETHING I'VE OBSERVED ALSO IS EVERY YEAR OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR INSTANCE SENDS OUT. THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE NOTICES AS THEY SHOULD AND PEOPLE TEND TO INTERPRET THAT AS- THAT MEANS I NEED TO GO OUT AND CUT EVERYTHING OFF MY WHOLE SIDE. THROUGH THE CYCLE OF HOMEOWNERS GOING OUT AND HIRING AN EDUCATED CREWS TO CLEAR CUT EVERYTHING OFF THE HILL THE NEXT TIME IT RAINS THE HILL COLLAPSES INTO THE STREET. I. THE VERY LEAST THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO. AFTER THAT. BUT AN AMBER. AND THOSE PEOPLE'S HOMES. SO DOING BETTER EDUCATION ABOUT WHAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE REALLY MEANS ANY IMPORTANT HAPPENED PORTENTS OF HAVING A LIVE PLANT MATERIAL. AND THE APPROPRIATE PLANT MATERIAL WHICH ARE OFTEN NATIVES. IN THESE AREAS. IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE WE SHOULD FOCUS MUCH MORE ON AND PUT A LOT MORE RESOURCES IN. BECAUSE WE'RE SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE OUT. YOU KNOW I KNOWINGLY PEOPLE ARE NOT FOCUSED ENOUGH TO DO THE DEEP DIVE INTO THE RESEARCH INTO IT. SO THEY KIND OF DO WHAT THEY THINK TEY'RE BEING TOLD AND IT'S THE WRONG THING. SO IT'S NOT A QUESTION BUT JUST SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL TRY TO. MAYBE WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND I. YOU MAY NOT HAVE THAT IN MR MULLINS IN YOUR AREA BUT IN MY ARE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS IS A COMMON. KIND OF. MISTAKE THAT. PEOPLE MAKE IT IT'S REALLY. MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES LESS RESILIENT TO FIRES NOT NOT MORE SO AND TO OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS. LIKE LANDSLIDES AND IT'S JUST A- I WAS JUST A PERPETUATING CYCLE OF PEOPLE SEE THEIR NEIGHBORS TO AND THAT'S THEY THINK THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DOING IT AND NO ONE'S REALLY CORRECTING THEM. GIVE MS GARCIA HAS QUESTIONS- YES I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- THE FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT THE EDUCATION OUT RICHARD DOING TO. INDIVIDUALS ARE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CALTRANS. AND THE ROADS AND THINGS THAT WE GET TO THE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SIDE THE CAN YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EDUCATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THESE FIRE PRONE AREAS AROUND NGUYEN EPISODES AND WHAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL THERE. SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO MUCH MY ORGANIZATION DOESN'T DIRECTLY DO EDUCATION WITH INDIVIDUALS BUT THEY'RE ALL OF THE PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS. IN COAST A LOT OF THEM ARE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS THAT DO EDUCATION WITH THEIR RESIDENTS- THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY IN THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS DO A LOT OF. OF EDUCATION AS WELL I THINK THE MAIN THING THAT PEOPLE. HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET RESIDENTS TO REALIZE IS THAT WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT. THE EMERGENCY STARTING WHEN THE FIRE BREAKS OUT. BUT IN FACT THE EMERGENCY IS ACTUALLY WHEN THE WIND STARTS BLOWING BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE RISK. BECOMES UP IRRETRIEVABLE IF YOU HAVE AN IGNITION AND SO- FOR EXAMPLE THE- THE CALTRANS AND THE- ORANGE COUNTY- TOLL ROAD AGENCY. USE THEIR SIGNS THEY'RE THERE FOR. THEIR LIGHT UP SIGNS ALONG ROADWAYS DURING RED FLAG WARNINGS TO. EDUCATE MOTORISTS ABOUT THAT- AND THEN THERE OF PROGRAMS LIKE I MENTIONED LIKE READY SET GO. THAT THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY HAS- BUT I DO THINK HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT. THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE EDUCATION BOTH EVENT BASED. MESSAGING WHICH ARE DESCRIBED AS THERE'S A THERE'S A WIND COMING- AND LONG TERM MESSAGING WHICH IS. HOW DO YOU HARDEN YOUR HOME HOW DO YOU- YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T DO THINGS THAT. ENCOURAGE A FIRE HOW DO WE AS A COMMUNITY REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE SO THERE'S A LOT MORE TO BE DONE IN THE EDUCATION REALM. THANK YOU AND THEN I KNOW THAT HE LEFT US WITH. THE LINGERING LEFT UP WITH FIGURING OUT HOW TO FIND THE WORK IN THE PLANNING THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING I DO THIS COAST. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF. HOW THEY NEEDS TO BE DONE OR HOW THAT WILL BE DONE. IN THE LEAD TO PRESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IT AT LEAST IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THAT- LOT OF THE COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY CONTRACT COUNTIES TO CALIFORNICA FIRE. DOESN'T ACTUALLY OPERATE IN IN ORANGE COUNTY THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY IS THE CONTRACT OF THE ALREADY AND I KNOW THE SAME IN LA. I BELIEVE IN TORRANCE SANTA BARBARA THEY'RE ONLY SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES IN- IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW MORAN IS ONE OF THEM BUT MOST OF THEM HAPPEN TO BE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK ACTUALLY THE- PART OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS THAT THE ENTIRE WILD FIRE APPARATUS IF YOU WILL- HAS BEEN BUILT AROUND THIS IDEA OF FOREST FIRES AND CONVENTIONAL- APPROACHES TO. BOTH FIRE MANAGEMENT AND FIRE PREVENTION AND A LOT OF THE WORK IS BEING DONE ON THE GROUND. AND SO- FUNDING LOCAL AUTHORITIES LIKE THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY TO DO FIRE PREVENTION WORK THAT IS THE RESULT OF COLLABORATIVE. DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE WOULD BE ONE WAY TO DO IT I THINK THE SOLUTIONS ARE OUR LOCAL AND THEIR REGIONAL THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY STATEWDE. TO BE REAL HONEST I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HOW THE BUDGET WORKS TO BE ABLE TO SUGGEST SOME SPECIFIC. FUNDING SOURCES BUT I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING- AND THE PREVIOUS. SPEAKER MENTIONED IT IS THAT THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF VALUE IN DOING FIRE PREVENTION PARTICULARLY IN THE WIND. DRIVEN SYSTEMS- WHERE- YOU CAN PREVENT A FIRE THAT MAY COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SUPPRESS WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY WRITTEN A BLANK CHECK. FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION IN CATASTROPHIC FIRES AS WE PROBABLY SHOULD I'M NOT ARGUING WITH THAT BUT WE HAVEN'T INVESTED THE VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF HIGHLY LEVERAGE FUNDING IN FIRE PREVENTION TO PREVENT THAT AND IN THIS CASE I WOULD SAY THAT IT AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH. PROBABLY A TON OF CARE IN THIS IN THIS CASE. THE THREAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR JUST FOR THE DEBIT OF THE QUESTION. BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THIS WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. AND I ALSO THINK THE PRIOR SPEAKER AND I WANT TO ASK YOU ALSO. IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WIND. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE CANNOT CONTROL. SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PREVENTION AND THE PLANNING JUST AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED HERE. WHAT ZONING OR PLANNING PULP POLICIES DO YOU FEEL WOULD BE HELPFUL. IF A STAKEHOLDERS COMMITTEE IS PUT TOGETHER WHO ARE THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO SHOULD BE PART OF THAT AND AS I MENTIONED IN THE PRIOR WITH THE PRIOR SPEAKER SHOULD THIS BE A FIVE YEAR PLAN A TEN YEAR PLAN WE NEED SOLUTIONS TODAY BUT WE ALSO NEED TO PLAN. FOR THE FUTURE. SO WHAT WHAT WOULD WHAT WHAT WE THINK YOU I'M GLAD YOU ASKED ME THAT BECAUSE I WAS. I WAS WANTING TO ANSWER IT EARLIER. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS WITH REGARD TO CLIMATE CHANGE THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE BEING SORT OF THE PROBLEM AND BEING THE DRIVER OF A LOT OF THIS IT TURNS OUT THAT- AT LEAST WITH REGARD TO WIND DRIVEN FIRES IT'S THE WIND THAT WILL ALWAYS BE THE PROBLEM CLIMATE CHANGE MAY MAKE IT WORSE IT MAY MAKE IT RATHER THAN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR DAYS A YEAR OF WINDOWS VENTS IT MAY MAKE IT TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX DAYS OF WIND OFFENSE THEY MIGHT BE STRONGER WE DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WITH REGARD TO THE SOLUTIONS THEY STILL REMAIN THE SAME. WHETHER YOU'RE PREVENTING IGNITIONS EIGHTEEN DAYS A YEAR OR THIRTY DAYS A YEAR IT'S STILL ABOUT PREVENTING IGNITIONS AND SO THAT IS WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND ONE OF THE REASONS I HAVE SOME HOPE IS THAT UNLIKE A LOT OF OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS HURRICANES EARTHQUAKES TO NAME A COUPLE- THIS IS A PREVENTABLE PROBLEM IF WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT AND IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND SO I THINK THE WHAT YOU MENTIONED STAKEHOLDERS I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE A ARE ARE RESPONSIVE TO THIS AND SHARE SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRE PROBLEM AND WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED. ON THE FIRE PREVENTION PART OF THAT WITH REGARD TO PLANNING ALL I'LL JUST SAY THIS ABOUT THAT WHICH IS- I DO THINK WE NEED TO STOP BUILDING IN AREAS THAT ARE HIGHLY FIRE PRONE THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO PUT NEW COMMUNITIES OUT IN AREAS EVEN IF THEIR FIRE HARDENED IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO DO THAT BUT EVEN IF WE NEVER BUILT ANOTHER HOUSE OUT IN THE IN THE FUTURE IN THE FIRE PRONE WILDLANDS THE RECENT ESTIMATE OF THE HOUSES THAT ARE VULNERABLE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AS WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND AMBER CAST AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WENT FROM. JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES TO ALL OVER THREE MILLION HOMES. NOTHING CHANGED OTHER THAN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE RISK WAS AND SO WE HAVE A HUGE HUGE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT ARE ALREADY AT RISK. EVEN IF WE DON'T DO ANYMORE BUILDING IN THE WILDLANDS WHICH I DON'T THINK W SHOULD DO. SO WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY THERE. AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY THE FIRE FRONT WHICH IS PEOPLE'S TRADITIONAL CONCEPTION OF- IF WE STOP THE FIRE FRONT THEN WE'LL STOP THE PROBLEM. NO IN FACT WHEN YOUR- FIRE IS THROWING EMBERS AND BRANDS FIVE MILES DOWN WIND AND LIGHTING HOMES ON FIRE. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A TEN LANE FREEWAY. THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT IS REALLY HUGE AND I THINK WE DO HAVE THE RIGHT STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE FOR THAT. I JUST I WANTED TO FIND ME- MISTER CHAIR. I WANT ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE IS THAT THE WITH YOUR- GROUP SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPORTANT IS THAT THERE IS NO FINGER POINTING IN THE YOUNG THAT WE JUST WANT TO FIND SOLUTIONS IT ISN'T TO FIND SOMEBODY RESPONSIBLE IT AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP IT'S JUST TO FIND OUT AS A GROUP. TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WHAT ARE THE BEST SOLUTION SO I APPRECIATED THAT AND WANTED YOU TO KNOW THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR- FOR YOUR REMARKS THEY'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND TO AN INFORMATIVE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW. A TO OUR FINAL PRESENTATION- WHICH IS GOING TO COME FROM- A MAN WHO- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS I'VE DEVELOPED A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR A JEEP TOM PORTER OF CAL FIRE I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING- THAT- CHU PORTER'S BACKGROUND IS IN FORESTRY- THAT CAME FIRST IN HIS LIFE AND FIRE FIGHTING- FOLLOWED. TO AFTERWARDS BUT DUTCH REPORTERS GOING TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRE PREVENTION AND HEALTHY FORCE PROGRAMS- AND- AS WELL SPEAK ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY THAT CALIFORNIA- USES FOR ALLOCATING THOSE FUNDS AND THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WERE FUNDED AT ITS- ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT- THE- THE CHIEFS DEPARTMENT. IS YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE AND PERHAPS IN THESE TIMES THAT THE NAME HAS BEEN TRUNCATED TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE AGENCY IS SO MUCH MORE AND ACTUALLY THE REAL NAME IS DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION AND THAT IT'S THAT FORESTRY PEACE. WRIT LARGE- AND THE VARIOUS- A TYPES OF- HABITAT AND TERRAIN WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE THE ARE KEY TO OUR ABILITY TO- DO FIRE PREVENTION WORK BUDGET PORTER. WELL. WELL THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M TAKING OFF MY MASK BECAUSE I AM NOT IN FRONT OF THE ANYBODY BUT SCREEN AND I PROMISE NOT TO TOUCH THE MIKE. AGAIN GOOD MORNING- ARE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SORRY IT. MY NAME IS TOM PORTER I AM- THE STATE FORESTER FOR CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION- AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO HAVE TIME TO SPEAK ABOUT THE TOPIC OF WILDFIRE MITIGATION. IS I'M I'M GONNA GO THROUGH MY NOTES SOME OF THE STATE- PRETTY CONCISE IN A FEW AREAS ALLOW FOR QUESTIONS TO FILL IN SOME OF THE GAPS BECAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE SPECIFIC- NEEDS FOR THIS THAT ARE- A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE OF SOME OF MY NOTES SO- I'D LIKE TO START BY TALKING ABOUT JUST JUST THE FIRE SEASON A TINY BIT. THIS SEASON WHILE WE'RE STILL IN THE IN THE KIND OF- LATTER STAGES OF THE PEAK SEASON- IT'S NOT OVER YET AND- RIGHT NOW WE ARE ALREADY OVER EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WILDFIRES STARTED ACROSS THE STATE IN VARIOUS- TYPE SOUND- PLACES EVERY EVERY PIECE OF THE STATE HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY WILDFIRES THIS YEAR- WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY BURNED. IN THOSE WILDFIRES- FOUR POINT ONE MILLION MORE THAN FOUR POINT ONE MILLION ACRES- THE LRGEST FIRE- IN STATE HISTORY IS STILL BURNING THAT IS THE AUGUST COMPLEX AT WELL OVER A MILLION. ACRES NINE THOUSAND STRUCTURES HAVE HAVE BURNED THIRTY ONE LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST TO THESE WILDFIRES AND RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE SIX OF THE TWENTY LARGEST FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY- THAT OCCURRED JUST SINCE AUGUST FIFTEENTH OF THIS YEAR. THIS REALLY STARTED JUST BEFORE THAT- THAT LIGHTNING HAPPENED- AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WE HAD A COUPLE OF FIRES THAT HAD TAM DEPLOYMENTS- IN- IN- FRESNO COUNTY AND IN. NEAR GILROY. IN SANTA CLARA UNIT. AND THOSE FIRES- IT KIND OF STARTED THINGS OFF. ONCE WE HAVE THE LIGHTNING SEEDS WHICH WAS WELL OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND- STRIKES JUST IN SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND OVER A WEEK PERIOD OF TIME OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND STRIKES- THOSE FIRES- WERE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY TO FRESNO- COUNTY PARTICULARLY ON THE WEST SIDE. ALL THE WAY NORTH INTO- MODOC COUNTY- AND ALL THE WAY UP TO COSTA DEL NORTE COUNTY AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT OREGON AND WASHINGTON- RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT LIGHTNING FROM THAT C. H. THAT'S C. H. R. I. HAS BEEN COMPARED TO- THE BIG BURN UP NINETEEN TEN- AND IN FACT. MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THAT- THAT PARTICULAR- WIND DRIVEN FIRES PREVENT IN THE FORESTED AREAS OF. OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. SO THEN WE HAD LABOR DAY COME ALONG. THAT WEEKEND GAVE US WINDS SO OUR LIGHTNING CAUSED FUEL DRIVEN FIRES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEN STARTED TO THROW INTO WIND DRIVEN FIRES- WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE FAIR FIRE PART OF THE NORTH COMPLEX THAT BURNED INTO- TO- LAKE ORVILLE AREA AND THE OUTSKIRTS OF ORVILLE PROPER WAY AT ONE POINT WE WERE CONCERNED THAT IT WOULD RUN ALL THE WAY INTO THE CITY OF OROVILLE. THANKFULLY A LOT OF WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE PRIOR- AND THEN A VALIANT EFFORT TO- TO- KEEP THAT FIRE FROM CROSSING- AND GETTING DEEP INTO THE CITY AREA- KEPT IT OUT AND THANKFULLY THE WIND STARTED TO LAY DOWN AS WELL. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KIND OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE WERE SEEING AND- YOU'VE HEARD A LOT MORE I'M SURE- AND I HAVE STORIES UPON STORIES AND WE'RE BUILDING- THE- KIND OF THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT HAPPENED- SINCE AUGUST FIFTEENTH- IT WILL INCLUDE WHAT HAPPENS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON AS WELL. AND SO WHAT I WANTED TO COME BACK TO THOUGH IS REALLY- THE IMPORTANCE OF. AND ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION. AND MITIGATION OF THE SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN- IT IS TRULY AN ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH THAT'S NEEDED- THIS YEAR SHOWS ONCE AGAIN. THAT FIRE I CAN AND DOES OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. OF FROM OREGON TO MEXICO FROM THE BEACHES TO THE DESERT. IT CAN BE ANYWHERE ANYTIME- AND IT MAY BE FUELS IT MAY BE- FUELS AND WIND- IT MAY BE TOPOGRAPHY DRIVEN FIRES THAT OCCUR BUT FIRES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE EVERY YEAR AND I THINK SOME OF THE PREVIOUS- SPEAKERS TALKS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO EXPECT IN THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT CERTAIN POPULATIONS IN OUR STATE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRE THREATS. CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS DO LIVE IN WILDLAND INTERMENT INTERMIX AND WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS WE WEEK- AND THOSE AREAS ARE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE- YOU HAVE. LOTS OF VEGETATION TYPES MIXED IN WITH- WITH- DEVELOPMENT- AND THAT IS A RECIPE FOR CONCERN AND WE HAVE METHODS AND- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT CAN HELP US TO REDUCE THOSE THREATS AND CONCERNS ONE OF THOSE IS OF COURSE- DEFENSIBLE SPACE- AS WELL AS HOME HARDENING- AND THEN FUEL REDUCTION PROJECT WORK ON THE PERIMETER TO- HEARTENED COMMUNITIES AGAINST- AMBER CAST. AND THEN THERE FOR A REDUCING THEIR THREAT THE ALSO I MEAN ALSO CITIES ARE NOT- OUT OF THE WOODS EITHER- WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF OAKLAND REDDING SANTA ROSA MANY MORE AND THOSE ARE AREAS THAT OR PRETTY HIGHLY URBANIZED IN MANY AREAS- AND THAT ARE ALSO VERY MUCH VULNERABLE TO THE SAME KIND OF STE- SITUATIONS THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN WE HAVE WILDLAND FIRES- OF ANY TYPE IN ANY SIZE DURING THE WRONG KIND OF. WEATHER CONDITIONS. ADAPTING TO WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA'S DRY MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE REQUIRES. SYSTEMATIC ALL OF THE ABOVE TYPES OF APPROACHES. THIS MEANS THAT WE NEED TO IDENTIFY AND- AND MAP FIRE HAZARD ZONES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE NEED TO PROTECT NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRE THROUGHOUT THE LANDS LANDSCAPE. THROUGH LANDSCAPE SCALE FUEL REDUCTION AND FORESTRY- TYPES OF PROJECTS. WE NEED PLANNING PLANNING AND COMMUNITIES- THAT PLAN FOR RESILIENT- GREEN BELTS AND- AND FUEL REDUCTION AROUND THOSE COMMUNITIES AS A MENTIONS TO REDUCE THAT AMBER CAST AND INTENSITY OF FIRE AS IT COMES CLOSER AND CLOSER TO STRUCTURES. WE NEED TO ENSURE COMMUNITIES HAVE PROPER EVACUATION ROUTES WATER SUPPLIES AND FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED AND IN THOSE COMMUNITIES BOTH SPEAKERS PREVIOUS TO ME TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT. THAT CAN HELP IN THE PREVENTION OF FIRES AS WELL NOT ONLY BE IN THE RESPONSE TO FIRES. THE BUILDING HOMES OUT OF EMBER RESISTANT MATERIALS WHILE MAINTAINING A HUNDRED FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE ZONES- BY REMOVING DEAD AND THE DEAD AND DOWN OVERGROWN VEGETATION IS ALSO CRITICAL TOTALLY AGREE WITH NOT MOVES GAPING- A DEFENSIBLE SPACE AREA. I THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE- IT IS A HEALTHY LANDSCAPE AND DOES- ALLOW FOR NATIVE PLANTS AND FIRE RESILIENT PLANTS TO BE IN THAT MIX. ONE LAST SPARK IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND THERE'S A CAMPAIGN- AND ONE SPARK CAN BE ONE TOO MANY ONE LESS COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CATASTROPHIC SITUATION AND- AND- NOT. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR IT TO UNDERSTAND THAT NO INDIVIDUAL TASK OR PROGRAM IS A SILVER BULLET. I BELIEVE I BELIEVE FOR THE PREVIOUS- SPEAKERS ALSO TALKED TO THIS- THIS IS NOT AN EASY PROBLEM TO FIX. AND EACH OF THESE EFFORTS WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER TO PREVENT AND PROTECT AGAINST WILDFIRES. EACH WITH EACH. IT REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT MUST BE ADAPTED TO THE USED IN A PARTICULAR SETTING- AND WEATHER PATTERNS VEGETATION TYPES TOPOGRAPHY AND IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT WHAT THIS MEANS IS- WE NEED TO DO AS PRACTITIONERS- WE NEED TO HAVE ALL OF THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX AVAILABLE TO US TO TUNE THE ABILITY. TO IN THAT OVERTIME IN SOME CASES THAT WILL BE MORE EFFORT AND HOME HARDENING AND LESS IN FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT- IN OTHER AREAS IT WILL BE OPPOSITE OF THAT OF BASED ON BUILDING CONSTRUCTION THAT ALREADY IS IN PLACE BUT BASED ON WHAT THE VEGETATION TYPES ARE THAT ARE IN THE- NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THAT SURROUNDS. WELL IT'S TRUE THAT FIRES CAN BE DRIVEN. BY STATE BY CERTAIN FEATURES LIKE% TO RAIN WIND FUELS- OUR BEST STRATEGY IS TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC. TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES TO USE EVERY APPROPRIATE TOOL- EIGHT TO THE ADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE- AND THAT INCLUDES MAINTENANCE A ONCE WE HAVE THAT SYSTEM OF- PROTECTION IN PLACE. FIRES RE DYNAMIC HI I JUST FOR A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES- IN A- THEY CAN BE. DOMINATED BY WIND AT ONE POINT ONE POINT AND THEN BY FUELS AT ANOTHER POINT- THEY CAN BE START OUT AS FUELS FIRES THEY COULD START OUT A SMALL GRASS FIRES- THEY COULD TURN INTO WIND DRIVEN FIRES OR REMAIN FUELS FIRES OR IN SOME CASES- ACTUALLY BECOME CLING DOMINATED FIRES WERE STARTING TO SEE THAT. OFTEN THE NOT WHERE A FUEL ST FIRE. THE AGENT OWN WEATHER AND WE AND THEN IT BECOMES A WIN DRIVEN FIRE ONLY TO THE FOLLOW MORNING MANY MANY TURNED BACK INTO A FUEL FOR. SO THERE IS NO SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS- AN EXAMPLE OF A- DOMINATED FIRE- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE CREEK FIRE I'M SORRY NOT TO CREDITS TO RECENT THE CAMPFIRE. AGAIN NOW. IT WAS A CAMPFIRE CAN'T ENDS IN. SAN DIEGO THAT I HAD A PLUME DOMINATED EPISODE THAT PUT UP A PYROTECHNIC BUBBLE THAT FLOATED ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES BEFORE IT- DISSIPATED- THAT WAS- IN A CHAPARRAL. DOMINATED ECOSYSTEM WE FIRES IN IT IN KIND OF THE HOPE WOULD LEAD. GRASS INTERMIX CHAPARRAL SYSTEM- JUST RECENTLY- ASK THE- S. U. COMPLEX- HENRICO STATE PARK ALMOST THE ENTIRE STATE PARK BURNED UP IN THAT. EVENT I'M GONNA SAY THAT OUT THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD FIRE THAT OCCURRED ON THEIR- THE TRAGIC THING IS THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY STRUCTURES THAT WERE DESTROYED- IN IN THAT EVENT AS WELL. BUT IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF- CHAPARRAL- FIRE BURNING IN NON WIND CONDITIONS- TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES AND YES THERE WAS GRASS IN THE MIX THERE WAS OAK WITH AND I LITTLE BIT OF CONNOR FOR HERE AND THERE- BUT A LOT OF THAT FIRE WAS IN FACT. CHAPARRAL TYPE- COASTAL AND. HARD CHAPARRAL TYPE. FUELS BUYERS BY WIND THIS HAPPENS- IN A IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. A ALSO HOW IN CALIFORNIA THIS AND IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHEN THE FIRE STARTS- WINDOW CAN BE SOMETHING THAT HELPS WITH THE IGNITION OF A FIRE IN THE EVENT OF POWER SUPPLY SPARKING DUE TO HIGH WINDS SLAPPING THE LINES TOGETHER OR- BREAKING THE LINES- BUT IT ALSO CAN CAUSE- IN IN OTHER CASES- A CONDITION OF OTHER TYPES- A LOT OF LIBERAL ELECTRICAL- SOME OF THEM ARE ARSON- BUT MANY ARE JUST PEOPLE DOING WHAT THEY THINK IS A GOOD THING OR NOT THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT. THERE'S AN EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY- THAT SPARKS OF FIRE AND THEN THE WIND CARRIES IT FASTER THAN THEY CAN DO THAT THEN THEY CAN PUT IT OUT RIGHT NEAR THERE- THEM CHAU EVERY AN EXAMPLE OF A FIRE THAT I WANTED TO BRING UP WAS THE CRANSTON FIRE IN. IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY- THAT FIRE BURNED UP SLOPE AND WITH THE WIND TO- IDYLLWILD AND AS IT. ENCROACHED UPON IDYLLWILD IT IMPACTED A FUEL BREAK THAT HAD BEEN PUT IN THE CHAPARRAL AROUND THE- THE FRENCH OF IDYLLWILD AT THE KIND OF CHANGES THE TRANS. FROM FROM- CHAPARRAL INTO- KIND OF SCATTERED- PINE TREES AND- MORE IF MANZANITA TYPE. OF THAT FIRE GLANCED OFF OF THAT AND WAS WAS ABLE TO BE HELD ON THE EDGE OF THAT WITH MINIMAL STRUCTURE LOST. AND OUT OF A SHOOT THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE FIRE DIRECTLY IN THE IDYLLWILD AND TAKEN OUT THE CENTER OF TOWN- THAT IS THAT IS ONE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE VERY MUCH VERY RECENTLY. USED A FUEL BREAK THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS- AND MAINTAINED- AND IT SAVES THE TOWN OF IDYLLWILD. THE THOMAS FIRES ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF- WHERE FUEL REDUCTION- BOTH IN- FIRES THAT HAD OCCURRED PREVIOUSLY BUT ALSO BURNS AND FUEL REDUCTION WORK THAT HAD BEEN DONE BY- A VENTURA COUNTY FIRE- AND EVEN INTO SANTA BARBARA- THE THOMAS FIRE DID REDUCE IN INTENSITY AND- WAS- RENDERED- CONTROLLABLE IN AREAS PARTICULARLY ON THE FLANKS AND THE HEEL OF THE FIRE THAT'S THAT. THAT'S THE RIGHT SIDE LEFT SIDE AND THE BACK OF THE FIRE AS A AS A FIRE IS RUNNING WITH THE WIND AWAY FROM YOU. AND JUST FOR PERSPECTIVE- OFTENTIMES VERY MUCH IN THE FIRST PHASE OF A WILDFIRE UNDER WINDY CONDITIONS ABOUT 90% OF THE FIRE PERIMETER IS ACTUALLY VERY MUCH AFFECTED BY FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS- AND BY REDUCED FUELS WHETHER IT'S OUR PREVIOUS WILDFIRE. A ROAD- EIGHTY- TRAIL AND SOME CASES THOSE THAT 90% OF THE FILE FIRE DOES HAVE- IT DOES ACT REACT. POSITIVELY MEANING IT'S REDUCED OR IT STOPS- BECAUSE THE WINDS BLOWING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT WIND DRIVEN PORTION OF THE FIRE IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTEND WITH AND THAT'S WHERE WE DEFINITELY NEED A WHOLE SYSTEM. OF REDUCING AMBER CAST- REDUCING INTENSITY OF FIRE AS IT COMES INTO A COMMUNITY HAVING A NON CONDUCT NON- IMMEDIATELY COMBUSTIBLE- IT'S URIEL IN AND AROUND THE STRUCTURE AREA AND THEN A HARDENED HOME ONCE WE HAVE THAT SYSTEM IN PLACE- THEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. USE THESE OTHER. FEATURES TO HERC FIRES A- AT THROUGH COMMUNITY IN AND THAT IN A MATTER THAT THAT WILL BE- PUT US IN A PLACE WHERE WE'RE LIVING WITH WILDFIRE AS OPPOSED TO LIVING AGAINST WILDFIRE. SO ALL OF THE ABOVE- IN SOME OF THE NOTES THAT- DR JENSEN- PROVIDED FROM NEED TO THINK PLAN SOCIETY- YOU TALKED ABOUT- HAVING ALL OF THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX AVAILABLE- FOR- THE PLAN COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT- ALSO I BELIEVE FOR THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND FUEL REDUCTION. MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD AND I. WANT TO STOP SHORT OF TRYING TO BRING THIS TO A ONE OR TWO OPTIONS- THIS IS THIS ISN'T. A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM IT MOTHER NATURE ON ITS SIDE- WE THE ONLY THING THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IS DEVELOP SYSTEMATIC APPROACHES THAT BEST HAVE THE CHANCE OF. REDUCING THE THREAT TO OUR COMMUNITIES- THROUGH. AB MARIETTA OPTIONS AND HAVING ALL OF THOSE INGREDIENTS ARE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX A READY TO GO AS WERE- IT DOING COLLABORATIVE PLANNING OF A PROJECT WORK AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE- THE COLLABORATIVE PRINT PLANNING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY- ACTUALLY THE REGIONAL AIR SAFETY TO. FOR THAT WAS MEETING BEFORE I LEFT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I WAS THE CHAIR OF FOR ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND- THAT WAS A BODY THAT SPAWNED INTO THE- COAST. AND MASSED IN THE MOUNTAIN AREAS THAT'S MOUNTAIN AREA SAFETY TASK FORCE AND FAST FOREST AREA SAFETY TASK FORCE- AND SO I'M VERY FAMILIAR AND VERY- APPRECIATIVE OF THOSE- EFFORTS AND THE COLLABORATION THAT GOES INTO- THOSE- TYPES OF PROGRAMS. SO THE- THE FOR THE I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BEFORE COME TO QUESTIONS IS- ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS- AND I KNOW YOU'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH- HOW THE CCI FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED- AND- THANK YOU L. A. O. FOR THAT ANALYSIS THAT WAS HELPFUL TO HEAR THIS MORNING- THE WE HAVE BASICALLY THREE PLACES THAT THOSE FUNDS- KIND OF. CIPHERIN INTO AND THEIR FIRE PREVENTION RANT AND FUELS WORK TYPE OF- PROJECTS AS WELL AS FOREST MANAGEMENT FOREST HEALTH MANAGEMENT. AND THEN THE- PIECES AND PARTS OF THE- SB NINE OH ONE AND THAT KIND OF HOLISTIC APPROACH TO- REDUCING- FIRE THREAT BUT ALSO INCREASING FOREST HEALTH. AND SO ALL OF THESE EFFORTSARE USED IN IN CONJUNCTION IN THAT ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH WE'VE GOT THAT DEEP WILDLAND ALL CALL IT WE'VE GOT THE INTERMIX AREAS WE'VE GOT THE FIRE DEFENSE- IMPROVEMENT AREAS AND THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND THEN WE NEED THAT FINAL PIECE THE HOME HARDENING REALLY- OF ARMOR THIS ENTIRE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO LIVING WITH WILDFIRE. AND SO PREVENT- THE PREVENTION PIECE IS REALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO WE REDUCE THAT THAT- THREAT OF FIRE IN AND AROUND THE COMMUNITY ITSELF. IN SOME CASES AROUND THE HOME. BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY THE HOMEOWNERS OF RESPONSIBILITY SO WE DO HAVE- PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THOSE THAT ARE VULNERABLE THOSE THAT NEED IT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE CAN'T DO THE WORK THEMSELVES- AND ARE GRANT PROGRAMS ADDRESS THAT- OUR FOREST MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS- FORCED HEALTH. ARE TYPICALLY POINTED OUT LARGER LANDSCAPE LEVEL TREATMENTS AND INCREASING THE HEALTH OF FORESTS- EIGHT WHILE REDUCING THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES TEARING THROUGH THOSE FORESTS AND BEING- TURNED INTO SMOKE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA NOW HAS IN THEIR LUNGS THAT IS THE INTENT THERE. THE COMBINATION OF THESE PROGRAMS GIVES GRANT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND- WE HAVE GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN- UTILIZED FOR THESE PROCESSES FOR THESE PROGRAMS IN FORTY FOUR OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- AND WE LOOK TO INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS- IT IS NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THAT IF YOU GET A PRIOR EIGHT EIGHT GRANT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE NEXT ANOTHER GRANT THE NEXT TIME. WE'RE LOOKING TO GOOD PRODUCT PROJECTS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE THAT HAVE CO BENEFITS- INCLUDING WATER QUALITY INTERESTS- REDUCING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE OF COURSE BUT HABITAT PROTECTION- ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES- WE HAVE- IT SPECIFICALLY. FUNDED FOUR PROJECTS THAT- TO THE TUNE OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN. WE'RE GONNA FOR US YEAR AND KNOW IS A BIG ISSUE FOR US WE DON'T HAVE THE FOREST AND FUELS WORKERS THAT WE NEED TO. DO THE WORK THAT NEED TO DO WHEN WE HAVE- INCREASE IN FUNDING AND SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO HELP WITH THAT AND HOW WE ARE WORKING WITH. OUR NATIVE- CALIFORNIANS ARE CALL THEM BUT THEY'RE NOT SO MUCH THERE THERE. THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHO HAVE TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE TAPPING INTO AND FINDING THEM FOR SOME OF THEIR- WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO AND WANT TO DO TO INCREASE- MANAGEMENT OF THE LANDSCAPE- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THERE IS THERE IS I WANT TO GIVE YO I'M GONNA I'M GONNA COME TO THAT WHOLE THING. WE ARE. MANAGING A SYSTEM AND EMBARKING ON DECADES OF WORK THAT NEED TO BE DONE UNDER THIS SYSTEM AND PROBABLY SOME TWEAKS THAT NEED TO BE DONE AS WELL BUT ONE ONE POINT OF INTEREST- WE DO HAVE A CLAIMANT GOAL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MEET WITH THESE DOLLARS- THE CLIMATE INVESTMENT PROGRAMME FUNDS. AND A FOREST MANAGEMENT IS THIS IS THIS VERY PROGRAM I'M TALKING ABOUT FOREST HILL HORST MANAGEMENT FOR NOT EVER FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THAT WAS THE SECONDS- MOST- IMPORTANT. WORKSHOES QUESTER OR- STORE CARBON OF ALL OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE AT WORK WERE UNDERTAKEN IN ALL OF THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THAT- SECOND ONLY TO- CLIMATES- CLIMATE SMART% AGRICULTURE. AND SO THIS REALLY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN ALL OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND YOU'VE BEEN HEARING TODAY. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO- LOOK AT THE VALUE THAT WE'RE GAINING AND YES THIS IS A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE WILDFIRE SEASON- BUT IT IS- THIS IS THIS DEPARTMENT IS UNIQUELY PLACED AND HAS IS UNIQUELY STAFF. TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE ALL ASPECTS OF IT- OF ITS- TOOLBOX TO INCREASE FOREST HEALTH FIRE PREVENTION- RUN GIGI R. F. PROGRAMS- WE ARE ALSO RUNNING OUR NORMAL REGULAR- RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS DEMONSTRATION FOR US URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAMS REFORESTATION- NURSERIES PROGRAMS. FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND FIRE AND LIFE- IT'S ENGINEERING- PROGRAMS- AS WELL AND SO THOSE ARE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ARE- WORKING TOGETHER UNDER- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION- TO DEVELOP THIS HOLISTIC APPROACH- WITH A DECADES LONG VIEW. AND A- A- PICTURE OF THE AND HOW YEARS THAT IS- CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH WILDFIRE- I DO HAVE WITH ME- IN CASE THERE ARE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- AT ANCELOTTI'S- ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CLIMATE AND INJURY IN ENERGY AS WELL AS DANIEL BURLAP. ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF- WILDFIRE PLANNING AND ENGINEERING AND FIRE ENGINEERING INVESTIGATION- SHOULD THOSE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ANSWERED- WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE SORRY THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHIEF PORTER- I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU'VE BEEN OVER THE LAST- TWO MONTHS AND- AND I KNOW THAT- THAT. TO BE HERE TODAY HAD TO CHANGE UP YOUR SCHEDULE A LITTLE BIT AND I JUST WANT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR PROVIDING THE INSIGHT THAT REALLY ONLY YOU CAN PROVIDE TO THE FOREST SO KNOW THAT IT'S APPRECIATED TO I KNOW WHAT MISTER MULLIN HAS A- HAS A QUESTION. I THINK WE SHARE NOW JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE- NOTE OF THANKS AND APPRECIATION TO THE DIRECTOR OF FOR YOUR GOOD WORK AND AN EXTRAORDINARY. TIME THAT WE'RE ALL LIVING THROUGH. IN CALIFORNIA AND I APPRECIATE THE CALL FOR AN ALL% OF THE ABOVE STRATEGY AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE DELINEATION OF THE PANOPLY OF PROGRAMS THAT- ARE UNDER YOUR- BRAWL I JUST HAVE A FAIRLY BROAD QUESTION ACTUALLY AND- LOOKING FOR YOUR- HONEST OPINION HERE THERE'VE BEEN SOME UP FAIRLY HIGH PROFILE EXAMPLES WHERE FIRES WERE SPARKED. BY THREE LAMBS ON NATIONAL FOREST LAND I BELIEVE- THE BOBCAT FIRE. IS ONE SO HOW CAN WE- ENSURE STRONGER COLLABORATION BETWEEN UTILITIES AND STATE AGENCIES WHEN IT COMES TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. ON BOTH PUBLIC OR OR STATE LANDS AND PRIVATE LANDS AND SORT OF HOW CAN ALL THAT FIT TOGETHER. ALL ON THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FRONT INSERTED WHERE WHERE CAN WE GO FROM HERE. WELL THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR THAT CONVERSATION OR THAT QUESTION IT'S AND IT IS AN ONGOING EFFORT- THANK CPUC- AND WILDFIRE THREAT REDUCTION PROGRAM THAT THAT- IS BEING BUILT THERE IS PART OF THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION- IT IS IT THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR- AND IT'S STILL FLEDGLING AND JUST STARTING TO- STAND UP IT IS THAT THAT WHOLE- DEPARTMENT IS GONNA MOVE UNDER- THE RESOURCES AGENCY AND BE- SISTER DEPARTMENT TO. CALIFORNIA WE ARE ALREADY WORKING VERY COLLABORATIVELY AND CLOSELY ON THESE- IT THESE TYPES OF ISSUES- AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY- PARTLY THROUGH- REQUIREMENT- DURING BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS WITH PG&amp;E IN PARTICULAR BUT WITH ALL OF THE UTILITIES- ON. KIND OF WHAT WHAT WHAT THE NEXT PIECES ARE. THE UTILITIES HAVE A HUGE PART IN THIS IN THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING A- A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. OUR SYSTEM. AND SO. WE ON THE REGULATORY SIDE ARE LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE WE MAY NEED TO STRENGTHEN OR- CHANGED THOSE REGULATIONS. BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SAFE- AND EFFECTIVE SYSTEM AND SO WHAT- WE DO HAVE A LOT OF RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE- IF THEY- ACT OF GOD TYPE OF INCIDENT HAPPENS- THEN ADD AND A UTILITY CAUSES A FIRE BASED ON THAT- THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A NEGLIGENT FIRE. AND THEREFORE- THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE FIRES THAT ARE CAUSED BY UTILITIES THAT ARE NOT- DUE TO- NEGLIGENT OR LACK OF- REGULATED- SPACE- WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT AS A AS AGAIN A HOLISTIC. APPROACH WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE WHAT THE- VEGETATION LOOKS LIKE IN AN UNDER- LINES THAT CAN- POTENTIALLY CAUSE FIRES- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO- INSURE THAT THOSE HARDENING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND HARDENING OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. ARE OCCURRING AND WE ARE DOING THAT- THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MILES AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POINTS OF CONTACT THAT NEED TO BE. LOOKED AT AND MAINTAINED BY THE UTILITIES- THEY ARE WORKING ON THAT- AND WE NEED TO HOLD THEM TO ACCOUNT AND- ADDS TO A MAINTENANCE- LEVEL THAT ENSURES WE DON'T GET TO PLACES LIKE WE WERE WITH THE CAMPFIRE ON THE CARIBOU- DISTRIBUTION LINE- THAT OCCURRED. NEAR PARADISE. WELL IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE WE'VE HEARD OF MISTREATMENT AND THEN THE ADDRESS SORRY. I CHIEF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY SO IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AYE DEEP APPRECIATION FOR YOUR WORK IN THE WORK OF YOUR ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF YOUR AGENCIES SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY. RIGHT NOW SO- THE- FIRST IS WHAT I DID TO JUST VERIFY THAT. CALIFORNIA'S FIRE BRADFORD- PREVENTION PROGRAMS. ARE NOT CURRENTLY BE FUND BEING FUNDED RIGHT NOW AND I'M WONDERING. IN YOUR ESTIMATION. WHAT WE'RE MISSING. BY NOT FUNDING THEM WHAT IS WHAT IS NOT HAPPENING NOW THAT'S PUTTING US IN A MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION BECAUSE WE'VE CHOSEN TO NOT FIND. PREVENTION THAT'S. THANK YOU MEMBER FRIEDMAN THAT THAT THAT IS- IT'S AN OPEN ITEM- I BELIEVE THAT- THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT- THAT BUDGET ITEM- THE ONLY PIECE OUT OF THE- THE FUNDING THAT THAT- DID OCCUR FOR THIS YEAR- I THINK L. A. MENTIONED THIS MORNING IS THE PIECE THAT THAT COVERED THAT- THAT SHIFT OF FUNDS THAT WAS REQUIRED AFTER THE FIRE PREVENTION OR S. ALREADY FEE WENT AWAY SO WHERE WE ARE IS FOR THE GRANTS AS YOU JUST MENTIONED- THOSE ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED- HOWEVER THAT'S NOT- THE END OF THE STORY- WEDO EXPECTS TO- HERE THAT EITHER THERE'S A COURT MARTIAL- OUT OF THAT FUNDING THAT COMES TO US- FOR THOSE GRANT PROGRAMS- OR HOPEFULLY- THAT AMOUNT IN FULL- SO- IF THE- BOOK IS OPEN ON THAT- WE'RE HOPING FOR. FUNDING THANK YOU HAVE HI CONCUR WITH YOUR HOPE FOR THAT. BUT SECONDLY IN TERMS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS VERY DIFFERENT- FIRE- PROGRAMS THEN THE FORESTED HEAVILY FORESTED AREAS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHAT ARE THE KIND OF PROJECTS THAT GROUPS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN SUBMITTING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO UTILIZE CAL FIBERS LOCALIST SISTANCE. AND HEALTHY FAR AS GRANT PROGRAM. THAT IS AN ABSOLUTELY GREAT QUESTION AND WITH SHORT TIME- I AM GOING TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON MORE SPECIFICS BUT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU- THE ANSWER- THAT WE WILL WORK SPECIFICALLY WITH COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- COLLABORATIVELY TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN TAILOR- THEIR PROJECTS TO FIT ONE OF THE PROGRAMS OR VICE VERSA DEPENDING ON. ON WHERE THOSE THOSE SSUES MIGHT BE BUT BUT TRULY- THESE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA AND ALL VEGETATION TYPES OF CALIFORNIA WE JUST NEED TO FIND THE RIGHT ONE- AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM- IS- MEETING ALL OF THE SEAQUEST DANDER IT'S- THAT ARE REQUIRED- IN THE PLANNING PHASES AND THEN ALSO- MEETING THE INTENT OF COLLABORATION AND SOME OF THOSE. THOSE MET THOSE- CO BENEFITS THAT I WAS MENTIONING- WE DEFINITELY WOULD WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT THEY MEET- OR HAVE A PARTNER SUCH AS NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY- OR OTHER CONSERVANCIES IN THE AREA INCLUDING THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WHO'S DONE. INCREDIBLE WORK ON THE SANTA ROSA PLATEAU UP ON THE- ORANGE COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY- BOUNDARY WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE- AS WELL AS OTHER FEL REDUCTION TREATMENTS AS WELL FOR RESTORATION OF THE NATURAL HABITAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHIEF. MS REST. THANK YOU CHIEF IT'S BECOME OF ABSOLUTE PLEASURE GETTING TO KNOW THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND I WANT TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN THANKING YOU AND THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK WITH CAL FIRE I'M IN MY AREA CHIEF MONTHS HE'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH AND HAS IN FACT JOIN US FOR TOWN HALL- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY THE FACT THAT DURING THE VERY BUSY SEASON CHIEF MONTHS SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE SOME TIME. TO JOIN US IN THE TOWN HALL TO HELP WITH PREPAREDNESS AYE I AM EVER SO GRATEFUL TO HIM. I JUST. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR USING ONE WORD. AND THAT IS HOPE. I MENTIONED THIS EARLIER THAT WHEN WE- SEE WHAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS DOING SEE WHAT THE WIND IS DOING- WHAT ART UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE UTILITIES ARE DOING. IT THE THINGS THAT ARE- SOME OF THOSE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR CONTROL SOME OF THOSE WE TRY TO REGULATE. BUT KNOWING THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER THERE HAS TO BE A PLAN. NOT JUST FOR THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR BUT A LONG RANGE PLAN THAT INCLUDES ALLOF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND AYE AYE DOUBTS THIS OF THE OTHERS. I WOULD ASK THIS OF YOU ALSO. WHO ARE THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT MUST BE AT THE TABLE TO PUT TOGETHER THE PLAN. THAT TAKES SAYS. TWO OPEN UP A PLACE A PROTECTION TEN YEARS FROM NOW. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AS AS- MMHM THE OTHERS SPEAKERS IT DID AS WELL IT IT IT IS IT IS A BROAD GROUP AND IN MANY CASES- BUT I WOULD SAY AT THE STATE'S AT THE STATE LEVEL- WE TRULY. DO HAVE A COLLABORATION GOING ON IN THESE AREAS- DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE COULDN'T DO- BETTER JOB AND HAVE MORE- INTERACTION- COLLABORATIVELY BUT IT IS THE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE IT IS CAL FIRE- IT IS OUR STATE LAND MANAGERS WHERE- WE ASK THE STATE- ONLY CONTROL THE DECISION MAKING FOR LAND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON 3% OF THE GROUND. BUT ALL OF US WHO ARE ARE IN THAT- HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE WE CAN BE EXAMPLES AS STATE STEWARD STATE LAND STEWARDS- TO- PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM THOSE HAZARDS THAT EXIST ON OUR LAND- BUT ALSO SHOW THEN. THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ADJACENT AND THE LANDOWNERS OF RANCHES AND FOREST LANDS- WHAT TRUE GOOD- MANAGEMENT LOOKS LIKE AND SO THOSE I THIN THERE WE ARE FOUR KIND OF RIGHT NOW GOING FORWARD WE EXPANDED THAT TO- REALLY- RIGHT NOW AND EVEN MORE IN THE FUTURE- BUILD THAT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM SO EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA. NO MATTER IF YOU LIVE IN THE TIMBER LIVE IN THE IN THE CHAPARRAL LIVE AT THE BEACH LIVE IN THE DESERT DOESN'T MATTER YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THIS MATTERS TO YOU. ALL THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE MATTERS TO YOU AND I THINK AFTER THIS IS. IT YOU DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU ACTUALLY EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS CALIFORNIA'S FORESTS IN THEIR LUNGS RIGHT NOW THAT IS STILL. SITTING THERE- ITHINK THAT IT'S SO EASY AND EASY SELL TO GO ALL WAIT. YEAH THAT I DIDN'T SEE I DIDN'T SEE FIRE BUT THAT SMOKE CAME FROM A LONG WAY AND IT IS AFFECTING ME SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT THAT ARE BROAD AND WE NEED TO DO IN THE BROADER SENSE OF LAND MANAGEMENT TALK ABOUT THOSE THAT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW. AND USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE TO EDUCATE THE OF POPULATION AND- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO GO ON AND ON AND ON YES FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS BUT FOR DECADES. TO HAVE A CULTURE A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW- AS I WAS STRANGE TO LOOK AS A FORESTER. THAT NEEDS TO BE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HOW DO WE SET. EVERYTHING UP SO THAT IT'S BETTER A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW. THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THAT'S A GREAT- OPTIMISTIC GUY AND FORWARD THINKING NOTE TO END ON I MISSPOKE EARLIER IN THE MEETING WHEN I SAID I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU ARE- THE REALITY IS I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW BUSY YOU ARE- AND- SO WE- AS AS EVERYONE IS SAID TO ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE CONVERSATIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO A INTO THE- NEXT SESSION IN JANUARY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND LETS US START WITH. THE ONE PERSON WHO'S IN THE RELICS OF ONE PERSON WHO WAS GOING TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MAKE ON BEHALF OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES OF APPRECIATE THE TIME WILL BE VERY BRIEF- FIRST WE DID WANT TO APPLAUD THE STATE IN ITS- LEADERSHIP AND- EFFORTS. IN GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS- HOWEVER WE THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO. GIVE SERIOUS ATTENTION TO LAND AND FOREST MANAGEMENT IN THE STATE. AND WE HAVE THREE MAIN SUGGESTIONS- AT THIS POINT. THE FIRST IS WE THINK THAT WE NEED A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE WHO CAN FIRST DIRECT- AN ORGANIZED PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE. I CALIFORNIA HAS- STATED A POLICY OF TRYING TO- TREAT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. WITH OVER THIRTY THREE MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND IN THE STATE- ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT REALLY IS NOT GOING TO MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. SECOND WE THINK OF THAT WHILE FITTING IS A VERY IMPORTANT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RE INTRODUCE PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND PART OF THAT REQUIRES A PROGRAM OF ESTABLISHING SOME LIMITS ON LIABILITY. ABSENT NEGLIGENCE OF COURSE TO SOME INSURABLE AMOUNT FOR THE LANDOWNER. AND THEN THE THIRD IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT BIOMASS WILL AND HAS TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. IF WE DO I TREAT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT MATERIAL AND ESSENTIALLY YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF. YOU KNOW OPEN PILE BURNS. OR TRANSPORTING IT TO A BIOMASS FACILITY WHICH AT LEAST ACCORDING TO SOME STUDIES SUCH AS THE PLUMAS FAIR BOARD IT RESULTS IN A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION. IN A CAR BEEN IN KNOX IN PARTICULAR MATTER. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH- YOU ARE SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE OF COURSE CHAIRWOMAN FRIEDMAN. IS NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE THE CHAIRMAN OUR BOARD LIKE STALL SAY. WE CAN I HAVE FIVE AT OUR WHEN WE PROPERLY MANAGE OUR FORESTS OR WE CAN HAVE I WHEN MOTHER MADE NATURE DECIDES AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN- COMBAT IN A NUMBER OF YEARS WHICH AS YOU WELL. KNOW HAS RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF DOZENS OF LIVES YEAR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LOSSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU THANK YOU RESEARCHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOMEBODY OUT AND- CAPITOL PARK. WAITING TO SPEAK. WELCOME SIR. YEAH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BRENDAN TO IT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE EXACT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM ALL THIRTY FIVE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS I'M HERE TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF A CONTINUING THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING FOR LOCAL AIR DISTRICT GRANTS FOR INCREASING MONITORING OF PRESCRIBED BURNS ALSO PUBLIC PUBLIC OUTREACH WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR CHANGING PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND OTHER RELATED WORK AS REQUIRED BY S. B. T. SIXTY OTHER PROGRAMS ALREADY HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT DURING THE FIRST YEAR ALONE OF THE PROGRAM THEIR DISTRICTS ARE VERIFIED CLOSE TO THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED PRESCRIBED FIRES OVER A HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND ACRES WERE TREATED WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE INSURANCE THIRTY THREE FIRES WERE MONITORED WITH THE DAMS OR STATIONARY MONITORS USING THE PROTOCOL DEVELOPED BY CARBON CAPCO EXPANDING PER. FIRE WHICH WILL REQUIRE A LOCAL AIR DISTRICT ROLE WILL BE KEY TO MEETING THE GOAL OF TREATING ONE MILLION ACRES OF VEGETATION ANNUALLY. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS IDENTIFIED IN THE RECENTLY SIGNED US FOREST SERVICE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL YOU. WHILE THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS MODEST THE INVESTMENT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY BENEFITS AND COST SAVINGS A PRESCRIBED FIRE HEADS OFF THE SIGNIFICANT CRITERION TOXIC EMISSIONS. ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRES WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES INCINERATION OF PLASTICS PESTICIDES AND OTHER CHEMICALS THAT ARE CONTAINED WITHIN BUILDINGS VEHICLES AND HOMES- WE'VE REACHED OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AND OF COURSE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- REGARDING FUNDING FOR THIS ITEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON BLOOM AND MEMBERS STAND SILVER ENDANGERED HABITATS LEAGUE. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS LOCAL LAND USE EXPANSION OF NEW DEVELOPMENT INTO THE FIRE ZONE IS ONGOING MASSIVE AND RECKLESS STRUCTURES BUILT TWO NEW CODES BURN ANYWAY AND EVACUATION ROUTES ARE GRIDLOCK EVEN BEFORE THE FIRE STARTS. THE LEGISLATURE MUST SUMMON THE COURAGE TO LIMIT. LOCAL DISCRETION FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION IN THE FIRESTONE IT SHOULD DO THIS DIRECTLY. IT COULD DO IT INDIRECTLY IF THE STATE WOULD STOP SUBSIDIZING SO MUCH THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS WHICH ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO AVOID THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR RECKLESS DECISIONS. AND WHY IS THE STATE CONTINUING TO ISSUE SUBSIDIZE FAIR PLAN INSURANCE FOR NEW HOMES IN FIRE ZONES. MY SECOND POINT IS THAT CALIFORNIA MUST BRING ITS VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM IN SHRUBLANDS INTO THE MODERN ERA. ITS VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM WILL SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON ACTIVE ON ACTIVITIES IT METS ARE INEFFECTIVE IN WIND DRIVEN FIRES IT IS THE WIND DRIVEN FIRES THAT CAUSE LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. A SIMPLE STEP IS TO MAKE CAL FIRE FOLLOW EXISTING LAW AND ACTUALLY ENFORCE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE FOUR FOUR EIGHT THREE WHOSE INTENT IS TO STOP TYPE CONVERSION OF CHAPARRAL TO FLAMMABLE WEEDS. THE VTP OF CAL FIRE SHOWS NO INTENTION OF FOLLOWINGSTATE LAW RATHER IT CALLS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES TO BE CRITICALLY INJURED AND CONVERTED TO MORE FLAMMABLE VEGETATION. IF CALIFORNIA WOULD LIMIT TREATMENTS TO TIMES BEYOND THE NORMAL FIRE RETURN INTERVAL WE COULD GET A HANDLE ON THE DAMAGE. BUT CAL FIRE WON'T TALK WITH US. ANOTHER APPROACH IS TO LIMIT FUND EXPENDITURES TO WHERE IT IS EFFECTIVE. DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND STRUCTURES AND FUEL BREAKS ADJACENT TO COMMUNITIES. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONVENE A SCIENTIFIC PANEL ON VEGETATION TREATMENT AND IT SHOULD ENFORCE THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT CALIFORNIA IS BRAZENLY CIRCUMVENTING THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WAITING TO SPEAK. WHO HAS THE ANSWER. OKAY I'M BEING TOLD THAT OTHER NO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OR WAITED TO SPEAK AND SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS HEARING I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK SUSAN CHAN FROM- THE BUDGET- OFFICE ASSEMBLY BUDGET OFFICE WHO IS DONE- JUST AN AMAZING JOB PUTTING THIS ABOUT PROGRAM TOGETHER TODAY SO I THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU SOON.
