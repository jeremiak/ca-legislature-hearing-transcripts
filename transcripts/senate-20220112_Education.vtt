ADDITIONAL- ADDITIONAL WORK THAT

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:20.472
THAT SOME. LOCAL EDUCATION

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.274
AGENCIES MIGHT HAVE TO DO IS

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:24.443
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO USE THE

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.513
STATE ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE FOR IT

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.481
EL CAP SO RIGHT NOW EVERY

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.083
DISTRICT IN THE STATE HAS TO

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.284
WRITE A LOCAL CONTROL

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:34.052
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. BUT THEY

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:36.155
TECHNICALLY DON'T HAVE TO USE

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.356
THE ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE TO DO

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:41.560
THAT ALMOST ALL JUNE- THIS BILL

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.829
BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE THE

INFORMATION IN THAT ELECTRONIC

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:47.032
TEMPLATE TO POPULATE THE

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:50.302
DATABASE- WOULD REQUIRE THE USE

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.538
OF THAT ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE- SO

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:54.940
THAT WOULD BE THE ONE ADDITIONAL

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:56.341
WORKLOAD REQUIREMENT BUT WE

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:59.211
THINK THAT'S RELATIVELY MINIMAL-

00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:01.079
THE TO ALEXA AND HAMPLE TOOL HAS

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:02.948
BEEN DESIGNED. TO MAKE IT AS

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:04.917
EASY AS POSSIBLE TO FILL OUT

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:07.853

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.656
ALMOST ALL DISTRICTS IN THE

00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:11.323
STATE USE THAT. OKAY AND JUST TO

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.525
CLARIFY SIR AT FIFTY IF THE

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:14.393
SCHOOL DISTRICT IS USING

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.928
ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE AND THERE'S

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:21.066
NO ADDITIONAL REPORTING BURDEN.

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:22.334
THAT- IS THAT REQUIRED OF THEM.

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.169
H. BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:25.537

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:30.409
CAPPING AND LOADED UP I MEAN

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:32.244
THERE WILL HAVE TO BE LIKE. A

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:34.379
MECHANISM TO LOADED- SO THERE

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.148
MIGHT BE A BETTER MINIMAL

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:37.950
WORKLOAD ASSOCIATE WITH THAT BUT

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:39.485
IT IT SHOULDN'T BE A DRAMATIC

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.887
INCREASE IN WORKLOAD. OKAY ALL

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.589

00:18:45.023 --> 00:18:46.425
IMPLEMENTATION OBVIOUSLY THIS

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:48.026
BILL ISN'T GONNA SPEAK TO THAT

TRIED DESIGN A WAIT SO WE CAN

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.137
EXTRACT THE DATA WITHOUT

COMING BACK TO US TODAY TO SAY

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:03.879
THAT WE NEED. MORE TEACHERS WHO

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:06.615
ARE TRAINED- TO IDENTIFY MENTAL

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.517

PORTANTINO BRING UP THIS WE'RE

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:15.557
NOT EXPECTING SCHOOL STAFF AND

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:19.828
TEACHERS. TO BECOME MENTAL

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.463
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS- IN FACT WE

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.766
NEED TO WORK TO BE SURE THAT WE

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:25.167
FUND THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.401
PROFESSIONALS UNNECESSARY

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.504
PROVIDE THE CARE FOR. THE

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:30.973
STUDENTS THE CHILDREN. WHO ARE

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:33.041
NOTIFIED BY THE TEACHERS. AND IN

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:35.144
FACT I THINK IN THE LAST BUDGET

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.678
WE BUDGETED UP FOUR BILLION

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.280
DOLLARS FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH-

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:39.948
WOULD BE PERHAPS WE'LL SEE

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.483
WHETHER WE MIGHT NEED TO DO

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:42.551
MORE. BUT WE OF COURSE NEED TO

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:44.086
BUILD UP THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:46.188
WORKFORCE AS WELL. BUT HIS

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.157
CENTER PORTANTINO SAID WE ALSO

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:51.760
NEED TO BE SURE OF THAT- THE

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:52.895
PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES AND

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.062
THAT'S WHERE TEACHERS ARE THERE

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:56.732
ON THE FRONT LINES AND I KNOW

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:57.833
THEY'RE VERY BUSY HAND THEY'RE

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.968
STRESSED. AND PERHAPS EVEN CELLS

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:01.603
COULD USE A MENTAL SUPPORT TO

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:03.372
BECAUSE OF THE STRESS THAT THEY

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:05.073
HAVE. SO WE NEED TO THINK AND

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.742
TALK ABOUT THAT TOO- BUT THAT

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.610
THEY ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:11.513
STUDENTS WHO ARE IN NEED AND- I

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.948
MEAN THIS WAS A PROBLEM BEFORE

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:15.551
COPAYS. IT'S JUST GOTTEN WORSE.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.853
MUCH WORSE WITH CODED. AND I

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.588
WOULD ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:23.192
THAT- SHE DOES A STUDY PUBLISHED

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:25.694
IN PEDIATRICS THAT LOOKED AT-

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:28.363
JUST TO JUST GET A SENSE OF THE

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:31.233
MAGNITUDE- THAT ESTIMATED THAT

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:36.238
AS OF LAST JUNE- WE'VE HAD A

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:37.439
HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND CHILDREN

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:38.774
IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE LOST A

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.576
PARENT OR GRANDPARENT CAREGIVER.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.744
SO JUST TALK ABOUT LOSS IN THAT

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:44.346
AND THAT'S JUST THE SUB SEGMENT.

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:47.482
IN FACT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT- BUT

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:50.085
PROBABLY OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:51.286
THOUSAND. CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOST

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:52.487
A PRIMARY CRE YOU KNOW THE

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:53.722
SIGNIFICANCE CARE GIVER PARENT

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.157
OR GRANDPARENT PRIMARY CARE

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.993
GIVER. AND SO TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.895
MENTAL HEALTH BURDENS- DEAD

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.830
BATTERY REPRESENTS BUT THEN WE

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.565
CAN THINK ABOUT ALL THE OTHER.

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:05.567
CHILDREN AS WELL WHO ARE FACING

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:09.271
WHETHER. IT'S A RELATIVE- THEIR

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.305
SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:12.741
FORTH TO THE TREMENDOUS NEED FOR

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:14.376
THIS BILL WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:16.278
NEED FOR MORE OF OUR SCHOOL

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.947
STAFF. I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:20.515
OUR VICE CHAIRS QUESTION BECAUSE

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:22.417
WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT OUR

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:23.652
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:24.286
SUPPORT. THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.355
THERE IS SPENDING A LOT NOT ONLY

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.222
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EDUCATE OUR

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.124
KIDS BUT IT'S IN PERSON OR

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.592
REMOTELY. BUT ALSO SPENDING OUR

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.060
MONEY ON COPING CONTROLLED WE

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:33.195
SURE SCHOOLS ARE SAFE AND WE

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:35.397
NEED TO HELP THEM OUT THERE BY

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:36.565
PASSING POLICIES TO HELP

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:37.432
TEACHERS SCHOOLS ARE SAFE. AND

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.468
THEN OF COURSE ON TOP OF THAT TO

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:41.436
BE SURE THEY CAN MEET OUR

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:42.170
CHILDREN'S NEEDS. TO DEVELOP

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:43.372
THAT FIVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:45.307
AND OF COURSE ALSO ONE POINT OUT

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:46.008
THAT A CHILD WITH A MENTAL

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:48.043
HEALTH ISSUE THAT'S AN-

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.878
INDEMNIFIED AND UNMANAGED. IS

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:52.447
ALSO THE STUDENT WHO PROBABLY

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:53.015
ISN'T LEARNING VERY WELL IN

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:56.318
SCHOOL ANYWAY. SO IT IS PART OF

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:57.586
THE EDUCATIONAL MISSION I

01:15:57.653 --> 01:16:00.489
BELIEVE OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:02.324
TEACHERS TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:06.261
WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND.

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:08.096
WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THEY ARE

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:09.398
TRAINED TO DO SO WITH THAT- AND-

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:10.399
REALLY APPRECIATE LEADERSHIP

01:16:10.465 --> 01:16:12.501
CENTER PORTANTINO- REALLY

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:13.969
APPRECIATE THAT I DIDN'T

01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:14.836
ACTUALLY HAVE TO PRESENT THE

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.038
BILL BECAUSE HE'S MUCH MORE

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.306
ELOQUENT THAN I AM- BUT

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:18.774
CERTAINLY IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.243
OF THE BILL. AND AND DOES THAT

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:23.312
AND REALLY- HOPE THAT WE CAN

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:25.847
HAVE UNANIMOUS VOTE FOR THIS

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:26.882
BILL COMING OUT OF THIS

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:35.389
SOLUTION TO GIVE SCHOOLS- SOME

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:38.592
CERTAINTY AS THEY PLAN THEIR

01:36:38.659 --> 01:36:39.660

01:37:05.419 --> 01:37:06.287
SOMETHING THAT THE THIS

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.488
COMMITTEE DISCUSSES THE STUDENT

CONTINUE WITH THE FUNDING AS

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:42.423
OTHERWISE BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW

SPRINGBOARD OFF OF. US SENATOR

LEVEL IT WAS PRIOR TO THE

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.374
PANDEMIC. IN THAT WHY SAY THAT

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.142
IS THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS

01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:16.777
BILL WE DON'T TAKE CARE CHARTER

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:19.179
SCHOOLS. AND A LOT OF THE

01:40:19.246 --> 01:40:20.748
DISTRICTS THAT- I REPRESENT. A

01:40:20.814 --> 01:40:22.449
LOT OF THEIR STUDENTS LEFT NOT

01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:24.318
BECAUSE OF. THE PANDEMIC IN

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:25.953
BEING SAFE. BECAUSE OF THE

01:40:26.019 --> 01:40:27.287
POLICIES OF HOW THEY WERE

01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:29.456
CHILDREN ARE BEING TAUGHT. AND I

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:31.091

GOING AND WHY THEY'RE GOING

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.237

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:45.205
WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:46.874

GONNA REALLY BE SOME SCHOOLS

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:50.778

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:51.445
THEIR POLICIES ARE DIFFERENT

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:53.213
ABOUT HOW THEY- TAKE CARE OF

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.249

THEY WERE JUST OPEN AT THE TIME

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:12.553
NOW THAT COULD BE A DIFFERENT

01:43:12.619 --> 01:43:13.854
CASE NOW THAT WAS THAT TWO YEARS

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:15.355

BUT- I DO ALSO APPRECIATE THE-

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:31.371
POINTS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:32.539
ANALYSIS THAT SENATOR PAN SPOKE

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:35.142
TO. AND YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO BE

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:37.811
A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER THESE DAYS

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:39.346
AND THAT NONE OF US HAVE CRYSTAL

01:43:39.413 --> 01:43:42.249
BALLS- BUT I WILL SAY THAT

01:43:42.316 --> 01:43:43.417
BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC EVER

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:44.885
HAPPENED WE HAD SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:46.787
THAT WERE. ON THE BORDER OF

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:48.956
BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE THEY- REFUSED

01:43:49.022 --> 01:43:50.190
TO MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS THAT

01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:52.059
WERE NECESSARY FOR A VARIETY OF

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:53.961
BUDGETARY REASONS. NOT JUST

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:55.729
ABOUT ENROLLMENT HELLO THAT

01:43:55.796 --> 01:43:57.931
CERTAINLY IS A- IS A DOMINANT

01:43:57.998 --> 01:43:59.366
ONE AND THIS COMMITTEE DOESN'T

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:02.402
REALLY GET TO. HEAR THESE TYPES

01:44:02.469 --> 01:44:03.503
OF ISSUES BECAUSE THEY'RE HEARD

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:05.105
IN BUDGET- EVEN OTHER

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:06.373
IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION ARE

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:11.478
ENORMOUS. AND SO. I JUST WANT

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:15.115
TO. PUT A- IN IN THAT POINT

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:16.550
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD ONE-

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:18.785
I WOULD I DO WANT TO ADDRESS THE

01:44:18.852 --> 01:44:20.053
ISSUE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS HERE

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.155
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WE'VE HAD

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:24.658
BATTLES OVER MANY DECADES REALLY

01:44:24.725 --> 01:44:27.127
IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL PUBLIC

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:31.131
SCHOOL SPACE- AND- YOU KNOW A

01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:34.668
PART OF. PEACE IN THE SPACES

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:37.204
EQUITY. THAT THAT THE PEOPLE

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:39.373
THAT THE UNITS THAT THAT THERE'S

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:40.841
FAIRNESS. AND WE HAD SOME PRETTY

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:42.743
TOUGH BILLS A COUPLE YEARS AGO

01:44:42.809 --> 01:44:44.845
THAT USE THAT POINT EXACTLY TO

01:44:44.911 --> 01:44:47.447
BE CONCERNING CRITICAL UP OF THE

01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:50.050
PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEN

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:52.352

01:45:08.835 --> 01:45:10.771
BE A PLACE FOR IN EQUITY TO IT

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:12.806
