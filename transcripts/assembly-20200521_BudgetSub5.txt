OKAY THE MEMBER VISION BUDGET AND KNOWLEDGE IS THE NEW FISCAL REALITY FOR THE STATE. LUCKILY FOR OUR STATE. THE YEARS OF BUILDING A RAINY DAY BUDGET. WILL HELP TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR NEEDS BECAUSE THAT RAINY DAY HAS CERTAINLY COME. EVEN SO THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FORECASTED A FIFTY PLUS MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET HOLE AND NO GUARANTEE OF SUFFICIENT FEDERAL FUNDING. ESOS THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES CUTS TRIGGER CUTS AND AUGMENTATIONS. ARE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL THOROUGHLY REVIEW EACH OF THESE PROPOSED TO ASSESS THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT AND THEIR NECESSITY. IT'S GOING TO BE GONE BECAUSE THE FOCUS IS TRYING TO GIVE AS MUCH TIME TO OF THOSE WHO ARE ON THIS IS THE ONLY HEARING THAT WILL TAKE PLACE FOR THE PUBLIC- FOR THEM TO HAVE INPUT INTO IT WE'RE GOING TO I'M GOING TO RESERVE MIKE- COMMENTS FOR. ANOTHER TIME AS WELL AS TO MAKE COMMENTS AFTER WE HAVE OUR PRESENTATION FROM MY PANELISTS AND ASK QUESTIONS BUT I WILL OPEN IT UP TO ANY MEMBER WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A COMMENT AT THIS TIME WE'RE ASKING THAT YOU LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO THREE MINUTES. DOES ANYONE OKAY MISTER JONES SAWYER WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT. I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THIS HEARING AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THERE MAY TIME TO JOIN US TODAY- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A UNIQUE AND CHALLENGING YEAR FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE. IT HAS BEEN SAID MANY TIMES BUT BEARS REPEATING THE BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ITEMS PROPOSED INTO MAY REVISE THAT I'M PLEASED ABOUT INCLUDING THE PLAN TO EX TO EXPAND A GOOD. CONDUCT CREDIT SYSTEM AND MOVING THE YOUTH OUT OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND INTO COUNTY PROGRAMS. I SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE PLANT TO CAP PAROLE AT TWO YEARS IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE THE DELIVERY OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. HOWEVER I REMAIN CONCERNEDABOUT PROPER IMPLEMENTATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE SURE THAT THIS IS DONE PROPERLY. SIMILARLY WITH THE PROPOSAL TO CLOSE PRESENCE I'M ALL FOR SHRINKING THE SIZE OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BUT I'M INTERESTED TO SEE THE PROPOSED PLAN INCLUDING CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS. FINALLY THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE I WAS NOT A SUPPORTIVE. OF THE MAY REVISED PROPOSALS IN PARTICULAR TO PROPOSAL TO REPORT. FIFTEEN MILLION FROM THE U. HREE INVESTMENT GRANT. AND THE TRIBAL YOUTH REINVESTMENT GRANT BACK INTO THE GENERAL FUND. WAS CONCERNING TO ME. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS THE LEGISLATURE ANY ADMINISTRATION HAVE AGREED THAT FUNDING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR YOUTH. IN LIEU OF INCARCERATION WITH A PRIORITY. IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE TO ME THAT IN A YEAR WHERE WE ARE PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE. STATE INCARCERATION OF YOUTH WOULD ALSO CUT THE VERSION FUNDING. THESE FUNDS KEEP YOUTH OUT OF PRISONS. WHICH REPRESENTS SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS TO THE STATE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. INVEST IN OUR YOUTH WITH HEALTH. EDUCATION CAREER AND OTHER IMPORTANT SERVICES. LAST YEAR TO GRANT FUNDS WERE OVER SERVE SUBSCRIBED WITH MORE APPLICANTS THAN WE HAD MONEY FOR. AND WE EXPECTED. THE SAME WITH THE SAME WILL BE THE CASE THIS YEAR. I STRONGLY SUPPORT A LEGISLATIVE BUDGET. THAT RETURNS THESE CRITICAL FUNDS AND THAT SENTIMENT IS SHARED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROMMEL'S WHO ADVOCATED FOR THE TRIBAL YOUTH FUNDS. HE PLANS TO SUBMIT A LETTER TO THIS COMMITTEE. ON THIS IS ISSUE BUT I WILL READ JUST A PORTION TODAY. A IME WHEN THIS HAS APPROVED THIS MONEY TO START TO DEAL WITH YEARS OF NEGLECT. TO NOW PULL BACK TO FUNDING REPLACED THE MESSAGE OF PAST PRACTICES TOWARD THE NATIVE YOUTH AND INDIAN COMMUNITIES. THE TRIBAL YOUTH DIVERSION PROGRAM IS A KEY INVESTMENT IN OUR YOUTH AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A VITAL PART OF OUR STATE JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMMING. TO REDUCE CURRENT AND FUTURE INCARCERATION AND PROBATION COSTS FOR COUNTIES. ON BEHALF OF MYSELF ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS AND JUSTICE INVOLVE YOU STATE WHY I REQUEST TO FIFTEEN MILLION FOR YOU THREE INVESTMENT GRANTS BE RETURNED TO THE BUDGET. THANK YOU MEANT THAT MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE MRS DON'T. JUST BRIEFLY I DIDN'T KNOW IF NOW IS THE BEST TIME OR AFTER THE PRESENTATION BUT I'LL JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON AREAS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. WITH RESPECT TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH BUDGET I UNDERSTAND THAT THE SIGNIFICANT CUTS THAT ARE THERE AND NOT BUT I LOOK AT THE MODERNIZATION FUNDS AND I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A LONG DESIRE OF THE- CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL BUT I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT GIVEN THE SACRIFICE THAT. WERE MAKING ACROSS THE BOARD THAT PRESERVING SOME OF THOSE MONIES INSTEAD OF HOLDING OFF ON SOME OF THAT MODERNIZATION. AND SPENDING IT ON. ATTACKING ACCESS TO JUSTICE THROUGH LEGAL SERVICES WOULD BE PROBABLY BETTER SERVED AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND THE SECOND COMMENT IS WITH RESPECT TO DJJ WE'VE BEEN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION FOR QUITE SOME TIME ABOUT MOVING AWAY FROM DJJ GIVING MORE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTIES. SO WHAT I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THE PROPOSAL. THAT'S IN THIS BUDGET. AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN BUILT AROUND SAVING SOME MONEY AND THAT'S FINE. BUT AS WE SAID THIS ESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTIES WHICH I AGREE WITH THAT I TRUST OUR PROBATION CHIEFS TO. MANAGE THIS APPROPRIATELY. THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMMING. OPTIONS THAT DJJ HAS HAD THAT I WOULD HATE TO LOSE TO THIS PROCESS AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS I THINK THE STATE NEEDS TO KEEP. INVOLVED WITH WHAT HAPPENS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND WITH DESPERATE RESOURCES AND DISPARATE PUBLIC POLITICAL WILL IN OUR VARIOUS COUNTIES. I WOULD HATE IF WE SET UP A SITUATION WHERE THE SUCCESS OF A KID IF OF A CHILD. IN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM NOW BEING RUN BY THE COUNTIES WOULD DEPEND ON WHICH COUNTY THEIR RED SO THE STATE WILL HAVE A CONTINUING ROLE. IN MANAGING. OUTCOMES FOR KIDS AT THE COUNTY LEVELS AND ENSURING THAT THAT ALL KIDS IN WHATEVER COUNTY THERE IN HAVE ACCESS TO BASIC MINIMUM TYPES OF PROGRAMS. THAT HELP THEM TO NOT RECIDIVIST THAT HELP THEM GET BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THAT WE THAT WE THEN SUPPORT THE VARIOUS. PROBATION DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY IN THAT WAY TO SUPPORT THAT MOVE. BUT WITH A QUESTION AS WITH EVERYTHING THAT DOUBLE WILL BE IN THE DETAILS. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW THAT GETS IMPLEMENTED AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE STILL MAINTAINS AN APPROPRIATE ROLE IN PROTECTING KIDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. EVEN AS WE KEEP THEM LOCALLY WHICH WE KNOW BENEFITS. CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES BY KEEPING THOSE KIDS IS CLOSE TO HOME IS THAT POSSIBLE SO- HEARTENED BY THE PROPOSAL. AND I KNOW IT'S BUDGETARY REALLY DRIVEN. BUT IT'S ALSO GOOD POLICY IF WE MANAGE THAT POLICY APPROPRIATELY THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. OKAY WE WILL NOW GO TO OUR PANELISTS DREW SEIDENBERG FROM THE LA OLD TO PROVIDE US WITH AN OVERVIEW AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- IF THEY FEEL OF SOUL AND WE ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR Q. NA. OKAY. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- JURY SHOULD WORK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING US TO SPEAK TODAY TODAY I WILL BE PRESENTING FROM THIS HAND OUT WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU AND IT PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR PUBLIC SAFETY PROPOSALS. IN THE- TWENTY TWENTY ONE MAY REVISION. IF YOU TURN TO THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT YOU'LL SEE A TABLE DEPICTING THE CHANGE BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY FOR SOME OF THE LARGER DEPARTMENTS THAT WILL BE DISCUSSING TODAY. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES NUMEROUS PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THE FISCAL CRISIS FACING THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE IT INCLUDES PROPOSALS TO REVERT- REQUESTS MADE IN JANUARY AS WELL AS TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE REQUESTS MADE IN JANUARY. THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSES VARIOUS REDUCTIONS IN THE BASELINE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR SOME DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. AS WELL AS LOANS FROM NUMEROUS SPECIAL FUNDS FROM THE DEPARTMENTS WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT TODAY. IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE YOUR HAND OUT YOU'LL SEE AN OVERVIEW OF THE JUST JUDICIAL BRANCH- I WOULD KNOW BEFORE YOU GO INTO THIS PRESENTATION I'VE BEEN ASKED BY YOUR STAFF TO COMPLETE ALL OF A OUR COMMENTS FOR EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS BEFORE HANDING IT OVER- TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THAT WORKS FOR. YOU SO TO BEGIN WITH USUAL BRANCH. ALL MY FIRST THE MAY REVISION REDUCES FUNDING FOR BASE OPERATIONS IT DOES THIS BOTH BY WITHDRAWING A PROPOSED A HUNDRED AND SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION. DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BASED AUGMENTATION THAT WAS PROPOSED IN JANUARY. AND MAKING A REDUCTION OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- AN ON GOING TRIGGER REDUCTIONS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THESE REDUCTIONS- WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO THE TRIAL COURT'S HO WOULD RECEIVE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN REDUCTIONS. TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN REDUCTIONS TO THE STATE COURTS WHICH IN WHICH INCLUDE THE SUPREME COURT. THE COURTS OF APPEALS AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND FIFTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN REDUCTIONS. TO VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SUCH AS DEPENDENCY COUNCIL- GIVEN THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION FACING THE STATE WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THESE HOWEVER. WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENSURE THAT THESE REDUCTIONS REFLECT ITS PRIORITIES. FOR EXAMPLE AT A MINIMUM WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIAL COURT% REDUCTION WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THAT IT BE ALLOCATED BASED ON WORKLOAD TO ENSURE THAT COURTS THAT HAVE. MORE WORK LOAD RELATIVE TO THEIR RESOURCES RECEIVE SMALLER REDUCTIONS SO THAT THE IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC WILL BE LESS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER OTHER MODIFICATIONS SUCH AS REQUIREMENTS THAT REDUCTIONS BE ARE TARGETED SUCH THAT- BASELINE LEVELS OF SERVICE ARE PRESERVED. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF GENERAL FUND BACK FILL PROVIDED TO TRIAL COURTSTO OFFSET THE REDUCTION AND FINES AND FEES SPECIFICALLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A ONE TIME TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BACK FILL THIS IS AN INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION ABOVE THE AMOUNT PROPOSED IN JANUARY. IN ADDITION THE- LONG LANGUAGE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO INCREASE THIS AMOUNT AS NECESSARY- WE RECOMMEND MODIFYING THIS PROPOSED LANGUAGE SO THAT IT PARALLELS THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR. EXPENDITURES THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INFORMED OF ANY REQUESTS RUN AUGMENTATION TO THIS AMOUNT- IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THOSE REQUESTS WERE APPROVED AND PUT THE LEGISLATURE IN A POSITION TO REVIEW THOSE REQUESTS BEFORE THEY ARE APPROVED WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND REQUIRING A QUARTERLY REPORT ON THE AMOUNT OF THE AUGMENTATION PROVIDED. TO THE- TRIAL COURTS IN ORDER TO FURTHER INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROPOSAL. YOU TURN TO YOUR NEXT PAGE. WE'LL ALL GO ON TO DESCRIBE A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND ONE TIME. GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR TRIAL COURT WORKLOAD BACKLOGGED DUE TO COPE WITH NINETEEN- WELL A BACKLOG CERTAINLY EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE STOPS VARIOUS TRIAL COURTS OF TAKEN IN REACTION TO COPE WITH NINETEEN- IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THE SIZE OF THIS BACKLOG AS ACCORDINGLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONLY. APPROVE THIS AFTER RECEIVING INFORMATION ON THE SIZE OF THE BACKLOG AS WELL AS THE FACTS THE FUNDING WOULD HAVE AND HOW IT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN THE TRIAL COURT'S. ON IN ADDITION THE MAIN REVISION- PROVIDES ON GOING FUNDING FOR COURT MODERNIZATION PROJECTS THIS WOULD BE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING THAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL COULD ALLOCATE. TO COURT MODERNIZATION PROJECTS WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE MAI REVISION WITHDRAWS TO JANUARY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROPOSALS THAT TOTAL TO SEVENTEEN POINT TWO MILLION. WE'D RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSED AUGMENTATION AS WE FEEL THAT PROJECTS RATHER THAN BEING SELECTED BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT SHOULD BE PUT THROUGH THE NORMAL BUDGET PROCESS SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN GO THROUGH. THE TYPICAL VETTING PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES AND APPROPRIATE. OF FINELY IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF THE MAY REVISION SUSPENDS NEW COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSED FORTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. TO BEGIN THE DESIGN OF OVER OF ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PURSUED OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO WITHDRAW THAT AMOUNT- HOWEVER WE WOULD KNOW THAT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PROJECTS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE PURSUED. ALL WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE APPROVING THE MAY PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW THESE FUNDS GIVEN THE STATE OF THE GENERAL FUND. IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE IN YOUR HAND OUT PAGE FOUR- WILL GOING TO DISCUSS THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FROM THERE A SERIES OF CHANGES IN THE MAJOR REVISION RELATED TO THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES- TO BEGIN WITH THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A THIRTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND BACK FILL. AGAIN TO ADDRESS THE DECLINE IN FINDING FEE REVENUE THIS TIME THE FINE AND FEES SUPPORTING THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES. IN ADDITION THE MAY REVISION WITHDRAWS TO PROPOSALS THAT WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED BFS THIS INCLUDE SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION FOR EQUIPMENT. AND FACILITY MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS A NINE POINT FIVE MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A NEW FORENSIC LABORATORY IN SACRAMENTO. WE WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING THE BACKFIELD BUT AGAIN WE WOULD MODIFY THE LANGUAGE SO THAT IT PARALLELS ON IN THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ON ANTICIPATED COSTS SIMILAR TO. MY REMARKS WITH RESPECT TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH- WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THE LOCAL AGENCIES THAT USE THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES. BE REQUIRED TO PARTIALLY SUPPORT THE BUREAU BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT DOJ TO BEGIN. THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A PLAN TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. UNDER OUR PROPOSAL THE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THE BUREAU COULD BE REMOVED AND INSTEAD REPLACED WITH SUPPORT FROM THE- LOCAL ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE BFS SERVICES FINALLY WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE OTHER BFS JANUARY PROPOSALS. THE MAY REVISION ALSO MAKES CHANGES TO VARIOUS OTHER DOJ PROPOSALS FOR EXAMPLE IT WITHDRAWS FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL FOR TAX RECOVERY TASK FORCES. AND WITHDRAWS TWO POINT TWO MILLION- THE ENTIRE GENERAL FUND AMOUNT THAT WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED THE HEALTH CARE RIGHTS AND ACCESS SECTION THAT SECTION- WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE SIX POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN SPECIAL FUNDS SUPPORT. AGAIN WE'D RECOMMEND APPROVING THESE PROPOSALS GIVEN THE CONDITION OF THE GENERAL FUND. IN ADDITION THERE ARE VARIOUS LOANS PROPOSED FROM DOJ SPECIAL FUNDS- THEY TOTAL A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING A LOAN FROM THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUND OF EIGHTY MILLION AND A LOAN FROM THE FINGERPRINT FEES ACCOUNT A FIFTY MILLION. TOOK A GOOD THESE BONDS AND BE THAT THEY CAN SYSTEM THESE LAW AND- THAT THESE LOANS BE APPROVED. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT. OF WILL DISCUSS SOME OF THE MAJOR PROPOSALS RELATED THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO BE AN WITH. THE MAY REVISION MAINTAINS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND INCREASE FOR- THE COMMUNITY POWER RESILIENCY FINDING THESE ARE FUNDS THAT ARE USED TO SUPPORT STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER HUT OFFS. BUT WE WOULD RECOMMEND CONSIDERING REDUCING THIS FUNDING GET GIVEN THE CONDITION OF THE GENERAL FUND AND THE LACK OF INFORMATION ON HOW THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED FOR EXAMPLE AT THIS TIME IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MUCH WOULD BE USED BY THE STATE AND HOW MUCH WOULD BE USED BY LOCALS HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES DECIDE TO APPROVE THIS OUT WE WOULD RECOMMEND ADOPTING LANGUAGE. SPECIFYING HOW THE FUNDS COULD BE USED AND REQUIRING- YES TO REPORT ON HOW THE FUNDS ULTIMATELY ARE USED AND WHAT OUTCOMES ARE ACHIEVED WITH NOTE THAT SIMILAR FUNDING WAS APPROVED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND THIS LANGUAGE PART OF THAT FUNDING SO IT'S BEING PER FOR TWO ONE. IN ADDITION THE MAY REVIEW PROPOSES A THIRTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INCREASE FOR THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT- THIS IS TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION MORE THAN PROPOSED IN JANUARY TO REIMBURSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR CERTAIN COSTS THIS IS SO SEATED WITH EMERGENCY RESPONSE- WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT THESE DOLLARS COULD BE USED FOR COVERT NINETEEN RELATED COSTS. WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THESE DOLLARS HOWEVER WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND IMPROVING LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES- YES TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR COVERT NINETEEN PURPOSES. IN ORDER TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE BETTER TRACK EXPENDITURES ON CODE NINETEEN WHICH IS PROVED DIFFICULT AT TIMES. IN ADDITION BE MAY REVISION WITH DRAWS A HUNDRED POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR- YES TO IMPLEMENT THE HOME HARDENING PILOT GRANT PROGRAM THIRTY EIGHT LAST YEAR- WE'D ALSO NOTE THAT THE MAI REVISION. REDUCES THE FUNDING FOR CAL FIRE TO IMPLEMENT THIS BILL AS WELL WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WHETHER REMOVING FUNDING FOR THIS RECENTLY APPROVED BILL IS APPROPRIATE. GIVEN ITS OTHER LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AS WELL AS THE CONDITION OF THE GENERAL FUND WE WOULD NOTE THAT OF THAT A HUNDRED POINT EIGHT MILLION- ONLY TWENTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION OF IT IS GENERAL FUND. IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE THAT WE WILL GO THROUGH- THE FOR THE FINAL- PROPOSALS REALLY TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ON THE MAY REVISION REDUCES FROM TWO POINT FOUR MILLION TO TWO MILLION FUNDING FOR THE WILD FIRE FOR CAST AND THREATEN TELLIGENT INTEGRATION CENTER. WHICH WAS AUTHORIZED BY SB TWO OH NINE LAST YEAR IN ADDITION IT PROPOSES LANGUAGE REQUIRING DO LEFT TO APPROVE A STRATEGY AND SPENDING PLAN PRIOR TO- YES BEING ABLE TO EXPAND FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING THE REDUCTION GIVEN THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION BUT WE WOULD RECOMMEND MODIFYING IT TO REQUIRE- WE US TO NOT ONLY PROVIDE- IT THE STRATEGY AND SPENDING PLAN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT ALSO TO THE LEGISLATURE. VISION ALSO MAINTAINS NINE POINT FOUR MILLION IN DISASTER PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE FUNDING- OF THIS AMOUNT NINE POINT TWO MILLION AS GENERAL FUND THIS- THESE FUNDS ARE SLATED TO BE USED TO SUPPORT. FIFTY POSITIONS THAT WOULD HELP SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT IN VARIOUS AREAS SUCH AS FINANCE ADMINISTRATION AND DISASTER RESPONSE. WE WOULD RECOMMEND CONSIDERING APPROVING THIS FUNDING OLY ON A ONE TIME BASIS WHILE THE DEPARTMENT IS CERTAINLY- EXPERIENCING- HIGH LEVELS OF WORKLOAD RELATED TO CODE NINETEEN AND OTHER DISASTERS IT'S UNCLEAR HOW LONG THIS WORK LOAD WILL EXIST SO BY APPROVING IT ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS THE LEGISLATURE CAN REASSESS. WHETHER THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE OR FURTHER MODIFICATIONS ARE NECESSARY ONCE IT EXPIRES. OF FINELY THE- MAY REVISION REVERTS FUNDING FOR VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATIONS MADE IN RECENT YEARS FOR EXAMPLE IT REVERTS FUNDING- FOR THE INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN PROGRAM- THESE VERSIONS ARE BEING PURSUED- BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE FUNDS THAT WERE ALLOCATED WERE SPENT- WE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT IT'S UNCLEAR IN SOME CASES WHY THESE FUNDS WERE SPENT PARTICULARLY IN CASES WHERE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS WERE PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED. SUCH AS THE INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN PROGRAM. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF THE HAND OUT. YOU'LL SEE- THE PROPOSAL'S RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. THE NAY REVISION PROPOSES VARIOUS POPULATION REDUCTION MEASURES AS WELL AS PRISON CLOSURES SPECIFICALLY IT PROPOSES TO REDUCE RECEPTION CENTER PROCESSING TIME IN ORDER TO GET INMATES INTO THE MAIN LINE PRISONS THEY LIVE THAT FASTER SO THAT THEY CAN BEGAN PARTICIPATING IN PROGRAMS AND EARNING CREDITS EARLIER. WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION IT ALSO PROPOSES TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT CERTAIN INMATES EARN THROUGH GOOD BEHAVIOR TO FURTHER REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION IN TOTAL THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THESE CHANGES WOULD REDUCE THE INMATE POPULATION BY ELEVEN THOUSAND INMATES BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO CLOSE ONE PRISON AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND ANOTHER AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE HOWEVER THE PRISONS THAT WOULD BE CLOSE ARE NOT IDENTIFIED AT THIS TIME. THESE CHANGES WOULD CREATE SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND SAVINGS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL SAVINGS IN FUTURE YEARS ONCE THE PRISONS ARE CLOSED. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE POPULATION REDUCTIONS WHAT OUT LIKELY ALLOW THE FOR THE STATE TO CLOSE MORE THAN JUST TO PRISON SPECIFICALLY DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE PRISONS SELECTED FOR CLOSURE THE STATE COULD CLOSE ONE TWO FIVE ADDITIONAL PRISONS. ON TOP OF THE TO PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NUMBER OF PRISONS THAT COULD BE SLATED FOR CLOSURE WE'D RECOMMEND DIRECTING CDC ARE. TO RANK PRISONS FOR CLOSURE BASED ON CRITERIA SPECIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURE SUCH AS THEIR OPERATING COSTS PER BAD. WE ALSO RECOMMEND NOT APPROVING PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS INTEL SPECIFIC PRISONS FOR CLOSURE ARE IDENTIFIED. THIS WOULD ALSO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE MORE TIME TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE POPULATION CHANGES ON THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT APPROVE- INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AT PRISONS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE CLOSED. THE MAY REVISION ALSO PROPOSES TO REDUCE THE PEARLY POPULATION. ALL IT DOES THIS IN TWO WAYS FIRST IT PROPOSES TO CAP PAROLE TERMS FOR MOST PAROLEES AT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND TO ESTABLISH AND EARNED DISCHARGE PROCESS. THESE CHANGES WOULD REDUCE THE PAROLE POPULATION BY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND AND CREATE TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO OUR- TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AN INCREASE SAVINGS IN FUTURE YEARS- WE KNOW THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD FOCUS RESOURCES ON THE TIME PERIOD IN PAROLE WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE MOST LIKELY TO VIOLATE. AND INCREASE PAROLEES CENTER OF TO ADHERE TO THE TERMS OF THEIR SUPERVISION. ALSO NOTE PROPOSAL COULD ACHIEVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FURTHER SAVINGS IF IT WAS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR US SOME% OF THE OTHER SAVINGS THAT OCCURS THROUGH THE REDUCTIONS AND THE. VISUALS ON ELECTRONIC MONITORING. IF YOU TURN THE PAGE EIGHT YOU'LL SEE A DISCUSSION OF THE REALIGNMENT OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR- PUT IN PLACE A PLAN THAT WOULD HAVE TRANSITION THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE OUT OF CDC ARE AND MAKE IT ITS OWN AND APART INDEPENDENT DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. THE MAY REVISION- CANCELS OUT TRANSITION AND SCORES ROUGHLY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH FUNDING PROVIDED FOR THAT TRANSITION. IT ALSO PROPOSES TO REALIGN BJJ TO COUNTY RESPONSIBILITY BY STOPPING INTAKE OF NEW YOUTH TO DJJ BEGINNING JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ALLOWING DE JJ'S POPULATION TO DECLINE THROUGH ATTRITION. THE BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES COUNTIES FUNDING TO HELP COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSING USE WHO WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN SENT TO DJJ WHILE THESE CHANGES ONLY CREATE ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF NET SAVINGS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE ACTUAL CLOSURE OF DJJ WOULD CREATE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS IN FUTURE YEARS. WE WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING THIS PROPOSAL AS IT'S GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRIOR RECOMMENDATIONS HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS. SEPARATELY WE'D RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION TO SET A CONCRETE DATE FOR THE FULL CLOSURE OF DJJ BY JUNE THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THAT THIS- LANGUAGE ALLOW COUNTIES TO CONTRACT WITH THE J. J. AT THE FULL STATE COST TO ASSIST THEM WITH THIS TRANSITION. THAT IT INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO RECALL DJJ WARDS BEFORE THAT FINAL CLOSURE DATE AND THAT IT CALLS ON BSE SEE TO. DO A STUDY OF THE AMOUNT IT COSTS TO RUN AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS DATA WOULD BE USED TO ESTABLISH THE REALIGNMENT FUNDING FORMULA AND THIS REPORT WOULD BE DUE FROM THE SEC BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN ADDITION GIVEN THAT THE ELIMINATION OF D. J. COULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF INCREASING THEM NOT THE NUMBER OF YOUTHS CHARGED AS ADULT WE WERE TOLD. WE'D RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED VARIOUS STATUTORY CHANGES TO MITIGATE THIS SITE INCREASING OF THE JUVENILECOURTS- AGE OF JURISDICTION FROM TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY FIVE AND ALLOWING LOCAL JUVENILE FACILITIES TO HOLD USE- WHO ARE SENTENCED IN ADULT COURT PRIOR TO THEM BEING SPENT. TO CDC ARE WE ALSO LIKE TO KNOW RESPECT TO CBC OURS BUDGET THAT IN VERY IS IT IT IS NOT ACCOUNT THE LAFAYETTE OF KOBE NIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE CALL LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR IMPLEMENTED AT THE INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PRO I'M- IS A VERY LARGE EXPANSION IN THE BILL. HEALTH PROGRAMS IN THE SENS IT WAS SO TO END BY NINETY ONE MAY DOLLARS BETWEEN NOW. TO AND THE BUDGET YEAR THE NAY REVISION INCLUDES THIS NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO STOP DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY OF pBEING CURTAILED DUE TO PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. GIVEN THIS WE THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE FULL NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE NECESSARY AND RECOMMEND A MORE MODEST EXPANSION OF ONLY FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD CREATE FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. IN ADDITION THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ABOVE THE ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BASE BUDGET FOR MEDICAL GUARDING AND TRANSPORTATION- HOWEVER AGAIN DUE TO VISIT SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THE PRISONS THERE- FEWER MEDICAL TRANSPORTS OUTSIDE OF PRISONS IN WITHIN PRISONS AND SO E THINK IT'S LIKELY THAT SOME OR ALL OF THAT FOURTEEN MILLION. DOLLAR INCREASE ON THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BASE BUDGET WON'T BE NECESSARY. OF FINELY THERE OBVIOUSLY VARIOUS CASELOAD ADJUSTMENTS ON THESE CASELOAD ADJUSTMENTS HOWEVER HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED AGAIN TO ACCOUNT FOR CODE NINETEEN ACCORDINGLY WE'D RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT. TO DO FISCAL AND CASE LOAD ESTIMATES TO BE RELEASED BY OCTOBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY THAT DO REFLECT THE AFFECTS OF NINETEEN. SO NOW IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN OF YOUR HAND OUT WILL DISCUSS A FINALS US SOME OTHER NOTABLE PROP- PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION RELATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE MAI REVISION REMOVES FUNDING THE EXPAND. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. AS YOU'LL RECALL THE LEGISLATURE IMPLEMENTED LEGISLATION ALLOWING- IG TO INITIATE AUDITS REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS ON ITS OWN AND PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ENABLE IT TO DO SO THE MAY REVISION ELIMINATES THIS FUNDING WHICH WOULD LIKELY LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE O. I. G. TO ENGAGE IN THESE ACTIVITIES. THE MAY REVISION ALSO PROPOSES TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INMATES BEING RELEASED EARLY FROM PRISON TO THE SUPERVISION OF COUNTY PROBATION- WELL THE STATE IS TYPICALLY PROVIDED THIS FUNDING TO OFFSET THE SHORT TERM INCREASING COSTS THEY EXPERIENCE WHEN THESE EARLY RELEASES OF HER. THE STATE IS NOT OBLIGATED TO DO SO AS THESE COSTS WILL BE OFFSET BY FUTURE SAVINGS ARE GIVEN THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS BE ELIMINATED. FINALLY WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE MAI REVISION MAKES VARIOUS- CHANGES TO PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. IT PROPOSES TO REPORT PROCREATE. TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN UNSPENT ONE TIME GENERAL FUNDS- SUPPORT PROVIDED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT SUPPORTED INCREASED DISTANCE LEARNING TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IT ALSO PROPOSES TO REVERT SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN UNSPENT ONE TIME GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. APPROPRIATED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FOR IMPLICIT BIAS AND PROCEDURAL DRESSED JUSTICE TRAINING- APPROPRIATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR USE OF FORCE- OR CRISIS MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING. AS WELL AS LOCAL ASSIST FINDING PROVIDED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY. WE KNOW THAT THE REAPPROPRIATION OF THE TEN MILLION FOR DISTANCE LEARNING COULD. EXPAND HOW THE STATE PROVIDES TRAINING TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WELL THE REVISIONS WOULD HELP ADDRESS THE VISION OF THE J. ONE BUT- WE NEED TO WAIT. LET PRIOR TO A OF THESE PROGRAMS. HI WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OR TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF. YOU WILL HEAR FROM. TIONS BERMAN FINANCE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR STEVEN BANDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL JUST HAVE MAKE A FEW COMMENTS- ACROSS VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS ON THE NOTE THAT I DO HAVE FOR COLLEAGUES IN THE ROOM WITH ME SO THEY CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAIL OR QUESTIONS A GOOD GEN I'M ANSWER. SO IN REGARDS TO YEAH. ELIO WITH LOW ABOUT THE COMMITTEE POWERS FUNDING I WOULD AGREE THAT LAST YEAR'S A BUDGET ACT DID- REQUIRE REPORTING ON HOW THE FUNDING WAS SPENT- WE'RE FINE WITH THAT REQUIREMENT. BUT WE ARE OPPOSED TO ADOPTING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE HI BEING TOO PRESCRIPTIVE IN ADVANCE AS TO HOW THE FUNDING WILL BE SPLIT AND USED. I THINK WE LEARNED FROM LAST YEAR IS THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH ANY LEVEL OF ACCURACY AND ADVANCE EXACTLY. WILL BE THE MOST PRESSING NEED DISEASE EVENTS TO OCCUR. AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL SHE TRIES TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN HAVING A PREPARED PLAN FOR WHAT WE ARE INTENDING TO DO. BUT ALSO PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY SO THAT SPENDING CAN DECISIONS CAN BE MADE IN THE REAL TIME BASED ON THE CONDITIONS THAT WE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE SO WE ARE OPPOSED TO HAVING ANYTHING TOO PRESCRIPTIVE- HAPPY TO CONTINUE CALM. THE SHINS ABOUT HOW TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE. IN REGARDS TO THE CDAFUNDING JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT NONE OF THE AUGMENTATION FUNDING THAT'S PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS RELATED TO PROVIDE NINETEEN. ALL OF THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH STRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT RESULTED FROM PRIOR DISASTERS SUCH AS THE CAMPFIRE AND VARIOUS OTHERS. AND THEN I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- DISASTER PLANNING PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE FUNDING AND JUST NOTE THAT- WERE OPPOSED TO THE ALLEY OWES RECOMMENDATION FOR LIMITED TERM FUNDING UP IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HIRE PERMANENT POSITIONS WITH LIMITED TERM FOR AT. AND THEN. THIS PROPOSAL. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BEFORE YOU'RE COVERED WORKLOAD WAS EVEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SO THIS WORKLOAD ISN'T ISN'T REALLY RELATED TO. HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL- INFLUX THERE IS FROM COVERT NINETEEN. THIS IS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF A STUDY STATE NEEDED ON GO ON OUR WORKLOAD AT THE DEPARTMENT OF ART YES. AND THEN JUST ON THE VERSION OF LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATIONS IT IS THE NO IT'S JUST THAT IT'S UNCLEAR SOME OF THIS IS DONE AND- REASONS WHY SOME OF THIS FUNDING. HASN'T GONE OUT YET OF STEP. BY YOUR PROGRAM PROGRAM AND- KIND OF DISCUSS THE SPECIFIC REVISIONS WITH. STEP OR ARE. TO GET MORE DETAIL THE SPACE WEAPONS. I'M TALKING ABOUT SEE ARE A POPULATION BECAUSE- YOU ARE NOT THE POPULAR ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MAYOR VERSION WERE COMPLETED BEFORE COVERT RELATED TO RESPONSE AND OTHER CHANGES POPULAR TOOK PLACE. SO BASED ON INITIAL ESTIMATES AND THERE'S GOING TO BE OBVIOUSLY CHANGES SINCE THE MAYOR VISION AND YOU KNOW HAPPEN TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF. THE JOB SINCE SIT. AS WE GO THROUGH OUR REGULAR. FALL UDGET BUILDING FOR IN REGARDS TO PRISON CLOSURE IS ONE A NOT THAT A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE SELECT THAN A NUMBER OF FACTORS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE SELECTING WHICH PERSONS ARE CLOSED. KING PRISONS FOR CLOSURE. MAY IMPACTS CITIES YOURS ABILITY TO OPERATE THOSE FACILITIES AND LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO RECRUIT RETAIN EMPLOYEES THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR THE MINISTRATION. ADDITIONALLY THE PROP CLOSE THE MAYOR VISION WERE EITHER EXISTING PROJECT SORRY. THE PROJECT THE KAPLAN PROJECTS PROPOSING MAYOR VISION WERE EITHER EXISTING PROJECTS ACTIVELY IN CONSTRUCTION PHASES% OR PROJECTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE COMPLY WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS. CLOSER PORT CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD I WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS. IN REGARDS TO THE MED GUARD SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPPOSED TO ALIENS RECOMMENDATION BASED ON THE WORKLOAD PROJECTIONS AND BACKLOG FOR SPECIFIC OR SPECIALTY MEDICAL SERVICES. WE ANTICIPATE THE WORKLOAD TO BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS ASSUMED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OF AND THEN IN REGARDS TO GIGI ALIGNMENT- THIS IS A PRIORITY PROJECT A PROPOSAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- EXPANDS ON ADMINISTRATIONS AND IT STATES PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO ENABLE USED TO MAINTAIN THEIR- TO REMAIN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND STAY CLOSE TO THEIR FAMILIES. WHICH IS SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR REAL DILATATION ACTIVITIES THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONTINUING TO REFINE THIS PROPOSAL AND LOOKS FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS- HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH- LA RECOMMENDATION SPECIFICALLY. SETTING A DATE SPECIFIC FOR YOU DJJ CLOSURE- AS WELL AS SETTING MECHANISM FOR COUNTIES TO CONTRACT WITH THE JUDGE IN THE SHORT TERM. AND PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO RECALL DJ WARDS BEFORE THE FINAL CLOSURE DAY. WE BELIEVE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSING LARGE FACILITIES. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ALLOWING COUNTIES TO CONTRACT BACK WITH THE J. J. COULD LEAD TO SOME LOGISTIC CHALLENGES AS WELL AS OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD SLOW THE CLOSURE OF G. JJ. DID YOU THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SAKES. PSYCHIATRY REGISTRY SERVICES AS WELL AS CONTINUED FUNDING FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT FOR THE INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM. BOTH OF WHICH ARE PRIORITY ACTIVITIES FROM ADMINISTRATION A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS OF THE FEDERAL COURTS ANY REDUCTIONS OR REMOVAL OF FUNDING FOR THESE CRITICAL AREAS AS RECOMMENDED BY THE AUDIO COULD INHIBIT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS MEET FEDERAL COURT MANDATES. I WITH THAT WERE HAPPY TO- TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. FROM THE FROM THE MANY. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK US BOTH OF YOU LA- AND PART OF FINANCE FOR YOUR- ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF THE MAY REVISION- I THINK WE HAVE- AND I WANT TO THANK ILLEGAL AYE I THINK YOU'VE RAISED A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT I HAD ACTUALLY DONE A FIGHT ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT- THE ISSUE OF WHICH WE'VE DONE FOR. A NUMBER OF YEARS THE ISSUE OF CLOSING PRISONS. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. AND HAVE ASKED FOR A PLAN. FROM CDC ARE. A PRIORITY PLAN WE'VE SAID WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO MAJOR CONSTRUCTION OUR RENOVATIONS IF WE DIDN'T KNOW. WHAT PRISON WAS GOING TO BE CLOSED DOWN. AND WE HAVE YET TO GET A PLAN WE HAVE YET TO GET THE PRIORITY SO AND TERMS OF. WHAT SHOULD BE THE STANDARDS TO BE USED IN SO WE'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE PUTTING TOGETHER. THE PRIORITIES FOR YOU- TO HELP MAKE THIS DECISION BUT WE HAVE YET TO SEE A PLAN. OF FROM- FROM CDC ARE CONCERNING PRISON CLOSURES AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT EXTENSIVELY. BY LEASE FOR THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS. AND NO ONE HAS COME FORWARD WITH THE PLAN SO THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM I THINK ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A CAPITAL OUTLAY AND THINGS THAT WE NEED TO RESOURCES AND WE HAVE SAID VERY CLEARLY. THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS PUT A BRAND NEW ROOF ON A PRISON THAT WE TORE DOWN SIX DOUBLE TEN OUT SIX MONTHS LATER. AND HAVE THAT AS A PART OF THE USE OF RESOURCES ARE REALLY THAT THE USE OF RESOURCES SO- IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO. IN THE PLEASE FOR ME PERSONALLY I SHOULD SAY TO TRUST THE CDC ARE. IS CAPABLE OF MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT CULTURE PRESENCE BECAUSE- OF THEIR VESTED INTEREST IN MAINTAINING PRISONS. SO IT'S A IT'S A AND THE ISSUE. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. TALKING ABOUT. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. AIR AND THE POSITION THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE SOMEONE OVERSIGHT. AND WE FUNDED IT TO HAVE OVERSIGHT. I MEAN WHO BETTER TO TELL US WHICH PRISON THESE TO BE CLOSE IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. OF SURELY NOT THE WARDENS TO TELL US BUT SURELY THEY EXPECT THE GENERAL IF THEY'RE IN AND OUT OF OUR PRISONS. LOOKING AT THE FACILITIES LOOKING AT THE MAINTENANCE OF THINGS AND ALSO HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT IS THERE. SO I FIND IT VERY WELLPERSONALLY- DIFFICULT FOR ME TO. CUT OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL F. WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO REALIZE TO ONCE AGAIN TO RESTORE THEM TO THE POSITION OF. OVERSIGHT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE HAD SO MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT WITHIN OUR PRISONS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS EITHER BEING TREATED. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WE CUT OUT THIS IS ALSO CUTTING OUT THE CAMERAS- IN THE PRISONS THAT TO GIVE US SOME OVERSIGHT SOME EYES AND EARS AND THERE THAT. THAT SO IT SEEMS THAT THE- VALUES THAT WE HAVE A SOMETIME KNOW THAT MAYBE YOU CAN TELL US WHY. HAVE BEEN KIND OF TOSSED OUT THE WINDOW AND WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE WHERE YOU WERE BEFORE. WANT TO KNOW WHY DJJ. ASI SAID WE TALK ABOUT THE COLLISION AND EVERYONE HEARS AGREE THAT THAT. CLOSURE IS A GOOD IDEA WHICH WE DID LAST YEAR EXTENSIVELY IN HEARINGS. WE HEARD FROM HOPE LOTS OF COMMUNITY PEOPLE- TRY TO FORM SOME KIND OF STRIP. BASIN TO DO THAT. AND ACT SCREWED YEAH THE PROJECT. BUT WITH. PROPOSED FOR COMMUNITY PEOPLE SO AS I MEMBERS OF ARE SORRY IS REALLY THE PROCESS YOU KNOW WHAT IS A PROCEDURE THAT'S GOING TO BE IN ENGAGE THEM TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A SAFE AND REASONABLE TRANSITION OF FOR THE FOLKS IN THE JJ SO I THINK THOSE THOSE BECOME EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT. THE KINDS OF GENERAL CUTS OF THE KIND OF CUTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE THAT IS THE YEAR- I'VE BEEN ASKED CLEARLY BY MY COLLEAGUES AS TO WHY IT ALL OF THE OTHER AREAS AND MAYBE YOU CAN ALSO ANSWER THAT UNFORTUNATELY THE CDC IS NOT HERE TO TELL ME WHAT CCC OURS BUT IT IS THE SAME AS IT WAS LAST. OF WITH THIS SHIFTING AND- ELSE'S EXPERIENCE. MAJOR CUTS AND WE SEE THAT THE- CDC ARE HAS HAD PROBABLY ZERO CUTS.% A WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BACK OF PAGE. ONE WELL WE STARTED THE AMOUNT OF THE PERCENTAGE OF CHANGE. IS REALLY NEGLIGIBLE. IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. IN JANUARY AND WHAT THEY HAVE NOW- STILL THIRTEEN POINT SOME ODD BILLION DOLLARS GOING INTO CDC ARE. A WOULD SHIFT OUT AND IN TERMS OF THINGS THAT WE VALUE. AND YEAH WE GET UP IN THE SAME SPOT IN TERMS OF MONEY. NO THAT OUR SCHOOL PEOPLE ASKING WHY IS IT THIS THE ONLY ENTITY. AND HAS NOT EXPERIENCE ANY MADE CUTS THAT ARE THERE. BLACK BUT YOU ALSO SEE AND IS A I'M JUST RAISING A THINK THAT ARE. WE TO RAISE AS WE DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO. AGREE TO AND WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO AGREE TO. AND CLEARLY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS ARE HOUSING AND- AND FOLKS WHO LEAVING PRISON WERE EXONERATED AND STILL NOT GETTING RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE. BUT YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT TRIGGER CUTS AND SO. OR OR THAT FINANCED THAT THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON WOULD TRIGGER. NO CUTS COULD YOU IN IN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PARTICULARLY EXPLAIN TO US SO WE CLEARED THE PUBLIC. WHAT IT MEANS TO TALK ABOUT TRIGGERING CUTS. OFF FROM THE BUDGET. NO IN FINANCE WOULD WELL SOMEBODY'S ON TAKE THAT YEAR OKAY. COULD YOU TELL US WHAT IT MEANS TO TRIGGER CUTS. WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT PROCESS WHAT WE NEED TO BE WATCHING OUT FOR. SURE THIS CRYSTAL FURTHER WITH THAT AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- ESSENTIALLY OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS ARE PREPARING FOR THE EVENT IN WHICH WE WERE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL- FEDERAL FUNDS AND SO. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER WE WILL RAISE THE IF I'M ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FINES WHAT SORT OF PARAMETERS MAY BE PLACED ON THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS AND THEN ALSO AND- EACH WE PUT TOGETHER THESE TRIGGERING BASS REDUCTION- ISSUES FOR EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE SO- ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD HAVE TO WAY. I'M WHICH OF THESE TRIGGERS ESSENTIALLY RIGHTS TO- UP PRIORITY I IN THE EVENT THAT WE HAVE LIMITED AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS THAT COME AND- SO- I'M THAT BASS REDUCTION TRIGGER LIVES ACROSS THESE DEPARTMENTS. ARE SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT SO THESE ARE PRELIMINARY LISTED HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER. ISSUES THAT. IN THE EVENT FOR A FUNDS COME IN WE COULD RESTORE SOME OF THESE FUNDING LEVELS BUT AS I MENTIONED THESE ARE SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT AND ALL THE CAPULETS AROUND THE ACTUAL FEDERAL FUNDS AND HOW MUCH CONTENT. TO THEIR NUMBER TRIGGERS THROUGHOUT NOT ONLY IN OUR BUDGET BUT THROUGHOUT THE OTHER BUT JUST SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY ALL GET IN LINE. AND THEN WHO DETERMINES WHO'S AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE AT THE BACK OF THE LINE. I'M I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY AROUND THAT PROCESS- AND AGAIN THESE LIST AREN'T. A FINAL AT THIS POINT THEY'RE SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT AND- AND CERTAINLY TO- ENGAGEMENT- WITH THE UP WITH THE APPROPRIATE THAT STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE SO. I'M YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE THAT THE PROCESS FOR. FOR WHO DETERMINES THAT I THINK. I'M AGAIN. AND IT'LL BE ANOTHER CONVERSATION I BASED ON THE ON THE PRIORITIES AND ULTIMATELY WHAT. I'M ACTIONS ARE TAKEN. I'M IN THE IN THE COMMITTEES. SO I ASSUME THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT IT WOULD HAVE AT LEAST A LIST OF PRIORITIES ARE. SOME IDEA OF WHERE FOLKS ARE IN THE IN THE LINE FOR CUTS SO THEY'VE RESOURCES COME AND IF THEY DON'T ALL COME INTO- AS ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME. DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE CONCERNING HOW THOSE CUTS HAVE THOSE TRIGGERS WHAT WHAT IS TRIGGERED AND WHAT SHOULD BE FUNDED AS A RESULT O THE TRIGGER. A BASED ON OUR PRIORITIES THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL RATHER THAN JUST DISCOVERING THAT THE TRIGGER HAS STRINGS OF HAPPEN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN. WE'RE WITH THE- YOU GIVEN ANY. AT ALL THE PROPS. TO BEING. IN TODAY WITH CLOSE PRISONS. OF MOVING DJJ. OF ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AS THEY BEEN ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. YES AS YOU KNOW AND I AM IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE WERE ALREADY ENVISIONED NAME I'M CLOSING AT THE STATE PRISON AND IT CERTAINLY IS A PRIORITY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION- AS WE'VE NOTED BEFORE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME AND- CONSTRAINTS ON ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING. OF THOSE PRISONS BUT CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO SET THOSE CRITERIA SOME OF WHICH ARE ACTUALLY SET INTO STATUTE- SO THAT IS. SORT PUBLIC BACK RIGHT HERE YEH THAT WE ARE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. I'M IT I'M SORRY DID YOU I WAS QUESTION ON A FUTURE DAY YEAH WHAT COMES FIRST THE LIST FOR THE PRISON TO BE CLOSED OR THE CAPITAL OUT. RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU KNOW. I'M IT'S NOT A CERTAIN AT THIS TIME WHEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED PLANS YEAH OF THE WHICH PRISON WILL BE CLOSED AND AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THERE SOME EXCEPT CONCERNS IN TERMS OF PUBLICLY I MEAN I PERCENT OF BECAUSE OF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OFFICE IS ONE OF THE BIG CONCERN SO I'M THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ON WHEN THE WHEN THE TIMING OF THAT WOULD BE. OKAY AS ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. YEAH I DON'T YEAH THAT'S SOMETHING I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA GET A LOT OF CHANCES BUT GO AHEAD. AND MAYBE SOME MOST OF THIS YOU MAY WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON I WHEN I GOT HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE. I DO IT'S LIKE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. UNCOLLECTED FEES AND FIND. AND I CAN REMEMBER RECOMMENDING. GETTING SOMEONE TO COLLECT THAT MONEY SOON COULD GENERATE SOME REVENUE. pEVEN SAYING SOMETHING AS A AS A UNION GUY SAYING THINGS LIKE MAYBE GIVEN IT TO A COLLECTION AGENCY WE GET FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR LISA GOT SOMETHING BACK. AND I WAS PUSHED BACK FROM THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY WOULD HANDLE IT SO CAN I GET UP A REPORT ON. WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN BECAUSE AGAIN THAT'S ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FEES AND FINES THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT TO. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN SAVE. ON PRISON CLOSURES HOW YOU CAN PUT IN A REPORT. THESE CHANGES GREAT SIX POINT FOUR MILLION AND SAVINGS AND 202-120-2020 TWENTY ONE. AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN MORE IN FUTURE SAVINGS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT FACILITIES WERE TALKING ABOUT. I REMEMBER BUILDING NEW POLICE BASILIDES WITH HOLDING CELLS. AND THEN WE MOVE STAFF AND WAS A BIG ENOUGH BECAUSE IT TOOK FIVE YEARS SOMETIMES TEN YEARS TO BUILD IT. BUILDING COSTS WENT UP AND IN THE SPIRIT WE HAD FIVE YEARS AGO WE'RE TOTALLY IRRELEVANT. ON FIVE YEARS LATER AND- IT WAS A BIG ENOUGH AND SO YOU REALLY DO NEED TO KNOW THE FACILITY AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO MOVE TO PERSONNEL. I THINK EVEN BEFORE YOU COME UP WITH A NUMBER SO WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL. ON HOW YOU. KIND OF FIGURED EVEN TO SIX POINT FOUR IN SAVINGS WHAT IS THAT BASED ON. AND A MOVING FORWARD I WOULD EVEN LOVE TO HELP YOU WITH. HOW TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM A CLOSE FACILITY TO WE'RE GOING TO BE STAFFING NEXT. IN ADDITION. ON THE- ELIMINATING DJJ AND. AND SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WERE WE'RE DOING OUR MOVING THINGS DOWN TO THE COUNTY WE DID THAT BEFORE IT WAS CALLED AB ONE OWN NINE WELL WE JUST JUMPED EVERYONE BECAUSE OF A FISCAL PROBLEM AND MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WERE UNDER A FEDERAL MANDATE. WE JUST DID IT WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY WITH NO PROCEDURES ON HOW THESE INDIVIDUALS WHAT THEY GOT TO THE COUNTY LEVEL. HOW THEY WOULD NOT RECIDIVIST HOW WE NOT BECOME A OUR FARM A DETRIMENT BUT MOST IMPORTANT HOW THE JAILS WOULD BE IMPACTED AND DO WE GIVE THEM ENOUGH RESOURCES FUNDING. SO THEY BECOME COULD SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY GOT THERE AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE TURN ABOUT DJJ. AND SEEM TO THE COUNTIES OF DO WE HAVE A FULL PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SUCCESSFUL. BUT AND THEN ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. I'M LOOKING AT A LIST OF CODED NINETEEN YES THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN PRISONS THAT ARE THAT NOTE THOSE NUMBERS ARE INCREASING I THINK WE NEED TO FULLY FUND AN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. BECAUSE WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND ARE GOING ON IN C. C. R. WE NEED INSPECTOR GENERAL TO GIVE US. I'LL SAY UNTAINTED BUT A THIRD PARTY ASSESSMENT. OF HOW WE CAN- HOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD SO THAT WE DON'T. SEND OUT THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS BACK OUT IN THE COMMUNITY WE DON'T CONTINUE TO INFECT PEOPLE THAT ARE WITHIN THE FACILITIES WE PROTECT NOT ONLY THE INMATES BUT MOST IMPORTANT- THIS STAFF THAT'S THERE- THE CORRECTION OFFICERS- THE NURSES THE DOCTORS. ON THE CLERICAL PEOPLE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE ALSO WE NEED TO PUT THAT EFFORT IN THERE AND COME UP WITH. OF THINGS THERE TO MAKE THAT THAT. THAT INFECTION DOESN'T IMPACT THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AS THEY GO BACK AND FORTH OUT. OF THE PRISON INSTANCE. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I DON'T WANNA GO ONE BY ONE. BUT I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE- DOES QUESTIONS GET ANSWERED SO I DON'T KNOW IF. AGAIN LIKE DR WEBER SAID I DON'T KNOW. IF WE HAVE TIME OR SOMEONE WANTS TO. JUMP IN A CHAIRED ITS BACON RIGHT NOW AND- AND GIVE IT A SHOT OR- YADA YADA SCREENSHOT SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE SCRAMBLING. OR OR WHAT IS THIS SOMETHING YOU MAY WANT TO COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE EITHER IN A WRITTEN REPORT OR YOU WANT TO COME BACK- US IN LA- WANTS TO RESPOND OKAY. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GO FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITH A HERE FRANKLY YES CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW I CAN HEAR YOU YES OKAY GREAT SO I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND A BIT TO THE CONCERN THAT IDENTIFYING THE PRISONS FOR CLOSURE WOULD HARM- RECRUITMENT FIRST OF ALL ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT GIVEN THE UNFORTUNATE ECONOMIC- CLIMATE THAT WERE IN IN HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT IT SEEMS LIKE RECRUITMENT IS GOING TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY EASIER THAN IT WAS IN THE PAST. AND IT DID AND I WANTED TO NOTE THAT IN YOU KNOW RECENT ARTICLES- THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT RELATED TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A PRISON CLOSURE SOME- AS PRISON EMPLOYEES ARE SAYING THAT THEY WOULD PREFERRED THAT THE PRISON SLATED FOR CLOSURE BE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE RATHER THAN WILD MINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT IDENTIFYING THAT PRESENT WILL MAKE YOU KNOW THE HUNDREDS OF THEM PLEASE ADD A PRISON NERVOUS WITHOUT IDENTIFYING IT OR MAKE IT ALL THE EMPLOYEES AND THE SYSTEM NERVOUS BECAUSE NOBODY SURE. WHICH PRISON CLOSED OR IF THEY COULD BE OUT OF PRISON MEDLEY BE CLOSED ALSO WITH RISK TO THE RECOMMENDATION ON STICKY ADDRESS REGISTRY FUNDING WAS BROUGHT UP ARE BROKEN WAS TO FUND BUT TO JUST TO TARGET THE INCREASED FUNDING AT THE FACILITIES THAT ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY RECRUITING SO TIRED BREASTS WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A MORE MODEST IN ON ALSO HAVE TO RESPOND TO- ANY OTHER POINTS THAT YOU WOULD. LIKE ME TO RESPOND TO THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE COURSE. I OKAY. SELECT MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH HOW CD'S ARE IN THE HOUSING BECAUSE BACK CONVICTED AT THE BUT NOT YET. TO EIGHTEEN. YES SERIOUSLY YEAH I GUESS IT WOULD BE CITY SEE OURSELVES. I'LL JUST AS ARE SOME OF THE CONTENTS OF THAT. FINANCE EVEN ANSWERED OR ARE YOU L. L. YES. I'D BE SO- WERE STILL REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEY MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO OR THEIR PLAN BUT ONE OF THE MODIFICATIONS THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND IS THAT STATUTE BE CHANGED TO ALLOW. LOCAL CORRECTIONAL A LOCAL YOUTH CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES TO HOUSE THOSE YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AS ADULTS BUT ARE- I HAD BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN- IN ADDITION WE'D ALSO RECOMMEND INCREASING THE JURISDICTION OF THE JUVENILE COURTS TO TWENTY FIVE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH THAT OCCURS. OKAY OKAY AND THIS IS KIND OF BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH OF AN ANSWER- AND MAYBE THERE IS NO ANSWER BUT- IF SOMEONE OF EVENTUALLY IS GOT TO ANSWER THIS. AS WITH THE SHIP TO THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THE ELIMINATION OF DJJ. DO IS A LEGISLATURE GIVE UP- OUR- OUR COMPLAINT OVERSIGHT OF THE TREATMENT REHABILITATION OF THESE YOU. AND WE DO HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR ABOUT. THIS IS CRYSTAL SURE THAT WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT AN EXPERT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS I DOES CURRENTLY AND PROVIDE SOME OVER OVERSIGHT I'M IN THAT WOULD CONTINUE FOR THESE YOUTH- THAT WOULD BE AND I CAN I FACILITIES. HAVING MISSED STONE ALSO RAISE THAT ISSUE EARLIER. THAT WHICH WE CANNOT GIVE UP OUR OVERSIGHT SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S SOME KIND OF REFLECTED IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR SOMETHING SO THAT. THE KIND OF SERVICES OUR STUDENTS GET OUR CARE KIDS GET IT NOT DEPENDENT UPON WHAT COUNTY THEY LIVE IN. YOU KNOW. GOOD TO HAVE SOME HORRIBLE SITUATIONS IT'S A WONDERFUL SITUATION SO WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY. OF THE RESOURCES IN THE SUPPORT IN THE OUTCOMES THAT WE LIKE TO SEE. YOUNG PEOPLE AS A RESULT OF THAT ENGAGEMENT. SO I THINK THE ISSUE OF US GIVING UP. OUR OVERSIGHT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN RAISED AND I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THAT. DOES NOT HAPPEN. OKAY BUT ISSUE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR NO ONE ANSWERED ENDING A LINE TO LET ME. PICK ONE HAS. THE TOPIC ONE BABY DO DO YOU DO. BRING IT OPPORTUNITY BRING IN REVENUE. THIS IS SO TO ASK IN TWENTY TWELVE EDIT I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE NOW. S. R. THIS IS I'M A GENEROUS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK- YOU KNOW I CAN HAVE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SEND YOU THE MOST RECENT COLLECTIONS REPORT- IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT- I THINK A LOT OF THE UNCOLLECTED FINES AND FEES ARE. ARE REALLY FROM YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY ANYWAYS- AND SO THAT'S WHY THERE IS QUITE A LARGE- I'M COLLECTED THAT BALANCE BUT I THINK THAT'S- A KIND OF SENSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR ABILITY TO PAY PROPOSAL THAT WE'VE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET- BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PROPOSAL WOULD WAIVE FINES AND FEES FOR INDIVIDUALS BY AT LEAST 50% IF NOT. I'M MORE OF A BASED ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION I THINK. YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE UNIT AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ARE WORKING T TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE SO THAT WAY WE CAN BE ABLE TO COLLECT REVENUES- FROM FINES AND FEES. I'VE BEEN I. WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY PLAN IS BECAUSE- IF YOUR PLAN IS TO KEEP. IF YOU HAVE NO PLANS. BUT I'VE EVEN HEARD FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR I HAVEN'T HEARD AN AMNESTY PROGRAM EVER HEARD ANYTHING. FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABOUT HOW TO COLLECT IT OTHER THAN THIS. THE SAME WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. AND WHAT MY POINT IS. YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN EXPECT A DIFFERENT RESULT. WE NEEDED THAT MONEY IN TWENTY TWELVE. 271-516-1718 NINETEEN TWENTY. EVER NEEDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WHAT ARE WE DOING ONE WEEK TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THAT AND MORE IMPORTANT IS PROBABLY AN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS JUST TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL THAT. THAT COULD BE ANOTHER STATE STATE WE COULD GET OFF THE BOOKS SO I DON'T. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS A KIND OF A PRIORITY ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WILL HELP. WITH ANY BUDGET GAP THAT A FEW DISCOUNTS PASS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER AT THIS IS- G. SORT OF WORK WITH LA- AGAIN- I WOULD NOTE THAT OUR OFFICE A FEW YEARS AGO DID PUT OUT- SERIES OF REPORTS ON STEPS THE STATE COULD TAKE TO IMPROVE- THE COLLECTION A COURT ORDER DEBT AND WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENSURE HAT YOU AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- HAVE A COPY OF THIS REPORT. THANK YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY IMPLEMENTED ANY YOUR IDEAS I DON'T BELIEVE ARE I DON'T. IDEAS WERE IMPLEMENTED NOW. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC.

I JUST WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE- THE DISTANCE LEARNING- POST GRANT PROGRAM IS THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE BUDGET- SPECIFICALLY- BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW OR WAS THAT ALREADY. IN PROCESS. THAT THE FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM WAS- FIRST PROVIDED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUT THE FUNDS WEREN'T FULLY EXPENDED SO THEY'RE GOING THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO RE APPROPRIATE THEM- SO WHEN ORIGINALLY PROPOSED IT DIDN'T HAVE COVERT NINETEEN IN MIND BUT I WOULD DEFER TO THE ADMINISTRATION AS TO WHETHER THE- REASON THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING A REAPPROPRIATION NOW IS. IN LIGHT OF COVERED NINETEEN. IS IT IS IT COULD DEPARTMENT FINANCE SPEAK ON. TO THAT QUESTION. THIS IS THE PART OF FINANCE AND YES HE AMOUNT THAT IS BEING RIVER LABOR TO SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION AS WELL AS A TEN MILLION THAT'S BEING RE APPROPRIATED. IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THOSE FUNDS WERE NOT. ABLE TO BE ENCUMBERED. BUT WAS THERE I DID IDEA THAT WE ARE GOING TO GO TOWARDS DISTANCE LEARNING BEFORE OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT SPECIFICALLY BEING PROPOSED NOW. THAT SPECIFICALLY BEING PROPOSED ADAM AS A RESULT OF THE CLUB IN NINETEEN. AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT I'M AT LEAST FOR THE NEAR TERM OKAY INCREASING THIS DISTANCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES- IS GONNA BE IMPORTANT. SO IMAGINE THAT THIS IS A CHALLENGE THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE DEALING WITH SO IS THERE- SOME EFFORT TO COORDINATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTANCE LEARNING TOOLS IN ORDER TO. ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCY. UNFORTUNATELY WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT QUESTION ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. THANK YOU. I WOULD NOT ONE OF THOSE THERE ANYONE ON THE LINE. THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMAN.
