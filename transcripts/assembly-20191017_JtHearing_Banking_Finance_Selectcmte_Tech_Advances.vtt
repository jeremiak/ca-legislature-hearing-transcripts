WEBVTT

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.428
. In Calderon

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.897
and I wanted to first of all

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.565
welcome everyone here to this

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:21.634
hearing I it's been several

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.536
years since the California

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.638
legislature has taken up this

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:27.607
topic and it seems appropriate

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.508
for us to re engage when I was

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.544
appointed chair of the banking

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.479
committee at the beginning of

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.381
twenty eighteen big coin was

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:37.316
trading at a all time high

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:39.385
relative to the U. S. dollar. I

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:41.587
was hearing stories about a

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:43.456
surprising number of people

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:45.458
buying bit coin is some of whom

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:46.125
I would have never expected to

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.727
be interested in virtual

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.662
currencies. I would also hear

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.397
stories about people falling

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.299
victim to fraudulent practices

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.301
by hackers or or French

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.336
companies in the industry. As

00:08:57.403 --> 00:08:59.305
the price a bit coin fluctuated

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:06.212
some of the media attention

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.546
around virtual currencies. At

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:11.384
subsided. Then this summer.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:11.884
Face an ounce this plant

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:14.320
caliber. And once again media

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.256
attention it refocused on the

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:17.857
relatively new and interesting

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:18.391
and interest based in our

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:22.795
financial markets. Well the

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:24.630
media attention has and didn't

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:28.067
load. Had conversations with

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:28.668
colleagues in the legislature

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.302
and the state's financial

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:31.704
regulator. When it is plain the

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:34.173
proper role. In virtual

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.275
currency activities and I think

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.711
this is a difficult question.

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:39.312
Some of these appear to fall

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:40.746
and the purview of our federal

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:42.915
securities regulator the

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:43.416
securities and exchange

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:45.451
commission. Other activity your

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:48.087
to fall under the purview

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:48.654
arrestees finance regulator

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:49.121
department of business

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:51.490
oversight. And still other

00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:54.193
activities do. Clearly fall

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.431
under the purview of any

00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:01.400
existing federal or state laws.

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.302
While I have had a number of

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:03.970
companies come to my office to

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:06.272
explain can use your own state

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:15.348
laws some of them ask for very.

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:15.948
Occasions to be provided I the

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.284
new laws. My colleague. Leader

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:21.787
cal on has introduced number of

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:22.388
bills related block. Business

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.022
over the past few years this

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:23.622
year he introduced assembly

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:27.259
bill four nine which proposes a

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:28.861
uniform law firm states across

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:29.328
the country should be

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:30.429
regulating virtual currency

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:33.666
businesses. To be clear the

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:38.504
committee well the ladies will

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:41.407
not be taking any action on

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.209
that fill up or any other bills

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:43.676
to date this is just a

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.545
description. It is believed to

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:47.079
a former all the relevant

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:51.617
issue. Now with the right to

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:52.151
act on the ledges as the

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:52.685
legislature reconvenes in

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.454
Sacramento. Is hearing the will

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:56.822

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.524
interact. Virtual currency

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:02.795
markets today. We also state

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:05.264
regular regulatory ext on the

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.732
recommendation how California

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:09.301
should be position today both

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:13.005
businesses and users a virtual

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:13.672
currency is can help the market

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:19.011
place. I will now turn over my

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.080
time to majority leader Ian

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:23.949

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:19.238
one facet of you know the of

facet of action technology when

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:28.247
it comes digital currency but

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:28.814
there are a lot of different

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:29.415
applications when it comes to

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.083
that technology. Real I were

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.653
able to start for a lot more

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.221
attention on this topic. I

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:40.693

Firemen getting pop thank

created working. To explore how

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:39.785
our stake in from the

deployment of blockchain. I

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:44.256
knew that I know that it will

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.425
two five. The Tory. Technology

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.026
can ensure the goal of the

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:48.227
blockchain working group is to

on California can courage

00:13:57.136 --> 00:14:01.106
innovation. And invest in this

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:01.707
technology as it is crews will

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.642
take well Gee usage. Current I

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:04.797
that now I'd like to welcome

00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:09.802
our first panel. The

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:10.402
perspective of the business we

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:11.036
have alley Medina is the exact

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:14.073
direction. Out of a coalition

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:14.673
Brian Brooks who is the chief

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.310
legal officer corps. And Stuart

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:19.678
elder elderly. They say that

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:24.149
right. All the ready general

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:37.629
cal at rebel. Thank you so much

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:38.263
for having us here trailer down

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.532
in the majority around and also

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:41.166
thank you so much this college

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:43.335
for hosting us. I am the

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:43.869
director of the blockchain

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:46.505
advocacy coalition and a former

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:47.172
community college to California

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.174
myself I'm looking out to see

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:49.842
co Litt formed about a year ago

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:54.480
when a group mailbox the

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.215
current is in the. Bay area

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.183
realize there is no prize

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:03.622
advocacy after. Street in the

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:11.697
state. Of. An industry to give

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:12.297
high level overview of what it

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:15.534
looks like California. Hundred

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:17.369
and thirty four block. State

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:17.903
which sounds like really

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.638
healthy growth once you compare

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.807
that to the global increase

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.208
which went up three and a half

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:26.512
times over the same time period

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:30.549
so last year the United States

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:31.150
the seven point 2% a global

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:31.683
market share in California

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.220
accounted for nearly 12% What

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:39.758
has twenty. 9% California has

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:40.325
dropped to under 10% of the

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:40.926
global market share. Virtual

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:43.495
currency. Her that against

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:45.764
other. California mostly hold

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.298
around 2225% of the global

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.000
market share across other tech

00:17:48.066 --> 00:17:49.334
industries which means we have

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:54.940
a disproportionately small

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:55.407
amount the blockchain

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:56.008
cryptocurrency community here

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:58.410
and you look at her I did

00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:04.516
that's an ongoing trend since

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.083
two thousand twelve with the

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.651
law market share compared.

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.319
Global a critical. More

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:07.820
consistently losing the

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:12.357
industry. Point probably

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:14.493
Facebook's libra that and maybe

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.329
the business analyst. Is a lot

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:17.830
of other products being

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:21.967
California the to use this

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:22.634
technology for example propping.

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:23.902
Streamlined the transactions on

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:25.537
blockchain Vegas creating your

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:27.406
identity platforms. Last year

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:31.643
IBM and sweet I. What did areas

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.412
that are over drafted from

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.848
offers to trade water on

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:36.415
blockchain and platforms the

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:38.183
vast majority of businesses in

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:38.750
the state are not extremely

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:42.955
large I did two thirds of them

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:49.094
have ten or fewer and fees and

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:49.728
the median funding of two point

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.430
five million dollars. The

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:54.032
industry average for tech

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:54.633
companies and four point five

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.667
million dollars for compare.

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:58.203
You will have an over represent.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.704
And the reason is pretty

00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.204
obvious it's regulatory

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:02.040
uncertainty. Okay Stanley

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:02.574
report indicated that the

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.743
greatest predictor of where a

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.344
blockchain a virtual currency

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.247
business will locate is. We

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.848
don't have thirty nine states.

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:13.519
Definitions. Level aye CCC's

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:15.254
that security to see it.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.190
Currency the IRS tax that at

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:22.127
the property in addition to

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:22.661
obtaining necessary even

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:25.097
federal licenses companies that

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:27.266
wish to engage the entire place

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.167
have to comply with licensing

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:33.672
requirements all fifty states.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:37.109
This is. An inordinate amount

00:19:37.175 --> 00:19:40.279
start ups resources and time.

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.580
There's those requirements

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:43.882
really onerous them into Mrs

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:44.449
bit license new York's two

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:45.083
thousand fifteen bill the first

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.952
three years of the BET license

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:47.553
program only five companies

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:48.186
actually obtained a license to

00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:50.088
operate in the state of New

00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:50.656
York. They make the DMB look

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:54.793
expeditious. Headlines about

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.394
agreed the queen accidents and

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.397
many companies chose to leave

00:19:58.463 --> 00:19:59.031
the state rather than pushing a

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:03.235
regulatory bottleneck. In

00:20:03.302 --> 00:20:03.835
Washington two thousand seven

00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:08.273
they passed SB fifty thirty one.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:08.874
Companies again by the leave

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:09.508
the state of Washington record

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.243
look into states like Colorado

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.877
for example issues that were

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:12.411
cited were on the bonding

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:14.713
requirements in data collection

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.213
require pretty more of a

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.415
security hazard the consumer

00:20:16.481 --> 00:20:18.417
protection. Blocking businesses

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:19.952
leave our state country they

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:22.654
mostly get your hands are

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:28.360
placed as- one does California

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:29.561
company to register. You bring

government entered watching

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:33.065

all I never clear fine which

specifically digital assets

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.450
presenting and please contact.

00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:53.885
When a different billion asset

00:20:58.624 --> 00:20:59.157
and recently with the banking

under your- anti money what.

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.601
Clear is the tracking business

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:10.235
as in April of this year taxes

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:10.802
please guidance for virtual

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:12.504
currency companies to the

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:13.138
crypto currencies as currently

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:13.639
implemented cannot be

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:14.272
considered money or money teary

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:14.773
value under their money

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.111
services. It goes on the clerk

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:20.612
I. exactly which sorts of this

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:23.682
is might be considered a money

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:24.883
transmitter and which sorts.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.519
I'm currently this are not

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:33.291
clear. Extremely helpful. Culp

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:33.859
but meant Montana Wyoming.

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:34.893
Actually a lot of blockchain

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.331
register legislation recently

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:39.865
I'll have the difference

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:40.432
between tell the tokens and

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:45.937
other asset types. Okay I'm

00:21:46.004 --> 00:21:46.471
this is a step towards the

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:47.005
structures that we see in

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:47.839
Singapore and sweat better

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:52.110
track of and he- came business

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:56.114
says. So I would applauded.

00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:56.682
Engaging in a complex world

00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:57.249
regulate. I'm and this bill

00:21:57.315 --> 00:22:00.652
they were talking today eight.

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:01.086
For more commission

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:01.720
supplemental act it's all been

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:04.289
introduced in states like

00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:04.923
Nevada Hawaii and Oklahoma it

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.793
currently is based blocking all

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:08.360
of those states. The goal of

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:08.860
streamlining reciprocal

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:13.799
licensing system across state.

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:14.399
Being able to apply just for

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:15.000
one license across all fifty

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:18.503
states we get significan easy.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.104
To operate in the US and reach

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.839
US customers. However passed

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:21.473
that only when you're the plan

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.975
for state specially month and a

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:29.581
to be honest on the top of any

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:30.115
business use less. Have a

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:30.716
customer base is not going to

00:22:30.782 --> 00:22:35.987
do with. Now even if possible

00:22:36.054 --> 00:22:38.223
for states it would. Still

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:38.857
because I am a signature. Block

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:40.125
California this is the find

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:41.693
these requirements too onerous

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.598
to comply with. I'm gonna read

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:47.232
comparison she to the committee

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:47.799
of state parks and rec since

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:52.270
tech. Compare against plans in

00:22:52.337 --> 00:22:52.804
New York as well as others

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.606
require. Here's some things I

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:57.609
think. For the K. sure. That

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.811
are. Already has a look since

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:04.015
our money transfer. State would

00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:04.649
also apply license if it covers

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:05.250
their business. And should be

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:06.918
clear five I it. To this day

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:07.552
consider defining there's a lot

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:09.821
of fun to regulate them

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:11.523
separately as others. Have done

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.494
our wallets transaction. Under

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.030
this framework second capture a

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:19.598
ton of business as- are the

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:20.232
surety bond in personal wealth

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:20.799
requirements prohibitive to

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:22.367
small businesses I know there's

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:25.103
a five thousand dollar

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.771
exemption in the bill that is

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.606
that small amount in two. Rooms

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:29.841
of the state I don't know the

00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:31.710
companies I would be able to

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:32.177
take advantage of that

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:35.347
successfully. It are the.

00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:38.550
Consumer protect living. Tend

00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:39.050
to security risk in this

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:39.684
industry. So thank you so much

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:42.420
for your attention I look for

00:23:42.487 --> 00:23:43.054
to engage on this bill with you

00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:45.824
throughout the next year. Thank

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:46.458
you all right now we will hear

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:46.992
from Brian Brooks is chief

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:51.897
legal officer from going. Well

00:23:51.963 --> 00:23:52.430
up the first of all let me

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:52.998
think a little Calderon and

00:23:53.064 --> 00:23:53.532
surely for convening this

00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:55.333
really timely and important

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.269
hearing. Mister Alvarez for

00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:57.903
coming from start to talk about

00:23:57.969 --> 00:23:59.404
the regulatory perspective I

00:23:59.471 --> 00:23:59.938
think this is a group and-

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:02.240
just. Have it. I want to let

00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:04.976
three messages of this morning

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:05.577
in just a few minutes first of

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:06.211
All I Want to land the message

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:06.745
that. This is not a small

00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:09.614
industry. I often people from

00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:13.718
my of traditional to believe

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:18.156
the tub blockchain encrypt.

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:25.564
Each side. We should be very

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.834
careful about what problems are

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.603
trying to solve. And then

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.173
finally I want to echo alleys

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.143
comments there is a co op unity

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.344
for California to lead. In in

00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:41.313
fact it's a little bit of a

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:41.947
travesty California which birth

00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:45.317
this industry. Leader. The

00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:48.920
little girl talk a little bit

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:49.521
about those things when you

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:50.155
start with the first point that

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:51.623
this is not a small industry so

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.427
the market cap of crypto

00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:59.197
currencies globally as. Of

00:24:59.264 --> 00:24:59.831
yesterday was brown two hundred

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:01.366
twenty five billion dollars

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:05.303
that's not a large amount to

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.239
the banking assets in the world

00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:07.839
a relic right to circulating

00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:08.373
fiat currencies but the-

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:08.974
street. To exist ten years ago

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.445
and now the- that's today. It

00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:14.112
is true that bit coin is off of

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.747
its all time high and yet bit

00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:16.348
coin alone has returned a two

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:16.882
hundred and fifty percent

00:25:16.948 --> 00:25:21.486
investment return in twenty

00:25:21.553 --> 00:25:22.554
nineteen alone. That outstrips.

00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:25.657
The next aspect by a factor of

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:30.428
roughly. Right and there about

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:31.029
two thousand crypto currency.

00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:37.168
This is not a small industry.

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:37.769
And my company is not a small

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:41.106
company so coin company.

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:41.706
Accounts that's right double

00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:42.307
the number of accounts Charles

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:46.378
Schwab to get of comparison so

00:25:46.444 --> 00:25:48.179
of for people. Over a certain

00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:50.782
age like he points a little bit

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:51.349
weird virtually. Any in the

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.585
under thirty said. Many of them

00:25:53.652 --> 00:25:56.588
have a. When they saw one we've

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:58.556
completed a hundred fifty

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:03.762
dollars of asset trades in our.

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:04.362
Seven years of existence we

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:06.031
have eight hundred four years

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:06.631
we have twenty billion dollars

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:07.866
of. I and we have a per. The US

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:11.636
Dahle. Out which is a top

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:12.237
twenty five token with four

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:14.205
hundred and seventy five

00:26:14.272 --> 00:26:14.806
million units in circulation

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:20.879
fully backed by dollar at in US

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:24.950
FDIC insured banks the point is

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:28.720
well we made. Early is we are

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:29.354
not completely mature. This is

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:32.524
not a small business. Me talk a

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:37.495
little bit about mark torture.

00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:38.096
Action in the world crypto you

00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:39.497
have to the little out where

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:40.098
this fits the sting financial

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:45.403
regulation and I begin with you

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.870
give it most financial

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:46.471
regulation is back on right

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:50.575
wing intermediaries so by.

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:51.142
Placing his large. Banks not

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:57.148
about. Tumors and so we

00:26:57.215 --> 00:26:59.084
regulate intermediaries same

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:04.189
thing is regular we largely a

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:06.224
rate issuers and. Broker

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:06.758
dealers we regulate that's

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:08.960
right. Broker dealers who you

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:15.100
from every security. What's and

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:15.667
understand in the world of

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:17.569
crypto the mission of crypto

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:20.271
technology is to remove it

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:20.839
Aries one emphasized remove

00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:25.043
intermediaries. See crypto es

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:28.813
to banks what email to the east

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.414
office right there was a time

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:34.452
when the only information to

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:35.053
other people and- go through a

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.089
single central. Pay them a lot

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:40.392
of money and we long for the-

00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:41.026
purpose of. The letter and then

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:49.701
one half. So with Val the point

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:50.335
of crypto currency ultimately

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:52.270
is by our me to try exact with

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:58.343
Allie in a way that doesn't the

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:58.910
bank doesn't touch a broker

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:01.780
dealer the mission we based

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:02.414
give these assets out into the

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.085
ecosystem so. Joint mice work.

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:08.787
But I see the. In crypto is

00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:09.421
about get rid of intermediaries

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:11.756
that's the- so having that let

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:17.295
me talk about regulatory

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:17.896
structure and the environment

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:18.463
in which we find ourselves

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.564
today the- switch the

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.833
legislature is considering.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.035
What is. This is not a light we

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:24.636
regulated industry as alley

00:28:24.702 --> 00:28:27.105
mentioned we have regulation by

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:29.774
most multiple federal

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:32.844
regulators who quite active in

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:35.180
space protect both can send

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:39.284
investors I start with this

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.784
exchange commission with

00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:42.454
delays. Which asset. In that

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:42.987
matter because yes it is a

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:47.258
secure. Closure from the asset

00:28:47.325 --> 00:28:48.960
issuers so that they understand

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:51.396
what they're buying what effort

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:52.030
the man at and T. as providing

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:54.966
and how that might rise and

00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:57.402
fall in value in the future.

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.537
The SEC also regulates changes

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:01.473
it requires that exchanges

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:05.543
provide certain protections for

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.144
people who are trading on the

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:06.678
platform to make sure the

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:09.614
assets are. Be traced can be

00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:10.148
the best execution basis.

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:12.517
Addition hold your assets to

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:13.151
make sure that the assets don't

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:18.189
go missing. One issue we have

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:21.693
today which I talk about in my

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:22.293
written submission has to do

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.394
with the clarity or lack of

00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:25.497
clarity the SEC level. And

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:26.865
there are some things the

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:28.433
commission's been very clear

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.235
about and others have been less

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:32.036
clear ample. Toto concert

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:35.507
qualify as securities. The

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:36.141
queen bass took the lead just a

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:37.108
few weeks ago establishing an

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:38.409
industry group called the creek

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:39.043
rating council. And the crypto

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:45.083
reading cancel has built score.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:45.717
To operationalize see guidance

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:47.986
and to help make clearer to.

00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:52.090
Which. Sharp black could not be

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:54.192
securities so I think Rivas.

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:56.995
You can do on that front. The

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:57.562
federal commodity if you can

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:58.663
commission also regulates other

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.665
ask crypto as does the federal

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:01.166
trade on the consumer

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:03.434
protections. In each of its

00:30:03.501 --> 00:30:05.537
agencies has a good serve

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:07.605
pursued investor protection and

00:30:07.672 --> 00:30:08.173
consumer protection issues.

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:10.108
Found them. I say this is

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:10.742
because it would be a mistake

00:30:10.808 --> 00:30:11.276
to believe that this is an

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:11.776
unregulated or lightly

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:14.045
regulated industry where people

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:16.414
are getting away with murder.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:19.184
In fact SEC announces lawsuits

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.684
against crypto project

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:21.786
developers almost weekly where

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:25.156
they see scams and they

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:25.723
purposely done where they've

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:31.529
been informed of projects in

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:32.030
cat. Values so we're not

00:30:32.096 --> 00:30:32.630
legislating in a vacuum here.

00:30:32.697 --> 00:30:34.666
At the state level the story is

00:30:34.732 --> 00:30:36.534
a little different. At the

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:37.101
state level what we have is

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.270
straight. Gold to be of

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.339
different regulation laws

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:41.940
across. Areas it's- it's have

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:46.144
money. License that. Certain

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.446
say act. This licenses the

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:54.118
governor to come like mine can

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:54.752
make margin loans to allow by

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:58.122
crypto currencies. The states

00:30:58.189 --> 00:30:58.623
have tried licenses that

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:05.597
separately gov. The opportunity.

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:06.130
In this kind of a tangled

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:12.003
regulatory climate. We would

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.537
argue a coin bass what is

00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:16.474
needed California. To lead is

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:19.611
not another later of chin on

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:20.245
top of regulation that are you

00:31:20.311 --> 00:31:23.648
this California does the

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:24.148
transmission law to have

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:24.716
banking laws and other laws

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:30.388
that of. Where California could.

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:31.556
New York state because New York

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:32.557
currently is the hub of Creek

00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:39.731
deregulation at their fourth is

00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:40.365
California could do to get the

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:40.898
industry back to this. The

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:45.036
first. Single charter which

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:48.439
which group. Major activities

00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:54.979
trading. Of those act to be

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:55.613
done cal today except each of

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.350
those requires a sprint. And

00:31:59.417 --> 00:31:59.984
licenses granted and supervised

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:03.087
by the same regular. Please

00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:03.688
supervised by the seat by the

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:08.259
by. Second New York is made the

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:11.129
mistake of issuing licenses

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:14.799
that don't our licensees to do

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:15.400
a thing. Let me just say that

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:17.502
again don't allow licensees to

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:21.439
do anything. In New York when a

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:24.642
company but license it can't

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:26.844
trade a simple crypt

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:27.445
occurrences until it sec it's

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:34.052
approval. This can be done

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:41.426
Carter. And that we're ready

00:32:41.492 --> 00:32:42.860
will I assure you drop. Yeah

00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:45.296
and my company to draw more

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:45.897
business work in the morning.

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:48.166
Find out next let. Charter and

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:51.402
next custody powers side of the-

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:55.840
to sing. In by the B. B. O.

00:32:55.907 --> 00:33:01.045
that level of clarity would

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:01.579
allow my business to move

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:04.148
faster and it would allow the.

00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:04.716
Doing so the and private so

00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:06.150
just are really. With industry

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:09.587
on these kinds of issues and I

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:10.221
am confident within the bill's

00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:11.923
existing authority things can

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:17.695
be done. Let me just say one

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:19.330
last word before I promise. I

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:19.931
will shut up that should draw

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:23.034
applause right. The virtual

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:26.437
currency this act we have

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:27.038
engage with the you're talking

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:27.605
mission over the last two or

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:28.206
three years I am pleased. This

00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:29.674
have taken some up to just. But

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:31.576
we can't believe that what is

00:33:31.642 --> 00:33:35.780
required is not a nother layer

00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:36.381
of regulation alright to pull.

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:42.019
Elation. If the legislature

00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:43.821
seriously considers act we urge

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:47.058
three things one is make sure

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:50.661
that you are already since

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:51.295
their money. In or H. some sort

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:51.929
separately require. The license

00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:56.634
under. Second to the except

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:57.101
there are collateral

00:33:57.168 --> 00:33:58.970
requirements in the in the

00:33:59.036 --> 00:33:59.570
currency business act please

00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:02.039
make sure that the collateral.

00:34:02.106 --> 00:34:02.640
Matches the one trading with.

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:13.684
Crypto trade. By fiat currency

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:14.318
for obvious quality the reasons

00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:14.819
and find me say that are

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:18.423
fundamental issue. This is act

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:19.924
idea that this thing should be

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:22.693
run article eight CC article

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.564
eight of the sea. Security not

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:29.200
securities does of the

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:29.667
securities laws so the

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:30.334
confusion that would be created.

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.336
Square peg round hole

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:35.706
securities laws will create

00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:37.542
unintended consequences both

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:39.577
for the securities market and

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:41.612
the market thanks for having

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.582
this record really appreciate

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:45.116
the- to be here. Thank you

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:49.020
Brian. But that to get to you

the committee and select

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:58.096
committee thank you for the

headquartered in San Francisco

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:06.270
we have actual products in

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:12.043
commercial you. We're working

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:13.845
with not against regulators

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:15.313
governments and central banks

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:19.884
their the world to improve the

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:22.653
way the world moves my. Rebels

00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:25.389
includes over two hundred

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:25.957
customers across forty could

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:30.528
use and so on. Rippling Jan

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:31.095
here yeah over three decades

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:33.231
practiced law in New York where

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:33.831
I was a partner with a global

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:39.303
law firm in where I held their

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:39.937
leadership positions. Accounts

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:42.273
are roles with financial

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.943
institute. In such as American

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:50.915
Express HSBC. It is our firm

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:53.084
belief having a- pourtant for

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.651
innovation in this space to

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:55.253
flourish bringing industry

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:57.688
participants consumer advocates

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.991
and regulators together as

00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:03.995
you've done today. Is precisely

00:36:04.061 --> 00:36:05.730
what is needed to reach. To

00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:08.232
that end we believe there's no

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:09.734
better place to this cop to

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.103
take place than California. As

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:15.172
the birth. And must many of the

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:15.806
start ups that at the heart of

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.542
the- every day line. Cap

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:21.946
understands well the promise

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:22.547
challenges that new technology

00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:24.382
can hold. It's recently

00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:25.983
established blockchain working

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.287
group but one ample of how

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:29.887
California is using to take a

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:31.856
leadership role and reckless

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:36.561
how to be part of that working

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:37.161
group. And this is why we are

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:38.829
so very not to sure. Given the

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:43.134
potential transit permitted

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:43.701
impact that it in these tech

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:44.268
she's. Particularly in the

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:48.506
space not only first since of

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:49.073
California but world why is

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.742
needed first days global

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.444
payment system is well off

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:55.479
taking days please. The

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.515
quickest way for me to send. To

00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:59.817
place it in a suitcase drive to

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:00.418
LA airport and physically take

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:02.320
it with me to the test. Second

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:07.491
the proper says expense.

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:11.095
Average globally currency

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:13.264
conversion fee and is equal

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:17.368
approx proximally 7% of the

00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:17.902
total amount three medic

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:18.469
finally cross border. You're

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:21.539
free to. Little communication

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.073
invisibility to either the

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:22.673
sender or the recipient of the

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.812
file. Blockchain technology and

00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:31.282
digital assets can change that

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:34.986
by enabling faster cheaper and

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:37.788
more trade and payment systems.

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:44.829
Rep net space we do what to buy.

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:48.065
Quiddity solution use virtual

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:51.869
currency called X. P. and that

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:57.975
the British to facilitate fiat.

00:37:58.042 --> 00:37:59.877
Sanctions. Partner with bank

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:01.612
financial institutions

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:02.246
including payment provide first

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:04.415
to remedy the final. Across for

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:07.485
payments. In the Civic student

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:13.324
wiretaps to displace or replace

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:13.924
fiat currency or compete with

00:38:13.991 --> 00:38:17.762
central. And the rest mention

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:18.329
report works with regulators

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:21.432
got. Banks globally to improve

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:23.534
the way the world moves money

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:24.168
so what this means California.

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:24.769
It is currently estimated that

00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:27.405
approximately eight hundred.

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:29.573
For one in nine are the

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.174
recipients of funds sent home

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:34.779
by migrant. As many of you are

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:37.848
person where California news

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:40.718
home to multiple counties were

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:43.220
migrant workers who are in any

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:48.359
in threes in from our culture

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:49.260
to technology. Comprise more

00:38:49.326 --> 00:38:51.328
third of your could stick

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:53.330
including and to Clara San

00:38:53.397 --> 00:38:55.499
Francisco. Matteo reporter

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:57.668
specific so the banks financial

00:38:57.735 --> 00:39:00.171
institutions in payment

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:00.805
providers can help immigrants

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:01.372
send money home cheaply and

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:02.707
efficiently where can then be

00:39:02.773 --> 00:39:06.010
to cover living essentials even

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:11.515
where remittances represent a

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:12.016
small portion of what a

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:15.486
migrant. These funds once. And

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:16.053
a lifeline for millions and

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:22.193
lease worldwide. To date as may

00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:22.793
invite alley and Brian neither

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.360
Congress nor US regulatory

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:24.495
agencies have established a

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:25.129
clear regulatory framework for

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:32.770
assets. The space is ripe for

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:35.473
leading states like California

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:39.076
said a workable policy that

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:41.679
would provide an example for us.

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:44.648
And regulators to follow.

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:45.249
Framework we believe it start

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:46.584
with token taxonomy a clear and

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:50.354
simple category patient of

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:51.522
tokens defining whether can is

00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:52.156
for example a since he security

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:57.495
token does the token represent

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:58.129
company is the token until the

00:39:58.195 --> 00:40:01.532
token the token right access to

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.166
color service for a reward or

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.267
is it a payments token that

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:03.834
helps bridge payments and

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:11.208
remittances. Or perhaps a

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:11.876
simple story value like to goal.

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:16.447
With that clear to content on a

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:17.281
me as a foundation the history.

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.583
Public and the regulators with

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.117
which digital and small.

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:23.687
Regular you can then figure out

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:24.288
which existing laws apply to

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:28.692
which took an asset class for

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.528
example. Which token should be

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.463
regulated under securities law

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.466
with the track. How. Asian

00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:37.434
supply how to protection laws

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:38.035
apply any to in Texarkana me

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:39.470
should retain flexibility

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:41.705
recognizing the fact that

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.674
digital assets can and do move

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.342
between classifications

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:49.446
overtime as technologies evolve

00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:51.549
taking steps along these lines

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:54.418
as the United Kingdom has

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:59.089
switch one hand Singapore have.

00:40:59.156 --> 00:40:59.723
They've all done this recently

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.492
have all done this quickly one

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:04.495
not only foster innovation and

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:08.499
protect consumers but it will

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:09.099
how California to continue to

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.869
recruit new company. And

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:14.004
promote emerging technology use

00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:16.006
that poster and as as a world

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:21.679
class destination. And will

00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:22.279
bring the jobs tax rates that

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:24.481
will follow. If that does

00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:25.115
happen there is a real risk and

00:41:25.182 --> 00:41:26.483
we're already seeing it

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.117
technology will simply move all

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:34.525
your. California has already

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:36.994
started the process of trying

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:39.530
to provide direction

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.432
introduction of a- teen eighty

00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:41.999
nine. We believe that their

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:42.566
study of legislation and any

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:45.436
amendments. Paul we need to.

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:49.640
Innovation. Thus this dialogue

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:50.241
and conversation we're having

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:50.908
today is important and again we

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:51.508
appreciate the opportunity to

00:41:51.575 --> 00:41:53.344
be part of it with you thank

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:53.944
you Sir appreciate everybody's

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:54.511
customizer removes a couple

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:55.713
questions and. Number loan if

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:59.617
you wanna start. So thank you

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.418
all for that presentation I'm

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:02.052
gonna start with a ripple in

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:03.654
queen base can you each discuss

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:07.591
the cost involved. Applying for

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:09.727
a bit license in New York and

00:42:09.793 --> 00:42:11.629
also if you can talk just a

00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:13.464
little bit about the legal

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.399
expertise that it may or may

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:16.000
not have required I'm in the

00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:19.403
process for companies. Sure

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:23.407
well so I I'm happy to start on

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:25.409
that question the answer is

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:27.678
that it took us more than

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:29.446
twelve months of time. And it

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:31.749
took us to global law firms

00:42:31.815 --> 00:42:33.450
worth of legal resources at an

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:35.486
average hourly rate of twelve

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:37.454
hundred dollars an hour. To get

00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:39.456
through that process and in in

00:42:39.523 --> 00:42:41.592
terms of the total dollar cost

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:42.126
out of pocket to service

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:43.594
providers I can't tell you that

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:45.829
other than to say it was in the

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.498
seven figures just to get the

00:42:47.564 --> 00:42:49.300
license. But I think of things

00:42:49.366 --> 00:42:49.934
not in terms of price I think

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.802
I'm of them in terms of value

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.570
for money and so it so again

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:54.171
the message I would want to

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.673
land with the committee. Is

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:57.675
that once we had spent the

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.510
millions of dollars and the

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:00.144
twelve months of time we had a

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:01.812
license that didn't allow us to

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:05.316
do anything and so the average

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:05.916
time it has taken us to get

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:07.418
approval of each individual

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:09.486
crypto token that we try to

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:11.422
trade under that license. Is

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:12.022
between three and six months

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:13.424
which means for most tokens we

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.292
add on our platform we

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:17.695
initially have to geo fence New

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:19.430
York which is our primary

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:21.565
licensing state. And only offer

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:23.434
that took in the other forty

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.068
nine states so that's a little

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:25.669
bit of a crazy model right a-

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:31.442
lot of time for no authority. I

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:32.076
saw all echo what Brian said

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:33.744
ripple I think was the second

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.279
or third. It license granted in

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:37.348
New York state I think it was

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.216
the first so first pet license

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:39.717
offered for an actual

00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:41.618
commercial use case. On the

00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:45.289
time and expense and needed. To

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:45.956
get that licenses just as Brian

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:49.393
described. Subsequent to

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.295
getting that bit license. We

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:55.332
are subject to annual audits.

00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:57.401
By the state of New York. On in

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:58.068
each of those audits come with

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:01.405
said a scaling up of

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.006
requirements of first it's a

00:44:02.072 --> 00:44:03.774
baseline of a baseline complain

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:05.642
structure. Which act which

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.311
actually in many ways is a good

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:07.845
thing you would want your

00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:11.415
company to have that. But then.

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.049
I each order brings with it a

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:13.751
new set of requirements and

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:15.753
each new set of requirements

00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:19.356
seem to be. Further removed

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:21.291
from the business. That was

00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:23.460
initial licensed in the first

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:25.496
place. So while in many ways I

00:44:25.562 --> 00:44:27.498
do. Log the department

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:29.466
financial services in New York.

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:31.568
For being the first to lean

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.237
into the space. I think over

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:33.804
the many years since the bit

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:35.739
licenses have been available.

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.574
There are a lot of lessons to

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:41.412
be learned. From the state's

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:43.547
going forward and I think if

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:45.516
the department. Of services

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:51.422
representatives. Were here.

00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:55.325
Today he said the same thing.

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:55.893
This is a follow up to that

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.761
gonna had talked a little bit

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:58.295
more about the to from law

00:44:58.362 --> 00:44:58.862
commission. Process in the

00:44:58.929 --> 00:44:59.630
third panel. Your companies

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:01.465
were involved with its with

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:03.567
that process and- do you have a

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:04.168
sense about how rigorous that

00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:05.436
process will be and- also the

00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:05.936
impact it will have to

00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:07.337
companies of different sizes

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:09.373
and I guess that that's really

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:09.973
where I'm leading to try to

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.675
understand. Not all companies

00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:13.444
are the same size they can't

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.579
all have. They don't have the

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:17.514
same resources to move forward

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:18.082
in a process like this I'm

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:19.383
trying to get a sense of how

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:23.487
realistic this will be for the

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:24.088
long range of companies that

00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:25.589
are out there in the space. Not

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:27.224
so I think that's a terrific

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.326
question and- what I would say

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.395
is the impact on companies of

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:31.995
various sizes depends on how

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:33.597
clear it is. That existing

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:37.367
licensees are exempt right so

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:37.968
at point base. We're currently

00:45:38.035 --> 00:45:41.305
licensed in forty six states

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:41.939
with existing money transmitter

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:45.409
licenses. And if it turned out

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:47.311
that we did separate we need to

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:47.945
apply for this license that I

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:49.346
would argue that states that

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:49.980
have that requirement would be

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:51.748
at a disadvantage for our

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:52.349
business because were already

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:53.684
license we have a- Trust

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.452
Company New York. License in

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:56.019
New York money transmitter

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:57.754
licenses virtually every other

00:45:57.821 --> 00:45:59.423
place. If this was an

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.592
alternative licensing path then

00:46:01.658 --> 00:46:03.594
I think the issue is a little

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.496
bit different a little bit less

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:06.130
onerous. But what I would urge

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:07.631
on the committee is. If it's an

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:09.666
alternative license there's a

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:11.368
real risk of regulatory

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:13.470
arbitrage as companies the side

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.239
mmhm do I want a money

00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:17.441
transmitter license. Or do I

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:17.975
want the virtual currency

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:19.510
business act license and that

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.445
kind of regulatory competition

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:23.480
has had issues and other

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:24.114
sectors for example in banking

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:25.616
were the thrift rate. For the

00:46:25.682 --> 00:46:27.384
weakest regulators and that's

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.051
what people want. So as I think

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:29.720
that there are pros and cons to

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:31.388
it but I think the existing

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:35.425
license fees would be concerned.

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:35.959
About the need for another

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:36.527
license to conduct the same

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:41.632
business. So the only thing I

00:46:41.698 --> 00:46:43.467
would add. I'm sherry is that.

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:44.101
I think your question gets to

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:47.337
the balance of. To the cost and

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:49.473
burden. Or the risk reward of

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.341
appropriate regulation. And

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:55.379
while I think Dân well funded

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:55.946
and mature companies like

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:59.283
windows and rebel. On can

00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.816
afford to go through that

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.618
process and Weber talking about

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:03.453
here is innovation. And I think

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.556
younger and smaller companies

00:47:05.622 --> 00:47:07.391
simply cannot on which stand.

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:09.526
The cost and the burden of

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:13.363
going through a very robust.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.997
Licensing regime which is why

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.632
much of this innovation is

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.501
moving offshore. That's why I

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:19.469
go back to the theme of a clear

00:47:19.536 --> 00:47:21.371
token taxonomy. A

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:23.507
categorization of what the

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:25.609
business is in what. Is the

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.444
very purpose of the token. I

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:29.513
think once you have a clear

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.448
token taxonomy than can look at

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:33.817
the- inventories of launch that

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:35.619
currently exist. And I think

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.187
what you will find is the

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:37.854
currently inventory of Los that

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.556
currently exist when our

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.291
probably apply to clear

00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:43.293
definitions. Suffices and you

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.729
don't actually need an

00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:47.531
additional layer of. Costly and

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:49.466
burdensome burdensome.

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:55.305
Licensing requirements. That.

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:55.906
Many simply would not be able

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:56.473
to afford to go through the

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.610
process. And Allie I just

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:00.210
wanted to see if you can chime

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.278
in specifically on the license

00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:01.812
you work with a lot of

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:03.347
entrepreneurs in the industry

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:05.282
if you can chime in. On

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:07.551
reactions to a licensing

00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:09.419
processing in California. I

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:11.555
really got into main reactions

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:13.590
so my board members already

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:15.559
have lenders licenses and are

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:16.193
in the process of a plane from

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.394
any transmitter licenses. Their

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:19.429
little aghast at the concept of

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:21.298
having to go through another

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:21.898
extremely rigorous licensing

00:48:21.965 --> 00:48:23.634
process on top of are already

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.669
very thorough money transfer

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:26.303
licensing requirements in the

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.571
state. I'm in said they were.

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:29.840
There really really hoping that

00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:31.575
they would not to later this on

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:33.310
top as has been mentioned by

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:33.844
the other panelists that

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.712
another layer of regulation it

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:37.180
would cause in these businesses

00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:37.814
to leave the state. The smaller

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:39.650
start ups and entrepreneurs

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:41.585
will not be able to attain this

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:43.487
license as currently written on

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:47.291
the- none of them have licenses

00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:47.824
in New York. It's just not

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:51.328
feasible for them financially.

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:53.563
Over the last. I would say

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.599
months I've become more

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.534
increasingly Mary to the idea

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.636
of developing a single singular

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:01.772
regulatory body specific to

00:49:01.838 --> 00:49:03.740
this interest industry in the

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:04.308
state of California because

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:05.676
when I look at what other

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:07.411
states are doing when I look at

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:09.313
the federal government is doing

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:09.913
when it comes to any business

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.383
certainty. Is paramount. And

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.819
not knowing where you need to

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:17.487
go or knowing that you need to

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:17.988
go to several different

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.489
regulatory agencies to get

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.458
approval to. To administer your

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:23.460
product or to receive any type

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:24.094
of license in order to operate

00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:25.696
your business in the state. Can

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:27.597
be extremely cumbersome and

00:49:27.664 --> 00:49:29.433
cost prohibitive and

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.535
potentially prohibited.

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:33.603
Prohibitive in any sense of

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:34.171
form whether or not they're

00:49:34.237 --> 00:49:35.372
even going to decide to. Offer

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.774
that product in the state of it

00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.409
in that particular state. I am

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:43.480
very much considering. Working

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:45.315
with this committee the

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:45.882
committee on banking finance

00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:47.384
insure là moan about creating

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:49.453
a specific regulatory agency

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:51.455
that would. Monitor and provide

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:55.359
all. The regulatory. Oversight

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:57.594
specific to this industry and

00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:59.196
so of course as a as we move

00:49:59.262 --> 00:49:59.796
through that I'd- appreciate

00:49:59.863 --> 00:50:07.337
the input. Of all of you. I got

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:07.871
a lot of. I have a lot of

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.573
questions and to see if I can.

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:13.377
Keep that. Keep it as short as

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:21.485
I possibly can. It. We have

00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:25.522
different flat. Tell tell me a

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:27.524
little bit about what it lease

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:29.426
for coin bass and ripple what

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:29.993
is the platform that you're

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.695
using to administer your

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:33.730
product I mean I've and now

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.632
there's the theory and there's

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:37.601
a couple of different platforms

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:41.605
of delivery my question is you

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.340
know we've we've seen certain

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:45.509
instances where you know we

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:47.644
talk about blockchain as being

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.312
something that is immutable but

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:49.880
yet. You know there's this

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:51.715
concern because you have mount

00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:53.450
**** coin check bit flex bit

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:57.521
finex pinpoint different

00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:59.322
instances where we've seen

00:50:59.389 --> 00:50:59.890
people that have been taken

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:03.226
advantage of either from the

00:51:03.293 --> 00:51:03.860
standpoint of raising money and

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:05.262
saying that they're offering a

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:05.862
product with that they're not

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:06.463
actually going to offer their

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.232
just stealing money to where

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:09.866
they're actually are have been

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:11.601
multiple Tokyo based companies

00:51:11.668 --> 00:51:15.705
that have been the platforms

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:18.542
that have been completely

00:51:18.608 --> 00:51:24.347
corrupted. So what are the what

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:24.915
other delivery services that

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:31.321
you guys yes. Are using. It

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:31.955
does start. Ups are at X. the

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:35.125
it'll only thank you between

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:35.725
project developers like ripple

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:41.231
and exchanges like Clinton's so.

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:41.832
As to will the more fully I'm

00:51:41.898 --> 00:51:42.466
sure ripple has a black it is a

00:51:42.532 --> 00:51:45.802
check. When bass does not quite

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.504
bass connects to double

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:48.071
different blockchain because

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:49.573
what street. We ourselves don't

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:51.374
administer one so the issue

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:51.975
with things like mount docks

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.810
had nothing to do with the

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:56.513
immutability of a blockchain it

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.113
had to do with the idea that

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:57.914
mount **** one of the earliest

00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:00.951
exchanges. Didn't have what we

00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:04.154
would consider to be a real

00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:07.424
fast or or industry standard

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:10.794
security system. One of the

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:11.561
things we often say a coin bass

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.630
and I almost hesitate. Loud

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:22.305
with cameras rolling. Largest

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:22.906
custodian the world because we

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:23.440
have a patented custody.

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:25.475
Technology that much less

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:26.076
likely that someone would be

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:27.444
able to do to us what about

00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:29.446
docs again I'm knocking on

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:31.281
whatever surfaced this this is.

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:33.750
Having having said that the

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:35.752
underlying block chains that we

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.521
connect to do have different

00:52:37.587 --> 00:52:38.121
security features and one of

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.789
the things we look at when

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:41.424
determining what the list an

00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:43.460
asset on our platform. Is a

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:45.495
security review of that block

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:45.962
chain and we deem the

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:49.399
underlying token to be T. in

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:51.301
secure that we typically don't

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:51.935
listed in fact just last week

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.837
we were looking at an asset

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.338
which is a major global asset

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:55.972
that we decline to put on the

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.641
platform for that very reason.

00:52:57.707 --> 00:52:59.476
I do want to just very quickly

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:14.291
in twenty seconds or less say

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:14.891
one thing about your opening

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:15.659
comment about the. About the

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:17.727
need for a new regulator or

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:26.536
some sort of regulatory clarity.

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:27.137
Revised by a single regulator

00:53:27.203 --> 00:53:29.973
to go to market to do Sir.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:30.974
Subject to regulation. I would

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:36.246
just caution you that the issue

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:37.847
with creating a new regulator.

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:38.381
At least one tried another

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:41.551
jurisdiction. Eight of the are

00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:42.152
looking and so I think of for

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:43.620
example see if. Was there

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:45.422
financial protection regulator.

00:53:45.488 --> 00:53:48.658
Until the FTC decided to get

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:49.192
back in that business and

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.060
compete with them sort of like

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:52.495
once. I am there was a single

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:53.129
competition regular the federal

00:53:53.196 --> 00:53:55.799
law. But now the justice

00:53:55.865 --> 00:54:01.471
department any see compete with

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:02.038
each other for jurors. Were

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:02.639
different mergers and of the

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:06.009
end of the day. I think the

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:06.576
better approach is to have a

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:08.345
Ste charter so. How do you

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:11.181
know. Prison that's the only

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:11.681
structure. But I don't.

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:16.119
Financial. Shop trying to

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:21.491
answer questions. A lawyer not

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:22.325
a cryptographer so I. Get as

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:25.261
close as it pushed to write it

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:27.030
I can't Chau rebel is a company

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:34.704
that. Two did you since they

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:35.271
can either in a way that's

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:35.972
faster cheaper more

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:40.243
transparently in the legacy

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:40.810
system which is known as the

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:45.215
swift system on one of the

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:47.917
products that. We offer can

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:48.551
lead to the last said called X.

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:52.322
or P. extra piece it's on a let.

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:57.460
The permission list Landry. The

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:58.061
coin ledger but I think that's

00:54:58.128 --> 00:54:59.829
with the latter days top a

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:03.733
repetition controller. Terpene

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.267
orders it own control the

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:09.339
lecture. Court is the big one

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:12.776
labor is based on a proof of

00:55:12.842 --> 00:55:13.810
work so when they're- and the-

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:19.049
there's a map. There's a race

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:22.552
that take off and land a

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:23.153
corporation first individual

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:25.789
who solve the math question

00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:37.067
gets rewarded in a pickle.

00:55:37.133 --> 00:55:37.667
About moving to some all proof

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:42.138
of cake meetings the more you

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:48.611
own the car you have to.

00:55:48.678 --> 00:55:49.212
Transactions on the ledger war

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:55.719
he. Which which for extra

00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:56.219
letters the verifiable

00:55:56.286 --> 00:55:57.454
corrective training caption.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.791
The X. does he prefer steak hi

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:03.760
it doesn't. There's a consensus

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:05.495
mechanism when you have 80% of

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:08.231
the participants on the ledger

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:10.667
agreed that the transaction

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:13.336
that they're seeing is the

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:13.837
correct and verifiable

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.905
transaction match the

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:18.641
transaction because that goes

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:21.144
through so if Allen this and a

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:23.513
thousand dollar do you want to

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.415
try to center twice. Centers

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:29.419
mechanism after which is to try.

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:29.986
We need to decide which of

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:30.620
those two transactions was the

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:31.421
verifiable transaction. The

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:31.988
reason the excerpted ledgers

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.623
consensus mechanism seems to

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.725
work and has never failed and

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:37.494
unlock just is Brian is

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.629
knocked. Is because all of the

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.531
petitions participants have in

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:45.401
and current common interest in

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:49.572
the integrity of the attack

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:51.474
consensus protocol in other

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:53.476
words we're not competing for a

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:55.445
bit coin rewards risk trying to

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:57.380
race to soften mathematical.

00:56:57.447 --> 00:56:59.482
Problem we're not competing to

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:01.584
earn earn or own more easily

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:05.355
can have a greater vote. We all

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:07.624
Hannah old notes on the system

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.626
have an equal vote and when 80%

00:57:09.692 --> 00:57:13.363
of those no degree it's the

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:13.863
that transaction that's

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:19.202
verified. So we hear a lot

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:21.304
about the 51% of agreement your

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:25.475
E. you require 80% so the X. RP

00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:27.377
led her into that we don't

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:29.412
order control requires 80%

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:33.616
consensus so we believe it is

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:39.322
immutable from a 51% hack which

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:39.856
bickering in the Assyrian

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:41.257
lectures have seen in the past.

00:57:41.324 --> 00:57:45.395
Thank you. And I think this.

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:47.297
For the interest of time the

00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:49.499
focus when it comes to at least

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:51.301
fourteen nine want to be doing

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:51.935
with this bill and I think the

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:53.203
state of California going to be

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:55.471
doing is and we certainly take

00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:56.105
with the uniform là commission

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.473
to put together very seriously

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.107
and are gonna go through every

00:57:58.174 --> 00:57:59.676
aspect of that to determine.

00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:01.678
You know what works for us and

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:02.278
what doesn't work for us but

00:58:02.345 --> 00:58:03.713
whatever we end up doing is can

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:04.280
be very much California is

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:05.849
going to be dependent on you

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:09.219
know. The role we want to we

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:11.754
want to serve a when it comes

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:13.323
to this new burgeoning

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.758
industry. Even though it's not

00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:17.493
so small so version because it

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:21.297
it is well established and you

00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:21.831
know come up with a very

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:25.401
California specific plan when

00:58:25.468 --> 00:58:27.337
it comes to these digital

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:28.004
currencies and how we decide to

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:29.606
regulate them and how we-

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:31.774
implement these technologies

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:35.378
and so. I think it'll be

00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:37.647
important for all of all of you

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:39.549
to continue to stay engaged in

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:40.149
this process especially as we

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:41.684
work on this bill be working

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:43.653
very closely with the committee

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.390
of that banking and finance on

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:49.325
this and so you know as a

00:58:49.392 --> 00:58:49.926
process plays out it's gonna

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:51.327
really important to have that

00:58:51.394 --> 00:58:53.463
important to have. Your

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:57.367
expertise to help us craft

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:57.967
something that is going to be

00:58:58.034 --> 00:59:01.537
not just. Not only California's

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:02.138
Pacific the revolutionary and

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:03.373
how regulation as good at and

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:04.007
how a state or any the federal

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:05.775
government any. Government has

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:07.343
gone about regulation. Of any

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.579
type of digital currencies

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:11.514
because- California we are the

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:13.516
leader and innovator when it

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.585
comes to technology. Not just

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:16.219
in this country but around the

00:59:16.286 --> 00:59:19.389
world. And I want California to

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:21.557
be. A hub and I want us to

00:59:21.624 --> 00:59:23.760
continue to be that. To be that

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:25.561
leader and I trust what we do

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:27.664
as a state. Because we are

00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:29.666
going to be more thorough. And

00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:37.573
more. And respectful of the

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.242
idea of creativity and

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.909
innovation but also at the same

00:59:39.976 --> 00:59:41.544
time focus on consumer

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:43.446
protection to make sure

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:44.080
whatever products being offered

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:45.848
to our to our citizens and to

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:47.684
our consumers in the state of

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.686
California the people that we

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:50.253
represent they're gonna be

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.489
protected and have that that

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:55.491
confidence to be able to use

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.593
these products without fear of

00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:01.564
not a without fear of. Feeling

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:02.165
like they're gonna be taking

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.533
advantage of at some point in

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:04.133
time sell your businesses are

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.370
great. And your advocacy is

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.472
amazing. I really appreciated

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:11.507
the partnership we appreciated

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:13.576
your time today but I think at

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:14.210
this point I'm organ we want to

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:14.744
our second panel thank you

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:19.248
thank you very. Thank you

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:21.384
it was great to hear kind of

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:21.985
the business and industry for

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.653
spectrum. At the next panel it

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.488
is going to focus on the

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.557
consumer perspective and I want

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:29.592
to invite to rainy right man.

majority leader Calderon it's

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:33.523
an honor to be here and I'm

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:35.691
really excited to be testifying

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:37.627
here today I represent the

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:39.629
Electronic Frontier Foundation

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.364
we're a nonprofit civil

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.366
liberties law and technology

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.334
organization we were founded in

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.703
nineteen ninety and we champion

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.505
free speech privacy and

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:51.574
innovation we have over thirty

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.876
thousand dues paying members.

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.778
The majority of the FX funding

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.613
comes from these members that's

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.549
because our mandate is to

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:01.384
represent the concerns of

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:03.319
technology users both the

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.588
technology users of today and

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:06.089
the technology users of

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:07.790
tomorrow. And the chief

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.559
programme officer the FF and

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.260
I've been writing and speaking

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:11.828
up publicly about the civil

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.663
liberties implications of

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:14.130
blockchain technology

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:15.598
regulation sense probably two

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:19.268
thousand and eleven. As you

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:19.902
start thinking about you know

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:21.838
potential regulation in this

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.639
space I won offer a few

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:24.207
thoughts to help bring that

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:29.378
conversation. First I'd- like

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:31.280
to talk about the fact that the

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:31.848
impetus behind blockchain

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:33.816
technologies is one that seeks

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:35.518
to empower consumers in

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.520
financial systems that have

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.422
historically and

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.491
systematically. Disempowered

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:42.024
them and rob them of their

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:45.461
privacy. In my role EFF I had

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:47.530
been contacted by individuals.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.465
And small businesses many times

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:51.400
over the years who have had

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.402
their financial accounts and

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.271
payment systems restricted or

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.373
shut down with little recourse.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.007
Based on the whims of banking

01:02:58.074 --> 01:03:01.344
institutions rather than the

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:03.679
execution of laws. For example

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:05.481
smashed words is one of the

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.383
world's most popular hubs for

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.452
self published authors. And

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.554
they pay all of their authors

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.456
through through pay pal and pay

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:15.791
pal shut down their entire

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:17.627
account because some of their

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:19.462
romantic fiction which to be

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:21.597
clear these are books with no

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:23.299
photos there just fiction books

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.334
was too risque for PayPal's

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.670
case. With companies like Wells

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.472
Fargo fraudulently opening

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.641
millions of accounts and

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:33.276
Equifax exposing the sensitive

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.178
data of over a hundred and

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:35.811
forty eight million Americans.

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.647
American consumers have more

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:41.817
reason than ever to be wary of

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:42.318
sharing their financial

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:45.955
information. Many blockchain

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:48.491
innovation seek to use

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:49.091
technology to protect privacy

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:51.561
in secure conceit data at a

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:52.195
keep financial information away

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:55.431
from corporations. Cannot trust.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:55.965
Well blocking technologies

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:59.268
alone cannot resolve this

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:02.371
disempowerment technological

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:07.076
advances such as blockchain may

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:07.677
well prove part of a long term

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:13.349
solution that. Consumers. I

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:13.983
think policy may be looking at

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:17.787
may blocks. As no logical

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:18.421
partner to the regulatory fight

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:18.988
to defend consumers against

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:19.488
wrongdoing by financial

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:22.158
companies. Secondly a pile so

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:27.964
I'm hoping to point out how. At

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.533
the human right to privacy and

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.634
freedom of expression are often

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.303
heavily implicated in potential

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:35.304
regulations of block allergy.

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:37.773
For example EFF has pushed back

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.374
against those laws that would

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:39.976
prevent every day. Our

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:40.543
financial transaction using

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.646
privacy coins which our tokens

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:46.482
that protect the privacy of

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:52.255
their users. We've also oppose

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:53.623
proposed. At including one

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:59.562
recently in. U. K. U. band. To

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.062
prevent consumers from

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:01.564
accessing at technology that

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:02.098
protects their individual

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.766
privacy or from publishing free

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.801
software raises a host of human

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.603
rights issues in addition to

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:09.338
being contrary to free

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.574
expression and the privacy

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:12.141
protections in trying in the

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:15.311
constitution. We've talked

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:15.945
about it a little but just to

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:17.780
overview a blockchain is a

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.715
distributed ledger it's a

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:21.484
database that stores multiple

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.419
copies of data across many

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.388
computers in a network. The

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.323
first application of blockchain

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.392
technology was bit coin. The

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:29.892
queen's promise was to

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:31.460
revolutionize value as the

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:33.396
internet revolutionized

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:35.331
information to make it possible

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:37.500
to send values across the globe

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:39.402
digitally and securely without

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:39.835
needing a bank. And

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:41.537
traditionally we know that

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.539
transferring values between

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.508
participants are required banks

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:47.643
and other third parties that

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:49.312
had to each update their own

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:49.879
ledgers so that they could

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:51.580
record a transaction. And bit

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:53.582
coin basically cuts out the

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:55.318
middle man and made it possible

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:59.322
for. As a single ledger that

01:05:59.388 --> 01:05:59.989
could be updated and maintained

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:03.459
permanently by a wide network

01:06:03.526 --> 01:06:03.926
of computers it's not

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:05.528
maintained by a single entity

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:07.596
but rather store to maintain by

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.231
computers working together.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.434
This distributed ledger is

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.369
called. A blockchain because

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:13.936
the ledger permanently and

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:15.705
secures securely stores data by

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:19.408
linking or chaining blocks of

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:19.875
data together through

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:23.346
encryption. So the big queen

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:23.979
blockchain is a record of big

01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:27.416
coin transactions but there are

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.418
many other applications at that

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:29.919
the distributed ledger

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.554
technology as the legislature

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.756
thinks about regulations it's

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.558
really important to think and

01:06:35.624 --> 01:06:36.025
recognize that future

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:39.328
innovation in the space. Might

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:39.962
have be using these distributed

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:41.597
read ledgers for purposes

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:45.234
beyond what we typically think

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:45.835
of when we think of financial

01:06:45.901 --> 01:06:50.072
services. To just offer a

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:57.012
single example for the sake of

01:06:57.079 --> 01:07:00.349
time is. Point applies là

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:02.485
technology to file storage at.

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:08.357
Huge Ben including. Tools like

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:13.329
slack it has a level for hours

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:13.996
and that is because so much of

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:15.498
the modern web at uses a single

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:17.933
service to back up and do their

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.434
file storage Amazon web

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.503
services when an Amazon data

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:21.103
center suffered an outage for

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:25.775
several hours multiple popular

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:26.242
online platforms were

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:27.443
unavailable to consumers so

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:30.379
file point sixty decentralized

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:35.751
file storage said there's no

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:36.919
single point of failure like

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:37.720
the current system that is so

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:40.189
heavily rely on Amazon. And

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:42.458
while we can't know if file

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:43.058
point or some of these other

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.261
applications of blockchain

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:49.265
ultimately be successful. Ample

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:49.799
of a black chamber correct

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:53.302
design serve consumer needs are

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:55.604
not met a modern tech companies

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:56.071
and to create a more

01:07:56.138 --> 01:08:01.410
decentralized there were more

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:05.648
resilient web. Keeping my-

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.650
interest knowledge users

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.685
especially underserved thing

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.654
tech company. From an inmate.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.589
We have a few guiding

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:14.223
principles that we put together

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.624
a to help. To help regulators

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:16.192
sort of think about how to

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:17.693
balance the needs for

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.728
innovation consumer choice and

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:23.432
consumer protection. At to

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:24.033
summarize these principles the

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:27.369
first we think that regulation

01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:27.937
should not undermine privacy

01:08:28.003 --> 01:08:29.672
enhancing innovation in this

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.674
space the right to privacy is

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.742
enshrined in the United States

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.811
constitution in international

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:37.313
human rights law and

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:39.248
California's own constitution

01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:41.717
and this state as you are well

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:43.552
aware is a leader in can

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:45.321
defending consumer privacy and

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:47.323
has been a bellwether state for

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:47.756
bringing new privacy

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:49.325
protections to consumers. And

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:51.794
we would hope that California

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.562
can continue to observe uphold

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:57.433
this consumer protections even

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.067
as it starts to think about the

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:01.437
crypto currency space. A second

01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:03.539
we- would urge that regulation

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:05.274
should not show future

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.610
innovation. At a that will

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:11.247
benefit consumers so at as has

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.682
been pointed out the blockchain

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:14.283
ecosystem is still relatively

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.718
young. There are up well

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:17.753
established companies right now

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:21.257
though that have the resources

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.359
to hire expert counsel and

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:25.261
compliance officers to navigate

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:25.895
state federal and international

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:29.598
regulations. We want to ensure

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:30.199
that these early entrants do

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:33.335
not establish themselves and

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:33.936
then pull up the ladder behind

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:37.473
them. A in the technology spear

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.475
when existing services don't

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.277
serve the needs of consumers

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:41.911
new products can come along to

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:42.478
try to give consumers better

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:45.814
choices. We want to ensure that

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.516
these new services can continue

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.718
to try to give consumers

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:51.487
choices and serve consumers and

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.556
does and that regulation

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.591
doesn't serve to merely

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:56.158
entrench the big players of

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:59.261
today. And part of that is

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.397
insuring that there are

01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:03.599
adequate on ramps for it new

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.634
services coming to market and

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:07.536
also that any regulation is

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.638
technologically neutral and

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:11.407
doesn't prioritize one

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:12.007
particular protocol or crypto

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:15.578
currency over another. A and

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:17.746
principle three a we would urge

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.615
that regulation should focus on

01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:23.285
custodial services so custodial

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:25.387
services are those entities

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:27.423
that hold and trade tokens on

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:29.525
behalf of users. And are in our

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:31.894
opinion out most likely to

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.696
abuse consumer trust in fact

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.831
they as you. At have already

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:39.268
pointed out at have a sordid

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:39.868
history of fried and sloppy

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.637
security practices not all of

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:43.539
them but some of them have.

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:45.808
Been as featured in the news

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:47.743
for this. And these are the

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:49.411
companies that we think need to

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:50.012
be held to account to ensure

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:51.513
that they don't de fraud at

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.649
consumers. So regulators could

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.618
focus their energies on those

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:59.755
bad actors and at there's youth

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:01.423
we think of the larger

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:03.392
ecosystem there's not just

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.561
between companies and blocking

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:09.531
companies. That hold as a funds

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.533
for consumers our tokens but

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.569
there's other types that maybe

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:14.203
perhaps don't hold funds that

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:15.771
man perhaps we should be a

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:17.539
little more hesitant about and

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:18.040
then there are merchants

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.642
there's miners. And there's

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:21.410
individual consumers and so

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.379
when you're thinking about

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:25.447
regulation it's important to be

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:27.349
focusing on those bad actors

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:27.950
first and foremost ensuring

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:29.685
that every day consumers and

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:31.520
everyday merchants that's just

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:32.154
a store down the street that

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:33.756
wants to start accepting crypto

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:37.326
currency. They're not the ones.

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:37.960
That are hitting the regulatory

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:43.599
burden. And then my final two

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.668
principles I'm almost done as

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:46.301
as a fourth that any regulation

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:47.302
should recognize the important

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:47.936
role of decentralized exchanges

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.371
and other decentralizing

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:49.938
technologies and empowering

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:53.275
consumers. The centralisation

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:53.842
of control creates a brittle

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:55.744
digital systems where a single

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.379
point of failure can shut down

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.481
commerce or communication. Much

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:00.082
of the strength of the modern

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.450
web comes from its

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:03.519
decentralization and many of

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:04.019
the problems we see in

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:05.554
technology space are result of

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.489
a handful of big technology

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:09.591
companies. Having undue control

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.193
over much of our digital

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:11.627
experience watching

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:13.629
technologies were built to be

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:15.698
resilient and decentralized and

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:17.466
future innovation that advances

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.702
decentralization. Including

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:20.335
decentralized exchanges should

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:23.739
be protected. And finally our

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.574
fifth principle is that

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:27.710
regulation should not punish

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:28.277
those who merely write and

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:29.578
publish code. At my

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:31.547
organization has fought to

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.682
establish and a number of

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.451
courts have recognized that

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.486
writing computer code is a form

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:39.655
of expressing ideas similar to

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:41.523
other forms of communication

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.425
like writing books. And music

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:45.327
as that's protected by the

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:47.596
first amendment. We would hope

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:49.364
that policy mage at

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:49.998
policymakers would ensure that

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:51.734
regulations aimed at blockchain

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.237
technologies do not prohibit

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:57.473
the publication or distribution

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:03.612
of code. Or otherwise require

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.380
parties to a government.

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.783
License before published. Judy

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:13.922
mayor Kurt. Bottom is very much

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:17.292
appreciated. This is an- good

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:20.729
morning thank you a Majority

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.498
Leader color and children Limon

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:23.132
for inviting me to testify here

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:25.701
today a lot of incredible new

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.503
one can meet formation already

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:29.471
been. Provide here I want to

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:31.573
just kind of take a little bit

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.141
of a step back and say okay

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:32.608
where we act on this

01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:35.611
conversation. It's an it's an

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:37.446
necessary conversation for us

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:39.615
to have. And it's a very

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:41.316
important one for us to have

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.318
given that these technologies

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:43.852
in these new products and

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:45.687
services you know represent

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:47.623
what could be you know a

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.458
dominant you know if you know

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:50.025
if could be the vanguard the

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:53.662
future of money. But it is also

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:55.497
very apparent that there are so

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:57.299
many different ways in which

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.368
virtual currencies and block

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:01.203
chain can show up in our lives.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.672
That it's not always apparent

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.874
but you can have a lot of smart

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:06.408
people in the room is not

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:07.810
always apparent to stews point

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:09.678
that people are using the same

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:11.480
terminology you're talking

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:13.415
about the same things and have

01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:15.350
the same. Priorities in mind

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:17.386
for how to approach this I'm

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:17.920
going to add a couple on

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:21.223
additional elements here that

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.692
are you know in in many ways

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.460
evergreen when her consumer

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.362
advocate which is you know you

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.598
have. A complex market place

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:31.300
here there are existing laws

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:33.635
and regulations the overlap in

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:35.604
some areas may confirm. Whether

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.673
it's how we define whatever

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.641
meal a virtual currency or

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.510
digital asset is verses you

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:43.512
know how they should be

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.681
regulated you know who should

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:51.486
bear the risk. For Los

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:52.087
reliability. At the end of the

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:55.624
day. It tends to be pretty

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:56.191
simple for consumers as end

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:57.726
users just a regular person

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:59.494
with a phone. Who just wants to

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:00.095
know if I load money into an

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.797
app. And meant to do stuff with

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.832
it I'm just gonna you know by

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.667
something ominous on my friend

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:07.469
money. Is a gonna work the way

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:09.338
it's supposed to. And if

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:11.306
something goes wrong can I fix

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:13.508
the problem. Who do I go to fix

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:15.544
that problem. And if I lost

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.412
money in a shouldn't have can I

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:19.548
get my money back. And these

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.450
kinds of evergreen really basic

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:25.420
issues are important for all of

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:26.054
us but especially important for

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:27.656
folks who are using their phone

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:31.360
as their computer as their bank

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:31.994
and maybe living paycheck to

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.562
paycheck and can't afford for a

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.364
forty dollar Venlo transaction

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.366
that goes wrong. To stay a

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:39.501
reversible you know our

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.370
organization is a national

01:15:41.436 --> 01:15:41.937
research testing an advocacy

01:15:42.004 --> 01:15:43.305
organization has worked on

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:43.872
consumer finance issues for

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:47.542
decades. We've seen you know

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:49.444
the passage of right you know

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:49.945
laws and regulations of

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.480
regulate our credit cards our

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:53.215
bank accounts or debit cards

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:53.782
more recently prepaid debit

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.751
cards now finally have federal

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:57.686
protections. Against fraud and

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.655
theft and so every time there's

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.356
a new generation on the

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:03.325
standard seem we're always

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:03.959
looking at at the end of the

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.761
day have we- addressed release

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:09.398
surfaced. These existing you

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:11.566
know evergreen issues that are

01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:12.200
going to hit consumers because

01:16:12.267 --> 01:16:13.602
in such a complex ecosystem is

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.604
this with you've got. Got

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.839
coders you have not developers

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:19.708
you know you've got let's see

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:21.443
institutions who may be using

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:23.612
ripple to move money faster.

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:24.246
You know you have business and

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:27.449
you just government and use. No

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:29.484
construed and users don't have

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:30.085
a lot of direct market place

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:31.553
power here and the power

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:35.457
information symmetry is vast.

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.058
So and even today in today's

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:37.659
world in the long for decades

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:39.728
had. Consumer protections

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:41.596
nationally for various kinds of

01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:45.334
legacy ways to pay for goods

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:45.934
and services and people don't

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:46.501
always know the difference I

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:47.102
don't know there's a different

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:47.736
law applies to your credit card

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:53.475
trend. Xin then. The one that

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:54.009
applies to your debit card

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:57.379
transaction their little.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:57.946
Different and in any case

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:59.481
people tend to expect these

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:00.048
days the whatever financial

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:00.649
service they're using. There

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:01.316
are clear rules of the road it

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:01.917
is a problem they can fix it

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:02.384
they can reverse about

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:03.452
transaction get their money

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:04.052
back. And I can't sitting here

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:07.489
today. Tell you know how many

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:07.990
of the offerings of the

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:09.624
providers of virtual currencies

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.626
our platforms are going to be

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:13.762
guaranteeing those same kinds

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.330
of protections some may

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:17.232
voluntarily do so some may not.

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:19.401
And so that's the challenge

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:20.002
that we all face here but I

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:21.403
think the main take away. I'm

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.070
other than your service in the

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:25.240
fact that there are. Novel

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:25.841
questions of one policy but

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:27.909
they're also unsolved existing

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.244
questions of one policy that

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:29.745
always come up. I'm for

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:31.613
consumers when technology at

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.482
your moves faster and then the

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:35.550
laws and regulations is to say

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:37.452
that's- stakeholder engagement

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:39.388
like this. Is absolutely

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:41.690
essential I think that we all

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:42.324
want to make sure we're having

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:43.425
the same conversation. It's the

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.026
right conversation and of the

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:45.961
right people are at the table.

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:47.696
Are because there's a lot to

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:49.398
take in here and understands

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:51.466
that we can be. Speaking the

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.235
same language and speaking of

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:53.802
fluently as we think about

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:55.537
regulatory approaches here

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:57.239
there are some areas where.

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:59.408
California as a state

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:00.042
government you know could look

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:01.777
at some of its licensing of

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.512
supervision. And enforcement

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:05.680
you know at a sororities are

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:09.051
but some of this is also quite

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:12.020
frankly gonna go beyond

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:15.524
California. I think that as

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:16.091
we're looking at regulatory

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:19.828
approaches we need. In about

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:20.362
what can we do through the

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:23.265
state regulation. To coordinate

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:23.899
with other government agencies

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:24.533
this guy at the need to because

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:27.035
in coordination with the

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:27.669
federal government as well as

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:29.604
they are looking to. Solve some

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:30.138
of these problems in the

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:31.973
federal reserve for those who

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:35.343
don't know is finally moving

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:38.013
forward. With building out a

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.848
new real time payment. I'm just

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:40.449
our existing king system which

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:43.785
is on. Long as into slow at

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:48.990
moving money as well. To clear

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:49.591
for example I and now they're

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:52.260
even bipartisan calls because

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:52.861
of Facebook and we were there

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.296
bipartisan calls I'm coming

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:54.896
from Congress to the feds in

01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:56.832
maybe the food and help our

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:57.432
virtual. And see so there's a

01:18:57.499 --> 01:19:02.704
lot of activity. Partisan. At

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:05.440
the national level as hearing

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:05.941
yeah so what particular

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:09.544
advocating. Order which is

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:12.914
thank that remember we just.

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:13.482
The novel policy questions

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:17.085
verses the pre existing policy

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:17.719
questions we need answered when

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:18.186
it comes to protecting

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:20.555
consumers who purchase funds

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:21.156
are being used in with these

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:21.957
products I and then also make

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:25.460
sure the convening stakeholders

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:26.061
and I think it's of essential

01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:28.196
consumer. Advocate we have. A

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:33.435
room. Asians and they are

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:36.138
always in the room a reserve.

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:38.507
In other work groups some very

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:39.074
very heartened that we were

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:39.708
invited today and the consumer

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:42.444
protection perspective was

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:45.280
given room to. Presented I

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:47.849
think that's going to wear this

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:50.185
can affect all one way or

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:52.821
another as the ten part.

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:53.421
Campaign estimates that arm in

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:55.157
the direction. Products and

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:55.724
services take so thank you

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:56.324
again some for the opportunity

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:57.259
to testify today. Great thank

01:19:57.325 --> 01:20:05.534
you. The rainy. We thought of

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.470
it about the relationship block

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:12.674
and gonna come in January one

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:15.610
twenty twenty with the CPA.

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:25.520
Actions. That is great. As is

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:27.322
so we have I guess the longer

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:34.229
each year to that is. I have a

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:35.897
band state legislative team and

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:39.267
if you would like us to. I do

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:44.172
assisting kind. That I'm happy

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:46.341
to. I haven't been working on

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:48.310
the C. C. P. a and so I hate to

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:51.246
step a in general he to sit to

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:51.813
imagine things I don't know

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:52.447
that much about but I would be

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.749
particularly low to step on

01:20:54.816 --> 01:21:00.722
their toes. I do know that

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.891
there are a lot of questions at

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:07.495
out at about in box chains this

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:12.000
is where you. Can't be here

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:15.170
question out. Of the box. For

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:15.737
example under GPR you might

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:17.739
want to see removed and that's

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:18.240
just an outstanding. The

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:19.407
question that I don't think is

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:22.410
the been resolved yet at least

01:21:22.477 --> 01:21:23.178
nine I'm- not. A for the most

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:26.314
part I have. Where you see

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:29.517
block chains to store. His

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:31.486
entrance rather than a what we-

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:35.557
this content. At messages and

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:40.662
so I feel like to be at that is

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:41.196
not entirely true there's

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:41.763
different. Ways that you can

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.498
use. Today that would

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:47.302
communicate messages I think. A

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:49.504
some a so that that's the only

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:50.105
question I really dived into a

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:51.273
little bit more than that. Do

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:51.806
you have thoughts on that

01:21:51.873 --> 01:21:57.612
question. What in just for

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.581
those or not sure what's easy

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.283
PACC P. is a Calvary consumer

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:01.750
privacy act that the

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:03.418
legislature passed to give

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:04.019
consumers about more control

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:07.555
over there over their

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:09.524
information more than they've

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:10.058
ever had in the past the

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:11.726
requested take information down

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.628
or not have information shared

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.563
or Ste the war sold. In ways

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:16.097
that they don't want that

01:22:16.164 --> 01:22:17.532
information shared or sold and

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:19.768
sell that's something that we

01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:21.403
are we're gonna be having come

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:23.505
in fact in January one twenty

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:24.172
twenty and I'll only reason why

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.774
I ask is when you take a look

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.342
of watching technologies

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:27.942
they're two different schools

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:29.444
of thought it's the most

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:30.045
transparent. I which is a good

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.379
thing but that all some say

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.415
it's the most secure because

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:34.015
you have privately in a public

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:37.719
key ad in the public he

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:38.286
identifies you but then the

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:39.688
private key something that you

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:41.623
keep to yourself and the

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:43.291
supposed to be private to you.

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:45.493
And so when there's when you're

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:45.994
when you're working on

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:47.495
blockchain you're dealing a

01:22:47.562 --> 01:22:48.063
blockchain make transaction

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:51.666
this. Is information that

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:56.271
anybody can see. Now anybody

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:56.905
can see is important because of

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:57.539
the transparency make sure. You

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:59.474
can. Verify the validity of the

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:02.077
transaction but also at the

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.545
same time do I want. To be able

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:05.313
to see. That I made a specific

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:09.150
transaction Mullin I mean Sir.

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:09.784
Criminal I don't want people to

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:13.188
seize stern track. But if I.

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:13.722
Certain medications or the

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:16.224
things. If my employer can see

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:19.327
that in and or or prospective

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:22.530
employer can see that could

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:23.164
they use that against me when I

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:23.698
was the hiring process of

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:26.701
something else. So I'm just

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:28.937
curious to see the real at.

01:23:29.003 --> 01:23:30.438
Least in California that's

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:32.173
gonna develop between change

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:37.579
and the CCP a. To consumers

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:39.681
more control of their own

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:40.248
personal information at the

01:23:40.315 --> 01:23:45.387
same time how. That have that

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:45.954
control the regulation. Well

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:46.521
one thing I think that's a

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:47.522
really good point and one of

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:49.624
the things that is really

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.225
interesting in the blockchain

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:51.726
spaces were seen the rise of

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:53.428
privacy points which I

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:54.062
mentioned so those are things

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:55.597
like Minero and see cash in

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:57.665
these are tools that so the

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.267
traditional blockchain as-

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.603
ecosystem as you mentioned it's

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:03.538
pseudonymous so it's not

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:05.440
associated with your name but

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:06.074
it is associated with basically

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:07.709
an account number so that. If

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:09.477
it ever got connected back to

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:11.346
you all of your prior

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:11.813
transactions that were

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.314
associated with that

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:13.915
pseudonymous account would be

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:17.318
kind of visible in public I've

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:21.656
had it compared to the way. You

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.658
know. The stock market is not

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.760
it's public but you don't you

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:26.394
know that's all under kind of.

01:24:26.461 --> 01:24:29.330
Little acronyms so. With

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.299
privacy coins you've got coins

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:33.501
that protects the-

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:35.370
transactional information so

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:37.639
the account it's being sent to

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:39.340
and from and the amount that's

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:41.376
beans. And is still able to

01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:43.445
verify things so to me this is

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:45.413
a really interesting and

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.449
exciting area of animation.

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.517
It's not widespread right now

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.586
in its use and I would you know

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:53.688
echo what you said there's a

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:54.289
lot of reasons that everyday

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:55.757
people who were doing nothing

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.425
wrong care a lot about their

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.561
financial privacy. I personally

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:00.161
care a lot about my financial

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:01.629
privacy if I have to pick up

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:03.698
medication or something I do

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.500
choose to do it in cash I don't

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:07.535
sign up for like. The CVS of

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.637
rewards program that requires

01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:13.308
my phone number. And I. I

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:17.378
deeply sympathize with our need

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:19.280
to go after bad actors who

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:23.451
might be using funds in ways to

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:25.420
basically. Find their bad

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:27.822
activities. But my purpose here

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.657
is to stand up for everyday

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:31.326
people who aren't doing

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:31.926
anything wrong who still want

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:33.628
their privacy and making sure

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:35.763
that in our- attempt sick. You

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.932
to go after these bad actors we

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:39.701
don't accidentally prevent

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.503
everyday consumers from using.

01:25:41.569 --> 01:25:43.371
Privacy points and things of

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:44.005
that nature I think it's gonna

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.473
be interesting to see this

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:45.974
conversation between the

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.642
centralization centralization.

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:49.511
I continue to of all because I

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.346
think. The idea originally

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:55.283
behind blockchain the

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.884
decentralization was a little

01:25:55.950 --> 01:26:01.689
more. A libertarian anarchists

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:02.323
and in its in its inception of

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:03.558
you know I don't want the

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:04.158
government. Knowing or having

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:05.393
any control or any institution

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.027
have any control over anything

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:06.494
that I do I want to be

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:07.061
completely a Thomas I think

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:07.662
that there's a lot of people.

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:08.296
That would share that sentiment

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:09.430
maybe not the anarchy said

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:11.466
about sentiment but- aren't

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:12.100
missions as is the libertarian

01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:13.701
side of that sentiment but the-

01:26:13.768 --> 01:26:15.670
but the idea that I have more

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:17.338
control over my own information

01:26:17.405 --> 01:26:19.407
and my own. Finance finances

01:26:19.474 --> 01:26:21.242
rather than having to always

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:21.743
deal with some type of

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:23.645
intermediary an intermediary

01:26:23.711 --> 01:26:25.346
every time I make a transaction

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:27.248
with they they they charge me.

01:26:27.315 --> 01:26:27.882
A fee to make that transaction

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:29.717
and so I think there's a lot

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.219
that's going to be discovered

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:33.354
but I just don't. I don't see

01:26:33.421 --> 01:26:33.922
at I find it. I think it's

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:35.356
going to be difficult to move

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:37.759
to a more decentralized. System

01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:39.627
without finding a way to

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:43.231
implement this technology and

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:45.433
blockchain and centralized

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.468
manners to centralize ways with

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:49.404
the with the center with a

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:51.439
centralized administrator. At

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:51.973
because a big part of the

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.508
problem is that you have a lot

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:59.280
of folks that. Have no idea

01:26:59.347 --> 01:26:59.847
what blockchain is when I'd

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:00.415
when I when I authored the

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:04.719
legislation. About creating the

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:12.293
blotching working group. Yeah I

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:12.860
don't know what this is all

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:13.428
rescue but you know what you

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:18.733
your- in the- heard watching I

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.367
don't know what that even means

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:19.934
I and you know when you're

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:20.568
dealing with let us listen our

01:27:20.635 --> 01:27:21.202
stay there in with two thousand

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:23.471
issues in a given year yeah

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.072
there might not be that time.

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:27.775
To complete. Really understand

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:28.376
what that is and so you were a

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:28.943
lot of different legislators

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:33.648
have expertise is. Two other

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:34.148
legislation in your own

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:34.716
research based on. Never is

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:38.853
trying. Present to you in terms

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.889
policy but- you know I think

01:27:41.956 --> 01:27:46.894
that. We want. A lot of the

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:50.598
stuff out. To have this to her

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:52.200
side the equation always. Bob

01:27:52.266 --> 01:27:56.604
press there because it seems to

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:57.238
get caught up in the excitement

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:58.239
of a lot of it. But there's a

01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:03.211
catch to our decisions that

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:03.845
we're gonna making a lot of

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:05.580
people. Apple and if it

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:09.951
eventually be harmed whatever

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:16.357
we choose to rate. Played.

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:16.958
Thank you for being here if I

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.226
could just response. I mean at

01:28:18.292 --> 01:28:25.366
I think the- date to San made

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:25.967
this really good point. A lot

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:26.534
of the a lot of the people

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:27.068
interacting with the chain

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:27.535
ecosystem today. Are

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:28.102
interacting with it the way

01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:30.571
similar to how they were. King

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:33.307
with. King institution passed.

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:33.875
You're dealing with a studio

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:39.914
services. On behalf. People. I

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.582
believe the first panel argued

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:42.150
thoroughly regulated already

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:43.651
but I would argue are the most

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:45.653
likely to and really on a-

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.457
practices. Because they have.

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:50.124
Out of whack you are right that

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:51.693
right now the initial idea of

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:53.761
blockchain is not like people

01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:55.797
are not one to wine interacting

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:57.465
and totally cutting out

01:28:57.532 --> 01:29:04.205
centralizing entities. The way

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:04.772
perhaps the originators of

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:09.744
watching had hoped. Days we

01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.746
actually have no idea what is

01:29:11.813 --> 01:29:15.283
look like twenty sure now and

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:15.883
there's a lot of really being

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.385
new patients going to make it

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:18.019
much much easier. For people to

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:19.420
do person the person. And so I

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:23.991
went whatever. Today doesn't

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:24.492
prevent those kind of

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:27.361
interesting new more consumer

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:31.332
and brain tools from of being

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:35.503
Burke tomorrow. I think you may

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:36.104
questions thank you and I will

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:39.407
close just one question. I know

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:40.007
we still haven't at an all you

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:45.413
can. Asians I mean are

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.047
California regulators can only

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:49.117
start. A so many new programs

01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:49.751
and focus on so many new things

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:53.521
and clearly there's a lot. The

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:55.423
space space is this fall a list.

01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.990
Musicians in terms of things

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:56.491
that the state should be

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:57.625
thinking about. Yeah I think

01:29:57.692 --> 01:30:00.027
it's fair to say for Consumer

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:01.496
Reports that are for focus on

01:30:01.562 --> 01:30:03.531
sort of emerging emerging pays

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:05.366
me to say merging payments I

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:05.933
mean really like emerging

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.502
financial technologies as big

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:08.169
as a core part of our financial

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:11.606
policy teams work. There are a

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:13.641
lot of non profits out there

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:15.476
that focus on a lot of aspects

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:17.478
of consumer finance I think a

01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:18.112
lot of people are rightly very

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:19.280
much focused on consumer

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:21.349
lending and cleaning up some of

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:21.949
the things that took a long

01:30:22.016 --> 01:30:23.651
time for us to address to begin

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.286
with. Kind of isn't it true

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:27.288
traditional banking and lending

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:29.423
spaces but there is I think

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:31.659
there are more advocates are

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:33.394
starting to look into this but

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:33.995
I think it's fair to say that

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:35.596
in many respects a lot of fun.

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:37.365
Also a lot of sources of

01:30:37.431 --> 01:30:37.965
funding for nonprofits to do

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:41.369
advocacy work tend to focus on

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:43.371
maybe things that seem more

01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:45.506
tangible around income support

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:47.341
or criminal just comparable

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:47.942
justice Gration like life or

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.877
death the supposedly seems life

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.779
or death. And I think what we

01:30:51.846 --> 01:30:53.614
try to do as an organization of

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.650
prioritize is financial policy

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:57.351
from a consumer protection

01:30:57.418 --> 01:30:57.985
perspectives to point out that

01:30:58.052 --> 01:31:01.756
people. Here in California and

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:05.459
around the country are. So many

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:05.960
of them are struggling

01:31:06.027 --> 01:31:07.662
financially and it is impacting

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.597
their lives in ways that could

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:10.164
just be on what's in their

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:11.499
wallet and that this this.

01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:12.099
These kinds of. Is kinds of

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:13.668
issues can really make an

01:31:13.734 --> 01:31:15.469
impact your physical health and

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:17.438
so we is always want to make

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:17.972
sure that. Where they were

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:18.573
looking at something that's

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:19.574
emerging or trying to. It you

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.542
know and improve a long

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:23.578
standing existing policy issue

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:25.446
that that these financial

01:31:25.513 --> 01:31:26.080
issues are seen as an economic

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:29.383
justice issues. That that. On

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:30.051
the impact everybody because we

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:31.886
all use money but and then of

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:33.688
course we must remember. That

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:35.423
whenever there is a problem or

01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:36.023
a gap in protections it will

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:37.291
always disproportionately

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:39.560
impact. Those who can least

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:41.762
afford to lose their precious

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:45.466
funds to araneus transaction.

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:46.033
Thank you this is also very

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:49.403
interesting question. I really

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.004
enjoyed all these questions I

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.606
would say you know it's an

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:55.309
interesting time because. You

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:55.943
know it even three years ago I

01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:57.812
thought this was absolutely the

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.447
wrong time to try to do any

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:01.382
regulation in this space other

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:03.384
than you know what was already

01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:05.286
kind of in place because that.

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:05.853
The ecosystem is moving so

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.290
quickly and- I certainly don't

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:09.924
necessarily feel strongly about

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:11.559
that now I can see there's

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:13.661
things have evolved to the

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:15.363
point that you've got companies

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:15.930
of this size of queen based

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:17.565
like there are established

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.400
companies that. It makes sense

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:21.335
to regulate that so I

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:21.936
completely sympathize and if

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:23.571
this is the time that

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:25.306
California government decides

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:25.873
it wants the get involved in

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.477
the space you know I can

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:33.481
understand that. That said a if

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:35.383
you decided not work on a bill

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:37.418
this year and put it off for a

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.052
year I think that would also be

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:43.658
okay. And as far as how it

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:47.528
pulls in our priorities a. I

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:48.095
think there's this big fear

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:49.563
that. Lack of regulatory

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:51.499
certainty creates makes it

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:53.367
really different difficult for

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:53.935
blocking companies to figure

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.770
out where they can be and what

01:32:55.836 --> 01:32:57.571
they can do and it pushes them

01:32:57.638 --> 01:33:01.375
out of the area. But. A very

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:03.611
poorly written law that affects

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.713
a consumer's in ways that we

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.448
didn't realize or intend. Is it

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:09.216
is much worse than that right

01:33:09.283 --> 01:33:11.385
in my opinion and so taking the

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:11.953
time to do it rates which I

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.754
believe this process has been

01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:15.690
incredibly inclusive and I a

01:33:15.756 --> 01:33:19.226
applauded. Is more important

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:19.727
than trying to just get

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:21.462
something out there. Yes I've

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:23.631
works globally we have a lot of

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:25.333
different issues and we also

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:27.401
work on the federal level and

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:29.370
in California on a wide range

01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:30.037
of issues so we are definitely

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:32.807
engaged. But I would say you

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:36.077
know we're really working on.

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:40.748
Surveillance encryption issues

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:41.382
are sort of one of our top. And

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:45.353
double speech issue. Thank you.

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:46.887

knowledge as a- teacher might

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.920
consider. What. Provide I will

plans for virtual currency

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:43.330
fraud. When the department

01:36:43.397 --> 01:36:43.931
received complaints regarding

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:50.371

education spending and the

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:07.721
departments and four division

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:08.222
and year to date twenty

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:08.756
nineteen the department is

received. Teen of which are

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:11.992
against the same range for

01:37:12.059 --> 01:37:15.462
researchers. Past three years

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:16.096
the number the department has

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:16.697
reached about ritual currency

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:18.065
has fluctuated. Generally

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:19.867
speaking complaints come in

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:22.970
waves based on the forgery some

01:37:23.037 --> 01:37:30.211
well known see such as corn and

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:33.847
the related customer demand.

Sixty complaints. To virtual

currency so which. I'm a

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:43.457
processing of transactions.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:44.091
That surgeon complaints appear

01:37:44.158 --> 01:37:45.326
again appear to be related to

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:45.993
the sharp run up and demand for

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.128
virtual currency around this

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:50.364
time last year. Again which

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:50.998
seem to impact customer service

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:56.170
response. But with respect to

01:37:56.237 --> 01:38:00.674
the particular comply the

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:01.175
department did not have

01:38:01.242 --> 01:38:03.077
jurisdiction take action in

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:07.014
many cases because- service or

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:09.883
good and later to a nation of

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:12.920
security. Other laws. Overseas

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:13.387
in twenty fifteen the

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:13.954
department it desist inner

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:14.655
frame order against a company

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:18.292
called US investment arts Inc

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:22.129
and three of the firms it is

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:22.596
urging that they sold

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:25.766
securities without a Christian

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:26.267
and misled investors. In

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:29.803
selling the securities. That

01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:32.039
order requires US hi I a

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:36.810
officers stopper the violation.

01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:37.444
Me is based in Arcadia and did

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:38.045
a multi level marketing so the

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:44.151
prop master. Money Gen coin.

01:38:44.218 --> 01:38:48.989
TVO entered into settlement

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:49.556
with the opening in December

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:50.090
twenty eighteen or by the

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:53.861
agreed to stipulate to a- it

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:56.497
was estimated that my. The

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:59.767
department may have

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:06.540
jurisdiction over a virtual

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:08.208
operation if what our

01:39:08.275 --> 01:39:08.776
securities laws it is being

01:39:08.842 --> 01:39:10.210
violated for instance hello

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:16.216
asset. Thirty if is if. Digital

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:17.318
assets will gain và on the

01:39:17.384 --> 01:39:21.255
part profit in the future.

01:39:21.322 --> 01:39:23.757
Another example. Of a sham

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:31.765
crypto currency. If said and

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:34.134
tell the customer the combined

01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:34.735
and on the side in fact they

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.203
don't sell bitcoin on the way.

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:39.940
That the cell. Actually when

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:40.574
complaints are received related

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:41.175
to conserve customer service

01:39:41.241 --> 01:39:44.578
issues or delays in processing

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:45.179
transactions where there is no

01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:47.381
one to defraud. We may refer.

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:49.450
It's the California attorney

01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:50.050
general's office consumer law

01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:51.752
action for you of deceptive

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:53.687
practices. Commodities laws but

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:54.254
we have no evidence that the

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:54.722
company is acting in

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:57.758
California. Then that may be

01:39:57.825 --> 01:40:00.928
referred over to the securities

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:01.528
exchange commission or the U.

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:01.995

commission. Number two and St

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:12.539
Los. Yeah the department has

01:40:12.606 --> 01:40:15.442
not turned. In a the part the

money transmission act. Or

01:40:23.884 --> 01:40:24.385
other related laws under the

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:24.985

the my transmission act the

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:41.368
requirement would need include

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:44.605
the virtual currency some sort

01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:54.014
of monetary và. It's possible

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:54.648
that some transactions may fall

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:55.282
under the. Virtual currency to

01:40:55.349 --> 01:41:02.256

Online wall a secure

01:41:02.756 --> 01:41:03.257
environment for long term.

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:08.061
Nancy we're not too many other

01:41:08.128 --> 01:41:11.265
activities related. To that

01:41:11.331 --> 01:41:16.470
kind of crap currency and a

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:25.379
more concrete analysis. Whether.

01:41:25.446 --> 01:41:25.979
Whether in fact there Sen how

01:41:26.046 --> 01:41:30.984
to close those gaps. Number

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:34.455
three separate Tory. Eighteen

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:38.625
perceived twenty request from

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:39.226
virtual currency businesses.

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:40.327
Tory clarity. Question thirty

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:44.431
five of those are still pending.

01:41:44.498 --> 01:41:46.500
If the department identified as

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:48.268
an out of the business the

01:41:48.335 --> 01:41:57.711
also. Under. We would provide

01:41:57.778 --> 01:41:58.212
written guidance to the

01:41:58.278 --> 01:41:58.779
requester about the need for

01:41:58.846 --> 01:41:59.279
less. This plan does not

01:41:59.346 --> 01:42:04.551
include. Xin we generally issue

01:42:04.618 --> 01:42:06.019
a lot. Lester and for that the

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:06.653
business model does not appear

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.990
to require licensure at this

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:12.226
time that the department use

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:16.396
the study of. American. Written

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:19.466

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:20.701
this proprietary information

01:42:20.767 --> 01:42:23.003
and then Paul on site. Said on

virtual currency such as three

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:38.652
big coin ATM. A risk is are

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.921
generally issued the cabbie out

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.122
this is an evolving area of law

01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:43.757
and the departments in the

01:42:43.824 --> 01:42:46.093
subject to change. At any time.

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:46.593
Number four uniform là

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:49.763
commissions model regular.

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.665
Twenty seven in the form law

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:52.132
commission created the

01:42:52.199 --> 01:42:52.699
uniformed elation a virtual

01:42:52.766 --> 01:42:55.068

01:42:55.135 --> 01:42:56.370
license businesses that.

01:42:56.436 --> 01:42:58.639
Currencies for cash. Brother

performs historial duties.

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:15.622
Model act is not propose

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:16.256
repeating for itself for owners

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:21.695
of. Model presents some. And

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:24.431
could provide certainty

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:24.998
regarding what entities and

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:25.599
activities are covered or not

01:43:25.666 --> 01:43:28.302
covered. The drive to promote

01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:31.405
innovation as a registration

01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:34.374
option for lower ball of fur

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:34.975
và falling virtual currency

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:38.345
activity. Is the type of is

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:38.946
approach that I could be part

01:43:39.012 --> 01:43:41.081
of a start up companies. The

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:44.384
department does broken.

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:44.985
Questions framework. Any rate

01:43:45.052 --> 01:43:50.490
three structure. Must be

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:51.058
tailored California's summer

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:52.426
protection needs. One example

01:43:52.492 --> 01:43:53.527
the minimum net worth

01:43:53.594 --> 01:43:55.596
requirement of twenty five

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:57.698
thousand dollars the commission

01:43:57.764 --> 01:44:01.802
commission framework. Across

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:04.371
the board as a quick compared.

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:04.905
Money transmitters must

01:44:04.972 --> 01:44:05.539
maintain tangible shareholder's

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:06.039
equity of at least fifty

01:44:06.106 --> 01:44:07.574
thousand dollars depending on

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:09.910
the size. Second this

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:12.713
regulatory framework hasn't

01:44:12.779 --> 01:44:13.280
been it did by any state and

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:15.515
therefore is untested which

01:44:15.582 --> 01:44:17.351
really makes it difficult to

01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:19.219
anticipate how regulation.

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:19.820
Effect the virtual industry or

01:44:19.886 --> 01:44:23.790
consumers. Lastly the verge the

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:30.964
end. Allow. As you sit here

01:44:31.031 --> 01:44:31.565
today may be outdated or soon

01:44:31.632 --> 01:44:35.636
become outdated. That said we

01:44:35.702 --> 01:44:36.236
do believe that the unit from

01:44:36.303 --> 01:44:37.638
law commission models are

01:44:37.704 --> 01:44:39.539
starting for it for

01:44:39.606 --> 01:44:40.107
conversation the regulatory

01:44:40.173 --> 01:44:41.541
framework. To focus on the

01:44:41.608 --> 01:44:43.610
opportunities that we have to

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:44.277
harmonize some of our existing

01:44:44.344 --> 01:44:45.879
laws and regulations so is to

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:47.748
leverage the good work that the

01:44:47.814 --> 01:44:51.918
department is already doing.

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:53.420
Finally topic area number five

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:53.987
policy trade off some input

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:57.290
implementation challenges. A

01:44:57.357 --> 01:44:59.526
predictable and scalable

01:44:59.593 --> 01:45:00.027
regulatory framework for

01:45:00.093 --> 01:45:01.695
virtual currency would pose

01:45:01.762 --> 01:45:03.397
benefits to all stakeholders in

01:45:03.463 --> 01:45:13.306
California from consumers and

01:45:13.373 --> 01:45:15.475
investors. To the company's on

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:16.043
down to the department as a

01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:22.015
regulator. Mr knowing their-

01:45:22.082 --> 01:45:22.616
and are regulated businesses

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:25.886
would benefit by focusing.

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:28.355
Collective efforts pourtant

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:30.857
work complying with the

01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:33.660
predictable set of Tatian.

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:40.133
Other than crafting. Through

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:48.108
all. SB some challenge as it

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:50.377
stands today the department has

01:45:50.444 --> 01:45:51.011
already observed several risks

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:57.684
associated virtual currency.

01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:58.285
Some complaints again we have

01:45:58.351 --> 01:46:01.755
received. Five areas

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:06.393
implementation budget. There

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:07.027
are other five Lee permission

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:09.796
pernicious reduce the need to

01:46:09.863 --> 01:46:13.500
be Medicare and such risks

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:14.000
could include bad actors

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:18.905
funding with customer deposits.

01:46:18.972 --> 01:46:20.107
Lack of appropriate

01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:21.074
cybersecurity systems prevent

01:46:21.141 --> 01:46:24.077
of customer funds black.

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:26.012
Continuity planning to also

01:46:26.079 --> 01:46:26.580
persons who hold blocks and

01:46:26.646 --> 01:46:31.218
that company assets. You were

01:46:31.284 --> 01:46:31.818
tension undisclosed fees taken

01:46:31.885 --> 01:46:36.823
their investors. Encouraging

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:37.390
news I think the encouraging

01:46:37.457 --> 01:46:40.927
news and such for. Our at all

01:46:40.994 --> 01:46:41.928
arts although all and the

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:42.496
department has for some time

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:44.331
been addressing Ste. St

01:46:44.397 --> 01:46:48.268
products the case of this. I

01:46:48.335 --> 01:46:51.638
think the balance. So

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:53.640
restrictive or priest give

01:46:53.707 --> 01:46:58.311
stressed and it apparently

01:46:58.378 --> 01:46:58.945
stifled emerging technology in

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:00.614
industry out of California. But

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:06.086
not so hands off Aston bridges

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:06.686
straighten actors that would

01:47:06.753 --> 01:47:07.187
take an inch of for the

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:10.223
consumer. Esther's it's also

01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:10.824
important to the ways in which

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:12.793
kallus. Exist today might be

01:47:12.859 --> 01:47:23.537
hope so. There are merging

01:47:23.603 --> 01:47:24.137
treason knowledges as such. I

01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:24.771
would prop. Creating a sensible

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:30.510
for. Around a new age around

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:31.144
three. The focus should be on

01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:31.711
defining the industry itself

01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:32.712
first principles basis. What

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:33.346
are those distinct products and

01:47:33.413 --> 01:47:36.783
services that comprise it.

01:47:36.850 --> 01:47:37.384
Water the attendant risks of

01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:41.955
each type product or service.

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:42.589
How could each attendant risk

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:44.758
or be addressed to three

01:47:44.825 --> 01:47:47.527
existing regulations. For

01:47:47.594 --> 01:47:49.296
example the features of an

01:47:49.362 --> 01:47:51.898
initial coin offering roughly

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:52.399
speaking a method of cap

01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:56.536
mission through. The asset the

01:47:56.603 --> 01:47:57.137
tech features risks that type

01:47:57.204 --> 01:48:03.944
product in not be the same as

01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:04.611
those of a stable and which is

01:48:04.678 --> 01:48:05.178
itself pay cable currency or

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:09.883
other assets. After the

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:11.351
industry products the comprises

01:48:11.418 --> 01:48:14.154
cogent defined we might the

01:48:14.221 --> 01:48:15.956
crew. Testing existing laws and.

01:48:16.022 --> 01:48:17.924
Help identify legal right for

01:48:17.991 --> 01:48:20.760
gas but are tailored to the

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:23.830
risks that again type of crypto

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:24.431
currencies post to cal tumors

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:30.637
and stirs. Close again would

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:31.271
like to thank the good for the

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:33.440
opportunity to discuss the

01:48:33.506 --> 01:48:36.476
opportunities challenges that

01:48:36.543 --> 01:48:36.910
the department seize

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:39.713
cryptocurrency industry. Some

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.748
the end of tape the end. Course

01:48:41.815 --> 01:48:44.317
has been born in California

01:48:44.384 --> 01:48:44.851
many. Investors and other

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:47.587
stakeholders are located. From

01:48:47.654 --> 01:48:48.121
the parts department do we

01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:50.390
certainly applaud. Your

01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:53.894
leadership and we stand by at

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:56.830
the ready to our top assistant

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:57.464
on any policy duration related

01:48:57.530 --> 01:49:01.668
virtual. Currency and certainly

01:49:01.735 --> 01:49:08.208
have questions here today.

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:10.143
Commissioner Alvarez. Number

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:10.610
here for rally for me

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:16.349
commissioner commission. Their

01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:16.983
job is to the pressure logging

01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:19.252
Russian about a school of law I

01:49:19.319 --> 01:49:23.156
was in. Both the drafting of

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:24.824
the year curricula sure Kersee

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:27.494
businesses up and the

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:30.964
supplemental act are we what we

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:32.632
will not cover back. That which

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:37.337
are two distinct axle. Press

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:37.904
I'll talk a little bit more

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:41.474
about both. In a minute I've

01:49:41.541 --> 01:49:43.343
I've been asked to speak just a

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:45.712
little you will see. Us for the

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:49.449
river for lunch that's what you

01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:51.284
all want I. Three lost about

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:54.521
the Aussie in the process this

01:49:54.587 --> 01:49:57.390
all try. And make it quick. I

01:49:57.457 --> 01:49:59.893
also got to the to say it's

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:00.393
fairly obvious from. The

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:05.131
present. At signally more of

01:50:05.198 --> 01:50:05.732
the speakers not including me

01:50:05.799 --> 01:50:06.299
are are fairly professional

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:11.705
testify. I tend to have notes

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:12.339
and the from the glass when I

01:50:12.405 --> 01:50:13.506
go testifying I never take more

01:50:13.573 --> 01:50:19.679
than two minutes to prepare

01:50:19.746 --> 01:50:20.313
that's because of about twenty

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:20.880
minutes talk. I'm expecting

01:50:20.947 --> 01:50:22.248
questions. That kind of like

01:50:22.315 --> 01:50:32.892
Apollo. In in. Everyone at arms

01:50:32.959 --> 01:50:33.426
from walking mission is a

01:50:33.493 --> 01:50:34.761
nonprofit organization made up

every states the delegations

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:53.613
are made up of mixtures of

of any particular states. Adult

We significant state Sir are

01:51:24.477 --> 01:51:29.549
surprisingly small others I

01:51:29.616 --> 01:51:32.886
heard a- little bit of a swipe

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:34.721
at it Montana I won't have a.

01:51:34.788 --> 01:51:35.321

state the uniform là

01:51:37.223 --> 01:51:37.757

committees and subcommittees

01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:45.632
but when it comes to. Taking

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:49.402
the product of drafting

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:50.036
committee is to the floor of

01:51:50.103 --> 01:51:53.740

delegation eighteen twenty

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:01.114
eight for that matter AB

01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:06.219
usually how many of them show

01:52:06.286 --> 01:52:11.491
up comes down to. Members. The

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:14.561
commission. Been in business

01:52:14.627 --> 01:52:16.329
for twenty years. Of the very

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:19.065
significant uniform acts that

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:23.636
have been very widely adopted

01:52:23.703 --> 01:52:27.307
by the Ste it's the bell Weber

01:52:27.373 --> 01:52:29.476
are the bell cow we will. Is

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:33.580
what I. Time to. Code AB which

01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:34.180
has been adopted in all fifty

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:35.582
states as well as district of

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:37.450
Columbia have with the

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:38.084
exception that Louisiana it's

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:39.452
refused to adopt the sales and

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:40.086
leases provisions because they

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:41.354
like their Napoleonic code

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:45.325
better. But there are other

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:45.825
acts that you'll see is

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:47.527
produced that have not really

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.729
met with much success probably

01:52:49.796 --> 01:52:51.498
the most notorious at least in

01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:53.333
my again fields is called

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:53.766
uniforms information

01:52:53.833 --> 01:52:55.668
transactions act. Which was an

01:52:55.735 --> 01:52:57.704
attempt to come up with the

01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:59.439
uniformed law dealing with

01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:01.441
software transactions among

01:53:01.508 --> 01:53:03.743
other things I started off as

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:05.345
being part of the used as part

01:53:05.411 --> 01:53:05.945
of a new a new article for the

01:53:06.012 --> 01:53:09.415
UCC bombed out. The American

01:53:09.482 --> 01:53:10.049
law institute bailed out of the

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:11.751
project and left it in the U.

01:53:11.818 --> 01:53:15.388
Aussies lab. And once the

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.323
you'll see was finished with

01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:21.394
that exactly two states now in.

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:21.995
Eighteen years of adopted. And

01:53:22.061 --> 01:53:23.763
what I like to tell my students

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:25.265
when we talk about it is that.

01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:25.899
What's unique about the act is

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:27.834
the three states of actually

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:29.435
enacted with reporter comma

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:30.036
refer to as you see the bomb

01:53:30.103 --> 01:53:33.406
shelter laws. That will prevent

01:53:33.473 --> 01:53:35.308
you see to from applying to

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:37.677
their residents. Even if the

01:53:37.744 --> 01:53:39.512
governing law for transaction

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:45.218
would point to the law of

01:53:45.285 --> 01:53:51.524
either Maryland. The eye of the

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:54.327
beholder. And as I said spend

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:54.961
most my time teaching you from

01:53:55.028 --> 01:53:57.263
commercial code in one of the

01:53:57.330 --> 01:54:00.600
things that I tell my students

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:01.234
is that. The uniform commercial

01:54:01.301 --> 01:54:03.469
code. A misnomer it is not

01:54:03.536 --> 01:54:07.840
uniform. Mostly uniform. And

01:54:07.907 --> 01:54:12.245
parts of it are the what

01:54:12.312 --> 01:54:12.845
anybody. Is in the code base

01:54:12.912 --> 01:54:15.615
some would consider to be a-

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:17.984
well it's been codified. Is on

01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:21.254
what. Bob sizzled about the you

01:54:21.321 --> 01:54:26.159
will see at the center

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:26.759
volunteers we're not we're not

01:54:26.826 --> 01:54:27.594
stated in any way although for

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:35.101
our states will remembers.

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:35.635
Acosta ending the annual

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:36.269
meeting which is basically our

01:54:36.336 --> 01:54:38.271
hunger if you were. We're a for

01:54:38.338 --> 01:54:45.845
a week we- is the completion.

01:54:45.912 --> 01:54:48.581
Question suggestions en en dag

01:54:48.648 --> 01:54:49.115
occasionally get arguments

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:53.820
about the direction of the

01:54:53.886 --> 01:54:56.256
drafting committees. Are taking

01:54:56.322 --> 01:54:56.889
that or whether there should be

01:54:56.956 --> 01:55:00.126
project. Go forward and only

01:55:00.193 --> 01:55:00.727
for the for the acts that are

01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:03.129
ready to be. Put before the

01:55:03.196 --> 01:55:06.032
body for a vote there the body.

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:07.267
The last day and we both the

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:11.404
mother nay and then both the-

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:14.574
should say. Out to the state's

01:55:14.641 --> 01:55:15.508
attorney they've been approved

01:55:15.575 --> 01:55:17.777
ago the state actually first

01:55:17.844 --> 01:55:18.378
they go to the American bars.

01:55:18.444 --> 01:55:22.949
Are sincere. As they- but on

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:23.516
not. After we finished with

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:27.720
them they also have advisors.

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:28.321
On all of our study commission

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:32.292
drafting committees. And then.

01:55:32.358 --> 01:55:32.892
This to me is fine with what

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:34.627
we've done which could be

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:39.165
because there's always at least

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:39.766
one AB adviser on the project

01:55:39.832 --> 01:55:42.835
at all. The axe become

01:55:42.902 --> 01:55:46.906
available the state's. Or at

01:55:46.973 --> 01:55:50.176
worst. And raft into actual

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:59.018
bill. In the FAQ section not be

01:55:59.085 --> 01:56:02.322
word for word what comes. Out

01:56:02.388 --> 01:56:02.922
of the Aussie I am. I from my

01:56:02.989 --> 01:56:04.223
perspective. Specially state

01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:11.464
law. That seven in in one my

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:18.371
correction it has acted. In

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:20.039
Rhode Island the yeah. A and

01:56:20.106 --> 01:56:24.510
the this seven a law. We're

01:56:24.577 --> 01:56:29.916
twist to it not sure that. Of a

01:56:29.982 --> 01:56:30.516
sign post but read up on that

01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:35.521
in fact the. N. the bill in

01:56:35.588 --> 01:56:37.657
Nevada earlier this year made

01:56:37.724 --> 01:56:42.261
it up. Quite far but because

01:56:42.328 --> 01:56:42.895
the internet a legislature only

01:56:42.962 --> 01:56:44.797
meeting every other year and

01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:46.566
having very hard deadlines on

01:56:46.632 --> 01:56:47.100
when bills reported out of

01:56:47.166 --> 01:56:48.801
committees. The originating

01:56:48.868 --> 01:56:51.104
chamber that before they can

01:56:51.170 --> 01:56:51.771
move on to the other chamber in

01:56:51.838 --> 01:56:54.907
to a floor vote. I'm were times

01:56:54.974 --> 01:57:03.516
as many bills it could possibly.

01:57:03.583 --> 01:57:05.885
Gotten through this. It it.

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:08.388
Basically got help. I'm sure

01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:08.988
there's a little bit movement.

01:57:09.055 --> 01:57:14.927
But it's a slowly. We hope that.

01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:17.997
Let's see what all process

01:57:18.064 --> 01:57:18.498
Wiest D. S. would want

01:57:18.564 --> 01:57:20.566
commissioner has more work and

01:57:20.633 --> 01:57:21.134
a member of the executive it

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:21.701
has the notion that there's

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:25.505
something like. In this new

01:57:25.571 --> 01:57:31.544
except en worthy. Some benefit

01:57:31.611 --> 01:57:35.114
nine in having uniform law that

01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:38.017
were at least more uniform law

01:57:38.084 --> 01:57:43.890
all of this having less than.

01:57:43.956 --> 01:57:47.427
The person sure. I'm in cation

01:57:47.493 --> 01:57:49.395
Congress will that take the

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:55.435
horns and solve. Alas at nine a

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.637
issue the Switzerland and the

01:57:57.703 --> 01:57:59.972
U. K. and Singapore don't have

01:58:00.039 --> 01:58:02.108
to deal with this fifty three

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:08.581
jurisdictions with the single

01:58:08.648 --> 01:58:11.417
national jurisdiction. The

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:15.221
proposal's may two greatest

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:17.757
medi at again Dodd is as much

01:58:17.824 --> 01:58:22.628
background. Move on. A for this

01:58:22.695 --> 01:58:23.229
act was created in in it will

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:24.130
for the for the RV CVA was

01:58:24.197 --> 01:58:28.534
created. I in January of twenty

01:58:28.601 --> 01:58:30.236
fourteen. By telephone mostly.

01:58:30.303 --> 01:58:33.339
We're serving up of about

01:58:33.406 --> 01:58:33.906
eighteen months there was a

01:58:33.973 --> 01:58:37.376
large stakeholders. Person

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:37.977

to the executive of the you'll

01:58:46.586 --> 01:58:49.922
get to. Set up a drafting

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:51.457
committee I'm just weird thing

01:58:51.524 --> 01:58:53.926
that rebel. The stakeholders

01:58:53.993 --> 01:58:57.697
meeting in the drafting process

01:58:57.763 --> 01:58:59.465
that followed we have the- a

about two years AB we started

in the fall of twenty eighteen

01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:39.438

exception of the next act I'm

01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:47.413
gonna mention really briefly

spread over five that the seven

01:59:55.821 --> 01:59:59.492
days of the meeting ultimately

01:59:59.559 --> 02:00:01.761
the vote was overwhelmingly in

02:00:01.827 --> 02:00:05.498
favor of approving the act as

02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:07.700
amended in response to the

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:09.635
extensive discussion on the

02:00:09.702 --> 02:00:13.439
floor. I think it was something

02:00:13.506 --> 02:00:15.474
on the order of ninety eight hi

02:00:15.541 --> 02:00:19.679
objection nursery. Getting too

02:00:19.745 --> 02:00:20.246
many there are a forty eight

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:23.683
highest. Extensions into non

02:00:23.749 --> 02:00:25.685
voting's it's been awhile since

02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:26.319
Porter Rico send anybody to the

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:27.753
meeting. One thing that we that

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:29.555
we encountered as we were

02:00:29.622 --> 02:00:30.122
approaching the end of the

02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:31.724
drafting process for the U. R.

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:33.492
V. should be a was. Was this

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:37.630
question of. How this might

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:39.298
integrate with existing

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:41.534
commercial law. We've been so

02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:43.703
focused on on the thrust of the

02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.571
your first BCV a witch's.

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:49.375
Prudential regulation. If you

02:00:49.442 --> 02:00:51.611
know the it's perfectly fine if

02:00:51.677 --> 02:00:53.646
people want to. Send directly

02:00:53.713 --> 02:00:57.416
from one to the other at that

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:59.518
point ether are or- like

02:00:59.585 --> 02:01:01.354
pointer does point or whatever

02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:01.954
it is that they they're- you

02:01:02.021 --> 02:01:03.689
know that they happen to have.

02:01:03.756 --> 02:01:05.625
Our act has nothing Greg

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:07.460
gnostic about that it is not a

02:01:07.526 --> 02:01:09.428
regulation of virtual currency

02:01:09.495 --> 02:01:11.530
act. Is a regulation of virtual

02:01:11.597 --> 02:01:13.399
currency business activity act

02:01:13.466 --> 02:01:15.835
we only. That are the act only

02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:17.837
cares when intermediaries. Get

02:01:17.903 --> 02:01:21.574
involved and really more so

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:23.309
when medi intermediaries get

02:01:23.376 --> 02:01:25.378
involved right so opinion sure

02:01:25.444 --> 02:01:29.515
you probably need. A that means

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:35.354
that something like point based.

02:01:35.421 --> 02:01:37.456
Is dead to me and an exchange

02:01:37.523 --> 02:01:39.792
to. Carry out the transaction

02:01:39.859 --> 02:01:41.661
but if I give my credentials to

02:01:41.727 --> 02:01:43.629
someone else to then interact

02:01:43.696 --> 02:01:45.531
with point days and- the result

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:46.032
of that transaction the

02:01:46.098 --> 02:01:47.700
credentials fall into the hands

02:01:47.767 --> 02:01:49.368
you are are directed to the

02:01:49.435 --> 02:01:51.404
hands of the of a fourth party.

02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:53.406
Who then ultimately is acting

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:54.073
on behalf of the all of it at

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:57.343
the end user there are

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:59.512
increasing opportunities for

02:01:59.578 --> 02:02:01.414
things to go wrong and we're

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.549
very concerned about. The

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:05.384
transferred the exchange and

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:07.486
the studio functions the that

02:02:07.553 --> 02:02:09.488
those intermediaries performing

02:02:09.555 --> 02:02:11.357
that's really almost entirely

02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:13.359
what the virtual currency

02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:15.528
business regulation. Business

02:02:15.594 --> 02:02:19.365
to an activity actors about.

02:02:19.432 --> 02:02:21.434
Plus consumer protection. The

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.769
most so late in the process we

02:02:23.836 --> 02:02:25.337
began to worry that because

02:02:25.404 --> 02:02:27.506
contrary to what you might of

02:02:27.573 --> 02:02:29.608
red and on online fortune piece

02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:35.381
earlier this year there is no

02:02:35.448 --> 02:02:35.948
opportunity for fractional

02:02:36.015 --> 02:02:37.650
reserve banking under the

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:42.088
either the yours CD the CPA or

02:02:42.154 --> 02:02:46.726
the supplemental act. Virtual

02:02:46.792 --> 02:02:48.928
currency businesses have to

02:02:48.994 --> 02:02:53.132
maintain not only 1100% but one

02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:55.601
two one. Research if somebody

02:02:55.668 --> 02:03:00.439
gives them. Whatever that they

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:02.074
have to keep exactly that not a

02:03:02.141 --> 02:03:06.545
dollar equivalent on the day

02:03:06.612 --> 02:03:07.079
that the that the virtual

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:09.882
currency comes down. Sing what

02:03:09.949 --> 02:03:11.083
is the level and on the day the

02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:16.689
virtual goes out. But hold one

02:03:16.756 --> 02:03:18.924
one one hundred reserve. I

02:03:18.991 --> 02:03:21.360
think if you know the old days

02:03:21.427 --> 02:03:25.598
when current based on. I am the

02:03:25.664 --> 02:03:28.167
head to keep it cold or think

02:03:28.234 --> 02:03:28.734
of Las Vegas if you've ever

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:32.838
seen oceans. In cash in it's a

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:33.439
fault. Another money to cover

02:03:33.506 --> 02:03:35.841
every single chip in play for

02:03:35.908 --> 02:03:38.410
the casino. Millions and

02:03:38.477 --> 02:03:39.044
millions of dollars every night

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:47.286
in cash. Way. We would make

02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:51.657
chips that would bills. That

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:54.226
creates a real problem. This is

02:03:54.293 --> 02:03:56.796
the to get access to credit.

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:57.396
And the need to earn money to

02:03:57.463 --> 02:04:02.935
expand have. Because the

02:04:03.002 --> 02:04:04.336
lenders that they might go to

02:04:04.403 --> 02:04:05.337
it he sees that the I guess to

02:04:05.404 --> 02:04:09.275
are sufficiently familiar with.

02:04:09.341 --> 02:04:11.510
This is and how it works. The

02:04:11.577 --> 02:04:12.178
general consumer you user right

02:04:12.244 --> 02:04:13.846
that the consumer but other

02:04:13.913 --> 02:04:16.582
user protection provisions of

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:21.854
section five a to the act. The

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:23.589
supplemental act was created to

02:04:23.656 --> 02:04:24.056
replace those general

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:29.762
provisions perfectly fine. And

02:04:29.829 --> 02:04:30.362
if you choose to just an act

02:04:30.429 --> 02:04:32.965
the RBC via the I will be. Fine

02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:35.601
and I think most of will be

02:04:35.668 --> 02:04:36.202
fine but- the more sought the

02:04:36.268 --> 02:04:40.206
supplement. I am not please.

02:04:40.272 --> 02:04:44.944
The broadly brushed can use

02:04:45.010 --> 02:04:45.578
your actions and section of two

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:49.882
of the of the fact that with

02:04:49.949 --> 02:04:52.618
the extra protections that are

02:04:52.685 --> 02:04:53.252
available under article eighty

02:04:53.319 --> 02:04:55.821
sixty. I've created this river

02:04:55.888 --> 02:04:58.591
known environment. I've known.

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:05.965
Predator fire it will create

02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:06.498
opportunities for virtual

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:07.132
currency businesses to attract

02:05:07.199 --> 02:05:09.835
capital and expand making their

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:15.674
services more you. All hot this

02:05:15.741 --> 02:05:17.743
is I know I've probably gone

02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:19.745
over my time I having got close

02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:21.347
to where I was going but- how

02:05:21.413 --> 02:05:21.947
we for questions thank you and

02:05:22.014 --> 02:05:23.549
I just said that it wanted to

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:25.618
ask thank you for that overview

02:05:25.684 --> 02:05:26.252
that both of you have kind of

02:05:26.318 --> 02:05:29.488
given the history but also just

02:05:29.555 --> 02:05:30.089
the role of the D. B. O. as

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:33.459
well if you could respond to

02:05:33.525 --> 02:05:34.059
any of the things that you

02:05:34.126 --> 02:05:35.661
heard that from the previous

02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:37.529
panels that caught your

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:38.230
attention if you could. Just be

02:05:38.297 --> 02:05:41.533
very specific on what caught

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.067
your attention in in your

02:05:42.134 --> 02:05:45.604
reaction to that. Jump start. I

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:53.913
have I have lots of stars. So

02:05:53.979 --> 02:05:54.546
one thing that that element in

02:05:54.613 --> 02:05:58.817
a said that that a caught. Me.

02:05:58.884 --> 02:05:59.351
Off guard was was she made

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:01.587
reference to. Missing via the

02:06:01.654 --> 02:06:04.023
supplemental actors no license

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:05.925
in the supplemental actively.

02:06:05.991 --> 02:06:06.492
You're to replace the user

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:08.761
protection provisions in

02:06:08.827 --> 02:06:13.232
section five oh two and create

02:06:13.299 --> 02:06:19.104
a. A more stable credit up

02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:23.008
opportunity. For assistance

02:06:23.075 --> 02:06:23.642
occupying the space. Something

02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:27.646
she said in people's. The did

02:06:27.713 --> 02:06:28.280
resonate thank you mean the- we

02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:30.616
counted fifty three state life.

02:06:30.683 --> 02:06:33.485
For every state has its own

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:35.788
licensing requirements and

02:06:35.854 --> 02:06:36.355
that's why we included as a

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:39.525
possible. Your view TV. And

02:06:39.591 --> 02:06:40.092
there's also something wrong

02:06:40.159 --> 02:06:41.560
actually early something that

02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:42.127
could be seen as being wrong

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:42.761
with requiring somebody already

02:06:42.828 --> 02:06:43.762
has a money transmitter license

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:45.397
in the state of California or a

02:06:45.464 --> 02:06:47.666
bank license back in the state

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:48.267
of California if it's State

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:49.468
Bank were federal bank which

02:06:49.535 --> 02:06:51.403
their federal banker completely

02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:53.339
exempt from the act but

02:06:53.405 --> 02:06:53.973
something wrong with requiring

02:06:54.039 --> 02:06:55.741
them to get yet another license

02:06:55.808 --> 02:06:57.910
and so we also have reciprocity

02:06:57.977 --> 02:07:01.380
across. Types of licensure that

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:05.284
is overseen by the same agency

02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:07.586
or by an agency with which the

02:07:07.653 --> 02:07:09.455
agency that's assigned the

02:07:09.521 --> 02:07:11.290
responsibility of virtual

02:07:11.357 --> 02:07:11.924
currency at business activity

02:07:11.991 --> 02:07:15.294
regulation is communicating

02:07:15.361 --> 02:07:17.463
with so it really you know

02:07:17.529 --> 02:07:19.398
creates a possibility not act I

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:19.865
have to be honest the

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:21.633
conference state banking

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:23.402
supervisors initially with

02:07:23.469 --> 02:07:24.036
working give very closely with

02:07:24.103 --> 02:07:27.606
us on this project. Provide a

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:28.140
lot of input to which you

02:07:28.207 --> 02:07:29.808
responded and to be very happy

02:07:29.875 --> 02:07:31.677
with where we're going and then

02:07:31.744 --> 02:07:35.447
at the you know not even the

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:36.081
eleventh hour because it was a

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:36.582
long after the act been

02:07:36.648 --> 02:07:37.716
promulgated but now with the

02:07:37.783 --> 02:07:39.718
fifteenth or sixteenth our

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:41.787
we're we're out trying to get

02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:43.622
states to enact it they're

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:45.557
balking at reciprocity. That

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:49.361
because they want to be able to

02:07:49.428 --> 02:07:51.530
decide who has licenses to do

02:07:51.597 --> 02:07:55.667
this kind. Of business in their

02:07:55.734 --> 02:07:59.705
state. Me. They still even if

02:07:59.772 --> 02:08:00.205
someone is reciprocally

02:08:00.272 --> 02:08:01.707
licensed across state lines or

02:08:01.774 --> 02:08:02.307
reciprocal licensed within a

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:03.709
state because they have

02:08:03.776 --> 02:08:05.511
another. License that that

02:08:05.577 --> 02:08:07.379
covers similar activities

02:08:07.446 --> 02:08:07.980
they're still subject to all

02:08:08.047 --> 02:08:09.381
the user protection

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:11.450
requirements. They just don't

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.452
have to get another license.

02:08:13.519 --> 02:08:17.289
And it's really aren't that we

02:08:17.356 --> 02:08:17.890
wish were scratching our heads

02:08:17.956 --> 02:08:21.360
collectively. About about why

02:08:21.427 --> 02:08:23.295
didn't see as PS deserve change

02:08:23.362 --> 02:08:25.664
tax on this. The promises of a

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:27.599
great new you know better

02:08:27.666 --> 02:08:29.368
solution to everything. In

02:08:29.435 --> 02:08:31.804
September in what they came out

02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:33.806
with was state should have been

02:08:33.872 --> 02:08:39.511
a money transmitter laws. Which

02:08:39.578 --> 02:08:43.449
is as one of the. Short

02:08:43.515 --> 02:08:44.016
documents that passed along

02:08:44.083 --> 02:08:45.317
from from the you'll see

02:08:45.384 --> 02:08:45.951
there's some compelling reasons

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:47.820
why virtual currency businesses

02:08:47.886 --> 02:08:49.655
are better regulated as virtual

02:08:49.721 --> 02:08:51.690
currency businesses rather than

02:08:51.757 --> 02:08:53.459
as money transmitters because

02:08:53.525 --> 02:08:54.093
they don't do the same things

02:08:54.159 --> 02:08:55.794
they do more things in some

02:08:55.861 --> 02:08:57.663
instances and they do some

02:08:57.729 --> 02:09:03.302
things differently. At. I

02:09:03.368 --> 02:09:03.902
wonder if the commission shall

02:09:03.969 --> 02:09:11.510
Reyes or you can comment. First

02:09:11.577 --> 02:09:13.712
of all I did a one a think

02:09:13.779 --> 02:09:17.716
professor rally for two things

02:09:17.783 --> 02:09:19.751
one for the for the correction

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:25.357
and to for invoking oceans.

02:09:25.424 --> 02:09:27.526
Ocean's eleven at that. That

02:09:27.593 --> 02:09:29.595
that's fantastic. You know what

02:09:29.661 --> 02:09:33.632
it would. I wanted to echo a

02:09:33.699 --> 02:09:37.569
couple of two comments I heard

02:09:37.636 --> 02:09:39.404
and some the prior panel

02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:41.707
discussions the first season

02:09:41.773 --> 02:09:45.677
martingales call for. Broad

02:09:45.744 --> 02:09:47.479
stakeholder involvement

02:09:47.546 --> 02:09:49.381
throughout this conversation hi

02:09:49.448 --> 02:09:53.418
I completely agree that that

02:09:53.485 --> 02:09:55.387
kind of broad based

02:09:55.454 --> 02:09:59.525
conversation is really critical

02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:01.460
for those of us in California.

02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:03.629
To land to achieve the correct

02:10:03.695 --> 02:10:10.936
result here mean to be Frank.

02:10:11.003 --> 02:10:15.340
There's nothing that. I that I

02:10:15.407 --> 02:10:15.941
think I heard in any the prior

02:10:16.008 --> 02:10:20.145
conversations there was so.

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:20.779
Broad themes that I heard. The

02:10:20.846 --> 02:10:22.514
desire for a robust concert

02:10:22.581 --> 02:10:24.483
protection within the space

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:25.017
whole whole the department

02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:25.651
wholeheartedly agrees with that

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:38.163
and the desire to. To Claire I

02:10:38.230 --> 02:10:41.133
through harmonization. But have

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:41.700
you completely agree with I

02:10:41.767 --> 02:10:48.974
don't. However. And you know

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.976
the other call that I heard in

02:10:51.043 --> 02:10:53.545
the first half as- Brooks

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:55.547
mentioned here is. I were he I

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:59.785
do worry. Form shopping if.

02:10:59.851 --> 02:11:01.687
California gets it wrong or

02:11:01.753 --> 02:11:08.126
potentially goes down it

02:11:08.193 --> 02:11:12.631
correct path yes New York

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:17.236
articulated a. What you might

02:11:17.302 --> 02:11:21.573
our perspective. Mark from

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:22.107
California's perspective I

02:11:22.174 --> 02:11:22.741
think that's an opportunity to

02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:24.409
look to learn from to learn

02:11:24.476 --> 02:11:24.977
from what they did well and

02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:29.982
what they did what they could

02:11:30.048 --> 02:11:32.584
have improved on but the-

02:11:32.651 --> 02:11:35.721
Facebook libra. Think it's an

02:11:35.787 --> 02:11:41.393
example of. One consequence.

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:41.927
Getting it wrong and space

02:11:41.994 --> 02:11:47.466
which is. Actually abdicate our

02:11:47.532 --> 02:11:52.137
legal and regulatory authority

02:11:52.204 --> 02:11:55.307
to other jurisdictions either

02:11:55.374 --> 02:12:00.345
domestically or or broad. I

02:12:00.412 --> 02:12:03.515
worry about the outcomes a-

02:12:03.582 --> 02:12:07.653
from that. I think in the

02:12:07.719 --> 02:12:10.222
interest times get thank both

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:14.092
of you for participating in

02:12:14.159 --> 02:12:14.693
this panel I really appreciate

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:17.663
the input and this gets into

02:12:17.729 --> 02:12:20.565
newcomer Salinas we continue to

02:12:20.632 --> 02:12:21.433
work on my bill AB. Fourteen a

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:25.003
not for too. Often stakeholder

02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:25.570
meetings is that process so

02:12:25.637 --> 02:12:29.941
much. I am without a do you

02:12:30.008 --> 02:12:30.575
also want to thank every single

02:12:30.642 --> 02:12:33.412
one our panelists I think we've

02:12:33.478 --> 02:12:36.615
very robust com question and it

02:12:36.682 --> 02:12:37.182
is clear that. Are different

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:44.289
can. The move forward I wanted

02:12:44.356 --> 02:12:49.961
at our- until also think are.

02:12:50.028 --> 02:12:50.562
Because it is his bill of cap

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:52.464
prompted this call our station

02:12:52.531 --> 02:12:55.534
up eight officially close I do

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:56.168
you want to see if there is any

02:12:56.234 --> 02:13:01.073
public comment. We if there's

02:13:01.139 --> 02:13:03.709
public we ask that you come to

02:13:03.775 --> 02:13:08.613
the microphone and that you.

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:11.950
Comment public comment so feel

02:13:12.017 --> 02:13:12.517
free great thanks for having

02:13:12.584 --> 02:13:13.085
this my name's mark Levin.

02:13:13.151 --> 02:13:18.357
Executive director. Wearing

02:13:18.423 --> 02:13:18.924
advocacy group I bet on. We

02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:22.961
launched exchange as the

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:24.663
company to others the pivoted

02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:25.163
are still around so I

02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:28.834
understand the regulatory

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.702
environment be doing it we even

02:13:30.769 --> 02:13:31.937
played for your bill lays on

02:13:32.003 --> 02:13:35.307
this bill right now is.

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:38.043
Theoretically your exchanges to

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:40.312
me that's not really clear in

02:13:40.379 --> 02:13:44.049
it and right now the D. B. O.

02:13:44.116 --> 02:13:44.683
is not giving money to mission

02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:50.055
licenses for exchanges so if

02:13:50.122 --> 02:13:50.622
this bill was and- I think.

02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:57.429
It's C. in New York state N.

02:13:57.496 --> 02:13:58.063
Xing ten which is blocking user

02:13:58.130 --> 02:14:00.165
in those. I would really kill

02:14:00.232 --> 02:14:02.367
innovate. How come in the U. S.

02:14:02.434 --> 02:14:05.737
in general we've already seen a

02:14:05.804 --> 02:14:07.072
lot of companies moving out of

02:14:07.139 --> 02:14:11.710
the U. S. and blocking American

02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:13.779
customers Susan this is. About

02:14:13.845 --> 02:14:15.680
more exchanges we talked a

02:14:15.747 --> 02:14:17.682
little bit of the other kind

02:14:17.749 --> 02:14:23.955
of. Industries like it's I see.

02:14:24.022 --> 02:14:29.895
Is so I think like to. Off of

02:14:29.961 --> 02:14:33.732
the exchanges and that just

02:14:33.799 --> 02:14:34.800
deal with the. The federal

02:14:34.866 --> 02:14:37.903
rules would be great but I

02:14:37.969 --> 02:14:41.573
don't think the a you'll see

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:45.877
it'll is really great. So

02:14:45.944 --> 02:14:46.445
companies. If they operate

02:14:46.511 --> 02:14:50.749
without a late it's up to fifty

02:14:50.816 --> 02:14:55.821
thousand dollars a day fine

02:14:55.887 --> 02:14:56.455
also it says in there that they

02:14:56.521 --> 02:15:01.092
have to pay to be regulated.

02:15:01.159 --> 02:15:02.694
Which is ext league cost

02:15:02.761 --> 02:15:05.297
prohibitive to vote he's not

02:15:05.363 --> 02:15:09.100
the queen base but- but- I

02:15:09.167 --> 02:15:11.636
would have to hand over a used.

02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:12.270
Transaction from which can be

02:15:12.337 --> 02:15:16.441
sure there's an foreign

02:15:16.508 --> 02:15:17.108
governments so I've I'm really

02:15:17.175 --> 02:15:18.977
excited that you guys are

02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:21.980
willing to listen and learn

02:15:22.047 --> 02:15:22.614
more about the industry and the

02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:23.215
idea is an education problem I

02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:26.418
also the- nine so it's like

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:32.157
really break. But thank you for

02:15:32.224 --> 02:15:33.058
a happiness great. In

02:15:33.124 --> 02:15:34.459
additional public comment we

02:15:34.526 --> 02:15:37.596

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:56.948
of an. Focus has been on Buck

02:15:57.015 --> 02:15:57.516
solution specifically in the

02:15:57.582 --> 02:15:59.618
financial space but also in

02:15:59.684 --> 02:16:01.987
regulatory space might entities.

02:16:02.053 --> 02:16:02.621
So this morning I tried to open

02:16:02.687 --> 02:16:09.327
up a website. That whole at a

02:16:09.394 --> 02:16:09.895

have a license to publish

02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:13.164
things. I pulled my email and I

02:16:13.231 --> 02:16:15.166
tried to send it to a friend

02:16:15.233 --> 02:16:17.402

California. For license for

02:16:21.806 --> 02:16:26.378
because of the. Open up Skype

02:16:26.444 --> 02:16:27.012

not. Was still sleeping on that

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:45.497
would be observed. This will be

02:16:45.564 --> 02:16:47.365
as absurd as requiring a softer

02:16:47.432 --> 02:16:50.302
provide up to ride by a license

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:50.869

02:16:58.743 --> 02:17:02.814
of lack. Knowledge in guns in

the space noticed me depend on

02:17:06.384 --> 02:17:09.054
us this morning and you to

02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:11.790
budget your hands on how to

02:17:11.856 --> 02:17:16.328
explain the difference between

02:17:16.394 --> 02:17:16.995
currencies among the separately.

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:19.397
In nineteen seventy one. It

02:17:19.464 --> 02:17:22.567
being a unit of account and the

02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:25.537
default of exchange has and he

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:29.841
bites. 90% all values being

02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:32.877
transferred sending bites.

02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:39.284
Bloom down rate and then put a

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:43.254
bit con a dollar sign. All

02:17:43.321 --> 02:17:43.788
Pokemon in front of it it

02:17:43.855 --> 02:17:45.991
doesn't matter. So the larger

02:17:46.057 --> 02:17:46.625
point here. The only thing that

02:17:46.691 --> 02:17:53.231
should be. They like it.

02:17:53.298 --> 02:17:57.402
Currency thing up not should

02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.936
not be regulated all those

02:17:58.003 --> 02:17:59.504
create a are putting eighty

02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:03.475

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:28.266
the unbanked who put cash in

02:18:28.333 --> 02:18:30.368
our ATMs to purchase a corner

02:18:30.435 --> 02:18:35.040
of the crypto currencies and

02:18:35.106 --> 02:18:35.640
for many people without bank

02:18:35.707 --> 02:18:40.912
accounts is the only way they

02:18:40.979 --> 02:18:43.048
can. Get into the point

02:18:43.114 --> 02:18:45.917
blockchain space at all ATMs

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:50.789
are naman shops which we paid

02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:57.896
to. Our with. Turned about in a

02:18:57.962 --> 02:18:58.496
eighty nine is not the elation

02:18:58.563 --> 02:18:59.597
overall because we think.

02:18:59.664 --> 02:19:02.867
Necessary to give our

02:19:02.934 --> 02:19:04.069
confidence the consumers. It

02:19:04.135 --> 02:19:06.805
provide. You to the business so

02:19:06.871 --> 02:19:10.141
in support of regulate. What

02:19:10.208 --> 02:19:10.709
worried about is clarity of

02:19:10.775 --> 02:19:15.814
weather. Eastwood or a light

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:20.552
under the spell we have a legal

02:19:20.618 --> 02:19:23.788
we're able legally to operate

02:19:23.855 --> 02:19:24.389
in state set new. And if this

02:19:24.456 --> 02:19:27.559
is a list. In past have

02:19:27.625 --> 02:19:31.029
operating in California well.

02:19:31.096 --> 02:19:34.365
As Mister Brooks pointed out

02:19:34.432 --> 02:19:34.999
anyone a coin space for a while

02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:35.567
which since twenty fifteen

02:19:35.633 --> 02:19:40.405
knows the strong of. Patients

02:19:40.472 --> 02:19:43.575
from fence. Our compliance

02:19:43.641 --> 02:19:44.175
departments are big department

02:19:44.242 --> 02:19:47.846
and six. Well support the G. O.

02:19:47.912 --> 02:19:49.347
ideas behind the bill what

02:19:49.414 --> 02:19:49.814
we're asking for is a

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:51.950
distinction between custodians

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:52.517
those whose whole customer

02:19:52.584 --> 02:19:54.652
funds on behalf of a consumer

02:19:54.719 --> 02:19:58.289
and those who are just doing

02:19:58.356 --> 02:19:58.923
wallet và wallet transactions

02:19:58.990 --> 02:20:02.160
we make sure that this bank

02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:06.197
that this bill does. The on

02:20:06.264 --> 02:20:08.266
bank people who don't have bank.

02:20:08.333 --> 02:20:11.669
Taking no company point is the

02:20:11.736 --> 02:20:13.571
only place we can by crypto. So

02:20:13.638 --> 02:20:15.473
you know worse than burning

02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:16.040
small business to make sure

02:20:16.107 --> 02:20:18.476
there's no. The fact. And we'd

02:20:18.543 --> 02:20:21.713
like to ask for a wallet và

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:25.483
wallet exemption this bill to

02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.984
separate those who hold

02:20:26.050 --> 02:20:27.385
people's funds from those. Sent

02:20:27.452 --> 02:20:31.489
to. And I like to as for a

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:33.525
holding this panel and I

02:20:33.591 --> 02:20:34.025
appreciate your has been

02:20:34.092 --> 02:20:37.729
opened. Thank you. My name is

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:39.764
grant to lessen I'm a faculty

02:20:39.831 --> 02:20:41.399
here a three on though and I

02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:44.369
guess on behalf of myself and

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:44.936
some of my students I have

02:20:45.003 --> 02:20:50.074
couple of comments. And more

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:50.642
like questions. To Mr I'll

02:20:50.708 --> 02:20:54.412
drop. The appeal towards

02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:54.913
immigrants sending route

02:20:54.979 --> 02:20:58.116
remittances to serve. A very

02:20:58.183 --> 02:21:04.355
good one considering. That I

02:21:04.422 --> 02:21:08.960
mean there's like six. Dollars.

02:21:09.027 --> 02:21:09.594
And a lot of it's going to the

02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:10.195
student body that we have here

02:21:10.261 --> 02:21:16.267
on campus. It depended on two

02:21:16.334 --> 02:21:16.835
things right people need to

02:21:16.901 --> 02:21:19.137
have access to technology and

02:21:19.204 --> 02:21:21.539
does well see vetting this is

02:21:21.606 --> 02:21:22.140
the remittances. So I need to

02:21:22.207 --> 02:21:26.177
have act. It is a- controlling

02:21:26.244 --> 02:21:29.380
interest in being able to

02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:30.014
regulated because that's going

02:21:30.081 --> 02:21:34.285
to end up the very very

02:21:34.352 --> 02:21:34.752
profitable and instead

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:39.824
monogrammed. 20% on every time

02:21:39.891 --> 02:21:42.527
you pointed out wait to take

02:21:42.594 --> 02:21:45.396
some of the. Two words correct

02:21:45.463 --> 02:21:47.899
money. Why recipient is a great

02:21:47.966 --> 02:21:52.103
thing but there is a. Blank

02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:55.039
problem to it our only goal of

02:21:55.106 --> 02:21:55.673
federal trying actions needs to

02:21:55.740 --> 02:22:01.212
be regular. Don cherry

02:22:01.279 --> 02:22:05.183
transactions between the state

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:07.385
and foreign state that means

02:22:07.452 --> 02:22:07.952
regulated anything only not

02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:09.721
complete data by. And you can

02:22:09.787 --> 02:22:15.627
follow through. Is it the gold.

02:22:15.693 --> 02:22:18.096
Very easy to try the

02:22:18.162 --> 02:22:20.765
undocumented individuals are

02:22:20.832 --> 02:22:21.332
doing the said since then it

02:22:21.399 --> 02:22:27.272
would be very. Identify them

02:22:27.338 --> 02:22:29.574
five I'm an that could create

02:22:29.641 --> 02:22:31.643
yet then additional. Probably

02:22:31.709 --> 02:22:34.045
needs to be looked upon and

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:34.646
frankly I think everybody is

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:39.550
aware of it if we have a

02:22:39.617 --> 02:22:40.084
singular regulatory body

02:22:40.151 --> 02:22:42.186
copying it it's pretty much

02:22:42.253 --> 02:22:44.455
like I don't know trip every

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:51.429
department gov regulating the

02:22:51.496 --> 02:22:52.063
dollar and we have like a whole

02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:52.697
bunch of problems. We need that

02:22:52.764 --> 02:22:56.167
evidence. The national business

02:22:56.234 --> 02:22:58.136
controlled by were America.

02:22:58.202 --> 02:23:04.542
Wait. Having a single body

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:07.245
controlling it sort of defeat

02:23:07.312 --> 02:23:10.515
the whole principle and the

02:23:10.581 --> 02:23:14.252
purpose be and having the

02:23:14.319 --> 02:23:19.991
currency that is not. One

02:23:20.058 --> 02:23:20.591
safety not which I think it's

02:23:20.658 --> 02:23:24.829
safe there. Thanks make sure.

02:23:24.896 --> 02:23:25.330
Take place and I think a

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:27.098
blockchain there was a not

02:23:27.165 --> 02:23:27.665
public sometimes gonna have

02:23:27.732 --> 02:23:35.506
desi to wrap it up. We know

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:36.174
exactly where legal transaction.

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:37.942
In like fifty. There's still no

02:23:38.009 --> 02:23:41.145
if stop. The house this nation

02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:41.679
going to address any of it

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:49.887
thank. Please state your name

02:23:49.954 --> 02:23:50.521
affiliation and in two minutes

02:23:50.588 --> 02:23:54.225
good afternoon. My name is

02:23:54.292 --> 02:23:54.726
Chris grow trong I'm the

02:23:54.792 --> 02:23:56.894
president and founder

02:23:56.961 --> 02:23:58.062
constructive insulting firm

02:23:58.129 --> 02:23:58.663
that specializes in blockchain

02:23:58.730 --> 02:24:00.298
could. Out of San Diego. He

02:24:00.365 --> 02:24:07.271
also and banking professionals

02:24:07.338 --> 02:24:07.805
for continuing education I

02:24:07.872 --> 02:24:11.376
think the things. I was

02:24:11.442 --> 02:24:18.149
actually one of the small that

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:22.086
professor rally man was a. The

02:24:22.153 --> 02:24:22.553
initial virtual backed

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:24.155
originally and I think some of

02:24:24.222 --> 02:24:25.890
the things that we need to they

02:24:25.957 --> 02:24:28.459
are. Talk they are censorship

02:24:28.526 --> 02:24:30.928
distance thank you know

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:31.529
initially when we talked about

02:24:31.596 --> 02:24:33.931
like encryption and which some

02:24:33.998 --> 02:24:35.833
of the things are use and this.

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:40.905
As a legal. I was created

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:41.539
because of its ability to treat

02:24:41.606 --> 02:24:45.576
for information. That is a.

02:24:45.643 --> 02:24:47.879
First the first amendment right

02:24:47.945 --> 02:24:48.479
to have free speech part of

02:24:48.546 --> 02:24:49.647
that has to do with your

02:24:49.714 --> 02:24:52.984
ability to how you transact I

02:24:53.051 --> 02:24:53.618
think that's something that we

02:24:53.684 --> 02:24:55.720
should consider I also think

02:24:55.787 --> 02:24:57.789
that this model of how the web

02:24:57.855 --> 02:24:59.557
is work work and the data

02:24:59.624 --> 02:25:03.995
centric model that we have. Is

02:25:04.062 --> 02:25:05.763
to switch and seeing this news

02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:09.400
about web three users data this

02:25:09.467 --> 02:25:09.934
is where this. Is going in

02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:14.639
blocking helps enable. So what

02:25:14.705 --> 02:25:15.139
I heard also liminal the

02:25:15.206 --> 02:25:15.807
limiting of fractional reserve.

02:25:15.873 --> 02:25:16.307
That's something that's

02:25:16.374 --> 02:25:18.509
definitely very important and I

02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:21.312
think the collateral is ation.

02:25:21.379 --> 02:25:25.083
Of sets is also very something

02:25:25.149 --> 02:25:31.189
that needs to be looked into

02:25:31.255 --> 02:25:31.789
especially for the custodians

02:25:31.856 --> 02:25:32.390
in the space. But that when we

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:35.526
talk. See see is are a-

02:25:35.593 --> 02:25:39.997
committee there the reason.

02:25:40.064 --> 02:25:40.598
Looking into I think really

02:25:40.665 --> 02:25:41.699
needs to be considered because

02:25:41.766 --> 02:25:42.266
when you look at tripartite

02:25:42.333 --> 02:25:43.768
agreements with creditors and-

02:25:43.835 --> 02:25:50.741
in. In the assets that are

02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:51.375
being issued or being sold to

02:25:51.442 --> 02:25:53.644
the public and the consumer in

02:25:53.711 --> 02:25:57.181
the protections to go on to the

02:25:57.248 --> 02:25:57.782
companies you have. Credit and

02:25:57.849 --> 02:25:59.317
against those ask. Portantino

02:25:59.383 --> 02:25:59.884
two one once a big point or

02:25:59.951 --> 02:26:03.754
virtual. In it you you can't

02:26:03.821 --> 02:26:05.623
necessarily tiling to that and

02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:07.959
I think it can be very Burzum

02:26:08.025 --> 02:26:08.559
burdensome for these companies

02:26:08.626 --> 02:26:09.594
who are looking to do that so

02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:14.732
as a person who came from. The

02:26:14.799 --> 02:26:17.301
tech industry and switched over

02:26:17.368 --> 02:26:21.572
into fifth tax I see that the

02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:25.376
students are I see that client

02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:25.910
back to. Was a compliance

02:26:25.977 --> 02:26:27.512
officer for. That the

02:26:27.578 --> 02:26:27.912
custodianship and

02:26:27.979 --> 02:26:28.513
intermediaries that we're all

02:26:28.579 --> 02:26:31.382
talking about is definitely one

02:26:31.449 --> 02:26:31.983
of the focuses that needs to

02:26:32.049 --> 02:26:35.253
happen for the specs so I

02:26:35.319 --> 02:26:35.820
really appreciate everyone's

02:26:35.887 --> 02:26:37.889
time I think. You know

02:26:37.955 --> 02:26:43.728
regulatory certainty that. Not

02:26:43.794 --> 02:26:48.733
having. Regulation really does

02:26:48.799 --> 02:26:49.600
increase. Angela Burnett

02:26:49.667 --> 02:26:54.605
opening. They're coming to get.

02:26:54.672 --> 02:26:59.310
I will pave the benefits of

02:26:59.377 --> 02:26:59.911
that community need to have a

02:26:59.977 --> 02:27:04.482
voice well I'm really excited

02:27:04.549 --> 02:27:06.751
to be able to continue taking

02:27:06.817 --> 02:27:07.385
apart and being an advocate for

02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:08.019
the space thinking. Great thank

02:27:08.085 --> 02:27:09.687
you. So with any other

02:27:09.754 --> 02:27:10.288
commenting and I want to thank

special thank you to real Honda
