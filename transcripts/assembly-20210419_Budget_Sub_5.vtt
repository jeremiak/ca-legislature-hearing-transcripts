00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:22.786
MAKES IT HARDER FOR RESIDENTS

00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:24.455
TO BREEZE. THESE IMPACTS

00:45:24.521 --> 00:45:25.522
EXACERBATE THE

HEALTH OUTCOMES THE COMMUNITY

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:30.961
ALREADY EXPERIENCES. MANY OF

00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:33.263
THEM ARE APPARENT VIOLATIONS OF

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:33.831
LOCAL OR STATE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:35.799

SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO AMAZON

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:40.771
WAREHOUSE ARE TWO STRIKING

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:42.372
EXAMPLES OF INSTANCES WHERE

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:43.807
DISTRICT ATTORNEY INTERVENTION

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:45.242
COULD PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:46.777
IMPACTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:47.978
WHILE ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:50.347
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. EXAMPLES

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:51.748
LIKE THIS ABOUND THROUGHOUT THE

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:52.983
INLAND IN RURAL REGIONS IN

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.018
WHICH W WORK WE HOPE THAT THE

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:56.386
STATE LEGISLATURE TAKES

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.055
APPROPRIATE ACTION TO ENSURE

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:59.123
THAT THE INTENT OF THE

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.090
ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT

00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:03.193
INTRIGUING ACT IS REALIZED.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:06.730
THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO OUR

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:08.465
PANEL I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:10.734
AND I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO-

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:11.735
COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WANTED TO

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.737
START WITH THE L. A. AND IF WE

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:15.405
COULD GO BACK TO PAGE SIX OF

00:46:15.472 --> 00:46:25.516
YOUR- REPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:31.188
ERA. YES ABSOLUTELY. MEET A

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:33.757
PARTICULAR PART OKAY I IN YOUR

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:35.792
LAST BULLET ON PAGE SIXTY

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:39.963
TALKED ABOUT CTA'S- PROMISED TO

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:43.467
PAY BACK THE FUNDS. IN YOUR

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:45.002
APPROXIMATION HOW LONG WILL IT

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:47.471
TAKE TO PAY BACK THE FUNDS WITH

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:49.039
THE WHAT WHAT WHAT THE LAST

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:53.010
WITH US THERE. IT'S A LITTLE

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:54.344
BIT FOR US A LITTLE BIT

00:46:54.411 --> 00:46:55.412
DIFFICULT FOR US TO TELL

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.014
BECAUSE WITH THE INVESTIGATION

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.049
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT-

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:00.751
INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED

00:47:00.817 --> 00:47:02.519
RELATED TO TOTAL AMOUNTS. THAT

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:04.121
ARE AVAILABLE ARE A LITTLE BIT

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:06.323
HARD TO COME BY- I WOULD SAY

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.193
THAT. THE KEY FOCUS HERE IS

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:10.894
THAT IT IS UNENCUMBERED AND

00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:13.664
UNRESTRICTED AND IT DOES SEEM

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.966
LIKE THAT QUITE A FEW. OF THE

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:17.601
MONEY THAT I RECEIVE BY CDA ARE

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:19.503
ACTUALLY RESTRICTED AND SO

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:20.871
WE'VE SEEN ESTIMATES THAT THIS

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:22.773
COULD BE SOMETHING AROUND. YOU

00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:24.141
KNOW THE WINDS OF A HUNDRED AND

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:25.342
THOUSANDS YOU KNOW HUNDRED

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:25.876
THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD BE

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:28.111
AVAILABLE. PER YEAR AND SO IF

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:29.146
KEEPING IN MIND THAT THE

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:30.380
AUDITOR FOUND THAT THERE WAS

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:31.682
TWO POINT NINE MILLION THAT

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:35.052
MUST BE REPAID THAT'S- QUITE A

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:36.386
FEW YEARS. SO WE'RE TALKING OF

00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:39.523
AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS. TO REPAY

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.891
THAT IF THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:41.858
THAT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:44.261
YEAR. SO LET'S ASSUME FOR A

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:46.029
SECOND THAT. THEY STARTED

00:47:46.096 --> 00:47:47.431
BORROWING FROM RESTRICTIVE

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:50.000
FUNDS BECAUSE- THERE FINANCES

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:52.970
WERE NOT A- ARE NOT ADEQUATE

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:54.271
AND THE WAY THEY WERE SPENDING.

00:47:54.338 --> 00:47:57.641
AND SO. AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:58.742
EVEN OF THAT PLAN THAT THEY'RE

00:47:58.809 --> 00:47:59.676
NEVER GOING TO HAVE ANY MONEY

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:01.111
AT THE END OF THE YEAR TO REPAY

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:02.212
ANYTHING SOMEBODY HAVE A PLAN

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:04.481
THAT'S AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS IS

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:07.017
ALSO GETS AS MIGHT BE NEVER.

00:48:07.084 --> 00:48:07.985
THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.886
LETTERS THAT. IT THAT IT SEEMS

00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:12.522
LIKE THEY CAN PULL. ONE IS- ON

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:13.957
THE EXPENDITURE SIDE MIKE MADAM

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:16.760
CHAIR BROUGHT UP. THE OTHER IS

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:18.161
ONE OF THEIR FUNDS WORTH IS ON

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:19.830
THE MEMBERSHIP DUES. SIDE FOR

00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:22.466
EXAMPLE AND SO- IT IS POSSIBLE

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:23.667
CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THE

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.402
BOARD COULD CHOOSE TO INCREASE.

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.537
DUES FOR EXAMPLE OR A LOOK AT

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:29.339
RAISING REVENUES AND- OTHER

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:32.276
WAYS- AND THOSE FINES FOR THE

00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:33.710
MOST PART IF THEY'RE COMING IN

00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:35.178
FROM MEMBERSHIP DUES. WOULD BE

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:36.913
A- LESS RESTRICTED THAN YOU

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.616
KNOW COMING IN FROM LITIGATION

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:43.553
FOR EXAMPLE- IN. AND THEN I

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.621
THINK OF COURSE YOUR FIRST BILL

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:46.089
ELLIOTT BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THE

00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:48.759
EASY GROUPS. DOT IT WAS JUST OF

00:48:48.825 --> 00:48:50.527
THE SPECIFIC BONTA WE DON'T AND

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:53.063
WE DO NOT KNOW THERE WAS A

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.665
MISAPPROPRIATION OF OTHER FUNDS.

00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:58.001
HER ACCESS SO- FOR EXAMPLE-

00:48:58.068 --> 00:49:00.671
UNDER LIST OF STATE FUNDING-

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:02.172
THE ASSET FORFEITURE FUNDING

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:03.140
THE HIGH TECH FUNDING THOSE ARE

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:04.841
EXAMPLES OF OTHER FUNDING THAT

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:05.776
THEY'RE GETTING AT LEAST FROM

00:49:05.842 --> 00:49:07.377
THE STATE LEVEL. THAT WAS NOT

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:09.680
REVIEWED BY THE AUDIT THERE ARE

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:12.549
ALSO PROGRAMS WITHIN CDA THAT

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:14.951
ARE OPERATED- WE'VE HEARD FOR

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:18.088
EXAMPLE RELATED TO WORKER

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:19.656
RECEIVE STATE FUNDING BUT THEY

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:21.058
CAN BE RECEIVING LITIGATION

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.859
DOLLARS FROM CASES THAT ARE

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:24.161
EDUCATED LOCALLY AND THEY'RE

00:49:24.227 --> 00:49:25.362
GETTING MONEY THAT WAY SO IT

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:27.331
DIDN'T COVER- IT DIDN'T COVER

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:29.066
REVIEW OF ANY. SORRY DIDN'T

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:31.568
COVER AN AUDIT OF HIGH TECH OR

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.270
THE ASSET FORFEITURE FUNDS- BUT

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:34.571
THERE MAY BE OTHER FINDS A

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:36.006
SIMILAR TO WORKER SAFETY WHICH

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:38.275
WAS REVIEWED- WHERE THE MONIES

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:39.910
ARE COMING IN LOCALLY OR FROM

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:45.382
SETTLEMENTS THAT. THAT ARE-

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:45.916
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN REVIEWED

00:49:45.982 --> 00:49:48.785
EITHER- OKAY AND THEN MAIL MY

FOR THINGS THAT THE CDA IS

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:59.596
DOING TO TRY TO REFORM ITS WAY.

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:00.564
BUT THERE FIVE ADDITIONAL

THAT THEY HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:05.635
ARE THEY NOT PLANNING TO

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:07.070
IMPLEMENT YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:10.874
CLUE ABOUT THAT. I DO NOT KNOW-

00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:25.255
WITH THE FENCE HERE IT'S A

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:25.822
LITTLE FRUSTRATING WE DON'T

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:27.791
HAVE. CDA TO BILLS HAVE SOME OF

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:28.759
THESE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY OF

TALK TO THE E. J. GROUPS AND I

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:38.168
THINK EITHER. I WOULD NEXT

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:39.603
SENATE LEADERS TO COUNCIL AT

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:41.772

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:37.167
LARGE MANUFACTURING IN IN SOUTH

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:38.702
LA. AND THE SURROUNDING AREA.

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:41.071

CONDITIONS THAT THEY'RE

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:03.493
INDIVIDUALS WERE IN- COULD NOT

SOME OF THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:18.608
AYE I THINK YOU COULD POSSIBLY

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:21.444
DO IS ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET COBIT

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:22.846

NINE MILLION AND- THAT IS- IS A

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:09.152
COMBINATION OF WHAT IS OWED TO

00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:10.820
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IT COUNTS. AS

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.422
WELL AS TO THE WORKER SAFETY

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:13.857
ACCOUNTS IF YOU LIKE A

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:15.158
PARTICULAR BREAKDOWN I THINK WE

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:16.192
HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:17.227
OFFICE ON IT BECAUSE I JUST

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:18.294
DON'T HAVE THAT READILY AT MY

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:19.929
FINGERTIPS AT THIS MOMENT BUT

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:21.197
WE CAN. CERTAINLY WORK WITH

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:22.031
YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE THAT

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:24.868
INFORMATION AND I WOULD LOVE.

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.603
TO SEE A BREAKOUT M. IN

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:28.538
ADDITION TO IT I MEAN IT'S HARD

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:30.440
TO HAVE A FULL DISCUSSION. WHEN

00:58:30.506 --> 00:58:32.275
YOU DON'T HAVE THE OTHER SIDE

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:34.544
HERE. AND I. DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.546
APPROPRIATE BUT I I'VE ONLY HAD

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:39.549
LIMITED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:45.955
ABOUT THIS WITH CDA. AT THE-

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.023
MMHM I. THERE WERE ABOUT

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:47.991
LEADING. AND THINGS THAT NATURE

00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:49.959
BUT IT. IS THERE MUST'VE BEEN

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:51.160
SOME. BACK TO YOUR DEPARTMENT

00:58:51.227 --> 00:58:55.498
ABOUT WHY. THEY FEEL THAT. THEY

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:57.734
MAY HAVE SPENT THE MONIES IN A

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.602
CERTAIN WAY THEY CAN CAN YOU

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:00.937
COMMENT ON THAT OR ARE WE IN

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:02.805
THE SAME POSITION OF LITIGATION

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:04.607
YOU DON'T WANT TO. SAY ANYTHING

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:07.010
THAT COULD BE USED. FOR OR

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:09.712
AGAINST THEM- GOOD LUCK I.

00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:11.247
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR POSITION

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:16.886
IS REALLY. SENATE ONLY AGAIN

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:18.521
WHAT THE L. A. L. JUST JUST TO

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:19.722
MAKE IT CLEAR FOR THOSE FOR

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:22.091
LISTENING WE DID NOT DO THE

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:24.494
AUDITS- THE AUDIT WAS CONDUCTED

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.396
BY A PRIVATE COMPANY- CALL

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:29.732
COMING IN MORRIS AND SO. I WE

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:30.967
WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:32.068
CONVERSATIONS MAY HAVE TAKEN

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:33.703
PLACE BETWEEN CA AND HAVING A

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.338
MORRIS- WHICH IS KIND OF THE

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:37.807
TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIP- WHEN

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:39.509
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FEEDBACK

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:41.911
TO AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS- WE

00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:45.315
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH CDA AND

00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:46.582
STATE DEPARTMENTS AS WE WERE

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:47.850
PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CANNOT TO

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:49.686
KIND OF HELP INFORM THAT- I

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:50.820
WOULD SAY THAT THE

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:53.890
CONVERSATIONS WERE FOR FALL-

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:55.058
BUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:56.793
INVESTIGATION MAKES THINGS A

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:57.860
LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING IN

00:59:57.927 --> 01:00:01.397
TERMS OF WHAT INFORMATION CAN

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:03.933
OR CANNOT BE SHARED. OKAY THE

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.403
THANK YOU IT IS IT IS A-

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.372
DIFFICULT GETTING GETTING SOME

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.341
FEEDBACK FROM THE OTHER SIDE

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:14.243
AND I HOPE THAT WE DO WE GET

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:16.379
SOMETHING BACK TO THE WEEKEND

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.514
OBVIOUSLY RESOLVE THIS- BECAUSE

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.550
WHAT WHEN I'M LEVY WITHIN MY

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:23.219

BE A- TO DO THEIR JOB- I LIVE

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:28.591
NEAR THE BOTTOM MY DISTRICT IS

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:30.727
WHAT IS. CLASSICALLY CALLED THE

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.228
CORRUPT CRESCENT AND THERE

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:34.197
CITIES IN WHICH WE NEED TO

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.932
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.667
GO AHEAD BECAUSE THERE'S-

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:39.802
THERE'S FINANCIAL MALFEASANCE

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.804
THAT'S GOING ON IN. EPIC

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:46.843
PROPORTIONS- WHERE D. THE

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.978
MONIES THAT ARE. DEBT MAY BE

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.781
STOLEN IS PROBABLY EQUAL TO OR

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:57.387
NEAR WHAT. THEIR BUDGET IS AND-

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:57.854
AND SO WHAT THEY NEED

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.189
PROTECTION. AND THEN THEY NEED

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:02.425
TO HAVE THE DA'S OFFICE-

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.261

TYPE OF. INVESTIGATIONS SO THAT

WE CAN KEEP GOVERNMENT HONEST

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.476
AND SO- I WOULD I WOULD HOPE

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:23.646
THAT. WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN GET

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.381
THAT KIND OF ASSURANCE BECAUSE

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.884
IT IT IS PROBLEMATIC ON A LOT

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.752
OF DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND-

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:32.255
HOPEFULLY WE CAN. WE CAN GET

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:33.790
BEYOND THIS BUT THIS IS PRETTY

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.725
SIGNIFICANT THAT WE NEED TO

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:37.960
INVESTIGATE SO I JUST WANNA

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:38.528
THANK YOU CHAIR FOR BRINGING

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:41.998

YOU AND AGAIN CDA WAS INVITED

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.269
UP THE- DECLINE TO PARTICIPATE

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:49.806
BECAUSE OF- THAT OCCASION

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:52.141
ISSUES POTENTIALLY- AND SO

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.277
WHILE IT IS- INCOMPLETE PICTURE

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.411
THAT WE ARE GETTING A STILL I

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:57.246
STILL THOUGHT THAT IT MERITED A

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.381
DISCUSSION WITH WITH OUR

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:01.250

YOU IN AN AND I THINK IT DOES.

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:04.153
BUT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.522
DISTINGUISH HERE BETWEEN CDA

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:09.792
WAS ORGANIZATION AND- LOCAL

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:10.793
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.962
OFFICES BECAUSE AS FAR AS I

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:15.832
KNOW. WITH THIS. AUDIT THE

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:18.534
pIMPLICATED THIS IS THE

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:20.903
ORGANIZATION CDA. WHICH SITS IN

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.004
AN INTERESTING POSITION IN THIS

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:22.939
IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:25.241
SEEN THIS THIS IS NOT THE FIRST

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:26.676
TIME THAT THIS THAT THINGS LIKE

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:28.711
THIS HAVE HAPPENED WHERE. WE

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:32.048
HAVE. A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:36.185
THAT IS GETTING. PUBLIC MONEY

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.788
BUT HAS CONFLICTING OBLIGATIONS

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:41.057
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND I

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:42.992
SUBMIT THAT THIS IS PRETTY

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.861
INDICATIVE OF SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:48.030
CULTURAL PROBLEMS WITHIN CDA

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:50.733
WHERE THEY BLITHELY TAKE THEIR

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.702
RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE PUBLIC

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:54.904
MONIES COMING IN BORROW FROM

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:57.740
THOSE ACCOUNTS TO BE USED FOR

01:02:57.807 --> 01:03:00.009
OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT THEY

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:01.711
THEMSELVES CHOOSE TO

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.613
PARTICIPATE IN AND WE KNOW THAT

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:04.147
THIS IS A POLITICAL

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.982
ORGANIZATION. THAT ENGAGES

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:07.450
POLITICALLY ACROSS THE STATE

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:10.286
AND ENGAGES IN ADVOCACY FOR

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.989
SPECIFIC POSITIONS SO ONE HAS

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.557
TO ASSUME WITHOUT OTHER

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.826
INFORMATION THAT MONEY IS BEING

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:19.162
BORROWED FOR FROM LEGITIMATE

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.497
ACCOUNTS TO PERFORM SPECIFIC

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.533
SERVICES GIVEN TO THEM PUBLIC

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.434
MONIES GIVEN TO THEM TO THEN

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:28.638
PERFORM MORE OF PRIVATE

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:31.707
ORGANIZATION. ACTIVITIES THE

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:33.609
LOBBYING THE POLITICAL

01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:36.245
ACTIVITIES AND OTHER THINGS

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.713
THIS IS CLASSIC

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.882
MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS THAT

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:40.550
WE'VE SEEN IN ORGANIZATIONS

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:43.119
ORGANIZATIONS. AND IF YOU LOOK

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.054
AT THE RESPONSE THAT THEY HAVE

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.455
DONE SO FAR WITH THE AUDITOR

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:48.691
POINTING OUT THAT CDA HAS TAKEN

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.927
CERTAIN STEPS THAT TO FOLLOWS

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.728
THE SAME PATTERN WHERE IT'S OH

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:53.863
MY GOSH WE FOUND SOMETHING

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:55.665
WRONG HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:57.266
TO DO WHICH IS AS MINIMAL AS

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:58.634
THEY THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:01.170
WITH. IN ORDER TO RECOVER THE

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:02.838
MONEY IS THE PROBLEM FOR US

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:05.508
THOUGH IS THIS IS SIGNIFICANT

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:07.076
PUBLIC DOLLARS THREE MILLION.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:11.247
OF MISAPPROPRIATED FUNDS. AND A

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.882
SEEMINGLY VERY CAVALIER

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:15.017
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THAT

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:17.587
MISAPPROPRIATION SO THAT'S WHY

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.455
IT IN WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THIS

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.723
BEFORE IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.725
THAT IS CLEARLY A CULTURAL.

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.994
PROBLEM THAT SHOULD LEAD TO

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:26.462
SOME SIGNIFICANT SHAKE UP NOT

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.998
JUST. MINOR CHANGING OF

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:31.000
POLICIES AND A COMMITMENT TO

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.802
PAY BACK MONEY THEY HAVE IS THE

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.136
AUTHOR POINT OR IS THAT ELLIE-

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:36.272
POINTS OUT. OTHER WAYS TO RAISE

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:39.075
MONEY. TO REMEDY THIS BUT THE

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:40.042
FACT THAT THEY DON'T SEEM

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:42.178
INTERESTED IN COMING UP WITH A

01:04:42.245 --> 01:04:43.679
SERIOUS WAY OF REMEDYING IT AND

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:45.481
JUST SORT OF PAYING OFF IT AS

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:48.084
THEY CAN. FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.353
THAT SHOWS TO ME A LACK OF

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:51.487
SERIOUSNESS AND YEAH THAT'S NOT

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.822
JUST. LOOKING AT THIS

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.590
ORGANIZATION BUT HAVING SEEN

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:57.526
THE SAME KIND OF ORGANIZATION.

01:04:57.593 --> 01:05:00.029
REACH THESE PROBLEMS IN IN THE

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:01.697
PAST AND SO THEIR PATTERNS OR

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.332
THE SAME AS WE HAVE SEEN SO I

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:04.600
THINK THEY HAVE SOME VERY VERY

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.569
SIGNIFICANT INTERNAL. PROBLEMS

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:08.371
THAT THEY NEED TO OWN UP TO.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.206
AND DEAL WITH. ACCORDING TO THE

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:11.841
AUDIT REPORT THAT THE L. A. WAS

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:13.276
WAS LOOKING AT THEY'VE BEEN

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.710
HAVING SERIOUS FINANCIAL

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.946
PROBLEM SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:20.416
FOUR. AND SHOWS. CHOSE TO DEAL

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:22.551
WITH THAT BY BORROWING. FROM

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:25.154
PUBLIC DOLLARS TO PAY FOR OTHER

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:30.493
ACTIVITIES. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:32.795
WE PROBLEMATIC AS A MISUSE OF

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:34.797
FUNDS MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.365
AND A REAL PROBLEM AGAIN

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:38.701
POINTED TO SOME VERY KIND OF A

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.803
CAVALIER ATTITUDE A INTERNAL

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.105
CULTURAL PROBLEM WITH RESPECT

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:45.841
TO HOW THEY- LOOK AT MONEY HOW

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:47.510
THEY WANT TO MANAGE MONEY AND

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.278
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:50.579
CLEARLY WHAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:51.914
THEM. FOR THE PURPOSES FOR

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.784
WHICH THE MONEY WAS RECEIVED BY

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.386
CDA AT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.855
THEM WERE THOSE PROGRAMS THAT

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:01.791
THEY DIVERTED THOSE FUNDS TO

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:02.892
THAT THEY LOANED THE FUNDS TO

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:05.227
WITHOUT ANY PLAN. FOR PAYING

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:08.130
THEM BACK. AGAIN CLASSIC KIND

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:13.002
OF INTERNAL. EITHER WHILE

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:15.538
CULTURAL PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:17.473
TO ME COULD BE INCOMPETENCE BUT

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.075
I THINK THIS WAS A PLANNED WAY

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.609
BUT BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:21.911
PLAN FOR COMING OUT FROM

01:06:21.977 --> 01:06:23.346
UNDERNEATH THIS THERE'S SOME

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.081
REAL STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THERE

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:26.916
SO WHAT CAN WE DO I THINK WE

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:29.185
CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE AN

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.386
ORGANIZATION LIKE THIS RECEIVED

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:31.787
THE MONEY AND WE CAN CHANGE

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:33.989
THAT BY ENSURING THAT THE MONEY

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:35.858
GOES DIRECTLY TO THE RECIPIENT

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.259
ORGANIZATIONS RATHER THAN

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.127
FEEDING IT THROUGH AN

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:41.063
ORGANIZATION THAT HAS SHOWN.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.732
THAT THEY WILL USE THAT MONEY

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:45.601
FOR PURPOSES WHICH GO COUNTER

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:48.337
TO WHAT THE IT THAT INVESTMENT

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:50.806
IN THAT AGENCY WAS IN AND I CAN

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:53.642
UNDERSTAND WHY THE STATE

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:55.211
DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:57.613
CONTRIBUTED TO CDA WOULD EXPECT

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.949
THEM AND TRUST THEM TO GET THAT

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:01.050
MONEY OUT TO THE LOCAL

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.753
PROSECUTING OFFICES FOR BEST

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:04.487
RESULTS AND DO THAT KIND OF

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.522
TRAINING. BUT THIS IS BEEN A

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:08.057
SYSTEMIC ISSUE WITHIN THAT

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.693
ORGANIZATION SINCE AT LEAST TWO

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.161
THOUSAND AND FOUR THAT THAT

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:13.863
THEY HAVE HAD HAVE NOT REPORTED

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:16.298
IT DID NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:17.800
INTERNAL CONTROLS. SO HOW MUCH

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:18.901
CAN WE TRUST THAT ORGANIZATION

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:20.870
TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT AND TO TAKE

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:22.138
APPROPRIATE STEPS. I DON'T

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.373
KNOW. BUT WE ARE THE ONES DOING

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.574
THE OVERSIGHT WE ARE THE ONES

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:28.077
THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENSURE

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:28.644
THAT MONEY GOES WHERE IT IS

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.780
SUPPOSED TO GO. BYE MORE DIRECT

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:31.947
ALLOCATIONS AS AS WAS

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.516
MENTIONED. BY SOME OF THE

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:34.350
WITNESSES AND I THINK THAT'S

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:36.218
SOMETHING. THAT THIS COMMITTEE

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:38.421
SHOULD BE TAKING A LOOK AT. AND

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:42.291
AS A- POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:44.460
ENSURING THAT WE DO NOT LEAVE

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.896
WITHIN. A SUSPECT ORGANIZATION

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.464
THE TEMPTATION TO CONTINUE TO

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:49.432
TAKE MONEY AND NOT BE

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:50.866
RESPONSIBLE UNTIL THEY COME UP

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:53.135
WITH THE REAL PLAN. TO PAY THIS

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:55.438
MONEY BACK AND PAY IT BACK. NOW

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:57.773
THAT THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.208
FOR THE SPECTER OF THIS MONEY

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:00.876
JUST CAVALIERLY SAY WELL WE'LL

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:02.077
PAY IT BACK OVER THIRTY YEARS

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:05.481
AS WE GET. REVENUES TO BE ABLE

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:07.616
TO PAY BACK. NOT ACCEPTABLE

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:08.451
THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH A

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:10.352
BETTER PLAN FOR THAT. SO THIS

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:13.022
IS TO ME. AN INDICATION OF A

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:15.024
VERY UNHEALTHY ORGANIZATION

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:17.560
WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT. CULTURAL

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:19.762
ISSUES ON HOW IT'S MANAGED AND

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:21.197
A REAL CAVALIER ATTITUDE

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:23.666
TOWARDS ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:25.668
SAY HOW IT SPENDS PUBLIC

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:28.537
DOLLARS. AND THAT'S WHERE I

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.606
THINK WE SHOULD BE TAKING A

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:32.641
LOOK AT. AT OTHER MECHANISMS

01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:34.176
I'M NOT SURE HOW WE DO THAT AT

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.045
THIS POINT. YEAH BUT IT'S

01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:37.179
SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:39.081
THAT WE HAVE STATE. YOU TO TAKE

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:43.619
SOME. ACTIONS ON. AIR AND DO

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:44.887
SOME INVESTIGATION AS TO WHERE

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:46.255
THOSE MONIES ARE COMING FROM

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:47.556
HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT THERE'S

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:49.592
SOME DIRECT ALLOCATION. AS WE

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:51.727
LOOK AT THAT POTENTIAL

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.295
MALFEASANCE IN A PRIVATE

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.831
ORGANIZATION. WHO AND THEY THEY

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:56.966
COULD HAVE BEEN HERE THEY COULD

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.134
PROVIDE INFORMATION WE DON'T

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.768
KNOW THAT THERE IS A CRIMINAL

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:01.904
CASE. THERE'S A JUST AN

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.939
INVESTIGATION THAT'S GOING ON

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.441
SO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT SURE

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:07.710
WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR HOW

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:08.944
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ADDRESSING

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:10.179
THIS ISSUE. BUT THERE IS

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.981
INDICATION THAT THIS IS VERY

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:14.683
VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AB

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:17.152
MISAPPROPRIATION OF. A LOT OF

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:19.688
MONEY. SO I APPRECIATE BUT I'M

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:20.556
SURE THAT YOU BRING THIS

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:22.925
FORWARD AND WE'LL HAVE TO SEE

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:27.563
HOW THIS GOES. THANK YOU MR

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:31.467
STONE- AND- YOU KNOW IT THE

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:32.968
WITH WITH ANY TO PAY THE MONEY

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:36.138
BACK NOW. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:36.872
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.707
ENOUGH BECAUSE IN THE

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:39.975
MISAPPROPRIATION OF THE DOLLARS

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.477
THEY WEREN'T DOING THEIR JOB TO

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:43.212
PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH. ARE

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.915
PROTECT THE EMPLOYEES AND SO I

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:47.483
THINK WE TAKE THAT INTO INTO

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.450
ACCOUNT THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:50.286
IS OWED AND IT DOES BEG THE

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.955
QUESTION IF PUBLIC FUNDS SHOULD

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:53.522
BE GOING TO A PRIVATE

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:56.125
ORGANIZATION. OF THAT HAS A

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.427
QUARTER LIKE YOU SAY THAT. YOU

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:00.029
KNOW TWO THOUSAND FOR AT LEAST

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.230
SEVENTEEN YEARS ABOUT ALSO THAT

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:02.598
ENGAGES IN A LOT OF POLITICAL

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:04.300
ACTIVITY WHICH IS WHAT WHAT

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.534
TROUBLED ME I DO NOT WANT TO

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:07.202
SEE PUBLIC FUNDS BEING USED FOR

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:09.538
POLITICAL- CAMPAIGNS OUT THERE

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:11.040
WE KNOW THAT THEIR AGGRESSIVELY

01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:12.341
ENGAGE IN THOSE CAMPAIGNS. IN

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.243
BIG DOLLARS A MONTH I EVERY

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.745
CYCLE- AND I DO ALSO HAVE THE

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.514
QUESTION OF WHY TOOK SEVENTEEN

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:21.083
YEARS TO. TO UNCOVER THE

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:21.884
SITUATION SINCE IT'S BEEN GOING

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.053
ON FOR AT LEAST ALONG WITH THIS

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:25.721
BUT THIS FUND AND THEY DID ASK

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:26.255
THE QUESTION OF WHAT OTHER

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:29.258
FUNDS- AND SO I DO THINK AS- AS

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:30.626
THE LEGISLATURE WE SHOULD BE

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:33.028
THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:35.097
TO. ENSURE THE FUNDS ARE BEING

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:36.632
USED APPROPRIATELY AND THAT

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:38.167
THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AT THIS

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:43.973
ORGANIZATION- AND I- A- WONDER.

01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:47.242
REALLY WHY UNTIL OF. IN

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.011
ANALYSTS BUT I DO I THINK THE

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:50.312
L. A. L. THEY DID GIVE US A

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.147
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A PICTURE OF

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:54.817

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:56.037
IT OUR TRUANCY AND WE CHANGED

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.338
OUR APPROACH TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:27:57.405 --> 01:27:59.674
ON CAMPUSES. IN ORDER TO GET A

01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:01.542
MORE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. AND

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.044
BUILD THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AT

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:04.946
TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY. AS WELL

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.581
AS PREVENTING THEM INDIVIDUALS

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.583
BECOME BECOMING GOT INVOLVED IN

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:10.151
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:28:10.218 --> 01:28:11.152
AND THEN AT THE DEFLECTION

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:13.187
PERIOD. LOWER LEVEL BEHAVIORS

01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:14.922
RESULTING IN PROGRAM REFERRALS

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:16.257
OR SCHOOLS OR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:17.158
FOR YOUTH ARE HOMELESS AND

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:18.726
FAMILIES. ARE CRITICAL ISSUES

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.128
THAT OUR COMMUNITY SEES EVERY

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:21.596
DAY AS YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:23.564
WANT US TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.066
PEOPLE FOR POVERTY DRIVEN-

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:26.801
FENCES. SO WE REALLY HAD TO

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:27.769
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND SAY

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:29.904
OKAY WHAT ARE WE DOING AND HOW

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.172
IS THAT MAKING OUR COMMUNITY

01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:33.007
BETTER. BY BRINGING SOMEBODY IN

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:34.142
FOR AN OFFENSE THAT REALLY

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:35.376
NEEDS PROGRAMMING SUCH AS

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.545
SUBSTANCE USE MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:39.814
POVERTY. AND SO WE CHANGED OUR

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:41.482
APPROACH TO THAT AND DEFLECTED

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:43.351
AS MANY CASES AS WE COULD. IN

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:44.185
PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:45.720

ENFORCEMENT ARRESTED COLLECTION

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:49.090
PROGRAM. AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:50.058
OTHER COMMUNITY AND FAITH BASED

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:52.093
ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO LIFT

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.861
PEOPLE UP. INSTEAD OF

01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:55.763
INFLICTING MORE HARM FOR WHICH

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:56.664
THEY CAN NEVER GET OUT FROM

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:58.299
UNDER SO WE REALLY SPENT A LOT

01:28:58.366 --> 01:28:59.734
OF TIME ON HOW DO WE DO THIS

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:01.536
PRE ARREST MOTION. AND THEN

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:03.938
DIVERSION. OKAY PREC PRE

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:04.605

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:06.708
JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND AT FIRST WE

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:07.975
THOUGHT LET'S LOOK AT YOU KNOW

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:10.511

PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.686
BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIX

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:20.021
SEVEN EIGHT DECADES. OF THIS

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:21.289
INDIVIDUAL LIVING WITH THIS

FAMILY TO THE COMMUNITY. AND

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.465
THE ECONOMICS OF IT ALL AND SO

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:35.470
WE REALLY LOOKED. AT THAT GROUP

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:36.037
NOW WE'VE EXPANDED TO THIRTY

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:36.604

01:29:40.241 --> 01:29:41.142
THE MONEY THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.144
ON OUR DIVERSION PROGRAM PNCC

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:44.812
IN THE CUP PNCC PLUS WE'RE

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.748
MOVING INTO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:48.850
AN AREA THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:51.185
ARE AFRAID TO GO INTO. BECAUSE

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:51.753
OF THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATER

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:54.388
HARM. BUT IN REALITY THERE'S NO

01:29:54.455 --> 01:29:55.957
ONE AREA WHERE WE CAN DO MORE

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:57.925
GREAT WORK THEN RIGHT THERE.

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.660
BECAUSE WE SEE IN THESE HOMES

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:00.762
WHERE THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH

01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:04.132

ALL IMPACTED. BY A HOME THAT IS

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:15.376
DEALING WITH TRAUMA. SO WE CAN

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:16.644
GET IN THERE AND REALLY DO SOME

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.246
GREAT WORK WE CAN CHANGE THE

01:30:18.312 --> 01:30:19.747

WE'VE DONE IT WE'VE HAD IT FOR

01:44:58.525 --> 01:44:59.726
ABOUT THREE YEARS AND CALL NOW

01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:01.828
AND WE DID AN ANALYSIS BASED ON

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:03.563
THE INDIVIDUALS. THEY STILL

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.165
ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND WE

01:45:05.232 --> 01:45:06.667
HAVE BIG TO ME GAUGE MINT ARE

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:07.701
VICTIMS ARE FULLY INFORMED OF

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:09.469
THE PROGRAM AND ARE PART OF THE

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:11.104
JOURNEY WITH US BECAUSE IT

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:12.939
USED. A CD OVERWHELMING

01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:14.141
RESEARCH TELLS US ARE VICTIMS

01:45:14.207 --> 01:45:15.108
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT NEVER

01:45:15.175 --> 01:45:17.077
HAPPENS AGAIN SO WE'RE DOING

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:20.013
PROPERTIES ASSAULTS GUN CASES

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.149
WERE DOING SERIOUS WERE IN THE

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:24.151
MODERATE RANGE WE'VE MOVED FROM

01:45:24.217 --> 01:45:25.218
LOW LEVEL BECAUSE WE SAW THE

01:45:25.285 --> 01:45:27.154
RISKS OF THE RESULT WE FELT

01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:28.555
CONFIDENT IN IT WITHOUT THE

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:29.623
RESOURCES WERE BEING ADEQUATELY

01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:31.458
USED. AND NOW WE'VE MOVED TO

01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:33.527
MORE MODERATE BEHAVIOR THAT IS

01:45:33.593 --> 01:45:35.328
THAT HIGH RISK GROUP ESPECIALLY

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:36.163
FOR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN UNDER

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:38.465
THE AGE OF THIRTY ANSWER WE DID

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:39.666
AN ANALYSIS BASED ON

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:41.334
INDIVIDUALS THAT IT- CAME INTO

01:45:41.401 --> 01:45:42.502
THE PROGRAM I COMPLETED THE

01:45:42.569 --> 01:45:44.371
PROGRAM VERSUS THOSE WHO DID

01:45:44.438 --> 01:45:45.539
NOT WITH SAME OR SIMILAR

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:47.007
CHARGES IN SAME OR SIMILAR

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:48.175
CRIMINAL HISTORY AN AGING

01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:50.210
FACTORS. AND LIKE I SAID OUR

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:51.745
GROUP IS AS AND HALF THE

01:45:51.812 --> 01:45:54.314
RECIDIVISM RATE- AS THE GROUP

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:55.882
THAT DID NOT ENGAGE IN THIS

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:57.350
PROGRAMMING SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:59.119
IT FROM ITS TOTALITY WE STILL

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:00.721
HAVE THEM TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:01.588
THEY WERE STILL IN COURT AND

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:02.355
THEY STILL HAVE KNOWLEDGE THE

01:46:02.422 --> 01:46:03.523
HARM THAT THEY COMMITTED AND

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:04.958
THE VICTIM HAD A RIGHT TO SPEAK

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:06.126
AND DO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.394
THEM IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO. IF

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:09.162
NOT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BUT

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:10.997
THEY ALSO ALWAYS MOST CASES

01:46:11.064 --> 01:46:12.966
SENT A MESSAGE AS TO WHAT

01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:14.501
HAPPENED TO THEM THEIR JOURNEY

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:15.936
AND WHAT THEIR HOPE WAS FOR

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:17.804
THIS INDIVIDUAL AND SO WHEN WE

01:46:17.871 --> 01:46:20.073
LOOK AT THAT NOW WE KNOW WE CAN

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.108
TAKE IT TO THAT NEXT LEVEL AND

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:22.409
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO A MORE

01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:24.878
FAMILY HARM- WHICH IS THE IS A-

01:46:24.945 --> 01:46:26.079
BIG AREA BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:27.514
LOT OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IN A

01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:29.216
LOT A LOT OF. A PROGRAMMING IN

01:46:29.282 --> 01:46:31.084
THIS AREA THAT HAS SHOWN TO BE

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:33.653
OF VALUE SO WE DO BELIEVE WE

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.821
CAN STAND BEHIND OUR RESULTS

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:36.156
AND WE DO BELIEVE AND I AM A

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:37.457
DISTRICT ATTORNEY I NEVER WAS

01:46:37.524 --> 01:46:38.925
GOING TO GET INTO THIS BUSINESS

01:46:38.992 --> 01:46:40.794
TO BE IN THIS LANGUAGE. AND I'M

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.229
A FIRM BELIEVER OF IT BECAUSE

01:46:42.295 --> 01:46:43.530
IF I CAN LOWER MY RECIDIVISM

01:46:43.597 --> 01:46:49.369
RATE. I CAN'T WILL KEEP VICTIMS

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:50.470
SAFE AS WELL AT THE SAME TIME

01:46:50.537 --> 01:46:51.738
AND SE RI. SO THAT THERE IS A

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:52.506
DATA RE. UP THERE THAT IS. THAT

01:46:52.572 --> 01:46:53.907
IT IS ORK. AND THAT RESPECT

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:55.475
ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY IS

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:59.913
PART OF THE JOURNEY. TOLD ME

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.748
ON. TRY TO ANSWER IT FROM A

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:02.716
DIFFERENT LENS THROUGH A

01:47:02.783 --> 01:47:03.717
DIFFERENT LENS ONE OF THE

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:05.418
PROGRAMS THAT WE- OPERATE THAT

01:47:05.485 --> 01:47:06.820
I DIDN'T DISCUSSES OUR FELONY

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:10.056
PRE TRIAL PROGRAM. AND WE ARE

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:12.125
DIVERTING PEOPLE. DIVERGENCE

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:13.360
NOT THE RIGHT WORD WE ARE

01:47:13.426 --> 01:47:14.895
ACCEPTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLED

01:47:14.961 --> 01:47:16.196
GUILTY OR BEEN PLACED ON

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:18.331
PROBATION LOW MOSTLY FOR

01:47:18.398 --> 01:47:20.000
SERIOUS FELONIES BECAUSE OF THE

01:47:20.066 --> 01:47:22.235
LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL. THAT'S

01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:23.970
KIND OF WHAT'S LEFT OF PEOPLE

CHARGED WITH. SERIOUS CRIMES-

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.675
REDUCE THIS IN COLLABORATION

01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:29.743
WITH THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:31.311

FOR FELONY. IN OUR HOUSE AND

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:45.158
THE RAND CORPORATION. I DID A

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:46.893
STUDY OF THIS PROGRAM AFTER ITS

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.163
FIRST YEAR. BERMAN AND I THINK

01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:52.299
IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:55.602
THAT OUR POPULATION. ON IT IT

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:58.738

01:47:58.805 --> 01:48:00.941
ALONG WITH CO MORBID S. U. D.

01:48:01.007 --> 01:48:02.409
CONDITIONS AND SO THAT THERE

01:48:02.475 --> 01:48:03.410
ARE DIFFICULT POPULATION TO

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:06.146
MANAGE WE HAVE MANAGED TO

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:08.181
MAINTAIN THEM AT AROUND 74%

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:10.116
HOUSING RETENTION RATE WHICH

01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:11.318
MEANS THE COMPANY. EVEN THOUGH

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:12.819
THEY'VE BEEN HOMELESS FOR

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:15.689
DECADES- ANNA RECIDIVISM RATE

01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:16.723
AT THE FOREIGN BY NEW FELONY

PERCENT- BUILDER GREAT PROPERTY

01:48:21.461 --> 01:48:22.362
THAT IS DEFINITELY A PUBLIC

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:25.398
SAFETY AND IN LINE WITH THE

01:48:25.465 --> 01:48:27.000
COUNTY IS CAREFUL WHICH JAIL

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:34.007
LAST LOSS WITH THE. BUT I WILL.

01:48:34.074 --> 01:48:34.841
ECHO WHAT THE NET WE CERTAINLY

01:48:34.908 --> 01:48:36.176
MORE OF THESE TO REDUCE THE

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:39.813
POPULAR IN THE JAIL. AND ONE

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.514
THE DALLAS ALL SALES KNOW WE

01:48:41.581 --> 01:48:42.916
LOOK AT ALL OF OUR WORK

RACIALIST REYES APPLE LINE AND

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:48.488
I WILL TELL YOU THAT- IT'S NOT

01:48:48.555 --> 01:48:50.056
IT'S NOT HEALTHY IN THE LOS

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:51.191
ANGELES COUNTY JAIL TO THAT

01:48:51.258 --> 01:48:53.860
LEFT WHICH IS NOT CHAU. ARE

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:57.230
THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO MY

01:48:57.297 --> 01:49:00.767
COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:04.504
MISS A LOT IF THANK YOU. I'M MY

01:49:04.571 --> 01:49:06.373
QUESTIONS ARE MAINLY AROUND

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:08.108
PROP FORTY SEVEN AND SOME OF

01:49:08.174 --> 01:49:09.643
THE WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:11.478
INCREASES IN CRIMES THAT WE'VE

01:49:11.544 --> 01:49:13.079
SEEN AS A PERTAINS TO PROPERTY

01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:14.881
CRIME LARCENY SINCE THE

01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:17.517
PASSAGE- TO THE DISTRICT

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:20.887
ATTORNEY IN SAN JOAQUIN- AND-

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:24.291
CONTRA COSTA- OR HAVE YOU SEEN

01:49:24.357 --> 01:49:26.660
AN INCREASE IN PROPERTY CRIME

01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:46.413
AND LARCENY. WE. I THINK ONE OF

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:48.982
THE THINGS THAT- WE DO IT WE

01:49:49.049 --> 01:49:50.550
WILL I HATE IT KNOWLEDGE IS

01:49:50.617 --> 01:49:53.253
FALL- SINCE WE'VE BEEN IN

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.789
PUBLIC NIGHT TEAMFAST. WE

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:57.924
REALLY HAVE HAD MORE PINES OF

01:49:57.991 --> 01:49:59.926
WHAT I MAKE OUR DESPERATION IN

01:49:59.993 --> 01:50:02.662
OUR COMMUNITY- I WOULD SAY THAT

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:04.831
OVERALL WE DO SEE THAT THE

01:50:04.898 --> 01:50:06.866
CRIME RATES ARE CONTINUING TO

01:50:06.933 --> 01:50:09.069
DECREASE. BUT THAT IN CERTAIN

01:50:09.135 --> 01:50:11.705
AREAS ESPECIALLY- AS PEOPLE

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:13.373
HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED IF PEOPLE

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.675
HAVE BEEN ON HOW WE HAVE SEEN

01:50:15.742 --> 01:50:16.977
CERTAIN CRIMES SUCH AS THE

01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:18.044
CATEGORIES THAT YOU HAVE

01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:20.113
MENTIONED- TAKE FLIGHT IN

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:22.849
KUWAIT. AND SO- I DON'T THINK

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:25.185
THAT THAT REALLY ALL CLOSE TO

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:26.486
WHETHER OR NOT I POLICIES

01:50:26.553 --> 01:50:28.321
OVERALL ARE WORKING I REALLY

01:50:28.388 --> 01:50:29.556
THINK HE GOES TO THE CONDITIONS

01:50:29.622 --> 01:50:30.690
UNDER WHICH WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:37.630
IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO. AS

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:38.231
WE'VE BEEN CUT NINETEEN. SO I

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:39.299
WOULD JUST YOU KNOW. SAY THE

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:40.367
THERE HAS BEEN A STUDY THAT

01:50:40.433 --> 01:50:41.368
SHOWN THE SINCE PROPERTIES

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:41.968
PROPERTIES THAT HAS NOT- HAS

01:50:42.035 --> 01:50:43.870
AND- EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC

01:50:43.937 --> 01:50:45.872
AND YES I WOULD AGREE THAT. ON

01:50:45.939 --> 01:50:47.040
THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN A LOT OF

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.508
PEOPLE IN VERY DESPERATE

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:51.077
SITUATION SO WE WOULD EXPECT TO

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:55.081
SEE SOME OF THESE. CRIMES IS-

01:50:55.148 --> 01:50:57.817
THE OTHER QUESTION I THINK-

01:50:57.884 --> 01:51:02.255
SEAN. THAT'S YOUR MONEY IF I IF

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:04.724
I MAY HAVE BEEN TOO IS THAT I

01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:05.792
DO BELIEVE WE'VE SEEN AN

01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:07.627
INCREASE M. FROM PROP FORTY

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:08.828
SEVEN THAT WE HAVE SEEN

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:10.730
PROPERTY CRIMES GO UP BUT WHAT

01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:13.066
I THINK IS THE REASON WHY IS WE

01:51:13.133 --> 01:51:13.867
DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:15.969
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM FOR IT I

01:51:16.036 --> 01:51:17.670
KNOW AT LEAST IN MY COUNTY

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:19.572
THERE'S LIMITED CAPABILITIES OF

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:21.908
DOING A DEFLECTION OR DIVERSION

01:51:21.975 --> 01:51:24.811
IN THESE CASES- AND THAT IS

01:51:24.878 --> 01:51:27.647
REALLY AT IT TIED THE HANDS OF

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:30.450
VESTED TO CONNECT TO DIVERT. A

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:31.885
YEAR AND I THINK THE OTHER

01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:33.720
ISSUE OU SEEN THE INCREASING

01:51:33.787 --> 01:51:35.755
CRIME HAS BEEN IDENTITY THEFT

01:51:35.822 --> 01:51:37.791
NOT FOR SURE HAS HAPPENED IN IN

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:39.292
MOST CITIES ACROSS THE UNITED

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:40.593
STATES AND I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:41.995
YOU CAN NECESSARILY CORRELATION

01:51:42.062 --> 01:51:43.663
IS BETWEEN THOSE SPIKES BECAUSE

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:45.632
A PROP FORTY SEVEN OR THE LACK

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:47.167
OF POVERTY HAS INCREASED WITH

01:51:47.233 --> 01:51:48.501
THE INCREASE IN OUR COMMUNITY

01:51:48.568 --> 01:51:50.270
SIGNIFICANTLY SO HERE IN SAN

01:51:50.336 --> 01:51:52.772
JOAQUIN COUNTY 25% OF MY OF MY

01:51:52.839 --> 01:51:53.673
COMMUNITY LIVES AT OR BELOW THE

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.909
POVERTY LEVEL ON TOP OF THAT

01:51:55.975 --> 01:51:58.812
15% CANNOT SUSTAIN. A FOUR

01:51:58.878 --> 01:51:59.412
HUNDRED DOLLAR MEDICAL

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.514
EMERGENCY SO 40% OF MY

01:52:01.581 --> 01:52:02.549
COMMUNITY IS STRUGGLING

01:52:02.615 --> 01:52:04.417
ECONOMICALLY AND I THINK THAT

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:05.985
PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN REALLY

01:52:06.052 --> 01:52:07.587
SEEING THE INCREASE IN POVERTY

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:09.522
LEVEL OFFENSES AND THOSE ARE

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:11.458
GOING TO BE THEFT RELATED- AND

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:12.358
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SUBSTANCE

01:52:12.425 --> 01:52:13.993
USE MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.728
THAT I'M DEALING WITH ON LARGE

01:52:15.795 --> 01:52:17.330
SCALE IDENTITY THEFT CASES

01:52:17.397 --> 01:52:18.431
WHICH ARE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

01:52:18.498 --> 01:52:20.600
AND HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS- ARE

01:52:20.667 --> 01:52:22.569
ARE REALLY DRIVEN BY SUBSTANCE

01:52:22.635 --> 01:52:24.604
SUBSTANCE. SUBSTANCE UNTREATED

01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:27.307
MENTAL HEALTH I HAVE FORTY BEDS

01:52:27.373 --> 01:52:29.943
IN RECOVERY I'M SEVEN HUNDRED

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:30.510
FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN MY

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:32.712
COMMUNITY YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:34.981
SHORT ON THE ABILITY TO TAKE

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:36.483
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ARE ARE

01:52:36.549 --> 01:52:38.184
USING THEFT AS A MECHANISM TO

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:39.586
SUPPORT A HABIT OR MENTAL

01:52:39.652 --> 01:52:41.554
HEALTH OR POVERTY AND REALLY

01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:43.490
PLACE THEM IN A SITUATION WHERE

01:52:43.556 --> 01:52:44.624
WE CAN REALLY ADDRESS THEIR

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:46.426
NEEDS SO WE HAVE WE HAVE SEEN

01:52:46.493 --> 01:52:48.228
IT- BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE

01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:49.762
CORRELATION IS NECESSARILY

01:52:49.829 --> 01:52:51.364
BECAUSE OF FORTY SEVEN SOME

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:52.365
PEOPLE MIGHT THINK ONE ONLY

01:52:52.432 --> 01:52:53.199
GONNA GET A MISDEMEANOR BUT

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:54.234
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO GET A

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.768
MISDEMEANOR IF THAT'S THE CASE.

01:52:55.835 --> 01:52:57.904
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS A

01:52:57.971 --> 01:53:03.510
TREMENDOUS SPIKE. IN POVERTY

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:04.511
AND I BELIEVE WHEN KOBE WINDS

01:53:04.577 --> 01:53:06.546
DOWN. THE ECONOMIC FOR BE. YOU

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:07.514
KNOW A BIG BIG FAN AS WELL SO.

01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:08.915
WE'LL SEE. MY NEXT QUESTION

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:10.450
HAVE TO QUESTION THIS QUESTIONS

01:53:10.517 --> 01:53:12.452
AND ONE MORE QUESTION- IS TO

01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:15.955

CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE HAVE

01:53:19.125 --> 01:53:21.161
EIGHTY. AT CRISIS LEVEL

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:24.297
HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM- DRUG

01:53:24.364 --> 01:53:27.300
EPIDEMIC MATH UP ATOMIC BOMB

01:53:27.367 --> 01:53:28.835
AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AT OUR

01:53:28.902 --> 01:53:31.171
HANDS AND IT SEEMS LIKE THOSE

01:53:31.237 --> 01:53:35.475
ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED AS WELL.

01:53:35.542 --> 01:53:37.644

READ WHAT YOU KNOW ARE SOME OF

01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:42.182
THE OFFICIALS- FROM BOTH LAPD

01:53:43.917 --> 01:53:47.387
SPOKEN ON HIS. SENSE IT HAS

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:49.255
BEEN REGULATED NOW DOWN TO A

01:53:49.322 --> 01:53:52.158
MISDEMEANOR THAT IS- POSSESSION

01:53:52.225 --> 01:53:53.326
ARE THERE IS MORE OF A

01:53:53.393 --> 01:53:54.594
REVOLVING DOOR WE DON'T HAVE

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:56.129
THE ABILITY TO HAVE PEOPLE GO

01:53:56.196 --> 01:53:57.897
INTO TREATMENT FACILITIES LIKE

01:53:57.964 --> 01:53:59.966
WE HAD BEFORE SO IT HAD SOME

01:54:00.033 --> 01:54:02.101
EFFECT ON THE STREET LEVEL. AND

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:03.870
THE MAYOR GARCETTI SAYS ALSO I

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:05.605
AGREE WITH THEM IF SOMEBODY

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:07.040
GETS ARRESTED THEY'RE NOT GOING

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:08.441
TO SERVE ANY JAIL TIME IF THEY

01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:09.943
DO SERVE TIME IN JAIL THEY'RE

01:54:10.009 --> 01:54:11.744
NOT GOING TO BE PROSECUTED. IF

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:13.112
THEY DON'T GET PROSECUTED IF

01:54:13.179 --> 01:54:14.514
THEY DO GET PROSECUTED THEY'RE

01:54:14.581 --> 01:54:16.049
NOT GOING TO BE SENTENCED AND

01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:18.251
IF THEIR SENTENCE THERE OUT

01:54:18.318 --> 01:54:20.286
RIGHT AWAY. IT'S A BROKEN

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:22.755
SYSTEM. I'D LIKE TO KNOW YOUR

01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:25.391
THOUGHTS ON THE SYSTEM BEING

01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:30.730
BROKEN. AND HOW WE- NEED TO

01:54:30.797 --> 01:54:33.499
INTERVENE- TWO TWO TWO

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:36.836
SOMETIMES DEMAND TREATMENT-

01:54:36.903 --> 01:54:37.437
BECAUSE IT IS ALSO INCREASING

01:54:37.503 --> 01:54:41.140
CRIME. SO MOST OF THE

01:54:41.207 --> 01:54:43.376
LITERATURE THAT I'VE READ SEEMS

01:54:43.443 --> 01:54:44.477
TO INDICATE THAT PORCH

01:54:44.544 --> 01:54:46.079
TREATMENT IT'S NOT A SMALL

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:48.181
BOOKS NOT AS SUCCESSFUL AS

01:54:48.248 --> 01:54:50.683
VOLUNTARY CARE AND TREATMENT

01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:51.718
FOR PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE

01:54:51.784 --> 01:54:53.720
DISORDER SEEMS TO BE THE FOCUS

01:54:53.786 --> 01:54:55.455
OF YOUR COMMENTS ON WHAT EXPERT

01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:58.191
IN THIS AREA. BUT I HAVE TO

01:54:58.258 --> 01:54:59.892
THINK ABOUT THE MASS

01:54:59.959 --> 01:55:01.494
INCARCERATION THAT RESULTED ON

01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:02.829
FELONY PROSECUTIONS FOR DRUG

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:05.498
POSSESSION. ON WERE NOT

01:55:05.565 --> 01:55:07.800
HELPFUL. THERE WERE TOO MANY

01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:08.768
PEOPLE IN STATE PRISON IN

01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:11.371
COUNTY JAIL AND EVEN WHEN YOU

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:14.607
HAVE FORCED ON CARE PORSCHE

01:55:14.674 --> 01:55:16.442
TREATMENT. THAT HAS TO BE

01:55:16.509 --> 01:55:18.878
MATCHED WITH SOME RESOURCES TO

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:19.812
PROVIDE CARE AND TREATMENT

01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:21.781
WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN THE CASE

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:23.883
AND SO I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:25.585
IS FELONY PROSECUTIONS FOR

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:27.954
SIMPLE POSSESSION. ON TO END

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:29.656
HOMELESSNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:32.125
DISORDER ARREST I DON'T THE

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:33.693
ANSWER IS SERVICE SERVICE THERE

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:35.962
ARE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES WE

01:55:36.029 --> 01:55:39.198
ARE HARM REDUCTION-

01:55:39.265 --> 01:55:41.534
ORGANIZATION THATBELIEVES THAT

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:43.169
YOU HAVE TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:45.872
THEY ARE. GET THEM STABILIZED

01:55:45.938 --> 01:55:47.140
IN THE COMMUNITY AND BEGAN

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:48.274
DEALING WITH HER ON THAT HE HAD

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:49.642
REAL HEALTH NEEDS WHETHER IT'S

01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:51.377
MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE

01:55:51.444 --> 01:55:54.347
DISORDERS- I'M NOT SURE THAT IF

01:55:54.414 --> 01:55:55.748
THE MAYOR SAYING WE NEED FELONY

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:58.918
PROSECUTIONS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL

01:55:58.985 --> 01:56:00.086
IN PROVIDING TREATMENT THAT I

01:56:00.153 --> 01:56:01.721
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT BUT I'M

01:56:01.788 --> 01:56:03.956
NOT SURE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT.

01:56:04.023 --> 01:56:10.229

JUST- FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE

01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:19.839
ARRESTED AND- TRAFFICKING AND

01:56:19.906 --> 01:56:21.741
THOSE FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE. ON

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.242
THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE MEETING

WE LOOKED AT IT AGAIN. AS DOING

STREET I BROUGHT OUR FOOD IN

01:59:40.206 --> 01:59:41.541
THE HOPES OF TRYING TO GET HER

01:59:41.607 --> 01:59:43.543

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:45.745

01:59:53.452 --> 01:59:54.353
HE SAID YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA

01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:55.888

YOU I'LL KILL HER TOO. THERE

01:59:57.523 --> 01:59:59.225
WAS NO IF ANDS OR BUTS. IT IS A

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:00.793
VERY VIOLENT WORLD. AND IT IS A

02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:02.562
VERY DANGEROUS WORLD AND IF WE

02:00:02.628 --> 02:00:04.497
NEED TO HAVE. TO UNDERSTAND

02:00:04.564 --> 02:00:05.998
THAT WE CANNOT JUST GO GET

02:00:06.065 --> 02:00:07.033
SOMEBODY OFF THE STREET AND

02:00:07.099 --> 02:00:09.201
EXPECT IT TO BE PERFECT. BUT

02:00:09.268 --> 02:00:09.936
THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN AND

02:00:10.002 --> 02:00:11.571
THEY'RE GOING TO TRAVEL- I TO

02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:13.105
ADVOCATES THAT ARE HUMAN

02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:15.007
TRAFFICKING VICTIMS SURVIVORS.

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:17.109
IT TOOK ONE TEN YEARS. AND THE

02:00:17.176 --> 02:00:18.511
OTHER TWO YEARS BEFORE WE CAN

02:00:18.578 --> 02:00:20.513
FINALLY MOVE THEM. OUT OF THE

LIFESTYLE IF YOU WILL. IN INTO

02:00:22.148 --> 02:00:23.716
SAFETY. SO I THINK THAT IF

02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:24.617
YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT

02:00:24.684 --> 02:00:25.585

ESPECIALLY WE'RE SEEING SUCH AN

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:28.187
INCREASE WITH THE INTERNET.

02:00:28.254 --> 02:00:29.922
OBVIOUSLY AND- READILY

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:31.324
AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. BUT

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:32.425
WE'RE SEEING IT ON THE STREET

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:33.559
IN THE- YOU KNOW IN THE OLD

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:35.161
DAYS ON THE BLADE RIGHT NOW.

02:00:35.227 --> 02:00:37.163
ANYBODY THAT LOOKS UNDER

02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:38.264
EIGHTEEN IS GOING FOR TWO TO

02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:40.199
THREE TIMES THE MARKET VALUE-

02:00:40.266 --> 02:00:41.334
THERE'S A YEAH I MEAN I COULD

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:42.602
TELL YOU HORRIFIC STORIES BUT I

02:00:42.668 --> 02:00:47.807
DON'T WANT TO TRAUMATIZE.

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:48.374
EVERYBODY'S MONEY BUT IT'S A

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:48.908
CRITICAL ISSUE. IT'S AN X.

02:00:48.975 --> 02:00:49.842
ISSU. AS WE AND I. MEAN TO.

02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:50.643
AND I ON IT. BUT THE HEALING.

02:00:50.710 --> 02:00:52.912
OF THE TRAFFIC VICTIMS IF YOU

02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:55.247
YEARS AND YEARS IN THE MAKING.

02:00:55.314 --> 02:00:57.984
AND THAT AND IT'S VERY COMPLEX.

02:00:58.050 --> 02:00:58.951
AND SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY

02:00:59.018 --> 02:01:01.220
SUPPORT. ON BOTH SIDES WE NEED

02:01:01.287 --> 02:01:02.488
MORE INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:03.789
BECAUSE MOST OF THIS IS

02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:06.225
HAPPENING ONLINE- AND THOUGH I

02:01:06.292 --> 02:01:07.526
STILL HAVE A HIGH POPULATION ON

02:01:07.593 --> 02:01:09.295
THE STREET. LIKE I SAID. AND

02:01:09.362 --> 02:01:10.696
THEN THE OTHER PART IS THE

02:01:10.763 --> 02:01:12.465
HEALING VERY CRITICAL FOR US TO

02:01:12.531 --> 02:01:13.599
THANK YOU FOR SHINING A LIGHT

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:15.835
ON THIS. IT IS CRITICAL. THANK

02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:19.472
YOU. MISTER DANCER I THANK YOU

02:01:19.538 --> 02:01:21.540
AND THANK EVERYONE FOR THESE

02:01:21.607 --> 02:01:25.177
QUESTIONS- FOR ME- BECAUSE I'VE

02:01:25.244 --> 02:01:26.679
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN DOING THIS

02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:28.781
FOR QUITE AWHILE- AND I'M KIND

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:32.518
OF. TIRED OF ANECDOTAL.

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:34.654
SUGGESTIONS OF WHAT'S GOING ON

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:35.688
I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE MAKING

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:38.391
CLAIMS AND IT IS WE'RE NOT A

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:39.158
POINT WHERE WE NOT HAVE TO HAVE

02:01:39.225 --> 02:01:42.261
ACCOUNTABILITY IN FACT WE

02:01:42.328 --> 02:01:42.828
PROBABLY NEED A THIRD PARTY

02:01:42.895 --> 02:01:45.598
GROUP. TO KIND OF LOOK AT THIS

02:01:45.665 --> 02:01:49.235
ISSUE. AND DOCUMENTED BUT ALSO

02:01:49.301 --> 02:01:54.674
COME UP WITH- WITH THE SPECIFIC-

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:57.176
DATA THAT SHOWS WHETHER IT'S

02:01:57.243 --> 02:01:58.611
LOCKED THEM UP AND THROW AWAY

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:00.279
THE KEY AND KEEP HIM IN CARCERI

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:02.314
LONGER OR WE DO THE WRAPAROUND

02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:05.084
SERVICES BUT WE NEED TO GO OUT

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:07.386
TO THESE COMMUNITY GROUPS. AND

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:08.988
FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE

02:02:09.055 --> 02:02:11.123
PROGRAMS ACTUALLY WORK AND IF

02:02:11.190 --> 02:02:13.959
AND IF THEY DO THEN WE NEED TO

02:02:14.026 --> 02:02:15.895
GIVE MORE MONEY TO THE PROGRAMS

02:02:15.961 --> 02:02:18.864
THAT WORK AND DIVERT MONEY SOME

02:02:18.931 --> 02:02:21.400
ONES THAT DON'T. CONVERSELY IF

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:22.702
THERE SOME PRISON PROGRAMS TO

02:02:22.768 --> 02:02:25.104
JAIL PROGRAMS THAT WORK WE NEED

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:27.239
TO FUND THOSE TWO IF THERE'S

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:30.109
ANOTHER MIDWAY- WE CAN HANDLE

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:32.678
ALL THESE PROBLEMS- THAT HAVE

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:33.946
THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:02:34.013 --> 02:02:35.581
SOLVE. THEM WE NEED TO

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:37.216
COLLABORATE TOGETHER THE REASON

02:02:37.283 --> 02:02:38.884
I SAY A THIRD PARTY GROUP WHICH

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:40.586
I AM I MAY EVEN RECOMMEND TO

02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:42.455
THIS COMMITTEE THAT WILL DO THE

02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:44.156
DATA COLLECTION AND ACTUALLY

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:46.025
LOOK AT WHAT PROGRAMS THAT WORK

02:02:46.092 --> 02:02:49.028
MORE DON'T WORK. IS THAT WE

02:02:49.095 --> 02:02:49.995
WE'VE GOT TO STOP FIGHTING OVER

02:02:50.062 --> 02:02:53.599
THE MONTH AND WE NEED TO DIRECT

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:54.834
THE MONEY TO WEAR. THINGS ARE

02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:56.902
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. I'M FROM

02:02:56.969 --> 02:02:58.938
FIRM BELIEVER THAT MAYBE ONE

02:02:59.004 --> 02:03:01.040
PERSON. NEEDED TO BE DETAINED

02:03:01.107 --> 02:03:03.743
AND- BROUGHT INTO A DRUG

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:05.044
PROGRAM AND THERE'S PROBABLY A

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:06.679
LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT BE NEED

02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:08.981
TO BE VOLUNTARILY SUBMIT

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:10.716
THEMSELVES BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET

02:03:10.783 --> 02:03:13.486
TO THE AS AS THE PROP 47-57

02:03:13.552 --> 02:03:15.421
POKER TALKING ABOUT. WE'VE GOT

02:03:15.488 --> 02:03:17.757
TO GET TO THE CORE ISSUE. WE

02:03:17.823 --> 02:03:19.558
CAN'T JUST PUT BANDAIDS ON

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:21.293
THINGS AND BANDAIDS OR THINGS

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:22.461
WE REALLY GOT TO GET TO THE

02:03:22.528 --> 02:03:23.763
CORE ISSUES AND THAT'S REALLY

02:03:23.829 --> 02:03:26.866
REALLY HARD WORK AND- BECAUSE

02:03:26.932 --> 02:03:28.434
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT-

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:30.102
PEOPLE DELIGHT BOGUS AND TO.

02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:32.972
TURN OVER OVERNIGHT AND SO I IF

02:03:33.038 --> 02:03:35.808
THERE'S A WAY. THAT BOTH SIDES

02:03:35.875 --> 02:03:37.943
CAN COME TO US AND GET MAYBE

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:41.113
EVEN TALK TO A THIRD PARTY-

02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:42.414
MADAM CHAIRED A THIRD PARTY

02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:44.216
GROUP THAT COULD COME UP WITH

02:03:44.283 --> 02:03:47.286
SOME. WAYS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM A

02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:50.890
LOT BETTER AND I INVITE INPUT

02:03:50.956 --> 02:03:52.324
FROM YOU OPTION ONE. BY M.

02:03:52.391 --> 02:03:53.626
COULD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

02:03:53.692 --> 02:03:55.361
THEN NOW YOU JUST ADVOCATES BUT

02:03:55.427 --> 02:03:57.563
JUST COMMUNITY FOLKS TO SAY OR

02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:59.598
EVEN PEOPLE WHO WERE IN A LIFE

02:03:59.665 --> 02:04:01.433
OR OR COMMITTING THE CRIME TO

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:05.371
SAY WHAT. COULD WE HAVE DONE.

02:04:05.437 --> 02:04:06.639
TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T

02:04:06.705 --> 02:04:08.240
PARTICIPATE IN ANY OF THESE

02:04:08.307 --> 02:04:11.944
ADVERSE- INDUSTRIES OR OR OR

02:04:12.011 --> 02:04:13.479
CRIMES BECAUSE AT THE END OF

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:15.881
THE DAY- WE'VE GOT TO GET TO

02:04:15.948 --> 02:04:16.949
THE CORE ISSUES IN THE ESTES

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:18.684
PARK YES IT'S ON. THE

02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:20.486
ENVIRONMENT YOU GREW UP IN YES

02:04:20.553 --> 02:04:22.521
W. SAYS YES IS THE MENTAL

02:04:22.588 --> 02:04:25.357
HEALTH ASPECT OF IT WHICH A LOT

02:04:25.424 --> 02:04:26.826
OF US DON'T EVEN WANT TO DEAL

02:04:26.892 --> 02:04:28.127
WITH WE JUST KIND OF GLOSS

02:04:28.194 --> 02:04:29.762
OVER. BUT THAT MAY BE THE MOST

02:04:29.829 --> 02:04:31.730
CRITICAL PART OF THIS OF THIS

02:04:31.797 --> 02:04:35.267
WHOLE CRIMINALITY. IS THAT- OF

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:36.669
WHAT PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE HAVE

02:04:36.735 --> 02:04:39.238
GONE THROUGH AT A YOUNG AGE.

02:04:39.305 --> 02:04:41.373
YOU KOW YOU YOU YOU KNOW WHAT

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.474
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:45.211
ARE IN A LIFE. AS IF THEY JUST

02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:47.079
DECIDED TO BE IN IT BUT THEY

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:48.914
MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT AT TEN OR

02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:50.449
ELEVEN BY A BY A SPOT BY A

02:04:50.516 --> 02:04:53.085
PARENT. BY ONGOING NOT. AND

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:54.787
THEN YOU WONDER WHY THEY'RE ON

02:04:54.854 --> 02:04:56.755
THE STREET AT EIGHTEEN A MAYBE

02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:59.191
BECAUSE- ALL OF THAT STUFF THAT

02:04:59.258 --> 02:04:59.959
HAPPENED THAT THEY WON'T TALK

02:05:00.025 --> 02:05:02.161
TO YOU ABOUT. AND IT WE ALSO

02:05:02.228 --> 02:05:03.629
NEED TO QUANTIFY IT NOW LEAVE

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:04.830
YOU WITH THIS QUANTITY IF WE

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:07.166
QUANTIFY IT. ESPECIALLY THE

02:05:07.233 --> 02:05:10.069
COST. WHICH IS REALLY HARD

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:10.836
BECAUSE REALLY IT'S EASY TO

02:05:10.903 --> 02:05:13.339
SAY. X. AMOUNT OF ROBBERIES X.

02:05:13.405 --> 02:05:14.540
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ARE HUMAN

02:05:14.607 --> 02:05:15.774
TRAFFICKING X. AMOUNT OF

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:17.776
MURDERS AND THAT COST X. AMOUNT

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:20.579
OF COST AVOIDANCE. IS REALLY

02:05:20.646 --> 02:05:24.116
DIFFICULT. TO QUANTIFY IF I

02:05:24.183 --> 02:05:24.783
TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE THIS

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:26.952
PROGRAM. X. AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

02:05:27.019 --> 02:05:27.786
DID NOT RECEIVE THE BAIT THEN

02:05:27.853 --> 02:05:30.389
WE SHOULD SAY WE HAD X. AMOUNT

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:32.725
OF SAVINGS. BUT HOW MANY OF

02:05:32.791 --> 02:05:34.593
THEM DID NOT COMMIT A MURDER

02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:35.895
HOW MANY OF THEM DID NOT BREAK

02:05:35.961 --> 02:05:37.196
INTO SOMEONE'S HIGH MANY OF

02:05:37.263 --> 02:05:39.131
THEM. THAT STUFF THAT'S REALLY

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:41.800
THE HARD PART TO TRY TO GET TO

02:05:41.867 --> 02:05:43.335
THAT AND WE REALLY SHOULD.

02:05:43.402 --> 02:05:45.471
BECAUSE COST AVOIDANCE IS HUGE

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:46.839
AND WHAT PEOPLE DO WITH PROP

02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:50.075
47-57. THAT I THINK THAT NUMBER

02:05:50.142 --> 02:05:54.713
IS. IS WILL DWARF. BUT I NEED

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:57.149
DATA. I NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAVE-

02:05:57.216 --> 02:05:58.884
TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE

02:05:58.951 --> 02:06:01.053
WE'RE DOING ALL THESE PROGRAMS-

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.788
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT HAVE

02:06:02.855 --> 02:06:04.356
TO DO AS MUCH AND THEN THEY CAN

02:06:04.423 --> 02:06:06.592
CONCENTRATE. ON MAY BE GOING TO

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:08.327
THE REALLY SERIOUS ONE SO. IF

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:10.496
YOU. IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH

02:06:10.562 --> 02:06:12.498
ME I WOULD REALLY GOING TO TRY

02:06:12.564 --> 02:06:16.068
TO FIGURE OUT A- AN INDEPENDENT

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:17.970
SOURCE TO DO THE KIND OF THE

02:06:18.037 --> 02:06:20.272
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES SO THAT

02:06:20.339 --> 02:06:22.408
WE BRING BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE.

02:06:22.474 --> 02:06:23.542
THESE ARE THE NUMBERS THESE ARE

02:06:23.609 --> 02:06:26.912
THE ACTUAL NUMBERS AND- AND WE

02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:29.081
WERE NOT TAKEN KINDA ANECDOTAL

02:06:29.148 --> 02:06:31.050
ANALYSIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

02:06:31.116 --> 02:06:32.518
I MEAN WE'VE BEEN GOING BACK

02:06:32.584 --> 02:06:33.686
AND FORTH BACK FORCES I GOT

02:06:33.752 --> 02:06:35.321
HERE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE

02:06:35.387 --> 02:06:35.888
WE'RE STILL DOING THE SAME

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:38.490
THING BUT WE GOT TO BRING IN

02:06:38.557 --> 02:06:44.763
MORE DATA. SO THANK YOU. I WANT

02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:47.766
TO THANK THE PANELISTS- A LOT

02:06:47.833 --> 02:06:50.602
OF THESE POLICIES- ARE YOUNG

02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:51.904
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR NINE YEARS A

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:53.439
LOT OF THESE POLICIES HAVE BEEN

02:06:53.505 --> 02:06:56.275
WORKED ON SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE-

02:06:56.342 --> 02:06:59.478
IT TAKES TIME- INDIVIDUALS ARE

02:06:59.545 --> 02:07:00.813
NOT GOING TO OVERCOME TRAUMAS

02:07:00.879 --> 02:07:03.082
THAT AND- THE AND THE FIRST

02:07:03.148 --> 02:07:05.150
STEP OFTENTIMES AND SO. THAT

02:07:05.217 --> 02:07:09.488
DATA IS IMPORTANT- BOOK. IN

02:07:09.555 --> 02:07:11.256
THEM IN THE END- I THINK WE

02:07:11.323 --> 02:07:12.791
NEED TO RELY ON BUT THE

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:14.093
COMMUNITY THE EXPERTS ARE

02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:15.661
TALKING TO US ABOUT THE WORKING

02:07:15.728 --> 02:07:18.564
WITH COMPASSION. OFF WITH THEIR

02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:20.366
COMMUNITIES OUT THERE. ASTERION

02:07:20.432 --> 02:07:23.168
COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS THE FORMER

02:07:23.235 --> 02:07:26.805
CLASSROOM TEACHER- HIGH SCHOOL

02:07:26.872 --> 02:07:28.640
TEACHER I WOULD OFTEN HAVE TO

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:29.708
REMIND MYSELF THAT THESE WERE

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:31.844
KIDS- AND WHEN THEY MADE A

02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:33.145
MISTAKE THAT THE SERVE SECOND

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:35.247
CHANCES AND OFTEN SCIENCES I

02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:36.548
HAD A DISCUSSION WITH THEM IT

02:07:36.615 --> 02:07:38.250
WAS. THE SITUATION THAT LEAD

02:07:38.317 --> 02:07:39.451
THEM DOWN A PATH WITH THAT THEY

02:07:39.518 --> 02:07:40.953
WERE NOT IS REALLY HAPPY WITH

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:41.487
THAT THE FATHER HAD OTHER

02:07:41.553 --> 02:07:43.522
CHOICES OUT THERE ON AND SO I

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:46.692
JUST DO THINK THAT- WE NEED TO

02:07:46.759 --> 02:07:47.226
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:49.361
STAKEHOLDERS TO. TO FIGURE THIS

02:07:49.428 --> 02:07:51.196
OUT NOT JUST BECAUSE I BUDGET I

02:07:51.263 --> 02:07:52.598
NEED TO SEE WHAT THESE ARE

02:07:52.664 --> 02:07:54.199
HUMAN BEINGS EVER TALKING ABOUT

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:55.434
OF ANY TO THAT NEED A SENSE OF

02:07:55.501 --> 02:07:56.602
WHAT THAT I'M GOING TO BE
