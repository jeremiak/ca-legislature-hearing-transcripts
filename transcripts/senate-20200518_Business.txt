PART WITH THAT NEXT UP WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR MORE LOCK- I FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE SB TEN FIFTY THREE CENTER MORLOCK IS PRESENT WELCOME. BIGELOW FORTY YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SHAPED YOUR- WILLINGNESS TO HEAR THIS BILL SO MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES GOOD MORNING. CURRENTLY REGISTERED NURSES MOVING TO CALIFORNIA. HAVE TO WAIT SOME NINETY DAYS TO BE APPROVED BY THE STATE IN ORDER TO PURSUE THEIR PROFESSION. THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN THIRTY FOUR STATES. THE STATE'S PARTICIPATE IN THE NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT. SB TEN FIFTY THREE WOULD HAVE CALIFORNIA BECOME A MEMBER OF THIS NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES. TO THIS PRIVILEGE. IN THE CASE OF AN EMERGENCY LIKE A SEVERE EARTHQUAKE NUMEROUS LICENSE NURSES. FROM THE CURRENT THIRTY FOUR STATES COULD COME TO CALIFORNIA TO ASSIST IMMEDIATELY. THE STANDARDS MAINTAINED BY THE NURSE LICENSURE BOARDS ARE FOLLOWED NATIONALLY AND MEET OR EXCEED CALIFORNIA'S. CALIFORNIA REGISTERED NURSES THAT ALSO FLY TO ONE OF THE THIRTY FOUR STATES WHEN THEY HAVE A SHORTAGE. OR AN EMERGENCY. WE HAVE BECOME A MULTI STATE NATION FOR MOST INDUSTRIES AND WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT A NATIONWIDE APPROACH IS INEVITABLE. THE THREE ALSO MODERNIZES THE MEDICAL CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM BY ALLOWING GREATER ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH THIS WILL BENEFIT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF MILITARY SPOUSES WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE SIMPLE INTERSTATE SOLUTION. KEEPING INDIVIDUALS EMPLOYED AS CRITICAL NOW MORE THAN EVER. IT WILL IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK IS OPTIONAL REGISTERED NURSES CAN BE CALIFORNIA'S SPECIFIC. AND IT GIVES CALIFORNIA NURSES MORE FLEXIBILITY AND FREEDOM IN DEVELOPING THEIR CAREERS AND RESUMES. TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT SIX MONTHS OR LESS IN OTHER RECIPROCATING STATES PROVIDESA BROADER PERSONAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITY. AND MEETING A CRITICAL NEED IN A LOCATION ADDRESSING AN EMERGENCY ALLOWS FOR EXPANDING A PROFESSIONAL'S JOB AND PURPOSE SATISFACTION. IT ALSO PROVIDES ANOTHER WAY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO DEVELOP BETTER WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER STATES. STATES WITH RESIDENT TO MAY BE SUBSIDIZING. OUR STATE TO NEED AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR I APPLAUD THE CONSULTANTS THOROUGHNESS AND ADDRESSING THE WHAT I WOULD CALL A MERGER AND ACQUISITION TYPE OF THE CONCERNS. OF ADOPTING A NEW RELATIONSHIP. IT OCCURS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO. HOWEVER I KEPT A DISAGREEMENT WITH SOME OF THE REPORTS OBSERVATIONS BUT BECAUSE OF LIMITED TIME I WILL GO THROUGH THEM ONE BY ONE. NONE OF THE ISSUES RAISED HOWEVER ARE INSURMOUNTABLE. THIS IS OPTIONAL SO THE AREAS FOR CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE CAN BE ADDRESSED BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS NOT ADOPTING IN. IN OTHER AREAS I'M SURE OUR STATE ADMINISTRATORS ARE UP TO THE CHALLENGE OF INTEGRATING WITH THE COALITION OF INTERSTATE LIKE MINDED PROFESSIONALS. OUT OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND THEIR ROLES IN IT. I BELIEVE THE COMPACT WILL IMPROVE THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. AND HE BOARD OF VOCATIONAL NURSING AND PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS. CALIFORNIA ALREADY PARTICIPATES IN A NUMBER OF INTERSTATE COMMISSIONS. AND MISTER CHAIR I HAVE TWO WITNESSES. AKA FARGE THE DIRECTOR OF STATE ADVOCACY AND LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS. AT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE BOARDS OF NURSING. AND GARY COOPER REPRESENTING AM IN HEALTH CARE. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LOCK THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S GOING TO INVITE- THAT REBEKAH FORCED TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THE BILL I WOULD NOTE TO HER AND TO MISTER COOPER THAT YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL SO HOPEFULLY OF COORDINATED YOUR TESTIMONY TOGETHER OPERATOR WOULD YOU ASK. OPEN UP THE LINE FOR A BACKUP FOR THE POSH. PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD BECCA. HI HI MY NAME IS REBECCA FIVE JOHN WITH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE BOARDS OF NURSING- AND WE WERE THE DRAFTERS OF THAT NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT LANGUAGE AT THE SENATOR STATED THAT THE COMPACT- ESSENTIALLY FUNCTIONS LIKE EIGHT AMADOR DRIVER'S LICENSE AND MATCH A NURSE HAS A LICENSE AND THAT STATE THAT HERE SHE RESIDES AND THEN USES THAT LICENSE TO PRACTICE AND ANY OF THE OTHER THIRTY FOR CONTACT STATE WITHOUT HAVING TO GET REAL LIFE AND- AND THE REASON THAT THAT WORKS SO WELL FOR NURSE LICENSURE A BATCH GENERALLY NURSE. NURSING LICENSE- IT'S PRETTY STANDARD ACROSS THE COUNTRY- ERR THE EDUCATION IS STANDARD- EVERY NURSE BUT TAKE THE AND CRACKS BEFORE SHE CAN GET HER LIFE IN CHURCH AND BECAUSE OF THAT UNIFORMITY IT REALLY LENDS ITSELF TO A COMPACT- AND THEN THE CONTACT AND ALSO IT IT ONE OF THE MAIN FOCUSES ON PATIENT SAFETY BOARD OF NURSING ARE JOINING THIS COMPACT AND THEIR CONCERN IS PATIENT SAFETY SO THEY'RE IN THE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENTS.

NOT AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE'S PATIENCE ON THAT- WE'D LIKE TO BRING THE MATTER NOW BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MEMBERS I HAVE CENTER LEYVA. SENATOR PAN SENATOR HEALTH CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS YOUR FIRST OUR WITNESS SENATOR MORLOCKS SAID THAT LICENSURE IS PRETTY STANDARD ACROSS THE STATE. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM THE OPPOSITION'S OF TESTIMONY THAT IN OTHER STATES. YOU HAVE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GRADUATE FROM A BOARD APPROVED PROGRAM SO I WAS JUST HOPING SOMEONE COULD GIVE ME A LITTLE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA- MISTER CHAIR IS REBEKAH FOX STILL ON THE LINE. CLUTCH CITY HERE THE QUESTION FOR THE CENTER LEYVA. I DID OKAY. YOU'RE WELCOME TO RESPOND. YEAH SO I'M IS PRETTY STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE COUNTRY- WHAT THE OPPOSITION WAS REFERRING TO IS SOME STATES AND HAVE. A CERTAIN PASSION TO OUR GRADUATING FROM NURSING SCHOOL IN ORDER TO GET A LICENSE ON THIS COULD BE OUR MAYBE IF IT WAS A FORMER MILITARY AND THEN THEY ARE ABLE TO USE SOME OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL WORK FOR MILITARY TO TRANSITION INTO A- EITHER- ALBION NO OR A NURSE IN THAT WAY SO THERE ARE SOME- SOME DIFFERENT IN THAT RESPECT- BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THAT HAS NO BEARING ON THE CONTACT YOU. IF REQUIRING IT'S ALLOW DIFFERENT OUR- TO LIGHT GINGER THAT WE REMAIN NOTHING WHICH THAT. IT'S JUST THAT THOSE HER WHO DO HAVE NOT GRADUATED PROMOTE- BORDER TROOPS NURSING PROGRAM. IN SCHOOL. IS ONE OF ELIGIBLE FOR A MULTI STATE LICENSE THEY'RE STILL ELIGIBLE I WOULD ASSUME FOR THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE IT WOULDN'T CHANGE THEIR CURRENT STATUS AT ALL IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE MULTI STATE LICENSE AND THE PURPOSE FROM THAT GROUP FOR THAT IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THAT RICH BACK. ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THERE COULD BE EVEN MORE CHANGES IN THE FUTURE SO IN A CONTACT YOU IF THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE STATE CAN FEEL CONFIDENT THAT YOU KNOW AT THE MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS THE NURSES HAVE GRADUATED FROM- AN APPROVED NURSING SCHOOL. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT SO IF YOU'RE AYE GRADUATE IF I DO NOT GRADUATE FROM A BOARD APPROVED PROGRAM I CURRENT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE A MULTI STATE STATE SINCE. CORRECT YOU WOULD JUST HAVE IF YOU WERE A CALIFORNIA- DID IT THEN YOU WOULD JUST BE OUT I'LL DOUBLE FOR A CALIFORNIA LICENSE NOT HAVE BE MULTI DAY PRIVILEGE AS CRACK SO OTHER AND NURSES IN OTHER STATES WHO DON'T GRADUATE FROM ABOARD APPROVED PROGRAM. WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE A PART OF THIS COMPACT IF CALIFORNIA WERE TO APPROVE THIS. RIGHT IT IT IT IS THE SAME FOR ANY STATE SO. WHAT DAY I AND I'M I DON'T KNOW THAT BUT LET'S SAY THAT TAXES- ALLOW. NURSES WHO HAVE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW I ANSWER SOMETIMES THERE ARE PROGRAMS SO THAT A BIRD I'LL BE AND TO BE CALM AND- ARE AND BUT PERHAPS THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GRADUATED FROM NURSING SCHOOL IN ORDER TO DO THAT I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER EXAMPLE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IT IS APPLIED CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO EVERY NURSE THAT CURRENT THAT HAS A MULTI STATE LICENSE HAVE YOU HAVE HAD GRADUATED FROM A BORDER TROOPS NURSING PROGRAM I NURSING SCHOOL. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE MISTER MODERATOR COULD I HEAR FROM OPPOSITION IF THEY FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THAT. MISTER CHAIR I GUESS I SHOULD ASK YOU I'M SORRY THE OPERATOR WE HAD THAT TO INTO THAT WE HAD THE TWO WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION FROM THE- THE- NURSING ASSOCIATION CAN YOU ASK IF THEY'RE STILL ON THE LINE I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THEM TO COME BACK IN AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. RESPONSES TO CENTER LEYVA. IS THERE LINES AT. THAT LISTED AS A CO HOST JUST I DON'T BELIEVE SO- CENTER LEVERAGE YOUR CALL THEIR NAMES IT DON'T I APOLOGIZE. ON OPERATOR IF YOU COULD ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE REPRESENTING THE NURSES- UNION ON THE LINE IF YOU DID IT THEY THEY GET SO INDICATE SO WE COULD INVITE THEM TO RESPOND. OKAY ANYBODY FOR ME THE NURSES ASSOCIATION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. WE WERE LINE SEVENTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. SEVENTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATOR LABOR- YES SO YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF PLEASE SIR YES MY NAME IS CURTIS LANE WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION SO DOES MENTION BEFORE WITH REGARDS TO EDUCATION AND- THE MODEL LEGISLATION DICTATE THAT IN ORDER FOR APPLICANT TO OBTAIN A MULTI STATE LICENSE YOU MUST HAVE GRADUATED FROM A BOARD APPROVED ARE IN PRE LICENSE OR EDUCATION PROGRAM. AND SO THAT MEANS THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE SELECTION SIR THAT WE'VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING MILITARY OR THE THIRTY UNITS HEALTHY AND ARE AN OPTION AND THE MILITARY EXPERIENCE PERRANCE OPTION THOSE ARE NON GRADUATE PROGRAMS SO NURSES WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE ROUTES TO LICENSOR HAVE NOT GRADUATED FROM BOARD APPROVED PROGRAM AND SO THEY WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR LICENSE UNDER THE CONTACT. THANK YOU. A ONE LAST DID I HEAR ON A YOU SENATOR MORLOCKS SAY THAT THEY WERE THIRTY FOUR STATES THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPACT NOW. OKAY THANK YOU NO MORE QUESTIONS MISTER JACK THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA IT WILL GO TO SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU A- CHAIR- QUESTION- IN TERMS OF IF SO IF CALIFORNIA JOINS THE COMPACT AND THERE IS A NURSE TO IS AN AND OTHERS HE WAS I GUESS ORIGINALLY ISIS AND OTHER STATE IN THE CONTACT AND UNFORTUNATELY IS. HAS TO BE DISCIPLINED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS THE NURSE LOSE HER LICENSE COULD BE HIM HER HAND LICENSE ACROSS THE WHOLE CONTACT JUST CALIFORNIA OR CAN CALIFORNIA NINE ACT ON THIS SO WHAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN TERMS OF DISCIPLINARY OVERSIGHT OVER ANYONE PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA SO THEIR LICENSE IN COLORADO UNDER THE CONTACT AND THE NOW PRACTICING CALIFORNIA CAN CALIFORNIA SANCTION THAT NURSE SO THEY HAVE TO WAIT YOU HAVE TO GO TO CALIFORNIA TO COLORADO TO HAVE THEM SANCTIONED. THANK YOU CENTER PAN MR FOR MASS IF MISS FIGHTS COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION. ARE NOT. OPERATIVE YOU CAN ASK MR A BUNCH TO OPEN UP A PHONE LINE TO SHE COULD RESPOND TO SENATOR PANTS QUESTION. YEAH ON YEAH I'M HERE THANKS THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- SO THE WAY THAT DISCIPLINE WORKS AND THE CONTACT IS THE STATE WHERE THE NURSE IS A LIFE SENTENCE SO WE'LL USE THAT COLORADO CALIFORNIA EXAMPLE I'M SO IN THE STATE OF COLORADO IS THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THAT NURSES LIFE SENTENCE- BECAUSE THEY ARE. THE STATE THAT GRANTED THAT LICENSE SO THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT COULD REVOKE THE LICENSES FUND THE LICENSE OR DISCIPLINE THAT LICENSE- IF THEY DO DO THAT IF IT IS THAT THE PLAN THAT BàN BE PRIVILEGES. HAVE PRACTICE AND ANY CONTACT STATE FOR THAT NURSES ARE DISBANDED UNTIL THE DISCIPLINE HAS BANNED- HAD ENDED. NOW THAT BEING SAD IF THAT COLORADO NURSES PRACTICING AND CALIFORNIA AND THERE THE HARM THAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO STILL DISCIPLINE THE NURSE AND THE SENSE THAT CALIFORNIA HOPE THAT NURSES. WE CALL PRIVILEGED PRACTICE BUT IT'S BETTER YOU REALLY NEED TO PRACTICE. IN CALIFORNIA SO LET'S USE AN EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THAT THAT NURSES- DIVERTING MEDICATION. SO IF CALIFORNIA IF IT CALIFORNIA FIND THAT THAT HAD IVERTED MEDICATION BAY CAN BAND AND CALIFORNIA CAN CHOOSE TO. AB IN A COULD YOU COULD NOT ACT- LOOK MORE THE MOST LIKELY IT WHAT IN IT COULD SHOOT TO THE SPEND- BAT PRIVILEGE TO PRACTICE AWHILE MAYBE THAT NURSE JUST A THOUGHT THE NEW BUDGET. I SOMETHING TO BE A PROGRAM OR HELP COULD REVOKE THAT PRIVILEGE ONE CALIFORNIA WHEN THAT'S GOING ON THAT INVESTIGATIVE PHASE IN MY CALIFORNIA'S DISCIPLINING THE COLUMN RIGHT A NURSE CALIFORNIA HAS TO COMMUNICATE THAT INFORMATION TO COLORADO BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE NURSES ORIGINALLY LIKE. THAT COLORADO'S BANG USE THE INFORMATION FROM CALIFORNIA AND DISCIPLINE THE NURSES LICENSED. SO MAYBE COLORADO. IT ALSO SAYS THAT THE LIGHTS BASE ON WHAT HAPPENED AND CAL. BUT BACK SHARE INFORMATION SHARING IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE COMPACT. AND AGAIN WHEN CALL IF COLORADO AND DID IT IF THE PLAN THE NURSE BASED ON CALIFORNIA'S- INVESTIGATION WHICH IS ABOUT CALL THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES- BAND WHILE THAT NURSES UNDER THAT THE PLAN HER PRIVILEGES TO PRACTICE AND- ANY OF THE STATES WOULD BE SUSPENDED. SO THAT'S KIND OF THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN IF YOU'RE A STATE THAT ISSUE THE LIGHTS AND THE OR IF YOU'RE THE STATE WHERE THAT NURSES PRACTICING. WELL I GUESS I'D SAY IS I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES- THINGS ARE OUT OF AN ANALYSIS THAT- NEED TO BE EXAMINED I THINK DISCIPLINE CERTAINLY IS ONE OF THOSE IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE TO EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OVER THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO PRACTICE IN THE STATE. AND TO BE DEPENDENT ON OF OTHER LICENSING BOARD EXHIBIT CONCERNING AND I THINK NEEDS MUCH FURTHER EXAMINATION AS WELL AS MANY OTHER ISSUES I THINK THAT WERE RAISED A- IN THE TESTIMONY. SO EIGHT NO WE HAVE A PROCESS HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE- LEAD BUYER CHAIR AND ALSO THAT BOTH YOU AND SEND AND ASSEMBLY AND TERMS OF REVIEWING THE VARIOUS BOARDS AND SO FORTH- WHAT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW THIS BILL BEING PRESENTED TODAY AT EIGHT THANK YOU. THIS NEEDS TO BE A MUCH MORE. THOUGHT OUT AND CAREFULLY REVIEWED PROPOSAL AND I DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A SERVICE WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT NATIONALIZING- YEAH. THE POWER TO LICENSES THAT GRANT TO THE STATE THAT'S UNDER THE TENTH AMENDMENT THE CONSTITUTION- AND I THINK THAT- WE NEED HONOR THAT. AND SO- AT THIS POINT UNFORTUNATELY NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK IT NEEDS MUCH FURTHER WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN CENTER HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- THANK YOU YOU'VE ANSWERED. MY QUESTIONS THAT- OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE- **** BUT I JUST WANTED TO. THIS TO MAKE A LITTLE COMMENT I THINK IS USE. INDICATED IN YOUR FIRST STATEMENT THAT THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES TO THIS AND I THINK THERE COULD BE AND IT THERE ARE POTENTIAL. ADVANTAGES FOR OF FOR CALIFORNIA BUT IN LOOKING AT THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACED WITH THE LEGISLATION. AND MOVING TO A- A COMPACT- WITH OTHER STATES FOR OUR- BE AND SO. I THINK WE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WOULD BE DIFFERENT TO THE- LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR AND CALIFORNIA. PRIDES ITSELF ON THE TREMENDOUS HEALTH CARE WE HAVE AND CERTAINLY OUR ENGINE. AND A LV ENDS ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND- I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE STANDARDS THAT WE SET AND THE BOARDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE REGULATIONS THAT WE APPLY. SO I WOULD JUST BE FEARFUL THAT WE WOULD BE GOING DOWN TO. THE SLOPE BUT AT THIS POINT WITHOUT THE SAFEGUARDS IT COULD BE A IN THE LEGISLATION SO UNFORTUNATELY I WILL BE ABLE TO. SUPPORT IT UP TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER HELL ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I'D LIKE TO INVITE IS TERRACE FROM THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING TO COME BACK UP. THE STAIRS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY WAS SHORT. I WANT TO ASK YOU A FEW FOLLOW UPS- SO THERE'S BEEN SOME. CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE DELAYS THAT IT TAKES FOR A SOMEONE WHO'S A PERSON ANOTHER STATE TO COME HERE AND PRACTICE COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT PLEASE. THANK YOU. CAN ABOUT. THE VERY. OF THE- FOR A PERSON COMING IN FROM ANOTHER STATE- WE DO HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT TAKES APPROXIMATELY TEN WEEKS. TO VERIFY THAT LICENSEES THAT ARE COMING IN FROM OTHER STATES AND ONE OF THE REASONS OUR PROCESS IS THE WAY TO DO THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS NOT JUST AN EASY CHECK LIST. OF SHOWING UP IN FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION SENDING IN THE MONEY AND THEN IT'S DOUBT. SO OUR PROCESS IS LENGTHY ONLY BECAUSE OF THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE QUALITY. IS KEPT AT THE LEVEL THAT WE HAVE TODAY. ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THIS TERRACE. THE IT THE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT TO BE A- REGISTERED NURSE WITHIN THE CONTACT THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH HOW MANY RED NURSES THAT WE HAVE LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA THAT THAT DO NOT HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. I AM NOT FAMILIAR AS FAR AS THE EXACT NUMBER BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA YES. THAT IS NOT REQUIRED OR IS REQUIRED IS REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA IS YES. US AT THAT THE YOU CAN'T USE A FEDERAL ID NUMBER. NOW IN PLACE OKAY AND- LASTLY CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF STANDARD SO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL WHAT IS IT THAT WE ARE TRYING TO- ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR VERIFY WHEN YOU DO A REVIEW OF A NURSE WHO'S BEEN LICENSE ANOTHER STATEWIDE TO TAKE TEN WEEKS WHAT AND WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR EXACTLY THE REASON THAT IT TAKES TEN WEEKS IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE REQUIRE FIRST OF FOUR MONTHS WE REQUIRE THAT THE NURSE SUBMIT TRANSCRIPTS. THOSE TRANSCRIPTS IN CALIFORNIA MUST COME FROM THE INSTITUTION IN OTHER STATES THE NURSE CAN JUST SEND THOSE TRANSCRIPTS AND TO THE BOARD THAT IS APPROVING THEIR LICENSURE WE WANT THOSE TRANSCRIPTS TO COME FROM THE STATE OR SOME FOR US OTHER% COUNTRIES FROM THE INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF FRAUD WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FRAUD THAT IS DEALT WITH WITHIN OUR BOARD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME INTO CALIFORNIA PRACTICE. AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS SO IT DOES TAKE A LONG TIME WE HAVE TO HAVE TRANSCRIPTS WE ALSO REQUIRE FINGERPRINTS THOSE FINGERPRINTS ARE NOT SHEARED FROM THE STATE BECAUSE THE EARLY DONE AND SO THIS TAKES- LET THE TIME TO GET ALL OF THIS CRISIS DONE IN PLACE AGAIN I SHOWING THAT THE QUALITY OF THE STANDARDS ARE HIGH OTHER STATES BUT THE REASON DO NOT COMPLICATED. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING. THE FINAL MISTER YOU SPEAK TO THAT OF NURSE SHORTAGES REFERRED LAW OF CALM ARE MANY COMMENTARY. I KNOW THE ANALYSIS RAPPER SOME. STATISTICS IN THAT. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF ARE WE I BALANCE IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF NURSES GOING TO OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS LICENSE AND PRACTICING HERE VERSUS WHAT THE NEED IS. YES THIRTY GLAZER THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK NOT ONLY AMONGST US HERE WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE AMONGST YOU WITHIN A LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO. WITHIN THE MEDIA IN REFERENCE TO NURSING SHORTAGES THERE ARE NURSING SHORTAGES IN SPECIFIC REGIONS ARE CALIFORNIA THERE ARE NOT NURSING SHORTAGES IN AREAS SUCH AS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE FORECAST THE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO US FROM ARE YOU SEE S. F. RESEARCHERS SHOWS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF LICENSE REGISTERED NURSES. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SO THERE ARE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES SOME OF THOSE AREAS WHERE WE SEE THE SHORTAGES ARE IN THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE WORLD- NURSING. BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO SPECIFICALLY WITH US DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT NURSING SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE NURSES THAT USUALLY STATE. WITHIN FIFTY MILES OR SO ON THE PLACES THAT THE GRADUATE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO IS WITH THE INSTITUTIONS BEING ABLE TO RECRUIT NURSES. TO COME AND LIVE IN TO SOME OF THOSE AREAS. WHEN YOU SEE A SERVICE THAT SAME SHORT IN THE THOSE ISOLATE AREAS APPLY TO OTHER AREAS OF HEALTHCARE. POSITIONS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE- IS THAT THE- SAME TYPE OF AN ISSUE IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS IN CERTAIN PLACES A CALIFORNIA. ABSOLUTELY I WOULDN'T TRY TO SPEAK FROM THE DOCTORS BUT I CAN'T SAY THE FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS I KNOW THAT WE ALWAYS LOOK AT THE FACT THAT MOST OF THOSE AREAS USE NURSE PRACTITIONERS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT RECRUIT DOCTORS. TO BE THERE AND BECAUSE OF THAT- THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR NURSES TO BE TOOK TO BECAUSE THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE pTHEN THEY BECOME REGISTERED NURSES SO THAT IS THE SHORTEST IS THERE THOSE NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE WORK IN THOSE AREAS A LOT OF. ONCE THEY GET TO A POINT WHERE RETURN GONE. EFFORTS TO GET TO MOVE INTO THOSE AREAS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND FINALLY A TERRORIST SO OBVIOUSLY WERE. CURRENT THAT PANDEMIC AT THE GOVERNOR HAS MAKE CALLS FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSION THE COMMON. AND BE AVAILALE TO ASSIST AND- CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHETHER AT AND I UNDERSTAND TO THE IMPULSES THAT SIXTEEN HUNDRED. THE NURSES THAT YOU A PROCESS UNDER HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER EMERGENCY POWERS TO ALLOWED TO PRACTICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT CORRECT SIXTEEN HUNDRED SO FAR. I'M NOT SURE THAT NUMBER'S CORRECT- THAT IS THROUGH HIM SO THE FEMUR I THINK IT'S EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TORTILLA MAY HAVE THE AFTERNOON INCORRECT BUT THAT DOES NOT COME DIRECTLY THROUGH US WE'RE AWARE WHAT IS GOING ON- BUT THAT DOES NOT COME THROUGH US. THAT ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY CURRENT SHORTAGES IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. TERMS OF NURSES AVAILABILITY OF NURSES NO WE ARE NOT AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE ARE SOME CASES THAT HAVE TO LOOK OFF NURSE. AS THEY- NEED IT. WE'RE NOT. CAN YOU TO CURE UNITS ARE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO COME IN WITH COLBY IT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A FIRST DOWN A RED AND WE THE HAS NOT. ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN A ABOUT AS FAR A SURE A REGISTERED NURSES BEING AVAILABLE SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE DIGITAL TESTIMONY SENATOR DODD. YEAH YOU KNOW I THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- IS GOT MY ATTENTION I HAD SOME. REAL CONCERNS ABOUT A STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNED ABOUT IT. BUT YOU'LL HAVE TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE IN BY. YOUR IN MY DISTRICT AND I GET A NUMBER OF CALLS- THROUGHOUT THE YEAR FROM THE YEAH THAT. THEY THE HEAD OF THE- THE BASE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD SAY HEY WE'RE YOUR WORK OR BRING IT ALL THIS TOP MILITARY FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEIR WIVES ARE. FOR EXAMPLE OR HUSBANDS WOULD REGARD AS WELL YEAH. WITH REGARD TO YEAH WITH WHOEVER'S IN IN THE SERVICE. SAY HEY THEY DON'T PASS. YEAH THEY DON'T PASS BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA TEST IT OUT WELL I HEAR YOU AND I HEAR PEOPLE SAY WERE THE BEST IN THE WORLD DEAL WE ALWAYS THINK WE'RE THE BEST THE WORLD IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S JUST. KIND OF WHO WE ARE I'M NOT SURE THAT'S REAL I'M NOT SURE THAT IN A TOTAL. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED SOME. AB THIRD PARTY VERIFICATION OF THESE STANDARDS AND WHY THEY'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN. OTHER STATES WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO PRACTICE. IT SO I'D- MY PROBLEM OF THE GIVE YOU A COURTESY VOTE TODAY- ON THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE THE DIALOG CONTINUE AND I WANT TO TALK TO- A CNA AND OTHERS WHO OPPOSE THIS BUT I LOOK AT THE LONG LIST OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND IT STARTS MAKE ME WONDER. YEAH WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE WE PROTECTING THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR ARE WE ADVANCING POLICY TO- CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT'S NEEDED BUT I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT- YOU KNOW IN THE VOTE. YEAH ON THE SENATE FLOOR TO CHANGE MY MIND ON THIS BASED ON FURTHER CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU SENATOR DODD ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CENTER LEYVA. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. I THINK THIS IS THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES HERE- GOOD BAD INDIFFERENT. WHEN THIS BE BETTER TAKEN UP UNDER SUNSET REVIEW SO WE COULD HAVE A FULL DEBATE. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE SUNSET REVIEW IS. THIS THAT WOULD BE THE BETTER TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS CENTER LEYVA ALL THE NOTES AND I'LL ASK MY STAFF TO CORRECTLY THAT WE THE SUNSET REVIEW FOR THAT BOARD IS UP AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE NEXT YEAR. BY HERE TO COLLEGE AND FROM MY STAFF'S SO THAT'S A DIRECT ANSWER YOUR- COURSE. ALL RIGHT IF THERE'S NO FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS A LITTLE IT CENTER MORE LOCK. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE IN THAT I HAVE SOME- SOME CLOSING COMMENTS AS WELL CENTER MORE LIFE. THIS FEATURE- THANKS FOR THE DISCUSSION- AS I STATED EARLIER WITH THE CONSULTANTS. AT PLANETARY SIDE I THINK THERE ARE A FEW AREAS WHERE THEY'RE NOT ACCURATE OR- THERE. IS SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED. REBEKAH FIGHTS TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS- I WILL SAY THAT. THIS TO POINT OUT A COUPLE- ONE OR JUST ONE THE BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR THE COMPACT ARE DONE BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION THE FBI SO. I WE WERE WORK WITH DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HERE. PRETTY HEIST FOR. A WHO IS APPROVED TO BE A NURSE- IN THIRTY FOUR STATES AND CALIFORNIA. THIS TO THE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING ENOUGH NURSES. THERE WAS TWO FOLD ONE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PRODUCING ENOUGH WAS THE STATEMENT BY MS HARRIS SO IF THAT'S ACCURATE THEN WE HAVE NURSES THAT COULD HELP THE OTHER THIRTY FOUR STATES GIVES THEM. AN UP TO BE EMPLOYED. IT ALSO GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HEALTH WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL PROVIDES THE AUTHORITY TO HELP THOSE I UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WERE. YOU KNOW WE'RE HAVING ISSUES WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOSPITALS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CLINICS. SO THE OTHER POINT WAS THAT. MANY NURSES HAVE BEEN LAID OFF DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE PUT AFTER HOSPITALS IN OUR MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS JUST TO FOCUS ON ONE THING WE'VE WE'VE MADE. SO MANY HOSPITALS IN FACT JUST FOCUSED ON PAVILION NOTHING ELSE NOTHING OPTIONAL NO OPTIONAL SURGERIES NOTHING ELSE IS SOLD WE WE'VE WE'VE KIND OF BEEN DECIMATING A- A PROFESSION THAT WE NEED TO PUT THAT BACK TOGETHER BUT THAT'S A DISCUSSION FOR ANOTHER TIME. MISTER CHAIR THE NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT HAS BEEN FUNCTIONING FOR TWENTY YEARS. NEW JERSEY ADJUST TO PROVE THEIR LEGISLATION LAST YEAR AND PROBABLY IN THE NICK OF TIME BECAUSE IT HELPS. BRING A LOT OF NURSES TO NEW JERSEY TO A DEAL WITH THE COKE AT NINETEEN. A PANDEMIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED THE CONSULTANTS THOROUGH ANALYSIS CAN BE RESOLVED I BELIEVE THROUGH THE AWARENESS. THAT THIS OPPORTUNITY IS OPTIONAL OR WITH MINOR CORRECTIVE. ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS OR LEGISLATION IN THE NEXT SESSION THESE ARE NOT DIFFICULT ISSUES. SB TEN FIFTY THREE HAS AN IMPRESSIVE LIST OF SUPPORTERS. FROM THE US SECRETARY OF THE ARMY. THE SOME TWENTY TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL REGISTERED NURSES AND JUST RECENTLY NOT ON YOUR LIST THE RED CROSS. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF CALIFORNIA MOVES IN THIS DIRECTION IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN. WITH COVERT NINETEEN. THERE COULDN'T BE A STRONGER MOTIVATOR CONSEQUENTLY I ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB TEN FIFTY THREE. THANK YOU I THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LOCK- I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO YOU FIRST FOR STIMULATING A VERY IMPORTANT AND- CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION TODAY. ABOUT THIS A ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I AND I KNOW THAT THE MOTIVATION THAT YOU HAVE IS A IT IS A AND AN ADMIRABLE ONE. TWO WILL IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY ACCESSIBILITY OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OF THOSE WHO PRACTICE. OF BOTH FOR CONSUMERS AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN IT. AND I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE AYE AYE NOTE SENATOR DODD SET. REMARKS ABOUT TRYING TO- DIG DOWN DEEPER ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST. CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL BARRIER BUT ONE THAT IS CONSTRUCTIVE THE THAT MEETS CALIFORNIA STANDARDS BUT ALSO IS IT KEEPS IN MIND- THE DESIRE TO. HELP THOSE WHO PRACTICE IN THAT FIELD IN THOSE WHO CONSUME IT- TO MAKE OUR WORLD A BETTER PLACE. CERTAINLY THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE REYES AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED OVER MANY YEARS ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES. FOR A NURSE WHO HAS PRACTICED IN ANOTHER STATE TO COME HERE AND PRACTICE- IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A BEARS REVIEW AND- I WILL NOTE THAT WE HAVE A REVIEW IN MIND- TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING IS UP FOR SUNSET REVIEW. FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR IT MEANS THAT IF. IF THAT REVIEW WAS NOT COMPLETED- ON TIME- THAT BOARD TO GO OUT OF EXISTENCE SO THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE. TO AFTER THIRTY MINUTES OF THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING- THE TIME IT TAKES THEM TO REVIEW APPLICANTS. WHO WANT TO PRACTICE WHETHER THAT'S REASONABLE OR NOT TO EXAMINE THE ISSUES OF FRAUD- THAT THAT- THE DAY ARE CHARGE WITH THE AND FORCE IT IS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT GO INTO THAT REVIEW. AND I THINK THAT THIS DEBATE HERE TODAY IS THE KIND OF CONVERSATION WE SHOULD HAVE IT REVIEW. TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT- WE ARE CREATING ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS- THAT LIMIT THE ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE THAT WE ALL WANT. OUR STATE AND SO FOR ME. WITH YOUR LEGISLATION. I WOULD BE. PUTTING IN A DEPOSIT BUTTON ON IT THE TODAY AND GIVEN US THE CHANCE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION OF THE DIALOGUE AND ENGAGEMENT THAT WE WILL DO THROUGH OUR SUNSET REVIEW NEXT YEAR. AND SO ON FOR ME TODAY IT SAID NOT YET- AVAILABLE. AND NOT A NO VOTE BUT NOT YET A LITTLE BIT AND- I WANT TO GET EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR. YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS CONVERSATION- AND I'M SURE IT WILL CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY MOTION TO BE MADE. SENATOR CHECK.

IT WOULD ENTER CALIFORNIA INTO THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST COMPACT THIS WILL PROVIDE LICENSING RECIPROCITY FOR PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND PHYSICAL THERAPIST ASSISTANTS AND A CONTACT NETWORK THAT CURRENTLY INCLUDES TWENTY SIX OTHER STATES. MISTER CHAIR OF BASED ON OUR LAST DISCUSSION ON SB TEN FIFTY THREE I WILL ABBREVIATE MY REMARKS- FOR SB TEN FIFTY FOUR AS THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR. UP MAY I PLEASE REQUEST THAT MY TWO WITNESSES HAVE A CHANCE TO. TESTIFY AND MAKE THEIR PRESENTATIONS IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER A LICENSING COMPACT IN THIS INSTANCE. IN ORDER TO HAVE SACRAMENTO PUT ITS TOES IN THE WATER. SO TO SPEAK AND OBTAIN EXPERIENCE FROM INVOLVEMENT IN MISS NETWORK HOPEFULLY. IT WILL PROVIDE A COMFORT LEVEL FOR PURSUING SIMILAR RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FUTURE.

REACH CHOICE PORTABILITY AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER FOR MILITARY SPOUSES. AND COMBINED WITH TELEHEALTH WE BELIEVE THIS CAN BE ESPECIALLY POWERFUL TOOL. FOR MEETING THE DEMANDS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS I WOULD NOTE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW CHANGE THAT MEDICARE LAW TO ALLOW HELLO HOW ARE YOU FIRST FOR TELEHEALTH. ACROSS STATE LINES SO THIS MAY IN FACT BE A GREAT MODEL TO LOOK AT IS CENTER BOX ITSELF- TEN FIFTY FOUR PRESERVES. OUR STATE LICENSING SYSTEM IN ACTUALLY ENHANCES PUBLIC PROTECTION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER MORE LOCKED. LIKE TO INVITE UP BY SENATOR THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB. ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE. THERE MCGUIRE WELCOME. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. EIGHT AT THE OPPORTUNITY BETTER PRESENTED HOPE ALL HAD A GOOD WEEKEND- YES IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO I INTRODUCED TO SB ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE TO THE COMMITTEE. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SAID THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IN AFTER LOSING EVERYTHING SURVIVORS BEGIN THE CHALLENGING TASK OF REBUILDING THEIR HOMES AND OF COURSE THEIR LIVES THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES HAVE BEEN SOME THE LARGEST DISASTER REBUILDING EFFORTS IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. LOSING A HOME DRAMATIC ENOUGH BUT ANY NOT PUTTING ON EXPERIENCE CONTRACTOR OR WORSE A CONTRACTOR WHO IN IN A WHO INTENTIONALLY TAKES A JOB KNOWING THAT THEY CAN'T FINISH IT HAS MADE THE REBUILDING PROCESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE HEALING PROCESS INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC. CURRENTLY THERE IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH FOR ALL CONTRACTORS DAVY A GENERAL CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE THIS ALLOWS CONTRACTORS TO TAKE ON JOBS FROM BOTTLING. TO I SCRIPT LITTLE ITALY LATE SINCE THIS IS A LICENSE TRACK WHO NORMALLY DO SOME READ PROJECTS WE KITCHEN IN BATHROOMS FOR EXAMPLE TO MEET THE TAKE ON LARGER JOB THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF DOING LIKE READ POEM DESPITE OR DOING A FULL WE BEFORE WE SAW THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SECOND ABLE TO BE. TO A SENATOR DOT ON THIS IS WE WORK VERY CLOSE ON IN. WE SAW THIS AND OVER IN PART IN CENTER. CON WITH NO PREVIOUS. OF THE INTO HOME TAKE ON A READ PROJECT COPY PARK IS A WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD FOR ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO HOMES WERE WIPED OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH BY THE TUBS FIRE. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THE MAJORITY OF CONTRACTORS WHO BEEN IN THE REBUILD FROM THE TUBS FIRE IN ALL OF THE OTHER NORTE FIRES HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING. BUT THERE ARE FEW CONTRACTORS REPRESENTING SEVERAL DOZEN INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS THAT CHARGE FIRE VICTIMS AND FULL PRICE TO REBUILD ST INCLUDED SHODDY WORK. AND COUNTLESS MISTAKES SOME JOBS THEY WERE EVEN COMPLETED SOME JOBS WEREN'T STARTED THESE CONTRACTORS SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE BUSINESS A REBUILDS THEY LACK. A SERIES IN. FOR THE JOB. SURVIVOR TWO WENT TO THE DRAMATIC A- OF LIVING FOR A WHILE. THEY HAD A DEAL WITH THEIR DAY KANT. WHO WERE IMPROPERLY FREE WALL. INSTALLING FRAME. IN PUTTING WINDOWS IN. SB ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE LOOKS THE STATE ONE FITS ALL CONTRACTORS LICENSING SCHEME. RATHER THAN ALL CONTRACTORS HAVING A GENERAL CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE TO LICENSES WOULD BE USHERED IN. ONE THAT WOULD BE FOCUS ON REMODELS THIS WOULD BE NEW. AND THE OTHER FOCUS ON HOME CONSTRUCTION THIS IS THE CURRENT SITUATION. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE TRANSPARENCY THAT CONSUMERS JUST REALLY NEED ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF DISASTER. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXTEND HOME IMPROVEMENT LAW PROTECTIONS THE FULL HOME RECONSTRUCTION AFTER DISASTERS. THERE'S A LOOPHOLE CURRENTLY THE LAW PROVIDES CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ON HOME REMODELS AND REPAIRS PROTECTIONS. AS WELL SUCH AS REQUIRING WORK TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE FULL PAYMENT CAN BE DEMANDED. HOWEVER THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHILE THEY DO NOT INCLUDE HOME RECONSTRUCTION. REBUILDS RESTORATION FOR STRUCTURES LOST TO NATURAL DISASTER. THE BILL WOULD EXPAND TO THESE COMMONSENSE PROTECTIONS ADDITIONALLY ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE WILL CLOSE ANOTHER LOOPHOLE IN OUR CRIMINAL LAWS WHICH CURRENTLY DO NOT INCLUDE HOME REBUILDS. IN THE DEFINITION OF HOME IMPROVEMENT I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT IT'S SIMPLY A LOOPHOLE. CURRENTLY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE HESITANT TO PROSECUTE UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FIRE SURVIVORS BECAUSE THE LAWS ARE CLEAR IF THOSE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. ALSO APPLIED TO REBUILD IN RESTORATIONS. I THE MISTER CHAIRMAN AGAIN I'M TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL SIR IN YOUR CREDIT STAFF THIS LED TO. IS SUPPORTED BY THE CON STATE. BOARD I WANT TO TAKE A SAFE YOU. FOR THE TO THE BOY FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS.

SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN IT WOULD PROMOTE. A COLLABORATIVE MODEL OF PATIENT CARE. FOR CERTIFIED- CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES AND PHYSICIANS. MY AIM IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE FOR CHILDBIRTH BY REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT. THAT A CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIFE SECURE THE PERMISSION OF A PHYSICIAN IN ORDER TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS REQUIREMENT DOES NOT PROMOTE TEAM BASED CARE HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE SAFETY OR QUALITY OF CARE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN IN RESULTS- IN REDUCED ACCESS TO BIRTHING WOMEN. SUPERVISION DOESN'T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE IT'S NOT TO FIGHT A CALIFORNIA STATUTE THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE POSITION TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT EXAMINE THE PATIENT SIDE TO REVIEW ANY CHARTS OR OVERSEE PATIENT CARE. IN ANY WAY. IN FACT A RECENT L. EIGHT REPORT LA- REPORT FOUND THE CALIFORNIA SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS FOR NURSE MIDWIVES IS UNLIKELY TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND QUALITY FOR LOW RISK PREGNANCIES AND BIRTHS THEIR WORK THAT ARE WITH IN THE C. N. M. SCOPE. THIS LAW HAS RESULTED IN CONCENTRATING NURSE MIDWIVES IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WERE PHYSICIANS PRACTICE. PHYSICALLY PRACTICE REDUCING ACCESS PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COUNTIES WHICH HAVE BECOME MATERNITY DESERT'S IT IS MARGINALIZED MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THERE NINE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THE DO NOT HAVE AN OBGYN. MODOC TRINITY GLAND COLUSA SIERRA YUBA MONNOW ALPINE IN MARIPOSA. IN ADDITION TO THESE MATERNITY DESERT'S IN NOT WITHSTANDING CALIFORNIA HAVING MADE GREAT STRIDES IN REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY. RACIAL DISPARITIES IN OUTCOMES PERSIST BLACK IN INDIGENOUS WOMEN REMAIN THREE TO FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM PREGNANCY RELATED CAUSES. THAN WHITE WOMEN. THERE'S A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN RACE AND ACCESS TO MATERNITY CARE NATIONWIDE. THIS IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM REQUIRING MULTIPLE INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO TURN THE TIDE. IMPROVING ACCESS TO NURSE MIDWIFERY CARE HAS BEEN NAMED BY LEADING ORGANIZATIONS. SUCH AS THE MARCH OF DIMES THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THESE INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES IN ADDRESSING THESE RACIAL DISPARITIES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ANOTHER BENEFIT OF NURSE MIDWIFERY. IS CARE IS LOWER COST A STUDY SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA. HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION SHOWS THAT INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF PREGNANCIES WITH MIDWIFE LED CARE FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL OF ABOUT 9% 220% OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. COULD RESULT IN A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR IN COST SAVINGS IN THIRTY THOUSAND FEWER PRETERM BIRTHS. LASTLY I WISH TO POINT OUT THE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES IN THE NATION. PLEASE REPEAT THAT ONE OF FOUR STATES IN THE NATION THAT STILL REQUIRES PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION IN ORDER FOR NURSE MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES AMENDMENTS THAT I AM OFFERING AND ACCEPTING. THESE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY INTENT LANGUAGE AND ADDRESS THE MAKE UP OF NURSE MIDWIFERY ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING REGARDING PRACTICE PROTOCOLS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE CNN'S. THERE ARE STILL A FEW OUTSTANDING ISSUES WE ARE WORKING ON WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THE SAYS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. IT ALSO IS ALSO RAISES POLICY QUESTIONS THAT WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS IN STATUTE. AND I COMMIT TO ADDRESSING THESE AS WELL.

UNDER THE SAME CORPORATE BAR THAT- THE OBGYN SO THAT THEY WOULD BE COLLABORATING WITH- TODAY WOULD BE IN THAT SAME INDEPENDENT SITUATION- SO I JUST WONDER WHETHER YOU'D BE WILLING TO COMMIT TO. SOMETHING THAT IN YOUR BILL TO UNDERSTAND IN OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION THAT'S NOT FROM THE PART OF THE BILL. YES WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SENATOR- I THINK THAT'S A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. THESE WERE NOT INCREASING THEIR SCOPE. OF PRACTICE TODAY THEY PRACTICE MIDWIFERY WHICH IS- BY- STUDY- BUT- THE MOST AFFORDABLE CARE- YOU KNOW IN IN IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. IT ALSO DEFIES. THE TEAM BASED. APPROACH WITH- DOCTORS THAT THEY THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THEM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE COMMITTEE- WE'VE GOT HER FOR COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS WE'VE NOT HEARD ABOUT THIS FROM THE- DID THE CM- CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- YOU THE- ALSO WE PASSED AB FIVE SO WE PUT THESE NURSES MIDWIVES. HERE REAL PRECARIOUS POSITION BECAUSE WITH AB FIVE THEY CANNOT BE HIRED. AS A CONSULTANT A CHIROPRACTOR'S HOSPITALS THEY'RE PREVENTED AND THEN HERE WITH CORPORATE BAR THEY CAN'T BE EMPLOYED BY THE- THINK WE FOR THOSE TWO REASONS. I WOULD NOT CONSIDER I WOULD CONSIDER THAT A HOSTILE AMENDMENT OKAY WELL I UNFORTUNATELY- PERSONAL IT'S NOT HOSTILE WELL- A DIED I BEG TO DIFFER I MEAN TO SAY YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAVE. YOUR OWN OPINION ABOUT I THINK THAT- BECAUSE WE ARE I MEAN THE ESSENCE OF THE BILL WHICH I DO SUPPORT IS THAT WOULD GIVE NURSE MIDWIVES. AND INTERPRET INDEPENDENT PRACTICE RATE I MEAN. CENTERS I THINK THAT YOU POINTED OUT THAT- YOU KNOW TO KEEP THEY CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE IT I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE IT. THAT'S I BELIEVE IS THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE WANT TO SHARE THAT IN THERE INDEPENDENCE AND AGAIN IT'S THAT ACTUALLY DOESN'T. ARTICLE PROVIDE DOESN'T PREVENT AND A AN A PLAYMATE RELATIONSHIP. OTHER PEOPLE AND THEIR SAME SHE ALSO TELL UNDER- MIDWIFE'S COULD HAVE OTHER PERSON IN. REPORT EYE WORK THE OTHER PERFECT WELL SELF.

HEALTH CALIFORNIAN AUTHORIZED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CATS AND DOGS STATE RIGHT IN A SINGLE YEAR. THIS BILL WILL TO LIMITATIONS IN CURRENT LAWTHAT PREVENTS MOST SHELTERS FROM GIVING PROPER TREATMENT.

AT ME INSTEAD OF AN ANIMAL KERR TO THE SHIP FLEET. ON STAY. LEGAL AND TO USE THE NIGHT I AM. BUT NOT EMPOWER TO GIVE IT A FLEA PILL. THIS BILL WILL EQUALIZE THE ABILITY FOR ANIMAL SHELTER CARE TAKERS TO PROVIDE FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ADD. WHAT DO YOU. ARE OUT UNDER CURRENT LAW TO BE FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR- OWN PETS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ALLOW PROPERLY TRAINED OFFICERS EMPLOYEES AND VOLUNTEERS OF AN ANIMAL SHELTER THE AUTHORITY TO ADMINISTER OVER THE COUNTER OR PRESCRIPTION VACCINATIONS. TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE WITHOUT PRESENCE OF A VETERINARIAN. THE PROPERLY TRAIN SHELTER STAFF WILL ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PERFORM NECESSARY BASIC FIRST AID WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF A VETERINARIAN WHEN THEY HAVE A WRITTEN TREATMENT PLAN FROM THE VETERINARIAN AND A WOUND CARE PROTOCOL. IN PLACE TO TRACK THE ARE PROVIDED. THIS ALL SO EXACT APART FROM WHITES WHEN ENGAGE IN THE SPACE ACTS OF VETERINARY CARE THE SHELTERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAIN RECORDS OF THE CARE. DURING THE LAST RECESSION PEOPLE WHO LIVE HOMES WERE ABANDONED ABANDONING THEIR ANIMALS AT ALARMING RATES. I'M AFRAID HISTORY WILL BE REPEATING ITSELF GIVEN THE ESCALATING NUMBER OF EMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN AND THAT WITHOUT THIS BILL EUTHANASIA.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS CHRISTINA TO CARL FOR THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE ASSOCIATION CURRENTLY HAS AN OPPOSED POSITION ON THE MEASURE. CDMA CAR WAS IN THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WORKED WITH THE BMB FOR OVER FOUR YEARS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RICH PACKAGE THAT THIS BILL. TO IMPROVE. THE VMAS CONCERNED THAT LAYS SHELTER STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS WOULD BE PERFORMING VETERINARY MEDICINE. WITHOUT VETERINARIAN OVERSIGHT IN APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY OF CALIFORNIA SHELTERS. CDMA FEEL THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR SHELTERS TO HAVE A CONTINUOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH A VETERINARIAN IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF SHELTER PETS. SENATOR GALGIANI AND THE SPONSORS HOSTED A LENGTHY CALL WITH CDMA LAST WEEK AND FOLLOWING THAT CALL A LIST TO FILL THE ON YOUR STAFF AND YOU MISTER CHAIR WERE ALL INSTRUMENTAL IN THE CURRENT. ALL OF US TO WORK TOGETHER. BUT IT. H. LIKE GO ALONG IN ADDRESSING SOME OF CB A MAYES CONCERNS THEY APPEAR TO TIGHTEN UP THE BILL NARROW ITS FOCUS AND CLARIFY SEVERAL ISSUES SUCH AS THE DRUGS TO BE ADMINISTERED. THAT WERE PROBLEMATIC AREAS FOR CDMA AND WHAT WE CAN'T COMMIT TO READ MOVING OUR OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OUR BOARD MUST REVIEW THE LANGUAGE AND TAKE FORMAL ACTION WE DO A SHEET. OF COMMITTEE AND WE'RE GALGIANI DURING A VERY TIGHT TIME FRAME IN THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR IS THERE ANYONE ELSE ON THE PHONE LINE WHICH IS TESTIFY. IT'S TIME.

A MOTION IT WAS FROM A FULL THIRD. OF FACILITY FOSTER OF FAMILY THAT- HANDLES THAT AND IN A LOT OF THE CONCERN AND THE REASON THAT THE FOSTER CARE IS SO IMPORTANT. IS BECAUSE OF THE FEAR. OF THESE ANIMALS GOING TO THE SHELTERS AND THE LACK OF. OF VETERINARY SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED IN THAT THE COST TO THE- TO THE TO THE SHELTERS IN THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACED BY THE SHELTERS AND THE FEAR THAT THE ANIMALS COMING. THE SHELTER AFTER THE OPTION HAVE. PROBLEMS THAT ARE TAKE. RELIGIOUS SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL APPRECIATE THE WORK IS BEING DONE FOR YOU. THE A COMMUNITY DOESN'T IS A- GREEN WITH YOU AND BEEN AND THAT THE AREA THE AMENDMENTS TO YOU'VE TAKEN GOAL OF WAY ALL SOME OF THE ISSUES AND PROBLEMS WITH THANK UP HAVE TO SUPPORT EVERY MOVE IT'S TIME THANK YOU FOR TELL SENATOR PAT. BUT I WANT THANK SERGEI NINETY FOR HER WORK ON THE BILL ACTION QUESTION TO THE VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CDMA. THEORISTS ON THE LINE. THE OPERATOR CAN YOU OPEN THE LINE FOR THE THIS THE LAST SPEAKER PLEASE. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION STILL ON THE LINE PLEASE. OPERATOR POS SYSTEMS SO INDICATE SO IN CASE THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH. OPERATOR YES CAN YOU AND ASK IF THE PERSON- WHO SPOKE PREVIOUSLY IS STILL AVAILABLE ON THE LINE FROM THE VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IF THEY'D LIKE TO- BE AVAILABLE FOR A QUESTION PLEASE. ABSOLUTELY LATELY TO SIXTY WOULD YOU PLEASE PRESS SO ONE ZERO ONE ZERO AGAIN. ONE ZERO AND WE'LL GO TO LINE TWO SIXTY PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU. OKAY WELL THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. THINK IT'S GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL- BUILD I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL BASICALLY FOCUSES ON THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE THAT ACTUALLY NORMALLY A PET OWNER WOULD BE ABLE TO DO ON THEIR OWN. BUT BECAUSE THE ANIMALS IN A SHELTER AND THE SHELTER STAFF ARE NOT TECHNICALLY OWNERS THAT DAY COULD PERFORM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TECHNICALLY THE UPPERS BUT YET IN NORMAL AND I GUESS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND OWNER WITHOUT SUPERVISION VETERINARIAN WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SIDE EVEN SO. CLEAR BY FROM YOUR FOR THE- SO THERE TO SITUATE FROM YOUR- CERTAIN AGREE WITH YOU THE- THAT WE SHOULD TRY HAVE A VERY. YOU KNOW RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE SHELTERS AND THEN MAYBE THE SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT- YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY THAT MAY THE SHELTERS TO HAVE CHALLENGES THAT FINING VETS WHO ARE WILLING TO. PLAY THAT ROLE AND DAY ON THE MAYBE LIABILITY ISSUES ARE THINGS THAT PREVENT VETERINARIANS FROM DOING THAT. BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN ALSO ADDRESS- WHAT'S BEING DONE TO ENSURE THAT SHELTERS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO VETERINARIANS- IN THAT ROLE BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE FIRST QUESTION I ASKED THAT IN RELATION TO THE TYPES OF THINGS. THAT SHELTERS TREATMENTS CHECK. SHELTER STAFF WOULD BE ABLE TO. TODAY IN A SHELTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS CHRISTINA TO CARL CAN YOU HEAR ME. WE CAN'T THANK YOU CRISTINA GO AHEAD. EXCELLENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION DOCTOR PAN REALLY APPRECIATE IT I THINK THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION ABOUTTHE- BROAD APPLICATION OF THE BILL. I THINK THE NON PRESCRIPTION ELEMENT WILL BE- IF WE TIGHTEN THAT UP THAT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TO CDMA. YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN THOUGH DOCTOR PAN- I THINK WHERE- THE CDMA WOULD BE. MORE COMFORTABLE IS IF THERE WAS SOME APPROPRIATE TRAINING FOR SHELTER STAFF I KNOW THE SPONSORS ARE WORKING ON THAT COMPONENT I KNOW THAT THE- BEING ON THAT COMPONENT. A WE'RE CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW AS A SPECIES SUCH AS BORDER COLLIES COULD DIE IF GIVEN- IVERMECTIN AND SO WE JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL- THAT PROPER TRAINING AND PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE. ON YOUR QUESTION WITH THE CHALLENGES AND THE VETERINARIANS- PERFORMING THIS ROLE. ALSO A VERY GOOD QUESTION A CDMA HAS BEEN WORKING WITH CAUGHT WHAT TO TRY TO IDENTIFY. SOME OPPORTUNITIES. YOU KNOW WHERE ARE THE FAILURES IN TRYING TO RECRUIT AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY CAN BE HELPFUL.
