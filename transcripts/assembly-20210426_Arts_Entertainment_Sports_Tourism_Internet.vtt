REGULATE SPEECH IT'S A CONSUMER

01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:45.013

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:01.463
LAW ACCEPTS THIS EVERYDAY

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.465

PROTECTS AGAINST FRAUD

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:07.903
EXPLOITATION AND OTHER INJURIES.

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.037
AB THIRTY FIVE IS LIKE A

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:11.106
REQUIREMENT THAT ONE SELLING A

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:20.448
ONE SELLING SOFTWARE COULD BE

REQUIRED TO PAY FOR PURCHASERS

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:26.922
WARRANTY. IN DEALING WITH

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:27.822
EXPRESSION PROTECTED BY THE

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.057
FIRST AMENDMEN THERE'S A

01:20:29.124 --> 01:20:30.792
REQUIREMENT THAT THE LAW TO BE

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:33.028
MORE PRECISE THAN WHAT IS

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:33.628
EXPECTED FROM ONE OF THE BILL

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:36.498
LEGISLATION. BUT THIS WILL HI

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:39.000
IS QUITE DETAILED. ESPECIALLY

01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:40.735
AFTER THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENT.

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:42.404

TOUCH UPON THE TIME PLACE AND

MANNER OF EXPRESSION. THE FIRST

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:52.047
AMENDMENT DOES NOT PREVENT

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:53.481
SHOULD CIVIL PROTECTION

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:55.283
DISCLOSURES OF HESE TIGHTS.

DAY. THANK YOU- I DO JUST HAVE

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.168
A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS IN TERMS

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:22.504
OF CLARIFICATION FOR WHAT THE

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:24.939
BILL ACTUALLY DOES AND WHO. AND

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:28.076
HOW IT IS APPLIED I'M SOUL

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:31.212
WOULD THIS JUST REQUIRE. A

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:34.883
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. TWO ONE

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:37.319
SEND THAT MSSAGE TO ITS USERS

01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:38.820
THOUGHT THEY HAVE A POLICY IN

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:41.656
PLACE AND OR WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:45.060
ATTACHED TO EVERY ARTICLE AND

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:47.495
HOW ARE THEY DOES THE LANGUAGE

01:22:47.562 --> 01:22:49.464
DECIPHER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:51.700
AN ARTICLE AND A POST FOR

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:53.034
INSTANCE IF SOMEBODY WERE TO

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:54.636
POST AN ARTICLE- AND LINK THE

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:56.438
ARTICLE YOU CAN CLICK ON THAT.

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:58.406
LINK AND IT GOES TO WHATEVER

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.542
ARTICLE FROM WHATEVER MEDIA

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:04.212
DOES AND MEDIA MEDIUM- BUT IF

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:05.547
SOMEBODY WERE TO CUT AND PASTE

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:08.049
AN ARTICLE ON TO THEIR OWN POST

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:09.718
THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT SO

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:10.885
WITHOUT TAKING INTO

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:12.087
CONSIDERATION CAN YOU ADD SOME

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:13.888
CLARIFICATION FOR ME SURE

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:15.690
THANKS WE QUESTIONED THE LAW

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:17.892
WILL REQUIRE THE SOCIAL MEDIA

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:21.029
PLATFORM ITSELF TO POSE. SOME

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:23.898
KIND OF A NOTICE TO THE USER OF

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:26.935
THAT PLATFORM SO- IF YOU SAY

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:29.104
THAT IS A ONE TIME- A SITUATION

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:30.638
THAT IS THE CASE BECAUSE IT HAS

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:32.941
TO BE OF NOTICEABLE IT HAS TO

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:35.577
BE DISPLAYED ARE VISIBLE WAY TO

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:38.613
THE USER SO IT COULD BE- THAT'S

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.781
A ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.250
WEBSITE THE END UP YOU KNOW

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:43.151
DOESN'T HELP YOU KNOW THE

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.452
ARTICLE WAS RECEIVED OUR

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:46.955
ARTICLES THAT. WOULD BE LINKED

01:23:47.021 --> 01:23:48.690
UP FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD THERE

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:49.858
IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THOSE

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:51.760
ARTICLES HAVE TO BE- YOU KNOW

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:52.761
GIVEN NOTICE AT THE

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:54.396
REQUIREMENTS ON THE SOCIAL

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:56.264
MEDIA PLATFORM ITSELF THAT'S A

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:57.932
TWITTER OR OTHERWISE HAVE A

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:59.434
FACEBOOK YOU KNOW THEY USUALLY

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.736
HAVE A PIZZA OR COME YOU KNOW

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:03.772
THE OF THE FIRST PAGE OF THE

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:09.010
COVER PAGE. SO THERE HAS TO BE

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:10.779
POST THERE ONCE. THE YOU FOR.

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:13.448
AND I THINK THIS ALSO INCORRECT

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:15.617
REFORM WRONG BUT IT ALSO BUILDS

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.252
ON WHAT IS ALREADY BEING

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:21.389
ESTABLISHED- IN THE LAST- IF

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.958
YOU WANT TO SAY YEAR OR LONGER

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:26.494
WHERE I KNOW THAT ON SOME OF

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:28.730
SOCIAL MEDIA STORIES AND SO

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:30.965
FORTH SOMETHING MAY COME OUT

01:24:31.032 --> 01:24:32.267
AND THEN YOU CLICK IT IT SAYS

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:33.601
THE CONTENTS NO LONGER

01:24:33.668 --> 01:24:35.003
AVAILABLE BECAUSE EITHER

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:36.638
THEY'VE ALREADY PUT OUT THAT

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:38.406
IT'S FALL SO SOME OF THE

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.008
PLATFORMS ARE ALREADY STARTING

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.709
TO DO THIS EVEN WITHOUT THIS SO

01:24:41.776 --> 01:24:43.244
THIS JUST FOLLOWS THAT IS THAT

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:44.512
CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT I

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.247
THINK. MANY OF THE MAJOR-

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:47.582
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.417
ALREADY DOING IT SOME DO MORE

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:51.886

THE BUTTON SAYING THEY DO WHAT

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:57.926
THEY DO NOT HAVE SUCH A POLICY

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:59.427
SO BUT THAT THERE ARE

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:01.362
APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED OF

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:03.198
THESE PLATFORMS OUT THERE AND

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:04.966
ONLY CERTAIN MAJOR ONES ARE

DOING TO US SO WE ARE ASKING

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.605
THAT ALL PLATFORMS TO THE SAME.

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:11.673
AND AGAIN WE ALSO HAVE TO BE

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.975
DILIGENT OURSELVES TO DO YOUR

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:17.545

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:29.057
WHENEVER IN ACTUAL

01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:31.459
IMPLEMENTATION LIKE YOU ARE

IS SELF FOR OUR TO- DISCLOSER

THERE ARE POLICY. ORGANIZERS

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:55.383
OUR MY OWN ALICE'S SYSTEM

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:58.219
MECHANISM TO ADDRESS SPREAD ALL

01:25:58.286 --> 01:26:03.157
WILL. MISS IN FORMATION- EVEN

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:10.865
THOUGH. BY REQUIRING ALL DAHLE-

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:14.569
PLATFORM SO TO HAVE TO DISCLOSE

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:19.641
AVAIL POLICY. ONCE THE-

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:27.448
DISCLOSE. DOES THAT. ALLOW THEM

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.984
TO THIS COMMITTEE ON DEAL OWN

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.886
DEFINITION WHAT THE

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:35.390
MISINFORMATION OR BE HOW CAN

01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:37.792
YOU DEFINE WHAT I CAN DEFINE

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:41.029
THEM WHAT IS A MISINFORMATION

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:44.699
SO IN OTHER WORDS SO THEY CAN

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:46.868
CHANGE THEIR MIND ANYTIME. THE

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:49.737
AGENCY I TREAT THE ASSESSORS

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:51.906
FOR MISINFORMATION. YOU

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:55.510
MENTIONED- NAY TURN OF IRIS.

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:58.179
HALL HALL HALL CAN YOU'LL RULED

01:26:58.246 --> 01:26:58.580
IT THAT DOES SOME

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:01.382
MISINFORMATION IN ALL SAW THAT

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:03.318
WORRIES ME I THINK THERE IS A

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:05.086
VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION WE

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:07.255
WANT TO MAKE OF THE BILL ONLY

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:09.457
REQUIRES THE PLATFORMS TO SEE

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:10.858
WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SUCH A

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:12.760
POLICY IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:14.762
REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF THE

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:17.398
POLICY- SILVA SO THERE IS IT'S

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:19.100
A MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:21.302
TWO. BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:23.638
NOT ASKING THESE PLATFORMS TO

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:25.206
TELL US WHAT THE POLICIES FAR

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:27.275
WE JUST ASKING THEM WHETHER OR

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:28.876
NOT THEY HAVE SUCH A POLICY.

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:31.112
AND AS FAR AS THE DEFINITION

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:33.247
ITSELF IT'S THE IT'S LISTED IN

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:35.316
IN THE LAW ITSELF HOW YOU KNOW

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:37.218
HOW WE DEFINE A MISINFORMATION

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:38.720
IT PASSED TO MEET ONE OF THE

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:40.288
ACT ACTUALLY HAS TO MEET THE

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:41.589
THREE CRITERIA THAT THAT'S

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:44.525
LISTED IN THE LAW- I MEAN JUST

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:46.461
READ HIM OFF LAW SO THEY HAVE

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:48.062
TO ADDRESS THE SPREAD OF

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:49.664
MISINFORMATION THAT THAT

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.099
CONTRIBUTES TO THE RISK OF

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:53.134
IMMINENT VIOLENCE. OR PHYSICAL

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:55.637
HARM OR TO REDUCING THE SPREAD

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:57.705
OF HARMFUL VERIFIABLE IN

01:27:57.772 --> 01:27:58.973
AUTHENTIC CONTENT IT WAS A

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.776
DIFFICULT STORIES AND NUMBER

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.378
THREE PRACTICES THAT ARE

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.179
INTENDED TO DECEPTIVELY AND

01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:06.781
SUBSTANTIALLY MANIPULATE OR

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:08.116
DISRUPT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE

THOSE THREE CRITERIA ARE YOU

KNOW TO CONSTITUTE A

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:16.157
MISINFORMATION IN THIS CONTEXT.

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:17.191
BUT BUT ONCE AGAIN THAT THE

01:28:17.258 --> 01:28:18.493
MAJOR DISTINCTION IS THAT WE'RE

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:20.061
NOT ASKING THE PLATFORMS TO

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.963

HAVE SUCH A POLICY. ADDRESSING

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:29.237
THOSE ISSUES AND THEY HAVE TO

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:30.772
MEET THIS OF THREE CRITERIA

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:32.407
THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING WHAT ARE

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:33.708
THE POLICIES THAT WOULD ADDRESS
