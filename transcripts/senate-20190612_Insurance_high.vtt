SERVICES AS BEING A MILLENNIAL

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:34.120
ISSUE AND THE REASON WHY IS THAT

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.389
MY PARENTS MY AND MY PARENTS

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:37.290

SUFFERED THROUGH THE RECESSION

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:41.661
AND SO FOR EXAMPLE MY MOTHER MY

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:42.829
STEPFATHER BUSINESS OWNERS.

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:43.863
THEY LOST EVERYTHING NOT ONLY

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:44.764
DID THEY LOSE OUR BUSINESS

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:47.633
BECAUSE OF OF THE RECESSION ALSO

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.434
LOST THEIR HOME.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.636
AND IN THAT PROCESS TRYING TO

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:51.470
KEEP THE BUSINESS ALIVE THEY

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:53.272
SPEND DOWN ALL THEIR ASSETS ALL

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:54.507
THE RETIREMENT.

ABSOLUTELY EVERY SINGLE PENNY

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:56.843
THEY HAD BECAUSE THERE WAS NO IT

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.144
WASN'T CLEAR HOW LONG THE

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:58.945
RECESSION IS GOING TO LAST SO

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.046
THAT THAT THEY COULD PROP IT UP.

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:01.747
AND RECOUP THAT MONEY LATER ON

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.482
BUT THE RECESSION WAS SO LONG

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:04.016
THAT THEY ENDED UP LOSING

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:08.754
EVERYTHING -- ACTUALLY OTHER.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:09.622
YOUR THEIR SENATOR.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:13.292
CENTER BATES AND SO.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.328
YOU KNOW THE TIME.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:16.963

LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE WHICH

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:20.900
WOULD HELP.

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:21.467
MITIGATE THE COST OF IT NOW

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.903

ATTENDED.

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:28.074
TWELVE SO THE COSTS ARE HIGHER

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.042
IT'S AND ALTERNATELY THE PROBLEM

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:31.077
IN THE REASON WHY CHARACTERIZES

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:45.625
HAVING MOVED BACK IN WITH THOSE

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:47.260
PARENTS WERE REALLY NOT SUITABLE

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:49.562
SUITED TO TAKE ON THOSE COSTS.

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:51.764

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:42.688

UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:45.157
BUT I THINK WE'RE STILL.

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.992
A LITTLE CONFUSED ON WHAT THE

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.293

SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:50.762
OKAY.

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.197
ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL WHAT CAN WE

CONCERN AND CERTAINLY

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:46.712
LEGITIMIZING.

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:49.181

HOW YOU WOULD ARE YOU ON THE

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.293
AGENDA FOR THIS TASK FORCE WOULD

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.394
DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE

00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:03.996
OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD BE

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:05.797
THERE ON SOMETHING THAT'S MORE

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:07.299
NOT JUST PUBLIC INSURANCE WITH

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:08.834
MAYBE A PRIVATE?

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.303
PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP I SEE THAT AS

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.170
A SOLUTION.

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:14.439
OF BECAUSE THE NEW PAYROLL TAX

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:16.708
ON TOP OF PAYROLL TAXES IF OUT

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:17.876
THAT'S THE WAY WE SUPPORT.

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.344
A GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THAT

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.780
STARTS TO BE A DIMINISHING.

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:24.883
OF BENEFIT TO THOSE WHO SEE AB

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.251
THE YOUNGER AGE YOURS THE MONEY

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:27.352
GOING OUT.

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:28.820
AND YOU'RE GONNA SAY -- WHAT

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:29.588
HAPPENS WHEN I DON'T LIVE LONG

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.189
ENOUGH TO NEED LONG TERM CARE

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:32.758
INSURANCE AND IT IS VERY

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:33.892
EXPENSIVE?

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.794
WE HAVE IT IT IS CERTAINLY LESS

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.929
THAN WHAT IT COST YOU.

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:40.065
R. E. N. NOW -- LONG TERM CARE

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.067
MY MOTHER WAS AND THAT IT WAS

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.135
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:45.771
MONTH BUT BECAUSE OF A

00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:47.873
COMBINATION OF YOU KNOW TENSIONS

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:49.074
THAT SHE HAD AND WHAT MY DAD

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.776
PROVIDED FOR WE WERE ABLE TO

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:51.143
SUSTAIN THAT.

00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:51.943
MIGHT LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.514
RIGHT NOW RUNS ABOUT TWO TO IT'S

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.982
NOT [inaudible]

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:59.251
TWO THOUSAND OUR PERSON.

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:00.185
AND THAT IS CERTAINLY LESS THAN

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:02.554
THE COST OF LONG TERM CARE IF

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:03.455
THAT'S GONNA KICK IN THAT IT HAS

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:05.891
A IT'S BASICALLY LIMITED IN

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:07.359
TERMS OF HOW LONG IT.

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:09.127
YOU KNOW IS TO ALL THOSE THINGS

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:10.729

THIS TO ME ARE VERY IMPORTANT I

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:13.932
THINK IT'S A VERY NOBLE CAUSE.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.834
BILL QUESTION BUT I WOULD LIKE

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:18.870

THAT A PROGRAM IS.

00:22:26.545 --> 00:22:28.747
GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND WE

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:30.482
KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:31.983
TALKED IT OUT OF THE CA BECAUSE

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.819
OF THE LACK OF SUSTAINABILITY

00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:35.520
THEY BELIEVE FOR A NATIONWIDE

THERE AND HOW WE MEET THEM IN

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.139
TERMS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:55.307
INSURANCE THAT EVERY.

00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:57.042

MY THE BIGGEST CONCERN I HAVE

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:36.014
RIGHT NOW IS THE FACT THAT.

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:37.482
IT'S AN UNSUSTAINABLE SOLUTION

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:39.084
WHERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T

00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:40.552

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:47.225
JUST.

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:48.794
THAT IS IN A SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.229
MOVING FORWARD I ASSUME NOTHING

00:23:51.296 --> 00:23:53.565
IN THE THE CREATION OF THIS TASK

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:54.266

DIRECTION FOR THIS TO GO WHAT

00:23:58.036 --> 00:23:59.104
I'M TRYINGTO DO IS PUT THE

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:00.205
RIGHT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THE

00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:01.306
RIGHT COLLECTION OF PEOPLE ON A

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:02.808

IN WHAT THAT PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:08.346
I HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN

00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:09.648
MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER THE

00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:10.515
SUGGESTIONS ARE THAT THE

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:12.417
LEGISLATURE'S ULTIMATELY GOING

00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:14.286

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:16.154
THE MOST UP TO DATE BEST

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:17.556
POSSIBLE SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:19.291
TAKING ALL OF THOSE FACTORS INTO

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:20.659
CONSIDERATION TAKING COST
