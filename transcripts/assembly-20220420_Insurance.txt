CHAN. I'M THINKING IN THE INTERESTS OF- EXPEDIENCY THAT I WILL PRESENT MY BILL NOW. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE OPERATING AS A SUB COMMITTEE- THAT WAY YEAH. I CAN TAKE BACK THE GAVEL AND WE CAN GET ON WITH THINGS. ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM. ALL RIGHTY SO MR MAYS I'M GONNA PRESENT MY- LONELY BILL. AND. FIVE PLEASE DO IT FROM FROM HERE. YEAH I'LL DO IT FROM HERE. I WAS JUST REALLY JUST FOR THE RECORD- IN IT BEFORE SKEWS ME MR MAYES- THEREFORE CONSENT CALENDAR BILLS TODAY- BUT WE'LL GET INTO THAT AFTER A ONCE WE HAVE. MORE FOLKS HERE ABOUT SEVENTEEN COMMITTEE HEARINGS HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY- HOUSING IS DOWNSTAIRS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAPPENING. SO THE PERSON'S NEXT DOOR WE'LL WE'LL GET A COUPLE MEMBERS ONCE ONCE THE PURSE COMMITTEE IS FINISHED. SO MY BILL AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY. ADDRESSES THE- DEBT IN OUR STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND. THE BILL PROPOSES TO MAKE A ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF SEVEN POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TOWARD THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR. OUT STANDING DEBT. THE INVESTMENT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE TOTAL INTEREST OWED ON THIS DEBT EASING THE BURDEN ON BUSINESSES AND SUPPORTING THE STATE'S FISCAL STABILITY. THE COST OF PAYING FOR THAT DEBT WILL HIT SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES ALIKE. NEXT YEAR EVERY EMPLOYER IN CALIFORNIA WILL PAY TWENTY ONE DOLLARS MORE PER EMPLOYEE. AND THAT NUMBER WILL DOUBLE. THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AND CONTINUE AT FORTY TWO DOLLARS PER EMPLOYEE UNTIL THE DEBT IS REPAID. BUSINESSES PAY THE PRINCIPAL ON THIS DEBT. THE STATE PAYS THE INTEREST ON THE DEBT. SO WITH THE WITH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SURPLUS I THINK IT'S A PRUDENT INVESTMENT TO USE SOME OF THE SURPLUS TO PAY DOWN THAT DEBT- MR MOULTRIE IS HERE FROM THE- CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AGAIN WE'RE OPERATING AS A SUB COMMITTEE THERE WON'T BE A VOTE ON THIS BILL YET I JUST WANTED TO. MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR AGENDA SO GO AHEAD MR MOULTRIE. THANK YOU MR- THAT MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ROBERT MUTRIE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE REYES SPONSOR AND STRONGLY SUPPORTED B. TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY- ACELERA DALY APTLY TOUCHED ON THE FINANCIAL CONCERNS FOR THE STATE AND FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY I'D LIKE TO JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW POINTS BRIEFLY. FIRST SON INCLEMENT INTEREST TAX INCREASE THAT'S COMING NEXT YEAR WILL HIT SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT SECTORS AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY I'M FROM CALVET LIKE RESTAURANTS AND OTHERS FOR REALLY MANPOWER INTENSIVE AND WILL SEE THE HIGHEST TAX INCREASES AS A RESULT. I DON'T LIKE THE FLAG. ALL SHE POINTS IT THE MIND OF LEGISLATURE FIRST- WE ARE PRESENTLY WORKING AND IF SPOKEN ALLEGE COUNCIL TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO HELP ADDRESS NOT JUST A THE OVERALL INSOLVENCY BUT THE TAX INCREASES ANTICIPATED NEXT YEAR DIRECTLY FOR WORKING ON SOLUTIONS IN THAT DIRECTION WITH THIS BILL. I ALSO LIKE THE FLAG IN AGAIN LIMIT IS ON EVERYONE'S MIND- AS THE L. L. CORRECTLY NOTED THERE FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND PUBLICATION ON THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT WE DO BELIEVE MONEY SPENT THIS WAY CAN HELP ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS WHICH ARE AN OVERALL BUDGET CONCERN FOR LEGISLATORS. IN THE INTEREST OF GRAVITY- I'LL AND THEY'RE NEEDED URGENT I THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU- JUST AS A REMINDER WE ARE ON- AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY- AND THE CHAIR IS PRESENTING- FROM THE DYESS- BUT WE'RE GONNA MOVE- TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION NOT SEEING ANY. OR IS THERE SOME OPPOSITION. YES WE DO HAVE SOME OPPOSITION. BUT I REQUEST FOR ALL THE SUPPORT. YEP THAT'S OKAY WE'LL WE'LL DO THAT THE TESTIMONY THAT WILL POP EVERYBODY CONSISTENT. THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN MITCHELL WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL MANY APOLOGIES FOR THE LATENESS OF OUR OPPOSITION AND FOR NOT HAVING A LETTER AND BUT WE DO HAVE PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIONS TO NOT JUST. ESSENTIALLY PUTTING TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK FOR EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITY BUT ALSO I THINK MORE TO THE POINT THAT WHILE KOBE DEFINITELY PLAYED A ROLE IN THE SIZE OF THIS DEBT THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM HERE'S THE INSOLVENCY OF OUR SYSTEM. AND IF IT IS NOT COVERED IT'S A RECESSION IT'S ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS WAITING IN THE WINGS THAT COULD CAUSE US TO GENERATE ANOTHER MASSIVE DEBT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD THEN NEED A MASSIVE INTEREST PAYMENT FROM THE STATE. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT ANY SORT OF BAIL OUT OF THIS SIZE SHOULD DEFINITELY COME WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE SYSTEM TO PREVENT THIS SORT OF THAT FROM BEING GENERATED IN FUTURE WE ALSO THINK THAT IT ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE MENTIONED THAT BENEFIT LEVELS IN THE STATE ARE WILDLY INADEQUATE THE RIGHT. NOT FOUR HUNDRED FOR MAXIMUM BENEFIT AMOUNT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS. 40% OF WORKERS HIT THAT MAXIMUM CAP AND AS A PAINT AWARE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO FUND EVEN YOUR HOUSING RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE STATE MUCH LESS EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU NEED TO PAY FOR AS A CITIZEN OF THE STATE. AND SO WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT ANY SORT OF A LOT OF THE SITE SHOULD COME WITH AN INCREASE IN BENEFIT LEVELS FOR WORKERS- A REFORM FUNDING STRUCTURE SO THAT WERE BETTER ABLE TO WITHSTAND WHATEVER RECESSIONS ARE COMING IN THE FUTURE. AND ALSO SOME SORT OF A SOLVENCY SURCHARGE THAT OTHER STATES HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE DO NEED TO PAY OFF INTEREST ON A FEDERAL LOAN THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF PAYS FOR THAT THE EMPLOYERS PAY FOR THAT. RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO BACK TO TAXPAYERS TO COVER THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU AND- WITH THAT. WE WILL MOVE TO ALL OF THE ADD ONS- AND MY GUESS IS MOST OF THIS IS SUPPORT BUT WILL DO BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WITH THE- ADD ONS. AT THE- AT THE SAME TIME- JUST AS A REMINDER JUST YOUR NAME AND- ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION.

A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M FRANCESCA SCHULER I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FITNESS ALLIANCE. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN NINETY SIX WHICH WOULD PAY BACK THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE LOANS- TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEVEN CHOI. FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL-BECAUSE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH MOST FITNESS BUSINESSES ARE SMALL BUSINESSES- NEED OUR SUPPORT AT THIS CRITICAL. TIME OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THE CALIFORNIA FITNESS ALLIANCE MISSION IS SIMPLE IT'S TO PROMOTE A HEALTHY AND FIT CALIFORNIA. AS THE UNITED VOICE OF ALL THE FITNESS PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA. THE CFA IS MADE UP OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. AND OVER THREE THOUSAND FITNESS CENTERS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR PARTNERS AND BRANDS EMPLOYED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS MANY OF THEM SINGLE PARENTS- AND PEOPLE WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES WHO CAN'T FIND EMPLOYMENT AT. ANYWHERE ELSE. WHO ARE ALL COMMITTED TO PROVIDING SAFE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTLETS FOR MILLIONS EACH YEAR. BUT OUR FITNESS CENTERS CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER TAX HIKE WHEN WE ARE STILL REELING FROM THE EFFECTS OF COVERT FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW THE FITNESS INDUSTRY WAS ONE OF THE- ONLY INDUSTRIES THAT RECEIVED NO DIRECT RELIEF NATIONAL OR STATE. DURING THE PANDEMIC WE DID NOT QUALIFY FOR MOST OF THE RELIEF EFFORTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO RESTAURANTS AND OTHER. BUSINESSES FITNESS DID NOT GET THAT. AS A RESULT IN CALIFORNIA- WE'RE ESTIMATING ANYWHERE FROM 35240% OF ALL FITNESS CENTERS ARE CAN BE PERMANENTLY CLOSED. FOR THOSE OF YOU WORK OUT MAY VERY WELL LIKE WE HAVE A LOCAL FITNESS CENTER THAT WILL NOT REOPEN. ON THE FLIP SIDE THOSE THAT ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO SURVIVE THEY'RE STILL BUILDING BACK TO BUSINESS PAYING DOUBLE RENT WITH THE FOR GRANT XCERRA. SO JUST TRYING TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES TO BE HEALTHY. AND PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE TO EXERCISE FOR MANY WHO CAN'T AFFORD HOME GYMS OR THINGS LIKE THAT. THE FITNESS CENTERS AND BUSINESSES STATEWIDE SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO BEAR YET ANOTHER ECONOMIC BURDENS. CORNER ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STATE CAN TAKE LEGISLATIVE ACTION REPLACE REPAY ITS UNEMPLOYMENT LOANS. WITH AB FIFTEEN NINETY SIX THE STATE WOULD APPROPRIATE OVER NINETEEN BILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT SO THE STATE WOULD PAY OFF ALL OF ITS ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT ACCOUNT- I NEED YOU TO WRAP UP PLEASE THAT'S THE WORRIES THANK YOU- AND SO GIVEN THE STATE'S BUDGET SURPLUS THE STATE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY REDUCES UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND REALLY SHIELD. SO MANY OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE STILL TRYING TO RECOVER AND BRING BACK THEIR EMPLOYEES. WHO HAVE CURRENTLY NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK FOR THESE REASONS THE CFA IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN NINETY SIX. AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I'M SORRY. WE TOOK A WHEN YOU DO STABBED QUORUM THAT'S WHY I WAS GETTING A LITTLE JUMPY. BECAUSE IT'S A PRECIOUS THING TO HAVE A QUORUM THAT WAY WE CAN VOTE- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND LET'S ESTABLISH THE QUORUM NOW PLEASE. DALY HERE DALY HERE MAYES HERE MAYES HERE BERMAN.

DID CUT THEIR EMPLOYER TAXES DURING THE PANDEMIC WHILE ALSO INCREASING THE MINIMUM BENEFIT FROM TWO HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS A WEEK TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS A WEEK. OUR MINIMUM BENEFIT IS FORTY DOLLARS A WEEK SO THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH ARE YOU AYE SYSTEM AND WE REALLY THINK THAT. LOST IN THE CONVERSATION OF HOW BEST TO DEAL WITH THE LOOMING TAX INCREASES THAT EMPLOYERS ARE FACING IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN DIRE NEED OF A FUNDAMENTAL OVERHAUL OF OUR SYSTEM THAT. NOT ONLY PREVENTS THINGS LIKE TAX INCREASES HAPPENING DURING TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES BUT ALSO RAISES BENEFITS FOR WORKERS AND ALLOWS. THE STATE TO RELIEVE ITSELF OF THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR THE INTEREST ON THE FEDERAL LOANS PUT THAT RESPONSIBILITY BACK INTO THE SYSTEM WHERE IT WHERE IT BELONGS WE ARE JOB POSITION.

WE'VE DONE YEP YOUR TIMING IS PERFECT WITNESSES SURE YEAH- GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE PREVENTS THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN KEY APPOINTED% DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE STAFF FROM CONDUCTING A COVERED COMMUNICATION UNLESS THEY DISCLOSE AND PUBLISH THE COMMUNICATION ON THE DEPARTMENT WEBSITE THE PUBLIC INTEREST PRINCIPLES OF FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS OF LAW REQUIRES THAT THE COMMISSIONER AND DEPARTMENT STAFF CONDUCT THEIR AFFAIRS IN AN OPEN OBJECTIVE AND IMPARTIAL MANNER FREE OF UNDUE INFLUENCE AND THE ABUSE OF POWER. AND AUTHORITY. AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE PROVIDES THAT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND KEY COMMISSIONER APPOINTEE SHALL NOT MAKE A COVER COMMUNICATION LESS THEY DISCLOSE AND MAKE PUBLIC THAT COMMUNICATION BY REPORTING AND PUBLISHING SUCH COMMUNICATIONS QUARTERLY ON THE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNET WEBSITE. SPECIFICALLY THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ADOPT A STANDARD DISCLOSURE FORM FOR REPORTING COVERED COMMUNICATIONS THAT SHALL INCLUDE THE DATE TIME AND LOCATION OF THE COMMUNICATION THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON OR PERSONS INITIATING AND THE PERSON OR PERSONS RECEIVING THE COMMUNICATION. THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON ON WHOSE BEHALF THE COMMUNICATION WAS MADE. THE IDENTITY OF ALL PERSONS PRESENT DURING THE COMMUNICATION. AND THE TOPIC OF COMMUNICATION IN ESSENCE. A CALENDAR ENTRY. TO BE EFFECTIVE IN FOR A HEALTHY ECONOMY CALIFORNIA'S REGULATION OF THE BUSINESS OF INSURANCE REQUIRES PUBLIC AWARENESS. UNDERSTANDING SUPPORT PARTICIPATION AND CONFIDENCE IN THE COMMISSIONER. DEPARTMENT STAFF AND THEIR PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES ACCORDINGLY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE PUBLIC'S WELFARE THE INTEGRITY OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS. AND TO MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN THE COMMISSIONER THANK YOU DEPARTMENT APPOINTEES WITH ME TODAY AS A WITNESS I HAVE COMMON BOBBER OF CONSUMER WATCHDOG. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS THANKS FOR HAVING ME HI MY NAME'S CARMEN BULBAR AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CONSUMER WATCHDOG. OF AND WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS THE MOST POWERFUL CONSUMER REGULATOR- IN ANY STATE IN THE NATION. HE MAKES DECISIONS THAT DALY AFFECT THE POCKETBOOKS OF EVERY CALIFORNIA INDIVIDUAL AND BUSINESS OWNER- AS HE OVERSEES THE THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR PLUS INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA AND WITH THE POWER AND AUTHORITY COMES THE OBLIGATION FOR INTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY. AND IT'S BEEN MADE VERY CLEAR BY RECENT EVENTS THAT CRITICAL DECISIONS AT CDI ARE BEING MADE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AFTER THE COMMISSIONER AND THE QUESTION IS TOP DEPUTIES MEET WITH INTERESTED PARTIES IN THOSE DECISIONS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN AN INVESTIGATION UNCOVERED THAT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAD TAKEN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH MATTERS BEFORE THE AGENCY ONE OF THOSE DECISIONS ARE ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES WAS FACING ACTIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT. FOR OVER CHARGING BUSINESSES FOR THEIR WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE THE COMMISSIONER THEN INTERVENED IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS AND REVERSE DECISIONS BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES. COMMISSIONER LOTTA LEADER ADMITTED THAT HE HAD MET WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY TO DISCUSS THOSE DECISIONS AND ALSO THE STATUS OF A MERGER OF THE COMPANY WAS SEEKING. LATER THROUGH A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST AND THEN A LAWSUIT THE CONSUMER WATCHDOG WAS REQUIRED TO FILE BECAUSE THE COMMISSIONER AND THE DEPARTMENT WERE NOT FORTHCOMING WITH RECORDS OF THESE MEETINGS AND COMMUNICATIONS WE DISCOVERED THAT OTHER OFFICIALS OF THE CDI. HAD HAD UNDISCLOSED CONVERSATIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THIS INSURANCE COMPANY INCLUDING LOBBYISTS WHO HAD BEEN PROMISED A TWO MILLION DOLLARS SUCCESS FEE OF FOR WINNING THE MERGER THE COMPANY WAS SEEKING. NONE OF THESE PRIVATE MEETINGS WOULD HAVE EVER COME TO LIGHT IF THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS HADN'T FIRST DRAWN MEDIA ATTENTION BUT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT THESE COMMUNICATIONS ARE HAPPENING WHO IS INFLUENCING THE COMMISSIONER PRO ACTIVELY INSTEAD OF HAVING TO WAIT FOR A SCANDAL. THAT SPURS MEDIA OR OTHER INVESTIGATION. AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE PROVIDES- THAT TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING THE COMMISSIONER IN ONLY THE HIGHEST LEVEL APPOINTEES TO RECORD AND REPORT THEIR COMMUNICATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND THIS OLD ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY IS CRUCIAL TO RESTORE THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE OPERATIONS AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. SO AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT FREQUENTLY COMMUNICATES WITH THE CIA- AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS WE WELCOME THIS KIND OF SUNSHINE WE HOPE THAT THE COMMISSIONER AND THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WOULD WELCOME A WOULD WELCOME IT TOO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU MISS BALLBAR ARE THERE OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ARE THERE PERSONS HERE WHO WISH TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. I SEE ONE PERSON- COMING TO THE FORE GO AHEAD SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SEREN TAYLOR ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE HOPEFULLY YOU SEEN OUR LETTER AND KNOW THAT WE ARE POSED TO THE BILL FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST NOT EVERY BILL AIMS TO BE ABOUT TRANSPARENCY ACTUALLY IS. WE THINK AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE IMPOSES NEW COMPLEXITY ON CD I OPERATIONS THAT WILL WASTE TIME AND RESOURCES BUT IT DOES NOT SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST FOR INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THERE ARE NUMEROUS TRANSPARENCY LAWS THAT CURRENTLY APPLY TO CDI INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT APA GOVERNING EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS AND THE PUBLIC RESOURCES ACT P. R. A. WHICH PROVIDES FOR ACCESS TO ALL PUBLIC RECORDS AND INFORMATION. YEAH I HAS ALSO ADOPTED AN ADDITIONAL RULES THAT GO BEYOND THE APA. SO IT IS ALREADY MORE PROTECTIVE THAN OTHER STATE ENTITIES OR EVEN REQUIRED TO BE. HOWEVER THE MAJOR CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS NOT THAT IT'S UNNECESSARY OR WASTEFUL. IT'S THAT THE THREAT OF CIVIL FINES AGAINST CDI STAFF FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE POTENTIAL AWARD OF ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER COSTS. WILL DISRUPT CDI OPERATIONS AND CHILL THE EXERCISE OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. BY DIS INCENTIVIZING THE COMMISSIONER AND CDI APPOINTEES FROM ENGAGING IN CONVERSATIONS PERMITTED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. WITH THE ENTITIES SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY TI. INSURERS ALREADY FIND IT CHALLENGING TO WORK WITH CITY AYE BUREAUCRACY AND ADDING LAWS THAT THREATEN THE STAFF. AND INTERRUPT THE FREE FLOW OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS. AND ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. AT A TIME WHEN REALLY WE ONLY GREATER COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION. TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES IN THE INSURANCE MARKET. IS HARMFUL ALL CALIFORNIANS. SO IN SUMMARY WE THINK THIS BILL WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. BUT IT WILL IMPEDE CITY I OPERATIONS CREATE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION FOR T THE CIVIC AND- THAT'S ALL NEIGHBORHOOD. BUSINESS LABOR TRADE OR SIMILAR ORGANIZATION WHO NEEDS TO WORK ON A MATTER BEFORE CDI. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER TAYLOR. OTHER COMMENTS- IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL GOOD MORNING MR DAILY. MEMBERS MATT POWERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF- CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES- I JUST LIKE TO LET MYSELF FOR THE COMMENT CALLING MR TAYLOR- WE CONTINUE TO HAVE STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT THE WORKABILITY OF THE REPORTING THIS MEASURE REQUIRES. AT THE CORE MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS EMPLOYEES THE REGULATION OF THE INSURANCE MARKETS. AND THE PORT IN THE DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES FINITE. ADDING IT DAILY AND WEEKLY ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND SERVICEABLE POORLY DEFINED PROBLEM IS A DISTRACTION FROM THE IMPORTANT WORK AND RIGHT OF REGULATING CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. FURTHERMORE THE CIVIL PENALTIES OF UP TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PLUS LEGAL FEES- THIS PROPOSAL SUBJECTS THE DEPARTMENT'S EMPLOYEES TO. IT'S COMPLETELY DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE HARM AN INFRACTION WOULD CAUSE. FOR COMPARISON NON FILING OF F. PPC CAMPAIGN REPORTS ARE SUBJECT TO TEN DOLLAR DAILY FEET FINDS. SIMPLY PUT THE CIVIL PENALTY PROVISION WILL INSTILL A CULTURE OF FEAR. AND CUT OFF COMMUNICATION WITH SENIOR DEPARTMENT THE STAFF WHICH IS INTEGRAL TO THE WELL FUNCTIONING OF MARKETPLACE AND REGULATOR THANK FOR MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER POWERS OTHER. COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION. THIS IS YOUR MEMBERS MAINLY ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION ALIGNING OURSELVES WITH PREVIOUS SPEAKERS MCKEE REPRESENTING THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR ON THE BILL MR VOEPEL- A MINOR QUESTION AND THEN A COMMENT IF I MAY GO AHEAD. HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT SPARKED ALL THIS OFF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND THAT IS THE CURRENT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CORRECT OKAY- MY COMMENT IS. WHEN YOU CROSS INSURANCE REGULATION WITH POLITICS THERE'S GOING GOING TO BE SOME PROBLEMS THERE ALWAYS HAS BEEN ALWAYS WILL BE- I AM IN OPPOSITION AND ALL THE POINTS MADE BY THE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION- ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON- LOOKING AT THIS FROM AN INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS VIEWPOINT. MANY TIMES THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WILL REACH OUT TO A BROKER A COMPANY A BROKERAGE FIRM- EVEN ADMITTED OR NON ADMITTED COMPANIES. WITH ENQUIRE RES HEY WHAT DO YOU DO IT BASICALLY NOW IF IT'S AN INNOCENT INQUIRE RE ON A COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE OR PROCEDURES. MANY TIMES. THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS SATISFIED NOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE IN THE CHILLING EFFECT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS I'M A BROKER A INSURANCE COMMISSIONER QUESTIONS SOME OF MY PRACTICES WELL WITH THE DISCLOSURE WITHIN SEVEN DAYS AND CIVIL FINES NOW IT'S NOT JUST A ENQUIRING IT'S NOT JUST. TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ON THE REGULATORS PART NOW IT'S A INQUISITION. IN A CAN BE USED BY MY COMPETITORS IT CAN BE USED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE ON RECORD. SO THAT'S MY COMMENT THERE SIR GOOD YEAH IF I IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR- AND I RESPECT MR VOCALS- CONCERNS IN IN POSITION ON. I THINK THAT WHAT GOT YOUR ATTENTION AND- AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS WHAT COLOR YOUR ENTIRE VIEWPOINT OF WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID BUT BUT WHAT YOU LEAD WITH WAS. WHEN DID THE CONTRIBUTIONS OCCUR. AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS AREN'T ACTUALLY THE POINT OF THIS BILL THE COUNTRY SINCE EARLY HAVE NO IMPACT ON THIS BILL THE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY JUST A MINOR PART. OF THE STORY. IT WAS WHAT I DREW PEOPLE TO ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS. WE WITHOUT THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST TO UNDERSTAND. YES IT COULD CONTRIBUTIONS HAPPENED BUT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT OVERRULING OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES DEALING WITH THAT THAT DONOR. SO WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WASN'T THE CONTRIBUTION WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WHAT IS IMPORTANT. WHAT ARE THE MEETINGS THAT OCCURRED THAT LED TO OVERTURNING STAFF. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR CAREERS REGULATING A THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR INSURANCE MARKET THE FOURTH LARGEST INSURANCE MARKET IN THE IN THE WORLD. WHAT WERE THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL GETS TO IT'S NOT ABOUT THE POLITICS OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE COMMUNICATIONS ARE SO IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND LIKE WHY. PUT AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT OVER CHARGED SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WHY WOULD THEY BE LET OFF THE HOOK. WHEN ALL OF THE STAFF REGULATORS SAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT COMMUNICATIONS OCCURRED. ALL RIGHT SIR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE ARCHER WHO HAD MISTER MAYES- I THINK THAT THE AUTHORS UP. PURPOSE IN THIS- IS IN TRYING TO- TO WRITE SOMETHING HE SEES AS A AS A WRONG- I JUST HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN SUPPORTED IN BACK ON MY TIME. AS A CITY COUNCILMEMBER WHEN DEALING WITH EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS AS IT APPLIED TO PLANNING COMMISSIONERS. OF THE FIRST MEMBER THE U. S. CONSTITUTION IS VERY VERY CLEAR- AND ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL PARTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT IS THE ABILITY TO BUILD A PETITION- ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES- WHEN I HAVE A CONSTITUENT THE COMES. AND MEETS WITH ME AND THAT CONVERSATION THAT I HAVE WITH THAT CONSTITUENT AS CONSTITUENT IS PRIVATE BETWEEN ME AND THEM AND THEN WE DON'T MAKE NOTES AND TAKE NOTES WE DON'T PUBLICIZE. OF THOSE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE- FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THOSE THAT ARE PETITIONING THEM AND I THINK THE RULES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IN REGARDS THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND OTHER THINGS- IS MORE THAN ENOUGH- THAT THEN AND I THINK THIS JUST GOES. A GOES TOO FAR SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- THIS BILL OF. IS ON THE AGENDA TODAY AS A- THE COURTESY TO THE AUTHOR WHO WE ALL RESPECT- BUT THERE IS NO RECOMMENDATION- MAKE GOES ALONG WITH THE ANALYSIS- THE ANALYSIS LAYS OUT ALL THE ISSUES IN THE PROS AND THE CONS. SO WHERE DID I HEAR A MOTION I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ONE MOTION ONE MAKER OF THE MOTION. IS THERE A SECOND. WELL WE DON'T HAVE A FULL COMMITTEE YET MR LEVINE THERE MAY BE OTHERS WHO ARRIVE- MR COOLEY IS OUTWITH AN ILLNESS AND THAT THERE IS A REPLACEMENT FOR HIM MISS GARCIA. SO WELL WE WILL- WE WILL A- PROCEED WITHOUT VOTING ON THIS BILL YET. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR CARRYING THIS OUT THIS BILL IS NOT TO CHILL COMMUNICATION AT ALL IT DOES NOT STOP COMMUNICATION ONE BIT IT DOESN'T SAY THAT YOU CAN'T CONTACT THE REGULATOR AND STAFF- SO IT DOES NOT DISCOURAGE THAT AT ALL OF COURSE IF THERE ARE ISSUES THAT HAVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT IS COVERED DIFFERENTLY- UNDER THE LAW SO IT DOESN'T- REVEAL ANYTHING THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE REVEALED IN IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS MISTER MAYES Y. I HEAR YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THAT AS WELL. BECAUSE I HADN'T IN THE PAST HAD CONCERNS ABOUT EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS AND WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE CAN GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS- AND WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO IT- TO OCCUR- SO AS THIS BILL KIND OF SITS IN YOUR MIND AND YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO DIGEST IT AND THINK ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION- PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING A SECOND. WHEN NOT WHEN THE BILL COMES UP YET AGAIN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU DOCTOR WITH BY THE WAY FOR THAT MOTION- I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND SO PLEASE WITH YOUR CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

AND THE SERVICE WORKERS PARTICULARLY IN THE FOOD SERVICE THAT FEED FAMILIES- HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND YET THEY STRUGGLE TO FEED THEIR OWN. AND ALONG WITH THE MANY VETS AT LABOR AND SO MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS AND MAKE UP THE LABOR COMMUNITY OF CALIFORNIA THAT REALLY SUPPORT AND UNDERGIRDED KANEMI. OF OUR STATE.
