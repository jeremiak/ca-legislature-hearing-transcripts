SOMETHING COMPLICATED WHICH IS

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.408
THAT IT'S BASICALLY THE PRIMARY

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.542
SOURCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

BEFORE THAT WORKING WITH WHICH

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.763
THOMAS- IT'S CLEAR THAT EVERY

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.965
SINGLE PASS AND CHAT. AND

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:35.368
COMMITTEE WANTS TO MOVE AWAY TO

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.403
LESS TOXIC PESTICIDES IF YOU

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.873
TALK TO FARMWORKERS OLE-

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.742
FAMILIES THEY EAT FOOD ALL

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.911
SUPERMARKETS THAT SELL FOOD-

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.180
THE FARMERS THEMSELVES. I'M SO

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:49.215
WE THIS THIS IS REALLY PART OF

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.817
AN INTEGRATED PLAN TO THINK

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:52.552
ABOUT HOW TO MOVE CALIFORNIA

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:54.253
TOWARDS LESS TOXIC PESTICIDES

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.222
ISN'T THE SOLE WAY OF DOING IT

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:56.956
BUT IT'S PART OF THAT

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.358
TRANSITION. SO AT THE MOMENT

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:00.693
WITH SENDING A PRETTY CLEAR

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.529
SIGNAL- THAT'LL PESTICIDES ARE

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:06.032
EQUAL BY TEARING IT NAMELY THE

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.101
MORE TOXIC PESTICIDE THE HIGHER

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.936
THE FEES WILL BE ASSESSED FOR

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.904
SENDING A CLEAR MARKET SIGNAL.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.740
TO EVERYONE TO MOVE TOWARDS

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:17.110
LESS TOXIC MATERIALS- AND WE

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:20.046
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A AND

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.914
NECESSARY IN INNOVATIVE CHANGES

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.850
SUPPORTS. THIS TRANCE

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.551
TRANSFORMATION AS I DESCRIBED

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:28.154
IT SAYS. ONE ONE OF THE MAIN

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.789
WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP FARMERS

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:33.392
AND I WAS RECENTLY- IN FRESNO

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.361
TALKING TO FARMERS WAS. THAT

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.696
THEIR ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.965
OFTEN A WILLINGNESS CHAD TO DO

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:40.600
IT BUT NOT THE TOOLS TO HELP.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.603
FARMERS WHO INCREDIBLY BUSY I'M

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.271
DOING A WHOLE SET OF THINGS I

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:46.773
UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE THAT

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.342
CHANGE SO THE KID MAILED BOTH

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:50.843
ENCOURAGES THE USE OF LAST TEXT

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.845
TOXIC PESTICIDES BUT ALSO MOST

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.981
IMPORTANTLY. AND THIS IS KIND

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.482
OF I THINK A KEY ISSUE THAT'S

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:57.750
COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN IN OUR

00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.552
DISCUSSIONS PEOPLE ARE SAYING

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:02.221
WELL. WHY DON'T YOU JUST FIND

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:04.423
THE BUDGET DEFICIT- THAT EXISTS

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.925
WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:07.393

EIGHT AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS.

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:10.229
AND WE'RE SAYING IN ORDER TO

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:11.364
MAKE THIS CHANGE WE REALLY NEED

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.799
TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT AND

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:14.767

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.116
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TWO THINGS

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:05.484
WE HAVE. ENFORCEMENT THAT

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:06.586
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WE HAVE

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.554
NOTIFICATION SO. PEOPLE

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:09.822
UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY'RE BEING

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.924
SPRAYED. ALL THE FIELDS

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.259
ADJACENT TO THEM BEING SPRAYED

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.594
AND WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.028
THE EXACT ENVIRONMENTAL

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:19.365
OUTCOMES ARE. SO IN SUMMARY- WE

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.601
REALLY WANT TO. DO EVERYTHING

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:22.969
THAT WE CAN TO SPEED UP THE

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:24.904
DEVELOPMENT AND MOVEMENT

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:26.606
TOWARDS EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.140
THAT'S WHERE. THIS HAS TO

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.443
HAPPEN- WE NEED TO SPEED THAT

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:32.345
RESEARCH PROCESS OUT SO THAT WE

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:35.248
CAN- ALSO SPEED UP DEPARTMENT

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:37.116
OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. SO

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.918
THAT THE HEAD LESS TOXIC

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:41.387
PESTICIDES ALL THE ALTERNATIVES

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:46.392
THE. QUICKER THEY GO ON TO THE

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.627
MARKET. SO JUST FOR CONTEXT

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:48.261
WE'VE BEEN USED THESE INTEGRATE

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:50.730
PEST MANAGEMENT. PRACTICE TODAY-

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:52.031
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE OTHER

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.499
ELEMENTS IN THE ISLAMIC

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.369
PROGRAMS- WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE

00:08:56.435 --> 00:09:00.640
TRANSITION AWAY FROM- FROM HIS

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:01.774
ZERO TAYWAN TRACTORS THAT

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:03.109
THERE'S A WHOLE PAUL PATTON IN

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:04.443
PRACTICE THE PEOPLE ARE DOING

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.845
IT WE JUST WANT TO. DO THIS IN

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:08.080
THE CONTEXT OF PESTICIDES MOVE

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:11.918
THOSE TO HAPPEN QUICKER. SO WE-

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.953
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS THIS IS

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.056
THE TIME TO DO IT- WE NEED THE

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.759
FUNDING TO HELP MAKE- THE

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:22.261
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT- REMOVES

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:23.562
AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF NOT

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.731

EXPAND AND MONITORING THAT'S

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:29.135
ANOTHER CRITICAL ELEMENT THAT

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:31.070
HAPPENS IN THIS PLANCHETTE. IS

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:32.405
WE TRIED TIME AND TIME AGAIN

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:33.940
THAT WHEN MEASURING THE TOXIC

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.942
AND CRITERIA. I AND

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:37.443
CONTAMINANTS BUT WOULD NOT

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.345
MEASURING PESTICIDES INSTEAD OF

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.613
WORKING WITH THE END RESULT IS

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.948
BALD WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SET UP

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:44.250
PILOTS. WE NEED TO EXPAND THAT

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:47.353
NOW. I'M WE CONTINUE TO WORK

BRANDS THAT SELL THESE BUT A

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.600
NON TOXIC WINDOW CLEANER. WOULD

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:57.002
BE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A BLEACH

AND BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:10.549
THAT PLAYS OUT ACROSS THE

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:13.519

THAT VERY COMPLEX AGRICULTURAL

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.045
SYSTEM- SO I DON'T WANT TO BE

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:14.813

CALIFORNIA AND I THINK HAVING

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.622
THAT VOCAL ARM OF A REGULATORY

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.958

CONTINUAL ADAPTATION THAT IT'S

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.898
DONE- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

COMES TO NEW REGULATORY

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.701

COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:45.010
NEW REGULATIONS ARE BUT THE

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.278
CHANGES ARE AND HOW TO

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.180
OPERATIONALIZE THAT SO THEY ARE

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:49.781
VERY IMPORTANT PARTNERS PRESS

THE ROLE BECAUSE. IT IS UNIQUE

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.621
TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:20:55.687 --> 00:20:57.623
SECONDLY WE HAVE LOST OVER THE

00:20:57.689 --> 00:20:59.391
LAST TWO DECADES IN PARTICULAR

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:00.993
SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO THE

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:02.227
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.763

WHICH IS OVERSEAS COOPERATIVE

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.403
EXTENSION. AND THE INSTITUTIONS

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.605
THAT ARE HELD ON CAMPUSES. WITH

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:16.274
SPECIALIST WE DO THE RESEARCH

KNOWLEDGE. AND GIVE US WHAT WE

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:22.280
NEED TO BUILD OUT PROGRAMS BUT

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:23.782
WHAT MAKES BUT COOPERATIVE

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:26.284
EXTENSION SYSTEM. SUCH A VALUE

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:28.687
PROPOSITION IS THE TRANSLATION

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:31.890
OF THOSE RESEARCH FINDINGS. TO

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.525
THE END USER AND A VERY

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:36.294
PRACTICAL WAY IN THEIR REGION

00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:37.562
AND THEIR CROPS. THEY

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:39.097
OFTENTIMES ARE DOING FIELD

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:40.499
TRIALS TO BE ABLE TO SHOW

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:43.068
WHAT'S POSSIBLE. AND BEING ABLE

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.936
TO INVEST THE MAP. ON A ON A

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:47.172
CONTINUAL BASIS WILL MAKE A

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:48.907
DIFFERENCE- IT'S LOST THAT

00:21:58.784 --> 00:21:59.317
SMALL GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:01.720
RUN. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY IT'S

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:02.988
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:04.523
CALIFORNIA FOR THE IN BASIC

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:06.758
PASSED PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:07.626
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:09.961
AGRICULTURE. WE OFTEN TIMES

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:11.463
WHEN THERE'S A NEW CAST WE ARE

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.465

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:15.333
APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THOSE

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.836
INFESTATIONS. AND WE CONSTANTLY

00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:19.538
ARE LOOKING TO OUR PARTNERS AT

FUNDING. THAT THEY CAN USE TO

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.657
MAKE SURE THEY GOT BOOTS ON THE

DATA THAT COMES IN. THERE IS HE

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.805
IS IT EASY TO SEPARATE- THIS IS

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:29.173
THE DEPARTMENT PESTICIDES THIS

TRUCKS DIESEL TRUCKS I MEAN IT

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:37.715
IS THAT SOME OF THE CHEMICALS

00:33:37.782 --> 00:33:39.217
THAT SHOW UP COULD ONLY BE FROM

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:42.353
THE PESTICIDES RIGHT AYE AYE OR

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.021
TO MATCH AND- RIGHT AND SO THE-

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:47.892

FACILITIES THAT THAT DOES

00:34:08.413 --> 00:34:10.181
PESTICIDE IT IS BASICALLY

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:11.215
DIFFERENT TYPES OF EQUIPMENT

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:13.818

FIVE ALL OF THAT ARE THAT AND

00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:28.299
MONITORING THAT LOOKS UPSET OR-

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:31.102
OR DUST YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:33.371
ABLE TO GET THAT LEVEL OF DATA

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:34.906
THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT I'D

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:35.873
SAY IS THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.209
THAT EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:39.444
PROCESS SO AS WE DURING

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.012
COMMUNITY MEETINGS. TO

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:43.915

THAT INTEGRATE. MANAGEMENT DOES

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:04.502
LIVE. PESTICIDES JUST REDO THEM

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:07.104
SO ON THIS WE'RE GONNA IT- PUMP

00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:08.906
UP THE GRANT PROGRAM IN THE OUT

INVESTMENT INTO. THE NON GRANT

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:28.119
IPM PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HERE

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:30.388
DPR WHICH INCLUDE ARE HEALTHY

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:34.859
SCHOOLS. PROGRAM IN. AND

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.093
VARIOUS OTHERS HE AT THE TO

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:36.894
WE'VE CREATED INTEGRATED

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:39.130
CUSTOMER BRANCH IN. THE LAST

00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:40.631
COUPLE OF YEARS WHICH REALLY

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:42.667
HAS WORKED WITH. CHILD CARE

00:36:42.733 --> 00:36:44.335
CENTERS AND SCHOOLS AND OTHER

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:45.736
SENSITIVE SITES AROUND THE

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:47.939
STATE TO ENSURE THAT FROM TO

00:36:48.005 --> 00:36:49.206
ADMINISTER THE KINDS OF%

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:50.942
PESTICIDES THAT YOU MAY FIND IN

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:52.643
THE CLEANING CLOSET. ARE DOING

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.745
SO IN A WAY THAT. DOESN'T

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:55.947
IMPACT THE HEALTH OF STUDENTS

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:57.481
OR OTHERS WHO WORK IN THOSE

00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:58.549
ENVIRONMENTS FOR THE

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.284
APPLICATORS THEMSELVES. SO

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:01.319
THEY'RE SORT OF A TWIN

00:37:01.385 --> 00:37:03.721
INVESTMENT INTO BOTH THE GRANT

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:05.289
PROGRAMS AT DPR WHICH ARE

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:06.958
SUBSTANTIAL HAVE YOU KNOW THE-

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:08.793
REALLY IMPORTANT RESULTS. AS

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:13.898
WELL AS THE IPM PROGRAMS. THAT

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:14.632
WE HAVE HERE IN HOUSE. SECTOR

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:16.100
RESCUE JUMP IN REAL QUICK I THE

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:18.436
CITY OF. I WOULD LOVE TO OUR

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:20.271
GRANT PROGRAMS ARE FAIRLY SMALL

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.138
PROGRAMS THAT THEY'REVERY

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:23.174
EFFECTIVE THEY DO IN SEVERAL

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.209
THINGS ONE IS WITHIN A STATE

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:26.844
THAT HAS FOUR HUNDRED CROSS

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:29.347
MANY OF THEM ARE SO SPECIALIZED

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:31.482
THAT IT'S HARD TO ATTRACT. A

00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:32.850
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:35.019
CREATE PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.654
FOR SOME OF THOSE CROPS THERE

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:38.689
IS A REGIONAL APPROACH THAT'S

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:39.690
FUNDED THROUGH THE FARM BILL

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.592
CALLED I ARE FOR THAT IS

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:43.361
SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT SOME OF

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:44.395
THOSE WHAT WE CALL BURKE AND

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:45.997
CROPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.965
HAVE ALTERNATIVES. AND BEING

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:49.500
ABLE TO PUT SOME STATE FUNDING

00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:51.302
OUT THERE WITH THAT KIND OF

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:52.803
WORK IS A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.271
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.607
TO THE MOST TOXIC PESTICIDES AS

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:59.276
A WAY TO GET THAT SYSTEM GOING

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:00.177
IN THAT DIRECTION THAT'S ONE

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:01.746
WAY WE DO OURS. THE OTHER ONE

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:04.081
IS IN IN RESTARTING THE

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:04.882
BIOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED FARMING

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.918
SYSTEM THIS IS ABOUT- A

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:09.887
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:10.755
COULD BE A RESOURCE

00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:12.523
CONSERVATION DISTRICT IT COULD

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.024
BE USED TO COOPERATIVE

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.459
EXTENSION. THAT ORGANIZES

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:17.895
GROUPS OF FARMERS- IN A REGION

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.897
AROUND THE COMMODITY TO DO

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:22.633
DEMONSTRATION OF HOW TO DO MORE

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.502
SYSTEMS APPROACH TO NOT JUST

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:25.469
LOOK AT THE PAST MANAGEMENT

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:27.738
CASE BUT TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:29.640
SYSTEM INCLUDING SOIL HEALTH

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:31.542
AND OTHER PRACTICES THAT WILL

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:33.511
REDUCE THE PAST PRESSURE AND

00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:35.012
REDUCE THE NEED FOR

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.747
INTERVENTION. AND THIS IS THE

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.282
WAY WE'RE FOCUSING ON

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:40.317
INCORPORATING ALTERNATIVES TO

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:42.186
THE MOST TAXED TAXING PAKCIK

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:44.255
PESTICIDES AND OUR THIRD ONE IS

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:47.058
ON PROACTIVE I PM. WHERE WE

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:48.059
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE OUR

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:50.761
MAPPING TOOLS TO SEE EMERGING

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.797
PAST ISSUES AGAIN IT'S

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:55.266
PARTNERING WITH THE RESEARCHER

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:56.901
COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND A

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:59.403
COMMODITY GROUP TO START TO

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.105
TEST WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.873
WAYS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.575
IMMEDIATELY SHOULD THAT HAPPEN

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:05.810
AND THAT'S USUALLY AROUND

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:08.879
BIOCONTROL WHICH IS FINDING A

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:12.283
FRIENDLY PASSED. THAT WILL WILL

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:14.452
DESTROY THE AND BASIC PASSED

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:19.857
THOSE ARE. THREE EXAMPLES OF

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:20.391
HOW WE USE OUR VERY SMALL

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:21.625
PROGRAMS REALLY. BEST AS A

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:23.060
WHOLE. I WOULD SAY PRO. THAT

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:25.730
PAIR OF. THEMSELVES DOING

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.498
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:29.133
OTHER FARMERS WITH COOPERATIVE

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.535
EXTENSION ON FIELD TRIALS IS

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:33.003
ONE OF OUR MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.472
AT GETTING THOSE PRACTICES OUT

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:35.973
THERE AND REALLY GETTING

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.209
ADAPTATION AT SCALE IN

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:40.444
CALIFORNIA. EXCELLENT AND I

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:41.779
KNOW SECRETARY BLUMENFELD I

00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:43.047
REALLY WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU ON

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:45.282
THAT THE TIERED MIL FEE BUT DID

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:46.717
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ABOUT

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:48.719
THE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION. SIX

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.721
WHICH IS SIXTY MILLION ANNUALLY

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:51.822
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS ON THE

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:53.657
AGRICULTURAL BURNING AND WHAT

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:56.093
THIS MAY MEAN UP PROPOSALS FOR

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.995
THE AIR QUALITY IN THE- IN OUR

00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:00.831
AGRICULTURAL BASIS. WELL THEN

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:03.467
YEAH THANK SEVENTY ROSS AND I.

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:05.770
HAVE BEEN ACTING ON THIS ONE AS

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:10.441
WELLWITH THAT EVERY SOURCES.

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:12.009
BOARD- SAYS. RIGHT THIS I JUST

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.644
VERY THE REALLY WANT TO COME

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:16.080
AND- AGRICULTURAL IN THE

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:18.649
VALLEY- THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.718
IS AN ASH AND- IS IN SEVERE NON

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.119
ATTAINMENT OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:24.622
AIR ACT STANDARDS CHáVEZ I WAS

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.690
AND PARTICULAR MAD AT AND- IT'S

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.559
PARTICULARLY STUBBORN ISSUE

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.728
BECAUSE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY. OF

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:32.897
THE VALLEY- WHICH IS SIMILAR TO

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:35.099
THAT YOU KNOW A IN IN WAYS TO

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:37.401
THE TO THE LA BASIN BUT HAS A

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:38.969
LOT OF UNIQUE CHALLENGES SO.

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:40.404
OVER THE LAST DECADES

00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:43.107
AGRICULTURE. VOLUNTARILY IS

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:44.275
COME AND STEPPED UP TO THE

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.810
PLATE AND SAID HOW DO WE HELP

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.111
HOW TO EXPAND RESEARCH HOW DO

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:48.379
WE THINK ABOUT ADOPTING NEW

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:50.514
PRACTICES- THE FOLLOW PROGRAM

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:52.683
IS YOU KNOW. POSSIBLY FUNDED

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.418
THROUGH USDA WITH OTHER

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.187
PROGRAMS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE

00:40:56.253 --> 00:40:58.189
MOST SUCCESSFUL TRACTOR

00:40:58.255 --> 00:40:58.823
CONVERSION PROGRAMS PROBABLY IN

00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:00.758
THE WILD. AND THE FAMAS LOOKING

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:02.660
EVERY DAY AT WAYS OF THINKING

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:03.928
ABOUT. DIFFERENT FARMING

00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:06.263
PRACTICES THAT HELP REDUCE

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.298
EMISSIONS SO I JUST WANT TO

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:08.632
START BY THANKING THE

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:09.834
AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY FOR

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.735
THAT. AND THEN SECONDLY SAY IN

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:13.470
THIS PARTICULAR AREA AND THAT

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:18.108
ANY- WHICH IS. A LONG AND

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:19.476
COMPLEX ISSUE WITH THE AIR

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:21.378
RESOURCES BOARD I'VE GOT TO A

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:23.214
POINT WHERE DOES THE SCIENCE

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.249
WAS IN THAT WE NEED TO SET AN

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:27.585
END DATE FOR THAT- BUT WE

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:28.919
REALLY CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:31.155
PROVIDING MEANINGFUL. I'M

00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:33.824
FUNDING TO ALLOW PRACTICES THAT

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:34.925
EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.427
NEED TO HAPPEN IT JUST NEEDS TO

00:41:36.493 --> 00:41:38.195
HAPPEN IN A CONTROLLED MANNER-

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:40.297
ON THAT SONG SO THAT THE

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:42.199
EMISSIONS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:44.902
AIR POLLUTION AND SO. THIS THIS

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:48.505
IS- BEEN A AB EIGHT VERY- I

00:41:48.572 --> 00:41:49.773
THINK COLLABORATIVE PROCESS

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.178
WITH THE AGRICULTURE- THEY DO

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:56.547
NOT. ONE NECESSARILY IF YOU'RE

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:57.581
THERE IN THE ROOM THEY WOULD BE

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:59.350
LIKE WE LIVE LONGER BUT WE

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:00.484
UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE WE

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:02.253
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE RESOURCES

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:05.890
BOARD- HAS. EIGHT EIGHT DATE ON

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:15.566
ENDING AND BANNING AND IN THAT.

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:16.166
REMAINING THREE YEARS WE NEED

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:18.369
TO WORK. TO GET THAT TO THE TO

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.404
MAKE SURE THAT IS ISN'T. THAT

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:22.873
IS REALLY PART OF - AND-

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.375
HOWEVER. AROUND OUR OUR THAT.

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:25.409
TO A LOT OF THE WOULD WILL BE

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:27.611
DIFFICULT I'M AN EXAMPLE AND

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:30.014
CHAD IS. THAT KAREN IS MOST

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.248
FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE IS AN

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:33.117
INDUSTRY THAT SHE REPRESENTED

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:35.152
BUT IN THAT. IN THE TABLE GRAPE

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.721
AND WINE INDUSTRY- THE HOMAGE-

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:39.890
THAT'S BUILT OUT OF METAL AND

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:41.959
HAS WIDELY GOES THROUGH THE

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:44.328
VINES HARRY HOW YOU TAKE THAT

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.664
Y. ALEX- SO THAT IT CAN

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:49.967
PROBABLY BE. AND AND HOW YOU

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:52.236
MANAGE THOSE MATERIALS THESE

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:54.538
NEED TO ALSO BE TRANSFORMED AND

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:57.141
SO THERE'S A LOT OF- ON THE

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:58.842
VERY POSITIVE SIDE THAT RELATES

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:03.347
TO REGENERATIVE. AG AND WHAT

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:04.214
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THIS

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:06.116
IS A NEW TO BUY CHIPS STRINGS.

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:08.185
SO THAT DOZEN NEED TO KNOW BE.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:11.288
IT CAN BE CHIPPED- AND- PUT

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:13.090
BACK NTO THE SOIL I'M AS AN

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:15.192
AMENDMENT- TO HELP THAT OIL

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.694
HEALTH AND THAT COMMON IN THE

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.264
SOIL BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.532
FUNDING TO DO IT SAID THIS IS A-

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:22.333
THANK. YOU PROBABLY WON'T FIND

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:23.867
AN ISSUE THAT KAREN AND I FEEL

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:25.636
MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT. HOW THE

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:28.005
OTHER THAN IBM AND THIS ONE YET

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:29.306
ANYTHING ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:31.275
SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM- AND WE'RE

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:32.609
HAPPY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

PRETTY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT THAT

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:53.831
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND WE

00:43:53.897 --> 00:43:56.266
HAVE A PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.701
HOW THE SMALL AND MID SIZED

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.671
GROWERS ARE ABLE TO DO THIS-

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:01.972
INSTEAD SO THAT'S GOING TO TAKE

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:04.208
SOME TIME TAX. TO WORK WITH

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:06.477
THEM BUT THE INDUSTRY HAS AS

THEY ARE- THEY KNOW THAT THIS

MORE RECENT ONE OF A NEW

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:15.119
PRACTICE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:16.286

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.430
EQUIPMENT THAT CAN COME OUT AND

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:27.731
LITERALLY PULL OUT THE WHOLE

00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:29.833
TREE. AS WE KNOW. ALMOND

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.369
ORCHARDS LAST POSSIBLY TWENTY

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:32.936
FIVE YEARS AND THEN THEY ALL

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:34.738
HAVE TO BE REPLACED- IN THIS

00:44:34.805 --> 00:44:36.407
PULLS THOSE TREES OUT AND THEN

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:38.442
DOES THE CHIPPING RIGHT THERE

HEALTHY CELLS PROGRAMS. AS AN

00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:52.723
EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR THE ALMOND

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.726
INDUSTRY BUT SMALL FARMERS WILL

00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:57.995
HAVE SMALLER AMOUNTS OF WOODY

00:44:58.062 --> 00:45:00.364
BIOMASS STAND. THERE WILL BE A

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:02.866
NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO GET.

00:45:02.933 --> 00:45:04.268

FARMS. AND IT'S REALLY NOT.

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:22.679
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS ON FARMS

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:26.683
ITS IT'S- MAYBE- THEY'VE BEEN

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.018
EDUCATED IN THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:29.820
ON THE GROUND AS MUCH AS MAYBE

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:31.088
THE SECRETARY AND SOME OTHERS

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:32.890
BUT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.224
THE CHALLENGES OF BEING ON A

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:38.662
FARM IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE ALL

00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:40.397
FIRST OF ALL NUMBER ONE I'M

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:42.166
JUST FOR EXAMPLE I'M DOING SOME

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:43.700
ORGANIC FARMING I JUST STARTED

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:45.669
THE PAPERWORK LAST YEAR TO FOR

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:47.905
THIS LAST WEEK TO- START DOING

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.673
ORGANIC FARMING BUT I DO NEED

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.376
THE TOOLS OF HERBICIDES I DON'T

00:46:52.442 --> 00:46:53.844
USE ANY PESTICIDES THANK GOD I

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:56.647
DON'T HAVE ANY BUG PROBLEMS- SO

00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:59.116
FAR I HAVEN'T HAD THOSE- BUT IN

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:01.952
MY DISTRICT I WILL SHARE WITH

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:03.887
YOU THAT. 95% OF THE-

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.722
STRAWBERRY PLANTS NOT TO BURY%

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:07.057
ITSELF BUT THE PLANT THE

00:47:07.124 --> 00:47:08.392
NURSERIES ARE IN MY DISTRICT

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:10.427
AND THEY GROW THE PLANT SO THAT

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:12.696
IN WATSONVILLE THEY CAN. GROW

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:15.365
THE VERY. FOREIGN BORN MEXICO

00:47:15.432 --> 00:47:18.268
OR SOMEPLACE ISN'T ALL OVER THE

00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:20.604
WORLD. AND THERE'S CERTAIN-

00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:23.373
FUMIGANTS AND DECIDES IN

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.075
HERBICIDES IT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:27.077
THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:29.313
FOR THESE PESTICIDES AND

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:31.148
HERBICIDES AND THEY USE THEM AS

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:33.250
MOST FARMERS THE FIRST POLICY

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.252
THAT'S A COST NUMBER ONE TO

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.787
APPLICATIVE TO YOU TO BY THE

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:38.055
CHEMICAL TO ALWAYS IN THE COST

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:40.490
TO IT AND SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:42.526
TRYING TO DRIVE OUR COST DOWN.

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.127
BECAUSE WE COMPETE IN A GLOBAL

00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:45.562
MARKET I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:48.699
THAT GETS MISSED IN CALIFORNIA

00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:49.299
WHAT IS THE WE COMPETE IN THE

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.601
GLOBAL MARKET. AS WE ALWAYS

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:52.502
TALK ABOUT WANTING TO BE THE

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:55.005
LEADERS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL-

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:57.207
SPACE AND WE ARE WE HAVE THE

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:59.943
SAFEST FOOD IN THE WORLD AND WE

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.179
PRODUCE. THE GREATEST VARIETY

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:03.947
OF COMMODITIES IN THE WORLD

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:06.049
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE DO A

00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:08.118
REALLY GOOD JOB AT IT BUT

00:48:08.185 --> 00:48:09.052
FARMERS HAVE TO STAY IN

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.722
BUSINESS. AND WHEN YOU TO STAY

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:12.456
IN BUSINESS MEANS THAT YOU'RE

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:14.324
COMPETING AGAINST. OTHER

00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:17.194
COUNTRIES MEXICO. IS A HUGE

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:18.629
COMPETITOR OF OURS WHEN IT

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:22.699
COMES TO. THE SALAD BOWL OR

00:48:22.766 --> 00:48:24.134
THOSE TYPES OF COMMODITIES

00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:26.069
STRAWBERRIES THINGS THAT WITH

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:27.971
FRESH FRESH PRODUCE AND THEY

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:29.406
DON'T HAVE THE SAME REGULATIONS

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:30.874
THAT WE HAVE NOR DID THEY HAVE

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.277
THE SAME LABOR LAWS OR THE I

00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:34.344
MEAN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:36.847
ON. SO IF WE WANT TO BE LEADERS

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:39.349
IN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE TO KEEP

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.218
THE FARMER ON THE GROUND. IF

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.119
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF BUSINESS

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:43.287
YOU HAVE DEFEATED YOUR PURPOSE

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:44.888
BECAUSE HE'S THEY'RE MOVING TO

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:47.257
OTHER COUNTRIES. WHICH THEY

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:49.326
STILL SELL THEIR PRODUCTS HERE.

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:50.994
BUT IT PUTS THE FARMER IN

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:53.063
CALIFORNIA AT A DISADVANTAGE SO

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.631
I JUST WANTED LATE I WANTED TO

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:56.566
SHARE SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:58.835
ARE. ARE DIFFICULT AS SOMEBODY

00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:00.904
WHO DOES IT EVERY DAY. I WAS ON

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:03.340
A TRACTOR SATURDAY WHEN. WHEN I

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:04.708
WAS WORKING ON ONE ACTUALLY

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.143
WHEN THE CHAIR CALLED ME TO

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:07.377
TALK TO ME ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:09.379
THINGS WE HAD IN THIS. COMING

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:11.081
UP IN THIS COMMITTEE. SOMEONE

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:13.750
SAY I SUPPORT AG COMMISSIONERS

00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:15.319
WE HAVETO CALL THEM BEFORE WE

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:17.220
APPLY AND LET THEM KNOW THAT

00:49:17.287 --> 00:49:19.256
WE'RE GONNA APPLY. PRODUCT TO

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:20.991
OUR FIELD SO THEY KNOW THAT

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.225
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WITH

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:25.295
THERE'S STANDARDS ON WIND. A.

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:28.031
N. ALL KINDS OF PROTOCOLS OF

00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:29.599
SAFETY FOR YOUR FOR YOUR

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:31.868
EMPLOYEES. WHEN YOU SPRAY IN

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:33.737
FACT I DON'T ALLOW ANY MY PLACE

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:35.005
OF WORK TO DO IT I DO IT

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:37.207
BECAUSE IT'S JUST A BETTER WAY

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:38.775
TO KEEPING. THEM SAFE. BECAUSE

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:40.944
OF THE REGULATIONS ARE. VERY

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:42.646
STRICT SO I WANT TO SAYI'M I'M

00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:44.348
A BIG PROPONENT OF THE AG

00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:46.383
COMMISSIONERS AND THE UC. I'VE

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.985
DONE MYSELF. PROJECTS ON MY

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:51.054
LAND WITH THE UC COOPERATIVE

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:53.824
EXTENSION TO. TRY TO FIGURE OUT

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:55.926
WAYS TO FARM IN A MORE.

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:58.862
EFFICIENT AND MORE- FRIENDLY

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:01.832
SAFE. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT SO I

00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:02.999
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE ONE

00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:05.202
AREA THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT AND

00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:06.336
I BELIEVE THAT I'VE SOME OF

00:50:06.403 --> 00:50:07.838
EVEN I DON'T HAVE A COLLEGE

00:50:07.904 --> 00:50:09.539
EDUCATION TO PROVE IT. I HAVE A

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:11.875
LIFETIME IN THE GENERATIONS OF

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:13.076
FAMILY ON THE SAME PIECE OF

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:15.278
LAND. MAKING IT GROW THINGS FOR

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:18.014
PEOPLE TO EAT. SO I WANT TO

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:19.916
JUST THAT'S THE PREFACE OF WHAT

00:50:19.983 --> 00:50:21.318
WAS IT THE MIL TAX I HAVE A

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:24.554
pI HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP COMMENTS

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:27.491
THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. IT'S

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:30.127
NOT ALWAYS. IT SEEMS TO ME AS A

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:33.296
LEGISLATOR THAT. YOU KNOW ONCE

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:34.731
SOMETHING GETS IN THE PIPELINE

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:36.333
THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY TO EVER

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.668
CHANGE IT WHEN IT WHEN IT. ONE

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:39.469
IS NOT WORKING RIGHT WE HAVE

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:40.470
SOME PROBLEMS WE'VE BEEN TO

TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:04.828
THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THIS YEAR THE

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.596
ENTIRE DEPARTMENT STAFFING THIS

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:09.766

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:37.127
MAY BE REASONABLE BUT THIS IS

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:39.029
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GROWTH WE

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:40.063

SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN AROUND

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:54.811
GOVERNMENT MAYBE TOO LONG TO

BIT OF A TOUR BUT- WE'RE

WORKING HARD ON THAT AS WELL. I

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:04.901
THINK YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL PART

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:05.835
OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:08.338

THE- WHAT MY ACTUALLY MY-

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:18.548
ASSEMBLY WOMAN DOLLY DID A TOUR

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.250
AND ASKED FOR SOMEBODY TO COME

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:22.552
FROM THE DEPARTMENT- UP TO

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:23.853
SISKIYOU AND- THEY WERE ABLE

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.922
TO. MEET THAT OBLIGATION SO I

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:26.990
JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:30.860
THAT- DURING OUR EQ HEARING I

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:33.596
MENTION IT TO SENATOR ALAN AND-

00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:36.433
IF THE CHEROKEE Q. WHO WHAT WAS

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:37.667
GOING TO GO AS WELL SO WE'RE

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.869
GONNA DO A TOUR- SOON AND I. I

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.871
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:43.973
SOMEBODY FROM THE AGENCY IS

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.177
ABLE TO GO AND SEE- WHAT'S

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:49.079
HAPPENING TO THE ENVIRONMENT-

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:50.880
MAINLY AND- SISKIYOU COUNTY

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:54.217
IT'S OUT OF CONTROL AND NOT

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:57.220
RIGHT. SO I THOUGHT. SO THE

00:55:57.287 --> 00:55:58.254
OTHER THING I WANTED TO TOUCH

00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:00.690
ON WAS THE BURN IF THAT'S OKAY

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:04.427
WE. WE MOVED INTO THAT IS IF WE

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:04.894
MAY. SO THOSE ARE NOT

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:08.364
FRUSTRATION MIND- SO AS MANY

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.666
LEGISLATORS KNOW THAT I'VE I'VE

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:12.168
WORKED ON BIOMASS FOR IT SEEMS

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:14.204
LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE- IT IS

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.072
COMPLICATED AND IT'S DIFFICULT

00:56:16.139 --> 00:56:18.341
AND- BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:19.709
MAINLY ON THE ON THE FOREST

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:23.813
FIRE PART BUT- WHEN WE DID. AB

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.380
EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH WAS A

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:26.583
TRAILER BILL SOMETIME AGO I'VE

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:28.585
WE ACTUALLY EXTENDED BIOMASS

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:30.987
CONTRACTS ARE OF FORCED THE

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:33.757
UTILITIES TO BUY ENERGY FOR

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:35.825
BIOMASS PLANTS IN THE IN THE E.

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:37.660
J. COMMUNITY CAME IN AND MANY

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.229
IN IN MANY INSTANCES AND

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:41.931
OPPOSED OUR LEGISLATION- AND

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:44.134
MAINLY IN THE VALLEY AND SO- WE

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:49.639
HAD A 60% HI HI HI. HI THE FUEL

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:51.841
HAZARD ZONES AND 40% COULD COME

00:56:51.908 --> 00:56:53.977
FROM ANYWHERE ELSE AND THAT GOT

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:55.311
CHANGED IN THE SENATE THAT TIME

00:56:55.378 --> 00:56:56.513
I WAS IN THIS ASSEMBLY BUT BUT

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:59.716
THE POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU TALK

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:00.817
ABOUT OPEN BURN. AND YOU TALK

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:04.220
ABOUT THE VALLEY THE BASIN AND

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.989
THERE ARE HUGE CHALLENGES AS-

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:08.258
WAS STATED EARLIER ABOUT JUST

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:09.192
THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE VALLEY

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:11.261
AND HOW. IT DOESN'T CARRY THOSE

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:12.629
EMISSIONS OUT SO IF YOU'RE

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:14.364
GONNA IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA IT IF

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.533
YOU'RE NOT GONNA OPEN BURN. IT

00:57:16.599 --> 00:57:18.835
IF YOU CAN BURN IN A CONTROLLED

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:20.603
ENVIRONMENT IT'S A LOT LESS-

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:24.174
CARBON IN AND POLLUTANTS. AND

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.310
BUT DURING THE LAST EIGHT YEARS

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:28.578
OF WRANGLING THE E. J.

COMMUNITY IN THE VALLEY HAS

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:34.184
OPPOSED. USING BIOMASS PLANTS

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.718

00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:37.787
IS NO PLACE NOW FOR THE FARMER

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:41.424
TO TAKE THAT ALMOND TREE- OR IN

00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:42.258
THE SMALL FARMERS IN THE BIG

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:44.194
FARMERS FARMERS THE I HEARD THE

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.729
SECRETARY ROSS TALK ABOUT DOING

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:49.465
SOME. YOU KNOW- MULCHING IN

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:51.534
PUTTING THAT BACK IN THE SO AS

A FARMER I WANT TO SHARE WITH

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:54.904
YOU- SOME OF THE PROCESSES THAT

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:56.573
YOU'RE NOT SURE ON THE GROUND

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:58.641
AND SEE YES YOU CAN. YOU CAN

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:00.643
TAKE THE BIOMASS AND PUT IT

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:01.778
BACK IN THE GROUND IN A BUILDER

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:03.947
SO WE ALL KNOW THAT I DO I USE

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:06.716
BIO CHAR MY OWN FARMS IS AS A-

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:09.819
AS A- A SOIL. ADDITIVE THAT IS

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:12.922
VERY HELPFUL IN THIS AND STORES

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.457
CARBON AT THE SAME TIME. BUT

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:15.959
THE PROCESS IS THAT ACTUALLY A

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:16.926
TAP ON THE GROUND ARE VERY

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:18.328
DIFFICULT AND NOT EASY TO DO

00:58:18.394 --> 00:58:20.029
AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S FUNDING

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:22.065
FOR SOME OF THOSE. PROJECTS IN

00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:24.367
INTO QUITE FRANKLY IN SOME IN

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:25.935
JUST LET PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.136
BUT I DON'T WANT I WILL I GET

00:58:27.203 --> 00:58:28.104
IS THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:30.073
THAT. YOU CAN'T FORCE EVERYBODY

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:31.841
IN THE SAME BOX OR HAS TO BE

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:34.143
MORE THAN ONE TOOL. TO GET

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:35.278
WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND IF WE

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:37.080
DON'T HAVE BIOMASS PLANTS THAT

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:40.416
BURN. YES THEY BURN AND THEY

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:42.118
AND THEY BECAUSE EMISSIONS BUT

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.720
THE MISSIONS ARE SO MUCH LESS

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:45.822
THAN AN OPEN BURN. AND WHEN

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:47.790
THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION THAT'S

00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:49.158
A BETTER OPTION THAN AN OPEN

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:51.961
BURN OPTION AND SO- I JUST WANT

00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:54.197
TO TIE THAT IN TO. TO THE

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:56.733
SUSTAINABLE FARMING MEANS THAT

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:57.567
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET EVERY

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:59.369
THERE'S NOT EVERY SINGLE FARM

00:58:59.435 --> 00:58:59.869
IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:01.271
INCORPORATE ALL THESE TREES

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:02.872
BACK INTO THEIR FARM IT JUST IT

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:04.707
TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THAT. TO

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:06.209
BREAK DOWN AND ACTUALLY BECOME

00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:08.411
ORGANIC MATERIAL THAT'S GOING

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:08.978
TO BE USABLE AND STORE THAT

00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:11.247
CARBON. AND SO I JUST WANT TO

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:12.982
SHARE THAT THAT WE YOU KNOW. IN

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.217
SACRAMENTO WE TALK ABOUT

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:15.618
FARMING AND WHEN YOU GET ON THE

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:16.185
FARM IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT.

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.854
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME.

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:19.289
AND I WANTED TO TIE THAT BACK

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:21.491
TO MY- OPENING COMMENTS ABOUT.

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:22.659
IF WE DON'T HAVE CALIFORNIA

00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:25.495
FARMERS HERE. YOU KNOW. I CAN'T

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:27.497

EASEMENT ON THEIR LAND AND

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:35.171

INCREMENTALLY AND IT'S VERY

00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:50.086
DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPETE. SO

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:51.220
THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS MISTER

BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.233

THESE EMBLEMATIC. OP ARE

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:01.657
MERGING SEA PRODUCTIVE FUEL

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:04.259
BREAKS AND ACROSS LANDSCAPES WE

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.461
USED TO CALL US FOREST

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:05.961
MANAGEMENT BUT THAT'S A

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:07.463
MISNOMER THIS IS LAY.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:08.931
MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZING THAT

THAT'S- OR- OAK WOODLAND ARE

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:23.312
KIND OF FOR. THIS BUDGET FOR

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:24.747
THE FOR TIME- REAL CONSCIOUSLY

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:26.815
AVOID A ONE FITS ALSO FROM SAN.

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:28.183

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:34.757
REALLY PROUD THAT OUR BUDGET IN

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.792
IN THE DEBATE OF REGIONAL

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:39.395
PRIORITIES- THAT WILL FOCUS

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:41.230
MOST IMPORTANTLY ON PROTECTING

MORE RURAL AREAS TO ACTUALLY DO

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:20.936
MORE OF THIS WORK AND THEN

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.504
CRITICALLY REGULATORY

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.306
EFFICIENCY FRANKLY HISTORICALLY

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.108

FOR ST- MAINLY ON THEIR PRIVATE

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.853
LANDS- SO CAN THAT CANNOT BE

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.121
ADDRESSED IS THAT COUNTED IN

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:09.123
THE EQUATION OR NOT BECAUSE IF

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:10.291
IT IS A WE NEED TO. MAKE SURE

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.159
THAT WE'RE- DOING ACCOUNTING TO

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:13.928
MAKE SURE HOW MUCH MONEY IS

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:16.230
BEING SPENT WHERE- AND I THINK

01:32:16.297 --> 01:32:17.665
IT'S JUST DUE TO THE PUBLIC

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:19.267
NEEDS TO KNOW. HOW MUCH WE'RE

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.168
ACTUALLY TREATING. OVER AND

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:25.373
ABOVE. WHAT. IT WOULD NORMALLY

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:26.007
BE TREATED UNDER T. H. P. YEAH

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:28.009
SO OUR HIGH IN JUST CAN FILL IN

01:32:28.075 --> 01:32:30.278
AND- CORRECT BUT- SHORT OF IT

01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:31.712
IS THAT YEAH COMMERCIAL

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.881
ACTIVITY THAT'S- YOU KNOW BASED

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:35.182
ON ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:37.919
THAT. IN THE FORRESTER ON

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:40.354
LANDSCAPES DOES COUNT FOR.

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:40.922
WORKFORCE OR LANDSCAPE

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:43.024
MANAGEMENT- AND WE THINK THAT'S

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:44.358
IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE SAID

01:32:44.425 --> 01:32:46.093
YOU KNOW TAXPAYER FUNDED-

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.962
INVESTMENTS ARE ARE ONE

01:32:48.029 --> 01:32:49.931
IMPORTANT SOURCE OF LANDSCAPE

01:32:49.997 --> 01:32:50.898
MANAGEMENT BUT MARSHALL

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:54.302
ACTIVITY. IS AS WELL. SO TODAY

01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:56.270
THAT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:58.706
ACREAGE THAT WE FIND. AND I

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:02.343
THINK WE COULD RECOGNIZE OUR

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:05.813
THAT SECTOR IN ACTUALLY HELPING

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.949
BUILD OUR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE-

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:09.450
SO DIRECTLY INTO YOUR QUESTION

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:11.919
I BELIEVE IT IS. JESSICA IN OUT

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:14.288
OF THERE. HE MIGHT A LITTLE

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:16.657
HISTORY- AND WHERE THE FIVE

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:17.491
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE NUMBER

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:18.859
COMES FROM THAT COMES FROM THE

01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:20.895
FOREST CARBON PLANTS. AND SO

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:21.696
THE WHICH WAS A COLLABORATIVE

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:24.765
REPORT DONE BY SCIENTISTS AND-

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:27.568
AND EXPERTS. AYE IDENTIFYING

01:33:27.635 --> 01:33:28.869
WHAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:30.705
CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF LAND

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:32.907
OWNERSHIP WORST RECEIVED IS A

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:33.941
HEALTHY FOREST YOU THE

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:35.242
ESTIMATED THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:36.978
MILLION ACRES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:39.680
THAT ARE IN NEED AT THAT. OUT

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:40.815
OF THE THIRTY MILLION ACRES OF

01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:42.917
FOREST LAND IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:43.784
FIFTEEN MILLION ACRES WERE

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:47.188
NEEDED INTERVENTION. AND AND SO

01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:49.724
THE BASS LINE IN THAT TARGET A

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:50.491
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES.

01:33:50.558 --> 01:33:54.929
ASSUMES IT BUILDS INTO IT ABOUT

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:55.463
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE

01:33:55.529 --> 01:33:56.630
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES- OF

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:59.200
PRIVATE. WE IT TREATED

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:01.335
LANDSCAPES- INCLUDING TIMBER

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:03.838
HARVEST. I AND I AND THEN THE

01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:06.340
REMAINDER IS ON THE STATE AND

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:07.775
WE'VE SEEN THE STATE PORTION

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.343
AND- REALLY INCREASED

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:11.278
DRAMATICALLY- AND THIS BUDGET

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:13.047
WILL HELP US. REALLY DELIVER

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:14.515
THOSE TARGETS PART OF THE

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:16.517
REASON YOU HAVE. BOTH TIMBER

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:18.386
HARVEST AND VEGETATION

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:20.121
TREATMENT WITH AND IDENTIFIED

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:21.389
BY THAT TARGET IN THE FOREST

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:28.929
CARBON PLANT IS BECAUSE. THAT'S

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:29.530
HOW THE FOR SERVICE DOES THEIR

01:34:29.597 --> 01:34:30.865
ACCOUNTING AS WELL- SO IT'S IT

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:33.000
HELPS KEEP PARITY. UNDER AND

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:34.035
COMPARE. WHAT GETTING TREATED

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:36.037
AT WHERE- AND SO I CAN DO TO

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:37.204
CHEAT ORDER TO MAY HAVE.

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:38.906
ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS ON THIS

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:40.841
BEING OUR STATE FORESTER CAN BE

01:34:40.908 --> 01:34:44.078
ABLE TO OFFER SOME INSIGHTS

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:46.347
INTO HOW THIS ALL WORKS. CHIEF

QUESTION WHAT I THE ONLY THING

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:55.556
THAT I WANTED TO ADD IS THAT.

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:57.691
COMMERCIAL TIMBER OPERATIONS ON

01:34:57.758 --> 01:35:00.461
PRIVATE LAND ARE NOT FUNDED IN

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.129
ANY WAY BY ANY OF THESE

01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:04.031
DOLLARS. THAT IS WHOLLY

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:07.001
SEPARATE HOWEVER AS US

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:08.803
SECRETARY CHROMEBOOK MENTIONED

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:10.938
THEY ARE APPROPRIATELY

01:35:11.005 --> 01:35:12.773
ACCOUNTED FOR AS PLAN

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.276
MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY AND TO THE

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:17.044
FORCE PRACTICE RULES UNDER THE

01:35:17.111 --> 01:35:18.145
BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE

01:35:18.212 --> 01:35:20.915
PROTECTION AND- REGULATED BY

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:25.086
US- AS THE INSPECTION AGENCY-

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:27.221
WE DO INSURE THAT THOSE FOREST

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:28.589
MANAGEMENT PLAN I MEAN THE

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:31.592
TIMBER HARVEST PLANS MEET- THE

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:33.761
FUEL REDUCTION. COMPONENT FOR

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:35.629
THE AREA THAT THERE AND SO

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:38.032
IT'S- AND ALL A MULTI PRONGED

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:40.334
APPROACH BUT THAT IS WHERE

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:43.537
PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND PRIVATE-

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.506
ECONOMICS ARE ACTUALLY DRIVING

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.775
SOME OF THE GOOD WORK IN THE

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:49.743
FUEL REDUCTION AND FOREST

01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:52.012
RESILIENCE. SPACE I THANK YOU

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.881
FOR THOSE THE QUESTION THAT'S

01:35:53.948 --> 01:35:54.882
IT'S I THINK IT'S A PROPERTIES%

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:56.016
WELL I'M NOT I'M NOT

01:35:56.083 --> 01:36:00.454
DISAGREEING WITH YOU BUT I. DO

01:36:00.521 --> 01:36:02.323
WANT TO SAY THAT. WE TALK ABOUT.

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:03.190
THE ROOM THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:04.492
THAT'S BEING SPENT IF YOU'RE

01:36:04.558 --> 01:36:06.093
COUNTING IF YOU CAN'T PUT IT

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.529
ALL IN ONE POT THE ACREAGES IN

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:11.132
ONE POT I SHOULD SAY. AND HALF

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:13.134
OF THAT OR THREE THOUSAND ACRES

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.702
THAT IS BEEN TREATED BY THE

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:16.871
PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH IS GOOD.

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:18.873
WE NEED TO DO THAT. AND THEN

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:20.074
YOU LOOK AT THE SIDE THAT THE

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:22.243
PUBLIC SECTOR ACTUALLY SPENT

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:22.810
MONEY ON WHICH WE'RE TALKING

01:36:22.877 --> 01:36:25.212
ABOUT HERE. THE COST PER ACRE

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:26.280
GOES WAY UP BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:28.449
PAY ANYTHING FOR THE THREE

01:36:28.516 --> 01:36:29.750
HUNDRED THOUSAND. MY GOAL IS

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:31.218
BUT- I'M NOT OPPOSED TO

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.286
SPENDING THE MONEY I WILL I

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:33.454
THINK PRIVATE PEOPLE SHOULD BE

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:34.121
DOING I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:35.422
HELPING OUT I THINK WE SHOULD

01:36:35.489 --> 01:36:36.390
BE AND WE ARE. THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:37.992
IS ABOUT. BUT WE NEED TO CATCH

01:36:38.058 --> 01:36:40.094
ACT WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT

01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:41.629
THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS OUT

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:43.797
THERE. AND I THINK TO A MAN I

01:36:43.864 --> 01:36:45.366
KNOW THE PRIVATE SIDE.

01:36:45.432 --> 01:36:46.400
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A PRODUCT

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:47.968
THAT COMES OUT OF THE- IN IN

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:49.870
MANY CASES NOT NOT IN SENATORS

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:50.938
TURNS DISTRICT WHERE YOU HAVE

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:53.073
CHAPARRAL AND THAT'S A 100%

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.609
COST AND- AND I THINK. MISS

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:57.444
MORRIS. STATED IT PERFECTLY

01:36:57.511 --> 01:36:59.313
THAT SOME ACRES ARE REALLY HIGH

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:01.949
TO. TREAT AND SUMMER LOW- AND

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:02.983
SO IT BUT THE BALANCE IS BUT

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.451
WE- BUT ONE MORE COUNTY DOING

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:06.687
ACCOUNTING. WE NEEDED DIVIDE

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:08.489
OUT WHAT IT'S REALLY COSTS AND

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:11.192
FOR THE PUBLIC- BECAUSE- A FEW

01:37:11.258 --> 01:37:12.760
YEARS AGO WE PASSED. A PIECE OF

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:14.528
LEGISLATION HERE THAT ALLOWED.

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:16.330
CAL FIRE TO HELP. PRIVATE

01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:19.767
LANDOWNERS. DO CONTROLLED BURNS.

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:21.535
AND SO LAST FALL ACTUALLY WENT

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:23.771
IN TO THE LOCAL CAL FIRE-

01:37:23.837 --> 01:37:26.574
OFFICE AND IN BEAVER. AND I'VE

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.209
WANTED TO DO WANTED TO BURN

01:37:28.275 --> 01:37:29.977
BECAUSE WE HAD A WINDOW AND

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:31.245
THAT YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:32.479
PAPERWORK THAT I HAD TO GO

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:33.547
THROUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO A

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:35.482
BURN. IN THE TIME FRAME THAT I

01:37:35.549 --> 01:37:38.052
NEEDED TO DO IT AS HORRENDOUS

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:40.054
FOR A SMALL. THE LANDOWNER AS

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.023
MYSELF AND SO WHAT WHY SAY THAT

01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:44.358
IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:46.427
ABILITY BE ABLE TO HELP THE-

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:47.461
THE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WHO

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:49.597
DON'T HAVE A COMMODITY. THAT

01:37:49.663 --> 01:37:51.232
ACTUALLY OFFSET THE COST AND WE

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:52.099
NEED TO BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:54.034
THE REGULATORY PROCESSES FOR

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:55.903
THOSE LANDOWNERS THEY CAN'T

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:57.004
THAT THAT ARE TRYING TO DO A T.

01:37:57.071 --> 01:37:58.472
H. P. TO DO THE GOOD WORK THAT

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:00.708
THEY NEED TO DO- AND THOSE ARE

01:38:00.774 --> 01:38:01.909
THOSE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US

01:38:01.976 --> 01:38:03.210
TO DRIVE THE COST DOWN AND

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:05.279
TREAT MORE ACRES. SO I JUST

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:07.081
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THAT

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:08.549
THE LEGISLATURE ACTION OR

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:10.718
STANDS WHAT OF WHAT OCCURS WERE

01:38:10.784 --> 01:38:11.719
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IF YOU

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:16.056
THROW MON OF THE SAME POT. SOME

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:16.657
OF THOSE ACRES THE TAXPAYER.

01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:17.758
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:18.926
TREAT THOSE ACRES AND SOME

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:20.728
MAKERS THEY DID AND AMOUNTS AND

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:23.731
THE COST. IS HUGE IT'S A IT'S A

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:26.066
HIGH DOLLAR COMPARED TO WHAT-

01:38:26.133 --> 01:38:27.334
IT HAPPENED ON THE PRIVATE SIDE

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:28.102
SO I JUST WANT TO DRAW THAT

01:38:28.168 --> 01:38:30.237
DISTINCTION I WANTED TO ADD ONE

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:31.005
MORE THING MISTER JOURNAL BE

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:33.907
QUIET- ON THE TRANSPORTATION I

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:35.409
KNOW THAT THE CHAIR. REACHED

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:37.645
OUT TO ME ABOUT THAT THE

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:38.679
HELPING THE TRANSFERRED THE

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:40.347
BIOMASS TRANSPORTATION AND I

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:41.682
JUST WANT TO I THINK IT'S A

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:43.417
GOOD IDEA I THINK WE'VE DONE

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:44.685
THIS IN THE PAST WE'VE TRIED TO

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:48.656
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO. TO- HELP.

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:49.757
THE TRANSPORTATION COST OF

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:51.859
BIOMASS WE CAN ACTUALLY GET IT

01:38:51.925 --> 01:38:54.628
TO A- RENEWABLE SOURCE- BUT HOW

01:38:54.695 --> 01:38:56.430
IT WORKS NEEDS TO BE. THE

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:58.332
DETAILS OF HOW THAT WORKS-

01:38:58.399 --> 01:39:00.134
THERE WAS. BECAUSE I'M IN THE

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.935
FORESTED AREAS AND I KNOW. THE

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:03.170
CONTRACTORS IN THE PEOPLE THAT

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:04.905
USE THESE PROGRAMS. THAT THE

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:07.241
SYSTEM WAS GAINED AND I DON'T

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:08.042
WANT THAT I WANT MORE ACRES

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:10.978
TREATED. IS THE GOAL IF THE

01:39:11.045 --> 01:39:12.012
PUBLIC IS GONNA BE PUTTING

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.213
RESOURCES IN IT I DON'T WANT

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.748
THEIR ABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:17.351
BE. THAT IT. TO BE GAINED AND

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:17.885
IT WAS SO LET ME GIVE AN

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:20.587
EXAMPLE. IF YOU'RE GONNA GIVE.

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:22.423
FIRST OF ALL IN DIVORCE AFTER

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.091
WEEK TALK IN BONE DRY TIMES WE

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:25.426
DON'T TALK AND GREEN TOWN SO

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:27.094
WHEN YOU HALL IN A LOAD TO A

01:39:27.161 --> 01:39:30.130
BIOMASS FACILITY. IT'S GOT SO

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:31.465
MUCH MOISTURE IN IT THAN A LOT

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:33.467
OF THAT IS THEY THEY DRY IT AND

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:35.502
THEY- FIGURE OUT. HOW MUCH THE

01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:37.304
WAY IT IS IN A BONE DRY TIME SO

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:38.572
WE SHOULD BE TALKING IN BONE

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.507
DRY TIMES NUMBER ONE. AND THE

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:41.875
SUBSIDY SHOULD BE BASED ON

01:39:41.942 --> 01:39:43.944
MILES AWAY FROM THE PLANT. THE

01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:45.713
CLOSEST PLANT. BECAUSE WHAT

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:49.049
HAPPENS IS. CONTRACTORS FOR THE

01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:51.952
PLANTS. GET THE SUBSIDY. AND

01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:54.054
THERE ARE HAULING IT RIGHT BY

01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:54.788
ONE PLAN TO GO TO ANOTHER PLANT

01:39:54.855 --> 01:39:56.757
THAT'S FURTHER. WHICH MAKES IT

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:58.092
WHICH DOESN'T DO THE PUBLIC ANY

01:39:58.158 --> 01:40:00.060
GOOD WORK TRYING TO GET BIOMASS

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.762
TO THE PLANT. THE CLOSEST

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:02.830
PLANTS WE CAN TREAT MORE ACRES

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:05.132
WITH THAT. WITHOUT SUBSIDY SO I

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:07.601
WOULD BE HAPPY TO- HELP PUT

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:08.869
LANGUAGE IN THERE AT SOME POINT

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:10.604
THAT EXPLAINS LIKE A IT WAS

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:12.873
OVER THIRTY MILES IT'S- SO MANY

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.308
DOLLARS A BONE DRY TIENEN NEED

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:15.342
TO GO TO THE PLANT AND THEY

01:40:15.409 --> 01:40:17.244
NEED TO BE THE ONES THAT. ARE

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:19.613
REQUIRED TO REPORT BACK. TO THE

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.081
LEGISLATURE ON HOW THAT LOOKS

01:40:21.148 --> 01:40:22.015

THE CONVERSATION FORWARD HERE I

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:29.276
WAS HOPING WHILE WE HAD THE

01:42:29.343 --> 01:42:31.044
BENEFIT OF L. A. L. HERE WE GET

01:42:31.111 --> 01:42:32.112
A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORICAL

01:42:32.179 --> 01:42:37.017
CONTEXT FOR WHY I'VE HAD. I'VE

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:39.186
BEEN A BIT OF A- I HAVE- I

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:40.721
WOULD NOT SENATE REQUIRES A BIT

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:44.725
CRUNCHY OVERALL. FEW YEARS ON-

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:48.328
ON ON SOME OF THE FUNDING.

01:42:48.395 --> 01:42:50.898
CYCLES AND HOW IT'S- REDID

01:42:50.964 --> 01:42:53.634
DIFFERENT FIRE RISK ZONES- SO I

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.002
DON'T KNOW IF ELIO IS STILL

01:42:55.068 --> 01:42:57.371
ONLINE BUT- ONE OF DISTRICT I

01:42:57.437 --> 01:42:59.273
TWO TOPPINGS ON TOUCH SAID THE

01:42:59.339 --> 01:43:01.041
SORT OF FORCED HEALTH SPACE

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:02.910
WRIT LARGE. AND THEN THE

01:43:02.976 --> 01:43:06.280
HARDENING SPACE- SO

01:43:06.346 --> 01:43:08.715
HISTORICALLY LMAO HAVE YOU GUYS

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:11.418
ANALYZED- SO IT'S A ON FOREST

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.687
HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION WHAT

01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:16.857
THE- THE REGIONAL BREAKDOWN HAS

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:19.626
BEEN FOR FUNDING HISTORICALLY.

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:22.062
MISTER SINISTER BROWN. YEAH I

01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:24.665
CAN- JUMPING ELEVEN NINETY MY

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:27.100
COLLEAGUE CAN ADD- ACTIVATED

01:43:27.167 --> 01:43:28.368
SMOKE THINK HE'S LOOK AT THAT

01:43:28.435 --> 01:43:29.736
BUT I THINK OUR UNDERSTANDING

01:43:29.803 --> 01:43:32.105
IS THAT HISTORICALLY THAN DAY

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:34.141
NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE HAS

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:37.277
HAS OFTEN HAD- MAYBE- HAD MORE

01:43:37.344 --> 01:43:38.545
THE FINDING IN SOME OF THESE

01:43:38.612 --> 01:43:40.380
AREAS THEN AND THEN THE SOUTH

01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:41.214
AND IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:42.349
STATE THERE'S MORE STUDENTS

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:44.017
THAT TRADITIONAL FOREST PLANTED

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.752
SOME OF THE POOREST HEALTH.

01:43:45.819 --> 01:43:47.688
FUNDS HAVE GONE I THINK- MORE

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:49.156
TO THAT AREA BUT MY COLLEAGUE I

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:53.493
BRAIN BROWN THE ALSO HAVE. HAVE

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.028
SOME WORDS TO ADD AS WELL.

01:43:55.095 --> 01:43:56.296
THANK YOU SENATOR STERN- RYAN

01:43:56.363 --> 01:43:57.998
BROWN WITH THE L. A. L. JUST A

01:43:58.065 --> 01:43:59.766
LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THAT.

01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:01.535
MS CHRISTINE POINT WE DID LOOK

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:03.203
PARTICULARLY AT THE-

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:04.838
CALIFORNIA- IS A FIRE

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:06.173
PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM AS

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:06.940
WELL AS THE FORCE HEALTH

01:44:07.007 --> 01:44:09.443
PROGRAM. IN BOTH CASES WHAT WE

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:11.612
LOOK AT WAYS. FOR ALL THE GRANT

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:12.913
PROVIDED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:16.450
YEARS THROUGH GPRS FINDING.

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:18.118
VERY LARGE SHARE THE FUNDING

01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:20.020
AND I CAN PULL UP THE NUMBERS

01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:21.421
OF THE COMMITTEES INTERESTED.

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:22.723
I'M SURE OF IT WENT TO USE

01:44:22.789 --> 01:44:23.757
CERTAIN REGION OF THE STATE

01:44:23.824 --> 01:44:25.859
PREDOMINANTLY THE SIERRA NEVADA

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:28.295
REGIONS. NORTH COAST IN

01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:31.231
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN A MUCH

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:32.766
SMALLER SHARE OF A WIN TO.

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:35.636
SOUTH OF THE TO HELP TAXIS- WE

01:44:35.702 --> 01:44:36.536
HAD SOME SUBSEQUENT

01:44:36.603 --> 01:44:37.971
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:39.940
DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:40.607
RESOURCES AGENCY THEY CAN

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:42.743
PROBABLY SPEAK. MORE TO IT I

01:44:42.809 --> 01:44:43.377
THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY SEVERAL

01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:44.911
FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:47.080
OVER TIME- THEY REPORTED FOR

01:44:47.147 --> 01:44:49.082
EXAMPLE THAT THEY RECEIVE

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:50.984
RELATIVELY FEWER APPLICATION

01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:51.852
FROM SOME OF THOSE SOUTHERN

01:44:51.918 --> 01:44:53.654
CALIFORNIA REGION THAT COULD BE

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.521
DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THAT WE

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:55.622
HAVEN'T EXPLORED THAT AND TOO

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:58.492
MUCH THAT THE AT- AND- IT MAY

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:00.327
ALSO HAVE SOME. SOMETHING TO DO

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:02.663
WITH SOME OF THAT FACTORS THAT-

01:45:02.729 --> 01:45:04.264
SUPPORTIVE PROGRAMS SOME OF THE

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:05.465
CRITERIA THAT ARE USED TO

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:07.801
EVALUATE PROJECTS SO- YOU KNOW

01:45:07.868 --> 01:45:08.869
BECAUSE THOSE ARE GIGI R. F.

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:10.937
FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE. FOCUSED IN

01:45:11.004 --> 01:45:13.240
PARTICULAR ON- IT WILL RELEASE

01:45:13.306 --> 01:45:14.641
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:16.243
EVALUATING THOSE PROGRAMS AND

01:45:16.309 --> 01:45:19.212
IN GRANT APPLICATIONS IS THE-

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:21.481
THE CARBON BENEFITS AND THERE

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:22.115
MAY BE CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:45:22.182 --> 01:45:23.383
PROJECTS. ARE THERE MORE

01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:25.719
PREDOMINATELY IN SOME OF THOSE

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:27.621
ARE LARGER TREE FOR CITY AREAS

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:32.459
THAT- SCORE BETTER ON ON SOME

01:45:32.526 --> 01:45:33.060
OF THOSE CRITERIA. THANK YOU

I'VE HEARD I'VE HEARD NOTHING

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:43.637
BUT WILLINGNESS AND- CREATIVITY

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:46.273
ON THEIR PART TO TRY TO. SOLVE

01:45:46.339 --> 01:45:49.409
THAT- THE HISTORIC INEQUITY

01:45:49.476 --> 01:45:53.880
JUST. THE NUMBERS 3% OF TOTAL

GOVERNOR BUT THE STATISTICS

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:25.644

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:52.304
AGO WE DIDN'T SEE THE DEATH THE

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:53.472

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.315
RESPONDING TO FIRES. YOU KNOW

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:04.850
THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:15.728
ONE LAST POINT AFTER THIS IS

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:19.231

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:34.720
FIRST OF ALL FORMER FUNDING THE

02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:44.830
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MONEY FOR

02:11:44.896 --> 02:11:46.565
AG BURN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:48.467
OF TWO NOTED THAT THE ONLY

02:11:48.533 --> 02:11:49.468
REASON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT

02:11:49.534 --> 02:11:51.603
ISSUE HERE TODAY IN THIS BUDGET

02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:52.571
SUBCOMMITTEE IS BECAUSE THE

AIRPORT REJECTED THE PROPOSAL

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.941
FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN AIR

02:11:56.008 --> 02:11:58.143
DISTRICT FOR THEIR REDUCTION IN

02:11:58.210 --> 02:12:00.312
AG BURN ANY MONEY FOR THIS

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:01.713
ISSUE NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.782
THE SAN JOAQUIN AIR DISTRICT

02:12:03.849 --> 02:12:05.117
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS

02:12:05.183 --> 02:12:06.251
IS COMING FROM AND IF WE MAKE

02:12:06.318 --> 02:12:07.753
THIS OPENED ALL AIR DISTRICT

02:12:07.819 --> 02:12:08.920
ONLY GONNA SLOW DOWN THAT

02:12:08.987 --> 02:12:10.422
PROCESS AND REALLY MAKE IT

02:12:10.489 --> 02:12:11.390
UNATTAINABLE FOR THE SAME

02:12:11.456 --> 02:12:12.557
WALKING A DISTRICT TO ACHIEVE

02:12:12.624 --> 02:12:14.559
THE GOALS SET OUT. ON METHANE

02:12:14.626 --> 02:12:16.895
DIGESTERS THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:17.529
IS THE REASON WHY WE'RE TALKING

02:12:17.596 --> 02:12:19.097
ABOUT METHANE DIGESTION THE

02:12:19.164 --> 02:12:20.899
REDUCTION OF METHANE IN DERRY

02:12:20.966 --> 02:12:23.669
IT DOES NOT HAVE A TECHNOLOGY

02:12:23.735 --> 02:12:25.337
PREFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:12:25.404 --> 02:12:26.905
REDUCTION OF METHANE WE BELIEVE

02:12:26.972 --> 02:12:28.140
THAT THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:12:28.206 --> 02:12:28.840
SHOULD BE SENT TO THE

02:12:28.907 --> 02:12:29.975
DEPARTMENT FOR THEM TO

02:12:30.042 --> 02:12:31.543
DETERMINE WHICH TECHNOLOGY IS

02:12:31.610 --> 02:12:33.578
BEST USED TO REDUCE METHANE

02:12:33.645 --> 02:12:35.380
EMISSIONS IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY

02:12:35.447 --> 02:12:37.316
AND THEN FINALLY. HOW ON THE

02:12:37.382 --> 02:12:38.150
DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:40.085
REGULATION WE DO SUPPORT THE

PET DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE

02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:42.587
REGULATION IT'S ABSOLUTELY

02:12:42.654 --> 02:12:44.589
ESSENTIAL IF STRUCTURAL DEFICIT

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:46.525
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE DO NOT

02:12:46.591 --> 02:12:47.826
SUPPORT A TILT CURED MIDDLE

02:12:47.893 --> 02:12:49.761
SEGMENT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

02:12:49.828 --> 02:12:51.263
IT'S BEEN JUSTIFIED AND THE

02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:52.497
BASIS FOR IT IS NOT WELL

02:12:52.564 --> 02:12:54.266
SUPPORTED WE ALSO DO NOT

02:12:54.333 --> 02:12:56.968

FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I

02:12:58.070 --> 02:13:00.138
BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:02.341
CREATE STAFF POSITIONS- AND

02:13:02.407 --> 02:13:03.809
IT'S GOING TO CREATE A BURDEN

02:13:03.875 --> 02:13:05.544
ON THE INDUSTRY. WE THINK IT'S
