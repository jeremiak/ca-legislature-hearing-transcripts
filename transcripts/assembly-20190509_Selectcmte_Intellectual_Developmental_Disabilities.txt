WE DON'T HOLD HEARINGS ON PENDING LEGISLATION. BUT LEGISLATION CAN HAPPEN WITH YOUR INPUT. THIS IS WHY SELECT COMMITTEES ARE DIFFERENT FROM POLICY COMMITTEES. WE'VE LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS HEARINGS THAT LISTEN TO YOUR STORIES IS THE MOST VALUABLE THING WE ARE GOING TO HEAR TONIGHT. LEGISLATION HAS OCCURRED BECAUSE OF YOUR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES. WITH THIS COMMITTEE. WE HAVE TO SET ASIDE SIDE AMPLE TIME AT THE END OF THE HEARING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT TO HEAR FROM YOU. SO WE DO HAVE A FULL AGENDA. I'M READY TO GO. SO LET'S GET THIS THING STARTED. WE WILL BEGIN WITH A BRIEF PRESENTATION FROM MS LARSON IN THE FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER AND SIR MAY MEASURE OF THE NORTH STATE OFFICE OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL. DISABILITIES AND THE FLOOR IS YOURS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER AND MISTER BRUCE ROSS THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS TIME TO MEET WITH THE FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER COMMUNITY THIS EVENING. WE ARE HUGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WE ENCOMPASS GREAT BEAUTY AND DEEP SOULS. YOU WELL KNOW THAT OUR REGION WAS DEEPLY IMPACTED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS BY THE HORROR AND DEVASTATION OF BOTH THE CAR FIRE. AND THE PARADISE CAMPFIRE. EIGHTY SIX PEOPLE DIED IN THE INFERNO OF PARADISE. MOST WERE ELDERLY AND PHYSICALLY DISABLED. FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER HAD. SEVEN HUNDRED CLIENTS LIVING IN PARADISE. WE DID NOT LOSE ONE FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER CLIENT. WHY I HAVE ASKED MYSELF WAS IT A MIRACLE? WELL IF YOU CALL THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS AMERICAL THEN YES. HOWEVER IT WAS ALSO COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. AND RURAL COMMUNITIES WE REACH OUT TO EACH OTHER WE REACH OUT TO OUR NEIGHBORS WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. NEIGHBORS SAVE IT NEIGHBORS. IT WAS ALSO LOVE. AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE HUNDREDS OF DIRECT CARE. PROFESSIONALS WHO TOOK PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO SAFETY. AND STAYED WITH THEM FOR WEEKS. AND HOTELS SHELTERS AND HOMES OF FRIENDS UNTIL FEMA ARRIVED. AND BEGAN DELIVERING THE TRAILERS WHICH THEY LET THEM. THEY STAYED FOR WEEKS WITHOUT A BREAK I'M TAKIN. SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. THESE PEOPLE HAD FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN. THEY LOST THEIR OWN HOMES AND YET THEY STAYED WITH THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM THEY SUPPORTED PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I MAKE THIS REQUEST ON BEHALF OF OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THAT YOU DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO INCREASE THE WAGES OF DIRECT CARE PROFESSIONALS AND LINE NO ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER YOU HAVE DOWN THAT YOU HAVE WORKED HARD TO DO THAT. THEY ARE WORTH MORE THAN THE MINIMUM. THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR WORTH AND THEY'RE WORTH IS PRICELESS IN MY PERSONAL OPINION. THEY DESERVE A LIVING WAGE. THE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICE SYSTEM DEPENDS ON OUR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH ARE STRONG PEOPLE PROUD PEOPLE THEY DON'T ASK FOR THINGS THEY DO NOT NEED. REGIONAL CENTERS NEED FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE MODEST REQUESTS WE RECEIVE. BECAUSE OF OUR ISOLATION AND LOW PAPA POPULATION WE HAVE ALWAYS RELIED ON OURSELVES. WE LISTEN TO THE DREAMS AND HOPES OF OUR CLIENTS AND FAMILIES AND WE CREATE SOLUTIONS TOGETHER. WE SHARE A SAMPLING OF SOME OF OUR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS WITH YOU THIS EVENING. WE CREATE EMPLOYMENT WERE WE CAN INSTEAD OF OUTDATED DAY PROGRAMS WE CREATE MEANINGFUL AN INTERESTING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. WE ASK OUR CLIENTS HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF ABUSE AND EXPLOITATION. AND THEY HAVE PROVIDED US WITH THE ANSWERS AND WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THEIR IDEAS. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WROTE A LETTER ON MAY FIRST TO THE ASSEMBLY SUB BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- ONE ON HEALTH AND SERVICES ON THE BURNS RATE STUDY. TWO PARAGRAPHS ON PAGE SEVENTEEN CAUGHT MY EYE BECAUSE IT IT IT DOES NOT RELEVANT TO OUR AREA. CONSIDERING QUALITY AND INNOVATION IN SERVICE PROVISION I QUOTE. WE KNOW THAT THE RATE STUDY DOES NOT DISCUSS HOW INNOVATION IN SERVICE DELIVERY WILL BE SUPPORTED BY RATES OR HOW TO ADJUST AND USE RATE MODELS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMIZED SERVICES TO CONSUMERS. AND OF QUOTE. WE MUST HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO INNOVATE. EACH COMMUNITY AT EACH PERSON IS UNIQUE. HOPE THAT YOU ENJOY LISTENING TO THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE OF THE NORTH. I WANT US START BY AGAIN THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER AND MISTER BRUCE. ROSS -- FOR VISITING OUR COMMUNITY AND BEING HERE TONIGHT TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A LOT TO SAY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO HERE I AM I I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE THE MANAGER OF THE NORTH STATE OFFICE OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IS ESTABLISHED IN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THEIR FAMILIES GET THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THEY NEED. TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. WELL THE STATE COUNCIL IS REALLY A HAS AN INTERESTING STRUCTURE WE HAVE OUR HEADQUARTERS IN SACRAMENTO AND WE HAVE TWELVE REGIONAL OFFICES ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I KNOW YOU'RE GETTING TO KNOW SOME OF THEM. SO WHAT'S THE ROLE OF A REGIONAL OFFICE WELL IT'S TO ADVOCATE TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE SYSTEM HELP CONNECT PEOPLE TO SERVICES AND AND SUPPORTS. WE PROVIDE TRAINING INFORMATION. WE MONITOR LEGISLATION. AND WE IDENTIFY UNMET NEEDS IN THE SERVICE SYSTEM. SO IT GETS EVEN MORE INTERESTING HERE IS THAT EVERY FIVE YEARS. THE STATE COUNCIL IN COLLABORATION WITH THE WHOLE ENTIRE COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. OF HEARING FROM THE PEOPLE OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES WE GET INPUT TO DEVELOP A FIVE YEAR PLAN. AND THAT PLAN IDENTIFIES GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. THAT ARE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE SYSTEM [INAUDIBLE] SO. CURRENTLY WE HAVE SIX WE CALL ON FEDERAL AREAS OF EMPHASIS OR GOALS. AND THOSE ARE SELF ADVOCACY EMPLOYMENT [INAUDIBLE] HOUSING. HEALTH AND SAFETY [INAUDIBLE] EDUCATION. IN FORMAL AND INFORMAL COMMUNITY SPORTS. SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON EVERY DAY. TO TRY TO CHIP AWAY AND IMPROVE THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR SERVER SYSTEM ON BEHALF. OF THE FOLKS THAT WE REPRESENT. SO EVERY YEAR WHAT WE DO IS WE SAY WE NEED TO COME EVERY YEAR WE NEED TO CHECK IN WE NEED TO DO AN ASSESSMENT SAY. IS THIS WORKING ARE WE ARE WE MAKING A DIFFERENCE SO WHAT WE DO IS WE GATHER ALL THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THOSE COMMUNITIES AND FIND OUT EVERY YEAR. OF THAT FIVE YEAR PLAN. AND SAY WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS. AND WHAT ARE SOME ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS THOSE BARRIERS SO WHAT. IN OUR LAST ASSESSMENT IN OUR REGION IN OUR NINE COUNTY REGION AND WE FOUND THAT HOUSING EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH CARE. WHERE THE TOP UNMET NEEDS? AND SO I PROVIDED FOR YOU AND HOPEFULLY FOR EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE HERE -- I HAND OUT. THAT IS DE TELLY THAT INFORMATION. SO IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE HURDLE ALREADY FROM LAURA BUT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THE NORTH STATE HAS SURVIVED. THE OROVILLE DAM SPILL WAY EMERGENCY. THE CAR FIRE. IN THE RECENT CAMPFIRE AND I PERSONALLY LIVE IN THE CAMP FIRE SCARS ZONE AS THEY SAY. AND CONTINUE TO BE HUMBLED BY THE COURAGE AND STRENGTH OF OUR COMMUNITY. SO MANY PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES LOST EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE STAFF IN THE AGENCIES THAT LOST HOUSING. FACILITIES AND STAFF. I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH HOW HOW SO MANY PEOPLE. KEEP ON KEEPIN ON IN SPITE. DESPITE ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED. AND MANY OF THOSE HEROES ARE IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT. WE HOPE FOR POSITIVE RESULTS FROM THE RATE STUDY THAT THAT PROVIDES BETTER PAY FOR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. IT IS SO DESERVED. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO ARE LISTENING TO PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE ABOUT WHAT MATTERS TO PEOPLE AND HOW TO LIVE A GOOD LIFE. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY SHARING SOME INTERESTING FACTS. ABOUT THE NORTH STATE REGION. WE ALL KNOW THIS ONE NOW IT CONSISTS OF NINE COUNTIES. IT'S OVER THREE THIRTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES.

AND OVER EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE SERVED BY FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER ALL YEAH WE'RE ONE OF THE FEW REGIONAL OFFICES OF THE STATE COUNCIL THAT WORKS WITH ONLY ONE AND THE BEST. REGIONAL CENTER.

TO REMOVE FOR NEXT PANEL THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AGAIN GRADS. RIGHT. TO GRADUATE THE CHANCE. TONGUE TIED. SO WE'RE GONNA GO BACK -- TO AND THINK OUR COLLEGE PLUS STUDENTS -- BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT RESPITE FOR CHILDREN AGES SIX ZERO THREE FROM ROBIN LARCENY TAKES A VISOR IT FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING AND I AGREE WITH TAMMY THOSE ARE REALLY HARD ACTS TO FOLLOW. I'M ROBIN LARSON I'VE WORKED AT FOR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER FOR THIRTY YEARS AND BEEN IN THE FIELD OF DEVELOPMENTAL SAYS DISABILITIES FOR FORTY FIVE PLUS YEARS WHEN YOU START WHEN YOU'RE. FIVE THIS IS YOUR MY MY EXPERIENCE GIVES ME A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE FEDERALLY MANDATED EARLY START PROGRAM. THE EARLY START PROGRAM IS FOR CHILDREN BIRTH TO THREE WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. THOSE CHILDREN WHO QUALIFY ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE REQUIRED EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES SUCH AS SPEECH. OCCUPATIONAL PHYSICAL THERAPIES AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINE REGIONAL CENTERS WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE NINE FEDERALLY REQUIRED SERVICES TO HELP SUPPORT PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN WHO QUALIFIED FOR THIS BENEFICIAL PROGRAM. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE TRAILER BILL AB X. FOUR NINE AMENDED SECTION THREE GOVERNMENT CODE NINETY FIVE OO TWO OO. MEETING REGIONAL CENTERS FROM PURCHASING NON REQUIRED SERVICES. AMONG THE NON REQUIRED SERVICES THAT REMAIN PROHIBITED IS RESPITE SERVICES. THOSE OF US WHO ARE PARENTS. MOST LIKELY WOULD AGREE THAT RAISING CHILDREN IS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING BUT REWARDING EXPERIENCES THAT WE CAN HAVE. THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ARE BORN WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS IN CARING FOR THESE TYPICALLY DEVELOPING CHILDREN OFTEN CHALLENGES US. TO OUR MAXIMUM CAPACITIES. THE CHILDREN WHO WE SERVE AN EARLY START ARE NOT THESE CHILDREN. THERE PRESS THEY PRESENT WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS. SERIOUS BEHAVIORS AND THE INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE MAKING PARENTING EVEN MORE DEMANDING. IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT YOUR CHILD WAS BORN WITH A HIGH RISK CONDITION AND HOSPITALIZED FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THEIR LIFE. THE CLOSEST CARE FOR YOUR CHILD IS UC DAVIS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILES ONE WAY. YOU SPEND THOSE THREE MONTHS GOING BACK AND FORTH TO THE HOSPITAL TO VISIT WHILE CARING FOR YOUR TWO OTHER CHILDREN AND TRYING TO KEEP YOUR JOB. BUT YOU'VE DONE IT. YOUR CHILD IS NOW HOME BUT NOT DEVELOPING NORMALLY. HE QUALIFIES FOR EARLY START SERVICES HOWEVER BECAUSE OF HIS WRIST CONDITION. YOUR EXHAUSTED AND NEED AN OCCASIONAL BREAK AS ALL PARENTS DO. THERE BUT THERE IS NO ONE QUALIFIED TO CARE FOR YOUR CHILD. THIS IS THE SITUATION THAT MANY OF OUR PARENTS FACE. THEY HAVE NO ONE TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SELF CARE THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT OFTEN SUFFERS FROM THE SITUATION IS THE CRITICAL QUALITY BONDING THAT IS NEEDED FOR ALL CHILDREN TO GROW AND DEVELOP. WHEN LOOKING AT? WHEN LOOKING AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CHILD WE NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE WHOLE CHILD? IN ADDITION THE THERAPIES PARENTS NEED OTHER SUPPORT SUCH AS AN OCCASIONAL BREAK TO BE THE BEST PARENTS THAT THEY CAN BE. DOCTOR BRUCE PERRY A CLINICIAN AND A RESEARCHER IN THE AREAS OF NEUROSCIENCE AND CHILDHOOD MENTAL HELP. STATES FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT IN EARLY INTERVENTION. NINE DOLLARS IS SAVED OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE CHILD. RESPITE IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR A CHILD'S FUTURE. I MY COLLEAGUES IN THE PARENTS THAT WE SERVE. HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATION THAT DOES NOT USURP PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY BUT SPORTS PARENTS TO RAISE THEIR AT RISK CHILDREN TO MAXIMIZE THEIR SKILLS. I GIVEN THE REGIONAL CENTER THE ABILITY ONCE AGAIN TO PURCHASE RESPITE CARE FOR THESE CHILDREN ZERO TO THREE WHO REALLY NEED IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ROBIN -- THAT WAS WONDERFUL ON HERE FOR ME ON THAT AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING -- NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. SO THIS IS WHERE WE HEAR FROM YOU. OTHER REASON MORE HERE BASICALLY. AND SO COME ON UP TO THE MICROPHONE TO SHARE YOUR STORY. IS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME INSURING EVERYBODY HAS A CHANCE TO SPEAK. PLEASE LEAVE YOUR COMMENTS TO COUPLE MINUTES JENNIFER ON MY MY LEFT WILL HAVE A TIME CARD. WHEN YOU'RE DONE AND I WILL BE VERY VERY OF? HELPFUL IN SHARING WITH YOU IT'S YOUR TIME -- SO PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE IS A PUBLIC COMMENT. WE'RE HERE TO HEAR FROM YOU AND AND AND AGAIN A LOT OF LEGISLATION HAS BEEN DERIVED OUT OF THE PARENTS. NEEDS TO BE ALIVE [INAUDIBLE] YEAH. JUST FORM A LINE IN OF LIKE IT'S TOO LONG YOU KNOW YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEND JUMP IN WHEN YOU CAN. QUE. PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME. AND WE'RE FROM. HELLO MY NAME IS RON TO DELIVER AND I AM FROM YOU COUNTY -- I WAS IN PARADISE BUT IT WILL BE ACTUALLY MOVING TO SHASTA COUNTY SHORTLY DUE TO THE CAMPFIRE. I JUST FIRST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO COME TO READING TO HEAR WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS TO SAY REGARDING THE REGIONAL CENTERS. I HAVE A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD SON NAMED COLIN AND HE HAS AUTISM. CALL HAS BEEN A CLIENT WITH FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS. REGIONAL CENTERS ARE UNIQUE IN THAT THEY PROVIDE SERVICES FROM BIRTH TO DEATH. THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY COMFORTING THOUGHT BECAUSE IN OUR SITUATION CALLING DOESN'T HAVE ANY BROTHERS OR SISTERS OR FAMILY TO TAKE CARE OF HIM AFTER WORK ON HIS SERVICE COORDINATOR IS A POINT OF CONTACT AND WORKS WITH HIM AND US TO HELP HIM ACHIEVE WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO AND NECESSARY. FOR HIM TO LIVE A HAPPY HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIFE IN HIS COMMUNITY. WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO FAR NORTHERN FOR THE VARIOUS SERVICES THEY PROVIDED TO HIM OVER THE YEARS. FROM EARLY INTERVENTION DIAGNOSTICS ABA SPEECH THERAPY SOCIAL RACK RESPITE ETCETERA. OF COURSE SOME OF THE SERVICES WERE PROVIDED MANY MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE THE BUDGET CUTS A TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SUSPENDED MANY OF THOSE SERVICES. BUT MY POINT IS FAR NORTHERN HAS HELPED HIM BECOME THE YOUNG MAN HE IS TODAY. HE IS ATTENDING BUTTE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND IS NOW LOOKING AT WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH HIS LIFE. THIS IS NOT TO SUGAR COAT ALL OF THE OBSTACLES AND CHALLENGES HE FACES ON A DAILY BASIS. BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE OPTIONS THAT CAN HELP HIM LIVE AS INDEPENDENTLY AS POSSIBLE WITH FAR NORTHERN HELP. FOR NORTHERN TAKES AN OBSTACLE IN OUR CHALLENGE AND LOOKS FOR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO IT. WITH PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AS THE BASIS FOR ALL INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLANS AND DECISIONS MADE BY THE CLIENTS. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS. INSTEAD OF SAYING NO THAT CAN'T BE DONE THE RESPONSE IS YES AND HOW CAN WE HELP YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. TONIGHT YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT MANY OF THOSE CREATIVE OUT OF THE BOX IDEAS. IT'S ALL VARIOUS ISSUES SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION AND EMPLOYMENT. YOU'VE HEARD FROM SELF ADVOCATES THAT OUR LEADERS NOT ONLY IN THIS COMMUNITY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOR NORTHERN IS KNOWN AND RESPECTED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS AN INNOVATIVE CENTER WITH A HIGH RATE OF EMPLOYMENT. BUT LIKE OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE STATE WE ALSO FACE MANY CHALLENGES HERE ARE JUST A FEW. AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR SOMEONE ON SSI. NEED TO REPEAL THE SUSPENSION OF SERVICES FROM TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED DUE TO THE BUDGET CUTS. IN OPERATIONS FUNDING. REGIONAL CENTERS CANNOT CONTINUE TO FUNCTION WITH SO MANY UNFUNDED MANDATES. FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE HAD THE SAME SERVICE COORDINATOR AND SHE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS WITH COLIN. BUT WITH EVER INCREASING CASELOADS SERVICE COORDINATORS CANNOT POSSIBLY SPEND THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IS REQUIRED. TO TRULY KNOW THEIR CLIENTS AND FAMILIES AS WELL AS THEY COULD AND SHOULD -- AND WELL AS A PARENT.

PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS GIVE ME THE ANSWER IN THIS YOU ASKED. FOR YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK UP. AND THAT'S WHAT KIND OF COLLEGE PLUSES HELP ME DO [INAUDIBLE] WAS.

SORRY WE GET CHOKED UP ON THIS THE I'M SO PART OF IT ONE OF THE BIGGEST VALUES OF SUPPORT OF EMPLOYMENT IN HAVING STORES AND HAVING. COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS IS TO TEACH PEOPLE WHAT ARE DEALT WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES CAN DO.

WHO ARE SETTING UP DIFFERENT WHO ARE WHO ARE EMPLOYING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BUT WHO ARE SETTING UP PROGRAMS?

ON THE SAME KIND OF PROMISE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TONIGHT -- BUT THESE FOLKS ARE HERE ON THEIR OWN TIME -- BECAUSE THEY CARE. AND THEY REALLY DO CARE SO. WHAT WAS NOT MENTIONED AND I I HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF IT BUT I'VE BEEN A VOLUNTEER AT THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GAMES? AND OVER A FEW PAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO RAISE FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE GAMES SO THAT WE CAN HAVE.

FLUCTUATING LEVELS OF SUPPORT IN THE STATE OF THE PAST DECADE -- WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING ON THIS IS? FOR CONSISTENCY IS STILL DO WHAT WE DO WITH EDUCATION PROP NINETY IT WOULD SET THE BAR HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO FIND A CERTAIN ASPECT OF A OF PROGRAM. AND WE HAVE TO WORK TOWARDS THAT BECAUSE FLUCTUATING UP AND DOWN WITH AS THE POPULATION IS GROWING. I THINK IT'S GROWN UP OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE LAST DECADE. OF THAT OF THAT COME INTO THE SYSTEM -- SO NOW WE'RE SERVICING MORE THAN. THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND OF FOLKS -- AND WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE MORE. GOING FORWARD. WELL WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW SOME RECENT BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS THE SYSTEM TO MEET NEEDS. THIS IS JUST A TEMPORARY FIX TO OUR LONG STANDING PROBLEMS -- SO MEMBER HOLDEN MYSELF HELLO BILL THIS YEAR -- THE 8% BRIDGE. MORE OF FUNDING FOR TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT COME THROUGH -- WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED TODAY IN THE MAY REVISE -- HAS I DON'T THINK THAT -- IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED. OF WHERE WE'RE AT SO MY COMMITMENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE I NEED TO WORK HARDER AND SMARTER. TO BE ABLE -- TO THE THE VOICES SACRAMENTO BUT ALSO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. ANYTHING THAT YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP. THE CAUSE LETTER WRITING CALLS. WOULD BE AMAZING -- TO BE ABLE TO TRY.

WHAT'S REALLY DUE TO THE POPULATION. AFTER MANY YEARS OF CUTS AND UNDER FUNDING SERVICES. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT. HEARING. THAT IN THIS PROCESS WE DO NEED TO CREATE WHAT'S CALLED A CAREER PATH. FOR CERTAIN SENSE OF THE POPULATION SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND. THAT IT. DESERVES A LIVING WAGE IT CREATES A RETENTION. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING INTO THIS. HAVE THE PASSION TO BE ABLE TO SERVICE THE COMMUNITY THAT WE HOLD DEAR -- AND FOR THAT. THAT IS MY COMMITMENT ALSO IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CREATE THOSE. CAREER PASS LIKE WE DO NURSES ARE NURSES AIDES OR SOMETHING OF THAT FASHION. WE ALSO WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SERVICE OF OF FAMILIES BEING SERVICED BY THE SYSTEM. YOU CAN FIND A LINK TO THE SURVEY ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE FELT INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WEBSITE -- LOOK FOR THE HAND OUT ON THE TABLE OUT THERE ON THE WAY OUT.

AND YOU KNOW IT IT WE HEAR ABOUT THIS COMMON THREAD [INAUDIBLE] OF SUPPORT. SUPER SUPPORTIVE PARENTS WITH PARENTS. SUPPORT OF THE REGIONAL CENTER -- BUT WE DO KNOW. THERE'S MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. AGAIN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE LACKING IS PROVIDERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT. AND I FEEL THAT WE NEED TO REALLY MAKE AN EFFORT. TO ENCOURAGE. FOLKS. TO BECOME EMPLOYERS TO BECOME PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES ARE LACKING. BUT IT ALSO FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE.
