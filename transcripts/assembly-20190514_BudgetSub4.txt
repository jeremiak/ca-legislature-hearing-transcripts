THIS CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES WE ALSO APPLAUD -- THE GOVERNOR'S -- WE BELIEVE PRUDENT STEPS -- TO THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN -- TO EXPAND ON THE I. T. C. -- THAT WE'VE HAD THE STATE -- LIFT -- LOW INCOME FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY WE THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND ACT ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND ALLIES -- ON THE INCLUSION OF ITUNES FILERS WE BELIEVE THESE FOLKS MAKE UP THE BACKBONE OF MANY COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE WORK FORCE MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WE THINK IS FOR THIS PRUDENT TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS ARE PAYING TAXES GET -- A BENEFIT -- WE WOULD -- ALSO -- SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S TAX CONFORMITY PROPOSAL -- BUT AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WOULD ALSO -- ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF CONCERN AROUND IDEA OF OPPORTUNITIES OWNS -- WE'VE SEEN THAT PLAY OUT -- IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND NOT NECESSARILY BE AS BENEFICIAL -- THE CALIFORNIANS -- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TAX CONFORMITY PACKAGE US CONSTRUCTED A DOES A GOOD JOB OF GENERATING REVENUE AND NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE EITC IS NOT LINKED -- TO THE GENERAL FUND -- IN OUT YEARS -- IN JUST AS AN ASIDE -- IN FUTURE YEARS WE WOULD IMPLORE THIS COMMITTEE ON THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE INCLUSION. OF FAMILY HOME CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM OUR RECEIVING A BENEFIT TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE WORK THAT THESE FOLKS TO CENTRAL TO ASSURING THAT FOLKS CAN GET. A SERVICES IN THEIR HOMES -- AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ARE INSTITUTIONALIZE A WE BELIEVE THIS OF OF VALUE -- AND THINK THAT -- THEY SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR THE WORK THAT THEY PROVIDE THANK YOU. HI ESPERANZA GIVE HONOR WITH CHIRLA WE JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WOULD LIKE FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE STATE CREDIT TO INCLUDE IMMIGRANTS WHO FILE TAXES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'RE HOLES AUTUMN OPEN ONE OUR NEXT ITEM -- ET I SEE ADVANCE PAYMENTS -- SO IN ORDER TO PROVIDE MORE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE TO FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY FOR THE KELLY AT SEE COST OF LIVING REFUND. THE MAY REVISE POSES TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. ESTABLISH A PROGRAM FOR PROVIDING ADVANCE EITC PAYMENTS TO FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY. MANY ADVOCATE FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE RECOMMENDED MOVING TO MONTHLY PAYMENTS FOR YOU EIGHTY C. AS WE'D BETTER. HELP FAMILIES MEET ENDS MEET. INSTEAD OF WAITING ALL YEAR TO RECEIVE THEIR EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AT AT THE END OF THE YEAR AT TAX TIME FAMILIES WOULD RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. RAISING THEIR INCOME EVERY MONTH SINCE MOVING -- THE INCOME BALTO. SO WHAT THE MAY REVISED POSES IS THAT FRANCHISE TAX WILL DEVELOP A SYSTEM. FOR PROVIDING ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN CAL THE ADC RECIPIENTS. THE PROGRAM WOULD BE OPEN TO ANY HELP HOUSEHOLD THAT HAS FILED A RETURN -- FILED AT LEAST ONE RETURN WITH THE FTV IN THE PRIOR FIVE YEARS AND HIS INCOME AND INCOME CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M SORRY HOUSEHOLD INCOME CIRCUMSTANCES. ARE SUCH THAT THEY EXPECT TO RECEIVE A CAL THE ATC OF AT LEAST TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- SO THE WAY THAT THE MONTHLY PAYMENT WOULD WORK IS THAT -- IF IF YOU QUALIFY FOR LET'S SAY A TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CREDIT. YOU WOULD -- WE WOULD HAVE TO BE WOULD CUT THAT AMOUNT AND HALF. HELP FOR RESULT GO IN TWO MINUTES AND THEN DIVIDE THAT OVER THE REMAINING MONTHS OF THE YEAR SO IF YOU'VE GOT TWELVE MONTHS LEFT. IN THE YEAR. ARE THE TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WOULD BE CUT DOWN SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THEN TO BE. FIFTY TWELVE FIFTY DOLLAR PAYMENTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. I'M. THE REASON THAT THAT IT WOULD BE CUT IN HALF IS THAT THERE'S A REAL CONCERN. THAT IN RECEIVING ADVANCE PAYMENTS IT'S DIFFICULT TO PREDICT PRECISELY WHICH EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IS GOING TO BE. AND SO WE WANT TO AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. HOUSEHOLDS GETTING ADVANCEMENTS THAT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE A TO SEE THAT THE ACTUALLY EARN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR -- AND SO WITH YOUR BY CUTTING FIVE LIMITED IT ONLY GETTING HALF OF THEIR EXPECTED THE IDC. THANK THE GREATLY REDUCES THE THE POSSIBILITY OF OVERPAYMENT. AS IF THEY ARE OVER PAID THAT HAVE TO BE WILL WILL HAVE. TO TRY TO CUT TRY DO THAT THE MONEY WILL THEN BE OWED WHEN THEY FILED THEIR TAX RETURN THAT COULD CAUSE A BURDEN ON THE ON THE HOUSEHOLDS [inaudible] COME. THERE IS THERE HAS BEEN SOME QUESTION RAISED ABOUT -- WHETHER. RECEIPT OF THESE MONTHLY PAYMENTS AS OPPOSED TO RECEIVING OF THE AGENCY AT THE END OF YOUR MIGHT. IMPACT SOME FEDERAL -- THE RECEIPT THE RECEIPT OF SOME FEDERAL PROGRAMS -- PARTICULAR CAL FRESH AND HAD SECTION. EIGHT HOUSING ASSISTANCE -- AND AS WELL AS OTHER PROGRAMS SO -- IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AT THAT -- WILL BE AVAILABLE SHORTLY -- WE WERE WE HAVE -- WE MAKE ANY ANY WORK TO DO THIS ADVANCE PAYMENT CONTINGENT UPON. THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE CERTIFYING THAT -- THAT THERE WILL BE NO IMPACT SO THAT MOST LIKELY WILL MEAN GETTING WAIVERS FROM FEDERAL AGENCIES -- AND WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT THAT IS GOING TO TAKE OF A FEW MONTHS AT LEAST -- EVEN WITHOUT ONCE ONCE HAVE TO BE HAS BEEN GIVEN -- CLEARANCE ESSENTIALLY THAT THAT THIS WILL NOT AFFECT RECEIPT OF OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAM DOLLARS -- IT WILL TAKE ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR IT TO BE TO GET THE SYSTEMS UP AND RUNNING. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE -- THE THE ADVANCE PAYMENT SO. THE EARLIEST WE WOULD EXPECT TO BE PROVIDING ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO BE SOMETIME IN EARLY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY REPOSITORY CELLS QUORUM RIGHT NOW. THE LOCAL POLICE. FIRE HERE. TO LACKEY. NAZARIAN WICKS. THERE WERE TO MOVE BACK TO ISSUE NUMBER -- ONE RECOGNITIONS DOT THE SPRING FISCAL LETTER -- IZZARD MOTION CAN GO TO MOTIONS SECOND ROLL CALL PLEASE COOPER HI TO LACKEY SYRIAN BRICKS. THEY WILL CONTINUE NOW THE L. L.. BRAIN WHETHER FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- IN ORDER -- IN REVIEWING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- FOR PRESS APPROACH TO PROVIDING MONTHLY PAYMENTS WE NOTED THAT THE PROPOSED APPLICATION PROCESS INVOLVES REQUIRING -- FILERS TO FIRST REGISTER WITH THE MY F. T. P. INTERNET APPLICATION -- IT THIS IS A A REASONABLE APPROACH IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING -- THE THE FILERS IDENTITY IN VERIFYING THE ADDRESS HOWEVER WE KNOW IT'S A IT'S A FAIRLY COMPLICATED TO PART PROCESS THAT CAN TAKE -- ANYWHERE FROM -- A ONE TO TWO ONE TO THREE WEEKS TO COMPLETE AND AND THEN THE FILER WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR A A MONTHLY PAYMENT AT THAT TIME. AND SO THERE'S A THREE AT LEAST A THREE STEP PROCESS REQUIRED. TO APPLY IN AND IT SEEMS LIKE THIS MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR VOTERS WHO WERE -- SEEKING ASSISTANCE AND AND AND AND RECEIVING MONTHLY PAYMENTS AND WE WE WE JUST ON THINK THAT THERE MAY BE TIME. TO STEP BACK AND AND THINK ABOUT HOW ELSE WE MIGHT DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM SO THAT IT'S THAT IS DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT IS -- USER FRIENDLY AND AND AND STILL PROTECTS AGAINST -- OVERPAYMENTS -- TO TO TO FILERS SO WE THINK THAT YOU HAVE TIME -- IT. IT DURING THE PROCESS AS DEPARTMENT FINANCE MENTIONED SEEKING THESE WAIVERS AND AND THEN IF THE WAIVERS ARE RECEIVED QUICKLY YOU CAN -- PERHAPS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDE -- SOME FUNDING TO FTP CONTINGENT ON RECEIVING THOSE WAIVERS -- AND THEN REVISITING THIS IN JANUARY ON ON WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALTHOUGH AN OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- TERRY OLD FROM ECONOMIC SECURITY PROJECT ACTION I GUESS I'VE THREE COMMENTS -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO JUST APPLY THE GOVERNOR AND THE STAFF -- FOR BEING INNOVATIVE ABOUT MOVING TOWARD MONTHLY AND ADVANCE PAYMENTS WITH THE ATC THIS IS A REALLY GREAT WAY TO MAKE THESE. THE THIS CREDIT EVEN MORE USEFUL IN PEOPLE'S LIVES SMOOTHING OUT INCOME VOLATILITY AND HELPING -- PEOPLE MEET THEIR BUDGET ON A MONTHLY BASIS WE THINK IT'S REALLY FANTASTIC IT WOULD PUT CALIFORNIA HAS OF THE GAME IN THE REST THE COUNTRY -- SECOND ALL I REALLY ENCOURAGE. YOU ALL TO PUT A STAKE IN THE GROUND ON STARTING DOWN THE ROAD OF IMPLEMENTING RECOGNIZING THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME. AND RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AS USER FRIENDLY AS YOU SAY AND AS AND DOESN'T CAUSE HARDSHIP FOR EITHER THE FILERS OR FOR THE STATE -- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT PUTTING A STAKE IN THE GROUND AND STARTING DOWN THAT PATH IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT MOMENTUM. AND FINALLY I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE TIME TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY -- TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROCESS AND ENGAGE WITH EXPERTS ON USER EXPERIENCE EXPERTS -- WITH AFFECTED GROUPS SO THAT WE CAN -- FIND THE BEST WAY TO TO MAKE THIS IS FRICTIONLESS AS POSSIBLE OF FOR THE APPLICANTS BECAUSE WITH THE LAST THING ON EARTH WE WANT TO DO IS CREATE A GREAT PROGRAM THAT NO ONE CAN. NO ONE CAN ACCESS. AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I NEGLECTED FROM MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS ON THE PREVIOUS MATTER WHICH IS THAT I AM ALSO IN IN FAVOR OF THE CONFORMITY -- ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MIGHT FORGOT TO SAY THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WELL MISTER CHAIR MY CAROL AGAIN WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO DO ADVANCE PAYMENTS WE THINK THERE IS A LOT OF AMERICA THIS WEEK CONCURRENT MUCH OF WHAT MISS ALL THE JUST HAD TO SAY WE WOULD RAISE JUST A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL POINTS ONE AS WE AGREE WITH THE LA OWES ANALYSIS. ABOUT THE POTENTIAL CUMBERSOME THIS OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL BY ON THE BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS AND WE WOULD URGE THE AT THAT APARTMENT. TO PERHAPS TAKE A LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN STREAMLINE THIS AND MAKE THIS A A SIMPLER PROCESS MORE ONE STEP APPROACH THAN THE CURRENT APPROACH -- SECOND -- WE IT'S NOT OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE NEED A WAIVER FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THESE PURPOSES THAT. KATAKANA TAKES A LEGAL -- STANDARD THAT I THINK WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS A CLARIFICATION AND I THINK THERE BE OTHER STATES WILL BE SEEKING THE SAME CLARIFICATION AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY DO NOT. WANT TO JEOPARDIZE PEOPLE'S CALPERS BENEFITS ARE MEDI CAL BENEFITS THEY'RE SECTION. EIGHT AND AND THEN LASTLY I DO WANT TO ALSO FLAG AND BRING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL AND THE DEPARTMENT MENTION THIS -- THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF OVER PAYMENTS WERE REDO ADVENT WE HAVE ADVANCE PAYMENTS. ON THE LAST THING WE WANT FOR OUR FOR OUR LOW INCOME CLIENTS TO HAVE HIS START GETTING TAX LIENS AND NOTICES FROM FTP THAT THEY OWE MONEY. SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A REALLY DO THIS SMART AND CAREFULLY AND WHILE WE WANT TO GET AS MUCH MONEY AS WE CAN AND WORK POINT STANCE WE DON'T WANT TO GET TOO MUCH MONEY IN HER CLIENT SANDS. SO THAT I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE WE GO FORWARD IN CONSIDER THIS -- I GUESS I AGREE WE DO NEED TO GET THE IT DEPARTMENT THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS BUT I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO TAKE IT SLOW AND CAREFUL THANK YOU. BUT YOU. I THINK YOU WILL SEE AGAIN WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I JUST WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF MR HERALD COMMENTS AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT WE SECURE WHATEVER. APPROVALS WE NEED -- FOR SUCH THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THIS INCOME IS NOT COUNTED -- AGAINST THESE FAMILIES -- FOR OTHER FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS WE DON'T WANNA DISADVANTAGED THE SAME FAMILIES IN THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE CRITICAL SUPPORTS AS WELL THANK YOU. FOLLOWING UP ON THE WAY THE QUESTION IS DO AS IT DEAL HAVE HAD TIME TO TALK TO VERY STAKEHOLDERS. WILL BE IMPACTED. I WE'VE TALKED MANY STAKEHOLDER SINCE PROCESS YES AND MOODY'S STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING PEOPLE WOULD BE AFFECTED. MORE SOULS COMMENTS -- THERE WERE SOME COMMENTS WELL THERE THERE WERE COMMENTS WERE GENERALLY FAVORABLE TOWARDS US ARE SOME COMMENTS ARE SUGGESTING. ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS A DEFERRED PAYMENTS -- WHICH IS WHERE. RATHER THAN PAYING THE THE EHC IN ADVANCE YOU WOULD WAIT. TILL THEY FILED A RETURN IN AND YOU SAY OKAY YOU ARMED TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WILL PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE NEXT. TWELVE MONTHS -- THERE CERTAINLY ARE SOME ADVANTAGE TO THAT NOT CLEAR. WHETHER WHETHER PEOPLE WOULD BE% INTERESTED IN IN GETTING THAT -- SO I'LL BE OTHER VARIETY OF COMMENTS. AS FAR AS THE CHAINS GO TO THE I. T. C. PROGRAM HOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO OUT REACH TO COMMUNICATE THESE CHANGES. TO THE PUBLIC I I HAVE NOT FULLY THOUGHT THROUGH HOW HOW WE WOULD COMMUNICATE CLEARLY WITH WE WOULD NEED TO TO DO SOME COMMUNICATION THOUGH TO LET OTHER PEOPLE KNOW THIS NEW PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE. WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS Q. CIRCLE BACK WITH STAFF PLEASE? CERTAINLY OKAY -- IS IN THE BLUEPRINT SUPPORTIVE OF AN ADVANCE PAYMENT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE TAKE THE TIME TO CRAPPIE THOUGHTFUL ADVANCE PAYMENT MECHANISM. IT LOOKS LIKE WITH TIME SINCE THE STATE STILL NEED TO GO TO THE WAIVER PROCESS. SO WHEN ALL THIS ITEM OPEN. I'M SORRY. MR. TO JUST WANNA SAY -- ONE ECHO WHAT THE TERM JUST SAID AND I THINK WE ALL SUPPORT THE IDEA MONTH ADVANCE PAYMENT BUT THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED BY STAFF. I THINK ARE ONES THAT WE'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WE WANT TO DO IT BUT WE WANT TO GET IT DONE RIGHT -- I'M NOT SURE IF THE FIRST QUESTION WAS ASKED OF IF YOU IF YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE FEDERAL WAIVERS GOING TO TAKE. WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY -- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT HE COULD BE THREE MONTHS OR MORE SO OKAY AND I'M ASSUMING THAT TIME WE HAVE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN YOU CAN CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND AND FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT DETAILS ON THIS. THAT THAT'S TRUE I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT IT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE BUDGET IF WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED ON DOING ANYTHING THIS FISCAL YEAR SO. OKAY WELL AGAIN WITH AND AGAIN ECHOING WHEN THE CONCERNS I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC ON THIS -- WANNA MAKE SURE PARTICULAR WHERE ADDRESSING -- IN THE CONCERNS AROUND -- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MONTHLY BENEFITS AND AND AND MAKE SURE WE GET THIS DONE RIGHT. THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR OF RESULTS. RIGHT SO -- SORT ARE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL WHICH IT'S PART OF OUR IT WAS ALSO -- IN OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL -- ALEX COMBINED WITH THE CONFORMITY PACKAGE IN THE EIGHTY SI PACKAGE. WOULD PROVIDE TAX BREAKS WOULD CONFORM TO FEDERAL TAX BREAKS FOR INVESTMENT. IN CALL FOR CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITIES OWN PROJECTS -- TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT FEDERAL TAX IN JOBS I CAN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CREATED OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. ALL STATES WERE ALLOWED TO DESIGNATE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IN CERTAIN LOW INCOME AREAS. AND CALIFORNIA'S PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROCESS AND DESIGNATED -- EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE OPPORTUNITIES HOMES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. INVESTMENT IS ENCOURAGED BY SEVERAL CENTERS AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO NOW OF HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON WHAT THOSE INCENTIVES ARE BUT THEIR SUBSTANTIAL INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO INVEST IN THESE. ZONES. WE ARE PROPOSING AND MAY RISE MAY REVISED TO CONFORM TO THESE TAX INCENTIVES. FOR INVESTMENT INOPPORTUNE SO THAT ARE DIRECTED PROJECTS THAT ARE BOTH WITHIN CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITIES OWNS SO LIMITED TO CALIFORNIA. AND ARE OF OF QUALIFY TYPE OF INVESTMENT AND THE QUALIFY TYPES INVESTMENT. WOULD BE INVESTMENT THAT FOCUS ON LOW INCOME HOUSING. AND THAT FOCUS ON GREEN ENERGY -- WE ALSO -- ARE PUTTING. ON A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THEY CAN GO INTO THESE STONES SO THAT -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN RAISED ABOUT POTENTIAL OPEN ENDED REVENUE LOSSES AND SO -- WE WILL HAVE A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING INTO THE INTO THE ZONE SO THAT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE LOSSES IS CAPPED. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO MORE DETAIL ON ON THE U. L. L.. THANK YOU WE HAVE A FEW CONCERNS -- WITH THE WITH THE PROPOSAL FIRST -- RESEARCH ON PAST PROGRAM SIMILAR TO OPPORTUNITIES OWNS OF FOUND MIXED EVIDENCE ABOUT THEIR WHETHER OR NOT THEY BRING POSITIVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE TARGETED COMMUNITIES AND BECAUSE OF THAT. WE THINK THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WILL RECEIVE POSITIVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM THE PROGRAM -- SECONDLY IF CALIFORNIA WHERE DOES CREATE A STATE OPPORTUNITIES DON'T BENEFIT -- WE THINK AT THAT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TAX BENEFIT. A WOULD GO NOT TO INVESTORS THAT ARE -- BRINGING NEW INVESTMENT SHIFTING IT FROM OTHER STATES BUT INSTEAD OF PROVIDING BENEFIT -- TO INVESTORS WHO WOULD HAVE INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA ANYWAY SIMPLY IN RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. AND FINALLY WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS A PROBABLY AREN'T THE BEST MECHANISM FOR FUNDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- WE THINK OF THAT THE STATE'S HAS SEVERAL EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROBABLY BETTER THAN OPPORTUNITIES OWNS FOR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND NOT MOVING FORWARD WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THANK YOU. DOES THE MINISTER SHOULD HAVE AN IDEA ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WILL BE AVAILABLE. FOR THE TROUBLE I'M SORRY -- WE'RE SHOOTING FOR LATER THIS WEEK. THERE THIS WEEK YEAH. OKAY QUESTION COMMITTEE. MISTER IS THERE A GOD. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL -- INTERESTED TO REVISIT WITH THE LA -- WAS SAYING AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK OF BETTER OVERSIGHT WILL PROBABLY HELP -- OVERCOME SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. WITH A WITH A WITH OTHER PROGRAMS SIMILAR PROGRAMS THAT WE HAD IN PLACE -- SO BE INTERESTED TO SEE IF OVERSIGHT COULD BE A BETTER COMPONENT ADDED COMPONENT TO THIS SO THAT -- WE CAN GO FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL -- BUT ALSO KNOW HOW WE CAN HOLD IT ACCOUNTABLE -- THROUGH THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WELL AS TO AN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE -- BUT WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION I HAD A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE I GUESS THAT THE FORM OF HOW YOU MOVE FORWARD. OF WHITE WHAT IS THE MINISTRATION PREFER TAX BREAKS. THROUGH TAX CONFORMITY INSTEAD OF SOMETHING MORE EASILY MEASURED AND UP. LIKE A TAX CREDIT. THAT WE CAN POTENTIALLY BE OFFERING SO THAT IT WOULD ALSO GIVE US SOME LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY. YEAH I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IS DO SOMETHING THAT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT -- WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN FEDERAL LEVEL SO THAT SO THAT IT IT'S EASY FOR TAXPAYERS IF THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO WE'RE TRYING TO LEVERAGE THE FEDERAL TAX BREAKS AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE A TAX BREAKS THAT ARE COMPARABLE. TO WHAT THEY'RE PROVIDED SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT. IF YOU'RE GETTING THESE THESE TAX BREAKS FEDERAL OVER THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE SAME ONES FOR CALIFORNIA. I THINK I THINK YEAH YOU COULD OFFER A CREDIT AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND I BUT I THINK WE FIGURED SOMEBODY'S NEVER BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YES YEAH. YOU WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO BETTER BUT WITH THESE -- TAX BREAKS IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE INVESTORS ARE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THE FEDERAL TAX BREAKS AND SO THE BEGINNING THE SAME THING FOR CALIFORNIA C. COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE. TO INVESTORS TOO MANY THAT WE ARE ON A ON A PER DOLLAR BASIS. HAVE WE HAVE HAVE WE TALK TO FOLKS IN THE HOUSING INDUSTRY TO SEE WHAT ROUTE THEY WOULD. PREFER OR HOW WHAT WOULD WORK BETTER. IF I HOUSING IS A COMPONENT IN THIS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT I HAVE NOT [inaudible] OKAY -- HAS THERE BEEN ANY DETAILS THAT. HAS BEEN HAVE BEEN RELEASED ON THIS THAT -- WE MAY HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW OR SEE THERE'S AS FAR AS THE TRAILER BILL I MEAN I HAVE I'M NOT SURE I I'VE. A JUST SOME THOUGHTS ON WHERE WHERE THIS IS GOING. IN IN THE IN PARTICULAR I I COULD I CAN GIVE YOU WHATEVER DETAILS I HAVE. WELL JUST THE GENERAL GUIDELINES OF WHAT THIS IS GONNA LOOK LIKE HOW. THE HOW WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT. WELL IT WOULD BE -- WE WENT OVER HOLDING THE ITEM OPEN BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE IF. THERE'S ANY FURTHER THOUGHTS THAT YOU CAN OFFER -- FOR AT LEAST FOR TODAY -- IT WILL BE A TAX BENEFIT THE LOOKS LIKE THE FEDERAL TAX BENEFIT IN TERMS OF GETTING THE DFERRAL AND THE BASIS ADJUSTMENT -- IF IF YOU HOLD ON FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND THEN GETTING -- HE AN EXEMPTION FROM CAPITAL GAINS TAXES FOR IN EARNINGS INSIDE THE FUND -- IT WILL BE LIMITED AS AS I SAID -- TO ARE PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA -- FEE THE FUND WILL THE FUND WILL HAVE TO BE A 1100% CALIFORNIA. OF FUND -- IT WILL BE IF YOU'LL BE TAKING THE PORTION OF IT THE TO CALIFORNIA BUT IF THE FUND MUST BE DEDICATED TO CALIFORNIA -- AND FOR FOR THE LOW INCOME HOUSING -- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS IS -- BASICALLY THE SAME RULES. THAT WOULD APPLY TO THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT OF THE THERE THERE HAVE TO BE 20% OF THE UNITS. A MEETING -- HOUSING FOR PEOPLE OVER 50% OF AREA -- MEDIAN INCOME OR 40%. OF THE UNITS -- OF HOUSING PEOPLE WITH UNDER 6% SO THE SAME RULES I DON'T KNOW -- SAME RULES WE HAVE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT SO I'M I'M NOT SURE WHAT ALL DETAILS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THEM. AND AND EACH TRAILER BILL SHE'LL BE OUT SHOULD BE OUT SOON AND AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU A LOT OF DETAIL. MR. TO WANNA JUST BUILT ON THE QUESTIONS NOW FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM FROM LA -- YOU SAID THAT THE REASON TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TAX BREAK IS TO COME INTO CONFORMITY WITH -- THE FEDERAL -- TAX PROPOSAL THAT THE FEDERAL TAX LAW THAT -- THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS HAS MOVED THROUGH. BUT YOU ALSO MENTION THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT WHICH HAS BEEN A PROVEN TAX CREDIT. WHICH IS -- A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT AND WE HAVE A STATE. COUNTERPART TO THAT -- AND THERE'S BEEN A DISCUSSION FOR YEARS ABOUT EXPANDING THAT TAX CREDIT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LEVERAGING FEDERAL AND STATE TAX DOLLARS TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THAT PROGRAM IS MEASURED IT'S CAPPED IT'S PROVEN. AND TO MR NEWS ARIENS QUESTION OF WHERE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORLD HAS BEEN -- THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY HAS ASKED US IN THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND THE TAX CREDIT BUT THEY'VE NOT ASKED US. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CONFORMITY AROUND OPPORTUNITY SOUNDS I WILL SAY THE OPPORTUNITIES ON CONVERSATION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S REALLY INTERESTING IT'S NEW. OR TRY TO WRAP OUR BRAINS AROUND IT BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING US TO DECIDE ON A TAX BREAK THAT. WE'RE NOT SURE HOW IT'S GONNA WORK. VERSUS SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS TESTED THAT IS WORKING IN OUR LOCAL AND STATEWIDE MARKETS. AGAIN EASY MEASURED AND CAPPED. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S PRETTY EASY CALL SO AND AND AND THE GOVERNOR -- HAS PUBLICLY STATED HIS COMMITMENT TO AN EXPANSION BEFORE BY HOUSING TAX CREDIT IS YOU KNOW THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET HE PUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXPANSION. BUT JUST ONE YEAR NOT A MULTI YEAR -- INCREASE AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT BEFORE WILL HOUSING MARKETS WOULD REACT MUCH BETTER TO KNOWING THAT THERE'S ONGOING FUNDING SO GIVEN ALL THAT. HOW IS IT THAT YOU? DECIDED THAT YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE ONGOING TAX BREAK AS OPPOSED TO AN ONGOING MEASUREABLE CAPS. TESTED TAX CREDIT. BY THE ONGOING TAX RATE YOU MEAN THE OPPORTUNITIES OWN CORRECT WHICH WHICH WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED THAT WE EXPECT MOST THAT INVESTMENT TO OCCUR IN THE IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS -- BUT ESSENTIALLY WE'RE WE'RE ADEQUATE SO COST US. YEAH THE THE COST WILL BE PART IN THE SHORT TERM AND THEN AGAIN IN THE AND THE LONG TERM THAT'S RIGHT -- WEARS A TAX CREDIT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE SPENDING EVERY YEAR AND IF WE NEEDED TO DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMY IN A AND BUDGET PICTURES RATCHET UP RATCHET DOWN IF WE NEED. TO WITH WHAT WAS SOME LIKE YES WHERE IS IF WE VOTE ON THIS TAX BREAK. LITTLE UNCLEAR HOW THAT GETS CAPPED WELL IT'S CAPTAIN THE IN THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THEY CAN BE PUT INTO THE FUNDS IS CAPPED. COURSE ARE STILL WAITING FOR LANGUAGE FOR THAT SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I I GUESS MY BROADER QUESTION IS AN INTEREST BUILDING ON MISTER HIS ERRANT'S POINT. IS. DO YOU SEE OPPORTUNITIES OUT AS A BETTER MEANS OF INVESTING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THAN. EXPANDING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT WHICH THE STATEWIDE HOUSING COMMUNITY. THINKS IS THE BETTER THING TO DO JUST WANNA YEAH I KNOW THIS IS LESLIE Là THIS IS NOT A A FOR ONE OR THE OTHER THIS IS THIS IS AN INTENTIONAL -- INCENTIVE OKAY. EVEN THOUGH AT THIS MOMENT THERE'S NOT A COMMITMENT FOR A MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT STATE. YES SO IT IS A CHOICE FOR MAKING LONG TERM -- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT OKAY I I I JUST WANT TO SAY I OBVIOUSLY I STILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND IF WE GET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT. MOVES IN THE DIRECTION I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO -- I'M NOT SURE I'M GONNA BE I AND I HAVE BEEN IN A A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR EXPANDING THE FOR WHILE THE TAX CREDIT WHICH IS WHAT STATEWIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ASKING FOR FOR YEARS SO JUST WANNA PUT THAT OUT THERE HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH. YOUR APARTMENT AND OTHERS ON THIS TOPIC BUT THE FOR A HOUSING TAX CREDIT HAS BEEN SUPPORTED ON A STRONG BIPARTISAN BASIS IN THIS HOUSE -- AND I THINK THE CASE STILL NEEDS TO BE MADE ON OPPORTUNITIES US AGAIN INTERESTING. OPEN TO IT BUT WE REALLY NEED TO SEE MORE INFORMATION. CERTAINLY THANKS PRETTY SOON -- GOING UP A PUBLIC COMMENT YES. MR YOUR CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF LIKE THIS ONE YES ON THE HAVE A CAL O. Z. WE DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALTHOUGH THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE WOULD SEEK THE FIRST IS AN EXPANSION BEYOND -- CLEAN TECH AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING A TO FULLER CONFORMITY AND ALSO ON THE FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT CONTAIN A NUMBER OF METRICS AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF TRANSPARENCY WHICH WE WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT AS WELL. WHILE WORKING WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG ON HIS SB -- THREE FIFTEEN THAT MIGHT GO ALONG THOSE WAYS SO WITH THAT WE URGE -- YOUR ADOPTION OF THE FULLER CONFORMITY PACKAGE THANK YOU YOU. HI MISTER SHERMAN MEMBERS FOR CHILLED WITH CALIFORNIA FOR THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT WHAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU JUST HAD WITH CALLUM SEE MORE IMPORTANTLY. THAT THERE'S A SENSE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT OUR SKEPTICISM ABOUT THIS AND MUCH OF THAT. IS BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH ENTERPRISE ZONES AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT. OF A POTENTIAL FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY IN WHICH THE ENTERPRISE ZONE MODEL WORKED. SO DON'T RELY ON OUR GOOD FRIENDS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S TO LOOKED AT THE ENTERPRISE ZONES MANY OF US DID AND SAID THAT THING DIDN'T WORK PROPERLY THIS ONE WORKS MUCH DIFFERENTLY. AND THE REASON THAT IT DOES IS IT RELIES ON THE ABILITY OF A PRIVATE INVESTOR. TO PUT MONEY INTO A PROJECT THAT HAS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT OR THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BASICALLY UNDER FINANCED. THAT CAN GO ALONG WITH MATCHING STATE. FUNDS PARTICULARLY FOR HOUSING FOR THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. BECAUSE INEVITABLY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDER HAS A CAPITAL STOCK THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET MONEY OUT OF THAT LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT BUT THEY MAY NEED THAT LAST FIVE TEN FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS SITTING IN A CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUND. CURRENTLY THERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FUNDS NATION WIDE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING THE NUMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ONES MR GENERAL MAY KNOW. HOME HOW MANY THERE ARE EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FUNDS THERE -- I'M -- NO I'M SORRY YEAH THAT THERE ARE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY NATIONWIDE MANY OF THEM ARE FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES OR INDIVIDUAL STATES SOME OF THEM ARE. FOCUSED ON MULTI FAMILY HOUSING SOME OF THEM ARE FOCUSED ON JOB CREATION AND MANUFACTURING. AND SO PLEASE DO TWO THINGS WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. YOUR ACTION ABOUT HOW THE STATE OUGHT -- TO PUT TOGETHER THIS POTENTIAL FOR INVESTMENT IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. TWO THINGS ONE OF THEM IS MAKE SURE AS CHRIS POINTED OUT YOU NEED SOME TRACKING MECHANISM YOU NEED SOME STATE ORGANIZATION TO WATCH AND SEE HOW THAT INVESTMENT WORKED THE OTHER IS KEEP YOUR MINDS OPEN TO A BROADER CONFORMITY. THEN A KIND OF PROJECT BY PROJECT NARAL -- CONFORMING TREATMENT I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THE CITY OF STOCKTON WHICH IS SO CALLED OPPORTUNITIES ALREADY THEY'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK HAS ITS OWN REASONS. FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT WILL OCCUR IN DOWNTOWN STOCKTON THE CITY OF SAN JOSE HAS A DIFFERENT SET. THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY SO THAT'S PRIMARILY AN AREA FOR GROWING MANUFACTURING THAT'S WHERE THEY WANTED VESTMENT SO YOU NEED SOME AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION. IN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONFORM TO SO DON'T ASSUME THAT IT'S ONLY. THE THE SUBMISSION OF PAPERWORK TO F. T. B. THAT DETERMINES WHAT GETS CONFORMING TREATMENT BUT RATHER THE COMMUNITY HAS SOME INTEREST. IN SO OP GOOD LUCK -- ON THE NEXT PHASE WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO LOOKING AT THE TRYING TO LIKE THANK YOU. I GUESS WE'LL SIT DOWN THIS ROUND. SANTA CORBIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AND I'D LIKE TO AFFILIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE ALEJO. ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF US SO WE HAVE TO OPERATE NOT ON WHAT WE ASSUME BUT WE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE EXISTING FEDERAL PROGRAM -- I WOULD REFER YOU TO AN ALL MAKE SURE YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF THIS IN YOUR OFFICE A RECENT REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER WHICH IN FACT DOES ANALYZE THE FEDERAL PROGRAM -- AND IDENTIFIES A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FLAWS AND EXPLICITLY STATES -- CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE PROGRAM IS REALLY DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE WEALTHY -- WITH POTENTIAL HARM TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND SO WE WOULD WANT TO SEE A PROPOSAL -- CERTAINLY THAT HAD TRACKING MECHANISMS BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE BUDGETING WHERE PRIORITIZING -- AND YOU KNOW THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO WRITE FULLY IDENTIFIED OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE DO NO WORK AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ENTERPRISE ZONES WAS THAT IN SPITE OF THE BEST INTENTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE. IN SPITE OF EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE -- OR WERE UP SORT OF THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL TO ACCESS PROGRAMMING THAT THOSE WERE FREQUENTLY GAMES -- AT THE EXPENSE OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND TAXPAYERS ACROSS THE STATE AND CERTAINLY WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESPECT LOCAL NEED I'M SURE THOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON HOUSING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS ALSO KNOW. THAT NAME BE ISM IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND THAT PRIORITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS REFLECT THE BEST IN CREEK INTEREST.% OF OUR LOW INCOME TAXPAYERS -- AND SO AS A RESULT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO ACTUALLY DRIVE GENTRIFICATION AN INCREASE COST PRESSURES ON LOW INCOME CONSUMERS -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE OUR OPPOSITION ALTHOUGH WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE WHOLE SIDE OF OPEN. MOVING ON TO XIN REVIVE SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTIONS DIAPERS MISTER PRODUCTS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. ALL RIGHT SO -- MAY REVISE WE PROVIDE AND OF ME REVISED PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION. OF FROM SALES AND USE TAX FOR SALES OF DIAPERS MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS. I CALIFORNIA GENERALLY TAXES THE SALE OF ALL TENSION PERSONAL PROPERTY UNLESS THERE'S A SPECIFIC EXEMPTION FROM THE SALES TAX -- IS ALSO A GENERAL RULE TO FOR SALES TAX ALLOW -- FOR FOR EXEMPTIONS FOR CERTAIN THE SUSSEX. THIS PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WRECK RECOGNIZES THE NECESSITY NATURE OF DIAPERS MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS AND THIS PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION FROM SALES TAX -- FOR DIAPERS INTENDED -- INTENDED FOR USE BY CHILDREN AND FOR MITCHELL PRODUCTS. THE PURPOSE OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS TO MAKE CERTAIN THE SUBSIDIES FOR FAMILY MORE AFFORDABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND PARTICULARLY FOR THE NEEDIEST FAMILIES. OF THIS -- THIS EXEMPTION WOULD WOULD BE BE KEPT ON THE WOULD SUNSET AT THE END OF TWENTY A. B. EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY IT WOULD SUNSET -- DECEMBER -- THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ORDER TO ALLOW FOR THREE FOUR REVIEW TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF THE EXEMPTIONS WHETHER THE STATE HAS THE FISCAL CAPACITY TO CONTINUE THE EXEMPTIONS. OF THE COST FOR THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE ESTIMATED AT SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND. AND TWENTY IN A NINETEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND TWENTY ONE HELLO. SURF KIRSTINE LA SO -- REGARDING DIAPERS THE PROPOSED EXEMPTION WOULD PROVIDE A BROAD BUT LIMITED BENEFIT TO PARENTS ALTERNATIVES COULD PROVIDE MORE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS TO PARENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS FOR EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF PROVIDING. THE EXEMPTION FOR A ONE YEAR AND AN ESTIMATED TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL. THE STATE COULD FIND ROUGHLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED CHILD CARE ADDITIONAL CHILDCARE SLOTS. AT AND ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE LOCAL PROGRAMS AND NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO SCHOOLS THROUGH PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT OUR REGARDING MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS -- SOME HAVE RAISED IN EQUITY CONCERN REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF SALES TAX TO THESE PRODUCTS ARE ONE COULD ADDITIONALLY REYES SIMILAR EQUITY CONCERNS REGARDING. THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND SEVERAL OTHER MAJOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAL GRANTS CAL WORKS AND SS I SS P.. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDRESSING THIS EQUITY CONCERN IS A POLICY PRIORITY WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER A BROAD RANGE OF OPTIONS ACROSS THOSE PROGRAM AREAS. FINALLY REGARDING -- THE SUNSET DATES -- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THESE EXEMPTIONS WOULD LAST JUST TWO YEARS -- IN OUR VIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO ENACT THESE EXEMPTIONS. ARE SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF FOUR TO TEN YEARS STRIKES US IS MORE REASONABLE. I GIVEN THE DIFFERENT POLICY RATIONALES FOR THE TWO EXEMPTIONS THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AN EXPIRATION DATE TOWARDS THE EARLIER END OF THE RANGE FOR THE DIAPER EXEMPTION. AND TOWARDS THE LATER AND FOR THE MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS EXEMPTION. ADMINISTRATION COME A CONCLUSION TWO YEARS. VERSUS. FIVE I'M WHAT WAS RATIONALE BEHIND THE YOU KNOW THE IT'S IT'S PART OF OUR TRYING TO TRYING TO KEEP THE BUDGET RESILIENT BEING ABLE -- TO IT IT TAKES A TWO THIRDS VOTE TO REPEAL ANY ANY TAX CUT ANY -- TO RAISE TAXES AND SO -- WE'RE WE'RE DOING IT. WITHIN THE REVENUE THAT WE HAVE. IN THE MAY REVISE WE CAME UP WITH ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN THE BUDGET WINDOW BUT THEN THAT REVENUE TRAILS OFF IN THE LATER YEARS AND SO. WE WANT TO FIND AS MUCH AS WE CAN BUT WE WE WANT TO GIVE THIS THE STATE ROOM SO THAT. IF WE HAVE A RECESSION LET'S SAY IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHAT PRIORITIES -- WE WANT TO FIND IN AND WHICH ONES ARE ARE LESS IMPORTANT AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WANT. TO GIVE IT A SHORT WINDOW SO THAT WE ROOM READ -- RETAIN THE FLEXIBILITY. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. GOING UP IN A PUBLIC COMMENT. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AT COMMITTEE JEFF NEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. I ALSO HERE REPRESENTING THAT MY COLLEAGUE GENE HEARST WITH URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA. WENT TO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST -- BACK FILL FOR THE LOCAL LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS. WE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT THESE GERMAN HAVE HAVE GONE OVER -- BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT THESE EXEMPTIONS -- WOULD DIRECTLY REDUCE FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS -- SERVING MANY OF THESE SAME ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THE SALES TAXES AS YOU ALL KNOW FUNDS BOTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT -- PROP ONE SEVENTY TWO FOR PUBLIC SAFETY LOCAL TRANSPORTATION -- AND IN PARTICULAR TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT THAT WAS A HUGE SHIFT OF OF BOTH PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITY AND REVENUE FROM THE STATE TO LOCALS AND COUNTIES -- SUPPORT FOR THAT CHANGE -- THE LYNCH PIN OF THAT SUPPORT WAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION A INCLUDED IMPROPER -- THIRTY WHICH GUARANTEES A BACK FILL -- OF THOSE FUNDS WITH THE STATE REDUCES THOSE REVENUES AND WE BELIEVE THEREFORE THAT THE STATE IS OBLIGATED TO BACK FILL SPECIFICALLY FOR TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT LOSSES RELATED. TO THESE EXEMPTIONS AT MORE GENERALLY THOUGH WHILE THE STATE IS TRYING TO DECIDE. HOW TO BOTH PROVIDE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND ALSO PREPARE FOR THE INEVITABLE COMING RECESSION A THREE FOURTHS OF COUNTIES ARE MAKING THE SAME DECISIONS -- BUT WITH REVENUES THAT HAVE STILL NOT RETURNED TO PRE RECESSION LEVELS AND SO -- REDUCING THEM. A REDUCING ATTACKS THAT ACTUALLY AFFECTS LOCALS TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN IT AFFECTS THE STATE WITHOUT -- WITHOUT PROVIDING A BACK FILL IS A TROUBLING SO WE WOULD -- WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A BACK FULL FOR THE THE LOCAL LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EXEMPTIONS. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS GENOCIDE TODAY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF ALAMEDA WE'RE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THE TAX EXEMPTION FOR MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE CITY WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO EVENTUALLY FIND A PATHWAY TO ELIMINATING THE SUNSET AND MAKING THIS TAX EXEMPTION PERMANENT IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. MISTER MICHAEL WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND WE TOO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL TODAY THANK YOU. SMITH ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WE HAVE A LONG STANDING POLICY OF OPPOSING TAX EXPENDITURES OF THIS NATURE -- RECENTLY WE PARTNERED WITH THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY AS WELL AS CHILDREN ADVOCATES TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF TAX EXPENDITURES LIKE THIS AND JUST THE IN THAT COST FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE IS OVER FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TO THESE ITEMS DO ADD UP. AND SUN SETTING THEM IS QUITE IMPORTANT -- IN PARTICULAR IN SPITE OF THE VERY MERITORIOUS -- NATURE OF THESE PROPOSALS AND AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHERS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THE SURE THAT ARE QUITE MERITORIOUS. THERE ARE LIKE ADDRESSING A VERY FINE PROBLEM WITH A MALLET WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ON IT WHO ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD DIAPERS. OR TAMPONS ARE ABLE TO DO SO AND WE'RE NOT ALLOCATING FUNDING DIRECTLY TO THAT WE'RE JUST ENSURING THAT EVERYONE GETS A LITTLE BIT OF A BENEFIT WHICH MEANS AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE. WHETHER OR NOT THE ATC CAN BE EXPANDED TO COVER IMMIGRANT FAMILY FAMILIES WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE SUBSIDIZING KIM KARDASHIAN'S BABY'S DIAPERS AND SO THERE IS A QUESTION TO BE HOT ABOUT PRIORITIES HERE AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU. TO CONSIDER THAT THANK YOU. FOR TAXES TO THE BILLING WHICH OKAY -- SO -- SO THIS ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH WITH RETAILERS WHO HAVE SALES TAX COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS A SOLELY BY VIRTUE SO THEY'RE OUT OF STATE RETAILERS AND THEY HAVE A A COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS BY VIRTUE OF USING A CALIFORNIA BASED MARKET FACILITATOR. TO WAREHOUSE AND SHIP THEIR PRODUCTS -- SO IF IF HER HOW TO SEE RETAILER SELLS A GOOD THAT IS STORED IN FACILITIES LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. THE OUT OF STATE REACHED RETAILER IS REQUIRED TO COLLECT SALES AND USE TAXES. MANY THESE RETAILERS ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THEIR TAX COLLECTION REQUIREMENT SOMETIMES NOT EVEN AWARE. THAT THERE ARE GOODS ARE BEING SOARED -- AND SHIPPED FROM CALIFORNIA. CD TFA -- CALIFORNIA APARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE EFFORTS IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. TO CONTACT THESE RETAILERS AND INFORM THEM OF THEIR TAX COLLECTION DUTIES -- UNDER UNDER CURRENT LAW AT CD TFA CAN REQUIRE PAYMENT OF BACK TAXES FOR EIGHT YEARS PRIOR TO THE DATE -- THAT THEY NOTIFY THE THE RETAILER -- AB. ONE FORTY SEVEN MAKES IS NO LONGER AN ISSUE GOING FORWARD OR AFTER AFTER OCTOBER FIRST OF THIS YEAR. BECAUSE IT WILL REQUIRE MARKET PLACE FACILITATORS -- TO IT WILL SHIFT THE BURDEN OF COLLECTING TAXES TO THE MARKETPLACE TO SEOUL TATERS -- THE LC RETAILERS WILL NO LONGER HAVE THAT OBLIGATION -- SO. CURRENTLY CD TESFAYE CAN LOOK BACK EIGHT YEARS THIS PROVIDE SOME PROTECTION TO THOSE RETAILERS BY LIMITING CDT TFA. TWO THREE YEAR LOOK BACK HELLO. HOW WE HAVE TWO COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL FIRST IT WOULD CREATE A BENEFIT FOR SOME FULLY NON COME FULLY NON COMPLIANT TAXPAYERS THAT IS UNAVAILABLE TO OTHERWISE SIMILAR PARTIALLY COMPLIANT TAXPAYERS? ON ONE HAND THAT DIFFERENCE COULD RAISE SOME EQUITY CONCERNS ON THE OTHER HAND. FULLY NON COMPLIANT TAXPAYERS MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO COLLECT USE TAX. IN OUR SECOND COMMENT IS THAT THE PROPOSED BENEFIT WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO RETAILERS TO FILE OR RICH FILE RETURNS OR MAKE PAYMENTS. PRIOR TO BEING CONTACTED BY CD TFA ANY INCENTIVES CREATED BY THAT PROVISION COULD BE COMPLEX. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS ITEM. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK PRIOR I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ON LINE MERCHANTS. GUILD OF WE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN AND WHILE WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR LIMITING THE LIABILITY TO THE PAST THREE YEARS IT IS OUR VIEW THAT THIS TAX LIABILITY DOES NOT EXIST AT ALL OR SHOULD NOT EXIST AT ALL. THIS ITEM HAS A TIE INTO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AB. SEVENTEEN NINETY LET ME EXPLAIN JUST BRIEFLY. WHEN A THIRD PARTY SELLERS SIGNS UP ON -- FULFILLMENT BY AMAZON THEY CLICK THROUGH THE APPLICATION AND THEY ENGAGE IN SOME CONTRACT. NOW -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN A THIRD PARTY SELLER PROVIDES A PRODUCT TO FULFILLMENT BY AMAZON. THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MATERIAL IS GOING TO BE STORED AS WAS SAID PREVIOUSLY STATED. AND FURTHER MORE THEY WERE GIVEN NO NOTICE THAT THEY HAD ANY SALES TAX LIABILITY INSTEAD. THE CONTRACT SAYS YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR TAXES QUOTE AND QUOTE. SO I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THEY WERE NOT NOTIFIED THERE IS A COMMON MAN MADE THAT CD TFA HAD NOTIFIED FOLKS. AND WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH CD TFA AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT THAT. NOTICE WAS WANTING IN THAT FOLKS WERE NOT AWARE THROUGH EACH -- MORE -- SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS AT CETERA THAT THERE WAS EVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR A SALES TAX LIABILITY. AS TO THE LIABILITY OWED THE THE TERM RETAILER IS USED AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THESE FOLKS ARE RETAILER. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHILL WILL KNOW FROM HIS LAW SCHOOL CONTRACTS CLASS. THERE IS NO PRIVITY OF CONTRACT THE CONTRACT IS BETWEEN THE THIRD PARTY SELLER AND FULFILLMENT BY AMAZON. THEY CANNOT DICTATE THE RETURN POLICY TO THE ULTIMATE PURCHASER NOR CAN THEY HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH THAT PURCHASER. IN FACT THEY ARE EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO SO WE SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THIS IS MORE IT CAN TO IT I CAN SIGN ME AGREEMENT. IN WHICH THE SELLER IN THIS CASE FOR THE RETAILER REALLY IS AMAZON AND WHERE BY THEY ARE THE PLATFORM THERE THE CUSTOMER INTERFACE. AND THEY'RE DETERMINING THE RETURN POLICY AND OTHER THINGS. TO MS WICKS BILL HER BILL REQUIRES THAT THESE CONTRACTS BE IN PLAIN AND ORDINARY IN UNDERSTANDABLE ENGLISH AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THAT DID NOT OCCUR. SO THE EFFECT IS CORRECT THAT THERE THIS IS DISCRIMINATORY 50% OF THESE -- SO THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS ARE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. CV TFA WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO REACH THEM AND IN FACT WHEN THEY TO REACH SOMEONE WHO IS DOMESTICALLY BASED. I WILL SUBMIT TO YOU THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE NO ABILITY TO COLLECT THE TAX SO THE REVENUE ANTICIPATED BY HIS. ITEM WE THINK IS ILLUSORY AND FINALLY. I WANT -- TO BRING TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION THAT IN A RECENT A LATE APRIL EDITORIAL BY THE LA TIMES -- CITY TFA ADVICE SOME OF THESE THIRD PARTIES READ A TAILOR'S THAT THEY COULD RECOUP THEIR SALES TAX BY GOING OUT IN REACHING OUT TO THE CUSTOMERS. FIRST OF AGAIN THEY WERE ON THEIR PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER -- TWO THE IDEA THAT AFTER THREE YEARS OR ANY PERIOD OF TIME THAT A THIRD. PARTY SELLERS GOING TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO THE PURCHASER AND COLLECT THE SALES TAX IS RIDICULOUS AND WE THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO TAX LIABILITY. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU. BEFORE NEXT BIGGER SPEAKS -- JUST TO LET FOLKS KNOW FOR NEXT TIME WHEN YOU WERE TO GO OUT OF ORDER SO GONNA CALL FROM. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN JUST A HEADS UP. PLEASE RECEIVE SMITH ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION JUST WANNA KNOW THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE NO POSITION ON THIS ITEM AT THIS TIME ALTHOUGH WE WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH. CITY TFA AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN BURKE'S OFFICE WITHIN HER FOR BRINGING FORWARD -- ONE FORTY SEVEN IN THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMP OF REASONABLE COMPROMISE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

PPC AND STAKEHOLDERS. WE REALIZE THAT WILL BE IN THE MIDS OF A FILING DEADLINE AT THAT TIME AND PERHAPS A FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE DEADLINE WOULD BE. THE BEST -- THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT AT THE TIME SB THIRTEEN FORTY NINE MANDATING THE CALYX AS REPLACEMENT SYSTEM WAS PASSED THE PRIMARY WAS SCHEDULED TO BE IN JUNE WITH THE CHANGE OF THE PRIMARY TO MARCH WE WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MANDATORY FILING PERIOD. IF WE GO LIVE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO FILINGS WILL BEGIN IN THE OLD SYSTEM AND THEN WILL CONTINUE IN THE NEW SYSTEM.

THIS MAYOR REVISION PROPOSAL FOR THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SEEKS TO AMEND EXISTING GOVERNMENT CODE TO REMOVE AMBIGUITY AND ENSURE THAT BENEFITS FOR EXAMS AND EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. ALIGNS WITH THE STATE'S OTHER. AND POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS PRE FUNDING POLICIES FOR ALL STATE EMPLOYEES WITH THA I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. QUESTION WOULD BE THE IMPACT OF NOT ADOPTING THIS LANGUAGE. ABSENT THIS LANGUAGE -- THE NEW NEW EMPLOYEES HIRED INTO AN EXAM TO ARE EXCLUDED POSITION WILL FALL UNDER THE EXISTING LAW FOR THE ONE HUNDRED NINETY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION FORMULA SO RIGHT NOW IN STATUTE -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFYING EXCLUDED AND AND EXEMPTS TO THE EIGHTY EIGHTY FORMULA THAT WE ADOPTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO. NEW EXEMPTION EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES WILL NOW CONTINUE TO FALL UNDER THE ONE HUNDRED NINETY FORMULA. AS LONG AS THEY VAST AND STATE SERVICE FOR THE REQUIRED PERIOD OF TIME SO THEY'LL BE ELIGIBLE FOR HIGHER BENEFIT WHICH DOES NOT ALIGN WITH. OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU LL.

SEVERAL MONTHS IN DEALING WITH THAT NATIVE AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS OF THEIR VERY UNIQUE AND THE NATURE OF HOW THEY ARE ESTABLISHED AND HOW WE NEED TO CONDUCT OUTREACH WITH THEM -- WE'VE ALREADY PROVIDED SOME LEVEL FUNDING DIRECT APPLICATIONS TO THOSE NATIVE AMERICAN -- GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS SPECIFIC COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- TO DO DIRECT OUT REACH WE HAD ANTICIPATED THAT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE -- SOME OF OUR OTHER PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS THE COUNTIES DO SOME MORE SOME KIND OF INDIRECT OUT REACH TO THE SAME THE SAME POPULATION GROUP BUT AFTER AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WE FOUND IT WILL BE BEST IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE TWO INCH TO PROVIDE THAT -- OUT REACH DIRECTLY INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO INDIRECTLY THROUGH SOME OF OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS SO HENCE THE CHANGE OF COURSE HERE IN IN REQUESTING ADDITIONAL MONEY -- FOR NATIVE AMERICAN OUT REACHED ADDITIONALLY WERE ASKING FOR NINE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS -- TO DO TWO THINGS ONE IS TO ACQUIRE -- POLITICAL DATA EAKES -- TOOL THIS IS BASICALLY A CANVASSING TOLL THAT WE CAN UTILIZE AS WE CONDUCT -- DOOR DOOR CAMPUS SCENE DURING THAT NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP PERIOD AND SO THAT WE CAN TRACK AND COLLECT THE DATA OF THOSE LOCATIONS WHERE WE ARE -- DOING THAT OUR REGION THE COMMUNITY -- AND WE'RE ALSO ASKING FOR FUNDING FOR AN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THAT WE CAN DO THE NECESSARY STATISTICAL ANALYSIS DEVELOP SOME BASELINE MEASURES AND METRICS FOR SUCCESS RELATED TO OUR STATEWIDE OUTREACH AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT TOOL. ON THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THIS IS A REALLY A TECHNICAL CHANGE OR ASKING FOR MILLION DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY SO THAT pEXPAND FUNDING THAT COMES TO US FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THIS IS RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING POPULATION SAMPLE NUMERATION SURVEY WHICH IS PARTLY FUNDED BY BOTH THE CENSUS OFFICE AS WELL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE CENSUS OFFICES CARRYING THE CONTRACT -- BUT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES CONTRIBUTED A MILLION DOLLARS TO THAT CONTRACT AND WE NEED THE EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY IN ORDER TO EXPAND THOSE FUNDS ONCE THEY REACH OUR OFFICE -- FOR WE HAVE TO PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REQUEST -- THAT WE'RE ALSO ASKING FOR AND THE BIG ONE IS REALLY REQUESTING ADDITIONAL -- BUDGET FLEXIBILITY AND IT'S THE ONE I'M IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF TIME MINDS -- TO KIND OF LAY THE GROUNDWORK HERE AND WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF REQUESTS FROM VARIOUS -- STAKEHOLDERS OUT THERE SAYING THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE MONEY FOR CENSUS OUT REACH HOWEVER IN THE VIEW OF THE STATE AT THE MINISTRATION OF THIS TIME TIME WE CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR CENSUS OUR RATES WERE ALREADY PROVIDING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GRAND SCHEME. OF EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR SPENDING A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE CENTS TWENTY SEVENTEEN THROUGH THE SENSES PERIOD JUST ON CENSUS RELATED ACTIVITIES -- AS WE WORK THROUGH THE SUMMER WE ARE GOING TO BE HONING IN AND GETTING DOWN TO THE GROUND YOUR LEVEL ON ROUTE REACH PLANS AS WE DO THAT WILL BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU EXACTLY. WHETHER WHERE WE ARE SPENDING OUR DOLLARS WHAT TYPE OF OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WE ARE CONDUCTING IN THE COMMUNITIES WHAT POPULATION GROUPS ARE WE CONDUCTED AN OUT REACH. ACTIVITIES TO AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'VE MISSED ANYBODY OR MISSED ANYTHING AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES THAT WE EXPECT TO DO. IF OUR CONTRACTOR PARTNERS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB THEY'RE DEVELOPING GOOD CONTENT THERE USING THE CORRECT MESSENGERS -- WE MAY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW BUT IF NOT OR IF WE COME TO FIND AS WE DO OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLANS THAT WE HAVE A SHORTFALL WE MAY NEED TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND BECAUSE THE CENSUS PROCESS DOES NOT. LINE UP WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK IN REQUEST TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WE IDENTIFY THAT NEED -- SO THAT'S THAT REQUEST THAT THE LAST PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IS REALLY A TECHNICAL. LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE TO POINT THE POSITIONS AS PART OF THE CENSUS OFFICE AND CLARIFIES THAT THOSE POSITIONS -- SHOULD AND NO LATER THAN THE END OF JUNE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WITH THAT I'M.

WHY WOULD A THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD WOMAN RAISING TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN WITH HER UNDOCUMENTED HUSBAND? FILL OUT THE CENSUS WITH THERE'S A LOOMING THREAT THAT HER HUSBAND CAN BE DEPORTED. AND THEIR LIVES TOGETHER FOREVER THREATENED. WHY WOULD A REFUGEE ON IMMIGRANTS SEEKING POLITICAL ASYLUM FILL OUT THE CENSUS IF IT WILL ONLY TAKE ONE EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PUT THEM OUT OF THIS COUNTRY? THERE ARE THOUSAND THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA YOU NEED CBO'S TO MOBILIZE EDUCATE AND CONVEYANCE THESE INDIVIDUALS. INDIVIDUALS IN A COMMUNITIES WHO DIRECTLY HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN BUT A LOT TO LOSE. I'M TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY WELL EDUCATED HIGH FUNCTIONING INDIVIDUALS OF OUR SOCIETY WHO WERE INTO AN INFILL INFLUENTIAL IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE STATE NEEDS TO SPEND THIS MONEY TO EDUCATE AND CONVEYANCE. INDIVIDUALS WHO WON'T BE CONVINCED UNLESS THEY HEAR FROM THOSE DAY TRUST. WE AGREE IT IS UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF MONEY WE WILL EVER SPEND ON THE CENSUS BUT THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AND DO WE REALLY WANT TO BE IN A POSITION TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND SAY.

HAD ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THOUSAND AND DIRECT -- ALLOCATIONS TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS SO THAT THEY COULD DO OUT REACH WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL SERVICE AREA WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION. THE THE THE DIFFICULTY OF OR BECOMES IS THAT MOST OF THEM DON'T RESIDE WITHIN THEIR THE LARGE PORTIONS OF THEM DON'T LIVE ON TRIBAL LANDS ANYMORE SO THEY LIVE OFF TRIBAL LANDS OF WERE ASKING THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTUALLY DO THE OUT REACH ON THEIR TRIBAL LANDS. AND MANY OF THEM WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS ARE ON THE TRIBAL LANDS IT'S VERY LOW THAT'S WHY THEY GET THE DIRECT ALLOCATION TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IS NOT.

FROM THE UNPRECEDENTED DEVASTATION THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES. AS THE AGENDA KNOWS THE MINISTRATION PROPOSES FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS LOCATED THERE IN. FOR PROPERTY TAX LOSSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES. THIS REQUEST AUGMENTS THE THIRTY ONE POINT THREE MILLION THAT WAS PART OF THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE CAMPFIRE RECOVERY EFFORTS. THE PARADISE IRRIGATION DISTRICT HAS REQUESTED FUNDING TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS THE ADMINISTRATION WILL WORK WITH THE DISTRICT TO DETERMINE IMMEDIATE FUNDING GAPS AS A RESULT OF THE CAMPFIRE.

NEW THIS MODEL IS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE SEE THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL AS PRIMARILY A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT ON RACE ISSUES. BUT DO NOTE THAT IT RAISES HER BROADER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATE'S ROLE IN ASSISTING RECOVERING COMMUNITIES -- THE LEGISLATURE HAVE DISCRETION IN THIS AREA AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH HIS DECISION IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE DISASTERS INTO THE POLICY CHOICES INVOLVED THERE. INCLUDE WHAT TYPE OF ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE FOR WHAT DURATION AND AND WHAT AMOUNT. ON THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CAMPFIRE WILL JUST KNOW THAT THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE CURRENTLY LACKS DETAIL AND SO WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ENGAGE THE ADMINISTRATION ON THINGS LIKE. EXACTLY WHAT THE ALLOCATIONS WILL BE WHAT ARE THE SPECS SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND HOW THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS WILL BE MONITORED. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE.

STILL CONTINUING OUT OF ORDER WE'RE GONNA GO TO ISSUE NUMBER -- EIGHT CALIFORNIA'S COUNCIL DISPOSITIONS PLEASE PROCEED [inaudible] I AM. GERMAN COOPER AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SAM BROWN CRAWFORD I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL IS PRIMARILY A GRANT MAKING AGENCY WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE ACCESSIBILITY OF OUR PROGRAMS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE SENSIBILITY STATEWIDE IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE FOLLOWING STAFF WORK TARGETED REGIONAL OUTREACH WORKSHOPS COMMUNITY MEETINGS WEBINARS MONITORING THE GRANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT OF GRANT GUIDELINES CONTINUALLY EVALUATION. OF OUR WORK OUT IN THE FIELD. PANEL EDUCATION AND THE COUNCIL APPROVAL PROCESS. THE C. A. C. IS REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL POSITION AUTHORITY OF SIX POINT THREE POSITIONS. TO SUPPORT THE DISTRIBUTION OF LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS VIA OUR GRANTING PROGRAMS SINCE THE AGENCIES DEVASTATING CUTS OVER A DECADE AGO. THE C. A. C. IS BEEN FUNCTIONING AT A DEFICIT IN HUMAN RESOURCES. PRESENTLY THE C. A. C. IS BEEN OPERATING WITH A STAFF OF TWENTY THREE POINT FIVE FTP POSITIONS ADMINISTERING LOCAL ASSISTANCE TOTALING FIFTEEN POINT NINE MILLION ANNUALLY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL ON GOING TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE C. AC BUDGET IN THE FISCAL YEAR. ARGUMENT EQUATES TO A 60% INCREASE IN OUR GRANTING FUNCTIONS. WITH LOCAL ASSISTANCE AT APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX MILLION WITHOUT ADDITIONAL POSITION AUTHORITY THESE SEE AC WILL ONLY HAVE TWENTY THREE POINT FIVE FTE POSITIONS TO ADMINISTER THE TWENTY SIX MILLION. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT IT'S HELPFUL TO LOOK AT THE BUDGET AND STAFFING IN 200-012-0002 WHEN LOCAL ASSISTANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX MILLION AND WE HAD FORTY FOUR POINT SEVEN F. T.. POSITIONS. PLEASE SEE THE WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AS THE AGENCY'S BUDGET HAS INCREMENTALLY INCREASED FROM ONE MILLION TO FIFTEEN POINT NINE MILLION. AND IN AN EFFORT TO MOVE TOWARDS SERVING THE GEOGRAPHIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF THE STATE CA SEE NOW ADMINISTERS EIGHTEEN GRANT PROGRAMS. SERVING APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED ARTS ORGANIZATIONS. THESE EIGHT HUNDRED ARTS ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENT A SMALL FRACTION OF THE ELEVEN THOUSAND ARTS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALMOST. SEVENTEEN HUNDRED GRANTS WERE ADMINISTERED THIS YEAR WITH CURRENT STAFF ALREADY OVER CAPACITY. AND THAT THERE IS A NEED TO PASS ON ACCESSORY DUTIES TO COMPLETE THE KEY FUNCTIONS NECESSARY IN THE GRANT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. AND PROVIDE THE OUT REACH IT'S EXPECTED OF A STATE ARTS AGENCY. THE AGENCY HAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF APPROVED POSITIONS AND AN INCREASE BUDGETARY AUTHORITY WHICH HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED TECHNICAL ANALYTICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE NEEDS TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF AGENCIES PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE FINANCE LETTER INDICATES THAT THE C. A. C. WILL JUST TRIBUTE FIVE MILLION TO THE ARMENIAN AMERICAN MUSEUM AND FIVE MILLION TO THE LOS ANGELES MUSEUM OF THE HOLOCAUST. MAKING OUR LOCAL ASSISTANCE BUDGET THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THE 5% PROVISION IS RESTRICTED TO THE FIRST TEN MILLION DOLLARS. FOR OUR POSITIONS YOU HAVE PACKETS IN FRONT OF YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT. YOU KNOW OUR AGENCIES LOCAL ASSISTANCE. VERSES THE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS AND A CHART OF THE WORKLOAD MEASURES OVER TIME. OKAY ASSISTANCE SHE WENT INTO NIHIL COLORADO -- EIGHT NINE TOGETHER -- YOU MENTION IT GOT THOSE GRANTS GO. TO NOW THAT 60% INCREASE. IN A 60% INCREASE IN GRANTS ERA THAT THEY'LL BE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE SAME TYPES OF GRANT MAKING -- STRATEGIES THAT WE USE ALREADY. TWO LOCAL -- ARTS AGENCIES SO THAT THEY THERE IS REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ARTS AND CULTURE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EVEN IF I WERE THESE GRANTS ARE USED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I IDENTIFY THAT OUT YEAH. FIVE YOU CAN'T TODAY I MEAN I WILL IT CAN BE LIKE TO SEE WHERE. THAT MONEY IS ACTUALLY GUY WOULD LOVE ENTRIES THAT YOU WERE THE REPORTED WHERE IT'S USED TO DISADVANTAGING -- COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF OUR MISSIONS IS TO SUPPORT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GREAT [inaudible] LL. HI CHRISTINE WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC CONCERNS WE DEFINITELY CAN KERR THOUGH WITH THE STAFF COMMENT THAT -- IT WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO HAVE A B. C. P. THAT WOULD BE A PREFERRED METHOD THE SET UP PROPOSAL DIDN'T COME WITH ONE SO THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. FINANCE. CHARLIE MANNING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDED A TEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE TO THE C. AC BUDGET AND A PROVISION A CHANCE FOR UP 25%. OF THE TEN MILLION TO OPERATIONS UNFORTUNATELY POSITIONS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THAT PROPOSAL AND THE POSITIONS PROPOSES IN THE MAY REVISION ALLOW US TO UTILIZE THE ADMINISTRATION FUNDING PROVIDED WITH THE ON GOING TEN MILLION DOLLARS. SEOUL WHILE THERE WASN'T A AND B. C. P. FOR THE SIX POINT THREE POSITIONS IT IS LINKED TO THE B. C. P. PROVIDED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT A 45% INCREASE IN STAFFING HELLO KNOWS RIGHT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE I I KNOW YOU MENTIONED EARLIER SOME STAFFING SHORTAGES BUT JEFF IN A FORTY FIVE AT WE QUALIFY THAT. HOW DO WE? SO IT THIS IS SOMETHING WE THINK ABOUT CAREFULLY AS WE MOVED HER WORK THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT SEASONS OF OUR WORK. AND WE DO CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF WHERE THE STRESSORS ARE CURRENTLY IN OUR STAFF. AND HOW CAN WE ACCOMMODATE THOSE STRESSORS SO WE CAN SERVE THE FIELD IN THE BEST MANNER. WE ARE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF IT AT A TWO YEAR EVALUATION OF OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN THE FIELD OVER ALSO WE CAN. HAVE LOOK AT WHERE ARE GAPS ARE. AND WHERE OUR SUCCESSES ARE AND DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. FINANCE YOU SPEAK ON THAT ON THE OVERALL -- AS THE AND ALSO WHETHER WAS IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL. SO YEAH IT DUE TO TIMING -- OF ADDING THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE POSITIONS WERE NOT INCLUDED THE FOR THE NAY REVISION FINANCE LETTER INCLUDED FOR THESE SIX POSITIONS WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO USE THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- AND SO I GUESS IT WENT OUT ALL WE'RE TRYING TO ARTICULATE HERE'S THAT FUNCTIONALLY THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ONGOING FUNDING HAS BEEN -- JUSTIFIED THROUGH THE B. C. P. PROCESS THESE POSITIONS WILL ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY ADMINISTER THAT SO -- I AGREE I AGREE IT'S A LARGE INCREASE BUT SO IS THE TOTAL ON GOING FUNDING -- AND I THINK -- THE COMMISSION SORT OF ARTICULATED IN THE PAST WHEN IT HAD -- GRANT BECAUSE OF ABOUT TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THEIR POSITION AUTHORITY WAS MUCH HIGHER WAS ABOUT FORTY FIVE POSITIONS SO EVEN THIS IS STILL ARE LOWER THAN IN PAST. THE FROM RON POSITIONS WERE JUSTIFIED THE BEEF IN THE BCP CORRECT. YES THAT WE ARE AT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO STAFF IN THE L. L. AT A HIGHER LEVEL ABOUT WHY WE NEED THE SIX POSITIONS AND DEFINITELY NOT THAT TRADITIONAL POP BUT DEFINITELY TRYING TO PUT EVERYTHING OUT THERE THAT WE CAN TO HELP YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THE NEED. FOR THOSE SUCH RECENTLY BEEN DONE SEPARATELY KERR IS THAT ALSO CORRECT. TRADITIONALLY BEEN DONE SEPARATELY -- I CAN'T SPEAK I GUESS TRADITIONALLY TO THAT BUT AN INCREASE THE BILL BUDGET ALLOCATION SEPARATE POSITIONS. I THINK YOU I THINK. TYPICAL PRACTICE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LINK THE SIX POSITIONS IN THE JANUARY TEN PROPOSAL -- UNFORTUNATELY LIKE I SAID DUE TO TIMING ISSUES THAT CAN TAKE PLACE O -- THE NAY REVISION PART FINANCE LETTER MAKES THE REQUEST FOR THE SIX POSITIONS THAT UTILIZES THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AGAIN. APOLOGIES FOR THE SORT OF LACK OF CLARITY AND THE YOU KNOW SORT OF PROCESS VIOLATION HERE BUT ESSENTIALLY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THANK YOU. QUESTION COMMITTEE THE SERVICE AREA. YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR -- I THINK I THINK THE DIRECTOR WAS UNDER SELLING HER PROGRAM A LITTLE BIT -- BECAUSE JUST ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO WE HAD APPROVED A FUNDING I THINK BETWEEN FIVE TO EIGHT MILLION CAN'T REMEMBER NOW. THAT WENT DIRECTLY TO PRISONS AND TO HELPING WITH -- ENHANCING PART PROGRAMS AND SOME OF OUR STATE PRISONS SO UP I'D LOVE TO ALSO HERE LITTLE BIT OF THE OUTCOME OF THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HERE WAS. A GREAT SUCCESS WHEN THE PROGRAM HAD BEEN IN PLACE. UP UNTIL THE TIME BUT WHEN WE EXPANDED THE DOLLARS. SO JUST WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT I THINK -- ARTS COUNCIL HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE. THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET THAT HIT IT HAD BEEN KIND OF HELD AT OF ONLY ONE MILLION OF IT BEING GENERAL FUND AND THE REMAINING OF IT BEING FROM ANY AND THE LICENSE PROGRAM SO IT'S NICE TO SEE. THE INCREMENTAL PROGRESS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN WE CELEBRATE THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION MARKER -- SET OUT SOME TIME AGO -- AND WHILE ALSO THIS IS BEING SAID I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT -- THE FUNDING. TO THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM AS WELL AS TO THE ARMENIAN MUSEUM IS NOW BEING PLACE THAN NOT JUST THROUGH LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS BUT THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DIRECTLY AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE. OF OF NOT ONLY THE CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF THE STATE BUT ALSO OF HIGHLIGHTING. CERTAIN CULTURES -- THAT WILL BETTER RELATE TO TRAUMA AND CHALLENGES WITH THE WITH OTHER CULTURES IN CALIFORNIA -- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING. OF THIS GOING FORWARD GIVEN ESPECIALLY THE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF FINDINGS OF ARE BEING HANDLED IN A WAY WHERE. AS CONSTRUCTION OR AS PROJECT. OF BENCHMARKS ARE MET THE FUNDING IS RELEASED I'M I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT'S THE CASE I WANTED TO VERIFY. WELL -- SO WE DO NOT DIRECTLY REQUEST A TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND FOR THE CONSTRUCTION. PROJECTS IS A LITTLE OUTSIDE OF SENATE OPERATING -- PROCEDURE IT A FOR FOR ME I UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE PRIORITY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND SO IT STILL IS A LITTLE CONFUSING TO ME AT THIS POINT BUT WE'RE GETTING CLARITY AS WE MOVE ALONG. AND THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING -- OUR WORK IN THE PRISONS WE WE HAVE -- ARTS PROGRAMMING PRESENTLY AND EVERY PUBLIC. I HAVE A CELL ATTY YEAH -- FOR ADULTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THAT WE ARE PUTTING -- ARTS COUNCIL IN CONTACT WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED THIS FUNDING SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ABOUT HOW THESE -- FUNDS ARE TYPICALLY MOVE TO MUSEUMS ARE HOW THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST SO OKAY I THINK THE BENCHMARKS WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT.

STATES THAT -- THE CREATIVE ECONOMY IS SEVEN POINT 1% OF CALIFORNIA'S GROSS STATE PRODUCT THAT'S AHEAD OF AGRICULTURE AND TRANSPORTATION SO WE DEFINITELY SEE THAT THIS INVESTMENT THAT YOU MAKE IN THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AND HAVING THE ARTS BE ACCEPTABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IN OUR ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA AND IN JOBS -- I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT OPPOSE GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S LINE ITEMS FOR THE LOS ANGELES MUSEUM -- OF THE HOLOCAUST AND THE ARMENIAN AMERICAN MUSEUM. IN OUR IN SUPPORT ALL FUNDING THAT GOES TOWARDS THE ARTS WE% ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPROPRIATION GOING THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCILS BUDGET. SEE SEE DOES NOT FUND CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AND IS ACTUALLY FOR BID IN UNDER THE CURRENT REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION THIS PROPOSED PASSED THROUGH ALLOCATION IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CA SEES MISSION. THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS THE GRANT MAKING ARM OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEIR MODEL IS TO PROVIDE FOR A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS THAT IT HERE'S TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS. THE C. A. C. FUNDS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AT LEVELS FAR BELOW WHAT IS ANTICIPATED BY THESE TWO LARGE APPROPRIATIONS WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT THIS FUNDING WILL BE BE MORE PROPERLY PASSED THROUGH TO THESE MUSEUMS BE THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM GRANT PROGRAM. BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES CREATED IN TURN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN SIGNED A BEFORE YOU. TO CALIFORNIA MUSEUM GRANT PROGRAM IS AN OBJECTIVELY BETTER MECHANISM FOR EXECUTING THIS FUNDING SHOULD ALLEGE THAT LEGISLATOR VOTE TO DO SO. AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DAVID JONES ABOUT THE CITY OF GLENDALE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE ARMENIAN MUSEUM FUNDING WE THINK IT'S A OF OF IMPORTANT CULTURAL AMENITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS I SAID EARLIER THOSE ARE ITEMS. EIGHT NINE BILLS WILL BE HELD OPEN. FOR SIX OR LESS AGENDA ITEM ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN CANNABIS. THANK YOU THANK [inaudible] IS THERE. I'M ACTUALLY. YEAH. I CLING COME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HERE TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S CANNABIS TAX BOND PACKAGE -- AS APPROVED IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR EXCISE TAXES ARE LEVIED ON THE CULTIVATION AND RETAIL SALES BOTH ADULT USE A MEDICINAL CANNABIS. WITH TAX REVENUES BEING DEPOSITED INTO THE CANNABIS TAX FUND. THEY CANNABIS TAX -- CANNABIS EXCISE TAX IS FORECAST TO GENERATE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN. NINETEEN TWENTY I REDUCTION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN THE NEAR TERM REVENUE ESTIMATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE THE MARKET HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEEN ESTABLISHED. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR ALSO SPECIFY THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES IN THE CANNABIS TAX FUND. WHICH ARE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED IN PRIORITIZED AS FOLLOWS ALLOCATION. ONE GOES TO REGULATORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE CANNABIS ACT. THEY CANNABIS PACKAGE INCLUDES FIFTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ASSIST IN THE CREATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF EQUITY PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL ADMINISTER THE GRANT PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE BUREAU CANNABIS CONTROL. ALLOCATION TO GOES TO RESEARCH ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS AND THE PAST EFFECTS OF ITS CRIMINALIZATION. THE PACKAGE DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY CHANGES TO ALLOCATION TO PROGRAMS. AND THEN FINALLY ALLOCATION THREE IS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN NINETEEN TWENTY WILL HAVE EXPENDITURES MADE FROM THIS PORTION OF THE TAX FUND ALLOCATIONS. WE EXPECT THAT A HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THESE ACTIVITIES HOWEVER WE WOULD KNOW THAT THAT'LL ACTUALLY BE DEPENDENT ON THE FINAL -- TWO TAX RECEIPTS THAT ARE RECEIVED -- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO I'LL GO THROUGH AND KINDA DELINEATE THERE'S THERE'S THREE MAIN COMPONENTS THEIR 60% TO EDUCATION PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF YOU SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AND AND 20% TO SORT OF RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AND ILLEGAL. MISS CULTIVATION AND THEN PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAMS. SO THE FIRST 60% WE ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW TO BE A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THE FIRST TWELVE MILLION WILL GO TO THE PARK MAP HEALTHCARE CANNABIS SURVEILLANCE AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES. AND THEN THE REMAINING TWENTY FIVE OR 75% WHICH WE ESTIMATED EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO SUBSIDIZE CHILDCARE FOR INCOME ELIGIBLE FAMILIES TO KEEP THOSE CHILDREN OCCUPIED IN ENGAGED. IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S DISCOURAGING POTENTIAL USE OF SUBSTANCES. THE REMAINING 20% WILL GO TO TWENTY WHICH WE ESTIMATE AT TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE MILLIONTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT. YOUTH PROGRAMS IN THE AREAS OF EDUCATION PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. WITH THE REMAINING 5% OR FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY ACCESS GRANTS. FROM THE DIP A CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THESE GRANTS WILL FUND PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT. A YOUTH ACCESS TO NATURAL RESOURCES OR QUOTE AND CULTURAL RESOURCES. SO NOW WE GET INTO THE 20% WHICH WE ESTIMATE AT THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR CLEAN UP REMEDIATION ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CREATED BY A LEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION EXCUSE ME. TIMES 60% OR TWENTY NINE OR TWENTY THREE POINT NINE MILLION WILL GO TO THE PART OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. OF WHICH THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION WILL GO TO SUPPORT CLEAN AFTER MEDIATION RESTORATION EFFORTS AND TEN POINT ONE MILLION WILL GO TO ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. THE OTHER 40% -- WORK FIFTEEN POINT NINE MILLION WILL GO TO PARTS OF WHICH SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION WILL BE USED TO SURVEY THE IMPACTS AND IDENTIFY -- I KNOWN AREAS OF CANNABIS CULTIVATION TO ASSIST IN PRIORITIZING FUTURE. ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS FIVE POINT SIX MILLION PERMIT REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF CULT OF ILLEGAL CULTIVATION ACTIVITIES ON STATE PARK LAND AND THREE POINT TWO MILLION TO MAKE ROADS. AND TRAILS ACCESSIBLE FOR PEACE OFFICER PATROLLING IDENTIFICATION OF ILLEGAL ON CANNABIS CULTIVATION. AND THEN THIS TAKES US TO OUR TWENTY PERSON OUR FINAL 20% AGAIN ESTIMATED AT THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY RELATED ACTIVITIES. TWO POINT SIX MILLION WILL GO TO THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL FOR TRAINING RESEARCH AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT REALLY TO IMPAIR DRIVING. AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. THE REMAINING 30% ESTIMATED ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO AS C. H. P. FOR IMPAIRED DRIVING IN TRAFFIC SAFETY GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WILL GO TO NON PROFITS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS AUTHORIZED IN PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR AND THE REMAINING 70% ESTIMATED AT ABOUT TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO THE BOARD STATE COMMUNITY ORRECTIONS FOR COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BANNED CANNABIS CULTIVATION OR RETAIL ACTIVITIES. HELLO HEARD PRIORITIZE LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION% PROGRAMS FOR YOUTH AND TO SUPPORT COLLABORATIVE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AIMED AT COMBATING. ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION IN SALES -- AS I NOTED THESE DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE CHANGE ACTUALLY BE DEPENDENT ON THE FINAL TWO QUARTER. FINAL TWO PAYMENTS OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND FINALLY THE MAY REVISION ALSO ACTUALLY INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED. TO CAMPUS RELATED ACTIVITIES. THERE'S TECHNICAL CLEANUP RELATED TO THE CANNABIS CONTROL APPEALS PANEL STATUE. STREAMLINING PROVISIONAL LICENSE IS ENHANCING EQUITY GRANT PROGRAM AND STRENGTHENING IN A MID ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES FOR UNLICENSED CAME BACK. CANNABIS ACTIVITY AND EXTENDING THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION. THIS CONCLUDES MY LONG COMMENTS HERE AND I'LL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE SORT OF BROAD REACHING AND IF I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER I'LL GET BACK TO YOU THE U. L. L.. HOW INCREASING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE PREPARED -- SHORTHAND OUT -- IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE UNFORTUNATELY I APOLOGIZE IS PASSED OUT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE I THINK THAT SURGEONS HAVE A FEW EXTRA COPIES. I'M. OKAY GREAT -- SO I'M GONNA SKIP OVER THE FIRST TWO PAGES BECAUSE I BELIEVE THOSE WERE -- VERY WELL COVERED BY -- BY FINANCE BY -- MISTER COLLINS SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- THREE I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE'S A TABLE THAT VISUALLY SHOWS -- WHAT FINANCE EXPLAINS IN TERMS OF WHAT -- IS GOING TO BE ALLOCATED TO EACH PROGRAM EACH ALLOCATION AND HOW MUCH THE DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR EACH ALLOCATION. I'M JUST A COUPLE THINGS AS WELL TO HIGHLIGHT -- TO REINFORCE WHAT FINANCE MENTIONED -- BED ONLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ALLOCATION ONE IS THAT NOW THEY'RE PROPOSING SOME FUNDING -- THROUGH THE FEAR OF CAMPUS CONTROL TO GO BAD AS A FOREIGN EQUITY PROGRAM PREVIOUSLY THAT WAS FUNDED OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND -- YOU'LL ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR -- AS WITH SAID AS WAS STATED PROVOCATION THREE SO THIS IS AB AND IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD. FUNS THAT ARE GOING TO ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES -- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE BEGIN OUR ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION WE HIGHLIGHT A FEW FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST ISSUE WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THIS EXPENDITURE PLAN REALLY REFLECT THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES -- SO -- PROP SIXTY FOUR PROVIDED ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT OF A BRAT IN TERMS OF THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED THE ADMINISTRATION -- TO USE THESE FUNDS FOR A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES AND SO REALLY THE EXPENDITURE PLAN REFLECTS THOSE PRIORITIES -- IT'S ALSO AS WAS MENTIONED BASED ON THOSE REVENUE SO IT SAID SUBJECT TO CHANGE -- THE SECOND POINT WE WANTED TO MAKE IS THAT IN GENERAL IT DOES THE EXPENDITURE PLAN DOES SEEM CONSISTENT WITH PROP -- SIXTY FOUR WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT IN A COUPLE PLACES THERE'S THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A LACK OF CLARITY IN PROP SIXTY FOUR AND SO THERE THERE COULD BE A A LESS CERTAINTY -- AND JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THOSE ONE IS THE USE OF THAT ALLOCATION ONE FOR EQUITY PROGRAMS -- ALSO THE USE OF ALLOCATION THREE FOR CHILDCARE SLOTS THE PENDING ON HOW THAT'S DONE -- COULD BE SOME LEGAL UNCERTAINTY THERE. THE THIRD ISSUE WE WANTED TO RAISE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IS REALLY THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE -- THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THAT -- SO CLEARLY PROP SIXTY FOUR CONTINUOUSLY ALLOCATE THE FUNDS -- SO THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE ACTION TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS -- BUT THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY EXACT ON EXACTLY HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE CAN DIRECT THESE FUNDS -- SO THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF GRAY AREA. I NEXT WEEK WE DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT DESPITE THE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN DIRECTING THE FUND SPECIFICALLY. WE THINK THAT CLEARLY THE LEGISLATURE PLAYS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN OVERSEEING THESE FUNDS -- AND THIS IS IN A VERY CONSISTENT THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN GENERAL -- BUT ESPECIALLY WITH THESE FRIENDS GET ESPECIALLY GIVEN SO MUCH FLEXIBILITY WE THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE -- THEIR FEW QUESTIONS THAT WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AS A CONDUCTOR THIS OVERSIGHT ROLE -- THE FIRST IS WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED SUFFICIENT INFORMATION -- TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE MAKE -- UNDERSTAND HOW THESE FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED IN USE I'M IN SOME CASES THESE FUNDS ARE PROPOSED FOR NEW PROGRAMS IN OTHER CASES VERY. SIGNIFICANT EXPANSIONS TO EXISTING PROGRAMS SO THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA WANT TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE GOING ABOUT DOING THIS WHERE THE FUNDS ARE TO BE ALLOCATED HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO BE RUN. ON THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO -- WE THINK THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. I'M ALSO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NEW POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THESE FUNDS -- THERE WEREN'T ANY BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS -- PROVIDING DETAILS ON THESE POSITIONS THE LEGISLATURE'S JUST GONNA WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S COMFORTABLE BUT IT'S RECEIVED ENOUGH INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THESE POSITIONS WHAT THEY'LL BE DOING -- AND REALLY AND REALLY OVERSEE THOSE. IN CASES WHERE THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT HAS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION WE THINK IT'S CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE FOR THAT. LEGISLATURE TO ASK DEPARTMENTS TO COME FORWARD IN BUDGET HEARING SUCH AS THIS ONE NOT TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. THE NEXT MAJOR AREA OF FORGET WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE REALLY CAN OVERSEE IS IS ON OUTCOMES. SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER -- ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT ITS OUTCOMES WHAT OUTCOMES EXPECTS TO TO ACHIEVE -- AND WHAT ITS TARGETS ARE FOR THE USE OF THESE FUNDS THIS YEAR WE HAVE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLOCATION. THREE IN FUTURE YEARS IT COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN NOT BECAUSE IT COULD GROW OVER TIME AND SO THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT OUT OF MONEY -- WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CHEATING THE OUTCOMES THAT -- BIRD WE KNOW WHAT THE WHAT OUTCOMES WERE SHOOTING -- FOR AND THEREFORE CAN HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACHIEVING THEM -- SO AGAIN -- IN CASES WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T ADEQUATELY IDENTIFIED OUTCOME THE LEGISLATURE COULD ADOPT REPORTING LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TO PROVIDE THOSE OUTCOME MEASURES OR IT COULD PROVIDE SOME LEGISLATIVE INTENSE -- AND THEN FINALLY WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW THOSE OUTCOMES THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THOSE OUTCOMES IT'S GOING TO BE MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- AND THAT COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE SOME REPORTING LANGUAGE I THAT WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON WHERE MONIES SPENT -- WHAT OUTCOMES ARE ACHIEVED I'D SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT OVER THESE FUNDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS? THANK YOU THAT'S A QUESTION FOR FINANCE -- THE 60% THE ONE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TROUBLE IS TO DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH FOR CANNABIS SURVEILLANCE WHAT IS CAN THE SURVEILLANCE -- WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON A RESPONSE FOR STAFF TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH BUT GENERALLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH -- SORT OF I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE A REPRESENTED HERE THAT WANTS -- TO FOR RESPOND BUT GENERALLY THEY LOOK AT SORT OF METRICS IN THE COMMUNITY AND SORT OF A TAN THOSE TO MONITOR HEALTH -- FACTORS IN THE POPULATION SO THAT THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY WHERE TO INVEST EDUCATION OR ADDITIONAL TREATMENT OR PREVENTION RESOURCES SO -- I DON'T KNOW IF I KIND OF GOT THAT RIGHT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT -- YOU CAN JUMP IN IF I MISSED ANYTHING SURE SURE HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M TRICIA BLOCK WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- WE'RE REQUESTING TWELVE MILLION AND FIFTEEN POSITIONS FROM THE EDUCATION PREVENTION AND YOUTH FUND FOR SURVEILLANCE AND EDUCATION -- CANNABIS SURVEILLANCE WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY ANTICIPATED AND ON ANTICIPATED EFFECTS OF CANNABIS LEGALIZATION AND IT MAY ALSO HELP US. IDENTIFY EMERGING TRENDS THAT COULD AFFECT THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH -- WITH THE ROBUST DATA COLLECTION WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO BETTER TARGET ARE EDUCATION AND MESSAGING CAMPAIGNS. WE WOULD BE BUILDING AND DEVELOPING OUR THE ARCHITECTURE THAT WILL LINK MULTIPLE DATA SYSTEMS TOGETHER LIKE POISON CONTROL. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS EMS -- THE RETAIL MARKET PLACE AND MANY OTHERS. AT THAT SYSTEM WILL BE A HUB THAT WILL PULL THE DATA SOURCES TOGETHER AND I WE CAN IDENTIFY THE DATA IN NEAR REAL TIME -- INITIALLY WILL BE WORKING ON DATA USE AGREEMENTS AND DEVELOPING THE SOFTWARE THAT WILL LINK EACH SOURCE AND WILL ALSO BE PURCHASING QUESTIONS FROM THE ON GOING SURVEY TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US THANK YOU SO AND I I MEMORY IN THE REST OF THIS AND THE SENATE 5% IN ITS THIS IS ALL CHILDREN 35% SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. 20% NEW YOUTH PROGRAMS THE FOUR REMAINING 5% YOUTH ACCESS SO WEIRD IT'S A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE. THEY'RE DEFYING PROBLEMS WITH OUR YOUTH AND DRUG USE WITH CANNABIS. SO THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE AND THAT'S THAT'S A BIG CONCERN OF MINE -- AT ANY IS ALSO INTERESTING IF YOUR READING THIS. I'M GOING TO THE THE THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION OBVIOUSLY FOR C. H. B. -- PEOPLE DRIVING IMPAIRED -- AND THEN GRANT PROBLEMS PROGRAM FOR NONPROFITS. BUT WAS VERY INTERESTING IS A GOING TO CITIES. THAT -- LEGALIZE THERE HAVE CANNABIS SO OUT OF CALIFORNIA'S FOR IN SOME CITIES. HOW MANY CITIES LEGALIZE CANNABIS? SO YOU WERE TALKING TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS 30% OF THIS FUNDING. IS GOING TO SEE THAT LEGALIZED IT. THE FIRST AND SECOND -- COUNTY LEAST JUST TO SEE SACRAMENTO THAT LEGALIZED IT YOU'VE GOT I THINK SIX OTHER. LOCAL CITIES IN JURISDICTIONS THAT [inaudible] BENNETT SO. HOW HOW DO WE -- AND I'M WHEN I LOOK. NUMBER ONE WAS NUMBER SEASON CALIFORNIA ALLOW CANNABIS CELLS ARE CULTIVATION -- THE THE LATEST NUMBER I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS CHANGING SO IT'S A MOVING TARGET BUT I THINK I THE NUMBER OF BANDS CITIES IS AROUND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND I BELIEVE THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITY STATEWIDE SO. SO I GUESS AND AND I'M I WORKED WITH THE CANNABIS FOLKS SO WE'RE NOT AT ODDS BUT THAT'S A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY. JUST GOING TO CITIES. THAT ALLOW. CANNABIS SALES AND DISTRIBUTION. THAT'S 7% OF THAT PLOT SO SO THAT THAT. THAT REQUIREMENT WAS ACTUALLY SPECIFIED IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR THAT I HAD TO GO TO JURISDICTIONS CORRECT THAT HAVE A GRAND IT SO WE'RE JUST HEARING TELL THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE A LOT OF LEEWAY I BELIEVE I I AGREE WITH. THE LA -- WE DO HAVE -- SOME ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S A BIG ISSUE AND AND ONE THING ABOUT THE THE INDUSTRY AND SOME FOLKS ARE FROM INDUSTRY. YOU CAN SIGN ON THIS ISSUE. AND AT THE END OF THIS THE ISSUE OF ILLEGAL MARKET EMAIL AND LA I GUESS THERE. AT FOR THE AIRPORT. ILLEGAL INTERNATIONAL. THEIR SIEGES UP UNDER 66610066% FOR CANADA SMUGGLING. SO THE BLACK MARKET THE BIG ISSUE I SEE MONEY GOING TO FISHING GAME AND EVERYBODY BUT WE'RE STILL NOT TALKING THE BLACK MARKET ISSUE. AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS FOR THAT RESTORATION AND DAMAGE BUT WE KNOW THAT IN SACRAMENTO AND A LOT OF AREAS -- MUSCLES HOUSES ARE INDOOR ROSE THAT ARE OUT THERE IT'S ORGANIZED CRIME A FULL FROM BACK EAST -- USING -- IMMIGRANTS. FOR LABOR. SO AT SOME POINT THE INDUSTRY WHO ARE HERE. HAS TO COME OUT AND TAKE A STAND IF YOU YOU'RE AGAINST A BLACK MARKET BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING TAXES YOU COME OUT THE DARK AND YOU'RE DOING THAT. AND THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF BILLS WITH INDUSTRY HAS DONE NOTHING. BUT SIT ON THEIR **** ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SO SOME PLAY YOU GOT TO DECIDE. ARE YOU PART OF PALMER PA THE SOLUTION. YOU'RE STILL NOT THE BLACK MARKET THERE'S NO REASON WHY XIN SUPPORT EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE BLACK MARKET. YOU GUYS HAVEN'T DONE THAT TRIED WORKING WITH YOU AND I'M CALLING YOU OUT RIGHT NOW YOU DIDN'T YOU DON'T SQUAT. SO. YEAH YEAH. I'M NOT THIS THIS IS REAL I TALKED A BUNCH OF FOLKS OUT THERE ABOUT IT DEAL WITH THE ISSUE. YOU KNOW AND IT IS THIS IS VERONICA. ALL THIS MONIES TOWARDS OUR KIDS IN THIS ISSUE SO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER. BECAUSE SOME POINT IT'S NOT GOING TO MEET TO COME BACK AND WATCHING THE BUT ON THIS. HELLO PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS BUT YET YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT. TO YOU KNOW MAKE IT RIGHT SO -- THIS LACKEY YEAH I'VE. FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO SAY FIRST OF ALL I I FINAL CATION THREE TO BE A LITTLE BIT -- QUESTIONABLE WHEN -- SUCH A LARGE PERCENTAGE. WE'RE TREATING TO DAYCARE. I MEAN I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. THE NEXUS IS DISCOURAGING POTENTIAL USE OF CANNABIS I THINK THAT'S QUITE CREATIVE. WAS IT A LOT THIS QUESTION THOSE THAT WRITTEN IN THE PROCESS BEFORE LANGUAGE IS THAT SOMETHING POLITICIANS PUT IN THERE. NO IT WAS NOT SO YEAH. AND THAT IS 60% CAN GO TO PROGRAMS THAT EMPHASIZE EDUCATION AND PENSION EARLY INTERVENTION SCHOOL RETENTION IN TIMELY TREATS ARE TREATMENT SERVICES FOR YOUTH. THEIR FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS -- WE DEFINITELY THINK THAT THAT -- CHILD CARE INVESTMENT -- HITS THE EARLY INTERVENTION IN SCHOOL RETENTION MARKS -- AND WE DO THINK IT'S A HIGH PRIORITY NEED SO WE THINK IT FITS WITHIN THE INTENT INDEFINITELY IS AN AREA BUT LITTLE TALK HERE WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THEM. CONSUMING CANNABIS SO. THEY'RE NOT GET CONSENT IN THE CANNABIS CONSUMERS LIKE THINK IT'S AN INCREASE IN CHILDCARE I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE. DISCUSSED IN THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND THEY'RE PROBABLY MORE BETTER POSITION TO SPEAK TO THE ELEMENTS OF THOSE CONNECTIONS BUT I I DO THINK THAT -- WE BELIEVE THERE'S AN AXIS. I DON'T ALTER ANYWAYS I I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE ALONG THE LINE OF THE BIGGEST THREAT. TO THIS INDUSTRY AND TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE CLEARLY IS. WHAT -- THE CHAIR INDICATED AND THAT IS THE LIST OF MARKET. AND I SEE ROUTE I AM THANKFUL FOR THEM THE PUBLIC SAFETY ALLOTMENT [inaudible] THAT'S ATTRIBUTED HERE TOWARDS IMPAIRMENT -- BECAUSE THAT IS VERY CREDIBLE BECAUSE THAT IS A LIFE AND DEATH CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER THE LIFE OF THIS INDUSTRY. IS BASICALLY AT STAKE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF ENGAGEMENT AGAINST THE ILLICIT MARKET. AND I DON'T BLAME JUST THE THE INDUSTRY FOR THAT. THAT CHALLENGE I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK WE HAVE. THIS REALLY -- CONFUSING CIRCUMSTANCE BETWEEN WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS IT IS IT TO TAKE ON THE ILLICIT MARKET WHETHER IT'S LOCALS OR WHETHER IT'S THE STATE AND ITS WE'VE GOT THE PROVERBIAL. FINGER POINTING GOING TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND NO ONE IS DOING A DARN THING. AND IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SOME OF THIS FUNDING. TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM AGAINST ILLICIT MARKET I DON'T SEE VERY MUCH OF THAT. FOR THAT PURPOSE AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A DISSERVICE. AND I THINK IT'S MISDIRECTED. I I THINK. IT'S CLEARLY THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE TO THE SURVIVAL OF THIS -- REGULATED MARKET -- BECAUSE THE ILLICIT MARKET HAS HAD A LOT OF TIME TO BECOME VERY GOOD. AT DELIVERING THIS PRODUCT TWENTY YEARS TO BE EXACT PLUS YEARS AND NO OTHER STATE HAS HAD THIS CONDITION. AND SO WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE LARGEST POPULATION BUT WE HAVE A VERY SKILLED DELIVERY NETWORK THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY TAKING ON SERIOUSLY. AND I FIND THAT TO BE. VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING. AND I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE POTENT THAN. THIS WHERE THEY BECAUSE OF DAY CARE AND I REALLY REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO GET SOME OF THE FUNDS TO GET THE COORDINATED EFFORT TO GO AGAINST ILLICIT MARKET BECAUSE THAT IS THE THREAT AS FAR AS THE FOLKS DOING WITH LISTEN MARKET IT'S YOUR LOCAL LEVEL. IS NOT C. H. P.. IT'S NOT A LOT OF YOUR STATE AGENCIES THAT DEAL WITH THE RATIFICATION AND DEAL WITH THIS IS THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THAT RUNNING THESE FOLKS SO IT'S JUST THE PRIORITIES. IN. BUT IS THIS WONDER WHO'S DOING THIS NEWS MAKE THE PLANS OUT YEAH THERE ARE DISTRICTS SOME CONSTRAINTS WITH PROP. SIXTY FOUR WAS ON THIS OTHER PHONE FUNDING IS JUST -- MIND BOGGLING SO GO AHEAD OPEN UP PUBBLICATO MISTER NAZARIAN SORRY. THANK YOU AND I'M ACTUALLY VERY GLAD THAT I'M HEARING ALL OF THIS BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO AS IN THE IN THE CLIMB. TO OF THE BALLOT PROPOSITION -- WITH. WHETHER YOU HAVE FOLKS OPPOSING OR SUPPORTING. EVERYONE WOULD REST ASSURED THAT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH FUNDING AND REVENUE COMING IN. TO HELP SUPPORT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED TO BE SUPPORTED TO ENSURE THAT THIS MARKET IS REGULATED WELL. AND SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE LEGAL MANY YEARS AGO -- NOW THAT IT'S GONNA BE LEGALIZED AND THERE'S GONNA BE A RUSH. OF OF OF DEMAND COMING IN. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT. TO UP REGULATE AND OVERSEE AND PUT IN SYSTEMS IN PLACE QUICKLY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MEET THAT DEMAND. AND I THINK WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH THAT AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD. BUT I'M GLAD THAT THE CONVERSATION THAT COME UP ABOUT. PRIORITIZING FUNDING FOR SOME OF THE AREAS THAT -- OF WE WERE SO COMFORTABLE IN SAYING THAT. ALL THAT REST ASSURED ALL THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED -- BUT THAT WERE NOT REALLY PRIORITIZING RIGHT NOW THAT'S A THAT'S GOIG TO BE I THINK AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ONE THING I WANTED. TO GO BACK TO WAS JUST THAT THE SURVEILLANCE COMPONENT IS THERE ANY DATA THAT YOU CAN SHARE. THAT YOU'VE BEEN COLLECTING. AT LEAST IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS WE HAVE SOME SURVEY QUESTION DATA WE CAN GET DATA FROM -- POISON CONTROL THERE'S A THERE'S A NUMBER OF DATA SOURCES OUT THERE BUT WE NEED THE THE POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT DATA AND TURN IT INTO INFORMATION SO THAT -- WE CAN ACT ON IT AND PROVIDED OKAY. DO YOU BUT IF YOU'VE COLLECTED ANYTHING UP UNTIL NOW. I WINTERS DEVISE A BASE I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT HOW. HELLO. WHERE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND WHAT'S GOING ON SO I'D BE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE THAT? ONE IS WHAT THIS. ADDRESS SOMETHING MISTER YEAH I I I DON'T THINK IT WILL SATISFY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT I DO THINK -- FOR TO GET ON THE RECORD AS FAR AS AS IT RELATES TO ENFORCEMENT THAT THE CAMPUS PACKAGE DOES INCLUDE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR ENFORCEMENT RELATED ACTIVITIES IN THE RESOURCE ENVIRONMENT ALLOCATION INCLUSIVE AND THERE'S ABOUT FORTY TWO SWORN POSITIONS. AS I HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER THIS TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO THAT THE SEC GRANT PROGRAM WHICH WILL FUND YOUTH PREVENTION PROGRAMS BUT IT ALSO WILL FUND A COLLABORATIVE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- WERE ASKING TO ESTABLISH STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR THE LICENSE AUTHORITIES TO BE ABLE TO BRING ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES AGAINST UNLICENSED INDIVIDUALS WHICH DOESN'T EXIST FOR ALL THEM TODAY -- ALSO ADMINISTRATIVELY BETWEEN APRIL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY STATE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE A ROLE IN THE IN CANNABIS OVERSIGHT WILL -- WILL ARE PLANNING TO FILL A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POSITIONS FOR AND COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT RELATED. WHICH WILL BRING THE TOTAL COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT RELATED POSITIONS TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO STATEWIDE THE MUSCLES POSITIONS ARE NON SWORN CIVILIAN POSITIONS THAT DEAL WITH LICENSING. YEAH WE DON'T HAVE ANY THAT DON'T HAVE PEACE OFFICER POWERS. TO DEAL WITH THAT STUFF SAID IN THE DAYS IF YOU'RE GONNA GO AND VIGOROUSLY ATTACK IT. YOU STILL NEED SOMEBODY WITH A BADGE AND A GUN. TO TO DEAL WITH IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO THEY CAN'T SEETHINGS THEY HAVE NO POWER NO ENFORCEMENT POWERS RIGHT AT ABOUT EIGHTY OF THOSE WILL BE SOMEWHERE IN STAFF BUT WE DO HEAR YOU ON YOUR COMMENTS AND UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION ON IT. AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT MOST OF THE FUNDING PROVIDED TODAY FOR THE CANNABIS ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN LIMITED TERM. SO THERE'S GONNA BE A LARGE PROGRAM RIGHT SIZING AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. AND AND THERE MAY BE FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO ENFORCEMENT -- RESOURCES AT THAT TIME. OKAY -- GO OPEN A PUBLIC COMMENT -- AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION -- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN -- AS WELL AS THE COMMENTS BY -- MISTER LACKEY IN MISTER NAZARIAN WE WOULD ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE LOCAL -- ENFORCEMENT GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S BEING PROPOSED -- AND FUNDED AT TWENTY SIX MILLION -- WE DO BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ARE NECESSARY -- WE WOULD CERTAINLY REQUEST ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- FOR THE SAFETY ASSURANCE AND FINANCIAL ENFORCEMENT UNIT -- UNDER THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- FOR OPERATOR ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITHIN THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT UNIT WHICH IS COVERED UNDER DCA SO -- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR HAS MADE THEIR TOP PRIORITY -- ENFORCEMENT IS A REAL CONCERN FOR THE COMPLAINT INDUSTRY WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION THAT'S BEING DIRECTED TO ADDRESS ILLICIT CAMPUS CULTIVATION. BUT WE WOULD ALSO EMPHASIZE THAT -- THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ILLICIT RETAIL OPERATORS IN CALIFORNIA -- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS DIRECTED TOWARDS ILLICIT RETAIL WHICH WE BELIEVE -- IS REALLY CAUSING A pMARKET THAT JUST SIMPLY CAN'T COMPETE WITH THOSE RETAILERS SO -- ENFORCEMENT IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR US AND WE WOULD ASK FOR AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION OF FUNDS TO SUPPORT SWORN PEACE OFFICERS -- TO ADDRESS -- ILLICIT ACTIVITY THE MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN ADDITIONAL FUNDS IS THE INDUSTRY GETTING BEHIND IN SAYING WE WANT TO DO WITH THE BLACK MARKET. AND THERE -- RETAILERS HAVE DONE NOTHING THE MYSTERY IS DONE. SQUAT IT'S BEEN SEVERAL BILLS LAST YEAR THAT DEL THE BLACK MARKET. AND THEY WERE IN ABSENT SO. FACTSET AYE AYE AYE BUT DRIVERS WITH YOU GUYS IN CARE LEGISLATION AND I'M JUST TIRED OF YOU KNOW. YOU GUYS IN ON YOUR HANDS. ARE THE INDUSTRY I SHOULD SAY NOT YOU. IT BRIEFLY MISTER CHAIR -- JEFF NEAL WITH THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WHAT I THINK AB AND SUPPORT THE LANGUAGE SURPRISE ADDITIONAL CONTINUITY FOR THE LOCAL AND AND STATE -- COMMERCIAL CANNABIS LICENSING SYSTEM PARTICULAR THE EXTENSION OF THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THE ELIMINATION OF THAT TWENTY TWENTY SUNSET. IN A LICENSES THANK YOU. OKAY REAL THIS ITEM OPEN THAT CONCLUDES OUR HEARING
