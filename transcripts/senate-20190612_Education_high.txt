COME RIGHT UP I THINK YOU HAVE ITEM NUMBER. THREE AB THIRTY NINE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR [inaudible] SENATORS YES. I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO ASSEMBLY BILL. THIRTY NINE A BILL THAT -- PROPOSES SAY. BIPARTISAN ROAD MAP TO GET CALIFORNIA BACK TO WHERE WE USED TO BE. AMONG THE TOP TEN IN THE NATION. N. K. TWELVE PER PEOPLE SPENDING. I'D LIKE TO START WITH THE SIMPLE QUESTION. WHY IS CALIFORNIA THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY FORTY FOURTH IN THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE SPENDING? WE NEED TO DO BETTER THAN THAT. THIS BILL PROPOSES A ROAD MAP A PLAN ON HOW TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR ALL SCHOOL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE. THE FIRST POINT I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA. WHEN WE ADOPTED THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IN? TWENTY THIRTEEN SOME OF US WERE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE -- WHEN WE ADOPTED DEL CFF? WE ALSO ADOPTED THE FUNDING TARGETS TO GET CALIFORNIA BACK TO WHERE WE USED TO BE BEFORE THE BUDGET CUTS THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO MAKE. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. GOVERNOR BROWN PUSHED FOR THESE FUNDING TARGETS AND THESE FUNDING TARGETS PROVIDED A ROAD MAP OR BENCHMARKS BY WHICH WE MEASURE OUR PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING THESE GOALS. THANKS TO THE STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS WE'VE RESTORED THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE MET THE FUNDING TARGETS. SO NOW WE ARE PROPOSING L. C. F. F. TWO POINT NO. NOW THAT WE'VE MET OUR FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING TARGETS TO RESTORE EDUCATION FUNDING CUTS MADE DURING THE RECESSION. WE NEED TO SET A NEW GOAL BUT-NEW FUNNY TARGETS TO GET CALIFORNIA. AGAIN BACK TO WHERE WE USED TO BE IN THE TOP TEN IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. WE DID THIS BEFORE WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. I'D LIKE TO NOW TURN OVER -- AND ASK -- THE FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED SUPERINTENDENT SERRA COLLISION. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. VERY GOOD TO ME AT TWO PEOPLE TWO MINUTES EACH SOLELY DECIDE WHO THE OTHER PERSON IS PLEASE PROCEED. ERICA WEEKEND TO FRIEND TENET FULSOME CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT JUST EAST OF HERE. WE CALL ON THE LEGISLATURE TO ESTABLISH NEWS LCF TARGETS VIA A. B. THIRTY NINE AFTER THE CURRENT LCF AT FUNDING TARGETS ARE FULLY FUNDED THIS YEAR. WE SUPPORT GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S AND THE LEGISLATURE'S DEDICATION TO CONTINUALLY TO CONTINUE TO FULLY FUND THE LC FF IN. NINETEEN TWENTY CFF TARGETS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OUR REACH THIS YEAR THERE IS NO PLAN FOR HOW PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING INCREASES WILL BE ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS. ADDITIONALLY THE FORMULA WOULD ONLY PROVIDE ANNUAL COST OF LIVING INCREASES WHICH WILL COME CLOSE TO MEETING THE NEW AND GROWING MUST FIND COSTS. RELATED TO OUR PURRS AND STIRS EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS. WHICH CONTINUE TO INCREASE ADAM IN ADDITION TO OUR MANDATED SPECIAL ED COSTS IN FOLSOM CORDOVA THAT THREE POINT 26% COLA -- DOES NOT COVER THE COST OF OUR ON GOING AHEAD. STEPPING COLUMN COSTS OF ABOUT CONTRIBUTION OF ABOUT 3%. AND OUR INCREASES IN SPECIAL ED FUNDING OF OVER 12% FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AB THIRTY NINE WOULD PROVIDE A ROADMAP TO INCREASE THE LC FF BASED GRANTS AND ALSO ENSURES FUNDING INCREASES TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANTS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW. WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO DISTRICTS SUCH AS MINE WHO HAVE LARGE POPULATIONS OF POOR AND ENGLISH LEARNERS. AB THIRTY NINE KEEPS THE EXISTING LCF A FUNDING. FORMULA INTACT AND THERE ARE NO CHANGES SUGGESTED TO THE DEFINITIONS OF AND DUPLICATED STUDENTS OR COMPONENTS OF THE FRONT FUNDING FORMULA. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO ESTABLISH NEW TARGETS AND A PHASED IN TIMELINE. ESTABLISHING THESE NEW TARGETS DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE LEGISLATURE FROM ADDRESSING OTHER EDUCATIONAL ISSUES BUT IT CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE CORE ENGINE UP EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR FOLSOM CORDOVA SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS INTERVENTIONS FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND ARE AT RISK STUDENTS. MENTAL HEALTH AND COUNSELING SERVICES AND SMALLER CLASS SIZES FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS WITH OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS. ALL DISTRICTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM INCREASED INVESTMENTS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GET YOUR NEXT WITNESS WE HAVE A QUORUM SO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. LEYVA I HEAR LEYVA HERE WILK PRESIDENT WILL CARE CHIANG. CHAIN HERE THE RUSSELL RUSSELL HERE GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN. THANK YOU X. WITNESS PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LEYVA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS THE NEED TO AVERAGE KID I'M IN EDUCATION ADVOCATE. FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA REPRESENTING MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION MEMBERS. THE FF IT WITH SAID THAT UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION THE FORMULA WOULD GET CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS BACK. TO WHERE THEY WERE IN THE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE GREAT RECESSION THIS WAS A NOBLE GOAL. HOWEVER NOW THATWE HAVE REACHED ITS INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION WE NEED AN ELF FF THAT GETS CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. COMPETITIVE WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THE HARD TO THE L. CFF CHALLENGE IS THE INADEQUACY OF THE BASE FUNDING. LEVELS OF ALFIE FF IF THE ALTHEA F. TARGETS CANNOT PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR A GREAT EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN. THAN THE NOTION OF EXTRA MONEY FOR SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION IS A JOKE. AS ONE FEEL CFF BASES IN ADEQUATE SCHOOLS RECEIVING THOSE DOLLARS WILL ALWAYS BE TORTURING THE RULES OF THE EXTRA FUNDS IN ORDER TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES. OF THE BASIC SERVICES. IF WE WANT SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANTS TO TRULY LIVE THE EDUCATION EXPERIENCES OF OUR KIDS AND POVERTY ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER CHILDREN. THE BASE CANNOT BE UNDER FUND. WE CAN AND SHOULD FUND BOTH BY ESTABLISHING CONTINUED TARGETS FOR LC I FELT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. REMEMBER. HELLO IN CONCENTRATION GRANTS DON'T WORK IF THE BASIS IN ADEQUATELY FUNDED. WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PRIORITIZING LC FF MAKES A STEADY BUT IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. WITHOUT NEW TARGET TO BOO SELFIE FF BEYOND JUST COLLATE CANNOT MEET A POTENTIAL FOR BEING AN EFFECTIVE AND FAIR FORMULA FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF APPROPRIATE RESOURCES FOR EVERY CHILD. WHAT I'M HEARING FROM PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS? IS THAT BY NOT HAVING AN ADEQUATE BASE FUNDING STUDENTS ARE LOSING OUT IN SOME OF THE FOLLOWING. SOCIAL EMOTIONAL CURRICULUM AND SUPPORTS WHICH COULD BE IN THE FORM OF COUNSELORS SOCIAL WORKERS AN OUTSIDE SERVICE PROVIDERS CREDENTIAL P. E. TEACHERS FOR K. THROUGH. TWELVE MUSIC DANCE THEATER AND ARTS IN K. THROUGH TWELVE I CAN ASK YOU TO WRAP UP YOUR TIME LIMIT OKAY IT'S ONE THING. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CLASS SIZES. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE CLASSES OF THIRTY TO FOUR THIRTY TO FORTY OKAY SO I LEAVE YOU WITH TWO THUGHTS IF I COULD -- THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF ADVOCACY AND FUNDING IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCREASE THE FUNDING FOR BASIC EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO NO LESS THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL HELP STRAIGHT FROM THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO THE FUNDING. UNDER L. CFL AND TWO LCF ELF IS A MECHANISM WE USED TO DECIDE HOW MUCH DISCRETIONARY MONEY ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECEIVE FROM THE STATE. IT IS A WAY WE DECIDE HOW WE SLICE OF THE PIE IT DOES NOT MAKE THE PIE BIGGER.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SENATORS -- I AM HERE TO PRESENT AB. THREE FIVE FOUR AS A FORMER TEACHER OF THIRTY YEARS IN ACTUALLY CURRENTLY ON A LEAVE OF ABSENCE I KNOW HOW VITAL IT IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR STUDENTS TO HAVE A PROPER NUTRITION. IN ORDER TO REACH THEIR FULL ACADEMIC POTENTIALS I'M GONNA TAKE A MOMENT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE HERE JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT -- OVER THE THIRTY YEARS I TAUGHT IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS -- THERE'S A RAY OF TYPE OF LUNCH IS THAT WHETHER THE STUDENTS BRING THEIR OWN LINES OR BY LUNCH. AND SO FORTH. BUT AS THE YEARS PROGRESSED FROM MY EARLY YEARS OF BEING ABOUT TWENTY ONE AND STARTING TO TEACH TO MUCH OLDER. REALIZE YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE -- PERFORMANCE IS BASED MANY MANY TIMES ON HOW WELL OUR STUDENTS ARE DOING NOT ONLY EMOTIONALLY BUT ALSO IF THEY ARE HUNGRY THERE CERTAINLY ARE NOT GOING TO DO AS WELL SO IN A SIMPLE. WAY THIS BILL SAYS THAT ALL K. TWELVE SCHOOLS SHOULD PROVIDE AT LEAST ONE NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE SCHOOL MEAL A DAY TO ALL STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. NOW SOME SCHOOLS ACTUALLY DO THAT IN MANY DO AND SOME NOT ONLY DO ONE A MALE BUT THEY ACTUALLY DO A BREAKFAST MAIL AS WELL WE CAN GO ON TO ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION ABOUT THE NUTRITION FACTOR BUT FOR NOW WE'LL FOCUS ON THE MILLS. BUT THERE ARE SOME SCHOOLS WHO MAYBE HAVE A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF WHAT WE'D CALL TITLE ONE STUDENTS OR THAT FIT THE FREE AND REDUCED AND MANY TIMES THEY DON'T GIVE THAT MAIL TO THOSE STUDENTS EVEN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SO BUT THIS WOULD REQUIRE ALL SCHOOLS TO AGAIN PROVIDE -- THAT MALE TYPICALLY IT'S THE LUNCH TIME. MALE AND IT DOES INCLUDECHARTER SCHOOLS I DO WANNA -- MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT WE WANT TO STUDENTS NO MATTER WHAT SCHOOL THEY'RE GOING. TO TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE ONE MALE AGAIN IT MAY BE A VERY SMALL PERCENT DOES. TO HAVE A A KITCHEN DOES NOT MEAN THEY NEED TO HAVE A QUICK MEANT BUT AS WE KNOW THERE'S WAYS. TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS HAVE SOME THAT I CANNOT TELL YOU AND FULLER TEN WHICH IS CONSIDERED. A FAIRLY HIGH AND SCHOOL DISTRICT -- AND YET WE DO HAVE MANY TITLE ONE SCHOOLS BUT AT WHAT WE CALL OUR HIGHER END -- SOCIAL ECONOMICALLY I WOULD OFTEN HAVE STUDENTS COME AND ASK ME FOR A GRANOLA BAR OR WHATEVER IT WAS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY HADN'T EATEN. SO -- THAT IS WITH THIS BET BILL IS ABOUT IN WITH ME I HAVE SETH BRAMBLE WITH THE CAL CTA AND RON ARE WRAPPED CALIFORNIA CFT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER PLEASE PROCEED THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER HERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL. THREE FIVE FOUR MEMBERS LAST YEAR WE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE WITH THE HELP OF OUR AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AND PARTNERS LIKE THE PTA CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ALLIANCE AND WESTERN CENTER. ON LAW AND POVERTY -- THAT BILL ENSURE THAT CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO AT LEAST ONE FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS EACH DAY THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION BELIEVES THAT THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PARTICIPATE IN NUTRITION SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS MUST BE UNIFORM. BRAVO AND ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS INCLUDING CHARTER SCHOOLS EVERY DAY THAT SCHOOL IS IN SESSION. BECAUSE POVERTY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CHILD'S ABILITY TO LEARN AND DEPRIVE THEM OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS SHOULD WORK COOPERATIVELY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF IMPOVERISHED CHILDREN AND YOUTH WE DO SUPPORT FOOD AND FAIRNESS. FOR ALL CHILDREN ALL STUDENTS DESERVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE BASIC RESOURCES THAT SUPPORT THEIR SUCCESS INCLUDING SCHOOL MEALS. RESEARCH AND COMMON SENSE TELL US THE CHILDREN MUST BE WELL NOURISHED IN ORDER TO LEARN GROW AND ACHIEVE IT THERE. THIS BILL. BUILDS ON WHAT WE CODIFIED LAST YEAR AND I WOULD NOTE IT WAS BIPARTISAN UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR FOR THAT BILL RECOGNIZING ONE SIMPLE FACT HUNGRY STUDENTS STRUGGLE TO LEARN. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS A SIMPLE TRANSPARENCY BILL IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CHARTER SCHOOL OR COUNTY OFFICE OF EUCATION IS NOT PARTICIPATING. IN FEDERAL MIL REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS WE WANT TO PUT SOME SUNSHINE ON WHAT ALTERNATIVE MEAL PROGRAMS ARE BEING ADOPTED AS THE ASSEMBLY ANALYSIS POINTS OUT 8% OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND 74% OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM OR THE SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM WE KNOW WE HAVE A MANDATE TO PROVIDE AT LEAST ONE FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS. OUR DAY TO ELIGIBLE PUPILS BUT AS A STATE WE HAVEN'T TAEN ANY MEASURES TO MONITOR ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS AND ENSURE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AT ALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOT GOING HUNGRY. NO STUDENT SHOULD GO HUNGRY IN A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL SCHOOL MEALS ARE A CRITICAL RESOURCE FOR ALL STUDENTS IN NEED NO MATTER WHICH PUBLIC SCHOOL THEY ATTEND. WE DO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND WE ARE JUST SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL. THREE FIVE FOUR THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING RON ROUTE FROM THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE FIVE FOUR I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE -- WE KNOW THAT HUNGRY STUDENTS CANNOT LEARN TO THEIR POTENTIAL THE FEDERAL -- SCHOOL BREAKFAST AND LUNCH PROGRAMS PROVIDE NUTRITIOUS MEALS TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS IT'S CRITICAL THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FED PROPERLY. AND THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE SCHOOLS THAT OPT OUT OF THE PROGRAM ARE STILL PROVIDING NUTRITIOUS MEALS TO THE STUDENTS WHO DESERVE THEM. AND FOR THAT REASON WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MY NAME'S LORETTA ARENAS FOURTEEN YEAR TEACHER I SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. BY BURNELL DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SIR ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SIGNAL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SORRY COME RIGHT ON UP. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. HELLO HOW ARE THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT CENTER THE MAJORITY OF OUR SMALL CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM. ACTUALLY PROVIDE MEALS AND THE REASON THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM IS BECAUSE OF THE PAPERWORK. SO IT'S COUNTER INTUITIVE TO REQUIRE PAPERWORK FOR THE PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE ALREADY PROVIDING. I'M IT ACTUALLY STUDIES ACTUALLY SHOW THAT REDUCING PAPERWORK ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE MORE MEALS FOR HUNGRY CHILDREN. THE SECOND CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THE BILL -- IS THAT. THE NEW REQUIREMENT THAT YOU PROVIDE SPACE FOR FOR EATING THESE MEALS AS MOST OF YOU KNOW -- PROP THIRTY NINE THE VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVE. THAT REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PROVIDE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS AT THIS POINT IN TIME DOESN'T EVEN PROVIDE CLASSROOM SPACE FOR MOST OF OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS. SO THE IDEA THAT WE'RE NOW ASKING DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE LUNCH ROOM SPACES WELL IS A CONCERN SO THAT THEIR CONCERNS OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING THEM BACK THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU IN THE SUMMER QUIRK SILVA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD WHY APPRECIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT AND SO IS A PEDIATRICIAN I KNOW -- GOOD NUTRITION IS VERY IMPORTANT THERE ARE NATIONAL STANDARDS I'M SURE THEY'RE HELD. I APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGE ON THE SPACE BUT YOU NEED A PLACE TO EAT THE MEAL I MEAN I THINK ALL OF US WHO WORK HERE WHO SOMETIMES SELL SKIP LUNCH AND SO FORTH -- RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE BEST CIRCUMSTANCE INSTANTLY FOR STUDENTS THEY NEED TO HAVE -- SAFE APPROPRIATE PLACES BOTH EATEN BE SURE THEY HAVE APPROPRIATE MEALS AND THEIR NEEDS SO WHILE FISHY TO ME SCHOOLS MAY PROVIDE MEALS WE NEED BE SURE OF THE PROBATE STANDARD AS WELL SO -- SO I'D BE HAPPY WITH THE BILL APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SIR PAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I'M SORRY SENATE -- US SOME LIMóN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT JUST THAT THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT BUT ALSO NOTING THAT -- AS FAR AS SPACE FOR LUNCHES IN PRIVATE SETTINGS -- I VISITED SCHOOLS IN JAPAN AND THEY REGULARLY HAVE THEIR SCHOOL MILLS ACT OTHER DESK WITH THEIR TEACHER -- AND IT'S A VERY FAMILY ORIENTED ORIENTED TYPE OF EXPERIENCE SO THERE'S LOTS OF THAT OUT IN AS FAR AS PAPERWORK WE ARE IN EDUCATION ARE TO LOTS OF PAPERWORK IT'S JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPERWORK AND NOT THAT WE DON'T ACCOUNT FOR MINUTES BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF PAPERWORK AND I GUESS. WE COULD START TAKING THAT OFF BY CHANGING THAT BUT FOR THIS BILL. I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SALLY WOMAN -- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR PAN MA'AM SACRIFICE CALL THE ROLL ITEM FOR AB THREE FIVE FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. I WILL.

I PREFER TO STAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH PERFECT FOR SEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'M HERE TO THE PRESENT AB. EIGHT A ILL THAT AIM TO PLACE ONE ARE MORE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. ALL K. TO TWELVE SCHOOL CAMPUSES. THAT ESTABLISH A RACIAL OF REQUIREMENT OF ONE MENTAL HEALTH. PROFESSIONALS PER EVERY SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS WHILE GIVING SMALLER SCHOOL THE FLEXIBILITY TO FULFILL THIS REQUIREMENT. AB A REQUIRED COUNTIES TO DIRECT ONGOING PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT FUNDING. TO SCHOOLS TO BRING SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND USE WHERE THEY ARE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN'S IN CALIFORNIA. AGE FOUR TO ELEVEN HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. OVER 70% OF THEM NEVER RECEIVED ANY TREATMENT. THE PERCENTAGE SHOWN TO ME. UP 280% OR HIGHER FOR USE IN PROPERTY AND DOES -- WITH THE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING PARENTS. SO OVER THE LAST DECADE SUICIDE RATE AMONG CHILDREN SEVENTEEN AND YOUNGER HAVE INCREASED BY THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PROVIDING SERVICES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. BREAK DOWN THE BAY AREA TO ASSESS. BUT BURIED FILL SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE SO. STAFF TO PROVIDE TIME THESE SERVICES TO OUR STUDENTS. AB EIGHT WILL PROVIDE A BASELINE REQUIREMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT IN SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN'S AND USE ACROSS THE STATE. THIS BILL WOULD DO RIGHT FOR OUR CHILDREN AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT THEY NEED ON THEIR CAMPUSES. SO WHAT WAS ME HERE TODAY. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS IT IVAN.

MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE ABLE TO TO DEVELOP AND CULTIVATE. I'M REALLY STRONG AND TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH WITH YOUTH AND WITH PARENTS AND GUARDIANS -- BUT BUT SECONDLY IT'S ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY -- MEN AND ALL TOO OFTEN REFERRING -- SO YOUNG PERSON OUT TO A COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE IS INACCESSIBLE PARTS.

MAYBE SMALLER SCHOOLS ARE MORE SPREAD OUT THE ABILITY TO USE -- MECHANISMS LIKE TELEHEALTH WHICH IS WHICH HAVE BEEN TESTS NOW PEOPLE OF EXAM AND MIGHT BE A WAY -- TO TO CHEAT. THE BILL THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING THAT QUESTION NOW RECOGNIZING VIA SCHOOL SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS AT THAT RATIO YOU MAYBE IF YOU CAN GET PERSONAL SITE THAT'S GREAT BUT LAW SCHOOLS ARE SMALLER AND AND SAID AND ALSO VERY DISTANT FROM EACH OTHER SO I KNOW YOU. ALLOW ONE PERSON THE COVER MULTIPLE SCHOOLS AND WE SEE THE STRUGGLE SCHOOL NURSES TO RATE IN FACT ACTUALLY -- PRESS ANOTHER BILL SHOULD BE THE RATIO OF SCHOOL NURSES TO STUDENTS AS WELL I KNOW THAT'S BEYOND THE SCOPE OF YOUR BILL -- SO I JUST WANT TO CHECK IN ON THAT AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS IS THAT -- YEAH I I DO SHARE THE CONCERN OF THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THIS AND I REALIZE THIS WASN'T BY YOUR REGIONAL BILL I THINK THIS WAS PUT ON YOUR BILL LATER ON WAS USING THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT MONEY.

THIRD THING IS A RAZA CENTER WILK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SIX YEARS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS AS WE HAD TO TAKE THE LOW BID.

THREE SIXTY NINE PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY WELCOME. GOOD MORNING A TEACHER LEYVA AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB THREE SIX NINE A BILL RELATING TO THE STRUCTURE OF SALARIES FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SUPPORT STAFF. EVIDENTLY STRONG EVIDENCE STRONGLY SUGGESTS TO SEE ISSUE IS THE ONLY CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCY THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE SALARY STEPS TO IT'S ME IT'S STAFF. THIS CREATES AN INVERSION SOURS WERE NEW HIRES ARE EARNING MORE THAN EXPERIENCE EMPLOYEES. FOLLOWING THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX IMPASSE ON CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS. THIS ISSUE BOARD OF TRUSTEES UNILATERALLY ELIMINATED EXISTING EMPLOYEES OUR STEPS INCREASING INCREASES TIES TO JOB PERFORMANCE AND LONGEVITY. THIS HAS RESULTED IN NEW HIRES EARNING HIGHER SALARY THAT EXISTING EMPLOYER. IN THE SAME CLASSIFICATION FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IN EQUITY HAS CREATED A NINETY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN VERSION GAP. BETWEEN THE SALARIES OF NEWLY HIRED AND LONG EMPLOYED IN A CSU STAFF. WHILE DEALING WITH THE RESULTS OF THE INVERSION WILL BE NECESSARY THIS PARTICULAR BILL ONLY SIX TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING STRUCTURAL PROBLEM CONTRIBUTING TO THE INVERSION AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT IT FROM GETTING WORSE. BUT TWO DECADES THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO REINSTATE SALARY STEPS DESPITE THE FAILURE THE FAILURE OF THE EXISTING SALAS STRUCTURE AND THE INABILITY OF EMPLOYEES EARN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAIT. AB THREE SIX NINE WILL INSTITUTE WE WILL REINSTATE A 5% SALARY STEP FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SUPPORT STAFF. THIS INCREASE WILL BE MADE ANNUALLY WHEN EMPLOYEES MEET THE STANDARDS WAS SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE AS DETERMINED BY THE EMPLOYEES SUPERVISOR. WITH ME TODAY TO GO TO SUPPORT AB THREE SIX NINE IS MATT MASON A TEAMSTER MEMBER AND THE SUPERVISING ADULT. EQUIPMENT MET MIKE MECHANIC AT SAKS STATE.

I'VE SUPPORTED MY WILL CO WORKERS UNION STORE FOR TWELVE AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE TEAMSTERS LOCAL TWENTY TEN WHICH REPRESENTS ALL SKILLED TRADE WORKERS ACROSS THE CSU SYSTEM. MERRITT STEP INCREASES ARE THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO MAKE A FAIR WAGE ADVANCE THROUGH MY PAY RANGE. MY WAGES ARE LIMITED BY MY TRADE AS A MECHANIC AND FOR EXAMPLE I CANNOT INVEST ANOTHER LIFETIME TO LEARN HOW TO BECOME ELECTRIFYING OR A LOCKSMITH. THE I HAVE MOVED UP TO THE TOP POSITION MY TRADE BY SUPERVISOR AND I KNOW WE DO PROGRESS THROUGH THE SALARY RANGE. WHEN IT DID BECOME A SUPERVISOR I WAS LIMITED IN MY PAY BY A DIRECTOR WHO SAID I COULDN'T MAKE MORE MONEY THAN THE PLUMBER OR A PAINTER -- I'VE DEDICATED ALMOST TWO DECADES OF MY LIFE TO SEX STATE AND THERE IS NO REWARD FOR WORKING HARD. IN RANGE PROGRESSION. FOR ALL MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS HERE AT THE C. ISSUE ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND DENIED YEAR AFTER YEAR -- IN A VOICE BEEN BASED ON FINANCIAL REASONS OR THEY JUST CAN'T START GIVING RAISES TO ONE PERSON THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE IT TO EVERYBODY -- AFTER MARRIAGE STEP INCREASES WERE DISAPPEARED WE STARTED SEEKING AN INVERSION WE STARTED SEEING AN INVERSION PROBLEM AT OUR CAMPUS. AND I HAVE A THREE YEAR AUTO MECHANICS MAKING AS MUCH PRINT. AND BUILDING SERVICE ENGINEERS WHO RETIRED AFTER TWENTY FOUR YEARS ARE NOW MAKING THE SAME WAGE AS THEIR REPLACEMENT WAS HIRED AT THIS IS NOT THE WAY THE SYSTEM'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS AND BEING EQUAL IN COMPETITIVE. WITH THE REST OF THE CIVIL SERVICE WORKERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA EVERY AGENCY IN DEPARTMENT HAS STEP INCREASES EXCEPT US SO PLEASE HELP US IN THIS UNFAIRNESS. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. AMY HEINZ PSYCH WITH THE UNIVERSITY PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL IN PLACE YOU W. A LOCAL NINETY ONE NINETEEN IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THIRTY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL GOOD MORNING PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY TWO MINUTES EACH. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALLEN SEES HIM HE'S ALREADY MAN RIGHT WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THE CSU OPPOSES THIS BILL FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST WE HAVE HEARD THE BILL FRAMED AS A MEANS OF ASSISTING OUR LOWEST WAGE WORKERS. AND ADDRESSING SALARY INVERSIONS. IN REALITY THE STAFF WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL GO BEYOND OUR LOWEST PAID EMPLOYEES SUCH AS GROUNDSKEEPERS AND CUSTODIANS. TO INCLUDE ARE HIGHLY HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES SUCH AS ACCOUNTANTS ENGINEERS AND IT PERSONNEL. FOR THE MORE THE BILL WOULD INCREASE THE SALARIES OF ALL STAFF AT THE SAME RATE ANNUALLY. THE EFFECT WOULD BE TO PERPETUATE AND COMPOUND ANY SALARY INEQUITIES THAT MAY EXIST AS A RESULT OF INVERSION IT FOR COMPRESSION. SECONDLY THE COST IMPACTS OF THE BILL ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WHILE THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT ANY EXPENSES. FOR THIS BILL. WOULDCOME AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER POLICY PRIORITIES SUCH AS THE HIRING OF TENURE FACULTY OR STUDENT SUCCESS. WE ESTIMATE THE COST TO BE SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION IN THE FIRST YOU'RE GOING TO ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. FINALLY THE IN PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON WE OPPOSE THE BILL IS IT UNDERMINES OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. THIS IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN AS OUR THREE YEAR CONTRACTS WE CURRENTLY HAVE WITH OUR BARGAINING UNITS EXPIRE IN THE NEXT YEAR. THE BILL SO THE DANGERS PRESIDENT UNDERMINES THE EFFORTS OF OUR BOARD TO NEGOTIATE FAIR COMPENSATION WITHIN THE FISCAL REALITIES OF OUR FUNDING NOT ONLY WAS CSU REVIEW. BUT WITH ALL OTHER BARGAINING UNITS AS WELL WITH ME TODAY IS JOHN'S WERE BACK THIS UC'S ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR OF LABOR AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS AND OUR LEAD NEGOTIATOR. TO DISCUSS THE FURTHER IMPLICATIONS OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED MORNING. SO THERE WAS A REASON WHY THE BOARD MOVED FROM THE STEPPING CREASES TO OPEN RANGES AND THAT WAS BECAUSE THE STATE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT IT FUNDED THE CSU. UP UNTIL THAT POINT OUR FUNDING WAS DERIVED LARGELY FROM A SERIES OF FORMULAS. AND THAT WAS KNOWN AS ORANGE BOOK FUNDING. AND AS PART OF THAT PROCESS THESE -- INDIVIDUAL SALARY INCREASES. I RIGHTLY BY THE STATE SO IT WAS A LINE ITEM IN OUR BUDGET. DURING ONE OF THE RECESSIONS IN THE NINETIES THE STATE. DECIDED THAT THE CENTURY THE CSU WOULD JUST RECEIVE A BLOCK OF MONEY AND WE DON'T HAVE TO ALLOCATE HOW WE SPEND THAT MONEY BASED ON OUR COMPETING PRIORITIES. SO WITHIN THAT CONTEXT IT WAS CONSIDERED BY POLICY TO BE -- GUARANTEEING SALARY INCREASES WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY CONCURRENT GUARANTEE AS TO FUTURE REVENUES. SO WE MOVED TO AN OPEN RANGE SYSTEM. AND THE RATIONALE FOR THAT MOVE IS AS RELEVANT TODAY AS IT WAS THEN -- I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM DURING THE RECESSION WHEN WE RECEIVE THE COLD TELLING US THAT WE HAD TO BE CHIU SOUGHT BUDGET BY FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE THE START OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. WHICH WAS A MATTER OF A FEW WEEKS AWAY. AND EVEN WITH WHAT I RECALL WITH THE LARGEST TUITION INCREASES AND SEE ISSUES HISTORY -- WE STILL HAD TO TAKE OTHER EXTRAORDINARY MATCHES I WAS THE PERSON NEGOTIATED THE FELLOWS I OVER SO MANY LAYOFFS WE HAD TO DO. AND EVEN WITH ALL OF THOSE MEASURES IN PLACE THERE WAS STILL. A CLEAR REDUCTION IN OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF SERVICES WHICH WE ASPIRE TO PROVIDE TO OUR STUDENTS. SO TO THAT. MOST OF THE STAFF EMPLOYEES ENDED UP GOING SIX SHE IS WITHOUT SALARY INCREASES -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WAS A GREAT BURDEN ON THEM. HI AND AS THE ECONOMY IS PICKED UP WE DID TAKEN. SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO TRY AND ADDRESS THE RESIDUAL EFFECTS OF THAT PERIOD. WITH VERY DIFFERENT TO THE STATE AGENCY IS MOST OF THE STATE AGENCIES THE GOVERNOR WILL NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNITS. THEY'LL AGREE SALARY AND THEN THE BUDGET WILL BE ALLOCATED TO TO MEET THAT NEED. WITH AS WE GET A LUMP OF MONEY AND THEN WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE OUR SALARIES WITH OUR UNIONS. AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THE MONEY WE RECEIVE WILL COVER OUR ALL OUR PRIORITIES -- WHICH ARE OFTEN COMPETING ON OLD ME T MISSION CRITICAL YOUR TIME IS UP SO IF YOU CAN WRITE A SEVEN ABOUT ONE ADDRESS A VISION VERY QUICKLY. ONE THING THAT HAS ME MENTION THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF INVASION IN THE CSU IS NOT EXTERNAL HIRES ITS INTERNAL HIGHS -- WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHICH GIVES PRIORITY FOR HIGHER TO EXISTING EMPLOYEES WE'VE RECENTLY AGREED TO ANYONE MEETING MINIMAL QUALIFICATIONS GETS INTERVIEWED -- WE HAVE THE VISION THE CPA THAT SAYS THAT IF SOMEBODY MOVES TO BACK HIGHER CLASSIFICATION. TO HAVE A SALARY SET UP 5% ABOVE THE CURRENT SALARY. SO IF YOU RUN A DATE TO REPORT TO THE INDIVIDUAL WILL LOOK LIKE CAN YOU HIGHER INTO THE CLASSIFICATION. I WILL NOT REFLECT THE FIGHT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS SAID THIS IN A DIFFERENT CLASS. SO IN VERSION IS NOT JUST THE CASE OF LOCAL MARKETS BEING SET IT'S BY AND LARGE A CREATURE OF OUR INTERNAL PRACTICES TO INCREASE SOCIAL MOBILITY AMONGST OUR STAFF EMPLOYEES. VERY GOOD THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. BEFORE I GO TO THE COMMITTEE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM AND WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR TEN YEARS AND YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN WORKING FOR THREE YEARS AND THEY MAKE THE SAME OR VERY CLOSE TO IT. IT CREATES A HUGE MORALE PROBLEM AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AS YOUR INTERNAL STRUCTURE PROVENCHER INTERNAL STRUCTURE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD FIX. SO I'M JUST MAKING THAT COMMENT -- AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT FOR MANY YEARS AND SAW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU HIRED SOMEONE AND THEY CAME IN THEY WERE MAKING CLOTHES OR THE SAME AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR TEN OR TWENTY YEARS. CREATES A HUGE MORAL PROBLEM IT DOESN'T SHOW YOUR EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE STAYED WITH YOU AND BEEN THERE BEEN LOYAL WORKERS -- THAT YOU VALUE THEM SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THAT'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT OR I THINK YOU WILL CONTINUE JUST. LIKE THIS UNTIL WE SEE PARITY WITH ADAM AND OPEN IT UP TO THE THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. CASING AND HEARING NONE ASSEMBLY WOMAN WHICH I TO CLOSE RIGHT I WANT I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO CAME TODAY FOR THIS PARTICULAR -- PRESENTATION YOU KNOW I HAVE THE THE GOOD FORTUNE I GUESS AND AND AS SOMETIMES THE SAME CHALLENGE OF HAVING WORKED FOR C. ISSUE FOR FORTY YEARS AS A FACULTY MEMBER. AND AS A CHAIR OF A DEPARTMENT AND I WAS THERE WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE NOT ONLY DID IT HAPPEN TO THIS GROUP BUT IT HAPPENED TO OTHER GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO NEGOTIATE AND GET THERE'S BACK OF THIS REMAINS A FINAL GROUP THAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE BEARD INCREASE THIS IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC INCREASE. A THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE YOU MARRIED AND YOU HAVE TO BE EVALUATED IN ORDER TO GET IT AND IT ONLY HAPPENS IF THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. SO IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC ACROSS THE BOARD REYES -- IS PRETTY MUCH SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO HERE IN THIS HOUSE WHEN WE EVALUATE OUR OUR CURRENT STAFF -- WE MAY GIVE THEM 5% OR 10% ADDITIONAL BECAUSE OF WHAT THE WHAT THE MARKET IS DOING BUT ALSO WITH THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE HOUSE AND THAT IS ON TOP OF THE 2% OF 3% RAISE A WHATEVER THAT'S THE THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT -- THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DOES NOT FACILITATE THE KIND OF MORALE THAT WE TALK A OUT I KNOW PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN THERE. SINCE NINETY SIX AND WHO ARE STILL. IN WITH THE SAME SALARY AND THE INVERSION PIECE THAT'S THERE -- THREE SIXTY TWO RETURNS POLICY THAT WE HAD TO PAY EMPLOYEES AND AT THE SAME WAY WE DO IT MANY OF OUR MANAGEMENT WE GET THE MERIT INCREASES 1020%. OFTENTIMES TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPUS IS THAT OF THE I. WHY TO KEEP THEM EMPLOYED JUST LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB AND TO MERIT IT. THE 5% INCREASE IS ON PAR WITH OTHER SEE ISSUE STAFF -- THAT WAS THERE NINETY SIX AND IS IN LINE WITH OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES IN TERMS OF WHAT AMERICA INCREASE WOULD BE BUT IT IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC INCREASE IT IS A MERIT INCREASE. AND AS CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT I HAD TO EVALUATE MY STAFF. AND A AND A GREAT RECOMMEND WHAT THE NOT THEY WOULD GET MARRIED INCREASES THOSE WITH A WIN NINETY SIX UNFORTUNATELY. AGAIN THESE ARE AS I SAID THEY WILL BE THEY WILL BE MARRIED THEY WOULD NOT BE AUTOMATIC -- SEE ISSUE HAS UNILATERALLY ELIMINATED THIS MERIT BASED STEP SO INCREASES OUTSIDE OF THE BARGAINING PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WE OFTEN HEAR THE ARGUMENTS THIS SHOULD BE DONE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IT WAS TAKEN AWAY OUTSIDE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AND IT HAS AN AND DESPITE THE EFFORTS TO TRY TO WORK TO BRING IT BACK DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS HOUSE. THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY IN THE LAST YEAR SO PASSED THIS BILL UNANIMOUSLY IN THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT BASICALLY EMPHASIS -- KIND OF REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT HEY YOU. TO PAY ATTENTION. TO THIS IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT THREE YEARS THEY STILL HAVE NOT TAKEN THE ISSUE UP AND THEY'VE NOT DONE IT AND IT'S NOT LIKELY BASED ON THE CONVERSATION WE HEAR THAT THEY WILL TAKE IT UP AGAIN. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE AND IT REQUIRES AN EXTRAORDINARY MEASURE NORMALLY AS A SAID I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WAS A PART OF THE FACULTY WOULD CF. WHEN THE CFA AND OTHERS GOT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AND WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BUT THIS IS A SITUATION THAT IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY AND THEY HAVE STRUGGLE TO TRY TO DO IT IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING? AND HAS NOT BEEN AN APPETITE ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO THAT AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SHOULD GO IN THAT WAY THE GOVERNOR HAS COSTLY MADE REFERENCE TO IT WE HAVE MADE REFERENCE TO IT AND IT HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN UP. SO AFTER THREE YEARS WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A STEP AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FOR US AND HAVE BEEN DE VALUED IN THIS PROCESS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK S. WHAT I VOTE FOR AB. THREE SIX NINE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN DO WE HAVE A MOTION. THANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY AS A SENATOR TO RAZA PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM SIXTY THREE SIXTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. LEYVA I WILL HI WILK HI CHIANG LASSELL WHO WRESTLE AYE GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN. BELIEVE THAT BILL OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OUT ON THANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN. ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY MEN MEDINA I THINK I SEE YOU DOWN THERE COME ON ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB. FOR TWENTY EIGHT PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. YOUR GUIDE SPECIAL. pMEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. FOUR TWENTY EIGHT AB FOR TWENTY EIGHT WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED FUNDING FOR THE EQUALIZATION. OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL SERVICES AND FOR HIGH COST PLACEMENTS. OUR STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS DESERVE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. BUT OUR CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING SYSTEM PRESENTS BARRIERS WERE THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES HAVE VARIED CONSIDERABLY WITHOUT ANY RATIONALE. SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THESE INEQUITIES FOR NEARLY FOUR DECADES. AND ADDRESSING THEM IS A SIMPLE MATTER OF FAIRNESS [inaudible] THE IN TWENTY STATE BUDGET IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TO FIND PRESCHOOLERS WITH DISABILITIES WHICH IS GREAT PROGRESS. BUT CURRENT FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION ALSO PRESENTS A BERRIER AGAIN WHERE THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITY. FINALLY THE BILL PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WITH MORE SEVERE DISABILITIES. WHEN OUR CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED WE HAD SUPPORT? BUT IT WAS ELIMINATED DURING THE RECESSION. LEAVING SCHOOLS WITH NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT HIGHER CLASS PLACEMENTS. ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS BILL ARE COMMONSENSE INVESTMENTS IN FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY FOR VALUED STUDENTS. WITH ME TODAY IS MORE RAIN O'LEARY BURNESS CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE TASK FORCE ON SPECIAL EDUCATION AND DOCTOR SERRA COLLEGIAN SUPERINTENDENT OF THE FOLSOM. CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GOOD MORNING TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH I'LL LET YOU DECIDE TO START. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ENOUGH FOR THIS BILL AND THANK YOU CHAIR AND AND MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- IT I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATEWIDE SPECIAL A TASK FORCE. IN. A TO PROVIDE SOME -- A SENSE OF THE TIMELINE ABOUT SPECIAL AND FUNDING OVER TIME. SO THE STATE WIDE TASK FORCE WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHICH WAS THE SAME YEAR THAT LCF OUT BEGIN ITS FUNDING ABOUT EQUALIZING GENERAL EDUCATION COSTS. SO WE SPENT OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS DOING RESEARCH HAVING PUBLIC INPUT WORKING WITH OVER FIFTY PEOPLE INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE LEGISLATURE. IN MADE MULTIPLE RECOMMENDATIONS ESPECIALLY INCLUDING ARE RELEVANT TODAY FISCAL RECOMMENDATIONS. SOARED TO MOST IMPORTANT FISCAL RECOMMENDATIONS WERE. EQUALIZATION OF FUNDING ACROSS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND IMPROVING THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL FUNDING WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH NON EXISTANT. SO IT BEFORE TWENTY EIGHT DOES ADDRESS THESE WITH A PLAN TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES. I LOOKED AT THE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL THAT WAS DONE ACT EXCELLENTLY IN AND IT DOES INCLUDE SOME OF THE HISTORY OF SPECIAL ED FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WAS THE YEAR THAT EDUCATION FOR THE HANDICAPPED ACT WAS PASSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA AT THAT POINT SAID HOW DO WE WHAT HOW DO WE DO THIS AND HOW DO WE FUND IT. ESTABLISH SYLLABUS AND IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE FUNDING RATE AT THAT. S. DISTRICTS WHAT DID YOU SPEND LAST YEAR ON YOUR SPECIAL ED AND THAT'S HOW THEY DETERMINE THE RATES FOR THE FUTURE. SO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING INEQUITIES IN FUNDING HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE I AM A OF HIRED A BRAND NEW TEACHER AND SERRA MAY HAVE HAD A THIRTY FIVE YEAR TEACHER. SO THAT THE COSTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. THEN THAT THOSE DIFFERENCES BECAME EXACERBATED OVERTIME BECAUSE COAL ON A HUNDRED THOUSAND IS DIFFERENT THAN COAL ON TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SO THAT LED TO AB SIX SO TWO WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND WE WENT TO A FUNDING ON A K.. TWELVE K. TWELVE JUST FY I YOU'RE EATING INTO YOUR COLLEAGUES TIME SORRY. OKAY SO THE THE INTENT LANGUAGE IN AB SIX OH TWO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS THAT IT WAS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO EQUALIZE SPECIAL ED PROGRAM FUNDING IMBALANCES ENDS. TO EQUALIZE PER PUPIL FUNDING SO WE HAVE THIS HISTORY OF OUR LEGISLATUREWANTING TO DO THAT. THE RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN MEANT SPECIAL IT HAS NOT HAD ANY FUNDING ADDED TO IT WALL LCF OPPOSE FUNDED GENERAL AD. SO WE'VE HAD MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS NO FUNDING WELL WE'VE HAD INCREASES IN OUR SPECIAL THAT NUMBERS. GOOD THANK YOU HAVE A BETTER. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING AGAIN. CHAIRPERSON HI LEYVA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MEMBERS MY NAME IS SERRA COLLEGIAN SUPERINTENDENT FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THANK YOU FOR IT HEARING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND HOW IT IMPACTS DISTRICTS SUCH AS MINE. FOLSOM CORDOVA HAS OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND OF THAT ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED IN MY BUDGET WE HAVE EXPENSES OF ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT FIFTY FIVE MILLION ARE DISTRICT CONTRIBUTES ABOUT THAT STATE WITH THE CURRENT FUNDING STRUCTURE COVERS ABOUT 20%. OF OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES FOLSOM CORDOVA HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH AUTISM THIS IS BEEN A TREND STATEWIDE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT STUDENTS WITH AUTISM MADE UP 8% OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. IN THIS LAST YEAR STUDENTS WITH AUTISM MADE UP 17% OF OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ALTHOUGH AUTISM FALLS ON THE SPECTRUM MANY OF OUR STUDENTS WITH AUTISM HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NEEDS. AND THEY REQUIRE MORE SERVICES AND THEN STUDENTS WITH MILD DISABILITIES. FOLSOM CORDOVA HAS ALSO SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER STUDENTS REQUIRING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE NUMBER STUDENTS. EDUCATIONALLY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THEIR IP HAS GROWN MORE THAN 6100%. MANY OF THESE STUDENTS REQUIRES SPECIALIZED PLACEMENT SECOND COST ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY THOUSAND TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR AND MORE FOR RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT. FOLSOM CORDOVA SPECIAL AT FUNDING RATE IS FIVE HUNDRED SIX DOLLARS PER ADA THERE ARE MANY CELL BECAUSE I GET MEANT MUCH MORE THAN WE DO AS HIGH AS NINE HUNDRED PER ADA. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS PROVIDED ONLY CALL IS ON SPECIAL ED FUNDING OUR LOCAL CONTRIBUTION INCREASES ANNUALLY AT ABOUT 12% WHAT WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE NINETEEN TWENTY STATE BUDGET LEVELING UP WITH SPECIAL ED FUNDING BASE RATES TO THE STATE WIDE TARGET -- THIS WILL ONLY INCREASE OUR RATE BY FIFTY DOLLARS PER ADA SO MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE STILL WE STILL NEED A BEFORE TWENTY EIGHT TO PROVIDE EQUITY AND SPECIAL AND FUNDING TO THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.

AND AND I SHARE WITH -- DOCTOR PAN THAT IT IS BEYOND TIME THAT WE DO WHAT'S FAIR FOR A SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM SEVEN A. B. FOR TWENTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. LEYVA AYE WILK WILK I CHIANG RUSSELL RUSSELL AYE GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN AND I BELIEVE THAT BILL OPEN OR THAT OPENED THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS AT ON THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER. I SEE ASSEMBLY WOMAN CAN SALAS COME ON DOWN. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER NINE AB. FIVE HUNDRED PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. MR HANDS GONNA GET TIRED OF ME THIS MORNING -- SHOCKINGLY OF ANOTHER BILL FOR WORKERS -- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES DO NOT HAVE PAID PREGNANCY LEAVE IF A FEMALE EMPLOYEES TO GET PREGNANT HAS COMPLICATIONS DUE TO PREGNANCY MISCARRIAGE. FIRST SHE MUST FIRST USE HER SICK AND VACATION LEAVE IF HE HAS ANY AFTER THAT LEAVE IS EXHAUSTED THEN SHE MAY GET DIFFERENTIAL PAY WHICH IS HER PAY MINUS THE COST FOR SUBSTITUTE TEACHER. FOR UP TO FIVE MONTHS IN A WORKFORCE THAT IS OVER 70% FEMALE CURRENT LAW DISCRIMINATES AGAINST WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO HAVE CHILDREN YOUNG WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE PUT A POSITION WHERE THEY MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN SCHEDULING PREGNANCIES BASED ON THE ACADEMIC YEAR CALENDAR. WAITING YEARS HAVE CHILDREN TILL THEY SAVED ENOUGH SICK LEAVE ARE TEMPTING TO SURVIVE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PAY. SCHOOLS AND ME COLLEGES CAN HELP INSURE EMPLOYEES ARE INCENTIVIZE TO REMAIN IN THE PROFESSION ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY'VE HAD CHILDREN BY INVESTING IN NECESSARY BENEFITS AND MAKE IT LESS BURDENSOME FOR YOUNG WOMEN TO START A FAMILY. STUDENTS CANNOT RECEIVE THE BEST EDUCATION POSSIBLE OF OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CANNOT ATTRACT AND RETAIN GREAT TEACHERS AB FIVE HUNDRED WOULD ENSURE. THAT'S POSSIBLE BY SIMPLY RQUIRING SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS INCOMMUNICADO JUST PROVIDE THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH AT LEAST SIX WEEKS OF PAID PREGNANCY LEAVE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MANAGER MEMBERS BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA-FEDERATION OF TEACHERS -- ACCORDING TO LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE SOON IF THEY WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT TEACHER SHORTAGE -- YOUNG PEOPLE AREN'T SIMPLY BEING DRAWN INTO THIS PROFESSION -- BY LARGE ONE OF THE MAIN FACT OF THAT IS THE LACK OF BENEFITS. AND EVEN WHEN TEACHERS ARE HIGHER SCHOOL STRUGGLE TO RETAIN THEM. WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS STUDENTS AND IMPOSES ADDITIONAL COST -- ON THE DISTRICTS. I WANT TO MENTION HIS COMMITTEE THAT MEXICO HAS BETTER PAID LEAVE. POLICY THAT HOUSE THEY OFFER TWELVE WEEKS. BULGARIA ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH PROVIDES FORTY SIX WEEKS. AND OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT A NATIONAL PARENTAL LEAVE. I PAID POLICY INCLUDES FLY DYLAN'S. Là SOTO AND POP AND GETTING -- BUT I DO HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS LAST YEAR. NEW YORK TEACHERS IN NEW YORK GOT SOME GOOD NEWS AS THEY IMPLEMENTED A POLICY TO PROVIDE SIX WEEKS. OF FULLY PAID LEAVE FOR THEIR TEACHERS. WE CAN BE NEXT BY ROGER HAVE OPEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS AND SUPPORT. STEPHANIE GOLDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSORS THIS BILL BECAUSE THIS IS ULTIMATELY AN ISSUE OF EQUITY. THE MOTHER HAD PENALTY IS REAL STUDIES SHOW THAT PAID MATERNITY LEAVE REDUCES TURNOVER. AND WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO RETURN TO WORK IF THEY HAVE THAT HOWEVER A RECENT STUDY BY THE BRIGHT HORIZONS FOUND THAT 41% OF EMPLOYED AMERICANS PERCEIVE WORKING MOMS AS LESS DEVOTED. MORE THAN A THIRD JUDGE THEM FOR NEEDING A FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE AND THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WORRIED ABOUT TELLING THEIR BOSSES ABOUT PREGNANCY HAS GONE FROM 12% IN TWO THOUSAND AND 14221% IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE MOTHER HAD PENALTY EVEN FOLLOWS WOMEN OF ALL THE WAY TO RETIREMENT THE CASTERS DEFINED BENEFIT PROGRAM ALLOWS WOMEN'S. CLOTHES FOR THE CONVERSION OF UNUSED SICK LEAVE INTO SERVICE CREDITS AT RETIREMENT. THIS MEANS THAT WOMEN WHO GIVE BIRTH AND HAVE TO USE UP ALL OF THEIR SICK LEAVE. HAVE LESS WHEN THEY GO TO RETIREMENT PUTTING THEM AT A DISTINCT DISADVANTAGE TO MEN WHO ALREADY DISPROPORTIONATELY RETIRE WITH MORE SERVICE CREDITS THAN WOMEN. EVEN THOUGH THEY MAKE UP A FRACTION OF THE TEACHING POPULATION. ULTIMATELY PAID MATERNITY LEAVE AS AN EQUITY OF ISSUE THAT IMPACTS THE ENTIRE FAMILY. AND SHOULD REFLECT THE VALUES OF OUR STATE. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RACHEL WALLACE WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. AMY HI JAKE WITH THE UNIVERSITY PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL EMPLOYEES THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA LOCAL NINETY ONE NINETEEN IN STRONG SUPPORT. MICHELLE CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLACEMENTS ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO YOUR STRONG SUPPORT.

THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT FOR ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL COME ON DOWN. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY GOOD MORNING SERRA BY JUSTIN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS THERE'S A HAND ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED WE WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HER COMMITMENT TO FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR FAMILY LEAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A WITH. THE WELL BEING OF OUR FUTURE STUDENTS AND HEALTH OF OUR WORKFORCE AB FIVE HUNDRED SETS UP A NEW BENEFIT WITHOUT ANY STATE FUNDING OR SUPPORT TO A COMEDY FULL PAY FOR EMPLOYEES ON LEAVE. FOR A MINIMUM OF SIX WEEKS WE DO NOT HAVE A CURRENT SYSTEM BUILT INTO HER SCHOOL BUDGETS TO RECOGNIZE THIS NEW BENEFIT WHICH WOULD REQUIRE ELLIE A STERN THREE TO RACK LIMITED RESOURCES FROM STUDENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THIS AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE MUCH PUBLIC ATTENTION ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT CAP AND INCREASING RECRUITMENT IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION. TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE THAT THE STATE CONSIDER REQUIRING PARTICIPATION STATE DISABILITY PROGRAM AS IT IS AN EXISTING SERVICE AND SYSTEM THAT WOULD REQUIRE LESS A MINISTRY TO BURN AND TO MANAGE. AB FIVE HUNDRED ALSO DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO ADDRESS HOW LEDS WILL DELIVER EDUCATIONAL SERVICES GIVEN THAT WE WILL NEED TO THEIR HAND ON LONG TERM SUBSTITUTES WHICH IS IN HIGH DEMAND. AT THIS TIME WITH PEEPS THE LARGEST STAFFING SHORTAGE AT ALL LEVELS FROM TEACHERS TO SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS AND WE ASK THE STATE INSTEAD TO CONSIDER BUILDING UPON THE EXISTING CITY PROGRAM THROUGH THE SD I PROGRAM. INSTEAD OF CREATING A NEW UNFUNDED SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS BAREBACK WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION I JUST REALLY WOULD LIKE TO APPRECIATE THAT THE THE AUTHOR BREAKING THIS BILL AS A HUSBAND TO A TEACHER -- TEACHER FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS THAT TWO SMALL KIDS THOUGH THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT SMALL ANYMORE -- THIS WOULD HAVE PROVIDED A BIG BENEFIT FOR US NO DOUBT ABSOLUTELY WITH THAT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING THAT THE SPOKE SUPPORTERS HAVE SAID. OUR ISSUES AGAIN RELATED TO THE FISCAL MATTERS -- THE PROPOSAL'S NOT NECESSARILY A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM BUT WHAT IT DOES IT BRINGS THE CONVERSATION TO THE TABLE WHICH IS NECESSARY. NO DISAGREEMENT WITH THAT. THE THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T PROVIDE THE SOLUTION. THE SOLUTION IS RATHER -- I'M SORRY THE PROPOSAL SIMPLY JUST ADDS TO MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE EXISTING IN TERMS OF MANAGING THEIR BUDGETS AND DEALING WITH THE DEMANDS THAT THEY CURRENTLY EXIST. A SOLUTION PROVIDE THE FUNDING SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE EXISTING PROBLEMS THAT THEY FACE TODAY. IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE HEARD EARLIER AB -- THIRTY NINE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ACHIEVE JUST SIMPLY THE BASIC SERVICES THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING. FOR ABSENT FUNDING THE PROPOSAL IS BEST LEFT TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE LABOR PARTNERSHIP AND WHAT COURSE OF ACTION TO ADDRESS THE SOPHIE'S CHOICE DECISIONS THAT THEY NOT MUST MAKE. THE SCHOOLS ARE SEE FULL AND FAIR FUNDING WHICH WE WERE ALL ARGUING. FOR AT ITS MOST LIKELY WE'RE NOT EVEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION TODAY FRANKLY IT'S PROBABLY THE THE WE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE PROBABLY CELEBRATING MANY THINGS LIKE. A SMALL CLASS SIZES COUNSELORS RESOURCE SPECIALIST MORE FUNDING FOR TEACHERS THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF BUT THAT'S NOT WILL WORK HAVING CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT. THE SCHOOLS RECEIVE THAT FUNDING -- INSTEAD WOULD BE SO I'M SORRY UNTIL WE RECEIVE -- THAT LEVEL OF FUNDING OR IF -- THIS BILL IS. PROVIDES A SOLUTION WHICH INCLUDES FUNDING -- WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MICHAEL SIZER ON BEHALF OF THE KERN COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IN THE FORTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CURRENT ALSO IN OPPOSITION REGRETFULLY. MELANIE I CANNOT ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS ACCESS LIABILITY FUND IN OPPOSE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. JEFF BOCK ON BEHALF OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR SET BROWN BUT HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING OUT OF ORDER WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT. WELCOME TO THE PARTY. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I APOLOGIZE TO ITS STILL ARE STRAND FLOOR AS WITH CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING MEN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SENATOR PAN. SENATOR TORONTO. YEAH THANK YOU AND I KNOW STAFF POSITIONS STEPPED AWAY BUT BUT YEAH I GUESS. IN MY MIND A AND AND STAND THAT AND SCHOOLS THAT -- THAT ACTUALLY. IT'S THE TEACHERS. WHO'D BE SEEN LEAVE WHO ARE ALSO THE PRIMARY EFFECTUATE ERRORS I MEAN THERE TO TO DIRECT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S HOW WE EDUCATORS I AT THAT TRUE I MEAN THAT. YES RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THIS IS SOS TO ME. THIS BILL IS ALSO ABOUT THE SHARING THAT THE WORK FORCE SEISMIC TRACKING ADDITIONAL WORKFORCE EXISTING WORKFORCE NOW APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION ABOUT YOUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- YOU KNOW THE FUTURE SHINS I TEND TO SEE OUT FAMILIES AFTER THEY HAVE THEIR CHILDREN -- ME I THINK THAT -- WE'VE SEEN A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF DATA AND RESEARCH SHOWING THE BENEFIT OF LEAVE FOR THE CHILD BUT ALSO FOR THE FAMILY OVERALL. AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING. TO SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE WHO ACTUALLY HAS TO DO THE WORK OF TEACHING OUR KIDS -- THIS WOULD TO ME BE A GOOD IDEA SO I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES THAT. YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ON THE FISCAL SIDE BUT ULTIMATELY. PART OF WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY ON IS TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THAT KIND OF WORK FORCE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY PRODUCE THE RESULTS WE WANT. AND SUPPORTING THAT WORKFORCE TO BE. IN A WAY THAT -- WE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH SHOWED THE BENEFIT WOULD MAKE SEEM TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IT'S A REASONABLE INVESTMENT OF EVEN EXISTING DOLLARS WE CAN TALK WE SHOULD WE CAN ALWAYS TALK. DOLLARS BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE HAVE TO WAIT ESPECIALLY IN THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO PASS. THE HAVE THE HIGHEST PER PUPIL SPENDING WE SHOULD DO MORE FOR NOT YOU KNOW COMPARED TO OTHER STATES BUT STILL. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS ABOUT. THE USER PAN PLEASE PROCEED. THEY ARE WATCHES THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION [inaudible] SURE [inaudible] THANK YOU. BUT HASBRO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUT THAT WE DISTRIBUTE IT WE WANTED TO LAY OUT ALL THE BENEFITS THAT WE CURRENTLY PROVIDE WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED ON OUR LETTER ABOUT. THIS IS NOW AN ADDITIONAL NEW BENEFIT PROP BEFORE WE UTILIZE ALL THE SERVICE SAYS -- BEFORE UP WE TAP INTO ALL THE OTHER BENEFITS AND SO FOR US IT'S WE COULD POTENTIALLY SEE EMPLOYEES GOING FROM. IF SOMEONE STEPS OUT IN SEPTEMBER REALLY GOING ALL THROUGH THE ACADEMIC YEAR CURRENTLY AND SO THIS NEW BENEFIT IS PROVIDED TO ANYONE BE IT A NEW EMPLOYEE CERTIFICATE ARE CLASSIFIED. DOES NOT MATTER HOW MANY SIX HOURS THEY HAVE BANKER VACATION AND SO FOR US WE HAVE TO BE VERY JUDICIOUS OF HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT FACING A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE LONG TERM SUBSTITUTE FACT PRIOR FOR ONE UNDER ALL SEE ABOUT. THAT WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE BASIC SERVICES THE CREDENTIALS STAFF AND THE NECESSARY SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE. UP PROVIDED AND SO FOR US WE WANTED TO LAY OUT THAT WE CURRENTLY UNDER THE SYSTEM DECADES OF TWELVE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THEY DO BENEFIT HAVING ALL OF THE SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO PROPERLY TAKE THEIR LEAVE AND THAT WE ALSO IN ADDITION SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEGOTIATE WITH EACH OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND SO WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS LOOK AT THE STATE DISABILITY PROGRAM IT'S ALREADY IN EXISTENCE. LET'S NOT CREATE SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN BILLED FOR FINANCE SPORT SO THAT ADDITIONAL MINIMUM SIX WEEKS THE YELLOW. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ANY MONEY. FOR THE STARTING WHEN THIS BILL TAKES EFFECT JANUARY FIRST WE WOULD HAVE A DEFICIT IN OUR BUDGETS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IT THANK YOU CENTER PAN. YEAH GET NOW JUST I GUESS TO ME YET THE ALTERNATIVE IS YOU SAID OKAY I UNDERSTAND CHALLENGE OF A LONG TERM SUBSTITUTE AND PERHAPS. ACTUALLY SHORTENS OF TO TRY MORE OF AN ISSUE A LONG TERM -- ACTUALLY CONSEILS RELATIONSHIP OF THE CLASS -- ME NO LONGER REALLY TRULY BE A SUBSTITUTE IN SOME SENSES BUT I THINK ALTERNATIVE YOU'RE SAYING IS A TEACHER WHO [inaudible] TO HELD. TWO IS TRYING TO BALANCE THAT CHILD TRYING TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THAT CHILD. INSTEAD WE'RE GONNA SAY IS THERE TO ONCE YOU HAVE TO BE IN CLASSROOM WHILE THEY'RE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT HOW TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN. THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THAT'S A BETTER ALTERNATIVE. IT'S ACTUALLY JUST TO BE THERE IT'S PREGNANCY THE NOT OCCUR PREGNANCY LEAST RIGHT IT'S IN SOME WAYS I MEAN IT DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT BUT IT'S EVEN I THINK FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT. MORE OFFENSIVE THAT YOU CAN'T -- TAKE A MEDICAL LEAVE WHEN YOU HAVE A TOUGH PREGNANCY NOT EVERYBODY TO I NEVER TO PREGNANCY LEAVE I HAVE YOU KNOW -- AT C. SECTION AND ENDED UP STARTING -- PAID FAMILY LEAVE RIGHT AFTER BUT IT'S YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY IS BED BOUND WHEN THEY HAVE A HOST OF COMPLICATIONS -- THEY HAVE TO USE UP ALL THEIR SICK TIME THEIR VACATION TIME AND THE PAID DEFERENTIAL BASICALLY PAY FOR THEIR OWN SUBSTITUTE IN ORDER TO TAKE THAT TIME TO HAVE A MEAN OF COURSE SOME POINT THAT CAN BE FOR RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'VE HEARD SOME STORIES ABOUT THAT AS WELL. OKAY. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO. HELP MY GUESS SOMEONE OF THOSE THAT'S SURPRISED. SHOT. ACTUALLY -- TO HEAR THAT THERE IS NOT -- PAID. OF PREGNANCY LEAVE THAT THAT'S QUITE SURPRISING TO ME. IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A CONVERSATION FROM DECADES AGO -- THAT WAS TAKING PLACE I DON'T TAKE LIGHTLY THE FISCAL ISSUES AND AND AND CHALLENGES THAT. ARE OUR SCHOOLS I HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO BALANCE THINGS OUT BUT THIS IS SOME THIS IS NOT A LUXURY ITEM. THIS IS A VERY BASIC OVER DO ISSUE. THAT [inaudible] WOMEN. WORK FOR THE OF THE DISTRICTS SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT. TO I ALSO SEE IS A PAY EQUITY ISSUE. UP TO SAY THAT. WOMEN. BECAUSE ONLY WOMEN WE'RE GONNA GET PREGNANT -- IN WORD NARROWED IT DOWN TO THAT -- WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR VACATION AND SICK LEAVE. IS ANOTHER QUITE -- IF THE PAY EQUITY ISSUE WE WILL NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE VACATION WILL NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE HERE THERE WHATEVER YOU MIGHT NEED FOR SICK LEAVE SO SOME [inaudible] I AM. I CAN'T. IMAGINE NOT SUPPORTING THIS THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU SENATOR TO RUSSELL ANY OTHER CAUGHT QUESTION. IT IS ALREADY BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CHIANG AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY WOMAN WOULD YOU KNOW AM I IT CARRY THIS LAST YEAR WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN AND I JUST RECENTLY. LEARNED HOW WE'VE GOTTEN TO THIS POSITION. IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE OF COURSE KEYCHAIN AND AND EVEN FACULTY MEMBERS WAS A LARGELY WOMEN PROFESSION. AND THE ORIGINAL FIGHT WAS WHETHER OR NOT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO TEACH WHEN THEY WERE SHOWN AS PREGNANT. I'M SO WHILE THEY WERE FIGHTING THAT FIGHT WE WERE PROVIDING A BASIS FOR OTHER WOMEN OUTSIDE THAT PROFESSION TO GAIN OTHER RIGHTS SO. AN EQUAL KIND OF FIGHT MOVING FORWARD -- AND THERE WAS A BELIEF THAT YOU JUST SHOULD HAVE YOUR BABY DURING THE SUMMER. YOU KNOW -- WHEN A WOMAN IS PREGNANT AND SHE HAS TO TAKE SICK LEAVE BECAUSE PREGNANCY LEAVE WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE HER WHEN SHE HAS A NEWBORN? RIGHT I MEAN THE REASON WE HAVE SICK LEAVE IT IS SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF NOT ONLY OURSELVES BUT OUR CHILDREN YOU'RE PUTTING THEM IN A POSITION THAT EVEN IF WE SAID OKAY FINE. WE'RE GOING TO JOIN THE SD I PROGRAM WE'RE GONNA JOIN THE THE PROGRAM THAT IS EIGHTY ONE POINT PAYCHECK DEDUCTION FOR EVERY TEACHER THAT ARE ACTUALLY TELLING TEACHERS YOU NEED TO TAKE -- EIGHT EIGHT PAY DECREASE IN ORDER TO PART TO BE PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT BY THE WAY IS ONLY GOING TO PAY YOU 60% OF YOUR SALARY YOU'RE STILL AT IT AT A DEFICIT. SO I THINK IN A A PROFESSION THAT IS OVERWHELMINGLY WOMEN THAT IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER ONE REASON WOMEN LEAVE THE TEACHING -- FIELD IT HAS TO DO WITH FAMILY CHOICE RIGHT. IT ACTUALLY I WOULD ARGUE IN THE LONG RUN IT'S GOING TO SAVE SCHOOLS MONEY TO MAINTAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR TEACHERS AND HAVE THAT TEACHER COME BACK AS AN EXPERIENCED TEACHER THAN SAY ONCE I GET PREGNANT IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT TO CONTINUE IN THIS FIELD. SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE TOTAL COST OF TO TOTAL COST TO THE TO THE STUDENTS OF COURSE TO THE TEACHERS TO THE PROFESSION AND WE THE TOTAL VALUE OF THAT WE PLACE ON TEACHERS I THINK WE ALL I WOULD HOPE WE ALL BELIEVE TEACHERS ARE UNDERPAID. AND AND TO SUGGEST THAT THE SOLUTION IS TO TAKE WAY MORE THEIR SALARY I THINK IS IS SHORT SIGHTED AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT INCOME REPLACEMENT MORE TALKING ABOUT LEAVE WHETHER IT'S PREGNANCY LEAVE OR WHAT WHETHER IT'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S SOMETHING I'M. WORKING ON A DIFFERENT BILL BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE WE START WITH TEACHERS AND TEACHING PROFESSIONALS AND AND AN ANCILLARY STAFF AT A SCHOOL. BOARD THAT AT LEAST THEY ARE PROTECTED DURING PREGNANCY. THANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CHIANG MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM NINE AB FIVE HUNDRED THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. AYE LEYVA AYE WILK WILK AYE CHIANG CHIANG AYE LASSELL WHO DOES SO I GLAZER REQUIRE PAN. PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU. THAT IS ITEM FIFTEEN A. B.. NINE FORTY THREE PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CAN MORNING CENTER -- FOR SOME JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH US ON THIS BILL -- THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT WELL KNOWS THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS CENTERS FACE IN OUR STUDENTS. WHO ARE BARELY GETTING BY WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK WHILE THIS LEGISLATURE HAS HELPED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH TUITION THE PRICE OF EDUCATION GOES FAR BEYOND THAT? TO HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND BOOKS. WE ALL KNOW THAT IF AN UNFORESEEN FINANCIAL ISSUE COMES UP A STUDENT GETS AFFECTED A MEDICAL EMERGENCY A FAMILY MEMBER PASSES AWAY. THEY MAY BE. OUT. A SURVEY THIS YEAR FIFTY SEVEN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOUND THAT HALF OF ALL STUDENTS ARE FOOD INSECURE. 60% OR HOUSING AND SECURE ONE IN FIVE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ANOTHER SURVEY A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS FOUND ONE IN FIVE UNABLE TO AFFORD EVEN ONE MORE DOLLAR IN UNEXPECTED COSTS. WHILE MOST STUDENTS WHO WITHDRAW INTEND TO RETURN ONLY 38% ACTUALLY DO SO AND WE NEED TO HELP STUDENTS FROM WITH TRIED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ESTABLISH EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS AND EMERGING PRACTICE. TO PROVIDE STUDENTS A SHORT TERM RELIEF TO HELP STAND ROLLED IN SCHOOLS. A RECENT REVIEW OF EMERGENCY AID PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOUND THAT 95% OF STUDENTS RECEIVED THIS AID FINISH THEIR TERM. 80% WERE ENROLLED IN THE NEXT SEMESTER THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW CAMPUSES TO USE EXISTING FUNDS TO FUND SMALL GRANTS TO STUDENTS AND FINANCIAL EMERGENCIES. OR AT RISK OF DROPPING OUT AND I WOULD THINK THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FACULTIES ACROSS THE STATE STUDENTS AND OTHER EDUCATION ADVOCATES FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WILL TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEDURE TWO MINUTES. HELLO YES -- MY NAME IS DANNY TERRIBLE I AM WITH THE STUDENTS AND I FOR CALIFORNIA. THE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- I WON FIRST KNOWLEDGE THE GREAT WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE TO LOOK AT FINANCIAL AID REFORM AND TO LOOK AT COVERING THE TOTAL COST OF TUITION. I'M YOU KNOW TEXT BOOKS TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING -- BUT THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY WOULD GIVE STUDENTS. ACCESS TO EMERGING REAL THE EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDS IN CASE OF UNFORESEEN HARDSHIPS -- TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR INSTANCE THIS -- THIS YEAR WE'VE SEEN THE BUTTE CAMPFIRE IT DISPLAYS A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS STUDENTS CANNOT GO TO CLASS -- AND WHEN NATURAL DISASTERS LIKE THAT HAPPEN -- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STILL KEEP IN CONTACT WITH THE STUDENTS TO GET THEM BACK AND AFTER -- THIS IS THE RESULT -- BUT FINANCIAL AID IN ITSELF IS NOT ENOUGH TO COVER AND PROVIDE STABILITY FOR THAT STUDENT AND SO GIVING THIS ESTABLISHING THIS MARGINALLY RELIEF FUND -- WOULD STABILITY -- ANOTHER EXAMPLE LAST. TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS ABLE TO HEAR TESTIMONY FROM A STUDENT WHO DO WHO. TALKED ABOUT HOW HER FATHER HAD PASSED AWAY -- SOMEONE WHO PROVIDE THE MAIN INCOME FOR THE AND SO NOW THAT STUDENT IS IN A CATCH TWENTY TWO OF TRYING. TO SUPPORT HERSELF AND HER FAMILY. BUT CAN'T DO THAT UNLESS SHE HAS AN EDUCATION. AND SO WITH THIS BILL I WOULD REALLY PROVIDE -- ASSISTANCE FOR THE STUDENTS TO CONTINUE ON WITH THEIR EDUCATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. STEPHANIE GOLDMAN WITH THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE'VE SEEN MULTIPLE SURVEYS COME OUT OVER THE PAST YEAR SAID THAT SHOWS ALMOST HALF OF OUR STUDENTS FACE FOOD AND SECURITY -- AS WELL AS HOW IS IT HOUSING AND SECURITY. AB NINE FOUR THREE WOULD HELP BATTLE THESE ISSUES BY ALLOWING DISTRICTS TO USE STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM FUND TO PROVIDE THE STUDENTS WITH EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THAT FUNDS NOT PROGRAM IS TO HELP REFILL CHANCES VISION THE FOR SUCCESS BY ELIMINATING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. FOR STUDENTS FROM TRADITIONALLY UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS THOSE ARE OFTEN THE STUDENTS OF THE GREATEST FINANCIAL NEED. TO ENSURE THIS POPULATION SUCCESSES STUDENTS PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS MUST BE MET THAT'S FOOD THAT'S HOUSING. AND EIGHTY NINE FOR THREE WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE DISTRICTS THE TOOLS TO HELP ASSIST THOSE STUDENTS AND EMERGENCIES. GOOD TWO MINUTES TO IT. BUT SINCE SHE DIDN'T USE ALL YOUR TIME YOU HAVE THIRTY SECONDS. THANK YOU BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE PROP CO SPONSORS OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION.
