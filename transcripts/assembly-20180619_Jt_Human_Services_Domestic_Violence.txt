BROCADED A LOS ANGELES. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN WE NEED TO BALLOTS FOR HOSTING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TODAY AND THANK YOU. TO THE MEMBER I'LL. SO I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. A WHERE WOULD STAR IN TALKING ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND AND I WAS REMINDED. OF A MEDIUM I WAS OUT WITH WOMEN'S HEALTH RIGHTS AND JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS. WHERE WE WERE HAVING A MEETING AND WHERE? THE U. WELL THE DUMPSTER FIRES% THAT WE NEED TO PUT OUT. AND I BOTH HAVE STATE HOW LUCKY WE WERE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA -- AND HOW WE HAVE THESE GREAT LAWS ON THE BOOKS. BUT IN THOSE LAWS AND THOSE MARKERS SOMETIMES THAT GETS LOS AT THE HELP TO BEAR HEALTH DISPARITIES IN HEALTH INEQUITIES PARTICULARLY OF WOMEN OF COLOR. AND LOW INCOME WOMEN AND I WANT TO SPEND THAT TIME MY TIME WITH YOU ABA A FEW MINUTES TODAY TALKING ABOUT. THAT THAT INTERSECTION OF WHERE LOW INCOME WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. ARE ARE LOST IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE CONVERSATION. SO I ACTUALLY REVERSED. MY MY SPEECH TODAY AIR COMPOSITION SOMEONE OF THAT WITH THE MICROS GO TO START WITH THE MEADOW BUT I A SPLIT UP INTO. THREE AREAS WAS THE MICRO MESO AND MACRO SO THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL AIR TO ALL THE WAY TO OUR KIND OF OF BECOME CULTURAL SOCIETY. OF MOON LEGAL ABOUT THE OF MICRO LEVEL ARE THE MOST AND OVER THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ARE THEN PUT IT WORK OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. I WAS THINKING ABOUT OF MY BEST WHO IS IN A TV RELATIONSHIP? AND IN THE MIDST OF THE BREAKUP HER EX BOYFRIEND HAD CAME INTO A PLACE TRUSTED PLAYS THROUGHOUT ALL OF HER CLOTHES. CHESTER TV DAMAGE* BAD THROUGHOUT HER MATCH AS IT WAS AS SHE ADDED SENSUALLY REBUILT HER LIVE. WE WERE BOTH IN COLLEGE NEITHER OF US HAD A LOT OF EXTRA MONEY. AND SEE ESSENTIALLY NOW NEEDED TO REBUILD HER LIFE. SHE ALSO COULD NOT AFFORD TO MOVE OUT OF HER RENT CONTROLLED APARTMENT. AND HER CHILD WHO WAS GOING TO SCHOOL IN THIS AREA AS SHE DID WANT TO TAKE HIM OUT OF SCHOOL. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND ALL THE THINGS IN HURDLES THAT SHE NEEDED TO GO THROUGH IN TERMS OF REBUILDING HER LIFE PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO MOVE. HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO READ BY YOUR ENTIRE WARDROBE HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS FOR FOOD HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS FOR ALL THE LITTLE THINGS THAT -- WE TAKE FOR GRANTED WHERE. AND CONVERSATIONS AROUND AND WE TELL FOLKS WILL WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE -- LAW WE ALSO TALK ABOUT EMERGENCY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FOR EMERGENCY HOUSING ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE TO PROVIDE THEIR LOOK OF INCOME LEVELS ARE OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE LEFT BEHIND. ARE WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEAVE HURRY. THE FOLKS NEEDED IT ARE IN THINKING ABOUT HOW FOLKS NEED ACCESS TO CLOTHING MEDICAL CARE AND FOOD WE ALSO NEED TO THINK OF HOW WE'RE AND HAVE LESS ON AN AUDIENCE [inaudible] ARE -- HARVARD AND PROCESS IN TERMS OF FOR SURVIVORS WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING RESTRAINING ORDERS. AND THEN -- IN APPROVING THE HISTORY OF ABUSE WHICH IS OFTEN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO GET SERVICE SAYS. I NEW AND THEN ALSO SPEAKING ABOUT OUR MANDATE REPORTERS YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR DOCTORS AND NURSES AND GIVING THEM MORE OPTIONS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY HAVE TO MANDATE. OF WHEN THEY SEE ABUSE CAN THEY HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE NOT ACTUALLY HAVING -- TO I DO DIRECTLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS FEARFUL ARE AWAKE BECAUSE DIFFERENT ISSUES FOR THE FOLKS THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT SO. THAT IS THE MACRO BOOKING AT THE THE MAD SO I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WE HAVE A BECAUSE STATE THAT IS EXTREMELY HIGH -- PRICEY TO LIVE IN. AND WE HAVE TONS OF POVERTY OF THE HAVE TITANS OF HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE UNDEREMPLOYED AND WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT ARE IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME ARE LESS LIKELY TO LEAVE AND LESLIE AND MORE LIKELY TO COME BACK TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSE THERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WAY. IF YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE BE OUT IN THE COLD ARE IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE OUT IN THE COLD ARE YOU KNOW STAYED IN THIS PLACE AND SO WILL YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE STRUCTURE ISSUES THAT THE MONTH SO WE WANNA ALSO TEACHES THAT. KEEP IN MIND OF THE ISSUES AROUND. YOU KNOW HOUSING AND IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE AN AREA THE NIGHT NOT ONLY A PHOTO -- CAUSES ISSUES IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS BUT THAT ALSO EXACERBATES PROBLEMS AROUND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND LASTLY I WANT TO FOCUS ON KIND OF THE MESO ISSUES ARMS YOU NEED THE MACRO ISSUES. AND THINKING ABOUT CULTURE WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT OR DON'T ACTUALLY PUT A LOT OF TIME AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY. IMPORTANT THAT WE HAD SPENT SOME TIME -- WELL I WOULD SAY SINCE THE ME TO MOVE MAY HAVE STARTED THAT WE'VE SEEN MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PATRIARCHY ASIDE GINNY AND OUR SPACE SAYS. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW PATRIARCHY AND MISOGYNY INTERSECTS WITH RACISM AND CLASS OF THOUGH PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO INTIMATE PRTNER VIOLENCE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. RAY WHAT IS IN ME WILL BE LOOK AT FOLKS AND WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME VALUE FOR THAT. FREIGHT WHAT IS IT MEAN WHEN SOMEBODY REPORTS -- SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPY AND WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT SEEN THEM AS A FULL HUMAN BE. AND SO WHEN WE HAVE CONVERSATION RACISM THE CLASS OF THOUGH THEY ARE TONS OF REPORTS AND I JUST EXPERIENCED THIS IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO REPORT IT. HER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. AND IF SHE WASN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY ISSUE WAS LEAKING -- LINKED LOOKED AT AS DIET YOU SOMEONE WHO IS NOT VALUED -- SOMEONE WHO IS THIS LAKE THOUGH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THOSE FOLKS STILL WITH. AND WHAT HAPPENS WAS HER PLACE GOT TRASHED YET THE SEND HER DAUGHTER OFF AND SHE HAS TO MOVE. RATE IN THIS OF THE THINGS THAT IS NOT TALKED ABOUT A LOT WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT HOW DO WE ADDRESS RACISM AND CLASSISM AND PATRIARCHY AND OUR SPACE SAYS WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW IN WHICH WE ARE REINFORCING THE CONVERSATIONS -- WITH OUR YOUTH IN PARTICULAR WE HAD -- THERE IS A STUDY THAT CAME OUT. I'M NOT TOO LONG AGO THAT WAS LOOKING AT WOMEN -- IS MEET YOUNG FOLKS. AND ACCESS. TO PARTICULARLY BLACK GIRLS WHAT DO YOU THINK SOCIETY THINKS ABOUT CHAU. AND THEY SAID THAT THEY THOUGHT THE SOCIETIES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT APPEAL WITH THEIR SEX APPEAL. RIGHT AND THESE ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND SO WE ARE TALLIED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE ARE SHOWING IN OUR CULTURE AT THAT THEIR MOST IMPORTANT. THING IS THEIR SEX APPEAL OF WHETHER THEY'RE INTO THEIR AND THE RELATIONSHIP. RATE THAN THEIR VALUES OF WAY OF THEIR RELIEF THAT THEY VALUE THE RELATIONSHIP SOMETIMES MORE THAN THEY VALUE THEMSELVES AND THAT ACTUALLY ALSO REINFORCES THE CARGO -- REINFORCE THE SPACE AND REINFORCES THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE WE ARE. ESSENTIALLY SOCIETY SAID YOU'RE NOT WORTHY OF BEING [inaudible] SAFE AND SO I AM NOT SURE WINNER CLOSE AS TO THE MEASURE FAIRLY SEPARATES BUT TALKED ABOUT -- JUST A COUPLE OF SPOTS. A LIST THAT HE LOOKING AT DV CALLED THREE OF BECAUSE INCREASED 11% BETWEEN TWENTY ELEVEN CITY TWENTY ELEVEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN IN CALIFORNIA. OVER ONE OUT OF THREE WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA HAVE REPORTED HAVING BEEN SUBJECT TO RAPE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ARE STOCKING. AND WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE MURDERED BY A SPOUSE THEN MAN. WOMEN OF COLOR OFTEN IMPACTED BY HIGHER RATES THAN WHITE WOMEN LOW INCOME WOMEN OFTEN HAVE LEFT THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH DVD IPV AND I'M MORE OF THAT I'M MORE AFFLUENT COUNTERPARTS. BOTH BLACK WOMEN AND INDIGENOUS WOMEN HAVE RATES FOR HOSPITAL COUNTERS COSTS BY ASSAULT HIGHER THAN THE CALIFORNIA AVERAGE WITH BOTH BLACK WOMEN IN THE DEPLOYMENT SKEWING THE DATA BLACK WOMEN ARE ONE THOUSAND POINT SIX PER. ONE HUNDRED OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. NEED OF ONE MAN ARTERIES. AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE POINT NINE PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN. AND ALL POLL BE W. W. CONDUCTED WITH OUR PARTNERS IN OUR OLD WAYS NATIONAL BLACK WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AGENDA. OVER THE ONE IN THREE BLACK MOTHERS THAT WE REPORT IT HAVE APART IT BE IN RATES. AND SO WE THINK ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I USED UP MY CONVERSATION AND A WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT OF THE COMMITTEE WITH THINK ABOUT TODAY IS HOW WE ADDRESS THESE ARE THE THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS. OF BOTH ADDRESS THE THE INDIVIDUAL CHAMA NEEDS THAT WE HAVE FOR FOLKS. THINKING ABOUT THE POLICY AND THE INTERSECTIONAL ISSUES WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR FOLKS IN TERMS OF LOW INCOME. AND ALSO WOMEN OF COLOR AND ALSO THE SOCIETAL WINDS THAT HOW DO WE ALSO CREATE SOCIETIES AND CULTURES AND CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE INCLUSIVE AND MATTER OF VALUE IT AND GIVE DIGNITY. TO WOMEN IN LOW INCOME WOMEN BEGAN. THANK YOU I'M I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD -- pLISTENING TO TO THE DISCUSSION WHAT BAFFLED ME I WAS PART OF -- TESTIFYING AGAINST MY SISTER'S ABUSER AND THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE AND HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT WE CAN GET AN ANSWER TO THAT IS SHE WENT TO COURT FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER. AND WHICH IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ACTUALLY CHARGING HIM WITH ANY CRIME. AND SO. WHEN SHE WENT TO WE HAVE TO SPEND A HEFTY AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH ATTORNEYS WHICH? BY ALL ACCOUNTS THAT SHE HAD TO BORROW MONEY FROM MY PARENTS EXOTIC FEDERAL. AND I WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT RESTRAINING ORDER WE WERE NOT ABLE TO AFFORD ANOTHER ATTORNEY TO TRY AND CHARGE HIM. WITH THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE AND THAT'S WHERE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM. AND I NEED YOUR HELP IF THERE IS ANYTHING LEGISLATIVELY THAT WE CAN DO TO CORRECT THAT BECAUSE AWAIT HER ATTORNEY SAID. WAS. HERE'S THE THE RESTRAINING ORDER. HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO PRESS CHARGES YOU HAVE TO GO TO COURT AGAIN IMPROVE IT NOT ONLY PROVE IT BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY ON AN ATTORNEY. TO DO THIS AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IS. HE'S STILL TRYING TO ABUSE HER. AND THE WAY HE IS DOING IT IS BECAUSE MY SISTER IS RUNNING FOR US SENATE AND SO WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO HE PUT SOMEBODY TO RUN AGAINST HER. AND NOW HE HAS REQUESTED PUBLIC RECORDS ON OUR THERE'S THREE SISTERS HE'S REQUESTED PUBLIC RECORDS ON MY SISTER SHE WORKS FOR CITY. AND SO IT'S HIS WAY OF STILL POKING -- AT NOT JUST HURT BY ACT OUR FAMILY IS IN GENERAL AND SO I AM. CONFUSED I GUESS AS TO WHAT. WE CAN DO TO STOP HIM. AND HE'S NOT STOPPING AND BUT HE'S PUSHING THAT ENVELOPE HE'S DOING YOU KNOW THE POKING A LITTLE BIT SEE IF HE GETS YOU NOT LIKE A KID YOU POKE. TO SEE IF YOU GET BURNED IF YOU YOU KNOW YOU TOUCHING THE HOT FLAME AND THEN YOU POKE AGAIN AND IF YOU CAN GET BURNED AGAIN THEN YOU KEEP. PUSHING AND AND SO WE HAVE A CONFERENCE THIS WEEKEND. AND SINCE WERE ELECTED OFFICIALS MY SISTER IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WE HEAR THAT HE'S ATTENDING AND SO. I AM NOT PART OF THE THE RESTRAINING ORDER -- ONLY SHE AS AND SO. YOU KNOW THAT WHOLE DYNAMIC AND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE HAVE RESOURCES I HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES INTO INFORMATION AND SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS. NOT A FOR ITS DIFFICULT ENOUGH FOR IT FOR ACTS BUT FOR SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT WE DO THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE ACCESS TO OUR PARENTS THAT CAN PROVERBIAL HELP WITH A LITTLE BIT -- I WANT US TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO LEGISLATIVELY AND IN ON THROWING IT OUT THERE. TO CLOSE ITS WHICH SEEMS TO ME LIKE A LOOPHOLE. OF DOT NOW AFTER SHE READ OBTAINED A RESTRAINING ORDER NOW SHE HAS TO GO BACK. AND TRY TO CHARGE HIM AND SO HIS NARRATIVE NOW AS WELL. IF I WAS THAT GUILTY WHY HAVEN'T I BEEN CHARGED. AND SO HE'S CONVINCING OTHER FOLKS GULLIBLE FOLKS THAT -- HE DIDN'T DO IT THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE THAT THE JUDGE GAVE THE RESTRAINING ORDER AND YOU'D BE SURPRISED. IN OUR POLITICAL WORLD. THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF NOT JUST MALES A WHOLE BUNCH OF FEMALES INCLUDING SOME MEMBERS OF MY OWN -- CAUCUS THAT ACTUALLY BELIEVE HIM THEY BELIEVE THAT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND SO. HELP ME AGAIN WE CANNOT DO THIS TODAY OBVIOUSLY BUT I EXPECTS AND I WILL. MAKE SURE THAT I'M HERE FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS AND SOUL IF YOU ALL CAN HELP ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. BECAUSE IT'S UNFAIR IT'S UNJUST AND LIKE I SAID NOT JUST TO TALK TO OZ BY TWO WOMEN. LOW INCOME WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE ACCESS TO RESOURCES IT'S HAPPENING. AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESSES. SO WE WENT ACCORDING UP THE RESTRAINING ORDER AND THEN WENT. AND THEN WHAT BECAUSE WE THINK ALL THE SHE GOT THE RESTRAINING ORDER TALL GOOD KNOWN. SHE'S IT'S A THREE YEAR RESTRAINING ORDER AND WE'RE IN THE SECOND YEAR SO WHAT HAPPENS ON THAT THIRD YEAR. AND IF HE'S. FIGURING OUT WAYS TO STILL ABUSER BECAUSE IT'S STILL ABUSE MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT HE THINKS IT'S JUST OPOKU ITS POLITICAL NO IT'S ABUSE DEL HOW. THEN WHAT HAPPENS AND I THINK WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT. I AND I AM SURE THIS WILL BE A TOPIC OF LONG CONVERSATION BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER. SO A FEMALE -- GET OUT OF THAT SITUATION. AND THEN WHAT IT THEN THEY'RE STRUGGLING FOR A VERY LONG TIME I RECENTLY HEARD -- TERRY CREWS AYE THE ACTOR AND HE PUT OUT A VIDEO AND IF HE'S LISTENING HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA IT HAS TAG HIM. ON THIS BECAUSE I DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT HIS MOTHER. WAS ALWAYS READY TO LEAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP AND SHE WAS LIKE PACKING THEIR BAGS AND IT'S LIKE OKAY KIDS LET'S GO AND THEN SHE WOULD SAY. BUT WE'VE GOT NOWHERE TO GO. WE'VE GOT NO MONEY TO GO FIND A PLACE AND THEN THEY WOULD STAY IN THAT RELATIONSHIP AND SO IT'S SOMETIMES IT IS THE PERCEPTION THAT THESE WOMEN STAY. WHY ARE YOU STAYING I EVEN GOT I A I A FACEBOOK. POSTED LIKE OH YEAH I FIVE HOURS SO ANGRY AT MY SISTERS ABUSER WHY DID YOU ALLOW HIM TO HELP ME NOT KNOWING ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN BETWEEN AND SO. SO AGAIN LOOKING AT THE VICTIM AS SHAMING THEM. FOR STAYING FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IN TERRY CRUISES CASE HE SAID THAT. THE MOM WOULD SAY HEY LET'S GO BUT THEN WE GOT NOWHERE TO GO NO INCOME. SO WHAT HAPPENS THEN SO IN OUR LATER CONVERSATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. SO WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE RETRAIN RESTRAINING ORDER EXPIRES WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT THAT WOMAN DOES ACTUALLY LEAVE. YOU KNOW WOULD DO WE HAVE ANY DATA AS TO HOW WELL THEY ARE DOING OR HOW WELL THEIR KIDS ARE DOING AND HAVE THEY BEEN BE ABUSED. NOT BY THE SAME PERSON BUT BY THE NEXT. ONE BECAUSE NOW I'M SURE THEY'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP WHERE THEY YOU KNOW FALL INTO. TWO THE SAME SITUATION BUT I WILL STOP RIGHT THERE AND THAT'S FOOD FOR THOUGHT I GUESS BECAUSE WE TO HAVE MANY MANY ISSUES TO DISCUSS BUT IN ARE IN FEW FUTURE CONVERSATIONS. I WOULD LIKE. TO ASK IT IF ANY OF YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH OR HAVE SEEN ANY STATISTICS AFTER. WE PROVIDE ALL OF THE SUPPORT THAN WHAT HAPPENED SO THANK YOU AND FOR INDULGING ME IN THE CONVERSATION BUT NEXT WE HAVE -- ME'S FROM -- STAND. I THINK YOU HELLO HOW'S EVERYBODY GOING [inaudible] LET. OKAY CAN BE ABLE TO HEAR ME. MONDAY WAS SEVENTH MAYES AND I'M A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND I ALSO WORK AT STAND UP PLASTER AS THE HOUSING MANAGER I'VE BEEN OUT OF MY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION FOR A WHILE NOW AND THERE WAS A LOT OF BARRIERS THAT I WAS FACED WITH WITH BEYOND A SINGLE MOTHER OF THREE HAVE NO TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALL THE WAY FROM INDIANA WITH NO FAMILY. SO I DID END UP IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT -- WAS VERY HARD -- AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I FACED WAS TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. IT WAS EXTREMELY HARD THAT WAS HARD FOR ME TO GET HOUSING --% THE HOUSING THAT I HAD IT WASN'T SAFE -- AND NOT ONLY THAT IT DIDN'T PROTECT ME FROM THE ABUSER BECAUSE LET'S. TALK ABOUT A RESTRAINING ORDER YOU KNOW THEY GAVE ME A FIVE YEAR RESTRAINING ORDER AND IT DIDN'T STOP HIM. HE STILL CAME AND HARASSED ME BY IN ORDER FOR HIM TO BE RE ARRESTED. HE WOULD HAVE TO BE CAUGHT OWN THING BASICALLY SO -- THAT WITH THE CAT AND MOUSE GAME ME OR MY CHILDREN -- AND SO BEGAN THAT I'D NOW WORK WITH VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SEXUAL THOUGHT AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING [inaudible] THERE'S SO. SO MANY LAYERS AND BARRIERS THAT I SEE THAT JUST REALLY CONFIRMS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A REAL PROBLEM. AND THAT THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR SAFETY. OUR SAFE HOUSES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. THIS PROBLEM IS INCREASING AND CLIENTS ARE HAPPEN TO BE TURNED AWAY BECAUSE THIS SHELTERS FULL OR THAT SHELTERS FOOL AND THEN THE MONEY THAT WE DO GET. IT'S RESTRICTED. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED IS WE NEED UNRESTRICTED FUNDS EVER WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAVE LIVES NOT ONLY DO WE NEED AND RESTRICT THE FANS BUT WE NEED SERVICES. THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO TAP INTO [inaudible] MENTAL HEALTH. A LOT OF ARE SURVIVORS END UP HOMELESS. AND IN THAT MENTAL MENTALLY UNSTABLE BECAUSE OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO YOU HAVE YOU KNOW. MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA THEN YOU HAVE HOUSING IS WAY TOO HIGH AND THEN YOU KNOW THAT THAT HUMAN RESOURCE OR HUMAN SERVICES. THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE. SURVIVORS ENOUGH TIME TO GET ON THEIR FEET BEFORE THE ALREADY PULLED THE RUG FROM UP UNDER OWN NOT PROVIDING CHILDCARE. NOT PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION -- AND HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE THAT ONLY MAKING FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS A MONTH WITH THREE KIDS THAT HAVE TO PAY TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN RENT THAT THEY HAVE TO SURVIVE THEY NEED TO SURVIVE ON THAT [inaudible] IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. SO WE NEED MORE FUNDING IN THAT AREA WE NEED MORE FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH WE NEED -- ABUSERS WE NEED FUNDING FOR THEM SO THAT THEY CAN. GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. YOU KNOW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR. SO WHAT OF WHAT AT WHAT IS THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE WHAT IS THE ROOT OF THEIR ABUSE THAT CAUSES THEM TO IT TO HARM PEOPLE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF I THINK THAT THAT WE JUST. YOU NO WE WE EVEN DONE AWAY WITH LANDLORD DISCRIMINATION. AND HOUSING PROGRAM THAT I RENT. I HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME GETTING CLIENTS HAL'S BECAUSE LANDLORDS WANT TO DISCRIMINATE WHAT WE DON'T YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT THAT PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY OR THEY REYES THAT -- DEPOSITS TWO ONE THREE TIMES TO READ BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THERE IS A PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT. BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN THE PROGRAM ENDS OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL STRUGGLING AND THEN. THEY END UP BACK IN THE SAME CYCLE THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED. ANOTHER ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP ALL BECAUSE WE JUST WANT TO SURVIVE. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TO GET AHEAD WE WANT TO BE ABLE. TO TO BREAK THAT TO BREAK THE SILENCE FOR OUR FAMILIES BECAUSE IF WE DON'T BREAK IT F. SURVIVORS. THIS JUST GOING TO GOING TO THE NEXT GENERATION OUR OWN KIDS. AND SO -- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOU KNOW THE STORY WITH YOUR SISTER AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T A RATHER CAKE THIS ISSUE. IF IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST PROBLEM IS IT'S A SOCIETY PROBLEM IS NOT YOU KNOW HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT. FOR ITS SOCIETY AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND NEXT WE HAVE RACHEL SMITH. PATTY HI RACHEL OTHER THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME. OR DO I NEED TO TALK INTO THIS ATTACK. SOME MY NAME IS RACHEL SMITH I AM OF JERICHO APACHE THE ON OFF THEM AND I'M MEXICAN -- NOT HISPANIC AND I AM HERE TODAY ON THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME AND I'VE HEARD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND I'M HOPEFUL BUT YOU KNOW FOR CHANGE -- I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE NATIVE COMMUNITY THAT I SUPPORT PARENTS SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- AND YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR SHARING THE STORY ABOUT YOUR FAMILY -- IN TWO THOUSAND WHEN THE SAFE FOR SIX IN SUMMER DINO COUNTY MY COUSIN WAS -- A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHE ALSO FILED A RESTRAINING ORDER AND IT WAS A REALLY LONG PROCESS FOR THAT RESTRAINING ORDER. AND ULTIMATELY SHE WAS KILLED BY HER EX HUSBAND AND SO -- THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WHY IT IS THAT I DO THE WORK THAT I DO. IN ADDITION TO MY OWN HISTORY -- OUR PEOPLE ARE -- SURVIVORS OF INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE IT ALL BEGINS FOR US -- FOR A LOT OF US WE ARE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS VERY NORMALIZED. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN OUR HOMES AND WERE RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S JUST FIGHTING YOU KNOW AND THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW SOMEBODY GETS KILLED AND IT'S REALLY NOT THAT SIMPLE. AND SO -- FOR ME I DON'T BELIEVE NECESSARILY THAT IT'S COMPLETELY A POVERTY ISSUE I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A A FACTOR OF OPPRESSION. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SUPPORT THAT ARE OPPRESSED IN THIS IS A COMMON DENOMINATOR IN ALL OF THEM. THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT ARE AT THE POVERTY LEVEL THAT ARE VERY HEALTHY YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST ARE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY -- FOR A GOOD NATIVE COMMUNITY AS FAR AS THE WOMEN AND THE CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED A HUGE BARRIER FOR US IS THAT WE DON'T REPORT PORTS UNDER REPORTED DUE TO AGAIN HISTORICAL TRAUMA -- FROM THE BOARDING SCHOOL ERAS THE CHILDREN WERE REMOVED FROM FAMILIES AND IN THAT PROCESS A LOT OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE SEXUALLY MOLESTED -- CAME OUT BEING YOU KNOW ABUSERS THEMSELVES. AND A LOT OF THE DRUG. PROBLEMS AND ALCOHOLISM BEGAN TO LIKE INVEST OUR OUR PEOPLE AND SO OF THE DOTS A HUGE PART OF THE BARRIER AS TO WHY IT'S ALSO UNDER REPORTED I BELIEVE -- CASE IN POINT RIGHT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE BORDER THE CHILDREN ARE BEING REMOVED AND THOSE CHILDREN ARE BASICALLY AT SOME POINT PROBABLY GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT WE SUPPORT YOU KNOW AND IT ALL IT'S DOING IS CAUSING INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA AND MORE TRAUMA -- WE SEE I SUPPORT WOMEN AND YOUNG GIRLS THAT SCORE A TEN ON THE A SCREENING. AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT THAT IS BASICALLY A FACTOR THAT'S PROVING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE MAJOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND PROBLEMS AT WHEN THEY GROW UP. IN ADDITION TO THEIR CHILDREN AND SO -- AS% FAR AS HOUSING IS CONCERNED -- WE WORK WITH THE POPULATION THAT THEIR ABUSERS WILL LITERALLY BURN THEIR IDENTITY AND THEY TAKE FROM THEM AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ACTIONS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IS A VERY VERY IT'S LIKE HARD TO GET IT BACK. WHEN YOU'RE CRISIS YOU'RE NOT THINKING? I NEED MY ID SO I CAN GO GET A HOTEL YOU'RE JUST THINKING HOW MY GOING TO BE SAFE COMING IN TO GET TO THIS NEXT UP -- THERE ARE A LOT OF BARRIERS AS FAR AS THE LANDLORDS ARE CONCERNED. THEY THEY DO DISCRIMINATE BASED ON THEM TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR OWN PROPERTIES IN THEIR OWN YOU KNOW -- I GUESS RESOURCES AND THEY DON'T WANT THE SAME CYCLE TO BE REPEATED AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CALM. AND YOU KNOW CAUSE A RUCKUS BECAUSE IN SOME OF THE CASES THAT'S AND THAT ENDS UP WHAT'S HAPPENING -- WE'RE SAYING THAT DB IS ONE OF THE MAIN CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS. A IN URBAN AREAS STEEPLY CPS IS OFTEN CALLED AND THAT THE AGAIN THE FEAR OF REMOVING OUR CHILDREN IS A BIG IT'S A BIG BARRIER IF NOT THE NUMBER ONE THE LACK OF CULTURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE HERE IN SACRAMENTO FOR THE NATIVE POPULATION -- SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A TRUST ISSUE AND AGAIN THAT GOES BACK TO HISTORICAL TRAUMA. WE LOSE JOBS. DUE TO LACK OF SICK TIME A LOT OF OUR PEOPLE DON'T HAVE. I THOUGHT IT OF FORMAL EDUCATION. AND SO. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RESTRAINING ORDER PROCESS IT'S AN ENTIRE DAY IF IT GETS APPROVED IF YOU DO IT RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE TO COME BACK AND CONTINUALLY PRESSED CHARGES IN ADDITION TO FIGURING OUT WHERE YOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO GO. GOING BACK AND PICKING THEM UP THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE REGULAR OPERATIONAL THINGS FOR PEOPLE LIKE US BUT SOMEBODY IN CRISIS HAS A REALLY REALLY HARD TIME PUTTING ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER -- A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES ARE OSTRACIZED FROM THE COMMUNITIES AND THEIR OWN FAMILIES FOR SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE FAMILY. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE NECESSARILY DO IT THERE'S AN OLD SAYING THAT HAPPENS ON THE RED STATES ON THE ROADS. AND UNFORTUNATELY -- DOT IS PART OF OF HOW WE'RE RAISED. AND AGAIN IT'S DUE TO TRUST ISSUE I THINK IT'S A CULTURAL THING -- ARE THE INCREASE IN THE MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN THE COUNTY IN THE NATION AND EVEN IN OUR STATE. IS THROUGH THE ROOF OUR NUMBERS ARE UNDER REPORTED AND THAT IS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CODED CORRECTLY AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. OF WE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HISPANIC NOT AMERICAN INDIAN OR OTHER OR MULTIRACIAL -- AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO'S ONE RACE AND SO IT JUST SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE BOP MULTIRACIAL BUT APPARENTLY NOT MARKES -- I WILL CLOSE WITH THIS AS FAR AS YOU SPEAKING ABOUT THE LAWS AND HOW. THINGS NEED TO BE CHANGED -- IN FEBRUARY SEVENTH KADISHA BRITAIN OF COAL BELOW. I BELIEVE SHE'S Y. LACKEY TRIBE SHE ONE FEBRUARY [inaudible] SEVEN TEN POINT. THE WEEK BEFORE HER ATTACKER -- HER ABUSER ATTACKED HER WITH A HAMMER. SHE REPORTED THIS TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- SERVICES UP IN KABUL WHERE SHE LIVES BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT FOUND. AND BECAUSE SHE STILL MISSING THE CHARGES AGAINST HIS KIDNAPPING HIS KIDNAPPING CHARGES HAVE BEEN DROPPED. THEIR STATEMENT WAS NOBODY NO VICTIM. AND SO THAT FAMILIES THERE ARE SUFFERING THE RESOURCES ARE VERY VERY LIMITED AND LAW ENFORCEMENT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SEEM. TO HAVE ALL OF THOSE YOU KNOW THEY STILL HAVE LOOPHOLES AS WELL I UNDERSTAND NOT BUT AT THE SAME TIME. SHE'S MISSING BECAUSE BECAUSE SHE IS AND SO OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE BUT AT THE SAME TIME. YOU NOW SEIZE HOLD THE GUN POINT AND SO THOSE FAMILIES ALL WE CAN DO IS PRAY FOR THEM AND ALL WE CAN DO IS SPEAK OUT. FOR THEM MOTHERS WHO BRIAN HERE ON THAT IS DEFINITELY STILL AN INVISIBLE POPULATION. OUR DEPENDENCE THAT ARE -- YOUNGER AND IN THE SYSTEM WHO ARE IN BOLD TRIBAL MEMBERS ARE COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THERE TYPES ARE NOT NOTIFIED. SO -- I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT -- NEXT WE HAVE A BETH HASSETT CEO AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WE'VE. THANK YOU HELLO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- IT'S AN INTERESTING PANEL TO BE ON SINCE -- I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THIS FIELD SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ASSURING PEOPLE THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY NO MATTER WHAT THEIR SOCIO ECONOMIC SITUATION IS. YET WE KNOW THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING SOCIAL SERVICES. OUR LOW INCOME AT WE'VE -- THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO COMES IN OUR SAFE HOUSE HAS AN INCOME OF SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. HIGHLY RESOURCE TO PEOPLE -- WE'VE IS CELEBRATING FORTY YEARS OF SERVICE THIS YEAR AS ARE MANY OF THE AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGENCIES IN OUR STATE SO EVERY COUNTY THEORETICALLY. HAS A WIDE ARRAY OF SERVICES HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- IT LOOKS DIFFERENT IN LA THAN IT DOES IN SOME OF OUR NORTHERN NORTHERN COUNTIES WHERE ON THEIR VERY REMOTE AND PEOPLE REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH ACCESS TO SERVICES. SPECIALLY IF THEY'RE LOW INCOME HAVE NO TRANSPORTATION CAN'T GET TO IT TO THOSE AGENCIES AND THE AGENCIES ARE OFTEN COMPROMISE THERE AREN'T AS MANY COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO PARTNER WITH THEY'RE JUST NOT GETTING TO SOME OF THOSE. CLIENTS WHO ARE GOING TO BE WALKING THROUGH THE DOORS AND SEEK SERVICES. I'M OVER THE YEARS WE'VE HAS REALLY PRIORITIZE THAT MOST -- THE CLIENTS AT THE MOST BARRIERS. AND THAT OFTEN HAS TO DO WITH THEM EITHER LIVING IN AN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY OR SIMPLY NOT HAVING THE RESOURCES TO EVEN GET TO OUR OFFICES. AND IT'S INTERESTING YOU TALK ABOUT LEGAL SERVICES I MEAN ON THE ONE SIDE THERE'S THE CRIMINAL SIDE OF THINGS WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT OUGHT TO BE ARRESTING PEOPLE. AND OUGHT TO BE THE DA'S OFFICE OUGHT TO BE CHARGING THEM AND THEY OUGHT TO BE HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE. BUT THEN WE'VE GOT. VICTIMS WHO ARE UNWILLING. TO TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS THEY DON'T TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY'RE NOT GONNA CALL LOCK LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THAT THEY'D THEY'D. THEY DO THEY MAKE IT SO THE SOME OF THOSE CASES DON'T MOVE FORWARD. UP WE HAVE A PRETTY ROBUST LEGAL DEPARTMENT AND WE PRIORITIZE VICTIMS WHOSE PERPETRATOR. IS ALL LAWYER UP AND HAS RESOURCES AND SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A VERY POOR OUTCOME. IN HER CIVIL SIDE OF THINGS GETTING THAT RESTRAINING ORDER IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE REPRESENTATION FROM WE'VE. AND EVEN THEN AS YOU SAID IT'S THAT COULD BE THREE YEARS IT IT COULD NEVER BECOME A PERMANENT. PERMANENT STAY AWAY ORDER AND SHE SCRAMBLING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO ONCE THAT RESTRAINING ORDERS -- GONE. I THINK ONE OF THE GREAT STRIDES WE'VE MADE IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS IS THAT PEOPLE PEOPLE ALL PRETTY MUCH SAY OKAY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A BAD THING IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT KEEP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. BUT EVERYBODY STILL PICTURES THAT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AND IF SOMEBODY EVEN THOUGH THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. IF THEY WERE NEVER HIT OR IF THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING PHYSICAL IT WAS -- EMOTIONAL ABUSE FINANCIAL ABUSE. SPIRITUAL OF YOU ABUSE THEY ALMOST FEEL LIKE IT DOESN'T COUNT. AND I THINK WHERE WHERE PEOPLE FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IS YOU GET A CRAFTY ABUSER WHO'S DOING ALL KINDS OF AGGRESSIVE IN POWER WIELDING THINGS LIKE SHOWING UP AT AT SOMEBODY'S. SOMEBODY'S COMMITTEE MEETINGS OR I KINGS SOMEBODY BUT DOING IT IN A PRETTY CRAFTY WAY IT'S HARD FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO REST THAT PERSON IT'S HARD TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. AND AND VICTIMS ARE LEFT FEELING LIKE WELL NOBODY'S GONNA BELIEVE ME AND I HAVE NO RESOURCES. THERE ARE A LOT OF STATISTICS OUT THERE BUT THERE AREN'T VERY GOOD STATISTICS I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS. WHAT WE KNOW HOW MANY -- CALLS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- RELATED CRIMES ARE WHERE IT IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND THAT'S WHAT IT'S BEEN FOR THE LAST. TEN YEARS IT SH. AND WE KNOW THAT -- IN THOSE CASES ABOUT 40% OF THE TIME THERE WAS A WEAPON USED USUALLY THE PERPETRATOR'S BODY IT'S OF PFISTER OF FOOT OR SOMETHING NOT SO MUCH -- WEAPONS WE THINK OF AS WEAPONS BUT THAT'S ALL WE KNOW AND WE ALSO KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CALLING ON FOR SMITH THEY'RE THEY'RE LIVING IN A COMMUNITY WHERE YOU DON'T DO THAT. YOU -- YOU EITHER DON'T TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT OR YOU'RE JUST NOT GOING TO DO THAT. SO THOSE STATISTICS AREN'T PARTICULARLY HELPFUL WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INCIDENTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN OUR STATE I WILL TELL YOU THAT. THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE MOSTLY SERVING NEED HOUSING THEY NEED TRANSPORTATION THEY NEED CHILD CARE. AND THAT THEY NEED A JOB AND RESOURCES AND THEIR PAST ALREADY COMPROMISED THROUGH DECO WEARS AN IDENTITY THEFT FRAUD. EVICTIONS WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BEEN THE ONE TO BE A BIT EVICTED BUT LANDLORDS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT ONE BIG HOLE RIGHT NOW IS PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN MOBILE HOME PARKS THE THE LAWS ABOUT. EVICTION DON'T APPLY BECAUSE YOU'RE RENTING THE LAND BUT YOU OWN THE HOUSE AND THAT'S A THAT'S A HUGE HOLE IN OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTION LAWS BECAUSE TOO OFTEN VICTIMS ARE BEING. EVICTED WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T BE AFFECTED BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAW TO PROTECT THEM [inaudible] COME. I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT FINANCIAL ABUSE 99% OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE HAVE SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL ABUSE AND THAT IS WHAT HOLDS PEOPLE DOWN I MEAN IT IF YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. YOU STAY AND YOU END UP HOMELESS AND THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS ARE THE REALLY THE HIDDEN HOMELESS IN OUR COMMUNITY. ON THEIR ON THE VERGE OF BEING HOMELESS OF PEOPLE DON'T THINK OF THEM AS BEING HOMELESS. AND THEY ARE OUT THERE PITCHING TENTS IN THE STREETS OF PEOPLE REALLY JUST AREN'T EVEN ARE EVEN THINKING ABOUT THEM. AND THEIR NOT HAVING ACCESS TO A LOT OF THE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT CONTINUUM OF CARE HAVE -- SOME COUNTIES REALLY HAVE IT DIALED IN BUT FOR INSTANCE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND MANY OTHERS -- YOU HAVE TO BE PART OF THE H. M. HMIS SYSTEM TO EVEN BE ELIGIBLE TO HAVE OF THE ICE BUT THAT DONE AND TO GET ABOUT ON THE VOUCHER LIST AND ALL OF THAT. WELL UNLESS THE COUNTY HAS GATTACA -- A CONCERTED EFFORT AND A COORDINATED EFFORT TO KEEP VICTIMS NAMES AND IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OUT OF THE H. AMAYA BE IN THERE SO IN SACRAMENTO FOR INSTANCE WE'RE STILL WORKING ON WITH THAT PROTOCOL LOOKS LIKE. BUT WE CAN'T PUT VICTIMS WHO ARE STAYING IN OUR EMERGENCY SHELTER INTO A SYSTEM THAT ANYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY COULD LOOK AT SO IT'S SOME OF IT'S JUST THE SYSTEMS CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. BUT ALSO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES THAT. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE AND THAT WE DON'T SO. I WOULD SAY -- THE BIG CHANGES WE NEED TO SEE OF SERVICE PROVISION A LOT OF WHAT WE DO IS AND STATE STATUTE WE HAVE DUBBED SHELTER WE HAVE TO HAVE A HOTLINE ALL OF THOSE THINGS. BUT WE NEED TO BE SERVING PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY LIVE WHERE THEY HAVE TRUST IN THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ARE PROVIDING IT TO THEM. WE NEED TO BE IN FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS HAVE MOBILE ADVOCACY WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE SAFELY IN A HOSPITAL OR OTHER DOCTORS OFFICES ARE FINALLY SAYING I NEED HELP. AND WE NEED WE NEED BE PUTTING RESOURCES INTO GETTING TO PEOPLE RATHER THAN ASKING THEM TO COME TO US AND CHOOSE FROM OUR MENU OF SERVICES THAT IS VARIAS. SHOVE A SAID VERY DICTATED BY STATUTE AND OUR FUNDERS AND WE NEED TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO SERVE PEOPLE WHERE THEY WANT TO BE SERVED AND IN A WAY THAT. IS SURVIVOR CENTER AND HOW THEY NEED TO HOW THEY'VE HOW THEY WANT TO BE SERVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO WELCOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY SOME VERY ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- GIPSON AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANDY BUT I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE IT AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER -- GIPSON WAS WITH ME THE LAST TIME I REALLY APPRECIATED IS HIS AYE INPUT AND SO WAS ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA IS -- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES US BUDGET COMMITTEE AND HE'S ALSO A MEMBER OF HUMAN SERVICES BUT I WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO THANK HIM PUBLICLY -- WELL THERE WAS A LOT OF ASKS IN IN THE STATE BUDGET AND I KNOW WE ALL WANTED SOMETHING AND I JUST REALLY HAVE TO SAY THAT WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA WAS. WAS WAS VERY OF REWARDING FOR ME I LEARNED A LOT FROM HIM BUT HE HE WAS ABLE TO HELP BUT AS IN TERMS OF OF RESOURCES FOR HUMAN SERVICES THAT ARE DIRECTLY. AFFECTING -- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS ARE A HE WAS ABLE TO HELP US GET A BUDGET ASK LEADING GET EVERYTHING THAT WE WANTED BUT HE WAS HE WAS ABLE TO GET US TEN MILLION DOLLARS. ACTUALLY TWENTY IF THEY DID SOME CREATIVE ACCOUNTING AND IT ENDED UP BEING TWENTY MILLION HE ONLY GETS CREDIT FOR TEN BUT I THINK IN MY BOOK IS ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR SERVICES. BUT WE WILL WERE ABLE TO INCREASE THE THE THE ARM. AWARDS -- FOR CAL WORKS AND CAL FRESH DIED IT WAS AN OVERALL INCREASE BUT IT FOR THE SAKE. OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY IT DIRECTLY AFFECTED A LOT OF THE BUS VIOLENCE VICTIMS. AND SURVIVORS AND IN TERMS OF HOUSING HE WAS GET SOME MONEY THERE AND AGAIN IT'S NOT DIRECTLY ALLOCATED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES BUT I KNOW THAT OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL BENEFIT FROM. THE WORK THAT HE DID AND YOU KNOW I'M PUTTING THEM ON THE SPOT BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS BUDGET. IT'S AN AMAZING PLACE UP HERE I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'S AN AMAZING PLACE BUT THE THE THE INTRICACIES OF TRYING TO PASS A BUDGET. GO THROUGH SO MANY LAYERS THAT IT WAS JUST. I WAS BANGING MY HEAD THE WHOLE TIME AND I HAD TO DEPEND ON ON STAFF TO TO GO THROUGH IT AND I KNOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME SO HE KIND OF ALREADY KNEW. BUT THE THE ARM. WORK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE ARAMBULA DID FOR US AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT WAS HUGE SO THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR WORK. AND WELCOME. RIGHT OUT ANYTHING ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. APOLOGIES FOR BEING TARDY I HAVEN'T QUITE FIGURED OUT HOW TO CLONE MYSELF YET AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE COMMITTEES AT THE SAME TIME -- BUT I WANTED TO COME HERE TO ADD MY VOICE -- MY MOTHER FOR A LONG TIME WORKED AT ONE OF THOSE CENTERS THAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING AND FRESNO WE CALL IT THE MARJORIE MASONS AND IT'S A PLACE WHERE. FAR TOO OFTEN WOMEN AND KIDS ARE FORCED TO GO BECAUSE OF THE POVERTY AND EXPERIENCES FROM MY COMMUNITY. AND I KNOW THAT WE MUST DO MUCH MORE TO COMBAT THIS CRISIS. I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT A TO GENERATION MODEL TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE NOT LEARNING FROM THEIR PARENTS. AND PART OF THAT MUST COME FROM US ACKNOWLEDGING THE TRAUMA THAT THEY EXPERIENCE. FROM HAVING WATCHED THIS FIRST HAND HAVING SEEN IT. AND HAVING LEARNED FROM IT. WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY. AND HOUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS THAT TRAUMA REALLY WILL HELP US TO GIVE US THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED GOING FORWARD. BUT I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT IF I COULD TO REALLY DRILL INTO THIS ISSUE OF POVERTY. POVERTY ITSELF IS DRAMATIC. I'M HERE TODAY ON MY THIRTIETH OUR OF A FAST TO BRING. ATTENTION TO A POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN. A MOVEMENT IN OUR NATION. A MORAL REVIVAL. TOWARDS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING IN OUR COMMUNITIES EACH AND EVERY DAY IN OUR BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES. IN A FOR NOT WILLING TO STAND UP IN COMBAT THIS INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY THAT WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE SO MANY MILLIONAIRES. AND SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CANNOT PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. THAT I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO. STAND UP AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT WE SEE. THE CRIMES THAT ARE COMMITTED THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY OFTEN TIMES COME FROM THE MOST BASIC [inaudible] ISSUES. THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD TO PUT IN YOUR STOMACH. THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP AT NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE AND THERE IS MUCH MORE THAT WE CAN DO HAND WHILE I AM. HAPPY. TO GOTTEN THIS BUDGET PASSED US. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND PUSH GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND FOR ALL OF YOU TESTIFYING HERE TODAY THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. OKAY WILL BUT THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO AHEAD AND CALL UP OUR SECOND PANEL -- WE HAVE CHRISTENDOM SICK FROM THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO IN DOMESTIC WEILAND'S. TIED LAND FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ALARMING MORENO'S OF FROM THE YOLO COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME CHRIS THAT [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON -- THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING AND BRINGING ATTENTION TO AND ISSUE THAT. WE NEEDS TO BE IN THE LIMELIGHT AT HER HOME MORE DEDICATED FOCUS TO IT OFF SO I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU BEING HERE ON WHAT I KNOW IS A BUSY DAY HERE IN THE CAPITAL. MY NAME IS KRISTEN AND I AM THE PUBLIC POLICY MANAGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE ARE THE STATE WIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COALITION WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH LOCAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS ALL ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING IN. EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS [inaudible] SO. A TAD A BIT OF COMPLEXITY TO THIS DISCUSSION AROUND THE INTERSECTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND POVERTY WANNA START BY LAYING OUT SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS AND SUPPORTS THAT DO EXIST FOR SURVIVORS ALL STAR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HOME WITH SOME OF THOSE OVER ARCHING -- PROVISIONS THAT IMPACT ALL OF US HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN TRANSITION INTO DRILL DOWN INTO CALIFORNIA. COME AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE PRIOR PANEL AND AS MANY OF YOU SPOKE TO OF THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND POVERTY IS A COMPLICATED NUANCED INTERSECTION THAT HAS DEEP IMPACT. FINANCIAL ABUSE OCCURS AND 99% OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS AND IS OFTEN THE LEAST RECOGNIZED HIM LEAST VISIBLE PART OF THE ABUSE BUT IT CAN INCLUDE RUINING THE SURVIVORS CREDIT [inaudible] A CONTROLLING THEIR BEHAVIOR SO THAT THEY ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR EMPLOYMENT CONTROLLING MONEY WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD HIDING ASSETS FUNDS. ALL OF THOSE WAYS IN WHICH FINANCES CAN BE MANIPULATED AND WHICH LIVE SURVIVORS WITH THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE THEY CONVEY. WHAT DO YOU DO DO YOU LEAVE AN ABUSIVE SITUATION? AND UP HOMELESS TAKE YOUR CHILDREN INTO HOMELESSNESS DO YOU STAY IN A HOME WHERE THERE MIGHT BE VIOLENCE AND ABUSE THAT YOU HOPE YOU CAN FIND WAYS TO CONTROL IN MEDICAID. WHAT'S THE BETTER OPTION. THE TRUTH IS NEITHER ONE OF THOSE ARE GOOD OPTIONS AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE OPTION. SO THERE HAS BEEN DECADES OF WORK TO HELP ADDRESS THAT OWNS BUT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT WORK GOES BACK TO THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN THE FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND SERVICES ACT WAS PASSED. THIS IS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION ADMINISTERED THROUGH HHS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS AND SERVICES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT FUNDS. OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED SHELTERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND THEN IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE COME WHICH PERHAPS COMES AS NO SURPRISE TO ANY OF YOU THAT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF CALLS CHEN HOTLINE EACH AND EVERY YEAR COMES FROM CALIFORNIA. AND BUT THIS IS A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AVENUE OF SUPPORT AND RESOURCES FOR SURVIVORS AS THEY NEED. THE FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND SERVICES ACT ALSO HOPES TO FUND A SMALL AMOUNT OF PREVENTION WORK OF WHICH CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE I'M GRANT RECIPIENTS WE WORK ON THE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS -- IN LOS ANGELES AND MARIPOSAS TO OF OUR SMALL COMMUNITY IS DEDICATED TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE. CURRENTLY GRANTEES ARE WORKING ON COACHING BOYS INTO MEN CHANGING LOCKER ROOM CULTURE IN CHANGING THOSE SOCIAL NORMS THAT EXCESS OF THAT. YOUNG MAN HAVE HEALTHY MODELS OF WHAT HEALTHY MASCULINITY CAN LOOK LIKE. AND THE FAMILY BONDS PREVENTION AND SERVICES ACT IS SET TO BE REAUTHORIZED OF THIS YEAR HOME THERE'S LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN EXPIRED FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. HOME WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW BECAUSE IT LEAVES FUNDING VULNERABLE AND WE KNOW THAT -- PROGRAMS THAT ARE EXPIRED ARE OFTEN LESS LIKELY TO BE FUNDED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO WE ARE. ADVANCING. IN TERMS OF HOW THIS PROGRAM INTERSECTS WITH POVERTY. OF THE FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION SERVICES ACT DOLLARS ARE REALLY THE DOORS OPEN THE LIGHTS ON MONEY FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THOSE PROGRAMS ARE TASKED WITH PROVIDING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN RESPONSE AND THE FIFTY DOLLARS ARE THAT FUNDAMENTAL RESPONDS AND THE USER THE SHELTERS THAT ARE THERE TO ANSWER THAT IMMEDIATE CALL. WHEN SURVIVORS ARE SEEKING URGENCY ONE OF THE OTHER KEY PIECES OF LEGISLATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT -- FIRST PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND REAUTHORIZE EVERY FIVE YEARS FUNDS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT PROVIDES FOR A RANGE OF THINGS -- WITH ITS MOST RECENT REAUTHORIZATION AND TWENTY THIRTEEN INCLUDE SOME REALLY HARD FOUGHT. AND VITAL PROTECTIONS TO ADDRESS LGBT SURVIVORS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY SURVIVOR REGARDLESS OF THEIR GENDER EXPRESSION OR GENDER IDENTITY OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION CAN RECEIVE THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED WITHOUT FEAR OF DISCRIMINATION. IT INCLUDES KEY IMMIGRATION PROTECTIONS FOR IMMIGRANT SURVIVORS AND INCLUDES NEW TRIBAL PROVISIONS TO HELP WITH THE NATIVE COMMUNITIES AND TRIBES TO BETTER RESPOND TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT IS HAPPENING IN PARTICULAR BY NON NATIVE INDIVIDUALS AGAINST NATIVE WOMEN. AND THE US HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE KEY AREAS OF PROGRESS SO THAT THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT STATUTES HAVE MADE OF IT ALSO INCLUDES KEY HOUSING PROTECTIONS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PUBLIC HOUSING -- THE I KNOW HAS BEEN AN AREA OF MUCH DISCUSSION ALREADY AT THIS HEARING AROUND HOUSING. I COULD TALK ABOUT THAT ALL DAY BUT I WANT ADAM. YOU KNOW AT SOME OF THE OTHER PIECES WITH THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT THAT ARE MOST RELEVANT AS WE THINK ABOUT POVERTY IS THE FUNDING THAT COMES FROM THAT PROGRAM. THERE'S A FORMULA GRANT THAT IS ADMINISTERED THROUGH VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT IT COMES TO THE STATE TO HELP PROVIDE FUNDING FOR SERVICES LAW ENFORCEMENT PROSECUTORS AND COURTS. WE'VE HEARD ALREADY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROSECUTORIAL RESPONSES AND WHAT OUR COURT SYSTEMS CAN LOOK AND FEEL LIKE FOR SURVIVORS AND THE FUNDS THERE ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ADDRESS THAT BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. ONE OF THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM SERVICE BONDS INSTRUMENT ACT IS LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOR VICTIMS OF AS HAS BEEN STATED. ACCESSING AN ATTORNEY AS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY IF THE ABUSE HAS INCLUDED FINANCIAL ABUSE AND A SURVIVOR IS FACED WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES YOU HEARD BATHHOUSES SAY. HOW LITTLE DOLLARS OF INDIVIDUALS COMING INTO SHELTER HAVE? HOW DO YOU PAY FOR AN ATTORNEY WITH? ABSOLUTELY GO ASSISTANCE FOR VICTIMS PROGRAM HAS HELPED SURVIVORS HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA OVER 80% OF SURVIVORS OFTEN GO INTO COURT AND REPRESENTED. NOT OFTEN GO UP AGAINST THEIR ABUSER WHO DOES HAVE THOSE FINANCIAL MEANS TO PROVIDE FOR AN ATTORNEY. THERE'S ALSO FUNDING THERE FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING TO HELP CREATE A BRIDGE FROM EMERGENCY THIRTY OR SIXTY DAY SHELTER INTO LONGER TERM STABILITY AND PERMANENCE. AND THEN FINALLY ANOTHER ONE THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE RURAL GRANT PROGRAM HAVE BEEN THINK YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY. A HAM AND MANY OF YOU KNOW IS YOU REPRESENT RURAL AREAS HOW. HOW SCARCE RESOURCES CAN BE AND HOW POVERTY CAN BE CONCENTRATED OUR PERIL AREAS? SO ALL OF THESE GRANT PROGRAMS HAVE HELPED US TO MAKE TREMENDOUS STRIDES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR A GAPS CONTINUE TO REMAIN BUT THE IS ARE PROVIDING -- ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. AND THE THIRD OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT'LL TOUCH ON JUST BRIEFLY AS THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT. AND SO THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS BROADER THAN DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE THEM AND FUNDS A RANGE OF RESPONSES TO A RANGE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AND THESE ARE NON TAXPAYER DOLLARS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO THEIR FINES AND FEES COLLECTED FROM OFFENDERS LARGELY WHITE COLLAR CRIME AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND AND AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW THE IS DOLLARS -- HAVE RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT A NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE SEEN A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN NEW RESOURCE THOSE AS CONGRESS HAS. INCREASED THE APPROPRIATIONS. THOSE DOLLARS COME TO THE STATE IN TWO WAYS THEY COME HERE TO CALIFORNIA AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR SURVIVORS OF VICTIMS COMPENSATION. TIME AND THIS IS A VOTE TO REIMBURSE SURVIVORS FOR OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES I'M WHICH CAN BE TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT AS WE THINK ABOUT SURVIVORS. HAVE VERY LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES. I WILL SAY IT IS A REIMBURSEMENT MODEL OF WHICH MEANS THAT YOU NEED TO FIND THE FUNDS TO PAY FOR THOSE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES BEFORE YOU CAN BE REIMBURSED BUT TO BE ABLE TO BE MADE. FINANCIALLY HOLE ACCOUNTANTS TREMENDOUSLY IMPACT. COME OTHER FUNDS COME TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO ADMINISTER THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO QUITE A BIT WITH THOSE DOLLARS I WON'T. BY ANY STRETCH GET INTO ALL OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE THAT. SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS HAVE GONE TO SUPPLEMENT THE BIGGEST THE GRANTS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER PROGRAMS UP TO HELP INCREASE AND PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS WE KNOW THEY NEED. AND THEY ALSO USE THOSE FUNDS AREN'T TRANSITIONAL HOUSING MORE LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOR SURVIVORS RECOGNIZING THAT DEEP NEED -- AND PROVIDING HOUSING FIRST RESPONSES TAILORED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO IT REALLY INNOVATING ABOUT HOW WE PROTECT SURVIVORS FROM EVER FALLING INTO. AND THERE'S MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT ALL OF THOSE BUT AS WE LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT CALIFORNIA. ALL THIS FEDERAL POLICY IS COME TOGETHER TO HELP PROVIDE THE RESPONSES THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT SHELTER BASED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS IN A RANGE OF OTHERS PROVIDING SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS. AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD SOME SOUNDS BUT AS OF SONS IN FY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE SHELTER BASED PROGRAMS ANSWERED TOGETHER OVER TWO HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND HOTLINE CALL THEY PROVIDED. EMERGENCY SHELTER TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SURVIVORS AND THEIR CHILDREN. FOR A TOTAL OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND BAT BANG. SO THAT IS HOW MANY NIGHTS OF SHELTER THEY PROVIDE. I'M THEY PROVIDED EMERGENCY FOOD AND CLOTHING TO OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND ADULTS AND CHILDREN WHICH I THINK. SOME OF THE THOUGHTS THAT REALLY UNDERSCORES. HOW MUCH IN CRISIS IS SURVIVORS ARE WHEN FOOD AND CLOTHING? Z. LEVELLERS OF THE ESSENTIAL NEEDS THAT THERE MAY YEAH. AND DESPITE THE GREAT WORK THESE PROGRAMS ARE DOING THE GAPS REMAIN -- OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF UNMET NEED UNMET REQUEST FOR SHELTER WAS OVER THIRTY TWO THOUSAND REQUESTS WHICH AGAIN INTERSECTS WITH THAT. INCREDIBLE NEED WE SEE AROUND HOUSING AND A MUST PATENTS I'M. AS WE THINK ABOUT IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM NEEDS THE FOCUS IS OFTEN ON IMMEDIATE MEANS RIGHT WING HAVE BUILT A STRONG. EMERGENCY CRISIS RESPONSE THAT WITH EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND CRISIS HOTLINES. AND WHAT CAN OFTEN BE MOST CHALLENGING AS TO HOW TO HELP SURVIVORS THROUGH LONG TERM STABILITY. HOW DO WE HELP SURVIVORS HOUSING THAT IS PERMANENT AND AFFORDABLE AND STABLE? ESPECIALLY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND CALL. FOR ALL WHILE SURVIVORS ARE TRYING TO REBUILD THEIR CREDIT FI NEW EMPLOYMENT. DEAL FOR HIM DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING HELP THEIR CHILDREN BE A SAFE IN SCHOOL SO THESE LONG TERM SUPPORTS THE ABILITY FOR PROGRAMS. TO HAVE THAT TRANSITION TIME AND WORK WITH SURVIVORS OF LONG TERM IS INCREDIBLY ASSUMPTION. IT'S WHY SOME OF THE PROGRAMS LIKE THE CAL WORKS TEMPORARY HOUSING AND OTHER SUPPORTS ARE SO VITAL AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL WILL SPEAK AT HOME. TO THOSE IN GREATER DETAIL. SO UNDERLYING ALL OF THESE NEEDS IS REALLY THE ECONOMIC REALITY AND A YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW WORKS AND CALL FRESH FROM OTHERS BUT DIDN'T A LIFT UP THE FACT THAT THERE IS A RECENT REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL RESOURCE CENTER ON TO MY VIOLENCE. AND THAT WAS TITLED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURVIVING AND NOT SURVIVING AND THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF PUBLIC BENEFITS. IN THE ROLE REALLY IS THAT STARK COME BY NO MEANS IS THAT THE TITLE OF WITHOUT REPORT HYPERBOLIC. SO A FEW HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE REPORT THAT I JUST WANNA LIFT UP FOR YOU ALL. ASIDE. OF THE ADVOCATES THAT WERE SURVEYED NATIONWIDE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TEN OFTEN STOP THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS GOVERNING CULBERTSON CAO FRENCH. MORE THAN TWO THIRDS SAY THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS RELY ON TOWN OF TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. AT NEARLY 80% SAY THE SAME OF SNAP USER VITAL VITAL PROGRAMS. AND SURVIVORS THEMSELVES REPORTED AT THAT THEM UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE SERVICES WERE AND WHAT BENEFITS THEY COULD PROVIDE. AND BE ELIGIBLE FOR WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW THEY THOUGHT ABOUT LEAVING WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE ABLE TO LEAVE AND HOW TO DO SO WHERE TO GO. MANY SURVIVORS WHO FIND THEMSELVESAND POVERTY IN IN CRISIS HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF SKILL AND SKILLS THAT WILL MAKE THEM -- YOU KNOW ECONOMICALLY STABLE AND BUT THEY NEED THE INTERIM SUPPORT WHILE THEY DEAL WITH TRAUMA AND REESTABLISH THEIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ANTENNA FINS SNAP ARE KEY PARTS OF THAT. I'M THESE PROGRAMS GIVE THEM A MEANS TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHILE THEY BUILD THEIR LIFESPAN. THEM AND YET THEY ARE NOT WITHOUT THEIR CHALLENGES AND BEAT BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGE BUTTONS. SO LESS THAN HALF OF AND THE ADVOCATES SURVEYED SAID THAT DOMESTIC PHONE SURVIVORS WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE BENEFITS WHEN THEY NEED AT THEM. MANY SURVIVORS FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T ACCESS THOSE BENEFITS WITHOUT AN ADVOCATE WITHOUT WHICH SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE HIGH BARRIER TO ENTRY. AND HOW COMPLEX THOSE PROCESS USE OF SIMPLY APPLYING FOR AND RECEIVING THESE BENEFITS CAN BE UP. RESPONDENTS WHO WERE WORKING WITH LGBT -- SURVIVORS IMMIGRANT SURVIVORS THOSE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY ESPECIALLY RAISED UP THE CHALLENGES AND STRUGGLES OF ACCESSING AND THESE PROGRAMS TIME. ESPECIALLY FEELING THE SAFE IN DOING SO. ONE QUOTE THAT I'LL JUST SHARE FROM THE REPORT WAS THAT. TENER FAILS MOST WOMEN WITH CHILDREN BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS OPPOSED TO MANY HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH FIRST MALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING. THIS PROCESS IS FRUSTRATING AND INTRUSIVE FOR MOST AND DOESN'T ALLOW FOR REAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE REALITY FACED BY THE CYCLE OF POVERTY. SO NAY INCREDIBLE BRIDGE PROGRAM PROGRAMS THAT DO SO MUCH FOR SURVIVORS AND STILL -- MORE WORK REMAINS ARMS SO GLAD THAT WHERE HAVING THIS HEARING ABLE TO LIFT UP THE SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES. AND SOLUTIONS WE CAN WORK FOR ITSELF -- FOR FOR THIS HEARING AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS COMPLEX ISSUE. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. COULD YOU ACTUALLY JUST REALLY THAT QUOTE [inaudible] I KEPT [inaudible] SO. THE QUOTE IS TENER FAILS MOST WOMEN WITH CHILDREN BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS AND HAS TOO MANY HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH. FIRST SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING. THIS PROCESS IS FRUSTRATING AND INTRUSIVE FOR MOST. AND DOESN'T ALLOW FOR REAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE REALITY FACED BY THE CYCLE OF POVERTY. SO THE SURVEY THAT YOU PROVIDED INDICATED PEOPLE DO SEE THE VALUE OF IT. BUT THE VALUE IS OFFSET BY THE CUMBERSOME BURDENSOME INTRUSIVE NESS. THE LOAN AMOUNT OF THE BENEFITS THAT EVERY LOT OF MEMBERS FOR A LIMITED DIEM. BUT IT IS A BETTER TOOL THAN. NO TWO ABSOLUTELY ARE IT IS ESSENTIAL IT IS SORT OF PEOPLE RESORT TO IT. BUT IS VERY BURDENSOME DE. AVAIL THEMSELVES. AND YOU KNOW AGAIN I WILL SAY THIS WAS A NATIONAL SERVICE OF THOSE EXPERIENCES DIFFER. A STATE BY STATE PER OUT IMAGINE COUNTY BY COUNTY OF IN SOME WAYS BUT YES IT IS THE YOU KNOW LOW BENEFIT AMOUNTS -- IT IS A CHALLENGING PROCESS AT TIMES TO APPLY FOR AND THE KNOW WHEN THERE'S DOMESTIC FOUNDS INVOLVES AT HOME. TRIGGER SOME OF THE SPECIFIC HOW WORKS PROTECTIONS ARE TEN OF PROTECTIONS AFFECT HER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT YOU'RE AFFECT ADAM. I'M AND NOT SO HARD PROCESS OF THEM YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT THAT IS DONE AND I'M CAN BE DONE TO HELP MAKE THAT MORE COMFORTABLE BUT IT. CAN FOR SURVIVORS WHEN THEY'RE AND HAMA THEY END UP HAVING. TO SCHOOLS THAT TRAUMA AND ABUSE TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO. AND THAT CAN JUST BE ANOTHER ANOTHER BURDEN TAFFETA TELECAST WORKER ABOUT YOUR SITUATION. YOU VERY MUCH AND SHARE. THE CIVIC CENTER SO HOW HOW WHAT SUGGESTIONS WOULD YOU GIVE THIS BODY THE SELECT COMMITTEE. TO EXPLORE TO LOOK AT TRY TO REMOVE SOME THOSE THAT THAT PARTICULAR BAY AREA WHERE. ONE DON'T HAVE TO DISCLOSE BUT STILL RECEIVE THE KIND OF BENEFITS THAT. THAT INDIVIDUAL IS SEEKING. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE'S CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT SURVIVORS ARE EVEN AWARE THAT THERE'S A FAMILY VIOLENCE OPTION AS PART OF COLOR SINCE SO MAKING SURE THAT SURVIVORS GET THAT INFORMATION AND THAT. ALL COLOR X. APPLICANTS GET THAT INFORMATION WHEN THEY'RE APPLYING -- AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN SHARE THAT INFORMATION AT ANY TIME AND I THINK THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY DO NEED -- TO DISCLOSE TO BE ABLE TO TRIGGER -- THOSE PROTECTIONS INCLUDING STOPPING SOME OF THE CLOCKS ON CAL WORKS SINCE PERFECT FOR ACTIONS BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT ONGOING COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES. BROWN'S PROGRAMS ON HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT -- KISS WORKERS ARE CREATING A SAFE SPACE FOR SURVIVORS TO SHARE -- THAT THOSE DISCLOSURES ARE ABLE TO BE LIMITED TO THE SIMPLE INFORMATION OF I AM A SURVIVOR WITHOUT ASKING FOR EXPECTING YOU KNOW FULL DETAIL OF THE HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF TIME COULD CONTINUE TRAINING THAT KID. FROM IF I MAY NOT OWN OF THE LABOR BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK OTHER PRESENTERS. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE MERELY LOOK AT TO SEE ONE PICTURE. WE SEE THE WOMAN WHO'S BEEN A THE VICTIM WHAT ABOUT THE MAN BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AT MEN OUT THERE. WHO IT ALSO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- WHAT NUMBERS DO YOU HAVE AND ALSO IS THERE A GREAT APPREHENSIVE? ON THE AND MALES PART TO RECEIVE ANDTO ACCESS SOME OF THE SAME PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IN YOUR TESTIMONY. ABSOLUTELY -- ONE IN SEVEN MAN WILL EXPERIENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I'M OF THE NATIONWIDE STATISTIC. I THINK ABOUT IT. IT IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE THAT IT DOES OFTEN GET LEFT OUT OF THE MAIN NARRATIVE AROUND GNOSTIC VIOLENCE AND YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH THOMAS FOUND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE'S FACES FROM EMERGENCY SHELTER TO COUNSELING ARE -- COMFORTABLE INAPPROPRIATE FOR A PERSON OF ANY AGE UNDER. BUT I THINK THAT AS THE SOCIETAL STIGMA IS IMPORTANT TO KNOWLEDGE WE AS A SOCIETY HAVE OF USE AROUND MASCULINITY THAT DON'T MAKE SPACE. FOR OF ADMITTING VULNERABILITY ADMITTING THAT IT IS STILL HARDER FOR MALE VICTIMS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD FEEL LIKE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THEM AND SO DOES. AND AN ONGOING AREA THAT IT JUST REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK AND REALLY INTENTIONAL OUTREACH TO MAKE SURE THAT -- BELL SURVIVORS ARE ABLE TO COME FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THAT NEXT WE HAVE TODD PLANTED PROJECT DIRECTOR OF FAMILY DETERMINE AND EMPOWERMENT DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON AND SHE SAID ON TODD PLAN WITH CALIFORNIA PART IN SOCIAL SERVICES. ADEPTLY DIRECTOR FOR THE FAMILY IN CAJUN EMPOWERMENT DIVISION. WELL I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS IS THE CASE WITH THE OTHER WITNESSES TODAY. ARM I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT ON SOME OF THE MAJOR CDSS PROGRAMS AND HOW THEY SERVE. ON VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LISTING TO THE TESTIMONY ON THE FIRST PANEL AND A WITNESS HERE TODAY ARM I JUST JUST REMINDED ABOUT HOUSING EVERYONE HAS MENTIONED HOUSING IN THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING. IN THE CRISIS THAT THAT PUTS ON SO MANY CALIFORNIANS I IS JUST JUST OVERLAY SO MANY ISSUES THIS ONE INCLUDED. ON MY DIVISION DOES INCLUDE THE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS AND CIVIL RIGHTS BRANCH LA WHICH OVERSEES ON SOME OF THE HOUSING PROGRAMS IN OUR DEPARTMENT COURSE OUR PROGRAMS AT THE DEPARTMENT HOUSING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OTHER PLACES AS WELL -- TODAY LIKE IT'S I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON ON THE TWO MAJOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED ON THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM WHICH IS OUR VERSION OF THE FEDERAL TANF PROGRAM. AND A LITTLE BIT ON THE CAL FRESH PROGRAM ALSO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE TRAFFICKING AND CRIME VICTIMS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SOMETIMES CALLED TO SEE ABOUT. ON AND FINALLY WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME IMMIGRATION ISSUES AT THE AND TURNING FIRST TO CAL WORKS ARE AS AS I THINK YOU ALL KNOW IT'S OUR PROGRAM A CASH ASSISTANCE. AREN'T FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IT SERVES FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA AND NEARLY A MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND MOST OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE CHILDREN. AS A TALK ABOUT CAL WORKS INTEREST CAN TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT SORT OF CURRENT LAW AND THEN GET INTO A DISCUSSION OF WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGE AND CAL WORKS WHICH IS OF COURSE. YOUR LEGISLATION ON AB FIVE FIVE SEVEN WHICH BECAME CHAPTER. SIX NINETY ONE AND THEN I'LL CLOSE ON CAL WORKS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE BIT OF STATISTICAL INFORMATION. CURRENTLY ALL APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS OF CAL WORKS ARE INFORMED OF THE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WITH OPPORTUNITIES. TO CONFIDENTIALLY SELF IDENTIFY AND DISCLOSE ISSUES OF DOMESTIC ABUSE AND A SWORN STATEMENT IS SUFFICIENT. TO ESTABLISH THAT ABUSE. AND ESTABLISH THAT TYPE OF CASE VICTIMS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE OPTION TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO RECEIVE OF COMMUNICATION CORRESPONDENTS. ON AND CONFIDENTIALITY IS MAINTAINED AND THEY MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S HOME SAFE PROGRAM WHICH ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS THEM. TO KEEP THEIR ADDRESS ON COMPLETELY PRIVATE SENSUALLY ABI SERVE THROUGHOUT POST OFFICE BOX ON A SCREENING FOR DOMESTIC ABUSEAS PART OF THE CURRENT LAW COM ONLINE CAL WORKS APPRAISAL TOOL THERE ARE QUESTIONS IN THAT LATER I'LL GET TO SOME OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. ON SERVICES THE COUNSELING OR OFFER TO IMPACT INDIVIDUALS AND HOURS IN THESE ACTIVITIES IT CAN COUNT TOWARDS A CLIENT'S WELFARE TO WORK PARTICIPATION HOURS. ON CAL WORKS ALLOWS UNDER CURRENT LAW OF MANY PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS TO BE WAIVED OFFER INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY DOMESTIC ABUSE. ARE THESE INCLUDE TIME LIMIT ON RECEIVING CASH ASSISTANCE PATERNITY ESTABLISHMENT AND CHILD SUPPORT COOPERATION. IN FACT VIRTUALLY ANY PROGRAM REQUIREMENT CAN BE WAIVED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ASSETS INCOME AND DEPRIVATION -- THERE ARE ALSO IN CURRENT REGULATION AS ALL GET TO IN A MOMENT IN STATUTE THERE ARE -- EXCEPTIONS TO RULES AROUND SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AT IMMUNIZATION BUT CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO THOSE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ON EIGHTY FIVE FIVE SEVEN ON MADE SOME HUGE CHANGES SOME OF THOSE WENT INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY OTHERS ARE GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT NEXT MONTH. IN JANUARY ON CHANGES COM ESSENTIALLY CODIFYING A LOT OF OUR EXISTING PRACTICES AROUND ON A ESSENTIALLY WAIVERS OF REQUIREMENTS AROUND SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AND IMMUNIZATION THOSE ARE NOT CODIFIED ARE NOT PART OF THE LAW. NOT JUST A REGULATORY PRACTICE AND NOTICING REQUIREMENTS WERE ALSO UNCODIFIED AS WELL. BUT PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT MONTH ARM. UNDER AB. FIVE FIVE SEVEN AND THAT IS ON ESSENTIALLY A NEW ESSENTIALLY HOMELESSNESS BENEFIT THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WILL BE AVAILABLE HA TO THOSE WITH A SWORN STATEMENT. AND UP TO THIRTY TWO DAYS OF THAT BENEFIT WILL BE AVAILABLE. AND THE HUGE CHANGE IS. PREVIOUSLY A BARRIER TO GETTING TO CAL WORKS WAS THAT IF YOU. CAME DIRECTLY FROM AN ABUSER'S HOME. I TRY TO APPLY FOR CAL WORKS WE WOULD COUNT THE INCOME AND ASSETS OF THE ABUSER. AT AGAINST YOUR ARM AGAINST ESSENTIALLY OUR CASE THAT WASN'T THE CASE IF YOU'RE IN A SHELTER BUT YOU CAME DIRECTLY. SO PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES WERE SUFFERING THAT FOR POTENTIALLY THE RECEIPT OF THE THIRTY TWO DAYS ON THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE UP DOLLARS WHICH ARE SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY. AND THAT'LL BE BEING INCREASING TO EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY UNDER THE BUDGET AGREEMENT THE MISTER RIDICULOUS WELL AWARE OF THE THOSE ARE HUGE CHANGES THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THOSE THOSE ARE YET TO COME THROUGH AND THEY GOING TO AFFECT NEXT MONTH. A WE'RE HOPING TO GET OUT OUR GUIDANCE ON THAT WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD ON GETTING US STAKEHOLDER REVIEW ON HOPING TO HAVE THAT OUT VERY SOON THE OTHER CHANGES ON WE WERE MADE AND WERE REFLECTED IN ALL COUNTY LETTER THAT WAS ISSUED. BACK IN MARCH -- A FEW A FEW DATA POINTS ABOUT ABOUT CAL WORKS AND CLIENTS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ON AS I MENTIONED WE DO HAVE THE ONLINE CAL WORKS APPRAISAL TOOL. AND IT IS DESIGNED TO BE A VERY SENSITIVE TOOL AND ESSENTIALLY IT'S A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND DEPENDING OF THOSE QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED LEADS TO MORE QUESTIONS. AND A BASED ON THE APPROXIMATELY THAT APPRAISAL COM. ARE HOW ARE ARE ESSENTIALLY HAVING DOMESTIC ABUSE IDENTIFIED AS AN ISSUE THAT PERHAPS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THERE IS -- THAT THE CLIENT ARM. FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THAT. IT'D BEEN DISCUSSED AND A CHOICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE BECAUSE IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIAL BARRIER [inaudible] ARMED [inaudible] ANOTHER. PIECE OF DATA WHICH ACTUALLY IS MUCH THAT IS A MUCH SMALLER NUMBER IS FROM ARE ARE ESSENTIALLY AGGREGATE DATA FROM WITH THE COUNTY SUBMIT TO US IN THE WELFARE TO WORK. TWENTY FIVE ABOUT TWENTY TWO POINT 1% OF ENROLLEES IN WELFARE TO WORK ON ESSENTIALLY ARE ENGAGE. IN DOMESTIC ABUSE SERVICES AT ANY POINT IN TIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR MORE WITH TOUCH THAT THAN THE TWO POINT 1% THAT WOULD BE AN AVERAGE MONTHLY FIGURE. ABOUT POINT 5% RECEIVE A WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS THAT IS OF COURSE SIGNIFICANTLY LAST IN THE SOME OF THAT IS A FUNCTION OF IT BEING SENSITIVE AND NOTS WANTED ARM AND NOT NECESSARILY AYE AYE. A LACK OF REFERRALS BUT THAT IS KIND OF THE NEXT CHALLENGE FLORA FOR US THAT CDSS IS TRYING TO LOOK AT THAT ONLINE CAL WORKS APPRAISAL TOOL DATA AND NOT JUST FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR ALL SERVICES. AND SEEING HOW THAT WINDS UP WITH THE SERVICES CLIENTS ARE GETTING AND YOU KNOW THE CAL OR CAL WORKS ACCOUNTABILITY OUTCOMES REVIEW PROCESS AND COUNTY SELF ASSESSMENTS ARE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES AS WELL. INTO THE FUTURE. ON TURNING TOOK TURNING TO CAL FRESH CONFERENCES AGAIN OUR FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM -- FOR SERVING OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS ON ABOUT TWO MILLION HOUSEHOLDS COM AND ACROSS THE YEAR. ALTHOUGH IT ONLY SERVES FOUR MILLION AT A GIVEN MOMENT IN TIME WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MANY IT'S TOUCHED IN THE WHOLE YEAR IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE OR SIX MILLION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ON IT. OFFER MAYBE A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME -- VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR EXPEDITED SERVICE ON AND BE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY GET THE BENEFIT MORE QUICKLY [inaudible] ALSO ON A UNDER UNDER ARE UNDER OUR STATUTE ON VICTIMS OF ABUSE CAN ESTABLISH THEIR OWN HOUSEHOLD A POTENTIALLY RECEIVE UP TO ONE MONTH OF DUPLICATE DATE. SORT OF ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE OF SORT OF SEPARATING AND THE ABILITY TO GET SOME BENEFITS RIGHT AWAY [inaudible] ON THOSE ARE THOSE ARE OUR TWO BIGGEST PROGRAMS AND THOSE ARE SORT OF THE WAY THEY INTERACT AND TOUCH ON THAT OF COURSE INCOME MAINTENANCE AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT CAL WORKS DOES IS IS CRITICAL FOR NOT JUST THE DUMBEST VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT BUT ALL ALL LOW INCOME. RECIPIENTS AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST ALSO SAY THAT AT THE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST CAL ARTS PROGRAM OUR VERSION OF THE TANF PROGRAM. AT THE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ONLY ABOUT 18220% OF THE CHILDREN IN POVERTY IN THE CITY UNDER THE OFFICIAL POVERTY MEASURE ARE ACTUALLY SERVED IN THE NATIONAL TANF PROGRAM. BUT IN CALIFORNIA THAT NUMBERS HIGHER. IT'S IN THE IT'S IN THE 50% RANGE CAN'T THAT'S NOT AS HIGH AS IT WAS AND I'M NOT SAYING CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM IS PERFECT BUT WE ARE. PROUD IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ROBUST PROGRAM THAT WE DO HAVE [inaudible] ON TURNING TO ITEM TO TRAFFICKING AND CRIME VICTIMS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ESSENTIALLY ON CERTAIN ON CERTAIN -- IMMIGRANTS OF CERTAIN -- STERN TYPES OF STATUS ESSENTIALLY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL PROGRAMS BUT UNDER T. SIVA ESSENTIAL THAT'S A STATE ONLY PROGRAM ESTABLISHED OVER A DECADE AGO AND ESSENTIALLY IT PROVIDES STATE ONLY FUNDING IT SORT OF HELPS FILL. A GAP ARM SPECIFICALLY ON IT HELPS IMMIGRANTS WHO FLED WITH THE U. VISA PETITION I CAN QUALIFY FOR CASH ASSISTANCE FOOD BENEFITS EMPLOYMENT OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES. ON IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ON THE ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT SIXTY ONE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WILL BE SERVE STATEWIDE BY TO SEE ABOUT. AND MANY OF THOSE ALTHOUGH NOT ALL WILL BE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. FINALLY I JUST LIKE TO MENTION THAT ON THE YEAH THROUGH THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT OFFERS LEGAL SERVICES ON TO IMMIGRANTS AND AND THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMMES AND NONPROFITS. AND ESSENTIALLY VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE CAN BE ELIGIBLE TO PURSUE IMMIGRATION LEGAL REMEDIES THROUGH THROUGH OUR OR ON U. VISAS ARE SILENT AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR NONPROFIT CONTRACTORS. THOSE ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF HOW CALICO FOR HIS PROGRAMS INTERACT WITH DOMESTIC. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONYX WE HAVE LARA MANUALS EMPLOYMENT SERVICES SPECIALIST THREE OF YOLO COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY AND SO I I WORK BASICALLY I EMPLOYMENT SERVICES -- SPECIALIST FIELD COUNTY SO WHAT I DO IS THAT I WORK WITH ALL OF THE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS I HAVE BEEN CREATED AND I AM A CASE MANAGER FOR WELFARE TO WORK FAMILY STABILISATION THE HSP PROGRAM WHICH IS HOUSING ALLOCATION. AND LINKAGES THOSE ARE THE CASES THAT ARE LINKED WITH CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SO. WE DO SERVE PROBABLY SENT OUT WHAT. CAN BE QUITE ROLLED INTO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AT ANY MOMENT IN TIME. SO THEY MAY COME THROUGH AND WE DO IDENTIFY DOMESTIC -- VIOLENCE VICTIMS THROUGH THE INTAKE PROCESS WHEN THEY'RE COMING THROUGH INITIALLY APPLYING FOR CASH ASSISTANCE. ON ELIGIBILITY WILL PROVIDE THE BOTH THE D. V. INFORMING NOTICE SO THEY ARE TOLD ABOUT THE DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER THEM WITH REGARDS TO THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE RIGHT AT APPLICATION. WE DO RECEIVE REFERRALS FROM LIKE THE TV SHELTER SO WE HAVE A GOOD PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UP EMPOWER YOLO WHICH IS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CENTER. WITHIN YOLO COUNTY ON THEIR SHELTER -- WILLED. UP MOMS OR IF IT'S A FATHER I THOUGHT YOU HAVE A FATHER THAT I'M CURRENTLY WORKING WITH BUT THEY'D USE ON THE PLUS DEL LET US KNOW THAT ARE SENDING THEM OVER. TO THE WE GET KIND OF GUIDE THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS BECAUSE IT IT CAN BE A VERY. CONFUSING PROCESS FOR THEM IF THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ON AID SO IF THEY LET US KNOW WE KIND OF GOT HIM THROUGH THE PROCESS OR HELP THEM SET UP APPOINTMENTS WITH ELIGIBILITY TO WILL SPEAK WITH SUPERVISOR SO THAT THEY CAN KIND OF EXPEDITE PROCESS FOR THEM. WE ALSO RECEIVE REFERRALS FROM CHILD WELFARE SERVICES OF THEIR THOUGHTS THEY KNOW IT'S NOT RECEIVING ASSISTANCE THEY WILL SEND THEM TO US AS WELL SO THERE ARE WAYS OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING EXPEDITED SERVICES TO ENABLE THEM. TO ACCESS OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES UNTIL ONE OF THE THINGS IS BASICALLY AFTER SEEING THEIR SAFETY FIRST AND FOREMOST UP YOU KNOW DO THEY HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO BE AT IF THEY ARE NOT COMING FROM THE SHELTER. AND IF NOT CAN WE LOCATE ONE SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IS THROUGH THE HEALTH ALLOW OCCASION PROGRAM IS. IF THE FAMILIES ARE COMING IN THERE HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LEFT THE HOME ESSENTIALLY WE WILL PUT THEM IN A MOTEL SHORT TERM AND WORK WITH THEM. YOU KNOW TO ACHIEVE -- PERMIT HOUSING LATER ON BUT IT'S REALLY TAKING CARE OF THEM AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME AND WE DO LOOK AT REFERRING THEM TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOT JUST THE ADULTS BUT THE CHILDREN ITS WEALTH WITH THERE BEING IMPACTED. UP ONE OF THE THINGS TO CONSIDER IS THAT THERE MAY BE SUBSTANCE ABUSE -- GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME AS WELL SO THOSE ARE OTHER SERVICES THAT WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS BUT THE FIRST IS THE THE SHELTER ISSUE AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND THEN LATER ON REALLY. WE HAVE TO MEET THE CUSTOMER WHERE THEY'RE AT SO. IT'S AND THEN YOU KNOW IT JUST ADDRESSING BARRIERS ARE STE AS THEY COME UP ONE OF THE THINGS THINGS LIKE. THERE'S NOT TIMELINE YOU THEY HAVE TO BE READY FOR THOSE SERVICES WHEN THEY THEY COME AND SO THE OTHER THING THAT WE WILL ANOTHER WAY OF IDENTIFY THE IN AND IDENTIFYING THEM AS THROUGH SELF DISCLOSURE. AS WELL SO ON INDIA WE DO YOU APPRAISE SEVESO IT THROUGH THE UP ONLINE ON TELEWORK SUBBASAL TOLD THERE IS A SPECIFIC DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SECTION THAT. YOU KNOW TOUCHES UPON THOSE SO WE DO IDENTIFY THEM IN THAT REGARD AS WELL. ON A LOT OF THE TIMES THEY HAVE PISSED DOUBLE TRUST THE WORKER TO BE ABLE TO DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION AS WELL SO WE DO WORK WITH THEM AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. AND THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE OUR WHICH TO BE AS COMPREHENSIVE AS POSSIBLE SO BASICALLY UP MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES WE UP AND ROLLED UP MY FAMILY CIVILIZATION FOR THE WEEKEND. ACCESS OFFER MORE SERVICES TO THE CHILDREN AS WELL SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE ENTIRE FAMILY. ON TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS UP WE HAVE -- IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN EDUCATION THAT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE WORK TOWARDS IF THEY NEED WORK EXPERIENCE OR WE REFER THEM FOR SUBSIDIZED DEPLOYMENTS OR REALLY TRYING. TO WORK WITH THEM OVER TIME TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THEIR NEEDS BECAUSE EVENTUALLY WE WANT THEM TO BE. SELF SUSTAINING TO ESTABLISH THAT ON THE STABILITY AND BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR KIDDOS ON SO. IT'S REALLY A COMPREHENSIVE OF SERVICE PROVISION THAT INCLUDES ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. AND WE HAVE HAD SOME VERY SUCCESSFUL. YOU KNOW FAMILIES AYE HOW TWO LADIES WHO HAVE GONE OFF OF THE VAGUE NOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT. ON THE WAR PART OF A FAMILY SAY WELL ISOLATION. AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO LIKE OF ACTUAL PREVENTION FOR THEM FOR TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOME. AND SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID FOR THEM -- I HAVE ANOTHER ONE THAT I JUST AND WHEN SHE CAME THROUGH I MEAN SHE LITERALLY MOVED INTO A APARTMENT THAT WASN'T REALLY SUBSTANDARD BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT YOU COULD GET INTO NOW SHE'S IN OF MICE PLACE. SHE'S LIKE UNSAFE YOU KNOW I SHE'S GONNA COMPLETE HER NURSING PROGRAM IN. MAY. AND JOHN SHE'S HAPPY. THE REAL WORLD. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WILL BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE IF THE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR OF THIS SECOND PANEL SURE. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. MY QUESTION WAS FOR MISS MINIONS AND AGAIN I WANT TO LOOK AT THE TWO GENERATION MODEL YOU SAID THAT THERE WERE SERVICES THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE CHILDREN CAN YOU BE MORE EXPLICIT. WORD I THAT OF SCREENINGS DO WE DO HOW DO WE HELP TO IDENTIFY TRAUMA. WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING DONE AND DOES THERE NEED TO BE SOME STRENGTHENING? TO MAKE SURE THAT THE KIDS ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OFFICE WHAT. DO WE ARE OFFERING SERVICES THEIR FAMILY STABLE ISOLATION THE WINDOW ROLLED UP FAMILIES AND FAMILY STABILIZATION AYE WE DO REFER THAT CHILDREN. TO RECEIVE COUNSELLING SERVICES BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE OFFERING THEM -- YEAH EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES TO KIND OF HELP THEM. WITH THEIR EXCITING WHAT NOT SO FOR THIS IS ONE OF MY COWORKERS AND THAT PAIN -- FOR UP WRITING LESSONS FOR THE KIDDO AND THAT REALLY HELPED THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ANIMALS LET'S THERAPY FOR THEM AS WELL. AND SO THEY'RE BENEFITING FROM THAT SO IT'S REALLY. SHOWING THEM A DIFFERENT WAY. OF OF LIFE ESSENTIALLY SO KIND OF LETTING THEM KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT'S DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WHAT YOU EXPERIENCE BEFORE BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER. YOU KNOW THAT IT WILL ESTABLISH IN A SUPPORT NETWORK FOR THEM AS WELL SO THAT THEY CAN RELY ON SO THEY CAN. ON HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND JUST DIFFERENT ROLE MODELS. REVEAL FOLLOW UP WITH MISTER BLAND THEN IS THERE A SCREENING MODALITY IS THERE A TOOL THAT WE COULD USE THAT WOULD HELP REALLY GOOD QUESTION I MEAN IT REALLY REALLY ARE SCREENING TOOLS FOCUS ON THE ADULT WHILE THE FAMILY STABILIZATION ONE CLEARLY WAS DESIGNED. IT WAS SORT A BEFORE THE TO CHEN NAME WAS REALLY SO COMMON WE DIDN'T CALL IT TO CHEN THEN BUT IT DOES LOOK AT SERVICES FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. IT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT ABOUT HOW WELL DO WE SCREEN BEYOND WHAT ACCOUNT IS DOING AND AND WHAT THE PARENTS ARE CHOOSING TO DISCLOSE ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN'S NEEDS AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN'S NEEDS OF FACT. ON THAT I THINK. I THINK IT INTERESTING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL DEBATE IS ON POTENTIALLY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDING CHILD COM. REDUCING CHILD POVERTY AS POTENTIALLY A GOAL OF THE TANF PROGRAM IS NOT CURRENTLY ON BUT I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE VERSION THAT I'VE SEEN OF THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SPEAK IN TERMS OF ONLY THINKING ABOUT CHILD POVERTY IN TERMS OF THEIR PARENTS INCOME BUT IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. THE CHILDREN HAVE SO MANY MORE NEED SO I HOPE OF CONGRESS IS THINKING OF ADDING THAT KIND OF THING THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA -- THEY CAN THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE THE CHILDREN'S NEEDS BUT YOU RAISE A REALLY GOOD QUESTION NOT BRING THAT BACK TO MY ON MY TEAM CONGRESS HAVE PROBLEM. AT YOU KNOW I'D I'D BRING IT UP AGAIN I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT MARJORIE MASON CENTER I'M A I'M A BIG FAN OF THEM IN THEIR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND A YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE DOES IS SHE SCREAMS FOR ASUS. FOR EVERY CHILD WHO COMES THROUGH FOR THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THE TRAUMA THAT THEY'RE EXPOSED. TO I WONDER IF THERE'S A ROLE FOUR PIECES TO PLAY IN TERMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT [inaudible] CONTINUING A A TREND TO SECOND GENERATION THOUGH IT MAY ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO NIP IN THE BUD AND IDENTIFY THE TRAUMA AND GIVE THEM THE RESILIENCY ENCRYPTING. OKAY. REAL QUICK TAKE AWAY WHAT CAN WE DO TO TO HELP MAKE THINGS BETTER MISS WILLIAMS [inaudible] HOUSING. RIGHT NOW I MEAN WE HAVE THE YOU KNOW IF YOU. WE WERE TALKING TO ALLOW. YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF THINGS. AND IT'S REALLY [inaudible] NOBODY EVER [inaudible] VETERAN TRYING TO NEGOTIATE -- SO THAT THEY WON'T REMOVE IT FROM THE RECORDS AND EVEN THEN YOU KNOW A LOT OF IT. FOR A PARTICIPANTS TO PAY OR BURN THREE TIMES THE RENT. I DON'T THINK FAUCETS BY IT'S JUST. BUT RIGHT NOW A ONE BEDROOM YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS DENIES THAT. IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY COULD POINT MADE IN THERE TO PEOPLE ON THE HOUSEHOLD. SILICON ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SOMETHING DOLLARS THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD. TO PAY THE RENT AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT TIME [inaudible] I THINK [inaudible] MR BLACK. I WAS GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING AT THE I THINK I THINK HOUSING HOW THEY TAKE IT TAKEN FROM BOTH DIRECTIONS I MEAN I IN OUR PROGRAMS -- DEAL WITH SUBSIDIES THEY DEAL WITH ISSUES AROUND BARRIERS AND WORKING WITH LANDLORDS IT AND THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT AND AND AND YOU KNOW THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE HAVE GROWN AND AND WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S INVESTMENTS IN THEM. ARE BUT ALSO ISSUES A BIGGER ISSUES THAT ARE THE GO BEYOND THIS COMMITTEE AND AND THIS GROUP OF A NO OF SUPPLY AND TO AND CONSTRUCTION AND AND DENSITY. AND AND JUST SORT OF BRINGING -- BRINGING UP BRINGING BRING THE PRICE OF HOUSING NOT DOWN THROUGH SUPPLY -- THIS IS JUST IT'S JUST A HUGE ISSUE. AND I JUST PUT IT. WE HAVE A MURPHY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT RIGHT ACROSS FROM OUR OFFICE -- A LA COUNTY THERE WERE. THREE HUNDRED TRUE OR INTERESTS. UP FOR FORTY EIGHT UNITS WHILE OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING SO I MEAN YOU'RE LOOKING AT FORTY EIGHT UNITS AND YOU HAVE. SIX HUNDRED JUST YOU KNOW INTEREST. APPLICATIONS THROUGH THAT'S NOT EVEN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE APPLYING FOR THOSE UNITS. ON BUT THERE'S REALLY A GREAT DISPARITY WHEN IT COMES TO THAT AND THEN THE THERE ARE SOME OTHER -- SPECIALIZED YOU KNOW UNITS BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW -- DISABILITY VERIFICATIONS TO QUALIFY FOR THOSE SOCIALIST SO IT. WE SAID WE UNDERSTAND HOUSING AND SO THIS LEGISLATURE AMONG A SELECT COMMITTEE UNTIL HOUSING. AND SO -- WHEN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE GOT SOME MONEY -- DEDICATED TO HOUSE AND WE HAVE TO DO. A LOT MORE AND SO CERTAINLY WILL BE ABLE TO SHARE SOME OF THINGS THAT COME OUT OF THIS HEARING -- WITH THOSE COMMITTEE WITH COMMITTEE CHAIR OF HIS DAVID CHIU OF HEALTH FOR THEY CAN CONSIDER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED THAT HELPS US GET A LITTLE CLOSER TO TRY TO RESOLVE. OF THIS MUCH BIGGER ISSUE SO WE WANT THANK. PRESENT IS THAT THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. NEXT ONE A CALL UP OUR NEXT IS GIVEN ROUND. WHEN A CALL UP OUR NEXT PANEL WHERE COULD PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BE STRENGTHENED TO BETTER SERVE SURVIVORS? I WANNA CALL OF REPRESENTATIVE WHO WAS SELF INTRODUCED THEMSELVES -- WE HAVE THE PLOY ABILITY CASE MANAGE AND SAFE ALTERNATIVE VIOLENCE ENVIRONMENTS. I WOULD YOU PLEASE COME FORTH FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT ADVOCATES WAVED TO PLEASE COME FORWARD AND ALSO POLICY ADVOCATES WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THANK YOU LADIES FOR JOINING US OUR CHAIR WILL BE BACK IN MOMENTARILY SHE HAD A GO AND PRESENT A BILL IN COMMITTEE. AYE WE PLAY A NUMBER TO FOR ROLES HERE SO WE'LL BE IN AND OUT THINGS OF THAT NATURE. SO -- PLEASE SOBRE INTRODUCE [inaudible] AND KELLY. SO HI THERE THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING ME IN THE GEN MY AUNT KELLY KEEP. PLAYABILITY CASE MANAGER AT SAY IF. DAVID IS IT SAFE ALTERNATIVES A VIOLIN FIREMEN'S RIGHT NONPROFIT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGENCY ALAMEDA COUNTY. SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE IS OUR SAFE HOUSE OR EMPOWERMENT CENTER. WHERE CLIENTS CAN GO AND RECEIVE? A WALK IN SUPPORT SERVICES AND CASE MANAGEMENT WE ALSO HAVE A CLINICAL COUNTING DEPARTMENT AND ARE YOU SERVICES DEPARTMENT SO -- MY ROLE AT THE EMPLOYABILITY CASE MANAGERS THAT I'M ON THE GROUND EVERY DAY IN THE SHELTER WORKING WITH THE CLIENTS AND HELPING THEM APPLY FOR BENEFITS AND RESOLVE ANY ISSUES. THAT COME UP WITH THEIR BENEFITS PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE A LIFELINE TO OUR CLIENTS ARE EXPERIENCING TRAUMA AND TRANSITION. I DEVELOPED A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE COUNTY'S ELIGIBILITY PROCESS RULES AND EXEMPTIONS PERTAINING TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS. OFTENTIMES WHEN A CLIENT NEEDS COUNTY BENEFITS IS THEIR FIRST TIME NAVIGATING THE SOCIAL SERVICES SYSTEM. THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO WALK THROUGH THE PROCESS HAND IN HAND WITH A SURVIVOR. TO BEGIN I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY [inaudible] SO. I HAVE EVERYTHING CLIENT WHO'S RELUCTANT TO APPLY FOR COUNTY BENEFITS BECAUSE HER ABUSER HAD THREATENED TO KILL HER. IF THE COUNTY CAME AFTER HIM FOR CHILD SUPPORT. NINE SO AFTER CONNECTING WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT SOCIAL SERVICES AND EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM I WAS PROVIDED INFORMATION FOR THE CLIENT TO FILE A GOOD CAUSE FORM THAT WOULD EXEMPT HER FROM THE CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTION CARMEN. SO THE CLIENT HAD TAKE THOUGHT HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK WHICH WAS ALREADY IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING HER JOB BECAUSE OF THE MISTAKES FROM ALL THE OTHER PRIOR DOMESTIC ROUTES INCIDENCES. THE CLIENT APPLIED AND DURING THAT PROCESS THE CLAIM WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE WORKER WITH THE ABUSERS INFORMATION ANYWAYS WHICH MADE HER VERY NERVOUS. ULTIMATELY SHE WITH THE NIGHT THE COUNTY BENEFITS. SO WITH THAT I COUNTY BENEFITS BECAUSE OF HER TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR A MONTH INCOME WHAT'S TOO HIGH. SO THIS IS THE MOTHER OF THREE DO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE FAIR MARKET RATE FOR STUDIO APARTMENT ALAMEDA COUNTY IT'S EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY EVEN AFTER THE KIND EXPLAINE HER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION AND THAT USE CURRENTLY HOMELESS IN OUR SHELTER. IT WOULD DISCOVERED IN A PROCESS THAT THE COUNTY HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN CALCULATING HER BENEFITS FROM. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IS NOW REQUIRING HER TO PAY BACK THE OVERPAYMENT EVEN KNOW IF THE COUNTY AIR. SINCE THE KIND WITH THE NIGHT BENEFITS SHE'S NOW INELIGIBLE FOR THE COUNTY SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE SERVICES WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HER TO CONTINUE WORKING FULL TIME. SO THE STORY IS NOT UNIQUE. THERE ARE OTHER OTHER EXAMPLES I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THAT OUR DAY TO DAY CHALLENGES I OFTEN SEE. CLIENTS LANGUAGES ARE NOT ALWAYS ACCOMMODATED WITH SOCIAL SERVICES. I HAD A SPANISH SPEAKING QUITE RECENTLY GOING TO STILL CERTAIN SOCIAL SERVICES AN OFFERING INTERPRETER. THERE IT'S ALL JUST DEVELOP THE PAPERWORK AND BRING IT BACK. THE CLIENTS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO FILL IT OUT I WOULD LIKE INTERPRETER. THERE ARE TOLD WE DON'T HAVE AN INTERPRETER SO YOU CAN JUST COME BACK ANOTHER DAY. SO FOR OTHER VERY THREE THIN CLIENTS ARE ALSO DENIED BENEFITS. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ONCE THE COURT MANDATES CHILD SUPPORT -- DECLINES LOSE THEIR BENEFITS BECAUSE IT IS SEEN AS AN ALTERNATIVE -- SOURCE OF INCOME. SO THEN THE CLIENT HAS TO RELY ON THEIR VIEWS HERE TO PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT ON TIME OR IF AT ALL. WHICH THEN IS PERPETUATING THE CYCLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SO I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS LIKE BE PUT IN PLACE. AND THAT COULD EASE SOME OF THE HARDSHIP FOR SURVIVORS THAT WE WORK WITH. FOR ONE PROVIDING SOCIAL SERVICE WORKERS WITH MORE EXTENSIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TRAININGS. THIS WILL HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE SURVIVOR MORIN HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THE CRIME MAY BE RELUCTANT TO SHARE INFORMATION ARE WHY THE KIND IS PRESENTING THE WAY THAT THEY DO. THIS WOULD HELP COUNTY WORKERS BECOME MORE COMPASSIONATE AND SENSITIVE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS. I WAS ON THE PHONE RECENTLY THIS WEEK WITH -- WITH THE COUNTY WORKER AND WITH MY CLIENT. IN MY CLIENT WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT THE ABUSE A LITTLE BIT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CRIME WAS NERVOUS ABOUT SHARING THAT SHE WAS IN A SHELTER. SO THE CLIMATE BEGAN TO CRY AND THE WORKERS. PLAYERS UP TOGETHER [inaudible] SO. IN MY EXPERIENCE. THEIR SITUATIONS WHERE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE NOT MADE AWARE OF INTERNAL PROCESSES EXEMPTIONS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS. THE INCONSISTENCY IS THE MOST CHALLENGING. FOR INSTANCE THE CLIENT HAD THEIR BENEFIT SANCTION FOR NOT PARTICIPATING THE WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM WHEN IN FACT THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS. SOME CLIENTS ARE TONIGHT EMERGENCY CATCH IT IN FOOD STAFF BECAUSE THEY ARE TOLD ONCE THEY'RE IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER BUT THEY DON'T QUALIFY. CLIENTS DO NOT STAY WITH ONE CASEWORKER THEREABOUTS TO DALY WORKERS THEREFORE HAVING TO REPEAT THEIR STORY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THEREFORE IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE A UNIVERSAL FROM PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IMPLEMENTING ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO PROVIDE WORKERS WITH INFORMATION RESOURCES TO BETTER SERVE THE SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE OVERALL APPLICATION PROCESS COULD BE ALSO GREATLY SIMPLIFIED. MOST PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND LEGAL JARGON NUYS ON SOCIAL SERVICES PAPERWORK. I OR AGENCY WE SERVE CLIENTS FROM A DIVERSE EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS THEREFORE WE DEVELOP OUR DOCUMENTS TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC. CLIENTS THAT NEED TO GET BIRTH CERTIFICATES OF SECURITY CARDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD ELIGIBILITY PROCESS. SIMPLIFYING THE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION NEEDED. FOR SOMEONE TO RECEIVE BENEFITS COULD SPEED UP THE PROCESS MAKING IT THE BENEFITS IN THE SAME DAY. ANOTHER SOLUTION COULD BE EXTENDING SOCIAL SERVICES HOURS ARE ADDING WEEKENDS TO A COMIC CLIENTS WHO WORK OR HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL. GOING TO SOCIAL SERVICES IS AN ALL DAY EVENT CLIENTS HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO GO TO WORK TAKE THE KIDS TO SCHOOL ORBIT GO GET BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH SOME EXPERT I PROCESSES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE LIKE AT THE APPLICATION BEING ONLINE IF YOU DO FILE THE ONLINE APPLICATION IT TAKES THIRTY DAY THING STILL HAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE COUNTY INTO AN IN PERSON INTERVIEW. ALSO CAL WORKS IS BASED OFF THE FEDERAL PARTY LIMIT WHICH FOR FAMILY FOREST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. CALATHEA GUIDELINES ARE BASED OFF THE CLIENT'S GROWTH INCOME AND NOT THEY'RE NOT WORTH NOT WHAT THEY TAKE HOME. HEARING CALIFRNIA A FAMILY FOR MAY NOT EXCEED GROSSLY. FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. SO IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IF THEY INCOME LIMIT WITH BASED OFF OF OUR STATE OR EVEN -- CERTAIN COUNTY POVERTY LIMITS IT WOULD SOLUTION COULD BE INCREASING WILL -- INCOME LEVEL TO REFLECT THE REALITY OF THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. INCREASING THE INCOME LIMIT FOR ELIGIBILITY WITH SUPPORT THOSE WHO MAKE TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE MANY CLIENTS HAVE BEEN DENIED SOME OF MY CLIENTS HAVE BEEN DENIED BECAUSE THEY EXCEED THE ELIGIBILITY INCOME LIMIT I HAVE CLIENTS BEING THE NIGHT FOR MAKING ONE DOLLAR OVER THIS LIMIT AMOUNT. ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS LIKE CLIENTS WHO OWN CARS ARE OFTEN AYE BECAUSE THE EXCEED THE ASSET LIMIT. CLIENTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE USES THESE CARS TO GET TO WORK TAKE TAKE TAKE THE KIDS TO SCHOOL OR IT'S THEIR ONLY SOURCE OF HOUSING IN SHELTERS ARE FULL. IN OUR COUNTY IN MY COUNTY ALAMEDA COUNTY WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE THE CALVERTS COLLABORATIVE WHICH IS THE GROUP AT THE MATH OF BROWN'S PROVIDERS FUNDED BY CAO WORK THAT MEET TOGETHER TO BRIBE TO PROVIDE. COORDINATING SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS THIS COLLABORATION IT'S HELPFUL BUT NOT ENOUGH. HOWEVER MANY YEARS AGO ARE COUNTY HAD SPECIALLY TRAINED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATES WHO WORKED AT SOCIAL SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY ARE COUNTY HAD AN ACTUAL DOMESTIC BALLOT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. REESTABLISHING THE ADVOCATES ROLES IN THIS COMING ACROSS COOPERATE AND CROSS TRAIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. WE FINISHED YET THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WHAT WAS A COLLABORATIVE CALL. THE DVD COLLABORATIVE DEEP IN HIS DILLON EXISTENCE. THAT EVEN COVERED IT. THEY'VE BEEN IS STILL MEET. NOT OFTEN ENOUGH. OKAY BUT YOU DO WORK YOU DO WORK IN A CLUB TO FATTEN TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES ON THE BED AND TRY TO ADDRESS ON THESE BEARS AS YOU BROUGHT OUT. THAT OTHER COUNTIES ARE ARE EXPERIENCING YEAH AYE YOU AND BE GOOD IF YOU WOULD PROVIDE US WITH THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY. TRY TO PASS ALONG THIS IN HOPES THAT ONE OTHER COUNTIES COULD TRY TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT YOU CAN BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER TO TRY. TO TEAR DOWN SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS THAT YOU BROUGHT FORWARD -- CERTAINLY THEY SEEM REASONABLE A PERSON MAKING ONE DOLLAR OVER OR OWNING A CAR I MEAN COME ON WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT YUMMY ONES ABILITY TO GET AROUND. TO TAKE PICTURES OF DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS AND THINGS OF A TO BUY GROCERIES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE RIGHT -- AND THAT'S NOT BE A A A A BARRIER OR A STRIKE AGAINST YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FORTUNE OF HAVING OWNING A VEHICLE AND SO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I THINK A A COLLABORATIVE GROUP WORKGROUP. COMING TOGETHER -- TO SHARE SOME OF THESE IDEALS IT HELPED TEAR DOWN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BEAR SO IF YOU HAVE A TEMPLATE THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH US THEN CERTAINLY LOBBY MORE THAT HAPPENED I'M SURE -- SPEAK INTAKE A TICKET CHALLENGES SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE CHAIRWOMAN WILL BE HAPPY TO HELP INSTIGATE SOME OF THESE AND IN OTHER AREAS WHERE WE CAN TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE BARRIERS I THINK IS A WONDERFUL IDEA. GREAT THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU. THIS AND BRING BACK TO COMMITTEES THIS ANYONE OF THE SCHOOL YOU HAVE QUESTION. IBM SAID IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE JUST CONVEY THAT YOUR SUMMARY OUTLINE -- THE THOSE POINTS YOU WENT THROUGH I THINK THERE WOULD BE A GOOD TO MEMORIALIZE THAT FOR THE COMMITTEE. AND IF YOU HAVE EXAMPLES YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW SOME OF YOUR INTAKE FORMS. ARE DESIGNED THE KIND OF GET TO THE HEART OF THE INFORMATION THE LESS CUMBERSOME WAY. YOU MIGHT SHARE SOME SAMPLES OF HOW YOU TAKE INFORMATION. AND HOW THAT MATCHES UP WITH A STATE FORM CAN HELP US. FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE OF HILL OUR SYSTEMS THEMSELVES -- A BARRIER YEAH I'M REALLY SIMPLIFYING THE LANGUAGE THAT THE SYSTEM HAS FORCED ALLOW PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS CAN BE A VERY. AND I THINK JUST COME. PROVIDING HOW HOW YOU'VE EVOLVED IT AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. I THINK THAT WOULD HELP US. I THINK IF. YOU. NECKS PRESENTER. HI MY NAME IS SACRIFICE ANJA I AM I HAVE WORKED WITH WE'VE SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN THE CAPACITY AS A VOLUNTEER IN AN EMPLOYEE ON THE TOPICS OF FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT AND FINANCIAL ABUSE. I RETIRED FROM TWENTY YEARS IN MORTGAGE BANKING IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN BEGAN RESEARCHING THE TOPIC OF FINANCIAL ABUSE. AFTER WHAT I'D SEEN IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES HER SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN FINANCIAL ABUSE. I WAS ENERGIZED TO EXPLORE THE ARENA AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP AT THE TIME THERE WAS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ON THE TOPIC BUT A FEW STATS THAT KEPT COMING UP WHICH CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WERE. AND STILL ARE THESE. 98299% OF VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NATIONWIDE HAVE BEEN FINANCIALLY BEAST. WOMEN LIVING IN POVERTY THAT'S EARNING UNDER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR. ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO SUFFER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ONE OF IF NOT THE LEADING CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS AMONG WOMEN IN OUR NATION. ONE IN THREE FAMILIES ENTERING SHELTERS SITE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS THE CAUSE. AND YET EIGHT IN TEN SURVIVORS LEAVE EMERGENCY SHELTERS WITHOUT A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO GO. DENNIS DOT THAT REALLY HAS ME HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY IS THE ONE THAT PROVES BEING HERE IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO WITH MY TIME. VICTIMS WHO WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC STABILITY HAVE 70% INCREASE IN SUCCESSFUL SURVIVORSHIP. THAT 70%. WHAT I DISCOVERED WAS THAT SAFETY FOR LOW INCOME SURVIVORS WAS YOUR? HAS REAL MONETARY COSTS INCLUDING RELOCATION NEW OR INCREASED RENT [inaudible] TRANSPORTATION CHILDCARE QUARTER LEGAL FEES AND TIME SPENT ACCESSING ADVOCACY AND SERVICES. THESE ARE OFTEN HARD COSTS INFLEXIBLE TO INCOME RESTRICTIONS. THEY REQUIRE SURVIVORS TO MAKE UNTENABLE CHOICES. CHOICES BETWEEN VIOLENCE AND POVERTY. COMPOUNDING THESE EFFECTS ABUSIVE PARTNERS YOU SYSTEMATIC TACTICS OF CONTROL IN CORE XIN. FINANCIAL ABUSERS EXPLOIT THEIR PARTNERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF METHODS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED. TO LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO WORKER RETAINED EARNINGS MAINTAINING CONTROL OF ALL PROPERTY IN SAVINGS FORCING THEM INTO COURSE DEBT AND SABOTAGING EMPLOYMENT. MOST OFTEN THE ABUSER KEEPS TIGHT CONTROLS ON THE INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE TO THE VICTIM REGARDING THEIR FINANCIAL WELL BEING. HIDING ALL DATA ON DEBT SAVINGS AND CREDIT STANDINGS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL THOUGH IS ALWAYS TO LIMIT THE AUTONOMY OF THEIR PARTNER. INTRIGUED BY THIS INFORMATION I SOUGHT EDUCATION ON THE TOPIC AND FOUND VERY FEW OPTIONS TO LEARN MORE. ONE GROUP I FOUND WAS OUT OF WASHINGTON DC. THE CENTER FOR SURVIVORS AGENCY AND JUSTICE. THEY HAD STARTED TO DEVELOP A CURRICULUM WHICH TO THIS DAY HAS PROVED TO BE THE MOST CUTTING EDGE LIBRARY OF INFORMATION ON THE TOPIC I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I LOOKED FOR RESOURCES WITHIN SACRAMENTO IN CALIFORNIA AND COMING UP NEARLY EMPTY HANDED WE CREATED A FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT CLASS THAT WE'VE. IN THE CLASS WE EDUCATED PEOPLE ON THE BASICS OF CREDIT AND BUDGETING. HOW TO IDENTIFY ISSUES? WHAT TO DO TO PROTECT ONESELF FROM IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD AND HOW TO START THE SLOW PARTS PROCESS OF REBUILDING THE FINANCIAL PICTURE? WE BEGAN PULLING CREDIT THROUGH THE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT DOT COM SITE WHICH ALLOWS ALL AMERICANS FREE ACCESS TO CREDIT REPORT EACH YEAR. AND FOUND THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF ITS VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COULDN'T GET PAST THE BASIC SECURITY QUESTIONS TO ACCESS CREDIT. DUE TO FINANCIAL ABUSE. IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR CREDIT TO ACCESS TO CREDIT. THAT BEING THE CASE WE SOUGHT OUT A PORTAL FOR CREDIT REVIEW THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ACCESS CREDIT REPORTS WITHOUT THE SECURITY QUESTIONS AND FOUND OUT PLATFORM. WITH TRANS UNION IN A PORTAL THEY'D BEEN USING FOR CHILDREN EATING AGING OUT OF THE FOSTER SYSTEM. WITH THE AID IT STATE CONTROLLER WE ARE ABLE TO GET THEM TO GRANT US ACCESS FOR WE'VE CLIENTS. SO THAT WE COULD HAVE ACCESS TO REVIEW DISPUTE CREDIT ITEMS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL. YOU CAN ALSO GIVE A COPY OF THE CREDIT REPORT TO THE CLIENT SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE RECORD. AND BEGIN THE LONG JOURNEY OF ADDRESSING THE CREDIT ISSUE. THIS MADE WE'VE THE FIRST AGENCY IN THE COUNTRY TO USE THIS FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. NOW YOU'LL PROBABLY BE MOST INTERESTED IN IS THE ACTUAL WORK I'VE BEEN DOING WITH INDIVIDUALS. MOST LIKELY WHY WAS ASKED HERE TODAY AS I AM IN A ELITE SLASH SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO DO WHAT I DO IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE ACROSS THE STATE. OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS I'VE MET WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WOMEN IN SACRAMENTO WHO HAVE SUFFERED FINANCIAL ABUSE. I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING FROM SIMPLE LATE PAYMENTS TO COURSE DATA MORTGAGES. IDENTITY THEFT RESULTING IN CREDIT DEBT AND TENS OF THOUSANDS AND ADULTS USING CHILDREN'S IDENTITY TO FILE TAXES IN CREATE CREDIT PROFILES. WHAT I TYPICALLY SEE A CLIENT AND THEY MAY HAVE ALL OR ONE OR? SEVERAL. NO BANK ACCOUNT OR ACCESS TO FUNDS. MANY TIMES THEY FIND THEY OWE MONEY TO A BANK AND THEREFORE CAN'T GET A BANK ACCOUNT AND IF MARRIED CANNOT REMOVE THIS UP SPELLS FROM THE ACCOUNT WITHOUT THE SPOUSE PRESENT. SAME IS TRUE WITH MOST CREDIT CARDS. REPORTER CREDIT AND LOW CREDIT SCORE THE CREDIT SCORE SCALE RUNS FROM. THREE HUNDRED TO EIGHT FIFTY WITH MOST CLIENTS I MEET WITH IN THE THREE HUNDRED FIVE SEVENTY NINE CATEGORY ALONG WITH 16% OF THE NATION. MAJORITY FOLKS IN THE COUNTRY HAVE BETWEEN SIX SEVENTY AND SEVEN NINETY NINE AND THAT NUMBER MAKES UP APPROXIMATELY THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY. I DEBT TO INCOME RATIOS THEY'RE OFTEN UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED. THEY HAVE ONE OR MORE ADDICTIONS. USE OF ACTIONS ARE OFTEN TIED TO THE ABUSER AND CREATE EXTREME DIFFICULTIES AND WE HOUSING EVEN WHEN APPLYING FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. JUDGMENTS ARE CHILD SUPPORT IN ARREARS. TAX LIENS OR TACK ISSUE THAT TAX ISSUES CAUSED BY MISS FILINGS NON FILINGS OR TAX FRAUD. STUDENT LOANS IN DEFAULT. WE SEE MULTIPLE STUDENT LOANS AND FALL AND MOST OFTEN THEY'RE FORCED TO DROP OUT BY THE ABUSER OR DUE TO LACK OF CHILDCARE OR TRANSPORTATION. ONE OR MORE VEHICLES HAVE BEEN TOTALED IMPOUNDED -- REPOSSESSED. IT'S A COMMON TACTIC OF ABUSER TO DESTROY THE VICTIM'S CARS THEY CAN'T LEAVE AND IT'S FAIRLY WELL KNOWN THAT A CAR IS SEEN BY A VICTIM. AS ITS INITIAL WAY OUT ESPECIALLY WHEN CHILDREN ARE INVOLVED. IF THE SURVIVOR HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF TRAFFICKING WE ALSO SEE MANY AUTO LEASES WITH EARLY TERMINATION IN OUTSTANDING BALANCES. AS THE ABUSERS HOPES CYCLES OF LEASING HIGH AND CARS IN THE VICTIM'S NAME AND TURNING THEM BACK IN AFTER TWO TO THREE MONTHS. LEGAL FEES FOR DIVORCE AND CHILD CUSTODY THIS CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SOME. TO SEVERAL CASES I'VE SEEN THAT IT ENDED UP COSTING CLOSER TO THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND SOME CASES GET DROPPED BY LEGAL AID AS THE CASE BECOMES TOO COMPLEX MOST OFTEN AT THE WELL IN CRAFT OF THE ABUSER. THEY HAVE A SPOUSE THAT DOESN'T WORK OR HIDES INCOME THEREFORE REDUCING ANY SUPPORT LEAVING THE VICTIM PALACE PENNILESS UPON SETTLEMENT. AND MOST OF THE CLIENTS. OUR EMBATTLED IN CUSTODY CASES MANY OF WHICH INVOLVE CPS. ALMOST ALL SUFFER SOME DEGREE OF PTSD TYPE SYMPTOMS. WHICH CREATE HUGE CHALLENGES ONE TRYING TO FOCUS ON ALL DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF RECREATING THEIR LIVES. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIVES. WHICH MOST OF THEM HAVE LITTLE TO NO EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING. MOST OFTEN WHEN I MEET WITH THE CLIENTS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE SEEN THEIR ENTIRE FINANCIAL PICTURE IN CREDIT REPORT. THEY MAY ASSUME THEIR CREDIT REPORT IS DAMAGED. THEY MAY KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF AN APARTMENT. BUT THEY MAY NOT KNOW THAT THEY OWE THREE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PASS LANDLORDS. THEY KNOW THEY'RE LEFT WITH ONLY THE MONEY THEIR POCKET IF ANY. AND THE MAJORITY THINK BANKRUPTCY IS THE ONLY WAY OUT BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS IT BANKRUPTCIES COST MONEY. AND HAVE TO QUALIFY WHICH TAKES OFF THE TABLE FOR MANY OF THEM. UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN TIPPED OFF BY MAIL OR PHONE CALL FROM THE IRS TO CREDITORS THIS IS VERY TYPICALLY THE FIRST TIME THE VICTIM IS ALLERGIC TO THE EXTENT OF THE FINANCIAL ABUSE. IT'S A VERY EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE FROM US VICTIMS AS MONEY RUNS THROUGH EVERYTHING IN OUR LIVES YOU CAN GIVEN A COUNT OF WHO YOU ARE AND WHATYOU'VE BEEN THROUGH BY LOOKING AT YOUR CREDIT REPORT AND BANK STATEMENTS. IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THEM. IN THE MOST SEVERE CASES CLIENTS FIND THE ON PROPERTIES THEY DIDN'T KNOW INTEL THEY'VE NEVER PHYSICALLY VISITED. THEIR CREDIT CARDS IN THEIR NAMES OF BALANCES THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD THEY HAVE ADDICTIONS COLLECTIONS FOR EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE. AND THE MOST HURTFUL OF THOSE COLLECTIONS ARE FOR COSIGNED BAIL WHERE THEY WERE FORCED TO BAIL OUT THEIR VERY OWN ABUSER. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR THE AVERAGE KIND OF MET WITH ISRAEL HOUSING. IN AN ALREADY TIGHT HOUSING MARKET A PERSON WITH CREDIT ISSUE HAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TIME FINDING A LANDLORD THAT WILL GIVE THEM A CHANCE WITH LOW CREDIT SCORES AND POOR RENTAL RATINGS. AND WHEN THEY FIND THAT RARE COMBINATION OF AFFORDABILITY AND SECOND CHANCE CREDIT. THE HOUSING ISN'T USUALLY CLOSED TO TRANSPORTATION IN GOOD SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEAR GOOD PAYING JOBS OR NEAR AMPLE CHILDCARE OPTIONS. I HAVE A KIND OF IN WORKING WITH FOR MONTHS WHO HAS COLLECTIONS AND EVICTIONS DUE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FINANCIAL ABUSE. SHE WAS TURNED DOWN BY ONE LAND ART AFTER THE OTHER FOR POOR CREDIT PARENTAL HISTORY AND COLLECTIONS TOTALING MORE THAN THE RENT. SHE WOULD WALK FROM SHELTER EACH DATA PUBLIC TRANSIT. TRANSIT WITH THREE KIDS DROPPED THEM OFF AT SCHOOL GO BACK TO TRANSIT TO APPLY FOR EMPLOYMENT. GET BACK ON TRANSIT OR WALK TO HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE TO OBTAIN SERVICES OR GET TO THE FOOD BANK FOR GROCERIES. GET BACK TO PICK UP CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL IT BACK TO SHELTER VIA MULTIPLE BUSES. WITH THREE CHILDREN IN TOW ALL THEIR BELONGINGS PLUS GROCERIES AND IMMEDIATELY UPON RETURN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A DOZEN CALLS ON HOUSING WAITING LIST TO SEE IF ANY OPENINGS CAME UP BEFORE THE OFFICES CLOSE. WHAT WE FOUND IS MOST PLACES HAVE WAITING LISTS NOW AND THE REPORT THEY DON'T EVEN BOTHER CALLING IN ON ON THE LIST? BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THEY'RE STILL LOOKING FOR HOUSING. I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THIS CLIENT WAS ABLE TO FIND A GOOD JOB IN ON JUNE FIRST WE WAS ABLE TO ASSIST US CLIENT WITH THEIR DEPOSIT AND SHE WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN HOUSING. WITH SIGNED LEASE IN HAND SHE CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND SOBBED FOR OVER AN HOUR. SHE WAS HAPPY SCARED RELIEVED AND ANXIOUS ABOUT OUR FUTURE FUTURE BUT MOSTLY SHE WAS FLAT OUT EXHAUSTED. THAT WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP NOW SHE BEGINS A LONG CLIMB UP THE MOUNTAIN OF DEBT FINANCIALLY RECOVER FOR HERSELF AND HER THREE CHILDREN. ON THE OTHER SPECTRUM IS A CLIENT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SINCE LAST OCTOBER WHO RIDER FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT CLASS WITH A BAG FULL OF MAIL SHE JUST STARTED RECEIVING IT HAD NO IDEA WHAT ANY OF IT WAS. THIS CLIENT IS A HIGHLY EDUCATED PERSON WITH AN EXCELLENT CLICK CAREER. SHE HAS BEEN EMPLOYED FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AS A HIGH END EDUCATOR. AS IT TURNED OUT THE BAG WAS FULL OF MAIL LETTERS FROM CREDITORS IN THE IRS. WHAT WE FOUND WAS OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT HER NAME ON MULTIPLE CREDIT CARDS FOR WHICH DID NOT APPLY? A BUSINESS THAT WAS CREATED IN OUR NAME. WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE BUT DEBT ACCRUED UNDER COMPANY CREDIT CARDS. IRIS INFORMATION WITH THAT RICH REVEALED TAX REFUND SHE EARNED BUT NEVER SAW FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. INSURANCE INSURANCE FUNDS THAT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED AND DISPERSED BY HER ABUSER. THERE ARE NO LAWS TO PROTECT HER. THE POLICE TOOK REPORT BUT DON'T HAVE THE MANPOWER TO LAUNCH SUCH COMPLEX FINANCIAL INVESTIGATION. THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WON'T TAKE AN IDENTITY THEFT CLAIM OVER THE PHONE. AS THE PERSON WHO SOLD HER IDENTITY AS HER SPOUSE AND THEY DON'T CONSIDER THAT A QUALIFYING EVENT. SEVERAL ATTORNEYS INCLUDING THE DA'S OFFICE HAVE REVIEWED THE CASE GOING TO TURN THE CLIENT AWAY DUE TO LACK OF CRIMINAL CHARGES. THAT CAN APPLY TO THE CASE. BANKRUPTCY WILL MOST LIKELY BE OUR ONLY COURSE OF ACTION THIS POINT. WHAT SHE CAN GET HER DIVORCE FINALIZED IF YOU CAN? AND THAT WILL HAVE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON HER FOR YEARS SHE WILL STRUGGLE TO FIND A RENTAL SHE WILL BE KEPT FROM BUYING A HOME. AND WHAT SHE IS ELIGIBLE SHE WILL PAY A HIGHER INTEREST RATE. SHE WILL PAY HIGHER INTEREST RATE SHE GOES TO BUY A CAR. AND SHE WILL LOSE ALL OF HER GOOD CREDIT THE CREDIT SHE ACTUALLY APPLIED FOR AND MAINTAINED PERFECTLY. IN ORDER TO GET RID OF ALL THE BAD DEBT HER ABUSER TOOK OUT HER NAME. THIS CLIENT WILL HAVE TO START OVER FINANCIALLY AT A TIME IN HER LIFE WHEN SHE SHOULD BE MAKING PLANS FOR RETIREMENT. SHE WILL BE FORCED TO REINVENT HERSELF AND HER FINANCIALS. BEFORE I WALKED IN HERE TODAY AYE LETTER NO I'VE SPEAKING HERE. BOB AND I RECEIVED A TEXT FROM HER. WHERE SHE OUTLINED HER THIRD VISIT TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TODAY IN HOPES OF GETTING A WARRANT? THAT SHE COULD USE WITH THE DA. SHE WAS TOLD THAT ALTHOUGH. HIS ACTIVITY WAS CRIMINAL IT WAS NOT ILLEGAL. SHE GOES ON TO STATE THAT IF IT WERE NOT FOR HER DAUGHTER. SHE IS AT THE POINT WHERE SHE WOULD TAKE HER LIFE. BECAUSE SHE IS SO TIRED OF THE MANIPULATION THE ABUSE. AND SHE'S JUST FLAT OUT DONE. SO I'VE HEARD YOU ASK HOW WE CAN HELP. ON HERE'S FEW IDEAS WELL JUST JUMP RIGHT TO IT -- WE NEED LAWS TO PROTECT VICTIMS OF FINANCIAL ABUSE -- FINANCIAL ABUSES MENTIONED INVOLVED BUT IT'S NOT COVERED. TRANSPORTATION NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WE NEED TO BE A LOT MORE TRANSPORTATION ANSWERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE HAULING CHILDREN AROUND. CHILDCARE AND MORE RAPID PAYMENT OF PROVIDERS SO MORE PROVIDERS WILL COME ONLINE. THEY NEED CHILDCARE. WHILE THEY APPLY FOR WORK THEY NEED PROGRAMS THAT WILL TRANSPORT KIDS FROM SCHOOL TO AFTER SCHOOL CARE. THEY NEED SUMMER CARE FOR KIDS THAT COVER WORK HOURS. WHEN YOU LANDLORDS ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH CHALLENGE CREDIT? WE NEED MORE ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE PROVIDING INFORMATION OF FINANCIAL ABUSE AND ACCESS TO CREDIT REPORTS AND CREDIT COUNSELORS. MANY MORE LEGAL AID FOR DIVORCE AND CUSTODY CASE WITH SLIDING PAY SCALES. WE NEED TO CREATE MORE LONG TERM HOUSING SHELTERS SO TO TWELVE MONTHS I WOULD SAY. FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FINANCIAL ABUSE THAT THEY HAVE THE TIME TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT KEPT THEM FROM FINDING LONG TERM HOUSING CHILDCARE TRANSPORTATION AND EMPLOYMENT. WE NEED TO CREATE MORE AVENUES TO ADDRESS UNLAWFUL DETAINER. TO HELP PEOPLE AND CLEARING THEM OFF THE RECORDS. OR REDUCTIONS IN SETTLEMENTS WERE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR FINANCIAL ABUSE CAN BE SHOWN TO BE THE CAUSE OF ACTION TO INCREASE SURVIVORS ABILITY TO RE HOUSE THEMSELVES. AND WE NEED TO EDUCATE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL REGARDING CREDIT BUDGETING FINANCIAL SAFETY. ESPECIALLY AROUND TODAY'S TECHNOLOGIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC THANK YOU. ARMY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I THINK WE GOT ALL YOUR POINTS DOWN BUT YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT THAT YOU'RE READING FROM YOU CAN PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE JUST SO WE CAN GET. AND HAVE EVERYTHING ACCURATELY OF DOWN YOU KNOW I I I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS A WAY -- TO FURTHER VICTIMIZE -- ONE WHO HAS BEEN ABUSED I'M I'M THINKING OF A GENTLEMAN WHO'S AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WOES WHOSE PARTNER. DID EVERYTHING HE COULD LITERALLY BY CONVINCING THE BANK THAT THEY WERE THAT HE HAD. ACCESS SO THEY WERE JOINT CUSTODY ON ACCOUNT CLOSE THEY COUNT MOVED ALL THE MONEY OUT -- AND THEN PUT HIS NAME ON THE LEASE -- WHICH WAS NOT LEGAL PUT HIS NAME ON THE LEASE AND THAT WAS A WAY TO CONTINUE TO FURTHER. ABUSE -- OF THAT INDIVIDUAL AND ALSO THAT THAT THE MENTAL -- ABUSE AND THE MOST ABUSED AT THAT PLAYED -- AS A ROLL OF THIS INDIVIDUAL AND SO I'VE TRIED SEIZE GIVES ME NOTES I POSSIBLY CAN IN TERMS OF SOME YEARS SUGGESTS I APPRECIATE. UNDER PRESENTATION OF MISTER COOLEY. HOMELESS FOUR I DID WANT TO JUST THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT ABOUT NEEDING MORE TIME AND HOUSING. SELECT TO JUST GIVE THEM PLACE. SAFETY FORCING TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES I THINK. THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF FINANCIAL ABUSE IT MAY NOT EVEN COME TO THEIR ATTENTION. UNTIL IT COMES OUR ATTENTION IN A BIG WAY [inaudible] THE IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT PEOPLE NEED A PLACE FROM WHICH THEY CAN TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE [inaudible] ISSUES AND TIME. IS AN ELEMENT IN THAT SOLUTION AS WELL AS THE OTHER. TYPES OF HER CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS YOU HAVE BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR KIND OF PUT THE SPOTLIGHT. ON EVERYTHING BUT THAT REALLY JUMPED OUT AT ME IS VERY PRACTICAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I NEXT AND FINAL PRESENTER. THANK YOU I'M A SURCHARGE ESCOBAR'S LOW AT THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I WANT TO THANK A CHAIRPERSON RUBIO FORD AT CONVENING. THE COMMITTEE AND FOR EACH OF YOU THAT WHO HAVE ATTENDED. AND PARTICIPATED. I'M I AM AN EXPERT ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND NOT ONLY BECAUSE I WORK ON THE POLICY SOME OF THOSE THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY THAT BECAUSE I'VE EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC. ABUSING MY HOME I'M GROWING UP AS A CHILD. MY FATHER A SUFFERED GREATLY WITH MENTAL HEALTH A DISORDER OF POST STRESS DISORDER THAT HE OBTAINED WHILE HE WAS A SOLDIER IN VIETNAM. AND HE DIDN'T RECEIVE AT ANY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE TIME. THESE WEREN'T WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR VICTIMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER FAMILIES -- WERE TOLD THAT IT DIDN'T EXIST AND AND HE WAS SPIT ON BY PEOPLE IN HIS COMMUNITY AND AND MY BROTHER FAMILY -- SO HE AND HE SUFFERED GREATLY FROM THAT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW IF HE WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN ABUSIVE HAD YOU NOT HAD PTSD BECAUSE I NEVER KNEW HIM WITHOUT PTSD. DID ABUSE THAT WE HAD IN OUR FAMILY -- IT WAS VERY CYCLICAL EVERY WEEKEND THERE WAS SELF MEDICATION ABUSE AND VIOLENCE GUN VIOLENCE -- PHYSICAL VIOLENCE MONETARY ABUSE UPON [inaudible] AND CONTROL. AND FOR US AS CHILDREN WHAT IT MEANT IS THAT WE HAD A LOT ON THE WEEKENDS WE HEAD IN THE BATHTUB WHEN THE GUN WAS OUT. WE HAD A VERY BADLY HIDDEN R. TOY BOXES -- AND ONCE AFTER MY MOTHER WENT TO THE HOSPITAL -- FOUND FROM A BRADLEY -- HORRIBLE WEEKEND WE WE ESCAPED. I WE WENT AWAY FOR A WHOLE A WEEK. ON MY SYSTEM MYSELF AND MY MOM. CAN WE LIVE IN THIS TOWN IN LODI WE WENT TO A MOBILE HOME PARK IN LODI. AND I REMEMBER IT REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE IT WAS A WEEK OF OF JOY ELATION [inaudible] PLAY FUN ON AND A WE DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT THINGS. IT WAS SUMMER WE HAD WATER BALLOON FIGHTS AT THE OTHER KIDS AND THE WAS A GOAT WHO LIVED IN A MOBILE HOME PARK AND HE WOULD COME INTO OUR HOME. AND LIKE CASES AROUND THE HOME IN THE MOBILE HOME. IT WAS A REALLY GREAT MEMORY. A LOSS OF I REMEMBER NOT BEING AFRAID. WHEN THE WEEK WAS OVER WE WENT BACK? AND MY SISTER AND I STOOD SAT IN THAT. IN THE END. IN THE STATION WAGON. AND WE WOULDN'T LEAVE. AND IT GOT DARK AND WILL CRY AND FINALLY MY DAD CAME OUT. AND PULL THE SAID. AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON I MEAN WE NEVER REALLY HAD A CLOSE TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FATHER OBVIOUSLY. ON BUT WE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY MOTHER. BECAUSE WE WERE ANGRY AT HER FOR BRINGING US BACK. I WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WOULD DO THAT. MY SISTER ESPECIALLY. AND FROM THERE THINGS DIDN'T GET BETTER. EVERY TIME THAT MY MOTHER WOULD COME TO THE POINT OF WANTING TO LEAVE MY FATHER WOULD SAY REMEMBER WHEN YOU LEFT. AND YOU CAME BACK. BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN. WHEN I GOT OLDER I ASKED MY MOM WHY DID YOU GO BACK? BECAUSE WE ASKED ALL THE TIME TO LEAD. AND SHE SAID WE HAD NO MONEY. WE RAN OUT OF MONEY. MY FATHER CONTINUED TO TOOK CONTROL IN OUR LIVES ECONOMICALLY AS WELL. AND THE WAY HE DID THAT WAS HE PREVENTED MY MOTHER FROM GETTING CHILD CARE. SHE WASN'T ABLE TO GET CHILD CARE. THAN HER GOING TO TO WORK ON WHERE SHE WORKED AT CHEVRON. IN THE MAIL ROOM. WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH TO PAY. FOR THE COST OF CHILDCARE SO HE REFUSED THE TO PROVIDE ANY PORTION OF THE AMOUNT OF CHILD CARE. AND SHE COULDN'T AFFORD TO KEEP US IN CHILD CARE. I'M EACH TIME SHE WOULD TRY TO GET A JOB IN ENOUGH MONEY TO ESCAPE [inaudible] ON YOU NOTE SHE'D HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ALSO KEEP US IN CHILD CARE. I WOULDN'T WHEN SCHOOL WASN'T THERE [inaudible] ON AND AS A RESULT WE FOR THE MOST PART DIDN'T HAVE CHILD CARE. WE WERE IN THE LEFT AT PEOPLE'S HOUSES. OR WE WERE AND AND LOCKED DOWN IN OUR OWN HOUSE. AND ADMIT WE HAD INJURIES THAT WE DIDN'T REPORT. AND BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID THAT IT WOULD COST MONEY TO GO THE DOCTORS [inaudible] ON WE FOUND WE WERE HURT AND AND AT ABUSED BY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF US. I'M AND THESE ALL HAPPENED BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE CHILD CARE MY MOM MOM TRIED. TO HER HER WAY OUT OF THIS. SO AND THE THINGS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY WITH THE TESTIMONY AND PEOPLE HELPING AND PEOPLE AND I'M SUPPORTING. THOSE A SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE TO ESCAPE POVERTY -- ARE ALL THINGS THAT FOR ME PERSONALLY RING TRUE. PROFESSIONALLY I SERVICE THE SERVICE CENTER FOR THAT CAL FRESH AND CAL WORKS SUPPORT CENTER FOR LEGAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO THEY ALSO RING TRUE PROFESSIONAL. A LOT OF THE THINGS WE THINK WE HEAR FROM STORIES COMING THROUGH TWO TO LEGAL SERVICES AND AND WHAT I WANNA SAY ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE KNOW FROM THOSE STORIES. THAT POLICY WORKS TO INTERCEPT DOMESTIC ABUSE M. AT AT THE INTERSECTION OF POVERTY. I'M AND I'M GONNA YOU HEARD SOME SOME OF THOSE MENTIONED TODAY HER DEPUTY DIRECTOR BLAND TALK ABOUT THAT CAO WORKS PROGRAM AND SOME OF THE CHANGES WE'VE RECENTLY MADE AN ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE AT SEVEN BUT THE AUTHORED BY YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER UBIO. AND AT THIS IS NOT THESE PIECES OF FIVE I SEVEN ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE BY SEVEN ARE NOT YET IN PLACE UP BUT THEY WILL BE SOON AND WE EXPECT THEM TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. I YOU ALSO HEARD ABOUT COW FRESHEN HOW WE NOW ALLOW FAMILIES TO APPLY AS A SEPARATE HOUSEHOLD FOR CAO FRESH. AND UP TO APPLY FOR A DIFFERENT EBT CARD ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER CARD -- SO THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR FOR REPLACEMENT BENEFITS ON THE SAME CARD THAT THE PERSON WHO ABUSED THEM HAS ACCESS. TO AND THIS IS A NEW POLICY AS WELL AND ONE THAT AYE WE ARE UNIQUELY DOING IN CALIFORNIA I THINK OTHER STATES CAN BENEFIT FROM. WE'VE ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THAT PUT THESE TWO TOGETHER BUT FOR US AT LEGAL SERVICES THEY WERE VERY MUCH CONNECTED WE REPEALED THE FAMILY CAP. THE MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT PROGRAM UP IN THE NEXT MONTH AND THE GRANT OF RULE IN OUR CAL ARTS PROGRAM WE HAD A A RULE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT DENIED AID TO A CHILD WHO WAS BORN. INTO A CAL WORKS HOUSEHOLD AND AN A COUNTLESS NUMBER OF OF PARENTS OF MOTHERS AT WORK WERE DENIED AID FOR CHILDREN THAT THEY CONCEIVED AS A RESULT OF ABUSE. A BUT WE WE DIDN'T HEAR A LOT ABOUT IT TODAY ON THE PANEL BUT REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IS ALSO A FORM OF ABUSE THAT MANY A WOMEN EXPERIENCE. AND WHERE THEY ARE DENIED A AS YOU NOTE SERVICES EITHER ABORTION SERVICES OR AND A PREGNANCY PREVENTION SERVICES. AND WE ALSO HAD A YOU KNOW SPOUSES THAT WERE RAPED BY THEIR SPOUSE OR RAPES BY AT AND A PERSON WHO LIVE WITH THEM. AND I IF THEY WERE RAPED THE CHILD IF THE IF THE CHILD WAS CONCEIVED AS RAPE IN THE PRIOR RULE THAT THAT FAMILY COULD GET AID FOR THE CHILD. BUT IF THEY WERE A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. THEY COULD NOT. AND SO THAT LINE WAS A WITH BILL IS NOT THAT IT WAS A VERY THIN LINE AND AND OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WOULD. NOT RECEIVE AID. A FOR A CHILD THAT THEY AT CONCEIVED THROUGH ABUSE. THAT RULE HAS BEEN REPEALED AND IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE. OTHER THINGS MAKING A DIFFERENCE THAT WE AT THE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED I'M EXCITED ABOUT A THE GRAND INCREASES I THINK WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE INCREASE IN THE DATA FROM SIXTY FIVE TO EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR THE TEMPORARY SHELTER IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE HOME VISITING THE JUST PETS HOPEFULLY WILL BE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE BUDGET -- SOON CREATING A NEW PROGRAM SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WHEN THEY HAVE WHEN THEY'RE PREGNANT AND AND HAVE A SMALL CHILD. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT AND DOMESTIC ABUSE IS OFTEN ONSET AT THE MOMENT OF PREGNANCY. IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE ENTRY PLACES FOR ABUSE AND SO THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO NOW HAVE SOCIAL WORKERS AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME PARENTS -- WHO ARE PREGNANT -- LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO ARE PREGNANT. THAT WILL AND WE HOPE THAT CAN BE A PLACE ANON RAMP FOR DOMESTIC ABUSE SERVICES AT A MOMENT WHERE WE SEE AN UPTICK AND DOMESTIC ABUSE. AND PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY BUT WE DO BECAUSE WE SEE CLIENTS SSI CASH OUT. AS I CASH SO A ENDING THE BAN FOR CALPERS FOR PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE CAP AT CAT SSI WILL HELP THEM SECURE AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY OR DISABLED. AND LIVE ALONE THEY'LL NOW BE ABLE TO GET AT CAL FRESH WHEN THEY HAVEN'T BEFORE MAKING THEM MORE AND INDEPENDENT AND MORE. LIKELY A TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE. ON A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE RELY ON SSI BECAUSE THEIR WAGES HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED THROUGHOUT THEIR EARNINGS THEIR YEARS OF EARNINGS AND SO VICTIMS OF THE DEMANDS OF OF ABUSE SURVIVORS OF ABUSE. AND OF HAVING LOWER EARNINGS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIME MORE LIKELY TO RELY ON SSI WHEN THEY GET OLDER SO THAT A THAT THE CHANGE IN POLICY PREDICT. FOR OLDER. VICTIMS OF ABUSE AND SURVIVORS OF ABUSE. WHAT CAN WE DO MOVING FORWARD? ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR AND I KNOW THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLY ON IN THE IN THE LEGISLATIVE YEAR WITH YOUR BILL LAST YEAR. IS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE EXEMPTIONS FROM WELFARE TO WORK. BEYOND JUST WHEN THE PERSON. IS UNABLE TO WORK DUE TO A DIRECT LINK TO THE DOMESTIC ABUSE. AND WHEN SOMEBODY APPLIES TO HAVE A WAIVER FROM THE WELFARE TO WORK RULE IN CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT SOMEHOW THERE DID THEIR ABUSE IS DIRECTLY LINKED. TO THEIR INABILITY TO WORK -- BUT SOMETIMES A CONNECTION IS NOT AS CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO STILL HAVE TO LIVE IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS AS A PERSON WHO HAS ABUSE THEM. AND LEAVING BACK AND FORTH TO WORK HAVING A* A AND A VERY VISIBLE PATTERN OF TRAVEL TRANSPORT FROM YOU KNOW IN PUBLIC TRANSIT FROM FROM THEIR HOME TO THEIR WORK PUTS THEM IN DANGER. ALSO IM WHEN YOU ARE SURVIVING DOMESTIC ABUSE. YOU ARE IN A A A PLACE MENTALLY WITH THE OR AND MENTAL HEALTH RECOVERY AND WITH YOUR SPIRITUAL RECOVERY SOMETIMES OF THE PHYSICAL RECOVERY WHERE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR INABILITY TO WORK. ON AND THE ABUSE IS SOMETIMES NOT AVAILABLE AND VISIBLE TO OTHERS SOMETIMES YOU'RE STILL. COTTON CONNECTING THE DOTS YOURSELF. ON AND SO BEING FORCED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN ORDER TO HAVE THE SPACE AS YOU SAY IF I REMEMBER COOLEY -- TO GET THROUGH THE ABUSE AND SURVIVED THE ABUSE AND I THINK IS REALLY UNFAIR. AND AN AND THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT IS THAT WE WE ALSO. WHEN SOMEBODY DOES FINALLY DISCLOSE A THAT MAYBE THEY THEY ARE IN A TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP NOW WITH THEIR WORKER AND THEY'RE DISCLOSING THE DOMESTIC ABUSE -- AT THE END AND THEY DISCLOSE THAT HAPPENED PRIOR [inaudible] AND THEY AND THEIR NOT ABLE TO GO BACK AND RECAPTURE THOSE THOSE YEARS AND MONTHS OF EMPLOYMENT TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND MAKE THE MOST OF THEM WE'VE ASKED FOR SOME ON TAKE THE ABILITY TO AND TAKE SOME OF THOSE. MONTHS AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN COMPLYING WITH THE WELFARE TO WORK REQUIREMENT BY DOING WORK FARE. ON BUT YOU'RE JUST GETTING BY YOU'RE TRYING TO SURVIVE AND BE AND SURVIVING IS NOT THE SAME AS DRIVING IT'S NOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF WORK. AND SO WE WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO RESET THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AND GO BACK SET RETROACTIVE AND TAKING AND AND AND THAT KIND OF LOOSER CONNECTION ON THE WELFARE TO WORK WAIVER FOR THAT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT CHILD CARE IT'S IN A CENTURY YOU MENTIONED -- BEING ABLE TO HAVE A CHILD CARE AFTER YOU LEAVE BUT BEFORE. YOU LEAVE YOU NEED TO IN ORDER TAKE TO EARN YOUR WAY OUT OF A SITUATION WHERE YOU WON'T BE HOMELESS. AND AND AND AND CRIMINALIZE BECAUSE OF YOUR HOMELESSNESS BY THE WAY -- CRIMINALIZE BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN THE CAR THAT YOU HAVE THANKFULLY AND THAT YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET. A BECAUSE OF THE COWARDS ASSET RULE [inaudible] ON IT IN ORDER TO SAVE THAT MONEY YOU NEED CHILDCARE IN ADVANCE SO JUST. FUNDING CHILD CARE ACROSS THE BOARD WE NEED TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT. INCREASING GRANTS AS WELL AND CAL WORKS OF CAO WORKS AND CAL FRESH COULD HELP FAMILIES GET TO A PLACE ABOVE THE POVERTY AND AND INTO -- AND THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE. ON FOOD HELP YOU KNOW A IT AS YOU HEARD SOME OF THE THE SURVIVORS OF ABUSE ARE -- THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND THEIR SPIRIT HAS BEEN CHALLENGED. NOT GOING HUNGRY AND ME OF SOME OF OUR ERA PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THIS HUNGER STRIKE FOR THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN ARE HERE RIGHT NOW BUT BEING HUNGRY. NOT ONLY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO FOCUS ON FINDING A JOB AND FINDING HOUSES AND TAKING CARE OF YOUR KIDS AND SURVIVING YOUR ABUSE. BUT IT ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT. TO BE EMOTIONALLY WELL. AND ON THAT NOTE THEY'LL SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE THE OF MORE PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE WHEN THEY'RE HUNGRY. I'M SO WE CAN JUST KEEP FOOD M. ON THE IT IN THE FRIDGE OF FOOD IN THEIR COOLERS AS THEY'RE LEAVING A THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL WE ON WE WE TALKED ABOUT YOU HEARD ABOUT WORKER RIGHTS AND WORKER RIGHTS BEING ESSENTIAL BEING ABLE TO EXPAND PAID SICK DAYS FROM THREE DAYS TO SEVEN DAYS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD MAKE A BIG IMPACT ON HELPING PEOPLE TO LEAVE -- AT DOMESTIC ABUSE. YOU HEARD ABOUT THE OVERPAYMENT SITUATION WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE OUR OVERPAYMENT ROLE LAW FOR CAL WORKS THIS IS NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE A DOMESTIC ABUSE SURVIVOR AND HAVE AN OVERPAYMENT THAT'S ADMINISTRATIVE. OVERPAYMENT WE COULD ACCOMMODATE THOSE OTHER SITUATIONS ARE NOT FORCE PEOPLE TO PAY UP BACK MONEY THAT THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG TO RECEIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES CAN BE COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO PARSE OUT THE WORKERS TO TRY TO PARSE OUT IS THIS YOUR ASSET OR YOUR ASSET -- THAT EXISTS A IT THE INCOME THAT YOU HAVE DOES BELONG TO YOUR EX HUSBAND OR IS IT YOURS -- AND SO HAT AT HOT HELPING THE THE WORKERS BE RELIEVED OF THE BURDEN THAT IF THEY DO AN OVERPAYMENT THIS PERSON WOULD HAVE TO PAY IT BACK I THINK WOULD BE. A VERY HELPFUL POLICY CHANGE. YOU HEARD ABOUT CONVICTIONS AT HOW YOU HEARD ABOUT AND SORRY AND THE VIXEN'S I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT CONVICTION EXPUNGEMENT. FOR THIS POPULATION TOO MANY OF THE THE A DOMESTIC ABUSE. A SURVIVORS THAT WE SEE ALSO HAVE A CONVICTION THEMSELVES WHEN THEY CALLED THE POLICE THE POLICE -- GIVE A CITATION TO A THE ABUSER AND THEY GIVE A CITATION TO THE PERSON WHO CALLED. AND IF THEY HIT BACK IF THEY PUSH THEM AWAY AND SO AND THEY END UP WITH. PERHAPS NOT A CONVICTION BUT AN ARREST AND ARREST STAYS ON THEIR RECORDS CAN KEEP THEM OUT OF OTHER HOUSING UP UNTIL RECENTLY IT'S BEEN ABLE TO GET WELL IN IT CAN STILL KEEP YOU FROM. A JOB OF THE BAND THE BOX IS HELPING A LOT WITH THAT AND TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING DISCOURAGED FROM APPLYING FOR WORK BECAUSE OF A CONVICTION BUT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF DOMESTIC ABUSE SURVIVORS WITH CONVICTED WITH -- ARRESTS AND A FEW WITH CONVICTIONS YOU HEARD ABOUT THE DOCUMENT AYE DEKE AT ASSISTANCE CONSUMER CLEAN UP I THINK WE HAVE GREAT MODELS FOR THE FOSTER CARE AND FORMER FOSTER CARE THAT WE CAN MIGRATE. TO A COW WORKS TO SUPPORT A DOMESTIC ABUSE AND AND THE BROADER POPULATION. M. AND THEN I'M YOU KNOW FINALLY I THINK THAT THERE. IS A LOT TO DO AND HERE IN LEGAL AID -- LEGAL AID IS STILL A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO TO GET HELP. AND WE ARE FACING A TAX AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS MANY THINGS ARE AND THIS THIS INSTITUTION HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF LEGAL SERVICES ESPECIALLY FOR MIGRANTS AMONG WEEK WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND TO THINK ABOUT OTHER WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN SUPPORT THESE KIND THE COLLABORATIVE'S IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WERE LEGAL SERVICES IS A BIG PART OF THAT AND AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE LEGAL SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE AND A VERY UP BROADWAY. I'M SO WITH THAT I WILL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE AND I'M REMAIN FOR NICK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OR COMMENTS. THEY WERE WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I JUST WANNA GO -- THE SAY THAT -- THANK YOU FOR ALL THE EXPERTISE ESPECIALLY AYE AYE IN THE ALSO LONG. SENDS HER REGARDS AND SAID I THAT CHRIS FORD IS -- BEEN AMAZING OF FOUR WE'VE THE THAT SHE SPENDS MANY MANY HOURS OF VOLUNTEERING AND I KNOW WHERE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU DO AS WELL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THESE HEARINGS ONE I THINK BUT COMMITTEE OUR MEMBERS FOR ALSO BEING HERE ALOT BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW I KEEP STRESSING RETURN WITH ME. THAT THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN A CONVERSATION CHANGES TO COME OUT OF THIS AND SO I THOUGHT LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME IDEAS ON ON THAT I KNOW YOU STATED BY BOB MORE POLICY CHANGES FOR FOR ME IN PARTICULAR AND I THINK SO FOR SOME OF OUR MEMBERS -- WILL FOR THE FOLLOWING LEGISLATIVE YEAR I AM I GOING TO WORK VERY HARD TO BE HERE FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AND SO SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THAT TURNED OUT TERM LIMITING JUST BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT IS GOING TO HELP US. REALLY MAKE SOME DIFFERENCES IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND I THINK THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF OF THOSE CHANGES SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN THANK EVERYONE -- UP FOR BEING HERE AND I WITHOUT IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL PLEASE I COME UP AND SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE DO OUR CHANGES THANK YOU.

IT LANDED US IN A LOT OF MULTIPLE HOMES WITH A LOTTA. MORE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SELF MEDICATION SEXUAL ABUSE NOT JUST. THROUGH THE FEMALES BUT SAMAD MALE SIBLINGS WHICH IS. A TABOO IN AMERICA. WHICH IS JUST NOW BECOMING A FED SEXUALITY AND MY HOUSEHOLD TO THUMP DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WAS IT SPOKEO. THAT MADE US EVEN MORE BONTA BROUGH NOT ONLY THAT WE OR CPS KEEPS WE WERE CPS CASE THEREFORE WE LAX SECURITY SO. EVEN IF SOMEONE WAS TO MODESTO BUT THE FACT TO LET THE MATTER WITH US. NOBODY'S THERE TO PROTECT YOU. SOLD TO THE E. BIDDING SPEAK GONE. DILLON BAND OPEN FILE THE SILLY JUVENILE COURT SYSTEM CPS. JUST MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR YOU TO WALK AND SEWER. BE HIV OFFICE IN A MEAT THAT YOU NEED HELP TO TO YOU BECOMING AT OPEN FALLIBLE PLUG. SO THIS IS WHY ADVOCACY IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO DOMESTIC VALLEY. YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ISSUES WITH KING UP. IN ASKING FOR HELP IS NOT THAT THEY DON'T WON'T HELP THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN HELP. ONCE I BECAME A CERTAIN AGE IN. THE DOMESTIC. BECAME. BETWEEN THE COURT SYSTEMS ALL OF MY SIBLINGS OR RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME NOW THEY'RE SEXUALLY ACTIVE YOU UNDERSTAND THERE IT IS IT'S A MONEY PROBLEM -- WE FOUND OUT GRANDMA'S GET A CHECK PLUS. SHE'S WORKING AS LIKE A SLAVE TO MAKE THE AINSLEY FOR CPS SOARED NONSENSE MAKE ENDS MEET. BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY OF IT SO I'M GOING TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE. SO MANY CHILDREN. AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME BECAUSE THEY PARENTS OR SUFFERING FINANCIALLY. AND SECULAR BICU SAT ON THE CHILDREN. IN THEIR GAMES SEXUALLY EXPLOITED WHEN THEY WENT AWAY FROM HOME. AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN YEARS OLD MY GRANDMA FORECLOSED ON HER PROPERTY. IT WAS A FAVORITISM SITUATION AND HOUSEHOLD MUSCLES THE WAS RECEIVING SSI SHE WAS RECEIVING MORE FUNDS. SHE HAD A VOICE TO TODAY'S. THESE ARE YOUR FOLLOWS THE THESE ARE BEING USED ON A BE ALSO YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR MONEY GOING. YOU ON THE OTHER HAND YOU ONLY SEE FULL STEPS [inaudible] SHUT UP [inaudible] ONCE AGAIN. ITS FINANCIAL ABUSE SO WITH THAT BEING SAID WHEN HE CAME TO FORECLOSE ON THE PROPERTY. ALL I GET IS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE ON FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. YOU BETTER MAKE IT LAST. THIS IS NO LONGER HOME ACT TODAY WE DISPEL ALL DIS DOUBLENEST.

WELL WAS IT A GREAT WITH THE OPTION OF ME GRADUATING A GREAT IN BECOMING THE A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT [inaudible] AND BEEN A PART OF THE SEX TRADE IN THIS. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN I JUST LOST MY VIRGINITY.

I KNOW FOR WHOM MY HE ON THE BUS STOPS OLD LOW I'VE BEEN HER YEAR ON THE SAFE HOUSE THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE SAFE HOUSE IN ACTUALLY. NOT BEING ABLE TO HOLD HIS THING WAS COMMUNICATING DUE TO BE HIV FROM THE SAFE HOUSE PO BOX YOU KNOW HOW HORRIBLE IS GETTING MAIL OUT A MAILBOX THAT ANGEL MAILBOX YOU CAN'T JUST. WALK UP AND GET. TO MAIL OUT YOU LATE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU GOT A MANDATED REPORT BECAUSE IN THE PO BOX IN A CHECK EVERY TWO THREE DAYS. OR YOU TALK OF THE DO EMAIL BUT YOU IN A SAFE HOUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE INTERNET ACCESS IN A SAFE HOUSE [inaudible] IS LIMITED. SO IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE BUT IS STEEL [inaudible] OTHER THINGS [inaudible] FOR REQUIRE. I THINK FIRM BUT THANK YOU FOR FOR THAT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE'RE HAVING THE SCOOBIES CALL CONVERSATIONS AND I WOULD LOVE TO OFFER. ON MY COMMITTEE STAFF TO CONTACT YOU SO THAT YOU CAN. HELP US UNDERSTAND BECAUSE TO BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO ME THAT WHAT HAPPENS WITH WOMEN THAT COME FROM OTHER STATES AND AND WHEN YOU'RE FLEEING. OBVIOUSLY WANT TO GET AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE AND AND GETTING AWAY TO ANOTHER STATE IS AN OPTION BY. THE ALL THOSE BARRIERS THAT ARE PRESENTED WHEN YOU GET HERE AND SO I WOULD BE LOVE FOR MY COMMITTEE STAFF TO REALLY TALK TO YOU ABOUT. WHAT OTHER ISSUES THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THE FOLKS HERE BY? TAKING CARE OF SOMEBODY LIKE YOU THAT CAME IS ALSO SHOULD BE A PRIORITY BECAUSE AT THE END IF YOU'RE HERE WITH US. YOUR YOU BELONG TO US AND YOU'RE YOU'RE TAUGHT CHILDREN YOUR CHILD AND IT ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM HOPEFULLY AND SO WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO HELP -- SITUATIONS LIKE YOURS SOMEONE OF THANK YOU FOR REALLY -- SHARING THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THOSE -- IT EXAMPLES THOSE EXAMPLES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE OKAY IN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY SETTLING OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHTFUL HEARING AND FOR THE THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS OF COURSE SOME OF THE MEMBERS HAVE GONE BUT THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE ASKED TO THE WITNESSES TODAY WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT I THINK IT'S GIVEN. EVERYONE A LOT OF GROUNDING IN REALITY OF WHAT GOES ON FOR SO MANY WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN AND AND THAT'S BEEN REALLY APPRECIATED I KNOW IT'S VERY HARD. FOR THE WITNESSES TO TELL THOSE STORIES AND SO I WANT TO THANK THEM AS WELL FOR FOR SHARING. JUST A COUPLE THOUGHTS -- ARE THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE ENGAGE IN HOW DO WE TALK TO PEOPLE AND HOW WORKS AND HOW TO WE INSURER THAT WORD TAKE IT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEIR EXPERIENCES. AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND THEN WHAT CAN THEY ACCOMPLISHED REALISTICALLY I THINK ON ONE OF THE EXCITING THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IS WHAT WE CALL. THAT CAO WORK STRATEGIC INITIATIVE WORK HOURS TO PLANO WE TALK WITH YOUR STAFF ABOUT IT AND IT'S REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE ENGAGE WITH RECIPIENTS NOT JUST RECIPIENTS WERE SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. BUT I THINK THAT HAS IT HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS RATHER THAN JUST FILLING OUT A FORM AND SAYING HERE BE HERE ON THURSDAY OR YOU'RE GONNA GET THANKS AND IT'S A CONVERSATION. THAT WE CAN HAVE TO TALK WITH THEM ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE AND NOT JUST THEM BUT THEIR CHILDREN TO AND THE REST OF THEIR FAMILY SO AGAIN. GETTING AT THAT SORT OF MULTIPLE GENERATIONAL IF YOUR KID IS TRUANT. AND YOU GOTTA GO DOWN TO DEAL WITH THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT TO WORK IF YOU'RE HOMELESS DELIVERY YOUR CAR WE CAN SEND YOU THE JOB CLUB THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY FIRST. AND REALLY THINKING ABOUT THAT FIGHT OR FLIGHT AREN'T WE TRYING TO REALLY DRAW ON UNDERSTANDING THAT AND HOPING. TO TOWARD THAT SELF SEE AND A REALLY REALISTIC WAY AND UNDERSTANDING THAT SOMETIMES IT'S JUST WHAT'S THAT NEXT STEP YOU CAN TAKE WHAT IS LOVE WE CAUGHT THE ADJACENT POSSIBLE WHAT'S THAT POSSIBLE NEXT THAT. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIRTY HOURS A WEEK IT COULD BE A SMALL STEP AND THAT'S A POSITIVE AS WELL. AREN'T SO THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT I WANTED TO SHARE. ALSO TO DOCTOR ARAMBULA QUESTION ABOUT EASES FROM EARLIER ON HIS AB THREE FORTY FROM LAST YEAR DOES REQUIRE A MAN AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU HEARD IN THE COMMITTEE IN A TICKET SIGN. DIE EPS CT SCREENINGS AND MEDICARE HOT OF COURSE ALL CHILDREN ON CAL WORKS SERVE MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT FOSTER KIDS THIS IS ABOUT ALL KIDS. THE SCREENING TOOLS ARE BEING REVISED TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT TRAUMA AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND THAT PROCESS IS UNDER WAY WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES ON THE GROUP OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON THE GROUP AS REPORTED THAT IT'S GOING VERY WELL. THERE'S DOCTORS THERE'S PRACTITIONERS AND THEIR OVER THE MOON TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION SO WE THINK THAT DOES HOLD A LOT OF PROMISE. AND THEN THINKING THOUGH HOW DO WE CONNECT THAT TO CAL WORKS HOW DO WE INCLUDE THAT IN THE CONVERSATIONS SEEMS REALLY CRITICAL AND WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT STEP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THAT LEGISLATION. AND NOT JUST THE CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS WE'VE BEEN KIND OF THINKING ABOUT IT BUT IN A BROADER WAY AND THEN FINALLY JUST A COMMENT ABOUT THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS WHICH IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION I THINK FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON WHAT'S THE ONE THING. ON THAT YOU WOULD DO I THINK THAT YOLO COUNTY REPRESENTATIVE I MENTIONED HOUSING IN AND OUT DIRECTOR BLAND I'M FROM DSS TIME THEN. I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT AND PARTICULARLY TO EVICTION I THINK IT CAME UP AS A THEME ON A FEW OF THE PANELS TODAY. THE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT ADDICTION IN RECENT YEARS ESPECIALLY FOR THE WORK OF MATTHEW DESMOND ON WHO WROTE THE BOOK CALLED EVICTED AND RUNS THE VIXEN LAB IS THAT. ARE SURPRISINGLY A VIXEN ACTUALLY IS ARM. A PRECURSOR TO LOSING YOUR JOB LOSING YOUR JOB DOESN'T HAPPEN GENERALLY AND THEN YOU GET EVICTED YOU GET ADDICTED AND THEN YOU HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE. AND THEN YOU LOSE YOUR JOB IT CUT IT SPIRALS DOWN AND THOSE ADDICTIONS CAN BE LIFE CHANGING FOR PEOPLE THEY STAY ON A RECORD THAT MAKE IT HARDER TO GET AN AFFORDABLE PLACE. THAT ACTUALLY HAS RUNNING WATER IN THE SIX THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S JUST THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE VIXEN AND DOMESTIC ABUSE. WELL ON SOME OF THE STORIES THAT HE TALKS ABOUT HE LIVED IN MILWAUKEE FOR A YEAR TO AND AND RESEARCH THAT'S BUT I'M SURE IT'S APPLICABLE HERE. IS LANDLORDS DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU CALL THE COPS SO IF YOU HAVE A VIOLENCE GOING ON IN YOUR HOMEOWNER CALLING THE COPS FOR PROTECTION THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO PICK YOU. AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PROTECTION AGAINST THAT THE TO THINK ABOUT POLICIES THAT ARE A LITTLE OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM THAT I WORK IN AT C. WTA IT AND DIRECT HUMAN SERVICES. THINKING ABOUT KENYA VIC SOMEBODY THAT QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO SEEK PROTECTION FROM THE POLICE FOR A DOMESTIC INCIDENT ON JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT BECAUSE THE VICTIM CAN TOUCH OFF ALL OF THESE OTHER PROBLEMS. AND REALLY BECAUSE THE SPIRAL AND THEN THAT TOXIC STUFF THE POVERTY THAT WE KNOW WHEN CHILDREN GROW UP AND IT'S JUST SO TERRIBLE FOR THEM. ANYWAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI MY NAME IS DONNA BROWN AND I'M FROM A COMMUNITY FOR PEACE SOME AYE ONE OF THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTORS AND I USED TO BE ONE OF THE SAFE HOUSE MANAGERS BUT I'M ALSO A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OF TWENTY YEARS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WITH SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT ALL THESE ISSUES BUT IF A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS PTSD. ANXIETY DISORDERS AND SO ON AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THAT STEM FROM THE TRAUMA OF THEIR VIOLENCE. I MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE SYSTEMS ON THEIR OWN BUT ALSO MAKES THEM IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FILL OUT FORMS AND DO BASIC THINGS LIKE ON AN APPLICATION FOR RENTAL PROPERTY. OR IF THEY'RE BEING ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS THEY MAY GET OVERWHELMED BY AND FLEE FROM IT AND NEVER RETURN MAYBE NEVER TIMELY THINGS IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ARE WE ARE WE ADDRESSING YOU KNOW HOW FOLKS ARE RECEIVING SERVICES SO I HAVE SOME CLIENTS THAT I'VE DEALT WITH THAT THEY GO TO KAISER. AND THEY SAY BECAUSE OUR HOUSE A REALLY GOOD -- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THEY ASKED ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEIR ROLE THOROUGH ABOUT ASKING THESE QUESTIONS BUT THEN THEY CAN ONLY GO TO THERAPY FOR SO LONG. AND THEN THERE THAT GO FROM THAT THEY'RE BEING IN THEIR SHOT BACK OVER HERE AND THEN THERE SHOT OVER HERE TO GO GET SERVICES OVER HERE AND THEN THERE SHOT OVER HERE. FOR SOMEBODY WITH PTSD BECAUSE I KNOW I SUFFER FROM COMPLEX PTSD AND I KNOW WHEN I WAS IN THE HEIGHT NO BED AT ONE POINT IN MY LIFE. DOING A TO BE WAS LIKE DOING A TO Z.. AND SO I WILL PROBABLY DO A AND YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME ABBY. IWALKED AWAY FROM DE AJ SERVICES AND ME AND MY KIDS JUST SUFFER THROUGH IT AND I GOT MY NEED THE BEST WAY I KNEW HOW. BECAUSE OF MY PTSD WILL ALLOW ME TO GO SIT IN OFFICE FOR HOURS AND HOURS ON END ARE ALL DAY GOING FROM WINDOW TO WINDOW. BEING TALKED DOWN TO BENT TALK AT BEEN ASKED DEMEANING QUESTIONS. THAT SOUNDED LIKE MIGHT BE USER. SO YOU KNOW INSIDE OF THE SYSTEMS YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT. REALLY EVEN ANXIETY. FOUR PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING SERVICES AND EVEN WORKING IN THE SHELTER WHEN I WOULD HELP WOMEN WHO WOULD COME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES OR OTHER STATES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THEM THROUGH STAFF. BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT AGAIN BEGAN IN THAN THEY'VE THEY'LL GO AND DON'T TRY TO DO IT NOW COME BACK AND I'LL SAY A WHILE. MISS GHANA. I GOT THE DOOR SLAMMED IN MY FACE THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE BUT I KNOW AS A ADVOCATE BECAUSE I'VE DONE MY RESEARCH YET THAT IS AVAILABLE TO YOU AND THAT IN THAT IS YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE THAT AS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR SO ALSO TRAINING. MAKING SURE THAT SYSTEMS AND FOLKS WHO ARE PROBABLY PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE SERVICE ARE ALSO GIVING A TRUTHFUL INFORMATION TO THE CLIENTS. IS IT IN WRITING SO THEY CAN READ IT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I TELL YOU BECAUSE WITH PTSD YOU WON'T REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE A TV AYE YOU WON'T REMEMBER IT SO AS I WALK OUT THE DOOR I'LL FORGET HAVE WHAT YOU SAID. SO THAT'S YOU KNOW. MY QUESTION TODAY IS HOW ARE YA GONNA ADDRESS. PUTTING TOGETHER A SYSTEM BACK ALSO CREATES STABILITY FOR FOLKS. THERE IS NO STABILITY ITEM ONE THE YOUNG LADIES AND I WAS A LITTLE MOVE EMOTIONALLY MOVED BY IT BECAUSE SHE IS RIGHT. IF THEY MAKE ONE DOLLAR OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY THEIR CUT OFF ON THIS AND SO IT PROMISE OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND I LEAVE MY HOME AND I GO GET ON ASSISTANCE AND I GET FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS IF I GO GET A JOB THAT FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. I MADE A HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER A LITTLE OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT THEIR STILL DON'T QUALIFY FOR ANYTHING. FOR WOMEN WHO ARE MARRIED. OR YOU VICTIMS WHO ARE MARRIED. THE MISUSE OF THEIR AND FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION THERE ARE NO LAWS OUT THERE THAT PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN RELATION OR IN RELATIONSHIPS. THAT ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SO THEY'RE STUCK THEY'RE STUCK WATCHING THEIR WHOLE LIFE BE RIPPED DOWN [inaudible] THEIR NAME [inaudible] THEIR CREDIT. THERE FINANCES THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS INSIDE A DOMESTIC BONDS THAT. NEAR NO NOBODY'S LOOKING AT ARE THEY BEING PROSECUTED FOR THE CRYING. JUST IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS WE'VE I'VE SEEN. PROBABLY ABOUT TEN CASES. WHERE THE PERSON WAS? ONLY CHARGED WITH A VIOLATION OF THE RESTRAINING ORDER BUT NOT PROSECUTED FOR THE ACTUAL CRIME ONE OF MY LATEST THE ABUSER AMBUSHED HER THE DAY AFTER SHEEP WE WILL START WITH THE RESTRAINING ORDER. AND STRANGLED HER ON HER FRONT PORCH THE NEIGHBORS CALL ON FORCE. HE WAS ONLY CHARGED WITH A VIOLATION BECAUSE THEY LOOK THE THING HE HAD ANOTHER CASE SOMEWHERE ELSE THERE LIKE HE'S GONNA GO TO JAIL ANYWAY. HE'S NOT CHARGE FOR THE CRIME AGAINST HER. SO IT'S THESE LITTLE THINGS THAT SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS. OR THE ARE THE ARE THE ARE THE ELEMENTS OF THINGS THAT CAUSE BARRIERS FOR VICTIMS. WHAT JURISDICTION WAS AT AND MISS BROWN -- NOTHING SHE LIVES ANA DEL PASO HEIGHTS AREA ONE OF YOU KNOW CARMICHAEL AREA. SO I'VE STRUCTURE COUNTY IN. THANK YOU AYE WHO WERE M. AND THAT'S AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF OF THESE HEARINGS TO HEAR THESE DIFFERENT STORIES AND SCENARIOS. UP BECAUSE WE HELPING THEM YET SO WE HAVE. YOU KNOW WHEN VISION OF WHAT THIS IS BUT IT IT'S SO MUCH MORE AND I THINK YOU APPRECIATE ABOUT THE COMMENTS AND YOU KNOW AND AGAIN MY MY STAFF IS HERE. HE ONE LEAVE NUMBERS AND I DEFINITELY -- CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS WHEN WE HAVE MORE HEARINGS SO THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH IDEAS OF OF PROPOSALS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ARE. YOU KNOW THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THERE IS IS APPALLING YEAH THAT I THINK. YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE TRYING -- TO TO JUST CITING FIVE VIOLATIONS THAT OF OF THE ACTUAL CRME SO AGAIN PLEASE -- YOU KNOW REACH OUT TO US AND WE WILL GIVE YOU INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH ACTUAL TANGIBLE SOLUTION SOOTHING AND YOU KNOW AND IT'S NEVER ABOUT POINTING OUT WHAT SOMEBODY DID WRONG OVER HERE SOMEBODY DIVINE I HEAR IT'S COLLECTIVELY ACROSS OUR COUNTY IN IN OUR STATE. JUST REALLY HONING DOWN ON WHAT IS THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT WE ARE OVERLOOKING OR THAT'S NOT DIDN'T TALK OR NOT GET AND SHOWED OR NOT GET ADDRESS SO THAT WEEK ALL TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY CAN SAY HEY. LET'S. GET RID OF THIS THIS IS NOT OKAY AND MOVE ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON -- THIS IS MY SON JOHN. MY DOLLAR AUTUMN IS SITTING BACK HERE MANY MISS ACTUALLY. SHERRY I AM NOT HERE IN REPRESENTATION OF ANY AGENCY I'M ACTUALLY HERE REPRESENTATION OF pMY LITTLE FAMILY AND OTHER FAMILIES LIKE MINE -- ALTHOUGH I DO CURRENTLY WORK FOR A RAPE CRISIS CENTER WITHIN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I'M AGAIN NOT HERE IN REPRESENTATION OF THEM. BUT LIKE SO MANY OTHERS HERE IN THE I WAS MOVED I'M ALMOST BROUGHT TO TEARS AT ONE POINT AS ONE SO MANY THINGS -- THAT OTHERS ON THE PANELS WERE SHARING WITH YOU ALL THAT MY LITTLE FAMILY HAS GONE THROUGH AND EVEN IN SOME WAYS IT'S STILL GOING THROUGH I'M I THINK THE CONSISTENCY I AM NOT A LOT OF THE PANELS. PANELIST ARM EMPHASIZED WAS HOWELL ON THE COMING OUT EVEN NOW THE AFTER NOT HAVING THE IMMEDIATE BEING IN THE IMMEDIATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOW YOUR LIFE IS STILL. SO DRASTICALLY IN DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED AND MYSELF AS A SINGLE MOTHER ON ONE OF MY ARM. BIGGEST THINGS EVERYDAY IS I'M TRYING TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THIS NEXT GENERATION THAT MY CHILDREN ARE PART OF BECAUSE WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE AND WE THAT WERE SITTING HERE AS ADULTS. ARE IN THE GROUND AND OUR DAYS ON THIS EARTH ARE GONE THESE ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA BE FOLLOWING IN OUR FOOTSTEPS AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY I BROUGHT MY CHILDREN TODAY I WANTED THEM TO SEE FIRSTHAND. THAT YOU CAN OME AND YOU CAN TAKE THE STEPS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO TRY TO CHANGE THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH AND JUST EVEN -- ONE THING THAT REALLY JUST STOOD OUT TO ME THAT HAS BEEN AND HAD BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR US IS THAT ALL WERE ABUSER -- WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE BECAUSE HE HAD MORE MONEY THAN WE DID WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE THE COURT SYSTEMS. AS A MEANS TO BE ABLE TO ABUSE US ARM HE WAS ABLE TO FILE FOR WHATEVER HE WANTED WHICH MEANT THAT. I WOULD HAVE TO SHOW UP A COURT. AND THAT MEANT THAT I HAD TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM AND THAT MEET MY CHILDREN HOW TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM HE WAS ABLE TO FILE. FOR READING OF REUNIFICATION THERAPY AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH REQUIRED ME TO HAVE TO BRING MY CHILDREN TO SACRAMENTO SUPERIOR COURT. AND THEN BE THERE HE ACTUALLY IMPORTS BUSH DOES IN THE LOBBY PAID SOMEONE TO AMBUSH US IN THE LOBBY AND NO. ONE NOT EVEN THAT THIS THAT THE SHARE OF STANDING THERE CAME TO OUR AID. AND THEN AFTER THAT. I HAD TO WALK INTO COURT. WORRIED ABOUT HER SAFETY. TRY TO DEFEND OUR FAMILY WHEN HE HAD AN ATTORNEY HAD THE MONEY HAD EVERYTHING THAT HE NEEDED AND I HAD TO STAY AND TRY TO STAY COMPOSED BECAUSE ALL THE WHILE. OUR ABUSER WAS TRYING TO USE THAT AS A MEANS TO SHOW THAT I WAS EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE AND SO THROUGHOUT ALL THE YEARS THAT WE WENT THROUGH THIS ONGOING ABUSE AFTER EVEN GETTING OUT OF THE IMAGE IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE -- WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GO AND SEEK OUT [inaudible] ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OUR CONFIDENTIALITY. WAS NOTHING THERE WAS NOTHING IN PLACE THAT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OR DOT. COM REALLY SEEMED ALLOTTED TO US BECAUSE EVEN WHEN WE WENT FOR COUNTY SERVICES HE MANAGED TO FIND A WAY LIKE SOMEONE OTHER SAID IN HERE EARLIER. ARM TO CONVINCE EVEN YOLO COUNTY AIDS THAT WE WERE STILL TOGETHER HE LIVED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE LIVE AND HAVE LEAD HERE BACK HOME WHERE I GREW UP. AND HAD EVEN APPLY FOR SERVICES WITH US ON THE THING AND I HAD NEVER BEEN OUT THERE. HOW HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT I HAVE NO CLUE TO THE STATE BUT? EVEN WITH THAT BEING SAID SO WHILE WE WERE GETTING COUNTY SERVICES OUT HERE AND HE WAS GETTING COUNTY SERVICES OUT THERE. CLAIMING THAT WE WERE STILL FAMILY TOGETHER LIVING TOGETHER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I ENDED UP HAVING TO PAY FOR WHAT HE RECEIVED. MY WAGES WERE GARNISHED. I HAD BEEN WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS IN MIND YOU HAD LOST MANY JOBS BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE THE SYSTEM TO PULL ME INTO COURT ALMOST ONCE A WEEK ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR YEARS. JUST ONGOING ONGOING ONGOING WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SO MANY FAMILIES LIKE MINE ARE GOING THROUGH BECAUSE EVEN SOMETHING AS AS SMALL BUT AS GRAND AS CONFIDENTIALITY WE WERE UNABLE TO REACH OUT. TO EVEN GET EMOTIONAL SERVICES TAKING CARE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING IN PLACE THAT WOULD PREVENT IT OUR ABUSER FROM USING THAT AGAINST ME. AS A MEANS OF WEAKNESS TO SHOW UP SHE'S EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE. YOU CAN'T HOW CAN YOU GRANT CUSTODY TO THESE CHILDREN YOUR HONOR IF. SHE'S EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE SO EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS AND HASN'T REALLY BEEN THAT LONG. WHAT'S IN PLACE FOR PEOPLE LIKE US WHO HAVE THAT FEAR THAT WE CAN'T REACH OUT TO THESE DIFFERENT SERVICES BECAUSE OUR CONFIDENTIALITY MAY BE BROKEN BECAUSE THAT MAY PUT US IN FEAR. YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT MY CHILDREN AT NINE ELEVEN THEY KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE TO RUN THEY KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE TO LIVE IN A CAR BECAUSE WE WERE IN A SYSTEM WHERE THE COUNTY DIDN'T GIVE US ENOUGH MONEY. TO ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO GET OFF OF AID AND ACTUALLY LIVE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS WE LIVE WITHIN A SYSTEM WHERE THAT COUNTY SYSTEM ACTUALLY MADE US FEEL LIKE WORSE THAN WHAT WE DID WHEN WE WERE BEING ABUSED. AN HOUR ABUSER HE LITERALLY USED TO RATION OUT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD AND WATER THAT WE COULD CONSUME SO TO SAY THAT A COUNTY SYSTEM WHICH WE WERE WITHIN YOLO COUNTY. MADE US FEEL LESS THAN EVERY TIME I HAD TO WALK IN THAT DOOR EVERY TIME I HAD TO MAKE A PHONE CALL EVERYTIME I HAD THE QUESTIONER ASKED ABOUT. IF WE COULD WERE ALLOTTED SERVICES AND I WON'T EVEN GET STARTED ON HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO NOT ONLY GET. FUNDING FOR CHILDCARE TO EVEN MAINTAIN A JOB WITHIN THE COUNTY SYSTEM BUT TO MAINTAIN THAT HORRENDOUS. HOW MANY TIMES MY CHILDREN WATCHED THEIR MOTHER SPOKEN DOWN? TO TALK TO ACT BELITTLED. SO I SAY ALL THAT TO SAY THIS IF WHEN YOU WALL ARE CONSIDERING THESE LAWS CONCERNING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND INCREASES IN GRANTS AND WHICH GRANTS YOU'RE GONNA PLACE WHERE IF YOU COULD TAKE THE THINGS THAT NOT ONLY MYSELF AND OTHERS IN THIS ROOM HAVE SPOKEN OUT ABOUT INTO. GRAVE CONSIDERATION BECAUSE IT IS A REAL THING IT IS A REALITY IT SICKENS MY HEART TO THINK THAT. EVEN IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE AND THAT I AM DOING IN LIFE TO TRY TO CREATE STABILITY FOR MY FAMILY. EVEN WORKING A FULL TIME JOB THAT DOESN'T EVEN ALLOW ME ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN STABILITY AND CREATE ONGOING STABILITY FOR MY CHILDREN AND POSITIVE CONSISTENCY. I CAN'T REACH OUT TO A COUNTY SERVICE BECAUSE I'M WOULD CONSIDER HAVE BE CONSIDERED MAKING TOO MUCH. IF MY EXPERTISE TELL SUPPORT CONSISTENTLY FOR A FEW MONTHS THEN I'M DISQUALIFIED FROM GETTING AID BECAUSE OF THAT BUT YET WE'VE GONE THROUGH THAT AND WE'VE LIVED IN OUR CAR. BEING CONSIDERED MAKING TOO MUCH BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER HAS A JOB WHERE AS IF I DIDN'T HAVE A JOB THEN SOCIETY SAYS TO ME. I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME I NEED TO GET UP AND I NEED TO GET A JOB SOCIETY SAYS TO ME I'M JUST ANOTHER STATISTIC. THAT FALLS IN THAT POVERTY LINE IN THAT GAP. OF IN THAT CLASS OF MINORITIES THAT SIT AROUND AND WE JUST DO NOTHING WHEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND SO EVEN SITTING HERE TODAY. I I WANT TO SHOW MY KIDS. THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT SIDE THAT NOT ONLY CAN SOMETHING BE DONE BUT THAT SOMEBODY WALKS THE STAND UP AND LISTEN AND DO SOMETHING SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME THINGS THAT I'VE GOING THROUGH SO THAT EVEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO WATCH THEIR MOTHER FOR THE REST. OF HER LIFE HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING FIGHTING FIGHTING TO JUST BARELY MAKE ENDS MEET THE FACT THAT -- EVEN THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN PLACE TO AID WOMEN LIKE ME WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH STUFF LIKE THIS AND LIKE I SAID I WORK FOR A RAPE CRISIS CENTER RIGHT NOW. WHO SERVICES THAT MY FAMILY COULD UTILIZE WOULD WOULD HELP US SO MUCH BUT I CAN'T EVEN UTILIZED BECAUSE I WORK FOR THE RAPE CRISIS CENTER? AND NOT IS CONSIDERED NOT OKAY WHEN IT PERTAINS TO THAT BUT EVEN TAKING IN CONSIDERATION FUNDING. FOR TING SPECIFICALLY LIKE THAT FOR PEOPLE LIKE US WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE'VE GOTTEN PAST THE IMMEDIATE AND WE'VE BEEN OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT AND OR EVEN A FEW YEARS AND WE STILL HAVE THIS TRAIL. THAT IS ATTACHED TO US FROM THE ABUSE THAT WE STILL NEED TO TAKE CARE BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BECAUSE I WANT MY CHILDREN TO GROW OPEN HOUSE BUT I CAN'T AFFORD THAT. I WANT MY CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO GET HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE BUT MOST OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING NOT ONLY IS IT. THAT ARE THE WAITING LIST EXACERBATED BUT THERE IN SOME OF THE MOST VIOLENT WORST NEIGHBORHOODS. AND TO BE AND TO MY CHILDREN IT SAYS. YOU'RE NOT WORTH [inaudible] LIVING LIKE. OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD GET TO LIVE. AND THEN I'M FIGHTING AND OTHER PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE FIGHTING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STOP THAT CYCLE SO THAT WEEK OUR CHILDREN CAN HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE. BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY'S OUT THERE BREAKING THE LAW AND NOT FOR THE THING YOU KNOW AND THAT'S NO PUN TOWARDS ANYONE BECAUSE YOU HEY YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO IN ORDER TO GET BY. I KNOW I DID FOR MY CHILDREN WHEN I HAD NOBODY I KNOW I STILL DO [inaudible] SO. I THINK YOU FOR LISTENING I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME HERE TODAY I THINK YOU FOR TAKING ALL OF THIS INTO CONSIDERATION. ARM. I HOPE THAT LEAVING HERE ON THAT THE FACES OF MY CHILDREN WILL BE EDGEDINTO YOU YOU ALSO BRAIN WHEN YOU'RE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THESE DIFFERENT LAWS THAT YOU'RE MAKING AND THE COMING BECAUSE THEY VERY MUCH SO AFFECT US [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE JUST SO YOU KNOW I HAVE A TENURE THAN AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD SO I I CAN TELL THAT THERE THAT THE SAME AGE AND EVEN THOUGH MY SITUATION IS NOT THE SAME AS YOURS -- TRUST AND BELIEVE THAT -- MY HEART AND I THINK ALL OF OUR LEGISLATORS OUGHT LEGISLATORS HEARTS ARE WITH YOU -- THERE'S MANY -- VERY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS FOR ALL OF US BUT I THINK WE ALL CAME HERE TO HOPEFULLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF OF HOW WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR THE KIDS FOR BRITAIN FOR BRINGING THE KIDS I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO SEE THAT THERE IS PEOPLE THAT ARE LISTENING. AND IT MIGHT NOT BE IMMEDIATE AND THE LIKE I SAID EARLIER TODAY WITH A MAGIC WAND THAT WE'RE GONNA FIX EVERYTHING BUT LITTLE STEPS. TOWARD THAT GOAL I THINK IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU. ONLY FEEL LUIS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF TWO ORGANIZATIONS I AM PROUD REPRESENT THE FIRST THING CALIFORNIA LATINAS FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE NAY HEARD PREVIOUSLY ABOUT HOW INTERNET LEADERS HAVE FREEDOM FROM VIOLENCE AS A CORE TENET OF WHAT IT TRULY MEANS. TAP CHOICE WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO HAVE A FAMILY IS YOUR FAMILY ABLE TO BE SAFE IS YOUR HOME ABLE TO BE SAFE ARE YOU ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES AND RESOURCES. NEEDED TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN EAT YOU HOP AND SO WE THINK ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE WE HAVE TO THINK OF IT COMPLETELY ALIGNED WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO BE SAFE IN YOUR COMMUNITY SAFE IN YOUR HOME. SAFE GETTING TO WORK AND WHEN WE TALK WITH SPECIAL OR YOU KNOW AT RISK POPULATIONS IN THOSE WHO. HAVE IMMIGRATED HERE. IS YOUR DOCUMENTATION STATUS BEING USED AS A MECHANISM TO CONTROL. AND THOSE TYPES OF FREEDOMS ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IN REALLY ENSURE THAT WE'RE HAVING DIVERSE VOICES. AND EXPERIENCES WHICH IS WHY HAVING SO MANY PEOPLE SPEAK TODAY IS SO VITAL SO THINKING FOR A TIME YOU KNOW BE RECEPTIVE AND YOU KNOW WE KNOW ON THESE ISSUES. MANY OF YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN YOU KNOW ALLIED WITH WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS -- SECOND ORGANIZATION IS CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING IN WORKING WITH CONSUMER GROUPS AND COALITIONS ON WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE. ECONOMIC ACCESS YOU'VE HEARD PERSONAL STORIES OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS HAVING THOSE THREATENS WHAT IT MEANS TO ACCESS. MONEY WHEN YOU NEED IT BECAUSE I HAVE. ACCESS TO CREDIT ACCESS TO SOMETHING SEPARATE ACCOUNT AWAY FROM YOUR ABUSER THOSE ARE PATHWAYS TO FREEDOM WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WHEN YOU'RE ACCESSING THEM THAT THEY'RE DONE IN A JUST WAY. AND THEN NOT YOU'RE NOT BEING YOUR VULNERABILITIES NOT BEING EXPLOITED BY BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE. YOU KNOW JEOPARDIZING WHETHER IT'S LOANS ON YOUR CAR HOW YOU GET RENTS PAID WHETHER YOU'RE ABLE TO YOU KNOW PROTECT YOURSELF FROM EVICTION THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. AND WE HAVE TO THINK OF THE VULNERABILITIES THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT RISK POPULATIONS -- UP BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT HAPPEN TO GET SOMEWHERE IN FRONT OF THE STATE IS THAT OF A FAMILY MEMBER HILL. YOU LEFT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. AND TO WATCH. YOU KNOW COUSIN HAVE TO LEAVE WORK. AFTER STEP AWAY FROM HER FULL LIFE. BUT SHE ASKED FOR HELP. AND SO TO HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS AVAILABLE TO PULL THEM OUT. NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THOSE. ACTIONS AREN'T THERE. WHAT'S AVAILABLE AS A LOBBYIST WE HAVE DIFFERENT ACCESS AND KNOWING PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO POWER YOU KNOW IF WE CAN WALK TO OFFICES. THAT'S NOT THE SAME FOR PEOPLE OUT IN THE COMMUNITIES SO JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN TO TO IN TO HELP DELIVER THE MESSAGES. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING SMART RESOURCES AND I WERE LISTENING TO SERVICES THAT REALLY HAVE AN IMPACT AT THE END OF THE DAY. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING TO US LAND FOR MY MANY HATS THAT I WEAR BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
