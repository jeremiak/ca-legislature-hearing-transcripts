I'M YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE EVERY

00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:05.236 region:rollup2
SINGLE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE

00:40:03.635 --> 00:40:07.572 region:rollup2
AUDITOR MADE THAT WAS DUE IN

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:08.940 region:rollup2
APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

00:40:07.572 --> 00:40:10.541 region:rollup2
IN A JANUARY UPDATE TO THE LED

TO THE STATE REGARDING THE

00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:12.277 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE

00:40:11.042 --> 00:40:13.678 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THE AUDITOR

NOTED THAT YOU SEE HAD FULLY

00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:16.180 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED ONE OF THESE

00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:17.515 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.483 region:rollup2
PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ANOTHER

00:40:17.515 --> 00:40:20.184 region:rollup2
THAT LEFT MOST OF THESE

00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:22.153 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS LEFT TO BE OF

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:23.321 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED. A LOT HAS CHANGED

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:24.589 region:rollup2
SINCE JANUARY SO YOU HAVE AN

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:26.291 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO ASK YOU SEE ABOUT

00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:26.891 region:rollup2
HOW IT FEELS.

00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:28.126 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS MET THESE REPAIR

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:30.728 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THE AUDITOR

00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:32.864 region:rollup2
DID NOTE. ON SOME CONCERNS THAT

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:33.965 region:rollup2
IT IT HAD SEEN SOME SIGNALS FROM

00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:35.166 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY INDICATING

00:40:33.965 --> 00:40:36.367 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY MIGHT NOT MAKE A

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:36.868 region:rollup2
GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO IT

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.036 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE

00:40:36.868 --> 00:40:39.103 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:40:38.036 --> 00:40:40.371 region:rollup2
SO FOR THAT REASON WE DO THINK

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:41.339 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY HERE

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:43.608 region:rollup2
REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT.

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:45.543 region:rollup2
THE AUDITOR AND ULTIMATELY THE

00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:46.978 region:rollup2

00:40:46.978 --> 00:40:49.747 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO MEET THESE

00:40:47.412 --> 00:40:50.648 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:52.350 region:rollup2
ON THE TRANSFER ISSUE.

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:53.618 region:rollup2
.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:54.886 region:rollup2
WHAT WE THINK IT'S A BASED ON

00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:56.621 region:rollup2
DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM YOU

00:40:54.886 --> 00:40:58.189 region:rollup2
SEE IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT TO THE

00:40:56.621 --> 00:41:00.625 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES RIVERSIDE AND SANTA

00:40:58.189 --> 00:41:01.225 region:rollup2

I BECAUSE OF THAT IT THE

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:07.632 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WILL. HAVE TO

THIS.

00:41:18.743 --> 00:41:22.146 region:rollup2
WHAT ASSESSMENT BASED ON?

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:23.581 region:rollup2

TRANSFER REFORM. JUST A SOME

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:31.622 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND THE STATE HAS LONG

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:33.091 region:rollup2
TRIED TO SIMPLIFY THE TRANSFER

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:34.525 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR STUDENTS ON

00:41:33.091 --> 00:41:35.593 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY STUDENTS HAVE FACED

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:37.128 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:38.796 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON WHICH CAMPUS THEY

00:41:37.128 --> 00:41:40.698 region:rollup2
WANTED TO TRANSFER TO. SO IF

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:43.101 region:rollup2
THEY WANTED TO TRANSFER TO A UC

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:45.470 region:rollup2

REQUIREMENTS.

00:41:47.105 --> 00:41:48.606 region:rollup2
AND THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:50.174 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO SORT OF PLAN WHICH

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:52.477 region:rollup2

ON AN EFFORT TO REFORM THAT THE

00:41:52.477 --> 00:41:54.579 region:rollup2
STATE'S.

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:55.913 region:rollup2
REFORM THE TRANSFER PROCESS

ASSOCIATE REFER TRANSFERRED BUT

00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:35.620 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES.

00:42:34.986 --> 00:42:36.921 region:rollup2
ON IT THEY JUST THESE PATHWAYS

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.757 region:rollup2
GENERALLY REQUIRE SOMEWHAT

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:41.392 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COURSES IN A NUMBER OF

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:42.260 region:rollup2
CASES OFTEN MORE.

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.494 region:rollup2
MAJOR PREPARE TO RECORD SAYS

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.695 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T GUARANTEE A STUDENT

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:45.730 region:rollup2
CAN COMPLETE WITH A HUNDRED

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:47.064 region:rollup2
TWENTY UNITS THEY DON'T

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.565 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE A STUDENT CAN GRADUATE

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:50.501 region:rollup2
I I CAN.

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:51.469 region:rollup2
IS ADMITTED TO THE SYSTEM.

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.270 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST

00:42:51.469 --> 00:42:53.938 region:rollup2
TRANSFER PATHWAYS ARE NOT

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.239 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE DEGREES.

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:56.407 region:rollup2

TRANSFER PATHWAYS.

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:10.388 region:rollup2
IT ALSO LISTS OTHER THINGS YOU

00:43:09.387 --> 00:43:11.889 region:rollup2
YOU SEE MIGHT EXPLORE IN THE

00:43:10.388 --> 00:43:13.424 region:rollup2
FUTURE AT ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:14.692 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT YOU SEE IS

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:15.793 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING CREEK THAT. WORKING

00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:16.894 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:18.162 region:rollup2
CREATE A SEPARATE AN ASSOCIATE

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:20.598 region:rollup2
DEGREE FOR TRANSFER THAT'S

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:21.432 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO YOU SEE.

00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:22.800 region:rollup2
AS YOU THINKING ABOUT THE SORT

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:24.235 region:rollup2
OF A DECISIONS REGARDING TRANCE

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.903 region:rollup2
REFORM WE WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE

00:43:24.235 --> 00:43:27.505 region:rollup2
YOU TO THINK ABOUT WAYS TO

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:29.307 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFY THE TRANSFER PROCESS.

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:29.907 region:rollup2
I'M FOR STUDENTS WHETHER OR NOT

00:43:29.307 --> 00:43:30.942 region:rollup2
THEY GO TO SEE US YOU WERE YOU

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:32.977 region:rollup2
SEE.

00:43:30.942 --> 00:43:34.245 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES THAT

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:35.513 region:rollup2
MIGHT RESULT FROM SOME OF THESE

00:43:34.245 --> 00:43:36.447 region:rollup2
POLICY CHANGES THAT YOU SEE IS

00:43:35.513 --> 00:43:37.648 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING IS THAT IT COULD

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:38.983 region:rollup2
JUST ADD A LITTLE MORE

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:40.485 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY. THAT'S BECAUSE

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:42.453 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WILL FACE BOTH AN

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:43.454 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER OF

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.822 region:rollup2
FOR CSU OR THEY COULD TAKE ONE

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:45.890 region:rollup2
FOR YOU SEE BUT THEY STILL FACE

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:46.757 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:49.460 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SO IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:50.728 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PLAN AND. THINK ABOUT

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.863 region:rollup2
GOING INTO ONE IS SORT OF ON.

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:53.264 region:rollup2
I THINK ABOUT GOING TO A YOU YOU

00:43:51.863 --> 00:43:54.866 region:rollup2
SEE CAMPUS BUT THAT HAVE SORT OF

00:43:53.264 --> 00:43:58.970 region:rollup2
A BACK UP CSU CAMPUS THAT MIGHT

00:43:54.866 --> 00:43:59.604 region:rollup2
BE LESS SELECTIVE THAT THEY

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.104 region:rollup2
STILL FACED IF THEY MIGHT STILL

00:43:59.604 --> 00:44:01.439 region:rollup2
FACE DIFFERENT OF COURSE

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:02.039 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS SO. THAT THAT COULD

00:44:01.439 --> 00:44:02.907 region:rollup2
ADD TO SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:04.208 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:44:02.907 --> 00:44:04.842 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME THINGS TO

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.476 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT IS YOUR REVIEWING.

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.644 region:rollup2

SENATE CREWS AND RIVERSIDE

00:45:07.672 --> 00:45:13.344 region:rollup2

OUR LARGER.

DATA SYSTEMS ON THE CAMPUSES

00:54:47.518 --> 00:54:51.789 region:rollup2
HALF TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:53.223 region:rollup2
OTHER OR. THE. ANALYSIS SIMPLY

00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:54.858 region:rollup2
ISN'T.

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:56.426 region:rollup2
NOT RELIABLE THAT THERE WAS A

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:57.928 region:rollup2
MASSIVE HURDLE RIVERSIDE WAS AN

00:54:56.426 --> 00:55:00.063 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS CHOICE BOARD THIS

00:54:57.928 --> 00:55:01.765 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAD. IN PLACE A NEW

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:04.601 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTING SYSTEM THAT CONNECTED

00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:06.837 region:rollup2
THEIR. FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING WITH

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:10.541 region:rollup2
THEIR CLASSROOM DATA. AND.

00:55:06.837 --> 00:55:12.509 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS RATES DATA PALM

00:55:10.541 --> 00:55:14.378 region:rollup2
AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO

00:55:12.509 --> 00:55:16.480 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS MORE BROADLY.

00:55:14.378 --> 00:55:18.916 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE ALSO FOUND WAS THAT

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.551 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS TENDED TO BE VERY

00:55:18.916 --> 00:55:22.419 region:rollup2
SILO THAT IT WAS NOT.

00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:23.954 region:rollup2
COMPARATIVO FROM ONE UC TO

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:25.989 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND EVEN FROM ONE

00:55:23.954 --> 00:55:26.890 region:rollup2
COLLEGE TO ANOTHER ON CAMPUS IT

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.892 region:rollup2
WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE THOSE

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:30.427 region:rollup2
COMPARISONS.

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:32.830 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE.

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:35.199 region:rollup2
THE ACTIVITY BASED COSTING

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:38.502 region:rollup2
TRIES TO CAPTURE. A VERY

00:55:35.199 --> 00:55:40.470 region:rollup2
DETAILED PRODUCTION COST FOR.

00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:44.041 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY A NEW STUDENT.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:45.843 region:rollup2
A UNIT OF EDUCATION RATHER THAN

00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:47.511 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE CURRENTLY DO IT IS

00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:49.279 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT LARGER SCALE MARGINAL

00:55:47.511 --> 00:55:50.380 region:rollup2
COST ACROSS.

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:52.382 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF A NEW

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:54.585 region:rollup2
STUDENT.

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:56.987 region:rollup2
SO IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:55:54.585 --> 00:55:58.388 region:rollup2
OBTAIN DETAILED LEVEL.

00:55:56.987 --> 00:56:00.190 region:rollup2
DATA TO ACTUALLY DO THAT

00:55:58.388 --> 00:56:02.192 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:04.628 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE MANAGERS COMPLAIN

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:07.898 region:rollup2
THAT THE. ACTIVITY BASED COSTING

00:56:04.628 --> 00:56:09.633 region:rollup2
PROVIDED THEM WITH COST DATA BUT

00:56:07.898 --> 00:56:11.268 region:rollup2
NOT WITH QUALITY DATA. SO THAT

00:56:09.633 --> 00:56:12.502 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO WAY TO TELL WHICH

00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:16.306 region:rollup2
COURSE WAS ACTUALLY MORE

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:17.140 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE. OR WAS OF A BETTER

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:19.376 region:rollup2
QUALITY THAN ANOTHER.

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:20.010 region:rollup2
AND A.

00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:22.112 region:rollup2
THEY WERE BUT RECESSED INTO THE

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:26.183 region:rollup2
HOT.

00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:27.718 region:rollup2
THE.

00:56:26.183 --> 00:56:28.285 region:rollup2
IN THE DISCUSSION WE HAD FOUR

00:56:27.718 --> 00:56:30.020 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO AND I KNOW YOU ARE

00:56:28.285 --> 00:56:31.488 region:rollup2
HERE THAT.

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.123 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE VALUES OF ACTIVITY

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:34.024 region:rollup2
BASED COSTING WHICH

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:35.959 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY COME FROM THE

00:56:34.024 --> 00:56:38.629 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL WORLD.

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:40.931 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT JUST JUST DETERMINE.

00:56:38.629 --> 00:56:42.966 region:rollup2
THE COST OF AN ACTIVITY BUT THE

00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:44.768 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY OF THE ACTIVITY.

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:47.371 region:rollup2
SO YOU TELLING ME.

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:49.606 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:56:47.371 --> 00:56:51.341 region:rollup2
FROM THE UNIVERSITY.

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:53.510 region:rollup2
WHO TEACHES ACTIVITY BASED

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:56.013 region:rollup2
COSTING?

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:59.016 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY.

00:56:56.013 --> 00:57:00.317 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP A MODEL TO DEFINE.

00:56:59.016 --> 00:57:04.087 region:rollup2
THE EFFICIENCIES AND

00:57:00.317 --> 00:57:05.923 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS IN THE COST.

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:08.258 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA

00:57:05.923 --> 00:57:10.260 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS TO BRING IN ALL THE DATA

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:12.195 region:rollup2
NEEDED FOR THE COMPLETE ANALYSIS

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:13.897 region:rollup2
ON OUR CAMPUSES.

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:14.998 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NOT HERE BUT IT MAY BE

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:17.734 region:rollup2

REVIEWED AT THIS POINT.

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:13.977 region:rollup2
.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:15.512 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:17.481 region:rollup2

ESTABLISHING BUDGET TARGETS FOR

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:27.591 region:rollup2
EACH OF THEM. SO GOING FORWARD

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.993 region:rollup2
FROM HERE.

01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:31.795 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IN

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:33.964 region:rollup2
ORDER TO IMPROVE MANAGEMENT

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:35.932 region:rollup2
REPORTING AND TO DRIVE BETTER

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:37.601 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF ALL PROJECT

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:40.704 region:rollup2
TRACKING AND ACCOUNTABILITY USE.

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:43.173 region:rollup2
AS THIS LIST THE PROGRAMS WILL

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:44.574 region:rollup2
BE REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND WILL BE

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:46.309 region:rollup2
PRESENTED TO THE REGION'S FOR

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:47.978 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION OF WHICH PROGRAM

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:51.114 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE SCALED BACK AND WHICH

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:52.449 region:rollup2
ARE. UP PROVIDING USEFUL NEST

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:53.950 region:rollup2
BUT THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS BEING.

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:54.851 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED TO EACH OF THOSE

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:56.319 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:57.921 region:rollup2
SHARE WHAT I THINK THERE'S TWO

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.688 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THAT ANY TALKED ABOUT

01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:00.557 region:rollup2
THE TRACKING IN TRANSPARENCY

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:02.092 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:03.560 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PART OF IT AND WE WEEK

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:05.195 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAVE THAT THE LAST TWO

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.998 region:rollup2
YEARS BUT AS FAR AS.

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:10.033 region:rollup2
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:11.635 region:rollup2
TO TO POTENTIALLY DO SOMETHING

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:13.937 region:rollup2
ELSE WITH WITH THOSE RESOURCES

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:15.605 region:rollup2
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THE

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:18.275 region:rollup2
TIMELINE THAT WE COULD SEE. A

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:19.943 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE REGENTS.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:20.744 region:rollup2
AND THAT YOU SEE ON THAT CONCERT

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:22.178 region:rollup2
WITH SOMETHING THAT THAT WE

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:24.180 region:rollup2
COULD DO ON OUR OWN BUT HAVING

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:26.182 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK FROM.

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.485 region:rollup2
THE THE UC IS CERTAINLY HELPFUL.

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:29.986 region:rollup2
OF THE UC OP BUDGET WILL BE

01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:31.621 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED BY THE REGION'S AND

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:33.557 region:rollup2
THEIR MAY MEETING. AND.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:34.958 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE IT AGENDA ITEM LATER

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:36.726 region:rollup2
ON DO YOU SEE A PIECE BUDGET

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:38.962 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY IMPACT STATE BUDGET

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:40.430 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR COULD DISCUSS THAT WITH

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:43.266 region:rollup2
YOU FURTHER AT THAT TIME.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:45.302 region:rollup2
BUT GOING FORWARD THE EXECUTIVE

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:48.305 region:rollup2
DO YOU SEE PRESIDENT AND.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:50.307 region:rollup2
THE FINANCE TEAM WITHIN UC

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:52.242 region:rollup2
OPIATE AS WELL AS THE STUDENT

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:53.376 region:rollup2
SERVICES ACADEMIC TEAMS WILL

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:55.946 region:rollup2
CONSIDER PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:57.581 region:rollup2
NECESSARY AND. DEVELOP AN ANNUAL

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:59.516 region:rollup2
BUDGET FOR THE REGION'S TO

01:01:57.581 --> 01:01:59.983 region:rollup2
CONSIDER AND CONTINUE. PROGRAMS

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:02.018 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PROVING TO BE

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:03.920 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE.

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:05.922 region:rollup2
AND NOW THAT WE HAVE REALLY DONE

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.892 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE BUDGET TRACKING WE

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:11.027 region:rollup2
HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:13.029 region:rollup2
OF WHICH PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:14.931 region:rollup2
RESULTS FOR THE DOLLARS SPENT.

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:16.900 region:rollup2
SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THIS

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:19.002 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE A RECOMMENDATION FOR

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.436 region:rollup2
FOR THIS. BUT BUDGET YEAR

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:23.073 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL ACTION AND

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:25.508 region:rollup2
REDIRECTION.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:26.376 region:rollup2
HE SAID AS A MATE REPORT BUDGET

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:27.310 region:rollup2
REPORT COMING OUT FROM THE

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:28.878 region:rollup2
REGION'S WITH WOMEN BY THAT IN

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:30.046 region:rollup2
MAY THE REGION'S WILL CONSIDER

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:32.549 region:rollup2
THE USE YOUR P. EIGHTEEN

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:34.317 region:rollup2
NINETEEN BUDGET. THE REDIRECTION

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:36.086 region:rollup2
OF FUNDS FOR INVOLVEMENT IN

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:38.121 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HAS ALREADY

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:40.223 region:rollup2
BEEN. BROAD CATEGORIES HAVE BEEN

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:41.591 region:rollup2
DETERMINED. AND WORK COMMUNICATE

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:43.093 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:44.561 region:rollup2
DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:46.096 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THAT FOR

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:48.064 region:rollup2
THE NEXT YEAR OF COURSE UC'S

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:51.534 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN CSU WEEK YOU KNOW

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:52.535 region:rollup2
BUDGET. FOR TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:54.804 region:rollup2
FOR A FRIEND ROME ITSELF.

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:55.839 region:rollup2
THERE'S A GLARING GAP IN THAT

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:57.574 region:rollup2
THE ACTION WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:59.476 region:rollup2
YEAR WOULD HAVE.

01:02:57.574 --> 01:03:00.977 region:rollup2
AT ZERO RESOURCES TO FURTHER

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:03.113 region:rollup2
EXPAND YOU SEE FOR OUR

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:03.780 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS SO.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.548 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.384 region:rollup2
US WELL WE THINK THAT THE

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:09.819 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY UNDERTAKEN

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:11.388 region:rollup2
BY YOU SEE OPIUM THESE PROGRAMS

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:13.089 region:rollup2
AND INITIATIVES CAMPED.

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:14.824 region:rollup2
VERY WELL BE REDIRECTED TO

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:17.661 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES FOR.

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:19.629 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT OR OTHER ACTIVITIES

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:21.431 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU SEE OP HAS DISTINCT

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.565 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS APART FROM THE

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:24.467 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES THAT ARE MORE

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:26.436 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY DONNA SYSTEM WIDE

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:28.471 region:rollup2
LEVEL. THOSE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:30.006 region:rollup2
OUR BOND MANAGEMENT OUR

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:31.508 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS ARE LEGAL.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:33.543 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:34.577 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES THAT CAN

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:36.279 region:rollup2
BE BETTER SERVED FROM A CENTRAL

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:37.881 region:rollup2
LOCATION SUCH AS OUR GLOBAL FOOD

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:39.416 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE.

01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:42.085 region:rollup2
AND ALSO.

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:45.155 region:rollup2
SERVICES FOR DOCTOR STUDENTS.

01:03:42.085 --> 01:03:47.123 region:rollup2
SO WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:49.359 region:rollup2
PLAN FOR ENDING ANY OF THOSE

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:51.094 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WHERE IF YOU SEE OP

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:53.630 region:rollup2
FUNDING WERE TO BE REDUCED.

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:54.698 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:56.533 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS ARE THAT

01:03:54.698 --> 01:03:58.134 region:rollup2
SERVE A WIDE POPULATION ON OUR

01:03:56.533 --> 01:04:00.370 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES.

01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:01.671 region:rollup2
WOULD SUFFER.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:04.541 region:rollup2
AND THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:06.276 region:rollup2
SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT.

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:07.877 region:rollup2
THE ELIMINATION YEAH. WELL I

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:08.945 region:rollup2
GUESS THAT'S A DESIRE FROM THE

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:10.647 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE IS WE WANT TO

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:13.350 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:14.617 region:rollup2
TO TO LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.952 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE HOME IN OUR DISTRICTS

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:17.854 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS DON'T ASK ABOUT

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:19.489 region:rollup2
SOME PROGRAM.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.090 region:rollup2
IT'S BURIED IN PAGE SEVEN

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.057 region:rollup2
HUNDRED OF THE REGION'S BUDGET

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:22.759 region:rollup2
THEY ASK.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:24.527 region:rollup2
WHY CAN'T OUR?

01:04:22.759 --> 01:04:26.029 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MEMBERS GET INTO THE

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:27.664 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:29.532 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE HEAR

01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:31.134 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE AND IT'S WELL CAN USE

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:32.936 region:rollup2
YEAR AFTER YEAR AND SO I THINK

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:34.738 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:36.473 region:rollup2
IS WE ARE COUNTING ON THE UC.

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:38.608 region:rollup2
TO WHAT WE ARE BURGER I DO OUR

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:41.444 region:rollup2
BEST TO TO FULLY FUND.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:42.078 region:rollup2
THE UC BUDGET REQUEST LIKE

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:43.546 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ISSUE

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:47.016 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO. BUT THAT PROVIDES

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:48.852 region:rollup2
NOT ONE PENNY TO EXPAND ACCESS

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:50.854 region:rollup2
YOU SEE ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS

01:04:48.852 --> 01:04:51.855 region:rollup2
AND SOME. UP WE WANT TO CONTINUE

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:52.055 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:53.757 region:rollup2
THESE.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:55.458 region:rollup2
.

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:56.993 region:rollup2
THESE INITIATIVES THAT WERE

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:58.194 region:rollup2
OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT LAST YEAR

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:59.729 region:rollup2
THAT WE WENT OVER FOR THE PAST

01:04:58.194 --> 01:05:01.030 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.666 region:rollup2
TWO LOOK AT POTENTIAL

INCREASES THAT THE UC. THE UC

01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:54.377 region:rollup2
SHOULD FOCUS INSTEAD ON REDUCING

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:55.745 region:rollup2
ITS COST STRUCTURE TO ENSURE

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:57.247 region:rollup2

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:21.070 region:rollup2
.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:22.505 region:rollup2
IF YOU OF THAT THIS IS A BUDGET

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:24.073 region:rollup2
THAT THE REGENTS DISCUSS THEY'VE

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:26.075 region:rollup2
NOT ADOPTED AT THEY HAVE ADOPTED

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:27.243 region:rollup2
SOME COMPONENTS OF IT BUT IT'S

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:29.145 region:rollup2
LARGELY SOMETHING THAT THE

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:30.947 region:rollup2
REGION'S HAVE DISCUSSED AND. ARE

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:32.849 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING ADOPTING AND IN MAY.

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:34.350 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT THIS TABLE DOES SHOW

01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:35.752 region:rollup2
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE IS

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.886 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FUNDS SOURCES THAT THE

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:38.655 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY BELIEVE IS

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.889 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATING TO HAVE? NOT JUST

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:41.391 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND BUT OTHER FUN

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:43.426 region:rollup2
SOURCES SUCH AS TUITION FROM

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:44.761 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE VERY SAVINGS THE

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:46.796 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY INTENDS TO.

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:47.196 region:rollup2
ANCHOR AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:49.332 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:50.033 region:rollup2
FUNDRAISERS LIKE THAT AND ON

01:07:49.332 --> 01:07:51.701 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE.

01:07:50.033 --> 01:07:53.536 region:rollup2
S. PLAYS HOW THE UNIVERSITY

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:55.271 region:rollup2
INTENDS TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:56.706 region:rollup2
OFFER COMPENSATION INCREASES.

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:57.840 region:rollup2
I ENROLLMENT GROWTH STUDENT

01:07:56.706 --> 01:07:59.676 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THINGS OF

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.677 region:rollup2
THAT NATURE.

01:07:59.676 --> 01:08:02.278 region:rollup2
OUR THIS BUDGET IS A LITTLE

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:03.813 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THEN THE GOVERNORS A

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:05.081 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IT IT IT IT IT

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:06.215 region:rollup2
DISSIPATES MORE FUNDING THAN THE

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.850 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR.

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:08.785 region:rollup2
IS PROPOSING FOR EXAMPLE AT

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:10.019 region:rollup2
THIS BUDGET DOES ASSUME A

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:11.554 region:rollup2
TUITION INCREASE

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:12.522 region:rollup2
IT ALSO SEEMS ADDITIONAL STATE

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:14.090 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND BUT.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:15.591 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS IN JANUARY

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.826 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO SORT OF GAUGE UNDER

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.261 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HOW MUCH

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:19.362 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU NEVER YOU SEE HAVE TO

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:21.097 region:rollup2
WORK WITH AND. WE GET SHOULD

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:21.731 region:rollup2
HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:22.865 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO WORK WITH AN EIGHTEEN

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:24.167 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:24.934 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT COULD

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:26.269 region:rollup2
THEY DO WITH A THREE HUNDRED

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.604 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:29.038 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATED THAT COULD COVER A

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:30.406 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE COST INCREASES THEY

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:32.075 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:32.575 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE. SORT

01:08:32.075 --> 01:08:34.477 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THEY CALL THEIR

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:35.878 region:rollup2
MANDATORY COSTS THAT MANDATORY

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:37.313 region:rollup2
COST INCLUDES THINGS LIKE

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:38.381 region:rollup2
BENEFIT COST INCREASES.

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:39.983 region:rollup2
SOME BASIC SERVER COST

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:41.317 region:rollup2
INCREASES

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:43.119 region:rollup2
AND AT SOME COMPENSATION

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:46.055 region:rollup2
INCREASES SPECIFICALLY FOR.

01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:46.990 region:rollup2
REP FOR REPRESENTED STAFF.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.958 region:rollup2
BUT COULD ALSO COVER A LOT OF

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:50.893 region:rollup2
THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT THE

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:52.829 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY IS ANTICIPATING.

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:54.597 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WAS WELL STUDENT

01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:55.999 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND EVEN

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:57.266 region:rollup2
AFTER THAT WOULD LEAVES OF ABOUT

01:08:55.999 --> 01:08:57.734 region:rollup2
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS LEFT

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:59.335 region:rollup2
OVER FOR OTHER SET OF

01:08:57.734 --> 01:09:00.169 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.704 region:rollup2
THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:03.072 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED SUCH AS COMPENSATION

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:04.607 region:rollup2
INCREASES FOR FACULTY AND ON

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:06.542 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED STAFF SOME

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:07.410 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ROMAN GROWTH ACADEMIC

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.778 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT PROGRAMS THINGS OF

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:10.813 region:rollup2
THAT NATURE THEY CAN FIND ALL OF

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:11.781 region:rollup2
THOSE ADDITIONAL. OF PROGRAMS

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:13.182 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S A THAT HAVE TO

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:14.784 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE AND.

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:15.351 region:rollup2
OF THAT AMOUNT WOULD DAYS TO

01:09:14.784 --> 01:09:17.620 region:rollup2
REFUND UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:18.888 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:20.189 region:rollup2
I DO THINKING ABOUT FUNDING FOR

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:21.791 region:rollup2
YOU SEE EITHER A FEW APPROACHES

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:23.259 region:rollup2
YOU CAN TAKE WHAT APPROACH YOU

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:24.327 region:rollup2
COULD TAKE HIS OF IT AND I THINK

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:25.461 region:rollup2
IT'S A GOOD APPROACH THE

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:27.030 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAS TAKEN IN PAST

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:28.297 region:rollup2
YEARS A SORT OF. YOU KNOW USE

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:29.699 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A SORT OF

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:30.533 region:rollup2
A STARTING POINT AND IF YOU

01:09:29.699 --> 01:09:31.734 region:rollup2
THINK OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.469 region:rollup2
AS A STARTING POINT I THINK OUR

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:34.570 region:rollup2
POINT HERE IS THAT. UNDER THE

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.872 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:37.473 region:rollup2
YOU SEE SERVE HAS A WORKLOAD

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:38.041 region:rollup2
BUDGET THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO SORT

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:39.375 region:rollup2
OF KEEP THE LIGHTS ON SEARCH

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:41.144 region:rollup2
SPEAK.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:42.612 region:rollup2
AND SO THE ONE WAY TO THINK

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:43.713 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS IS WHAT ADDITIONAL

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:44.947 region:rollup2
COST INCREASES BEYOND THE

01:09:43.713 --> 01:09:46.616 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:47.417 region:rollup2
WOULD BE LIKE TO SORT OF FIND

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:48.818 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH MORE ENROLLMENT GROWTH

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:50.353 region:rollup2
WHAT COMPENSATION INCREASES

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:51.688 region:rollup2
THINGS OF THAT NATURE. YOU CAN

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:52.889 region:rollup2
ALSO YOU DON'T HAVE TO START THE

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:54.323 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL YOU COULD

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:55.425 region:rollup2
START FROM SORT OF THE GROUND UP

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:56.793 region:rollup2
AND TOOK A LOOK AT THESE COST

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:58.528 region:rollup2
INCREASES AND SAY WHICH OF THESE

01:09:56.793 --> 01:09:59.495 region:rollup2
OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. AND HOW

01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:00.997 region:rollup2
WOULD WE LIKE TO.

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.864 region:rollup2
.

01:10:00.997 --> 01:10:03.466 region:rollup2
JULY COST AMONG THE VARIOUS

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.867 region:rollup2
FUNDS SOURCES AND IN THAT

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:06.335 region:rollup2
PRACTICE WE THINK YOU MIGHT FIND

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.703 region:rollup2
THAT SOME OF THESE. AREAS ARE OF

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:09.138 region:rollup2
HIGH PRIORITY TO YOU SOME OF

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:10.373 region:rollup2
THESE AREAS MIGHT NOT BE. FOR

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:12.175 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IN PAST YEARS WE'VE

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:13.643 region:rollup2
NOTED CONCERNS WITH THE ACADEMIC

01:10:12.175 --> 01:10:14.811 region:rollup2
EXCELLENCE PROPOSAL THAT YOU SEE

01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:16.112 region:rollup2
HAS MADE IT'S IT'S A IT'S A

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:17.980 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THEY'VE MADE FOR THE

01:10:16.112 --> 01:10:19.282 region:rollup2
PAST FEW YEARS. AND IN GENERAL

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.550 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT PROPOSAL HASN'T

01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:22.151 region:rollup2
HAD A LOT OF JUSTIFICATION A LOT

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:23.219 region:rollup2
OF BACK UP AND HOW CAMPUSES

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:25.021 region:rollup2
WOULD SPEND THE FUNDS.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.222 region:rollup2
THEY PROVIDED A FEW EXAMPLES OF

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:27.023 region:rollup2
HOW THEY MIGHT USE THOSE FUNDS

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.990 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY UP FOR THE

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:29.959 region:rollup2
CAMPUS IS TO.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:31.327 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:32.328 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED AND IT MIGHT NOT

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:33.763 region:rollup2
EXACTLY MEET YOUR PRIORITIES AND

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:35.364 region:rollup2
YOU COULD PROBABLY DOESN'T MAKE

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:36.299 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING A LITTLE MORE. A

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:37.533 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE DID SORT OF ENSURE

01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:39.669 region:rollup2
THAT ITS MEETING YOUR PRIORITIES

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:41.003 region:rollup2
FOR THE SYSTEM.

01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:42.271 region:rollup2
I'M AND AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:43.739 region:rollup2
FUNDING LEVELS WE ALSO RECOMMEND

01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:45.374 region:rollup2
THAT RATHER THAN SERVE THINK

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:46.576 region:rollup2
ABOUT WELL HOW MUCH OF THIS IS A

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:48.211 region:rollup2
FACING CHRIS HOW MUCH OF THIS IS

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:49.479 region:rollup2
A TUITION BY OUT YOU COULD THINK

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:50.713 region:rollup2
MORE AGAIN. CAREFULLY ABOUT BY

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.948 region:rollup2
COST INCREASES YOU'D LIKE TO

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:53.149 region:rollup2
SORT OF SUPPORT.

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:54.984 region:rollup2
AND THAT MIGHT PROVIDE A LITTLE

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:55.284 region:rollup2
MORE DETAILED AND MORE FOCUSED

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.152 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:58.921 region:rollup2
.

01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:59.555 region:rollup2
FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.890 region:rollup2
I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON MOMENT

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:02.592 region:rollup2
ISSUES JUST A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:04.127 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT THIS IS A TOPIC OF

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.762 region:rollup2
INTEREST TO THE LEGISLATURE. I'M

01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:07.029 region:rollup2
WE DID I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.097 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:09.966 region:rollup2
THAT THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:11.801 region:rollup2
BUDGET DID SEVEN ROMAN TARGET

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.401 region:rollup2
FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR.

01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:14.403 region:rollup2
SO THAT A MOMENT TARGET IS IN

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:16.139 region:rollup2
PLACE AN ORDER DEFINE THAT YOU

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:17.840 region:rollup2
SEE REDIRECTED SOME. FUNDS

01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:19.041 region:rollup2
WITHIN THEIR EXISTING SUPPORT

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.477 region:rollup2
BUDGET TO SUPPORT THAT GROWTH

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:22.979 region:rollup2
I'M AND YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:24.046 region:rollup2
SEVEN PER AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE

01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:25.748 region:rollup2
SEVEN PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:27.049 region:rollup2
SUMMARY OF.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:28.684 region:rollup2
WHAT FUNDS YOU SEE SPECIFICALLY

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:29.385 region:rollup2
IS HOPING TO REDIRECT TO

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:31.187 region:rollup2
INTENDING TO REDIRECT FOR A

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:32.688 region:rollup2
MOMENT GROSS?

01:11:31.187 --> 01:11:34.357 region:rollup2
I ONE VERY TECHNICAL THING JUST

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:36.092 region:rollup2
A POINT OF THE COMMITTEE EIGHT

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:37.460 region:rollup2
MILLION OF THAT COMES FROM THE.

01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:38.928 region:rollup2
OFFICE THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:41.030 region:rollup2
AND WE RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU IF

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:42.165 region:rollup2
YOU APPROVE OF THIS PLAN THAT

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.232 region:rollup2
YOU SUBTRACT THAT AMOUNT FROM

01:11:42.165 --> 01:11:44.467 region:rollup2
THE YOU CO P. LINE ITEM AND

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:46.035 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRED TO THE CAMPUSES THAT

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.602 region:rollup2
WOULD ALLOW YOU SEE THIS OUR

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:48.070 region:rollup2
SHIFT THE FUNDS BACK TO THE

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:49.605 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES.

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:51.174 region:rollup2
I DO THINKING FORWARD ABOUT YOUR

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:52.942 region:rollup2
DECISIONS REGARDING NINETEEN

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:53.776 region:rollup2
TWENTY AND AND BEYOND THAT.

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:54.944 region:rollup2
I'M WE JUST THINK THOSE

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:55.945 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS ARE WRAPPED UP IN

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:57.380 region:rollup2
SOME OF YOUR.

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:59.515 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS FOR FRESHMAN

01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:01.284 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:02.518 region:rollup2
YOU YOU HAD OF THAT PRETTY A

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:03.619 region:rollup2
DETAILED DISCUSSION ON THAT ON

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:04.921 region:rollup2
AND THE CSU HEARINGS I WANT GO

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:06.455 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT AGAIN. I WAS VERY

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:07.490 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO YOU SEE WE DO THINK

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:08.958 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE DRAWING FROM

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:10.159 region:rollup2
BEYOND THEIR THEIR SERVE MASTER

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.927 region:rollup2
PLAN PULLS.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.762 region:rollup2
I'M AND SO AGAIN A SORT OF A

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:14.030 region:rollup2
QUESTION FOR YOU OF WHETHER OR

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:15.598 region:rollup2
NOT YOU LIKE TO EXPAND

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:17.333 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY OR OR SCALE BACK

ELIGIBILITY AND THAT. WILL HAVE

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:20.369 region:rollup2
AN EFFECT ON WHAT YOU DO FOR FUN

REGARDLESS THREE DECISIONS WE DO

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:24.106 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE THE

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:25.875 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SORT OF ADOPTED FROM

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:26.842 region:rollup2
A POLICY THAT WOULD GUIDES FOR

NINETEEN BUDGET REQUEST

01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:47.230 region:rollup2

GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:50.499 region:rollup2

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:07.450 region:rollup2
A MASSIVE COMPARED TO MOST STATE

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:09.719 region:rollup2
AGENCIES WHERE THIRTY FOUR AND A

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:11.454 region:rollup2

AND.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:18.160 region:rollup2
COR FUNDS THAT WHICH ARE THE

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:26.302 region:rollup2
FUND THAT.

BUDGET AND YOU'LL SEE THOSE

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:33.075 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED ON THE LEFT HAND

01:13:31.374 --> 01:13:34.510 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THE PAGE.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:36.379 region:rollup2
COR FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY MADE UP

AND.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:50.793 region:rollup2
.

BILLION DOLLARS.

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:14.517 region:rollup2
SO ONSITE THREE YOU HAVE A

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:16.552 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REPRESENTATION OF

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:17.920 region:rollup2

YOUR AGENDA THESE ARE THE.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.058 region:rollup2
PROPOSED CHANGES IN REVENUES AND

BUT THEY DECIDED TO HOLD OFF ON

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:32.868 region:rollup2
VOTING ON IT BECAUSE IT INCLUDED

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:34.303 region:rollup2
A TUITION INCREASE AND THEY

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:37.039 region:rollup2
REQUESTED THAT WE COME BACK THAT

HUNDRED. AND THIRTY SIX MILLION

01:15:26.589 --> 01:15:29.125 region:rollup2
WHICH IS MORE THAN WHAT THE

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:30.326 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED IN HIS

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:32.061 region:rollup2

THE.

PROPOSED DANTON BUDGET BUT WE

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:42.605 region:rollup2
DO NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:43.472 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO REQUESTING OR WE ARE

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:45.274 region:rollup2
ALSO HOPING FOR A.

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:46.909 region:rollup2
.

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:48.878 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT INCREASE FOR

STAFF.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:52.715 region:rollup2
.

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:54.383 region:rollup2
UC FACULTY SALARIES ARE AT THIS

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:55.518 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.952 region:rollup2
BELOW OUR MARKET COMPARISON

01:15:55.518 --> 01:15:58.287 region:rollup2
INSTITUTES.

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:59.855 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT ACCOUNTING FOR

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:02.258 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY PERCENT.

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:03.726 region:rollup2
COST OF LIVING HIGHER COST OF

TO WHICH WE. LOSE OUR FACULTY.

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:12.168 region:rollup2
SO WE REALLY DO FEEL THAT WE

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:13.869 region:rollup2
NEED TO OFFER OUR FACULTY A PAY

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:15.871 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN OUR TO RETAIN THE

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:19.375 region:rollup2
ALSO OUR FACULTY ARE A GOOD

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:20.910 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE AS THEY

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:22.445 region:rollup2
BRING AND. JUST LAST YEAR THEY

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:24.013 region:rollup2

BILLION IN FEDERAL GRANTS TO THE

INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.752 region:rollup2
WITHOUT OUR FACULTY.

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:30.853 region:rollup2
AND THE RESEARCH THAT THEY

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:32.555 region:rollup2

BRIGHT FACULTY WHO CAN GET THOSE

01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:36.358 region:rollup2
GRANTS INTO THE STATE. THE MORE

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:38.160 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SORT OF PAYING FOR THEIR

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:39.862 region:rollup2
OWN OPERATIONS AND PROVIDING A

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.964 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BENEFITS

THROUGH THEIR RESEARCH. WHICH

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:47.570 region:rollup2
ENDS UP HELPING THE PUBLIC.

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:49.972 region:rollup2
.

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:52.007 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SO.

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:55.878 region:rollup2
THE NEXT.

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:57.780 region:rollup2

NEXT SLIDE SLIDE FOR INCLUDES

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:02.818 region:rollup2

ADDITIONAL BUDGET REQUESTS ON

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:06.388 region:rollup2
TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE

01:17:04.687 --> 01:17:08.657 region:rollup2
ARE REQUESTING A SEVENTY MILLION

INCREASES.

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:14.730 region:rollup2
US SIXTY MILLION OF THAT IS

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:16.432 region:rollup2
TUITION AND TEN MILLION THIS FOR

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:17.967 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SERVICES FREE.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:19.835 region:rollup2
I WERE ALSO REQUESTING TWENTY

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:21.670 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:23.906 region:rollup2

01:17:23.906 --> 01:17:28.210 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH ABOVE WHAT WAS

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:29.812 region:rollup2
FUNDED BY. THE STATE TEN MILLION

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:31.547 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR NEW ENROLLMENT

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:33.949 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ON

01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:36.185 region:rollup2
TOP OF THE FUNDS THAT WILL BE

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:37.419 region:rollup2
REDIRECTED. FROM. WITHIN UC'S

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:37.953 region:rollup2
BUDGET INCLUDING DATE MILLION

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:39.922 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FROM YOU CO PIECE

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:41.423 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:42.691 region:rollup2
AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:45.261 region:rollup2
FOR CRITICAL DEFERRED

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:47.630 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE PROJECTS.

01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:48.931 region:rollup2
AND SLIDE FIVE SHOWS ADDITIONAL

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:49.131 region:rollup2
CONTACTS FOR.

01:17:48.931 --> 01:17:50.733 region:rollup2
WHAT?

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:52.034 region:rollup2
?

01:17:50.733 --> 01:17:53.903 region:rollup2
HOW YOU SEE HAS BEEN FUNDED FOR

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:55.971 region:rollup2
THE LAST

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:57.706 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN YEARS OR SO? BACK IN

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:58.874 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE WE

01:17:57.706 --> 01:18:00.476 region:rollup2
RECEIVED SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:02.311 region:rollup2
ARE FUNDING FOR CAMPUSES FROM

01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:04.613 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:18:02.311 --> 01:18:06.549 region:rollup2
WITH STUDENT BEES COVERING

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:07.883 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.

01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:09.652 region:rollup2
NOW STUDENT FEES ARE COVERING

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:11.186 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR

01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:12.454 region:rollup2
CAMPUS OPERATIONS IN THE STATE

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:14.089 region:rollup2
IS CONTRIBUTING ABOUT FORTY

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.957 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:16.659 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:18:14.957 --> 01:18:18.394 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT INCREASE PROVIDED

01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:19.995 region:rollup2
BY THE GOVERNOR IT APPLIES TO

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:21.964 region:rollup2
THE FORTY PERCENT.

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:23.732 region:rollup2
OF OUR CAMPUS OPERATIONS IT

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:25.434 region:rollup2
DOESN'T APPLY THAT THE SIXTY

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:27.303 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF PAYS FOR OTHER FUNDS.

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:29.171 region:rollup2
SO IN FACT THE THREE PERCENT

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:30.906 region:rollup2
INCREASE ENDS UP BEING WAY LESS

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:32.675 region:rollup2
THAN INFLATION BECAUSE IT'S

01:18:30.906 --> 01:18:34.310 region:rollup2
ABOUT ONE POINT THREE PERCENT

01:18:32.675 --> 01:18:37.446 region:rollup2
GROWTH ON OUR ENTIRE CORPS

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:38.981 region:rollup2
BUDGET. FOR THE CAMPUS AS.

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:41.283 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY WE WERE PROPOSING A

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:42.818 region:rollup2
TUITION INCREASE TO ALSO GET.

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:44.086 region:rollup2
THE INFLATIONARY COST PAID FOR

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:45.688 region:rollup2
BY THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THE

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:47.189 region:rollup2
BUDGET COVERED.

01:18:45.688 --> 01:18:49.124 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THE

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:50.559 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WILL BUY OUT THAT.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:52.494 region:rollup2
BUT TUITION INCREASE THE

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:53.829 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE COR FUNDS PER STUDENT

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:55.564 region:rollup2
SHOWN THERE ON THE LEFT. HAVE

01:18:53.829 --> 01:18:58.033 region:rollup2
GONE DOWN.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:19:00.369 region:rollup2
WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION AND

01:18:58.033 --> 01:19:03.072 region:rollup2
ALSO BECAUSE YOU SEE HAS ADDED

01:19:00.369 --> 01:19:04.907 region:rollup2
NINETY TWO THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:06.609 region:rollup2
SINCE TWO THOUSAND.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:07.876 region:rollup2
SO THE PUMP FUNDS AVAILABLE PER

01:19:06.609 --> 01:19:10.079 region:rollup2
STUDENT HAVE GONE DOWN

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:12.114 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY. EVEN THOUGH OUR

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:13.882 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE PAYING A LOT MORE

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:15.384 region:rollup2
NOW TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:18.420 region:rollup2
THEM PREVIOUSLY.

01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:21.090 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE BARS THERE ON SHOWN

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:23.092 region:rollup2
ON THE LEFT ALSO. WE HAVE TO PAY

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:25.060 region:rollup2
FOR CERTAIN COSTS.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.261 region:rollup2
DOT.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.029 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:28.764 region:rollup2
.

01:19:27.029 --> 01:19:31.900 region:rollup2
OTHER UNIVERSITIES MIGHT NOT

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:34.536 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PAY FOR BY INCLUDING.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:36.105 region:rollup2
US CS USE SO WE ARE COVERING ON

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:37.606 region:rollup2
BOND PAYMENTS OUT OF OUR OWN

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:39.008 region:rollup2
BUDGET OUR CORE BUDGET PAYS FOR

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:41.343 region:rollup2
BOND PAYMENTS.

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:43.178 region:rollup2
ON OUR CAMPUSES UP THREE HUNDRED

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:44.813 region:rollup2
FORTY SIX MILLION ESTIMATED IN

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:46.148 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR COMING OUT OF FUN

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:49.418 region:rollup2
STUFF WOULD OTHERWISE GO THE

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:51.053 region:rollup2
STUDENTS. ARE PAYING FOR A PASS

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:52.688 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS.

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:55.090 region:rollup2
THAT DEBT WAS SHIFTED ONTO THE

01:19:52.688 --> 01:19:57.192 region:rollup2
UC BUDGET. BOKKEN I THINK TWENTY

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:59.294 region:rollup2
TEN. AND WE ARE NOW.

01:19:57.192 --> 01:20:02.064 region:rollup2
PAYING FOR THAT.

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:03.699 region:rollup2
ALSO RECOVER OUR THE PAYMENTS

01:20:02.064 --> 01:20:05.134 region:rollup2

01:20:03.699 --> 01:20:06.669 region:rollup2
OUT OF OUR.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.170 region:rollup2
OWN FUNDS COR FUNDS ARE

01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:09.772 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:10.572 region:rollup2
NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

01:20:09.772 --> 01:20:12.741 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY.

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:14.576 region:rollup2
ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION COMING

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:18.080 region:rollup2
FROM ALL OF OUR FUNDS.

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:19.815 region:rollup2
GOING INTO UC RP ANNUALLY.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.517 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE ENROLLMENT HAS

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:24.687 region:rollup2
GONE UP DURING THE SAME PERIOD

01:20:21.517 --> 01:20:26.055 region:rollup2
OF TIME.

01:20:24.687 --> 01:20:27.589 region:rollup2
SLIGHT SIX PROVIDES YOU WITH

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:29.558 region:rollup2
SOME CONTEXT ON OUR TUITION

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:31.293 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS.

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:34.229 region:rollup2

BUY OUT OF TUITION STUDENTS

01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:38.801 region:rollup2
WOULD ACTUALLY SEE A SMALL

01:20:36.899 --> 01:20:40.002 region:rollup2
DECREASE.

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:41.570 region:rollup2
IN THEIR TUITION AMOUNTS BY

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:43.238 region:rollup2
SIXTY DOLLARS ANNUALLY BECAUSE

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:45.140 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY.

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:47.176 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A CHARGE CALLED FOR A

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.444 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT CULT LIQUID I THINK THAT

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:50.679 region:rollup2
WE ARE STILL PAYING OFF FOR.

01:20:48.444 --> 01:20:52.014 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST PAYMENT ON THE

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.116 region:rollup2

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:59.088 region:rollup2
REGION'S WERE GOING TO CONTINUE

01:20:57.286 --> 01:21:00.155 region:rollup2
THE CHARGE BUT THEN PUT IT THE

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:01.623 region:rollup2
WORD INSTRUCTION.

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:03.625 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE REGION'S PROPOSAL

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:04.860 region:rollup2
FOR THE TUITION INCREASE.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:06.295 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THE

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.963 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WILL BY IT OUT SO

01:21:06.295 --> 01:21:09.565 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN PUT THOSE FUNDS TO

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:11.533 region:rollup2

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:13.135 region:rollup2
HIGHER HIGHER MORE LECTURERS AND

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:15.037 region:rollup2
FACULTY WITH THAT.

01:21:13.135 --> 01:21:16.872 region:rollup2
OUR TUITION AND STUDENT

SERVICES BE FUNDS ARE CRITICAL

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:20.442 region:rollup2
TO MEETING THE. NEEDS OF THE

SO THE LOW LET'S JUST THE BUDGET

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:47.269 region:rollup2
BILLING WHICH FOR THOSE YEARS.

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:49.037 region:rollup2
STATE AT THAT THE UC HAD TO

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:50.873 region:rollup2
ENROLL AT LEAST

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:51.407 region:rollup2

THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NEW

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:53.976 region:rollup2

THEY WANTED TO MEET THOSE.

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:03.485 region:rollup2
MEET THAT ON ENROLLMENT TARGETS

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:05.120 region:rollup2

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:07.956 region:rollup2
UP ABOUT TEN THOUSAND SIX

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:09.825 region:rollup2
HUNDRED A NEW. CALIFORNIA

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:11.927 region:rollup2
RESIDENT UNDERGRADS DURING THAT

01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:14.530 region:rollup2

INSTRUCTION FOR THOSE STUDENTS

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:22.037 region:rollup2

LECTURERS AND FACULTY AND.

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:25.707 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUPPORT STAFF. TO REALLY

SERVICE THAT.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:32.514 region:rollup2
PRIOR GENERATIONS IN PRIOR YEARS

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:33.882 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS HAD AT UC.

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:36.718 region:rollup2
WHEN MOVING ON IN THE

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:39.555 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION TO SLIDE EIGHT.

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:40.522 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT OF NOT HAVING

01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:42.191 region:rollup2
MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:44.760 region:rollup2
COVERED.

01:22:42.191 --> 01:22:46.428 region:rollup2
FULLY AND THE IMPACT OF HAVING

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.164 region:rollup2
THE UC CUT.

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:50.365 region:rollup2
BY ONE BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:51.767 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHT TO TWENTY ELEVEN

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:53.602 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THAT. FUNDING HAS

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:55.103 region:rollup2
NOW BEEN RESTORED WE'RE ABOUT AT

01:22:53.602 --> 01:22:56.805 region:rollup2
THE SAME LEVEL OF FUNDING AS WE

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:58.173 region:rollup2
WERE THEN. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY AT

01:22:56.805 --> 01:23:01.243 region:rollup2
THE SAME LEVEL OF STATE FUNDING

01:22:58.173 --> 01:23:02.778 region:rollup2
US WE WERE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND.

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:04.213 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT IS THAT STUDENT

01:23:02.778 --> 01:23:06.114 region:rollup2
SATISFACTION

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:07.816 region:rollup2
APPEARS TO BE DECLINING MORE

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:09.017 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.652 region:rollup2
NOT CERTAIN IF THEY WOULD COME

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:13.222 region:rollup2
TO THE UC AGAIN AND IT WASN'T

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:14.523 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE. BUT THEY

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:16.725 region:rollup2
WERE TOLD THAT IT WOULD BE BY.

01:23:14.523 --> 01:23:17.860 region:rollup2
THEIR PARENTS ARE.

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:20.128 region:rollup2
OF FAMILY FRIENDS WHO WENT

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:22.698 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEM.

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:24.466 region:rollup2
AND SHOT QUITE.

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:26.401 region:rollup2
DISTRESSINGLY BETWEEN TWO

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:28.337 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIX AND TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.937 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO SAID

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:31.306 region:rollup2
THEY COULD NOT GET INTO THEIR

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:33.442 region:rollup2
MAJOR. WENT UP FROM THREE

01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:35.210 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO THIRTEEN PERCENT.

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:36.445 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE THE FACULTY ONLY

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:38.313 region:rollup2
CERTAIN NUMBER STUDENTS CAN GET

01:23:36.445 --> 01:23:40.182 region:rollup2
INTO A MAJOR IF THE FACULTY

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:40.716 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T BEEN HIRED.

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:42.885 region:rollup2
AND.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:44.019 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN MAJORS WHERE

01:23:42.885 --> 01:23:45.320 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WANT TO GO BECAUSE THEY

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:47.055 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT'S.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:50.092 region:rollup2
THAT WILL LEAD TO A WELL PAYING

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:51.994 region:rollup2
JOB AFTER THEY GRADUATE OR IT'S

01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:53.128 region:rollup2
THEIR PERSONAL INTEREST.

01:23:51.994 --> 01:23:55.430 region:rollup2
AND THEY REALLY WANT TO STUDY

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:56.965 region:rollup2
THAT SUBJECT AREA BUT THEY FIND

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.1000 region:rollup2
THAT THEY GET INTO YOU SEE. AND

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:59.401 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE MAJOR

01:23:57.1000 --> 01:24:01.403 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:03.105 region:rollup2
A VERY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:04.306 region:rollup2
ALSO MORE STUDENTS ARE FINDING

01:24:03.105 --> 01:24:05.107 region:rollup2
THAT THEY FEEL LESS CONNECTED

01:24:04.306 --> 01:24:06.708 region:rollup2
THE FACULTY.

01:24:05.107 --> 01:24:08.477 region:rollup2
WHO ARE?

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:10.178 region:rollup2
TEACHING THEM BECAUSE THOSE

01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:11.847 region:rollup2
CLASSES ARE SO MUCH LARGER

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:13.248 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF BEING IN A CLASS WITH

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:15.050 region:rollup2
FORTY STUDENTS OR SIXTY STUDENTS

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:16.818 region:rollup2
LEARN A CLASS WITH HUNDRED AND

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:18.086 region:rollup2
FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS.

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:19.555 region:rollup2
AND THEY DON'T GET ANY FACE TO

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:21.223 region:rollup2
FACE TIME PERSONALLY WITH THE

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:23.025 region:rollup2
FACULTY MEMBER.

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:23.725 region:rollup2
THEY FEEL LESS CONNECTED TO THE.

01:24:23.025 --> 01:24:25.794 region:rollup2
TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:27.563 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTING THEM.

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:29.665 region:rollup2
AND ALSO ON SLIDE NINE.

01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:29.865 region:rollup2
WHILE WE'RE EXTREMELY HAPPY

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:31.333 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:32.901 region:rollup2
.

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:34.970 region:rollup2
ARE YOU OUR M. STUDENTS HAVE

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:36.171 region:rollup2

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:37.973 region:rollup2
TWO PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:39.408 region:rollup2
EIGHT TO ABOUT.

01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:40.776 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE PERCENT AND TWENTY

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:43.211 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:45.213 region:rollup2

YEAR GRADUATION RATE AND TWENTY

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:25.340 region:rollup2
TWO TWELVE WAS HIGHER THAN TWO

THOUSAND NINE SO THE OVERALL

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:28.844 region:rollup2
RATE HAS BEEN GOING UP. BUT WE

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:32.814 region:rollup2
DID SEE A SLIGHT DROP IN THE

01:27:28.844 --> 01:27:35.250 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR GRADUATION RATE.

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:37.753 region:rollup2

AYE IT'S RELATED TO.

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:19.501 region:rollup2
YOUR CHART ON PAGE SEVEN BUT THE

01:32:17.766 --> 01:32:21.403 region:rollup2
NINETY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS DID

ACTUALLY.

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:47.695 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE CERT THIS.

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:49.731 region:rollup2
CHART IS ACTUALLY FOR

.

01:32:56.004 --> 01:33:01.309 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:02.544 region:rollup2
AND ROAMING GROWTH.

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:06.581 region:rollup2
GOT BEING THE NUMBER ONE COST

01:33:02.544 --> 01:33:10.118 region:rollup2
DRIVER FOR THE INCREASING.

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:13.922 region:rollup2
BAR GRAPHS.

01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:14.389 region:rollup2
AT IT AT LEAST AND THEN IT IS IS

01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:14.856 region:rollup2
NOT FAIR TO SAY THAT.

01:33:14.389 --> 01:33:16.091 region:rollup2
.

01:33:14.856 --> 01:33:16.724 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:20.428 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY INCREASING TUITION

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:22.697 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:24.099 region:rollup2
AND SIGNIFICANT PART COVERED

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:26.534 region:rollup2
THOSE THEN ROAMING GROWTH GIVEN

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:27.068 region:rollup2
THAT THIS ALSO INCLUDES ADDED

FOSTER.

01:33:29.938 --> 01:33:32.507 region:rollup2
OF THAT'S CORRECT REVIEWS

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:34.075 region:rollup2
TUITION INCREASES AND WE'VE

01:33:32.507 --> 01:33:35.543 region:rollup2
ADDED NONRESIDENT STUDENTS TO

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:38.179 region:rollup2
HELP COVER THE UNIVERSITIES

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:40.114 region:rollup2
INCREASING COSTS.

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:41.249 region:rollup2
THE GOLDEN BAR THERE THAT STATES

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:43.618 region:rollup2
YOU SEE GENERAL FUNDS THIS IS ON

01:33:41.249 --> 01:33:46.087 region:rollup2
SLIDE FIVE. ON THE LEFT THERE

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:48.590 region:rollup2
THE UC GENERAL FUNDS IS OUR NON

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:49.924 region:rollup2
RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION.

01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:51.059 region:rollup2
AND A FEW VERY SMALL.

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:52.894 region:rollup2
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES LIKE

01:33:51.059 --> 01:33:54.896 region:rollup2
PATENT REVENUE BUT THERE'S A

01:33:52.894 --> 01:33:55.964 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS OF NON RESIDENT

01:33:54.896 --> 01:33:58.500 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION DARKENED

01:33:55.964 --> 01:34:01.035 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:02.704 region:rollup2
AND SO WE USE THAT WE ENROLLED

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:04.239 region:rollup2
THOSE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS.

01:34:02.704 --> 01:34:05.773 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL

01:34:04.239 --> 01:34:08.142 region:rollup2
FUNDING FROM THEM TO HELP

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:10.011 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OUR RESIDENTS STUDENTS.

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:11.846 region:rollup2
IF THEY PAY MORE THAN YES SIR

01:34:10.011 --> 01:34:13.248 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN EDUCATION

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:15.083 region:rollup2
OKAY. AND THEN.

01:34:13.248 --> 01:34:17.018 region:rollup2
.

01:34:15.083 --> 01:34:18.486 region:rollup2
SWITCHING BACK TO THE GRAPH ON

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:21.155 region:rollup2
PAGE SEVEN SO.

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:23.024 region:rollup2
THE.

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:24.259 region:rollup2
CAPS IS ADDING SEVEN THOUSAND

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:25.627 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED FULL TIME

01:34:24.259 --> 01:34:26.594 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT CALIFORNIA

01:34:25.627 --> 01:34:28.429 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATES AT AND THIS IS

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:31.266 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:33.701 region:rollup2
FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO.

01:34:31.266 --> 01:34:37.338 region:rollup2
WHAT YEAR?

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:40.875 region:rollup2
OF TWENTY FIFTEEN TO FALL.

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:43.244 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN OKAY.

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:44.479 region:rollup2
AND A JUDGE AT LEAST SAID THEY.

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:46.481 region:rollup2
I KNOW CHARTS CAN BE DECEIVING

01:34:44.479 --> 01:34:48.449 region:rollup2
BUT THIS THIS DOES SEEM TO BE A

01:34:46.481 --> 01:34:49.050 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND.

01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:50.785 region:rollup2
AND.

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:53.655 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:54.055 region:rollup2
STUDENT ENROLLMENT IS THAT ALL

01:34:53.655 --> 01:34:56.024 region:rollup2
YET SAY BATTED.

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:57.425 region:rollup2
SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN TO NOW

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:59.460 region:rollup2
WE'VE ADDED. TEN THOUSAND SIX

01:34:57.425 --> 01:35:00.528 region:rollup2
HUNDRED CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.262 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.964 region:rollup2
AND.

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:05.533 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE

01:35:02.964 --> 01:35:08.736 region:rollup2
BUDGETS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:09.037 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN.

01:35:08.736 --> 01:35:11.172 region:rollup2
IT'S WITH.

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:12.373 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE AGREED

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:14.442 region:rollup2
UPON MARGINAL.

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:17.278 region:rollup2
STATE COST FOR THOSE STUDENTS.

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:18.046 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE ENROLLED THE FIVE

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:20.014 region:rollup2
THOUSAND NEW.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:21.216 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADS AND

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:24.152 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN OR FOR FALL

01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:26.688 region:rollup2
FIFTH SIXTEEN BECAUSE WE ALWAYS.

01:35:24.152 --> 01:35:27.589 region:rollup2
ARE IN ACTUAL INVOLVEMENT IN

01:35:26.688 --> 01:35:28.523 region:rollup2
ROLLING OFF THE STUDENTS AT BY

01:35:27.589 --> 01:35:29.924 region:rollup2
YEAR BEHIND FROM WHEN WE GET THE

01:35:28.523 --> 01:35:30.992 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:31.426 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT

01:35:30.992 --> 01:35:32.594 region:rollup2
GETTING THE FUNDS.

01:35:31.426 --> 01:35:34.929 region:rollup2
IT WAS ABOUT A HALF THE

01:35:32.594 --> 01:35:36.197 region:rollup2
MARGINAL COST.

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:37.732 region:rollup2
IT'S THE USUAL STATE CHAIR SO WE

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:39.234 region:rollup2
GOT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

01:35:37.732 --> 01:35:40.802 region:rollup2
STUDENT INSTEAD OF TEN THOUSAND

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:43.071 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER STUDENT. OUR

01:35:40.802 --> 01:35:44.172 region:rollup2
CALCULATED COSTS FOR EDUCATING

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:45.873 region:rollup2
AN UNDERGRADUATE IS ABOUT

01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:47.342 region:rollup2
NINETEEN THOUSAND A YEAR. OF

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:48.876 region:rollup2
WHICH NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:35:47.342 --> 01:35:50.278 region:rollup2
COMES FROM STUDENT FEES AND THEN

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:53.348 region:rollup2
THE TEN THOUSAND COMES.

01:35:50.278 --> 01:35:56.484 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY FROM THE STATE.

01:35:53.348 --> 01:35:57.619 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:57.819 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH YOU CHAIR THAT.

01:35:57.619 --> 01:35:59.387 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:35:57.819 --> 01:36:01.923 region:rollup2
.

01:35:59.387 --> 01:36:02.824 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:03.758 region:rollup2
WE HEAR FROM OUR CONSISTENT WAY

01:36:02.824 --> 01:36:05.493 region:rollup2
OF JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF FOR

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:07.061 region:rollup2
MY CONSTITUENTS IT IS YOU KNOW

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:08.262 region:rollup2
WHY IT IS SO MUCH HARDER FOR MY

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:10.431 region:rollup2
KID TO GET INTO THE UNIVERSITY

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:11.866 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA NOW. THEN WHEN

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:15.737 region:rollup2
THEIR PARENTS WENT.

01:36:11.866 --> 01:36:18.072 region:rollup2
EN AND WHICH IS WHY YOU KNOW I.

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:20.074 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THAT TO

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:22.710 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES IS THE

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:23.311 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT ACCESS.

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:25.013 region:rollup2
VERY.

01:36:23.311 --> 01:36:27.115 region:rollup2
I I'M I'M HEARING.

01:36:25.013 --> 01:36:30.151 region:rollup2
MORE MORE FROM THE CURRENTLY

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:30.351 region:rollup2
ENROLLED THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

01:36:30.151 --> 01:36:32.987 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:34.856 region:rollup2
THE THE THE OVERCROWDING NATURE

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:36.991 region:rollup2
OF OF THE CAMPUSES AND SO I I'D

01:36:34.856 --> 01:36:39.027 region:rollup2
LIKE TO ACTUALLY TURN TO THE LA

01:36:36.991 --> 01:36:39.861 region:rollup2
JOH. NA I BELIEVE YOU HAD A

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:42.230 region:rollup2
STUDY.

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:43.598 region:rollup2
MAYBE ONE OR TWO YEARS AGO WERE

01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:44.599 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU FELT THAT WAY. I

01:36:43.598 --> 01:36:46.768 region:rollup2
BELIEVE ONE OF YOUR CONCLUSIONS

01:36:44.599 --> 01:36:49.837 region:rollup2
WITH WAS THAT THE. UNIVERSITY OF

01:36:46.768 --> 01:36:53.207 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES ACTUALLY HAD

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:55.276 region:rollup2
ENOUGH CAPACITY TO ADMIT MORE.

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:57.612 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IT IS IS

01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:58.880 region:rollup2
THAT STILL YOUR OPINION.

01:36:57.612 --> 01:37:00.682 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WHAT THAT STUDY DID IS

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.082 region:rollup2
IT WAS TRYING TO ANSWER WHETHER

01:37:00.682 --> 01:37:03.751 region:rollup2
OR NOT.

01:37:01.082 --> 01:37:05.186 region:rollup2
AND A NEW CAMPUS EITHER IT USE

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:06.320 region:rollup2
YOUR SEARS HE WAS JUSTIFIED.

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:07.288 region:rollup2
AND THE GAUGE THAT WE LOOK AT

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.856 region:rollup2
BOTH AT THE EXISTING CAPACITY AS

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:09.757 region:rollup2
WELL AS.

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:11.225 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT IF THEY WERE TO

01:37:09.757 --> 01:37:12.660 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THOSE

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:14.128 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES BASED ON THEIR SORT OF

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.363 region:rollup2
LONG RANGE PLANS AND WE FOUND

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:16.764 region:rollup2
BASED ON THAT AND YOU CAMPUS

01:37:15.363 --> 01:37:17.799 region:rollup2
WASN'T JUSTIFIED BUT NOT JUST

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:19.200 region:rollup2
WAS NOT JUSTIFIED IN TERMS OF

01:37:17.799 --> 01:37:20.168 region:rollup2
EXISTING SPACE WE DO THINK

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.803 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME EXISTING SPACE

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:24.005 region:rollup2
THERE. ON A SEVERAL THE CAMPUSES

01:37:21.803 --> 01:37:25.707 region:rollup2
HOW ARE HAVE SOMEWHAT LOWER USE

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:26.341 region:rollup2
AND THE FALL THROUGH SPRING.

01:37:25.707 --> 01:37:28.142 region:rollup2
AND THEIR LITTLE CAMPUSES ARE

01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:29.711 region:rollup2
ALSO THERE ABOUT ABOUT.

01:37:28.142 --> 01:37:31.412 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR THEIR SUMMER USES

01:37:29.711 --> 01:37:31.979 region:rollup2
BELOW KIND OF EXPECTATIONS THAT

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:32.880 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS CERTAIN

01:37:31.979 --> 01:37:34.916 region:rollup2
PLACE

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.250 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S ALSO OF CAPACITY TO

01:37:34.916 --> 01:37:37.418 region:rollup2
ADD IN THE SUMMER TOO SO THERE'S

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:38.820 region:rollup2
SOME SOME WE DO THINK I HAVE

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:40.555 region:rollup2
SOME EXISTING SPACE. THAT MORE

01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:42.423 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HOW DO YOU RECONCILE

01:37:40.555 --> 01:37:44.325 region:rollup2
THAT WITH YOU PERHAPS ANECDOTAL

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:47.161 region:rollup2
LA TESTIMONY THEY'VE HEARD FROM

01:37:44.325 --> 01:37:47.528 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ABOUT. HOW THEY THAT

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:48.663 region:rollup2
THEY FEEL THAT?

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:50.264 region:rollup2
DID.%

01:37:48.663 --> 01:37:52.467 region:rollup2
THE CAMPS IS NOW ARE ARE READY

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:54.369 region:rollup2
OVER ENROLLED IN AN OVER ENACTED

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:55.770 region:rollup2
YET IT'S HARD TO GAUGE THE THE

01:37:54.369 --> 01:37:58.005 region:rollup2
DATA WE SEE WITH.

01:37:55.770 --> 01:37:58.172 region:rollup2
ANECDOTAL EXAMPLES WE I THINK

01:37:58.005 --> 01:37:59.607 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:37:58.172 --> 01:38:01.209 region:rollup2
.

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:01.743 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION THAT WE THAT WE'VE

01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:03.578 region:rollup2
HEARD IS THAT.

01:38:01.743 --> 01:38:05.613 region:rollup2
.

01:38:03.578 --> 01:38:09.317 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES CAMPUSES ARE.

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:09.317 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW VERY BUSY AT PEAK

01:38:09.383 --> 01:38:13.054 region:rollup2
TUESDAY AND THURSDAY YOU AND IN

01:38:11.686 --> 01:38:15.923 region:rollup2
THE AFTERNOON. OR THEY MAY HAVE

01:38:13.054 --> 01:38:16.557 region:rollup2
LESS USED FOR EXAMPLE ON FRIDAYS

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:17.091 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT HAVE LESS USE IN THE

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:19.460 region:rollup2
SUMMER SO THAT SO I THINK

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:21.829 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:22.830 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT POTENTIALLY COULD

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:24.232 region:rollup2
BE GOING ON THERE WHEN WHEN WE

01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:26.134 region:rollup2
CERVANTES ANECDOTES OF

01:38:24.232 --> 01:38:26.868 region:rollup2
OVERCROWDING AND ON AND IT'S

01:38:26.134 --> 01:38:27.702 region:rollup2
ALSO IT'S ALSO I'M WITHIN

01:38:26.868 --> 01:38:29.337 region:rollup2
CERTAIN COURSES TO THERE MIGHT

01:38:27.702 --> 01:38:31.072 region:rollup2
BE CERTAIN VERY VERY HIGH DEMAND

01:38:29.337 --> 01:38:32.073 region:rollup2
COURSES WHERE. THERE IT'S HARD

01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:32.640 region:rollup2
TO GET INTO THERE MIGHT BE OTHER

01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:34.375 region:rollup2
COURSES WHERE THERE'S LESS

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.009 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT DEMAND SO THAT THAT

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:36.344 region:rollup2
COULD BE ANOTHER ELEMENT THERE

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:38.546 region:rollup2
TO. WHAT IS A UNIVERSITY

01:38:36.344 --> 01:38:39.781 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S POSITION AS TO

01:38:38.546 --> 01:38:40.915 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU HAVE?

01:38:39.781 --> 01:38:42.083 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO TO ADD

01:38:40.915 --> 01:38:43.785 region:rollup2
FURTHER.

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:45.653 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH

01:38:43.785 --> 01:38:47.789 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SIR FOR GIVING ME THE

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:50.191 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. UP WE

01:38:47.789 --> 01:38:51.826 region:rollup2
HAVE LIMITED CAPACITY FOR NEW

01:38:50.191 --> 01:38:52.326 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:38:51.826 --> 01:38:54.595 region:rollup2
TWO CAMPUSES THAT HAVE.

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:56.264 region:rollup2
.

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:58.866 region:rollup2
UNUSED CLASSROOM SPACE THERE ARE

01:38:56.264 --> 01:39:00.935 region:rollup2
BERKELEY AND LOS ANGELES WHERE

01:38:58.866 --> 01:39:02.637 region:rollup2
THESE CLASSROOMS AREN'T VERY OLD

01:39:00.935 --> 01:39:04.105 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS AND ACTUALLY SEAT

01:39:02.637 --> 01:39:06.207 region:rollup2
FEWER THAN FIFTEEN STUDENTS.

01:39:04.105 --> 01:39:08.476 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NO LONGER PRACTICAL FOR

01:39:06.207 --> 01:39:10.645 region:rollup2
THE MODERN UNIVERSITY. WHERE WE

01:39:08.476 --> 01:39:11.813 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE FORTY FIFTY TWO

01:39:10.645 --> 01:39:13.147 region:rollup2
HUNDRED STUDENTS IN A SINGLE

01:39:11.813 --> 01:39:15.082 region:rollup2
CLASS?

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:17.285 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO RUN A

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:18.719 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN STUDENT.

01:39:17.285 --> 01:39:20.755 region:rollup2
COURSE WE KNOW TO DEVOTE A

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:22.657 region:rollup2
FACULTY MEMBER TO THAT SORT WE

01:39:20.755 --> 01:39:24.759 region:rollup2
REALLY NEED ON THOSE CAMPUSES

01:39:22.657 --> 01:39:26.227 region:rollup2
FUNDS TO. UP RENOVATE THE INSIDE

01:39:24.759 --> 01:39:28.463 region:rollup2
OF THOSE BUILDINGS WITH LARGER

01:39:26.227 --> 01:39:30.231 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM SPACE SO JUST LOOKING

01:39:28.463 --> 01:39:32.300 region:rollup2
AT SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT'S GOING

01:39:30.231 --> 01:39:34.402 region:rollup2
ON USED ON TWO CAMPUSES IS NOT

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:35.703 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT. UP I WOULD NOTE THAT

01:39:34.402 --> 01:39:37.305 region:rollup2
THE OTHER CAMPUSES ARE IT OUGHT

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:38.806 region:rollup2
NINETY PERCENT OR ABOVE A

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:39.273 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT SPACE

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:41.142 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION FOR THEIR

01:39:39.273 --> 01:39:42.610 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS.

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:44.679 region:rollup2
THE SPACE UTILIZATION BEING

01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:46.581 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY

01:39:44.679 --> 01:39:48.382 region:rollup2
EIGHT AM THREE FIVE PM SO

01:39:46.581 --> 01:39:49.784 region:rollup2
THEY'RE RUNNING CLASSES. IN THE

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:52.186 region:rollup2
EVENINGS SOME ARE OFFERING NOW

01:39:49.784 --> 01:39:53.087 region:rollup2
THEM ON WEEKENDS.

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:54.355 region:rollup2
.

01:39:53.087 --> 01:39:56.657 region:rollup2
WE ARE TRYING TO INCREASE SUMMER

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:59.227 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT TO TAKE SOME PRESSURE

01:39:56.657 --> 01:40:02.463 region:rollup2
OFF OF THE FALL AND SPRING.

01:39:59.227 --> 01:40:04.265 region:rollup2
WE FIND STUDENTS VERY RESISTANT

01:40:02.463 --> 01:40:05.466 region:rollup2
TO ENROLL IN SUMMER AND THIS

01:40:04.265 --> 01:40:07.668 region:rollup2
COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE FEDERAL

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:09.170 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID UP UNTIL THIS LAST

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:11.172 region:rollup2
SUMMER AS NOT AVAILABLE.

01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:12.240 region:rollup2
SERVICE ENDED FOR AWHILE AND IT

01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:13.574 region:rollup2
AND CAL GRANTS ARE.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.643 region:rollup2
.

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:17.345 region:rollup2
A STUDENT CAN CHOOSE

01:40:15.643 --> 01:40:19.247 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER TERM OR WHICH TERMS

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:20.815 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE YEAR TO USE CALTRANS

01:40:19.247 --> 01:40:23.618 region:rollup2
FOR. MOST CHOOSE TO USE THEIR

01:40:20.815 --> 01:40:24.452 region:rollup2
CALDERON IN FALL AND SPRING. UP

01:40:23.618 --> 01:40:26.153 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THEY USE THEM IN THE

01:40:24.452 --> 01:40:28.356 region:rollup2
SUMMER AND THEY'RE EITHER NOT

01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:30.124 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE IN THE FALL OR SPRING

01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:31.559 region:rollup2
SO. SOMETHING FOR THE

01:40:30.124 --> 01:40:32.994 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE PERHAPS TO EXAMINE

01:40:31.559 --> 01:40:35.162 region:rollup2
ON WHETHER OR NOT CAL GRANTS

01:40:32.994 --> 01:40:36.898 region:rollup2
COULD ALSO BE UTILIZED BY

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:38.232 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN SUMMER.

01:40:36.898 --> 01:40:39.834 region:rollup2
BUT SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:41.435 region:rollup2
PILOT PROJECTS TO TRY AND

01:40:39.834 --> 01:40:43.404 region:rollup2
INCREASE SUMMER ENROLLMENT AND

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:45.406 region:rollup2
IN FACT SAN DIEGO OFFERED FREE

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:47.208 region:rollup2
HOUSING FOR STUDENTS AND THEY

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:49.210 region:rollup2
STILL DIDN'T GET TAKERS.

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:52.013 region:rollup2
SO QUITE RADICAL.

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:53.714 region:rollup2
WHO HAD KNOWS THAT THE STEPS

01:40:52.013 --> 01:40:55.416 region:rollup2
CAMPUS OF TRYING TO GO TO? TO

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:57.218 region:rollup2
GET STUDENTS TO ENROLL IN SUMMER

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:58.486 region:rollup2
BUT ON THEIR NOT REALLY GETTING

01:40:57.218 --> 01:41:00.988 region:rollup2
TAKERS FOR THAT.

01:40:58.486 --> 01:41:03.457 region:rollup2
pALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:04.659 region:rollup2
OKAY I KNOW THAT SOMEONE MEMBER

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:06.527 region:rollup2
LIMON HAS A HAS A QUESTION IS

01:41:04.659 --> 01:41:07.962 region:rollup2
WHEN INTERJECT ON TO THINGS THAT

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:10.164 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED MR MARTZ

01:41:07.962 --> 01:41:11.332 region:rollup2
ITCHY. SO THE FIRST IS THAT I I

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:12.767 region:rollup2
CONCUR THAT THE STATE HASN'T

01:41:11.332 --> 01:41:13.868 region:rollup2
STEPPED UP AND FUNDING THE THE

01:41:12.767 --> 01:41:15.970 region:rollup2
YOU SEE.

01:41:13.868 --> 01:41:19.140 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST DECADE IN.

01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:20.408 region:rollup2
A LOT WAS TO THE RECESSION WAS

01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:22.577 region:rollup2
AND IS HER HIDING HER.

01:41:20.408 --> 01:41:23.144 region:rollup2
MALICE EVEN BEFORE WE WERE HERE.

01:41:22.577 --> 01:41:23.444 region:rollup2
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:41:23.144 --> 01:41:24.745 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT.

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:26.814 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S ANOTHER BILLION

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:28.015 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT WE PUT INTO THE UC

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:29.517 region:rollup2
FROM THE GENERAL FUND THROUGH

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:31.385 region:rollup2
OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAM SO WHILE

01:41:29.517 --> 01:41:32.219 region:rollup2
TUITION HAS GONE UP.

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:33.688 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUSLY THOUGHT ALL

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:35.723 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THAT ARE PAYING THAT

01:41:33.688 --> 01:41:37.058 region:rollup2
FAMILIES ARE. BUT FOR MANY

01:41:35.723 --> 01:41:39.026 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IT'S THE STATE OF

01:41:37.058 --> 01:41:41.195 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WRITING A CHECK BE

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:43.331 region:rollup2
OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAM SO. IT'S

01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:44.865 region:rollup2
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE.

01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:46.767 region:rollup2
IF TO THE UC EVERY YEAR THROUGH

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:48.202 region:rollup2
THE STUDENT COMMISSION.

01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:49.837 region:rollup2
AND THEN ON THE ON THE IN

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:52.006 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT ISSUE I I YOU KNOW

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:53.074 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE YOU SAID.

01:41:52.006 --> 01:41:54.542 region:rollup2
I MISTER MURATSUCHI THIS IS AT

THE CHANCELLOR'S AND AND THEY

01:41:56.077 --> 01:41:59.847 region:rollup2
HAVE FRANKLY GIVE A LITTLE BIT

01:41:58.179 --> 01:42:01.015 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POSITION THAN YOU.

01:41:59.847 --> 01:42:02.850 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SAYING THAT THERE IS

01:42:01.015 --> 01:42:04.285 region:rollup2
CAPACITY WE HAVE TALKING TO THE

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:05.252 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT AND YOUR TEAM OVER THE

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:06.587 region:rollup2
YEARS AND AND AND YOU HAVE

01:42:05.252 --> 01:42:08.456 region:rollup2
ALLUDED TO THAT THERE IS

01:42:06.587 --> 01:42:10.458 region:rollup2
CAPACITY TO GROW. BY A FEW

01:42:08.456 --> 01:42:11.025 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STUDENTS PER YEAR

01:42:10.458 --> 01:42:13.628 region:rollup2
GRANTED WE ALSO HEAR THAT.

01:42:11.025 --> 01:42:15.129 region:rollup2
CURRENT.

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:17.231 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ON CAMPUS WOULD LIKE TO

01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:17.698 region:rollup2
HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO FOCUS

01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:21.068 region:rollup2
ON THE.

01:42:17.698 --> 01:42:22.870 region:rollup2
CLASS RATIOS AND AND OTHER ON

01:42:21.068 --> 01:42:24.772 region:rollup2
CAMPUS ON.

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:26.207 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS BUT I DON'T THINK

01:42:24.772 --> 01:42:27.942 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS ARE MUTUALLY

01:42:26.207 --> 01:42:29.377 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVE AND THAT IT'S

01:42:27.942 --> 01:42:31.312 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE GOING TO

01:42:29.377 --> 01:42:32.813 region:rollup2
CONTINUE. TO TO PRESS ON.

01:42:31.312 --> 01:42:33.948 region:rollup2
.

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:36.384 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WITH SOME OF THE

01:42:33.948 --> 01:42:38.886 region:rollup2
CAMPUS AS YOU NOTED.

01:42:36.384 --> 01:42:40.187 region:rollup2
MERCED AND RIVERSIDE BUT ALSO

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:40.988 region:rollup2
SET UP SOME OF THE OTHERS SAN

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:42.456 region:rollup2
DIEGO AND.

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:44.125 region:rollup2
DAVIS WE KNOW THAT THERE THERE

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:45.493 region:rollup2
IS CAPACITY TO GROW AND AND I'M

01:42:44.125 --> 01:42:46.560 region:rollup2
LEAVING OUT A FEW OTHER SWELL

01:42:45.493 --> 01:42:48.229 region:rollup2
AND I WILL COME BACK WITH SOME

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:49.930 region:rollup2
OTHER ISSUES BUT AS

01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:52.099 region:rollup2
SOMEONE I REALLY MUST.

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:54.402 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND. AND AND AS

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:56.437 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO WORKED THERE.

01:42:54.402 --> 01:42:58.105 region:rollup2
SPACE IS ALWAYS COVERED AND AND

01:42:56.437 --> 01:42:59.373 region:rollup2
I MEAN EVERYONE WAS USING

01:42:58.105 --> 01:43:01.575 region:rollup2
STEPPED LOUNGES.

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:05.046 region:rollup2
EXTRA ROOMS AND LIBRARIES TO

01:43:01.575 --> 01:43:06.380 region:rollup2
HOST A CLASSROOM SO I.

01:43:05.046 --> 01:43:08.115 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT'S CHANGED A LOT

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:09.550 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET.

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:09.917 region:rollup2
A CLASSROOM IF YOU'RE NOT A

01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:11.852 region:rollup2
REGULAR CLASS.

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:13.854 region:rollup2
.

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:15.556 region:rollup2
THAT MEETS ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:18.292 region:rollup2
YOU NEED IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:20.261 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION ACTUALLY HAS TO DO

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:22.697 region:rollup2
WITH HURT NUMBER SIX.

01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:25.766 region:rollup2
OKAY ON PAGE SIX I.

01:43:22.697 --> 01:43:27.835 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHARTER

01:43:25.766 --> 01:43:29.336 region:rollup2
YOU COULD IMMEDIATELY SEE THAT

01:43:27.835 --> 01:43:31.072 region:rollup2
THERE WERE TWO THREE. YEAR

01:43:29.336 --> 01:43:31.706 region:rollup2
PERIODS

01:43:31.072 --> 01:43:34.008 region:rollup2
WHERE.

01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:35.843 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE IN TUITION WENT UP.

01:43:34.008 --> 01:43:38.345 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:43:35.843 --> 01:43:40.181 region:rollup2
I'M MUCH MORE SO THAN ALL THE

01:43:38.345 --> 01:43:42.783 region:rollup2
OTHER YEARS ADDED UP.

01:43:40.181 --> 01:43:44.718 region:rollup2
AND THOSE THREE PERIODS ALSO

01:43:42.783 --> 01:43:46.854 region:rollup2
COINCIDED WITH ROUGH SPOTS IN

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:48.189 region:rollup2
OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. AND THEY

01:43:46.854 --> 01:43:50.124 region:rollup2
COINCIDED WITH KEY TWELVE SEEN

01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:52.093 region:rollup2
MAJOR CUTS.

01:43:50.124 --> 01:43:54.662 region:rollup2
AND I AS YOU LOOK AT THIS YOU

01:43:52.093 --> 01:43:56.363 region:rollup2
CAN ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT.

01:43:54.662 --> 01:43:58.265 region:rollup2
WE AS A STATE WILL HIT THOSE

01:43:56.363 --> 01:44:00.468 region:rollup2
ROUGH PATCHES AS WELL SO IN

01:43:58.265 --> 01:44:02.269 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT

01:44:00.468 --> 01:44:04.138 region:rollup2
THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS ARE. HOW

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:06.006 region:rollup2
DOES THE YOU SEE PLAN OR THINK

01:44:04.138 --> 01:44:07.508 region:rollup2
ABOUT ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:08.776 region:rollup2
REALLY ROUGH PATCHES BECAUSE IF

01:44:07.508 --> 01:44:09.910 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT?

01:44:08.776 --> 01:44:12.179 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TO TWO

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:13.581 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIVE AND TWO DOZEN

01:44:12.179 --> 01:44:16.016 region:rollup2
NINETY DOESN'T SOLVE.

01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:17.551 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT THE BOOK OF WHEN IT

01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:18.886 region:rollup2
HAD THESE TUITION INCREASES IT

01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:20.421 region:rollup2
WENT UP

01:44:18.886 --> 01:44:21.889 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE PREPARE FOR THE NEXT

01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:24.158 region:rollup2
TIME THIS

01:44:21.889 --> 01:44:26.060 region:rollup2
HAPPENS ON WILL WE ALSO EXPECT

01:44:24.158 --> 01:44:28.195 region:rollup2
TO SEE.

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:29.897 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE AYE GO UP WITH AND

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:32.099 region:rollup2
THAT DRAMATICALLY A EVERYTHING

01:44:29.897 --> 01:44:33.834 region:rollup2
ELSE IS A FEW DIGITS HERE AND

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:37.004 region:rollup2
THERE BUT THEN YOU SEE TWELVE.

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:37.805 region:rollup2
A THIRTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIX

01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:41.408 region:rollup2
PERCENT THAT'S I MEAN THAT THE

01:44:37.805 --> 01:44:43.644 region:rollup2
BULK OF IT.

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:45.112 region:rollup2
OH YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE'S.

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:46.313 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SEVERAL YEARS THAT

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:47.815 region:rollup2
COINCIDED WITH DRAMATIC STATE

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:49.350 region:rollup2
FUNDING CUTS WHERE THE

01:44:47.815 --> 01:44:51.485 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY TURN TO THE STUDENTS

01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:54.955 region:rollup2
TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE.

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:56.524 region:rollup2
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS WE'VE THE

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:57.491 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT NOW HAS TO THE OF

01:44:56.524 --> 01:44:59.760 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE FINANCE COMMITTEE THAT

01:44:57.491 --> 01:45:01.362 region:rollup2
IS. I'M COMPOSED OF CHANCELLORS

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.831 region:rollup2
AND CAMPUS AYE NANCE LEADERSHIP

01:45:01.362 --> 01:45:05.166 region:rollup2
THAT IS THINKING ABOUT LONG TERM

01:45:03.831 --> 01:45:07.401 region:rollup2
HOTTEST UNIVERSITY ATTAIN.

01:45:05.166 --> 01:45:09.036 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SECURITY SO THAT WE

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:10.604 region:rollup2
WOULD NEVER HAVE A TUITION

01:45:09.036 --> 01:45:12.907 region:rollup2
INCREASE OF GREATER THAN FIVE

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:13.908 region:rollup2
PERCENT THAT'S THE LONG TERM

01:45:12.907 --> 01:45:15.476 region:rollup2
GOAL THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GET

01:45:13.908 --> 01:45:18.179 region:rollup2
TO. SOME OF THESE.

01:45:15.476 --> 01:45:19.613 region:rollup2
STEPS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

01:45:18.179 --> 01:45:22.216 region:rollup2
REQUESTING THAT IF.

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:24.518 region:rollup2
WE GET A FACULTY ENDOWMENT IT

01:45:22.216 --> 01:45:26.320 region:rollup2
FACULTY ENDOWMENTS USE TO JUST

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:27.087 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE FACULTIES RESEARCH.

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:29.089 region:rollup2
THAT WE MAKE IT.

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:30.958 region:rollup2
A REQUIREMENT THAT THE FACULTY

01:45:29.089 --> 01:45:32.426 region:rollup2
SALARY A COMPONENT OF IT ALSO

01:45:30.958 --> 01:45:34.428 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE ON THAT ENDOWMENT.

01:45:32.426 --> 01:45:36.730 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD THEN FREE UP.

01:45:34.428 --> 01:45:38.098 region:rollup2
STATE FUNDS FOR OTHER PURPOSES

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:41.502 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD ALSO MAKE THAT

01:45:38.098 --> 01:45:43.737 region:rollup2
FACULTY POSITION MORE SECURE.

01:45:41.502 --> 01:45:44.305 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S SOME THAT'S ONE ASPECT

01:45:43.737 --> 01:45:46.207 region:rollup2
OF WERE THINKING ABOUT WE'RE

01:45:44.305 --> 01:45:47.608 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO PHILANTHROPY FOR

01:45:46.207 --> 01:45:50.044 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THAT AND.

01:45:47.608 --> 01:45:51.912 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY I'LL HAVE TO COME

01:45:50.044 --> 01:45:53.681 region:rollup2
BACK TO YOU LATER WITH UP WITH

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:56.016 region:rollup2
ACTUAL WITH PLANS THAT ARE BEING

01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:57.618 region:rollup2
FORMULATED. I AM I AM I AM I AM

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:59.453 region:rollup2
I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT PLANS ARE

01:45:57.618 --> 01:46:01.188 region:rollup2
BEING DEVELOPED AND I MEAN THE

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:02.690 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT IN THE ROUGHEST OF

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:03.924 region:rollup2
TIMES FOR THE STATE WHERE WE SEE

01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:06.060 region:rollup2
CUTS ALL AROUND.

01:46:03.924 --> 01:46:08.062 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE A WORLD WHERE WE

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:08.696 region:rollup2
WON'T SEE A THIRTY PERCENT

01:46:08.062 --> 01:46:09.730 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:10.864 region:rollup2
INTUITION.

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:12.333 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:14.468 region:rollup2
COME LATELY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:46:12.333 --> 01:46:16.804 region:rollup2
WHEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:19.106 region:rollup2
IMPLANTS COME THAT. AND WE CAN

01:46:16.804 --> 01:46:19.940 region:rollup2
HAVE WE CAN YOU KNOW BE UPDATED

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:21.075 region:rollup2
ON THAT'S BECAUSE I THINK IT'S.

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.576 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN WE KNOW THAT

01:46:21.075 --> 01:46:23.110 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:24.745 region:rollup2
OUR STATE WILL HIT ANOTHER

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:26.213 region:rollup2
ROUGH.

01:46:24.745 --> 01:46:26.413 region:rollup2
YES ONCE ONCE THERE IS A PLAN

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:27.715 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:46:26.413 --> 01:46:29.016 region:rollup2
.

01:46:27.715 --> 01:46:31.752 region:rollup2
IS SHAREABLE I WILL DEFINITELY

01:46:29.016 --> 01:46:34.221 region:rollup2
BRING IT TO YOU.

01:46:31.752 --> 01:46:35.623 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:37.258 region:rollup2
A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS BEFORE

01:46:35.623 --> 01:46:39.960 region:rollup2
WE MOVE ON I DID WANT TO TO ASK

01:46:37.258 --> 01:46:42.496 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE.

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:44.298 region:rollup2
LUKE CATHOLIC CREDIT DECISION.

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:48.669 region:rollup2
THE FACT FINANCING INCORRECTLY

01:46:44.298 --> 01:46:49.703 region:rollup2
LOOK QUETTA LA CUENTA YEAH THIRD

01:46:48.669 --> 01:46:51.739 region:rollup2
ONE GAME SAID THEY WANT.

01:46:49.703 --> 01:46:53.173 region:rollup2
SO I I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE

01:46:51.739 --> 01:46:54.041 region:rollup2
DECISION THE RATIONALE. I'M SUB

01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:54.642 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT CONFUSED ON THE REQUEST

01:46:54.041 --> 01:46:56.577 region:rollup2
FOR THE ADDITIONAL MONEY IT'S

01:46:54.642 --> 01:46:58.112 region:rollup2
KIND OF FREE MONEY THAT YOU'RE

01:46:56.577 --> 01:47:00.247 region:rollup2
ASKING THE STATE TO TAKE INTO TO

01:46:58.112 --> 01:47:01.515 region:rollup2
HELP. GO THE CAMPUS LEVEL BUT

01:47:00.247 --> 01:47:03.217 region:rollup2
WHY WOULDN'T WE CONSIDER USING.

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:05.953 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:47:03.217 --> 01:47:07.288 region:rollup2
IS IT A MILLION OR NINE.

01:47:05.953 --> 01:47:08.489 region:rollup2
IT WERE NINE MILLION. TO EXPAND

01:47:07.288 --> 01:47:09.790 region:rollup2
ACCESS I GUESS THIS IS THE YOU

01:47:08.489 --> 01:47:11.659 region:rollup2
THAT THE QUESTION THAT WE'RE

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:13.327 region:rollup2
DEBATING HERE IS. TO MAKE IT

01:47:11.659 --> 01:47:14.662 region:rollup2
BETTER FOR THE STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:47:13.327 --> 01:47:16.397 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:47:14.662 --> 01:47:20.234 region:rollup2
FOR TO HELP STUDENTS WHO AREN'T

01:47:16.397 --> 01:47:22.436 region:rollup2
THERE. GET IN TO THE UC SELF.

01:47:20.234 --> 01:47:23.037 region:rollup2
IT'S A POLICY CHOICE AND WHY

01:47:22.436 --> 01:47:25.673 region:rollup2
WOULD WE CHOOSE THAT OVER THE

01:47:23.037 --> 01:47:27.074 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:47:25.673 --> 01:47:28.375 region:rollup2
LET ME MAKE TRIED TO BREAK THIS

01:47:27.074 --> 01:47:30.344 region:rollup2
INTO TWO PARTS OF THE LIQUID A

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:32.713 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT. OF THE PAYMENTS WILL BE

01:47:30.344 --> 01:47:34.748 region:rollup2
COMPLETED AS I STATED PREVIOUSLY

01:47:32.713 --> 01:47:36.884 region:rollup2
IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE

01:47:34.748 --> 01:47:39.086 region:rollup2
REGIONS. OF WORK GOING TO VOTE

01:47:36.884 --> 01:47:41.055 region:rollup2
IN JANUARY BUT DELAYED UNTIL MAY

01:47:39.086 --> 01:47:43.424 region:rollup2
THEIR VOTE TO MAKE THAT

01:47:41.055 --> 01:47:44.858 region:rollup2
SURCHARGE PERMANENT AND USE IT

01:47:43.424 --> 01:47:46.293 region:rollup2
VOTER I SAID GET THAT IDEA. SO

01:47:44.858 --> 01:47:47.861 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT SEPARATE ISSUE

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:50.431 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T ASIAN TURN THE

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:51.699 region:rollup2
TERMINATION PARTY ISSUE FOR THAT

01:47:50.431 --> 01:47:52.866 region:rollup2
YOU'RE REQUESTING US.

01:47:51.699 --> 01:47:55.235 region:rollup2
FLAT OUT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:56.937 region:rollup2
TO HELP.

01:47:55.235 --> 01:48:00.474 region:rollup2
ADD A PAYMENT IN THE BUDGET.

01:47:56.937 --> 01:48:01.909 region:rollup2
TO GO CAMPUS WIDE TO TO HELP YOU

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:04.011 region:rollup2
KNOW THE UNIVERSITY NOT

01:48:01.909 --> 01:48:05.379 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY TO BACKFILL IT BUT.

01:48:04.011 --> 01:48:06.413 region:rollup2
SCAN ADDITIONAL MONEY SO WHY

01:48:05.379 --> 01:48:07.314 region:rollup2
WOULD WE DO THAT AS OPPOSED TO

01:48:06.413 --> 01:48:09.316 region:rollup2
USE THAT NINE MILLION FOR

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:11.018 region:rollup2
EXPANSION.

01:48:09.316 --> 01:48:11.652 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THAT THAT THAT THE

01:48:11.018 --> 01:48:11.852 region:rollup2
LOOK THE REGENTS DECISION ON THE

01:48:11.652 --> 01:48:14.121 region:rollup2
LOS.

01:48:11.852 --> 01:48:15.756 region:rollup2
THE.

01:48:14.121 --> 01:48:17.791 region:rollup2
BIO WILL HELP THE CURRENT

01:48:15.756 --> 01:48:19.893 region:rollup2
STUDENTS NOT MAKE IT PERMANENT

01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:20.894 region:rollup2
ESTA REGIONS HAVE PROPOSED AS

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:23.731 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CONSIDERING TO DOING IN

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:25.532 region:rollup2
DOING MAY. ALSO FOR EIGHTEEN

01:48:23.731 --> 01:48:27.201 region:rollup2
NINETEEN INVOLVEMENT WE HAVE

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:29.703 region:rollup2
ALREADY CONCLUDED OUR ADMISSION

01:48:27.201 --> 01:48:31.271 region:rollup2
PROCESS SO BE QUITE DIFFICULT

01:48:29.703 --> 01:48:33.107 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE MONEY THAT WOULD GO

01:48:31.271 --> 01:48:35.776 region:rollup2
FOR NINETEEN TWENTY OH FOR

01:48:33.107 --> 01:48:37.244 region:rollup2
NINETEEN TWENTY DUMB. WE ALWAYS

01:48:35.776 --> 01:48:38.645 region:rollup2
GO TEARS AHEAD HERE RIGHT.

01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:40.447 region:rollup2
AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR FORWARD

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:42.282 region:rollup2
LOOKING.

01:48:40.447 --> 01:48:44.385 region:rollup2
STANCE ON THIS AS IT IS MUCH

01:48:42.282 --> 01:48:46.320 region:rollup2
EASIER FOR THE UNIVERSITY. TO

01:48:44.385 --> 01:48:48.856 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A SIGNAL FROM THE

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.823 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ON ROMAN BEFORE WE

01:48:48.856 --> 01:48:52.626 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ADMIT STUDENTS.

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:54.361 region:rollup2
.

01:48:52.626 --> 01:48:55.863 region:rollup2
WE WERE PLANNING ON USING THAT

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:57.431 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS FOR HIRING THE

01:48:55.863 --> 01:48:59.133 region:rollup2
FACULTY.

01:48:57.431 --> 01:49:00.968 region:rollup2
AND IF WE WERE TO ADMIT MORE

01:48:59.133 --> 01:49:02.503 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WE WOULD NEED FACULTY

01:49:00.968 --> 01:49:03.670 region:rollup2
FOR THEM SO I SUPPOSE THIS IS

01:49:02.503 --> 01:49:05.706 region:rollup2
ONE POSSIBLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:06.540 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:49:05.706 --> 01:49:10.077 region:rollup2
OKAY BELOW REVISIT THAT.

01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:12.880 region:rollup2
.

01:49:10.077 --> 01:49:14.415 region:rollup2
IN.

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:16.383 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THE OTHER QUESTION IS

01:49:14.415 --> 01:49:19.386 region:rollup2
IS THAT WOULD CERTAINLY.

01:49:16.383 --> 01:49:20.687 region:rollup2
WE ARE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE

01:49:19.386 --> 01:49:21.355 region:rollup2
LAST FEW YEARS THE FUNDS THAT

01:49:20.687 --> 01:49:23.557 region:rollup2
YOU COULD MUM MORE MONEY ON THE

01:49:21.355 --> 01:49:26.060 region:rollup2
TABLE UC'S RESPONDED. ENROLLING

01:49:23.557 --> 01:49:27.361 region:rollup2
MORE QUALIFIED CALIFORNIA KIDS

01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:29.763 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME AND WE'VE CAP

01:49:27.361 --> 01:49:31.498 region:rollup2
THE OUT OF STATE. A NUMBER SO

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:32.099 region:rollup2
GREAT NEWS FOR CALIFORNIA

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:33.167 region:rollup2
FAMILIES TRYING TO GET IN THE

01:49:32.099 --> 01:49:35.769 region:rollup2
UC.

01:49:33.167 --> 01:49:36.103 region:rollup2
AND UC HAS GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND

01:49:35.769 --> 01:49:37.938 region:rollup2
AND KIND OF.

01:49:36.103 --> 01:49:39.640 region:rollup2
.

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:41.775 region:rollup2
YEAH รณ OVER AND OVER AND

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:43.243 region:rollup2
ROLLED OVER IT. ADMITTED

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:44.278 region:rollup2
ENROLLED WITH THAT THE TAKE RATE

01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:45.679 region:rollup2
IS IS HIRED THEN WAS AND

01:49:44.278 --> 01:49:47.247 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED.

01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:48.715 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S A KIND OF A GOOD

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:50.584 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BUT I CUT COMING BACK

01:49:48.715 --> 01:49:53.587 region:rollup2
INTO AND ASKING FOR MORE

01:49:50.584 --> 01:49:55.622 region:rollup2
RESOURCES. SO THE CSU DOES NOT

01:49:53.587 --> 01:49:56.857 region:rollup2
DO THAT RIGHT DAY THEY OVER AND

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:58.358 region:rollup2

RESOURCES THAT YOU'RE ASKING TO

01:50:18.212 --> 01:50:23.951 region:rollup2
TO GO BACK TO CONTINUE TO GROW

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:25.986 region:rollup2
FOR NINETEEN TWENTY.

01:50:23.951 --> 01:50:28.589 region:rollup2
THE QUALITY ON THE CAMPUSES IS

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:30.257 region:rollup2
SUFFERING AND OUR CORE FUNDS ARE

01:50:28.589 --> 01:50:32.059 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

FULLY UTILIZE TO PROVIDE

01:50:32.059 --> 01:50:35.329 region:rollup2
SERVICES ON THE CAMPUSES IN THE

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:38.031 region:rollup2
PAPER INSTRUCTORS.

A WE HAVE TAKEN AGGRESSIVE STEPS

01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:41.869 region:rollup2
BEHIND THE SCENES TO SAVE COST

01:50:39.967 --> 01:50:43.737 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A NEW

01:50:41.869 --> 01:50:45.038 region:rollup2
PROCUREMENT PROCESS WITHIN DO

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:47.341 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE

TOOK. SEVERAL YEARS OF PLANNING

01:50:47.341 --> 01:50:51.278 region:rollup2
AND ORGANIZING BUT IS NOW SAVING

01:50:49.543 --> 01:50:53.080 region:rollup2
OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:50:51.278 --> 01:50:53.947 region:rollup2
A YEAR FOR OUR CAMPUSES. SO

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.983 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE THING WE'VE DONE TO

01:50:53.947 --> 01:50:57.451 region:rollup2
TRY AND CONTAIN COSTS SO THAT WE

01:50:55.983 --> 01:50:59.987 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T. OVER BURDEN THE

01:50:57.451 --> 01:51:00.888 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES WE'VE ALSO CREATED OUR

01:50:59.987 --> 01:51:03.991 region:rollup2
OWN INTERNAL.

01:51:00.888 --> 01:51:05.959 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PULL SYSTEM.

01:51:03.991 --> 01:51:07.861 region:rollup2
OF WHERE WE INSURE OUR BUILDINGS

01:51:05.959 --> 01:51:09.796 region:rollup2
NOW AND WE HAVE ALSO MOVED OUR

01:51:07.861 --> 01:51:11.765 region:rollup2
WORKERS COMP ON TO THIS AS WELL.

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:13.200 region:rollup2
UP WHICH OF STAVING OVER FIVE

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:14.668 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AS A

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.803 region:rollup2
WE'RE TAKING SOME STEPS TO TRY

01:51:14.668 --> 01:51:17.404 region:rollup2
AND SAVE COST SO THAT THE

01:51:16.803 --> 01:51:19.606 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES.

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:20.674 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE RESOURCES FREED UP

01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:22.342 region:rollup2
TO TAKE CARE OF THE EXISTING

01:51:20.674 --> 01:51:23.310 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BUT WE ARE FINDING

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:24.311 region:rollup2
OURSELVES OVER STRETCHED

01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:25.913 region:rollup2
STUDENTS CAN'T GET INTO THEIR

01:51:24.311 --> 01:51:28.515 region:rollup2
MAJORS.

01:51:25.913 --> 01:51:30.884 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE WEEK DESPERATE NEED

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:33.687 region:rollup2
TO HIRE MORE FACULTY.

01:51:30.884 --> 01:51:34.955 region:rollup2
THE CSU IS REQUESTING MORE FUNDS

01:51:33.687 --> 01:51:36.723 region:rollup2
ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS

01:51:34.955 --> 01:51:37.791 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL SO I'M

01:51:36.723 --> 01:51:39.193 region:rollup2
NOT CERTAIN WHAT THEY'RE

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:40.394 region:rollup2
PROPOSING TO USE THOSE FUNDS FOR

01:51:39.193 --> 01:51:43.564 region:rollup2
WE WANNA MAKE CERTAIN THAT

01:51:40.394 --> 01:51:45.299 region:rollup2
QUALITY AT UC DOES NOT FALL.

01:51:43.564 --> 01:51:47.734 region:rollup2
WE.

01:51:45.299 --> 01:51:49.803 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO ENROLL STUDENTS

01:51:47.734 --> 01:51:51.805 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF

01:51:49.803 --> 01:51:52.706 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT.

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:54.241 region:rollup2
DO TWENTY ELEVEN EVEN THOUGH WE

01:51:52.706 --> 01:51:56.109 region:rollup2
WERE LOSING STATE FUNDS AT THE

01:51:54.241 --> 01:51:58.612 region:rollup2
SAME TIME.

01:51:56.109 --> 01:52:00.280 region:rollup2
SO THE CSU.

01:51:58.612 --> 01:52:01.982 region:rollup2
NOV SCALED BACK THEIR ENROLLMENT

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:03.116 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME SO THEY WERE ABLE

01:52:01.982 --> 01:52:06.553 region:rollup2
TO RETAIN SOME OF THE DOLLARS

01:52:03.116 --> 01:52:08.422 region:rollup2
PER STUDENT THAT WE WERE LOSING.

01:52:06.553 --> 01:52:10.257 region:rollup2
SO THAT MIGHT BE ONE ONE REASON

01:52:08.422 --> 01:52:12.492 region:rollup2
WHY THEY. DON'T FEEL THAT THEY

01:52:10.257 --> 01:52:14.828 region:rollup2
NEED THOSE DOLLARS.

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:15.796 region:rollup2
OKAY MIXTURE.

01:52:14.828 --> 01:52:19.266 region:rollup2

01:57:31.645 --> 01:57:34.481 region:rollup2
UC DOES NOT ACCOUNT

01:57:33.113 --> 01:57:36.049 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE COST OF

01:57:34.481 --> 01:57:38.084 region:rollup2
ENROLLING MEDICAL RESIDENTS I TO

01:57:36.049 --> 01:57:39.719 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND AYE WHETHER THE SHIFT

01:57:38.084 --> 01:57:41.021 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE FISCAL IMPACTS WE

01:57:39.719 --> 01:57:42.222 region:rollup2
USED A YOU SEE THAT OLOGY. THAT

01:57:41.021 --> 01:57:44.357 region:rollup2
USED OTHER CONTACTS AND WE ARE

01:57:42.222 --> 01:57:46.159 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT THAT THIS SHIFT WILL

01:57:44.357 --> 01:57:47.961 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS ON

01:57:46.159 --> 01:57:52.732 region:rollup2

ELIOT SO THIS.

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:56.770 region:rollup2
ISSUE RELATES TO AN

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:57.938 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION DECISION MADE

01:57:56.770 --> 01:57:59.072 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR BY THE STATE THE

01:57:57.938 --> 01:58:00.840 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTED IT I

01:57:59.072 --> 01:58:01.207 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:02.842 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE YOU.

01:58:01.207 --> 01:58:03.777 region:rollup2
I JUST REMIND THE COMMITTEE OF

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:06.746 region:rollup2
THAT DECISION.

01:58:03.777 --> 01:58:08.114 region:rollup2
AT LAST YEAR THE. STATE

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.615 region:rollup2
PROVIDED THAT YOU SEE RECEIVE

01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:10.083 region:rollup2
THE FIRST.

01:58:08.615 --> 01:58:11.318 region:rollup2
INSTALLMENT OF THE FORTY

01:58:10.083 --> 01:58:11.851 region:rollup2
MILLION FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL

01:58:11.318 --> 01:58:14.187 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FROM PROPOSITION

01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:17.390 region:rollup2
THE SEX.

01:58:14.187 --> 01:58:19.359 region:rollup2
AND ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE OF

01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:21.261 region:rollup2
THE STATE DECIDED TO DO WAS TO

01:58:19.359 --> 01:58:23.129 region:rollup2
USE THAT OF FORTY MILLION

01:58:21.261 --> 01:58:24.798 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO SHIFT A LIKE AMOUNT

01:58:23.129 --> 01:58:26.800 region:rollup2
OF GENERAL FUND THAT YOU SEE

01:58:24.798 --> 01:58:28.501 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED IT WAS SPENDING ON. ON

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:29.069 region:rollup2
GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND

01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:31.204 region:rollup2
AND SHIFT THAT GENERAL FUND

01:58:29.069 --> 01:58:33.606 region:rollup2
INTO.

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:35.575 region:rollup2
UC'S GENERAL CAMPUS BUDGET AND

01:58:33.606 --> 01:58:37.077 region:rollup2
THAT SHIFT WAS SCORED AS PART OF

01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:38.745 region:rollup2
UC'S BASED INCREASE IN THAT YEAR

01:58:37.077 --> 01:58:40.413 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND BASED INCREASE.

01:58:38.745 --> 01:58:42.015 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT OF TAT DECISION WAS

01:58:40.413 --> 01:58:44.017 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY TO HOLD A RESIDENCY

01:58:42.015 --> 01:58:46.052 region:rollup2
SLOTS FLAT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:58:44.017 --> 01:58:47.854 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RATHER THAN CREATE A

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:48.321 region:rollup2
NEW PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:58:47.854 --> 01:58:50.557 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE

01:58:48.321 --> 01:58:51.157 region:rollup2
RESIDENCIES.

01:58:50.557 --> 01:58:53.927 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHAT THIS ISSUE ARE

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:55.061 region:rollup2
RELATES TO.

01:58:53.927 --> 01:58:56.062 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT IT BE HELPFUL TO JUST

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:57.330 region:rollup2
WALK THE COMMITTEE THROUGH SOME

01:58:56.062 --> 01:58:58.565 region:rollup2
OF THE OTHER GRADUATE MEDICAL

01:58:57.330 --> 01:59:00.066 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ISSUES IN THE BUDGET.

01:58:58.565 --> 01:59:01.201 region:rollup2
.

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:03.436 region:rollup2
IT IS PART OF A SEPARATE.

01:59:01.201 --> 01:59:05.138 region:rollup2
.

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:06.473 region:rollup2
A DEAL MADE OF A LAST YEAR THE

01:59:05.138 --> 01:59:07.007 region:rollup2
STATE IS PROVIDING A HUNDRED

01:59:06.473 --> 01:59:08.341 region:rollup2

THE HOSPITALS HAD RECEIVED AN

01:59:22.856 --> 01:59:25.892 region:rollup2
AWESOME IS ALSO TO EXPAND

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:27.494 region:rollup2
RESIDENCY SLOTS AS WELL.

01:59:25.892 --> 01:59:28.662 region:rollup2
OTHERS ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT

01:59:27.494 --> 01:59:30.397 region:rollup2
IT THIS YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF

GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION

01:59:36.970 --> 01:59:40.040 region:rollup2
COSTS.

01:59:38.204 --> 01:59:41.141 region:rollup2
IF THAT DEAL.

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:42.976 region:rollup2
LET'S GO THROUGH ITS ESTIMATED

01:59:41.141 --> 01:59:44.110 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE A FEW HUNDRED MILLION

01:59:42.976 --> 01:59:46.112 region:rollup2

ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING SO FOR

01:59:56.923 --> 02:00:00.560 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IF IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

01:59:58.658 --> 02:00:02.395 region:rollup2
IN PROVIDING MORE FUNDING TO

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:03.963 region:rollup2
GRAD GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION.

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:05.565 region:rollup2
ONE NATURAL AREA IS THE SONG

02:00:03.963 --> 02:00:06.199 region:rollup2
BROWN PROGRAM AT THE OFFICE OF

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:10.770 region:rollup2
THAT ALREADY EXISTS.

02:00:10.103 --> 02:00:11.704 region:rollup2
ON AND SO THE THERE THERE'S SOME

02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:13.273 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE THERE TO SORT OF

02:00:11.704 --> 02:00:14.407 region:rollup2
TARGET FUNDING TOWARDS THEIR.

02:00:13.273 --> 02:00:15.642 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO

02:00:14.407 --> 02:00:17.410 region:rollup2
PROVIDE MORE GENERAL FUND TO THE

02:00:15.642 --> 02:00:18.278 region:rollup2

THAT COULD HAVE I COULD SORT OF.

02:00:19.946 --> 02:00:23.083 region:rollup2
OF OF WAY THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS

02:00:21.715 --> 02:00:24.284 region:rollup2
DECIDED LAST YEAR IF THAT'S YOUR

02:00:23.083 --> 02:00:25.485 region:rollup2
DECISION WE WOULD JUST RECOMMEND

ON AND HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT

02:00:27.854 --> 02:00:30.790 region:rollup2
FUNDING WOULD BE A NEW PROGRAM.

02:00:29.522 --> 02:00:32.459 region:rollup2

02:00:44.571 --> 02:00:47.607 region:rollup2
IF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:00:45.839 --> 02:00:49.209 region:rollup2
PROPOSES TO TAKE FORTY MILLION

02:00:47.607 --> 02:00:50.543 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OUT OF THE UC'S BUDGET

02:00:49.209 --> 02:00:52.145 region:rollup2

FIVE QUARTERS WORTH A FUNDING

02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:08.161 region:rollup2
SO WOULD BE FORTY MILLION GOING

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:09.829 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:01:08.161 --> 02:01:11.698 region:rollup2
WHAT MAY HAVE CONFUSED A LOT OF

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:13.099 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WAS THAT THE?

02:01:11.698 --> 02:01:15.001 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX REFERS TO

THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

02:01:26.412 --> 02:01:30.316 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOST THOSE FUNDS THAT

CAME OUT OF OUR MEDICAL SCHOOLS

02:01:30.316 --> 02:01:33.853 region:rollup2

02:14:15.581 --> 02:14:17.449 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TO ASH AND FRANCE

02:14:16.115 --> 02:14:19.852 region:rollup2
STANCE.

02:14:17.449 --> 02:14:22.154 region:rollup2
I STUDENTS AT EVERY CAMPUS ARE

02:14:19.852 --> 02:14:23.756 region:rollup2
ENTITLED TO THE SAME LEVEL OF

02:14:22.154 --> 02:14:25.090 region:rollup2
STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. SET

02:14:23.756 --> 02:14:26.592 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:28.594 region:rollup2
TO THE LEGISLATURE IN AND WE

02:14:26.592 --> 02:14:30.429 region:rollup2
SHARE THAT PRINCIPLE. AND

02:14:28.594 --> 02:14:33.265 region:rollup2
FINALLY THAT YOU CO P. WILL

02:14:30.429 --> 02:14:35.634 region:rollup2
PROVIDE CERTAIN CENTRAL SERVICES

02:14:33.265 --> 02:14:37.803 region:rollup2
AND SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAMMING THAT

02:14:35.634 --> 02:14:39.405 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES PAY A FAIR SHARE OUGHT

02:14:37.803 --> 02:14:42.041 region:rollup2
TO RECIEVE.

02:14:39.405 --> 02:14:43.676 region:rollup2
IN THE NEXT PORTION YOU SEE MORE

02:14:42.041 --> 02:14:45.110 region:rollup2
ABOUT THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR

02:14:43.676 --> 02:14:46.712 region:rollup2
YOU CO P. SERVICES THAT I JUST

02:14:45.110 --> 02:14:48.380 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

02:14:46.712 --> 02:14:50.616 region:rollup2
I THEY WERE NEGOTIATED AND

02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:52.618 region:rollup2
LARGELY FORMULA BASED AND

02:14:50.616 --> 02:14:55.354 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THAT FEE FOR SERVICES

02:14:52.618 --> 02:14:57.489 region:rollup2
MODEL THAT CAMPUSES WOULD PAY TO

02:14:55.354 --> 02:14:58.991 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL OFFICE AS AN ANNUAL

02:14:57.489 --> 02:15:01.860 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT.

02:14:58.991 --> 02:15:03.796 region:rollup2
I'M IN IT WAS BASED LARGELY ON

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:07.333 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEES THE

02:15:03.796 --> 02:15:08.867 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF AYE SPANS AYE AND SOME

02:15:07.333 --> 02:15:10.402 region:rollup2
OTHER FACTORS THAT WERE WERE

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:11.670 region:rollup2
FORMULA BASED TO TRY AND

02:15:10.402 --> 02:15:13.872 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE A

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:15.708 region:rollup2
REASONABLE ASSESSMENT TO PAY FOR

02:15:13.872 --> 02:15:17.076 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL SERVICES.

02:15:15.708 --> 02:15:18.877 region:rollup2
THE STATE HOWEVER WANTED TO

02:15:17.076 --> 02:15:22.348 region:rollup2
CHANGE THIS MODEL AND IN THE

02:15:18.877 --> 02:15:24.249 region:rollup2
BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN I

02:15:22.348 --> 02:15:25.618 region:rollup2
THEY DID TAKE ACTION.

02:15:24.249 --> 02:15:27.619 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENED BASICALLY IS

02:15:25.618 --> 02:15:29.755 region:rollup2
AYE THE STATE REPLACED THE STATE

02:15:27.619 --> 02:15:32.157 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND SUPPORT ALLOCATION

02:15:29.755 --> 02:15:32.992 region:rollup2
FOR THE UNIVERSITY. WITH THREE

02:15:32.157 --> 02:15:34.627 region:rollup2
STATE GENERAL FUND

02:15:32.992 --> 02:15:36.395 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS

02:15:34.627 --> 02:15:37.830 region:rollup2
ONE IS THE MAIN YOU SEE SUPPORT

02:15:36.395 --> 02:15:39.198 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION WE'VE BEEN

02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:40.966 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING AYE THERE'S ANOTHER

02:15:39.198 --> 02:15:43.602 region:rollup2
ONE FOR YOU SEE PATH WHICH IS

02:15:40.966 --> 02:15:45.004 region:rollup2
THE NEXT ITEM AFTER US HERE. AND

02:15:43.602 --> 02:15:47.373 region:rollup2
ONE FOR YOU SEE OFFICE OF THE

02:15:45.004 --> 02:15:48.774 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT AYE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS

02:15:47.373 --> 02:15:49.875 region:rollup2
OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

02:15:48.774 --> 02:15:51.910 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING

02:15:49.875 --> 02:15:54.580 region:rollup2
IN THIS ITEM.

02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:55.981 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M. UC'S ONE GENERAL

02:15:54.580 --> 02:15:58.117 region:rollup2
FUND SPORT ALLOCATION THEN

02:15:55.981 --> 02:16:00.019 region:rollup2
BECAME THREE AND WHAT THE STATUS

02:15:58.117 --> 02:16:02.154 region:rollup2
IT ELIMINATED THE CAMPUSES

02:16:00.019 --> 02:16:03.956 region:rollup2
HAVING TO PAY AN ASSESSMENT.

02:16:02.154 --> 02:16:05.457 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO REDUCED BY THE

02:16:03.956 --> 02:16:06.992 region:rollup2
AMOUNT THAT CAMPUSES WOULD

02:16:05.457 --> 02:16:09.395 region:rollup2
RECIEVE THROUGH THAT MAIN

02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:11.130 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION BY AN EQUAL AMOUNT

02:16:09.395 --> 02:16:13.632 region:rollup2
SO IT IT BALANCED OUT IT WAS

02:16:11.130 --> 02:16:15.467 region:rollup2
BASICALLY I ONE FOR ONE.

02:16:13.632 --> 02:16:17.503 region:rollup2
I'M YOU SEE DID OPPOSE THIS

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:18.937 region:rollup2
CHANGE AT THE TIME AND IT WAS

02:16:17.503 --> 02:16:20.706 region:rollup2
DECIDED IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE

02:16:18.937 --> 02:16:22.841 region:rollup2
TO MOVE FORWARD OUT WE BELIEVE

02:16:20.706 --> 02:16:24.343 region:rollup2
THAT THE PRIOR SYSTEM WHERE

02:16:22.841 --> 02:16:27.179 region:rollup2
CAMPUS CONTRIBUTE.

02:16:24.343 --> 02:16:29.148 region:rollup2
BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT I MADE

02:16:27.179 --> 02:16:30.883 region:rollup2
SENSE AND WE THINK IT MAKES

02:16:29.148 --> 02:16:32.785 region:rollup2
SENSE BECAUSE IT'S A FEE FOR

02:16:30.883 --> 02:16:34.319 region:rollup2
SERVICES STYLE MODEL WHERE THE

02:16:32.785 --> 02:16:35.954 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES CAN DETERMINE IN

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:37.589 region:rollup2
CONJUNCTION WITH YOU SEE OFFICE

02:16:35.954 --> 02:16:39.358 region:rollup2
OF THE PRESIDENT. WHAT THEY WANT

02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:41.060 region:rollup2
TO HAVE PERFORMED AS A CENTRAL

02:16:39.358 --> 02:16:43.429 region:rollup2
SERVICE AND WHAT THEY DON'T WANT

02:16:41.060 --> 02:16:45.464 region:rollup2
TO PURCHASE AND SORT OF INPUT

02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:47.666 region:rollup2
INTO HOW MUCH THEY'RE WILLING TO

02:16:45.464 --> 02:16:49.635 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE FOR THOSE SERVICES?

02:16:47.666 --> 02:16:51.136 region:rollup2
I'M YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THAT

02:16:49.635 --> 02:16:53.005 region:rollup2
CAMPUS CONTRIBUTION AS

02:16:51.136 --> 02:16:54.873 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT AYE WE THINK WOULD

02:16:53.005 --> 02:16:57.076 region:rollup2
RESTORE INAPPROPRIATE

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:59.445 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AT CAMPUSES

02:16:57.076 --> 02:17:01.580 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY FOR FUNDING. YOU

02:16:59.445 --> 02:17:03.515 region:rollup2
CO P. AND THE CAMPUS ITSELF AND

02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:05.651 region:rollup2
BY THAT I MEAN. THAT SOME OF THE

02:17:03.515 --> 02:17:07.419 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES ARE LARGER AND HAVE

02:17:05.651 --> 02:17:09.688 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS FOR

02:17:07.419 --> 02:17:11.190 region:rollup2
INSTANCE AND HAVE MORE EMPLOYEES

02:17:09.688 --> 02:17:13.726 region:rollup2
AND MORE STUDENTS.

02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:16.228 region:rollup2
SO THE ASSESSMENT THAT THEY WERE

02:17:13.726 --> 02:17:17.830 region:rollup2
PAYING WAS LARGER AYE NOW THEY

02:17:16.228 --> 02:17:18.664 region:rollup2
DON'T PAY THAT ASSESSMENT AND

02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:20.799 region:rollup2
SAID THEY'RE SORT OF

02:17:18.664 --> 02:17:22.234 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFITING

02:17:20.799 --> 02:17:23.936 region:rollup2
FROM NOT HAVING TO PAY THAT

02:17:22.234 --> 02:17:25.871 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT. WHERE SOME OF THE

02:17:23.936 --> 02:17:28.540 region:rollup2
SMALLER CAMPUSES THAT DON'T HAVE

02:17:25.871 --> 02:17:30.843 region:rollup2
AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER I

02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:32.544 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN OUR VIEW?

02:17:30.843 --> 02:17:35.380 region:rollup2
UNFAIRLY PUNISHED

02:17:32.544 --> 02:17:37.049 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS WE HAD

02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:39.051 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE SOME INTERNAL

02:17:37.049 --> 02:17:40.619 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. TO MAKE

02:17:39.051 --> 02:17:42.654 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE CAMPUS IS WERE

02:17:40.619 --> 02:17:44.423 region:rollup2
HELD HARMLESS IN THIS NEW MODEL

02:17:42.654 --> 02:17:46.658 region:rollup2
SO THAT THERE WASN'T.

02:17:44.423 --> 02:17:49.194 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE WASN'T SOME SORT

02:17:46.658 --> 02:17:50.362 region:rollup2
OF A DISPROPORTIONATE BENEFIT BY

02:17:49.194 --> 02:17:52.631 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING TO PAY THIS

02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:53.966 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT. THAT WOULD GO DOES

02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:56.435 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE LARGER BETTER

02:17:53.966 --> 02:17:57.035 region:rollup2
RESOURCE TO CAMPUSES SO ON

02:17:56.435 --> 02:17:57.970 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL

02:17:57.035 --> 02:18:00.105 region:rollup2
IS.

02:17:57.970 --> 02:18:01.640 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARY IT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:18:00.105 --> 02:18:04.176 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW AND IT'S

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:06.178 region:rollup2
LESS TRANSPARENT IN SOME WAY SO

02:18:04.176 --> 02:18:07.913 region:rollup2
I'M WE WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO

02:18:06.178 --> 02:18:09.748 region:rollup2
THE PRIOR ASSESSMENT.

02:18:07.913 --> 02:18:11.049 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN INDICATED THAT.

02:18:09.748 --> 02:18:12.117 region:rollup2
BY THE BY THE CHAIRMAN I

02:18:11.049 --> 02:18:13.819 region:rollup2
BELIEVE AND I DON'T MEAN TO PUT

02:18:12.117 --> 02:18:15.954 region:rollup2
WORDS IN HIS MOUTH THAT THAT'S

02:18:13.819 --> 02:18:18.090 region:rollup2
NOT SOMETHING. THAT I HE WANTED

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:20.092 region:rollup2
TO FAVOR THIS YEAR AYE BUT IT IS

02:18:18.090 --> 02:18:22.327 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE DID I REQUEST.

02:18:20.092 --> 02:18:22.895 region:rollup2
THROUGH BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL

02:18:22.327 --> 02:18:24.062 region:rollup2
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:18:22.895 --> 02:18:25.664 region:rollup2
AND.

02:18:24.062 --> 02:18:27.132 region:rollup2
THEY DID NOT PUT THAT INTO THE

02:18:25.664 --> 02:18:29.535 region:rollup2
JANUARY INTRODUCTIONS TO THE WAY

02:18:27.132 --> 02:18:31.436 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE NOW ARE WITH A DIRECT

02:18:29.535 --> 02:18:32.805 region:rollup2
LINE ITEM APPROPRIATION FOR THE

02:18:31.436 --> 02:18:34.540 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. A

02:18:32.805 --> 02:18:37.176 region:rollup2
DIRECT LINE ITEM APPROPRIATION

02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:38.343 region:rollup2
FOR YOU SEE PATH AND THAT OUR

02:18:37.176 --> 02:18:41.814 region:rollup2
MAIN SUPPORT APPROPRIATION.

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:44.416 region:rollup2
SO I MOVING ON FROM THAT TO

02:18:41.814 --> 02:18:45.584 region:rollup2
SLIDE FIVE PER PAGE FIVE I JUST

02:18:44.416 --> 02:18:47.753 region:rollup2
WANT TO TOUCH ON.

02:18:45.584 --> 02:18:49.054 region:rollup2
A FEW RECENT CHANGES THAT THE

02:18:47.753 --> 02:18:50.289 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THAT

02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:51.824 region:rollup2
IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND BEST

02:18:50.289 --> 02:18:53.025 region:rollup2
PRACTICES.

02:18:51.824 --> 02:18:53.525 region:rollup2
THE OUT IT YOU'RE QUITE FAMILIAR

02:18:53.025 --> 02:18:55.327 region:rollup2
pWITH.

02:18:53.525 --> 02:18:56.995 region:rollup2
APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE

02:18:55.327 --> 02:18:58.797 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR MADE

02:18:56.995 --> 02:19:00.566 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE RECOMMENDATIONS WE

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:02.734 region:rollup2
ARE IMPLEMENTING ALL THIRTY

02:19:00.566 --> 02:19:05.137 region:rollup2
THREE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IT TEN.

02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:06.505 region:rollup2
ARE DUE ON APRIL TWENTY FIFTH

02:19:05.137 --> 02:19:08.240 region:rollup2
THE BALANCE ARE DUE IN APRIL OF

02:19:06.505 --> 02:19:10.142 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINETEEN IN APRIL OF

02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:12.578 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY. AYE IN ADDITION

02:19:10.142 --> 02:19:14.213 region:rollup2
WE ARE DOING THIS ORGANIZATIONAL

02:19:12.578 --> 02:19:16.181 region:rollup2
OPTIMIZATION TO ANSWER RARE

02:19:14.213 --> 02:19:18.383 region:rollup2
RIGHT ORGANIZED RIGHT SIZED AND

02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:19.418 region:rollup2
RIGHT SERVICES AN EXAMPLE OF

02:19:18.383 --> 02:19:21.420 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE'VE ALREADY

02:19:19.418 --> 02:19:23.422 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHED JUST RECENTLY AND

02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:25.958 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IT STARTS ON ME ONE.

02:19:23.422 --> 02:19:27.593 region:rollup2
SWEET MERGED TWO DIVISIONSAT

02:19:25.958 --> 02:19:29.127 region:rollup2
THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

02:19:27.593 --> 02:19:31.730 region:rollup2
WHICH ELIMINATES ONE OF OUR

02:19:29.127 --> 02:19:33.198 region:rollup2
SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT POSITIONS

02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:34.700 region:rollup2
SO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND

02:19:33.198 --> 02:19:36.768 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARE GOING TO BE

02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:37.369 region:rollup2
BROUGHT TOGETHER IN ONE DEBATE

02:19:36.768 --> 02:19:39.004 region:rollup2
AND.

02:19:37.369 --> 02:19:39.805 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT

02:19:39.004 --> 02:19:41.440 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT.

02:19:39.805 --> 02:19:43.175 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO NEED FOR TWO SENIOR

02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:45.277 region:rollup2
VICE PRESIDENTS FOR ONE DIVISION

02:19:43.175 --> 02:19:47.012 region:rollup2
SO I ONE OF THOSE POSITIONS WILL

02:19:45.277 --> 02:19:49.181 region:rollup2
BE ELIMINATED THAT IS JUST AN

02:19:47.012 --> 02:19:51.984 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THIS IS GOING TO BE A

02:19:49.181 --> 02:19:53.485 region:rollup2
LONG TERM PROCESS TO TRY AND I

02:19:51.984 --> 02:19:54.419 region:rollup2
REORGANIZED IN A WAY THAT MAKES

02:19:53.485 --> 02:19:56.321 region:rollup2
SENSE.

02:19:54.419 --> 02:19:57.990 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO BE JUST MOVING

02:19:56.321 --> 02:20:00.192 region:rollup2
DECK CHAIRS AROUND.

02:19:57.990 --> 02:20:00.592 region:rollup2
ON THE THERESE SHIP WE WANT TO

02:20:00.192 --> 02:20:01.894 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT.

02:20:00.592 --> 02:20:03.862 region:rollup2
THESE SORTS OF THINGS MAKE

02:20:01.894 --> 02:20:05.264 region:rollup2
SENSE THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF

02:20:03.862 --> 02:20:06.732 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT MADE SENSE AND SO

02:20:05.264 --> 02:20:07.799 region:rollup2
WE TOOK THAT ACTION.

02:20:06.732 --> 02:20:08.900 region:rollup2
I YOU'LL HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:20:07.799 --> 02:20:10.302 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET

02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:11.270 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE SO I WON'T GO INTO

02:20:10.302 --> 02:20:12.938 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THAT'S A WAY OF GETTING

02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:14.506 region:rollup2

PRESSURE ON COSTS

02:26:40.358 --> 02:26:44.062 region:rollup2

I'LL ADD THAT A THREE PERCENT

02:27:04.049 --> 02:27:06.951 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY NINE MILLION

02:27:22.767 --> 02:27:27.739 region:rollup2
THINK I IS DRIVEN BY THINGS SUCH

02:27:24.836 --> 02:27:28.973 region:rollup2
AS RESEARCH GRANTS AND FUNDS

02:27:27.739 --> 02:27:30.475 region:rollup2
THAT CAN INCREASE THE HARM.

02:27:28.973 --> 02:27:33.378 region:rollup2

IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART.

02:40:50.407 --> 02:40:53.144 region:rollup2
IT'S A BIT BUSY SO LET ME

02:40:51.775 --> 02:40:54.612 region:rollup2
DECOMPOSE IT A BIT FOR YOU THE

NINETEEN. THAT'S WHAT BECAUSE

02:41:17.034 --> 02:41:21.038 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BASIS FOR THE GROWTH

02:41:19.637 --> 02:41:23.641 region:rollup2
IN OUR OPERATING BUDGET FOR

02:41:21.038 --> 02:41:26.076 region:rollup2

NO ADDITIONAL STAFFING.

02:41:32.283 --> 02:41:35.119 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE OPERATING BUDGET IS

02:41:33.484 --> 02:41:36.320 region:rollup2
HELD FLAT.

02:41:35.119 --> 02:41:37.788 region:rollup2
OR EVEN WITH A THREE PERCENT

02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:39.456 region:rollup2
BASE ADJUSTMENT.

02:41:37.788 --> 02:41:40.357 region:rollup2
WE WILL NOT HAVE THE STAFFING

02:41:39.456 --> 02:41:41.926 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS

02:41:40.357 --> 02:41:44.094 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

FINAL DEPLOYMENTS.

02:41:59.176 --> 02:42:00.911 region:rollup2
ARE OR TO LOOK FOR OTHER WAYS

.

02:46:00.083 --> 02:46:03.620 region:rollup2
I IF I REMEMBER IT'S PROBABLY

02:46:02.052 --> 02:46:05.956 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:07.958 region:rollup2
THREE FLOORS SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:46:05.956 --> 02:46:09.193 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A LOT LOUDERSPACE FOR

02:46:07.958 --> 02:46:11.929 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

02:46:09.193 --> 02:46:14.865 region:rollup2

EMPLOYEES AND TWENTY BUT IT IS

02:46:14.865 --> 02:46:19.736 region:rollup2
BEEN A SLOW PROCESS FOR YOU SEE.

02:46:17.634 --> 02:46:22.072 region:rollup2
TO TO MAKE IT OPERATIONAL FOR

02:46:19.736 --> 02:46:23.774 region:rollup2
THE OTHER CAMPUSES.

02:46:22.072 --> 02:46:24.708 region:rollup2
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT I CAN'T

02:46:23.774 --> 02:46:26.210 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO THAT AND I APPRECIATE

02:46:24.708 --> 02:46:28.278 region:rollup2
THE OBSERVATION.

02:46:26.210 --> 02:46:30.314 region:rollup2
THE UC PATH PROJECT.

02:46:28.278 --> 02:46:32.583 region:rollup2
INITIALLY WAS SOLD.

02:46:30.314 --> 02:46:33.784 region:rollup2
.

02:46:32.583 --> 02:46:35.219 region:rollup2
I SAY SOLD IT WAS.

02:46:33.784 --> 02:46:36.753 region:rollup2
PRESENTED TO THE REGENTS AS AN

02:46:35.219 --> 02:46:40.224 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:42.459 region:rollup2
UP TO SAVE MONEY AND AND REALLY

02:46:40.224 --> 02:46:43.694 region:rollup2
FORCE AS A FORCING FUNCTION FOR

02:46:42.459 --> 02:46:45.195 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY SYSTEM

02:46:43.694 --> 02:46:47.764 region:rollup2
WIDE.

02:46:45.195 --> 02:46:49.166 region:rollup2
WE KNEW THAT THE LEGACY PAYROLL

02:46:47.764 --> 02:46:51.535 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHICH WE CALL PPS.

02:46:49.166 --> 02:46:54.571 region:rollup2
FAILING.

02:46:51.535 --> 02:46:55.873 region:rollup2
OUR WE UNDERSTOOD THAT OUT WE

02:46:54.571 --> 02:46:57.574 region:rollup2
HAD SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE

02:46:55.873 --> 02:47:00.143 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

02:46:57.574 --> 02:47:01.345 region:rollup2
OUR IN OUR EXECUTION OF PAYROLL

02:47:00.143 --> 02:47:02.713 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE FACT WE HAD ELEVEN

02:47:01.345 --> 02:47:04.081 region:rollup2
SEPARATE VERSIONS OF THE PAYROLL

02:47:02.713 --> 02:47:06.750 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:47:04.081 --> 02:47:08.385 region:rollup2
UP SO I BELIEVE THAT THE

02:47:06.750 --> 02:47:11.288 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL.

02:47:08.385 --> 02:47:13.323 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP OF THE PROJECT.

02:47:11.288 --> 02:47:13.824 region:rollup2
FELT THAT BY QUICKLY

02:47:13.323 --> 02:47:16.360 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING A SOFTWARE

02:47:13.824 --> 02:47:17.928 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:18.395 region:rollup2
WE WOULD FORCE THE ADOPTION OF A

02:47:17.928 --> 02:47:20.531 region:rollup2
COMMON SET OF BUSINESS

02:47:18.395 --> 02:47:21.131 region:rollup2
PROCESSES.

02:47:20.531 --> 02:47:22.799 region:rollup2
THAT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THE

02:47:21.131 --> 02:47:24.334 region:rollup2
CASE.

02:47:22.799 --> 02:47:24.968 region:rollup2
AND AND THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF

02:47:24.334 --> 02:47:26.703 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT.

02:47:24.968 --> 02:47:28.672 region:rollup2
WERE SPENT.

02:47:26.703 --> 02:47:31.341 region:rollup2
ARE IN WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS

02:47:28.672 --> 02:47:33.310 region:rollup2
A RATHER AGONIZING AMOUNT OF.

02:47:31.341 --> 02:47:34.645 region:rollup2
FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN

02:47:33.310 --> 02:47:36.847 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL PROJECT OFFICE AND

02:47:34.645 --> 02:47:38.081 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUSES.

02:47:36.847 --> 02:47:40.617 region:rollup2
I JOIN THE PROJECT IN TWO

02:47:38.081 --> 02:47:42.719 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THIRTEEN AS ITS LEADER.

02:47:40.617 --> 02:47:45.222 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT TIME WE PUT SYSTEM

02:47:42.719 --> 02:47:46.490 region:rollup2
OR SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT ON HOLD.

02:47:45.222 --> 02:47:47.991 region:rollup2
AND WE SPENT ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS

02:47:46.490 --> 02:47:48.926 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE CAMPUS IS TO

02:47:47.991 --> 02:47:50.827 region:rollup2
DEFINE OUR FUTURE STATE BUSINESS

02:47:48.926 --> 02:47:52.930 region:rollup2
PROCESSES.

02:47:50.827 --> 02:47:54.831 region:rollup2
HOW WERE WE GOING TO DO? ALL OF

02:47:52.930 --> 02:47:55.999 region:rollup2
THE FUNCTIONS OF YOU SEE PATH.

02:47:54.831 --> 02:47:57.167 region:rollup2
WHERE WOULD A PROCESS INITIATE

02:47:55.999 --> 02:47:58.402 region:rollup2
WHERE WITH THE HAND OFF TO THE

02:47:57.167 --> 02:48:00.137 region:rollup2
PATH CENTER BE?

02:47:58.402 --> 02:48:00.704 region:rollup2
IF WE NEEDED TO HEAD BACK TO

02:48:00.137 --> 02:48:01.772 region:rollup2
CAMPUS WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK

02:48:00.704 --> 02:48:02.372 region:rollup2
LIKE.

02:48:01.772 --> 02:48:03.874 region:rollup2
WE DID THAT FOR A HUNDRED AND

02:48:02.372 --> 02:48:05.842 region:rollup2
FIVE.

02:48:03.874 --> 02:48:08.178 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PROCESSES FROM HIRING

02:48:05.842 --> 02:48:09.413 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION TO.

02:48:08.178 --> 02:48:11.548 region:rollup2
TOP BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION AND

02:48:09.413 --> 02:48:13.717 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.

02:48:11.548 --> 02:48:15.118 region:rollup2
OUR AND WITH THAT CLARITY WE

02:48:13.717 --> 02:48:16.620 region:rollup2
COULD THEN GO BACK AND ACTUALLY

02:48:15.118 --> 02:48:19.089 region:rollup2
BE EFFECTIVE AT.

02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:20.157 region:rollup2
DOING THE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH A

02:48:19.089 --> 02:48:22.693 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THE SOFTWARE

02:48:20.157 --> 02:48:24.828 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF YOU SEE PATH.

02:48:22.693 --> 02:48:25.629 region:rollup2
ALSO DURING THAT TIME ONCE WE

02:48:24.828 --> 02:48:27.431 region:rollup2
HAD THE BUSINESS PROCESSES

02:48:25.629 --> 02:48:30.300 region:rollup2
DEFINED.

02:48:27.431 --> 02:48:32.069 region:rollup2
WE COULD THEN REALLY LOOK AT.

02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:33.570 region:rollup2
FINISHING THE PLANNING FOR

02:48:32.069 --> 02:48:35.305 region:rollup2
STAFFING UP THE PATH CENTER WE

02:48:33.570 --> 02:48:36.840 region:rollup2
OPEN AT THIRTEEN.

02:48:35.305 --> 02:48:38.175 region:rollup2
BUT IT WAS WITH A SKELETAL CREW

02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:39.943 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A A GROUP OF ABOUT

02:48:38.175 --> 02:48:41.111 region:rollup2
EIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST YEAR

02:48:39.943 --> 02:48:43.113 region:rollup2
AND A HALF AT THE CENTER BEFORE

02:48:41.111 --> 02:48:44.781 region:rollup2
WE REALLY STARTED HIRING PEOPLE.

02:48:43.113 --> 02:48:45.916 region:rollup2
ARE AND THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH

02:48:44.781 --> 02:48:47.250 region:rollup2
THE BUILD OUT OF THE FACILITY.

02:48:45.916 --> 02:48:48.518 region:rollup2
THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH THE

02:48:47.250 --> 02:48:50.120 region:rollup2
DESIGN OF THEIR COMPONENTS OF

02:48:48.518 --> 02:48:52.923 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:55.492 region:rollup2
BOB AND ARE YOU SEE ADMITS THAT

02:48:52.923 --> 02:48:56.927 region:rollup2
THE EARLY YEARS OF THE PROJECT

02:48:55.492 --> 02:48:57.828 region:rollup2
WERE CHALLENGING. ONCE WE

02:48:56.927 --> 02:48:59.096 region:rollup2
BROUGHT THE OFFICE OF THE

02:48:57.828 --> 02:49:01.465 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT LIVE.

02:48:59.096 --> 02:49:03.400 region:rollup2
WE REALLY HAD A PROOF OF

02:49:01.465 --> 02:49:05.202 region:rollup2
CONCEPT THAT. THIS NEW PAYROLL

02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:06.536 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WOULD WORK WE WERE USING

02:49:05.202 --> 02:49:08.872 region:rollup2
IT TO GENERATE PAYROLL FOR YOU

02:49:06.536 --> 02:49:10.707 region:rollup2
SEE EMPLOYEES. ALBEIT. VERY

02:49:08.872 --> 02:49:11.842 region:rollup2
SIMPLE KINDS OF PAYROLL BECAUSE

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:13.176 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE STAFF

02:49:11.842 --> 02:49:14.711 region:rollup2
AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.

02:49:13.176 --> 02:49:17.047 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ACADEMICS

02:49:14.711 --> 02:49:19.549 region:rollup2
STAFF EMPLOYEES.

02:49:17.047 --> 02:49:21.818 region:rollup2
NOT STUDENTS NOT NOT PHYSICIANS.

02:49:19.549 --> 02:49:23.353 region:rollup2
SO A RATHER STRAIGHTFORWARD

02:49:21.818 --> 02:49:25.188 region:rollup2
KIND OF PAYROLL.

02:49:23.353 --> 02:49:26.857 region:rollup2
A TWO YEARS BETWEEN THE OFFICE

02:49:25.188 --> 02:49:28.692 region:rollup2
OF THE PRESIDENT DEPLOYMENT.

02:49:26.857 --> 02:49:30.994 region:rollup2
AND B. DEPLOYMENT WE DID LAST

02:49:28.692 --> 02:49:32.596 region:rollup2
DECEMBER. WAS TIME THAT WE SPENT

02:49:30.994 --> 02:49:33.463 region:rollup2
REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE COULD

02:49:32.596 --> 02:49:35.966 region:rollup2
HANDLE THE COMPLEXITY OF

02:49:33.463 --> 02:49:38.602 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC PAYROLL.

02:49:35.966 --> 02:49:39.336 region:rollup2
BOB YOU HEARD UP THROUGH SOME OF

02:49:38.602 --> 02:49:40.771 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS.

02:49:39.336 --> 02:49:42.606 region:rollup2
FOR HER IN EARLIER

02:49:40.771 --> 02:49:44.141 region:rollup2
PRESENTATIONS TODAY. ABOUT SOME

02:49:42.606 --> 02:49:45.942 region:rollup2
OF THE COMPLEXITY OF YOU SEE AND

02:49:44.141 --> 02:49:47.411 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES

02:49:45.942 --> 02:49:49.279 region:rollup2
PAYROLL ANY RESEARCH INTERESTS

02:49:47.411 --> 02:49:51.214 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION SO COMPLEX.

02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:53.583 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT ANY GIVEN FACULTY

02:49:51.214 --> 02:49:56.119 region:rollup2
MEMBER CAN HAVE UPWARDS OF THREE

02:49:53.583 --> 02:49:57.921 region:rollup2
TO FOUR DOZEN GRANTS.

02:49:56.119 --> 02:49:59.423 region:rollup2
THAT THEY USED TO PAY BOTH

02:49:57.921 --> 02:50:00.057 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES THEIR RESEARCH

02:49:59.423 --> 02:50:01.658 region:rollup2
ASSISTANTS AND THEY'RE TEACHING

02:50:00.057 --> 02:50:03.026 region:rollup2
ASSIST.

02:50:01.658 --> 02:50:05.429 region:rollup2
AND SO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE

02:50:03.026 --> 02:50:07.197 region:rollup2
RESEARCH FUNDS.

02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:08.799 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY SINGLE PAYROLL. CAN

02:50:07.197 --> 02:50:10.834 region:rollup2
VARY FROM PAY PERIOD TO PAY

02:50:08.799 --> 02:50:11.968 region:rollup2
PERIOD. AND THE SYSTEM HAS TO BE

02:50:10.834 --> 02:50:13.437 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT SO

02:50:11.968 --> 02:50:15.272 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

02:50:13.437 --> 02:50:17.007 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OUT IN A WAY THAT ASSURED

02:50:15.272 --> 02:50:18.475 region:rollup2
ARE ACADEMICS THAT WE COULD DO

02:50:17.007 --> 02:50:20.544 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC PAY CORRECTLY.

02:50:18.475 --> 02:50:21.978 region:rollup2
TOOK THAT AMOUNT OF TIME.

02:50:20.544 --> 02:50:24.247 region:rollup2
AND MOST OF THAT TIME WAS SPENT

02:50:21.978 --> 02:50:26.249 region:rollup2
IN TESTING TO MAKE SURE IT WAS

02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:28.418 region:rollup2
WITHIN TOLERANCES AND FOR US

02:50:26.249 --> 02:50:29.419 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS PAY HAD COME WITHIN.

02:50:28.418 --> 02:50:30.821 region:rollup2
FIVE SENSE OF WHAT WE EXPECTED

02:50:29.419 --> 02:50:32.756 region:rollup2
IT TO BE.

02:50:30.821 --> 02:50:35.125 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE MET THOSE THRESHOLDS

02:50:32.756 --> 02:50:36.760 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOW LIVE WITH ACADEMICS.

02:50:35.125 --> 02:50:38.095 region:rollup2
IN REALLY THE WORK THAT'S

02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:39.596 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMAINING

02:50:38.095 --> 02:50:41.465 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENTS FOR PATH.

02:50:39.596 --> 02:50:43.533 region:rollup2
IS MORE ABOUT.

02:50:41.465 --> 02:50:45.202 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT WE CONVERT LEGACY

02:50:43.533 --> 02:50:46.670 region:rollup2
RECORDS FOR EMPLOYEES AND LESS

02:50:45.202 --> 02:50:47.804 region:rollup2
ABOUT BUILDING SOFTWARE TO DO

02:50:46.670 --> 02:50:49.973 region:rollup2
THE PAYROLL ITSELF WERE DONE

02:50:47.804 --> 02:50:51.141 region:rollup2
WITH THE BUILD FACE.

02:50:49.973 --> 02:50:53.110 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON

02:50:51.141 --> 02:50:55.011 region:rollup2
SIMPLY TRANSITIONING EMPLOYEES

02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:56.246 region:rollup2
FROM THE OLD SYSTEM TO THE NEW.

02:50:55.011 --> 02:50:58.081 region:rollup2
SO IT WAS A SLOW START AND WE

02:50:56.246 --> 02:50:58.882 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

02:50:58.081 --> 02:51:00.717 region:rollup2
AND WE AND WE MADE EARLY

02:50:58.882 --> 02:51:02.519 region:rollup2
MISTAKES.

02:51:00.717 --> 02:51:03.153 region:rollup2
BUT WERE AND A POINT THE PROJECT

02:51:02.519 --> 02:51:05.589 region:rollup2
NOW WHERE.

02:51:03.153 --> 02:51:07.557 region:rollup2
IT'S A MUCH MORE DEFINED SET OF

02:51:05.589 --> 02:51:10.627 region:rollup2
PROCESSES THAT WE'RE PURSUING.

02:51:07.557 --> 02:51:11.428 region:rollup2
AND OUR ABILITY TO.

02:51:10.627 --> 02:51:12.362 region:rollup2
GET TO THE END OF THE PROJECT.

02:51:11.428 --> 02:51:13.764 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE MUCH HIGHER

02:51:12.362 --> 02:51:15.465 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE THAT WILL MAKE IT

02:51:13.764 --> 02:51:16.533 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE REMAINING BUDGET. AND

02:51:15.465 --> 02:51:18.335 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE TIMELINE THAT WE'VE

02:51:16.533 --> 02:51:19.636 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED.

02:51:18.335 --> 02:51:21.371 region:rollup2
IT IF I COULD DO IS THE

02:51:19.636 --> 02:51:24.274 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S HAVE.

02:51:21.371 --> 02:51:26.076 region:rollup2
ANY INFORMATION ON HOW MUCH

02:51:24.274 --> 02:51:28.979 region:rollup2
MORE IT COSTS.

02:51:26.076 --> 02:51:31.014 region:rollup2
THAN WAS ORIGINALLY PROJECTED.

02:51:28.979 --> 02:51:32.949 region:rollup2
TO TO PHASE AND TWO TO DO THIS

02:51:31.014 --> 02:51:33.984 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE FROM. A DECENTRALIZED

02:51:32.949 --> 02:51:36.319 region:rollup2
PROCESS

02:51:33.984 --> 02:51:38.054 region:rollup2
TO WHAT.

02:51:36.319 --> 02:51:42.759 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE A COST SAVING.

02:51:38.054 --> 02:51:45.462 region:rollup2
A PROCESS BY CENTRALIZING HOW

02:51:42.759 --> 02:51:47.731 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE AS A COSTS THAN WAS

02:51:45.462 --> 02:51:49.599 region:rollup2
FIRST ESTIMATED.

02:51:47.731 --> 02:51:50.567 region:rollup2
ANYWAY I DO HAVE SOME OF THAT

02:51:49.599 --> 02:51:52.302 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:51:50.567 --> 02:51:52.869 region:rollup2
NOT AT MY FINGERTIPS I'D BE

02:51:52.302 --> 02:51:54.471 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR

02:51:52.869 --> 02:51:56.072 region:rollup2
STAFF ON THAT.

02:51:54.471 --> 02:51:57.974 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK GENERALLY ONE OF

02:51:56.072 --> 02:51:59.543 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES HERE IS THAT I'M

02:51:57.974 --> 02:52:02.145 region:rollup2
AS AS YOU SEE INDICATED THIS WAS

02:51:59.543 --> 02:52:03.613 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY. PRESENTED TO THE

02:52:02.145 --> 02:52:05.015 region:rollup2
REGION'S AS A WAY TO SORT OF.

02:52:03.613 --> 02:52:06.249 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SAVE COSTS THE IDEA WAS

02:52:05.015 --> 02:52:08.051 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SEE PATH WOULD TAKE

02:52:06.249 --> 02:52:09.619 region:rollup2
OVER A LOT OF SERVICES PAYROLL

02:52:08.051 --> 02:52:12.022 region:rollup2
SERVICES OTHER TYPES OF.

02:52:09.619 --> 02:52:12.989 region:rollup2
HUMAN RESOURCE SERVICES THAT

02:52:12.022 --> 02:52:13.790 region:rollup2
THAT CAMPUSES WERE CURRENTLY

02:52:12.989 --> 02:52:15.158 region:rollup2
DOING AND SO THAT WOULD RESULT

02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:16.793 region:rollup2
IN SOME STAFF SAVINGS.

02:52:15.158 --> 02:52:17.694 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT CHANGED CAMPUSES

02:52:16.793 --> 02:52:19.796 region:rollup2
ARE NOW INDICATING THAT.

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:21.198 region:rollup2
.

02:52:19.796 --> 02:52:22.866 region:rollup2
THEY AREN'T REALLY.

02:52:21.198 --> 02:52:25.101 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T PRETTY PROJECT TO BE

02:52:22.866 --> 02:52:26.236 region:rollup2
ABLE SERVING HER THOSE SAVINGS

02:52:25.101 --> 02:52:27.904 region:rollup2
ITS MORE ABOUT US SERVE COST

02:52:26.236 --> 02:52:29.439 region:rollup2
AVOIDANCE AND I I HAVEN'T SEEN

02:52:27.904 --> 02:52:30.607 region:rollup2
ANY SORT OF QUANTIFICATION OF

02:52:29.439 --> 02:52:32.008 region:rollup2
THAT SORT OF COST OF WHEN IT'S

02:52:30.607 --> 02:52:32.709 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD.

02:52:32.008 --> 02:52:34.477 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S SORT OF ONE

02:52:32.709 --> 02:52:36.279 region:rollup2
QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS

02:52:34.477 --> 02:52:38.949 region:rollup2
IT CONSIDERS THIS PROPOSAL IS. A

02:52:36.279 --> 02:52:41.218 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT IT IT AGREES THAT

02:52:38.949 --> 02:52:42.152 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES CANNOT SORT OF IDENTIFY

02:52:41.218 --> 02:52:43.453 region:rollup2
THOSE SAVINGS WITH AND THERE'S

02:52:42.152 --> 02:52:45.322 region:rollup2
BUT DIDN'T WITHIN THOSE BUDGETS

02:52:43.453 --> 02:52:47.023 region:rollup2
AND. AND IT CAN'T CAN'T ACTUALLY

02:52:45.322 --> 02:52:49.326 region:rollup2
SERVING GATE WITH YOU SEE PATH

02:52:47.023 --> 02:52:50.861 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT SERVER REVISITS

02:52:49.326 --> 02:52:51.428 region:rollup2
THE CONSTRUCTS IN RIVERS THAT

02:52:50.861 --> 02:52:53.129 region:rollup2
SORT OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE

02:52:51.428 --> 02:52:54.531 region:rollup2
COSTS.

02:52:53.129 --> 02:52:55.699 region:rollup2
I THINK I DESERVE ONE QUESTION

02:52:54.531 --> 02:52:56.833 region:rollup2
FACING THE LEGISLATURE ARE ARE

02:52:55.699 --> 02:52:58.501 region:rollup2
ARE YOU SAYING IT WON'T BE.

02:52:56.833 --> 02:52:59.569 region:rollup2
BUT COST SAVINGS.

02:52:58.501 --> 02:53:00.437 region:rollup2
FOR ARE UNDERSTANDING BASED ON

02:52:59.569 --> 02:53:01.071 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU SEE HAS PRESENTED IS

02:53:00.437 --> 02:53:02.839 region:rollup2
THAT A LOT OF THE INITIAL COST

02:53:01.071 --> 02:53:05.609 region:rollup2
SAVINGS THAT WERE PROJECTED.

02:53:02.839 --> 02:53:08.712 region:rollup2
WHERE OUT SOMEWHAT OVER

02:53:05.609 --> 02:53:09.512 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS TODAY TODAY THAT YOU

02:53:08.712 --> 02:53:10.814 region:rollup2
SEE IN THIS CASE THAT IT'S A

02:53:09.512 --> 02:53:11.815 region:rollup2
MORE OF A COST AVOIDANCE NOT?

02:53:10.814 --> 02:53:13.216 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE INITIAL COST SAVINGS

02:53:11.815 --> 02:53:13.783 region:rollup2
THAT WERE INITIALLY PROJECTED

02:53:13.216 --> 02:53:15.685 region:rollup2
WHEN IT WAS PRESENTED TO THE

02:53:13.783 --> 02:53:17.287 region:rollup2
REGENTS.

02:53:15.685 --> 02:53:19.522 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN IT'S A AT CAPACITY IN

02:53:17.287 --> 02:53:20.924 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WILL IT

02:53:19.522 --> 02:53:24.361 region:rollup2
COST YOU SEE LESS.

02:53:20.924 --> 02:53:25.962 region:rollup2
TO RUN OPERATE.

02:53:24.361 --> 02:53:27.497 region:rollup2
SO MR MEDINA WE WE DOCUMENTED

02:53:25.962 --> 02:53:29.432 region:rollup2
THE

02:53:27.497 --> 02:53:31.101 region:rollup2
COST OF DELIVERY OF THESE KINDS

02:53:29.432 --> 02:53:33.336 region:rollup2
OF SERVICES.

02:53:31.101 --> 02:53:35.338 region:rollup2
OUR IT TWO POINTS IN THE PAST WE

02:53:33.336 --> 02:53:36.706 region:rollup2
DID UP A MAJOR INITIATIVE WITH

02:53:35.338 --> 02:53:38.475 region:rollup2
PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPERS IN YOUR

02:53:36.706 --> 02:53:39.776 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND. AND WE FOLLOWED

02:53:38.475 --> 02:53:41.711 region:rollup2
THAT UP IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND

02:53:39.776 --> 02:53:44.447 region:rollup2
TEN UNDERSTAND.

02:53:41.711 --> 02:53:45.115 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY AN F. T. E. LEVEL.

02:53:44.447 --> 02:53:46.916 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE

02:53:45.115 --> 02:53:49.019 region:rollup2
DELIVERY OF THE SERVICES?

02:53:46.916 --> 02:53:51.087 region:rollup2
BOB AND IN SOME OF THOSE

02:53:49.019 --> 02:53:52.856 region:rollup2
OF REPORTS.

02:53:51.087 --> 02:53:55.992 region:rollup2
ARE THERE WERE NUMBERS THAT

02:53:52.856 --> 02:53:57.727 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED OF AREAS WHERE. YOU

02:53:55.992 --> 02:54:00.263 region:rollup2
SEE WAS.

02:53:57.727 --> 02:54:02.899 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN A LOT OF WASTEFUL

02:54:00.263 --> 02:54:05.101 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY IN THE RE WORK.

02:54:02.899 --> 02:54:06.936 region:rollup2
PAYROLL RELATED ACTIVITIES.

02:54:05.101 --> 02:54:09.839 region:rollup2
IN THE TWO THOUSAND TEN.

02:54:06.936 --> 02:54:11.341 region:rollup2
REPORT FROM PWC THE IDENTIFIED

02:54:09.839 --> 02:54:13.209 region:rollup2
UP TO A HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR.

02:54:11.341 --> 02:54:15.412 region:rollup2
OF RE WORK COSTS

02:54:13.209 --> 02:54:17.948 region:rollup2
FOR MISTAKES IN PAYROLL.

02:54:15.412 --> 02:54:19.215 region:rollup2
SO. GUY I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT

02:54:17.948 --> 02:54:21.685 region:rollup2
THE COMPLEXITY OF ACADEMIC.

02:54:19.215 --> 02:54:23.386 region:rollup2
PAY ALLOCATING RESEARCH GRANTS

02:54:21.685 --> 02:54:25.088 region:rollup2
TO TO PAY.

02:54:23.386 --> 02:54:26.423 region:rollup2
ARE IS A HIGHLY MANUAL TASK

02:54:25.088 --> 02:54:29.392 region:rollup2
WHICH WE HAVE NOW ARE

02:54:26.423 --> 02:54:31.361 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY AUTOMATED IMPASSE.

02:54:29.392 --> 02:54:32.595 region:rollup2
THAT MANUAL WORK RESULTED IN A

02:54:31.361 --> 02:54:34.364 region:rollup2
LOT OF REWORKED BECAUSE THERE

02:54:32.595 --> 02:54:36.166 region:rollup2
WAS A LOT OF ERRORS IN IT.

02:54:34.364 --> 02:54:38.335 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS THE REDUCTION OF

02:54:36.166 --> 02:54:39.636 region:rollup2
REWORK EXPENSE.

02:54:38.335 --> 02:54:41.171 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK BY WAY OF

02:54:39.636 --> 02:54:43.173 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATION IF I MIGHT I'D LIKE

02:54:41.171 --> 02:54:45.075 region:rollup2
TO SHARE WITH YOU. OF THE

02:54:43.173 --> 02:54:46.042 region:rollup2
STRATEGY THAT'S IN PLAY AT THE

02:54:45.075 --> 02:54:48.011 region:rollup2
RIVERSIDE CAMPUS.

02:54:46.042 --> 02:54:49.145 region:rollup2
AS YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IN HEARING

02:54:48.011 --> 02:54:50.213 region:rollup2
TODAY.

02:54:49.145 --> 02:54:52.182 region:rollup2
THEY ARE GROWING THEIR SCHOOL

02:54:50.213 --> 02:54:53.183 region:rollup2
OF MEDICINE ALONG WITH OTHER

02:54:52.182 --> 02:54:55.418 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS OF THEIR ACADEMIC

02:54:53.183 --> 02:54:58.355 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:54:55.418 --> 02:55:00.590 region:rollup2
CHANCER WILCOX HAS IDENTIFIED A

02:54:58.355 --> 02:55:02.659 region:rollup2
RATHER AGGRESSIVE GROWTH POSTURE

02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:03.793 region:rollup2
FOR THAT CAMPUS WANTING TO GROW

02:55:02.659 --> 02:55:04.794 region:rollup2
ELEVEN PERCENT IN THEIR ACADEMIC

02:55:03.793 --> 02:55:06.062 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OVER THE NEXT FIVE

02:55:04.794 --> 02:55:07.797 region:rollup2
YEARS.

02:55:06.062 --> 02:55:09.699 region:rollup2
UP WITH THE RESTRICTION THAT

02:55:07.797 --> 02:55:11.267 region:rollup2
THEY GROW THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE

02:55:09.699 --> 02:55:13.703 region:rollup2
COSTS BY ONLY ONE PERCENT OVER

02:55:11.267 --> 02:55:16.473 region:rollup2
THAT SAME PERIOD.

02:55:13.703 --> 02:55:18.208 region:rollup2
UC PATH IS A CORNERSTONE OF THAT

02:55:16.473 --> 02:55:19.909 region:rollup2
STRATEGY TO LIMIT ADMINISTRATIVE

02:55:18.208 --> 02:55:20.477 region:rollup2
COST GROWTH.

02:55:19.909 --> 02:55:23.013 region:rollup2
AS THEY GROW THEIR ACADEMIC

02:55:20.477 --> 02:55:24.948 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:55:23.013 --> 02:55:26.583 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT SEEN AS A. COST

02:55:24.948 --> 02:55:28.051 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS SO MUCH AS IT IS A

02:55:26.583 --> 02:55:29.552 region:rollup2
LIMITER.

02:55:28.051 --> 02:55:31.821 region:rollup2
ON THE GROWTH OF ADMINISTRATIVE

02:55:29.552 --> 02:55:33.556 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR THE CAMPUSES.

02:55:31.821 --> 02:55:34.124 region:rollup2
WE WILL BE PROVIDING THIS CORE

02:55:33.556 --> 02:55:36.259 region:rollup2
SET OF SERVICES IN A DEFINED

02:55:34.124 --> 02:55:37.560 region:rollup2
WAY.

02:55:36.259 --> 02:55:38.895 region:rollup2
WE'RE REDUCING VARIABILITY IN

02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:40.797 region:rollup2
THOUGH SERVICES WERE BRINGING

02:55:38.895 --> 02:55:42.866 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY THROUGH SCALE.

02:55:40.797 --> 02:55:44.868 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REDUCE

02:55:42.866 --> 02:55:47.670 region:rollup2
OVERALL COSTS BUT IT CERTAINLY

02:55:44.868 --> 02:55:49.539 region:rollup2
ALLOWS US UP TO PUT CAPS ON ANY

02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:50.006 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN THOSE THOSE EXPENSES.

02:55:49.539 --> 02:55:52.475 region:rollup2
AND AS WE FINISH THIS

02:55:50.006 --> 02:55:54.844 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENT.

02:55:52.475 --> 02:55:57.380 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE A BASE WHERE WE HAVE

02:55:54.844 --> 02:55:59.549 region:rollup2
ALL CAMPUS IS USING A STANDARD

02:55:57.380 --> 02:56:02.352 region:rollup2
SET OF BUSINESS PRACTICES.

02:55:59.549 --> 02:56:02.886 region:rollup2
THAT BOB FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OUR

02:56:02.352 --> 02:56:04.754 region:rollup2
THE PREREQUISITE DEFINING

02:56:02.886 --> 02:56:05.388 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES.

02:56:04.754 --> 02:56:07.123 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GET TO EFFICIENCIES IF

02:56:05.388 --> 02:56:07.757 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T STANDARDIZE AND WHAT

02:56:07.123 --> 02:56:09.025 region:rollup2
WE WILL HAVE DONE INITIALLY WITH

02:56:07.757 --> 02:56:10.393 region:rollup2
PATH.

02:56:09.025 --> 02:56:11.895 region:rollup2
IS TO STANDARDIZE THE WAY WE

02:56:10.393 --> 02:56:12.962 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE SERVICES WITH THE

02:56:11.895 --> 02:56:14.697 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION AND.

02:56:12.962 --> 02:56:15.365 region:rollup2
THAT THE CAMPUSES ARE GOING TO

02:56:14.697 --> 02:56:17.333 region:rollup2
BE.

02:56:15.365 --> 02:56:18.635 region:rollup2
PUTTING SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON

02:56:17.333 --> 02:56:20.303 region:rollup2
US TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING IT

02:56:18.635 --> 02:56:21.805 region:rollup2
AT THE LOWEST UNIT COST AND

02:56:20.303 --> 02:56:24.407 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PREPARING FOR

02:56:21.805 --> 02:56:26.309 region:rollup2
ONCE WE GET THROUGH THE PROJECT.

02:56:24.407 --> 02:56:27.043 region:rollup2
SO IT'S BEEN ROUGH TO GET THERE.

02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:28.578 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE BUILT A GREAT

02:56:27.043 --> 02:56:30.113 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION AND I WOULD OBSERVE

02:56:28.578 --> 02:56:31.548 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THIS FOUNDATION WE CAN

02:56:30.113 --> 02:56:32.949 region:rollup2
ALSO THEN LEVERAGE THAT INITIAL

02:56:31.548 --> 02:56:33.683 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

02:56:32.949 --> 02:56:34.684 region:rollup2
TO TAKE ON OTHER ADDITIONAL

02:56:33.683 --> 02:56:37.153 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

02:56:34.684 --> 02:56:39.556 region:rollup2
SUCH AS.

02:56:37.153 --> 02:56:41.758 region:rollup2
ABOUT TODAY EACH CAMPUS.

02:56:39.556 --> 02:56:43.693 region:rollup2
HANDLES TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT.

02:56:41.758 --> 02:56:46.563 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN WAY. IN TYPICALLY

02:56:43.693 --> 02:56:47.464 region:rollup2
THROUGH ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.

02:56:46.563 --> 02:56:49.466 region:rollup2
WELL IF WE'VE GOT THE PATH

02:56:47.464 --> 02:56:51.401 region:rollup2
CENTER AND WE NOW HAVE A PAYROLL

02:56:49.466 --> 02:56:52.836 region:rollup2
OPERATION IN PLACE TODAY.

02:56:51.401 --> 02:56:54.804 region:rollup2
WE COULD SIMPLY MOVE THAT

02:56:52.836 --> 02:56:56.539 region:rollup2
SERVICE TO THE PATH CENTER.

02:56:54.804 --> 02:56:58.007 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT

02:56:56.539 --> 02:57:00.009 region:rollup2
AS A NON TAXABLE INCOME

02:56:58.007 --> 02:57:01.411 region:rollup2
COMPONENT FOR THEIR PAYCHECK.

02:57:00.009 --> 02:57:03.179 region:rollup2
IT REDUCES OVERHEAD AT THE

02:57:01.411 --> 02:57:03.746 region:rollup2
CAMPUS IN AT LEVERAGES THE

02:57:03.179 --> 02:57:04.948 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT WE'VE MADE IT THE

02:57:03.746 --> 02:57:06.182 region:rollup2
PATH CENTER.

02:57:04.948 --> 02:57:07.183 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:57:06.182 --> 02:57:08.918 region:rollup2
FUTURE SHARED SERVICES THROUGH

02:57:07.183 --> 02:57:10.753 region:rollup2
THE PATH CENTER.

02:57:08.918 --> 02:57:11.454 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE TO EXECUTE FINISH

02:57:10.753 --> 02:57:13.256 region:rollup2
EXECUTING ON THE PROJECT

02:57:11.454 --> 02:57:14.724 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THIS.

02:57:13.256 --> 02:57:15.291 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN BEGIN TO IND THOSE

02:57:14.724 --> 02:57:16.493 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES IN THOSE POINTS

02:57:15.291 --> 02:57:17.060 region:rollup2
SCALE.

02:57:16.493 --> 02:57:18.695 region:rollup2
AND I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR

02:57:17.060 --> 02:57:20.230 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:57:18.695 --> 02:57:20.697 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T I AND I WOULD SAY

02:57:20.230 --> 02:57:22.932 region:rollup2
THAT I APPRECIATE THE

02:57:20.697 --> 02:57:24.734 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY.

02:57:22.932 --> 02:57:26.369 region:rollup2
ARE I'M A LITTLE BIT TAKEN BACK

02:57:24.734 --> 02:57:28.338 region:rollup2
BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IS

02:57:26.369 --> 02:57:29.939 region:rollup2
TAKEN TO GET THERE.

02:57:28.338 --> 02:57:32.008 region:rollup2
AND NUMBER MEDINA I APOLOGIZE I

02:57:29.939 --> 02:57:34.010 region:rollup2
I DO HAVE A THERE IS A RECENT

02:57:32.008 --> 02:57:35.211 region:rollup2
AUDIT OF YOU SEE PATH AND IT

02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:36.679 region:rollup2
DOES PROVIDE THE DATA THAT YOU

ASKED FOR YOU LAST FOR. HOURS

02:57:36.679 --> 02:57:39.883 region:rollup2
THE COST ESTIMATE CHANGED OVER

REGENTS ACCORDING TO THE

02:57:49.058 --> 02:57:51.928 region:rollup2
AUDITOR.

PROJECT COSTS.

02:57:58.468 --> 02:58:00.103 region:rollup2
I'M IN THE ESTIMATED SAVINGS OF

A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

02:58:02.505 --> 02:58:04.307 region:rollup2
DOLLARS MOST OF THE SAVINGS

02:58:03.773 --> 02:58:05.108 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SORT OF STAFFING

02:58:04.307 --> 02:58:06.409 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS.

THE ACTIVITY THAT YOU'D BE

03:00:49.972 --> 03:00:53.976 region:rollup2
DOING.

03:00:52.442 --> 03:00:55.244 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT CONNECTOR TO BASE

03:00:53.976 --> 03:00:56.879 region:rollup2
MODEL.

03:00:55.244 --> 03:00:58.948 region:rollup2
IS SO YOU YOU WOULD BE LOOKING

03:00:56.879 --> 03:01:02.285 region:rollup2
AT OTHER.

03:00:58.948 --> 03:01:04.020 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THE UC DOES.

03:01:02.285 --> 03:01:05.221 region:rollup2
TO REDEFINE THEIR BUSINESS

03:01:04.020 --> 03:01:07.657 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THAT YOU'VE JUST LAID

03:01:05.221 --> 03:01:10.193 region:rollup2
OUT HERE.

03:01:07.657 --> 03:01:11.427 region:rollup2
TO FIND SAVINGS AND I DO HOPE

03:01:10.193 --> 03:01:12.195 region:rollup2
ALL INTENT WE DOING THIS WAS TO

03:01:11.427 --> 03:01:14.263 region:rollup2
PUT.

03:01:12.195 --> 03:01:15.264 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY IN THE EDUCATION OF

03:01:14.263 --> 03:01:15.631 region:rollup2
THE CHILD OTHER STUDENTS AND

03:01:15.264 --> 03:01:18.601 region:rollup2
LESS MONEY AND.

03:01:15.631 --> 03:01:19.235 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES.

03:01:18.601 --> 03:01:20.236 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE WANTED YOU AS YOU

03:01:19.235 --> 03:01:22.905 region:rollup2
DO IN THE FIRST PLACE.

03:01:20.236 --> 03:01:26.242 region:rollup2
SO.

03:01:22.905 --> 03:01:27.510 region:rollup2
I'M SOMEWHAT CONCERNED.

03:01:26.242 --> 03:01:28.111 region:rollup2
AS A MEMBER WHO'S BEEN A FOR SIX

03:01:27.510 --> 03:01:38.321 region:rollup2
YEARS THEN YOU JUST. BRIEF AN

03:01:28.111 --> 03:01:39.689 region:rollup2
ENTIRE

03:01:38.321 --> 03:01:42.358 region:rollup2
PROJECT DISCUSS KNOWS.

03:01:39.689 --> 03:01:43.760 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

03:01:42.358 --> 03:01:46.195 region:rollup2
AND YOU DID A LINE THE TWO

03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:47.063 region:rollup2
TOGETHER SO THAT MAKES ME THINK.

03:01:46.195 --> 03:01:49.799 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEBODY IT UC'S JUST

03:01:47.063 --> 03:01:50.433 region:rollup2
SMILING AT ME. AND NOT REALLY.

03:01:49.799 --> 03:01:52.101 region:rollup2
TAKING SOMETHIN THAT COULD HELP

03:01:50.433 --> 03:01:54.604 region:rollup2
THEM.

03:01:52.101 --> 03:01:59.108 region:rollup2
TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING.

03:01:54.604 --> 03:02:00.476 region:rollup2
AM I THINK I'M WRONG.

03:01:59.108 --> 03:02:01.544 region:rollup2
CHAVEZ I BELIEVE THE THE YOU SEE

03:02:00.476 --> 03:02:03.045 region:rollup2
IS.

03:02:01.544 --> 03:02:04.914 region:rollup2
LIKE ALL LARGE INSTITUTIONS NOT

03:02:03.045 --> 03:02:07.083 region:rollup2
ALL COMPONENTS SPEAK EQUALLY

03:02:04.914 --> 03:02:08.518 region:rollup2
WELL WITH EACH OTHER. I HAVE

03:02:07.083 --> 03:02:10.520 region:rollup2
HEARD AND HAVE FOLLOWED THE

03:02:08.518 --> 03:02:11.788 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY BASED COSTING.

03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:13.256 region:rollup2
PILOT WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN

03:02:11.788 --> 03:02:14.724 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF CAMPUSES.

03:02:13.256 --> 03:02:16.893 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO OBSERVE THAT YOU

03:02:14.724 --> 03:02:19.495 region:rollup2
SEE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK

03:02:16.893 --> 03:02:22.231 region:rollup2
STRATEGICALLY ABOUT ITS DATA.

03:02:19.495 --> 03:02:24.233 region:rollup2
AND HISTORICALLY YOU SEE DATA

03:02:22.231 --> 03:02:25.034 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN LOOKED AT. A IN A

03:02:24.233 --> 03:02:26.235 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS THERE

03:02:25.034 --> 03:02:29.906 region:rollup2
IS STOVE PIPED.

03:02:26.235 --> 03:02:32.008 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH SO I KNOW THAT OKAY.

03:02:29.906 --> 03:02:32.575 region:rollup2
I ARE IT WAS ALREADY THERE I I

03:02:32.008 --> 03:02:35.945 region:rollup2
WON'T BELABOR THE OBVIOUS SO

03:02:32.575 --> 03:02:38.381 region:rollup2
THE.

03:02:35.945 --> 03:02:41.284 region:rollup2
.

03:02:38.381 --> 03:02:42.118 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU COULD TAKE THIS BACK

03:02:41.284 --> 03:02:44.554 region:rollup2
AT THE LONGER BE GONTIER TO

03:02:42.118 --> 03:02:48.324 region:rollup2
ABOUT ME.

03:02:44.554 --> 03:02:49.258 region:rollup2
AND THE NEXT TIME

03:02:48.324 --> 03:02:49.892 region:rollup2
ABILITY KNOWN ACTIVITY BASED

03:02:49.258 --> 03:02:51.294 region:rollup2
COSTING AS

03:02:49.892 --> 03:02:54.463 region:rollup2
BUT THE IF

03:02:51.294 --> 03:02:55.598 region:rollup2
IF YOU CARED AT THE UC SYSTEM IN

03:02:54.463 --> 03:02:57.900 region:rollup2
THE PAST. AND YOU CAN ONLY DO

03:02:55.598 --> 03:02:58.468 region:rollup2
THIS OF IT COMES FROM THE

03:02:57.900 --> 03:02:59.936 region:rollup2
REGION'S ALL THE WAY DOWN.

03:02:58.468 --> 03:03:00.803 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO.

03:02:59.936 --> 03:03:02.471 region:rollup2
EMBRACE SOMETHING THAT WE TEACH

03:03:00.803 --> 03:03:04.073 region:rollup2
AT OUR BUSINESS SCHOOLS

03:03:02.471 --> 03:03:05.408 region:rollup2
AT THE UC SYSTEM.

03:03:04.073 --> 03:03:06.209 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A ROCKY CHAVEZ SAYING

03:03:05.408 --> 03:03:08.845 region:rollup2
THAT YOU GET YOUR BUSINESS

03:03:06.209 --> 03:03:10.179 region:rollup2
MODELS ARE BEING TAUGHT YEARS

03:03:08.845 --> 03:03:11.914 region:rollup2
YOUR SCHOOLS WHEN YOU GIVE

03:03:10.179 --> 03:03:13.449 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY AN MBA.

03:03:11.914 --> 03:03:14.550 region:rollup2
UNDER THE UC SYSTEM THEY'RE

03:03:13.449 --> 03:03:15.218 region:rollup2
GOING TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT AN

03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:15.751 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY BASED COSTING MODEL IS.

03:03:15.218 --> 03:03:16.385 region:rollup2
SO YOU TEACH IT.

03:03:15.751 --> 03:03:16.786 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO NOT WANT TO PRACTICE

03:03:16.385 --> 03:03:18.454 region:rollup2
IT.

03:03:16.786 --> 03:03:20.590 region:rollup2
IN OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

03:03:18.454 --> 03:03:22.458 region:rollup2
THOUGH YOU CAN JUST GO WILL OUT

03:03:20.590 --> 03:03:23.359 region:rollup2
ACTED BASED CASA EDUCATIONS

03:03:22.458 --> 03:03:24.961 region:rollup2
DELUSIONS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A

03:03:23.359 --> 03:03:25.294 region:rollup2
SERIES OF UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS

03:03:24.961 --> 03:03:25.461 region:rollup2
THAT DO THAT.

03:03:25.294 --> 03:03:26.062 region:rollup2
SO.

03:03:25.461 --> 03:03:27.463 region:rollup2
.

03:03:26.062 --> 03:03:28.564 region:rollup2
BUT IT ONLY WORKS

03:03:27.463 --> 03:03:29.899 region:rollup2
YOU CAN READ THOSE TWO.

03:03:28.564 --> 03:03:31.701 region:rollup2
IF AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

03:03:29.899 --> 03:03:33.069 region:rollup2
EMBRACED AS A VISION FOR THE TOP

03:03:31.701 --> 03:03:35.004 region:rollup2
DOWN SO YOU DON'T HAVE STILL

03:03:33.069 --> 03:03:36.239 region:rollup2
PIPES.

03:03:35.004 --> 03:03:37.773 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ALL STOVE PIPES ARE

03:03:36.239 --> 03:03:39.375 region:rollup2
INHERENTLY INEFFICIENT.

03:03:37.773 --> 03:03:40.476 region:rollup2
AND YOU NEED TO BREAK THEM DOWN

03:03:39.375 --> 03:03:42.478 region:rollup2
SO THAT YOU HAVE AS YOU SAID

03:03:40.476 --> 03:03:45.615 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY HER EARLIER. HOW DO

03:03:42.478 --> 03:03:47.617 region:rollup2
YOU SHARE?

03:03:45.615 --> 03:03:49.018 region:rollup2
FIRST I YOU HAD TO COMMON TERMS

03:03:47.617 --> 03:03:50.152 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO YOU SHARE THE DATA

03:03:49.018 --> 03:03:50.887 region:rollup2
FROM THIS COME TO TERMS.

03:03:50.152 --> 03:03:52.288 region:rollup2
TO FIND THE.

03:03:50.887 --> 03:03:52.922 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE MONEY

03:03:52.288 --> 03:03:55.224 region:rollup2
WHICH WERE TRYING TO DO IN THIS

03:03:52.922 --> 03:03:57.627 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

03:03:55.224 --> 03:03:58.928 region:rollup2
SO. IF YOU CARRY THAT MESSAGE

03:03:57.627 --> 03:04:01.631 region:rollup2
BACK LIKE I SAID I'LL BE GONE.

03:03:58.928 --> 03:04:03.332 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED TO BE

03:04:01.631 --> 03:04:04.967 region:rollup2
GOING FOR THIS AND I THINK OKAY.

03:04:03.332 --> 03:04:07.603 region:rollup2
THANK YOU GUYS SING NO MORE

03:04:04.967 --> 03:04:08.871 region:rollup2

OF THIS SO.

03:04:56.485 --> 03:05:00.590 region:rollup2
YOU SEE PATH THAT WOULD RETURN.

03:04:59.355 --> 03:05:02.191 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING ALLOCATION OF

03:05:00.590 --> 03:05:04.193 region:rollup2

YOU WILL ENSURE THAT.

03:05:38.594 --> 03:05:41.831 region:rollup2

03:06:32.782 --> 03:06:36.052 region:rollup2
INCREASES AND ADJUST THAT DOWN.

03:06:33.816 --> 03:06:36.886 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FORTY TWO PERCENT OR

03:06:36.052 --> 03:06:38.521 region:rollup2
SOME SORT OF COST SHARING RATIO

03:06:36.886 --> 03:06:40.189 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT HOW THE REMAINING COST

03:06:38.521 --> 03:06:42.491 region:rollup2
INCREASE SHARED BY CERTAIN THE

03:06:40.189 --> 03:06:43.325 region:rollup2
NON CORE PORTION OF YOU SEE THAT

03:06:42.491 --> 03:06:45.294 region:rollup2

ONE OPTION IS A SORT OF A JUST

03:06:54.170 --> 03:06:58.307 region:rollup2
DOWN THE BASE LEVEL IF YOU JUST

03:06:56.138 --> 03:06:59.275 region:rollup2
ON THAT SORT OF FIFTY TWO

03:06:58.307 --> 03:07:01.744 region:rollup2

AND THAT'S SERVING THAT A

03:07:10.686 --> 03:07:12.788 region:rollup2
SAVINGS YES THAT'S ABOUT FORTY

03:07:11.821 --> 03:07:14.323 region:rollup2

LIMITED RESULTS IN SO I GUESS

03:07:59.335 --> 03:08:00.836 region:rollup2
THAT THE QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER

03:07:59.969 --> 03:08:01.137 region:rollup2
IS.

03:08:00.836 --> 03:08:02.738 region:rollup2
IS.

03:08:01.137 --> 03:08:04.940 region:rollup2
WHAT COULD WE DO IF ANYTHING IF

03:08:02.738 --> 03:08:08.110 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO?

03:08:04.940 --> 03:08:10.179 region:rollup2

SOUGHT OUT AND TWENTY SIXTEEN TO

03:08:10.179 --> 03:08:13.616 region:rollup2
ENROLL MORE.

03:08:12.148 --> 03:08:16.152 region:rollup2
LCF AT PLUS STUDENTS IN

03:08:13.616 --> 03:08:17.653 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS IN THE UC.

03:08:16.152 --> 03:08:18.187 region:rollup2
THINK YOUR TERM MCCARTY AND

03:08:17.653 --> 03:08:19.822 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

03:08:18.187 --> 03:08:21.590 region:rollup2
.

03:08:19.822 --> 03:08:23.125 region:rollup2
WITH THE ENROLLMENT COMPONENT

03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:24.827 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A

03:08:23.125 --> 03:08:26.695 region:rollup2
TIMING ISSUE WITH HOW UC ADMITS

03:08:24.827 --> 03:08:28.197 region:rollup2
WHEN WE RECEIVED THE FUNDS AND

03:08:26.695 --> 03:08:30.032 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY WERE SENT TO CAMPUSES.

03:08:28.197 --> 03:08:32.134 region:rollup2
AND WHEN STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY

03:08:30.032 --> 03:08:34.336 region:rollup2
ADMITTED SO WE ASK THE ALL OF

03:08:32.134 --> 03:08:35.471 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUSES TO WRITE PROPOSALS

03:08:34.336 --> 03:08:37.173 region:rollup2
FOR HOW THEY WOULD SPEND THE

03:08:35.471 --> 03:08:38.541 region:rollup2
FUNDS THAT THEY RECEIVED. THEY

03:08:37.173 --> 03:08:40.042 region:rollup2
WERE GOING TO RECEIVE BETWEEN

03:08:38.541 --> 03:08:41.243 region:rollup2
TWENTY AND FORTY PERCENT OF THE

03:08:40.042 --> 03:08:42.878 region:rollup2
TWENTY MILLION WOULD BE SPREAD

03:08:41.243 --> 03:08:45.548 region:rollup2
FOR BETWEEN THE CAMPUSES FOR

03:08:42.878 --> 03:08:47.116 region:rollup2
ENROLLING NEW STUDENTS FROM LC

03:08:45.548 --> 03:08:48.984 region:rollup2
FF PLUS HIGH SCHOOLS.

03:08:47.116 --> 03:08:51.320 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T GET THOSE FUNDS

03:08:48.984 --> 03:08:52.855 region:rollup2
UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN

03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:55.024 region:rollup2
WHEN THE.

03:08:52.855 --> 03:08:56.992 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS FOR FALL HAD

03:08:55.024 --> 03:09:00.029 region:rollup2
ALREADY CLOSED.

03:08:56.992 --> 03:09:01.997 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY FOR FALL TWENTY

03:09:00.029 --> 03:09:03.933 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN YOU DIDN'T REALLY SEE

03:09:01.997 --> 03:09:04.934 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT OF THOSE FUNDS ON THE

03:09:03.933 --> 03:09:05.534 region:rollup2
RECRUITMENT OF HEALTH CFF

03:09:04.934 --> 03:09:07.570 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

03:09:05.534 --> 03:09:08.837 region:rollup2
.

03:09:07.570 --> 03:09:10.573 region:rollup2
THE RECRUITMENT OF STUDENTS

03:09:08.837 --> 03:09:11.740 region:rollup2
CONTINUED ALL THROUGH THE SPRING

03:09:10.573 --> 03:09:14.176 region:rollup2
AND THE FOLLOWING FALL AND WE

03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:16.745 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE SEEING IMPACT.

03:09:14.176 --> 03:09:18.914 region:rollup2
FOR FOOTBALL TWENTY. ODD YEAH

03:09:16.745 --> 03:09:19.348 region:rollup2
FOOTBALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN SORRY

03:09:18.914 --> 03:09:21.383 region:rollup2
IS FOR BALL TWENTY.

03:09:19.348 --> 03:09:22.751 region:rollup2
A.

03:09:21.383 --> 03:09:25.521 region:rollup2
YES BUT THIS COMING FALL WE

03:09:22.751 --> 03:09:27.022 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE SEEING IMPACT FROM UP

03:09:25.521 --> 03:09:27.623 region:rollup2
THE USE OF THESE FUNDS I GUESS

03:09:27.022 --> 03:09:30.593 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW STAFF OF STUDENTS.

03:09:27.623 --> 03:09:31.927 region:rollup2
DID IT WORK.

03:09:30.593 --> 03:09:32.828 region:rollup2
SO THERE WERE SOME YOUNG GRABS

03:09:31.927 --> 03:09:34.363 region:rollup2
YES SIR ON THERE WERE SOME

03:09:32.828 --> 03:09:36.599 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WERE HIGHLY

03:09:34.363 --> 03:09:38.734 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE SORT CAMPUSES.

03:09:36.599 --> 03:09:40.002 region:rollup2
CAME UP WITH THEIR PLANS FOR

03:09:38.734 --> 03:09:41.403 region:rollup2
SERVE THEIR STUDENTS IN

03:09:40.002 --> 03:09:43.973 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS.

03:09:41.403 --> 03:09:45.374 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES.

03:09:43.973 --> 03:09:47.343 region:rollup2
BOB LOOKED TO THINGS THAT THEY

03:09:45.374 --> 03:09:49.011 region:rollup2
THOUGHT COULD REALLY ASSIST

03:09:47.343 --> 03:09:50.713 region:rollup2
THEIR STUDENTS OFF FOR EXAMPLE

03:09:49.011 --> 03:09:52.214 region:rollup2
UC DAVIS HIRED AN ACADEMIC

03:09:50.713 --> 03:09:53.782 region:rollup2
ADVISER.

03:09:52.214 --> 03:09:55.417 region:rollup2
WHOSE JOB WAS RATHER THAN THE

03:09:53.782 --> 03:09:57.052 region:rollup2
PASSIVELY WAIT FOR STUDENTS TO

03:09:55.417 --> 03:09:58.954 region:rollup2
MAKE IT APPOINTMENT.

03:09:57.052 --> 03:10:00.789 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY MADE APPOINTMENTS WITH

03:09:58.954 --> 03:10:02.458 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FROM LCF OF HIGH

03:10:00.789 --> 03:10:04.960 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS WHO AFTER THEIR FRESHMAN

03:10:02.458 --> 03:10:06.328 region:rollup2
YEAR WERE ON ACADEMIC PROBATION.

03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:07.796 region:rollup2
AND MET WITH THOSE STUDENTS

03:10:06.328 --> 03:10:09.098 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED THEIR INDIVIDUAL

03:10:07.796 --> 03:10:10.399 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH THEM AND DIRECTED

03:10:09.098 --> 03:10:11.300 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS TO CAMPUS

03:10:10.399 --> 03:10:13.002 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT WOULD HELP THE

03:10:11.300 --> 03:10:14.670 region:rollup2
STUDENT.

03:10:13.002 --> 03:10:15.738 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT OF

03:10:14.670 --> 03:10:17.439 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION THAT THIS

03:10:15.738 --> 03:10:18.774 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC ADVISER MET WITH

03:10:17.439 --> 03:10:20.909 region:rollup2
THERE'S A TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT

03:10:18.774 --> 03:10:22.878 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN DROPOUT COMPARED TO

03:10:20.909 --> 03:10:24.446 region:rollup2
OTHER STUDENTS WHO WERE ON

03:10:22.878 --> 03:10:26.448 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC PROBATION FROM LCF OF

03:10:24.446 --> 03:10:28.083 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOLS. SO CLEARLY THERE

03:10:26.448 --> 03:10:29.251 region:rollup2
WAS SOME IMPACT THEIR THAT

03:10:28.083 --> 03:10:31.153 region:rollup2
STUDENT CONTINUATION WAS

03:10:29.251 --> 03:10:33.289 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

03:10:31.153 --> 03:10:34.890 region:rollup2
I UCLA USED SOME OF THE FOR

03:10:33.289 --> 03:10:37.092 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR LOOKED A LEARNING

03:10:34.890 --> 03:10:38.594 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH IS A

03:10:37.092 --> 03:10:40.229 region:rollup2
SERVER APPEARED TO PEER

03:10:38.594 --> 03:10:42.431 region:rollup2
MENTORING PROGRAM.%

03:10:40.229 --> 03:10:44.333 region:rollup2
DRUG PROGRAMS INCREASED FROM

03:10:42.431 --> 03:10:45.834 region:rollup2
SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS TO THREE

03:10:44.333 --> 03:10:48.504 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS

03:10:45.834 --> 03:10:49.672 region:rollup2
QUARTERLY A PARTICIPATION. AND

03:10:48.504 --> 03:10:51.840 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FOUND.

03:10:49.672 --> 03:10:53.876 region:rollup2
IS STUCK PERSISTENCE RATES AND

03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:55.544 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM WENT UP BY THREE

03:10:53.876 --> 03:10:56.845 region:rollup2
PERCENT OR THE FOR THE STUDENTS

03:10:55.544 --> 03:11:00.883 region:rollup2
AS A WHOLE WHO PARTICIPATED

VERSUS. OUR STUDENTS FROM LCF OF

03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:04.053 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM. SO

03:11:02.751 --> 03:11:06.622 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT SORT

03:11:04.053 --> 03:11:08.924 region:rollup2
OF FACE TO FACE CONTACT

03:11:06.622 --> 03:11:10.759 region:rollup2

03:29:35.797 --> 03:29:39.300 region:rollup2
ON WHETHER WE CAN FILL THE ONE

03:29:37.432 --> 03:29:40.601 region:rollup2
POINT ONE MILLION JOBS THAT WILL

03:29:39.300 --> 03:29:42.403 region:rollup2
REQUIRE A COLLEGE EDUCATION BY

03:29:40.601 --> 03:29:44.172 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND THIRTY. THAT ARE

03:29:42.403 --> 03:29:45.373 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY PROJECTED TO BE.

03:29:44.172 --> 03:29:46.441 region:rollup2

OF CALIFORNIA.

03:29:48.576 --> 03:29:51.045 region:rollup2
AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT

03:29:49.844 --> 03:29:53.014 region:rollup2
WE ARE CURRENTLY OVER ENROLLING

03:29:51.045 --> 03:29:53.915 region:rollup2

03:29:53.014 --> 03:29:55.850 region:rollup2
PRESSURE OF OVER ENROLLMENT YOU

03:29:59.120 --> 03:30:02.156 region:rollup2
WHICH REQUIRES.

03:30:01.389 --> 03:30:03.491 region:rollup2
SINCE TAKE FIFTEEN YOU

03:30:02.156 --> 03:30:05.660 region:rollup2
INSENSITIVE TWELVE UNITS

ANITA HAS GOOD INTENTIONS.

03:30:10.331 --> 03:30:13.935 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE.

03:30:12.333 --> 03:30:15.369 region:rollup2
ITS A GOOD EFFORT TO TRY AND

03:30:13.935 --> 03:30:16.938 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATE OVER IN ROME AND MAKE

03:30:15.369 --> 03:30:19.173 region:rollup2
SINCE GRADUATE FASTER.

03:30:16.938 --> 03:30:19.707 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

03:30:19.173 --> 03:30:22.276 region:rollup2
I FEAR THAT I COULD HAVE

03:30:19.707 --> 03:30:23.845 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE QUINCES.

03:30:22.276 --> 03:30:25.713 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEIR STUDENTS TO WORK

03:30:23.845 --> 03:30:27.114 region:rollup2
BUT THEMSELVES THROUGH COLLEGE.

03:30:25.713 --> 03:30:28.649 region:rollup2
THEIR STUDENTS WHO WERE TAKING

03:30:27.114 --> 03:30:31.185 region:rollup2
TWELVE UNITS BECAUSE THERE.

03:30:28.649 --> 03:30:33.354 region:rollup2
STEM MAJORS THEY'RE TAKING.

03:30:31.185 --> 03:30:34.355 region:rollup2
CLASSES LIKE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY

03:30:33.354 --> 03:30:35.356 region:rollup2
IN HIGH LEVEL CALCULUS CLASSES.

03:30:34.355 --> 03:30:36.457 region:rollup2
THAT DO NOT EQUATE TO MIND

03:30:35.356 --> 03:30:38.126 region:rollup2
NINETEEN UNITS OF POLITICS

03:30:36.457 --> 03:30:39.594 region:rollup2
CLASSES.

03:30:38.126 --> 03:30:40.461 region:rollup2
THEIR TIME INVESTMENT IS GREATER

03:30:39.594 --> 03:30:42.930 region:rollup2
AND I FEEL THAT.

03:30:40.461 --> 03:30:44.198 region:rollup2
THE.

03:30:42.930 --> 03:30:46.434 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF UNITS ARE YOU TAKE

03:30:44.198 --> 03:30:48.302 region:rollup2
IS AN ARBITRARY NUMBER. IS NOT

03:30:46.434 --> 03:30:48.903 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY PAN TO.

03:30:48.302 --> 03:30:50.138 region:rollup2
THE TIME COMMITMENT THAT WAS

03:30:48.903 --> 03:30:52.340 region:rollup2
STUDENT MAKES.

03:30:50.138 --> 03:30:54.041 region:rollup2
SO INSTEAD.

03:30:52.340 --> 03:30:55.810 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE

03:30:54.041 --> 03:30:57.578 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON A. B. THIRTY ONE

03:30:55.810 --> 03:30:59.046 region:rollup2
FIFTY THREE. WHICH WOULD EXPAND

03:30:57.578 --> 03:30:59.780 region:rollup2
SUMMER CAL GRANT.

03:30:59.046 --> 03:31:01.182 region:rollup2
FOR TWO ADDITIONAL SUMMER

03:30:59.780 --> 03:31:03.584 region:rollup2
SESSIONS.

03:31:01.182 --> 03:31:05.219 region:rollup2
AND THIS WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS.

03:31:03.584 --> 03:31:05.820 region:rollup2
PERSONAL THE SMEARS WHAT THE

03:31:05.219 --> 03:31:07.955 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY

03:31:05.820 --> 03:31:09.056 region:rollup2
DONE. BY SUPPLYING FINANCIAL AID

03:31:07.955 --> 03:31:11.058 region:rollup2
STINSON SUMMER.

03:31:09.056 --> 03:31:13.194 region:rollup2
AND.

03:31:11.058 --> 03:31:14.562 region:rollup2
IT WOULD STUDENTS.

03:31:13.194 --> 03:31:16.797 region:rollup2
STUDENTS DON'T TAKE LOWER

03:31:14.562 --> 03:31:18.132 region:rollup2
NUMBERS OF UNITS BECAUSE.

03:31:16.797 --> 03:31:19.901 region:rollup2

TO FACULTY RATIO BUT I JUST WANT

03:34:43.738 --> 03:34:46.607 region:rollup2
TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE AREN'T

03:34:44.805 --> 03:34:47.508 region:rollup2
JUST STUDENT ANECDOTES. THESE

03:34:46.607 --> 03:34:49.276 region:rollup2
ARE CONCRETE ISSUES THAT HAVE

03:34:47.508 --> 03:34:51.412 region:rollup2
REALLY REAL IMPACTS ON THE

03:34:49.276 --> 03:34:53.047 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF EDUCATION I HAVE MY

03:34:51.412 --> 03:34:54.148 region:rollup2
CLASSES IN COSTUMES WITH BROKEN

03:34:53.047 --> 03:34:55.349 region:rollup2

ROLLING MY FALL SEMESTER COURSES

03:34:56.917 --> 03:35:00.287 region:rollup2
THE MANY OF THE CLASSES I NEED

03:34:58.319 --> 03:35:01.355 region:rollup2
FOR MY MAJOR AND FOR GRADUATION

03:35:00.287 --> 03:35:03.124 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY FILLED UP.

03:35:01.355 --> 03:35:04.492 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE ENROLLMENT HAVE IS

03:35:03.124 --> 03:35:05.960 region:rollup2
RESULTED IN MASSIVE OVERCROWDING

03:35:04.492 --> 03:35:07.795 region:rollup2
THE DATA SCIENCE COURSE THAT I'M

03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:08.696 region:rollup2
IN RIGHT NOW IS OVER ROLLED SO

03:35:07.795 --> 03:35:10.030 region:rollup2
MUCH THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO

03:35:08.696 --> 03:35:11.332 region:rollup2
TURN STUDENTS AWAY FROM LECTURE

03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:12.366 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE LECTURE HALL CAN'T

03:35:11.332 --> 03:35:14.001 region:rollup2
FIT THE THOUSANDS OF ENROLLED

03:35:12.366 --> 03:35:15.603 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN THAT CLASS.

03:35:14.001 --> 03:35:16.537 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEAR THAT THE UC SYSTEM

03:35:15.603 --> 03:35:18.572 region:rollup2
DESPERATELY NEEDS THIS FUNDING

03:35:16.537 --> 03:35:19.540 region:rollup2
IS THE INVESTMENT IS INADEQUATE

03:35:18.572 --> 03:35:21.075 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FALLS ON

03:35:19.540 --> 03:35:21.909 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS

03:35:21.075 --> 03:35:23.210 region:rollup2
I JUST WISH THAT THE STATE OF

03:35:21.909 --> 03:35:24.311 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WOULD PRIORITIZE

03:35:23.210 --> 03:35:26.347 region:rollup2
IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY

03:35:24.311 --> 03:35:27.581 region:rollup2

03:35:39.994 --> 03:35:43.130 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT WERE MENTIONED ABOUT

03:35:41.162 --> 03:35:45.166 region:rollup2
OVERCROWDING. NOW I APPRECIATE

03:35:43.130 --> 03:35:46.500 region:rollup2

THE UC SYSTEM AND HOW IT

03:35:48.202 --> 03:35:51.906 region:rollup2
REFLECTS THE OVERCROWDING THAT'S

03:35:49.937 --> 03:35:53.507 region:rollup2
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW BUT. I WANT

03:35:51.906 --> 03:35:54.442 region:rollup2
TO EMPHASIZE THAT.

03:35:53.507 --> 03:35:56.410 region:rollup2

CAMPUS.

03:36:01.348 --> 03:36:05.786 region:rollup2
AND IT IS LITERALLY FILLED TO

03:36:03.918 --> 03:36:07.922 region:rollup2
THE BRIM WITH STUDENTS SITTING

03:36:05.786 --> 03:36:10.024 region:rollup2
ON THE GROUND BECAUSE THERE'S NO

03:36:07.922 --> 03:36:11.826 region:rollup2
OTHER PLACE TO STUDY. IMAGINE

03:36:10.024 --> 03:36:13.360 region:rollup2
WALKING INTO YOUR OFFICE AND

03:36:11.826 --> 03:36:15.296 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEING TWENTY PEOPLE

03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:15.863 region:rollup2
SITTING ALL OVER THE GROUND AND

03:36:15.296 --> 03:36:16.497 region:rollup2
YOU NOT BE ABLE TO GET YOUR

03:36:15.863 --> 03:36:18.032 region:rollup2
DESK.

03:36:16.497 --> 03:36:20.201 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

03:36:18.032 --> 03:36:21.735 region:rollup2
I ALSO SEE IN MY OWN RESIDENTIAL

03:36:20.201 --> 03:36:25.005 region:rollup2

03:36:30.277 --> 03:36:33.614 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH LARGER

03:36:32.213 --> 03:36:36.016 region:rollup2
ROOMS FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO

03:36:33.614 --> 03:36:38.486 region:rollup2

IN THE COMMON ROOM OF OUR FLOOR

IN THEIR OWN ROOM OR NOT ENOUGH

03:36:47.561 --> 03:36:51.198 region:rollup2

OFFER STUDY SPACE AND AN AREA

03:37:00.374 --> 03:37:03.744 region:rollup2

THERE'S UNBELIEVABLE

03:39:18.545 --> 03:39:22.082 region:rollup2
OVERCROWDING A LACK OF BASIC
