ONE REFERENCE CHAIR WHICH IS THE NEW STANDARD FOR CATASTROPHIC FIRES. YEAH CLIMBED SIXTEEN SECTION FOUR REFERS TO FORTUNE FOR FIFTEEN WHY BUT THE S. B. NINE ONE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE REPORT CREATES A NEW STANDARD FOR CATASTROPHIC FIRES GOING FORWARD. SO THIS WOULD APPLY TO GENERAL COST RECOVERY IT WOULD NOT APPLY TO CUT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES.
