HOLD OPEN ITEMS TODAY WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE SESSION AS TO ALL ITEMS. WE'RE GOING TO ADJUST THE THE BATTING ORDER A LITTLE BIT IN THE SENSE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE -- ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES FIRST AND THEN MOVE THROUGH THE AGENDA STARTING WITH ISSUE NUMBER -- ONE IN ORDER FROM THAT POINT ON SO WE'RE ON ITEM SIXTY ONE HUNDRED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES. PAGE IXTEEN ON THE AGENDA OKAY IF YOU WOULD -- IDENTIFY YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE READY MA'AM. I RECOUNT MINOR WITH THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION THANK YOU ROOMS THE THANKS FOR JOINING US. KEITH IS ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU SERVICE EMILY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS LEE THANK YOU [inaudible] OVER FROM. FOR THANK YOU. OKAY WHO WANTS TO START. A GOOD START -- SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SEVEN HIGH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. TO PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH -- FACILITIES BARRIERS THERE PREVENTING THEM FROM -- OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. TO ADDRESS THOSE IT BARRIERS THAT ARE THAT ARE PREVENTING THAT SO I'M THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT -- ONE NOTABLE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE ARE ALLOWING THE SAVINGS -- FROM ANY PROJECTS ACROSS THERE ARE FUNDS THAT AREN'T USED TO BE USED FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS TO BUILD CAPACITY. FOR THOSE NEW A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. OKAY [inaudible] HELLO. CHAIR ANYWAY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A HANDOUT THAT I'LL BE REFERENCING THROUGHOUT MY PRESENTATION THIS MORNING. STARTING ON PAGE ONE WE OFFER SOME BACKGROUND ON FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN ENDS THE CAN GARDEN FACILITY GRANTS. AS BACKGROUND IN KINDERGARTEN THE STATE REQUIRES DISTRICTS OFFER KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS BUT LEAVES IT TO DISTRICTS TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF THESE PROGRAMS. PARTY PROGRAMS OPERATE BETWEEN THREE TO FOUR HOURS WHEREAS FULL DAY PROGRAMS OPERATE MORE THAN FOUR HOURS. I'M AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO CREATE KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANTS. THESE GRANTS WERE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE MORE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE BY COVERING FACILITY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. DEEP KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS TO FULL DAY PROGRAMS FOR INSTANCE A DISTRICT ME RUN A MORNING SESSION AND AN AFTERNOON SESSION AND ONE CHAIR CLASSROOM. BUT ONCE THAT WAS PART DAY PROGRAMS ARE CONVERTED TO TWO FULL DAY CLASSROOMS -- FULL DAY PROGRAMS EACH PROGRAM WOULD REQUIRE SEPARATE CLASSROOM IN THESE GRANTS WOULD HELP COVER SOME OF THOSE AS THOUGH IT SUCCEEDED FACILITY COSTS. IN THE FIRST APPLICATION AROUND WHICH CONCLUDED JANUARY OF THIS YEAR A TOTAL OF SEVENTY DISTRICTS OMITTED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO PROJECTS REQUESTING. THE TWO MILLION AND FINDING THIS EXCEEDS THE TOTAL ONE HUNDRED MILLION PROVIDED FOR THE PROGRAM. A SECOND APPLICATION AROUND WILL OCCUR NEXT MONTH IN MAY TO ALLOCATE THE REMAINING FUNDING. WILL SKIP PAGE TWO BECAUSE THAT JUST COVERS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY COVERED. I'M MOVING ON TO PAGE THREE AND OUR ASSESSMENTS WE OUTLINED THREE MAIN CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FIRST WE ARE CONCERNS THAT THE ADDITIONAL GRANTS ARE NOT LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THE SEATS GOAL OF HAVING MORE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE FIGURE ON PAGE THREE WE ANALYZE THE INITIAL ROUND OF APPLICANTS AND FOUND THAT 76% OF THE SEVENTY APPLICANTS ALREADY RUN FULL DAY PROGRAMS. THESE ARE DISTRICTS APPLYING TO LARGELY REPLACE EXISTING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS THAT DO NOT MEET CITY REGULATIONS. AND THIS WAS A SECONDARY PURPOSE FOR THE GRANTS. THE LEGISLATURE WORD EXPAND THE PROGRAM AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES WE THINK A SIMILARLY HIGH SHERIFF GRANTS WOULD GO TO DISTRICTS ALREADY RUNNING FULL DAY PROGRAMS. SECOND WE FOUND THAT DISTRICTS ME OPERATE PARTY PART PROGRAMS FOR REASONS BEYOND FACILITY CONSTRAINTS FOR EXAMPLE SOME DISTRICTS TOLD US THAT THEIR PARENTS PREFERRED THEIR CHILDREN ATTEND A PARTY PROGRAM. ARE THESE PARENTS THINK THAT FIVE YEAR OLDS ARE NOT ARE NOT SEE READY FOR A LONGER DAY OF INSTRUCTION. OTHER DISTRICTS INDICATED THAT THEIR TEACHERS PREFER PART DAY PROGRAMS BECAUSE THE LEAD CLASS FOR A FEW HOURS AND THEN PROVIDE. AND ASSISTANCE FOR ANOTHER TEACHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY DISTRICTS MAY ALSO USE THESE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS TO PROVIDE OTHER INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES I'M SUCH AS INTENSIVE READING INTERVENTION OR TEACHING MATH OR SCIENCE TO OLDER CHILDREN -- IN AFTER HIM. GIVEN THESE ISSUES WE THINK SOME PORTION OF DISTRICTS RUNNING PARTY PROGRAMS MAY SIMPLY NOT BE INTERESTED IN THESE GRANTS. THIRD MOST DISTRICTS INTERESTED IN OPERATING FULL THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COVER THEIR FACILITY COSTS WITH EXISTING SOURCES OF STATE AND LOCAL FINDING. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THE SHARE OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN FULLY PROGRAMS GREW FROM 43% A DISTRICT INTERESTED IN RUNNING FULL DAY PROGRAMS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING THROUGH THE EXISTING SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM WHICH IS THE STATE WATER LONGER STANDING PROGRAM THAT HELPS FUND SCHOOL FACILITIES FOR ALL GRADES. OR DISTRICTS MAY RELY ON LOCAL FIND FOR AYE DRESSING THESE FACILITY CONSTRAINTS. MOVING ON TO THE LAST PAGE. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE REFRAIN FROM EXPANDING THE PROGRAM AT THIS TIME WE DO OFFER TO MORE TARGETED OPTION SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE REMAIN INTERESTED IN PROMOTING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. FIRST THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL NEXT YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AFTER KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE DEMAND AFTER THE INITIAL ONE HUNDRED MILLION IS AWARDED. IF THE LEGISLATURE DESIRES TO PROVIDE MORE FACILITY GRANTS BASED ON ANY REMAINING FUNDING WE RECOMMEND IT FOCUS THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY ON DISTRICTS RUNNING PART DAY PROGRAM DUE TO FACILITY CONSTRAINTS. SECONDLY THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER CREATING AN EVEN STRONGER INCENTIVEFOR FULL DAY PROGRAMS BY REDUCING THE PART DAY PER STUDENT RAY UNDER LCF OVER THREE YEARS. CURRENTLY PER DAY AND FULL DTE PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED AT THE SAME PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVELS DESPITE THE DIFFERENCE AN INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER WE THE RATE TO REFLECT THE LOWER OUR THE LOWER HOURS OF INSTRUCTION. EVER BEFORE LOWERING THAT OUT ALONG THE PART THE RATE WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WEIGH THE TRADE OFFS CAREFULLY SINCE SOME PARENTS MAY PREFER TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THE PARK DAY PROGRAMS. WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU OKAY -- MA'AM. I RECOMMEND IT WITH THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND I'D JUST LIKE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE APPLICANTS FOR THIS FIRST ROUND A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN FUNDING -- AS WAS STATED WE DID HAVE SEVENTY TWO DISTRICT THAT SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION FOR THE FIRST THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION OF THE FIRST OTHER MILLION THAT WAS MADE A FULL. SIXTEEN OF THOSE DISTRICTS OR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. THE STATUTE IS WRITTEN TO PROVIDE PRIORITY TO THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A HIGH PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. AND ALSO FOR THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL HARDSHIP ASSISTANCE WHICH ARE THE DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE. THE ABILITY TO MAKE THEIR FULL MATCH ON LOCAL FACILITIES PROJECTS. WITH THE FIRST ROUND OF THE THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION THERE WE IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND TWELVE PROJECTS. AND ALL TWELVE OF THOSE DISTRICTS -- QUALIFIED FOR FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. NINE OF THE TWELVE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. I AM IN THE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS PERCENTAGES FOR THE DISTRICTS THAT WILL RECEIVE FUNDING WERE BETWEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND 96%. AND AS WE LOOK AT THE APPLICATIONS WHAT WE DID LEARN IS THAT THOSE DISTRICTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN HAD APPLIED TO THE PROGRAM. WHERE THEY WERE HOUSING THE STUDENTS WAS LARGELY IN PORTABLES? STANDARD CLASSROOMS WITHOUT RESTROOMS AND OF SMALLER SIZE THAN TO TYPICAL KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS. AND IN SOME CASES -- IN WHAT USED TO BE A COMPUTER LAB AND A TEACHER -- WORK AREA. AND THE OTHER THING WE NOTED WAS THAT FOR THOSE THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN THAT WILL NOT RECEIVE FUNDING. THAT IS LARGELY DUE TO THEM NOT AB QUALIFYING FOR THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP OR HAVING A LOW PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WITH FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS OR IN SOME CASES. A BOWL FACTORS APPLIED. AND WITH THAT WERE HAVING ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION [inaudible] DR. THANKS FOR THE INVITATION THE DISCUSSION -- A GROUP OF PRACTITIONERS AND POLICY THINKERS NEARLY CHILDHOOD FIELD IN OVER THE LAST. EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE'VE BEEN EXAMINING A VARIETY OF POLICY PROPOSALS AND THE CHILD CARE AND PRE K. -- SECTOR -- I THINK MISS WINS PASSED AROUND COPIES OF A BRIEF THAT WE'VE JUST PUT OUT RECENTLY WHICH TRIES TO LOOK. AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF PULLED A KINDERGARTEN PRESENTLY. AROUND THE STATE KIND OF LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE. AND SECONDLY LOOKS AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN TKA PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE -- YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU A VARIETY OF PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SPACE -- WE THOUGHT THROUGH AT LEAST TWO OR THREE CRITERIA THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL IN WEIGHING THE RELATIVE MERITS OF THESE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS -- ONE IS THE UTILITY OF LENGTHENING INSTRUCTIONAL TIME QUOTE UNQUOTE FOR CHILDREN ALREADY ENROLLED IN PART DAY KINDERGARTEN. OR PRE K. -- A SECOND. THAT IS WHAT IS THE VALUE OF MOVING FROM PART DATA FULL DAY. WITHIN PRE K. AND OR KINDERGARTEN. SECONDLY WHAT'S THE RELATIVE WHAT ARE THE RELATIVE LEVELS OF UNMET IMMEDIATE NEED ACROSS AGE GROUPS. OTHER FULL DAY K. PROGRAM LOOKS PRIMARILY A FIVE YEAR OLDS WE KNOW THAT ENROLLMENT RATES FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS -- ARE MUCH LOWER AT THE PRE K. LEVEL. ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN REGIONS REGIONS OF THE STATE LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE INLAND EMPIRE -- AND FINALLY A THIRD CRITERION MIGHT BE -- WHO WANT EMPHASIZE -- AS WE EXPAND EARLY CHILD CARE AND EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION -- AND THIS IS SORT OF A LEADING QUESTION FROM OUR BRIEF IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT WHO WHO CURRENTLY BENEFITS FROM FULL THEY QUE. BENEFITS FROM FULL DAY I TKA AND HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO A MUCH LOWER LEVELS OF ENROLLMENT. FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. SO. LET ME JUST BRIEFLY -- EMPHASIZE A FEW FINDINGS FROM FROM OUR WORK AND AND THEIR WATER CHARTS AND FIGURES IN THIS BRIEF HOPEFULLY THERE HOPEFULLY THEY'RE DIGESTIBLE -- FIRST OF ALL NEARLY THREE FOURTHS OF ALL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS PRESENTLY OFFER FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN -- WE SEE THIS AND FIGURE ONE OF PAID ON PAGE THREE OF THE BRIEF -- THE SHARE OF SCHOOLS OFFERING FULL THEY QUE IT'S BEEN RISING IN RECENT YEARS. WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL FACILITIES DOLLARS AS BEFORE THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. INVESTMENT THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR -- THESE RATES OF FOLD A. K. A. -- HAVE BEEN RISING -- THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED THROUGH. LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING. NEXT IF WE ISOLATE ON THE ONE QUARTER OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THAT SERVE THE HIGHEST SHARES OF POOR CHILDREN. OVER 80% FOURTH. THE SCHOOLS ALREADY OFFER FULL THEY QUE THIS IS SHOWN. IN THE LWER PANEL OF FIGURE -- TO AND AGAIN WE SEE GROWTH EVEN IN IN THE MOST -- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- PROBABLY THANKS TO SOME TITLE ONE FUNDING FROM THE FEDS AS WELL AS LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING -- IN THE MOST ADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES OF THE STATE IF THAT IS THE QUARTER OF SCHOOLS THAT SERVE THE MOST WELL OFF. FAMILIES FULLY QUE IS BEEN GROWING AS WELL OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AGAIN WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL. IN FULL DAY K. -- WITH OR WITHOUT TARGETED INCENTIVES AND I THINK THIS IS A THIS IS A POINT THE LA I WAS ALREADY. MADE. ON PAGE FIVE OF THE OF THE BRIEF -- THERE'S A MAP FOR SOMETHING CALIFORNIA -- THAT SHOWS THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION IT'S SORT OF JUST -- VIVIDLY ILLUSTRATES HOW FULL THEY QUE TENDS TO BE LOCATED IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES ON THE REMAINING. PART DAY PROGRAMS ARE IN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS AND AFFLUENT. COMMUNITIES -- AS THE OFFICE PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION JUST INDICATE IT'S THE TARGETING LANGUAGES WORKING. TO SOME EXTENT IN TERMS OF FOCUSING NEW DOLLARS ON FOR COMMUNITIES. ALTHOUGH THE BULK OF THOSE COMMUNITIES ALREADY OFFER FULL DAY. K.. I'M WHEN WE LOOK AT TKD IS HEADED IS ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL THAT IS WE SEE UPWARD GROWTH -- OVERALL IN FULL TKA -- ACCEPTED THEM ONE THIRD OF ELEMENTARY'S IN THE STATE'S POOREST COMMUNITIES -- DO NOT OFFER T. K. THAT IS WE HAVE A REMAINING ONE THIRD. A LITTLE OVER 33% OF ELEMENTARY IS THAT STILL. DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR WHERE WITH ALL TO OFFER FULL DAY TKA -- BUT WE HAVE MUCH MORE ROOM TO GROW OUT TKA FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS AND WE DO. TO GROW OUT FULL DAY FOR FIVE YEAR OLDS AND AGAIN. WE KNOW THAT A ONLY ABOUT HALF OF ALL THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS CAN FIND ANY SORT OF PRE K.. PROGRAMS SO I THINK IT'S BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF RELATIVE NEED. AND RELATIVE UNMET NEEDS. SO THERE'S A COUPLE TAKE AWAYS HERE ONE IS ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES TO EXPAND FULL DAY K.. WOULD MOST LIKELY BENEFIT FAMILIES AND BETTER OFF PARTS OF THE STATE OR IN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ALREADY OFFER FULL DAY K. AS YOU JUST HEARD -- NEW FUNNY COULD FINANCE RENOVATION OF ALL CLASSROOMS. IN DISTRICTS ALREADY RUNNING FULL DAY K. THAT IS WE HAVE WE DO HAVE OBVIOUSLY BIG NEED IN CENTRAL VALLEY. INLAND EMPIRE PART DATE WERE FACILITIES ARE OLD. AND WE NEED TO RENOVATE THOSE FACILITIES SO NEW FUNDING COULD HELP IN THAT WAY BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP US EXPAND -- FULL DAY K. IT JUST ALLOWS EXISTING DISTRICTS WITH FULL DAY QUE. TO IMPROVE THEIR FACILITIES. AND SECONDLY THERE'S MUCH MORE ROOM TO GROW TKA FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS AND TO GROW FULL DAY K. FOR FIVE YEAR OLDS. AND I JUST CLOSE WITH THE THIRD POINT WHICH IS OTHER RESEARCHERS OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY HAVE. PRETTY MUCH DETERMINE THE FULL DAY K. DOES RAISE KIDS EARLY COGNITIVE GROWTH IN EARLY LITERACY SKILLS WILL THEY QUE IS EFFECTIVE. BUT THERE'S A BIG PROVISO HERE WHICH IS THAT THOSE EFFECTS ON KIDS ARE MUCH STRONGER. FOR YOUNGSTERS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS AS OPPOSED TO UPPER MIDDLE CLASS. GRAMS. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WHAT DOCTOR WHAT WITH RESPECT TO WELL. I GUESS LET ME AS THIS WHAT WOULD BE YOUR SUGGESTION. OR OF WHAT WOULD BE YOUR SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF TRYING. TO EXPAND FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN TO THOSE REGIONS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T CURRENTLY OFFER IT TO THE PLEDGE ANALYSTS TO SUGGESTED. AB SUGGESTING THE THE RATES THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN THE US -- BETWEEN PART DAY IN FULL DAY. AS ONE ALTERNATIVE YEAH I THINK THAT HAS MERIT SENATOR -- NOW AS YOU KNOW -- DISTRICTS GET THE SAME REIMBURSEMENT SO TO SPEAK WHETHER THEY HAVE PARKED THEIR FULL DAY AND IN SOME DISTRICTS TEACHERS ARE OPTING TO STAY WITH PART DAY BECAUSE AND THERE'S NO FINANCIAL PENALTY SO I THINK DIFFERENTIAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES RADIATE RATES -- FOR FULL DAY PROGRAMS IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA -- IF THERE'S A WAY TO TIGHTEN THE BUDGET CONTROL LANGUAGE. TO BETTER ENSURE THAT THE MONEY'S MOVING TO THOSE DISTRICTS THAT DON'T OFFER FULL THE DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS THAT DON'T OFFER FULL DAY AT THE CONTROL LANGUAGE MIGHT HELP. THE OTHER IDEA THAT I KNOW IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE IS TO TRY. TO TARGET THIS MONEY ON TKA WITHIN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH WOULD GO TOWARDS INCREASING. ENROLLMENT RATES FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS. WHICH WE NOR MUCH LOWER THAN CURRENT SERVICES FOR FIVE ROOMS SO SORT OF DIVERT THE PROPOSED FUNDING AWAY FROM. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN TO THE T. CASE -- YEAH IT WOULD STILL PARTIALLY ACCOMPLISHED THE GOVERNOR'S OBJECTIVE OF OF EATING KINDERGARTEN BUT IT WOULD RAISE SERVICES AND AND ACCESS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS AS OPPOSED. TO FIVE FINANCE WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON THE LA -- HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS SOME ALTERNATIVES AND IN TERMS OF SUGGESTING A MOVE AWAY FROM PART TIME AND TOWARD FULL TIME FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. YEAH I MEAN WE AT THIS POINT WE KNOW WE STILL NEED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS AS AS A SUBMITTED BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE ARE TAKING THOSE -- THAT FEEDBACK ELLIE -- PROVIDED AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BROUGHT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE DEVELOP A REVISION -- THERE INTO THE IDEAS OR THOUGHTS IN IN THOSE. IN THOSE REPORTS HAVE MERIT BUT WE NEED TO DO AN ANALYSIS AND YOU KNOW TAKE THAT TAKE THAT TAKE THEM INTO CONSIDERATION WITH ALL OTHER FACTORS A ME TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. I DO APPRECIATE YOUR POSITION. SIR LIVE ANY QUESTIONS YES. SO. BECAUSE SHE QUE HAS NO -- JEWEL BILL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS -- LOW INCOME KIDS ARE NOT PRIORITIZE SAT CORRECT. SO THAT IN THAT THERE ARE IN THERE WOULD BE NO REQUIREMENT THAT THIS WAS DONE AT THAT AT TITLE ONE SCHOOLS WHICH ARE POOREST SCHOOLS. SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS WOULD THAT BE THE BEST EXPENDITURE OF OUR MONEY EXPANDING THE T. K. PROGRAM. I AM I GUESS MY MY CONCERN IS IS WE WOULD ONLY BE BUT WE ONLY BE HELPING. KIDS THAT COME FROM FAMILIES WHERE THEY DON'T NEED THE HELP. WELL IF THEY GET. FROM FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IT DEPENDS ON HOW PRECISELY CONTROL LANGUAGE WOULD BE -- I THINK THE THE THE OPTION WE'RE RAISING IS TO BETTER FOCUS THIS ON FOUR YEAR OLDS. AND THEN -- TO THE EXTENT THAT DISTRICTS IN LOW INCOME% COMMUNITIES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BID FOR THESE DOLLARS TRY TO FOCUS THE DOLLARS BETTER ON THOSE. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT OFFER. OUR DAY. ANYTHING SOMETIMES THAT'S A PROBLEM RIGHT WITH OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE CAPACITY AND WOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BID. SO. MAYBE WE NEED TO MAKE A REQUIREMENT THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER OUR MOST NEEDY CHILDREN. THERE'S ALSO BEEN A HELPFUL CONVERSATION I THINK IN CD E.. AROUND TRYING TO WORK WITH AN INTERMEDIARY NONPROFIT WHO CAN HELP BILL CAPACITY. IN DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE AS YOU'RE POINTING OUT SENATOR IT'S A VERY. DISTRICTS THAT NEED THIS FUNDAMENTAL THESE CAPACITY YEAH THE BILL. YES OKAY WAS JUST SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT YEAH THANK YOU WELL MAYBE YOU COULD CLARIFY FOR ME WHAT BY CAPACITY WHAT WHAT ARE THE LIMITING FACTORS IN. SOME OF OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING. T. K. PROGRAM. WELL THIS IS MY FIRST RODEO IN THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO I HOW JUDGE. SO I THOUGHT IF I FIVE AS GOOD. QUESTION IS A VERY INTELLIGENT BEAR WITH ME. I THINK PROBABLY OTHERS YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY THAT ARE BETTER INFORMED ON THIS I DO THINK THE TEACHER SHORTAGE IS A PROBLEM -- TRYING TO FIND TEACHERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH YOUNG KIDS. IS A BIG PROBLEM. ESPECIALLY IN MORE RURAL AND HIGH NEED AREAS WERE SALARIES MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT LOWER -- FACILITIES I THINK IS A STELLAR CONSTRAINT TO SOME EXTENT ESPECIALLY AN AGING AREAS LIKE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE CENTRAL VALLEY. FAR NORTH -- BUT I IDEA I THINK THE OTHER PROBLEM HERE OUT THERE FROM SMALLER DISTRICTS. IS THAT THEY HAVE TO CONTRACT OUT WITH A CONSULTANT OR THEY HAVE TO FIND AN ARCHITECT OR THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH FIRMS TO TO PUT THESE BIDS INTO THE OFFICE PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND IT'S NOT LIKE OUT LA UNIFIED THAT HAS AN ARMY OF PEOPLE. TO TO MAKE THOSE BIDS SO I THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF ORGANIZING CAPACITY THAT. THE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AND THAT LAST PIECES OF FACTOR -- ACROSS THE BOARD NOT JUST ANTI CAVE. IN OUR ENTIRE. PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROCESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- I HEAR THAT TOO SO THAT. THOSE POINTS THAT YOU MAKE SHOULD INFORM OUR CONSIDERATION OF OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET WHERE WE'RE THE GOVERNOR AND MINISTRATION PROPERLY IS ATTEMPTING. TO INCENTIVIZE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF TEACHERS AND PROVIDE THE MONEY FOR IMPROVEMENT OF FACILITIES. AT ALL DRIVES TOWARD. THE T. K. OBJECTIVE IF IN FACT THAT'S OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO TAME. ANY OTHER COMMENTS PANELISTS. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT PRESENTATION I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER TALKING ABOUT THIS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE BUDGET IN THE REVISIONS TO THE BUDGET THANK YOU DOCTOR PARTICULAR FOR COMING VISITS. OKAY LET'S RETURN TO THE BATTING ORDER ON THE AGENDA ISSUE NUMBER ONE CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION. BACKGROUND AND CASELOAD CHANGE I USUALLY I'M USED TO HAVING LA -- AND FINANCE ON WINGS. GOOD MORNING IT IS STILL MORNING THANK GOODNESS. IF I COULD ASK YOU TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT. GOOD MORNING SIR NOVEL MORGAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE WAR IN THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GOOD MORNING WITH SOME RESIDENTS YOU AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MA'AM GOOD MORNING SIR BERNARD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND FAIR CORTEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RITUS THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. I GUESS FINANCE. YEAH I'M STARTING RIGHT -- TODAY AND THIS ISSUE IS A GOOD MORNING -- ALSO BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT -- THAT'S HAT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO YOU AND I'LL COVER A FEW PAGES ON THE HAND OUT FOR ISSUE. ONE AND THEN I'LL COVER THE REMAINING PAGES FOR ISSUE TWO AND ISSUE THREE CELL. AND KEEP LOS I'M SO FOR ISSUE ONE TODAY I WAS ASKED TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW WITH SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON CHILD CARE INCREASED PROGRAMS. SO STARTING ON PAGE ONE WE HAVE A TABLE THAT SHOWS FUNDED CHILDCARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS IN THEIR KEY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS VERY THE PROGRAM COULD HAVE AN INCOME ELIGIBILITY AGE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT OR SO SHE DID WORK REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON THE PROGRAM. THE TOP PROGRAM LISTED CAL WORKS HEALTHCARE IN THE BOTTOMLESS PROGRAM LISTED TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN ARE INTENDED TO SERVE ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN -- TO SERVE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN IN THESE PROGRAMS A STATE WE NEED TO CHANGE THE ELIGIBILITY RULES OF THESE PROGRAMS. THE MIDDLE TO PROGRAMS LISTED ARE -- WHICH IS THE ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM GENERAL CHILD CARE PROGRAM AND STATE PRESCHOOL THESE ARE REFERRED TO AS THE CAP PROGRAMS THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN SERVED IN THESE PROGRAMS ARE DETERMINED IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET APPROPRIATION. TO SERVE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN IN THESE PROGRAMS THE STATE WOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET. MOVING ON TO PAGE TWO SHOWS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN SERVED IN THE STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS. WE ESTIMATE FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE SERVED IN THESE PROGRAMS WITH A LITTLE MORE OF HALF OF THE SLOTS SPECIFICALLY AVAILABLE FOR PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. WE WILL NOTE THAT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ELIGIBLE ELIGIBLE IT FOR THE STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS IS FAR GREATER THAN THE NUMBER SERVED. MOVING ALONG TO PAGE THREE THE STATE PROVIDES FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION TO CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS ON THIS COME FROM THE MIX OF STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS WITH THE BULK OF FUNDS USED FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE STATE FUNDS. ON PAGE OF FOUR OF THE FIGURE ON THIS FIGURE SHOWS THAT THE STATE FUNDS PROGRAMS IN A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS. I'M IN OUR FIRST BUCKET HERE WE HAVE VOUCHER PROGRAMS IS POWER CHILD CARE IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM AND THIS IS WHERE THE STATE PROVIDES A FAMILY WITH THE VOUCHER. AND THE FAMILY CHOOSES A CHILD CARE PROVIDER THAT BEST MEETS THEIR NEEDS SO FAMILY CONSISTS FAMILIES CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN RECEIVED CARE THROUGH A CENTER BASED SETTING. A FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME OR THROUGH A FAMILY OR FRIEND ABOUT YOUR THROUGH THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE WHICH I'LL DESCRIBE MORE ON THE NEXT. MOVING DOWN THE PAGE THE SECOND THE SECOND BOX HERE -- IT WE HAVE DIRECT CONTRACT PROGRAMS HERE LOCAL PROVIDERS TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO TERMINUS TO DETERMINE A SET NUMBER OF CHILDREN TO SERVE. THESE PROVIDERS ALSO HAVE TO ME AN ADDITIONAL SET OF DEVELOPMENTAL STANDARDS AND DIRECT CONTRACTOR FIGHTERS ARE REIMBURSED USING THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE WHICH IS SET ANNUALLY IN THE IN THE BUDGET ACT. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE WE HAVE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA HERE DISTRICTS A REPORT ATTENDANCE IN THE STATE ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- FOR THOSE ENROLLED CHILDREN. AND MOVING ALONG TO PAGE FIVE SHOWS ANNUAL FULL TIME RATES -- AND HE'S GREAT VERY BY PROGRAM TYPE SETTING THE CHILD -- THE STE THE SETTING THE CHILD SERVED IN AND THE AGE OF THE CHILD SERVED. SO THE TWO BARS ON THE LEFT CHAU THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE HERE RATES VERY BY THE REGION IN ADDITION TO THE AGE IN THE SETTING. SUN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE IS BASED ON A TWENTY SIXTEEN SURVEY. THE SURVEY IS CONDUCTED EVERY TWO YEARS -- AND THE DAY OF FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY WAS RECENTLY MADE AVAILABLE. THE NEXT TO BAR SHOW THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND THIS IS SAID ANNUALLY BY THE STATE AND THE LOS SHOWS THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO HAVE A COMPARISON OF ALL OF THESE. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS FOR THE OVERVIEW TRANSACTION BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. NEXT HOW ARE YOU. SO I'LL COVER SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CHILD CARE AND I WOULD ADD THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS INCLUDES MULTIPLE INVESTMENTS. TO IN PROGRAMS FOR ZERO TO FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE STATE AND IT REALLY FOCUSES ON A TWO GENERATION WHOLE CHILD APPROACH THAT AIMS TO STRENGTHEN THE VARIOUS DEVELOPMENTAL -- EDUCATIONAL FINANCIAL AND HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES -- PAGE SIX OF THE HEARING AGENDA DOES A GOOD JOB OF OUTLINING SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT THE GOVERNORS. GOVERNORS BUDGET HAS IN THESE AREAS. SO I WILL BRIEFLY COVER THAT THERE ARE SOME TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE TO COVER SOME FOR YOUR COST OF CERTAIN SLOTS. AS WELL OF IT AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL COLA AND GROWTH -- ADJUSTMENTS -- WE'VE NOTABLY INCLUDED A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS AN ON GOING ON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT I'M GENERAL FUND. TO STAGE TWO AND STAGE -- THREE CAL WORKS CHILDCARE PROGRAMS -- WE BELIEVE THE COSTS ARE INCREASING BECAUSE THE CASELOAD IN BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS CONTINUES TO INCREASE AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT FEES INCREASE IS DRIVING CASE. POLICY CHANGES THAT WERE MADE IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT THAT CHANGE SOME OF THE ELIGIBILITY FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BARRISTER NOVEL MORGAN BUT THE EARLY LEARNING CARE DIVISION AND ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND UP THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AT WE WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. INTO THINK MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO YOU AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF EARLY LEARNING. GRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. THANKS TO THE LEGISLATORS AFTER IT'S OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AS WELL AS THE FORMER GOVERNOR. INVESTMENTS IN THE EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM ARE NO LONGER BELOW THE PRE RECESSION LEVELS THIS IS DUE IN LARGE PART TO RATE INCREASES ACROSS THE BOARD. INTO THE EXPANSION OF STATE. THE SUPERINTENDENT IS EXCITED TO SEE THAT KNOWLEDGE MEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY LEARNING CARE. AND THE FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE CHILD AND FAMILY MORE BROADLY. EXPANDED ACCESS TO QUALITY EARLY LEARNING CARE WITH A FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE WHOLE CHILD AND FAMILY. WILL BE ABSOLUTELY KEY DOES. THERE TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND STOP THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AS WE DROP INTO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE REALLY HAVE COME A LONG WAY OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS IT WOULD BE OUR CAO WORKS CHILD CARE PROGRAM. AS THE LA -- MENTIONED ARE CAO WORKS PROGRAM IS DIVIDED INTO THREE STAGES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND MINISTERS THE SECOND TWO STAGES OF THE PROGRAM. WHILE THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ADMINISTERS THE FIRST STAGE. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA CHANGED ELIGIBILITY RULES FOR EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS IN TWO WAYS. THAT HAVE INCREASED CASELOAD IN STAGES TWO AND THREE ARE THE COW WORKS PROGRAM SENSE. OR WHEN WE INCREASE THE INCOME THRESHOLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY A DECADE AND ESTABLISHED A PROCESS FOR UPDATING THE THRESHOLD EVERY YEAR. AND SECOND WE CHANGE PROGRAM RULES FOR THE PROGRAM SO THAT PARENTS CAN RECEIVE A TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY FOR CARE WHICH REALLY HELPS STABILIZE BOTH THE FAMILIES THE CHILDREN. AS WELL AS THE PROVIDERS. PRIOR TO THESE CHANGES NEW CASES AN ATTRITION OFFSET ONE ANOTHER SINCE THE CHANGE AS ATTRITION HAS BEEN. REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY ONE NEW CASES CONTINUED TO BE ADDED AS THEY HAPPEN HISTORICALLY. PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES WE ARE PROJECTING THAT AVERAGE MONTHLY CASELOADS AND BOTH STAGE TWO AND THREE COMBINED WILL BE ABOUT 29% HIGHER IN THE CURRENT YEAR. COMPARED TO TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE LAST YEAR BEFORE THAT CHANGE DIVING IN A BIT DEEPER FOR BOTH STAGE TWO AND STAGE. THREE CASELOAD INCREASE DEEPLY EACH MONTH AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN STAGE TWO HAS SLOWED DOWN SOMEWHAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS STAGE THREE CONTINUES TO GROW AT A FAST PACE. AS A RESULT OF UPDATED DATA WELL THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS ESTIMATING. THE CURRENT CASELOAD PROJECTION VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE ARE PROJECTING A CONTINUED INCREASE IN CASE I'D FOR BOTH PROGRAMS AND THE BUDGET YEAR. NOTABLY IN STAGE. THREE STAGE THREE RECENT DATA SINCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS XIN CONTINUOUS AND SIGNIFICANT GROWTH SIR BUDGET YOUR PROJECTIONS ESTIMATE A SLIGHT SLOW DOWN BUT STILL SIZEABLE INCREASING CASELOAD. WITH AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ADDITIONAL CASES PER MONTH. THIS TRANSLATES TO A SHORTFALL OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND STATES THREE COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND NATIONAL AMOUNTS. FOR STAGE TWO WE ARE STILL ALLEN ANALYZING THE DATA AS IT COMES IN TO SEE IF WE WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATE LATER IN MAY THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU ON STAGE. TO THE KINGS CANYON STEEP GROWTH IN STAGE THREE REALLY IS THE RESULT MAINLY OF FAMILIES AS THEY MOVE FROM STAGE TO INTO STAGE. THREE AND AND SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PORTION OF THAT SECTION. THERE WAS A RECENT REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY. IS THE OF ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED. UPDATING THE RATES ACCORDINGLY. SIR FOR QUITE. WE HAVE BE WE HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY AND WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT IT AND WE WE WILL TAKE. ANY CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT OF WHAT THE MARKET RATE WILL MEAN FOR THE FIELD BACK WITH THE HAS THERE BEEN ANY SORT OF ASSESSMENT AS TO WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE IF WE IF WE UPDATED. WITH THE SURVEY WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY WITH US RIGHT NOW. THE STAFF NOTES ALSO. REFLECT THAT THERE'S SOME CONTINUED INEQUITIES AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO SOME PROVIDERS WHICH LIMIT THE POOL -- WILLING TO PROVIDE FLEXIBLE CARE DID YOU NOTE THAT -- COMMENT ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE AGENDA UNDER THE STAFF COMMENTS. IT'S IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF THE STIFF COMMENTS DO YOU. DO ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT POINT. ANYBODY WANT TO JUMP IN. DOES IT IN FACT DOES THE INEQUITY IN FACT THE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE IN FACT MEAN THAT THESE. KATE THESE LICENSE EXEMPT PROVIDERS OR UNWILLING OR UNABLE. TO OFFER PART DAY ARE FLEXIBLE HOURS EVEN IN THE FACE OF DEMAND. I THINK WE SEE BROADER ISSUES AND AND THEN ACCESSING CARE BECAUSE THEIR SCHEDULES TEAMS SO FREQUENTLY. AND THAT'S NOT JUST AT FOR LICENSE EXAM TO CARE THAT AFFECTS THEIR ACCESS TO CARE OVERALL. AND IS THERE OF A MOVE AFOOT TO ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES OR HAVE DID YOU MENTION THAT NIGHT. I DIDN'T CONNECT THE DOTS WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEM IT WOULD BE A PRETTY BAG POLICY CHANGE. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD NEED A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO DIVE ITO YOU AND WORK WITH ACROSS BOTH PARTNERS AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS. BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS AS YOU LOOK AT NEW FAMILIES TODAY AND A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES THAT ARE LOWER INCOME AT TEN TO WORK SHIFT SCHEDULE SO THEY MAY BE. IN RESTAURANTS OR HOTELS OR AND INDUSTRIES THAT REQUIRE SHIFT WORK AND SAID BECAUSE AT THAT THEIR SCHEDULES ARE VARIABLE. I ASSUME IS A BUDGET IMPLICATION OF TO THAT AS WELL. HANDING ON HOW WE WOULD DECIDE TO ADDRESS THAT THERE WOULD BE. WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION [inaudible] ANY QUESTIONS. NO GOOD THANK YOU. LA -- DID THEY GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO FOLLOW UP DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS -- I WILL JUST NOTE ON YOUR ON YOUR LICENSE EXAM QUESTION ON YOUR MIDDLE THAT AND THE YES SO WE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- THAT WAS LOOKED AT AS PART OF FLASHERS BUDGET -- AND AND THERE IF THERE WILL BE A BUDGET IMPACT ON ON INCREASING THE RATES FOR LICENSE EXAM PROVIDERS HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STUFF IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LINE AGAIN. SIR DURING THE OFFER GOOD. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE. THANK YOU GOOD DISCUSSION. WILL MOVE ON TO THE PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION ISSUE NUMBER TWO PAGE. EIGHT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR STATE PRESCHOOL -- FELONY OF TO SHIFT. PRISONERS OKAY. THANK YOU OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. OF RENDITION ALL TEN THOUSAND FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL IS TO ADD THIRTY THOUSAND STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND SLOTS. EVERY YEAR -- IN ABOUT EQUAL AMOUNTS OF FUNDING TO COVER THIRTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL SLOTS TO PROVIDE THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE FOUR YEAR OLD AS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL ELIO -- SO I'LL START ON PAGE SIX OF THE HANDOUT BUT I WAS SPEAKING FROM EARLIER -- AND JUST TO GIVE SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM CURRENTLY SERVES THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS -- FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES CHILDREN CAN PARTICIPATE IN EITHER THE PART AND PART DAY PRESCHOOL OR THE FULL DAY PROGRAM. THE PARTY PROGRAM IS AT LEAST THREE HOURS THE FULL DAY PROGRAM IS BETWEEN SIX AND A HALF TO TEN HOURS -- TEN AND HALF HOURS THE THE HOURS A CHILD IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE BEYOND THE THREE HOURS OF THE PARTY PROGRAM ALIGNS WITH THE PARENTS WORK OR SCHOOL SCHEDULE. THE FULL DAY PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY HAS TO KEY OBJECTIVES THE FIRST IS TO PROMOTE -- KINDERGARTEN READINESS AND THE SECOND IS TO HELP LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES WITH THEIR CHILD CARE NEEDS. STATE PRESCHOOLS OFFERED BY SEVERAL TYPES OF PROVIDERS THERE'S LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ELEAZAR WHICH ARE SCOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND THEN THERE'S NON ELEAZAR WHICH ARE TYPICALLY NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- BECAUSE SOMETIMES CITY GOVERNMENTS -- THE FIGURE SHOWS THE FIGURE HERE SHOWS THAT A GREATER SHARE OF NON ELLIE A SLOTS ARE FULL DAY SLOT THE RELATIVE TO ON THE ELLIE A SPOT. ELEAZAR FOR ELLIE IS THE BOOK OF THE SLOTS THAT THEY SERVE OUR PART GAME. ANON ELLIE GAYS WHO SERVE ABOUT A THIRD OF ALL STATE BE SCHOOL SLOTS. OF THE SLOTS THAT NOT ONLY A SIR ABOUT HALF OF THEM ARE FULL DAY AND HALF OF THEM ARE PART DAY. SO MOVING ON TO PAGE SEVEN THIS FIGURE SHOWS THAT -- THE STATE IS A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW THE STATE HAS INCREASED FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL SLOT SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. I'M SO THE STATE OUT IN MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FLIGHTS AND IT THIS IS AN INCREASE OF 70% OVER THE TIME PERIOD. SO ON PAGE EIGHT DESCRIBES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS WITH REGARD TO STATE PRESCHOOL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- ALREADY DESCRIBED ON THE FOR THE FIRST BILL THAT I HAVE HERE BUT I WILL I'M DISCUSS THE SECOND BUILDING THE THIRD BOLD HERE IS -- SO THE SECOND PIECE OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL IN ADDITION TO ADDING SLOTS IS EXPANDING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE FULL DAY SLOTS -- SO ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT THAT FAMILIES HAVE TO WORK OR GO TO SCHOOL IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT SIX AND A HALF TO TEN HOUR DAY PORTION. AND THE THIRD THING THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES IS IT SHIFTS UP THE CHIPS ALL FUNDING FOR NON SO STATE PRESCHOOL IS FUNDED WITH ON TO FUND SOURCES NIGHT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND ON PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT AND IT'S SHIFTING SOME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OUTSIDE OF THEN -- OUTSIDE OF NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AND ELLIE A SLIGHT ENTIRELY WITH NON NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS. I'M SO MOVING ON TO PAGE NINE IT DESCRIBES OUR ASSESSMENT. I'M SO WE THINK EXPANDING SE PRESCHOOL FOR NON ELOISE IS LIKELY TO ADDRESS THE ADDRESS WORKING FAMILIES NEEDS TO WIN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH PROVIDERS -- ALTHOUGH THAT WE SO THE STATE DOESN'T COLLECT DATA SPECIFICALLY ON THIS BUT OUR CONVERSATION WITH PROVIDERS WAS NON ELLIE ACE TEND TO OFFER OPERATE LONGER PROGRAMS TEN OUR PROGRAMS TWELVE HOUR PROGRAMS PER DAY. COMPARED TO SADDAM'S COMPARED TO ELLIE A PROGRAMS WICH WERE TYPICALLY SIX AND A HALF HOUR DAY SOMETHING MORE LINE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE SCHOOL DAY. ON THE SECOND THING IS THAT STATE PROVIDES THE STATE AND PROVIDERS NOT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND AS QUICKLY AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES AND THIS IS RECOGNIZING SOME ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH ADMINISTERING THE SLOTS. AND ALSO AT THE AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL WITH PROVIDERS BEING INTERESTED AND BEING ABLE TO PICK UP THE SLOT -- SO. IN SLOTS ON THE LAST TIME SLOTS REMARKS FOR THEM IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THEY THEY USE ALTHOUGH SLOTS BUT THEY RECEIVED A MUCH SMALLER AMOUNT IT WAS ONLY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED COMPARED TO THE TEN THOUSAND SLOTS AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. I'M IN THIS BUDGET. THE THIRD POINT HERE IS A FACILITIES ARE A KEY COMPONENT -- FOR EXPANDING THAT WE'VE HEARD ON THAT THIS THAT THIS COULD BE QUITE CHALLENGING FOR PROVIDERS IN ORDER -- TO IN ORDER TO SERVE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN. THERE SOME LOCAL BARRIERS SUCH AS THE OWNING REQUIREMENTS THAT EXIST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND ALSO SOME STATE -- FROM STATE -- ADMINISTRATIVE THINGS THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO PRIOR TO SERVING MORE CHILDREN SUCH AS I'M GETTING LICENSE MY COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING. ON PAGE. TEN A WE NOTE THAT WE THINK THE WORK REQUIREMENT IS REASONABLE TO PRIORITIZE SCHOOL DAYS AND THIS IS TO MAKE THIS IS THIS ENSURE THAT HELP ENSURE THAT A FULL DAY SLOT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE FOR FAMILIES THAT NEED A FULL DAY FUND. IN UGANDA TIONAL CARE COMPONENT. AND THE LAST THING HERE IS REMOVING THE WORK REQUIREMENT COULD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. I'M IT'S XPANDING -- THE POOL OF ELIGIBLE OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN FOR THE FULL DAY COMPONENT AND UP AND A FULL DAY SLOT COSTS ABOUT DOUBLE THE COST OF A PART A SLOT. TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF THE WOOD SOME OF THE PARTY SLOTS WOULD CONVERT TO FULL DAY SLOTS -- AND IF IT HALF OF THE PAST A PATH OF THE PARTY THOUGHT CONVERTED TO FULL THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD COST AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO SERVE THE SAME NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND ABSENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS IT COULD HAVE THE UNINTENDED EFFECT OF SERVING FEWER CHILDREN IN THE PROGRAM. ON PAGE ELEVEN WE DESCRIBE A RECOMMENDATIONS. THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S A LONG TERM GOAL OF SERVING ALL LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS A WORST WE'RE RECOMMENDING FUNDING FEWER SLOTS IN THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTING THE SCHOOL. I'M JUST GIVEN THE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES THAT I'VE MENTIONED WERE RECOMMENDING A MORE MODEST NUMBER OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVIEW HOW MANY SLOTS WERE TAKING UP IN THAT FIRST YEAR AND DECIDE ON A ON A AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER FOR THE FUTURE. FOR THE FUTURE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS FALL. A WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING STARTING THE SLOTS MID YEAR THIS WOULD GIVE TIME FOR CD E. -- TO TO REVIEW AND APPROVE APPLICATIONS FOR PROVIDERS -- TO TO DO SOME OF THE LOGISTICAL THINGS TO GET THEIR FACILITIES GET THEIR FACILITIES LICENSE HIGHER STOCK AND IN LITTLE CHILDREN. WE'RE RECOMMENDING WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING PROVIDING ONGOING FUNDING TO SIT TO ASSIST WITH FACILITY ISSUES WERE RECOMMENDING PROVIDING FOR MILLION -- ON GOING TO LOCAL PLANNING COUNCILS TO ASSIST PROVIDERS WITH FACILITY ISSUES -- AND WE'RE A WITH FUNDS LOCAL PLANNING COUNCILS WOULD HIRE FACILITY SPECIALISTS TO HELP PROVIDERS IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL FACILITIES. WE'RE RECOMMENDING RETAINING THE WORK REQUIREMENT FOR FULL DAY PROGRAMS AND GIVING NEW SLOTS TO PROVIDERS OPERATING AT LEAST ATTEND -- GIVING YOU SOUGHT TO PROVIDERS OPERATING AT LEAST A TEN HOUR DAY AND THESE TWO RULES TOGETHER WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT THE PRESCHOOL SLOTS WERE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES. AND WE DO AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF NON ELEAZAR OF A FUNDING NINE ELLIE A SPOT FROM ONE FUND SOURCE WE THINK THIS GIVES ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY -- THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO GO FURTHER BY FINDING IT ALL OF STATE PRESCHOOL WITH ONE ONE FUND SOURCE BECAUSE IT STILL IS -- PARTIALLY MIX WITH PROPOSITION NINETY AND NOT NINETY FUNDING. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. WELL I'D BE INTERESTED IN SOME COMMENT ABOUT THE SHIFT AWAY FROM THE WORK THAT WERE MADE IN THE IMPACT BUT I SUPPOSE. I SHOULD LOOK. FINISH THE PANELS FINISH THE PRESENTATION SO CITY. THE THIRD SARAH. JUST TO CONFUSE YOU ARE. SO I HAVE YOUR DO YOU DOES IT WORLD HERITAGE YEAH. DOING A GREATJOB BECAUSE YOU JUST START TALKING AND I DON'T NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHO TO CALL. IT WORKS VERY WELL. AND MY ADVANCED AGE YES MA'AM. SO AT FURTHER EXPANDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IS A VERY STRONG FIRST STEP TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES THAT REACH RESEARCH SHOWS ASKING CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. BUT WE WOULD ALSO SAY THAT WE THINK IT'S ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND EARLY ACCESS TO EDUCATION. WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL GREAT NEED FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO INFANT AND TODDLER CARE AND MANY OF OUR COUNTY STATEWIDE. OVERALL THE NUMBER OF SUBSIDIZED THOUGHTS FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS DECLINED BY 26% BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH IS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STOCKS. WE APPRECIATE THE SUBSTANTIAL RATE INCREASE IN THE RATES FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED LAST YEAR. WHICH WOMEN NOW MAKE IT EASIER FOR PROVIDERS TO OFFER SUBSIDIZED HIM INTO OTHER SPACES. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CURRENT FUNDING FOR SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING CARE ONLY SUPPORTS ABOUT 16% OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS FROM ELIGIBLE FAMILIES. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING A REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL CHILD CARE TITLE FIVE INFANT TODDLER PROGRAMS. AND WHILE WE ONLY HAVE EIGHT MILLION IN FUNDING TO PROVIDE. THE APPLICATIONS REQUESTED A HUNDRED NINE MILLION. AT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN DRESSING THIS ISSUE WE ARE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH YOU TO IDENTIFY THE BEST WAYS TO INVEST IN THIS MUCH NEEDED AREA IN THE FUTURE. AB MORE DEEPLY INTO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCREASE ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL. WE KNOW THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS MUCH NEEDED AS MANY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES STILL LACK ACCESS TO QUALITY EARLY LEARNING AND CARE. TO GIVE YOU A QUICK BREAK DOWN. BASED ON CENSUS DATA WE KNOW THERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA. OF THESE FOUR YEAR OLDS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND ARE FROM FAMILIES WITH INCOMES BELOW 85% OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME WHICH MEANS THEIR INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR OUR PROGRAMS. AT THESE LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLD ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND ARE FROM LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES WHICH MEANS THEY WOULD CURRENTLY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. EVER OUR PROGRAMS SERVE ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. OR ABOUT 37% OF ALL OF THE LOW INCOME CHILDREN. IN ADDITION TO CALIFORNIA STATE PIECE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; PROGRAM WHERE WE&lt;/c&gt;</u> KNOW THE QUALITY IS HIGH AND THE STANDARDS ARE INTENTIONALLY ALIGNED WITH WHAT PERMITS CHILDRE'S DEVELOPMENT. WE ALSO SERVE ABOUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS AND OTHER CD PROGRAMS. AND ANOTHER HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER. WE APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE MADE IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO EXPAND STATE PRESCHOOL. ADDING ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND NEW FULL DAY OR THIRTY THOUSAND A NEW TWENTY THOUSAND IN THE PAST COUPLE YARS THEY WERE VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THESE NEW THOUGHTS ARE FULL DAY FULL YEAR. SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO ALLOW ALL LOW INCOME CHILDREN TO ACCESS THAT FULL DAY FULL YEAR QUALITY PROGRAM. REGARDLESS OF THE PARENTS PARTICIPATION AND WORK FORCE ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL. THIS CHANGE WITH A LINE AS WITH THE FEDERAL HEAD START REQUIREMENTS AND WOULD PROMOTE CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS SUPPORTING WORKING PARENTS NEEDS FOR EXPANDED HOURS. FINALLY THE FIND JEFF TO FIND ALL OF STATE PRESCHOOL AT NON ALLEY A L. E. EIGHTH AND I'M GONNA REFER TO THEM AS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SO THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THE OTHER. WITH NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND WILL GIVE OUR CBO PROVIDERS MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH THEIR FRIENDS SENSIBLE UNITE ALL NON ALLEY A FIND UNDER A SINGLE SOURCE. HOWEVER WE ARE STONE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR ABOUT SOME ASPECTS OF THAT PROPOSAL. WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM OUR RECENT EXPANSIONS WE LEARNED A LOT THROUGH THE RECENT AUGMENTATIONS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS TO EXPANDING STATE? PROGRAMS IN EACH YEAR OF EXPANSION INTEREST AMONG THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FOR SLOTS OUTPACED AVAILABLE FUNDS FOR THOSE THOUGHTS. OVERALL IN YEARS FOR EXPANSION FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE TO BOTH ELEAZAR. AND THE NON CBO SIDE CBO THE PIPE FOR MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF FULL DAY FULL YEAR SOUGHT. THAN ELEAZAR PRIDE. FOR SO FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE MADE AVAILABLE JUST OVER FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED FULL DAY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS TO ELEAZAR. AND TWELVE HUNDRED FULL DAY FULL YEAR TO THE CBO'S. OF THOSE THOUGHTS FOR THE ELEAZAR WE ONLY RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED FULL DAY FOR YEARS. HOWEVER AT THE SAME PER THE CBO'S WE RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN AS A REMINDER IF THERE IS ONLY MONEY. FOR ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THEY DEFINITELY OUTPACED. WHAT WE WERE AVAILABLE? YOU ALSO CAN SENIOR AGENDA THE ASKING AWARD FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEAR WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF AWARDING THE THOUGHT. THAT WERE AVAILABLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER REQUEST ON THE FULL DAY SPOT. FOR CBO'S THEN WE CAN FIND TO ILLUSTRATE THE ACUTENESS OF THE GAPS CBO'S REQUESTED. OVER TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FULL DAY FULL YEAR SPOTS WHICH WOULD NEED TO BE SUPPORTED WITH ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION AND NON PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND IN ADDITION TO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FIND. HOWEVER ONLY ONE POINT TWO MILLION AND NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND IS AVAILABLE THROUGH A CONTRACTOR. SO WE WILL HAVE TO TELL MANY OF OUR CONTRACTOR SEEN THAT THEY WERE NOT APPROVED FOR EXPANSION. BECAUSE THERE WASN'T THE FUNDING AVAILABLE. THE WHY HAVEN'T ELEAZAR CRIED FOR THESE FUNDS THAT THE QUESTION WE COMMONLY CAM. WE HEARD FROM OUR CONTRACTORS THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR AT LEAST A OFFER FULL DAY FULL YEAR PROGRAMS FOR SEVERAL REASONS INCLUDING. THE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES ESPECIALLY SINCE MANY STAFF LA PROGRAMS ARE COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED AND THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THIS. FOR MOST OF THE STATE. THERE IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE FOR PROGRAMS TO OFFER TO PARTY PROGRAMS DURING THE DAY INSTEAD OF ONE FULL DAY PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. FOR ADDITIONALLY ELEAZAR CAN EARN MORE FROM SERVING FOUR YEAR OLDS IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THEN THEY CAN EARN FROM SERVING CHILDREN IN THE STATE SCHOOL PROGRAM. TKO ALSO HAS BUREAUCRAT MEANT AROUND SOME OF THE STANDARDS FOR RATIO THE GROUP SIZE THINGS THAT DRIVE UP THE COST A LITTLE BIT. THERE'S ALSO A LACK OF FACILITIES. THIS COME UP AS A BARRIER ALL THE TIME FROM ALL OF OUR PROVIDERS AND AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE THE DRESSING IN THE BUDGET MOVING FORWARD IS KEY. SHEET INCLUSION OF THIS AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S KEY INFRASTRUCTURE KEYS. WE ALSO HEAR FROM SOME ELEAZAR THAT FULL DAY FULL YEAR OPERATIONS ARE DIFFICULT SINCE OUR SCHOOL FACILITIES ARE CLOSED DURING THE SUMMER. HOWEVER WE WOULD WANT TO BALANCE IS CONCERNED WITH BUT WORKING FAMILIES NEED MOVING FORWARD. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR EXPANDING STATE PRESCHOOL ALLOCATE SLOTS TO COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED OVER THE YEARS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND SERVICES AND ARE INTERESTED IN EXPANDING. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE FULL DAY IN THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OFTEN MEANS TEN HOURS OR MORE WHICH REALLY ALIGNS WITH WHAT ARE WORKING FAMILIES NEED [inaudible] AND SO AS WE LOOK AT ALL OF THIS WE KNOW THAT MET THAT DEMAND IS THAT PAY STATE WE THINK THAT PAIRING THIS THOUGHT INCREASE WITH THE FACILITIES WILL HELP A LOT. AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HEAR A LOT IS THE WORK FORCE WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT WHEN WITH ALL OF YOU IN A LITTLE BIT. SO I THINK IT WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WELL MAYBE YOU YOU PROBABLY COVER THIS COULD YOU JUST GO BACK OVER FOR ME THE MAYBE RESPOND TO THE LA IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORK REQUIREMENT ISSUE. FOR COULD SOMEONE [inaudible] SURE. SO THE ADMINISTRATION'S ONE OF THE MEASURES BIG GOALS FOR THIS ENTIRE PACKAGE IS INCREASING ACCESS TO THE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS FOR OUR MOST. VULNERABLE YOUNGEST LEARNERS SO REMOVING THE WORK REQUIREMENTS. IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD REALLY HELP FAMILIES WHO NEED SUPPORT FROM THESE PROGRAMS AND ARE FACING MORE OF THOSE INTERMITTENT OF WORK SCHEDULES. AND REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE PROGRAMS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE EXPANDED ACCESS SPEAK BY REMOVING THE WORK REQUIREMENT SO THAT IS THE MAIN MOTIVATION BEHIND. THIS PARTICULAR CHANGE HOW HOW DOES THAT IMPACT HOW DOES THAT INTERFACE WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF SLOTS I MEAN ARE YOU I THINK ALEJO'S CONCERN WAS. IF YOU ELIMINATE THE WORK REQUIREMENT. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FOLKS COMPETING FOR THE SAME NUMBER OF FLOOD STOOD I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY. AND THAT COULD. HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR ON OUR OUR GOAL. IN MY UNDERSTANDING A GROUP MEMBER. YES WE BELIEVE THAT BY TAKING AWAY THE WORK REQUIREMENTS GOING TO RESULT IN MUCH BETTER RESULTS FOR OUR FAMILIES THAT WOULD OFFSET SOME OF THESE ADVERSE. OBSERVATIONS ARE BEING MADE BY THE LA. WELL WHAT ABOUT THE THE INJECTION OF AN INCREASED NUMBER OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND WELL IN MY NUMBER. THIRTY THOUSAND **** OVER THREE YEARS TO SERVE THE LOW INCOME FORTY FOUR YEAR OLD. OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD THE CONCERNED AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS TOO MUCH IN TWO SHORT OF TIME. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE NUMBER OF SLOTS SO WE ARE PROPOSING IT IS IN A SLOW AND METHODICAL WAY IT IS TEN THOUSAND SLOTS. EACH YEAR AND I WOULD I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT IT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER PROPOSALS TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE NTIRE SYSTEM AS IS EXPANSION CONTINUES SO WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DOLLARS IN THE EXPANSION. EXPANSION OF THE PRESCHOOLS LOTS WE BELIEVE THAT AS WE ALL WORK TOGETHER IT WILL HELP CREATE THAT FOUNDATION THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A SUSTAINABLE EXPANSION OF SLOTS. AND WE WHICH IS SAD BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THAT DEMAND FROM THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE MORE PRESCHOOL AND TO PROVIDE THE FULL DAY. THERE'S A LOT TO CONSIDER AROUND HOW TO SUPPORT THAT AND HOW TO ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. EVERYWHERE SO FAMILIES CAN ACCESS THEM THE THINGS DE CONSIDER AROUND ELECTRONIC MONITOR TEEN ELECTRONIC OR PHASE THINGS THAT WOULD REALLY MAKE IT EASIER ON THE CONTRACTORS AND EASIER ON THE DEPARTMENT ASWE HAVE TO ADDRESS A LOT OF APPLICATIONS. WE'VE ALSO OBSERVE THAT FOR EXISTING CONTRACTORS THAT CAN TAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. TO BE AWARDED THERE'S SOMETHING AROUND HIRING STAFF REALLY MAKING SURE THEY GET THAT PROGRAM LICENSED IN UP AND GOING. FOR BRAND NEW CONTRACTORS WHO'VE NEVER WORKED WITH CD I CAN TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE STATE. WE FEEL THAT ALL PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY THIS NEW ONES WOULD BENEFIT FROM MARCUS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND TRAINING AND SUPPORT ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT A STATE CONTRACT HOW TO ENSURE GOOD STEWARDSHIP OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HOW TO BEST SUPPORT THE CHILDREN FAMILIES IN THIS PROGRAM. THEY'RE REALLY GETTING ADDITIONAL TRAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BOTH AHEAD OF TIME TO HELP ADDRESSES QUESTIONS CONCERNS BEFORE AN RV WOULD BE RELEASED. AND THEN SUPPORTING PROGRAMS AS THEY WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD WAY A STRONG WAY TO CONSIDERING COMPANY KNOWS THOUGHT INCREASES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. TO A CD HAS A PLAN. TO IMPLEMENT THE TEN THOUSAND PER YEAR UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. WE FEEL THAT GETTING OUT IN FRONT OF IT WITH ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE GOOD. WE DO FEEL THAT IF WE REALLY ESPECIALLY AS WE KEEP INCREASING WHEN WE WOULD NEED TO INCREASE THAT OTHER PIECES OF OUR SUPPORT. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FULLY TO AT SO IS THAT PEACE IN INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET SOMEWHERE. I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE IN THE FACE OF THE AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS IS AN OPEN ITEM SO WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE CONCLUSION OF THIS PHASE OF OUR BUDGET KABUKI DANCE. THAT THAT ALL THE PIECES OF THE BUDGET OR ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO IN FACT IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN TO ADD THIRTY THOUSAND PLUS OVER THREE YEARS SO. TO SAY THAT THAT'S A GOAL AND WE PUT IT IN THE BUDGET WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE CD HAS A FUNDING NECESSARY. TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS AND THAT WAS. THAT WAS MY THE GENESIS OF MY QUESTION. YES -- IT IT JUST. THAT WAS I GUESS THAT WAS A QUESTION BUT I GUESS IT COULD BE A STATEMENT IF YOU WANT TO WAIT NANCE RELATED. I I CAN COMMENT ON SO -- WE WE DEFINITELY AGREE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE LOTS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT CD HAS THE CAPACITY. TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ON THEIR RULED OUT EFFECTIVELY AND THERE IS. THERE ARE. THERE IS A PROPOSITION IN THE BUDGET TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF POSITIONS THAT WE'RE GIVING TO SPECIFICALLY TO THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE DIVISION FOR FOR THEIR CURRENT WORKLOAD -- AND AS WELL AS THE FORTHCOMING WORKLOAD WITH ALL THESE VARIOUS BUDGET PROPOSALS. THAT ENTERED THANK YOU SIR LEVEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IS THERE. A CONCERN THAT IF WE ELIMINATE THE WORK REQUIREMENT AS PROPOSED THAT WE MIGHT BE ADVANTAGE IN THE WRONG FAMILIES THAT WE MIGHT BE ADVANTAGE IN FAMILIES WHERE THERE'S ONLY ONE WORKING PARENT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE PARENTS WHO HAVE ARE BOTH WORKING. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT PARK WERE PRIORITIZING SO IS THERE ANY CONCERN THAT BY ELIMINATING. THE WORK REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM. THAT THAT IS A CONCERN FOR THE WAY THAT THE STATE PRESCHOOL PRIORITIZATION IS IS CURRENTLY IN LAW IS IT'S AN AD CODE OF HOW FAMILIES WILL BE PRIORITIZE FIRST -- TO WITH FAMILIES REFERRED BY CPS ON SECOND TO FOUR YEAR OLDS BY LOWEST INCOME TO HIGHEST INCOME AND THEN THREE YEAR OLDS -- BY INCOME I'M SO IN WITHOUT CURRENT PRIORITIZATION SCHEDULE ON THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN AMEND THAT PRIORITIZATION THAT CURRENT PRIVATIZATION I THINK YOUR CONCERN IS VALID. SO SO I WOULD JUST LIKE US TO LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE HELPING THE FAMILIES THAT NEED HELP MOST. OF AND THEN SECONDLY. I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT -- I THINK THAT FINANCE I THINK THAT THAT IS A GOOD IDEA TO ONLY INCREASE THE RESCHOOL SLOTS BY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BECAUSE WE DON'T USE ALL THE SLOTS THAT WERE GIVEN EVERY YEAR CORRECT. DON'T MANY OF THEM GO UNUSED BECAUSE MY CONCERN WAS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WINE TO ADD. TEN THOUSAND WE WOULDN'T WE ARE USING EVERYTHING WE HAVE NOW SO [inaudible] ARE ARE WE USING ALL THE SLOTS WE HAVE AVAILABLE. BUT YOU'RE CORRECT THERE IS SOME -- THERE ARE SOME SAVING THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM NOW. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING THE SLOTS WERE WE MOST NEED THEM [inaudible] THAT'S ALL. THE MAJORITY OF THE THOUGHTS THAT HAVE STUCK ON AND USE THAT WOULD BE PUTTING OUT AGAIN OUR FOR SPECIFIC FOR ALLIE ACE ONLY. AND SO THE PART THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR FULL DAY FULL YEAR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THOSE ALWAYS HAVE A MORE DEMAND THAN WE HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THEM. SO COULD WE MOVE. ONE TO THE OTHER. I MEAN  KNOW ONCE CONSIDERABLY MORE EXPENSIVE BUT I I JUST THINK WE NEED TO FIND A WAY. TO GET TO WHERE FAMILIES NEED US AND NOT LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE SO TO SPEAK WITH SLOTS BEING UNFILLED. CERTAINLY PLEASE TEN THOUSAND SLOTS ON THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ART SPECIFICALLY FOR A NON. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THEIR FUNDED BY NON PROPOSITION NINETY DOLLARS SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE -- THAT MISS NOBLE MORGAN POINTED OUT. TO TO SHOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PENT UP DEMAND FOR SLOTS AT NON LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FOOD IS TARGETED IN THAT WAY. OKAY THANK YOU ONE ONE THING I WILL NOTE ON YOUR ON YOUR COMMENT - ADDRESSING STATE PRESCHOOL THROUGH ONE FUNDING SOURCE WOULD ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING SAVINGS THAT ARE ONLY EXPLICITLY EARMARKED FOR ELEAZAR ONE FUNDING SOURCE WOULDN'T YOUR MARK THE FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC AGENCY OR FOR SPECIFIC ENTITIES TO USE THE STATE PRESCHOOL SLOT SO THAT WE COULD BE ADDRESSED THAT WAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYTHING FURTHER PANELS IN THIS. ONE ANYTHING FURTHER IN A QUOTE FOR THE QUESTION SEVERAL I JUST WANTED TO I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON ELIGIBILITY MMA MAYBE I MEAN THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT RIGHT YOU KNOW -- WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT WE MAY BE LEAVING THINGS ON THE TABLE BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS ON WINDOWS AND INCREDIBLE DEMAND OUT THERE. AND I WONDER -- YOU KNOW IT. IN THIS CAN OPEN UP OF A CAN OF WORMS IN TERMS OF COST BUT AND BUT IS THERE. AT A TIME TO LOOK. TAKE A GIVEN THE EVER INCREASING COST OF LIVING FOR EVERYBODY HOUSING EVERYTHING ELSE. TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY POLL FURTHER AND IF SO WHERE IS THAT CONVERSATION GOING WHERE WOULD WE TWEAK IT WORK YOU KNOW HOW HOW WOULD WE AND IT IS IT. IS THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENING ALL AND AND AND LIVING YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. JUST TO CLARIFY ARE YOU ARE YOU SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO INCOME ELIGIBILITY YEAH YEAH EXACTLY. WE DID INCREASE IN THIS PAST BUDGET YEAR THAT WILL TAKE PLACE AND STARTING JULY FIRST THAT WENT FROM 70% OF STATE MEDIAN INCOME TO COMMAND. ALL THE WAY UP 285% THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. NHà IS THERE OKAY. A. N. -- THE DROUGHT. I GUESS DOES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT COST OF LIVING FROM REGION TO REGION. SO IT'S BASED ON STATE MEDIUM INCOME SO IT TAKES SO WHEN SO IT IS ACTION AT THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT TO BASE IT ON THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME SO -- OF LOOKING AT A FEDERAL LEVEL IT TAKES AN ACCOUNT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A HIGHER COST OF LIVING IN ANOTHER PLACE BUT IT DOESN'T DO IT GEOGRAPHICALLY -- AMONG THE HIGHER COST COUNTIES RELATIVE TO LOWER COST AND THE REASON I ASK THAT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU GOT FOLKS LIVING IN OUR CITIES WHO. ARE READY ARE SPENDING. YOU KNOW A HALF OF THEIR INCOMES ON HOUSING [inaudible] AND CHEN ACOSTA LIVING IS SOAKED THROUGH THE ROOF AND THEN HAVING TO KID YOU KNOW ADDS ALL SORTS OF ADDITIONAL. PRESSURES -- AND THE COST. FOR YOU. MARKET RATE CHILD CARE IS SO EXPENSIVE. SO I IT JUST KINDA MAKES ME WONDER WHETHER THERE OUGHT TO BE A LITTLE BIT EXTRA FLEXIBILITY GIVEN TO THOSE PEOPLE LIVING IN. BUT IF WE HIGH COST AREAS OF THE STATE. I WHICH COULD WE DO THROUGH EXPECT EXPANDING -- ARE HAVE MORE A. P. VOUCHERS. WOULD THAT HELP IS CONCERNED. IF I COULD EITHER I WROTE THE LA I THINK SO I THINK WE DO HAVE -- WANT TO CARVE A DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF COST OF LIVING SO WE'D IN TERMS OF INCOME ELIGIBILITY LOOKING AT A FAMILIES INCOME WE DO NOT HAVE A REGIONALLY ADJUSTED -- CHRIS SECRETARY AS WE HAVE. 185% STATE ME IN INCOME WE DO IT JUST FOR A FAMILY A FAMILY SIZE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO MONTH ALL DOUBLE THAT IS NOT JUST ACROSS THE STATE. AND SO THAT DOES MEAN THAT IF YOU'RE NOT A HIGHER COST OF LIVING AREA MAYBE THAT. THERE THERE'VE BEEN SOME GOOD NEWS AND SOME OF THOSE AREAS MAYBE SOME FAMILIES. SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE THAT ARE NOT WHERE WE DO I JUST FOR COST OF LIVING IS ON THE OR WE JUST FOR REGIONAL COST IS ON THE THE COST OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF THE VOUCHERS -- ARE ARE PROVIDED BASED ON REGIONAL MARKET RATE SO IF YOUR IF YOU'RE AT A FAMILY THAT'S GOING -- TO GET OUT GET A CENTER SLOT IN THE BAY AREA VERSES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON YOU BECAUSE WE'RE PAYING WHATEVER THE COST IS -- BASED ON THAT REGIONAL MARKETS RIGHT SO THERE ARE THOSE THOSE DIFFERENCES THERE I THINK THE THE ISSUE THAT. THE ISSUE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW -- TO SERVICE CENTER IS IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE WE HAVE. RECENTLY CHANGE THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND ALSO THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME IS NOW IN STATUTE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTED AS WE GET NEW -- DATA FROM NEW NEW INCOME EVERY YEAR SO THERE IS A BUILT IN MECHANISM WHERE IT WON'T BE AS IT WAS IN THE PAST WHERE. WE HAVE FOR A LONG TIME WE WERE USING THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE MEDIAN INCOME -- TO TO TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY THAT PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED IN COURT AS WE ARE GOING TO BE UPDATING IT BUT THE THE THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVEN'T. OUT THERE ISN'T ANY SPECIFIC -- ISSUE-- CHANGES RELATED TO THE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE IN THE INCOME OF THE FAMILIES. YEAH I JUST THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM I I UNDERSTAND THAT MAY ADD A WHOLE THEIR LAYER OF COMPLICATION IN YOUR MAYBE IT'S NOT WORTH OPEN A CAN OF WORMS BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON THIS BUILDING IN OTHER COMMITTEES ABOUT -- THE THE RELENTLESS COST OF LIVING PRESSURES ON PEOPLE IT'S INJECTED INTO OUR WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOUSING AND WE'RE ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATED PRETTY RADICAL STUFF -- IN THAT SPACE AND IT IT JUST MAKES ME YOU KNOW. IN A BATTLE BABY MYSELF AND I'M I'M I'M NOW FACING ALL NEW ECONOMIC REALITIES FOR SO -- AND NOT THAT I MEAN TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR IN THESE PROGRAMS BUT BUT BUT YOU KNOW -- BUT IT BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES AND YOU KNOW I I'VE I'M JUST GETTING OF A REAL CRASH COURSE AND AND ALL THE COSTS ASSOCIATED AS I AS I TRY TO PLAN OUT FOR THE FUTURE AND AND I I REALLY DO WORRY ABOUT -- WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE LIVING IN IN IN PARTS OF LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO ETCETERA THAT -- THAT ARE JUST BARELY STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT. I IN IN AN EXPENSIVE PART OF THE WORLD. I AND AND NOW THEY HAVE A KID AND AND WHEN WE'RE NOT PROVIDING KIND OF A LITTLE BIT EXTRA HELP FOR THEM. I GET I GET THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR THE PROVIDER THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT I I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY GOOD FOLKS BEING LEFT ON THE TABLE HERE SO WE TALK ABOUT SLOTS NOT BEING FILLED. MAKES ME WONDER WHAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY THERE TO HELP. PEOPLE IN HIGH COST AREAS THAT MIGHT BE REALLY STRUGGLING. THAT WAS EXACTLY WHY WE ADDRESS THAT STATE MEANING COME LAST YEAR SO BEFORE THEY WOULD COME IN AT 70%. AND THEN THEY WOULD EXIT EIGHTY FIVE BUT INSTEAD WE SIDE -- IT WAS CHANGED SO THEY COULD COME IN AT EIGHTY FIVE AND THEN ACTS THAT. SAID THAT WAS -- SPECIFICALLY FOR THE HIGHER COST LEVINE AREAS THAT'S GREAT. LET ME ASK ONE FINAL QUESTION AND I'VE MET CITY I'M SURE YOU -- YOU SAID THIS AND I MISSED IT. WITH THE THIRTY THOUSAND SLOTS OVER THREE YEARS TO THE NON ELLIE A IS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DEMAND I MEAN WHAT'S THE UNMET DEMAND. IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION. DO WE KNOW NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO WOULD STILL BE ELIGIBLE WHO HAVEN'T WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SECURE OF THE FREE SCHOOL OF FULL TIME FOR ME TO SUGGEST WE HAVE THAT DATA. I I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW FAR WE'RE GOING TO GET WITH THE THIRTY THOUSAND THERE FOR JUST THE KERN AT THE FOUR YEAR OLDS. WE HAVE A A HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FRIEND LOW INCOME AND WORKING FAMILIES. WHEREAS WE WOULD HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE IF WE JUST LOOKED AT INCOME WE CURRENTLY SERVE A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND IF YOU LOOK AT THREE HUNDRED AND SIX VERSUS A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND THEY'RE STILL IT DEFINITELY AT LARGE SHARE OF FAMILIES WHO. ARE ELIGIBLE. ONE OF HIS PIECES I SIDE WITH WE REALLY WANT TO WORK ON WHERE PROGRAMS ARE ACROSS THE STATE AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S MORE ACCESS AND COMMUNITIES THAT TYPICALLY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE. TO OFFER THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. SO EVEN WITH THE EVEN WITH THE THE HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND THIRTY THOUSAND NOT GOING TO FILL THE NEED. CORRECT -- THAT RAIN. COULD COULD I COULD I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE THIRTY DOLLARS IN. A NUMBER THAT THAT IS A PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WAS AN ESTIMATE FROM THEM ON THE NOT THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL SLOTS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. TO SERVE. TO TAP ENOUGH LOTS OF THAT YOU WOULD SERVE ALL LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS IN THE STATE NOW THE NUMBERS ARE NOT. QUITE A THE THING I THINK THAT SEAT NUMBERS AT THE THE AFTER TO HIRE. THE COUPLE REASONS WHY THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT ONE IS THAT THE THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE. THERE ARE SOME CHILDREN WHO FOR EXAMPLE ARE ENROLLED IN HEAD START PROGRAMS THAT ARE FEDERALLY RUN THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD WE DON'T DO A GOOD JOB OF COMBINING DATA SOURCES SO THAT WE CAN. UNDERSTAND HOW MANY OF THOSE HEAD START STUDENTS -- ARE ARE BEING SERVED THERE IN ARE NOT ALSO. SERVED AS THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND THEN THERE IS WITH ALMOST ANY BOB PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AT ANY OF THE OF THESE KINDS OF EARLY. EDUCATION PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- YOU DON'T HAVE ALL A WANT THIS THE THE THE SLIGHT EVEN IF EVEN IF IT'S AVAILABLE SO THERE IS SOME KIND OF SET A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT YOU MIGHT. HAVE THAT THAT NOT ALL STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TEND FOR EXAMPLE NOT EVERY. NOT NOT EVEN EVERY L. G. NOT EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA TEND THE PUBLIC KINDERGARTEN FOR EXAMPLE -- SO YOU HAVE SOME SIMILAR EXPECTATIONS IN THE PRESCHOOL SIDE SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE THIRTY THOUSAND WAS AN ATTEMPT. TO TO COME UP WITH WHAT INCREASED IS NECESSARY FOR STATE PRESCHOOL SO THAT WE WOULD BE AT THE STATE SERVING ALL LOW INCOME CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND WHOSE FAMILIES ARE INTERESTED IN RECEIVING A SLOT GOT IT IN ME THAT. THAT HELPED. IF I MAY ASK ON THE DAILY -- BUT THAT HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS TO SERVE ALL LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS SO THE THIRTY THOUSAND WAS JUST AN ESTIMATE OF THOSE NOT BEING SERVED AT THE TO TRY TO GET THERE YES. SO AS I'M CERTAIN WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR OUR DATA COLLECTION AS WE ARE AS I'VE LEARNED ACROSS THE ENTIRE EDUCATION SPECTRUM. PERFECT I WAS GONNA SAY THAT WAS% THE ACTUALLY HAD ON A PERFECTLY WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA CHALLENGES AROUND AND DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS OF CHILDREN. THE UNDERSTANDING WHERE CHILDREN ARE NOT THEY'RE BEING SERVED BY HEAD START FOR SAYS AS STATE PROGRAM ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WERE ABLE TO GET TO VERY EASILY FELT THE LA AHEAD I'M NOT CORRECTLY. AND EARLY WE HAVE DATA CHALLENGES PRES THROUGH CAREERS SO I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL AND IT JUST TO GO BACK OVER ONE OF MY DATA POINTS. WE DO SERVE ABOUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN OTHER CD PROGRAMS THAT THEY MAY BE AND CAL WORKS OR USING A VOUCHER. TAXES THAT AND THEN ANOTHER HUNDRED THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION. WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT -- ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER THREE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ONE TIME INVESTMENT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. A ONE TIME FOR A VARIETY OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS DEDICATED TO A STRATEGIC MASTER PLAN THAT IS GOING. TO BE USED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE THESE GAPS SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY -- BUT ALSO TO BUILD UPON ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY MY PREVIOUS STUDIES AND TO PROVIDE A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION AND TO AID IN THEIR DECISION MAKING -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PATH OF EXPANDING CHILDCARE AND AND UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME ALSO INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION -- FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT -- MONEY WILL BE USED TO HELP MOVE -- CARE PROFESSIONALS ALONG THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONTINUING. AND THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WE USE FOR US SUBSIDIZE CHILDCARE. BUILDINGS OUT NON LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THANK YOU HELLO. LET'S ALL BE STARTING ON PAGE TWELVE THE LA -- HAND OUT I'M SO THIS PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT THE IN THE TOPIC AREAS WHERE THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED -- SOMEONE TIME IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES SO WITH REGARDS TO WORK OUT TO IT. WITH REGARD TO THE CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL WORK FORCE -- CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL WORKERS MUST MEET CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND HE'S VERY FIVE FIVE PROVIDER TYPE AND THE POSITION THAT THE EMPLOYER HAS WITHOUT PROVIDER. WITH -- WITH REGARDS TO FACILITIES WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT A FACILITY ARRANGEMENTS OF PROVIDERS BUT FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH PROVIDERS THEY TEND TO HAVE THREE COMMON FACILITY ARRANGEMENTS. AND THE FIRST WOULD BE PROVIDERS ON TECH COULDN'T LEASE AT SUBSIDIZED RATE SO THIS WOULD BE A PROVIDER HAVING A PARTNERSHIP WITH A PUBLIC ENTITY ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM PROVIDERS IS THAT THEY'RE PAYING ONE DOLLAR A YEAR TO WRITE FACILITIES FROM A CITY GOVERNMENT. ON THE OTHER -- ARRANGEMENT COULD BE LEASING AT MARKET RENT THEIR THEIR LEASING OF A SPACE AND PAYING MARKET. A MARKET RATE RENT FOR THAT SPACE AND THEN THE OTHER ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE OWNING EITHER EITHER PAYING A MORTGAGE OR THEY PAID OFF THE MORTGAGE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR MANY YEARS -- PAGE -- THIRTEEN DESCRIBES SOME OF THE SPECIAL STATEWIDE PLANNING EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THESE INCLUDE THE ASSEMBLY IS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION -- ON EARLY EDUCATION THAT BEGAN MEETING -- TWO YEARS AGO AND RECENTLY RELEASED A DRAFT SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. ANOTHER WORK GROUP -- PUBLISHED A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THE RATE SYSTEM -- CD E. WAS -- THAT SAID THE CD IS SERVICE IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND A STRATEGIC PLAN THROUGH THE PRESCHOOL DEVELOPING GRANT THAT THE STATE WAS RECENTLY AWARDED -- AND THEN THERE IS A AND OTHERS A RESEARCH AND HE WORKING ON A WORK FOR CITY -- THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME REGIONAL INFORMATION AND STATEWIDE INFORMATION ON THE ON WHAT THE WORK FORCE THAT EARLY THE THE CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL WORKFORCE LOOKS LIKE -- IN CALIFORNIA BOTH REGIONALLY AND STATEWIDE AND LATE -- TWENTY TWENTY ON PAGE. FOURTEEN DE IS THE GOVERNOR'S A SUMMARY OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DISCUSSES CONTENT ON THIS PAGE SO I MOVE ON TO PAGE. FIFTEEN I'M SORRY THIS IS START THEIR DISCUSSION FIFTEEN STARTS OUR DISCUSSION ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S ONE TIME INITIATIVES. A WE THINK THE WORK FORCE AND FACILITY ISSUES ARE KEY THESE ARE THINGS THAT COMMONLY COME UP AS BIG AREAS OF CONCERN FOR CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS -- OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE STATE LACKS SOME DATA TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON HOW THE STATE WOULD PRIORITIZE AND TARGET THE FUNDS AND USE THEM EFFECTIVELY. A WITH REGARD TO THE WORK FORCE PROPOSAL THE STATE DOES IT KNOW WHAT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS NEED ADDITIONAL CHILDCARE PERSONAL WORKERS WE DON'T HUNT AND WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ON THE EDUCATION ATTAINMENT LEVELS OF THESE EMPLOYEES -- SOME OF THAT INFORMATION WILL COME -- AS THAT AS THAT RESEARCH GROUP WILL RELEASE THEIR STUDY BUT THAT'S COMING IN LATE. TWENTY TWENTY WITH REGARD TO THE FACILITY PROPOSAL THE STATE DOESN'T COLLECT INFORMATION. ON THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO DETERMINE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACILITY CHALLENGES FACING PROVIDERS OR THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST CHALLENGE AS AND THEN WE ALSO THINK ANOTHER PLAN IS DUPLICATIVE OF MANY OF THE RECENT EFFORTS -- AROUND AROUND PLANNING AND STRATEGIC PLANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE CHILD CARE AND PRE SCHOOL SYSTEM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS MIGHT OVERLAP SIGNIFICANTLY WITH WHAT WHAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE ARE UNDER WAY. ON PAGE SIXTEEN IS OUR RECOMMENDATION OF FOR THE ONE TIME IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE WE'RE RECOMMENDING GETTING BETTER INFORMATION BEFORE FUNDING AN INITIATIVE SO HOLD OFF ON SPENDING THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IMMEDIATELY -- CONSIDER SETTING ASIDE SOME AMOUNT OF MONEY EITHER MORE OR LESS -- INTO ACCOUNT SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED FOR CHILDCARE FUTURE CHILD CARE EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. WE IDENTIFY TO AREAS THAT THE STATE MIGHT WANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO STRATEGICALLY PRIORITIZE FUNDS AND WE CONSIDERED SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT IT WILL BE COMING AVAILABLE -- THE FIRST AREA IS AROUND FACILITY ARRANGEMENTS AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE THE FACILITY ARRANGEMENTS THAT CURRENT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAVE AND WHAT ARE THEIR MAINTENANCE ISSUES WHAT ARE SOME FACILITY LIABILITIES IN THIS RECOMMENDATION IS FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING FACILITY ISSUES OF CURRENT PROVIDERS SO THAT WE ARE. NOT THE STATE IS KNOWLEDGEABLE WHEN DEVELOPING A PROGRAM FOR OF X. OF HIS OF FOR FUTURE FACILITY EXPANSION. ON THE OTHER WAS STUDY THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS SERVING L. -- ELIGIBLE FAMILIES AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF THESE FAMILIES I'M IN THE STUDY IS THERE'S A STRATEGICALLY DEFINE A DESIGN AND INCREASED CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL EXT. THINK ABOUT HOW CARING SPREE PRESCHOOL EXPANSION IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT. HAPPENING ADDITIONAL STUDIES IN GETTING THE INFORMATION TO INCLUDED IN A IN A STATE PROGRAM WOULD TAKE TIME I'M SO THAT THE DECISIONS OF THE STUDIES -- COULD IN COULD INFORM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUDGET -- THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS WELL BEFORE WE GO TO THE CD JUST TO THROW A COUPLE THINGS THAT MAYBE YOU COULD COVER IN YOUR PRESENTATION. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IN AND MAYBE YOU'VE COVERED IT AND I JUST. MY OLD BRAIN IS SLOW I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT INFORMATION WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT. YOU KNOW CHILD CARE AND PRE SCHOOL FACILITIES AND WORK FORCE. NUMBER. ONE A NUMBER TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE THE NEW. STUDY. COURSE TO TO STUDIES I GUESS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED. WILL. INTERFACE WITH STUDIES THAT APPARENTLY IN COMMISSION REPORTS OF CURRENTLY FORTY BEEN CONDUCTED IN RELEASED OR IN THE PROCESS WHETHER IT'S THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION OR THIS OTHER WORKGROUP ON RATE STRUCTURES OR THE WORKFORCE STUDY THAT APPARENTLY IS. GOING TO BE RELEASED IN LATE. TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE CUSTOM DOING A LOT OF STUDIES UP HERE AND SEEING A LOT OF STUDY PROPOSALS AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER ONE BUT HOW DO HOW DO WE GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS AND FIGURE OUT. WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE NEED WHAT WE'VE SEENTHREE OTHER TIMES IN DIFFERENT VERSIONS AND OR WE SIMPLY FOR FUNDING? ANOTHER STUDY THAT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION FOR WHICH I APOLOGIZE BUT I WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT. CITY BEFORE YOU PRESENTED AND MAYBE YOU COULD HELP COVER THAT. I AN SPEAK TO THE GOVERNOR'S ON STRATEGIC MASTER PLAN AND AND WHAT THE INTENTION IS AND HOW IT'S GOING. TO A PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION AND AND COVERED. SOME OF THE DATA COLLECTION THAT THAT WE'RE SHORT REALLY STRUGGLING TO GET SO -- THIS MASTER PLAN IS IS INTENDED TO BUILD OFF ALL OF THESE OTHER GREAT PLANS WE KNOW THAT CD HAS THEIR PRESCHOOL -- DEVELOPMENT GRANT -- A NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT THEY'RE DOING AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION THE THE WORK GROUP ON ON RACE THERE BEEN. SO MANY GREAT PLANS HAVE BEEN OUT THERE AND THIS PARTICULAR MASTER PLAN IS VERY IS. PLANNING ON BUILDING ON TOP OF ALL OF THOSE -- THOSE PLANS PROVIDE A LOT OF GREAT POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THIS MASTER PLAN ONCE THE LINK THOSE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO STRATEGIES AND ONE OF THE REALLY. BIG EMPHASES THAT ODD THIS PLAN IS GOING TO ADDRESS IS ALSO LOOKING OUT FUNDING SOURCES SO IDENTIFYING -- THE FUNDING SOURCES THAT WOULD REALLY MAKE THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS REALLY GETTING INTO THE WEEDS ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IT WOULD TAKE FINANCIALLY. TO TO CREATE THE PROGRAMS AND AND THE THE ACCESS. THAT FAMILIES NEED -- WITHIN THESE THESE LARGER CHILD CARE SYSTEM I I GET IT. I UNDERSTAND. GOOD POINTS YES MA'AM. YES MARY. ALWAYS OKAYFEMINIST I REWORKED FOR US AS WE DIVE INTO THE WORK FORCE ISSUE WE KNOW FROM THE RESEARCH -- ACTUALLY MINUTE BACK UP AND JUST AT THE HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE STARK ACT -- INVESTMENT IN ACCESS THAT THESE ARE BEING PAIRED WITH MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM OVER ALSO WORK FOR SOME FACILITIES OR THINGS WE HEAR ABOUT DALY. pTHE STATE THAT THEY REALLY NEED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AND SO STARTING WITH THE WORK FORCE WE KNOW THAT RESEARCH REALLY SHOWS THE QUALITY AND RESPONSIVENESS OF CHILD ADULT INTERACTIONS. IN THE EARLY LEARNING CARE ENVIRONMENTS -- MAJOR PREDICTOR OF CHILD OUTCOMES FOCUSING ON THOSE ADULTS THOSE ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE CARE IS THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF ANY EXPANSION. WITH THAT WE WILL ALWAYS THERE BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THEIR ACTUAL PROFESSIONAL LEARNING THE HIGHER EDUCATION PORTFOLIO THAT THEY MAY NEED WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON COMPENSATION. AND ENSURING THAT THE WORK FORCES ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED RESEARCH TELLS US THAT 58% OF CHILD CARE WORKER FAMILIES PARTICIPATE IN ONE OR MORE PUBLIC INCOME SUPPORT PROGRAMS. CITIES TEACHERS THEMSELVES MAKE A FRACTION OF WHAT KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS MAKE AND DON'T HAVE THE DIGITAL RESOURCES TO PAY FOR THE COURSE WORKER TRAINING. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING QUALITY BY INCREASING THE KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES OF THE WORK FORCE. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT IT IS PARA AND RECOGNIZE THAT THEY WILL NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE COURSE WORK AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AS WE DIVE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF LESSNS LEARNED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS FROM QUALITY PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED. THROUGH BOTH RC CDF OUR CHILDCARE AND DEVELOPMENT FUND QUALITY PROJECTS WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED AB TWO TWELVE THERE'S ALSO BEEN SENDING THAT FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA FUNDED IN THE PAST CALLED FIRST FIVE CARES. THROUGH THOSE WORKFORCE EFFORTS AS WELL AS OUR CURRENT QUALITY COUNTS CALIFORNIA QUALITY READING IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM WE HAVE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE THINK WE ON THE TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO I WAS STRESSED OVER AND OVER THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING INTENTIONAL ENSURING THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE WORK FORCE YOU REALLY NEED TO WRAP AROUND. THE EDUCATIONAL PROFESSIONAL LEARNING GOALS THAT THEY SAT TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THEM. ONE KEY THING WE FOUND WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF ADVISORS A FORMER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WAS UNIQUE IN THAT REQUIRED PARTICIPANTS TO MEET WITH AN ADVISOR TWICE A YEAR. WHO COULD HELP MAP OUT THEIR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING JOURNEY ADVISE THEM WHAT TRAININGS AND COURSE WORKS THAT THEY COULD TAKE TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE THAT? FROM THE RESEARCH ON EVALUATION OF THAT PROGRAM THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT THE PARTICIPANTS THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE WAS EIGHT THEY FELT VALIDATED AND THEIR PROFESSION. MEETING WITH THAT ADVISER MADE THEM FEEL HEARD AND IMPORTANT IN THEIR WORK. SECOND WITH COURSE WORK THAT DEVELOPS KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES SO MUCH OF PROGRAM QUALITY ACTUALLY DEALS WITH PERFECTING THAT CHILD ADULT INTERACTION. THE WINNING COURSE WORK THAT INCLUDES STRONG PRACTICE BASED COMPONENTS THAT'S BEST FOUND TO PROMOTE CHANGES AND PRACTICE. AND PERMITS KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES VERSUS JUST THEORY OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT. AT ENSURING THAT WE HAVE LINKS COURSES ONE OF THE TOP BARRIERS FOR EARLY EDUCATORS AND GETTING THEIR CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. MOVING ON TO GET AN AIRING OR A BA IS ACTUALLY OBTAINING THE GENERAL ED REQUIREMENTS THOSE MATH AND ENGLISH COURSES. THEY REALLY SEEM TO BE A STICKING POINT FOR THEM IF YOU CAN LINK OF COURSE BETWEEN MATH AND ENGLISH WITH SOMETHING WITH CHILD DEVELOPMENT WE FOUND THAT IS A STRATEGY THAT HELP THEM. BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THROUGH THOSE G. COURSES WE ALSO FOUND A POWER OF COHORTS. OR APPRENTICESHIP MODELS THAT WHEN YOU BAD IN BED A COHORT TOGETHER THAT GOES THROUGH THE DEGREE AS A TEAM THEY HAVE THE SUPPORTS THEY GET TRAINING. A CAT AM TUTORING THAT THAT REALLY HELP THEM BE MORE SUCCESSFUL AND RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE STATE THERE SOME APPRENTICESHIP MODELS FOR THEY'VE ACTUALLY EMBEDDED THAT INTO. THE PROGRAM ITSELF AS A WAY TO GROW YOUR OWN STAFF AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND JOB TRAINING. FELT REALLY. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ALL OF THIS WE THINK THERE ARE SOME OTHER KEEP THINGS AS WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HOLD COURSES IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. DURING NONTRADITIONAL TIMES AND TO BE HELD AND COMMUNITY LOCATIONS SUCH AS RESOURCES AND REFERRALS VERSUS ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS ALL THE TIME. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR TEACHERS REALLY UNDERSTAND INCLUSIVE PRACTICE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS AS WE GROW CAN SUPPORT CHILDREN ACROSS ALL OF THE AND ABILITY LEVELS. INCLUDING THOSE CHILDREN THAT HAVE AN I. F. S. P. R. AND I. E. P.. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN REALLY SUPPORT DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND SUPPORT HOME LANGUAGE AS WELL AS ENGLISH. ADDRESS SOME OF THE ANTI BY A SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE ISSUES. THAT COME UP IN IN OUR PROGRAMS AND REALLY LOOK AT WHO CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN ARE AND SUPPORT THAT WHOLE CHILD. AS WE LOOK TOWARDS EXPANSION WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO EDUCATE OUR WORKFORCE NOW IN ALL OF THESE AREAS. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THOSE ADDITIONAL THIRTY THOUSAND THOUGHTS WE ALSO KNOW THAT FUNDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS A SMART INVESTMENT AND WILL REALLY HELP SUPPORT THE PROGRAM QUALITY. AS WE LOOK AT BUILDING SOME OF THAT OUT WE DO KNOW WE NEED SOME OF THE DATA SYSTEMS TO CAPTURE THAT THERE IS A WORK FOR STUDY THAT HIDEOUS HELP FINE ALONG WITH FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA. THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME OF THE DATA ON IT THEY REALLY ENSURING THAT WE CAN CAPTURE ONGOING INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AS WELL AS PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PROGRAMS SUPPORTING PROVIDERS AND WORKING WITH INSTITUTES OF HIGHER ADD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR COURSE WORK IS ACTUALLY APPLICABLE TO WHAT WE NEED ON THE GROUND AS PROVIDERS IN THE FIELD. THE MOVING ON FROM NOT FISCAL EXPANSION WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S WISE INVESTMENT ENSURING THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FACILITIES AVAILABLE. SINCE FACILITIES AND AVAILABILITY OF CARE ARE INTERTWINED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE CAPACITY ISSUE WE HAVE IS THE STATE THIS DEALS MORE WTH A LICENSE CARE BUT IT REALLY IS THE LICENSE FACILITIES THAT ARE PART OF THE ISSUE. CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT SIX POINT FIVE MILLION CHILDREN AGE BIRTH THROUGH AGE TWELVE AND NOT AS SORT OF OUR SCOPE OF ARE SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING CARE FIELD. OF THESE CHILDREN WE ESTIMATE ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION PARENTS NEED CARE. OF THE CHILDREN NEEDING CARE ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SUBSIDIZED CARE. BUT AS YOU LOOK AT LICENSED CAPACITY WE ONLY HAVE LICENSE CAPACITY TO CARE FOR UNDER A MILLION CHILDREN AT ANY ONE TIME. SO TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CARE FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN NEED CARE AND WE ONLY ACTUALLY HAVE LICENSE THOUGHTS. FOR UNDER AND MILLION FROM. THE JUST THINKING OF THAT AND KNOWING THAT IT'S NOT JUST FACILITIES BUT FACILITIES IS DEFINITELY ONE AT THAT. AND THEY WERE REALLY HAPPY I AM ANGRY FOR THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AND PULL TOGETHER MORE AT THIS ISSUE. THERE'S ALSO THINGS AROUND CHILD CARE DESERT'S AND WE THINK PAIRING THE WORK FORCE AS WELL AS THE FACILITIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHILD CARE DESERT AREAS. WILL BE N IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. WE ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THERE ARE SOME. SOME CONCERNS IN DIFFERENT AREAS AROUND FACILITIES THAT WE WILL NEED TO NAVIGATE A LITTLE BIT MORE DEEPLY. AROUND ENSURING THAT THEY AREN'T A GIFT ABOUT THE PUBLIC FUNDS AND THAT WE ENSURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS AND IS FACILITIES CONTINUE TO BENEFIT SUBSIDIZE CHILDREN. FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS AFTER AN AWARD IS GIVEN. THE REALLY EXPLORING IDEAS AROUND WORKING WITH AN INTERMEDIARY ORGANIZATION WHO CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THROUGH AS YOU WORK ACROSS THE STATE MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF OUR PROVIDERS AND PROGRAMS CAN ACCESS THAT VERSUS JUST THE RELEASE THAT THE ONES WHO HAVE MORE EXPERTISE AND FACILITIES. SO AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILD THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD OUR SYSTEM AN INCREASE ACCESS FOR CHILDREN FAMILIES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS -- WITH RESPECT TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT YOU KNOW AND IN A DIFFERENT SETTING IN THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. DIFFERENT TIME HAVE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ON CTP -- COORDINATION IN THE STATE. COORDINATING THE FINE WORK THAT OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS DO WITH. WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE -- A DISCONNECT ON THE DEMAND SIDE HERE WE'RE TALKING IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A DEMAND SIDE ISSUE. OF FINDING IN TRAINING -- WORKERS TO WORK IN THE CHILD CARE SETTING IN THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND EDUCATION SETTING. EARLY EDUCATION SETTING. HOW DO HOW TO OUR EFFORTS HERE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT COORDINATOR INTERFACE WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE C. T.? IN THE C. T. E. AREA WITH OUR REGIONAL CONSORTIA -- ARE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THE ON LINE COLLEGE IS BEING DEVELOPED AND AND WHAT THE THE FINE WORK THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ARE DOING. IN A SIMILAR FASHION. THAT A FAIR QUESTION. A TRENTON ACOSTA. A LIFE OF RECOVERY CALLS IS AS WELL -- SO -- I THINK THAT THAT THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS A PRETTY DECENTRALIZED -- SYSTEM AND SO IT BEING DONE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY FOR US FROM ACROSS THE STATE -- UNFORTUNATELY THE CENTRAL. AND ALSO EVEN EVEN IN THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES WE HAVE THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM WHICH DOES REQUIRE COLLEGES. TO SERVE GET GET TOGETHER IN CONSORTIA AND AND DEVELOP THEM PLANS AROUND SOME OF THESE -- IMPORT INDUSTRIES. THAT I THINK THE HOW MUCH ANY SPECIFIC REGION IS GOING TO PRIORITIZE EARLY EDUCATION WRIST VERSUS OTHERS. IT IS IS GONNA VERY ACROSS THE STATE I WOULD SAY IT IN A MOVE BY THE WAY THEY SHOULD PRIORITIZE IT BASED ON THE DEMAND IN THE REGION. WHICH IS THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE EQUATION WHICH IS WHAT CONCERNED YEAH AND I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK THE THE STRONG WORK FORCE FROM OUR WE HAVE HAD ACT A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD SOME CONVERSATION WITH COMMITTEE CALLED STE -- FOLKS ABOUT THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OF INTO THE COLLEGES ARE PRIORITIZING PROGRAMS THAT DO ONE OF TWO THINGS ONE IS THERE'S DEMAND FOR THIS INCREASED NUMBER OF JOBS. IN TO THAT WE CAN EXPECT THAT THOSE -- INDIVIDUALS WHO. WHO'D CONDUCT THE TRAINING TO GET THOSE JOBS ARE WELL PAID. I THINK SOME COMEY COLLEGES ON THE DEMAND SIDE OF ITS FOR EXPANDING PRESCHOOL THEN THERE MIGHT BE -- THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL JOBS BUT COMPARED TO OTHER POTENTIAL CD TYPE PROGRAMS -- BEING IN THE EARLY EDUCATION WORKFORCE RIGHT NOW IS NOT VIEWED AS A VERY HIGH PAYING JOB AND SO SOME COLLEGES. ARE PRIORITIZING SOME UP SOME OF THE OTHER INDUSTRIES -- BECAUSE OF THAT. WHICH RESULTS IN A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITY. ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES IN OUR PRIORITY HERE IN THE IN THE LEGISLATURE IF IT IS A PRIORITY. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION DISCONNECT BETWEEN THAT AND WHAT'S GOING TO GOING ON DOWN IN THE REGION'S WITH RESPECT TO EDUCATING AND PREPARING THE WORKFORCE TO MEET. A REQUIREMENTS WHICH PROBABLY PROBABLY NEED TO WORK ON THAT. COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS. SEVERAL OF THANK YOU. FIRST A COMMENT -- I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AT THAT THESE I I WILL SAY WOMEN BECAUSE I HAVEN'T MADE ANY MEN CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. THESE WOMEN ARE I'M SURE THERE'S SOME SURE THEY'RE WONDERFUL BUT IT'S PRIMARILY WOMEN. AND THESE WOMEN ARE SO PROUD SPECIALLY THE IN HOME DAY CARE CENTERS A LICENSED ONCE SO PROUD OF THE JOB THAT THEY DO AND THEY REALLY DO DO A REMARKABLE JOB I'M IMPRESSED EVERY TIME I VISIT ONE OF THE SITES. AND I THINK THE MORE WE CAN DO FOR THEM OFFERING ADDITIONAL CLASSES AND COURSES. THEY JUST WANT TO DO THEIR BEST FOR THESE KIDS THEY YOU KNOW THEY STILL LOVE THEM AND TO YOUR POINT RICHARD. AND TO YOUR POINT WE ARE OFFERING IT BECAUSE THE THE CLASSES BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T PAY WELL YOU DON'T BECOME A CHILD CARE PROVIDER BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY OR BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE RICH YOU DO BECAUSE YOU LOVE CHILDREN AND YOU BELIEVE IN -- ADVANCING OUR FUTURE SO THERE IS A DISCONNECT THERE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON ONE IN MASON JOB THESE WOMEN DO AND AND HOW PROUD THEY ARE OF WITH THE SERVICE THEY ARE PROVIDING FOR WORKING FAMILIES IN. THESE CHILDREN AND THEN I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE CHILD CARE DESERTS DO YOU WHERE ARE THOSE I HAD NOT HEARD THAT BEFORE. I'M SURE IT'S QUITE TRUE BUT I JUST HADN'T HEARD THAT. WE ARE ACTUALLY ANALYZING OUR DATA RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A NUMBER I THINK ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND STATE CODES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY LICENSED KAREN NONE. AND YET THE FAMILIES ARE SEEKING STEPS TODAY HAVE SUBSIDIES ARE ACCESS TO ROGERS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CARE. THERE'S QUITE A NUMBER WE TEND TO SEE IT MORE IN RURAL ISOLATED COMMUNITIES. AM SO IF YOU LOOK IN LINDA NOT NORTH ATTENDS TO HAPPEN A LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DIVE INTO MORE AND MORE HAPPY TO SHARE AS WE SERVE EXPLORE THE DATA. THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU. ZERO YEAH -- I TO THIS WORKFORCE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE. EXPANDING SLOTS WITH BIG PLANS TO MOVE AHEAD IN THE FUTURE. AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE. FILL IN THOSE POSITIONS ARE YOU KNOW WHO I THIS TEACHERS. AND SO I GUESS THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT -- ABOUT YOU KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH WERE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WITH THEM IN A LOT OF COMMITTEE COLLEGES THAT ARE OUT THERE ACTUALLY HAVE EXCELLENT PROGRAMS -- YOU KNOW KIND OF MAKES YOU WONDER YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF OF B. A.'S I UNDERSTAND THERE'S LIKE A SENSE THAT HAVING A BA PROVIDES FOR HIGHER QUALITY. TRAINING -- AND AND TEACHING THOUGH AS YOU SAY IF SOME OF THE CURRICULUM SO FAR AWAY FROM THE CORE. SKILLS THAT THEY NEED FOR THE ACTUAL WORK. IT MAKES YOU WHERE WONDER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE RIGHT I MEAN IT YOU KNOW IS IS. IS IT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING EXTRA SPECIAL ABOUT THIS TWO X. TWO YEARS IN COLLEGE THAT THEY CAN'T PICK UP INTO EXTRA YEARS ON THE JOB -- AS  AS A AS A EARLY CHILDHOOD AND INSTRUCTOR YOU KNOW I I KNOW WE'RE ALL GOING TO VERY WRAPPED UP IN THE IMPORTANCE OF A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BUT I WONDER ON PARTICULAR GIPSON HAS YOU SAY THE GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS ARE KIND OF LITTLE OFF. FROM THE FROM THE FROM THAT THE NEEDS OF THE TEACHERS. I WONDER HOW WHETHER WE'RE WE'RE LETTING -- FORM TROUBLED TRUMP FUNCTION. SO I WOULD SAY ACTUALLY WAS SPEAKING SPEAKING ACROSS THE SPECTRUM FELLOW AS WE HAVE PROVIDERS COMMAND EVEN FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR PROVIDERS HAVE BANNED IN SOME OF OUR TRAINING AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS IN THE PAST BECAUSE IF. YOU SHARED THAT THEY WANT TO DO THAT BASS THEY WANT TO BE THE BEST THAT THEY CAN BE TO SUPPORT THESE CHILDREN TO BE SUCCESSFUL. PHIL WE'VE SEEN THAT -- NOT JUST AT THE BE A LEVEL BUT THE A LEVEL TWO YOU BUMP INTO THOSE REQUIREMENTS AROUND GENERAL AD AND THE PROVIDERS TEND TO STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH. THE ENGLISH AND ESPECIALLY THE MATH COURSES THROUGH ITS ACROSS ALL OF THEM AND SOME OF THE ACCESS POINTS IF YOU'RE WORKING ALL DAY AND SOME OF OUR PROVIDERS WORK. INTO THE EVENING IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO ACCESSING SO EVEN IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THAT. IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THOSE A LITTLE BIT MORE AVAILABLE WHETHER THEY BE WEB BASED WHETHER THEY HAVE THEM IN THE WEEKENDS ARE RATHER THEY HAVE EVENING ACCESS TO SOMETHING. BUT THEN HOW DO YOU PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THEM SO THEY DON'T FEEL SORT OF OFF ON THEIR OWN IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER THAT THEY MAY NOT BE SKILLED AT AND SO IT REALLY IS PAIRING THEM TOGETHER WITH AN ADVISER. THOSE CORE HURTS WORKED FABULOUSLY WE DID HAVE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND CO HURTS IN THE YEARS PAST WHO DID WANT TO GO AND GET THEIR BACHELORS. AND I MEAN I WOULD NEVER WANT TO SAY TO A WOMAN A WOMAN OF COLOR THAT THEY CAN'T ACHIEVE THAT BACHELOR'S IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. THE WE SAW SUCCESS ACROSS ALL OF IT THE KID CAN CAN AGREE WITH THAT MORE BUT BUT I BUT I GUESS WHAT I WHAT I'M THINKING -- WITH THE THE AMBITIOUS A PRO PRO REALLY AMBITIOUS PLANS TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM -- WE'RE GONNA NEED -- TO THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF OF HIRING NEEDS I AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNISTIC WE'VE GOT GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- TO TRAIN THEM IS REALLY GREAT PROGRAMS OUT THERE UP AND DOWN THE STATE IT JUST MAKES YOU WONDER WHETHER WE OUGHT. TO KIND OF BUILD ON THAT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD CERTIFICATES DAY AIDS. OBVIOUSLY WITH THAT WITH THE OPTION OF OF FOLKS TO GO ON AND GET HIGHER DEGREES IF IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. I THAT WILL SURELY HELP IS A QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT ON BIG BIG GIVEN THAT. THE THE THE CALIBER THE PROGRAMS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE NEED THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PLACING ON THE SYSTEM VERY VERY SOON AND QUITE FRANKLY THE REALLY EXCITING JOB OPPORTUNITIES ARE OUT THERE FOR YOUNG PERSON. WHO WANTS TO GO INTO THIS KIND OF WORK? ON YOUR MAKES ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW TO COORDINATE AND EXPAND THE EXISTING COMMUNICATIVE FOR STRUCTURE. TO REALLY HAVE YOU KNOW. TO TO TO BE ABLE TO TO TO TO DEAL WITH IN A IN A IN A VERY POSITIVE PROACTIVE. MEETING FOR WAY THE DEMAND IT WILL BE OUT THERE AND AND I JUST THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW CERTIFICATES A IS WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO. TO TO TO JUST GET -- GET MORE STUDENTS A GOOD QUALITY TRAINING THAT THEY NEED NOW. TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE DEMAND OF THE STATE WILL BE PUSHING OUT THERE. AND I I LOVE THE I DON'T KNOW IS THERE IS THERE BEEN A CONVERSATION WITH THE TO ME COLLEGES ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS AND HOW TO GET FUNDING TO THEM FOR THIS AND HOW TO REALLY. BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I WORRY I'M I'M WORKING RIGHT NOW ON A COORDINATING A COUPLE COURTING BILLS RIGHT YOU KNOW. SO AS WE WE DO GREAT STUFF IN ONE PORTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND THAT AND THAT CREATES A WHOLE NEW SET OF OPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ON OTHER PARTY EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OUT WE MAKE SURE THAT THE LEFT IN STOCK IN THE RIGHT HAND. I THINK IT JUST FROM PAST EXPERIENCE WITH OUR PROGRAMS THEY TYPICALLY HAVE PARTNERED VERY CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT'S CREAM THAT ACCESS POINT SAID THAT. THE PROVIDERS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO GO ON TO THE COLLEGE CAMPUS TO ACCESS THE COURSES AND THAT'S WHY SOME OF THE PRODUCES PROGRAMS HAVE BROUGHT THEM ON TO THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM CENTER SITE. AND THEY BROUGHT IN FAMILY TUCKER PROVIDERS FROM THE COMMUNITY DO COULD BE PAIRED WITH CENTER STAFF AS THEY GO THROUGH ARTICULATED COURSE WORK THAT'S BEING TAUGHT THROUGH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR ANOTHER COLLEGE SYSTEM. THROUGH ITS JUST INSURING AS YOU LOOK AT LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT YOU THOUGHT THROUGH WHO IS THE WORK FORCE HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT ACCESS AND SUPPORTS ARE THERE. SO THEY CAN BE EFFECTIVE AS THEY GO THROUGH THE COURSES AND I DO THINK CONTINUING TO UPDATE WHAT THOSE COURSES REFLECT AND ENSURING THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE HERE TODAY. SO THAT WE REALLY HAVE A WORK FORCE WHO KNOWS HOW TO SUPPORT BILINGUALISM AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT A CHILD SOME LANGUAGE IN ANOTHER. AND AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CLASSES THAT I THINK THAT WE'VE SEEN IN PAST WORK FOR STUDIES WARRANT IS AVAILABLE AND SO MAKING MORE AND MORE IF THAT. CONTENT KNOWLEDGE AVAILABLE GERMAN FOREIGN CARE IN THAT PIECE. EMBEDDING DOT AS SOMETHING THAT ALL OF OUR PROVIDERS SCOTT AS THEY MOVE FORWARD. WOULD REALLY SUPPORT OUR CHILDREN. WELL. I'LL MAKE THIS OBSERVATION -- AND I'VE. WE DID A SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING ON SOME OF THIS DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I'VE TALKED TO SOME FOLKS IN AND A GENERALIZATION WE GENERALLY LEAVE IT TO THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY. K. THROUGH TWELVE AND ABOVE. TO BOTH DESIGN PROVIDE THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BUT ALSO TO IDENTIFY [inaudible] THE NEED. ANECDOTALLY IT WORKS IN DIFFERENT WAYS SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT THE CASE BUT GENERALLY WE RELY ON THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY. TO IDENTIFY THE NEED AND THEN BY THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT AND I AM NOT SURE THAT'S THE BEST AND MOST ORGANIZED EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO IT. SO I'M GIVING KUDOS THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR STEPPING OUTSIDE THE SANDBOX AND DOING THINGS THAT I THINK OTHER. ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE ORGANIZED TO DO WHICH IS IDENTIFY WITH THE JOB NEED IS IN THIS CASE CHILD CARE. EDUCATION WORKERS AND THEN WORK WITH THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING -- AND THE CERTIFICATES OF DEGREES WHATEVER THEY ARE WHATEVER LEVEL. TO TO MEET THE NEEDS THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT IN A MORE ORGANIZED. AND EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE WAY STARTING STATE DOWN NOT TO TAKE AWAY LOCAL CONTROL FOR THE LOCAL. REGIONAL CONSORTIA OR WHATEVER THE ORGANIZATIONAL ENTITY IS THAT IS TASKED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY WOULD DETERMINE THE NEED IN THE REGION IN SOME REGIONS MIGHT HAVE A HIGH NEED. FOR OF EDUCATION WORKERS. OTHER REGIONS MAY NOT HAVE QUITE AS MUCH IN THE BUT THIS IS NOT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS AND I'M JUST GIVING A LECTURE RIGHT NOW BUT I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT MY PERSPECTIVE IS AND THE GOOD NEWS IS. WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO FUND A STUDY. YET ANOTHER. ONE TO BUILD ON THE OTHER STUDIES THAT WE'VE HAD WE HAVE AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS STUDY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS STUDY CAN DO IS AT LEAST DETERMINE IN THIS. AREA WHETHER THAT WE CAN HAVE A MORE ORGANIZED APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING THE JOB IN THE THE DEMAND SIDE AND COUPLING THAT WITH THE EDUCATION PIECE TO PROVIDE THE WORK FORCE THAT WE NEED IN THIS AREA TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE WHO BADLY NEED. SERVICE. SO HAVING SAID THAT. OUR SERVICE. MISTER CHAIR THIS IS JUST A COMMENT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEM -- ATTAINING. DEGREES AND WHATNOT AND HOW DO WE DO THAT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT'S ALREADY BEEN NOTED THAT THESE ARE HIGH AYING JOBS. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE THE DISCONNECT IS IS THAT WE LOOK AT CHILD CARE. ABOUT PROVIDERS WHICH ARE PRIMARILY WOMEN THERE IN LOW WAGE MINIMUM WAGE JOBS MOST THE TIME WITH NO PENSION SO YOU MIGHT BE A CHILD CARE PROVIDER FOR THIRTY YEARS. AND WHEN YOU RETIRE. WHAT IS THERE FOR YOU AND OUR HOME CARE WORKERS ARE IN THE SAME BOAT THESE ARE MOSTLY IN THAT THAT'S -- THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDING THAT SERVICE. JUST WANT TO STOP THINK ABOUT. TAKING CARE OF THESE KIDS BUT WHAT WE ALSO DOING FOR THE WOMEN THAT ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR OUR FUTURE AND TO IN RAISING OUR FUTURE. AND IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THEM EXPECT THEM TO WORK AT MINIMUM WAGE AND HAVE NO PENSION. WHAT WHAT DO WE DO AND WE'RE GAVE WE DON'T HEAD ON THE FRONT AND WE'RE GOING TO PAY IT ON THE BACK AND SO I JUST SO THAT OUT FOR US TO ALL CONSIDERING THINK ABOUT? WAS A TRACK MORE PEOPLE YEAH AND THE TRIP ARE PEOPLE WHO. CO EXITING FURTHER. THANK YOU LOU PELOSI GREAT PRESENTATION JOIN THE CONVERSATION LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING ANOTHER. ONE ISSUE NUMBER FOUR IS A WOMEN'S CAUCUS PROPOSAL I'M GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR LEYVA TO MAKE A PRESENTATION. GONNA FIGHTER OKAY I'M READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I FIRST WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT AS THE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS -- THERE BEEN MANY WOMEN WHO HAVE COME BEFORE ME AND BEEN THE CHAIR AND REALLY REALLY GREAT WORK I JUST. I'M THE LUCKY ONE WHO GETS TO BE THE STEWARD OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND TRY TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD. THIS YEAR -- WE ARE WORKING ON AGAIN ON SLOTS IN CHILD CARE AS WE DO EVERY YEAR AND FOR OVER A DECADE THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS PRIORITIZE INCREASING ACCESS. TO SUBSIDIZE CHILD CARE FOR CARE FOR OUR YOUNGEST UNDERSERVED CHILDREN INCALIFORNIA. IT HAS BEEN A DEATH A DECADE. OF THE AS SEEN DRASTIC LONG LASTING CUTS TO A SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED AND IN SERIOUS NEED OF SUPPORT. THROUGH THE WORK OF OUR PREVIOUS% WOMEN'S CAUCUS CHAIR'S WE'VE ALSO SEEN INCREMENTAL POSITIVE STEPS. THIS YEAR IS NO DIFFERENT THE CAUCUS REMAINS COMMITTED TO MAKING THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS AND EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR YOUNGEST UNDERSERVED CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS BEEN VOCAL AND PUTTING THE NEEDS OF OUR YOUNGEST AT THE TOP OF THEIR AGENDA. THE TIME IS NOW TO MAKE A REAL INVESTMENT IN CHILD CARE. AND I MUST SAY THAT FOR THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO CAME RIGHT OUT AND SAID THAT HE IS WORRIED ABOUT THE YOUNGEST AMONG US. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY MAKE LASTING CHANGE THE NEED FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES HAS ALWAYS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY. HOWEVER NEWER DEBTOR SHIP DATA SHOWS THAT INVESTMENT NOW IS MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN JUST ONE IN NINE CHILDREN ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY RECEIVE SERVICES. IN ORDER TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE THE CAUCUS ULTIMATELY BELIEVES THAT WE MUST INVEST IN THE WORK FORCE WHICH IN TURN WILL GIVE PROVIDERS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE MORE CHILDREN AS WE JUST DISCUSSED. SPECIFICALLY. CALIFORNIA HAS A BIFURCATED SYSTEM OF REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR EARLY LEARNING SERVICES WHICH COMPLICATES EFFORTS TO FUND AND DELIVER HIGH QUALITY EAZY E. PROGRAMS. THAT MEET THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN. THE GOAL HERE IS TO CREATE A SINGLE REGIONALI STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE THAT DOES FOR THINGS ONE COMPENSATES TEACHERS AND PROGRAMS FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE. TO IS RESPONSIVE TO THE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THREE RECOGNIZES THE COST OF MEETING VARYING QUALITY STANDARDS FOR INCENTIVIZE IS QUALITY AND PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH BASED EQUALITY IN BOOK AND PROVE ME EFFORTS.% WE SHOULD ALSO DEVELOP GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS TO FACILITATE EASY E. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE EASY WORKFORCE AGAIN WE JUST SPOKE ABOUT THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE CONSISTENCY IN HOW THESE FUNDS ARE APPLIED WE SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES DO NOT EXPERIENCE A BREAK IN CHILD CARE SERVICES. DUE TO BE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE THREE STAGES OF CHILD CARE BY STREAMLINING CAL WORKS STAGEONE CHILD CARE ELIGIBILITY RULES. CONTINUITY OF CARE CREATES THE STABLE CONDITIONS THAT CHILDREN NEED FOR HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS BELIEVES THAT WHILE BOOSTING FUNDING FOR CHILD CARE% FACILITIES LIKE THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED IS IMPORTANT.

WELL INCREMENTAL INVESTMENTS IN SLOTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS MOST HAVE BEEN TARGETED TOWARDS THE CALIFORNIA ST PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. WELL IS IMPORTANT INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE STATE WITH THE FIRST CHILD CARE NEEDS WE WAS PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS NEEDED FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE PULP POPULATIONS. LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES WHICH OFTEN WORK NONTRADITIONAL HOURS ARE ALREADY STE AND ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO FOR THE BASICS. WELL ONE PROGRAM CAN HELP ONE FAMILY IT MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR THE NEXT FAMILY. IMPROVING THE WORK FORCE INCREASING SLOTS WILL HELP CALIFORNIA BEGIN TO MEET ITS GOAL.

ONE TIME. ONE TIME AND THE ONE BILLION WOULD BE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS CEREMONY QUESTIONS [inaudible] EASY [inaudible] SUPER PRESENTATIONS. ISSUE NUMBER SIX KINDERGARTEN CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT. PAGE TWENTY ON THE AGENDA GOOD AFTERNOON IF YOU WOULD IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD STORE IN MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT SIR Q.. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DAVID O'BRIEN A DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT A COMMISSION THANK YOU AFTER RUN GOOD. TO SEE YOU GEN MERRY ARE WITH FINANCE. THE KING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IF YOU. AGREE TO BROUGHT THE LEGISLATIVE OFF THE MR ROW THANK YOU. OKAY WHO WANTS TO START. ASSAULTING OFF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT PILOT PROJECTS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AGENCIES AND PHILANTHROPY IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO TRIAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR INCOMING KINDERGARTNERS. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO BUILD ASSETS FOR THE CHILDREN'S POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. ADDITIONALLY THE CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS PROGRAM IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS PROMOTE EQUITY IN THE STATE BY PROMOTING FINANCIAL LITERACY. CULTIVATING A COLLEGE GOING IDENTITY AMONG BOTH STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND LEVERAGING RESOURCES FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES TO ASSIST IN MAKING POST SECONDARY EDUCATION ATTAINABLE. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] HELLO. THANK YOU FOR THINKING THAT THE L. L.. TO FIND OVER VEAL AND COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AS CONTEXT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND FURTHER DISCUSSION. THE SERGEANTS HAVE JUST DISTRIBUTED A HANDOUT THAT'LL BE SPEAKING FROM. ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE INTRODUCE THE TYPE OF SAVINGS ACCOUNT CALLED THE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. THIS IS CREATED BY FEDERAL LAW IN THE MID NINETIES AND IS THE BASIS OF MANY TOP SAVINGS ACCOUNT INITIAL. IN SHORT A PARENT OR OTHER ADULT CAN OPEN UP AT FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN ON BEHALF OF THE CHILD. AND INVEST FUNDS NOT PLAN WHICH WILL TYPICALLY GROW OVER TIME. MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN OF FOR THE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IS THAT THE EARNINGS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT TAXABLE AS LONG FOR SKIN USES THE FUNDS AND QUALIFYING EDUCATION EXPENSES. IN THIS CASE IS EXPENSES INCLUDING TUITION FEES BOOKS SUPPLIES AND ALSO SET LIVING EXPENSES. NEARLY EVERY STATE ADMINISTERS A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN AND CALIFORNIA ARE JUST CALLED SCHOLAR SHARE. ADMINISTERED BY AN OFFICE WITHIN THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER THREE ENGINE TEN THOUSAND OPEN ACCOUNT. FOR PERIODICALLY SCHOLARS ARE OFFERS INCENTIVES FOR FAMILIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. CURRENTLY THROUGH THE END OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN CALENDAR YEAR LOWER INCOME FAMILIES CAN RECEIVE MATCHING A SENTENCE OF UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS THEY OPEN A NEW ACCOUNT. AND ESTABLISH AUTOMATIC ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS. PETER HAND OUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL LOCAL EFFORTS TO EXPAND PARTICIPATION IN COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS STARTED IN SAN FRANCISCO IN. TWENTY ELEVEN CURRENTLY THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AUTOMATICALLY OPENS A COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT ON BEHALF OF EVERY KINDERGARTEN AND THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT. MAKES INITIAL DEPOSIT NOT ACCOUNT AND THEN OFFERS ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO CONTRIBUTE. SINCE THE CREATION OF THAT PROGRAM IN SAN FRANCISCO VARIOUS OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND ALSO. WENT TO BE INCLUDING BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE LUNCH SIMILAR INITIATIVES. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE INITIATIVES DO VERY IN TERMS OF WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THEM. WHAT THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE INCLUDING WHETHER IT OFTEN OR OPT OUT? AND WHAT MATCHING CENTERS ARE AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES. RECENTLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE STATE TO CREATE A PROGRAM CALLED EVERY KID COUNTS THAT'S INTENDED TO SUPPORT THESE LOCAL INITIATIVES. THIS PROGRAM IS MINISTERED BY THE STATE NEED COMMISSION. AND IN SHORT IT PROVIDES GRANTS TO LOCAL ENTITIES THAT HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE SOARING DEVELOPMENT TO INCENTIVIZE LOWER INCOME FAMILIES TO SAVE FOR COLLEGE. RECOGNIZING THAT THE STUDENT A QUESTION WILL BE PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON THIS PROGRAM ALL I'LL KEEP OUR COMMENTS BRIEF AND JUST NOTE THAT LAST MONTH THE COMMISSION DID APPROVE NINE GRANTEES FOR THIS PROGRAM TOTALING TWO POINT NINE MILLION. THAT CONCLUDES OUR OVERVIEW OF COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. COMMISSIONS NEXT. I I HOPE YOU'LL COME AND YOU RECEIVED NINE APPLICATIONS AND APPROVED ONLINE I'M SORT OF SURPRISE YOU ONLY RECEIVE NINE SO MAYBE YOU COULD GO INTO THAT FOR ME DURING YOUR PRESENTATION. YES SIR CERTAINLY ARE DAVID A BRAND OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION SO -- AS THE ONLY A MENTION AS YOUR YOUR EXCELLENT STAFF AGENDA SUMMARIZES THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT ESTABLISHED THE EVERY KID COUNTS COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAM. PROVIDED SOME ONE TIME FUNDING AND WAS LATER AMENDED TO PUT THIS PROGRAM UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STUDENT A COMMISSION -- BUT WE CAME UP WITH A AN ELIGIBILITY FORMULA BASED ON THE WORDING OF THE STATUTE WHERE BY -- ENTITIES ITS SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS WOULD RECEIVE A PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE TWO POINT NINE MILLION AVAILABLE FUNDS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF HOW MANY STUDENTS THEY INTENDED TO SERVE. AND SPECIFICALLY HOW MANY LOW INCOME FAMILIES THEY INTENDED TO SERVE BECAUSE THE INTENT OF THE STATUE WAS TO ENCOURAGE SAVINGS -- AND TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR SAVINGS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. WE DID RECEIVE APPLICATIONS FROM A TOTAL OF NINE ENTITIES WE DID SOME LIMITED OUT REACH WE DIDN'T HAVE A DEDICATED BUNCH DO IN THE EXTENDED OUT REACH. BUT WE DID SOME LIMITED OUT REACH THROUGH CONTACTS THAT WE HAD MADE AND THROUGH ORGANIZATIONS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT PAYS ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WAS AWARE THAT THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE AND SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION. JUST SPECULATING HERE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT -- WE MAY HAVE NOT GOTTEN MORE THAN THE NINE IS THAT THERE WAS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT THE ENTITY EITHER HAVE A PROGRAM IN OPERATION OR IN DEVELOPMENT. AS OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST LAST YEAR SO THIS FUNDING IN THIS PARTICULAR AND BUDGET ACTION ITEM WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE A SEED FUNDING OR START UP FUNDING. FOR LOCAL ENTITIES ACCORDING TO THE WORDING OF A STATUTE IT WAS INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT OR PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS. OR OTHER -- PROGRAM EVALUATION FUNDS FOR ENTITIES THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A PROGRAM SO THAT COULD BE SORT OF SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE DIDN'T GET MORE THAN THE NINE IT MAY BE SOMETHING WORTH CONSIDERING THE FUTURE FOR FUTURE PROGRAMS WHETHER. THAT RESTRICTION SHOULD STILL BE IN THERE OR WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THE FUNDS FROM THE STATE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR SORT OF START UP FUNDS WHICH WAS NOT ALLOWED. UNDER THE EVERY KICK COUNTS AND WHAT WILL I PRESUME YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER DEADLINE OF FEBRUARY. TWENTY TWENTY THIS WAS A ONE TIME PROGRAM -- SO WE DISTRIBUTED THE FUNDS ON A ONE TIME BASIS -- WE RECEIVED NINE APPLICATIONS SCORED THEM DID THE PROPORTIONAL FUNDING AND THEN AT OUR MARCH COMMISSION MEETING OUR COMMISSIONERS -- APPROVED THE STOCK RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUNDING BUT WE SELL NEW PROGRAM. WAS THE FIFTY MILLION FR CORRECTS -- I'VE DONE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE PROGRAM IS SAYS LATER TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSION I BELIEVE -- SO TO CLARIFY -- AS MISTER O'BRIEN SAID THE THREE MILLION THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY GETS COUNTS ACT WAS APPROPRIATED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR A ONE TIME PURPOSE. THE CURRENT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A WORKING TEAM TO HAVE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND WE HOPE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS FORTHCOMING ON HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE EXPANDED AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH WHICH ORGANIZATIONS OR AND WHAT FRAMEWORK WILL BE USED AND WELL I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE. THAT I MEAN IF IF IT'S GOING TO BE IF THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE MUNICIPALITIES HAVING PROGRAMS OR OR COUNTIES YOUR PROBABLY MISS BELL IS WOULD BE THE BEST -- GOVERNMENT ENTITY I GUESS. THEN I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT USE. THE SERVICES OF THE LEGAL CALIFORNIA CITIES AND SOME OF THESE OTHER -- ASSOCIATIONS TO GET THE WORD OUT I'M. I'M SORT OF DISAPPOINTED THAT -- I DON'T SEE ANY CENTRAL VALLEY -- INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- CITIES ON THE LIST -- OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T HAVE PROGRAMS BY DECEMBER THIRTY ONE OF WHATEVER THE YEAR WAS BUT IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE -- HISTORICALLY HAD LOW. OF HIGH SCHOOL COMPLETION GRADUATION RATES -- LOW COLLEGE GOING RATE FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING DOWN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WHERE I COME FROM IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I HOPE THEY STEP IT UP A NOTCH AND SEE IF WE CAN PUT PROGRAMS TOGETHER -- TO QUALIFY FOR SOME OF THIS MONEY. AND I I THINK I WOULD JUST KNOW THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I THINK AS WE DELIBERATE ON THE PROPOSALS AND THE EXACT FORM IT'S GONNA TAKE IS THIS ISSUE OF STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING FUNDS TO JUMPSTART PROGRAMS MAYBE IN AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T EXIST. BUT BALANCING THAT AGAINST WHETHER THAT'S SUSTAINABLE OR NOT OR IF THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF LOCAL MATCH. I'M NOT AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THIS BE USED TO JUMP START PROGRAMS I'M SUGGESTING THAT. PEOPLE IN AREAS WHERE WE'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY FOR YEARS TO DRIVE UP HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES AND COLLEGE GOING RATES. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CREATE THEIR OWN PROGRAM SO THAT THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN A GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IN THE BUDGET AND YOU'RE GONNA BE. NICE ENOUGH TO ADMINISTER -- WE NEED TO GET THE WORD OUT WRITE VANCE OF YOU KNOW EARLIER THAN THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE DEADLINE HER HER AND SET THE SET THE PROGRAM START DATE -- AT A AT A POINT WHERE PEOPLE CAN. GET RAMPED UP SO THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM. IT QUESTIONS KELLY. THE HOOD I CUT OUT APPEARED EVERYBODY GET ENOUGH CONTINUES SPEAK. THEIR OWN ANYTHING. EXCELLENT. BUT FOR TO HAVE A CONTINUE DISCUSSION THIS EXCELLENT PROGRAM THANKS TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR DOING THIS. OKAY OUR FINAL AGENDA ITEM BEFORE PUBLIC COMMENT IS ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN SPECIAL EDUCATION OKAY YOU KNOW THE DRILL FOR I COULD ASK YOU TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD TO MY LEFT YOU RIGHT MA'AM. I AS HEATHER CARLSON -- WITH THE SPECIAL EDUCATION DIVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION TWENTY THURMAN. THANK YOU WAS GROSSING SAID ATTORNEY. YES MA'AM LISA RESIDENTS HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU YEAH. MICHELLE ILLEGAL ALSO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BRIAN ANDERSON ALEJO. MISTER ANDERSON GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK. OKAY WHO WANTS TO START. A STATUS I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT OF WHICH ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION AS ONE TIME FOR EXPANDED SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SCHOOL READINESS SUPPORT FOR KNOWN AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANT. THIS FUNDING IS TARGETED AT A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES WITH BOTH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AS WELL AS HIGHWAYS SEVEN DUPLICATED PEOPLE SO THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE -- ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AND YOUTH FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THE THESE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT SERVICES FOR STUDENTS ALREADY RECEIVING SUPPORTS BEYOND WHAT IS AN IP AS WELL AS TO FIND PREVENTIVE SERVICES SUCH AS EARLY INTERVENTION IN PRESCHOOL. THESE FUNDS CAN ALSO BE USED TO ADOPT STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IDENTIFIED TO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT -- AS WELL AS TO BUILD OR EXPAND UPON LOCAL MULTI TIER SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS OUR MTS -- AND I'LL JUST CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS BY A AT BY SAYING THAT THIS IS A HISTORIC INVESTMENT SPECIAL EDUCATION. BUT IS ALSO A STRATEGIC ONE WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY -- THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS GOVERNOR IS REALLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE COMPOUNDING EFFECTS OF POVERTY RATE POVERTY IMPACTS EVERY ASPECT OF A PERSON'S LIFE OF THE CHILD. FIVE AND THAT'S NO DIFFERENT FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES -- AND SO THIS FUNDING IS REALLY TO HAVE TARGETED INCREASE INVESTMENTS TO MORE REALISTICALLY SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ESPECIALLY STUDENTS IN HIGH NEED AREAS -- AND TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THESE A STUDENTS AND BONTA BOOK COMMUNITIES AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS [inaudible] HELLO. YEAH -- SO THE ADMINISTRATION JUST LAID OUT THERE PROPOSAL AND I WILL GET TO THAT AND OUR COMMENTS ON IT BUT FIRST I WAS ASKED TO OFFER SOME. HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF CURRENT ISSUES IN SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE AND I'LL BE DOING SO. IN THE HANDOUT THAT THE SERGEANT JUST DISTRIBUTED. THE FIRST PAGE OF THAT HAND OUT AS JUST A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE CONCEPT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION SO. REAL QUICKLY SPECIAL EDUCATION INSTRUCTION DESIGNED TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF EACH CHILD WITH A DISABILITY FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT ALL SCHOOL ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IDENTIFIED ALL CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES THAT AFFECT THEIR LEARNING AND ALONG WITH THEIR PARENTS DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM SPELLING OUT THE SPECIFIC SERVICES EACH OF THOSE CHILDREN WILL RECEIVE. THE FIRST PAGE OF OUR HAND OUT WE LAY OUT THE MOST COMMON DISABILITIES BY GRAY THE OLD NOTICE FIRST OF ALL. ABOUT 60% OF ALL CHILDREN WHO ARE IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. OF ONE OF TWO I USUALLY MILD. DISABILITIES. IN THE EARLIER GRADES THAT'S LARGELY SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS SEARCHES STUTTERING ARE ARTICULATION DISORDERS. AND THE LATER GRADES IT'S COMMONLY LEARNING DISORDERS SUCH AS DYSLEXIA. THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT LAYS OUT SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE. OF THE TWO BASIC IDEAS HERE FIRST. CHILDREN WHO ARE RECEIVING SPECIAL EDUCATION OR GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FIRST THEY RECEIVE. INSTRUCTION THE SAME CURRICULUM. OFTEN FROM THE SAME TEACHERS IN THE SAME CLASSROOMS AS THEIR PEERS WHO DO NOT HAVE DISABILITIES AND THEY GENERATE THE SAME FUNDING LARGELY THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. TO SUPPORT THOSE ACTIVITIES SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS INCURRED ABOVE AND BEYOND THOSE GENERAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES. BECAUSE OF THOSE CHILDREN'S I HE'S. WELL THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO PLAYS OUT THE MOST RECENT DATA WE HAVE WHICH IS FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ON THOSE BECAUSE YOU'LL NOTE THAT. CURRENTLY IT COSTS ABOUT THREE TIMES AS MUCH ON AVERAGE TO EDUCATE A STUDENT WITH DISABILITIES. AS A STERN WHO DOES NOT HAVE DISABILITIES OF COURSE THIS VARIES A LOT BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EACH STUDENT. PAGE THREE TRACKS HOW THESE COSTS HAVE BEEN CHANGING OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. RATE THAT IT PRINTED IN A WAY THAT IT'S IT'S HARD TO SEE EXACTLY WHERE THIS LINE AND SPREAD. IN INFLATION ADJUSTED TERMS TOTAL SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES HAVE INCREASED BY A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THIS PERIOD. THAT INCREASES BEEN BORN LARGELY BY THE LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE SHARES SO. THE THAT WOULD BE THE SHARE OF THESE ACCESS SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY STATE AND FEDERAL CATEGORICAL FUNDS. AND NOW THIS SHARE THE LOCAL SHARE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSES INCREASE FROM. WILL LESSEN 50% IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT TWO WILL MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE ARE NUMBER OF REASONS WHY COSTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING BUT AMONG THE LARGER OURS SPILLOVER EFFECTS FROM GENERAL EDUCATION COSTS. AS TEACHERS RECEIVE NEGOTIATED SALARY AND OTHER COMPENSATION INCREASES THESE APPLY TO SPECIAL EDUCATORS WHILE. ALSO AS PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATES HAVE INCREASED OF THOSE HAVE FACTORED SPECIAL EDUCATION BECAUSE WE THINK THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE INCREASE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES OVER THE LAST DECADE. OF THE REST WE BELIEVE IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION IN PARTICULAR AT THAT INCREASES BEING DRIVEN BY TWO POPULATIONS. OF FIRST THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED WITH AUTISM HAS BEEN INCREASING RATHER NOTABLY OVER THIS PERIOD. AND SECOND THE POPULATION OF CHILDREN IDENTIFIED WITH DISABILITIES AGES THREE AND FOUR HAS IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THIS PERIOD. AND THE FOURTH PAGE OF THIS HANDOUT SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY TO THAT POPULATION. SO FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO BEGIN IDENTIFYING AND SERVING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AT AGE. THREE THESE CHILDREN CAN BE SERVED AND ONE OF THREE GENERAL SETTINGS EITHER -- THE MAINSTREAM PRESCHOOL SETTING SUCH AS YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER STATE PRESCHOOL OR THE FEDERAL HEAD START PROGRAM. LATEST DATA SUGGEST THAT A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ARE SERVED IN SUCH PROGRAMS. ABOUT A THIRD OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ARE SERVED AND SPECIAL PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT ONLY SERVE OTHERS SOON OUR OTHER CHILDREN WITH DISABILITES. AND OF THE REMAINDER. ABOUT A QUARTER. I'D AREN'T RECEIVING ANY COMPREHENSIVE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM BUT ARE JUST RECEIVING SOME. CIVIC ADD ON SERVICES SUCH AS SPEECH THERAPY. L. AS NOTED EARLIER WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN RECEIVING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS SERVED ABOUT. FIFTY THOUSAND OF THESE CHILDREN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF ABOUT 25% FROM A DECADE PRIOR. AND ACCORDINGLY COSTS OF ALSO GONE UP -- SO IN THE LATEST DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS REPORTED SPENDING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. ON THESE SERVICES AND THAT'S UP FROM ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. A DECADE PRIOR. WELL THE LAST THING TO NOTE HERE IS THAT THESE COSTS ARE COVERED. UP. ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY THE LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE SHARE. OF SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDE SOME CATEGORICAL FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS POPULATION AND COVERS ABOUT 20% OF THE ASSOCIATED COSTS BUT THE STATE CURRENTLY PROVIDES NO SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR THIS THAT STATE CATEGORICAL FUNDING. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION IS. SPECIFICALLY FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION. THE FIFTH PAGE RAISES A COUPLE OTHER ISSUES WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING THAT WE COMMONLY HEAR ABOUT. ONE IS THAT. OUR PRIMARY ALLOCATION FORMULA FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION CATEGORICAL DOLLARS IS BASED ON ACCOUNT OF TOTAL STUDENT ATTENDANCE -- IN EACH STUDENT WHO SHOWS UP REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE DISABILITIES AND NOT GENERATES A FUNDING RATE. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT THOSE RATES VARY QUITE NOTABLY ACROSS THE STATE. FROM LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SOME REGIONS TO MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND OTHER REGIONS. THAT THERE'S NO. REAL POLICY RATIONALE FOR THIS INEQUITY THIS IS A RESULT OF VARIOUS HISTORICAL FACTORS WHICH HAVE BEEN GRANDFATHERED AND AND IT'S SOMETHING BUT PARTICULARLY THE REGION'S RECEIVING THE LOWER RATES. OFTEN A COME TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK FOR CORRECTION. THE OTHER ISSUE WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT IS THAT. THIS PRACTICE OF GIVING FUNDING BASED ON OVERALL STUDENT ATTENDANCE BY DESIGN DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR ANY. REGIONAL VARIATIONS AND COSTS SO WE DO HAVE THESE INEQUITIES THE INEQUITIES AREN'T SAY LINK TO THE INCIDENCE OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE THE SERVICES THAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE BEING PROVIDED. WE DO KNOW THAT BOTH THE INCIDENCE AND THE COST OF SERVING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES FAIRIES NOTABLY AROUND THE STATE FROM -- SOME REGIONS IDENTIFY FEWER THAN 10% OF THEIR STUDENTS AS HAVING DISABILITIES OTHERS NEARLY 20%. THE ASSOCIATED COSTS RANGE FROM LESS THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT IN SOME REGIONS STONE MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN OTHER REGIONS. THE STATE'S CRRENT FUNDING FORMULA DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR SUCH VARIATIONS NOW THE PREVIOUS US STAND FUNDING FORMULAS DID AND THEY WERE SCRAPS AND IN PART BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT. A GROWING ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY IN SOME CASES THERE IS CONCERNS THAT THEY WERE. CREATING AN APPROPRIATE FISCAL INCENTIVES BUT THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE AT THAT TIME I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. THAT THE FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT COVERS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FOR SEED MINISTRATION JUST DESCRIBED WERE. OF WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL AND WE HAVE A COUPLE SPECIFIC CONCERNS FIRST. OF WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL'S LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S STATED GOALS OF WHILE THEY INDICATE THAT. THE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO BE SPENT ON ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING OR EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT DAY FOR STUDENTS FROM REQUIRING SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS NOT CONTROLLING UGH IN FACT THE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE WE BELIEVE BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS THE STATE THAT. MANY OF THEM ARE CALLING OUT FOR ADDITIONAL CATEGORICAL FUNDING JUST TO COVER THEIR EXISTING SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS AND WILL LIKELY INTERPRET -- THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANTS IT'S JUST THAT AND PUT THAT TOWARDS. COVERING THEIR EXISTING PROGRAMS -- WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS BETTER OPTIONS FOR AUGMENTING STATE CATEGORICAL FUNDING IF INDEED THAT'S WHAT WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE USED. FOR ROSS OF CONCERN SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED. THEY WOULD LIKE TO INVEST IN EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THAT. REDUCE THE IDENTIFICATION RATE FOR SINCE -- IN SPECIAL EDUCATION -- BUT WE THINK THAT THE FISCAL INCENTIVES CREATED BY THEIR PROPOSAL ACTUALLY WORK COUNTER THAT. IN FACT -- FOR EVERY STUDENT THAT ARE A DISTRICT THAT WAS RECEIVING A SPECIAL EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANT. THAT NO LONGER IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION THAT DISTRICT WOULD BE OUT ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ON GOING FUNDING. WE THINK THAT SENDS A STRONG FISCAL INCENTIVES THAT ACTUALLY PUSHES IN THE OTHER DIRECTION THAT YOU SHOULD IDENTIFY MORE CHILDREN NOT. FEWER. AS MENTIONED BEFORE WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS OTHER OPTIONS FOR AUGMENTING FUNDING AND WE DO OUTLINED A COUPLE. ON THE AS OF LAST BULLET. HI THERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD EQUALIZE PERCENT FUNDING RATES OR COULD DEDICATE SOME STATE CATEGORICAL FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES -- EITHER THESE PROPOSALS COULD BE STRUCTURED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS AND HOW YOU STRUCTURE IT. WOULD ULTIMATELY -- DETERMINE HOW MUCH IT COSTS BUT WE THINK EITHER APPROACH COULD BE ADOPTED WITHIN THE AMOUNT THAT SET ASIDE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THAT'S IT FOR MY REMARKS SO WITH RESPECT TO EQUALIZATION ON PAGE FIVE YOUR YOUR FIRST BULLET -- WITH THE WITH THE RATES VARYING FROM FOREIGN EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS TO NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER STUDENT. EQUALIZATION WITH EQUAL EQUALIZE THOSE PER STUDENT RATES. THE U. S. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS THE A. B. E. YOU COULD DO IT AT THE OF BUTTON THE GENERAL CONCEPT IS THAT YOU SAID SOME TARGET -- SAY THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE. BAD 90% OF OF FOLKS CURRENTLY ARE RECEIVING EITHER THAT RATE OR A LOWER RATE AND THEN YOU LIFT EVERYONE WHO'S AT A LOWER RATE UP TO THAT AMOUNT. WE ESTIMATE THAT COST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD STILL LEAVE SOME INEQUITIES RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE THAT TOP TEN PERCENTILE WOULD STILL BE RECEIVING -- THEIR HISTORICAL FUNDING LEVELS BUT IF YOU WERE TO FULLY EQUALIZE WOULD COST SUBSTANTIALLY MORE. AND THE COST OF THE PROVIDING DEDICATED STATE FUNDING FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. A IT WOULD DEPEND AGAIN ON HOW YOU STRUCTURE THAT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER PROPOSALS OUT THERE BUT YOU COULD -- EASILY STRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT COST SOMEWHERE AROUND THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SAYS SIMILAR TO THE GOVERNOR'S ON GOING PROPOSAL. WELL OR POORLY OF SOME SCHOOLS IN SOMERS STATER IDENTIFYING FEWER THAN 10% OF THEIR STUDENTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. THOSE SCHOOLS MUST BE RECEIVED BUT THE BUT THE BUT THE FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED ON A PER STUDENT BASIS THOSE SCHOOLS. MUST BE RECEIVING A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO EDUCATE THE SPECIAL NEEDS. COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH. YEAH WE FIND THE A IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THIS DIVISION INTO THE THREE POTS OF FUNDING RIGHT THE LOCAL THE LOCAL SHARE THE FEDERAL SHARE THIS STATE SURE THAT WE CALLED OUT. IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THAT -- ACROSS ALL THE VARIOUS REGIONS IN THE STATE AT THE EXTREME LEVEL YOU DO FIND THAT SOME HAVE -- NEARLY 90% OF THEIR COSTS COVERED BY STATE CATEGORICAL FUNDING THAT'S CLEARLY NOT THE STORY FOR MOST OF THE STATE BUT IN SOME PLACES THAT IS THE CASE. AND IF WE CHANGE THE SYSTEM TO PROVIDING FUNDING BASED ON STUDENTS WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS. POST TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS ACROSS THE BOARD -- WITH THAT DRIVE UP THE IDENTIFICATION RATE FOR SPECIAL NEEDS. ED. IT'S A SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL POINT AND THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S THAT POLICY IDEA THAT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED FOR MANY YEARS. AND I KNOW IF YOU'D ASKED THIS QUESTION OF SOME ADMINISTRATORS THEY TELL YOU THE ANSWERS NOW THAT. THEY IDENTIFY BASED SOLELY ON WHAT THE APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSIS IS AND THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THAT BUT THE THE LITERATURE DOES SUGGEST THAT THE ANSWER IS YES AND STATES THAT DO PROVIDE. FUNDING BASED ON AN ACCOUNT OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. THOSE STATES HAVE HIGHER IDENTIFICATION RATES THAN STATES THAT HAVE FUNDING SINCE SYSTEM SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA AND I WASN'T IN THE QUESTION SUGGESTING THAT. WITH THE CHANGE PEOPLE WOULD GAME THE SYSTEM I'M JUST WONDERING. WITH THE FUNDING ACROSS THE BOARD FUNDING. SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY I WONDER IF THERE'S THERE'S NO NEED. TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE IDENTIFICATION. IT'S ALSO A GOOD POINT THAT YOU'LL HEAR -- IF YOU TALK TO THE FIELD THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT -- THAT THERE'S DANGER IN GOING TOO FAR IN THE OTHER EXTREME THAT PERHAPS OUR CURRENT FUNDING SYSTEM IS OFFERING A FISCAL DISINCENTIVE TO IDENT TO PROPERLY IDENTIFYING SUBSTANCE THAT SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED WITH AND JUST A COMMON IN A PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD. CLEARLY AND ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THOSE STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. AND THEN WE WOULD CLEARLY AND COMPLETELY PROVIDE ALL OF THE MONEY TO THE DISTRICTS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES WITH THE STUDENTS HER. BY I THANK YOUR DESCRIPTION OF A PERFECT WORLD IS A IS ON POINT BUT I'M INTO GOING ON SEVEN YEARS I'VE LEARNED THAT CERTAINLY IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IS NOT A PERFECT WORLD YEAH. ANYWAY I DIDN'T MEAN SURE CUT ANYBODY ELSE MA'AM. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS. SO THE SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORT AND APPRECIATE ALL THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ENSURING OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE RECEIVING THEIR EDUCATION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACTOR ID EA. AND RECOGNIZING THAT OUR STATE'S HIGHEST NEED YOU OFTEN REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT SERVICES AND PLACEMENTS. INCREASED FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION CONTINUES TO BE AT THE TOP OF MINES IN MANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. AS WE WORK TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND STRIVE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR COMPLEX LEARNERS. WE RECOGNIZE OUR STRENGTHS AND WE CAN THAT THERE'S OME STRINGS AND ALL OF THE THREE PROPOSALS THAT ARE OUT THERE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- THERE'S A SENATE BILL AS TWO SEVENTEEN AS WELL SINCE ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR TWENTY EIGHT ALL OF WHICH ADDRESS SOME IMPORTANT AREA OF NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED SERVICES. WERE SPECIALLY SUPPORTIVE OF ALL OF ANY AND ALL SUPPORTS FOR ELEAZAR TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES TO THE GENERAL EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR PEERS WITHOUT DISABILITIES. AND WE SEE THIS AS INCLUDING THINGS LIKE STATEWIDE TRAINING FOR GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND PARA EDUCATORS AND HOW TO ENSURE UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING OR YOUDE L.. PRINCIPLES -- ARE EMBEDDED IN THEIR TEACHING PRACTICES SO MORE STUDENTS CAN ACCESS THE GENERAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM. WE APPRECIATE THE SENATE ARMED PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EARLY LEARNERS WITH DISABILITIE -- AS YOU HEARD THIS IS A HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING CONCERN IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AS ELEAZAR REQUIRED TO PROVIDE EARLY LEARNING -- EARLY EDUCATION LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND SERVICES BUT VERY LITTLE FUNDING IS PROVIDED TO DO SO. THE SENATE PROPOSAL WOULD ADDRESS THIS LONG STANDING SHORTFALL IN WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO MANY ALLEY ETS. WHO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PRESCHOOL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES HOWEVER IT WOULD NOT BENEFIT ALL ONLY ACE IN THE STATE -- AS WE CONTINUE TO MAP TO EMPLOYMENT FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WE NEED MORE EQUITABLE PRE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING AND OPPORTUNITIES. AND BETTER ARTICULATED AND PERSON CENTER TRANSITION PLANNING ACROSS THE STATE WHICH COULD BE DONE THROUGH SCALING% COORDINATED PROGRAMMING LIKE HELL PROMISE AND WORKABILITY -- WE CURRENTLY CURRENTLY ALL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO PROGRAMS AND FUNDING -- THE SUPERINTENDENT IS THRILLED TO HAVE SPECIAL EDUCATION AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON THE MINDS OF OUR POLICY MAKERS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITHYOU ALL ON THE BEST WAY TO PROVIDE. IT IN THE MOST EQUITABLE AND EFFECTIVE MANNER THAT WILL PRODUCE THE BEST OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND AGAIN AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR TEACHERS BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATORS WHO NEED THE SUPPORT MENTORSHIP AND WORKING CONDITIONS TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. PARTICULARLY THROUGH MORE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING IN UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING AND MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. AND I'M HAPPY TAKEN QUESTION WILL YOU TOUCHED ON THE WORK FORCE ISSUE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THIS OF FOR A SIGNIFICANT SHORTFALL IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION [inaudible] EDUCATOR. WORK FOR SERENA IS MY UNDERSTANDING CORRECT. I DIDN'T. MAYBE I MISSED IT I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING IN ANYBODY'S PROPOSAL INCLUDING. SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE ONES THAT I'VE SEEN THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT. I'M. WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING IN THE CURRENT YEAR HOW ARE IN THE BUDGET THE PROPOSED BUDGET BUT THERE WAS -- A PROPOSAL IN THE CURRENT YEAR. FOR COMING UP WITH A AND A FINANCE COULD PROBABLY SPEAK BETTER THAN I COULD ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT WERE LOOKING AT TRYING TO GET -- MORE WORK FORCE IN I THINK IT WAS STEM AND SPECIAL ED -- AND AND I DON'TI CAN'T SPEAK TO HOW THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE. WILL TRY TO STICK TO THE LINE ITEM THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE BUT I DO THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE. TO TO FOCUS ON GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HOWEVER ADEQUATE ARE INADEQUATE. TO CONTINUING TO MOVE TOWARDS SOLVING THE ISSUE [inaudible] ZERO YEAH I CLOSER FIRST OF ALL IT JUST SEND IN AS A BIT OF A COMMENT. TO AYE. YOUR WIFE QUESTION MISTER. YOU KNOW I REALLY WOULD PUSH BACK ON THE IDEA THAT -- THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS DANGER OF INCENTIVIZING OVER IDENTIFICATION. THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE EVEN IF WE CREATE A SYSTEM. THAT MIGHT DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB OF REFLECTING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL ED. ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. IT WILL STILL BE A FRACTION. OF THE THE REAL COST AND WE THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE EVER GOING TO FIND. THESE PROGRAMS THAT HAD A PERCENT SO EVEN IF WE DID A BET EVEN IF WE MET THAT YOU KNOW A LITTLE SAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO WE CAME UP WITH THE 40% THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH OF THE COST SO SEE WITH IDA. I INSTEAD OF THE ELEVEN OR 12% THAT THEY'RE COMING UP WITH. I THERE WOULD STILL BE -- FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE. AND JUST TO TALK REALLY COLEY ABOUT THIS BUT A FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT. OUR ALLEY A TO TO YOU KNOW TO TO TO HAVE A SPECIAL I CAN'T. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COSTS ASSOCIATED SO IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'VE BEEN IN REALLY TRYING AND WE'VE TALKED A BIT -- AT WITH FOLKS FROM OUT LA -- AND AND THE THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE HAD A HEARING ON THIS AYE AYE AYE PRO I WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY. WAS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HAVE THE SYSTEM BETTER REFLECT THE COST SO. EVEN UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY'RE NEVER GOING -- TO FULLY REIMBURSED THE DISTRICTS. AFTER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED IN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE IS JUST SO MUCH TENSION. ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN OF AYE EP'S -- THERE IS YOU KNOW THE THE DISTRICTS NO -- THE COSTS ASSOCIATED IT CREATES VERY INTENSE NEGOTIATIONS WITH FAMILIES THAT CAN OFTENTIMES I'D TURN INTO. A VERY EXPENSIVE LITIGATION. I EIGHT AND AND IT'S BECOME A REAL TENSION POINT OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM I SAY THIS HAVING SERVED ON THE SCHOOL BOARD IN MY OWN HOMETOWN BUT THEN ALSO SERVING ON THE LA COUNTY SCHOOL TRUSTEES ASSOCIATION. GOT A CHANCE THE TO LEARN HEAR STORIES FROM UP AND DOWN -- THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGION SO. I'M YOU KNOW AT THE THE SAT I I GUESS MY MY POINT IS I I JUST I I YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT COULD TAKE ME A LONG TIME TO EVER BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A ANY KIND OF DANGER OF OVER IDENTIFICATION. GIVEN THE MACRO COSTS AND MICHAEL PRESSURES AT PLAY HERE. AND I I JUST DONE HOPE THAT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE ENDS -- SANIDAD AND AND AND NUMBER OF US CAN YOU WITH LA -- AND AND YEAH AT DEPARTMENTS OCCASION AND AND DO ASSN AND YET WE CAN WE CAN REALLY WORK TOGETHER. TO COME UP WITH A SYSTEM THAT JUST. YOU BETTER ALIGNS INCENTIVES -- REDUCES THE TENSIONS. AND OUT IN A PROPERLY REIMBURSES UNDERSTAND WHENEVER FULLY REIMBURSED BUT BUT BUT DOES A BETTER JOB I SUPPOSE. OF REFLECTING THE REAL COSTS ON THE GROUND -- SO THAT WE CAN BE SERVING OUR SYSTEM BETTER. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SEEK -- AND THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU IF ANYONE ON THE PANEL HAS ANY. KIND OF COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS ON THAT I KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN -- GOOD. ADDRESSING DOES THE COURSE DISCUSSION BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS ON ON THAT. THAT DIFFICULT BOUNCES STRIKE I CERTAINLY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING. OF ALL IDLE TO THAT AT THE FIRST AID. APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING UP ALL THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT AND AND ONE THAT'S OFTEN RAISED BUT I I NEGLECTED TO RAISE MY EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT -- HOW COULD AN INCENTIVE EXIST WHEN THE STATE'S ONLY GIVING THIRTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR THE ASSOCIATED COSTS? I THINK THE ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND -- IN FISCAL INCENTIVES CAN BE VERY TRICKY AND ONE THING THAT MAKES SOME PARTICULARLY TRICKY IN THIS AREA IS THE WIDE VARIANCE AND COSTS. IN SPECIAL EDUCATION ACROSS REGIONS AND ALSO BETWEEN VARIOUS CHILDREN IN SOME CASES -- CHILDREN -- A DENTAL FIGHT FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION HAVE VERY INTENSIVE NEEDS AND REQUIRE COSTS THAT. ARE IN THE SIX DIGITS -- IN SOME CASES CHILDREN IDENTIFIED. HAVE RELATIVELY MILD MEANS AND MAY ONLY MADE A HALF HOUR OF SPEECH THERAPY A WEEK AND A AND IF YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THAT POPULATION OF CHILDREN THAT'S ON THE BUBBLE WHERE. THE MAY BE UNDER ONE FISCAL REGIME THEY'D BE IDENTIFIED. AS HAVING A DISABILITY BUT UNDER ANOTHER IF THEY WOULD NOT THOSE CHILDREN OFTEN WILL BE ON THE LESS EXPENSIVE RAIN RUSH. YEAH KNOW THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S ACTUALLY ALSO PART OF THE STORY YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE OFTENTIMES QUITE. DRAMATIC RICK YOU KNOW. DIFFERENCES OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN BETWEEN AND SEVERITY OF NEEDS AND THEN THERE'S REALTORS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND MUCH LESS WITH OTHERS. ON LET ME I I'D LIKE TO ASK ONE QUESTION RELATED. TO I EARLY CHILDHOOD YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT ISSUE I MEAN IT IT IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE. IT YOU KNOW ALL THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT. IF WE DO A BETTER JOB OF REALLY IDENTIFICATION AND THEY'RE BEING TREATMENT AND AND AND TARGETED. EDUCATION FOR THOSE LITTLE LITTLE ONES -- WHO? ARE HAVE A SPECIAL NEED ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE POTENTIAL TREMENDOUS COST SAVINGS DOWN THE LINE BECAUSE YOU CAN. YOU CAN REALLY GET OUT -- IT SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW THE THE THE IN THE THE CONDITIONS DISABILITIES THAT -- WILL WILL END UP BOTH BEING A SERIES COST PRESSURE BUT ALSO WROTE IT TO THOSE KIDS QUALITY OF LIFE. BOB AND YET IT'S THE ONE AREA WHERE WE SEEM. TO BE THE MOST UNDER FUNDED OUR SO [inaudible] JUST WANTED. IDENTIFY THAT I AND AND AND HIGHLIGHT THAT I WILL SAY I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S AN INTERESTING ISSUE THAT'S OUT THERE ABOUT THE HAND OFF THE TRANSITION FROM. I FROM WHEN CHILDREN. YOU KNOW -- REACHED. RICH THREE YEARS OLD. ARE. YOU THERE REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE A SMOOTH TRANSITION INTO SCHOOL DISTRICT PROGRAMS FOR THREE YEAR OLDS FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS. AND THAT'S AN AREA THAT I JUST THINK IS NOT BEEN GIVEN ENOUGH ATTENTION I'D LOVE. TO CAN HEAR ANY THOUGHTS OR OR OR DISCUSSION MAY BE HAPPENING IN YOUR IN YOUR RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS. ABOUT THAT TRANSITION AND SOME OF THE THE INFRASTRUCTURAL NEEDS THAT WE HAVE AS A STATE IN THAT. AREA -- GANO WE TOTALLY. THINK THAT ALLEY -- DID A REALLY GREAT REPORT BOUT THIS ISSUE RIGHT THE THREE YEAR OLDS -- WHO ARE BEING SERVED BY REGIONAL CENTERS TO HAVE AN I. F. S. P. THERE'S OFTEN -- A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY SENT OVER TO THE ALLEY AND I PROVIDED ALL THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED -- WE ALSO RACES AS CONCERN AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- FINANCES BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH LA L. IN WITH YOUR STAFF ON HAD HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS AREA OF NEED HAD WE MAKE SURE THAT. AT LEAST THREE YEAR OLDS THESE INFANTS ARE NOT FALL INTO THE CRACKS AND ARE GETTING CONNECTED TO THE CORRECT SERVICES -- WHERE THEY DO MAKE THOSE YOU KNOW THEY DO HAVE THIS GREAT OUTCOMES WHEN THEY ARE CONNECTED TO SCHOOLS AND MANY ARE GETTING THOSE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES SO WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING INTO IT? WE HEAR YOUR CONCERNS -- AND WERE MOVING TOWARD SOMETHING IN THE MAIL THE VICE CRIED I'M REALLY EXCITED TO HEAR THAT I I JUST [inaudible] YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S ANY ASSISTANCE WE CAN GIVE AYE AYE HAPPY TO DO IT BUT I BUT I'M I'M FROM I'M I'M THIS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT. BUBBLES UP ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU TALK TO FOLKS ON THE GROUND -- AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN HOW HOW. HOW TO EASE THE TRANSITION AND I THINK WE CAN HELP WE DO A LOT OF GOOD FOR THESE KIDS? AND THEY'RE IN THEIR DISTRICT THE FOOD REALLY ADDRESS IT MORE FUNDAMENTALLY COMPREHENSIVELY. MAYBE YOU MAYBE YOU ADDRESS THIS YOU KNOW TRYING TO BALANCE -- ALTERNATIVES AND WE TALK ABOUT EQUALIZING YOU KNOW FUNDING RATES AND THEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DEDICATED FUNDING FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE SHOULD USE AND? IN TO THE EXTENT WE GET TO MAKE A DECISION IN MAKING THAT DECISION. AND IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION. FOR FOR SOMEBODY THAT KNEW THIS RODEO. I YEAH I THINK IT IS A FAIR QUESTION -- I THINK OUR OFFICES VIEWPOINT IS SOMEWHAT PECULIAR THAT WAS. THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE PRIMARY ISSUE -- WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING THROUGH OPTIONS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCES IS NOT ACTUALLY FUNDING FOR OUR SERVICES PROVIDED TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES BUT IS THE FUNDING THAT'S? AVAILABLE FOR THE REST OF YOUR STUDENT POPULATION THAT'S ABOUT. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE? OF A SHARE OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION. HI WHICH IS TO SAY THOSE DOLLARS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BEING SPENT ON SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT WHICH ABSENT THE NEED FOR THOSE DOLLARS BECAUSE THERE'S INCREASE CATEGORICAL FUNDING. COULD BE SPENT ON ANY OTHER EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT BURDEN IS SHARED AS EQUITABLY ACROSS THE STATE AS POSSIBLE. NOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO OPTIONS THAT THE LA -- HAS LAID OUT OF EQUALIZATION AND PRESCHOOL FUNDING WHAT WE'RE SAYING AREN'T THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO POPULATIONS OF OF RULES WITH CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE BEING DISADVANTAGED BY THE STATE'S CURRENT. US SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING FORMULA FIRST THOSE THAT. FOR HISTORIC REASONS HAVE THESE. OF LOWER PURSUANT FUNDING RATES THEY THESE SCHOOLS WILL TEND TO BE CONTRIBUTING MORE OUT OF THEIR LCF TOWARD SPECIAL EDUCATION AND THUS HAVE FEWER pSIMILARLY SCHOOLS THAT ARE SERVING LARGE POPULATIONS OF THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WITH DISABILITIES ARE SIMILARLY DISADVANTAGE THERE. DIVERTING WORE THEIR DOLLARS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES OF OF WHICH OF THOSE POPULATIONS YOU WOULD LIKE. TO PRIORITIZE GIVEN THE LIMITED FUNDING AVAILABLE THIS YEAR. I THINK THAT'S A TOUGH DECISION THAT'S THAT SAID. A ONE FOR LEGISLATORS BUT I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE CASE TO BE MADE FOR EITHER. OR UNLESS THERE IS A UNLESS THE THE BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO COMBINE THE METHODS AND REDESIGN. THE TRIGGER POINT BASED ON THE IMPACT TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. IN MY MAKING SENSE YES I DO WELL IN THE SITUATION WHERE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS SOME ELLIE ETS OF HAVE OUR OUR HAVE A HIGHER IMPACT BECAUSE OF A HIGHER POPULATION OF THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. AND THEN THERE ARE OTHERS THAT DON'T HAVE THE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS BUT HAVE. ANOTHER POPULAR SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION IT IMPACTS THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT EXCEEDS THE THE MONEY WE OTHERWISE PROVIDE FOR SPECIAL NEEDS EDUCATION. AND SO MAYBE THE TRIGGER POINT NEEDS TO BE. BASED ON THE IMPACT TO THE THE GENERAL FUND. AS OPPOSED TO THE POPULATION OF SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS. SAID -- I DON'T BRAINSTORMING THAT YOU'RE ENGAGING IN I THINK IS VALUABLE AND I I KNOW THAT MADE THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING. FOR INSTANCE WITH CENTER ALLEN'S OFFICE AND WITH THE FOLKS AT THE TABLE. I IN SOME SENSE I I THINK THE EXTREME OF WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT THE IDEAL. SYSTEM FOR FUNDING SPECIAL EDUCATION WOULD BE SOME KIND OF REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM IN SOME STATES LITERALLY TO FUND SPECIAL EDUCATION. ON A REIMBURSEMENT THEY AS SCHOOLS SHOW US YOUR RECEIPTS SAN WILL GIVE YOU A CERTAIN -- CHAIR OF THOSE COSTS THAT OF COURSE INVITES A LOT OF QUESTIONS WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO FULLY. GET INTO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE MOSTLY INVOLVING ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT -- YOU MIGHT GAME THE SYSTEM SIMPLY ON PAPER BY. ASKING. OF WHAT DOES COUNT AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENSES OPPOSED TO GENERAL EDUCATION EXPENSE LET'S BE VERY TRICKY ISSUES TO WORK THROUGH BUT I I THINK IT IS A WORTHWHILE THOUGHT EXERCISE. OR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO IN ORDER TO EQUALIZE THE IMPACT TO THE NINE SPECIAL. ED FUNDED PIECE OF THE GENERAL FUND YOU HAVE TO SORT OF UNDERSTAND WHAT. HELP PEOPLE ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY SO. THIS DISTRICT CAN GET MORE IN THIS DISTRICT CAN. YEAH AND ONE OF THE THINGS IT COMPLICATES ALL THIS IS THAT. I YOU KNOW THERE IS A PEDAGOGICAL AND LEGAL MOVEMENT TOWARD MAINSTREAM RATED AND HAVING EVERYBODY TOGETHER. AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT'S THE BEST THING TO DO FOR HIM IN MOST CASES. THAT REALLY DOES BLUR THE LINES I AND AND AND AND AND ALSO IN ADDITION I'VE YOU DON'T WANT YOU KNOW IF. THEN AGAIN THERE IS A WHOLE SLEW STUDENTS WHO SHOULD BE MAINSTREAM I I AT THAT ARE TYPICALLY HIGHER COST -- BUT THEN YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU CREATE A SYSTEM THAT REFER BACK TO THE REQUEST OF REFLECTS THOSE COST WITHOUT INCENTIVIZING NON MADE YEAH. SEPARATING KIDS OUT INTO. THIS IS HOW WE GET INTO -- HEAD SPINNING CHALLENGES FASCINATING. YEAH ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. I LOTS OF FOR THE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE DAY OF ALL GET WHAT WILL WANT ONE FINAL THING I'M SO SORRY. ON THE EARLY CHILDHOOD THINK OUT WHAT DO WE DO IN ON ON ON VERY EARLY SCREENING I MEAN WHAT IS THAT IS THAT I KNOW. IS THAT PART OF THE CALCULUS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WITH YOUR PROPOSALS AND A AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FOR BETTER EARLY SCREENING -- I THINK IN TERMS OF VERY EARLY SCREENINGS I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AROUND DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AT A YOUNGER AGE IS NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION BUDGET. BELIEVE IT'S MORE ON THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SIDE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE SCREENINGS ARE HAPPENING -- BUT YET THIS THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT HAVE. IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH SCREENING AT EXTRA IF IF I I MADE BECAUSE I I KNOW IT'S NOT -- MY EDUCATION COLLEAGUES PROPOSAL AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT I'M. ACTUALLY ON MY WAY TO TESTIFY ON THIS ISSUE AT SUB THREE SHORTLY -- SIZE SO I CAN DESCRIBE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSING AND THIS BUDGET TO OFFER A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO MEDI CAL PROVIDERS FOR INSURING THAT THE INFANTS AND TODDLERS THAT THEY SEE DURING THEIR WELL CHILD VISITS RECEIVE. A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENER -- RIGHT NOW THAT IS TECHNICALLY REQUIRED OF MEDI CAL PROVIDERS OF WHICH SPOILER ALERT IS ONE OF THE REASONS. WE'RE RECOMMENDING AGAINST THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH BUT THIS WOULD PROVIDE IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIREMENT. AT A FISCAL INCENTIVES TO PROVIDE THOSE SCREENINGS -- GOOD. OKAY GOOD I LOVE TO GET SOME INFORMATION AND IF YOU WOULD MIND SHARING WITH US YEAH ABSOLUTELY HELPING TOUCH. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS A FASCINATING CONVERSATION I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE OF IT AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE BUDGET. HAVE A GREAT DAY. WELL THAT CONCLUDES THE NORMAL AGENDA AND I THINK IT'S NOW TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. I WOULD -- I KNEW THIS WOULD BE POPULAR. ALL OF THE SO LET'S FORM UP. AND BEFORE WE START.

I'M I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE THE NEED AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM HAS -- AND AND THIS IS THE SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS FAMILIES AND A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SYSTEM IN THE BUDGET ESSENTIALLY THERE'S NO FUNDING. YET THIS IS THE THIS IS THE FLEXIBLE PART OF THE SYSTEM -- WHAT I'D LIKE TO RECOMMEND FOR THE COMMITTEE TO THINK ABOUT? WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT -- ALLOCATING SPACES. WHERE THERE'S NO FACILITIES TO SERVE THE KIDS? LET'S TALK ABOUT MAXIMIZING IF IT'S THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THE SPACES IN THE FUNDING FOR PRESCHOOL CAMPY USE. THAN WOMEN WITHIN NINETY DAYS PUT IT OUT TO THE A PIECE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU NOT ONE DOLLAR WILL GO BACK AND ANOTHER WORKING FAMILY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO CHILDCARE. I ALSO WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE MENTIONED ABOUT VARIABLE WORK SCHEDULES AND PROVIDERS AND WORKFORCE WE WERE WE ROLL IT ALL INTO. ONE WE HAVE TO START WITH THE WORKFORCE AT VALUING THE WORKFORCE WE CURRENTLY HAVE. A LAW THAT SAYS THAT. A A FAMILY IN NEED WILL SECURE A PROVIDER. AND YET WE ONLY PAY THE PROVIDER. EVEN THOUGH THE THE PROVIDERS HOLDING THE SPACE FOR THE FAMILY. WE WILL ONLY PAY THE PROVIDER BASED ON THE ACTUAL USAGE OF THE FAMILY. WELL WE PAY. FOR JANUARY WILL BE PAYING FOR DECEMBER HOURS. IN DECEMBER IF THE FAILY GET SICK OF A FAMILY SOME VERY WILL WORK SCHEDULING WASN'T SURE OF THEIR WORK SCHEDULE AND DIDN'T SHOW UP. THAT PROVIDERS NOT EVEN GONNA KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT AGAIN GOING TO GET FULL PAYMENT UNTIL JANUARY. THAT HURTS US KEEPING PROVIDERS THAT THEY CAN'T COUNT ON HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE.

HOWEVER WE STAND WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE EASY COMMUNITY WHO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE CAN AND SHOULD DO MORE FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WHO NEED SERVICES NOW. PARTICULARLY IN OUR INFANT AND TODDLER SYSTEM WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE OUGHT TO REFORM AND RIGHT SIZE A REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM IN WAYS THAT ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF REGIONAL COST. AND ALLOWS FOR APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION OF THE WORK FORCE. FINALLY EARLY AGE BELIEVES THAT THE STATE MAKES THE SIGNIFICANT THAT AS THE STATE MAKES THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE OUR SIGHTS ON QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. THIS INCLUDES IMPROVING THE STANDARDS IN SETTINGS IN WHICH WE NURTURE OUR CHILDREN AS WELL AS IMPROVING WORK FORCE QUALITY BY PROMOTING RIGOROUS QUALIFICATIONS SUPPORTED BY FAIR COMPENSATION AND MEANINGFUL AND ONGOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER -- I WANNA LINE MY COMMENTS WITH -- WITH PARENT VOICES THIS MORNING AND THE STRUGGLES THAT THE PARENTS PRESENTED -- HOW DIFFICULT IT IS RAISING A FAMILY WHEN YOU'RE LOW INCOME AND I WANT TO SUPPORT THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS FOR MORE SLOTS BECAUSE THESE FAMILIES NEED MORE SUPPORT? THANK YOU. A AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE BARELY JUNIOR I AM SEIU MEMBER. AND I'M A TEACHING ASSISTANT SPECIAL EDUCATION AT LUTHER BURBANK HIGH SCHOOL. AND I HAVE TWO POINTS I'D LIKE TO GO OVER SO I WILL BE DOUBLY QUICK AND NOT MISS MY WORDS -- FIRST OFF -- I REQUEST THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONIES BE ALLOCATED FOR A ONE TIME PURPOSE OF TEACHING -- SPECIAL EDUCATION AIDS IN DISTRICT ON HOW TO DEAL WITH ISSUES SUCH AS BATHROOM BEING -- HAD A BETTER WORK WITH OUR STUDENTS. IN CLOSE QUARTERS WITH THEM. AND HOW TO DEAL WITH CERTAIN SITUATIONS -- WHAT WHETHER IT BE -- THERE LIKE A MOTIONAL DISTRESS PHYSICAL DISTRESS HOW TO HOW TO MANAGE THAT. BECAUSE THERE'S TIMES WHERE THERE IS ONE AID ONE CERTIFIED EIGHT IN A CLASSROOM. AND THE TEACHER WILL TAKE OFF TO GO USE THE RESTROOM AND THE OTHER CLASSIFIED AID WILL TAKE OFF TO GO TAKE A BREAK AND THERE'S ONLY ONE OF US. THAT'S IN THAT ROOM BY OURSELVES WITH A CLASS FULL GENERAL IT'S STUDENTS. AND SOMETIMES ONE OF OUR KIDS IT'S IMMOBILE IN A WHEELCHAIR. UNABLE TO SPEAK WE HAVE. TO FIELD THAT AT THE SAME TIME IS DEALING WITH THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM. MY OTHER POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT -- ME BEING A PROFESSIONAL AID AND THE TERM IS NOT EXACTLY YOU KNOW KOSHER AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW SPECIAL EDUCATION AID MORE LIKE IT -- WE LOVE OUR JOBS WE PUT OUR HEART AND SOUL INTO OUR JOBS. IT IN THAT LIGHT IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK THAT WE HAVE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE THE MONEY'S. AS FAR AS THE OUR PAY TO BE ABLE TO DO OUR JOB. AS BEST AS WE CAN. WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT. TO YOU KNOW LIVING HALF OUT OF OUR VEHICLES -- HAVING YOU KNOW. HEY DO BILL SHOW UP EVERY TIME WE GO HOME. THAT SORT OF THING. IT. I'M NOT ASKING FOR THE ENTIRE BANK JUST A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR ALL THE OTHER IS AN ADJUSTER BECAUSE I MEAN. WE'RE SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE KIDS WE WORK WITH EVERY DAY SOMETIMES WE FALL AROUND THE CAMPUS. ALL DAY LONG. AND YOU KNOW WHETHER YOUR TEACHERAND AID A PRINCIPAL OR VICE PRINCIPAL. STORY IN YOU KNOW THE THE PLANT MANAGER EVERYBODY IS HAS A HAND IN EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN. BECAUSE IN IF IT'S NOT FOR THE KIDS THAN WHAT WE IN A FOR THANK YOU. THE GERMAN SENATORS TEMPERATURES REPRESENTING CHILD THREE SIXTY BASED IN LOS ANGELES. WANT TO SPEAK TO THE FIRST FOUR ITEMS. VIRTUAL THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR ACTING ON HIS BELIEVE SYSTEM EARLY EDUCATON IS CRITICAL. SECOND WE WANT TO ENDORSE THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR ONGOING SUPPORT AS A PRIORITY IN THEIR IN THEIR LIVES LED DELIBERATIONS AND THIRDLY WE WANNA DORSEY C. COALITION. LAST COMMENT IS. LA ALWAYS RECOMMENDED. DELAYING. THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION BECAUSE WE NEED MORE WORK AND SO ON WE'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS WORK. AND AFFECT THE CHILDREN. WE ENDORSE. THE COMMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT. THE THIRD ONE DON'T DELAY IT IN. TWO FOCUS ON SOME FOLKS THAT CAN HELP COUNCIL ADVISE AND NAVIGATE THESE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AS THEY GET THEIR CERTIFICATES. IS EITHER A IS AS YOU GET THERE BE A AND THAT WILL MOVE YOU ALONG THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME JUST -- REMIND YOU TO LOOK AROUND. I'VE GOT A THREE PM MARCHED UP SO. IF THOSE AT THE BACK DON'T GET QUITE AS MUCH TIME BLAME THE ONES AT THE FRONT SO. HAS STICK AROUND TO THE BLAME SIR YOU'RE NEXT YES VERY VERY CLEAR SENATOR OUT THANK YOU CENTER ROSS CENTER ALLEN JEFF BARKER REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. LIMITING MY REMARKS TO THE ISSUE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. ARE YOU HAVE CORRESPONDENCE WITH FROM US -- JOINED BY A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WHICH OUTLINES OUR CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WE ARE. APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE THAT THE GOAL SHOULD BE TO FOCUS ON BETTER OUTCOMES. OUR CONCERNS ARE REALLY BASED IN THE FACT THAT WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION. THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST INEQUITABLE THAT WE LIVE WITH. AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE CONCENTRATION GRANT APPROACH WILL JUST EXACERBATE THOSE INEQUITIES. AND TO JUST GIVE YOU ONE SALIENT EXAMPLE SENATOR ROTH. OF AN IMPACT ON A DISTRICT IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. ARE WE TALKED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ABOUT HOW FOR UNIFIED IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND FISCAL DISTRESS. THEY HAVE BEEN -- DEALING WITH -- GENERAL INCREASING GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COSTS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION WHICH OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS HAVE TOTALED ALMOST A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO IT DOES BECOME A REAL PRESSURE ON THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN THOSE SITUATIONS SO WE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR EQUALIZATION TO BE A PIECE. OF ANY SOLUTION AND THEN LASTLY WE ALSO THAT IS LONG GONE A PRIORITY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THE FOCUS ON EARLY INCLUSION PROGRAMS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD BE A FRUITFUL INVESTMENT AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. YES MA'AM GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE MCANDREW IT ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION BUT THERE ARE DOLLARS ON THE TABLE FOR SPECIAL AT FUNDING WE HAVE FOR YEARS ADVOCATED FOR MORE SPECIALIZED RESOURCES AND SELL. FOR VERY HOPEFUL THAT AT THE END OF THIS CONVERSATION WE HAVE A SPECIAL ED FUNDING SYSTEM THAT IS MORE EQUITABLE BUT IT IS TODAY. I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE OUR KEY ARE WE ARE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF A PROPOSAL THAT IS NOW TWO YEARS IN THE MAKING AB -- FOR TWENTY EIGHT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE SENATE CONSIDER THE STRUCTURE OF EQUALIZATION -- WE'RE SUGGESTING UP TO THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE -- YOU HEARD FROM THE LA -- TODAY THAT SOME DISTRICTS HAVE QUITE A BIT OF THEIR OF THEIR RESOURCES GOVERNOR THERE COSTS COVERED ON AVERAGE THE STATE COVERS 25% OF THE COST OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. THAT MEANS A FULL 66% ON AVERAGE IS COVERED BY THE GENERAL FUND BY LCF DOLLARS SO WE KNOW THAT EVERY DOLLAR THAT THAT GOES IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION. WILL BENEFIT EVERY STUDENT BOTH THE GENERAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND THOSE SPECIAL ED PROGRAMS WE ALSO WOULD PROPOSE PRESCHOOL FUNDING WE KNOW THAT IS SUCH A SMART INVESTMENT. HAVE PRESCHOOL FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS DISTRICTS ARE DOING IT NOW THAT'S AGAIN A SIGNIFICANT COSTS FOR THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW IT'S A SIGNIFICANT NEED. WE ALSO HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ABOUT THE HIGH COST DISABILITIES ESPECIALLY AUTISM YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT TODAY ON THE SENATE FLOOR AS RECOGNIZING AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS NEED THERE TOO AND SO WE WOULD SUGGEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THOSE STUDENTS WITH THE MOST HIGH COST DISABILITIES. HOPEFULLY YOU RECEIVED A COUPLE DOZEN MAYBE EVEN A HUNDRED LETTERS SUPPORTING THIS APPROACH -- I AM JUST BRING ONE HERE FROM THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE ON THE STATE WIDE TASK FORCE THAT WAS -- CONVENED A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- THEY SUPPORT -- OUR PROPOSAL -- AND I'M BRINGING YOU THE LETTER FROM THEIR PUBLIC SECOND DIRECTORS -- THAT WILL HOPEFULLY AND FROM THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM [inaudible] NEXT. EIGHT MY NAME IS ROBIN MUCH LATER AND I WORK HERE IN SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I WORKED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AS AN INSTRUCTIONAL AIDE FOR TWELVE YEARS -- AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF LOCAL SEIU LOCAL -- TEN TO ONE I SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SPECIAL EDUCATION BUDGET AND I'M ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR WORKER TRAINING IN ORDER TO KEEP THIS WORK IN HOUSE. GIVEN OUR CURRENT BUDGET CRISIS IN SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- IT WOULD BE BEST PRACTICE TO TRAIN INSTRUCTIONAL AIDES BETTER AND TO STOP FUNDING FOR PROFIT BASED PROVIDERS WHICH IS OUTSOURCING. ALSO TO SPEAK -- TO THE THREE YEAR OLDS AND THOSE GETTING LOST IN THE CRACKS IF I CAN -- I KNOW OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY STARTS THEM AT THREE WHERE ONE OF THE FEW SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DO THAT WHICH AGAIN IS A REASON WHY WE NEED BETTER TRAINING FOR INSTRUCTIONAL AIDES BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE SETTING THOSE. THREE YEARS ALL OF THREE YEAR OLDS UP FOR SUCCESS TO GO INTO THE CAN DIFFERENT GRAMS WE OFTENTIMES KEEP CONTINUITY OF CARE -- ALSO TO SPEAK TO THAT WITH US DOING ALL OF HOSE THINGS. I WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY THAT THERE'S FUNDING BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS TO NINE OH EIGHT IF I HAVE THE NUMBERS CORRECT WHEN I SAW. THAT THE SPECIAL ED -- FORCE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WAS SPEAKING TO WE GET ON THE LOWER SIDE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT PROPORTIONATELY DIVVY OUT. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE START YOUNGER AND HOW WE KEEP THAT CONTINUITY OF CARE AND EXACTLY ALL THE STUDENTS THAT WE HELP WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND OUR NUMBER IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE WHY ARE WE ONLY GETTING FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE REVISITED. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I APPRECIATE YOU. SENATE ROTH CENTER ALLEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR SINCERE INTEREST IN THE TOPICS TODAY IT'S VERY CLEAR. I'LL BE BRIEF I WANT TO BUILD UPON THE COMMENTS OF MISTER ANDERSON FROM THE LA ELAM'S PROVOCA FROM RIVERSIDE.

ARE GROSSLY INEQUITABLE YOU DISTRIBUTED IN THE STATE. IT'S THE ONE PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN REALLY ADDRESS AND FAX. WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS GREAT IDEAS THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR GREAT IDEAS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT UNTIL WE CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD OR EVERY DISTRICT CAN ACCESS ANY NEW RESOURCES.

THE HISTORY LESSONS OF THE MATH LESSONS THEY'RE THE ONES THAT KNOW THE ROUTINE FOR THE DAY -- WE NEED THOSE SKILLS THAT. THE TEACHERS OF LEARNED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO THE SCHOOLS. I CAME FROM A DIFFERENT QUESTION TIGHTLY. WHEN I CAME AND I STARTED AS A SUB FOR THE DISTRICT? AND THEN I BECAME PERMANENT -- BUT THAT MEANS THAT I DON'T HAVE THE SAME EDUCATION THAT A TEACHER WOULD WHICH OBVIOUSLY MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I'M. JUST UP AND EIGHT BUT I'M NOT JUST IN A BECAUSE I'M THE ONE THAT. FITS WITH THOSE KIDS ALL DAY LONG I'M THE ONE THAT HELPS TAKEN THROUGH. STEP BY STEP MATH LESSONS THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND TRY AND BREAK IT DOWN. TôI THEY'LL TO THE WAY THAT THEY WILL UNDERSTAND IT.

IT'S VERY HARD TO WORK WITH SPECIAL ED BUT WE DO CONTRACT OUT TO A LOT OF THAT OTHER. YOU KNOW LIKE LEARNING SOLUTIONS. THEY CAN MANDATE WORK WITH ONE STUDENT ONLY WE HAVE TO WORK. WITH ALL OUR STUDENTS AT THAT TIME. WE DON'T. GET A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY WHEN A TEACHER LEAVES AROUND TO ACTUALLY WORK WITH ALL OF OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE OF THE TIME. WE ARE THE ONLY ONES IN THAT CLASSROOM WE MIGHT HAVE AN ASSISTANT THAT COMES IN FROM ANOTHER DISTRICT ANOTHER IT'S BEEN CONTRACTED INTO US. THEY WILL NOT WORK WITH ANYONE BUT JUST THAT WHEN STUDENT.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME -- JOHN BRASS WHO LOCAL NINE NINE MEMBER -- STUDENTS ETA MEMBERS CTA MEMBER AND ALSO ANY A MEMBER. FROM I JUST WANT YOU GUYS TO APPROVE THE BUDGET -- WITH THE GOVERNOR SAID -- AWESOME BUDGET. ARM BUT THAT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PLANNING I THINK THE PLANNING SHOULD GO TO THE TEACHERS WE GET A LOT OF TEACHERS IN A LET PLANNING. IF NOT IN THERE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE THE COMMITTEE ACT WAS THAT COMMUNITY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY. IS A COLLECTOR OF PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAT NOTED FOR THINGS OUT THINGS WORK IT A MOVE A LOT FASTER A LOT SMOOTHER. OWN SPECIAL EDUCATION'S BEEN UNDER FUNDING FOR MULTIPLE YEARS -- I THINK WE ALL NEED TO SIGN A PETITION TO START STOP SAYING IN OUR WORK WE HAVE THAT GOING ON RIGHT NOW AT CERTAIN SCHOOL SIZE WITH ANY TO BE ADOPTED BY THE WHOLE NATION. SO WE CAN START WITH CALIFORNIA BEING A TREND SETTER FOR THAT -- I DEAL WITH STORIES WITH PARENTS CRYING BECAUSE THEY CAN GET FUNDING FOR THEIR KID WITH A DISABILITY OMITTED FOR FIVE YEARS TO MEET THAT FUNNY WE NEED TO HAVE A FASTER PROCESS FOR THAT. FOR THAT OUR TO EVERYTHING LOOK AT THE LEVEL EDUCATION STARTING FROM THREE ALL THE WAY UP TO JUNIOR COLLEGE SO WITH WITH THAT BEING SAID I FEEL LIKE WHEN THEY HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND WITH THE HELP OF YOU GUYS AND THE HELP OF ALL THESE GREAT PEOPLE BEHIND ME IN A PEOPLE TO SMOKE FOR ME WE CAN GET THAT DONE. AND I KNOW WAS THAT ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK WOULD YOU GOT TO LOVE IT WOULD SEEM TO GET THAT BUDGET APPROVED THANK YOU I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY BUT WHAT IS THE R. WORD. I WILL SAY IT ON BUT IS WHAT THEY USED TO CALL MENTALLY RETROVIRUS OKAY. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T. CATCH IT THANK YOU. OKAY. I AM I'M AGNES BRAGA I'M A SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY ASSISTANT WORKING FOR LAUSD AND I'M ALSO. SEIU LOCAL I. N. MEMBER AS WELL AS THE SECRETARY FOR THE E. BOARD -- MY EXPERIENCE AS A SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY ASSISTANT IS GOING TO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS SITES AND SEEING THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN -- AREAS LIKE THE WEST SIDE IN LOS ANGELES HAVING THE SUPPORT OF PARENTS WITH MONEY VERSES IN EAST LA ARE SOUTH CENTRAL WHERE PARENTS EVEN IF THEY WORK THIRTEEN HOURS A DAY. STILL CAN'T SUPPORT THE SCHOOL SITE. SO WHAT I'VE NOTICED IS THAT IN THE WEST SIDE -- THERE'S FUNDING. FOR YOU KNOW FOR WHATEVER THE SCHOOL NEEDS. AND THAT WAY KIDS ARE YOU KNOW WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS CAN BE SUPPORTED. AND I'VE ALSO DONE -- AUGMENTATIVE ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION WHERE I GO TO DIFFERENT SCHOOL SITES AND DROP OFF THE COMMUNICATION DEVICES OF STUDENTS WHO CAN'T TALK OR ARE PHYSICALLY DISABLED SO I'VE SEEN A DIFFERENT -- CENTERS THAT THESE KIDS WITH DISABILITIES GO AND THE LACK OF FUNDING MEANS THEY DON'T GET THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED. AND THROUGH THEIR I EP THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET YOU KNOW THE SUPPORT [inaudible] AND IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUNDING THEY FIND WAYS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE STUDENT AND THAT'S NOT GOOD. IF WE'RE WORKING TO TO HELP THE STUDENTS. AND IN REGARDS TO MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENTS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SEE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE STUDENTS AS A SPEECH ASSISTANT. AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DOCUMENT ALL THOSE STUDENTS ON WELL AGENT WHICH IS THE SOFTWARE THAT WE USE. AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO ALL OF THAT BY. TWO THIRTY AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE OUR LUNCHES. AND OUR BREAKS IN BETWEEN THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO DOCUMENT ALL THOSE STUDENTS. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS A PROBLEM WITH A LACK OF FUNDING IS THAT WERE EXPECTED TO DO THE WORK IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. AND NOT PAY US FOR THE DOCUMENTATION AFTER WORK THAT WE DO. SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO REALIZE THAT THE DISTRICTS THEY'RE DOING THEIR THING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KEEP THE MONEY BUT THE WORKERS ARE NOT GIVEN. WHAT THEY'RE AND THEY'RE IN IT? THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HI MY NAME IS ELIZABETH PARK I'M A SPECIAL ASSISTANT. I WORK FAIRLY UST AT NIGHT STREET ELEMENTARY. I HAVE BEEN -- WORKING IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND I CURRENTLY WORK IN A CLASS SO WHERE WE ASSIST WITH BE ICE. MICE SUGGESTION IS FOR THE GOVERNOR TO USE THAT UTILIZE THE MONEY TO HELP US SO THAT WE'RE NOT. ALLOWING THE NON PUBLIC AGENCIES TO CONTINUE BEHAVIORAL SO MANY TIMES WHERE THEY ARE FOR A RECESS AND LUNCH WE HAVE TO SUPERVISE THEM. THEY CAN ASSIST THEM WITH THEIR WORK. WE HAVE TO GET ON A BUS WITH THEM WE WILL HAVE TO BE THE WANTED TO GET ON THE BUS WITH THEM THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THE BUS RIGHTS WITH THEM. SO THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT NOT PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO AND I THINK IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE MONEY IS UTILIZED. TO HIRE MORE OF US TO BE IN THE CLASSROOMS IN TO GET THE TRAINING THAT WE NEED SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE SUPPORTIVE FOR SPECIAL ED. STUDENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU YES THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING TO SPEAK TO YOU ON THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES GRANT PROGRAM ITEM. CASH DOES SUPPORT THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP WITH OUR KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES. WE KNOW THAT THE DEMAND IS THERE WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR KINDERGARTEN KIDS AND ESPECIALLY OUR TKA KIDS ARE NOT ACTUALLY CURRENTLY BEING HOUSED IN FACILITIES. THAT MEET THE REGULATIONS SO THINK THE TINY TOILETS THE LARGER CLASSROOM SIZE I HAVE A KINDERGARTEN OR MYSELF AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE HIS LEARNING -- IT REALLY DOES IMPACT THE DAY AND THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN -- WE HAVE SORT OF A TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT WE BELIEVE CAN BE RESOLVED IT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU ADD A FACILITY -- THROUGH THIS PROGRAM YOU ARE GOING TO END UP BEING CHARGED AGAINST FUTURE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY BY ADDING THAT NEW CLASSROOM THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PENALTY AGAINST FUTURE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM BUT IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT CANDOR IT'S K. THROUGH SIX ELIGIBILITY WE THINK THAT THIS CAN BE. A PRETTY EASILY TWEAKED IN THE TRAILER BILL. THE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION IS WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW BEST TO TO PARK AT THE FUNDS AND WE APPRECIATE HEARING ABOUT TARGETING THEM TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS WE THINK THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REFINEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE IN THE PROGRAM.
