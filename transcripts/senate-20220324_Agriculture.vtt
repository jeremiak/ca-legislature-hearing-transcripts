INDUSTRY- BUT I DO HAVE TWO

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:05.263
OBSERVATIONS- ONE IS- THE 25%

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.165
NUMBER YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW-

00:31:07.232 --> 00:31:08.399

HIGHER OR LOWER BUT- IT'S A

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:14.339
POINT OF NOTE. IN THAT SPACE-

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.416
YET IN THIS FOR THE SPACE OF

00:31:25.483 --> 00:31:26.751
ABOUT POTENTIALLY TRADE WARS

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:29.187

THAT HAVE A CAUSE AND EFFECT-

00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:38.329
ONE ACTION CAN PRODUCE ANOTHER

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:40.798
REACTION AND SO. I KNOW THAT

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.367
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE IN

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:43.568

NATIONAL SECURITY. AND I THINK

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:19.370
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE- RARE

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:20.838
ITEMS. WHERE LABOR BENEFITS BY

00:32:20.905 --> 00:32:23.408
HAVING A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF WORK

00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:27.111
AND GOOD WORKING CONDITIONS-

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:30.248
BUSINESS- PROSPERS BECAUSE- WE

00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:33.017
REEMPHASIZE OVER AND OVER AGAIN

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:34.552

BACK- AMERICA. I THINK HAS

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:54.005
APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED THAT

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:56.607
BUYING AMERICAN IS A SOUND

00:32:56.674 --> 00:32:58.576
POLICY SO LONG AS IT'S DONE

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:01.346
FAIRLY AND ALLOWS OTHERS TO

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:03.147
COMPETE IN OUR MARKET PLACE JUST

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:05.950
AS WE WISH TO COMPETE IN OTHER

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:07.218
MARKETPLACES. I DID ASK THE

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:09.821
CONSULTANT AND- THE AUTHORS-

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:12.423
STAFF- TO LOOK INTO WHETHER OUT

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.858
THERE IT WOULD BE ANY ISSUES

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:16.594
WITH NAFTA- AND ANY OTHER FREE

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:19.897
TRADE- AGREEMENT THAT WE MAY

00:33:19.964 --> 00:33:21.966
HAVE THAT COULD INTERFERE OR

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:23.668
OVER STEP FROM AN AD FROM A

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:25.103
STATE STANDPOINT INTO A NATIONAL

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:27.038
AND INTERNATIONAL STANDPOINT. I

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.473
DON'T KNOW IF THE AUTHOR HAS ANY

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:29.273
COMMENTS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.044
THAT- THERE IS NO- PROBABLY

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:35.947
PROBLEM WITH NAFTA OR ANY OTHER

00:33:36.013 --> 00:33:37.248
FREE TRADE OBLIGATION WE HAVE

00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:39.117
YES AND THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:41.052
OF THIS REALLY COMPLIES WITH

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:44.188
THE- WITH THE PRESIDENT'S- BY

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:48.359
BACK AMERICA- PROGRAM IT IT'S

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:49.761
ALIGNED WITH IT AND IT DOESN'T

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:52.029
ON IT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS IT

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:53.431
DOES NOT- TRAMPLE ON ANY OF THAT

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:55.366
WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION

00:33:55.433 --> 00:33:59.003
GUIDELINES OR OR ANY OF THE-

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.306
OTHER TRADE- REQUIREMENTS THAT

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:03.674
WE HAVE. AND THERE THERE'S NO

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:06.911
QUESTION THERE'S ALWAYS IMPACTS-

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:08.413
AND THIS DOES NOT STOP THE

00:34:08.479 --> 00:34:11.349
IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS. FRESH

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:12.517
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTS

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:13.618
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IF THAT

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:15.853
HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.654
QUITE FRANKLY DURING THE WINTER

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.756
TIME ALMOST ALL THE FRUIT AND

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:19.624
VEGETABLES THAT YOU U. P. COME

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.459
FROM SOUTH AMERICA. SO IT

00:34:21.526 --> 00:34:23.261
DOESN'T STOP THAT BUT WHAT IT

00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:26.497
DOES DO IS IT FOCUSES. TAXPAYER

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.466
DOLLARS. AND SAYS IF WE'RE GOING

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:29.801
TO BE USING THESE TAXPAYER

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:32.069
DOLLARS TO FEED PEOPLE WHICH IS

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:33.905
WHAT WE DO WITH OUR SCHOOL LUNCH

00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:35.139
PROGRAM FOR SCHOOL FOOD

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:36.808
PROGRAMS. THAT THAT WE OUGHT TO

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:38.075
BE PRIORITIZING AMERICAN MADE

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:39.811
PRODUCTS UNLESS THE PRODUCT IS

00:34:39.877 --> 00:34:41.279
SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:42.814
FOREIGN PRODUCT MORE THAN 25%

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.549
SO. THAT THAT'S WHAT IT DOES

00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:46.217
AND- ACTION ARE UNDERSTANDING

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:47.718
THAT IT IS NOT. WE'LL KEEP AN

00:34:47.785 --> 00:34:50.822
EYE BALL ON IT AS IT MOVES

00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:51.456
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:52.390
SURE THAT. THE DATA

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:53.891
UNDERSTANDING IT IS TRUE AND

00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:55.560
THAT WE ADDRESS THE BILL IF.

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:58.062

I THINK I THINK MY- MY LAST MY

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:21.185
LAST POINT IS THAT- THERE WILL

00:35:30.361 --> 00:35:33.064
THIS DIRECTION AS I BELIEVE WE

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.131
