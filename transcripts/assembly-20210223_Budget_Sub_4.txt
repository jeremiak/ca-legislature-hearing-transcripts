BY AN ON THE CHAIR IN IN THE AGENDA SPECIFIC TO EASE BUDGET- WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY- VIA THE BUDGET ACT IT'S A PROCESS THAT ALLOWS EASY TO ADJUST OUR APPROPRIATIONS- TWICE A YEAR IN BOTH OCTOBER AND APRIL. EIGHT ALLOWS FOR ADJUSTMENTS TIED TO WORKLOAD- ANY CHANGES IN EXPENDITURES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY- FLUCTUATIONS TIED TO CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OF FEDERAL LAW- SUCH AS ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE PASSED. ON DURING THE PANDEMIC- AND AS I MENTIONED THIS DOES OCCUR- TWO TIMES A YEAR FOR BOTH CURRENT YEAR AND BUDGET YEAR WE CAN MAKE THESE ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR UNEMPLOYMENT PERRANCE PROGRAM- IN THE OCTOBER OUR OCTOBER ADJUSTMENTS WHICH WERE PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. EDT HAD SUBMITTED AN REQUESTED A CURRENT YEAR INCREASE OF SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN POINT SIX- PERSONNEL YEARS AND APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE BILLION. IN ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET AUTHORITY THAT IS ALL OF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS- FOR THE BUDGET YEAR CD INCLUDED AN ADJUSTMENT 430-009-0070 SIX POINT SIX PERSONAL YEARS AND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILLION IN FEDERAL RESOURCES WELL. AGAIN WANTED JUST TO MENTION THAT ALL OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE IN IN FEDERAL RESOURCES HI THERE ARE YOU AYE BASED FUNDING FOR THE VARIOUS PANDEMIC. PROGRAMS BE HAPPY TO ANY FURTHER OF OUR REFI IT JUST. OKAY I'M GONNA OPEN IT UP TO- THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF THEY HAVE ANY CURRENT QUESTIONS. YES OKAY WE HAVE OUR SHARE OF BUDGET MR TANG. SO OFTEN JUST- JUST OPENING QUESTION THE JUST MORE OF A COMMENT ON SORT OF THE STATE OF EDT HIS SON THEIR DEGREE YOU REALLY DIDN'T DO MUCH IN TERMS OF A BUDGET REQUEST A BUDGET AUGMENTATION CAN YOU SORT OF WALK US THROUGH OUR. YES I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I JUST CHECKING- SO AGAIN WE GET A JUST OUR BUDGET IT'S JUST IT'S NOT A FORMAL BCP. WE HAVE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET ACT THAT ALLOWS US TO ADJUST TIED TO WORKLOAD. AND SO AGAIN OUR OUR WORKLOAD ESTIMATES AT THE TIME OF REVISED. WE DID MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR DEPARTMENTAL ADMIN BUDGET AND OUR BENEFIT BUDGET. AND AS I MENTIONED THOSE ADJUSTMENTS IN IN THE YEAR THAT WERE IN. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL RESOURCES. AND THEN IN BUDGET YEAR IT WAS A SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILLION INCREASE IN FEDERAL RESOURCES. I SHOULD MENTION THAT- THAT DOES WORK ON ESTIMATES WERE BASED ON FAIRLY PESSIMISTIC ECONOMIC OUTLOOKS AND SO WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THIS- APRIL WHEN WE SUBMIT OUR ARE. UPDATED WORKLOAD ESTIMATES THAT THOSE MORE THAN LIKELY MAY COME DOWN SLIGHTLY- BUT ALSO WITH THE ADDED NUANCE OF THE MOST RECENT PASSAGE OF THE STIMULUS ACT IN DECEMBER. AND THEN ALSO WHAT'S OCCURRING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE MOST RECENT- BIDEN'S. FEDERALLY PACKAGE IF THAT GETS PASSED THAT WILL FURTHER- PROBABLY ADDED WORKLOAD INTO- NOT ONLY THIS YEAR BUT THE NEXT YEAR. THAT WASN'T PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED. SINCE THE YOU FEEL THAT- UP TOLD THE NOW AND EIGHT. YOU HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO WORK THROUGH THE BACKLOG AS WELL AS TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS BECAUSE- BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO. IT IS UNCLEAR TO US THAT YOU HAVE ADEQUATE. NUMBERS OF PEOPLE. WAR YEAH YOU READ THAT YOU DON'T HAVE AN ADEQUATE NUMBER PEOPLE OR IS IT THAT AN OFFICE TECHNOLOGY I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS. BOB I'LL GENERALLY ANSWER THAT I MAY- PUT THAT ONE BACK OVER TO EITHER NANCY OR CAROL BUT AGAIN I. THINK IT'S I DON'T NEED ANY GENERAL INTEREST THE SUPPORT TO THE TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THIS IS NOT. THIS IS THIS IS WHERE WE TALK SPECIFICS AND WE TALK MONEY SO IF YOU CAN'T ANSWER SPECIFICALLY THOSE KNOWN TO FEW COULD HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN. SO MET MISTER CHAIR SO AT ASKING OF MENTIONED WE ARE FEDERALLY FUNDED. SO I MEAN IF YOUR QUESTION IS WHY ARE WE NOT ASKING FOR MONEY FROM THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW FROM FROM THE STATE FUNDS. FOR THAT WELL WITH THE WITH MY QUESTION MIKE MY QUESTION TO CALEB AND YOU CAN ANSWER NANCY'S- IS. TIED TO IT DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES. IN TERMS OF STAFFING TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT TO TURN. R. X. INTO IS IN OUR EXPERIENCE HASN'T REALLY BEEN THE CASE. SO WE WERE A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED THAT THERE WAS NO- IN A BUDGET REQUEST BROUGHT FORWARD. SIX SO I CAN ANSWER THAT- THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION I MEAN YES WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE FEDERAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE WE CONTINUE TO. YOU KNOW WORK WITH THE- THAT I DID MINISTRATION AND LOOK FOR RESOURCES- AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES- TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE- YOU KNOW THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU. IT TOOK JUST- JUST FOR THE FOR THE RECORD JUST A COUPLE THINGS FROM MY DISTRICT OFFICE JUST TO NOTE. BASED ON THE MOST BASIC CASES IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE. SIX WEEKS BETWEEN SUBMITTING. IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY GETTING PAID. ARE WE STILL SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY. A FAIRLY LONG TIME FOR THE MOST SIMPLE OF CASES- THE NOTATION HERE IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT SEEMS TO NEED MORE TIER TWO. SPECIALIST OR OTHER STAFF WERE TRAINED TO RESOLVE ISSUES SO THAT THE WORK DOESN'T GET KEEP GETTING. PASSED ON TO OUR DISTRICT OFFICES I THINK WE I'VE MADE A NOTE THAT FEELS LIKE. IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES OF ALL BECOME SORT OF CASE WORKERS FOR EDT OVER THE LAST YEAR. IN THE AND THEN LASTLY THAT ANYTIME THAT THERE IS A TECHNOLOGY ISSUE. IT DOES RESULT IN HOURS OF OUR ALL OF OUR COLLECTIVE. THE STAFF TIME IN SO WE'RE WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN CASES. FROM CONSTITUENTS WITH EXTENSIONS DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY FILE SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW WHY WHY THAT BLIND. SORT OF AUTOMATIC FILING DOESN'T OCCUR AND WHY.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR SINCE CALIFORNIA WHEN THE LOCKDOWN THE PEOPLE OUT OF WORK NEEDING UNEMPLOYMENT ALMOST HERE WE STILL CALIFORNIA'S NOT GETTING DESERVE BENEFITS. AND ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE IN ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE SO WE'RE HEARING FROM SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS IS ON A CALL AND- EDT EMPLOYEE TOLD THEM TO CALL THEIR LEGISLATORS. AFTER THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN SO JUST IN ANSWER TO THAT BECAUSE LIKE I SAID WE'VE HEARD IT FROM MY STAFF WE FEEL THE PLAY CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND CALLS AND HELP INDIVIDUALS OUT WIRE EDT STAFF. TELLING THE CONSTITUENTS TO CALL THEIR LEGISLATORS. THANK YOU VERY IS WITH AT T. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE HAVE HEARD THAT AND WE HAVE. EXPLICITLY TOLD STAFF MANAGERS AND STAFF TO NOT- YOU KNOW TELL- SAY THAT TO CLAIMANTS WHEN THEY CALL AND THEY ARE DIRECTED NOT TO DO THAT- WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CHOOSE TO DO THAT WITH OUR STAFF TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT SAYING THAT- AND WE WILL DO IT AGAIN- I UNDERSTAND. YOUR CONCERN WITH THAT AND THAT IS NOT THE DIRECTION GIVEN BY EDT. OKAY OUR CONSTITUENTS WERE FINALLY GETTING PAID BENEFITS FROM LAST FEDERAL THE LAST RELIEF PACKAGE BEING TOLD BY E. D. THIS EXPECTS ANOTHER DELAY WITH THE NEXT EXTENSION. AS WELL SINCE EXPECTING THE SAME TYPES OF PROBLEMS WITH THE PROGRAMMING AND I. D. ME IS THIS TRUE. CAROL WILLIAMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE- JUST TO PUT SOME INFORMATION IN CONTEXT. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY FOR THE NEW PROGRAM WE'VE PAID FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ATE MY HALF BILLION DOLLARS- PHASE ONE IS COMPLETE CLAIM IT SHOULD BE AND CASE STATUS. PHASE TWO WILL BE COMPLETED BY MARCH SEVENTH AB- WE'RE NOT EXPECTING WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY DELAYS IN THIS NEXT PHASE SO FOR THAT IT IF I'M SORRY IF YOU COULD REPEAT THE QUESTION WAS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ID ME THANK YOU WHAT THEY'RE SAYING THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE LONGER THE EXTENSION. EMPOWER FALLS IS WITH PROGRAMMING AND ID ME HELLO OKAY. SO THERE'S A THIRD PHASE AND THAT'S THE MIXED EARNER THAT IS PHASE THREE THERE IS BUT TO ONE OR TWO STATES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS EXTREMELY COMPLEX PART OF THE NEW EXTENSION PROGRAM. EDT WE HAVE NOT THAT IS A PHRASE THREE WERE WORKING ON REQUIREMENTS AS WE SPEAK. UP IT IS EXTREMELY TECHNICAL AS WE UNDERSTAND IT AND COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT HOLES IN WAGE EARNERS AND FOLKS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING THE GIG ECONOMY WHICH IS WHY IT IS TAKING SO LONG AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERIFICATION FOR EACH OF THOSE TYPES OF EMPLOYMENT. SO THAT IS THE THAT IS WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE. WE ARE NOT ANTICIPATING I DO NEED A LASER IMPACTS WITH THE PHASE THREE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. ANOTHER ISSUE CONCERNS THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING DENIED THEIR EDT PAYMENTS BECAUSE YOU'RE UNABLE TO WORK AWAY FROM HOME. THE CITY TO SUPERVISE THEIR CHILDREN WHO WERE IN DISTANCE LEARNING IN FACT MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS WERE BEING TOLD BY EASY WORKERS. THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY HAD JOBS BUT HAD TO QUIT SIX DAY HOME TO BE WITH HER SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. IS THIS A MISTAKE- OR. THE PARENTS INELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CAROL WILLIAMS- WITH THE FACT THAT THE BLADE OUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS. IF IT'S DUE TO A OLD IT REASONABLE AREN'T ANYTHING ELSE THEY'RE ELIGIBLE WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND HAS TO DO WITH- RESUMING THE DEFERRED WORK THAT WE HAVE BEGUN SINCE THE BEGAN. IN EARNEST THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY AND THESE DETERMINATIONS AND HOW THE CLAIMANT IS ANSWERING THE QUESTION IT'S NOT THE CLAIM IS FALSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT EATING IS ABSOLUTELY LOOKING AT. AS THE ANTS NOW ANSWER THE RESPONSE IN TERMS OF- THE DETERMINATION WORK THAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE TURN OFF FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. AND ARE NOW RESUMING AND QUITE HONESTLY I DO BELIEVE SOME CLAIMANTS ARE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THAT BAND BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. AND WE HAVE TO FIX WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND SWEEPING THROUGH WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE IN THE DETERMINATION PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE RECEIVING THIS INFORMATION FROM US THERE. THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT WE HOPE TO HAVE A FIXED WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK WE CAN A HALF. CERTAINLY CAN REPORT OUT FRIDAY DENTAL DURING ALLEGE STAFF CALLS ON THIS PROGRESS. OKAY THEN THAT'S IMPORTANT- ALSO LATE LAST YEAR WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT ALL THE EASY EMPLOYEES. HAVING- COMPUTER AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I'LL TOLD BY THE I BELIEVE THE DIRECTOR I'M NOT SURE TOLD ME. ON DURING OF OUR CALL. BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT YOU ALWAYS SEE SOME EMPLOYEES. YOU ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE THAT WORK FROM HOME. ON SOME BASIS. BUT MOST OF THE PLAYS WERE TO WORK. SO SOME TAKEN DESKTOPS HOME- SOME OF THE GIVE A LAPTOP BUT- I WAS TOLD THAT'S NOT ACCURATE. ALL THE EMPLOYEES. ARE WORKING. FROM P. D. ON THE COMMITMENT BECAUSE SINCE HE- DOESN'T OPERATE ON CITRIX. THEY HAVE TO USE A STATE ISSUED EQUIPMENT IS THAT CORRECT. FOR ANY WORK WE DO REQUIRE STATE ISSUED EQUIPMENT IT SHOULD NOT BE AN IMPEDIMENT THOUGH BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S A DESKTOP BEING DEPLOYED. M. OR A LAPTOP THE WORK IF THE WORK ALLOWS ITS LENDS ITSELF TO BE WORKING FROM HOME THEY SHOULD BE AT HOME WE'VE DONE ASSESSMENTS ON TELEWORKING- SINCE THIS FALL TO ENSURE ALL THAT COULD WORK. THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE VERY DISTINCT CRITICAL WORKLOADS THERE'S UNFORTUNATELY STILL PAPER BASED AND BOTH EMPLOYEES- SAFELY HAVE TO COME IN THE OFFICE WHICH ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE LATE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EVERYBODY IN THE SAME. OFFICE AT THE SAME TIME AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH OUR APPEALS WORKLOAD IT IS ABSOLUTELY PAPER BASED WE'RE WORKING ON AUTOMATING IT. SO THAT WERE IN IT ONE DEPLOYS ARE ABSOLUTELY HEALTHY AND SAFE TO DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO THE OFFICE THE WORKLOAD CAN PRESUME AT A NORMAL PACE OF TURNING IT AROUND WITHIN TWO TWO WEEKS TWO TO THREE WEEKS. WHAT IS THE SAFETY REASONS THAT REQUIRE LIMITED STAFF FOR THE PAPER BASED WORK THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR US TO CREATE AN AUTOMATED FASHION. OKAY AND I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS IS FOR THE CONSTITUENT FROM LAST FRIDAY SUPPORT WHEN MY STAFFERS INTO THE EMAIL. I NEED HELP PLEASE. I CALLED UNEMPLOYMENT I WAS ON HOLD FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS. I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS PUT THE RUN OUT OF A PUT THE RIGHT HOURS WORKED. BECAUSE I HAD SO MUCH INFO REPORT. THE GUY TOOK ALL MY INFO WE HAVE MY NUMBER. WHEN ASKED LOOK AT MY CLAIM. I WAS DISCONNECTED. IF HAVE MY NUMBER HE SHOOK ME BACK. I'M OVER HERE. I KNOW IF THERE WILL. BE THREE THE HOLES OF MICHAEL. THANK YOU FOR THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE FOUGHT WILL FIRED BUT A LOT. BUT I GUESS THE BIG THING IS THAT WELCOME I KNOW YOU'RE PLEASE ENTER A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS AND I GET THAT. AS OUR BY OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR DISTRICT OFFICES THAT TAKE THESE CALLS FROM PEOPLE AT THEIR WITS END SO ACCESS BEEN GOING OFF FOR A LONG TIME. AND IT IN MY MIND. THE TIME TO PLAY CATCH UP IN IN FOR MISTAKES IS OVER. IT SHOULD BE PRETTY MUCH FINE TUNED WITH THIS. AND WITH THE ROLLOUT OF ID MAYBE. THAT WAS BOTH THE- HELP SPEED UP PLAYING BUT STILL WE STILL HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CLAIMS THAT ARE STILL BEING. HELD UP IN THE PROCESS SO. INELIGIBLE STATE ROUTE FIFTY A YEAR LATER. AND WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT NEXT MARCH'S DIGITAL MISTER KING EARLIER. THAT IT'LL BE BETTER BUT IT'S- AT SOME POINT- IT TO ME JUST DOESN'T CUT IT IS HAS BEEN. PROBLEMATIC FROM DAY ONE SO I'M HOPING ISRAEL IS THE CONSTITUENTS OF THIS GETS BETTER BECAUSE- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE- IT'S JUST. WHEN FACED WITH TRYING TIMES- PEOPLE VERY DESPERATE SO THANK YOU. OKAY. YES HI THERE THIS IS A THE SUMMER BLACKIE AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW- IF YOU HAVE ANY UPDATED CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS BEEN LOST VERIFIED FIVE VERIFIED FRAUD. OVER THROUGH THIS- SYSTEM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NEEDED VARIOUS- WITH EDT- WE HAVE NOT CALCULATED THE NEWEST NUMBER YET BUT WE ARE AND WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THAT- ONE OF THE- STATISTICS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN WAS THAT WITH A STOP PAY THAT WE DID BACK IN- AT THE END OF LAST YEAR- ABOUT 40% OF THOSE THAT WENT THROUGH ID ME ABOUT THAT ONE POINT ONE BILLION UP THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION THAT WENT THROUGH IDEA MADE. ABOUT 40% OF THOSE HAVE- CLEARED ID ME SO THAT'S ABOUT WHERE WE'RE LANDING IT'S NOT WERE WERE YOU KNOW SORT OF WAITING FOR THAT YOU KNOW FOR TILL THE END OF THE MONTH SORT OF THING JUST TO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WHO IS- WHO WANTS TO GO THROUGH I. D. NI HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH I DO NEED TO VERIFY THEIR IDENTITY. AND WE WILL HAVE UPDATED STATISTICS UPDATED NUMBERS- SOON ON THAT OKAY SO IS THAT DATA OR WHAT DATA RESULTS KENNEDY SHARE FROM ITS A THOMAS REUTERS FRAUD DETECTION SOFTWARE CONTRACT WITH US CENTER- AS FAR AS THAT THAT. REUTERS- DATA IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE YES AND. SEVEN- SO THE SO THE DATA THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT WOULD BE THE- THE ONE POINT FOUR THAT WENT THROUGH THE THOMAS REUTERS- BROAD CRITERIA AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND AS I JUST MENTIONED THE ONE POINT ONE THAT WENT THROUGH I DEEM ME I'M WE DO HAVE A BREAK DOWN OF THAT ONE POINT ONE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE WERE HAPPY TO- FOR THAT TO YOU THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WENT OUT IN THE PRESS RELEASE LAST WEEK AND ALSO HAS- GIVEN TO STAFF ON THE FRIDAY CALL WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU I'D LOVE TO HAVE THAT IN MIND WHERE FINAL QUESTION IS HOW LONG ARE THESE CONTRACTS EXPECTED TO LAST WITH THE- THOMAS REUTERS AND- ACCENTURE. THE EXTENT YOUR CONTRACT IS FOR ONE YEAR- AND THAT WAS JUST ENTERED INTO IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS- BUT THOMAS REUTERS CONTRACT I HAVE TO SAY I'M NOT I KNOW WE ENTERED INTO THAT CONTRACT LAST OCTOBER I'M NOT SURE OF THE TIME FRAME ON THAT- I BELIEVE THAT CONTRACT IS ONLINE BUT I'M CERTAIN I'M I'M HAPPY TO LOOK THAT UP FOR YOU CAN GET BACK TO YOU. ON THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY WE HAVE A MISTER TO ONLINE. GREAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF LET ME START FIRST WITH A FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION FROM OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIR MR TANG SO MANY BUSES LEGISLATORS WE ARE ASKED EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR EVERY DAY WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO TO FIX CDD AND WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AS WE PROVIDE A DVD WITH AS MUCH BUDGET AS A REQUESTED AND I JUST WANNA MAKE IT VERY CLEAR AT THIS MOMENT. YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR NEW BUDGET MONEY YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY SAYING YOU YOU YOU YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT- YOU BELIEVE YOU NEED YOU JUST NEED TO DEPLOY THEM AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THAT'S- WHERE. YOU THINK WE ARE AT THIS POINT. YES I THINK MY COLLEAGUE CAROL SAID IT SAID IT BEST AT THAT DATE WE HAVE THE THAT THE MONEY THE RESOURCES BUT WE NEED WE DO NEED TO HIGHER UP- AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. OKAY SO ASSUMING THAT THERE ARE SORT OF. TWO AREAS THAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE SPENDING AND I WANT TO JUST UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER. SO THE FIRST IS AROUND LANGUAGE ACCESS AND I KNOW YOU READ THE ANALYSIS AROUND THAT AND IF I MAY FOR JUST A MOMENT. SORT OF LAID OUT- SO AS YOU KNOW- LEGISLATORS WE'VE BEEN RAISING THIS ISSUE OF LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR. WE AS OF THIS MOMENT HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN MUCH INDICATION OF WHAT NEXT STEPS CAN BE TAKEN TO IMPROVE THIS. AS YOU KNOW LAST AUGUST WE SENT YOU A LETTER- BECAUSE IN PART A LETTER REFERENCED THE FACT THAT WE BELIEVE THAT. THE STATE WAS IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW UNDER THE DONNELLY AUTOREACTIVE. YOU ALSO KNOW THAT RECENTLY THEIR BAND. LEAGUE ORGANIZATIONS THAT BELIEVE THAT EDT IS IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAWS INCLUDING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. YOU ALSO KNOW THAT THE EDT STRIKE TEAM REPORTED THAT QUOTE INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT FLUENT IN ENGLISH. FACED INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS TO RECEIVING ASSISTANCE. AND AS THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS TODAY NOTES THERE BEEN NUMEROUS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE RAISED THIS ISSUE. FOR QUITE SOME TIME THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS NOT YET SEEN A PROPOSAL TO ENSURE LANGUAGE ACCESS AND I KNOW YOU ALSO KNOW. I HAVE A BILL THIS TOPIC- THAT MANY OF US ARE VERY INTERESTED IN AND I KNOW I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. ALSOJUST SAY. TO THIS PERSON IS WILLIAMS ALSO NO YOU ARE RECENTLY JOINING THE TEAM SO- THERE'S A LOT OF THIS PREDATES YOU BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK IN SUGGESTS THAT I REALLY DO HOPE WE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS. TO ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AND I THINK. WE NEED TO HAVE SOME FUNDING ATTACHED TO THIS- WE KNOW LANGUAGE ACCESS DOES NOT COME WITH WHAT YOU IF WE CAN'T ACHIEVE IT WITHOUT- WITHOUT INVESTMENT AND UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME. THAT YOU THINK SOME OF YOUR CURRENT DOLLARS CAN BE REDEPLOYED. TO ENSURE LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR EVERYONE. I SUSPECT WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AROUND FUNDING SO I WANT TO JUST GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON. A WHAT I'VE JUST LAID OUT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT NEEDS THE VARIOUS- EDT AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT- WE SHARE YOUR CONCERN- SURROUNDING LANGUAGE ACCESS THERE IS NO QUESTION CAROLINE I HAVE HAD IN. AND THE DIRECTOR OF HAD MANY MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND WE DO- VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU- ON YOUR LEGISLATION ON THE PROPOSALS OF- MANY LEGISLATORS ON THIS ISSUE- YOU KNOW BEFORE IT'S SORT OF AN INTERESTING. THING BECAUSE BEFORE CULTIVATED- YOU KNOW THEY WERE ACTUALLY MORE RESOURCES BECAUSE PAPER AND PHONE WERE MORE AVAILABLE- TO- PEOPLE. WHO WERE TRYING TO CALL AND I MAY HAVE HAD LANGUAGE ACCESS ISSUES- AND SO WE'VE TAKEN THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION OBVIOUSLY AND- YOU KNOW INTERNALLY WE HAVE. A TEAM OF PEOPLE. THAT ARE FROM ALL OF OUR BRANCHES- ACROSS THE NEEDY AND THE POOR FOCUSED ON SOME SHORT TERM ALSO SOME LONG TERM SOLUTIONS BUT- SHORT TERM WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE- MULTI LINGUAL. MIGHT MULTI LINGUAL ACCESS- AMOUNT HAVING A MULTI LINGUAL ACCESS PORTAL ON THE WEBSITE- EXPANDING TRANSLATION. OF THE U. Y. APPLICATION OF COURSE AND YOU KNOW LASTLY OF COURSE I'M STREAMLINING DAHLE MULTI LINGUAL PAPER APPLICATION PROCESS THAT. THAT WE CURRENTLY DO HAVE- THAT IT NEEDS TO BE STREAMLINED CLEARLY- WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED SOME OF THE EDT RESOURCES INTERNALLY I THINK- SOME OF YOU KNOW THAT- WE'VE DEVOTED- A SENIOR LEVEL STAKEHOLDER POSITIONS THAT. WILL BE HIRED SOON- DEVOTED TO ELLIE ELLIE P. ISSUES- IT. THIS PERSON WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENGAGING THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS FROM THE LEGISLATURE- IN JUST HELPING US- GO THROUGH SOME WORK THROUGH SOME OF THAT YOU KNOW YOU Y. ACCESS ISSUES- WE ALSO HAVE REACHED OUT TO OTHER STATES AND OTHER SISTER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA JUST AS THE START OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE OTHER- SOME OF OUR SISTER AGENCIES ALSO PROVIDE SERVICE TO PAY. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DOING WE'RE TRYING FIND YOU KNOW GET. FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE- AND WE DID AND I THINK EVERYBODY DOES KNOW THIS BUT- LAST SEPTEMBER. WE IMPLEMENTED THE SPECIFIC STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATION- REGARDING ELLIE P. ACCESS WHICH WAS BASICALLY JUST WE REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT- THAT MANAGERS HAVE TO FIRST APPROVE THE DECISION BY ACCLAIM WRAPPED WENT THAT U. P. R. AS THE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE CALL CENTER TO ACCESS THE LANGUAGE ACCESS LINE THAT WE HAVE. SO THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO DO THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE DID. AWHILE BACK- AND JUST IT JUST MAYBE CLOSE. YOU KNOW ONE THING COLLECTIVELY I KNOW THAT WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT. THE THE GREAT RECESSION AND SORT OF YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT- AND YOU KNOW WE DO AS WE MENTIONED WE DO HAVE THE RESOURCES. NOW YOU KNOW BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AFTER THIS LIKE AFTER WE HAVE SO WE HAVE THE RESOURCES NOW BUT IN A YEAR. OR IN TWO YEARS WHEN WE NO LONGER HAVE THOSE FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT'S REALLY WHEN WE NEED TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE AND LOOK AT IT AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO BE PREPARED. FOR UP TO THAT MOMENT SO WHILE WHILE I DO SIT HERE AND SAY THAT YES WE HAVE THE RESOURCES NOW. YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON. ON THE FUNDING AND THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED GOING FORWARD AFTER THIS YEAR IS DONE AND AFTER THE FEDERAL RESOURCES DRY UP. WE APPRECIATE THAT ANSWERS VARIOUS I CERTAINLY. I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL OUR COLLEAGUES AND SAYING THAT AFTER THE NEXT SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS WE HOPE TO SOLVE THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL SO THAT WE- DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS. I KNOW THAT LANGUAGE ACCESS IS. IT'S NOT TRUE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN- FIX OVERNIGHT- GIVEN THAT WE HAVE ONLINE CHANNELS WRITTEN CHANNELS- A CALL CENTER CHANNELS. BUT BUT THIS IS. OUR OFFICES HAVE JUST BEEN UTTERLY OVERWHELMED AND- AND I THINK BUT FOR THE BILINGUAL OR TRILINGUAL STAFFERS THAT MANY OF US HAVE IN OUR OFFICES. MANY OF THESE BOOKS WOULDN'T GET ANY ASSISTANCE WHATSOEVER AND IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY TAXING. FOR FOUR TEAMS SO. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I HOPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO REALLY. ASK YOU TO MAKE DECISIONS QUICKLY AT LEAST FOR THIS CURRENT PERIOD. THE OTHER COME TO HAVE A LANGUAGE ACCESS IS- BELIEVE IT OR NOT EDT IS NOT THE ONLY STATE AGENCY THAT IS STRUGGLING WHEN IT COMES TO LANGUAGE ACCESS WE'RE HEARING ABOUT CHALLENGES. IN THE HEALTH CARE CONTEXT IN OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE CONTEXT WHERE FOLKS ARE REALLY FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND- I WONDERED IF AS A STATE WE OUGHT TO. FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE WHERE LANGUAGE ACCESS TEAMS ARE ABLE TO WORK ACROSS DIFFERENT. AREAS TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION AT LEAST SWAT TEAMS THAT CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE IT IF NOT. BE THE TRANSLATORS THEMSELVES SO I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT BUT THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT- A SECOND TOPIC I WANT TO COVER AND THIS IS SOMETHING I WAS VERY SURPRISED NOT TO SEE- ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUEST FORM. HAVE TO DO WITH FRAUD AND I WOULD SAY. HAVE TO DO WITH FRAUD ON TWO LEVELS FIRST. IN ADDRESSING AND INVESTIGATING THE FRAUD THAT HAS HAPPENED. AT I REMEMBER. IT AT AT A PREVIOUS HEARING. WE WERE TOLD THAT YOU DO THE ONLY HAD SEVENTEEN INVESTIGATOR STATEWIDE AND HOPING THAT NUMBERS HIGHER NOW. BUT I WANT TO GET A SENSE. OF WHERE THAT IS- AT YOU ALSO KNOW- MANY OF US IN THE- WE HAVE BEEN. BY BYE BY OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT THEY ARE WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED TO INVESTIGATE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE FRAUGHT. AND SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PROPOSALS TO GRAPPLE WITH FRAUD BOTH TO ADDRESS IT THERE BUT ALSO. OF THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTED THAT QUOTE EDT FACES AN IMPENDING WORKLOAD. TO ASSIST VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT WHOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION WAS USED. TO FILE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS GIVEN THE HIGH LEVEL. A POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS AND PROCESS SEES FOR DRESSING THEM EDT IS UNDERPREPARED TO HANDLE THIS WORK SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. I THINK STATE AGENCIES NEED MORE RESOURCES TO GO AFTER THE BAD GUYS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE HONEST CALIFORNIANS WHO'VE BEEN VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT WHO CAN'T GET THEIR MONEY. WHO ARE WHO ARE WHO ARE LITERALLY CRYING ON THE PHONE BECAUSE BANK OF AMERICA WON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD MONEY STOLEN FROM THEIR ACCOUNTS WE NEED TO ASSIST OUR CONSTITUENTS AS WELL AND SO I WANT TO ASK YOU. WHAT IS THE PLAN AROUND EXPANDING RESOURCES AROUND FRAUD HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH BOTH OF THESE ARE CATEGORIES OF WORK AND- AGAIN I JUST HAVE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WHY DID YOU REQUEST ANY RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN. DEAL WITH IT WITH THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GETS THE VERY AS I CAN I CAN ADDRESS PART OF THAT I THINK THE SEVENTEEN- INVESTIGATORS I THINK THAT WAS MY FAULT I DIDN'T- MISSPEAK WEEK. WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH IS NOT- BUT MUCHHIGHER BUT THERE WE HAVE THIRTY TWO. PHYSICIANS WE HAVE- HIRED MORE PEOPLE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION- ONE OF THE FIFTH WAS THAT- WORKING THROUGH THE- THE COMPUTER IT'S- YES TASK FORCE WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. OFFICE WE HAVE A DEDICATED MORE RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION TO HELP. THE WHEN THERE ARE CASES THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE WORKING ON AND WE CAN HELP TOLD. SOME OF THAT DATA FOR THEM WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY HIRED BRENCHLEY IN THE PROCESS. RIGHT NOW OF HIRING I THINK SEVEN. HELP THE DA'S PULLED BY. TO PULL. THE DATA IN ORDER TO HELP THE D. WITH THE- OUR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION. THEY JUST JUST ON THE OTHER PIECE OF IT AS FAR AS- ASKING FOR MORE RESOURCES AND I CAN PUT MY COLLEAGUE- ADDRESS THE TEN NINETY NINE ISSUE BUT WE DO FOR RESOURCES IN THE FAT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE HAS BEEN SOME OF SEVERAL GRANTS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE HAVE YOU. IN THERE IT IS TO BE USED TOWARDS FRAUD AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE WE HAVE- USED IT FOR THOMSON REUTERS WE'VE ACTUALLY USED IT FOR THE INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION. WE ARE APPLYING FOR ANOTHER- GREAT- GRANT MORE GRANT MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO- TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME OF THE- THE OTHER YOU KNOW FRAUD- SOLUTIONS THAT WE HAVE. THIS WILLIAMS ARE OTHERS GIVE OTHER THOUGHTS ON. I DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I KNOW.

WHY DO I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION RELATED TO THE BUDGET REQUEST AND THIS INVOLVES A TOPIC THAT. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE TALKED ABOUT. PUBLICLY BUT THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU ARE REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO MAKE THE INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE FEDERAL LOAN. TO PAY BENEFITS BEFORE CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TRUST FUND BECOMES INSOLVENT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM ON A HOLD OFF ON THAT QUESTION FOR THE SECOND PANEL SINCE THAT'S WHAT THE SECOND ISSUE IS ABOUT. I'M SORRY THE- I CALEB ADDRESSED HE HE RAISED HE RAISES ISSUE WE ALREADY DISCUSSED IT SO I'M HAPPY TO ASK IT LATER BUT I KNOW HE ALREADY BROUGHT THAT WHY DON'T WE HOLD OFF UNTIL WE DO THE SECOND ISSUE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A MORE IN DEPTH CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ACTUAL BUDGET REQUEST. OKAY THANK YOU. THIS FONG AND I'M SORRY TO ME TO CUT YOU OFF A TO DO THAT WITHOUT YOUR LAST COMMENT BEFORE WE MOVE ON. SO WE COULDN'T GO BACK TO THAT QUESTION ON ISSUE TOO WE CAN GO BACK TO THE QUESTION. THANK YOU OKAY MR FONG. I THANK THE CHAIR- IN READING THE ANALYSIS IT MENTIONED THE- THAT THE SECONDARY BACKLOG. HAS SURPASSED THE MILLION CLAIMS. AND I WAS JUST. CAN YOU AND I APOLOGIZE IF THE IF THE STATE EARLY BUT WHAT IS THE CURRENT BACKLOG. AND WHAT IS YOUR TIMELINE. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE A MENTION TO THE CHAIR- THAT- BUDGET THE- MENTION IN THE BUDGET CHAIR THAT- IT MARCH AND APRIL IS GONNA GET BETTER BUT- DO YOU HAVE. MONTHLY BENCHMARKS YOU'RE TRYING TO MEET. AND ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG HOW DO YOU APPROACH THIS BACKLOG ISSUE AND WHAT WITH HOW FAST CAN YOU GET. THIS THE BACKLOG ED RESULT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAROL WILLIAMS OF THE TRY TO BEAT THEM. TRY TO BE BRIEF BUT COMPLETE. BOB BACKLOG IS DEFINED AS A CLAIM IT TAKES MORE THAN TWENTY ONE DAYS TO ISSUE THE FIRST OR FURTHER- PAYMENT FOR YOU TO BE ABLE ISSUE- A DISQUALIFICATION. AS YOU STATE WHEN YOU REFERENCE THE- THE NEW BACKLOG REFERENCING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED 1100% OF THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION BACKLOG CLAIMS IDENTIFIED BY THE EDT STRIKE TEAM. I'M NOT WITH THOSE WERE CLAIMS THAT WENT BACK FROM APRIL ALL THE WAY THROUGH SEPTEMBER. THE COMPLETE. PRESENTLY ON OUR WEB- IT SHOWS- EDV. OR THE CLAIMANT OR CLAIM IT NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION ON ONE POINT ONE MILLION CLAIMS THIS IS THE DASHBOARD FROM THE STRIKE TEAM. AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME IT WAS EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR EASY TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF ITS WORKLOADS RATHER NOT CLAIM IT NEEDED TO TAKE ACTION OR EDT. HOWEVER IT IS HARD TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO FROM THE DASHBOARD SO FOLLOWING THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITORS RECOMMEND RECOMMENDATION EVEN THE IS ADJUSTING THE DASHBOARD TO BETTER ILLUSTRATE HOW MANY CLAIMS ARE IN THE QUEUE WAITING FOR ATV ACTION BEYOND TWENTY ONE DAYS. I WILL BE USER FRIENDLY AND IT SHOULD BE OUT WITH THE NEXT TWO WEEKS ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WAITING MORE THAN TWENTY ONE DAYS FOR RESOLUTION OR FIRST PAYMENT OR CONTINUE PAYMENT. FROM EIGHTY THESE ARE THE NUMBER OF THE CLAIMANTS WERE EDB NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION. THE BACKLOG IS THE RESULT OF RESUMING ALL OTHER CRITICAL WORKLOADS THAT IS YOUR WE'RE WE'RE DEFERRED WHILE EIGHTY FOCUSED ON THE ONE POINT SIX. SO THE ONE POINT SIX WITH COMPLETED BUT WITH FEBRUARY FIRST ALL OF THE DEFERRED WORKLOADS ARE NOW IN FRONT OF IT. WE ARE. DOING A RISK ASSESSMENT ON THEM. AND IN THE WORK PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD. AND BECAUSE THERE ON WE ARE DOING DETERMINE. SO THE ONE OF THE THINGS THE STRIKE TEAM GAVE US WAS A GREAT TOOL TO LOOK AT ALL THE WORK THERE'S THERE ARE A LOT OF WORKLOADS. AND BE ABLE TO BE AGILE INCLUDES RESOURCES SO WHILE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE WAITING- WE ARE MAKING A CONCERTED EFFORTS TOWARDS THAT GROUP AS WELL ALL OTHER GROUPS. SO WITH THE ADDITIONAL STAFF THAT WILL BRING ON BECAUSE- ANOTHER REASON FOR THE BACKLOG IS FOR. FOUR MONTHS FIVE MONTHS EVEN IF YOU DID NOT HIGHER AND THIS IS THE FIRST WRITING RECOMMENDATION SO THAT THERE WAS A FULL FOCUS ON THE ONE POINT SIX. CERTAINLY HAS HAD ITS CONSEQUENCES. CONSEQUENCES IT RESOLVE THE ONE POINT SIX BUT HERE WE ARE TODAY NEEDING TO MOVE FORWARD WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING. OUTLINED BY THE STRIKE OF THE STATE AUDITOR IN DETAIL AND- EIGHTY DEGREES AT THIS POINT IN TIME I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. SO- SO I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE A LOT OF NUMBERS THERE SO AND THEN WE JUST MAKE SURE I GOT I GUESS I GET THIS. CORRECTLY THE U. I. BACKLOG AT THE STARTING SEPTEMBER WAS ONE POINT SIX YOU CLEAR THAT. THEN YOU HAVE. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY. FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS THAT ARE BEYOND TWENTY ONE DAYS PENDING. BUT THEN THERE ARE. DEFERRED CASES. THAT STILL EXIST. AND THAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE THAT THAT'S HOW WE GET TO OVER. A MILLION CLAIMS THAT. IN TERMS OF. TOTAL THANK YOU FOR THE CLERK. THE ONE POINT OR THE CLAY THAT ICE ABOUT THAT'S WITH. IN THE CURRENT DASHBOARD THAT'S ON OUR WEBSITE. THAT FACTORS IN- CLAIM OR ACTIONS THAT CLAIMANTS NEED TO TAKE. SOME FIGURING ONCE CONCERNED WITH THAT WE'RE CONCERNED BECAUSE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO OUTREACH TO LET THE CLAIM ITSELF YOU HAVE TO RETURN EVERY TWO WEEKS AND RECERTIFY YOUR CLAY. REMOVING THAT OFF THE VIEW. SO THAT YOU WILL ONLY SEE THE AMOUNT OF WORK. CLAIMS THAT EDT NEEDS TO ON THE DEFERRED WORK IS STILL BEING ADDRESSED IT IS HUGE. IT IS A CLEARLY ADDRESSED IN THE STATE AUDITOR REPORT AND IT REQUIRES A RISK ASSESSMENT BECAUSE IT IS SO HUGE THERE IS NO WAY. BUDGET RESOURCE IS A SIDE THAT WE CAN- NOT ONLY RESUME THE WORK BUT BE CURRENT IN A VERY SHORT ORDER IF WE DON'T CHANGE OUR PROCESS IS WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE PROCESS WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE MADE DECISIONS. STILL BEING IN LINE WITH ALL THE A WELL REQUIREMENTS SO THAT IS WHY THE STATE AUDITOR CALLED OUT EDT YOU NEED TO DO A RISK ASSESSMENT ON THAT WORK DON'T JUST DON'T TURN IT ON BECAUSE IT'LL TAKE YOU. A VERY LONG TIME TO GET CURRENT AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ANYONE SO OKAY. THE DEFERRED INTO DEFERRED WORK IS NOT PENDING CLAIMS THIRD THAT'S THAT'S THAT THE DATABASE AS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S THE CALLS THAT HAVE GOT EVERYTHING ELSE. SO RIGHT SAID SO THEN- RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ALL IF THE DASHBOARD IS BEING ADJUSTED BUT THERE'S TWO AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS THAT EDT HAS TO ADDRESS. THAT ARE THE ONLY ONE DAYS OR FURTHER. AND THEN THERE ARE THE OTHER CLAIMS ARE CLAIMS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS TO FOLLOW UP WITH. EDT ONLINE TO ENSURE THAT THAT PROCESS IS RESUMED. OR CONTINUES. THAT IS CORRECT AND THE- WHY THE ALL BE ALWAYS BE CONFLICT CLAIMS WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE CLIMATE BUT THEY'LL ALWAYS BE THESE CLAIMS WITH THE CLAIMANT HAS TO TAKE ACTION BECAUSE- OF. A LOT OF THE TIME I MEAN THEIR PRIMARY IS TO BE RE EMPLOYED RIGHT THAT IS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE. AND WHEN THAT OCCURS YOU OFTENTIMES THEY WILL WALK AWAY FROM THE CLAIM UNBEKNOWNST TO US- BUT IT'S A CRITICAL STEP THERE SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO DISASSOCIATE. THAT BROKE FROM THOSE THAT ARE EARNESTLY WAITING FOR EDB TO TAKE ACTION WE'RE GONNA KEEP OUR EYE ON IT WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE OUTBOUND CALLS THAT WE HAVE SINCE OCTOBER TO THE GROUP OF CLAIMANTS. THAT WERE REMINDING THEM- AND THEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HEARING- YOU KNOW I FOUND EMPLOYMENT I DON'T NEED MY CLAIM I'LL GO BACK AND CLOSE IT FOR YOU SORTS NOT ON YOUR BOOKS. WE DON'T WANT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT TO THE CLEAREST PICTURE OF THE WORK IN FRONT OF US SURE. I ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOCUS AND EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THEY MAY STILL NEED ASSISTANCE. THEY ARE STILL IN NEED. SO ABSOLUTELY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THEM AND THAT THERE'S A PROCESS AND A PROCEDURE IN PLACE SO WHAT. WHAT ARE WHAT IS THE EASY DEEP PROCEDURE TO ENSURE THAT. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU THAT THEY CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU OR IF YOU HAVE OR- AND WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO TO TRY TO GET THE CLAIM RESULT. MOST THE CLAIMANTS HAVEN'T ARE YOU WHAT ONLINE ACCOUNT THIS IS HOW THEY DO BUSINESS WITH US AND IT WORKS WELL WE SEND. MESSAGES TO THEM WE SEND EMAILS TO THEM REMINDING THEM AND WE ALSO STILL MAKE OUTBOUND CALLS TO CLIENTS THAT HAVE. THAT ARE NEARING THAT THE THEIR BEYOND THE TWO WEEKS THEY HAVEN'T RECERTIFIED. TO CONTACT THEM AND MAKE THEM AWARE YOU KNOW. THE MONEY IS HERE ARE YOU ELIGIBLE YOU STILL NEED DO YOU STILL MAKE THIS BENEFIT BECAUSE WE'RE HERE FOR YOU READY TO GO- WERE YOU IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW YOUR APPOINTMENT OR YOUR NEEDS. OKAY AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION TO JUST OF MY COLLEAGUES TO THAT WE ARE STILL GETTING PHONE CALLS AND BILLS MAYBE THE INDIVIDUALS. ANY ASSISTANCE SO THE INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE US. IN IN RE. TO ENSURING THE THOUSANDS OF. UNDER FOR. AND NO THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE HEARING. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE. THAT THAT THAT'S A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT NUMBER- AND SO THE- THE EDITION FROM NATION WOULD BE. HELP ON THAT- IN TERMS OF THE- IN TERMS OF THE PROTOCOLS IN IN TRAINING- WHAT I GET A LOT IN TERMS OF PHONE CALLS TO MY OFFICE AND I'M SURE OTHER MEMBERS OR TWO IS THAT. CLAIMANTS ARE ARE CALLING AND TALKING TO ET REPRESENTATIVES ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE AND THEN THEY'RE GIVEN DIFFERENT OR CONFLICTING INFORMATION WHAT IS THE TRAINING PROTOCOL TO ENSURE THAT. IF AN INDIVIDUAL CALLS THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE SAME INFORMATION CONSISTENTLY BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW THERE ARE WHAT'S AND THERE THERE AND THERE THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY. AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GET INFORMATION TO YOU BUT IF THEY'RE GETTING CONFLICT INFORMATION THAT THEY INADVERTENTLY CAUSES MORE CONFUSION AND COMPLICATIONS. YES BOB CAROLINE'S THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS ONE SET OF BOOKS FOR OUR STAFF. IT IS ONE PROCEDURE MANUAL AND IT IS NOW ONLINE I'M SURE IN THE PAST YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE- OUR INFORMATION WAS NOT ONLINE FOR OUR STAFF IS ALL ONLINE. AND IT IS THE SINGLE SOURCE WILL CONTINUE TO SEND REMINDERS TO THIS FEEDBACK IS GOOD IT COMES IN THROUGH- OUR BI WEEKLY SOMETIMES WEEKLY. WITH YOUR STAFF THAT WE NEED TO GET IN THERE AND REMIND STAFF AND PRESENT THIS INFORMATION MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THEY'RE UNDERSTANDING THESE MESSAGES SO THAT THE INFORMATION IS CONSISTENT BUT IT IS A SINGLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION. SO THERE SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSION AND AGAIN- WE DEFINITELY REGRET THAT OKAY. AT THE END OF THOSE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT I MEAN THEY GO BACK TO THE TO THE OUR FIRST CONVERSATION I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT REDEFINING AWAY THE PROBLEM. THAT THAT PROP THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS STILL NEED HELP AND THE PEOPLE CALLING INTO OFFICE STILL NEED HELP IN THE WORD WE'RE GIVING THEM ASSISTANCE- AND MY LAST QUESTION I DO APPRECIATE. YOUR DEPARTMENT ASSIGNING LIAISONS TO EACH OF OUR OFFICES- TO HELP US RESOLVE. THAT THE CASE IS THAT OF INDIVIDUALS ARE CALLING EVERY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN EVERY STATE. SENATOR- IS A WAY TO. GET GIVE THEM ACCESS. OR TRAINING. SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO RESOLVE CASES- IN A REAL TIME MANNER INSTEAD OF HAVING TO KIND OF. GO BACK AND CHECK FOR US OR GO BACK AND- AND DO ADDITIONAL WORK. IT WOULD MAKE SENSE I GUESS IN MY MIND. THAT THOSE WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO OUR OFFICES ARE. ABLE TO. ADDRESS AND FIX THE CLAIMS AS THEY SEE FIT IF IT CAN BE RESOLVED IN THAT MANNER. AND AS A RESULT THE BACKLOG EVEN QUICKER IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE- SOBER LIVING LIKE IF YOU BACK. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAROLYN SO TAKE THE- TAKE THE FIRST PART OF THIS QUESTION IN NANCY MAY WANT TO- JUMP IN- THE HELP BUT UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION SO LET ME JUST TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE INCREASED THE HOURS THAT OUR STAFF ARE ASSIGNED TO YOUR STAFF. TO AND- MOVE REMOVE THE BARRIERS FOR PAYMENT FOR THESE CLAIMANTS AND WORK THESE COMPLICATED CASES OFTENTIMES TO COME GET IT SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT THEY JUST NEED TO BE IN TOUCH WITH US BECAUSE THERE. THERE ACCOUNT IS SOMETHING CLEARLY HAS HAPPENED TO IT IS NOT. IN THE 90% THAT IS PURELY AUTOMATED FROM START TO FINISH YOUR STAFF WERE CLEARLY INVOLVED IN THE 10% OF THE MANUAL WORK WORKS IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME INTERVENTION. SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS INCREASE THE HOURS THAT THEY ARE WORKING THESE CASES. OKAY I MEAN I THINK THAT'S THAT THAT WOULD I'M TRYING TO STREAMLINE A FULL THE PROJECT. AND SO INSTEAD OF FOR IT. IF YOU NEED TO DO THE WORK THAT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING AND- DEFINITELY APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF THEY ARE INVALUABLE- NONE OF US SAW THE PANDEMIC COMING- BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT ME TO DO. MORE OF OUR PARK OKAY WELL I WOULD JUST ADD AND TO SUGGEST THAT IF YOU CAN GIVE THE LIAISON STORE OFFICES- MORE ACCESS AND MORE TRAINING TO RESOLVE SITUATIONS- IN REAL TIME- NOT. AT THAT MAYBE SO AND HELP HELP AND MAYBE HELP US FACILITATE THAT TO- THAT MAY EASE SOME STRESS OFF OF YOU IN THE MAIL HE SOME STRESS OFF OF US AS WELL SO- SOMETHING THAT I HOPE THAT THAT YOU'LL TAKE BACK INSIGNE AND SUGGEST- AND KIND OF PONDER OVER BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WOULD. BE HELPFUL I APPRECIATE THAT THE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER FONG I'LL SO SEVERAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE PAST WE STILL CONTINUE TO SEE ISSUES RELATED TO LANGUAGE COMPETENCY ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY- BEING ABLE TO GET SOMEBODY ON THE PHONE SO THESE ARE ALL ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE REYES AND THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A PART OF IN OTHER HEARINGS AS WELL- AND SO I GUESS IT IS RATHER SURPRISING THAT GIVEN. THE COMPLETE LACK OF RESOURCES AND THE BACKLOG THAT THERE IS AN AN AND AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUEST TO KIND OF CLARIFY THOSE ISSUES INCLUDING- THE CALL CENTER AND SO. ARE THESE- DO YOU PLAN ON AND EXCUSE ME IF I MISSED IT EARLIER BUT DO YOU PLAN ON ADDRESSING THE SOMETIME LATER IN THE BUDGET ASK. MADAM CHAIR NEED TO VARIOUS WITH EDT- SO AT THIS TIME- WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE- REQUESTING MORE RESOURCES. IF WE IF WE DO FIND THAT WE NEED THEM WE CERTAINLY- I BELIEVE WE CAN USE AND- IT'S- THE MAY REVISE PROCESS OR THE OCTOBER REVISED PROCESS TO REQUEST- MORE RESOURCES- AS AS YOU KNOW CALEB MENTIONED THAT THE BE IT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE ARE FEDERALLY FUNDED WE DO HAVE AMPLE FEDERAL RESOURCES RIGHT NOW- BUT AGAIN TO CLOSE THE LOOP AT SOME POINT THOSE RESOURCES WILL. DRY UP I SUPPOSE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY OF SAYING IT AND WE WILL NEED MORE RESOURCES THAT IS. LIKELY NOT TO HAPPEN- DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT IT LIKELY WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE PANDEMIC AND WE AS WE- OF COURSE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW WE ARE READY FOR WHATEVER COMES NEXT- HOPEFULLY NOT ANOTHER PANDEMIC BUT- WE KNOW WHATEVER THAT IS THAT'S REALLY WHEN. WE AREN'T WHAT WHEN WE WOULD NEED TO- YOU KNOW WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE REALLY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR THAT NEXT THING. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M HEARING IT MISS VERY IS THAT YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY BUT YOU HAVE BEEN FULLY STAFFED UP YET. WHICH YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING. AND SO THE WORKLOAD CONTINUES TO BE IMPACTED BASED ON THAT AND- OUR STAFF AND MOSTLY OUR DISTRICT STAFF WHICH IS TASKED WITH DEALING WITH A LOT OF THE EDT CASES. AND MANAGING THOSE CASES. NEEDS ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS I WANT TO ECHO MR FONG- YOU COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS REGARDING THE EDT LIAISON TO EACH. ASSEMBLY OFFICE BECAUSE WHILE IT WORKS SOMETIMES IN MOSTLY DOESN'T JUST BASED ON BANDWIDTH. AND I WOULD IMAGINE THE BANDWIDTH AND WORKLOAD OF THE EDT LIAISON TO. THAT'S PROBABLY BEING SHARED AMONG MULTIPLE OFFICES. AND SO WHOEVER THE INDIVIDUALS ARE DON'T HAVE CAPACITY IN BAND WITH TO DEAL WITH ALL THE CASES THAT ARE COMING IN THROUGH THE DISTRICT OFFICES- IN THE CONSTITUENT CASES SO WE COULD REALLY USE. YOUR YOUR SUPPORT ON THAT AND FINDING A FULL TIME DEDICATED LIAISONS THAT CAN ANSWER A QUESTION SO THAT WE ARE ALSO NOT. WAITING FOR RESPONSES AND ALSO A NEVER NEVER ANSWERED EMAILS OR BEING ON HOLD ON THE PHONE FOR A LONG TIME AS WELL SINCE IT'S ESCALATED AT THAT LEVEL. I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS I WANNA THANK YOU DIDI FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS FROM LAST MONTH'S HEARING THAT WERE DUE OUT THIS PAST FRIDAY. AND DIRECTOR SIGNS RESPONSE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT IT TAKES ABOUT TWO TO FOUR WEEKS FOR IDENTIFICATION VERIFICATION. HOWEVER NEWS REPORTS AND CONSTITUENT FEEDBACK HAS SHOWN THAT THIS PROCESS CAN ACTUALLY TAKE SIX WEEKS OR MORE AS WAS STATED EARLIER. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SPEED UP THIS PROCESS OBVIOUSLY WAITING SIX WEEKS OR MORE TO BE. RE VERIFIED ON ID MEANWHILE. YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY TO FEED YOUR KIDS OR YOUR LIVING YOU KNOW ALREADY AT ADD. YOUR YUR AT YOUR MEANS AND AFRAID OF BEING AN- ARTIST. FEDERA PLAYS A MENTAL HEALTH TOLL ON EVERYONE THAT'S AFFECTED BY I BY THIS PANDA ANSWER. WAITING FOR THE SAFETY NET OF EDT TWO. SO WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO TO SPEED UP THIS PROCESS. CANTERBURY'S THANK YOU- FOR THAT COMMENT WE CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW. UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE RE IN AND WE ARE- VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT AND WE ARE WORKING- TOWARD TOWARDS- THAT AND ON ON I. D. I WILL SAY THAT- MOST OF THE PEOPLE 90% OF THE PEOPLE GO THROUGH ID NEED WITHIN. A MATTER OF. A COUPLE OF DAYS AND ARE PAID- BY- ET DEEP WITHIN I THINK SEVEN TO TEN DAYS IS THE AVERAGE- THOUGH THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET THROUGH ID ME AS AS- YOU POINTED OUT NOT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO. ON YOU YOU AYE ONLINE OR ID ME- THEY WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PAPER PROCESS- THROUGH EDT OR THEY CAN CALL IN. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN HELP THEM WITH THAT AND I DOES TAKE LONGER BECAUSE IT IS NOT AUTOMATED- WE ARE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO SHORTEN THAT TIME FRAME- AND YOU KNOW AND DO KNOW THAT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE HEARD THAT FROM THE LEGISLATURE. BEFORE AND FROM CLAIMANTS BEFORE AND WE ARE DOING OUR ABSOLUTE BEST TO- STREAMLINE THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- ONE MORE FOLLOW UP QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE AREA IS- IN BANK OF AMERICA'S LETTER WHICH WAS ALSO DO THIS PAST FRIDAY. RESPONDING TO OUR QUESTIONS THAT WERE NOT- ANSWERED IN THE EARLIER HEARING THAT WE HAD IN ABOUT A MONTH AGO- IT WAS STATED THAT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CARDS WERE FROZEN BY THE BANK DOES BANK OF AMERICA CONSULTS WITH EDT WHEN FREEZING THESE CARDS. OR DOES EDT CONTACT THE CLAIMANT OR DO THEY STILL NEED TO WAIT FOR A BANK OF AMERICA LETTER- BANK OF AMERICA WHEN THEY FREEZE THE CARDS DATE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT CONTACT THE CLAIMANTS. OKAY SO DO THEY SEND THE AND I JUST WANT CLARITY ON THIS BECAUSE WE'VE GOTTEN SOME MIXED INFORMATION SO WHO MAKES THE DECISION OF FREEZING THE CARD IS THAT BANK OF AMERICA OR IS THAT EDT. SO BANK OF AMERICA WILL FREEZE THE CARD WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. DEBIT CARDS WE HAVE ACCESS TO WE ONLY PROVIDE BANK OF AMERICA WITH THE FUNDS TO SO WHAT WHAT EDT DOESN'T IS WE CAN DO A STOP PAY. BUT BY BANK OF AMERICA WILL FREEZE THE CARDS. IF THEY FIND FRAUD BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW I MEAN AS THEY HAVE SAID IN SEVERAL HEARINGS IN THE NATION WIDE FRAUD ISSUE AND THEY HAVE- THEIR OWN PROCESS FEES AND REGULATIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH. ON A FEDERAL LEVEL. THANK YOU I'M NOT QUITE SURE MR IS THAT I THAT I TRULY UNDERSTAND AND HAVE CLARITY ON WHO MAKES THE DECISION THAT THERE'S FRAUD. IS THE TWO FOLDERS IT EDT MAKING A DECISION AND THEN TELLING BANK OF AMERICA AND IS IT ALSO BANK OF AMERICA THROUGH THEIR SYSTEM ALSO IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL FRAUD SO IT'S BOTH. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND YES IT IS BOTH SO WE BOTH HAVE SO EDT HAS A PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH THE WHICH WE'VE SAID BEFORE THE I. D. NEED THOMSON REUTERS THERE'S AN INTERNAL FLAG THAT WE HAVE. IF THE PERSON THE CLAIMANT HAS PASSED THROUGH THAT SO TO SPEAK THEN THERE IS NO IF WE DON'T FIND FRAUD. WHEN THE WHEN WE THEN SAY OKAY THERE'S NO FRAUD AND THAT PAYMENT GOES TO BANK OF AMERICA BANK OF AMERICA SEES THINGS AS THEY MENTIONED IN THE PAST HEARING THAT EDT DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO. LIKE TRANSACTIONAL HISTORY FOR EXAMPLE SO IF SOMEONE GOES TO AN ATM WE DON'T SEE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SORT OF FRAUD SO THAT'S THE FRAUD THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO. AND THEY CAN THEN FREEZE THE CARD IF THEY FIND IN FRAUD FOLLOWING REGULATIONS THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT THEY HAVE- BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY'RE AN INTERNATIONAL. MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BANK. RIGHT NOW IT CLICK CLEARLY IN THE PAST TEN YEARS OF A GOOD PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN EQUALLY BENEFICIAL TO BANK OF AMERICA. SO  GUESS AS AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT NEXT STEPS AND THE RENEGOTIATING THE BANK OF AMERICA CONTRACT WITH EDT. AM I HEARING THAT THESE ARE POTENTIAL THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR IN TERMS OF WHO IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING A HOLD OF THE CLAIMANT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE ON ONE SIDE IT'S- EDT MAKES ONE DECISION BASED ON THE INTERNAL PROCESSES FOR FRAUD. BANK OF AMERICA HAVING ACCESS TO- THE TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT DECISION. YET WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL CONTACT OF THE CLAIMANT THAT'S WHEN THINGS GET A LITTLE LOOSE IN TERMS OF WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS TO. GET A HOLD OF THAT INDIVIDUAL. IS THAT ACCURATE OR- THAT AND THAT IS ACCURATE AND I AND I WOULD SAY THAT- EDT WE DO YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE TO FOLLOW DEPARTMENT OF LABOR REGULATIONS AND THERE IS DUE PROCESS. SO WE DO PROVIDE NOTICE- TO CLAIMANTS WHEN WE PUT YOU KNOW WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS ON THEIR ACCOUNT AND WE HAVE TO PUT A STOP PAY WE DO DO THAT- THAT IS FROM THE ELIGIBILITY SIDE WHEN THEY COME INTO EDT AFTER IT LEAVES AFTER THAT. THE PAYMENT LEAVES EDT THEN THAT IS WHEN IT LIES WITH BANK OF AMERICA TO GIVE NOTICE PER THEIR OWN BANKING REGULATIONS ON WHAT THEY WOULD DO FOR ANY PERSON WHO HAS A BANK CARD. OKAY GOT IT THESE ARE SOME INTERESTING LITTLE DETAILS I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO. TAKE A REALLY CLOSE LOOK AT AS WE FIGURE OUT NEXT STEPS ON THE FRAUD A CONVERSATION ON WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS. THANK YOU FOR THAT PRECIADO- WE DIDN'T GET ALL THE RESPONSES BACK FROM BANK OF AMERICA BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO BEING FOLLOWING UP IN TERMS OF THE QUESTIONS THAT OVERLAY WITH THE EDT DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS OUR NEXT STEPS FOR HOLDING. THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY CAN BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR- ISSUE NUMBER TWO BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I DO APOLOGIZE WE DID NOT GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM THE ALLULOSE OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS RELATED TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAD ALAMO WITH THE L. A. WE WERE ON THE PANEL TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS RELATED TO THAT THE OVERSIGHT ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ALLEN MISTER JIMENEZ. HI MARK MENACE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE DONE I AM HAPPY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE I AS AND QUESTIONS- GREAT LET'S DO THAT AND I KNOW THAT- MR PEROT ACTUALLY MADE SOME EARLY COMMENTS ON B. HE DID THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I KNOW MR CHIU HAD ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THAT WHY DON'T WE MOVE FORWARD IN MR. PEROT CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A BRIEF OVERVIEW ONE MORE TIME AS WE ENTER INTO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. YES GOOD AFTERNOON- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- ONCE AGAIN CALEB WORRELL CHIEF OF FISCAL PROGRAMS DIVISION FOR THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET REQUEST. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND. TO MAKE THE FIRST INTEREST PAYMENT ON A FEDERAL LOAN. THE STATE RECEIVED AN ORDER CONTINUE PAYING. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS. AFTER THE U. I. FUND BECAME INSOLVENT AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. WHEN THE STATE'S YOU I TRUST FUND BECOMES INSOLVENT. THE STATE IS STILL OBLIGATED BY FEDERAL LAW. TO PAY BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE WORKERS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. BEGINNING IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINE NECESSITATING LOANS. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO KEEP UP WITH BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO UNEMPLOYED WORKERS. WE RECOGNIZE THEM AS THE L. A. M. NOTES IN THERE RIGHT AFTER. THAT THE INITIAL ESTIMATE WHICH WAS PREDICATED ON A FAIRLY PESSIMISTIC ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. AND ALSO DID NOT INCLUDE RECENT LOAN INTEREST FORGIVENESS. THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE MOST- CURRENT STIMULUS ACT. THAT WAS PASSED IN DECEMBER. THAT THE THAT THOSE TWO RESULTING PIECES WILL DEFINITELY RESULT IN. THE PAYMENT BEING LOWER COME SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN THAT PAYMENT BECOMES DUE- ADDITIONALLY IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING. THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S COVET NINETEEN RELIEF PACKAGE THAT'S- MAKING ITS WAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. DOES CONTAIN FURTHER INTEREST RELIEF. THROUGH THE END OF AUGUST WHICH COULD MEAN. ULTIMATELY ONE MONTH OF INTEREST PAYMENTS. FOR STATES IN THE FIRST YEAR BORROWING. THE DEPARTMENT WILL UPDATE THE ESTIMATED LOAN INTEREST AMOUNT AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAYOR VISION. AND IT WILL BE FURTHER UPDATED BASED ON PROPOSED BUDGET LANGUAGES THE PAYMENT DATE GETS NEAR. IN SEPTEMBER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST. AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT A CAN HEAR FROM THE ADD TO. OF FINANCE AS WELL AS THE ALEJO'S OFFICE PLEASE. MISSILE MORE WHEN WE GO WITH YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAD ALAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- OUR OFFICE- REVIEWED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IN JUST A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS TED TO BUILD ON ON WHAT WAS JUST MENTIONED BY MISTER WORLD ON AS HE NOTED ABSOLUTELY THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INTEREST PAYMENT ESTIMATE WAS BASED ON WHAT IS NOW OUTDATED ECONOMIC INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY THE END OF DECEMBER EXTENSION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR- YOU AYE ENHANCEMENTS EXTENDED THE INTEREST WAIVER ALSO AS MISTER OR MENTION WE THINK THESE TWO CHANGES COMBINED ARE LIKELY TO REDUCE. INTEREST PAYMENT DUE IN SEPTEMBER FROM FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS I'M DEFERRED. IT MAYBE LIKELY- WITH THE PASSAGE OF A ADDITIONAL ACTS AND CONGRESS THAT THE WAIVER WOULD WOULD BE PUSHED TO AUGUST- AS MISTER HALL MENTIONED MEANING MAYBE JUST ONE MONTH OF INTEREST TO YOU I WE WON'T KNOW THAT UNTIL SOMETIME BUT WHAT UPDATE. FOR THE MAY REVISION. THE ONE ADDITIONAL POINT THAT WE WANT TO BRING UP HERE IS THAT FEDERAL LAW DOES. ALLOW A PROVISION UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND ASSENS DURING. ERA INSTANCES OF ELEVATED UNEMPLOYMENT I ALLOWS THE STATE TO DEFER PORTION OF THEIR INTEREST PAYMENTS INTO FUTURE YEARS- SPECIFICALLY THAT THE STATE. IS AS WE BELIEVE ELIGIBLE TO THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THIS YEAR'S INTEREST PAYMENTS INTO THE FUTURE ON PAYING ONE QUARTER IN IN EACH OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND IMPORTANTLY INTEREST ON THIS DEFERRAL- WOULD NOT ITSELF ACCRUE INTEREST I'M SO THERE'S NO FISCAL PENALTY PER SE- TO DIFFERING THIS YEAR'S INTEREST PAYMENT- WE RECOMMEND THAT. AT THIS POINT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE SMALLER ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS INTEREST PAYMENT AND ALSO TAKE ACTION TO- AVAIL ITSELF OF THE DEFERRAL. I WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE UPCOMING SEPTEMBER INTEREST PAYMENT- FROM FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION IN TOTAL TO ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS WE ESTIMATE. I'M FINALLY AGAIN ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THESE NUMBERS WILL ALL BE REVISED BOTH BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND OUR OFFICE AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION- BUT IT'S HELPFUL IN OUR VIEW TO GET A SENSE OF. WHERE THE SCOPE OF THIS INTEREST PAYMENT IS AT THIS POINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER JIMENEZ. HI MARK MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- JUST. WANTED TO REITERATE THAT WE WILL BE PROVIDING THESE ESTIMATES IN THE MAY REVISED- WE'RE ALSO HAPPY TO WORK WELL WITH YOUR WITH YOUR STAFF AND ALL THE- IT'S BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSALS THAT- THE LTO JUST PRESENTED- IT DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE FOR YOU ON AND DEVELOP THE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS TALKING MAYBE FIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT WE'RE GONNA GO NOW TO MEMER COMMENTS QUESTIONS- MISTER TO ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM MEDICARE THANK YOU AND- APPRECIATE THE BACKGROUND ON THIS ITEM- I'VE BEEN DIGGING IN A LITTLE BIT TOO THIS IS NOT A TOPIC WE DISCUSSED I THINK IN THE SUB COMMITTEE- AND- MIGHT MY HEADLINE FOR THIS PORTION THE CONVERSATION COULD BE. OUT OF THE FRYING PAN INTO THE FIRE AND BY THAT I MEAN WE HAVE SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THIS YEAR ON. THE VERY INTENSE AND IMMEDIATE CRISES IMPACTING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH A U. Y. SYSTEM THAT UP I'M CONCERNED IS FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN- THE COMMITTEE REPORT. ALLUDES TO THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA'S. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TRUST FUND BECAME INSOLVENT SINCE PRIOR TO JUNE TWENTY TWENTY AND IS POJECTED TO REMAIN SOLVENT THROUGH AT LEAST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND IT LAYS OUT WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES TO THE STATE TO THE TUNES OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF WE- DO NOT PAY THESE INTEREST PAYMENTS WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIAL. NOT SURE IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THE OP ED THIS WEEK THAT WAS PUBLISHED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE STANFORD INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC POLICY RESEARCH. BUT WHAT HE LAYS OUT AND I'LL JUST. MENTION THIS IS A YEAR AGO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELEASED ITS ANNUAL SOLVENCY REPORT OF STATE YOU Y. PROGRAMS AND RANKED CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM DEAD LAST. AMONG ALL FIFTY STATES NOW CALIFORNIA'S YOU AYE PROGRAM IS NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. AND THE OP ED LAYS OUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A FUNCTION OF THE FACT THAT OUR SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY REGRESSIVE. IS FUNDED AT TWO WOEFULLY INADEQUATE LEVELS AND SIGNIFICANTLY HURTS LOW WAGE WORKERS AND SO MY QUESTION I APPRECIATE WE'RE ALL TRYING TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS I WANT TO ASK. THE E. D. LEADERSHIP WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE NEED FOR LONG TERM REFORM OF THE SYSTEM WHERE'S YOUR THINKING ON THIS BECAUSE- THE IDEA THAT- THAT- MADAM CHAIR AND I AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP VOTING ON FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INTEREST PAYMENTS. ON SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE GRAPPLING WITH- MAKES SENSE TO ME AND YOU KNOW I THINK IT WAS THIS VERY ISSUE SAID- WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO FIX THE SYSTEM FOR THE LONG HAUL AND IT SEEMS TO ME WE ARE NOT. WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LONG TERM. FACING ARE YOU AYE SYSTEMS A LOT BUT SOME COMMENT ON ON THAT. I MEAN. NUMBER EIGHTY VARIOUS WITH EDT- YOUR COMMENTS ARE VERY WELL TAKEN- YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL- RIGHT NOW TO FIX THAT BUT WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION. MOVING FORWARD ON THAT. BOB WHAT I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO FIX HE D. AT THIS MOMENT AND OBVIOUSLY. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS ARE CONSTITUENTS SHUTTING DOWN FRAUD THESE ARE TWO THINGS WE NEED TO DO NOW. BUT IF IT IS POSSIBLE FOR US TO HAVE ANOTHER- SIMULTANEOUS CONVERSATION- AGAIN PAIN HALF BILLION DOLLAR INTEREST PAYMENTS IS NOT PRETTY I I'M SURE ALL OF US IN THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE COULD THINK ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE COULD SPEND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT THIS TIME. THIS IS A SITUATION THAT PREDATED ALL OF US- BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE PRETTY GOOD FROM WHAT I MIGHT EARLY CONVERSATIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES. FROM LATE. WELL AS FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND OTHERS IS I THINK THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. STABILIZE THE SYSTEM FOR THE LONG HAUL AND I'D BE INTERESTED IN HAVING A CONVERSATION SIMULATOR- IF NOT YOU KNOW THIS MONTH THEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS THIS YEAR- AND I'LL JUST ASK THAT EDT LEADERSHIP WHENEVER YOU WANT TO ENGAGE IN THIS. I'D LIKE TO AS WELL. I APPECIATE THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CHAIR- ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER TO APPRECIATE THAT I THINK A WE ALL WANT TO HAVE SOLUTIONS TO THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES WITH EDT ONE OF THEM BEING THE SYSTEM THAT IS INCREDIBLY. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND ANTIQUATED AND SHOULD PROBABLY AT THIS POINT SIMPLY BE REPLACED. AND WE WILL GET TO THAT WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME- FOR THAT COMES UP BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT- INTERESTED IN TRYING TO FIX AND IND A SOLUTION FOR. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYONE. AND I DID I DID SAY EARLIER THAT WE WERE GONNA. I TRIED TO GO THROUGH OUR NINE ISSUES- WITH WITH THE APPROPRIATE TIME SO WE ARE IN ISSUE NUMBER THREE THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES WE HAVE TIM RAINY FROM THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD MICHAEL CABLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLUMBING TRAINING PANEL MISTER CHAZ ALAMO WITH ELLY ELLS OFFICE AS WELL AS MISTER JIMENEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. LET'S BEGIN ON ISSUE NUMBER THREE MYSTERY. THANK YOU CORREO I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY WE CAN HEAR YOU TO BRING NINE. THANK YOU I TEN RAINY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. I WAS HOPING I COULD GO THROUGH I JUST A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER THE WHAT AT WHAT WE'RE DOING- A LITTLE BIT ON THE WHY WE'RE CREATING A NEW DEPARTMENT- AND THEN FINALLY THE HOUSE. JUST A BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE STEPS TAKEN TO MOVE FORWARD- AND THEN OF COURSE- WOULD LOVE TO. TAKE QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE RESPONSES- MICHAEL CABLE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL IS HERE AS WELL- TO FIELD QUESTIONS. WHAT LET'S PROPOSAL- WHAT SCHOOL. CENTER LAST YEAR AT THE GOVERNOR MADE THIS PROPOSAL YEAR. RAINING JUST BE CLEAR YEAR ON THE PHONE NOT ON CAMERA. I AM ON CAMERA ACTUALLY- WE CAN ASSURE YOU IT'S ALL DARK- WE CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE BUT WE CAN'T SEE YOU- THERE YOU GO OKAY OKAY WE- BUDGET IN MY CAMERA- SO AS I WAS SAYING- THE WHITE OF THE PROPOSAL IS THAT IT'S THE SAME PROPOSALS LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR PRESENTED- IT IS TO CONSOLIDATE FOR WORKFORCE ENTITIES. WITHIN THE LABOR AGENCY INTO A SINGLE WORK FORCE DEPARTMENT- THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD ANY EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL- COME WHOLE CLOTH INTO THE NEW DEPARTMENT THAT THE DIVISION APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS IS PULLED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY RELATIONS- ARE IN THE WORKFORCE SERVICES BRANCH IS PULLED FROM THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT INTO THE NEW DEPARTMENT SO IT IS A TWO STEP PROCESS- THE STATUTORY CHANGES ARE THIS YEAR. ASIDES pRELATED TO THE FOUR ENTITIES INTO A NEW DIVISION SIX OF THE LABOR CODE WHICH IS BEFORE YOU THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- THAT THE NEXT STEP IS THE BUDGET PROCESS UP NEXT YEAR BY THE CHANGES IN BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR- WHERE THE NEW DEPARTMENT WILL SUBMIT A BCP. FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE REQUESTING THE BOOK OF. IT ENDS UP BEING. D. I. R. SO COURSE THE VICIOUS HERE. WILL IT MEANS THE WORLD BURKE OF UP TO AND UP THE DEPARTMENT WHAT WE'VE ALREADY. HI VERY QUICKLY UP TO REACH FOR THAT TELEVISION THE FIRST IS. FOLLOW FONG WORKS RIGHT IT WORKS FUNCTIONS THE DEPART MENT WITHIN DEPARTMENT MISTER RANEY. I'M GONNA OF FOR A MOMENT- IT SEEM LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE VIDEOS IS AN- YOUR AUTO. WHY DON'T WE TURN OFF YOUR YOUR CAMERA JUST SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU. SURE LET'S TRY AGAIN WE LOST YOU FOR LIKE THIRTY SECONDS. MY APOLOGIES AGAIN- TECHNOLOGY IF YOUR FRIEND AND YOUR WORST ENEMY SOMETIMES. I OKAY START AGAIN I'M THE Y. IT THAT FORGIVE ME- TO TWO MAIN REASONS THE FIRST IS FORM SHOULD FOLLOW FUNCTION- THE WORKFORCE SERVICES THE BRANCH IS INSIDE AN APARTMENT AS WE TALKED ABOUT A GREAT DEAL- TODAY. IT'S PART WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON BENEFITS AND TAXATION INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DIVISION APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS IS A WORK FORCE FUNCTION WITHIN A DEPARTMENT WHOSE PRIMARY FOCUS IS LABOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO THEY CONSOLIDATED WORKFORCE DEPARTMENT WILL FOCUS ON WORKFORCE INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS AND REGIONAL TALENT DEVELOPMENT PATHWAYS TO QUALITY JOBS EQUITY IN INCOME ABILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED GOOD JOBS AND FORCE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WE FEEL LIKE THIS FOCUS ON WORKFORCE IS AS URGENT AS ANYTHING WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THE SECOND IS- IS FOR SYSTEM ALIGNMENT TO GET GREATER IMPACT THROUGH SCALE A SCALE AND IMPACT- THE WORK. FOR SERVICES. OUT WHAT PRESERVES THE JOURNAL ARE ARE DELIVERED LOW- AND IF ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENTS. AND ENTITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I IN EACH OF THESE FUNDING STREAMS COME FROM DEPARTMENTS IN SACRAMENTO THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MAJOR MISSIONS IN DIFFERENT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS INSIDER. SO IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. FOR COMPANIES AND WORKERS TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM. SO WE'RE CREATING THIS CALL COMPLEXITY UP BY THE FACT THAT THESE FUNCTIONS ARE MINISTERED THROUGH MULTIPLE AGENCIES IN SACRAMENTO AND THEN GO DOWN TO MULTIPLE AGENCIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT SERVICE CULTURES REQUIREMENTS DATA. COLLECTION PROCESSES IT'S STATURE. THE END OF THE DAY. THE PEOPLE WERE MOST TRYING TO SERVE. OUR FINDING THE SYSTEM- THIS PATCHWORK THAT VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE- THE FIX. CAN'T BE JUST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE SPENT. MANY YEARS MICE IN- UPGRADE. WILL WORKFORCE PER. AT TO BE MORE ALIGNED- SO IT SO THAT THE SYSTEM IS LESS COMPLEX. AND MORE NAVIGABLE. HE HE THE FACT IS WE CAN'T FIX THIS JUST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS I SAID WE CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR THIS- THIS PATCHWORK IN SACRAMENTO AND WASHINGTON DC- SO. IN FACT THIS PURPOSE OF MAKING IT MORE NAVIGABLE FOR WORKERS WHO MOST NEED SERVICES AND FOR COMPANIES IS IT I THINK EXACTLY WHY. THE NEW DEPARTMENT IS SUPPORTED BY. BOTH LABOR AND BUSINESS WE HAVE SEVERAL LETTERS I THINK THAT HAVE COME INTO THE COMMITTEE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THAT MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE CAL CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION- AND TWELVE OR THIRTEEN LETTERS. OF SUPPORT HAVE COMIC COME IN BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT OF THE SYSTEM ON'T LOCAL WORKERS AND BUSINESSES AND HOW CAN BE IMPROVED THROUGH THIS STREAMLINING. THAT WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THE STATE LEVEL- OR NOT COMPLETELY THERE EVEN IF WHEN WE OUR IF WE- CONSOLIDATE THESE. THESE ENTITIES INSIDE THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY THERE STILL ARE AT LEAST THIRTY WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. THIS IS FROM LA- THIRTY WORKFORCE PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED THROUGH THIRTEEN DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS. AND SEVEN AGENCIES IN SACRAMENTO SO THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR CONTINUED MR MISALIGNMENT FRAGMENTATION THAT CONSUMES. UP PRECIOUS TIME AND RESOURCES FOR JOB SEEKERS WHO DON'T HAVE TIME AND RESOURCES. SO IS A SAID THE CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE LABOR AGENCY. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT FIRSTSTEP. TO MAKE IN A SYSTEM. THAT IS- IS WORKING BETTER FOR WORKING PEOPLE IN THE STATE I BELIEVE IT'S THIS IS GOOD GOVERNMENT- AND THEY QUICKLY ON THE HOUSE AND THEN ALL. OF A HAND IT. OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE HE'S GOTTEN IT YET I WILL JUST ASK THAT YOU WRAP UP YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE. OF COURSE. THE HOW IS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF ALIGNING THE FOUR ENTITIES- AND WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS OUTLINING ASTRUCTURE FOR NEW NEW DEPARTMENT WERE FOLLOWING THE GULF OPS MANUAL FOR THIS WORK. I HAVE NINE WORK GROUPS. THAT HAVE BEEN ACTIVE FOR THE- FOR THE LAST YEAR- BETTER. GOING DEEP INSIDE THE ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGING STAFF WE'VE GOT MORE GROUPS ON NINETY SIX YLIDES FISCAL PERSONNEL SECTOR. AND AN ACTING LEADERSHIP THAT REPRESENTS THE EXISTING ENTITIES. GUIDING THIS WORK THAT THE CURRENT DIRECTORS OF THE FOUR ENTITIES. AND IN THE PROPOSAL IS A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT WOULD BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE- THAT PERSON WILL TAKE OVER LEADERSHIP AND THEN A NEW CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. WILL BE APPOINTED AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT. MR CABLE. YES MY CABLE. TRANSALPINA AND I THINK TIM HAS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN AND LAYING ABOUT PERHAPS THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD SINCE MY FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS TO JUST POINT OUT THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHICH HAPPENS BASICALLY HE TAKING SINCE WE HAVE THESE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF EITHER THE U. I. CHO TO THE LABOR CODE IT'S ESSENTIALLY A LIFT AND A DROP INTO A NEW DIVISION SIX SO THE ONE ITEM THAT I DID WANT TO POINT OUT IS THERE REALLY IS. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LEGISLATION IT'S MUCH MORE UPBEAT MOVEMENT. AND ALIGNMENT WITHIN THE LABOR. THANK YOU MR CABLE MR ALAMO. JAZUSAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THREE BRIEF POINTS WE WE'D LIKE TO POINT OUT WITH REGARD TO- THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT- IN THE FIRST- WE POINT OUT IN A ANALYSIS WE PUBLISHED TWO WEEKS AGO THAT THE STATE'S EXISTING LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY PERFORMS MANY OF THE COORDINATED FUNCTIONS THAT ARE% PROPOSED FOR THE NEW DEPARTMENT ITSELF- THE- LABOR AGENCY WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND I'M- QUOTING- ANELLI- REPORTED THAT TIME THE AGENCY WAS CREATED TO FIRST. IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ACCESS TO SERVICES ELIMINATE PROGRAM DUPLICATION ENERGY COST EFFECTIVENESS- ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES- WOOD- CONSOLIDATE ENTITIES TO IMPROVE EQUITY FOR WORK FIRST PARTICIPANTS. PROVIDE EFFICIENCY. AND ENHANCE CUSTOMER SERVICE- AND SO AS YOU CAN SEE IN AND IN OUR VIEW THIS QUITE A BIT OF OVERLAP IN THESE TWO MISSIONS AND ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT- SEEMS AT THIS POINT WELL WITHIN THE ORIGINAL AND ONGOING RESPONSIBILITIES OF LABOR AGENCY ITSELF WHICH OVERSEES EACH OF THE ENTITIES PROPOSE FOR CONSOLIDATION. ON THE SECOND POINT IS ALSO RELATED TO SERVE BREAD AND BUTTER PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND THAT'S THAT. AT LEAST TO DATE ARE A CLEAR PROBLEM WITH THE EXISTING STRUCTURE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED- AND SO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LEGISLATURE IT'S DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THE PROPOSAL WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THE- PROBLEM IS INTENDED TO BE SOLVED- IT ALSO WOULD MAKE SETTING ACCOUNTABILITY GOALS FOR THE FUTURE DIFFICULT FOR ASSESSING. HOW THE NEW DEPARTMENT IS PERFORMING IN THE FUTURE OUT RATHER DIFFICULT WITHOUT HAVING A VERY SOLID SENSE AT THIS POINT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS TO BE SOLVED. AND THE THIRD ISSUE THAT WE RAISED IS- FAR AWAY THE MOST IMPORTANT IN OUR VIEW AND THAT'S SIMPLY RELATED TO TIMING WHICH THE PANDEMIC- THAT PROPOSED REORGANIZATION WHICH SHIFT. SIXTEEN HUNDRED STAFF FROM ED'S WORKFORCE SERVICES BRANCH- TO THE NEW DEPARTMENTS- AT A TIME WHEN AS AS WE ALL KNOW AND HAVE DISCUSSED. THIS AFTERNOON EDT IS STRUGGLING TO HANDLE ITS WORKLOAD RELATED TO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE I'LL POINT OUT. THE WORK FOR SERVICES STAFF CURRENTLY ARE NOT WORKING ON DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS ADMINISTERING YOU WIPE BENEFITS. C. WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DEDICATE SOME RESOURCES AND ATTENTION. TO THE COMPLEX REORGANIZATION- OF THIS NEW DEPARTMENT AT A TIME WHEN- THOSE EFFORTS. HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE EDT YOU AYE BACKLOG AND SO IN OUR VIEW MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT DEPARTMENTAL REORGANIZATION NOW WHILE THE STATE IS IN THE MIDST. OF THIS CRISIS- POSES SERIOUS REST TOO EDIE'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING BACKLOG- AND CONTINUE MAKING- TIMELY BENEFIT PAYMENTS FOR YOU AYE RECIPIENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER JIMENEZ. BY MARK MINUTES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WANTED TO DRIVE A COUPLE OF POINTS- YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS CREATED ALL WORKFORCE PROGRAMS IN VARIOUS ENTITIES IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC NEEDS AND AVAILABLE FUNDING I'M THIS HAS RESULTED IN IN A FRAGMENTED BURKE OR SYSTEM AND THIS REORGANIZATION IS INTENDED TO BETTER ALIGN- A LINE DATA POLICY PROGRAM ANALYSIS WITH THE STATE'S WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND TO CREATE A GREATER ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY A NEW AND INNOVATIVE INITIATIVES THAT THE QUESTION WILL BE EFFECTIVE BEING- AS WELL AS WE- LOOK TOWARDS THE QUICK RECOVERY OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY FALLING THE PANDEMIC I'M I'M HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS PROPOSAL. IF YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND GO TO THE MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE THANK QUESTIONS LUCKY. YES MR ALAMO INDICATED- AS THE PROPOSED DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES BUT IT REALLY DOES NOT READ YOUR DIRECT E. D. STAFF DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO YOU WHY BUT WOULDN'T MOVING I'D THE NUMBER I'VE BEEN GIVEN IS ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SIX. STAFF FROM FIFTEEN PROGRAMS A DVD WHEN IT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WORK LOADER SUPERMAJORITY TIME RELATED TO THESE YOU LIFE PROBLEMS. I CHEN RAINY CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE WORK OF PLANNING AND DESIGNING AND PROVIDING LEADERSHIP- OVER THE PROCESS FOR THE NEW DEPARTMENT- IS TAKEN ON BY THE LEADERS OF THE FOUR ENTITIES THAT AFFECTED THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR DEEP- THE WORKER SERVICES BRANCH OF EATING AND THE DIVISION APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS OF THE I. R. SO THIS. SHOULDN'T AND IT AND IT HASN'T. CAN SIGNIFICANT ENERGY AND RESOURCES AWAY FROM EATING- THE INTENTION IS TO FOCUS ON THE WORK FORCE PEACE. MOVE IT OVER TO THE NEW DEPARTMENT SO THAT WORKFORCE GETS MORE- GETS MORE ATTENTION. OKAY THAT I FIND THAT TO BE PERPLEXING BUT- I MEAN IT WAS JUST DESCRIBED AS A LEFT IN THE DROP. AND THAT'S A PRETTY BIG LEFT ALMOST FIFTEEN HUNDRED STAFF FROM FIFTY PROGRAMS FROM AN AGENCY THAT'S ALREADY HAVING. IMMENSE PROBLEMS TO SAY THE LEAST AND DELIVERING SERVICES AND I CAN'T TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY FAIR COMMENT. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS IS WHILE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISRUPTION WITH EDT AS WE'VE HEARD IN THE LAST- TO ISSUE AREAS AND VARIOUS DIFFERENT HEARINGS. NOT JUST IN THIS ONE BUT IN OTHERS. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISRUPTION WITH EDT IN THE LABOR AGENCY IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR THE LABOR AGENCY TO SHIFT FOCUS AWAY FROM RESOLVING EDIE'S CHALLENGES AT THIS TIME. HI THIS IS JIM RAINY CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT DOES SHIFT FOCUS IN FACT IT'S REALLY THE ROLE. AS A MISTER ALMA POINTED OUT THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE ALIGNMENT OF WORK FOR SERVICES AND PROGRAMS. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THIS IS THE NEXT STEP A BIG STEP OF OLD ONE. TO ALIGN THOSE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS FOR THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA- BEEN IMPACTED BY CODE ON THE GROUND- IT AND- NEED SERVICES TO GET BACK TO WORK WHAT A MOVING TO BETTER JOBS. SO I THINK THERE'S AND THERE'S- AN IMPORTANT URGENCY AROUND DOING THIS. AND I BELIEVE. AND WE BELIEVE- IN THE LABOR AGENCY IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT NOW IS THE TIME. TO MAKE THIS MOVE. AND WE WILL BE. OUT AT THE VERY CAREFUL. NOT TO PULL NECESSARY FOCUS AWAY FROM STRENGTHENING EDIE'S WORK. ON PROVIDING BENEFITS THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR OF YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THAT WE RAISED IN THIS COMMITTEE AND ANOTHER HEARINGS AS WELL HAS BEEN JUST THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LABOR AGENCY. WE MAY POTENTIALLY BE LOSING OUR SECRETARY OF LABOR. READING OF VACANCY WE HAVE A VACANCY IN THE UNDERSECRETARY OF LABOR WE HAVE BACON SEASON VARIOUS DIFFERENT DIFFERENT. A DEPUTY DIRECTOR POSITIONS WITHIN THE AGENCY ITSELF. AND SO WHO WILL. WHO WILL ACTUALLY BE IN CHARGE. THIS IS TOO MANY AT CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID I WASN'T SAD THAT SECRETARIES WHO. WHAT WAS GOING TO- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR- SHE'S BEEN AN AMAZING- FORCE. IN DOING SO MANY GREAT THINGS IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE LABOR AGENCY FOR WORKFORCE IN PARTICULAR DRIVING THIS AGENDA AROUND HIGH ROAD THAT IS REALLY DEFINING THE WORK OF THE NEW-DEPARTMENT. THE DAY TO DAY WORK- IS WILL STILL BE CARRIED ON AS I SAID- BY THE- THE LEADERS OF THE EXISTING ENTITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE PROGRAMS- IN ADDITION TO THAT THE PROCESS THAT WE INITIATED. OVER A YEAR AGO- GOES DEEP INSIDE OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS- SO. THE INTENTION- AROUND HIGH ROAD FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS DEPARTMENT. EXECUTIVE RELIED ONE LEADER IN FACT IT'S REALLY BUILT IN A TO THE PROCESS AND IN ALL THE STAFF INVOLVED OR DRIVING THAT WILL CONTINUE NO I UNDERSTAND. WHO WILL ACTUALLY OVER THE TRANSITION AND HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE. IF THE TRANSITIONAL HAPPEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR UNTIL WE PRESENT AT B. C. P. BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. OPPORTUNITY TWENTY THREE- SO THAT THE LEADERSHIP IS GONNA BE AGAIN PROVIDED BY THAT THE DIRECTORS OF THE EXISTING DEPARTMENTS IN ADDITION TO THE NEW LABOR SECRETARY WHEN. I WHEN THAT PERSON IS APPOINTED- AND AS I SAID BEFORE. IN THE PROPOSAL. IS- AT THE A NEW POSITION EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT. THAT WOULD BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR- HOPEFULLY SOON AS POSSIBLE IS THIS LONG SINCE THIS PROCESS MOVES QUICKLY- AND THEN CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. AND THEN IT CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR WILL ALSO BE HIRED. TO HELP PROVIDE THAT LEADERSHIP SO THEY CAN DISTINCT. LEADERSHIP BUT THEN REPORT TO THAT. NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. OKAY SO BOTH POSITIONS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR JUST LIKE THE SECRETARY OF LABOR IS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AS WELL AS THE UNDERSECRETARY OF LABOR IS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR JUST LIKE. DEPUTY DIRECTORS ARE ALSO CURRENTLY VACANT. WITHIN THE AGENCY. I JUST I HATE TO- BELABOR THE POINT BUT IT'S JUST. IT'S A IT'S A LITTLE- HI I'M LOOKING FOR A BETTER WORD JUST IT'S KIND OF EXHAUSTING TO THINK ABOUT CREATING NEW DEPARTMENTS WHEN WE HAVE DEPARTMENTS THAT STAB SO MANY VACANCIES AND WE HAVE YET TO REALLY FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE MANAGE AN EDT SYSTEM. WITH THE POTENTIAL TRANSFER OF WHATMR LACKEY STATED CLOSE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED. EMPLOYEES BEING SHIFTED TO A NEW DEPARTMENT WELL WE JUST HEARD EDT SAY THAT WHILE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES ARE NOT FULLY STAFFED UP. TO ACTUALLY MANAGE THE CURRENT WORKLOAD AS ALL OF OUR LEGISLATIVE OFFICES HAVE BECOME. EDT CLAIM ADJUSTERS AS WELL SO I PUT THAT OUT TO YOU IN TERMS OF THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH. HOW DO WE CREATE NEW DEPARTMENTS THAT WILL OVERSEE THINGS THAT ARE OF VALUE AND THAT ARE IMPORTANT. WELL WE HAVE DEPARTMENTS THAT CURRENTLY DON'T FUNCTION. SO. I JUST CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THAT. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JIM RAINEY CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- AGAIN THE WITH THE INTENTION HERE IS TO PULL THE WORK FORCE FUNCTIONS OUT OF EDT ARE SO THAT HE CAN BETTER FOCUS ITS LEADERSHIP. ON UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND OTHER BENEFITS PROGRAMS THAT YOU NEED THE OVERSEAS- AND AT THE SAME TIME GET THE KIND OF FOCUS THAT WORKFORCE NEEDS AND THAT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA NEED. FOR RECOVERY. SO THE WAY WE SEE IT THE WAY WE'RE APPROACHING IT IS NOT TO TAKE AWAY FROM YOU NEEDED BUT ACTUALLY HELP FOCUS AGAIN ON ITS CORE MISSION. WHILE ALSO FOCUSING MORE INTENTLY ON THE WORK FOR SIDE OF THE HOUSE. THAT WOULD BEGIN WITH GETTING PEOPLE ACCESS TO SERVICES REDUCING THE COMPLEXITY OUT THERE IN THE FIELD- IT IS- IS VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW. BUT IT'S ALSO GONNA BE IMPORTANT I'M GOING. THANK YOU FOR THAT NOW I AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. JUST THAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF PROPOSALS ON YOU DEPARTMENTS WITH A LACK OF DETAILS AND LACK OF DIRECTION IT'S JUST MAKES IT DIFFICULT. THAT WHILE WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH REAL ISSUES RELATED TO. COVERT NINETEEN AND RECOVERY EFFORTS AND REALLY HELPING- ARE ARE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS IT SEEMS- HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE CONSCIOUSLY MOVE FORWARD WITH OPENING ANOTHER DEPARTMENT THAT STILL WILL LACK- THE LEADERSHIP NECESSARY TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL WHILE ALSO THINKING ABOUT. WHAT'S NEEDED AND IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY FUNDING AND PROVIDING RESOURCES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE COMPLICATIONS MOVING FORWARD THOSE ARE JUST IDEAS THAT I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF. HOW DO WE LAY OUT THE PROPER FOUNDATION NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE DEPARTMENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL VERSUS CREATING MORE. OF MORE OF THE BUREAUCRATIC TYPE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH NO ONE KNOWS WHERE TO GO AND THERE'S NO- NO ONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE TRANSPARENCY PIECES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE DEPARTMENTS. SO DOES SOME FINAL SOMEFINAL THOUGHTS BUT IF NO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS I'M SORRY DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT. THIS IS MY CABLE WITH THE TV I JUST THOUGHT PERHAPS I COULD ADD A COUPLE COMMENTS- IF WHAT I WAS HEARING WAS A LOT OF STRUGGLE REGARDING THE LOGISTICS FOR THIS ALIGNMENT. AND WHAT I WANTED TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT HAPHAZARD WERE RESPECTFULLY FOLLOWING PREVIOUS EXAMPLES UTILIZING THE CUP OPS MANUAL FOR STANDING UP A NEW ENTITY. I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING NOW IS. PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING IN THAT. WE ARE CURRENTLY IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A DECENTRALIZED TYPE OF PROCESS TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW IN A TRANSITION. WHAT WE'RE UTILIZING THESE WORK GROUPS WE HAVE A SERIES OF VERY DETAILED WORK GROUPS. AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ARE PUSHING A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND LOOKING AT. AND WHAT TIM WAS POINTING OUT IS WHEN WE GET. THE BILL LANGUAGE APPROVED AND WE COULD STAND UP THAT THE APPOINTMENTS WOULD TAKE PLACE AND THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE OF. A PERSONNEL. GUARDING TRANSITION. BUT I THINK WHAT WERE HIT STRUGGLE WITH IS WHY TAKING. NOW I THINK WHAT WAS MISSING FROM THE CONVERSATION. IS THIS DECENTRALIZED.PROCESS UTILIZING WORK GROUPS WHICH IS FALLING BACK UP OFF. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER CABLE I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEN ESPECIALLY AMID THE PANDEMIC IS A CONVERSATION AROUND. LEADERSHIP AND A CONVERSATION OF DIRECTORS AND STAFF THAT ARE IN IT T WIN FOR THE LONG TERM. THESE ARE NOT POSITIONS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN LIGHTLY IN TERMS OF JUST BEING HERE FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS OF A YEAR SO THIS IS. THIS REQUIRES A AND LONG TERM STRATEGY IN A LONG TERM GAIN. AND SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW THE DEPARTMENT WILL FUNCTION. AND HOW WE GET TO THE WIN THAT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY ASSIST COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE IN. URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I WE'RE GONNA METALLURGIC WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT A ISSUE AREA THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER FOR LABOR LAW IMPLEMENTATION AND INTERPRETATION WORKLOAD OUR PANELISTS TODAY INCLUDE- MARK- POLLUTANT WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY MISTER CHAZ ALAMO IN LA- AND MISTER JIMENEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LET'S BEGIN MISTER.

THAT ARE ENFORCED ACROSS SEVERAL AND- BISPECIFIC PROPOSAL. SEEKS ADDITIONAL PERMANENT RESOURCES AT WITHIN THE LABOR AGENCY LEGAL UNIT TO FOCUS ON THOSE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES. WITH THOSE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE OUR PUBLIC OUTREACH AND EDUCATION SO THOSE INCLUDE ON SENDING. A FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS OTHER PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MATERIAL OUTREACH MATERIAL EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL FOR THE PUBLIC- ANOTHER IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITY IS THE TRAINING THAT WE DO INTERNALLY FOR NOT ONLY OUR DEPARTMENTS BUT THE INDEPENDENT BOARDS THAT ARE WITHIN THE LABOR AGENCIES SUPPORTING OUR ALE JAY'S. IN UNDERSTANDING THE LAWS THAT ARE PASSED AND ALSO- BE IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH APPLICATION OF THE- YOU LAWS WERE EXISTING LAWS THAT ARE PASSED ON INCLUDING FOR REGULATIONS- ADVICE LETTERS ON ADVISORY RULINGS OPINION LETTERS AND SO FOR- LABOR AGENCY IDENTIFIED THIS NEED- WHEN I FIRST CAME ON BOARD IN TWENTY NINETEEN WITH OUR IMPLEMENTATION. EIGHTY FIVE- AND ALTHOUGH WE DID STEM FROM THE WORK THAT WE DID WITH EIGHTY FIVE WITH OUR UNITS- THE NEED CONTINUES- AS WE HAVE SEEN THROUGH THE PANDEMIC- WITH VARIOUS ACROSS. DEPARTMENTAL EFFORT. I'M ALSO AFTERWARDS WITHIN THE- SO AGAIN THAT IS A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED AND- HOLD GOING AND STOP THEIR ALL RIGHT FOR. MY OTHER PANELISTS TO KIND OF ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT THANK YOU FOR CONSIDER.

CHANGES CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOU ARE REQUESTING PERMANENT FUNDING INSTEAD OF LIMITED TERM. ABSOLUTELY METAL CHAIR SO- THIS ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT PERTAINS TO AB FIVE ON. YOUR THE WORK AB FIVE APPS YOU KNOW WAS WHERE THE STARTED IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO SEE WHERE. WE NEED TO COULD NEEDED TO COORDINATE AND REVIEW- AND WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENTS- WITHIN LABOUR REDUCING THE UNITS WITHIN LABOUR AGENCY. TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW LAW AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES THAT CAME FORTH WITH AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN. HOWEVER THE GENERAL WORK IN TERMS OF- INSURING THAT OUR AGENCY IS SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE ON LEGAL MATTERS- IS IT SOMETHING THAT IS AN IS AN ONGOING EIGHT- EIGHTY FIVE WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT- BUT LIKE I SAID. YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE WITH THE PANDEMIC- AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE ISSUES PERTAINING TO FOR INSTANCE THE EMERGENCY TEMPORARY STANDARD- OTHER ITEMS OUT THERE- FOR INSTANCE WITH A SUPPLEMENTAL FEED SICK LEAVE AS IT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR. WHERE WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON ISSUES- THAT OUR CROSS AGENCY- DIET- EXTEND BEYOND AB FIVE SO IT IS NOT JUST- A TEMPORARY NEEDED AS AN ONGOING NEED. FOR US TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MITIGATING ARE RISKIER AGENCY AND NOT TIME AND MAKING SURE. THAT ALL OF US ARE SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE.

CONVERSATION THAT THE POINT IN STAFF THE GENERAL REGARDING OF WHICH- THAT. CAL OSHA HAS HAD IN RECRUITING- INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS AT THIS POINT- GIVEN SUCH DEMAND FOR THESE POSITIONS AND THE LOW SUPPLY- IF IT MAY PUT THE LEGISLATURE IN A POSITION TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE- FOR THE SALARY- AUGMENTATIONS OR OR OR DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO- ALLOW CAL OSHA TO CONTINUE TO HIRE- INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST DURING THE PANDEMIC- WHEN THERE'S BEEN SUCH A SHORTAGE.

AND SAFETY ENGINEERS- AS WE WERE ASKING FOR AUGMENTATION INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT HAS MOVED AWAY FROM THE USE OF THAT CLASS TO DO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS DUE TO- THERE BEING- A LACK OF CLARITY BETWEEN THE- INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST CLASSIFICATION AND THE SAFETY ENGINEER SO WE FOUND THAT ALL OUR INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS WERE MOVING INTO ANOTHER CLASSIFICATION- BUT TO BE ABLE TO REACH YOU KNOW TAKE TO REACH THAT HIGHER LEVEL SALARY. SO WHILE WE- THIS IS OUR FIRST- REQUEST FOR AUGMENTATION FOR THE INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST CLASSIFICATIONS SO IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE YET TO ASK OUR CONTROL AGENCY KELLY CHARTER TO PURSUE A GEOGRAPHIC- K.

SURE LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION- DEBT COLLECTOR LICENSING AND REGULATION OUR PANELISTS INCLUDE- APRIL ELEVENTH FOR THE DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION MISTER DREW A SADDAM BURKE WITH THE ALLELES OFFICE AND CHARLENE MEN AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LET'S BEGIN MISTER- MISS LEVIN SORRY THERE. I AM IN GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRWOMAN OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS APRIL ELEVENTH AND THE CHIEF OF FISCAL MANAGEMENT OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. WE ARE REQUESTING AN INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION FROM THE FINANCIAL PROTECTION FUND AND FORTY FOUR POSITIONS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. GRADUALLY INCREASING TO FIFTY FIVE POSITIONS AND TEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS BY FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. TO IMPLEMENT THE SB NINE AWAIT DEBT COLLECTION LICENSING ACT. AND WITH THOSE RESOURCES OUR DEPARTMENT WILL PROTECT CONSUMERS. CREATE TRANSPARENCY IN THE DEBT COLLECTOR INDUSTRY BY LICENSING EXAMINING AND REGULATING DEBT COLLECTORS AND BY ENFORCING THOSE PROVISIONS BEST BE NINE AWAIT. I WITH ME TODAY I HAVE BETTY BARNHART ARE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. AND JENNIFER ROBERTS THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF OUR LEGAL DIVISION WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OF THIS REQUEST. WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO INTRODUCE OUR BCPS UNDER ITEM NUMBER NINE AT THIS TIME. NO LET'S LET'S FIRST HEAR FROM THE L. A. O. AND APARTMENT OF FINANCE. BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE. MR STARR BURKE. SORT OF BORED ANALYST'S OFFICE PHONE WE FIND THAT THE OVERALL NEED FOR RESOURCES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINE OH EIGHT IS SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTY STRESS IS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT NEEDED TO MAKE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT WOULD NEED FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT HAD TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DEBT COLLECTORS IT WOULD LICENSE IT IS SOON THAT T WOULD NEED TO LICENSE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND BASED ON THE NUMBER THAT ARE IN TEXAS. AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED. TO LICENSE AT LEAST AS MANY. IN ADDITION THE HAD MAKE US. ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT WOULD TAKE TO LICENSE AND OVERSEE TAX COLLECTORS BECAUSE IT'S STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING ITS REGULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE BASED ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THEIR LICENSING EXAMINATION PROCESS. THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATED IT NEEDED SEVENTEEN FINANCIAL INSTITUTION EXAMINERS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCURATE THEN THE OVERALL REQUEST INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF THE REQUEST THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING TO SHIFT FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA. CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAW WHICH WAS FUNDED LAST YEAR- TO BE REASONABLE HOWEVER IT S UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCURATE. ACCORDINGLY WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSED A LIMITED TERM RESOURCES BUT THAT IT REQUIRED TO REPORT. FIRST WERE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT ON THE NUMBER OF DEBT COLLECTORS WHO APPLIED FOR A LICENSE AS OF JANUARY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE LAW REQUIRES THAT COLLECTORS TO APPLY FOR A LICENSE PLATE AND SO WE ASSUME THE VAST MAJORITY WOULD HAVE DONE SO. ON THIS REPORT WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURETO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT BE SEVEN THOUSAND OR SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT MADE WAS. ACCURATE AND TO THE EXTENT IT'S NOT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE IN THE POSITION TO ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES PROVIDED FOR THE DEPARTMENT. IN ITS. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. IN ADDITION WE WRECKED- IN THIS REPORT WE RECKON BEING. TURNED INTO LEGISLATURE BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT AS I SAID A SECOND REPORT THIS REPORT WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO COMPARE THE AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD IT WHAT IS IT AS SOON EACH POSITION WITH EXPERIENCE. WHAT'S THE ACTUAL WORK WOULD THAT BE CONDITIONS DID EXPERIENCE- WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS REPORT READ HE TURNED IN. TODAY LEGISLATURE BY JANUARY TENTH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AS IT WOULD PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE DATA WOULD NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE AMOUNT OF ONGOING RESOURCES THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS IMPLEMENT SP. NINE AWAIT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WHEN THE LIMITED TERM RESOURCES PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WILL. EXPIRE I'M HAPPY. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER MANNING. CHARLIE MANNING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THIS PROPOSAL JUST HONOR IT REITERATE THAT THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS LIMITED TERM RESOURCES THAT WILL EXPIRE JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RE EVALUATE THEIR NEED FOR ONGOING RESOURCES SO LICENSE DOT COLLECTORS AND PROTECT CONSUMERS BY PREVENTING POTENTIAL RISKS FRAUD AND ABUSE. GIVE OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT LET'S GO TO ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SCENE THEN I JUST HAVE A ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO. THE B. C. P. STATES THAT THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION GOT THE SEVEN THOUSAND DEBT COLLECTOR COLLECTOR ESTIMATE FROM THE TEXAS PROGRAM. INDUSTRY HAS TAXES ESTIMATE INCLUDES DUPLICATES. COMPANIES THAT CLOSED AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULDN'T NEED TO REGISTER UNDER SB NINE OH EIGHT. DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE A RESPONSE TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT D. F. P. I.'S ESTIMATE MAY BE INFLATED AND WILL THERE BE A REVISED ESTIMATE. HELLO THIS IS BETSY BARNHART. AND I'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION- OUR ESTIMATE. BOB FOR ESTIMATE WE USE NUMBERS PULLED FROM ACCOUNT OF THE FROM THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU MTV. YEAH AB WERE BASED ON CENSUS DATA CITED IN RECENT FEDERAL RULEMAKING. ON BASED ON THESE NUMBERS WE PULLED OUR LOGIC BECAUSE- IF TEXAS I FROM SEVEN THOUSAND DEBT COLLECTORS. IN CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE AT LEAST AS MANY. WE HAVE RECENTLY RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COLLECTORS AND WE ARE- IN THE IN THE PROCESS OF MEETING WITH THEM IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO. I TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR NUMBERS CAME FROM AND HOW THEY GOT TO IT SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM- WE HAVE CONTACTED SOME OF THEIR RESOURCES AND HAVE HAD NO RESPONSE.
