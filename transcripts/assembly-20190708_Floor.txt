BY OVER THIRTEEN STATES IN JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE US. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC MINISTRATION AND THE U. S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY RECENTLY PROPOSED. UNDER THE PRESENT IN ADMINISTRATION THE SO CALLED SAFE VEHICLE RULE. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO TAKE ACTION THAT WOULD WEAKEN THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA TO ENACT POLICIES THAT ADDRESS. PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CONTINUE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS EMBARKED ON THE POORLY CRAFTED STRATEGY TO ROLL BACK THE PROGRESS CALIFORNIA'S MADE ON CLEAN AIR. DESPITE THE SUPPOSEDLY BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSAL THE CONSEQUENCES OF ADOPTING THIS STANDARD WILL BE DETRIMENTAL. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT TAKING THIS ACTION WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE OIL CONSUMPTION BY APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BARRELS. PER DAY BUT IT IS ESTIMATED TO COST CALIFORNIA THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS DUE TO NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA MUST CLEARLY STATE THAT WE SUPPORT CLEAN AIR AND THE NEED TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE AREA WHERE WE HAVE THE MOST WORK TO DO. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.
