I AM INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:20.313 region:rollup2
WHAT CURRENT FEDERAL LAW WILL

00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:21.881 region:rollup2

ARE ALSO SUMMARIZED IN A REPORT

WHEN CONSIDERING A STATE BASED

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:05.311 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. IN

CALIFORNIA.

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:08.147 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:10.183 region:rollup2
THAT REPORT IS PART OF YOUR

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:12.118 region:rollup2
BRIEFING MATERIALS.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:13.753 region:rollup2
I'M ONE OF THE KEY THEMES I CAME

00:14:12.118 --> 00:14:15.054 region:rollup2
THAT HAS COME OUT OUT OF THE

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:16.989 region:rollup2
HEARING SO FAR IS THAT

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:18.491 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS MADE A LOT QUITE

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.859 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PROGRESS.

00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:21.394 region:rollup2
IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:23.296 region:rollup2
UNINSURED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE

00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:25.365 region:rollup2
LAST FEW YEARS AND REALLY MOVING

00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:27.066 region:rollup2
TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:28.801 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE DOES REMAIN ABOUT

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:30.636 region:rollup2
THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:32.438 region:rollup2
UNINSURED.

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:34.006 region:rollup2
AND ALSO EVEN WITH PROGRESS

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:35.341 region:rollup2
TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE MUCH

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:37.243 region:rollup2
WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE TO

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:37.744 region:rollup2
IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY IMPROVE

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:39.479 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE

00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:41.247 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:42.115 region:rollup2
AND REDUCE FRAGMENTATION AND

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:44.050 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES OF OUR HEALTHCARE

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:45.818 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.553 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY POLICY APPROACHES

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:49.288 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.923 region:rollup2
AND THESE MAY INCLUDE SINGLE

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:52.592 region:rollup2
PAYER A PUBLIC OPTION.

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:54.727 region:rollup2
A POLICY AND OR POLICY

00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:56.229 region:rollup2
APPROACHES A BUILD ON EXISTING

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.930 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICAL OR

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:59.132 region:rollup2
COVER CALIFORNIA.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.833 region:rollup2
I WON'T BE GETTING INTO EACH OF

00:14:59.132 --> 00:15:02.568 region:rollup2
THESE UP POLICY OPTIONS IN

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:04.103 region:rollup2
DETAIL BUT INSTEAD I'LL BE

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:07.607 region:rollup2
RAISING KEY IMPLEMENTATION

00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:08.574 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER.

00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:09.976 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WANT

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:12.311 region:rollup2
TO DO IS JUST CLARIFY SOME

00:15:09.976 --> 00:15:14.347 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGY.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:17.049 region:rollup2
FIRST WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:18.317 region:rollup2
WHEN WE REFER TO SINGLE PAYER.

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:20.219 region:rollup2
AND THE DEFINITION YOU SEE ON

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:21.687 region:rollup2
THIS SLIDE IS ONE THAT WE LAID

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:23.222 region:rollup2
OUT IN THE PAPER AND HAS GENERAL

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:25.158 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS.

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:27.593 region:rollup2
BUT FUNDAMENTALLY SINGLE PAYER

00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:29.228 region:rollup2
IS A SINGLE CENTRALIZED PUBLIC.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.797 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY ORGANIZED MEANS TO

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:32.465 region:rollup2
COLLECT HEALTHCARE DOLLARS AND

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:34.367 region:rollup2
PAY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:36.636 region:rollup2
ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY.

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:38.571 region:rollup2
I HIGHLY THE WORD SINGLE HERE

00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:40.206 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IT DOES APPLY JUST

00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:42.542 region:rollup2
SAT SINGLE AND NOT A MULTIPLE

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:43.876 region:rollup2
PAYER SYSTEM.

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:45.578 region:rollup2
AS ALL OF YOU KNOW WE CURRENTLY

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:47.780 region:rollup2
OPERATE IN A MULTIPLE PAYER

00:15:45.578 --> 00:15:49.348 region:rollup2
SYSTEM INCLUDING MEDICARE

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.983 region:rollup2
MEDICAID I'LL COVER CALIFORNIA

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:52.552 region:rollup2
CALPERS.

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:54.120 region:rollup2
AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE

00:15:52.552 --> 00:15:57.490 region:rollup2
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AND A

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.658 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PRIVATE PAYERS.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.393 region:rollup2
THE NEXT TERM I ONCE YOU DEFINE

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:02.328 region:rollup2
IS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

00:16:00.393 --> 00:16:04.797 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES A NOTION OF SINGLE

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:06.365 region:rollup2
PAYER AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:08.634 region:rollup2
GETS A BIT MUDDLED. BUT IMPORTS

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:10.102 region:rollup2
NO THAT THE IDEA OF SINGLE PAYER

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:12.338 region:rollup2
AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE ARE ARE

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:13.439 region:rollup2
DISTINCT.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:15.208 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS REALLY

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:16.442 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:18.444 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:19.912 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:21.247 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY TALKING ABOUT ALL

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:22.515 region:rollup2
COVERED LIVES AND MAKING SURE

00:16:21.247 --> 00:16:24.584 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ACCESS TO HEALTH

00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:26.452 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IN SOME WAY.

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:28.321 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER IS REALLY TALKING

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:30.556 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PAYMENT SYSTEM WHICH

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:32.091 region:rollup2
USES ONE PUBLICLY ORGANIZED

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:33.993 region:rollup2
CENTRAL MEANS OF PAYING FOR

00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:35.294 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SERVICES.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:37.797 region:rollup2
SO I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS HELPFUL

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:38.865 region:rollup2
TO TEE UP THOSE DEFINITIONS.

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:40.266 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED UNIVERSAL

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:41.934 region:rollup2
COVERAGE CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:43.970 region:rollup2
A VARIETY OF POLICY OPTIONS.

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:44.804 region:rollup2
INCLUDING SINGLE PAYER PUBLIC

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.772 region:rollup2
OPTION OR EXTENDING CURRENT

00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:48.508 region:rollup2
COVERAGE PROGRAMS.

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:50.309 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THESE POLICY OPTIONS

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:51.677 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE BROAD AND EXPANSIVE

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:53.613 region:rollup2
WHILE OTHERS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:55.348 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL.

00:16:53.613 --> 00:16:57.383 region:rollup2
THE ANCHOR MENTAL APPROACHES

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:59.752 region:rollup2
ARE LIKELY TO HAVE FEWER

00:16:57.383 --> 00:17:02.388 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THEN SAY

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:04.857 region:rollup2
BROAD EXPANSIVE APPROACHES LIKE

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:06.659 region:rollup2
SINGLE LIKE SINGLE PAYER.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:08.527 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE IF A

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:09.495 region:rollup2
NEW POLICY APPROACH REQUIRES

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.963 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO CHANGE HEALTHCARE

00:17:09.495 --> 00:17:13.199 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:14.901 region:rollup2
AND.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.401 region:rollup2
IT TO THE TO CHANGE THE HEALTH

00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:18.170 region:rollup2
CARE COVERAGE THAT THEY

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:19.539 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.207 region:rollup2
SO ULTIMATELY ITS SUPPORT FOR

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:22.608 region:rollup2
POLICYMAKERS TO CONSIDER THE

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.476 region:rollup2
TRADE OFFS OF THE POLICY

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:25.244 region:rollup2
APPROACHES.

00:17:23.476 --> 00:17:26.979 region:rollup2
THE COSTS

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:28.548 region:rollup2
THE DISRUPTION THAT MIGHT MIGHT

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:31.918 region:rollup2
ENSUE.

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:33.052 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE THE BENEFITS.

00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:33.853 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.655 region:rollup2
CONSIDER WHAT'S REALLY

00:17:33.853 --> 00:17:37.690 region:rollup2
ACHIEVABLE IN THE SHORT TERM

00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:39.125 region:rollup2
VERSUS A LONGER TERM.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.526 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW.

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:42.094 region:rollup2
NOT EVERY GOALS ACHIEVABLE

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:43.296 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT.

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:44.797 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD SAY IT'S IMPORTANT

00:17:43.296 --> 00:17:46.432 region:rollup2
TO LAY OUT A ROADMAP

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:47.934 region:rollup2
ARTICULATING WHAT THE FINAL

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:49.435 region:rollup2
DESTINATION IS.

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:51.170 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE SINGLE PAYER OR

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:53.773 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER MEANS OF OF ACHIEVING

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:55.174 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL AFFORDABLE COVERAGE.

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:57.176 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO LAYING OUT A

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:58.978 region:rollup2
ROADMAP I'M A BIG PROPONENT.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:18:00.379 region:rollup2
OF CAREFULLY ASSESSING POLICY

00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:02.548 region:rollup2
OPTIONS TO MINIMIZE ANY

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:04.016 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:05.351 region:rollup2
AND TO UNDERSTAND COURSE

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:07.420 region:rollup2
PROJECTED COSTS AND BENEFITS OF

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:08.487 region:rollup2
VARIOUS OPTIONS.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.122 region:rollup2
SO THE I'LL GET INTO THIS A

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:11.691 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LATER MY PRESENTATION

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:17.096 region:rollup2
WHEN I LAY OUT A FRAMEWORK OF

00:18:11.691 --> 00:18:18.431 region:rollup2
COMPARING VARIOUS OPTIONS.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:20.333 region:rollup2
SO I'M GONNA WALK THROUGH A

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:21.901 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF ON IMPORTANT

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:24.904 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS AND I'M

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:26.105 region:rollup2
CALLING FIRST ORDER QUESTIONS.

00:18:24.904 --> 00:18:28.874 region:rollup2
ONE FIRST ORDER QUESTION OF

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:31.043 region:rollup2
COURSES WHO'S IN AND WHO'S OUT.

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:33.946 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD OF THERE

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:35.715 region:rollup2
ARE CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO.

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.549 region:rollup2
WHICH POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA

00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:38.451 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CONSIDERED.

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:41.187 region:rollup2
.

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:43.356 region:rollup2
UNDER A NEW UP PAYMENT MODEL.

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:45.324 region:rollup2
SO WITH EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN EVERY

00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:47.560 region:rollup2
CONSUMER IN CALIFORNIA BE

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:49.095 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN A POLICY PROPOSAL.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.097 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR TALKING

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:52.832 region:rollup2
ABOUT A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM

00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:53.766 region:rollup2
WOULD WE INCLUDE THE SIX MILLION

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:55.701 region:rollup2
MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:57.203 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:58.938 region:rollup2
ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE

00:18:57.203 --> 00:19:00.306 region:rollup2
MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES SO ABOUT

00:18:58.938 --> 00:19:01.841 region:rollup2
TWO MILLION ARE ENROLLED IN

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.742 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:04.276 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS THEY GET COVERAGE

00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:05.845 region:rollup2
THROUGH A HEALTH PLAN.

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:07.613 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE

00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:09.615 region:rollup2
OPTION OF SWITCHING TO A STATE

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:11.283 region:rollup2
BASED SINGLE PAYER OPTION WHILE

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:13.285 region:rollup2
STILL GETTING MEDICARE BENEFITS

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:14.654 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:16.789 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW MEDICARE IS

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:18.190 region:rollup2
A FEDERAL PROGRAM SO CALIFORNIA

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:19.358 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO BE HAVE TO

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.859 region:rollup2
CONSIDER WHETHER THIS IS

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.894 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE FROM A FEDERAL

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:23.162 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:24.697 region:rollup2
SIMILAR SET OF QUESTIONS ARISE

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:26.932 region:rollup2
FOR THE THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE

00:19:24.697 --> 00:19:28.234 region:rollup2
IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:29.769 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS BE

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:31.303 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN A STATE BASED SINGLE

00:19:29.769 --> 00:19:34.106 region:rollup2
PAYER OPTION OR ANOTHER

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:35.107 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE PROPOSAL.

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:36.542 region:rollup2
AND HOW ABOUT INDIVIDUALS

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:39.011 region:rollup2
RECEIVE HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:40.446 region:rollup2
SELF INSURED EMPLOYERS.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.514 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A FEASIBILITY OF MOVING

00:19:40.446 --> 00:19:42.081 region:rollup2
THESE EMPLOYEES AND THEIR

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.316 region:rollup2
DEPENDENTS TO A STATE BASED

00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:45.685 region:rollup2
PROGRAM?

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:47.787 region:rollup2
DOES THE STATE HAVE THE CURRENT

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:49.288 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES AND LEVERS TO MAKE

00:19:47.787 --> 00:19:50.656 region:rollup2
THESE CHANGES. AS I MENTION

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:53.092 region:rollup2
OTHERS SPEAKERS WILL GET INTO

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:54.794 region:rollup2
MEDICARE MEDICARE MEDICAID ALL

00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:56.662 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:58.297 region:rollup2
SECURITY ACT OR ERISA. AND

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:59.932 region:rollup2
FEDERAL WAIVERS AND AUTHORITIES

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:01.067 region:rollup2
IN MUCH MORE DETAIL.

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:02.668 region:rollup2
BUT I DID WANT TO POINT OUT

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:04.103 region:rollup2
POINT THESE OUT AS KEY

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:05.571 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL FIRST ORDER

00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:07.106 region:rollup2
FEASIBILITY QUESTIONS THAT

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:07.573 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED.

00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:09.708 region:rollup2
WHEN THINKING ABOUT A

00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:13.145 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE WIDE REACHING

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:14.947 region:rollup2
POLICIES SUCH A SINGLE PAYER.

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:17.583 region:rollup2
ANOTHER QUESTION IS.

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:19.051 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO DO WITH BENEFITS.

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:21.287 region:rollup2
WHAT BENEFITS WOULD BE COVERED

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:22.488 region:rollup2
UNDER SAY SINGLE PAYER OPTON OR

00:20:21.287 --> 00:20:24.190 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:25.858 region:rollup2
OPTION?

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.960 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY

00:20:25.858 --> 00:20:29.195 region:rollup2
ADOPT ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.929 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE MINIMUM FLOOR

00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:31.630 region:rollup2
THAT'S LAID OUT BY THE

00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:34.233 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.067 region:rollup2
OR WOULD IT BE ON MEDI CAL WOULD

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:37.470 region:rollup2
THE MEDI CAL BENEFITS BE THE

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:38.838 region:rollup2
RIGHT SET OF BENEFITS.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.906 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IT COST FOR THE TOTAL

00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:41.640 region:rollup2
BENEFIT PACKAGE.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:44.043 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT?

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.011 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC BUT BENEFITS SUCH AS

00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:47.446 region:rollup2
DENTAL CARE FOR ADULTS WITHOUT

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:50.116 region:rollup2
BEING CLINTON. HOW ABOUT

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:52.585 region:rollup2
NUTRITIONAL COUNSELING OR NON

00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:54.253 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION?

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:55.588 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHAT ABOUT COST SHARING

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.922 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR BE PAYMENTS AT THE

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.791 region:rollup2
POINT OF SERVICE. AND IF SO HOW

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.792 region:rollup2
MUCH.

00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:01.293 region:rollup2
WOULD EVERYONE BE CHARGES SAME

00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:03.562 region:rollup2
AMOUNT.

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:05.231 region:rollup2
OR WOULD BE BASED ON INCOME.

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:06.465 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE AGAIN BIG BIG

00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:07.566 region:rollup2
PICTURE QUESTIONS THAT WOULD

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:10.136 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED FROM

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:11.237 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION PERSPECTIVE.

00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:12.371 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE THE NEXT BIG

00:21:11.237 --> 00:21:14.573 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS HOW WILL IT BE PAID

00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:16.175 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:18.210 region:rollup2
THERE IS UNCERTAINTY REGARDING

00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:19.345 region:rollup2
WHETHER AND HOW DOLLARS A AND

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.347 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER.

00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:23.749 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A CALIFORNIA RECEIVES

00:21:21.347 --> 00:21:25.618 region:rollup2
THROUGH FEDERAL CHANNELS CAN

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:27.453 region:rollup2
REALLY BE REDISTRIBUTED TO SOME

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:29.488 region:rollup2
KIND OF CENTRALIZED

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:30.556 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BASED FUND.

00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:31.891 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE BIG POLICY

00:21:30.556 --> 00:21:32.625 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE

00:21:31.891 --> 00:21:34.960 region:rollup2
TO BE.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.794 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP AND DISCUSSED WITH

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.863 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:39.298 region:rollup2
AND HUMAN SERVICES.

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:39.865 region:rollup2
A AGAIN TO THE EXTENT THAT SELF

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.867 region:rollup2
INSURED EMPLOYERS ARE IN THE

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:43.602 region:rollup2
MIX.

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:45.604 region:rollup2
RISA WOULD VERY WELL BE A

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:48.908 region:rollup2
CONCERN.

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:51.043 region:rollup2
WAIVERS UNDER THE ACA MEDICARE

00:21:48.908 --> 00:21:52.545 region:rollup2
AND MEDICAID AGAIN MAYBE A PATH

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:54.079 region:rollup2
FOR OBTAINING SOME OF

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:55.447 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE PERMISSIONS FROM THE

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:57.183 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:58.651 region:rollup2
ON AND TO SEE WHETHER CALIFORNIA

00:21:57.183 --> 00:22:01.086 region:rollup2
COULD STILL RECEIVE.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:02.721 region:rollup2
SOME NECESSARY FUNDS FOR FROM

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:04.657 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:05.157 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY THOSE PATS DEPEND ON

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:07.760 region:rollup2
THE SCOPE OF THE POLICY

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:09.328 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.263 region:rollup2
SO ARE SPEAKERS TODAY WILL AGAIN

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:12.598 region:rollup2
FOCUS MORE ONEROUS AND MEDICARE

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:14.200 region:rollup2
MEDICAID AND THE FEDERAL

00:22:12.598 --> 00:22:15.834 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES AND AND WAIVERS IN

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.003 region:rollup2
MORE DETAIL BUT I DID FIND A. T.

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:19.705 region:rollup2
THOSE UP AND THOSE ARE JUST A

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:20.306 region:rollup2
FEDERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:22.241 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALSO STATE

00:22:20.306 --> 00:22:23.242 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS THAT AFFECT HOW

00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:23.542 region:rollup2
THE WEATHER THE PROGRAM WOULD

00:22:23.242 --> 00:22:25.778 region:rollup2
HAVE SAID.

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:27.379 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:28.781 region:rollup2
SO AS YOU ALL VERY WELL KNOWN

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:30.149 region:rollup2
UNLIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:31.750 region:rollup2
STATES CANNOT OPERATE WITH THE

00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:33.686 region:rollup2
BUDGET DEFICIT.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.788 region:rollup2
SO IF THE STATE WERE TO CONSIDER

00:22:33.686 --> 00:22:37.223 region:rollup2
A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY APPROACH

00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:38.958 region:rollup2
SUCH A SINGLE PAYER. IT'S

00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:40.526 region:rollup2
IMPORTED MAKE SURE THERE'S

00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:42.328 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MONEY TO SUPPORT IT.

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:44.897 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT THE REVENUE TRENDS

00:22:42.328 --> 00:22:46.365 region:rollup2
KEEP PACE WILL HEALTHCARE COST

00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:49.001 region:rollup2
TRENDS IS ILLEGITIMATE AND

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:51.737 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN.

00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:53.105 region:rollup2
SO HOT SO HOW WE ARE MAKING SURE

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:55.708 region:rollup2
TO COLLECT ENOUGH FROM YOU TO

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:56.542 region:rollup2
SUPPORT A NEW PROGRAM ISRAELI.

00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:59.278 region:rollup2
ON IS REALLY A FIRST ORDER

00:22:56.542 --> 00:23:01.814 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:22:59.278 --> 00:23:02.514 region:rollup2
ANOTHER A QUESTION HAS TO DO

00:23:01.814 --> 00:23:04.416 region:rollup2
WITH STATE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:05.784 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WHICH WAS

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:07.686 region:rollup2
TOUCHED ON EARLIER BY IN THE

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:08.888 region:rollup2
OPENING REMARKS.

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:10.489 region:rollup2
YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS FROM

00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:12.124 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY

00:23:10.489 --> 00:23:13.692 region:rollup2
CENTER BUT THERE ARE BURGEONING

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:15.928 region:rollup2
RULES REGARDING ALLOCATION OF

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:17.296 region:rollup2
STATE TROUGH FUNDS TO K. THROUGH

00:23:15.928 --> 00:23:18.797 region:rollup2
TWELVE EDUCATION.

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:20.966 region:rollup2
SO THIS MEANS INCREASES TO THE

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:21.400 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUNDS THROUGH TAXATION

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:23.302 region:rollup2
COULD TRIGGER THESE

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.937 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:26.538 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T IMPORTANT FEASIBILITY

00:23:24.937 --> 00:23:28.173 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION WHEN THINKING

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:29.842 region:rollup2
ABOUT ANY PROPOSAL THAT'S

00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:32.011 region:rollup2
RELYING ON.

00:23:29.842 --> 00:23:32.678 region:rollup2
GENERATING ENOUGH TAX REVENUE

00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:37.950 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD THEN AFFECT THE

00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:38.117 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUNDS.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.019 region:rollup2
SO.

00:23:38.117 --> 00:23:41.787 region:rollup2
.

00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:43.923 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO GET INTO NEXT TO

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:45.891 region:rollup2
A SET OF DESIGN QUESTIONS SO WE

00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:47.493 region:rollup2
FIRST HAD FIRST ORDER QUESTIONS

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:48.861 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY ARE IMPORTANT

00:23:47.493 --> 00:23:50.963 region:rollup2
FEASIBILITY QUESTIONS AND NOW

00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:52.364 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING INTO A NEXT LEVEL

00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:54.533 region:rollup2
OF QUESTIONS I. DO HAVE TO DO

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:56.268 region:rollup2
WITH IMPLEMENTATION BUT REALLY

00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:57.069 region:rollup2
ARE FROM A DESIGN PERSPECTIVE.

00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:59.104 region:rollup2
SO IF WE WERE STARTING FROM

00:23:57.069 --> 00:24:01.006 region:rollup2
SCRATCH.

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:03.075 region:rollup2
CIRCUS IN DESIGNING A NEW

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:04.310 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THESE ARE. THEY KEY

00:24:03.075 --> 00:24:05.711 region:rollup2
DESIGN QUESTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.846 region:rollup2
TO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE

00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:08.380 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION PHASE.

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:09.948 region:rollup2
SO STARTING WITH THE FIRST

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.784 region:rollup2
BULLET.

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.284 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD A SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM

00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:13.819 region:rollup2
ARRANGE FOR HEALTH CARE

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.920 region:rollup2
SERVICES?

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:15.821 region:rollup2
WITH THE SYSTEM USE

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.656 region:rollup2
INTERMEDIARIES SUCH AS HELP

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:19.325 region:rollup2
PLANTS.

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:21.527 region:rollup2
OR WOULD PROVIDERS OF BE PAID

00:24:19.325 --> 00:24:23.796 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY THROUGH SOME STATE

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:25.431 region:rollup2
BASED ADMINISTERED ENTITY.

00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:27.232 region:rollup2
ON JUST USE A COVER CALIFORNIA'S

00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:28.667 region:rollup2
AN EXAMPLE SINCE I WAS A PROGRAM

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:29.702 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN MORE

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:31.437 region:rollup2
RECENT YEARS.

00:24:29.702 --> 00:24:33.272 region:rollup2
THEY HAD TO THINK THROUGH THIS

00:24:31.437 --> 00:24:35.407 region:rollup2
AS A DESIGN QUESTION AND THEY

00:24:33.272 --> 00:24:36.875 region:rollup2
DECIDED TO GO AHEAD OF CONTRACT

00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:37.943 region:rollup2
WITH HEALTH PLANS IN THE STATE.

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:39.845 region:rollup2
TO OFFER COVERAGE AND PAY FOR

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:41.747 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SERVICES.

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:43.248 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ONE MODEL HOW YOU

00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:44.416 region:rollup2
ARRANGE TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE

00:24:43.248 --> 00:24:45.718 region:rollup2
SERVICES WHETHER YOU'D USE

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:47.052 region:rollup2
INTERMEDIARIES SUCH AS HEALTH

00:24:45.718 --> 00:24:49.254 region:rollup2
PLANS ARE PAID DIRECT PAY

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:51.623 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS PHYSICIANS DOCTORS.

00:24:49.254 --> 00:24:55.060 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS DIRECTLY IS UP A KEY

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:56.595 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN QUESTION.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.497 region:rollup2
THE SECOND QUESTION IS REGARDING

00:24:56.595 --> 00:25:00.432 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY OF PAYMENT.

00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:01.500 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH SHOULD DOCTORS

00:25:00.432 --> 00:25:02.835 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.903 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS GET PAID FOR THE

00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:06.071 region:rollup2
SERVICES THEY RENDER?

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:09.641 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD YOU SAID THAT PAYMENT

00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:10.909 region:rollup2
AMOUNT TO MAKE SHIRTS ADEQUATE?

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:12.511 region:rollup2
WOULD PAYMENTS BE TIED TO SAY

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:13.879 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN EXISTING FEE

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:15.447 region:rollup2
SCHEDULE SUCH AS THE MEDICARE

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:17.649 region:rollup2
FEE SCHEDULES OR SOME OTHER

00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:18.984 region:rollup2
MECHANISM.

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:20.119 region:rollup2
SENDING THE APPROPRIATE PAYMENT

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:22.354 region:rollup2
AMOUNT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:24.957 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:26.625 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT.

00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:28.694 region:rollup2
AND ONE CONSIDERING PAN POLICIES

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:30.863 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO PRIME TO ENSURE THAT

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:33.065 region:rollup2
PAYMENT POLICIES AND. ENCOURAGE

00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:34.233 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE USE.

00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:35.868 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ALL KNOW FROM A

00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:39.004 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL FEE FOR SERVICE

00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:40.506 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS THAT ON IT JUDICIAL P.

00:25:39.004 --> 00:25:41.040 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICE PAYMENTS REALLY PAY

00:25:40.506 --> 00:25:43.509 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ON A PER SERVICE

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.110 region:rollup2
BASIS.

00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:48.180 region:rollup2
AND THAT PAYMENT SYSTEM TENDS

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:50.315 region:rollup2
TOWARD MORE USE AND MORE VOLUME.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.216 region:rollup2
AND MORE IS NOT NECESSARILY

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:53.052 region:rollup2
BETTER AND CAN DRIVE UP

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:54.053 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE COSTS.

00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:56.054 region:rollup2
SO THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:57.589 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A MOVEMENT BY

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:59.625 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PAYERS AS WELL PRIVATE

00:25:57.589 --> 00:26:02.661 region:rollup2
PAYERS SHIRLEY TYPE PAYMENT TO

00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:04.930 region:rollup2
VALUE. OR QUALITY AND TO ENSURE

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:06.131 region:rollup2
BETTER HEALTH A TO ENCOURAGE

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.565 region:rollup2
RATHER BETTER HEALTH HEALTH

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:09.101 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AND BETTER

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:10.402 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES.

00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:12.204 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO CONTINUE USING

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:13.972 region:rollup2
COVERED CALIFORNIA AS AN EXAMPLE

00:26:12.204 --> 00:26:15.307 region:rollup2
IN THEIR PROCUREMENT PROCESS

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:17.009 region:rollup2
THEY ENCOURAGE ON PAYMENT

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:18.577 region:rollup2
METHODS THAT ARE ALTERNATE

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:20.412 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE FROM FEE FOR SERVICE

00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:24.082 region:rollup2
MODELS. SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:25.551 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE OF PAYERS TO CONSIDER.

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:27.286 region:rollup2
ON VALUE BASED

00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:29.121 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS ON AS PART OF THEIR

00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:31.490 region:rollup2
PROCUREMENT PROCESS.

00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:32.958 region:rollup2
SO THE WAY PAYMENT SYSTEMS ARE

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.527 region:rollup2
DESIGNED IS AN IMPORTANT DESIGN

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:36.962 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION.

00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:38.263 region:rollup2
THE OTHER IS A PROVIDER

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:40.365 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION I ALREADY

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:41.633 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT PAYMENT ADEQUACY

00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:43.202 region:rollup2
IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:44.269 region:rollup2
THAT STE. POSITIONS REALLY

00:26:43.202 --> 00:26:46.805 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE IN THE

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:49.141 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:51.110 region:rollup2
BUT HOW WOULD A. THIS HOW WOULD

00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:53.779 region:rollup2
POSITION PARTICIPATION WORK SAY

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:55.314 region:rollup2
IN A TRUE SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM.

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:56.882 region:rollup2
IF YOU REALLY JUST HAVE A SINGLE

00:26:55.314 --> 00:26:59.718 region:rollup2
PAYER SYSTEM WITH NO WHETHER

00:26:56.882 --> 00:27:01.553 region:rollup2
PAIRS WELL YOU'D HAVE TO INCLUDE

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:03.422 region:rollup2
ALL PHYSICIANS PRACTICING IN THE

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:05.524 region:rollup2
STATE. OTHERWISE HE WOULDN'T BE

00:27:03.422 --> 00:27:06.792 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SEE PATIENTS BECAUSE

00:27:05.524 --> 00:27:08.460 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE NO OTHER PAYERS

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:10.262 region:rollup2
THEORETICALLY.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.431 region:rollup2
SO A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WOULD

00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:14.066 region:rollup2
HAVE TO REALLY ALLOW ANY WILLING

00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:15.734 region:rollup2
PROVIDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:27:14.066 --> 00:27:17.769 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:20.172 region:rollup2
SO THIS RAISES A A KEY QUESTION

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:22.107 region:rollup2
ABOUT QUALITY AND HOW A SINGLES

00:27:20.172 --> 00:27:23.375 region:rollup2
PAYER SYSTEM CURRENTLY MAKE SURE

00:27:22.107 --> 00:27:23.876 region:rollup2
THE PATIENTS ARE REALLY GETTING

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:26.512 region:rollup2
QUALITY CARE. FOR THEIR

00:27:23.876 --> 00:27:28.780 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

00:27:26.512 --> 00:27:29.281 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN JUST TO CONTINUE USING

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.082 region:rollup2
COVERED CALIFORNIA AS AN

00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:31.884 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:33.552 region:rollup2
.

00:27:31.884 --> 00:27:35.354 region:rollup2
COVERED CALIFORNIA DECIDERS OKAY

00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:37.122 region:rollup2
TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHICH

00:27:35.354 --> 00:27:39.091 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS.

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:40.726 region:rollup2
PAGE IN THEIR NETWORKS AS LONG

00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:42.327 region:rollup2
AS THEY'RE SUFFICIENT ACCESS.

00:27:40.726 --> 00:27:43.462 region:rollup2
SO THIS WAS THE DESIGN CHOICE

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:45.898 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MADE AND IT WAS MADE

00:27:43.462 --> 00:27:48.300 region:rollup2
TWO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF HIGH

00:27:45.898 --> 00:27:50.135 region:rollup2
VALUE. NETWORKS OR HIGH QUALITY

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.337 region:rollup2
LOW COST.

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:54.173 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN HEALTH SYSTEMS.

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:55.574 region:rollup2
SO PROVIDER PARTICIPATION AS

00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:57.543 region:rollup2
WELL AS A QUALITY OF CARE

00:27:55.574 --> 00:27:58.310 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROVIDERS IS

00:27:57.543 --> 00:28:01.079 region:rollup2
REALLY AN IMPORTANT DESIGN

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.147 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:04.449 region:rollup2
THE NEXT IS A CONSUMER

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:06.351 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION AND I HAVE.

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:07.853 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON THIS ALREADY THOSE A

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:09.354 region:rollup2
BIG IMPLEMENTATION QUESTION

00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:11.456 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIGURING OUT YOU KNOW

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:12.891 region:rollup2
WHO'S IN AND WHO'S OUT.

00:28:11.456 --> 00:28:14.459 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:15.694 region:rollup2
FROM A SINGLE PAYER APPROACH

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:17.329 region:rollup2
WHICH INCLUDES ALL CALIFORNIA

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:18.430 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS.

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:19.364 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S STILL SOME

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.699 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY QUESTIONS TO SORT

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:22.534 region:rollup2
pOUT.

00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:24.203 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS BEING A

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:26.872 region:rollup2
RESIDENT MEAN.

00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:28.607 region:rollup2
WITH THIS INCLUDE SOMEONE WHO

00:28:26.872 --> 00:28:30.876 region:rollup2
SAY FOR UP WITH.

00:28:28.607 --> 00:28:32.878 region:rollup2
WAS SO IF YOU'RE ON DECIDING

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:33.845 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYONE THAT IS A RESIDENT

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:37.516 region:rollup2
IS INCLUDED.

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:40.185 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE JUST DEFINED RESIDENCY.

00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:41.920 region:rollup2
WOOD ON A PERSON WHO'S. LIVED IN

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:43.555 region:rollup2
THE STATE FOR A FEW MONTHS BE

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.791 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM.

00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:47.492 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN

00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:49.728 region:rollup2
THE STATE OUR LIVES ELSEWHERE?

00:28:47.492 --> 00:28:50.362 region:rollup2
SO USES EXAMPLES OF ELIGIBILITY

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:52.130 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE SORTED

00:28:50.362 --> 00:28:53.665 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.634 region:rollup2
ON ALREADY TOUCHED ON COVERED

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:58.670 region:rollup2
BENEFITS AND SERVICES SO I WILL

00:28:55.634 --> 00:28:59.638 region:rollup2
ON. WON'T REPEAT THAT. I DO WANT

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.640 region:rollup2
TO TOUCH ON GOVERNANCE AND

00:28:59.638 --> 00:29:03.542 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.844 region:rollup2
SETTING UP A SOUND GOVERNANCE

00:29:03.542 --> 00:29:06.979 region:rollup2
MODEL IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:08.380 region:rollup2
US SOUND GOVERNANCE MODEL

00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:10.082 region:rollup2
PROMOTES ACCOUNTABILITY

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.084 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT. AND

00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:13.385 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE BASED DATA DRIVEN

00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:15.220 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTATION AND

00:29:13.385 --> 00:29:17.556 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.224 region:rollup2
IT ALSO ENCOURAGES CONSUMER AND

00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:21.526 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AS

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:22.361 region:rollup2
WELL AS TRANSPARENCY.

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:24.263 region:rollup2
SO IF WE WERE STARTING FROM

00:29:22.361 --> 00:29:26.031 region:rollup2
SCRATCH CONCERNING NEW PROGRAMS

00:29:24.263 --> 00:29:27.165 region:rollup2
SUCH AS SINGLE PAYER. THEN WE

00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:28.700 region:rollup2
NEED TO THINK THROUGH HOW THE

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:29.968 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WOULD BE GOVERNED AND BY

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.536 region:rollup2
WHOM.

00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:32.638 region:rollup2
WOULD THERE BE A NEW BOARD.

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:35.474 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY AN

00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:37.309 region:rollup2
EXISTINGAGENCY OR NEW AGENCY.

00:29:35.474 --> 00:29:39.011 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN JUST USE COVERED

00:29:37.309 --> 00:29:40.212 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA JUST EXAMPLE. OF THE

00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:41.813 region:rollup2
STATE AT THAT POINT WHEN

00:29:40.212 --> 00:29:43.649 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THAT PROGRAM

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:45.817 region:rollup2
DECIDE TO ESTABLISH A NEW BOARD

00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:47.352 region:rollup2
TO OVERSEE THE EXCHANGE AND SET

00:29:45.817 --> 00:29:48.286 region:rollup2
THE DIRECTION FOR THE PROGRAM.

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:51.623 region:rollup2
AGAIN THAT WAS ONE DESIGN CHOICE

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:53.258 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MADE.

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:54.126 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS ALSO

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:55.694 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE HANDLED BY SOME

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:57.329 region:rollup2
ENTITY.

00:29:55.694 --> 00:29:58.730 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO CONSIDER A SINGLE

00:29:57.329 --> 00:30:00.532 region:rollup2
PAYER PROGRAM THAT CENTRALLY

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:02.734 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED WHAT ARE THE

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:04.469 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD. NEED TO BE

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:06.405 region:rollup2
ARRANGED FOR A NEED TO. CONTINUE

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:07.506 region:rollup2
TO OCCUR.

00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:09.574 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:11.076 region:rollup2
ASSED A STATE ADMINISTERED

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:13.278 region:rollup2
AGENCY OR CENTRALLY ADMINISTERED

00:30:11.076 --> 00:30:14.846 region:rollup2
INTERCEDING WOULD HAVE TO.

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:16.114 region:rollup2
PAY DOCTORS

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:17.649 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS AND PROVIDERS FOR

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:18.583 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SERVICES

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:19.985 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO PAY FOR PRESCRIPTION

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:21.019 region:rollup2
DRUGS.

00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:22.287 region:rollup2
IT WOULD NEED TO ENSURE THE

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:23.255 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS ARE ACCURATE AND THE

00:30:22.287 --> 00:30:26.224 region:rollup2
NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR FRAUD AND

00:30:23.255 --> 00:30:28.093 region:rollup2
ABUSE.

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:29.928 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AN ACTUARIAL ANNOUNCES

00:30:28.093 --> 00:30:32.464 region:rollup2
TO ESTIMATE BUDGET IMPACTS WOULD

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:33.832 region:rollup2
ALSO BE NECESSARY.

00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:35.767 region:rollup2
WE'D ALSO NEED THE FUNCTIONS OF

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.334 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS TO TO TO DETERMINE

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:38.837 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE SUFFICIENT

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:40.939 region:rollup2
SUPPLY OF PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:42.274 region:rollup2
CARE SERVICES AND TO ASSESS

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:43.508 region:rollup2
WHETHER PATRONS ARE REALLY

00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:45.377 region:rollup2
GETTING APPROPRIATE CARE WHEN

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:46.978 region:rollup2
THEY NEED IT.

00:30:45.377 --> 00:30:49.181 region:rollup2
MANY OF THESE FUNCTIONS ARE

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:50.148 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED CURRENTLY IN PUBLIC

00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:52.050 region:rollup2
BY MULTIPLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:53.819 region:rollup2
PAYERS.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.886 region:rollup2
SO IN A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:56.588 region:rollup2
THESE FUNCTIONS DON'T

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:58.690 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY GO AWAY BUT THERE'S

00:30:56.588 --> 00:31:00.258 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR REDUCTION OF THAT

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.427 region:rollup2
DUPLICATION ACROSS PAYERS AND

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:03.862 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:05.464 region:rollup2
IN THE TRANSITION HOWEVER THESE

00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:06.865 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE STOOD

00:31:05.464 --> 00:31:09.634 region:rollup2
UP AND SOME CONSCIOUS DELIBERATE

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:10.969 region:rollup2
FASHION.

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:12.871 region:rollup2
SO A LAID OUT ON A LOT OF

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:14.473 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND IT'S

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.540 region:rollup2
QUITE A LOT OF INFORMATION SO I

00:31:14.473 --> 00:31:17.242 region:rollup2
THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.077 region:rollup2
LEAVE YOU WITH SOME KIND OF

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:21.413 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE. DIFFERENT

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:26.385 region:rollup2
FOR PROPOSALS THAT YOU MAY BE

00:31:21.413 --> 00:31:28.820 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:30.989 region:rollup2
SO ON THIS SLIDE HERE IS A A

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:33.725 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED FRAMEWORK.

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:35.894 region:rollup2
ON AND AND WHAT IT DOES IS I YOU

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:37.896 region:rollup2
SEE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. OWN

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:40.332 region:rollup2
I'VE LAID OUT. SUGGEST YOUR

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:42.300 region:rollup2
CRITERIA TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU

00:31:40.332 --> 00:31:44.002 region:rollup2
ARE LOOKING AND EVALUATING BEARS

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.704 region:rollup2
POLICY PROPOSALS.

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:47.939 region:rollup2
SO IN YOU'D BE EVALUATING POLICY

00:31:45.704 --> 00:31:49.508 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS AGAINST THE STATUS QUO

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:51.777 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE NOW. AND AGAINST

00:31:49.508 --> 00:31:53.445 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER.

00:31:51.777 --> 00:31:54.846 region:rollup2
AND OF THESE CRITERIA CHRIS

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:56.748 region:rollup2
COULD BE TWEAKED BASED ON YOUR

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:58.850 region:rollup2
OVERALL POLICY GOALS.

00:31:56.748 --> 00:32:00.218 region:rollup2
SO IT'LL BE HELPFUL JUST TO TAKE

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.987 region:rollup2
A COUPLE MINUTES TO WALK THROUGH

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:03.755 region:rollup2
EACH ONE.

00:32:01.987 --> 00:32:05.056 region:rollup2
A FIRST OF ALL IS COVERAGE HOW

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:07.025 region:rollup2
MANY ADDITIONAL AND INFO

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:08.794 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WERE ARE CURRENTLY

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:11.496 region:rollup2
UNINSURED WOULD GAIN ACCESS TO

00:32:08.794 --> 00:32:12.864 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE.

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:14.132 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND IS SOMETHING WE

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:15.400 region:rollup2
CALL UP IN CALLING A DISRUPTION

00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:17.369 region:rollup2
INDEX

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.970 region:rollup2
HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:20.138 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE SOME KIND OF

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:23.108 region:rollup2
COVERAGE. WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:25.577 region:rollup2
THEIR PLANS.

00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:27.779 region:rollup2
THE THIRD IS SYSTEM WIDE COSTS.

00:32:25.577 --> 00:32:29.681 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A PROJECTED IMPACT ON

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:30.715 region:rollup2
TOTAL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:31.383 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT TOLL HELP

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:33.018 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES OF

00:32:31.383 --> 00:32:34.119 region:rollup2
COURSES?

00:32:33.018 --> 00:32:34.986 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.955 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT IS

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:37.389 region:rollup2
PART OF.

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:39.424 region:rollup2
THE TOTAL HEALTHCARE

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:40.659 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES.

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:42.360 region:rollup2
THE FOR THIS PAYMENT FOR

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:44.529 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SERVICES.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.465 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY OBJECT IMPACTS ON

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:47.732 region:rollup2
THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS FOR

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:50.635 region:rollup2
DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND OTHER

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:51.503 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS IN THE STATE.

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:53.338 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT AVAILABILITY OF

00:32:51.503 --> 00:32:55.540 region:rollup2
SERVICES?

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:57.542 region:rollup2
DOES A POLICY IMPACT ACCESS TO

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.678 region:rollup2
CARE IN ANYWAY WOULD IMPROVE IT

00:32:57.542 --> 00:33:00.912 region:rollup2
HER WOULD EXACERBATE ANY HEALTH

00:32:59.678 --> 00:33:03.148 region:rollup2
CARE ACCESS ISSUES.

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:05.116 region:rollup2
.

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:06.685 region:rollup2
THE NEXUS QUALITY.

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:08.353 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROPOSAL HAVE

00:33:06.685 --> 00:33:10.322 region:rollup2
ANY PROVISIONS RELATED TO SAFETY

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:12.224 region:rollup2
AND QUALITY.

00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:13.492 region:rollup2
WOULD IT ENCOURAGE USE OF

00:33:12.224 --> 00:33:15.060 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE OR PREVENTIVE

00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:17.629 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.364 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE ENCOURAGING USE OF

00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:21.600 region:rollup2
CANCER SCREENINGS AND PREVENTIVE

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:25.370 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT MIGHT PREVENT.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:27.405 region:rollup2
FUTURE HEALTHCARE COSTS.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.774 region:rollup2
HELD UP FINANCIAL BARRIERS.

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:30.275 region:rollup2
SEARCHES CO PAYMENTS OR MONTHLY

00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:32.611 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS IN THE FORM OF

00:33:30.275 --> 00:33:34.412 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS.

00:33:32.611 --> 00:33:36.548 region:rollup2
THOSE COULD POSE REAL BARRIERS

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:39.217 region:rollup2
TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS SO

00:33:36.548 --> 00:33:42.487 region:rollup2
THAT IS CERTAINLY A CRITERIA.

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:44.022 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:46.758 region:rollup2
THE NEXT OR POTENTIAL DOWNSTREAM

00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:47.192 region:rollup2
EFFECTS SUCH AS THOSE.

00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:49.728 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT.

00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:51.496 region:rollup2
AFFECT THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE

00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:54.866 region:rollup2
AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AND

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:56.234 region:rollup2
HELP HER WORKFORCE PIPELINE.

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:58.303 region:rollup2
THE NEXT ONE IS A THAT I'VE

00:33:56.234 --> 00:34:00.672 region:rollup2
LISTED IS INVESTMENTS IN SOCIAL

00:33:58.303 --> 00:34:02.207 region:rollup2
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH CARE.

00:34:00.672 --> 00:34:04.543 region:rollup2
SO THE QUESTION THERE AS DOES A

00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:05.977 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL ENCOURAGE OUR SYSTEM TO

00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:08.113 region:rollup2
REALLY LOOK AT A PERSON AS A

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:09.814 region:rollup2
WHOLE. INCLUDING ALTHOUGH SOCIO

00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:11.416 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:12.550 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND WELL BEING.

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:14.719 region:rollup2
SUCH AS HOUSING AND FOOD

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.121 region:rollup2
SECURITY.

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:18.023 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE LAST ONE IS

00:34:16.121 --> 00:34:19.524 region:rollup2
FEASIBILITY.

00:34:18.023 --> 00:34:21.059 region:rollup2
WHAT IS TRULY FEASIBLE AGAIN

00:34:19.524 --> 00:34:24.329 region:rollup2
FROM A FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE AND

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:25.964 region:rollup2
FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE?

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:27.666 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS OF VISIBILITY CAN

00:34:25.964 --> 00:34:29.234 region:rollup2
WE OBTAIN THE SUFFICIENT DOLLARS

00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:30.602 region:rollup2
AND GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES

00:34:29.234 --> 00:34:32.270 region:rollup2
TO ESTABLISH AND SUSTAIN THE

00:34:30.602 --> 00:34:34.072 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.973 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IS FEASIBLE FROM A

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:41.179 region:rollup2
STATE CONSTITUTION AND THE

00:34:34.973 --> 00:34:43.682 region:rollup2
BUDGETING RULES PURSE.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:45.951 region:rollup2
SO THIS THIS LAST SLIDE HERE IS

00:34:43.682 --> 00:34:47.552 region:rollup2
REALLY INTENDED TO SHOW HOW SUCH

00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:49.521 region:rollup2
A FRAMEWORK CONSISTS COMPLETELY

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:51.423 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICAL HERE. BUT HOW SUCH

00:34:49.521 --> 00:34:53.191 region:rollup2
A FRAMEWORK COULD BE APPLIED.

00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:54.659 region:rollup2
SO I A HYPOTHETICAL OPTION

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:56.027 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE HYPOTHETICAL OPTION

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.595 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO.

00:34:56.027 --> 00:35:00.665 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THIS IS JUST TO SHOW

00:34:57.595 --> 00:35:01.533 region:rollup2
HOW IT GOT THE CRITERIA AND ONCE

00:35:00.665 --> 00:35:03.301 region:rollup2
YOU'VE ANALYZE EACH OF THE

00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:04.536 region:rollup2
OPTIONS HOW THEY FARED AGAINST

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:06.371 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER AND AGAINST THE

00:35:04.536 --> 00:35:08.573 region:rollup2
STATUS QUO.

00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:10.408 region:rollup2
SO WHEN LOOKING AT YOU PROPOSALS

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:11.977 region:rollup2
ANALYSTS COULD TAKE A LOOK AT

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:12.277 region:rollup2
EACH CRITERIA.

00:35:11.977 --> 00:35:14.779 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:16.514 region:rollup2
SEE HOW THEY DID FOR EACH OF

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:18.450 region:rollup2
THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA. IN THIS

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:19.718 region:rollup2
ONE IT LOOKS LIKE HYPOTHETICAL

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.119 region:rollup2
OPTION NUMBER ONE IT MAY

00:35:19.718 --> 00:35:23.121 region:rollup2
INCREASE COVERAGE.

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:24.489 region:rollup2
BY BY A LOT.

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:26.758 region:rollup2
BUT IN MAY BE DIFFICULT TO

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:28.360 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT.

00:35:26.758 --> 00:35:31.129 region:rollup2
DO A FEASIBILITY DUE TO BEARS A

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.998 region:rollup2
FEASIBILITY.

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:33.765 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICAL OPTION TWO MIGHT

00:35:32.998 --> 00:35:35.834 region:rollup2
BE MORE INCREMENTAL IN ITS

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:38.136 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:39.804 region:rollup2
AND MIGHT BE MORE FEASIBLE BUT

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:41.339 region:rollup2
MAY ONLY RESULT IN A SMALL

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:43.108 region:rollup2
INCREASE OF COVERAGE.

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:45.110 region:rollup2
SO THE JUST ONE WAY FOR YOU TO

00:35:43.108 --> 00:35:46.811 region:rollup2
WELL.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.812 region:rollup2
COMPARE VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:50.515 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT BE CONSIDERING IN THE

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:54.252 region:rollup2
NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS.

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:56.054 region:rollup2
SO.

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:56.655 region:rollup2
SERB THEIR OWN LIKE THAT THAT

00:35:56.054 --> 00:35:57.155 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CONCLUDES MY REMARKS

00:35:56.655 --> 00:35:59.157 region:rollup2
SO.

00:35:57.155 --> 00:36:01.960 region:rollup2
.

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:03.728 region:rollup2
YOU TAKE QUESTIONS NOW OR.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.163 region:rollup2
YEAH ACTUALLY AND WE WILL TAKE

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:06.331 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND THEN WE'LL

00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:10.402 region:rollup2
MOVE ON TO OUR THE REST FOR

00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:12.137 region:rollup2
PANEL SO QUESTION. FOR SUSAN.

00:36:10.402 --> 00:36:13.772 region:rollup2
IN MANY OF YOURS YOU'RE

00:36:12.137 --> 00:36:14.973 region:rollup2
COMPARING THE STATUS QUO TO

00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:16.508 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL OPTIONS I WAS

00:36:14.973 --> 00:36:18.376 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT

00:36:16.508 --> 00:36:19.811 region:rollup2
ON THE STATUS QUO.

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:21.913 region:rollup2
AND TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE

00:36:19.811 --> 00:36:23.815 region:rollup2
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES THAT WE

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:25.316 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY FACE TO.

QUITE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:44.702 region:rollup2
LAST FEW YEARS. TO BOMB EXPAND

00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:45.904 region:rollup2

00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:49.107 region:rollup2
SO ON BUT THERE'S STILL DOES

00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:50.175 region:rollup2

00:42:21.806 --> 00:42:24.642 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SO IT'S RELEVANT BECAUSE

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:26.277 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A LATE

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:27.879 region:rollup2
ADDITION I THINK WE COULD AGREE

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:29.447 region:rollup2
NOW AYE AYE I THINK IF I WERE TO

00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:31.149 region:rollup2
CUENTA PHRASE WOULD BE SOMETHING

00:42:29.447 --> 00:42:32.784 region:rollup2
LIKE AMENDED HASTE REPENT AT

00:42:31.149 --> 00:42:35.086 region:rollup2
LEISURE.

00:42:32.784 --> 00:42:36.754 region:rollup2
OKAY WE PUT IT IN THERE WE

00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:37.789 region:rollup2
DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT MEANT

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:40.258 region:rollup2
WE'VE RELIED ON THE SUPREME

00:42:37.789 --> 00:42:40.792 region:rollup2
COURT OKAY TO EXPLAIN TO US AND

00:42:40.258 --> 00:42:41.592 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE THAT'S WHAT THAT

00:42:40.792 --> 00:42:43.528 region:rollup2
MEANT.

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:44.829 region:rollup2
AND IN SOME WAYS AN UNHAPPY

00:42:43.528 --> 00:42:46.431 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S NO

00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:47.598 region:rollup2
SURPRISE THAT THE FORTIETH

00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:48.833 region:rollup2
ANNIVERSARY OF THE REST OF THE

00:42:47.598 --> 00:42:50.234 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE.

00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:51.669 region:rollup2
TO LOOK BACK AT IT AMONG ALL THE

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:53.004 region:rollup2
SORT OF BIGGER RISK GEEKS WAS

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:54.539 region:rollup2
CALLED THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

00:42:53.004 --> 00:42:55.606 region:rollup2
INCOME SECURITY ACT OF NINETEEN

00:42:54.539 --> 00:42:57.742 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FOUR WHAT WERE THEY

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:58.976 region:rollup2
THINKING.

00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:59.610 region:rollup2
AND I PERSONALLY THOUGHT I WISH

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:01.446 region:rollup2
I HAD NAMED IT.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.780 region:rollup2
IT'S BRILLIANT.

00:43:01.446 --> 00:43:04.415 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING I DON'T

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.550 region:rollup2
THINK WE'LL EVER KNOW?

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:08.719 region:rollup2
OKAY WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS WHAT

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:09.921 region:rollup2
THE SUPREME COURT.

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:11.088 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT AND THEN FINALLY

00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:12.957 region:rollup2
RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO HEALTH

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:14.559 region:rollup2
POLICY BECAUSE IT PREMIUMS THE

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:15.493 region:rollup2
WORD OF THE DAY ALRIGHT STATE

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:16.894 region:rollup2
LAWS THAT RELATE TO EMPLOYEE

00:43:15.493 --> 00:43:18.696 region:rollup2
PLANS.

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:20.998 region:rollup2
PUSHES ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:22.633 region:rollup2
ROOM IS THE WAY I DESCRIBE IT.

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:24.302 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT AIR IN THE ROOM TO

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:26.204 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU'RE GOING

00:43:24.302 --> 00:43:29.207 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO ARGUE YOU LEFT OF

00:43:26.204 --> 00:43:31.108 region:rollup2
SOME HERE. OKAY HOW BY NOT

00:43:29.207 --> 00:43:32.276 region:rollup2
SUCKING IT ALL OUT TO CONGRESS.

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:34.145 region:rollup2
FEDERAL PREEMPTION IS THE

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:35.613 region:rollup2
DOCTRINE MUCH BIGGER THAN EVER

00:43:34.145 --> 00:43:36.314 region:rollup2
SET A MUCH BIGGER THAN HEALTH

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:37.782 region:rollup2
CARE THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE

00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:38.649 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS THAT ASSERTS THAT WHEN

00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:39.917 region:rollup2
A STATE LAW AND FEDERAL LAW

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:42.687 region:rollup2
CONFLICT.

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:45.189 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW DISPLACES OR PREEMPT

00:43:42.687 --> 00:43:46.657 region:rollup2
STATE LAW ARM ESSENTIALLY A

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:48.893 region:rollup2
UNDER THE SUPERCENTER SUPREMACY

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:49.794 region:rollup2
CLAUSE OF THE.

00:43:48.893 --> 00:43:53.131 region:rollup2
XIN WHICH IS OF COURSE.

00:43:49.794 --> 00:43:54.899 region:rollup2
ARTICLE SIX SECTION TWO. IT

00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:55.733 region:rollup2
MOVE EVEREST IS ADMINISTERED.

00:43:54.899 --> 00:43:57.135 region:rollup2
IT'S DIVISION IT'S

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:59.003 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIONS DIVIDED AMONG

00:43:57.135 --> 00:44:00.371 region:rollup2
THREE ENTITIES AND THE FEDERAL

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:01.806 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THE UNITED STATES

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:03.474 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. THE

00:44:01.806 --> 00:44:04.575 region:rollup2
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.943 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE PENSION BENEFIT

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:07.578 region:rollup2
GUARANTY.

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:08.946 region:rollup2
OPERATION IF YOU THINK OF IT AS

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:10.715 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY AS A GOAL WHICH WAS TO

00:44:08.946 --> 00:44:12.917 region:rollup2
CREATE WHAT.

00:44:10.715 --> 00:44:13.818 region:rollup2
FIDUCIARY DUTIES IN PENSION PLAN

00:44:12.917 --> 00:44:15.286 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS JUST THINK

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:17.021 region:rollup2
STUDEBAKER PEOPLE AND YOU'LL

00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:19.056 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHY WHAT WAS THE

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:20.424 region:rollup2
PURPOSE RIGHT TO CREATE. RULES

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:21.626 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:23.528 region:rollup2
PENSION PLANS THAT WOULD

00:44:21.626 --> 00:44:25.630 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARD THOSE WHO BELIEVE

00:44:23.528 --> 00:44:27.198 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES AND. ACCORDING TO

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:28.766 region:rollup2
PLAN DOCUMENTS WERE VESTED TO

00:44:27.198 --> 00:44:30.401 region:rollup2
PROTECT THEIR RETIREMENT INCOME.

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:32.103 region:rollup2
OKAY IT MAKES SENSE THEN THAT IT

00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:34.105 region:rollup2
WOULD FIT THIS WAY. BUT THAT

00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:35.473 region:rollup2
ALSO WERE HEALTH.

00:44:34.105 --> 00:44:37.441 region:rollup2
BENEFITS DIDN'T AS WELL THEY'RE

00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:38.676 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED AN EMPLOYEE WELFARE.

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:41.979 region:rollup2
BENEFIT.

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:44.682 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT.

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:47.184 region:rollup2
SO I GOT A LOT OF CALLS ON THE

00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:48.252 region:rollup2
DAY AFTER A OF THE AFFORDABLE

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.520 region:rollup2
CARE ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW SO

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:51.455 region:rollup2
SUNLAND MARCH TWENTY THIRD

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.823 region:rollup2
TWENTY TEN FROM PEOPLE WHO KNOW

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:53.758 region:rollup2
THAT I'M. A SOMETHING OF

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:55.226 region:rollup2
INTEREST SO.

00:44:53.758 --> 00:44:57.295 region:rollup2
GEEK IN THE CITY

00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:59.397 region:rollup2
DID WE JUST PEEL APPEAL REPEAL

00:44:57.295 --> 00:45:02.133 region:rollup2
LARISSA AND WHAT NOT.

00:44:59.397 --> 00:45:03.234 region:rollup2
OKAY WE AMENDED IT IN SOME WAYS

00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:05.503 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY CREATED SOME

00:45:03.234 --> 00:45:07.204 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS TO IT IN OTHER WAYS.

00:45:05.503 --> 00:45:09.073 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY SPECIFIC

00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:10.841 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS IN THE AFFORDABLE

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:12.843 region:rollup2
CARE ACT WHICH FILE.

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:14.812 region:rollup2
TOURISTS AND I THOUGHT THAT'S

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:15.746 region:rollup2
WORTH POINTING OUT TO YOU OKAY

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:18.049 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT'S DESCRIBED AS IN

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:19.784 region:rollup2
ON EASY RELATIONSHIP WE COULD

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:21.252 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THE TWO STATUTES MIGHT.

00:45:19.784 --> 00:45:21.852 region:rollup2
BE SEEN AS NOT PERFECTLY DOVE

00:45:21.252 --> 00:45:23.521 region:rollup2
TAILING MIGHT BE A WAY TO PUT

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:24.255 region:rollup2
IT.

00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:25.923 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:26.991 region:rollup2
.

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:27.558 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AS A

00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:28.492 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL MATTER THAT MEANS

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:31.963 region:rollup2
THAT?

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:33.331 region:rollup2
?

00:45:31.963 --> 00:45:34.265 region:rollup2
IT DID AMENDED SO THAT THERE ARE

00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:35.366 region:rollup2
RULES RELATING TO THE

00:45:34.265 --> 00:45:36.701 region:rollup2
PROHIBITION OF PRE EXISTING

00:45:35.366 --> 00:45:38.669 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS THAT PROHIBIT

00:45:36.701 --> 00:45:40.037 region:rollup2
LIFETIME AND ANNUAL DOLLAR

00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:42.139 region:rollup2
LIMITS FOR ESSENTIAL BENEFITS.

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:43.774 region:rollup2
SOME RESTRAINTS ON RECISIONS OF

00:45:42.139 --> 00:45:45.743 region:rollup2
INSURANCE POLICIES ON RECORD

00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:46.844 region:rollup2
COVERED STANDARDS BUT THERE ARE

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:48.446 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS THAT WERE NOT

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:50.781 region:rollup2
CHANGED THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE

00:45:48.446 --> 00:45:51.682 region:rollup2
EVER WONDERED WHY. IT MATTERS

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:53.317 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:54.452 region:rollup2
INTEREST QUALIFY PLAN WHETHER OR

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:56.187 region:rollup2
NOT THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL

00:45:54.452 --> 00:45:57.655 region:rollup2
BENEFIT STANDARD APPLIES THAT'S

00:45:56.187 --> 00:46:00.458 region:rollup2
A RISK.

00:45:57.655 --> 00:46:02.093 region:rollup2
pORISSA.

00:46:00.458 --> 00:46:03.327 region:rollup2
DIVIDING ALL EMPLOYER SPONSORED

00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:06.030 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE.

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:08.332 region:rollup2
WHO SETS?

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:09.333 region:rollup2
OKAY THOSE THAT WILL RECEIVE THE

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:10.768 region:rollup2
MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFITS

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:11.369 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT AND THOSE THAT ARE

00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:13.204 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF IT AND EXEMPT FROM

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:14.071 region:rollup2
IT.

00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:15.439 region:rollup2
SO THE MOST RELEVANT QUESTION

00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:16.741 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ASK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:18.009 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THE MINIMUM

00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:19.377 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL BENEFIT STANDARD IS.

00:46:18.009 --> 00:46:21.412 region:rollup2
US INTERESTS.

00:46:19.377 --> 00:46:22.980 region:rollup2
QUALIFY PLAN.

00:46:21.412 --> 00:46:24.682 region:rollup2
THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFIT

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.884 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS DO NOT APPLY.

00:46:24.682 --> 00:46:27.818 region:rollup2
TO A SELF FUNDED PLAN SO I

00:46:26.884 --> 00:46:28.919 region:rollup2
THOUGHT MAYBE I SHOULD SAY A

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:29.687 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. WHAT THAT

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:32.123 region:rollup2
IS?

00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:32.857 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:34.225 region:rollup2
<u><c.red>N THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE</c></u>

00:46:32.857 --> 00:46:36.560 region:rollup2

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.330 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN SO OFTEN HEARD SURE

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:40.531 region:rollup2
TO HEALTH PLAN IS WHERE AN

UNSURE WHERE AN EMPLOYER

BUT INCREASINGLY CREEPING DOWN

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:47.738 region:rollup2
WHEN I SAY VERY LARGE I MEAN

FIVE HUNDRED PLUS. EMPLOYEES.

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:50.341 region:rollup2
BUT CREEPING DOWN.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.008 region:rollup2
FOR REASONS WILL DISCUSS IN A

00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:53.711 region:rollup2
SECOND.

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:55.646 region:rollup2
ASSUME RISK.

00:46:53.711 --> 00:46:58.115 region:rollup2
THEY FUNCTION AS THEIR OWN

00:46:58.115 --> 00:47:00.985 region:rollup2
WHEN I SAY ASSUME RISK THAT

00:46:59.984 --> 00:47:02.553 region:rollup2
MEANS THEY HAVEN'T SHIFTED THE

00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:04.555 region:rollup2
RISK. OKAY OF EXTRAORDINARY

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:05.990 region:rollup2

00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:12.863 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY THEY KIND OF

00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:18.669 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW

00:47:17.902 --> 00:47:20.137 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT OF BECAUSE THE

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:21.639 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN

00:47:20.137 --> 00:47:23.040 region:rollup2
SOME THOUGHT. TO CHANGING

00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:24.208 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW AND STOP LOSS

YOU'RE FUNCTIONING AS YOUR OWN

RISK PARA. EMPLOYEES DO NOT KNOW

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:43.427 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS HOW IT IS WORKING

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:45.196 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU HIRE AN INSURANCE

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:47.398 region:rollup2
COMPANY JUST TO ADMINISTER THE

00:47:45.196 --> 00:47:48.299 region:rollup2
BENEFITS AND THEY PUT OUT A CARD

00:47:47.398 --> 00:47:49.967 region:rollup2
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE AN

INSURANCE CARD. THAT THEY WOULD

00:47:49.967 --> 00:47:52.269 region:rollup2

00:47:55.473 --> 00:47:59.710 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES HAVE NO IDEA.

00:47:57.675 --> 00:48:01.312 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE AND

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.346 region:rollup2

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:06.484 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS THAT SO

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:07.017 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER COULD CHOOSE TO

ALRIGHT HOW DO YOU FIND OUT YOU

00:50:39.904 --> 00:50:42.673 region:rollup2
FIND IT BECAUSE THE RULES ARE

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:44.542 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ABOUT APPEALS ON

00:50:42.673 --> 00:50:45.843 region:rollup2

00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:48.078 region:rollup2
LOTS AND LOTS OF WAYS YOU FIND

00:50:45.843 --> 00:50:49.480 region:rollup2

KNOW BELIEVE ME YOU FIND OUT.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.616 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SO WHERE DOES THAT MEAN

00:50:50.514 --> 00:50:54.084 region:rollup2
PRACTICALLY IT MEANS THAT THERE

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:55.719 region:rollup2
ARE VAST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO

00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:56.186 region:rollup2

ALRIGHT.

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:06.363 region:rollup2
AYE AND THE REASON WHY THAT

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:07.765 region:rollup2
MATTERS IS THAT SO TO TRY AND

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:08.232 region:rollup2
BRING THEM BACK INSIDE THE TENT

00:51:07.765 --> 00:51:10.000 region:rollup2
YOU SEE WOULD REQUIRE

00:51:08.232 --> 00:51:10.868 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.337 region:rollup2
FLYING FULL IN THE FACE.

00:51:10.868 --> 00:51:14.471 region:rollup2
OVERSEE.

00:51:13.337 --> 00:51:16.607 region:rollup2
NOW THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DID

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:18.609 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO BREAK UP THIS IDEA OF

00:51:16.607 --> 00:51:20.311 region:rollup2
WE SORT. EMPLOYER SPONSORED

00:51:18.609 --> 00:51:21.845 region:rollup2
HEALTH COVERAGE BY THESE TWO

00:51:20.311 --> 00:51:22.880 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT'S WHY I GAVE YOU THE

EXAMPLE OF THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.216 region:rollup2
BENEFITS IT BALLOTS TO.

00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:27.851 region:rollup2
OKAY SO IT'S NOT LIKE WILL THE

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:29.119 region:rollup2
ACA BROKE THAT SO MAYBE WE COULD

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:30.754 region:rollup2
BREAK THAT TO KNOW IT DOESN'T

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:33.123 region:rollup2
BREAK IT AT ALL.

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:34.825 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS THE ACA IS

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:36.927 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL STE COVERAGE.

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:38.595 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:40.798 region:rollup2
OKAY BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:42.266 region:rollup2
OF RATIONALITY TO THIS DIVISION

00:51:40.798 --> 00:51:43.701 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT BUT THERE'S A LONG

00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:45.002 region:rollup2
HISTORY.

00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:47.871 region:rollup2

OTHER PURPOSES.

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:51.342 region:rollup2
SO I AYE THOUGHT MIGHT BE

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:53.344 region:rollup2
INTERESTING TO LOOKS.

00:51:51.342 --> 00:51:55.179 region:rollup2

OKAY.

00:53:03.147 --> 00:53:06.116 region:rollup2

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:09.253 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE BILLS THE CONTAX

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:10.320 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS YOU CAN

00:53:09.253 --> 00:53:12.256 region:rollup2
PROVIDE REMEDIES FOR INJURIES

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.257 region:rollup2
WHEN THE HEALTH PLAN CONTROLS

00:53:12.256 --> 00:53:14.992 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CARE DELIVERY IN OTHER

00:53:13.257 --> 00:53:16.360 region:rollup2
WORDS. IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY

00:53:14.992 --> 00:53:17.361 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL MED MAL CASE YOU

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.163 region:rollup2
NEED TO UNDERSTAND ONE ARREST

00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:19.863 region:rollup2
WAS FIRST PASSED SOME PEOPLE

00:53:19.163 --> 00:53:21.632 region:rollup2
THOUGHT IT FEDERAL EYES MET

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:23.801 region:rollup2
BALBOA. NEVER ACTUALLY HAD TO BE

00:53:21.632 --> 00:53:25.202 region:rollup2
LITIGATION OVER TO TO JUST TAKE

00:53:23.801 --> 00:53:28.038 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY TO HAVE DIFFERENT

00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:29.339 region:rollup2
STANDARDS FOR MEN. YOU KNOW UP

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:31.275 region:rollup2
UP TO CONGRESS ALRIGHT.

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:32.376 region:rollup2
SO WHAT CAN'T THE STATE'S DO.

00:53:31.275 --> 00:53:34.545 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN

00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:35.546 region:rollup2
THE WHAT NOT TO WEAR RIGHT.

00:53:34.545 --> 00:53:37.181 region:rollup2
CAN'T THEY DO THEY CAN'T

00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:38.682 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY REGULATE PRIVATE

00:53:37.181 --> 00:53:42.186 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH PLANS

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:43.754 region:rollup2
I CANNOT SAY. YOU. MUST DO THIS

00:53:42.186 --> 00:53:45.155 region:rollup2
WITHIN YOUR PLAN ALRIGHT THE

00:53:43.754 --> 00:53:47.024 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF A RISK IS WHAT TO

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:48.692 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZE.

00:53:47.024 --> 00:53:49.727 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO I CALL IT IT'S NOT

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:51.895 region:rollup2
REALLY AWARE BUT SORT OF

00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:53.997 region:rollup2
FIDUCIARY AYE. RIGHT IT'S ABOUT

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:55.532 region:rollup2
HAVING QUALITY ADMINISTRATION

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:57.000 region:rollup2
RIGHT MANDATE THAT YOU CANNOT

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:58.669 region:rollup2
MANDATE THE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.404 region:rollup2
OFFER A PAY FOR INSURANCE.

00:53:58.669 --> 00:54:01.805 region:rollup2
RIGHT PROBABLY CAN'T TAX PRIVATE

00:54:00.404 --> 00:54:04.074 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER PRO CLEAR SPONSORED

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:05.509 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS THEMSELVES.

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:06.009 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN'T REGULATE SELF

00:54:05.509 --> 00:54:07.377 region:rollup2
INSURED PRIVATE EMPLOYEE

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:11.315 region:rollup2

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:13.984 region:rollup2
OR FINANCIAL SOLVENCY.

00:54:11.315 --> 00:54:15.786 region:rollup2
SO EVERYTHING AFTER THIS IS SO

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:17.421 region:rollup2
WE ARE ON THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT

00:54:15.786 --> 00:54:19.256 region:rollup2
THE STATE MAY AND MAY NOT TO IS

00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:21.358 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ANYONE WISHES TO.

00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:22.993 region:rollup2
RIGHT IT'S ALL ABOUT ANALOGIZE

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:24.661 region:rollup2
DOING RIGHT IS ANALOGY MONGERING

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:25.963 region:rollup2
RIGHT IS IT MORE LIKE THIS ISN'T

00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:27.564 region:rollup2
MORE LIKE THAT AND THAT'S WHERE

00:54:25.963 --> 00:54:29.266 region:rollup2
THE CASE LOGOS AND THAT'S

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:29.833 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WHAT THE SUPREME COURT

00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:30.634 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZES IN DOING IN THIS

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:32.903 region:rollup2
AREA.

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:34.171 region:rollup2
OKAY SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT A

00:54:32.903 --> 00:54:36.140 region:rollup2
RECIPROCAL MERGE DIRECT

00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:37.141 region:rollup2
REGULATION OF EMPLOYER SUPPLANTS

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.742 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALLOWS THE STATE

00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:39.610 region:rollup2
REGULATION OF THE INSURANCE

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:41.678 region:rollup2
CARRIERS THAT PROVIDE THE

COVERAGE.

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:45.315 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT IT ALLOWS REGULATION OF

00:54:43.881 --> 00:54:46.917 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COVERS BUT CANNOT

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:49.186 region:rollup2
REACH INTO THE PLANT ITSELF. AS

00:54:46.917 --> 00:54:51.088 region:rollup2
IF TO SAY YOU ARE AN INSURANCE

00:54:49.186 --> 00:54:53.357 region:rollup2

YOU DON'T GET TO DEMINT

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:02.733 region:rollup2
AS THE WRESTLING WHICH GOES YOU

00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:05.169 region:rollup2
DON'T GET TO DEMAND AN INSURANCE

00:55:02.733 --> 00:55:07.437 region:rollup2
COMPANY. WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHAT

00:55:05.169 --> 00:55:09.940 region:rollup2
I THINK UNDER MANY PROPOSALS.

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:11.575 region:rollup2
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE WHAT SOME

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.844 region:rollup2

EMPLOYER PAIR PLAY HEALTH CARE

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:27.791 region:rollup2

ADMINISTER SELF INSURED PLANS

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:32.162 region:rollup2
REMEMBER I SAID ONE AETNA IN ITS

00:55:30.494 --> 00:55:33.497 region:rollup2
GUYS OF NOT BEING IMMATURE BUT

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:34.765 region:rollup2
JUST BEING AN ADMINISTRATOR.

00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:36.900 region:rollup2
RUNS A PLANNING GIVES AT MY

00:55:34.765 --> 00:55:39.269 region:rollup2

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:40.337 region:rollup2
PROVIDER OF WHAT WE GONNA CALL

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:42.005 region:rollup2

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:46.176 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ASSURE

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:48.111 region:rollup2

OR VIRTUAL FORMS ARE ALRIGHT AND

00:55:52.316 --> 00:55:55.852 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE WHERE THE

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:57.287 region:rollup2
FIGHT GOES FROM THERE.

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:58.789 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SO WHAT ABOUT STATE

00:56:13.237 --> 00:56:16.673 region:rollup2

00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:18.408 region:rollup2
DEPEND ON ITS CHARACTERISTICS ON

HOW FAR YOU COULD PUSH IT TO ONE

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:21.011 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THE LINE OF THE OTHER.

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:22.779 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE MEANING

00:56:21.011 --> 00:56:24.448 region:rollup2
PUTTING IT ON WHAT THE

00:56:24.448 --> 00:56:27.050 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO AVOID CHALLENGE THIS

00:56:25.782 --> 00:56:27.885 region:rollup2
IS MY OPINION IF IT MAKES NO

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:30.687 region:rollup2

EVEN TAXES YOU SHOULD KNOW

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:50.274 region:rollup2

JUST GUESSING

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:23.900 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE THE COURT WAS THE

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:27.170 region:rollup2
AS ANYONE WOULD BE GREAT BUT

00:58:25.569 --> 00:58:28.872 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MIGHT BE THAT HOME SO

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:30.340 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T JUST SORT OF KIND OF

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:31.108 region:rollup2
MONKEY WITH IT TO KINDA.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.709 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

00:58:31.108 --> 00:58:33.810 region:rollup2
KILL SMALL ENTREPRENEURIAL

00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:35.345 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES WERE TRYING TO YOU

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:36.813 region:rollup2
KNOW TARGET WHAT WE SEE IS THE

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:38.548 region:rollup2
BIGGEST OFFENDERS ARE THINGS

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:39.950 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS. SO EVEN THEN THAT WAS

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:41.318 region:rollup2
REALLY A TAX

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:43.820 region:rollup2
BUT ATTACKS FOUND NOT TO BE

00:58:41.318 --> 00:58:44.721 region:rollup2
NEUTRAL RIGHT.

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.390 region:rollup2
SO ONCE I GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:47.824 region:rollup2
CASES BEYOND FIEDLER IF YOU WANT

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.693 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT THEM THE GOLDEN

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:51.762 region:rollup2
GATE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION LOTS

00:58:49.693 --> 00:58:54.197 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE ASK ME SOON. WILL OR

00:58:51.762 --> 00:58:55.098 region:rollup2
HOW DID THAT WORK. WITH THE REST

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:56.533 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND I YOU KNOW IN A

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:57.634 region:rollup2
LITTLE UP ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS

00:58:56.533 --> 00:58:59.002 region:rollup2
HOW DID THAT WORK RIGHT WITH A

00:58:57.634 --> 00:59:00.637 region:rollup2
HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. AND YOU

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:03.340 region:rollup2
SHOULD KNOW LITERACY ISSUES WERE

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:04.841 region:rollup2
RAISED VERY EARLY. AS CHALLENGES

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.577 region:rollup2
TO HELP THE CALABASAS AND

00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:08.979 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO EVEN THE WAY IT WAS

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:10.847 region:rollup2
DESIGNED A FEW RUPAUL.

00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:11.982 region:rollup2
AN EXTRAORDINARY FACT SITUATION

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:12.616 region:rollup2
WHERE THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO

00:59:11.982 --> 00:59:14.418 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY CREATES AN INSURANCE

00:59:12.616 --> 00:59:15.585 region:rollup2
COMPANY.

00:59:14.418 --> 00:59:17.020 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK IT'S EVERY

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:19.322 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITY IN THE UNITED

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.757 region:rollup2
STATES OR EVEN IN CALIFORNIA

00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:21.992 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD SAY. I'VE GOT IT I'VE

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:23.360 region:rollup2
GOT A WAY AROUND IT IS A LET'S

00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:24.895 region:rollup2
CREATE AN INSURANCE COMPANY

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.129 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE DELIVERS

00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:27.531 region:rollup2
NEVER MIND JUST FINANCES BECAUSE

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:29.733 region:rollup2
RIGHT IT'S VISIBLE HEALTHCARE

00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:30.934 region:rollup2
DELIVERY. BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY

00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:33.770 region:rollup2
THE SERVE DOUBLE DIMENSION TO

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:35.939 region:rollup2
THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT SAVED IT.

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:37.374 region:rollup2
FORMER US AT THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

00:59:35.939 --> 00:59:39.376 region:rollup2
OKAY WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT SAID

00:59:37.374 --> 00:59:41.144 region:rollup2
LISTEN THEY GAVE EMPLOYERS IN

00:59:39.376 --> 00:59:42.846 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA A CHOICE AND ONE OF

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:44.548 region:rollup2
THEM WAS NOT TRAINED MONKEY WITH

00:59:42.846 --> 00:59:46.116 region:rollup2
YOUR WRISTS A PLAN YOU COULD

00:59:44.548 --> 00:59:47.517 region:rollup2
JUST GO AHEAD AND BE AND.

00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:49.920 region:rollup2
HEALTHY SAN FRANCISCO ORAL TO

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:51.354 region:rollup2
COULD PAY YOU KNOW SOME AMOUNT

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.556 region:rollup2
BUT WE WEREN'T TRYING OF IT IS

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:54.157 region:rollup2
THE IDEA THAT IT WASN'T AN ALL

00:59:52.556 --> 00:59:55.492 region:rollup2
OR NOTHING SEEMED PRETTY

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:57.360 region:rollup2
POWERFUL AND THAT IT WASN'T ALL

00:59:55.492 --> 00:59:59.229 region:rollup2
TRYING TO REACH YOUR HANDS IN

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.729 region:rollup2
UNTIL PEOPLE. ALL TELL YOU HOW

00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.298 region:rollup2
TO ORGANIZE YOUR PLAN.

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:02.299 region:rollup2
NOW JUST

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:04.067 region:rollup2
IF IT'S HELPFUL TO PEOPLE

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:05.268 region:rollup2
REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE SO THIS

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.503 region:rollup2
CASE WHICH BEHIND CIRCUIT

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.871 region:rollup2
OPINION CAME DOWN IN TWO

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:09.239 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHT IF IT'S USEFUL

01:00:07.871 --> 01:00:11.208 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE TO REMEMBER.

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:12.242 region:rollup2
BUT THEN IT WAS A PETITION FOR

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:15.011 region:rollup2
REHEARING ON FONG.

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:15.745 region:rollup2
.

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:17.647 region:rollup2
SPUR ABOUT THAT.

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:19.049 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS DENIED SO IT TOOK

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:20.016 region:rollup2
AWHILE BUT EVENTUALLY A PETITION

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.418 region:rollup2
FOR CERT AT THE SUPREME COURT

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:22.252 region:rollup2
WAS FILED AND THAT WOULD HAVE

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:23.720 region:rollup2
BEEN LIKE JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:25.055 region:rollup2
NINE. THOSE OF YOU KNOW WHO

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.256 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THE SUPREME COURT NO THAT

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:28.058 region:rollup2
THEY WOULDN'T CONSIDER TAKING

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:28.592 region:rollup2
THAT UP UNTIL THE FALL OF TWO

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:30.494 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TEN AND THEN THEY

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:31.061 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T ACTUALLY HEAR IT UNTIL

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:32.929 region:rollup2
THE SPRING. BREAK AND GUESS

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:35.665 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:38.535 region:rollup2
BEFORE KERRICK PATH.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:40.003 region:rollup2
SO IT UNFIT IN ESSENCE BECAME.

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:41.872 region:rollup2
MOOD NOW THE SUPREME COURT

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:44.274 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SAY THAT THAT DOESN'T

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:46.243 region:rollup2
SAY HOW WE WOULD RULED THIS WAY

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:47.611 region:rollup2
THEY JUST CLIMB. OKAY SO YOU

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:49.312 region:rollup2
CANNOT READ A GREAT DEAL INTO A

01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:49.913 region:rollup2
BOOK BUT WE DO KNOW IS THAT SO

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.214 region:rollup2
IT NEVER WENT BEYOND THE NINTH

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:52.415 region:rollup2
CIRCUIT.

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:54.417 region:rollup2
OKAY THIS IS A THEORY FROM THE

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:55.752 region:rollup2
NINTH CIRCUIT RIGHT THAT THIS

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:56.520 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE PERMISSIBLE THAT IT'S

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.888 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE I'VE PUT.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.955 region:rollup2
WELL THIS MIGHT BE WHERE THE

01:00:57.888 --> 01:01:00.390 region:rollup2
STORY CONTINUES.

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:01.758 region:rollup2
RIGHT THIS IS A QUESTION WORTH

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:03.860 region:rollup2
ASKING.

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:05.295 region:rollup2
AND WORTH HAVING ANSWERED.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.364 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK IT WOULD TAKE A

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:08.265 region:rollup2
TRIP TO THE SUPREME COURT. A

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:10.467 region:rollup2
ROUNDTRIP TICKET IS OFTEN

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:11.134 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED TO MY STUDENTS.

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:12.536 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS IT UP TO GO UP THERE

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:14.171 region:rollup2
AND ASK FOR CERTIORARI IT'S

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:14.804 region:rollup2
DISCRETIONARY JURISDICTION AND

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:15.105 region:rollup2
THEN YOU'D HAVE TO GET THERE ON

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:17.407 region:rollup2
THE MERITS.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:18.742 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:20.710 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT AN INEXPENSIVE

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:22.212 region:rollup2
TICKET.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:23.780 region:rollup2
ARE INTELLECTUALLY FASCINATING

01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:25.515 region:rollup2
STROKING

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:28.451 region:rollup2
BUT MY HUSBAND'S MONEY. I WOULD

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:32.989 region:rollup2
LIKE TO PRESENT THIS ISSUE.

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:34.090 region:rollup2
IT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED.

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:35.492 region:rollup2
MY FATHER WANTED TO SAY A LITTLE

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:37.027 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT GO BABY OF LIBERTY

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:38.261 region:rollup2
MUTUAL ANOTHER COUPLE CASES ARE

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:39.529 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY RECENT OF THE SUPREME

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:40.697 region:rollup2
COURT WHAT THE CONTROLS ABOUT A

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.898 region:rollup2
RECESSION GO BAY I HAD SOME

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:42.732 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:44.334 region:rollup2
FROM PEOPLE.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:45.302 region:rollup2
ASKING ME WHAT COULD WE DO

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:47.537 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE COULD WE DO IT

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:49.306 region:rollup2
ALL PAYERS CLAIMS DATABASE KIND

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:51.541 region:rollup2
OF ATTEMPT AT REFORM COOLEY MAKE

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:52.742 region:rollup2
A MOVE TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:55.045 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:57.047 region:rollup2
THIS CASE NO THE VERMONT STATUTE

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:59.216 region:rollup2
FOR ALL PAYERS CLAIMS DATABASE.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.784 region:rollup2
STRUCK DOWN ON THE GROUNDS OF A

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:02.752 region:rollup2
RECIPIENT XIN.

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:04.554 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY ON JUSTICE KENNEDY

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:06.323 region:rollup2
WHO WROTE THE OPINION WAS NOT

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.991 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT THIS WAS THE

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:13.196 region:rollup2
STATE OF VERMONT TRYING TO DO

01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:16.166 region:rollup2
SOMETHING IT WASN'T DUPLICATION.

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:17.968 region:rollup2
DIDN'T REQUIRE DUPLICATION.

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:18.568 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT ANY ALSO WASN'T

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:19.336 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT THE STATE OF

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:21.771 region:rollup2
VERMONT WAS TRYING TO DO

01:02:19.336 --> 01:02:23.006 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT SEVENTEEN OTHER

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:24.007 region:rollup2
STATES WE TRY TO DO A DIFFERENT

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:24.908 region:rollup2
WAY SO. IT WASN'T.

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.376 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT WASN'T TRUE SO

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:28.912 region:rollup2
WASN'T ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:30.113 region:rollup2
IT WAS JUST.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:34.851 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT LABOR COULD DO

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:35.785 region:rollup2
THIS IF THEY WANTED TO.

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:38.321 region:rollup2
SO YOU SEE HOW STRONG THE

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:40.657 region:rollup2
PREEMPTION IS.

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:41.858 region:rollup2
EVEN JUST THE OPTION OF DOING IT

01:02:40.657 --> 01:02:44.027 region:rollup2
SUCKED THE AIR OUT OF THE ROOM

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:45.395 region:rollup2
FOR VERMONT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:47.497 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK SEVENTEEN STATES

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:51.067 region:rollup2
HAVE PASSED.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:52.435 region:rollup2
IN ONE FORM ANOTHER A KIND OF AU

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.969 region:rollup2
PAIRS CLAIM DATABASE OF

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.738 region:rollup2
PHARMACEUTICALS DIFFERENT

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.238 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:56.406 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT AND THEY'RE ALL

01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:59.242 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING.

01:02:56.406 --> 01:03:01.444 region:rollup2
OKAY ON ON THIS SAME GROUNDS

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:02.012 region:rollup2
ONES TO SAY JUST BOUGHT A COUPLE

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:02.979 region:rollup2
WORDS OF HAVING COMPLETELY

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:04.481 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMED ABOUT TWO VERY

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:06.483 region:rollup2
RECENT CASES AT THE SUPREME

SPONSORED BY RELIGIOUS ORDERS

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:24.401 region:rollup2
THINK A CATHOLIC ORDER. THAT

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:25.368 region:rollup2
SPONSORS A PLAN YOU KNOW FOR TO

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:27.470 region:rollup2

NO IN THE COURSE OF OF MEN ARE

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:33.643 region:rollup2
TWO CASES.

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:35.445 region:rollup2
THE PREMISE AND THEY HAVE NOT

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:36.012 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING FOR ARGUMENT TWO

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:36.813 region:rollup2
SEPARATE CASES WHY DOES THIS

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.580 region:rollup2
MATTER.

TAX LOOKS LIKE.

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:13.596 region:rollup2
APPEAR PLAY OPTION IN THE GUISE

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:15.698 region:rollup2
OF ATTACKS.

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:17.767 region:rollup2
RIGHT MEMBER IN THE MARYLAND

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:19.335 region:rollup2
CASE.

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:20.803 region:rollup2
HE YOU JUST GOTTA PAY A HIGHER

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:22.805 region:rollup2

THEN NO COULD YOU TRY AND ARGUE

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:29.245 region:rollup2

TARGET TO DO THAT WOULD BE THE

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:38.021 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT DO I THINK THIS WOULD

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.255 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE LITIGATED IF THEY

01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:40.657 region:rollup2

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:42.458 region:rollup2

HAVE TO BE TEST.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:44.727 region:rollup2

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:46.763 region:rollup2
AN ARGUMENT.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.664 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:49.098 region:rollup2

ANTS AND STAY IN THAT SPEAKS

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:04.714 region:rollup2
THE GREAT QUESTION.

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:06.683 region:rollup2
KIND OF ALONG THE LINES

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:08.151 region:rollup2

BECAUSE A BE A CASE OF FIRST

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:17.487 region:rollup2
IMPRESSION I TOLD YOU THIS WAS

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:19.155 region:rollup2
NOT DECIDED.

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:20.923 region:rollup2
RIGHT STUMBLED RIGHT UP TO IT

01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:22.091 region:rollup2
STOPPED. UCAS STUMBLED AROUND A

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:25.094 region:rollup2
FEW TIMES.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:26.396 region:rollup2
AND THAT CAN TAKE A FEW YEARS

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:27.230 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON ALONG THE WAY TO

01:09:26.396 --> 01:09:28.631 region:rollup2
THE GOLDEN GATE RESTAURANT

01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:29.666 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:30.433 region:rollup2
TIME OF ONE AGAINST THEM THE

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.701 region:rollup2
GOLDEN GATE RESTAURANT

REHEARING. DO UNDERSTAND

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:36.372 region:rollup2
PROLONGED EACH PHASE OF IT A

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:38.608 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE NANBAN PRE

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:39.776 region:rollup2
HEARING US DE YOU KNOW. THERE

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:44.013 region:rollup2
ARE MANY PROCEDURAL MOVES TO

01:09:39.776 --> 01:09:44.647 region:rollup2
MADE ALONG THE WAY TO THE

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:45.815 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURTS UNNECESSARILY OR

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.883 region:rollup2
AKA.

01:09:45.815 --> 01:09:48.317 region:rollup2
SO A LOT DEPENDS ON CONDUCT IT

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:49.252 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT EARNERS

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:49.919 region:rollup2
STRATEGY THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW

01:09:49.252 --> 01:09:53.389 region:rollup2
WHAT THOUGH.

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:54.857 region:rollup2
BUT YES IT'S NOT INSTANTANEOUS.

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:56.092 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN KIND OF FOCUS YOU

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:57.660 region:rollup2
YOU GOT MY INTEREST EARLY ON WE

01:09:56.092 --> 01:09:58.461 region:rollup2
GOT THIS.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.729 region:rollup2
FIRST OFF THANK YOU AT THIS

01:09:58.461 --> 01:10:01.564 region:rollup2
POUNDS HOPING TO BE FASCINATING

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:04.233 region:rollup2
I'M GLAD I AM IF I COULD PICK UP

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:06.335 region:rollup2
ANOTHER RESEARCH JUNKIE OF BEEN

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:08.604 region:rollup2
AWARE THE DEATH.

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:11.774 region:rollup2
I'M NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT I'M

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:14.177 region:rollup2
CLOSER THAN I WAS EARLIER.

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:15.244 region:rollup2
WHY?

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:16.379 region:rollup2
FROM MY MOTHER'S WOMB SANTA OF A

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:18.247 region:rollup2
RISK.

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:19.615 region:rollup2
SO I'M AND DO A LITTLE MATH HERE

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:20.583 region:rollup2
AND I'M GOOD AT SMALL MATH SO.

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:22.718 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BASICALLY THREE MILLION

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:25.121 region:rollup2
UNINSURED. WE HAVE THIRTEEN

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:26.689 region:rollup2
MILLION PEOPLE TO MEDICAID OR

01:10:25.121 --> 01:10:27.757 region:rollup2
MEDICARE OUT THERE EXPANSION.

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:29.625 region:rollup2
SO THAT LEAVES TWENTY TWO

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:32.628 region:rollup2
MILLION PEOPLE OUT THERE COVERED

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:33.629 region:rollup2
BY SOME SORT OF PLANS YOU SAID.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:35.631 region:rollup2
FIFTY TO SIXTY PERCENT OF THOSE

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:37.233 region:rollup2
ARE POSSIBLY COVERED BY RISA

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:41.070 region:rollup2
PLANTS IS THAT.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:43.406 region:rollup2
WELL COVERED BY EMPLOYER FUNDED

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.874 region:rollup2
OKAY A HEALTH INSURANCE NOW YOU

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:46.476 region:rollup2
CAN DISCERN THAN YOU BACK THE

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:47.543 region:rollup2
NUMBER OUT FROM THE FORM IRIS

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:49.278 region:rollup2
FORM FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THE

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:50.780 region:rollup2
LAWYER HAS DONE SOME GOOD NUMBER

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.981 region:rollup2
CRUNCHING ON THIS BUT THAT

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.716 region:rollup2
NUMBER IT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE OLD.

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:54.717 region:rollup2
NUMBERS BEEN GOING UP SINCE THE

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:56.619 region:rollup2
PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:58.354 region:rollup2
ACT BECAUSE THE REGULATORY

01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:59.989 region:rollup2
BURDEN HAS BEEN RAISED.

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:01.724 region:rollup2
RIGHT ELIZABETH REACHING DEEPER

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.892 region:rollup2
INTO THE EMPLOYER POPULATION SO

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:03.860 region:rollup2
USED TO BE YOU JUST WOULDN'T SEE

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:04.994 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF THING UNLESS THEY

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.295 region:rollup2
HAD AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED NOW

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:07.463 region:rollup2
IT'S DIPPING LOWER.

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.931 region:rollup2
SO I'M GONNA ASSUME THAT THAT

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:10.166 region:rollup2
NUMBERS AT LEAST THAT'S WHY I'M

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:11.300 region:rollup2
HESITANT TO SAY I KNOW THE

01:11:10.166 --> 01:11:12.935 region:rollup2
NUMBER WILL BE DON'T HAVE TO HIT

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.504 region:rollup2
A BUTTON. BUT SOME BE BACK SO

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:16.072 region:rollup2
THE DATA FROM AYE ARRESTS.

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:17.440 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THEN I

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:19.041 region:rollup2
THE CONCERT EFFECTIVE PROJECT IS

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.643 region:rollup2
GOING UP I WOULD SAY. IT'S

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:21.477 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE NEW NORMAL. IN

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:23.579 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WOULD SAY THE

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:26.082 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS I'M

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:26.682 region:rollup2
GONNA GUESS FOREIGN EMPLOYER

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:27.717 region:rollup2
SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE ARE

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:30.486 region:rollup2
IN.

01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:31.287 region:rollup2
AN EMPLOYER SELF FUNDED PLAN

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.522 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS IT'S EXEMPT FROM

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:34.557 region:rollup2
STATE REGULATION.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:36.926 region:rollup2
UNDER RISA.

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:38.060 region:rollup2
ALREADY STATUS QUO ANTE

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:39.295 region:rollup2
AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT KNOW

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:41.664 region:rollup2
THAT CULTURE SHOCK THIS.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:43.132 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:44.667 region:rollup2
OKAY WE ALWAYS ASSUME ALL THAT

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:45.168 region:rollup2
IS HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.602 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW BUT

01:11:45.168 --> 01:11:48.171 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WE.

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:50.573 region:rollup2
THE ACA DID NOTHING TO THE STAR

01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:52.208 region:rollup2
OF THIS SORTING.

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:53.176 region:rollup2
MECHANISM AND THIS TREATING TO

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:54.544 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT GROUPS VERY

01:11:53.176 --> 01:11:55.778 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY ONE ESSENTIALLY IS

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:57.747 region:rollup2
PROTECTED FROM REGULATION.

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:59.815 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:01.717 region:rollup2
PROTECT ITS THERE'S A BARRIER.

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:04.187 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL THERE.

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:05.121 region:rollup2
SUPERBLY BY THOSE NUMBERS

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:06.489 region:rollup2
ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:08.591 region:rollup2
POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:09.892 region:rollup2
BIG SAID.

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:11.027 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND TO

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:12.528 region:rollup2
AND EXPERTISE ON THIS I MEAN I I

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:13.596 region:rollup2
READ TO LLOYDS REPORTS YOU KNOW

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:15.164 region:rollup2
I READ A CONSULTING FIRMS

01:12:13.596 --> 01:12:16.065 region:rollup2
REPORTS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:18.034 region:rollup2
BUT YES.

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:19.669 region:rollup2
FOR A LONG TIME NOBODY KNEW WHAT

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:20.903 region:rollup2
THESE NUMBERS OR BECAUSE EVEN

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.737 region:rollup2
THE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THIS

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:23.539 region:rollup2
IS OUR HOPE THAT NOW WE HAVE

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:25.441 region:rollup2
THIS. AND AND SO WE CAN KIND OF

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:26.809 region:rollup2
BACK IT OUT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:28.110 region:rollup2
THE TOP SIX

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:30.546 region:rollup2
STATES IN THE COUNTRY COUNTRY

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:32.915 region:rollup2
FOR THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF.

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:33.549 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU BUT IT'S NOT EVEN WHAT

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:35.351 region:rollup2
YOU GONNA BE KNOCKING OF HIS

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:36.719 region:rollup2
RISE ON LIKE NEW YORK'S IN THERE

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.220 region:rollup2
AND VOTE I?

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.955 region:rollup2
BUT ACTUALLY EVEN LIKE I

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:42.058 region:rollup2
BELIEVE.

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:43.159 region:rollup2
INDIANA NEBRASKA IT ITS TENDS TO

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:44.927 region:rollup2
BE STATEMENT THINK OF MEAT

01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:47.163 region:rollup2
PACKING MEAT PROCESSING POULTRY

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:49.398 region:rollup2
PROCESS SIT WITH REALLY LARGE

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:51.200 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS AND THEN IT DRIBBLES.

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:51.767 region:rollup2
DOWN FROM IT WHY WOULD SMALLER

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.034 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS BE WILLING TO TAKE

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:54.470 region:rollup2
THIS RISK

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:56.272 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY TRYING TO.

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:57.540 region:rollup2
AVOID THE REGULATORY BURDEN I

01:12:56.272 --> 01:12:58.674 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THEY

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.842 region:rollup2
CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES OF STOP

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:00.943 region:rollup2
LOSS INSURANCE WHICH IS WHY I

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.777 region:rollup2
THINK THE LEGISLATURE GOT

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:03.145 region:rollup2
INTERESTED AND STOP LOSS

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:05.448 region:rollup2
INSURANCE BECAUSE OF CHANGE THE

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:06.616 region:rollup2
RULES ON. HOW SMALL YOU CAN BE A

01:13:05.448 --> 01:13:08.084 region:rollup2
HOW EARLY YOU CAN ATTACH STOP

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:09.986 region:rollup2
LOSS INSURANCE TO PROTECT YOU

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:12.154 region:rollup2
FROM HAVING? THE ACTUAL SKULL

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:12.989 region:rollup2
FAMILY THEN WE IN SOME WAYS TO

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:15.925 region:rollup2
CREATE INCENTIVES AND

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:17.994 region:rollup2
DISINCENTIVES FOR SELF INSURING.

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:19.829 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND I THINK I DON'T WAS

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:21.030 region:rollup2
ANYBODY'S MOUTH I SUSPECT THAT

01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:22.031 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WE

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.099 region:rollup2
SECOND SAY IN NEW YORK AND

WISCONSIN THERE ON THE RECORD

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:26.435 region:rollup2
THEY WERE CONCERNED SMALLER AND

SMALLER EMPLOYERS. WERE SELF

MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE.

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:48.190 region:rollup2

NO BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE ACA

01:14:27.997 --> 01:14:30.132 region:rollup2
AMENDED SARISSA WHO IN SOME

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.967 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT WAYS THAT IT NEEDS

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:33.402 region:rollup2
TO IN ORDER TO PERFORM SOME OF

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:35.037 region:rollup2
ITS FUNCTIONS ABOUT IT IF YOU

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.971 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THE ACA FROM TEMPLES

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:37.306 region:rollup2
ME UP. IT ALSO TRYING TO

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:38.708 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.142 region:rollup2
ONLY COMING FROM THE GOVERNMENT

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:41.911 region:rollup2
I OFTEN PUT IT THIS WAY. IN

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:43.913 region:rollup2
UNDER RISA THE IMPULSE WAS TO

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:44.413 region:rollup2
LET THE EMPLOYER STANDARDIZE IT

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:46.148 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE MULTI STATE

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:48.050 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS SO THEY COULD HAVE

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:49.652 region:rollup2
CONSISTENCY ACROSS STATES. AND

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:50.920 region:rollup2
UNDER THE ACA TO STANDARDIZE BUT

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.654 region:rollup2
WITH THE GOVERNMENT ALL DEPENDS

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.356 region:rollup2
ON WHO YOU WANT TO HAVE DO THE

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:54.824 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZING BEFORE COME FROM A

01:14:53.356 --> 01:14:56.792 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE FEDERALISM OF THE

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:59.028 region:rollup2
NEED FOR BETTER STANDARDIZATION.

01:14:56.792 --> 01:15:00.229 region:rollup2
SO HAS SOME EXEMPTIONS THAT HAS

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:02.264 region:rollup2
SOME ALTERATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:04.567 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW SO YOU CAN DO THAT

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:04.900 region:rollup2
STATE LAW CANNOT AMEND A RESERVE

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:06.669 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT'S.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:09.238 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF. YOU KNOW.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:11.040 region:rollup2
IT SUPERIORITY FEDERAL STATUTE.

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:12.041 region:rollup2
PUMP IT AND I THE THE BALL POINT

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.275 region:rollup2
A RELIGION TO ME IS THAT YOU

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:14.577 region:rollup2
FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT ACCOUNT

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:16.145 region:rollup2
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:17.980 region:rollup2
AVOID INTEREST CHARGE AGAIN AS

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:19.348 region:rollup2
LONG AS WE DON'T. REFERENCE

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.583 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER SPONSORED OIL WOULDN'T

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.350 region:rollup2
FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT ANYTHING

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:23.586 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:24.553 region:rollup2
ERISA IT GOES TO THE SUIT WELL

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:25.554 region:rollup2
FOR SO MANY GHOST A FEDERAL

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:26.222 region:rollup2
DISTRICT COURT TODAY TELL YOU

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:28.457 region:rollup2
THIS SOMETIMES FILL DISK RECORD

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:31.260 region:rollup2
JUDGES DECIDE THE CASES

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:32.361 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY ON THE SAME FACTS.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.596 region:rollup2
PART THE REASON THIS IS SUCH A

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.563 region:rollup2
GNARLY AREA OF LAW IS THAT WE

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:36.165 region:rollup2
DON'T NECESSARILY EVEN HAVE

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:38.234 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS ON HOW TO INTERPRET

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:39.368 region:rollup2
AND APPLY IT.

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:41.170 region:rollup2
AND IT GOES TO THE SUPREME COURT

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:42.872 region:rollup2
SO FREQUENTLY.

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:44.407 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS SO GNARLY THAT WE

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:45.975 region:rollup2
OFTEN END UP WITH CONFLICTS ON

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:47.243 region:rollup2
THE CIRCUIT LEVEL SO I HAVE NO.

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:48.544 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE I'M SORRY I HOPE I

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:49.512 region:rollup2
DIDN'T PROTRUDE I CITY OF

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:51.047 region:rollup2
COMPANIES YOU COULD MAKE SUCH AN

01:15:49.512 --> 01:15:52.081 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT BUT IF I JUST SHOW YOU

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:53.516 region:rollup2
IT UP KIND OF HOLLOW OPEN

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:54.784 region:rollup2
CRAWLING TO TO MAKE THAT

01:15:53.516 --> 01:15:56.385 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT AND JUST REASONABLE AN

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:58.287 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS MOST

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:59.555 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO AVOID CHALLENGE. IF IT

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:00.489 region:rollup2
MAKES NO REFERENCE TO EMPLOYER

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:02.057 region:rollup2
SPONSORED HEALTH PLANS ARE

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:03.025 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT'S HOW YOU AVOID IT

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:05.561 region:rollup2
DOES MEAN THAT WILL BE

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:06.896 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED EXACTLY GO TO SHOW.

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:09.098 region:rollup2
THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THINGS I

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:11.033 region:rollup2
THINK MAKE YOU LESS AND MORE

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:15.271 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE. SAWS AND SOME

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:16.238 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL ON THINKING THAT WAY

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:19.108 region:rollup2
RIGHT. THEN THEN.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:21.110 region:rollup2
AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SAN

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:23.312 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:26.682 region:rollup2
THE LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY THE GOING

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:27.683 region:rollup2
GET RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION I

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:29.051 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T SEEN A LEGAL MOUSE.

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:31.520 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH ROOM WITH THEIR BE?

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:32.521 region:rollup2
A AROUND WHAT SAN FRANCISCO DID

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.389 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WORDS I'M FAMILIAR WITH

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:34.123 region:rollup2
WHAT SAN FRANCISCO DID WITH THAT

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.124 region:rollup2
PETER PLAY ORDINANCE.

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:36.959 region:rollup2
BUT HAVE THERE BEEN.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:37.726 region:rollup2
LAW REVIEW ARTICLES ARE OTHERS

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:39.295 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH ROOM IS

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:39.895 region:rollup2
THERE BEYOND WHAT SAN FRANCISCO

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:41.530 region:rollup2
DID THAT WOULD AVOID THE PIN

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:42.364 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.299 region:rollup2
I THINK EVERYONE AGREES THAT IF

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:44.567 region:rollup2
YOU THE COURAGE AND THE

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:46.101 region:rollup2

SET UP YOUR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:49.171 region:rollup2
COMPANY COULD PROBABLY IT DIDN'T

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:50.506 region:rollup2
MAKE AS MUCH OR A RUN THAT AT

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:52.108 region:rollup2
THIS GOAL AS THE GOLDEN GATE

01:16:50.506 --> 01:16:53.742 region:rollup2
RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IS.

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:54.376 region:rollup2
HELP THE SAN FRANCISCO DID

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:55.744 region:rollup2
MEMBER THAT DID NOT GO TO THE

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:57.146 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT BUT THAT MIGHT BE

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:57.913 region:rollup2
YOUR STRONGEST I GIVE YOU THE

01:16:57.146 --> 01:16:59.248 region:rollup2
OTHER POINT OF LIGHT AT THE

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:01.016 region:rollup2
OTHER END OF THE FIEDLER CASE

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:01.851 region:rollup2
AMERICA ON THE WALMART CASE.

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:03.252 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN WOULD BE THE

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:04.520 region:rollup2
TRAVELER CASE FROM NINETEEN

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:06.789 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE OR CIVIL YOU MIGHT

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.524 region:rollup2
HAVE A STATUTE. THAT WAS WHAT OF

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:10.326 region:rollup2
GENERAL APPLICATION THAT ONLY

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:13.229 region:rollup2
INCIDENTALLY BURDEN GENEROUS

01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:14.196 region:rollup2
SUPPLANTING OR YOUR SO NO I KNOW

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:16.132 region:rollup2
OF NO LAW REVIEW ARTICLE THAT

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:18.267 region:rollup2
SORT OF. MEDICINE THAT THERE ARE

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:19.802 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN THE

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:21.070 region:rollup2
COUNTRY WHO RIGHT ON THIS. IS

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:22.371 region:rollup2
PETER JACOBSEN.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:24.707 region:rollup2
ATTIC LUCK.

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:26.275 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT BUT I DON'T HIDE IT

THEIR PEOPLE ALWAYS LIKE ME

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:37.753 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PUT THESE PIECES

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:38.721 region:rollup2
TOGETHER LIKE. LIKE A MOSAIC.

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:40.022 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS HAS NOT

01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:40.856 region:rollup2
BEEN RULED ON. LIVES ALL AGREE

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:44.159 region:rollup2
OKAY THIS WOULD BE A CASE OF

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:45.127 region:rollup2
FIRST IMPRESSION.

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:46.228 region:rollup2
AND IN A SENSE WITH THE GORSUCH

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.963 region:rollup2
WELL THEN THE THE NEWLY

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:50.232 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTED COURT WHETHER THEY

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:52.234 region:rollup2
BE MORE OR LESS LIKELY. YOUR WAS

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:53.536 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR WHO.

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.870 region:rollup2
UP IN A COURT WHOEVER HAS A BACK

01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:56.739 region:rollup2
ON AND HIGHLY TECHNICAL

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:57.973 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND

01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:59.241 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED AREA LIKE A RESERVE

01:17:57.973 --> 01:17:59.742 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IF

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:02.578 region:rollup2
ANYBODY HAS IN A RESERVE

01:17:59.742 --> 01:18:03.512 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND.

01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:04.713 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA BE SUPPRESSED KNOW

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.582 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT I ALSO PRACTICE IN

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:07.616 region:rollup2
ANY TRUST. I CAN TELL YOU ON THE

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:08.651 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT HAS A BACKGROUND

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:10.686 region:rollup2
IN ANY TOUGHEST

01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:12.054 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE TEND TO FOR.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:14.023 region:rollup2
OKAY EVEN SOMETIMES ACROSS THE

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:15.891 region:rollup2
POLITICAL SPECTRUM BECAUSE IT'S

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:18.294 region:rollup2
JUST SO COMPLICATED.

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:19.161 region:rollup2
SO I'D LIKE REALLY CAN'T SAY WE

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:20.663 region:rollup2
HAVE A COUPLE OF BUSINESS

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:22.698 region:rollup2
LITIGATORS.

01:18:20.663 --> 01:18:23.766 region:rollup2
ON THERE AND SO YES I THINK

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.333 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:26.101 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO KNOW SOMETHING

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:28.070 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS.

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:29.638 region:rollup2
THAT I CAN'T SAY MORE THAN THAT

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:31.140 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT WE'RE GONNA KNOW WHO

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:32.608 region:rollup2
CARES THE MOST ABOUT RISK BY WHO

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.876 region:rollup2
GETS TO WRITE THE OPINIONS IN

01:18:32.608 --> 01:18:36.445 region:rollup2
THE TWO CASES INVOLVING.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:38.013 region:rollup2
RELIGIOUS PLANTS.

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:39.915 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT I TALKED ABOUT

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:40.749 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WERE GONNA WHO

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:44.353 region:rollup2
STEPS FORWARD TO SAY I WANNA

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:45.187 region:rollup2
WRITE A GNARLY A RECIPIENT.

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:46.789 region:rollup2
IT IMPLICATES THE FIRST SUMMIT

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:48.991 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHO.

01:18:46.789 --> 01:18:52.428 region:rollup2
SO JUSTICE KENNEDY WROTE THE

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:54.063 region:rollup2
OPINION RIGHT AND SO BAKER.

01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:55.664 region:rollup2
THAT TELLS US SOMETHING ARGUES

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:56.665 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN HE WAS A BUSINESS

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:58.734 region:rollup2
LITIGATOR RIGHT IN SACRAMENTO.

01:18:56.665 --> 01:19:00.603 region:rollup2
M..

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:01.570 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS VERY MUCH YOU KNOW

01:19:00.603 --> 01:19:02.972 region:rollup2
KILLING IT TO CAN IN MEANING THE

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:05.207 region:rollup2
ENTRANCES SO I I DON'T WANT TO

01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:06.575 region:rollup2
PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:07.710 region:rollup2
BE IF THIS ONE TO THE RECORD WHO

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:09.511 region:rollup2
WOULD STEP FORWARD TO WRITE YOU

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:11.480 region:rollup2
DO KNOW THAT THE. CHIEF JUSTICE

ASSIGNS THE WRITING.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.452 region:rollup2
SO AND IF HE IF HE IN THIS CASE

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:17.987 region:rollup2
IS IN THE MAJORITY HIS IT CAN'T

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:20.356 region:rollup2
EVEN ASSIGN IT TO HIMSELF.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:21.890 region:rollup2
SO IT'S POSSIBLE.

01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:24.126 region:rollup2

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:26.108 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE TURNING SIXTY FIVE IN

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:28.210 region:rollup2
ROLLING IN PART A AND B. IS

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:29.578 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC IF THEY'RE ALREADY

01:22:29.578 --> 01:22:33.949 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT. THOUGH

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:34.917 region:rollup2
TECHNICALLY PART BE IS VOLUNTARY

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:36.685 region:rollup2
BUT IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT PART

01:22:34.917 --> 01:22:38.620 region:rollup2
BEEP BEEP PARTY COVERAGE THEY

PLAN THAT OFFERS THIS COVERAGE

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:50.332 region:rollup2
IS NOT AUTOMATIC LIKE A AND B.

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:52.067 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:54.036 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF MEDICARE

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:57.139 region:rollup2
ARE FINANCED DIFFERENTLY.

01:22:54.036 --> 01:22:57.973 region:rollup2
PART A LOT IS FUNDED MAINLY BY

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.508 region:rollup2
A TWO POINT NINE PERCENT PAYROLL

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:02.811 region:rollup2
ON EARNINGS THAT.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:04.646 region:rollup2
IS EQUALLY SPLIT BETWEEN

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:06.582 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.449 region:rollup2
AND THIS MONEY IS DEPOSITED INTO

01:23:06.582 --> 01:23:09.418 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL INSURANCE TRUST

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:10.986 region:rollup2
FUND.

01:23:09.418 --> 01:23:12.087 region:rollup2
HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYERS

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.489 region:rollup2
PAY AN ADDITIONAL ZERO POINT

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:15.424 region:rollup2
NINE PERCENT MAYOR MEDICARE

PAYROLL TAX.

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:18.894 region:rollup2
PART B. IS FUNDED BY A GENERAL

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:20.295 region:rollup2
REVENUES FROM THE FEDERAL

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:21.330 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS MOSTLY

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:23.065 region:rollup2
INCOME TAX.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:25.067 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE SAID TO COVER SEVENTY

01:23:23.065 --> 01:23:26.802 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF PROGRAM COSTS

01:23:25.067 --> 01:23:28.704 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR. AND BENEFICIARIES

01:23:26.802 --> 01:23:29.671 region:rollup2
ALSO PAY MONTHLY PREMIUMS WHICH

01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:31.507 region:rollup2
COVER THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:33.342 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:34.543 region:rollup2
HIGHER INCOME BENEFICIARIES PAY

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:35.844 region:rollup2
A HIGHER SHARE OF PROGRAM

01:23:34.543 --> 01:23:37.713 region:rollup2
COSTING RECEIVE A LOWER FEDERAL

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:40.215 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY.

01:23:37.713 --> 01:23:41.984 region:rollup2
PARTY IS FUNDED SIMILAR LEAD TO

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:43.285 region:rollup2
PART BE WITH GENERAL REVENUES

01:23:41.984 --> 01:23:45.521 region:rollup2
COVERING ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:47.689 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF PROGRAM COSTS EACH

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:49.591 region:rollup2
YEAR AND BENEFICIARY PREMIUMS

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:51.593 region:rollup2
AND STATE TRANSFERS COVERING THE

INCOME BENEFICIARIES PAY A

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:57.266 region:rollup2
HIGHER SHARE OF PROGRAM COSTS

FOR PART D. COVERAGE.

01:23:57.266 --> 01:23:59.902 region:rollup2
SO LET ME TRANSLATE THESE

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:01.203 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS AND

01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:03.238 region:rollup2
ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNTS.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:04.740 region:rollup2
FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR PARTS A

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:06.208 region:rollup2
BMD.

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:07.376 region:rollup2
PART SEE IS NOT SHOWN

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.510 region:rollup2
SEPARATELY HERE BECAUSE IT

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:10.412 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE ITS OWN FINANCING

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:11.847 region:rollup2
STREAM.

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:13.882 region:rollup2
SO TOTAL REVENUE TO MEDICARE AND

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:16.151 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS SEVEN HUNDRED

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:18.086 region:rollup2
AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS.

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:19.888 region:rollup2
PART A REVENUE IN TWENTY

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:21.757 region:rollup2

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:23.358 region:rollup2
NINETY ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:24:21.757 --> 01:24:24.760 region:rollup2

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:29.598 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR BILLION

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:31.600 region:rollup2

01:24:29.598 --> 01:24:33.235 region:rollup2
PART BE REVENUE IN TWENTY

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.836 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN WAS THREE HUNDRED AND

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:36.238 region:rollup2

HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX BILLION

01:24:37.606 --> 01:24:40.542 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WAS FROM GENERAL

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:42.077 region:rollup2
REVENUE.

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:43.812 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIESPAID SEVENTY TWO

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:46.915 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN PART B.

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:48.850 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:50.252 region:rollup2
PARDEE REVENUE WAS A HUNDRED AND

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:51.920 region:rollup2
SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:53.088 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN OF WHICH EIGHTY TWO

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.057 region:rollup2
BILLION WAS FROM GENERAL

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:56.191 region:rollup2
REVENUES AND BENEFICIARIES PAID

01:24:55.057 --> 01:24:58.360 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:59.528 region:rollup2
PARTY PREMIUMS.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.496 region:rollup2
SO I KNOW I JUST MENTIONED A LOT

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:03.265 region:rollup2
OF NUMBERS AND YOU MAY REMEMBER

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:05.200 region:rollup2
NOT OF THEM BUT THE POINT I'D

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:07.169 region:rollup2
LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.937 region:rollup2
MEDICARE RECEIVES A SIGNIFICANT

01:25:07.169 --> 01:25:10.739 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:12.874 region:rollup2
FROM PAYROLL TAXES AND GENERAL

01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:14.610 region:rollup2
REVENUES BUT ALSO A NOT

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:15.077 region:rollup2
INSIGNIFICANT PORTION OF FUNDING

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.878 region:rollup2
IS FROM BENEFICIARIES

01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:17.980 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:20.816 region:rollup2
IN THE FORM OF MONTHLY PREMIUM

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:22.651 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS.

01:25:20.816 --> 01:25:24.319 region:rollup2
SO NOW WE FOCUS IN ON THE

SPECIFICS OF MEDICARE WAIVER

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:27.189 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:29.157 region:rollup2
VERY INTERESTED IN.

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:30.959 region:rollup2
SO TITLE EIGHTEEN OF THE SOCIAL

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:33.061 region:rollup2
SECURITY ACT IS HEALTH INSURANCE

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:35.330 region:rollup2
FOR THE AGED AND DISABLED WHICH

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:37.265 region:rollup2
WE KNOW AS MEDICARE.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:39.067 region:rollup2
WHO QUALIFIES FOR THE PROGRAM

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:41.036 region:rollup2
THAT BENEFITS TO WHICH THEY ARE

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:42.738 region:rollup2
ENTITLED THE MONTHLY PREMIUMS

01:25:41.036 --> 01:25:44.072 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE PAY THE COST SHARING

01:25:42.738 --> 01:25:46.975 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS THAT THEY PAY FOR

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:48.844 region:rollup2
SERVICES? HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:51.013 region:rollup2
AND HOW THE PROGRAM IS FINANCED

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:53.815 region:rollup2
ARE ALL GOVERNED BY STATUTE?

01:25:51.013 --> 01:25:55.450 region:rollup2
BUT FEDERAL LAW ALSO PERMITS THE

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:58.186 region:rollup2
SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

TO MEDICARE.

01:26:07.429 --> 01:26:11.133 region:rollup2
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TO SPECIFIC

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:13.602 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FOR THIS

01:26:11.133 --> 01:26:15.170 region:rollup2
TYPE OF WAIVER ACTIVITY.

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:16.672 region:rollup2
ONE IS SECTION FOUR OH TWO OF

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:19.141 region:rollup2
THE SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS

OF NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH.

01:26:19.141 --> 01:26:24.946 region:rollup2
AIMS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:26.181 region:rollup2
AND ECONOMY OF MEDICARE ALLOWING

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:27.449 region:rollup2

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:29.351 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATIONS TO TEST

01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:31.019 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PAYING

01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:32.988 region:rollup2
FOR MEDICARE SERVICES.

OR COVERING OTHER BENEFITS THAT

01:26:32.988 --> 01:26:37.192 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ALREADY PAID FOR.

01:26:35.157 --> 01:26:38.994 region:rollup2
BY MEDICARE.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:41.730 region:rollup2
THE WAIVER AUTHORIZES THE

01:26:38.994 --> 01:26:42.230 region:rollup2
SECRETARY TO WAIVE MEDICARE

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:44.800 region:rollup2

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:46.702 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY OUT

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:50.338 region:rollup2
THE DEMONSTRATION UNDER THE

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:51.707 region:rollup2
SECTION FOUR OH TO AUTHORITY.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:55.110 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:56.745 region:rollup2
SECTION ELEVEN FIFTEEN A

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:58.914 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH A CENTER FOR MEDICARE

01:26:56.745 --> 01:27:00.682 region:rollup2
AND MEDICAID INNOVATION THIS WAS

01:26:58.914 --> 01:27:02.651 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED OR CREATED BY THE

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:04.019 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

01:27:02.651 --> 01:27:05.921 region:rollup2
DOES SENATOR MEDICARE AND

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:07.622 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID INNOVATION

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:09.891 region:rollup2
ALSO KNOWN AS THE INNOVATION

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:11.860 region:rollup2
CENTER OR CMMI. HAS BROAD

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:14.162 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO TEST INNOVATIVE

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:16.298 region:rollup2
MODELS FOR SERVICE DELIVERY AND

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:19.267 region:rollup2
PAYMENT METHODS THAT DECREASE

01:27:16.298 --> 01:27:21.703 region:rollup2
COSTS AND OR IMPROVE.

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:23.872 region:rollup2
OR MAINTAIN QUALITY IN MEDICARE

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:25.307 region:rollup2
MEDICAID AND CHIP.

01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:27.075 region:rollup2
SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN THIS HAS

01:27:25.307 --> 01:27:28.844 region:rollup2
BEEN THE PRIMARY VEHICLE FOR

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:31.079 region:rollup2
TESTING INNOVATIONS AND MEDICARE

01:27:28.844 --> 01:27:33.215 region:rollup2
PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY.

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:34.349 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION CONGRESS CAN ALSO

01:27:33.215 --> 01:27:35.417 region:rollup2
MANDATE.

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:36.418 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC MEDICARE

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:39.187 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGH

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:40.956 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:43.125 region:rollup2
I WANT NOTE THAT THESE MEDICARE

01:27:40.956 --> 01:27:45.627 region:rollup2
WAIVERS AND DEMONSTRATIONS ARE

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:47.162 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM MEDICAID AND ACA

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:49.331 region:rollup2
WAIVERS WHICH CHIQUITA WILL BE

01:27:47.162 --> 01:27:51.533 region:rollup2
TELLING YOU MORE ABOUT SHORTLY.

01:27:49.331 --> 01:27:53.034 region:rollup2
THOSE WAIVERS MAY BE MORE OF A

01:27:51.533 --> 01:27:55.203 region:rollup2
VEHICLE FOR EXPANDING STATE'S

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:57.205 region:rollup2
DISCRETION OVER PROGRAM RULES

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:59.274 region:rollup2
GOVERNING ELIGIBILITY BENEFITS

01:27:57.205 --> 01:28:00.442 region:rollup2
AT CETERA. BUT THIS IS GENERALLY

01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:02.611 region:rollup2
NOT THE CASE

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:05.080 region:rollup2
FOR MEDICARE WAIVERS.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:06.681 region:rollup2
AT UNLIKE MEDICAID AN ACA THERE

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:09.050 region:rollup2
IS REALLY LITTLE PRECEDENT FOR

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:11.253 region:rollup2
STATES TO SEEK BROAD WAIVERS OF

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:12.587 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW RELATED TO MEDICARE

01:28:11.253 --> 01:28:14.589 region:rollup2
IN LARGE PART I THINK BECAUSE

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:15.924 region:rollup2
MEDICARE IS A NATIONAL PROGRAM.

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:16.525 region:rollup2
AND STATES ARE NOT REALLY

01:28:15.924 --> 01:28:20.595 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:22.697 region:rollup2
IT.

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:24.132 region:rollup2
SO AND BECAUSE THE SECTION FOR

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:25.567 region:rollup2
O. TO AUTHORITY HAS REALLY NOT

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:27.903 region:rollup2
BEEN USED

01:28:25.567 --> 01:28:29.704 region:rollup2
IN THE CONTEXT OF A STATE BASED

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:31.673 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. AND THE

01:28:29.704 --> 01:28:34.209 region:rollup2
SECRETARY WAIVER AUTHORITY UNDER

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:36.144 region:rollup2
SECTION ODE TO IS LIMITED TO

01:28:34.209 --> 01:28:37.679 region:rollup2
MEDICARE'S PAYMENT RULES I WANT

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:40.682 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS MORE ON THE INNOVATION

01:28:37.679 --> 01:28:41.883 region:rollup2
CENTER AND WHAT IT DOES.

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:43.652 region:rollup2
SO AS I SAID THE CENTER HAS

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:46.054 region:rollup2
BROAD AUTHORITY TO TEST AND

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:47.856 region:rollup2
DEVELOP NEW PAYMENT AND SERVICE

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:48.657 region:rollup2
DELIVERY MODELS AND MEDICARE AND

01:28:47.856 --> 01:28:50.959 region:rollup2
THIS INCLUDES STATEWIDE

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:52.861 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES.

01:28:50.959 --> 01:28:54.696 region:rollup2
THE INNOVATION CENTER PLAYS AN

01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:57.065 region:rollup2
INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:59.034 region:rollup2
GOING FROM THE IDEA OF A MODEL

01:28:57.065 --> 01:29:00.468 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY TESTING IT.

01:28:59.034 --> 01:29:02.571 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF THIS

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:04.005 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS THAT THE INNOVATION

01:29:02.571 --> 01:29:05.907 region:rollup2
CENTER SOLICITS IDEAS FOR NEW

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:08.243 region:rollup2
MODELS.

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:10.078 region:rollup2
IT REVIEWS SELECTS AND DEVELOPS

01:29:08.243 --> 01:29:11.580 region:rollup2
THE MOST PROMISING MODELS.

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:12.914 region:rollup2
IT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:14.683 region:rollup2
BENCHMARKS.

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:16.218 region:rollup2
TO MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:18.620 region:rollup2
THE MODEL.

01:29:16.218 --> 01:29:19.688 region:rollup2
AND SELECT PARTNERS TO TEST THE

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:22.357 region:rollup2
MODELS TYPICALLY THROUGH A

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:26.094 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE PROCESS.

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:27.395 region:rollup2
THESE MODELS REQUIRE RIGOROUS

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:27.929 region:rollup2
MONITORING TESTING AND

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.931 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:32.267 region:rollup2
THEIR.

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:33.401 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

01:29:32.267 --> 01:29:35.804 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY THESE MODELS HAVE AN

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:37.505 region:rollup2
END DATE ALTHOUGH THE DURATION

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:38.873 region:rollup2
AND THE SCOPE OF THE MODELS CAN

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:41.710 region:rollup2
BE EXPANDED THROUGH A FORMAL

01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:43.111 region:rollup2
RULE MAKING PROCESS. IF THE HHS

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:45.447 region:rollup2
SECRETARY DETERMINES THAT

01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:47.849 region:rollup2
EXPANSION OF THE MODEL WILL

01:29:45.447 --> 01:29:49.351 region:rollup2
REDUCE PROGRAM SPENDING AND BY

01:29:47.849 --> 01:29:51.419 region:rollup2
THAT I MEAN MEDICARE PROGRAM

01:29:49.351 --> 01:29:54.689 region:rollup2
SPENDING SPECIFICALLY. WITHOUT

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:58.460 region:rollup2
REDUCING QUALITY OR WILL IMPROVE

01:29:54.689 --> 01:30:00.829 region:rollup2
QUALITY. INCREASING SPENDING.

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:03.064 region:rollup2
THESE MODELS ARE NOT INITIALLY

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:05.267 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO BE BUDGET NEUTRAL.

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:07.269 region:rollup2
BUT THE MODELS CAN BE TERMINATED

01:30:05.267 --> 01:30:09.704 region:rollup2
OR MODIFIED UNLESS THE HHS

01:30:07.269 --> 01:30:12.073 region:rollup2
SECRETARY DETERMINES THAT A

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:13.708 region:rollup2
MODEL AS MODIFIED. IS EXPECTED

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:15.777 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE QUALITY WITHOUT

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:17.145 region:rollup2
INCREASING SPENDING REDUCE

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:19.681 region:rollup2
SPENDING WITHOUT REDUCING

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:21.549 region:rollup2
QUALITY OR IMPROVE QUALITY AND

01:30:19.681 --> 01:30:23.952 region:rollup2
REDUCE SPENDING.

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:25.954 region:rollup2
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THE CORE

01:30:23.952 --> 01:30:27.989 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF THE INNOVATION CENTER

01:30:25.954 --> 01:30:29.658 region:rollup2
IS TO TEST INNOVATIVE PAYMENT

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:31.860 region:rollup2
AND SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS TO

01:30:29.658 --> 01:30:33.495 region:rollup2
REDUCE PROGRAM EXPENDITURES

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:36.064 region:rollup2
WHILE PRESERVING OR ENHANCING

01:30:33.495 --> 01:30:37.232 region:rollup2
THE QUALITY OF CARE.

01:30:36.064 --> 01:30:39.534 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT

01:30:37.232 --> 01:30:40.936 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES OF INNOVATION MODELS

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:42.270 region:rollup2
THAT THE CENTER CARRIES OUT AND

01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:43.438 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO FOCUS ON

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.173 region:rollup2
THE SPECIFICS OF EACH OF THESE

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:46.541 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES. BUT I DID WANT YOU

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:47.876 region:rollup2
TO SEE THE RANGE OF MODELS THAT

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:49.511 region:rollup2
THE INNOVATION CENTER HAS

01:30:47.876 --> 01:30:50.745 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO TEST.

01:30:49.511 --> 01:30:52.347 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY DOES

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:54.149 region:rollup2
HAVE INITIATIVES UNDERWAY IN

01:30:52.347 --> 01:30:55.250 region:rollup2
SEVERAL OF THESE CATEGORIES.

01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:57.819 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS

01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:59.688 region:rollup2
LAST CATEGORY INNOVATION I IN

01:30:57.819 --> 01:31:01.389 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES TO ACCELERATE. THE

01:30:59.688 --> 01:31:02.457 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF NEW

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:04.526 region:rollup2
PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:05.593 region:rollup2
MODELS.

01:31:04.526 --> 01:31:07.529 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE SEVERAL STATE

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:08.396 region:rollup2
BASED INITIATIVES.

01:31:07.529 --> 01:31:10.065 region:rollup2
THAT INVOLVE MEDICARE

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:12.367 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION ARE BEING

01:31:10.065 --> 01:31:14.269 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED INCLUDING MARYLAND'S

01:31:12.367 --> 01:31:15.303 region:rollup2
ALL PAYER MODEL I KNOW YOU'VE

01:31:14.269 --> 01:31:17.405 region:rollup2
ALREADY HEARD.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:19.007 region:rollup2
AT A PREVIOUS HEARING DETAILS

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:20.475 region:rollup2
ABOUT MARYLAND'S MODEL SO I

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:22.911 region:rollup2
WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT IT

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:24.245 region:rollup2
HERE. BUT ORIGINALLY OUT I WON

01:31:22.911 --> 01:31:26.047 region:rollup2
AND I MENTION A COUPLE POINTS

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:27.349 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT MARYLAND'S MODEL

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:28.817 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY TOOK THE FORM OF A

01:31:27.349 --> 01:31:29.985 region:rollup2
WAIVER ESTABLISHED IN FEDERAL

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:31.486 region:rollup2
LAW.

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:33.154 region:rollup2
UNDER THE ORIGINAL WAIVER

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:34.723 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAYS HOSPITAL RATES

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:36.825 region:rollup2
THAT MEDICARE'S BUT THAT MARILYN

01:31:34.723 --> 01:31:38.793 region:rollup2
STATS NOT THE RATES THAT

01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:40.495 region:rollup2
MEDICARE'S SETS.

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:41.496 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:43.631 region:rollup2
TO EMPHASIZE THAT MARILYN'S

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:45.133 region:rollup2
WEAVER IS UNIQUE.

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:46.835 region:rollup2
AND SOMEWHAT LIMITED IN SCOPE

01:31:45.133 --> 01:31:49.270 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT DOESN'T CHANGE

01:31:46.835 --> 01:31:51.806 region:rollup2
MEDICARE BENEFITS OR ELIGIBILITY

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:53.541 region:rollup2
OR COST SHARING OR FINANCING OR

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:55.310 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING STREAMS ASSOCIATED

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:56.478 region:rollup2
WITH THE MEDICARE TRUST FUNDS.

01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:58.313 region:rollup2
NOR THE UNDERLYING COVERAGE

01:31:56.478 --> 01:31:59.347 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS OF PEOPLE WITH WITH

01:31:58.313 --> 01:32:01.016 region:rollup2
MEDICARE IN THE STATE OF

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:02.484 region:rollup2
MARYLAND.

01:32:01.016 --> 01:32:04.052 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW

01:32:02.484 --> 01:32:06.021 region:rollup2
THAT MARILYN'S ORIGINAL WAIVER

01:32:04.052 --> 01:32:07.522 region:rollup2
IS SHIFTING AWAY FROM THE

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:08.957 region:rollup2
STATUTORY WAIVER THAT THE STATE

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:11.092 region:rollup2
RECEIVED.

01:32:08.957 --> 01:32:11.960 region:rollup2
TO THIS NEW ALL PAYER MODEL

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:13.495 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:16.197 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INNOVATION

01:32:13.495 --> 01:32:16.765 region:rollup2
CENTER. AND HAS VERY SPECIFIC

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:18.967 region:rollup2
MEDICARE SAVINGS TARGETS TO

01:32:16.765 --> 01:32:22.103 region:rollup2
MEET.

01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:23.004 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO CONTINUE.

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:24.305 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT TO CALL YOUR

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:25.840 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO THE STATE

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:27.208 region:rollup2
INNOVATION MODELS.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.210 region:rollup2
WHICH FALLS WITHIN THIS

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:32.113 region:rollup2
CATEGORY WHICH IS WHERE STATES

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:32.881 region:rollup2
CAN DESIGN AND TEST NEW A MULTI

01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:35.283 region:rollup2
PAYER.

01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:37.018 region:rollup2
AT PAYMENT AND DELIVERY MODELS

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:40.321 region:rollup2
WHICH WITH POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:40.789 region:rollup2
CARE AND LOWER COSTS NOT AND TO

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:42.357 region:rollup2
IMPROVE HEALTH SYSTEM

01:32:40.789 --> 01:32:43.892 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE.

01:32:42.357 --> 01:32:45.627 region:rollup2
THIS MODEL HAS BEEN ROLLING OUT

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:47.028 region:rollup2
IN SEVERAL STAGES AND IN FACT

01:32:45.627 --> 01:32:49.397 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DID RECEIVE TWO

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:50.732 region:rollup2
ROUNDS OF FUNDING IN THE DESIGN

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:52.667 region:rollup2
STAGES.

01:32:50.732 --> 01:32:53.968 region:rollup2
OF THIS INITIATIVE.

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:56.438 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THERE ARE ELEVEN

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:58.006 region:rollup2
STATES IN THE TESTING STAGE

01:32:56.438 --> 01:33:00.141 region:rollup2
WITH THE WIDE RANGE OF PROPOSALS

01:32:58.006 --> 01:33:02.777 region:rollup2
BEING TESTED AND THESE STATE

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:04.846 region:rollup2
INNOVATION MODELS ARE BURIED.

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:06.414 region:rollup2
AND ALSO AMBITIOUS.

01:33:04.846 --> 01:33:07.882 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SUMMARIZE

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:09.851 region:rollup2
THEM IN A SENTENCE OR TWO.

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:11.086 region:rollup2
BUT BUT I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL

01:33:09.851 --> 01:33:12.654 region:rollup2
SEVERAL STATES HAVE BUILT THEIR

01:33:11.086 --> 01:33:14.456 region:rollup2
PLANS AROUND PATIENT CENTERED

01:33:12.654 --> 01:33:16.424 region:rollup2
MEDICAL HOMES.

01:33:14.456 --> 01:33:18.626 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING PRIMARY CARE AND

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:19.727 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE.

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:21.129 region:rollup2
EXPANDING HEALTH INFORMATION

01:33:19.727 --> 01:33:23.164 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY EFFORTS LIKE

01:33:21.129 --> 01:33:25.333 region:rollup2
TELEHEALTH. AND MOVING TO VALUE

01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:26.301 region:rollup2
BASED PAYMENTS SHARED SAVINGS

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:29.104 region:rollup2
AND ACCOUNTABLE CARE PAYMENT

01:33:26.301 --> 01:33:30.972 region:rollup2
MODELS.

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:32.474 region:rollup2
CMS HAS SOMEWHAT HOPEFULLY I

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:34.008 region:rollup2
THINK RELEASED GUIDANCE

01:33:32.474 --> 01:33:36.478 region:rollup2
IN SUPPORT OF MEDICARE

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:38.413 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN THESE MODELS

01:33:36.478 --> 01:33:40.215 region:rollup2
THOUGH I'D ALSO NOTE THAT THE

01:33:38.413 --> 01:33:42.217 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION OF MEDICARE IN STATE

01:33:40.215 --> 01:33:44.686 region:rollup2
INNOVATION MODELS IS SUBJECT TO

01:33:42.217 --> 01:33:46.654 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY. BY CMS.

01:33:44.686 --> 01:33:47.455 region:rollup2
FOR STATES THAT WANT TO

01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:49.224 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE MEDICARE

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:51.392 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN A STATE

01:33:49.224 --> 01:33:52.760 region:rollup2
INNOVATION MODEL THE PLAN MUST

01:33:51.392 --> 01:33:54.929 region:rollup2
ADHERE TO SEVERAL SPECIFIC

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:56.397 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES AND IT MUST HAVE A

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:57.899 region:rollup2
CLEARLY DEFINED TARGET

01:33:56.397 --> 01:34:00.201 region:rollup2
POPULATION EITHER.

01:33:57.899 --> 01:34:02.637 region:rollup2
AFFECTED PATIENTS OR AFFECTED

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:04.606 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS OR BOTH.

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:06.774 region:rollup2
IT MUST HAVE A CLEAR POTENTIAL

01:34:04.606 --> 01:34:08.009 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND REDUCE

01:34:06.774 --> 01:34:10.378 region:rollup2
THE SPENDING FOR THE COVERED

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:11.913 region:rollup2
POPULATION. AND THE STATE MUST

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:14.782 region:rollup2
HAVE DEMONSTRATED PREPAREDNESS

01:34:11.913 --> 01:34:15.984 region:rollup2
TO UNDERTAKE THE PROPOSAL.

01:34:14.782 --> 01:34:17.619 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY THAT AT THE END

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:19.287 region:rollup2
OF THE DAY THE DECISION RESTS

01:34:17.619 --> 01:34:21.122 region:rollup2
WITH THE INNOVATION CENTER AND

01:34:19.287 --> 01:34:23.391 region:rollup2
ITS FEDERAL PARTNERS. AS TO

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:24.826 region:rollup2
WHETHER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:26.794 region:rollup2
STATE'S PLAN UNDER THE STATE

01:34:24.826 --> 01:34:27.962 region:rollup2
INNOVATIONS MODEL OR ANY OF THE

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:30.398 region:rollup2
OTHER MODELS.

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:35.003 region:rollup2
THAT THE INNOVATION CENTER HAS

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:37.438 region:rollup2
STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO PURSUE.

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:39.340 region:rollup2
SO OBVIOUSLY A KEY QUESTION IT.

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:42.477 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIA IS WHETHER THE

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:44.712 region:rollup2
STATE CAN USE EXISTING CMMI

01:34:42.477 --> 01:34:47.048 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY OR SECTION FOUR OH TO

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:48.716 region:rollup2
MEDICARE WAIVER AUTHORITY. IN

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:50.585 region:rollup2
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SINGLE

01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:52.153 region:rollup2
PAYER SYSTEM.

01:34:50.585 --> 01:34:53.254 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THE

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:55.256 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES

01:34:53.254 --> 01:34:56.658 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT STATES PLAY A KEY

01:34:55.256 --> 01:34:58.626 region:rollup2
ROLE IN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND

01:34:56.658 --> 01:35:00.662 region:rollup2
REFORM EFFORTS.

01:34:58.626 --> 01:35:02.230 region:rollup2
AND HAS IN FACT OPENS THE DOOR

01:35:00.662 --> 01:35:05.433 region:rollup2
TO STATE INITIATIVES THAT

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:07.068 region:rollup2
INCLUDE MEDICARE PARTICIPATION.

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:08.803 region:rollup2
EXISTING AUTHORITY DOES IN FACT

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:10.071 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOR MODELS TESTING CHANGES

01:35:08.803 --> 01:35:12.507 region:rollup2
TO MEDICARE PAYMENT AND SERVICE

01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:13.908 region:rollup2
DELIVERY TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND

01:35:12.507 --> 01:35:15.710 region:rollup2
A CHIEF PROGRAM SAVINGS I'VE

01:35:13.908 --> 01:35:16.744 region:rollup2
SAID THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:18.513 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S CLEARLY THE

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:21.416 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TO TAKE STEPS TOWARD

01:35:18.513 --> 01:35:22.984 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATIVE SYSTEM CHANGE IN

01:35:21.416 --> 01:35:24.485 region:rollup2
THE STATE INNOVATION MODELS

01:35:22.984 --> 01:35:26.721 region:rollup2
UNDER THE INNOVATION CENTERS

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:28.089 region:rollup2
EXISTING AUTHORITY.

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:29.991 region:rollup2
BUT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:31.526 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THE STATE

01:35:29.991 --> 01:35:33.461 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED MORE THAN JUST A

01:35:31.526 --> 01:35:35.396 region:rollup2
WAIVER OF STATUTORY PROVISIONS

01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:37.465 region:rollup2
RELATED TO MEDICARE PAYMENT AND

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:38.933 region:rollup2
SERVICE DELIVERY. AND WOULD NEED

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:41.235 region:rollup2
TO SEEK PERMISSION TO MAKE

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:42.937 region:rollup2
BROADER CHANGES WHICH MAY NOT BE

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:44.939 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED IN THEIR ENTIRETY IN

01:35:42.937 --> 01:35:46.874 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT ROSTER OF INNOVATION

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:48.509 region:rollup2
CENTER ACTIVITIES. AND WHICH DO

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:49.677 region:rollup2
NOT SEEM TO FALL WITHIN THE

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:51.579 region:rollup2
SCOPE OF SECTION FOUR OH TO

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:53.114 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY.

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:55.049 region:rollup2
SEEKING PERMISSION FOR THE

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:57.018 region:rollup2
MEDICARE CHANGES THAT ARE LIKELY

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:58.519 region:rollup2
TO BE NEEDED FOR IMPLEMENTATION

01:35:57.018 --> 01:36:00.822 region:rollup2
OF A STATE BASED SINGLE PAYER

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:02.757 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WOULD BE A A DEPARTURE

01:36:00.822 --> 01:36:04.058 region:rollup2
FROM EXISTING APPLICATIONS OF

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:05.793 region:rollup2
THE DEMONSTRATION AND MODEL

01:36:04.058 --> 01:36:07.128 region:rollup2
TESTING PROCESS. WHEREBY THE

01:36:05.793 --> 01:36:08.563 region:rollup2
STATE WOULD BE SEEKING TO MAKE

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:09.764 region:rollup2
PERMANENT CHANGES TO THE STATE'S

01:36:08.563 --> 01:36:11.132 region:rollup2
ENTIRE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY

01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:13.234 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FOR ALL OF THE STATE'S

01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:15.403 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS. AND NOT JUST ON A

01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:17.005 region:rollup2
TIME LIMITED BASIS.

01:36:15.403 --> 01:36:19.340 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WITH THEM FOCUSED

01:36:17.005 --> 01:36:21.075 region:rollup2
MUCH BROADER THAN JUST MEDICARE

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:22.510 region:rollup2
PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY.

01:36:21.075 --> 01:36:23.478 region:rollup2
AND AS SUCH I THINK THERE IS A

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:25.713 region:rollup2
REALLY A GREAT DEAL OF

01:36:23.478 --> 01:36:28.182 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT AT

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:28.182 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AND PERHAPS

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:32.620 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION. WILL ENTERTAIN

01:36:30.685 --> 01:36:35.556 region:rollup2
THROUGH WAIVERS OR INNOVATION

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:37.358 region:rollup2
CENTER MODELS.

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:39.293 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD CONCLUDE BY SAYING

01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:40.528 region:rollup2
THAT I I THINK USING CMMI

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:43.197 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY OR OTHER MEDICARE

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:44.098 region:rollup2
WAIVER AUTHORITY. TO IMPLEMENT A

01:36:43.197 --> 01:36:46.834 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IN

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:48.136 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE NECESSARY.

01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:50.104 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE

01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:51.806 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT.

01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:54.275 region:rollup2
BEYONCE SEEKING PERMISSION FROM

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:55.843 region:rollup2
HHS FOR CHANGES THAT CAN BE MADE

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:57.779 region:rollup2
UNDER EXISTING AUTHORITY

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:59.514 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE AS IT MIGHT BE WITH

01:36:57.779 --> 01:37:02.050 region:rollup2
REGARD TO STATE INNOVATIVE

01:36:59.514 --> 01:37:03.484 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY. IT IS STILL THE CASE

01:37:02.050 --> 01:37:05.453 region:rollup2
THAT FEDERAL STATUTORY CHANGES

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:06.788 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NEEDED MEANING CONGRESS

01:37:05.453 --> 01:37:07.889 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO PASS AND THE

01:37:06.788 --> 01:37:09.190 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT WOULD NEED TO SIGN

01:37:07.889 --> 01:37:10.758 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION TO MAKE NUMEROUS

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:12.093 region:rollup2
CHANGES.

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:14.929 region:rollup2
I I THINK PERHAPS MOST

01:37:12.093 --> 01:37:17.131 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY THE EXISTING

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:18.633 region:rollup2
STATUTORY WAIVER PROCESS AND THE

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:21.302 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY GRANTED THE INNOVATION

01:37:18.633 --> 01:37:23.571 region:rollup2
CENTER DO NOT APPEAR TO PERMIT

01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:25.973 region:rollup2
THE HHS SECRETARY TO SIMPLY

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:26.607 region:rollup2
REDIRECTS. MEDICARE'S FUNDING

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:29.711 region:rollup2
STREAMS.

01:37:26.607 --> 01:37:31.412 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE PAYROLL TAXES THE

01:37:29.711 --> 01:37:34.282 region:rollup2
GENERAL REVENUES AND BENEFICIARY

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:36.484 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS OR TRUST FUND DOLLARS

01:37:34.282 --> 01:37:39.153 region:rollup2
TO STATES TO OVERSEE AND MANAGE

01:37:36.484 --> 01:37:40.254 region:rollup2
THESE FUNDS IN THEIR ENTIRETY ON

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:41.723 region:rollup2
BEHALF OF THE STATE'S ENTIRE

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:44.792 region:rollup2
MEDICARE POPULATION THROUGH A

01:37:41.723 --> 01:37:46.227 region:rollup2
STATE BASED HEALTH CARE PROGRAM.

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:47.895 region:rollup2
THE SECRETARY ALSO HAS NO

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:50.364 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO CHANGE MEDICARE

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:52.100 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY OR ENROLLMENT RULES.

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:54.502 region:rollup2
OR TO CHANGE THE RULES RELATED

01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:56.537 region:rollup2
TO HOW MUCH BENEFICIARIES PAY IN

01:37:54.502 --> 01:37:58.239 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING.

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:59.073 region:rollup2
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WOULD

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:00.875 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE CHANGED THROUGH

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:02.110 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO FULLY

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:03.711 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE MEDICARE

01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:05.546 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES IN THE STATE

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:07.148 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM.

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:08.616 region:rollup2
AND BEYOND THE LEGISLATIVE

01:38:07.148 --> 01:38:10.118 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:11.652 region:rollup2
INCORPORATING MEDICARE IN A

01:38:10.118 --> 01:38:12.987 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AT THE STATE

01:38:11.652 --> 01:38:15.423 region:rollup2
LEVEL WOULD REQUIRE A HIGH

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:17.091 region:rollup2
DEGREE OF COLLABORATION. BETWEEN

01:38:15.423 --> 01:38:18.926 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:21.396 region:rollup2
STATE TO MAKE IT WORK AND I

01:38:18.926 --> 01:38:22.430 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION AS

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:24.732 region:rollup2
TO THE WILLINGNESS OF THIS

01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:26.134 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION TO COLLABORATE.

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:28.669 region:rollup2
ON CHANGES OF THIS MAGNITUDE AT

01:38:26.134 --> 01:38:29.771 region:rollup2
THIS TIME.

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:31.706 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN THEN A CONDUCIVE

01:38:29.771 --> 01:38:33.674 region:rollup2
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE THAT

01:38:31.706 --> 01:38:34.675 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION EXISTED THE STATE

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:35.877 region:rollup2
WOULD REALLY NEED TO WORK

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:37.578 region:rollup2
CLOSELY WITH THE FEDERAL

01:38:35.877 --> 01:38:40.681 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS MANY

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:42.950 region:rollup2
STATUTORY. FIVE REGULATORY AND

01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:45.086 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES RELATED TO

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:46.721 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING MEDICARE INTO THE

01:38:45.086 --> 01:38:48.489 region:rollup2
STATE'S SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM.

01:38:46.721 --> 01:38:57.465 region:rollup2

OF THE KEY PROVISIONS.

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:13.407 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL.

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:15.343 region:rollup2
MEDICAID LAW REQUIRES THAT

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:17.678 region:rollup2
WEAVERS FURTHER THE OBJECTIVES

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:19.747 region:rollup2
OF THE PROGRAM SO I THE INTENT

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:22.083 region:rollup2
OF A DEMONSTRATION IS TO IN IN

01:40:19.747 --> 01:40:24.085 region:rollup2
SOME WAY MOVE FORWARD WHAT THE

01:40:22.083 --> 01:40:25.219 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PROGRAM I. WAS INTENDED

01:40:24.085 --> 01:40:26.287 region:rollup2
TO DO.

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:28.422 region:rollup2
IT'S AUTHORIZED FOR

01:40:26.287 --> 01:40:30.258 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES SUBJECT

01:40:28.422 --> 01:40:32.126 region:rollup2
TO EVALUATION SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:40:30.258 --> 01:40:34.328 region:rollup2
JULIET WAS SAYING ABOUT

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:35.563 region:rollup2
INNOVATION CENTER AUTHORITY. AND

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:37.365 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:40:35.563 --> 01:40:38.399 region:rollup2
THAT WAIVERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:40:37.365 --> 01:40:40.568 region:rollup2
TESTING SOMETHING SO THEY'RE

01:40:38.399 --> 01:40:41.702 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE. DOING SOMETHING

01:40:40.568 --> 01:40:43.604 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE FEDERAL

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:45.406 region:rollup2
LAW REQUIRES IN ORDER TO

01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:47.542 region:rollup2
EVALUATE AND.

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:49.543 region:rollup2
I IT IS THOSE EFFORTS

01:40:47.542 --> 01:40:51.512 region:rollup2
AND A WAIVER NEEDS TO AFFECT A

01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:53.214 region:rollup2
SECTION OF THE MEDICAID LOT THAT

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:55.182 region:rollup2
IS SUBJECT TO WAVER AND WE'LL

01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:57.251 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THAT MORE DEATH.

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:59.420 region:rollup2
BY LONG STANDING OF PRACTICE

01:40:57.251 --> 01:41:00.288 region:rollup2
WAIVERS MONTHS MUST BE BUDGET

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.989 region:rollup2
NEUTRAL TO THE FEDERAL

01:41:00.288 --> 01:41:03.758 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THAT MEANS THAT OVER

01:41:01.989 --> 01:41:05.893 region:rollup2
A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THE STATE'S

01:41:03.758 --> 01:41:07.695 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATION SHOULD NOT COST

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:09.730 region:rollup2
MORE. ADDED TO THE FEDERAL

01:41:07.695 --> 01:41:11.098 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ON THE MEDICAID SIDE

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:12.500 region:rollup2
THEN IT WOULD IN ABSENCE OF THE

01:41:11.098 --> 01:41:14.435 region:rollup2
WEAVER. THIS IS TYPICALLY

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.603 region:rollup2
EVALUATED ON A PER MEMBER PER

01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:17.572 region:rollup2
MONTH BASIS

01:41:15.603 --> 01:41:19.941 region:rollup2
BUDGET NEUTRALITY IS A BIG PART

01:41:17.572 --> 01:41:20.474 region:rollup2
OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE

01:41:19.941 --> 01:41:22.310 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:23.678 region:rollup2
STATE'S.

01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:24.211 region:rollup2
PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS ARE ALSO

01:41:23.678 --> 01:41:26.247 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BOTH AT THE STATE

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:28.115 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:41:26.247 --> 01:41:29.917 region:rollup2
AND THE AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:41:28.115 --> 01:41:31.552 region:rollup2
GIVEN JUST THE IMPORTANCE OF AYE

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:34.121 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY OF THE ELEVEN

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:35.656 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AND THE CHANGES THAT

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:37.725 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE CONTEMPLATED.

01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:40.061 region:rollup2
I THE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

01:41:37.725 --> 01:41:41.996 region:rollup2
SLIDE SHE GIVES YOU A.

01:41:40.061 --> 01:41:43.197 region:rollup2
BASICALLY AN OVERVIEW OF A LOT

01:41:41.996 --> 01:41:45.366 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMON.

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:47.735 region:rollup2
WAIVERS THAT WE'VE SEEN ACROSS

01:41:45.366 --> 01:41:50.171 region:rollup2
THE STATES. FOR ELEVEN FIFTEEN

01:41:47.735 --> 01:41:51.539 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY IN FACT CALIFORNIA HAS

01:41:50.171 --> 01:41:53.274 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE WAIVERS ARE NO

01:41:51.539 --> 01:41:54.775 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIAR TO YOU. I'VE

01:41:53.274 --> 01:41:56.077 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE MANY STATES

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:57.411 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED MANAGED CARE IN

01:41:56.077 --> 01:41:59.647 region:rollup2
THEIR STATES THROUGH ELEVEN

01:41:57.411 --> 01:42:01.749 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AUTHORITY PARTICULARLY.

01:41:59.647 --> 01:42:03.050 region:rollup2
IN THE EARLY YEARS BEFORE IT

01:42:01.749 --> 01:42:04.318 region:rollup2
BECAME EASIER TO DO THAT.

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:07.121 region:rollup2
UNDER.

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:09.056 region:rollup2
UNDER REGULAR MEDICAID LAW.

01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:11.559 region:rollup2
DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM WAIVERS

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:13.461 region:rollup2
ó OF WHICH CALIFORNIA HAS ONE.

01:42:11.559 --> 01:42:15.663 region:rollup2
AYE UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL

01:42:13.461 --> 01:42:17.531 region:rollup2
SWEAR TYPICALLY HOSPITALS ARE

01:42:15.663 --> 01:42:19.133 region:rollup2
GIVEN AT PAYMENTS FOR

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:21.869 region:rollup2
UNCOMPENSATED CARE.

01:42:19.133 --> 01:42:23.804 region:rollup2
AND EXPANSION RELATED OF WAIVERS

01:42:21.869 --> 01:42:26.340 region:rollup2
AGAIN A NUMBER OF STATES BEFORE

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:28.342 region:rollup2
THE ACA EXPANDED COVERAGE TO

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:29.710 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL POPULATION.

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:30.211 region:rollup2
SOME AFTER BUT MADE SOME

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:35.082 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS TO MEDICAID

01:42:30.211 --> 01:42:36.584 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:38.252 region:rollup2
SO THIS NEXT SLIDE REALLY

01:42:36.584 --> 01:42:40.021 region:rollup2
OUTLINES WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

01:42:38.252 --> 01:42:42.256 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PROVISIONS THAT THE

01:42:40.021 --> 01:42:43.324 region:rollup2
STATUTE MAKES CLEAR THAT ELEVEN

01:42:42.256 --> 01:42:44.892 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WAIVER CAN.

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:46.594 region:rollup2
.

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:47.995 region:rollup2
CAN CHANGE

01:42:46.594 --> 01:42:49.764 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS STATEWIDE MRS

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:51.198 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT IN THE FEDERAL LAW

01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:51.732 region:rollup2
THAT THE MEDICAID PROGRAM REALLY

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:53.934 region:rollup2
LOOK CONSISTENT ACROSS THE

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:56.804 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:42:53.934 --> 01:42:57.571 region:rollup2
I IN TERMS OF. HOW IT OPERATES

01:42:56.804 --> 01:42:58.839 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING

01:42:57.571 --> 01:43:00.074 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE WAIVED?

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:02.510 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO REQUIREMENT FOR

01:43:00.074 --> 01:43:04.245 region:rollup2
SINGLE STATE AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT

01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:05.813 region:rollup2
AND SET THE RULES ANOTHER

01:43:04.245 --> 01:43:07.214 region:rollup2
PROVISION THAT CAN BE WAIVED IN

01:43:05.813 --> 01:43:08.449 region:rollup2
MOST THESE KEY PROVISIONS ARE

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:10.918 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IN.

01:43:08.449 --> 01:43:12.219 region:rollup2
THE TEMPLATE THAT CMS PUTS OUT

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:14.088 region:rollup2
FOR STATES IS THEY'RE THINKING

01:43:12.219 --> 01:43:15.756 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEIR WAIVERS.

01:43:14.088 --> 01:43:17.625 region:rollup2
THE NEXT IS ELIGIBILITY AND

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:19.860 region:rollup2
REALLY CAN GO IN TWO DIRECTIONS

01:43:17.625 --> 01:43:22.296 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE USED THAT AND THEIR

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:24.532 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO EXPAND. IT TO WAVE

01:43:22.296 --> 01:43:25.699 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY TO EXPAND COVERAGE

01:43:24.532 --> 01:43:27.201 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ALSO GO IN A MORE

01:43:25.699 --> 01:43:28.936 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIVE WAY WHERE SOME

01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:30.671 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE IMPOSED TIME LIMITS

01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:32.873 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT CAPS.

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:35.976 region:rollup2
UNCERTAIN POPULATIONS

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:37.745 region:rollup2
AND I STATES MAY ALSO I WAVED

01:43:35.976 --> 01:43:39.480 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PRESUMPTIVE

01:43:37.745 --> 01:43:41.248 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY AND RETROACTIVE

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.017 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:45.453 region:rollup2
FOR BENEFITS AND SERVICES.

01:43:43.017 --> 01:43:46.721 region:rollup2
AGAIN STATES HAVE USED THAT

01:43:45.453 --> 01:43:49.390 region:rollup2
KIND OF AUTHORITY TO VARY

01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:50.791 region:rollup2
BENEFITS PARTICULARLY FOR AYE IS

01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:52.426 region:rollup2
THEY EXPANDED COVERAGE TO NEW

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:53.828 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS THEY MIGHT HAVE

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:55.796 region:rollup2
IMPOSED NEW THINGS LIKE.

01:43:53.828 --> 01:43:57.331 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS

01:43:55.796 --> 01:43:59.767 region:rollup2
OR BURIED THE BENEFITS.

01:43:57.331 --> 01:44:01.869 region:rollup2
FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS.

01:43:59.767 --> 01:44:03.237 region:rollup2
COST SHARING CAN BE WAIVED BUT

01:44:01.869 --> 01:44:05.239 region:rollup2
WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:07.408 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS IN THE LA.

01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:08.342 region:rollup2
THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:44:07.408 --> 01:44:10.344 region:rollup2
COST SHARING.

01:44:08.342 --> 01:44:11.412 region:rollup2
IN THE FORM OF DEDUCTIBLES AND

01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:14.014 region:rollup2
COPAYS.

01:44:11.412 --> 01:44:15.549 region:rollup2
MOSTLY BE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS

01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:17.585 region:rollup2
STATES ARE SUPPOSED TO ONLY

01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:19.320 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THOSE FOR TWO YEARS

01:44:17.585 --> 01:44:21.088 region:rollup2
THERE ARE YOU AGAIN THERE IS

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.058 region:rollup2
SOME FLEXIBILITY TO IMPOSE COST

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:25.926 region:rollup2
SHARING ABOVE. CURRENT STATUTORY

01:44:24.058 --> 01:44:28.162 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS BY.

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:29.764 region:rollup2
THOSE PROVISIONS THAT IT CANNOT

01:44:28.162 --> 01:44:30.998 region:rollup2
BE WAIVED ENTIRELY.

01:44:29.764 --> 01:44:33.400 region:rollup2
THE DELIVERY SYSTEM.

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:34.902 region:rollup2
AT ONE THAT STATES HAVE WAVES

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.470 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS OF FREEDOM AND

01:44:34.902 --> 01:44:38.072 region:rollup2
CHOICE PARTICULARLY. WHEN

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:39.406 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT MANAGED CARE AND

01:44:38.072 --> 01:44:40.040 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPES OF.

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:42.109 region:rollup2
OF.

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.644 region:rollup2
CHANGES THEIR.

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:45.479 region:rollup2
AND THEN IF FINANCING

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:47.515 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT WHICH IS OFTEN A

01:44:45.479 --> 01:44:49.416 region:rollup2
CORE PART OF ELEVEN FIFTEEN

01:44:47.515 --> 01:44:51.452 region:rollup2
WAIVER AUTHORITY WHERE THE STATE

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:52.920 region:rollup2
IS ASKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:44:51.452 --> 01:44:55.055 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:56.857 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T NORMALLY PAY COSTS THAT

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:59.760 region:rollup2
ARE NOT OTHERWISE MAGICAL.

01:44:56.857 --> 01:45:01.395 region:rollup2
AND SO I. AGAIN WITH CONSTRAINTS

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.265 region:rollup2
ON BUDGET NEUTRALITY IS A BIG

01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:05.766 region:rollup2
PART OF WAIVERS BUT I. DID BUT

01:45:04.265 --> 01:45:06.967 region:rollup2
UNDER ELEVEN FIFTEEN AUTHORITY

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:09.136 region:rollup2
MANY STATES HAVE GOTTEN

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:10.271 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO GET. COVERAGE FOR

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:13.240 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT

01:45:10.271 --> 01:45:14.708 region:rollup2
A THING.

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:16.944 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THAT'S ALREADY IN.

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:19.079 region:rollup2
MEDICAID ISRAEL IS QUITE BROAD

01:45:16.944 --> 01:45:22.283 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME RESTRICTIONS.

01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:24.018 region:rollup2
I'M WHAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.

01:45:22.283 --> 01:45:25.152 region:rollup2
UNDER THE STATUTE

01:45:24.018 --> 01:45:27.621 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE FIRST.

01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:29.590 region:rollup2
AT KEY ONES IS THE FEDERAL

01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:31.725 region:rollup2
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE OR

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:33.727 region:rollup2
F. MAP THAT FORMULA THAT IS

01:45:31.725 --> 01:45:35.462 region:rollup2
REALLY THE SPLIT BETWEEN WHAT

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:37.865 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:39.466 region:rollup2
STATE OUR PAIN. I'M IT VARIES

01:45:37.865 --> 01:45:40.067 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATES AND IT DOES

01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:41.468 region:rollup2
VERY.

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:43.337 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR FOR CERTAIN

01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:45.973 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:47.541 region:rollup2
FOR MOST SERVICES LESS COVERAGE

01:45:45.973 --> 01:45:49.910 region:rollup2
IT'S FIFTY PERCENT.

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:52.613 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IMPORTANT PROVISION.

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:54.014 region:rollup2
OF NOTE THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED

01:45:52.613 --> 01:45:55.516 region:rollup2
IF THE F. MAP CLAIMING

01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:57.918 region:rollup2
PROPHECIES.

01:45:55.516 --> 01:45:59.820 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I MEAN THERE IS THAT

01:45:57.918 --> 01:46:02.089 region:rollup2
WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:02.723 region:rollup2
WAVE WHAT CAN BE MATCHED.

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:04.892 region:rollup2
IT'S STILL.

01:46:02.723 --> 01:46:06.293 region:rollup2
IT IT IT'S STILL NEEDS TO BE A

01:46:04.892 --> 01:46:07.995 region:rollup2
MATCHING DOLLAR SO IN OTHER

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:09.296 region:rollup2
WORDS THE STATE PUTS UP FUNDS

01:46:07.995 --> 01:46:10.998 region:rollup2
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:13.200 region:rollup2
MATCHES THOSE FUNDS. SO THAT'S

01:46:10.998 --> 01:46:16.036 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT THINK I

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:18.072 region:rollup2
CAN BE WAIVED UNDER THE STATUTE.

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:19.940 region:rollup2
EVER END UNDER THE ELEVEN

01:46:18.072 --> 01:46:21.342 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AUTHORITY THEIR OTHER

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.710 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS I MENTION THE COST

01:46:21.342 --> 01:46:24.745 region:rollup2
SHARING REQUIREMENTS THAT THERE

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:26.080 region:rollup2
ARE RESTRICTIONS ON HOW MUCH

01:46:24.745 --> 01:46:28.082 region:rollup2
COST SHARING CAN BE WAIVED.

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:30.284 region:rollup2
INCOME COUNTING ROLES SO FOR THE

01:46:28.082 --> 01:46:31.151 region:rollup2
COR POPULATION COVERED UNDER THE

01:46:30.284 --> 01:46:34.655 region:rollup2
ACA.

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:36.690 region:rollup2
SO NOT THAT DISABLED AND I'M.

01:46:34.655 --> 01:46:39.093 region:rollup2
AND NOT AT THE ELDERLY THERE

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:41.195 region:rollup2
ARE. RESTRICTIONS ON CHANGING

01:46:39.093 --> 01:46:44.064 region:rollup2
HOW INCOME IS COUNTED AND AND

01:46:41.195 --> 01:46:46.166 region:rollup2
ASSETS TEST CANNOT BE IMPOSED.

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:47.301 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE KIND OF AN OVERVIEW

01:46:46.166 --> 01:46:49.169 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THAT THAT KEY

01:46:47.301 --> 01:46:51.772 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS.

01:46:49.169 --> 01:46:53.340 region:rollup2
AND YEAH I I THINK YOU ALL HAVE

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:54.441 region:rollup2
WITH YOU THAT WE JUST FINISHED A

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:56.176 region:rollup2
PAPER FOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:57.211 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. THAT

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:58.979 region:rollup2
LOOKS AT THE LEGAL

01:46:57.211 --> 01:47:00.614 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS AND AND WE TALK

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:01.782 region:rollup2
ABOUT SINGLE PAYER BUT WE ALSO

01:47:00.614 --> 01:47:03.384 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:05.252 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS THAT YOU MIGHT.

01:47:03.384 --> 01:47:07.454 region:rollup2
CONSIDER PUBLIC OPTION ANOTHER

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:09.657 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS AND.

01:47:07.454 --> 01:47:11.926 region:rollup2
I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH AND THE

01:47:09.657 --> 01:47:13.627 region:rollup2
MEDICAID SIDE ONE IMPORTANT NOTE

01:47:11.926 --> 01:47:15.362 region:rollup2
AND JULIET MADE THIS POINT.

01:47:13.627 --> 01:47:17.331 region:rollup2
THAT WAIVERS ARE DISCRETIONARY

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:18.666 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW I'VE GIVEN YOU AN

01:47:17.331 --> 01:47:20.334 region:rollup2
OUTLINE OF SOME OF THE

01:47:18.666 --> 01:47:22.569 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS THAT ARE SEEN.

01:47:20.334 --> 01:47:23.971 region:rollup2
EXPECTED. TO NOT BE WAIVED IN

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:25.506 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT CAN BE WAIVED.

01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:26.874 region:rollup2
AND IT'S TYPICALLY THE CASE

01:47:25.506 --> 01:47:27.474 region:rollup2
THAT ONCE SOMETHING HAS BEEN

01:47:26.874 --> 01:47:29.677 region:rollup2
WAIVED THAT THAT IS PERMITTED

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:31.578 region:rollup2
BY.

01:47:29.677 --> 01:47:33.113 region:rollup2
FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS I'M BUT

01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:34.715 region:rollup2
WE DO NOTE THAT.

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:37.451 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS.

01:47:34.715 --> 01:47:39.286 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HAVE DISCRETION ABOUT

01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:40.621 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:42.656 region:rollup2
APPROVE WAIVERS.

01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:44.692 region:rollup2
SO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:46.560 region:rollup2
WAIVERS ARE DISCRETIONARY.

01:47:44.692 --> 01:47:48.929 region:rollup2
SOFT UP WITH MEDICAID AND NOW

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:50.331 region:rollup2
SWITCH GEARS AND TALK ABOUT THE

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:52.599 region:rollup2

ESTABLISH EXCHANGES AND OF

01:48:04.011 --> 01:48:08.515 region:rollup2

APPROVE UNDER THIS AUTHORITY.

01:48:36.577 --> 01:48:38.946 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED IT'S IT'S FAIRLY

THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHICH WE

CAN WAIVE THE FEE CHOOSE TO.

01:49:08.242 --> 01:49:11.745 region:rollup2

DEPTH BUT I KNOW THAT STATES CAN

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:41.842 region:rollup2
USE THOSE DOLLARS AND REPURPOSE

01:49:40.908 --> 01:49:44.344 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:49:41.842 --> 01:49:46.713 region:rollup2

01:49:53.187 --> 01:49:56.790 region:rollup2
MAJOR CHANGES TO THE BENEFITS.

01:49:54.588 --> 01:49:58.992 region:rollup2
CITIES.

01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:59.993 region:rollup2
THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON.

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:02.196 region:rollup2
THE.

01:49:59.993 --> 01:50:03.230 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO A WAIVER

01:50:02.196 --> 01:50:04.932 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY.

01:50:03.230 --> 01:50:07.034 region:rollup2
MOST SAID THE CONSUMER

01:50:04.932 --> 01:50:09.436 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS BETTER IN THE A. C.

01:50:07.034 --> 01:50:11.105 region:rollup2
A. ARE ACTUALLY NOT WAY ABLE SO

01:50:09.436 --> 01:50:13.173 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE EACH RATING.

01:50:11.105 --> 01:50:16.176 region:rollup2
PROHIBITION ON.

01:50:13.173 --> 01:50:17.678 region:rollup2
HEALTH STATUS IS GENDER EXCITER.

01:50:16.176 --> 01:50:19.613 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE NOT WEAVERVILLE

01:50:17.678 --> 01:50:21.915 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS UNDER THIRTEEN THIRTY

01:50:19.613 --> 01:50:23.717 region:rollup2
TWO.

01:50:21.915 --> 01:50:25.219 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:26.954 region:rollup2
STATUTORY GUARDRAILS WHICH ARE

01:50:25.219 --> 01:50:28.822 region:rollup2
ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND

01:50:26.954 --> 01:50:30.491 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THINKING ABOUT.

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:32.759 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO A WAIVER

01:50:30.491 --> 01:50:35.028 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY. THE FIRST THE SCOPE

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:36.296 region:rollup2
OF COVERAGE WAIVERS MUST PROVIDE

01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:38.632 region:rollup2
COVERAGE TO AT LEAST AS MANY

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:41.702 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AS THE ACA WOULD.

01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:44.171 region:rollup2
IN ABSENCE OF THE WAIVER.

01:50:41.702 --> 01:50:45.839 region:rollup2
I'D THE WAIVER MUST ALSO A

01:50:44.171 --> 01:50:48.208 region:rollup2
PROVIDE COVERAGE THAT IS LEAST

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:50.511 region:rollup2
AS LEAST AS COMPREHENSIVE AS THE

01:50:48.208 --> 01:50:52.446 region:rollup2
COVERAGE OFFERED A ON IT.

01:50:50.511 --> 01:50:54.414 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE EXCHANGE

01:50:52.446 --> 01:50:55.983 region:rollup2
THE WAIVER MUST PROVIDE COVERAGE

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:57.584 region:rollup2
AND COST SHARING PROTECTIONS

01:50:55.983 --> 01:50:59.686 region:rollup2
AGAINST EXCESSIVE OUT OF POCKET

01:50:57.584 --> 01:51:01.955 region:rollup2
SPENDING THAT IS AT LEAST AS

01:50:59.686 --> 01:51:03.991 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE. OF THE EXCHANGE

01:51:01.955 --> 01:51:05.692 region:rollup2
COVERAGE AND THE WAIVER MUST NOT

01:51:03.991 --> 01:51:07.394 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE FEDERAL DEFICIT

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:10.497 region:rollup2
INCLUDING CHANGES TO INCOME

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:12.132 region:rollup2
PAYROLL FOR EXCISE TAX REVENUE.

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:14.234 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW YOU CAN

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:16.203 region:rollup2
REALLY TELL FROM THE FIRST THREE

01:51:14.234 --> 01:51:17.804 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE. RESTRICTIONS ARE

01:51:16.203 --> 01:51:19.139 region:rollup2
REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IF

01:51:17.804 --> 01:51:20.807 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS GOING TO COME IN

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:22.242 region:rollup2
AND AND MAKE CHANGES UNDER

01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:24.645 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO THAT THERE

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:26.346 region:rollup2
REALLY PROPOSING TO PROVIDE.

01:51:24.645 --> 01:51:28.148 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND.

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:30.317 region:rollup2
AT A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE

01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:31.385 region:rollup2
PACKAGE I KNOW THE DEFICIT

01:51:30.317 --> 01:51:33.720 region:rollup2
NEUTRALITY DOES.

01:51:31.385 --> 01:51:36.523 region:rollup2
EXTEND TO.

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:38.358 region:rollup2
IT YOUR YOUR EMPLOYMENT TO YOUR.

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:40.327 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT BOTH TREASURY AND

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:41.795 region:rollup2
HHS WHEN THINKING ABOUT DEFICIT

01:51:40.327 --> 01:51:43.797 region:rollup2
NEUTRALITY AND IT'S.

01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:45.532 region:rollup2
IT IS A DIFFERENT STANDARD THAN

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:46.600 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON IN THE BUDGET

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:48.802 region:rollup2
NEUTRALITY.

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:50.404 region:rollup2
IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM BECAUSE

01:51:48.802 --> 01:51:52.072 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

01:51:50.404 --> 01:51:53.373 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT BROADER.

01:51:52.072 --> 01:51:55.542 region:rollup2
SO THIS NEXT SLIDE JUST GIVES

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:55.909 region:rollup2
YOU AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:57.811 region:rollup2
KEY.

01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:59.112 region:rollup2
WAIVERS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED

01:51:57.811 --> 01:52:01.982 region:rollup2
BY STATES.

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:03.083 region:rollup2
UNDER THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO AND

01:52:01.982 --> 01:52:05.719 region:rollup2
DEFINITE COUPLE OF.

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:07.754 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS THAT WOULD HAVE SOME

01:52:05.719 --> 01:52:08.589 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE EAST

01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:11.291 region:rollup2
CA.

01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:13.627 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:16.063 region:rollup2
AN APPROVAL YET. OF THE MAJOR

01:52:13.627 --> 01:52:18.265 region:rollup2
MAJOR CHAINS MOST OF THE WAIVERS

01:52:16.063 --> 01:52:19.333 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED FALL

01:52:18.265 --> 01:52:20.534 region:rollup2
INTO THIS CATEGORY OF

01:52:19.333 --> 01:52:21.635 region:rollup2
REINSURANCE AND THOSE OF THE

01:52:20.534 --> 01:52:24.037 region:rollup2
WAIVERS.

01:52:21.635 --> 01:52:25.138 region:rollup2
AT THE BOTTOM ALASKA OREGON

01:52:24.037 --> 01:52:26.607 region:rollup2
MINNESOTA.

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:28.242 region:rollup2
ARE THE ONES WITH.

01:52:26.607 --> 01:52:28.942 region:rollup2
.

01:52:28.242 --> 01:52:31.578 region:rollup2
AT WITH.

01:52:28.942 --> 01:52:33.413 region:rollup2
APPROVED REINSURANCE WE VARIOUS

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:34.948 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE SEE IN THESE WAIVERS

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:36.917 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED

01:52:34.948 --> 01:52:39.920 region:rollup2
SOME FUNDING TO HELP COVER A

01:52:36.917 --> 01:52:41.822 region:rollup2
PORTION OF HIGH COST CLAIMS FOR

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:43.790 region:rollup2
HIGH COST INDIVIDUALS. IN THE

01:52:41.822 --> 01:52:45.525 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND THIS

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:46.960 region:rollup2
REALLY LOWERS PREMIUMS FOR

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:48.795 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:50.731 region:rollup2
EXCHANGE.

01:52:48.795 --> 01:52:52.065 region:rollup2
AND IT'S REALLY I THINK I WORTH

01:52:50.731 --> 01:52:54.101 region:rollup2
NOTING WHEN TALKING ABOUT

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:56.303 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY UP PROPOSALS TO

01:52:54.101 --> 01:52:56.770 region:rollup2
LOOK A LITTLE BIT AT REINSURANCE

01:52:56.303 --> 01:52:58.271 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF STATES ARE

01:52:56.770 --> 01:53:00.307 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING IT. REINSURANCE

01:52:58.271 --> 01:53:01.808 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY BENEFITS THOSE WHO

01:53:00.307 --> 01:53:03.877 region:rollup2
GET COVERAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL

01:53:01.808 --> 01:53:05.178 region:rollup2
MARKET AND WHO DO NOT QUALIFY

01:53:03.877 --> 01:53:05.812 region:rollup2
FOR TAX CREDITS.

01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:07.180 region:rollup2
SO.

01:53:05.812 --> 01:53:09.283 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF THE STATES THAT ARE

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:11.051 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING PROPOSALS BECAUSE

01:53:09.283 --> 01:53:12.819 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT PREMIUMS

01:53:11.051 --> 01:53:13.820 region:rollup2
THE TAX CREDITS REALLY DO ASSIST

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:15.489 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.623 region:rollup2
WHEN PREMIUMS INCREASE BUT

01:53:15.489 --> 01:53:17.891 region:rollup2
REINSURANCE IS ONE OF THE

01:53:16.623 --> 01:53:19.359 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES.

01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:20.827 region:rollup2
THAT STATES ARE CONSIDERING.

01:53:19.359 --> 01:53:23.597 region:rollup2
.

01:53:20.827 --> 01:53:25.632 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO LOWER PREMIUMS OVERALL

01:53:23.597 --> 01:53:27.301 region:rollup2
AND WHEN A STATE DOES THAT THEY

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:29.503 region:rollup2
BENEFIT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:53:27.301 --> 01:53:30.671 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY AYE TAX CREDITS ARE

01:53:29.503 --> 01:53:32.739 region:rollup2
LOWER THAN THEY WOULD BE

01:53:30.671 --> 01:53:34.274 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE AND SO THROUGH THESE

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:35.842 region:rollup2
ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVERS STATES

01:53:34.274 --> 01:53:38.378 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO GET. FEDERAL

01:53:35.842 --> 01:53:40.280 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO HELP OFFSET THE COSTS

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:42.215 region:rollup2
AND THE AMOUNTS HAVE A HAVE

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:44.484 region:rollup2
VARIED A BIT BASED ON CONDITIONS

01:53:42.215 --> 01:53:46.653 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE STATE'S. BUT ON THE

01:53:44.484 --> 01:53:49.022 region:rollup2
STATE'S OBSCENE AND SOME OF

01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:49.923 region:rollup2
THEIR COSTS OFFSET. UNDER THESE

01:53:49.022 --> 01:53:50.824 region:rollup2
REINSURANCE WAIVERS.

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:52.859 region:rollup2
SO.

01:53:50.824 --> 01:53:54.728 region:rollup2
.

01:53:52.859 --> 01:53:55.896 region:rollup2
THINKING AGAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:53:54.728 --> 01:53:57.698 region:rollup2
BROADLY.

01:53:55.896 --> 01:53:59.433 region:rollup2
L. AGAIN ELEVEN AT THIRTEEN

01:53:57.698 --> 01:54:01.101 region:rollup2
THIRTY TWO AUTHORITY IS PRETTY

01:53:59.433 --> 01:54:02.569 region:rollup2
BROAD WHERE STATES COULD TOTALLY

01:54:01.101 --> 01:54:04.905 region:rollup2
RE PURPOSE.

01:54:02.569 --> 01:54:06.440 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS AND USE THEM IN A

01:54:04.905 --> 01:54:07.641 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAY THAT'S A LITTLE

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:09.342 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:54:07.641 --> 01:54:10.477 region:rollup2
WITH THE REINSURANCE WAIVERS

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:12.612 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GETTING PASSED THROUGH

01:54:10.477 --> 01:54:15.582 region:rollup2
FUNDING WHICH IS THEY'RE MAKING

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:18.018 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF CHANGE TO. I'D THE

01:54:15.582 --> 01:54:19.920 region:rollup2
ACA AS IT IS AND THE FEDERAL

01:54:18.018 --> 01:54:22.189 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS GIVING THEM AS

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:24.024 region:rollup2
SOME SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THAT

01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:25.692 region:rollup2
SO. JUST TO KIND OF DISPUTE DRAW

01:54:24.024 --> 01:54:28.061 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BETWEEN TOTALLY RE

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:30.030 region:rollup2
PURPOSING THE DOLLARS VERSES ON

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:31.531 region:rollup2
A PROPOSAL THAT ACTUALLY ACHIEVE

01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:33.734 region:rollup2
SAVINGS TO THE FEDERAL

01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:35.535 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT. THERE REALLY ARE TWO

01:54:33.734 --> 01:54:37.204 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT STATES

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:39.106 region:rollup2
COULD THINK ABOUT WHEN THINKING

01:54:37.204 --> 01:54:40.140 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVER

01:54:39.106 --> 01:54:42.542 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY.

01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:44.378 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT AGAIN

01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:45.612 region:rollup2
IS JUST THE DEFICIT NEUTRALITY

01:54:44.378 --> 01:54:46.713 region:rollup2
IS A LITTLE BIT BROADER THAN

01:54:45.612 --> 01:54:48.115 region:rollup2
JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:50.684 region:rollup2
TAX CREDITS.

01:54:48.115 --> 01:54:52.252 region:rollup2
THE TREASURY IS LOOKING AT.

01:54:50.684 --> 01:54:54.154 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE

01:54:52.252 --> 01:54:54.621 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND IT'S ABOUT THE

01:54:54.154 --> 01:54:57.157 region:rollup2
OVERALL COSTS NOT HER

01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:59.493 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL.

01:54:57.157 --> 01:55:01.528 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE HAVE LIMITED

01:54:59.493 --> 01:55:02.863 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THERE BEEN A COUPLE

01:55:01.528 --> 01:55:03.930 region:rollup2
OF WAIVERS SOME OF THEM WITH

01:55:02.863 --> 01:55:06.099 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWN.

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:07.968 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T HAVE A FULL SENSE

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:09.503 region:rollup2
OF WHAT MIGHT BE A APPROVED.

01:55:07.968 --> 01:55:11.471 region:rollup2
.

01:55:09.503 --> 01:55:13.473 region:rollup2
BY THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION OUR

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:14.908 region:rollup2
FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS.

01:55:13.473 --> 01:55:17.577 region:rollup2
IN THE GUIDANCE ITSELF IT DOES

01:55:14.908 --> 01:55:19.913 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT THAT HHS AND TREASURY

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:22.549 region:rollup2
CAN REJECT A WAIVER EVEN IF IT

01:55:19.913 --> 01:55:23.950 region:rollup2
MEETS THE FOR GUARD RAILS SO.

01:55:22.549 --> 01:55:25.919 region:rollup2
JUST IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:27.988 region:rollup2
AS THE IN TERMS OF THINKING

01:55:25.919 --> 01:55:30.090 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE WAIVER AUTHORITY.

01:55:27.988 --> 01:55:31.625 region:rollup2
SO AS I SAID IN OUR PAPER WE

01:55:30.090 --> 01:55:34.060 region:rollup2
TALK IN MORE DEPTH ABOUT.

01:55:31.625 --> 01:55:34.795 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE COVERAGE PROPOSALS

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.596 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

01:55:34.795 --> 01:55:38.398 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAPER YOU SINGLE PAYER

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:40.133 region:rollup2
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER REALLY

01:55:38.398 --> 01:55:40.901 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I JUST LEAVE

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:42.536 region:rollup2
YOU WITH.

01:55:40.901 --> 01:55:44.838 region:rollup2
THESE THOUGHTS THERE'S

01:55:42.536 --> 01:55:47.174 region:rollup2
CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY FOR.

01:55:44.838 --> 01:55:48.809 region:rollup2
WAIVERS IN BOTH MEDICAID AND

01:55:47.174 --> 01:55:50.844 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE COVERAGE.

01:55:48.809 --> 01:55:52.712 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF YOUR

01:55:50.844 --> 01:55:53.447 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS MAY TEST NEW IDEAS AND

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:55.415 region:rollup2
SO.

01:55:53.447 --> 01:55:57.450 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:59.252 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH WHETHER HOW

01:55:57.450 --> 01:56:00.387 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WILL. WILL

01:55:59.252 --> 01:56:01.888 region:rollup2
PERCEIVE THOSE

01:56:00.387 --> 01:56:03.223 region:rollup2
THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:06.660 region:rollup2
MUCH SHOULD QUESTIONS FOR OUR

01:56:03.223 --> 01:56:08.328 region:rollup2
PANEL.

01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:13.467 region:rollup2
I HAVE.

01:56:08.328 --> 01:56:15.268 region:rollup2
START WITH.

01:56:13.467 --> 01:56:16.736 region:rollup2
I'M. THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS

01:56:15.268 --> 01:56:19.272 region:rollup2
SO I WANNA ASK ALL OF THEM AND

01:56:16.736 --> 01:56:20.407 region:rollup2
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHO TO

01:56:19.272 --> 01:56:24.444 region:rollup2
ADDRESS TWO. BUT.

01:56:20.407 --> 01:56:25.412 region:rollup2
.

01:56:24.444 --> 01:56:26.546 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE KNOW THE CURRENT

01:56:25.412 --> 01:56:28.014 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING AND THAT'S

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:29.082 region:rollup2
WHY WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT

01:56:28.014 --> 01:56:31.284 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES.

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:33.453 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING FROM YOU KNOW THE

01:56:31.284 --> 01:56:35.155 region:rollup2
COVERAGE AVAILABLE BEING

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:37.190 region:rollup2
RESTRICTED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:56:35.155 --> 01:56:38.625 region:rollup2
WAYS YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:41.194 region:rollup2
PATIENT.

01:56:38.625 --> 01:56:42.662 region:rollup2
EX AGAIN CARE THEY MAY NEED.

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:43.763 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH

01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:45.165 region:rollup2
HOOPS AND ALL KINDS OF

01:56:43.763 --> 01:56:45.799 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACY.

01:56:45.165 --> 01:56:52.606 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY ACCESS COVERAGE IS

01:56:45.799 --> 01:56:54.841 region:rollup2
WORTHLESS WITHOUT

01:56:52.606 --> 01:56:56.977 region:rollup2
ACCESS SO YOU KNOW I'M HOPING

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:59.646 region:rollup2
THAT AS WE REALLY. MOVES FORWARD

01:56:56.977 --> 01:57:01.414 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO CREATE A PLAN FOR

01:56:59.646 --> 01:57:03.116 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:04.951 region:rollup2
SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS. THAT

01:57:03.116 --> 01:57:06.052 region:rollup2
WE'RE EXPERIENCING.

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:07.654 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY I'M ONE OF THE

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:09.289 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS I HAD IS.

01:57:07.654 --> 01:57:10.857 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT GENERALLY THE

01:57:09.289 --> 01:57:13.093 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT PLANS HAVE NOT

01:57:10.857 --> 01:57:15.662 region:rollup2
INCLUDED LONG TERM CARE.

01:57:13.093 --> 01:57:17.831 region:rollup2
VISION OR DENTAL.

01:57:15.662 --> 01:57:20.066 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT BE.

01:57:17.831 --> 01:57:23.637 region:rollup2
IT ARE IS ANYONE DOING THAT IN

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:24.704 region:rollup2
THEIR STATE YOU KNOW OPTIONS OR.

01:57:23.637 --> 01:57:27.140 region:rollup2
HILL COULD THAT BE.

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:28.775 region:rollup2
PART OF A.

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:33.547 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND UNIVERSAL.

01:57:28.775 --> 01:57:36.650 region:rollup2
A PLAN THAT WE PUT FORWARD.

01:57:33.547 --> 01:57:38.752 region:rollup2
AND I.

01:57:36.650 --> 01:57:40.120 region:rollup2
THERE IT AT THAT. AREA RIGHT A

01:57:38.752 --> 01:57:41.321 region:rollup2
SO I THINK VISION AND DENTAL IN

01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.390 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR ARE.

01:57:41.321 --> 01:57:46.560 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT I THINK A NUMBER OF

01:57:43.390 --> 01:57:48.228 region:rollup2
STATES FIRE. SEE IS PRIORITIES.

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.696 region:rollup2
AND.

01:57:48.228 --> 01:57:51.498 region:rollup2
AND.

01:57:49.696 --> 01:57:53.333 region:rollup2
DO AND THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN

01:57:51.498 --> 01:57:56.970 region:rollup2
PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR THOSE TWO I

01:57:53.333 --> 01:57:59.172 region:rollup2
TO. FIND THE MARKETPLACE SIDE.

01:57:56.970 --> 01:58:02.409 region:rollup2
THAT ESTATE.

01:57:59.172 --> 01:58:04.277 region:rollup2
IT IT DOWN IT SP CAN EXPAND THE

01:58:02.409 --> 01:58:05.579 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT PACKAGE

01:58:04.277 --> 01:58:07.714 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE OF IF THE STATE

01:58:05.579 --> 01:58:09.416 region:rollup2
WANTS TO REQUIRE BENEFITS ABOVE

01:58:07.714 --> 01:58:11.718 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THEY CAN

01:58:09.416 --> 01:58:13.186 region:rollup2
DO SO THE ISSUE IS SHOW US. THAT

01:58:11.718 --> 01:58:16.356 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO DO IT USING STATE

01:58:13.186 --> 01:58:17.290 region:rollup2
FUNDS SO ON THE FEDERAL

01:58:16.356 --> 01:58:23.330 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T.

01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:24.998 region:rollup2
AT IT IS IS THAT FUNDING AS.

01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:27.033 region:rollup2
ON THE MEDICARE SIDE.

01:58:24.998 --> 01:58:30.270 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED.

01:58:27.033 --> 01:58:33.540 region:rollup2
UNDER SECTION FOUR OH TO THERE

01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:36.209 region:rollup2
IS AN OPTION TO TASK TO THE

01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:38.611 region:rollup2
ADDITION OF BENEFITS

01:58:36.209 --> 01:58:40.213 region:rollup2
UNDER MEDICARE THAT AREN'T THAT

01:58:38.611 --> 01:58:41.514 region:rollup2
AREN'T CURRENTLY PAID FOR BY

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:43.483 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

01:58:41.514 --> 01:58:46.152 region:rollup2
THAT COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

01:58:43.483 --> 01:58:49.022 region:rollup2
VISION AND DENTAL SERVICES.

01:58:46.152 --> 01:58:51.891 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE THE SECTION FOR AU

01:58:49.022 --> 01:58:54.127 region:rollup2
TO AUTHORITY RELATES TO.

01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:55.161 region:rollup2
PAYMENT FORSERVICES THAT ARE

01:58:54.127 --> 01:58:57.097 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE

01:58:55.161 --> 01:58:58.598 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY AND THE ECONOMY OF

01:58:57.097 --> 01:59:00.667 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM THOSE AT THEIR WORDS

01:58:58.598 --> 01:59:02.435 region:rollup2
IN THE STATUTE. I THINK IT WOULD

01:59:00.667 --> 01:59:03.737 region:rollup2
BE A STRETCH TO FIT LONG TERM

01:59:02.435 --> 01:59:06.773 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:59:03.737 --> 01:59:09.442 region:rollup2
UNDER THAT AUTHORITY. PRIMARILY

01:59:06.773 --> 01:59:11.011 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN EXPENSIVE.

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:13.380 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

01:59:11.011 --> 01:59:15.715 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A SCENARIO

01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:17.050 region:rollup2
WHERE ADDING THE LONG TERM CARE

01:59:15.715 --> 01:59:19.419 region:rollup2
BENEFIT.

01:59:17.050 --> 01:59:21.388 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LOWERS

01:59:19.419 --> 01:59:23.523 region:rollup2
COSTS AND NOT REALLY IS A HIGH

01:59:21.388 --> 01:59:25.859 region:rollup2
BAR FOR A BENEFIT LIKE LONG TERM

01:59:23.523 --> 01:59:26.693 region:rollup2
CARE VISION AND DENTAL I THINK

01:59:25.859 --> 01:59:28.395 region:rollup2
MAYBE.

01:59:26.693 --> 01:59:30.296 region:rollup2
LESS OF A STRETCH.

01:59:28.395 --> 01:59:32.165 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THEY CAN

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:33.667 region:rollup2
BE VERY ESSENTIAL TO QUALITY OF

01:59:32.165 --> 01:59:35.402 region:rollup2
LIFE AND AND MIGHT ACTUALLY YOU

01:59:33.667 --> 01:59:37.237 region:rollup2
KNOW IMPROVE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO

01:59:35.402 --> 01:59:39.372 region:rollup2
GET ABOUT ACCESS SERVICES KIND

01:59:37.237 --> 01:59:41.808 region:rollup2
OF. LIVE THEIR DAILY LIVES.

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:43.309 region:rollup2
BUT BUT LONG TERM CARE AND

01:59:41.808 --> 01:59:45.078 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ARE OBVIOUSLY TWO VERY

01:59:43.309 --> 01:59:47.747 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS.

01:59:45.078 --> 01:59:49.549 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE LONG TERM

01:59:47.747 --> 01:59:51.017 region:rollup2
CARE IS A MEDICAID BENEFIT NOT A

01:59:49.549 --> 01:59:52.185 region:rollup2
MEDICARE BENEFIT IT TYPICALLY

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:54.554 region:rollup2
HASN'T REALLY BEEN WITHIN THE

01:59:52.185 --> 01:59:56.890 region:rollup2
PURVIEW OF MEDICARE TO CONSIDER.

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:59.325 region:rollup2
REFORMS THAT MIGHT AND LONG TERM

01:59:56.890 --> 02:00:01.795 region:rollup2
CARE TO THE MEDICARE BENEFIT

01:59:59.325 --> 02:00:02.896 region:rollup2
PACKAGE.

02:00:01.795 --> 02:00:05.498 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD JUST ADD IN

02:00:02.896 --> 02:00:07.700 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MEDI CAL DOES COVER A

02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:09.736 region:rollup2
LONG TERM CARE. OF COURSE THAT'S

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:12.338 region:rollup2
THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. AND.

02:00:09.736 --> 02:00:13.940 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS OF THE ESSENTIAL

02:00:12.338 --> 02:00:16.209 region:rollup2
HEALTH BENEFITS BENCHMARK THE

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:19.179 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS SET FOR. THE

02:00:16.209 --> 02:00:21.614 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE PLANS ON CURRENTLY.

02:00:19.179 --> 02:00:23.149 region:rollup2
ADULT A DENTAL BENEFITS FOR

02:00:21.614 --> 02:00:24.751 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ARE NOT INCLUDED SO.

02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:26.252 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW SO ON THE

02:00:24.751 --> 02:00:28.054 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:29.956 region:rollup2
BENCHMARK PLAN THAT CHIQUITA WAS

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:30.490 region:rollup2
REFERRING TO EARLIER THAT IS THE

02:00:29.956 --> 02:00:32.992 region:rollup2
AVENUE BY WHICH YOU COULD

02:00:30.490 --> 02:00:34.861 region:rollup2
EXPAND.

02:00:32.992 --> 02:00:36.429 region:rollup2
WHAT IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL

02:00:34.861 --> 02:00:38.331 region:rollup2
HEALTH BENEFITS ON THE FLOOR FOR

02:00:36.429 --> 02:00:40.600 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA?

02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:42.302 region:rollup2
OKAY I'M JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:44.704 region:rollup2
TO. THEM.

02:00:42.302 --> 02:00:47.107 region:rollup2
IN ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS HEARINGS.

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:47.807 region:rollup2
WE DISCUSSED COST CONTAINMENT

02:00:47.107 --> 02:00:49.142 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE.

02:00:47.807 --> 02:00:50.677 region:rollup2
HEARD ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PLANS

02:00:49.142 --> 02:00:53.279 region:rollup2
AND OTHER STATES.

02:00:50.677 --> 02:00:55.115 region:rollup2
IN THEY WERE GIVING ADVICE ON

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:57.117 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW.

02:00:55.115 --> 02:00:58.752 region:rollup2
SET UP YOU WANNA DO COST

02:00:57.117 --> 02:01:00.286 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT UP FRONT BECAUSE.

02:00:58.752 --> 02:01:01.888 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE STATE'S THAT HAD

02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:03.456 region:rollup2
GONE DOWN THE ROAD.

02:01:01.888 --> 02:01:05.625 region:rollup2
FOUND THEY WEREN'T REALLY

02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:07.794 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING SAVINGS AND MAYBE

02:01:05.625 --> 02:01:11.831 region:rollup2
EVEN HAVE. ADDITIONAL COSTS.

02:01:07.794 --> 02:01:13.133 region:rollup2
.

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:16.236 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD YOU RECOMMEND WE GO

02:01:13.133 --> 02:01:17.904 region:rollup2
ABOUT STREAMLINING EFFICIENCIES?

02:01:16.236 --> 02:01:19.572 region:rollup2
AND THE BUREAUCRACY I MEAN YOU

02:01:17.904 --> 02:01:20.273 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HAVE ALREADY IN THE

02:01:19.572 --> 02:01:22.308 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT IS.

02:01:20.273 --> 02:01:23.643 region:rollup2
.

02:01:22.308 --> 02:01:25.845 region:rollup2
WHAT'S SPECIFIC GOALS SHOULD WE

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:27.013 region:rollup2
BE LOOKING FOR. AS WE LOOK TO A

02:01:25.845 --> 02:01:28.414 region:rollup2
PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD

02:01:27.013 --> 02:01:30.116 region:rollup2
HELP.

02:01:28.414 --> 02:01:32.685 region:rollup2
IN THE COST CONTAINMENT HOA BE

02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:35.054 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE NOSES GOES DOWN THE

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:36.222 region:rollup2
LINE WHO IS ACCOUNTABLE. IS THAT

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:37.690 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE IS IT YOU KNOW.

02:01:36.222 --> 02:01:40.627 region:rollup2
THE SIR I'M.

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:43.329 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY THAT.

02:01:40.627 --> 02:01:48.301 region:rollup2
AND WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT.

02:01:43.329 --> 02:01:49.802 region:rollup2
AND WHO THE LA AU PAIR.

02:01:48.301 --> 02:01:50.870 region:rollup2
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO BEGIN

02:01:49.802 --> 02:01:53.873 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT'S

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:55.909 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A CENTRAL QUESTION IN.

02:01:53.873 --> 02:01:57.143 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:01:55.909 --> 02:01:58.244 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMING OUR HEALTHCARE

02:01:57.143 --> 02:01:59.646 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:01:58.244 --> 02:02:01.915 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CLEARLY WITHIN

02:01:59.646 --> 02:02:03.983 region:rollup2
MEDICARE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF

02:02:01.915 --> 02:02:06.119 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:07.654 region:rollup2
INNOVATION CENTER THAT IT WAS IT

02:02:06.119 --> 02:02:10.256 region:rollup2
WAS SET UP.

02:02:07.654 --> 02:02:11.758 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO TEST THESE NEW MODELS

02:02:10.256 --> 02:02:13.626 region:rollup2
OF PAYING FOR CARE RECOGNIZING

02:02:11.758 --> 02:02:15.328 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:17.363 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE WAY WE DO IT NOW IS

02:02:15.328 --> 02:02:19.265 region:rollup2
NOT. WORKING SO WELL FOR

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:20.800 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:23.036 region:rollup2
EVEN WORKING SO WELL WITHIN

02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:25.939 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY.

02:02:23.036 --> 02:02:28.274 region:rollup2
CMS HAS BEEN OR YOU KNOW AT

02:02:25.939 --> 02:02:30.076 region:rollup2
LEAST HAD BEEN PRETTY AGGRESSIVE

02:02:28.274 --> 02:02:31.878 region:rollup2
IN TRYING TO TEST A LOT OF

02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:33.279 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT NEW IDEAS IT'S KIND OF

02:02:31.878 --> 02:02:34.547 region:rollup2
LIKE THROW EVERYTHING AT THE

02:02:33.279 --> 02:02:37.417 region:rollup2
WALL AND SEE WHAT STICKS.

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:38.017 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT'S ALSO A STRUGGLE I

02:02:37.417 --> 02:02:40.186 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:42.222 region:rollup2
TOOK TO FIND SAVINGS TO SOME

02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:44.324 region:rollup2
EXTENT WHEN YOU'RE TESTING SO

02:02:42.222 --> 02:02:46.860 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS.

02:02:44.324 --> 02:02:48.127 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AS AS I SHOWED AND IN

02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:50.363 region:rollup2
THAT ONE SLIDE ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:02:48.127 --> 02:02:52.131 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES THAT ARE BEING TESTED

02:02:50.363 --> 02:02:53.633 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE INNOVATION CENTER

02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:55.602 region:rollup2
THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

02:02:53.633 --> 02:02:57.136 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY GOING ON AT

02:02:55.602 --> 02:02:58.671 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEVEL AT THE PROVIDER

02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:59.772 region:rollup2
LEVEL. AT LOTS OF DIFFERENT

02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:00.974 region:rollup2
LEVELS WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:03.776 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:03:00.974 --> 02:03:05.845 region:rollup2
AND SO WHILE THAT'S GREAT.

02:03:03.776 --> 02:03:07.614 region:rollup2
IT ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO

02:03:05.845 --> 02:03:09.882 region:rollup2
REALLY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT

02:03:07.614 --> 02:03:12.118 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT'S HAVING AN EFFECTIVE

02:03:09.882 --> 02:03:14.120 region:rollup2
FOR ACTUALLY SEEING SAVINGS

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:15.855 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALSO WHY THEY.

02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:18.124 region:rollup2
THE INNOVATION CENTER REALLY

02:03:15.855 --> 02:03:19.425 region:rollup2
TRIES VERY CAREFULLY TO SET UP

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:21.361 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS.

02:03:19.425 --> 02:03:23.363 region:rollup2
SEC TEST.

02:03:21.361 --> 02:03:25.732 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE THE MODEL VERSES

02:03:23.363 --> 02:03:27.734 region:rollup2
VIENEN NOT MODEL TO FIGURE OUT

02:03:25.732 --> 02:03:29.936 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT IS WORKING AND A

02:03:27.734 --> 02:03:31.704 region:rollup2
MODEL OR WHAT'S NOT WORKING.

02:03:29.936 --> 02:03:33.072 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE KNOW WE DON'T INVEST

02:03:31.704 --> 02:03:34.807 region:rollup2
FURTHER RESOURCES AND THINGS

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:36.542 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T WORK.

02:03:34.807 --> 02:03:38.511 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:03:36.542 --> 02:03:41.180 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR IDEAS LIKE PATIENT

02:03:38.511 --> 02:03:41.814 region:rollup2
CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES AND

02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:43.283 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS

02:03:41.814 --> 02:03:44.851 region:rollup2
AND.

02:03:43.283 --> 02:03:46.319 region:rollup2
I PROVIDERS TALKING TO EACH

02:03:44.851 --> 02:03:47.654 region:rollup2
OTHER AND NOT ORDERING

02:03:46.319 --> 02:03:49.289 region:rollup2
DUPLICATIVE TESTS AND THINGS

02:03:47.654 --> 02:03:51.090 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT THESE THINGS ARE ALL

02:03:49.289 --> 02:03:53.826 region:rollup2
GREAT IDEAS BUT THEY DO TAKE A

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:56.362 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIME TO. BUILD UP TO GET

02:03:53.826 --> 02:03:58.031 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TO TO WORK TOGETHER

02:03:56.362 --> 02:04:00.433 region:rollup2
AND AND SPEAK TO EACH OTHER.

02:03:58.031 --> 02:04:02.201 region:rollup2
AND TO GET PATIENTS INTO THE

02:04:00.433 --> 02:04:03.536 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AS WELL AND TO REALLY

02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:05.905 region:rollup2
MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THIS TYPE

02:04:03.536 --> 02:04:07.040 region:rollup2
OF COORDINATED CARE SYSTEM SO I

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:08.474 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT'S ANSWERING YOUR

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:10.476 region:rollup2
QUESTION DIRECTLY BUT THERE'S

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:13.980 region:rollup2
CLEARLY A LOT OF INTEREST.

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:16.215 region:rollup2
IN PURSUING. BETTER WAY TO YOU

02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:18.451 region:rollup2
KNOW BRING ABOUT PAYMENT REFORMS

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:19.819 region:rollup2
AND DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORMS SO

02:04:18.451 --> 02:04:21.220 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE

02:04:19.819 --> 02:04:23.256 region:rollup2
GOALS THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:24.891 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING. THAT REQUIRE

02:04:23.256 --> 02:04:26.559 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL

02:04:24.891 --> 02:04:28.661 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT TO TEST THEM IN

02:04:26.559 --> 02:04:29.929 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND THE

02:04:28.661 --> 02:04:31.864 region:rollup2
MARKET.

02:04:29.929 --> 02:04:34.667 region:rollup2
WILLING PARTNER.

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:36.402 region:rollup2
IN CM MASS.

02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:38.571 region:rollup2
BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO THINK

02:04:36.402 --> 02:04:40.573 region:rollup2
THROUGH VERY CAREFULLY WHAT YOUR

02:04:38.571 --> 02:04:41.975 region:rollup2
GOALS ARE AND THE TARGET

02:04:40.573 --> 02:04:45.011 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS THAT YOU HAVE IN

02:04:41.975 --> 02:04:47.180 region:rollup2
MIND. TO DEVELOP VERY SPECIFIC.

02:04:45.011 --> 02:04:49.349 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO TEST.

02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:51.751 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF ACHIEVING SAVINGS

02:04:49.349 --> 02:04:57.056 region:rollup2
AND IMPROVING QUALITY WITHIN.

02:04:51.751 --> 02:04:59.459 region:rollup2
THE CONTEXT OF THOSE PRO.

02:04:57.056 --> 02:05:01.260 region:rollup2
I. JUST I HAVE A LOT BUT I'LL

02:04:59.459 --> 02:05:02.795 region:rollup2
JUST DO ONE AND THEN SAVE IT FOR

02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:06.299 region:rollup2
THAT THE NEXT HEARING HOW.

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:09.268 region:rollup2
AT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS IS.

02:05:06.299 --> 02:05:10.703 region:rollup2
PATIENT TRYING TO NAVIGATE.

02:05:09.268 --> 02:05:12.205 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PROCESS AND

02:05:10.703 --> 02:05:15.174 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I JUST LOOK AT. PEOPLE

02:05:12.205 --> 02:05:16.976 region:rollup2
I KNOW HAVE TO GO AND THEN YOU

02:05:15.174 --> 02:05:18.745 region:rollup2
KNOW THEY GO TO PRIMARY CARE BUT

02:05:16.976 --> 02:05:21.748 region:rollup2
THERE IMMEDIATELY REFER. AND

02:05:18.745 --> 02:05:24.250 region:rollup2
THEN THEY HAVE A NEED BUT THE

02:05:21.748 --> 02:05:25.785 region:rollup2
SPECIAL SAY SEND THEM TO NEVER.

02:05:24.250 --> 02:05:27.220 region:rollup2
GIVES THEM THE THING THAT THE

02:05:25.785 --> 02:05:28.488 region:rollup2
INITIAL REQUEST WAS FORMED IN

02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:30.056 region:rollup2
THE BACK WITH THE PRIMARY CARE

02:05:28.488 --> 02:05:31.657 region:rollup2
DOCTOR IN THEIR QUESTIONING WHY

02:05:30.056 --> 02:05:33.459 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN HAPPEN THEY CAN'T FIND

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:34.827 region:rollup2
THE FILE WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY

02:05:33.459 --> 02:05:36.262 region:rollup2
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THEY COULDN'T

02:05:34.827 --> 02:05:39.065 region:rollup2
FIND THE PATIENT'S FILE. AND

02:05:36.262 --> 02:05:41.267 region:rollup2
THEN YOU GET THE BILLS IN THE

02:05:39.065 --> 02:05:42.869 region:rollup2
MAIL ANNUAL WILL I HAVE

02:05:41.267 --> 02:05:44.971 region:rollup2
INSURANCE HOW COME I'M GETTING

02:05:42.869 --> 02:05:47.140 region:rollup2
THIS BILL AND. YOU KNOW JUST FOR

02:05:44.971 --> 02:05:49.709 region:rollup2
ME PERSONALLY HAVING GONE TO THE

02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:50.877 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOM LAST YEAR WHEN

02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:51.644 region:rollup2
DURING SESSION.

02:05:50.877 --> 02:05:53.813 region:rollup2
FOR A.

02:05:51.644 --> 02:05:54.881 region:rollup2
ANALOGY. SOMETHING AND IN THE I

02:05:53.813 --> 02:05:56.048 region:rollup2
WAS ALLERGIC TO.

02:05:54.881 --> 02:05:57.517 region:rollup2
EXCEPT FOR THE TECHNICIAN AT THE

02:05:56.048 --> 02:05:59.118 region:rollup2
DOOR NO ONE EVEN LOOKED AT ME

02:05:57.517 --> 02:06:00.286 region:rollup2
THE DOCTOR SHOOK MY HAND ON THE

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:01.687 region:rollup2
WAY OUT AND THEN I GOT A THREE

02:06:00.286 --> 02:06:03.456 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL. AND I

02:06:01.687 --> 02:06:05.057 region:rollup2
FOUND OUT THAT.

02:06:03.456 --> 02:06:06.159 region:rollup2
THE DOCTOR HAS TO PAY THE HIGH

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:07.894 region:rollup2
IN ORDER FOR THE TECHNICIAN TO

02:06:06.159 --> 02:06:09.095 region:rollup2
GET PAID A LITTLE BIT.

02:06:07.894 --> 02:06:10.797 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A WHOLE LOT OF

02:06:09.095 --> 02:06:14.534 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACY IN.

02:06:10.797 --> 02:06:16.035 region:rollup2
NO AS WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD I.

02:06:14.534 --> 02:06:17.937 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT US TO MAKE SURE WE.

02:06:16.035 --> 02:06:18.638 region:rollup2
SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE COST

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:24.677 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT PART THIS ONE.

02:06:18.638 --> 02:06:26.979 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:28.114 region:rollup2
FIRST I'D LIKE TO JUST THANK THE

02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:29.682 region:rollup2
PANEL HEALTHCARE IS AWFULLY

02:06:28.114 --> 02:06:31.217 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED AND UNDERSTANDING

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:33.186 region:rollup2
WHERE SOME OF THOSE ROADBLOCKS

02:06:31.217 --> 02:06:34.821 region:rollup2
ARE IS BENEFICIAL.

02:06:33.186 --> 02:06:37.423 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD FIND

02:06:34.821 --> 02:06:39.092 region:rollup2
THE NEEDLE WITHIN THE HAYSTACK

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:40.626 region:rollup2
THOUGH AND DOCTOR COMMANDS CAN.

02:06:39.092 --> 02:06:41.894 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT ON. UNDER YOUR

02:06:40.626 --> 02:06:43.429 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES FOR INNOVATION CENTER

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:46.199 region:rollup2
MODELS.

02:06:43.429 --> 02:06:47.700 region:rollup2
YOU NOT GLOSSED OVER THE STRONG

02:06:46.199 --> 02:06:48.968 region:rollup2
STARTS FROM MOTHERS AND NEWBORN

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:50.670 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES AND.

02:06:48.968 --> 02:06:52.071 region:rollup2
I HAVE

02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:53.506 region:rollup2
QUITE AN INTEREST IN THIS BOTH

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:54.106 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I HAVE A TWO FIVE AND

02:06:53.506 --> 02:06:56.309 region:rollup2
SIX YEAR OLD AT HOME BUT ALSO

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:58.277 region:rollup2
IN.

02:06:56.309 --> 02:06:59.378 region:rollup2
TRYING TO IMPLEMENT A HOME

02:06:58.277 --> 02:07:00.980 region:rollup2
VISITING PROGRAM HERE IN OUR

02:06:59.378 --> 02:07:01.447 region:rollup2
STATE AND WANT TO HEAR MORE

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:04.417 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT PROGRAM IN

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:06.452 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

02:07:04.417 --> 02:07:08.054 region:rollup2
SO I DIDN'T REALLY TALK MUCH

02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:09.522 region:rollup2
ABOUT THOSE OTHER CATEGORIES TO

02:07:08.054 --> 02:07:11.657 region:rollup2
SOME EXTENT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

02:07:09.522 --> 02:07:13.926 region:rollup2
AS FOCUSED ON MEDICARE.

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:17.597 region:rollup2
THAT SAID.

02:07:13.926 --> 02:07:18.898 region:rollup2
CLEARLY YOU KNOW BASED ON THE.

02:07:17.597 --> 02:07:20.900 region:rollup2
THE CATEGORIES THAT THE

02:07:18.898 --> 02:07:22.435 region:rollup2
INNOVATION CENTER IS PURSUING

02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:24.237 region:rollup2
AND EVEN IF YOU READ THE STATUTE

02:07:22.435 --> 02:07:25.738 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT MORE.

02:07:24.237 --> 02:07:28.374 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES.

02:07:25.738 --> 02:07:29.041 region:rollup2
THAT ARE LISTED IN THE STATUTE

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:31.677 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS.

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:34.080 region:rollup2
MODELS THAT CAN BE TESTED.

02:07:31.677 --> 02:07:35.781 region:rollup2
THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:37.150 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY THAT THE STATE CAN

02:07:35.781 --> 02:07:38.317 region:rollup2
PURSUE WITH REGARD TO THESE

02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:39.485 region:rollup2
INNOVATION MODELS AND BY

02:07:38.317 --> 02:07:40.786 region:rollup2
GLOSSING OVER IT I DIDN'T MEAN

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:43.623 region:rollup2
TO MAKE LIGHT OF IT.

02:07:40.786 --> 02:07:44.957 region:rollup2
AYE I JUST MOSTLY I MEANT TO

02:07:43.623 --> 02:07:46.159 region:rollup2
CONVEY THAT THAT'S TO SOME

02:07:44.957 --> 02:07:47.393 region:rollup2
EXTENT OUTSIDE MY AREA OF

02:07:46.159 --> 02:07:49.128 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE.

02:07:47.393 --> 02:07:51.731 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:53.266 region:rollup2
BUT HE YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S

02:07:51.731 --> 02:07:55.234 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH AN INTEREST WITHIN THE

02:07:53.266 --> 02:07:57.003 region:rollup2
INNOVATION CENTER AT HEARING

02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:58.271 region:rollup2
FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE IDEAS IT

02:07:57.003 --> 02:07:58.771 region:rollup2
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE A STATE

02:07:58.271 --> 02:08:00.339 region:rollup2
IT CAN BE AN INDIVIDUAL

02:07:58.771 --> 02:08:01.841 region:rollup2
PROVIDER.

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:04.844 region:rollup2
OR A PROVIDER GROUP.

02:08:01.841 --> 02:08:06.379 region:rollup2
OR ANYBODY REALLY CAN CAN GO TO

02:08:04.844 --> 02:08:07.346 region:rollup2
THE INNOVATION CENTER WITH AN

02:08:06.379 --> 02:08:09.949 region:rollup2
IDEA.

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:12.185 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO YOU KNOW IMPROVE

02:08:09.949 --> 02:08:14.020 region:rollup2
QUALITY AND REDUCE SPENDING.

02:08:12.185 --> 02:08:14.820 region:rollup2
WITHIN MEDICARE MEDICAID AND

02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:17.723 region:rollup2
CHIP.

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:20.393 region:rollup2
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

02:08:17.723 --> 02:08:21.194 region:rollup2
STATE HAD COMES UP WITH SPECIFIC

02:08:20.393 --> 02:08:23.095 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT.

02:08:21.194 --> 02:08:25.164 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED

02:08:23.095 --> 02:08:26.966 region:rollup2
IN IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC IDEAS

02:08:25.164 --> 02:08:30.069 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE.

02:08:26.966 --> 02:08:30.903 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO TEST WITH THEN UP YOU

02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:33.706 region:rollup2
KNOW THE STATE HEALTH CARE

02:08:30.903 --> 02:08:35.074 region:rollup2
DELIVERY SYSTEM I THINK THE CMMI

02:08:33.706 --> 02:08:36.542 region:rollup2
WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:39.712 region:rollup2
HEARING.

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:43.516 region:rollup2
FROM FROM YOU ABOUT THOSE IDEAS

02:08:39.712 --> 02:08:44.884 region:rollup2
AND I'M AND WORKING WITH YEAR

02:08:43.516 --> 02:08:47.320 region:rollup2
TWO TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK.

02:08:44.884 --> 02:08:48.554 region:rollup2
SO FOLLOW UP A FIVE MAN OF

02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:50.856 region:rollup2
HEART AND DIRECT SOMEONE

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:52.625 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY WILL WANTS TO. MAKE

02:08:50.856 --> 02:08:53.726 region:rollup2
SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF IF I

02:08:52.625 --> 02:08:54.660 region:rollup2
CAN HOW MISS BROOKS WILSHIRE.

02:08:53.726 --> 02:08:55.728 region:rollup2
YOU POINT OUT THAT THE STATE

02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:57.163 region:rollup2
CANNOT GET A WAIVER FROM HER

02:08:55.728 --> 02:08:58.097 region:rollup2
THAT MEDICAID F. MAP CLAIMING

02:08:57.163 --> 02:08:59.398 region:rollup2
PROCESS ISN'T.

02:08:58.097 --> 02:09:02.034 region:rollup2
SO IF CALIFORNIA HAS A PUBLICLY

02:08:59.398 --> 02:09:03.636 region:rollup2
FINANCED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AS A

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:05.171 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM.

02:09:03.636 --> 02:09:07.039 region:rollup2
WHAT CALIFORNIA BE ABLE TO GET A

02:09:05.171 --> 02:09:08.541 region:rollup2
WAIVER TO MORE EFFICIENTLY BILL

02:09:07.039 --> 02:09:09.842 region:rollup2
THE?

02:09:08.541 --> 02:09:12.678 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRINT SHARE

02:09:09.842 --> 02:09:13.946 region:rollup2
OF THOSE QUALIFIED FOR MEDICARE.

02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:15.281 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH CALIFORNIA

02:09:13.946 --> 02:09:17.550 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO RETAIN THE

02:09:15.281 --> 02:09:19.452 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS AND FOR

02:09:17.550 --> 02:09:20.953 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION AND

02:09:19.452 --> 02:09:22.555 region:rollup2
OTHER RECORD KEEPING TO CAPTURE

02:09:20.953 --> 02:09:24.757 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL FUNDS

02:09:22.555 --> 02:09:25.858 region:rollup2
IS THAT RIGHT. SO AND WE TALK

02:09:24.757 --> 02:09:27.393 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS MORE IN THE PAPER I

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:28.995 region:rollup2
THINK THEY'RE A COUPLE OF WAYS

02:09:27.393 --> 02:09:29.428 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA COULD GO UP THE

02:09:28.995 --> 02:09:32.531 region:rollup2
COULD GO.

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:34.834 region:rollup2
TO DRAWDOWN MEDICAID FUNDS THE

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:36.802 region:rollup2
ONE WAY WOULD BE CERTAINLY TO

02:09:34.834 --> 02:09:38.838 region:rollup2
FOLLOW ALL THE MEDICAID RULES

02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:41.073 region:rollup2
WHICH REALLY WOULD REQUIRE.

02:09:38.838 --> 02:09:42.608 region:rollup2
AND UP FRONT ELIGIBILITY

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:44.944 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION.

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:47.647 region:rollup2
AND IT MAY BE THAT TO THE

02:09:44.944 --> 02:09:48.581 region:rollup2
CONSUMER TO PEOPLE IT'S NOT AS

02:09:47.647 --> 02:09:50.016 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS.

02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:51.217 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:09:50.016 --> 02:09:53.819 region:rollup2
OF A BACK DOOR.

02:09:51.217 --> 02:09:55.354 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT PROCESS IN PLACE.

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:57.356 region:rollup2
THIS SECOND WAY THAT YOU COULD

02:09:55.354 --> 02:09:59.692 region:rollup2
GO IS LOOK FOR FEDERAL FUNDS.

02:09:57.356 --> 02:10:02.128 region:rollup2
IT IS LOOK FOR A FEDERAL WAIVER

02:09:59.692 --> 02:10:04.563 region:rollup2
AND TRY TO GET SOME FLEXIBILITY

02:10:02.128 --> 02:10:06.165 region:rollup2
ON THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION

02:10:04.563 --> 02:10:07.433 region:rollup2
WE DO SAY THAT WE DO YOU THINK

02:10:06.165 --> 02:10:08.668 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO SOME

02:10:07.433 --> 02:10:10.970 region:rollup2
KIND OF ELIGIBILITY

02:10:08.668 --> 02:10:11.504 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION. THAT SENSE OF BUT

02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:13.205 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT BE.

02:10:11.504 --> 02:10:14.440 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SO

02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:15.041 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF DOING IT UP FRONT

02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:16.275 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU

02:10:15.041 --> 02:10:18.477 region:rollup2
DO.

02:10:16.275 --> 02:10:19.679 region:rollup2
AFTER PEOPLE ARE ALREADY

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:22.181 region:rollup2
ENROLLED.

02:10:19.679 --> 02:10:23.983 region:rollup2
AND AND SO WE DO THINK THERE

02:10:22.181 --> 02:10:25.885 region:rollup2
ARE SOME POSSIBILITIES THAT.

02:10:23.983 --> 02:10:27.386 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA COULD TRY THAT

02:10:25.885 --> 02:10:29.255 region:rollup2
APPROACH WE DO THINK THAT WOULD

02:10:27.386 --> 02:10:30.890 region:rollup2
THAT THAT AT SOME POINT THERE'S

02:10:29.255 --> 02:10:32.258 region:rollup2
GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF

02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:32.425 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION.

02:10:32.258 --> 02:10:35.194 region:rollup2
AND.

02:10:32.425 --> 02:10:37.029 region:rollup2
.

02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:38.497 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M THE.

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:42.101 region:rollup2
GO LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU ALL

02:10:38.497 --> 02:10:43.135 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR EXPERTISE.

02:10:42.101 --> 02:10:47.907 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND.

02:10:43.135 --> 02:10:49.675 region:rollup2
I AM.

02:10:47.907 --> 02:10:51.077 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND

02:10:49.675 --> 02:10:52.712 region:rollup2
THIS ON SOME ASK YOU A COUPLE

02:10:51.077 --> 02:10:54.580 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL DE DO YOU

02:10:52.712 --> 02:10:56.816 region:rollup2
HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF.

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:59.351 region:rollup2
HOW VERMONT PROCEEDED AND AND

02:10:56.816 --> 02:11:01.887 region:rollup2
HOW FAR DID DATE YET?

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:03.723 region:rollup2
THROUGH A PROCESS OF OVERWEIGHT

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:05.991 region:rollup2
OF WAIVERS AND AND.

02:11:03.723 --> 02:11:08.327 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT.

02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:10.429 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT VERMONT

02:11:08.327 --> 02:11:13.199 region:rollup2
GOT SO FAR AS.

02:11:10.429 --> 02:11:15.000 region:rollup2
TO TRIP UP ON THAT.

02:11:13.199 --> 02:11:17.136 region:rollup2
HOW TO PAY FOR IT

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.004 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND DIDN'T ACTUALLY

02:11:17.136 --> 02:11:21.273 region:rollup2
RESOLVE THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO

02:11:19.004 --> 02:11:23.075 region:rollup2
DO WITH MEDICARE?

02:11:21.273 --> 02:11:25.144 region:rollup2
SO I I BELIEVE THEY'RE IT WAS

02:11:23.075 --> 02:11:26.879 region:rollup2
AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO HOW THE

02:11:25.144 --> 02:11:28.414 region:rollup2
EXTENT TO WHICH.

02:11:26.879 --> 02:11:30.416 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD INCORPORATE MEDICARE

02:11:28.414 --> 02:11:32.518 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN THEIR SINGLE

02:11:30.416 --> 02:11:34.019 region:rollup2
PAYER SYSTEM AND IF THEY WENT

02:11:32.518 --> 02:11:35.688 region:rollup2
DOWN THAT PASSED HOW THEY WOULD

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:37.723 region:rollup2
GO ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF SEEKING

02:11:35.688 --> 02:11:39.525 region:rollup2
WAIVER AUTHORITY. THROUGH

02:11:37.723 --> 02:11:41.527 region:rollup2
SECTION FOUR OH TO ARE THE

02:11:39.525 --> 02:11:43.262 region:rollup2
INNOVATION CENTER. BUT I DON'T

02:11:41.527 --> 02:11:44.630 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THOSE DETAILS GOT IRONED

02:11:43.262 --> 02:11:45.131 region:rollup2
OUT SO UNFORTUNATELY THAT

02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:47.166 region:rollup2
DOESN'T OFFER YOU. MUCH

02:11:45.131 --> 02:11:47.967 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE.

02:11:47.166 --> 02:11:51.103 region:rollup2
.

02:11:47.967 --> 02:11:52.238 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT.

02:11:51.103 --> 02:11:54.273 region:rollup2
SO IT WOULD GET IT OBVIOUSLY

02:11:52.238 --> 02:11:54.874 region:rollup2
WAIVERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:57.343 region:rollup2
TESTING TESTING SOMETHING I.

02:11:54.874 --> 02:11:59.311 region:rollup2
AND.

02:11:57.343 --> 02:12:01.213 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO BE RENEWED. AFTER

02:11:59.311 --> 02:12:02.548 region:rollup2
FIVE TYPICALLY.

02:12:01.213 --> 02:12:04.550 region:rollup2
DO DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:12:02.548 --> 02:12:05.151 region:rollup2
TO DO THEY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:05.951 region:rollup2
WHOA WHOA WHOA WE'RE TWO YEARS

02:12:05.151 --> 02:12:07.920 region:rollup2
INTO THIS.

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:09.355 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA.

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:12.024 region:rollup2
STOP THE WAVER ME DECIDE EVER

02:12:09.355 --> 02:12:13.259 region:rollup2
HAPPENED OR.

02:12:12.024 --> 02:12:14.927 region:rollup2
I I I DON'T DO DOES THAT HAPPEN

02:12:13.259 --> 02:12:16.595 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW.

02:12:14.927 --> 02:12:18.130 region:rollup2
SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS.

02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:20.766 region:rollup2
IS MONITORING THAT.

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:21.367 region:rollup2
AND THEY DO LOOK AT WAIVERS AYE

02:12:20.766 --> 02:12:22.334 region:rollup2
THE AGAIN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

02:12:21.367 --> 02:12:24.770 region:rollup2
BE.

02:12:22.334 --> 02:12:26.472 region:rollup2
A FIVE YEAR PERIOD BUT THEY DO

02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:27.940 region:rollup2
CHECK IN TO SAY.

02:12:26.472 --> 02:12:29.542 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE ON A YEARLY

02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:31.110 region:rollup2
BASIS TO DO AN EVALUATION AND.

02:12:29.542 --> 02:12:33.112 region:rollup2
.

02:12:31.110 --> 02:12:34.613 region:rollup2
AND LOOK TO SEE IF THINGS ARE

02:12:33.112 --> 02:12:36.182 region:rollup2
GOING AWRY SO.

02:12:34.613 --> 02:12:37.483 region:rollup2
I CAN'T THINK OF A SPECIFIC

02:12:36.182 --> 02:12:39.051 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE

02:12:37.483 --> 02:12:40.686 region:rollup2
IS ONE ISN'T ONE.

02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:42.121 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:12:40.686 --> 02:12:43.789 region:rollup2
HAS ACTUALLY PULLED A WAIVER

02:12:42.121 --> 02:12:45.324 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE FIVE YEARS THAT

02:12:43.789 --> 02:12:47.459 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO AND

02:12:45.324 --> 02:12:47.793 region:rollup2
GET BACK TO YOU ON BUT BUT THERE

02:12:47.459 --> 02:12:50.996 region:rollup2
IS?

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:52.932 region:rollup2
IT. REALLY IS A YEARLY LOOK TO

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:54.834 region:rollup2
SEE HOW THE STATE IS DOING BUT

02:12:52.932 --> 02:12:56.802 region:rollup2
THEY ARE STILL EVALUATED. THAT

02:12:54.834 --> 02:12:59.004 region:rollup2
THEIR VALUE WAITED OVER A FIVE

02:12:56.802 --> 02:13:01.273 region:rollup2
YEAR PERIOD ON THE MEDICAID.

02:12:59.004 --> 02:13:02.675 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY ON THE MEDICARE SIDE

02:13:01.273 --> 02:13:05.744 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN I KNOW YOU HEARD MORE

02:13:02.675 --> 02:13:07.379 region:rollup2
IN FAR MORE DETAIL ON ON ALAN'S.

02:13:05.744 --> 02:13:09.915 region:rollup2
WAIVER AND THEY'RE ALL PAYER

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:12.451 region:rollup2
MODEL BUT I BELIEVE THAT.

02:13:09.915 --> 02:13:14.687 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT WAS IT ORIGINALLY

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:17.823 region:rollup2
INCORPORATED IN STATUTE.

02:13:14.687 --> 02:13:20.392 region:rollup2
AS BASICALLY YOU KNOW MEDICARE

02:13:17.823 --> 02:13:22.061 region:rollup2
ALLOWING MARYLAND TO PAY

02:13:20.392 --> 02:13:22.895 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL'S DIFFERENTLY THAN THE

02:13:22.061 --> 02:13:24.563 region:rollup2
WAY MEDICARE NORMALLY PAYS

02:13:22.895 --> 02:13:26.532 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS.

02:13:24.563 --> 02:13:27.733 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WAS CONTINGENT UPON

02:13:26.532 --> 02:13:29.668 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING SPECIFIC SAVINGS

02:13:27.733 --> 02:13:30.035 region:rollup2
TARGETS.

02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:31.403 region:rollup2
AND.

02:13:30.035 --> 02:13:32.705 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THE PAYMENT

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:35.174 region:rollup2
MECHANISM WAS BASICALLY A

02:13:32.705 --> 02:13:37.610 region:rollup2
PAYMENT PER HOSPITAL ADMISSION.

02:13:35.174 --> 02:13:40.012 region:rollup2
AND MARYLAND REALIZED THAT THEY

02:13:37.610 --> 02:13:41.580 region:rollup2
WERE AT SOME POINT NOT GOING TO

02:13:40.012 --> 02:13:43.849 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE ACHIEVING THOSE

02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:45.551 region:rollup2
SAVINGS TARGETS AND THAT THAT

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:47.219 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD NOT HAVE THAT

02:13:45.551 --> 02:13:49.121 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY RENEWED.

02:13:47.219 --> 02:13:52.625 region:rollup2
THE SO THEY NEEDED TO.

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:54.894 region:rollup2
AND UNDERTAKE CHANGES TO THE

02:13:52.625 --> 02:13:56.929 region:rollup2
THEIR AND IT ORIGINAL WAIVER

02:13:54.894 --> 02:13:58.130 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHICH RESULTED IN THE

02:13:56.929 --> 02:14:00.833 region:rollup2
ALL PAYER MODEL THAT THEY NOW

02:13:58.130 --> 02:14:02.167 region:rollup2
HAVE WHICH IS TRANSFORMING FROM

02:14:00.833 --> 02:14:03.269 region:rollup2
THERE YOU KNOW PAYMENT PER

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:04.970 region:rollup2
ADMISSION TO MORE OF A GLOBAL

02:14:03.269 --> 02:14:06.539 region:rollup2
PAYMENT.

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:08.107 region:rollup2
FOR A PATIENT FOR AN ENTIRE

02:14:06.539 --> 02:14:11.277 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:14:08.107 --> 02:14:11.710 region:rollup2
SO IT IT'S TRANSFORMING RATHER

02:14:11.277 --> 02:14:14.480 region:rollup2
THAN.

02:14:11.710 --> 02:14:16.015 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JUST PAYING A SPECIFIC

02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:17.349 region:rollup2
RATE FOR HOSPITAL ADMISSION

02:14:16.015 --> 02:14:19.118 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMING THE HOSPITAL'S

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:20.853 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES TO REALLY TRY TO KEEP

02:14:19.118 --> 02:14:21.954 region:rollup2
PATIENTS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. AS

02:14:20.853 --> 02:14:24.657 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO BRING THEM INTO THE

02:14:21.954 --> 02:14:27.626 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL THE POINT IS THERE

02:14:24.657 --> 02:14:30.095 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL WAIVER IS MORPHING FROM

02:14:27.626 --> 02:14:32.064 region:rollup2
THE STATUTORY WAIVER TO THE CMMI

02:14:30.095 --> 02:14:33.666 region:rollup2
INNOVATION CENTER AUTHORITY. AND

02:14:32.064 --> 02:14:35.868 region:rollup2
THAT DOES HAVE TO BE RENEWED

02:14:33.666 --> 02:14:37.369 region:rollup2
EVERY FOUR YEARS IT IT SEEMS TO

02:14:35.868 --> 02:14:40.472 region:rollup2
ME THAT.

02:14:37.369 --> 02:14:42.308 region:rollup2
THEY MAY BE MOVING AWAY FROM.

02:14:40.472 --> 02:14:44.443 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW GRANTING SORT OF

02:14:42.308 --> 02:14:45.744 region:rollup2
PERMANENT WAIVERS OR STATUTORY

02:14:44.443 --> 02:14:46.645 region:rollup2
CHANGES

02:14:45.744 --> 02:14:49.014 region:rollup2
TO THEY.

02:14:46.645 --> 02:14:51.116 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TRYING TO TEST THINGS

02:14:49.014 --> 02:14:52.918 region:rollup2
AND DEMONSTRATE THINGS THROUGH

02:14:51.116 --> 02:14:54.553 region:rollup2
THE THEY INNOVATION CENTER WITH

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:56.188 region:rollup2
REGARD TO MEDICARE PAYMENTS.

02:14:54.553 --> 02:14:57.890 region:rollup2
WE THAT'S NOT THE CASE I THINK

02:14:56.188 --> 02:15:00.259 region:rollup2
FROM MEDICARE IN A CA.

02:14:57.890 --> 02:15:01.727 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW THEY'RE SO

02:15:00.259 --> 02:15:03.562 region:rollup2
THE DRIVING INTEREST IS IS

02:15:01.727 --> 02:15:05.764 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SAVINGS.

02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:07.933 region:rollup2
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU

02:15:05.764 --> 02:15:09.468 region:rollup2
KNOW YOUR WAY FOR WHATEVER IT IS

02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:11.904 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT'S DESIGNED CONTINUES

02:15:09.468 --> 02:15:13.305 region:rollup2
TO DEMONSTRATE PROGRAM SAVINGS.

02:15:11.904 --> 02:15:13.772 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S KIND OF HARD TO AS

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:16.308 region:rollup2
LONG AS QUALITY IS NOT

02:15:13.772 --> 02:15:19.011 region:rollup2
SUFFERING.

02:15:16.308 --> 02:15:20.112 region:rollup2
THEN I DON'T SEE WHY THE

02:15:19.011 --> 02:15:21.914 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WOULD NECESSARILY

02:15:20.112 --> 02:15:23.282 region:rollup2
STEP INTO POLITICAL ACT. IF

02:15:21.914 --> 02:15:24.850 region:rollup2
THEIR SAVINGS THAT THAT'S YOU

02:15:23.282 --> 02:15:26.285 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:27.152 region:rollup2
GOALS SO.

02:15:26.285 --> 02:15:28.153 region:rollup2
I'M THINKING ABOUT.

02:15:27.152 --> 02:15:30.155 region:rollup2
.

02:15:28.153 --> 02:15:32.124 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD.

02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:33.425 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY AT A MINIMUM THE

02:15:32.124 --> 02:15:34.526 region:rollup2
REVIEW IF WE WERE TO MOVE

02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:36.762 region:rollup2
TOWARDS A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM

02:15:34.526 --> 02:15:37.896 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE A MEDICAID WAIVER.

02:15:36.762 --> 02:15:39.932 region:rollup2
AND MEDICARE WAIVER AT A MINIMUM

02:15:37.896 --> 02:15:41.934 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:15:39.932 --> 02:15:43.168 region:rollup2
I SENSE THAT IT'S MORE BECAUSE

02:15:41.934 --> 02:15:44.703 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY MORE COMPLICATED MEET

02:15:43.168 --> 02:15:46.305 region:rollup2
IT FEELS LIKE MORE MULTIPLE

02:15:44.703 --> 02:15:49.408 region:rollup2
WAIVERS WITHIN EACH OF THOSE

02:15:46.305 --> 02:15:52.211 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES ARE MY MISSING SO.

02:15:49.408 --> 02:15:54.179 region:rollup2
AT YOU WOULD I THINK YOU IF

02:15:52.211 --> 02:15:55.881 region:rollup2
IT'S YOUR PROBABLY AMANDA

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:58.217 region:rollup2
MEDICAID WAIVER YOU'RE. GONNA

02:15:55.881 --> 02:15:59.752 region:rollup2
NEED A THIRTEEN THIRTY TO WAVER

02:15:58.217 --> 02:16:00.986 region:rollup2
ON THE MARKETPLACE SIDE.

02:15:59.752 --> 02:16:02.454 region:rollup2
ANDS

02:16:00.986 --> 02:16:03.389 region:rollup2
YEAH YEAH AND WHAT KIND OF

02:16:02.454 --> 02:16:05.524 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY YOU NEED ON THE

02:16:03.389 --> 02:16:07.593 region:rollup2
MEDICARE SIDE IS NOT ENTIRELY

02:16:05.524 --> 02:16:09.895 region:rollup2
CLEAR. BUT IN ADDITION TO

02:16:07.593 --> 02:16:11.730 region:rollup2
WHATEVER AUTHORITY YOU SEEK AS

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:13.465 region:rollup2
FAR AS THE WAY FOR.

02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:15.734 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED LEGISLATIVE

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:18.003 region:rollup2
CHANGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IF

02:16:15.734 --> 02:16:18.537 region:rollup2
THE SENATE ETHICS IT YEAH IT'S

02:16:18.003 --> 02:16:21.206 region:rollup2
INCOMPLETE TO JUST SEEK A

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:22.508 region:rollup2
WAIVER.

02:16:21.206 --> 02:16:25.010 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE EXISTING

02:16:22.508 --> 02:16:27.312 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY IS PRETTY BROAD.

02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:28.947 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO READING OF THE

02:16:27.312 --> 02:16:30.482 region:rollup2
STATUTE IN AT AS FAR AS I READ

02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:32.217 region:rollup2
IT.

02:16:30.482 --> 02:16:35.521 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW THE STATE TO SORT OF

02:16:32.217 --> 02:16:37.890 region:rollup2
LAY CLAIM TO ALL OF THE MEDICARE

02:16:35.521 --> 02:16:38.857 region:rollup2
AND TRUST FUND DOLLARS AND USE

02:16:37.890 --> 02:16:40.526 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:16:38.857 --> 02:16:42.428 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE'S

02:16:40.526 --> 02:16:44.930 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PROGRAM.

02:16:42.428 --> 02:16:47.366 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T REALLY COMPORT

02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:50.169 region:rollup2
WITH THE EXISTING AUTHORITY THAT

02:16:47.366 --> 02:16:51.904 region:rollup2
THE SECRETARY OF HHS HAS.

02:16:50.169 --> 02:16:54.640 region:rollup2
SO FOR THAT YOU NEED

02:16:51.904 --> 02:16:56.775 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE CHANGE IF YOU WANTED

02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.610 region:rollup2
TO DO SOMETHING NOT QUITE AS

02:16:56.775 --> 02:17:00.779 region:rollup2
COMPLETE AS SINGLE PAYER.

02:16:58.610 --> 02:17:03.048 region:rollup2
LIKE MAYBE IN ALL PAYER SYSTEM

02:17:00.779 --> 02:17:03.615 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THIS

02:17:03.048 --> 02:17:06.351 region:rollup2
STATUTE GOVERNING CMMI THAT

02:17:03.615 --> 02:17:08.987 region:rollup2
DOES.

02:17:06.351 --> 02:17:11.390 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:12.925 region:rollup2
STATES TO TEST ALL PAYER SYSTEMS

02:17:11.390 --> 02:17:14.626 region:rollup2
SO THAT I THINK IS AN AVENUE

02:17:12.925 --> 02:17:15.894 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD PURSUE IT'S

02:17:14.626 --> 02:17:17.596 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SAME AS

02:17:15.894 --> 02:17:19.998 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:22.134 region:rollup2
BUT IT COULD GET YOU SOMEWHERE

02:17:19.998 --> 02:17:22.901 region:rollup2
DOWN THE PATH TOWARDS PERHAPS

02:17:22.134 --> 02:17:25.070 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:26.004 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COST ISSUES THAT

02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:28.874 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED.

02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:30.809 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALTER AND THAT.

02:17:28.874 --> 02:17:31.777 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY KIND OF.

02:17:30.809 --> 02:17:32.611 region:rollup2
PAIN IN THE* FOR A LOT OF

02:17:31.777 --> 02:17:34.947 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:35.547 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:17:34.947 --> 02:17:38.283 region:rollup2
REALISTICALLY.

02:17:35.547 --> 02:17:39.351 region:rollup2
THE WAIVER PROCESS IN GENERAL

02:17:38.283 --> 02:17:40.385 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF THESE.

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:41.687 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES THAT HAVE GONE

02:17:40.385 --> 02:17:43.322 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:17:41.687 --> 02:17:44.790 region:rollup2
HOW LONG DOES SOMETHING LIKE

02:17:43.322 --> 02:17:46.658 region:rollup2
THAT TAKE?

02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:47.559 region:rollup2
AS I START THINKING ABOUT OKAY

02:17:46.658 --> 02:17:48.494 region:rollup2
WE WANNA WANNA PUSH SOMETHING

02:17:47.559 --> 02:17:50.395 region:rollup2
FOR YOU.

02:17:48.494 --> 02:17:53.999 region:rollup2
HOW LONG?

02:17:50.395 --> 02:17:54.366 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE A. AN ENORMOUS.

02:17:53.999 --> 02:17:56.735 region:rollup2
LEFT I.

02:17:54.366 --> 02:17:58.437 region:rollup2
ON ON OUR AND IS A STATE YES

02:17:56.735 --> 02:17:59.705 region:rollup2
HOW LONG DEEP WITH THAT

02:17:58.437 --> 02:18:02.574 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY PROSPER SAYS

02:17:59.705 --> 02:18:04.343 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY TAPE.

02:18:02.574 --> 02:18:07.613 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY YEARS.

02:18:04.343 --> 02:18:09.148 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK PROBABLY THAT YOU

02:18:07.613 --> 02:18:10.716 region:rollup2
COULDN'T DO IT IN LESS THAN

02:18:09.148 --> 02:18:12.184 region:rollup2
TWELVE MONTHS AND I WOULD SAY

02:18:10.716 --> 02:18:13.585 region:rollup2
PROBABLY MORE LIKE TWO TO THREE

02:18:12.184 --> 02:18:16.421 region:rollup2
YEARS.

02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:17.289 region:rollup2
.

02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:19.158 region:rollup2
THAT'S AND I DO WANNA MENTION

02:18:17.289 --> 02:18:21.293 region:rollup2
THAT IT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA DOES

02:18:19.158 --> 02:18:23.395 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ELEVEN FIFTEEN MEDICAID

02:18:21.293 --> 02:18:24.229 region:rollup2
WAIVER AS IT IS SO. AND THERE

02:18:23.395 --> 02:18:26.431 region:rollup2
ARE QUITE A LOT OF.

02:18:24.229 --> 02:18:27.933 region:rollup2
.

02:18:26.431 --> 02:18:29.368 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTS BEING DONE UNDER

02:18:27.933 --> 02:18:31.937 region:rollup2
ELEVEN FIFTEEN LIKE THE WHOLE

02:18:29.368 --> 02:18:33.505 region:rollup2
PERSON PROGRAM THAT LOOKS AT

02:18:31.937 --> 02:18:35.207 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAYS TO

02:18:33.505 --> 02:18:37.643 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND

02:18:35.207 --> 02:18:39.645 region:rollup2
IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES WITHIN.

02:18:37.643 --> 02:18:41.747 region:rollup2
MEDICAID AND EVEN WITH THE DUAL

02:18:39.645 --> 02:18:43.182 region:rollup2
DUALLY ELIGIBLE PROGRAM SO FOLKS

02:18:41.747 --> 02:18:44.850 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE BOTH MEDICARE AND

02:18:43.182 --> 02:18:46.418 region:rollup2
MEDICAID SO.

02:18:44.850 --> 02:18:48.787 region:rollup2
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:18:46.418 --> 02:18:50.389 region:rollup2
US TO MAKE SURE BUILDING ON ALL

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:54.226 region:rollup2
THE EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE.

02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:54.827 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE SO FAR.

02:18:54.226 --> 02:18:58.297 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:18:54.827 --> 02:18:59.464 region:rollup2
ANYONE.

02:18:58.297 --> 02:19:00.065 region:rollup2
OWNER WERE BUILT ON SOME

02:18:59.464 --> 02:19:00.232 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS A DOCTOR WOULD JUST

02:19:00.065 --> 02:19:01.700 region:rollup2
ASK

02:19:00.232 --> 02:19:03.335 region:rollup2
SO GIVEN THAT IT'LL TAKE TWO TO

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:05.604 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS.

02:19:03.335 --> 02:19:06.638 region:rollup2
AND LET'S JUST.

02:19:05.604 --> 02:19:07.940 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT REAL POLITIQUE.

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:09.107 region:rollup2
AT THIS MOMENT WE'VE AN

02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:10.609 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD NOT BE

02:19:09.107 --> 02:19:12.778 region:rollup2
OPEN TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:19:10.609 --> 02:19:14.880 region:rollup2
BUT MAYBE AFTER TWENTY TWENTY WE

02:19:12.778 --> 02:19:17.282 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT. WOULD IT MAKE SENSE

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:18.650 region:rollup2
FOR US TO APPLY. TO THREE ARE

02:19:17.282 --> 02:19:20.652 region:rollup2
THE YEARS OUT BEFORE TWENTY

02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:22.487 region:rollup2
TWENTY OR. OR IF YOU HAVE AN

02:19:20.652 --> 02:19:23.822 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THAT IS ADVERSE

02:19:22.487 --> 02:19:24.990 region:rollup2
TO THE TYPE AWAY FROM WERE

02:19:23.822 --> 02:19:26.458 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT.

02:19:24.990 --> 02:19:27.626 region:rollup2
A APPLYING IN TWO THOUSAND

02:19:26.458 --> 02:19:29.261 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN OR TWO THOUSAND

02:19:27.626 --> 02:19:29.761 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WHAT WITH THAT. WITH

02:19:29.261 --> 02:19:32.231 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:19:29.761 --> 02:19:33.899 region:rollup2
LACK OF SUPPORT STYMIE RIGHT UP

02:19:32.231 --> 02:19:35.033 region:rollup2
THAT THE AT THE FRONT SUCH THAT

02:19:33.899 --> 02:19:36.602 region:rollup2
IT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:37.903 region:rollup2
APPLY FOR. THE WAIVER IF YOU

02:19:36.602 --> 02:19:38.403 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A SYMPATHETIC

02:19:37.903 --> 02:19:40.439 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION FROM THE

02:19:38.403 --> 02:19:42.040 region:rollup2
BEGINNING.

02:19:40.439 --> 02:19:43.909 region:rollup2
WELL I MIGHT START BY THE END BY

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:45.110 region:rollup2
THINKING AND I THINK SUSAN YOU

02:19:43.909 --> 02:19:46.511 region:rollup2
WERE ALLUDING TO THIS THING

02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:48.647 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME OF THE STEPS THAT

02:19:46.511 --> 02:19:50.415 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED WOULD BE NECESSARY

02:19:48.647 --> 02:19:52.150 region:rollup2
AND THOUGHT THROUGH BEFORE EVEN

02:19:50.415 --> 02:19:53.485 region:rollup2
GOING TO THE ADMINISTRATION SO

02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:55.954 region:rollup2
JUST TO LOOK AT. ON THE

02:19:53.485 --> 02:19:58.557 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE SIDE TYPICALLY.

02:19:55.954 --> 02:20:00.525 region:rollup2
PLANS NEED TO KNOW SIX MONTHS

02:19:58.557 --> 02:20:02.995 region:rollup2
IN ADVANCE WHAT COVERAGE IS

02:20:00.525 --> 02:20:04.229 region:rollup2
GONNA LOOK LIKE SO YOU KNOW YOU

02:20:02.995 --> 02:20:06.064 region:rollup2
WOULD WANT TO HAVE AUTHORIZING

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:07.366 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION MAKING A MAJOR

02:20:06.064 --> 02:20:08.433 region:rollup2
CHANGE. ALMOST.

02:20:07.366 --> 02:20:10.235 region:rollup2
.

02:20:08.433 --> 02:20:11.770 region:rollup2
DE.

02:20:10.235 --> 02:20:12.738 region:rollup2
I NOW HAVE TIME FOR THE PLANS TO

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:14.840 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT KIND OF AND AN

02:20:12.738 --> 02:20:16.475 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENT AND ENOUGH TIME FOR

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:18.610 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVE

02:20:16.475 --> 02:20:19.745 region:rollup2
THAT SO WHEN YOU BACK INTO JUST

02:20:18.610 --> 02:20:21.380 region:rollup2
A CHANGE THAT WOULD BE ON THE

02:20:19.745 --> 02:20:23.815 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE SIDE. YOU'RE REALLY

02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:25.017 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT PROBABLY A YEAR

02:20:23.815 --> 02:20:26.385 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU WANT TO CHANGE JUST.

02:20:25.017 --> 02:20:28.587 region:rollup2
.

02:20:26.385 --> 02:20:30.055 region:rollup2
EH AGAIN THINKING ABOUT A

02:20:28.587 --> 02:20:31.623 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD

02:20:30.055 --> 02:20:33.625 region:rollup2
POLICY BUT WHERE THE PLANS WE

02:20:31.623 --> 02:20:35.260 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO SOMETHING. SO I MIGHT

02:20:33.625 --> 02:20:36.695 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT OKAY THAN ON THE

02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:38.297 region:rollup2
MEDICAID SIDE IF WE'RE MAKING A

02:20:36.695 --> 02:20:39.731 region:rollup2
MAJOR CHANGE HOW DOES THAT FIT

02:20:38.297 --> 02:20:42.134 region:rollup2
IN WITH ALL OF THE OTHER.

02:20:39.731 --> 02:20:45.270 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

02:20:42.134 --> 02:20:46.805 region:rollup2
BEEN MEDI CAL TIME AND AND AND.

02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:48.407 region:rollup2
REALLY START THERE.

02:20:46.805 --> 02:20:50.375 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:20:48.407 --> 02:20:51.610 region:rollup2
IT IS SO THAT I WOULD WOULD BE

02:20:50.375 --> 02:20:52.611 region:rollup2
MY SUGGESTION ABOUT PUBLIC THE

02:20:51.610 --> 02:20:54.012 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACE TO START TO REALLY

02:20:52.611 --> 02:20:56.181 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE OKAY WHAT'S

02:20:54.012 --> 02:20:59.318 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ARE COHESIVE PLAN.

02:20:56.181 --> 02:21:01.453 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD AND THEN THEN

02:20:59.318 --> 02:21:01.987 region:rollup2
GETTING MAKING SURE YOU MOVED IT

02:21:01.453 --> 02:21:04.656 region:rollup2
THROUGH. YOUR LEGISLATIVE

02:21:01.987 --> 02:21:07.259 region:rollup2
BODIES.

02:21:04.656 --> 02:21:09.194 region:rollup2
BEFORE STARTING THAT IS

02:21:07.259 --> 02:21:10.996 region:rollup2
STARTING THE WAIVER PROCESS IT'S

02:21:09.194 --> 02:21:12.631 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THEY'LL

02:21:10.996 --> 02:21:13.632 region:rollup2
BE ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION WHO IS

02:21:12.631 --> 02:21:15.467 region:rollup2
MORE INTERESTED.

02:21:13.632 --> 02:21:16.668 region:rollup2
IN SOME OF THESE POLICIES BUT

02:21:15.467 --> 02:21:18.837 region:rollup2
IN SOME WAYS.

02:21:16.668 --> 02:21:20.806 region:rollup2
THINGS NEED TO BE TESTED AND.

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:22.207 region:rollup2
SO I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T

02:21:20.806 --> 02:21:23.408 region:rollup2
SPECULATE ON WHETHER YOU WANT TO

02:21:22.207 --> 02:21:23.575 region:rollup2
WAIT FOR THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION

02:21:23.408 --> 02:21:25.644 region:rollup2
OR.

02:21:23.575 --> 02:21:29.648 region:rollup2
.

02:21:25.644 --> 02:21:30.949 region:rollup2
OR ARE TESTED WITH THIS ONE.

02:21:29.648 --> 02:21:32.517 region:rollup2
BRENDA GUESS I WOULD ADD TO THE

02:21:30.949 --> 02:21:33.819 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT. YOU KNOW AS I'VE

02:21:32.517 --> 02:21:36.755 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

02:21:33.819 --> 02:21:38.223 region:rollup2
C. M. A MAIS AUTHORITY IS IS.

02:21:36.755 --> 02:21:40.659 region:rollup2
TO SOME EXTENT PRETTY BROAD.

02:21:38.223 --> 02:21:42.594 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU WERE INTERESTED AND

02:21:40.659 --> 02:21:45.030 region:rollup2
PERHAPS PURSUING SOME

02:21:42.594 --> 02:21:47.566 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES WITHIN THE EXISTING

02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:49.101 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY OF CMMI THAT MAY LAY

02:21:47.566 --> 02:21:51.636 region:rollup2
THE GROUNDWORK FOR EXAMPLE ALL

02:21:49.101 --> 02:21:53.638 region:rollup2
PAYER REFORM. THAT MIGHT GET YOU

02:21:51.636 --> 02:21:54.973 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE PATH TOWARDS

02:21:53.638 --> 02:21:56.508 region:rollup2
A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THE NOT

02:21:54.973 --> 02:21:59.611 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY THERE.

02:21:56.508 --> 02:22:01.546 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME.

02:21:59.611 --> 02:22:03.715 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LEAD TIME TO DO SOME

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:04.783 region:rollup2
OF THE OTHER PLANNING THAT MIGHT

02:22:03.715 --> 02:22:06.885 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE DONE FOR A MORE

02:22:04.783 --> 02:22:08.320 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE STATE BASED SINGLE

02:22:06.885 --> 02:22:10.589 region:rollup2
PAYER SYSTEM.

02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:12.023 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS YOU'RE

02:22:10.589 --> 02:22:13.358 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA FIND AS MUCH OF A

02:22:12.023 --> 02:22:14.526 region:rollup2
FRIENDLY AUDIENCE WITH THE

02:22:13.358 --> 02:22:15.560 region:rollup2
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION BUT YOU

02:22:14.526 --> 02:22:17.029 region:rollup2
WOULD. IN A FUTURE

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:18.764 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

02:22:17.029 --> 02:22:21.299 region:rollup2
IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE

02:22:18.764 --> 02:22:22.667 region:rollup2
INNOVATION CENTER IS SEEKING YOU

02:22:21.299 --> 02:22:24.870 region:rollup2
KNOW PROPOSAL'S UNDERNEATH AND

02:22:22.667 --> 02:22:26.805 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION.

02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:27.973 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT

02:22:26.805 --> 02:22:29.374 region:rollup2
COULD BE SOMETHING.

02:22:27.973 --> 02:22:31.643 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PURSUE

02:22:29.374 --> 02:22:33.044 region:rollup2
OR MORE TESTING WITHIN THE STATE

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:35.213 region:rollup2
INNOVATION MODELS.

02:22:33.044 --> 02:22:37.015 region:rollup2
CATEGORY AND THERE ARE THOSE

02:22:35.213 --> 02:22:39.251 region:rollup2
AVENUES THAT YOU COULD PURSUE

02:22:37.015 --> 02:22:41.086 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF JUST HOLDING OFF

02:22:39.251 --> 02:22:42.354 region:rollup2
APPLYING FOR ANYTHING. DOING

02:22:41.086 --> 02:22:44.189 region:rollup2
THINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:22:42.354 --> 02:22:45.390 region:rollup2
INCREMENTALLY MY.

02:22:44.189 --> 02:22:47.726 region:rollup2
MIGHT HELP.

02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:48.527 region:rollup2
GET YOU SOMEWHERE DOWN DOWN THE

02:22:47.726 --> 02:22:50.695 region:rollup2
ROAD TOWARDS

02:22:48.527 --> 02:22:52.330 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE END GOAL.

02:22:50.695 --> 02:22:54.132 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT JUST FALL BELOW BUT

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:56.068 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CONVENTIONAL PUBLIC

02:22:54.132 --> 02:22:57.669 region:rollup2
WISDOM IS OR CONVENTIONAL

02:22:56.068 --> 02:22:59.171 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS THAT WE

02:22:57.669 --> 02:23:01.440 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO GET WAIVERS FROM

02:22:59.171 --> 02:23:02.074 region:rollup2
AND A PRESIDENTIAL MINISTRATION

02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:04.209 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE LAYING

02:23:02.074 --> 02:23:04.776 region:rollup2
OUT HERE IS. AND MANY INSTANCES

02:23:04.209 --> 02:23:05.844 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:23:04.776 --> 02:23:07.779 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER

02:23:05.844 --> 02:23:09.648 region:rollup2
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL SO IT'S

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:10.882 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST SUPPORT FROM THE

02:23:09.648 --> 02:23:12.284 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE BRANCH FEDERALLY ITS

02:23:10.882 --> 02:23:14.453 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

02:23:12.284 --> 02:23:16.121 region:rollup2
BRANCH AND AND CONGRESS. ON THAT

02:23:14.453 --> 02:23:17.889 region:rollup2
BUT IN YOUR IN YOUR PRESENTATION

02:23:16.121 --> 02:23:19.658 region:rollup2
YOU SAY THAT AS LONG AS THE

02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:20.926 region:rollup2
MEDICARE CHANGES ARE ORIENTED

02:23:19.658 --> 02:23:22.294 region:rollup2
AROUND IMPROVING QUALITY OR

02:23:20.926 --> 02:23:25.230 region:rollup2
SPENDING REDUCING SPENDING A

02:23:22.294 --> 02:23:26.698 region:rollup2
MEDICARE. IT'S A FAIRLY BROAD.

02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:27.365 region:rollup2
DEFINITION BUT THEN YOU ALSO SEE

02:23:26.698 --> 02:23:27.933 region:rollup2
BROADER CHANGES WOULD BE NEEDED

02:23:27.365 --> 02:23:29.901 region:rollup2
FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A

02:23:27.933 --> 02:23:32.471 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM

02:23:29.901 --> 02:23:32.737 region:rollup2
COULD WE DEFINE A PILOT LIKE

02:23:32.471 --> 02:23:34.439 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR.

02:23:32.737 --> 02:23:35.707 region:rollup2
.

02:23:34.439 --> 02:23:36.641 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT SINGLE

02:23:35.707 --> 02:23:38.176 region:rollup2
PAYER COULD LOOK LIKE IN

02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:40.078 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND HAVE THAT.

02:23:38.176 --> 02:23:41.379 region:rollup2
BE CONSIDERED UNDER THIS BROAD

02:23:40.078 --> 02:23:42.948 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF WHAT WOULD COME

02:23:41.379 --> 02:23:44.249 region:rollup2
UNDER MEDICARE WAIVER OR YOUR

02:23:42.948 --> 02:23:45.150 region:rollup2
YOU THINK THAT IT'S HOW YOU

02:23:44.249 --> 02:23:46.585 region:rollup2
SLICE IT AND DICE IT YOU REALLY

02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:48.653 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED CONGRESSIONAL.

02:23:46.585 --> 02:23:50.422 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I BUT

02:23:48.653 --> 02:23:51.990 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST BE A LITTLE BIT

02:23:50.422 --> 02:23:54.593 region:rollup2
CAUTIOUS ABOUT.

02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:56.394 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE PILOT IN TERMS OF

02:23:54.593 --> 02:23:58.530 region:rollup2
HOW YOU'RE CHANGING.

02:23:56.394 --> 02:24:00.332 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IN MEDICARE OR

02:23:58.530 --> 02:24:02.267 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE OR COST

02:24:00.332 --> 02:24:04.102 region:rollup2
SHARING FOR EXAMPLE THOSE THINGS

02:24:02.267 --> 02:24:05.604 region:rollup2
ARE ALL SPECIFIED IN STATUTE.

02:24:04.102 --> 02:24:07.005 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO WAIVER AUTHORITY

02:24:05.604 --> 02:24:08.907 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS STATES TO CHANGE

02:24:07.005 --> 02:24:11.576 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS.

02:24:08.907 --> 02:24:13.311 region:rollup2
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU

02:24:11.576 --> 02:24:15.547 region:rollup2
WANTED TO YOU KNOW.

02:24:13.311 --> 02:24:17.182 region:rollup2
MAKE PEOPLE ON MEDICARE.

02:24:15.547 --> 02:24:20.252 region:rollup2
HOLE IN TERMS OF NOT PAYING ANY

02:24:17.182 --> 02:24:22.854 region:rollup2
COST SHARING OR PREMIUMS.

02:24:20.252 --> 02:24:24.723 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS ARE ALLOWED TO BE

02:24:22.854 --> 02:24:26.091 region:rollup2
CHANGED BY STATES EVEN IF IT

02:24:24.723 --> 02:24:27.826 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GREAT FOR A PATIENT

02:24:26.091 --> 02:24:28.326 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE. THOSE THINGS ARE

02:24:27.826 --> 02:24:30.428 region:rollup2
KIND OF SPECIFIED IN THE

02:24:28.326 --> 02:24:32.664 region:rollup2
STATUTE.

02:24:30.428 --> 02:24:34.666 region:rollup2
IT AND THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE

02:24:32.664 --> 02:24:35.867 region:rollup2
BEFORE SO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY

02:24:34.666 --> 02:24:38.236 region:rollup2
CLEAR TO ME THAT THE FEDERAL

02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:40.138 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WOULD SAY NO BUT YOU

02:24:38.236 --> 02:24:41.907 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE TO BE VERY SPECIFIC

02:24:40.138 --> 02:24:43.642 region:rollup2
AND DEFINING YOUR GOALS. AND

02:24:41.907 --> 02:24:45.243 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATING OVER THE COURSE OF

02:24:43.642 --> 02:24:46.611 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE WAIVER PERIOD IS

02:24:45.243 --> 02:24:48.446 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:49.848 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY REFER GUARD TO

02:24:48.446 --> 02:24:52.017 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SAVINGS.

02:24:49.848 --> 02:24:53.585 region:rollup2
AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

02:24:52.017 --> 02:24:55.320 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW I THINK YOU CAN

02:24:53.585 --> 02:24:56.655 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY TRY TO BE AS CREATIVE

02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.791 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE.

02:24:56.655 --> 02:25:02.494 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN IT COMES BACK TO IT'S

02:24:59.791 --> 02:25:03.094 region:rollup2
A WAY FOR ITS TIME OMITTED IT'S

02:25:02.494 --> 02:25:05.297 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:25:03.094 --> 02:25:07.699 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO BE A

02:25:05.297 --> 02:25:09.467 region:rollup2
PERMANENT CHANGE TO THE MEDICARE

02:25:07.699 --> 02:25:10.735 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IT'S DESIGNED TO BE A

02:25:09.467 --> 02:25:12.604 region:rollup2
PERMANENT CHANGE TO THE STATE'S

02:25:10.735 --> 02:25:14.105 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE

02:25:12.604 --> 02:25:15.907 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST IS

02:25:14.105 --> 02:25:17.142 region:rollup2
IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

02:25:15.907 --> 02:25:17.642 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THAT WILL BE THE

02:25:17.142 --> 02:25:19.144 region:rollup2
LENS THROUGH WHICH THEY

02:25:17.642 --> 02:25:20.679 region:rollup2
EVALUATE.

02:25:19.144 --> 02:25:23.582 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE STATE.

02:25:20.679 --> 02:25:24.182 region:rollup2
PROPOSES TO DO AND WITH REGARD

02:25:23.582 --> 02:25:27.152 region:rollup2
TO A PILOT OR SOME OTHER TYPE

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:28.787 region:rollup2
OF.

02:25:27.152 --> 02:25:29.654 region:rollup2
I'M CHINA. INTERNET LISTEN TO

02:25:28.787 --> 02:25:32.757 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WONDERING

02:25:29.654 --> 02:25:36.127 region:rollup2
AGAIN IF WE PROPOSED A PILOT. UP

02:25:32.757 --> 02:25:38.229 region:rollup2
THAT CHANGED HOW MEDICARE.

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:40.699 region:rollup2
SPENDING WAS REDUCED OR QUALITY

02:25:38.229 --> 02:25:42.033 region:rollup2
IMPROVED AND AND AND SAID OUR

02:25:40.699 --> 02:25:42.901 region:rollup2
INTENT IS TO OBVIOUSLY DO

02:25:42.033 --> 02:25:44.302 region:rollup2
SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT BUT FOR

02:25:42.901 --> 02:25:46.237 region:rollup2
NOW WILL BRING INTO A FIGHTER

02:25:44.302 --> 02:25:48.807 region:rollup2
PILOT SURE. AND I AM YEAH AND I

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:49.741 region:rollup2
THINK THAT CMS DOES ENVISION

02:25:48.807 --> 02:25:51.543 region:rollup2
THAT TYPE OF MEDICARE

02:25:49.741 --> 02:25:53.745 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN THE STATE

02:25:51.543 --> 02:25:55.480 region:rollup2
INNOVATION MODELS.

02:25:53.745 --> 02:25:56.915 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE WITH WITHIN THE

02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:58.049 region:rollup2
INNOVATION CENTER SO I WOULD

02:25:56.915 --> 02:25:59.150 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY

02:25:58.049 --> 02:26:01.820 region:rollup2
TO CONNECT YOU WITH MORE

02:25:59.150 --> 02:26:04.055 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SO THAT YOU CAN SEE.

02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:06.257 region:rollup2
HOW ON THE ONE HAND?

02:26:04.055 --> 02:26:07.993 region:rollup2
THE INNOVATION CENTER IS

02:26:06.257 --> 02:26:10.161 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING THAT THIS TYPE OF

02:26:07.993 --> 02:26:11.529 region:rollup2
IDEA AND ON THE OTHER HAND HOLD

02:26:10.161 --> 02:26:14.065 region:rollup2
STATES UP TO A VERY HIGH

02:26:11.529 --> 02:26:15.133 region:rollup2
STANDARD WITH REGARD TO MEDICARE

02:26:14.065 --> 02:26:17.369 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION.

02:26:15.133 --> 02:26:19.437 region:rollup2
IN STATE INNOVATION MODELS.

02:26:17.369 --> 02:26:20.438 region:rollup2
AND I AND I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:22.440 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

02:26:20.438 --> 02:26:23.808 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES THAT THEY USE TO

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:25.443 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THE DIFFERENCE STATE

02:26:23.808 --> 02:26:27.345 region:rollup2
INNOVATION MODELS WITH REGARD TO

02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:28.947 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PARTICIPATION. BUT I

02:26:27.345 --> 02:26:31.416 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT YOU BASICALLY NEED TO

02:26:28.947 --> 02:26:33.451 region:rollup2
KNOW IS THAT WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE

02:26:31.416 --> 02:26:33.618 region:rollup2
YOU CAN PROPOSE THIS TYPE OF.

02:26:33.451 --> 02:26:35.253 region:rollup2
OF.

02:26:33.618 --> 02:26:36.855 region:rollup2
PILOT TEST

02:26:35.253 --> 02:26:38.356 region:rollup2
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NO GUARANTEE

02:26:36.855 --> 02:26:41.326 region:rollup2
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL

02:26:38.356 --> 02:26:41.960 region:rollup2
APPROVE IT SO IT LEAVES YOU TO

02:26:41.326 --> 02:26:44.296 region:rollup2
SOME EXTENT.

02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:45.830 region:rollup2
AT YOU KNOW AT THEIR MY HALF

02:26:44.296 --> 02:26:48.433 region:rollup2
THEIR MERCY IF YOU WELL.

02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:50.201 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD AND

02:26:48.433 --> 02:26:51.302 region:rollup2
JUST A BUT I GUESS STATISTICALLY

02:26:50.201 --> 02:26:51.936 region:rollup2
HOW OFTEN ARE MEDICARE MEDICAID

02:26:51.302 --> 02:26:54.406 region:rollup2
WAIVERS

02:26:51.936 --> 02:26:57.375 region:rollup2
A TONIGHT.

02:26:54.406 --> 02:26:58.910 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT NUMBER OF NO I

02:26:57.375 --> 02:27:00.078 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT PLAYED ON THE

02:26:58.910 --> 02:27:01.746 region:rollup2
MEDICARE SIDE OF LOOKED INTO

02:27:00.078 --> 02:27:03.048 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY A LOT OF THE

02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:04.316 region:rollup2
MEDICARE WAIVERS WERE

02:27:03.048 --> 02:27:06.718 region:rollup2
CONGRESSIONALLY.

02:27:04.316 --> 02:27:08.420 region:rollup2
EITHER CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED

02:27:06.718 --> 02:27:10.021 region:rollup2
SO THEY THEY HAD TO HAPPEN.

02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:11.856 region:rollup2
OR CMS.

02:27:10.021 --> 02:27:13.325 region:rollup2
UNDERTOOK THEM OF THEIR OWN

02:27:11.856 --> 02:27:15.093 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE

02:27:13.325 --> 02:27:16.027 region:rollup2
SO THEY ALSO KIND OF HAD TO

02:27:15.093 --> 02:27:17.696 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BECAUSE THE EN MASSE WAS

02:27:16.027 --> 02:27:20.365 region:rollup2
RUNNING THEM.

02:27:17.696 --> 02:27:22.267 region:rollup2
SO ON THE MEDICARE SIDE.

02:27:20.365 --> 02:27:24.369 region:rollup2
IT HASN'T HISTORICALLY BEEN THE

02:27:22.267 --> 02:27:26.404 region:rollup2
CASE THAT THEY'RE DENIED BECAUSE

02:27:24.369 --> 02:27:28.740 region:rollup2
THE VIEW OF THE ENTITIES THAT

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:29.941 region:rollup2
ARE INITIATING THEIR WAY FURTHER

02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:31.543 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATION IS THE FEDERAL

02:27:29.941 --> 02:27:32.410 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ITSELF. IT'S

02:27:31.543 --> 02:27:33.745 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ON THE MEDICAID

02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:36.181 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ON THE MEDICAID SIDE

02:27:33.745 --> 02:27:38.083 region:rollup2
AND I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW I DON'T

02:27:36.181 --> 02:27:39.551 region:rollup2
KNOW IF THAT STATISTIC IS KNOWN

02:27:38.083 --> 02:27:40.618 region:rollup2
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO TELL

02:27:39.551 --> 02:27:42.187 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE THAT.

02:27:40.618 --> 02:27:43.755 region:rollup2
THEN IF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE

02:27:42.187 --> 02:27:45.256 region:rollup2
GOING THE WAY THE STATE ONCE

02:27:43.755 --> 02:27:46.991 region:rollup2
THEY MAY WITHDRAW THAT WAIVER IS

02:27:45.256 --> 02:27:47.359 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE OF WHAT THE FEDERAL

02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:48.793 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT SAID.

02:27:47.359 --> 02:27:50.495 region:rollup2
.

02:27:48.793 --> 02:27:52.330 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL

02:27:50.495 --> 02:27:53.998 region:rollup2
WORSE SEEING THIS A LITTLE BIT

02:27:52.330 --> 02:27:54.599 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWOS

02:27:53.998 --> 02:27:55.600 region:rollup2
WHERE SOME OF THE STATES HAVE

02:27:54.599 --> 02:27:57.102 region:rollup2
PULLED BACK.

02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:58.503 region:rollup2
I'M SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE

02:27:57.102 --> 02:28:01.106 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY DENY

02:27:58.503 --> 02:28:01.940 region:rollup2
THEM ONE WAS DEEMED INCOMPLETE.

02:28:01.106 --> 02:28:05.410 region:rollup2
THINK VERY MUCH.

02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:05.944 region:rollup2

02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:10.882 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH A

FIGURE.

02:28:10.882 --> 02:28:14.686 region:rollup2
NEXT I'D LIKE TO HAVE.

02:28:11.850 --> 02:28:16.154 region:rollup2
BE ENTIRE PANEL OF SCOTT GRAVES

IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING.

02:29:04.202 --> 02:29:07.705 region:rollup2
SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO TODAY.

02:29:06.271 --> 02:29:10.008 region:rollup2
OR THIS AFTERNOON.

02:29:07.705 --> 02:29:11.709 region:rollup2
IS TO TRY TO MAINTAIN YOUR

02:29:10.008 --> 02:29:13.878 region:rollup2
INTEREST FOR A FEW MINUTES IN

02:29:11.709 --> 02:29:15.146 region:rollup2
OUR STATE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE I

02:29:13.878 --> 02:29:16.047 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:17.315 region:rollup2
EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND

02:29:16.047 --> 02:29:18.483 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:29:17.315 --> 02:29:20.218 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

02:29:18.483 --> 02:29:22.687 region:rollup2
THAT EFFORTS TO MOVE CALIFORNIA

02:29:20.218 --> 02:29:24.556 region:rollup2
TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

02:29:22.687 --> 02:29:26.891 region:rollup2
WOULD ENTAIL CONSTRAINTS THAT

02:29:24.556 --> 02:29:29.227 region:rollup2
ARE BUILT IN OUGHT TO OUR STATE

02:29:26.891 --> 02:29:30.695 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION SO IT'S IMPORTANT

02:29:29.227 --> 02:29:31.896 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND OUT WHAT THOSE

02:29:30.695 --> 02:29:34.332 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINTS ARE.

02:29:31.896 --> 02:29:37.635 region:rollup2
AND HOW THE STATE MAY BE ABLE

02:29:34.332 --> 02:29:39.604 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THEM.

02:29:37.635 --> 02:29:41.139 region:rollup2
SO ONE STARTING POINT FOR

02:29:39.604 --> 02:29:42.474 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT MOVING TOWARD

02:29:41.139 --> 02:29:43.374 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA

02:29:42.474 --> 02:29:45.610 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

02:29:43.374 --> 02:29:47.612 region:rollup2
SUCH COVERAGE WOULD VERY LIKELY

02:29:45.610 --> 02:29:48.279 region:rollup2
REQUIRE TAX INCREASES I GUESS

02:29:47.612 --> 02:29:49.581 region:rollup2
YOU COULD THINK THERE WOULD BE A

02:29:48.279 --> 02:29:52.350 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:29:49.581 --> 02:29:54.319 region:rollup2
CUT HERE OR THERE AND USE THAT

02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:55.687 region:rollup2
SPENDING EXISTING EXPENDITURES

02:29:54.319 --> 02:29:57.488 region:rollup2
TO FIND UNIFORMS WENT UNIVERSAL

02:29:55.687 --> 02:29:58.890 region:rollup2
COVERAGE. WHAT'S MORE LIKELY IS

02:29:57.488 --> 02:30:00.525 region:rollup2
THAT A TAX INCREASE WOULD BE

02:29:58.890 --> 02:30:01.826 region:rollup2
REQUIRED AND IN FACT PRIOR

02:30:00.525 --> 02:30:02.894 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES HAVE SHOWN THAT FOR

02:30:01.826 --> 02:30:05.997 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE MOVING TOWARD A SINGLE

02:30:02.894 --> 02:30:07.465 region:rollup2
PAYER SYSTEM. COULD ENTAIL A TAX

02:30:05.997 --> 02:30:08.466 region:rollup2
INCREASE OF WELL OVER ONE

02:30:07.465 --> 02:30:10.001 region:rollup2
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS AND I

02:30:08.466 --> 02:30:11.035 region:rollup2
BELIEVE OF THE LEGISLATIVE

02:30:10.001 --> 02:30:13.071 region:rollup2
ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL BE

02:30:11.035 --> 02:30:13.972 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATING THAT I'M IN A FEW

02:30:13.071 --> 02:30:17.041 region:rollup2
MOMENTS.

02:30:13.972 --> 02:30:18.076 region:rollup2
SO TAX INCREASES ARE POSSIBLE

02:30:17.041 --> 02:30:20.345 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THE

02:30:18.076 --> 02:30:21.679 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CAN MUSTER A TWO

02:30:20.345 --> 02:30:23.715 region:rollup2
THIRDS VOTE OF EACH CHAMBER.

02:30:21.679 --> 02:30:24.515 region:rollup2
HARM BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE

02:30:23.715 --> 02:30:25.917 region:rollup2
ARE PROVISIONS WITHIN THE

02:30:24.515 --> 02:30:27.752 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION.

02:30:25.917 --> 02:30:29.387 region:rollup2
THAT CONSTRAIN THE

02:30:27.752 --> 02:30:33.057 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY.

02:30:29.387 --> 02:30:35.293 region:rollup2
TO RAISE TAXES AND TO DEDICATE

02:30:33.057 --> 02:30:37.929 region:rollup2
THE REVENUES TO PARTICULAR

02:30:35.293 --> 02:30:39.230 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OKAY JUST RATHER THAN

02:30:37.929 --> 02:30:40.365 region:rollup2
I'M ALLOWING THEM TO FLOW INTO

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:41.766 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND SO WHAT I

02:30:40.365 --> 02:30:42.834 region:rollup2
WANTED TO DO TODAY IS TO TALK

02:30:41.766 --> 02:30:44.969 region:rollup2
ABOUT A COUPLE PROVISIONS IN

02:30:42.834 --> 02:30:46.871 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR. ONE YOU ARE VERY

02:30:44.969 --> 02:30:48.239 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH PROPOSITION NINETY

02:30:46.871 --> 02:30:49.407 region:rollup2
EIGHT APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN

02:30:48.239 --> 02:30:52.010 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT.

02:30:49.407 --> 02:30:53.044 region:rollup2
WHICH AMENDED ARTICLE SIXTEEN

02:30:52.010 --> 02:30:54.913 region:rollup2
SECTION EIGHT OF THE STATE

02:30:53.044 --> 02:30:56.748 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION I'M AND WAS LATER

02:30:54.913 --> 02:30:58.750 region:rollup2
AMENDED BY PROPER LEVIN OF

02:30:56.748 --> 02:30:59.951 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY. I'M A SECOND

02:30:58.750 --> 02:31:01.653 region:rollup2
PROVISION THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY

02:30:59.951 --> 02:31:03.721 region:rollup2
LESS FAMILIAR WITH AT LEAST UP

02:31:01.653 --> 02:31:04.322 region:rollup2
UNTIL THIS YEAR AMEND MAYBE LAST

02:31:03.721 --> 02:31:06.691 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:31:04.322 --> 02:31:09.560 region:rollup2
IS PROP FOUR OF NINETEEN

02:31:06.691 --> 02:31:11.563 region:rollup2
SEVENTY NINE WHICH ADDED ARTICLE

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:14.432 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN BE TO THE STATE

02:31:11.563 --> 02:31:16.134 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION AND ITSELF WAS

02:31:14.432 --> 02:31:18.803 region:rollup2
LATER AMENDED BOTH BY PROP

02:31:16.134 --> 02:31:19.704 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT AS WELL AS BY PROP

02:31:18.803 --> 02:31:20.104 region:rollup2
ONE ELEVEN.

02:31:19.704 --> 02:31:21.406 region:rollup2
SO.

02:31:20.104 --> 02:31:21.839 region:rollup2
ARTICLE THIRTEEN BE ESSENTIALLY

02:31:21.406 --> 02:31:22.807 region:rollup2
IS THE GANG LIMIT.

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:24.108 region:rollup2
AND I'LL BE GETTING INTO BOTH

02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:27.879 region:rollup2
OF THOSE ISSUES.

02:31:24.108 --> 02:31:28.579 region:rollup2
IN A MOMENT.

02:31:27.879 --> 02:31:30.315 region:rollup2
SO.

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:31.449 region:rollup2
I CAN HAPPILY REPORT THAT I'M

02:31:30.315 --> 02:31:33.117 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE GETTING INTO THE

02:31:31.449 --> 02:31:34.953 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITIES THE MECHANICS THE

02:31:33.117 --> 02:31:36.487 region:rollup2
FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

02:31:34.953 --> 02:31:38.256 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OF

02:31:36.487 --> 02:31:39.891 region:rollup2
MINIMUM FUNDING GUARANTEE I WILL

02:31:38.256 --> 02:31:41.559 region:rollup2
JUST REMIND I'M ALL OF US IN THE

02:31:39.891 --> 02:31:43.227 region:rollup2
ROOM. THAT IT ESSENTIALLY

02:31:41.559 --> 02:31:45.663 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A MECHANISM ON FOR

02:31:43.227 --> 02:31:48.299 region:rollup2
PROVIDING EACH YEAR A GUARANTEED

02:31:45.663 --> 02:31:50.468 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF FUNDING TO K. TWELVE

02:31:48.299 --> 02:31:52.303 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:53.571 region:rollup2
I'M ALSO KNOWN AS K. FOURTEEN

02:31:52.303 --> 02:31:55.540 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

02:31:53.571 --> 02:31:56.307 region:rollup2
SO THE KEY ISSUE HERE RELATED TO

02:31:55.540 --> 02:31:57.709 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE IS

02:31:56.307 --> 02:32:00.211 region:rollup2
THIS

02:31:57.709 --> 02:32:02.780 region:rollup2
WOOD CAPE FOURTEEN EDUCATION BE

02:32:00.211 --> 02:32:05.049 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO RECEIVE A PORTION OF

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:06.918 region:rollup2
ANY TAX REVENUES.

02:32:05.049 --> 02:32:08.786 region:rollup2
RAISED TO FIND UNIVERSAL

02:32:06.918 --> 02:32:10.922 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

02:32:08.786 --> 02:32:13.825 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED

02:32:10.922 --> 02:32:16.227 region:rollup2
TO DIRECT THOSE REVENUES INTO A

02:32:13.825 --> 02:32:17.562 region:rollup2
SPECIAL FUND RATHER THAN INTO

02:32:16.227 --> 02:32:19.797 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND THAT IS

02:32:17.562 --> 02:32:21.499 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THE KEY QUESTION.

02:32:19.797 --> 02:32:23.301 region:rollup2
ARM AROUND HOW PROPOSITION

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:24.869 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT RELATES TO THE

02:32:23.301 --> 02:32:29.674 region:rollup2
STATE'S OF EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE

02:32:24.869 --> 02:32:31.409 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

02:32:29.674 --> 02:32:33.244 region:rollup2
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW IS

02:32:31.409 --> 02:32:34.078 region:rollup2
SPEAK FROM THIS VERY SIMPLE

02:32:33.244 --> 02:32:36.781 region:rollup2
GRAPHIC HERE.

02:32:34.078 --> 02:32:38.049 region:rollup2
TO LAY OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES.

02:32:36.781 --> 02:32:40.018 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PRESENT.

02:32:38.049 --> 02:32:41.819 region:rollup2
IN VARIOUS DEBATES AROUND

02:32:40.018 --> 02:32:43.287 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SO THE

02:32:41.819 --> 02:32:44.956 region:rollup2
FIRST THING TO UNDERSTAND IS

02:32:43.287 --> 02:32:46.391 region:rollup2
THAT IN ARTICLE SIXTEEN SECTION

02:32:44.956 --> 02:32:48.626 region:rollup2
<u><c.blue>IGHT.</c></u>

02:32:46.391 --> 02:32:50.762 region:rollup2
ARE THE TERM A GENERAL FUND

02:32:48.626 --> 02:32:53.431 region:rollup2
REVENUES IS USE THE TERM GENERAL

02:32:50.762 --> 02:32:55.199 region:rollup2
FUND PROCEEDS OF TAXES IS USED

02:32:53.431 --> 02:32:57.268 region:rollup2
WHEN TALKING ABOUT HOW THE PROP

02:32:55.199 --> 02:32:58.870 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE GETS

02:32:57.268 --> 02:33:01.105 region:rollup2
CALCULATED EACH YEAR. THE

02:32:58.870 --> 02:33:03.541 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION DOES NOT TALK

02:33:01.105 --> 02:33:04.609 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SPECIAL FUND

02:33:03.541 --> 02:33:07.245 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

02:33:04.609 --> 02:33:09.013 region:rollup2
IN IN HAPPENED IN DISCUSSING

02:33:07.245 --> 02:33:10.548 region:rollup2
ARE DESCRIBING HOW THE PROP

02:33:09.013 --> 02:33:13.084 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT CALCULATIONS ARE

02:33:10.548 --> 02:33:15.219 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO BE DONE. SO. THERE

02:33:13.084 --> 02:33:17.522 region:rollup2
ARE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS.

02:33:15.219 --> 02:33:18.523 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS ONE

02:33:17.522 --> 02:33:20.458 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION.

02:33:18.523 --> 02:33:22.427 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT CALL IT THE STRONG

02:33:20.458 --> 02:33:24.429 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION ARGUES THAT

02:33:22.427 --> 02:33:26.197 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SPECIAL FUND REVENUES

02:33:24.429 --> 02:33:28.566 region:rollup2
ARE NOT MENTIONED.

02:33:26.197 --> 02:33:30.168 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION IN

02:33:28.566 --> 02:33:31.969 region:rollup2
THE CONTEXT OF NINETY EIGHT. AND

02:33:30.168 --> 02:33:33.671 region:rollup2
BECAUSE GENERAL FUND REVENUES

02:33:31.969 --> 02:33:36.040 region:rollup2
AND SPECIAL FUND REVENUES.

02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:38.209 region:rollup2
ARE DISTINCT FROM ONE ANOTHER

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:40.778 region:rollup2
THEN SPECIAL FUND REVENUES WOULD

02:33:38.209 --> 02:33:42.113 region:rollup2
NEVER COUNT IN CALCULATING THE

02:33:40.778 --> 02:33:43.781 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:33:42.113 --> 02:33:45.149 region:rollup2
SPENDING GUARANTEE SO ONE

02:33:43.781 --> 02:33:47.151 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS COULD WORK.

02:33:45.149 --> 02:33:49.053 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS A TAX

02:33:47.151 --> 02:33:50.421 region:rollup2
INCREASE INTENDED TO ACHIEVE

02:33:49.053 --> 02:33:52.090 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

02:33:50.421 --> 02:33:54.125 region:rollup2
IT COULD DIRECT THOSE REVENUES

02:33:52.090 --> 02:33:55.860 region:rollup2
INTO A SPECIAL FUND.

02:33:54.125 --> 02:33:57.662 region:rollup2
AND IT COULD PERMANENTLY EXCLUDE

02:33:55.860 --> 02:33:59.831 region:rollup2
THOSE REVENUES FROM THE

02:33:57.662 --> 02:34:02.300 region:rollup2
CALCULATION OF THE PROPOSITION

02:33:59.831 --> 02:34:04.035 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE EACH YEAR

02:34:02.300 --> 02:34:05.737 region:rollup2
WHICHWOULD EFFECTIVELY MAIN

02:34:04.035 --> 02:34:08.473 region:rollup2
THAT K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION WOULD

02:34:05.737 --> 02:34:10.374 region:rollup2
DERIVE NO UP FINANCIAL BENEFIT

02:34:08.473 --> 02:34:12.577 region:rollup2
FROM THE REVENUES REYES TO

02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:14.045 region:rollup2
SUPPORT. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

02:34:12.577 --> 02:34:15.346 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ONE VEHICLE OUT AND

02:34:14.045 --> 02:34:17.081 region:rollup2
THAT VIEW WAS EXPRESSED IN A

02:34:15.346 --> 02:34:18.416 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT VERY CLEARLY BY THE

02:34:17.081 --> 02:34:19.951 region:rollup2
BROWN ADMINISTRATION IT WAS A

02:34:18.416 --> 02:34:20.985 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT THAT WAS BROUGHT IN TWO

02:34:19.951 --> 02:34:22.487 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWELVE.

02:34:20.985 --> 02:34:24.188 region:rollup2
GOT BY K. TWELVE SCHOOL

02:34:22.487 --> 02:34:25.823 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS IN THE WAKE OF THE TWO

02:34:24.188 --> 02:34:27.558 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT IN

02:34:25.823 --> 02:34:28.926 region:rollup2
WHICH THE STATE SHIFTED VARIOUS

02:34:27.558 --> 02:34:30.194 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO THE

02:34:28.926 --> 02:34:31.729 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ALONG WITH BILLIONS OF

02:34:30.194 --> 02:34:32.864 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

02:34:31.729 --> 02:34:34.665 region:rollup2
NEWS THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE

02:34:32.864 --> 02:34:37.802 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND REVENUES.

02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:39.270 region:rollup2
BUT WERE SORT OF RE IMAGINED AS

02:34:37.802 --> 02:34:41.839 region:rollup2
SPECIAL FUND REVENUES.

02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:43.274 region:rollup2
THAT LAWSUIT WAS LATER MOVED

02:34:41.839 --> 02:34:44.509 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PROPOSITION THIRTY

02:34:43.274 --> 02:34:46.277 region:rollup2
PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE

02:34:44.509 --> 02:34:48.045 region:rollup2
WHICH ESSENTIALLY GAVE K.

02:34:46.277 --> 02:34:49.580 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN EDUCATION BACK THE

02:34:48.045 --> 02:34:51.015 region:rollup2
REVENUES THAT WERE LOST AS A

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:52.250 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THAT TRANSFERS OF THE

02:34:51.015 --> 02:34:54.185 region:rollup2
WAS NEVER ANY CONTROLLING

02:34:52.250 --> 02:34:55.319 region:rollup2
DECISION. THEY CAME OUT OF THAT

02:34:54.185 --> 02:34:57.522 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT SO THAT'S THE FIRST

02:34:55.319 --> 02:34:59.524 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION THERE ON THE LEFT

02:34:57.522 --> 02:35:00.525 region:rollup2
UP LOOKING DOWN AT THE OTHER BOX

02:34:59.524 --> 02:35:02.126 region:rollup2
ON THE BOTTOM THE ONE ON THE

02:35:00.525 --> 02:35:04.095 region:rollup2
RIGHT. THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER

02:35:02.126 --> 02:35:05.596 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF HOW TO THINK

02:35:04.095 --> 02:35:07.532 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

02:35:05.596 --> 02:35:09.167 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND I

02:35:07.532 --> 02:35:11.402 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND IN SPECIAL FUND

02:35:09.167 --> 02:35:14.205 region:rollup2
REVENUES IN THIS INTERPRETATION.

02:35:11.402 --> 02:35:16.407 region:rollup2
SORT OF ARGUES THAT THE GENERAL

02:35:14.205 --> 02:35:17.742 region:rollup2
FUND AS USED IN THE CONSTITUTION

02:35:16.407 --> 02:35:19.944 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF MORE

02:35:17.742 --> 02:35:22.413 region:rollup2
BROADLY TO ENCOMPASS REVENUES

02:35:19.944 --> 02:35:24.081 region:rollup2
THAT GO BEYOND THOSE THAT ARE

02:35:22.413 --> 02:35:26.784 region:rollup2
DEPOSITED INTO THE STATE'S

02:35:24.081 --> 02:35:29.253 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND. EACH YEAR BY STATE

02:35:26.784 --> 02:35:31.856 region:rollup2
LAW ARE AS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW

02:35:29.253 --> 02:35:32.890 region:rollup2
SO THIS INTERPRETATION SHOWS UP

02:35:31.856 --> 02:35:34.992 region:rollup2
FROM TIME TO TIME WITHIN THE

02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:36.227 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IT WAS EXPRESSED IN

02:35:34.992 --> 02:35:37.795 region:rollup2
THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS

02:35:36.227 --> 02:35:40.398 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IS ANALYSIS OF SENATE

02:35:37.795 --> 02:35:41.632 region:rollup2
BILL FIVE SIXTY TWO. WHICH AIM

02:35:40.398 --> 02:35:43.734 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM

02:35:41.632 --> 02:35:45.736 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA SO IT WAS VERY

02:35:43.734 --> 02:35:47.738 region:rollup2
CLEARLY EXPRESS THEIR. IT IT HAS

02:35:45.736 --> 02:35:49.240 region:rollup2
ALSO BEEN IMPLIED IN A NUMBER OF

02:35:47.738 --> 02:35:50.908 region:rollup2
BALLOT MEASURES THAT HAVE RAISE

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:52.677 region:rollup2
REVENUES FOR EXAMPLE EACH OF THE

02:35:50.908 --> 02:35:54.045 region:rollup2
THREE BALLOT MEASURES THAT HAVE

02:35:52.677 --> 02:35:56.013 region:rollup2
GONE TO THE VOTERS ASKING THEM

02:35:54.045 --> 02:35:57.348 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE TOBACCO TAX REVENUES

02:35:56.013 --> 02:35:58.950 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT.

02:35:57.348 --> 02:36:00.651 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND MOST

02:35:58.950 --> 02:36:03.087 region:rollup2
RECENTLY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

02:36:00.651 --> 02:36:05.423 region:rollup2
HAVE RAISED A STATES EXCISE TAX

02:36:03.087 --> 02:36:07.124 region:rollup2
ON TOBACCO DEPOSITED THE

02:36:05.423 --> 02:36:08.292 region:rollup2
REVENUES INTO A SPECIAL FUND.

02:36:07.124 --> 02:36:10.094 region:rollup2
DIDN'T GO TO THE GENERAL FUND

02:36:08.292 --> 02:36:11.229 region:rollup2
BUT IN EACH CASE THEY FELT THAT

02:36:10.094 --> 02:36:12.897 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO ADD

02:36:11.229 --> 02:36:14.732 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE TO THEIR MEASURE THAT

02:36:12.897 --> 02:36:18.903 region:rollup2
SAID BY THE WAY. A THESE ARE

02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:20.371 region:rollup2
REALLY SPECIAL FUND REVENUES

02:36:18.903 --> 02:36:21.872 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT ENTER DEPLETES DON

02:36:20.371 --> 02:36:23.808 region:rollup2
INTERPRET THEM AS GENERAL FUND

02:36:21.872 --> 02:36:25.176 region:rollup2
REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE

02:36:23.808 --> 02:36:26.844 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:36:25.176 --> 02:36:29.013 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE THEY FELT IT PRUDENT

02:36:26.844 --> 02:36:30.548 region:rollup2
TO ADD THAT LANGUAGE. EVEN

02:36:29.013 --> 02:36:32.850 region:rollup2
THOUGH THEY WERE RAISING AN

02:36:30.548 --> 02:36:35.253 region:rollup2
EXCISE TAX AND DEPOSITING THE

02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:36.554 region:rollup2
REVENUES INTO A BRAND NEW

02:36:35.253 --> 02:36:37.288 region:rollup2
SPECIAL FUNDS.

02:36:36.554 --> 02:36:38.189 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO SKIP A FEW TECH

02:36:37.288 --> 02:36:39.957 region:rollup2
SLIDES HERE AND GO.

02:36:38.189 --> 02:36:40.358 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO THIS ONE I'M.

02:36:39.957 --> 02:36:41.892 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE VARYING

02:36:40.358 --> 02:36:44.362 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATIONS HERE I'M IT

02:36:41.892 --> 02:36:46.230 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO US THAT THE STATE COULD

02:36:44.362 --> 02:36:48.1000 region:rollup2
BE VULNERABLE TO LEGAL

02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:50.701 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES I'M IF IT DECIDED TO

02:36:48.1000 --> 02:36:52.136 region:rollup2
IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED TO

02:36:50.701 --> 02:36:54.405 region:rollup2
RAISE TAXES.

02:36:52.136 --> 02:36:56.540 region:rollup2
DEPOSIT THOSE DOLLARS INTO A

02:36:54.405 --> 02:36:58.476 region:rollup2
SPECIAL FUND AND EXCLUDE THEM

02:36:56.540 --> 02:37:00.878 region:rollup2
FROM THE PROPOSITION NINETY

02:36:58.476 --> 02:37:03.314 region:rollup2
EIGHT CALCULATIONS NOW LAWMAKERS

02:37:00.878 --> 02:37:04.916 region:rollup2
ARE COULD ATTEMPT TO DISSUADE

02:37:03.314 --> 02:37:07.518 region:rollup2
LIT AGAINST BY ADDING WHAT ARE

02:37:04.916 --> 02:37:08.819 region:rollup2
CALLED POISON PILLS TO A BILL.

02:37:07.518 --> 02:37:10.187 region:rollup2
I'M A POISON PILL WOULD

02:37:08.819 --> 02:37:11.656 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY BLOW UP THE

02:37:10.187 --> 02:37:13.457 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE WOULD SAY IF ANYONE

02:37:11.656 --> 02:37:15.226 region:rollup2
SUES ON THE BASIS OF PROPOSITION

02:37:13.457 --> 02:37:17.461 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT AND THE STATE LOSES

02:37:15.226 --> 02:37:19.230 region:rollup2
THAT LAWSUIT. THESE REVENUES

02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:20.765 region:rollup2
WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO AWAY ON

02:37:19.230 --> 02:37:22.533 region:rollup2
THE LA AL POINTED OUT IN A

02:37:20.765 --> 02:37:24.001 region:rollup2
REPORT RELEASED LAST YEAR.

02:37:22.533 --> 02:37:25.503 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WERE FOR POISON

02:37:24.001 --> 02:37:26.704 region:rollup2
PILLS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:37:25.503 --> 02:37:28.205 region:rollup2
ADOPTED IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AND

02:37:26.704 --> 02:37:30.174 region:rollup2
EARLY NINETIES WHEN PROP NINETY

02:37:28.205 --> 02:37:31.709 region:rollup2
EIGHT WAS RELATIVELY NEW. AND NO

02:37:30.174 --> 02:37:32.777 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES EVER CAME FORTH

02:37:31.709 --> 02:37:34.378 region:rollup2
FROM THEM AND OTHER WORDS THAT

02:37:32.777 --> 02:37:36.280 region:rollup2
WERE NEVER LAWSUITS THAT SORT OF

02:37:34.378 --> 02:37:38.149 region:rollup2
TESTED ON WHETHER SOMEONE WOULD

02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:39.884 region:rollup2
TAKE IT ALL THE WAY SUE THE

02:37:38.149 --> 02:37:42.186 region:rollup2
STATE AND ARGUE THAT THE REVENUE

02:37:39.884 --> 02:37:43.587 region:rollup2
SHOULD INDEED BE COUNTED TOWARD

02:37:42.186 --> 02:37:45.656 region:rollup2
THE NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE.

02:37:43.587 --> 02:37:47.591 region:rollup2
SO A POISON PILL IS ONE WAY TO

02:37:45.656 --> 02:37:49.593 region:rollup2
GO ANOTHER WAY TO GO IS TO

02:37:47.591 --> 02:37:52.163 region:rollup2
SIMPLY SOMEPLACE ON TO THE

02:37:49.593 --> 02:37:54.432 region:rollup2
BALLOT. A MEASURE THAT WOULD ASK

02:37:52.163 --> 02:37:55.766 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS TO RAISE THE

02:37:54.432 --> 02:37:57.268 region:rollup2
REVENUES NEEDED TO ACHIEVE

02:37:55.766 --> 02:37:59.437 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

02:37:57.268 --> 02:38:01.872 region:rollup2
AND IT TO EXCLUDE THOSE REVENUES

02:37:59.437 --> 02:38:03.407 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY FROM THE CALCULATION

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:05.209 region:rollup2
OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:38:03.407 --> 02:38:07.578 region:rollup2
GUARANTEES SO THERE MAY BE A

02:38:05.209 --> 02:38:10.047 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE WAY TO ADDRESS THE

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:11.615 region:rollup2
ISSUE THIS CONSTRAINT POSED BY

02:38:10.047 --> 02:38:12.984 region:rollup2
THESE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS.

02:38:11.615 --> 02:38:14.618 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S ALSO MAYBE A MORE

02:38:12.984 --> 02:38:16.320 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS WAY THAT'S BEEN USED

02:38:14.618 --> 02:38:17.555 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES OVER THE DECADES

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.489 region:rollup2
WHICH IS TO SIMPLY GO TO THE

02:38:17.555 --> 02:38:21.258 region:rollup2
VOTERS.

02:38:18.489 --> 02:38:22.293 region:rollup2
AND PASSED UP WE THE PEOPLE OF

02:38:21.258 --> 02:38:24.595 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO AMEND OUR

02:38:22.293 --> 02:38:27.164 region:rollup2

COVERAGE I'M TO UNAMBIGUOUSLY BE

02:38:30.001 --> 02:38:33.270 region:rollup2
USED FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

02:38:32.269 --> 02:38:34.872 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN ONLY SORT OF HAVING

02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:36.874 region:rollup2
A CLOUD OVER YOUR HEAD.

02:38:34.872 --> 02:38:38.275 region:rollup2
WONDERING O. OF SOMEDAY THIS MAY

EIGHT AND WILL LOSE A

02:38:39.276 --> 02:38:41.512 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE

02:38:40.644 --> 02:38:43.914 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

02:38:41.512 --> 02:38:45.916 region:rollup2

02:38:43.914 --> 02:38:47.651 region:rollup2
TO K. FOURTEEN ARE AS OPPOSED TO

02:38:45.916 --> 02:38:49.020 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

02:38:47.651 --> 02:38:50.554 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA SKIP TO THE NEXT ISSUE

02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:52.490 region:rollup2
NOW WHICH IS PROPOSITION FOR AS

02:38:50.554 --> 02:38:54.425 region:rollup2
I MENTIONED A PASSED ORIGINALLY

02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:55.493 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE.

02:38:54.425 --> 02:38:57.261 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THIS IS A

02:38:55.493 --> 02:38:59.096 region:rollup2
LIMITATION ON STATE AND LOCAL

02:38:57.261 --> 02:39:01.265 region:rollup2
SPENDING AND I WANTED TO LAY OUT

02:38:59.096 --> 02:39:02.566 region:rollup2
FIRST THE KEY ISSUE HERE I'M FOR

02:39:01.265 --> 02:39:04.368 region:rollup2
YOU RELATED TO UNIVERSAL

02:39:02.566 --> 02:39:07.338 region:rollup2
COVERAGE WHICH IS. IF THE

02:39:04.368 --> 02:39:08.973 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE INCREASED TAXES TO

02:39:07.338 --> 02:39:10.674 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

02:39:08.973 --> 02:39:12.943 region:rollup2
WITH THESE TAXES ESSENTIALLY BE

02:39:10.674 --> 02:39:14.645 region:rollup2
SO HIGH THESE NEW REVENUES

02:39:12.943 --> 02:39:17.181 region:rollup2
BUT THEY WOULD CAUSE THE STATE

02:39:14.645 --> 02:39:18.215 region:rollup2
TO EXCEED ITS APPROPRIATIONS

02:39:17.181 --> 02:39:20.151 region:rollup2
LIMIT WHAT IS.

02:39:18.215 --> 02:39:21.652 region:rollup2
OFTEN KNOWN AS THE CAN LIMIT

02:39:20.151 --> 02:39:22.920 region:rollup2
AFTER ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF

02:39:21.652 --> 02:39:24.622 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION FOR IN NINETEEN

02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:26.123 region:rollup2
SEVENTY NINE.

02:39:24.622 --> 02:39:28.092 region:rollup2
SO I'VE GOT HERE.

02:39:26.123 --> 02:39:29.827 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY A RELATIVELY SIMPLE

02:39:28.092 --> 02:39:31.429 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATION I'M SORRY THERE

02:39:29.827 --> 02:39:32.930 region:rollup2
EVEN FOR BOXES ON THEIR MORE

02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:34.498 region:rollup2
TEXT THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED.

02:39:32.930 --> 02:39:36.567 region:rollup2
THIS IS MY EFFORT TO SORT OF DO

02:39:34.498 --> 02:39:38.169 region:rollup2
STILL FOR YOU SO I DON'T HAVE TO

02:39:36.567 --> 02:39:39.503 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THIS WITH TECH SLIDES

02:39:38.169 --> 02:39:40.805 region:rollup2
THAT I'M GONNA SKIP THE NEXT

02:39:39.503 --> 02:39:42.139 region:rollup2
THREE AFTER THIS BUT I JUST

02:39:40.805 --> 02:39:44.041 region:rollup2
WANTED EVERYONE TO SORT OF BE ON

02:39:42.139 --> 02:39:45.876 region:rollup2
THE SAME PAGE OF JUST ABOUT HOW

02:39:44.041 --> 02:39:47.878 region:rollup2
BEGAN LIMIT WORKS. SO THAT THEN

02:39:45.876 --> 02:39:49.413 region:rollup2
YOU CAN USE THAT TO THINK ABOUT

02:39:47.878 --> 02:39:50.781 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS WOULD AFFECT YOUR

02:39:49.413 --> 02:39:52.349 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO MOVE TOWARD UNIVERSAL

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:53.384 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA SO THE

02:39:52.349 --> 02:39:55.619 region:rollup2
FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS AND IT

02:39:53.384 --> 02:39:57.855 region:rollup2
AGAIN LIMIT. IS THE STATE PASSED

02:39:55.619 --> 02:40:00.257 region:rollup2
TO CALCULATE ITS ANNUAL LIMIT

02:39:57.855 --> 02:40:02.426 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THE LIMIT IS BASED

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:03.794 region:rollup2
ON SPENDING BY THE STATE OF

02:40:02.426 --> 02:40:05.362 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CERTAIN TYPES OF

02:40:03.794 --> 02:40:06.764 region:rollup2
SPENDING BACK IN NINETEEN

02:40:05.362 --> 02:40:07.264 region:rollup2
SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY NINE SO

02:40:06.764 --> 02:40:08.399 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE WE'RE SENSUALLY

02:40:07.264 --> 02:40:10.401 region:rollup2
SETTING.

02:40:08.399 --> 02:40:12.369 region:rollup2
OUR LIMIT BASED ON THE DISCO ERA

02:40:10.401 --> 02:40:13.704 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES OF CALIFORNIA

02:40:12.369 --> 02:40:15.739 region:rollup2
DURING JERRY BROWN'S.

02:40:13.704 --> 02:40:17.374 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HIS SECOND TERM AT

02:40:15.739 --> 02:40:19.276 region:rollup2
THAT POINT MAYBE HIS FIRST TERM

02:40:17.374 --> 02:40:21.412 region:rollup2
THE LIMIT IS ADJUSTED EACH YEAR

02:40:19.276 --> 02:40:23.113 region:rollup2
FOR VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS THE

02:40:21.412 --> 02:40:24.882 region:rollup2
POPPY THAT THE POPULATION

02:40:23.113 --> 02:40:26.150 region:rollup2
GROWING CALIFORNIA. DO WE HAVE

02:40:24.882 --> 02:40:27.518 region:rollup2
MORE KIDS THAT ARE K. TWELVE

02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:29.553 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SYSTEM.

02:40:27.518 --> 02:40:31.455 region:rollup2
DID OUR PER CAPITA PERSONAL

02:40:29.553 --> 02:40:33.224 region:rollup2
INCOME GO UP ALL OF THOSE THINGS

02:40:31.455 --> 02:40:34.525 region:rollup2
GET FACTORED INTO CALCULATING

02:40:33.224 --> 02:40:35.960 region:rollup2
AND NEW LIMITS SO ESSENTIALLY

02:40:34.525 --> 02:40:37.495 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR YOU TAKE THE BASE

02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:39.063 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU ARE. YOU APPLY THE

02:40:37.495 --> 02:40:41.432 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENT FACTORS AND YOU GET A

02:40:39.063 --> 02:40:43.334 region:rollup2
NEW BASE THAT IS YOUR NEW BEGAN

02:40:41.432 --> 02:40:44.702 region:rollup2
LIMIT EACH YEAR AND ALL LOCAL

02:40:43.334 --> 02:40:45.936 region:rollup2
GUY I BELIEVE ALMOST ALL LOCAL

02:40:44.702 --> 02:40:48.272 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE

02:40:45.936 --> 02:40:49.340 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THE SAME

02:40:48.272 --> 02:40:50.407 region:rollup2
EXERCISE EACH YEAR.

02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:52.943 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING THE STATE HAS

02:40:50.407 --> 02:40:55.446 region:rollup2
TO DO IS TO DETERMINE THE

02:40:52.943 --> 02:40:56.447 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT

02:40:55.446 --> 02:40:58.249 region:rollup2
TO THE LIMIT THAT WAS JUST

02:40:56.447 --> 02:40:59.617 region:rollup2
CALCULATED

02:40:58.249 --> 02:41:01.619 region:rollup2
SO A COUPLE IMPORTANT THINGS TO

02:40:59.617 --> 02:41:03.721 region:rollup2
KEEP IN MIND HERE. WE'RE TALKING

02:41:01.619 --> 02:41:06.390 region:rollup2
ABOUT APPROPRIATIONS FROM WHAT

02:41:03.721 --> 02:41:08.359 region:rollup2
ARE CALLED PROCEEDS OF TAXES TAX

02:41:06.390 --> 02:41:10.160 region:rollup2
PROCEEDS WHETHER TAX PROCEEDS

02:41:08.359 --> 02:41:12.129 region:rollup2
THERE THEY ARE THERE ARE VARIOUS

02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:13.464 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT FACTOR INTO PROCEEDS

02:41:12.129 --> 02:41:15.533 region:rollup2
OF TAXES I'M JUST GONNA TELL YOU

02:41:13.464 --> 02:41:16.767 region:rollup2
THE MAIN ONE. WHICH IS REVENUES

02:41:15.533 --> 02:41:18.602 region:rollup2
FROM.

02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:20.237 region:rollup2
STATES GENERAL TAXES THE

02:41:18.602 --> 02:41:21.639 region:rollup2
PERSONAL INCOME TAX

02:41:20.237 --> 02:41:24.041 region:rollup2
SALES AND USE TAX THE

02:41:21.639 --> 02:41:26.510 region:rollup2
CORPORATION TAX ALL THOSE BABIES

02:41:24.041 --> 02:41:29.580 region:rollup2
FOR THE MOST PART THAT IS WHAT.

02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:32.783 region:rollup2
ON THE PROCEEDS OF TAXES.

02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:32.783 region:rollup2
ARE MADE UP BY THERE ARE OTHER

02:41:32.850 --> 02:41:35.753 region:rollup2
REVENUES THEY GET FACTORED IN

02:41:34.351 --> 02:41:38.155 region:rollup2
OKAY SO YOU HAVE PROCEEDS OF

02:41:35.753 --> 02:41:39.890 region:rollup2
TAXES YOU NEXT STEP WITHIN THE

02:41:38.155 --> 02:41:43.127 region:rollup2
SECOND BOX ON THE BOTTOM IS TO

02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:45.195 region:rollup2
DECIDE. WHICH APPROPRIATIONS

02:41:43.127 --> 02:41:46.864 region:rollup2
FROM PROCEEDS OF TAXES ARE

02:41:45.195 --> 02:41:49.133 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO THIS LIMIT BECAUSE

02:41:46.864 --> 02:41:51.068 region:rollup2
NOT ALL APPROPRIATIONS ARE.

02:41:49.133 --> 02:41:52.603 region:rollup2
BASED ON PROP FOR AN PROP ONE

02:41:51.068 --> 02:41:54.204 region:rollup2
ELEVEN THE STATE GETS TO TAKE A

02:41:52.603 --> 02:41:56.106 region:rollup2
LOT OF APPROPRIATIONS OFF THE

02:41:54.204 --> 02:41:57.474 region:rollup2
TOP YOU DON'T COUNT REVENUES

02:41:56.106 --> 02:41:58.609 region:rollup2
THAT YOU TRANSFER TO LOCAL

02:41:57.474 --> 02:42:00.377 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS IN THE FORM OF

02:41:58.609 --> 02:42:01.879 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THAT COUNTS

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:03.147 region:rollup2
TOWARD THEIR OWN GANG LIMITS.

02:42:01.879 --> 02:42:04.381 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING WE'RE

02:42:03.147 --> 02:42:05.783 region:rollup2
DOING IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE

02:42:04.381 --> 02:42:07.618 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID WE HAD

02:42:05.783 --> 02:42:10.688 region:rollup2
TO OUR COURT SAID WE HAD TO.

02:42:07.618 --> 02:42:12.222 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE DEBT SERVICE.

02:42:10.688 --> 02:42:13.190 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MAJOR

02:42:12.222 --> 02:42:14.658 region:rollup2
ONES THERE ARE OTHER ONES THAT

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:16.827 region:rollup2
I'M I I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO

02:42:14.658 --> 02:42:18.395 region:rollup2
BUT THE IDEA IS BEGAN LIMIT

02:42:16.827 --> 02:42:20.831 region:rollup2
APPLIES TO CERTAIN

02:42:18.395 --> 02:42:22.833 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS. FROM TAX

02:42:20.831 --> 02:42:24.802 region:rollup2
PROCEEDS EACH YEAR SO THEN WHAT

02:42:22.833 --> 02:42:26.570 region:rollup2
DO YOU DO YOU GO TO STEP THREE

02:42:24.802 --> 02:42:28.405 region:rollup2
BACK UP TO THE TOP NOW ON THE

02:42:26.570 --> 02:42:30.708 region:rollup2
RIGHT. AND ESSENTIALLY YOU

02:42:28.405 --> 02:42:31.976 region:rollup2
COMPARE YOUR LIMIT. TO THE EX TO

02:42:30.708 --> 02:42:33.711 region:rollup2
THE EXPENDITURES OR THE

02:42:31.976 --> 02:42:35.179 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT

02:42:33.711 --> 02:42:37.081 region:rollup2
TO THE LIMIT AND WHAT IS THE

02:42:35.179 --> 02:42:40.818 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION SAY HERE. IT SAYS

02:42:37.081 --> 02:42:40.818 region:rollup2
THAT IF.

02:42:40.884 --> 02:42:45.456 region:rollup2
YOUR EXPENDITURES ARE YOUR

02:42:42.553 --> 02:42:47.591 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS REACH YOUR LIMIT.

02:42:45.456 --> 02:42:49.560 region:rollup2
ANY REVENUES REMAINING OVER THAT

02:42:47.591 --> 02:42:51.662 region:rollup2
TWO YEAR PERIOD ARE CONSIDERED

02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:53.430 region:rollup2
EXCESS REVENUES

02:42:51.662 --> 02:42:54.632 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTION SAYS WHAT DO

02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:56.700 region:rollup2
YOU DO WITH EXCESS REVENUES

02:42:54.632 --> 02:42:57.935 region:rollup2
COMING DOWN A STEP FOR.

02:42:56.700 --> 02:42:59.036 region:rollup2
HALF OF THEM GO TO PROP NINETY

02:42:57.935 --> 02:43:00.638 region:rollup2
EIGHT IN THE FORM OF ADDITIONAL

02:42:59.036 --> 02:43:02.373 region:rollup2
SPENDING AND HALF OF THEM GO

02:43:00.638 --> 02:43:05.009 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE VOTERS TO TAX PAYER

02:43:02.373 --> 02:43:06.477 region:rollup2
OR TO TO TAXPAYERS AS REBATES.

02:43:05.009 --> 02:43:07.711 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAD THE OPTION

02:43:06.477 --> 02:43:09.480 region:rollup2
OF TAKING SOME OF THESE REVENUES

02:43:07.711 --> 02:43:10.748 region:rollup2
AND SAY WELL WAIT A MINUTE MAYBE

02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:11.982 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT EXACTLY

02:43:10.748 --> 02:43:14.485 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA SPEND SOME OF THEM

02:43:11.982 --> 02:43:16.954 region:rollup2
FOR NON. A REP FOR.

02:43:14.485 --> 02:43:18.489 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE EXEMPT

02:43:16.954 --> 02:43:19.823 region:rollup2
FROM BEGAN LIMIT RIGHT AS I

02:43:18.489 --> 02:43:21.759 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT NOT ALL

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:23.027 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS APPLY RIGHT TO

02:43:21.759 --> 02:43:24.595 region:rollup2
BEGIN LIMIT SO THERE ARE SOME

02:43:23.027 --> 02:43:25.763 region:rollup2
THINGS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SPEND

02:43:24.595 --> 02:43:27.197 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE REVENUES ARE BUT

02:43:25.763 --> 02:43:28.198 region:rollup2
THE HOPE FOR THE MOST PART. THE

02:43:27.197 --> 02:43:30.367 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC ANSWER THE

02:43:28.198 --> 02:43:32.169 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION GIVES IS IF WE

02:43:30.367 --> 02:43:34.538 region:rollup2
SPEND UP TO OUR LIMIT. A COUPLE

02:43:32.169 --> 02:43:37.174 region:rollup2
YEARS IN A ROW.

02:43:34.538 --> 02:43:39.209 region:rollup2
ANY REVENUES BEYOND THAT LIMIT.

02:43:37.174 --> 02:43:41.078 region:rollup2
FROM PROCEEDS TO TAXES GO BACK

02:43:39.209 --> 02:43:41.912 region:rollup2
TO THE TAXPAYERS AND GO TO PROP

02:43:41.078 --> 02:43:43.280 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT IN THE FORM OF

02:43:41.912 --> 02:43:47.851 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SPENDING.

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:51.188 region:rollup2
SO WHY DID I TELL YOU ALL THAT.

02:43:47.851 --> 02:43:53.691 region:rollup2
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

02:43:51.188 --> 02:43:55.559 region:rollup2
RAISING REVENUES TO PAY FOR

02:43:53.691 --> 02:43:57.394 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE OUR EXPANDED

02:43:55.559 --> 02:43:58.429 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:43:57.394 --> 02:44:00.464 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CONSIDERED PROCEEDS OF

02:43:58.429 --> 02:44:02.032 region:rollup2
TAXES.

02:44:00.464 --> 02:44:03.801 region:rollup2
AND WOULD GO TO SERVICE SAYS

02:44:05.536 --> 02:44:10.407 region:rollup2
EXCLUDED FROM AGAIN LIMIT.

02:44:08.372 --> 02:44:11.942 region:rollup2
THESE ARE ALL EXPENDITURES OR

02:44:10.407 --> 02:44:14.044 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS THAT WOULD BE

02:44:11.942 --> 02:44:16.246 region:rollup2
COUNTED FOR THE GANG LIMIT NOW

02:44:14.044 --> 02:44:17.781 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ACCORDING TO

02:44:16.246 --> 02:44:19.583 region:rollup2

ROOM. UNDERNEATH THE LIMITIN

02:44:23.354 --> 02:44:26.256 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS WE'RE NOT AT THE

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:28.392 region:rollup2
LIMIT WERE BELOW THE LIMIT FOR

02:44:26.256 --> 02:44:29.693 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT MATTER.

02:44:28.392 --> 02:44:31.428 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS

02:44:29.693 --> 02:44:33.197 region:rollup2
IN ROOM WHAT IF WE DECIDED TO DO

02:44:31.428 --> 02:44:35.365 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:44:33.197 --> 02:44:36.533 region:rollup2
WE SOMEHOW GOT A TWO HUNDRED UP

02:44:35.365 --> 02:44:37.668 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR

02:44:36.533 --> 02:44:39.837 region:rollup2
TAX INCREASE THROUGH THE

02:44:37.668 --> 02:44:41.004 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE.

02:44:39.837 --> 02:44:42.239 region:rollup2
AND APPROPRIATE A TWO HUNDRED

02:44:41.004 --> 02:44:43.741 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS TOWARD A SINGLE

02:44:42.239 --> 02:44:45.075 region:rollup2
PAYER SYSTEM

02:44:43.741 --> 02:44:47.578 region:rollup2
I'M WHAT YOU CAN SEE HAPPENING

02:44:45.075 --> 02:44:48.946 region:rollup2
IS YOU WOULD BY DEFINITION BE

02:44:47.578 --> 02:44:50.314 region:rollup2
EXCEEDING AGAIN LIMIT BECAUSE

02:44:48.946 --> 02:44:52.116 region:rollup2
YOU ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWELVE

02:44:50.314 --> 02:44:54.118 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN ROOM. SO

02:44:52.116 --> 02:44:56.086 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT GOES BEYOND ANY

02:44:54.118 --> 02:44:57.821 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS FROM PROCEEDS OF

02:44:56.086 --> 02:44:59.757 region:rollup2
TAXES THAT GO BEYOND TWELVE

02:44:57.821 --> 02:45:00.657 region:rollup2
BILLION AT THIS POINT AND THE

02:44:59.757 --> 02:45:02.926 region:rollup2
NUMBER MAY MOVE AROUND A LITTLE

02:45:00.657 --> 02:45:06.330 region:rollup2
BIT. WOULD BE CONSIDERED ACCESS

02:45:02.926 --> 02:45:08.365 region:rollup2
REVENUES AND WOULD HAVE TO BUY

02:45:06.330 --> 02:45:09.767 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION.

02:45:08.365 --> 02:45:11.268 region:rollup2
GO BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS AND GO

02:45:09.767 --> 02:45:12.803 region:rollup2
TO ADDITIONAL PROPOSITION NINETY

02:45:11.268 --> 02:45:14.405 region:rollup2
EIGHT SPENDING AND COULD NOT BE

02:45:12.803 --> 02:45:16.306 region:rollup2
USED FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH

02:45:14.405 --> 02:45:16.907 region:rollup2
THE REVENUES WERE RAISED. IN

02:45:16.306 --> 02:45:19.209 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

02:45:16.907 --> 02:45:21.145 region:rollup2
SO.

02:45:19.209 --> 02:45:22.513 region:rollup2
KEN THE LEGISLATURE IF IT WANTED

02:45:21.145 --> 02:45:24.515 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

02:45:22.513 --> 02:45:25.549 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A SIMILAR ANSWER TO

02:45:24.515 --> 02:45:27.284 region:rollup2
WHAT I GAVE BEFORE I'M PROP

02:45:25.549 --> 02:45:30.087 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT CALIFORNIA VOTERS

02:45:27.284 --> 02:45:31.789 region:rollup2
ARE USED TO SEEING. A REQUEST TO

02:45:30.087 --> 02:45:33.157 region:rollup2
AMEND OUR STATE CONSTITUTION IT

02:45:31.789 --> 02:45:35.025 region:rollup2
HAPPENS EVERY TWO YEARS IT'S

02:45:33.157 --> 02:45:36.794 region:rollup2
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN THIS YEAR THE

02:45:35.025 --> 02:45:38.595 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE COULD ADVANCE A

02:45:36.794 --> 02:45:40.330 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. UP

02:45:38.595 --> 02:45:42.032 region:rollup2
THAT NOT ONLY PASSED VOTERS TO

02:45:40.330 --> 02:45:44.034 region:rollup2
RAISE THE TAXES NECESSARY TO

02:45:42.032 --> 02:45:45.369 region:rollup2
FUND THE SYSTEM THAT EXCLUDES

02:45:44.034 --> 02:45:47.004 region:rollup2
THE REVENUES SPECIFICALLY FROM

02:45:45.369 --> 02:45:48.772 region:rollup2
THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE

02:45:47.004 --> 02:45:51.442 region:rollup2
IF IT WANTED TO DO SO BUT COULD

02:45:48.772 --> 02:45:52.876 region:rollup2
ALSO ASK VOTERS TO REVISED AGAIN

02:45:51.442 --> 02:45:54.945 region:rollup2
LIMIT IN SUCH A WAY.

02:45:52.876 --> 02:45:56.246 region:rollup2
THAT THESE NEW EXPENDITURES

02:45:54.945 --> 02:45:58.415 region:rollup2
THESE NEW APPROPRIATIONS WOULD

02:45:56.246 --> 02:46:00.417 region:rollup2
NOT BELOW PASSED AGAIN LIMIT.

02:45:58.415 --> 02:46:02.486 region:rollup2
AND BE COUNTED SORT OF AS

02:46:00.417 --> 02:46:04.154 region:rollup2
EXCESS REVENUES NOT BEING ABLE

02:46:02.486 --> 02:46:06.323 region:rollup2
TO BE USED ESSENTIALLY FOR

02:46:04.154 --> 02:46:08.926 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

02:46:06.323 --> 02:46:10.461 region:rollup2
SO HOPEFULLY THAT WAS I I TRIED

02:46:08.926 --> 02:46:11.995 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT AS CLEAR AS I COULD

02:46:10.461 --> 02:46:13.564 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS

02:46:11.995 --> 02:46:14.898 region:rollup2
CLEAR ENOUGH I'M I'M HAPPY TO

02:46:13.564 --> 02:46:15.999 region:rollup2
TAKE QUESTIONS FIRST I WANTED TO

02:46:14.898 --> 02:46:17.534 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU JUST A FEW CAN

02:46:15.999 --> 02:46:19.236 region:rollup2
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS.

02:46:17.534 --> 02:46:20.637 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT THAT THE FIRST KEY

02:46:19.236 --> 02:46:22.272 region:rollup2
POINT TO KEEP THAT THE KEEP IN

02:46:20.637 --> 02:46:24.942 region:rollup2
MIND HERE IS THAT.

02:46:22.272 --> 02:46:26.343 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO ITS AT THE PRICE AS

02:46:24.942 --> 02:46:27.478 region:rollup2
A PROP NINETY EIGHT AND AGAIN

02:46:26.343 --> 02:46:28.979 region:rollup2
LIMIT BOTH CONSTRAIN THE

02:46:27.478 --> 02:46:31.815 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY.

02:46:28.979 --> 02:46:33.984 region:rollup2
TO SORT OF ENACT MAJOR NEW.

02:46:31.815 --> 02:46:35.586 region:rollup2
PROGRAM EXPENDITURES THIS ISN'T

02:46:33.984 --> 02:46:37.254 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT APPLIES JUST TO

02:46:35.586 --> 02:46:38.355 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WERE TALKING

02:46:37.254 --> 02:46:40.023 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF

02:46:38.355 --> 02:46:40.991 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE HERE BUT IF

02:46:40.023 --> 02:46:42.993 region:rollup2
THE STATE WANTED TO MAKE

02:46:40.991 --> 02:46:44.561 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN HIGHER

02:46:42.993 --> 02:46:47.197 region:rollup2
EDUCATION THE YOU SEE IN THE CS

02:46:44.561 --> 02:46:48.932 region:rollup2
YOU. ARE IN AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE

02:46:47.197 --> 02:46:50.501 region:rollup2
ON IN A RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND

02:46:48.932 --> 02:46:52.169 region:rollup2
SERVICES IT WOULD STILL BE

02:46:50.501 --> 02:46:53.403 region:rollup2
DEALING. WITH THESE TYPES OF

02:46:52.169 --> 02:46:54.571 region:rollup2
ISSUES I'M BRINGING THEM UP

02:46:53.403 --> 02:46:56.340 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE'RE

02:46:54.571 --> 02:46:57.641 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT

02:46:56.340 --> 02:46:59.276 region:rollup2
OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

02:46:57.641 --> 02:47:00.811 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT SOME

02:46:59.276 --> 02:47:02.112 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES SPECIFICALLY SOME MAP

02:47:00.811 --> 02:47:04.114 region:rollup2
I'M PROPONENTS OF SENATE BILL

02:47:02.112 --> 02:47:05.249 region:rollup2
FIVE SIXTY TWO. HAVE ASSERTED

02:47:04.114 --> 02:47:07.217 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:47:05.249 --> 02:47:09.887 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THESE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:47:07.217 --> 02:47:11.421 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINTS LEGISLATIVELY I'M

02:47:09.887 --> 02:47:12.923 region:rollup2
WITHOUT GOING TO THE VOTERS

02:47:11.421 --> 02:47:15.058 region:rollup2
WITHOUT CONSULTING THE VOTERS

02:47:12.923 --> 02:47:16.860 region:rollup2
AND BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF YOU

02:47:15.058 --> 02:47:18.061 region:rollup2
KNOW GOOD WORK THE LA HOW HAS

02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:19.329 region:rollup2
DONE OF OUR READ OF THE STATE

02:47:18.061 --> 02:47:21.732 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION.

02:47:19.329 --> 02:47:23.066 region:rollup2
OUR RESPONSE TO THAT IS

02:47:21.732 --> 02:47:24.601 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY IT SEEMS VERY

02:47:23.066 --> 02:47:26.870 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:47:24.601 --> 02:47:27.538 region:rollup2
COULD ADDRESS THE PROBLEM POSED

02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:29.940 region:rollup2
BY THE CAMERAMAN.

02:47:27.538 --> 02:47:31.041 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVELY WITHOUT GOING TO

02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:33.010 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS.

02:47:31.041 --> 02:47:34.711 region:rollup2
AND THAT GOING AROUND PROP

02:47:33.010 --> 02:47:36.847 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT COULD TRIGGER A

02:47:34.711 --> 02:47:38.682 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT JUST BASED ON THESE

02:47:36.847 --> 02:47:40.450 region:rollup2
VARYING INTERPRETATIONS PALM

02:47:38.682 --> 02:47:42.052 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD PUT. UNIVERSAL

02:47:40.450 --> 02:47:43.520 region:rollup2
COVERAGE ANY NEW PROGRAMS AND

02:47:42.052 --> 02:47:46.490 region:rollup2
SERVICES PUT ON CLICK PUT IN

02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:48.592 region:rollup2
PLACE ON A VERY SHAKY LEGAL

02:47:46.490 --> 02:47:49.893 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION WHICH IS PROBABLY NOT

02:47:48.592 --> 02:47:52.195 region:rollup2
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT

02:47:49.893 --> 02:47:55.098 region:rollup2
TO BE WHEN IT'S ATTEMPTING UP TO

02:47:52.195 --> 02:47:56.600 region:rollup2
PROVIDE. A RANGE OF ROBUST OF

02:47:55.098 --> 02:47:58.936 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN THE HEALTH CARE AND

02:47:56.600 --> 02:48:01.905 region:rollup2
ARENA TO CALIFORNIA AND SO.

02:47:58.936 --> 02:48:03.674 region:rollup2
JUST THE BOTTOM LINE HERE.

02:48:01.905 --> 02:48:05.509 region:rollup2
IF IT ASKING CALIFORNIA VOTERS

02:48:03.674 --> 02:48:07.444 region:rollup2
TO REMOVE THESE CONSTRAINTS

02:48:05.509 --> 02:48:08.078 region:rollup2
WOULD PROBABLY BE A BETTER WAY

02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:12.115 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND I'LL CONCLUDE THEIR

02:48:08.078 --> 02:48:14.251 region:rollup2

THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

02:49:43.674 --> 02:49:48.478 region:rollup2
I MEAN ACTUALLY FLIP AHEAD TO

THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO HERE.

02:49:48.478 --> 02:49:52.082 region:rollup2
TO BREAK BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHERE

02:49:51.314 --> 02:49:53.517 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS OBTAIN THEIR

02:49:53.517 --> 02:49:56.086 region:rollup2
SO JUMPING DOWN ACTUALLY TO THE

02:49:55.552 --> 02:49:57.988 region:rollup2
BOTTOM.

02:49:56.086 --> 02:49:59.556 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT THE LARGEST

02:49:57.988 --> 02:50:01.324 region:rollup2
PORTION OF CALIFORNIANS PROBABLY

02:49:59.556 --> 02:50:03.460 region:rollup2
A LITTLE OVER FIFTEEN MILLION.

02:50:01.324 --> 02:50:04.728 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS OBTAIN COVERAGE

02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:05.595 region:rollup2
THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYERS OR

02:50:04.728 --> 02:50:07.197 region:rollup2
THROUGH EMPLOYER SPONSORED

02:50:07.197 --> 02:50:10.333 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AN ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN

02:50:09.199 --> 02:50:11.835 region:rollup2
TO FOURTEEN MILLION OBTAIN

02:50:10.333 --> 02:50:13.570 region:rollup2
COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID OUT

02:50:11.835 --> 02:50:15.205 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S MEDICAID PROGRAM FOR

02:50:13.570 --> 02:50:16.807 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND THEN

02:50:15.205 --> 02:50:18.642 region:rollup2
FOUR TO FIVE MILLION OBTAIN

02:50:16.807 --> 02:50:19.843 region:rollup2
COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICARE WHICH

02:50:18.642 --> 02:50:21.144 region:rollup2
IS FOR THE ELDERLY AND.

02:50:19.843 --> 02:50:23.313 region:rollup2
AND CERTAIN DISABLED

02:50:21.144 --> 02:50:24.915 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

02:50:23.313 --> 02:50:26.650 region:rollup2
FINALLY THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET.

02:50:24.915 --> 02:50:29.252 region:rollup2
PROVIDES COVERAGE TO TWO TO

02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:31.655 region:rollup2
THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND

02:50:29.252 --> 02:50:33.590 region:rollup2
THEN WE LEFT AFTER SOME SMALLER

02:50:31.655 --> 02:50:36.026 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PROGRAMS WITH A

02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:37.761 region:rollup2
RESIDUAL UNINSURED POPULATION OF

02:50:36.026 --> 02:50:40.163 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHICH

02:50:37.761 --> 02:50:44.434 region:rollup2
I WILL. GO INTO NEXT

02:50:40.163 --> 02:50:46.203 region:rollup2
TO DESCRIBE A LITTLE FURTHER.

02:50:44.434 --> 02:50:48.472 region:rollup2
SO THERE ABOUT THREE MILLION

02:50:46.203 --> 02:50:51.007 region:rollup2
REMAINING UNINSURED AND WE WOULD

02:50:48.472 --> 02:50:52.776 region:rollup2
DIVIDE THESE INDIVIDUALS AND TO.

02:50:51.007 --> 02:50:54.978 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TWO CATEGORIES THE

02:50:52.776 --> 02:50:56.213 region:rollup2
FIRST WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR LESS

02:50:54.978 --> 02:50:58.215 region:rollup2
THAN TO MILLION OF THEIR

02:50:56.213 --> 02:50:59.549 region:rollup2
REMAINING AND THEN SHARED ARE

02:50:58.215 --> 02:51:01.251 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED ENCOURAGE

02:50:59.549 --> 02:51:03.553 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANTS THE MAJORITY OF WHOM

02:51:01.251 --> 02:51:04.221 region:rollup2
ARE LOW INCOME. LOW INCOME SO

02:51:03.553 --> 02:51:06.790 region:rollup2

02:55:38.395 --> 02:55:42.165 region:rollup2
FINANCED HEALTH CARE PROGRAM.

02:55:40.230 --> 02:55:44.734 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE L. ILIO

02:55:42.165 --> 02:55:46.302 region:rollup2
ANALYZE THE COST OF A STATEWIDE

02:55:44.734 --> 02:55:47.871 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY FINANCE HEALTHCARE

02:55:46.302 --> 02:55:49.539 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT WOULD REPLACE THE

02:55:47.871 --> 02:55:51.074 region:rollup2
EXISTING MULTI PAYER HEALTHCARE

02:55:49.539 --> 02:55:52.041 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:55:51.074 --> 02:55:53.977 region:rollup2
THEY WERE GENERALLY PROVIDE

02:55:52.041 --> 02:55:55.478 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVE FINANCING OF

02:55:53.977 --> 02:55:57.113 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SERVICES ACROSS THE

02:55:55.478 --> 02:55:58.915 region:rollup2
STATE AND WOULD NOT DIRECTLY

02:55:57.113 --> 02:56:00.150 region:rollup2
OPERATE HOSPITALS WERE EMPLOYED

02:55:58.915 --> 02:56:02.152 region:rollup2
THE WORK FIRST BUT INSTEAD

02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:03.553 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY BE FOCUSED WITHOUT

02:56:02.152 --> 02:56:05.221 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON FINANCING THE

02:56:03.553 --> 02:56:06.823 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT ARE

02:56:05.221 --> 02:56:08.758 region:rollup2
CURRENT.

02:56:06.823 --> 02:56:10.293 region:rollup2
WE JUST NOTE SO WE'LL GO

02:56:08.758 --> 02:56:12.061 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR ESTIMATES BUT A

02:56:10.293 --> 02:56:13.329 region:rollup2
PROGRAM STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY

02:56:12.061 --> 02:56:15.565 region:rollup2
THE ONE THAN THE ONE THAT WE

02:56:13.329 --> 02:56:16.933 region:rollup2
ANALYZE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:56:15.565 --> 02:56:18.635 region:rollup2
COULD COST TENS OF BILLIONS OF

02:56:16.933 --> 02:56:20.804 region:rollup2
DOLLARS MORE OR TENS OF BILLIONS

02:56:18.635 --> 02:56:22.439 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS LESS THAN. THE ONE

02:56:20.804 --> 02:56:24.841 region:rollup2
THAT WE ANALYZED

02:56:22.439 --> 02:56:25.408 region:rollup2
IN ANALYZING THE DATA PROGRAM WE

02:56:24.841 --> 02:56:27.677 region:rollup2
MADE UP.

02:56:25.408 --> 02:56:29.679 region:rollup2
SAID OF MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS

02:56:27.677 --> 02:56:31.614 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THAT IT WOULD COVER

02:56:29.679 --> 02:56:33.183 region:rollup2
NEARLY ALL CALIFORNIANS BY

02:56:31.614 --> 02:56:34.484 region:rollup2
INCORPORATING THE EXISTING

02:56:33.183 --> 02:56:36.653 region:rollup2
FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING

02:56:34.484 --> 02:56:38.688 region:rollup2
STREAMS REDIRECTING THOSE TO BE

02:56:36.653 --> 02:56:40.290 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PAY FOR. A A SINGLE

02:56:38.688 --> 02:56:42.292 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE PUBLICLY FINANCED

02:56:40.290 --> 02:56:44.227 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SUCH AS MEDICARE AND

02:56:42.292 --> 02:56:45.562 region:rollup2
MEDICAID WHICH PREVIOUS SPEAKERS

02:56:44.227 --> 02:56:46.229 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

02:56:45.562 --> 02:56:48.431 region:rollup2
OF.

02:56:46.229 --> 02:56:50.033 region:rollup2
.

02:56:48.431 --> 02:56:51.801 region:rollup2
AND WE ASSUME THAT THE SYSTEM

02:56:50.033 --> 02:56:54.237 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A FEE FOR SERVICE

02:56:51.801 --> 02:56:56.573 region:rollup2
DELIVERY SYSTEM WHERE INDIVIDUAL

02:56:54.237 --> 02:56:57.874 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT AND GOT US THE

02:56:56.573 --> 02:57:00.043 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT INDIVIDUALS.

02:56:57.874 --> 02:57:02.545 region:rollup2
UTILIZE WOULD BE SEPARATELY

02:57:00.043 --> 02:57:03.847 region:rollup2
PAID FOR ON THEIR OWN AND THAT

02:57:02.545 --> 02:57:04.848 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM WOULD PAY.

02:57:03.847 --> 02:57:08.418 region:rollup2
PROVIDER RATES THAT ARE

02:57:04.848 --> 02:57:09.219 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE TO WHAT MEDICARE PAYS

02:57:08.418 --> 02:57:10.653 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE LITTLE ALONE WHAT WE

02:57:09.219 --> 02:57:12.155 region:rollup2
THINK HIGHER THAN WHAT MEDI CAL

02:57:10.653 --> 02:57:14.491 region:rollup2
PAYS IN FEE FOR SERVICE.

02:57:12.155 --> 02:57:15.925 region:rollup2
BUT NOT NECESSARILY AS HIGH AS

02:57:14.491 --> 02:57:20.497 region:rollup2
THE COMMERCIAL RATES THAT.

02:57:15.925 --> 02:57:23.032 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURERS TEND TO PAY.

02:57:20.497 --> 02:57:24.400 region:rollup2
WITH THE SYSTEM THAT WE ALSO

02:57:23.032 --> 02:57:26.302 region:rollup2
THAT WE ANALYZED OUGHT WOULD

02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:28.004 region:rollup2
OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF

02:57:26.302 --> 02:57:29.706 region:rollup2
BENEFITS INCLUDING CERTAIN

02:57:28.004 --> 02:57:30.640 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT ARE NOT OFFERED

02:57:29.706 --> 02:57:32.575 region:rollup2
THROUGH TRADITIONAL HEALTH

02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:33.776 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PROJECT PRODUCTS IN

02:57:32.575 --> 02:57:36.012 region:rollup2
THROUGH EMPLOYER SPONSORED

02:57:33.776 --> 02:57:38.314 region:rollup2
INSURANCE FOR EXAMPLE. SUCH AS

02:57:36.012 --> 02:57:40.116 region:rollup2
LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS DENTAL

02:57:38.314 --> 02:57:41.518 region:rollup2
INVENTED VISION BENEFITS.

02:57:40.116 --> 02:57:43.219 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY WE ASSUME THAT

02:57:41.518 --> 02:57:44.721 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM WOULD HAVE NO COST

02:57:43.219 --> 02:57:46.489 region:rollup2
SHARING THAT BAD THERE'D BE NO

02:57:44.721 --> 02:57:48.424 region:rollup2
CO PAYS OR DEDUCTIBLES FOR THE

02:57:46.489 --> 02:57:49.526 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE FOR INDIVIDUAL

02:57:48.424 --> 02:57:52.862 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT.

02:57:49.526 --> 02:57:54.731 region:rollup2
THE STATE RESIDENTS UTILIZE.

02:57:52.862 --> 02:57:54.964 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATED THAT THIS COST

02:57:54.731 --> 02:57:56.833 region:rollup2
WOULD.

02:57:54.964 --> 02:57:58.768 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM WOULD COST ABOUT

02:57:56.833 --> 02:58:00.537 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ON

02:57:58.768 --> 02:58:02.272 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:58:00.537 --> 02:58:03.606 region:rollup2
TERMS BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT

02:58:02.272 --> 02:58:05.175 region:rollup2
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY

02:58:03.606 --> 02:58:07.844 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING THAT ESTIMATE.

02:58:05.175 --> 02:58:09.312 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT IT WOULD BE SUCH A A

02:58:07.844 --> 02:58:10.380 region:rollup2
LARGE TRANSFORMATION AND HOW THE

02:58:09.312 --> 02:58:11.748 region:rollup2
STATE DELIVERS HEALTHCARE

02:58:10.380 --> 02:58:13.850 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

02:58:11.748 --> 02:58:15.652 region:rollup2
WE SOON THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES

02:58:13.850 --> 02:58:16.719 region:rollup2
A SUCH AS DOCTORS VISITS

02:58:15.652 --> 02:58:18.755 region:rollup2
SERVICES THE HOSPITAL IN

02:58:16.719 --> 02:58:20.056 region:rollup2
PHARMACEUTICALS.

02:58:18.755 --> 02:58:21.524 region:rollup2
WOULD REALLY COMPRISE THE TO

02:58:20.056 --> 02:58:23.826 region:rollup2
THE BULK OF SPENDING IN THE

02:58:21.524 --> 02:58:25.361 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT ADMINISTRATIVE OUR

02:58:23.826 --> 02:58:26.663 region:rollup2
STATE OPERATIONS SPENDING WHAT

02:58:25.361 --> 02:58:28.031 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN TEN

02:58:26.663 --> 02:58:29.799 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF TOTAL PROGRAM

02:58:28.031 --> 02:58:31.534 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES.

02:58:29.799 --> 02:58:33.536 region:rollup2
WE ALSO ASSUMED THAT THE TWO

02:58:31.534 --> 02:58:34.003 region:rollup2
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL

02:58:33.536 --> 02:58:34.504 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SPENDING COULD

02:58:34.003 --> 02:58:37.941 region:rollup2
BEREDIRECTED TO FUND THE

02:58:34.504 --> 02:58:39.742 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

02:58:37.941 --> 02:58:41.744 region:rollup2
AND JUST NOTE THAT THERE IS

02:58:39.742 --> 02:58:43.346 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY AS WAS PREVIOUSLY

02:58:41.744 --> 02:58:45.014 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED ON WHETHER IN FACT NOT

02:58:43.346 --> 02:58:46.749 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THAT COULD BE THE

02:58:45.014 --> 02:58:48.284 region:rollup2
CASE.

02:58:46.749 --> 02:58:49.586 region:rollup2
THIS LEAVES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

02:58:48.284 --> 02:58:51.054 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

02:58:49.586 --> 02:58:52.188 region:rollup2
STATE REVENUE THAT WOULD BE

02:58:51.054 --> 02:58:53.089 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO FULLY FUND THE PROGRAM

02:58:52.188 --> 02:58:55.458 region:rollup2
HOPE.

02:58:53.089 --> 02:58:57.293 region:rollup2
.

02:58:55.458 --> 02:58:58.628 region:rollup2
I AND THIS REVENUE WOULD LIKELY

02:58:57.293 --> 02:59:01.965 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE REYES THROUGH THE

02:58:58.628 --> 02:59:04.500 region:rollup2
STATE'S TAX SYSTEM.

02:59:01.965 --> 02:59:06.803 region:rollup2
TO CONCLUDE MY PORTION.

02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:09.906 region:rollup2
IF THE LA OWES REMARKS I'M

02:59:06.803 --> 02:59:11.174 region:rollup2
GONNA TURN TO A SET OF PROPOSALS

02:59:09.906 --> 02:59:13.343 region:rollup2
THAT DOUR REALLY POLICY

02:59:11.174 --> 02:59:15.211 region:rollup2
APPROACHES THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED

02:59:13.343 --> 02:59:16.713 region:rollup2
BY THE COMMITTEE DISCUSS. TO

02:59:15.211 --> 02:59:17.747 region:rollup2
EXTEND COVERAGE TO THE REMAINING

02:59:16.713 --> 02:59:19.849 region:rollup2
AND THEN SHARED.

02:59:17.747 --> 02:59:21.951 region:rollup2
THROUGH REALLY THE EXISTING

02:59:19.849 --> 02:59:23.686 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

02:59:21.951 --> 02:59:26.022 region:rollup2
CERTAIN APPROACHES WOULD BE

02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:28.324 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO TARGET THIS FIRST

02:59:26.022 --> 02:59:30.093 region:rollup2
GROUP ARE UNINSURED LOW INCOME

02:59:28.324 --> 02:59:32.095 region:rollup2
DOT AND I UNDOCUMENTED

02:59:30.093 --> 02:59:33.830 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANTS PA WHO WE ESTIMATE

02:59:32.095 --> 02:59:35.632 region:rollup2
ARE ABOVE ABOUT ALMOST TWO

02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:36.866 region:rollup2
THIRDS OF THE REMAINING ON AND

02:59:35.632 --> 02:59:38.735 region:rollup2
SHARE.

02:59:36.866 --> 02:59:40.236 region:rollup2
WE DEFINE AGAIN LOW INCOME AS

02:59:38.735 --> 02:59:41.504 region:rollup2
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

02:59:40.236 --> 02:59:43.039 region:rollup2
EARNING LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED

02:59:41.504 --> 02:59:44.407 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

02:59:43.039 --> 02:59:46.275 region:rollup2
LINE THE CUT OFF FOR FEDERAL

02:59:44.407 --> 02:59:47.710 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES TO

02:59:46.275 --> 02:59:50.113 region:rollup2
COVERED CALIFORNIA.

02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:52.282 region:rollup2
FIRST POLICY APPROACH WOULD BE

02:59:50.113 --> 02:59:54.117 region:rollup2
OUT TO EXTEND FULL SCOPE MEDICAL

02:59:52.282 --> 02:59:56.119 region:rollup2
COVERAGE FOR INCOME ELIGIBLE

02:59:54.117 --> 02:59:57.854 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT ADULTS

02:59:56.119 --> 02:59:59.722 region:rollup2
THAT IS IMMIGRANT ADULTS EARNING

02:59:57.854 --> 03:00:01.924 region:rollup2
LESS THAN MY ONE HUNDRED AND

02:59:59.722 --> 03:00:03.660 region:rollup2
THIRTY PER A PERCENT GENERALLY

03:00:01.924 --> 03:00:05.495 region:rollup2
OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

03:00:03.660 --> 03:00:07.397 region:rollup2
AND THIS TRANSLATES INTO ABOUT

03:00:05.495 --> 03:00:09.232 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

03:00:07.397 --> 03:00:11.100 region:rollup2
A FAMILY OF FOUR.

03:00:09.232 --> 03:00:12.502 region:rollup2
MORE AND PREVIOUSLY A COUPLE OF

03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:14.604 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THE STATE ACTUALLY

03:00:12.502 --> 03:00:16.239 region:rollup2
EXTENDED A FULL SCOPE MEDICAL

03:00:14.604 --> 03:00:18.107 region:rollup2
COVERAGE TO CHILDREN

03:00:16.239 --> 03:00:20.443 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT CHILDREN

03:00:18.107 --> 03:00:22.612 region:rollup2
UP TO AGE NINETEEN.

03:00:20.443 --> 03:00:24.914 region:rollup2
BUT ADULTS REMAIN ONLY ELIGIBLE

03:00:22.612 --> 03:00:25.982 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT IS KNOWN AS RESTRICTED

03:00:24.914 --> 03:00:28.184 region:rollup2
SCOPE MEDICAID OUR.

03:00:25.982 --> 03:00:30.353 region:rollup2
IN WHICH MEDI CAL PAYS FOR THE

03:00:28.184 --> 03:00:32.355 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY AND PREGNANCY RELATED

03:00:30.353 --> 03:00:34.190 region:rollup2
SERVICES BUT IT WOULDN'T FUNDS

03:00:32.355 --> 03:00:36.459 region:rollup2
NIGHT OF THE.

03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:38.461 region:rollup2
THE PREVENTIVE VISITS ARE OTHER

03:00:36.459 --> 03:00:39.829 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES THAT

03:00:38.461 --> 03:00:41.564 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL COVERS.

03:00:39.829 --> 03:00:43.733 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE WE ESTIMATE THAT

03:00:41.564 --> 03:00:45.268 region:rollup2
THIS APPROACH COULD EXTEND

03:00:43.733 --> 03:00:46.602 region:rollup2
COVERAGE TO ABOUT A MILLION

03:00:45.268 --> 03:00:49.072 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL UNDOCUMENTED

03:00:46.602 --> 03:00:50.773 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANTS ACROSS THE STATE MOST

03:00:49.072 --> 03:00:52.575 region:rollup2
OF WHOM ARE WE DO ESTIMATE ARE

03:00:50.773 --> 03:00:56.746 region:rollup2
ALREADY ENROLLED IN RESTRICTED

03:00:52.575 --> 03:00:59.215 region:rollup2
SCOPE MEDI CAL.

03:00:56.746 --> 03:01:00.116 region:rollup2
THE SECOND APPROACH TO.

03:00:59.215 --> 03:01:01.984 region:rollup2
TARGET.

03:01:00.116 --> 03:01:03.619 region:rollup2
REMAINING UNINSURED

03:01:01.984 --> 03:01:05.455 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.

03:01:03.619 --> 03:01:07.290 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TO PROVIDE HEALTH

03:01:05.455 --> 03:01:08.991 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IN DIVIDEND OF VISUAL

03:01:07.290 --> 03:01:09.258 region:rollup2
MARKET HEALTH INSURANCE

03:01:08.991 --> 03:01:10.960 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES.

03:01:09.258 --> 03:01:12.662 region:rollup2
FOR.

03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:14.464 region:rollup2
INCOME I SAID OF INCOME ELIGIBLE

03:01:12.662 --> 03:01:16.499 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IF THIS

03:01:14.464 --> 03:01:17.934 region:rollup2
WERE MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL

03:01:16.499 --> 03:01:19.402 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES FOR

03:01:17.934 --> 03:01:22.071 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THIS WOULD.

03:01:19.402 --> 03:01:24.240 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD PROVIDE STATE FUNDED

03:01:22.071 --> 03:01:25.641 region:rollup2
TAX CREDITS TO UNDOCUMENTED

03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:27.076 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANTS EARNING BETWEEN ONE

03:01:25.641 --> 03:01:29.011 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT

03:01:27.076 --> 03:01:30.680 region:rollup2
AND FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE

03:01:29.011 --> 03:01:31.981 region:rollup2
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND WE

03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:33.783 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE THAT THIS COULD HELP AN

03:01:31.981 --> 03:01:35.518 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE

03:01:33.783 --> 03:01:37.720 region:rollup2

COVERAGE.

03:01:38.788 --> 03:01:43.426 region:rollup2
ONE WAY TO MODEL IT WOULD BE TO

03:01:40.957 --> 03:01:45.161 region:rollup2
THESE TAX CREDITS WOULD BE TO.

03:01:43.426 --> 03:01:47.630 region:rollup2
MODEL THEM AFTER THE FEDERAL

03:01:45.161 --> 03:01:52.502 region:rollup2
TAX CREDITS WHICH LIMIT PREMIUMS

03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:53.302 region:rollup2
THAT INDIVIDUALS PAY TO A

03:01:53.536 --> 03:01:56.773 region:rollup2
NEXT TO HER I'LL TURN TO.

03:01:55.104 --> 03:01:58.908 region:rollup2
POLICY APPROACHES THAT COULD

03:01:56.773 --> 03:02:01.010 region:rollup2
TARGET THE OTHER REMAINING

.

03:02:05.348 --> 03:02:09.886 region:rollup2
ONE APPROACH HERE WOULD BE TO

03:02:07.583 --> 03:02:12.221 region:rollup2
OFFER STATE WRAPAROUND TAX

03:02:09.886 --> 03:02:13.723 region:rollup2

WITH IT WITH INCOMES THAT ARE

03:02:15.291 --> 03:02:18.294 region:rollup2
TOO HIGH TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID

03:02:16.859 --> 03:02:20.096 region:rollup2
ALSO ABOVE ONE HUNDRED AND

THESE PROTESTS PROPOSAL SORT OF

03:02:22.598 --> 03:02:25.802 region:rollup2
OR THE SET OF PROPOSALS COULD

03:02:24.033 --> 03:02:27.236 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HELP AROUND ONE

03:02:25.802 --> 03:02:30.306 region:rollup2

COMPLEMENTARY BUT SEPARATE.

03:02:33.609 --> 03:02:37.447 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

03:02:35.678 --> 03:02:40.183 region:rollup2
APPROACHES UNDER THIS MORE

03:02:37.447 --> 03:02:41.851 region:rollup2
GENERAL APPROACH ONE WOULD BE TO

03:02:40.183 --> 03:02:42.718 region:rollup2
OFFER STATE FUNDED HEALTH

03:02:41.851 --> 03:02:44.387 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY EARN

03:02:44.387 --> 03:02:48.191 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THE CUT OFF FOR

03:02:45.688 --> 03:02:49.959 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ELIGIBILITY SO. COULD BE

03:02:48.191 --> 03:02:52.428 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED TO FOR EXAMPLE.

03:02:49.959 --> 03:02:53.529 region:rollup2
PROVIDE STATE TAX CREDITS FOR

03:02:52.428 --> 03:02:55.431 region:rollup2

FEDERAL POVERTY LINE.

03:02:58.034 --> 03:03:01.838 region:rollup2
BUT COULD BE MODELED IN A SORT

03:03:00.002 --> 03:03:04.407 region:rollup2
OF SIMILAR FASHION WHERE.

03:03:01.838 --> 03:03:05.208 region:rollup2

03:03:13.549 --> 03:03:17.920 region:rollup2
THE STATE COULD ALSO.

03:03:15.017 --> 03:03:20.223 region:rollup2
OFFER STATE SUBSIDIES THAT.

03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:21.457 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY JUST COMPLEMENT THE

03:03:20.223 --> 03:03:22.892 region:rollup2
FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR

03:03:21.457 --> 03:03:24.260 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY

03:03:22.892 --> 03:03:25.895 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL HEALTH

03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:27.330 region:rollup2
INSURANCE SUBSIDIES AND WHAT

03:03:25.895 --> 03:03:29.799 region:rollup2
THESE COULD DO IS THEY COULD

03:03:27.330 --> 03:03:31.300 region:rollup2
LOWER THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME

03:03:29.799 --> 03:03:34.036 region:rollup2
THAT INDIVIDUALS PAY.

03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:35.972 region:rollup2
FOR PREMIUMS ON THE INSURANCE

03:03:34.036 --> 03:03:37.406 region:rollup2
ON THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET ABOUT

03:03:35.972 --> 03:03:38.941 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE SOMEBODY WHO'S ON

03:03:37.406 --> 03:03:40.476 region:rollup2
WHO EARNS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

03:03:38.941 --> 03:03:42.345 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

03:03:40.476 --> 03:03:43.479 region:rollup2
LINE LIMITED TO TEN PERCENT OF

03:03:42.345 --> 03:03:45.581 region:rollup2
THEIR INCOME IN TERMS OF THE

03:03:43.479 --> 03:03:47.350 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS THEY PAY. A STATE TAX

03:03:45.581 --> 03:03:49.819 region:rollup2
CREDIT COULD FOR EXAMPLE LOWER

03:03:47.350 --> 03:03:52.188 region:rollup2
LOWER THAT PERCENTAGE TO MAYBE

03:03:49.819 --> 03:03:53.789 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME.

03:03:52.188 --> 03:03:56.025 region:rollup2
AND THEN I'LL FINALLY TOUCH ON A

03:03:53.789 --> 03:03:56.926 region:rollup2
STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE STATE

03:03:56.025 --> 03:03:58.728 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

03:04:06.669 --> 03:04:09.739 region:rollup2
BUT WHICH WAS.

03:04:07.837 --> 03:04:11.741 region:rollup2
RECENTLY THE PENALTY OF WHICH

03:04:09.739 --> 03:04:14.176 region:rollup2

MOST RECENT FEDERAL TAX BILL.

03:04:14.176 --> 03:04:18.548 region:rollup2
BEGINNING IN TWENTY NINETEEN.

03:04:16.579 --> 03:04:20.383 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT OF A STATE TAX

03:04:18.548 --> 03:04:22.418 region:rollup2
CREDIT IT WOULD COULD THAT COULD

03:04:20.383 --> 03:04:24.887 region:rollup2
REPLACE THE EXPIRING FEDERAL

03:04:22.418 --> 03:04:25.421 region:rollup2
MANDATE PENALTY WOULD BE THAT IT

03:04:24.887 --> 03:04:27.323 region:rollup2
COULD.

03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:29.058 region:rollup2
PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR

03:04:27.323 --> 03:04:31.093 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY THE

CARE COVERAGE.

03:04:33.629 --> 03:04:36.799 region:rollup2
TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT ON THE

PENALTIES THAT WERE PAID BY

03:04:36.799 --> 03:04:40.536 region:rollup2

03:04:52.848 --> 03:04:57.286 region:rollup2
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PORTION.

03:04:55.084 --> 03:04:58.087 region:rollup2
OF OUR REMARKS HAPPY TO TAKE

03:04:57.286 --> 03:05:02.525 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BUT I'LL TURN OVER TO

03:04:58.087 --> 03:05:03.426 region:rollup2
RYAN MILLER.

03:05:02.525 --> 03:05:04.994 region:rollup2
AND RYAN MILLER FROM THE LA NOW.

03:05:03.426 --> 03:05:06.762 region:rollup2
.

03:05:04.994 --> 03:05:08.597 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE DIVE INTO SOME OF THE.

03:05:06.762 --> 03:05:10.299 region:rollup2
FRONT FINANCING OPTIONS THAT

03:05:08.597 --> 03:05:12.301 region:rollup2
WE'VE PREPARED I WANTED TO HIT A

03:05:10.299 --> 03:05:13.736 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF INTRODUCTORY POINTS.

03:05:12.301 --> 03:05:15.037 region:rollup2
FIRST WHILE WHILE WE WALK

03:05:13.736 --> 03:05:17.807 region:rollup2
THROUGH VARIOUS TAXES WE

03:05:15.037 --> 03:05:19.508 region:rollup2
PROVIDED ESTIMATES OF WHAT RATES

03:05:17.807 --> 03:05:21.877 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RAISE AN

03:05:19.508 --> 03:05:23.446 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL. TEN BILLION DOLLARS

03:05:21.877 --> 03:05:25.348 region:rollup2
ON THE LOW END AND TWO HUNDRED

03:05:23.446 --> 03:05:27.583 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS ON THE HIGH END.

03:05:25.348 --> 03:05:29.685 region:rollup2
AND WE WE PICKED THOSE NUMBERS

03:05:27.583 --> 03:05:31.454 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT.

03:05:29.685 --> 03:05:31.787 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE PROPOSALS BEING

03:05:31.454 --> 03:05:33.522 region:rollup2
THROWN AROUND.

03:05:31.787 --> 03:05:34.423 region:rollup2
.

03:05:33.522 --> 03:05:36.492 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT.

03:05:34.423 --> 03:05:37.493 region:rollup2
MISTER JOHNSON DISCUSSED IN

03:05:36.492 --> 03:05:38.594 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE SEVERAL BILLION

03:05:37.493 --> 03:05:39.996 region:rollup2
DOLLAR RANGE AND MORE

03:05:38.594 --> 03:05:42.064 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE

03:05:39.996 --> 03:05:44.600 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE. TWO

03:05:42.064 --> 03:05:46.802 region:rollup2
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR RANGE.

03:05:44.600 --> 03:05:48.738 region:rollup2
AS MISTER GRAVES MENTIONED.

03:05:46.802 --> 03:05:49.905 region:rollup2
TAX INCREASES GENERALLY REQUIRE

03:05:48.738 --> 03:05:50.940 region:rollup2
A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE

03:05:49.905 --> 03:05:52.475 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

03:05:50.940 --> 03:05:54.410 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN SOME CASES.

03:05:52.475 --> 03:05:55.544 region:rollup2
CHANGES WOULD REQUIRE GOING TO

03:05:54.410 --> 03:05:57.313 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS

03:05:55.544 --> 03:05:59.415 region:rollup2
I GENERALLY SPEAKING MODIFYING

03:05:57.313 --> 03:06:01.283 region:rollup2
THE PROPERTY TAX FOR EXAMPLE.

03:05:59.415 --> 03:06:02.151 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE AMENDING THE

03:06:01.283 --> 03:06:04.186 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION AND A AND A

03:06:02.151 --> 03:06:06.956 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE VOTE.

03:06:04.186 --> 03:06:09.291 region:rollup2
AND I WANTED ALSO HAD ON.

03:06:06.956 --> 03:06:10.826 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TAX CHANGES THAT WERE

03:06:09.291 --> 03:06:13.362 region:rollup2
RECENTLY MADE.

03:06:10.826 --> 03:06:14.964 region:rollup2
ITS IT THE THE THE THE FEDERAL

03:06:13.362 --> 03:06:15.665 region:rollup2
BILL IS VERY COMPLEX THERE'S A

03:06:14.964 --> 03:06:17.533 region:rollup2
LOT OF.

03:06:15.665 --> 03:06:19.301 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS THAT WERE WORKING

03:06:17.533 --> 03:06:20.436 region:rollup2
FOR A LOT OF THE FRANCHISE TAX

03:06:19.301 --> 03:06:21.037 region:rollup2
BOARD IS TAKING A LOOK AT THE

03:06:20.436 --> 03:06:23.105 region:rollup2
EFFECTS.

03:06:21.037 --> 03:06:24.940 region:rollup2
.

03:06:23.105 --> 03:06:25.174 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THE PROVISIONS THAT

03:06:24.940 --> 03:06:27.843 region:rollup2
SEEMS.

03:06:25.174 --> 03:06:28.844 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY NOTABLE FOR THIS

03:06:27.843 --> 03:06:31.580 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IS THE.

03:06:28.844 --> 03:06:33.616 region:rollup2
BUT IS THE CAP ON THE STATE AND

03:06:31.580 --> 03:06:34.216 region:rollup2
LOCAL TAX DEDUCTIONS.

03:06:33.616 --> 03:06:35.251 region:rollup2
I'M SURE THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF

03:06:34.216 --> 03:06:36.485 region:rollup2
IT.

03:06:35.251 --> 03:06:38.320 region:rollup2
.

03:06:36.485 --> 03:06:39.388 region:rollup2
I TAXPAYERS CAN DEDUCT UP TO TEN

03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:41.123 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS OF EITHER

03:06:39.388 --> 03:06:43.059 region:rollup2
PERSONAL INCOME TAX OR SALES TAX

03:06:41.123 --> 03:06:44.827 region:rollup2
PLUS PROPERTY TAXES.

03:06:43.059 --> 03:06:45.327 region:rollup2
SO WHERE AS LAST YEAR.

03:06:44.827 --> 03:06:47.029 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE OPTIONS WILL

03:06:45.327 --> 03:06:49.432 region:rollup2
DISCUSS.

03:06:47.029 --> 03:06:51.467 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE ALLOWED A TAXPAYERS

03:06:49.432 --> 03:06:53.135 region:rollup2
TO DEDUCT THE INCREASE ON THEIR

03:06:51.467 --> 03:06:54.770 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TAX BILLS.

03:06:53.135 --> 03:06:55.304 region:rollup2
MANY TAXPAYERS.

03:06:54.770 --> 03:06:56.005 region:rollup2
NO LONGER WOULD HAVE THAT

03:06:55.304 --> 03:06:57.106 region:rollup2
OPTION.

03:06:56.005 --> 03:07:00.042 region:rollup2
.

03:06:57.106 --> 03:07:01.510 region:rollup2
SO.

03:07:00.042 --> 03:07:02.812 region:rollup2
FIRST WE'LL DISCUSS THE PERSONAL

INCOME TAX THE PERSONAL INCOME

03:07:02.812 --> 03:07:06.182 region:rollup2

03:07:16.292 --> 03:07:19.929 region:rollup2
I AND THE STATE ASSESSES.

03:07:17.827 --> 03:07:21.564 region:rollup2
MARGINAL RATES THAT RANGE FROM

03:07:19.929 --> 03:07:24.066 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT TO TWELVE POINT

03:07:21.564 --> 03:07:25.868 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT. AND THEY INCREASE

03:07:24.066 --> 03:07:27.336 region:rollup2
WITH INCREASES IN INCOME.

03:07:25.868 --> 03:07:30.172 region:rollup2
AS WE KNOW THE HAND OUT THERE

03:07:27.336 --> 03:07:32.241 region:rollup2
IS ALSO A ONE PERCENT SURCHARGE.

03:07:30.172 --> 03:07:33.876 region:rollup2
FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE

03:07:32.241 --> 03:07:36.145 region:rollup2
RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH.

03:07:33.876 --> 03:07:37.580 region:rollup2
BUT WE GENERALLY DON'T I HAVE

03:07:36.145 --> 03:07:39.648 region:rollup2
THOSE REFLECTED IN OUR.

03:07:37.580 --> 03:07:41.350 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES AND TABLES HERE.

03:07:39.648 --> 03:07:42.985 region:rollup2
SO THE TWO MAIN WAYS THAT YOU

03:07:41.350 --> 03:07:43.419 region:rollup2
CAN INCREASE PERSONAL INCOME TAX

03:07:42.985 --> 03:07:45.855 region:rollup2
REVENUE.

03:07:43.419 --> 03:07:46.689 region:rollup2
ARE TO EITHER INCREASE RATES

03:07:45.855 --> 03:07:49.158 region:rollup2
AND OR.

03:07:46.689 --> 03:07:50.826 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE OR MODIFY TAX

03:07:49.158 --> 03:07:52.194 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES LIKE THE MORTGAGE

03:07:50.826 --> 03:07:54.830 region:rollup2
INTEREST DEDUCTION.

03:07:52.194 --> 03:07:56.465 region:rollup2
FOR THIS HAND OUT WE LOOKED AT

03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:57.633 region:rollup2
WHAT TYPES OF RATE INCREASES

03:07:56.465 --> 03:08:00.002 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NECESSARY.

03:07:57.633 --> 03:08:01.370 region:rollup2
.

03:08:00.002 --> 03:08:03.005 region:rollup2
TO RAISE OTHER TENANT TO HONOR

03:08:01.370 --> 03:08:03.539 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN LOOK AND

03:08:03.005 --> 03:08:05.274 region:rollup2
ASSUMING THAT.

03:08:03.539 --> 03:08:06.509 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE AT ACROSS THE

03:08:05.274 --> 03:08:08.778 region:rollup2
BOARD.

03:08:06.509 --> 03:08:10.179 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN ALL RATES NOW.

03:08:08.778 --> 03:08:12.214 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE OPTIONS

03:08:10.179 --> 03:08:13.616 region:rollup2
TO SORT OF CONCENTRATE THAT TAX

03:08:12.214 --> 03:08:15.284 region:rollup2
INCREASE ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF

03:08:13.616 --> 03:08:16.986 region:rollup2
THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION.

03:08:15.284 --> 03:08:17.520 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN WE WE KIND OF LOOKED

03:08:16.986 --> 03:08:20.256 region:rollup2
AT A. AN ACROSS THE BOARD

03:08:17.520 --> 03:08:25.060 region:rollup2
OPTION.

03:08:20.256 --> 03:08:25.794 region:rollup2
.

03:08:25.060 --> 03:08:27.630 region:rollup2
SIR ALL KNOW THAT.

03:08:25.794 --> 03:08:28.898 region:rollup2
THAT THE HANDOUTS THAT THEN THE

03:08:27.630 --> 03:08:31.066 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAVE.

03:08:28.898 --> 03:08:32.201 region:rollup2
ARE UPDATED TO REFLECT THE A

03:08:31.066 --> 03:08:33.435 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT WE FOUND IN IN

03:08:32.201 --> 03:08:34.537 region:rollup2
THEIR TABLE.

03:08:33.435 --> 03:08:35.838 region:rollup2
EARLIER THIS MORNING BUT

03:08:34.537 --> 03:08:37.640 region:rollup2
ANYBODY WHO HAD PICKED UP THE

03:08:35.838 --> 03:08:40.009 region:rollup2
HAND OUT FROM OUTSIDE THE ROOM.

03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:40.743 region:rollup2
CAN FIND THE CORRECTED VERSION

03:08:40.009 --> 03:08:43.646 region:rollup2
ON OUR WEBSITE.

03:08:40.743 --> 03:08:45.080 region:rollup2
.

03:08:43.646 --> 03:08:46.482 region:rollup2
SO WE ESTIMATE THAT IT THAT IT

03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:47.616 region:rollup2
INCREASE REQUIRED FOR TEN

03:08:46.482 --> 03:08:49.151 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS WOULD REQUIRE A

03:08:47.616 --> 03:08:50.619 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT

03:08:49.151 --> 03:08:52.688 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN RATES ACROSS THE

03:08:50.619 --> 03:08:54.390 region:rollup2
BOARD SO FOR EXAMPLE. I THE TOP

03:08:52.688 --> 03:08:55.724 region:rollup2
TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT RATE

03:08:54.390 --> 03:08:57.226 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE TO

03:08:55.724 --> 03:08:59.695 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT.

03:08:57.226 --> 03:09:01.096 region:rollup2
.

03:08:59.695 --> 03:09:02.298 region:rollup2
I DON'T IN ORDER TO RAISE TWO

03:09:01.096 --> 03:09:03.933 region:rollup2
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS HOWEVER

03:09:02.298 --> 03:09:05.634 region:rollup2
THE RATES WOULD HAVE TO BE ABOUT

03:09:03.933 --> 03:09:07.803 region:rollup2
THREE TIMES HIGHER.

03:09:05.634 --> 03:09:09.605 region:rollup2
I AM IS REFLECTED ON THE TABLE

03:09:07.803 --> 03:09:11.540 region:rollup2
THE CORRECTED VERSION THAT IS.

03:09:09.605 --> 03:09:12.508 region:rollup2
THE TOP MARGINAL RATE ON THE

03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:13.776 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR

03:09:12.508 --> 03:09:16.412 region:rollup2
OPTION WOULD BE.

03:09:13.776 --> 03:09:17.846 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIRTY SIX PERCENT.

03:09:16.412 --> 03:09:18.881 region:rollup2
AND TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF

03:09:17.846 --> 03:09:21.183 region:rollup2
CONTEXT THERE.

03:09:18.881 --> 03:09:21.684 region:rollup2
WHEN COMBINED WITH THE NEW TOP

03:09:21.183 --> 03:09:25.120 region:rollup2
FEDERAL RATE.

03:09:21.684 --> 03:09:26.088 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE RECENT FEDERAL.

03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:28.123 region:rollup2
BILL.

03:09:26.088 --> 03:09:29.358 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD RESULT IN A COMBINED

03:09:28.123 --> 03:09:31.393 region:rollup2
STATE AND FEDERAL RATED OVER

03:09:29.358 --> 03:09:33.295 region:rollup2
SEVENTY PERCENT.

03:09:31.393 --> 03:09:33.562 region:rollup2
THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME TO

03:09:33.295 --> 03:09:35.831 region:rollup2
MENTION.

03:09:33.562 --> 03:09:38.234 region:rollup2
THAT SOME OF THESE OPTIONS

03:09:35.831 --> 03:09:39.768 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD HAVE LARGE TAXPAYER

03:09:38.234 --> 03:09:41.370 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES IN IN FOR

03:09:39.768 --> 03:09:43.305 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE HERE.

03:09:41.370 --> 03:09:44.673 region:rollup2
ONE CAN IMAGINE THAT WITH.

03:09:43.305 --> 03:09:45.908 region:rollup2
COMBINED RATE OF OVER SEVENTY

03:09:44.673 --> 03:09:47.042 region:rollup2
PERCENT THERE WOULD LIKELY BE

03:09:45.908 --> 03:09:49.278 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE.

03:09:47.042 --> 03:09:51.947 region:rollup2
FINDING ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE.

03:09:49.278 --> 03:09:53.315 region:rollup2
AND AND I MENTION THAT AS WELL

03:09:51.947 --> 03:09:54.883 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE PRODUCED.

03:09:53.315 --> 03:09:55.584 region:rollup2
STATIC ESTIMATES THE DON'T

03:09:54.883 --> 03:09:58.587 region:rollup2
ASSUME.

03:09:55.584 --> 03:10:00.222 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY CHANGES

03:09:58.587 --> 03:10:02.524 region:rollup2
AND HOW TAXPAYERS RESPOND.

03:10:00.222 --> 03:10:04.093 region:rollup2
AND SO PARTICULARLY AT THE HIGH

03:10:02.524 --> 03:10:05.527 region:rollup2
END OF OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING

03:10:04.093 --> 03:10:08.163 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS PRESENTATION.

03:10:05.527 --> 03:10:09.665 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE HUGE UNCERTAINTY.

03:10:08.163 --> 03:10:11.233 region:rollup2
RESULTING FROM FROM THESE

03:10:09.665 --> 03:10:13.135 region:rollup2
FACTORS.

03:10:11.233 --> 03:10:14.603 region:rollup2
AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT

03:10:13.135 --> 03:10:16.605 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT WOULD

03:10:14.603 --> 03:10:18.307 region:rollup2
BE RAISED IF YOU DID UP PURSUE

03:10:16.605 --> 03:10:18.540 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE OPTIONS WOULD.

03:10:18.307 --> 03:10:20.909 region:rollup2
WOULD.

03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:21.410 region:rollup2
VERY FROM THESE ESTIMATES BY

03:10:20.909 --> 03:10:24.146 region:rollup2
MANY TENS OF BILLIONS OF

03:10:21.410 --> 03:10:25.414 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

03:10:24.146 --> 03:10:27.283 region:rollup2
SO NEXT WILL DESCRIBE THE

03:10:25.414 --> 03:10:28.284 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX AND IT'S THE MAIN

03:10:27.283 --> 03:10:30.085 region:rollup2
LOCAL TAX SOURCE.

03:10:28.284 --> 03:10:32.988 region:rollup2
.

03:10:30.085 --> 03:10:33.155 region:rollup2
.

03:10:32.988 --> 03:10:35.291 region:rollup2
THE.

03:10:33.155 --> 03:10:37.026 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN.

03:10:35.291 --> 03:10:38.727 region:rollup2
MAILED A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO

03:10:37.026 --> 03:10:39.762 region:rollup2
THE PROPERTY TAX IT CAPS THE.

03:10:38.727 --> 03:10:41.463 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX RATE AT ONE

03:10:39.762 --> 03:10:42.531 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

03:10:41.463 --> 03:10:43.365 region:rollup2
AND ALSO.

03:10:42.531 --> 03:10:45.934 region:rollup2
AFFECTS HOW.

03:10:43.365 --> 03:10:47.336 region:rollup2
HOW ASSESSED VALUES CAN GROW?

03:10:45.934 --> 03:10:48.637 region:rollup2
IT LIMITS.

03:10:47.336 --> 03:10:50.372 region:rollup2
GROWTH NEXT BEEN ASSESSED

03:10:48.637 --> 03:10:52.141 region:rollup2
VALUES TO THE GREATER INFLATION

03:10:50.372 --> 03:10:53.375 region:rollup2
AND TWO PERCENT AND SO. THAT

03:10:52.141 --> 03:10:54.276 region:rollup2
KIND OF USMOVES OUT THE TAX

03:10:53.375 --> 03:10:56.345 region:rollup2
BASE.

03:10:54.276 --> 03:10:58.247 region:rollup2
.

03:10:56.345 --> 03:10:59.581 region:rollup2
SO FOR OPTIONS FOR ATTACKS THAT

03:10:58.247 --> 03:11:01.250 region:rollup2
THE PARTY TAX YOU CAN EITHER

03:10:59.581 --> 03:11:02.484 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE TAX RATE OR YOU CAN

03:11:01.250 --> 03:11:04.753 region:rollup2
MAKE CHANGES TO THAT ASSESSMENT

03:11:02.484 --> 03:11:07.957 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE SOME HAVE UP

03:11:04.753 --> 03:11:09.525 region:rollup2
PROPOSED A SPLIT ROLE WHEREBY. A

03:11:07.957 --> 03:11:11.493 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ARE

03:11:09.525 --> 03:11:12.761 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO BE TAXED AT THE IN

03:11:11.493 --> 03:11:14.563 region:rollup2
THE UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE

03:11:12.761 --> 03:11:15.831 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES WILL BE

03:11:14.563 --> 03:11:18.133 region:rollup2
TAXED AT MARKET VALUES.

03:11:15.831 --> 03:11:18.767 region:rollup2
.

03:11:18.133 --> 03:11:21.370 region:rollup2
FOR THIS.

03:11:18.767 --> 03:11:23.305 region:rollup2
HEARING HOWEVER WE LOOKED AT.

03:11:21.370 --> 03:11:25.507 region:rollup2
JUST AN INCREASE IN TAX RATES

03:11:23.305 --> 03:11:27.509 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A CHANGE IN THE TAX BASE

03:11:25.507 --> 03:11:29.244 region:rollup2
OR IN THE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM.

03:11:27.509 --> 03:11:31.013 region:rollup2
NOW WE ESTIMATED THAT A POINT

03:11:29.244 --> 03:11:32.181 region:rollup2
TWO PERCENT INCREASE WOULD BE

03:11:31.013 --> 03:11:33.882 region:rollup2
NEEDED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TEN

03:11:32.181 --> 03:11:35.417 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD

03:11:33.882 --> 03:11:36.518 region:rollup2
BRING THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE.

03:11:35.417 --> 03:11:37.653 region:rollup2
TAX RATE TO.

03:11:36.518 --> 03:11:39.188 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE ONE POINT THREE

03:11:37.653 --> 03:11:40.856 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

03:11:39.188 --> 03:11:42.091 region:rollup2
BUT IT BUT A TWO HUNDRED

03:11:40.856 --> 03:11:43.158 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ON THE

03:11:42.091 --> 03:11:44.693 region:rollup2
OTHER HAND WOULD REQUIRE AN

03:11:43.158 --> 03:11:45.961 region:rollup2
INCREASE OF THREE POINT SEVEN

03:11:44.693 --> 03:11:46.729 region:rollup2
PERCENT WHICH WOULD BRING THE

03:11:45.961 --> 03:11:50.466 region:rollup2
AVERAGE RATES ALMOST FIVE

03:11:46.729 --> 03:11:50.833 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

03:11:50.466 --> 03:11:53.302 region:rollup2
NEXT.

03:11:50.833 --> 03:11:55.070 region:rollup2
IS THE SALES AND USE TAX.

03:11:53.302 --> 03:11:57.272 region:rollup2
THIS IS ATAXES COLLECTED BY

03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:59.475 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND IS DISTRIBUTED TO

03:11:57.272 --> 03:12:01.243 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

03:11:59.475 --> 03:12:02.277 region:rollup2
THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE RATE IS

03:12:01.243 --> 03:12:03.879 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY EIGHT POINT FIVE

03:12:02.277 --> 03:12:04.279 region:rollup2
PERCENT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:12:03.879 --> 03:12:06.582 region:rollup2
CAN.

03:12:04.279 --> 03:12:08.016 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO ADD ON RATES.

03:12:06.582 --> 03:12:09.284 region:rollup2
SO THAT TELLS TAX CAN VARY

03:12:08.016 --> 03:12:10.619 region:rollup2
CONSIDERABLY IN SOME PARTS OF

03:12:09.284 --> 03:12:12.654 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

03:12:10.619 --> 03:12:13.822 region:rollup2
.

03:12:12.654 --> 03:12:15.057 region:rollup2
NOW IN THE SALES TAX.

03:12:13.822 --> 03:12:16.959 region:rollup2
ANOTHER OPTION THAT YOU CAN

03:12:15.057 --> 03:12:17.659 region:rollup2
CONSIDER IS TO CHANGE THE TAX

03:12:16.959 --> 03:12:18.961 region:rollup2
BASE FOR EXAMPLE.

03:12:17.659 --> 03:12:19.895 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

03:12:18.961 --> 03:12:21.730 region:rollup2
EXTENDING THE SALES TAX

03:12:19.895 --> 03:12:23.399 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

03:12:21.730 --> 03:12:25.934 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NOTE.

03:12:23.399 --> 03:12:27.403 region:rollup2
THAT. THAT THE SALES TAX COULD

03:12:25.934 --> 03:12:29.605 region:rollup2
ALSO BE EXTENDED TO.

03:12:27.403 --> 03:12:31.140 region:rollup2
BE APPLIED TO A CANDY SNACK

03:12:29.605 --> 03:12:31.974 region:rollup2
FOODS AND BOTTLED WATER BUT THAT

03:12:31.140 --> 03:12:33.275 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ANOTHER OPTION THAT

03:12:31.974 --> 03:12:35.310 region:rollup2
REQUIRE GOING THE VOTERS BECAUSE

03:12:33.275 --> 03:12:37.880 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SPECIFIC. PROVISION IN

03:12:35.310 --> 03:12:40.783 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTION ABOUT THAT.

03:12:37.880 --> 03:12:42.518 region:rollup2
.

03:12:40.783 --> 03:12:43.519 region:rollup2
SO WE AGAIN.

03:12:42.518 --> 03:12:44.853 region:rollup2
MADE NO.

03:12:43.519 --> 03:12:46.321 region:rollup2
ASSUME NO CHANGE IN THE TAX

03:12:44.853 --> 03:12:47.923 region:rollup2
BASE.

03:12:46.321 --> 03:12:49.758 region:rollup2
AND JUST LOOK AT WHAT KINDS OF

03:12:47.923 --> 03:12:51.393 region:rollup2
RATES WOULD BE NEEDED TO RAISE

03:12:49.758 --> 03:12:53.061 region:rollup2
THE ADDITIONAL AYE REVENUE.

03:12:51.393 --> 03:12:54.396 region:rollup2
FOR TEN BILLION DOLLARS WE

03:12:53.061 --> 03:12:55.731 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE

03:12:54.396 --> 03:12:57.199 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FOUR

03:12:55.731 --> 03:12:59.501 region:rollup2
PERCENT. AND THAT WOULD BRING

03:12:57.199 --> 03:13:01.503 region:rollup2
THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE SALES TAX

03:12:59.501 --> 03:13:02.838 region:rollup2
RATE TO ABOUT TEN PERCENT.

03:13:01.503 --> 03:13:04.506 region:rollup2
THAT ON THE OTHER HAND.

03:13:02.838 --> 03:13:05.607 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS

03:13:04.506 --> 03:13:06.742 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE AN INCREASE OF

03:13:05.607 --> 03:13:08.077 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENTAGE

03:13:06.742 --> 03:13:09.778 region:rollup2
POINTS.

03:13:08.077 --> 03:13:11.146 region:rollup2
I WHICH WOULD BRING THE AVERAGE

03:13:09.778 --> 03:13:15.117 region:rollup2
SALES TAX RATE TO ABOUT THIRTY

03:13:11.146 --> 03:13:16.018 region:rollup2
SEVEN PERCENT.

03:13:15.117 --> 03:13:18.654 region:rollup2
ANOTHER OPTION.

03:13:16.018 --> 03:13:20.456 region:rollup2
THAT WE INCLUDE IS IS A PAYROLL

03:13:18.654 --> 03:13:22.491 region:rollup2
TAX ON THE STATE HAS A FEW SMALL

03:13:20.456 --> 03:13:24.226 region:rollup2
PAYROLL TAXES FOR EXAMPLE THAT

03:13:22.491 --> 03:13:26.795 region:rollup2
ARE LEVIED FOR. REALLY DONE

03:13:24.226 --> 03:13:28.931 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT ASSURANCE.

03:13:26.795 --> 03:13:30.732 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO

03:13:28.931 --> 03:13:32.668 region:rollup2
LEVEES PAYROLL TAXES FOR EXAMPLE

03:13:30.732 --> 03:13:34.837 region:rollup2
FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND THEY

03:13:32.668 --> 03:13:36.672 region:rollup2
LOVE IT UP TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT.

03:13:34.837 --> 03:13:38.173 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IN. AND.

03:13:36.672 --> 03:13:39.608 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT WAS A

03:13:38.173 --> 03:13:40.409 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND FOUR

03:13:39.608 --> 03:13:42.377 region:rollup2
HUNDRED.

03:13:40.409 --> 03:13:44.513 region:rollup2
BUT THE STATE COULD CHOOSE TO

03:13:42.377 --> 03:13:45.147 region:rollup2
APPLY IT TO ALL INCOME IT

03:13:44.513 --> 03:13:45.781 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A

03:13:45.147 --> 03:13:46.615 region:rollup2
CAP.

03:13:45.781 --> 03:13:48.183 region:rollup2
ON THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO

03:13:46.615 --> 03:13:49.952 region:rollup2
MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHAT RATE TO

03:13:48.183 --> 03:13:51.420 region:rollup2
CHARGE IN COULD CONCEIVABLY

03:13:49.952 --> 03:13:53.856 region:rollup2
CHARGE DIFFERENT RATES.

03:13:51.420 --> 03:13:56.291 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS.

03:13:53.856 --> 03:13:57.559 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATED THAT AN INCREASE

03:13:56.291 --> 03:13:59.228 region:rollup2
OF TEN BILLION DOLLARS WOULD

03:13:57.559 --> 03:14:01.530 region:rollup2
REQUIRE PAYROLL TAX RATE OF ZERO

03:13:59.228 --> 03:14:02.965 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT PERCENT.

03:14:01.530 --> 03:14:03.799 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS INCREASE OF TWO

03:14:02.965 --> 03:14:04.933 region:rollup2
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WOULD

03:14:03.799 --> 03:14:07.769 region:rollup2
REQUIRE RATE OF ROUGHLY FIFTEEN

03:14:04.933 --> 03:14:09.438 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

03:14:07.769 --> 03:14:10.339 region:rollup2
FINALLY AN OPTION THAT WE

03:14:09.438 --> 03:14:11.640 region:rollup2
INCLUDED.

03:14:10.339 --> 03:14:13.675 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY.

03:14:11.640 --> 03:14:15.744 region:rollup2
SOME RESEARCHERS.

03:14:13.675 --> 03:14:18.046 region:rollup2
GROSS RECEIPTS TAX.

03:14:15.744 --> 03:14:19.481 region:rollup2
A GROSS RECEIPTS TAXES A LITTLE

03:14:18.046 --> 03:14:21.149 region:rollup2
BIT SIMILAR TO A SALES TAX ITS

03:14:19.481 --> 03:14:22.885 region:rollup2
ITS ASSESSED ON ALL BUSINESS

03:14:21.149 --> 03:14:24.953 region:rollup2
SALES ENDING AND INCLUDES GOODS

03:14:22.885 --> 03:14:26.889 region:rollup2
AND SERVICES.

03:14:24.953 --> 03:14:28.490 region:rollup2
BUT WHEREAS THE SALES TAX IS

03:14:26.889 --> 03:14:30.192 region:rollup2
COLLECTED AT THE RETAIL LEVEL

03:14:28.490 --> 03:14:31.860 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LIKE AT A STORE.

03:14:30.192 --> 03:14:32.728 region:rollup2
THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX IS

03:14:31.860 --> 03:14:34.530 region:rollup2
COLLECTED AT ALL STAGES OF

03:14:32.728 --> 03:14:35.964 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION.

03:14:34.530 --> 03:14:36.498 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU COULD IMAGINE FOR

03:14:35.964 --> 03:14:39.201 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

03:14:36.498 --> 03:14:42.037 region:rollup2
A CAR MANUFACTURER THAT IS.

03:14:39.201 --> 03:14:43.138 region:rollup2
SOURCING SEAT BELTS AND BRAKE

03:14:42.037 --> 03:14:45.174 region:rollup2
PADS AND ALL KINDS OF PARTS IN

03:14:43.138 --> 03:14:46.275 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLING A CAR THERE THEIR

03:14:45.174 --> 03:14:47.743 region:rollup2
SOURCING THESE PRODUCTS FROM

03:14:46.275 --> 03:14:50.612 region:rollup2
OTHER COMPANIES.

03:14:47.743 --> 03:14:52.147 region:rollup2
AT EACH STAGE OF THAT PROCESS

03:14:50.612 --> 03:14:53.415 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY PREPARE THE SEAT BELTS

03:14:52.147 --> 03:14:54.783 region:rollup2
AND OTHER PARTS THE GROSS

03:14:53.415 --> 03:14:57.219 region:rollup2
RECEIPTS TAX WOULD BE ASSESSED

03:14:54.783 --> 03:14:59.621 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

03:14:57.219 --> 03:15:01.557 region:rollup2
AND THIS CAUSES SOME.

03:14:59.621 --> 03:15:03.592 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE ECONOMIC

03:15:01.557 --> 03:15:05.661 region:rollup2
EFFECTS BECAUSE IT WOULD PROVIDE

03:15:03.592 --> 03:15:06.028 region:rollup2
AN INCENTIVE FOR FIRMS.

03:15:05.661 --> 03:15:08.730 region:rollup2
TO.

03:15:06.028 --> 03:15:10.899 region:rollup2
STAR INSTEAD TO PRODUCE ALL OF

03:15:08.730 --> 03:15:12.100 region:rollup2
THOSE MATERIALS THEMSELVES SO AS

03:15:10.899 --> 03:15:13.735 region:rollup2
TO AVOID THE TAX NEXT

03:15:12.100 --> 03:15:16.672 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY A PROBLEM WITH A

03:15:13.735 --> 03:15:18.574 region:rollup2
LARGER TAX RATE.

03:15:16.672 --> 03:15:20.809 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATED THAT A GROSS

03:15:18.574 --> 03:15:22.444 region:rollup2
RECEIPTS TAX OF ZERO POINT TWO

03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:22.945 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT WOULD BE NECESSARY

03:15:22.444 --> 03:15:25.047 region:rollup2
TO RAISE THE TEN BILLION

03:15:22.945 --> 03:15:27.316 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

03:15:25.047 --> 03:15:28.483 region:rollup2
BUT IN ORDER TO RAISE TWO

03:15:27.316 --> 03:15:29.851 region:rollup2
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WE

03:15:28.483 --> 03:15:32.854 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

03:15:29.851 --> 03:15:34.423 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY FIVE PERCENT.

03:15:32.854 --> 03:15:36.058 region:rollup2
SO IN THE END OF THE.

03:15:34.423 --> 03:15:37.726 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION HERE WE HAD ON A

03:15:36.058 --> 03:15:39.962 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF.

03:15:37.726 --> 03:15:41.630 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS TWO WAY.

03:15:39.962 --> 03:15:42.731 region:rollup2
.

03:15:41.630 --> 03:15:43.165 region:rollup2
AS YOU CONSIDER VARIOUS

03:15:42.731 --> 03:15:45.467 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS.

03:15:43.165 --> 03:15:47.035 region:rollup2
.

03:15:45.467 --> 03:15:48.937 region:rollup2
I'M NOT GOING TO COVER EVERYONE

03:15:47.035 --> 03:15:50.973 region:rollup2
BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION.

03:15:48.937 --> 03:15:52.474 region:rollup2
NEAR THE BOTTOM OF PAGE

03:15:50.973 --> 03:15:54.676 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN HERE.

03:15:52.474 --> 03:15:56.411 region:rollup2
REVENUE VOLATILITY AND WHICH

03:15:54.676 --> 03:15:57.779 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN A BIG HOT ISSUE IN THE

03:15:56.411 --> 03:15:58.747 region:rollup2
STATE BUDGET FOR THE LAST TWENTY

03:15:57.779 --> 03:16:01.016 region:rollup2
YEARS OR SO.

03:15:58.747 --> 03:16:02.384 region:rollup2
.

03:16:01.016 --> 03:16:03.885 region:rollup2
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW WITH THE

03:16:02.384 --> 03:16:05.387 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND OF THE GENERAL FUND

03:16:03.885 --> 03:16:06.755 region:rollup2
RELYING SO MUCH IN THE PERSONAL

03:16:05.387 --> 03:16:08.256 region:rollup2
INCOME TAX WHICH IS A HIGHLY

03:16:06.755 --> 03:16:10.058 region:rollup2
VOLATILE SOURCE.

03:16:08.256 --> 03:16:12.227 region:rollup2
HAS MADE BUDGETING CHALLENGING

03:16:10.058 --> 03:16:13.829 region:rollup2
BECAUSE REVENUES CAN CAN KIND OF

03:16:12.227 --> 03:16:15.731 region:rollup2
BOOM AND BUST.

03:16:13.829 --> 03:16:17.265 region:rollup2
AND IN THE PAST.

03:16:15.731 --> 03:16:18.500 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS COMMITTED TO AN

03:16:17.265 --> 03:16:20.135 region:rollup2
UNSUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF SPENDING

03:16:18.500 --> 03:16:21.870 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S.

03:16:20.135 --> 03:16:22.638 region:rollup2
PART OF THE REASON THAT THE

03:16:21.870 --> 03:16:23.805 region:rollup2
STATE HAD.

03:16:22.638 --> 03:16:27.309 region:rollup2
SUCH SIGNIFICANT BUDGET

03:16:23.805 --> 03:16:29.177 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS IN THE TWO THOUSANDS.

03:16:27.309 --> 03:16:30.612 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO THAT WERE OF

03:16:29.177 --> 03:16:31.980 region:rollup2
THAT WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS IN

03:16:30.612 --> 03:16:33.882 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOURTEEN ESTABLISH A

03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:34.416 region:rollup2
RAINY DAY FUND.

03:16:33.882 --> 03:16:35.083 region:rollup2
WITH.

03:16:34.416 --> 03:16:37.252 region:rollup2
WITH.

03:16:35.083 --> 03:16:39.721 region:rollup2
WITH A TARGET OF TEN PERCENT OF

03:16:37.252 --> 03:16:41.657 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND TAXES.

03:16:39.721 --> 03:16:43.058 region:rollup2
AND THE THE POINT OF THE RAINY

03:16:41.657 --> 03:16:45.027 region:rollup2
DAY FUND WAS TO.

03:16:43.058 --> 03:16:46.361 region:rollup2
ON THE ONE HAND KEEP SPENDING

03:16:45.027 --> 03:16:47.896 region:rollup2
LOWER BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING SOME

03:16:46.361 --> 03:16:48.430 region:rollup2
OF WHAT COULD OTHERWISE BE SENT

03:16:47.896 --> 03:16:49.965 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE PUTTING IN THE

03:16:48.430 --> 03:16:50.532 region:rollup2
RADIATOR FINE BUT ALSO HAVE

03:16:49.965 --> 03:16:52.501 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AVAILABLE SO THAT

03:16:50.532 --> 03:16:54.436 region:rollup2
WHEN.

03:16:52.501 --> 03:16:56.305 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE'S AN ECONOMIC

03:16:54.436 --> 03:16:57.973 region:rollup2
DOWNTURN IN THE STATE BUDGET IS

03:16:56.305 --> 03:16:59.741 region:rollup2
FACING BUDGET PROBLEMS YOU CAN

03:16:57.973 --> 03:17:02.010 region:rollup2
DRAW ON THAT RAINY DAY FUND TO

03:16:59.741 --> 03:17:05.080 region:rollup2
TO AVOID SPENDING CUTS AND TAX

03:17:02.010 --> 03:17:05.981 region:rollup2
INCREASES AND OTHER ACTIONS.

03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:08.417 region:rollup2
NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF.

03:17:05.981 --> 03:17:09.351 region:rollup2
OF OTHER HEALTH CARE.

03:17:08.417 --> 03:17:12.154 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION.

03:17:09.351 --> 03:17:14.356 region:rollup2
.

03:17:12.154 --> 03:17:16.024 region:rollup2
YOU. THE THE VARIOUS OPTIONS

03:17:14.356 --> 03:17:17.359 region:rollup2
THAT WE MENTION HERE WOULD WOULD

03:17:16.024 --> 03:17:19.094 region:rollup2
VARY CONSIDERABLY IN TERMS OF

03:17:17.359 --> 03:17:20.929 region:rollup2
REVENUE VOLATILITY FOR EXAMPLE.

03:17:19.094 --> 03:17:23.765 region:rollup2
.

03:17:20.929 --> 03:17:25.033 region:rollup2
A A PERSONAL INCOME TAX US ROUTE

03:17:23.765 --> 03:17:27.602 region:rollup2
BY RATE INCREASE THAT'S FOLKS

03:17:25.033 --> 03:17:28.737 region:rollup2
AND HIGH INCOME TAXPAYERS WOULD

03:17:27.602 --> 03:17:30.605 region:rollup2
BE VERY VOLATILE.

03:17:28.737 --> 03:17:32.507 region:rollup2
AND AND GENERALLY SPEAKING.

03:17:30.605 --> 03:17:34.476 region:rollup2
ALL THINGS EQUAL WOULD REQUIRE

03:17:32.507 --> 03:17:37.145 region:rollup2
A LARGER BUDGET RESERVE.

03:17:34.476 --> 03:17:38.880 region:rollup2
THAN SAY PROBABLY A PAYROLL TAX

03:17:37.145 --> 03:17:41.049 region:rollup2
WHICH IS LIKE WE DON WAGES AND

03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:45.120 region:rollup2
SALARIES WHICH IS A RELATIVELY.

03:17:41.049 --> 03:17:47.522 region:rollup2
STABLE I INCOME SOURCE.

03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:49.491 region:rollup2
SO SO THOSE THOSE TWO.

03:17:47.522 --> 03:17:51.293 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS REALLY SHOULD BE

03:17:49.491 --> 03:17:53.428 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF TOGETHER TO THE TO IN

03:17:51.293 --> 03:17:55.230 region:rollup2
GENERAL TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

03:17:53.428 --> 03:17:57.132 region:rollup2
THAT A PROPOSAL RELIES ON A MORE

03:17:55.230 --> 03:17:58.433 region:rollup2
VOLATILE REVENUE SOURCE.

03:17:57.132 --> 03:17:59.267 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A GREATER NEED FOR A

03:17:58.433 --> 03:18:01.770 region:rollup2
BUDGET RESERVE AND THERE IS

03:17:59.267 --> 03:18:03.572 region:rollup2
REALLY NO ONE RIGHT NUMBER.

03:18:01.770 --> 03:18:05.474 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT IT TARGET SHOULD BE.

03:18:03.572 --> 03:18:06.208 region:rollup2
AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

03:18:05.474 --> 03:18:08.176 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED.

03:18:06.208 --> 03:18:08.744 region:rollup2
IN THE OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET

03:18:08.176 --> 03:18:10.679 region:rollup2
HEARING IT FROM THE ASSEMBLY

03:18:08.744 --> 03:18:11.813 region:rollup2
BUDGET COMMITTEE.

03:18:10.679 --> 03:18:13.982 region:rollup2
TO SOME EXTENT IT RISE.

03:18:11.813 --> 03:18:15.717 region:rollup2
RELY A LOT DEPENDS ON THE SORT

03:18:13.982 --> 03:18:17.185 region:rollup2
OF RISK TOLERANCE YOU HAVE.

03:18:15.717 --> 03:18:19.755 region:rollup2
BUT ESPECIALLY IN A PROGRAM OF.

03:18:17.185 --> 03:18:20.989 region:rollup2
IT IF THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS

03:18:19.755 --> 03:18:21.223 region:rollup2
MAJOR CHANGES TO THE HEALTHCARE

03:18:20.989 --> 03:18:23.925 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

03:18:21.223 --> 03:18:25.927 region:rollup2
.

03:18:23.925 --> 03:18:27.829 region:rollup2
THIS YOU KNOW STABILITY AND

03:18:25.927 --> 03:18:29.498 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SERVICES BOB IS

03:18:27.829 --> 03:18:30.565 region:rollup2
DESIRABLE AND SO LARGER BUDGET

03:18:29.498 --> 03:18:33.301 region:rollup2
RESERVE WILL HAVE THE

03:18:30.565 --> 03:18:34.336 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE REALIZE THAT.

03:18:33.301 --> 03:18:36.905 region:rollup2
SO THAT CONCLUDES.

03:18:34.336 --> 03:18:38.740 region:rollup2
MY REMARKS AND.

03:18:36.905 --> 03:18:41.643 region:rollup2
WHERE MY HABIT ANSWER QUESTIONS

03:18:38.740 --> 03:18:44.079 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE THEM?

03:18:41.643 --> 03:18:44.713 region:rollup2
THREE QUESTIONS MISCHIEF.

03:18:44.079 --> 03:18:47.249 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S CHAIR IT BRIGITTE.

03:18:44.713 --> 03:18:48.984 region:rollup2
ALL THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY

03:18:47.249 --> 03:18:50.719 region:rollup2
ARMED. THREE CATEGORIES OF

03:18:48.984 --> 03:18:52.954 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AROUND THE IMPACT OF

03:18:50.719 --> 03:18:54.589 region:rollup2
TRUMP TAX PLAN. UP THROUGH THE

03:18:52.954 --> 03:18:56.191 region:rollup2
COST OF SOME THE OPTIONS YOU

03:18:54.589 --> 03:18:56.792 region:rollup2
LAID OUT AND THEN.

03:18:56.191 --> 03:18:58.794 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ESTIMATES YOU PAT

03:18:56.792 --> 03:18:59.661 region:rollup2
AROUND A WATER PUBLICLY FINANCED

03:18:58.794 --> 03:19:01.563 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM MIGHT LOOK

03:18:59.661 --> 03:19:03.131 region:rollup2
LIKE SPEAKING FIRST AROUND THE

03:19:01.563 --> 03:19:04.433 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF THE TRUMP TAX PLAN I.

03:19:03.131 --> 03:19:06.301 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THE VARIOUS TAX

03:19:04.433 --> 03:19:08.637 region:rollup2
OPTIONS THAT YOU HAVE LAID OUT

03:19:06.301 --> 03:19:10.005 region:rollup2
HERE. UP OBVIOUSLY THESE WERE IN

03:19:08.637 --> 03:19:10.572 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION I THINK LAST YEAR

03:19:10.005 --> 03:19:13.208 region:rollup2
WHEN.

03:19:10.572 --> 03:19:15.076 region:rollup2
THIS WAS AND AND DISCUSSION IN

03:19:13.208 --> 03:19:16.344 region:rollup2
THE SENATE. OF BUT SINCE THEN

03:19:15.076 --> 03:19:18.046 region:rollup2
WE'VE OBVIOUSLY HAD A VERY

03:19:16.344 --> 03:19:19.815 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

03:19:18.046 --> 03:19:21.016 region:rollup2
FEDERAL.

03:19:19.815 --> 03:19:22.150 region:rollup2
SAID OF CHANGES OF OUR TAX

03:19:21.016 --> 03:19:24.553 region:rollup2
POLICY AND.

03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:26.388 region:rollup2
YOU ALLUDED TO SOMEONE ELSE'S

03:19:24.553 --> 03:19:27.789 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE STARTING ARE ON WHAT

03:19:26.388 --> 03:19:28.924 region:rollup2
IT WOULD TAKE TO BRING BACK SOME

03:19:27.789 --> 03:19:30.091 region:rollup2
OF THE REVENUES BUT GIVEN THE

03:19:28.924 --> 03:19:30.625 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CUTS AT THE FEDERAL

03:19:30.091 --> 03:19:32.928 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF CERTAIN.

03:19:30.625 --> 03:19:34.496 region:rollup2
TAXES.

03:19:32.928 --> 03:19:36.798 region:rollup2
IS THE LA O. ARE YOU GUYS

03:19:34.496 --> 03:19:38.266 region:rollup2
ANALYZING WHAT IT MIGHT TAKE TO

03:19:36.798 --> 03:19:39.935 region:rollup2
US FOR US TO REVERSE SOME OF

03:19:38.266 --> 03:19:41.703 region:rollup2
THAT TO BRING IN STATE REVENUES.

03:19:39.935 --> 03:19:42.304 region:rollup2
ARE IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE TAX

03:19:41.703 --> 03:19:44.072 region:rollup2
REVENUE NEUTRAL OR TAX MUTUAL

03:19:42.304 --> 03:19:45.874 region:rollup2
TO.

03:19:44.072 --> 03:19:47.142 region:rollup2
AT SOME OF THE CORPORATIONS OR

03:19:45.874 --> 03:19:49.277 region:rollup2
THE WEALTHY YOUR.

03:19:47.142 --> 03:19:51.079 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE JUST

03:19:49.277 --> 03:19:53.815 region:rollup2
SEEN SIGNIFICANT TAX CUTS AND

03:19:51.079 --> 03:19:55.917 region:rollup2
WHAT DO THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE.

03:19:53.815 --> 03:19:57.719 region:rollup2
ENSURE WE HAVE NOT PRODUCED ANY

03:19:55.917 --> 03:19:59.221 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS LIKE THAT.

03:19:57.719 --> 03:20:00.355 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED THE FRANCHISE TAX

03:19:59.221 --> 03:20:01.456 region:rollup2
BOARD IS CURRENTLY WORKING

03:20:00.355 --> 03:20:03.225 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

03:20:01.456 --> 03:20:04.993 region:rollup2
THE MANY PROVISIONS OF THE

03:20:03.225 --> 03:20:06.261 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TAX BILL ON AND SOME OF

03:20:04.993 --> 03:20:08.897 region:rollup2
THEM ESPECIALLY ON THE BUSINESS

03:20:06.261 --> 03:20:10.932 region:rollup2
TAX SIDE ARE QUITE COMPLICATED.

03:20:08.897 --> 03:20:12.033 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A NEW LOVE

03:20:10.932 --> 03:20:14.336 region:rollup2
A DEDUCTION OF.

03:20:12.033 --> 03:20:16.004 region:rollup2
PASSED THROUGH INCOME FROM

03:20:14.336 --> 03:20:16.938 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES TO INDIVIDUALS AND.

03:20:16.004 --> 03:20:18.773 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

03:20:16.938 --> 03:20:19.407 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW IN TERMS

03:20:18.773 --> 03:20:20.108 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN FOR

03:20:19.407 --> 03:20:21.042 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

03:20:20.108 --> 03:20:23.979 region:rollup2
.

03:20:21.042 --> 03:20:26.915 region:rollup2
SO.

03:20:23.979 --> 03:20:28.283 region:rollup2
IT WE COULD OR IS HE LEN GONNA

03:20:26.915 --> 03:20:29.985 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THIS HEARD IS THIS

03:20:28.283 --> 03:20:30.552 region:rollup2
REALLY ENHANCE OF FOR THE

03:20:29.985 --> 03:20:31.286 region:rollup2
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AT THIS

03:20:30.552 --> 03:20:32.921 region:rollup2
POINT.

03:20:31.286 --> 03:20:33.989 region:rollup2
WELL I I BELIEVE FTP IS PLANNING

03:20:32.921 --> 03:20:35.523 region:rollup2
TO PRESENTER A PORTS OF THE

03:20:33.989 --> 03:20:37.092 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN APRIL ABOUT

03:20:35.523 --> 03:20:39.094 region:rollup2
CONFORMITY ISSUES.

03:20:37.092 --> 03:20:42.130 region:rollup2
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS.

03:20:39.094 --> 03:20:44.065 region:rollup2
NOTED THAT IT PLANS TO TRY TO

03:20:42.130 --> 03:20:45.934 region:rollup2
REFLECT THE REVENUE IMPACTS IN

03:20:44.065 --> 03:20:48.003 region:rollup2
ITS MAY REVISION.

03:20:45.934 --> 03:20:49.638 region:rollup2
WE'LL OF COURSE SPEECH TRYING

03:20:48.003 --> 03:20:51.940 region:rollup2
TO ESTIMATE THOSE AFFECTS AS

03:20:49.638 --> 03:20:53.575 region:rollup2
PART OF OUR FUTURE WILL FUTURE I

03:20:51.940 --> 03:20:55.977 region:rollup2
REVENUE ESTIMATING EFFORTS.

03:20:53.575 --> 03:20:59.014 region:rollup2
BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE

03:20:55.977 --> 03:21:00.448 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR BEFORE. WE

03:20:59.014 --> 03:21:02.050 region:rollup2
START TO GET ANY DATA ON THE ONE

03:21:00.448 --> 03:21:03.985 region:rollup2
HAND.

03:21:02.050 --> 03:21:05.487 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW MUCH I INCOME HAS BEEN

03:21:03.985 --> 03:21:06.788 region:rollup2
SHIFTED FROM YEAR TO YEAR

03:21:05.487 --> 03:21:08.757 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE

03:21:06.788 --> 03:21:10.725 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES THAT TAXPAYERS SPACE.

03:21:08.757 --> 03:21:12.494 region:rollup2
BUT MOREOVER IT'S UNDERSTAND

03:21:10.725 --> 03:21:13.628 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE ONGOING AFFECTS

03:21:12.494 --> 03:21:15.196 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE A FEW

03:21:13.628 --> 03:21:16.932 region:rollup2
YEARS TO GET ENOUGH DATA TO HAVE

03:21:15.196 --> 03:21:18.700 region:rollup2
A GOOD SENSE OF THAT.

03:21:16.932 --> 03:21:20.368 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS IN SHORT IT WOULD BE

03:21:18.700 --> 03:21:21.636 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE.

03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:22.737 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE A FAX.

03:21:21.636 --> 03:21:24.806 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO.

03:21:22.737 --> 03:21:25.774 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT.

03:21:24.806 --> 03:21:26.975 region:rollup2
WHAT SORT OF?

03:21:25.774 --> 03:21:28.610 region:rollup2
OFFSETTING MEASURES THE STATE

03:21:26.975 --> 03:21:29.444 region:rollup2
COULD TAKE.

03:21:28.610 --> 03:21:30.779 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD JUST SAY THIS IS FOR

03:21:29.444 --> 03:21:31.947 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES I'M CERTAINLY

03:21:30.779 --> 03:21:34.316 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN AND TRYING TO

03:21:31.947 --> 03:21:36.351 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HOW OUR STATE COULD.

03:21:34.316 --> 03:21:37.018 region:rollup2
REVERSE SOME OF WHAT I THINK OF

03:21:36.351 --> 03:21:38.687 region:rollup2
AS THE.

03:21:37.018 --> 03:21:40.088 region:rollup2
NOT NOT PARTICULAR HELPFUL

03:21:38.687 --> 03:21:41.089 region:rollup2
POLICY DECISIONS MADE BY

03:21:40.088 --> 03:21:43.091 region:rollup2
CONGRESS THAT HER GIVING

03:21:41.089 --> 03:21:44.526 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT TAX BREAKS TO

03:21:43.091 --> 03:21:46.328 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS AND AND THE

03:21:44.526 --> 03:21:48.363 region:rollup2
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS.

03:21:46.328 --> 03:21:49.464 region:rollup2
EN AND I'D BE VERY INTERESTED

03:21:48.363 --> 03:21:51.633 region:rollup2
IN THINKING ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF

03:21:49.464 --> 03:21:54.402 region:rollup2
TAX OPTIONS WOULD HELP TO.

03:21:51.633 --> 03:21:56.204 region:rollup2
TO TO ADDRESS THAT WHEN YOU ARE

03:21:54.402 --> 03:21:57.605 region:rollup2
SLASHING CORPORATE TAX RATE OR

03:21:56.204 --> 03:21:59.307 region:rollup2
IMPACTING SALTS OR.

03:21:57.605 --> 03:22:01.209 region:rollup2
OR INCREASING QUALIFIED

03:21:59.307 --> 03:22:02.477 region:rollup2
BUSINESS INCOME OF THESE ALL

03:22:01.209 --> 03:22:03.912 region:rollup2
SEEM TO ME BE THINGS THAT WE

03:22:02.477 --> 03:22:05.447 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AS A WAY

03:22:03.912 --> 03:22:07.782 region:rollup2
TO POTENTIALLY FUND. NEW

03:22:05.447 --> 03:22:08.416 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WE MAY WANT TO

03:22:07.782 --> 03:22:09.884 region:rollup2
CONSIDER PARTICULAR IN THE AREA

03:22:08.416 --> 03:22:11.386 region:rollup2
OF HEALTHCARE.

03:22:09.884 --> 03:22:12.954 region:rollup2
FROM MY SECOND SET OF QUESTIONS

03:22:11.386 --> 03:22:13.788 region:rollup2
I WAS. LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT

03:22:12.954 --> 03:22:17.726 region:rollup2
OPTIONS THAT.

03:22:13.788 --> 03:22:18.793 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE MISTER.

03:22:17.726 --> 03:22:20.095 region:rollup2
THE MISTER JOHNSON YOU WERE

03:22:18.793 --> 03:22:23.231 region:rollup2
PRESENTED AROUND.

03:22:20.095 --> 03:22:26.001 region:rollup2
HOW WE TARGET VARIOUS STE ON

03:22:23.231 --> 03:22:27.335 region:rollup2
UNINSURED POPULATIONS AND I BOTH

03:22:26.001 --> 03:22:30.872 region:rollup2
IN THE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS?

03:22:27.335 --> 03:22:32.640 region:rollup2
CATEGORY AS WELL AS WITH A LOT

03:22:30.872 --> 03:22:34.175 region:rollup2
WITH WITH ON IT OTHER UNDER AND

03:22:32.640 --> 03:22:36.011 region:rollup2
UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS DO ANY

03:22:34.175 --> 03:22:38.079 region:rollup2
COST ESTIMATES ON WHAT THESE

03:22:36.011 --> 03:22:39.681 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OPTIONS WOULD. ENTAIL

03:22:38.079 --> 03:22:42.550 region:rollup2
I'M THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

03:22:39.681 --> 03:22:43.451 region:rollup2
OFFICE IS WORKING ON AND IN

03:22:42.550 --> 03:22:45.320 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE.

03:22:43.451 --> 03:22:47.122 region:rollup2
LET ME GO THROUGH THE

03:22:45.320 --> 03:22:49.491 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL ITEMS THEN TERMS OF

03:22:47.122 --> 03:22:50.658 region:rollup2
THE EXTENDING MEDICAL COVERAGE.

03:22:49.491 --> 03:22:53.028 region:rollup2
FULL SCOPE.

03:22:50.658 --> 03:22:54.929 region:rollup2
TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHO

03:22:53.028 --> 03:22:56.598 region:rollup2
WOULD BE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE BUT

03:22:54.929 --> 03:22:58.133 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR UNDOCUMENTED STATUS WE

03:22:56.598 --> 03:23:00.468 region:rollup2
DO THINK THAT THAT WOULD LIKELY

03:22:58.133 --> 03:23:02.037 region:rollup2
COST IN THE LOW AND THE SEVERAL

03:23:00.468 --> 03:23:03.805 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE

03:23:02.037 --> 03:23:05.240 region:rollup2
STILL WORKING ON REFINING THOSE

03:23:03.805 --> 03:23:08.076 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES BUT THOSE ARE SORT OF

03:23:05.240 --> 03:23:11.813 region:rollup2
OUR PRELIMINARY. GENERAL NUMBERS

03:23:08.076 --> 03:23:13.381 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF PROVIDE EXTENDING

03:23:11.813 --> 03:23:15.884 region:rollup2

IMMIGRANTS THROUGH SUCH A THING

03:23:15.884 --> 03:23:17.752 region:rollup2
AS A.

03:23:16.818 --> 03:23:21.423 region:rollup2
AS.

03:23:17.752 --> 03:23:23.591 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY

03:23:21.423 --> 03:23:26.394 region:rollup2
PERHAPS TO COVERED CALIFORNIA OF

03:23:23.591 --> 03:23:27.896 region:rollup2
THAT WAS POSSIBLE WELL WE HAVE

03:23:26.394 --> 03:23:29.964 region:rollup2
SOME PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES THAT

03:23:27.896 --> 03:23:32.434 region:rollup2
OF THAT AS WELL AND WE THINK

03:23:29.964 --> 03:23:34.402 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE. IN THE LOW

03:23:32.434 --> 03:23:35.236 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

03:23:34.402 --> 03:23:36.805 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE NOT SURE SALES EVER

03:23:35.236 --> 03:23:38.406 region:rollup2
BILLIONS VERSUS LOW BILLIONS SO

03:23:36.805 --> 03:23:39.307 region:rollup2
SEVERAL BILLIONS ON THE MEDI CAL

03:23:38.406 --> 03:23:40.775 region:rollup2
SIGNED FOR THE.

03:23:39.307 --> 03:23:41.476 region:rollup2
FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WHO.

03:23:40.775 --> 03:23:42.143 region:rollup2
WHO ARE REALLY BELOW ONE

03:23:41.476 --> 03:23:43.611 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT

03:23:42.143 --> 03:23:44.813 region:rollup2
OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND

03:23:43.611 --> 03:23:46.281 region:rollup2
THEN FOR IN FRONT DOCUMENTED

03:23:44.813 --> 03:23:46.981 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE OVER ONE

03:23:46.281 --> 03:23:48.450 region:rollup2
THIRTY EIGHT BUT?

03:23:46.981 --> 03:23:50.452 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED.

03:23:48.450 --> 03:23:52.420 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

03:23:50.452 --> 03:23:54.556 region:rollup2
LINE THAT WOULD BE.

03:23:52.420 --> 03:23:55.790 region:rollup2
THAT THE LOW BILLION TAKE AND I

03:23:54.556 --> 03:23:57.992 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR SIZE.

03:23:55.790 --> 03:24:00.462 region:rollup2
IN MY MIND SEVERAL BILLION LOW

03:23:57.992 --> 03:24:01.496 region:rollup2
BILLION SOUNDS AROUND THE SAME.

03:24:00.462 --> 03:24:03.431 region:rollup2
SINCE I WAS ABSOLUTELY HIGHER

03:24:01.496 --> 03:24:04.299 region:rollup2

INSURANCE SUBSIDY SIDE AND THEN

03:24:06.901 --> 03:24:09.370 region:rollup2
HOW ABOUT TARGETING OTHER

REMAINING ON A SHARED THOSE WE

03:24:09.370 --> 03:24:12.507 region:rollup2
ARE LOOKING INTO BUT WE DO NOT

03:24:11.673 --> 03:24:13.808 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY ESTIMATES THAT WE CAN

03:24:12.507 --> 03:24:14.142 region:rollup2
CHAT THE SOCKET WHEN YOU EXPECT

03:24:13.808 --> 03:24:15.977 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT'S.

03:24:14.142 --> 03:24:18.246 region:rollup2
OR WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING

03:24:15.977 --> 03:24:19.114 region:rollup2
ON THEM OVER THE SPRING AND WE

03:24:18.246 --> 03:24:21.182 region:rollup2
HOPE TO BE ABLE TO.

03:24:19.114 --> 03:24:22.884 region:rollup2
PROVIDE LEGISLATURE WITH SOME

03:24:21.182 --> 03:24:25.587 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THOSE.

03:24:22.884 --> 03:24:26.921 region:rollup2
AT THAT AT THAT POINT OKAY AND

03:24:25.587 --> 03:24:28.256 region:rollup2
THEN MY MY LHASA QUESTIONS HAVE

03:24:26.921 --> 03:24:29.657 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS

03:24:28.256 --> 03:24:31.392 region:rollup2
HE MADE AROUND WHAT A PUBLICLY

03:24:29.657 --> 03:24:32.927 region:rollup2
FINANCES TIM WOULD WOULD COST

03:24:31.392 --> 03:24:34.596 region:rollup2
AND. THERE'S BEEN A LOT THAT'S

03:24:32.927 --> 03:24:36.364 region:rollup2
BEEN MADE OF THE FOUR HUNDRED

03:24:34.596 --> 03:24:38.333 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER AND. AS A

03:24:36.364 --> 03:24:39.534 region:rollup2
READ ON PAGE EIGHT YOU ESTIMATE

03:24:38.333 --> 03:24:41.469 region:rollup2
FOR HER BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL

03:24:39.534 --> 03:24:42.470 region:rollup2
COSTS TO RUN A PUBLICLY FINANCED

03:24:41.469 --> 03:24:45.940 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PROGRAM.

03:24:42.470 --> 03:24:46.407 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS

03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:47.709 region:rollup2
THAT AS.

03:24:46.407 --> 03:24:48.943 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW MUCH

03:24:47.709 --> 03:24:50.278 region:rollup2
WE USE HAVE SPENT IN TWO

03:24:48.943 --> 03:24:52.514 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO

03:24:50.278 --> 03:24:54.649 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ARE ON HEALTH

03:24:52.514 --> 03:24:55.917 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES RIGHT SO THAT

03:24:54.649 --> 03:24:57.485 region:rollup2
NUMBER IS NOT COINCIDENTAL IT'S

03:24:55.917 --> 03:24:58.119 region:rollup2
IT'S MEANT TO BE THE SAME.

03:24:57.485 --> 03:24:59.487 region:rollup2
OR DID YOU CALCULATE A

03:24:58.119 --> 03:25:00.655 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WE CALCULATED IT QUITE

03:24:59.487 --> 03:25:03.925 region:rollup2
A BIT DIFFERENTLY.

03:25:00.655 --> 03:25:05.393 region:rollup2
SO WE WE. WE CHECKED OUR NUMBER

03:25:03.925 --> 03:25:07.095 region:rollup2
AGAINST EXISTING HEALTH CARE

03:25:05.393 --> 03:25:09.063 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES TO SEE IF IT WAS IN

03:25:07.095 --> 03:25:10.999 region:rollup2
THE BALLPARK OR SOMETHING AROUND

03:25:09.063 --> 03:25:13.034 region:rollup2
WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WOULD BE.

03:25:10.999 --> 03:25:14.235 region:rollup2
HOWEVER OUR APPROACH WAS REALLY

03:25:13.034 --> 03:25:17.071 region:rollup2
TO.

03:25:14.235 --> 03:25:18.940 region:rollup2
LOOK AT HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES

03:25:17.071 --> 03:25:20.441 region:rollup2
FROM THE MOST SORT OF ANALOGOUS

03:25:18.940 --> 03:25:21.376 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT WE COULD THINK OF

03:25:20.441 --> 03:25:23.344 region:rollup2
TO.

03:25:21.376 --> 03:25:25.547 region:rollup2
THE ONE THAT WE'RE ANALYZING IN

03:25:23.344 --> 03:25:27.882 region:rollup2
THIS WAS AND SO WE USED MEDI CAL

03:25:25.547 --> 03:25:30.885 region:rollup2
AS A SORT OF BASE LEVEL.

03:25:27.882 --> 03:25:31.719 region:rollup2
BASE LEVEL POGRAM BY WHICH WE

03:25:30.885 --> 03:25:33.621 region:rollup2
COULD.

03:25:31.719 --> 03:25:35.657 region:rollup2
TEND TO SEE WHAT WHAT WOULD

03:25:33.621 --> 03:25:37.292 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IF ADDITIONAL PEOPLE

03:25:35.657 --> 03:25:38.693 region:rollup2
ENROLLED IN MEDICAID OUT AND THE

03:25:37.292 --> 03:25:41.429 region:rollup2
SORT OF COVERAGE.

03:25:38.693 --> 03:25:43.031 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE POPULATION TIED

03:25:41.429 --> 03:25:44.899 region:rollup2
THE TYPES OF POPULATIONS THAT

03:25:43.031 --> 03:25:46.835 region:rollup2
WERE ENROLLED CHANGE THE RATES

03:25:44.899 --> 03:25:48.136 region:rollup2
CHANGE FROM THE RATES THAT MEDI

03:25:46.835 --> 03:25:49.537 region:rollup2
CAL PAY TO THE RATES THAT

03:25:48.136 --> 03:25:51.706 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAY.

03:25:49.537 --> 03:25:53.374 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE THEM TO TO CHANGE THE

03:25:51.706 --> 03:25:57.478 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS TO A MORE.

03:25:53.374 --> 03:26:00.048 region:rollup2
BROADER SET OF COVERED BENEFITS.

03:25:57.478 --> 03:26:02.150 region:rollup2
AND SO ON AND SO WE REALLY

03:26:00.048 --> 03:26:05.386 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED IT FROM THE GROUND

03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:08.523 region:rollup2
UP USING SORT OF MEDI CAL PER

03:26:05.386 --> 03:26:10.258 region:rollup2
CAPITA EXPENDITURES THAT COMES

03:26:08.523 --> 03:26:13.528 region:rollup2
WITH ITS OWN CAVEATS WHICH I'M

03:26:10.258 --> 03:26:15.897 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO GO INTO.

03:26:13.528 --> 03:26:17.599 region:rollup2
AND THEN BUILT THAT ESTIMATE

03:26:15.897 --> 03:26:19.534 region:rollup2
FROM THE GROUND UP BILL TO

03:26:17.599 --> 03:26:21.236 region:rollup2
SEPARATE ESTIMATE IN TERMS OF

03:26:19.534 --> 03:26:25.073 region:rollup2
WATER THE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:26:21.236 --> 03:26:28.142 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES OF OF MEDI CAL AS

03:26:25.073 --> 03:26:28.576 region:rollup2
WELL AS OTHER SO AS MEDICARE AND

03:26:28.142 --> 03:26:30.278 region:rollup2
OTHER SORT OF STATE

03:26:28.576 --> 03:26:34.849 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED.

03:26:30.278 --> 03:26:38.653 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND SO.

03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:41.489 region:rollup2
BY AND LARGE WE JUST ABOUT A

03:26:38.653 --> 03:26:44.759 region:rollup2
WEEK CAME AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT

03:26:41.489 --> 03:26:47.795 region:rollup2
DIRECTION BUT SETTLED ON A

03:26:44.759 --> 03:26:51.099 region:rollup2
SIMILAR NUMBER TWO EXISTING

03:26:47.795 --> 03:26:56.404 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES IN THE

03:26:51.099 --> 03:26:56.971 region:rollup2
STATE. OKAY WELL THAT ON IT DO

03:26:56.404 --> 03:27:05.046 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE MORE DATA ON AND IF

03:26:56.971 --> 03:27:07.348 region:rollup2
THERE IS A WAY TO TAKE

03:27:05.046 --> 03:27:08.783 region:rollup2
THAT FOUR HUNDRED BILLION AND

03:27:07.348 --> 03:27:09.384 region:rollup2
SET UP A PUBLICLY FINANCED

03:27:08.783 --> 03:27:10.918 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A

03:27:09.384 --> 03:27:11.653 region:rollup2
LOT OF.

03:27:10.918 --> 03:27:13.321 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WITH THAT BUT IF

03:27:11.653 --> 03:27:14.889 region:rollup2
THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT IT WOULD

03:27:13.321 --> 03:27:15.490 region:rollup2
NOT COST US ANY MORE THAN WHAT

03:27:14.889 --> 03:27:17.992 region:rollup2
WORK CURRENTLY SPENDING TODAY

03:27:15.490 --> 03:27:19.394 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

03:27:17.992 --> 03:27:20.461 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT A TO THE THAT ADDED

03:27:19.394 --> 03:27:22.030 region:rollup2
REVENUE THAT IS NEEDED.

03:27:20.461 --> 03:27:23.398 region:rollup2
IS NOT ON TOP OF THE ADDITIONAL

03:27:22.030 --> 03:27:25.733 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN THE

03:27:23.398 --> 03:27:25.900 region:rollup2
ECONOMY SO LARGELY WHAT IT WOULD

03:27:25.733 --> 03:27:27.101 region:rollup2
BE.

03:27:25.900 --> 03:27:28.536 region:rollup2
ENACTING SUCH A PUBLICLY

03:27:27.101 --> 03:27:30.805 region:rollup2
FINANCED PROGRAM WOULD INVOLVED

03:27:28.536 --> 03:27:33.174 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRING EXISTING PRIVATE

03:27:30.805 --> 03:27:35.043 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SPENDING AYE INTO OF

03:27:33.174 --> 03:27:38.546 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY FINANCED.

03:27:35.043 --> 03:27:39.814 region:rollup2
STATE RUN SYSTEM CONSUMMATE

03:27:38.546 --> 03:27:40.415 region:rollup2
SURE HAVE THEIR CLEAR AND THEN.

03:27:39.814 --> 03:27:41.049 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING I WAS CURIOUS

03:27:40.415 --> 03:27:42.984 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE NUMBERS

03:27:41.049 --> 03:27:44.419 region:rollup2
WERE THE SAME.

03:27:42.984 --> 03:27:44.752 region:rollup2
AGAIN MAYBE COINCIDENTLY THE.

03:27:44.419 --> 03:27:45.486 region:rollup2
IS.

03:27:44.752 --> 03:27:46.888 region:rollup2
THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE ANY

03:27:45.486 --> 03:27:48.890 region:rollup2
SAVINGS

03:27:46.888 --> 03:27:50.792 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT ONE WOULD THINK WOULD

03:27:48.890 --> 03:27:52.060 region:rollup2
BE THE. THEY STREAMLINED

03:27:50.792 --> 03:27:54.028 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE.

03:27:52.060 --> 03:27:55.296 region:rollup2
OF NATURE OF A PUBLICLY FINANCE

03:27:54.028 --> 03:27:56.464 region:rollup2
SYSTEM RATHER THAN HAVING

03:27:55.296 --> 03:27:57.632 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE.

03:27:56.464 --> 03:27:59.400 region:rollup2
PAYERS.

03:27:57.632 --> 03:28:00.535 region:rollup2
AND AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:02.270 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM OR THE

03:28:00.535 --> 03:28:04.005 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY

03:28:02.270 --> 03:28:07.008 region:rollup2
IT WOULD JUST BE ONE PAIR. OF

03:28:04.005 --> 03:28:09.477 region:rollup2
BUT THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE ANY

03:28:07.008 --> 03:28:13.147 region:rollup2
SAVINGS FROM THAT DID YOU ASSUME

03:28:09.477 --> 03:28:13.881 region:rollup2
THAT IN YOUR MOM ó WE ASSUMED.

03:28:13.147 --> 03:28:16.250 region:rollup2
WE ASSUMED.

03:28:13.881 --> 03:28:17.919 region:rollup2
OR WE CREATED SEPARATE SORT OF

03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:20.421 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:28:17.919 --> 03:28:21.489 region:rollup2
COSTS OF SUCH A PROGRAM AND I I

03:28:20.421 --> 03:28:23.558 region:rollup2
THINK THIS WOULD BE.

03:28:21.489 --> 03:28:26.394 region:rollup2
THAT ESTIMATE WOULD BE LESS

03:28:23.558 --> 03:28:29.897 region:rollup2
THAN IN THE EXISTING MULTI PAYER

03:28:26.394 --> 03:28:30.264 region:rollup2
SYSTEM UP FOR EXAMPLE TO THE

03:28:29.897 --> 03:28:33.401 region:rollup2
TUNE.

03:28:30.264 --> 03:28:34.635 region:rollup2
WHAT BECAUSE WE OFTEN HEAR THAT

03:28:33.401 --> 03:28:35.536 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS?

03:28:34.635 --> 03:28:37.238 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE SYSTEM OR TWENTY TO

03:28:35.536 --> 03:28:39.707 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT BUT.

03:28:37.238 --> 03:28:41.242 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SEEN THOSE SAVINGS

03:28:39.707 --> 03:28:42.010 region:rollup2
UNRESTORED TO HEAR IT FOR OUR

03:28:41.242 --> 03:28:42.777 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE WE ASSUME TOTAL

03:28:42.010 --> 03:28:44.379 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES

03:28:42.777 --> 03:28:44.912 region:rollup2
WOULD BE LESS THAN TEN PERCENT

03:28:44.379 --> 03:28:46.381 region:rollup2
SO.

03:28:44.912 --> 03:28:47.248 region:rollup2
WE DID I WE WE MODELED SOME

03:28:46.381 --> 03:28:48.549 region:rollup2
SAVINGS ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:28:47.248 --> 03:28:49.050 region:rollup2
SIDE IF YOU INCLUDE THE SAVING

03:28:48.549 --> 03:28:49.917 region:rollup2
SAY THAT.

03:28:49.050 --> 03:28:50.385 region:rollup2
IN THE EXISTING HEALTHCARE

03:28:49.917 --> 03:28:52.053 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY

03:28:50.385 --> 03:28:52.620 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS SAY THE STATE

03:28:52.053 --> 03:28:53.888 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATING.

03:28:52.620 --> 03:28:55.123 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATING ENTITIES SUCH AS

03:28:53.888 --> 03:28:56.457 region:rollup2
AN MEDI CAL AND THE

03:28:55.123 --> 03:28:57.291 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES THAT

03:28:56.457 --> 03:28:59.660 region:rollup2
ARE OCCURRING.

03:28:57.291 --> 03:29:01.529 region:rollup2
IN THAT COMMERCIAL HEALTH

03:28:59.660 --> 03:29:02.697 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PLANS AND SO FORTH.

03:29:01.529 --> 03:29:04.365 region:rollup2
SO IN OTHER WORDS SAY YOU'RE

03:29:02.697 --> 03:29:06.300 region:rollup2
SEEN SOME ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS

03:29:04.365 --> 03:29:08.536 region:rollup2
DUE TO THE STREAMLINING BUT

03:29:06.300 --> 03:29:09.937 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT IN A PUBLIC

03:29:08.536 --> 03:29:12.440 region:rollup2
FINANCE SYSTEM MORE PEOPLE WOULD

03:29:09.937 --> 03:29:13.674 region:rollup2
BE COVERED. IS THAT HOW IT ALL

03:29:12.440 --> 03:29:15.276 region:rollup2
BALANCES OUT MOVIE GET MORE

03:29:13.674 --> 03:29:15.943 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE WOULD BE

03:29:15.276 --> 03:29:17.979 region:rollup2
COVERED THERE BE A MORE

03:29:15.943 --> 03:29:19.680 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF BENEFITS.

03:29:17.979 --> 03:29:21.716 region:rollup2
THAT ARE COVERED THROUGH THE

03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:23.484 region:rollup2
INSURANCE SYSTEM AND THEN I I AN

03:29:21.716 --> 03:29:25.686 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL.

03:29:23.484 --> 03:29:27.955 region:rollup2
AND THEN AND AND THAT LACK OF

03:29:25.686 --> 03:29:29.590 region:rollup2
SAY ANY COST SHARING AS IS IN

03:29:27.955 --> 03:29:30.825 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:32.827 region:rollup2
RIGHT AYE IT'S A SORT OF

03:29:30.825 --> 03:29:34.061 region:rollup2
TRANSFER FROM. THE COPAYS AND

03:29:32.827 --> 03:29:35.630 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBLES THAT WE PAY AS

03:29:34.061 --> 03:29:37.231 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UTILIZING

03:29:35.630 --> 03:29:39.133 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM AN INSTEAD WE WOULD

03:29:37.231 --> 03:29:41.402 region:rollup2
NEED THAT FUNDING TO BE IN THE

03:29:39.133 --> 03:29:41.769 region:rollup2
FORM OF TAX REVENUES WHICH HELPS

03:29:41.402 --> 03:29:44.806 region:rollup2
TO.

03:29:41.769 --> 03:29:47.041 region:rollup2
AYE WHICH INCREASES THE AMOUNT

03:29:44.806 --> 03:29:49.577 region:rollup2
OF REVENUES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED

03:29:47.041 --> 03:29:51.279 region:rollup2
TO FUND THE PROGRAM.

03:29:49.577 --> 03:29:52.880 region:rollup2
OKAY SOME I LOVE TO SEE THE

03:29:51.279 --> 03:29:55.983 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS.

03:29:52.880 --> 03:29:56.584 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU USED TO GET TO THAT

03:29:55.983 --> 03:29:57.051 region:rollup2
FORMER BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER

03:29:56.584 --> 03:29:58.419 region:rollup2
IT'S IT IS AMAZINGLY

03:29:57.051 --> 03:30:01.055 region:rollup2
COINCIDENTAL THAT IT IS SO

03:29:58.419 --> 03:30:01.789 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT WE SPEND TODAY SO?

03:30:01.055 --> 03:30:02.857 region:rollup2
ON PAT AND I KNOW YOU'RE

03:30:01.789 --> 03:30:04.525 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SENATE WAS COMPLETELY

03:30:02.857 --> 03:30:05.860 region:rollup2
COINCIDENTAL BUT.

03:30:04.525 --> 03:30:07.028 region:rollup2
JUST LOVE LOVE TO SEE THAT AND

03:30:05.860 --> 03:30:08.329 region:rollup2
THEN A FINAL QUESTION I KNOW

03:30:07.028 --> 03:30:10.631 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF.

03:30:08.329 --> 03:30:12.100 region:rollup2
BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE

03:30:10.631 --> 03:30:12.700 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS OF WATER BUT. A

03:30:12.100 --> 03:30:14.602 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTHCARE

03:30:12.700 --> 03:30:16.404 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WOULD WOULD COST AND THE

03:30:14.602 --> 03:30:18.439 region:rollup2
SO CALLED POLLEN STUDY THAT WAS

03:30:16.404 --> 03:30:19.841 region:rollup2
OUT THERE THAT SUGGESTS THAT.

03:30:18.439 --> 03:30:20.475 region:rollup2
THESE NUMBERS ARE ARE TENS OF

03:30:19.841 --> 03:30:21.709 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LAST YEAR

03:30:20.475 --> 03:30:22.977 region:rollup2
ANY COMMENT ON. THAT PARTICULAR

03:30:21.709 --> 03:30:24.912 region:rollup2
STUDY AND.

03:30:22.977 --> 03:30:25.480 region:rollup2
ANY ANALYSIS OF HOW YOUR

03:30:24.912 --> 03:30:27.014 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS DIFFER FROM THAT

03:30:25.480 --> 03:30:28.416 region:rollup2
STUDY.

03:30:27.014 --> 03:30:29.884 region:rollup2
YEAH AND AND JUST IN THAT WE WE

03:30:28.416 --> 03:30:31.285 region:rollup2
WE DID WORK WITH THAT DOCTOR

03:30:29.884 --> 03:30:32.820 region:rollup2
POLLAND A LITTLE BIT AND AND

03:30:31.285 --> 03:30:34.689 region:rollup2
COMING UP WITH OUR ESTIMATE AND

03:30:32.820 --> 03:30:36.524 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE MANY OF THE

03:30:34.689 --> 03:30:38.126 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE ARE USING IN

03:30:36.524 --> 03:30:39.527 region:rollup2
OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT DOES. THIS

03:30:38.126 --> 03:30:41.963 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTH CARE

03:30:39.527 --> 03:30:43.431 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WOULD COST AND THERE

03:30:41.963 --> 03:30:44.832 region:rollup2
WERE A COUPLE SORT OF THINGS AND

03:30:43.431 --> 03:30:47.401 region:rollup2
LATER WELL AREAS WHERE WE DIDN'T

03:30:44.832 --> 03:30:48.102 region:rollup2
AGREE. ON THE SAY ON THE COST

03:30:47.401 --> 03:30:50.705 region:rollup2
SIDE THE.

03:30:48.102 --> 03:30:52.974 region:rollup2
PERRY ANALYSIS TO THE POLLEN

03:30:50.705 --> 03:30:55.009 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS ASSUMED A SET OF

03:30:52.974 --> 03:30:57.478 region:rollup2
SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF.

03:30:55.009 --> 03:31:00.414 region:rollup2
DECREASED UTILIZATION OF SAY

03:30:57.478 --> 03:31:03.384 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY MA MEDICAL SERVICES

03:31:00.414 --> 03:31:06.888 region:rollup2
OF REDUCED FRAUD AND SO FORTH

03:31:03.384 --> 03:31:11.192 region:rollup2
THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY.

03:31:06.888 --> 03:31:12.994 region:rollup2
SEE AS BEING AS BEING A SORT OF

03:31:11.192 --> 03:31:14.495 region:rollup2
NECESSARY OUTCOME FROM THE

03:31:12.994 --> 03:31:16.130 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT WE WERE

03:31:14.495 --> 03:31:18.533 region:rollup2
ANALYZING SO THERE WAS A

03:31:16.130 --> 03:31:21.102 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND AND

03:31:18.533 --> 03:31:23.738 region:rollup2
THE POLLEN ANALYSIS THERE IS

03:31:21.102 --> 03:31:26.374 region:rollup2
ALSO A DIFFERENCE ON.

03:31:23.738 --> 03:31:29.176 region:rollup2
THE REVENUES AVAILABLE SIDE.

03:31:26.374 --> 03:31:33.548 region:rollup2
WHEREAS THE POLLEN ANALYSIS

03:31:29.176 --> 03:31:38.152 region:rollup2
ASSUMES THAT THE STATE COULD USE

03:31:33.548 --> 03:31:40.521 region:rollup2
OF THE AS THE TAX BENEFIT DUE TO

03:31:38.152 --> 03:31:43.958 region:rollup2
THE EXCLUSION OF EMPLOYER

03:31:40.521 --> 03:31:46.727 region:rollup2
SPONSORED INSURANCE TO FUND THE

03:31:43.958 --> 03:31:49.230 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY AWAY

03:31:46.727 --> 03:31:52.333 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE COULD ACTUALLY.

03:31:49.230 --> 03:31:55.937 region:rollup2
OBTAIN THAT FUNDING AND USE IT

03:31:52.333 --> 03:31:57.505 region:rollup2
TO FUND THE PROGRAM AND SO THERE

03:31:55.937 --> 03:32:00.107 region:rollup2
WERE DIFFERENCES BOTH ON THE

03:31:57.505 --> 03:32:03.477 region:rollup2
TOTAL COST SIDE AND ON THE

03:32:00.107 --> 03:32:05.880 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE FUNDING SIDE

03:32:03.477 --> 03:32:09.517 region:rollup2
THAT NETTED OUT TO A DIFFERENCE.

03:32:05.880 --> 03:32:10.084 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL

03:32:09.517 --> 03:32:11.552 region:rollup2
FUNDING WE THOUGHT WOULD BE

03:32:10.084 --> 03:32:13.054 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

03:32:11.552 --> 03:32:13.988 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT

03:32:13.054 --> 03:32:14.589 region:rollup2

FOR THE INFORMATION WELL IF THE

03:32:17.725 --> 03:32:27.268 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DECIDED

03:32:25.1000 --> 03:32:29.470 region:rollup2
TO PUT A MEASURE BEFORE THE

03:32:27.268 --> 03:32:30.671 region:rollup2
VOTERS IT IT COULD GO RELATIVELY

03:32:29.470 --> 03:32:32.139 region:rollup2

03:32:30.671 --> 03:32:33.608 region:rollup2
AWARE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS.

03:32:32.139 --> 03:32:34.208 region:rollup2
CAN SPEED UP THE PROCESS CAN

03:32:33.608 --> 03:32:35.509 region:rollup2
MAKE IT HAPPEN WITHIN A MATTER

03:32:34.208 --> 03:32:37.478 region:rollup2
OF MONTHS.

03:32:35.509 --> 03:32:39.614 region:rollup2
IF IT WERE UP TO.

03:32:37.478 --> 03:32:40.881 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE

03:32:39.614 --> 03:32:42.950 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO PUT A MEASURE ON

03:32:40.881 --> 03:32:44.819 region:rollup2
THE BALLOT. THEN YOU'RE TALKING

03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:47.989 region:rollup2
PROBABLY AT LEAST A YEAR

03:32:44.819 --> 03:32:49.123 region:rollup2
SIGNATURE GATHERING. YOU KNOW

03:32:47.989 --> 03:32:50.691 region:rollup2
GATHERING UP THE MONEY NOT OF IT

03:32:49.123 --> 03:32:52.393 region:rollup2
IS CHEAP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO

03:32:50.691 --> 03:32:53.728 region:rollup2
GATHER SIGNATURES MILLIONS OF

03:32:52.393 --> 03:32:56.197 region:rollup2
DOLLARS POTENTIAL DEFIED A

03:32:53.728 --> 03:33:02.069 region:rollup2
BALLOT. A CAMPAIGN.

03:32:56.197 --> 03:33:03.671 region:rollup2
SO I AT A MINIMUM A YEAR.

03:33:02.069 --> 03:33:05.039 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO SAID IT.

03:33:03.671 --> 03:33:06.440 region:rollup2
YOUR ANNOUNCES THAT IT PRIME

03:33:05.039 --> 03:33:07.274 region:rollup2
MAKES MORE SENSE TO GO TO THE

03:33:06.440 --> 03:33:08.809 region:rollup2
VOTERS RATHER THAN RELY ON THE

03:33:07.274 --> 03:33:11.479 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE SOME OF

03:33:08.809 --> 03:33:13.147 region:rollup2
THESE POTENTIAL CHANGES LIKE.

03:33:11.479 --> 03:33:14.081 region:rollup2
THE UP TO PROP NINETY EIGHT OR

03:33:13.147 --> 03:33:15.950 region:rollup2
THE GANG LIMIT.

03:33:14.081 --> 03:33:17.918 region:rollup2
WITH THAT BIGGER PICTURE.

03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:19.253 region:rollup2
.

03:33:17.918 --> 03:33:20.321 region:rollup2
WITH THE ORIGINAL POLICY GOALS

03:33:19.253 --> 03:33:20.955 region:rollup2
OF THESE INITIATIVE SAY ABOUT

03:33:20.321 --> 03:33:21.422 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE ROLES OF VOTERS

03:33:20.955 --> 03:33:24.458 region:rollup2
VERSUS.

03:33:21.422 --> 03:33:26.027 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

03:33:24.458 --> 03:33:27.028 region:rollup2
SAY THAT CAN CAN YOU REPEAT THE

03:33:26.027 --> 03:33:28.396 region:rollup2
LAST PART OF QUESTION.

03:33:27.028 --> 03:33:29.830 region:rollup2
WHAT TO THE ORIGINAL POLICY

03:33:28.396 --> 03:33:32.433 region:rollup2
GOALS OF THOSE INITIATIVES?

03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:34.168 region:rollup2
SAY ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE ROLES

03:33:32.433 --> 03:33:35.803 region:rollup2
OF FOR VOTERS VERSUS THE AND

03:33:34.168 --> 03:33:38.639 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

03:33:35.803 --> 03:33:39.874 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S HARD IT THAT'S A

03:33:38.639 --> 03:33:41.208 region:rollup2
TOUGH ONE TO ANSWER BECAUSE.

03:33:39.874 --> 03:33:42.376 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA

03:33:41.208 --> 03:33:44.145 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES THE CONSTITUTION

03:33:42.376 --> 03:33:48.149 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY EASY.

03:33:44.145 --> 03:33:49.383 region:rollup2
TO AMEND SO ON THAT. WHEN THE

03:33:48.149 --> 03:33:50.851 region:rollup2
VOTERS AMEND THE CONSTITUTION.

03:33:49.383 --> 03:33:52.019 region:rollup2
THEY MAY THINK THAT THEY'RE

03:33:50.851 --> 03:33:53.320 region:rollup2
VOTING FOR ON AN ISSUE FOR THE

03:33:52.019 --> 03:33:55.623 region:rollup2
VERY LAST TIME.

03:33:53.320 --> 03:33:58.225 region:rollup2
BUT OUR PROCESS BY DEFINITION.

03:33:55.623 --> 03:33:59.760 region:rollup2
IS OPEN TO CHANGE AND YOU KNOW

03:33:58.225 --> 03:34:01.562 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE PERHAPS

03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:02.963 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD NOT BE LIVING WITH THE

03:34:01.562 --> 03:34:06.233 region:rollup2
STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT

03:34:02.963 --> 03:34:10.271 region:rollup2
THAT'S BASED ON. YOU KNOW.

03:34:06.233 --> 03:34:12.340 region:rollup2
SPENDING WHEN I WAS BACK IN THAT

03:34:10.271 --> 03:34:13.841 region:rollup2
JUNIOR HIGH OR SOMETHING SO YOU

03:34:12.340 --> 03:34:16.010 region:rollup2
KNOW WE'RE GOING FORTY YEARS

03:34:13.841 --> 03:34:17.578 region:rollup2
BACK IN TIME OR SELL DO WE

03:34:16.010 --> 03:34:19.346 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT TO TIE OURSELVES UP

03:34:17.578 --> 03:34:20.581 region:rollup2
IN KNOTS SO.

03:34:19.346 --> 03:34:22.883 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A

03:34:20.581 --> 03:34:25.586 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION THAT EITHER THE

03:34:22.883 --> 03:34:30.124 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE OR THE VOTERS

03:34:25.586 --> 03:34:32.693 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES. CAN GO BACK TO THE

03:34:30.124 --> 03:34:35.529 region:rollup2
BALLOT AND RE VISIT DECISIONS

03:34:32.693 --> 03:34:36.063 region:rollup2
THAT WERE MADE IN PRIOR YEARS

03:34:35.529 --> 03:34:37.732 region:rollup2
NONE OF THIS IS WRITTEN IN

03:34:36.063 --> 03:34:40.134 region:rollup2
STONE.

03:34:37.732 --> 03:34:42.203 region:rollup2
IT SIMPLY REQUIRES FIFTY

03:34:40.134 --> 03:34:45.740 region:rollup2
PERCENT PLUS ONE TO AMEND OUR

03:34:42.203 --> 03:34:49.477 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION OUT WHICH IS WHY IT

03:34:45.740 --> 03:34:51.579 region:rollup2
HAPPEN SO FREQUENTLY.

03:34:49.477 --> 03:34:53.047 region:rollup2
IS IT BECAUSE THAT HELP FORGET

03:34:51.579 --> 03:34:57.151 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S OKAY VERY HOPEFUL

03:34:53.047 --> 03:34:58.953 region:rollup2
SO HONORED FOR OUR FOLKS EMILIO.

03:34:57.151 --> 03:35:00.187 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF OF

03:34:58.953 --> 03:35:01.155 region:rollup2
WHAT CURRENT EMPLOYER PAYMENTS

REALLY RECAPTURE THAT FROM THE

03:35:37.992 --> 03:35:41.629 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I GUESS. WE

IT'S IT POTENTIALLY DEPENDING

03:35:48.569 --> 03:35:51.505 region:rollup2
ON AYE AYE MY COLLEAGUE RYAN

MILLER COULD TOUCH AND MORE IT

03:35:51.505 --> 03:35:53.741 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY COULD BE SORT OF

03:35:52.573 --> 03:35:55.509 region:rollup2
IMPLICIT AND.

03:35:53.741 --> 03:35:57.812 region:rollup2
IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE

03:35:55.509 --> 03:35:59.447 region:rollup2
FUND THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD

03:35:57.812 --> 03:36:00.448 region:rollup2
I'M I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT

CONSIDERATION BECAUSE AS I

03:36:13.093 --> 03:36:15.663 region:rollup2
THERE WOULDN'T BE SORT OF A

03:36:14.562 --> 03:36:17.164 region:rollup2
FEDERAL OFFSET TO THE TAX

03:36:15.663 --> 03:36:18.499 region:rollup2
INCREASE HERE.

03:36:17.164 --> 03:36:18.799 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT.

03:36:18.499 --> 03:36:21.235 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER.

03:36:18.799 --> 03:36:23.070 region:rollup2
PAYROLL TAX PAYMENTS.

03:36:21.235 --> 03:36:25.339 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE DEDUCTIBLE ON

03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:26.640 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL LEVEL HOWEVER AND SO

03:36:25.339 --> 03:36:28.442 region:rollup2
IF IF THE LEGISLATURE PURSUED

03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:30.478 region:rollup2
THAT OPTION.

03:36:28.442 --> 03:36:31.779 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE A SOURCE OF

03:36:30.478 --> 03:36:34.114 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TAX BENEFIT.

03:36:31.779 --> 03:36:36.183 region:rollup2
BUT IN TERMS OF THE STATE BEING

03:36:34.114 --> 03:36:37.818 region:rollup2
ABLE TO COLLECT LIKE REVENUE

03:36:36.183 --> 03:36:39.220 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

03:36:37.818 --> 03:36:40.788 region:rollup2
I AT REDUCED REVENUE FROM THE

03:36:39.220 --> 03:36:41.622 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK

03:36:40.788 --> 03:36:42.189 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS

03:36:41.622 --> 03:36:44.725 region:rollup2
SAYING WHERE WE DON'T REALLY

03:36:42.189 --> 03:36:45.893 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW THAT WOULD.

03:36:44.725 --> 03:36:47.561 region:rollup2
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:36:45.893 --> 03:36:49.396 region:rollup2
COULD DECIDE TO BLOCK GRANTED

03:36:47.561 --> 03:36:51.632 region:rollup2
BUT WE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THAT WAS

03:36:49.396 --> 03:36:52.233 region:rollup2
AN ASSUMPTION THAT WE COULD MAKE

03:36:51.632 --> 03:36:54.468 region:rollup2
IN ESTIMATING THE COST OF THE

03:36:52.233 --> 03:36:55.302 region:rollup2

THE SYSTEM DENY DENY DENY FOR

DOLLARS.

03:38:36.270 --> 03:38:39.640 region:rollup2
A.

03:38:38.372 --> 03:38:41.408 region:rollup2
PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN

03:38:39.640 --> 03:38:43.510 region:rollup2
THE EARNEST UNDERWRITERS STAND

COMMUNITY.

03:38:44.612 --> 03:38:48.449 region:rollup2
.

03:38:46.914 --> 03:38:50.184 region:rollup2
THIS ALSO GOES BACK TO WHAT BILL

03:38:48.449 --> 03:38:51.986 region:rollup2
CLINTON SAID IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

03:38:50.184 --> 03:38:53.654 region:rollup2
WITH HIS GAFFE OF IT'S THE

03:38:51.986 --> 03:38:54.989 region:rollup2
CRAZIEST THING. WE MAKE THE

03:38:53.654 --> 03:38:56.991 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION HERE THAT EVERYONE

03:38:54.989 --> 03:38:58.659 region:rollup2
THAT HAS EMPLOYEE BASED

03:38:56.991 --> 03:39:00.327 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IS DOING JUST FINE CAN

03:38:58.659 --> 03:39:01.629 region:rollup2
WE WE CAN'T TOUCH THAT. IT'S NOT

03:39:00.327 --> 03:39:03.731 region:rollup2
TRUE.

03:39:01.629 --> 03:39:06.200 region:rollup2
IT ALSO GOES TO WHAT ASSEMBLY

03:39:03.731 --> 03:39:07.468 region:rollup2
MEMBER FRIEDMAN SAID.

03:39:06.200 --> 03:39:09.570 region:rollup2
YEAH BACK IN LOS ANGELES.

03:39:07.468 --> 03:39:11.772 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:39:09.570 --> 03:39:14.241 region:rollup2
WHAT IF THE ANTS ARE IS THAT WE

03:39:11.772 --> 03:39:14.742 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAVE TO GET IT THE

03:39:14.241 --> 03:39:16.844 region:rollup2
FIGHT WITH THE FEDERAL

03:39:14.742 --> 03:39:17.945 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT TO GET ANYTHING DONE

03:39:16.844 --> 03:39:23.584 region:rollup2
SHE'S RIGHT SHE'S RIGHT SHE'S

03:39:17.945 --> 03:39:25.285 region:rollup2
RIGHT? THANK YOU.

03:39:23.584 --> 03:39:26.353 region:rollup2
OUR I'M HENRY ABRAMS I'M A

03:39:25.285 --> 03:39:27.655 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN.

03:39:26.353 --> 03:39:29.056 region:rollup2
WITH PHYSICIANS FOR A NATIONAL

03:39:27.655 --> 03:39:32.459 region:rollup2
HEALTH PROGRAM.

03:39:29.056 --> 03:39:33.694 region:rollup2
A COUPLE POINTS AND ONE IS THAT

03:39:32.459 --> 03:39:35.295 region:rollup2
THE WORD COVERAGE HAS BEEN USED

03:39:33.694 --> 03:39:36.930 region:rollup2
A LOT BUT.

03:39:35.295 --> 03:39:38.532 region:rollup2
BY I THINK THAT IT WAS ASSEMBLY

03:39:36.930 --> 03:39:40.501 region:rollup2
MEMBER ARE WALDRON WHOM MADE THE

03:39:38.532 --> 03:39:42.236 region:rollup2
POINT. THAT WE ARE REALLY

03:39:40.501 --> 03:39:44.605 region:rollup2
TALKINGABOUT ACCESS AND I THINK

03:39:42.236 --> 03:39:46.974 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COVERAGE

03:39:44.605 --> 03:39:49.643 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT IN ANY WAY. A CLOSE

03:39:46.974 --> 03:39:52.713 region:rollup2
TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S COVERED

03:39:49.643 --> 03:39:54.581 region:rollup2
RECEIVING. A TIMELY APPROPRIATE

03:39:52.713 --> 03:39:56.583 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY IS COMPREHENSIVE

03:39:54.581 --> 03:39:58.152 region:rollup2
AND AFFORDABLE CARE I THINK ALL

03:39:56.583 --> 03:39:59.720 region:rollup2
OF THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE KEPT

03:39:58.152 --> 03:40:01.855 region:rollup2
IN THE FOREFRONT. AND THEY'RE

03:39:59.720 --> 03:40:03.257 region:rollup2
ALL INTERLINKED AND THAT'S WHY

03:40:01.855 --> 03:40:05.626 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH

03:40:03.257 --> 03:40:07.828 region:rollup2
PROGRAM ARE STRONG ADVOCATES FOR

03:40:05.626 --> 03:40:10.698 region:rollup2
A SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM BECAUSE

03:40:07.828 --> 03:40:13.100 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE POLICY. THAT LINKS

03:40:10.698 --> 03:40:15.636 region:rollup2
THOSE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS WITHOUT

03:40:13.100 --> 03:40:16.737 region:rollup2
WHICH WE DON'T REALLY. PRODUCE

03:40:15.636 --> 03:40:19.306 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL REFORM.

03:40:16.737 --> 03:40:20.374 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING IS THAT I THINK

03:40:19.306 --> 03:40:22.142 region:rollup2
WHEN DOCTOR POLLAND HAS AN

03:40:20.374 --> 03:40:24.078 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON

03:40:22.142 --> 03:40:25.179 region:rollup2
WEDNESDAY. ON MY HOPE THE

03:40:24.078 --> 03:40:27.648 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL KEEP AN

03:40:25.179 --> 03:40:30.250 region:rollup2
OPEN MIND. ABOUT.

03:40:27.648 --> 03:40:33.387 region:rollup2
WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE SOME GAPS

03:40:30.250 --> 03:40:35.923 region:rollup2
IN THE LA JOH ANALYSIS WHEN ONE

03:40:33.387 --> 03:40:37.391 region:rollup2
ELIMINATES PROFIT SEEKING

03:40:35.923 --> 03:40:39.893 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL?

03:40:37.391 --> 03:40:42.963 region:rollup2
INVESTOR OWNED HEALTH INSURANCE

03:40:39.893 --> 03:40:45.966 region:rollup2
AND AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS.

03:40:42.963 --> 03:40:46.700 region:rollup2
AND CAPTURES THE MAXIMUM SAVINGS

03:40:45.966 --> 03:40:48.535 region:rollup2
FROM COORDINATED.

03:40:46.700 --> 03:40:51.138 region:rollup2
.

03:40:48.535 --> 03:40:52.506 region:rollup2
DASH SIMPLIFIED CARE MY I THINK

03:40:51.138 --> 03:40:54.541 region:rollup2
THAT THE COST OF THE PROGRAM

03:40:52.506 --> 03:40:56.477 region:rollup2
WILL COME DOWN A LOT FROM THE

03:40:54.541 --> 03:40:59.880 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS.

03:40:56.477 --> 03:41:01.448 region:rollup2
AND THE THIRD THING IS THAT I

03:40:59.880 --> 03:41:03.650 region:rollup2
HOPE THE COMMITTEE BUT HASN'T

03:41:01.448 --> 03:41:05.619 region:rollup2
GOTTEN LOST IN THE ENORMOUS

03:41:03.650 --> 03:41:06.987 region:rollup2
WEEDS AND DETAILS THAT THEY'VE

03:41:05.619 --> 03:41:10.824 region:rollup2
HEARD.

03:41:06.987 --> 03:41:13.360 region:rollup2
THAT SEEM TO BE OBSTACLES.

03:41:10.824 --> 03:41:15.496 region:rollup2
IN THE FOR GROUND.

03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:17.698 region:rollup2
TO GETTING TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

03:41:15.496 --> 03:41:20.167 region:rollup2
BUT KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE

03:41:17.698 --> 03:41:22.302 region:rollup2
THE PRIZE IS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

03:41:20.167 --> 03:41:24.271 region:rollup2
ONLY A PUBLICLY FINANCED

03:41:22.302 --> 03:41:26.206 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY ADMINISTERED NONPROFIT

03:41:24.271 --> 03:41:28.809 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PROGRAM.

03:41:26.206 --> 03:41:29.710 region:rollup2
I CAN ACHIEVE THAT AND I I

03:41:28.809 --> 03:41:32.079 region:rollup2
REALLY.

03:41:29.710 --> 03:41:35.182 region:rollup2
FEAR THAT THE THE COMMITTEE

03:41:32.079 --> 03:41:36.917 region:rollup2
WILL GET BOGGED DOWN. AND.

03:41:35.182 --> 03:41:38.685 region:rollup2
SHE AS AN OBSTACLE.

03:41:36.917 --> 03:41:40.654 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL

03:41:38.685 --> 03:41:43.090 region:rollup2
BROKEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND SO

03:41:40.654 --> 03:41:45.692 region:rollup2
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT WE HAVE A

03:41:43.090 --> 03:41:48.729 region:rollup2
DYSFUNCTIONAL AND BROKEN LEGAL

03:41:45.692 --> 03:41:49.563 region:rollup2
AND ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM. THAT.

03:41:48.729 --> 03:41:51.131 region:rollup2
PREVENTION US FROM GETTING

03:41:49.563 --> 03:41:52.699 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE MONEY THAT THE

03:41:51.131 --> 03:41:54.601 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CUSTODIAN

03:41:52.699 --> 03:41:58.839 region:rollup2
FOR BUT IT'S OUR MONEY AND

03:41:54.601 --> 03:42:02.009 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO CLAIM IT.

03:41:58.839 --> 03:42:03.277 region:rollup2
THOUGH I'M JEFF CARTAGIA.

03:42:02.009 --> 03:42:04.945 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES. OF.

03:42:03.277 --> 03:42:06.513 region:rollup2
CAR.

03:42:04.945 --> 03:42:08.515 region:rollup2
DOG FIGHT.

03:42:06.513 --> 03:42:12.619 region:rollup2
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS

03:42:08.515 --> 03:42:13.187 region:rollup2
TWO CHAIRMAN WOULD I WILL SAY.

03:42:12.619 --> 03:42:16.023 region:rollup2
ABSTAINING IS NOT A NEUTRAL

03:42:13.187 --> 03:42:18.091 region:rollup2
VOTE.

03:42:16.023 --> 03:42:19.793 region:rollup2
BUT FOR A YEAR YOU GUYS HAVE

03:42:18.091 --> 03:42:22.896 region:rollup2
BEEN PUSHING.

03:42:19.793 --> 03:42:24.765 region:rollup2
AND WHERE IS SINGLE PAYER

03:42:22.896 --> 03:42:26.800 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN AROUND HERE A LONG

03:42:24.765 --> 03:42:28.936 region:rollup2
TIME BEING ASKED OR WHICH.

03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:31.371 region:rollup2

03:42:28.936 --> 03:42:33.640 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH HOW IN

03:42:31.371 --> 03:42:35.642 region:rollup2
THE WORLD KEN'S SINGLE PAYER.

03:42:33.640 --> 03:42:37.244 region:rollup2
WORK.

DOING A GOOD JOB ASSESSING THE

03:43:05.105 --> 03:43:08.642 region:rollup2
THE NEED. FOR A SINGLE PAYER

03:43:07.107 --> 03:43:11.311 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. AND.

03:43:08.642 --> 03:43:13.013 region:rollup2
THE COMPLEXITY OF GETTING THERE.

03:43:11.311 --> 03:43:14.715 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT

03:43:13.013 --> 03:43:16.250 region:rollup2
THIS IS A WAY TO PARK THIS THING

03:43:14.715 --> 03:43:17.484 region:rollup2

A FAIR HEARING BUT OF COURSE

03:43:27.661 --> 03:43:32.399 region:rollup2
THE NEXT STEP IS TO GET OUT OUT

03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:33.433 region:rollup2
THERE AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT.

03:43:32.399 --> 03:43:36.103 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES IS SPENDING OVER

03:43:45.145 --> 03:43:50.117 region:rollup2
IF WE HAD THE FIFTY FIVE

03:43:46.947 --> 03:43:50.117 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLAR PER PERSON

03:43:50.183 --> 03:43:53.687 region:rollup2
WITH A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AND

03:43:52.219 --> 03:43:55.689 region:rollup2
WE SAVED THE FOUR THOUSAND

03:43:53.687 --> 03:43:59.726 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER PERSON.

03:43:55.689 --> 03:44:01.728 region:rollup2
WE WOULD HAVE A SAVED A MILLION

03:43:59.726 --> 03:44:04.531 region:rollup2

03:44:07.868 --> 03:44:10.904 region:rollup2

03:44:09.469 --> 03:44:12.806 region:rollup2
ON DEFENSE.

03:44:10.904 --> 03:44:13.807 region:rollup2
AND WE SPEND MORE THAN THE NEXT

03:44:12.806 --> 03:44:15.475 region:rollup2
SEVEN COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. ON

03:44:13.807 --> 03:44:16.043 region:rollup2
DEFENSE

03:44:15.475 --> 03:44:19.146 region:rollup2

03:44:16.043 --> 03:44:21.348 region:rollup2
YOU.

03:44:19.146 --> 03:44:21.915 region:rollup2

03:44:40.133 --> 03:44:43.870 region:rollup2
NOT HEALTH CARE INSURANCE IS A

03:44:42.169 --> 03:44:46.073 region:rollup2
WAY TO MAKE MONEY.

03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:47.941 region:rollup2
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO MAKE MONEY IF

03:44:46.073 --> 03:44:49.609 region:rollup2
A PERSON CAN'T AFFORD THE RISK

03:44:47.941 --> 03:44:52.346 region:rollup2

03:49:01.928 --> 03:49:06.766 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

03:49:04.664 --> 03:49:09.803 region:rollup2
IT INTO THE RIGHT PLACE.

03:49:06.766 --> 03:49:10.904 region:rollup2
FOR ME AS A BUSINESS PERSON.

03:49:09.803 --> 03:49:12.706 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE HEALTH INSURANCE

03:49:10.904 --> 03:49:14.908 region:rollup2
IS TAX

03:49:12.706 --> 03:49:17.110 region:rollup2
OKAY WE EVER THINK ABOUT THAT

03:49:14.908 --> 03:49:18.578 region:rollup2
ASPECT I KNOW SEMANTICALLY AND

03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:20.714 region:rollup2
IN WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY IT WON'T

03:49:18.578 --> 03:49:22.649 region:rollup2
BE THAT WAY. BUT IN REALITY WHAT

03:49:20.714 --> 03:49:24.451 region:rollup2
COMES OUT OF MY POCKET TO PAY

03:49:22.649 --> 03:49:26.553 region:rollup2
FOR EMPLOYEES IS A TAX.

03:49:24.451 --> 03:49:28.622 region:rollup2
I SAME TIME NOT ONLY GOT TO

03:49:26.553 --> 03:49:30.557 region:rollup2
SPEND THE MONEY BUT I HAVE TO

03:49:28.622 --> 03:49:31.324 region:rollup2
SPEND ALL THE TIME WORRYING

03:49:30.557 --> 03:49:32.759 region:rollup2
ABOUT GETTING IT FOR MY

03:49:31.324 --> 03:49:34.261 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

03:49:32.759 --> 03:49:37.130 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS LIKE WE REALLY NEED A

03:49:34.261 --> 03:49:38.665 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFICATION IN THE SYSTEM AND

03:49:37.130 --> 03:49:40.233 region:rollup2
BY THE WAY I THINK WE ALL SAW

03:49:38.665 --> 03:49:42.168 region:rollup2
THE HEADLINES LAST WEEK ABOUT

03:49:40.233 --> 03:49:44.070 region:rollup2
THE NEW FORMATION OF A COMPANY.

03:49:42.168 --> 03:49:46.306 region:rollup2
A NONPROFIT COMPANY.

03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:47.774 region:rollup2
BY JEFF BEZOS WARREN BUFFETT AND

03:49:46.306 --> 03:49:50.276 region:rollup2
JAMIE DIMON.

03:49:47.774 --> 03:49:52.279 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE FRUSTRATION LEVEL

03:49:50.276 --> 03:49:54.047 region:rollup2
WITH OUR SYSTEM THAT'S BROKEN.

03:49:52.279 --> 03:49:56.349 region:rollup2
I THINK BUSINESS

03:49:54.047 --> 03:49:57.417 region:rollup2
WILL COME AROUND UNDERSTANDING

03:49:56.349 --> 03:49:58.685 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY

03:49:57.417 --> 03:50:00.787 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FOR HEALTH CARE

03:49:58.685 --> 03:50:02.689 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S A PAYROLL TAX WORK

03:50:00.787 --> 03:50:04.024 region:rollup2
OR HEALTH INSURANCE.

03:50:02.689 --> 03:50:05.325 region:rollup2
WE GOT A LOOK AT WHAT'S

03:50:04.024 --> 03:50:06.893 region:rollup2
REASONABLE AND WHAT WAS GONNA

03:50:05.325 --> 03:50:08.261 region:rollup2
REALLY COST.

03:50:06.893 --> 03:50:09.996 region:rollup2
WHO'S GOING TO BENEFIT AND THINK

03:50:08.261 --> 03:50:12.299 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

03:50:09.996 --> 03:50:13.967 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I BELIEVE UNDER SINGLE

03:50:12.299 --> 03:50:15.635 region:rollup2
PAYER SYSTEM WILL BEER CONTAIN

03:50:13.967 --> 03:50:17.303 region:rollup2
COSTS A LOT BETTER THEIR

03:50:15.635 --> 03:50:18.471 region:rollup2
