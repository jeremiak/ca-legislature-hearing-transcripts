HOLD THE- THAT OPEN FOR ADD ONS BOTH OF THOSE. MOTIONS WILL PROCEED NOW TO ISSUE ONE. WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE ENERGY RESOURCES PROGRAMS ACCOUNT OR URBAN. STRUCTURAL DEFICIT RELIEF TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE HAVE OUR PANELISTS TODAY WELCOME- MISTER BOWMAN. FROM THE S. C. E. C. AT- OTHER WILL HAVE- SPEAKER FROM ALEJO AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GOOD MORNING. FORMICA I. TRY THAT RIGHT. WANT TO TAP THE MIKE HE SAID NOT TO TOUCH IT I THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE I MUST ADMIT OKAY. YES I FIXED IT RIGHT REYES DON'T FORGET I HAVE CONTROL. INDEED RELEASE WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THANK YOU CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS DREW BOWEN AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND AS TEACHER POINTED OUT THIS ITEM IS ABOUT OUR PRIMARY FUNDING ACCOUNT THE ENERGY RESOURCES PROGRAM ACCOUNT FOR. URBAN IT'S IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN WE'RE HERE TODAY TO- DESCRIBE THE WAYS IN WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT- THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES HAS BEEN GROWING SO OVER THE LAST DECADE THE LEGISLATURES APPROVED OVER SEVENTY POSITIONS FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN EUROPE ACCOUNT. AND AT THE SAME TIME THE REVENUES THAT THE ACCOUNT IS GENERATING ARE. STEADILY DECLINING. AND THE REASON THEY'RE DECLINING IS WHAT WE LIKE TO CHARACTERIZE AS- US BEING VICTIMS OF OUR OWN SUCCESS THERE ARE TWO PRINCIPAL DRIVERS THE FIRST IS BEHIND THE METER GROWTH. IN SO WE'RE UP TO TWELVE GIGAWATTS NOW OF BEHIND THE METER CHIEFLY SOLAR SOME WIND UP SOME OF THE RESEARCH BUT IT'S BUT CHEAPLY SOURCE OR UP TO TWELVE TWELVE GIGAWATTS- VERY LARGE NUMBER. THE SECOND FACTOR IS CONSERVATION AND SO THE ENERGY COMMISSION ADOPTS I THINK IS MOST OF YOU KNOW A BOTH BUILDING CODE- OUT REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE THAT CERTAIN EFFICIENCY MEASURES BE EMBEDDED IN AND NEWLY BUILT BUILDINGS OR MAJOR ADDITIONS. AND SECOND WE- ADOPT REGULATIONS THAT REGULATE THE MANNER IN WHICH OCT ELECTRONICS AND OTHER ELECTRICITY CONSUMING. PRODUCTS CONSUMER ELECTRICITY AND THE- APPROACHES TO IS TO REDUCE THEM THROUGH THROUGH ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS. THESE TWO FACTORS TOGETHER. HAVE BEEN CONSPIRING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF METERED ELECTRICITY WHICH IS GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA pBUT IT'S BEEN NOT SO GREAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION'S BUDGET. AND SO JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THE- THAT THE TELEVISION- PLANTS REGULATIONS WE ADOPTED SOME YEARS AGO- WE ESTIMATE SAVE EACH CONSUMER ABOUT FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS PER YEAR PER TELEVISION SO THE MODEST INCREASE IN THE COST OF THE TELEVISION BORN. ARE CAUSED BY THE IT THAT THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS GET PAID FOR VERY VERY QUICKLY IN IN A DECADE WHICH IS WHAT WE ESTIMATE THE AVERAGE TV'S LIFE IS THE CONSUMER GETS BACK FIVE FIFTY DOLLARS. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE TO PRETTY PRETTY GOOD ONE THERE'S OTHERS WITH BATTERY CHARGERS WITH COMPUTERS AND SO FORTH BUT AGAIN THESE TWO FACTORS BEHIND THE METER CONSUMPTION THAT DOESN'T GET. THE URBAN CHARGE APPLIED TO IT AND CONSERVATION HAVE DEPRESSED THE OB. ROSS THE REVENUES FOR CALIFORNIA. SO THAT IS OUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING- IS TO- MAKE MAKE THREE CHANGES AND BY THE WAY WE HAVE WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS WORKED VERY HARD TO REDUCE EXPENDITURES WE'VE SHIFTED THE LAST SEVERAL BUDGET CYCLES THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. OFF OF HER BY. ABOUT TWENTY OF THAT IS- SHIFTS TO OTHER FUNDS ABOUT SIXTEEN OF IT IS SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN OF IT IS ACTUAL. REAL CUTS AND- JUSTGIVING A FAIRLY RECENT EXAMPLE WE MOVED TO A NEW. FLOOR SPACE AND WE ARE SAVING OVER A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR READ. WE ALSO- JUST AFTER THE PANDEMIC A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER MARCH TWENTY TWENTY I GOT RID OF ALL OF OUR LAND LINES AND BOUGHT UP SELF OF THE FLIP PHONES BASICALLY FOR ALL OF OUR STAFF. AND THE NET IS ABOUT A TWO HUNDRED AND LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR SAVINGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF NOT HAVING LIMITS ANYMORE. SO WE'RE VERY FRUGAL WE TRY TO MANAGE YOUR MONEY VERY CAREFULLY NEVERTHELESS WE'RE WE'RE STUCK IN THIS POSITION SO WE HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT HAS THREE PARTS THE FIRST. IS TO RAISE THE STATUTORY CAPS RIGHT NOW THIS THE CAP IS AT THREE TENTHS OF THE MIDDLE SO POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO THREE. CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR CONSUMED BY CONSUMERS. AND WILL PROPOSE RAISING THAT TO POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO FIVE FIVE. IN THE WAY THE STATUTORY MECHANISM WORKS IS EVERY NOVEMBER THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IS EMPOWERED TO ADJUST THAT RATE COULD BE UP IT COULD BE DOWN- IT'S DONE IN A PUBLIC MEETING AND WE'VE DONE IT A COUPLE TIMES OVER THE YEARS. WHICH HAS RAISED THAT LEVEL THAT WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW TO THE STATUTORY CAP SO THAT'S ONE INCREASE THE CAP. THE SECOND IS TO TAX TAG THAT CAP TO INFLATION. THE SENATE COMMISSION REPORT BY THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH THAT FOUND THAT HAD THAT HAPPENED BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WHEN WE WERE CREATED. WE WOULD ABOUT ABOUT POINT FIVE FIVE POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO FIVE FIVE NOW- SO WE THINK TO AVOID COMING IN HERE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE THIS IS A SENSIBLE SECOND MOVE AND THEN FINALLY. BECAUSE BEHIND THE METER TODAY UP TILL TODAY HAS NOT BEEN. CONTRIBUTING TO THE- BUT SURCHARGE WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RECOMMENDS THAT WE- INCLUDE BEHIND THE METER- IN IN THE CALCULATION. INTERESTING WHAT THIS MEANS IN REAL DOLLARS. THE BUT I SURCHARGE GENERATES ABOUT SIXTY NINE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR LATELY. AND THAT TRANSLATES INTO A HEAP AND APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN CENTS. PER MONTH PER. A PAIR. IF THAT'S THE THAT THAT'S AVERAGE IF YOU'RE MAJOR RIGHT- MAJOR CONSUMER OF ELECTRICITY YOUR FIGURES GONNA BE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER BUT BUT THAT'S THE AVERAGE ACROSS ALL OUR CLASSES SO CLOSING WE THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT FOR CALIFORNIA WE ARE NOT AWARE OF TOO MANY STATE AGENCIES THAT CAN SAY THE INVESTMENTS IN WHAT WE DO RETURN ACTUAL MONEY TO THOSE WHO ARE MAKING THE INVESTMENTS NAMELY THAT THE RATE PAYERS IN CALIFORNIA BY VIRTUE OF THE CONSERVATION I DESCRIBED- AND S WE THINK THIS IS A SOUND INVESTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT FIRST I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT I THINK THAT THE US CPI- INCREASE THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS MUSIC TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFITS- ERRORS BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING HE'S BEEN PUSHING FOR A- ALL YEAR- LET'S SAY HRE FROM- THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN THE OHIO PLEASE. YEAH I THINK. IMMA NOW BEEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE- BUT SHE'D BE OUT REALLY A PROPOSED SOLUTION TO A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WITHIN THIS FUND THAT'S EXISTED FOR A FAIR AMOUNT OF YEARS NOW THAT WE'VE RETURNED- I THINK. FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN AT FINANCE- SO WERE QUESTIONING THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET- AND I THINK THE CHAIRS ARE THE DIRECTOR SUMMED IT UP WELL SO. YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS ROSS BROWN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WANT TO BEGIN OUR COMMENTS BY SAYING THAT WE DO AGREE THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY A- DEFICIT IN THE FUND AND THAT LEGISLATIVE ACTION MIGHT BE NEEDED- IN THE COMING YEARS TO PREVENT INSOLVENCY FOR THE FOR THE FUNDS HOWEVER WE DO THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING THIS PROPOSAL IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OF THE PROBLEM IN THE FUNDS ONE OF THEM IS MORE SHORT TERM AND ONE OF THEM IS LONGER TERM. ON THE SHORT TERM SIDE OF THINGS- FIRST ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS THAT THE FUND WILL GO AND WILL NOT GOING SOLVE ONCE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S A FEW YEARS FROM NOW AS A RESULT IN IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THIS YEAR- IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROVIDED A DETAILED PROJECTION OF THE FUNDING CONDITION- FIVE YEARS OUT WHICH- HAS BEEN DONE IN PREVIOUS- IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND SO THERE STILL IS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT- WHEN THE FUND WILL GO INSOLVENT WITHOUT THAT ADDITIONAL DETAIL. OF THE SECOND ON THE LONG TERM SIDE OF THINGS- THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT OVER THE LONG RUN IS ALSO UNCLEAR- THIS IS BECAUSE REVENUES ARE- AT LEAST ELECTRICITY SALES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW- UNDER THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S PROJECTIONS GOING FORWARD DUE TO STATE EFFORTS AROUND ELECTRICAL ELECTRIFICATION OF BUILDINGS AND THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR YOU CAN SEE SORT OF- SOME OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S PROJECTIONS ON PAGE SEVEN THERE'S A FIGURE ON PAGE SEVENTY SEVEN OF THE- AGENDA THAT. PROVIDES A KIND OF A MID CASE AND HIGH CASE AND SO AS A RESULT THE DEGREE TO WHICH A LONG TERM INCREASE IN THE SURCHARGE RATE IS NEEDED IT'S UNCLEAR AS RATHER. IN IN SALES. PARTIALLY UP OFF SOME OF. SOME OF THE DEFICIT. SO WITH THAT CONTEXT IN MIND WE DO THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT IT COULD CONSIDER ON THIS PROPOSAL- ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS IT COULD CONSIDER REJECTING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THIS YEAR BUT ADOPTING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT NEXT YEAR. INCLUDING A PROJECTION OF SOME OF THE LONG TERM REVENUES AND COSTS THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS YEARS THERE WAS A SIMILAR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED AND COULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO. CONTINUE TO MONITOR MONITOR CONDITION OF THE FUND AND TAKE ACTION AS NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE. IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES WANNA- MAKE CHANGES THIS YEAR TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE- IT COULD CONSIDER ADOPTING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- BUT REJECTING OTHERS SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN OUR VIEW EXTENDING THE SURCHARGE TO BEHIND THE METER CONSUMPTION COULD HELP ENSURE THAT- THE REVENUES COLLECTED MORE EQUITABLY EQUITABLY ACROSS ALL ENERGY CONSUMERS. AND WE ALSO THINK THAT TIME THE SURCHARGE TO- INFLATION IS A REASONABLE STRATEGY TO ENSURE. THAT FUTURE REVENUE WAS SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR GROWTH AND BASS LINE COSTS SUCH AS GROWTH IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR CC STAFF. IN BOTH CASES WE THINK THERE'S A PRETTY CLEAR POLICY IN FISCAL RATIONALE FOR THOSE CHANGES. I LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS TO REDUCE THINGS ON THE SPENDING SIDE OF SUCH AS SHIFTING- THERE'S ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION- IN COSTS RELATED TO THE EPIC PROGRAM THAT COULD BE SHIFTED ONTO. THE FUND THAT TYPICALLY PAYS THOSE- THOSE COSTS SO- THAT LEGISLATURE HAS TOUCHED THE SUM UP THE- MAGNITUDE OF THE OF THE ISSUE HERE THERE'S KIND OF SOME SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM CONSIDERATIONS- AND THE LEGISLATURE. THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT COULD PLAY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WELL LET ME BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- I JUST KIND OF DOVE TAIL IN THE COMMENT I MADE AND- PERHAPS. HOPEFULLY NOT STEALING ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFITS THUNDER HERE BUT- WE HEAR WE HAVE A- AN AGENCY THAT'S PROPOSING A CAR- A REGULAR COST OF LIVING INCREASE- HOW OFTEN- IN PROPOSALS LIKE THIS. IS THAT INCLUDED SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK AND IT'S- PLEASE AND WHY IS THAT MORE NOT MORE OF A- GENERALLY ADOPTED POLICY- ON WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT PROPOSAL BUT AND NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT CPI AT THREE THESE PROPOSALS OFFICE STATES COME FORTH HERE AT THE APPETITE WITH HER FAT- HAPPY KIND OF TO TAKE THAT BACK AND LOOK AT. OUR OVERALL APPROACH TO INTRODUCING CBI TO SUCH PROPOSALS THAT- WHERE IT MAKES SENSE PARTICULARLY WITH OPERATING AN OPERATING ACCOUNT FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION WOULD HAVE. CONSIDERED IT ESPECIALLY ON THE BASIS OF A LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION FROM- YOUR OWN. BODY SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH THANK YOU ALL THAT- MISTER BENNETT TO COMMENT FURTHER ON THAT IF HE IF HE'D LIKE TO BUT- OF THE LEASE FOR MY PART I THINK. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO- HEAR BACK HOW WE CAN BROADEN THE APPLICABILITY OF CPI INCREASES- ON A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS THAT MIGHT BE SIMILAR TO THIS AT LEAST- WE- THAT- MISTER BALL AND WHAT. DO WE- EXPECT TO RECEIVE A DETAILED OF THE FUND CONDITION FOR TWENTY THREE AND BEYOND- YOU MAY CHOOSE IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE- OPTIONS THAT- LEGISLATIVE ANALYST IT'S GIVEN US. AND YOUR FIRST POINT I WOULD I WOULD DEFER TO FINANCING THE OUT YOUR FUND CONDITION- THE ISSUE. AND THEN THE SECOND ISSUE OF- MISTER BROWN'S COMMENTS- WE AGREE WITH WE'RE WE AGREE WITH TWO OF THEM AND WE AND WE DISAGREE WITH ONE OF THEM- WE THINK IS RIGHT AND CPI AND- AND- BEHIND THE METER- BUT WE THINK AGAIN. HAVING THAT FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE THE UPWARD ADJUSTMENT IF WE NEED TO IS THAT THE THIRD PART THAT MAKES THIS A DURABLE SOLUTION. OKAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I'M HAPPY JUST TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION THAT WAS DEFERRED TO ME- SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS- AS TO UNDERSTAND THAT REQUEST WE GENERALLY DON'T PROVIDE OUT YOUR PHONE CONDITION STATEMENTS BUT HAVE- WHEN REQUIRED BY SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE WE WILL- LOOK TO TRY AND ADDRESS THAT CONCERN BY- THE LEGISLATURE IN TRYING TO PROVIDE SOMETHING AND- THAT'S RESPONSIVE- GENERALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- WHEN WE'RE PROJECTING INSOLVENCY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE IS JUST A FLAT BINDING OF EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES- AND THAT BRINGS US TO INSOLVENCY BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BUT HAPPY TO PROVIDE. SOMETHING THAT'S RESPONSIVE THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT SO. THANK YOU. MISTER BENNETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AB I THINK CHAIR BLOOM COVERED THE CPI ISSUES VERY WELL SO I DON'T NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME ON THAT- I THINK PARTICULAR HIS QUESTION ABOUT TRYING TO EXPAND THE SO WE HAVE AS MANY PROGRAMS AS POSSIBLE COVERED WITH THE WITH THE CPI- OF IT IN GENERAL- I RESPECTFULLY- THE DILIGENCE OF THE L. A. IN TERMS OF SAYING DO WE REALLY NEED TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW. CENTER AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE- THIS. WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS AT HIM TO TRY TO DRESSES FOR ME THE TENSION. THAT I LIKE TO HAVE THAT THE RIGHT BALANCE ON THIS AND NOT HAVE THE DEPARTMENT FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BUDGET IS. SO GENEROUS THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THE CONSTANT- INCENTIVE TO DO THINGS LIKE WHAT YOU DID WAS YOUR- PHONE SYSTEM- AND SAVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS- AT AT THE SAME TIME. WE WANT C. E. C. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE REALLY ALL NEED TO DO IS ARE AGENCIES NEED TO THINK MORE PROACTIVELY. AND PLAN AHEAD- WE JUST HAD SOME PRETTY. SHOCKING THE NEWS COMING OUT ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH HER READ TO IN THE FUTURE- AND SO- HI BUT WANT US TO BE IF WE IF WE WANT TO BE PROACTIVE FIGHT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS ISSUE OF THE BUDGET CONSTRAINT CONSTANTLY SORT OF GETTING IN THE WAY OF THAT SO. I WITH THAT I'D BE SUPPORTIVE OF MOVING FORWARD AT THIS POINT IN TIME- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT WE DO CONSTANTLY GET THOSE. PROJECTIONS AL SO THAT WE DON'T MAKE THIS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE L. A- TRYING TO GET THE INFORMATION AND AN ADMINISTRATION HAVING THE INFORMATION BUT INSTEAD. HAVE THE SENSE THAT THOSE LONG TERM PROJECTIONS IF THAT'S WHAT THE YOU KNOW HELPS L. A. IN TERMS OF DOING THEIR ANALYSIS. AT THAT WOULD HAPPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE- AT TELEPHONE SYSTEM SAVINGS WHICH IT. AT FIVE VERY INTERESTING A FIVE I'M A NEW MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC. AND I WANT TO REACH THE CC. WHAT TURK- I IT TASTES SOON THE SAME PHONE NUMBER YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD IS AVAILABLE WHERE DOES THAT GO HOW DOES THAT ALL WORK SO WE'VE GOT THREE- THREE WAYS TO REACH FOLKS BY PHONE THE FIRST IS WEEK WE DID SAVE A COUPLE OF LINES I THINK WE SAVE TWO OR THREE. TOTAL LINES OUT OF SEVEN HUNDRED- SO THAT'S ONE WIN SO THERE'S A THERE'S A MAIN NUMBER- AND THEN SECOND OF ALL WE HAVE WE'VE WE'VE HISTORICALLY HAD SMARTPHONES FOR. SENIOR FOLKS WHO TRAVEL AND OTHERWISE REALLY BENEFIT BY HAVING- THAT KIND OF A PHONE AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAS A PHONE WITH A NUMBER- AND SOIT'S IT IT'S TRANSPARENT ANYBODY ON THE OUTSIDE WHETHER THEY'RE CALLING ON A CELLPHONE OR LANDLINE SO. IT THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE. BUT A AGAIN IF- IF SOMEBODY CAN YOU JUST WALK ME THROUGH IT- HOW HOW THE STRUCTURE WORKS FOR THE SYSTEM WORKS. IF IF I WERE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WANTED TO CALL IN AND SAY I REACH YOUR OFFICE YEP- THAT CALL COMES IN. AND THAT GOES TO A- ESSENTIALLY A LANDLINE OR VOIP RIGHT- BUT TYPE OF SET UP AND THEN WHATWHAT HAPPENS SO IT IT ROTORS OVER TO- MY COLLEAGUES WHO WHO GETS ALL THOSE CALLS AND- SHE GENERALLY ANSWERS THEM IF HE'S NOT THERE IT GOES TO- IT. BECAUSE WHO VOICEMAIL AND THEIR CHECKED DAILY- MULTIPLE TIMES DAILY AND SO THERE'S WE'RE- VERY RESPONSIVE THAT WAY. AND THAT SYSTEM IS WORKING FOR- OFFERED A PART YEAH SO FAR SO GOOD IT'S BEEN GREAT. SO IF FIVE- HOW DOES THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND JUST STRUCTURALLY WITH AND- THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENT OF YOUR HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH THAT- HOW DO WE TRANSLATE THAT INTO ADOPTION OTHER AGENCIES HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN. BY PROMINENT THE BEST PERSON TO ASK BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE ZERO F. AS YEAH UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T RESPONSIBLE THAT KIND OF HAPPY TAKE THAT BACK- YOU KNOW IT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE ADOPTING- SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A BEST PRACTICE. HOW DO WE- EXPAND THAT TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT MIGHT BENEFIT FROM THAT- ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS- IT IS IN THE NATURE OF BUREAUCRACIES TO- CONTINUE TO DO THINGS YEAR AFTER YEAR- EVEN AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES WE'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS- WITH OUR AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A- CERTAINLY A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO GO AROUND- BUT WE'VE HAD SOME FAILINGS BECAUSE OF FAILURE TO ADOPT- TECHNOLOGY- HAVING A- SYSTEM. IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS EVERYONE TO SHARE SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES- WITH. CERTAINLY BE USEFUL I WOULD. ASSEMBLY BENNETT'S POINT IS WELL. AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY FRUGAL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS- WE HAVE. GONE THROUGH THE COUCH CUSHIONS YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR EVERY POSSIBLE PLACE SO THIS WAS A NATURAL THING FOR US WHEN COLBERT HIT- TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND- OUR STAFF HAVE REALLY ENJOYED IT THE ABILITY. TO TELEWORK BROADLY AND HAVE TAKEN TAKEN. GOOD ADVANTAGE OF IT IN THE METRICS WE HAVE TO JUDGE- PRODUCTIVITY TO SUGGEST THAT OUR OUR OUR PRODUCTIVITY GOING UP RATHER THAN DOWN AS SOME FOLKS PRE PANDEMIC. THOUGHT THAT BEING OUT OF THE OFFICE MIGHT MIGHT MIGHT SUGGEST.
