COUNTRY. RIGHT IN THE STATE OF

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:13.291
CALIFORNIA. IS- GIVES MUCH OF

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:16.528
THE CONTROL TO LOCAL FOLKS I

00:28:16.594 --> 00:28:18.563
WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I WAS

A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE AND

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:23.902
I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT THAT IT

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:28.139
IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE- OTHER

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:29.974
COUNTRIES HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT

00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:40.852
FORM. OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AB

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:41.920
COUNTRY LIKE MY JAPAN ARE VERY

00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:42.987
MUCH MORE CENTRAL RIGHT WHERE

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.656
WE'RE MAYBE WHAT IS TAUGHT

00:28:44.722 --> 00:28:45.223
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY MAYBE

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.158
VERY SIMILAR IF YOU WENT FROM

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:49.294
OR OR- IF YOU WENT A ONE SCHOOL

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.897
TO ANOTHER. BUT HERE WE-

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:55.567
BECAUSE WE ARE DEMOCRACY WE

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:59.571
INTENTIONALLY MAKE- EDUCATION-

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:01.673
OF THE FORM THAT THAT EVERYONE

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:04.142
CAN PARTICIPATE IN AND WE GIVE

00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:07.011
UP PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:11.382
INPUT AND SO THAT IS HOW.

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:12.083
ETHNIC STUDY IS BEING

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.452
IMPLEMENTED IN THE PAST THREE

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:17.155
YEARS. AS YOU MAY KNOW READ THE

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:19.324
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I CAME

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.228
UP WITH A MODEL CURRICULUM- IT

00:29:23.294 --> 00:29:23.695
WENT THROUGH DIFFERENT

00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:27.098
REVISIONS. MUCH MANY HEARINGS A

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:30.502
LOT OF PUBLIC INPUT- IT WAS A-

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:34.973
RE DONE. AND NOW THIS LAST

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:38.076
MARCH IT CAME OUT OF THE MODEL

00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:41.679
CURRICULUM AS ESTABLISHED BY

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:44.482
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:45.283
THAT MODEL CURRICULUM IS JUST

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.752
THAT IT IS A MODEL FOR LOCAL

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.587
SCHOOL BOARDS LOCAL SCHOOL

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:54.125
DISTRICTS TO USE AS THEY

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:56.694
IMPLEMENT ETHNIC STUDIES THERE

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:59.230
ARE TWENTY DISTRICTS ALREADY-

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:02.734
WHO ARE FOR. OR REQUIRED I

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.003
THINK STUDIES AS A AS A

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:07.372
GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. AND SO

00:30:07.438 --> 00:30:08.706
WE SEE DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:12.210
STATE. SOMETIMES HOTLY DEBATING

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:15.113
RIGHT WHAT FORM OF ETHNIC

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.783
STUDIES SHOULD TAKE. AND I

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.684
THINK THAT WE HEAR IN THE

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:23.087
LEGISLATURE NEED TO HAVE FAITH

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:25.256
IN THE SYSTEM THE THAT WE

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:27.392
CREATED IN A SYSTEM OF

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:31.563
EDUCATION. THAT WE HAVE- RELIED

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:36.601
ON AND THAT WORKS AND THAT AND

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:39.637
THAT IS PART TO HAVE FAITH ALSO

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:43.641
IN THE DEMOCRATIC- PROCESS THAT

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:46.978
IT IS THROUGH DISCUSSION. AND

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:49.147
THROUGH GIVE AND TAKE THAT- THE

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:54.485
BEST CATION I THINK IS ACHIEVED

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:55.253
AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.322
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE ETHNIC

00:30:57.388 --> 00:31:00.592
STUDIES. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.660
I WAS A TEACHER FOR THIRTY FOUR

00:31:02.727 --> 00:31:05.096
YEARS. A SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:05.597
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:08.099
CALIFORNIA. WILL USE THE MODEL

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:12.870
CURRICULUM. TO FORM THEIR OWN

00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:16.074
CURRICULUM IN IN THE SCHOOLS-

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.978
BASED ON THE MODEL CURRICULUM

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:22.680
BUT ALSO GIVEN THE LOCAL

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:26.150
HISTORY AND POPULATION AND I

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:28.052
THINK THAT MAKES SENSE YOU KNOW

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:30.655
WE SAY HERE MANY TIMES THAT ONE

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:32.790
SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND I

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.959
BELIEVE THAT SO THE MODEL

00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:37.028
CURRICULUM IS JUST THAT SCHOOL

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:41.266
DISTRICTS WILL USE IT. USE IT-

00:31:41.332 --> 00:31:45.670
AS A MODEL TO MAKE A BEST FIT.

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:49.474
A LOCAL AREA. AND SOMETIMES A

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.843
DEMOCRAT DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:55.313
IS MESSY. BUT WE SHOULD NOT SHY

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.914
AWAY FROM HAVING DIFFICULT

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.816
DISCUSSIONS BUT I THINK THAT IS

00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:01.052
SORT OF VIA THE PROCESSES THAT

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.954
WILL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:04.889
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:06.691

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:58.863
IN RED BLUFF VENTURA RED BLUFF

00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:01.766
IS. BUT I AGREED WITH HIM ON

00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:05.669
THAT- THAT THAT WE NEED A

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:07.605
CURRICULUM THAT THAT YOU KNOW

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:12.143
FITS. IN IN THE LOCAL AREAS.

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:13.444
BUT I THINK THE WORK OF THE

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:14.979
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS

00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:18.649
GOTTEN IS THERE- I WOULD

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.785
DISAGREE RESPECTFULLY THAT

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:23.654
THIS. SO CALLED LIBERATED

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:24.922
ETHNIC STUDIES IS THE ONLY

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:26.423
THING THAT'S OUT THERE I DON'T

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.559
THINK THAT'S TRUE THE MODEL

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:32.196
CURRICULUM THAT THE STATE. HAS

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:35.666
IS NINE HUNDRED PAGES. NINE

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:36.233
HUNDRED PAGES THAT INCLUDES

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:40.271
LESSON PLANS- APPENDICES-

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:43.340
RESOURCES. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:48.212
TO USE. AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:50.648
THE TIMING OF THE BILL. AS I

00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:54.485
SAID AT THE OUTSET BUT THIS.

00:40:54.552 --> 00:40:58.022
WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT. UNTIL

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:58.622
STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING IN THE

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:03.227
YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY NINE TWENTY

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:04.562
THIRTY WHICH MEANS IT WOULDN'T

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:09.633
HAVE TO BE IN PLACE. AND TELL

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.801
TWENTY TWENTY SIX. I BELIEVE

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:12.736
FOR GRADUATES TO GRADUATE IN

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.572
TWENTY TWENTY NINE. IN OTHER

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:17.508
WORDS WE ARE GIVING. I THINK

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:19.810
OUT AMPLE TIME TO SCHOOL

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:21.679
DISTRICTS TO SCHOOLS OF

00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:25.015
EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA TO WORK

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.984
ON JUST THAT CENTER DOLLY ON

00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:29.019
THE CURRICULUM ON HOW AND

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:34.158
TRAINING TEACHERS- EIGHT ZERO

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:37.761
IT IT'S A BIG STEP. UP NO DOUBT.

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:41.565
BUT I THINK THAT IF IT IS.

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:44.468
SOMETHING THAT IS OVERDUE. IN

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:47.304
THIS STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:49.707
AS A TEACHER OF US HISTORY. THE

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:52.276
THERE IS SO MUCH OF OUR OWN

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:55.512
HISTORY THAT IS LEFT OUT. OF A

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:57.948
OF THE CURRICULUM NOW. IN THAT

00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:00.017
STUDENTS LIKE WE HEARD ARE

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:02.620
CLAMORING FOR- TO SEE

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:05.122
THEMSELVES IN THE CURRICULUM

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:08.559
YOU KNOW THAT I COULDN'T. BEGIN

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:11.662
WITH THE STORY OF ANGEL ISLAND.

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:16.033
AND THEN- CHINESE IMMIGRATION-

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.303
WITH WITH THE TREATY WELL LOU

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.006
BAY THAT'LL ENDED THE MEXICAN

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:24.441
WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES- THE

00:42:24.508 --> 00:42:26.977
TO DO RIGHTS WITH THE GREAT

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:31.782
MIGRATION. OF AFRICAN AMERICANS

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:33.984
FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH ALL

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:36.687
THESE STORIES STORY OF CHINESE

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:38.756
AMERICANS IN THE RAILROADS ALL

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:42.493
THESE STORIES- NEED TO BE TOLD

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:44.795
AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT SO

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:46.563
THAT IS WHY WE ARE HEARING FROM

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.632
STUDENTS WHO ARE SAYING THAT

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:49.166
THEY WANT TO SEE IT THANK

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:51.235
STUDIES IMPLEMENT I THINK WE

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:53.237
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT. IN

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:58.108
THE STATE. I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS

00:42:58.175 --> 00:43:00.844
AGAIN- I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:04.181
THE FACT THAT. WE NEED TO TEACH

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:06.116
GOOD ACTORS HISTORY AND- BUT IN

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:09.019
DOING THAT. THE GOAL IS TO

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:10.587
UNITE US NOT DIVIDE US THAT'S

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:13.524
THAT'S I THINK WHY THIS IS THIS

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:18.896
IS OBVIOUSLY A CAN- IT'S DRIVEN

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:20.531
BY MOTION IS DRIVEN BY THERE'S

00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:21.265
LOTS OF THINGS THAT THAT WE

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:23.233
NEED TO LEARN SO I JUST WANT TO

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.270
ON MY OWN TIME MANAGER I I'M

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:29.006
BILL TODAY- AND I KNOW THAT

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.908
YOU'VE WORKED REALLY HARD AT IT

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:32.443
TO THE WHICH YOU ALWAYS DO ON

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:34.778
YOUR BILLS BUT I JUST WANTED

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:36.347
TO. SHARE SOME THOUGHTS THAT.

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:38.148
WHY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:39.550
PARENTS AND I'M ONE OF THOSE

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:41.819
PARENTS WHO HOUSE OTHER THAN AN

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:43.988
ELEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER- WHO

00:43:44.054 --> 00:43:45.823
IS. IS ATTENDING A PRIVATE

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:49.827
SCHOOL- RIGHT NOW BUT WAS. THAT

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.428
WHEN WE WERE WHEN WE HAD HER IN

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:54.331
SCHOOL IN BEEPER BEFORE BOTH OF

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:56.166
US BECAME ELECTED HERE- WE

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:56.934
BROUGHT HER TO SACRAMENTO SO

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:58.635
SHE'S GETTING EDUCATION HERE IT

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:00.704
IS IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL. BUT

00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:02.906
BOTH MY SONS AND MY DAUGHTER

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:03.774
FOR THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF HER

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:06.643
LIFE ATTENDED PUBLIC SCHOOL SO.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.212
VERY MUCH ENGAGED IN THAT

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:11.048
PROCESS AND WHAT ENDS UP

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:13.450
HAPPENING- IN MY OPINION IS. A

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:16.787
LOT OF GOOD. CURRICULUM IS

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:18.622
THOUGHT OUT IN BUT IT GETS

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.624
STORED ALONG THE WAY AND ACCESS

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:21.925
FOR THE PARENTS AND I AND I'M

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:24.461
BACKING UP TO MY- TO MY BILL ON

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:25.963
SEX EDUCATION THAT I HAD

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.198
EARLIER THIS YEAR AND- THE

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:29.566
ABILITY FOR PARENTS TO WAY AND

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.335
MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT AND-

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.604
THAT WORK. AND THE SCHOOLS

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:34.171
AREN'T VERY TRANSPARENT AND

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:37.007
PEOPLE ARE EXITING. PUBLIC

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:39.009
SCHOOLS. INCLUDING MYSELF. I

00:44:39.076 --> 00:44:41.111
HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO SEND. MY

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:42.246
CHILD TO PUBLIC SCHOOL AND I

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:44.014
AND I HATE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE-

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:47.484
I PAY FOR. NEARLY PAY FOR AND I

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.118
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:49.953
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.487
QUESTIONING WHAT WE REALLY

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:54.758
GETTING. AND THE PARENTS OF

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:55.325
THESE CHILDREN DON'T BELIEVE

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:57.361
THEY'RE GETTING. WHAT THEY WANT

00:44:57.428 --> 00:45:00.130
THEIR CHILDREN TO BE TAUGHT.

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:00.731
AND SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:04.568
OUT A WAY. TO BRING THOSE BRING

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:06.403
EVERYBODY AND NOT JUST THE KIDS

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.072
THAT HAVE DON'T HAVE THE

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:09.206
ABILITY OR THE PARENTS OF THE

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:11.175
BELIEVE IT TAKE ANOTHER CHOICE.

00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:14.845
WE'VE WE'VE PUSHED OUT CHARTER

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:15.712
SCHOOLS WE DON'T FUND IN THE

00:45:15.779 --> 00:45:18.115
SAME WAY AS WE- FUND PUBLIC

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:18.749
SCHOOLS AND THERE'S A AN ATTACK

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:20.884
ON. ANYBODY THAT TRIES TO GET

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.853
AWAY FROM A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.488
REALLY IN MY OPINION DOING A

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:25.789
GREAT JOB SO THOSE ARE JUST

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:27.524
SOME THOUGHTS OF MINE. BUT I

00:45:27.591 --> 00:45:28.725
THINK THE PUBLIC IS OUT THERE

00:45:28.792 --> 00:45:31.161
GRASPING WITH AND THE ABILITY

00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:32.096
FOR THEIR MONEY TO FALL THEIR

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:35.699
CHILD. AND THEN GET ACCESS TO

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.000
WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING TAUGHT.

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:38.602
IS VERY FRUSTRATING. AND I

00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:41.105
THINK THIS BILL. EVENTUALLY

00:45:41.171 --> 00:45:43.507
WILL BE THE SAME AS PLATE SPACE

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:45.742
THAT MY SEX WHICH WHICH IS

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.811
WHERE SEX EDUCATION IS THAT IS

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:51.181
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ACCESS. IT

00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:52.382
AND ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IS BEING

00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:53.917
TAUGHT BECAUSE HOW IT'S BEING

00:45:53.984 --> 00:45:56.220
TAUGHT. AND WHAT IS BEING

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.655
TAUGHT IS CRITICAL IT'S YOUNG

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:01.692
MINDS TO. HOPEFULLY BRING US

00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:03.694
TOGETHER NOT DIVIDE US APART ON

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.661
WHERE WE THINK OUR CHILDREN TO

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:06.196
GO AND PARENTS SEEM TO BE PART

00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:07.898
OF THAT SOLUTION AND WHEN THEY

00:46:07.965 --> 00:46:09.032
DON'T FEEL THEY CAN'T THEY TRY

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:09.967
TO EXIT BUT WHEN THEY TRY TO

00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:12.803
EXIT. THE MONEY DOESN'T FALL SO

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.471
THOSE ARE JUST SOME THOUGHTS

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:15.372
APPRECIATE YOU AS AN AUTHOR AND

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:17.641
A FRIEND- BUT I WON'T BE ABLE

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:19.276
TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY.

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:21.345
THANK YOU MISTER DOLLY- SENATOR

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.813
I HAVE TO SAY I WHOLEHEARTEDLY

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.981
DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT OUR

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:25.916
PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. I

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:27.718
THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY.

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:29.553
IN THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.355
TO DO BETTER. AND WHEN WE FIND

00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:33.490
A PROBLEM. TO TRY AND FIX IT

00:46:33.557 --> 00:46:34.558
AND MAKE PUBLIC EDUCATION

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:36.393
BETTER FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND I

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.061
WOULD ALSO JUST SAY THAT. I

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:39.630
THINK JUST THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:41.565
YOU SAID ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES.

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:42.666
I THINK IT BRINGS US CLOSER

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:44.635
TOGETHER. BECAUSE I THINK THAT

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:46.770
WE FIND OUT WE ARE HAVE MORE IN

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:48.839
COMMON. THAN THAT NOT. WHEN WE

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:50.207
LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER WE LEARN

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:51.375
THAT WE ALL HAVE FAMILIES WE

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.243
ALL LEARNED THAT WE HELPED. HER

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.778
YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL PEOPLE

00:46:54.845 --> 00:46:57.381
TRYING TO. TO SURVIVE IN THIS

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:58.315
WORLD SO I THINK THAT MAKE

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.584
CITIES. BRINGS US CLOSER

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:02.419
TOGETHER- BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:05.789
COMMENTS LET ME JUST SAY I'M

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:06.790
NOT OPPOSED TO ETHNIC STUDIES.

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:08.158
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:10.060
DO IT IN A WAY. THAT IT'S

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:11.395
INCLUSIVE AND THAT PEOPLE GET

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:14.198
TO BE. I'M NOT I'M NOT BECAUSE

00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:15.832
I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAY I'M

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:16.600
NOT DISAGREEING THE ETHNIC

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.268
STUDIES ART. SOMETHING WE

00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:20.070
SHOULD TEACH ABSOLUTELY IT'S

00:47:20.137 --> 00:47:22.306
MAKING SURE THAT. IT IS THE

00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:23.407
CURRICULUM THAT IS OUT THERE

00:47:23.473 --> 00:47:25.709
IS. ACCURATE AND BRINGS US

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:27.811
TOGETHER AND NOT USED TO DEVISE

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.913
A PART OR- AGAINST ONE OF THE

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.747
OTHER THAT'S WHAT AND THAT'S

00:47:30.814 --> 00:47:32.049
WHAT I'VE HEARD AND I'VE BEEN

00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:33.917
HEARING. FROM MY DISTRICT I

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:35.018
DON'T DISAGREE THAT WE SHOULD

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:36.887
HAVE IT. I THINK WE SHOULD IT'S

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.222
NOT A PROBLEM BUT IT'S HOW WE

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:40.224
DO IT THAT MATTERS. AGAIN I

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.692
WOULD SAY TO THAT THE

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:42.526
CURRICULUM THAT YOU FIRST

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.595
MENTIONED. HAS BEEN CHANGED IN

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:46.496
THIS BILL THE MASTER CURRICULUM

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:47.431
SOME OF THE POINTS HE TALKED

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:48.932
ABOUT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT AND

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:50.801
CHANGE THE AUTHOR DID THAT. TO

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.469
MAKE IT MORE INCLUSIVE SO YOU

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.004
KNOW I THINK AS A SOCIETY WE

00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:54.871
TRY TO JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:56.206
RIGHT. ALL RIGHT TO HAVE ANY

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:58.542
OTHER FURTHER COMMENTS

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:00.544
QUESTIONS CENTER PAN. THANK YOU

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:03.914
THANK YOU- AND- IT REALLY

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:05.549
FREESHEET THE DISCUSSION- BUT I

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:07.384
DO IT JUST MAKE THE OBSERVATION

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:09.653
THAT. ACTUALLY THE TONES WERE

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.189
CONCERNED THAT DESPITE THE

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:14.191
CHANGES THAT WERE MADE AND THE-

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:15.726
STATE CURRICULUM THAT THEY'RE

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:16.693
CONCERNED WHAT HAPPENED AND

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.197
LOCAL AREAS INTERESTING ENOUGH-

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:21.431
WE ACTUALLY WANT MORE LOCAL

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:23.233
INPUT AND CONTROL RIGHT AND

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.034
THAT'S HOW WE SET UP OUR

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:27.804
SYSTEM. SO I THINK THIS IS A

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:31.508
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:32.376
AND THEN JUST FOR THE WORK TO

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:34.544
DO I AGREE YOU KNOW PARENTS AND

00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:36.580
SCHOOL BOARDS AND TEACHERS NEED

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:37.748
TO WORK TOGETHER AND EACH

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:40.751
LOCALITY. SO THE PEOPLE OF OUR

00:48:40.817 --> 00:48:41.985
RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS. WELL

00:48:42.052 --> 00:48:45.822
ENGAGE BECAUSE WE DON'T WE

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.224
DON'T DICTATE IT FROM THE TOP

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.859
WE'RE ESTABLISHING A GRADUATION

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:50.494
REQUIREMENT BUT EXACTLY AND I

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.528
APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:53.664
THE ODDS BROAD SUPPORT FOR

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.966
ETHNIC STUDIES HERE- SO I THINK

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.167
THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AREA OF

00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.268
COMMON AGREEMENT TO APPRECIATE

00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:00.337
THAT AND THEN HOW WE IMPLEMENT

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:03.373
THAT- WILL TAKE ON A VARIETY OF

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.942
DIFFERENT- WAYS DEPENDING ON

00:49:06.009 --> 00:49:06.810
HOW EACH OF OUR LOCAL

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:08.278
COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER TO DO

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.414
THAT. SO THAT'S BOTH AN

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.115
OPPORTUNITY I ALSO HEAR THIS

00:49:12.182 --> 00:49:13.116
YEAR THE OPPONENTS ABOUT WHAT

00:49:13.183 --> 00:49:15.018
THAT MEANS BUT I HOPE THAT WE

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:15.919
CAN SEE THIS AND OPPORTUNITIES

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:17.421
A ORGANIZATION HERE'S A

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:18.822
LEGISLATURE WE'VE OFTEN TALKED

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:19.723
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.091
CONTROL LOCAL ENGAGEMENT THAT'S

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:22.759
HOW WE SET UP OUR EDUCATION

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:25.429
SYSTEM SO- SO LET'S GO AHEAD

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:27.097

QUESTION AND I CHUCKLED

00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:10.634
UNDERNEATH MY MASK BECAUSE AS-

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:15.272

SENATE- THIS BILL AS YOU

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:29.453
PROBABLY KNOW WA VETOED TWICE

00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:31.621
IN THE LAST TIME IT WAS VETOED.

00:51:31.688 --> 00:51:34.658
BY OUR GOVERNOR IT WAS JUST

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:36.860
BECAUSE OF THE CURRICULUM THAT

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:39.830
HE DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:40.730
WITH WITH THE CURRICULUM AS IT

00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:43.500

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:47.737
MORE BALANCED CURRICULUM. AND

THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW. A

00:51:50.073 --> 00:51:53.109
MORE BALANCED CURRICULUM- THE

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:53.743

PRESENTING THE BILL- I THINK

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:07.757
THAT IF WE WOULD GO TO STUDENTS

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:10.093
STUDENTS WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.263
LONG OVERDUE- ETHNIC STUDIES

FIFTY YEARS OF NEW KNOWLEDGE-

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.678
THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED

00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:31.615
PRODUCED BY ACADEMICS. PRODUCED

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:34.251
BY HISTORIANS. THAT IS NOT

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:37.220
INCLUDED IN OUR CURRICULUM SO I

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:39.756

SOMETHING THAT IS TAUGHT. IN

AT FURTHER THE STUDIES HAVE

01:53:34.774 --> 01:53:37.343
BEEN DONE TO SHOW IF HE PLAYS A

01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:39.779
MALE TEACHER WHICH AGAIN WE ARE

01:53:39.846 --> 01:53:40.947
NEW IN MUNICH IN THIS

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:44.117
PARTICULAR AREA- TO TRY TO SHOW

01:53:44.184 --> 01:53:47.287
YOUNG STUDENTS- ROLE MODELS.

01:53:47.353 --> 01:53:48.254
THAT LOOK LIKE THEM THE

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:50.590
REFLECTS THEM- AND THE TEACHER

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:53.593
AND THE STUDENT OUTCOME- AND

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.295
THROUGH THE STUDIES THAT HAVE

01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:58.231
SHOWN IS THAT- IT REDUCES DROP

01:53:58.298 --> 01:54:00.400
OUT IT REDUCES A NUMBER OF

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:01.768
DIFFERENT THINGS AND IT ALSO

01:54:01.834 --> 01:54:03.303
CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:05.572
STUDENTS TO GO INTO EDUCATION

01:54:05.638 --> 01:54:06.773

01:54:06.839 --> 01:54:08.541
REALLY WANT TO AIM AT TO TRY TO

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:10.810
BOOST- THAT'S REASON WHY THAT.

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:12.912
THE MONEY IS PLACED IN THE POT

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.013
THAT THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.882
THROUGH THE BUDGET TO INCREASE-

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:20.920

WORKFORCE- WE TRY TO FIT UP.

01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:23.489
THAT EXIST IN THE PROBLEM THAT

01:54:23.556 --> 01:54:25.291
I SEE EXISTS IS THAT THERE'S A

01:54:25.358 --> 01:54:27.860
LACK OF MALE TEACHERS- IN

01:54:27.927 --> 01:54:29.662

01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:53.052
THAT WE NEED MORE DIVERSITY NOT

01:54:53.119 --> 01:54:54.554
ONLY THE TEACHING RANKS BUT IN

01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:57.624
THE MINISTRY RANKS AS WELL. AND

01:54:57.690 --> 01:55:00.860

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:02.395
I DISAGREE WITH ANY OPPOSITION

01:55:02.462 --> 01:55:04.163
IT WAS THE OTHERWISE. WHAT I

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:05.431
WAS REALLY ASKING IS MORE OR

01:55:05.498 --> 01:55:07.033
MORE NARAL QUESTION IN THE

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:10.036
ANALYSIS. THE GNOSIS OF YOUR

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:12.405
BILL. IT SAYS THIS YEAR'S

01:55:12.472 --> 01:55:15.408

GRANT PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:25.051
WOULD REQUIRE THE CTC TO MAKE

01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:27.153
ONE TIME GRANTS DALY IS. TO

MEAN TEACHER SHORTAGE. FIELDS I

01:55:39.132 --> 01:55:41.301

OTHER VITAL SERVICES FOR YEARS-

02:00:43.603 --> 02:00:45.805
THESE MAY BE VERY GOOD USES OF

02:00:45.871 --> 02:00:49.275
THE MONEY. IT MAY BE THAT THESE

02:00:49.342 --> 02:00:51.777
TAX BREAKS CREATE MORE BUSINESS

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:54.614
AND WE MAKE MORE. FROM THE

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:56.682
BUSINESS THEY BRING AND WE LOSE

PROGRAMS HAVE JUST BEEN AROUND

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:04.090
FOR A LONG TIME. THE MORE

02:01:04.156 --> 02:01:07.259
RECENT PROGRAMS WE REVIEW THEM

FRUSTRATED WITH THE YEARS THAT

PROGRESS BEING MADE IN THIS

02:28:04.942 --> 02:28:06.744
SPACE AND WE ALL RECOGNIZE. HOW

02:28:06.811 --> 02:28:08.713
CONSEQUENTIAL THIS IS TO SO

02:28:08.779 --> 02:28:11.315
MANY STUDENTS. THAT THOUGHT

02:28:11.382 --> 02:28:12.016
THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT

02:28:12.083 --> 02:28:14.218
THING. IN IN THEIR COMMUNITY

02:28:14.285 --> 02:28:16.020
COLLEGE CLASS. AND THEN

02:28:16.087 --> 02:28:17.788
REALIZING THAT ALL THOSE UNITS

02:28:17.855 --> 02:28:20.258
AND ALL THAT TIME. AND GRANTED

02:28:20.324 --> 02:28:21.225
ANY KIND OF LEARNING IS A

02:28:21.292 --> 02:28:22.693
HEALTHY THING IN A WONDERFUL

02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:24.996

ZERO. WHEN IT CAME TO GETTING.

02:28:27.698 --> 02:28:29.867
PROGRESS TO DEGREE. AND THEN

02:28:29.934 --> 02:28:31.269
THIS IS IT AN INCREDIBLE

02:28:31.335 --> 02:28:35.339
FAILURE THAT I SAW. BACK IN THE

02:28:35.406 --> 02:28:38.576
200-015-2000 SIXTEEN PERIOD.

02:28:38.643 --> 02:28:39.176
AND IT FRUSTRATED THE HECK OUT

02:28:39.243 --> 02:28:40.678
OF US. AND WE ASKED A LOT OF

02:28:40.745 --> 02:28:41.912
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THE

02:28:41.979 --> 02:28:44.982
FACULTY. WERE NOT ENGAGING AND

02:28:45.049 --> 02:28:47.018
CERTIFYING THESE COURSES. ARE

02:28:47.084 --> 02:28:49.820
THESE DAYS IS- BRAIN SURGERY

02:28:49.887 --> 02:28:50.955
WERE TRYING TO CERTIFY THESE

02:28:51.022 --> 02:28:52.923
COURSES NO FOLKS. THESE ARE

02:28:52.990 --> 02:28:55.026
INTRODUCTORY COURSES THESE ARE

02:28:55.092 --> 02:28:57.128
THE MOST BASIC COURSES. IN OUR

02:28:57.194 --> 02:28:58.529
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN ANY

02:28:58.596 --> 02:29:00.264
SUBJECT AREA. WHETHER IT'S

02:29:00.331 --> 02:29:03.701
ENGLISH OR MATH OR LANGUAGE.

02:29:03.768 --> 02:29:04.802
THIS WAS IN A COMPLICATED

02:29:04.869 --> 02:29:06.470
THING. AND I THINK THAT OUR

02:29:06.537 --> 02:29:09.440
FACULTY. IN ALL OF THESE.

02:29:09.507 --> 02:29:11.442
SEGMENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO GET

02:29:11.509 --> 02:29:12.476
TOGETHER AND FIGURE THIS THING

02:29:12.543 --> 02:29:15.513
OUT. WHEN WE WERE SEEN TRAIN

02:29:15.579 --> 02:29:17.782
WRECKS HAPPENING EVERY YEAR.

02:29:17.848 --> 02:29:20.551
WITH THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS.

02:29:20.618 --> 02:29:22.086
DOING THE WRONG THING. FROM AN

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:23.321
INSTITUTION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO

02:29:23.387 --> 02:29:25.523
HELP THEM DO THE RIGHT THING.

02:29:25.589 --> 02:29:27.591
AND GET THEM ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

02:29:27.658 --> 02:29:29.460
AND SO WE GET TO WATCH EVERY

02:29:29.527 --> 02:29:32.496
YEAR THAT TRAIN CRASH HAPPENING.

02:29:32.563 --> 02:29:33.597

HIGHER EDUCATION THEY ARE THE

02:29:35.366 --> 02:29:37.735

HAVE IN OUR STATE THAT EVERY

02:29:39.737 --> 02:29:41.539

THIS PROBLEM IS STUNNING. IT IS

02:30:03.294 --> 02:30:05.796
A COMPLETE FAILURE. OF OUR

BUT COMPLETION MY FRIENDS.

02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:30.688
