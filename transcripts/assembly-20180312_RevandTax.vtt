00:27:49.635 --> 00:27:52.771 region:rollup2
I WE'VE MASTERED THE CARL MOYER

THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN A GREAT

00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:59.545 region:rollup2
TOOL AND DIE IN ORDER TO GET

00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:01.113 region:rollup2
EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM HEAVY

00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:03.248 region:rollup2
DUTY MOBILE EQUIPMENT.

00:28:01.113 --> 00:28:04.783 region:rollup2
BOTH IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:05.751 region:rollup2
THE SOUTH COAST WHERE WE HAVE

00:28:04.783 --> 00:28:07.586 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AIR QUALITY

00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:09.154 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES HEAVY EQUIPMENT THE

00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:10.522 region:rollup2
SINGLE LARGEST EMISSION SOURCE

00:28:09.154 --> 00:28:11.857 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:13.759 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS.

00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:14.493 region:rollup2
AND WHILE THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:17.429 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

00:28:14.493 --> 00:28:18.330 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE FORWARD REACHING OUT

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:20.299 region:rollup2
TO MORE AND MORE SMALL

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.867 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE THAT.

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:23.435 region:rollup2
THE UP FRONT COST IS REALLY AN

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:25.337 region:rollup2
ISSUE WHILE IT IS A GRANT

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:26.471 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHEN PEOPLE PARTICIPATE

00:28:25.337 --> 00:28:27.873 region:rollup2
IN A CAR LAWYER PROGRAM

00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:29.341 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES IF TAKING A PIECE OF

00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:30.876 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT THAT WORKS JUST FINE

00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:32.377 region:rollup2
FOR THEM NOW. AND THEY HAVE TO

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:34.613 region:rollup2
SCRAP THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT

00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:35.147 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY PURCHASE A NEW PIECE

00:28:34.613 --> 00:28:35.581 region:rollup2
OF EQUIPMENT THAT'S LOWER

00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:36.882 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:38.350 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF COST

00:28:36.882 --> 00:28:39.818 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH IT WITH IT THE

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.986 region:rollup2
GRANTS TYPICALLY ONLY PAY FOR

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:42.654 region:rollup2
ABOUT HALF THE COST OF THE NEW

00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:45.023 region:rollup2
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:46.091 region:rollup2
AND SO. YEAH MORE MORE OFTEN

00:28:45.023 --> 00:28:47.292 region:rollup2
WERE WRITING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:49.261 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAYING WE'D LIKE TO

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:50.662 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE ABOUT THE UP FRONT

00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:52.831 region:rollup2
COST ARE JUST TOO MUCH SO WE

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:54.099 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS A. SENSIBLE WAY I

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:55.767 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THE PROGRAMS

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:56.401 region:rollup2
REACHING ALL THE FOLKS AS WAS

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.970 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:59.404 region:rollup2
THE VALLEY'S HOME TO TWENTY TO

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:07.179 region:rollup2
AND AND GET A MAJOR REDUCTIONS

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:09.147 region:rollup2
IN THOSE AREAS WE THINK THIS

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:11.984 region:rollup2
WILL BE VERY HELPFUL. SO WE ASK

00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:13.018 region:rollup2
