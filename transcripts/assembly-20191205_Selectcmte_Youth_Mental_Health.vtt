00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.943
LIFE. AND SO I GOT THIRTY

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.413
SECONDS LEFT AND NOW BUT.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.215
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME IS HOW

QUANTIFY IT'S GREAT TO TALK

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:05.885
THIS TALK OKAY WELL I'M GONNA

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.653
EMPOWER PEOPLE BUT HOW DOES IT.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.290
WORK HOW DO WE KNOW THAT. AS I

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:15.294
SAID OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO DO IS

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:21.100
WITH AMERITECH COMPANY. WE'RE

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:21.667
PARTNER WITH THAT NUMBER TO

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:22.234
COMPANY CALLED BRAIN BECAUSE

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:22.835
THAT'S BEEN DOING SOME WORK IN

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:24.236
CHIN. AND YOU KNOW THEY

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:24.837
BASICALLY. LIST THIS IS ARMEN

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:25.437
FOLK. MEASURE HOW THAT AFFECTS

00:13:25.504 --> 00:13:30.042
STUDENTS FOUND WAS EXERCISE

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:34.446
THAT THEY THEY THEMSELVES ARE

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:35.047
USED IN MY PROFESSORS DOUBLE

00:13:35.114 --> 00:13:36.649
STUDENT EMMA CAPABILITY. AND

00:13:36.715 --> 00:13:37.183
NOT ONLY THAT BUT IMPROVES

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:40.019
OVERALL. YOU KNOW WELL THAT IT

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:40.653
SO I FIGURED THAT SINCE WE HAVE

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:45.090
THIS THING THAT. TO WORK. AND

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:45.724
COMMUNITIES WITH THE RESOURCES

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.825
THAT ALLOW SEE. HOW IT WORKS

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:54.266
CAN USE THAT THE WAR. YOU CHECK

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:54.833
THE FABRIC OF THIS NATION IN

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.872
TERMS OF VIOLENCE. GET OUT

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:01.707
EVERYBODY MY NAME MY LIVELY

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.576
SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AGAIN FOR

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:06.612
THE CENTER TO PREVENT. RIGHT

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:09.481
ACTOR UNITY VIOLENCE INITIATIVE

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:10.082
SO I WANTED TO JUST A LITTLE

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:12.051
BIT OF SORT OF CONTACTS SETTING

00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:14.453
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FROM A

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.088
SORT OF. A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:16.655
I THINK IT'S A SURPRISE TO

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:18.057
ANYONE THAT GUN VIOLENCE OUT OF

00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:21.694
CONTROL IN THE STATE YOU CAN

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.261
OTHER HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:25.931
WORLD. ANYTHING PEOPLE ARE

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:26.532
PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THIS

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:29.802
DEMI. THESE ARE THE THIRD CAUSE

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:30.369
OF DEATH FOR GUN PEOPLE FOR

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:33.072
GOOD FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:33.706
UNITED STATES. WHICH I THINK IS

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:36.909
PRETTY STAGGERING AND AT THIS

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:40.045
POINT ALMOST A 100% OF OUR KIDS

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:40.679
IN PUBLIC SCHOOL ARE DISSIPATE.

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:41.814
IN ACT SHOOTER DRILLS WITH TO

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.185
BE EXTREMELY A LOT. IT ALSO

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.853
LOCKS. ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.487
FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE UNDER THE

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:52.091
AGE OF EIGHT SINCE YOUR TWO

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:52.758
THOUSAND AND THIS WHICH IS JUST

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:53.359
A STAGGERING NUMBER LIVES CUT

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:57.796
SHORT. WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH

00:14:57.863 --> 00:14:58.998
ANALYTICS. THE GUN. IN EXPOSURE

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:01.600
TO VIOLENCE LINKED TO DRAMA TO

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.636
PTSD AND TO. TERM AND LONG TERM

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:07.072
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:11.977
IMPACTS. SO WHAT HELPS EXPLAIN

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:12.611
THIS DEVASTATING EPIDEMIC WIDE

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:13.445
KNIGHTED STATES DIFFERENT FROM

00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:15.447
OTHER DEVELOPED HIGH INCOME

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:17.883
NATIONS IN THE WORLD. THE

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.386
ANSWER IS THE ACCESS TO

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:22.721
FIREARMS THAT JUST TODAY ARE

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:25.858
