ISSUES THAT WOULD SEEM MOST

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:47.412

DISTRICT THAT HAS GREAT WATER --

WE HAVE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL

00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:20.198
UTILITY DISTRICT WHICH GETS

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:21.132

MCCOLLUM THE RIVER --

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:27.205
AND OTHER PLACES WE ALSO HAVE --

00:28:27.272 --> 00:28:29.174
IN THIS SOUTHERN ALAMEDA COUNTY

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.809
WATER DISTRICT'S THE ALAMEDA

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:32.744
COUNTY WATER DISTRICT WE HAVE

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:34.946
THE MONEY TO TAKE BRACKISH WATER

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:37.549
AND TURN IT INTO CLEAN.

00:28:37.615 --> 00:28:39.551
DRINKABLE WATER.

00:28:39.617 --> 00:28:40.485
THERE ARE MANY PARTS OF THE

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:42.187
STATE THAT SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE

00:28:42.253 --> 00:28:43.421
MONEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:46.391
ORGANIZATION --

00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:50.862
WE CAN ALL AGREE ON MANY WAYS TO

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:52.964
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM GAPS SMALL

00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:54.499
DISTRICTS ABSORBED BY LARGER

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:57.168
ONES TO GIVE TECHNICAL SUPPORT.

00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:59.504
BUT IN THE END THE DIFFICULT

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:01.272
PART IS COMING UP WITH THE MONEY.

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:02.707
AND I WANT TO THANK THE CENTER

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:05.009
MINING FOR BRINGING FORWARD LAST

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:08.113
YEAR IS SB SIX TO THREE WHICH WE

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.147
PASSED.

00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:11.049
HOWEVER WHEN WE PASSED IT WE

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:13.918
LEFT OUT THE DIFFICULT PART

00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:14.519
WHICH IS WHERE THE MONEY COMES

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:15.253
FROM.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.221
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT

00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:18.256
ANSWER TO THAT IS RIGHT NOW BUT

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:19.791
THAT'S CLEARLY THE BIGGEST

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.793
QUESTION IT'S THE ONLY QUESTION

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.527
THAT.

00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:24.195
THAT REALLY IS UP THERE I DO

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:26.164
PLEDGE THAT IF WE CAN BRING

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.565
SOMETHING TO THE FLOOR.

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:29.434
I WILL SUPPORT IT I DON'T KNOW

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:31.269
WHAT THAT IS AND SO I'M MAKING A

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:33.838
COMMITMENT BEFORE IT COMES TO

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:34.105
THE FLOOR.

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:36.741
BUT I THINK THAT GETTING THAT

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:38.510
MONEY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:39.911
THING AND WHETHER IT'S FROM THE

00:29:39.978 --> 00:29:42.947
GENERAL FUND WHETHER IT'S A

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:45.350
SPECIAL TAX WHATEVER IT IS

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.352
THAT'S THE TOUGH PART THAT'S THE

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:47.986
PART.

00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:49.954
THAT SENATOR MINING IS GOING TO

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:51.256
HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD WITH

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:54.592
LEADERSHIP ON AND IT'S

00:29:54.659 --> 00:29:56.561
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND IF WE

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:57.929
DON'T DO IT WE ARE SHIRKING OUR

00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:59.364
RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.965

BUT DOES IT IS STYLE THE

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:29.460
CALIFORNIA CAN BE IN IN A WHAT

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:31.896
WHAT IS THE THEM UP AN IMPORTANT

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:33.131
THING WHICH IS NOT JUST BECAUSE

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:36.334
DEMóCRATAS LOCALS.

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:41.739
STUMBLED LEAST WE DISCUSS IT

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:43.308
WILL BE ANNOYING IS COMING IN A

00:30:43.374 --> 00:30:44.475

NO SIR MONNING HAS LED THE

00:30:53.718 --> 00:30:54.485
SENATE.

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:55.687
EFFORT TO ADDRESS A SAFE IN A

00:30:55.753 --> 00:30:56.654
FOUR WHEEL DRINKING WATER FOR A

00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:57.388
FEW YEARS NOW.

GOING TO HAVE HIM JOIN US ON THE

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:09.400
PANEL AFTER HE SPEAKS OF

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:10.602
CEREMONY FOR YOURS.

KNOWLEDGE THOSE LITTLE COMMON

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.988
THE FLIGHTS AFTER MY PRELIMINARY

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:32.890
TESTIMONY. FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP.

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:39.264
IN THESE EFFORTS AND FOR ALL

THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THEIR

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:46.571
FAMILIES.

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:47.839
I THINK THIS WILL BE YOUR

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:50.775
PROVIDING A VERY VALUABLE FORM

00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:52.744
AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR WHAT MAY

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.046
BE DIVERGENT VIEWPOINTS ON SOME

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:56.681
OF THE SOLUTIONS.

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:59.417
I THINK WE'LL HEAR A STRONG AND

00:31:59.484 --> 00:32:01.819
RESONANT AGREEMENT ON THE

00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:03.755
GRAVITY OF THE PROBLEM IN THE

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:08.192
CHALLENGE THAT NEEDS A SOLUTION --

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.661
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.

00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:11.829
EFFORTS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE

00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:13.898
BEEN SUPPORTED BY FORMER

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:16.134
GOVERNOR BROWN AND NOW THE

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.669
LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR NEW SOME.

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:19.304
HAS ALSO PUT THIS FRONT AND

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:20.772
CENTER -- IN

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:23.074
TERMS OF THE STATE'S BUDGET IN

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:26.277
TERMS OF PUBLIC AWARENESS --

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:28.579
AS WE MOVE FORWARD --

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:31.516
THE PROBLEM AND I'M GONNA RECITE

00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:34.185
THIS WHAT IS TOO MANY NOW ALMOST

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:34.952
A MANTRA.

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:38.056
BUT BEARS REPEATING BECAUSE OF

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:40.458
THE GRAVITY OF THIS ISSUE.

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:42.327
IS THE CHAIR MENTIONED CLOSE TO

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:44.395
ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS DO NOT

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.531
HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:48.166
AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER.

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:50.568
MOST CALIFORNIANS CAN TELL YOU

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.704
FLINT MICHIGAN IS KNOWN FOR LEAD

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.673
CONTAMINATION AFFECTING CHILDREN.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.774
THOSE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.376
FAMILIAR WITH THE CRISIS IN

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:02.046
FLINT MICHIGAN MANY DON'T KNOW.

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:03.748
THAT WE HAVE IN SOME WAYS MORE

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:05.550
GRAVE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF THE

00:33:05.616 --> 00:33:07.652
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AFFECTED.

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:09.320
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:12.156
AS WAS MENTIONED BY CHAIR BLOOM.

00:33:12.223 --> 00:33:13.858
WERE THE FIFTH STRONGEST ECONOMY

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:15.360
IN THE WORLD IF WE WERE

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:17.295
STANDALONE NATION.

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:20.531
AND THIS IS JUST AN UNACCEPTABLE

00:33:20.598 --> 00:33:22.066
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.935
WE HAVE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:26.871
HARD WORKING MEMBERS OF OUR

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:28.206
STATE AND OUR ECONOMY.

00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:28.840
WHO CAN'T DRINK THE WATER THAT

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:31.442
COMES OUT?

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.678
THEY CAN'T BASE WITH IT AND THEY

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:35.146
CAN'T COOK WITH CONTAMINATED

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:36.848
WATER.

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:38.783
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IS THESE

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.318
TEND TO BE PEOPLE LIVING IN

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:42.553
SMALL WATER DISTRICTS.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.589
AND IN POOR MARGINALIZED

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:47.024
COMMUNITIES SOME SAY IT'S JUST A

00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:48.726
PROBLEM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:50.228
THE SALINAS VALLEY.

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:52.130
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP.

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.464
EACH ONE OF THOSE RED STARS

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:55.099
ILLUSTRATES.

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:57.969
A CONTAMINATED WATER SYSTEM.

00:33:58.035 --> 00:34:00.004
IT IS NOT LIMITED. TO THE

00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:01.406
CENTRAL VALLEY OF THE SALINAS

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:03.508
VALLEY THOSE ARE AREAS OF HIGH

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:05.576
CONCENTRATION BUT VIRTUALLY

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:07.378
EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE OF

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:08.746
CALIFORNIA.

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.416
SUFFERS FROM A CONTAMINATED

00:34:11.482 --> 00:34:13.317
WATER SYSTEM.

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:16.053
THE TOXINS INCLUDE NITRATES

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.890
ARSENIC LEAD CHROMIUM SIX

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:24.128
URANIUM TCP AND THE LIST GOES ON

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:25.596
AND WHAT'S NOT KNOWN TO MANY IS

00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:27.832
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.233
TOXINS.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.202
ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING.

00:34:31.269 --> 00:34:32.937
THEY BECOME EVEN MORE PROMINENT

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:35.039
IN GROUND WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE

00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:36.941
STRESSED BY DROUGHT.

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:38.576
IN THERE FOR CREATES A NEXUS

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:41.112
ALSO WITH CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.381
INCREASE DROUGHT MORE STRESS ON

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:45.917
WATER SYSTEMS MORE LEACHING OF

00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:47.752
NATURAL CONTAMINANTS AND SOME

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:50.288
ARE CAUSED BY VARIOUS PRODUCERS

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:51.823
AND PRODUCTS.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:52.690
THEY ARE PART OF THIS

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:55.226
CONVERSATION IN PART OF THE

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.461
SOLUTION.

00:34:56.527 --> 00:34:58.396
AS WAS MENTIONED BOND FUNDS CAN

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:01.632
BE USED FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:03.801
FOR A WATER TREATMENT FACILITY.

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:05.670
BUT AS WE SEE IN ON THEIR WITH

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:07.738
BOND MONEY USED TO BUILD A

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:09.607
TREATMENT FACILITY [inaudible]

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:11.209
FOR ARSENIC.

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:13.578
THE SWITCH IS TURNED OFF BECAUSE

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:16.214
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.315
FOR THE OPERATIONS AND

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:19.617
MAINTENANCE ONE OF THE FEATURES

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:21.285
OF OUR LEGISLATION AND OF THE

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:22.420
GOVERNOR'S.

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:24.622
NOW SUBMISSION TO THE BUDGET.

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:27.792
IS THE VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT.

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:30.094
OF RAISING A SAFE CLEAN DRINKING

00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:32.964
WATER FUND THAT CAN BE ACCESSED

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.465
NOT JUST FOR CAPITAL

00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:35.800
IMPROVEMENTS ARE LINKING WATER

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:36.934
SYSTEMS.

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:38.769
BUT FOR THE OPERATIONS AND

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:40.171
MAINTENANCE A SMALL WATER

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:41.939
DISTRICT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF

00:35:42.006 --> 00:35:45.309
RESIDENTS TWO HUNDRED THREE

00:35:45.376 --> 00:35:45.910
HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED YOU CAN'T

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:48.679
RAISE THE WATER RATE HIGH ENOUGH.

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:50.381
OR OF TO BE AFFORDABLE. TO

00:35:50.448 --> 00:35:52.683
PROVIDE THE ONGOING OPERATIONS

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.886
AND MAINTENANCE.

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:56.487
SO WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:56.787
[inaudible]

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.289
THE SOLUTIONS.

00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:01.125
R. TO CREATE A PREDICTABLE AND

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:03.561
RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE. TO

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:05.530
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.

00:36:05.596 --> 00:36:09.033
IN THE SOLUTION IS WITHIN REACH.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.135
IT'S THE SCIENCES THERE THE

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:13.538
TECHNOLOGY IS THERE THE

00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:15.306
SOLUTIONS EXIST.

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:17.441
THEY MAY BE CONNECTING.

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.343
A CONTAMINATED WATER SYSTEM ARE

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.112
SMALL DISTRICT TO A LARGER

00:36:21.178 --> 00:36:23.748
SYSTEM WITHIN A REASONABLE SPACE.

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:25.983
THAT.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.085
CAN TRANSPORT CLEAN SAFE

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:29.720
DRINKING WATER.

00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:31.956
YET MAYBE CONTRACTS CONSTRUCTION

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.457
OF A TREATMENT FACILITY.

00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:35.626
AND FOR ALL IT WILL INVOLVE SOME

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:37.929
NEED FOR ONGOING OPERATIONS AND

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:38.963
MAINTENANCE.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.264
AND IN OUR A MERCHANT SEE

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:42.466
CIRCUMSTANCE AND WE ARE LIVING

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:44.869
IN AN EMERGENCY IF YOU'RE ONE OF

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.470
THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T DRINK.

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.506
THE WATER THAT MANY ARE PAYING

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:50.007
FOR BUT CAN'T DRINK.

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:53.578
BOTTLED WATER IS AN EMERGENCY.

00:36:53.644 --> 00:36:56.547
SOLUTION WE DON'T WANT BOTTLED

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:58.215
WATER TO BE THE SOLUTION.

00:36:58.282 --> 00:37:00.051
BUT AS WE TRANSITION THESE

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:01.852
SYSTEMS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:03.754
WATER BOTTLED WATER SHOULD BE

00:37:03.821 --> 00:37:05.056
MADE AVAILABLE AS WELL BECAUSE

00:37:05.122 --> 00:37:07.892
MANY FAMILIES ARE PAYING FORTY

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:10.261
TO FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK. FOR

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:12.229
BOTTLED WATER ON TOP OF PAYING A

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.098
WATER BILL FOR WATER THAT THEY

00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:16.300
CAN ONLY USE MAYBE TO IRRIGATE

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:17.268
THEIR YARD.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:19.370
BUT NOT TO DRINK.

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:21.672
OR BAY TH OR COOK WITH.

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:22.907
SO WHAT'S THE PATH TO THIS

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:24.942
SOLUTION.

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.944
WE HAVE A WORKING GROUP OF OVER

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:28.779
SEVENTY ORGANIZATIONS.

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:30.615
INCLUDING AGRICULTURAL

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:32.917
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:35.553
WATER DISTRICTS POLITICAL BODIES

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.755
AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:40.358
THE AGRICULTURAL PARTICIPANTS IN

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:41.459
THIS EFFORT.

00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:43.160
AGRICULTURE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:45.329
IT'S NOT MONOLITHIC IN THE STATE

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:47.164
OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DAIRY

00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:49.400
PRODUCERS WHO WANT TO BE PART OF

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.402
THE SOLUTION WE HAVE CONTAINS

00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:52.436
CATTLE.

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:53.704
CATTLE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:55.740
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WANT TO

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:57.274
BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.

00:37:57.341 --> 00:37:57.875
AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF CROP

00:37:57.942 --> 00:38:01.779
PRODUCERS SPECIALTY CROPS TO ROW

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:03.614

TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.888
AND THEN THERE'S THE RATE PAYER

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:11.922
PIECE.

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:12.890
AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GONNA

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.392
HAVE SOME I THINK IMPORTANT

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:16.127
CONVERSATION TODAY.

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:17.561
SOME OF SAID WELL LET'S JUST

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:19.230
ESTABLISH A TRUST FUND IN USE

00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:21.899

LAST YEAR AND WE'VE INTRODUCED

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:25.536
SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED THIS

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:26.904
YEAR.

00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:28.773
CHAIR GARCIA IS A CO AUTHOR ON

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:30.808
THAT -- IT'S

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:32.343
YOU MIGHT CALL A SPOT BILL AT

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.878

00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:34.945
OUT.

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:36.747
BUT WE BELIEVE THE RATE PAYER

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:40.351
PIECE IS THE CRITICAL COMPONENT.

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:42.253
TO CREATING A GUARANTEED AND

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:45.356
PREDICTABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING.

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:47.358
ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.293
WATER IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND IT'S

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.896
A PUBLIC HEALTH IMPERATIVE.

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:54.131
IN TWENTY TWELVE THEN ASSEMBLY

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:57.768

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.574
THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ACCESS TO

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.209
CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER.

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:07.678
SO WE'VE ESTABLISHED IN LAW A

00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:09.814
HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.049
BUT WE HAVEN'T MADE GOOD.

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:13.484
ON THAT LEGAL RIGHT THAT WE'VE

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:16.253
CREATED.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.089
IN OUR PASSED LEGISLATION WE

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:20.958
PROPOSE PROPOSED A COMBINED FEE

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:23.828
ON CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:26.230
IN A RATE PAYER DE MINIMUS

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:28.466

FEDERAL POVERTY LINE.

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:35.372
UNDERSTANDABLY MANY WATER

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:37.208
DISTRICTS DO NOT SUPPORT A

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:38.843
REPAIR CONTRIBUTION AS PART OF

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:42.480
THE SOLUTION.

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:45.049
BUT EVEN WHEN IT IS LESS THAN

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:47.017
ONE DOLLAR PER MONTH LESS THAN A

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:49.520
CUP OF COFFEE.

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.889
LESS THAN A CANDY BAR WE CALL IT

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:53.791
A DE MINIMUS FEE.

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:56.660
BECAUSE BY ALL JOINING HANDS BY

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.028

00:39:58.095 --> 00:40:00.931
PROBLEM OF ALL CALIFORNIANS.

00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:02.433
WE ALL SHOULDER PART OF THEIR

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.168

SOLUTION.

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:08.839
WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:10.107
WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:11.208
RIGHTS.

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:12.543
AND IT REQUIRES ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.147
TO STEP UP. TO HOLD HANDS AND TO

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:19.984

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.545
THAT FAR TOO MANY.

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:50.080
HAVE WAITED FOR FAR TOO LONG TO

WE CAN SOLVE IT THIS YEAR.

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:23.614
THE ONLY THING LACKING IS THE

POLITICAL WILL.

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:28.152

ABOUT POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES.

HUNDRED FORTY MILLION A YEAR.

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:38.155
OKAY AGRICULTURE WOULD

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:40.157
CONTRIBUTE ABOUT. THIRTY TO

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.458
FORTY MILLION OF THAT.

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:42.660
IN THE REST WOULD BE FROM THE

RATE PAYER FEENEY THAT

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.964
APPORTIONMENT IS BASED ON THE

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.165
SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS.

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.935
OF THE DEGREE OF CONTAMINATION

00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:52.469
BE TRACED TO AGRICULTURAL

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:55.572
POLLUTANTS ABOUT 30%.

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:57.841
AND ABOUT 70% OR THE NATURAL

00:42:57.908 --> 00:42:59.877
OCCURRING POLLUTANTS THAT'S

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:01.779
WHERE WE PROPOSE TO USE A RATE

00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:03.447
PAYER FEE.

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:05.282
AGAIN AT NINE TO GATHER SO SEVEN

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.084
HUNDRED FORTY MILLION A YEAR

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:08.252
ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION.

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:09.787
DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.789
ENOUGH TO RUN ALL THE WATER

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:13.290
TREATMENT PLANTS ARE GOING TO BE

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:15.359
NECESSARY TO EVEN PUT A DENT IN

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:16.427
THIS.

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:18.595
IT'S A FAIR QUESTION --

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:20.197
WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE ENOUGH AND

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:23.434
IT'S BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.169
WHERE THESE POLLUTED.

00:43:25.235 --> 00:43:27.471
CONTAMINATED DISTRICTS ARE

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:29.340
PROXIMITY TO CLEAN DRINKING

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.808
WATER --

00:43:30.874 --> 00:43:32.409
PART OF THE MONEY IN THE FIRST

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:35.346
YEARS WOULD BE USED TO FURTHER

00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:36.714
PRIORITIZE.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.482
IT DOES PRIORITIZE FOR

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:39.883
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.552
THESE ARE COMMUNITIES MANY OF

00:43:41.618 --> 00:43:42.553
WHOM.

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:43.754
ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR STATE

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:46.156
WIDE ECONOMY WORKING IN THE

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:47.324
FIELDS --

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:49.827
AND CONTRIBUTING TO THOSE IN

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.695
URBAN AREAS AS WELL MAY I ASK

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:53.097
THE QUESTION BECAUSE THE IF WE

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:54.732
LOOK AT WHAT THE WATER BOARD

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.300
ESTIMATED --

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:58.235
FROM --

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:58.869
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THEY DISPERSED

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:00.604
OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:01.505
MILLION --

00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:03.073
FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.442
WATER SYSTEMS AND I MEAN WHAT

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:06.910
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:09.747
PROPOSAL SIR IS --

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:12.950
NOT EVEN HALF OF THAT CLEAR FINE

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:15.119
SO I'M IN AND AND WITH THAT DO

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:16.887
WE HAVE A COST ON HOW MUCH IT.

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:19.156
FOR OPERATION COST ON HOW MUCH

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:20.557
IT COSTS TO RUN. ONE OF THE

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:23.427
SYSTEMS OF VIRTUE OF THIS SAFE

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:24.661
CLEAN DRINKING WATER FIND.

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:28.332
AND THE PERPETUAL SOURCE OF OF

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.367
FINDING IT CAN BE USED FOR

00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:31.935
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE WE

00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:33.871
CAN COMPLEMENT THAT WITH

00:44:33.937 --> 00:44:35.339
EXISTING BOND.

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:38.409
MONIES FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS --

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:39.977
SOME OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:42.312
BUT WE CAN'T USE BOND MONEY FOR

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:44.615
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SO

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:45.416
THIS.

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:47.851
FIND HELP SUPPLEMENT WHAT WE

00:44:47.918 --> 00:44:49.987
ALREADY HAVE FROM FOR CAPITAL

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:51.455
IMPROVEMENTS SO IT'S NOT THE

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.390
ONLY MONEY AVAILABLE FOR WATER

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:54.324
IMPROVEMENT.

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.994
BUT IT SPECIALLY AVAILABLE FOR

CALIFORNIANS ENJOY ACCESS TO

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:03.180
CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER --

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:05.148
THINKS TOO MANY OF OUR WATER

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:06.950
UTILITIES ACROSS THE STATE --

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:08.619
WHEN DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:10.887
ARISE IN IN COMMUNITIES?

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:12.656
WHERE MOST OF US LIVE?

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.658

I KNOW I'VE ONLY LIVED IN

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:21.832
COMMUNITIES --

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:23.400
WHERE I TAKE FOR GRANTED THE

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:24.635
FACT THAT WE HAVE CLEAN SAFE

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:25.802
DRINKING WATER --

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.437
BUT I'VE USED AS YOU'VE HEARD IN

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:29.973
YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A REALITY.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.510
FOR MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE.

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.112
I HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:37.681
AND I COULDN'T IMAGINE LIVING IN

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.016
A HOME WHERE.

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:42.052
SHE HAD TO LEARN I ACTUALLY NOT

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:43.287
TO DRINK THE WATER.

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:44.755
ORDERED ACTUALLY IS IN SOME

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:46.657
CASES TOUCH OBEYED IN THE WATER --

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:47.991
THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE TAPS

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:49.526
BUT THAT'S A REALITY FOR PEOPLE

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:50.894
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:52.029
YOU KNOW TONIGHT UPWARDS OF A

00:48:52.095 --> 00:48:53.330
MILLION PEOPLE WILL LEAVE THEIR

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:55.198
JOBS -- PICK

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:57.167
UP THEIR KIDS AND GO HOME --

00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.802
TO PLACES WHERE THEY LIVE ARE

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:00.537
WHERE THEY CAN'T DRINK THE WATER

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.239
THE WATER IS ACTUALLY GOING. TO

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:03.240
TO IT TO MAKE THEM SO --

00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:04.875
AND THEIR FAMILIES SEC AND I

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:06.877
THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S WIDELY

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:09.680
ACKNOWLEDGED AND THAT'S BEYOND

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:10.814
DEBATE --

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:11.948
BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING JUST THE

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:13.717
SORT OF THE HUMAN DIMENSION OF

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:16.086
THE PROBLEM --

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:17.521
SO HERE ARE THE FACTS AS WE

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:18.989
UNDERSTAND THEM --

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:19.723
MOCHA --

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:20.857
MANY LOCAL WATER SYSTEMS IN THE

00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:22.559
STATE PARTICULARLY THE THOSE IN

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:24.127
SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:25.529
CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO PROVIDE

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:28.365
SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER OUT TO

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:29.933
THE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS --

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.336
OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN

00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:33.904
OVER THREE HUNDRED PUBLIC WATER

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.272
SYSTEMS THAT ARE REGULATED BY

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:36.807
THE STATE --

00:49:36.873 --> 00:49:38.041
FAILED TO PROVIDE --

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:40.077
OR OR EXPERIENCE TOXIC WATER

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:41.511
COMING FROM --

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:43.613
THEIR WATER AGENCIES AND BELIEVE

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.815
IT OR NOT THESE FOLKS ACTUALLY

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:47.217
PAY THEIR WATER BILLS OFFER

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:48.785
WATER THAT THEY CAN'T DRINK --

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:50.787
THEN THERE ARE ANOTHER SET OF

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:52.222
FOLKS THAT GET THEIR WATER FROM

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:54.991
WHAT ARE CALLED STATE SMALLS OR

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.360
A STATE.

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:58.028
SMALL DRINKING WATER AGENCIES

00:49:58.095 --> 00:49:58.495
WITH LESS THAN FIFTEEN

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:00.063
CONNECTIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.299
REGULATED BY THE STATE AND THEN

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.367
OF COURSE FOCUS ON DOMESTIC

00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:03.867
WELLS.

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:05.635
AT TWO SO WHEN WE USE THIS

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:07.938
ESTIMATE OF UPWARDS OF A MILLION.

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:09.773
CALIFORNIANS SUFFER FROM TOXIC

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.308
WATER -- WE

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.076
HAVE A VERY PRECISE ESTIMATE.

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:16.513
OF THOSE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES --

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.115
BOARD A LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:19.383
STATE'S MALLS AND THE DOMESTIC

00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:20.951
WELLS.

00:50:21.017 --> 00:50:22.819
I IN A SENATOR MINING SAID --

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:24.488
IN THESE COMMUNITIES.

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:26.089
FOLKS ARE DRINKING OR OR HAVE

00:50:26.156 --> 00:50:27.157
WATER IN THEIR HOMES THAT ARE

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:28.892
CONTAMINATED BY A RANGE OF

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:32.562
SUBSTANCES NITRATES ARSENIC --

00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:34.431
ACCIDENT ACTS AVAILING CHROMIUM

00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:36.333
OR CHROME --

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.634
SIX WE PROBABLY ALL KNOW THESE

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.069
CONTAMINANTS --

00:50:39.136 --> 00:50:39.436
CAN.

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:42.305
CONTAIN CARCINOGENS AND OTHER

00:50:42.372 --> 00:50:44.241
SEVERELY DAMAGING COMPOUNDS THAT

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:45.542
BECAUSE BOTH CHRONIC HEALTH

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:46.610
PROBLEMS AND HAVE BEEN

00:50:46.676 --> 00:50:48.979
DEMONSTRATED TO SHORTEN LIFE

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.013
SPANS.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.081
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN CENTRAL

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:52.182
COAST REGIONS --

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:53.984
WHERE MORE THAN 90% OF

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.752
COMMUNITIES DEPEND ON GROUND

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:57.320
WATER IS AN AREA THAT'S

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:58.722
OBVIOUSLY HARD HIT BY THIS

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:00.357
CRISIS?

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:00.924
MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:02.459
PEOPLE -- IN

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:04.027
THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALONE LACK

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:06.263
ACCESS TO A CONSISTENT SOURCE OF

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:07.631
SAFE AND AFFORDABLE WATER.

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:08.765
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:10.767
CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.402
RURAL PROBLEM --

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:14.104
IN THE URBAN COMMUNITIES IN OUR

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:15.505
STATE AND POCKETS OF OUR STATE

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:18.442
ALSO FACE DRINKING WATER THREATS --

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:19.743
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE READ RECENT

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:23.280
I PRESSED WATER AGENCIES IN LOS

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:25.248
ANGELES IN THE LOS ANGELES BASIN

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.683
AUDIT OF HOW DRINKING WATER

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:27.918
PROBLEMS --

00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:29.553
THAT THEY'VE HAD DIFFICULTY

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:30.954
ADDRESSING BECAUSE OF THE SMALL

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:32.255
AYE IMPOVERISHED NATURE OF THEIR

00:51:32.322 --> 00:51:33.790
COMMUNITIES.

00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:36.026
THIS FUND WOULD ADDRESS THAT.

00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:36.726
SENATOR MINING MENTION THE

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:38.462
DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN FLINT

00:51:38.528 --> 00:51:40.997
IN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE ALL

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.632
REMEMBER THAT WHERE FAIRLY

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:44.868
SUDDENLY AYE LAD LEACHED FROM

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.403
PIPES --

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.738
INTO FLINT RESIDENTS WATER --

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:50.807
AS A RESULT OF FLINT CHANGING

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:52.909
ITS WATER SUPPLY AND NOT ADDING

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:54.478
THE RIGHT ANTI CORROSION

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.012
CHEMICALS --

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:58.114
AND WHAT RESULTED WAS --

00:51:58.181 --> 00:51:58.882
TOXIC LEVELS OF LEAD IN THE

00:51:58.949 --> 00:51:59.583
WATER.

00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:00.951
I THINK WHAT'S REMARKABLE IN THE

00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:03.353
CONTEXT OF THIS DISCUSSION IS

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.022
TODAY IN CALIFORNIA TEN TIMES

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:07.757
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE --

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:09.359
COMPARED TO FRIENDS POPULATION

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:11.761
ACTUALLY OP SUFFER FROM TOXIC

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:13.563
WATER AND AGAIN THAT'S REALLY

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:15.298
BEYOND DEBATE --

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:17.601
AT THIS POINT --

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.002
I THINK ALSO CENTER MINING --

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:20.170
DEMONSTRATED A LOT OF

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:21.404
CALIFORNIANS AREN'T AWARE OF

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:22.672
THIS CRISIS --

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.641
I KNOW I I SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:26.009
ACROSS THE STATE AND A LOT OF

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:27.310
FOLKS THAT --

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:28.211
YOU WOULD THINK ON'T WOULD

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:29.312
UNDERSTAND --

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:30.347
SITUATION LIKE THIS ACTUALLY

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:32.249
DON'T HAVE AWARENESS --

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:34.284
OF JUST THE SCOPE OF THE CRISIS --

00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:36.586
IN MY PRIOR FROM MY PRIOR ROLE

00:52:36.653 --> 00:52:38.021
WATER FOUNDATION --

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:39.656
WHICH WORKED ON THIS ISSUE I

00:52:39.723 --> 00:52:41.491
KNOW THAT PUBLIC NONPARTISAN

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:43.627
POLLING HAS SHOWN ON THAT MORE

00:52:43.693 --> 00:52:44.728
IS KNOWN IN THE STATE.

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:47.130
TODAY ABOUT FLINT MICHIGAN THAN

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:50.400
ARE THEIR OWN CHALLENGES HERE --

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:53.036
SPALLING THAT WAS DONE IN --

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:53.670
TWENTY SIXTEEN DEMONSTRATED THE

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.071
STATE RESIDENTS ARE READY TO

00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:56.273
STEP UP AND HELP SOLVE THIS

00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:57.440
CRISIS --

00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:58.642
AND THAT PARTICULAR --

00:52:58.708 --> 00:53:00.343
POLLING SUGGESTED --

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.511
UPWARDS OF TWO THIRDS OF

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:02.746
CALIFORNIANS --

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:04.047
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SUPPORTED A

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:05.415
SURCHARGE OF UP TO TWO DOLLARS

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:08.018
PER MONTH ON THEIR WATER BILLS I

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.886
TO ENSURE CLEAN AND SAFE

00:53:09.953 --> 00:53:10.353
DRINKING WATER FOR ALL

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.555
CALIFORNIANS.

00:53:11.621 --> 00:53:13.056
SO AS MENTIONED IN THE

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:14.624
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:15.926
SOLUTIONS TO THIS CRISIS

00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:17.394
INVOLVES SEVERAL IMPORTANT

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.663
ACTIONS --

00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:21.665
ONE OF FUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:22.966
UPGRADES IN LOCAL WATER

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.402
DISTRICTS BOND FUNDING --

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:26.536
INCLUDING SOME BOND FUNDING I

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:27.637
TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT IS

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:29.039
IMPORTANT TOWARDS PROVIDING

00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:32.042
THOSE ONE TIME CAPITAL UPGRADES.

00:53:32.108 --> 00:53:33.643
ALSO ANOTHER IMPORTANT ACTION IS

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.945
BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THESE

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.580
LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS A TREAT

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:37.314
POLLUTION AND PROVIDE CLEAN

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:37.981
WATER.

00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:39.149
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TECHNICAL

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.650
ASSISTANCE RESOURCES AVAILABLE

00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:42.352
TO THE SMALL COMMUNITIES.

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:44.054
ANOTHER IMPORTANT ACTION IS

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.822
CONSOLIDATING OR REGIONAL ISING

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:47.190
SMALL SYSTEMS --

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:48.625
WHERE THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT ABLE TO

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:49.626
PROVIDE WATER?

00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:51.161
AND YOUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP

00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.896
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE HAS

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:54.831
INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TOOLS --

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:55.732
THAT THE WATER BAT BOARD HAS TO

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:58.702
INCUR OUR NATION'S OF FAILING

00:53:58.768 --> 00:54:00.870
SYSTEMS THAT'S CLEARLY PART OF

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:01.905
THE SOLUTION --

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.607
IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS AS LEAD

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:05.508
IN EACH OF THESE AREAS --

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:07.077
AS NOTED THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

00:54:07.143 --> 00:54:08.578
REMAINING CHALLENGE IS THE LACK

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:09.980
OF A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR

00:54:10.046 --> 00:54:11.448
LONG TERM OPERATION AND

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:12.282
MAINTENANCE FOR DRINKING WATER

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:13.683
SYSTEMS.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.485
WHILE BOND FUNDS PROVIDE THAT

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:17.120
IMPORTANT ONE TIME CAPITAL --

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:18.521
UPGRADE --

00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:20.256
WHAT WE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE AS

00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:21.591
IF THERE'S NOT RESOURCES TO

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:23.159
ACTUALLY OPERATE THAT --

00:54:23.226 --> 00:54:25.528
THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:26.896
TECHNOLOGY --

00:54:26.963 --> 00:54:29.132
THEN THERE'S THERE'S NO SUCH

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:29.733
THING AS CLEAN WATER IN THESE

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:31.034
COMMUNITIES AND THERE ARE

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:32.569
CERTAIN CAUTIONARY TALES WHERE

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:34.671
THE STATE PROVIDED INITIAL ONE

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:36.106
TIME FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:37.073
UPGRADES.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.142
ON THAT ULTIMATELY GOT SHUDDERED

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:39.743
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF ON GOING

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:41.444
FUNDING.

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.712
BOB CLEARLY GOVERNOR KNEW SOME

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:43.847
HAS MADE AFFORDABLE SAFE

00:54:43.913 --> 00:54:45.348
DRINKING WATER PRIORITY FOR THIS

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:47.017
ADMINISTRATION --

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.385
WE SHARE THE VIEW THAT IN THE

00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:51.321
STATE AS AT AS RICH AND RESOURCE

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:52.989
WEALTHIEST CALIFORNIA --

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:55.225
THE FACT THAT UP LARGE PORTION

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:57.694
OF OUR RESIDENTS I CAN'T DEPEND

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:59.095
ON CLEAN AND SAFE WATER --

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:00.764
IS A SHAMEFUL REALITY THAT WE

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:01.898
NEED TO ADDRESS --

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:03.233
AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE CAN

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:04.534
ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.469
THAT'S BEYOND DEBATE BUT NOW WE

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:07.904
ACTUALLY HAVE TO COMMIT

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.139
OURSELVES TO A SOLUTION.

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:10.240
THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET

00:55:10.306 --> 00:55:11.608
CONTAINS SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:12.609
PROPOSALS --

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:15.945
ON THIS TOPIC NUMBER --

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:16.980
ONE IT APPROPRIATE IT'S OR

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:19.549
PROPOSES APPROPRIATE EIGHT

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:21.418
MILLION DOLLARS FROM PROPERTY

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:24.087
PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT THE BOND

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.488
MEASURE THE PASSED IN JUNE --

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:26.790
TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.525
GRANTS AND LOANS TO PUBLIC WATER

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.260
SYSTEMS I IN DISADVANTAGED

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:31.528
COMMUNITIES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:34.064
IMPROVEMENTS.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.332
IT PROPOSES TEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:39.102
IN EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLIES --

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.704
FOR FROM THE GENERAL FUND --

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.706
TO ADDRESS THESE EMERGENCIES ARE

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:43.339
WHERE.

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:44.607
THROUGH THE PROVISION OF BOTTLED

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:46.843
WATER WATER TANKS ETCETERA.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.813
ALMOST LIKE EMERGENCY ROOM CARE --

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.347
THAT'S NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:52.182
BUT IT'S ADDRESSING THAT THE

00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:54.017
ACUTE LACK OF A CLEAN AND SAFE

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:54.984
WATER.

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.720
UP ANOTHER TEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.688
PROPOSED IN THE GENERAL FUND --

00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:00.156
FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:01.858
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE --

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:02.692
IN MANY OF THESE SMALL

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:03.993
COMMUNITIES THEY SIMPLY CAN'T

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.428
AFFORD FULL TIME TECHNICAL

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:06.496
EXPERTS.

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:08.198
ON SO COMMUNITIES I VISITED --

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:10.400
THEY CAN ACTUALLY CONTRACT FOR A

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:12.102
TECHNICAL EXPERT TO COME IN AND

00:56:12.168 --> 00:56:14.003
HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.805
TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED TO CLEAN

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:18.608
THE WATER AND ACTUALLY --

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:21.044
THEN OPERATE THAT TECHNOLOGY

00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:22.612
NOTE THAT BOTH I'M TEN MILLION

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.781
FOR EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLIES AND

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:25.281
TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE

00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:26.382
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE --

00:56:26.449 --> 00:56:28.952
WERE CONTAINED IN AB --

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:30.019
SEVENTY TWO THAT THE ASSEMBLY

00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:31.921
ACTED UPON LAST WEEK --

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:33.957
SO THAT THOSE FUNDS HAT TWENTY

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:34.591
MILLION DOLLARS FOR MURDERS HE

00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:35.992
WATER SUPPLIES TECHNICAL

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:36.593
ASSISTANCE MOVING THROUGH THE

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:37.427
PROCESS.

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:39.229
ARE RECOGNIZING THE EMERGENCY

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:41.131
NEED FOR THAT FUNDING --

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:41.931
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:43.700
ALSO INCLUDES ALMOST FIVE

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:45.268
MILLION DOLLARS ON A ONE TIME

00:56:45.335 --> 00:56:46.503
BASIS TO BOTH THE STATE WATER

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:48.138
BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:49.973
AND AGRICULTURE. TO TAKE INITIAL

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:51.708
STEPS TO SET UP THIS CLEAN AND

00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:53.743
SAFE DRINKING WATER FUND --

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.411
AND SPECIFICALLY --

00:56:55.478 --> 00:56:56.880
TO IMPLEMENT THAT FEE COLLECTION

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:57.847
SYSTEMS.

00:56:57.914 --> 00:57:00.049
ADOPT AN ANNUAL IMPLEMENTATION --

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:02.919
PLAN AND DEVELOP A MAP OF HIGH

00:57:02.986 --> 00:57:05.722
RISK AQUIFER'S --

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:06.356
THAT ARE USED TO DRINKING WATER

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:07.957
SOURCES --

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:09.559
AND THEN OF COURSE YOU GOVERNOR

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SAFE AND

00:57:13.696 --> 00:57:15.198
AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND --

00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:16.833
RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR ON

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.035
GOING FUNDING --

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:21.738
TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS --

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.173
THIS PROPOSAL AS IT'S WRITTEN

00:57:23.239 --> 00:57:24.440
IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:27.343
FRAMEWORK OF SB --

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:27.944
SIX TWENTY THREE THAT SENATOR

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:29.179
MINING INTRODUCED --

00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:30.980
IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:32.382
EIGHTEEN LEGISLATIVE SESSION.

00:57:32.448 --> 00:57:33.716
AND I INVITE YOU IF YOU WANT TO

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:35.885

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:38.054
FUND WORKS OUR TASK OF SPECIFIC

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:40.023
QUESTIONS ARE I AS I UNDERSTAND

00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:41.491
IT ACTUALLY THAT.

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:42.959
THE FUND --

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:45.361
IS FAIRLY FLEXIBLE IN THE SENSE

00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:47.664
THAT IF THE FUNDS ARE NOT NEEDED

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.165
OVERTIME --

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:50.500
THE AMOUNT OF FEE COLLECTION

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:53.503
WOULD REDUCE AND THE FUND --

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:54.037
IT HAS PROTECTIONS AROUND

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:58.007
AMASSING TOO MUCH REVENUE --

00:57:58.074 --> 00:57:59.242
THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET OUT TO

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:00.009
THE FIELD --

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:02.078
AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SO I

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:03.413
THINK SENATOR MINING --

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:06.149
AND OTHERS HAVE TAKEN GREAT CARE --

00:58:06.216 --> 00:58:07.050
TO CREATE A FUND THAT

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.685
SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON ADDRESSING

00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:09.452
THE PROBLEM BUT AVOIDS

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.421
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:12.856
OTHER STATE FUNDS HAVE IN THE

00:58:12.922 --> 00:58:14.891

CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER.

00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:20.490
AND THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP IN

00:59:20.556 --> 00:59:22.392
PLACE TO SEE IT ADDRESSED.

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:24.060
I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY AND

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:25.094
WE'VE HEARD IT SEVERAL TIMES

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:25.728
TODAY ALREADY.

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:27.096
THAT.

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.431
THERE IS A CONSENSUS OUT THERE

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:29.198
AND THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING

00:59:29.265 --> 00:59:30.733
SENSE OF AGREEMENT THAT WE CAN

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:31.768
NO LONGER ACCEPT THAT THE

00:59:31.834 --> 00:59:33.002
WEALTHIEST STATE AND THE

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:34.604
WEALTHIEST NATION IN THE WORLD.

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:35.939
WE HAVE COMMUNITIES FAMILIES AND

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:38.241
CHILDREN THEY GO WITHOUT ACCESS

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:38.808
THE CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:40.009
WATER.

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:41.311
AND YET DESPITE THAT SENSE OF

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:42.979
AGREEMENT CANDIDLY I HEAR

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:44.213
CRITICISM THE PURSUING A CLEAN

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.682
SAFE DRINKING WATER FUND IS TOO

00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:46.916
PREMATURE.

00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:48.685
THAT STATE AGENCIES NEED ONLY DO

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:50.253
MORE WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.521
OR THAT WE NEED TO FURTHER STUDY

00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:53.256
OR UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM BEFORE

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:54.857
PURSUING FUNDS.

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:55.625
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:56.159
REMEMBER THAT THE GENERAL

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:58.194
PROPOSAL TO CREATE A STABLE

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.362
SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT CAN BE

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.296
SPENT ON THE OPERATIONS

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:01.631

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:04.467
SYSTEMS.

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.069
IS IN A REQUEST OF FIRST RESORT.

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.570
NOR IS IT AWAY TO INDEFINITELY

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.772
PROP UP UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:12.008
INSTEAD THE FUND IS THE KEYSTONE

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.676
TO A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THIS

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.411
STATE HAS STOP LEE PIECE

THERE'S A COMPREHENSIVE

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:20.383
PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSE TO

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.751
COMMUNITIES WITHOUT ACCESS TO

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.419
CLEAN DRINKING WATER AT HAND.

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:24.988

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:29.886
THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO GRANTED

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:30.787
THE BOARD MANDATORY

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:31.888
CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITIES OVER

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:33.956
FAILING SYSTEMS GREATER ABILITY

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.458
TO DENY THE PERMITTING OF NEW

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.093
UNSUSTAINABLE WATER SYSTEMS.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.227
ALONG WITH THE ABILITY TO

APPOINT ADMINISTRATORS TO

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:40.930
FAILING SYSTEMS.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.632
IN FACT OVER THE LAST YEARS WE

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:44.200
HAVE BROUGHT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:45.201
SYSTEMS REGULATED BY THE STATE

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:47.203
WATER BOARD BACK INTO COMPLIANCE.

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:49.572
LEAVING STILL TWO HUNDRED AND

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:50.706
SIXTY FOUR TO BE ADDRESSED AND

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:53.709
HALF IS IS NOT A SUCCESS HALF IS

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.378
NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE TO SUCCESS.

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.747
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT OF THESE

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:58.347
TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR SYSTEMS

01:01:58.414 --> 01:01:59.348
NOT CURRENTLY MEETING DRINKING

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.217
WATER STANDARDS THERE ARE STILL

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.385
MORE SYSTEMS THAT ARE EITHER

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:05.088
CYCLING IN OUT OF COMPLIANCE OR

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:05.855
ONE HARDSHIP AWAY FROM MEETING

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:06.589
NEWS.

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:09.158
NEW STANDARDS OR MEETING CURRENT

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:09.392
STATE.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.093
STANDARDS.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.527
WHILE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS OUT

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.096
OF COMPLIANCE AS ONE INDICATOR

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:14.797
AND WORKING TO BRING THE NUMBER

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:16.232
ZERO IS IMPORTANT WE KNOW THAT

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:16.966
IT'S A NUMBER THAT DOESN'T

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.367
REFLECT THE THOUSANDS OF SYSTEMS

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:19.802
WE ESTIMATE TO EXIST THAT ARE

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.404
EITHER TOO SMALL TO BE REGULATED

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:22.405
BY THE STATE BOARD.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:25.074
OR ARE HOUSEHOLDS DEPENDENT ON

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.442
DOMESTIC WELLS.

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.076
ON THAT ISSUE WE'RE GLAD WE'VE

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:28.144
TO RECEIVE FUNDING FOR THE

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:29.645
LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST SESSION

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.013
TO COMPLETE A NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.615
ATTEMPTS TO QUANTIFY THOSE

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:33.716
UNKNOWNS.

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:34.750
BUT THE FACT REMAINS THERE IS A

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:37.520
GREAT DEAL.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.021
ULTIMATELY IT'S TELLING AT THE

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.490
TELLING FACT THAT 90% OF

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:41.724
DRINKING WATER VIOLATIONS IN THE

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.459
STATE ARE FROM SYSTEMS UNDER

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:44.560
FIVE HUNDRED CONNECTIONS.

01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:46.162
WILL FRAGMENTATION OF THE WATER

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:47.630
SECTOR MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A KEY

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.165
TO THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER WE

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:50.032
KNOW WHEN IT KNOWLEDGE THE

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.068
REGIONALIZATION CONSOLIDATION OF

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.437

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:54.871
ADDRESSING THEIR ON

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.272
SUSTAINABILITY.

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:57.473
THERE CON ISN'T ECONOMIES OF

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.574
SCALE THAT NEED TO BE MET IN

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.309

IN A WHILE THE CHALLENGE OF

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:16.459
CLEAN DRINKING WATER MIGHT SEEM

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.227
TO BE A REAL ISSUE THE MAP ABOUT

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:19.896
A COMPLAINT SYSTEM SHOWS IT'S A

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.364
PROBLEM THAT IMPACTS COMMUNITIES

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:33.409
IN THE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY.

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.377
WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.311
STEPS THAT ARE TAKEN TO ADDRESS

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:36.679

I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE ISSUE

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.975
WATER FOR THE LAST DECADE FOR

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.409
OVER THIRTEEN YEARS.

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:41.377
REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE AT THIS

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:42.712
HEARING TO TALK ABOUT THIS

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.680
IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT I'VE

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.015
DEVOTED MY ENTIRE LIFE.

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:47.149
TO SOME OF US LIVE IN A WORLD

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:48.284
WHERE WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NO

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:49.752
SWELLING THE WATER USED TO BRUSH

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:50.653
OUR TEETH.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.787
SOME FAMILIES HAVE TO WORRY

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:52.922
ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEIR KIDS

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.890
TAKE BOTTLED WATER TO SCHOOL TO

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:56.425
AVOID HAVING TO DRINK THE WATER

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:57.426
FOUNTAIN BECAUSE AT THE SCHOOL

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:58.227
WE HAVE.

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.363
NIGHT NITRATES ARSENIC FROM SIX

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:01.631
SOME FAMILIES HAVE TO ENSURE

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.266
THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH WATER AT

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:04.900
HOME SO THAT WHEN THEY HAVE IN

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.068
WITH IT FAMILY COMING TO VISIT

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:07.270
THEM THEY HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO

01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:08.671
AVOID DRINKING TAP WATER.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.640
THIS IS A REALITY THAT WE HAVE

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:13.009
CURRENTLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:14.477
IT'S NOT OKAY.

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:16.312
WHEN WE SAY?

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:16.979
THAT OVER ONE MILLION

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:17.947
CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE SAFE

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.415
DRINKING WATER WE'RE TALKING

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:21.884
ABOUT CALIFORNIANS HUMANS THIS

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.719
MAP TO MY RIGHT SHOWS A REALLY

01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:25.121
GOOD INDICATION OF OVER THREE

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:25.688
HUNDRED SYSTEMS ARE OUT OF

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.390
COMPLIANCE HOWEVER AT THIS MAP

01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:28.858
FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALSO

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:29.225
HAVE.

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:30.693
MILLIONS OF PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.161
WITH CONTAMINATED WELLS AS WELL

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:33.529
SO THIS DOES NOT EVEN CAPTURE

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.131
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:36.866
THAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY.

01:05:36.932 --> 01:05:38.701
NOW I WILL SAY.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.335
THE MAJORITY THESE PUBLIC WATER

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.736
SYSTEMS ARE FOUND IN LOW INCOME

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.371
PEOPLE OF COLOR COMMUNITIES.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:43.739
AND DESPITE THE MILLION OF

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.875
FEDERAL TAX DOLLARS THAT WE BILL

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.476
THAT WE PASSED A BILL VAST

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:48.944
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PASSING A

01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:50.780
HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER IN TWO

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.281
THOUSAND TWELVE WE STILL CANNOT

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:54.817
GUARANTEE SEEM DRINKING WATER OP

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:55.751
TO ALL CALIFORNIANS.

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:58.054
LISTEN TO THAT.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.656
WE CAN WE EVEN WE PASS ALONG WE

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.158
STILL CANNOT INSURE THAT ALL OF

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:03.526
US CAN WAKE UP AND DRINK TAP

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:04.160
WATER WITHOUT THE FEAR BECOMING

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:06.028
SICK.

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:07.129
THERE'S JUST NOT OKAY AND I'M

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:08.364
NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT SANTEE

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.232
TOWNS I'M TALKING ABOUT FAMILIES

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:11.934
COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE OWN

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:13.269
THEIR HOME WHERE THEY PAY

01:06:13.336 --> 01:06:16.439
PROPERTY TAXES PLACES LIKE EL

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:19.175
PART IS TO ROSY. TO LEGAL PLAIN

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:21.043
VIEW BLUFF AND JUST BLUFF AND

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:21.877
JENSEN COMMUNITIES IN THE

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:22.945
CENTRAL COAST.

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:23.746
UNFORTUNATELY THESE COMMUNITIES

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.381
ARE NOT ALONE AND CITIES ARE NOT

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.283
EXEMPT AS WELL WE HAVE CITIES

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.084
LIKE URBAN THE DEAL WITH OUR

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.186
STICK CITIES I HAVE TRIED.

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:30.986
TRAILER METHANE SWITCHER BY

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:33.255
PRODUCT BY PRODUCT CHLORINATION

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.358
DIVIDE A BY PRODUCT BY PRODUCT

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:36.459
URINATION TREATMENT OF

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:37.760
SITUATIONS AGAIN I ALSO WANT TO

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:38.527
REMIND YOU.

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:42.832
THAT WHEN OVER 90% OF VALLEY

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:46.802
RESIDENTS CONTAMINANTS THAT NO

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.838
ONE NEEDS TO BE EXPOSED.

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:50.439
TO WE HAVE THINGS LIKE MY TREATS

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:51.674
LET ME REMIND YOU NATURE IS IN

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.342
THE QUEUE CONTAMINANT THAT HAS

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:54.176
BEEN LINKED TO THE BLUE BABY

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:56.312
SYNDROME AND CANCER AND KIDNEY

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:57.580
DISEASE.

01:06:57.646 --> 01:06:59.115
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:01.350
MEANS ARE HARD WORKING FAMILIES.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:02.618
OR HAVING TO PAY SOME OF THE

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.420
HIGH WATER RATES FOR WATER THEY

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:06.622
CANNOT DRINK.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:08.057
AND IN MANY SITUATIONS ON PAIN

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.092
SOME OF UP 210% OF THEIR

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.394
HOUSEHOLD INCOME ALONE JUST HAVE

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.628
THE DRINKING WATER.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:13.829
SO WE'RE HAVING HERE WE HAVE A

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:15.564
CRISIS WE HAVE CONTAMINATED

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:17.900
WATER GOING THROUGH OLD AND

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:20.035
DILAPIDATED INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:22.605
LEAD TO PEOPLE'S TAP.

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:23.606
I HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH TRADE OFFS

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:26.709
TO NOT DRINK THAT TAP WATER.

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:27.376
AND HAVE TO PAY WATER BILL THEY

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:28.310
CAN I USE FOR DRINKING AND STILL

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:29.745
HAVE TO BUY BOTTLED WATER.

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:33.315
THAT IS NOT OKAY.

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:34.850
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHALLENGES

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:35.885
ARE MULTI FACETED.

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:37.420
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

01:07:37.486 --> 01:07:39.522
THAT THIS CRISIS HAS BEEN AROUND

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:40.389
FOR A WHILE IT'S SYSTEMIC AND

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:41.891
HAS SIMMERED FOR YEARS.

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:44.126
HOWEVER AS A PROSPEROUS STATUS

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:46.061
AS CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE THE

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:47.229
SOLUTION.

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:48.631
THE BIGGEST GAP TO SOLVING THE

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:51.300
DRINKING WATER CRISIS IS PASSING

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:52.401
THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE WATER

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:52.868
FUND.

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:54.203
WE NEED TO CREATE.

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.273
A PERMANENT RELIABLE SOURCE OF

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:59.642
FUNDING THE NATO. TO BE ABLE TO

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.610
HAVE THE SOLUTIONS WE NEED.

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.479
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:04.079
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:05.281
LIVES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:08.484
SCHOOLS.

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:11.687
LAST YEAR IN.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:12.888
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OVER ONE

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:13.989
FORTY LABOR COMMUNITY AND HEALTH

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:14.523
AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATION

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.425
SUPPORTED A PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.494
THAT WOULD CREATE THE SAME FOR

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:20.396
THE FOUR OH DRINKING WATER FUND.

01:08:20.463 --> 01:08:21.564
THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE THAT WE

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:22.565
WERE EVEN TALKING ABOUT HAVING

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:23.766
EXTENSIVELY BEEN DISCUSSED AND I

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.501
CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND.

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:27.269
OUR COMMUNITIES BELIEVE THE

01:08:27.336 --> 01:08:27.903
SAFER FOR DRINKING WATER POINT

WILL ULTIMATELY HELP THEM SOLVE

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:30.973
THIS ISSUE.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.876
AND BE ABLE TO OPEN UP THE TAP

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:34.510
WATER WITHOUT THE PURE BECOMING

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:35.444
SICK.

WE LOOK TO YOU TO HELP PASS THIS

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.482
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THIS YEAR.

WE HAVE NO TIME TO WAIT ANYMORE.

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:43.452
THE BIGGEST GAP TO THIS CRISIS

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:44.286
IS THE LACK OF SUSTAINABLE

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.722
FUNDING FOR OPERATION AND

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:49.792
MAINTENANCE FOR COMMUNITIES.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.193
WE CAN ON YOU TO HELP US PASS

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.962
THE SUPERBOWL DRINKING WATER FUN.

01:08:58.467 --> 01:08:59.969
THESE SYSTEMS?

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.770
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRINK TAP

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:02.872
WATER WITHOUT THE FEELING OF

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:03.072
SICK.

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:05.441
THANK YOU.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:06.842
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK

DEDICATION AND THE TRUE PASSION

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.550
THE TO BRING TO THIS ISSUE --

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:16.118
AT THIS POINT WE CAN PAUSE

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.087
SUFFER QUESTIONS OF FOR ARE

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:20.623
THERE ARE ANY FOR THIS PANEL.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:21.657
MISTER QUIRK --

AGAIN WE WE ALL AGREE ON THE

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.360
PROBLEM.

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:26.562
ARE WE CAN AGREE ON HOW IT CAN

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:28.097
BE SOLVED --

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:31.600
BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS GRAY ON

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.102
HOW TO FIND THIS.

01:09:33.168 --> 01:09:34.203
NOW.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.704
IF IT COMES OUT OF THE GENERAL

01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:38.107
FUND WE CAN ALL VOTE FOR THAT

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:39.942
EIGHTY VOTES IN THE ASSEMBLY

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.944
FORTY VOTES IN THE SENATE.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.280
COME BY OUR I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:46.048
THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE.

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:48.450
I CAN SAY THAT IN MY DISTRICT I

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:50.052
DON'T EXPECT ANY OF THE MONEY TO

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:51.320
COME TO ME THAT I HAVE ALREADY

01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:53.055
SAID WHETHER IT'S FROM THE

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.624
GENERAL FUND OR A TAX OR FEE I'M

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.927
WILLING TO GO AHEAD --

01:09:57.993 --> 01:09:59.929
AND AGAIN I'M NOT ASKING THAT

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.430
EVERYONE ELSE MAKE THAT PLEDGE

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:03.666
TODAY BUT I AM ASKING YOU TO

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.935
THINK ABOUT IT --

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.636
YESTERDAY --

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:11.173
TUESDAY WE HEARD ABOUT.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.342
THE NEED FOR FUNDS TO REDUCE

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:15.911
FINES FOR THE VERY POOR PEOPLE

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:17.379
GO THROUGH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:19.048
SYSTEM.

01:10:19.114 --> 01:10:21.183
AND THAT'S ONE POINT SEVEN

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:24.753
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR --

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.121
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT COME FROM

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:27.623
THE GENERAL FUND BUT I DON'T

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:28.958
THINK IT IS --

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:31.193
HOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.128
THAT I COULD I CAN'T TELL YOU --

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:34.964
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IN MY

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.966
DISTRICT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:38.467
AND IN FACT ARE COUNTIES.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:40.302
IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ALAMEDA

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.404
HAVE AGREED INCLUDING THE COUNTY

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:47.343
I SERVE TO FOREGO THOSE FIGHTS --

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.410
BUT IT'S IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE TO

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:50.646
BE MADE AND I WOULD JUST ASK

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:51.614
EVERYONE HERE.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.816
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IN THE BAY

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:56.218
AREA AND IN LA MOST OF WHOSE

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:59.254
DISTRICTS DO NOT INVOLVE SYSTEMS

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:01.023
WITH WATER PROBLEMS THAT THE

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.191
VOTES WILL BE THERE IF IT'S

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:04.860
NECESSARY FOR FEAR TAX.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.562
AND I WOULD ASK THE PEOPLE FROM

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:09.531
THE RURAL AREAS AS WELL.

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.533
WHERE AND?

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.568
ADMITTEDLY THERE IS A

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:13.602
EDUCATIONAL --

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.371
URBAN AREA BUT MOSTLY IT'S CAN

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:16.872
BE IN THE RURAL AREAS I WOULD

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.507
ASK THOSE FOLKS AS WELL. TO

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:21.577
THINK CAREFULLY RIGHT NOW AND

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:23.078
HOPEFULLY COME TOGETHER.

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:25.547
AND IF NECESSARY TO PASS A FEAR

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:29.184
ATTACKS TO DO SO THANK YOU.

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:30.986
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:33.689
NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS --

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:36.358
MR MATHIS.

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:37.559
SO I'LL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:38.360
BECAUSE I'VE GOT SEVERAL

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:43.132
QUESTIONS REGARDING TO FUNDING --

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:45.234
IN THIS ARE PROBABLY BEST --

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:50.172
DIRECTED FOR ALL THE STRESS WALL --

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.173
AND AND MISTER CRAWFORD I'M SURE

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:51.707
YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME THE

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.676
ANSWERS AND AND I DO APPRECIATE

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:54.943
ALL THE WORK THAT ALL OF YOU --

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:57.746
SUSAN IS FROM MY DISTRICT AND WE

01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:58.914
TALK A LOT.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.282
AND I LOVE YOUR FASHION I'M GLAD

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:01.483
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.452
PUSHING THIS FORWARD --

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:04.987
BUT AGAIN MY CONCERNS OR OR TO

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:10.426
COST IN IF IT'S ENOUGH --

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:11.326
YOU KNOW WE WE JUST TALKED ABOUT

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:13.062
YOU KNOW THERE'S OVER TWO

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.229
HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR WATER SYSTEMS

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:15.898
THAT WERE TRACKING PLUS.

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:18.367
SEVERAL THOUSAND OTHER ONES SHOW

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:20.769
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO RUN ONE

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:22.137
OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND I KNOW IT

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:23.939
DEPENDS ON WHETHER IT'S OUR

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.140
SNICKER NITRATE TO CETERA.

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:26.408
OR EVEN ON THE COAST SALT WATER

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.177
INTRUSION SO I MEAN DO WE HAVE

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:30.946
AN AVERAGE COST.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.881
PER SYSTEM.

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:34.983
THAT YOU CAN GIVE US OR OR JUST

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.618
A GUESSTIMATE TO GIVE US KIND OF

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:37.853
GO FROM POINT IT WOULD BE A GAS

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.121
AND SO I WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.556
THROW SOME OF FIGURE OUT TO I I

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:41.657
CAN TALK TO OUR DIVISION THE

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:42.958
DRINKING WATER AND SEE IF WE

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:43.358
HAVE.

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:44.893
YOU KNOW THE THE DIFFICULTY AS

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.128
YOU POINTED OUT IS.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:46.695
IT DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.797
CONNECTIONS IT DEPENDS WHAT YOUR

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:49.732
TREATMENT TRAIN IS IT DEPENDS

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:51.433
THE SIZE OF YOUR DISTRIBUTION

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.534
CENTER SO.

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.236
YOU KNOW TO PLUCK OUT WHAT A

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:57.940
SORT OF A NO A RANGE OF SOME

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:59.308
SORT WILL.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:00.709
HALF A MILLION A YEAR A MILLION

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:02.745
A YEAR I MEAN KIDS BECAUSE AGAIN

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:03.545
WHAT WE WERE PROPOSING LOOKING

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:05.881
AT IS A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION A

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:06.548
YEAR.

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:10.519
AND WE SEE A NUMBER LIKE.

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:11.120
TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR YOU'RE

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:12.688
TALKING CHANGING FILTERS YOU'RE

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.323
TALKING STAFFING YOU'RE TALKING

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:15.424
KEEPING THE SYSTEMS RUNNING THE

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.659
MAIN AND SIX CETERA I THINK.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:18.861
IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.229
THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:21.130
ON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR THAT

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:24.299
FUND IS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO A

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:26.568
TO A FULL PAY FOR THE OPERATION

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:28.303
WHOLE OPERATION OF A SYSTEM.

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:29.304
RIGHT --

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:32.741
THAT YOU KNOW IT MAY BE A IT'S

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:34.610
GOING TO BE A COMBINATION SO.

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:35.844
SAVE YOU COME INTO A COMMUNITY.

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:36.478
THERE'S AN ISSUE YOU HAVE MAYBE

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:38.480
A NUMBER FAILING SYSTEMS MAYBE

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:40.582
THERE'S YOU KNOW TEN OR ELEVEN

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.017
SYSTEMS WITHIN A GIVEN AREA.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.685
THE WORK THAT WOULD BE DONE IS

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:44.820
WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:46.121
REGIONALIZATION FIRST AND

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:47.422
FOREMOST YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU SO

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:48.724
WHAT IS WHAT IS THE RATE PAYER

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:49.925
BASE WITHIN THAT.

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:52.161
WITHIN THAT THAT AREA SO YOU MAY

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:54.296
THEN PACKAGE TOGETHER --

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:56.498
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAN --

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.433
THEY MAY THEN --

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:02.604
ALSO THEN IDENTIFY CAPITAL AND

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:04.506
TO AND AND AND NOW IT IS DONE I

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.341
I I I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT SORT

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:07.776
OF OPERATION MAINTENANCE OR

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:10.078
RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT I AND I

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:11.780
KNOW MISTER CROW FOOT AND I WERE.

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.382
TREMENDOUSLY WITH THE SIDE PART

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:14.516
OF BILL WITH ANNEXING PART OF

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.552
THE AREA IN --

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:18.020
WHAT YOU COULD PLACE WELL COST

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:19.688
PLUS TREATMENT PLUS EVERYTHING

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:20.289
ELSE?

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:21.657
BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:23.025
THE THE NUMBERS THAT I WANT TO

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.360
HEAR BACK ON TRACK OR HOW MUCH

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:26.428
IT COST --

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:28.363
SMALL COMMUNITY SYSTEMS VERSUS

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.731
LARGER SYSTEMS.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:32.668
ON YOU MENTIONED THE END ON A

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:33.902
WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN THAT

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.204
NUMBER IS A DISTINGUISHING

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:37.873
BETWEEN THE THE COST PER PERSON

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.342
IN THE STATE EXACTLY SO I LARGER

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:41.143
LARGER SIDE OF LOVE TO SAY I I

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:42.077
THINK SPECIALLY WITH THE BUDGET

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.278
PROPOSAL COMING UP.

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:45.047
THOSE NUMBERS IN THOSE ANSWERS

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:46.882
ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT --

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:47.749
YOU'D ALSO MENTIONED THE LA

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:49.585
INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:52.921
IS AGED SO A COST ON WHAT THAT

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:53.889
WOULD LOOK LIKE AND

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.591
PROPORTIONATE WITH THEIR SYSTEMS

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.125
ON FIXING THAT.

01:14:57.192 --> 01:15:00.062
AS WELL AS IF THERE'S A NUMBER

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:02.264
OUT THERE ON THE COST TO CLEAN

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:09.805
UP THE BLOOM THAT IS IN --

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:13.508
I IT WAS ALL WATER INTRUSION

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:15.177
ALONG OUR COASTAL CITIES.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:16.011
AND THE COST OF DEALING WITH

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:17.446
THAT AND IF ANY OF THIS FUNDING

01:15:17.512 --> 01:15:18.680
WOULD GO TO THE CLEAN DRINKING

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.415
WATER ASPECT OF THAT FOR ANY OF

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:21.683
THOSE CITIES THAT ARE DOING

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.051
GROUND WATER.

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:23.652
THAT ARE DOING THE SALT WATER

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:26.221
INTRUSION AS WELL AS DEALING

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.123
WITH THE CROWN SIX FACTORS FOR

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.191
ANY.

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.259
AREAS THAT ARE DONE WITH

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:32.160
COLORADO RIVER WATER BECAUSE

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:33.495
IT'S NATIONAL ECOLOGY FROM THOSE

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:35.030
SYSTEMS --

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:35.964
ESPECIALLY.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:40.669
AND THE COACHELLA VALLEY AREA

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:42.804
AND THOSE DEALS.

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:44.406
AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION TO

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:44.873
YOU IS DO WE HAVE ANY

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.209
PROJECTIONS ON THE FERTILIZER

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:48.977
TAX -- WHAT

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:51.513
THAT MADE DO WITH A INFLATION ON

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.948
FOOD PRICING?

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:54.716
AS WELL AS WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:56.418
OUR SOCIAL SECURITY NET AND

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:58.954
PAYING FOR WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.155
IS FOOD STAMPS AND WHAT THE

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.490
ADDITIONAL COST ON THE STATE

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:02.391
WOULD BE.

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.927
ON THAT SIDE DEALING WITH THAT

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.361
INFLATION PRICE.

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:08.463
AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.766
BASIC NUMBERS I'D LIKE TO SEE --

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:13.535
AS WE LOOK BECAUSE AGAIN MY MY

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:15.070
LARGEST CONCERN IS I THEY HAVE A

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:17.239
REALLY HARD TIME THINKING A

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:18.273
HUNDRED FORTY MILLION.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.741
IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO COVER

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:22.144
THE STATE STATEWIDE AND I REALLY

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:22.678
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:24.012
SOMETHING.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:24.846
THAT'S GONNA PUT MORE INTO IT

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:28.183
AND THEN ALL WE ALL KNOW.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:31.253
A HUGE PART OF THE GROUND WATER --

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.055
CLEAN UP IS DUE TO THE FACT OF

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:35.190
THE DROUGHT THE DEPLETED WATER

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.558
THAT'S DOWN THERE.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.393
AND WE HAVE TO DO GROUNDWATER

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.996
RECHARGE WHICH WILL ADD TO THOSE

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:43.131
BAY SANDS WHICH WILL DIE LIEU

01:16:43.198 --> 01:16:44.800
ANY TOXINS AND GET US TO WATER

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:46.435
QUALITY STANDARDS THAT WE KNOW

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:46.969
WE NEED.

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:48.470
CHAU WOULD ANY OF THIS FUNDING

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.172
ACTUALLY GO TOWARDS RECHARGE

01:16:50.238 --> 01:16:51.707
PROJECTS WHICH WE KNOW WOULD

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.342
INCREASE --

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.177
THE QUALITY OF THE WATER THAT'S

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:57.079
IN THE GROUND.

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.914
IF I COULD ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I

01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:00.082
KNOW THAT'S A LOT YEAH NO IT'S

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:01.316
BUT IT'S THERE AND THEY'RE

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:02.050
HELPFUL QUESTIONS --

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.585
ON THE SECOND QUESTION REGARDING

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:05.287
THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OF OF OF

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:06.755
THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN IN

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.757
FERTILIZER FEE --

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.592
WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU AND WILL --

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:11.760
WORK WITH THAT CALIFORNIA

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:13.228
APARTMENT FOOD AGRICULTURE JUST

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.596
TO CHARACTERIZE ANY POTENTIAL

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:16.732
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OF THAT

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.367
INCREASE --

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:21.169
I WILL SAY TO YOUR FIRST

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:22.404
QUESTION I WOULD JUST --

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.573
IDENTIFY FOR THE COMMITTEES --

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:27.376
THE FAIRLY A TECHNICAL ESTIMATE --

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:28.677
THAT -- WAS

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:30.645
GENERATED LAST YEAR TO INFORM

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:33.548
THE THE ESTIMATED COST OF

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:35.751
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS IN THOSE

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:36.852
COMMUNITIES WITHOUT --

01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:38.587
SAFE DRINKING WATER THIS IS

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:40.255
OBVIOUSLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.757
THAT TOPIC IS NOT BEEN --

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:44.693
FULLY TACKLE BEFORE AND A

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.028
PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND SOLUTION

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:47.829
IS HIGHLY LOCALIZED BUT I WILL

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:48.997
TELL YOU THAT A FAIRLY DETAILED

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:50.532
METHODOLOGY --

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:52.701
WAS ESTABLISHED TO ESTIMATE THE

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:54.036
COST --

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:55.737
SPECIFICALLY DOES --

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.372
SYSTEMS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY NAY

01:17:57.439 --> 01:17:59.274
TRADE ONLY POLLUTION --

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.509
THAT ARE IMPACTED BY NAY TRADE

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:01.910
POLLUTION AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:03.078
OR OTHER CONTAMINANTS Là IN

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:04.679
THAT'S THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.014
QUESTION WITH THE RECHARGE.

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:06.982
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW A LOT OF THE

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:09.084
AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE HIGH

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:10.585
NITRATE CONTENT ARE ALSO

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:13.088
AFFECTED FROM THE DROUGHT IN.

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.523
THE AQUIFER'S OF DRUG

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.558
SIGNIFICANTLY THERE AND I KNOW

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:18.593
ONE OF THE VIABLE THINGS THAT'S

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.862
BEEN USED IS TO CONVEY WATER

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:21.897
DOWN TO THOSE AREAS A NEW

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.398
SURFACE WATER IN LIEU OF

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:24.699
GROUNDWATER.

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.668
BUT WITH THAT IF WE HAVE OUR OWN

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:27.736
CHALLENGES WITH CONVEYANCE

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.171
SYSTEMS AND MAINTENANCE OF THOSE

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:30.338
SYSTEMS.

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:32.407
ON IN IN KEEPING THEM UP TO DATE

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:34.843
UP TO STANDARD --

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:37.212
SO YOU KNOW IS THAT COST

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:40.682
FACTORED IN ON MAINTAINING THOSE

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:41.950
CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS AS WELL.

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:42.651
UNDERSTOOD I WOULD JUST MAKE

01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:43.452
THREE FINAL POINTS ONE IS THE

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:44.986
LEGISLATURE WISELY APPROPRIATED

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:46.221
FUNDING FOR A MORE DETAILED

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:47.856
NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT THE WATER

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.025
BOARD IS IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING --

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:51.226
WHICH WILL.

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:54.963
BE IMPORTANT --

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:56.431
AND THAT I'VE ACTUALLY JUST LET

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:57.499
ME LET ME TAKE A MOMENT AS THE

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.134
OTHER TWO POINTS WILL IN ON THAT

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:00.368
NEEDS ASSESSMENT WOULD WILL WE

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:00.936
DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.370
ENGAGING WITH YOUR OFFICE SO

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:03.271
THAT YOU CAN.

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:04.739
UNDERSTAND THE DATA SETS WE HAVE

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:05.974
YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE ABLE TO

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:07.309
CHARACTERIZE ISSUES IN THE

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.077
COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW AND TRY TO

01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:09.678
GET SOME YOUR ANSWERS TO THE

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:10.645
NUMBERS AND AND I WOULD JUST

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.514
MAKE TWO FINAL POINTS ONE IS AS

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:13.882
I THINK THE SENATOR NOTED.

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.450
ON THE CURRENT PROPOSAL --

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:17.018
THAT AT LEAST WAS INTRODUCED

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.386
LAST YEAR.

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:23.658
CAPS THE THAT CONSUMER SURCHARGE

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:25.260
THAT -- IF

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:27.095
IF THAT WERE ACTUALLY PASSED --

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:28.463
THAT THERE WOULD BE --

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:29.464
YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE AN

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:30.966
ABILITY TO INCREASE THAT AFFECT

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:32.567
THE COST OUT WENT UP BUT I WILL

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:34.436
NOTE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:35.604
TODAY IS THAT.

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:37.272
SEVERAL HUNDRED OF THESE SYSTEMS --

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:39.007
I HAVE MAJOR ISSUES THAT CANNOT

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:40.242
BE ADDRESSED WITHOUT A ON GOING

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:41.209
FUNDING SOURCE.

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:43.411
SO WE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:45.046
YOU KNOW --

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:46.348
BEFORE AROUND TO IN TERMS OF

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:47.616
REALLY TRYING TO GET PRECISE AND

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:48.717
WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:50.185
PRECISE ON THE OVERALL ESTIMATE.

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:52.120
WE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE DON'T

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:52.687
WANT TO MAKE THE PERFECT THE

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:54.523
ENEMY OF THE GOOD IN OTHER WORDS

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:56.358
WE KNOW WE HAVE TO GET TO WORK --

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:58.193
SOLVING THESE CHALLENGES AND

01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.294
LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY FOR TO

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:01.196
DETERMINE QUIRKS --

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:01.796
JUST RAISING THIS QUESTION OF

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.198
GENERAL FUND PART OF THE

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:04.833
CHALLENGING NATURE OF THE OF THE

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:06.301
NEED FOR I'M GOING OPERATIONS

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:07.736
AND MAINTENANCE.

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:09.271
IS IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:10.872
AND I WOULD ARGUE PROBABLY

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:14.042
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND I'M GOING --

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:14.910
TO OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.178
CONTRACTS IN THE SMALL

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:17.746
COMMUNITIES WITH ONE TIME

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:20.849
GENERAL FUND --

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:23.585
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE OLOGY

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.654
BUT YOU ONLY ARE FUNDED OFFER A

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.488
YEAR OF OPERATIONS AND

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.223
MAINTENANCE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:29.524
TO ESTABLISH A SERVICE CONTRACT

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.293
WITH THE TECHNICAL PROVIDER. TO

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.261
ACTUALLY OPERATE YOUR SYSTEM SO

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.196
THAT REALLY IS THE NEED FOR THE

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.764
ON GOING --

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.132
A FUNDING SOURCE MOLD AND THAT'S

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:38.099
THAT'S WHY I'M LOOKING AT A

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:40.168
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE ON GOING

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:42.003
GENERAL FUND --

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.171
TIED IN WITH THE STATE

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:44.606
CONSTITUTION GOING TO THE HUMAN

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:47.275
RIGHT A WATER --

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.044
A AND I MEAN AGAIN THE INK THE

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.679
BIGGER THING WITH WATER IT AS WE

01:20:50.745 --> 01:20:51.646
ALL KNOW WATER IS A VERY

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:52.981
HOLISTIC SYSTEM ALL THE WAY FROM

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:55.417
HEADWATERS. TO CONVEYANCE TO

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:56.985
STORES TO RECHARGE TO CLEAN UP

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:59.087
IN THE WHOLE LINE SO WE'VE GOT

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:00.055
TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER WE'RE

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:02.057
DOING WE TAKE IN ALL ASPECTS OF

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:02.857
THAT.

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:04.359
AND I UNDERSTAND WERE HYPER

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:06.027
FOCUSED ON THE CLEAN WATER PART

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:07.629
BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:08.997
SUFFERING THAT SHOULDN'T BE

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:09.764
SUFFERING.

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:16.238
AND THE AGAIN WITH THE SUSAN'S

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:16.538
PASSION --

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:18.173
AND WE'RE SHE HEADQUARTERED

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.641
RIGHT LIKE TWO BLOCKS FROM MY

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.042
OFFICE SO WE TALKED A LOT --

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:22.177
AND PROBABLY SHOULD TOOK ON A

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:23.678
LOT MORE BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:25.580
BEING INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:28.817
THE PROCESS ON THIS.

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:31.152
AND I EXPECT TO BE --

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:33.722
BECAUSE I'M NOT FULLY CONVINCED

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:35.090
YET AND I'M SURE MANY OF MY

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:37.325
COLLEAGUES ARE THERE AS WELL.

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:39.127
THAT I I DON'T THINK THIS IS

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:42.597
ENOUGH HELL OF A LOT BETTER.

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:44.199
AND I THINK WE DESERVE IS IS WE

01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:45.800
TALKED WE MADE THIS A HUMAN

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:48.670
RIGHT TO WATER. FOR OUR STATE

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.205
AND I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.339
PUT SOMETHING IN OUR STATE

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:53.108
CONSTITUTION THAT THE FINES THAT

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:54.342
THAT GUARANTEES AND LOCKS THE

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:55.710
FUNDING IN THERE.

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:56.878
SO THAT WE HAVE AN ON GOING

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:58.680
FUNDING STREAM SO THERE ISN'T A

01:21:58.747 --> 01:21:59.848
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS

01:21:59.914 --> 01:22:00.815
IS ENOUGH.

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.117
AND THEN WE CAN PRIORITIZE

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:04.319
PROJECTS BASED ON THAT AND

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:05.720
PRIORITIZE THE MAINTENANCE AND

01:22:05.787 --> 01:22:07.455
EVERYTHING ELSE TO ENSURE.

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:10.325
THAT WE'RE NOT JUST DOING THIS

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:11.593
TO TO ATTACK COLD ONE ASPECT

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.361
OVER COVERING THE FULL WATER

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:16.264
SYSTEM OF CALIFORNIA FOREVER FOR

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:17.766
ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS THANK YOU

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:20.702
ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.871
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY.

01:22:22.937 --> 01:22:23.538
I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:24.139
I APPRECIATE --

01:22:24.205 --> 01:22:24.873
THE INFORMATION I REALLY DON'T

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.608
HAVE A QUESTION I JUST HAVE A

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:27.175
COMMENT I DID A BILL COUPLE

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:28.910
YEARS AGO --

01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:30.145
DURING THE DROUGHT WHEN WE WERE

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.479
WE WERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:33.081
PORTERVILLE AND YOU KNOW THE

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:34.249
WELLS AND THOUGH SO I TRIED IT

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:36.418
THAT. TO ONE OF THE CRITICISMS I

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:37.719
HAVE IS THAT --

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.454
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:41.056
TALK ABOUT REGIONALIZATION WHICH

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:42.357
WE NEED WE NEED TO TAKE THESE

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:43.958
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NEXT TO

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:45.393
EACH OTHER AND MAKE A SYSTEM

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.429
THAT IS EFFICIENT THAT WORKS

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:48.730
TOTALLY GET THAT.

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.198
BUT I DID A BILL THAT TIME.

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:52.500
ALLOWED TO DO AT THE SOURCE

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:54.169
FILTRATION SO THAT WE COULD

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:56.338
ACTUALLY RIGHT THEN PUT.

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:58.306
IN THE LINE SOMETHING THAT

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:01.810
FILTERS HE WAS A LITTLE HOW TO

01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:03.345
MADE AS WELL TRUST ME I WOULD

01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:04.646
LEARN HOW TO MADE IT'S A FILTER

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:06.147
AT MY HOUSE IF IT MEANT MY KIDS

01:23:06.214 --> 01:23:07.882
GOT TO DRINK THE WATER THAT CAME

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:09.117
OUT OF THE TAP SO.

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:11.019
I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:12.954
ALL THESE --

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:14.522
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:15.957
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE THE

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:17.792
COST DOWN --

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:19.627
AND SERVE MORE PEOPLE SO I JUST

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:20.462
WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THAT

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:21.429
SOMETHING THAT --

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.098
I ACTUALLY TRIED TO DO --

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.299
SEEMED LIKE A COMMON SENSE

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:26.067
APPROACH TO ME --

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:27.569
THAT WAY WE THE BILL DIED IN THE

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:28.570
SENATE AND IT DIDN'T DIDN'T

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:30.205
HAPPEN SO WOULD YOU TAKE THAT

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:31.373
INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE I

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:32.307
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FAMILIES

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:33.341
OUT THERE LEARN HOW.

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.076
TO MAKE THIS A FILTER IF THEIR

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:38.146
KIDS CAN DRINK GOOD WATER.

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:45.086
MAYBE IN ONE OF A MEMBER.

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.154
THE ONE WE CAN RESPOND ASSEMBLY

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:46.821
MEMBER YES ABSOLUTELY THAT THAT

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:49.491
THAT WE NEED WE NEED TO CONSIDER --

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:50.992
TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS TO DRIVE

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.293
DOWN THE COST PARTICULARLY

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.028
DECENTRALIZED FILTRATION I WOULD

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:55.497
JUST ADD THAT.

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:56.664
AS I'VE HEARD THE CONVERSATION

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.032
CHARACTERIZED ON THIS NOTION OF

01:23:58.099 --> 01:24:00.435
SORT OF DECENTRALIZED FILTRATION

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:01.903
OR UNDER THE SINK FILTRATION.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.638
WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.941
YOU KNOW FILTRATION --

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:07.776
TECHNOLOGY OR EQUIPMENT WAS

01:24:07.842 --> 01:24:08.877
PROVIDED --

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.745
SO YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WE'VE

01:24:10.812 --> 01:24:11.646
COME TO EXPECT IN OUR

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:12.847
COMMUNITIES IS YOU KNOW THE

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:14.215
RIPPED OUT THE WATER FLOWING OUT

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:15.717
OF YOUR TAP IS SAFE AND CLEAN.

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:17.318
AND WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO AVOID

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:19.287
IS THAT YOU KNOW TO HOUSEHOLDS

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:20.755
NEXT TO EACH OTHER --

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:22.223
YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY --

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:23.825
HAVE DIFFERENT QUALITY WATER --

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:27.896
SIMPLY BY YOU KNOW THE BEHAVIOR

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:28.596
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE.

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:29.964
IF I MAY IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:30.632
THESE.

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:31.699
FOLKS WRONG WELLS IN THERE AND

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:33.301
THAT SERVICING THAT HOUSE AND

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:34.869
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING A

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:36.070
SYSTEM IS CUT AND IT'S IT'S

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:37.672
SOMETIMES TENS OF THOUSAND

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:38.273
DOLLARS TO GET OUT TO SERVICE

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:38.940
THEM.

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.008
YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.109
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COST AND GO

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:42.377
CAN WE STILL AND I KNOW THAT

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:43.845
THERE'S DIFFERENT CONTAMINANTS

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.313
THAT SOME FILTERS DON'T WORK IN

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:46.815
SOME I GET ALL THAT I I I HEARD

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.283
IT ALL IN MY IN THE TESTIMONY

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:49.617
WHEN I RAN THE BILL.

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:51.886
BUT I KNOW I KNOW FOR A FACT

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:54.088
THAT THERE ARE SOME CONTENT IT'S

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:55.690
WE CAN TAKE OUT RIGHT AT THE AT

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.091
THE HOUSE AND THERE'S WE SHOULD

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:58.159
BE DOING THAT IT'S IT'S A MATTER

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:00.094
OF SOMEBODY NOT HAVING A DIRT

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:01.930
BIRTH DEFECT BY HAVING CLEAN

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:03.865
WATER THAT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:04.966
TO ME AND IT DRIVES ACOSTA --

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.601
SO I I KNOW YOU'LL TAKE IT INTO

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:07.669
CONSIDERATION AND EITHER BE A

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:09.204
LOT EXPERTS OUT THERE SAYING YOU

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.305
KNOW WILL THE KIDS WHAT ACROSS

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:10.972
THE STREET.

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:12.574
AT IN THE DAY WE STILL NEED TO

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.775
GET THOSE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.009
TO BE ABLE TO TRY THAT COST DOWN

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:16.878
AND GET GET CLEAN WATER AT THE

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:17.445
SOURCE.

01:25:17.512 --> 01:25:18.313
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:19.781
IMPORTANT TO ON THE TOOL SET AND

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.216
I WOULD JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.851
THINK RECENTLY WE JUST CLARIFIED

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:23.651
OUR POINT OF VIEW SOME POINT OF

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.253
ENTRY --

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.958
TECHNOLOGY RAGS --

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:33.495
OR OR USE RAGS YOU THOUGHT IT

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:35.463
SNOW WE NEED WE NEED THE SORT OF

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:36.631
AN TRUMP --

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.233
TOOLS AND SOLUTIONS BECAUSE

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.868
REALLY IT'S ABOUT ACTUALLY

01:25:39.934 --> 01:25:43.371
PROVIDE THAT TAPE I CAN CLEAN

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:43.738
DRINKING WATER.

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:45.340
ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:46.374
MAY JUST ADD TO THAT I I AGREE

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:47.008
WITH THE CONVERSATION OF HAVING

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:48.076
SHORT TERM OPTIONS.

01:25:48.142 --> 01:25:48.743
HOWEVER THE NEEDS TO BE TIED TO

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:51.012
A LONG TERM SOLUTION I WILL SAY

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.680
SOME AREAS --

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.282
HAVE SIX TIMES THE MCL FOR

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:55.550
NITRATES SO WE DON'T HAVE A

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:56.684
CERTIFIED FILTRATION DEVICE

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:58.419
STEVEN OFFER THESE FAMILIES.

01:25:58.486 --> 01:25:59.053
AND YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.255
ISSUE OF MAKING SURE YOU DO

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:02.123
PROPER MAINTENANCE SO I IT'S

01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:03.324
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT SHORT

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:06.594
TERM SOLUTIONS BUT WE HAVE TO

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:08.563
TIE THAT TO LONG TERM STRATEGY.

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:10.231
AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO IT TO MY

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:11.132
KNOWLEDGE THERE'S NOTHING AND

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:13.101
ANY OF THE LEGISLATION THAT I'VE

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:15.036
SEEN OR PROPOSALS THAT I'VE.

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:15.570
THAT I'VE SEEN THAT WOULD

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:17.472
PRECLUDE --

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:19.073
A SPENDING MONEY IN THAT WAY --

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.608
THERE'S NO ONE SIZE I THINK

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:22.210
EVERYBODY AGREES THERE'S NO ONE

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:23.511
SIZE FITS ALL --

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:25.113
SOLUTION FOR EVERY COMMUNITY AND

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:26.614
EVERY SYSTEM.

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:28.650
HERE -- NEXT

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:30.552
UP WE HAVE A DOCTOR ARAMBULA.

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:34.122
THANK YOU AND SHE DOESN'T NEED

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:35.490
NAME BUT IT'S WHOSE ON I JUST

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:38.259
WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE RECOGNIZE

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:43.498
THAT WASN'T SUSAN --

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:44.899
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE MY THE GUY

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:47.302
WAS ON THE PANEL AS WELL BUT

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:49.370
THERE'S A BIT OF PRIDE IN WHAT

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:50.038
OUR NAMES ARE AND WHERE WE COME

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:51.339
FROM -- I

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:51.973
DON'T WANT TO MISS AN

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.108
OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO CHANNEL AND

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:56.377
TALK ABOUT RECHARGE AS WE LOOK

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:58.346
AT 90% OF THE VALLEY WHICH IS

01:26:58.413 --> 01:27:00.415
DEPENDENT ON GROUND WATER WE

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:01.883
HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH AS THE STATE.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.017
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:05.186
OUR MOST VITAL RESOURCE IN OUR

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:07.555
SAFEST BANK ACCOUNT BLOWER GRANT.

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:10.058
AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:12.827
STOP ARGUING ABOUT FISH AND TAKE

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:15.296
THE WATER THAT WE CAN AGREE

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:17.065
SHOULD BE RECHARGED.

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:18.533
AND START ME CHARGING SO I LOOK

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.068
FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:22.203
CONVERSATIONS. TO FIGURE OUT IF

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:23.671
THAT'S A LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:26.040
WE CAN HELP WITH SOME OF THE TO

01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:28.109
DILUTE SOME OF THE POLLUTION

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:29.544
THAT CURRENTLY IS OCCURRING THAT

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:32.614
NATURALLY.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.448
OCCURRING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:35.717
BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:27:35.783 --> 01:27:37.285
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM.

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:39.020
NOW IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.489
THIS IS IN MY BACKYARD LATER

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:43.391
TODAY IM GOING TO MEET WITH.

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:45.393
MEMBERS FROM LAND AIR AND FROM

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.628
COME TO A CREEK AND FROM

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:48.663
TOMBSTONE TERRITORY PLACES THAT

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:50.198
ARE ON MY NECK OF THE WOODS

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:52.433
PLACES THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:52.867
HEARD.

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:56.037
BUT THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO I TOOK

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:56.571
CARE OF IN MY PRACTICE OF

01:27:56.638 --> 01:27:57.572
MEDICINE.

01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:59.374
WHO OFTENTIMES COULDN'T STAY

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.309
HEALTHY BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:02.844
WERE OR WERE NOT PUTTING INTO

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:04.212
THEIR BODY?

01:28:04.278 --> 01:28:05.647
AND WHEN WE DON'T HAVE SAVE

01:28:05.713 --> 01:28:08.116
SOLUTIONS LIKE BEING PRESENTED

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:09.484
BEFORE US.

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:11.252
I WANT TO FIRST ASK ARE WE

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:14.055
DEALING WITH IT LARGELY AND OFF.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:17.525
I WANT TO CONCURRENT THAT I WISH

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:19.293
SENATOR MONNING HAD HERE LAST

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.194
YEAR.

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:21.229
BECAUSE WE'D BE A LOT FURTHER

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:23.598
DOWNSTREAM AND DEALING WITH THE

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:25.199
PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US.

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:27.235
BUT ARE WE ADDRESSING ENOUGH

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:30.104
RESOURCES TOWARDS THIS PROBLEM

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:31.706
IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:33.207
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH.

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:35.376
OR DO WE NEED TO COUPLE THAT

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.378
WITH A LARGE ONE TIME INVESTMENT

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:40.615
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DEAL WITH

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:42.250
THE SEVERITY OF THIS PROBLEM.

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:43.718
NOW I COME TO IT AS ONE OF THE

01:28:43.785 --> 01:28:44.919
BUDGET CHAIRS AND I KNOW I'M

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:47.722
STEPPING OUT OF MY JURISDICTION.

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:48.656
BUT ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:51.426
MULTITUDES OF PROPOSALS BEFORE

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:53.261
US THAT ARE EXPENSIVE BUT IF WE

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:55.196
CAN'T START WITH THE BASICS OF

01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:56.964
CLEAN DRINKING WATER AS A HUMAN

01:28:57.031 --> 01:28:58.499
RIGHT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:00.001
IT'S AWFULLY HARD FOR ME TO

01:29:00.068 --> 01:29:01.369
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN KEEP.

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:03.304
HEALTH FOR ALL OF OUR

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:05.173
COMMUNITIES A PRIORITY AS WELL.

01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:07.475
SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHETHER A

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:08.643
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION GETS

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:10.611
US UP TO SPEED FAST ENOUGH OR

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:13.081
WOULD A ONE TIME INVESTMENT IF

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:14.582
THE LEGISLATURE WAS WILLING.

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:17.018
HELP TO ASSIST IN ADDRESSING THE

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:19.721
CRISIS THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE WE

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:21.355
HAVE TODAY.

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:22.724
ASSEMBLYMEMBER I'LL TAKE A SHOT --

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:23.791
AND JUST FIRST OF ALL ON

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:25.393
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE I THINK

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.128
THAT'S ARE ONE OF THOSE RARE

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.796
ISSUES IN WATER POLICY WHERE

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:30.765
EVERYONE AGREES LET'S CAPTURE AS

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.200
MUCH OF THAT WINTER RAIN.

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:33.468
GET INTO GROUNDWATER BASINS

01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:35.136
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE IMPACTS

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.370
OF IMPLEMENTING THIS IS DOUBLE

01:29:36.437 --> 01:29:37.972
GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT SO

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.173
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.708
ON THAT --

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:42.043
I'LL SAY REGARDING THE COST

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.377
ESTIMATE OF A HUNDRED FORTY

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.346
MILLION DOLLARS WE DO BELIEVE

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:47.482
THAT IT CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:48.983
WHAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT THE

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.685
SOLUTION IS IT'S NOT THAT

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:51.753
EXPENSIVE.

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:53.087
THESE ARE OFF THE SHELF

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:55.990
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECH IN A

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:57.959
DEVELOPED AND REFINED OVER TIME

01:29:58.025 --> 01:29:59.627
AND COST IS COME DOWN --

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:01.429
SO IT'S NOT LIKE --

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:02.930
YOU KNOW FINDING A TECH YOU KNOW

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:04.132
A TERRIBLY TECHNICALLY

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:05.433
TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT YOU KNOW

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.834
SOLUTION IN EVERY COMMUNITY IT'S

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.536
SIMPLY BRINGING THE TECHNOLOGY

01:30:08.603 --> 01:30:10.338
IN AN OPERATING THE TECHNOLOGY.

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:11.672
I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITH A ONE

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:14.008
TIME FUNDING IS AGAIN THAT I'M

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:16.344
GOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE --

01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:17.512
THE BONDS THANKS TO THE

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:18.513
LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:20.448
HAVE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:22.183
ESTABLISHING ONE TIME FUNDING --

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.851
AS RECENTLY AS PROP SIXTY EIGHT

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:24.752
IN JUNE --

01:30:24.819 --> 01:30:26.053
WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS AT A

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:30.491
LOOSE OF ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE?

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.727
IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR A

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:34.762
HYBRID OF THESE TWO SOLUTIONS AS

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.531
WE GO THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS AND

01:30:36.597 --> 01:30:37.965
I'M JUST TRYING.

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:39.801
AT SOME POINTS TO GAIN THE

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:42.370
INFORMATION AND AND LOOK IT'S

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:44.305
IT'S IT'S HARD WHEN WE HAVE THE

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:46.541
SURPLUS THAT WE DO NOT TO WANT

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:48.643
TO SPEND IT ON THINGS THAT WE

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:49.977
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPENDING IT ON

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:51.479
IN THE PAST.

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:53.147
AND SOI THINK THERE'S AN

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:55.516
OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:58.019
MUCH WE COULD DO WITHIN ONE TIME

01:30:58.085 --> 01:30:59.854
WHILE ALSO LOOKING TOWARDS WHAT

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:01.622
WE NEED TO DO TO HAVE THE SAFE

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:04.025
AND RELIABLE ON GOING SPENDING

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:05.726
THAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING AND SO.

01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:07.695
I JUST WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.730
IN MEMBERSHIP DOES THINK ABOUT A

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:11.732
HYBRID MODEL THAT ALLOWS US. TO

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.367
CONSIDER ALL OPTIONS BEFORE US

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:15.503
SO THAT WE CAN GET A DEAL DONE

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:16.270
THIS YEAR [inaudible]

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:18.973
THANK YOU.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.641
THANK YOU --

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:24.045
IS PRESSES NEXT.

01:31:24.111 --> 01:31:26.881
I JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT --

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:28.816
THE CHAIRS --

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:30.318
FOR BRINGING TO US EXPERTS THAT

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.719
INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY.

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:33.054
I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.889
IMPORTANT WHEN WE WERE TALKING

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:36.657
ABOUT --

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:38.292
WATER TALKING ABOUT CLEAN

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:39.527
DRINKING WATER BEING A HUMAN

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:40.695
RIGHT.

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:43.631
THAT WE INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:46.534
KING THE WATER THAT IS NOT CLEAN

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:47.435
AND DRINKABLE.

01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:48.336
SO -- SO SON

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:49.370
ON THEM THAT.

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:50.605
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.106
PART OF THIS PANEL AND THAT YOUR

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:54.175
VOICE IS HERE REPRESENTING THE

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:55.676
COMMUNITY AND I APPRECIATE VERY

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:59.947
MUCH THAT THE COMMUNITIES HERE

01:32:00.014 --> 01:32:04.418
IN BENITO SUBTLE SYSTEM THIS

01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:04.719
[inaudible]

01:32:04.785 --> 01:32:05.186
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:05.920
GARCIA.

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:08.422
MY QUESTION IS IN REGARDS.

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:10.591
TO HOW WE ANTICIPATE TO

01:32:10.658 --> 01:32:12.827
PRIORITIZE --

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:15.529
THE REGION'S SEVERITY OF THE

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:19.533
PROBLEMS AND I KNOW THAT MAYBE

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.503
HORSE BUT IF IF WE ARE LOOKING

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:25.473
AT THE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY --

01:32:25.539 --> 01:32:27.208
THAT WERE --

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:30.711
ATTEMPTING TO TO SECURE HERE --

01:32:30.778 --> 01:32:32.146
WHETHER IT BE THROUGH MISTER

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:33.848
BONDING STAFFORD TORY

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:35.249
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT --

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:36.517
HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:38.886
PRIORITIZING --

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:39.954
THE PROBLEM [inaudible]

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:45.960
THE IF YOU I WELL I'LL TAKE A

01:32:46.027 --> 01:32:47.395
FIRST CRACK YOU KNOW I THINK --

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:50.064
OBVIOUSLY THE SYSTEMS OUT OF

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:51.232
COMPLIANCE ARE KIND OF THE BLADE

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:52.800
FROM BIG BLINKING RED DOTS BUT I

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:53.935
THINK YOUR POINT.

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.336
YOU KNOW THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT I

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:57.271
THINK WILL HELP PROVIDE --

01:32:57.338 --> 01:32:58.906
SORT OF A A SCAFFOLDING IF YOU

01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:01.108
WILL OF ASSESSING NEAR WHERE THE

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.476
PRIORITY SHOULD BE AGAIN.

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:03.811
SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE THAT'S

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:05.112
EASY ONE BUT IT'S REALLY THE

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:07.148
SYSTEMS THAT ARE OR CLOSE TO IT

01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:08.249
TO BEING OUT OF COMPLIANCE THAT

01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:09.750
ARE YOU KNOW ONE ONE PROBLEM THE

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:10.952
WAY THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO

01:33:11.018 --> 01:33:12.053
IDENTIFY.

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.421
BEGIN TO ADDRESS PRIOR TO THEY

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:14.488
GET THERE AND SO I THINK THE

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:16.190
NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL CONTINUE

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:19.093
TO ON EARTH --

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:19.727
A LOT OF WHAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:23.331
MAY LOW OVERLAY DATA AND REALLY

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:25.032
BEGIN TO ZERO IN ON ON WHERE

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.068
EXACTLY IT IS THAT YOU NEED --

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:27.935
TO TO FOCUS IN ON PERSON OFF AND

01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:31.539
AGAIN THE OBVIOUS ARE ARE THE

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:32.139
BIG SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE

01:33:32.206 --> 01:33:35.209
BUT AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT --

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:36.510
GOVERNOR BROWN THE LEGISLATURE

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:38.479
SUPPORTED THE MOVE THAT THE MOVE

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:39.780
OF THAT DIVISION OF DRINKING

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.582
WATER FROM THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC

01:33:41.649 --> 01:33:42.984
HEALTH TO THE WATER BOARD --

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:44.218
SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THAT WAS A

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:45.987
HUGE STEP TO SORT OF BREAK DOWN

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:47.355
FRAGMENTATION ON THIS ISSUE.

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.090
I'M SO WE DO HAVE A DIVISION OF

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:50.257
DRINKING WATER AT THE WATER

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:51.258
BOARD AND DURING PAHLAVAS WHO

01:33:51.325 --> 01:33:52.827
LEADS THAT IS ACTUALLY HERE

01:33:57.565 --> 01:33:57.999
AND PART OF HIS JOB IS

01:33:58.065 --> 01:33:59.567
UNDERSTANDING SPECIFICALLY HOW

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:02.536
WE PUT TO WORK THE RESOURCES

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:03.204

I'M DEBORAH AMOS DEPUTY DIRECTOR

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:22.223
FOR THE DIVISION A DRINKING

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:23.991
WATER IT STATE WATER BOARD --

01:34:24.058 --> 01:34:25.393
TO QUESTION PRIORITIZATION IS IS

01:34:25.459 --> 01:34:27.194
ALWAYS A TRICKY --

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:28.696
ONE AS A FORMER RISK OF ALL SAID

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:29.697
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO START WHERE

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:31.432
WE KNOW THE WATER.

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:34.168
SYSTEMS ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:35.603
AND AYE I THINK KIND OF THE MOST

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:37.104
IMPORTANT PART TO REALIZE IT WE

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:38.272
WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO FIND

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:39.273
FISSIONS HIS FIRST.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.342
THIS FUNDING THAT WE'RE

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:44.145
PROPOSING TO DO IS NOT ALL ON IN

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:46.080
ADDITION OPERATION OF SYSTEMS

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:46.747
NOW SO.

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:47.882
A LOT OF THE EARLY WORK WE PLAN

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:48.983
TO DO WILL GO INTO

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:50.418
CONSOLIDATIONS.

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:51.152
ARGAN MINISTRY --

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:52.953
IS TO TRY TO OF HELP SYSTEMS

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.188
UNDERSTAND THEIR TECHNICAL

01:34:54.255 --> 01:34:55.823
PROBLEMS AND REALLY GET A GRASP

01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:57.291
OF WHERE THAT'S AT AND THEN WE

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:58.759
YOU KNOW PLANNED OVERTIME MORE

01:34:58.826 --> 01:35:00.194
FAT INTO THEN THE EXISTING

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:01.862
PROBLEMS THAT STAND SO.

01:35:01.929 --> 01:35:03.464
IT'LL BE A MOVING TARGET AND THE

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:04.565
BEAUTY OF THE OF THE DRINKING

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:05.833
WATER BEING AT THE WATER BOARD I

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.168
WAS IT DOES PRODUCE DISSIPATION

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:08.502
DISCUSSIONS GET TO COME BEFORE

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:09.603
THE BOARD IN A PUBLIC FORUM SO

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:10.871
THAT WE GET TO ADJUST.

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:12.540
ON THE FLY AS WE CONTINUE TO

01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:14.108
MOVE ON IT AND I I REALIZE HOW

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:15.676
OF COMPLICATE THIS COULD BE

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:16.444
RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:18.612
THIS ON THIS LIKE A COMPETITION

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:21.515
OF WHO'S GOT THE DIRTIEST WATER

01:35:21.582 --> 01:35:22.783
WILL GO FIRST.

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:24.752
RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT IT

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:26.087
BOILS DOWN TO AND THEN WE BEGIN

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:27.822
TO INVEST IN THOSE AREAS.

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:29.924
HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT INTO

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:32.226
HOW AS WERE PRIORITIZING THESE

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:34.395
AREAS WITH THE RED DOTS.

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:35.429
HOW MONEY COMING FROM THOSE

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:38.466
AREAS CAN GO BACK TO THOSE AREAS?

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:41.402
GIVING BOTH RATE PAYERS --

01:35:41.469 --> 01:35:43.571
WATER AGENCIES AND OTHER

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:46.740
STAKEHOLDERS THE CERTAINTY RIGHT

01:35:46.807 --> 01:35:48.209
THAT MONEY'S GOING BACK TO THOSE

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:49.443
REGIONS TO ADDRESSING THIS

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:50.845
PROBLEM I WILL.

01:35:50.911 --> 01:35:52.246
I WILL SAY OR GIVE THE

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:53.481
COMPARISON.

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:56.550
I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY.

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:57.618
THE TWELFTH AN INCREASE ON

01:35:57.685 --> 01:36:00.921
GASOLINE FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENTS --

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:03.491
SURVIVED IT'S YOU KNOW TEST IN

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:07.228
NOVEMBER WAS BECAUSE THESE

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:09.363
REGIONS OF THE STATE ARE.

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:10.965
WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE USE

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:12.800
OF THOSE DOLLARS IMMEDIATELY.

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.602
RIGHT AND SO IS THERE.

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:15.302
A THOUGHT BEHIND HOW WE

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:18.739
IMMEDIATELY THESE INVESTMENTS TO

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:21.142
THESE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE SEE THE

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.209
MONEY THAT THEY'RE SENDING TO

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:25.179
SACRAMENTO OR MAYBE NOT --

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:28.382
STAYING THERE LOCALLY TO ADDRESS --

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:31.152
THE CLEAN WATER ISSUES IN THEIR

01:36:31.218 --> 01:36:31.318
OWN.

01:36:31.385 --> 01:36:34.121
BACKYARD.

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:35.556
WELL I'LL JUST SAY FIRST OF ALL

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:36.757
OF THE SORT OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.058
I THINK GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS BEEN

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.994
VERY CLEAR THAT HE WELCOMES ALL

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.629
THE IDEAS ON HOW WE SOLVE THIS

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:43.430
PROBLEM AS LONG AS WE FOCUS ON

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:44.765
SOLVING THE PROBLEM.

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:46.300
SO -- CHAIR --

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:48.302
GARCIA'S I THINK YOUR

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:49.770
IDENTIFYING IS THE POSSIBILITY

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:51.238
OF ESSENTIALLY KIND OF REGIONAL

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:52.506
LIES IN THE COLLECTION

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:55.009
APPLICATIONS OF OF OF OF THESE

01:36:55.075 --> 01:36:57.077
FUNDS -- SO

01:36:57.144 --> 01:36:58.112
THAT --

01:36:58.179 --> 01:36:59.813
FUNDING COLLECTED THROUGH FEE

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.482
TAX IN ONE REGION'S OR TO STAYS

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:02.917
IN THE REGION TO WORK ON CLEAN

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:04.885
AND SAFE DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS --

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:05.786
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'VE

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:07.721
DELVED INTO IN GREAT DETAIL BUT

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:09.957
IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:11.859
CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS THAT WE

01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:13.027
SHOULD THINK THROW.

01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:14.762
I I ASKED THE QUESTION BECAUSE

01:37:14.828 --> 01:37:17.231
IN LAST YEAR'S DELIBERATIONS.

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:19.767
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:20.734
CONCERN.

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:24.438
RIGHT THAT THERE WAS A BIG FOCUS

01:37:24.505 --> 01:37:26.106
ON OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE

01:37:26.173 --> 01:37:29.376
CENTRAL AREA SALINAS VALLEY --

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:31.345
AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:32.346
THE WORD WAS BEING USED

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.615
EQUITABLE WAY OF DISTRIBUTING

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.016
THE RESOURCES TO THESE AREAS

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:38.452
WHERE WE SEE THE RED DOTS --

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:40.187
WAS ONE FACTOR I THINK THAT GAVE

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:41.589
PEOPLE SOME RESERVATIONS

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:44.658
PARTICULARLY WATER AGENCIES --

01:37:44.725 --> 01:37:45.626
WHO WERE BEING GIVEN THE

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:47.127
RESPONSIBILITY OF COLLECTING

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:48.963
THIS MONEY SENDING IT UP AND

01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:50.097
MAYBE NEVER?

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:52.032
SEEN IT AGAIN.

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:53.234
I THINK THAT'S A FAIR POINT I

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.002
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WATER

01:37:55.069 --> 01:37:56.370
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE

01:37:56.437 --> 01:37:57.972
HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN FUNDED BY

01:37:58.038 --> 01:37:59.473
STATEWIDE BONDS.

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.307
WHERE WE'RE ESSENTIALLY

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:03.310
INDICTING OURSELVES AND OUR KIDS --

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:04.979
TO FIND INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:06.714
AND SO IN TERMS OF THIS QUESTION

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.249
OF RATE SHAFT JUST REST ASSURED

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:10.284
THERE'S PLENTY OF FUNDING THAT'S

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:11.685
GONE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.654
COACHELLA. TWO URBAN WATER

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:16.023
DISTRICTS TO FIND IN THE

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:17.358
FACILITIES ARE STORM WATER

01:38:17.424 --> 01:38:18.325
CAPTURE.

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:19.960
SO I ALWAYS I ALWAYS CAUTION

01:38:20.027 --> 01:38:21.161
PEOPLE TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:22.263
CAREFUL ON THIS QUESTION OF OF

01:38:22.329 --> 01:38:23.297
RATE SHIPPED UNLESS YOU REALLY

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:25.599
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING --

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:26.967
QUESTION MORE HOLISTICALLY WE

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:29.270
GET WE GET IT.

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:31.038
RIGHT -- WE

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:32.406
HARDLY UNDERSTAND THAT --

01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:33.941
ON THE GROUND.

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:35.943
RIGHT IT'S WE WHO HAVE TO GO

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:38.879
BACK AND SAY WE SUPPORTED THIS

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:39.813
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA DO THAT.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.283
AND NOT.

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:44.051
ULTIMATELY SEE THAT HAPPEN RIGHT

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:45.052
SO I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF PUT

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:46.353
THAT -- ON

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.155
THE TABLE AND THAT IS CERTAINLY

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:49.890
SOMETHING OF MUCH INTEREST TO ME

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:51.625
AND I DO ARE JUST OF KNOWLEDGE

01:38:51.692 --> 01:38:52.726
AND RECOGNIZE THE NEED

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.328
COMMITMENT FROM MY COLLEAGUE

01:38:54.395 --> 01:38:55.663
FROM PORTER AVAILABLE IS ALSO.

01:38:55.729 --> 01:38:57.231
PUT FORWARD A CONCEPT.

01:38:57.298 --> 01:38:59.066
RIGHT A CONCEPT THAT REALLY TIES

01:38:59.133 --> 01:39:01.302
OUR HANDS TO THIS GUY.

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:03.070
COMMITMENT WE'VE MADE TO THE

01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:04.672
HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER.

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:07.174
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IT WOULD

01:39:07.241 --> 01:39:07.908
GET.

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:09.343
YOU KNOW IT'S DAY IN COURT AND

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:11.979
AND AND REALLY BAD OUT THAT THE

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:12.513
IDEA THAT IF WE'RE TRULY

01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:13.480
COMMITTED.

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:15.316
THAT WE'RE MAKING A LONG TERM

01:39:15.382 --> 01:39:18.018
COMMITMENT AS IN CALIFORNIA

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:20.354
WHERE X. AMOUNT OF MONEY EVERY

01:39:20.421 --> 01:39:22.089
SINGLE YEAR WHETHER IT'S THERE.

01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:24.625
OR NOT IT THERE IS A COMMITMENT

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.593
THAT GOES TOWARDS FUNDING --

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:28.529
OUR PRIORITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:39:28.595 --> 01:39:30.731
AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A PRIORITY

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.199
I MEAN GIVEN --

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:33.667
THE COMMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE

01:39:33.734 --> 01:39:34.702
THE COMMITMENT THAT THE

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:36.470
ADMINISTRATION IS MADE --

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:38.305
AND CLEARLY THE PARTICIPATION

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:40.007
TODAY AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.241
THERE IS SOME SERIOUS

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:43.577
CONSIDERATION. TO VETTING THAT

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:43.944
OUT [inaudible]

01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:47.414
THANK YOU.

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:48.382
IT SURE QUIRK I THINK OF A

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:49.283
FOLLOW UP YES --

01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:51.452
SO MY CONCERN IF YOU LOOK AT

01:39:51.518 --> 01:39:52.786
WHERE THESE STOCKS ARE.

01:39:52.853 --> 01:39:54.922
THIS IS A TRANSFER OF MONEY FROM

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:56.523
THE URBAN AREAS TO THE RURAL

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:58.926
AREAS IF YOU MAKE IT REGIONAL.

01:39:58.992 --> 01:40:00.594
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY MONEY

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:04.765
FOR THE RURAL AREAS TO SPEAK UP.

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:05.399
SO I THINK IT'S A TERRIBLE LIFE

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:06.367
T. --

01:40:06.433 --> 01:40:08.502
BECAUSE MY DISTRICT HAS NOTHING

01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:10.537
OUT OF COMPLIANCE NEITHER.

01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:11.805
I WILL SAY THIS.

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:14.007
THERE IS A PROBLEM.

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:15.909
JUST NORTH OF MY DISTRICT IN

01:40:15.976 --> 01:40:18.011
OAKLAND WITH LEAD PIPES WITH

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:20.080
PIPE LED COMING FROM PIPES NONE

01:40:20.147 --> 01:40:21.448
OF THAT MONEY WOULD GO TO THAT.

01:40:21.515 --> 01:40:23.117
AND YET I'M WILLING TO BET THAT

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:24.818
MR BONTA WHO REPRESENTS THAT

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:27.187
DISTRICT WOULD BE WILLING TO

01:40:27.254 --> 01:40:29.022
TRANSFER THAT MONEY TO YOUR

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:30.190
DISTRICT WHICH DOES HAVE THIS

01:40:30.257 --> 01:40:31.959
PROBLEM SO I JUST DON'T THINK

01:40:32.025 --> 01:40:33.260
THE REGIONALIZATION.

01:40:33.327 --> 01:40:34.795
WORKS AT ALL I CAN PRETTY MUCH

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:36.997
GUARANTEE THAT ANY MONEY COMING

01:40:37.064 --> 01:40:38.966
OUT OF YOUR REGION WILL BE MORE

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:40.701
THAN MATCHED WITH MONEY COMING

01:40:40.768 --> 01:40:42.069
OUT OF THE URBAN AREAS.

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:43.670
AND I THINK YOU COULD SELL IT TO

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:46.640
YOUR REGION'S FOR THAT PURPOSE

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:48.809
THAT THIS IS BY AND LARGE THE

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:51.412
URBAN RICHER AREAS SUBSIDIZING

01:40:51.478 --> 01:40:54.214
THE POOR OLD POOR RURAL AREAS.

01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:55.883
FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES AND I

01:40:55.949 --> 01:40:58.585
THINK WE CAN GET THE VOTES OUT

01:40:58.652 --> 01:41:01.088
OF THE URBAN AREAS.

01:41:01.155 --> 01:41:03.090

MISS DAN THIS WELL --

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:17.998
QUESTION OF RELYING ON THE

01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:20.334
GENERAL FUND --

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:24.271
AS EITHER AN ALTERNATIVE TO

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:25.706
LOOKING TO RATE PAYERS OR AG

01:42:25.772 --> 01:42:29.743
FEES OR IN ADDITION --

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.712
TO MR CROWFOOT DID DESCRIBE THE

01:42:31.778 --> 01:42:33.647
IMPORTANCE OF PREDICTABILITY IN

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:35.249
REVENUE FOR THE PURPOSE OF

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:36.917
CONTRACTING FOR LONG TERM

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:39.319
SOLUTIONS AND I JUST WANT TO BE

01:42:39.386 --> 01:42:39.786
EXPLICIT.

01:42:39.853 --> 01:42:41.588
THAT.

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:43.056
WE ARE WE HAVE A HELP THE

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:46.226
GENERAL FUND IN A SURPLUS NOW.

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:48.028
BUT I'LL REMIND YOU WERE NINE

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:49.897
YEARS OUT IN OUR ECONOMIC

01:42:49.963 --> 01:42:52.099
RECOVERY FROM THE RECESSION IF

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:54.434
YOU LOOK RETROSPECTIVELY.

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:56.336
NO ECONOMIC GROWTH CARRIED HIS

01:42:56.403 --> 01:42:57.871
EVER EXCEEDED SEVEN YEARS FOR

01:42:57.938 --> 01:43:00.007
THE AVERAGE IS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS

01:43:00.073 --> 01:43:02.509
SO WE'RE TWO YEARS BEYOND THAT.

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:05.078
AHEAD OF US WE DON'T KNOW WHEN.

01:43:05.145 --> 01:43:07.180
BUT WE CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY

01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:08.649
THERE WILL BE A DIP.

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:10.183
OR A DROP.

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:12.019
IN THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE

01:43:12.085 --> 01:43:14.087
STRAPPED TO MAINTAIN ONGOING

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:16.857
OBLIGATIONS TO EDUCATION TO

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:18.358
HEALTHCARE.

01:43:18.425 --> 01:43:20.360
IT CETERA IN IF WE RELY UPON A

01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:23.564
GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION EACH

01:43:23.630 --> 01:43:24.932
YEAR TO MEET.

01:43:24.998 --> 01:43:28.168
THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS IT'S IT'S

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:29.469
TOO MUCH OF A CRAPSHOOT THAT'S

01:43:29.536 --> 01:43:31.705
WHY WE LOOK TO A GUARANTEED

01:43:31.772 --> 01:43:34.341
PREDICTABLE REVENUE SOURCE THAT

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:36.443
REGARDLESS.

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:37.678
OF ECONOMIC.

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:40.080
EXIGENCIES IN OUR BUDGET WE

01:43:40.147 --> 01:43:42.482
STILL HAVE A PREDICTABLE SOURCE

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:44.685
AND ALSO TO ADD ON TO WHAT MR

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:46.520
CROWFOOT SAID --

01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:48.789
WE USE BONTA MONEY FOR FOR

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:51.224
CERTAIN CAPITAL PROJECTS AND WE

01:43:51.291 --> 01:43:53.193
PASS THE INTEREST PAYMENTS WE

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.963
ALL PAY THE INTEREST ON THAT.

01:43:56.029 --> 01:43:58.098
THIS IS A DIRECT FUNDING SOURCE

01:43:58.165 --> 01:43:59.733
THAT.

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.101
THE MONEY COMES IN GETS

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:04.037
ALLOCATED AND SPENT IN WERE NOT

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:05.405
INCURRING DEBT.

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:07.841
IN THIS CURRENT STRUCTURE SO --

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:09.509
I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:10.444
AGAIN --

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:12.279
DOCTOR RUMBLE RAISE THE QUESTION

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:13.747
MAY BE LOOKING AT SOME CAPITAL

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:15.115
INFUSION.

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:18.385
UP FRONT FROM THE GENERAL FUND

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:20.687
IN ALL CREATIVE IDEAS BUT I I

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:23.457
WILL CONTINUE TO ARGUE FOR THE

01:44:23.523 --> 01:44:26.226
IMPORTANCE OF A PREDICTABLE LONG

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:28.629
TERM REVENUE SOURCE THAT'S NOT

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:30.897
LINKED TO OUR GENERAL FUND AND I

01:44:30.964 --> 01:44:32.299
DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:34.134
THAT IF I BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR.

01:44:34.201 --> 01:44:35.469
ECHOES THAT --

01:44:35.535 --> 01:44:37.671
PRIORITIZATION AS WELL IN EITHER

01:44:37.738 --> 01:44:38.905
MISTER CRAWFORD --

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:39.873

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:42.275
COMMENT YEAH I'LL JUST SAY AT

01:44:42.342 --> 01:44:43.210
THE END OF THE DAY.

01:44:43.276 --> 01:44:44.011
WELL COLLECTIVELY FOCUSED ON

01:44:44.077 --> 01:44:46.179
SOLVING THE PROBLEM AND AS WE GO --

01:44:46.246 --> 01:44:47.648
AS WE'VE GONE OUT THERE AND TRY

01:44:47.714 --> 01:44:49.349
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOR THE

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:51.051
FUNDING THAT'S NEEDED --

01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:52.653
WHAT WE'VE UNDERSTOOD IS TO

01:44:52.719 --> 01:44:54.921
OPERATE AND MAKE AND MAINTAIN

01:44:54.988 --> 01:44:56.623
THIS TECHNOLOGY YOU YOU NEED I'M

01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:57.924
GOING FUNDING SOURCE AND IT

01:44:57.991 --> 01:44:59.359
WOULDN'T WORK TO HAVE A CHUNK

01:44:59.426 --> 01:45:01.028
HERE A CHUNK THERE SKIP A YEAR

01:45:01.094 --> 01:45:02.963
ANOTHER CHUNK THERE --

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:05.532
IF SOMEBODY CAN PROVE OTHERWISE --

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.367
THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD BECAUSE

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:09.102
AND IF IT CAN WORK --

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:10.137
THAT WOULD BE OF COURSE

01:45:10.203 --> 01:45:11.872
EXCELLENT BUT ALL OF THE

01:45:11.938 --> 01:45:13.507
CONVERSATION THAT HAVE TAKEN

01:45:13.573 --> 01:45:14.875
PLACE THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

01:45:14.941 --> 01:45:16.877
NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO TO TO

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:17.344
REALLY MAKE THAT CASE

01:45:17.411 --> 01:45:18.512

THINK THAT THE GENERAL FUND IS

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:25.052
UNRELIABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE.

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:26.987
AND TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE WE NEED

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:28.488
A SUSTAINABLE SOURCES PERMANENT.

01:45:28.555 --> 01:45:30.824
TO ENSURE THAT WE SOLVE THIS

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:33.527
PROBLEM SO WE REALLY DO WE CAN

01:45:33.593 --> 01:45:34.628
RELY ON A PERMANENT SOURCE OF

01:45:34.695 --> 01:45:35.796
FUNDING TO ALLOW US TO HAVE THE

01:45:35.862 --> 01:45:37.531

THAT PROVIDES WATER TO THE CITY

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:42.983

01:48:43.049 --> 01:48:44.384

OF THIS ISSUE IN OUR REGION I

01:48:52.525 --> 01:48:53.994
THINK WHEN WE ALL HERE ABOUT THE

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:55.829
COACHELLA VALLEY.

01:48:55.896 --> 01:48:57.163
SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE KIND

01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:58.732
OF PUT IN OUR MIND IS.

01:48:58.798 --> 01:49:00.567
THE MUSIC FESTIVAL.

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:02.002
THE AMOUNT OF GOLF COURSES THAT

01:49:02.068 --> 01:49:03.770
WE HAVE TO RESORT LIFE.

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:05.672
AND AND THAT'S A VERY REAL BUT

01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:08.241
WE ALSO HAVE A REAL VERY REAL --

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:10.210
WATER.

01:49:10.277 --> 01:49:12.245
ISSUE IN OUR REGION THAT I THINK

01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:13.780
A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:49:13.847 --> 01:49:15.348
SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA

01:49:15.415 --> 01:49:15.782
TRY TO PAY FOR YOU.

01:49:15.849 --> 01:49:17.317
TODAY.

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:19.085
OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY IS MADE

01:49:19.152 --> 01:49:21.688
UP OF FIVE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES.

01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:22.222
THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER

01:49:22.289 --> 01:49:23.690
DISTRICT.

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:26.259
<u>&lt;c.red&gt;S BY FAR THE LARGEST.&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:49:26.326 --> 01:49:27.894
OF THESE AGENCIES.

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:28.461
COVERING MOST OF THE VALLEY

01:49:28.528 --> 01:49:29.396
FLOOR [inaudible]

01:49:29.462 --> 01:49:31.197
WITHOUT.

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:32.666
THE SERVICE AREA OF OVER A

01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:35.669
THOUSAND SQUARE MILES.

01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:37.671
WE HAVE OVER JUST THE COACHELLA

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:40.473
VALLEY WATER DISTRICT HAS OVER

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:41.041
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SERVICE

01:49:41.107 --> 01:49:43.677
CONNECTIONS.

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:44.477
HALF OF THE HALF OF THE

01:49:44.544 --> 01:49:45.412
COACHELLA VALLEY [inaudible]

01:49:45.478 --> 01:49:49.082
IS RURAL.

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:50.450
HALF OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY'S

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:51.885
ARE NOT ON A CORPORATION.

01:49:51.952 --> 01:49:54.354
FULL OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS.

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:58.224
THAT ARE TENDED.

01:49:58.291 --> 01:50:00.393
MAINLY BY FOLKS THAT LIVE WITHIN

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:02.595
THESE THESE AGRICULTURAL FIELDS

01:50:02.662 --> 01:50:02.896
[inaudible]

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:07.767
AND THIS IS REALLY THE AREA

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:09.703
WHERE WE HAVE THE ISSUE.

01:50:09.769 --> 01:50:11.471
SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT

01:50:11.538 --> 01:50:15.108
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FOCUS ON

01:50:15.175 --> 01:50:15.809
TO UNDERSTAND THE COACHELLA

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:17.110
VALLEY YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT A

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:18.578
100% OF OUR WATER SUPPLY FOR

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:20.180
DRINKING PURPOSES [inaudible]

01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:23.116
IS GROUNDWATER.

01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:26.286
OUR WATER QUALITY VARIES ACROSS

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:28.088
THE AQUIFER FLOOR.

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:29.756
AND PRIMARILY WHERE WE HAVE A

01:50:29.823 --> 01:50:31.424
RACE USED ARE IN THE RURAL AREAS

01:50:31.491 --> 01:50:32.392
WHERE WE HAVE NATURALLY

01:50:32.459 --> 01:50:33.793
OCCURRING ARSENIC.

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:35.161
NATURALLY OCCURRING FLUORIDE

01:50:35.228 --> 01:50:37.197
NATURALLY OCCURRING NITRATES.

01:50:37.263 --> 01:50:38.531
AND EVEN THOUGH THE CHROMIUM SIX

01:50:38.598 --> 01:50:40.400
ISSUE KIND OF HAS GONE AWAY FOR

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:41.601
AWHILE NOW.

01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:43.603
BUT IF IT COMES BACK IT'LL BE

01:50:43.670 --> 01:50:44.237
ONE MORE ISSUE THAT WILL HAVE TO

01:50:44.304 --> 01:50:46.506
DEAL WITH --

01:50:46.573 --> 01:50:47.741
TO GIVE YOU SOME REFERENCE OF

01:50:47.807 --> 01:50:48.608
HOW THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT OUR

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:49.542
REGION.

01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:50.677
AND PROBABLY THROW MORE

01:50:50.744 --> 01:50:52.779
COMPLEXITY INTO THIS DISCUSSION

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:56.349
OF AFFORDABILITY OF WATER.

01:50:56.416 --> 01:50:57.317
OUR AGENCY THE COACHELLA VALLEY

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:58.918
WATER DISTRICT WAS THE LARGEST

01:50:58.985 --> 01:50:59.953
AGENCY IN THE STATE OF

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.054
CALIFORNIA THAT WAS GOING TO BE

01:51:01.121 --> 01:51:02.689
IMPACTED FINANCIALLY BY THIS NEW

01:51:02.756 --> 01:51:04.891
MCL.

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:06.259
THE COULD HAVE ANY WATER

01:51:06.326 --> 01:51:07.093
DISTRICT HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:07.961
WELLS.

01:51:08.028 --> 01:51:10.897
AND A THIRD OF THOSE LAWS ABOUT.

01:51:10.964 --> 01:51:12.232
THIRTY THREE AT HIGHER LEVELS

01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:13.733
THAN WHAT THE NEW MC OUT WAS

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.502
PROPOSING SO THAT WAS YOU KNOW

01:51:15.568 --> 01:51:17.237
WE WERE PRETTY CLEAR PROJECTING

01:51:17.303 --> 01:51:18.805
THAT WE WE HAD TO IMPLEMENT --

01:51:18.872 --> 01:51:19.873
SOME SORT OF PROJECT THAT WAS

01:51:19.939 --> 01:51:21.341
GONNA BE IN THE TUNE OF TWO

01:51:21.408 --> 01:51:22.675
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:25.145
SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE.

01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:26.479
OF HOW.

01:51:26.546 --> 01:51:29.115
THE AFFORDABILITY QUESTION.

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:30.917
WHAT WHAT WHAT CREATE ANOTHER

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:32.652
ISSUE FOR OUR REGION BEING THAT?

01:51:32.719 --> 01:51:33.920
THAT THAT THAT THAT OUR REGION

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:35.755
IS IS IS THE LARGEST AGENCY

01:51:35.822 --> 01:51:36.890
IMPACTED BY THIS NEWMAN SIAPA

01:51:36.956 --> 01:51:39.025
COMES BACK.

01:51:39.092 --> 01:51:40.427
BUT I THINK WE SAW A MAP HERE

01:51:40.493 --> 01:51:42.796
WITH -- WITH

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:43.930
THE WATER SYSTEMS THAT WERE OUT

01:51:43.997 --> 01:51:45.432
OF COMPLIANCE THOSE THOSE WERE

01:51:45.498 --> 01:51:48.301
THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS --

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.303
AGAIN THE COACHELLA VALLEY IS

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.938
MADE UP OF FIVE PUBLIC WATER

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:53.807
SYSTEMS BUT WE HAVE HUNDREDS.

01:51:53.873 --> 01:51:55.542
OF STATE SMALL SYSTEMS.

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:56.843
THE FIVE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:59.045
IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY.

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:01.081
ARE IN COMPLIANCE THEY HAVE THE

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:02.782
RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:04.517
SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER.

01:52:04.584 --> 01:52:06.653
OUR ISSUES WITH THE STATE.

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:08.855
SMALL WATER SYSTMS IF IF IF WE

01:52:08.922 --> 01:52:10.223
IF I HAD ANOTHER BOARD HERE.

01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:12.225
AND I COULD PUT IT.

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:13.927
UP THERE IN ANYWAY JUST IT WOULD

01:52:13.993 --> 01:52:15.095
JUST FOCUS ON EASTER COACHELLA

01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:16.629
VALLEY YOU WOULD HAVE THE EXACT

01:52:16.696 --> 01:52:17.964
SAME NUMBER DOCTOR MORE.

01:52:18.031 --> 01:52:20.233
SPREAD OVER THAT AREA.

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:21.634
OF ALL THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS.

01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:24.537
THERE ARE CURRENTLY --

01:52:24.604 --> 01:52:26.039
FACING THIS ISSUE.

01:52:26.106 --> 01:52:26.906
SO THAT'S SOME SORT OF VISUAL

01:52:26.973 --> 01:52:36.015
THERE -- IN

01:52:36.082 --> 01:52:37.283
IN OUR REGION WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:38.818
OVER A DECADE NOW TO ADDRESS

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:39.953
THIS ISSUE.

01:52:40.019 --> 01:52:42.088
WE FORMED IN OUR REGION --

01:52:42.155 --> 01:52:43.857
IS PART OF THE IRWIN PROGRAM.

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:45.191
A GOVERNING STRUCTURE THAT WOULD

01:52:45.258 --> 01:52:46.059
THAT WOULD KIND OF ADDRESS THESE

01:52:46.126 --> 01:52:47.927
ISSUES UNDER UNDER SOME SORT OF

01:52:47.994 --> 01:52:50.430
REGIONAL ASPECT --

01:52:50.497 --> 01:52:51.564
ME IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:52.699
TOOL FOR US WE'VE BEEN VERY

01:52:52.765 --> 01:52:54.267
SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING SOME OF

01:52:54.334 --> 01:52:55.201
THAT GRANT FUNDING.

01:52:55.268 --> 01:52:56.736
ODD THROUGH THE IRWIN PROGRAM

01:52:56.803 --> 01:52:58.505
FIRST AND PROP FIFTY DENTAL

01:52:58.571 --> 01:53:01.040
PROPERTY FOR NOW TO PROP.

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:02.575
ONE UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO

01:53:02.642 --> 01:53:04.611
MORE MONEY.

01:53:04.677 --> 01:53:05.211
THAT WE'RE GOING TO THE IRWIN

01:53:05.278 --> 01:53:05.945
PROGRAM.

01:53:06.012 --> 01:53:08.081
UP THE BOND I THINK THAT PASSED

01:53:08.148 --> 01:53:08.982
IN JUNE.

01:53:09.048 --> 01:53:10.350
HAS NO MORE MONEY ALLOCATED TO

01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:12.585
THAT PROGRAM AND THE BOND IT

01:53:12.652 --> 01:53:12.852
FAILED --

01:53:12.919 --> 01:53:14.320
LAST TIME.

01:53:14.387 --> 01:53:15.255
EVEN IF IT PASSED OUT WITH THE

01:53:15.321 --> 01:53:16.890
CAT ANY MONEY ALLOCATED TO THAT

01:53:16.956 --> 01:53:18.858
PROGRAMS WHILE AND I JUST WANT

01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:19.826
TO MENTION THAT THAT'S BEEN A

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:21.294
VERY SUSPECT SUCCESSFUL TO IN

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:22.695
OUR REGION.

01:53:22.762 --> 01:53:23.730
BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT

01:53:23.796 --> 01:53:24.030
[inaudible]

01:53:24.097 --> 01:53:26.366
THAT DOT.

01:53:26.432 --> 01:53:27.767
THAT IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT

01:53:27.834 --> 01:53:29.602
TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:30.637
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:32.539
THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED.

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:34.507
AND AND IN OUR EFFORT TO TRY TO

01:53:34.574 --> 01:53:36.876
GET THESE THESE FUNDING SOURCES

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:37.710
TO TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT

01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:39.312
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

01:53:39.379 --> 01:53:41.948
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROP?

01:53:42.015 --> 01:53:43.283
ONE OR ALL THE OTHER PROPS THAT

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:44.384
THAT PUTS MONEY INTO THESE

01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:46.219
DIFFERENT BUCKETS THERE'S A

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:47.820
BUNCH OF COMPETING PRIORITIES.

01:53:47.887 --> 01:53:49.255
RIGHT AND SO.

01:53:49.322 --> 01:53:50.623
I THINK THAT EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:51.858
AT PROP.

01:53:51.925 --> 01:53:54.360
ONE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT.

01:53:54.427 --> 01:53:57.363
OF OF OF OF WHAT PROP ONE SAYS

01:53:57.430 --> 01:54:00.867
NEEDS TO GO TO DAX IS 10%.

01:54:00.934 --> 01:54:02.235
AND SO.

01:54:02.302 --> 01:54:02.835
THAT YOU KNOW IT.

01:54:02.902 --> 01:54:03.736
THERE ARE ALL THESE POTS OF

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:05.305
MONEY BY.

01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:07.006
HOW THAT TRANSLATES INTO THE

01:54:07.073 --> 01:54:08.541
MONEY THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING DOWN

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:09.509
TO TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IS

01:54:09.576 --> 01:54:11.444
VERY MINIMAL --

01:54:11.511 --> 01:54:12.545
BECAUSE OF THE PRIORITY THAT I

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:14.047
THINK IS GIVEN TO A LOT OF OTHER

01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:16.115
THINGS LIKE CONSERVATION.

01:54:16.182 --> 01:54:17.684
SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY IT'S A

01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:18.585
VERY GOOD CONCEPT THAT WAS

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:20.053
HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH WITH

01:54:20.119 --> 01:54:21.654
A COLLEAGUE AND WE WERE TALKING

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:23.523
ABOUT THE EFFORTS OF OF STORAGE

01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:24.891
RIGHT I THINK THERE WAS ABOUT

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:26.426
SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:54:26.492 --> 01:54:28.061
IN PROP ONE FOR STORAGE.

01:54:28.127 --> 01:54:30.230
AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MONEY --

01:54:30.296 --> 01:54:32.165
PUT ASIDE FOR CONSERVATION.

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:33.700
AND OUR REGION I WOULD SAY THAT

01:54:33.766 --> 01:54:34.701
THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:54:34.767 --> 01:54:36.102
COMPETITORS IN OUR REGION BEING

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:37.403
THAT WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:38.938
GOLF COURSES WE HAVE OVER A

01:54:39.005 --> 01:54:40.273
HUNDRED AND TWENTY GOLF COURSES.

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.107
I WOULD SAY THAT A LOT OF THE

01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:42.208
MONEY THAT CAME OUT OF THOSE

01:54:42.275 --> 01:54:48.081
PROPOSITIONS PROP FIFTY PROP.

01:54:48.147 --> 01:54:49.782
SIXTY EIGHT PROP FIFTY EIGHTY

01:54:49.849 --> 01:54:52.085
FOUR AND PROP. ONE ONE OF THE

01:54:52.151 --> 01:54:53.219
BIGGEST COMPETITORS FOR THAT IS

01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:55.755
IS CONSERVATION THAT COMES IN

01:54:55.822 --> 01:54:57.457
THE FORM OF OF TURF CONVERSION.

01:54:57.523 --> 01:54:58.558
A LOT OF THAT GOES TO THE GOLF

01:54:58.625 --> 01:54:59.192
COURSES.

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.360
SO YOU KNOW THOSE I THINK WE

01:55:00.426 --> 01:55:02.795
GOTTA RETHINK THE ALREADY HERE

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:06.399
SO -- I

01:55:06.466 --> 01:55:07.300
THINK THAT THE THAT THE OTHER

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:07.967
ISSUE.

01:55:08.034 --> 01:55:10.536
IS ALSO THAT --

01:55:10.603 --> 01:55:12.105
YOU KNOW I THINK WE HEAR THE

01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:13.573
CONVERSATION ABOUT.

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.507
WELL THERE'S A READY THIS POT OF

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:16.609
MONEY THAT I THINK THERE WAS AN

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:17.977
ANALYSIS THAT SAID.

01:55:18.044 --> 01:55:19.112
THAT THERE'S THE STATE REVOLVING

01:55:19.178 --> 01:55:20.113
FUND LOAN THAT.

01:55:20.179 --> 01:55:21.581
THE STATE MATCHES IT COMES FROM

01:55:21.648 --> 01:55:22.982
THE EPA --

01:55:23.049 --> 01:55:24.183
WE HAVE ALL THESE OTHER BONDS

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:25.985
THAT THAT SEEMS TO PUT MONEY

01:55:26.052 --> 01:55:27.720
INTO VARIOUS BUCKETS TO ADDRESS

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:28.788
THIS ISSUE.

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:30.123
ARE BUT I THINK THAT THAT THAT

01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:31.691
IT'S REAL.

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:33.326
OUR THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO

01:55:33.393 --> 01:55:35.461
CREATE A FUN.

01:55:35.528 --> 01:55:36.929
THAT GENERATES THE AMOUNT OF

01:55:36.996 --> 01:55:38.031
REVENUE THAT'S NECESSARY TO

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:39.599
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND I'M

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:40.199
GONNA GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WHY

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:42.335
SAY THAT.

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:43.269
ARM.

01:55:43.336 --> 01:55:44.871
IN IN OUR REGION WE FORM WHAT'S

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:46.539
CALLED THE THE DISADVANTAGED

01:55:46.606 --> 01:55:47.173
COMMUNITIES INFRASTRUCTURE TASK

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.708
FORCE.

01:55:48.775 --> 01:55:50.643
AND TOP WHAT WE'VE DONE IS IS

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:51.844
WE'VE BROUGHT EVERYBODY TOGETHER

01:55:51.911 --> 01:55:53.146
THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS OFFICE THE

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:54.747
CONGRESSMAN'S OFFICE.

01:55:54.814 --> 01:55:56.282
THE SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE VARIOUS

01:55:56.349 --> 01:55:58.151
NONPROFITS LIKE BLUE NEEDLE

01:55:58.217 --> 01:56:00.119
LEADERSHIP COUNCIL --

01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:01.821
BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES --

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:03.656
THE TREND LOCAL TRIBES THE

01:56:03.723 --> 01:56:04.824
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:07.160
AND AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE

01:56:07.226 --> 01:56:08.728
THIS LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:09.696
THE EASTERN CHINA VALLEY AND

01:56:09.762 --> 01:56:11.164
EVERYBODY'S TRYING.

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:13.032
TO WORK IN SILOS TO GET THEIR

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:16.936
PORTION OF NICK WORK TOGETHER TO

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:18.504
TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:56:18.571 --> 01:56:19.672
HERE BECAUSE WE ON THE ACCESS TO

01:56:19.739 --> 01:56:21.107
WATER WITH THE YOU NEED FOR THE

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:22.408
SCHOOL WHETHER YOU NEED BECAUSE

01:56:22.475 --> 01:56:23.543
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD.

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:24.811
ANOTHER ANOTHER AFFORDABLE

01:56:24.877 --> 01:56:26.279
HOUSING COMPLEX OR WHATEVER THE

01:56:26.346 --> 01:56:27.580
CASE IS.

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:29.782
THERE'S A LACK OF PIPE AND SO I

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:31.417
THINK WE WE FORMED THIS TASK

01:56:31.484 --> 01:56:32.118
FORCE.

01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:33.820
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT

01:56:33.886 --> 01:56:35.288
WE DID IN THIS TASK FORCES WHICH

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:37.023
WE DIDN'T A NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.791
AND WE WORK WITH THE COUNTY TO

01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:40.593
HELP US MAP ALL THE STATE SMALL

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.829
WATER SYSTEMS IN EASTERN CHINA

01:56:42.895 --> 01:56:43.463
VALLEY AND THAT'S HOW WE HAVE

01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:45.198
THE NUMBER OF YOU KNOW OVER A

01:56:45.264 --> 01:56:45.732
HUNDRED OF THEM THAT ARE

01:56:45.798 --> 01:56:47.367
SCATTERED.

01:56:47.433 --> 01:56:48.368
AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE.

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:49.035
REGULATED BY THE COUNTY THERE'S

01:56:49.102 --> 01:56:50.336
STILL MORE THAT ARE NOT

01:56:50.403 --> 01:56:51.904
REGULATED BY THE COUNTY.

01:56:51.971 --> 01:56:52.739
THAT THIS PROBABLY DOUBLED IN

01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:53.906
THAT.

01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:56.008
SO WE'RE NOT CAPTURING ALL OF A

01:56:56.075 --> 01:56:58.044
BUT HAVING SAID THAT UP THAT THE

01:56:58.111 --> 01:57:00.413
NUMBER THAT WE DID CAPTURE AND

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.013
AND YOU HAVE TO HAND OUT THERE

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.348
FRONT OF YOU --

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:04.317
WE MAPPED OUT ABOUT MAYBE EIGHTY

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:05.318
TO A HUNDRED DIFFERENT SMALL

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:07.487
WATER SYSTEMS.

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:09.389
AND WE LUMP THEM INTO INTO INTO

01:57:09.455 --> 01:57:10.857
ABOUT FORTY PROJECTS.

01:57:10.923 --> 01:57:13.626
AND THESE FORTY PROJECTS ARE

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:17.864
CONSOLIDATING ANYWHERE FROM. TWO

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.365
TO NINE OUR SMALL WATER SYSTEMS

01:57:19.432 --> 01:57:20.967
WITH ONE PIPELINE AND SO THAT'S

01:57:21.033 --> 01:57:22.201
THAT'S WHAT WE DID WE SAID OKAY

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:23.536
WE'RE GONNA IT WE BUILD THIS

01:57:23.603 --> 01:57:25.037
PIPELINE HOW MANY OF THE SMALL

01:57:25.104 --> 01:57:26.839
WATER SYSTEMS CAN WE CAN WE

01:57:26.906 --> 01:57:28.641
COMBINE CAN WE CONSOLIDATE AND

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:29.609
THAT'S REALLY BEEN OUR EFFORT.

01:57:29.675 --> 01:57:31.110
AT THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER

01:57:31.177 --> 01:57:32.812
DISTRICT IS IS TO CONSOLIDATE.

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:34.914
ALL THE SMALL WATER SYSTEM

01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:35.481
THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN OUR

01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:36.449
APPROACH --

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:38.184
I DON'T THINK WE WE WE REALLY

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:39.786
HAVE.

01:57:39.852 --> 01:57:41.554
A LOT OF ISSUES MAYBE WITH YOUR

01:57:41.621 --> 01:57:43.556
AND IF WE WERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL

01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:46.192
IN THAT SITUATION SYSTEMS THAT

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:47.493
ARE PROBABLY JUST TOO FAR AWAY

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.128
TO THE CENTRALIZED.

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:50.062
WHERE WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME

01:57:50.129 --> 01:57:51.697
SORT OF --

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:53.232
LONGER TO IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW

01:57:53.299 --> 01:57:54.801
THAT UNDER THE SINK TYPE OF

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:57.103
TREATMENT AND THOSE TYPE OF BOB

01:57:57.170 --> 01:57:58.504
MAYBE WHILE HIS TREATMENT SUCH.

01:57:58.571 --> 01:57:59.806
BUT DOT --

01:57:59.872 --> 01:58:01.674
BUT OUT OF I JUST I I WANT TO

01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:04.110
EMPHASIZE IS OUT OF THE OUT OF

01:58:04.177 --> 01:58:05.445
THOSE PROJECTS THAT WE TRADED

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:06.746
THE THIRTY NINE PROJECTS.

01:58:06.813 --> 01:58:08.381
YOU KNOW WE'RE CALCULATING THAT

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:09.248
THAT THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:10.983
ABOUT YOU KNOW SEVENTY FIVE

01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:13.119
MILLION DOLLARS. TO EXECUTE THE

01:58:13.186 --> 01:58:14.620
THIRTY NINE PROJECTS.

01:58:14.687 --> 01:58:17.089
AND AND THINKING ABOUT

01:58:17.156 --> 01:58:17.390
[inaudible]

01:58:17.457 --> 01:58:19.959
OUR HOW AGGRESSIVE WE'VE BEEN

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:21.394
PURSUING GRANT FUNDING. FOR THE

01:58:21.461 --> 01:58:23.563
PAST DECADE.

01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:25.832
AND THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:27.099
IN IN IN SECURING THAT

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:29.202
GRANDFATHER.

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:30.470
I WOULD SAY THAT AT THE PACE

01:58:30.536 --> 01:58:31.437
THEY WERE GOING.

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:33.339
IT TAKE US YOU KNOW ANOTHER FEW

01:58:33.406 --> 01:58:34.941
DECADES BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:36.409
EXECUTE ON ALL THOSE PROJECTS SO

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:38.110
THAT JUST SHOWS ME.

01:58:38.177 --> 01:58:39.645
THAT THERE IS A LACK OF FUNDING.

01:58:39.712 --> 01:58:42.515
ATTRIBUTED. TO ADDRESSING THIS

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:43.950
ISSUE -- AND

01:58:44.016 --> 01:58:44.984
AND I WOULD JUST AND I WOULD

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:46.118
CALL THAT THE FIRST SPACE

01:58:46.185 --> 01:58:47.186
BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL PROBABLY

01:58:47.253 --> 01:58:50.523
SECOND PHASE BUT IT TAKE US

01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:51.157
FIFTY YEARS PROBABLY JUST AS THE

01:58:51.224 --> 01:58:52.058
FIRST SPACE.

01:58:52.124 --> 01:58:52.792
AND I THINK ARE.

01:58:52.859 --> 01:58:53.993
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE DO

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:54.994
FIND SOME SORT OF REVENUE

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:57.129
STRUCTURE THAT THEY CREATES MORE

01:58:57.196 --> 01:58:59.265
FUNDING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES --

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:00.733
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S QUITE

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:01.601
ENOUGH.

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:03.202
OFFER THE NEED THAT THAT THAT WE

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:04.470
HAVE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:59:04.537 --> 01:59:05.371
ARM AND SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE

01:59:05.438 --> 01:59:08.975
MY CAR I WANTED.

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:12.044
TO PAINT THAT PICTURE --

01:59:12.111 --> 01:59:13.446
I THINK THAT.

01:59:13.513 --> 01:59:14.580
IN IN OUR REGION I DON'T KNOW IF

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:15.581
THIS IS THE CASE IN OTHER

01:59:15.648 --> 01:59:17.083
REGIONS ARE ISSUES WITH THE

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:18.684
STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS.

01:59:18.751 --> 01:59:21.153
ARE IN OUR REGION I WOULD SAY

01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:21.354
THAT.

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:22.688
ARE.

01:59:22.755 --> 01:59:25.057
IF THE MCL FOR THE CHROMIUM SIX

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:26.158
IN INCOME BACK.

01:59:26.225 --> 01:59:27.260
OUR PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:28.961
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES.

01:59:29.028 --> 01:59:30.563
BUT WE STILL HAVE THE ISSUE WITH

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:32.598
THE STATE'S SMALL WATER SYSTEMS.

01:59:32.665 --> 01:59:33.799
AGAIN OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:35.134
SCATTERED ACROSS THE VALLEY

01:59:35.201 --> 01:59:36.536
FLOOR --

01:59:36.602 --> 01:59:38.404
RURAL AREAS --

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:41.040
FOLKS THAT LIVE WITHIN THE THE

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:42.508
FARM FIELDS --

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:43.342
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY WORK

01:59:43.409 --> 01:59:44.944
IN A LOT OF TIMES THESE ARE THE

01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:45.878
FOLKS.

01:59:45.945 --> 01:59:47.413
WHEN YOU LOOK WHEN YOU THINK

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.080
ABOUT THE COACHELLA VALLEY AND I

01:59:48.147 --> 01:59:48.981
SAID YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ONE SIDE

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:50.583
OF THE VALLEY THAT'S RURAL AND

01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:51.918
AGRICULTURE AND IN THE OTHER

01:59:51.984 --> 01:59:52.885
SIDE OF THE VALLEY IS GOLF

01:59:52.952 --> 01:59:54.220
COURSES IN?

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:57.156
AND LANDSCAPE AND AND AND THE

01:59:57.223 --> 01:59:58.925
RESORT LIFE WHAT'S A LOT YOU

01:59:58.991 --> 02:00:01.160
KNOW IT'S IT'S THOSE FOLKS.

02:00:01.227 --> 02:00:02.862
THEY GOAL WORK THERE.

02:00:02.929 --> 02:00:03.462
AND THEN THEY GO BACK TO WHERE

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:04.697
THEY LIVE.

02:00:04.764 --> 02:00:05.798
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THESE TYPE

02:00:05.865 --> 02:00:07.433
OF AMENITIES RIGHT IN SO IT'S

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:08.634
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM IT'S

02:00:08.701 --> 02:00:09.201
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:00:09.268 --> 02:00:10.770
WORKING ON AND I WANT TO THANK

02:00:10.836 --> 02:00:12.605

OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR STORY.

02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:17.009
AND AND I THINK THAT --

02:00:17.076 --> 02:00:18.878
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A

02:00:18.945 --> 02:00:21.147
STATEWIDE ISSUE INTO IN THE

02:00:21.213 --> 02:00:22.648
SOLUTION NEEDS.

02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:23.683

DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA URBAN

02:00:40.967 --> 02:00:42.201
WATER AGENCIES.

02:00:42.268 --> 02:00:44.303
MY BACKGROUND IS I HAVE A PHD IN

02:00:44.370 --> 02:00:46.839
ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING HAVE

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:47.440
BEEN PRACTICING IN THE WATER

02:00:47.506 --> 02:00:49.909
TECHNOLOGY IN POLICY AREAS FOR

02:00:49.976 --> 02:00:51.043
OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS --

02:00:51.110 --> 02:00:55.181
A IS A NON ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:57.750
COMPRISED OF ELEVEN OF THE URBAN

02:00:57.817 --> 02:00:59.986
CALIFORNIA AGENCIES RANGING FROM

02:01:00.052 --> 02:01:02.421
THE SAN DIEGO LA.

02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:05.458
BAY AREA AND FRESNO AREAS.

02:01:05.524 --> 02:01:07.426
THE PURPOSE OF THAT ORGANIZATION

02:01:07.493 --> 02:01:09.762
IS TO INFORM AND HELP SHAPE

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:10.997
WATER POLICY.

02:01:11.063 --> 02:01:11.864
WE'VE BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER

02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:15.134
THIRTY YEARS --

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:16.469
HAS BEEN WORKING THE

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:18.004
ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABLE

02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:19.538
ISSUES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

02:01:19.605 --> 02:01:21.540
YEARS AND VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO

02:01:21.607 --> 02:01:22.842
BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.

02:01:22.908 --> 02:01:24.210
REALLY WANT TO HELP BRING SOME

02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:26.245
LEADERSHIP TO THE TABLE TO MAKE

02:01:26.312 --> 02:01:27.413
AN IMPACT WE THINK THAT'S

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:29.649
IMPORTANT FOR THE URBAN AGENCIES

02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:31.350
TO BE ENGAGED.

02:01:31.417 --> 02:01:33.252
IN THE SOLUTION.

02:01:33.319 --> 02:01:34.854
I'VE UP PROVIDED COPIES OF A

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:37.056
BRIEF IN ISSUE BRIEF THERE ARE

02:01:37.123 --> 02:01:38.791
MORE DETAILS AVAILABLE ON THE

02:01:38.858 --> 02:01:42.028
COOL WEBSITE AT C0 DOT ORG

02:01:42.094 --> 02:01:42.662
IT'LL HIT SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS

02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:44.096
THEIR AS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

02:01:44.163 --> 02:01:46.432
MENTIONED.

02:01:46.499 --> 02:01:47.566
THIS IS VERY MUCH A MULTIFACETED

02:01:47.633 --> 02:01:49.835
ISSUE -- IS

02:01:49.902 --> 02:01:52.104
FOCUS AND OUR STRENGTH REALLY IS

02:01:52.171 --> 02:01:53.873
TO DIG IN TO THE TECHNICAL

02:01:53.939 --> 02:01:55.574
CHALLENGES AND POSSIBLE

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:57.276
SOLUTIONS.

02:01:57.343 --> 02:01:58.911
SO WE HAVE LEVERAGE THE STATE'S

02:01:58.978 --> 02:02:00.913
HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER DATABASE

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:03.916
AND OTHER STATE DATABASES TO

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:06.018
LOOK AT SYSTEMS SMALL COMMUNITY

02:02:06.085 --> 02:02:07.720
SYSTEMS WITH WATER QUALITY

02:02:07.787 --> 02:02:09.321
VIOLATIONS OVER THE LAST FIVE

02:02:09.388 --> 02:02:11.023
YEARS.

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:11.590
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO BETTER

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:13.259
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM SO THAT

02:02:13.325 --> 02:02:15.294
WE CAN INFORM SOLUTIONS THAT

02:02:15.361 --> 02:02:17.263
WILL BE LASTING AND MOST COST

02:02:17.329 --> 02:02:18.531
EFFECTIVE.

02:02:18.597 --> 02:02:20.966
AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ARSENIC IS A

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:24.136
CONTINUED PROBLEM TCP IS A NEW

02:02:24.203 --> 02:02:25.971
ONE ON THE HORIZON CHROME SIX IS

02:02:26.038 --> 02:02:28.307
PENDING --

02:02:28.374 --> 02:02:29.575
ALONG WITH NITRATE AND SOME THE

02:02:29.642 --> 02:02:31.444
OTHER CONSTITUENTS WHICH ARE

02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:33.779
LESS PREVALENT IN THE SMALL

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:34.980
COMMUNITY SYSTEMS THAN SAY IN

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:36.348
THE DOMESTIC WELLS AREA SO IT

02:02:36.415 --> 02:02:37.950
REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF A

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:39.485
SYSTEM YOU'RE LOOKING AT TURNS

02:02:39.552 --> 02:02:40.753
OF THE CONSTITUENTS.

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:42.455
SO AGAIN WE'RE FOCUSED ON THOSE

02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:44.557
COMMUNITIES SYSTEMS.

02:02:44.623 --> 02:02:46.125
BY LOOKING AT THAT SUBSET OR

02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:47.827
INTENT IS TO TRY TO ADVANCE SOME

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:49.695
EARLY PROGRESS AND ON THE GROUND

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:50.863
IMPROVEMENTS.

02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:52.565
WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO ACT AS A

02:02:52.631 --> 02:02:54.166
CONVENER OF PARTNERS AND A

02:02:54.233 --> 02:02:56.068
CATALYST TO GET SOMETHING

02:02:56.135 --> 02:02:57.603
STARTED.

02:02:57.670 --> 02:03:01.140
ULTIMATELY OUR AIM IS TO GET OUT

02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:03.609
THE TECHNICAL ROOT CAUSES.

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:04.844
OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THE

02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:06.579
PERSISTENTLY FAILING SYSTEMS

02:03:06.645 --> 02:03:08.514
BOTH THOSE THAT ARE EXISTING AND

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:09.782
THOSE THAT WILL.

02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:12.518
CONTINUE TO FACE NEW CHALLENGES

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:13.686
TAKE ACTIONS THAT WILL HELP TO

02:03:13.753 --> 02:03:15.688
BREAK THAT CYCLE.

02:03:15.755 --> 02:03:18.557
SO WE'VE LAID OUT THREE STEPS.

02:03:18.624 --> 02:03:19.859
TO HELP RESOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR

02:03:19.925 --> 02:03:22.962
THE FUTURE LONG TERM.

02:03:23.028 --> 02:03:24.864
THE FIRST IS TO IDENTIFY WHICH

02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:27.500
SYSTEMS WHERE TO BEGIN.

02:03:27.566 --> 02:03:28.734
AND I MENTIONED THAT WE LOOKED

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:29.435
AT THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER

02:03:29.502 --> 02:03:31.203
DATABASE OUR ANALYSIS ACTUALLY

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:33.939
INDICATES OVER THAT FIVE YEARS.

02:03:34.006 --> 02:03:35.641
THERE ARE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:37.910
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE ONE OR MORE

02:03:37.977 --> 02:03:39.845
WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS DURING

02:03:39.912 --> 02:03:41.781
THAT TIME FRAME SERVING A TOTAL

02:03:41.847 --> 02:03:43.716
OF NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:03:43.783 --> 02:03:43.949
PEOPLE.

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:47.286
AGAIN THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE FROM

02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:47.887
SIX THE LOWER LEVELS UNTIL WE

02:03:47.953 --> 02:03:49.588
GET TO THAT.

02:03:49.655 --> 02:03:52.892
ABOUT 14% OF THOSE SYSTEMS OR A

02:03:52.958 --> 02:03:54.994
HUNDRED AND FIFTY ARE OUT OF

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.562
COMPLIANCE ON A WHAT WE TURNED

02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:58.230
PERSISTENT BASIS.

02:03:58.297 --> 02:03:59.832
THE WAY WE LOOKED AT THAT WAS

02:03:59.899 --> 02:04:01.066
TWELVE VIOLATIONS OVER A FIVE

02:04:01.133 --> 02:04:02.635
YEAR PERIOD COULD DRAW THAT

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:04.003
THRESHOLD IN ANY PARTICULAR

02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:05.337
LOCATION.

02:04:05.404 --> 02:04:06.238
BUT WE FELT IT WAS HELPFUL TO

02:04:06.305 --> 02:04:08.274
REALLY LOOK AT THE PERSISTENCE

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:13.279
TO HELP PRIORITIZE THE FOCUS.

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:15.147
OF THOSE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:04:15.214 --> 02:04:17.216
SMALL COMMUNITY SYSTEMS NEARLY

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:19.618
80% OF THAT SEVERELY IMPACTED

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:22.154
POPULATION IS FOUND WITHIN ONLY

02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:23.189
THIRTY THREE SYSTEMS.

02:04:23.255 --> 02:04:24.456
THOSE OF THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE

02:04:24.523 --> 02:04:25.524
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED

02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:27.827
CONNECTIONS.

02:04:27.893 --> 02:04:29.328
OUR THOUGHT IS THAT THAT.

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:31.363
IS A TANGIBLE PLACE TO START TO

02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:32.531
DO A LITTLE MORE OF THIS

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:34.600
TECHNICAL WORK TO TRY TO CREATE

02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:37.069
SOME EARLY ACTIONS EARLY WINS

02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:38.504
SHOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

02:04:38.571 --> 02:04:40.339
LEARN AS WE GO.

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:42.041
TEST AND REFINE SOME WORKABLE

02:04:42.107 --> 02:04:43.876
MODELS AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING

02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:45.911
THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IN

02:04:45.978 --> 02:04:47.413
PARALLEL TO THE OTHER EFFORTS.

02:04:47.479 --> 02:04:49.048
WE'VE DEVELOPED A STRATEGY TO

02:04:49.114 --> 02:04:50.683
ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE FOR

02:04:50.749 --> 02:04:51.984
SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS FOR THE

02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:53.085
FUTURE.

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:54.119
THAT IS THREE PRONGED TREATMENT

02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:55.454
TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONAL

02:04:55.521 --> 02:04:57.156
STRATEGIES AN INSTITUTIONAL

02:04:57.223 --> 02:04:58.390
MODELS.

02:04:58.457 --> 02:05:00.092
WITH REGARD TO THE INSTITUTIONAL

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:02.161
MODELS IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

02:05:02.228 --> 02:05:03.696
TO LOOK AT SUSTAINABLY SIZED

02:05:03.762 --> 02:05:05.197
SYSTEMS THIS IS A NATIONAL

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:07.333
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE HUNDRED

02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:09.101
AND FIFTY THOUSAND COMMUNITY

02:05:09.168 --> 02:05:09.702
WATER SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:12.838
THIS TO BE SUSTAINABLE. FOR THE

02:05:12.905 --> 02:05:14.607
LONG TERM AND PARTICULARLY WITH

02:05:14.673 --> 02:05:15.741
NEW CHALLENGES OF EMERGING

02:05:15.808 --> 02:05:18.644
CONTAMINANTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:05:18.711 --> 02:05:19.678
WE THINK THERE ARE HUGE

02:05:19.745 --> 02:05:22.081
ADVANTAGES WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES

02:05:22.147 --> 02:05:23.315
AND IN FACT THERE ARE

02:05:23.382 --> 02:05:25.017
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DO THIS

02:05:25.084 --> 02:05:26.051
IN A MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE

02:05:26.118 --> 02:05:27.620
WAY IN A WAY THAT IS FUTURE

02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:28.554
LOOKING.

02:05:28.621 --> 02:05:29.188
THAT WILL ADDRESS THE

02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:31.624
COMBINATIONS OF CONSTITUENTS AND

02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:33.626
NOT JUST THE TRADITIONAL ONES

02:05:33.692 --> 02:05:35.094
THAT WE SEE IN PLACE NOW.

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:37.029
THE ABILITY TO MONITOR WATER

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:38.464
QUALITY REAL TIME.

02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:40.132
REMOTELY OPERATE THE SYSTEMS

02:05:40.199 --> 02:05:41.901
INTRODUCES WHOLE NEW OPERATIONAL

02:05:41.967 --> 02:05:43.736
MODELS THAT I THINK CAN HELP TO

02:05:43.802 --> 02:05:45.838
REALLY STREAMLINED OR SPREAD THE

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:48.040
OWNER MONEY TO TO PROVIDE THE

02:05:48.107 --> 02:05:49.208
GREATEST BENEFIT.

02:05:49.275 --> 02:05:50.910
MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND MOST

02:05:50.976 --> 02:05:53.379
RELIABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLIES.

02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:55.547
FINALLY ENGAGED PARTNERSHIPS

02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:57.016
THERE IS SO MUCH INTEREST FROM

02:05:57.082 --> 02:05:58.918
MANY CORNERS.

02:05:58.984 --> 02:06:01.520
SO MANY ARE MOTIVATED TO HELP

02:06:01.587 --> 02:06:03.489
FIX THIS PROBLEM AND WE'VE BEEN

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:04.990
STARTING TO INITIATE SOME

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:06.892
CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE FOLKS

02:06:06.959 --> 02:06:08.427
SO THE TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS.

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:09.695
WHO ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT WILL

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:11.096
WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT TRAINS

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:13.198
THAT WE COULD PROVIDE WITHIN

02:06:13.265 --> 02:06:14.700
PACKAGE SYSTEMS?

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:16.235
THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO BEAR

02:06:16.302 --> 02:06:18.537
VERY QUICKLY. TO CREATE SOME OF

02:06:18.604 --> 02:06:20.172
THESE VERY NEAR TERM WINS AND

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:22.174
THAT CAN BE READY TO DEAL WITH

02:06:22.241 --> 02:06:24.877
THE NEXT THINGS THAT COME ALONG

02:06:24.944 --> 02:06:26.612
INCLUDING CLOCK FROM.

02:06:26.679 --> 02:06:27.813
SIX UTILITIES YOU KNOW THEY'RE

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:30.149
SET UP TO RUN REGIONAL SYSTEMS

02:06:30.215 --> 02:06:31.550
AND I THINK AGAIN.

02:06:31.617 --> 02:06:33.619
GETTING TO SUSTAINABLY SIZE

02:06:33.686 --> 02:06:36.121
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE THE THE

02:06:36.188 --> 02:06:37.856
TECHNICAL WHERE WITH ALL TO BE

02:06:37.923 --> 02:06:41.060
ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE.

02:06:41.126 --> 02:06:42.695
IN A SAFE AND RELIABLE MANNER.

02:06:42.761 --> 02:06:44.897
SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:45.431
THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN

02:06:45.497 --> 02:06:46.332
HELPING [inaudible]

02:06:46.398 --> 02:06:48.500
UNIVERSITIES.

02:06:48.567 --> 02:06:50.469
ARE VERY PRODUCTIVE HERE A WE'VE

02:06:50.536 --> 02:06:52.404
BEEN PARTNERING IN PARTICULAR

02:06:52.471 --> 02:06:53.572
WITH MISTER THOMAS GUERRA A

02:06:53.639 --> 02:06:55.007
FRESNO STATE WHOSE --

02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:56.542
SITTING IN THE ROOM --

02:06:56.608 --> 02:06:58.577
AND HAS SOME GREAT IDEAS ABOUT

02:06:58.644 --> 02:07:00.179
THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE.

02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:01.847
AND FINALLY FOUNDATIONS HAVE

02:07:01.914 --> 02:07:04.650
TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN HELPING

02:07:04.717 --> 02:07:06.051
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

02:07:06.118 --> 02:07:07.519
RECOGNIZING THAT.

02:07:07.586 --> 02:07:08.854
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HERE IN

02:07:08.921 --> 02:07:10.189
CALIFORNIA AND THEN THERE'S A

02:07:10.255 --> 02:07:11.757
BROADER NEEDS NATIONALLY AND WE

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:13.859
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD AS A

02:07:13.926 --> 02:07:14.626
STATE.

02:07:14.693 --> 02:07:16.128
IN SERVING IN A DEVELOPING A

02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:17.329
MODEL THAT CAN BE REPLICATED

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:20.466
ELSEWHERE.

02:07:20.532 --> 02:07:22.001
THE THIRD STEP IN THE PROCESS

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:23.836
REALLY IS TO PREVENT NEW

02:07:23.902 --> 02:07:25.904
UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS FROM

02:07:25.971 --> 02:07:26.805
FORMING.

02:07:26.872 --> 02:07:28.507
STOP THE BLEEDING LEGISLATION

02:07:28.574 --> 02:07:30.142
DEFINITELY HELPS TO ADDRESS THAT

02:07:30.209 --> 02:07:30.976
THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL

02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:33.278
DETAILS THAT WE WILL --

02:07:33.345 --> 02:07:34.313
YOU KNOW THE DOUBLES KIND OF IN

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:35.447
THE DETAILS IN TERMS OF THE

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:37.616
ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT ON

02:07:37.683 --> 02:07:38.851
THE GROUNDS TO BE SURE THAT

02:07:38.917 --> 02:07:40.753
THOSE SYSTEMS WE DON'T.

02:07:40.819 --> 02:07:41.620
HAVE NEW SYSTEMS ENTERING THAT

02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:45.157
ARE WILL.

02:07:45.224 --> 02:07:46.492
SO COOPER I MENTION CONTINUES

02:07:46.558 --> 02:07:48.394
OUR WORK --

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.628
WE ARE --

02:07:49.695 --> 02:07:51.497
WORKING A FAST TRACK PROJECT

02:07:51.563 --> 02:07:52.731
RIGHT NOW WITH THE WATER

02:07:52.798 --> 02:07:54.133
RESEARCH FOUNDATION THIS IS A

02:07:54.199 --> 02:07:55.968
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION.

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:57.569
VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC IN

02:07:57.636 --> 02:07:59.304
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PACIFIC

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:01.974
INSTITUTE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO

02:08:02.041 --> 02:08:03.976
START TO DEVELOP SOME ANSWERS BY --

02:08:04.043 --> 02:08:06.412
MID YEAR.

02:08:06.478 --> 02:08:08.113
THAT WORK INCLUDES SEVERAL

02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:09.681
ASPECTS ONE OF WHICH IS

02:08:09.748 --> 02:08:11.383
CONVENING A WORKSHOP OF

02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:13.919
POTENTIAL PARTNERS TO BRAINSTORM

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:14.987
SOME OF THESE TECHNICAL

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:16.488
APPROACHES AND SOLUTIONS.

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:17.823
REALLY WHAT COULD BE WHAT COULD

02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:20.059
WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR

02:08:20.125 --> 02:08:21.560
REALLY PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER TO

02:08:21.627 --> 02:08:25.731
CREATE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS.

02:08:25.798 --> 02:08:28.167
SITE VISITS TO GET OUT TO SOME

02:08:28.233 --> 02:08:28.767
OF THE AREAS THAT ARE

02:08:28.834 --> 02:08:30.402
PARTICULARLY HAVING SOME

02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:32.304
CHALLENGES AND AND THERE'S GREAT

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:33.305
INTEREST IN BRINGING SOME OF

02:08:33.372 --> 02:08:34.807
THESE SKID MOUNTED SYSTEMS TO

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:35.874
ACTUALLY TEST.

02:08:35.941 --> 02:08:37.943
THE ABILITY OF THEM TO TREAT THE

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:40.946
SOURCES OF WATER.

02:08:41.013 --> 02:08:42.548
AND REALLY TO LOOK UP DIG IN A

02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:44.917
LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMSOF THE

02:08:44.983 --> 02:08:46.718
THE THIRTY THREE THAT ARE LARGER.

02:08:46.785 --> 02:08:47.986
THAN TWO HUNDRED CONNECTIONS BUT

02:08:48.053 --> 02:08:49.721
ALSO LOOKING AT SOME OF THE CASE

02:08:49.788 --> 02:08:51.824
STUDIES OF THE SMALLER SYSTEMS

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:53.525
TO TRY TO DEVELOP MODELS.

02:08:53.592 --> 02:08:54.793
THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED AND

02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:56.662
EXTENDED TO OTHER AREAS THAT

02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:59.064
REALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:00.532
IT WOULD ALSO BE SUPER HELPFUL

02:09:00.599 --> 02:09:01.500
TO HAVE AN ASSESSMENT OF

02:09:01.567 --> 02:09:02.868
EXISTING FUNDS AND PERHAPS SOME

02:09:02.935 --> 02:09:05.304
MEANS. TO GET A MORE CREATIVE TO

02:09:05.370 --> 02:09:07.005
PEEL OUT SOME OF THAT FUNDING.

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:09.274
TO ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD SOME OF

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:10.809
THE THINGS THAT WERE IDENTIFYING

02:09:10.876 --> 02:09:11.844
THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THAT

02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:13.345
FUNDING IS SUFFICIENT TO WANT TO

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:14.346
BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT WE

02:09:14.413 --> 02:09:16.281
ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED. FOR LONGER

02:09:16.348 --> 02:09:18.817
TERM FUNDING SOURCES BUT WE

02:09:18.884 --> 02:09:20.219
KRISTIN FOR INFORMED THAT

02:09:20.285 --> 02:09:21.854
CONVERSATION OVER THE VERY NEAR

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.689
TERM AND WE THINK IT'S TIME TO

02:09:23.755 --> 02:09:25.924
ACT.

02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:27.993
WE ALSO SEE CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:29.328
WITH STATE PARTNERS AND WITH

02:09:29.394 --> 02:09:31.130
NGOS WHO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

02:09:31.196 --> 02:09:33.532
WITH CLOSELY OVER THE YEARS AND

02:09:33.599 --> 02:09:36.969
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING.

02:09:37.035 --> 02:09:38.871
SO JUST IN CLOSING.

02:09:38.937 --> 02:09:39.705
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WE THINK

02:09:39.771 --> 02:09:42.074
IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO

02:09:42.141 --> 02:09:42.574
START.

02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:44.309
OWNED BY REALLY UNDERSTANDING

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:47.880
THE PROBLEMS. FOR THE LONG TERM.

02:09:47.946 --> 02:09:49.882
SO THAT WE CAN CREATE SYSTEMS

02:09:49.948 --> 02:09:50.916
FOR THE FUTURE.

02:09:50.983 --> 02:09:52.451
THAT ARE ADAPTABLE TO THE

02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:53.619
EMERGING WATER QUALITY

02:09:53.685 --> 02:09:55.821
CHALLENGES THAT CAN BE OPERATED

02:09:55.888 --> 02:09:57.756
MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLY AND COST

02:09:57.823 --> 02:10:00.325
EFFECTIVELY AND RELIABLY. FOR A

02:10:00.392 --> 02:10:02.161
LASTING SOLUTION THIS IS NOT

02:10:02.227 --> 02:10:03.795
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO BE

02:10:03.862 --> 02:10:05.264
COMING BACK AND TALKING ABOUT IN

02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:06.532
ANOTHER TEN YEARS FROM NOW

02:10:06.598 --> 02:10:08.467
REALLY WANT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM

02:10:08.534 --> 02:10:10.035
FOR THE LONG TERM.

02:10:10.102 --> 02:10:11.370
WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA HAS AN

02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:13.238
OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD HERE IN

02:10:13.305 --> 02:10:16.508
FORGING NEW SOLUTIONS. FOR SAFE

02:10:16.575 --> 02:10:18.710
RELIABLE WATER FOR THE FUTURE.

02:10:18.777 --> 02:10:20.412
WE HAVE THE NATIONAL ATTENTION

02:10:20.479 --> 02:10:21.947
VERY MUCH ON THIS ISSUE

02:10:22.014 --> 02:10:23.682
CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

02:10:23.749 --> 02:10:25.317
TO SET THE MODEL FOR THE REST OF

02:10:25.384 --> 02:10:28.086
THE COUNTRY. TWO WOULD WEAR MUCH

02:10:28.153 --> 02:10:30.389
LIKE TO JOIN FORCES WITH YOU ALL

02:10:30.455 --> 02:10:30.989
AND PARTNERS TO HELP MAKE THAT

02:10:31.056 --> 02:10:31.857
HAPPEN [inaudible]

TECHNICAL INSIGHT.

02:10:39.565 --> 02:10:41.066
AND YOUR SUGGESTION --

02:10:41.133 --> 02:10:43.135
THAT WE COULD GET 280% OF THE

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:45.270
PROP UP THE PEOPLE SUFFERING

02:10:45.337 --> 02:10:47.072
THESE PROBLEMS BY LOOKING AT A

02:10:47.139 --> 02:10:48.807
RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

02:10:48.874 --> 02:10:50.609
DISTRICTS SO I I THINK THAT'S

02:10:50.676 --> 02:10:53.045
IMPORTANT INSIGHT --

02:10:53.111 --> 02:10:54.513

FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

02:12:09.354 --> 02:12:10.989
BUT TO DO THIS I BELIEVE REALLY

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:12.724
NEED TO ANALYZE AND UNDERSTAND

02:12:12.791 --> 02:12:14.526
THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS DIFFICULT

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:15.260
PROBLEM.

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:16.928
AND THEN TAKE A DUAL APPROACH

02:12:16.995 --> 02:12:19.131
THAT FOCUSES BOTH ON REFORMING

02:12:19.197 --> 02:12:21.099
THE GOVERNANCE AND FLOOD SERVICE

02:12:21.166 --> 02:12:23.669
DELIVERY MODEL OF SMALL FAILING

02:12:39.751 --> 02:12:40.852
DISPOSITIONAL IS ALL TALK ABOUT

02:12:40.919 --> 02:12:42.487
FURTHER WE'RE PROPOSING A

02:12:42.554 --> 02:12:43.822
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH WAS

VITALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THE

02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:10.615
ROOT CAUSE SO I'D LIKE TO START

02:13:10.682 --> 02:13:12.317
OUT WITH AN EXPERIENCE WE'VE HAD

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:14.052
WITH A FEELING WATER SYSTEM.

02:13:14.119 --> 02:13:15.487
AND DISCUSS THE COMMON ROOT

CONTAMINATED WATER.

02:13:42.414 --> 02:13:44.149
INFRASTRUCTURE SO DEGRADED THAT

02:13:44.216 --> 02:13:45.984
THERE WAS NO FIRE PROTECTION FOR

02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:47.552
THE COMMUNITY AND THE WATER IS

02:13:47.619 --> 02:13:49.421
ONLY AVAILABLE DURING CERTAIN

TIMES OF DAY OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

02:13:50.956 --> 02:13:52.958
THE SYSTEM OWNERS IN CUSTOMERS

02:13:53.024 --> 02:13:54.926
LACK THE FINANCIAL RATE BASE AND

TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO ADDRESS

02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:58.930
THE ISSUE AND THE COMPANY WENT

02:13:58.997 --> 02:14:00.565
INTO FINANCIAL RECEIVERSHIP.

02:14:29.895 --> 02:14:30.829
THE STATE.

02:14:30.896 --> 02:14:31.763
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT LITTLE MORE

02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:34.766
DETAIL COUPLE THOSE ISSUE AREAS

AND SIXTY FOUR SYSTEMS

02:14:37.636 --> 02:14:39.438
IDENTIFIED AS NON COMPLIANT IN

02:14:39.504 --> 02:14:41.873
THE STATE'S DATABASE. 81% OF

02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:44.075
THOSE SYSTEMS SERVE LESS THAN

02:14:44.142 --> 02:14:45.477
FOUR HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS

02:14:45.544 --> 02:14:46.745
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:14:46.812 --> 02:14:48.680
DATA BASE AND STANISLAUS COUNTY

02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:49.948
FIFTEEN OF THE SEVENTEEN SYSTEMS

02:14:50.015 --> 02:14:52.050
OUT OF COMPLIANCE SERVE LESS

02:14:52.117 --> 02:14:52.851
THAN TWO HUNDRED SERVICE

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:53.618

02:14:53.685 --> 02:14:56.421
IN MONTEREY COUNTY ALL TWENTY

02:14:56.488 --> 02:14:57.889
TWO OF THE NON COMPLIANT SYSTEMS

02:14:57.956 --> 02:14:59.157
HAVE LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND SIR

02:14:59.224 --> 02:15:01.426
SERVICE CONNECTIONS WITH SO MUCH

02:15:01.493 --> 02:15:03.962
WITH SUCH SMALL RATE BASES.

02:15:04.029 --> 02:15:05.697
MANY OF THE SYSTEM STRUGGLE TO

02:15:05.764 --> 02:15:08.033
SUPPORT NORMAL OPERATIONS TO

02:15:08.099 --> 02:15:09.901

MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING LEGAL

02:15:13.605 --> 02:15:14.873
FINANCIAL REPORTING WATER

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:17.108
QUALITY TESTING INSURANCE.

02:15:17.175 --> 02:15:18.844
OFFICE SPACE ALL THE SIMILAR

02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:21.046
EXPENSES THAT ARE COMMON TO ALL

02:15:21.112 --> 02:15:22.714
OUR UTILITIES REGARDLESS OF THE

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:24.850
SIZE IN ONE WATER QUALITY ISSUES

02:15:24.916 --> 02:15:26.818
OCCUR A WELL FAILS

02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:28.320
INFRASTRUCTURE FAILS.

02:15:28.386 --> 02:15:29.521
TRYING TO SPREAD THOSE

02:15:29.588 --> 02:15:32.157
EXTRAORDINARY COSTS OVER FOUR

02:15:32.224 --> 02:15:33.525
HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS ARE

02:15:33.592 --> 02:15:35.093
LESS JUST BECOMES UNTENABLE.

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:37.095
BUT THIS WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE

02:15:37.162 --> 02:15:39.397
WITH THE LINEAR CAM.

02:15:39.464 --> 02:15:41.766
WE'RE SPREADING THE EIGHTY NINE

02:15:41.833 --> 02:15:42.501
HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH

02:15:42.567 --> 02:15:44.035

TRACK COMMUNITY SAID.

02:15:52.944 --> 02:15:53.845
SERVICE DISTRICT WERE

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:55.714
APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND

02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:56.781
DOLLARS PER YEAR AND REPLACEMENT

02:15:56.848 --> 02:15:58.517
WATER COSTS PURCHASE FROM THE

02:15:58.583 --> 02:16:00.151
CITY A SERIES ARE BEING SPREAD

02:16:00.218 --> 02:16:01.353
OVER FIFTY ONE SERVICE

02:16:01.419 --> 02:16:03.221
CONNECTIONS WITH HUGE IMPACTS ON

02:16:03.288 --> 02:16:04.022
RATES.

02:16:04.089 --> 02:16:05.924
IN SHORT FOR THESE VERY SMALL

02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:08.460
SYSTEMS IN MANY OTHER FEELING

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:09.361
WATER SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE

02:16:09.427 --> 02:16:11.463
STATE THE UTILITY BUSINESS

02:16:11.530 --> 02:16:13.899
ECONOMICS JUST REALLY DON'T WORK.

02:16:13.965 --> 02:16:15.267
SECOND IN EVALUATING THE

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:17.302
FINANCIAL RECORDS FROM FORTY

02:16:17.369 --> 02:16:19.070
SYSTEMS RANGING IN SIZE FROM

02:16:19.137 --> 02:16:22.307
LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE TO OVER A

02:16:22.374 --> 02:16:22.908
HUNDRED THOUSAND WE ALSO FOUND

02:16:22.974 --> 02:16:24.276
THAT MANY OF THE SMALLER SYSTEMS

02:16:24.342 --> 02:16:25.610
HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF

02:16:25.677 --> 02:16:26.444
THEIR RATES.

02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:27.345
THEY'RE BEING PAID BY THEIR

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:28.547
CUSTOMERS GOING TO

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:29.948
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD THOSE

02:16:30.015 --> 02:16:31.316
CATEGORIES THAT I PREVIOUSLY

02:16:31.383 --> 02:16:33.418
DISCUSSED. FOR THE LARGE SYSTEMS

02:16:33.485 --> 02:16:35.253
WE SHOULD WE USUALLY SEE COST

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:37.088
ABOUT 30% OR LESS OF OUR

02:16:37.155 --> 02:16:38.223
OPERATING BUDGET GOING TO

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:39.858
OVERHEAD FOR THOSE SMALLER

02:16:39.925 --> 02:16:41.893
SYSTEMS WE OBSERVE OVERHEAD

02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:44.129
COSTS IN SOME CASES HIGH 60% OF

02:16:44.195 --> 02:16:44.930
BUDGET.

02:16:44.996 --> 02:16:46.097
ARE THAT SIXTY CENTS OUT OF

02:16:46.164 --> 02:16:47.899
EVERY CUSTOMER DOLLAR GOING TO

02:16:47.966 --> 02:16:50.268
BASIC OVERHEAD RATHER THAN CORE

02:16:50.335 --> 02:16:51.736
OPERATIONS AND WATER QUALITY

02:16:51.803 --> 02:16:52.671
NEEDS.

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:53.772
THAT THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THE

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:55.307
REASONS SOME OF THESE VERY SMALL

02:16:55.373 --> 02:16:56.875
SYSTEMS CAN EXPERIENCE HIGH

02:16:56.942 --> 02:16:57.709
RATES.

02:16:57.776 --> 02:16:58.710
NOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

02:16:58.777 --> 02:17:00.078
THERE ARE SMALL MANY SMALL

02:17:00.145 --> 02:17:01.947
SYSTEMS THAT ARE WELL RUN IN

02:17:02.013 --> 02:17:04.015
VIABLE BUT OUR CONCLUSION OF

02:17:04.082 --> 02:17:05.984
THIS IS TO BE MEANINGFULLY

02:17:06.051 --> 02:17:07.519
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.

02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:09.421
MODERNIZING THE SERVICE DELIVERY

CONSOLIDATION AND

02:17:16.428 --> 02:17:18.330
REGIONALIZATION IS ABSOLUTELY

02:17:18.396 --> 02:17:19.364
ESSENTIAL.

02:17:19.431 --> 02:17:20.865
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY MODEL OF

02:17:35.246 --> 02:17:35.981
THAT.

02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:37.315
THE PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE THE

CONFIDENT SYSTEMS --

02:18:36.775 --> 02:18:38.076
THIS WOULD ELIMINATE REDUNDANT

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:39.277

FISCAL YEAR WE BELIEVE THERE'S

02:20:24.916 --> 02:20:26.951
REALLY AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY

02:20:27.018 --> 02:20:28.686

IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY.

02:20:40.498 --> 02:20:42.133
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE BENEFIT

02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.935
OF A TRUST FUND BY GENERAL FUND

02:20:44.002 --> 02:20:46.504
VERSUS A PER METER WATER CHARGE

02:20:46.571 --> 02:20:47.806
IS THAT IT USES A PROGRESSIVE

02:20:47.872 --> 02:20:50.308
REVENUE SOURCE WERE HIGH INCOME.

02:20:50.375 --> 02:20:52.677

MORE AND LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS

02:20:55.079 --> 02:20:57.482
ARE CONTRIBUTING MUST LESS THIS

02:20:57.549 --> 02:20:59.117
AVOIDS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT

02:20:59.184 --> 02:21:00.451
ON WHAT WE CALL OUR INCOME

02:21:00.518 --> 02:21:01.986

LEVEL UNDER A WATER FEE PROPOSAL

02:21:09.494 --> 02:21:10.862
THOSE RESIDENTS SHOULD NOT ONLY

02:21:10.929 --> 02:21:12.330
BE PAYING THE SAME AMOUNT IS

02:21:12.397 --> 02:21:13.998
SOME OF OUR MOST AFFLUENT

02:21:14.065 --> 02:21:15.533
CUSTOMERS AND RESIDENTS WOULD

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:17.001
ALSO BE ABSORBING SIGNIFICANT

02:21:17.068 --> 02:21:18.303
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

02:21:18.369 --> 02:21:19.671
THAT ALL THE WATER AGENCIES ARE

02:21:19.737 --> 02:21:21.206
GOING TO HAVE TO OCCUR --

02:21:21.272 --> 02:21:23.908
INKER TO IMPLEMENT COLLECTION OF

COUPLED WITH A STABLE AND

02:21:38.122 --> 02:21:39.791
RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE IS

02:21:39.858 --> 02:21:42.694
CRITICAL TO RESOLVING THIS

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.195
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

A LITTLE DETAIL TO HIS PROPOSAL --

02:22:02.247 --> 02:22:03.882
WHAT I SAW FROM THE CALIFORNIA

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:06.818
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES DISTRICT WAS --

02:22:06.885 --> 02:22:08.386
AMOUNT OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND

02:22:08.453 --> 02:22:09.787
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THE

02:22:09.854 --> 02:22:11.623
INTEREST OF WHICH WOULD BE

02:22:11.689 --> 02:22:12.824
SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY MILLION

02:22:12.891 --> 02:22:14.993
DOLLARS A YEAR I WOULD GAS.

02:22:15.059 --> 02:22:17.295
DEPENDING UPON.

02:22:17.362 --> 02:22:18.162
WHAT'S YOUR BONDS --

02:22:18.229 --> 02:22:20.298
YOU MIGHT INVEST IN IS THAT

02:22:20.365 --> 02:22:22.267
CORRECT IS THAT YOUR PROPOSAL

02:22:22.333 --> 02:22:23.902
THAT'S A OF CONCEPTUAL AMOUNT

02:22:23.968 --> 02:22:25.103
THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IN THE

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:27.772
PROPOSAL BUT AGAIN IT'S REALLY.

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:30.074
DEPENDENT ON HOW MUCH REVENUE IS

02:22:30.141 --> 02:22:32.076
THE GOAL TO BE GENERATED SO FOR

02:22:32.143 --> 02:22:33.311
EXAMPLE IF --

02:22:33.378 --> 02:22:36.781
YOU PUT TWICE THAT AMOUNT IN

02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:37.982
DOLLARS AND YOU LOOKED AT THOSE

02:22:38.049 --> 02:22:40.151
INTEREST EARNING SAY BE AROUND

02:22:40.218 --> 02:22:41.619
NINETY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:22:41.686 --> 02:22:42.787
AGAIN BEAR IN MIND THE WAY IT

02:22:42.854 --> 02:22:44.589
TRUST WOULD WORK IN THAT REGARD

02:22:44.656 --> 02:22:46.858
IT WOULD BE AN INFUSION FROM THE

02:22:46.925 --> 02:22:48.826
GENERAL FUND INTO THE TRUST.

02:22:48.893 --> 02:22:50.395
THE TRUST WOULD BE --

02:22:50.461 --> 02:22:52.330
IN THOSE ROOMS REVENUES WOULD BE

02:22:52.397 --> 02:22:54.499
INVESTED THEY DEVELOP INTEREST

02:22:54.565 --> 02:22:56.067
EARNINGS IN YOU'D HAVE A REVENUE

02:22:56.134 --> 02:22:57.035
TARGET.

IN GOOD FISCAL TIMES YOU'D BE

02:22:58.937 --> 02:23:00.905
JET GENERATING INTEREST EARNINGS

02:23:00.972 --> 02:23:01.572
IN EXCESS OF THAT REVENUE

02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:02.807
TARGETS --

02:23:02.874 --> 02:23:04.075
IN THAT MONEY WOULD REMAIN

02:23:04.142 --> 02:23:05.643
PORTION OF THE MANY WOULD REMAIN

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:06.711
IN THE TRUST.

02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:09.047
DURING DIFFICULT TIMES IN LOWER --

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:10.949
IN FINANCIAL DOWNTURNS YOU MAY

02:23:11.015 --> 02:23:12.083
NOT BE GENERATING INTEREST

02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:13.318
EARNINGS BUT YOU WOULD HAVE

02:23:13.384 --> 02:23:14.452
PREVIOUSLY GENERATING THOSE

02:23:14.519 --> 02:23:15.787
INTEREST EARNINGS AND THEREBY

02:23:15.853 --> 02:23:17.789
CREATING A STABLE REVENUE SOURCE

02:23:17.855 --> 02:23:19.424
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:20.692
PROPOSAL.

02:23:20.758 --> 02:23:22.327
OKAY I I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO PUT

02:23:22.393 --> 02:23:24.062
A LOT MORE AND AND A HUNDRED AND

02:23:24.128 --> 02:23:25.763
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN ORDER

02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:26.898
TO GET.

02:23:26.965 --> 02:23:28.232
SOMETHING LIKE THE HUNDRED AND

02:23:28.299 --> 02:23:29.033
FORTY MILLION THAT'S BEING

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:31.469
PROPOSED RIGHT NOW BUT WE WILL

02:23:31.536 --> 02:23:33.671
LEAVE IT AT THAT --

02:23:33.738 --> 02:23:38.109
SO I'M NOW LOOKING FOR QUESTIONS

02:23:38.176 --> 02:23:39.777

PASSION EARLIER --

02:23:48.453 --> 02:23:49.721
AND I THINK THAT IT'S NOT

02:23:49.787 --> 02:23:51.189
PASSION IT'S TIME TO GO HOME ON

02:23:51.255 --> 02:23:52.256
A REGULAR BASIS TELLING PEOPLE

02:23:52.323 --> 02:23:53.925
ANY TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

02:23:53.992 --> 02:23:55.093
AND THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO AND

02:23:55.159 --> 02:23:56.361
TELLING THESE COMMUNITIES I

02:23:56.427 --> 02:23:58.429
THINK WE AS A LEGISLATURE ANY

02:23:58.496 --> 02:23:59.998
DETAILS COMMITTEES THAT THE THE

02:24:00.064 --> 02:24:00.898

THESE OTHER ANY LONGER BUT I

02:24:02.367 --> 02:24:03.835
HOPE AS WE'RE DOING THAT WE'RE

02:24:03.901 --> 02:24:05.436
LOOKING AT THE TWO FOLD AND

02:24:05.503 --> 02:24:06.871
MISTER JONES IS TALKING ABOUT A

02:24:06.938 --> 02:24:08.106
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING

02:24:08.172 --> 02:24:09.540
ACTION IMMEDIATELY SO THESE

UP IN THIS PROBLEM WE'RE ALSO

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:16.381
LOOKING AT EMERGING IN TEN

02:24:16.447 --> 02:24:18.249
MINUTES WHAT IS KARIM SIX THAT

02:24:18.316 --> 02:24:19.584

02:24:26.924 --> 02:24:27.959
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IS

02:24:28.026 --> 02:24:28.960
GOING TO BE ENOUGH OR DO WE NEED

02:24:29.027 --> 02:24:30.461
TO ALLOW ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY IN

02:24:30.528 --> 02:24:32.030
THERE FOR THINGS THAT WERE NOT

02:24:32.096 --> 02:24:32.597
THINKING ABOUT BUT WILL BE

02:24:32.663 --> 02:24:33.564
EMERGING.

02:24:33.631 --> 02:24:36.167
DOWN THE ROAD BUT I DO HOPE THAT

02:24:36.234 --> 02:24:37.502
THAT WE COULD TAKE ACTION --

02:24:37.568 --> 02:24:38.970
I LIVE IN A DISADVANTAGED

02:24:39.037 --> 02:24:40.271
COMMUNITY.

02:24:40.338 --> 02:24:41.939
THAT HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:44.342
WHEN WE HAVE ALLOCATED FUNDS IN

02:24:44.409 --> 02:24:45.843
WE HAVE MISSED OUT ON THE STANDS

02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:47.278

HOPE WE'RE TALKING TO THOSE

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.448
COMMUNITIES WHO HAVEN'T BEEN

02:24:50.515 --> 02:24:51.549
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

02:24:51.616 --> 02:24:52.750
BOND DOLLARS FOR WHATEVER REASON

02:24:52.817 --> 02:24:54.018
EVEN THOUGH WE THOUGHT WE WERE

02:24:54.085 --> 02:24:54.952
GOING TO BE ABLE.

02:24:55.019 --> 02:24:56.587
