EYE OPENING IT WAS- ALMOST

00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:03.895
UNBELIEVABLE WE WERE WITNESS TO

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:08.566
A LOT OF BIAS- THEY FOR EXAMPLE

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:11.202

MEDICAL RECORDS- THEY HAD VERY

00:31:24.882 --> 00:31:27.151
LITTLE EVIDENCE FOR EXCITED

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:28.720
DELIRIUM IF WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:32.657
IT IS IF IT IS LEGITIMATE. AND-

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:35.059
THE HEARING OFFICER. VERY

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:37.095
BLATANTLY LED THE WITNESSES TO

SAY SPECIFIC THINGS FILLED IN

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:40.732
WHEN THEY WERE MISSING

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:43.868
SOMETHING- AND I'LL STOP RIGHT

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:47.171
THERE BERMAN OTHER THINGS-

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:48.806
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THANK YOU- I'M

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:51.843
ROBERT COLLINS. YOU KNOW THEY

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:53.177
WERE TO CRIMES COMMITTED THAT

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:55.213
NIGHT ON DECEMBER TWENTIETH OCT

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.315
TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:58.583
WAS THE EXCESSIVE FORCE THAT WAS

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.784
USED IN ANGELO WHICH IS A

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:01.853
COMPLETE UNNECESSARY. BUT THE

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:03.821
SECOND CRIME WAS THE CRIME OF

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.556
COVERING UP A COVER UP THAT

00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:06.824
BEGAN IMMEDIATELY THE FAMILY

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:09.727
HEARD THE NEXT- A FEW DAYS LATER

00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:13.197
CONTACTING THE ATTORNEY. THAT AN

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:16.000
INDEPENDENT COLLEGES WAS ALMOST

00:32:16.067 --> 00:32:17.702
A NECESSITY BECAUSE- WE DON'T

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.504
HAVE TRUST IN THE SYSTEM. TO BE

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.606
IMPARTIAL WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:25.243
AN AB SIXTY NO EIGHT. S. TO

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.778
CHANGE THE ROLE SO THAT THE

00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:28.513
SHERIFF IS NOT OVERSEEING WHICH

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:29.514
SHOULD BE A SCIENTIFIC AND

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.650
MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE EVEN

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:33.785
IF THERE'S ONLY A PERCEPTION OF

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:36.187
BIAS THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:37.989
GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE ARE IN

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.991
ITS OPERATIONS WE WANT THE

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:41.959
PUBLIC TO TRUST THE SYSTEMS THE

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.895
GOVERNMENT AND THEY CANNOT BE

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:46.230
TRUSTED WHEN THOSE INCREASE ARE

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:49.400
SUBJECT TO- TO THE AUTHORITY OF

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.769
A SHERIFF HOW IT MAY HAVE BEEN

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:53.071
CENTS A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:56.107
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WAY.

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:57.308
SO IT'S REALLY A COMMONSENSE

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:59.043
REFORM. AND IT BRINGS ABOUT

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.279
ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:03.281
OBJECTIVITY AND BELIEVE ME OUR

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:06.117
FAMILY HAS DEFINITELY SEEN. HOW

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.419
THIS PROCESS WAS NOT OBJECTIVE

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:12.457
TRANSPARENT- OR UNBIASED. IN OUR

00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:14.092
CASE IT WAS SO CLEAR THEY

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:16.027
CONTRADICTED HOSPITAL RECORDS

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:17.195
THAT CONTRADICTED EVERYTHING

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:19.897
THEY IGNORED SO MUCH EVIDENCE-

00:33:19.964 --> 00:33:22.467
IT'S JUST SO PATENTLY CLEAR SO.

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:24.535
WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR I THINK IS

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:25.703
A VERY COMMON SENSE REFORM AND I

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.638
THINK YOU'RE DOING IT FOR THE

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:28.673
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.042
ALL BE ABLE TO RELY ON.

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:33.111
ASSISTANCE GOVERNMENT- SO I SAID

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:34.479
THERE WERE TWO CRIMES COMMITTED.

00:33:34.545 --> 00:33:36.080
BUT BY PASSING THIS KIND OF

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:38.449
LEGISLATION YOU MAKE SURE THAT

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:39.117
FAMILIES LIKE OURS CAN GET

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:42.320
CLOSURE. AND CAN MOVE BEYOND THE

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:43.488
TRAGEDY THAT'S HAPPENED INSTEAD

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:45.323
OF LIVING THE NIGHTMARE OF.

TRYING TO- COMBAT AND CARE FIVE

00:33:49.026 --> 00:33:50.361

OFFICE HAS BEEN COMBINED WITH

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:48.085
THE CORONER'S OFFICE WHICH

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:51.823
REMAINS A CHOICE THAT THE COUNTY-BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MAKES

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:53.958
PURSUANT TO CURRENT STATUTE AND

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:54.759
FORTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE MADE

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:56.894
THAT CHOICE OVER THE YEARS. SO

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:58.096
THE VAST MAJORITY OF COUNTIES

00:34:58.162 --> 00:34:59.764
HAVE CHOSEN THAT MODEL TEN

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:01.699
COUNTIES HAVE DECIDED THEY DON'T

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:03.701
WANT THAT MODEL OR THAT THEY

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:04.902
WANTED TO CHANGE FROM SHERIFF

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:05.703
CORNER MODEL TO A SEPARATE

DO THAT AND THEY'VE DONE THAT.

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:11.542
THE CORNERS EXPERTISE IS

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:13.344
INVESTIGATION AND THAT'S THE

ROLE THEY PLAY THE CORNER DOES

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.982
NOT DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF DEATH

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:19.684
THE PHYSICIAN DETERMINES THE

CAUSE OF DEATH AND THAT IS THE

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:23.988
CASE IN EVERY DEATH

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:26.157
INVESTIGATION WHERE THERE IS A

CORNER INVOLVED IRRESPECTIVE OF

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:30.061
THE MODEL IF THERE'S AN ELECTED

00:35:30.127 --> 00:35:31.662
CORNER A PHYSICIAN DETERMINES

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:33.030
CAUSE OF DEATH IF THERE'S A

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:35.099
SHERIFF CORNER THE PHYSICIAN

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.734

SUICIDE HOMICIDE UNDETERMINED

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.307
THAT'S THE CORNERS

00:35:43.374 --> 00:35:45.510
DETERMINATION. THE CORNERS

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:47.545
EXPERTISE IS INVESTIGATION THE

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:49.547
CORNER DOES NOT MAKE A MEDICAL

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:51.549
DIAGNOSIS THAT'S THE JOB OF THE

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.317
MEDICAL DOCTOR IN EVERY DEATH

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:55.353
INVESTIGATION THAT IS OVERSEEN

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:57.655
BY A CORNER IN EVERY COUNTY

00:35:57.722 --> 00:35:59.323
IRRESPECTIVE OF THE GOVERNANCE

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.092
MODEL THEY CHOOSE IF THEY HAVE

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.627
AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINER

00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:04.695
A MEDICAL DOCTOR USUALLY A

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:05.997
FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST WITH

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:07.532
SPECIAL TRAINING DOES THE

FORENSIC AUTOPSY THAT'S ALWAYS

00:36:09.634 --> 00:36:11.235
THE CASE BUT DOCTOR ALWAYS DOES

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:13.671
THE AUTOPSY SO THIS NOTION THAT

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:15.439
A SHERIFF DOESN'T HAVE MEDICAL

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:18.009
TRAINING. IS ILLUSORY BECAUSE

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.610
THE CORNER IS NOT REQUIRED TO

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:21.245

MEDICAL REASONS FOR THE PERSON'S

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:30.021
DEATH. THAT'S IMPORTANT

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.756
DISTINCTION IN THIS CONVERSATION

00:36:31.822 --> 00:36:34.892
BECAUSE IT'S- IT. THERE IS THERE

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:39.931
IS NOT A QUESTION ABOUT SHOULD A

00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:42.433

MEDICAL DECISIONS THAT'S THE

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:47.772
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S AT ISSUE HERE

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:49.006
. THE CURRENT SURE OF CORNER

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:51.275
APPROACH UTILIZED BY CHOICE-

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.543
ENJOYS THE BENEFIT OF

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.145
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES

00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:55.313
SHERIFF'S OFFICES DO

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:57.248
INVESTIGATIONS THAT'S WHAT THE

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:58.983
CORNERS ROLE IS AGAIN THE

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.217
PHYSICIAN DETERMINES CAUSE OF

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:03.921
DEATH. IN SAN JOAQUIN THE

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:06.090
EXAMPLE BEARS ARE TWO THINGS ONE

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:07.825
THAT COUNTIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:08.960
TO MAKE THEIR DECISION ON HOW

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:10.661
THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR COUNTY

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:12.029
OFFICES ORGANIZED AND WHETHER OR

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:13.598
NOT THEY WANT TO COMBINE THE

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:15.433
OFFICE OF THE SHERIFF CORNER

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:16.734
THEY HAD COMBINED THOSE OFFICES.

00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:17.969
THEY DECIDED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:19.470
THEY NO LONGER WISH TO HAVE

00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:20.705
THOSE OFFICES COMBINED THEY WERE

00:37:20.771 --> 00:37:22.340
ABLE TO SEPARATE THEM AT THEIR

00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:23.608
CHOICE THEY MADE THE DECISION

00:37:23.674 --> 00:37:25.276
BASED ON ALL OF THE FACTORS OF

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:26.877
BARK. AND DECIDED THAT IT WAS

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:28.813
WORTH IT FOR THEIR COUNTY TO

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.648
MAKE THAT DECISION TO HAVE A

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:32.650
SEPARATE CORNERS OFFICE. SAN

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:34.285
JOAQUIN ALSO SHOWS THAT THIS

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:36.587
QUESTION OF MANNER OF DEATH. AND

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.356
CAUSE OF DEATH. THE MANNER IS

00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:40.191
THE CORNERSTONE OF YOU EVEN IF

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:41.258
SEPARATED FROM THE SHERIFF'S

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:43.260

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:45.062
AND ELECTED CORNER AN APPOINTED

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:47.298
CORNER. A MEDICAL EXAMINER. AT

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:48.532
THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT THAT

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:50.101
THERE ARE COUNTIES WHO UTILIZES

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:52.069
OPTIONS AND THAT'S THEIR CHOICE.

00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:53.237
FROM A GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:54.639
THIS BILLS HEAVY HANDED IT

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:57.541
DISREGARDS LOCAL CONTROL-

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.543
THERE'S NO MONEY IN THIS BILL.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:00.911
FOR COUNTIES TO STAND UP

00:38:00.978 --> 00:38:02.013
SEPARATE SHARE OF CORNER OFFICES

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:04.415
BUT IT REQUIRES THAT IT BE DONE-

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:05.783
WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MASSIVE

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.852
COST THIS WILL CREATE. THERE'S A

00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:09.286
QUESTION IN THE ANALYSIS WHETHER

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:11.022
OR NOT THE BILL INTENDS TO UPEND

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.556

SHARE OF CORE MODEL. IF IT

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:18.095
DOESN'T THEN THAT'S- VERY

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:19.664
HELPFUL BUT I BELIEVE THAT

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.198
THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:22.600
I DON'T WANNA SPEAK FOR THE

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:24.335
