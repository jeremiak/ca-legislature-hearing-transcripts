GONNA REQUIRE DILIGENT OVERSIGHT

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.281
OF ALL RESOURCE PLANNING AND

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.884
RELIABILITY BY STATE REGULATORS.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.486
ALL OF THESE ENTITIES ARE

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:47.920
REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.288
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.057

THE P. YOU SEE HAS DONE VERY

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.793
LITTLE HISTORICALLY TO REVIEW

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.728
THE PROCUREMENT PLANS SUBMITTED

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.501
I'M IN ORDER TO DETERMINE --

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:02.902
WHETHER THESE PLANS ARE ADEQUATE

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.904
AND TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.205
CLEAN ENERGY GOALS ARE ON TRACK

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:07.540
IF YOU SEE SIMPLY NEEDS TO

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:08.641
CONDUCT MORE MEANINGFUL REVIEWS

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.743

DEFICIENCY.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.747
I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.115
PROCESS IS BROKEN.

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:18.685
I'M IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN TO

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.720
TWENTY THIRTEEN COMPLIANCE CYCLE.

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.789
THREE DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.991
FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:25.558
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:26.359
TARGETS.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.493
THEY SUBMITTED REQUESTS FOR

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.030
WAIVERS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIVE

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.398
YEARS LATER -- THESE REQUESTS

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.133
WERE SUBMITTED SO FAR AFTER THE

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.702
COMPLIANCE DEADLINE THEY STILL

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:38.571
HAVE YET TO BE RESOLVED HERE IN.

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:39.272
TWENTY NINETEEN I'M THE PC

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:40.807
SHOULD NOT BE ASKED FIRST TO

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:41.908
WEIGH IN ON THE ADEQUACY OF

COMPLIANCE DEADLINES HAVE PASSED

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.580
SO WE THINK THIS BILL PROVIDES A

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:48.948
COMMONSENSE CHECK POINT.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.683
THAT ALLOWS FOR A STATUS REPORT

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.118
TO BE PROVIDED THAT IS

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.319
MEANINGFUL REVIEWED.

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:55.855
ON SB ONE FIFTY FIVE WOULD ALSO

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.290

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.561
OBLIGATIONS WITH THE 60%

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:02.495
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:06.332
TARGET THAT WAS ADOPTED JUST

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.234
LAST YEAR IN SB.

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:08.801
ONE HUNDRED BY THE RESOURCE

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:09.469
PLANS HAVE TO ADDRESS MULTI YOUR

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.640
OBLIGATIONS UNDER EXISTING LAW.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:15.775
WE TINK THAT THESE CHANGES

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.310
WOULD ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF THE

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.978
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.680

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.487
PS PROGRAM SO WE REALLY SUPPORT

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.287
THIS BILL THINK IT'S A

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:29.655
COMMONSENSE MODEST MEASURE

THEY GET SERVICES FROM ALL THREE

THEY HAVE ONE CENTRALIZED

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.847

TODAY NO SINGLE LOAD SERVING AND

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:51.796
TODAY IS LARGE ENOUGH TO PROCURE

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:54.332
LARGE SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE ON

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:54.966
THEIR OWN.

00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:56.167
THIS MEANS THAT WITHOUT ACTION

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:58.069
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION

00:28:58.136 --> 00:28:59.804
TO MEET THE STATE'S CARBON DE

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:01.106

TRANSMISSION PROJECTS.

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.424
DíAS ALWAYS BEST POSITION FOR

TO PROCURE TRANSMISSION PROJECTS.

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:26.030
THIS PROCESS COULD BE APPLIED

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:27.532
DIRECTLY TO BOOK ENERGY STORAGE

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.000
WHICH HAS A SIMILARLY LONG

DURATION CONSTRUCTION TIME.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.973
AND AN END HAS A COST ALLOCATION

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:37.142
MECHANISMS FOR FOR PROJECTS THAT

PROCESS.

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:50.027
ADDITIONALLY WE THINK THE COST

00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:51.829
OF THAT STORE SHOULD BE BASED ON

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.531

00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:06.043
YOUR COST SHOULD BE LESS.

DURATION BOOKSTORE JIM CALLIS.

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.233
ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE AT THE

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.335

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:36.274
AND WE'RE WORRIED THAT IT'S

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.909

GOT SOME BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:50.988
THAT HAVE NOT HIT THE MARKET YET

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.023

THE TIME TO BE ADDING ANOTHER.

00:36:36.994 --> 00:36:38.162
THREE TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:41.966
WORTH OF ASSETS INTO THE SYSTEM --

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:45.870
THIS PUMP STORAGE SYSTEM.

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:47.872
CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT BEEN TO

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.707
DETERMINE AS NEEDED -- IN OUR

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:51.309
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN WHICH I

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:52.376
THINK YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:55.546
EARLIER TODAY THIS BODY IN SB

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:56.581
THREE FIFTY PUT THAT FORWARD TO

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:57.882
BASICALLY DETERMINE WHAT IS COST

00:36:57.949 --> 00:36:59.884
EFFECTIVE AND WHAT ISN'T -- THIS

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.552
IS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AS

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:03.688
NEEDED IN TWENTY THIRTY NOR HAS

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:06.157
IT APPEARED IN THE CAL I ESOS

00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:08.192
TRANSMISSION -- PLANNING PROCESS

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:09.527
AND THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:10.928
WHAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO DO

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:13.230
HERE IS TO BASICALLY IDENTIFY

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:15.199
THIS RESOURCE AS NECESSARY AS A

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:17.201
NECESSARY TRANSMISSION ASSETS

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:18.803
WHICH WILL BE COVERED IN FOR

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.504
WORK REGULATED RATES.

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:22.740
YOU LOSE ALL CONTROL OVER THAT --

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.942
THE THE SOLICITATION LIMITS

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.911
COMPETITION -- THERE'S  THERE'S

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.479
A PHRASE IN THERE THAT HAS TO BE

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:30.281
AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS

00:37:30.348 --> 00:37:31.782
WHY THAT NUMBER IF SOMEONE HAS A

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:33.084
GREAT IDEA THAT'S SMALLER THAN

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.284
THAT.

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:35.720
WHY CAN'T THEY PLAY IT ALSO HAS

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:37.054
TO BE BUILT IN CALIFORNIA

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.789
ELECTRICALLY THERE'S NO REASON

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:39.890
FOR THAT IN THERE ARE RESOURCES

00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:41.525
AROUND THE WEST IT MIGHT BE ABLE

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.294
TO FILL THAT I GET THE INTEREST

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:44.895
IN TRYING TO GRAY CALIFORNIA

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:45.696
JOBS?

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:46.464
BUT THIS IS JUST.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.399
LIKE PUTTING A KICK ME SIGN --

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:49.867
ON THIS PROGRAM FROM THE FROM

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.702
THE COMMERCE CLAUSE SITUATION --

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.604
SO IT -- THAT THAT THAT IS A

00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:55.406
CONCERN -- SO IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:56.741
HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:58.676
MOVE FORWARD HERE LET'S MAKE A

00:37:58.743 --> 00:37:59.910
TRULY COMPETITIVE AND THE WAY

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:01.512
THIS IS STRUCTURED IN WRITTEN

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.414
IT'S NOT COMPETITIVE.

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:04.715
LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:06.417
LAST YEAR YOU ALL HEARD A LOT

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:07.785
ABOUT FROM SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:09.086
THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD NOT

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.588
EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA DEPENDED

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:11.789
SYSTEM OPERATOR.

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:13.758
BECAUSE A FORK -- THAT FOR

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:15.092
NETWORK IS GOING TO USE OF HEAVY

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:17.795
HAND TO BASICALLY TRY TO CONTROL

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.063
OUR RESOURCES HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.966
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PROJECT IS

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:23.668
FEDERALLY JURISDICTIONAL.

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:24.702
THE LICENSES FEDERAL

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:26.270
JURISDICTION IS CITED UNDER

00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:27.738
FEDERAL JURISDICTION THE I. S.

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:28.839
O. WHICH IS A FEDERALLY

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:31.175
REGULATED -- UTILITY IS REQUIRED

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:33.277
TO SOLICIT THIS RESOURCE AND ALL

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:35.413
THE RATE MAKING IS UNDER -- FOR

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.615
A JURISDICTION -- SO I KNOW --

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:38.716
IT'S FOOLISH OF ME TO ASK FOR

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.618
CONSISTENCY BUT I THINK THAT IF

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:41.952
WE'RE YOU KNOW IF WE'RE REALLY

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:43.421
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS LET'S NOT

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:49.326
BE LET'S NOT BE PICKING AND

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:51.095
CHOOSING BECAUSE THAT KIND OF

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:51.595
GOES FROM INCONSISTENCY

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:52.329
HYPOCRISY SO.

00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:53.431
I WOULD BASICALLY ARGUE THAT --

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:54.965
WE NEED TO GET OUR OUR OUR OUR

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.033
OUR BRAIN AROUND THAT I THINK

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.334
IT'S TIME TO SLOW THIS DOWN --

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:58.436
WE'VE GOT TIME TO LOOK AT THIS

00:38:58.502 --> 00:38:59.770
THE I. R. PETERS ANOTHER ONE

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.338
COMING UP MAYBE THIS WILL BE THE

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:02.740
SHOWS UP -- THERE ARE LESSONS TO

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:03.908
BE LEARNED ELSEWHERE THERE ARE

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:05.276
PUMP STANDALONE PUMP HYDRO

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:06.711
SYSTEMS THAT RUN INTO PROBLEMS

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:08.412
IN THE U. S. AND IN EUROPE AND I

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:10.214
THINK YOU ALREADY HEARD THAT --

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:12.650
MY UTILITY -- **** DECIDED THE

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:15.152
IOWA HILL -- PROJECT WAS A

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.353
LITTLE -- IT WAS A LITTLE RICH

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.688
IN A B. AND AND THAT SO WE

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:19.390
SHOULD LEARN FROM HIS EXPERIENCE

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:20.991
AND NOT YOU TO COMMIT OURSELVES

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:22.960
TO OTHER THREE TO TEN BILLION

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:29.734
DOLLARS -- IN NEW COST THANK YOU.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.534
PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:31.335
MINUTES WE TO LEASES AS ASIAN

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:32.203
REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC AND

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:32.703
ELECTED TO LISA PROVIDE

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.438
ELECTRICITY TO ABOUT 25% OF THE

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.339
STATE.

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:36.974
WE SHARE THE AUTHOR'S INTEREST

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.275
IN PROPONENTS INTERESTED IN A

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:40.945
STABLE LOW CARBON GRADE AND WE

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.446
BELIEVE THE ENERGY STORAGE IS

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:44.715
PART OF THAT SOLUTION.

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:49.019
BUT WE ARE OPPOSED SB.

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:49.653
SEVEN SEVEN TWO OUR MEMBERS ARE

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.188
OPEN TO PROCURING THIS TYPE OF

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:52.523
RESOURCE AND AS YOU HEARD SMALL

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.891
AT ONE OF OUR MEMBERS ACTUALLY

00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:55.626
LOOKED INTO THIS -- PROJECT HERE

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:58.429
IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA AND AND

00:39:58.496 --> 00:39:59.597
WOOD PROCURED IF IT MAKES

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:01.132
ECONOMIC SENSE TO DO SO BUT WE

00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:02.633
HAVE CONCERT SERIOUS CONCERNS

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.368
ABOUT BEING COLLECTIVELY FORCED

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:05.669
TO DO THE PROCUREMENT THROUGH

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:07.538

FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:14.078
AB WE AGREE WITH ANALYSIS THAT

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.212
THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.580
THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED HOW

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:18.149
MUCH IS NEEDED WHERE IS IT

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:20.017
NEEDED AND WHEN IS IT NEEDED WE

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:21.385
BELIEVE THAT MORE ANALYSIS AND

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:23.487
PLANNING IS NEEDED BEFORE MOVING

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:25.289
FORWARD ON THIS LEGISLATION.

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:26.157

THE THE EAGLE CREST PUMP STORAGE

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.516

FILL IN THE WORKPLACE FOR THREE

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:34.752
DECADES ALREADY WITH AN

IMPACTS AND AND TO TO THE BURKE

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:49.166
ISSUES THAT ARE EVEN OUTLINED --

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:50.067
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:51.468
THOUGH IS ANYTHING THAT REALLY

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:53.671
INCREASES COSTS TO RATEPAYERS --

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:56.340
ELECTRICITY -- ON THEIR BILLS

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:58.342
BECOMES A DISINCENTIVE TERM TO

00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.777
MOVE TOWARDS ELECTRIFICATION OF

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:03.347
COM THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN ONE OF

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:04.748
THE BIG INCENTIVES AND DRIVERS

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:05.983
FOR ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.252

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:09.453
THAT THAT ALTERNATELY WE ALL

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.754
KNOW WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:13.123
COSTS TO RATEPAYERS WILL HAVE

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.958
THAT THAT NEGATIVE IMPACT AS

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.693
WELL.

00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:17.161
UNLIKE THE SENT THE PROPOSED

PARTICULAR RELIES ON PUMPING

00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:27.604
AGING GROUND WATER FROM AN

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:33.944
AQUIFER THAT IS THE CASE IT'S

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:36.280
SOME IT'S BOUNDED ON THREE SIDES

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:38.115
BY THE NATIONAL PARK BY JOSHUA

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:48.292
IMAGINE.

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:48.859
WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE VERY

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.060
SENSITIVE ECOLOGICAL HABITAT

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:51.195
AREAS -- THE NATIONAL PARK

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:52.329
SERVICE'S IN THE BUSINESS OF OF

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:52.930
DEDICATING PARK SPACE -- FOR

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:54.064
AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE THIS AND

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:54.932
SO THE FACT THAT THIS IS BOUNDED

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:55.632
ON ON BRIEF.

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:56.867
ALMOST FOUR SIDES -- COMPLETELY

00:43:56.934 --> 00:43:57.901
BIVA AND THE NATIONAL PARK

00:43:57.968 --> 00:43:58.402
ITSELF.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.470
IS WHAT REALLY IS DRIVING A LOT

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:00.838
OF OUR OWN ANXIETY ON ON THIS

00:44:00.904 --> 00:44:01.839
PROJECT.

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:02.639
SO THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:04.375
RENDON TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT

00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:05.009
EAGLE CHRIS GROUNDWATER PUMPING

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.944
WOULD QUOTE BECAUSE DAMAGING

FROM AN ALREADY OVER DRAFT IT

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:11.348

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:12.616
WITH NO GROUND WATER RESEARCH

00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:14.451
COMPLETED BUT STATE THE NATIONAL

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:15.886

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:20.324
OPPONENTS CLAIM THAT THEIR

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:21.558
PROJECT WILL NOT HARM THAT IS A

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:22.326
ROCK FOR BECAUSE THE OPERAS

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:24.094
RECHARGE RATE IS THIRTEEN

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:24.862
THOUSAND ACRE FEET.

00:44:24.928 --> 00:44:25.763
BUT THE PARK SERVICE'S RESEARCH

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.898
ESTIMATES THAT THE RECHARGE RATE

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:30.300
IS LIKELY CLOSER 230-002-6000

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:32.269
ACRE FEET A YEAR -- THE FRACTION

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:39.076

IN JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK.

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.153
THIS KIND OF GROUND WATER MINING

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:49.853
WOULD BE IN VIOLATION

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.721
ESSENTIALLY IT TO SAY POLICY IN

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:03.133
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES SOME OF

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.101
WHICH WILL I'LL JUST QUICKLY

GOT TO DEAL WITH.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.608
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED IS

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:12.843
WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THIS KIND

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:14.311
OF EXISTENTIAL CRISIS IN A

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:16.680
COUPLE OF WAYS. ONE IS WITH THE

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:17.314
MIDDLE OF THIS TRANSITION WHICH

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:19.116
THE PROPONENTS OF THIS MEASURE

HOW DO WE DEAL WITH STORAGE.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.188
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE OUR

00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:26.289
RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT'S NOT

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:28.024
RELIABLE AND WE'RE CHANGING THE

00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:30.060
SYSTEM AND YOU GOTTA HAVE IT

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:30.961
MAKES TOTAL SENSE I GET IT.

00:50:31.027 --> 00:50:33.663
ON BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.766
QUESTION IS AT WHAT PRICE.

00:50:35.832 --> 00:50:36.666
AT WHAT PRICE.

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:38.268
ARMED WE NOW HAVE IS WAS

EXPRESSED THE COMPRESSION ON ON

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:45.842
RATES WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE IN

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:46.910
WILD FIRES BY.

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:47.911
WE'VE GOT THIS ISSUE WHERE DO

YOU WANT TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:50.113
TODAY I'M TOLD THE TAKES THREE

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.114
PLUS YEARS TO GET THIS PROJECT

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:53.183
BUILDS WHEN A AS THE ANALYSIS

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.851
POINTS OUT STAFF CONCLUDED THAT

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:57.988
THERE'S ENOUGH LEAD TIME BEFORE.

00:50:58.054 --> 00:50:58.588
TWENTY THIRTY UNDER THE FORTY

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:00.457
TWO MM T. SCENARIO THAT THE

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:01.858
PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES DO NOT

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:04.361
NEED TO BEGIN IN THIS AYE ARE

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:07.397
PETE -- CYCLE SO ISTHERE A NEED

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:08.365
WE'RE UP AGAINST THIS

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:10.400
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM I'M SITTING

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:11.735
HERE AND THEN SO WE'RE DOING TWO

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:14.070
BIG THINGS IN TRMS OF MOVING

FORWARD WITH THIS AT THIS TIME.

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:19.276
ONE IS WE ARE IS ICY AT WE NEED

00:51:19.342 --> 00:51:21.611
TO REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:22.712
RATE PRESSURES IN THE YOUNG

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:23.680
PEOPLE BECAUSE THE FIRES AND

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:24.915
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE.

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:27.951
IN TWO WE ARE WHETHER YOU CALL

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:30.220
IT STORAGE OR TRANSMISSION OR

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:32.556
WHATEVER WE ARE OPENING A VERY

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:34.758
BIG BACK DOOR TO THE FORK THAT

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.126
WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING.

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:37.928
FOREVER IN LETTING THEM COME IN

00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:39.896
AND SET RATES IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:42.098
THE FOUR DOES NOT CARE ABOUT.

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:44.568
THE UNDERLYING POLICY ISSUES

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:45.502
THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:46.903
CALIFORNIA THE FORK IS A

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.572
REGULATED BODY THAT'S JUST ABOUT

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:49.873
RELIABILITY WHICH IS AN

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.475
IMPORTANT ELEMENT WHAT WHAT THE

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.076
GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT IN HIS

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:55.612
REPORT ON WILDFIRES.

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:57.647
IS HE'S HAS FIVE POINTS ONE IS

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:59.249
THE RELIABILITY AND COST PEACE

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:01.952
BUT ONE ALSO IS PROMOTING OUR

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:03.220
CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES NOW

00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:04.955
CLEARLY WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

00:52:05.021 --> 00:52:06.256
DOING IS DOING THAT.

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:08.058
THE BALANCE HERE IN TERMS OF

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:10.327
WHERE WE ARE TODAY YOU KNOW I

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:11.928
KNOW EAGLE MOUNTAIN WELL I

00:52:11.995 --> 00:52:13.563
MEMBERS PRODUCT BACK TO THE WHAT

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:14.297
IT WOULD TAKE HIGH SCHOOL NO THE

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:15.265
PEOPLE FROM UP THERE AND BEEN

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:20.270
THERE MANY TIMES AND NOTE.

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:21.371
THIS PARTICULAR.

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:23.173
ALTHOUGH I RARELY AGREE WITH MR

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.009
WEIDEMANN WHO I SAW SPEAKER

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:28.044
TODAY.

00:52:28.111 --> 00:52:30.514
YOU KNOW I A THE ISSUE IS DO DO

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.715
YOU I I DO YOU AND I JUST REYES

00:52:31.781 --> 00:52:32.349
ONE COUPLE MORE POINTS HERE DO

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:34.584
YOU ACTUALLY NEED.

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:35.385
TO KNOWLEDGE THE ONE THING THAT

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:35.986
I'VE LEARNED BEING AROUND THE

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:37.053
RENEWABLE ENERGY BUSINESS FOR

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:37.487
THIRTY FIVE YEARS.

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:38.622
IS JUST THE EXTRAORDINARY RATE

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:39.923
OF CHANGE THE EXTRAORDINARY RATE

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.024
OF CHANGE THE REDUCTION IN COSTS

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:42.592
THE RATE OF CHANGE THAT'S

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:44.094
OCCURRING IN THE REAL BILL SPACE.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.297
AND YES THIS CLEARLY 1100% MEETS

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:49.132
OUR GOALS WHAT DO WE HAVE A

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:51.601
WINDOW OR NOT CAN WE TAKE THIS

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:53.770
UP NEXT YEAR AFTER WE HAVE SOME

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:54.704
MORE INTELLIGENCE HOMEWORK.

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:55.605
I DON'T WANNA THROUGH OUT THE

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:56.773
WINDOW BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.707
VALUE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT

00:52:57.774 --> 00:52:58.174
THAT.

00:52:58.241 --> 00:52:59.609
I JUST THINK IT RAISES THE

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:00.810
QUESTION ABOUT.

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:02.512
THE WILDFIRES I THINK IT RAISE

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:03.947
THE QUESTION ABOUT.

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:05.649
FOR YOU KNOW AND SO WHAT WE'RE

00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:06.349
DOING IS WE'RE BALANCING WE'RE

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:07.551
SAYING OKAY THIS BILL WILL

PRICE MATTERS TO PEOPLE IF THE

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:52.963
RATES GET TOO HIGH IF WE TAKE

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:54.798
ACTIONS TO ACHIEVE.

00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:55.265

WE'RE NOT SO SURE WE WANT TO DO

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:00.770
THAT.

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:02.238
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:04.140

HONORABLE ATTENTION SEARCH THIS

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:17.621
IS NOT A PROJECT WHERE PEOPLE

ARE SAYING -- WE WANT TO DO

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:20.657
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THEY ARE

BUT THAT'S RUNNING UP AGAINST

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:33.003
THESE OTHER DYNAMIC SO I JUST

SPEND.

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.614

AND TAKING THIS ISSUE ON IT'S

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.138
IT'S IT'S IT'S AN ISSUE NEEDS TO

00:55:08.204 --> 00:55:09.472
BE DISCUSSED THE MATTER THAT

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:10.774
NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.176
PUBLIC AND WE NEED TO DISCUSS

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:14.210
THE MERITS.

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:15.712
AND ALSO THE CHALLENGES FACING

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:18.648
IN OR OUR OUR ENERGY GRID.

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:21.351
I MEAN AS AS WERE AS WERE HERE

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:25.021
PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE WE HAVE.

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.423
YOU KNOW WHAT WILDFIRE SEASON

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:29.292
KIND OF APPROACHING QUICKLY.

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:31.494
AND WE'RE ALL WORKING VERY HARD

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:32.996
TO ENSURE THAT WE WE LESSEN THE

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.898
FIRES AND WE HARDEN THE GRID ALL

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:36.332
THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A COST.

00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:38.702
WE UNDERSTAND THATWERE GOING TO

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:40.103
HAVE TO SOMEHOW.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:41.871
GO BACK TO THE RATE PAYERS AND

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:43.573
AND ASK THEM TO BE PART OF THE

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.741
SOLUTION THAT'S A THAT'S GOING

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:45.842
TO BE A VERY HARD THING TO DO

00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:48.478
BECAUSE I ALREADY THINK.

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:50.380
THAT OUR OUR RATES ARE VERY HIGH

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:51.981
IN THE HAVE FINANCE THE

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:54.350
TRANSITION IT'S GETTING US TO A

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:54.918
BETTER PLACE.

00:55:54.984 --> 00:55:56.586
HELPING TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:59.589
HELPING TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:00.557
THINGS THAT ARE.

00:56:00.623 --> 00:56:01.958
I THINK THE CENTRAL TO OUR

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.027
SURVIVAL.

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:05.762
BUT AT THE SAME TIME.

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:07.764
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GET THE

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:10.166
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON BOARD.

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:13.103
WITH THIS WITH THIS -- WITH THIS.

00:56:13.169 --> 00:56:14.604
THE STRATEGY AND IT'S HARDER TO

00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:16.339
DO.

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:18.208
AS A STANDALONE STATE -- YOU

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:20.343
KNOW -- ONE OF FIFTY STATES --

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:21.911
TAKING AGGRESSIVE ACTION ON THIS

00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:24.380
AND EVERYONE ELSE DOES SEEM.

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:25.582
TO SEE THE SAME URGENCY THAT WE

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:30.453
DO -- AND THIS IS OF THIS POLICY

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.989
IS KIND OF RESULTING FROM THE

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:34.424
FACT THAT WE NEED A BALANCE

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:34.724
[inaudible]

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:36.326
OUR GRID.

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:38.261
REPAIRS -- IN MY NECK OF THE

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:39.896
WOODS ALREADY SEEN THE FAT FACTS

00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:42.332
OF AN IMBALANCE GRID -- RATES GO

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:43.867
UP ARE GOING UP IN THE EVENING

00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:46.336
NOW RATES GO DOWN DURING THE DAY.

00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:47.971
SO DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE YOU

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:49.906
HAVE TO ADJUST YOUR ENTIRE

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:52.008
LIFESTYLE TO KEEP YOUR BILL.

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.209
THE SAME.

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:54.644
AND IF THIS FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:56.846
A IT'S A CULTURE CHANGE IT'S AN

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:58.181
INCONVENIENCE.

00:56:58.248 --> 00:56:59.983
IT ALSO IS AFFECTING YOUR

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:01.751
QUALITY OF LIFE.

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:03.520
SO IF WE CAN WE CAN CREATE THE

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:05.755
PROJECTS THAT.

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:08.424
THAT HELPS BALANCE THAT.

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.460
I THINK PEOPLE.

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:11.995
WHAT WHAT WILL SUPPORT THAT BUT

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:13.663
AGAIN?

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.399
NO I I HAVE LOOKED AT I I HAVE

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:19.135
READ THE ANALYSIS AND SEEN --

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:21.738
THE RECOMMENDATIONS I I THINK

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.473
THE REASONABLE.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.874
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:26.643
UNDERSTAND.

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:29.279
WHAT THE PROPONENTS ARE ARE ARE

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:30.814
ARGUING FOR I MEAN REGIONAL I

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.049
SEEN THE COST TO THE STATE MAKES

00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:34.150
A LOT OF SENSE?

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:35.652
YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT GOING

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:37.287
THROUGH THE CHI SO AND THAT'S

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:39.088
THE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THAT

00:57:39.155 --> 00:57:40.690
AND IT MAKES SENSE I'D RATHER.

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:42.826
SHARE THE COST OF CREATING A

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:44.127
BALANCING WITH ALL OF

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:46.563
CALIFORNIAN AND JUST SAYING --

00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:48.898
ZANE DIEGANS WERE ONLY GONNA

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:52.068
SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF LOVE ONE

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:53.136
MAJOR PROJECT [inaudible]

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:56.072
SO. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:58.208
SAYING NO WE CAN DO BETTER I'D

I I HOPE I WANT TO COULD SEE

00:58:10.186 --> 00:58:12.188
THIS PROJECT CONTINUE FORWARD TO

ON THEM.

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:20.463
BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIND.

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:21.965
WE NEED TO FIND THE EFFICIENCY

00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:23.399
WE NEED TO FIND THE SAVING BUT

IS ACHIEVING TO OBTAIN WHICH THE

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:33.643
BALANCING OF OF THE WAY WE

WE WOULDN'T SEE THE FIRST

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:50.059
PROJECT. FOR THE VERY LEAST VERY

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:51.594
LEAST FIVE YEARS.

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:53.730
WHERE WE GONNA BE IN FIVE YEARS

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:56.165
DIFFERENT PLACE TO BE A GREATER

00:58:56.232 --> 00:58:59.402
SENSE OF URGENCY IN FIVE YEARS.

00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:01.504
THIS BILL IT GETS US OFF ON A

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:04.307
PATH THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.843

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:13.716
PARTICULAR.

00:59:13.783 --> 00:59:16.319
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A PROCESS BY

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:17.453
WHICH THESE PROJECTS ARE PROVING

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.788
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.189
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.

00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:21.724
AND THERE WILL BE A PROCESS TO

00:59:21.791 --> 00:59:22.558
APPROVE THAT.

00:59:22.625 --> 00:59:24.827
THIS THIS BILL TODAY DOES NOT

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:27.297
APPROVE ANY SPECIFIC ANYONE

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:28.665
PROJECT.

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:31.267

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.207
THEY STILL HAVE TO SHOW THAT

00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:40.343
THEY HAVE THEY WILL NOT AFFECT

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.145
THE ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA.

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:44.113
ARE WE WE HAVE A PROCESS FOR

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.549
THAT AND AND THIS BILL THIS BILL

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.251
DOES NOT WEAKEN THAT.

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.919
THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:52.322
THAT PROCESS OR WEAKENED IT OR

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:52.522
GIVE.

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:53.990
THESE PROJECTS.

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:56.192
OF ANY DIFFERENT STANDING

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:58.561
ENVIRONMENTALLY THAN THEY WOULD

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:02.765
OTHERWISE SO -- I WANT TO WORK

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:04.133
WITH YOU CENTER BRADFORD IN

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.269
TERMS OF ADVANCING THIS BILL AND

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:08.004
WORK WITH -- THE OPPONENTS OF

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:11.007
THIS BILL TO SEE IF THERE ARE.

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:12.675
BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS.

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:15.111
AS YOU SAY THAT THERE ARE.

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:17.280
AND IF YOU SAY WELL THIS IS NOT

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.048
THE BEST WAY TO NEVER MIND DON'T

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.984
DO AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S NOT

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.719
REALLY [inaudible]

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:26.155
OF A IS IN TUNE WITH WHAT THE

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:28.891
SITUATION WE ARE HERE.

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.827
IN OUR STATE I MEAN I HEAR OVER

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:33.363
AND OVER THE TOP CHART THE DUCK

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:34.697
CHART THE DUCK CHART.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:36.766
AND IF YOU'RE IN SOLAR THE DUCK

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.634
CHART IS YOUR ENEMY.

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.403
AND IF YOU FIND A WAY TO ADDRESS

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.705
THE IF YEARS SOLAR POWER IF

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:44.340
YOU'RE IN ANY KIND OF RENEWABLE

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:45.108
POWER THE DUCK CHART IS YOUR

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:45.942
ENEMY.

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.744
AND UNLESS YOU USE ALL THE DUCK

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.245
CHART THERE WILL BE NO.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.581
NEW PROCUREMENT.

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:52.982
IN THOSE INDUSTRIES.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:55.752
SO ARE THIS IS A TOUGH ONE AND

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.820
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A OF A LOT

01:00:57.887 --> 01:00:59.022
OF A CHALLENGES GOODNESS THROUGH

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:00.990
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND.

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:03.526
THIS IS A A A CONTROVERSIAL

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:07.497
PROCESS BUT I WANT TO HELP YOU.

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.665
AT LEAST ADVANCED ADVANCE THIS

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:13.169
OF AND SEE WHERE WE CAN GET --

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:14.270
TO THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF A

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:17.240
LOT OF BILLS COMING THROUGH THIS

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:18.741
YEAR AND A LOT OF ACTION.

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:21.344
ON ON WALL FIRES AND ON THE ON

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.680
ON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:28.551
OUR OF OUR OF OUR A LOT

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:30.787
ELECTRICAL COMPANIES.

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.388
SO THIS IS GOING TO GET INTO A

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:34.791
REALLY BIG MACS AND AND AT THE

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.526
END OF THE YEAR I HOPE.

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.027
THAT WE SUCCESSFULLY SORT IT OUT

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.629
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:40.997
TOUGH YEAR.

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.732
ON ALL THIS STUFF RELATED TO

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:44.500
ENERGY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT AND

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:46.502
OUR FORESTS.

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:47.837
AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO.

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.539
IT'S IT'S HARD TO DO FROM THIS

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:51.340
DíAS TODAY.

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:53.042
WITHOUT REALLY LOOKING AT

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:54.944
EVERYTHING IN COMBINATION BUT I

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:56.446
THINK.

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:57.046
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT OUR BEST

01:01:57.113 --> 01:01:59.315
SHOT THIS YEAR SENATOR SKINNER

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.184
FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DODD.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:05.021
AND SENATOR RUBIO AND THEN

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:07.457
CENTER STUFF START.

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.025
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:11.227
AND FORCE.

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:15.098
FORCED TO THE AUTHOR -- I

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.432
SUPPORT BALK [inaudible]

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:17.533
ENERGY STORAGE [inaudible]

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.737
AND MY PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS HOW

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:22.738
THE BILL'S CONCERT [inaudible]

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:25.007
IS THAT.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:26.642
IT IS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL.

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.878
AND IF WE IF OUR INTEREST IS

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.113
TRYING.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:33.516
TO CREATE THE PLEXIGLAS IT'S TO

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:33.983
BE ABLE TO DO THE BRIT

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.619
INTEGRATION -- THAT WE KNOW WE

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:37.920
NEED.

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:40.756
THEN I THINK -- SOME AMENDMENTS

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:44.060
OR AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW.

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:45.995
FOR MORE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.998
WHICH DOES NOT ELIMINATE.

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:52.068
I'M PUMPED HYDRO FOR ELIMINATE A

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:52.869
PARTICULAR PROJECT THAT MAYBE

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.270
BEING CONTEMPLATED IT DOESN'T

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:56.405
ELIMINATE THOSE BUT IT AT LEAST

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:57.507
IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOMETHING

01:02:57.573 --> 01:03:00.042
IN THE STATUTE.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.177
ALSO PROVIDES.

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.712
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:04.547
TECHNOLOGIES AND I THINK WHEN WE

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.949
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:08.751
TO DO -- YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:10.720
CRITICISM THAT THE ART PS WAS

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:13.089
NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL ENOUGH

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:15.825
BUT WE WE HAVE AT LEAST TRIED IN

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:17.260
OTHER OF OUR BILLS.

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:19.862
LIKE A TWENTY FIVE FOURTEEN THE

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.430
ORIGINAL STORAGE BILL. TO MAKE A

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:22.532
TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL NOW

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:26.035
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENED IS --

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:27.937
THE P. YOU SEE IN THERE

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:30.606
ADMINISTRATION OF IT EXCLUDED

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:31.774
PUMP HYDRO.

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:35.311
SO THE WITH THIS BILL.

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:35.878
WE COULD MAKE A TECHNOLOGY

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.847
NEUTRAL BUT STILL WE ARE SENDING

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:38.848
A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT WE ARE NOT

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:41.417
EXCLUDING PUMP HYDRO SO I WOULD

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.619
BE FAR MORE COMFORTABLE.

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:46.055
IF WE HAD -- LANGUAGE THAT DID

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.123
THAT.

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.926
AND ADDITIONALLY I THINK THE ARE

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:52.795
REQUIRING IT TO BE THE A CERTAIN

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:55.131
NUMBER OF MEGAWATTS IS PARTLY.

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:57.733
WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO IT NOT BEING

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.069
TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND I THINK

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:01.771
IN TERMS OF THE COST?

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:04.307
BY LOWERING THE MEGAWATTS BUT

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:07.009
ALLOWING SOME FLEXIBILITY TO GO

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.211
HIGHER [inaudible]

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:10.313
IF I'D.

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:11.681
THE R. P. YOUR I. SO SEIZE NEED

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:12.381
FOR IT.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:14.250
IT BEGAN DOES A LITTLE MORE RATE

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.551
PAYER PROTECTION.

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:17.420
AND THEN FINALLY THE CONCERNED

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:20.223
ABOUT FOR I THINK AND I SO IS

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:21.457
VERY LEGITIMATE WHEN I THINK

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.059
ABOUT LAST YEAR OUR DEBATE

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.628
AROUND -- WHETHER WE WOULD

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.996
REGIONAL I START THREADS.

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:29.298
AND IF YOU'RE THAT IF WE WERE TO

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:31.701
DISMANTLE THE CALL HI SO AS AS

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:35.204
IT IT IS CURRENTLY --

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:36.739
CONSTRUCTED THAT WE WOULD BE

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:39.475
INVITING BURKE FURTHER INTO OUR

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.445
DIRECTLY INTO OUR FAIRS.

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:43.412
WE KNOWN THAT.

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:45.448
FOR BASICALLY IS THE REGULATORY

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:47.483
AUTHORITY OF OUR CAL I SO.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:51.387
BUT ANYTHING WE EXPAND IN TERMS

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:54.390
OF THAT ROLE CAL SO I SO WE ARE.

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:57.660
IN FACT EMPOWERING FOR THAT MUCH

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:58.127
MORE.

01:04:58.194 --> 01:05:00.930
SO -- WHETHER IT WILL HAVE THE

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:03.399
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT SOME

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:04.233
FEAR.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.669
CAN'T DETERMINE BUT CERTAINLY IF

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:09.138
ARE CONCERNED IS THAT -- FIRST

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:10.673
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.942
CALIFORNIA'S INTERESTS NUMBER

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:13.909
ONE IT HARD.

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:14.443
IT IS.

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:17.847
IT IS -- IT CONSTITUENTS TURNING

01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:20.683
TO HAVE LANGUAGE THAT SO

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:28.324
DEFINITIVELY -- IT INVITES BURKE

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.359
IN THIS WAY SO THOSE WOULD BE MY

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.228
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:36.632
CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED.

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:37.633
KERRY HAD A BIKE AND SENATOR

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.602
SKINNER VERY GOOD POINTS -- IF I

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:40.336
COULD.

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:41.937
I'M SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:43.873
INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT IS MISSING

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:46.008
IN A REGULATORY GAP RIGHT NOW

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:47.243
OUR LARGE PROJECTS

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.845
INFRASTRUCTURE SCALE PROJECTS.

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:51.814
ARE TWO TWO LARGE FOR ANY LOAD

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:55.217
SERVING ENTITY TO PER CARE -- IF

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:56.552
WE MAKE THE PROCESS THE BILL

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:58.187
SMALLER THERE'S NOTHING IN OUR

01:05:58.254 --> 01:05:59.388
CURRENT MARK STRUCTURE THAT

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.424
KEEPS PEOPLE FROM BUYING SMALLER

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:02.958
SCALE PROJECTS TODAY.

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:05.027
ON THE P. YOU SEE ANALYSIS THAT

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:06.629
LOOKED AT THE THIRTY MILLION TEN

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:08.464
CARBON CENTER WHICH IS NOT THE

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:09.332
ONE THEY DOCTOR THEY DROPPED A

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:10.966
HIGHER CARBON TARGET SO FOR KIDS

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:12.535
STAYING AT HIGHER CARBON TARGETS

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:13.302
YOU DON'T YOU DON'T NEED THIS

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:13.969
BILL.

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.771
BUT IF FOR DRIVING TOWARD OUR

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:18.140
CARBON GOALS THERE IS AN

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:19.508
ANALYSIS OUT OF THE PC AND THE

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.377
CDC THAT TALKS ABOUT THE NEED

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:22.845
FOR STORAGE TO SUPPORT FOR

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.380
INCREASES IN SOLAR.

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:26.482
THE ECONOMY'S THE COST

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:27.950
EFFECTIVENESS.

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:29.485
OF BOOK ENERGY STORAGE WHICH IT

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:32.755
FOUNDED EVERY SCENARIO. FOR

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.390
AGGRESSIVE CARBON REDUCTIONS WAS

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.492
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE OPTIONS

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.194
THAT WAS BASED ON SIZE.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.562
SO WE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:41.430
MARKET KEEPING SMALLER PROJECTS

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:43.466
OUT TODAY IN FACT THIS IS A

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:44.767
SMALL PROJECT MARKET.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:45.735
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:47.436
CAPTURE THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:49.672
LARGE PROJECTS THAT'S WHY YOU

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:50.806
NEED THIS BILL.

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:52.541
SO I WOULD ALSO POINT ON THAT ON

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:54.276
THAT DEFINITION THAT WAS A

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:53.362
BACKGROUND.

01:13:53.428 --> 01:13:56.198
I'M IN SUPPORT OF THANK YOU

IN IN IN YOUR AND THE THRUST OF

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:04.540
IT.

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:07.709
IN TERMS OF NEED TO SOLVE THIS

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.611
PROBLEM.

01:14:09.678 --> 01:14:12.748
THE GAP THE DUCK CURVE -- THE

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:15.250
BROADER SORT OF QUESTION ABOUT

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:17.286
HOW TO GET THIS BE ONE HUNDRED

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:22.558
AND SOME -- JUST HOW DO YOU GET

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:23.225
THERE I MEAN REALLY I MEAN THAT

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.660
THAT'S YEAH I DON'T THINK WE

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:25.761
SOLVED THAT AND WE SOLVE MAYBE

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:29.264
THEY'LL LIKE 80% OR 65% I STILL

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:32.467
THINK WE SOLVE THE HUNDRED SO.

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.002
HI I DON'T I'M I'M A LITTLE.

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.737
I HESITATE ABOUT THE NUMBER

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:37.806
THOUGH I THINK IS FOUR THOUSAND

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:39.942
EVEN ENOUGH LIKE I I'M I'M

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:41.310
CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT.

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:42.778
WHAT'S DRIVING THAT ANSWER THE

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.146
TIMING THAT WAS MY FIRST

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:45.781
QUESTION FOR YOU ALL LIKE WELL

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:46.448
HOW DID HOW DID YOU GUYS COME OF

01:14:46.515 --> 01:14:48.317
FOURTH. THOUSAND I MEAN IF IF

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:50.519
THE POPULATION KEEPS INCREASING

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:51.453
LIKE.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.087
THEIR CHANCE WE'RE GONNA NEED

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:55.324
MORE AFTER THAT.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.792
TWENTY THIRTY OR EVEN MORE

01:14:56.859 --> 01:14:59.294
BEFORE TWENTY THIRTY IT JUST ONE

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:01.263
FOR SUCH AS NO THE LOGIC OF THAT.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.865
AND CENTER SENT THANK YOU FOR

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:05.234
THE QUESTION I AM SO

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:05.534
[inaudible]

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:08.737
THE ANALYSIS IN THE STATE

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:11.139
WHETHER IT'S THE CPUC OR THE CC

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.608
DID SOME REALLY GOOD WORK LAST

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:13.442
SUMMER AND THEIR DEEP DEEP

01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:15.043
CARBONIZATION STUDY THAT LOOKED

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:16.511
AT CARBON TARGETS ACROSS OUR

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:19.414
ECONOMY -- IN THE FOUR THOUSAND

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.350
IS DERIVED FROM THOSE TO THE CCC

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:24.586
THE CPUC STUDY LOOKED AT TWO

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:25.220
THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND BASED

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:26.288
ON A THIRTY MILLION TIME CARBON

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:29.157
TARGET MEMBER WORDS ZERO NOW

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:29.892
AFTER SB.

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.193
ONE AND SO THEY FOUND THAT THE

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.227
DIFFERENCE BUT WHAT'S THE

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.263
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO ONE FOUR

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:34.863
THOUSAND IT'S THE AMOUNT OF

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.064
ELECTRIFICATION WE HAVE IN OUR

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:37.332
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:39.001
PREDOMINANTLY AND HOW MUCH

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:39.568
NATURAL GAS WE KEEP ON THE

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:40.569
SYSTEM.

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:42.671
SO THAT FOUR THOUSAND IS

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:44.506
SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL -- IT WAS

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:46.108
ASSUMING REALLY TECH THEY WERE

01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:48.110
LOOKING AT PUMP STORAGE NOT THE

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:49.244
BROADER SET OF LONG DURATION

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:50.812
STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.180
COME FRWARD.

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:53.148
AND THAT WAS JUST BASED ON

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.350
GEOGRAPHY PUMP STORAGE IS YOU

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:56.985
KNOW GEOGRAPHIC LOGICALLY DRIVEN

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:58.086
AND SO IT THEY LOOKED AT THE

01:15:58.153 --> 01:15:59.521
NUMBER OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:00.188
EAT THREE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:01.757
PROJECTS IN THE FORK LICENSING

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.025
AND SAID FOUR THOUSAND IS THE

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:05.527
GEOLOGICAL MAX IN THE STATE.

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:07.496
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU

01:16:07.562 --> 01:16:08.497
WON'T NEED MORE LONG DURATION

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:09.932
STORAGE IT DOESN'T MEAN OTHER

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:11.700
TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT NOT COME

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:12.467
FORWARD AND COULD SOLVE THE

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:13.302
PROBLEM.

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:15.504
BUT I THINK I THINK YOU'RE YOUR

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:16.972
POINT IS REALLY WELL TAKEN.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:18.407
HOW WE GONNA GET THERE BECAUSE

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.808
THIS IS NOT THE SILVER BULLET

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:23.845
RIGHT IF YOU ADOPT THIS BILL?

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:24.880
THAT'S IT'S GONNA ESSENTIALLY A

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:26.315
QUAKE TO ABOUT THREE POINT THREE

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:27.749
MILLION TONS OF CARBON REDUCTION

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:30.652
A YEAR WHAT SEVENTY TWO GOING.

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:32.654
TO ZERO SO THIS IS.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:34.489
ONE OPTION AMONG MANY YOU'RE

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:35.857
GONNA NEED ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:37.292
YOUR NEED TO MANNER SPONSORED

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.227
ANY BETTER OPTIMIZATION IN OUR

01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:40.395
MARKET.

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:41.563
WE'RE GONNA NEED A DIVERSITY OF

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:43.231
OUR RENEWABLE RESOURCES FOR CAN

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:44.933
MEET A LOT OF THINGS INCLUDING

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.702
SOME SHORT DURATION STORAGE IN

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:47.869
SOME LOCATIONAL FOR MARCH.

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:49.204
SO THIS IS JUST ONE AMONG

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:50.539
MANAGER.

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:53.108
SO SO THE OTHER TWO ISSUES THAT

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:53.976
BEEN RAISED BY THE MEMBERS I

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.010
MEAN I IS THERE A PATH HERE CAN

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.378
WE CAN WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT AT

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.080
LEAST SOME WAY TO STRUCTURE THIS

01:16:58.146 --> 01:16:58.947
WHERE.

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.515
WE'RE NOT ARBITRARY CAPPING OURS

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:01.817
ARBITRARILY CAPPING OURSELVES

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:02.818
WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:04.619
PROPORTIONALITY ISSUE WHICH I I

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:08.256
I APPRECIATE WHAT THE THE MUNY

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:09.958
EASIER SAY IN AND SORT OF WE

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.026
DON'T WANT THIS SOME SORT OF A

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.394
IT'S IT'S GONNA BE UNEVEN WHO

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:13.795
WHO NEEDS WHAT.

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:15.197
AND SO I'M I'M SENSE IT I THINK

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:16.865
ACTUALLY WIND BROUGHT IT UP TO

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:19.534
THAT SORT OF TAILORING IT TO TEN

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:20.202
NEED AND THAT SORT OF

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:22.371
PROPORTIONALITY CONCEPT.

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:23.939
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE BLOWS UP

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:24.940
THE BILL.

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:26.575
THE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY SEEMS

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:27.876
LIKE THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:29.077
SPACE I DON'T THINK FRANKLY YOU

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:30.912
WANNA SINGLE PROJECT BILL AND I

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:32.247
THINK THAT.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:33.915
GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT.

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:36.118
THAT -- AND I I APPRECIATE YOU

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:37.252
MENTIONED COMPRESSED AIR STORAGE

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:39.588
BUT YOU'RE HERE SO I JUST THINK

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:43.859
FOR THE INTEREST OF FOR JUST HOW

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:45.093
WE MOVE POLICY.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.795
WE SHOULD TRY TO FIGURE THAT ONE

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.663
OUT LIKE WHY DAILY CYCLE OF

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:51.800
DISCHARGE LIKE WHY IS THAT THE

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:54.870
THE METRIC -- WHY A FOUR HUNDRED

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:57.539
AND NOT THREE HUNDRED OR TWO

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:58.473
HUNDRED FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED OR

01:17:58.540 --> 01:17:59.441
I MEAN I I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.210
SAYING SMALL CAN GET IN NOW BUT?

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:03.545
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT ONE ALSO

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.213
FEEL SORT OF ARBITRARY AND PUMP

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.082
STORAGE ORIENTED SO DOES THE

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.949
FOUR THOUSAND YOU SAID THE FOUR

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.584
THOUSAND DRIVE FROM A FOR PROMPT

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:10.485
STORAGE.

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:12.020
STATE ANALYSIS AND THEN LET'S

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:13.522
JUST LET'S SHADOW THAT LET'S

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:14.890
HAVE THIS RELIABILITY

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.425
CONVERSATION MAKE THIS THING IS

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.193
SOME WE CAN BE PROUD OF I MEAN I

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.561
I WANT TO VOTE FOR THIS THING I

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:19.761
JUST.

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.029
I NEED TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:22.364
WERE YOU GUYS WOULD WANT TO GO

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.166
HERE AND HOW GRANULAR YOU WANT

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:25.267
TO GET TODAY AND I DON'T WANT TO

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.668
CONTRAVENE THE CHAIR EITHER IN

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:28.170
ANY WAY I MEAN I JUST.

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:29.671
I WANT A LITTLE MORE CERTAINTY

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:31.673
BEFORE I VOTE AS OPPOSED TO JUST

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.340
LIKE ALL RIGHT.

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:36.411
THUMBS UP AND THEN OFF WE GO SO.

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:37.879
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MAN TO TO

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:38.613
ALL THOSE QUESTIONS TODAY WERE

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.816
NOT WE DON'T HAVE THAT BUT IT'S

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.050
THE ONGOING DISCUSSION A

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:43.385
COMMITMENT WE MADE AND IT'S

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:44.820
REFLECTED IN.

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.321
THE CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS AS WELL

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:49.357
THAT WE'RE COMMITTING TO WORK.

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:50.926
WITH ALL OF THE OPPOSITION AS

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.828
WELL SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL THE

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:54.362
WEEK WEEK WE'VE BEEN PROMISED A

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:55.764
THREAD THE NEEDLE.

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:58.200
AND ADDRESS EVERYTHING TODAY BUT

01:18:58.266 --> 01:18:59.768
WE'RE CONTINUING AS WE ALL KNOW

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:01.136
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND

01:19:01.203 --> 01:19:03.004
ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:04.940
SOMETHING AS COMPLEX AS THIS

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:06.608
THERE ARE SO WE'VE HEARD TOO

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:10.245
CONCERNED VERY CLEAR AND IT'S

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:11.580
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MISTER MAY

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:11.780
THAT.

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:13.949
WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO TO MOVE

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:15.517
FORWARD AND THAT'S A COMMITMENT

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:16.184
I CAN MAKE THAT WE WERE.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:18.253
WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO ADDRESS ALL

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:18.820
THOSE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:19.888
RAISED.

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:21.456
I JUST I NEED MORE I CAN'T I

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:22.891
CAN'T GET THERE I CAN'T GET

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:24.459
THERE IN THIS I KNOW.

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:25.961
THAT WE'RE NOT LIKE SOME OF THE

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:27.362
I KNOW THE FINER POINTS ARE HARD

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.297
TO DRILL DOWN ON RIGHT HERE FROM

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:30.932
THE DICE BUT LIKE.

01:19:30.999 --> 01:19:33.068
I CAN'T I CAN'T BE THERE UNLESS

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:34.736
I KNOW WHERE THESE HAVE A SENSE

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.238
EVEN FROM THE SPONSORS OR OR

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:37.139
LABOR WHOMEVER.

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:39.141
WE WANT TO BUILD YES WE WANT TO

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:46.314
DO LONG DURATION BOOKSTORES YES.

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:47.983
BUT TOO MANY TIMES EVEN TODAY

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:49.451
THE WORD PROJECT HAS BEEN SET.

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:50.719
AND THAT'S NOT THAT DOESN'T WORK

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:52.354
LIKE I PEOPLE ARE SLIPPING --

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.256
PROJECTS WITH THE KIDS IN

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:55.790
PROJECT THOUGH THOUGH HE FALLING

HAVING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.298

OUR PS BILL AND WE CONSCIOUSLY

01:21:17.939 --> 01:21:20.375
MADE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE BUCKETS

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.776
AND HOW CAN STE -- RESTRICTIVE

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:24.312
IT IT WAS AND HOW -- TECHNOLOGY

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:27.716
SPECIFIC IT WAS IN PER SCRIPT IF

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:29.417
IT WAS AND I WAS TRYING TO

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:32.354
BROADEN THAT DISCUSSION AND SAY

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:36.157
LET'S ADD IN RUN OF HYDRO FROM --

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:39.160
BC ALL NO WE CAN'T HAVE THAT

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:39.794

HAVE THAT IT ALL HAS TO BE IN

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:43.765
STATE AND WE'RE HERE TODAY

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:44.733
BECAUSE OF SOME THE CONSTRICTIVE

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.901
RESTRICTIVE LEGISLATION THAT WE

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:48.503
PASSED IN A FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:53.642
WHEN WE STARTED THIS WHOLE OUR

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:53.842
P. S..

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:55.410
DISCUSSION.

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:57.145
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOW

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:57.912
FIGHTING AMONGST EACH OTHER AT

01:21:57.979 --> 01:21:58.880
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WORK FOR

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:00.181
UTILITY I REMEMBER THE SAME

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:01.516
ENVIRONMENTAL.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.918
FRIENDS WHO ASKED FOR RENEWABLE

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.186
ENERGY TO ASK FOR WIND AND SOLAR

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:07.389
WERE THE SAME ONES WERE OPPOSING

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:09.991
THE TAX SHOULD BE POWER LINES

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:11.459
AND THE SUN RISE POWER LINES ON

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:12.127
A TO AND YOU'RE GOING.

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.094
TO HAVE TO BE BUT HOW DO WE GET

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:14.229
THE POWER FROM WHAT WE BUILT THE

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.297
SOLAR FARMS TO THE PEOPLE WHO

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:16.364
NEED IT SO.

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:17.932
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THAT

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:19.467
DANCE BETWEEN.

NOW THE SAID?

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:43.525
REPAIRS ARE ALWAYS AT THE FRONT

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.060
OF DISCUSSION AS WE TRY TO

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:46.695
EXPAND WHAT WE STARTED.

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.596
AND WHAT STARTED OUT AS

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:51.132
SEVENTEEN CENT A KILOWATT HOUR

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:53.702
ON SOLAR IN SOME PLACES WAS

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:55.737
TWENTY FIVE WE ARE NOW DOWN TO

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.572
FIVE CENTS A KILOWATT BECAUSE OF

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:59.941
TIME AND GROWTH IN INDUSTRY TO

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.142
GROW.

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.043
SO AGAIN.

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:05.380
FIRST PROJECT WON'T COME ONLINE

TO TWENTY THIRTY WILL HAVE.

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:08.316
PLENTY TIME TO ADVERTISE THIS

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:10.218
AND AND AND AND AND AND AND COST

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.654
IT OUT TO SEE WHAT IT IS WE'RE

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.723
NOT TRYING TO IMPACT REPAIR.

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:17.759
LE HAS IMPACTED REPAIRS OF THE

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:20.729
LAST TEN YEARS AS OUR MOVE FROM

01:23:20.795 --> 01:23:22.130
COMBINED HEAT AND POWER ARE

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:24.666
MOVED FROM A GAS ARE MOVED FROM.

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:29.037
HYDRO TO WIND AND SOLAR THAT'S

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:29.704
WHAT DROVE UP TO COST.

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:47.756
OUR DESIRE TO BECOME GREEN

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:52.761
CLEAN

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:55.196
AND EFFICIENT.

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:56.431
IT IS A COST FOR THAT.

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:57.932
AND IT'S GONNA BE A COST FOR

01:23:57.999 --> 01:24:01.102

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:10.478
FACTORY AND AGAIN I TO RUSH TO

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:11.980
NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL COME

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:14.449
BEFORE US AND WE'LL HAVE THAT

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:15.350
SAME DISCUSSION AGAIN.

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:18.286
AS TO HOW DOES IT WORK WHO PAYS

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:20.121
FOR IT YOU KNOW.

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:22.590

REMEMBER SENATOR SKINNER WHEN

THE HALF OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HAD

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:55.336
TO CONTEND THE DEAL WITH THESE

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:57.705
OVER THE YEARS.

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:00.475
THERE WILL BE MANY.

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:03.378
BILLS PROPOSED TO ADDRESS IT.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.946
THIS ONE ADDRESSES.

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.314
A PARTICULAR AREA.

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:07.715
BY REQUIRING THE ELECTRICAL

CORPORATIONS.

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:10.585
TECHNICALLY INVESTOR OWNED

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:12.453
UTILITIES. TO REPLACE THE ABOVE

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.789
GROUND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS.

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:15.957
WITH UNDERGROUND RELIANCE

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:17.225
WHEREVER THIS MIGHT BE

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:19.694
PHYSICALLY.

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:21.162
POSSIBLE AND FEASIBLE.

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:23.431
IN AREAS WHERE IT WOULD BE OF

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:24.866
GREATEST HELL.

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:29.404
AND CONSISTENTLY SB. NINE OH ONE

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.772

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:32.106
PLACE.

01:28:32.173 --> 01:28:33.474
IT ALSO WOULD CREATE A WORKING

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:35.777
GROUP TO ASSIST IN DIRECTING THE

01:28:35.843 --> 01:28:38.112
IMPLEMENTATION.

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:41.449

FUND DOLLARS. FOR THAT

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:50.358
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

01:28:50.425 --> 01:28:54.228
AGAIN I EMPHASIZE THAT. TO CUT

01:28:54.295 --> 01:28:56.164
DOWN ON THE DISASTROUS WILDFIRES

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:57.965
MANY THINGS ARE GOING TO BE

01:28:58.032 --> 01:28:59.434
HAPPENING.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.102
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.570
THEY WILL ALL FIT TOGETHER

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:04.572
HOPEFULLY [inaudible]

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:07.075
TO LESSON.

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:09.043
THE BURDEN AND THE COST.

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:12.380
WHAT'S YOUR INCREDIBLE.

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:14.482
FIREFIGHTING COSTS OF THIS YEAR

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:16.451

JUST DEALING.

01:29:29.964 --> 01:29:33.434
WITH LAST YEAR.

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:36.404
MANY OF THESE FIRES OVER DECADES

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:39.307
HAVE BEEN IGNITED.

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:40.241
BY THE YEAH FOR STRUCTURE

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:42.877
FAILURES.

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:47.115
LINES COMING DOWN FOR EXAMPLE

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:47.415
[inaudible]

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:49.250
PARKING FIRES.

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:51.686
THAT WAS A CONCERN.

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:54.889
AND THE DOOR.

01:29:54.956 --> 01:29:59.227
IN THE CAMP FIRE.

01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:01.095
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THEN.

01:30:01.162 --> 01:30:02.363
OUR SAFETY TO THE DEGREE THAT WE

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:04.165
CAN [inaudible]

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:07.435
AND THE ASSURANCE OF CONTINUED

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:09.570
SERVICE WHICH IS ALSO BEEN VERY

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:11.973
DISRUPTED THIS YEAR AND VERY

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:15.209
PROBLEMATIC.

01:30:15.276 --> 01:30:16.644
WOULD LIKE TO TRY.

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.412
TO REDUCE THESE HAZARDS AND

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:21.415
OPPORTUNITIES BY UNDER GROUNDING

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:22.650
WHERE WE CAN'T.

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:24.385
THEY'RE ALWAYS CONCERNS ABOUT

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:26.087
UNDER GROUNDING IN THE COSTS BUT

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:28.156
I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO WEIGH

01:30:28.222 --> 01:30:29.824
THESE CONCERNS.

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:32.960
WITH THE OVERALL MACRO COSTS IN

01:30:33.027 --> 01:30:34.996
MANY FRONTS [inaudible]

ARE IMPOSING ON US.

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:40.635
AND CONSIDER.

WHAT? TO WHAT DEGREE THE

01:30:44.806 --> 01:30:46.507
UNDERGROUND AND WILL ALLEVIATE

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:50.278
SOME OF THAT VULNERABILITY.

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:53.114
IT ALSO WOULD HELP US WITH THE

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:55.516
COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWNS THERE

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:57.652
HAVE BEEN SO SEVERE WITH MANY

01:30:57.718 --> 01:31:00.354
COMMUNITIES REMAINING ISOLATED

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.156
FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME FROM

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:03.958
THEIR COMMUNICATION.

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:05.827
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:08.663
IT'S SO IT'S A WAY OF HARDENING

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:08.963
[inaudible]

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.666

BEEN SPENT AND UNDERSTAND THAT

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.976
THIS IS IMPACTING OUR RATE

PAYERS.

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:25.980
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:27.582
IS A MACRO EXPENSE.

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:29.984
THE STEALTH EXPANSE.

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:30.918
BUT A HUGE.

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:34.388

BY SYSTEMS LIKE THE WE ASSIST

THE MOST PRECISE.

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:56.236

NOW THE PC DOES NOT HAVE A ROLE

01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:03.203
IN EMERGENCY ALERTS THAT IS A

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:04.271
ROLE THAT IS GIVEN TO THE OFFICE

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:05.138

EFFICIENCY OF COORDINATION WITH

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:44.844
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THE WORDS

01:49:45.912 --> 01:49:47.847
WE WOULD SAY THAT THIS MEASURE

01:49:47.914 --> 01:49:50.016
IS PREMATURE AT THIS TIME.

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:50.984

FACT THAT WITH SB EIGHT THIRTY

01:50:27.554 --> 01:50:28.788

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:30.957
APPROACH TO LOOKING AT LOCAL

THERE'S NOTHING THAT THIS BILL

REQUIRES THAT CAN'T BE DONE

01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:42.769

I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS

01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:38.958
BRIEF FIRST LET ME COMMEND THE

ONE THAT WE WOULD ALL SUPPORT.

01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:46.166
IN FACT SECTIONS ONE TWO AND

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:47.734
THREE WE OF THIS BILL WE THINK

01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:50.970
ARE ARE IMPORTANT AND USEFUL FOR

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:53.173
CONTINUED EXPANSION OF EMERGENCY

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:54.340
ALERTS TO CITIZENS.

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:57.577
ARE OBJECTIONS ARE IN SECTION

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:58.845
FOUR AND IN SECTION.

01:51:58.912 --> 01:51:59.979
FIVE PREFERRED TO THE ISSUE OF

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:01.548
FLIPPING THE PRESUMPTION.

01:52:01.614 --> 01:52:02.715
THE SENATOR COMMENTED ON THE

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:04.317
NEED FOR PROTECTING PROPRIETARY

01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:06.086
NETWORK INFORMATION THE P. YOU

01:52:06.152 --> 01:52:08.421
SEE RECENTLY WITHIN THE LAST TWO

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:11.424
YEARS ADOPTED NEW RULES NEW

01:52:11.491 --> 01:52:14.194
PROCEDURES -- SIXTY SIX D. THAT

01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:16.729
OUTLINES DUE PROCESS FOR THE

01:52:16.796 --> 01:52:18.098
PROTECTION OF INFORMATION.

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:19.866
IT IS WORKING EVERYONE

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:22.135
PARTICIPATED AND SO BOTH THE

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:23.803
PUBLIC AS WELL AS REGULATED

01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:25.972
ENTITIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:28.341
WORK THROUGH CHALLENGES SO WE

01:52:28.408 --> 01:52:30.977
BELIEVE PRESERVING THAT SYSTEM.

01:52:31.044 --> 01:52:32.645
A WORKING SYSTEM PROTECTS THE

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:34.914
CONFIDENTIALITY AND LIMITS

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:35.949
CONFLICT CLOSER TO BE YOU SEE

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:39.719
BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS BECAUSE

01:52:39.786 --> 01:52:41.354
THAT SYSTEM IS SO WELL DESIGNED.

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:42.021
THE P. YOU SEE IS GETTING ALL OF

01:52:42.088 --> 01:52:43.556
THE INFORMATION THAT THEY

01:52:43.623 --> 01:52:46.726
REQUEST PERIOD WITHOUT EXCEPTION.

01:52:46.793 --> 01:52:49.028
HAVING THE PRESUMPTION FLIP TO

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:50.530
EVERYTHING'S PUBLIC.

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:52.499
NOW PUT ALL YOUR INFORMATION AT

01:52:52.565 --> 01:52:53.800
RISK BECAUSE YOU ARE NEVER SHORT

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:55.135
TO BE YOU SEE WILL EVER REVIEW

01:52:55.201 --> 01:52:56.102
IT.

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:57.770
AND BLOCK EXPOSING.

01:52:57.837 --> 01:52:59.806
IMPORTANT PROPRIETARY FOR

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:01.174
NETWORK INFORMATION SO THAT YOU

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:01.875
WANT.

01:53:01.941 --> 01:53:03.510
THE SECOND PART OF SECTION FOUR

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:04.744
THAT WE OBJECT TO IS THERE'S A

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:07.080
FUNDAMENTAL FALSE PREMISE IN THE

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:07.780
BILL.

01:53:07.847 --> 01:53:08.581
AND THAT IS THAT THE

01:53:08.648 --> 01:53:10.950
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY.

01:53:11.017 --> 01:53:14.821
HAS CONTROL OVER ALL EMERGENCY

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:16.156
ALERT ECOSYSTEM.

01:53:16.222 --> 01:53:17.557
WE DO NOT AS THE SENATOR AS

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:18.958
HIGHLIGHTED WE HAVE THE WE A

01:53:19.025 --> 01:53:20.693
SYSTEM WHICH IS A BROADCAST

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.562
SYSTEM.

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:24.097
THAT SOFTWARE ITS LOCAL

01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:25.331
GOVERNMENT CONTROL ITS

01:53:25.398 --> 01:53:27.367
ENGAGEMENT WITH FEMA AND WHEN

01:53:27.433 --> 01:53:28.535
THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE

01:53:28.601 --> 01:53:30.336
BROADCAST A BROADCAST OVER THE

01:53:30.403 --> 01:53:31.538
WIRELESS NETWORK BUT IT'S NOT A

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:32.372
PHONE CALL.

01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:34.841
IT IS A BROADCAST EVERYONE IN A

01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:37.810
CELL SECTOR IDENTIFIED BY THE

01:53:37.877 --> 01:53:39.512
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:41.181
ACTUALLY WILL GT THE ALERT AND

01:53:41.247 --> 01:53:43.016
THE WAY YOU TEST WHETHER THE

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:44.817
ALERTS HAVE ARRIVED IS THE U.

01:53:44.884 --> 01:53:46.753
SURVEY MECHANISM AT FEMA AND

01:53:46.819 --> 01:53:47.987
SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:53:48.054 --> 01:53:49.155
HAVE DONE SO AS WELL.

01:53:49.222 --> 01:53:52.959
THEY FINE THAT WE END UP HITTING

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:54.460
UPWARDS OF 80%.

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:55.662
OF ALL THE CITIZENS WITH A

01:53:55.728 --> 01:53:57.330
WIRELESS DEVICE IN THAT AREA YOU

01:53:57.397 --> 01:53:59.065
MIGHT ASK WHAT ABOUT THE LAST

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:01.401
20% WILL USUALLY THAT'S BECAUSE

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:02.569
A PERSON HAS TURNED OFF THEIR

01:54:02.635 --> 01:54:03.670
PHONE WHERE THEY DISABLED THE

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:04.871
EMERGENCY ALERT OR THEY MAY

01:54:04.938 --> 01:54:05.939
ACTUALLY.

01:54:06.005 --> 01:54:07.307
NOT HAVE THE PHONE WITH THEM OR

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:08.641
MAY NOT EVEN RECALL THE GOT THE

01:54:08.708 --> 01:54:11.878
ALERT BECAUSE THEY'RE ESCAPING A

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:14.113
DANGEROUS SITUATION -- SO THE

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.082
WE'LL ALERT IS THE MOST

01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:17.083
COMPREHENSIVE AND ITS OPT OUT

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:19.519
AUTOMATICALLY ON YOUR PHONE

01:54:19.586 --> 01:54:20.920
RIGHT NOW.

01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:21.821
SO YOU HAVE TO OPT OUT OF THAT

01:54:21.888 --> 01:54:22.956
SYSTEM SO IT IS THE SUPERIOR

01:54:23.022 --> 01:54:23.489
SYSTEM.

01:54:23.556 --> 01:54:25.258
AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS INCREDIBLY

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:26.960
WELL BUT THE KEY HERE LOCAL

01:54:27.026 --> 01:54:28.328
GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY HAS TO ISSUE

01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:29.395
THE ALERT.

01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:30.964
AND THAT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE IN

01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.633
THE PAST -- QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.301
WERE RECENTLY ANSWERED IN A CAL

01:54:35.368 --> 01:54:37.870
ONLY A STUDY FROM LAST YEAR.

01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:39.305
AND IT AND I'LL QUOTE THE

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:40.707
TECHNICAL SYSTEMS FOR ALERT AND

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:42.041
WARNING DISSEMINATION APPEAR TO

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:43.776
A FUNCTION ADEQUATELY WE'RE

01:54:43.843 --> 01:54:44.611
TALKING ABOUT CINEMA IN THIS

01:54:44.677 --> 01:54:45.478
INSTANCE.

01:54:45.545 --> 01:54:47.413
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.715
SEVERE IMPACTS OF THE EVENT ON

01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:49.582
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:51.217
INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS CELLULAR

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:52.018
RADIO.

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:53.286
REPEATER SITES AND

01:54:53.353 --> 01:54:54.988
INTERCONNECTING FIBER CABLES THE

01:54:55.054 --> 01:54:56.723
POINT IS THE SYSTEMS WORKS AND

RECEIVE THEM BECAUSE THIS IS A

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:50.229
MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. TO BE

01:57:50.296 --> 01:57:52.532
ABLE TO LEAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:57:52.598 --> 01:57:54.233
ARE TO GET OUT OF HARM'S WAY TO

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:56.169
KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:59.806
AND I I WOULD HOPE THAT THE THE

01:57:59.872 --> 01:58:00.706
THE FELLOW FROM.

01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:04.477
THE CITY.

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:13.352
WHO IS HERE WITH THE STATE?

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:16.022
ALL RIGHT WELL -- OKAY SO OF OF

01:58:16.088 --> 01:58:18.691

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:20.893
BEEN DOING THIS KIND OF THING HE

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.361
THERE ARE SOME CITIES AND SOME.

01:58:22.428 --> 01:58:23.963
AREAS AND ARE DOING THIS BETTER

01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:25.865
THAN OTHERS AND ONE OF THE HOLES

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:27.266
IN ALL OF THIS THAT WE FOUND.

01:58:27.333 --> 01:58:28.968
HAS BEEN WITH THE WIRELESS

01:58:29.035 --> 01:58:31.204
COMMUNICATIONS MOST PEOPLE NOW

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:33.606
DON'T OPERATE USING LAND LINES

01:58:33.673 --> 01:58:35.541
SO THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW WE

01:58:35.608 --> 01:58:37.777
GONNA NOTIFY THEM AND ARE THESE

01:58:37.844 --> 01:58:39.879
NOTIFICATIONS AFFECTED.

01:58:39.946 --> 01:58:40.913
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:41.414
DO.

01:58:41.481 --> 01:58:43.249
I FIND IT KIND OF INTERESTING

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:44.183

WITH THE AUTHOR THIS BILL I

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:54.861

01:59:12.912 --> 01:59:13.713

01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:15.515
OF THE GOAL HERE IS TO TRY TO

01:59:15.581 --> 01:59:17.750
SAVE LIFE AND IT'S MY HOPE AND

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:19.952

ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS THAT'S

01:59:26.225 --> 01:59:27.326
WHY WE'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE

TEN BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE

01:59:35.268 --> 01:59:39.038
IS THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF

02:02:56.268 --> 02:02:57.703
SB FIVE FOURTEEN I REQUIRES THE

CPUC TO SEEK AUTHORIZATION FROM

02:03:00.473 --> 02:03:01.807
THE LEGISLATURE.

02:03:01.874 --> 02:03:04.176
PRIOR TO APPROVAL OF RATE

WHAT IS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS

02:03:32.404 --> 02:03:33.472

02:03:33.539 --> 02:03:35.007
THE LEGISLATURE HAS PLENARY

02:03:35.074 --> 02:03:36.776
POWER AFFORDED TO IT BY THE

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:39.745

02:03:52.558 --> 02:03:53.325
CHECK.

02:03:53.392 --> 02:03:54.760
ON THE CD USUALLY ENDED TWO IS A

SERVE OUR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:58.697
GRANTED BY THE CONSTITUTION

02:03:58.764 --> 02:04:00.266
AFTER THE ELECTRICITY CRISIS IN

02:04:00.332 --> 02:04:02.201
P. GENIES TWO THOUSAND AND ONE

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:02.902
BANKRUPT.

02:04:02.968 --> 02:04:04.703
THE CQC TOOK MEASURES TO IMPROVE

02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:07.006

LESS THAN ELEVEN POINT 22%.

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:18.250
UNTIL P. GENIES CREDIT RATING

02:04:18.317 --> 02:04:19.251

02:04:19.318 --> 02:04:20.085
YET EVEN ONCE P. GENIES CREDIT

02:04:20.152 --> 02:04:21.754
RATING IMPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:22.621
AND SEVENTEEN THREE DO YOU SEE

02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:23.389
ANOTHER FIVE YEARS.

02:04:23.455 --> 02:04:25.024
BEFORE THEY ADJUSTED THE RATE OF

02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:27.259
RETURN BACK DOWN TO WHAT IT WAS

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:28.627
PREVIOUSLY.

02:04:28.694 --> 02:04:29.795
NOW I'M I HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:31.230
IN THE CPUC TODAY.

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:32.431
I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME OF THE

02:04:32.498 --> 02:04:33.699
BEST COMMISSIONERS IN THE

02:04:33.766 --> 02:04:35.100
HISTORY OF THE CPUC PUBLIC

02:04:35.167 --> 02:04:36.802
SERVANTS WHO ARE THOUGHTFUL AND

02:04:36.869 --> 02:04:38.704
CARING AND BALANCE SAFETY AND

02:04:38.771 --> 02:04:40.306
AFFORDABILITY AND RELIABILITY.

02:04:40.372 --> 02:04:41.740
OF ENERGY SERVICE.

02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:44.143
BUT WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE

02:04:44.210 --> 02:04:45.044
OVERSIGHT.

02:04:45.110 --> 02:04:45.878
BUT EVERY DAY WHEN EVERYONE'S

02:04:45.945 --> 02:04:47.346
GOALS ARE IN HARMONY THIS

02:04:47.413 --> 02:04:49.048
OVERSIGHT FUNCTION IS

02:04:49.114 --> 02:04:50.516
UNDERSTANDABLY MINIMAL.

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:52.051
BUT WE SHOULD NOT SEE THE R.

02:04:52.117 --> 02:04:53.419
OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY.

02:04:53.485 --> 02:04:54.787
NOW IN THE HOPE THAT THIS

02:04:54.854 --> 02:04:56.922
HARMONY REMAINS I UNDERSTAND

02:04:56.989 --> 02:04:58.224
THAT THE CONSEQUENCES SEE MORE

02:04:58.290 --> 02:05:00.392
HEIGHTENED BECAUSE P. GENIE IS

02:05:00.459 --> 02:05:01.460
IN THE MIDST OF BANKRUPTCY.

02:05:01.527 --> 02:05:03.162
COLLEAGUES THAT IS THE VERY

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:05.231
REASON WE SHOULD BE INVOLVED.

NONE OF US WANT PEACE YOU NEED

ON CHANGE WE WANT A SAFER MORE

02:05:09.869 --> 02:05:12.671

ELEVEN BY MAKING ATTACHING

02:07:04.717 --> 02:07:06.385
CONDITIONS TO THE EXTENSION OF

02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:07.686

THESE LOANS OFTEN COME WITH

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:12.591
CONDITIONS THAT SAY FOR EXAMPLE --

02:07:21.166 --> 02:07:23.302
OUTCOME THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY

02:07:23.369 --> 02:07:24.203
WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING BUT THE

02:07:24.269 --> 02:07:25.704
FACT THAT THE BANK HAS ACQUIRED

02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:27.473
THAT RIGHT ON THEN SHAPES THE

02:07:27.539 --> 02:07:28.874
BARGAIN THAT DOESN'T MERGING THE

PLAYBOOK AND I'M CONDITIONS THE

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:45.991
EXTENSION OF FINANCING TO

GIVE UP MORE THAN THEY WOULD

02:09:05.904 --> 02:09:07.406
HAVE OTHERWISE INCLUDING THE

WEAKENING PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS --

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:23.822
HOW IS THIS BILL DIFFERENCE FROM

02:09:23.889 --> 02:09:24.323
THESE PRIOR GOVERNMENTAL

02:09:24.389 --> 02:09:26.258
INTERVENTIONS THE FIRST IS

02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:27.993
UNLIKE GM OR OTHER PROMINENT

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:30.329
BANKRUPTCY CASES THIS ISN'T

02:09:30.395 --> 02:09:31.363
DISCUSSING ACQUIRING INFLUENCE

02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:32.331
OVER THE BEGINNING OF THE

02:09:32.397 --> 02:09:33.866
BANKRUPTCY CASE THE PROVISION OF

02:09:33.932 --> 02:09:34.333
FINANCING?

02:09:34.399 --> 02:09:36.068
P. JEANNIE WAS ABLE TO GET MONEY

02:09:36.135 --> 02:09:37.936
FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THEY

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:39.605
DON'T NEED MONEY FROM YOU TO

02:09:39.671 --> 02:09:41.140
ALLOW THEM TO BE IN BANKRUPTCY

02:09:41.206 --> 02:09:42.841

02:09:42.908 --> 02:09:44.510
NEED TAX PAYER RATE PAYER MONEY

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:45.177
LATER.

02:09:45.244 --> 02:09:45.811
WHICH MEANS THAT THE

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:47.412
GOVERNMENT'S CASH INFUSION WILL

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:49.214
COME LATER IN TIME LEADER IN

02:09:49.281 --> 02:09:50.315
TIME SOMETIMES MEANS THAT YOUR

02:09:50.382 --> 02:09:51.917
BARGAINING POWER ENDS UP BEING

02:09:51.984 --> 02:09:53.018
MORE LIMITED THAN IT WOULD HAVE

02:09:53.085 --> 02:09:55.254
BEEN HAD YOU SORT OF SHAPE THE

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:56.255
COURSE OF CONDUCT FROM THE

02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:57.689
BEGINNING -- IT SO HERE WE ARE

02:09:57.756 --> 02:10:02.361
TRYING TO USE THE BACK END OF

02:10:02.427 --> 02:10:04.263
THE CASE IN STATING RIGHT NOW

02:10:04.329 --> 02:10:05.631
HOW THE TO THE EXTENT YOU WANTS

02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:06.899
TO RAISE RATES -- OR GET A

02:10:06.965 --> 02:10:07.566
CAPITAL STRUCTURE JUST MEANT I'M

02:10:07.633 --> 02:10:08.133
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO THE

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:08.700
CONSENT IN SUPPORT OF THE

02:10:08.767 --> 02:10:11.103
LEGISLATURE -- IN SACRAMENTO BY

02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:12.538
STANDING BETWEEN P. JEANNIE AND

02:10:12.604 --> 02:10:14.173
THE EXIT FROM BANKRUPTCY YOU CAN

02:10:14.239 --> 02:10:15.674
TELL TO THE PLAYING FIELD IN

02:10:15.741 --> 02:10:16.708
FAVOR OF THE INTEREST YOU CARE

02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:18.911
ABOUT WHETHER IS PUBLIC SAFETY A

02:10:18.977 --> 02:10:20.479
REPAIRS OR ANYTHING ELSE.

02:10:20.546 --> 02:10:21.813
TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS ARE NOT

02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:23.182
REPRESENTED AT THE BANKRUPTCY

02:10:23.248 --> 02:10:25.083
BARGAINING TABLE DIRECTLY --

02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:26.718
THIS BILL WILL CAST A SHADOW

02:10:26.785 --> 02:10:28.053
OVER THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:29.521
THAT WILL CHANGE THE RELATIVE

02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:30.355
BARGAINING POWER OF DIFFERENT

02:10:30.422 --> 02:10:32.157
PARTIES AND RESHAPE THE

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:33.458
BANKRUPTCY BARGAINING TERRAIN --

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:34.993
IMPORTANTLY I BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:36.195
BILL WILL START TO CAST THAT

02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:38.096
HADOWS TODAY HOPEFULLY WHEN

02:10:38.163 --> 02:10:39.298
THIS BILLS PASSED OUT OF

02:10:39.364 --> 02:10:40.399
COMMITTEE AND THE PARTIES WERE

02:10:40.465 --> 02:10:41.867
NEGOTIATING REALIZED.

02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:43.168
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:44.169
OUT THERE IN THE FUTURE THAT

02:10:44.236 --> 02:10:45.604
THEY NEED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF AND

02:10:45.671 --> 02:10:47.039
COMING TO AGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT

02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:48.207
SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE BANKRUPTCY

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:49.641
CASE AND WHO IS GOING TO MAKE

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:50.876
WHAT SACRIFICES.

02:10:50.943 --> 02:10:52.444
I'M CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:54.146
LEADER ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND

02:10:54.213 --> 02:10:55.314
USING STATE LAW IN A WAY THAT IS

02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:56.448
CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:58.150
BANKRUPTCY LAW. TO RESHAPE

02:10:58.217 --> 02:10:59.284
BANKRUPTCY OUTCOMES USING

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:01.420
EXPECTED BACK AND CONTRIBUTION

02:11:01.486 --> 02:11:02.588
IT'S JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF

02:11:02.654 --> 02:11:03.689
CALIFORNIA INNOVATING AND

02:11:03.755 --> 02:11:05.424
CREATING A PRECEDENT THAT OTHER

02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:06.525
STATES CAN FOLLOW WHEN THEIR OWN

02:11:06.592 --> 02:11:08.327
UTILITIES GRAPPLE WITH CLIMATE

02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:09.895
CHANGE -- I WORRY ABOUT TWO

02:11:09.962 --> 02:11:13.999
SITUATIONS IN PARTICULAR -- THE

02:11:14.066 --> 02:11:15.334
THE BARGAINING TABLE DIRECTLY SO

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.535
IT'LL BE VERY EASY FOR ALL THE

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:17.869
PARTIES WERE AT THE BARGAINING

02:11:17.936 --> 02:11:19.238
TABLE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN OF

02:11:19.304 --> 02:11:20.939
ORGANIZATION THE CONTEMPLATES A

02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:23.475
LARGE CONTRIBUTION EITHER IN THE

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:25.143
FORM OF LIABILITY RELIEF -- A

02:11:25.210 --> 02:11:26.712
CHANGE LIABILITY ENVIRONMENT FOR

02:11:26.778 --> 02:11:29.181
A RATE INCREASE -- AND THAT MAY

02:11:29.248 --> 02:11:31.583
COME TO BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE A

02:11:31.650 --> 02:11:32.851
YEAR FROM NOW WHEN P. GENIE HAS

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:34.486
ALREADY ABSORBED MORE THAN FIVE

02:11:34.553 --> 02:11:35.854
HUNDRED OR SO MILLION DOLLARS ON

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:37.489
LITIGATION EXPENSES WHEN WILD

02:11:37.556 --> 02:11:38.790
FIRE VICTIMS WERE ALREADY

02:11:38.857 --> 02:11:40.926
WAITING TO GET PAID -- ARE EAGER

02:11:40.993 --> 02:11:43.195
TO GET SOMETHING -- INTO NEW MAY

02:11:43.262 --> 02:11:44.463
FACE A SITUATION WHERE THE

02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:46.198
BANKRUPTCY JUDGE SUPPORTS THE

02:11:46.265 --> 02:11:48.133
DEAL -- IN THE THE PARTIES

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.134
INCLUDING P. GENIE IN THE

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:50.369
BANKRUPTCY CASE MAY TRY TO USE

02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:52.070
BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE TO MAKE IT

02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:53.405
HARDER FOR YOU TO ASK FOR A

02:11:53.472 --> 02:11:54.473
DIFFERENT DEAL OR TO ASK TO

02:11:54.539 --> 02:11:55.807
RENEGOTIATE.

02:11:55.874 --> 02:11:57.643
WHAT IS GOING ON SO THE

02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:58.844
RATIONALE BEHIND THIS BILL IS

02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:00.145
THAT BY PASSING THIS BILL YOU'LL

02:12:00.212 --> 02:12:01.680
SIT IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:02.581
MEETINGS THAT ARE ALREADY GOING

02:12:02.648 --> 02:12:04.750
ON AND PARTY'S WILL UNDERSTAND

02:12:04.816 --> 02:12:05.917
THAT I. P. GENIES I COULD

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:07.386

02:12:07.452 --> 02:12:09.288
RUNS THROUGH THIS BUILDING --

02:12:09.354 --> 02:12:11.089
AND THE SECOND REASON WHAT THE

02:12:11.156 --> 02:12:12.491
SECOND THING THAT I WORRY ABOUT

02:12:12.557 --> 02:12:13.525
IS THAT THE CQC IS ALREADY

02:12:13.592 --> 02:12:14.593
ACCORDING TO THE SAN FRANCISCO

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.728

SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES PURSUANT TO

ASKING I'M NINE A ONE ONE COULD

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:28.307
EASILY IMAGINE A BANKRUPTCY PLAN

02:12:28.373 --> 02:12:29.708
THAT WOULD SATISFY BANKRUPTCY

02:12:29.775 --> 02:12:29.908
LAW.

02:12:29.975 --> 02:12:31.243
THAT'LL PAY WHILE FOR VICTIMS

02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:33.011
PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR I'M ON THE

02:12:33.078 --> 02:12:34.546

ALL OF ITS EXISTING ASSET BASE

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:41.887
I'M TO SELF INSURE AGAINST

FUTURE WILDFIRES.

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:43.889
PLAN WOULD BE LEGAL -- IN

02:12:43.955 --> 02:12:44.956

PRESENTATION OF BANKRUPTCY AND

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:30.695
THAT IS THE WAY.

ALREADY PROVIDING [inaudible]

02:14:43.375 --> 02:14:45.744
THE EXPERTISE.

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:47.179

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:06.398
RISK REDUNDANCY.

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:07.999
THAT IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE

02:15:08.066 --> 02:15:09.501
IT'S ALREADY BUILT INTO THE

02:15:09.568 --> 02:15:14.806
PROCESS -- NONE THE LESS --

02:15:14.873 --> 02:15:16.608
AGAIN THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL

02:15:16.675 --> 02:15:19.978
CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK IT DESERVES.

02:15:20.045 --> 02:15:21.947
A CONVERT TO A YOU KNOW A

02:15:22.013 --> 02:15:24.850
CONVERSATION IT DESERVES -- A

02:15:24.916 --> 02:15:26.384
DEBATE A DIP.

02:15:26.451 --> 02:15:29.788
AND NEW AND INTERESTING AND

02:15:29.855 --> 02:15:31.490
IDEAS NEED TO BE.

02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:33.325
AARON REVIEWED THIS ISN'T A NEW

02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:37.062
AN INTERESTING IDEA -- TO OUR

02:15:37.128 --> 02:15:39.431
DELIGHT OF THE LEGISLATURE DEALS

02:15:39.498 --> 02:15:40.932
WITH EVERYTHING.

02:15:40.999 --> 02:15:42.634
WITH EVERY ISSUE.

02:15:42.701 --> 02:15:44.302
AND WE'RE BOMBARDED WITH EVERY

02:15:44.369 --> 02:15:46.404
ISSUE AND AND IT'S HARD TO

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:49.040
BECOME A TECHNICAL EXPERT ON

02:15:49.107 --> 02:15:51.276
EVERY ISSUE IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE.

02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:53.144
AND I AND THEN WHEN YOU AND

02:15:53.211 --> 02:15:55.113
CALIFORNIANS REPEATEDLY HAVE

02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:56.715
VOTED.

02:15:56.781 --> 02:15:59.751
FOR CITIZENS LEGISLATURE ANYTIME.

02:15:59.818 --> 02:16:01.286
CALIFORNIANS CONVERT FOR TERM

02:16:01.353 --> 02:16:04.122
LIMITS THERE FOR THAT.

02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:05.657
THEY DON'T WANT CAREER

02:16:05.724 --> 02:16:08.126
POLITICIANS THEY WANT.

02:16:08.193 --> 02:16:09.327
THEY WANT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN

02:16:09.394 --> 02:16:10.962
RATE OF COMMAND.

02:16:11.029 --> 02:16:14.866
AND AND TO MAKE DECISIONS.

02:16:14.933 --> 02:16:15.967
AND WHAT IS BAD BEST FOR THEIR

02:16:16.034 --> 02:16:17.569
BEHALF SO.

02:16:17.636 --> 02:16:19.471
IT'S HARD TO GET.

02:16:19.538 --> 02:16:21.806
IT IS HARD TO GET OF EXPERTS IN

02:16:21.873 --> 02:16:23.542
ANY ONE ISSUE AND IF WE DID

02:16:23.608 --> 02:16:25.443
THEY'D BE AN EXPERT IN ONE ISSUE

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.045
AND NOT AN EXPERT IN.

02:16:27.112 --> 02:16:28.346
AND LOTS OF ISSUES AND THAT'S

02:16:28.413 --> 02:16:31.182
WHY THE THE FOR ME THIS BILL.

02:16:31.249 --> 02:16:33.184
IT IS REALLY HARD HARD THING FOR

02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:34.719
ME TO CONTEMPLATE.

02:16:34.786 --> 02:16:36.588
AS AS THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION

02:16:36.655 --> 02:16:41.760

I BELIEVE.

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:10.622
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE A

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:14.059

THERE ARE CERTAIN FEDERAL

02:29:43.274 --> 02:29:45.576
SANDERS HAVING TO DEAL WITH --

02:29:45.643 --> 02:29:47.511
VEHICLE DESIGN.

A OF A CABIN.

02:30:07.398 --> 02:30:09.667
WHAT WHAT ARE WORTH WHAT ARE THE

02:30:09.734 --> 02:30:11.268
DANGERS ASSOCIATED THAT WITH

COMBUSTIBLE NORMALLY IN VEHICLES

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:23.381
THAT'S NOT ALLOWED.

02:30:23.447 --> 02:30:24.849
THEY HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC

02:30:24.915 --> 02:30:26.417
LIGHTER VEHICLES.

02:30:26.484 --> 02:30:28.619
THAT DOES NOT PRODUCE A SPARK OR

02:30:28.686 --> 02:30:30.521
FIRE.

02:30:30.588 --> 02:30:31.756
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A VERY

02:30:31.822 --> 02:30:33.891
CROWDED BUS IN THE BACK WHERE

02:30:33.958 --> 02:30:35.659

COMBUSTIBLES INTO.

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:52.676
A CABIN OF A OF A OF A VEHICLE

02:30:52.743 --> 02:30:54.612
THAT IS POWERED BY A COMBUSTIBLE

02:30:54.678 --> 02:30:56.714
FUEL.

02:30:56.781 --> 02:30:59.283
YEAH IN IN AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE

02:30:59.350 --> 02:31:01.018

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:03.154
CONDITION WHERE THERE MAY BE

02:31:03.220 --> 02:31:04.722
LESS RESPONSIVE.

02:31:04.789 --> 02:31:06.824
AN EMERGENCY.

02:31:06.891 --> 02:31:08.159
HI SO THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE THE

02:31:08.225 --> 02:31:09.994
SECOND ISSUES HAVING TO DEAL

02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:12.263
WITH -- HOW YOU SEPARATE THE

02:31:12.329 --> 02:31:13.864

THAT IS IS IS SAFE FOR THE

02:31:20.571 --> 02:31:23.240
DRIVER.

02:31:23.307 --> 02:31:27.945
AND ALSO -- AND I'M I'M LOOKING

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:34.485
AT THAT -- CREATES A DRIVER

02:31:34.552 --> 02:31:35.619
COMPARTMENT WHERE THE DRIVERS

02:31:35.686 --> 02:31:39.323
COMPLETELY SEALED OFF.

02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:42.760
WHO IS THE ONLY -- NORMALLY

02:31:42.827 --> 02:31:44.228
DRIVERS ARE ARE.

02:31:44.295 --> 02:31:45.663
NOT ONLY THE DRIVERS OF THE

02:31:45.729 --> 02:31:47.264
VEHICLE BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE

02:31:47.331 --> 02:31:49.633
SUPERVISORS OF THE ACTIVITY

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.602
BEHIND THE VEHICLE.

02:31:51.669 --> 02:31:53.838
IN IF I COULD POINT OUT MISTER

02:31:53.904 --> 02:31:55.139

02:31:57.741 --> 02:31:59.143
TRANSPARENT AND IT IS A DOOR.

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:01.045
SO JUST CLOSE THAT IF THERE'S AN

02:32:01.111 --> 02:32:04.882
EMERGENCY THE EASIEST WAY TO GET

02:32:04.949 --> 02:32:06.817
BACK IN.

02:32:06.884 --> 02:32:08.853
I WAS UNDER THE REAR OF THE

02:32:08.919 --> 02:32:09.553
THING I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE BY.

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:13.090
I SEE THAT BUT I ALSO SEE.

02:32:13.157 --> 02:32:18.329
THAT -- IN THIS PHOTO HERE.

02:32:18.395 --> 02:32:21.499
IN THIS PHOTO HERE THE VIEW.

02:32:21.565 --> 02:32:24.301

02:32:24.368 --> 02:32:25.369
OF THE DRIVER IS COMPLETELY

02:32:25.436 --> 02:32:27.404
BLACK BOX OFFICE HIS VIEW IS

02:32:27.471 --> 02:32:28.739
SIDE WAYS.

02:32:28.806 --> 02:32:30.007
WHERE WHERE IS THE VIEW INTO THE

02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:33.277
CABIN?

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:34.378
I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE HE LOOKS

02:32:34.445 --> 02:32:35.412
AROUND THE ACHING DID WHATEVER

02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:37.281
THAT DOOR IS THAT SEPARATES THE

02:32:37.348 --> 02:32:38.549
TWO OF AND WE CAN GET YOU MORE

02:32:38.616 --> 02:32:41.252
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSTRUCTION AND

02:32:41.318 --> 02:32:42.720
I'VE I'VE BEEN IN THE BUSES

02:32:42.786 --> 02:32:43.220
WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:32:43.287 --> 02:32:44.288
OBSTRUCTION.

02:32:44.355 --> 02:32:46.557
WITHOUT HAVING IT WASN'T A

02:32:46.624 --> 02:32:48.259
MARIJUANA TOWARD BY THE WAY --

02:32:48.325 --> 02:32:49.527

YOU CAN'T TO SEE BUT BUT I THINK

02:32:52.796 --> 02:32:54.131
THAT YOU'RE MAKING A VERY VALID

02:32:54.198 --> 02:32:58.602
I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A BUS THAT

02:32:58.669 --> 02:33:00.004
HAS AN OBSTRUCTION.

02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:01.272
IF THE BEHIND THE DRIVER'S SEAT

02:33:01.338 --> 02:33:02.606
I'VE SEEN THAT ALL THE WAY TO

02:33:02.673 --> 02:33:02.840
THE TOP.

02:33:02.907 --> 02:33:06.710
OF I'VE SEEN THAT AND SO IT IT'S

02:33:06.777 --> 02:33:08.612
IT'S VERY BUT I I THINK YOU MAKE

02:33:08.679 --> 02:33:09.980
A GOOD A POINTS.

02:33:10.047 --> 02:33:11.549
THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:33:11.615 --> 02:33:14.718
THERE'S EASY ACCESS.

02:33:14.785 --> 02:33:18.422
WHITE AND YOUR YOUR STAFF BOARD.

WORK CLOSELY WITH US AND I DID

02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:20.758
AND I DID WANT TO CUT YOU OFF ON

02:33:20.824 --> 02:33:21.692
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE NO NO

02:33:21.759 --> 02:33:22.860
THAT'S FINE AND IT'S OKAY IF WE

02:33:22.927 --> 02:33:24.528
HAVE AN EXCHANGE HERE BECAUSE I

02:33:24.595 --> 02:33:27.231
I HONESTLY I WE HAVE HAD LATELY

02:33:27.298 --> 02:33:29.300
DISCUSSION MY STUFF AS WELL ON

02:33:29.366 --> 02:33:30.167
THIS AS WELL.

02:33:30.234 --> 02:33:32.269
BECAUSE YOU CAN THAT YOU KNOW

02:33:32.336 --> 02:33:32.803
SHE MENTIONED YOU'VE BEEN

02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:34.238
WORKING WITH THE THE HIGHWAY

02:33:34.305 --> 02:33:36.006
PATROL THERE AND AT SOME LEVEL

02:33:36.073 --> 02:33:38.642
THERE'S GONNA BE SOME LEVEL OF

02:33:38.709 --> 02:33:41.312
HIGHWAY PATROL'S.

02:33:41.378 --> 02:33:44.548
APPROVAL BUT AS LONG AS THERE IS

02:33:44.615 --> 02:33:47.318
A THERE ARE SOME STANDARDS OF

02:33:47.384 --> 02:33:48.819
THE HIGHWAY PATROL CAN ACTUALLY

02:33:48.886 --> 02:33:49.119
[inaudible]

02:33:49.186 --> 02:33:55.392
OF REFERENCE WHICH FROM MY

02:33:55.459 --> 02:33:57.061
UNDERSTANDING THERE AREN'T

02:33:57.127 --> 02:33:58.162
CURRENTLY.

02:33:58.228 --> 02:33:59.930
ANY STANDARDS THAT THEY CAN

02:33:59.997 --> 02:34:01.565
REFERENCE.

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:04.835
AND IF THERE ARE AND I'D LIKE --

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:06.971
TO GIVE THROUGH THIS BILL THE

02:34:07.037 --> 02:34:08.973
HIGHWAY PATROL THE ABILITY TO

02:34:09.039 --> 02:34:10.674
THE LEAST ESTABLISH THOSE

02:34:10.741 --> 02:34:12.476
STANDARDS.

02:34:12.543 --> 02:34:13.644
I THINK THAT'S FAIR I THINK THIS

02:34:13.711 --> 02:34:15.079
THE HIGHWAY PATROL SHOULD

02:34:15.145 --> 02:34:16.714
DEVELOP WHATEVER STANDARDS THEY

02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:18.849
NEED TO DO DE TO DEVELOP AND

02:34:18.916 --> 02:34:20.217
OBSERVE.

02:34:20.284 --> 02:34:22.386
AND ENFORCED WHEN THEY APPROVED

02:34:22.453 --> 02:34:24.655
THE PARTICULAR DESIGN FOR ACCESS

02:34:24.722 --> 02:34:25.889
AND FOR SAFETY AND ALL OF THE

02:34:25.956 --> 02:34:26.690
OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT

02:34:26.757 --> 02:34:28.525
WE'RE WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM

02:34:28.592 --> 02:34:29.893
ALSO ONE ON THE IDEA THAT.

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:31.295
YOU KNOW THE CONSUMPTION OF THE

02:34:31.362 --> 02:34:33.564
PRODUCT IN THE VEHICLE REALLY

02:34:33.631 --> 02:34:35.699
CAN'T BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE TO BE

02:34:35.766 --> 02:34:36.400
SHOWN YEAH.

02:34:36.467 --> 02:34:37.968
BERNIE PUBLIC PLACE AND AND THAT

02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:39.536
THEY'RE PREPARED NOTICES INSIDE

02:34:39.603 --> 02:34:40.938
THE VEHICLE LETTING PEOPLE KNOW

02:34:41.005 --> 02:34:43.907
WHAT THE LIMITATIONS ARE AND

02:34:43.974 --> 02:34:44.475
WHAT WE WITH THIS MOTION SO

02:34:44.541 --> 02:34:44.708
THERE.

02:34:44.775 --> 02:34:49.880
THIS IS I THINK THIS WOULD BE A

02:34:49.947 --> 02:34:50.881
VERY APPROPRIATE.

02:34:50.948 --> 02:34:51.782
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE HIGHWAY

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:52.750
PATROL THE WAY AND IF THEY ARE

02:34:52.816 --> 02:34:53.550
GOING TO BE USING LIGHTERS THAT

02:34:53.617 --> 02:34:54.652
THEY BE LIGHTERS THAT ARE

02:34:54.718 --> 02:34:56.086
APPROPRIATE FOR VEHICLE USE TO

02:34:56.153 --> 02:34:57.187
EIGHT BUT I THINK THAT'S TRUE I

02:34:57.254 --> 02:34:58.022
DON'T KNOW.

02:34:58.088 --> 02:35:02.826
HOW IT WORKS TODAY WHEN YOU HAVE --

02:35:02.893 --> 02:35:03.794
YOU KNOW PARTY BUS IN PEOPLE ARE.

02:35:03.861 --> 02:35:05.095
DRINKING ON THERE AND SOMEBODY

02:35:05.162 --> 02:35:06.630
IN THE BACK WANTS TO SMOKE THERE

IGNORE A REQUIRED EXPENSE JUST

02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:05.235
BECAUSE SOME OTHER SET OF

WHY THESE CASES TAKE SO LONG?

02:48:03.206 --> 02:48:06.075

02:48:12.715 --> 02:48:14.217
SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANIES

02:48:15.718 --> 02:48:17.187
OF SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT'S

02:48:17.253 --> 02:48:18.888
ALL THEY HAVE.

02:48:18.955 --> 02:48:21.257
AND AND DIG IT'S ALREADY HARD

02:48:21.324 --> 02:48:24.127
ENOUGH O KEEP THE TELEPHONE

02:48:24.194 --> 02:48:27.530
COMPANIES IN BUSINESS OUT THERE --

02:48:27.597 --> 02:48:29.332
AND AND PUTTING A RICH -- ON A

02:48:29.399 --> 02:48:30.800
REGULATORY AN ADDITIONAL

02:48:30.867 --> 02:48:32.168
REGULATORY BURDEN ON THEM WOULD

02:48:32.235 --> 02:48:34.938
JUST MAKE IT MUCH DIFFICULT FOR

02:48:35.004 --> 02:48:36.406
THEM TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND I I

02:48:36.473 --> 02:48:38.174
GUESS MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

02:48:38.241 --> 02:48:39.542
GIVING PEOPLE.

02:48:39.609 --> 02:48:41.110
THE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION

02:48:41.177 --> 02:48:44.047
SO. ONE WHEN I WHEN I LEARNED

THIS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:52.989
NEED TO FIX.

BE THERE BUT I THE LOOK LIKE MY

02:49:00.597 --> 02:49:01.464
QUESTION IS WHAT WAT IS IT

02:49:01.531 --> 02:49:03.366
TAKES SO LONG WHY TO TAKE THREE

02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:07.237
YEARS. TO RENDER A DECISION.

02:49:07.303 --> 02:49:08.438

02:49:25.455 --> 02:49:26.589
BIT I MEAN IF YOU YOURSELF --

02:49:26.656 --> 02:49:27.457
BETTER GOSPEL -- I'M THE

02:49:27.524 --> 02:49:29.692
REGULATORY ATTORNEY FOR A LOT OF

02:49:29.759 --> 02:49:30.260
THESE COMPANIES BEFORE THE

02:49:30.326 --> 02:49:31.694
COMMISSION AND PARTICIPATED IN A

02:49:31.761 --> 02:49:33.229
LOT OF THE RATE CASES.

02:49:33.296 --> 02:49:34.430
INCLUDING GOING BACK TO WHEN

02:49:34.497 --> 02:49:35.465
THEY USED TO BE HANDLED MORE

02:49:35.532 --> 02:49:36.900
EFFICIENTLY THROUGH THE ADVICE

02:49:36.966 --> 02:49:39.636
LETTER PROCESS. TO YOUR QUESTION

02:49:39.702 --> 02:49:40.336
I THINK.

02:49:40.403 --> 02:49:42.038
A LOT OF STATES DO THESE KINDS

02:49:42.105 --> 02:49:44.407
OF CASES IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS --

02:49:44.474 --> 02:49:46.676
AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU

02:49:46.743 --> 02:49:47.911
KNOW THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:50.146
TIME TO TO HANDLE RUNNING SMALL

02:49:50.213 --> 02:49:53.716
TELEPHONE COMPANY WOULD TAKE SIX

02:49:53.783 --> 02:49:55.084
MONTHS.

02:49:55.151 --> 02:49:55.752
SOME STATES HAVE DIFFERENT

02:49:55.818 --> 02:49:58.254
LAYERS OF OF PROCESS USE AND SO

02:49:58.321 --> 02:49:59.422
IF IT FITS WITHIN CERTAIN

02:49:59.489 --> 02:50:01.558
PARAMETERS IT CAN BE EVEN FASTER

02:50:01.624 --> 02:50:03.226
THAN THAT -- BUT SO I THINK

02:50:03.293 --> 02:50:04.260
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THEY

02:50:04.327 --> 02:50:05.795
COULD BE EVEN FASTER BUT TO

02:50:05.862 --> 02:50:08.031
CONDUCT THE THE FULL REVIEW OF

02:50:08.097 --> 02:50:09.999
OF THE REVENUES OF THE OF THE

02:50:10.066 --> 02:50:11.568
INVESTMENTS AND ALL THE THINGS

02:50:11.634 --> 02:50:12.635
GOING TO RAPE CASE.

02:50:12.702 --> 02:50:13.970
MOST STATES ARE DOING IT IN

02:50:14.037 --> 02:50:15.471
SOMETHING LIKE SIX MONTHS.

02:50:15.538 --> 02:50:17.206
SO THIS TIMING THAT WE'RE ASKING

02:50:17.273 --> 02:50:18.575
FOR BUILDING QUITE A BIT MORE

02:50:18.641 --> 02:50:20.376
TIME -- AND SO IS VERY

02:50:20.443 --> 02:50:22.178
CONSERVATIVE IN ITS APPROACH I

02:50:22.245 --> 02:50:23.246
WOULD SAY.

02:50:23.313 --> 02:50:24.681
IF THAT ANSWERS MENTIONED DURING

02:50:24.747 --> 02:50:27.584
THIS PROCESS THIS STILL ALLOWS

02:50:27.650 --> 02:50:29.586
YOU TO SUBMIT WHAT.

02:50:29.652 --> 02:50:31.187
WHAT -- RATE CHANGES YOU'RE

02:50:31.254 --> 02:50:31.788
SEEKING.

02:50:31.854 --> 02:50:33.356
YEAH THE THE ACTUAL CALCULATIONS

02:50:33.423 --> 02:50:35.325
AND DATA SUPPORTING A PROPOSAL

02:50:35.391 --> 02:50:36.659
IN A RAPE CASE WHETHER IT'S

02:50:36.726 --> 02:50:38.328
SUBMITTED BY BY SLOWER BY

02:50:38.394 --> 02:50:39.862
APPLICATION IT'S THE SAME.

02:50:39.929 --> 02:50:41.230
AND AND SO.

02:50:41.297 --> 02:50:43.800
THE THE COMMISSION HAS ACCESS TO

02:50:43.866 --> 02:50:45.401
THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL.

02:50:45.468 --> 02:50:46.703
WHETHER THEY DO IT WITH THE NAIL

02:50:46.769 --> 02:50:48.838
JAY OR WHETHER THEY HAVE THE

02:50:48.905 --> 02:50:50.540
COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION REVIEW

02:50:50.607 --> 02:50:52.308
THAT THE DOCUMENTS.

02:50:52.375 --> 02:50:53.776
THAT ARTS BURKE.

02:50:53.843 --> 02:50:55.244
I'M SORRY BUT I CAN'T HEAR A

02:50:55.311 --> 02:50:58.982
THING OVER HERE.

02:50:59.048 --> 02:51:03.186
THE TRICK OF THE EYE BETTER.

02:51:03.252 --> 02:51:05.788
AND IF I MAY I I WOULD OUT W.

02:51:05.855 --> 02:51:10.827
RIGHT TO ASK ANYWAY GO AHEAD.

THE CAL PA IS THE ONLY ENTITY

02:51:14.731 --> 02:51:15.865

COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION DOES IT.

02:51:20.203 --> 02:51:21.371
AND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT WHEN

02:51:21.437 --> 02:51:23.539
THAT OCCURS IT TURNS INTO MORE

02:51:23.606 --> 02:51:25.408
OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE NUMERICAL

02:51:25.475 --> 02:51:26.809
EXERCISE WHERE THE DATA IS

02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:28.211
REVIEWED AND REASONABLE

02:51:28.277 --> 02:51:29.412
DECISIONS ARE REACHED.

02:51:29.479 --> 02:51:31.080
WHAT HAPPENS IN AN APPLICATION

02:51:31.147 --> 02:51:32.415
PROCESS IS IT BECOMES MORE

02:51:32.482 --> 02:51:35.151
ADVERSARIAL JUST BY THE NATURE

02:51:35.218 --> 02:51:36.252
OF THE PROCESS?

02:51:36.319 --> 02:51:37.987
BUT THE OFFICE REPAIR ADVOCATES

02:51:38.054 --> 02:51:39.722
STILL INVOLVED.

02:51:39.789 --> 02:51:40.723
CERTAINLY AND THERE ARE LOTS OF

02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:42.592
ADVICE LETTER CONTEXT IN WHICH

THEY CAN SUBMIT A PROTEST -- AND

02:51:44.927 --> 02:51:46.429

INFORMAL PROCESS THEY COULD

02:51:47.430 --> 02:51:48.898
SUBMIT THEIR VIEWS IN ANY WAY

02:51:48.965 --> 02:51:51.134
THEY SEE FIT -- AND THEN

02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:52.301
MEDICATIONS DIVISION WOULD

02:51:52.368 --> 02:51:53.436
CONSIDER THAT.

02:51:53.503 --> 02:51:55.204
IT WOULD ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A

02:51:55.271 --> 02:51:56.906

03:06:32.014 --> 03:06:33.315
ONE AMENDMENT WE WOULD LIKE TO

03:06:33.382 --> 03:06:35.317

03:06:35.384 --> 03:06:36.585
COMMISSION ACTUALLY CREATES AND

03:06:36.652 --> 03:06:38.086

CCA THAT'S 40% OF OUR LOAD.

03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:53.335

THAT WE HAVE 15% OF OUR LOAD

I THINK WE JUST WANT TO POINT

03:07:31.974 --> 03:07:33.041
OUT WHAT WE THINK IS MISSING

03:07:33.108 --> 03:07:35.010
FROM THE BILL AS IT CURRENTLY

03:07:35.077 --> 03:07:35.611
STANDS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT

03:07:35.677 --> 03:07:37.312
WOULD BE A TOPIC FOR

03:07:37.379 --> 03:07:39.514
CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD -- A

03:07:39.581 --> 03:07:41.550
WE HAVE A FEW ITEMS FIRST OF ALL

03:07:41.617 --> 03:07:43.518
THE BILL APPEARS TO REQUIRE THAT

03:07:43.585 --> 03:07:44.820
THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT BE

03:07:44.886 --> 03:07:47.222
AN EXISTING LOAD SERVING ENTITY --

AND WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE

03:07:49.424 --> 03:07:51.059
THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:07:51.126 --> 03:07:53.261
ASSIGN THIS FUNCTION TO A STATE

03:07:53.328 --> 03:07:54.262
AGENCY OR AN INDEPENDENT

03:07:54.329 --> 03:07:56.198
NONPROFIT THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE

03:07:57.833 --> 03:07:58.500
CUSTOMERS.

03:07:58.567 --> 03:07:59.968
JUST AN EXAMPLE OF A PROVISION

03:08:00.035 --> 03:08:01.770
OF THE BILL THAT MIGHT IN IT.

03:08:01.837 --> 03:08:03.305
IN A VERDANT LEE RESTRICT --

ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS ALSO

03:08:06.475 --> 03:08:08.143
WE'D LIKE TO SEE A GREATER

03:08:08.210 --> 03:08:10.112

PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT TO SERVE

03:08:16.218 --> 03:08:17.619
ITS CUSTOMERS WERE NOT SEEN.

03:08:17.686 --> 03:08:19.221
ENOUGH THERE -- TO MAKE US

03:08:19.287 --> 03:08:20.389
COMFORTABLE.

03:08:20.455 --> 03:08:22.024
IT ALSO DOESN'T ESTABLISH THE PC

03:08:22.090 --> 03:08:23.892
CAN REGULATE RATES CHARGED BY

03:08:23.959 --> 03:08:25.127
THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT TO

WERE TO SO CHOOSE.

03:08:41.009 --> 03:08:42.277
AND FINALLY THE BILL DOESN'T

03:08:42.344 --> 03:08:43.812
REALLY EXPLAIN THE RANGE OF

03:08:43.879 --> 03:08:44.813
FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD BE

03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:46.415
PERFORMED BY A PROVIDER OF LAST

03:08:47.749 --> 03:08:49.084
ELECTRICAL SERVICE.

03:08:49.151 --> 03:08:50.852
BUT WE'RE NOT SURE HOW MANY

03:08:50.919 --> 03:08:52.187
DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THAT MIGHT

03:08:52.254 --> 03:08:54.256
ENCOMPASS -- AND IT MIGHT

03:08:54.322 --> 03:08:55.957
ARTIFICIALLY CONSTRAIN THE PC

03:08:56.024 --> 03:08:57.426

03:08:59.861 --> 03:09:00.562
THIS ENTITY.

03:09:00.629 --> 03:09:02.264
SO WE'RE JUST IDENTIFYING THESE

03:09:02.330 --> 03:09:03.799
AS GAPS IN THE ARCHITECTURE WE

03:09:03.865 --> 03:09:05.267

THAT KIND OF WAS AHEAD OF ITS

03:17:01.342 --> 03:17:03.378
TIME IN IDENTIFYING THE NEED FOR

03:17:03.444 --> 03:17:04.846
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES.

03:17:04.913 --> 03:17:06.181
WE TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY TO

03:17:06.247 --> 03:17:08.550
PROPOSE SEVEN PROJECTS ON WILD

03:17:08.616 --> 03:17:09.651
FIRE MITIGATION.

03:17:09.717 --> 03:17:12.353
THAT DECISION IS PENDING FOR THE

03:17:12.420 --> 03:17:14.289
PC AND ACTUALLY TAKES A THE

03:17:14.355 --> 03:17:15.924
REJECTS WERE HOPING TO GET THAT

03:17:15.990 --> 03:17:16.958
TURNED AROUND.

03:17:17.025 --> 03:17:18.359
BUT WE THINK CUSTOMER OWNED

03:17:18.426 --> 03:17:20.395
MICRO GRIDS ARE AN ESSENTIAL

03:17:20.461 --> 03:17:22.797
PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WHEN WE

03:17:22.864 --> 03:17:24.199
IMPLEMENTED OUR DE ENERGIZING

03:17:24.265 --> 03:17:25.233
PROGRAMS.

03:17:25.300 --> 03:17:26.834
WE DID SOME ENGINEERING WORK TO

03:17:26.901 --> 03:17:28.770
TRY TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF WHO

03:17:28.836 --> 03:17:30.138
WOULD BE IMPACTED THIS WOULD BE

03:17:30.205 --> 03:17:32.273
ANOTHER MITIGATION TOOL TO

03:17:32.340 --> 03:17:33.942
LESSEN THE IMPACTS ON CUSTOMERS.

03:17:34.008 --> 03:17:35.109
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

03:17:35.176 --> 03:17:36.444
AUTHOR -- WE THINK THIS A VERY

03:17:36.511 --> 03:17:38.213
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD WE ALSO

03:17:38.279 --> 03:17:40.548
POINTED OUT -- THIS PROGRAM IN

03:17:40.615 --> 03:17:42.050
OUR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN

03:17:42.116 --> 03:17:43.785
THAT WAS FILED COUPLE MONTHS AGO

03:17:43.851 --> 03:17:45.453
MORE OPEN THE PC WILL PROVE THAT.

03:17:45.520 --> 03:17:47.055
IN A TIMELY MATTER AND WE CAN GO

03:17:47.121 --> 03:17:55.029
FORWARD WITH -- ADDITIONAL

03:17:55.096 --> 03:17:57.532
MISSED MITIGATION MEASURES.

AND WE ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING

03:18:38.306 --> 03:18:39.974
THE ROLE FOR MICROGRAPHS BUT

03:18:40.041 --> 03:18:41.876
WE'RE CONCERNED THIS BILL --

03:18:41.943 --> 03:18:43.411
INAPPROPRIATELY PRIORITIZES

03:18:43.478 --> 03:18:44.679
POTENTIALLY EXPENSIVE MIKE

REGRET INVESTMENTS WITHOUT

03:18:46.914 --> 03:18:47.915
EFFECTIVE.

03:18:47.982 --> 03:18:49.584
AND LEAST COST OPTION FOR

PROMOTING GRADE RELIABILITY AND

03:18:51.452 --> 03:18:53.554
RESILIENCY -- THE BILL DOES NOT

03:18:53.621 --> 03:18:54.589
ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT

03:18:54.656 --> 03:18:56.157
UTILITIES HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS

03:18:56.224 --> 03:18:57.025
OF DOLLARS DURING THE LAST

03:18:57.091 --> 03:18:57.825
DECADE.

03:18:57.892 --> 03:18:59.560
IN MODERN GREAT TECHNOLOGIES

03:18:59.627 --> 03:19:01.095
INCLUDING SENSOR SWITCHES AND

03:19:01.162 --> 03:19:03.097
COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT --

03:19:03.164 --> 03:19:04.399
PRECISELY TO PROMOTE RESILIENCY

03:19:04.465 --> 03:19:06.367
DURING PLANNED AND UNPLANNED

03:19:06.434 --> 03:19:08.569
OUTAGES -- DOES SOLUTION OF A

03:19:08.636 --> 03:19:10.705
MICROGRAM MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE

03:19:10.772 --> 03:19:12.507
MOST APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO

03:19:12.573 --> 03:19:14.275
CONCERNS ABOUT RESILIENCY --

03:19:14.342 --> 03:19:15.610
THEY ARE POTENTIALLY VERY

03:19:15.677 --> 03:19:18.046
EXPENSIVE AND THAT'S WHERE WE

03:19:18.112 --> 03:19:19.814
GET TO OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE

03:19:19.881 --> 03:19:21.783
RATE PAYER INTEREST STANDARD

03:19:21.849 --> 03:19:23.318
THAT IS ARTICULATED IN THE BILL --

03:19:23.384 --> 03:19:25.286
THERE'S A REFERENCE SECTION

03:19:25.353 --> 03:19:26.087
SEVEN FORTY POINT EIGHT AS THE

03:19:26.154 --> 03:19:27.422
BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN

03:19:27.488 --> 03:19:29.223
INVESTMENT IS IN THE RATEPAYERS

03:19:29.290 --> 03:19:31.459
INTEREST -- AND IT IS -- IS A

03:19:31.526 --> 03:19:32.794
PARTICULAR PROVISION THAT IS

03:19:32.860 --> 03:19:35.330
NARROW IT'S USED IN THE CONTEXT

03:19:35.396 --> 03:19:36.564
OF PROMOTING.

03:19:36.631 --> 03:19:39.000
LOW EMISSIONS TRANSPORTATION AND

03:19:39.067 --> 03:19:40.301
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION.

03:19:40.368 --> 03:19:42.036
I INVESTMENTS IN OUR VIEW THE

03:19:42.103 --> 03:19:43.638
STANDARD DOESN'T REALLY WORK FOR

03:19:43.705 --> 03:19:45.373
THIS PURPOSE -- BECAUSE IT

03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:47.308
DOESN'T CONSIDER THE COSTS AND

03:19:47.375 --> 03:19:49.077
BENEFITS TO THE BROAD GROUP OF

03:19:49.143 --> 03:19:51.446
RATE PAYERS WHO HAVE TO FOOT THE

03:19:51.512 --> 03:19:52.880
BILL FOR THIS -- WE THINK THAT

03:19:52.947 --> 03:19:53.815
MICHAEL GREAT INVESTMENTS THAT

03:19:53.881 --> 03:19:55.183
ARE FUNDED BY THE UTILITIES

03:19:55.249 --> 03:19:56.317
SHOULD BE EVALUATED USING

03:19:56.384 --> 03:19:58.686
TRADITIONAL ANALYSES FOR THE

03:19:58.753 --> 03:19:59.220
BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THE

03:19:59.287 --> 03:20:00.088
INVESTMENT.

03:20:00.154 --> 03:20:02.023
ON END CONSIDERING THE COSTS OF

03:20:02.090 --> 03:20:03.458
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO

03:20:03.524 --> 03:20:04.926
SOLVING THE SAME PROBLEM.

03:20:04.992 --> 03:20:05.960
ON IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THE

03:20:06.027 --> 03:20:08.196
BILL CURRENTLY CONSIDERS THE PC

03:20:08.262 --> 03:20:09.530
ALLOWS THE PC TO COMPARE THE

03:20:09.597 --> 03:20:10.932
BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THESE

03:20:10.998 --> 03:20:13.034
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES -- IN

03:20:13.101 --> 03:20:14.369
ADDITION THERE IS A COST

03:20:14.435 --> 03:20:16.104
RECOVERY PROVISION THAT DIRECTS

03:20:16.170 --> 03:20:17.405
THE RECOVERY OF COSTS IN

03:20:17.472 --> 03:20:19.140
PROPORTION TO THE BENEFITS

03:20:19.207 --> 03:20:20.508
RECEIVED BY VARIOUS GROUPS OF

03:20:20.575 --> 03:20:22.810
REPAIRS WERE NOT SURE WHAT THIS

03:20:22.877 --> 03:20:23.144
MEANS.

03:20:23.211 --> 03:20:24.078
THE COSTS.

03:20:24.145 --> 03:20:25.446
MAY OR MAY NOT END UP GETTING

03:20:25.513 --> 03:20:26.881
RECOVERED FROM NON PARTICIPANT

03:20:26.948 --> 03:20:28.449
CUSTOMERS VERSUS PARTICIPANTS WE

03:20:28.516 --> 03:20:29.183
THINK THAT THERE'S A

03:20:29.250 --> 03:20:30.518
CLARIFICATION HERE.

03:20:30.585 --> 03:20:31.819
THAT ANY COST SHOULD BE

03:20:31.886 --> 03:20:33.221
RECOVERED FROM ALL CUSTOMERS ON

03:20:33.287 --> 03:20:35.123
A NON BY PASSABLE BASIS BECAUSE

03:20:35.189 --> 03:20:36.124
THE CURRENT LANGUAGE WILL

03:20:36.190 --> 03:20:38.359
GUARANTEE A LOT OF LITIGATION

03:20:38.426 --> 03:20:39.727
OVER WHAT IT MAY OR MAY NOT MEAN.

03:20:39.794 --> 03:20:42.497
ON AND THEN FINALLY WE WOULD

03:20:42.563 --> 03:20:42.864
JUST.

03:20:42.930 --> 03:20:43.898
THE BILL REQUIRES THAT ANY

03:20:43.965 --> 03:20:46.234
MICROGRAM VESTMENTS BY A UTILITY

03:20:46.300 --> 03:20:48.035
SHALL EARN A REASONABLE RATE OF

03:20:48.102 --> 03:20:49.704
RETURN.

03:20:49.771 --> 03:20:50.638
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER

03:20:50.705 --> 03:20:51.606
TRADITIONAL CAPITAL

03:20:51.672 --> 03:20:53.174
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THIS

03:20:53.241 --> 03:20:55.209
IS A MISSTATEMENT OF EXISTING

03:20:55.276 --> 03:20:56.110
ALONG.

03:20:56.177 --> 03:20:57.979
EXISTING LAW SETS RATES SO THAT

03:20:58.045 --> 03:21:00.214
UTILITIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:21:00.281 --> 03:21:01.149
RECOVER THEIR RATE OF RETURN

03:21:01.215 --> 03:21:02.750
THEY ARE NOT GUARANTEED THE RATE

03:21:02.817 --> 03:21:04.018
OF RETURN THAT IS.

03:21:04.085 --> 03:21:05.820
PART OF THE RISK FACTOR THAT

03:21:05.887 --> 03:21:06.387
GOES INTO SETTING THIS COST

03:21:06.454 --> 03:21:08.389
CAPITAL -- AND I WOULD JUST

03:21:08.456 --> 03:21:09.724
CAUTION THE COMMITTEE GIVEN THE

03:21:09.791 --> 03:21:10.992
RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE THREE

03:21:11.058 --> 03:21:12.927
MAJOR UTILITIES THAT THEY INTEND

03:21:12.994 --> 03:21:15.763
TO SEEK HUGE INCREASES IN THEIR

03:21:15.830 --> 03:21:16.364
RATES OF RETURN ON SHAREHOLDER

03:21:16.431 --> 03:21:17.432
EQUITY.

03:21:17.498 --> 03:21:18.433
IT'S REALLY NOT A PRO TO

03:21:18.499 --> 03:21:20.301
ESTABLISH NEW RIGHTS FOR

03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:22.804
RECOVERY OF SHAREHOLDER COST

03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:24.372
INSURER EQUITY.

03:21:24.439 --> 03:21:26.307
RETURNS -- AS PART OF STATE

03:21:26.374 --> 03:21:28.075
LEGISLATION SO WE HAVE BE HAPPY

03:21:28.142 --> 03:21:29.110
TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS

03:21:29.177 --> 03:21:31.712
WE ARE TRYING TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE

03:21:31.779 --> 03:21:32.713
IN OUR FEEDBACK.

03:21:32.780 --> 03:21:33.681
THANKS.

03:21:33.748 --> 03:21:34.148
I THINK THAT WAS VERY

03:21:34.215 --> 03:21:35.683
CONSTRUCTIVE.

03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:37.785
OKAY ANYONE ELSE US STEVE YOU

03:21:37.852 --> 03:21:40.354
ARE -- I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS WE

03:21:40.421 --> 03:21:41.689
NEED TO STOP USING THESE TRYST

03:21:41.756 --> 03:21:43.958
TRADITIONAL WAYS OF EVALUATING

03:21:44.025 --> 03:21:46.994
THE AT THE GRID -- THESE.

03:21:47.061 --> 03:21:48.162
I'M A MANUFACTURING ENGINEER

03:21:48.229 --> 03:21:50.765
WORKED IN THE FORTY YEARS.

03:21:50.832 --> 03:21:53.401
I AT I I AM TOTALLY AMAZED THIS

03:21:53.468 --> 03:21:55.303
IS CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S A

03:21:55.369 --> 03:21:56.471
COLLECTION A SPREADSHEET.

03:21:56.537 --> 03:21:58.906
THAT ARE USED TO TRY TO FIGURE

03:21:58.973 --> 03:22:01.409
OUT THAT'S WHERE THE TOP CARD.

03:22:01.476 --> 03:22:02.610
OF CAME INTO SIGHT [inaudible]

03:22:02.677 --> 03:22:04.512
DOT CHART.

03:22:04.579 --> 03:22:06.113
WE KNOW THE SUN RISES EVERY DAY

03:22:06.180 --> 03:22:07.682
WE DON'T WE NEED TO GO TO

03:22:07.748 --> 03:22:09.250
DISCRETE EVENT SCHEDULING THE

03:22:09.317 --> 03:22:11.719
KIND OF THING THAT TOYOTA USES

03:22:11.786 --> 03:22:14.055
TO BUILD CARS JUST IN TIME.

03:22:14.121 --> 03:22:16.524
I ANALOG SCHEDULING.

03:22:16.591 --> 03:22:19.994
IS BATCHING Q..

03:22:20.061 --> 03:22:22.697
SO YOU YOU SAY ALL I GET SO MUCH.

03:22:22.763 --> 03:22:23.531
AND YOU ACT AS IF YOU HAVE

03:22:23.598 --> 03:22:25.700
STORAGE I'VE EVEN HAD PEOPLE --

03:22:25.766 --> 03:22:27.869
IT HURT PEOPLE'S TALK ABOUT

03:22:27.935 --> 03:22:32.907
THINGS IN TERMS OF 30% CAPACITY.

03:22:32.974 --> 03:22:34.475
BUT A IF YOU LOOK AT WIND I

03:22:34.542 --> 03:22:35.910
TAKEN ALL CAL ISEL STUFF YOU

03:22:35.977 --> 03:22:39.413
LOOK AT HOW UNRELIABLE WIND IS.

03:22:39.480 --> 03:22:40.781
AND YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE OTHER --

03:22:40.848 --> 03:22:42.450
SITUATIONS USE YOU LOOK AT THIS

03:22:42.517 --> 03:22:45.586
DATA.

03:22:45.653 --> 03:22:46.821
YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO CHANGE.

03:22:46.888 --> 03:22:49.290
SENATOR BRADFORD'S STASHED

03:22:49.357 --> 03:22:51.158
STORAGE THING.

03:22:51.225 --> 03:22:52.360
I PUBLIC IN THIS AND I'M SAYING

03:22:52.426 --> 03:22:53.961
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME TO HAVE

03:22:54.028 --> 03:22:54.562
ALL THESE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT

03:22:54.629 --> 03:22:56.264
THIS.

03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:57.798
THESE ANSWERS ARE TOLD THEY ARE

03:22:57.865 --> 03:23:00.101
THERE WE ENDED THE MECHANISMS

03:23:00.167 --> 03:23:00.668
ARE THEY ARE THE COMMISSION

03:23:00.735 --> 03:23:04.105
DOESN'T USE THEM I'VE DOCKET IT.

03:23:04.171 --> 03:23:06.507
BASIC SYSTEMS NOBODY EVEN CUT

03:23:06.574 --> 03:23:07.942
ASK ME WHAT WHAT'S THIS DO OR

03:23:08.009 --> 03:23:12.780
HOW'S THIS WORK -- I WOULD LIKE

03:23:12.847 --> 03:23:14.749
TO SEE TO IT. TO TALK WITH --

03:23:14.815 --> 03:23:16.551
WITH ANYBODY ON THIS WE EXCHANGE

03:23:16.617 --> 03:23:18.352
THIS.

03:23:18.419 --> 03:23:21.422
IT'S JUST CLIMATE CHANGE WE

03:23:21.489 --> 03:23:23.124

THAT MIKE READS WORK EFFECTIVELY

03:24:29.490 --> 03:24:30.157
IN AN EMERGENCY.

IS THERE EVIDENCE I WOULD GO TO

03:24:31.425 --> 03:24:33.027
OUR EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN

03:24:33.094 --> 03:24:34.328
DEPLOYED ON THE FIELD.

03:24:34.395 --> 03:24:35.730
BEEN USING THEM AT THEIR

03:24:35.796 --> 03:24:36.263
CRITICAL CIRCUITS FROM MY

03:24:36.330 --> 03:24:37.365
UNDERSTANDING COSTS YES WE HAVE

03:24:37.431 --> 03:24:40.801
US SOME EXPERIENCE WE'VE GOT --

03:24:40.868 --> 03:24:43.037
A COUPLE OF I CORPORATES ARE IN

03:24:43.104 --> 03:24:44.905
EXISTENCE AND WE HAVE -- OTHERS

03:24:44.972 --> 03:24:47.708
THAT WE SET UP. ONE OF THEM IS

03:24:47.775 --> 03:24:50.244
FOR A LOCAL TRIBE -- THE WE SET

03:24:50.311 --> 03:24:50.778
UP AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN

03:24:50.845 --> 03:24:51.879
EFFECTIVE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

03:24:51.946 --> 03:24:54.548
YOU HAVE TO HAVE COVERED THOUGH

03:24:54.615 --> 03:24:56.283
IS IF ALL YOUR LINES ARE ABOVE

03:24:56.350 --> 03:24:57.318
GROUND.

03:24:57.385 --> 03:24:58.152
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DE

03:24:58.219 --> 03:24:59.820
ENERGIZED BECAUSE OF WEATHER

03:24:59.887 --> 03:25:01.455
CONDITIONS AND TREES OR ANYTHING

03:25:01.522 --> 03:25:03.024
FLYING AROUND.

03:25:03.090 --> 03:25:04.759
THAT'S AN INHIBITOR BUT IF YOU

03:25:04.825 --> 03:25:06.727
HAVE THE THE DESIGN AND

03:25:06.794 --> 03:25:08.396
ENGINEERING IS DONE WITHIN THAT.

03:25:08.462 --> 03:25:09.697
DEFINED AREA WHERE YOU'RE

03:25:09.764 --> 03:25:11.032
SEEKING TO PROTECT IT.

03:25:11.098 --> 03:25:12.500
THEY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.

03:25:12.566 --> 03:25:14.402
ENSURE POWER.

03:25:14.468 --> 03:25:16.137
AND SHARE POWER WITH OTHER.

03:25:16.203 --> 03:25:18.005
YES YEAH OUR IDEA IN THIS IS

03:25:18.072 --> 03:25:20.007
DEVELOPING IT FOR A LARGER

03:25:20.074 --> 03:25:21.008
SYSTEM WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO

03:25:21.075 --> 03:25:22.410
DEVELOP IT FOR ONE PROJECT

03:25:22.476 --> 03:25:23.244
CUSTOMER.

03:25:23.310 --> 03:25:25.046
BUT MORE IN A CIRCUIT OR ON A

03:25:25.112 --> 03:25:27.014
REGIONAL BASIS A LOT OF TIMES IN

03:25:27.081 --> 03:25:27.581
OUR SERVICE TERRITORY NEEDS

03:25:27.648 --> 03:25:28.482
COUNTY.

03:25:28.549 --> 03:25:31.318
THE WEATHER CONDITIONS MIGHT BE.

03:25:31.385 --> 03:25:32.787
ADVERSE OUTSIDE OF THAT

03:25:32.853 --> 03:25:35.322
IMMEDIATE AREA BUT THE

03:25:35.389 --> 03:25:36.524
TRANSMISSION LINES SPEEDING UP.

03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:38.059
DON'T GIVE US ANY OTHER OPTIONS

03:25:38.125 --> 03:25:39.260
IN THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU

03:25:39.326 --> 03:25:40.828
CAN BRING -- MICROGROOVE INTO

03:25:40.895 --> 03:25:42.129
THAT COMMUNITY AND NOT HAVE TO

03:25:42.196 --> 03:25:44.031
RELY ON THAT.

03:25:44.098 --> 03:25:46.300
EXTERNAL TRANSMISSION SOURCE

03:25:46.367 --> 03:25:46.901
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

03:25:46.967 --> 03:25:47.268
THAT WERE LIKE.

03:25:47.334 --> 03:25:49.136
WHEN THERE'S AN OUTAGE WHAT DOES

03:25:49.203 --> 03:25:50.905
IT MEAN TO BE IRELAND DID?

03:25:50.971 --> 03:25:52.306
ADD MAJOR DISCONNECTED FROM THE

03:25:52.373 --> 03:25:54.809
LARGER GRID AN ISLAND COULD BE

03:25:54.875 --> 03:25:57.144
OF PARTICULAR.

03:25:57.211 --> 03:25:59.714
THERE ARE STILL MAINTAINING

03:25:59.780 --> 03:26:01.549
POWER COULD BE A LARGER.

03:26:01.615 --> 03:26:02.583
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WELL ALL

03:26:02.650 --> 03:26:04.518
DEPENDS ON HOW YOUR SYSTEM IS

03:26:04.585 --> 03:26:06.087
ENGINEERED AND YOUR DIFFERENT

03:26:06.153 --> 03:26:08.456
PATHS TO GET THERE YOU CAN GET

03:26:08.522 --> 03:26:10.257

03:42:07.313 --> 03:42:08.481
UTILITIES ACOSS THE STATE AND

03:42:08.548 --> 03:42:09.582
IT WOULD UNDERMINE ONE OF THE

03:42:09.649 --> 03:42:10.684
MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST

03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:13.286
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS FOR CLEAN

03:42:13.353 --> 03:42:14.387
ENERGY ADVANCEMENT IN OUR STATE.

03:42:14.454 --> 03:42:16.089
BY AND LARGE LARGE HYDRO CROSS

03:42:16.156 --> 03:42:17.757
THE COUNTRY ACROSS OUR PS

03:42:17.824 --> 03:42:20.326
PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY IS NOT.

03:42:20.393 --> 03:42:21.895
YES ELIGIBLE BECAUSE ONE OF THE

03:42:21.961 --> 03:42:24.264
PRIMARY PURPOSES OF IN OUR PS IS

03:42:24.330 --> 03:42:25.365
TO ENCOURAGE.

03:42:25.432 --> 03:42:26.900
INVESTMENT IN NEW CLEAN ENERGY

03:42:26.966 --> 03:42:29.602
RESOURCES AND REDUCE RELIANCE ON

03:42:29.669 --> 03:42:30.637
FOSSIL RESOURCES.

03:42:30.704 --> 03:42:32.772
CALIFORNIA VERY DELIBERATELY

03:42:32.839 --> 03:42:34.441
EXCLUDED LARGE HYDRO FROM ITS

03:42:34.507 --> 03:42:36.776
OUR PS BECAUSE SOME UTILITIES IN

03:42:36.843 --> 03:42:38.211
CALIFORNIA HAVE A LOT OF IT

03:42:38.278 --> 03:42:39.245
ESPECIALLY DURING GOOD WATER

03:42:39.312 --> 03:42:40.013
YEARS.

03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:40.947
AND IT WOULD CREATE A VERY

03:42:41.014 --> 03:42:42.549
UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR

03:42:42.615 --> 03:42:43.883
UTILITIES IN TERMS OF MEETING

03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:45.185
THERE ARE YES MEETING SOME

03:42:45.251 --> 03:42:46.886
UTILITIES WOULD HAVE A VERY LOW

03:42:46.953 --> 03:42:48.455
COMPLIANCE BURDEN WHILE OTHER

03:42:48.521 --> 03:42:49.622
ONES WOULD HAVE A VERY HIGH

03:42:49.689 --> 03:42:51.891
COMPLIANCE BURDEN. FOR EXAMPLE

03:42:51.958 --> 03:42:53.093
IF THIS BILL PASSED TURLOCK

03:42:53.159 --> 03:42:54.394
IRRIGATION DISTRICTS WOULD

03:42:54.461 --> 03:42:56.229
LIKELY NOT NEED TO MAKE ANY

03:42:56.296 --> 03:42:58.431
CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS. FOR A

03:42:58.498 --> 03:43:00.600
GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS ALMOST A

03:43:00.667 --> 03:43:01.267
DECADE.

03:43:01.334 --> 03:43:02.802
WHILE CONTINUING TO RELY ON

03:43:02.869 --> 03:43:04.738
NATURAL GAS AN UNSPECIFIED

03:43:04.804 --> 03:43:05.905
MARKET PURCHASES FOR A

03:43:05.972 --> 03:43:07.407
SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF ITS RETAIL

03:43:07.474 --> 03:43:09.843
SALES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT

03:43:09.909 --> 03:43:11.311
WAS 40%.

03:43:11.377 --> 03:43:12.679
WE'RE NOBLES TODAY ARE EXTREMELY

03:43:12.746 --> 03:43:14.380
COST EFFECTIVE AND THE PROVIDE

03:43:14.447 --> 03:43:15.949
BENEFITS TO GO BEYOND CARBON

03:43:16.015 --> 03:43:17.484
CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY PASSED ITS

03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:20.086
FIRST OUR PS IN TWO THOUSAND TWO

03:43:20.153 --> 03:43:20.620
BECAUSE IT WANTED TO MAKE

03:43:20.687 --> 03:43:22.155
UTILITIES LESS VULNERABLE TO

03:43:22.222 --> 03:43:24.190
SUPPLY SHORTAGES FROM ANY ONE

03:43:24.257 --> 03:43:26.059
FUEL TYPE. ONE OF THE MAJOR

03:43:26.126 --> 03:43:27.594
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS

03:43:27.660 --> 03:43:29.195
GOING TO BE HIGH HOTTER AND

03:43:29.262 --> 03:43:31.097
DRIER WEATHER WHICH MEANS LESS

03:43:31.164 --> 03:43:33.233
ABILITY TO GENERATE HYDROPOWER

03:43:33.299 --> 03:43:34.434
OVER TIME.

03:43:34.501 --> 03:43:35.769
WHEN A UTILITY IS HEAVILY

03:43:35.835 --> 03:43:37.871
RELIANT ON LARGE HYDRO AND FINDS

03:43:37.937 --> 03:43:39.405
A WAY TO NOT MAKE INVESTMENT IN

03:43:39.472 --> 03:43:40.473
RENEWABLES?

03:43:40.540 --> 03:43:41.508
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA PURCHASE

03:43:41.574 --> 03:43:42.809
DURING THE DRY YEARS THEY'RE

03:43:42.876 --> 03:43:44.177
GOING TO HAVE TO SCRAMBLE AND

03:43:44.244 --> 03:43:45.044
THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO

03:43:45.111 --> 03:43:46.513
PURCHASE NATURAL GAS AND THAT'S

03:43:46.579 --> 03:43:49.349
NOT GOOD FOR REPAIRS AND THAT'S

03:43:49.415 --> 03:43:49.949
NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT?

03:43:50.016 --> 03:43:51.151
FINALLY THERE ARE ALREADY

03:43:51.217 --> 03:43:52.352
PROVISIONS IN THE LAW THAT

03:43:52.418 --> 03:43:53.453
PROVIDE UTILITIES WITH

03:43:53.520 --> 03:43:54.654
FLEXIBILITY IF THEY CAN'T MEET

03:43:54.721 --> 03:43:56.122
THEIR OUR PS TARGETS FOR A

03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:57.824
VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING

03:43:57.891 --> 03:43:58.992
COSTS.

03:43:59.058 --> 03:43:59.726
WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS

03:43:59.793 --> 03:44:01.294
UNNECESSARY AND WOULD CREATE AN

03:44:01.361 --> 03:44:03.196
OPENING FOR OTHER UTILITIES WITH

03:44:03.263 --> 03:44:05.064
HYDRO IN THEIR PORTFOLIO. TO ASK

03:44:05.131 --> 03:44:06.299
FOR SIMILAR TREATMENT WHICH

03:44:06.366 --> 03:44:07.934
WOULD UNDERMINE THE PROGRAM FOR

03:44:08.001 --> 03:44:09.903
THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY

03:44:09.969 --> 03:44:14.674
REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU.

03:44:14.741 --> 03:44:15.375
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

03:44:15.441 --> 03:44:16.309
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT

03:44:16.376 --> 03:44:17.644
FREEMAN ON BEHALF OF TURN WE'RE

03:44:17.710 --> 03:44:19.312
HERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO

03:44:19.379 --> 03:44:20.413
THIS BILL.

03:44:20.480 --> 03:44:21.981
I'M AS I'M IS WHISTLING POINTED

03:44:22.048 --> 03:44:23.349
OUT THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

03:44:23.416 --> 03:44:24.884
STANDARD IS THE CENTRAL POLICY

03:44:24.951 --> 03:44:26.486
MECHANISM THAT THE STATE HAS TO

03:44:26.553 --> 03:44:28.321
ACHIEVE ITS LONG TERM CLIMATE

03:44:28.388 --> 03:44:30.223
AND ENERGY GOALS AND THIS BILL

03:44:30.290 --> 03:44:31.524
UNFORTUNATELY.

03:44:31.591 --> 03:44:33.326
WOULD DO SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO

03:44:33.393 --> 03:44:35.795
THE DURABILITY AND SUCCESS OF

03:44:35.862 --> 03:44:37.363
THE STATE'S OUR PS PROGRAM.

03:44:37.430 --> 03:44:39.866
IT'S ALSO COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY

03:44:39.933 --> 03:44:41.768
I'M AND IT WOULD PROVIDE UNFAIR

03:44:41.835 --> 03:44:44.137
TREATMENT TO ONE SET OF RETAIL

03:44:44.204 --> 03:44:45.071
PROVIDERS.

03:44:45.138 --> 03:44:47.307
THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN STEPS

03:44:47.373 --> 03:44:48.575
IN RECENT YEARS TO ACCOMMODATE

03:44:48.641 --> 03:44:50.777
THE SITUATION FOR PUBLICLY OWNED

03:44:50.844 --> 03:44:52.145
UTILITIES THAT HAVE A LARGE

03:44:52.212 --> 03:44:54.647
SHARE OF HYDROELECTRIC

03:44:54.714 --> 03:44:55.915
GENERATION IN THEIR PORTFOLIOS.

03:44:55.982 --> 03:44:57.383
THERE HAVE BEEN PROVISIONS IN SB

03:44:57.450 --> 03:44:58.785
THREE FIFTY AN SP ONE HUNDRED TO

03:44:58.852 --> 03:45:00.453
ADDRESS UTILITIES THAT HAVE HIGH

03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:02.555
RELIANCE ON IN ADDITION THE

03:45:02.622 --> 03:45:04.190
LEGISLATURE HAS ADOPTED A COST

03:45:04.257 --> 03:45:04.991
CAP.

03:45:05.058 --> 03:45:06.226
THAT HAS BEEN UTILIZED BY THE

03:45:06.292 --> 03:45:07.694
MERCED IRRIGATION DISTRICT IN

03:45:07.760 --> 03:45:09.796
OTHER WORDS IF IT COSTS TOO MUCH

03:45:09.863 --> 03:45:11.164
TO COMPLY WITH THE OUR PS

03:45:11.231 --> 03:45:11.898
TARGETS.

03:45:11.965 --> 03:45:13.566
AND IRRIGATION DISTRICT HAS THE

03:45:13.633 --> 03:45:15.969
RIGHT. TO ESTABLISH A COST CAP

03:45:16.035 --> 03:45:17.904
AND TO EXERCISE THAT COST CAP AS

03:45:17.971 --> 03:45:19.339
A WAY TO PREVENT IT FROM BUYING

03:45:19.405 --> 03:45:21.007
RESOURCES THAT IN THE WORDS OF

03:45:21.074 --> 03:45:21.875
THE SPONSORS.

03:45:21.941 --> 03:45:23.476
THEY DON'T NEED AND THEY FIND TO

03:45:23.543 --> 03:45:25.044
BE TOO EXPENSIVE.

03:45:25.111 --> 03:45:28.114
WE BELIEVE THIS ISSUE HAS

03:45:28.181 --> 03:45:28.648
FUNDAMENTALLY ALREADY BEEN

03:45:28.715 --> 03:45:29.082
ADDRESSED.

03:45:29.148 --> 03:45:30.483
PROBLEM IS THAT THE INCLUSION OF

03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:31.951
A LARGE HYDROELECTRIC ASSETS IN

03:45:32.018 --> 03:45:33.853
THE OUR PS PROGRAM WOULD SIMPLY

03:45:33.920 --> 03:45:35.855
UP AND THE CAREFULLY DEVELOPED

03:45:35.922 --> 03:45:37.891
ELIGIBILITY RULES AND IT COULD

03:45:37.957 --> 03:45:39.626
LEAD TO A MASSIVE REDUCTION IN

03:45:39.692 --> 03:45:41.661
THE ANTICIPATED QUAL QUANTITY OF

03:45:41.728 --> 03:45:43.496
NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY.

03:45:43.563 --> 03:45:44.097
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE PRODUCED

03:45:44.163 --> 03:45:45.131
UNDER THE STANDARD.

03:45:45.198 --> 03:45:46.466
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW WE WOULD

03:45:46.532 --> 03:45:48.334
DISTINGUISH SITUATION FOR

03:45:48.401 --> 03:45:50.036
MODESTO INTERLOCK FROM THOSE OF

03:45:50.103 --> 03:45:51.537
MANY OF THE OTHER PUBLICLY OWNED

03:45:51.604 --> 03:45:53.039
AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT

03:45:53.106 --> 03:45:54.574
HAVE SUBSTANTIAL LARGE HYDRO

03:45:54.641 --> 03:45:55.642
ELECTRIC RESOURCES IN THEIR

03:45:55.708 --> 03:45:56.910
PORTFOLIO.

03:45:56.976 --> 03:45:58.311
IF EVERYONE WERE ALLOWED TO

03:45:58.378 --> 03:45:59.846
COUNT THOSE RESOURCES THAT OWN

03:45:59.913 --> 03:46:00.346
THEM.

03:46:00.413 --> 03:46:03.850
WE WOULD SEE APPROXIMATELY A 15%

03:46:03.917 --> 03:46:05.184
REDUCTION IN THE OUR PS.

03:46:05.251 --> 03:46:06.886
PROGRAM IN OTHER WORDS INSTEAD

03:46:06.953 --> 03:46:08.888
OF UTILITIES HAVING TO GET 233%

03:46:08.955 --> 03:46:10.657
BY TWENTY TWENTY THEY WOULD ONLY

03:46:10.723 --> 03:46:13.293
HAVE TO GET EFFECTIVELY 218%.

03:46:13.359 --> 03:46:14.594
WHICH WOULD TAKE US WELL BELOW

03:46:14.661 --> 03:46:17.330
THE TARGETS THAT WERE ADOPTED IN

03:46:17.397 --> 03:46:17.931
TWO THOUSAND AND TWO BY THIS

03:46:17.997 --> 03:46:19.565
LEGISLATURE.

03:46:19.632 --> 03:46:20.133
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

03:46:20.199 --> 03:46:21.334
APPROPRIATE.

03:46:21.401 --> 03:46:23.136
IN ADDITION I WOULD POINT OUT

03:46:23.202 --> 03:46:25.104
THAT BOTH TURLOCK AND MODESTO

03:46:25.171 --> 03:46:27.140
DID APPROVE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

03:46:27.206 --> 03:46:28.675
STANDARD PROCUREMENT PLANS IN

03:46:28.741 --> 03:46:30.009
NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER OF LAST

03:46:30.076 --> 03:46:32.845
YEAR AFTER THE ENACTMENT OF SB.

03:46:32.912 --> 03:46:33.479
ONE HUNDRED BOTH OF THOSE PLANS

03:46:33.546 --> 03:46:35.014
SHOW THAT THESE TWO IRRIGATION

03:46:35.081 --> 03:46:35.949
DISTRICTS.

03:46:36.015 --> 03:46:37.684
ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR

03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:38.985
EXISTING RESOURCE COMMITMENTS

03:46:39.052 --> 03:46:42.221
THROUGH THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

03:46:42.288 --> 03:46:42.755
FIVE UNDER THE ACCELERATED

03:46:42.822 --> 03:46:43.456
TARGETS.

03:46:43.523 --> 03:46:44.824
IT'S ARE CONCERNED THAT THE

03:46:44.891 --> 03:46:47.193
ADOPTION OF THE RELIEF REQUESTED

03:46:47.260 --> 03:46:49.462
AND SB THREE EIGHTY SIX WOULD

03:46:49.529 --> 03:46:52.198
RESULT IN ONE OF TWO OUTCOMES

03:46:52.265 --> 03:46:53.499
ONE NO NEW PROCUREMENT WOULD BE

03:46:53.566 --> 03:46:54.867
NEEDED BY THESE UTILITIES

03:46:54.934 --> 03:46:56.302
ESSENTIALLY IN PERPETUITY UNDER

03:46:56.369 --> 03:46:57.770
THE EXISTING OUR PS.

03:46:57.837 --> 03:46:59.605
BUT MORE TROUBLING IT APPEARS TO

03:46:59.672 --> 03:47:01.307
ALLOW THESE YOUR GEISHA

03:47:01.374 --> 03:47:03.176
DISTRICTS TO RESELL RENEWABLE

03:47:03.242 --> 03:47:04.577
POWER THEY ALREADY HAVE UNDER

03:47:04.644 --> 03:47:05.845
CONTRACT.

03:47:05.912 --> 03:47:07.046
ESSENTIALLY TO TAKE RESOURCES

03:47:07.113 --> 03:47:08.381
THAT THEY BOUGHT TO COMPLY WITH

03:47:08.448 --> 03:47:09.248
THE OUR PS IN ITS CURRENT

03:47:09.315 --> 03:47:11.651
CONFIGURATION AND TO REMARKET IT

03:47:11.718 --> 03:47:13.353
TO OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN

03:47:13.419 --> 03:47:14.420
ORDER TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THOSE

03:47:14.487 --> 03:47:15.555
INVESTMENTS.

03:47:15.621 --> 03:47:16.456
IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US THAT THE

03:47:16.522 --> 03:47:17.557
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS HAS

03:47:17.623 --> 03:47:19.659
ACCEPTED TODAY DO YOU PREVENT

03:47:19.726 --> 03:47:20.860
THAT OUTCOME.

03:47:20.927 --> 03:47:22.395
WE THINK AT A MINIMUM THE ENERGY

03:47:22.462 --> 03:47:23.262
COMMISSION SHOULD BE IN CHARGE

03:47:23.329 --> 03:47:25.465
OF OF ISSUING A REPORT TO STUDY

03:47:25.531 --> 03:47:26.899
THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF

03:47:26.966 --> 03:47:28.868
THESE CHANGES -- AND WE WOULD

03:47:28.935 --> 03:47:30.003
LIKE TO SEE THAT AMENDMENT FROM

03:47:30.069 --> 03:47:31.204
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ADOPTED

03:47:31.270 --> 03:47:32.905
BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WE BELIEVE

03:47:32.972 --> 03:47:35.241
THAT THE COST CAP LIMITATION.

03:47:35.308 --> 03:47:36.976
IS SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THE

03:47:37.043 --> 03:47:38.144
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THESE

03:47:38.211 --> 03:47:40.013
IRRIGATION DISTRICTS AND IF THIS

03:47:40.079 --> 03:47:41.547
BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD AND TO

03:47:41.614 --> 03:47:42.415
BECOME LAW.

03:47:42.482 --> 03:47:44.217
YOU CAN BE GUARANTEED THAT EVERY

03:47:44.283 --> 03:47:46.853
SINGLE HYDRO OWNING UTILITY WILL

03:47:46.919 --> 03:47:47.854
HAVE A BILL BEFORE THIS

03:47:47.920 --> 03:47:49.222
COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR SEEKING

03:47:49.288 --> 03:47:54.060
IDENTICAL RELIEF AND THAT WILL

DON'T NEED IT WE DON'T NEED IT

03:56:42.755 --> 03:56:44.156
IN THE STATE SO.

03:56:44.223 --> 03:56:45.558
WE ARE CREATING THIS OBLIGATION

EXPENSIVE SOLAR AND WIND

03:56:50.663 --> 03:56:52.698
PROJECTS AND THEN TO SELL OFF

03:56:52.765 --> 03:56:54.500

THE RATE PAYERS AND AND THAT'S

03:56:56.001 --> 03:56:57.870
THAT'S REALLY WHY YOU NEED WE

NEED THIS BILL NOW.

03:56:59.104 --> 03:57:00.239
IS BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE ARE

03:57:00.306 --> 03:57:01.407
PLANNING TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF

03:57:01.473 --> 03:57:02.641
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEW

03:57:02.708 --> 03:57:03.642
PROJECTS.

03:57:10.349 --> 03:57:11.984
HUNDRED PLACES ON THEM NUMBER

03:57:12.051 --> 03:57:13.352
ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT -- YOU

03:57:13.419 --> 03:57:14.920
KNOW I FIND IT INTERESTING AND I

03:57:14.987 --> 03:57:16.622
AND I REALLY WANNA I WAS GONNA

03:57:16.689 --> 03:57:19.325
TAKE THAT -- CENTER BRADFORD STE

03:57:19.391 --> 03:57:21.060
COMMENTS AS MY CLOTHES IS THAT

03:57:21.126 --> 03:57:22.227
THIS REALLY HIT ME YOU KNOW WHEN

03:57:22.294 --> 03:57:23.629
YOU WHEN WHEN PEOPLE START

03:57:23.696 --> 03:57:26.131
TALKING ABOUT UNFAIR TREATMENT.

03:57:26.198 --> 03:57:28.801
AND IT'LL UNDERMINE THE PROGRAM --

03:57:28.867 --> 03:57:30.669
IT KIND OF INFURIATES ME BECAUSE

03:57:30.736 --> 03:57:34.173
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT FOR THE

03:57:34.239 --> 03:57:35.374
MOST PART.

03:57:35.441 --> 03:57:36.575
ON I'M LEGISLATORS COME FROM

03:57:36.642 --> 03:57:38.577
URBAN AREAS AND THEY DESIGN THE

03:57:38.644 --> 03:57:40.846
RULES OF THE GAME TO TO BENEFIT

03:57:40.913 --> 03:57:43.115
URBAN AREAS AND THEN AS A AS A

03:57:43.182 --> 03:57:45.818
RULE RESIDENT AND LEGISLATOR

03:57:45.884 --> 03:57:47.219
TRYING TO GET INTO THE

03:57:47.286 --> 03:57:48.487
DISCUSSION BECOMES VERY

03:57:48.554 --> 03:57:50.723
DIFFICULT WHEN ANSWER SB.

03:57:50.789 --> 03:57:51.824
ONE HUNDRED WAS MAKING ITS WAY

03:57:51.890 --> 03:57:53.859
AROUND THE LEGISLATURE I TRIED

03:57:53.926 --> 03:57:55.227
VERY HARD TO GET.

03:57:55.294 --> 03:57:57.963
THIS KIND OF RELIEF FOR THE

03:57:58.030 --> 03:58:00.065
IRRIGATION THESE TO PUT TWO

03:58:00.132 --> 03:58:01.700
IRRIGATION DISTRICTS -- BECAUSE

03:58:01.767 --> 03:58:03.135
IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO THE

03:58:03.202 --> 03:58:04.770
RATE PAYERS TREMENDOUS

03:58:04.837 --> 03:58:07.339
DIFFERENCE TO THE RATE PAYERS --

03:58:07.406 --> 03:58:08.540
THE REASON THAT.

03:58:08.607 --> 03:58:11.410
HYDRO WAS NOT INCLUDED HAD TO DO

03:58:11.477 --> 03:58:13.012
WITH THIS AND INVESTMENT THAT WE

03:58:13.078 --> 03:58:15.247
WANTED TO MAKE IN OTHER FORMS OF

03:58:15.314 --> 03:58:16.715
ENERGY SO EVERYBODY.

03:58:16.782 --> 03:58:19.184
WAS GONNA GET TREATED THE SAME

03:58:19.251 --> 03:58:20.986
AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EQUAL

03:58:21.053 --> 03:58:23.722
TREATMENT IF IT IS ON THEY THEIR

03:58:23.789 --> 03:58:25.057
RATE PAYERS.

03:58:25.124 --> 03:58:26.458
HAVE BEEN HURT.

03:58:26.525 --> 03:58:28.160
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN MADE TO

03:58:28.227 --> 03:58:29.228
INVEST.

03:58:29.294 --> 03:58:31.263
IN WHAT IS REALLY GOOD ENERGY

03:58:31.330 --> 03:58:32.931
SOLAR AND AND WIND ENERGY IS

03:58:32.998 --> 03:58:34.533
TREMENDOUS ENERGY I'M NOT SAYING

03:58:34.600 --> 03:58:37.503
IT'S NOT BUT BUT AS CENTER

03:58:37.569 --> 03:58:39.638
BRADFORD SAID WE WE WERE REALLY

03:58:39.705 --> 03:58:40.472
LOOKING.

03:58:40.539 --> 03:58:42.041
AT THE REDUCTION OF FOSSIL FUELS

03:58:42.107 --> 03:58:44.910
WE WANTED TO GET OFF OF THAT AND

03:58:44.977 --> 03:58:46.545
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH FAIR

03:58:46.612 --> 03:58:48.714
AT THE BEGINNING. TO SAY WE'RE

03:58:48.781 --> 03:58:49.648
GONNA CALL HIGH WE'RE GONNA

03:58:49.715 --> 03:58:52.685
WE'RE GONNA COUNT HYDRO AND

03:58:52.751 --> 03:58:53.852
LET'S MAKE THE STANDARD FIRE.

03:58:53.919 --> 03:58:54.687
BECAUSE THEN YOU THEN THEY COULD

03:58:54.753 --> 03:58:56.288
HAVE GOTTEN CREDIT FOR THEIR OWN

03:58:56.355 --> 03:58:58.390
ENERGY AND BUT THEY HAD TO MEET

03:58:58.457 --> 03:59:00.392
HIGHER HIGHER -- TARGETS DOWN

03:59:00.459 --> 03:59:01.260
THE ROAD.

03:59:01.326 --> 03:59:02.861
THEY MADE THE INVESTMENTS NOW

03:59:02.928 --> 03:59:04.596
AND THE RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING

03:59:04.663 --> 03:59:06.398
FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO GET CHEAPER --

03:59:06.465 --> 03:59:08.534
SOLAR ENERGY -- AND THEY'RE NOT

03:59:08.600 --> 03:59:09.835
ASKING TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK

03:59:09.902 --> 03:59:11.970
THEY'RE JUST ASKING FOR THAT THE

03:59:12.037 --> 03:59:14.273
EQUITY THAT -- WILL ALLOW THEM

03:59:14.339 --> 03:59:16.075
TO TELL THE REPAIRS WE CAN TAKE

03:59:16.141 --> 03:59:17.943
A DEEP BREATH FOR FOR A MINUTE --

03:59:18.010 --> 03:59:18.811
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO

03:59:18.877 --> 03:59:19.845
MAKE THESE THESE HUGE

03:59:19.912 --> 03:59:20.913
INVESTMENTS THAT THAT DON'T

03:59:20.979 --> 03:59:23.115
BENEFIT US WE ARE NOT USING THAT

03:59:23.182 --> 03:59:24.316
ENERGY.

03:59:24.383 --> 03:59:27.352
NUMBER ONE IT AND THEN NOT THAT

03:59:27.419 --> 03:59:27.953
FINALLY THEY'RE NOT ASKING. TO

03:59:28.020 --> 03:59:29.154
SELL OFF.

03:59:29.221 --> 03:59:30.189
THE ENERGY THAT THEY PRODUCE

03:59:30.255 --> 03:59:31.990
FROM HYDRO IF IT ALL GOES TO THE

03:59:32.057 --> 03:59:33.025
RATE PAYERS.

03:59:33.092 --> 03:59:34.727
IT IS THAT THEY'RE NOT IN AND WE

03:59:34.793 --> 03:59:36.462
AGREED TO THAT AS AS AN

03:59:36.528 --> 03:59:37.629
AMENDMENT AS WELL.

03:59:37.696 --> 03:59:39.832
SO I'M IMMEDIATE INTO IN TERMS

03:59:39.898 --> 03:59:43.469
OF OF OF IS THIS A RENEWABLE

03:59:43.535 --> 03:59:46.105
ENERGY AND IS IT NOT A CLEAN

03:59:46.171 --> 03:59:47.439
ENERGY I'M IT'S IT'S MIND

03:59:47.506 --> 03:59:48.874
BOGGLING TO ME THAT ANYBODY

03:59:48.941 --> 03:59:51.276
WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S THAT NOT

03:59:51.343 --> 03:59:54.513
RENEWABLE AND THEN IT'S NOT --

03:59:54.580 --> 03:59:55.481
IT'S IT'S NOT [inaudible]

03:59:55.547 --> 03:59:56.882
CARBON FREE.

03:59:56.949 --> 03:59:57.850
IT IS.

03:59:57.916 --> 04:00:00.319
AND SO ON WE JUST IF IT'S A

04:00:00.385 --> 04:00:01.553
FAIRNESS ISSUE IT'S AN EQUITY

04:00:01.620 --> 04:00:03.455
ISSUE AND QUITE FRANKLY IT IT IS

04:00:03.522 --> 04:00:05.758
A REPAIR HUGH.

04:00:05.824 --> 04:00:06.892
ON THE EQUITY STANDPOINT YOU'RE

04:00:06.959 --> 04:00:07.493
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING

04:00:07.559 --> 04:00:10.496
FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

04:00:10.562 --> 04:00:12.631
BUT IT YEAH I'M KIND OF A NOTE.

04:00:12.698 --> 04:00:15.634
PERSON SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHY.

04:00:15.701 --> 04:00:17.302
PERHAPS YOU AND SENATOR BRADFORD

04:00:17.369 --> 04:00:18.504
DIDN'T DO A BILL THAT SAID THAT

04:00:18.570 --> 04:00:20.005
HYDRO PRICE.

04:00:20.072 --> 04:00:22.107
EVERYBODY EVERYBODY SO THAT WE

04:00:22.174 --> 04:00:22.875
DON'T HAVE THIS [inaudible]

04:00:22.941 --> 04:00:30.883
DEBATE.

04:00:30.949 --> 04:00:32.351
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHEN I WAS

04:00:32.417 --> 04:00:34.119
TRYING TO DO IS TO HELP THE RATE

04:00:34.186 --> 04:00:35.420
PAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN --

04:00:35.487 --> 04:00:37.823
BURDENED AND AND IN PARTICULAR

04:00:37.890 --> 04:00:39.958
IN IN IN A REGION WHERE I'M VERY

04:00:40.025 --> 04:00:42.528
LUCKY IN -- IN IN THE COASTAL

04:00:42.594 --> 04:00:43.395
REGION.

04:00:43.462 --> 04:00:44.830
WE DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING

04:00:44.897 --> 04:00:46.899
CONDITIONERS IN OUR HOUSE AND IN

04:00:46.965 --> 04:00:48.901
IN IN THE WINTER AND SUMMER IT'S

04:00:48.967 --> 04:00:50.435
SIXTY DEGREES ALL YEAR ROUND SO

04:00:50.502 --> 04:00:52.037
I'M ALWAYS IN THE FIRST YEAR IN

04:00:52.104 --> 04:00:52.671
TERMS OF PAYING MY ELECTRIC

04:00:52.738 --> 04:00:53.605
BILLS.

04:00:53.672 --> 04:00:55.274
BUT I'VE ALSO SPENT TIME IN THE

04:00:55.340 --> 04:00:56.575
CENTRAL VALLEY YOU BETTER HAVE

04:00:56.642 --> 04:00:58.443
AN AIR CONDITIONER AND YOU

04:00:58.510 --> 04:00:59.111
BETTER HAVE A REALLY GOOD HEATER

04:00:59.178 --> 04:01:00.279
IN THE WINTER.

04:01:00.345 --> 04:01:02.915
AND SO -- I HAD A LEGISLATOR

04:01:02.981 --> 04:01:04.483
TELL ME LAST YEAR THAT THAT

04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:05.484
LIVES FULL TIME IN THE CENTRAL

04:01:05.551 --> 04:01:05.918
VALLEY.

04:01:05.984 --> 04:01:08.320
THAT HIS ELECTRIC BILL WAS SIX

04:01:08.387 --> 04:01:09.855
HUNDRED BUCKS ONE ONE OF THE

04:01:09.922 --> 04:01:11.523
MONTHS BECAUSE HE HAD LITTLE

04:01:11.590 --> 04:01:12.591
KIDS AT HOME.

04:01:12.658 --> 04:01:14.426
AND AND THEY NEEDED THE AIR

04:01:14.493 --> 04:01:16.195
CONDITIONER ON AND I I WAS

04:01:16.261 --> 04:01:17.729
APPALLED AT THE IDEA THAT YOU

04:01:17.796 --> 04:01:19.698
HAVE TO PAY THAT THAT MUCH AND

04:01:19.765 --> 04:01:20.399
AND THAT'S WHAT.

04:01:20.465 --> 04:01:22.167
THAT'S REALLY WHAT EXEMPLIFIED

04:01:22.234 --> 04:01:23.902
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH SHE SAID

04:01:23.969 --> 04:01:24.403
IT IT.

04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:25.270
IT IT.

04:01:25.337 --> 04:01:29.408
IN IN IN A REGION WHERE THE

04:01:29.474 --> 04:01:31.543
WHERE WHAT YOU USE TENDS TO BE

04:01:31.610 --> 04:01:33.145
HIGHER IN THAT IN THAT REGARD

04:01:33.212 --> 04:01:34.012
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS TO HAVE A

04:01:34.079 --> 04:01:35.614
HIGHER RATE BECAUSE YOU YOU'RE

04:01:35.681 --> 04:01:37.216
TRYING TO MEET SOME --

04:01:37.282 --> 04:01:39.418
OBLIGATION THAT'S BEEN SET THAT

04:01:39.484 --> 04:01:40.352
REALLY DOESN'T BENEFIT YOUR

04:01:40.419 --> 04:01:41.954
RESIDENTS AT ALL.

04:01:42.020 --> 04:01:43.455
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO

04:01:43.522 --> 04:01:44.790
DO THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE MAJOR

04:01:44.857 --> 04:01:46.291
INVESTMENTS AND SO.

04:01:46.358 --> 04:01:48.327
YOU KNOW MAYBE WE I UNDERSTOOD

04:01:48.393 --> 04:01:50.562
THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF THESE TWO

04:01:50.629 --> 04:01:51.597
IRRIGATION DISTRICT DISTRICT

04:01:51.663 --> 04:01:52.931
BECAUSE I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

04:01:52.998 --> 04:01:54.032
TALKING TO THEM IN TRYING TO

04:01:54.099 --> 04:01:55.667
UNDERSTAND HOW HOW THE PROCESS

04:01:55.734 --> 04:01:56.268
WORKS.

04:01:56.335 --> 04:01:57.703
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS IN

04:01:57.769 --> 04:01:59.204
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE -- BUT

04:01:59.271 --> 04:02:01.406
I'VE I FIGURED IF I COULD HELP

04:02:01.473 --> 04:02:07.312
SOLVE IT HERE -- WE CAN SEE

04:02:07.379 --> 04:02:08.447
LATER ON WHAT.

04:02:08.513 --> 04:02:09.081
CAN'T PREDICT WHAT WHAT WOULD

04:02:09.147 --> 04:02:10.115
HAPPEN LATER ON I DON'T KNOW

04:02:10.182 --> 04:02:11.216
WHERE THE OTHER HYDRO IS LOCATED

04:02:11.283 --> 04:02:11.717
IN AND WHAT IT.

04:02:11.783 --> 04:02:13.285
IMPACT IS QUITE FRANKLY.

04:02:13.352 --> 04:02:14.353
I DON'T EITHER THAT'S WHY I WAS

04:02:14.419 --> 04:02:15.587
KIND OF ASKING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

04:02:15.654 --> 04:02:18.056
WANNA STAY RIGID TO A PRINCIPLE.

04:02:18.123 --> 04:02:21.660
THE RBS TOLD THAT.

04:02:21.727 --> 04:02:22.794
THAT THAT MAKES NOW.

04:02:22.861 --> 04:02:24.096
EXEMPTIONS AND THAT'S WHERE THE

04:02:24.162 --> 04:02:26.098
STRUGGLE IS I'M JUST CURIOUS IN

04:02:26.164 --> 04:02:27.933
THIS YEAR VALLEY THEN ARE.

04:02:28.000 --> 04:02:28.600
SINCE YOU'RE PAYING HIGHER RATES

04:02:28.667 --> 04:02:32.137
PERHAPS WE SUBSIDIZE THAT WITH.

04:02:32.204 --> 04:02:33.171
I'M SORRY GO AHEAD YOU YOUR

04:02:33.238 --> 04:02:35.007
LOCAL STORE.

04:02:35.073 --> 04:02:36.208
DO NOT AGREE ARE ARE THE ARE ARE

04:02:36.275 --> 04:02:37.576
YOUR REPAIRS TO THE RATES THE

04:02:37.643 --> 04:02:39.211
RATES ARE HIGHER IT'S THE USAGE

04:02:39.278 --> 04:02:40.279
THAT SO MUCH HIGHER THAT CAUSES

04:02:40.345 --> 04:02:41.880
THE HIGHER BILLS IN YOUR

04:02:41.947 --> 04:02:42.447
SUBSIDIZING THAT [inaudible]

04:02:42.514 --> 04:02:44.249
THROUGH.

04:02:44.316 --> 04:02:45.918
WHAT THE RESERVES ARE HIGH I YOU?

04:02:45.984 --> 04:02:47.319
OR YOU ARE JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE

04:02:47.386 --> 04:02:49.187
THE HYDRO YOU CAN AFFORD.

04:02:49.254 --> 04:02:50.355
TO CHARGE RATES THAT ARE LOWER

04:02:50.422 --> 04:02:51.423
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE PAYING HIGHER

04:02:51.490 --> 04:02:53.659
RATES FOR THE SOUL.

04:02:53.725 --> 04:02:54.993
I THINK OUR OUR RATES ARE LOWER

04:02:55.060 --> 04:02:55.928
BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSE

04:02:55.994 --> 04:02:57.829
PORTFOLIOS THAT WE BOTH HALF AND

04:02:57.896 --> 04:02:59.364
AND THE THE ACTIONS THAT WE'VE

04:02:59.431 --> 04:03:00.832
TAKEN OVER THE YEARS TO TRY TO

04:03:00.899 --> 04:03:02.000
KEEP OUR RATES LOW BECAUSE WE

04:03:02.067 --> 04:03:05.203
ARE APPEAR YOU -- SO IT IS FAR

04:03:05.270 --> 04:03:06.939
SUBSIDIZING I DON'T THERE'S NO

04:03:07.005 --> 04:03:08.507
THERE'S NO FORMA SUBSIDY

04:03:08.573 --> 04:03:09.374
ALTHOUGH ALL THE REVENUE WE GET

04:03:09.441 --> 04:03:11.944
GOES BACK GOES BACK TO THE RATE

04:03:12.010 --> 04:03:12.544
THE RATE PAYERS AREN'T FEELING

04:03:12.611 --> 04:03:13.745
ANY PAIN.

04:03:13.812 --> 04:03:14.913
THE REPAIRS ARE THE ONES WHO WHO

04:03:14.980 --> 04:03:17.249
MUST HAVE A HIGH VOLUME.

04:03:17.316 --> 04:03:18.884
AND IN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY YES

04:03:18.951 --> 04:03:20.519
MOST FOLKS WOULD HAVE HIGHER

04:03:20.585 --> 04:03:22.754
VOLUMES AND THEN FOLKS ELSEWHERE

IN THE STATE LIKE LIKE ON THE

04:03:23.956 --> 04:03:25.157
COASTAL REGIONS AND STUFF SO SO

04:03:25.223 --> 04:03:26.291
THAT'S WHAT CAUSES THE HIGHER

04:03:26.358 --> 04:03:27.726
BILLS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THE

04:03:27.793 --> 04:03:29.061

GENERATORS OF THE WORLD KERN

04:04:54.546 --> 04:04:56.148

04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:26.364
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN AND FOR

04:07:26.431 --> 04:07:29.434
THAT REASON -- I DIDN'T SUPPORT

04:07:29.501 --> 04:07:32.137
IT BUT BUT THESE BOTH OF THESE

04:07:32.204 --> 04:07:33.872
IRRIGATION DISTRICT.

04:07:33.939 --> 04:07:35.640
HAVE STEPPED UP.

04:07:35.707 --> 04:07:37.576
AND THEY'VE MADE VERY EXPENSIVE

04:07:37.642 --> 04:07:39.277
MULTI MILLION DOLLAR PURCHASES

04:07:39.344 --> 04:07:41.813
OF SOLAR.

04:07:41.880 --> 04:07:43.748
IT'S NOT ENERGY THEY NEED FOR

04:07:43.815 --> 04:07:45.550
THEIR RATE PAYERS.

04:07:45.617 --> 04:07:47.352
IT IS ENERGY THAT THEY HAVE TO

04:07:47.419 --> 04:07:50.522
BUY BECAUSE OF THAT REQUIREMENTS.

04:07:50.589 --> 04:07:52.023
AND THEN THEY HAVE THEY SELL IT

04:07:52.090 --> 04:07:54.159
OFF IS AT A DISCOUNT.

04:07:54.226 --> 04:07:56.127
AND SO THE RATE PAYERS ARE

04:07:56.194 --> 04:07:57.862
PAYING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

04:07:57.929 --> 04:08:00.098
THIS INVESTMENT AND THEN HAVING

04:08:00.165 --> 04:08:02.334
THE ENERGY SOLD OFF.

04:08:02.400 --> 04:08:04.269
AND AND AND AND AND THE WHOLE

04:08:04.336 --> 04:08:06.438
POINT OF IT IS IS THAT IT IT WAS

04:08:06.504 --> 04:08:08.573
A SYSTEM.

04:08:08.640 --> 04:08:10.575
THAT WAS NOT SET UP THERE IN THE

04:08:10.642 --> 04:08:11.977
FIRST PLACE FROM FROM MY

04:08:12.043 --> 04:08:13.778
PERSPECTIVE.

04:08:13.845 --> 04:08:16.348
AND SO NOW TO SAY WELL YOU BUTTE

04:08:16.414 --> 04:08:18.083
YOU'RE GONNA UNFAIRLY CHANGE THE

04:08:18.149 --> 04:08:19.217
SYSTEM.

04:08:19.284 --> 04:08:20.785
IT JUST DOESN'T WASH WITH ME

04:08:20.852 --> 04:08:22.721
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM.

04:08:22.787 --> 04:08:24.122
IT WAS A SYSTEM THAT

04:08:24.189 --> 04:08:27.759
SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED HYDRO FOR

04:08:27.826 --> 04:08:29.527
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

04:08:29.594 --> 04:08:32.364
AND THAT PURPOSE WAS TO GET OFF.

04:08:32.430 --> 04:08:33.632
THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS

04:08:33.698 --> 04:08:33.932
[inaudible]

04:08:33.999 --> 04:08:35.433
SO.

04:08:35.500 --> 04:08:37.302
NO I'M NOT I AND I APPRECIATE

04:08:37.369 --> 04:08:38.737
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.

04:08:38.803 --> 04:08:40.972
YEAH CENTER SENATOR IS TRY TO

04:08:41.039 --> 04:08:41.806
BREATH [inaudible]

04:08:41.873 --> 04:08:43.942
I'M.

04:08:44.009 --> 04:08:45.810
WE ALL COULD HAVE RESTORATIONS

04:08:45.877 --> 04:08:47.345
ANY EXPRESSED SOME WITH THE

04:08:47.412 --> 04:08:47.879
ORIGINAL BILL BUT I THINK

04:08:47.946 --> 04:08:52.584
[inaudible] TO TO DEFINE IT AS

04:08:52.651 --> 04:08:55.320
THE EXCLUSION OF THAT THE LARGE.

04:08:55.387 --> 04:08:57.856
BLUE XIN WAS PARTICULARLY

04:08:57.922 --> 04:09:00.025
DETRIMENTAL TO RURAL AREAS I

04:09:00.091 --> 04:09:01.059
MEAN.

04:09:01.126 --> 04:09:04.162
LED W. P..

04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:05.330
AT THE POINT THAT THE ARK YES

04:09:05.397 --> 04:09:05.764
WAS ADOPTED.

04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:09.134
HAD OVER 25% OF ITS POWER MIX IN

04:09:09.200 --> 04:09:11.002
LARGE RIGHT.

04:09:11.069 --> 04:09:13.171
IT SHIP IT NOW JUST IS

04:09:13.238 --> 04:09:15.573
PURCHASING.

04:09:15.640 --> 04:09:18.109
JEANNIE AS A 20% MORE TRIED

04:09:18.176 --> 04:09:19.010
GROWN IT'S MIXED.

04:09:19.077 --> 04:09:19.711
THE SFPUC.

04:09:19.778 --> 04:09:22.147
HAS A THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

04:09:22.213 --> 04:09:24.215
FIVE MEGAWATTS OF LARGE HYDRO IN

04:09:24.282 --> 04:09:25.884
ITS ELECTRICITY MIX.

04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:27.819
ONLY THIRTEEN MEG WHAT EVERY

04:09:27.886 --> 04:09:31.056
NOTE SO IT'S JUST NOT.

04:09:31.122 --> 04:09:33.692
ACCURATE TO PUT IT THAT WAY.

04:09:33.758 --> 04:09:35.560
AND I'M.

04:09:35.627 --> 04:09:35.794
I THINK.

04:09:35.860 --> 04:09:36.728
YOU KNOW THE OBJECTION THAT AT

04:09:36.795 --> 04:09:39.097
LEAST I HAVE MUCH MORE THAT WE

04:09:39.164 --> 04:09:40.532
BUILT IN.

04:09:40.598 --> 04:09:43.501
BE A COST COMPLIANCE MEANING TO

04:09:43.568 --> 04:09:47.806
BE A COST LIMITATION COMPLIANCE

04:09:47.872 --> 04:09:50.041
TO PROTECT PO USE AND THE

04:09:50.108 --> 04:09:53.078
DISTRICTS AB EXERCISES THAT.

04:09:53.144 --> 04:09:55.180
AND SO IT JUST AGAIN FOR ME IT'S

04:09:55.246 --> 04:09:56.481
HARD TO SEE WHAT WE NEED IS

04:09:56.548 --> 04:09:59.050
RIGHT NOW.

04:09:59.117 --> 04:10:01.486
CENTER BRAD YEAH I I WANNA GO

04:10:01.553 --> 04:10:02.754
WOULD SOONER STERN STATED THAT

04:10:02.821 --> 04:10:04.456
WE'RE CLEARLY ONE CALIFORNIA

04:10:04.522 --> 04:10:04.756
[inaudible]

04:10:04.823 --> 04:10:08.393
BUT IT'S MANY PARTS OF

04:10:08.460 --> 04:10:09.994
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM

04:10:10.061 --> 04:10:11.696
THE DISCUSSION.

04:10:11.763 --> 04:10:14.599
OF ENERGY AND VARIOUS POLICIES

04:10:14.666 --> 04:10:16.267
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

04:10:16.334 --> 04:10:17.168
AND IN NEED IN KERN COUNTY

04:10:17.235 --> 04:10:18.737
AREN'T CENTRAL VALLEY IS FAR

04:10:18.803 --> 04:10:20.338
DIFFERENT FROM LOS ANGELES.

04:10:20.405 --> 04:10:22.374
BUT AT THE SAME TIME.

04:10:22.440 --> 04:10:24.075
THE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE THAT

04:10:24.142 --> 04:10:25.076
NOW.

04:10:25.143 --> 04:10:27.145
UTILITIES WILL INVESTOR OWNED

04:10:27.212 --> 04:10:29.314
UTILITIES WILL GO BACK SOON HI I

04:10:29.381 --> 04:10:30.849
MEAN I USING A HYDRO.

04:10:30.915 --> 04:10:31.716
THEY SOLD OFF THEIR PART POWER

04:10:31.783 --> 04:10:33.818
PLANTS BECAUSE OF DEREGULATION

04:10:33.885 --> 04:10:35.286
SO.

04:10:35.353 --> 04:10:36.121
THEY'RE STILL THERE BUT THEY

04:10:36.187 --> 04:10:37.789
DON'T ONLY MORE SO THEY WOULD

04:10:37.856 --> 04:10:38.890
STILL HAVE TO GO OUT AND

04:10:38.957 --> 04:10:40.225
PURCHASE ARE FROM WHATEVER BUT

04:10:40.291 --> 04:10:41.760
THIS IS A REVIEW OF ONE TO

04:10:41.826 --> 04:10:44.162
CONTINUE TO FRAME HYDRO AS IF

04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:46.030
IT'S NOT RENEWAL.

04:10:46.097 --> 04:10:47.298
WE SEE IT WORKING IN BRITISH

04:10:47.365 --> 04:10:49.000
COLUMBIA WE SEE IT WORKING WE

04:10:49.067 --> 04:10:51.035
HAD TRIED TO DO A DEAL WERE

04:10:51.102 --> 04:10:52.170
RUNNING THE RIVER IN BC.

04:10:52.237 --> 04:10:53.805
THE BRING IMPORTS ALL KNOW YOU

04:10:53.872 --> 04:10:54.906
CAN'T BECAUSE THE BUCKET ONE

04:10:54.973 --> 04:10:56.541
BUCKET TWO BUCKETS.

04:10:56.608 --> 04:10:58.109
IT ALL HAS TO BE IN STATE.

04:10:58.176 --> 04:11:00.812
WE COULD HAVE HAD CHEAPER POWER

04:11:00.879 --> 04:11:01.846
FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO IF WE

04:11:01.913 --> 04:11:03.882
WERE OPEN.

04:11:03.948 --> 04:11:04.649
TO ALL THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES

04:11:04.716 --> 04:11:05.316
OUT.

04:11:05.383 --> 04:11:06.818
ARE AVAILABLE YOU'RE HEARING A

04:11:06.885 --> 04:11:09.554
COMMUNITY THAT IS NOW BUYING.

04:11:09.621 --> 04:11:12.056
SOLAR BECAUSE IT'S MANDATE IT

04:11:12.123 --> 04:11:13.691
BUT SHE ADDING OUT THE LOWER

04:11:13.758 --> 04:11:16.494
WOULD BECAUSE IT'S ON NECESSARY.

04:11:16.561 --> 04:11:18.496
THAT IS HUSTLING BACKWARDS TO ME

04:11:18.563 --> 04:11:20.231
AND THAT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO

04:11:20.298 --> 04:11:21.433
SENSE SO IT'S NOT.

04:11:21.499 --> 04:11:22.534
ENERGY RATE THAT THEY'RE

04:11:22.600 --> 04:11:23.601
CONCERNED ABOUT IT STEM

04:11:23.668 --> 04:11:25.570
CONSUMPTION BECAUSE THEY USE

04:11:25.637 --> 04:11:27.972
MORE ASH OUT THE SENATOR STATED

04:11:28.039 --> 04:11:29.774
IN THE WINTER AND THE SUMMER AND

04:11:29.841 --> 04:11:30.708
WE DO.

04:11:30.775 --> 04:11:32.844
AND COAST TORN URBAN AREAS SO

04:11:32.911 --> 04:11:34.078
THAT'S TO RULE SHOULD NOT WHAT

04:11:34.145 --> 04:11:38.750
THE PAPER BUT HOW MUCH THEY HAVE

04:11:38.817 --> 04:11:39.584
TO USE SO.

04:11:39.651 --> 04:11:40.718
ALLOWING HIM TO NOT HAVE TO MAKE

04:11:40.785 --> 04:11:41.719
THOSE UNNECESSARILY UNNECESSARY

04:11:41.786 --> 04:11:43.688
PURCHASES OF SOLAR OUR

04:11:43.755 --> 04:11:45.557
INVESTMENT IN SOLAR ONLY THE SHE

04:11:45.623 --> 04:11:46.624
HAD A PART IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

04:11:46.691 --> 04:11:48.126
DAY.

04:11:48.193 --> 04:11:49.594
THAT'S THE WHOLE DOCTOR VOTE.

04:11:49.661 --> 04:11:51.696
SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT IN

04:11:51.763 --> 04:11:53.631
YOUR HER SHE HAS A SOLUTION TRY

04:11:53.698 --> 04:11:55.733
TO HELP US FIX TO DUB URBAN WE
