THIS BILL ALSO ENJOYS HIS SUPPORT SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON TO ALL OF YOU A RECENT COURT CASE CAL NO GARDENS VERSUS CITY OF LOS ANGELES. HAS UNDERMINED THE APPLICATION OF MELLOW AND DENSITY BONUS LAW IN THE COASTAL ZONE. IN THAT CASE A DEVELOPER PROPOSED A SMALL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE VENICE AREA OF LOS ANGELES THAT INCLUDED AFFORDABLE UNITS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MELLOW ACT. AND A DENSITY BONUS UNDER STATE LAW AND ALTHOUGH THE PROJECT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE BOTH THE LOCAL PLANNING AND ZONING AND THE DENSITY BONUS LAW. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DENIED THE PROJECT ON THE BASIS THAT THE INCREASED DENSITY. MADE THE PROJECT VISUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD IN VIOLATION OF THE COASTAL ACT. THE APPELLATE COURT UPHELD THE DENIAL FINDING THAT THE COASTAL ACCENT SUPERSEDES DENSITY BONUS LAW. AND IF NOT CORRECTED THIS DECISION WILL LIKELY PREVENT DENSITY BONUS LAW FROM BEING USED AND THE COASTAL ZONE. AND WILL UNDERMINE THE PRESERVATION OF PRODUCTION OF HOUSING AND THE MELLOW ACT THE RESULT WILL BE FEWER AFFORDABLE UNITS WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE. A RESULT THAT WE CAN SCARCELY. A ALLOW IT THIS TIME SO AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN WILL CLARIFY A PARTISAN IN THE DENSITY BONUS LAW. TO ENSURE THAT A PROJECT COULD NOT BE FOUND INCONSISTENT WITH THE COASTAL ACT MERELY BECAUSE IT RECEIVES A DENSITY INCREASE UNDER STATE LAW. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE WORKED OUT ALL OF OUR CONCERNS WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND OTHER OPPOSITION. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR HER ARRIVAL.
