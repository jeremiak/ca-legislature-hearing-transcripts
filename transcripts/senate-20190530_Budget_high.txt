COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET. WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO ONCE AGAIN DOING SOME OF THAT CENTER NIELSEN SAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK. THAT COMES BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE TO AGREE WITH HIM -- AND WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS COME WILL COMPLETE AGAIN ON DEALS WITH THE UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR WHICH BEGINS JULY. ONE AS YOU ALL ARE WELL AWARE PAINFULLY AWARE AS WE ARE WE HAVE A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO COMPLETE THIS WORK. IDEALLY WE'D LIKE TO CLOSE DOWN BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK. AND SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO A TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT DEDICATES AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR A THOROUGH VETTING OF THE ISSUES. CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ENTAILS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK WITHIN A TIGHT TIME FRAME AND I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUES FROM BOTH HOUSES BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. FOR THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU'VE MADE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS IN TODAY'S HEARING WILL BEGIN WITH A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW PROVIDED BY THE LA -- OF EACH HOUSES BUDGET FRAMEWORK AS COMPARED TO THAT OF THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW -- THAT WE'RE REALLY NOT THAT FAR APART IN OUR RESPECTIVE VERSES OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET WE'VE ADOPTED SIMILAR REVENUE ESTIMATES AND I PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN SIMILAR AREAS. EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE COMBAT IN THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND CONTINUING TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMS. THAT FRANKLY WE'RE STILL TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP ON FROM THE LAST RECESSION. IN ADDITION ALL THREE ENTITIES THE ASSEMBLY SEVENTY MINISTRATION CONTINUE THE RESPONSIBLE BUDGET PRACTICES OF BUILDING RESERVES AT ADDRESSING DEBTS AND LIABILITIES. AFTER THE OVERVIEW. ENTITY OPENING COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL BEGIN WORK WILL BEGIN TO WORK THROUGH THE EDUCATION SECTION OF THE AGENDA. THE PLAN IS TO MAKE IT AS FAR FOR THE EDUCATION SECTION AS WE CAN'T TODAY AND WILL RESUME TOMORROW AT TEN AM [inaudible] WITH THAT. MISTER VICE CHAIR DO YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST VERY BRIEFLY I THINK IT'S ON A GREAT TO BE A CONFERENCE AGAIN WITH ALL THE FAMILIAR FACES I THINK THIS IS OUR OUR VERY EXCITING TIME OF YEAR WHERE WE GET. TO PRESENT THE CULMINATION OF THE MONTHS OF HEARINGS THE SENATE HAS HAD AS WELL AS THE MONTHS OF HEARING THAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS HAD. I KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT OF CONSTERNATION AS WE GO INTO THE FINAL -- SETTLEMENT OF THE VARIOUS DIFFERENCES THE BAT WHEN I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO POINT OUT IS THAT 99% OF THE BUDGET HAS BEEN DONE. IT'S BEEN DONE THROUGH NUMEROUS SUBCOMMITTEES THROUGH HOURS OF TESTIMONY THROUGH -- THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OF PUBLIC COMMENT REALLY COMING FORWARD TO THIS CAPITAL. T SHARE THEIR VIEW POINT OF WHAT THEY BELIEVE WHO ARE STATE SHOULD BE SPENDING ON I THINK THIS. THIS BUDGET THE ALL THREE PROPOSALS. SO WE'VE ALREADY AGREE ON REALLY REFLECT THE SHARED IN PUTTING THE SHARED VALUES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT ALSO MORE POORLY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO CON. IN GIVING US FEEDBACK AS TO WHAT PROGRAMS THAT WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN -- REALLY WHAT WOULD REALLY IMPROVE THEIR LIFE WHICH IS ULTIMATELY WHAT THE GOAL OF THE BUDGET IS TO DO IS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO SERVE AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE TO BE VICE CHAIR OF THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- BUT AGAIN MORE POLICE TO TO REMIND US THAT WE WILL WE'VE ALREADY AGREED ON HIM NINETY PLUS PERCENT OF THE BUDGET. WE'RE REALLY THIS PART IS THE PROCESS WHERE WE ARE JUST GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES AND AGAIN -- BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE WE ACTUALLY HAVE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCES. IN WITH THE GOVERNOR WE HAVE A FEW DIFFERENCES BUT NOT AS MANY AS WE ARE WE WOULD ANTICIPATE. SO AGAIN -- LOOKING FOR TWO VERY ROBUST HEARING I THINK A VERY VERY TO LIBERTY HEARING AND EXCITED AGAIN TO GET STARTED. H. YOU VERY MUCH -- SITTING I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR PARTNERSHIP ONCE AGAIN BUT THIS IS OUR THIRTY THIRD YEAR I APPRECIATE THAT PARTNERSHIP. WITH THAT BEFORE WE GET STARTED WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CENTERS MITCHELL HERE WARLOCK NIELSEN. ROTH YOUR SKINNER HERE. ASSEMBLYMEMBERS TING. MAYES [inaudible] MCCARTY [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] WEBER [inaudible] HERE. WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INVITE -- ARE LESS ALICE MISTER PADDICK [inaudible] AND MISTER. THIS WILL NOTHING TO JOIN US -- SERVICE WOULD OFTEN YOU KNOW THEIR APPEAR TEASING ME ABOUT YOU KNOW MY STRUGGLE WITH YOUR NAME BUT I LANDED IT TODAY DID NOT. YOU THAT SENATOR ALL. THANK YOU YES I GOT MISTER PETTIT CRIED AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME YES. WELL -- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I FORWARD TO MY PARTICIPATION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. I HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A COPY OF THIS OVERVIEW HANDOUT. IN YOUR IN YOUR BINDERS OR OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO YOU THERE. I WAS PLANNING TO WALK THROUGH THE THE HAND OUT HERE. BRIEFLY. BUT FIRST I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OUR ANALYSTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE PRIMARILY TO INTRODUCE THE VARIOUS ISSUES YOU'LL BE TAKING UP. HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PLANS AND THEN IN SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THE CASES BUT IN CASES WHERE THEY HAVE. AN ANALYTIC BASIS FOR DOING SO THEY WILL MAKE -- RECOMMENDATIONS THE NEO FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION [inaudible] SO. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO DO BEFORE LAUNCHING INTO THE SLIDES IS JUST -- PAS. TO ACKNOWLEDGE REALLY THE VERY STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE STATE AT THIS TIME -- THE STATE IS IN A VERY HEALTHY FISCAL POSITION -- WITH -- YOU KNOW BENEFITING FROM THE CULMINATION OF SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROW OF UPWARD REVENUE REVISIONS. AND THAT'S VERY FAVORABLE HOWEVER IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE KIND OF SITUATION THAT IS LIKELY TO BE RECURRING ON  ONGOING BASIS INTOTHE FUTURE. AND THEREFORE. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE THINK ABOUT THIS AS SOMEWHAT OF A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE PREPARING THE STATE FOR THE FUTURE -- PREPARING THE STATE TO ACCOMMODATE UNANTICIPATED COSTS THAT CAN ARISE. BOTH FROM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS BUT ALSO NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER KIND OF EENTS. AND CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT THERE IS LIKELY TO BE ANOTHER RECESSION IN THE FUTURE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO PREDICT EXACTLY WHEN BUT NO MOST MOST EVERYONE AGREES THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER RECESSION SO. WITH THAT LET ME TURN TO THE FIRST PAGE AND HERE. I WOULD ACTUALLY ECHO SENATOR MITCHELL'S -- OPENING COMMENTS IN THAT. THIS SLIDE COMPARES THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION UNDER THE THREE DIFFERENT PLANS AND WHAT YOU WOULD FIND WHAT WE WHAT THE YOU KNOW THE POINT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE HERE IS JUST THAT. LOOKING AT ALL THREE PLANS YOU SEE VERY SIMILAR GENERAL FUND CONDITION AT THAT THE HIGH LEVEL AT LEAST. THIS REFLECTS THE ALL THREE PLANS ADOPTED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REVENUE ESTIMATES. AND ALL THREE PLANS HAVE ADOPTED THE SAME LEVEL OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AND SO WITH THOSE TWO VARIABLES IN SYNC. IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT AT LEAST AT A HIGH LEVEL THE BUDGET CONDITION LOOKS VERY SIMILAR. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES -- STEM FROM FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHOICES THAT DIFFER AMONG THE THREE DIFFERENT -- PLANS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S REVENUES. THERE ARE HIGHER REVENUES. AND THEN THE OTHER THAN THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PLANS AND THAT. PRIMARILY REFLECTS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. ASSUMES SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM THE ADOPTION OF TAX CONFORMITY MEASURES CONFORMING THE STATE TAX CODE WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CODE. AND THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PLANS -- DO NOT MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION UP FRONT. THE HOWEVER THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PLANTS GENERATE A SIMILAR LEVEL OF ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND CAPACITY MORE ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE BY ASSUMING AN EXTENSION OF THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX PACKAGE THEM CO TAX THAT IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN THE OTHER. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON THIS PAGE THAT I WOULD JUST TRY YOUR ATTENTION TO IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY ENDS WITH A NEARLY THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION. A SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES RESERVE BALANCE -- WHICH IS MATERIALLY HIGHER THAN THE OTHER TWO PLANS ON THE PAGE. SO MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE I THINK THAT KIND OF LEADS ME INTO THE DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT TOTAL COMPARING TOTAL RESERVE BALANCES. AND THE WHEN YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK I CAN SAY THAT ALL THREE PLANS HAVE FROM CANNABIS HISTORIC STANDPOINT ALL THREE PLAN SHOW VERY HIGH TOTAL RESERVES AT THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. SO THAT SAYS THERE'S IN BROAD TERMS THERE'S AGREEMENT ABOUT THAT. ALL THREE PLANS INCLUDE A SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. A WITH THE SENATE ACTUALLY PUTTING AN ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED MILLION INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH BRINGS ITS BALANCE HIGHER THAN THE OTHER TWO TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AS I WAS JUST SAYING A MOMENT AGO THE SFE YOU BALANCE IS NOTABLY HIGHER THAN THE OTHER TWO PLANS A THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION. THAT PROVIDES THE STATE WITH SOME. YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL FISCAL FLEXIBILITY TO CERTAINLY COVER -- ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S A TO SERVE A FLEXIBLE -- RESERVE OTHER TYPES OF UNANTICIPATED COSTS THAT COULD ARISE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO JUST MENTION ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY RESERVES. IS THAT IT'S THE ONE FIGURE HERE THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL RESERVE BALANCE INTO THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE OF TWENTY TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT OUR OFFICE HAS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED. WOULD BE THE AMOUNT NECESSARY FOR THE STATE TO WITHSTAND. THE FFECTS OF A A RECESSION THE MILD OR MODERATE RECESSION WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIONS LIKE TAX INCREASES OR SPENDING REDUCTIONS WERE -- YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF COST SHIFT MOOD MANEUVER. SO THE ASSEMBLY PLANT IS NOTABLE FOR BRINGING TOTAL RESERVES INTO THAT -- LEVEL THAT WE HAVE SAID WOULD BE. HELPFUL AND IN THAT SCENARIO. MOVING. TO THE NEXT PAGE -- SO -- FEAR NOT I WON'T GO THROUGH THIS ENTIRE SLIGHT IT'S A FULL SLIDE COVERING. A LOT OF A LETTER THE MAJOR PROGRAMMATIC GENERAL FUND SPENDING CONFERENCE ITEMS AND THE THE REASON IT'S A FULL SITE IS REALLY JUST BECAUSE WE WANTED TO PROVIDE FOR YOU SORT OF A ALL IN NE PLACE A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE MAJOR POLICY ITEMS THAT YOU'LL BE CARRYING. IN CONFERENCE AND A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES IN THE IN THE PLANS -- AND SO IT'S REALLY MORE OF A REFERENCE FOR YOU. HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO JUST MENTION A COUPLE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES TO NOTE -- IN THE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AREA THE SENATE INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING -- FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS WHICH IS NOT IN EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO PLANS. AND THE SENATE PLAN ALSO INCLUDES -- FUNDING FOR THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE PACKAGE AND THE PRISON TO COMMUNITY PIPELINE PACKAGE SO THOSE ARE DIFFERENCES THAT YOU'LL BE ADDRESSING IN THE IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. AND ALSO WE DON'T HAVE ON HERE THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS -- AND PROPOSALS. MOSTLY BECAUSE THESE ARE. WHAT YOU EAT WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THAT THERE'S A GENERAL CONCEPTUALIZATION MEANT ABOUT THOSE? AND SO -- AND SOME OF THE DETAILS WILL BE. ALSO SORTED OUT IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BUT THAT'S WHY THAT'S NOT ON HERE AND I WANT TO GO AND GET IT KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER ISSUE WHICH HAS -- POTENTIALLY SOME GENERAL FUND IMPLICATION. WE DID NOT PUT THAT ON HERE MOSTLY -- IN THE INTEREST OF A THE LENGTH OF WHAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE. AND THEN THE OTHER JUST OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. INCLUDES SOME FUNDING THAT WOULD BE SCHEDULED UNDER HIS MULTI YEAR PLAN TO SUNSET AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS. THE THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY -- BOTH DO NOT INCLUDE THOSE SUNSETS IN THEIR PLAN AND BECAUSE THE FUNDING PERTAINS TO PROGRAMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE ONGOING IN NATURE. DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND I HSS -- RATES. WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE TREATING THEM AS AN ON GOING RECOGNIZING THE ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE PROGRAMS IS IS MORE -- APPROPRIATE IN THE IN THE MULTI YEAR PLAN. SO THEN MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE. HERE WE HAVE A SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON OF HOW OF THE THREE PLANS [inaudible] ROACH. MAKING SUPPLEMENTAL DEBT AND LIABILITY PAYMENTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND AGAIN ALL THREE PLANS ALLOCATE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PAYING DOWN DEBT AND WHY IT THE STATE'S DEAD IN LIABILITIES -- THING -- IT YOU KNOW I CAN YOU CAN SEE THIS PEARL OF DRY YOUR ATTENTION TO SOME KEY DIFFERENCES AMONG THE THREE PLANS. FIRST IS THAT THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY PAYS DOWN MORE DEBT THAN THE OTHER TWO PLANS PRIMARILY BECAUSE UNDER HIS PLAN HE MAKES A UP FRONT THREE THREE BILLION DOLLAR. SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE'S CALPERS UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND THE GOVERNOR ALSO INCLUDES ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. FOR I'M DOING -- CERTAIN BUDGET. DEFERRALS THAT THE STATE IS CONTENT HELD HIS STILL CARRYING THAT ARE KIND OF A HOLD OVER FROM THE WRIST. THE LAST RECESSION. THE SENATE DIFFERS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IN THAT ON AT LEAST UP FRONT IT INCLUDES -- SMALLER ONE POINT ONE BILLION SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO THE CALPERS. UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND YOU KNOW THERE THERE WOULD BE -- THERE IS A KIND OF A PLACE HOLDER FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE FUTURE. IF IF -- TAX CONFORMITY REVENUES BECOME AVAILABLE LATER IN THE YEAR. ARE THE ASSEMBLY DIFFERS IN THAT IT PUTS A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR -- CONTRIBUTION TO THE CALPERS CAL CALPERS. LIABILITY BUT IT'S THE CALPERS LIABILITY OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON BEHALF OF THAT ARE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. NOW ONE THING ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE THAT I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT IS JUST THAT. THERE IS ALL THREE PLANS INCLUDE MAKING A THE PENSION CONTRIBUTION ON BEHALF OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR TEACHERS THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PLAN WOULD MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS IN ADDITION TO THAT ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. TO CALPERS. NOW -- THE KEY THING ABOUT THESE CONTRIBUTIONS IS THAT THEY SUPPLANT WHERE THEY ARE IN DESIGNED TO BE IN PLACE OF THE DISTRICTS CONTRIBUTIONS ARE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THE DISTRICTS WOULD OTHERWISE BE MAKING ON THEIR OWN SO IT DOESN'T REPRESENT ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE PENSION SYSTEMS. AND IT DOES NOT. REALLY ALTER THE LONG TERM TRAJECTORY OF THOSE LIABILITIES BUT IT DOES PROVIDE SOME TEMPORARY TEMPORARY RELIEF TO TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- FOR TWO YEARS IN THAT AREA SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE ASSEMBLY CUT BACK ON THE DECK PAGE IF YOU LOOK AT THE ASSEMBLY I HAVE ONE POINT. ONE FIVE BILLION FOR THE CALPERS YOU KNOW. CONTRIBUTION BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS ADDRESSING THE LONG TERM LIABILITY NOT JUST -- US A PLANTATION OF THE NEXT TWO YEAR CONTRIBUTIONS -- PARTIAL SO PLANTATION I SHOULD SAY. SO THEN THE OTHER FINAL POINT I'LL MAKE ON THISSLIDE IS JUST YOU'LL NOTE THAT NEITHER THE SENATE NOR THE ASSEMBLY PLANS INCLUDE FUNDS THAT. ARE ALLOCATED FOR UNDOING SOME OF THE BUDGET LIABILITIES THAT THE GOVERNOR INCLUDES THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. AND WE THINK THIS IS REASONABLE BECAUSE I'M ONE OF THE IDEAS BEHIND ON DOING THE DEFERRALS IS THAT THOSE ARE ACTIONS THAT THE STATE COULD TAKE AGAIN IF IT ENCOUNTERS FISCAL STRESS IN THE FUTURE. WE JUST THINK -- OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN ON RECORD THAT YOU KNOW THOSE RESOURCES PROBABLY WOULD BE BETTER ALLOCATED TO BUILDING HIGHER RESERVES OR ALTERNATIVELY PAIN DOWN. LONGER TERM DEBT WITH KIND OF MORE. WE JUST THINK THERE'S A BETTER RETURN ON PAIN DOWN LONGER TERM DEBT AND DIRECTING THOSE FUNDS TO UNDOING THE DEFERRALS. BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THERE -- SO THAT TAKES US HERE TO THE TO THE FINAL. PAGE IN THIS SLIDE DECK. THEN AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO STEP BACK AND POINT OUT THE YOU KNOW AT THIS MOMENT THE STATE HAS A VERY LARGE ROUTE. BUDGETARY SURPLUS HEALTHY RESERVES AND BUT IT'S NOT LIKELY TO BE A SITUATION THAT WILL PERSIST ON A RECURRING BASIS. AND SO ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT THE BEST WAY FOR THE STATE -- TO AIR FOR THE FUTURE IS TO BUILD LARGER RESERVES NOW THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR RECOMMENDED IN THAT AREA WE THINK THE ASSEMBLY -- GOES THE FURTHEST AND THEN WE ALSO THINK THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING -- SUPPLEMENTAL DEBT PAYMENTS. THE TARGETING THOSE MORE TOWARD -- DEBTS THAT WOULD HAVE A TWO MORE DAYS PREPARE THE STATE FOR THE FUTURE PROBABLY. A BETTER USE OF THOSE RESOURCES. AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE POSITION THAT THE STATE IS AND IT IS. KIND OF ONE ONE WAY TO SAY IT IS THAT. D. ACTIONS THAT THE STATE TAKES NOW WITH THIS HEALTHY SURPLUS WILL IN MANY WAYS TO FIND ITS EXPERIENCE THROUGH THE NEXT DOWNTURN. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES AVOIDING HAVING TO MAKE AS MANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS IN THE NEXT DOWNTURN. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE STRONG A SURPLUS POSITION NOW TO SET ASIDE SOME OF THAT FOR RESERVES WOULD LESSEN THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW THIS IS A POLICY CHOICE AND TO THE EXTENT THE MEMBERS. WOULD PREFER TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU. BE WILLING TO MAKE MORE -- POLICY CHANGES TO RESPOND TO A RECESSIONARY SITUATION. YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF THE TRADE OFF. AND SO ARE OUR RECOMMENDATION OF COURSE IS TO DO THE RESERVES A LITTLE BIT HIGHER AND AND TO PAY DOWN MORE OF THE LONG TERM DEBTS. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO YOUR FROM FINANCE CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WELCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR WE HAVE CROSSED PATHS BEFORE. THAT'S RIGHT IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU IN THIS POSITION. I KNOW THAT TERM. SOME LONG STANDING INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES DON'T DIE EASILY. BUT I'M WONDERING COULD WE STOP PUTTING PARENTHESES AROUND SUBTITLES. BRING TO A FINAL STOP DOING THAT THIS. THE CPA JUST GONE NUTS. I AM. I HAVE TO SAY IT SENATORS. ARE LAUGHING YEAH. I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND REALIZED THAT IT WAS ONE QUESTION THAT I COULD PROBABLY PREPARE MYSELF FOR FROM BUT WE HAVE A WORKING GROUP THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO LOOK AT THAT ISSUE. WELL IF YOU NEED ANOTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER JUST LET ME KNOW -- BUT OUT I COULD SHOW YOU HOW TO DO UNDER LINES AND DOUBLE UNDER LINES AT THE APPROPRIATE PLACES BUT I CONCUR WITH YOUR CONCLUSION I AM. OF REAL CONCERNED [inaudible] ABOUT. NOT MISSING THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS BUDGET SURPLUS AND THEN IT IN IT COMES IN A FEW AREAS -- I I I RESULT A LITTLE. MAYBE JUST LIKE A GENERAL OVERVIEW MADAM CHAIR BUT WITH FRONT PAGE. FOR ROOM WE WERE SHOWING THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO PUT THREE BILLION AND TAKE CALPERS. THAT'S THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO BE DOING RIGHT NOW WITH THE SURPLUS IN FACT IT MIGHT BE. A LITTLE. LOW IT COULD PROBABLY BE HIGHER. I'M GOING GOING FORWARD BECAUSE YOU CAN BENEFIT FROM LOWER. ANNUAL REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE FUTURE BUT YOU COULD ALSO SAY WAIT A SECOND WE'RE REALLY IN A TIGHT SPOT WE COULD USE IT AS A AS A WAY. TO OFFSET A FUTURE CONTRIBUTION AND SAY LET'S TAKE IT FROM. NINETEEN TWENTY APPLY IT -- SO I I WAS I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- IN LOOKING AT THE BUDGET BUT I'M I'M ALSO CONCERNED. ABOUT. THE FACT THAT. I'M BIG OVERVIEW THAT WE HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE REALLY STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW SOMEHOW PROP NINETY EIGHT ISN'T CUTTING IT. AND I JUST WORRY THAT WERE NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH MONEY IN THE RESERVE. FOR FOR FOR THE SCHOOLS WERE WERE WERE ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW FIGHTING OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION OR ZERO AT LEAST THE GOVERNOR IS IS TRYING TO START FINDING -- A RAINY DAY FUND FOR THE SCHOOLS BUT AS YOU KNOW YOU'VE LOOKED AT ENOUGH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER YOUR YEARS AT STANDARD AND POOR'S IS THAT. THE THE UNFUNDED RETIREE MEDICAL IS NOW SHOWING UP ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AND I HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT THE SIZE OF THE NUMBERS -- JUST YOU KNOW WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SACRAMENTO CITY IT'S IN THE NEWS HERE LOCALLY [inaudible] EVERY. EVERY WEEK WE GET AN ARTICLE BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT FROM JUNE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. OF THE DEFICIT ANY WINTER ONE POINT. ZERO SIX FIVE BILLION IT WENT UP FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX BILLION IN ONE YEAR DOUBLED. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION. TO SENATE SEPARATIST CAN UNIFIED IS GONE FROM SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION UPSIDE DOWN TO ONE POINT TWO BILLION UPSIDE DOWN. IN ONE YEAR FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS A SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WENT FROM ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO ONE POINT. SEVEN THEY WENT UP. THERE DEFICIT WENT UP TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION LA U. S. THE WAS A REAL SHOCKER IT WENT FROM. TEN BILLION EIGHT FIFTY SIX TO NINETEEN BILLION FIVE FIFTY SIX AT EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION. IN MORE LIABILITIES BEING REPORTED ON THE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SO I I AM. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT TEAM AND AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND OR LOAN. MONEY TO SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THAT. SUMMER THE BUDGET SO JUST SOMETHING. TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE SHOULD THIS RECESSION THAT WE'RE BOTH CONCERNED ABOUT COM. WE'RE GOING TO GET HIT BY. ROOM DECLINING REVENUES. INCREASED PAYMENT IT'S TO THE PENSION PLAN BECAUSE THE PENSION PLAN WILL SUFFER FROM A BAD ECONOMY AND THEREFORE ANNUAL REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS WILL GO UP. IN THE SCHOOLS WILL BE COMING TO US AND WERE WERE FLASHING RIGHT NOW CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE NOT. THEY HAVE VERY LIMITED. ABILITY TO RAISE REVENUES WERE SAYING LA UNIFIED DOING A PARCEL TAX IN A COUPLE WEEKS MAYBE A WEEK OR NEXT WEEK. SOME THINGS ARE WORKING ARE TELLING US THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS. WE WE HAVE AN INVERTED YIELD CURVE WHICH YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH WHICH HAS BEEN. AN ACCURATE INDICATOR OF A UPCOMING RECESSION OVER THE LAST SIXTY YEARS. SO SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE AT LEAST TRYING TO WARN US A LITTLE BIT. THAT WE SHOULD REALLY BE LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. AND AND AND HAVING BEEN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE RECESSION OTHER I'M OLD ENOUGH YOU KNOW DID SOME OF US DON'T REALIZE WHAT A RECESSION IS LIKE IT WAS ELEVEN YEARS AGO OR TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD THAT. THE GREAT RECESSION AND IN. NINETY FOUR AND THAT'S TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT IT YOU KNOW I HAD THE PRIVILEGE COLLEAGUES OF HAVING TO LAY OFF A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT TIME TO BE A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. AND SO THE MORE WE CAN DO NOW. TO POSITION OURSELVES FOR A DOWNTURN -- THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE SO OUR MANAGER THANK YOU FOR AT LEAST LETTING ME. SURE A FEW OF THOSE CONCERNS PROVIDE I WANT TO WELCOME OUR NEW. LA -- AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US IN NUMBER AND FOR FOR JUMPING INTO THE JOB. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU US AND MORE LIKE FOR SURE YOU PERSPECTIVE I'LL GO TO A VICE CHAIR TEEN AND THEN TO CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST A QUICK QUESTION TELLING NOW -- THE THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY. DECIDED TO HAVE CERTAIN RESTORATION OF SERVICES LIKE AND HELP SUPPORT SERVICES DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. AND WE SCORED THOSE IS ONGOING RATHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION DID A SUNSET WHICH SEEMED A LITTLE BIT ODD BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THOSE RESOURCES WOULD GO TO HIRING PEOPLE THAN THEY WERE CAPITAL THEY'RE NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD JUST SORT OF BUY SOMETHING FOR A YEAR IN THE NOT BY. SOMETHING SO YOU BE HIRING PEOPLE THAN LAYING PEOPLE OFF COULD COULD YOU COMMENT IS. ON THOSE ON THOSE DIFFERENCES AND SORT OF PHONE WERE YOU THINK ABOUT THE WELL. I CAN COME IN AT A HIGH LEVEL AND TO THE DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HEARING I THINK MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE BUT WHAT -- I MEAN IN AT THE HIGH LEVEL WE CONCUR THAT THESE ARE -- ARE MORE ON GOING IN NATURE THESE THE THE PROGRAMS THAT THIS FUNDING IS GOING. FOR AND OUR ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN. TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS SUCH AND SO -- YOU KNOW. IT I MEAN I THINK WE GENERALLY -- STINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY PAINTING. TO PROBABLY A TRUER PICTURE OF THE STATE'S FISCAL TRAJECTORY OVER THE MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK SO -- THE I THINK WE WE AGREE WITH THAT. THE FOR SAME QUESTION FINANCE WHEN THEY COME UP SENATOR NELSON STATE CONTEXT -- MORLOCK TALKED BRIEFLY ABOUT THE LOCAL EXPERIENCE AND NOW THAT TRANSLATES TO WHAT WE DO HERE. BUT A FEW YEARS AGO WE ADAM. BIG SURPLUS TO NOT AS GREAT AS THIS. ONE THE GOT SPENT. SPENT IN THE COMBINATION OF NEW PROGRAMS BASED BUILDING. AND EVEN SOME TAX DECREASES AND THEY DID NOT. PROVED TO BE A FORMULA FOR THE FUTURE. THIS VERY QUICKLY. THE ECONOMY SOFTENED. I THINK WE STARTED WHEN I CAME BACK IN OLD AGE WE WERE. FIFTEEN BILLION IN THE RED. ONE UP TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION. SHOWS HOW QUICKLY THAT CAN COME AROUND. AND WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT. TO ON THE WEALTH OF THE TECH. INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. I AM NOT A COMMUNIST AND I DON'T SPEAK WITH ANY PARTICULAR DATA BUT I'M FEARFUL THAT THAT'S GOING TO SOFTEN AS WELL AND SO. WHAT I HAVE SUGGESTED AS TO THIS BUDGET? THE WE CONTINUE TO BE PRUDENT. PRUDENT IN TERMS OF LONG TERM BASE BUILDING [inaudible] OBLIGATIONS. I BELIEVE YOU'RE CAUTIONING US IN THE SAME MANNER. AM I CORRECT IN THAT. YEAH IS IT BUT I THINK THAT SAYS SOMETHING WE DO AGREE WITH YES. ANOTHER SUBTLE THING. AND AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE DATA BILL BY BILL. BUT I DO READ A LOT OF THE BILLS. AND OVER RECENT YEARS. PARTICULAR LAST TWO YEARS IT SEEMS TO BECOME MORE OF A HABIT HERE. OF PUTTING IN A GIVEN SPENDING BILL FOR A CERTAIN IDEA. SUBJECT TO FUTURE APPROPRIATIONS. OF THE LEGISLATURE. NOW THAT ISN'T. NECESSARILY OF BINDING THING ONE LEGISLATURE CAN'T BIND A FUTURE. ONE BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE BUILDING. PROGRAMS BASED ON FUTURE EXPENDITURES. VOTE BY FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S WHAT THAT DOES IS PUT PRESSURE ON THOSE FUTURE LEGISLATORS TO EMBRACE THOSE PROGRAMS. THERE IF YOU WILL WAITING IN THE WINGS. THAT IS NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION. BUT AS AN OBSERVATION OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD WAX FOR QUESTION HERE MMHM MMHM. YOU SIR MISTER MCCARTY THANK YOU. THIS I THINK WILL BE ADDRESSED IN OUR EDUCATION PIECE IN A LITTLE BIT BUT I CONCUR THAT. SCHOOLS ARE STRAPPED IN BUT CENTER MORE LIKE SAID. ANYMORE WE COULD PUT INTO THAT CAL STIRS OUR CALPERS PAYMENTS ARE DISTRICTS CERTAINLY HELPS THEM WITH THEIR ONGOING. EXPENDITURES AND THE REALITY THAT EVEN THE WORST SPENDING CHáVEZ MODELS. THESE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STILL STRAPPED RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO LA IN OAKLAND. SO AS WHEN I GO BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID AT THE LA ON THE YOU SAID THE MAYBE YOU PREFER THAT WE HAVE A HIGHER [inaudible] RESERVE AMOUNTS. THAT SAID ACCURATE. IF THAT'S THE CASE IT WILL YEAH HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO THAT. WELL MOSTLY I THINK. WHAT WE ARE -- OUR POINT IS THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD -- SHOULD CONSIDER ADOPTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF OVERALL RESERVES THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. AND ACTUALLY BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY PLANS ARE HIGHER THE ASSEMBLY BY A SOMEWHAT MORE THAN THAN THE SENATE BUT SO. I MEAN. WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY -- SPELLING OUT A DEFINITIVE -- A PRECISE NUMBER I THINK IT'S A IT'S A DIFFICULT TO SETTLE ON WHAT THE EXACT. RIGHT LEVEL SHOULD BE BUT WE THINK THAT THE HIGHER LEVELS INCLUDED IN BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PLANTS IN PARTICULAR ASSEMBLY PLANTS. ARE GETTING INTO THE RANGE THAT WE THINK IS PRUDENT. OKAY AND THEN AGAIN WHAT WE'RE GONNA GET TO EDUCATION A BET. BUT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS JANUARY BUDGET. THAT PUT INTO TO BUY DOWN SOME THAT RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND BOTH HOUSES WHAT A LITTLE BIT MORE. I SIMPLY THINK THAT SUCH A PRUDENT APPROACH AND AND DO YOU THINK IS OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO. EVEN MORE KNOWING THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP OUR STRAPS SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE ABSENCE OF INCREASED LCF THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY. YES WE DO THINK IT'S HELPFUL -- IN PARTICULAR WE THINK THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A SORT OF A LONGER TERM BENEFIT -- SO THERE'S SORT OF A TRADE OFF IF YOU PUT IF YOU MAKE. A LARGER CONTRIBUTION THAN IS REQUIRED TO THE PENSION SYSTEMS NOW. FOR THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY YOU HAVE A AN ABILITY. TO INCREMENTALLY LOWER THE ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL BE NECESSARY GOING FORWARD. IN A ANOTHER THING THAT THE STATE CAN DO IS SIMPLY GIVE MONEY UP FRONT TO PAY. A PORTION OF THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IN A SPECIFIC YEAR NOT ADDING TO WHAT IS OTHERWISE PAID BUT JUST PAIN PART OF THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS ON THEIR BEHALF. AND THAT'S THAT'S ALSO INCLUDED IN ALL THREE PLANS. AND IT DOES PROVIDE. SIGNIFICANT FISCAL RELIEF FOR THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE WOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT YOU KNOW. OUR POINT IS JUST THAT THAT IS A FORM OF TEMPORARY FISCAL RELIEF IN IN THAT AREA. VERSUS THE OTHER BUT IT'S LARGER IT'S LARGER UP FRONT TEMPORARY FISCAL RELIEF THEN THE THE OTHER OPTION OF PUTTING. A LARGE CONTRIBUTION INTO THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY INTO THE SYSTEM YES I I HEAR POINTS ACTUALLY IS LIKE. PAYING SOMEONE'S MORTGAGE PAYMENT FOR A FEW MONTHS VERSUS BUYING DOWN THE PRINCIPLE OF THEIR LOAN THAT'S THE ANALOGY I USED WITH MY COLLEAGUES THE OTHER DAY OKAY THERE YOU GO. SO AT IT ONCE MAYOR NOT BE MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN THE OTHERS ARE YOU RECOMMENDING A COMBINATION OF THOSE OR HURT. UNDER THE LOWER JUST WERE A CAST THE THING WERE WERE RECOMMENDED TO POINT OUT IS THAT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FISCAL PRESSURES THAT MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE UNDER RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY AT A LEVEL WHERE. IN A NON RECESSIONARY ENVIRONMENT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING LEVEL IS. IS -- HI AND YOU KNOW WE'RE PROVIDING THEM FISCAL RIVER YOU KNOW THE THESE PLANS WOULD PROVIDE FISCAL RELIEF AT A TIME WHEN. YOU KNOW THE THE REVENUES ARE ARGUABLY AT A AT A HIGHER POINT. AND SO IN THE FUTURE -- IN A IN A WEAKER CLIMATE [inaudible] YOU KNOW. ONE IDEA THAT WE HAD EARLIER IN THE YEAR WAS THAT YOU COULD -- SET ASIDE THESE FUNDS. TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF TO THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR A TIME WHEN THE BROADER STATE BUDGET IS IN A MORE STRESSED SITUATION. OF COURSE THE THE AND FOR YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY WITH THAT YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING FISCAL RELIEF -- RIGHT NOW AND THERE'S THERE'S SOME DISTRICTS AS PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THAT ARE. THAT ARE -- ALREADY IN FISCAL PRESSURE SO I MEAN I THINK WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS YOU KNOW KIND OF AT A CERTAIN POINT IT BECOMES A CHOICE -- ON PART OF THE LEGISLATURE WHICH HOW YOU WANT TO PROCEED WITH THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE EVEN WITH A LARGE SURPLUS THE RESOURCES ARE FINITE AND YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE OF ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE THEM SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MANAGER YOU'RE VERY WELCOME SIR [inaudible] MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT'S AN HONOR TO BE SERVING WITH YOU ONCE AGAIN ON THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. I JUST WANT TO CHIME IN HERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT OF THE ANALOGY OF MAKING SOMEONE'S MORTGAGE PAYMENT FOR THEM IS AN INTERESTING AN APT ONE BUT JUST LIKE THAT ANALOGY. I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO PRINCIPLE IN THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO INTEREST AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHEN WE MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE LONG TERM PERSON STIRS LIABILITIES. FOR PAYING DOWN A LOT MORE OF FUTURE PAYMENTS THEN WE ARE IF WE JUST ALLOW THEM. TO HELP US MAKE THE PAYMENT THIS YEAR INSTEAD OF THEM SO -- HI. IF I GOT MY WAY IT WOULD ALL BE A LIEU GOING TOWARDS LONG TERM LIABILITIES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THOSE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE INVESTING. THAT WOULD YOU CONCUR WITH THAT. YEAH A AGREE WITH THE MATHEMATICS THAT YOUR SKETCHING OUT THE THE THE TRADE OFF IS THAT IT'S OVER THE LONGER TERM YEAR AFTER YEAR IT'S GONNA IT WILL REPRESENT A LESS NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION THEN. YOU KNOW IT'S VERY NOTICEABLE WHEN THE CONTRIBUTION RATES DECLINED TO SIXTEENTH FROM 18% JULES SO PLANTATION IN THESE TWO YEARS SO. A I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THE DIFFERENCE SIR I AGREE WITH YOU. HOWEVER I THINK WE KIND OF KICKED THE CAN BIND DOWN THE ROAD IF WE MAKE THE PAYMENTS THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO MAKE IT THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO ADJUST TO THOSE HIGHER PAYMENTS. NEXT YEAR BECAUSE NO ONE PRETENDS THAT THE RATE AT THE THE PERCENTAGE IS GOING TO GO DOWN ANY TIME SOON. YEAH I MEAN THESE ARE THIS IS THESE ARE THE TRADE OFFS THAT WE'VE TRIED TO SKETCH OUT AND I I JUST THINK THAT. pKNOW ONCE WE'VE PUT THEM BEFORE YOU THEN IT'LL BE A DECISION OF THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE WANT TO FINANCE. FINANCE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S COVERED A NUMBER OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THREE GENERAL POINTS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE FIRST IS A POINT THAT I KNOW WE ALL APPRECIATE IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE -- CREATING THIS BUDGET IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF A HEALTHY SURPLUS BUT ALSO GROWING RISKS. AND I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA WHICH IS ON GOING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WERE TEN YEARS INTO AN ECONOMIC EXPANSION WHICH WILL BE THIS SUMMER. THE LONGEST SINCE WORLD WAR TWO AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ENVIRONMENT OF SLOWING GLOBAL GROWTH AND IN ADDITION TO THAT IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. HAS SENATOR MORE WALK MENTIONED -- WE'VE SEEN AN INVERSION OF THE YIELD CURVE IN WHICH RATES ON THE TEN YEAR TREASURY NOTE OR ACTUALLY LOWER THAN RATES ARE ON A ONE MONTH TREASURY NOTE MEANING THAT. INVESTORS ARE DEMANDING LAST ON AN ANALYZED BASIS TO LOCK UP THEIR MONEY FOR TEN YEARS AND THEY ARE FOR ONE MONTH BECAUSE THEY ARE. PROJECTING THAT RATES WILL BE LOWER IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY HAVE TO CUT THEM. IN A RECESSION SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE ALL PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO AT FINANCE AND I KNOW TO ROUTE STATE GOVERNMENT. THINKING ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING I WAS REMINDED OF AN OLD SAYING BY JAMES CARVILLE WHO WAS. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE HE SAID AFTER THAT HE SAID YOU KNOW I ALWAYS THOUGHT IF THERE WERE REINCARNATION. I'D WANT TO COME BACK AS THE PRESIDENT OR MAYBE A BATTING AVERAGE OF FOUR HUNDRED HALL OF FAMER IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES BUT HE SAID. NOW SEEING THIS I WANT TO COME BACK AS THE BOND MARKET BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU REALLY INTIMIDATE EVERYBODY. SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO WATCH VERY CLOSELY WE'RE NOT -- PROJECTING A RECESSION BUT WE ARE PLANNING FOR IT. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS AS A RESULT OF THAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING A BUDGET RESILIENCY AND I KNOW WE ARE HAVINGAN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TODAY AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. ABOUT RESERVES -- BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A RECORD THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION THAT WE WANT TO BUILD RESERVES WE WANT TO PAY DOWN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND WE WANT TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP OVER THE FROM THE LAST RECESSION THAT WE ARE STILL DIGGING OUR WAY. OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION MAINTAINS A VERY FIRM POSITION ON FINALLY PAYING DOWN THAT WALL TAX WHICH AT ONE POINT WAS OVER THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS AND THE DEBTS AND DEFERRALS -- THAT WERE BEING DISCUSSED ARE PART OF THAT SO THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ADMINISTRATION COMMITMENT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT A REQUISITE AMOUNT NOT JUST INTO RESERVES BUT INTO PAYING DOWN OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES BECAUSE THOSE PAYMENTS NOT ONLY HELP US NEXT YEAR. BUT IN THE YEAR AFTER THAT AFTER THAT AND AFTER THAT. AND MOST OF ALL WE WANT TO PUT A REAL EMPHASIS ON STRUCTURAL BALANCE NOT ONLY -- IN ACTING A BALANCED BUDGET THIS YEAR BUT ALSO LOOKING OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AFTER DAYS IN OUR MULTI YEAR FORECAST MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE MATCHING ON GOING SPENDING. WITH ONGOING REVENUES IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OPERATING SURPLUS IN EVERY YEAR BECAUSE AS ALL OF US KNOW IF WE END UP OVERSHOOTING THE MARK AND HAVING MORE RESERVES AT THE END OF A GIVEN YEAR OVER THAT MULTI YEAR PERIOD. DAN WE EXPECTED WE CAN ALWAYS SPEND THAT MONEY AT THAT TIME BUT IF WE END UP HAVING LESS MONEY AND GO INTO AN OPERATING TO DEFICIT. THEN WE'LL BE BACK AT THE TABLE FIGURING OUT WHICH EXPANSIONS WILL HAVE TO ROLL BACK. AND SO ALONG WITH THAT WERE HOPING THAT ALL MAJOR -- FISCAL ISSUES THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED THIS YEAR WILL BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND I KNOW THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION AROUND SUNSETS AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH MAKING SURE THAT WERE BALANCED AND OUT YEARS AS WELL. AND HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS PART OF THIS PROCESS AS WELL. AND THEN THE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION VERY BRIEFLY -- WE WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT BUT THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE USED -- RELIED ON DEAL LESS REVENUES -- TO PUT TOGETHER THEIR BUDGETS AND WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE WE KNOW THAT IN A DEMOCRACY PUTTING TOGETHER A BUDGET IS A POLITICAL PROCESS AS IT SHOULD BE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO REVENUES IN PROJECTIONS OTHER PROFESSIONALS AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AND THOSE ARE COMPLETED BEFORE THE GOVERNOR MAKES ANY MAJOR DECISIONS ABOUT THE BUDGET. SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT WE DO BELIEVE IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE THE NUMBERS WORK AND ACHIEVE STRUCTURAL BALANCE OVER THE LONG TERM. WE DO RELY ON A TAX CONFORMITY PACKAGE TO RAISE REVENUES TO PAY FOR EXPANDED EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WE DO THINK THERE ARE SOME ISSUES -- IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES NOT TO ADOPT THAT TAX CONFORMITY PACKAGE BUT TO FUND THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE AT THE LEVEL THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING. I'M SO HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE DETAILS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT INCLUDING THE TAX CUT FROM THE PACKAGE WHAT THE HIGHER REVENUES THAT RESULTS AND INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. IS THE BEST WAY TO GO HERE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT AN MCO TAX -- BECAUSE THOSE REVENUES ARE NOT CERTAIN AND RELY ON APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE BEST PATH FORWARD BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THOSE REVENUES. SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS BECAUSE AS PART OF THIS PROCESS WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REVENUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ARE COMMITTED TO SPENDING. IS ACTUALLY REVENUE THAT WE DO HAVE IN HAND -- AND THEN THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE WHICH WE CAN TALK ABOUT EITHER TODAY OR WHEN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMES OUT. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE GROWTH OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SPENDING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THAT RIGHT BECAUSE IF WE UNDER SHOOT THERE THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT AS WELL AND SO OVERALL YOU KNOW HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS AND A THE BUDGET CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH YOU MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF -- AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT BUILDING A STRONG FOUNDATION WHICH I KNOW SOMETHING WE ALL AGREE ON REALLY IS THAT PREDATOR TO EXPANDING PROGRAMS AND MAKING A BUDGET THAT NOT ONLY WE CAN STAND BEHIND THIS YEAR. BUT IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR. THANK. YOU MISTER TING THANK YOU. WELCOME TO THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEES GREAT GREAT TO HAVE YOU WE GOT USED TO HAVING A ME THE LAST COUPLE YEARS SO IT'S NICE TO HAVE. TO CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE BIT. QUICK QUESTIONS ON JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON MY QUESTION -- TALLY HO WAS REGARDING THE DECISION TO SUNSET WHAT WE PERCEIVE AS ONGOING. PROGRAMS DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES -- JUST ONE UNDERSTAND WHY. pTO ASSISTANCE TO BE A LITTLE BIT DISINGENUOUS TO FUND THE PROGRAM HOW. TO HIRE PEOPLE FOR TWO YEARS AND THEN. LAY THEM OFF SO I JUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOUR THINKING WAS AROUND THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE FOR US WE WOULD RATHER NOT DO IT IF YOU'RE GONNA ST? SUNSET IT IN TWO YEARS THEN WHY EVEN PUT IT IN THE BUDGET TO BEGIN WITH. YEAH SO THAT WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION AS PART OF THAT NAY REVISION WHEN THE GOVERNOR WAS THINKING THROUGH IT AND BASICALLY FOR TWO REASONS ONE MAJORITY KNOWLEDGE DAYS -- TRYING TO CREATE A STRUCTURAL BALANCE IN THE OUT YEARS SO WE FELT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO EXTEND THIS BE ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT. THAT I ACCEPT AND ONCE REVENUES CHANGER THE WHOLE BUDGET ARCHITECTURE CHANGES IN SOME WAY WHICH IS A CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IN THOSE SPECIFIC AREAS -- AND YOU KNOW IT CAN BE EASY TO LOOK AT THIS AND SAY THIS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THIS WAY BUT WE TO BELIEVE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHCARE GENERALLY. AND DDS MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE RATE STUDY THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANGES IN A LOT OF REFORM EFFORTS THAT ARE ON GOING SO WE BELIEVE BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S MORE THAN TWO YEARS FROM NOW -- THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL OF ADVANCED AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER A GREATER LEVEL OF SERVICE WITH LESS COST. SUE SO YOU'RE NOT ENVISIONING THE THE WAY YOUR BUDGET STRUCTURED YOU'RE HIRING PEOPLE AND THEN LAY THEM OFF IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU'RE. ENVISIONED. OVER IN BEIJING AT SUNSET RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT YOU KNOW ONCE THOSE REFORM EFFORTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHAT THOSE EFFORTS WILL LOOK LIKE AT THAT TIME BUT TO DIRECTLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY -- WE HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY TO GET THE MONEY. SENATE FOR THESE ONGOING PROGRAMS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING. ABOUT. YOU TO YOU'RE TALKING. TO TO TWO FORMER HEADS OF NONPROFIT SO AS FORMER HEADS OF NON PROFITS YOU YOU'RE GIVEN MONEY. FROM GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE TO DELIVER THE SERVICE THAT YOU PROMISED TO GO. DELIVER. ANY BE HARD FOR US IN THIS ECONOMY TO HIRE PEOPLE AND THEN TELL THEM YOU CAN. WHEN ARE YOU BUT ONLY SAID THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION RIGHT NOW IS BEYOND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE ON GOING REVENUE TO FUND THOSE PROGRAMS BEYOND THAT DATE. AT THIS TIME SO WHY ARE THE IN THE BUDGET WENT UP JUST HAVE REAL ONE TIME. EXPENDITURES INSTEAD OF HAVING THESE THESE TWO THINGS IN THE BUDGET. I THINK THE MAIN REASON IS WE SEE IT WE UNDERSTAND THOSE NEEDS RIGHT NOW THIS RATE STUDY HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT MEDICAID SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO INCREASE ACCESS WE WANT TO INCREASE THOSE FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING SOWE ENVISION THIS AS A BRIDGE WHERE WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE RE GETTING A GREATER LEVEL SERVICE WHICH AS YOU NOTED. THERE IS THE DEMAND OUT THERE WHILE WE WORK TOWARD A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IT IS A DIFFICULT TO TO THE CAN ARE YOU DOING. TO PROVIDING THIS HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY TO TO THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN OUR STATE. NO IT WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION TO INCLUDE THE SUNSET AND AS AS YOU NOTED IT WAS NOT IN THE JANUARY BUDGET IT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR REVENUE PICTURE FOR THE OUT YOUR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND AGAIN THIS IS A PROCESS AS MENTIONED THAT. WITH IT HAPPENS BEFORE THE GOVERNOR MAKES ANY DECISIONS ACTUALLY CAME IN AT ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS LOWER THAN WE PROJECTED. AND SO THEY'RE SIMPLY -- GOIG BACK TO THE PRINCIPLE MATCHING ON GOING SPENDING WITH ON GOING REVENUE THERE SIMPLY WASN'T THE ABILITY TO PUT THAT ON GOING SPENDING AND BEYOND THAT YEAR. PROGRAM WHICH WE WHICH WE TO UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THEN I WHAT I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHY I WAS EVEN IN THE BUDGET THAT. WHY WAS IT WHY THE TWO YEAR PROCESS BECAUSE WE DO WE DO THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO AND SO IN ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALWAYS DO WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S AND ALL OF YOU? MAKING YOUR DECISIONS THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THEM TOGETHER AND SO WE FELT WITH THESE PIECES WHAT'S AT LEAST TRY TO DO WHAT WE CAN WITH THESE TEN MORE. TO REVENUES ARE NOW MORE TEMPORARY THAN WE THOUGHT THEY WERE BEFORE EXPAND ACCESS NOW AND HOPE WE CAN WORK TOWARD SOME SOLUTION AND THAT'S WISHING TO TAKE A NUMBER OF FORMS AT OUR COMBINATION A COULD TAKE SOME REFORM. THERE COULD BE NEW REVENUES EITHER IN THE LEGISLATURE THERE CONTINUE REVENUES ON THE BALLOT THEIR NUMBER OF THINGS THAT COULD CHANGE BETWEEN NOW. AND THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPEFUL THAT THE REVENUE PICTURE COULD IMPROVE YOU KNOW I KNOW WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT DOOM AND GLOOM UP HERE WITH THE INVERTED YIELD CURVE BUT A NUMBER OF THINGS COULD HAPPEN SO. IF THERE IS A WAY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE REFORM EFFORTS AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN EQUAL OR EVEN GREATER LEVEL OF SERVICE TO PEOPLE WE DO WANT TO FIND A WAY TO TO THAT. BUT LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS THEY-AMOUNT OF ONE TIME VERSUS I'M GOING SPENDING THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE SIMPLY WERE NOT ABLE TO BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER AN HONEST BUDGET THAT WE COULD PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE. EXTEND THOSE PROGRAMS BEYOND AND OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THANK YOU. TO QUESTION ON MCO TAX THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT BOTH THE THE SENATE VERSION IN THE ASSEMBLY VERSION INCLUDING -- JUST WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THAT WAS INCLUDED. I THINK I'LL SPEAK FOR OUR HOUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY REASONABLE PROPOSAL TO PUT IN SPECIALLY SENSE -- MANY OF US. WHO HAVE BEEN HERE ACTUALLY VOTED TO SUPPORT THAT? TAX WITH INDUSTRY SUPPORT ALSO GIVEN THE THE GOVERNOR'S HIGH PRIORITY REGARDING HEALTH CARE SMOKER. OF SMART WAY TO FIND SOME OF THE IMPORTANT HEALTHCARE PROPOSALS HE WAS PUTTING FORWARD SO JUST WANNA. GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHY DOT TOSSING LIKE THE EASIEST OF ALL THE DIFFERENT TAX PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD. THIS IS JUST ONE UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN YOUR BUDGET. YEAH SO THE MAIN REASON WE WE PUT TOGETHER BUDGET THAT FUNDED THE ADMINISTRATION'S KEEP PROPOSALS WITHOUT READ THAT REVENUE WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON GETTING THAT PACKAGE PASSED AND HOPEFULLY GETTING FEDERAL APPROVAL BUT IT'S SIMPLY NOT GUARANTEED AND YOU KNOW IF THERE IS. ONE THING HARDER THAN PREDICTING WHETHER RECESSION WILL HAPPEN IT'S PREDICTING WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE ON ANY GIVEN DAY. SO I THINK WE FELT THAT LET'S GET TO THE BUDGET WHERE WE KNOW BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS THAT THESE REVENUES TO DATE THE BEST CHANCE OF COMING IN. AND THEN HEN IT COMES TO AN MCO PACKAGE WERE APPROVAL IS UNCERTAIN WE CAN WORK ON CRAFTING WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW FROM THE LAST TIME OF THIS GO AROUND. THESE MTO TAX PACKAGES ARE VERY COMPLICATED I EVEN GOVERNOR BROWN WHO HAS SOME EXPERIENCE IN SACRAMENTO CLAIMS HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT HIMSELF SO WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO GET THE PARAMETERS EXACTLY RIGHT. SO THAT WE MAXIMIZE THE CHANCE OF APPROVAL IN DC AND WE KNOW THAT THEY APPROVED A TAX IN OHIO AND MOST RECENTLY IN MICHIGAN -- BUT WE JUST WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN GIVE AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON THAT NEEDS NO EXPLANATION TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE POSITION AND AS PART OF THAT CONVERSATION -- GOVERNOR WANTS TO WORK WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO ALLOCATE THOSE REVENUES -- BUT WITH WE TO PUT IT IN THE BUDGET PACKAGE AND FOR WHATEVER REASON THOSE REVENUES DON'T COME THROUGH IN THE WAY THAT WE INTO ANTICIPATE. AND WE HAD A NINE OR TEN SPEAKER HOLE IN OUR BUDGET THAT WILL HAVE TO PLUG LATER. TO TRULY% APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT AND I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK SOMEONE SHAMELESSLY WAS QUOTED THAT HEALTHCARE IS COMPLICATED. SO I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT -- HAVE THE SAID THAT THIS IS THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE SOMEWHAT ADMINISTRATION GLAD. I KNOW THAT WHEN WE HAD REACHED OUT TO THE MINISTRATION IN JANUARY -- FOR ASSISTANCE IN PARTICULAR FROM DH CS -- WE'RE WERE UNABLE TO GET ASSISTANCE. SO WE WOULD REALLY HOPE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- THAT DEPARTMENT PARTICULAR COULD WORK WITH US ON THAT THERE SEEM TO BE SIGNIFICANT MATTER RETICENCE TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH WASHINGTON. YOU KNOW IN IN THIS IN THIS LINE OF WORK IF YOU DON'T ASK YOU DON'T GET AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T ASK -- WE'RE NOT GETTING AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS HIS YEAH I I THINK THERE DEFINITELY IS A WAY. TO AGAIN -- PROPOSAL ATTACKS BUT THAT ALSO WE COULD SET ASIDE ALL THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT WE WERE FUNDING SO THAT IF WE CAN. THEY DIDN'T COME TO FRUITION THEY WOULD JUST END UP IN RESERVE WHICH WOULD SEEM TO BE FISCALLY PRUDENT WAY TO TACKLE ABOUT IT. THANK YOU THANK. BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THIRTY NIELSEN JUST KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON SITTING FLASHPOINT -- I'M ASSUMING THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAIVERS THAT THAT -- VERTICALLY IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AREA THAT ARE. AWAITING RESPONSE OR ARE IN THE PIPELINE TO AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL IS AT OKAY NINE TWO IN PARTICULAR AND THESE ARE COMING UP IN THE UP COMING YEAR THERE'S AN ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER FOR OVERALL. AND THEN IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SO -- FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR COMMENTS AROUND THE CONCERN ON THE NCL TAX AND AND AND OUR SUCCESS RATE WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THOSE. TWO IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'RE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY YES OKAY ALL RIGHT SENATOR NELSON. YOU MENTIONED THE A BIT AGO ABOUT EXPANDING ACCESS AND USE TEAM THE GOVERNOR SEEMS TO BE. SENSITIVE TO THAT X. EXPANDED ACCESS IN SOME AREAS. AND THAT WOULD CARRY OVER I TRUST. TO POLICY BILLS THAT ARE MOVING ALONG TO THERE ARE SOME THAT WOULD BE THE CREATING VERY HUGE FUTURE OBLIGATIONS. ALL I WOULD SAY IS I COMMEND YOUR SENSITIVITY TO THAT AS YOU EXPAND ACCESS IN YOUR BUILDING THE BASE FOR THE FUTURE AGAIN THAT'S A QUESTION. ABOUT MOVING AHEAD IN THE FUTURE. AND THE SAME WOULD HOLD TRUE TO WATCH WE JUST HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT. PERSONNEL YEARSAND BEING TEMPORARY OR LONG TERM POSITIONS. IT'S LONG BEEN A DEFLECTION IN OUR BUDGET. THE AGENCIES -- WELL THEY GET HUNGRY FOR MORE PERSONNEL. AND THEIR ANSWER TO EVERY PROBLEM IS MORE P. WEISS -- IT ANOTHER AREA THAT DOES REQUIRE I BELIEVE ATTENTION. AND WITHIN THAT CONTEXT ANOTHER AREA THAT WE'VE LET GET OUT OF CONTROL IT IS NOT BEEN A BUDGET BUSTER BUT IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN A BUDGET PRESSURE. IS ALLOWING ACCRUED ANNUAL LEAVE. THAT IS CASHED OUT. THE BEEN ATTEMPTS. TO THE DOPE CURTAIL THAT A BET. ON THE PAST BUT ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL -- THIS IS AGAIN JUST A PRECAUTION AS WE BUILD OUR BUDGET AND AS WE'VE EVEN HAD THESE VERY DIFFICULT TIMES IN CALIFORNIA DOWN VERY MUCH. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS AN EXAMPLE. SO WE DO HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS IN THESE P. WEISS INCREMENTALLY THEY CAN BE COME BIG PROBLEMS DOWN THE WAY. AND SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER IS ONE OF THEM -- IT'S MAY THIRTIETH AND AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THE CONTROLLER IS BEEN BLAMING IT ON FISCALE -- BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS TO YOU AND YOU HAVE A COMFORTABLE MISS SIR -- ARE YOU ARE YOU CONFIDENT A WATER BALANCE SHEET IS GONNA LOOK LIKE IN. WHEN WE RECEIVE IT BEFORE WE APPROVE A BUDGET? SO I SHE DIED WILL NEED TO CHECK BACK WITH -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE FOLKS IN OUR DEPARTMENT WHO BOTH WORK ON FACE CAL AND ARE IN VERY CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE SO. THAT SOMETHING THAT -- WILL MAKE SURE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON A IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S OVERALL FINANCIAL POSITION AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S MENTIONED. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT IN THE NUMBERS THAT WE PUT OUT IN TERMS OF ARE PROJECTED REVENUES TERMS OF OUR RESERVES WHERE WE THINK THE RAINY DAY FUND WILL BE. AND ARE BROAD ESTIMATE OF SOME OF OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND I KNOW THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT GIVES A MORE PRECISE AND SPECIFIC ESTIMATE OF THOSE -- IN SOME CASES AS OF JUNE OF LAST YEAR -- BUT I'M HAPPY TO CHECK BACK ON THAT AND SEE WHAT THE LATEST IS -- AND OF COURSE THAT IS SOMETHING ULTIMATELY THAT IS UP TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER BUT OUR FOLKS ARE IN VERY CLOSE TOUCH WITH THEM. A GOOD BECAUSE I'D LIKE YOU TO FEEL CONFIDENT -- THE CAP FOR FOR LAST YEAR HAD AN UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE BILLION. AND IF WE ADD TO THAT -- EIGHTY SIX TO NINETY ONE BILLION IN UNFUNDED RETIREE MEDICAL WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO A QUARTER TRILLION. DOLLARS SO IT'S KIND OF ONE THING TO TALK ABOUT A SURPLUS OF TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION BUT WE LOOK AT THE BALANCE SHEET IT'S LIKE. YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LONG WAYS TO GO SO ARE YOU. FEELING COMFORTABLE THAT WERE ADDRESSING THE RETIREE MEDICAL AN INADEQUATE [inaudible] FASHION. SO YES THE STATE DOES HAVE ABOUT PLANS TO PAY DOWN ALL THOSE LIABILITIES ON THE LONG TERM OF COURSE. ALL YOU CAN DO IS STAY AS CLOSE TO THAT PLAN AS POSSIBLE YEAR TO YEAR AND WHEN YOU DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. EVEN MORE WHEN THE PLAN CALLS FOR BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW AS A CPA THESE DISCOUNT RATES THE ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN CAN FLCTUATE OVER TIME. SO WHEN YOU DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE THAN EIGHTY GIVES YOU TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY PUT IN MORE AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES SO SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT TO CALPERS. AND ALSO TO CAL STIRS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S WAS TALKING ABOUT THE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT THEY'RE ALSO PAYMENTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO MAKE. ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BECAUSE THE STATE PORTION OF THE CAL STIRS LIABILITY IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY. SO WE'RE PROPOSING ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A PROPOSITION TWO PAYMENTS IN THIS BUDGET PLUS AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE OUT YEARS AND I BELIEVE THAT ONE POINT ONE BILLION IN. THE BUDGET YEAR IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IS IN CONFERENCE -- FOR THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND WE BELIEVE THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE MANY YEARS AGO AS WE CHIP AWAY AT THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITY. BUT WE DO THINK THAT STEPS LIKE THIS AND I KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF THE ABOUT A ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE OPPOSE STEPS OF THEIR OWN WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE MR PEDICAB. YOU KNOW THAT THEY GET THE COUNTY OF ORANGE WE USED TO GET OUR CAP FOR OUT BY THE END OF DECEMBER -- IT WITH THE JUNIOR RENDON HERE WE ARE ALMOST IN THE JUNE. IN OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDS JUNE THIRTY SIDE IT HAS AT HAVE YOU HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE CONTROLLER AND GETTING ARE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPLETED IN. SENATOR YOU HAVE YOU DONE ANY ANALYSIS OF PITCH CAL AT ALL THAT. WE HAVE A AN ANALYST THAT IS COVERING FISCALE AND WE DO. HAVE SOME WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME INFORMATION FROM THE STATE COMPTROLLER THAT IT IS RELATED TO THE FITZCO -- PROBLEM PROBLEMS THAT THE BEEN HAVING WITH THAT SO -- IT'S AN IT'S ANOTHER ITEM THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK INTO AS WELL. YEAH I GUESS MA'AM CHARM JUST THE ONE I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE AS CENTERS WORKING REALLY HARD ON THEBUDGET WE DON'T GET SURPRISED WITH SOME NUMBERS. AFTER WE FINISH THE BUDGET WHEN WE SEE THE BALLOT SHE CAN GO. WHY WHY WEREN'T WE NOTIFIED SO? IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE THEN WE SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT'S I WANT TO SAY BEING HIDDEN BUT WE JUST DON'T WANT SURPRISES RIGHT SO IF YOU COULD HELP IN THAT REGARD I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I'D LIKE TO ECHO. SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY MR TANG MY BIGGEST FRUSTRATIN WITH THEADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET WAS THE CHARACTERIZATION. OF MANY OF THE EXPENDITURES AS ONE TIME WHEN THEY WERE CLEARLY ONGOING. AND I JUST THINK DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A TRANSPARENT WAY OF APPROACHING. BUDGETING A MISTER TING ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS THAT COULD BE CHARACTERIZED THAT WAY. YEAH I'D LIKE TO ASK SOME OF THE NONPROFIT PROGRAMMATIC ONES FOR EXAMPLE. OF THE ELIMINATION OF SALES TAX ON FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS AND DIAPERS I USED TO QUé BUT A SUNSET ON THAT. NOW THERE'S A SUNSET ON H. OR SAYS READ PROVIDER RATE INCREASES. I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE LIKELY IN TWO YEARS TO BE ROLLED BACK SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT WHY YOU CHARACTERIZE THOSE AS ONE TIME INSTEAD OF ON GOING. SO FOR THE AYE HSS -- THAT SIMILAR TO SOME THE OTHER PROGRAMS TALKED ABOUT WITH MR TANKS AND A WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE FISCAL SITUATION WILL LOOK LIKE IN TWO YEARS AND WHETHER THERE WILL BE. ANY SORTS OF REFORM EFFORTS IN THIS AREA BY THE ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIFICALLY THE FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS AND A DIAPER AT SALES TAX EXEMPTION. THESE ARE NEW MEMBER NEW MEASURES UP PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR SO -- NUMBER ONE AND WE WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OVER THE UPCOMING YEARS BUT NUMBER TWO WE SELL TO THAT IF WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE ADD TO THE DISCUSSION WE WERE HAVING. A MEASURES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING MEMBER THE ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR ARE BEING SUNSET AID DâN AT NEW MEASURES THAT WE'RE PROPOSING BY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE THE ON GOING BROKE MAN BECAUSE GIVEN THE UPDATED MULTI YOUR FORECAST -- UNDER OUR PROJECTIONS WE WEREN'T CONFIDENT THAT WE HAD THE ROOM TO INCLUDE THOSE AS WELL WE THOUGHT LET'S DO IT FOR TWO YEARS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POLICY SOMETHING OFFICE CARE ABOUT. BUT WE CAN REVISIT IT AT THAT TIME IN THAT BUDGET CYCLE. OKAY WELL I MEAN I I THINK THAT. OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THOSE WILL BE ROLLED BACK IN FUTURE LEADER YEARS IS VERY LOW. WHO MAYBE A LITTLE POLITICAL FEASIBILITY? I WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF CHARACTERIZING THAT SO. I THINK IT'S MORE ON IS JUST TO SAY THIS IS THIS IS AN ONGOING EXPENSES NOT A ONE TIME EXPENSE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN. FUTURE YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BALANCE OUR BUDGET CONTINUES TO BE BALANCED I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO SO SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK THAT OUT AS OUR HEARINGS OR CONTINUE. THANK YOU I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT -- EACH IN TERMS OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF A PROGRAM TO SUNSET SOME OF THE MEDI CAL OPTIONAL BENEFITS. THAT WE'VE TRIED FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW TO GET KIND OF BACK IN THE MIX ONE OF THEM IS OPTICAL -- AND I SHARE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUES THAT IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO START TO PROVIDE OPTICAL THAT I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE A SITTING MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE WILL WE STOP IT AGAIN. IT'S SO DEEPLY OFFENSIVE TO ME THAT WE COVER OPTOMETRY WE TELL YOU YOU NEED GLASSES AND THE WE WON'T GIVE YOU THE ACTUAL. CORRECTIVE -- TOOL SO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM ANY OTHER MEMBERS. I ANYTHING EITHER OF YOU TO MORE LIKE TO JUST KIND OF A CLOSE IS A WRAP UP. ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING FORWARD TODAY THANK YOU. WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES WE WILL BE AGAIN. IT'S LIKE THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL WE HAVE OUR NEW. SPIRAL BOUND NOTEBOOK. IT'S ALL PRISTINE CLEAN PAGES AND THAT WON'T LAST LONG YEAH. PAGE ONE OF THE AGENDA. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH. CHILD CARE AND PRE K. THROUGH. TWELVE ITEM. SIXTY ONE HUNDRED STARTING WITH DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. CHILD CARE ACCESS. GOOD MORNING SERRA CORTEZ AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL BEGIN WITH A OVERVIEW OF EARLY EDUCATION ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR BINDERS TODAY -- BUT I'LL JUST PROVIDE SOME HELPFUL CONTACTS FOR ISSUES OF ONE THROUGH.

ON PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUT IS JUST FOR YOUR BACKGROUND SOME HELPFUL CONTACTS ON SOME -- OVERVIEW INFORMATION ON CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. A PAGE THREE YEARS SOME KEY ASPECTS ON THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONSIDER -- SLOW INCREASES TODAY -- SO KEEP A KEY ASPECTS OF THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM JUST FOR BACKGROUND IS THE STATE CONTRACTS WITH ET AGENCIES TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. AND FAMILIES RECEIVE A VOUCHER THEY CAN REDEEM IN ANY SETTING THAT MEETS THE NEEDS -- THAT MEETS OUR CHILD CARE NEEDS. ON AND WITH REGARD TO GENERAL CHILD CARE TO KEEP HIS OF INFORMATION IS THAT THE STATE AWARDS CONTRACTS DIRECTLY TO PROVIDERS. AND THEN FAMILIES WOULD GO TO A LICENSE SETTING WHERE THERE'S A SLOT AVAILABLE THE LAST THING Là HIGHLY ON THIS PAGE IS THAT -- THE RATES FOR THESE TWO PROGRAMS OF THE USE DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURES. ON PAGE FOUR IS ALSO SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THE PROGRAMS WILL CONSIDERING THESE ISSUES OF MULES CONSIDERING THESE ISSUES. AND THEN PAGE FIVE IS WHERE -- WE GET TO SOME OF THE SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE PLANS HERE. SO WITH REGARD TO CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL SLOTS ALL PLANS ADDS SLOTS IN THE NINETEEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY THE GOVERNOR PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION. OFFER A PEACE LOTS THE SENATE -- TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION AND THE ASSEMBLY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION. OF BOTH HOUSES PROVIDE A CHEN ADDITIONAL GENERAL CHILDCARE SLOTS THE GOVERNOR DOES IT PROVIDES LOTS FOR THIS FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE SENATE INCLUDES SEVEN MILLION -- GROWING TO TWENTY NINE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THE ASSEMBLY INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION. IN ALL PLANNED OUT STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS ON THIRTY ONE MILLION FOR TEN THOUSAND STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS. PAGE SIX PROVIDES RICH CHILD CARE A SOME REIMBURSEMENT RATE AUGMENTATIONS PROVIDEDBY BOTH HOUSES OF BOTH HOUSES -- ISSUE WILL HERE LATER TODAY IS THAT THE SENATE PROVIDES A HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE ASUS PROGRAM WAS ASSEMBLY PROVIDESEIGHTY MILLION -- FOR AT FOR THE ACES A FUNDING INCREASE ASUS RATES.

AND THE SENATE ALSO. THIS IS THE SENATE PROVIDE SIX MILLION TO PROVIDE SPECIAL NEEDS ADJUSTMENT FACTOR FOR PARTY STATE PRESCHOOL. I'M PAGE SEVEN SHOWS THE MAJOR ONGOING AUGMENTATIONS -- TWO THINGS THE HIGHLIGHT WOULD BE CAL WORKS STAGE ONE CHILD CARE THERE'S DIFFERENT FUNDING AMOUNTS AND DIFFERENT POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE AMOUNTS. AND THEN -- THERE'S MAJOR ONE TIME FUNDING PROPOSALS THE MAIN ONE IS WITH REGARDS TO KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS -- IN PAGE EIGHT AND NINE IS JUST A SUMMARY TABLE FOR A YOUR RESOURCE. I'M SO THIS CONCLUDES THE OVERVIEW OF THE EARLY EDUCATION BUDGET AND WITH THAT I'M WOULD HAPPY TO GO INTO ISSUE ONE AND MORE THOROUGHLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S GO AHEAD AND START WITH ISSUE ONE I'M SORRY THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE OVERVIEW BEFORE WE START WITH ISSUE. ONE SENATOR MORE LOCK -- YOU DON'T DEFINE WHAT SLOTS MEANS SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF. SOMEONE'S WATCHING. WHO COULD JUST THREW IN A SAID WE'RE NOT USING DOLLAR AMOUNTS COULD SO MAYBE YOU COULD JUST? FOR THE PUBLIC EXPLAIN WHAT IS SLOT. YEP SO FOR PURPOSES OF BUDGETING WE CAN THINK OF A SLOT AS FUNDING AN ADDITIONAL CHILD TO BE SERVED -- IN ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS. AT THE CHAIR. THE TWO JUST OF A PERSON. FOR A KID SPACE FOR CHILD AT SPACE I'M JUST. OKAY THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE OVERVIEW BEFORE WE GET SPECIFIC. WE'LL GO HERE WITH ISSUE ONE CHILD CARE ACCESS. GREAT SO IN ISSUE -- ONE SO WE DIDN'T PROVIDE SOME OF THE SITE INFORMATION ON PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT SO THE MAIN DECISION BEFORE YOU TODAY IS HOW MANY ADDITIONAL SLOTS TO PROVIDE FOR EACH PROGRAM IN THE AND THIS IS THE AP PROGRAM AND THE GENERAL CHILD CARE PROGRAM. SO THERE IS A DEMAND FOR SLOTS -- AS A NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE FAMILIES FAR EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF CURRENTLY FUNDED SLOTS. IF THE COMMITTEE IS INTERESTED IN PROVIDING FAMILIES WITH THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF CHOICE IN SELECTING CHILDCARE PROVIDERS THEN YOU MAY WANT TO PRIORITIZE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT SLOTS. IF THE COMMITTEE IS INTERESTED IN IMMEDIATELY INCREASING ACCESS TO CHILDCARE SLOTS AND YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO FIND MORE HP SLOTS -- IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS TO RAMP UP GENERAL CHILDCARE SLOTS DUE TO THE STATE CONTRACTING PROCESS. ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE COMMITTEE PREFERS THAT INCREASE LOTS BE USE FOR CENTER BASED CARE WITH HIGHER DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS IN MAY WANT TO PRIORITIZE GENERAL CHILDCARE SLOTS. IF THE COMMITTEES INTERESTED IN TARGETING A SPECIFIC AGE GROUPS SUCH AS INFANTS -- YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO PRIORITIZE GENERAL CHILDCARE SLOTS AS A P. AND GENERAL CHILDCARE PROGRAMS BOTH SERVE IN FANS BUT THE STATE HAS A LITTLE MORE ABILITY TO PRIORITIZE BY AGE GROUP IN THE GENERAL CHAIR OCCUR THE GENERAL% CHILD CARE PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACTING PROCESS. THE MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD ASK FOR ANOTHER CLEAR VACATION OF COURSE -- SO REPORT WE WE HAVE SLOTS WE HAVE PROP. SIXTY FOUR WHICH IS [inaudible] MARIJUANA SO. SO YEAH WE ARE A PART FOR SLIDES AND I'M TRYING. TRYING. TRYING TO FIGURE. THE NEXUS. THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH. GOVERNOR BROWN AND HOW WE USE PROP. SIXTY FOUR FOR IN A LOT OF ISSUES TRYING TO GET HOUSING AND INTERNSHIPS FOR DOCTORS INSERT CENTER SO. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE? GET THESE. TOGETHER I DO YOU HAVE A LEGAL OPINION OR ARE THE AUTHORS OF PROP SIXTY FOUR FINE WITH THIS OR WAS THAT PART OF THE INTENTION OF THE BALLOT MEASURE. SO I CAN SPEAK BRIEFLY TO THAT AND IF WE NEED TO FOLLOW UP AFTER WERE HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT FOR THIS BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT TIERS FOR PROPS IT PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IN TERMS OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE FUNDED. AND SO THIS YEAR WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS -- GIVE OR TAKE IN THIS POCKET FOR YOUTH EDUCATION AND PREVENTION EFFORTS -- AND THEN THE ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE INITIATIVE HAS DISCRETION AS LONG AS IT IS ONLINE WITH THAT INTENT THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE FOR YOU KNOW EDUCATION AND PREVENTION OF DRUG ABUSE -- FOR USE SO WE'RE PROPOSING THAT ABOUT 75% OF THAT OR ABOUT 80% -- EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GO TO WORD THE SLOTS AND THIS WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE AN EXPANDING FUNDING SOURCE OVER TIME AS REVENUES INCREASED. AND TO CLARIFY YOUR PROPOSAL THE USES. POTS LOTS FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. IN THAT BRIGHT. JUST GO HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE KNOWN I APOLOGIZE FOR THE CONFUSION ON THAT OURS ARE PROPOSAL WOULD FIND AT EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SLOT. OKAY. GO AHEAD WITH THE MORE LIKE I'M SORRY AND AND AND AND SO AREN'T REAL THAT THE ISSUE WHEN IT IS CHILD CARE ACCESS SO I EIGHTY MILLION [inaudible] DOLLARS. I'M STILL TRYING TO GET THE NEXUS ARE WE WERE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT TEACHING [inaudible] TODDLERS [inaudible] ABOUT. EDUCATION ON HOW TO USE OR NOT USE CERTAIN. I KNOW SENATOR FOR THIS MONEY WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THAT THESE ARE FUNDING SLOTS WITH THE BELIEF THAT WHEN WE PUT AN EMPHASIS ON THESE TYPES ON THIS TYPE OF CHILD CARE BEING OF IT I'M SORRY THESE TEXAS WHAT'S BEING AVAILABLE. AND THAT WILL REDUCE -- DRUG ABUSE IN THE FUTURE AND THAT'S THE ONE THE INTENTIONS OF THE PROPOSITION. DO WE HAVE A SCIENTIFIC STUDY. FOR SOMETHING THAT. PROVIDES THE NEXUS OR OR OR IS THIS A STRETCH AND TO HELP ME OUT I SO THE LANGUAGE INCLUDED IN PROP SIXTY FOUR AND FIVE CALLS OUT SPECIFIC AND GENERAL THINGS THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT ON INCLUDING THINGS LIKE SCHOOL RETENTION. AND SO WE'RE PUTTING OUT THE SLIDES AND A LOT OF THESE TALKS ARE GONNA GO TO AMUSE ZERO THROUGH ALWAYS ZERO THREE THIRTEEN AND CAN BE USED FOR THINGS LIKE AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER TIME FUNDING -- AND PROVIDING EVEN OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN -- ACCESS TO STABLE CARE THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO IT THAT IS DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE THAT WILL ALLOW THEM AND TO HAVE THAT STABILITY MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MR MCCARTY FOLLOWED BY MR OBERNOLTE JUST A QUICK QUESTION IN IN FOLLOWING UP ON MISTER MORLOCKS POINT -- FOR IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S UNCLEAR BASED ON THE PROPOSITION WHETHER OR NOT THESE FUNDS -- MAY BE PROGRAM TO THE BUDGET PROCESS -- DO YOU. DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION OR FEEL DIFFERENTLY. SO THE PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDS CITY ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL ON THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS NOW. IT HAPPENS A DECADE OR SO DOWN THE ROAD BUT RIGHT NOW -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTERPRETATION OF THE PROPOSITION IS THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROGRAM BE SPECIFIC FUNDS -- SO LONG AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSITION AS WE WERE DISCUSSING. THOUGHT MOVEMENT IN THIS INTO THE TABLES WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE LA -- AS WELL HI HOW INTERESTING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS SOME LACK OF CLARITY ON EXACTLY HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE CAN DIRECT THESE TO THE FUNDS. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE ONE IS THAT THE FUNDS ARE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS THERE'S ALSO SOME LANGUAGE IN THE MEASURE THAT -- THAT THAT -- LMITS THE AUTHORITY POTENTIALLY -- OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ADJUST ALLOCATIONS TO PROGRAMS -- UP THROUGH THE NEXT ABOUT ROUGHLY ALMOST TEN YEARS -- AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS I THINK THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY SO WHAT IS AN ALLOCATION TO A PROGRAM IS THAT HAVE SPECIFIC IS THAT -- AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHERE pLEGAL GRAY AREA SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CERTAINLY -- CONCERT TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL ON IF THEY'RE FURTHER QUESTIONS BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE WHERE THERE'S POTENTIALLY SOME LEGAL UNCERTAINTY THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR EXPERIENCE WITH PROP TEN FOR EXAMPLE ANOTHER IS THAT THAT WE WERE VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAD -- APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY. YEAH I THINK THERE'S LESS CLARITY HERE THAN IN IN SOME OTHER AREAS BECAUSE OF THAT BUT CERTAINLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONTINUE TO EXPLORE AND WE THINK THERE'S A STRONG ROLE FOR OVERSIGHT. AND CERTAINLY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THESE ALLOCATIONS REGARDLESS. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY. THANK YOU I I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES HERE RIGHT PEOPLE WITH THE AFTER SCHOOL PIECE -- AND I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE IS THAT THE JANUARY BUDGET DIDN'T FOCUS ON CHILD CARE SO MUCH HAD PRESCHOOL ACCESS AND SO. PLEASE AT THE MAY REVISE IN THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY ALL PRIORITIZE INCREASING CHILD CARE ACCESS SO THAT'S A BIG POSITIVE AND IT'S AN FOR SAID THEY WERE KIND OF PITTING AFTER SCHOOL VERSES. CHILD CARE BUT I THINK THE FIRST THING IS THAT I WANT TO CLARIFY APPROACH TO ADDRESS TO TO SUMMER MITCHELL SO THE FIRST PRPOSAL. IT WAS BROUGHT AS FAR AS WHAT THE SIXTY SIXTY FOUR MONTHS AGO TO AND THEN YOU CLARIFY THAT WOULD GO. TO THAT THE VOUCHER PROGRAM AND YOU'RE SAYING ZERO THREE THIRTEEN BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS MOST KIDS. MOST MOST MOST THE VOUCHER PROGRAM THE DOCTOR PROGRAM WOULD GO [inaudible] TO YOUNGER KIDS. ZERO THREE FIVE RIGHT. THAT IS NOT A THAT IS NOT CORRECT FOR ALL OF OUR VOUCHER PROGRAM SO IT REALLY DEPENDS UPON THE THE AGE RANGE OF THE CHILDREN SERVE REALLY DEPENDS UPON -- EITHER THE CAL WORKS STAGE THAT THEY'RE IN -- OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE IN A CAL WORKS VOUCHER PROGRAM -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS FOR LIKE OUR STAGE THREE PROGRAMS AND OUR ARE A P. PROGRAM -- THERE ACTUALLY ARE QUITE A LARGE PORTION OF THE POPULATION THAT'S BEING SERVED THAT IS AGES SIX TO THIRTEEN OKAY MYBE A LARGE BUT IT ARE THERE MORE THAT ARE BELOW. FIVE FOR EXAMPLE FIVE NO THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING I I CAN PULL UP IN PROVIDER OFFICE WITH THE EXACT PERCENTAGES BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH YOU RIGHT NOW BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN SERVED AT LEAST. IN THOSE PROGRAMS -- ARE OF THE SCHOOL AGE OKAY I WITH MY EXPERIENCE TO RUN IN ONE THAT THEIR YOUNGER NOW. AND THEN -- WILL EITHER WAY ALL HOUSES ABOUT TWO HOUSES IN THE GOVERNOR WENT TO PRIORITIZE ABOUT JUST LOTS OF THAT THAT'S A GIVEN AND TO THE HOUSES ONE OF FOCUS ON AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS LATER ON I I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT. WE CAN YOU KNOW GO BACK AND WORK BUT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT YOUR HONORING THE WILL OF OTHERS. IS VERY CLEAR WHEN THEY WROTE THIS PROP SIXTY FOUR THE WITH BY THE GOVERNOR IN THE BALLOT ARGUMENT IT SAID. TAX REGULATE. MARIJUANA CAN USE THAT MONEY IS TO FOCUS ON PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THEY DID MENTION CHILD CARE PROGRAMS WERE PLAYING IN THE GENERAL FUND. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR TV COMMERCIAL [inaudible] PRETTY SIMPLE. LEADING LADY IN WEST LOT OF REAL ESTATE HERE [inaudible] CRYSTAL CLEAR. FUNDS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS I DIDN'T SEE THE COMMERCIAL CHILD CARE PROGRAM SO. I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE INTELLECTUALLY HONEST WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HONORING. THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AND I THINK THIS IS BEING YOU KNOW TOO CUTE BY HALF. A FEW MONTHS AFTER THIS MEASURE IS FINALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED SO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT. IN CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE ALONG THE PROCESS [inaudible] THIRTY NIELSEN [inaudible] RUSSIAN ANALYST. CANNABIS REBEL TAX REVENUES OF THE NOT BEEN QUITE WHAT WAS EXPECTED. OF A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOUGHT THE GRAVY TRAIN WAS COMING. AND IT APPEARS THAT TO AN AWFUL LOT OF THOSE TAXES ARE BEING AVOIDED. ISN'T THAT OCCURRED TO ME THE CONCERNED WHEN I FIRST READ THIS I SAID WHAT WE'RE BASING THIS ON THESE REVENUES BUT SO FAR. IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION THAT SIXTY FIVE WE'VE NOT SEEN THE THE BONANZA THAT WAS EXPECTED FROM TAXES FROM. MARIJUANA HAVE WE SO I THINK THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A LACK OF CERTAINTY ON WHAT THESE REVENUES WOULD BE PARTICULARLY IN THE EARLY YEARS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- OUR OFFICE IS NOTED -- IN THE PAST IS THAT SUCH A WITH A NEW INDUSTRY THAT'S RAMPING UP -- THERE'S JUST A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ON REVENUE SO YES -- I YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT THE REVENUE TO COME AND I'M SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN THAN THE ADMINISTRATION ORIGINALLY. ANTICIPATED -- BUT IT'S I THINK UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHERE WE THINK THAT THAT ONE I THINK THAT THAT ESTIMATES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S COME FORWARD WITH ARE PROBABLY IN THE REASONABLE RANGE ON AND TWO I THINK THAT THERE'S A LACK OF CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE ULTIMATE REVENUES MIGHT BE AND CERTAINLY THEY MAY. WILL GROW OVER TIME -- SO I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO PROTECT. HI CLINT COME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST TO CLARIFY TO WE ESTIMATED -- TO THIS EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S GOING TO CHILD CARE SLOTS WAS PREMISED ON TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF TAX REVENUE BEING -- RECEIVED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE JUST RECEIVED A TOWARD A THIRD QUARTER TAX PAYENT THAT IS TRAINING IN LINE WITH OUR ESTIMATE AND ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY ABOVE SO WE DO HAVE SOME EVIDENCE THAT. THIS SHOULD BE A FAIRLY ACCURATE AMOUNT. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY THANK YOU. MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY. ECHO BY AGREEMENT WITH MISTER MCCARTY'S COMMENTS ON THE PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDING. I THINK WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT WHEN WE TELL VOTERS ONE THING AND THEY APPROVE SOMETHING AND THEN WE DO ANOTHER THEIR A LOT LESLIE LESS LIKELY TO TRUST US THE NEXT TIME WE GO TO THEM ASKING FOR THEIR APPROVAL FOR SOMETHING SO. I THINK THAT THE I STRONGLY SUPPORT WITH THE ASSEMBLY IS DONE IN THAT RESPECT WE'VE ALSO WE'VE WE HAVE A LOT OF FUNDING -- FOR THE THE SLOTS BUT WE USED TO PROP SIXTY FOUR MONEY FOR THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHICH I THINK IS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU MISTER TING IN THE NUMBER OF WEIGHING IN ON THE AFTER SCHOOL VERSUS AP FLASHPOINT MYSELF MR TING. THANK YOU TO STONE. IT'S JUST A QUICK COMMENT REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PUTTING IN -- MONEY. FOR KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES SOMETHING THAT HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH OF A BIG FAN OF I THINK ONE THING. THAT -- SORT OF CHANGE AT LEAST ON MY THINKING WAS ALEJO'S TESTIMONY AND SENT TO THIS YEAR. REGARDING. WHAT DISTRICTS HAD ACTUALLY USED THE KINDERGARTEN FACILITY FUNDING AND ALSO WHAT DISTRICTS? NEED KINDERGARTEN FACILITY FUNDING AS WELL AS WHICH DISTRICTS HAVE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN WHICH ONES DON'T AND I THINK MY ASSUMPTION BEFORE A GO IN THIS PRESENTATION WAS THAT MANY OF THE DISTRICTS IN NEED WERE THE ONES THAT -- HAD NOT MOVE TOWARD FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN WHERE HE WAS. BASED ON THE LA ANALYSIS THAT ACTUALLY HE WAS IN FACT THE OPPOSITE WHERE. DISTRICTS THAT WERE IN THE MORE AFFLUENT AREAS WERE THE ONES WHO PURPOSELY DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BECAUSE THEY COULD HAVE PEOPLE PICK UP THEIR KIDS AT NOON -- UNLIKE OTHER OTHER AREAS WHERE YOU HAD TO GET A WORKING FAMILIES WHO REALLY NEEDED -- FULL DAY. SCHOOL SO -- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE ENDED UP. DOING CUTTING THAT NUMBER A PARTICULAR -- BECAUSE WE FELT THAT -- THERE WASN'T AS MUCH OF A NEED AS WE HAD THOUGHT. AND PUTTING SOME OF THAT MONEY MORE TOWARD ONGOING SLOT SUCH AS WANTING FELLOW COULD JUST AGAIN SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THAT ANALYSIS THEY DID REGARDING -- THE KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES AND WHERE THE MONEY IT WAS GOING AS WELL AS HER THAT THE NEED. BEHIND -- WHO ACTUALLY? MAKE CHOICES AROUND FOR THE KINDERGARTEN VERSUS VERSUS NOT FOLKS CAMILLA [inaudible] WHAT? WITH THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE I'M SO WE DO JUST WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT WE WILL BE SPEAKING ON FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN ON ISSUE. NINE BUT FOR THE TIME BEING. WOULD YOU MIND JUST READ THE QUESTION REALLY QUICKLY SURE JUST. I THOUGHT THE THE PRESENTATION YOU MADE IN SUBCOMMITTEE WAS I THINK THEY'RE INTERESTING WHAT ONE OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS GOING INTO THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AS WAS GOING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WAS -- ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE HAVE SUCH A DIFFICULT TASK WITH PRESCHOOL SLOTS. IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WAS REALLY BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FACILITIES WE HOPE THAT HAVING MORE CONSTRUCTION OF KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS AND ALSO ASSISTED THE PRESCHOOL UPTICK. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT HAVING SAID THAT I THINK. YOUR ANALYSIS OF WHAT DISTRICTS ACTUALLY. DIDN'T HAVE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND WHAT WHAT DISTRICTS I'M MORE SORT OF ACTUALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE KINDERGARTEN FACILITY MONEY WAS I THINK YOU KNOW VERY INTERESTING AND AND ALSO CHANGE OUR THINKING. AROUND THIS WHICH IS WHY WE ENDED P LOWERING THE GOVERNOR'S NUMBER A LITTLE BIT AND PUTTING SOME MORE MONEY TOWARDS SLOTS. SO IF YOU COULD JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH WHAT. A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU FOUND. IN TERMS OF WHO. WHAT? WHO'S NOT PARTICIPATING IN FOR THE KINDERGARTEN -- WHO IS ACTUALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES -- GRANTSGET AGAIN WE ONE MILLION SO PRESCRIBED. BUT THEN ALSO -- IDENTIFYING WHETHER OR NOT THE MOST NEEDY DISTRICTS ARE IN FACT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THOSE FUNDS SURE OF COURSE. I THINK YOUR MOSTLY REFERENCING THE INITIAL ONE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN THOUGHT. I FOR KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANTS LAST YEAR -- SOONER UNDERSTANDING HAVE WITH THEIR FIRST ROUND OF APPLICATIONS. EIGHT BECAUSE OF HOW THEIR PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED A LOT OF THE GRANTS AND IT'S GOING TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY RUNNING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND I'M IN TERMS OF TARGETING THOSE GRANTS TOWARDS. LOW INCOME DISTRICT THAT ARE RUNNING PART DAY KINDERGARTEN WE FOUND THAT MOST OF THE DISTRICTS RUNNING PART DAY KINDERGARTEN IN THE STATE ARE ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT HIGHER INCOME -- IN SO WAY THAT STRESS PART OF CONSIDERATION AS A LEGISLATURE DECIDES -- TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW IT WENT TO STRUCTURE THE GRANT PROGRAM MOVING ON I THINK THE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE FOUND WHERE THEY WERE SEVERAL -- OTHER CONSTRAINTS DISTRICTS FACE WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO RUN PER DAY VERSUS FULL DAY KINDERGARTN AND MOST OF THOSE WERE NOT NECESSARILY RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRAINTS -- WE FOUND THAT FIRST. OUR FRIENDS PLAYED INTO THE DECISION AS TO WHAT DISTRICTS WOULD RUN SOME PARENTS JUST HAVE FOR THEIR CHILD'S ATTEND A SHORTER DAY PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE. THAT A LONGER PROGRAM IS NOT A SUIT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS THAT YOUNG. A SECOND -- PART OF THIS WAS TEACHER PREFERENCE SO SOME TEACHERS JUST PREFERRED HAVE PART DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS AND THESE TEACHERS MAY GO ON TO PROVIDE OTHER AND SECTION ON AN INJECTION DURING OTHER PARTS OF THE DAY SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY MIGHT TEACH SCIENCE. OR MATH TWO OLDER KIDS OR THEY MIGHT BE PULLING STUDENTS OUT FROM OTHER CLASSROOMS FOR INTENSIVE READING -- INTERVENTIONS AND THEN A THIRD ISSUE THAT WE FOUND WAS SOME DISTRICTS HAD CHALLENGES FINDING A ON GOING SOURCE FOR STAFF FUNDING IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL STAFF THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. TO CONVERT AND RUN FULL DAY PROGRAMS AND SO AN OVERALL WE FOUND THAT. WHEN HE CAME? TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE RUNNING PART DAY KINDERGARTEN THAT PICTURE IS REALLY JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLEX THAN JUST FACILITIES ALONE. THANK YOU SO CELLS LIKE. WITH THAT ANALYSIS IT WASN'T THAT. DISTRICTS WHO WERE -- NOT DOING DISTRICTS WERE DOING PART TIME CAN CARDS HAS LIKE A LOT THAT WAS BY CHOICE IT WASN'T NECESSARILY. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF RESOURCES OR CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS. THAT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- I I I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS FUNDED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND I'VE ALWAYS YOU KNOW. FELT IT WAS UNFORTUNATE WHEN WE ALLOWED ONE GROUP ONE SERVICE OFFERING TO BE PITTED AGAINST THE OTHER I THINK I WOULD JUST PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT I APPRECIATE. THE PROP -- SIXTY FOUR PROPONENTS ADVERTISE AN AFTER SCHOOL BUT I THINK SOMETIMES WE GET CAUGHT UP IN SEMANTICS THERE'S A WHOLE POPULATION OF WORKING PARENTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF PICKING THEIR CHILDREN UP BY SIX O'CLOCK. WHO ALSO DON'T WORK JUST MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AND SO THE BENEFIT OF THE A. P. SLOT PROGRAM IS THOSE ARE AFTER SCHOOL SETTINGS FOR SCHOOL AGE KIDS -- THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF A WORKING PARA A BUS DRIVER WHO WORKS TO ELEVEN AT NIGHT -- OR THOSE WHO WORK VERY WILL SCHEDULE THE MAY WORK WEEKENDS AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL BASED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS CALLED AT SIX AND AREN'T OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS SO I FULLY APPRECIATE THE NOTION OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT PROP SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS ARGUES FOR ABOUT. THIS BUT I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY THAT THAT I THINK WILL WE SAY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WE ENVISION ALL SORTS OF MAKER PROGRAM THAT MAY BE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OR SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS THAT IN THAT. SIX AND THE VALUE OF THE A. P. PROGRAM IS IT CAN MEET THE NEED OF A BROADER POPULATION PARENTS AND IT ALSO AFFORDS. FOR CHOICE IN TERMS OF THE SETTING THAT MEETS THEIR WORK SCHEDULE THEIR LIFE AND THEIR CHILDREN'S NEEDS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ON ISSUE. ONE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OUT ADAM OPEN PENDING CONFERENCE COMPROMISE MOVING ON TO ISSUE TO STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS AND ELIGIBILITY. THE KEY DECISION BEFORE YOU IS WITH REGARDS TO ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE PRESCHOOL IS ALL PLANT -- ALL PLANS PROVIDED THIRTY ONE MILLION FOUR TEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS SO JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND CURRENTLY ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PART DAY PORTION OF THE PROGRAM BUT THE FULL DAY PROGRAM IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR THOSE THAT MEET THE WORK. REQUIREMENTS. THE GOVERNOR INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REMOVE THE WORK REQUIREMENT FOR PARENTS TO BE WORKING OR IN SCHOOL TO BE -- OR IN SCHOOL TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FULL DAY PROGRAM. THE SENATE AMENDS -- THAT WERE REMAINS AT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BY PROVIDING PRIORITY TO A FULL TIME SLOTS FOR WORKING. PARENTS IN THOSE ATTENDING SCHOOL -- IN THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTS THE GOVERNOR'S LANGUAGE BUT ALSO A MEN'S ELIGIBILITY EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO INCLUDE ALL FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN A SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AREA WERE 80% OR MORE STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. OF FOR THIS ACTION WE RECOMMEND THE SENATE WE PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE ACCESS TO WORKING FIVE ACCESS TO THE FULL DAY PROGRAM FOR WORKING FAMILIES. AND THE SENATE OPTION WOULD AT LEAST ENSURE THAT WORKING FAMILIES GETS FIRST CALLED THE SLOTS THE FULL DAYS LOTS RIGHT. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THURMOND. GERMAN JUST A CLARIFICATION -- IF REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT FOR PARENTS TO BE WORKING OR IN SCHOOL WHAT. WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE? THAT I WOULD THINK THAT PART OF THE CONCERN THAT THAT WE HAD WITH THE PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW THE THE WAY THAT THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IS DESIGNED IS WE WANT LOW INCOME CHILDRENTO HAVE ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SO WE GIVE ALL LOW INCOME FAMILIES ACCESS TO THAT PROGRAM. WHETHER THAT'S CAM AT THE VERY LEAST THE PARTY THREE HOUR PROGRAM. I THINK THERE ARE. THERE IS SOME INTEREST IN IT THERE'S BEEN SOME INTERESTING PROVIDING I THINK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THIS PROGRAM TO BE LARGER OR LONGER DURING THE DAY I THINK THE WAY THAT WE ARE AT THE STATE. PRIORITIZING OUR LIMITED RESOURCES IN THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE WE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING FOR ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN IS TO SAY LOW INCOME FAMILIES. WHERE -- WHERE THERE IS SOMEBODY AVAILABLE FOR CARE YOU CAN USE THOSE THE PARTY PROGRAM IF YOU HAVE PARENTS WORKING OR IN SCHOOL AND THERE'S NOBODY AVAILABLE FOR CAN YOU CAN BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FULL DAY? WE THINK THAT THAT'S A REASONABLE WAY TO PRIORITIZE THE WAY THAT WE USE OUR FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKING PARENTS STILL HAVE ARE ARE ABLE TO PUT THEIR CHILD IN A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT ALSO PROVIDES CHILDCARE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. BUT OUR CONCERN WITH WITH MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. SO MAYBE IF I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- I'M I'M A STUDENT SO I NEED. MY CHILD TO BE TAKEN CARE OF BUT I'M ONLY IN CLASS IN THE MORNING BUT I I NEED THE AFTERNOON TO DO THE READING OF THE WRITING AND GET BY. ASSIGNMENTS DONE SO I STILL COULD USE FROM CHILD CARE IS THAT. WHAT WE'RE SAYING? I'M JUST GONNA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE PURPOSE BEHIND ELIMINATING THE WORK REQUIREMENT I THINK IS IS SEVERAL FOLD SO FIRST IT'S DEFINITELY A PRIORITY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. TO INSURE -- ACCESS TO A LONGER -- PRESCHOOL DAY -- AS WE ARE EXPANDING -- AND WORKING TOWARDS THE GOAL THIS ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS EVENTUALLY UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL -- WE FIND THAT THERE ARE MANY DEVELOPMENTAL BENEFITS TO A LONGER PRESCHOOL DAY I THINK THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS. TO THE EXTENT THAT -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO ACCESS THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. IT CAN BE A BARRIER -- TO HAVE ONLY A THREE HOUR PROGRAM FOR THOSE FAMILIES ESPECIALLY IF TRANSPORTATION IS AN ISSUE. SO I THINK THATONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS OPENING UP -- TO OF A FULL DAY PROGRAM TO PROVIDE -- YOU KNOW MORE ACCESS TO FAMILIES WHO OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE. TO TO UTILIZE THESE PROGRAMS. WHO? CAN AFFORD TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S ONLY THREE HOURS A DAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR THAT'S WEBER. YES I I AM I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I THINK -- ELIMINATE THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRES IS POINTING UP TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE WORK REQUIREMENTS REALLY REST ON WHAT'S BEST FOR THE CHILD. MUCH MORE THAN WHAT'S BEST FOR ALWAYS THE ADULT AND OF COURSE WE FEEL A LOT OF THE NEEDS OF THE ADULTS BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS AND WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- WORKING TOWARD A PRESCHOOL FOR ALL. AND AND IT WOULD NOT BE CONTINGENT UPON WHETHER ANYONE HAD A JOB WITH WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SERVE. AND I THINK THAT BECOMES EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR PRESCHOOL EFFORTS. I'M PLEASED THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE IDEA THAT ANYONE WHO LIVES IN THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITY ALSO HAS ACCESS TO IT BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACED A FEW YEARS AGO WAS THAT MANY OF US HAD EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FOR US. WHO COULD NOT AFFORD TOP HERE WHO COULD NOT AFFORD PRESCHOOL IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE ANNE AND THEY WERE PEOPLE MAKING FIFTY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR? BUT WHEN YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO PAY A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR CHILDCARE FOR PRESCHOOL THAT'S IT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE SO I HAVE STAFF WHO COULD NOT AFFORD. TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO DECENT PRESCHOOLS AND THAT'S UNFRTUNATE BECAUSE WE WORKING ON ALL THE PRESCHOOL EFFORTS WE COULD DO IT. GETTING SLOTS FOR THOSE WITHOUT A INCOME AND SO IF WE COULD GO SO IT WAS ALMOST A DISINCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FOR PRESCHOOL. AND SO I THINK CHANGING THOSE ELIGIBILITY SO THOSE WHO LIVE IN THAT COMMUNITY MAKING IT AVAILABLE TO THEM WILL IT MAKES AVAILABLE TO TO ALMOST NOT EVERYONE BUT SURELY OF A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO WE THINK WE'RE FUNDING BUT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE NOT BECAUSE OF THE LOWER? INCOME REQUIREMENT THAT WAS THERE AND SO THOSE FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES MANY OF THEM THE WORKING POOR COULD NOT AFFORD TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO A DECENT PRESCHOOL. AND I THINK THAT IN ITSELF WAS A TRAGEDY WITH ALL THE EFFORTS WE WERE DOING AB ONE MEMBER OF MY STAFF WAS A STRONG DVOCATE THE PRESCHOOL AND HE WAS AT ALL THE MEETINGS AND HELPING US THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. AND SHE WAS NOT ELIGIBLE OF FOR ANY SUPPORT TO PUT A KID THERE AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO SEND A CHILD TO DECENT PRESCHOOL. THAT WAS TRAGIC INSIDE I'M PLEASE IT WOULD LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE IDEA OF THE 80% IN TERMS OF BILLS IN THE COMMUNITY AND MAKING THOSE INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. SENATOR NIELSEN FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THIRTY NIELSEN I APPRECIATED YOUR RESPONSE AND THE LOGIC I WILLING TO ENTERTAIN SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT IT BUT WITH A CAUTION. WHEN THIS CHILD CARE THING BECAME A BIG DEAL IN THE EIGHTIES WITH THE ADVENT OF THE GAIN PROGRAM WHICH THEN BECAME CAL WORKS? ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PREMISES. IT WAS THAT. THE INDIVIDUAL ON THIS WOULD BE THE PARENT. WAS ON THE TRACK TOWARDS IMPROVING EMPLOYABILITY IT WASN'T WORK FOR IT WASN'T GET A JOB IT WAS AND PROVE YOUR WORKING SKILLS. AND I'D HATE TO SEE THAT KIND OF DYNAMIC REMOVED FROM ANYTHING THAT WE'RE GOING FORWARD AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THIS THIS MAY BE A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY OBLIGATION AND I WOULD SAY NOT JUST WORK BUT BE ATTENDING SOME KIND OF UP THE SCHOOLING. OR CAREER TECH SKILLS TO DEVELOP YOUR EMPLOYABILITY THAT DOES NEED TO GO HAND IN HAND. AM JUST CLARIFICATION AND YOU KNOW ALL NO I'M NOT GOING TO THIS THE WHOLE -- CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BUT THIS IS A THOUGHT MY NORMAL FROM ABOUT -- THAT'S THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM TO JIM NIELSEN YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOES HELP YOU KNOW IT IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO WORK REQUIREMENTS JOB REQUIREMENTS IN SCHOOL -- STATE PRESCHOOL HAS A HISTORY LONGER THAN THAN THE GAME PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW THE THE STATE GOT INVOLVED IN THE CHILD CARE BUSINESS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ASKED WOMEN TO GO TO WORK IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR. AND SO THE AP PROGRAM AND AND STATE PRESCHOOL DATES BACK THERE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ASKED WOMEN TO GO TO WORK AND SO IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THE PROGRAM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WILL HIT LATER. IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM WHERE THOSE -- HOURS IN ELIGIBILITY STILL DIRECTLY LINKED TO YOUR WORK AND JOB REQUIREMENTS. MOVING ON TO MISTER MCCARTY. YEAH THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON THEM THE ELVES ELIGIBILITY SO WE HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY HERE AND OF COURSE IN THEOUT YEARS TAKE A GROSS FOR THE TEN THOUSAND SLOTS. THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE THE ASSEMBLY REALLY ADDRESSES TWO ISSUES ONE AS AS DOCTOR WEBER NOTED. THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN HIGH COST AREAS OR BECAUSE OF JUST THE LGBT RATES. THEY'RE THEY'RE TOO RICH TO GET THE FREE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM BUT THEY'RE TOO POOR TO PAY. UC BERKELEY RATES TO GO TO A FULL DAY PRESCHOOL WHICH IS. DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE BETWEEN LITERALLY ONE IN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH AND SO I THINK THAT'S WERE TRYING TO GET. AND ALSO IS NOT JUST THE TEN THOUSAND SLOTS FOR THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AFTER THE ENTIRE. HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS FOR FOR FAMILIES A LOT OF AMMAR AND ELLIE ACE AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO SEND. THE MONEY BACK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND SOMEBODY IN THAT CERTAIN INCOME BRACKET. BUT THERE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IN A HIGH POVERTY NEIGHBORHOODS TO MAYBE MAKE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR ARE THEY RICH WITH A HOUSING COSTS PROBABLY NOT COULD THE BENEFIT FROM UTILIZING THAT. STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT'S THERE WITH LOSING THEM THE SLOT BACK. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ADD OVER HERE ON N. STREET. SO THAT'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW NOT SUPER EFFICIENT SO. THIS ADDRESSES BOTH THOSE AND GETS TO THE POINT WHERE ONE DAY WE LIKE TO HAVE. UNIVERSAL BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE SHOULD FOCUS ON I TARGETED UNIVERSALISM AND FOCUSED ON THE KIDS WHO NEED THE MOST AND KIDS WHO ARE IN THOSE AREAS. WHICH COULD BENEFIT SOME OF THAT SO -- THAT SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON FOR YOU TO STAY PRESCHOOL. SEEN THEM THANK YOU REMOVE WANT ISSUE THREE CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL RATES. BOTH HOUSES PROVIDER RATE INCREASE -- GRAY INCREASES IN THEIR PLAN BUT FOR DIFFERENT PROVIDERS SO THE SENATE PROVIDES EIGHTY FIVE MILLION TO INCREASE THE HOURLY RATES OF LICENSE EXAM PROVIDERS AND THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE PROVIDERS ON THE VOUCHER PROGRAM AND ALSO FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO INCREASE -- TIP TO PROVIDE AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION ADJUSTMENT FACTOR FOR STATE FOR PARTY CITY PRESCHOOL. THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES FORTY FIVE MILLION -- IN NINETEEN TWENTY GROWING TO EIGHTY MILLION ON GOING FUNDING IN -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE TOWARDS INCREASING RATES UNDER A NEW SINGLE REIMBURSEMENT REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM -- THE REGARDING THE ASSEMBLY ACTIONS WE THINK THE GENERAL IDEA OF MOVING TOWARDS A ONE RATE SYSTEM IS WORTH A WILD -- GIVEN THE COME GIVEN THE CHILD CARE TAX SYSTEMS COMPLEX WERE A REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURES -- THE ONE THING WE WOULD NOTE IS THAT THE TARGET RATE SET FORTH BY THIS PROPOSED BY THIS PROPOSAL ARE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN UNDER CURRENT LAW -- ADVOCATES ESTIMATE -- OUT IN THE TOTAL FUNDING WOULD BE UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ROUGHLY HALF OF WHICH WOULD BE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. THANK YOU QUESTIONS ON ISSUE. THREE THREE MORE UP. TO DATE. DEFINITIONAL CLARIFICATION NOW WE'RE USING THE TERM RATES. SO HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO SLOTS. THAT'S WHAT YOU PLATE WITH IS WHAT WE PAY FOR THE FLAT. YEAH I'M JUST. MAYBE SOMEONE TO WATCH AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP OUT. IT'S WHAT WE PAY FOR THE SLOTS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC ON HIS TV SET A MARK OF MORE LIKE BUT IT'S WHAT WE PAY. AND AND THE NOTION OF THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE VERSUS THE RETAIL MARKET RATE IT'S THE DIFFERENT RATE SYSTEMS BASED ON THE THE PLACE OF THE CARE BE A FAMILY DAYCARE OR A CENTER BASED CARE [inaudible] ANY QUESTIONS. MOVING ON TO ISSUE FOR CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION ONE TIME FACILITIES INVESTMENT. THEGOVERNOR PROVIDES TWO AND FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR A FACILITY OFFICIALLY GRANT PROGRAM -- BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED AS BUDGETED -- BUT THE SENATE -- WHAT THEY DIFFER ON WITH REGARDS THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DIRECTING HOW THE FUNDS MUST BE SPENT THE SENATE SET ASIDE EIGHT SETS ASIDE BY PERCENT OF FUNDS TO HELP CURRENT PROVIDERS ME LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND THE SEVEN THE ASSEMBLY ALLOWS CD TO USE UP 25% OF FUNDS TO CONTRACT WITH? FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO GRANTEES. ON THE ASSEMBLY ALSO INCLUDES ADDITIONAL GRANT FUNDING BY USING FUNDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR A FACILITIES LONG PROGRAM -- AND THE SEEM REASONABLE USE OF THE FUNDING. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. I CLEARLY COLLEGE THIS IS OUR FIRST RUN THROUGH OF THE BINDER AND SO WE WILL BE TAKING ACTIONS IT'S ONE TO MAKE ONE COMMENT YES PLEASE FIND AND SO -- WE APPRECIATE THE APPROVAL -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST IN THIS AREA -- WOULD YOU WANT TO MAKE A POINTABOUT SOME OF THAT -- SPECIFICALLY THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- FOR WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORKLOAD THAT COULD CREATE -- AND ESPECIALLY -- IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE CHANGES TO ALIGN THE USE OF THE FUNDING WITH A BEFORE FIFTY TWO NOT BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PRIORITIZING AND THIS WILL COME UP PERHAPS A COUPLE OTHER TIMES TODAY. IS THE MASTER PLAN ON EARLY LEARNING AND CARE -- WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S MAKING A PRIORITY AND LOOKING AT THE WHOLE CHILD CARE SPACE -- AS YOU NOTED MADAM CHAIR OFTEN IN THIS AREA GROUPS ARE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER SO WE DO ONE AT ZOOM OUT AND TAKE A REAL STRATEGIC LOOK AT THIS. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS LANGUAGE WHEN ADOPTED DOES NOT CONSTRAIN -- THE ABILITY -- A FOR THE GOVERNOR AND WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT THAT -- IN ONE PIECE. THANK YOU WITH THAT HAS THE ASSEMBLY IS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CAN EDUCATION HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR WORK. IT WAS DONE. YES WE HAVE THANK YOU. ALRIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT. YES I DIDN'T WANT TO PASS UP ON THE PROPOSAL IT'S IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY. THE LOAN VERSES THE GRANT THAT SOMETHING WE HAD HEARD ON THE PRIOR REVOLVING LOAN FUND THAT. THE IT JUST WASN'T AS SUCCESSFUL AS FAR AS THE LONE SO. IS THAT SOMETHING I KNOW YOU YOU KNOW WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THAT THE MASTER PLAN BUT THE NOTION WITH THESE GO OUT. IN A COMBINED GRANT TYPE. EFFORT AS OPPOSED TO LOAN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL SUPPORT HER WHICH ARE OUR TECHNICAL ISSUES AND JESSICA CAN SPEAK TO THAT THAT WE DO WANT TO RESOLVE BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGE THERE. AND I JUST WONDER IF I COULD CLARIFY -- ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT THE USE OF THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND AS PART OF THE FUNDING SOURCE HERE ARE YOU WORK ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT. THE INTENT FOR HOW THE FUNDING -- WOULD GO OUT -- TO TO INDIVIDUAL GRANTEES YEAH WHAT WHAT WHAT BOTH UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS THAT IT WOULD GO OUT UNDER THE PRIOR RULES THE REVOLVING. LOAN FUND WHICH HAS HAD LIMITED SUCCESS RIGHT. THANK YOU SO -- NO THIS IS NOT INTENDED THAT THE ONE TIME -- FACILITIES INVESTMENTS IS NOT INTENDED TO MERE -- THE EXISTING CHILD CARE REVOLVING LOAN FUND -- IN ADDITION -- WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE -- THE AT THE THOUGHT BY THE ASSEMBLY -- TO ELIMINATE THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND AND MOVE THOSE FUNDS INTO THIS PROGRAM I'M CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONSTRAINT UNDER THE EXISTING PROGRAM I THINK THE ONLY CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT -- THAT MOVING SHIFTING THAT FUNDING FROM THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND INTO THIS POT OF MONEY -- IS THAT. THE THE FEASIBILITY OF IT IS A LITTLE BIT QUESTIONABLE JUST BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE LOAN REPAYMENTS BEING MADE INTO THAT PROGRAM -- AND IN ADDITION -- THAT PROGRAM ALSO HAS A COMPONENT THAT PROVIDES NO INTEREST LOANS. FOR THINGS LIKE HEALTH AND SAFETY -- RENOVATIONS AND SO WANTED TO KIND OF SPEAK WITH STAFF UNDERSTAND SORT OF THE INTENT BEHIND -- THAT THAT MOVE AT THIS TIME OKAY. YEAH AND I GUESS THERE'S SOME LOGISTICS ISSUES TO THAT OF THIRD SAID AT NON GOVERNMENT IT WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY IF IT SHUTS DOWN WHO'S THE LONG TERM. OWNER OF THAT I THINK WE WANT TO PROTECT THAT. TAXPAYERS INTEREST THERE BUT CREE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT IT'S ABLE TO BE UTILIZED EFFICIENTLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE. FOR MOVING ON TO ISSUE FIVE CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION ONE TIME WORKFORCE INVESTMENT. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AND THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED -- APPROVED IS BUDGETED WITH AMENDED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- THE THE SENATE SPECIFIES THAT TH ALLOWABLE USES INCLUDE TRAINING ON SERVING CHILDREN WHO ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS AND TRAINING FOR A CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ON HOW TO OPERATE SMALL BUSINESSES THE ASSEMBLY SPECIFIES THAT STIPENDS I'M SHALL BE ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S QUALITY RATING SYSTEM. AND THE SUPERINTENDENT SHALL DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR LOCAL PLANNING COUNCILS TO ADMINISTER-THE GRANTS ON THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER -- THESE FUNDS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE SPEED OF THE STATE SPENDING ON OTHER WORK FIRST TRAINING ACTIVITIES A STATE CURRENTLY SPENDS ABOUT FIFTY MILLION ANNUALLY ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING FOR PRESCHOOL -- CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS. ONE QUESTION I HAD A THE ADMINISTRATION -- IT IT APPEARS TO US THAT THE LANGUAGE -- WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE PLAYED LEGISLATURE HAS AN OVERSIGHT ROLE WITH REGARD TO HOW THE FUNDS ARE SPENT -- AND AND REALLY LIMITS OUR ENGAGEMENT. A IS THERE A CONCERN WITH THE APPROACH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE HAVE TAKEN WITH REGARD TO OUR ENGAGEMENT. SAID THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IT IS SUPPOSED TO THAT LANGUAGE -- MAINLY BECAUSE THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE WE REALLY WANT THAT TO BE A KEY VEHICLES TO INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE LONG RANGE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE LACK OF FLEXIBILITY THAT WE WOULD HAVE IF THAT LANGUAGE IS ADOPTED. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I SHOULD POINT OUT ALSO ON A SEPARATE ISSUE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES SUPPORT THE SENATE CLARIFICATION TO SUPPORT A BROADER RANGE OF PROVIDERS AND LEARNING NEEDS -- INCLUDING IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS SO ON THAT SPECIFIC ITEM THE ADMINISTRATION DOES SUPPORT THAT THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION. WHAT'S YOUR TIME FRAME -- AROUND THIS YET ONE MORE ENGAGEMENT AND STUDY ABOUT THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM I THINK I'VE LIVED THROUGH ADULT I'VE LOST COUNT -- AND IT'S WHAT YOUR TIME FRAME IN TERMS TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN DEAL. HAVE A CLEAR DIRECTION AND A ROADMAP YES SO -- WE KNOW THAT THERE IS -- A PROPOSAL FOR MONEY IN THE BUDGET -- FOR TO FUND THIS MASTER PLAN AND SO ASSUMING THAT THAT GOES FORWARD -- RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS AIMING FOR NEXT YEAR FALL -- TO REALLY DO A ROBUST EFFORT AND LOOK AT ALL OF THIS AND THE REPORT READY BY NEXT FALL AND I SHOULD. EMPHASIZE THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PRIORITIES AND IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT EVERY ISSUE BEING A PRIORITY BUT FOR THE GOVERNOR AND FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND LERI THIS IS REALLY HER LIFE'S WORK AND SO THIS WILL BE A PRIORITY OF THE MINISTRY. AND I WOULD JUST PASS OF THE TWO OF THEM THAT THAT WE NOT START FROM GROUND. ZERO THAT THERE HAS BEEN YEARS OF WORK IN TERMS OF SIMILAR EFFORTS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SO THAT WE NOT START AS IF WE HAVE A CLEAN SLATE BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T. AND SO I HOPE THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION FROM THE ASSEMBLY FROM JUST LAST YEAR AND AND OTHER SIMILAR EFFORTS WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT YES I DON'T EXPECT TO POINTS ON THAT NUMBER -- ONE IN SPECIFICALLY THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PREVIOUS EFFORTS OF CALM AND FOLKS ARE READING THEM AND LOOKING INTO THEM AND SO THAT WILL PROVIDE A BIG BASS FOR WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. DIES -- AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS I KNOW A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND HERE WHETHER IT WAS FOR THESE AFTER SCHOOL SLOTS WHETHER WAS RELEASED PRESCHOOL SLOTS. IS AROUND FUNDING AND WE KNOW IT'S ALWAYS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION TO HAVE IN TERMS OF WHERE NEW REVENUE MAY COME FROM BUT THAT IS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE PROPOSED MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO PUT TOGETHER. EXCELLENT WE APPRECIATE THE PRIORITIZATION THE FOCUS ATTENTION MOVIE NOT DOCTOR WEBER. NEXT YEAR -- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I I SEE HERE -- THAT THAT'S MENTIONED IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE THEY FOCUS ON ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AS AS A AS A AB. ONE OF THE SERVER POPULATIONS WHERE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AND YET WE KNOW. THAT THAT ITSELF IS SOMEWHAT NERO BECAUSE ENGLISH PROFICIENCY IS A MUCH BROADER CHALLENGE OF FOR THESE COMMUNITIES AND ALL AND OFTENTIMES THOSE ARE THOSE CHILDREN END UP ENTERING. OF SCHOOL WITH A LOW ENGLISH PROFICIENCY -- WHO ARE ENGLISH WHO SPEAK ENGLISH LANGUAGE TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE ENGLISH IN TERMS OF VOCABULARY -- BUT CHALLENGE SO THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT LATER ON I'M LOOKING AT TESTING AND REFINING THAT. KIDS IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AS OUR SCHOOLING SO LOW IN ENGLISH -- AND LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT'S MAINLY BE ENGLISH PROFICIENCY MUCH MORE THAN ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AND SO I I THINK WE HAVE TO BROADEN OUR PERSPECTIVE OR AT LEAST ENHANCE OUR PERSPECTIVE WITH REGARDS TO WHAT WE'RE DOING IN PRESCHOOL. AND CHILDCARE BECAUSE MANY FOLKS WHO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH PROFICIENCY -- SO THAT THOSE CHILDREN WHO ARE WHOSE PARENTS MAY SPEAK ENGLISH BUT DON'T SPEAK IT IN A MANNER THAT ALLOWS THE STUDENTS TO BE PROFICIENT IN IT. ARE OFTEN IGNORED IN TERMS OF THEIR LIVES THE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR THEIR ENGLISH LANGUAGE -- AND AS A RESULT THE END UP WITH LOWER VOCABULARY DOING VERY POORLY AT THE BEGINNING AND SEEM TO NEVER CATCH UP AS WE'RE FINDING WITH OUR LCF DATA SO. WE CAN ACTUALLY BE PUSHING THIS ENGLISH PROFICIENCY IN YET EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND LENDS IT COMES IN SECOND LANGUAGE SECOND LANGUAGE READ ENGLISH PROFICIENCY WHICH COVERS MORE THAN JUST SECOND LANGUAGE. AND INCLUDING COMPASSES EIGHT A HUGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN PARTICULAR POOR CHILDREN. A MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN WERE IN GREAT NEED OF ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. EARLY ON SO THAT THEY THEY DEVELOP EIGHT EIGHT AM. EIGHT EIGHT A USE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAT THE END IS THE USE OF KNOWLEDGE REALLY THE LANGUAGE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO THEN DO EXTREMELY WELL SO I WOULD URGE EVERYONE TO LOOK AT THE SECOND LANGUAGE. CONCEPT AND BASICALLY MOVE OURSELVES TO ENGLISH PROFICIENCY WHICH IS A MUCH BETTER CONCEPT STUDY AT UCLA. THAT SHOW THAT LA VETTING SUFFICIENCY IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND THIS IS A PLACE WHERE YOU STARTED BECAUSE THEN. YOU COULD MOVE ON TO ADD THAT WHEN THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN AND THEY'RE MUCH BETTER OFF IN A MUCH FURTHER HIT. AND SEVEN MINISTRATION DEFINITELY WANTS TO WORK WITH A NOTE THE SENATE LANGUAGE AND WORK WITH ALL THE ON THAT AND ONE POINT. I SHOULD MAKE ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE THIS IS FOR TRAINING SPECIFICALLY SO DIFFERENT FROM SOME THE FORMULAS WE SEE FOR THE HOUSE YET THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU COULD FOR TRAINING ACCOMPLISH BOTH OF THOSE PURPOSES RIGHT AND AND AND AND AND AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE. BU AND BUT IT HAS TO BE IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE HERE. IN ORDER FOR IT TO EVER GET TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER FOR BRINGING UP THAT POINT. PROFICIENCY. FOR DECADES WE HAVE DIMINISHED PROFICIENCY. IT IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. I APPRECIATE -- ALL THE MORE BRINGING IT UP BUT PLEASE TAKE THIS DID MANAGEMENT SRIOUSLY. THAT WE HAVE GOT TO BE FOCUSING ON PROFICIENCY. IT IS OUR GREATER DEFICIENCY I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW. TO A BROADER POPULATION. SENATOR MORE LOT. I'M TRYING TO CATCH THE VISION MADAM CHAIR AND SO I MAYBE FORGET FINISH THE SENTENCE WITH I WORK IN A SPEND A QARTER BILLION DOLLARS. IN ONE YEAR [inaudible] THE TRAIN [inaudible] CHILD CARE. EMPLOYEES AND I'M. ARE WE DOING A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM ARE WE DOING THIS MULTI YEAR RIGHT -- WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE VISION HERE I YEAH THAT'S AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IT'S ACTUALLY ONE TIME OVER FIVE YEARS SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE PIECE OF IT -- I THINK THE OTHER PIECES THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT I THINK HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR MORE YEARS THAN I'VE BEEN ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. ABOUT HOW WE IMPROVE OVERALL QUALITY -- AND PROFESSIONAL EYES ARE CHILD CARE WORK FORCE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION -- AT POINTED OUT IN ITS IN ITS -- REPORT AS WELL AS A SENATOR MITCHELL POINTED OUT THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER REPORTS INCLUDING OUR STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS -- HAS REPORTS ON THIS ON THEIR MANY NONPROFIT SAID REPORTS ON THIS -- THAT OUR OUR CHILD CARE IT NEEDS TO ALSO BE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE -- AND LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD WE INCREASE OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR FOLKS TO DO PROVIDE THIS CARE. AND I THINK THAT WE SEE THIS AS PART OF A LARGER CONVERSATION AROUND THE ENTIRE CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THAT YOU ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE RATES OF REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND HOW YOU ARE -- PROVIDING AT A SALARY FOR THE FOLKS WHO HAVE THIS HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL -- AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO THE SCHOOL READING THIS CONVERSATION AND HOW YOU INCREASE ACCESS TO THE TARGETED WAY THAT REALLY PROVIDES THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT FOR STUDENTS. SO THE VISION IS THAT THIS IS A PIECE OF A MUCH LARGER -- CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS I THINK IS WHY IT'S SO MPORTANT FOR US TO AS ADMINISTRATION TO ENGAGE IN THAT -- IMPORTANT MASTER PLAN PLANNING PROCESS BECAUSE WE TALK ALL THE TIME AND AND THE CHILD CARE WORLD ABOUT THE THREE LIKE IT'S STILL CHILD CARE YOU KNOW SLOTS. ARE ACCESS RATES IN QUALITY. AND I THINK THAT -- IN OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE WE KIND OF HAD SOME VERY YEARS WITHOUT AND SO WE WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL AND STRATEGIC ABOUT HOW WE MAKE. INVESTMENTS MOVING INTO THE FUTURE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE BRINGING UP ALL OF THOSE ALL THOSE BUCKETS ARE RISING IN A WAY THAT IS ALSO A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MANAGER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE. FIVE SEE NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION. THIS IS THE BUCKET OF ALL THE INVESTMENTS. I'M ISSUE SIX DISPLAYS ASSEMBLY PRIORITIES -- THIS ASSEMBLY PROVIDES SIXTEEN MILLION FOR DATA COLLECTION TEN MILLION FOR LOCAL PLANNING COUNCILS AND FOUR MILLION FOR CD TO COLLECT PROVIDER INFORMATION AND TWO POINT TWO FIVE MILLION FOR ON GOING FOR A NEW COUNCIL. ON THE ASSEMBLY ALSO PROPOSES TO AN ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION FOR STATE OPERATIONS FOR CD EASE EARLY LEARNING CARE DIVISION THIS IS IN ADDITION TO TWO MILLION THAT ALL PLANS PROVIDE -- AND WE WERE -- WE SO WE RECOMMEND THE SENATE HERE -- BECAUSE THE TWO MILLION PROVIDED BY ALL PLANS REFLECT AN 11% INCREASE IN CD EASE EARLY EDUCATION STOP CITY IS LIKELY TO A IS LIKELY TO FIND INCREASING THE STAFF EVEN TO THE US -- SENATE LEVEL CHALLENGING WITHIN A SINGLE YEAR. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION CARE TO COMMENT ON THE PROPOSAL YES OF FINANCE ALSO GENERALLY SUPPORT SAID THE SENATE -- ON THESE PROPOSAL ON THESE PROPOSALS WHEN IT COMES TO THE DATA SYSTEM -- WERE NEUTRAL ON THE SPECIFIC ITEM REGARDING WORKFORCE DATA COLLECTION -- BUT MORE GENERALLY -- THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING -- AS ALL OF YOU KNOW ON A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM PROPOSAL THAT CAN INCORPORATE ALL THESE ELEMENTS SO WE BELIEVE THAT THESE OTHER EFFORTS -- ARE DUPLICATIVE OR MAYBE TO FORGET ABOUT THAT HALF. FOR WHEN IT COMES TO THE COUNCIL THAT IS PROPOSED THAT WE BELIEVE ALSO THAT THERE IS A STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL RIGHT NOW ON EARLY LEARNING AND CARE. AND THAT CN ACCOMPLISH THE WORK OF THE PROPOSED COUNSEL FROM THE COMMISSION -- AND THEN FINALLY -- SIMILAR TO WHAT LA A MENTION WHEN IT COMES TO THE CD -- WE SUPPORT THE SENATE PROPOSAL. AB OUT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE THANK YOU TO MOVE ON TO FIFTY SEVEN CAL WORKS STAGE ONE CHILD CARE INVESTMENTS. ALL PLANS HERE PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR CAL WORK STAGE ONE CHILD CARE AND MAKE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM SO CURRENTLY A FAMILY PARTICIPATES IN STAGE ONE CHILD CARE UNTIL COUNTY DEEMS THE FAMILY STABLE. AT THAT POINT THE FAMILY TRANSITIONS FROM STAGE ONE TO STAGE TO CHILD CARE EACH COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHES ITS OWN DEFINITION OF STABLE SO HOW LONG THE FAMILY RECEIVES STAGE ONE CARE VARIES AMONG THE COUNTY'S. ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE A STAGE ONE FAMILY VERIFIES ELIGIBILITY MULTIPLE TIMES PER YEAR AND THEN THE HOURS OF CAREPROVIDED ARE DETERMINED BY REQUIRED ACTIVITIES. THE GOVERNOR IN THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN REQUIRE THAT ALL FAMILIES REMAIN IN STAGE ONE CHILD CARE FOR A MINIMUM OF TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE THE COUNTY MAY TRANSFER TO STAGE TO CHILD CARE. UNDER THE SENATE PLAN ALL FAMILIES I'M IN STAGE ONE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FULL TIME CARE BUT THE LENGTH OF THE TIME ON STAGE ONE WOULD STILL BUT BE DETERMINED BY THE COUNTY. THE SENATE PLAN ALSO FUNDS A DATA SHARING SYSTEM BETWEEN COUNTIES AND CONTRACTORS TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERRING FAMILIES FROM STAGE ONE TO STAGE. TWO UNDER ALL PLANS ONCE A TERM IN ELIGIBLE A FAMILY REMAINS ELIGIBLE FOR CHILD CARE FOR ONE YEAR OR UNTIL THE FAMILY TRANSFERS TO STAGE TO WHICHEVER COMES FIRST. THE BOTH HOUSES CHANGE POLICIES SUCH THAT STAGE ONE FAMILIES REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR CARE FOR TWELVE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS WITHOUTHAVING TO RE VERIFY ELIGIBILITY. THE STATE ADOPTED THIS POLICY IN STAGE TO WIN THREE A FEW YEARS AGO AND COST ENDED UP BEING SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN INITIALLY BUDGETED. DEPENDING ON HOW FAMILIES RESPOND COST COULD ALSO BE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AND CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE OUT YEARS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU MOVING ON TO ISSUE EIGHT OTHER CHILD CARE INVESTMENT. FOR NINE ISSUE EIGHT ARE ALSO ASSEMBLY PRIORITIES ON THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES THAT FORTY SEVEN MILLION ONGOING FOR THE EMERGENCY CHILDCARE BRIDGE PROGRAM FOR FOSTER CHILDREN. ON THE ALSO INCLUDE TWO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGES -- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CHANGES RELATED TO VOUCHER PROGRAMS ONE RELATED TO A PAYMENT BASED ON THE AUTHORIZED HOURS OF CARE AND ONE RELATED TO A P. AGENCY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THE FOSTER BRIDGE PROGRAM IT WAS CREATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO ALLOW FOSTER FAMILIES. TO ACCESS IMMEDIATE CHILDCARE SLOTS UP TO ONE YEAR -- UNTIL ONGOING SLOTS BECOME AVAILABLE ORANGE ONGOING TALKS BECOME AVAILABLE ON A REGULAR SUBSIDIZE -- CHILD CARE SYSTEM -- WITH REGARD TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR OUR PAYMENTS BASED ON THE HOURS AUTHORIZATION OF CARE -- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE'S A COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL [inaudible] THANK YOU. IN THIS. BECAUSE I SO. THREE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OOPS WE FUNDED. THE BRIDGE PROGRAM. BUT NOT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OR WAS THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FINDING OUT OF COURT FOR CONTINUE TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHTEEN WAS WHEN IT STARTED BUT IT DIDN'T CONTINUE IT'S A IT'S AN ONGOING PROGRAM. OKAY SO THAT WAS THE TH SO IF WE WERE. TO NOT. ADOPT THE ASSEMBLY. VERSION WITH THAT STOP. THIS IS JUST AN INCREASE OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM OKAY SO THE FUNDING THAT WAS ADOPTED IS ON GOING SINCE THIS WOULD BE AN INCREASE. OKAY AND IS THERE -- I KNOW THAT THE PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BEEN VERY% ESSENTIAL TO ASSISTING ON THE WE HAVE MANY MORE FOR CHILDREN. IN NEED OF FOSTER CARE FAMILIES THAN FAMILIES THAT HAVE COME FORWARD YET TO TAKE SUCH CHILDREN. SO ANYTHING LIKE THIS IS VERY VERY BENEFICIAL TO GETTING OUR CHILDREN PLACED IN GOOD STABLE HOMES -- IS THERE. DOES LA -- HAVE ANY DATA ON WHAT THE NEED GAP IS FROM THE FUNDING WE'VE PROVIDED SO FAR. AND OUT. IN WHAT THE ASSEMBLIES -- RECOMMENDATION MIGHT YOU KNOW IS IT GOING -- TO MEETING NEED GAP. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA ON HAND THIS THIS THAT THEY DID NEED IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE HERE BECAUSE THIS IS INTENDED TO BE A BRIDGE PROGRAM SO THERE ARE FOSTER FAMILIES THAT ARE ON SOME OF THE OTHER CHILD CARE PROGRAMS NOT JUST ON THE EMERGENCY BRIDGE. PROGRAM -- SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA TO EVALUATE THAT THE WHAT IS JUST THE NEED AND WHAT DOES THE CURRENT FUNDING MEET THE LEAK NEED OR WHAT IS AN ACCESS TO THE NEED FOR THIS PROPOSAL. CAN I CAN SAVE COMPETE PURELY ANECDOTALLY THAT WHEN I WAS RUNNING AT A P. -- ON OUR AGENCY THAT THIS WAS THE PRIMARY CALL WE WOULD GET FROM FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE A FAMILY MEMBER OF ON THE ON THE EMERGENCY CALL BUT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T. AT YOU KNOW ALREADY LICENSE FOSTER PARENTS. MANY YOU DON'T WORK FULL TIME AS TO THE FIRST QUESTION ALWAYS WAS CAN I GET SOME HELP WITH CHILDCARE SINCE I'M. HAVING THIS UNEXPECTED -- OPPORTUNITY -- AND SO IT WAS. WE GET LOTS OF CALLS EVERYDAY IN MANY THE AP AGENCIES I WORKED WITH THE AND EXPERIENCE IT TOO LIKE I SAID PURELY ANECDOTAL BUT IT IT'S A GAP KIND OF IN -- ARE -- AND COMPREHENSIVE KIND OF FOSTER CARE SERVICES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. I'LL JUST BRIEFLY SAY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WE SUPPORT THAT MERITS OF THIS PROGRAM BUT SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT WE WANT MORE OUT CALM AND OTHER DATA BEFORE AUGMENTING IT AT THIS TIME. FAIR ENOUGH. THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO SENATOR MITCHELL BBS HEALTHCARE ACTUALLY HAVE N ANSWER TO MISTER MCCARTY'S QUESTION GREATLY OR SO EXCELLENT -- THE EXCELLENT STAFF AT THE EARLY LEARNING CARE DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF ED -- HURT YOUR QUESTION AND SENT ME THIS INFORMATION -- SO THE PERCENTAGE OF SIX YEAR OLDS AND ABOVE -- IN STAGE THREE AT CAL WORKS CHILD CARE IS 60% -- IN A P. PROGRAM IS 45% STAGE TWO IS 39% -- I DON'T HAVE THE STAGE ONE NUMBERS BUT THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY SIMILAR TO STAGE -- TWO BUT I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE FIVE YEAR OLDS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE IN KINDERGARTEN. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. TRANSITIONING IF YOU WILL FROM EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION TO KINDERGARTEN AND PRESCHOOL FACILITIES MOVING ON TO ISSUE. NINE WE WENT AWAY -- EMILY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AN ISSUE NINE THE GOVERNOR SENATE AND ASSEMBLY EACH PROVIDE FACILITY FUNDING TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN OR PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT IN YOUR BINDERS IT SHOWS THE KEY DIFFERENCES AMONG THE THREE PLANS. WHEREAS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED SIX HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND THE SENATE APPROVED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND ASSEMBLY APPROVED TWO HUNDRED MILLION. TURNING TO PAGE TWO HERE WE HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY DIFFERENCES IN SOME ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. FIRST THE TWO HOUSES TARGET THE GRANTS RATHER DIFFERENTLY. THE SENATE TARGETS THE GRANT SPECIFICALLY TO LOW INCOME DISTRICTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVERTING PART DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS TO FULL DAY PROGRAMS. IN CONTRAST THE ASSEMBLY BROADENS THE GRANT PROGRAMS INCLUDE ALL DISTRICTS CONVERTING PART DAY KINDERGARTEN OR PER DAY PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS TO FULL DAY PROGRAMS. THE ASSEMBLY ALSO MAKES COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ELIGIBLE FOR THIS GRANT FUNDING. SECONDLY THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND ELIGIBILITY RULES IN THE SENATE PLAN MOST CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTEREST IN THESE FACILITY GRANTS WHICH WAS BASED ON A RECENT SURVEY THAT WE SENT TO LOW INCOME DISTRICTS CURRENTLY RUNNING PARDEE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. THIRD THE SENATE PURPLES PROPOSAL IS COORDINATED WITH THE STATE'S MAIN SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM. UNDER THE SENATE PLAN AT NEW CLASSROOMS BUILT UNDER THESE THREE THESE GRANTS WOULD FACTOR INTO DISTRICTS ELIGIBILITY -- FOR OTHERS STATE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES IN CONTRAST THE ASSEMBLY PLAN WOULD NOT FACTOR IN ANY OF THESE NEW CLASSROOMS INTO DISTRICTS ELIGIBILITY. LASTLY WE KNOW THAT THIS FAMILY ADOPTS A BROADER ELIGIBILITY RULES BY ALL ONLY PROVIDES FIFTY MILLION MORE THAN THE SENATE WE BELIEVE THIS MAY RESULT IN THE ASSEMBLY PLAN BEING OVER SUSPECTS SUBSCRIBED. AND IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE ASSEMBLY IS APPROACH WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER HOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING MIKE'S POTENTIAL APPLICANTS. THANK YOU. THREE MORE LOT. MADAM CHAIR I'M WONDERING IF I COULD ASK SENATOR REID QUESTION. OF COURSE YOU MAY THIRD A RAW FOOD ARE YOU OPEN TO RECEIVING A QUESTION. CERTAINLY OPEN TO THE LOWER PART OF THE ANSWER. YOU'RE THE CHAIR OF SUB ONE AND SO. THE GOVERNOR WANTS SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND YOU'RE SAYING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. HOW THAT DISCUSSION WENT TEN WHY YOU'RE WILLING TO DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR? A LOADED QUESTION. A LOADED QUESTION. I THINK I CAN WIN AND THAT IF YOU DON'T NO NO NO NO I ONE MORE EXPERIENCE CALLING FROM THE ASSEMBLY MY LA ON AND GO OVER TO THE SURE IF I MAY UM OUR ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SIX HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. WE SURVEYED -- DISTRICTS ARE LOW INCOME AND PROVIDING PARTY KINDERGARTEN TO SEE IF THERE WAS INTEREST IN THESE GRANTS AND OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE WAS NOT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF INTEREST AND SO. THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY BOTH DECREASE THE AMOUNT PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE THINK THAT MOVES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. DOES THAT. IN AMERICA THAT'S GREAT SO MR Và SPOTIFY UNDEAD. DO YOU WANT TO REBUT. YES SIR THE THE FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS AND IT IS TRUE FOR ALL OF US BUT FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN IS A REAL PRIORITY FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION AND I KNOW WITH SO MUCH DO FOR PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE BUT IF MOVING UP THE WAGE LADDER -- FOLKS WHO REALLY DO WANT TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN DO NOT HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY WE THINK THAT'S A REAL ISSUE SO THAT'S WHY WE PUT IN. SIX HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISION -- WHEN IT SPECIFICALLY COMES TO DEMAND THE TRUTH IS YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL FOR CASTING WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MANDATE WILL BELIKE? BUT IF MORE THAN HALF FOR EXAMPLE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT CURRENTLY HAS PARTAKEN REGARDING DO APPLY FOR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT BY ITSELF WILL EXCEED THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WE'VE MADE AVAILABLE AND IF IT TURNS OUT THE DEMAND IS LOWER THAN WE FORECASTED OBVIOUSLY THAT MONEY DOES NOT GO AWAY IT GETS SWEPT BACK RIGHT INTO THE BUDGET CAN BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES WHETHER FOR EARLY MORNING. OR OTHERS AND I'LL MAKE ONE POINT ALSO ON WHEN IT COMES TO LOW INCOME. SCHOOLS VERSUS OTHER SCHOOLS SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY AND IT IS A PRIORITY IN OUR PROPOSAL AT THE SAME TIME -- OR FOCUS REALLY IS ON CONVERTING PART DAY TO FULL DAY US BUSINESS ESPECIALLY FOR THE FIRST YEAR THE PROGRAM ACROSS ALL SCHOOL SO WHAT WE WANT TO PRIORITIZE LOW INCOME SCHOOLS WE THINK THAT OTHER SCHOOLS THAT MAY NOT FIT SPECIFICALLY WITH THAT WITHIN THAT INCOME BRACKETS. BUT WE'RE QUE -- PARENTS ALSO DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM SHOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR STATE FUNDING AS WELL. SO. A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M FINDING IT'S DIFFERENT. THIS YEAR FROM PRIOR YEARS IS THAT. GOVERNOR BROWN WOULD ISSUE A BUDGET AND YOU KNOW IT IS. DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PUSH HIM A LITTLE FURTHER OUT SAY WANT TO SPEND MORE. AND YOUR BOSS IS SORT OF GONE WAY OUT AND I'M KIND OF THINKING WHO PUSHES. BACK. IN SO I SEE THIS IS MAYBE ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES OF SAYING WE'RE GOING TO PUSH IT BACK A LITTLE BIT. AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN IT OCCURS AND WE'LL FIND OUT AS WE GO THROUGH. THIS PROCESS BUT I FIND IT ENCOURAGING THAT IS THE THE I MEAN THE VIRUS SENATOR ROBB I JUST THOUGHT. I WOULD GIVE THEM AN ATTA BOY. PERCENT OKAY THIS IS GREAT WE'VE GOT SOME HONEST DEBATE AND IT ISN'T JUST GOING TO BE. THE MAX AMOUNT SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU MADAM. CHAIR MISTER MCCARTY DID YOU WANNA ADD TO CENTS SURE WELL TO BE HONEST IT'S NOT LIKE WE TOOK THE DIFFERENCE AND PUT IT IN THE RESERVE WHICH YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE LIKELY RE PRIORITIZE IT. FOR OTHER EARLY LEARNING PRIORITIES BUT I THINK MISTER TEEING MENTIONED THIS A LITTLE WHILE AGO. THERE'S BEEN TWO REPORTS NOW. THAT TALKED ABOUT WHILE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN IS IS A GREAT QUESTION WE SHOULD BE DOING IT. WE STARTED LAST YEAR AND JUST pTHAT AND THE DEMAND WASN'T THERE WITH THE WITH THE AMOUNTS THAT WAS APPROPRIATE LAST YEAR NOR THIS YAR'S SO. THAT WE THINK IT WAS JUST AN APPROPRIATE LOWERING THE AMOUNT TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE REAL NEEDS ARE -- THE ASSEMBLY ONCE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE FOCUS NOT JUST ON KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES BUT PRE K. FACILITIES AS WELL WE WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE OTHER -- ISSUE WE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID THESE PROGRAMS ARE THREE LEGGED STOOL THERE'S THERE'S LOTS AND RATES AND QUALITY. AND THE THAT THE FACILITIES ON THE RATES PEAS ARE GO HAND IN HAND SO IF YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE FACILITIES YOU SOMETIMES HAVE TO TURN BACK MONEY AND SO. MAKING SOME OF THESE -- SCHOOL SITES AND DID NOT JUST FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BUT FULL DAY PRESCHOOL -- PROGRAMS WOULD ALSO BE A GOOD USE OF THAT ONE TIME MONEY. PAYMENT YOU'RE JUST TO TRY TO FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION -- YOU KNOW BUDGETING IS A BALANCING A PRIORITIES IN THE ONE THING THAT YOU'RE. ANALYSIS ON PAGE TWELVE WILL NOTE. IS THE ONE OF THE PRIORITIES WE BALANCED WAS THIS PRIORITY VERSUS. THE CRITICAL NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. ACROSS THE BOARD K. THROUGH. TWELVE AND INTO OUR HIGHER END OPERATIONS AND SO. THE MONEY THAT WE DID REMOVE FROM THIS PARTICULAR LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET. YOU WILL NOTE. AT ISSUE FORTY ONE ON PAGE FORTY FOUR OF YOUR ANALYSIS. WAS MOVED INTO THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL -- FOR A MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES PROGRAM -- WITH VARIOUS PARTNERSHIPS -- WITH COUNTY. MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THE QUESTIONS ON ISSUE. NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEING NONE MOVING INTO THE BIG KAHUNA. PROP NINETY EIGHT ISSUE TEN PEOPLE. THANK YOU LA -- FOR OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT PRIMER WHICH I HAVE TO RE READ EVERY YEAR. SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE THANK YOU. I THINK YOU KIND OF COUPON WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT'S IN YOUR BINDERS OVERVIEW OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT K. TWELVE ISSUES. STARTING WITH PAGE ONE OF THAT HANDLE BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED SMALLEY REVENUE PACKAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR. OF THOSE REVENUES LOWER REVENUES TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING YOUR WITH THE STATE IS REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO MEET THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE -- BUT RATHER THAN REDUCE FUNDING TO THAT MINIMUM LEVEL BOTH HOUSES UP TO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF FUNDING AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISION. UNDER ALL THREE PLANS TOTAL GENERAL FUND AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE FOR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY IS EIGHTY ONE POINT ONE BILLION AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT NINE BILLION OVER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVEL. BY TURNING TO PAGE TWO ALTHOUGH THE PLANS ALL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING THEY DIFFER IN A COUPLE KEY WAY IS. A FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN INCLUDES -- DEPOSIT INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SCHOOL RESERVE OF THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION THAT'S THE LARGEST OF THE THREE PLANS -- THE SENATE DEPOSITS NINETY MILLION AND THE ASSEMBLY HAS NO DEPOSIT. OUT THE LOWER DEPOSITS UNDER THE TWO HOUSES PLAN I PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE HOUSES HAVE THOSE SMALLER REVENUE PACKAGES. THE PLANS ALSO MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES ABOUT THE MIX OF ONE TIME AND I'M GOING SPENDING. THE SENATE PLAN SPENDS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION LESS ON ON GOING PROGRAMS THAT HAS AVAILABLE AND I'M GOING RESOURCES. SO THAT GIVES THE PLAN A SMALL OPERATING SURPLUS MOVING FORWARD. THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE SENATE AS FAR AS THAT MIX. BY THE ASSEMBLY PLANTS SPENDS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION MORE AN ON GOING PROGRAMS THAN IT HAS AVAILABLE IN ONGOING RESOURCES AND SO THAT CREATES A SMALL DEFICIT MOVING INTO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET CYCLE. UNDER ANY OF THE THREE PLANS. BOB RATHER SMALL BUDGET CUSHION A MUCH SMALLER THAN YOU HAD IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THAT SMALLER CHRISTIAN ONGOING PROGRAMS AND MORE VULNERABLE TO REDUCTIONS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN. DURING THE NEXT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER BUILDING A LARGER BUDGET QUESTION I YOU COULD DO THAT BY MAKING ELECTED DEPOSIT INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SCHOOL RESERVE. OR ALLOCATING MORE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. FINALLY THE ASSEMBLY -- BUT NOT THE GOVERNOR THE SENATE UP TO EIGHTEEN SOMETHING KNOWN AS THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TRIP ACCOUNT. THIS IS A MECHANISM THE STATE CREATED LAST YEAR TO ADJUST SCHOOL FUNDING AND RESPONSES IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEED THAT HAPPENED ONCE THE YEAR IS OVER. WE RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY SECTION BECAUSE WE THINK THE TRIP ACCOUNT WITH SOME STEPS WITHOUT FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS OVER TIME. I TURNING TO PAGE THREE ON SOME OF THE SPECIFIC K. TWELVE PROPOSALS THE LARGEST AUGMENTATION UNDER ALL THREE PLANS FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. GOVERNOR IN THE SENATE EACH PROVIDE TWO BILLION TO FUND THE STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION ON TOP OF THAT AMOUNT WE THINK THE EMPHASIS ON ON L. CFF UNDER ALL THREE PLANS MAKE SENSE. THAT'S GOING TO GIVE SCHOOLS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABILITY TO PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND FLEXIBLE IN STRATEGIC WAYS. THE NEXT LARGEST ITEM A SPECIAL EDUCATION. BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE A NEW SIX HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM. INSTEAD THE HOUSES UP TO EQUALIZE EXISTING SPECIAL SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES AND TO PROVIDE NEW ONGOING FUNDING. FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WHO HAVE DISABILITIES. WE THINK THE HOUSES TAKE A MUCH MORE PROMISING APPROACH FROM THE GOVERNOR AND WE RECOMMEND YOU MAINTAIN -- HOUSES APPROACH IN YOUR FINAL BUDGET PACKAGE. THERE ARE TWO OTHER NOTABLE DIFFERENCES THE SENATE HAS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION ONE TIME TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE. INTENDED TO INCREASE COLLEGE PREPARATION AND COLLEGE ATTENDANCE RATES AMONG LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOSTER YOUTH. I THE ASSEMBLY HAS AN ACTION TO SHIFT SOME FUNDING FOR CREEK TECHNICAL EDUCATION FROM A PROGRAM THAT IS ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO A DIFFERENT PROGRAM THAT'S ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WE THINK THAT SHIFT CREATES MORE COHERENT APPROACH TO CREATE TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND WOULD RECOMMEND YOU ADOPTED. THE NEXT TWO PAGES IN YOUR HAND OUT A SHORT OF KEY FUNDING DIFFERENCES THAT ARE IN CONFERENCE SO PAGE FOR A SHOWING YOU THE DIFFERENCES AN ONGOING SPENDING. PAGE FIVE THE SHOWING YOU THE DIFFERENCES IN ONE TIME SPENDING WILL COVER ALL OF THESE ITEMS AND LATER AGENDA ITEMS. BY TURNING TO PAGE SIX AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS TO THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED LAST% YEAR. EACH HOUSE THEN WENT ON TO ADOPT SOME OF ITS OWN MODIFICATIONS TO THE FORMULA. I BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES WE THINK THE SENATE PLAN WOULD REDUCE SOME OF THE VOLATILITY IN THE FORMULA WILL STILL PROVIDING STRONG INCENTIVES -- FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT OUTCOMES. BOTH HOUSES ALSO PROVIDE MORE ON GOING FUNDING FOR FACULTY -- BUT THEY HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT APPROVED. AND FINALLY THE HOUSES TAKE DIFFERENT ACTIONS FOR SOME ST'S SUPPORT SERVICE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER IS ANSWERED HOUSING PROGRAMS. PAGE SEVEN SHOWS YOU THE KEY DIFFERENCE IS AN ONGOING SPENDING FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PAGE IT SHOWS YOU THE DIFFERENCES AND ONE TIME SPENDING. WITH THAT OF CLOTHES AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF COURSE. SURE -- ON PAGE TWO THE SIZE OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE DEPOSIT. ARE YOU USED TERM CUSHION BUT BUT HOUSE THE RAINY DAY FUND HOUSE AT CALCULATED. SO THE SIZE OF THE DEPOSIT INTO THE RAINY DAY FUND IS DRIVEN BY -- SOME FORMALISM THE CONSTITUTION. THAT WERE PART OF PROPOSITION TWO THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN I AT A HIGH LEVEL ARE THOSE FROM LESS REQUIRED DEPOSITS WHEN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. IS GOING FASTER THERE IS SWEETLY ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR FUNDING LEVEL ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE AN INFLATION FACTOR. SO THE MORE REVENUE THAT YOU HAVE GENERALLY THE LIGHT TO DEPOSIT THAT'S REQUIRED THE LOWER DEPOSITS UNDER THE HOUSES PLANNER BECAUSE ARE MAINLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOWER REVENUE ESTIMATES. AND WHO WAS THE GOVERNOR'S. RECOMMENDATION CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE FORMULA. YES SO THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED MAKING THE DEPOSIT THAT WAS REQUIRED UNDER THEIR REVENUE PACKAGE. WE DO NOTE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION OF MAKING A LARGE DEPOSIT THEN THAT AND THEN WHAT IS REQUIRED. BEGIN OPTIONAL DEPOSIT -- BUT THE ADMINISTRATION A PROPOSED MAKING THE CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED DEPOSIT UNDER THEIR REVENUE ANOTHER ASSUMPTIONS WHAT'S THE CURRENT BALANCE IN THE RAINY DAY FUND -- CURRENTLY IT HAS A ZERO BALANCE THE STATE HAS YET TO MAKE A DEPOSIT INTO THE REST ARE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE. SO WE HAVE. ZERO WITH GET THE GOVERNOR RECOMMENDING. THE CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED AMOUNT BUT WE HAVE BOTH HOUSES. BUT LOWER MATH. OKAY. NEXT QUESTION IS ON PAGE -- THREE ON THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING THAT WAS. WHY ONE OF THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS AT THE MAY REVISED? WAS FOR THE GOVERNOR TO PUT MORE FUNDING IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION -- AND NOW THERE'S PUSH BACK IN YOU AGREE WITH THE PUSH BACK SO I'M JUST WONDERING WAS HIS ANNOUNCEMENT. WAS IT NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT OF PREMATURELY WITH. I TINK WE HAD SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS THAT WE HAD IN JANUARY -- THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF CHANGE TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM IN MAY IT WAS BUT A MUCH LIGHTER DOLLAR AMOUNT -- SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCENTIVES THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD CREATE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD. PENALIZE DISTRICTS THAT WERE% MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES -- WE ALSO THOUGHT THERE WERE BETTER WAYS TO DISTRIBUTE THAT FUNDING -- FOCUSING ON SOMETHING LIKE EQUALIZATION COULD DISTRIBUTE THAT FUNDING A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ATTRACTED FUNDING PRETTY NEARLY TO A SUBSET OF DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. OKAY -- WHICH HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BAKER CRIES HAVING SERVED ON SUB ONE THAT TO GET MORE MONEY FOR A FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S DURING THAT TIME. ABOUT TRYING TO ADJUST THAT LAST QUESTION ON PAGE FOR THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN TRYING. TO ENCOURAGE -- MORE FUNDING FOR CAREER TRAINING EDUCATION AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHY IT'S IT'S ZERO ACROSS THE BOARD. SURE SO FOR THAT THAT -- ONE IT'S REALLY THE PROPOSAL IS REALLY A SHIFT OF FUNDING SO IT'S MORE ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT TO FIND AT THE KICKOFF STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM WHICH IS RUN OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OR YOU WANT TO FIND THE CITY AND SOME OF GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS MORE OF A A COMPETITIVE GRANT BASED PROGRAM THAT'S FROM OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE THAT'S IN CONFERENCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND AT ALL. I'LL MAKE A COUPLE VERY BRIEF COMMENTS -- FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT ON THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT LEVEL -- THE ADMINISTRATION OF COURSE SUPPORTS OUR MAY REVISION REVENUES COMPLETE WITH THAT TAX CONFORMITY PACKAGE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AND ALSO PROVIDES MORE REVENUE. ACOSTA BUDGET BUT I DO WANT TO ALSO POINT OUT FOR THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- ONE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF WE IF THAT COMMITTEE ADOPTS A LOWER REVENUE TARGET BUT OVER PROPERTY TO GUARANTEE AT THE LEVEL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED. REVISION AND THEN -- BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS BASED ON ACTUAL REVENUES NOT ESTIMATED REVENUES SO REVENUES DO CON AND ABOVE -- WHAT THE LEGISLATOR IS PROJECTION -- OVER THE UPCOMING YEAR -- ACCORDING TO THE WAY WE'RE SEEING THE PROPOSITION NINETY GUARANTEE RIGHT NOW THAT ADDITIONAL MONEY -- WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE DEPOSITED IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE RATHER THAN BEING GOING DIRECTLY TO SCHOOLS AT ALL AS THE LEGISLATURE IS PROJECTING. SAID THAT COULD CREATE A WHOLE OF POSSIBLY SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET PACKAGE IF THE LEGISLATURE MOVES FORWARD THAT WITH THAT APPROACH. I'M I'M HERE TO APPLY THE GOVERNOR I'M I I WANT TO VOTE FOR A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR COUNTRYSIDE BOTH FOR TRIPLE THAT. LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH WITH WITH THE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR DISTRICTS IN AND LOOKING AT THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT ISSUES AND AND AND IT'S EMBARRASSING THAT THE BALANCE CURRENTLY IS. ZERO TOLD. THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP TO IT I APPRECIATE. SO I WILL SAY IT WHILE WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THANKS -- IT'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT IS REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION [inaudible] RIGHT. BUT YOU GET TO PROPOSALS THAT ARE LOWER. THE BY A TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THREE OPTIONS I AM TELLING YOU PUBLICLY I SUPPORT YOURS THANK YOU [inaudible] THIRTY ALSO. IT'S NOTED HERE ON PAGE. THREE THE K. TWELVE PRIORITIES AND THE ASSEMBLY ACTION WAS TO SHIP THE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FROM THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. A TO THE CAREER TECH ADD INCENTIVE GRANTS -- THEN IT WAS ASSEMBLY REMEMBER WHAT THE LOGIC WOULD THAT BE SHOWN PARTY. SURE THAT SYMPATHY WITH IT BUT I YEAH THE NOTION WAS WE ARE WE ALL LIVE CD WE TRIED TO TO HAVE A THAT. AS A AS A CATEGORICAL FOR YEARS AGO. AS AS OPPOSED JUST A ONE TIME. AS THE PRIOR GOVERNOR. HAD IT AND SO WE WE SAT ON THE AMOUNT OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION BUT LAST YEAR WE HAD TO PROGRAMS ONE AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM KIND OF RUNNING A K. TWELVE EFFORT. AND THIS QUE TWELFTH AND SO I THINK THAT THE THE THE THE LARGER ADVOCATES FOR C. T. AND THE ASSEMBLY FELT IT WAS BETTER TO KEEP IT IN OR THE EXISTING. K. TWELVE CT PROGRAM AND THAT THEY HAVE THE THE CENTER GRANVILLE'S GO. YEAH IS THE THE K. TWELVE INCENTIVE GRANT EFFORT WHICH HE BEEN USING WITHOUT WAS BUT SUPPORT WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL SO WAS JUST A GOOD SOLID IN UNDER. ONE WELL AS AS A DADDY THE SENATE GRANT PROGRAM YEARS AGO I COMMEND YOU FOR THIS YOU KNOW BUT BUT THREE YEARS AGO. MAYBE FOR NOW THE WHOLE INCENTIVE GRANT WAS WIPED OUT. REX. AND THEN IT CAME SAILING BACK AND WAS EXPANDED FROM JUST GREW TECH B<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AG ADD TO ALL CAREER&lt;/c&gt;</u> TECH. AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS IT'S SOME DISCRETIONARY FUNDING. TO THESE CAREER TECH PROGRAMS THAT REALLY ARE SUCCESSFUL AND THIS DISCRETIONARY. REVENUE HAS GIVEN THEM A HUGE BOOKS SO I'M VERY MUCH IN SYMPATHY WITH THIS ASSEMBLY ACTION [inaudible] MR BROUGHT. I THANK YOU SO. I JUST HAVE TO EXPRESS ALL OF FRUSTRATION HERE. JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT. VIEW HERE SO WERE. THE MINISTRATIONS OF FUNDING JUST THE BARE PROP NINETY GUARANTEE AND AND THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY HAVE DONE. SUBS A LITTLE BIT MORE I MEAN ALIKE ON THE ORDER OF A COUPLE PERCENTAGE POINTS. AND IF WE PASS. THIS WAY WE WILL BE ABOUT DIGITAL AMOUNT TO A MODEST PER CAPITA STUDENT SPENDING INCREASE WILL TAKE US JUST TO ABOVE GINGER JUST OVER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. IN K. TWELVE EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. THAT PUTS US FORTY FIRST IN THE COUNTRY [inaudible] AND A THE GIVEN THE COST IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO BE IN THE TOP TEN NOT IN THE BOTTOM. TEN SO I'M JUST WONDERING MATHIS. I KNOW I'M I'M PREACHING THE CHOIR AND WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO FIND CALTRAIN TWELVE EDUCATION AT A HIGHER LEVEL MR MCCARTY AND I HAVE A BILL ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO CHEAT IT EXPRESSES THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO GET. TO THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE AMONG STATES. THAT WERE SENT OVER TO THE SENATE BUT NOT NOT THAT'S JUST INTENT LANGUAGE THAT THE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THAT HAPPENED HERE. EVERY YEAR AND I'VE BEEN ON CONFERENCE DOWN THREE YEARS AND EVERY YEAR WE TALK ABOUT WANTING TO FUND K. TWELVE EDUCATION AT A HIGHER LEVEL I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN K. TWELVE IN CALIFORNIA A LOT OF THEM. STEM DIRECTLY FROM THE FACT THAT. WE DON'T FUNDED AN PPROPRIATE LEVEL SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN IS ON THIS. AND THE REASON WHY I'M FRUSTRATED I MEAN I KNOW WE CAN POUND THE TABLE SO WE WANT MORE MONEY AND THERE IS MORE MONEY BUT EERY TIME WE MAKE A DECISION TO FIND. ANOTHER PROGRAM AND I THERE'S LOTS OF NEEDS OUT THERE AND IT TUGS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS EVERY TIME WE WE TALK ABOUT -- EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION OR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN OR AFTER SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE ALL CERTAINLY GOOD. PROGRAMS BUT EVERY TIME WE SPEND A DOLLAR IN ONE OF THOSE IT'S A DOLLAR THAT WE COULD HAVE SPENT ON K. TWELVE AND I JUST KIND OF FEEL LIKE. WE NEED. TO MEET OUR COMMITMENT. TWO EXCELLENTK. TWELVE EDUCATION BEFORE WE DIVERSIFY SO. TO PUT IT BACK ON THE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES THEIR PLAN HERE YOU KNOW YOUR EVERYYEAR TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WERE. NOT IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE PER CAPITA STUDENT FUNDING AND FOR K. TWELVE AMONG STATES. SO WE CERTAINLY SHARE THAT GOAL OF WANTING TO INVEST MORE IN OUR SCHOOLS THAT IS A PRIORITY OF THE GOVERNOR AND SO THE FIRST POINT AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS BUT THIS HAPPENS YEAR BY YEAR AND SO WE ARE NOW TO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT LEVEL. LESS THAN A DECADE AGO WAS FORTY SEVEN BILLION NOW WE'RE PROPOSING ABOUT EIGHTY BILLION SO THAT'S OVER ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WOULD YOU THINK THAT IS WE ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- AND THEN THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT THERE IS A CONVERSATION TO BE HAD ABOUT HOW WE CAN INVEST EVEN MORE IN THE YEARS TO COME CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PRESSURES ON THE GENERAL FUND. BUT I WILL POINT OUT IN THIS BUDGET ALTHOUGH PROP PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS THE PRIMARY VEHICLE FOR SENDING MONEY TO SCHOOLS THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING THAT REALLY DO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT CAL STARS BEFORE. THAT BY ITSELF THE ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S GOING TO CAL STARS -- ON BEHALF OF SCHOOLS WE ALSO HAVE YOU MEASURES IN OUR BUDGET FOR TEACHER TRAINING WERE ACTUALLY RE BENCHING THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEEING PULLING OUT SOME NON ELLIE A PRE CASE LOTS WE'RE ADDING NEW PRE K. SLOT SO I THINK WHEN YOU ADD UPALL THESE MEASURES TOGETHER. IT IS A PRETTYSIGNIFICANT PACKAGE RESPECTING THE FACT AS YOU STARTED THAT WE DO HAVE MORE TO GO FROM HERE OKAY WELL. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND I I THINK THAT. A LOT OF THE STATISTICS THAT I QUOTED DON'T INCLUDE EFFORTS INCLUDING THE ONES THAT YOU MENTION IN OUR FACILITIES FUNDING -- AND OUR BOND FUND AND THEN ANOTHER. THAT WERE TAKING BUT I JUST THINK WE ALL NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT PROP. NINETY EIGHT IT IS COMPLETELY IN A SEPARATE. CONSIDERATION THEY ON THE LEVEL AT WHICH WE SHOULD BE FUNDING EDUCATION AND I THINK WE GET CAUGHT UP. IN THIS IDEA THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT HE SHOULD BE THE LEVEL THAT WE FIND. K. TWELVE EDUCATION AT YOU KNOW AND THEN WE MOVE ON TO OTHER THINGS AND IT'S KIND OF THIS ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A HOLISTIC LOOK AT WHAT OUR MISSION IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN FUNDING K. TWELVE FIGURE OUT WHAT APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVEL FOR THAT. IS AND THEN JUST MAKE SURE THAT'S ABOVE WHAT PROP NINETY EIGHT OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT PUTS ON WHICH WILL BE. SO SO IN OTHER WORDS I MEAN I THINK THE PERSON WE'RE LOOKING AT PROP NINETY EIGHT IS KIND OF THE CEILING AND IT SHOULD BE THE FLOOR. AND I REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU IN FUTURE YEARS TO YOU KNOW TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT BECAUSE I WANT TO BE SITTING HERE ANOTHER THREE YEARS FROM NOW HAVING THIS THE SAME DISCUSSION ABOUT IT THE GARAGE. THANK YOU MISTER FISHER -- I JUST WANTED. COME BACK TO THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM AND CREW TECH EDUCATION CENTER BRIDGES FOR A MOMENT JUST. TO INDICATE THAT I I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS I UNDERSTAND THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. IT IS DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH REGIONAL WORK FORCE NEEDS. PUTTING TRAINING FOLKS BOTH YOUNG AND SOME NOT SO YOUNG. FOR THE JOBS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST IN A REGION. AND THAT THE CAREER TECH EDUCATE. EDUCATION SAID OF RIP PROGRAM IS MORE ALIGNED WITH GIVING. FOLKS SORT OF A A JOB EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S OUT THERE. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT SIDE PICTURE ON IT THAT'S WHY I HOPE WE GET TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ON IT BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE. THEN FOR AREAS SUCH AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN FOR IN ONE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. FRANKLY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO FUND PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY IDENTIFY. WHAT THE SKILLS ARE IN THE JOBS ARE IN THE REGION? AND GIVE FOLKS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN UP FOR THOSE JOBS SO THEY ACTUALLY CAN SECURE. A GOOD SOLID. WELL PAYING A POSITION AT THE END OF THE OF THE PIPELINE AND SO I DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THAT IN MAY AND I DON'T FRANKLY CARE WHO RUNS IT COMMUNITY COLLEGE K. THROUGH TWELVE THAT'S I'M AGNOSTIC ON THAT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. ABOUT THAT -- BEFORE WE ELIMINATE ONE PROGRAM -- IN FAVOR OF ANOTHER ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ONE WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO THIS GOING TO BE THE SURVIVOR. IS GOING TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH. THAT VERY VERY IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU OF STRUCTURE WILL SAY -- FROM FINANCE AND A BRIEF WE TURN INTO MY COLLEAGUE BUT THAT IS A PERSPECTIVE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SHARES I THINK THE GOAL OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO CREATE TECHNOLOGIC ASIAN SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US CARE ABOUT BUT THAT SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON REGIONAL COORDINATION REGIONAL ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS. AND REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS ACOSTA INSTITUTIONS IN A SPECIFIC AREA IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE ADMINISTRATION MADE THE PROPOSAL THAT IT'D. BUT MAY JUST FOLLOW UP I I DON'T KNOW I ASSUME THERE'S SOME. STUDY YOUR REVIEW THAT AT SOME POINT WILL GO ON TO WHICH YOU HAVE TO PROGRAMS IT ESSENTIALLY DO THE SAME. THAT SOMEWHAT DO THE SAME THING THAT WE CAN DETERMINE WHICH ONE IS MORE. EFFECTIVE IN ACCOMPLISHING THE OBJECTIVE MAYBE THEY BOTH ARE AND IF THEY BOTH ARE MAYBE THEY MERGE AND IF THEY'RE NOT MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST. ELIMINATE ONE OR THE OTHER WHETHER IT'S STRONG WORKFORCE WHETHER ITS CREW TECH -- IN SAID EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT I DON'T KNOW. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SENATOR ROTH YOU'VE YOU'VE HAD ON THAT ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE K. TWELVE COMPONENT OF THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM IN THE C. T. E. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM. AND REALLY THE JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY BOTH PROGRAMS EXIST AND WERE ENACTED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET. ON THE CAGE WALL FROM WORK FIRST PROGRAM REALLY IS ALIGNED WITH REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS -- THE EIGHT REGIONS THAT ADMINISTER THE PROGRAMS DEVELOPED LOCAL PLANS AND THAT IDENTIFIES THE KEY PRIORITY INDUSTRY AREAS IN THEIR IN THEIR REGIONS. AND THEN THE CITY PROGRAMS THAT ARE AWARDED FUNDING UNDER THE GRANT PROGRAM HAVE TO ALIGN WITH THOSE IDENTIFIED REGION IDENTIFIED INDUSTRY PRIORITIES THAT HAVE BEEN -- LOCALLY DETERMINED. WE WILL THERE BE SOME ULTIMATE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE. WHETHER ONE OR THE OTHER IT BETTER ACCOMPLISHES THE GOALS OF WHETHER BOTH ACCOMPLISH VERY VERY IMPORTANT GOALS COMING TO THE SAME. POINT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. AND AND THATIS -- A DISCUSSION THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING SINCE LAST YEAR I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS HAS REALLY THEIR OBJECTIVE THE CAREFUL STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IS IS MORE WORK FOR STRIPPING. ON THE C. T. E. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM IS AS YOU MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW TO INCENTIVIZE CITY PROGRAMS LOCALLY BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ALIGNED TO WORK FORCE NEEDS IN THE REGIONS -- SO THE CONVERSATION HAPPENED HAPPENING BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON HOW THE TWO PROGRAMS CAN COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER. AND HOW -- ELEAZAR APPLYING FOR BOTH PROGRAMS CAN LEVERAGE THAT FUNDING TO REALLY PROMOTE CTP -- YOU KNOW TO TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FINE I DIDN'T MEAN TO BELABOR THIS I JUST WANTED. TO INDICATE THAT I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE ELIMINATE ONE PROGRAM OVER ANOTHER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS ISSUED IN. GOTICKETS WE GOT BACK TO THE BLUE PAGES ALL RIGHT. A PROP NINETY EIGHT ISSUE. TEN THANK YOU SO I THINK THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS IF I MAY TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR ISSUE ELEVEN PERFECT. ANY QUESTIONS. I THOUGHT WE'D GONE BACK COME TO DO EVERYBODY'S COOL THAT'LL BE PASSED ISSUE. TEN WONDERFUL ISSUE ELEVEN THANK YOU. BRIAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ISSUE OF IN HIS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION -- THERE ARE A COUPLE SMALLER ITEMS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SITE HERE THE SENATE PROVIDED ONE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. TO A SCENE OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR CONSTRUCTION TRADES PROGRAM. AND THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED ONE MILLION EACH TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN SIX DIFFERENT COUNTIES -- THE LARGEST ISSUE AS WE JUST DISCUSSED IN THE LAST -- ISSUE. IS THE ASSEMBLY SECTION TO CONSOLIDATE K.. TWELVE TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS UNDER THE EXISTING CITY INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE ASSEMBLY IS ACTION ON THIS. THING. WE ALL OF ALREADY HAD A PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS I WON'T BELABOR THESE POINTS. HELLO JUST NOTE THAT -- WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE FIELD IS THAT THERE IS SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT WAS THE STATE'S INTENSE AND SETTING UP THESE TWO PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH THERE IS -- THIS DIFFERENCE IN SCOPE THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ABOUT THE ALIGNMENT WITH REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS [inaudible] THAT'S NOT -- TAKING CONTRADICTORY OF WITH THE GOALS OF THE SEATING INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM MOM MANY PROGRAMS ARE. LOOKING AT BOTH OF THESE AS POTENTIAL SOURCES OF OF FUNDING AND SO THERE'S UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION OF EFFORT IN TERMS OF APPLICATIONS. AND MAKING THESE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE FUNDS FOR US WE WE THINK. THESE ISSUES COULD BE RESOLVED BY CONSOLIDATING UNDER SINGLE AGENCY CD DOES. TO OUR MIND APPEAR TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE AGENCY GIVEN THEIR HISTORY WORKING WITH K. TWELVE CT PROGRAMS. AND WE THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE DISCUSSION IF YOU'D LIKE TO REVISIT THE SCOPE OF THE C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT IN MAKING THIS DECISION TO CONSOLIDATE UNDER THAT AGENCY [inaudible] THIRTY SKINNER. I'M JUST CURIOUS. LA -- IN IN. MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION ASSESSED. THE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE THAT -- GENERAL ROTH POINTED OUT OF THE AT LEAST FROM WHAT THE MATERIALS I'VE READ ABOUT THE CITY. PROGRAM WHICH I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY FOCUSED ON THE JOB SKILL DEVELOPMENT UNIQUE TO A PARTICULAR REGION -- SO IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT. YEAH AS WAS DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS IT WOULD BE THE FOCUS THAT THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM HAS. ON REGIONAL JOB SKILLS AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS A REASONABLE INTEREST IN ST -- THAT THAT POLICY OBJECTIVE IS INCLUDED AND THEIR K. TWELVE CT PROGRAMS. WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- RATHER THAN CONTINUING THESE TWO PROGRAMS THAT ARE LARGELY DUPLICATIVE WITH THIS -- THE SLIGHTLY NUANCED DIFFERENCE IN SCOPE. AB TO REVISIT THE SCOPE OF THE C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT IT INCLUDES THAT CONCERN IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO BE A PRIORITY [inaudible] SENATE ROTH. WELL I'M DO I'M JUST CURIOUS AND I I NEED. TO FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR MORLOCKS QUESTION AND GO BACK TO THE BOOKS ON THIS ONE AS WELL BUT IN THE IN THE X. CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION CENTER GRANT PROGRAM IT'S ADMINISTERED BY CITY. THAT'S CORRECT THE SOLE OF MY UNDERSTANDING WITH RESPECT TO THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IT'S SORT OF A REGIONAL CLEVER TELL US I'M SORRY THAT SIXTEEN SENATE GRANT PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED BY CDC THIS STRONG WORK FORCES MINISTERED BY. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RIGHT MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM HOWEVER IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A REGIONAL CLEVERNESS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS. A COMMUNITY COLLEGES K. THROUGH TWELVE ELEAZAR K.. TO TWELVE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY JOB SKILLS AND THEN K. AS IN FOR IN TERMS OF SO THAT'S THE DEMAND SIDE WHICH FRANKLY I THINK WE NEED. TO IMPROVE BUT THAT'S THE DEMAND SIDE IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING SKILLS AND JOB NEEDS. AND THEN THE EDUCATIONAL A COLLABORATION DECIDES TO HOW TO DESIGN THE THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO MEET THOSE SKILLS IN THOSE JOB NEEDS WHETHER IT'S AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL OR AT THE CASE OF TWELVE I GOT THE RIGHT GENOCIDE PICTURE YOU DO. SO TODAY DOES THE CAREER TECH EDUCATION CENTER GRANT PROCESS. IN COMPASS THAT SAME TYPE OF OF COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. BUT NOT ON A REGIONAL BASIS NOW OKAY. THANK YOU MANAGER [inaudible] QUESTIONS. I JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT FROM PLEASE -- SO I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE STRONG WORK FORCE VERSUS C. T. -- SPECIFICALLY ON THE INVESTMENTS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- THE ADMINISTRATION -- SUPPORTS ITS OWN PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT SUPPORT THOSE AUGMENTATIONS -- NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORTHY PROGRAMS BUT BECAUSE THEY FALL WITHIN THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE SO WOULD BE. PREMISED ON REDUCTIONS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE EIGHTY ONE POINT ONE BILLION. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. WE WILL MOVE ON TWO WELL BUT FIRST WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THE LA JOH. ON CAVE TO FOURTEEN PENSION RATE RELIEF PROPOSALS. ALRIGHT SO FOR THIS ISSUE WE HAVE ANOTHER HANDOUT THAT TO SET THE STAGE BECAUSE YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT THIS AND THIS ITEM AND THEN SEVERAL SUBSEQUENT ITEMS THROUGHOUT YOUR CONFERENCE AGENDA. ALSO STARTING WITH PAGE ONE BOTH THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR IN BOTH HOUSES HAVE SEVERAL PROPOSALS RELATED TO THE PENSION COSTS FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND AS YOU KNOW -- THE STATUS TO PENSION SYSTEMS FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES CAL STAR IS ADMINISTERS PENSION BENEFITS FOR STATE POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES LIKE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS. AND CALPERS ADMINISTERS PENSION BENEFITS FOR ALL OTHER SCHOOL EMPLOYEES LIKE CAFETERIA WORKERS OR BUS DRIVERS. AT TO READ REITERATE SOMETHING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S SAID EARLIER -- THE PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU REALLY COME IN TWO FLAVORS SOME ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE SCHOOLS OF SHORT TERMBUDGET RELEASED OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. I THINK THE ANALOGY THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MCCARTY AND OBERNOLTE RAISED EARLIER ABOUT THAT BEING LIKE THE SOMEONE PAYING -- A MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ON YOUR BEHALF FOR TWO YEARS AS AN APT VERY APT ANALOGY. THE OTHER PROPOSALS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE LONG TERM RELEASED BY PAYING DOWN UNFUNDED LOT PENSION LIABILITIES. AND AGAIN THAT'S A BIT MORE LIKE PAYING DOWN THE PRINCIPAL OF OF THE MORTGAGE SOMETHING HAT REDUCES COSTS AND PAYMENTS OVER A PERIOD OF TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS. THAT SO STARTING IN WITH JUST THE SHORT TERM PROPOSALS I MAY HAVE A TABLE WITH THAT AND PAGE TWO OF OUR HAND OUT -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN SHORT TERM RATE RELEASE. THE SENATE PROVIDES ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION IN THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES ONE POINT TWO BILLION. APART FROM THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS THERE REALLY TWO MAJOR DIFFERENCES AMONG THE PLANS. FIRST THE GOVERNOR PROVIDES RELIEF SPECIFICALLY FOR TEACHERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES COVERED BY CAL STAR IS WHEREAS BOTH HOUSES PROVIDE RELIEF FOR EMPLOYEES COVERED -- FOR BY EITHER PENSION SYSTEM. THE GOVERNOR IN THE ASSEMBLY ALSO PROPOSED TO PAY FOR ALL OF THAT RELIEF NOW AS PART OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. WHERE IS THE SENATE DIFFERS SOME OF THOSE COSTS TO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET? TURNING TO THE LONG TERM PROPOSALS AT THE GOVERNOR AND BOTH HOUSES MAKE A PAYMENT OF TWO POINT THREE BILLION TO REDUCE. THE SCHOOL SHARE OF UNFUNDED LIABILITIES THAT CAL STAR IS. BY THE ASSEMBLY MAKES THAT PAYMENT BUT ALSO HAS ANOTHER PAYMENT OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION -- SPECIFICALLY FOR THE POOL OF FUNDS -- THAT'S USED TO ADMINISTER BENEFITS -- FOR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES WHAT PAYMENT TO CAL CALPERS -- TURNING TO PAGE. THREE WE RECOGNIZE THAT ALL PLANS HAVE A BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM RELATE RATE RELEASE ON THAT SIDE WAS A KEY PART OF ALL THREE PACKAGES. BUT ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES BEFORE YOU IS ON THE MARGIN HOW MUCH FUNDING YOU ONE ALLOCATE NOW TO SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM RELEASE. AND AND MAKING THAT DECISION WE WOULD URGE YOU TO PRIORITIZE THE LONG TERM RELIEF. ONE REASON IS THAT THAT GETS YOU AGREE TO RETURN. FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU PUT IN THE SHORT TERM RELEASED A SCHOOL SAVE A DOLLAR OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS --% BUT FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU PUT INTO LONG TERM RELIEF A SCHOOL SAVE TWO TO THREE DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES. ANOTHER REASON IS THAT THE LONG TERM RELIEF PROVIDES -- SORT OF BUDGET HELP FOR DISTRICTS ON MORE OF A SUSTAINED BASIS SO RATHER THAN JUST HELPING DISTRICTS BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS -- THAT COULD HELP SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMIC UPS AND DOWNS THAT LIE AHEAD. A HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YEAH. ONE TWO ISSUE TWELVE CHARACTERS AND CALPERS FOR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. I'M SORRY BELIEVE FOR AN ISSUE. THIRTEEN OF COURSE WE ARE -- CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THANK YOU. NO PROBLEM. SO -- THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IS THE STATE'S PRIMARY MECHANISM FOR FUNDING. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS THE GOVERNOR IN NINETEEN TWENTY TO REFLECT A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT A THREE POINT. GOING COSTS IN NINETEEN TWENTY OF SUPPORTING THE LCS PFAFF -- IS SPECIFICALLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT COST WITH SOME ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS. THE SENATE PROIDES THE SAME INCREASE AVAIL CFF IS THE GOVERNOR BUT ELIMINATES THE FUNDS SPONSORED DOES NOT USE ONE TIME FUNDS TO COVER ANY ONGOING I'LL SEE IF OF COSTS. IN THE ASSEMBLY -- PROVIDES A LARGER INCREASE OF ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR BILLION. REPRESENTING AN EFFECTIVE COLA RATE OF THREE POINT 88%. OF THE ASSEMBLY ALSO DEDICATES ONE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN MILLION AND ONE TIME FUNDS TO PAYING SOME ON GOING COSTS AND I'LL SEE IF OF CONSISTENT WITH OUR OFFICES --LONG STANDING RECOMMENDATION ON USING ON GOING FUNDING SOURCES TO COVER ON GOING COSTS WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE SENATE ACTION IN THAT REGARD. OF BUDGETING SUCH THE WITH THE IN YOUR ON GOING PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT THE PACKAGE YOU ARE ABLE TO COVER THE ENTIRE COST OF ELSE IF [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEE NINE AGAIN WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN PENDING. MISTER MCCARTY SORRY I THOUGHT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM FINANCE DO SO. SURE I'LL SAY VERY BRIEFLY THAT -- FINANCE GENERALLY SUPPORTS THE SENATE APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE. OKAY -- AND SO -- MY COMMENTS WILL BE. WHAT DAHLE CHANNEL WHAT MISTER OBERNOLTE HAD NOTED EARLIER? WHICH IS -- YEAH WE HAVE INCREASED SCHOOL FUNDING AS AS YOU KNOW TWO BY. 50% A ROUGHLY. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. OR STILL FORTY FIRST THE NATION AND ANY GETS ITS MIND -- BLOWING TOO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE'VE HAD THIS HUGE INCREASE AND WE HAVE MORE DISTRICTS ON THE BREAK THERE BEFORE. YOU KNOW RIGHT HERE. IN -- IN SACRAMENTO LA IN OAKLAND NOPE SENATOR ROTH. THIS AND THE SENATE HAD A LENGTHY HEARING WITH FAKE MATT. A FEW MONTHS AGO -- BUT I TUNED IN IT AND WATCHED YOUR HEARING I THOUGHT IT WAS IT WAS GREAT DISCUSSIONS FAR AS WHAT'S HAPPENING. WITH OUR WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SO -- YOU KNOW THIS CALL IS IS IS AN IMPORTANT CALL ABOUT IT IT'S JUST A BAND AID I THINK WE NEED A REALITY CHECK. THAT WE CAN PUT OURSELVES IN THE BACK AS FAR AS WE'RE WE'VE BEEN SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. BUT TODD TELL THAT TO SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW IT. SUPERINTENDENTS ARE TEACHERS IN THE WORKS AS FAR AS WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IN OUR CLASSROOMS ON I WANT TO BE THAT FUN PLACE HERE AND SAY THAT. NEGATIVE STOP I THINK IT'S JUST A REALITY CHECK FOR SEARS UNDERSTAND AND WE'VE BEEN AS YOU NOTED THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THERE IS HOW WE ALLOCATE FUNDING WITHIN THE GUARANTEE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE CALL AND SO WE BELIEVE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT. FOR NOW IS THREE POINT 26% AND WE ALSO KNOW THERE'S A DISCUSSION WHICH LA -- BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON AROUND CERTIFICATION AND HOW THAT CALL -- WHAT HAPPENS TO IT IN FUTURE YEARS I AM HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL A DAY AS YOU NOTED -- LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHERE EDUCATION FUNDING GOES FROM HERE AND SAID THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SUPPORT THE SPECIFIC. INTENT LANGUAGE THAT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSED -- BUT WE DO WANT TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHERE EDUCATION FUNDING GOES FROM HERE THIS WEBER. YES -- I I APPRECIATE THE THE THE CONVERSATION FROM MY COLLEAGUES AND ALL AND AS YOU KNOW I'VE I'M JULIE VERY SILENT WHEN IT COMES -- TO RAISING US UP FROM FORTY ONE TO WHEREVER WE WANT TO BE -- MAINLY BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THAT CONVERSATION FOR SEVEN YEARS AND I'VE SEEN NO PROGRESS AND IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT IT'S OUR FAULT -- AND I DON'T ENGAGE IN THE CONVERSATIONALIST PEOPLE SERIOUS ABOUT ACTUALLY DOING THAT AND IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN JUST. A SHUFFLING THE CHEERS ON THE TITANIC. THE REALITY IS IS THAT PROP THIRTEEN GUIDED US IN AND CHANGED US IMMENSELY AND WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT NOW SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY I THINK IT WAS A WHENEVER AND IT WOULD NOT CHANGE IT WILL NOT CHANGE UNTIL WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING AT REVENUE WHERE IT COMES FROM AND HOW WE FUND SCHOOLS. AND SO I YOU KNOW I AS A AS I DON'T SAY A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW I I I'M FRUSTRATED BY OTHER THINGS AND AND THOSE THINGS I CAN PROBABLY SOLVE. THIS ONE CAN BE SOLVED TO WITH THE COURAGE DOESN'T LIVE WITHIN BOTH HOUSES TO DO IT AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT -- REQUIRES DRAMATIC CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT BEING FORTY ONE OF FORTY EIGHT AND A HALF ALL FORTY EIGHT OF FORTY IF WE CAN TALK ABOUT OUR SCHOOLS SINKING AND THEY'RE DROWNING. AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ENVISION HOW WE WANT TO BE LIKE KENTUCKY IN NEW YORK MASS WHEREVER WE WANT TO GO. BUT IT'S NOT WOULD NOT GOING THERE WITH THE CONSTANT PROCESS THAT NGUYEN GAYS IN NOW. SO I AM LOOKING FOR A GROUP OF SIRIUS LEGISLATORS WHO REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. AND BE COURAGEOUS ABOUT GETTING THE INFORMATION TO CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S DECIDING THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE ARE NOT ONLY SINKING OUR K. TWELVE WAS THINKING OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS AND ALL OF THOSE BECAUSE OF HOW WE FUND EDUCATION. SO WE NEED TO STOP THINKING THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE WE CAN. MAYBE NOT GIVE ADDITIONAL SLOT IN PRESCHOOL THAT WE ALL OF A SUDDEN GOING TO RISE UP TO NUMBER TWENTY FIVE IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. AND AND I'M NOT THE GREAT. ECONOMIST AROUND HERE MOST OF YOU ARE BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN THIS CONVERSATION TOO LONG. SO I JUST WILL SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES AS WE COUNTY TALK ABOUT THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF WE WANT TO DO AND ALL OF A RESOLUTION SYSTEM. HE WAS MOTIVATION TO GET TO THE TOP. THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK WITHOUT SOME SERIOUS CHANGE THAT'S ALMOST [inaudible] WHO WE? PREFECT WEBER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER [inaudible] FOURTEEN ISSUE FOURTEEN A SPECIAL EDUCATION YES -- SNOW TO EARLIER THE GOVERNOR PROVIDED ARE PROPOSED PROVIDING SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX MILLION AN ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION RELATED SERVICES. TO A SERVING SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES OR WHO WERE LOW INCOME FOSTER YOUTH AND ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS. OF BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THAT PROPOSAL AND BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED A POLICY OF PROVIDING THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION AN ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. TO GLIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION PER PUPIL FUNDING RATES UP TO THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE. IN ADDITION BOTH HOUSES DEDICATED SOME FUNDING -- SPECIFICALLY FOR SUPPORTING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES TWO THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. HOWEVER THE THIS FUNDING AMOUNT AND THE APPROACH DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES. THE SENATE PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION -- FOR TWO PURPOSES FIRST TO MAKE MOST FOUR YEAR OLDS WITH DISABILITIES ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND THIS ALLOWED THEM TO GENERATE FUNDING UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND SECOND TO PROVIDE A FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR PER CHILD GRANT FOR EVERY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD WITH DSABILITIES SERVED IN ANY MAINSTREAM EDUCATIONAL. ENVIRONMENT. THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES TO INTRINSIC STEAM MILLION. TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE EXISTING K. TWELVE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING FORMULA CURRENTLY THIS FUNDING FORMULA RELIES PRIMARILY. AND K. THROUGH TWELVE ATTENDANCE OF COURSE THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WHO DON'T COUNT AS ATTENDANCE. AT THE ASSEMBLIES PROPOSAL WOULD DOUBLE COUNT KINDERGARTNERS ESSENTIALLY USING THAT SECOND COUNT OF KINDERGARTNERS AS A PROXY FOR FOUR YEAR OLD. NOW WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE ASSEMBLY CTION ON THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ALTHOUGH IT'S A LARGER DOLLAR AMOUNT WE THINK IT'S A MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING -- APPROACH TO FUNDING K. TWELVE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SPECIFICALLY INTENT OF NOT PROVIDING ANY INCENTIVE FOR INAPPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES OR SERVING THEM AND ONE ENVIRONMENT AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER. IT'S ALTERNATE OVER TO MICHAEL I JUST GOT TO SPEAK ON THE PERFECT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU -- SO A COUPLE THINGS AT THE FIRST IS TO PROVIDE SORT OF SOME CONTEXT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S AT THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL -- WHICH YES AS NOTED EARLIER -- HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE JANUARY -- WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE ISSUES RATHER SUCH OCCASION IN AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE THERE ARE -- LAYERS OF CHALLENGES SO OUR FOCUS IS ON AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE HIGH PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AS WELL AS HIGH PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME -- ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND USE IN FOSTER CARE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT WITH OUR PROPOSAL -- IS THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE KEEP BY THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THESE. CONCENTRATIONS OF POPULATIONS -- THAT ARE IN AND IN THE SCHOOLS -- AND I I I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT -- THERE IS SOME CONCERN AROUND -- THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS WHERE THE GREATEST NEED IS AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. TARGETING THE FUNDING -- IN REGARDS TO THE TWO PROPOSALS -- PROVIDED BY BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY I THINK OUR MAJOR CONCERNS ON THE EARLY EDUCATION PIECE -- ARE JUST THE AS THE NATURE OF HOW THE FUNDING IS PROVIDED ON AN EIGHTY A BASE MODEL. WHICH MAY GROW IN THE OUT YEARS AT A GREATER RATE THAN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE GROSSED WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACTS OF THAT. OF AN ADDITIONAL THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL AND THE PROVISION OF EARLY TRANSIT OR THE EXTENSION OF REALLY TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN TO INCLUDE -- CHILDREN WITH IT PEACEFUL WE WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE POLICY WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT. GIVEN THE NATURE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT IN THE ON GOING A PICTURE THAT -- HERE WE MAKE WE MAY FREE UP SOME FUNDS IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE FOR THAT BUT THAT THE GUARANTEE DOESN'T NECESSARILY GROW IN THE OUT YEARS. TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASED COST OF THAT [inaudible] MESSAGING. ARE DISCUSSED EARLIER COMMENT ON THE COMMISSION POLLS. HERE WE WE WE COMMENDED REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WE HAD SEVERAL MAJOR CONCERNS WITH IT. OUR OUR IRST MAJOR CONCERN WAS THAT A ADOPTED THE INAPPROPRIATE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD BE RECEIVING THE FUNDING -- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE ESTIMATE THAT. EACH ELIGIBLE CHILD WOULD GENERATE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ON GOING FUNDING. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WERE BENEFITING UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BY CONTRAST THE AVERAGE STUDENT WAS SPECIAL EDUCATED. RECEIVING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVES ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SERVICES FROM LOCAL FUNDING SOURCES. THIS INDICATES THAT THERE'S A VERY STRONG INCENTIVE NOT ONLY TO NOT REDUCE SPECIAL EDUCATION IDENTIFICATION RATES IN THOSE DISTRICTS PUT ACTUALLY TO INCREASE THEM IN ORDER TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IN ADDITION WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDING UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS HAS BEEN NOTED. OF RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE OF DISTRICTS WOULD QUALIFY FOR FUNDING ABOUT A QUARTER OF DISTRICTS WOULD RECEIVE ANY FUNDING. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND LOOKING AT THE COLLECTION OF DISTRICTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT WE WE DON'T SEE A PARTICULAR RHYME OR REASON. THERE'S NO STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN THE LIST OF BENEFICIARIES UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND LISTED -- AND SELF REPORTED SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES THERE ARE MANYDISTRICTS THAT HAVE VERY HIGH SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD RECEIVE NOTHING. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE -- BELOW AVERAGE SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD RECEIVE A QUITE A LOT OF FUNDING UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. JUST A FALL TWO MINISTRATION COULD YOU COMMENT AS TO WHY. ONLY TWENTY FIVE WHY WHY YOU CHOSE TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT ONLY. REALLY BENEFIT 25% OF THE DISTRICTS IN A TIME WHEN THE POPULATION ACROSS THE STATE'S GROWING. CERTAINLY SO I I WOULD REFER BACK TO MY COMMENTS FROM EARLIER ABOUT -- WANTING TO TARGET THESE FUNDS -- TO THE THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE -- THIS SORT OF A GREAT NUMBER GREATEST NUMBER OF BARRIERS ARE COMBINED -- WHERE YOU'RE DEALING WITH -- A POPULATION OF STUDENTS THAT MAY HAVE IN ADDITION TO NEEDING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES I'M ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS AROUND -- YOU KNOW NEEDING ADDITIONAL HELP IN IN ACQUIRING ENGLISH AND POTENTIALLY ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS TO SOCIAL SERVICES -- I THINK THAT AS YOU KNOW. WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE CONVERSATION AROUND SPECIAL EDUCATION THIS IS AN AREA. OF GREAT INTEREST FOR THIS GOVERNOR AND I THINK REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THIS CONVERSATION FOR THIS YEAR -- WE INTEND TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION IN FUTURE YEARS -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WORKING WITH YOU ALL -- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INEQUITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY INHERENT IN OUR EIGHTY SIX OH TWO FORMULA THANK YOU [inaudible] THIRTY ROCK [inaudible] SO. I HAVE SOME BASIC CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION GRANT ANYWAY. WHERE YOU HAVE TO SCHOOL DISTRICT LINED UP SIDE BY SIDE? SCHOOLS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LINE ONE DISTRICT OVER 55% FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FOSTER KIDS THE OTHER ONE WAS LESS THAN 55% -- BUT BOTH HAVE AS A DISTRICT BUT BOTH HAVE 70%. IN THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS. FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FUND FOR KIDS. ONE DISTRICT GETS A CONCENTRATION GRANT RIGHT. THE OTHER DISTRICT DOESN'T. BUT THE PERCENTAGES IN THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL SITES. ARE THE SAME. IT DOESN'T COST ANY LESS IN THE ONE DISTRICT TO EDUCATE THE KIDS. THEN IN THE OTHER THE MONEY GOES THROUGH THE DISTRICT NOT BE BASED ON THE SCHOOL SITE RIGHT. TO UNDERSTAND MY POINT YES I I THINK I'M I MAY BE MISUNDERSTANDING YOU SO -- ACCORDING TO OUR FORMULAS THE S. ANY SCHOOL THAT HAS -- AND DUPLICATED -- CFF PERCENTAGE ABOVE 55% SO I I BELIEVE IN BOTH QUé IN THIS CASE BOTH OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- COOL SITE IS SUPPOSED TO DISTRICT NO SCHOOL DISTRICT I'M TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL SITES. TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH THEN ALLOCATE FUNDS -- FOR AT ALL ALL STUDENTS TO THE SCHOOL SITE BASED ON THEIR LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. ONE DISTRICT GETS CONCENTRATION GRANT AND THE OTHER DOESN'T CORRECT -- I BELIEVE THAT BOTH OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S UNDER YOUR EXAMPLE WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING FOR CONCENTRATION IF THEY HAD A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS A DISABILITY RETIREMENT DISABILITIES NOW. ON TOP OF MY BASIC PROBLEM WITH CONCENTRATION GRANTS. SO THAT I'LL GET TO MY QUESTION WHAT'S THE NEXUS BETWEEN. FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER AND FOSTER CHILD. PERCENTAGES IN A DISTRICT AND EDUCATING SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS BECAUSE THE DISTRICT FORTY GETS CONCENTRATION GRANT MONEY. TO EDUCATE THE FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER KIDS. WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT SPECIAL NEEDS. YOUNG FOLKS AND THE EXTRA MONEY THAT IT TAKES TO EDUCATE THEM SO WHAT'S THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE CONCENTRATION GRANT PEAS. AND FUNDING SPECIAL EDUCATION AND THAT'S MY PROBLEM. AS I UNDERSTAND IT. SO YOU CAN CORRECT ME THAT'S MY PROBLEM IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION I THINK I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION NOW SO WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS WHO ARE -- AS I'D IDENTIFIES AND DUPLICATED FOR THE PURPOSES OF ELSE EFF. ON THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS -- WITH DISABILITIES WHO IDENTIFIED FOR LC FF -- WERE HIGHER THAN THE STUDENTS WITHOUT DISABILITIES WHO ALSO QUALIFIED AS AN DUPLICATED FOR THE PURPOSES OF L. CFF. AND THAT CONCENTRATION WAS SPECIFICALLY STRONGER AMONG FOSTER YOUTH AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS -- FOSTER USE HAD AS MANY MAGNITUDES OF INCREASE FOR LIKELIHOOD OF BE IDENTIFIED -- FOR HAVING IT AS A NEED FOR AN IEP -- SO THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN BEING A DUPLICATED STUDENT AND HAVING A DISABILITY. WELL YOU KNOW THE PRICE AS I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM AND THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR. AT THIS RODEO IN EDUCATION BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE COST OF EDUCATING SPECIAL NEEDS YOUNG FOLKS. IS SO GREAT -- WAS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ESSENTIALLY CREATES WINNERS AND LOSERS IN -- SPECIAL ED ARENA DOESN'T IT I MEAN SOME. DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO GET MORE MONEY BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE OF A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FOSTER KIDS AND AND FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH AND OTHER DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE LEFT WITH WHAT THEY GET UNDER THE NORMAL. SPECIAL NEEDS FUNDING ALLOCATION FORMULA WHICH IS CERTAINLY INSUFFICIENT EVEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. WHAT IS NET FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SOMETHING? SO -- I THINK THAT ONE THING I'D LIKE TO KIND OF GO BACK ON HIS EARLY COMMENT I MADE ABOUT YOU THIS WE SEE THIS IS SORT OF A FIRST STEP AND AGAIN THIS IS A TARGET APPROACH FOR THE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING -- ON A MULTI YEAR PROCESS IN WHICH WE LOOK AT THE ENTIRETY OF HOW WE FUND ON SPECIAL EDUCATION THE STATE. ANDSO SO WE SEE THIS AS SORT OF STEP ONE BUT RECOGNIZING THAT YES THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS ON THINGS LIKE EQUALIZATION OF BASE RATES -- EXTREMELY HIGH COST LOW INCIDENCE A STUDENTS IN THE COST OF CARE FOR THOSE STUDENTS WE RECOGNIZE THOSE THINGS AND WE AND WE DEFINITELY WANT TO HAVE. MORE LONG TERM DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES I'LL JUST MAKE ONE POINT ON THAT AS JESSICA MENTIONED. THE END GOAL IS REALLY TO GET MORE RESOURCES ACROSS AS WE WERE DISCUSSING FOR THIS SPECIFIC -- AND YOU POINTED OUT THE NEXUS THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THAT -- SCHOOLS WITH UNDER LOCATED PEOPLES. WHO ALSO HAVE KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS -- SOLVING BOTH OF THOSE TOGETHER CREATES ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES COMPARED TO SOLVING ONE OR THE OTHER AND THEIR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED SO FOR THIS AUGMENTATION WE WANT TO TARGET THAT NEXUS THAT YOU MENTION. OKAY THANK YOU. IF I MAY CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE OUR OFFICES DONE SOME WORK ON THE OVERLAP BETWEEN. THOSE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS INDIAN DUPLICATE ACCOUNT INSTANCE WITH DISABILITIES-- WE WOULD AGREE WITH FINANCE THE THERE IS -- OVERLAP AND IT DOES VERY BASED ON THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. IN PARTICULAR FOSTER YOUTH ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DISABILITIES AND FOR THAT SPECIFIC REASON -- THE STATE'S CURRENT K. TWELVE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING PROGRAM -- INCLUDES ME OUT OF HOME CARE -- FUNDING FORMULA WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE AREAS THAT SERVE MORE FOSTER CHILDREN MORE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING FOR THEM. THE ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE MORE COMPLICATED. BASED ON THE LITERATURE ITS SUCCESS THAT IS LARGELY. REFLECTIVE OF INAPPROPRIATE DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES THAT -- OR OR INEFFECTIVE TREATMENT PROCEDURES WHERE -- WHEN A CHILD HAS BOTH -- ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY DIFFICULTIES AND A DISABILITY IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY THAT DISABILITY DISENTANGLE IT AND PROVIDE THEM -- APPROPRIATE SUPPORTS AND RECENTLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THAT DIAGNOSIS OF A PROBLEM AND DEVELOPING A NEW MANUAL THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY ON THAT ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS THIS IS LARGELY WHAT IS DRIVING. THE STATE'S ARE AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SPECIAL EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANTS PROPOSAL IS THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND WE JUST DON'T FIND A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN THAT POPULATION INSTANCE WITH DISABILITIES. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LITERATURE THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THIS AND SOME STUDIES FIND A POSITIVE CORRELATION BUT MANY OF THEM DON'T. AND LARGELY THE ONES THAT DON'T FIND THAT CORRELATION USE AT FOUR PM AS THEIR MEASUREMENT. OF STUDENT POVERTY THAT JUST TENDS NOT TO SHOW A STRONG CORRELATION WITH STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND MY AND MY ONE OF MY PROBLEMS IS. A DISTRICT THAT HAS 51%. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH FOSTER KIDS UNDER THIS PROPOSAL [inaudible] GETS. AND NOW FUNDING NOTHING UNDER THIS NEW PROPOSAL OTHER THAN WHAT THE DISTRICT WOULD NORMALLY GET SOONER WILL SPECIAL EDUCATION FUND ON OCCASION RIGHT. CORRECT SO THE DIFFERENCE OF FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS MAKES A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GETTING EXTRA MONEY. AND NO MONEY. IN AN ARENA WHERE NOBODY GETS ENOUGH MONEY. TO COVER THE COST OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SORT THIS OT I APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TO TRY TO DO THIS AND I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR ANYMORE THANK YOU MCCARTY. YEAH I JUST WANT -- TO BRIEFLY OUT ON THAT I I CAN THAT. THIS -- THIS THIS PLAN. HAS. A COUPLE BIG WINNERS. LARGELY THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN LARGELY -- LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS A BIG DISTRICT AND NEEDS HELP HAS A BIG ISSUE WITH. WHAT SPECIAL AT POPULATION BUT THIS IS THE ISSUE AND ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS AND ACTUALLY THE PROPOSAL FOR LA THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED LA HELP HELP SACRAMENTO A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN EQUALIZATION BUT? IT JUST IT THAT WAS AN A FAIR. PLANNED FOR THE OTHER SIX DISTRICTS IN MY DISTRICT AND THE THOUSAND DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO. I THINK THE THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY -- GOT A RIGHT HERE RECOGNIZING THERE IS A NEED BUT THERE IS THERE IS A A FAIR WAY TO ALLOCATE. THE RESOURCES THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND MISS SKINNER THANK YOU [inaudible] SEVERAL. WORKED WHERE I'M. SORT OF HAVING TROUBLE AS WELL. IN GENERAL WE DO NOT FIND SPECIAL EDUCATION ADEQUATELY AND WELL ALL THREE PROPOSALS ARE A STEP. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH YOU KNOW VARIOUS PROS AND CONS. WOULD PROBABLY STILL DON'T GET IT AT GET USOUT WHAT WE NEED WHICH I THINK IT'S BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED -- BUT ON THE ALEJO'S POINT WELL THERE. WHILE THE RESEARCH MAY NOT SHOW A CORRELATION BETWEEN A HIGHER NUMBER OF SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS AND INCOME IN OTHER WORDS THAT. I WONDER IF WE HAVE ANY DATA ON THE THE HOW WELL. THE CHILDREN. IN OUR LOWER INCOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ARE IDENTIFIED. WITH A SPECIAL NEED OR NOT IN OTHER WORDS. IT. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT. OR I COULD IMAGINE THAT THERE'S FACTORS THAT. CONTRIBUTE TO A LITTLE LOWER DETECTION RATE. PARTLY THE SCHOOL ITSELF. GIVEN THAT WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY FIND -- SPECIAL NEEDS THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S INTERESTS AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT IN YOUR PURPOSE WE TRYING TO DO IT BUT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY IN THEIR INTERESTS TO IDENTIFY. WHAT'S OF KIDS WHO NEED ARE YOU PIECE -- SO THAT MAY BE A FACTOR ADDITIONALLY -- DEPENDING ON THE OTHER PRESSURES THE PARENT OR PARENTS OF THE LOWER INCOME CHILD MAY HAVE IS OR EVEN THEIR ACCESS TO OTHER -- HEALTH CARE THAT MIGHT. IDENTIFY THAT SPECIAL NEEDS THAT I WOULD GUESS THAT THERE WOULD BE DATA THAT INDICATES THAT ARE MIDDLE INCOME IN HIGHER INCOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROBABLY HAVE A HIGHER IDENTIFICATION. OF KIDS IF WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SO I GUESS WHAT. I WHAT I EAT. ON THE ONE HAND I SEE THE LOCAL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO GET AT IF THAT IF WHAT I'M DESCRIBING IS REAL. MORE FINDING TO THE LOWER INCOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TRY TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THE PROPER VALUATION AND IF THERE ARE KIDS WITH -- I EP NEEDS WE CAN GET THEM THE AP. ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT YOU'VE RAISED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A PERVERSE. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS. BUT HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE. A I MEAN WE WANT EVERY KID WHO IS ACTUALLY. IN NEED OF AN I. E. P. M. THEIR APPROPRIATE SPECIAL NEEDS -- FINDING TO GET THAT SO. WHAT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE I THINK THAT'S REALLY FOR ME THE CHALLENGE HOW DO WE ACCOMPLISH THAT? THINK IT SAID. VERY PERSONAL QUESTION -- IT'S A FIRST TO TALK ABOUT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS FOR THE CORRELATION BETWEEN INCOME AND DISABILITY WHICH I MENTIONED BRIEFLY EARLIER. THERE ARE GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT -- CAUSAL MECHANISMS FIRST THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT -- POOR MATERNAL HEALTH AND IN PARTICULAR PORT MATERNAL NUTRITION WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCOME. IS LINKED WITH LOWER BIRTH THROUGH WEIGHTS WHICH ARE LINKED WITH THE INCIDENCE OF SPECIFIC LEARNING DIABILITIES WHICH ARE BOTH THE MOST COMMON. SOURCE OF DISABILITY AMONG K. TWELVE STUDENTS AND THE LARGEST SOURCE OF VARIABILITY BETWEEN IDENTIFICATION RATES BETWEEN DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. NO COUNTRVAILING THIS AND THIS IS MORE OF AN ANECDOTAL POINT IS SOMETHING. THAT I THINK YOU WERE GETTING AT THIS IDEA THAT. IN MORE AFFLUENT AREAS WHERE THERE ARE MORE CUT THROAT PARENTS WERE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS AND WHAT NOT THAT THERE IS IN SOME CASES IF YOU IF YOUR CHILD THE STRUGGLING THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN. GET THEM AND I A P. AND THAT WILL GIVE THEM ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC SUPPORT WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY -- A SYSTEM GOING ON I WOULD SAY I AM NOT SEEN RIGOROUS DOCUMENTATION THAT THAT IS IN FACT HAPPENING I HAVE HEARD IT FROM THE FIELD. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS COMBINATION OF FACTORS WHICH INDICATE THAT BOTH LOW INCOME AND HIGH INCOME SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH DISABILITIES IS ONE REASON WHY THE LEISURE DOESN'T SHOW. A CLEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN INCOME. AND DISABILITY RATES. NOW. IT'S CERTAINLY JUST BRIEFLY EARLIER DOESN'T SHOW THAT CORRELATION BUT WHAT ABOUT. X. SO THAT'S JUST FLAT WHETHER THEY EXIST. THAT -- SPECIAL NEED EXISTS OR NOT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ACTUAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE NEED. YES SO I THINK THAT IS A VERY -- CURRENT OF OBSERVATION AND SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE AN ON GOING POLICY CONCERN OF COURSE THE INTENT OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT IS THAT ALL STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN WILL BE PROVIDED WITH APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT. THAT GOAL IS. NOT BEING REALIZED I THINK IS A FAIR STATEMENT -- BY THE THE QUESTION BàN HOW DO WE RECOGNIZE IN EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE FOR EVERY STUDENT WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GIVE THEM AN AYE A PEER. NINE I THINK THE LITERATURE WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE'S SOME DANGER IN TRYING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THROUGH YOUR FUNDING MECHANISM. THAT THE MORE LIKELY RESULT OF TRYING. TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE THE IDENTIFICATION THROUGH THE VERY BLUNT INSTRUMENT OF PROVIDING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH MORE OR LESS FUNDING OFTEN JUST RESULTS AND CHILDREN BEING INAPPROPRIATELY OVER IDENTIFIED WITH DISABILITIES. AND SO PERHAPS. FINDING THE MORE NUANCED ANSWER TO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CHILD WHO HAS SPECIAL NEEDS. IS BEING SO IDENTIFIED PERHAPS WE SHOULD LOOK AT OTHER POLICY TOOLS RATHER THAN FUNDING. THANK YOU HAVE A COUPLE CONVERSATION ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE. WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE. FIFTEEN DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS [inaudible] ELIA. THE GOVERNOR SENATE AND ASSEMBLY ALL APPROVED THREE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES TOTALING FORTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AND THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION ON GOING FEDERAL FIND. THE SENATE ADOPTED PLACE HOLDER LANGUAGE THAT WOULD FOCUS EACH OF THESE INITIATIVES ON ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. FOR IT INITIATIVE THAT FOCUSES ON TRAINING TEACHERS AND SPECIFIC SUBJECTS THE SENATE PROPOSES TO PROVIDE SLIGHTLY MORE FUNDING FOR TRAINING IN THE AREAS OF WRITING. READING AND LITERATURE MATH AND SCIENCE AND SLIGHTLY LESS FUNDING FOR TRAINING AND OTHER SUBJECTS. ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WITH AMENDMENTS TO INCLUDE TEACHER TRAINING ON AFFECT ON ETHNIC STUDIES. THE KEY ISSUE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS WHETHER TO TARGET THESE INITIATIVES TOWARDS SUPPORTING ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES SPECIFICALLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER HOW THESE PROPOSALS ALIGNED WITH STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT RESULTS. BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. IT INDICATES THAT THE STUDENT THAT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND FOSTER YOUTH LAGGED BEHIND THE MOST IN MATH AND ENGLISH PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OTHER STUDENT GROUPS. IN CONTRAST TO ENGLISH LEARNERS HAVE COMPARABLE OR BETTER OUTCOMES THAN MANY OTHER STUDENT GROUPS IN THESE AREAS INCLUDING AFRICAN AMERICAN HISPANIC HOMELESS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WE ALSO NOTE THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE DISTRICTS RECENTLY FLAGS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SOLELY BASED ON POOR PERFORMANCE. FROM THEIR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES BY COMPARISON ONLY FIFTY NINE DISTRICTS WERE SIMILARLY FLAG DUE TO POOR OUTCOMES FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU QUESTIONS COMMENTS. PART WEBER -- YES ONCE AGAIN -- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR RESEARCH AND INFORMATION IT SHOWS WHO THE LOWEST PERFORMING INDIVIDUALS ARE AND SO I THINK OF JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T JUST SIMPLY TARGET ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ONLY BUT THE ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. IS OBVIOUSLY A GREAT NEED BECAUSE ALL THE PHOTOS OF THE FOLKS THAT REALLY AT THE BOTTOM BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE JUST GIVEN US SO. IF WE'RE GOING TO DO STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE GREATEST NEED IS IN TERMS OF THE GAS AND WE SEE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND THOSE AREAS OF THE AREAS WHERE WE GET THE LEAST AMOUNT OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. NOT THAT WE DO AN AWFUL LOT WE DO A LOT WE DO QUITE A BIT ON ON ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS -- IN TERMS OF THE BY LEGALLY PROGRAMS AND THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN THE IN THE DISTRICTS BUT WE DO VERY LITTLE TRAINING ON ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. AND THAT CUTS ACROSS ALL OF THE AREAS WHERE OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH WITH THIS WRITTEN OR ORAL LANGUAGE AND HAVING -- THERE'S SOME NEW STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT WORK WELL -- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ART EDUCATORS ARE GETTING THAT TRAINING AND ADMINISTRATORS GET MY TRAINING SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT ENGLISH PROFICIENCY IS. AND THEY BEGAN TO TEACH AND TO DEAL WITH THE STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH. WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL WOULD NOT PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH ORALLY OR IN WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND THAT IS UNFORTUNATE. THANK YOU MA'AM. I'LL JUST SAY VERY BRIEFLY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ENVISIONS THIS IS A IN A BIG VERY MEANINGFUL PROPOSAL AND WE CERTAINLY. APPRECIATE THAT OF MUCH OF THIS WILL GO TOWARD HELPING WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND PEOPLE SPECIAL EDUCATION BY. THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY ENVISION THIS AS A BROADER PROPOSAL -- FOR TEACHER DEVELOPMENT FOR A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND GIVING LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THE FLEXIBILITY BASED ON THEIR ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THEY NEED IN THEIR DISTRICTS WHERE TO FOCUS IS WHAT THE NUMBER OF THESE RESOURCES SO IF IN THIS CASE WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. THANK YOU WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIXTEEN ONGOING KICKING TWELVE EDUCATIONAL INVESTMENT TALIA. IF YOU SIXTEEN CONSISTS OF THREE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS RELATED TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS PRACTICE REIMBURSEMENTS AND SCHOOL COUNCILS. I REALIZE WE PREVIOUSLY TOUCHED ON THIS EARLIER BUT ISSUE SIXTEEN FOR SPECIFICALLY FOCUSES ON THE ASUS PART. SO AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS BOTH HOUSES PROVIDED AUGMENTATION FOR ASUS ESTABLISHED BY PROPOSITION FORTY NINE ON THIS PROGRAM LAST RECEIVED AN INCREASE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND IT CURRENTLY RECEIVES AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION. THE CURRENT AFTER SCHOOL FUNDING RATE IS EIGHT DOLLARS IN NINETEEN CENTS PER STUDENT PER DAY. THE SENATE ACTION WOULD RAISE THIS RATE BY 17% TO NINE DOLLARS AND FIFTY EIGHT CENTS. THE ASSEMBLY ACTION WOULD RAISE IT SLIGHTLY LESS BY 14% TO NINE DOLLARS AND THIRTY ONE CENTS. THE SENATE COVERS EIGHT AUGMENTATION WITH ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FINDING WHERE AS THE ASSEMBLY ALLOCATE FUNDING FROM PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR NEXT ON SCHOOL BREAKFAST REIMBURSEMENT THE SENATE PROVIDES FIFTEEN POINT THREE ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TO ESTABLISH A CALIFORNIA. GROWN FOR HEALTHY KIDS PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TEN CENT REIMBURSEMENT FOR EACH BREAKFAST SERVED IN CERTAIN SCHOOLS OFFERING STUDENTS ACCESS TO FREE CALIFORNIA GROUND FOR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. WE NOTE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE CURRENTLY PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENT FOR MEALS SERVED TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND THE FUNDING FROM THIS POPOSAL WAY TO SUPPLEMENT THOSE SUBSIDIES. LASTLY ASSEMBLY PROVIDES ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO PRIDE NEED BASED. SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING CONFERENCES HOSTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR STUDENT COUNCIL WHICH IS A STUDENT RUN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU GREAT ALSO VERY BRIEFLY -- ON PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR AND THE ATARI STRUCK THAT FUNDING I KNOW WE ALREADY HAD THAT CONVERSATION -- AND FOR ASUS MORE SPECIFICALLY OUTSIDE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WE DO BELIEVE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF LCF PFAFF THAT IF LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES SCHOOLS WANT TO USE THAT MONEY FOR THAT PURPOSE. THEY CAN DO SO AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IN OUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE THAT WE DIRECT RESOURCES TO LC A FAST AND SPECIAL LAD AND THEN WITHIN THAT GIVE DISTRICTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES. AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA GROWN FOR HEALTHY KIDS AS WELL AS THE STUDENT COUNCIL FUNDING WE BELIEVE THAT THE SAME APPROACH I'VE NOT DIRECTING THAT IN OUR PROPOSITION NINETY PACKAGE BUT GIVING LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT IS THE RIGHT APPROACH. COMMENTS QUESTIONS. REGARDING. YEAH I I DON'T KNOW IF WHEN I GET BACK INTO HOW WE FUND IT BUT I THINK TALKING ABOUT THE ACES PROGRAM IS APPROPRIATE RIGHT HERE AND AS YOU NOTED AND AS YOU KNOW THAT EARLIER. I'M SURE MITCHELL THIS WAS THE CREATOR SORTS **** OVER A DECADE AGO AND HAD STATIC. FUNDING IN THERE WITHOUT A COLA. FOR ALL THOSE YEARS INCLUDING DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND SO THEY DID HAVE SOME SOME. FRANKLY SOME GOOD NEWS AS THEY WORK CUT DURING THE RECESSION ONE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS ARE BUT THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN ACTUALLY SEVEN YEARS NOW WE'VE BEEN INCREASING K. TWELVE FUNDING. ACES PROGRAM AND ONLY HAD INCREASE ONCE AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS THAT WE WE KNOW WE INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE IN CALIFORNIA -- CITIES HAVE AND WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WITH OUR OTHER PROGRAMS WITH AYE HSS OTHER STATEWIDE PROGRAMS AND THE REALITY IS IT'S SIMPLE MATHEMATICS -- YOU KNOW THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF KIDS YOU NEED TO SERVE -- COSCO UP SO AS I MEAN YOU SIR FEWER KIDS AND WE WE VALUE THESE PROGRAMS THEY THEY FOCUS ON IN RICHMOND FOR FOR FOR OUR KIDS PUT ON LEAVE. AT LOW INCOME BROWN TO BLACK KIDS IN CALIFORNIA -- WHO YEAH BUT FOR THIS MAY NOT HAVE IT A POSITIVE THING TO DO AFTER SCHOOL HELP SOMEONE HOMEWORK KEEP SOMATIC TROUBLE IT'S WHERE? POLICE CHIEF LOVE THESE PROGRAMS AND I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT REALISTIC TO SAY THAT. DISTRICTS WILL USE THEIR DISCRETIONARY LCF PFAFF TO PRIORITIZE THIS BECAUSE THEY DO PRIORITIZES BUT THERE ARE OTHER PRIORITIES ARE HEMORRHAGING RIGHT NOW. PAYING THE BILLS AND SO HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE SAW THAT THEY CUT BACK ON OR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND THAT DOESN'T SERVE ANYBODY WELL AND SO -- YOU KNOW BOTH THE ASSEMBLY IN THE CENTER OF ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT OURS IS. A WAS A LITTLE LOWER BECAUSE WE JUST TIED IN THE PROP. SIXTY FOUR AMOUNT BUT IF WE WANT TO VALUE THE ASUS PROGRAM AND THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND YOU THINK THEY THERE THERE WERE THE SHOULD BE FUNDED -- WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WE DID FOR THE OTHER PROGRAMS AND REALIZE THAT THESE -- COST INCREASES LABOR INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES ARE REAL AND OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST GONNA STARVE AND IN THESE PROGRAMS WILL ESSENTIALLY. GO OUT OF BUSINESS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. DUG OUT OKAY PERFECT ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVENTEEN ONE TIME K. THROUGH TWELVE PROP NINETY EIGHT INVESTMENTS ELIA. YES SO ISSUE SEVENTEEN INCLUDES EIGHT LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. FOR ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES -- WE WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE JUST HIGHLIGHT THE TWO LARGEST WOULD BE THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION FOR THE COLLEGE READINESS BLOCK GRANT THIS -- PROVIDES FOR A FREE LOW INCOME -- ENGLISH LEARNER A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT MAY EQUAL PER A STERN FUNDING. AMOUNT -- FOR WHICH UP. APPLICABLE DISTRICTS MUST SUBMIT A PLAN FOR HOW THEY WILL IMPROVE COLLEGE GOING RATE FOR THOSE STUDENTS. AND THE ASSEMBLY IS PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION FOR THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS BLOCK GRANT WHICH WOULD PROVIDE AGAIN EQUAL PER PUPIL FUNDING. FOR STUDENTS MEETING THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS THAT THEY DID NOT MEET STATEWIDE STANDARDS AND THE MOST RECENT ASSESSMENTS OF READING AND MATH. AND THAT THEY DO NOT BELONG -- TO ANY OF THESE TARGETED GROUPS LOW INCOME. ENGLISH LEARNERS FOSTER YOUTH HOMELESS YOUTH OR SENSE WITH DISABILITIES -- OUR OVERALL COMMENTS -- CONSISTENT WITH HER EARLIER COMMENTS ARE THE WE ENCOURAGE YOU AS PART OF YOUR OVERALL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. TO INCLUDE A MIX OF BOTH ONE TIME AN ON GOING FUNDING THE MORE ONE TIME FUNDING TO DEDICATE THE LARGER YOUR CUSHION -- AND ALSO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU DEDICATE. ONE TIME FUNDS WE WOULD -- ENCOURAGE YOU. TO PROVIDE FLEXIBLE FUNDING SOURCES THAT ALLOW SCHOOLS. TO PURSUE ANY NUMBER OF LOCAL PRIORITIES. MINISTRATION YEAH VERY BRIEFLY ON THE COLLEGE READINESS BLOCK GRAND -- THERE AT SOME MORE TO THE ROOT MOST THAT PREVIOUS ISSUE WE BELIEVE THAT DISTRICTS CAN APPROACH THAT FOR LCS FAST AND I THINK GET FINANCE WERE. STILL LOOKING AT THE DATA AND IT'S NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR THAT THE PROGRAM IS ACHIEVING EVERYTHING. GAD THAT WARRANTS THIS FULL REINVESTMENT PROPOSED BY THE SENATE -- AND THEN ON THE LOW PERFORMING STUDENTS BLOCK GRANT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT -- THIS FUNDING IS A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE IN THE SENSE OF WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR MORE OUTCOME DATA AND THAT. FULL AMOUNT OF FOR THAT MOST RECENT PREPARATION HAS JUST BEEN EXPENDED [inaudible] COMMENTS QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ISSUE EIGHTEEN K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION INVESTMENTS ELIA. IF YOU EIGHTEEN CONSISTS OF TWO PROPOSALS THE MOST NOTABLE ISSUE IS THAT THE GOVERNOR AND ASSEMBLY PROVIDES FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND FIBER BROADBAND AT SCHOOLS THAT ARE CONSIDERED POORLY CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. THE SENATE REJECTED THIS PROPOSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE. WHEN THE GOVERNOR INTRODUCED THIS PROPOSAL AND THE ME REVISION WE HAD CONCERNS OVER THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY SPECIFICITY CONCERNING? HOW THE STATE WOULD MEASURE THE NEED FOR IMPROVED CONNECTIVITY AS WELL AS HOW IT WOULD ASSESS PROGRESS TOWARDS ADEQUATE CONNECTIVITY? IF THE COMMITTEE DOES DECIDE TO PROCEED WITH THAT THE PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND IT IMPROVE THE PROPOSAL BY FIRST DEFINING WHAT POOR CONNECTIVITY AND ADEQUATE CONNECTIVITY MEAN. TO YOU ALLOWING SCHOOLS TO USE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE CONNECTED BE SOLUTION RATHER THAN LIMITING GRANTS TO SOLELY FIBER SOLUTIONS AND THREE ADDING REPORTING LANGUAGE TO ENHANCE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. FOR THE SECOND PROPOSAL IN ISSUE EIGHTEEN THE GOVERNOR SENATE AND ASSEMBLY EXPLAINS ALL CONTAIN SOME FEDERAL FUNDING FOR HOMELESS YOUTH BUT HAVE DIFFERENCES IN RESPECT TO HOW THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED. THE GOVERNOR AND SENATE APPROVED AN INCREASE TO LOCAL ASSISTANCE TO ALIGN WITH THE FEDERAL GRANTS AND AVAILABLE FUNDING. THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE LOCAL ASSISTANCE FOR HOMELESS STUDENT SERVICES IN ORDER TO FIND THREE ADDITIONAL STATEWIDE COULDN'T COORDINATORS CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS. ONE WE ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THESE FUNDS ARE BEST BET AUGMENTING LOCAL OP ASSISTANCE OR STATE OPERATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRICTION OF ALL SAY JUST VERY BRIEFLY ON THE BROADBAND AT THAT IS A IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND REALLY FOCUSED ON RESOURCES THAT. DO NOT SIMPLY ALLOW FOR COMPUTER BASED ASSESSMENTS BUT ACTUAL. GIVING MORE ACCESS TO DIGITAL LEARNING SO WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS ON THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. QUESTION FOR MEMBERS. THOROUGH. WITH RESPECT TO THE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE I'M CERTAINLY NINE OF SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING SURE SCHOOLS -- HAVE THAT SORT OF CONNECTIVITY WHAT DID WAS THERE ANY SORT OF ASSESSMENT AS TO WHAT THE NEED. WAS OR IS. YES SO SO THERE ARE -- A FEW DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT THE THE DIFFERENT A SCHOOL DISTRICT ABILITIES TO ACCESS WHAT WOULD PUT ONE COULD CONSIDER HIGH SPEED INTERNET ARE ACROSS THE STATE AND IT REALLY. DEPENDS UPON HOW YOU DEFINE -- WHAT HIGH SPEED IS -- WE KNOW THAT FOR MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS WE RECENTLY HAD YOU KNOW FUNDING GO OUT THROUGH OUR BIG PROGRAM BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM -- THAT WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD ADMINISTER THE THE ASPECT THAT THE COMPUTER BASED ASSESSMENTS OUR STATE -- AND WE KNOW FROM THAT WORK THAT THERE ARE MANY WHO HAD -- AS TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS PUT IN PLACE TO ACCESS -- THE INTERNET AT A SPEED THAT A LOT FOR THOSE ASSESSMENTS -- BUT THAT THERE IS SOME NEED TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THOSE AGAIN AND SEE IF -- AN OPTION LIKE FIBER COULD BE IS THE REASON I BRING UP FIBERS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR SCALING UP OF INTERNET SPEED -- AS AS CAPACITY GROWS -- I THINK WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN -- AT ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT -- YOU KNOW DEPENDING AGAIN ON WHICH MEASURE YOU LOOK AT AND THERE ARE SOME DISTRICTS THAT HAVE VERY LOW ACCESS SPEEDS -- IN COMPARISON TO OTHER DISTRICTS AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT LIMITS A STUDENT'S ABILITY -- TO TO ACCESS OR DIGITAL LEARNING TYPE pOF ENVIRONMENT AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING ACCESS TO THE STATE ASSESSMENTS. IS THE REASON I ASK MY QUESTION IS OF YOU KNOW WHY FIFTEEN MILLION IS SUPPOSED TO THIRTY WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM IF IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO US AND TO THE ASSEMBLY US ON THE SENATE SIDE THE ASSEMBLY. TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS ARE HAVE CONNECTIITY. AND IT'S A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM THEN MAYBE WE NEED TO FIND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND FIX THE PROBLEM. I'M JUST TRYING. TO UNDERSTAND FIFTEEN THE REGIS PICK A NUMBER OR WAS IT BASED ON SOME. ECHO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE END HERE. FOR YES THE QUESTION HOW DID WE GET -- TO FIFTEEN THERE IS NO SECRET IN THE SAUCE ON THIS ONE I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS HIS INITIAL INVESTMENT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE FARTHEST BEHIND. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE INTEND TO LOOK AT FOUR AM OUR NEXT BUDGET PROCESS IS A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT CONNECTIVITY INNER INTERSTATE THROUGHOUT FIRST ALL OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND HOW WE CAN CREATE. A LARGER PLAN -- TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES MOVING FORWARD GOT IT AT ALL SAY TO WEST FOR QUICK THINGS FIRST AS JESSICA MENTIONED FIFTY MILLION IS A MODEST INITIAL INVESTMENT WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONNECT ALL THE SCHOOLS THAT NEED BROADBAND WITH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. BUT THE SECOND TING THING TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE STUDY OF DAYS -- IN ADDITION TO THE EFFORTS CHASKA MENTION THE MINISTRATIONS ALSO PUTTING TOGETHER ITS ANNUAL FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN AND PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON THAT AND WHEN THAT IS RELEASED IT WILL HAVE A COMPONENT. FOCUSED DIRECTLY ON THIS ISSUE WHEN WHICH SHOULD INFORM NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET COVER SELECTS YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT WILL TRANSITION. TO ISSUE. NINETEEN K. TWELVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. KENNETH COUPON WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE THIS ITEM COVERS FOR DIFFERENCES IN TRAILER LEGISLATION TRIED LEGISLATION AFFECTING K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. FIRST THE GOVERNOR AND SENATE APPROVED LANGUAGE THAT EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS CHARTER SCHOOLS FROM DISCOURAGING ENROLLMENT FOR ANY REASON. I INCLUDING A STUDENTS PASS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OR DISABILITY STATUS. BY THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THAT CHANGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENDING IT TO POLICY COMMITTEE. ISSUE IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IS WHETHER TO ADOPT THOSE CHANGES NOW OR TO FOR THEM TO THE POLICY COMMITTEE TO IRON OUT A FEW REMAINING ISSUES. A SECOND ALL THREE PLANS ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT A MORE STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR MONITORING MOTHER TEACHERS. IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE A STATE CREDENTIAL FOR THE SUBJECT THEIR TEACHING. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO EXTEND THE STATE'S CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE MONITORING -- TO ALL CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS NOT JUST THOSE IN CHRIST SUBJECT AREAS. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU AND CONFERENCE IS WHETHER TO MAINTAIN. THE CREDENTIAL FLEXIBILITY CHARTER SCHOOLS CURRENTLY HAVE FOR THEIR NON CORE TEACHER IS WHETHER TO APPLY THE SAME REQUIREMENTS TO ALL TEACHERS IN THE STATE. THIRD OF THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR APPROVED LANGUAGE ALLOWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED EMERGENCY LOANS TO PAY. A FULL SALARY TO RETIRED ADMINISTRATORS WHO ARE WE HIRED INTO THEIR FORMER POSITIONS. AT THE ISSUE AND CONFERENCE AS WELL THEY TO MAKE THAT PROVISION ON GOING AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. A SUNSET AFTER TWO YEARS AS THE SENATE PROPOSES OR REJECTED ENTIRELY AS THE ASSEMBLY AT PROPOSES. FINALLY BOTH HOUSES APPROVED LANGUAGE ALLOWING THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO EXCEED THE MAXIMUM RATIO OF ADMINISTRATORS TO TEACHERS WITHOUT FACING A FISCAL PENALTY. THE ISSUE IN CONFERENCES WITH THAT PROVIDE THAT WAIVER FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AS THE SENATE APPROVED. OR FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS AS THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED. OF THOSE FOUR ISSUES -- NONE ARE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO A SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION OR A BUDGET ACTION. ALL OF THEM TO SOME EXTENT TO INVOLVE A SOME IMPORTANT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS FOR YOU. AND SO WE THINK. IF YOU WANTED TO DEFERRED THESE ISSUES TO A POLICY COMMITTEE COULD CERTAINLY FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING THAT. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OF FINANCE A VERY BRIEFLY WE SUPPORT THE SENATE APPROACH ON THESE ISSUES AND WE BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE CONVERSATION AROUND EDUCATION AND THE FOCUS ON IT FOR THIS BUDGET PROCESS. THAT THESE ISSUES ARE GERMANE AND SHOULD BE DEALT WITH THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. THREE MORE LOT. MORE PHILOSOPHICAL MADAM CHAIR BUT NO I DID. WE HAD A CONVERSATION THIS MORNING WITH ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AND IN OTHER SERVICE AT WORK REAL HARD TO PUT BILLS THROUGH COMMITTEES AND THEN. GET THEM ON THE FLOOR IN. GAME APPROVED IN IN AND I'M JUST WONDERING. WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE TRAILER BILLS THIS YEAR WE'RE SAME OLD SAME OLD -- OR OR BECAUSE BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE WORKING ON FINANCES NOT POLICY RIGHT IN THIS COMMITTEE. TIME JUST KIND OF CURIOUS. SOME. WHAT I GUESS IT DEPENDS? ON A MONTH PERSPECTIVE I THINK IN OUR EXPERIENCE THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WE HAD AN ADMINISTRATION THAT TENDED TO DO QUITE A BIT OF POLICY -- IN THE BUDGET -- AND I KNOW CERTAINLY MY MY VICE CHAIR OF THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS -- FREQUENTLY EXPRESSES HIS -- THIS MAY WITH THE TRAILER BILL -- EXPERIENCE AS AS IT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS -- AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT THEY PUT FOR THE BUDGET AND TRY TO THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NEAR VERY WELCOME. ANY OTHER QUITE THIS OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT. TO EXPAND ON THE COMMENTS. IN PARTICULAR REGARDING THE CHARTER SCHOOL ENROLLMENT FEES. BOB FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH. THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WITHOUT A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN THE ASSEMBLY THIS YEAR -- MANY MANY HOURS OF TESTIMONY MANY MANY HOURS OF DEBATE I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REALLY ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. IS PART OF THE BUDGETARY PROCESS INSIDE DOES STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY ACTION ON THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THANK YOU. GIVE US ONE QUICK SECOND THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK IN YOUR MANY HOURS AT RIGHT [inaudible] YEAH. THE CANNELLA FAR SOMETHING. FOR FUN. I HEARD THAT. JUST LIKE LINED UP YES. THAT WAS VERY TELL THE PM -- THE FINNISH ISSUE NINETEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A LINE AT THE SIDE BAR WILL MOVE ON NOW. TO ISSUE TWENTY STUDENTS CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON ELIA. AND COROLLA THE LA ALSO THIS ITEM -- STUDENT CENTRE FUNNY PURGATORY BROUGHT A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND BEFORE WE GET INTO THE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES SO JUST AS A REMINDER LAST YEAR THE STATE ADOPTED A NEW FUNDING FORMULA FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WHICH CONSISTS OF THREE COMPONENTS ONE BASED FUNDING THAT'S BASED ON ENROLLMENT. TWO OF FUNDING THAT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. AND THEN THREE OUTCOMES BASED FUNDING BASED ON PRIMARILY NUMBER OF US ASSOCIATE DEGREES CERTIFICATES NUMBER SOON TO TRANSFER. I'M. THIRTY THERE BEEN SOME CONCERNS WITH -- IN THE FIRST YEAR WITH SOME OF THE RELIABILITY QUALITY OF THIS TO NOW COME DATA SO THE GOOD MINISTRATION AT SOME -- TO KEEP PROPOSALS IN THIS BUDGET BETTER IT BEFORE YOU FOR CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. THE FIRST IS. TO IT SHOULD STOP TO THINK THAT THE STUDENT OUTCOMES PORTION OF THE FORMULA -- IS SCHEDULED UNDER CURRENT LAW TO INCREASE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IT'S ABOUT 10% OF THE FORMULA OF THE TOTAL FOR NEW ACOSTA. GROWING 215% NINETEEN TWENTY AND-THEN 220% IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FIRST IS TO POSTPONE THAT SCHEDULED INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF THE FORMULAS BASED ON OUTCOMES. AND THEN SECOND GIVEN SOME OF THE CONCERNS WITH THE STUDENT OUTCOMES FUNDING TO CAP THE ANNUAL GROWTH IN THE AMOUNT THAT ANY INDIVIDUAL COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE STRICKEN RECEIVED FROM. UNDERSTOOD OUTCOMES PORTION OF THE FORMULA. EACH OF THE THOUSANDS TOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ACTIONS THE THE TWO PIECES OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT DIDN'T. TAKE ON THE ENTIRE THING SO THE SENATE -- ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO DELAY THE THE SCHEDULED INCREASE IN THE THE PORTION OF THE FORMULAS BASED ON STUDENT OUTCOMES -- BUT THEN IN TERMSINSTEAD OF APPLYING THIS CAP YOUR YOUR GROWTH TO THE TO THE OUTCOMES PORTION INSTEAD -- MAKES TO POLICY CHANGES ONE IS TO CALCULATE THAT PORTION BASED ON A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE JUST TWO NOW COMES TO SMOOTH OUT THE COSTS. AND THEN SECOND -- PROVIDED FUNDING -- ONLY FOR THE HIGHEST DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE EARNED BY STUDENT IN THAT PARTICULAR YEAR NOT JUST -- ANY NUMBER OR FOR ANY -- OR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEGREES TO FORGET THE STUDENT EARNS THAT YEAR. THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS POSE -- TO KEEP IN PLACE THE CURRENT -- OF FUNDING FORMULA RATES OF THAT MOVING FORWARD ONLY 10% OF THE FORMULA WOULD. BE BASED ON STUDENT OUTCOMES -- BUT DID ADOPT -- THE FUNDING FORMULA -- CAP ON THE STUDENTS ON THE STUDENT OUTCOMES PORTION SO -- DIFFERENT APPROACHES THE SENATE PHYSIQUE MODIFYING HOW WE TREAT OTHERS TO NOT COME PERSONAL FORMULA THE ASSEMBLY THE KEY CHANGES. TO LOCK IN PLACE THE PORTION THE FRONT OF THE FUNDING FORMULA BASED ON STUDENT OUTCOMES. ARE WE ACTUALLY RECOMMEND THE SENATE VERSION HERE WITHIN THE SENATE VERSION ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT -- WE'VE SEEN WITH SOME OF THE DATA BY -- CREATING A MUCH MUCH MORE -- A SMOOTHER BUT YOUR YOUR CHANGE IN THAT IN FUNDING BY USING A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE. AND BY USING ONLY THE HIGHEST DEGREE EARNED WOULD AVOID SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT FROM -- PEOPLE PEOPLE ABOUT ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR EXAMPLE I COULD YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATES TO GET ADDITIONAL FUNDING. ONLY AT ONE POINT WHICH IS THAT HE PLAN TO EXPLORE WHAT WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REVISIONS TO THE FUNDING FORMULA IN THE UPCOMING YEAR -- BUT FOR NOW WE WE BELIEVE IN A REVISION IS THE BEST APPROACH. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU SEE NONE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY ONE ONLINE COLLEGE ELIA. THIS IS A THIS IS A AND ASSEMBLY ACTION THE GOVERNOR AND SENATE HAD NO PROPOSAL. ON THE JUST BE BRIEF BACKGROUND YES ABOUT YESTERDAY LAST YEAR -- THE STATE ADOPTED AS PART OF THE TEAM NINETEEN BUDGET I CREATED A NEW ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- THE IN THAT FIRST YEAR THAT ONLY CAN YOU CALL JUST PROVIDED WITH ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING THAT COULD BE SPENT OVER SEVEN YEARS. AND IN ADDITION WAS OPERATE WITH TWENTY MILLION THAT IT WOULD RECEIVE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE ASSEMBLY ACTION IS. TO TWO PIECES FIRST IT'S TO REDUCE THE ONGOING FUNDING ABOUT FROM TWENTY MILLION TO FIVE MILLION. AND THEN IT WOULD BE TOOK THE SECOND OPTION WOULD BE TO TAKE FIFTY MILLION OF THE HUNDRED MILLION PROVIDED A ONE TIME FUNDING LAST YEAR -- AND USE IT FOR OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE PURPOSES. AND I'LL ADD THAT DAIS ONLINE COLLEGES RAMPING UP ITS OPERATIONS IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ENROLLING STUDENTS THIS FALL SO THE GOVERNOR BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE REDUCING FUNDING AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU IN THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] THOROUGH. BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT OF FIFTH OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME WAS TO BE USED FOR START UP OVER SIXTY SEVEN YEARS. SEVEN YEARS WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT OF TAKING FIFTY MILLION. AWAY FROM THAT OF BUCKET -- TO USE FOR OTHER PURPOSES DURING THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR. PERHAPS WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGES DOING. IN THE IN OUR RUN UP TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. AND MAKING FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION YES AND WE DON'T SO IN TERMS OF THE SHORT TERM WE DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF IMMEDIATE EFFECTS -- THE AND THE FOLKS FOR THE ONLY COMMITTEE CALLED PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION AND NONE OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING ACTUALLY BEEN SPENT I THINK WHEN WE ARE. CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM IN MARCH -- ARE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS OF THE ONGOING FUNDING HAD BEEN SPENT. AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME BAD LEVERAGE SOME OF PHILANTHROPY DOLLARS TO HAVE TO START SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES SO THAT'S MOSTLY WHAT EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN THIS ONE TIME FUNDING IS AVAILABLE WE DON'T THINK IT HAS AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON THEIR ON THEIR ACTIVITIES. BUT THAT BEING SAID TO BE THEY ARE EXPECTED THEY WOULD HAVE THIS FUNDING FOR SEVEN YEARS AND IF YOU'RE REDUCING THAT AMOUNT AND HALF AND THAT DOES MEAN THAT THEY'RE LIKELY THEY WILL LIKELY NEED TO CHANGE WITH OUR LONG TERM PLAN IS IN TERMS OF WHAT. WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE PILING ON SPENDING? AT THIS POINT WE HADN'T RECEIVED THE SPECIFIC DETAIL PLAN ON HOW THAT HUNDRED MILLION WAS TO BE SPENT WE CAN GIVE YOU ANY SPECIFICITY IN TERMS OF WITH SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES WOULD BE REMOVED. BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE. THERE ARE THREE ONLINE COLLEGE pGOING TO ROLL OUT. IN AUGUST WITH CLASSES BEGINNING IN OCTOBER I GATHER THEN THAT REDUCING THE ONE TIME BUCKET FROM A HUNDRED TO FIFTY MILLION IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO IMPACT THOSE THREE ONLINE PROGRAMS. THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE OUR THAT WOULD BE OUR EXPECTATION IT IS MOVING FORWARD AT OTHER PROGRAMS RAMPING UP WITH THE CHANGES WOULD BE. DID DID THEY DID THE ONLINE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ADMINISTRATORS GIVE YOU ANY IDEA OF WHAT THEY EARN NEXT WITH THE FOLLOW UP PLANS ARE FOLLOWING PLANS ARE FOR ONLINE PROGRAMS. GIVE ME IN REGARDS TO THE THE REDUCTION OF THE FIFTY NINE DOLLAR NO BEYOND THE THREE PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE APPARENTLY GOING TO START IN OCTOBER AMMAR. I HAVE NOT HEARD OF IT SPECIFIC I KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN -- LOOKING INTO POTENTIAL WHAT THROUGH THOSE OTHER PATHWAYS WOULD BE I KNOW THAT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO I BELIEVE GET TO UP TO TEN PATHWAYS THAT THEY WOULD BE DEVELOPING -- BUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY SPECIFIC. JUST THAT THEY ARE STILL LOOKING INTO WHAT UP WITH THOSE PAST MIGHT BE AND WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST. OPTIONS THAT MIGHT THAT THEY COULD CONNECT EMPLOYERS IN THIS INSTANCE WITH. AND MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS FERGUSON HAS SOME COMMENTS AS WELL CERTAINLY I THINK WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IF YOU WERE TO REDUCE THAT FIFTY MILLION IT STARTS TO CHANGE. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICE TOOL FOR WILL BE WOULD BE CREATED AND PROVIDED TO THE STUDENTS. IT WOULD IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL -- PATHWAYS MOVING FORWARD SO CERTAINLY I THINK. YOU KNOW I JUST LIKE TO TAKE IT BACK TO REALLY THE UP THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE AND THAT IS WE KNOW THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE SOME COLLEGE BUT NO DEGREE. IT'S IN THE MILLIONS WE KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- AND OUR GOAL IS TO TRY AND IMPROVE ECONOMIC MOBILITY THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS SO TO THE EXTENT YOU WERE. TO PRODUCE FOR RE DIRECT THOSE RESOURCES TOWARDS OTHER PURPOSES -- IT WOULD CERTAINLY UNDERMINE THAT BROUGHT GOAL. WELL I MEAN MY GUESS THE REASON I'M ASKED WE SENATE HAD NO PROPOSAL ON THIS BUT I'M. REVIEWING THE ASSEMBLY IS PROPOSAL AND I'M TRYING. TO TO SORT OF NOODLE THIS OUT -- THIS ONE HUNDRED MILLION WAS APPROPRIATED IN THE LAST BUDGET PROCESS. AND IF ONE MILLION OF THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT -- AND WE'RE MOVING INTO THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY AND INCREASED THE BURN RATE. BETTER PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RATE OF TO TO BURN THROUGH FIFTY MILLION LET ALONE ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR AND OF COURSE BUDGET. BEING OF MATTER BALANCING PRIORITIES WHICH YOU WILL DO ALL THE TIME AND WE TRY TO PLAY IN THAT GAME. OF IF THERE'S ANOTHER USE FOR THE MONEY TEMPORARILY WE MADE I WANT TO PUT THAT TO A DIFFERENT USE. I THINK I I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM A NOTE THAT THE ONLINE COLLEGES BUDGET WAS RECENTLY -- TAKEN BEFORE THE THE ONLINE CULTURES BORDER YEAH I BELIEVE IT HAD BROOKLEY FORTY EIGHT MILLION AND PLANNED EXPENDITURES FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR SO THERE CERTAINLY WORKING TOWARDS EXPENDING THESE. RESOURCES I THINK I WOULD APPLAUD THEM IN BEING PRUDENT IN THEIR USE OF THESE RESOURCES -- AND TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE BEST VALUE FOR OUR DOLLAR. OKAY THAT SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU VENTURE THANK YOU MISS SKINNER FOLLOWED BY MR TING. DID I HEAR YOU CORRECTLY THAT YOU JUST SAID THEY PLAN TO SPEND FORTY EIGHT MILLION JUST NEXT YEAR. FOR MORE MONEY AFTER THE FOR YES SAID AT THE GOAL OF THAT IS BOTH ONE TIME AND ONGOING EXPENDITURES TO DEVELOP AND ACQUIRE TECHNOLOGY. TO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE'VE ONLY ALRIGHT THIS WHAT WAS AUTHORIZED LAST YEAR WAS A HUNDRED MILLION ON YOU KNOW OVER THE SEVEN YEARS AND TWENTY MILLION OPERATIONAL IF THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND FORTY EIGHT MILLION OF IN ONE YEAR. THEN IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THEY'RE EXPECTING US TO GIVE THEM QUITE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY STARTING IN THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR. BUT THAT SEEMS PRETTY BIG LEAP. WELL I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THAT IS ROUGHLY ONE QUARTER OF THE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR AND YOU WOULD. LIKE TO SEE THE BIGGEST EXPENSES IN THAT FIRST YEAR -- SO THE THIS PROGRAM OR RATHER. ONLINE COURSES WAS NOT CONTROVERSIAL. IN THE DISCUSSIONS. AROUND -- IN FACT MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND DISTRICTS DO OFFER ONLINE COURSES AND THERE WAS A LOT OF SENTIMENT -- TO THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD TAKE THE APPROACH OF SUPPORTING THE PROPOSAL POINTED OUT SUCH THINGS AS THERE WOULDN'T EVEN BE ACCREDITATION OF THIS A CENTRALIZED ONLINE PROPOSAL -- COLLEGE AND FOR YEARS AND THAT THERE WAS EXISTENCE OF THESE PROGRAMMES ELSEWHERE AND THERE COULD BE -- YOU KNOW WE COULD EITHER DISTRIBUTE -- FUNDS ACROSS THE STATE OR PICK CERTAIN REGIONS THAT YOU KNOW MY EITHER. HAVE MOST APPETITE FOR IT -- HIGHEST NEED -- BUT THE ADMINISTRATION. WAS VERY -- SET. ON THIS PROPOSAL AND AS I INDICATE THERE WA A IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL. AND SO I WONDER GIVEN THAT. THE THE PROGRAM IS ONLY SPENT HIS IS INDICATED. THAT. A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DATE AND EVEN IF THEY PLAN TO SPEND ANOTHER FORTY MILLION WHICH SEEMS PRETTY. DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE IN THE FIRST YEAR -- WHETHER WE ARE WISER RE VISITING THAT CONCEPT OF STRENGTHENING THE ABILITY OF OUR COMMUNITY CALL EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS THAT HAPPENED PREDATION. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ONLINE COURSES. END OF THESE PATHWAYS COULD NOT BE FULFILLED THROUGH THAT. SO I WOULD NOT THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET DID INCLUDE SOME ONE TIME FUNDING I THINK GOES THROUGH THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. THAT WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE FUNDING -- THAT WOULD GO OUT ITS GRANTS -- TO THE FOR TRADITIONAL CAM YOU COLLEGES SO THAT THEY COULD DEVELOP THEM ONLINE PROGRAMS BUT THOSE PROGRAMS WE COULD POTENTIALLY ALIGNED WITH. SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE EVEN IF THERE ISN'T AN ACCREDITATION -- OR AN ACCREDITATION AUTHORITY THAT HAS ACCREDITED THE PROGRAM THAT EMPLOYERS WILL I KNOW THE PROGRAM WELL ENOUGH THAT THEY WILL HAVE BUT THEY WILL BE -- WILLING TO HIRE -- INDIVIDUALS TO COMPLETE THOSE PROGRAMS THE NIGHTMARE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I AM INTRIGUED BY THE ASSEMBLY RECOMMENDATION THIS IS. THIS IS REALLY COOL -- THIS WAS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL ITEM LAST YEAR. AND THE CAMPUSES OF FOR THAT WHAT WAS SEVENTY TWO OTHER DISTRICTS FOR WERE NOT AMUSED BY THE PROPOSAL IN. ELOY OAKLEY THE CHANCER LOBBY. PRETTY AGGRESSIVELY. TO GET THIS THING OFF THE GROUND -- SERVICE ONE OF THE VINE AND THEN CHOOSE ME -- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE HAVING A TOUGH TIME -- TO JUST LOOK AT THIS WEEK AT LA. LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THEIR UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT. FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION AND FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT'S ONE BILLION. THIRTY FOUR TO WIN A FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE YEAR WHICH WOULD BE PROBABLY THE OPEN UP THE OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. AND I DOUBT THEY HAVE A PROGRAM TO START PAYING THAT DOWN LIKE YOU DO. AND INTO THESE COLLEGES ARE GOING TO COME TO US. AND TO HELP US OUT WE CAN WE WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUB TO NICKELS TOGETHER TO START. ATTACKING. THIS PROBLEM THIS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS LIKE I I SIT HERE I I SAY WHY DO WE START A NEW PROGRAM. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SEVENTY TWO AND A? SEVEN TWO SEVENTY ONE SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS. HUNDRED FORTY FOUR CAMPUS I SHOULD AND I DON'T HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS MEMORIES BUT WHY ARE WE DOING SOMETHING NEW AND INNOVATIVE IN EXPENSIVE WHEN WHEN WE'VE GOT. STAGGERING NUMBERS SOME STAGGERING NUMBERS TO LOOK AT AND SO IT KIND OF GIVES ME THAT LET'S GET REAL MOMENT. BY COULD STEAL A PHRASE -- BUT THE I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SHOULD REALLY REEVALUATE. THIS WHOLE ENDEAVOR. I'M. YOU ALREADY LOOKED AT A COUPLE OF OTHER. INITIATIVES BY OUR FORMER GOVERNOR A GOVERNOR BROWN AND I I THINK. HE WOULD DO THE CITIZENS A SERVICE BY TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THIS ONE AS WELL. THANK YOU MANAGER. I'LL MAKE YOU VERY -- BRIEF COMMENTS -- AND DON'T WHATEVER HURTS THE DEBATE THAT I KNOW ALL THE PARTS SPENT LAST YEAR BUT JUST TWO QUICK THINGS I THINK. FIRST IS THAT -- FOR SAYS WITH GOVERNOR BROWN THIS PROPOSAL WAS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT INDIVIDUALS IN THE WORK FORCE YOU DON'T HAVE A CREDENTIAL AND WHO FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT I KNOW YOU'VE DISCUSSED OF MIND ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM SO WE DIED -- I GUESS GOVERNOR BROWN DODD AND GOT THIRTY SOME AGREES -- WE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY TO REACH THEM -- AND THEN THE SECOND POINT TO YOUR POINT ABOUT COST PRESSURES IS THAT ANY NEW INITIATIVE REQUIRES SOME START UP COSTS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT INITIATIVE LIKE THIS. IF RUN WHILE WILL SERVE THE STUDENTS POSSIBLY AT A LOWER COST. AND I I I UNDERSTAND IT'S A NOBLE CONCEPT. NOBLE CAUSE. BUT I I'M NOT GOING TO BUY MY WIFE A DIAMOND RING WHEN I'VE GOT. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CREDIT CARD DEBT. A LITTLE MORE DEAD COME ON NOW. I'M JUST SAYING I'M JUST SAYING IN. IF IF IF OUR HOUSE ISN'T IN ORDER. ONE GRADUAL LIKE THAT -- YEAH. SHE'S BEEN WITH ME FOR ALMOST THIRTY NINE YEARS BABY AND I HAVE BEEN REALLY BLESSED. THANK YOU KNOW THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE AN THAT IS YOU DON'T BUY A LUXURY ITEM. WHEN YOU'RE DE YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN THE WHEN YOUR? HOUSEHOLD BANK STATEMENTS ARE TELLING YOU MAY BE WITH WE GOTTA FOCUS SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU KNOW I'M NOT. I'M JUST I'M JUST SAY IN WHICH WE WERE GONNA HAVE SOMETHING COMING OUT OF FRONT PORCH. SOON IF WE HAVE A RECESSION IT'S GOING TO BE AWFUL AND SO THAT'S WHY. I JUST WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER MOORE LE CAMILLA TO STOP BY YOUR HEAD. MR TING FOLLOWED BY. TING FALL BY MISTER. MAYES. THANK YOU SIR JUST A QUICK POINT OF CLARIFICATION TO ALEJO -- SO DOWN. SIR AT THIS POINT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAS BEEN A MILLION. AND IT'SONE MILLION OUT OF THE TWENTY MILLION ON GOING. THAT WAS THAT WAS OUR OUR UNDERSTANDING IT I THINK THIS INFORMATION IS FROM FROM MARCH OR APRIL SO IT'S OKAY IT COULD CHANGE THAT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING AT THAT TIME BUT BUT ROUGHLY IN THE KNOWN AS OF MARCH OR APRIL IS A MILLION OUT OF THE TWENTY MILLION ON GOING. PLUS THERE IS THE OTHER. HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME. IS THAT CORRECT RESEARCH ONE MILLION OUT OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE SO IT'S I GUESS GOING BACK. TO FINANCE WHY NOT. AGAIN. IF THE MONEY'S NOT GETTING SPEND WHY NT. SPEND SOME OF THE MONEY OR HALF THE MONEY THIS YEAR ANOTHER ONE TIME THINGS WE'VE LISTED OFF. DAD CAPITAL ITEMS THAT REALLY COULD BE USED INSTEAD OF KEEPING AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- BANK ACCOUNT SINCE. THEY THEY SAY THEY HAVE A PLAN BEEN BEEN FAIRLY. HAVE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME EXECUTING. BUT I WOULD SAY IS THEY HAVE A PLAN TO RAMP UP AND THEY ARE RAMPING UP IN THEIR HIRING STAFF. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE MOVING DOWN THAT PATHWAY AND THAT TAKES TIME -- BUT CERTAINLY I THINK. WE THINK THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED WILL BE NECESSARY OVER THAT SEVEN YEAR PERIOD TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGE TO SUPPORT THE STUDENT. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT'S IT'S THAT GOAL RIGHT OF SERVING THOSE STUDENTS WHILE WE THINK THOSE RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO DO THAT. RIGHT BUT AS AS WOULD BE TYPICAL WE WOULD NOT. TRADITIONAL PREPARATION IS APPROPRIATIONS SPENT OVER TWO YEARS WE WE DON'T APPROPRIATE IN GENERAL UNLESS FOR DOING CONTAINS APPROPRIATION WITH THE IDEA THAT WE'RE SPENDING SOMETHING SEVEN YEARS. DOWN THE LINE SO WHY. WHY WHY IS IT SO IMPERATIVE? FOR HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BE SITTING IN THE CHANCELLOR'S BANK ACCOUNT RATHER THAN. BEING USED BY THE STATE FOR DEBT REPAYMENTS ARE THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. AGAIN I THINK I JUST GO BACK -- TO THEY WERE SET ASIDE TO WHAT THE A PLAN IN MIND TO EXPAND THEM ON THAT COLLEGE ON THE FRONT AND SO CERTAINLY IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT BUDGET RESILIENCY BY HAVING THOSE PROGRAM TODAY -- THOSE ARE GOING TO BE FUTURE EXPENSES PROGRAM TOMORROW. UNDERSTOOD THE JUST ECHOING MY PLACE MY SENATE COLLEAGUES THAT HAD DIFFICULT TIME. EXECUTING AND AND SPENDING THAT MONEY SO -- AT WHAT POINT DO WE SAY PERHAPS -- THESE ARE. NICE PLANS BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING DONE AND WE WANT THE MONEY BACK BECAUSE WE WE JUST WENT THROUGH YOU KNOW THREE THREE PLUS HOURS ON K. TWELVE AN AFTER SCHOOL AND WE STARTED WITH THE VERVIEW AND THE DDS. THE ITEM FROM CENTS FIFTY YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH ARE. PRIORITIES RIGHT THESE ARE NOT THESE ARE NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SO. SO WHILE THE CHANCELLOR'S GOT A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN HIS ACCOUNT WE'RE GONNA TELL SENIORS AND DISABLED FAMILIES SORRY WE'RE GONNA SUNSET YOUR SERVICES IN TWO YEARS. SO I THINK. TO THAT UP FRONT I THINK WE'D HAVE TO TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND NON PROPOSITION I NAY TO THESE ARE WITHIN THE GUARANTEED TO CERTAINLY THEY COULDN'T SUPPORT. ON THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS -- BUT WE DO HAVE A A PLAN THAT THE ONLINE COLLEGE HAS HE PLANNED TO SPEND THOSE RESOURCES IN SUPPORT OF STUDENTS TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS -- AND TO SEE THAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR FORGET TO WRITE THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION PROP NINETY IS HALL ALL SWITCHED ANALOGY SO. RIGHT NOW AT A TIME WHEN WE'VE DOUBLED EDUCATION SPENDING FROM FORTY BILLION TO EIGHTY BILLION -- WE HAD THREE MAJOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS GO ON STRIKE. WE HAVE ANOTHER THREATENING TO GO ON STRIKE WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW HOW LAST COUNT ROUGHLY HALF HAVE TO DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. CONCERNED WHY WHY ARE WE SITTING ON THIS MONEY AND HAVING IT IN THE BANK ACCOUNT RATHER THAN. PUTTING IT IN CAL STARS PUTTING ANY CALPERS DOING SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY. ASSIST THESE -- DISTRICTS. SO I THINK -- THE KEY POINT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THIS MONEY UNLESS THERE IS A SHARP SHIFT IN DIRECTION ON THIS COLLEGE IT IS PART OF OUR PROPOSITION NINETY PACKAGE IT'S PART OF THE CAPITAL PLAN. SO -- AND THE MONEY IS SITTING THERE BUT IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WITH LIKE YOU MENTIONED A NUMBER OF EXPENDITURES -- OFTEN TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS DEPENDING ON LEGISLATIVE AND GOVERNOR DIRECTION SO -- YOU KNOW IF IF IF THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO BE RENEGOTIATING SUMS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT WAY IF WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING FORWARD THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. BUT WITH WITH THE PROJECT GOING FORWARD WE DID WANT TO SET ASIDE THIS MONEY IT IS ONE TIME MONEY IT IS FOR START UP COSTS THIS IS A NEW INITIATIVE. SO WE THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO PUT THAT ASIDE AND I BELIEVE I CAN CONFIRM WITH MY COLLEAGUES BUT IT IS PROBABLY EARNING MONEY ATTHE NORMAL BANK DEPOSIT RATE. WHICH IS WHAT. YOU KNOW THE MONIES CAN SPEND YOU AND I'LL CHECK ON THE NEXT PLANE GO TO VEGAS BECAUSE CLEARLY. IT'S I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT WILL CLEARLY IT'S NOT GETTING SPENT. AND AND CLEARLY WHATEVER PLAN IS BEING PUT TOGETHER. REALLY HAS AN AMOUNT TO HASN'T AMOUNTED TO VERY MUCH I THINK THAT'S THE CHALLENGES WHEN. THE THE CHANCELLOR THE NEW CEO'S BUT HOUSE FOR ARTICULATION OF PLANS IT'S NOT BEEN VERY CLEAR -- NOT BEEN VERY CONVINCING SAID WHICH IS WHICH IS WHY WE TOOK IN ASSEMBLY ACTION THIS YEAR. AND GIVEN. THAT ARM WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PRIORITIES WE REALLY WOULD URGE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE A HARDER LOOK AT REALLY WHAT DOES. THIS PROGRAM NEED IN THE NEXT YEAR TO WHICH I THINK MAKES SENSE WHAT REALISTICALLY COULD BE SPENT AND AND FRANKLY THAN THE REST SHOULD BE. REDIRECTED AMONGST. MANY OF ALL OF OUR COLLECTIVE SURE PRIORITIES I THINK WE HAVE MANY SURE PARKS [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. THANK [inaudible] MR MAYES. I WASN'T PREPARED TODAY TO DEFEND ONLINE COLLEGES BUT I I DO FEEL -- THE NEED -- TO TO DEFEND SOME FOLKS THAT THAT LIVE IN IN MY DISTRICT IN A RURAL PART. OF THE STATE YEAH AND A COMMUNITY LIKE THE ONE THAT I GREW UP IN AND STILL LIVE IN. YOU KNOW I WANT TO MY LOCAL COMMITTEE COLLEGE -- FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS -- AND I DROVE TO GET TO MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE I DROVE TWENTY MILES A TO BE ABLE TO GET TO MY MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND I KNOW AS I'M LOOKING AROUND SOME OF THE THE THE OTHER MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE LIVE IN -- INTENSE THAT PARTS OF THE STATE'S WAS SO THERE COMMITTEE COLLEGES ARE DON'T HAVE THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH LOTS OF FACULTY THEY CAN HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT BY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS -- THE DAY -- THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR MY FOR MY SCHOOL DISTRICT -- ARE MY SCHOOL OF MY COMMITTEE CALLS DISTRICT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM IN OUT WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO SAY THISA LUXURY ITEM -- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A LUXURY ITEM -- BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT A FRIENDS THAT I GREW UP WITH THE NETWORK NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO GO ON TO COLLEGE BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GO AWAY BECAUSE THEY HAD. TO A TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND SO I FEAR I JUST FEAR THAT THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY IS HEY WELL YOU KNOW WE WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THIS PROGRAM. ALL TOGETHER. WITH THAT SAID I AM SENSITIVE -- TO THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE IN REGARDS TO HOW ONEY IS BEING SPENT AND IT WOULD SEEM APPROPRIATE -- TO HAVE -- THIS CHANCELLOR OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE SHORT THE CEO WHOEVER IS A TO BE ABLE TO COME -- BUT BEFORE THIS BODY AND SAY WHAT DO YOU DILLON -- AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE NOT SPENDING MONEY AS QUICKLY AS A NEED TO BE SPENDING MONEY THEY HAVEN'T -- SUBMITTED PLANS LIKE THE NEED TO SUBMIT PLANS. IN BACK TO BACK TO MY POINT IS I'VE GOT -- KIDS THAT LIVE IN MY DISTRICT IN MY HOMETOWN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'RE NOT PROVIDING FOR THEM AND THEY NEED TO GET ON WITH IT IF THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY. MR MCCARTY TO FOLLOW UP TO THAT BECAUSE I HAVE MISS SKINNER ON DECK AS WEL FOLLOW UP JUST THIS TOPIC BUT STATE SENATOR IN GOV. IS BEFORE ME. QUIT MUSCULAR. I'M JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THE COMMENTS IS SO THE I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO ONLINE COURSES AND I WANT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE ONLINE COURSES AND I AM CONVINCED. THAT IT ABSOLUTELY IS A NEED BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY YOU'RE ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES STILL OF OUR COMMUNICABLE **** IS ORIENTATION TOWARDS THE FULL TIME STUDENT. WHO IS AVAILABLE YOU NINE FIVE TO GO TO SCHOOL WHEN WE KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE? ARE HAVING TO WORK AND THEN TRY TO FIT THEIR EDUCATION AND AND THAT'S EVEN STUDENTS TO WRITE OFF A HIGH SCHOOL BUT THEN WE ALSO HAVE STUDENTS. THAT NEED TO COME BACK AND WHO ARE WHO ARE IN MIDDLE OF A CAREER CHANGER NEED NEW SKILL SET OR WHATEVER SO I WANT. MORE ONLINE COURSES THE ISSUE AND THE CONTROVERSY LAST YEAR AND I THINK IT'S BEING WELL POINTED OUT AGAIN TODAY IS THAT. WE'RE NOW HAPPY TO SET SOMETHING UP THAT IS GOING TO TAKE YEARS TO REALLY BE OPERATIONAL WHEN THE NEED IS NOW AND WHEN WE HAD DISTRICTS IN COLLEGES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. WHO SHOWED A DESIRE AND A WILLINGNESS TO FULFILL THE NEED AND WHO ARE ALREADY ACCREDITED AND WHO ALREADY HAVE CURRICULUM SO THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DEVELOP CURRICULA? AND THEY ALSO CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPORT FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO TAKE THE CLASS ONLINE BUT MADE THEN NEED THE IN PERSON. SO I ROMANTICALLY THIS COLLEGE NEW DISTRICT IS LOCATED RIGHT BY OWN DISTRICT RIGHT IN OAKLAND -- NOW I DOUBT -- FOR EXAMPLE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES THAT IF THERE ARE SOME STUDENTS IN YOUR AREA WHO DECIDE TO TAKE THE ONLINE COURSES FROM THIS. THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO OAKLAND TO GET THE SUPPORT SO IF. THE IF THE OAKLAND BASED DISTRICT HAS IN MIND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SET UP SATELLITE SPOCK'S AROUND THE STATE TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT AND I DON'T KNOW AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY THE NEED TO SPEND FORTY EIGHT MILLION I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT SEEMS TO ME. A REAL DUPLICATE TO EFFORT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. SO MY ISSUE IS MUCH MORE. HOW DO WE BEST TO LIVE FOR ON? COURSES AND ONLINE TEACHING MOST COST EFFECTIVELY AND MOST EDUCATIONALLY EFFECTIVELY. AND I THE LAKE BEEN THE LAST YEAR'S DISCUSSION WAS EVEN LA -- THAT RAISED THAT THE USE OF EXISTING ACCREDITED. LOCATIONS WHO ALREADY HAVE CURRICULA MAY BE A WISER COURSE. BUT IT WAS OUR THE ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THAT WAS BE RESET ON THIS -- PROPOSAL BUT LASTLY -- JUST POINT OUT AND I WOULD ASK. I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER. THING THAT WE IN PROP NINETY EIGHT THAT WE'VE GUARANTEED FOR SEVEN YEARS. THIS IS THE ONLY PROP NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES THAT I CAN THINK OF THAT WE SAID OKAY YES WE'RE GOING TO SET THIS ASIDE FOR SEVEN YEARS. FINANCIAL LIKE TO SPAWN BEFORE GOING TO THE DIGITAL MEMBERS OR I THINK AT THE SET ASIDE IS TIED UP WITH THE FACT THIS IS A BRAND NEW. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE SAID THAT IS IT IS DIFFERENT BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FOR THAT REASON. MR MCCARTY NOT LINKED IS NOT CALLED THE CAPITAL BUT THAT'S OKAY. HELLO BUT IT'S FOR START UP COSTS YES. YEAH A FEW -- THOUGHTS ON THIS SO WE WE DID SPEND QUITE A BIT TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS. IN JUST TO GET THE CONCLUSION AFTER THIS DISCUSSION WE HAD STUDENTS IN THE AUDIENCE WERE TALKING ABOUT. BEING HUNGRY. AND VETERANS ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS RESOURCE CENTERS APPS BOOKS ADVOCATING. FOR THE THE POINT A PROGRAM IN THE EMOJI PROGRAM AND SO WE JUST THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ARE OTHER NEEDS TODAY. IT DOESN'T MEAN THIS PROGRAM SHOULD GET THE DEATH PENALTY SO LET'S LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK THE WHOLE PROGRAM SO. YEAH THERE THERE IS A BIG NEED -- TO EDUCATE -- CALLED ADULTS WHO DON'T HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION OR EVEN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA BECAUSE HE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW ACQUIRE DOING ONLINE PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW -- WE HOPE NOT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S AN ARRANGEMENT THIS SHOULD BE STUFF IT'S DIFFERENT WE'RE NOT GOING. TO COMPETE BUT THE BIG PICTURE IS -- THESE PROGRAMS ARE GONNA GET APPORTIONMENT WHICH YOU KNOW EQUIVALENT OF EIGHTY EIGHT SO THEY'RE GONNA GET MONEY PER STUDENT PER SLOT AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER PER SEAT. SO DO THEY NEED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. BECAUSE IS A HUNDRED ONE TIME. THERE'S TWENTY ON GOING AND TWENTY ON GOING AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY SO HUNDRED MILLION AND THEY'VE SPENT NOT ONE MILLION. SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM CAN EXIST. BUT DO THEY NEED THIS SLUSH FUND RIGHT NOW WHEN WE CAN REEVALUATE IT EVERY YEAR. IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT THERE ARE -- GOING TO UTILIZE THIS ANYTIME -- TODAY TOMORROW OR IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND OUR PRIORITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS TODAY I KNOW -- MISTREATING TALKED ABOUT SOME ISSUES ARE DISTRICTS SISTERS A PURSE BUT OUR PLAN TALKED ABOUT -- INC IN INCREASING FUNDING FOR VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS ON GOING IN ONE TIME. PART TIME FACULTY HOURS FOR TOO MANY CALLS TO HELP STUDENTS. UP FULL TIME FACULTY. HUNGER FREE CAMPUSES TO MAKE SURE WE DEALING WITH OUR STUDENTS. BASIC NEEDS ISSUES -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW THOSE ARE REAL PRIORITIES FOR FOR OUR TWO MILLION COMMUNITY COLLEGES TODAY. AND SO THIS IS JUST ABOUT PRIORITIES AND SELL I DON'T BELIEVE THIS NOTION THAT BY DOING THIS IT'S SAD DEATH PENALTY FOR THE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA GET APPORTIONMENT AS IT'S BEING ROLLED OUT THIS IS A BUSINESS MAYBE THEY NEED A LITTLE START UP MONEY. BUT I THINK WE TOOK A GAS LAST YEAR ON THE START UP AND WE OVER APPROPRIATED WILDLY AND I THINK THIS IS. A KIND OF A MID COURSE CORRECTION SO. THANKS THANK YOU MISTER KING. THINK ABOUT TURN THAT'S ONE OF THE CLEAR. FIVE MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM SPRINGS IS COMMENTS CLIPPING. WE ARE ALL VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ONLINE EDUCATION FOR COMMUNICABLE CHOSE. SO WHAT HAPPENED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO -- WE WORK WITH GOVERNOR BROWN WORKED WITH PREVIOUS CHANCELLOR AND WE ASKED. ALL THE DIFFERENT CAN UNICOM JUST UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO START DOING ONLINE PROGRAM. WHICH HAS BEEN VERY EXCITING TO WATCH BECAUSE HE WAS A MORE EFFICIENT WAY -- THE ONE THING THAT WE LOVE I KNOW UNIVERSALLY AS LEGISLATORS WE ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES EVERY SINGLE EVERY SINGLE ONE FROM THE DO AMAZING THINGS EVERY DAY WITH. ALL TESTING POPULATIONS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SCHOOL OR CHANGING CAREERS AND SO WE WE WERE ALL VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ONLINE ON ONLINE PROGRAMMING AT THE COMMUNICABLE JUST TO GET STUDENTS THROUGH FASTER. WHAT THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT? IT WAS A PROPOSAL TO CREATE A ENTIRELY NEW OPERATION. ARE AN ENTIRELY NEW ONLINE CAMPUS. OUR FEA WAS THAT IT WOULD COMPETE WITH EACH OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEIR ON LINE PROGRAMS AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T. COMPLETELY DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY WON'T DO THAT THEY SAY THEY WANT TO THAT BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN TOTALLY PROVEN -- WE ARE THE CONCERN IS A SENSE OF MIXED MESSAGE BECAUSE WE TOLD. OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM GO DO ONLINE. GOOGLE DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE COLLEGE DID AND AND START GETTING RESULTS IN AND THEY'RE DOING THAT SO SO. IT SENDS A REAL MIXED MESSAGES TO SAY HEY YOU BEEN SUCCESSFUL. SO INSTEAD OF GIVING YOU MORE MONEY WE'RE GOING TO PUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER HERE FIFTH AND LET IT SIT THERE AND GOOD LUCK WITH. YOUR STUFF BUT THIS IS JUST GOING TO KIND OF SIT THERE SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WERE. WE'RE WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH SO WE ARE COMPLETELY -- PROUD I THINK OF ALL THE DIFFERENT WORK THAT ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE DOING UP AND DOWN STATE ESPECIALLY IN THE ONLINE THERE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE. THIS PROPOSAL IS A COMPLETELY NEW. PROGRAM -- AS I THINK ALL THE COLLEAGUES HAVE SORT OF TALKED ABOUT THAT WE HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH LAST YEAR. AND WE CONTINUE CONCERNED HOW TO CASF CONCERNS WITH THIS YEAR AND I THINK WE WE WANT TO GIVE THE NEW CHANCE A CHANCE -- FOR CLEAN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL. HAVING SAID THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS EVEN UNDER OUR ASSEMBLY PREPARATION WHICH AGAIN IS FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING MORE. THAN ENOUGH MONEY OVER EVEN THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO REALLY DO SOMETHING. VERY INTERESTING AND AGAIN GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO BE BUSINESS FROM THE OTHER COMMITTEE COLLEGE PARTIES. AND AGAIN ALSO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO KEEP MOVING ONLINE SO THAT THAT REALLY WAS THE IDEA BEHIND THE THICK [inaudible] DOCTOR WEBER [inaudible] YES CLUB. AS I LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATION AT YOU KNOW I I'VE FIRST BEING VERY HONEST I'VE NEVER BEEN FAVOR THIS PROPOSAL. ONLINE COLLEGE I I THINK IT'S A WASTE OF RESOURCES AND I DON'T AND BEING AN EDUCATOR I DON'T THINK IS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO REALLY BE ENGAGED IN. ONLINE EDUCATION -- BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE IT REQUIRES A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY TO DO ONLINE INSTRUCTION AND TO DO IT WELL OKAY. SO -- AND GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY AS WELL AS THE THE BROAD. SWEEP OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA ALL OVER THE STATE AND AND AND AND I'VE I'VE BEEN A PART OF AND SEEN A LOT OF THE ONLINE INSTRUCTION. I MEAN IT'S AN AMAZING THING AND AND THE FACT THAT THEY CAN WE CAN DO WHAT WE CAN DELIVER ALMOST ANY CURRICULUM THAT WE WANT. ACROSS THE STATE TO SET UP A WHOLE COLLEGE IT DOES NOTHING BUT ONLINE INSTRUCTION. I THINK LIMITS WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF ONLINE INSTRUCTION BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE AN AMAZING INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID -- YOU KNOW AYE AYES I STILL GET THE SENSE THAT THAT THE THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY ARE. ARE ARE BASICALLY HIT HESITANT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL OF OF ONLINE INSTRUCTION WHICH I THINK IS IS THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU TRYING TO DEVELOP A NEW ENTITY. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A COLLEGE WHEN WE DECIDE WE'RE GONNA DO YOU SEE YOU SEE MERCED A WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DO IT WE SET ASIDE WHICH IS TRUE. A CHUNK OF MONEY TO HANDLE IT SO WE'RE GOING TO REALLY DO A COLLEGE YOU HAVE TO SET ASIDE A CHUNK OF MONEY BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE PLANNING CAN'T WAIT EVERY YEAR FOR AN ALLOCATION BECAUSE THAT HINDERS. THE THE NEW PROJECTS ARE YOU IF YOU GO TO A NEW COLLEGE OR NEW WHAT WE'VE DONE NEW COLLEGES IN AT THE UNIVERSITY -- WE HAVE TO SET ASIDE MONEY IT'S SOMETIMES PAINFUL TO DO BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE INVESTMENT HAS TO BE TO IT TO TRY TO RECRUIT. FACULTY AND AND AND BY HARDWARE AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MONEY THIS SET ASIDE SO. IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT. IT'S ALSO AS I LISTEN TO US TALK SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS BECAUSE AT SOME POINT IT SAYS TO PEOPLE WE GIVE YOU MONEY BETTER SPENT RIGHT AWAY EVEN IF YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON SPENT. BECAUSE IF NOT WE WILL COME BACK AND GET T AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS A PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEN THEY DON'T ALLOW YOU ROLL MONEY OVER THEY JUMP UP IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS IT START BY AND ALL KIND OF SUFF THE TITLE ONE AND STUFF THEY MAY NEVER USED IS. STORED SOMEWHERE AND MAYBE IT'S YOU KNOW GET EATEN BY RATS OR WHATEVER BUT THE BUT THEY USE THE MONEY BECAUSE THAT THEY DON'T THERE'S A DISTRICT WE COME BACK AND SAY ALL WE CAN TAKE THAT BACK FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T USE IT. SO EVERYBODY GOT SMART STAR USES STEPH SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WE START TELLING PEOPLE YOU ONLY SPEND A LITTLE BIT SO WE DON'T TAKE IT FROM YOU. SO THEREFORE THE NEXT GROUP THAT COMES ALONG THE WORD IS CLEAR SPEND YOUR STUFF EVEN IF YOU DON'T NEED. TO SO. I'M IN A WEIRD POSITION WITH REGARD TO THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT AN ADVOCATE OF THIS AT ALL -- AND I WOULD PROBABLY TAKE ALL THE MONEY AND SAY WELL THIS KIND OF AS A SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR LOSS AND MOVE ON AW AND IF THAT'S WHAT WE WILL DO WE NEED TO DO IT. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT BEFORE THEY GET TO THE FORTY THREE MILLION THAT YOU TALKING ABOUT -- THEN WE NEED TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO IT BUT I'M NOT HEART WISE I'M EITHER BEING YOUR BILL I'M WITH YOU YOU KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BECAUSE I'M NOT INTO THIS BECAUSE I THINK. THE AND I TOLD I TOLD THE LAST GOVERNOR THAT THAT WHAT HE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH COULD EASILY BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER IT'S SYSTEM. WOULD MORE RESOURCE IS GOING TO A COMMUNICABLE IS THIS ALREADY HAS AN AFFRONT NOMINAL ONLINE EXPERIENCE AND TARGETING THOSE THINGS AND THEN WITH THOSE YOU CAN YOU KNOW THEY CAN HOOK UP ANYWHERE YOU WANT. AS WELL AS MANY BY SEE ISSUES DOMINGUEZ HILLS AS THE GREATEST KIND OF THING WE ARE DO A WHOLE A WHOLE LIBRARY DEGREE IN A IS ONLINE RIGHT NOW FOR THE WHOLE STATE -- A GUN TO EPPING SAN JOSE AND UP AND THEY GET TOGETHER MAYBE EVERY THREE OR FOUR MONTHS OR WHATEVER FOR ONE EXPERIENCE WITH THE WHOLE -- DEGREE AND AND LIBRARY SCIENCES ONLINE BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEED. FOR ONE PROGRAM IN ONE SECTION SO ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT IF WE DON'T DO IT WE NEED TO DO IT GIVEN THE HUNDRED TWENTY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL ME IF THEY REALLY WANT TO PLAN ABOUT. OUR CHANCES SHOULD COME HERE AND TELL US WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH THE MONEY THOUGH COULD YOU JUST DON'T GIVE A PERSON  HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MILLION DOLLARS AND SAY GOAL GO FORTH AND BE GOOD -- THEY NEED TO TELL WHAT THEY WILL DO BUT OTHERWISE IF WE WE START TAKING A PROBLEM TELL YOU THE WORD TO GET AROUND REAL QUICK IN THE STATE. THAT IF THE IF THEY GIVE YOU SOME MONEY. YOU BETTER USE IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE I'LL COME BACK AND TAKE IT FROM ME. EXACTLY. SO. IF I JUST MIGHT ADD I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WHAT'S BEEN ARTICULATED BY ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES -- BUT BUT BUT I CLEARLY RECALL OUR EXPERIENCE LAST YEAR AND ONE CHALLENGE WAS -- THE CONCEPT WAS IT -- COMPLETELY THAT IT IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL -- WE WERE TOLD ONE THING WE WERE TOLD THAT THE WITH GOING TO OFFER CERTIFICATES AND A. A.'S THAT DIDN'T CHANGE WIN THE CHANCE OF THEN CAME BACK BEFORE US.% AND SO IT WAS CLEAR TO US THAT IT WAS A MOVING TARGET. I CONTRADICT THAT TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THIS YEAR WERE HE'S GOT PLANNING DOLLARS TO LOOK AT THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW C. ISSUE. IN STOCKTON. SO WHAT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SET MUCH BETTER WITH ALL OF US LAST YEAR. IS IF YOU'D COME FOR IT WITH THE CONCEPT AND ASK FOR PLANNING DOLLARS RESOURCES -- THEN WE COULD. COME BACK THIS YEAR LOOK AT A PLAN AND BE BETTER POLLS -- TO SUPPORT YOU IN YOUR QUEST TO FULLY FUND WHATEVER THE TIME IT WAS. JUST SEEMS -- IT DOESN'T SEEM TO FOLLOW EIGHT EIGHT CONSISTENT OUT LINE OF THOUGHT THAT FOR ONE INSTITUTION REQUIRES PLANNING AND INVESTMENT. AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT FOR PLANNING TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ITS VALUE. VERSUS AN IDEA THAT THAT THAT CHANGED MIDSTREAM IN TERMS OF WHAT. THE ULTIMATE. GOAL WOULD BE FIRST WE WERE TOLD. A A THE CERTIFICATE THAT WE WERE TOLD NO -- AS I RECALL S. CI YOU CAME IN SUPPORT ME AND WE WERE CLEAR THAT WAS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE KIND OF ELEVATED THEIR CURRENT POSITION SO SEAD YOU TALKED ABOUT OF WE HAVE YOU KNOW -- CLERK TYPIST. TO AND THEN YOU WANT TO BE A CLERK TYPIST WNDER IF YOU COULD TAKE THIS TRAINING ONLINE AND MOVE UP. AND SO I THINK THAT'S ALSO WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING REMEMBER LAST YEAR IT APPEARED TO BE A MOVING TARGET AND NOW WE'RE HEARING. THAT YOU SPENT ONE TENTH OF THE DOLLARS ALLOCATED. IN A CLIMATE IN WHICH WE HAVE MORE IN THE THE WE HAVE RESOURCES I THINK THAT. THE ONE PIECE THAT WOULD ADD TO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SHARED ON AND I THINK IT'S REFLECTED -- IN BOTH THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE ASSEMBLY AND THE QUESTIONS MY SENATE SUB ONE SURE ASK IN TERMS OF WILL YOU INDEED BE CRIPPLED BY HAVING THE BUDGET CUT AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT YEAR. IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. MR OBERNOLTE. ALL WAY AND QUICKLY MADAM CHAIRMAN. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER HERE. IF YOU FAST FORWARD A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW. I THINK NO ONE WOULD DISPUTE THE FACT THAT MOST EDUCATION WILL BE ONLINE. IN A WITH PERIODIC VISITS TO AN IN PERSON FACILITY. AND HOW WE GET FROM HERE TO THERE IS THE QUESTION NOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S BEST ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL. COMMUNITY OLLEGE SYSTEM OR IF IF IT REQUIRES A NEW ONLINE INSTITUTION I'VE GOT TO RECENT EXPERIENCE ON THIS LAST YEAR I WENT BACK TO GRADUATE SCHOOL OBVIOUSLY I DID IT. THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAM BECAUSE I GOT TO BE IN SACRAMENTO EVERY DAY. BUT I DO REALLY GAVE ME AN APPRECIATION. FOR HOW COMPLICATED IT IS TO DO ONLINE EDUCATION WHILE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN JUST THROW TOGETHER ON A WEBSITE AND EXPECT PEOPLE TO LEARN IN A WAY THAT SUPERIOR TO DOING IT IN PERSON SO -- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE LONG TERM HERE FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A AN EASY LEFT. TO GET THIS PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING AND AND I'V I'M OF THE OPINION THAT WE OUGHT TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. TO TO DO THE JOB THAT WE'VE GIVEN THEM EVEN IF IT'S TAKING A LITTLE LONGER TO ROLL OUT THAN WE EXPECTED. TO TO AND THE SENATOR OFF. YOU KNOW I GUESS I HELP START THIS DISCUSSION SO. I PROBABLY SHOULD TRY TO FINISH THE TERM. I HAD SOME RESERVATIONS -- MINE THIS PROPOSAL WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO WAS SO I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT -- CREATING A NEW ENTITY HIRING A NEW PRESIDENT AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF IT EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENTS AND CREATING A BRIDGE BUREAUCRACY WITHOUT -- REALLY. HITTING THE MARK ON OF THE FIRST MARK ON THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT ARE SET OUT BUT I WAS CONVINCED THAT -- REALLY IN ORDER TO GET SOME DECENT METRICS. INSTEAD OF SPREADING A LITTLE BROTHER LIMITED. EARLY SPEAKING LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY OVER. BUT ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN OR SO COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WE WE REALLY OUT OF FOCUS THIS EFFORT AND ONE SO WE COULD SET SOME GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND OBTAIN SOME MEASUREMENTS -- I THINK THE DIFFICULTY THAT I HAVE AND OF COURSE WE DIDN'T TAKE UP WE DIDN'T HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THIS SO WE DON'T HAVE A HEARING ON IT I THINK ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT I HAVE. IS UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF TAKING FIFTY MILLION AWAY FROM ONE HUNDRED MILLION WE'VE HEARD THAT THE A OF THE BOARD APPARENTLY IS APPROVED A FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WHICH I ASSUME IS FOR THIS NEXT BUDGET YEAR -- AND I I GUESS I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GET THE INFORMATION. IN LEARNING WHAT THAT WHAT THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR. IS LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT DO THEY IN FACT NEED THAT IN ORDER TO GET GOING WHERE THEY NEED TO BE GOING BECAUSE HAVING I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVING APPROVED THIS THING. WHETHER WITHOUT RESERVATIONS WE OUGHT TO GIVE IT AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO WHY THIS SUCCEED OR FAIL GIVE IT ENOUGH TIME SO WE CAN SEE WHAT THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE. AND SEE WHAT THE MEASUREMENTS ARE AND WHETHER IN FACT HITS THE MARK OR DOESN'T HIT THE MARK AND IF IT DOESN'T WE NEED TO GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE AND FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY. TO TO CREATE AN ONLINE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASSEMBLY THAT'S THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF THE BOW WAVE. IN TERMS OF EDUCATING. AND MEETING DEMAND FOR STUDENTS AND SEES. IN IN BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES SO. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT -- MANAGER I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GET THE INFORMATION BUT WILL HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT BEFORE WE HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH OUR COLLECTION THE ASSEMBLY. AND THAT WE WILL WITH THAT LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY TWO VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS. HELLO. THE FOR THE THERE IS NO GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON THIS ISSUE -- BOTH THE SENATE ANDASSEMBLY ADDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT TOOK DIFFERENT APPROACHES. AS FOR THE SENATE -- PROVIDED FIFTEEN MILLION IN ONE TIME -- TO EXPAND OR CREATE NEW VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS. OF THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED TEN MILLION ONGOING PROBLEM THE GENERAL FUND -- FOR VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS SYSTEM WIDE. AND PROVIDED SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION ONE TIME FOR FOR SPECIFIC. VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS IN SPECIFIC COLLEGES. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT A COUPLE BIG THINGS FOR YOU TO AS YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS ISSUE ONE IS THE CURRENT ONGOING -- FUNDING FOR THE VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER IS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO TAKING THE ASSEMBLY ACTION WOULD -- SINCE THE TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF ONGOING FUNDING THAT THE PROGRAM IS RECEIVING. AND SECOND -- WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO EXPAND OR CREATE NEW VETERANS OR CENTERS OVER THE LAST. TWO YEARS -- NINE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FIFTY NINE OUT OF THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES RECEIVED AWARDS. AND WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS -- FOUR POINT NINE MILLION THAT REMAINS UNSPENT SO IT HAS YOUR DELIVERY AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT AN AMOUNT YOU WANT TO PROVIDE IT TO STICK TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS SOME FUNDING THAT CURRENTLY HAS. HAS BEEN AND SPEND YOU CAN ALSO -- TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF DECIDING HOW MANY STE SENATE CENTERS YOU LIKE TO OPERATE. YOU LIKE TO FUND. FINANCE WE'LL SAY VERY BRIEFLY -- WE BELIEVE THAT TO ME COLLEGES CIRCUS CAN ALREADY USE THEIR ON GOING ALLOCATION FROM THIS IN EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM SO WITHIN PROPOSITION -- NINETY EIGHT WITH WHERE THEY CAN RELY ON THAT FUNDING RATHER THAN PUTTING A NEW FUNDING WITHIN THE GUARANTEED. ACTIONS MR MCCARTY YEAH I JUST REAL BRIEFLY TALKED ABOUT THAT EARLIER FOR AWHILE BUT BUDGETS ARE ABOUT CHOICES AND LITERALLY THE TEN MILLION THAT WE THAT WE CUT FROM THE ONLINE. IS RIGHT HERE FOR THE VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS THANK YOU THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR ROBB. I GUESS THIS IS FOR FINANCE ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT I RECEIVED FROM THE FIELD AS WE USED TO SAY IN THE MILITARY. IS THAT AS THIS MONEY THAT SPRINT PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED FOR VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS. MOVES THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHAU CHANCES OFFICE DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES -- IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE EARMARKED AND IF IT IS THE YEAR MARKETS IGNORED AND IN SOME CASES AT LEAST. THE MONEY DISAPPEARS INTO THE GENERAL FUND OF THE PARTICULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE INVOLVED. CAN ONLY IF THE VETERANS RESOURCE -- EMPLOYEE KNOWS THAT THE MONEY IS HEADING THERE-- AT LEAST IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE I WAS THE MONEY. OF FENCED IN HOLD BACK INTO THE VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER -- THAT'S ANECDOTAL INFORMATION I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU DID A SURVEY WITH THE SURVEY RESULTS WOULD BE BUT MY POINT IS I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO IF WE APPROPRIATE MONEY HERE IN THE GOVERNOR AGREES BY SIGNING THE BUDGET. FOR VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE AND THAT THE MONEY ACTUALLY FINDS ITS WAY INTO. A VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS AT THE INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES INVOLVED NO CRITICISM OF THE CHANCES OFFICE OF SOMETIMES THINGS JUST HAPPEN BUT I I DO THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR PROCESS -- HERE IF IN FACT THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO ME YEAH HAS ANY DEGREE OF ACCURACY. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK THE QUESTIONS. OKAY SEEN THAT LOOK ROOM ON TO ISSUE TWENTY THREE STUDENT HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS ELIO. THIS IS THE MAIN REVISION INCLUDED PROPOSALS THAT ADDRESS STUDENT FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY AT UC AND CSU BUT BUT TAP NOTHING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED THE YOU SEE IF YOU MAY REVISION PROPOSALS BUT THEN ADDED ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE TO ADDRESS FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON THE THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE TO NOT THAT DIFFERENT THEY'RE JUST SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT APPROACHES. SO -- RELATED -- TO FOOD SECURITY THE SENATE PROVIDED FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME OF WHICH FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS TO CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF COLLEGE BASED FOOD PROGRAMS. THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME THE DIFFERENCES HERE NOT TOO DIFFERENT. HOUSING AND SECURITY -- THE SENATE PROVIDED NINE MILLION AND HOUSING AND SECURE STUDENTS AND THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED TEN MILLION ONE TIME FOR A RAPID RE HOUSING PILOT PROGRAM. IT'S ON THE HOUSING ISSUE THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT IS ONE THERE'S THE DIFFERENCE OF ONE TIME VERSES ON GOING. ON THE OTHER ISSUE THAT OPEN A IS THAT THE THE THE LANGUAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSAL'S IS DIFFERENT A LITTLE BIT IN THAT THE SENATE LANGUAGE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE -- BROUGHT IN PROVIDES MORE FLEXIBILITY TO COLLEGES AND AND CAMPUS IS BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IS THE SAME FOR YOU SEE IF YOU -- IN TERMS OF HOW THOSE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT WHERE THE ASSEMBLY APPROACH IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE. PRESCRIPTIVE IN TERMS OF EXACTLY -- WHAT'S EXPECTED WITH UP WITH THOSE FUNDS. UNDER THE L. L. HAVE A PREFERENCE I WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC DATE IS JUST MORE OF IT I GOT YOU ON OUT OF TARGETED PROGRAMMERS FLEXIBILITY. GOT IT. UP FINANCE AS EARLIER NOTED -- IN THE NAY REVISION THE GOVERNOR PROPOSE A PROPOSED ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR UC AND CSU FOR RAPID RE HOUSING SO WHILE IT'S NOT GOURMET REVISION WE ARE OPEN TO LOOKING FOR MONEY WITHIN THE GUARANTEE TO FIND. THAT LEVEL OF RESOURCES FOR SOME RESOURCES FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL AND FOR THE OTHER ITEMS THAT HOW I MENTIONED **** WITH -- WE WERE MATCHING IT'S JUST A MATTER OF BALANCE WITHIN THE GUARANTEE WHAT WE CAN. FOR THANK YOU QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ITEM TWENTY FOUR FACULTY. ISSUE TWENTY FOUR FACULTY. SO THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THE GOVERNOR HAD NO SPECIFIC PROPOSAL BUT THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BOTH MADE AUGMENTATIONS SO THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT FACULTY PROGRAMS HERE THAT THAT ARE -- BEFORE YOU FIRST IS THE FULL TIME FACULTY PROGRAM AND THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS JUST CREATED LAST YEAR. THE FUNDING PROVIDED TO THE PROGRAM RECEIVE FIFTY MILLION ONGOING LAST YEAR -- MUST BE USED TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF INSTRUCTION -- ALCHEMY BECAUSE THAT IS THAT IF TALK BY FULL TIME. FULL TIME FACULTY BUT THE SENATE PROVIDED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOR THE PROGRAM. THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED FOR ME FORTY MILLION DOLLARS -- SO AGAIN JUST WITH A DIFFERENCE IN AND AND NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING THERE. THE ASSEMBLY DID ALSO -- HABITABLE LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES COLLEGES TO USE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY BEST PRACTICES WHEN HIRING A NEW FULL TIME FACULTY. SO THAT IS ANOTHER DIFFERENCE -- THE OTHER -- THE OTHER PROGRAM IS PART TIME FACULTY OFFICE HOURS WHICH IS A CAT ONE STANDING CATEGORICAL ON IT THE COMMUTE COLLEGES HAVE. E. S. SENATE PROVIDED AT THREE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR COLA TO THE PROGRAM WHAT THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES US SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING. I'M JUST ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND FOR THAT PROGRAM BUT THE PROGRAM THAT LAST YEAR RECEIVE TWELVE MILLION ONGOING AND THERE WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME APPROPRIATION. I MEAN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION YET AND THROUGH THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR IS NOT HERE YET ON IT BUT WE WE WOULD EXPECT THAT SOME OF THAT FUNDING WOULD REMAIN AVAILABLE. SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS YOU'RE DECIDING HOW MUCH FUNDING. TO TO ALLOCATE TO THE PERSON FACULTY PROGRAM. FINANCE SAID THESE ITEMS ARE NOT GENERALLY IN OUR PROPOSITION NINETY PACKAGE I WILL POINT OUT THOUGH THAT SELL OIL MENTIONED THERE WAS A FIFTY MILLION ONGOING APPROPRIATION FROM LAST YEAR AND THAT IS MAINTAINED IN OUR BUDGET. AND CHRIS ONE TO MAKE ONE OTHER POINT YEAH AND I ALSO KNOW BECAUSE OF THE 50% RULE -- ALL OF THE INCREASES ON THE APPORTIONMENT SIDE YOU HAVE A GOING TOWARDS -- INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND FACULTY SALARIES AS WELL. FACULTY PURPOSES NOT SALARIES. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU FIFTY TWENTY FIVE OF A VARIETY OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE ADJUSTMENTS. MISTER WILLIAM ALL WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE THE THE KEY AREAS THROUGH THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT -- HERE WHERE THERE IS LIKE A PROPOSAL FOR THE GOVERNOR BUT THEN THERE ARE MANY OTHER DECISIONS IN THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY SO. THE GOVERNOR PROVIDED -- TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO SUPPORT -- IMMIGRANT. IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES -- THIS FOR FOR STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES AT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES THIS IS A FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDE THOSE EIGHTEEN NINETY IN NINETEEN NINETY WE PROVIDED. TEN MILLION ONE TIMES THIS WOULD TAKE THAT ONE TIME FUNDING AND MAKE ONGOING. THE SENATE -- THE SENATE ACTION WAS. TO REJECT THE PROPOSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND THE ASSEMBLY -- ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE NEXT AREA IS THE WHAT'S CALLED THE FUND FOR STUDENT SUCCESS WHICH IS ACTUALLY CONSISTS OF FOUR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS -- THE THE GOVERNOR HAD NO PROPOSAL THE SENATE PROVIDED THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO ALL FOR PROGRAMS THAT WAS FOR A COST OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE ASSEMBLY -- PROVIDED AUGMENTATIONS TO TWO OUT OF THE FOUR PROGRAMS THE POINT THE PROGRAM AND DO MUCH OF PROGRAM. THE THE SENATE ALSO PROVIDES -- EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO INCREASE ADMINISTRATION OF THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TRANSFER PROGRAM TO INCREASE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ONLY IN WITHIN A PROPOSAL NOT IN THE OTHERS. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER -- ACTIONS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE ASSEMBLY PLAN THE ASSEMBLY -- PROVIDED FOR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR DREAM RESOURCE CENTERS AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR A CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER POVERTY COLLEGE. IN ADDITION THE ASSEMBLY ALSO -- ADDED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO EXIT EXAM -- THE FOR MAKING CENTER AT THE SAN FRANCISCO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT FROM THE FIELD ACT WHICH IS THE FROM SCHOOL BUILDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT THIS IS A A FEDERALLY OWNED FACILITY -- IN ON UNDER CURRENT LAW -- THAT WOULD HAVE. TO RIGHT HERE TO FILL BACK FROM THE THE PROPOSES TO EXEMPT THAT -- THE WHAT WE DO HAVE OUR ON ONE PROPOSAL AND LEGAL SERVICES HERE WE RECOMMEND THE SENATE. THIS IS A PROGRAM THE LEGAL SERVICES ON RECEIVE TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME LAST YEAR FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THAT THE PROGRAM BEING ADMINISTERED BY DSS AS PART OF ITS LARGER IMMIGRATION SERVICES FUNDING PROGRAM. WHERE THEY CONTRACT WITH NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SST INDICATED THAT NONE OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING HAVE BEEN PROVIDED PART SORRY? ANOTHER ONE COMPANY HAD BEEN SPENT IN IN -- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO WE THINK THAT THAT FUNDING CAN BE REPURPOSED TO COVER THE NINETEEN TWENTY COSTS IF THERE IS AN INTERESTING FUNDING THE PROGRAM ONE TIME AND THAT COULD BE PROVIDED IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE FINANCE. I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THAT LAST POINT REGARDING THE TEN MILLION FUNDING SO WE BELIEVE -- BUT CONVERSATIONS WITH DSS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT SPENDING. OF THAT MONEY WILL BE SPENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND SO WE BELIEVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE BUDGET FOR IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES WE'VE ALREADY REACHED OUT TO US SENATE STAFF ON THIS AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS. ANY CONCERNS IN THE UPCOMING WEEK [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CETERA WHAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT TEN MILLION HASN'T BEEN SPENT THAT WAS APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR DO YOU BELIEVE THE NEED TO BE TWENTY MILLION ASSURES THAT WHAT I UNDERSTAND. SO I BELIEVE THAT WAS AT TEN MILLION ONE TIME APPROPRIATION AND THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING APPROPRIATIONS. THAT'S CORRECT SO IT WAS TEN MILLION ONE TIME THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND WE'RE PROPOSING TEN MILLION ONGOING I THINK. FOR WHAT WE'RE SIGNALLING IS WE WILL HAVE A CONTINUE DISCUSSION WITH THE STAFF. I MEAN IF THERE'S A DO WE KNOW WHAT THE NEED IS. I THINK IT I THANK YOU THAT'S THE HARDSHIP THAT DSS HAS PUT FORWARD I THE WE KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE IN THE SYSTEM WE KNOW THE TYPE OF SERVICES THAT THEY WILL LIKELY NEED -- BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY AT THIS TIME TO KNOW HOW MANY WILL AVAIL THEM THEMSELVES OF THIS SERVICE. AND WHETHER THAT WILL RAMP UP OVER TIME BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW THERE'S A NEED FOR APROPOS OF OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER TO BANK MONEY HERE TO APPROPRIATED AS NEEDED. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE'S TEN MILLION DOLLARS SITTING THERE WE COULD USE A TEN MILLION DOLLARS IT HAS NOT BEEN. COMMITTED RIGHT HANDED TO THE EXTENT WE ALL WANT TO TAKE CARE OF IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THEN THE NEED EXCEEDS TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS DURING THE BUDGET YOU'RE THE I ASSUME THAT CAN BE A BUDGET ADJUSTMENT CORRECT. SO IT IS WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SO THERE IS A TRADEOFF. YES SIR I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS. YEAH YEAH IT'S SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION OF WHAT'S INCLUDED WITHIN THE GUARANTEE BUT YES YOU ARE CORRECT OKAY. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD THANK MANAGER THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER OBERNOLTE. THIS IS WHY THE TOPIC OF LAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE ADJUSTMENTS I'D LIKE TO RAISE AN ISSUE THAT I THINK NEEDS ATENTION AND THIS IS REGARDING SOMETHING THAT. APPLE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE GREED ON THE START OF THIS YEAR WHICH WAS THE EXTENSION OF THE CALIFORNIA -- COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM TO THE SECOND FOR YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I VERY MUCH SUPPORT. HOWEVER NONE OF THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN MY DISTRICT WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY WORDED. THE END OF THAT IS BECAUSE THAT FUNDING HIM FOR THE FIRST YEAR AMENDED ITS AND FAIRNESS THIS IS A A PROBLEM WITH -- THE PROGRAM LAST YEAR. THAT REQUIRES COMMUNITY COLLEGES% TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM. AS A CONDITION FOR GETTING THAT FUNDING AND THE REASON WHY MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAMPER DISSIPATE IN THAT FUNDING IN THAT PROGRAM IS THAT. IF YOU PARTICIPATE IN YOUR DEFAULT RATE ON THOSE STUDENT LOANS IS TOO HIGH THEN YOU LOSE YOUR PELL GRANTS AND MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR PROGRAMS. AND SO NONE OF THEM CAN PARTICIPATE AS AND THERE ARE. A BUNCH OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND IS EXACTLY THIS SAME OPPOSITION MOST OF THEM IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S EQUITABLE SO I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR ALL I REALLY THINK. THAT WHEN WE WRITE THAT THAT INTO THE BUDGET I WOULD REQUEST THAT WE WE GET RID OF THAT STRING BEING ATTACHED TO IT BECAUSE I WOULD BE REALLY NICE IF MY CONSTITUENTS GOT FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TO SO JUST WANTED RAISE THAT POINT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] DIRECTOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL MOVE ON LOCAL. WE ARE [inaudible] ORAL HISTORIES. AT TWO TWENTY SIX IT'S REQUIRED DISCUSSION [inaudible] LET'S SEE. CURRY STARTING IN ISSUE TWENTY SIX RECENT CONCENTRA SLUDGE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE ISSUE BEFORE USING ASSEMBLY ACTION TO PROVIDE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR AN ORAL HISTORY OF THE LEGISLATIVE CAUCUSES. THE FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE ORAL HISTORIES PROGRAM -- WHICH IS A DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY IN THE STATE ARE CONVINCED. ON THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY IS RECEIVING A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ON GOING. THANK YOU -- SO WE DIDN'T PROPOSE THIS AUGMENTATION THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEE NONE WILL MOVE ON MOVING ON TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. LA ALSO PROVIDE US WITH AN OVERVIEW. ON THEIR FINANCIAL AID ISSUES THAT'S RIGHT MADAM CHAIR POSTING HOUSING WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE. YOU HAVE A HAND DOWN YOUR BINDER THAT SUMMARIZES SPENDING LEVELS IN MAJOR COMMONALITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOUSES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AS WELL AS THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. OUT COVERS THE REST OF THE HIGHER ED AGENDA. ITEMS. PAGE ONE SHOWS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ON GOING AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT THAT THE GOVERNOR SENATE AND ASSEMBLY EACH PROVIDE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TO GIVE YOU THAT THE BIG PICTURE IF YOU WILL. THE TOTALS LINE TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE SHOWS THAT BOTH HOUSES APPROVED HIGHER LEVELS OF SPENDING THEN THE GOVERNOR APPROXIMATELY TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. FOR EACH HOUSE VERSES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AMOUNT OF TEN POINT. TWO BILLION DOLLARS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN TEN POINT. TWO OVERALL THE ASSEMBLY SPENDS FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE SENATE -- SO THEY'RE NOT THAT FAR APART REALLY IN TERMS OF DOLLARS. THE BOTTOM LINE BOTTOM TWO LINES OF THE TABLE SHOWSOF THE SENATE SPEND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE ASSEMBLY ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WHILE THE ASSEMBLY SPENDS MORE THAN THE SENATE -- FOR ONE TIME PURPOSES. THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IS ABOUT ADDRESSING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOUSES OF COURSE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE HOUSES DID TAKE A NUMBER OF IDENTICAL ACTIONS. ON CAL STATE UNIVERSITY IN YOU SEE SUCH AS FINDING COMPENSATION INCREASES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. EACH HOUSE. THIS IS ON PAGE TO EACH HOUSE DOES PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT THE UNIVERSITY'S THOUGH THE HOUSES DIFFER SOMEWHAT. ON THE EXACT LEVELS ENROLLMENT IS COVERED IN ISSUE THIRTY THREE ON THE AGENDA. ACTUAL I DISCUSS LATER HOUSES DIFFER ON FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S RESPECTIVE STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES. PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO UC'S INITIATIVE. PAGE THREE SHOWS EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENT SPENDING PRIORITIES BY THE TWO HOUSES. YOU CAN SEE SOME THERE -- THE BOTTOM OF PAGE THREE NOTES THAT IN A NUMBER OF CASES THE HOUSES ARE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE THE SAME GOALS REALLY BUT THEY DIFFER ON EXACT AMOUNTS THAT THEY PROVIDE OR ON PROGRAMMATIC DETAILS AND SO YOU'LL BE DISCUSSING THAT TO THOSE ISSUES -- LATER TODAY AND PERHAPS TOMORROW MORNING. PAGES FOUR AND FIVE ARE REALLY JUST INTENDED AS A REFERENCE GUIDE THE YOU CAN SEE ALL THE AUGMENTATIONS UNDER THE THREE PLANS. IN ONE PLACE YOU HAVE CSU ON PAGE FOUR AND YOU SEE ON PAGE. FIVE WE WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT ALL THREE PLANS PROVIDE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT. NEW GENERAL FUND RESOURCES FOR EACH. OF THE SEGMENTS ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR YOU SEE US USING FOR CSU INCREASES BY ABOUT A EAR OVER YEAR AND I'M GOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR YOU SEE INCREASES IN THE 78% RANGE YEAR OVER YEAR. SO PAGE SIX THEN SUMMARIZES THE MAJOR COMMONALITIES AND DIFFERENCES FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID. BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY PLANS CONTAIN ADJUSTMENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH. TO FIND GROWTH IN CASELOAD PRIMARILY FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. IN ADDITION BOTH HOUSES MAKE POLICY DECISIONS TO EXPAND CAL GRANT SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS. THE ABILITY HOUSES DO TAKE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. ALSO BOTH HOUSES SEEK TO ADDRESS TEACHER SHORTAGES. AND ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO SAVE FOR COLLEGE THOUGH. THE HOUSE IS TO HAVE DIFFERENCES ON HOW TO GO ABOUT ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS. AS YOU'LL HEAR IN ISSUE THIRTY EIGHT THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED THREE CAL GRANT RELATED -- CHANGES FOR A GROUP OF UNDOCUMENTED AND CERTAIN OTHER STUDENTS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS. AB FINALLY ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE HAND OUT YOU HAVE HERE A A LIST OF ALL THE FINANCIAL AID AUGMENTATIONS. UNDER THE THREE PLANS TO WERE HAPPY. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE OR JUST LAUNCH INTO ISSUE TWENTY SEVEN ON UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA I WOULD ASK MEMBERS ONLY IF YOU HAVE KIND OF A TEN THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL QUESTION ON THE OVERALL LA ALL PRESENTATION IF THE SOMETHING SPECIFIC LET'S WAIT TILL WE GET TO IT ON THE CHIN. ISSUE. ITEM NUMBER SPECIFICALLY MISTER MOORE Là YOU'VE GOTTA. I WOULD JUST MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON PAGE. ONE THAT. YOU YOU PUT A COLUMN BEFORE GOVERNOR THAT SAYS -- LAST YEAR. THE SO WE CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. THAT'S IT MADAM CHAIR FAIR ENOUGH. PLEASE TAKE ON THIS PLAN IS THE MAKE A NOTATION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AVAILABLE FOR WE GET TO THE SPECIFIC ISSUE ITEMS. SEEING NONE LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY SEVEN YOU SEE RETIREMENT PROGRAM. SO THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU INVOLVES OF FUNDING FOR UC'S UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY. HOUSES ADOPTED A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY. EACH ALSO ALSO ADDED CONDITIONS TO THAT FUNDING AND BOTH HOUSES CONDITIONS RELATE TO DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS THAT THE UNIVERSITY OFFERS ITS EMPLOYEES. FOR SOME CONTEXT THE UNIVERSITY OFFERS TWO TYPES OF DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS FOR EMPLOYEES. THE FIRST EFFECTIVELY SUPPLEMENTS PENSION BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND THE SECOND DOT pALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO OPT OUT OF THE PENSION BENEFITS AND ONLY PARTICIPATE IN THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN. THE ISSUE FOR CONFERENCE HERE THAT THE HOUSES DIFFER ON THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS THEY SAID ON THE FUNDING. IN THE SENATE OF THE CONDITIONS ARE MOSTLY AROUND YOU SEE UP STUDYING THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS MORE. STUDYING THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS ON THE FINANCES OF A UC'S -- PENSION SYSTEM AND ALSO A STUDYING THE IMPACT OF THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS ON LOW WAGE WORKERS. THE ASSEMBLY BY CONTRAST A CONDITION THE FUNDING ON YOU SEE. NO LONGER OFFERING DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY UNIONS OPEN CONTRACTS AT THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. ARE CURRENTLY FOR CUSTOM CONTEXT THERE ARE -- TWO UNIONS REPRESENTING FIVE BARGAINING UNITS WITH OPEN CONTRACTS AND THEY REPRESENT ABOUT 17% OF YOU SEE EMPLOYEES SO THAT'S THE ABOUT THE UNIVERSE OF OF INDIVIDUALS TO BE AFFECTED BY -- THIS PROPOSAL THE REMAINING YOU SEE EMPLOYEES WOULD STILL UNDER THE ASSEMBLY ACTION RECEIVE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS THANK YOU. FINANCE LIKE ONE POINT HERE WHICH IS THAT THE GOVERNOR -- INCLUDED THIS IN THE NAY REVISION TO REDUCE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF THE UC RETIREMENT PROGRAMS AND DOESN'T BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE TIED TO ANY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE BETTER ADDRESSED THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. THANK YOU QUESTION THIRTY MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- JUST A FEW THOUGHTS ON A OFFERING A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION OPTION DOES NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT. ON THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN SOMETHING IT IS TO BE RESEARCH BY THE BY THE SENATE REQUESTED THAT. I WOULD JUST SAY THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN IS NOT A PYRAMID SCHEME IT'S NOT RICK. BUT DEPEND ON NEW EMPLOYEES COMING IN. TO TO PROP IT UP WILL ALSO SAY THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAS AN UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT OF NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS IT'S ALSO. A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO TO LOOK AT BUT THE DC PLAN A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN THAT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH JANET NEPAL TANO AND JERRY BROWN WAS. GOING TO BE PROBABLY ONE OF THE FINEST COMPONENTS OF THEIR LEGACY. AND AND SO I GET NERVOUS OR I GET REALLY CONCERNED WHEN IDEAS OF MODIFYING. OF THAT. STRATEGY ARE ARE BROACHED -- DECADES AGO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. TRANSITION DATA DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS BECAUSE THEY COULD FORDHAM AND WE'RE IN A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION WORLD IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR WITH BEEF THEM UP. WHICH IS SORT OF COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT GOING TOWARDS A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION. PLAN IT IS THE PROPER STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING BETTER FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IN THE FUTURE FOR GONNA DIG OUT OF THIS WHOLE WE GOT A START PROVIDING MORE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. BECAUSE IF THE ECONOMY TANKS THEN THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN TENG'S AND THEN THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS GO UP WHEN WERE CUT THE BUDGET I MEAN IT'S JUST. A CONVERGENCE OF TWO TRENDS THAT ARE CHEST -- NASTY AND AND A BEEN THERE DONE THAT. SO CURRENTLY. LISA THE LAST NUMBERS I'VE SEEN UC EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING THE DC OPTION. AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT PERHAPS THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE MILLENNIALS SO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY. TO TRANSPORT THEM THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE PORTABLE SO WHEN THEY LEAVE THEY GET THEIR MONEY MAKE THE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT IN A ROLLOVER IRA. WORK OR WHATEVER. SENATOR GLAZER ROD. PROPOSED A BILL LAST YEAR TO TO ALLOW ALL STATE EMPLOYEES TO HAVE THE OPTION YOU WANT TO BE A DC OR D. B.. AND THAT BILL FAILED BUT THAT IS GOING TO BE I THINK IN THE FUTURE THE DIRECTION WE SHOULD BE GOING. ESPECIALLY FOR FOCUS ON FINANCIAL VIABILITY SO SO PLEASE PLEASE WE SHOULDN'T BE GOING BACK TO ADJUST THE BE FOR EVERYBODY -- YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT'S WORKING AT UC AND IT'S A MODEL. FOR THE REST OF THE STATE. THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU AND WE APPRECIATE THEM SENATOR ROBB. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- ONE MOVE YOUR DECISION HERE. OF THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WAS -- TO MAKE THE FUNDING CONTINGENT ON ELIMINATING THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION OPTION A SENATOR AND IT OCCURRED TO US TO ME THAT. THE ONLY REASON -- TO DO THAT WOULD BE IF THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN. AND THE PARTICIPATION HAD SOME ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN BY CAUSING EMPLOYEES WHO -- WOULD OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN THAT PLAN TO FLIP TO A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN SOMEHOW IMPACTING THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN IF IN FACT IT DID. AND SO -- WHAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE DECIDED TO DO WAS CONDITION THE -- THE FLOW OF FUNDS TO A DETERMINATION THAT IN FACT THERE WOULD BE NO IMPACT ON THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. FROM CONTINUING TO DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN OPTIONS SO THAT'S WHY THIS LANGUAGE WAS PREPARED THE WAY IT WAS NOT TO PRESUME THAT THERE WAS ANY. ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN [inaudible] BUT TO SET THE CONDITION FOR THE FLOW OF THE MONEY. AS OPPOSED TO THE CONDITION BEING THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION OPTION. MAY I RESPOND MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU I'M. SIR ROTH I'M IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN YEARS AGO. A CALIFORNIA'S NEGOTIATED -- A NEW FEAR FOR ITS EMPLOYEES. AND WHO WE SAID YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE A LOWER. FORMULA AND WILL HAVE A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN WITH IT. SO THAT I WILL PUT IN YOU PUT INTO PERCENT WILL PUT INTO PERCENT AND AND AND SO WAS A HYBRID. AND SO THAT THAT WAS AGREED TO BY THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS AND AND THE ELECTION WAS MADE AT THE DATA HIGHER. BUT WE ALSO NEGOTIATED THAT YOU COULD. GO OUT OF THE D. B. PLAN INTO THE DC PLAN IF YOU IF YOU WANTED. TO WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE REQUEST. THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT WE RAN INTO INTERNAL REVENUE. SERVICE REV RULING TWO THOUSAND SIX HIGH FROM. FORTY THREE WHICH SAID THAT. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T MOVE INTO ANOTHER CLAN. YOU ONLY GET ONE CHOICE NOT TO AND IF YOU HAVE A SECOND CHOICE YOU JEOPARDIZE THE TAX. EXEMPT STATUS OF THE DB PLAN. AND SO WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THAT REPRESENT. TEN YEARS LATER -- THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS LIKE ASK ME AND S. CI YOU AND AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL HAVE BEEN PRETTY PERSUASIVE WITH THE US TREASURY. DEPARTMENT AND THE IRS TO NOT CHANGE THAT RECRUIT SO SO RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THAT UNLESS WE HAVE A A MAJOR CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW. SO I COULD SAVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. IN DOING A STUDY. BASED ON JUST THE THE FUND WE'VE HAD AN ORANGE COUNTY. MAYBE I STAND I THOUGHT THE THE PROPOSAL WAS TO ELIMINATE THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION. PLAN OPTION FOR EMPLOYEES RIGHT RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST IT'S OPTIONAL. SO WHEN YOU BECOME AN EMPLOYEE OF THE UC SYSTEM YOU CAN SAY DO I WON'T BE IN THE DB PLAN OR THE DC PLAN RIGHT AND 37% FROM SAID WILL TAKE THE DEATH. THE CITY. BUT IT DOESN'T ELIMINATED THE BE PLAN. PERHAPS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSAL I THOUGHT THE PROPOSAL WAS THAT A DEFINED BENEFIT DOT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN BE OFFERED TO REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES. YEAH RIGHT YEAH THAT THAT THE TICKET HERE THEY WANT TO ELIMINATE THE WHOLE PROPOSITION WHICH I DON'T THINK IT'S A WITHOUT A GOOD FISCAL MOVE I THINK WE'RE SAYING THE SAME THING. AND WHAT I SAID WAS I WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT. UNLESS THERE WAS SOME ADVERSE IMPACT ON A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. AND TO MY NEEDS TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOT YOU SAY THERE WILL BE I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS NOT -- EMPLOYEES WHO MOVE IN WHO MOVE OUT OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN BEFORE VESTING. USED TO BE THEY HAD TO LEAVE THE MONEY IN THE PLAN IS THAT STILL THE CASE -- IT DEPENDS ON HOW IT'S WORDED BUT IN ORANGE COUNTY IF YOU WERE THERE FOR FIVE YEARS OR LESS. YOU WOULD YOU WOULD -- LOSE THE CONTRIBUTION THAT WAS MADE BY THE EMPLOYER BUT YOU WOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR THE HIGH FISHING YOU MADE SO YOU RUN OUT OF POCKET RIGHT AND SO WITH A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN. IF EMPLOYEES MOVED TO THAT INSTEAD OF A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN AND THEY LEAVE. BEFORE THE NORMAL FASTING YOU LOSE THAT COMPONENT OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT'S LEFT IN THE PLAN. THAT WOULD BE AN ACTUARIAL RIGHT I'M XIN CÃM THAT'S WHY WE LET'S. THAT'S WHERE WHO HOW MANY PEOPLE LEAVE BEFORE THE FIVE YEARS. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHY WE'RE CALLING FOR NATURAL NOTICES. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. THIS IS WHAT CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IS ALL ABOUT. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE. TWENTY SEVEN YES WITH MACE. I SUIT THE ENJOYED THIS DIALOGUE A LITTLE BIT ACTUALLY REMINDED ME OF WHEN I WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF TO COUNTY SUPERVISOR SUPERVISOR SAM YOU KNOW COUNTY. THAT WE WANTED TO GO THE LEARN FROM THE LEGEND WHO'S WHO'S NOW AT THE TIME WAS A SUPERVISOR DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY I DON'T THINK WE IN A SETTING UP THAT MEETING BUT ANYWAY JUST FROM. REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE CENTER MORE LOCK WAS IT AN EXPERT -- IN IN THESE MATTERS. IT'S INTERESTING THOUGH I'VE GOTTEN AT THE TIME I WAS ACTUALLY I WAS A FINANCIAL ADVISER ONE POINT TIME IN MY LIFE I'M A LITTLE RUSTY ON THAT. ON THOSE THINGS NOW BY THE TIME I WAS NOT A FAN OF THE DB PLAN AT ALL -- IN FACT I WANTED ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO GO TO A TO DC PLAN AND I REMEMBER -- SHUT SHALL I DARE SAY THAT WHEN I WAS CAMPAIGNING I WAS REMINDED OF THAT -- FROM A FEW FROM A FEW FOLKS INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THOUGH I'M NOT OPPOSED TO A TO A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN -- THE SEMINAL COUNTY IS A THIRTY SEVEN ACT COUNTY HAS -- SB SIR AND I LEARNED IT OFF A LOT ABOUT DB PLANS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I LEARNED AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME CLARIFICATION MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN HELP ME BECAUSE ON THE SENATE PROPOSALTHAT FIRST QUESTION THAT'S THERE. THAT SAYS TO SUBMIT AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS VERIFYING THAT OFFERING A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION OPTION DOES NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THE DEFINED. BENEFIT PLAN. AND I I THINK IF I IF I HEARD -- OUT MY MY THE THE LEGEND -- AT TALK SAYING THAT -- THAT -- NEW EMPLOYEES IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BE HURTFUL BUT BUT IN IT IN ACTUALITY WHEN WHEN A WHEN THEY'RE WHEN A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN ISN'T PROPERLY FUNDED. IN ESSENCE THE EXISTING EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY PAYING FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE RETIREES THE ONLY WAY. I'M NOT SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW THIS WORKS BETWEEN BUT WITH THIS NEW PROPOSAL THAT YOU SEE HAS AND HOW YOU'RE MOVING PEOPLE FROM A DB PLAN OVER TO DC PLAN. THAT COULD END UP HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE DB PLAN OUT OF YOU CAN CAN HELP ME WITH THAT -- CAN SPEAK BRIEFLY TO THAT -- FIRST -- WITH REGARDS TO THE LEGEND -- I JUST SAY THAT WHEN I WAS IN. BUSINESS SCHOOL WE DIDN'T DO A CASE STUDY ON SENATOR MORLOCK BUT WE DID ONE ON HIS PREDECESSOR. IRAN AGAINST YES. READ TO ME -- TO ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE I THINK THE POINT SENATOR MORE LIKE IT'S MAKING IS WHEN A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN IS FUNDED PROPERLY -- ANY BENEFIT THAT A CRUISE IN THAT YEAR SHOULD BE FUNDED IN THAT YEAR AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE BEYOND THAT SHOULD BE THROUGH A VEST AND RETURNS. ON IN PRACTICE -- SOMETIMES WITH THE SYSTEMS WE SEEN ON UNFUNDED LIABILITY IN IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AGO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN OVER FUNDED IN THAT HAS FLUCTUATED -- I GUESS I'LL MAKE TWO POINTS THOUGH I THINK THE FIRST IS THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO A SYSTEM THAT IS UNFUNDED USUALLY IT'S THE EMPLOYER THAT -- STEPS UP AND FEELS THAT ACTUARIAL UNFUNDED LIABILITY -- AND WE'RE SEEING THAT IN THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD I GUESS A COUPLE HOURS AGO WHEN IT CAME TO SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL CALPERS CONTRIBUTIONS THOSE ARE COMING FROM -- FUTURE EMPLOYEES THOSE ARE ACTUALLY COMING FROM THE STATE OR THE EMPLOYER IN THIS CASE -- WHEN IT COMES MORE SPECIFICALLY TO MONEY IN THE SYSTEM AND WHETHER PEOPLE ARE LEAVING IT THERE THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SOME FLUCTUATIONS BASED ON WHETHER THE SYSTEM ALLOWS THE MONEY TO BE WATCHED THEIR? WHETHER PEOPLE TAKE THE MONEY WITH THEM WHAT INTEREST RATE YOU'RE SETTING ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE INVESTED YET BUT I CONTINUES TO ACCUMULATE IN THE SYSTEM SO. THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM SOME STUDY -- BUT THE BROADER POINT AND I ENJOYED THIS DISCUSSION AS WELL BUT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE THIS CONTRIBUTION WITHOUT WAITING INTO THIS WHOLE DEBATE. MANAGER IF I CAN. JUST DO USUALLY IN AGAIN I'M A LITTLE RUSTY WITH THESE THINGS BUT THERE'S THAT FIVE YEAR AVERAGE -- AND YEAH WITH THE DISCOUNT RATE IS IS DROPPED BY THE SYSTEM USUALLY EMPLOYER INCREASES THEIR THEIR AND CAUGHT THE CONTRIBUTIONS BASED UPON. THEM THE EXISTING EMPLOYEES THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SO I GUESS THAT WOULD BE TO ME ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WOULD BE. INTERESTING TO LOOK AT IS IS IS WHAT THE THE IMPACT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE A BY BY MOVING PEOPLE OVER BETWEEN FROM THE DB PLAN OVER OVER TO THE DC PLAN IS THAT NOT IS THAT NOT TRUE. SO I I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND SO I THINK THERE'S TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT FIRST IS WHEN THERE IS AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY. THOSE ARE FOR YEARS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN WORKED RIGHT IN THE PAST AND SO THE WAY THE SYSTEMS OFTEN ACCOUNT FOR THAT IS BASED ON THEIR PRESENT EMPLOYEES. THEY SAID A RATE -- AND THEN THE ALLOCATED ON AND YOU SEE THAT ON YOUR PAGE ON YOUR PAYCHECK OR YOUR PAYSTUB WHEN YOU GET IT. BUT THE FACT IS IF YOU HAD FEWER EMPLOYEES IT WOULD JUST BE BIGGER PER EMPLOYEE SO THAT RESPONSIBILITY IS STILL ON THE EMPLOYER NO MATTER HOW MANY EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE SO. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THAT AMOUNT AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY FLUCTUATE AGAIN THESE ARE ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES IF YOU KNOW FOR HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM -- IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FOR NEW EMPLOYEES FOR OUT IT IS FOR THE STATE FOR PEOPLE BEGUN AFTER TWENTY THIRTEEN BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUR NORMAL COST -- THE RATE IS NOT SECTOR BARGAINING BUT FLUCTUATES FOR BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE SO -- IN THAT CASE WHEN THE DISCOUNT RATE TO YOUR POINT FLUCTUATES THAN BOTH PEOPLE'S COST FLUCTUATE BUT THOSE ARE NOT FOR THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THOSE ARE FOR BENEFITS THAT ACCRUE. IN THE PRESENT HERE [inaudible] OKAY. YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO FUND OF THE BENEFIT TOUCH ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING CORRECT YES. IT'S A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN SO YOU GUARANTEE A BENEFIT TO SOMEBODY. BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW YES AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. IN THE BUCKET TO PAY THOSEBENEFITS YES SO YOU FUND TO THE BENEFIT. SO THAT'S WHY IF THE MARKET TANKS. IF YOU THE EMPLOYER. YOU GET YOUR CHECKBOOK OUT. AND FUNDED THE BENEFIT. NOW I'M NOT THE CPA NOR MY AN ACTUARY BUT THERE THERE'S A WAY THEY CALCULATE THAT. AND THAT'S HOW IT WORKS RIGHT YEAH. NO THAT'S THAT THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING BUT THAT'S NOT BUT I THOUGHT I HEARD SO WHAT AT THIS. SENATOR ROBB I THINK ACTUALLY -- IF IF WHAT HE JUST SAID IS ACCURATE THEN YES WE'VE ANSWERED MY QUESTION THIS MY UNDERSTANDING THANK YOU. THE FRONT YOU PAY YOU PAY THE BENEFIT OUT THE BENEFIT I A DEFINED BENEFIT SO WHATEVER IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW IS PRESENTLY INTERPRETED THAT IS. THAT BENEFIT IS PAID OUT TO BE READ TO THE RETIREE I THINK YOU'RE MAKING AT SOME A DIFFERENT POINT ALSO WHICH IS THAT. IT'S ALL BEING PAID OUT OF THAT YOU KNOW CALPERS HAS THREE HUNDRED AND SOME ODD BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT LEVEL WAS FLUCTUATING BASED ON THE MARKET. IT'S ALSO FLUCTUATING BASED ON HOW MANY PEOPLE AE PAYING AND PAYING OUT SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT IT SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE PAYING INTO CALPERS THAN YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THERE IS MORE MONEY IN THAT FUND AND SO MONIES GOING OUT IN MONIES GOING AND BUT SENATOR MORE LIKE IS ALSO. CORRECT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING AND MONEY IF THE DISCOUNT RATE IS SET APPROPRIATELY THEY ARE FINDING THEIR OWN RETIREMENT AND NOT NECESSARILY OTHERS RETIREMENT. MADAM CHAIR IF I CAN ASK THIS ONE OF COURSE THE CURRENT FUNDED -- RATIO FOR THE UC SYSTEM. EACH OF OCT WE HAVE THESE. KURT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE UC INDICATES OF ITS MOST RECENT REPORT FROM JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT THEY WERE IT 85% FUNDED. WHICH IS GOOD LEAVING AT TEN BILLION DOLLAR OF TAX LIABILITY FAIRLY GOOD. LIKE THAT THANK. BUT THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WRITTEN FROM HEARD BY THE THE PRIOR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE STATED THAT THERE WAS A NINETEEN BILLION DOLLAR UNFUNDED RETIREE MEDICAL SOLIDS. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE TACKLED. JUST JUST HURRY UP. CERTAINLY AND I JUST KNOW THAT THAT'S A REGION TOLD YOU KNOW DISCUSSION. ON HEALTHCARE BENEFITS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE. WHEN THE EIGHT ANOTHER BIGGIE SEISMIC RETROFIT? HELLO. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS AN ASSEMBLY ACTION TO PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR A PILOT TO PROVIDE SEISMIC RENOVATIONS AT THE UC. ALL THE WAY THIS WOULD WORK IS -- THE CAMPUS AT CAMPUSES RIVER WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THERE WOULD BE AN EXPECTATION OF A OF A MATCH WITH NON STATE FUNDING -- THAT ACCORDING TO STAFFTHE INTENTION OF THE PROPOSAL IS -- TO INCENTIVIZE MORE PRIVATE GIFT GIVING OFFER PROJECTS LIKE SEISMIC OF RENOVATIONS. WE WOULD NOTE HERE THAT -- SO IT'S A GREAT EVASIONS ARE REASONABLE USE OF ONE TIME FUNDING THAT SAID WE RAISE TWO ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS IT'S WEIGHING THIS PROPOSAL AGAINST OTHER ONE TIME OPTIONS. THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE HAS -- PROCESSES IN PLACE AT THE MOMENT TO FIND YOU SEE FACILITY PROJECTS. INCLUDING RENOVATION PROJECTS. NOWADAYS WE TYPICALLY DO IT THROUGH BY UNIVERSITY BONDS THAT FINANCE OF THE PROJECTS WE PAID BACK THE ASSOCIATED UP THE GENERAL FUND. ON TO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW HOW THIS NEW PILOT WOULD INTERACT WITH THOSE EXISTING PROCESSES. AND SECOND WE KNOW THAT AND SOME CASES CAMPUSES DO ALREADY MATCH STATE FUNDING WITH NON STATE FUNDING TYPICALLY THIS NON STATE FUNDING INCLUDES THINGS LIKE -- OVERHEAD ON FEDERAL RESEARCH GRANTS -- INVESTMENT RETURNS IN CERTAIN -- MONEY ACCOUNTS AND THIS OCCURS SOMETIMES EVEN FOR SEISMIC RENOVATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS YEAR THE STATE DID APPROVE -- RENOVATION PROJECT AT UC BERKELEY ABOUT ALONE MORE THAN HALF OF THAT PROJECT WOULD BE FUNDED WITH IN THIS EXISTING PRACTICE FROM A LEGIT LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT ADDITIONAL. ON THINGS IS HOPING TO LEARN AS A RESULT OF THE PILOT. THANK YOU. FINANCE. SO WE THIS CALL IS A LAUDABLE GOAL WE BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED TO LA OWES -- COMMENT AT THROUGH THE UC BUDGET. THANK YOU ARE TO THE LA -- WHAT DETERMINES ELIGIBILITY? DO YOU HAVE A SENSE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE PROGRAM ELIGIBLE CAMPUSES -- YOU KNOW I I HAVEN'T SEEN THETRAILER LEGISLATION YET SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO ALL THE SPECIFICS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT WILL. PRIMARILY BE BASED ON HOW WHAT WHAT NON STATE FUNDS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MATCH WITH THE STATE FUNDING I CAN'T COMMENT MUCH MORE THAT SINGS SECIFIC LANGUAGE. WE GONNA COME IN THIS MCCARTY AT THE NOTION WAS TO ALL UC CAMPUSES. THANK YOU WHO COULD WHO COULD HAVE THE MATCHING FUNDS THOSE WHO COULD. PUT UP [inaudible] SKINNER. ON OTHER CAMPUSES HAVE ANYWAY -- DE. WHEN ELLIE -- RESPONSE THAT THE STATE HAS MECHANISMS FOR FINDING THESE NEEDS -- DO I DON'T HAVE THE DATA BEFORE ME BUT LAST I CHECKED. THE IT. SEISMIC NEED THE NEED THE COST. TO GET. THE UC BUILDINGS THAT ARE NOT UP TO ASSIST THE THE SEISMIC CODE THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TODAY -- IS BEYOND ANYTHING THAT WE EITHER HAVE BONDS OR CAPITAL AT LEE AND IN FACT THE AS A LEGISLATURE WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED YOU SEE VERY MUCH CAPITAL MONIES -- SO I MEAN IT. YEAH WE MAY HAVE SOME MECHANISMS BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVEN'T BEEN. FINDING ANY OF THE CAPUSES OR THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE FOR CAPITAL NEEDS AT ANY RATE THAT IS NEEDED. FOR YEARS AND FOR THE SEISMIC NEED -- WE HAVE I'M SURE MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES KNOW CAMPUSES THAT ARE DIRECTLY ON FAULTS I MEAN LITERALLY THE HAYWARD FAULT RUNS THROUGH THE UC BERKELEY CAMPUS IT ISOUR OLDEST CAMPUS IT HAS QUITE A FEW. BUILDINGS. THAT -- PROVIDE ACTIVE INSTRUCTION EVERYDAY BUT ARE NOT UP TO THE SEISMIC CODE UCLA IS IF IT IS NOT DIRECTLY ON A FAULT IT IS IN CLOSE CLOSE PROXIMITY. AND SURE RIVERSIDE SIMILARLY AND MANY OF OUR OTHER UC CAMPUSES -- SO -- I I SUPPOSE I WOULD -- IF WE WERE NOT. TO ACT ON THE ASSEMBLY TO REQUEST I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME FUNDING FOR SEISMIC RETROFIT BECAUSE IT IS A VERY SERIOUS NEED. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. I MIGHT HAVE SOME MINUTES EARLIER MISSION JUST TO HELP -- YEAH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED THE FIRST WITH QUESTION WAS JUST ON GENERAL NEED. AND YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK OF THIS I I DON'T I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LANGUAGE -- BUT IF IT'S IF THAT'S ASSUMING THERE'S A ONE TO ONE MATCH YOU'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE. FOR SEISMIC RENOVATIONS NOT GETTING ABOUT IT'S ABOUT FIVE TO MAYBE TEN PROJECTS -- IN THE UNIVERSITIES CURRENTLY STUDYING AT SEISMIC NEEDS ITS IMPLEMENTING KIND OF A A STUDY THAT IT'S ABOUT 70% DONE WITH AND SO ONCE IT'S COME CONCLUDED WITH THAT STUDY WOULD MIGHT AND WE MAY HAVE A KIND OF BROADER SENSE OF THE OVERALL NEED ACROSS THE SYSTEM. BOTH HOUSES ALSO ADOPT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HAVE A REQUIRE UNIT YOU UNIVERSITY TO STUDY AT SEISMIC NEEDS SO THE LEGISLATURE IS EXPECTING THE UNIVERSITY TO COME BACK WITH THE FULLER ASSESSMENT OF THOSE NEEDS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AND THEN JUST TO THAT A SECOND QUESTION ABOUT THE EXISTING PROCESS THE WITH EXISTING PROCESS WORKS AS THE UNIVERSITY RAISES BONTA USES THE GENERAL FUND TO PAY BACK THE ASSOCIATED DEBT. ON THE UNIVERSITY CURRENTLY USES THOSE BONDS FOR WRITING PROJECTS INCLUDE NEW BUILDINGS AND THEY ALSO INCLUDE SEISMIC RENOVATIONS% ANOTHER SORT OF SORTS OF THINGS LIKE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR EXAMPLE. ONE ISSUE THAT -- IT IS RAISED EACH YEAR IS HOW THE UNIVERSITY PRIORITIZES ALL THESE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND ROMAN GROWTH SEISMIC NEEDS -- AND UNIVERSITY RIGHT NOW TRIES TO WORK WITH THE CAMPUS IS TO IDENTIFY THEIR HIGHEST NEEDS AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS THAT. THEY FIND ENROLLMENT GROWTH ANOTHER YEARS IT WILL PROJECTS THAT SUPPORTED WOMAN GROWTH A NEW FACILITY SOMETIMES THAT MEANS THERE SEISMIC RENOVATIONS IT KIND OF VARIES BY CAMPUS SO THERE HAVE BEEN. A SOME SEISMIC PROJECTS OVERALL BUT THERE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY'VE ADDRESSED -- THAT FULLY MEDIA ESPECIALLY IN OLDER CAMPUSES WERE YOU HAVE -- OLDER FACILITIES. THANK YOU SENATOR ROBB. WELL I JUST WANNA MAKE THE POINT I MEAN WE HEARD. WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION ABOUT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND AS I RECALL IN THE UC SYSTEM IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE OVER FOUR BILLION OR SOMETHING IN THE CSU SYSTEM IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE OVER FOUR BILLION SO IT'S TOTAL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS. FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION. AS TO WHETHER SEISMIC WAS INCLUDED IN THAT -- AS I RECALL THE ANSWER WAS NOT -- HENCE THE NEED FOR THE STUDY IN MY REQUESTED. TO INSTEAD OF TWENTY THIRTY THAT IT SPEED UP A LITTLE BIT AND WE GET AN IDEA AND A HANDLE ON WHAT THE TOTAL SEISMIC NEED IS SO WE CAN ADD THAT TO THE EIGHT OR NINE BILLION AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO FUND IT. AS A STATE SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A PRETTY OOD START BUT WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO WHEN IT COMES. TO SEISMIC RETROFIT IN OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT PHILANTHROPY PROBABLY WON'T TOTALLY ADDRESS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT THANKS FOR THE EFFORT. THANK YOU MOVING ON TO ISSUE TWENTY NINE VERY FEW SEE ADJUSTMENTS LA -- SO THE ITEM BEFORE YOU PRESENTS A SERIES OF DIFFERENT CONFERENCE ISSUES RELATED TO THE UC BUDGET FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ALL ADDRESS JUST THE THE OF THE LARGEST ISSUE FOR EACH HOUSE -- ON THE SENATE SIDE THE LARGEST ISSUE HERE IS FUNDING FOR THE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE MORE STATE SUPPORT PER STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL AND ALSO EXPAND THE SCHOOLS ENROLLMENT CURRENTLY THE SCHOOL SERVES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS IN THE OVER ARCHING OBJECTIVE IS. TO ROUGHLY DOUBLE THAT TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS -- THE FUNDING WOULD THE WANT THERE'S ONE TIME AND I'M GOING FUNDING THERE THE ONE TIME FUNDING WOULD BE TO FIND ANEW -- FACILITY FOR THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE -- AND THEN THE ONGOING FUNDING WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STATE SUPPORT CURRENTLY THE SCHOOL RECEIVES FIFTEEN MILLION AND STATE SUPPORT -- SO THIS WOULD INCREASE IT AT ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE FOR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL GENERAL GENERAL FUND SUPPORT DIRECTLY TO THE SCHOOL. THE LARGEST INITIATIVE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE IS TO PROVIDE. A NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FNDING -- THAT'S LARGELY UNRESTRICTED THE OVER THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ONE TIME FUNDING IS TO CARRY OVER OUR EARTH TO SUSTAIN ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ARE THE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED A LARGE AMOUNT OF UNRESTRICTED ONE TIME FUNDS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND SAYS THAT IT USE THOSE FUNDS -- FOR LARGELY ON GOING PURPOSES THINGS LIKE HIRING MORE FACULTY PROVIDING OR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- IN THE IT DIDN'T INTEND HERE'S ASSISTING THOSE ACTIVITIES FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN PROVIDING A MORE ONE TIME FUNDING TO UNIVERSITY. TO CONSIDER WAYS -- TO BUT PROVIDE MORE CLARITY ON WHAT SCHOOLS ARE FOR THE ONE TIME FUNDING AND IDENTIFY -- POTENTIALLY ONE TIME USES SO THAT THE UNIVERSITY SPEND THEM ON ONE TIME PURPOSES AND DOESN'T CREATE A COST PRESSURE FOR THE STATE -- IN THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE SO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE YOU SEE DYSLEXIA CENTER OF FUNDING THESE ITEMS ARE NOT IN OUR BUDGET. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR MAYES. I JUST HAVE TO TO JUMP IN HERE -- JUST TO TALK ABOUT THE UC RIVERSIDE MEDICAL SCHOOL -- BUT THIS IS A A HUGE WAS A HUGE WIN FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE THE TWO COUNTIES -- IT NEEDS TO BE FULLY FUNDED -- BUT I KNOW -- THE MY COLLEAGUE -- WHO I THINK DO YOU REPRESENT -- BUT THE UC ARE I DO NOT -- BUT I I DO KNOW THAT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND FACT INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT -- INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS IN THE TO COUNTY A REGION -- AND IT IS -- AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS IF WE CAN GET SOME FOLKS TRAINED THERE GET THEM TO LOVE THE OTHER COMMUNITY HOPEFULLY THEY WILL END UP -- END UP DOING A RESIDENCY CLOSE BY AND THEN AND THEN STAYING THERE SO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE. I LOVE THIS IS GONNA BE A UC RIVERSIDE MINUTES WHO LOVE FEST OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS. IT REALLY IS GOOD FOR THE WHOLE STATE IS WE'VE NOT EXPANDED MED SCHOOL PUBLICLY FUNDED MET SCHOOLS IN. GENERATIONS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON ISSUE. TWENTY NINE RESIST THE URGE TO CLOSE OUT ON THAT ONE RIGHT NOW -- LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE THIRTY NEW CAMPUS STUDY WE MAKE TO THIS EARLIER EL AL AS FULL HOUSES PROVIDE THE SAME AMOUNT FOR THIS ISSUE THE HOUSES DO DIFFER SOMEWHAT. ON THE SPECIFIC REGIONS OR CITIES FOR THE CSU CHANCES OFFICE TO STUDY WHETHER NEEDEXISTS FOR A NEW CAMPUS THERE. OF JUST WANTED TO NOTE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THAT AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO SELECTING REGION'S LARGEST STUDY WOULD BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO AGREE ON FACTORS. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN ASSESSING WHETHER A NEED EXISTS FOR A NEW CAMPUS FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD LOOK AT FACTORS SUCH AS LOW COLLEGE GOING RATES IN AN AREA. FOR LONG COMMUTING DISTANCE TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. AS FACTORS THE LEGISLATURE COULD THEN DIRECT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO LOOK AT ALL AREAS OF THE STATE AND SEE WHICH ONES MEET THOSE CRITERIA -- AND INVEST MAY WARRANT TO NEW CAMPUS. OUR LIST OF WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO GO WITH THE REGIONAL STUDY APPROACH -- STATEWIDE APPROACH WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT EVEN ONE CAMPUS WOULD INCREASE CONSIDERABLY BE OUT YOUR COSTS ARE YOU HAPPY. ONE TIME CAPITAL COSTS AND OF COSTS TO OPERATE A CAMPUS WHICH ARE QUITE A BIT HIGHER -- FOR YOU CAMPUS AS OPPOSED -- TO EXISTING CAMPUSES AND AND IN RETURN THE STATE'S WAS CLOUT OUTLOOK WOULD BE IMPACTED WHEN YOU HAVE THESE ARE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT HIGHER COSTS RIGHT NO QUESTION. FINANCE. THEY SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUSES ON SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY THERE ARE A LOT OF LOCAL LEADERS IN THE STOCKTON AREA WHO ARE REALLY INVESTED. IN THIS STUDY AND SO THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOES HAVE AN EMPHASIS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR MORE LOT. MANAGER -- SINCE WE MENTION ORANGE COUNTY -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE INITIATED SUBSEQUENT TO THE BANKRUPTCY FILING WAS A TEN YEAR STRATEGIC FINANCIAL PLAN. SO WE COULD SEE WERE GOING WHAT WHAT WHAT A DECISION TODAY. HOW WOULD IT IMPACT IS TEN YEARS OUT? AND SO. I'VE BEEN I SERVED ON SUB ONE FOR THE FIRST FOUR YEARS. AND I ASKED FOR A TEN YEAR PLAN FROM. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AND I WAS TOLD NO. ARE NOT GONNA DO THAT FOR YOU. SO IT'S A LITTLE INTERESTING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT A NEW CAMPUS BUT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A TEN YEAR. STRATEGIC FINANCIAL PLAN. FOR THE CURRENT. CAMPUSES IN HOW ARE WE GONNA DIG OUT IN AND IMPROVE OUR BALANCE SHEET -- BEFORE WE ADD ANOTHER. CAMPUS I'M NOT SAYING DON'T BUILDING CAMPUS OR DON'T DO THE RESEARCH UNDERSTAND. MAYBE THAT THE STUDY SHOULD E A LITTLE MORE -- BROUGHT IT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE THE BIG PICTURE HOW DO WE HOW DO WE SUSTAIN THIS. OTHERWISE WE'RE LOOKING AT MASSIVE TUITION INCREASES RIGHT WHICH ARE UNTENABLE SO I'M. JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE WILL BALANCE AS WE PURSUE THIS. IT IN A MY QUESTION FOR YOU THAT YOU ASKED THEM FOR TEN YEAR FINANCIAL PLAN OR A TEN YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN IN TERMS OF HOW THEY INTEND. TO EDUCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA KIDS FINANCIAL PLAN JUST TEN COLUMNS IN AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET. AND AND BASS BUT REALLY WAS FINANCIAL NOT IN TERMS OF THEIR STRATEGY ABOUT GROWTH AND EXPANSION PROGRAM I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING AS IT GOES -- YOU KNOW PUT JUST HOUSE THE HOUSE AGO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO REDUCE. YOUR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES JUST CHECK OUT WHAT. WHAT'S THE TEN YEAR PLAN IS NOT THAT LONG -- IN IN SO -- BUT I JUST WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD THAT WE NEED TO START DOING A LITTLE MORE. THINKING AHEAD ON HOW IT ALL FITS IN AND SO WE DON'T LEAVE A MESS TO THOSE TO SUCCEED IS MR MAYES. REALLY LOVE THE ASSEMBLY MAP OF A PLAN -- HERE COULD BE -- THAT THERE IS A THE PALM DESERT IS IN HERE -- I DO KNOW ON OUR SIDE THERE'S A HANDFUL OF US MEMBERS -- WHO HAVE THIS AMBITION OF HAVING FULL FLEDGED CAMPUSES? BUT TO CENTER MORE LOCKS POINT WE REALLY DO NEED TO HAVE THIS -- THIS GOAL IN THIS PLAN FOR ALL OVER CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. WE DO HAVE ARE YOU SEE WE ALSO HAVE CAL STATE MAKES SENSE FOR THERE TO BE ONE AND IN PALM DESERT YET IF YOU LOOK AT THIS SHOULD NOT BE WANTED TO THIS -- NOT ONE IN SAN MATEO COUNTY OF COURSE THE ONE THAT I KNOW THAT -- DOCTOR AGAIN IS LOOKING -- FOR IN IN IN STOCKTON AND SO THIS IDEA OF DOING A COMPREHENSIVE A PLAN OF WHERE THOSE NEXT -- BUSINESS NEXT THE FULL INDEPENDENT ACCOUNT STATES ARE GOING TO BE I THINK MAKES AN AWFUL LOT AS A LOT OF SENSE. THE REASON IM I LIKE THE SPELLING OUT WHERE THE BOAT WE'RE GONNA DO THE STUDYING IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE CAL STATE SYSTEM HAS THEIR OWN CONSTITUENCY. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POLITICAL DYNAMICS AND AND THEY THEY OFTENTIMES WANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING ON THEIR CAR WHERE THEIR CURRENT CAMPUSES ARE OUT THEY DON'T WANT EXPAND JUST FOR THOSE REASONS THEY GOT LIMITED RESOURCES THEY GOT BIG AMBITIONS. TO TO SPEND MONEY THERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT TO LIST THESE AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE. FOR US TO CONSIDER THOSE FOUR SITES THANK YOU BACK TO WHEREVER I WAS -- IT OUGHT. TO LIVE THIS IS DOWN THERE BECAUSE THEY THEY'VE GIVEN THE GAS ALMOST. THREE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED BEGIN ACRES OF LAND TO BUILD THE CAMPUS FREE TO STATE SO ANALYSTS AT BEAUTIFUL AND IN FACT. BUT THE ARE CHALLENGES CONTINUES TO BE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN. AND WE DON'T AND SO THERE FOR EVERYBODY WHO WANTS SOMETHING HAS A TENDENCY TO THROW IN TO TRY TO GET IT AND AND TO KIND OF PUSH FOURTH. WE NEED A HIGHER IT COMMISSION THAT LIKE WE USED TO HAVE THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THE SOMETIMES THE PLANET MASS THAT WOULD WRITE THE MASTER PLAN TO DEAL WITH AND ROLL MY CHANGES AND ALL THE STUFF WE TRIED WE TRIED IT FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PROPOSAL TO HAD TO DO SEE PACKING YET AND BOB PAST GOVERNOR ALWAYS VETOED IT BECAUSE HE GOT RID OF IT AND DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK. BUT I THINK THERE MAY BE ONE OR TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION FLOATING AROUND NOW HOPEFULLY THAT MAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THAT MAY ONCE AGAIN ESTABLISHED THIS HIGHER IT COMMISSION. THAT WHOSE JOB WOULD BE TO DO THAT AND THEREFORE YOU TAKE A LOT OF THE POLITICS OUT OF IT. BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE LOOKING AT ENROLLMENT TRANS CURRICULUM WHAT KINDS OF DEGREES UNNECESSARY SO FORTH AND SO ON WERE YOU GOING TO FIND IT WHERE YOU LOCATED AND THAT'S HOW YOU. YOU DEVELOP A PLAN THAT'S HOW YOU GET ON THE LIST BUT TEN YEARS TO GET SAN MARCOS SO WHERE PEOPLE OR WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING TO BE BUT IT JUST TAKES A POLITICS OUT OF IT AND AS A RESULT IT FOCUSES ON WHERE THE NEEDS ARE. WITH THE ENROLLMENT IS YOU KNOW WITH THE GROWTH MAY BE IN EVEN IN AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A CAMPUS LIKE -- IN COACHELLA YOU KNOW THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE DATA SHOW THAT PROBABLY THERE'S NOT POPULATION ENOUGH TO TO HAVE A CAMPUS -- THEY DO NEED TO COMMUNICATE ALLEGE THAT THEY DO NEED SOME OTHER KINDS OF THEORIES SAID THIS SO. YOU KNOW BUT I JUST THINK -- HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOMETHING THAT WILL GIVE US MORE THAN JUST EVERY NOW AND THEN WE CAN GET TWO MILLION DOLLARS A BILL STUDY TOGETHER. AND AND THEN MAKE A DECISION MAYBE -- THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN -- BUT WE NEED AN ONGOING DISCUSSION WE HAVE A HUGE SYSTEM. ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE THAT REALLY NEEDS THAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FROM A CITIZEN COMMISSION THAT WOULD REALLY BE LOOKING AT THE TRANS. I JUST NEED TO TO TO MAKE SURE TO CORRECT WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE -- BUT CAL STATE WE HAVE A CAMPUS OF COUSE EXAMINED YOU KNOW IN PALM DESERT THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS THAT ARE THERE. IN TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF A RESOURCES THAT THE COMMUNITIES JUST WANTS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE TO BE ABLE TO TO BEGIN TO TO THE BILL THAT OUT. THEY NEED A PLAN -- AND IT ALSO NEED TO BE PART OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO TO DO THIS WORK AND AGAIN IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY YEAH I JUST NEED TO GO DOWN. AT THE PALM DESERT TO SERVE THE FOLKS IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY THIS NEEDS. TO DO NEEDS BECAUSE STATEWIDE -- WHICH IS WHY I THINK THESE SITES ARE SO IMPORTANT [inaudible] IRAQ. BUT IT'S ONE OF SAY YOU KNOW I YOU ACTUALLY SUPPORT LISTINGS VARIOUS LOCATIONS I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE. AMERICA VALLEY -- SUPPORTS AND I DO TOO WHEN WE HEARD THIS AND IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO CHULA VISTA I WAS ASKING MY COLLEAGUES WHO WAS THE PROPONENT OF THIS. DO YOU NEED TO CAMPUS OR DO NEED TO A BRANCH OF THE CAMPUS AND I THINK THOSE CONVERSATIONS NEED TO OCCUR WITH RESPECT. TO PALM DESERT DO YOU DO WE NEED OF ON HOOVER BRANCH OR DO WE NEED A SEPARATE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. BECAUSE WITH UNIVERSITIES COME THE SAME BUREAUCRACY ISSUES IS FOR A THAT I MENTIONED WITH ONLINE -- DO WE NEED THAT SOMETIMES YOU DO SOMETIMES YOU DON'T BUT I DO SUPPORT. A STUDY I SUPPORT A MASTER PLAN I SUPPORT LOOKING AT THESE VARIOUS LOCATIONS. TO FIND OUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ENTITY IS THAT WE SITE THERE WHETHER IT'S A BRANCH CAMPUS OR WHETHER IT'S A STAND UP STAND ALONE UNIVERSITY JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT IN. AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YOUR POINTS. ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION SEEING NONE. MOVING ON TO THE ISSUE. THIRTY ONE THE NEW THAT RIGHT YEAH ISSUE. THIRTY ONE THIS IS VERY IFFY ISSUE ADJUSTMENTS ELIA. THIS ITEM CONSISTS OF FOUR ISSUES RELATED TO CSU TWO OF THE ISSUES ARE SENATE PRIORITIES TO THE ISSUES ARE ASSEMBLY PRIORITIES. JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THAT ONE HOUSE PROVIDES A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE CAPITAL FELLOWS PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY FELLOWS. AND THE HOUSE ALSO PROVIDES TARGETED ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING FOR A PROGRAM THAT PREPARES SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS TO WORK IN K. TWELVE SCHOOLS IN OTHER SETTINGS. AND WE FIND THAT BOTH OF THESE AUGMENTATIONS HAVE MERIT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT ANY OF THE FOUR ISSUES AND THIS ITEM AB QUESTIONS. FINANCING THE COMMENT. THANK YOU. WITH A STATUS CHECK FOR MY FELLOW. GIVE ME FOR MONEY AB FAB AND WE'VE BEEN WE OWE SOME FORMER DOUBLES. SERVING ALL RIGHT ISSUE THIRTY TWO ACADEMIC QUALITY IN GRADUATION INITIATIVE. SO THIS ITEM CONTAINS ONE YOU SEE ISSUE AND ONE CSU ISSUE REGARDING STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES. THE HOUSE IS DIFFERENT MORE ON THE UC ISSUE WITH THE SENATE ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING WITH A FOCUS ON YOU SEE CLOSING. ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AT CAMPUSES. THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE PROPOSAL IN THE ASSEMBLY ACTION RECOGNIZE UC'S RELATIVELY HIGH GRADUATION RATES AND INSTEAD CHOSE. TO TARGET ONGOING FUNDS FOR OTHERHIGH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES IN PARTICULAR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THE HOUSES ARE MUCH CLOSER ON THE CSU ISSUE BOTH PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR BUT THE SENATE PROVIDES THE FUNDING ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WHILE THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES THE FUNDING ONE TIME. BETWEEN THE HOUSES WE RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY VERSION. PROVIDING THE FUNDING ON A ONE TIME BASIS WOULD LIMIT -- THE STATE'S OUT YOUR SPENDING COMMITMENTS AND STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S RESERVES IN THE EVENT OF A FUTURE RECESSION AND WE WOULD KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS CAMPUSES COULD USE ONE TIME FUNDING. EFFECTIVELY SUCH AS REDESIGNING AT HIRING FACULTY TO OFFER MORE COURSES IN HIGH DEMAND. PROGRAMS IN HIGH DEMAND AREAS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE RIGHT OVER TO MICHAEL GREAT CERTAINLY I THINK ON THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AUGMENTATIONS -- CERTAINLY THEY'RE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR BUDGET I THINK WE'D HAVE A CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF SOME OF THOSE -- INVESTMENTS WE ALSO NOTE -- ON THE REJECTION OF THE STUDENT SUCCESS -- INITIATIVE IT AT YOU SEE -- WE WOULD NOTE THA THERE ARE STILL GAPS IN STUDENT SUCCESS AMONG -- UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS OF STUDENTS LOW INCOME STUDENTS SHOWING THANK WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO CAREFULLY BALANCE STUDENT SUCCESS WITH THE OTHER -- MEASURES THAT THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE TO PUT IN PLACE -- PARTICULARLY ACCESS -- SO WE CERTAINLY AREN'T IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THESE THESE DIFFERENCES TODAY BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A AREFUL BALANCE THE NEEDS TO BE CRAFTED. THANK YOU COMMENTS QUESTIONS. MR MCCARTY YEAH I JUST -- BRIEFLY ON THE ON THE UC ITEM. IT THE TICKET CAME DOWN -- TO PRIORITIES AGAIN AND TOP ISSUE WE HEAR FROM OUR MEMBERS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IS ACCESS TO THE GREAT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HOW THEIR NEIGHBOR OR THEIR NEPHEW THEIR FRIENDS. HAS A FOUR POINT THREE IN A PLAID IRVINE DAVIS IN LA AND GREAT SAT SCORE THEY CAN'T GET IN. AND SO THE THE QUALITY PIECE WAS A REALLY COOKED IN THERE REALLY ISN'T A HUGE. FOR YOUR GRADUATION CRISIS THAT YOU SEE LIKE THERE IS CSU SO WE THOUGHT THE HIGHEST AND BEST SE THAT FIFTY MILLION WAS TO ENROLL. OR CALIFORNIANS THANKS WITH SKINNER. WE ARE HAVING DISCUSSION ON THE ROLE MAKE PEACE SUBSEQUENT CRITICS NAY ITS NECK I THINK SHE THIRD BY WILL SAVE MY COMMENT I APPRECIATE THAT. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON ITEM THIRTY TWO WERE COMMENTS THIRTY THREE LA JOH WELCOME TO YOU FIRST MR. BELIAU. GREAT SO AS NOTED THAT THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU INVOLVES ENROLLMENT. YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PIECES IN THIS ITEM SO I'M I'M GONNA BREAK IT OUT INTO THREE KEY ISSUES FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. THE FIRST ISSUE HERE REPORT PERTAINS TO UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT AT CSU AND YOU SEE. FOR CSU THE SENATE PROVIDED MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH. FOR YOU SEE. THEY BOTH HOUSES PROVIDED MORE MOMENT GROSS THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED WITH THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDING MORE THAN THE SENATE. WITH REGARD TO UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH WE ARE GOING NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE THROUGHOUT THE THE BUDGET PROCESS AS YOU THINK ABOUT ENROLLMENT GROWTH. ON THE ONE HAND -- IF YOU LOOK AT TWO FIFTY FACTORS OF THE LEGISLATURE HISTORICALLY HAS LOOKED AT TO DETERMINE ENROLLMENT LEVELS -- HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE PROJECTED TO DECLINE VERY SLIGHTLY ON THE UPCOMING YEAR. AND BOTH -- SYSTEMS ARE DRAWING FROM BEYOND THEIR TRADITIONAL FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY POOLS. THOSE TWO FACTORS MIGHT SUGGEST THAT YOU COULD GO WITH THE LOWER AMOUNTS BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES. ON THE OTHER HAND BOB STUDENTS AT BOTH SEGMENTS -- ARE MADE MANY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ARE NOT. ACCOMMODATED TO THEIR CAMPUS A CHOICE AND IN A CASE OF YOU SEE ARE REDIRECTED TO CAMPUS IS LIKE YOU SEE MERCED END UP NOT A ROLLING BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE CAMPUS THAT THEY PREFER TO GO. TO PROVIDING MORE ENROLLMENT GROWTH COULD ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THOSE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS AND IF THE FOR THAT WERE HIGH PRIORITY YOU COULD GO WITH THE HIGHER AMOUNTS SO IT'S GOING TO FALL DOWN TO WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE TWO SYSTEMS. AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. REGARDING GRADUATE ENROLLMENT OF THIS CITY THE SECOND ISSUE IS FOR GRADUATE ROLE MEANT THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T PROVIDE FUNDING EXPLICITLY FOR GRADUATE ROMAN GROSS THE ASSEMBLY DID. AND HERE WE WILL KNOW THAT THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF LONG STANDING UP POLICY GUIDELINES DRIVING GRADUATE MOMENT THAT IT DOES UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. ON THE UNIVERSITY HAS. LONG ARGUED THAT IT I WOULD LIKE TO GROW GRADUATE MOMENT IN CONCERT WITH UNDERGRADUATE REAL MEN AND THE OBJECTIVE THERE IS TO IT ADD MORE DISCUSSION SESSIONS AND AND ADD MORE T. A.'S. AYE TO ACCOMMODATE THE SORT OF HIGHER LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH. I'M THE ROUGH RULE OF THUMB THE UNIVERSITY RULES ABOUT FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FOR EVERY GRADUATE STUDENT SO IF YOU WANTED TO KEEP THE PROPORTION ROUGHLY THE SAME AS IT IS IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR. ARE YOU COULD USE THAT ROUGH RULE OF THUMB SO FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE SENATE PROPOSAL OF UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GRADUATE STUDENTS. AND OTHERS UNDER THE I'M SORRY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY UNDER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY UNDER THE SENATE PACKAGE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRADUATE STUDENTS UNDER THE ASSEMBLY PACKAGE EXCUSE ME THERE. AND FINALLY THE THIRD ISSUE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS THE PER STUDENT FUNDING RATE -- THAT YOU SEE BETWEEN THE HOUSES THE HOUSE IS DIFFERENT HERE WITH THE SENATE PROVIDING A LOWER RATE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT IN THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDING A HIGHER RATE ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AFFECTED LEE THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT THE SENATE OF FOCUSES ON UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES GROWTH FOR BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE ENROLLMENT UNDERGRADUATE MOMENT LIKELY. IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN GRADUATE ENROLLMENT AND SO THAT IS THAT THE FACTOR BEHIND THE TWO DIFFERENT RATES THERE WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE THAT IF YOU JUST FOCUS ON UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS YOU COULD GO WITH A A SENATE RATE. IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE GROWTH FOR BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE ROLE THAT YOU COULD GO WITH THE ASSEMBLY RATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE FINANCE. TO CERTAINLY ON NEITHER OF THESE TWO AUGMENTATIONS FOR ENROLLMENT IN TWO YEARS YOU ARE YOU SEE -- THAT BOTH HOUSES HAVE CONSIDERED -- WERE INCLUDED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET WHAT WE WOULD SAY AND I THINK I ALLUDED TO THIS MY PREVIOUS COMMENT IS WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BALANCE THE STUDENT SUCCESS ASPECTS WITH. ENROLLMENT AND ACCESS FUNDING AS WELL AND WE LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF ON THAT BALANCE. THANK YOU MISS SKINNER. THANK YOU ARMS. I WANTED TO ECHO -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY SCUM IT'S ON THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION. WE ARE -- WHILE I FEEL THAT WE COULD EVEN EXPAND CSU'S ENROLLMENT IN TERMS OF THE DEMAND IN THE NEED ACROSS OUR STATE. WE HAVE AS A LEGISLATURE DONE BETTER IN TERMS OF FINDING CSU TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT CALF E COMPARE AS COMPARED TO THE UC SYSTEM. AND I WILL NOTE THAT -- FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FALL. THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICANTS HUNDRED THOUSAND TO UCLA OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND TO UC BERKELEY I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD TO THE OTHER% INSTITUTIONS. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN THE FRESHMAN CLASS OF EACH OF THOSE UC'S WAS IN THE ORDER OF SIXTY THREE HUNDRED SO SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS GUARDIAN HAVE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICANTS. NOW OF THAT HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICANTS THEY WERE NOT ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS NO BUT I WOULD. AND I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS AND DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME BUT I CAN PRETTY MUCH VENTURE TO SAY THERE WAS AT LEAST FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM AT LEAST HALF WERE. SO WE KNOW THAT THE DESIRE BY OUR FAMILIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE FULFILL OUR MASTER PLAN PROMISE. IS REALLY GREAT IN OUR POPULATION HAS EXPANDED SIGNIFICANTLY AND ONLY CAMPUS WE HAVE ADDED SINCE I WENT TO COLLEGE AND I'M NOT GONNA SAY HOW OLD I AM. YEARS AGO YEAH JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- IS MERCED. AND NUMBER SAID IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE UC CAMPUSES THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT. THAT -- IT. IS IN FACT UNDER ENROLLED -- AND MAYBE IT'S NOT IN THIS MAYBE THIS YEAR IT WASN'T BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE. MERCED GROWING AND FOR MORE PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE THAT IT REALLY IS AN EXCELLENT INSTITUTION. BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY DO OUR BEST TO FIND INCREASE ENROLLMENT THAT ARE YOU SEE SYSTEM IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO. FOR THESE -- FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND I JUST ECHO -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY SEE CONCERNS. I CERTAINLY DORSEN SUPPORT THE UC ENROLLMENT. BUT NOT AT THE EXCLUSION OF CSU BOTH. UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS BENEFIT. BY BEING ABLE TO MEET. THE REQUIREMENTS OR THE HOAX IF YOU WILL OF THE MASTER PLAN OF HIGHER EDUCATION. MOSTLY IT WOULD BE OUR STUDENTS THE DESERVE. THE HOPE IN THE PROMISE AND THE REALIZATION OF THAT SO AS WE BALANCES OUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD ATTEND TO GROWTH IN CENTER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH SEE ISSUE AND UC. CETERA [inaudible] BINGO. I THINK WE'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB THE BY YOU SEE ISSUE THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET I THINK -- AS WE TALK ABOUT IT IN AS I LOOK AT IT WE MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SHORT ON UC'S SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONTINUED CONVERSATION WITH MIKE. COLLEAGUES FROM THE ASSEMBLY ON HOW WE CAN -- HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THAT -- IN THE FINAL PRODUCT THAT WE WORK ON HERE THANK YOU. FOR THE QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT LEAVE THAT ITEM OPEN CALLING FOR THE OUR OF FIVE O'CLOCK HAVING ARRIVED. I'M GOING -- TO THE GERMAN FOR THE EVENING -- WE ALL HAVE -- BRIEFING [inaudible] IF.
