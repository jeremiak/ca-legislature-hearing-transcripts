SUPREME COURT DECIDED THAT THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT THEY HAD SEEN ON THE CLASSIFICATION. ALONG AND IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CREATE A TASK THAT WAS MUCH MORE SIMPLE FOR ME SUPPORT WORKERS TO UNDERSTAND THE LAW. THANK IT UNFAIR THAT THE BRELO TEST WHICH IS AN ELEVEN POINT TEST. WHAT HE'S FAT. THE WORKER REALLY DETERMINED A PACIFICATION UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY FILED A LAWSUIT. WITH THEY SAID IT'S CLEAR THERE'S AN A. B. C. TO MAKE IT EASY AND THEY PROVIDED NO EXEMPTIONS BUT A LOT OF RATIONALE. THERE WAS A LOT FALLOUT FROM THAT DECISION WE STARTED HEARING FROM BUSINESSES WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY WERE LEGITIMATE USING LEGITIMATE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR HAVING A BUSINESS TO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. BUT WE'RE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN SESSION OR WOULD BE SEPARATE TOOL LAWSUIT BECAUSE THAT DECISION. WE STARTED HEARING FROM WRITER WHO HAD LOST JOBS FROM OUT OF STATE BECAUSE SESSION. NEW THAT I THERE WERE THOSE OF US WHO REALLY WANTED TO PROTECT. THE WORKERS THAT WERE PROTECTED NOT DECISION IN AT THE SAME TIME MAKE THE CLARIFICATIONS NECESSARY. BUT IT WORKED FOR AS MANY LEGITIMATE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND SMALL BUSINESSES AS POSSIBLE YET PRESERVING THE FACT THAT. MS CLASSIFICATION BECOME A HUGE ISSUE. WE PASSED MAYBE FIVE LAST YEAR AND A- SOON AS IT WAS FINE WE STARTED HEARING FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO FELT LIKE THAT THEY WERE CAUGHT UP IN THE LANGUAGE. WE ALSO HEARD FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO WE KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES FOR WE HAD SETBACK AS IT WENT FORWARD. SO HERE WE ARE WITH ATP WHICH IS THE BILL TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR INDIVIDUALS IN INDIVIDUAL AREAS- THAT REALLY DID GET CAUGHT UP. I INTRODUCED IN JANUARY TWO CAN WORK WE STARTED TO PROTECT WORKERS RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES AND TAXPAYERS AGAINST THIS CLASSIFICATION. AND AS WE FIND OURSELVES A MIST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THE NEED FOR A BI FIVE THE IMPETUS FOR DYNAMAX DECISION COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR. MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYERS TO MASK THEIR WORKERS HOLDS THE SOCIAL CONTRACT ENTERED INTO BY EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEE IN THE STATE.

WHICH IS FOR THE COUNTRY THE FAT INSOLVENCY AND LET OUR STATE TO BECOME THE FIRST TO BORROW FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS OUR DEFICIT- WHO WERE AROUND DURING THE LAST LOAN KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN TWO YEARS WHEN THAT LOAN BE. ILL BUSINESS ONE FACTOR. MEET OUT THOSE WHO HAVE PAID INTO OUR SYSTEM ARE COSTING US UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER ESTIMATED THAT IF RIGHT SURE COMPANIES LIKE UBER LEFT HAD PAID INTO THEIR FAIR SHARE INTO YOU I FUND THEY WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND MILLION. FOR THE WORKERS AS FIVE YEARS AND WE WOULD HAVE TO A LOAN THE NATIONAL WHAT PRICE NASH HIS THAT'S MADE THAT THE UNDUE BURDEN ON LAW ABIDING IS INFORMED INCREASED. IN ITS. EIGHT HUNDRED. THAT GETS BORN BY LAW ABIDING COMPANIES. IT'S UNFAIR AND IT NEEDED TO BE CHANGED. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB FIVE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLY WOMAN. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH AB FIVE AGAIN AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THE FOR A LITTLE WHILE- AS WE WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE EXEMPTIONS BUT- I DO WANT TO DRESS. I LOOKED A LITTLE INTERESTING THEN. LOT OF BILLS THAT DEALT WITH AB FIVE I THINK FIFTEEN TO BE EXACT THAT WERE NOT SET THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE- ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AISLE BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR I BRING IT UP BECAUSE- ABOUT IT TODAY. INTERPRETERS WITH TRANCE. IT WAS AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY NINE VOTE THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE SITE AS FOR MY PERSPECTIVE. MOVE FOR WITH DEALING WITH. WHAT IS THE WAY TO WORK WITH YOU THIRTY FIVE. THE LABOR COMMITTEE- AS A WHOLE TO TRY TO YES SOME OF THESE. NEW ONES BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN SUCKED INTO AB FIVE THAT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU ARE KNOWINGLY OR WHAT WANTING TO HURT RIGHT TIME I TRUST THAT. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF JUST. BUSINESSES THE GET PULLED THAT WE KIND OF SUCKED INTO THIS VORTEX THAT IS AB FIVE AND WE NEED TO NOT WORK THROUGH THAT AND YOU STATED THAT A NUMBER OF TIMES LIKE WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THIS THERE IS GOING TO BE FIXES BUT IT TURNED A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE SIGNIFICANT. AMOUNT OF. BILLS THAT DEALT WITH EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE IMPORTANT. TO OUR DISTRICTS. THAT ART CONSTITUENTS ASKED US. TO WORK WITH. INCLUDING ONE ADULT WITH INTERPRETERS AND TRANSLATORS. SO I GUESS MIGHT WITH MORE OF A STATEMENT AN ENGINE LINE WE WOULD MEAN TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. THAT WHETHER IT BE THE AYE COMMUNITY. WHETHER IT BE INTERPRETERS THE QUITE FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT WAS NOT MY INDUSTRY BUT I'D VERY SYMPATHETIC AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL HERE TODAY. WORK THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THAT COME TO YOU WITH THESE IDEAS FIRST. AND FOR WHAT LENDS ARE WE PICKING AND I AND I KNOW THE TERM WINNERS AND LOSERS HAS COME UP A LOT AND I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT HARSH TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO. PICK IN WHAT YOU IN THE BUSINESS. AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THESE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN SUCKED INTO A LAMP TURNED THAT WITH OPENING UP. OUR BIT IN THE FOR LIVING. ALONE AT THE END DO NOT LEGISLATION SO I GUESS THAT'S MY CAN IN JUST DEAL WITH NOT. SO I WILL. SAY TO YOU WHAT I HAVE SAID AND I CAN PEOPLE ON EVEN REPUBLICANS ON THIS COMMITTEE HAVE COME TO MY OFFICE MULTIPLE TIMES WITH THESE ISSUES OUT OF THE YOU KNOW WORK WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS. ANYONE WHO HAS COME. EXT IT. SHOWS. I'VE BEEN VERY. ABOUT HOW WE LOOK AT ALL THESE BEST SO WHEN YOU SAY WINNERS AND LOSERS SOMETIMES IT FOR PICK EIGHTEEN IF YOU CUT CONSIDER BUSINESS THE WINNER. THEN THE WORKERS ARE LOSERS. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW PROCESS INTERPRETERS AND TRANSLATORS HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHY. WE DO THIS LATER- THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO THE BILL NOW. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CERTIFICATION WE HAVE THE DYNAMICS DECISION THAT LAYS OUT CLEARLY THE TYPES OF THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK AT TO AVOID EXPLOITATION. WE LOOK AT THROUGH THAT IS. I'LL BUT DO WHEN THINGS WE IS WE CHECK WITH THE D. ON PASS MISS CLASS. FOR THOU ONE AND A LOT AND IN OTHERS HAVE BEEN ON DEEMED MISCLASSIFIED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND- TEN PEOPLE. THE VISUALS. TO THE EIGHTY PART. IN AT. RIGHT BRELO. INTO ONE OF THE FACTORS WE LOOK AT IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY UP YOUR YOUR ALL ALL. YOU'RE STILL UNDER BURKE INSIDE YOU STILL HAVE GO THROUGH ALL THE- OR DO WE LOOK AT AND SAY. OKAY HOUSING THAT'S WHAT WHAT'S CAUSING THIS COMP FOR SOME IN WANT TO BE IN A CONTRACTOR SOME DO. WHY ARE SOME COMPANIES REQUIRED TO MEET THEM EMPLOYEES BY EDIE AN AUDIT AND OTHERS ARE NOT DOING THAT. LEADERS WHICH DO WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION. FINEST CLASSIFICATIONS IT'S AGAIN SO WE WERE TRYING TO PUT IT INTO THE BILL. NOW WE WANTED A CERTIFICATION THAT IF IT THE OTHER THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW IF YOUR TRANSLATOR WHAT MAKES THAT. HI XIN. IN SOME TRAP. ASKED US FOR THAT WELL THEN WE FIND OUT THAT THE SAID THERE IS NO CERTIFICATION EXCEPT BY ONE. AND IT'S ONLY FOR SPANISH IN SO WE'RE LEAVING OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WE AT ME TO LEAVE OUT. CREATE ANOTHER. WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO. JUST BECAUSE- THEY SPEAKING LANGUAGE IN IN SO THE BARRIER TO ENTRY BECOMES VERY LOW ESPECIALLY IN A STATE LIKE HELP WE HAVE A LOT OF MULTI LINGUAL PEOPLE ININ IN SO IT'S RIGHT FOR ITS WHAT YOU WERE WORK TRANSLATE THAT'S IT THERE'S CONTROL YOU DO. THOSE THINGS RIGHT INTO. OUR SOLE. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE STATE. TRUE TO THE DYNAMICS RULING AND WE HAVE DONE THAT I APPRECIATE PEOPLE SAY THE WINNERS AND LOSERS AND RANDOM EXEMPTIONS AND THAT THAT TO ME I GOT IT IF YOU HAVEN'T SPENT I GUESS LAST THREE YEARS LOOKING AT CASE. THAT ALL ALL. ASIAN LOOKING AT EIGHT SEEMS MATH CLASS OKAY SUITS AND BRAWL OF. ASKING TO ALL OF THESE WORK THAN IT DOES LOOK LIKE AND I'M THERE WAS NO RAN ABOUT THE THING SELECTED WE HAVE BEEN. SYSTEMATICALLY GOING THROUGH THEM AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WITH INTERPRETERS WERE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN INTERPRETER'S WORK UNDER PEARL AGENCY. OR REFERRAL AGENCY AND NOT A BROKER. OF RECORD THAT SEEMS TO BE THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT HOW MUCH LEVEL. YOU TO DO YOUR WORK. WE AN INDEPENDENT YOUR OWN SMALL. AND I WANNA REMIND PEOPLE ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID IN THIS BILL IS WE TOOK THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS EXEMPTION PUT IT AT THE TOP COULD BECAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST THING PEOPLE SHOULD ACT AND THAT IS VERY. YOU CAN BE A SOUL ARE YOU AND- HE HE AT. AT AND YOU CAN BE AND IF YOU BUY THOSE TERMS WERE YOU ARE ACTING AS- A LOT. TRAIN RIGHT NOW. SOME INTERPRETERS. HUNDRED CONDITIONS. THE FIRST THING THAT YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN NEED AN EXEMPTION. BUT WITH WITH C. INTERPRETERS WERE CONTINUING TO TRY TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IS OUR STANDARD IS THERE THE CERTIFIED INTERPRETERS IS THAT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT ABILITY AND- COMMUNITY I CAN DEAL. I THINK WE USE LOT OF INTER MEANS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE THAT OF INTERPRETERS WHO WORKS NOT ONLY IS INTERPRETERS BUT THEY'RE ALSO OUT. IN OTHER INTERPRETER. A HIERARCHY SO IF YOU GET TO ENTER THE HOT TEA THE LAST AND TIRED YOU KNOW. BROKER AND HIRED YOUR FIRST THEY'RE GETTING VERY LITTLE MY FOR WHAT. AND THOSE THE INTERPRETER CAME TO ME IN PLEASE EXEMPTS INTERPRET. SO IT'S A BALANCE AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THERE WE'RE GOING TO THERE SOME. SUGGEST SOMEBODY WHO'S HEARD FROM THIS ENTRY. ONE OF THEM XIN YOU KNOW. I DID KIND OF FIND OUT AND BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN WORK LISTEN I KNOW HOW TO READ CAN I KNOW. A LOOK THAT'S RIDICULOUS SOME PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T GET EXEMPTION VERY GOOD LOBBYIST SOME PEOPLE WHO GOT EXEMPTION FOR HAD NO LOBBYIST YOU KNOW WE ACTUALLY TRIED. YOUR IN WERE CONTINUE. BY LOOKING TO KATE ARE LOOKING HAS PER. IN AN A- AND- YOU KNOW MISS CLARK. HELLO A WORKER SHOULD NOW HAVE TO GO THROUGH HOOPS AND HOPES HOOPS TO CLASSIFICATION WE THEY'RE CLEARLY CLASSIFY. THAT WHAT THIS BILL IS SUPPOSED DO AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE ARE TRULY THERE OWN BUSINESS WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF ME TO CONTINUE WORK. THERE'S A PARTICULAR ISSUE ANY MEMBER EVEN. YEAH AS I'VE NEVER DENY FOR A MEETING NUMBER OF AND SOME YOU KNOW WE AS WELL AS THEM HAVE COME IN BEEN A LOT OF TIME WITH ME ON THESE SO I WELCOME YOU I WILL ANYONEHAS THESE AND I JUST ASK YOU YOU WALK THROUGH THE DESIGN PORT WITH ME I ASK THAT YOU. IS SEEN L. A. THAT'S WHAT. RELEASE THIS WORK OUT THERE FOR LOSERS WHEN PRESSED TO MAKE THEM I APPRECIATE THAT AND I YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS YOU CAN'T ON A YOUR YOU YOU MADE A STATEMENT THAT YOU GOING THROUGH THE SYSTEM. OF WHAT IS THAT SYSTEMATIC APPROACH THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT AND BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WHILE WHILE WE'RE DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES THERE MAY BE INDUSTRIES OUT HERE THAT ARE JUST LEFT OUT HERE FIGHTING SHORT DOT. THE WHAT WE WANT TO BE. NOT ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH ME. ASIAN AND I AM. BILL TODAY- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GO THROUGH EIGHTY FIVE AS YOU KNOW PUTTING THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN UNDER YOU KNOW NOT WORTH PROTECTING EMPLOYEES AS WELL SO ANYWAYS CHAIR CHURCH. IS FOR AN ABBREVIATED KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WATCHING US THEY DON'T AND- THE RATIONALE THAT THEY USE. ABOUT THE INTO A FIELD SO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW DO YOU NEED A SPECIALIZED DEGREE DO WE NEED A SPECIALIZED CERTIFICATION BECAUSE WHEN YOU ADD THOSE UP ON TOP OF. I'M JUST BEING A VIGIL YOUR LETTER LIKELY POINTED BECAUSE- IT'S HARD TO GET INTO FOR EXAMPLE DOCTORS LAWYERS EVERY SAID WELL WHY DID YOU EXAMPLE I'M- WELL. IT'S STORE NO YOU CAN'T. SO WE- NEGOTIATE FOR THEM CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN- ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE DOWN TO THEIR OWN WORK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE WAS IN PART BE HELLO HOW ALL OF JOB YOUR- RIDLEY THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. WE WILL HAVE ORDERS RIGHT TO THEIR EXISTING WHICH IS THAT HAVE EXEMPTIONS FOR FOLKS THAT'S HOW WE GOT MORE. THAN I MEAN WHERE WOULD I COME UP WITH COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN IT'S BEEN A LOT FOR YOU KNOW SINCE YEARS AT THE ORDER. ALL OF THE FIRST TO SAY WHAT ARE GONE AND WHAT. SIR THIS DAY IN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THERE'S A THAT WE TRIED TO LINE UP THE BILL WITH AND THEN WE WENT THROUGH PASSED CLASS OF KITCHEN PEOPLE HISTORICALLY BEEN EMPLOYED AND THE BILL NOW JUST MAKING THEM INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN LIEU RIGHT KIND OF FOR. AS WE- ALL THRILLED. MOST FOLKS YOU CAN KIND OF WHEN YOU GO THROUGH HE GETS RIGHT LIKE THAT'S WHY I SAID WE I WHEN I TOLD LAST NIGHT LIKE HATE I INSIST ON MAKE SPLIT CATION FOR TRANSLATORS. OKAY THAT'S- RIGHT BECAUSE WE WANT TO TRY TO GET TRANSLATOR TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY THE ABILITY DO THAT BUT CERTAINLY TELL ME THERE'S NO BARRIER TO ENTRY BUT IS THAT BERRIER THEN CAN ANY. TRANSLATOR BECAUSE OF. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LATE WELL THAT'S EXTREMELY LARGE AND THAT'S- VULNERABLE TEXT TATIAN IT. SO I WORK. I'M TRYING I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO LOSE MONEY I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO LOSE THEIR WAGES- I DON'T WANT TO MESS UP ANYBODY'S. BUSINESS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO INSURE. FOR THAT. YOUR DECISION. YOU KNOW THAT MISTER OF. CAN YOU IT TOOK A LOT TIME TO GET TO MUSIC AT WHAT'S ONE OF THESE THAT THAT TOOK THE UNIONS THE INDEPENDENT ARTISTS THE- RECORD INDUSTRY IN WAS A LOT BUT WERE COMMITTED TO WE NOW WORK I THINK PICKING EXEMPTION AND JUST THROWING AMOUNT IS NOT THE WAY TELL A WE TO ON. WE AS WE HAVE AND I JUST WANT THAT BECAUSE- OF HER AND AN JOURNAL SAID YOU KNOW THEY HAVE AS A LAWSUIT. WITH LAWSUIT THROWN OUT BY THE COURTS AS- LAWSUIT. CHALLENGE THE FIVE EIGHT RECORDS WITH THE PROGRAM SUIT YEAH IN SO THAT'S WHY ON A P. YOU'RE THE ONE. BECAUSE THE JUDGE. I'M SAYS. DIRECTLY LATER PROHIBITS THAT REGULATES THE IN READ IN IT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION US CONSTITUTION SO. BUT WE WANT TO NOT BE RANDOM AND GIVE RANDOM EXEMPTIONS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE OFFENSIVE REPEAT THE INTERVIEW SOME BILLS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS THE QUOTE. THAT OUR SYSTEM THE EIGHT SEIZE THOSE AND THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY TO. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SOME MADONNA. YEAH THANK YOU.

AB THIRTY FIFTY SIX WOULD CREATE WORKPLACE SAFETY IMPAIR PAY STANDARDS FOR WORKERS WHO OPERATE UNDER A QUOTA SYSTEM WHILE WORKING IN WAREHOUSES YES WE'RE TALKING PRIMARILY ABOUT AMAZON WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN MODERN HOUSES COMPANIES THAT SPECIFIC QUOTAS FOR WORKERS TO MEET SUCH AS HOW MANY ITEMS PER HOUR THEY SHOULD PULL IN PACKAGE FOR MORE THAN THE MONITOR THE PRODUCT WAS HOW MUCH TIME OFF TASK OCCURS INCLUDING THE TIME IT TAKES. TO USE THE RIGHT. WARNINGS CAN BE EVEN BEING INVOLVED IN ONE WAREHOUSE FACILITY IN RIVERSIDE EMPLOYEES HOW TO WALK FOR SEVEN MINUTES TO THE NEAREST RESTROOM LEADING TO ME MANY TO SKIP BATHROOM BREAKS RATHER THAN FACE PENALTIES FOR TIME OP TASK AND SUB POINT A **** I WILL REMIND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR WOMEN SOMETIMES IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO SWITCH. A BATHROOM BREAK THESE QUOTAS CAN ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME FORCING WORKERS TO ADAPT IN WORK FASTER TO MEET A HIGHER QUOTA RATHER THAN WORKING LONGER IN HAVING TO PAY OVERTIME DURING A CUT CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS MANY VETS HAVE BECOME EVEN MORE RELIANT ON WAREHOUSES AS WE ORDER ITEMS ONLINE TO BE DELIVERED TO OUR DOOR WHILE THE CENTRAL WAREHOUSE WORKERS CONTINUE TO TRY TO MAKE STRICT AS COVER WORKERS REPORT STERN IS ALLOTTED FOR FREQUENT HAND WASHING TO REDUCE POTENTIAL TRANSMISSION THE CORONA VIRUS OR TO STAND. EQUIPMENT AND WHAT STATIONS AND WE'RE BACK TO WORK LAWPERIODS PEAK CHEFS. SEASON SUCH AS A HOLIDAY ARE THE CURRENT PANDA. ACTUAL SENT TO AM WORKER DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HAVE ASKED THEM TO WORK MANDATORY EXTRA TIME OR FACE A SEPARATION OF EMPLOYMENT. WAREHOUSE WORKERS ARE SENT ON THE COURSE OF EVERYDAY LIFE AND EVEN MORE SO DURING THE CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. HOWEVER THESE WORKERS ARE SUBJECT TO WORK STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS WHICH DO NOT RESPECT THEIR BASIC HUMAN DIGNITY CLEAN. TASTE NEEDS- PROPER HYGIENE OR PROPERLY COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE BACK BREAKING WORK THAT THEY ARE PERFORMING. AB THIRTY FIFTY SIX WOULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES FACED BY WAREHOUSE WORKERS. BY PROHIBITING READ. TO PROHIBIT REASONABLE AMOUNTS OF TIME SPENT FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AS COUNTY TOWARDS TIME REQUIRED FOR WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEE TO COMPLETE QUOTA. THESE INCLUDE ASSESSING IN USING A RESTROOM HYDRATION OR HAND WASHING STATION. DOCUMENTING OR REPORTING A LABOR CODE VIOLATION. THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T SAY SO BUT WE DON'T MEAN GOING TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WE WILL CLARIFY. OUT DOCUMENTATION. LEGALLY THE BILL WOULD ALSO THE WORK WEEK TO PUT AN EX OF AN ESTABLISHED QUOTA BE COMPENSATED AT ONE AND A HALF TIMES EMPLOYEES REGULAR PAY AND ESTABLISH CIVIL PENALTIES EMPLOYERS WHO VIOLATE THESE PROVISIONS I WILL POINT OUT CURRENTLY WE HAVE NO- Y. DEFINITIONAL QUARTER THE QUOTA IS SET BY THE EMPLOYER AND WE ARE CHANGING THIS IT'S JUST SAYING IF IT IT. BACK TO BEYOND THE- EIGHT. IN OR- OVER TIME PAYMENT THEY'RE STILL GONNA TO PAY OVERTIME PREMIUM PAY- FOR WORKING. EVEN QUICKER AND- WITHOUT BREAKS SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY AYE BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WITNESS AND THEN.

THE SAY THAT FROM A FROM A PERSONAL. WHEN IT WHEN I WAS IN IN COLLEGE MY MISSPENT YOUTH WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN I WAS WHAT THEY CALLED A SWAMPER. SWAPPERS SOMEONE THAT TAKES ITEMS OFF A TRUCK. PUT HIM INTO A WAREHOUSE THE DIN BE DISTRIBUTED OUT. OF I LASTED ABOUT SIX MONTHS. IN THAT WAREHOUSE. THERE WAS. OBVIOUSLY NO UNION BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A UNION OF INTERNATIONAL SWAPPERS OUT THERE- I NEVER KNEW WHEN MY BRAKES WERE. YOUR PEOPLE GOT HURTS THERE WERE NO WORKERS COMP. TO THIS DAY I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY SO SECURITY TAKEN OUT I WAS PAID CASH. IT WAS AN OVERTIME. OVER TIME MEANT IF I GOT TO READ THREE AND LEFT AT THREE IN THE MORNING I GOT PAID THAT SAME TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR ALL THE WAY THROUGH THERE WAS THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT TIME IN HALF IF YOU ASKED ABOUT IT- YOU YOU WOULD DEFINITELY GOING WELL. BUT WHAT ULTIMATELY ENDED MY FROM MY AFFILIATION WITH THIS GROUP. WAS WITH A GENTLEMAN NAMED BRUCE WHO IS OUR SUPERVISOR. WHO CAME UP TO ME AND RESTED THE WORKERS I AFTER AMERICAN OR MEXICAN AMERICAN- SOME. YOU COULD SPEAK ENGLISH. AND HE CAME UP TO A GROUP OF US ABOUT TO UNLOAD A TRUCK. AND HE SAID REGGIE HAVE YOU EVER GONE CAN SHOOTING. AS TO NOT YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA GO CAN SHOOTING MAKE ME WE GO SHOOT SOME MEXICANS AN AFRICANA. AND SO. I JUST KIND OF STARED AT HIM. THE FEW WHO KIND UNDERSTOOD KIND OF LAUGHED AND I TOLD HIM IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE BEING THAT HE SAID. HE LEFT THE NEXT DAY MY HOURS FOR CUT IN HALF THE DAY AFTER THAT THEY WERE CUT TO ZERO THE THIRD DAY HE GAVE ME MY CHECK TELL ME I WASN'T ORGAN PLOY THEIR- WHAT IT'S- ME AS A YOUNG PERSON. EIGHTEEN WE NEED TO HAVE SOME GUIDELINES. END UP THOSE PLACES. WHERE A LOT OF US DON'T WATCH DON'T KNOW DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON- YES THIS THIS MAY GO TO MAYBE THE BETTER RUN PLACES BUT THERE SOME WAREHOUSES. THAT REALLY DO IN A SMALLER BUSINESS ARE IN THERE ARE HIRING PEOPLE FROM MY DISTRICT ARE IMMIGRANT THAT NEED. SOMETHING SPELLED OUT ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH SO THEY KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AT EIGHTEEN WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO THEM THE TOP CRUCIATE YOU. COMING TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT NOBODY. FEW PEOPLE EVER REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN A WAREHOUSE ARENA AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THOSE JOBS IT'S NOT ONLY SAFER BUT MAKING SURE THAT THE WORKPLACE IS A PLACE YOU CAN YOU CAN BE AND YOU YOU UNDERSTAND YEAH HAVE BREAKS. UP OUT OF THE UNITED DOES THE WHOLE OKAY- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE PAIN INTO THE SO SECURITY PAINTED TO THE WORKERS. AND THERE PAIN INTO ON A INSURANCE SO THAT SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN THERE'S- THESE MECHANISM THAT WE SET UP OUR ACTUALLY PUT IN PLACE AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE THINK OF JUST EVEN OVERTIME ON BEING ABLE. TO GET THAT WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO FIGHT FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY IN THE LABOR CODE IS ALREADY THERE- I APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THE EFFORT REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE. ALL THE OPPOSITION TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THANK YOU THURMOND. YES ON IT I WANT TO THANK YOU OTHER IS WELL AS COMMENTS FROM DECEMBER JONES SAWYER- THAT AND I THINK THIS ISSUE AND HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IN A REAL MANNER IS LONG OVERDUE- AND I KNOW EVEN BEFORE THIS CRISIS WAS LONG OVERDUE CRISIS. EXPLODING SOMETIMES WITH THOSE WHO WE DEEM IS ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE REALLY TREAT A SACRIFICIAL WORKERS. AND ARE GIVEN THE PRINT THE PROTECTIONS AND SUPPORT THEY NEED- WE HAD A PRODUCTIVE LABOR COMMITTEE INFO HEARING EARLIER THIS YEAR IN THE IN THE EMPIRE. GUARDING WAREHOUSE WORKERS NOT AS GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LA LABOR OFFENSE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE TO THE AUTHOR. TO BRING THIS BILL FOR I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY TIMELY. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT- YOU TO DO TO PROTECT. WORKERS THAT ALLOW US TO STAY AT HOME. AND ALLOW THEM. TO DO IN THE COMFORT OF HOME THEY ARE ONLY IS. WE TO PROTECT THESE WERE TO BASS BROKEN WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS- SOME. IT I. JUST TO BE SURE SWAPPERS ARE A SUBDIVISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS FLORA AND THEY HAVE TO. OFFICIALLY CALL THEM THAT BUT IT IS TO START WORK. JUST IN CASE. SEVEN YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE HEARING MORE AND MORE ABOUT WAREHOUSE WORKERS AND DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE'RE HEARING ABOUT DEATH OF WORK WAREHOUSE WORKERS BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY'RE WORKING AT SOME THOSE CONDITIONS DO NOT GIVE RISE TO THE BILL EIGHTY TO- PERFORM BASIC HYGIENIC FUNCTIONS WHEN YOU ARE BEING CLOCKED- BY. AT NOT EVEN A PERSON YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE BEING TIME TO HEAR YOUR YOU HAVE A QUOTA AND YOU YOU HAVE TO GO AND GO IN AND YOU CANNOT EVEN TAKE A TO USE THE RESTROOM OR WASH HANDS WITHOUT THAT THIRTEEN YOUR CALL AND THAT TOO IN LAW INTO THE FIRE. IS NOT. WE SHOULD BE TALKING ON THE CENTURY. THIS IS ALTHOUGH NOW IT'S AN AN AOP OR A- TECHNOLOGICAL WAY OF DETERMINING HOW FAST SOMEBODY GOING IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSEMBLY LINE. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE WORKERS HAVE SOME BASIC LEVEL OF PROTECTION. IF YOU HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM. IF YOU HAVE TO WASH OR SHOULD WASH YOUR HANDS IF YOU HAVE TO DOCUMENT A LABOR DEFICIENCY MAYBE SOME OF THESE DEATHS ONE OF OCCURRED. AND SO I THINK IT'S MORE THAN EVER TO ENSURE THAT. AS EMPLOYERS CHANGE THEIR MODELS AND THESE QUOTAS GETS BAD UP IN ORDER TO AVOID OVER TIME. THEY GET SPIT UP AT DIFFERENT TIMES SO YOU'RE ALREADY GOING VERY FAST PACE AND THEN YOU'RE EXPECTED GO EVEN FASTER SO THAT YOU DON'T REACH THE OVERTIME MARK. THAT'S JUST UNREASONABLE A AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE INDIVIDUAL THESE ARE PEOPLE THESE ARE SOLD THESE AREN'T ROBOTS- AND SO IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT WAREHOUSE WORKERS AND I'M GLAD AT AND I'VE HEARD INDIVIDUALLY FROM SO MAYBE YOU HAD. DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES EITHER FROM YOUR STAFF FOR FANS OR PEOPLE IN- I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON THIS DROUGHT THIS YEAR AND TRY TO. GET SOMETHING FOR THIS NEW ECONOMY IN THIS NEW REALITY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MY PHONE HAD A TEXT MESSAGE FROM YOU SO I RAN DOWN THE HALL. TO GET HERE. AND AS THE CHILDREN TO GET SOME EXERCISE ANYWAY BUT- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I LIKE TO START BY THANKING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR EXCEPTIONAL EXCEPTIONAL LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE TO MY OFFICE ON THE BILL WITH. A SHORT FRAME URGENCY AROUND IT I ALSO TO EXTEND A SPECIAL THANKS TO. MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA. BOTH OF WHOM ARE JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS BILL. A FULL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL TWO ZERO FOUR THREE. WHICH ADDRESSES THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH OF OUR STATE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. AS WE GET THROUGH THIS COVER NINETEEN HEALTH CRISIS NOW EVERY DAY A FARMER ACROSS OUR STATE RISE EARLY. THEY LEAVE BEHIND THE FAMILIES- TO PACK INTO CROWDED BUSES. THEY WORK SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN THE FIELD. THEIR DAYS THE LONG WAY. THE WORK IS HARD IT BREAKS DOWN YOUR BODY OVER TIME. MY GRANDFATHER WHO REYES MADE THROUGH THE FARMWORKERS. THE PHARMACY TIRE LIFE AND I SAW HOW TIRELESSLY HE WORKED. HE DID HIS WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT. I AND HE DID IT FOR NOT MUCH MONEY MANY FARMWORKERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED THEY LIVE THEY THEY'RE THEY THEY ARE THEY LACK ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE. THAT THAT A LOT OF US FOR GRANTED CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE COMMON AND VIRUSES VIRUSES CAN SPREAD QUICKLY. YOU SEE IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE FARMWORKERS WORK. IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. THAT THEY HANDLE THE SAME TOOLS AND THE- A QUICK. BUT THAT THEY LIVE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. AND THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THE MANY WITH THE LOW WAGES THAT MOST FARMWORKERS EARNED MEANS THAT MANY MANY FARMWORKERS LIVE IN VERY ARE THE CONDITIONS SEVERAL FAMILIES TO ONE APARTMENT OR SMALL HOUSE. OF SOME IT'S SIX. TO KEEP THEM SET. THEM ISOLATED IN SEPARATE. AS LONG AS THIS PANDEMIC CONTINUES OUR FARMWORKERS ARE AT RISK AND LIKE OUR ELDERLY POPULATION LIKE ARE HOMELESS POPULATION FARMWORKERS ARE VULNERABLE THEN I IN I BELIEVE WE HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY MORAL DUTY TO PROTECT VULNERABLE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE TO FARM AGRICULTURE WORKERS- WE YOU KNOW. IT SURE THAT WE PROTECT THEM IS AN URGENT URGENT MATTER. YOU KNOW A COVERT NINETY OUTBREAK IN THE FARM WORKER. THE COMMUNITY WITH THREATEN OUR FOOD SUPPLY WE NEED OUR FARMWORKERS TO STAY HEALTHY SO THEY CAN STATE JOB ARE FARMWORKERS KEEP FOOD ON OUR TABLES AND THEY KEEP OUR GROCERY STORE SHELVES STOP. CLEARLY FARMERS AND AGRICULTURAL PLAYERS ARE PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT. MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND THE RISK THAT FARMWORKERS SPACE THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES- AND THEY WANT TO KEEP THEM SAFE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A PATCHWORK OF SAFETY GUIDANCE ACROSS OUR STATE AND SUCH GUIDANCE CAN BE. VERY DIFFERENT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR OR STANDARDIZED AND THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A CLEAR UNIFORM STANDARD THAT APPLIES TO ALL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN OUR STATE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'LL MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR FARMERS WHO WANT TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES AND IT WILL KEEP FARM. SAFE WHICH IS IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST. AND I LIKE TO CALL OUT ONE LOCAL EFFORT WHICH I THINK WORKED EXTREMELY WELL SOON AFTER THE PANDEMIC KIT IN THE COUNTY OF RAY REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY THEY CAME TOGETHER- BUT TO AGREE ON COVERT NINETEEN RELATED AGRICULTURAL WORKPLACE SAFETY GUIDELINES. AND NOW THESE THESE GROUPS CRAFTED A DOCUMENT THEY LAKE BEST ACTRESSES FOR KEEPING FARMERS SAFE. I BEEN UPDATED REGULARLY. IT'S BEEN A GOOD RESOURCE FOR AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYERS ACROSS THE DISTRICT. I'LL BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE MAKING THESE DECISIONS ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY LEVEL IT. TOO INCONSISTENT IT'S TWO ONE EVEN IT'S TOO COMPLICATED FOR FARMERS AND IT LEAVES TOO MANY FARM WORKERS AT RISK. WE NEED A SINGLE BUST A SET OF STATEWIDE GUIDELINES TO PROTECT AGRICULTURE WORKERS FROM KOBE NINETEEN. THIS LEGISLATION JUST THAT BY ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE IN THREE WAYS FIRST IT REQUIRES AGRICULTURAL PLAYERS TO IMPLEMENT CAL OSHA'S ALREADY DISSEMINATED COVE IN NINETEEN HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR AG FROM POINT. BUT GUIDELINES ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE. SO SECOND THIS BILL ALSO IT DIRECTS CAL OSHA STANDARDS BOARD TO ADOPT OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. FOR KOBE NINETEEN INFECTION PREVENTION STANDARDS THAT CAN BE AND FORCE. THE STANDARDS ARE WILL INCLUDE BUT SHALL NOT BE- LIMITED TO SANITATION PRACTICES PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. AND THIRD AB TWO ZERO FOUR THREE IMPLEMENT A TARGETED OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ON CAL OSHA'S BEST PRACTICES TO STAY SAFE FROM COLBERT NINETEEN. THIS CAMPAIGN SHOULD CONSIST OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND OUT UP- THE PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS WORKPLACE SIGNS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE TO ALL FARMWORKERS. WHEN YOU TAKE THIS ALL TOGETHER THESE PROVISIONS PROVIDE CLEAR AND STANDARDIZE GUIDANCE TO FARMERS ABOUT HOW TO KEEP THAT PLEASE SAFE. THE BILL ALSO EMPOWERS FARMWORKERS WITH INFORMATION TO THEMSELVES SAFE BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN. WE ALSO PLAN TO MEND THE BILL WHEN POSSIBLE IN SOME IMPORTANT WAYS- WE'D LIKE TO ADD AN URGENCY CLAUSE SO THAT THESE POLICIES CAN BE IMPLEMENTED MUCH MORE QUICKLY. WE ALSO HOPE TO CELEBRATE THE TIME LINE FOR CAL OSHA TO ADOPT THE STANDARDS BY LEVERAGING THE EMERGENCY REGULATION PROCESS OF THE APA THE ADMINISTRATIVE. THE PROCEDURES ACT AND MAKE NO MISTAKE WE ARE THE MEN OF A PILE OF IN C. WITH A NO. IT ENDED. THE STANDARDS ARE. TO ADDRESS THIS. NOW FOR FARMWORKERS SICK. AND OUR FOOD SUPPLY. THREATENED I RECKON THAT SOME AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYERS MAY OBJECT TO WHAT THEY'VE US TOP DOWN REQUIREMENTS FROM BUT I THINK MOST ARE EAGER TO HAVE A CLEAR SAFETY GUIDANCE RIP REPLACING A COUNTY BY COUNTY PATCHWORK IT'S MUCH EASIER TO KEEP YOUR FOR SAFE. IF YOU KNOW OTHER GROWERS ACROSS OUR FALL ON THE SET. I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT IN IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH FORMER. AND THE EYES AS- THESE RULES TO WORK FOR EVERYONE BUT WE MUST ALSO STAY CLEAR EYED ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE- WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR VULNERABLE FARMWORKERS AS THEY WORKED TIRELESSLY TO KEEP FOOD ON OUR TABLES DURING HIS CONDEMNING AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. I WILL WITH I THANK LOCAL. PERFORM FOR FAMILYAND- SAYS ON FOR LACK WHAT. COMPASS THE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SOME MEMBER RIVAS- IN WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES EACH WITNESS WILL HAVE UP TO TWO MINUTES THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO BE. THE PHONE DR L. LOPEZ.

THE CALL THANK AND EXACERBATES ALL OF THESE FACTORS ADDING YET ONE MORE ISSUE TO THEIR ALREADY OVERBURDENED LIVE WHERE AT SOME FARMWORKERS UNDERSTAND THE DANGER OF THE PANDEMIC AND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO PROVE THEMSELVES. DO NOT IT THE SITUATION THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING EITHER IN THE FIELD OR IN THEIR LIVING SITUATION THEY OFTEN ARE ON ABLE TO REGULARLY WASH THEIR HANDS AND IN MY- DO NOT HAVE A PERSONAL ACTED THE QUICK BUT IF THERE ARE. IT ABSOLUTELY IMPACT THAT WE TAKE ALL POSSIBLE STEPS TO PROTECT THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPLYING TWO THIRDS OF THE FRUITS AND NUTS AS WELL AS ONE HALF OF STATE AND BED.

THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL- GOOD TO SEE YOU I'M JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS LAST REVIEWED ON SOMEONE WILL IT IN IN PRINCIPLE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF PREVAILING WAGE AND HAVE BEEN- IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO BY AM CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS PARTICULAR BILL. SIXTEEN THIRTEEN LAST YEAR THAT WAS VETOED BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS ADMINISTRATION. WHAT HAVE WE DONE DIFFERENTLY AND TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY FIVE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS- AT THIS POINT NOT MUCH. OTHER THAN THEIR BEEN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS GOING FORWARD I'M SURE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. WILL BE IVOLVED IN CONVERSATIONS- TO CAUSE US TO MOVE. THIS BILL FORWARD AGAIN THIS YEAR. BECAUSE WE THINK WE'LL FIND SUCCESS AT THE END OF THE ROAD THIS YEAR OR LAST YEAR. YOU ARE CORRECT WE DID. SAY THAT AND YOU KNOW I DO THINK IN I CARL IS KIND OF TOUCHED ON HAD ANOTHER NOTE WRITTEN DOWN HERE ABOUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE FUNDS. TO THE COST OF BUILDING COMES OUT THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE CHARTERS AND YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW IN IN. SITUATION WE HAVE. THE COP THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW- SEEMS. TO BE A LITTLE BIT- CART BEFORE THE HORSE. WHEN RIGHT NOW MY JUST WE JUST WANTS TO OPEN THEIR SCHOOLS BACK UP. SO IN PRINCIPLE I AM VERY SURPRISED. ME LAYING OFF THIS BILL TODAY. BUT IT IS AN INTERESTING- DILEMMA THAT WE- THAT WE HAVE HERE. SO JUST AYE PROCEDURE INTERESTING THANK. YOU I THINK. WAS MADE. THEY WANT TO TAKE 20% OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS POCKET. YES SEE IS REALLY AN EFFORT TO PAY PAY LESS AND GET THE SAME PROP ULTIMATELY MAYBE. MAYBE BUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT WE HAVE A SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE BUILDING. PUBLIC BUILDINGS. PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MUCH MORE BETTER COMPLETED ON TIME AND UNDER BUDGET I THINK IS A GOOD THING. EVERYBODY INCLUDING FOR USE THAT MAKE UP TAKE I'M NOT ARGUING ANY OF THAT. I GET I MEAN I MEAN VERY FOR THE RAID AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AS FAR AS- YOU FOR FAMILY. IT IN SKILLED TRADES FORCIBLE OF THOSE THINGS AND UNDERSTAND. THAT IS THE ONLY NOT CONCERNED. BILL RIGHT. ONE OF MY POINTS IN YOUR I THINK YOU IT DOESN'T PAYING OUR OUR INSTRUCTIONAL ON A JOHN PUBLIC JOB LESS THAT THAT THE ARE TO MAKE. THANK YOU THE CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL- I SUPPORTED YOUR BILL LAST YEAR AB SIXTEEN THIRTEEN- AND I PLAN ON SUPPORTING THEM AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY FIVE THIS YEAR- BECAUSE I SUPPORT% BUILDING WHICH BUT I ALSO HAD SOME CONCERNS. YOU'VE ALREADY ANSWERED SOME RELATED TO THIS BEING THE EXACT SAME BILL I KNOW THAT. I THINK THE ISSUE IS WHETHER CONDUIT BONDS ARE CONSIDERED PUBLIC OR NOT AND THERE SEEMS TO BE THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T. THINK THAT THEY ARE IT WITHOUT WAS THE VETO MESSAGE LAST YEAR OF LISTEN. BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE THAT MY I DON'T RECALL SPECIFICALLY WHAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE. BUT I DON'T BONDS ARE AN ANIMAL OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE. IN FACT- BILL VERY SIMILAR TO THIS APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS THAT ARE BUILT WITH CONDUIT BONDS BECAUSE THEY'RE PUBLICLY SUPPORT BONDS SO YEAH I A- IN YOU KNOW I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPOR- AND BUT I'D UP SOME CONCERTS ENDS AND THESE ARE JUST CAUGHT ON I KNOW CO LOCATE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS- IS A BIG ISSUE I KNOW IN LOS ANGELES. WE HAVE FISH LOCATED IN A LOT OF THEM WANT TO BUILD THEIR OWN BUILDING RIGHT EVENTUALLY OR ARE THEY PLAN AND- AND SO I'M CONCERNED THAT- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS TO DO THAT NOW BECAUSE OF THAT WILL REALLY THE BEST ANSWER FOR ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL WISHES TO IMPROVE SERVICE FOR BUILDING. PLEASE IS TO THROUGH THE- PROGRAM THOSE OF THE SCHOOL BONDS THAT WE HAVE PASSED TRADITIONALLY THIS YEAR WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL- BUT- I EAT THIS YEAR'S BOND AS WELL AS OTHERS HAD MONEY SET ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR CHARTER SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. OKAY SO I I'M SUPPORTIVE OF ENHANCING CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FACILITIES AND THE WAY WE DO THAT IS TO OUR BONDING CAPACITY OF THEIR VOTER APPROVAL DID MAKE IT THIS TIME. BUT AGAIN THAT THAT THAT IS THE- ALLOWABLE VENTURE FOR THOSE IN THE ON THE CHARTER SCHOOL STARTED HELLO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. YOUR NUMBER CREEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE FORMER YEAH HELLO OKAY I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SOMEONE WROTE DONALD I OF COURSE SUPPORT PREVAILING WAGE I'M IN A VERY INTERESTING A SAID BEEN GIVEN THAT. FIFTY ONE WHICHEVER IS THE HIGHEST DENSITY CHARTER DISTRICT IN THE ENTIRE STATE AND A LOT OF THE SAME CONSTABULARY SOME THAT I SHARE AS WELL I DO WANT TO. THE GOV VIDAK MESS HE SAID LAST THIS BILL WILL EXTEND THE APPLET OF PUBLIC WORKS LAW TO CHARTER SCHOOL PROJECTS FINANCED WITH CONDUIT REVENUE BONDS WHILE I SUPPORT PAYMENT A PREVAILING WAGES ON PROJECTS PAID WITH LIKE FUNDS. CONDUIT REVENUE BY OUT FOR FINISHED. BEFORE PROJECTS. I'M SO WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM LAST YEAR I DO HOPE THAT WE GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT. WE HAVE A WIN THIS YEAR AND THAT YOU HAVE YOU'VE DONE THE WORK NECESSARY WITH THE GOVERNOR SOUGHT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT THE SMOKING. WHAT APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER ORDER BILL- BUT REALLY ONE THAT'S OUT WORKING ALL WERE. US AT SURE THAT LATE. THAT THE- LOOK AT. I WOULD. CONSERVE HELPED. HOPE TO WORK WITH AS WELL THANK YOU. AT THE FOREFRONT SET BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE BUILDS A SCHOOL FOR SO TO A QUALITY LEVEL ON TIME BUDGET. THAT'S THE HISTORY COM AND CAN TELL YOU I HAVE CHARTER SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT TO. ASK IF THERE WAS CONSTRUCTION TO GO ON TO THEM I WOULD WANT THAT CONSTRUCTION TO BE CONDUCTED. BY A SKILLED AND- OR SEND IT. IS ALREADY ARE BECAUSE THEY ACCESS THE CALIFORNIA. SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM. THOSE THAT USE THE CONDUIT BONDS WERE TRYING TO BRING IN THEM INTO THAT SPHERE INSURING THAT THEIR PROJECTS ARE ON. TO A HIGH QUALITY LEVEL AND FRIENDSHIPS ARE OFFERED HIS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT KEEP GIVING. RIGHT YOU PUT SOMEONE THROUGH APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. THE GET IN THE MIDDLE CLASS THEY'VE GOT A SKILL SET THAT KEEPS THE MIDDLE CLASS AGAIN THAT IS THE POLICY THAT KEEPS GIVING ARE VERY SUPPORTER OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TO THIRTY ONE WHICH THE FOX WHEN A PUBLIC SUBSIDY IS DE MINIMUS. FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING IF THE BILL LANGUAGE PLIES PRIVATE PROJECTS USING PUBLIC FUNDS. TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC SO ZERO PLATTER PROJECT HAS DIMINISHED. SO LONG AS IT IS LESS. THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS 2% OF THE TOTAL. COST THIS BILL EXEMPTS FROM THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD CONSTRUCTION SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING UNITS. UNDER CURRENT LAW PROJECT IS NOT SUCH A PREVAILING WAGE LAW EVEN IF IT RECEIVES A PUBLIC SUBSIDYIF THAT SUBSIDY IS DIMINISH IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT SINCE THE TURN TO MINIMIZE AS NOT THE FINEST BUT YOU THERE'S NO HINTS AS THE- PUBLIC SUBSIDY. THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DIMINISHED. LET OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE JUST MAKE INCONSISTENT. AS TO WHAT IS DE MINIMUS LEADING TO CONFUSION AND LITIGATION. WHAT THE TERM ACTUALLY MEANS FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO BECAUSE- OF THE DEPARTMENT APPROVED AS DE MINIMUS. THE ONE. MILLION DOLLARS SUBSIDY. ANY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SEVENTY PROJECT SINCE WAS ONLY ONE POINT 75% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY FOR OF A PRIVATE PROJECT THAT IS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR 2% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. IS A NOTABLE TAXPAYER INVESTMENT AND IT IS REASONABLE TO REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGES OF THE DEVELOPER PUBLIC SONS. OVER THAT AMOUNT. THE NINETEEN AND DEMOCRATS PUTTING. FINANCIAL ON OUR WORK FORCE. MANY WORKERS HAVE BEEN LAID OFF THEIR HOURS REDUCED OF TAKEN UNPAID LEAVE TO TAKE CARE FOR THE FAMILY.

A PRIVATE DEVELOPER CAN ACCEPT PUBLIC SUBSIDIES- TOTALING LESS THAN TO PAY THE PREVAILING WAGE- THIS IS THE MINIMUM EXCEPTION WHICH IN AN ACCIDENT TWO THOUSAND A ONE IS APTLY MET INSURE THAT PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT I GETTING. A THE PREVAILING PERCENT SIGNET COST UPPER THAT ONE MIGHT. LET EXAMPLE FEES. ANY IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO MOUNT THE DOLLARS USED BY A I WITHOUT PAYING FOR BILLING WAGE I FORTY THIS IS HOW A FORMER I. R. DIRECTOR RICHARD MANY AGO LEAVE THE PARTICULAR. THE BY. SB IT BECAUSE IT ONLY ONE POINT 64% PRICE COST AFTER THAT THE I R. ASSEMBLY IS TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY LESS GUIDE OR DECISION THAT ANY THE OF LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL PROJECT. ALWAYS TO MINIMIZE EVEN IF THE- LEGAL PORTS TO PROTECT BUT SHOULD BE ON ITS OWN LETTER. THIS BILL WOULD FINALLY PROVIDE CERTAINTY REGARDING THE MEANING OF DE MINIMUS. THE 2% AND FIVE HUNDRED. DEALING WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON PROJECTS UNDER TWENTY FIVE MILLION FURTHERMORE AS MISTER KALRA NOTED AB TWENTY TO THIRTY ONE DOES NOT APPLY TO SINGLE FAMILY HOME CONSTRUCTION. TOOK THEM AND LAST VERSION OF THE OF WEST OF THE OPPONENTS. THE FEDEX HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WILL BE BALLING. ACCEPTED ON THE PART OF THE DEVELOPER. IT IS IMPORTANT REMEMBER. PAYING THE PREVAILING WAGE IS NOT JUST ABOUT HIGHER WAGES IT ALSO PROVIDES EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGHLY SKILLED AND TRAINED LOCAL FIRST AND APPRENTICES. YOU CAN TRAIN. PRO THIS CHART PROJECT AS THE MANY BURNS OUT PURPOSES OF JOINING AND WOMEN SO THAT NEW APPRENTICE INCOME IN AND GET THEIR TRAINING I LIKE GIRL LAWYER SHOULD BE THE LAST TOURNAMENT TAXPAYER DOLLARS WOULD PROVIDE A PRIVATE DEVELOPERS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS SHOULD GO TO PROVIDE THE WAGES.

THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS IN THE QUEUE THANK YOU SO MUCH ANYONE IN OPPOSITION IT'S A GREAT ONE BEEN FROM CAL CAME IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM THAT. A THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. LAST OF THE DAY BIG BILL I ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES I DON'T SPEAK AS QUICKLY AS JENNIFER BIRTH. SO I WILL SIMPLY DIRECT MEMBERS TO OUR LETTER OF OPPOSITION WOULD TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THE SPECIFIC- CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH THE BILL BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TWO POINTS IN THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME HAVE. FIRST OF ALL. IN OUR OPINION THIS BILL THAN JUST THE CURRENT CRISIS OR FUTURE THE MILLER CRISIS WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S AN UNNECESSARY CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT WHAT PROTECTIONS APPLY TO WORKERS IN THE CURRENT CRISIS THAT CONVERSATION HAS BEEN HOW THAT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN THE BLOOD NOW AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE PRO AND ARE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION. WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENGAGE IN GOOD FAITH IS WHEN THIS BILL IS LOADED UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE WITH EVERY LEAVE RELATED PROPOSAL ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR THE LAST DECADE OR MORE. THESE INCLUDE BRING IN SIR DOWN FROM FOR MORE POLICE TO ONE OR MORE EMPLOYEES NOT JUST FOR THE EMERGENCY LEAVE FOR ALL PURPOSES UNDER SO FOR EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY MEMBERS OR SURPRISE AGAIN NOT JUST FOR THE EMERGING. PURPOSES FOR ALL. THE FRONT. BRINGING FOR YOU DISBILITY LAW FIBER PLEASED TO ONE AND MAKE AN UNRELATED CHANGES PAID FAMILY LEAVE AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS TO WORKERS UNDER CRISIS BUT OVER THERE ARE IN AND IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO EAT EVEN BE IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN TO GET TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE BILL. FROM THE TOP COVER STATION ABOUT THE- FAMILY. LEAVE AND THE NEED FOR. SICK LEAVE BUT LET'S NOT BUSINESS AS AN EX. TO ENACT A LAUNDRY LIST A PERMANENT POLICY CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THIS STUFF. THE SECOND ONE TO MAKE IS THIS BILL DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE FACING EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS WORKERS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT MANY WORKERS ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW AND MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL DEALING WITH EMERGENCY FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE. AND PAID SIX. ARE EIGHT. IN THOSE WORKERS. TURN THAT THE CUMULATIVE BURDEN OF ALL THESE. IS BEING PLACED A 100% ON THE BACKS OF EMPLOYERS. BELIEVE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL APPEAR TO BE IN ADDITION TO LEAVE. ENACTED IN RECENT WEEKS IN THE FEDERAL. LEVEL GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR FOOD SECTOR WORKERS. AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE MOST RECENT ENACTMENT. MORE IMPORTANTLY THESE SKILLET OF OBLIGATIONS ARE BEING IMPOSED ON EMPLOYERS OF ANY SIZE WITH NO IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT MANY EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR TWO MONTHS WITH ZERO REVENUE COMING IT. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE NAKED EYE CRLA AND THE CARES ACT THERE WAS AT LEAST AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. BY POLICY MAKERS THAT WE NEED TO FIGHT WAY DOING SIMPLER SO. I AM WITH THESE ARE SHOULD. CREDIT TAX PEARLS. AND ONE MEMBERS PLAYERS DOLLARS DOLLAR NEW OBLIGATIONS. THANK WITHOUT THE REAL THAT WE CAN'T PUT THIS OBLIGATION COMPLETELY ON THE BACKS OF EMPLOYERS AT SOME POINT THIS CONVERSATION BECOMES MERELY ACADEMIC AS I RESOURCE FOR THE SAID 52% OF. BECAUSE IT'S NOT. NOW THE WORD DEALING OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS SO WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO HAVE THIS COVERS TOGETHER AND REALISTICALLY THIS IS GOING TO BE A THEORETICAL AYE THANK YOU SEE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL.

I DIDN'T HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT THE RECALL PROVISION TO YOU GUYS OKAY WITH THAT. WE HAVE. BECAUSE ONLY A FEW MINUTES- LETTER DOES NOT LEARN THE CONCERNS WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT PROPOSAL. WE THINK- THERE ARE SOME LEGAL ISSUES AS WERE RAISED WHEN THE CITY OF LA WAS AN ACTING THAT BOTH CONTRACT- BECAUSE ISSUES. AND POTENTIAL AND ARE IT AND- AREN'T A PREEMPTION ISSUES. WE ALSO SEE THERE SOME PRACTICAL CHALLENGES WITH THE- PROPOSAL IT SAYS YOU HAVE TO RECALL WORKERS IN ORDER OF SENIORITY AND GIVE. EACH WORKER AT TEN BUSINESS DAY OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. TO YOU OFFER THAT JOB TO WHAT THE MOST SENIOR WORKER YOU GIVE THEM TEN BUSINESS DAYS IF THEY SAY NO WE'RE DON'T GET BACK TO YOU. THE NEXT WORK. AFTER WORKER TEN STAYS WE'VE GOT A REAL CHALLENGE WHEN IT COMES TO. RE OPENING AND IS GONNA BOG DOWN IF YOU WANT TO GIVE UP THEIR FEET. IN THOSE COVER INDUSTRIES. EXPLAIN THERE ARE NO BETTER BUT WE- SELECT. PROVISION AS WELL. HAVE YOU BEEN HELPING AT HOME WITH ALL THOSE KIDS. YOUR MOTHER THANK.

BEING IN A SMALL I DISTRICT BENNETT USC AND SOUL LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT THEY DON'T GET HURT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN. THE WHOLE. OF A- AGAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT YOU MAY HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER APOLOGIZED FOR NOT NOT BEING HERE AND IF YOU WE WILL WE CAN DO THIS OFF LINE HERE. TELEVISION PLAN MY CLOTHES ON OKAY. ANYONE ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE. I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW- THE CHAMBERS COMMENTS I MEAN THIS IS A MEAN THROWING GONZALEZ THIS IS A BIG BILL. THERE IS A LOT IN HERE I MEAN YOU COULD PROBABLY HAVE FIVE OR SIX BILLS OUT OF THIS ONE THERE'S A LOT OF MATERIAL HERE AND I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE RIGHT HE'S- DONE SO YOU'RE YOU'RE- ON THE SMALL BUSINESS ASPECT OF IT. BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE BILLS WHAT DO FIND THE- SEARS ISSUE YOU BRING UP LIKE THE ETHNIC STORES AS- SMALL. STORE GET SUCKED IN THANKS OF THE LEAD THAT WE TALK ABOUT. IT TOOK ME. WHAT ARE DISTRICT MIGHT IS NOT DIFFERENT. RELATES TO THE SMALL COMMUNITY. SO IT IS A HUGE CAN. BUT I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU KNOW THE CHAIR AND I KNOW YOUR HEART ALL OF THIS BUT- LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN TRY TO PROTECT THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT SAID. HOW THE AXIS. WE LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU. I'M SAY THE- THIS THE- THING. THE BIG WISHES HE SAID INTEREST IN THE FIRST DRAFT OF IT. ALL THAT BEING SO A COUPLE POINTS I AGREE COMPLETELY THE SUMMARY JONES SAWYER THAT LOOK AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN WE'RE IN NUMBERS TO SEE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHO IS AND WHO HAS THE LEAST ABILITY TO RESPOND. YOU START WITH THE WORK LAID SERVICE SECTOR I HAVE TO GO HOME AND TAKE CARE LOVE ONES. THERE THEY HAD THE LEAST OF IT BOB AND FLEXIBLE THE AT AMP OR MENTOR UNDER THE BILL OF PROTECT THOSE. A REALLY THE MOST. I THINK TO LOOK AT OKAY NOW THE BILL. CONS YEAH A PLUS EMPLOYERS YOU HAVE A LOT AND IS THE YOU HE'S WILL HAVE YOU. YOU HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS I THINK IT'S A UPON OF US THIS HOW WE HELP THOSE THAT THOSE LIKE THE NATIONAL. AND SO WE SUBSIDIES PUBLIC BECAUSE WE HAVE EMERGENCY FUNDS TO GO TO THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES FIRST SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LEARNING A LOT THIS WERE STEM FROM THE FEDERAL BILL. DID NOT HAPPEN. IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S- OR YOU KNOW OF THAT THAT'S HAPPENED MY DISTRICT. OR YOU KNOW ES DE. UPDATE LIKE RIGHT NOW. WE SHOULD ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT DON'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL.

AND ON THE RIGHT TO RECALL- WITH THE CHAMBERS OPPOSITION INDICATE. WHAT HURT. I'M AN THE NEW RISK WORKER I THINK IMPLIES THAT. AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF THOSE THAT ARE SENIOR AND HAVE THE EXPERIENCE WOULD BE. JETTISONED THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE SO THAT THE IN THE NUMBERS AND SEE. THOSE THAT HAVE THAT SENIORITY SHOULD BE THE FIRST CONSIDERED TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN THOSE JOBS AND CERTAINLY. PROCEDURALLY COULD BE BIGGER IT'S AN UNNOTICED ALL. FOUND OUT AND TO SEE IF THEY'RE INTERESTED RETAIN. SINCE YOU WERE ON THE IS AND GO FROM THERE. STARTING AT THE TOP OF LIST AS TO WHO KNOWS THE MOST SENIORITY.
