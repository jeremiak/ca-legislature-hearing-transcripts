EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT COMMITTEE. AN ABSENCE OF A QUORUM WILL START AS SUBCOMMITTEE. WITHOUT THERE A FEW MONTHS NOW ANNOUNCEMENTS TO MAKE. THERE ARE SIX ITEMS ON THE AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FOUR SP FOUR THIRTY WHITE HOUSE HE HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. THERE ARE TWO ITEMS LIKE CONSENT COLORED OUT TAKING UP ONLY STOPS A QUORUM THERE ARE ITEM NUMBER TWO SB. ONE EIGHTY FOUR MORE LOCK AND ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB. SEVEN EIGHTY TWO SENATE LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT COMMITTEE. WITHOUT LET'S GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST AUTHOR WE HAVE CENTER NIELSEN [inaudible] WELL. WORKING ON THIS FOR SOME TIME. THERE'S BEEN THE MANY YEARS HERE KIND OF AN ELECTED CLASS BULLIES AND THEY CAPTION FLOYD. IN MY ROLE. OPPORTUNITY. TO PARTICIPATE. IN A FOR MORE FAIR MINDED WAY. AND WHAT IT WOULD DO IS SET UP AN ARBITRATION. PROCESS. IF. AN EMPLOYEE FILES A GRIEVANCE NOW. THESE GRIEVANCES ARE ROUTINELY DENIED. SO IT'S ALMOST A MOCKERY. SAYS THEY HAVE NO OPTIONS OTHER THAN GO TO THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD OR THE COURT [inaudible] AND THAT'S TIME CONSUMING IT AFFECTS CERTAINLY THE EMPLOYEE. DOESN'T REALLY HELP THE STATE. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO OPTIMIZE THE GRIEVANCE ROCESS? ALLOWING THE EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES TO REQUEST ARBITRATION. AFTER THEY WOULD NOT A BIG IS LOST THE NORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCESS. AND THAT'S A KIND OF A NORMAL THING IN STATE GOVERNMENT YEP EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT. ADDITIONALLY THIS ADDS A LOSER PAY MODEL. THIS IS A FILTER A CONSCIENCE. ON FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS. AND ALLOWS THE PARTIES AND GIVE SOME INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO SERIOUSLY. CONSIDER RESOLVING THINGS IN ARBITRATION. WE'VE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THIS BILL OVER THE YEARS. END OF CHIEFS A MINOR AND THAT I THINK SIGNIFICANT. TECHNICAL CHANGES THAT WOULD NARAL [inaudible] THE BILL. AND STOP THE WASTED RESOURCES. OF THIS CONTINUED. AND PROTRACTED LITIGATION. IF THERE'S EVER TO BE A RESOLUTION. AND PARTICULARLY TOGETHER. SOME RECOGNITION. TO THESE EXPLODED EMPLOYEES. WHO ARE SO OFTEN FORGOTTEN? AND KEEP IN MIND. AND THIS IS KIND OF GOING A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM THE BILL BUT EXPLODED EMPLOYEES OR WHAT I HAVE CALLED. KIND OF YOUR YOUR BENCH. THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TALENT. IN SOME AMBITION. THEY LEARN THEIR JOBS. AND THEY'RE WILLING TO STEP UP AND TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY. AND VERY OFTEN THEY PAY A PRICE. VERY OFTEN THEY GET LESS MONEY. FOR TAKING THAT EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY [inaudible] AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE. THE EMPLOYEES CAN REQUEST IS BINDING ARBITRATION. WHEN A TITLE TO GRIEVANCES BEEN FILED [inaudible] CATTLE HR. AND WHEN THE HAVE GRIEVANCE. RED AS NOT BEEN RESOLVED AT THE MULTI REVIEW LEVEL IN OTHER WORDS EXHAUSTING THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE STEPS. THEN IT ALLOWS A PROCESS WHEREBY. HR AN EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION CAN AGREE O AN IMPARTIAL ARBITRATOR. THAT ARBITRATION WOULD BE BINDING WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS. AND THE NON PREVAILING PARTY. WOULD PAY THE COST. SURE TO CALL THE BASEBALL STYLE. RESOLUTION. BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I THINK THAT THIS BRING SOME EQUITY. AND NO REAL HARM. TO OUR STATE. EMPLOYEES BARGAINING PROCESS AN HR. AND I HAVE WITH THIS TODAY FROM WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU -- FOR BEFORE GOING FURTHER GOING STEPS QUORUM SINCE WE DO HAVE ALL MEMBERS PRESENT A SECTOR CALL THE ROLL PLEASE RODRIGUEZ [inaudible] VOEPEL [inaudible] CERVANTES.

TWO SIXTY SIX PROTECTS THE PROMISED AND PAID FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF CALPERS MEMBERS BY MAKING SURE NO HARM COMES TO RETIREE FOR ANY COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED PENSIONABLE COMPENSATION. THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE SYSTEM THIS MEANS RISK THIS MAJOR RESPONSE TO CASES IN WHICH PENSIONABLE COMPENSATION OF RETIRED EMPLOYEES. IS WRECKED OF RETROACTIVELY DEEMED DISALLOWED BY CALPERS. IN THESE INSTANCES THE RETIRED EMPLOYEES ARE FORCED TO PAY BACK THE TOTAL OVERPAID AMOUNT. AND SUFFER PERMANENT REDUCTIONS TO THEIR PENSIONS MANY RETIREES RELY ON FIXED INCOMES AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED CUTS TO THEIR BENEFITS. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. LONG AFTER THEY'VE MADE THE DECISION TO RETIRE SB TWO SIXTY SIX GIVES RETIREES LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME PEACE OF MIND THAT THE RETIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE EARNED AND PAID FOR OVER A LIFE. OF PUBLIC SERVICE WILL CONSISTENTLY BE THERE THROUGHOUT THE RETIREMENT YEARS. THIS BILL COMPELS CALPERS AND EMPLOYERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT RETIREE BENEFITS AND PREVENT THESE INSTANCES FROM EVER HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. SB TWO SIXTY SIX ALSO COMPELS EMPLOYERS TO KEEP THEIR PROMISES TO RETIREES AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FOR ANY REDUCTIONS TO THE WRIST RETIREMENT. AS A RESULT OF DISALLOWED COMPENSATION HERE WITH ME AND SUPPORT IS CHRISTY BELMONT. AND BRANDY. GO AHEAD MA'AM SUPPORT GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY VELMA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS PLEASED TO BE A CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. WE THINK THE CENTER FOR BRING IT BACK. UP TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT CAME TO LIGHT INITIALLY FOR US WHEN THE CITY DAVIS FIREFIGHTER SHE HAD WORKED FOR CITY OF DAVIS WELL OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS RETIRED AND WAS FIVE YEARS INTO HER RETIREMENT WHICH SHE GOT HER LETTER FROM THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM THAT SAID -- THE THE COMPENSATION THAT WAS REPORTED FOR YOU THAT WAS IN YOUR BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT WAS CONSIDERED LONGEVITY PAY WHICH IS. SUPPOSED TO BE ALLOW WILL BENEFIT ON THE SYSTEM THE CALPERS OF THE EMPLOYER WAS MISS A PLYING IT. AND THEREFORE A CENTER LETTER THAT SAID YOU NEED TO SEND US A CHECK FOR FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE WILL PERMIT THE REDUCE YOUR PENSION FOR THE REST OF YOUR PENSION WILL PERIOD AND TO YOUR BENEFICIARY SO THIS BILL JUST SIX TO PROTECT THAT RETIREE. THE EMPLOYER IS OBLIGATED TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH. A AND IN REPORT TO THE SYSTEM AND CHECK WITH THE SYSTEM IF THIS THIS AMOUNT OF THE ITEM OF COMPENSATION WHETHER IT'S ON JEOPARDY PAYER EDUCATIONAL SET OF PAY. HAZARD PAY E. M. T. PAY THESE ARE ALL VALID PAY ITEMS BUT IT IS UP TO THE EMPLOYER TO MAKE SURE THEY FIT WITHIN THE REGULATIONS OF THE SYSTEM. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS SOME CONFUSION DISALLOWED COMPENSATION IS JUST THAT IT IS IN A CATEGORY A KNOWN CATEGORY OF COMPENSATION TO CALPERS BUT WITH RULES AROUND IT THE OFFER TO THE SAME GROUP OR CLASS. IS THAT ON A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE PAY SCHEDULE THOSE ARE ALL EMPLOYER OBLIGATIONS I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT. A CLERICAL ERROR WHERE A NUMBER IS REPORTED THAT WAS INCORRECT BECAUSE OF A MATHEMATICAL AIR THERE'S A WHOLE BODY OF LAW UNDER PURRS. THAT HAND. TELL THEM HOW TO HANDLE A TYPOGRAPHICAL OR CLEAR CLEAR ABOUT REPORTING COMPENSATION SO THIS IS DISTINCT INTO DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT WAS BARGAINED AND AS OUR AUTHOR SAID IT WAS PAID. FOR BY ALL PARTIES WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT AGAIN TODAY. MR MEMBERS RAINY PERIOD EVERY DISSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF PORAC IN HIGH PATROL CESSATION. VERY SUPPORT OF CAN SEE MORE CHRISTY JUSTICE. THAT ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. MORE MISTER MEMBERS RYAN CHARMER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION WERE CALPERS MEMBERS AND WE STRONGLY ARCHER PASSAGE OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE'S PORT. CA NINETY ANYONE IN OPPOSITION COMFORT. YOUR FRIEND THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM. IT'S GOT A BETTER SUIT ON THAT I HAVE SO I GO HEAD -- GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS DATE HUTCHINGS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- RESPECT IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE -- YOU KNOW FIRST OFF. AS AMENDED. IT PUT PLACES A REAL BURDEN -- ON ON LOCAL AGENCY THAT SHIPS EMPLOYER WITH REGARDS DISALLOWED COMPENSATION WHEN THE BILL WAS AMENDED. IT REALLYPROVIDED A DISINCENTIVE FOR CALPERS TO ACCURATELY CALCULATE AND TO ADMINISTER BENEFITS -- AS GOVERNOR BROWN STATED IN HIS VETO MESSAGE. WE WANTED TO ENSURE HIS SUGGESTION WAS THAT -- THAT CALPERS THE REQUIRED TO REVIEW EACH COP COP ANALYSIS TO ENSURE. THAT TO WILL BE MUTUALLY AGREED UPON BY BOTH LABOR AND MANAGEMENT IT'S MINUTES PURRS WAS IN FACT LAWFUL AND AND NINE AND AND ALLOWED NOT DISALLOW COMPENSATION WHEN THE BILL WAS AMENDED OUT OF THE SENATE -- ALL OF THAT LIABILITY I WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM CALPERS AND REALLY EVEN IF WE EXERCISE OUR OPTION TO HAVE COOPER OF YOU CALPERS CAN SIMPLY SAY YEP YOU'RE GOOD TO GO AND THEN FIVE YEARS LATER. SAY NEVER MIND WE MADE A MISTAKE -- IT IF IT IT WAS IN FACT I DISALLOWED COMPENSATION. THERE ARE NEARLY THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYERS ANDY CALPERS SYSTEM SOME OF THOSE EMPLOYERS HAVE DOZENS OF BARGAINING UNITS EACH OF THOSE BARGAINING UNITS HAVE. SOPHISTICATED TOURNEY'S UP BOTH ON BOTH SIDES THAT MUTUALLY AGREED TO THE BEST OF THEIR UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE LAW AS THEY INTERPRETED -- MUTUALLY GRAHAM WHAT IS A CUT WHAT IS DISALLOWED COMPLEMENT IS NOT TO SLOW COP IT'S MEANT THAT TO PURRS THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMEONE. PURRS BEING THE ADMINISTRATOR THE BENEFIT THAT IS THE STATUS THE FAIL SAFE THE STOP GAP ON WHAT IS ALLOWED TO WHAT IS NOT ALLOWED AND I DON'T MEAN FIVE YEARS LATER. I MEAN THEY SHOULD DO A PRIOR TO WHEN FOLKS ARE TIRED BECAUSE BE AGREE THAT WHEN WHEN FOLKS RETIRE THEY SHOULDN'T THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO YOU KNOW GET A LETTER IN THE MAIL FROM HER SAYING THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE REDUCING OR BENEFIT THAT IS. CERTAINLY THE WORST CASE SCENARIO -- IT THIS BILL TO BE CLEAR YOU WILL REQUIRED LOCAL AGENCIES TO CUT DIRECT CHECKS FROM THEIR GENERAL FUNDS. TO RETIRE REASON BUT AND BENEFICIARIES IN PERPETUITY -- IT AS AS WELL AS THE STATE -- THAT WE'RE TALKING AFTER. THE FACT THAT PERSON SAID THIS IS A DISALLOWED BENEFIT THIS IS NOT LAWFUL UNDER UNDER PEARL. YOU LOCAL AGENTS YOU'RE GOING TO BE CUTTING DIRECT CONTRIBUTION CHECKS TO THESE PEOPLE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES SO I JUST AND WE JUST NEED TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR. AND THEY'RE STILL UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WITH THIS BILL WITH REGARDS TO RECIPROCITY AS WE NOTED IN OUR IN OUR LETTER YOU KNOW IF A IF A MEMBER WORKS FOR MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND IT WAS THERE WAS DIVERSE YOU KNOW PERHAPS DISALLOWED COMP. THAT WAS ADDED YOU KNOW AGREE TO OUT OF OUR AT OUR FORMER AGENCY THEY WOULD YOU KNOW WHEN THAT RETIRED WHEN THEY RETIRE. UNDER RECIPROCITY CALPERS ISSUES THAT SHOULD THE ISSUES THAT BENEFIT UNDER THIS PARADIGM WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CUT FOR CUTTING THAT CHECK WOULD BE THE CITY THAT THE PERSON WORK FOR WOULD BE THE CITY THAT THE PERSON RETIRED FROM. WE'RE NOT SURE -- ADDITIONALLY THIS IS GONNA REQUIRE ADDITIONAL GAS BE SIXTY REPORTING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE HIRING -- OUTSIDE ACTUARIES TO ASSESS WHAT THOSE LIABILITIES ARE IN PERPETUITY -- AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT WE E. I I KNOW WHAT THIS IS EVERYONE'S FAVORITE ARGUMENT BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS TO GIVE THE PUBLIC FUNDS IT'S IT'S IN VIOLATION THE CONSTITUTION IT'S UNLAWFUL AND WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. ANYONE ELSE Là POSITION. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BROUGHT HOLD ON BEHALF OF PLASTER COUNTING. THIS ISSUE IS VERY REAL TO PLASTER COUNTY AT THIS TIME. OF PLACER COUNTY HAS ALSO RECEIVED A DENIAL OF COMPENSATION FROM CALPERS REGARDING A LONGEVITY PROVISION. BUT IN CONTRAST TO THE CITY OF DAVIS PLASTER COUNTY HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG. AND THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE WITH THIS PRESIDENT LEADS LEGISLATION. WHO DETERMINES WHEN THE ACTUAL THAT CITY OR THE LOCAL ENTITY IS THE AGENT OF OF -- THE AIR THAT CALPERS IS CALLING OUT AT FOUR DISALLOWED COMPENSATION. IN THE CASE OF PLASTER COUNTY THE LONGEVITY PROVISION HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN PAYING INTO THIS LONGEVITY PROVISION IT HASN'T CHANGED ONCE WELL WHEN BET IT'S PLUS COUNTY HAS UNDERGONE CALPERS AUDITS -- WE'VE PROCEEDED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IN REGARDS. TO THE LONGEVITY PROVISION. MAKING PAYMENTS TO CALPERS EMPLOYEES MAKING PAYMENTS TO CALPERS AND THEN NOT UNTIL SO FROM NINETEEN NINETY FOUR UNTIL JUST IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EXCUSE ME -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALPERS CONSIDERED THIS PROVISION COMPLETELY FINE. NOW THEY'RE SAYING NO WE'RE DISALLOWING IT'S DISALLOWED COMPENSATION SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN UNDER THIS LEGISLATION. IT TAKES AWAY THE RIGHTS OF PLASTER COUNTY. AND ALL OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES TO APPEAL THAT DECISION. BECAUSE THE DECISION ONCE IT IS MADE BY -- CALPERS VAN THAT TRIGGERS ALL THE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS THAT ARE DETAILED IN THE LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN APPEAL PROCESS THAT WE'RE UNDERGOING. BUT BASED ON THE LEGISLATION AS WRITTEN. IF THE APPEAL PROCESS ISN'T COMPLETED. THE FOR THIS LEGISLATION IS IF IT IS -- CONSIDERED AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. THE WE WOULD LOSE THAT APPEAL PROCESS [inaudible] SO. DUE PROCESS RIGHTS ARE FROM BEING DAMAGED BY THIS UP -- LEGISLATION. INCREASED FINANCIAL RISK ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC ENTITIES NOT JUST PLASTER COUNTY. THIS IS A COMPLETE NEW PARADIGM SHIFT FROM. WHAT EXISTS NOW TO PUTTING THE THE SOLE BURDEN ON THE LOCAL ENTITY? IT WOULD BE DRAMATIC WHEN YOU CONSIDER NOT ONLY THE EXISTING MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN PAYING INTO. THE ARM. CALPERS FOR THIS PROVISION BUT ALL OF THE RETIRED MEMBERS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. IT GOES TO THE ISSUE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS THIS LEGISLATION. BASICALLY. ORDERS THE LOCAL ENTITY TO MAKE GOOD. ON A PROVISION THAT HAS BEEN TURNED DETERMINED BY CALPERS. SHOULD BE DISALLOWED BALL. SO IT IT AFFECTS IT'S IT'S NOT ONLY ADDRESSES THE GOES TO THE ISSUE OF GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS. BUT IT GOES TO THE ISSUE OF ACTUALLY ORDERING A PUBLIC ENTITY TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY AND MAKE GOOD. BASED SOLELY ON THE DECISION OF CALPERS SO [inaudible] COM. THE PROBLEM HERE. IS THAT. OVER THE YEARS AN INTERPRETATION BY CALPERS. CHANGES THEY WILL SAY OF THIS IS GOOD AND THEN TWENTY YEARS LATER THEY'LL SAY THIS IS BAD. AND IF NOTHING HAS CHANGED NO RULES HAVE CHANGED HOW IT HOW IS THAT FAIR TO THE LOCAL ENTITIES WHO FOR RELIED ON ALL OF THE CIRCULAR LETTERS. OF RELIED ON ALL OF THE MEETINGS AUDIT EVERY TIME. SOMEONE RETIRES THEY GO THROUGH THESE PROVISIONS THEY GO THROUGH THE ARM. LONGEVITY PROVISION OR OR WHATEVER PROVISION YOU YOU WOULD CONSIDER [inaudible] CAN AND EACH TIME IF IT'S APPROVED IT REINFORCES WITH THE LOCAL ENERGY. AND THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES BUT YES THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE BENEFIT AT THE END OF THE DAY MOST CERTAINLY. INDIVIDUALS NEED TO HAVE. FINANCIAL CLARITY FINANCIAL CERTAINTY WITH THEIR PENSIONS. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GOAL IS OF THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION. AND I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE INDIVIDUALS THE PARTICULAR OF FIREFIGHTERS FROM THE CITY OF DAVIS I REVIEWED THAT ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER AND I KNOW THAT IT'S STILL PENDING. CALPERS HAS NOT FINALIZED THEIR DECISION REGARDING THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS -- BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO SOLVE THIS AND A BETTER -- METHOD OF ATTAINING THE GOAL. THAT'S SOUGHT IN THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ELIZABETH WELL THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS WERE NOT -- WE HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION BASED ON THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS THANK YOU. JEFF NEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO IN OPPOSITION. DOLE JOYS WITH PLASTIC COUNTY I JUST WANT TO GET ON THE RECORD THAT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE HAVE CONFIRMED WOULD COST US AROUND SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. GOOD MORNING CARE ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN MARCOS IN OPPOSITION. DON'T GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. REMEMBER TRUST ABOUT THEM AT THE SEA OF TECHNO WE APOLOGIZE WE GET A LETTER IN BUT WOULD BACK ARE CONCERNED WITH THE LEAGUE THE VOICE. WITH THAT ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEN ON ANY QUESTION BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SOMEONE OUT ON WHAT YES THANK YOU -- SO SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHO WOULD BE THE BAD ACTOR IN THIS EXERCISE SOMEONE GOES TO APPLY FOR A BIG THE TURN OF THE PAPERWORK THEY'RE GONNA RETIRE. WAS IT CALPERS AT THE TIME THEY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO RETIRE AND DIDN'T CALCULATE THE BENEFITS CORRECTLY SIMPLY DIDN'T DIDN'T TELL THEM. WHO WHO WHO WHO IS THE BAD ACTOR HERE IF WE PLAY LACK OF A BETTER TERM EMPLOYERS THE ONE WHO'S MADE THE MISTAKE? THEN IN THIS CASE DISTRICT IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE FOR TIME AS LONG IT WAS LONGEVITY. SOMEHOW THEY DIDN'T. I THOUGHT LONGEVITY DIDN'T COUNT. SERVING THAT SAID IN A BAR IN HIM FOR MANY YEARS AGO SB. I'M JUST REFLECTS HELP LONGEVITY WOULDN'T COUNT. RIGHT SO YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE CALPERS STATUTE AND REGULATION THEY HAVE RULES. GUIDING WHAT LONG JET WHAT QUALIFIES FOR LONGEVITY PAY AND AND WHAT WE'RE DISCOVERING WHEN WE HEAR THESE THINGS AT THAT. EMPLOYERS GET CREATIVE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE AND MAYBE THEY SAY THE LONGEVITY PAY -- IS AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE AND THEN OVER GOING TO TIE IT TO SOMETHING ELSE ALSO. AND THAT IS NOT HOW LONG HAVE ANY PAY IS AWARDED IT IS BASED ON YOUR OWN TERMS SERVICE WITH THE EMPLOYER AND AT ALL IT'S OFFERED TO EVERYBODY WHO REACHES THAT. THRESHOLD WE'VE ALSO SEEN EMPLOYERS TO SAY WILL BARGAIN HAZARD PAY BUT WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE THAN SIX PEOPLE EVER AT A TIME. TO QUALIFY FOR THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT HAVE. TEN FIREFIGHTERS THAT HAVE THAT CERTIFICATION FOR FOR SOME HAS MET SPECIALTY. OKAY SO THEY'RE VIOLATING THE WAY THEY'RE REAP THEIR REPORTING IT. IT'S CALPERS IT CATCHES IT AND THEN DETERMINES SO THE TREATING LIKE LONGEVITY PASSED LIKE SPIKING. WHEN IN FACT IT'S NOT SPIKING? BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT WHEN THESE AGREEMENTS ARE MADE THEIR MADE SO BY. VERY SOPHISTICATED TURNS ON BOTH SIDES TO UNDERSTAND THE LAW AS THEY BELIEVE IT IS INTERPRETED WE SUBMIT THESE THESE MO USE OR THESE THESE. BOB. THIS COMPETITION TO CALPERS WHO AS WAS STATED BY -- PLASTER COUNTY FOR YEARS HAVE SAID THAT IT'S FINE AND THEN GO BACK AND SAY WAIT NEVER MIND NO IT'S NOT. IT'S A WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT AS WE AGREE OF THESE. AND THEN THEY GO BACK FIVE YEARS LATER AND STATE YOU KNOW NEVER MIND IN FACT I BELIEVE IN PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IN THE CASE OF THE CITY DAVIS FIREFIGHTER. CREATED -- ACTUALLY SOUGHT A COMPENSATION REVIEW FROM HERS PRIOR TO RETIRING AND THEY SAID YEP YOU ARE GOOD TO GO AND THEN FIVE YEARS LATER. THEY SAID WHOOPS NEVER MIND YOU'RE NOT AND SO I YOU KNOW THERE IS A EITHER TO SAY THAT IT'S SOLELY THE EMPLOYER THAT IS THE ARE THE BAD ACTOR ON THIS ONE I I I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A MIS CHARACTERIZATION. THAT'S WERE. IN OKAY A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT AYE AYE THE DATA I SEE HERE IS ACTUALLY I WOULD ARGUE SOMEWHAT MINIMAL. BUT THEN I HEARD SOMEONE COME UP IT'S A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON THEIR ON THEIR ON THEIR SINGLE COUNTY. THE ONLY COMMON AND IT'S SO WHAT I WOULD SAY HE SAID SIXTEEN MILLION WHAT I WOULD SAY IS HOW DOES HE KNOW DOES HE KNOW THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT THEY'RE NOT PAYING PROPERLY. IF I COULD RESPOND. TO TWO THINGS. IN REGARDS TO THE IMMEDIATE QUESTION. UP THE SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE COMES FROM A CALCULATION OF HOW MUCH HAS BEEN CONTRIBUTED TO CALPERS SINCE. ON THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS IT DIDN'T EVEN GO BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BY BOTH EMPLOYEES AND THE EMPLOYER. CALPERS CAN CLAW BACK THREE YEARS WORTH OF A CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MEMBERS AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW. THEY ALSO PURSUANT TO THIS LEGISLATION THEY COULD GO BACK TO EXISTING MEMBERS AND SAY HEY GUESS WHAT. WE'VE BEEN PAYING YOU THIS PARTICULAR RETIREMENT BENEFITS BENEFIT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS BUT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A HAIR CUT NOW BECAUSE WE'VE DECIDED NOW AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THAT IT YOU NO LONGER. SHOULD DESERT YOU SHOULD RECEIVE THIS LONGEVITY PAY. SO THE THAT THE THE NUMBERS ARE REAL. AND THE WAY THE WAY THIS LEGISLATION IS SET UP. IT'S THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE COUNTIES THE CITIES THAT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING GOOD ON A DETERMINATION BY CALPERS. BASED ON A NEW INTERPRETATION. OF OF OF THEIR LONGEVITY PROVISION THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S NOT GOOD NOW WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN ARE THERE NEW INTERPRETATIONS WELL MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING. FOR FOR MONEY. MAYBE THAT IS WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON THE PROCESS IS. WHEN SOMEONE RETIRES ALTHOUGH CALPERS THEY DO AUDITS AND THEY'VE DONE AUDITS OF PLASTER COUNTY AND LONGEVITY HAS NEVER? BEEN CALLED OUT THE PROCESS IS FOR WHEN SOMEONE RETIRES. THEY RECEIVE A REPORT FROM THE LOCAL ENTITY AS TO WHAT IS THE COMPENSATION AND IT'S BROKEN DOWN AND DURING THAT TIME CALPERS COMES UP WITH. IN FACT I THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF DAVIS. THE THE QUESTION WILL HOLD IT WHY ARE YOU GETTING THIS LONGEVITY LET'S LOOK AT THE LONGEVITY. AND AND IT IT IN THEIR MIND IT DID NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR DEFINITION OF LONGEVITY. HERE. WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR LONGEVITY. YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED CALPERS HASN'T CHANGED YOUR DEFINITION OF LONGEVITY NOTHING IS CHANGED IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE'VE BEEN AUDIT. YOU'VE REVIEWED THIS EVERY SINGLE TIME SOMEONE HAS RETIRED. THE HIGHER EARNERS WHEN THE HIGHER EARNERS RETIRED THE THEY DO MULTI MONTH. INVESTIGATIONS THERE'S AN O. H. DECISION THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE PLASTER COUNTY -- LONGEVITY PROVISION AND IN THAT CASE THEY DID NOT CONTEST THE ARM THE LONGEVITY PROVISION BUT NOW THE NOW OUT THERE TO CONTESTING IT OKAY SO REAL QUICK. JUST ONE REAL QUICK. IT'S IT'S NOT BLACK AND WHITE IN THE SENSE THAT YOU CAN PLACE ALL OF THE BLAME ON THE EMPLOYER. AND NONE OF THE BLAME ON CALPERS. IT'S IT'S JUST NOT LIKE THAT IN REALITY IT TELLS ME LIKE. WE'RE WE'RE I'M HEARING THE WORD LONGEVITY THE TERM LONGEVITY A LOT SEEM LIKE THE PROBLEM IS THE INTERPRETATION. OF LONGEVITY I DON'T SEE HOW CALPERS CAN EVER CONSIDER IT NOT TO BE PART OF NORMAL COMPENSATION WHEN IT'S ON THE SCHEDULE ITS BARGAINING CENTER BUT THAT. THAT'S PROBABLY NOT WHITE BUT I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE NECESSARILY HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT AGAIN YOUR INTENT IS THAT THIS APPLIES TO ALL PUBLIC AGENCIES INCLUDING CHARTER SCHOOLS CORRECT. YES ECHO IT WILL IT WILL APPLY TO CHARTERS CUTS OUT SALUTE IF THAT'S NOT CLEAR WE WILL MAKE THAT CLEAR OKAY THANK MY INTENT WAS NEVER TO KEEP THEM I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND IT'S ONE MAKE SURE BECAUSE YES. SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY IF THEY'RE NOT IN. THAT EVERYONE. AROUND IS TRUE AND THEN WE HAVE A COURT -- SO -- WITH THAT I THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHO WOULD HAVE REQUIRED COMMA THERE'S A CASE PLAYING ON A SECOND COUNTY THAT GOES BACK TO THE EIGHTIES A BENEFIT THAT WAS NEGOTIATED? AND WHAT HAPPENED IS A NEW -- RETIREMENT BOARD DIRECTOR COME IN CO AND SAID NO THEY SHOULD RECEIVE THESE BENEFITS SO HER SUDDEN IT GOES BACK. THIRTY SOMETHING YEARS AND NOW THEY'RE CHANGING IT AND WHO GETS TO THE IN THE EMPLOYEE DOES RETIREES. SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE BOTH SIDES GO IN. NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS YEAH CALPERS I BELIEVE THIS GROUP ONCE IN AWHILE. BUT WHEN YOU KNOW YOU GET NEGOTIATED CONTRACT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE YOUR ATTORNEYS THERE AND IF SOMEONE NEGOTIATED THAT CONTRACT THAT'S ON THEM ON EITHER SIDE I MEAN SO IT'S IT'S KIND OF HARD IN. NO IT'S NOT LAST NIGHT WE GOT SOME MOM LEADS WITH CITIES MY LOCAL CITIES SENT ME LETTERS OPPOSITION AT FIVE O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT. THAT'S B. S. IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM. HAVE THOSE FOLKS WAY IN EARLIER. THE LEGAL AID INTO THE CITY'S DIDN'T CELLS LIKE HEY. IS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU THAN WAY IN EARLY THIS ISSUE. AND A FIVE O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT AND IT'S DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. BUT THE BIG ISSUE IS LIKE I SAID I'VE SEEN PUT OUT ON BOTH SIDES. I SIMPLY PROJECT NEGOTIATED AND GOT NO WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GO INTO IT WITH WHAT EYES WIDE OPEN SO. THIS IS MY TWO CENTS WITHOUT THAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OFFER SOME ARTICLE IT'S I GUESS I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL BUT THERE'S A DAY IN THIS AREA GENERALLY AND I I'M I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW I WOULD. FATHOM THE MEANING WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION. SOLIS WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PENSIONS SYSTEM LIES WITH THE RETIREMENT BOARD. THIS INCLUDES A PAYMENT OF BENEFITS IT'S ADMINISTRATION SO CONSTITUTIONALLY SOLIS WHO'S RESPONSIBLE AS A PRUDENT EXPERT BECAUSE THAT'S A STANDARD VOTERS ADDED IN JUNE OF EIGHTY FOUR UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE SPECIFICALLY IN THE CONSTITUTION NOT RETIREMENT BOARD'S. SO I SEE IS KIND OF DOING SOME ADJUSTMENT BETWEEN. THE RETIREMENT BOARD. UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOME ALLOCATION OF WHO'S RESPONSIBLE. BUT I SEE THE UNDERLYING CONSCIOUS RAISES SAYS IT'S RETIREMENT BOARD ITS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE INCLUDES ADMINISTRATION -- SO I'M ALMOST ONE IF THERE IS SOME. WELL WHILE WE'RE TAKEN WITH THE STATUTES WHETHER THIS. UNDER GIRDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. TO FIND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE IN THE TOP. THE EXTERNAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE IS A SPECIFIC DEFINITION THE CUSTOMS TO SAYS RETIREMENT BOARD DOES NOT INCLUDE LOCAL ELECTED. SO I HI JUST ADMITTING THAT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL HER TODAY. BUT I EXACTLY HOW THIS WORKS IN CONNECTION TO THE RELEVANT CONSCIOUS PROVISION. IS ACTUALLY SORT OF A QUESTION MY MIND. THANK YOU WITHOUT SAID ANOTHER QUESTION BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATOR LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHE THE DISCUSSION -- BUT I JUST WANT TO ALSO BE ON RECORD SAYING THAT I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES THEY WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THIS ACTUAL SITUATION. THERE ARE NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THIS AFFECTS VERY FEW PEOPLE OUR HOPE IS IT WILL NOT AFFECT ANOTHER PERSON THIS BILL WOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE SO THAT PERSON IS NOT HARMED. THE SIXTEEN MILLION. I'D IF THAT IF THAT GENTLEMAN% KNOWS THAT THEY THIS BILL COST SOME SIXTEEN MILLION SINCE THEN HE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE UNDER PAYING PEOPLE AND THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS FIX IT NOW FIX IT YOU DON'T NEED THIS BILL TO FIX THAT PROBLEM. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WITH THAT I DO HAVE A AN AYE RECOMMENDATION ON THIS AND I THINK THAT IN THE DAY WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR PRESIDENT FUTURE RETIREES AS IN FORT. SO THAT SECTOR WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. HAVE A SECOND WITHOUT SURGERY CALDERON. HE MOTIONS TO PASS TO TO APPROPRIATIONS RODRIGUEZ. RODRIGUEZ I VOEPEL. WELL I CERVANTES. CERVANTES AYE COOLEY. AYE. COOLEY AYE COOPER. COOPER I FONG. FONG AYE O'DONNELL THANK. O'DONNELL AYE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR WILL THEY DIDN'T SEE YOU COME FORWARD. THE MOVE THE BILL. ALL RIGHT HE'S HERE TO PRESENT PHONE NUMBER SIX THAT'S J. R.. THREE WE LIKE TO SEE ALL RIGHT CENTER. BUT THEN WHEN YOU'RE READY IN THE P.. SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION THREE URGES CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO WHICH IS REPEAL THE GOVERNMENT PENSION OFFSET ALSO KNOWN AS THE GPO. AND THE WIND POLLINATION PROVISION WEB -- THESE ARE TO FEDERAL POLICIES THAT WHILE PERHAPS WERE WELL INTENTIONED APPROVING TOTALLY UNFAIR TO MANY PUBLIC SERVANTS THESE UPDATED POLICIES ARE HAVING A DENTAL EFFECT ON MANY HARD WORKING A PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SUCH TEACHERS. FIREFIGHTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IF AN IMP IF AN EMPLOYEE HAS WORKED IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTORS. THEY MAY HAVE PAID INTO BOTH SO SECURITY AND A SEPARATE GOVERNMENT PENSION. IN THE CASE IF THIS IS THE CASE THE WEAPONS SLASH AT PERSONS RIGHTFULLY EARNED SO SECURITY BY AT LEAST HALF. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S A FIREFIGHTER FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS AND HIS SOUL SECURITY. SLASH BY 90%. YEAH THE JEEP THE GPO IS SIMILAR IF SOMEONE IS PAID IN FULL SECURITY AND THEIR SPOUSE HAS PAID INTO SEPARATE GOVERNMENT PENSION THEY KNOW SO SECURITY BENEFITS ARE IN DANGER AS WELL. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT FAIR THERE'S NO REASON THE THESE PEOPLE SHOULD GET BACK THEY SHOULD GET BACK EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE PAID INTO. SO THIS IS SPECIALLY HARMFUL TO LOW INCOME WORKERS WHO ARE ALREADY A DISADVANTAGE. AND WHO RELY ON THESE BENEFITS AFTER THEY RETIRE. AND MANY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE THEY RETIRE. WHICH CAN CAUSE EXTREME FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR THOSE WHO DO KNOW BEFOREHAND THESE POLICIES WILL DISCOURAGE HIM FROM PURSUING BADLY NEED PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. LIKE TEACHING A PARTICULAR AIM CONCERNED ABOUT STEM EDUCATION AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THIS MAKES IT HARDER FOR OUR COUNTRY TO COMPETE ON AN AT INTERNATIONAL SCALE. SO IT'S WELL PAST TIME THAT THE CONGRESS DO THE RIGHT THING AND REPEAL BOTH THE GPO AND WEPT. AND ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND I WILL ALLOW YOU TO SELF THAN EVERYBODY THERE IS NO ISSUE THAT LIGHT IS OFTEN A PIE AND AND TESTIFIED SUPPORT THANK YOU GO AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION -- THIS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE TEACHING POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 72% OF WHICH ARE WOMEN AND WE'VE MADE IT -- EDUCATIONAL POLICY OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES TO SPECIFICALLY RY TO RECRUIT RETAIN TEACHERS AS A SECOND CAREER SPECIFICALLY IN STEM BUT THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET IS THAT WE HAVEN'T TOLD THEM CAST WHAT BY SERVING THE KIDS IN OUR STATE. YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PENALIZED WHEN YOU RETIRE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET CONGRESS. TO CHANGE THESE ACTIONS FOR A FEW DECADES NOW UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT ANY RESOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE ON WHICH PARTICULAR REALLY HARMFUL I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TO STRESS PHONE CALLS I GET FROM RETIREES -- ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE WOMEN IN THEIR SEVENTIES EIGHTIES NINETIES WHOSE SPOUSES JUST PASSED AND THEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THAT THEY WERE RELYING UPON -- WHEN THEIR SPOUSE PASS THEY FIND OUT ARE GOING TO BE EITHER REDUCE OR COMPLETELY ELIMINATED AND IN THAT THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT THIS HAS ON WOMEN WHO? STATISTICALLY LIVE LONGER THAN MEN HAVE BEEN RELIANT UPON THE INCOME THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO JUST HAVE IT RIPPED OUT FROM THEM IS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING UP FOR OUR POPULATION AND SINCE IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN OUR STATE. THAT THEN HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN IS LEADING TO A LOT OF THESE ELDERLY WOMEN BEING ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS SO THE SOONER THAT WE CAN GET CONGRESS. TO TAKE ACTION ON THIS ISSUE THE SOONER THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MORE STABLE ISIS SENIOR POPULATION. AND THAT'S MY CLUB. I WAS GOOD. WITH THE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

ANYONE ELSE SUPPORT HI GOOD MORNING MARIANNE ACTUALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM WERE ALSO VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. SEEN ON ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. QUESTION BY TWENTY ONE TWENTY MEMBERS -- SOME REMEMBER O'DONNELL. IT'S THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING -- THIS ITEM FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND AS A TEACHER I UNDERSTAND ITS IMPORTANCE -- BASICALLY I GET PENALIZED IRON SOCIAL SECURITY IN SOME OF THE EARLY YEARS IN FACT A MORNING IT NOW RIGHT. YET I PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE. A GOVERNMENT PENSION BUT ONLY FOR THAT TIME WHEN I WHEN I SERVED AS A TEACHER I THINK YOUR YOUR POINT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WITH REGARD TO PEOPLE. ENTERING THE TEACHING PROFESSIONAL PROFESSION LATER IN LIFE IS A GREAT ONE BECAUSE I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD OF PEOPLE WANT TO GO INTO TEACHING. AND THEN THEY LEARN ABOUT THE SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA LOSE THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY ESSENTIALLY -- AND IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DISINCENTIVE FOR MID CAREER INDIVIDUALS GOING TO THE TEACHING PROFESSION AND BRING THAT.
