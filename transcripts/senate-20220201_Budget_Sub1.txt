OKAY I THINK WE ARE WE THINK I'M AND YOU DIDN'T L. OKAY. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARLENE GARCIA AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME PRESENT BEFORE YOU TODAY. UP FIRST LET ME START BY THINKING OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THOSE OF YOU ON THE SUB COMMITTEE IN THE GOVERNOR FOR YOUR HISTORIC INVESTMENTS LAST YEAR AND EXPANDING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENTITLEMENT GRANTS. AND ADDRESSING THE- STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS. THIS ACTION ALONE PROVIDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW CAL GRANTS TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS LAST FALL WHO OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED TO GET CRACKED EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE FULLY ELIGIBLE. SOME OF THESE STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO. ACTIVE- AND WERE ABLE TO USE FOR BASIC- LIVING EXPENSES FOOD HOUSING AND OTHER SCHOOL EXPENSES. SO WE WERE REALLY THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TO SO MANY STUDENTS. WE HAVE LAID A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR FINANCIAL AID REFORM AND NOW WE ARE EAGER TO COMPLETE JOB BY IMPROVING THE CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK. THE GOVERNOR HAS LAID OUT A BOLD 70% COLLEGE ATTAINMENT GOAL AS PART OF HIS TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROPOSAL. CALGARY EQUITIES. TWO THIRTY THREE THAT GOAL. THE CALIFORNIA EQUITIES WILL PROVIDE A WORKABLE EQUITABLE FINANCIAL AID FORMULA THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOWER INCOME STUDENTS THIS FRAMEWORK IS VITAL TO MEET ATTAINMENT GOALS WHILE KEEPING STUDENTS ON A PATH TO GRADUATION WE KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO ATTAIN A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND- THE- BEST IN OUR INVESTMENTS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE'VE ALL SEEN THE HEADLINES IN HOME IT IN A MOMENT AMID COBIT NINETEEN. YES SIR TOO HIGH NOT TO AND IMPLEMENT THIS- EQUITY FRAMEWORK NOW OUR WORKFORCE AND OUR ECONOMY DESPERATELY NEED CALIFORNIA'S TALENT TRAINED AND SKILLED WORKERS READY TO THRIVE ARE FACING HUGE CHALLENGES AND ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PROLONGED AND PAINFUL PANDEMIC LET'S REMOVE FINANCIAL AID IS ONE OF THESE BARRIERS. LOW INCOME STUDENTS HAVE SO MANY COMPLEX ISSUES TO NAVIGATE INCLUDING AFFORDABILITY AND FINANCIALLY CAN GO A LONG WAY IN MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO SUCCEED. ROGER COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES THERE WAS CAL GRANT REFORM LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR WHO INDICATED IN HIS VETO MESSAGE THAT HE SUPPORTED. THE CONCEPT OF CAL GRANT REFORM AND MAKING IT EASIER FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS TO NAVIGATE THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS BUT THAT THIS WORK. WITHIN STATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD OFF OF LAST YEAR'S HISTORIC INVESTMENTS AND REMOVE THE REMAINING BARRIERS TO STUDENT ELIGIBILITY AS WE STREAMLINING VERY COMPLICATED PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA IS POISED TO TAKE CRITICAL ACTION THIS YEAR TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE NOT JUST FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS BUT OUR MIDDLE CLASS STUDENTS THIS IS A GAME CHANGER MOMENT FOR MOVING CLOSER TO SUPPORTING DEBT FREE COLLEGE AND INVESTING IN THE FUTURE TALENTS OF OUR STATE THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED RIGHT NOW. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR WE CAN TURN TO DRAG OUT BREMNER MY COLLEAGUE WHO CAN PROVIDE FULL DETAILS ON THE VARIOUS BUDGET ITEMS BEFORE YOU TODAY. WE ARE GOING TO GO TO MR BREMNER BUT I'VE A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH LEGISLATURE. POLLUTION THAT'S ON THE WALL BEHIND. WE ONLY. OKAY WAS LIKE RESOLUTION OF THIS LINE IS. I HAVE OPTED FOR BILL EISENBERG AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER ONE OVER HERE FROM SENATOR LOW INSTALLED. OKAY THAT TELLS ME A HOW LONG AGO YOU WERE RECOGNIZED I DON'T THINK SO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER EISENBERG IS BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX SO IT'S IT SHOULD BE. IN OTHER WORDS IT MEANS I'M PRETTY OLD. NO I'M SORRY ONLY YOU CAN SAVE LIKE THAT TO- COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF ALL FOR AND WE WANT TO MISTER BROWN. GOOD MORNING SURE LAYERED AND SENATORS IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU THIS MORNING I'M JAKE PREMIERE- DIRECTOR GOVERNMENT AND EXTERNAL REALLY. THE CALIFORNIA STREET. AND ALSO IT MIGHT TODAY BY JUST EXPANDING ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARCIA HEY- I'M HAPPY TO ALSO SHARE UPDATES ON A SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION- PROGRESS WE'VE MADE AROUND THE CALIBRATED TITLE MEANT THAT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OR CEO SPOKE TO FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM IN ITS REVISED STRUCTURE. BUT JUST TO BRIEFLY EXPAND ON THE POINTS AROUND OUR PROGRESS IN A FINANCIALLY EXPANSION AND REFORM. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER IN CREATING AFFORDABLE PATHWAYS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WE BUILT ON THAT WORK. LAST YEAR HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE APPS. SERVING STUDENTS. YOU'RE A MATERIALS A GREAT JOB AT. TO THE REMAIN CAPS IN ACCESS TO THE CAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS GEMMA. THE ADDITIONAL COME. IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. ANDWE KNOW THAT OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. ALSO LACK THE- ABILITY TO. FULLY ADDRESS FOR NON TUITION EXPENSES LIKE HOUSING FOOD TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND BOOKS AND OTHERS. WE DO NEED BELIEVE THAT PERSON TO ADDRESS AND WE'RE MOVING A BARRIERS TO ACCESS IN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM FOR ALL OF OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION. WE CAN BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM FROM LAST YEAR'S HISTORIC INVESTMENTS TO CAL GRANT PROGRAMS- AND WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO REMOVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THERE ARE STILL BARRIERS FOR OUR STUDENTS YOU ARE TRANSFERRING TO FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS OR WHO ENROLL AS FRESHMEN OUT OF FOR YOUR INSTITUTION. PERTAINING. ONE BEFORE IT PURSUE THEIR POST SECONDARY AND- ADDITIONALLY YOU REQUIRE TO PROVIDE. FOR GPA DATA KEEP OUT MANY OF OUR ADULT LEARNERS FROM ACCESSING CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY BASED ON THEIR INCOME. YEAH REQUIREMENTS ARE A RATIONING NEXT FOR STATE FINANCIAL. THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY EXCLUDES OR ADULT RETURNING LEARNERS DESPITE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROBABLY SERVING THE TOP 1100% OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AS CHANCELLOR WE SAYS. TOMGRAM ALSO CURRENTLY PERCENT MORE BUT MADE SPEND A STRAIGHTFORWARD PATHWAY TO AFFORDABLE. AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES WE HAVE EIGHT DIFFERENT CAL GRANT PROGRAMS CURRENTLY BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING THE OTHER NEWS SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS THAT. PART. THIS MAKES UNDER AND NOW THE CHALLENGING STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO MIGHT BE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE. THE SECOND IS REMOVING BARRIERS- BY STREAMLINING THE PROGRAM AND ESTABLISHING A CALGARY TO WORK COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT AND HOW FOR STUDENTS LOOKING HER DUTIES AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AS YOUR GENDER ALSO WANTED. I DON'T. I MEAN WE HAVE WE CAN MAKE HOW AND LIGHT OF LAST YEAR'S EXPAND AND BEES PROPOSED AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LA- TO A CALL ESTIMATE WHAT I CAN SHE. FULL TO ME. BRANCH FOR IN SUCH A WAY THAT ELIGIBILITY ON WITH THAT FOR THE PROGRAM FOR IT PROVIDES A SUPPORT TOWARDS POLITICS FOR STUDENTS WE CAN MAKE ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS FOR CAL EIGHT I'M MORE PRETTY. I NOTED WE ARE WORKING- DEPART OF FINANCE THE L. A. WOULD LIKE. BUDGET STAFF TO DEVELOP COST ESTIMATES FOR THAT PROPOSAL I CAN SHARE THAT THE INITIAL ESTIMATES SUGGEST THIS WOULD BE LIKELY IN THE- THE RANGER. CHIU HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PERHAPS MORE IN ONGOING ADDITIONAL FUNDS BEYOND THE CURRENT CALTRAIN APPROPRIATIONS. SO WITH THAT I WILL PAUSE THERE AND- WITH FORTY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT OUR PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE NEW FINANCIALLY EXPANSIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I WOULD COMMENT THAT. EARLY THE RESOLUTION THE WALL BEHIND YOU YET TO AND WE LOOK FOR TO LIKE THE IN AND WANT TO WRESTLE THAT SHOW- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO GABRIELA CHÁVEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. HI GOOD MORNING CHAIRED BASED AT THE RALLY CHAVEZ BUT THE POINT OF FINANCES. THE COCKRUM PROGRAM THE STATE'S LARGEST IN FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO SAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS IN TWENTY. TWO TWENTY THREE HE GLENDALE A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS NEARLY ONLY TO THE GULF. IS IN THE TWENTY. THE BUDGET ASSUMES FINANCIAL AID X. OF THREE POINT EIGHT. OF WHICH THREE FOUR BILLION SCORES A COMMON PROGRAM AND THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION I'M GOING TO GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE MIDDLE CLASS THE REVISED LAST PROGRAM HE- WE NEED TWENTY ONE BY TWO ACT WHICH EFFECT IN TWENTY. TO TWENTY. THE BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE LEARNING A LINE OF PEOPLE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES A TWO YEARS TOTAL OF. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE FUNDS. IN THE PROGRAM AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET I. THINK I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO LIESEGANG FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WELCOME TO SENATORS BEFITTING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS IN THIS ISSUE CARE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES SHARE THE COMPANY PROVIDES AT TOTAL FUNDING LEVEL OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION ON MINE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. NOT LINES. THE LAST LEGISLATURE AND SO WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED FUNDING LEVEL. BASED ON MOST RECENT BY THE BY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION THIS AMOUNT IS ENOUGH TO FIND AN ESTIMATED 24% OF THE TOTAL CALCULATED MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WORK SPEAKS. THIS PROGRAM IS TO BE IMPLEMENTATION IS PROVING TO BE COMPLEX. AND AT THIS POINT IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER WHAT AMOUNTS FOR STUDENTS WILL BE DETERMINED IN TIME FOR THEM TO RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION THIS SPRING. AFTER MAKING A CALLABLE DECISIONS. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. REGARDING THE GOVERNOR BUDGET INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT SAID INTENDED TO ALIGN THE PROGRAM'S FUNDING LEVEL. BUT THE MOST RECENT PAY FOR ESTIMATES FROM THE COMMISSION. EACH SPRING THE COMMISSION TYPICALLY OUT ITS INVESTMENT STRICKLAND WAS RECENT AVAILABLE PROGRAM DATA. AND IF YOU'RE NOT WILL INCLUDE RECENT DATA ON THE NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE EXPANDED RETIREMENT PROGRAM. I THINK I THINK THIS INFORMATION IS FORTHCOMING. WE RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE WAIT UNTIL THE NEAR VISION LANCASTER STATED BEFORE FINALIZING ANY CAL GRANT FUNDING DECISIONS. MY COMMENTS THIS FIRST ISSUE HERE THANK YOU HAVE TAKING QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM AND- OF AND I'M AND ASK A COUPLE OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE DECIDING WHETHER THEY WANT TO ASK AND- OF THE FIRST ONE ACTUALLY RELATES TO COMMENT AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S JUST MADE. BECAUSE LOCATION IS NOT JUST TO LOOK AT NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET BUT TO MONITOR THE IMPACT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGET. AND EVEN THOUGH. FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST JUST POINTED OUT THE OBVIOUS THAT DID SOME STATISTICS WON'T BE M. ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OF ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM UNTIL THE MAY REVISED I WAS GONNA ASK AT LEAST TO STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND OTHERS CAN COMMENT. ABOUT TO WHAT- WHAT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO IMPLEMENT IT HOW IT'S GOING IF YOU FEEL THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS. ARE JUST GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE TO IMPLEMENT THAT THUS FAR. AND I THINK WE'LL START WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KRISTA LOGICAL PERSON. WELL I WILL SAY THAT- IMPLEMENTATION- IN NOVEMBER OF THE REMAINING CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS WERE L. R. FOR THE ENTITLEMENT RECIPIENTS- THEY WERE INITIALLY- ELIGIBLE BUT NOT RECEIVING AWARDS AND IT DID TAKE A MAJOR EFFORT TO GET THAT DONE AND WHAT'S FOR US IS IT YOU KNOW THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. I BELIEVE THAT WE PLEASED WITH THE RESPONSE WITH THE NUMBER OF NEW AWARDS I GOT DISTRIBUTED AND SENT OUT TO THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES- BY NOVEMBER AND- SO FAR WE HAVE I THINK THAT THE PAID RATE IS STILL BEING PROCESS SO IT'S NOT A 100% YEAH BUT WE'RE REALLY WORKING ACTIVELY TO GET THAT PAID RATE TAKING CARE OF SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS. WE CAN PROVIDE THE DETAILS I'M PAID RATES AND- AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE ACTUALLY RECEIVED THEIR DISBURSEMENTS YOU MEAN YOU CAN NOW ONE I HELP THAT HAVE THAT DETAIL UNLESS MY COLLEAGUES- JAKE HAS THAT MOREOVER THE OTHER QUESTION IS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RATES AND- CHANGING RATES DISSENT MEAN THAT RETROACTIVE PAYMENTS IF THE RATES WERE IN PLACE BUT THEY WERE NOT REALIZED AS THEY STARTED THE SCHOOL YEAR. SO WHAT HAPPENS UNDER THE PREVIOUS- COMPETITIVE GRANT- WE HAD A POOL OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS. ARE JUST UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A CAL GRANT BUT THEY WERE PLACED IN THE COMPETITIVE POLE AND THEY'RE ONLY FORTY ONE THOUSAND AWARDS IN THAT COMPETITIVE POLE SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THERE'S ABOUT ONE IN EIGHT STUDENTS WHO WAS ELIGIBLE AND ACTUALLY GOT AN AWARD THE REMAINING STUDENTS DIDN'T GET. AWARDS INSTITUTE IF THEY HAD GPA THE AWARDS THAT ARE OFFERED TO THEM AND THE FINAL STEP IS FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY WALK INTO THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE AND PICK UP THEIR TAX. BILLS WILL BE CONSIDERED BURNER HAS HIS HAND UP BEFORE COLUMN YOU JUST SAID ONE THING. HE SAID IF THEY HAVE GPAS. DOES THAT MEAN IF THEY HAVE THEM AVAILABLE- IS THAT IT DOES THAT MEAN AND I'M SORRY THIS IS THE- SPECIAL INTERESTS QUESTION FROM SOMEBODY THAT WENT TO A GRADE LAW SCHOOL. IF YOU WANT TO A PASS NO CREDIT SCORE AND YOU HAVE NO GRIP. DO NOT QUALIFY FOR GRANT. I THAT'S A TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT I KNOW I KNOW YOU WILL QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANTS BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DETERMINE THE GPA AND I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS. BUT I WILL SAY THAT THIS GPA REQUIREMENTS PARTICULARLY A FAX ADULT LEARNERS PEOPLE GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL FOR YEARS AND THEY HAVE TO GO BACK TO THEIR HIGH SCHOOL AND- PULL UP THE GPA TRANSCRIPT THAT IS. KIND OF IRRELEVANT TO WHO THEY ARE AND- TODAY AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE PROJECT. IS IN THE GROUND. BIRTHDAY CAL EQUITIES FRAMEWORK TO ELIMINATE THE GPA FOR A STATE THAT BE A RELEVANCE. FACTOR IN DETERMINING- ON WEEKENDS. YOU CAN REPORT TO ME OFF TO THE SIDE. AFTERWARDS IF YOU DISCOVER THAT AND- AND I AM A VERY CONSERVATIVE ALUMNI AND SO. IT TURNS OUT THAT. I OPPOSED TO GRADES BEING GIVEN WHEN THE- ACADEMIC SENATE VOTED ON IT HIGHLIGHTED CAMPAIGN TO DO THAT SO. MUCH I THINK SAWYER YES MR BREMNER YOU'RE. ARE PATIENTLY BEEN WAITING. THANK YOU SAN AND I CAN ANSWER A COUPLE THOSE POSH TO BED TIME YOU JUST HEAD ON. ALL FIRST JUST CHIME IN THIS CALL ABOUT. THIS IN A HURRY WHEN WHICH STUDENTS ARE SEEKING CAL GRANT BUT MIGHT NOT HAVE WHAT WE CALL A CAL GRANT ELIGIBLE GPA TO SUBMIT THERE IS A PROCESS THROUGH WHICH STUDENTS CAN SUBMIT A TEST SCORE IN LIEU OF GPA. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HOME SCHOOL STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR UTILIZED CURRENTLY- WHAT I WILL SURE THERE IS THAT OF COURSE. TAKING ONE OF THE TESTS THAT QUALIFY WHICH ARE ARE ACTIVELY DEAN- ELIMINATED AS AS PIECES FOR CONSIDERATION FOR ADMISSIONS TWO OR FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT TYPICALLY DOES RETURNING ADULT LEARNERS AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARCIA SPOKE TO YOU. I'M NOT DONE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT TEST SCORES. AB THAT STORY A BARRIER THOSE TWO BUT TO GET TO OTHER AROUND HOW MANY HAVE WE CURRENTLY WHAT IS TO THE NEW COLLEGE ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SHARE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE. SOME MORE SPECIFICS ON WHAT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARCIA SPOKE TO YOU IN NOVEMBER IN OUR FIRST ROUND OF PROCESSING THESE AWARDS WE SENT OFFERS FOR CALIFORNIA WARTS YOU OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARCIA NOTED- THIS REALLY REPRESENTED STUDENTS WHO WOULD NOT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN. AL PORTION AND THEN WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN CAN. TO BE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT. THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE PREDICTABLE ACCESS GIVEN ITS IMPACT. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MANY STUDENTS WOULD HAVE RECEIVED AWARDS UNDER THE FORMER SYSTEM AND HOW MANY STUDENTS WERE INSTEAD OFFERED IN NOVEMBER THAT YIELDS WHAT LOOKS LIKE A NET INCREASE OF ABOUT NINETY FOUR THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS OFFERED A CALTRAIN AWARD. BECAUSE OF ACTIONS TAKEN LAST YEAR BY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR SO THAT IS JUST- SOMETHING WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION I'M ALSO PLEASED TO REPORT THAT IN THE PROCESS OF. CONTINUOUSLY PROCESS. THAT'S WORKING. IS PROVIDED BY THE STUDENT THEIR CAP FINANCE AID OFFICE. ANOTHER FOR THOUSAND OFFERS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE DELIVERED IN JANUARY ON TOP OF THE PREVIOUS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT I MENTION. THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC ISSUES I CAN SHARE IN TERMS OF HOW STUDENTS THAT ACTUALLY GET PAID THEIR WORK AND THIS IS A CAMPUS BASED PROCESS. ONCE THEY'VE BEEN OFFERED THEIR WORK BY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION- BUT AGAIN THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WOULD TYPICALLY HAPPEN WITH A COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. AS AWARDS WERE BEING RECYCLED TO OTHER STUDENTS AS THE INITIAL OFFER STUDENT WASN'T BEING PAID THEIR WORK SO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BUT ONE OF THIS YEAR AND THE REALLY GOOD NEWS ABOUT HOW MANY ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WERE ABLE OFFERED AWARD THIS YEAR. BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT AND EXPANSION. MADE IN LAST YEAR'S. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COM THAT TO. HELP IN. A AND FOR THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THEN MR BREMNER. LET ME ASK THE SAME THING ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. OF THE IN TERMS OF- WHAT STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN TO IMPLEMENT IT AND WHAT- YOU KNOW THUS FAR- FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION AND ANY CHANGE IN THE PROGRAM OR ANY PROBLEMS AND WE'LL START WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THEN I WILL GO TO MISTER BREMER. AFTER THAT. SO WE HAVE STARTED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SEGMENTS TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS AS WE KNOW THEM IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FROM LAST FROM LAST. AND WE BEGUN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS WOULD WORK IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS BECAUSE THERE IS AN OVERLAY WITH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS SO IT'S MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PLUS. IN THE CURRENT MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THAN THE ELIGIBLE CAL GRANT SEASONS ARE THE ONES WHO GET AWARDS AND NOW WITH THE NEW MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP- UC AND CSU STUDENTS. WHO WHO- RECEIVER CAL GRANT AS WELL AS STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THE FAMILIES EARNING LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE SO IT'S BEEN GREATLY EXPANDED. SO THE DETAILS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW YOU ACTUALLY DETERMINE THAT CUSTOMER TENDONS BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS BASED ON. THE COST OF ATTENDANCE AND THAT THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WOULD BE THEIR LAST DOLLAR IT. STUDENT. SENATE OFFICERS WOULD- ADDRESS THE- FINANCIAL. PROGRAMS THAT STUDENTS ARE. FOR PACKAGES AND WHATEVER REMAINS THAT'S WHERE THE STATE WOULD COME IN AND USE MIDDLE CLASS ADULTS SCHOLARSHIP TO CLOSE THE UNMET NEED GAP. AND AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE FUNDING LEVEL THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED WE CAN CLOSE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. OF THAT OF THE UNMET NEED GAP. AND AND THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN. IMPLEMENT SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY. WE'VE YOU GO TO THE L. A- THING WHEN YOU SAY YOU CAN MEET TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. OF THE UNMET NEED GAP. DOES IT MEAN THERE 76% UNDERDRESSED AT THAT POINT. THE FUNDING WOULD COVER CORRECT IT'S ONLY THAT THE CURRENT FUNDING IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH COVER APPROXIMATELY 24% OF WHAT WE ANTICIPATE THE FULL COST OF IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM OVERSEE YOU KNOW SEVERAL YEARS AND WHEN YOU SAY THE FULL COST OF IMPLEMENTING THAT'S REALLY STAFF. AND THAT'S WITH THIS ITEM MORE TALK ABOUT RIGHT WERE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE N THE COSTS OF IMPLEMENTATION. ARE NOT BUYING A DRESS STORE BY THE BUDGET. WELL THE STAFFING THIS IS ISSUE I'M REFERRING TO BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP CRAFT FENDI. HASH IN THE GRANT TO PASS A WRECKED ASSISTANCE. CORRECT THAT'S WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU TO NOW OKAY JUST TRYING TO CLEAR THAT UP BUT I INTERRUPTED YOU WHEN YOU WERE GOING TO GO ON TO SOMETHING ABOUT THE L. A. O. RIGHT THE L. A. O. POINTED OUT THAT. THERE ARE SOME YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT COMPLEXITIES WITH IMPLEMENTATION THAT WE'RE REALLY STARTING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. AND WE THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN REALLY STREAMLINED SO THAT WE CAN GET THE FUNDS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS ARE IN DIRE NEED NOW. SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT VARIOUS OPTIONS- PROBABLY TWO OF THE MOST COMPLEX ISSUES THAT WE THINK WARRANT SOME CONSIDERATION AND WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS QUESTION. CLEAN OF LEADS SENATE STAFF. REALLY GET SOME INPUT. SHE ALL ONE- RIGHT NOW MIDDLE CLASS. REQUIRES THAT THIS BE THE LAST DOLLAR TO PROVIDE IN THE STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE. THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT AND THE SEGMENTS HAVE REALLY SPOKEN OUT QUITE A BIT IT'S MUCH EASIER TO IMPLEMENT IT. AS PART OF THE OVERALL PACKAGING SO THAT YOU CAN KIND OF RELY ON THE SPECIFIED AMOUNT. BECAUSE LAST DOLLAR THAT AMOUNT VARIES IT'S A MOVING TARGET. AND SO WHAT ARE THE IDEAS TO MAKE IT EASIER AND STAFF NOT JUST FOR THE- BUT ALL. FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATORS EMPLOY. A SEAMLESS WAS BE TO MAKE AN EARLY THEN TO ALSO HAVE A DEFINED. THAT YOU COULD GO BACK INTO YOUR PACKAGING SO ARE TWO ISSUE THAT WE REALLY. BUDGET CONTINUE JUST AND HEAR FROM THE ARCHITECTS OF THE PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE SEGMENTS IN TERMS OF AN IMITATION WERE PREPARED TO FACILITATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS- OKAY SO WE'VE ALREADY STARTED BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE ZEROING IN ON. THANK YOU ARMINA ASK MR BREMNER FEW HAS ANYTHING TO ADD AND WHEN HE'S DONE I'M GONNA GO TO THAT COLAIO TO SEE IF SHE HAS ANY COMMENTS SINCE OF THE L. A. O. WAS REFERENCED IN YOUR COMMENTS MR BREMNER. THANK YOU SENATOR AND ALL ALL DOES OFFER SOME BRIEF ADDITIONAL DETAIL TO ALL THE POINTS THAT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OR CEO JUST LAID OUT BUT I THINK REALLY REFLECT WHERE WE ARE IMPLEMENTATION AND SOME OF THE KEY CHALLENGES- THAT WERE CONSIDERING TRYING TO WORK THROUGH WITH OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS- AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NOTED WEEK WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A WORKGROUP WITH ARE YOU SEE AND SEE IF YOU COLLEAGUES TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO SUCCESSFULLY IN. THIS PROGRAM. THE OTHER KEY PIECE THAT'S BEEN TAKING PLACE SINCE THE- REGULATORS. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE L. A. O. AND SEEKING ADDITIONAL- STATEMENT DATA ABOUT HOW THEIR INSTITUTIONAL AID FUNCTIONS THAT USE IN CSU. BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TOTAL COST FOR IMPLEMENTING THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM GIVEN THIS STRUCTURE COULD BE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SPOKE TO WHERE IT'S A PROGRAM THAT NOW LOOKS AT TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WANTS TO BE LAST DOLLAR AND SIT ON TOP OF ALL OTHER FORMS OF. FINANCIAL AID AND ALSO PROVIDES AWARDS TO STUDENTS BASED ON THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION- THOSE ARE THE KEY DATA POINTS THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY HOW MUCH EACH STUDENT COULD EXPECT TO RECEIVE. WE NEED TO KNOW THE TOTAL COST I'M INTERACTION. FINDING CREATED FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND ALL THE OTHER FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID TO EACH OF THOSE NEW STUDENT RECIPIENTS WOULD RECEIVE. SO IN LATE DECEMBER WE DID- SHARE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALEJO- WHAT THE UPDATED COST ESTIMATES LOOKS LIKE BASED ON THE ADDITIONAL DATA THAT WE RECEIVE FROM YOU SEEN CSU- AND WE THEN SAW ON JANUARY TENTH OF COURSE THE FUNDING AMOUNT THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM PROPOSED TOWARD THIS PROGRAM. IT DIDN'T REFLECT THE AGREEMENT FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACTIVE NEGOTIATION. AND WE STILL ARE RECEIVING APPLICATIONS FOR STATE FINANCIAL AID. MARCH SECOND I'M MORE THAN WE WILL UNDERSTAND HOW MANY STUDENTS DO YOU SEE IN CS YOU HAVE APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID AND CAN BE. CONSIDERED FOR A CALTRAIN WORK. BUT I CAN SHARE IN TURN OF SOME OF DATA- OR CALL THE WE SET THAT LA SPOKE TO THIS A LITTLE. THE TOTAL FOR HIM. WE ASSESSED TO BE TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THAT FULL AWARD AMOUNT THAT SITS ON TOP OF OTHER FORMS OF BAY AND THEN COVERS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. THAT WOULD SERVE AS THE AGENDA MATERIALS LIKE LEAVING OUT OVER THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND STUDENTS SO A MUCH LARGER PROGRAM. AND IT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY AND WE CAN PRESS COME BACK TO THAT IN JUST. A STATE IN. THIS PROGRAM. I DON'T THINK 8% THOSE TO WOULD BE C. S. MISTER. TO FORTY DOLLARS. BALANCE THE OTHER 32% ARE AT THE UC- ABOUT A HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT WOULD STAND TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WORD. OF THE TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AN APPROPRIATION ABOUT 38% WOULD GO TO THE NEW SEAT. OUR STUDENTS- TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY TO. SIXTY TWO PERCENT- WERE ABOUT THREE OR NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WILL GO TOWARDS THE ISSUE STUDENTS. WE ALSO IN PROVIDING ESTIMATE ESTIMATED. AN INCOME BASED ANALYSIS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW MUCH OFAN AWARD WOULD GO TO STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR FAMILY INCOMES AND MADE SURE THAT DATA WITH. BERMAN FINANCING COMMITTEE STAFF THAT THEY HAVE THAT AVAILABLE AS WELL I'M AND THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING AS YOU CONSIDER PERHAPS MAKING REFINEMENTS TO THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE ON THIS PROGRAM SUCH THAT IT WOULD BE A- FIRST DOLLAR AND TO FIND AWARD AMOUNT. FOR DIFFERENT STUDENT POPULATIONS YOU CAN EXPECT TO BE OUR POLICYMAKERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE AWARD FOR STUDENTS OF VARIOUS INCOME. CATEGORIES THANK YOU FOR THOSE CA THEY'RE HELPFUL AND LET ME ASK WITH THE KING. SHE HAS ANY COMMENT GIVEN THE REFERENCES TO THE L. A- THAT HAPPENED IN THESE. DANCERS TO THESE QUESTIONS. THANK RIGHT RECALL EXACTLY COMMISSION HAVE. PROVIDED SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ON BOTH THE COST ESTIMATE IN TWO OF THE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES BETTER LEADING. TO THE DIFFICULTY IN ESTIMATING A STUDENT'S AWARD AMOUNT BUT THE CURRENT AVAILABLE INFORMATION. I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE ASPECTS YEAH SHE'LL. IF WE WANT CLASS SCHOLARSHIP TO EXPAND ACCESS IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO STUDENTS ABOUT HOW MUCH FINANCIAL AID IS AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND IT'S NOT CLEAR MESSAGING THAT LEADS TO OUR INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE ABOUT DETERMINING A STUDENT'S AWARD AMOUNT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION HERE IN THE SPRING AS THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT MOMENT FOR THE. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARM I'M GONNA TO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF SENATOR MEN AND THEN- WHEN HE'S DONE IT SENATOR- TROUBLED HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR WILL GO TO HER SENATOR MAN. I THANK YOU CENTER CAROL AIRD- AND THANK YOU TO THE WITNESSES FOR YOUR- VERY ELIMINATING TESTIMONY. I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON AND CAL GRANT REFORM. AND- YOU KNOW I KNOW YEAH I WAS A PROFESSOR BEFORE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE AND I KNOW. IN TALKING MY STUDENTS HOW DIFFICULT IT HAS BEEN FOR THEM TO ACCESS FINANCIAL AID HOW COMPLICATED IS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BOTH IN THE L. A. R. O. REPORT- AS WELL AS AS SOME OF THE OTHER MATERIALS- WE RECEIVED AND ALSO I THINK IN IN SEVERAL YOUR TESTIMONIES. IT'S I GUESS MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE SCALE- WITH WHICH THIS COMPLEXITY IS A PROBLEM LIKE IN OTHER WORDS- HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE PREVENTEDEVERYTHING FROM ACCESS AND CAL GRANT WE HAVE SOME SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM. AND DO WE HAVE. IT IDENTIFY RECORD. MEANS TO REDUCE THIS COMPLEXITY. THERE'S STREAMLINING OR OTHERWISE- YOU KNOW SO I GUESS THAT THAT WOULD BE MY QUESTION I THINK FOR C. SACK AND THEN AND PERHAPS FOR ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO TAKE ON THAT QUESTION. LET'S GO TO- I'LL TAKE A STAB AT THAT QUESTION- REALLY THE COMPLEXITY OF NAVIGATING THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IS REALLY ONE OF THE CORE PRINCIPLES BEHIND CAL GRANT REFORM AND WHAT LED US TO- DOING THE WORK IT WAS A OF ONE YEAR WORK GROUP THAT WE CONVENE LOOKING AT ALL THE OBSTACLES FOR STUDENTS. YOU ACCESS FINANCIALLY AND IT IS DEFINITELY A BARRIER PARTICULARLY FOR FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME SO SPINELLI. AND SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE GUYS PRINCIPLE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS A USER FRIENDLY THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE FOR VERY DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC AND OVER THE YEARS. WE ADDED A LOT OF LAYERS TO THE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS VARIOUS MEANS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REDESIGN THE CAL GRANT BASED ON TODAY'S STUDENTS NEEDS SO THAT'S WHY WE TAKE EIGHT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE NOW. AND WE REALLY NARROW IT DOWN TO TWO PROGRAMS CAL GRANT TO FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH ONE SET OF ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND CAL GRANT FOR FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS AND ONE SET OF ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. RIGHT NOW IT STUDENT APPLIES FOR FINANCIAL AID THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHICH OF THE EIGHT PROGRAMS ARE PLANNED FOR ALL WITH DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. AND WHAT ONE OF BUT WE'RE REALLY HOPING TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK IS THAT WE EMPOWER STUDENTS AND FAMILIES NO I'M APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID THIS IS WHAT I'M APPLYING FOR HERE ARE THE REQUIREMENTS. AND TO BE ABLE TO BE INTENTIONAL IN THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS WHEN THEY DECIDE TO GO TO COLLEGE ABOUT WHAT THE COST OF GOING TO COLLEGE ARE SO THAT'S A HUGE PART OF OPENING ACCESS. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE FAMILIES THAT RULE THEM. THIS THEY'RE NOT BELIEVE WILL GOAL. WAY IN THEM ARMENIAN WITH THE IN. EARLY ON THAT SAY. GET HAVING TO EVENTUALLY A LOOK UP TABLE THAT SAYS I MAKE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY. THEREFORE I AM ELIGIBLE FOR THIS AMOUNT OF SPENDING AND WE THINK THAT'LL BE POWERFUL FOR THOSE FIRST GENERATION FAMILIES AND THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS START LIMIT LET ME REPHRASE THAT BECAUSE MAYBE I DO IT WILL- X. A WELCOME BACK ON TWENTY TWENTY YOU'RE THE TYPE- I GUESS I WAS LIKE WHAT IS THE FOR LIKE I GUESS THESE PROPOSALS- ONE WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE FACING WE HAVE ANY DATA ON LIKE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S QUALITATIVE OR QUANTITATIVE- YOU KNOW I CLEARLY THE PROBLEM AND JUST TRY TO GET A SENSE OF LIKE. DO WE KNOW HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS TO INTERVIEWS WITH STUDENTS THROUGH SURVEYS- AND THEN SECONDARILY- TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU PROPOSED THESE REFORMS TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THESE FORMS BE ARE THE OTHER. AND WHY NOT SAY MORE INCREMENTAL OR MAYBE MORE BOLD REFORMS- YOU KNOW THE SO THAT WOULD BE REALLY IS THE CORE THE QUESTION. I'LL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE JAKE WHO HAS THE DATA. CAN SHOW WHO WHO'S NOT GETTING AN AWARD THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD GET IN A WORD AFTER CAL GRANT. REFORM. SENATOR MAN I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY WHAT DRIVES OUR WORK AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AROUND PURSUING REFORM AND STREAMLINING AND THE ELIMINATION OF ERRORS ON THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WHAT WE MOST RECENTLY ASSESSED EVEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HISTORIC EXPANSION WE MADE LAST YEAR AND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATEMENT AROUND PATRICK REFORM WE WERE DOING. GREAT YOU HELP BRING. CLEANLY ALIVE WITH THE STANDARDS FOR THE NEW FOR PELL GRANT IT WILL BE A PICTURE WEEK. WE COULD SERVE AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE THEY EITHER FACE BARRIERS BASED ON. WHEN THEY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL THE AGE AT WHICH THEY TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION OR A GPA IN TRANSCRIPT REQUIREMENTS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDENTS AND EVEN FURTHER. I'M CALLS US TO ACTION THESE ARE DISPROPORTIONATE PROPORTIONATELY ARE BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS WHO ARE MOST OFTEN CAPPED OUT OF FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE OF THESE NON FINANCIAL- RATIONALE MACINNES OWNS THAT WE UTILIZE IN FINANCIALLY CURRENTLY. AND THEY'RE ALSO- STUDENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE FAMILY RESOURCES TO CALL ON TO HELP THEM PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION. SO WE HAVE OUTLINED THE A STRIP. TO PULL. OF A DRESSING NOT ONLY. YOURS CHOOSE TO MILLEDGEVILLE PREDICTABLE ACCESS TO CAL GRANT BUT ALSO ADDRESSING- HAS. MADE THIS CHANGES. WHICH MAKES SENSE VERY AFFECT JOB COVERAGE WE SHOULD. WE KNOW AND WE HEAR FROM STUDENTS I'VE EVER DAY OF THE CHANNEL POSED. INTERFACE ME FOOD AND HOUSING. WE ALSO SEE DATA THROUGH MARCH PROCESS THAT YOU NEED COMMISSION THEY REALLY INDICATES HOW WIDELY FELT THIS PROBLEM IS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE SURVEYED STUDENTS EVEN BEFORE THE ONSET COVE IN NINETEEN ONE OUT OF THREE STUDENTS WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY WERE FOOD INSECURE ANOTHER ONE OUT OF THREE STUDENTS INDICATE THAT ARE HOUSING INSECURE. AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE GATHERED IN THE TIME SINCE THEN. IT HAS CONTINUE TO SERVE TO. ABOUT HOW THEY DEALING WITH THE CAN DOWN. INCREASED COSTS THAT THERE WERE TO US. WEEK THE STUDENTS ARE SAYING THEIR FOOD HOUSING EXPENSES ARE ONLY GONNA. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WHEN YOU LOOK TO BREAK THAT DOWN BAY. INCOME THEIR RACE ETHNICITY. ALWAYS COMES TO WHO ARE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF THAT THERE OF THE UP AND IT'S OUR AND LATINOS WERE. SAYING THAT THEIR COSTS HAVE GONE UP SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE PREDICTABLE ACCESS TO STATE FINANCIAL AID. BUT THE STATE ON COURSE TO REAL. WISHING ALL OUR STUDENTS. ARE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND ELSE WHICH TO COME. ALL RIGHT I HAD A SECOND QUESTION- SO. THIS I THINK IT'S TO DIRECTORS IS COMMON. IN TESTING- YOU KNOW FOURTEEN SAID I WAS PROUD BE COOPER THAT- AND I DIDN'T THAT THE GO. DID IN HIS HEAT MESSAGE TALK THE NEED TO CONSIDER THIS IS PART THE BUDGET BY HE ALSO X. THAT- ANOTHER KEY READ. ONE FIFTY SIX WERE HIS BELIEF I PRESUME IN FOR BY ANALYSIS THE X. BRANCH THAT- THIS WOULD RESULT IN UNTENABLE COST PRESSURES TO THE STATE- DO YOU STILL THINK THAT THIS IS TRUE- AND IF NOT SORT OF WHAT'S CHANGE THAT THAT MIGHT- YOU KNOW. ESSENTIALLY WITH THEIR FARMS HERE LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONES PROPOSING FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX INSIDERS WONDERING SIR WHAT WHAT WHAT THE REASON FOR THE CHANGES OTHER THAN THE BUDGET PROCESS BECAUSE- OUT YOU KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR SIGNIFICANT CAUGHT. LAST YEAR I AM NOT SURE YOU MEAN. I THINK THERE ARE TWO ISSUES. THAT THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS ONE IS- THIS YOU NEED COMMISSION AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF DATA THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH IN TERMS OF WHAT I BELIEVE THE COST PRESSURE WORK WE HAVE- TO COME AND HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT COST PRESSURE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING. OTHER THE LAST. REALLY A LINE ON THE COSTS PRESSURES TO START WITH A THE SAME- BASED WEIGHT COSTS AND- AND SO WE'VE DONE THAT AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE TO PASS CATCHERS THAT- JAKE EARLIER BUT IT IS. SOMETHING THAT WERE IN LINE WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE BELIEF THAT. THEY AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX THE BIGGEST COST PRESSURE OF AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX REALLY WAS CAL GRANT IN TITLE MEANT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. SO WHEN THAT WILL BE DRESSED IN THE BUDGET YEAH REALLY JUST LEFT THE REMAINING COMPACT AND PULL FOR THE FOR INSTITUTIONS EIGHTEEN. AND STREET WHO IS A TEN COLLEGE BEYOND WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IF THEY'RE GOING TO YOU THE CSU. CALLER HE TO THAT COMPARE PULL SOME TO THE CALL COMPETITORS PULL ALBEIT AS LONG AS IT WOULD READ THOSE BARRIERS BRING THEM INTO THE ENTITLEMENT MIX AS WELL SO THAT ALL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU DECIDE TO START COLLEGE AT TWENTY TWO MORE THAN A YEAR OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO COMPETE FOR A VERY LIMITED PULL CAL GRANT SHE WOULD GET A CAL GRANT. SO THOSE COSTS. IN THE WAY. TO YOUR MANAGE THESE COSTS AND- BUT AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDE THE PREDICTABILITY AND THE ASSURANCE TO FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR BUT LOW INCOME STUDENTS. IN ALL OVER ALL THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE AND THIS IS WHAT IT COSTS. BUT BUT WE ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS WE ARE TRYING TO TALK THROUGH THOSE COST PRESSURES. MICHELLE BY. UNITA CHAVEZ YEAH EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME WE HAVE A HAND FROM SOMEBODY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO LET ME GO TO REBEKAH KIRK. I THINK SHE'S GOING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION GOT SERVICE THANK. SHARE REBEKAH KIRK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM JUST WANTING CHECK TO CLARIFY WE ARE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION ABOUT THE MOST RECENT PROPOSAL HOWEVER WE'VE NOT YET SEEN. ANY DETAIL OR SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FOR THIS YEAR'S VERSION OF THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE NOT YET HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE DETAILS OR TO CONDUCT OUR OWN FISCAL ANALYSIS AND WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED AT THIS. I WOULD JUST. SPEAKING HAS THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS AN ENTITLEMENT AND EXPANSION OF ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS BEYOND WHAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN AS A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT AT THE EXPANSION IN TITLE MEANT CAN BE CONSIDERABLY COSTLY. THERE'S ALSO A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY INVOLVED BECAUSE IT IS AN ENTITLEMENT EVEN IF THERE IS A PROJECTED COST AT A CERTAIN LEVEL THAT CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AS CASELOAD INCREASES OR DECREASES OVER TIME SO FROM FROM THE FINANCE PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THE EXPANDING ENTITLEMENTS AS ALWAYS A SOMEWHAT RISKY AND A CONCERN FOR US BECAUSE IT LIMITS BUDGETARY FLEXIBILITY AS WELL AS PRESENTS SOME FINANCIAL LIABILITY INTO IF YOU PLAN ON GOING. I THAT SENTIMENT A QUICK FOLLOW UP I DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF LIKE WHAT THE ONGOING. LIABILITIES ARE LIKELY TO BE. ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS. I'M I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE THAT STUDENT COMMISSION IS PREPARED TO ADDRESS FROM A FINANCE PERSPECTIVE WE CAN NOT BECAUSE WE'VE NOT YET SEEN A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL ON HOW TO OPPORTUNITY- REVIEW. OUR ESTIMATE COSTS. I WOULD TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE JAKE YOU SENATOR AND I'LL JUST OFFER AN INITIAL PROJECTION WE ARE AS I NOTED EARLIER STILL WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LA AND TO REFINE A MORE PRECISE COST ESTIMATE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT OUR CURRENT STUDENT ENROLLMENT PATTERNS PARTICIPATION IN THE CURRENT CAL GRANT TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE AS WELL AS WOULD BE OUT YOUR COST PRESSURES WOULD LOOK LIKE. PROGRAM. BUT I CAN SHARE LIKELY BE. IN THE RANGE UP HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONGOING FOR MORE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A CALTRAIN TO ACCELERATE FOR THE CLEANLY ALIGNED WITH THE ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS FOR THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM. OF COURSE AS THIS PROCESS MOVES FORWARD. ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE AND HER COLLEAGUES AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR HE COULD REFINE THE POLICY FRAMEWORK. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS ABOUT THE DESIRE OF OUR POLICY MAKERS BUT WE DO GET THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION BELIEVE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BARRIERS TO REMOVE. AND THAT ALIGNING THESE TWO PROGRAMS WITH THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT WILL ALLOW US AS A STATE TO SEND A CRYSTAL CLEAR MESSAGE TO OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ALL OF THE FINANCIAL AID THAT THEY WOULD. WORK GOT IT I APPRECIATE THE THAT'S A HELPFUL NOW BEFORE CLOSE TO SEE WHAT THAT IS- OBVIOUSLY WANT TO BE FISCALLY PRUDENT THAT THAT BEING SAID I WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I SUPPORTED AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX TO BEGIN WITH THIS- MY- STRONG BELIEF THAT. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS PAY OFF. YOU KNOW INCREDIBLE RETURNS OVER THE LONG RUN. AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS IN MY VIEW- THE CALIFORNIA'S BEEN SO RESILIENT THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. AND THIS RECESSION THAT HAS HIT A LOT OF STATES REALLY HARD. EYES BECAUSE OF OUR STRONG WORK FORCE AND THE ROLE OF OUR- HIRED SYSTEM IN PREPARING OUR WORKFORCE. AS A THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU SENATOR MENSEN ROADSHOW BOAT. THANK YOU SENATOR LETTERED AND- THANK YOU FOR THE LINE OF QUESTIONING THAT BOTH OF YOU HAVE- GIVEN THIS- THIS MORNING AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE- FOR WITNESSES THIS MORNING AND COMING BACK I'M VERY EXCITED TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU THIS YEAR ONCE AGAIN- LET ME JUST BEGIN BY- SITTING HERE AND JUST REALLY REALLY. READING HERE JUST FOR THE RECORD AND I THINK IT'S SUPPORT FOR THE PUBLIC TO NOTE. AND WHERE WE ARE AT THAT TIME STUDENT DEBT IN CALIFORNIA IS A TWENTY TWENTY. SAYS THAT THE STUDENTS THAT ATTEND CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST DEBT IN THE NATION UPON GRADUATION. AND IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT IN NINETEEN NINETY. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND 2046% OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GRADUATES HAVE A STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AND THE AVERAGE LOAN DEBT OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GRADUATE. IN NINETEEN TWENTY TO TWENTY NINETEEN I'M SORRY TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. WAS TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE. PLACING THE STATE THIRD LOWEST IN THE NATION ON THIS MEASURE- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF I MEAN IT I KNOW THAT WE STILL HAVE SOME CHALLENGES. WE'LL FOR. MAKING COLLEGE- MORE AFFORDABLE FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD PROGRESS I THINK IN A VERY POSITIVE PERSPECTIVE IN MY OPINION. ON THAT AND I THINK IT- WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE AND ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN COMMENDED. THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED- MADE AN EFFORT TO CREATE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE IN THIS CALIFORNIA. SO ON THAT- I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE- MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP- WHAT ARE THE OVERALL DIFFERENCES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS AND THE NEW VERSIONS OF. OF THIS GRANT AND THEN FROM THERE. AB I'M GOING TO WANT O KNOW. IF- THE C. S. A. C. I BELIEVE THAT ANY STATURE TERRY STATUTORY CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM IN EMPLOYMENT IN THE CHANGES. I THINK WE'LL GO TO WHO ARE WITH GOING TO ASK WHICH ONE AND THAT ANSWERS THIS QUESTION MR BREMNER HAS HIS HAND UP SO LET'S GO TO HIM. SURE AND SENATOR THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM IN A COUPLE OF KEY- REGARDS. THE FIRST IS THAT THE- CURRENT MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THAT WE'RE PAYING OUT THIS YEAR. IS STILL ONE THAT'S BASED ON COVERING UP PERCENTAGE OF TUITION. FOR STUDENTS THAT DO NOT RECEIVE A CAL GRANT. SO THAT'S A SMALLER UNIVERSE OF TOTAL STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE. AND IT'S- I NEVER WANED RANGE AND THE TYPES OF AWARDS THAT WE PROVIDE TO STUDENTS. AGAIN JUST BASED ON THAT PERCENTAGE OF TUITION COVERAGE FOR NON CALTRAIN RECIPIENTS. AND THE NEW STRUCTURE BEEN. HELLO THE GOVERNOR'S. WE WOULDN'T BE SERVED ALL AND FAMILIES HELLO CERTAIN INCOME BUT A RECEIPT CALTRAIN OR NOT. AND THE TARGET OF THE AWARD WOULD BE. UNMET NEED FOR A STUDENT TO COVER THEIR TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AFTER FACTORING IN THE OTHER FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID FOR WHICH THEY QUALIFY. A STUDENT CONTRIBUTION THAT'S CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS FOR FAMILIES WITH INCOMES OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ADDITIONAL PARENTAL CONTRIBUTION. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL METRICS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE AND HOW WE DO THIS AT THIS DO NEED COMMISSION AND IDENTIFY THE AWARD AMOUNTS FOR EACH OF OUR POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS. AS I NOTED EARLIER WE NEED TO KNOW THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM AND WHAT THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IS FOR ALL OF THE STUDENTS WOULD BE RECIPIENTS. WE CAN ALSO NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION TOWARDS THIS PROGRAM. FOR WHICH WE CAN PRO RATE THE WAR- CAN. ACROSS ALL RECEIVE OF THE CURRENT STRUCK. AND WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW ALL OF THE OTHER FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID FOR WHICH THE RECEDING SO WE CAN IDENTIFY UNMET NEED GAP FOR EACH OF THE STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM. SO THAT. CERTAINLY HAS X. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WE WOULD SEE BECAUSE FROM ABOUT. FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND THIS KERR PROGRAM. THAT WOULD IN JUST THREE SIXTY THOUSAND AND THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING IN THE NEXT ACADEMIC YEAR. IT ALSO. MEANS A MORE COMPLICATED WORK INDIVIDUALIZED SET OF AWARDS FOR EACH STUDENT PARTICIPATION. SO THAT'S CHANGE THE- CONSIDERATIONS WE CAN MAKE AROUND HOW UNDER ITS CURRENT STRUCTURE WILL BE ABLE TO INFORM STUDENTS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC AWARD AMOUNT THAT THEY CAN ANTICIPATE RECEIVING. BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY MUCH MORE INDIVIDUALIZED FOR EACH STUDENT IS RECEIVING AN AWARD BASED ON THEIR COST OF ATTENDANCE AND THEIR OTHER FORMS OF AID FOR WHICH THEY RECEIVED. SO I THINK THAT COULD HAVE DIRECTOR GARCIA NOTED WE DO THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HELP US STILL MOVE FORWARD IN MPLEMENTING WHICH IN THIS CURRENT APPROPRIATION. MIGHT ALLOW US TO PROVIDE. A CLEAR PICTURE TO STUDENTS EARLIER ABOUT THE- PROTECTION YOU SEE. PREACHING FROM THE LAST ALL ARE STRUCK. YOUR FIRST DOLLARS. AND IDENTIFY FOR THE- AND- STATUSES OF STUDENTS HOW MUCH OF AN AWARD YOU WANT TO SEND TO EACH OF THOSE STUDENTS. RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS- FIGURING OUT ALL OF THEIR OTHER FORMS OF AGE FIRST. AND THEN WHAT THE YOUNG MAN NEED GAP IS AND WE THINK THAT YOU COULD STILL DO THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IN SUCH A WAY THAT STAYS WITHIN. THE APPROPRIATIONS GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AND- HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH THE LEGISLATURE. GO SO JUST WANT TO CLARIFY IN ORDER TO DO WHAT YOU JUST STATED DO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT IN STATUTE. OR DO OR DO WE OR CAN IT JUST BE ACCOMPLISHED TO THE BUDGETARY. JUST FOR THE RECORD YOU KEEP NODDING YOUR HEAD YOU SHOULD OUT LOUD SAY YES IF THAT'S WHAT. I WAS ABOUT TO COME UP WITH YOU TO ENTER AND THAT IS CORRECT. NEW JERSEY THROUGH THE BUDGET ACT PROCESS. THANKS YOU MAKE THAT DECISION TO THE- OKAY SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A STATUTORY CHANGES. YOU WERE NODDING YOUR HEAD AGAIN WAS AT IT YES YES YES. STATE BUDGET PROCESS OKAY THANK OKAY- AND THEN ONE LAST QUESTION AND THIS HAS TO DO WITH- AND I'M NOT SURE IF I JUST MISSED IT IN THE EARLY pTHAT OUR STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING YOUR LETTERS OF ACCEPTANCE. AB RIGHT THROUGH NOW FEBRUARY JERRY VERY MARCH I KNOW I KNOW THAT MUCH OF THE DETERMINING FACTOR FOR ATTENDING A CERTAIN SCHOOLS IS THE FINAL. AWARDS SO WITH THAT IN MIND HOW SOON. TAKING IN CONSIDERATION WHEN THE STUDENTS HAVE TO MAKE A FINAL- DETERMINATION OF WHAT SCHOOLS THAT THEY WILL ATTEND AND KNOWING HOW MUCH- FINANCIALLY THEY'LL BE RECEIVING. WHEN CAN THE STUDENTS- AND OF THEIR WARDS OUR HOW SOON CAN THEY LEARN OF THEIR WARDS MOVING FORWARD. YEAH AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT QUESTION SENATOR AROUND HOW THIS CAN HELP INFORM STUDENTS ABOUT. WHAT AID IS AVAILABLE TO THEM SO THAT THAT CAN SUPPORT DECISIONS THEY MAKE ABOUT ENROLLMENT AND WHICH UNIVERSITY THEY WISH TO ATTEND. AS I NOTED THERE IS ADDITIONAL DATA THAT WE NEED AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO DETERMINE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENT WHETHER OR IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE THAT'S WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CALTRANS WHAT OTHER FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID THEY MIGHT BE RECEIVING FROM THE CAMPUS. AND THEN WHAT IS THE- HOW. THIS PROGRAM- IN THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT NOW THERE IS A PROPOSED APPROPRIATION OF A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION FOR WHICH WE KNOW THERE'S- A BROAD LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT- THAT MEANS THAT IT'S NOT A FINAL APPROPRIATION AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL DATA FROM OUR CAMPUSES. AROUND WHAT THE AID PACKAGE LOOKS LIKE. SO WE COULD IDENTIFY- INITIAL PROJECTED THE WORDS BUT THOSE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. BASED ON THE FUNDING AMOUNTS RECEIVED AND CHANGES TO OUR STUDENTS FINANCES OVER THE COURSE OF AN ACADEMIC YEAR. AND TO THE CHANGES IN THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE OVER THE COURSE OF AN ACADEMIC YEAR. I'M BECAUSE OF HIS LAST DOLLAR NATURE OF THE PROGRAM AWARDS CAN CHANGE FOR STUDENTS. EVEN IN THE COURSE OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR THAT THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED. WE HAD A SIMILAR PROGRAM THOUGH IN A MUCH- MORE REDUCED CO WHEN WE WERE FIRST IMPLEMENTING THE CURRENT MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES JUST ON JEWISH. IN THOSE EARLY YEARS. YOU MAKE. DATE WITH. PLACENTA A NOTIFICATION TO STUDENTS LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THEY MAY QUALIFY FOR MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP- BECAUSE AT THAT TIME BETWEEN MARCH AFTER THEY APPLIED FOR STATE FINANCIAL AID. AND THE STATEMENT OF INTENT TO REGISTER DEADLINE AT UNIVERSITIES THAT'S TYPICALLY IN MAY- FINANCIAL AID OFFICES AND SEE SEPARATE ABLE TO HELP EACH STUDENT THE PRECISE AWARD AMOUNT THEY WOULD RECEIVE. I WANTED TO LET THEM KNOW THERE MAY BE JUST ON THE FLOOR. THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN TAKE BACK FOR CAMPUS PARTNERS AND WORK THROUGH ITS YOUTH THAT'S APPROPRIATE. IN THIS SITUATION- BUT GIVEN THE STRUCTURE OF THIS PROGRAM AND MAKES IT. DIFFICULT BETWEEN MARCH AND MAY HELP EACH STUDENT PRECISELY WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE RECEIPT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING. THESE TARGETED REFINEMENTS TO THE PROGRAM STRUCTURE THAT MIGHT HELP US BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A CLEAR PICTURE STUDENTS EARLIER IN THE PROCESS. ABOUT THE. AGE THAT THEY CAN ANTICIPATE RECEIPT. THANK YOU. DOES THAT COMPLETE YOUR WITH LET ME JUST MAKE A OF A ONE LITTLE COMMENT HERE MENTIONED HAVE YOU WERE JUST THIS AND I REALLY. THAT THAT'S GAVEL DOWN THE TENTH HEARING FOUR AND A HALF WEEKS FROM NOW YOU'RE STILL THAT EXCITE- HE THEN IS MUCH AS I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WE STILL HAVE FOUR. ITEMS ON THE AGENDA AND LET ME JUST MAKE A SUMMARY COMMENT WHICH IS THAT I THINK THE STAFF'S. ARE CHARGED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BUDGET IN THE THREE YEAR EXENDITURES MENTIONS PART OF THE CASE VERY WELL WHICH IS SAID. WE REALLY MADE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES LAST YEAR TO ADD ACCESS. IN THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING GOING SOMEWHAT MORE IT IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET IN THE NEXT YEAR. AND YET WE ALSO WANT IN MAY TO HAVE REALLY DETAILED OUR DATA. ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR SO WE CAN JUDGE IT IN OUR FINAL DECISIONS. AND I THINK SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT CENTRO CULTURAL BOGUE POINTED OUT ABOUT THE- WHO DEBT BEING LOWER IN CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO SOME OTHER STATES BUT WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. AND APPRECIATE WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ENTITLEMENTS AT THE SAME TIME. IF I HAVE A BROTHER WHO HAD THREE KIDS THAT WENT TO COLLEGE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND IT AND HE WAS JUST HANGING BY HIS FINGERNAILS FINANCIALLY ALL THE WAY THROUGH. AND I THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT ACCESS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET AS CLOSE TO A DEBT FREE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AS WE CAN. AND THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK NOT JUST AT THE IMPLEMENTATION AND VERY IMPORTANTLY LOOK AT THE SIMPLIFICATION IN A WAY THAT IT DOESN'T SCREEN PEOPLE OUT OF THE PROCESS. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO LOOK GOING FORWARD AT THE GAPS AND DO OUR BEST TO MEET THEM WHETHER IT'S THROUGH LEGISLATION. TO THAT WE THE BUDGET. AND I THINK DISC HAS BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL TO THOSE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE DATA AS IT CONTINUES TO COME IN. AND THEN I'LL WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE ASSEMBLY TO TRY TO MEET THOSE GOALS IN WATER WE CRAFTED MAY AND JUNE AND- AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS FOREVER. BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN THIS COMMITTEE IT WILL MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND THE ABILITY TO ENTER THE ECONOMY IN A GOOD WAY. AND IF WE COULD EVER GET ON WITH THE DRESSING THE HOUSING ISSUE. THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE SO INDEBTED FROM COLLEGE THAT THEY WERE EVEN FURTHER AWAY FROM GETTING INTO THE HOUSING MARKET SO ALL THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT I THINK AND CONSIDER GOING FORWARD AND- I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. ON THIS. OVER THE ISSUE TO. WHICH IS WHY CORD WERE. LOAD RESOURCE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AFTER THIS THIS IS VERY DISCREET I HOPE IT DOESN'T TAKE VERY LONG AND SO WE HAVE AGAIN GABRIELA CHAVEZ JAKE BREMNER AND LIESEGANG S. R. THREE PERCENTERS AND WE'LL START WITH GABRIELA CHAVEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE BODY CARE AND SENATORS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND ONGOING GENERAL FUND IT FIVE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE NEW PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. AND TO ADDRESS THE STAFFING NEEDS. BUDGET ALSO IN. ANY OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND THIS SUPPLEMENT EXISTING CASPER COLLEGE REGIONAL COORDINATOR FOR ORGANIZATIONS. THANK AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SURE WILL MOVE TO CHECK BERMAN- FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I DON'T START BY EXPRESSING THE COMMISSION'S GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNOR AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE PROPOSED STAFFING AUTHORITY AND ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THOSE POSITIONS AS WELL AS THE ONE TIME ALLOCATION FOR THE CASH FOR COLLEGE PROGRAM. OF THE FIVE POSITION. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET ONE WAS FUNDED IN LAST YEAR'S STATE BUDGET TO SUPPORT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION PARTICIPATION AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NEW CRADLE TO CAREER LONGITUDINAL DATA PLATFORM THAT IS IN DEVELOPMENT. OF THE OTHER FOUR POSITIONS TO WORK PROGRAM TECHNICIANS THAT WOULD HELP SUPPORT INCREASED VOLUME AT THIS TO MAKE COMMISSIONS CALL CENTER AS MORE STUDENTS ARE BEING OFFERED EIGHT AND MORE STUDENTS WILL APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID THIS FALL AS WE START TO IMPLEMENT THAT NEW REQUIREMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR. ENACTED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR THAT ALL HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS WILL APPLY FOR. AID OR SIGN OFF TO WAIT FOR. ANOTHER POSITION IS AN ATTORNEY- TO HELP WITH INCREASED WORKLOAD ACROSS THE AGENCY AROUND NEW PROGRAMS THAT WILL TALK ABOUT AT THE FEBRUARY TWENTY THIRD HEARING AS WELL AS NEW CONTRACTING ISSUES THAT ARISE WHEN OUR BUDGET GOES UP. BY ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS. AND THE FINAL POSITION IS ONE POSITION THAT COULD HELP SUPPORTERS DO NEED COMMISSION'S EFFORTS AROUND THE FINANCIAL AID COMPLETION REQUIREMENT THAT I JUST MENTIONED. SO WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT MR NEED COMMISSION DID REQUEST ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AND RESOURCES BEYOND WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. THE SECOND REQUESTED A TOTAL OF TWENTY SEVEN NEW POSITIONS INCLUDING THE FIVE LISTED HERE I'M AT A COST OF ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL ON GOING FUNDING. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO HELP US. CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR STUDENTS AND CAMPUS PARTNERS NOT ONLY IS WE GENERATE MORE STUDENT APPLICATIONS WITH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS STARTING THIS FALL. BUT AS WE START TO AWARD MORE STUDENTS. TODAY PLUS ALL SHIP PROGRAM. I KNOW COMPLETION WERE THAT THE I. T.

AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE NOTED THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS BUT THIS AID COMMISSION IS MANAGING RELATIVE TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. BUDGET ACT- BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING THE NEW PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE ALREADY SAW AN INCREASE OF OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STUDENT COMMISSION. THAT DID NOT COME WITH ANY ADDITIONAL STAFF OR STATE ADMINISTRATIVE- FUNDING SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT ONGOING STAFFING NEEDS AS A RESULT OF THAT. SO AND IN THE FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY ALL POTS MY COMMENTS HERE BUT I'M CERTAINLY ALSO HAPPY TO SPEECH AT A ONE TIME PROPOSED INVESTMENT AROUND THE CASH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT I HAVE TO SAY MISS COMMITTEE WE CON. REDUCE THE DEFINITION OF GRAVITY SO I WILL MOVE ON TO LIESEGANG FROM THE ALEJO'S OFFICE. THANK YOU.

HI MY COLLEAGUES AT THE COMMISSION HAVE NOTED THEY DID REQUEST SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POSITIONS AND IN THE COURSE THIS SPRING THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO WORK WITH THEM AS ELL AS A THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ARE WARRANTED IN ORDER TO. ENSURE THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE. PROGRAMS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AFTER THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE FOR COLOR UP AND HE THIS IS. TO THE REQUIRE. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONFIRM HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS ARE COMPLETING FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS. WE NEED THIS NEW REQUIREMENT LATEX ATTRACTED TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IS LIKELY TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR CASH FOR COLLEGE WORKSHOP. WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ONE TIME BOND.

IN TONIGHT AND LEAVE RECOMMENDED IN YOUR CHEN DONG TOP OF PAGE TWENTY ONE SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY WISH TO ADD.

STATEMENT ABOUT THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION GOING FORWARD. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL HAVE MORE DATA. ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ACCESSING THE CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM AND MAY. AND I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY WILL WORK TOGETHER TO DECIDE IF THIS IS AN ADEQUATE STAFFING LEVEL BASED UPON THE DATA WHEN IT COMES IN. AND THAT THERE'S THE POTENTIAL GIVEN SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE EVEN WISE AND- THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME ADDITIONS NEXT YEAR. AND IF THERE ARE. DEAR OUR- HOPE THIS WOULD FACTOR IN DISK. THAT WOULD BEFORE THE MAYOR MAY REVISE ON THE STAFFING LEVELS SO I JUST THINK. WE WOULD LIKE TO REVISIT THE STAFFING ISSUE AT THE TIME THAT. THAT MORE DATA IS IN AND WE HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT BE DOING NEXT YEAR SO. I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS HERE.

ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE AFFECTED SO MANY THANK EVERYBODY THAT. PARTICIPATED IN THE DISCUSSIONS. FOR THE STUDENT AID. THE FIRST TWO ITEMS WERE GONNA TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THE- NEXT THREE ITEMS RELATED TO CSU TO THE COMMENTS TOGETHER. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO- THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM CSU THE FIRST ISSUE IS BASED BUDGET INCREASE RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND GENERAL UPDATES WE HAVE FOUR PANELISTS. BRIAN STORM FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY DR NATHAN EVANS FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY JENNIFER LOUIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LEASE IT CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE OPENING COMMENTS IN THAT ORDER. AND WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH RAIMES STORM OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY- WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CHAIR. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A FEW WORDS ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY BEFORE DELVING INTO EACH OF THE ISSUES ON THE REST OF YOUR AGENDA TODAY. MY NAME IS RYAN STORM I AM THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR.-WITH ME TODAY ARE NATION EVANS HE IS THE ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR AND CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE ACT AGAINST INVADERS.

SO THREE OF US WILL PROVIDE YOU THAT DETAIL FOR A TO SEE ISSUES PERSPECTIVE. AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY. SERVER MIGHT BE TO CALL. I WOULD LIKE TO THREE. YOU'RE FOR. SOME HIGH LEVEL FAX POLICY ISSUE. SECOND THE MULTI YEAR CONTACT THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR- BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND CSU YES THIRD COMMENTS ON THIS BUDGET CYCLE IN PARTICULAR. SO MY FIRST TOPIC AS A QUICK REFRESHER LIKE TO SHARE SOME HIGH LEVEL FACTS AND FIGURES ABOUT THE C. ISSUE. AS THE NATION'S LARGEST FOUR YEAR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY DECISION PROVIDES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS ON TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. AND THOSE CAMPUSES STRETCH FROM CAL POLY HUMBLE MINORIS TO SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE SOUTH. THIS ISSUE ANNUAL CONFERS ALMOST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DEGREES THAT'S UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE PROGRAMS DEGREES AND POST NEARLY FOUR MILLION LIVING ALUMNI. ALSO NEARLY HALF OF ALL THE BACHELOR'S DEGREES AWARDED IN CALIFORNIA R. C. ISSUE DEGREES AND ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIA WORKERS IS A CSU GRADUATE. NOW MY SECOND TOPIC WHICH ARE CUT WHICH OUR COMMENTS ON THE MOST OF YOUR CONTACT. THE CONTACT IS AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE FOR CALIFORNIA. IN THE C. ISSUE ESPECIALLY FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY. YOU WILL NOT FIND ALL THE UNIVERSITIES NEEDS AND REVIEW THIS BUDGET CONTACT AS A CRITICAL SAFETY NET TO PROTECT THE UNIVERSITY FROM ECONOMICS FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. YOU KNOW THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LAWS ARE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE ANY BUDGETARY ASSURANCES ARE PREDICTABILITY FROM YEAR TO YEAR FOR TO SEE ISSUE. SO WE THEREFORE ARE GRATEFUL VERY GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR. IN HIS ADMINISTRATION FOR THE SMALL FOR YOUR COMMITMENT. IT'S MY THIRD TOPIC. WHICH IS COMMENTS ABOUT THAT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET. SO JUST MASON AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SEVERAL BUDGETARY NEEDS AND THEY ARE ARTICULATED IN THE TRUSTEES OPERATE BUDGET REQUESTS- THIS ISSUES PLAN WILL HELP US ENSURE THAT FAIR AND EQUITABLE COMPENSATION OF OUR WORLD CLASS A STUDENT CENTER FACULTY AND STAFF- THAT BUDGET PLAN BY THE TRUSTEES WILL ELEVATE STUDENT SUCCESS FOR ALL WITH A FOCUS ON COMPLETING AND ELIMINATING- EQUITY GAPS THAT EXIST BETWEEN STUDENTS OF COLOR. FIRST GENERATIONAL- STUDENTS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND THEIR PEERS B. R. GRADUATION ISSUE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND THAT PLAN WILL ALSO REPAIR AND MODERNIZE OUR AGING FACILITIES MANAGER STRUCTURE. PROMOTE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT WHAT PROVIDE THE SAFEST POSSIBLE VARMINT FOR STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF. AND THEN THE PLAN WILL ALSO PROMOTES TO BASIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL NEEDS ONLY GROWS AND COVER MANDATORY COST INCREASES. NOW GOVERNOR NUISANCE FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR THE SUSHI RECOGNIZES THE POWERFUL ROLE OUR CAMPUS IS PLAYING THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AND HIS PROPOSAL ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TRUSTEES BUDGET REQUESTED THAT PLAN THAT SOME OF THOSE PIECES I JUST MENTION. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE BE TWO HUNDRED NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF ON GOING FUNDING. AND THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION OF ONE TIME FUNDING HE PUT TOWARD THE ITEMS I JUST DESCRIBED. BUT THERE DOES REMAIN A GAP BETWEEN THE TRUSTEES BUDGET PLAN THE GOVERNOR'S FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. CAN WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL TAKE BOTH AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE STATE REVENUE PICTURE AND PUBLIC POLICY CHOICES FIND YOU THE SENATE AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNOR IN MAY AND IN JUNE. FOR THIS TO OCCUR. WE'LL BE READY TO DO MORE AT THE TOP I SEE SHE'S TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE CARE- AND COMPETITIVE SOUTH FOR FACULTY AND STAFF. TO REDUCE EQUITY GAPS AND MEET THE GROWING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF OUR CAMPUSES AMONG OTHER ITEMS MENTIONED. SO IN CONCLUSION I HAVE TWO NUMBERS. YOUR NUMBER. FIRST THIS ISSUE BUDGET BE INCREASED BY AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION IN ONGOING FUNDING TO. THE TRUSTEES BALANCE OF THE TRUSTEES PROPERTY BUDGET PARTIES. IN SECOND THAT AN ADDITIONAL NINE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME DOLLARS BE ADDED TO FIND. ECONOMIC FACILITIES AND WORLD RENEWAL DATES- OF MY FUTURE COLLEAGUE DR NATHAN EVANS WILL SHARE VIEWS ON GRADUATION SHOULD. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ENROLLMENT MATTERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WELCOME DOCTOR OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS NATHAN EVANS AND I SERVICE ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR AND CHIEF OF STAFF FOR ACADEMIC INSTEAD IS THAT THE CSU AND I WANT TO SAY THAT AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER STORM THANK YOU CHAIR LAYERED SENATORS MAN IN A TROUBLE FOR TODAY'S TOPICS. AS MR STORE MENTION WE ARE DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S AND THE LEGISLATURE'S CONTINUED SUPPORT OF STUDENT SUCCESS ADDRESSING INEQUITIES IN STUDENT OUTCOMES AND INCREASING ACCESS TO THE CSU THESE ACTIONS RECOGNIZE THE ROLE HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE CSU SPECIFICALLY PLAYS IN THE STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND THE LONG TERM SOCIAL MOBILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC CHANCER CASTRO AND R. TWENTY THREE CAMPUS PRESIDENTS HAVE GUIDED THE UNIVERSITY FOLLOWING TO KEEP PRINCIPLES. FIRST SAFEGUARDING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR ENTIRE C. ISSUE COMMUNITY. AND SECOND ENSURING THAT AS MANY STUDENTS AS POSSIBLE HAVE ACCESS TO AND STAY ON TRACK TO EARNING THE LIFELONG BENEFITS OF THE CSU DEGREE. OUR COMMITMENT TO SEE A SPOT TO STUDENT SUCCESS IN EQUITY THEIR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE REMAINS CONSTANT. AND THE C. ISSUES ABILITY TO MEET THE STATE'S FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS THROUGH THE INITIATIVE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PREDICATED BOTH ON IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET RECOGNIZES BOTH OF THESE ELEMENTS. I'M PLEASED TO SHARE THAT IN SPITE OF THE PANDEMIC DURING THE LAST COLLEGE YEAR NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS EARNED A CSU BACHELOR'S DEGREE. MARKING AN ALL TIME RECORD FOR UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES AWARDED BY THE CSU. THESE ACHIEVEMENTS REPRESENT NEARLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MORE DEGREES EARNED IN A SINGLE YEAR COMPARED TO TWENTY FOUR BY TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE YEAR BEFORE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BEGAN. AND THESE GRADUATES HELP THE CSU ACHIEVED THE MILESTONE OF FOUR MILLION LIVING CSU ALUMNI. IT'S ALSO EXCITING TO SHARE THE GRADUATION RATES FOR BOTH THOSE THAT INTEREST FIRST TIME STUDENTS FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND THOSE THE TRANSFER FROM CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE AT ALL TIME HIGHS IN THE C. ISSUE FOR ALL STUDENT GROUPS. BUT OUR WORK ISN'T FINISHED. AS GRADUATION OUTCOMES HAVE IMPROVED FOR ALL STUDENTS GAPS OF MOVED IN STEP WITH THOSE IMPROVEMENTS. AND TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS AS ONE OF HIS FIRST ACTS CHANCER CASTRO AND LISTED A GROUP OF EXPERTS STAKEHOLDERS. TO FORM GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THEIR CHARGE WAS TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STRATEGIC SOLUTIONS. CLEARLY AND WILL ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS EMPOWER RECIPIENTS ACROSS OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. FROM THIS WORK IN NOVEMBER THE CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCED FIVE EQUITY PRIORITIES INTENDED TO AFFECT CHANGE OUT SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM CHANGE. AMONG THESE PRIORITIES WERE FIRST AND IMMEDIATE RE ENROLLMENT AND RE ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGNS UNDERSERVED STUDENTS WHO LEFT THE UNIVERSITY DURING THE PANDEMIC. SECOND THE STRATEGIC USE OF SUMMER AND INTERCESSIONS TO GET STUDENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES BACK ON TRACK TO TIMELY GRADUATION. AND THREE THE CRITICAL EVALUATION OF UNIVERSITY PROCESS SEES WITH WITH AN EYE TOWARD ELIMINATING AS MANY INSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS TO STUDENT SUCCESS IS POSSIBLE. I'M TURNING FINALLY TO ENROLLMENT THE CSU SYSTEM IS POISED TO OFFER NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND YEARS TO COME. AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY DURING THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC THE C. ISSUE RECORDED A RECORD STUDENT POPULATION WHICH BUCKED NATIONAL TRENDS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION ROLE AT. FIVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS PAST FALL THE IMPACT OF THE ONGOING ONGOING PANDEMIC WAS EVIDENT IN MODEST DECLINES IN BOTH NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND INCREASED RETENTION OF CONTINUING STUDENTS. BRING OUR SYSTEMWIDE ENROLLMENT BACK DOWN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN LEVELS. AND WHILE WE DO EXPECT TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF LOWER COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT OR TRANSFER STUDENT POPULATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO COME. I'M EXCITED TO SHARE THAT APPLICATIONS FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO ADMISSION FROM HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS HAVE ALREADY REBOUNDED BY NEARLY 15% ABOVE LAST YEAR. AND LASTLY AS I MENTIONED THE RE ENGAGEMENT OF STUDENTS OF COLOR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND THOSE WITH SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL NEED. TO HAD TO SUSPEND THEIR EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY DURING THE PANDEMIC IS AMONG OUR HIGHEST EQUITY PRIORITIES. STE WITH EARLY SIGNALS FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THE BUDGET OUR CSU CAMPUSES WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE GREATER NUMBERS OF ADMISSIONS OFFICER OFFERS. AND FOCUS MORE TIME ATTENTION TO SUPPORT FOR YIELDING THESE NEW STUDENTS. AND THE MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH WILL ALLOW MORE SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING AND ALLOCATION OF NEW ENROLLMENT TO THE MOST IN DEMAND CAMPUSES IN REGIONS. TO ACHIEVE BOTH OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS AND EQUITY GOALS AND MEET CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS BILL TAKEN CONTINUED INVESTMENT COLLECTED FOCUSED AND INTENTIONAL ACTION. ACROSS THE C. ISSUE IN SACRAMENTO AND AMONG OUR VALUED PARTNERS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND THESE TOPICS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND NOW WILL MOVE TO JENNIFER LOUIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING MR CARE AND MEMBERS JENNIFER LOUIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS A SKIN IS FOCUSED- BUDGET WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ACCESS EQUITY AND INNOVATION. THIS INCLUDES AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED FOUR POINT ONE MILLION WHICH CONSIST OF TWELVE MILLION FOUR FOSTER YOU SERVICES EIGHTY ONE MILLION AND ONGOING RESOURCES. FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS UNDER ROMAN GROWTH OF 940-009-9000 FOUR NINE THREE FOUR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR AS WELL AS A ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CSU BAKERSFIELD ENERGY INNOVATION CENTER AND SUPPORTING UNIVERSITY FARMS. THE 5% INCREASE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE REPRESENTS THE FIRST YEAR OF A PLANT BASED GROWTH OF 5% ANNUALLY THREE TWENTY TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN. IN RECOGNITION OF CSU'S COMMITMENT TOWARD ACHIEVING MULTIPLE GOALS THROUGH A MULTI MULTI YOUR CONTACT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AIMED AT THE FOLLOWING INCREASING ACCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IMPROVING STUDENT SUCCESS AND ADVANCING EQUITY. INCREASING THE AFFORDABILITY OF A CSU EDUCATION INCREASING INTER SEGMENTAL COLLABORATION TO BENEFIT STUDENTS SUPPORTING WORKFORCE PREPAREDNESS AND HIGH DEMAND CAREER PIPELINES AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO ONLINE COURSE OFFERINGS. THIS CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE OR ANY FURTHER DETAIL AS REQUESTED THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE POLICE CAME LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU. IN THIS ISSUE OF HEARING AGAIN DESK ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWENTY. VERY ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED MEETING CLIFFORD TO TWENTY THREE AND THEN TRYING TO IMPLEMENT FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. PAST WEEK THINK THAT THE APPROACH OF PROVIDING AN UNRESTRICTED BASED ON PEACE HAS TO DISADVANTAGES. ONE OF WHICH IS BAD BECAUSE NONE OF THESE CASES NOT DIRECTLY TIED TO DOCUMENT THE COST INCREASES THAT THE FACULTY FACING. CONCEAL THE STARTING THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWENTY YOUR TIME THAT ONLY FILL IT OUT MEANT TO KEEP COSTING. THIS YEAR HE WAS IDENTIFIED. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THIS INCLUDES COSTA. RATE INCREASED EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS. SALARY INCREASES FACULTY WITH HIM YES HE WAS RECENTLY NEGOTIATED A TENTATIVE AGREEMENT. PUTTING THE SALARY POOL FOR NON FACULTY EMPLOYEES MANY OF WHOM CURRENTLY HAVE CONTRACTS. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. INCREASES IN CERTAIN NON PERSONNEL COSTS FOR EXAMPLE BACK INCLUDE GRATION ON OPERATING EXPENSES. WE RECOMMEND OF THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WHICH OF THESE COST INCREASES IT WISHES TO SUPPORT FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND USE THAT TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE BASE INCREASED BY. BERMAN HE RECALL THE LAST YEAR'S AGREEMENT INCLUDING INTENT TO FUND ECONOMIC GROWTH OF NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOR RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. SENDING THIS THE MOMENT TARGET YES YOU HAVE SEEN DECLINES IN ENROLLMENT. AS MY COLLEAGUES AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF NOTED FUNDING FROM THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. BASED ON ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE MOMENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. ARE PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS LOWER THAN THEY WERE. PREVIOUSLY. WHAT HE STANDS FOR THE LEGISLATORS AMONG THE GROWTH TARGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE. BECAUSE IT CSU ACTORS NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR STUDENTS ON TO THIS LOWER BASELINE LEVEL THE CURRENT ACT. IT STILL WOULD BE PROJECTED TO SERVE FEWER STUDENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OF THAT ACT AT TWO YEARS EARLIER TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SO WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE. WE WISH TO CONSIDER HOW THIS IMPACTS THE MOMENT TARGETS AND PROPOSED FUNDING LEVEL FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. LEGISLATURE HAS EXPRESSED QUITE A LOT OF INTEREST IN GROWING REAL INTEREST YES YOU AND RIGHT NOW SINCE CAMPUS ADMISSIONS DECISIONS FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY WE THINK ACTUALLY THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT GROWTH. EVEN BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. ILLEGAL COULD NOT ATTEND AT SOME CONSIDERATIONS THAT YOU MAY WISH TO THINK THROUGH AS YOU DECIDE ON A NORMAL LEVEL FOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THIS INCLUDES CHANGES IN A NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ABOUT A FAX FRESHMAN DEMANDED CSU. CHANGES INCLUDING COLLAGEN WOMAN SAYS THAT OF COURSE THE TAX TRANSFER DEMAND. FROM THE MOMENT MODEL OF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES FOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IF IT IS HIGHER THAN PREVIOUS EMPLOYMENT IT'S YES YOU LIVE RECOMMENDED PROVIDING A MOMENT GROWTH AUGMENTATION. THIS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE APPROACH PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND HIS MULTI YEAR CONTRACT. WHICH WOULD EXPECTS YES YOUR ACCOMMODATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH INCREASES FROM WITHIN ITS STARTING OUT HERE'S- THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TAKING QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M TOM THAT COMPLETES THE PANELISTS AND I'M TO BEGIN WITH A FEW QUESTIONS. AND AND THEN GO TO MY COLLEAGUES AND FIRST. OF FOR MR STORM I'M JUST TRYING TO DO AN APPLES TO APPLES BECAUSE OF. THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDED SAID THAT. YOU WOULD LIKE AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING MILLION DO YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENT THAT IS OF THAT I KNOW 5% PLUS WHAT PERCENT. I WOULD SAY A THE WAY TO LOOK AT IT- FROM DESI ISSUES PERSPECTIVE PRIMARY FUND SOURCES THAT SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY- FIRST STATE GENERAL FUND. AND SECONDLY WE HAVE THE TUITION AND FEES THAT STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY. SO ONE THING THAT TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT WHEN WE DO TALK ABOUT A 5% INCREASE TO THE GENERAL FUND PORTION OF OUR BUDGET THAT IS ABOUT A TWO POINT 85% OPERATING BUDGET INCREASE. TO UNIVERSITY- IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF THE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THAT I MENTIONED I'D HAVE TO DO SOME WORK ON A CALCULATOR AND REAL QUICK I TRY TO BUY ENOUGH TIME TO DO THAT BUT I DON'T LISTEN WERE YOU CAN LET YOU KNOW LET US NOW BUT I WILL JUST. BE HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE UC'S ABOUT THE PERCENT INCREASE COMPARED TO THEIRS AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS BEFORE I GET THE INCOMING FROM THE OTHER BRANCHES ABOUT EQUITY YEAH SO JUST LET ME KNOW WHAT THAT PERCENT IS THEN LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION- ONE OF THE- OF AUDIO TALKED ABOUT YOUR TENTATIVE AGREEMENT BOB WITH THE FACULTY AND IT IS ON PAGE SEVENTEEN OF OUR STAFF REPORT AND FIRST IT ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF TENTATIVE THE SAID IN FRONT OF BOTH THE BOARD AND THE UNION TO RATIFY NOW WHAT'S THE STATUS OF FACTOR THAT THAT'S CORRECT SEWER BOARD OF TRUSTEES MET LAST WEEK AND APPROVED. ITS PORTION OF THAT AGREEMENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE ARE TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION WILL BE OUR- VOTING ON ON THEIR PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT- SOMETIME THIS MONTH I BELIEVE IT'S THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS OF THIS MONTH IT. IS THE SCHEDULE. WE'LL SEE IF WE HAVE A FINAL AGREEMENT OKAY AND THEN THE WITH REGARD. THIS GIVES ME THE DETAILS ARE GENERALLY SPELLED OUT IN OUR STAFF REPORT AND IT TALKS ABOUT. PAYMENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY RELATED- TO WATCH YOURS YOUR GENERAL FUND- ALLOCATIONS MIGHT BE FROM THE STATE D. A. IF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS APPROVED AT THAT PERCENTAGE LEVEL. YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO IMPLEMENT DISAGREEMENT. WE DO YES THE- YOUR YOUR AGENDA ITEM I THINK THAT- PROPERLY- REFLECTS THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST THAT WE HAVE WITH THE TEN AGAINST CALIFORNIA BAPTIST ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT. SAYS EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS- THAT WILL COVER THE GENERAL SALARY INCREASE BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER ELEMENT CONSTRUCTION INCREASE SO EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THEIR- WE ALSO HAVE- I NUMBER MANDATORY ITEMS THAT- THIS KING POINTED OUT. IN HER ANALYSIS AND THAT IS REFLECTED JAMES WELL THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE VERY BASIC THAT WE MUST COVER SO FOR EXAMPLE. CALPERS SHEETS ANYMORE HEALTH CARE- PROGRAM COSTS THOSE COSTS HAVE GONE UP BY ABOUT FORTY NINE DOGS YOURSELF THOSE ARE FIRM COSTS THAT WE WILL HAVE IT THE UNIVERSE REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH FUNDS PROVIDED. IN THE BEYOND THAT IT JUST BECOMES A DECISION MAKING TREE ULTIMATELY WHEN YOU THE GOVERNOR IN THE ASSEMBLY COME TO A CONCLUSION ON WHAT WILL BE IN THE BUDGET NOPE IT'S TOUCH UP MORE BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER PARTIES LIKE TO ADDRESS FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO FOR EXAMPLE. REALLY BEST A LOT OF PAIN CITING TO STILL. WILL TO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE LITTLE BIT WEST ADVICE JUAN AND OTHERS. BUT IT JUST MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE OTHER PRIORITIES. THAT ARE NOT. FREEING CLEAR RIGHT IN OUR FACE SO TO SPEAK BUT ARE THINGS THAT ARE ASPIRATIONAL. LIKE TO INVESTORS. LIKE TO GRADUATION AND SHIP REPLY CAN FACILITY ITSELF WILL BE MORE CHALLENGING OBVIOUSLY NOTICING THAT STILL HAS THAT STILL OPEN A SENATOR. RELATED YOUR QUESTION. IS THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER. REPRESENTED AND NOT REPRESENTED GROUPS THAT HAVE HAVE NOT HAD ANY SORT OF A RESOLUTION TO THEIR- SALARY NEEDS FOR. FOR THE FUTURE SO THOSE ARE THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE NO THEIR TRUNCHEONS. OF COSTS THAT WE WILL BE- I NEED TO ADDRESS WITH THIS TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS SO. I DON'T WANT TO DO NOT SOMETHING PRICE I DON'T WANT TO INFLUENCE. YOUR YOUR- NEGOTIN WOULD YOU EXPECT THAT HOWEVER YOU CONCLUDE THOSE AGREEMENTS YOU HAVE ENOUGH FROM THE GOVERNOR'S 5% TO PAY FOR THEM. I WILL CERTAINLY SIR DUCK THAT QUESTION FOR NOW WE'RE GOING TO LET THAT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE UNIONS AND- MANAGEMENT WORK THEMSELVES THROUGH AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE WHERE THOSE AGREEMENTS PLAN BUT OBVIOUSLY IT. THIS WILL BE ONE OF ONE THIS WILL BE THE ONLY TIME IN A HEARING THAT I WILL LET YOU DUCKED QUESTIONS. YOU VIEW STUFF YOUR ONE SO I SHOULD PROBABLY START TO MAKE A LIST OF OTHER QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUNOW SINCE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DOCK. UP- LET ME MOVE TO A QUESTION FOR DOC EVANS. IN AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. EQUITY GAPS IN YOUR COMMENTS AND ON PAGE NINETEEN. OF OUR- AGENDA IT SHOWS THAT THE CSU GRADUATION EQUITY GAP FOR BLACK NATIVE AMERICAN AND LATINO STUDENTS GREW TO TWELVE POINT 4% IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE UP FROM TEN POINT 5% AND TWENTY TWENTY I WOULD ASK HOW YOU IN THE CAMPUSES ARE FOCUSING ON CLOSING THESE EQUITY GAPS IN WHAT ENHANCEMENTS OR RESOURCES ARE COULD BE PROVIDED TO YOU OR WOULD YOU NEED TO HELP THE CSU MEET THAT GOAL. I THANK YOU TRAILER- AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND ONE THAT REALLY IS DRIVING OUR WORK EVERY DAY- AS I AS I REFERENCED IN MY COMMENTS- THE CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCED A THREE TO FIVE POINT EQUITY PRIORITY- PLAY. LAST FALL THAT REALLY IS FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS- NOT ONLY IN THE SHORT TERM BUT WITH THE GOAL OF ELIMINATING THEM PERMANENTLY- THAT INCLUDES. SOME OF THAT GAP HAS IS CAUSED BY STUDENTS SIMPLY LEAVING THE UNIVERSITY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND SO THAT FIRST PRIORITY THAT I MENTION IN TERMS OF. A FOCUS RE ENGAGEMENT AND RE ENROLLMENT CAMPAIGN WHICH IS VERY FOCUSED ON AFRICAN AMERICAN LATIN ACTS AND NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS AMONG OTHERS THAT MAY HAVE LEFT THE UNIVERSITY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND- FINDING OUT IN ADDRESSING EVERY VERY INDIVIDUAL LEVEL- THE REASONSWHY THEY LEFT THE CSU WHAT STEPS CAN BE TAKEN TO GET THEM BACK INTO THE C. S. U. B. N. ARTS. SUPPORT ARENA. AB AND ACADEMIC PREPARATION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND AS A REFERENCE THAT REALLY IS AT AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND I'LL I'LL HIGHLIGHT ONE OF OUR CAMPUSES SAN FRANCISCO STATE THAT BEGAN THIS WORK VERY EARLY- FOCUSING ALL STUDENTS FROM THE ENTERING CLASS OF TWENTY NINETEEN OR FALL TWENTY TWENTY. THAT WERE NO LONGER STILL ENROLLED AND AGAIN SORT OF CREATING A TRIAGE TEAM TO MAKE OUT REACHED STUDENTS TO WORK THROUGH INDIVIDUAL. C. ISSUE COMMUNITY IN THIS ASE SAN FRANCISCO STATE AND IN THEIR CASE WHILE THEY MAY HAVE ONLY INITIALLY. HAD A GOAL OF RECOUPING 10% OF THEIR STUDENT OF THOSE STUDENTS AN ACT FIRST PASSED ACTUALLY DOUBLE THAT IN AND RECOUP TO- 20% OF THOSE STUDENTS SO IT'S THAT VERY INDIVIDUALIZED STRATEGY THAT IS IN THE SHORT TERM. AS WELL AS SOME THAT ARE LONGER TERM- WE AT ONE OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS IS FOCUSED ON HIGH ENROLLMENT. COURSES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF- EARNING A NON PASSING GRADE PREDOMINATELY FOR. STUDENTS OF COLOR LOW INCOME FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND THEN WORKING WITH WITH FACULTY WITH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS TO LOOK AT THE- G. THE STRUCTURE. I THOUGHT OLOGY THE- THE MODE OF INSTRUCTION TO REALLY LOOK AND SEE IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO RETHINK AND REWORK THAT TEACHING APPROACH SO THAT WE HAVE STRONGER OUTCOMES AGAIN USING THE SAME CURRICULUM AND EMPOWERING FACULTY TO HELP MAKE THOSE CHANGES SO. SUMMER VERY STRATEGIC SHORT TERM EFFORTS LIKE THAT RIAN GO GAUGE MEN RE ENROLLMENT OTHERS ARE INTENDED TO BE MORE SYSTEMIC CHANGES. FOCUSED ON- AS I SAID SORT OF COURSE REDESIGN AT FOR THE BETTERMENT. OF STUDENTS I'M GOING FORWARD. ARMAR I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD KEEP US INFORMED ABOUT. WHAT IT MIGHT TAKE TO. pGOALS AND IF THERE'S ANY ASSISTANCE FOR- WERE RE DIRECTION OR ANYTHING THAT GETS US THERE AND LET ME ASK THE OTHER HALF OF THAT QUESTIONING YOU SORT OF GOT UP TO IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT- HOW CAMPUSES ARE USING. OUR STATE BUDGET FUNDS TOWARD EXISTING OF PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES AND REDUCE EQUITY GAPS. THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED AND MAYBE TO- CONNECT THE DOTS I WILL- CITY TO THIS SORT OF- END OF YOUR LIFE COMMENTS REGARDING MY PRIOR RESPONSE. AS MR STORM ALLUDED TO THERE STILL REMAINS A GAP BETWEEN THE BUDGET THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL- AMONG THOSE ELEMENTS IS CONTINUED INVESTMENT INTO GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND SO. THAT IS AN EXPLICIT WAY- THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS WORK- TO SEE THAT AND AUGMENTATION COVERING. THEIR WORK TO MISTER STORMS POINT THAT DELTA OUT BETWEEN. EIGHT OUR TRUSTEES BUDGET AND THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET IN TERMS OF ALLOCATION OF. OUR PRIOR RESOURCES THE ACT IF AS YOU ALLUDED TO THEY HAVE GONE TO BOTH THE INFUSION OF EXISTING PROGRAMS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE A SUCCESSFUL WAY TO SORT OF GET STUDENTS INTO A CONTACT WITH THE WITH THE UNIVERSITY THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF SETTING. OBJECTIVES AND GOALS IN TERMS OF MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS AND- METRICS FOR THEIR OWN STUDENT SUCCESS. WELL I- THING AND THIS IS I WAS- WHOLE CHANCE CASTRO OUT IN SHINING LIGHT ON POINTS OF SUCCESS DO HAVE CAMPUS IS ALREADY. OUT OF LOCALLY ELIMINATED EQUITY GAPS- AT THE MACRO WHAT YOU IS WHAT YOU SEE IN THE END TODAY'S HEARING REPORT BUT WE HAVE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. AND TAKING THAT LEARNING AND APPLYING IT TO OTHER CAMPUSES FOR EXAMPLE A CHANCER CASTRO HAS ILLUSTRATED THAT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- BUT FRESNO STATE WHERE HE WAS FORMALLY PRESIDENT AND STANISLAUS. SHARED MANY OF THE SAME STUDENT COMMUNITIES AND STANISLAUS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN NEARLY ZERO WING OUT OUT THE GAP- FOR PELL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND SO AS A FORMER. AS SENIOR LEADER AT FRESNO TO LEARN FROM HIS COLLEAGUES JUST UP- JUST UP THE VALLEY WAS INVALUABLE AND RELEASING OTHER STRATEGIES TO- TO HELP STUDENTS FROM SIMILAR COMMUNITIES SUCCEED. THANK YOU M. OBVIOUSLY FROM THESE TWO QUESTIONS WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN THIS AND WE WANT TO KNOW. IT AND- WE WANT YOU TO TELL US WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT AND WHAT YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR US SO JUST NOTED AND I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSES. ARE I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION BEFORE GOING TO MY COLLEAGUES AND IT'S PROBABLY. A RAIMES STORM QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR- BARB A REPORT OF SPEAKS TO THE SWANTON PACIFIC RANCH REBUILD CAL POLY. AND IT'S A THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED ACRE WORKING RANCH THAT JOB THAT SERVES AS AN EDUCATIONAL FACILITY WITH AMAZING LEARNING AND FOR ST AGRICULTURE. AND CZ YOU FIRE IN TWENTY TWENTY DESTROYED MOST EVERYTHING IT'S I'VE BEEN THROUGH THERE. AND THE- THERE'S ONE BUILDING THAT WAS AT THE EDGE OF A FIELD THAT SURVIVED EVERYTHING ELSE SEEM TO GO OUT OF FORCED WILLIAMS- ALL THE OTHER BUILDINGS EVEN A NARROW GAUGE RAILWAY. AND I HAVE IT'S IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN THE STAFF REPORT BUT I HAVE. HE SENT TO ME. SORT OF WHAT A REQUEST IS FOR THE REBUILD AND I THINK IT FALLS INTO CATEGORIES SO I THINK THE PRIORITY IS. SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION JUST FOR THE FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE THEY COME BACK. AND THEN THIRTY MILLION FOR AN ADDITIONAL- ACADEMIC CENTER THAT MIGHT FOCUS. ON THE REBUILD AND VISITORS AND OTHER THINGS AND MY QUESTION IS. COULD YOU SPEAK TO THE REBUILT I MEAN AS THEIR DISASTER RELIEF MONEY IT IS THEIR OTHER STUFF THAT THAT IS COMING IN THIS IS JUST THE UNFUNDED GAP AT THE END TO DO THE REBUILD BAND- JUST SPEAK TO SORT OF WHAT MIGHT BE A REQUEST RELATED. TO THAT. SENATOR SO IN IN KIND OF A ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. SO THERE'S A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF BETWEEN FORTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION AND FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO RE TURN THE RANCH TO ITS PRIOR STATE SO THIS IS JUST KIND OF THESE TWO PIECES OF THIS OF THIS RANCHES SITUATION FIRST AS- CAN WE GET IT BACK TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE AND THEN THERE'S AN ASPIRATIONAL ASPECT OF IT. THAT'S BEYOND THAT FOR- EXPANDING AND MAKING A LARGER EDUCATIONAL CENTER SO JUST ON THE PART OF GETTING THE RANCH BACK TO WHERE WAS BEFORE OBVIOUSLY WITH NEW BUILDINGS IN THE RENT FOR STRUCTURE. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT THREE PIECES OF THIS RESTORATION FIRST IS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ESTIMATED- THAT WILL BE COMING IN FROM INSURANCE THAT COVERS YOU KNOW BUILDINGS THINGS THAT WERE COVERED IN THAT WAY- THEN ALSO THE CAMPUS SAN LUIS OBISPO HAS SUBMITTED EAST. BASED ON THEIR TO. REIMBURSED FOR YOU'RE LOOKING T ABOUT ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REIMBURSEMENT SOME MANY MONTHS IF NOT YEARS DOWN THE ROAD- THAT'S USUALLY AT. THAT DURATION OF TIME IT TAKES PAYMENT ACTUALLY. FOLLOW THROUGH AND FINISH OFF CLAIMS. THAT LEAVES THE CAMPUS WITH THAT AMOUNT THAT YOU MENTION EIGHT POINT SEVEN EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. OF KIND OF A GAP BECAUSE ON A FEMA CLAIM THEY COVER TYPICALLY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE COST OF A CLAIM AND THEN THERE'S THIS KIND OF THIS GAP AND WHAT'S ALSO PART OF THIS EQUATION ON THE EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION THAT YOU REFERENCE SENATOR. IS THIS NOTION THAT- THERE'S AN ADJUSTMENT OVER THE WHOLE. TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT BECAUSE AS TIME MARCHES ON AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS INCREASING PERMITTING- REMAINING COST INCREASES WELL. WE'RE WE'RE JUST BUILDING IN AN ADDITIONAL THE CAMPUS IS BUILT AN ADDITIONAL AND I'M NOT JUST GETTING THE MONEY BACK- TO COVER CURRENT COST BUT YOU DO NEED TO BUILD IN SOME SORT OF FUNCTION OF INSULATION SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT EIGHT POINT SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. F FUNDING GAP- BUT I DIED ALSO DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE COMMITTEE WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS IS ALL GONNA COME TOGETHER SUPER QUICKLY AT THE MOMENT YOU KNOW THE CAMPUS HAS A MULTI YEAR- PLAN IN TERMS OF GETTING GETTING A SWANTON PACIFIC RANCH BACK UP AND RUNNING. SEPARATELY APART FROM THAT THERE'S THIS DESIRED JUST HAPPENED EVEN BEFORE THE FIRE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WAS A DESIRE TO AND ACTUALLY- A PERMIT TO ACTUALLY EXPAND ALL OF THE EDUCATIONAL CENTER FACILITIES PRETTY EXTENSIVELY- FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT THAT'S THAT'S ASPIRATIONAL SAYING THAT IS GOING TO THAT THAT'S ESTIMATED TO COST ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND THERE'S NO FUNDING. FROM ANY SOURCE COMING IN FOR THAT THAT'S GONNA REQUIRE PHILANTHROPIC AND OTHER SOURCES ON THE GROUND IT'S KIND OF A LONG TERM ASPIRATIONAL AS MUCH SO HOPE THAT WAS HELPFUL TO YOU THAT ACTUALLY WAS VERY HELPFUL AND- I HAD THE MISFORTUNE DURING MY NINE YEARS ON THE CITY COUNCIL TO HAVE A- HUNDRED YEAR STORM IN THE FIRST SIX WEEKS AND THEN AN EARTHQUAKE DESTROY OUR DOWNTOWN THE. YOUR IN YEARS BETWEEN AND THE FEMA. OF PAYMENT FOR THE FOR DESERVE HAD NOT BEEN. BY THE TIME A LOT OF THEM BY THE OF THIS DOES. SO UNDER HOW. OF THAT PROCESS TAKES UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT ARE YOU ARE MAKING PROJECTIONS AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS AS SORT OF THE PLOT NUMBER BASED ON ONCE INSURANCE AND FEMA AND OTHER THINGS CALM. BUT WE ARE ALSO IN A UNIQUE BUDGET SITUATION THIS YEAR WHERE THERE WILL BE PRIORITY TO ONE TIME EXPENDITURES AND NOT ON GOING EXPENDITURES AND SO I WOULD HOPE. THAT YOU AGREE ON THIS AND GIVE US THE CHANCE TO HELP YOU THIS YEAR IF SOME OF US ON THE COMMITTEE WANT TO DO THAT AS WE MOVE TOWARD. THE DECISION MAKING IN MAY SO I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT YOU UPDATE THESE NUMBERS MAKE THEM CLEAR IF THERE WAS A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION MAY DID IT BE DONE IN A WAY THAT IT COULD SURVIVE YEARS AND MAKE SURE THAT IT. IF MAJOR GAP ONE HOWEVER THESE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES COME IN. AND I WOULD JUST HOPE. THAT FINANCE IN AND AWAY- WOULD WORK WITH YOU ON THAT JUST SO THAT. THAT WE COULD TRY TO GET TO UNITED FRONT ON WHAT THE FACTS ARE IF IN FACT WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND I IS ONE OF THREE MEMBERS WOULD. TOWARD THE OFFICE. OF THE MAY. REVISE WITH THAT FOR MY QUESTIONS IN MY ME GO TIME. ASK YOUR FIRST PER BOAT AND- THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. SO. A QUESTION FOR THE CSU I'M JUST GONNA CURIOUS ON HOW YOU PLAN TO PRIORITIZE THE PROPOSED BASED INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. GIVEN THE IDEA AND HOW YOU PLAN ON DOING THAT. IT WOULDN'T WHAT IT WILL DO IS WE WILL BE PRIORITIZING A LOT OF. ITEMS THAT ARE MORE MANDATORY NATURE CONSTANTLY KNOWS ABSOLUTELY SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS MENTIONED IN YOUR AGENDA ITEMS. A NUMBER OF THOSE. A NUMBER OF THOSE BUDGET PRIORITIES ONE OF THOSE BEING- THAT TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WE SPOKE ABOUT BETWEEN THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION C. ISSUE ABOUT EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF COSTS SINCE THE WITH THAT- DENTISTRY FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEAR. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MANDATORY COSTS WILL BE COVERING A MENTION HEALTHCARE- WHENEVER WE DO BRING ON BUILDINGS IN THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE SENATOR BUT- HERE'S AGO WE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF. EITHER REFURBISHING OR BRING ON NEW FACILITIES AND WITH THAT ONCE THOSE BUILDINGS ARE FINISHEDAND WE HAVE OUR FINAL PUNCH LIST DONE. VIED AND ALLOW. FOR LACK OF WORK FOR CAMP FOR K. TO. ACTUALLY OPERATE. AND MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES SO WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WOULD BE ALLOCATING TWO CAMPUSES TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CAMPUS BUILDINGS ARE ACTUALLY OPERATIONAL AND INTERNALIZED ON AND WATER ON RIGHT. SO THE NUMBER OF THOSE VERY- BREAD AND BUTTER SORT OF ITEMS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO PAY FOR. AND THEN AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE BUDGET. CYCLE IN AS WE GET TO A FINAL BUDGET PACKAGE NOT KNOWING WHAT THE FINAL NUMBER IS. FROM YOU IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE GOVERNOR. WILL BE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT OTHER AREAS CAN WE INVEST IN OF THE TRUSTEES BUDGET PRIORITIES. SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS LIKE THE GRADUATION THIS YEAR YOUR BASIC NEEDS. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION COSTS WE ANTICIPATE YES THERE ARE A GRIEVANCE THAT ARE SETTLED WITH OTHER UNITS- THERE ARE A FEW OTHER ITEMS. NOT DISABILITIES WE'LL HAVE TO. TAKE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY LIKE WE ALWAYS DO EVERY YEAR I MEAN WE- RARELY HAVE HAD OUR BUDGET REQUEST FULLY FUNDED OBVIOUSLY WE'D LOVE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN THIS YEAR BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GUYS HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES. AND THEN WE JUST HAVE TO RATION WE JUST HAVE TO RATION THOSE PARTIES AS WELL AS RATION CAMPUSES SO. I HOPE THAT'S AT LEAST- INDICATION OF SOME OF THE INITIAL THINGS THAT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE SPENDING THAT SPENDING ON BUT THEN ALSO AN INDICATION OF OTHER THINGS THT WE WILL BE MAKING DECISIONS ARE RARE. BUDGET. ACTIS FINALIZED. THANK YOU SIR SO. HE WILL BE TAKING ALL OF THESE FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS FACULTY SALARY INCREASES AN OLDER. OTHER SALARY INCREASES IN OTHER OPERATING COST IN CONSIDERATION OF PRIORITIZING THE MONIES. NOW THIS QUESTION IS FOR THE L. A. L. BUT I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT IN YOUR OPINION- THE GOVERNOR'S REGISTERED ACTUALLY PRIORITIZED ONE OF THESE AREAS FOR ITS BASE FUNDING. YOUR QUESTION I APOLOGIZE IF I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS AND I'M PROVIDING UNRESTRICTED BASE INCREASE OF 5% AND SO IT'LL LAST YEAR'S YEAR TO. USE ITS DISCRETION TO PRIORITIZE IN THE WAYS THAT MY COLLEAGUES JUST ARM HAS DESCRIBED. CONDITION IS RATHER THAN PROVIDING UNRESTRICTED BASING CREASE. IN THE LEGISLATURE IDENTIFY WHICH SPECIFIC COST INCREASES SUCH AS THE ONE DECIDED FROM YOUR AGENDA IT WISHES TO SUPPORT. AND THEN TALLY UP THE ASSOCIATED COSTS PRESS BASED ON FUTURE COST ESTIMATES AND USE THAT TO DETERMINE THE SIZE TO BE SUPPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS- SO. AB BEST TO DATE THEY PRIORITIZE CERTAIN AREAS THEY WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE CAN WE DO ALL OF THEM WHEN WE CONSIDER THE BASE FUNDING. FILL IN YOUR NINE DAY STARTING AT THE BOTTOM AT AGE TWENTY. THREE PROVIDED FOR NUMBER IS THAT SATURDAY SOMETHING IF YOU COST ESTIMATE. FOR DOING EACH OF THOSE FOUR EXTRA STUFF ITEMS. AND WHILE I CAN'T GET A MENTAL MATH OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. AND DEBT WE DID. FIND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED APPLICATION LEVEL. AS TWO HUNDRED ONE MILLION FIVE PERCENT. WOULD LIKELY BE ENOUGH TO COVER. SAID BULLETED ITEMS AS IT REGARDS AS IT RELATES TO EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND AS OTHER. I'M COSTS BUSINESS JUST TRYING TO FIND THINGS LIKE MAINTENANCE. AND OPERATING EXPENSES AND EQUIPMENT INFLATION. IT WOULD ALSO BE ENOUGH TO COVER THAT SALARY INCREASES INCLUDED IN THE AGREEMENT LANDSCAPES FACULTY. AND WE THINK THAT WOULD LIKE LEAVE ENOUGH FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE PER INCREASE IN SALARY FOR OTHER NON OF. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION BUT I'M GONNA WAIT- I WOULD MAKE SURE I HAVE A ANDERSON THIS BEFORE I ASK SO- OKAY. YEAH OF GIVE THIS BACK TO US INNER LAYER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEN. THANK YOU CHAIRED BY. I THANK YOU CHIRLA AND- I JUST WANT TO THE GOVERNOR FOR- THE 5% BASING CREATES I THINK THAT IS CRITICAL FOR US TO- PORTION- I KIND OF THINK OF THE CSU'S IN AND HIRE A GENERALLY IS- SUBJECT TO THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF LOCAL CONTROL THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. OFTEN LOOKS TO IN ALLOCATING- BUDGET FUNDS. IT IS CERTAINLY I THINK THIS YES ARE BETTER POSITIONED AND THEN. WE OR THE GOVERNOR TO TRY TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO SOME OF THEIR DIFFERENT NEEDS AND- I THINK. IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE WE'VE GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT BASED INCREASE I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THESE FUNDS. MY QUESTION HERE. AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY FOR MR STORM OR SOMEONE ELSE FROM CSU. I EASE YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT. I WANTED TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON THAT IN AND SEE IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND SIR WHAT WAS CAUSING THIS AND TO WHAT DEGREE. THAT THE CRIME WAS DRIVEN BY SHORT TERM COVERAGE RELATED FACTORS VERSUS LONGER TERM MORE STRUCTURAL FACTORS. IN I GUESS I JUST START BY ASKING DO WE HAVE ANY DATA GENERALLY ON. LIKE WHAT VARIABLES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES OR DECLINES IN ENROLLMENT- TO MAYBE I'LL START THERE. AND I BELIEVE THAT MR STORM'S GOING TO HAND OUT TO MISSION OKAY. THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU I THINK YOU CENTER MAN- YES- YOU DATE SO THE INFORMATION THAT IS IN THE AGENDA IS CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL FOR THE CSU AND ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES. BUT TO YOUR QUESTION IN TERMS OF GETTING UNDERNEATH THAT WE DO SEE VARIATION BY CAMPUSES- SO FOR EXAMPLE EVEN IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE HAD- AT LEAST TWO CAMPUSES THAT WERE EITHER AT OR ABOVE. THEIR HIGH WATER MARKS FOR ENROLLMENT IN PRIOR YEARS SO- THE OUTCOMES ON CAMPUSES WE SEE DO SEE VARIATION SOME OF THAT IS GEOGRAPHIC SO CAMPUSES THAT ARE- PERHAPS MORE RURAL AND DEPENDED ON STUDENTS FROM OUTSIDE THE REGION POTS AND TO MEET THEIR ENROLLMENT NEEDS. ARE THEIR ENROLLMENT TARGETS. THIS A GREATER TO DOWN SOME OF CAMPUS IN HER AND SO. AREAS THAT THINK THERE'S A NOT ONLY- INVESTIGATION IN OUR SYSTEM BUT IN HIGHER EDUCATION WRIT LARGE- MAYBE AND DURING THAT WINDOW OF TIME WHERE INSTRUCTION WAS LARGELY ONLINE THAT STUDENTS CHOSE TO- MAKE DECISIONS TO REMAIN CLOSER TO HOME SO CLOSER TO POPULATION CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE ALSO- AND AGAIN. THE ACROSS CAMPUSES BUT IT'S ALL SOME DECLINES IN AVERAGE UNIT LOAD- IT SO WELL AS WELL WE HAD SEEN YEAR OVER YEAR THE AVERAGE UNIT THAT STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN- INCREASING WHICH WAS A PART OF OUR STRATEGY FOR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO GET STUDENTS. TO COMPLETION- MORE QUICKLY- WE SAW A SLIGHT DEEP- DEATH AND THAT AND WE SAW SOME VARIATION BY SPECIFIC STUDENTS SEGMENTS- AGAIN. INVESTIGATING THAT TRYING TO ADDRESS AND AS I MENTIONED IF FOR EXAMPLE IN THE RE ENROLLMENT WORK AT OUR CAMPUSES ARE DOING. THAT'S OFTEN AT A VERY INDIVIDUAL STUDENT- LEVEL TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS PERHAPS THEY DID LEAVE THE UNIVERSITY SO. THERE ARE A VARIETY I THINK WHAT IS ENCOURAGING IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS I MENTIONED. APPLICATIONS FOR A FIRST TIME STUDENTS THAT WOULD BE GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL THIS SPRING- HAVE BOUNCED BACK. AND AROUND 15% ACROSS THE SYSTEM- WE AS AS BY WHAT I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE FROM- OR MAYBEBOTH FROM THE L. A. O. AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REFERENCE- WE ARE WATCHING CLOSELY OR IN IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ABOUT. THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES ACROSS THE STATE WE KNOW AND NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT NATIONWIDE. THAT TWO YEAR COLLEGES SAW THE MOST DRAMATIC DECREASES IN ENROLLMENT AND SO- WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO TRY TO GET BETTER PROJECTIONS- BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY. IN. TERMS OF- GREATER ENROLLMENT OFFER. PROSSER SYSTEM THAT WOULD COME WITH THIS WITH THE- THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. THANKS FOR A QUICK FOLLOW AND MAYBE THE STRAP WITH MORNING ENGLISH- YOU KNOW HOW WHEN I LOOK AT. THE- THAT THE DECLINE IN. AT BOTH COMING COLLEGES AND CSU. I GUESS IT. BACKS WERE OF WHICH IS YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE STAYING HOME MORE AND MAYBE. MORE RELUCTANT TO GO JOIN A VIRTUAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT WHO WANTS TO GO TO SCHOOL LET ALONE A VIRTUAL SCHOOL RIGHT- BUT ALTERNATIVELY YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF IN THE SECOND YEAR OF WHAT IS A VERY INTERESTING LABOR MARKET. AND IT IS CERTAINLY THE LAST I'D SAY SIX MONTHS TO YEAR WE'VE SEEN A VERY TIGHT LABOR MARKET WITH EVER INCREASING WAGES I WAS DRIVING BY AND IN AND OUT THE OTHER DAY AND I SAW. A SIGN FOR TWENTY. MAY NOT AS- NOTHING MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE A PART. JOB BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY GOOD WAGES- CANNOT HERE FAIR ENOUGH. HI I WAS YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF WONDERING- YOU KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE HISTORICALLY. MAYBE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE COVERT SPECIFIC DID I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TO. NAY SENT ITS TO RECENT. BUT YOU KNOW PRESUMABLY YOU GUYS HAVE A SENSE OF LIKE WHAT HAPPENS DURING RECESSIONS AND ECONOMIC BOOMS. I IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE WE HAD A TIGHT LABOR MARKET BUT DO WE TEND TO SEE DECLINES IN ENROLLMENT OR BOARD. NO IMPACTS ARE ONE OF THE FACTS OF. THESE TYPES OF TIGHT LABOR MARKETS ON ENROLLMENT AT CSU'S. SACRAMENTO WONDERFUL QUESTION AND ABSOLUTELY THERE IS A CORRELATION I'M TRADITIONALLY WITH. THE LABOR SITUATION AND THE ECONOMY I'M PARTICULARLY. FOR AT THE TRANSFER STUDENT POPULATION AND POST BACK- THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY CHOOSE NOT. TO EAT TO EITHER DELAY. OR TO STOP OUT. I'M IN THOSE STUDENT CATEGORIES WHEN THERE IS A VERY TIGHT LABOR MARKET BECAUSE THOSE- THE COST BENEFIT. IN THE MARK DATA DELAYED MARKET TIME. YOU TEARS YOUR AND DRIVING. AND TRYING TO DO THE HARD. I DON'T. MANY OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IN IN SORT OF ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT HAVE SORT OF FLYING OUT THE WINDOW DURING THE PANDEMIC I DON'T THINK THAT'S JUST FOR THE CSU I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING AND HEARING THAT FROM. OUR COLLEAGUES FROM UNIVERSITIES AND INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE AS I MENTIONED WE ACTUALLY BUCKED THE NATIONAL TREND IN THE PRECEDING FALL THE FIRST BALL OF THE PANDEMIC AND ACTUALLY HAD RECORDS CSU ENROLLMENT AND I ACTUALLY SAW INCREASES IN TRANSFER STUDENTS. AT A TIME WHEN THEN- THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT LAYOFFS AND SO NOT EVERYTHING WAS LINING UP AS IT S IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN OTHER. OKAY RECESSIONS AND DURING A VERY STRONG ECONOMIC TIMES AND LABOR MARKET SO. IT'S A LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO READ. WHAT THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT WILL BE BUT CERTAINLY FOR CERTAIN STUDENT POPULATIONS THAT- A CRITICAL IS A TRANSFER STUDENTS AND POST BACCALAUREATE STUDENTS. THEY'RE THEY'RE- WEIGHING BACK COST BENEFIT OF GOING INTO THE LABOR MARKET IS SOMETHING THAT MAY BE OF HIGHER. IMPORTANCE RIGHT NOW. SO FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU- WE SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE GETTING THIS WRONG A LITTLE BIT AND AT LEAST FOR LIKE THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE'RE GOING TO SEE A- DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT BEYOND WHAT WE'RE- PROJECTING RIGHT NOW. WILL BE THE IMPACT STRUCTURALLY ON YOUR BUDGET- AND WHAT WOULD THAT IMPLY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS WHERE WE SHOULD DIRECT RESOURCES DURING WHAT IS A- YOU KNOW. AN UNUSUAL SECULAR HI HERE AS FAR AS OUR BUDGET SITUATION. ANOTHER IS WHAT WHICH WE SPEND THIS MONEY. ASSEMBLY WANNA HELP THE CSU'S- YOU KNOW PROP UP THINGS. BUT ASSUMING ALSO THAT WHEN THEY SEE MAYBE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS- DECLINES IN ENROLLMENTS WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. WELL IF I COULD TAKE THAT- I THINK ONE THING I NEED TO STEP BACK AND- EXPLAIN SOMETHING FIRST SENATOR SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW ENROLLMENT WORKS FUNDAMENTALLY FROM A BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE. SO SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CSU. THERE'S BEEN THIS CONTRACT ESSENTIALLY BETWEEN THE C. ISSUE IN STATE. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENED FOR MANY DECADES AND ABOUT A COUPLE DECADES AGO THIS MODEL WAS A LITTLE BIT OF JUSTICE BUT THE IDEA WAS THAT. FOR EVERY STUDENT THAT WE ADD WORK EDUCATE WE WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO EDUCATE. IN OVER THE LAST SIX DECADES WE HAVE INCREMENTALLY RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE STATE TO EDUCATE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND THAT'S CALLED WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL OF US WHO ARE ON THE PANEL HERE TALKING ABOUT OUR FUNDED ENROLLMENT FOR OUR ROLE THAT TARGETS SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE FUNDED AT THIS LEVEL RIGHT NOW TO EDUCATE. THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS NOW YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE HERE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT. WAS LINKED TO AN AGREEMENT LAST YEAR THAT SAID HEY C. ISSUE YOU'RE GONNA EDUCATE AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THE FUNDING EDUCATE. NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR. MORE STUDENTS THERE'S A THERE'S A PROBLEM NOW WITH THIS AND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE F. ING WORLD IT DIPS OKAY WHAT IF IT ACTUALLY DOES. WELL AS YOU KNOW AND AS MY COLLEAGUE DR EVANS WOULD SAY. ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT IS BOTH AN ART AND A SCIENCE WE'RE GONNA BE TIMES WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE STUDENTS THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR OFFER TO BE ADMITTED TO UNIVERSITY AND THERE ARE OTHER TIMES ARE GOING TO BE BELOW THAT KNOW THEORETICALLY THERE MIGHT BE A DEBT. IN TERMS OF STUDENTS WHO WANTED TO BE AT EDUCATED AT THE C. ISSUE. NOW WHEN IT COMES TO OUR TARGET IN WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW WE'RE REALLY PRETTY WHAT WERE WHAT. AT THIS POINT WE ARE AT ONE OF THE CLOSEST POINTS WE'VE THEN IN TERMS OF OUR ACTUAL ROLE WITH. TO OUR FUNDED TARGET. SO I THINK IT'S JUST A THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS FOR ME IF I'M WRONG IN. MY COLLEAGUES NODDING HIS HEAD. SO WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO BEING RIGHT OUT THAT OPTIMAL NOW. NOW HERE'S THE CRYSTAL BALL PARK THAT'S DIFFICULT. DO YOU ADD THIS ADDITIONAL EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN ORDER FOR US TO EDUCATE MORE AND DO WE ARE WE GET HAVE THAT STRONG OF. A DEMAND FROM THE STUDENTS TO BE EDUCATING THEM THAT'S A TOUGH CALL TO MAKE BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SEE ON THE TRANSFER SIDE- WORST SIR ARE NOT AS ROBUSTLY. SEEKING TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY. NOW IF YOU DO DECIDE ULTIMATELY SAY WELL LET'S LET'S LET'S BACK OFF DISAGREEMENTS LET'S HYPOTHETICALLY. YOU COULD REDIRECT SOME OF THAT FUNDING TO OTHER THINGS LIKE GRADUATION THIS YEAR. SO YEAH WHILE IT MIGHT NOT BE A HUMONGOUS ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR OUR CAMPUSES. I ANTICIPATED. YOU COULD HAVE A GUARANTEE THAT THERE WILL BE MONEY THAT WILL BE DEDICATED TO GRAB CHIPS THE CURRENT LOT OF STUDENTS SO THAT THEY CAN GET JUST ALL THE COURSES THEY NEED TO DO THAT. BUT AS FOR OUR PLANNING GOES WE'RE MARCHING FORWARD WITH THE IDEA THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. BUT MEASURES TO PROPOSALS ENACTED. THAT WE WILL BE GROWING ARE LED BY THAT NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR. STUDENTS AND WE DO HAVE PRELIMINARY ALLOCATIONS TO ALL A NOT ALL BUT SEVERAL OF OUR CAMPUSES. AND THEY'RE PLANNING TO GROW BY THAT- AND SO THAT'S WHY THE LATE LANDED NOW YOU DO HAVE SO OPTIONS AND I THINK MISS KING AS AS- ARTICULATED PRETTY CLEARLY THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE MAYBE THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD MAKE AT HOME A TARGET. YOU KNOW FOR BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE JUST BECAUSE OF THE SOFT THE SOFTNESS OF THE MOMENT RIGHT NOW- BUT- OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD WE WOULD WE WOULD DO IT EITHER WAY JUST DEPENDS ON ON. ON WHAT YOU'RE DECISIONS WERE BUT- YOU OBVIOUSLY YEAH I CAN- I MOVE OFF OF THAT NINETY FOUR HUNDRED IF YOU CHOSE BUT IT WOULD CREATE A RECALL FOR US BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY INDICATED OVER CAMPUSES THEY SHOULD GO FOR THAT. WE SHOULD BE GOING FOR THAT KIND OF BUILDING GROSS BUT- BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN STEPS THERE ARE SOME. NUANCES LIKE MY COLLEAGUE DR EVANS. TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU RIGHT MR TRUMP. THANK YOU OF SENATOR MEN AND- THAT COMPLETES- FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ON OF TO MOVE TO ISSUE FOR BUT LET ME JUST SAY WE HAVE TWO MORE ISSUES AND THEN WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAVE A HARD STOP BY NOON SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THESE NEXT TWO ISSUES IN A WAY THAT WE CAN ALLOW SOME. TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY- WE WILL HAVE RYAN STORM AGAIN FROM THE CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSITY WILL HAVE A OUR VIRUS AS OF SAN JUAN FROM CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY BUT I DID NOTE THAT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER REFERRED TO HER AS VICE AND ONE SO. WHAT WILL ALLOW HER TO. ANSWER TO WHATEVER SHE ANSWERS TO THEM THEN WILL GO TO JENNIFER LOUIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIALLY SECURING FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO IN THAT ORDER AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH MR STORE. FIVE FOR BREVITY I'VE DEFERRED MY COMMENTS- IN AND ALLOW. PASS I'M SORRY BY SAN JUAN PROVIDE OUR COMMENTS THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE THAT RECORD SETTING PROPERTY ARE WILL MOVE DEVICE AND ONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CARE LAYERED AND- GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING STILL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ONE TIME FUNDING A ONE HUNDRED MILLION TO ADDRESS THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. GIVEN THE EVER GROWING BACKLOG THE CSU TAKES A MULTI PRONGED STRATEGY TO ADDRESS PRIORITY PROJECTS REQUESTED BY TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. THE AGENDA NOTE THE FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG WHICH WE BELIEVE IS ARTIFICIALLY HIGH AS OUR- FUNDED PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT YET COMPLETED. THEY NEED TO BE UPDATED IN OUR ANNUAL DATABASE HOWEVER OUR PROGRESS IN FUNDING PROJECTS IS BEING ERODED BY THE MORE THAN THIRTEEN PERCENT. COST INFLATION EXPERIENCE THIS LAST YEAR AND IT IS STILL OCCURRING AT JUST 1% AT JUST UNDER 1% FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS TO SEE IF YOU WORKS TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG. ONE THE TRUSTEES USE CAPITAL FUNDS TO RENOVATE OR REPLACE EXISTING FACILITIES. THESE FOR THE FACILITY HAVE A NUMBER OF AGE SYSTEMS AND THE FULL RENOVATION. AND ENABLES A COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL. UPSET OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM IS THE SECOND METHOD IF DEVELOPED INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM HIS PROJECT THE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE FUNDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THERE'S USUALLY AN IMPROVEMENT OUR BETTERMENT COMPONENT. TO THE IN INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND EVERY CAMPUS TYPICALLY GET FUNDED WHEN WE GET CAPITAL FUND ADDRESS A BROAD BACKLOG IS TO REQUEST DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING FROM THE STATE. SUCH AS A HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THEN FOR THE CAMPUS LEASE OPERATING FUNDS TO KING LATER A RESERVE IT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T NEEDED MAINTENANCE RESERVE OR IMPROVEMENT RESERVE. ACCOMPLISH THE PROJECT. WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE INTEREST EARNINGS HAVE BEEN USED TO FUND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS AND THIS LAST YEAR THE EMAIL TOTAL FIFTY FIVE MILLION FROM INTEREST EARNINGS. AND THE LAST IS THE- PENDING NEW BUILDING. I AM TORMENT THAT'S A COMPONENT OF OUR OFFER BUDGET REQUEST AND A COUPLE YEARS BACK WE WENT FROM ABOUT ELEVEN DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT. ABOUT TWENTY BASED ON WHAT CAMPUS ARE ACTUALLY OF FUNDING FOR MAINTENANCE OF PLANT. SO THAT THERE'S NO EASY ANSWER ON THE BACKLOGS OF STRATEGIES RELY ON A REOCCURRING BASIS FUNDS FOR CAPITAL FINANCING OR PATIENT CO. SUCH AS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN THE CSU OPERATING BUDGET REQUESTS FOR BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR WE STICK WITH THE ONE TIME FUNDS. WHERE THE GOVERNOR INCLUDES INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION IN HIS BUDGET THE REQUESTED ONE BILLION IN THE TRUSTEE'S REQUEST. TO SEE IF YOU VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE FUNDING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE LOADING. SUPPORT THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM AND PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS TACKLING STAFF THE SAFE AND FUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT SO WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS WILL MOVE ON TO JENNIFER. LOUIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH S. SENATOR AND MEMBERS- AS MENTIONED EARLIER A PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. OF WHICH A HUNDRED MILLION. IS DEDICATED TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS. EIGHTY THREE MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CEASE YOUR BAKER STILL ENERGY PATIENTS CENTER AND FIFTY MILLION TOWARD SUPPORTING UNIVERSITY FARMS. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I AM AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR FURTHER DTAILS. THANK YOU AND THEN WILL MOVE TO LISA CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THINK DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE ARE PRUDENT USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS AS IT HELPS ADDRESS ISSUES EXISTING BACKLOG AND POTENTIALLY AVOID IT COSTS DOWN IT SAYS HE PLANNED EMERGENCY REPAIRS AND SO FORTH. WHEN USING ONE TIME MONEY FOR THIS PURPOSE THOUGH IS THAT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING CAUSES. WALKER BACKLOGS TEND TO EMERGE WHEN ON AND ON BASIS CAMPUSES ARE NOT SETTING ASIDE ENOUGH FUNDING FROM THEIR SUPPORT BUDGETS FOR MAINTENANCE AND RENEWAL ACTIVITIES. CONTACTS YOU SEE WAS ASKED ME AT ITS CAMPUSES WE NEED TO SPEND A COMBINED TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION ANNUALLY OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IN ORDER DRAFT MAINTENANCE AND RENEWAL NEEDS AND KEEP THE BACKLOGFROM GROWING. AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN ITS ESTIMATED TO CURRENTLY BE SPENDING. HI WITH THIS IN MIND% WE WOULD RECOMMEND YOU CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS A STARTING POINT. WE WOULD RECOMMEND PROVIDING THE ONE TIME FUNDS AS A HUNDRED MILLION AS POST. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING COMES AVAILABLE YOU COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING EVEN MORE. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WOULD ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO BEGIN THINKING ABOUT A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO ADDRESS ISSUES ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND RENEWAL NEEDS. SO THAT THE BACKLOG DOESN'T CONTINUE TO GROW YEAR AFTER YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THEN LET ME. GO TO MY COLLEAGUES FIRST AND SEE IF THERE'S A QUESTION FROM EITHER A SENATOR ROACH- BUG. I WOULD I'M JUST. INTRIGUED ABOUT YOUR COMMENT IN WHICH THE BACKLOG- IT HOW IT INCREASES OVER TIME. WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE I DO WANT TO DO SOMETHING STATUTORILY OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. WE JUST. GUIDE ME ON OUR GUIDE US ON THAT ON THAT POINT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. WE BASIS THERE ARE BUILDING SYSTEMS OF THE CAMPUS SAYS THAT ARE REACHING THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE AND IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE BACKLOG FROM GROWING CAMPUSES NEED TO ON AN ONGOING BASIS SPEND MONEY TERROR WHEN YOU WANT TO PLACE THIS. THE SYSTEM COMPONENTS. BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AMOUNT OF THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVITY WE THINK THAT IT WOULD TAKE SIGNIFICANT PLANNING FOR THE STATE. TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS. IN ABOUT A WEEK FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL BE SHARING A SIMILAR ITEM FOR YOU SEE AND I THINK YOU'RE A VERY SIMILAR STORY WITH PERHAPS EVEN LARGER NUMBERS BACK. THROUGH LEGISLATURE TO ENGAGE IN THIS LONG TERM PLANNING. SB ONTO THE SCOPE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET THIS IS SOMETHING WE COULD WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO FURTHER EXPLORE IN THE FALL FOR EXAMPLE. AND IN THAT FOR THE EXPIRATION. SOME QUESTIONS HE COULD CONSIDER INCLUDE. BUT FUND SOURCES FIRST THESE ON NEED. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE AND- OF THOSE FUNDS. AND WHAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS YOU MIGHT WANT TO IMPLANT INSURE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS ARE HAVING TO INTENDED EFFECT. I HOPE THAT HELPS WITH SOME OF THE INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND- WE EXPECT WOULD LIKELY BE ACTED PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PLANNING PROCESS TO ADDRESS THIS NEED. SIGNIFICANT IN DAY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE FOR YOUR COMMENTS. FROM SENATOR MEANT. YES SEVEN COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR CSU- FIRST THAT YEAH I THINK THIS IS IN A REPORT AND WE CAN REITERATE IT OUT WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE HOLE UP THAT ACROSS THE CSU SYSTEM ACCORDING YOUR ESTIMATES. I WOULD AFFECT BASED ON INFLATION SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR POINT SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BACKLOG GUYS SO THIS IS THIS IS REALLY A DROP IN THE BUCKET AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS SHOVEL READY LIKE THAT. THAT COULD BE STARTED RIGHT AWAY. BUT WE'VE WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A LIST OF ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WE WOULD TRY TO MOVE TO THOSE TO CONSTRUCTION ON THOSE OF QUICK AS WE CAN. BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THEY'RE ALL SHOVEL READY. OKAY SO BILLION WOULD LIKE. GIVE ME A TIME WHEN THEY COULD BE STARTED NEXT YEAR OR WOULD BE LONGER THAN THAT. IF YOU START IN THE NEXT YEAR. GOT IT AND THEN I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR L. A- IS IT RIGHT MY UNDERSTOOD THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE DOES NOT COUNT AGAINST AGAIN LIMIT. I EIGHT ANYONE HAS THE EXPERTISE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YEP MY QUESTION SENATOR. YES CURRENTLY IS A MINISTRATION IS TREATING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AS AN EXCLUSION FROM THE GAMELAN FROM FEDERAL AND ANY FUNDS PROVIDED FOR THIS PURPOSE WHICH WOULD NOT COUNT TOWARD THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS THE NEXT. TO ANY YEAR WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE WELL OVER AGAIN LIMIT THIS WOULD SEEM LIKE A VERY PRUDENT USE OF FUNDS AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION. YEAH WHICH HELP CONTINUE TO RAISE AS WE MOVE FORWARD FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OTHERS THIS IS WHY NOT TAKE MORE OF THIS SURPLUS FUNDING PRETTY SINCE IT DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST AGAIN LIMIT AND USE IT TOWARDS THIS TYPE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. AND WASTE A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS VALUES ON- YOU KNOW GETTING TO ZERO EMISSIONS I IN WAYS THAT- HELP TO RESTORE- ONE OF THE CROWN. JEWELS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. HI THE WORK FOR OF ED I THINKING. THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY. USE OF FUNDS AND I WAS OUT FRANKLY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE SUCH A LOW NUMBER I FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HERE. THANK YOU- THAT COMPLETE YOUR COMMENTS WERE MADE JUST SAY THAT- THAT OUT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THEY WERE ASKED BY MY COLLEAGUES SO I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND WE WILL JUST LOOK AT THIS. AS IT MOVES TOWARD A MAY AND JUST REPEAT. THE WHOLE NOTION THAT THIS MAY WELL BE A BUDGET THAT. ARE THAT IS ABLE TO DO SOME GOOD THINGS THAT ARE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES AND SOME OF THIS WOULD BE A LOGICAL THING FOR THAT AND THAT- CENTER MEN'S ADMONITION ABOUT THE GAM LIMIT WAS VERY APPROPRIATE SO. WE'LL JUST LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING MORE THAT IS IN THE MAY REVISE. OUR WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR LAST ISSUE. WHICH IS STUDENT HOUSING UPDATE SENATE'S RYAN STORM FROM CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OF AYE SAN JUAN FROM CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AND THEN REBEKAH KIRK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE WILL GO IN THAT ORDER AND START WITH RAIN STORM. YEAH I ASK MY COLLEAGUE BY SEN WANT TO MINOR COM. YOU BROKE YOUR- RECORD FOR BREVITY SO WE WILL MOVE ON TO A VICE AND WON'T. EARLIER THIS IS YOUR PREACH THE PRECIADO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES ACCEPTANCE VERY BY SUBMITTAL FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM. OUR REGIONAL TO MIDDLE THOUGHT 1100% GRANT FUNDING AND AFTER WE LEARNED WE READ. READ THIS READ THE PROGRAM GUIDELINES WE RAN MULTIPLE FINANCIAL PLANS IN ORDER TO ROUTE SUBMIT REVISED DOCUMENT JUST LAST WEEK PROPOSING PROJECTS WITH 65% GRANT FUNDING. AND 35% CSU CO FUNDING. WE SUBMITTED TEN PROJECTS FUNDED THROUGH A MIX OF THESE TWO SOURCES. AND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION WE'RE SEEKING GRANT PROGRAM FUNDING. THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT STAYED THE SAME THE CHANGE WITHOUT THE CO FUNDING TO STRETCH THE STATE HOUSING GRANTS BY LOWERING THE COST. PER BED. FROM THE GRANT AND ECO FUNDING ALSO ENABLED US TO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL PROJECT FOR CONSIDERATION IF YOU SACRAMENTO. WE WENT FROM NINE PROJECTS SUBMITTED TO TEN. FIFTY TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CSU TARGET APPROPRIATION OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. IS INCREASED TO A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION AND- ALSO SIXTY SIX. BECAUSE AT FOUR CAN'T. IF FORTY NINETEEN MILLION AS FUNDED WHICH EXCEEDS THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO YOUR TARGET BUDGET THOUSAND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY NINTH AFFORDABLE BEDS WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED AT EIGHT CAMPUSES. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CAMPUS IS ON THE POTENTIAL FOR THIRD YEAR THE PROGRAM. AND SEEK GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THE PROGRAM GUIDELINES TO INCLUDE THE SILLY RENOVATIONS IN CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT USE EXISTING AVAILABLE HELPING FACE. TO MAKE THEM IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS. BUT THE ISSUE IS JUST STARTING THE PROCESS TO FURTHER DEVELOP OUR STUDENTS HELPING PLAN TO COMPLY WITH NEW REQUIREMENTS IN THE EDUCATION CODE FROM AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. WILL BE CONDUCTING A NEEDS ASSESSMENT BY CAMPUS THAT PROJECTS UP 222-000-2620 SEVEN. THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PROJECTED ENROLLMENT GROWTH OR CHANGES AND THE GOAL TO CLOSE THE DEGREE GAP. WORK WILL INCLUDE CANVASES WILL MEET PROJECTED HOUSING NEED BY INCLUDING ANY STATE HOUSING GRANTS OR CSE FUNDING IS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS IN THE CSU. WE ANTICIPATE THE PLAN WILL INCLUDE SPECIAL POPULATIONS. SUCH AS THOSE NEEDING EMERGENCY SHELTER OR RAPID RE HOUSING. AND FOSTER YOU. THE FIRST REPORT IS DUE JULY TWENTY TWO AND THEN EVERY THREE YEARS THEREAFTER. CANCELAR ANXIOUSLY FORWARD WITH POTENTIAL GRANT PROJECTS GIVEN THE CONTINUED COST ESCALATION. AND FIFTY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND THEN WE'LL GO TO REBEKAH KIRK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU REBECCA KIRK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE WERE PLEASED TO SEE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT OF COURSE ESTABLISHED THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM TO INCREASE THE STOCK OF AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING. AT UC CSU AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE PROGRAM STATUTE APPROPRIATED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE SORRY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WHICH INCLUDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR PLANNING GRANTS TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE S. IT ALSO INCLUDED INTENT LANGUAGE FOR APPROPRIATIONS OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE SUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEARS REPRESENTING A TOTAL OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. THE TWENTY TWENTY TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE SECOND YEAR APPROPRIATION TOWARD THE PLANS TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PROGRAM. WE RECEIVED AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN APPLICATIONS IN THE INITIAL FILING AROUND. REQUESTING MORE THAN THREE POINT TWO BILLION IN STATE FUNDING. THE NEXT STEP FOR THIS PROGRAM IS THAT BY MARCH FIRST TE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL PROVIDE THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WITH A LIST OF PROJECTS PROPOSED FOR INCLUSION IN THE BUDGET ACT OR OTHER LEGISLATION. FROM THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. ONE NOTE THAT I WOULD MENTION IS THAT ALTHOUGH THE STATUTE ESTABLISHES PERCENTAGE SHARES FOR EACH OF THE SEGMENTS. SPECIFICALLY 50% FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES 30% FOR THE CSU AND 20% FOR THE UC. THOSE PERSONS SEGMENT SHARES APPLIED TO THE OVERALL TWO BILLION ENVISIONED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND NOT NECESSARILY TO EACH INDIVIDUAL YEAR'S APPROPRIATION LEVEL. HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION THANK YOU THANK YOU OF I'M GOING TO JUST MAKE A COMMENT. AT THE BEGINNING HERE AND THAT IS I SPOKE TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WEEK YESTERDAY AND THEN MAP WITH A NUMBER OF TRUSTEES AFTERWARDS. AND THEY WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES I'VE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT AND SOME OF THE REGENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT IT AND WE HAVE CSU HERE. AND THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT OF THIS PROGRAM IS OVER SUBSCRIBED ALREADY AND IT'S IN ITS FIRST YEAR AND THERE IS A BIG DEMAND AS I MOVED TO THE DISTRICT AROUND THE STATE DURING THE INTERIM. THE WHOLE LEVEL OF HOUSING AND SECURITY AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS PHENOMENAL AND SO. I REALLY APPRECIATE CSU PAWNING REALLY APPRECIATE THE MAXIMIZING WHATEVER THEY CAN GET AND I KNOW THERE WAS A BLIP AND SORT OF HOW THIS UNFOLDED. AT CSU AND I JUST HOPE AS WE WORK THROUGH ALL THREE BRANCHES AND GET REPORTS JUST LIKE THIS FROM THE OTHER TWO BRANCHES. THAT THE FINANCE. DEPARTMENT WILL REALLY ASSESS- BECAUSE A ANECDOTE I HEARD THERE WERE THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF APPLICATIONS FOR WHAT IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS AND THAT SNAP. AND SO I WOULD HOPE THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT. THE AMOUNT IT'S BEEN APPLIED FOR WHETHER IT HAS SOME VALIDITY. WHETHER THIS INDICATES ARE OF. A DEMAND IT'S MUCH GREATER THAN- MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE AND ALLOWS US TO ADDRESS THIS MAY REVISED IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE THE FACTS IN FRONT OF US SO- I APPRECIATE THE REPORT. WONDER WHY THAT OUT THEN ONE TO ASK IF EITHER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAD ANY QUESTIONS NON FROM- FROM THEM SO WE JUST KNOW MY COMMENTS I APPRECIATE.
