AND LOOKING FOR ANOTHER PRODUCTIVE DAY AT THIS POINT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR I LIKE TO CALL ON SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT OF PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MOMENTS AND JUST SHORT MOMENTS TO BRING OUR ATTENTION TO THE SOLEMN THIS OF THIS PARTICULAR DAY. OF NINE ELEVEN. AND IT'S REALLY A DIFFICULT THING TO COME UP WITH TO SAY. DO YOU CELEBRATE NINE ELEVEN DO YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE PROPER TERM DO YOU MOURN NINE ELEVEN. DO YOU COMMEMORATE NINE ELEVEN. AND. I WOULD LIKE TO STAND TODAY TO REMEMBER NINE ELEVEN. AND GROWING UP AS A CHILD. A PARTICULAR DAY THAT MY PARENTS SHARED WITH ME OFTEN IS A WHERE THEY WERE IN NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WHEN PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN DALLAS TEXAS. AND I THINK FOR OUR GENERATION TODAY. THAT DAY IS SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ONE. AND I REMEMBER THAT DAY VERY CLEARLY. I WORKED ABOUT FIVE MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE AND ARRIVED AT MY OFFICE AT ABOUT SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING AND HADN'T HAD THE NEWS HONOR OR ANYTHING ELSE AND I WAS THE FIRST ONE IN THE OFFICE THAT DAY WE HAD A BIG SCREEN TV AND IN ONE OF THE OFFICES AND I GOT A PHONE CALL. AND ALL IT SAID WAS TURN ON THE TV. THAT'S WHY ONE OF THE OFFICE I TURN ON THE TV. AND. RIGHT THERE ON THE TELEVISION OR WOW THE TWIN TOWERS ONE OF THEM A BLAZE AND ON FIRE. AND THEN AS I WAS WATCHING AT THE SECOND ONE WAS STRUCK AND HIT. AS I WAS WATCHING A LIVE ON TELEVISION. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE DAY THAT. OF COURSE NONE OF US WILL EVER FORGET. AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE A HABIT OF YOU KNOW PUTTING THOSE KIND OF YOU KNOW ONCE WE LIVED THROUGH THE MOMENT AND GET THROUGH IT. WE KIND OF PUT IT ASIDE AND DON'T PAY. VERY MUCH MORE ATTENTION TO IT. BUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO AT THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY FAIR THEY HAD A TRAVELING NINE ELEVEN MUSEUM. WITH SOME OF THE ARTIFACTS FROM THE NEW YORK MUSEUM. AND THEN I WAS REMINDED OF IT THIS MORNING. AND IF YOU'VE NOT DONE THIS I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE THE TIME YOU CAN YOU SEE IT AND HEAR MOST OF THEM. ONLINE NOWADAYS. BUT LISTEN TO THE PHONE CALLS. THE FINAL PHONE CALLS. I HAVE A HUSBAND CALLING THEIR WIVES. GOV WHY HE'S CALLING THEIR HUSBANDS. MONTHS THEIR KIDS. HEY BABY. I'M ON AN AIRPLANE. AND WE'VE BEEN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. THAT I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU BABY. TELL THE KIDS. TELL MY PARENTS. I HOPE I GET TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I THINK THE SOLOMON AS OF THE DAY. BECOMES MORE TRUE. AND MORE REAL. AS YOU LISTEN TO THOSE PHONE CALLS. FROM THOSE AIRPLANES. JUST PRIOR TO THEM CRASHING INTO THE BUILDINGS ARE CRASHING INTO THE FIELD IN PENNSYLVANIA. AND I HOPE THAT WE ALL WILL BE ABLE TO SAY. THAT WE WILL NEVER FORGET. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU CENTER JONES GENERAL ROCK. YOU KNOW IN. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND ONE I WAS I WAS IN FACT TO. THE GENERAL. LONG TIME AGO IT SEEMS AND I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE PENTAGON AND I HAD A TEAM OF FOLKS WHO. SOMEWHERE RESERVISTS PART TIMERS SOMEWHERE FULL TIMERS. OUR OFFICE OUR LITTLE OFFICE WAS ON THE IN THE SEBRING IN THOSE YOU'VE BEEN TO THE PENTAGON KNOW THAT. IN THE RING YOU GET WINDOWS AND- THE RINGS YOUR. RINGS AND AS YOU GO AND MOVE IN WORD YOU DON'T HAVE WINDOWS YOU HAVE LITTLE OFFICES AND IN FACT OUR OFFICE. WAS IN THE OLD. CAFETERIA AREA IN THESE FOOD PREPARATION AREA IN FACT I STILL REMEMBER THE THOSE YOURS OLD AS I AM MAY REMEMBER GREEN. TILES THOSE LINOLEUM TYPE TILE THAT WE USED TO SEE IN SCHOOLS AND THAT'S HOW I KNEW WERE MY OFFICE WAS IF I EVER GOT LOST I LOOK FOR THE GREEN TILE. SO I HAD A CREW IN THERE AND THE PENTAGON ON SEPTEMBER ELEVEN. I WAS ACTUALLY IS A PART TIMER I HAD ENOUGH IS THERE BUT I ALSO HAD A LAW PRACTICE IN RIVERSIDE AND I. WE WORKED PART TIME IN THE PENTAGON. MY BOSS AT THE TIME WAS THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL AND I WAS ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO MEET UP WITH HIM. A DAY OR SO BEFORE AND BE THERE ON DUTY TO. GO ON ONE TRIP OR ANOTHER I CAN'T REMEMBER. BUT FRANKLY I HAD SOMETHING COME UP IN LAW PRACTICE AND I HAD TO CANCEL THAT TRIP. BUT I REMEMBER AS MY COLLEAGUE. FROM CITY AB COUNTY% JUST RECOUNTED I REMEMBER GETTING DRESSED FOR THIS LAW THING THAT I HAD TO DO IN THE MORNING I FORGET EXACTLY WHAT TIME WAS SO. EIGHT SOMETHING. AND I REMEMBER WATCHING THE PLANES GO INTO THE TOWERS. AND THEN THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER IS HEARING ABOUT A PLANE THAT WENT INTO THE PENTAGON. AND THE FOLKS THAT WORKED FOR ME WERE IN THE PENTAGON THAT THAT DAY. NOW. FORTUNATELY FOR THEM THE PENTAGON WITH ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE IS BIG IS OF CITY OF NORCO IN MY SENATE DISTRICT. WHAT THEY FELT WAS THE BUILDING MOVE WHICH IMAGINE THE PENTAGON MOVING. THE ALARMS GOING OFF THE SMELL OF SMOKE AND THEN SOME SMOKE THAT EVENTUALLY MOVED THROUGH THE CORNERS. AND PEOPLE TELLING THEM TO EVACUATE AND LEADING THEM. LEADING THEM FROM THEIR OFFICES DOWN TO THE COURTYARD AND OUTSIDE OF THE PENTAGON. SO THEY WERE VERY VERY FORTUNATE TEN AND THEY SPOKE TO ME ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE AND EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT INJURED IN ANY WAY. THEY SPEND DAYS OUTSIDE OF THE PENTAGON THEIR CARS LEFT IN THE PARKING LOT. THEY WERE TRAUMATIZED BY THAT PARTICULAR EVENTS. THE COLONEL THE CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT AND SOME OTHERS. BUT THEY WERE VERY VERY LUCKY BECAUSE OTHERS WERE NOT SO FORTUNATE. MY IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR WAS TRAPPED IN LONDON AT THE TIME HE WAS OVER ON A NAVY MISSION BECAUSE HIS CIVILIAN JOB WAS THE DEPUTY. GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY. BUT HIS VERY CLOSE FRIEND. WAS THE CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE MARINE CORPS AND HIS OFFICE UNFORTUNATELY WAS RIGHT ABOVE WHERE THE PLANE WENT INTO THE PENTAGON AND KILL THE ARMY THREE STAR GENERAL WHO WAS CHIEF OF ARMY PERSONNEL. AND IN TALKING TO THIS GENTLEMAN A CIVILIAN LAWYER WHO WAS THE CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE MARINE CORPS. HE HAD QUITE AN EXPERIENCE. IT RIPPED THE FLOOR OUT FROM UNDER HIS OFFICE HE COULD LOOK DOWN INTO THE FLAMES THAT WERE CAUSED BY THE PLANE BUT HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF HIS OFFICE BECAUSE THE IMPACTED JAMMED THE OFFICE DOOR AND HE WAS TRAPPED. FORTUNATELY FOR HIM. HE WAS ASSIGNED BECAUSE OF HIS ELEVATED POSITION. THE MOST BURLY OF MARINE CORPS NCOS WHO TOOK THE DOOR AND RIPPED THE DOOR OFF THE HINGES TO GET HIM OUT OF THAT OFFICE. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHER AND MANY MANY OTHERS WE HAD THE AIRFORCE SURGEON GENERAL A THREE STAR GENERAL. RUN OUT HE WAS EVACUATED TO WITH HIS OTHER MEDICAL PERSONNEL. TAKE HIS TIE OFTEN BEGIN TREATING PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT. OF THE PENTAGON. SO THERE WAS NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON ON THIS DAY THE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN WHO WAS UNAFFECTED AND IF YOU STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT. GOING FROM A TIME OF RELATIVE PEACE IN A SENSE. TO A TIME OF ABSOLUTE CONFLICT WE ALL WERE DRAWN INTO THAT SITUATION. WE ALL WERE IMPACTED BY THAT. THE HEROES THAT DAY AND WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO SERVICE HEROES AND THEY ALL OUR HEROES BUT THERE WERE TRUE HEROES THAT DAY PEOPLE WHO RAN BACK INTO THE PENTAGON WITHOUT. THOUGHT OF THEIR OWN SAFETY. TO ATTEMPT TO BRING PEOPLE OUT TO ATTEMPT TO FIND THE NAVY PERSONNEL IN THAT COMMUNICATIONS UNIT. IN ADDITION TO THAT ARMY THREE STAR GENERAL WHO WERE ALSO. KILLED AND SERIOUSLY INJURED BY THE PLANE GOING INTO THE PENTAGON. SO IT'S NOT A DAY THAT GOES BY THAT I DON'T THINK ABOUT. THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN NEW YORK CITY. THE PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED AND EVEN THOSE WHO. WE'RE NOT PHYSICALLY INJURED BUT WERE. IMPACTED MENTALLY. BY THAT PARTICULAR DAY SO. WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THEM WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THOSE IN PENNSYLVANIA. ON THAT PLANE AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO HERE. AS MY COLLEAGUE INDICATED WINNIE. SPOKE ABOUT THE WORDS ABOVE THE DÃ­AS WE ARE HERE TO PRESERVE PEOPLE'S LIBERTY AND HELP TO SELL JUST AS MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. WHETHER IT'S A CIVILIAN UNIFORM OR WHETHER IT'S A MILLION MILITARY UNIFORM DO AROUND THE WORLD EVERY SINGLE DAY. SO I JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN ASKING EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. TO REMEMBER SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES THAT WERE MADE THAT DAY AND TO REMEMBER THE CHALLENGE FRANKLY THAT WAS ISSUED TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF US. TO PRESERVE FREEDOM. TO PRESERVE LIBERTY AND TO NOT LET THOSE FOLKS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES THAT DAY. DO SO IN VAIN. THANK YOU GENERAL ROSS FOR SHARING ALL THAT I THINK WE'D ALSO BE REMISS WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING ALL THE FIRST RESPONDERSCLEARLY THOSE A WIN IN TODAY THE TWIN TOWERS AND THEY'RE STILL RAMIFICATIONS TODAY SO MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED ILL EFFECTS FROM THE FROM THE SUBSTANCES THAT THEY WERE EXPOSED TO AND COURSES AT ADVERSELY AFFECTS THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL.

THAT A JUDGE IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO IMPOSE FOR ANYONE GIVEN SPECIFIC GIVEN PROBATION FOR SPECIFIC LOW LEVEL DRUG RELATED OFFENSES. THIS BILL INSTEAD IT RETURNS A JUDGE'S DISCRETION TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPOSE THIS JAIL TIME AS A CONDITION OF THE KIND INSPIRATION. TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT GET RID OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY COUNTY JAIL TIME. BUT INSTEAD OF IT BEING MANDATORY THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE DISCRETION WHETHER OR NOT TO OPPOSE IT. MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES ARE COSTLY OVERLY PUNITIVE IN AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR DETERRING DRUG RELATED CRIMES. FURTHERMORE INCARCERATING MORE INDIVIDUALS ONLY CONTINUES TO ADD PRESSURE ON ARE ALREADY OVERCROWDED AND BORDERLINE UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRISON FACILITIES. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL STILL ALLOWS JUDGES TO IMPOSE. THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IF THEY THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE.

THEIR BARGES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SENATORS I RISE TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN TWENTY ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER NIZARI IN THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE BOARDS OF CALPERS AND CAL STIRS TO DIVEST PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT FUNDS FOR MANY INVESTMENT VEHICLE OWNED BY THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY. THE LIQUIDATION OF INVESTMENTS IN TURKEY IS CONTINGENT UPON THE PASSAGE OF A FEDERAL LAW ISSUING SANCTIONS AGAINST TURKEY FOR FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. THIS CONTINGENCY CLAUSE INJURES CALIFORNIA'S POLICY TO DIVEST FROM TURKEY REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH PAST DIVESTMENT FROM FOUR NATIONS INCLUDING SUDAN AND IRAN. IN THAT PERSON STIRS WILL NOT DIVEST UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ACTION FIRST. ALSO THIS BILL INCLUDES A PROVISION PROTECTING THE BOARDS OF CALPERS MCALISTER'S BY STATING ACTIONS TAKEN TO ALIGN WITH THIS BILL ARE NOT REQUIRED IF THEY VIOLATE THE BOARDS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES. FURTHER THERE'S A PROVISION INDEMNIFY IN THE BOARDS IN EMPLOYEES FROM CLAIMS BROUGHT FORTH BY ACTIONS TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS BILL. THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEYS AND WILLINGNESS TO RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE IN THEIR UNRELENTING CAMPAIGN TO DENY THE GENOCIDE CONTINUES TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ARMENIANS GREEKS AND ASSYRIANS WHO SUFFERED THE HANDS OF THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT. CALIFORNIA'S CLEAR POLICY ON THE GENOCIDE AS DEMONSTRATED BY DECADES OF LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTIONS AND GUBERNATORIAL PROCLAMATIONS. ALLOWING PENSION PLANS TO MAINTAIN HOLDINGS IN PUBLIC TRUST THAT ARE TURKISH GOVERNMENT BONDS INDIRECTLY SUBSIDIZES TURKISH DENIAL OF THE GENOCIDE THIS BILL CONTINUES CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO ACT APPROPRIATELY AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A RECORD OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND UNDERMINE A DEMOCRACY.

DESK AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NIVEAU. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I A I RISE IN SUPPORT OF. AB SIX HUNDRED I HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT AND THE CONCERNS REMAIN AND THAT IS THAT IN THE IN A VERY LARGE PART OF MY DISTRICT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COUNTY IN INCORPORATED AREAS THAT WERE NON NOT ANNEXED INTO THE CITY AND SO IT LEFT THEM AS DONUT HOLES. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF YOU'RE DRIVING THROUGH THE COMMUNITY AT NIGHT YOU WILL SEE STREET LIGHT CURBS AND GUTTERS AND THEN YOU COME TO THE END OF THE STREET AND THE REST OF THE STREET IS DARK IT HAS NONE IT HAS NO INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE NO CURBS GUTTERS SIDEWALKS AND STREET LIGHTS IT HASN'T SEPTIC TANKS AND IT HAS ITS IN THEIR OWN SEPARATE WELLS. AND THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS I JUST DON'T THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH THIS IS THE COMMUNITIES ENDED UP JUMPING OVER THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THEY'RE VERY POOR THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE INCUMBENT UPON THE STATE TO FORCE THESE ANNEXATIONS AND TO REQUIRE THEM THE COUNTY AND THE CITY ALONG WITH THE STATE TO PUT UP SOME MONEY. TO START FIXING THE INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THEM INCLUDED AND FRANKLY THERE ABANDONED THIS BILL DOES NOT DOES NOT HELP THEM BECAUSE THE PROPERTY ALL AROUND THEM HAS BEEN ANNEXED ALREADY AND SO I DON'T THINK THE BILL GOES FAR ENOUGH BUT I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT BECAUSE IN THE EVENT THAT THAT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT CAN BE ANNEXED IF THERE'S OTHER. PROPERTY NEARBY WE SHOULD DO IT BUT I THINK THE STATE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LEAD THE WAY AND BE THE LEADER IN THIS AND SAY WHAT WILL PUT UP SOME MONEY FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO. DO GREAT THANK YOU CENTER. THEIR PORCHES. FAMOUS PRESIDENT I HAVE A REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THIS FROM THE POSITION LOCAL CONTROL I THINK WHEN WE START DICTATING IN THERE ARE ALREADY LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT CERTAIN ON COUNTY ISLANDS FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY'RE UNDER CERTAIN NUMBER PARCELS OR A CERTAIN SIZE I SHOULD BE NATURALLY ABSORBED BY THE LARGER ENTITY NEARBY BUT THE PURPOSE OF LASKO IS TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF A GIVEN ENVIRONMENT AND FOR US TO IMPOSE UPON A LOCALITY THAT A GIVEN COMMUNITY OR GIVEN REGION BE ABSORBED. IT WHAT'S THE POINT OF LASKO IF WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE IN POSITIONS LIKE THIS I THINK IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF LOCAL CONTROL AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL CARVE THIS OUT AS BEING WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF. LOCAL ANNEXATION ENTITIES. THANK YOU CENTER BARGES. SENATOR DIED YES MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THE YING AND THE YANG AND I THINK THAT SENATOR HAS STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE THIS IS A GOOD BILL THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE'VE SEEN IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN WERE THESE COMMUNITIES GET OVERLOOKED I THINK THAT IS A GOOD BILL ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. SEE NO OTHER MIKE'S UP. THE BAY DISCUSSIONS OVER SO YOU CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH YEAH I THINK THAT THE GOOD SENATOR FROM NAPA HIT THE COURT YOU HAVE BOTH SIDES DISCUSSED IN THIS BILL AND VERY GRATEFUL THIS REALLY ADDRESSES THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SALINAS IS CONCERNED SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE'S A LOOPHOLE IN STATE LAW THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE ARE SEEN DOUGHNUTS IF YOU WILL WITHIN INCORPORATED COMMUNITIES. THEY'RE NOT BEING ANNEX. THIS WILL HELP CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO BE ABLE TO ANNEX AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS KNOW. CAL LASKO THE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION HAS DROPPED THEIR OPPOSITION FROM THIS BILL I APPRECIATE ASSUME EVER CHOOSE WORK ON THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ITEM.

AB FOR ELEVEN ALLOWS THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ TO USE THE BOND PROCEEDS FROM ITS FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN ORDER TO BUILD MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESS FACILITIES THIS WILL FREE UP APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BE USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO NAVIGATE THE DISSOLUTION PROCESS THROUGH THE APPROVAL OF THE LAST AND FINAL RECOGNIZED OBLIGATION PAYMENT SCHEDULE. VERY FEW FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE IN A SIMILAR POSITION AS IS THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ IN THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE DISSOLUTION PROCESS HAVE NO LITIGATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LEVERAGED ARE TWENTY ELEVEN HOUSING BONDS. ARE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE DISSOLVED IN TWENTY TWELVE THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZIS CURRENTLY FACING A HOUSING CRISIS AND ACCESS TO THESE ONE TIME FUNDS WILL HELP THE CITY TO ME IT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS MEMBERS THIS RECEIVED NO NO VOTES ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT IN AND COLLEAGUES. IT WAS CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDABLE DURING OUR BUDGET CRISIS WHEN. OUR FORMER GOVERNOR CHOSE TO GRAB REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE CITY TO MACULA FOR TWELVE YEARS AND TEN YEARS ON A BOARD SUPERVISOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THOSE TWO ENTITIES ACTUALLY USE REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS INCLUDING. THE 20% SET ASIDE FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. TO ME THIS AGAIN IS PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. YES MAYBE THE CITY IS IN A POSITION WHERE. THEY CAN CASH IN ON SOME OF THE TRUE INTENTIONS OF REDEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE LOW TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSING THAT'S A STRUGGLE THAT ALL OF OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT ABOUT THE ONES THAT FOLLOW THE RULES AND LIQUIDATED EARLIER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WHEN IN FACT THEY HAD WONDERFUL PLANS LIKE THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE IN THE CITY OF TEMECULA DID TO FURTHER PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT'S FAIR FOR ONE SHOULD BE FAIR FOR ALL WITH THE STATE THAT HAS A GOAL OF PROVIDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHY ARE WE GIVING SPECIAL. SPECIAL TREATS. TO ONE PARTICULAR ENTITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. MAYBE THE LADY AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY OR FOR WHATEVER REASON STILL HAS FUNDS THEY CAN USE FOR LOT LOW TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSING I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. BUT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS A WE FORCE OTHER AGENCIES OTHER MUNICIPALITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO LIQUIDATE THOSE FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE LOW TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSING IT'S AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS. IF WE'RE GONNA GRANT SOME CONCESSIONS TO ONE ENTITY WE SHOULD BE GRANTED CONCESSIONS TO ALL ENTITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF INCENTIVE. SOME SET ASIDE A PROPERTY TAXES TO ALLOW. MUNICIPALITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO FULFILL THE REINA. REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SHUT DOWN THEIR THROATS. TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE SHOULD BE DOING AT MY FRIENDS WITH. WITH A. A LIGHT BRUSH RATHER THAN A HARD STICK. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE'RE NOT CONSISTENT WE SHOULD BE EXPANDED THESE BENEFITS TO ALL CITIES ALL COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE SHOULD NOT BE GETTING A SPECIAL CONSIDERATION TO ONE FOR THOSE REASONS I REQUEST A NO VOTE ON EIGHTY FOUR ELEVEN. THIS PLACE TO TRY TO HOLD IT DOWN IN THE CHAMBER AT CENTRE BELL WAS HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING SO. YOU WANTED TO GIVE HIS PRESENTATION AGAIN. MOLLY KIDDING ON THAT BUT LET'S LET'S LET'S SHOW RESPECT TO OUR FELLOW MEMBERS IN AND HOLD IT DOWN. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

YEAH HE'S PREPARED MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN THIRTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ AN ACT RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION THERE HUESO THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF A SOME AND MEMBER GONZALEZ TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND THE DEADLINE FOR THE SENATE ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS TO FINALIZE A NEW REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN. BY TWO YEARS THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED NO NO VOTES AND HAS A BROAD LOCAL SUPPORT AND NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK ON AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE PART OF HIS BILL IS NEEDED THE TWO YEAR EXTENSION FOR SANDBAGS TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN FOR SENATOR REGION AND THE WHOLE SAN DIEGO REGION. HOWEVER THERE'S A LITTLE SECRET IN THIS BILL THAT SANDBAG REPRESENTATIVES ARE GLOSSING OVER AND SOME MADE MIGHT EVEN SAY TRYING TO HIDE. IT IS A CLAUSE THAT LIMITS FUNDS FROM GAS TAX TO PROJECTS INVOLVING BIKES IN BUSES. WHAT THAT MEANS IS NONE OF THE GAS TAX MONEY THAT THE VOTERS SUPPORTED COULD BE EVER USE FOR ROADS HIGHWAYS AND THAT'S INVOLVES TRANSIT. WHICH IS CODE FOR BIKES AND BUSES. THE SENDER REPRESENT IS UP HERE ARE PLAYING GAMES TRYING TO DENY THIS BUT IT'S ALL SPELLED OUT. IN THE DEMOCRAT FOR ANALYSIS AND THE REPUBLICAN FOR ANALYSIS AND I'LL QUOTE FROM ANALYSIS AND THAT'S ON OUR DESKS. QUOTE THE REQUIREMENT TO NARROW SENDAK ELIGIBILITY TO PROJECTS THAT ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIFIED TRANSIT. AND BICYCLE PEDESTRIAN PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVELY PREVENTS SAN DAG FROM USING THESE FUNDS FOR HIGHWAY PROJECTS SUCH AS ADDING LANES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE. IN QUOTE. BACKORDERS DIRECTLY OUT OF OUR FLOOR ANALYSIS AS I STATED SANDBAGS CURRENT MANAGEMENT SEEMS TO BE ANTI MOTORISTS. AND THIS IS A WAY OF GETTING SACRAMENTO TO DO SOME OF THEIR DIRTY WORK. IF WE PASS THIS IT WILL ROUTE REPRESENT ANOTHER IN A LONG LINE OF BROKEN PROMISES THE VOTERS IN MY DISTRICT AND OTHERS DISTRICTS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. DOWNTOWN TRANSPORTATION LEADS AND THE MAJORITY IS UP HERE IN THE CAPITAL. IT IS A BAIT AND SWITCH. YOU PROMISE EASE COUNTY IN NORTH COUNTY THE UPGRADES TO THE ROADS AND HIGHWAYS IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR SUPPORT. AND THEIR VOTES FOR THE GAS TAX HIKE. PRODUCES SPENDING PLAN THAT EXCLUDES SOME OF THE BUSIEST PARTS OF THE COUNTY. I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR A REVIEW OF THE MANAGEMENT AT ST DAG AND I WOULD ASK ALL OF US TO VOTE NO ON THIS. ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR JOHN CENTER BELL. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THE BILL THE BILL I THINK I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TALK ABOUT. THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT MY COLLEAGUES REYES I THINK WE HAVE TO ALL UNDERSTAND ONE THING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION FUNDING AND THAT'S YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN ADOPTED AND CONCURRED WITH BY THE COMMUNITY AND THE SANDBAG BOARD BEFORE YOU CAN GET OUR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING SO. ALTHOUGH THIS DELAYS ALLOWS HIM TO HAVE TWO MORE YEARS AFTER THAT TWO YEARS COMPLETED THEN UNDER THE LAW THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR ALL THE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND I DON'T THINK IT'LL RESULT IN REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT SAN DIEGO SAID ACTUALLY WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. IF THEY CAN GET A CONSENSUS ON THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN SO WITHOUT I WOULD URGE IN. OUR AYE VOTE ON THIS UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS. THANK YOU SENATOR BELL ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION THING NINE CENTER HUESO YOU MAY CLOSE YEAH THANK YOU AND I JUST WANTED TO THANK US IN A BILL FOR CLEAR FIND THAT THAT IS. NOT A CONDITION THAT WAS PUT ON THIS BILL BUT SAN DIEGO IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SENDAK. IS PUSHING FOR THIS BILL HAS GONE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND WE KNOW HOW THAT IS IF THIS BILL IS NOT PERFECT AND THAT. OF THE EGGS THAT. POLICY ADDED TO THE BILL WAS SIMPLY TO ENCOURAGE SENDAK TO COMPLY. AND ONCE THEY DO THE FUNDING WILL WOULD COME THROUGH. AND THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION. AMENDMENT. THAT WAS ADDED TO THE BILL AND OF COURSE THE. THE AUTHOR DIDN'T WANTED I DIDN'T WANT TO SEND AGAIN WANTED BUT- IF WE ARE. GOING TO HELP. SENDAK COMPLY WITH THE. THE POSITION THE RENT CURRENTLY THEY'RE THEY'RE% BETWEEN HOT ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. AND THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO WORK WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY FINALIZE OUR PLANETS THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO AND THEY DIDN'T COMPLY AND THEY WERE WENT TO COURT AND THEY LOST AND NOW THEY'RE THEY'D THEY NEED AN EXTENSION ON THAT SO. HELPLESS WORK WITH OUR LOCAL AGENCY HELP THEM COMPLY WITH STATE LAW AND THAT MONEY WILL COME THROUGH EVENTUALLY ONCE THEY COME TO AND I HAVE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE TO SEND A COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND THAT ONCE AGAIN THE THOSE MONIES WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE PROJECTS AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS. TO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT VOTE BUT I REALLY ENCOURAGE. EVERYBODY SUPPORT THIS AYE AYE AYE. YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO ALSO ENCOURAGE HIM TO SUPPORT THIS IS SOMETHING. THE SENDEK NEEDS AND LOCAL LEADERS NEED I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY. THAT WORK IN WITH THE SITUATION BUT- ALL THIS WILL WORK FOR THE BETTER WE NEED THIS BILL TO PASS TODAY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR HUESO MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I ARCHULETA.

HIGHS THIRTY KNOWS EIGHT THE MEASURE PASSES. NOW I'M. NOW MEMBERS ARE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM ONE SEVENTIES TO SENATOR PANEL AND HE'S GOING TO PASS ON FILE MOVING ON NOW TO FILE ITEM ONE SEVENTY FOUR SENATOR HUESO ARE YOU PREPARED HE IS MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL A FIFTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC BANKS. THAT ARE HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER. PRESIDENT THIS IS A LOCAL A REALLY GOOD LOCAL CONTROL BILL FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT OUR- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HERE ON THIS FLOOR. AND IT'S ALSO A BILL THAT GIVES A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ADDITIONAL TOOLS. TO MEET SOME OTHER GOALS TO PROVIDE. OFTEN TIMES DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WILL HELP THEIR LOCAL ECONOMY. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A VERY VERY DIFFICULT THING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORK WITH THE BANKING INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE LOANS TO UNDERSERVED AREAS. ALTHOUGH I'VE I'VE WORKED IN THAT AREA IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT AREA TO WORK IN. SO THIS BILL AB FIFTY STATE FIFTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW. THE LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ESTABLISH CREATURES A PROFS PROCESS TO. ALLOW THEM TO CHARTER A PUBLIC BANK IN THEIR CITIES IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH PUBLIC BLANCA SIMPLY ESTABLISHES A PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO CHARTER A PUBLIC BLANK A LONG MULTI YEAR PROCESS. WITH MANY REGULATORY HURDLES HOWEVER IT IT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THIS THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA IT'S BEEN DONE IN NORTH DAKOTA IT'S BEEN DONE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS SUCCESSFULLY. AND THIS COULD WORK FOR OUR LOCAL CITIES LET THEM DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO WORK ON THIS I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC BILL. FOR ALL OF ALL OF YOU THAT SUPPORTER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO KEEP THEIR THEIR ATTACKS SOLIS WORKING FOR THE BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY THAN RATHER THAN. HAVING TO RELY ON ON ON BANKS SOMETIMES IN MANY CASES LIKE IN MY DISTRICT SOME SOME BANKS HAVE MOVED OUT AND LET MET MANY COMMUNITIES ON BANK. AND THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM I KNOW SOME BANKS HAVE STEPPED UP BUT OTHERS HAVEN'T OTHERS HAVE FLED. UNDERSERVED AREAS IN THIS WILL ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO LEASE PROVIDE THAT SERVICE WHERE BANKS ARE LEAVING THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY ADDITIONAL DEBATER DISCUSSION CENTER MORE OCT. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. COLLEAGUES GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE MISSION. THERE SHOULD NOT BE A STYLE DRIFT AND THERE SHOULD BE EXTREME EXTREME CAUTION WHEN A MUNICIPALITY ATTEMPTS TO PERFORM FUNCTIONS BEST DONE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I HAVE ENJOYED THE EXERCISE. OF CONSIDERING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BANK SHORTLY AFTER I BECAME THE TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR OF ORANGE COUNTY. IT TURNED OUT THAT. THE MAJOR BANKS WERE IN NO MOOD. THEY HAVE THE FIFTY THOUSAND WELFARE RECIPIENTS. COME INTO THE BRANCHES ON THE FIRST OF THE MONTH. AND I WAS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO CONVINCE. I ALMOST WANT TO SAY THEIR NAMES BUT I WON'T THAT SAID THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT. NEEDED TO BE DONE AND BECAUSE THEY HAD NO LEVERAGE I CONTACTED A LAWYER IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY WE. CONTACTED THE FBI SEE AND THEY SAID THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT- WILL GIVE THE GREEN LIGHT. WROTE THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THOUGHT ON IN YOUR RESERVATION GAVE ME THE GREEN LIGHT. I MET WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF BANKS IN DOWNTOWN LA. AND I SAID I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY WELFARE RECIPIENTS AND I WANT TO START A BANK. AND I THOUGHT. THEY WOULD KICK ME OUT WITHIN FIVE MINUTES BUT THEY START ASKING QUESTIONS CAN YOU DO AUTOMATIC DEPOSITS TO PAY RENT CAN YOU DO POINT TO SELL CARDS CAN YOU DO THEY WERE LIKE WE JUST HAD A GREAT A GREAT TIME. AND THEY SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE SO WE'RE SO FRUSTRATED THAT SO MANY OF OUR WELFARE RECIPIENTS ARE GOING TO CHECK CASHING SERVICES AND PAYING A HEFTY PREMIUM TO GET THERE FUNDING AND IF YOU CAN MAINSTREAM THEM WITH MAKING PAYMENTS TO THEIR UTILITIES AND TO THEIR TO THEIR LANDLORDS THAT WOULD BE REAL HELPFUL I. I HAD A GREAT TIME WITH THE STATE BANKING REPRESENTATIVES AND THEY SAID PLEASE COME BACK WITH A BUSINESS PLAN. SO I DID. I TRIED TO THE BUSINESS PLAN WENT THROUGH THE MECHANICS REALIZE I WAS GOING TO SAVE A MILLION DOLLARS IF I STARTED A BANK FOR THE COUNTY TO HANDLE THIS. POPULATION END UP. I EVEN PASSED THE CEOS OF ALL THE SMALL BANKS IN ORANGE COUNTY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS IDEA SHOULD WE PURSUE IT. AND THEY CAME BACK AND SAID NOT ONLY DO WE LIKE THE IDEA WOULD LIKE TO BE ON YOUR BOARD. SO THEN I DID SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING I WENT TO SOCIAL SERVICES. AND I SAID I AM GOING TO CHARGE YOU YOUR DEPARTMENT FOR YOUR SPECIFIC COSTS FOR ISSUING WELFARE CHECKS I HAD ONE. BANK LOCATION WHERE IT WAS IN A GROCERY STORE. AND ON THE FIRST OF THE MONTH THE SHOPPERS OF THAT STORE COULD NOT GET INTO THE STORE BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A LONG LINE OF. PEOPLE TRYING TO CATCH THEIR WELFARE CHECK TODAY THEY HAD TO PUT A VAN IN THE PARKING LOT. AND THEY CHARGED ME FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH.JUST FOR THAT ONE DAY THE CASH CHECKS FOR THE COUNTY. SO. WAS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM A YEAR THAT WILL THAT SOCIAL SERVICES WAS COSTING MY DEPARTMENT SO I TOLD THEIR BUDGET ANALYST YOU'RE GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLEFOR. HE WAS PRETTY UPSET. BUT HE CAME BACK ABOUT A WEEK LATER AND SAID YOU KNOW IF YOU GIVE ME A SPECIFIC BILL FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS I CAN TURN THAT OVER TO THE FEDERAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEY WILL REIMBURSE ME 80% OF MY COST AND I THOUGHT MY GOODNESS. OBVIOUSLY THE COUNTY WAS LITTLE FLOPPY AND DIDN'T CHECK INTO THIS BEFORE BUT IF I'M GOING TO SAVE A MILLION DOLLARS IS STARTING A BANK I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SAVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SO AFTER ALL THAT WORK. I SAID I REALLY DON'T TO DO THAT. BUT IT WAS A FUN EXERCISE AND I WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF EVERYONE ALONG THE WAY BUT I WILL TELL YOU FROM THAT EXERCISE. THAT THE PROFIT MARGIN IS THE MINIMUS I MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT IF YOU START A BANK IS A MUNICIPALITY THAT YOU HAVE. MORE DOWNSIDE THEN YOU HAVE UP SIDE. AND YOUR DRIFTING FROM WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. WE DON'T DESIGN GOVERNMENTS TO RUN BANKS. AND SO GIVING PERMISSION FOR THIS ONLY EXPOSES THOSE THAT HAVE GONE OR WISH TO GO INTO THIS AREA TO MORE DOWNSIDE AND RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT THEIR FINANCIAL SATEMENTS THE OUR CITIES AND OUR MUNICIPALITIES DO NOT NEED MORE. DOWNSIDE BECAUSE THEY ARE READY FISCALLY DISTRESSED WITH EVER INCREASING PENSION COSTS AND THE REST SO I'M I'M UST TELLING YOU AS SOMEONE WHO HAS GONE DOWN THIS ROAD. THAT IT ISN'T A PRUDENT WAY TO GO IT WON'T BE BENEFICIAL. AND WE DON'T HAVE A DIRT THE BANKS LEAVING COMMUNITIES WE HAVE. SO MANY CHASIN. BANK OUTLETS IN SHOPPING CENTERS AND BUILDINGS POPPING UP EVERY WE DO NOT HAVE A BANK SHORTAGE SO WITH THAT I ALSO WOULD SAY THAT NORTH DAKOTA IS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE IT'S LIKE COMPARING APPLES VERSUS ORANGES SO COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON A. B. EIGHT. FIFTY SEVEN. THANK YOU SIR MORE LOCK CENTER BELL. JUST BASICALLY. I THINK THE OF THE CLAUSE IN THE BILL THAT REQUIRES A ANALYSIS. AND THAT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF. THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN IF ANYBODY EVER WANTS TO CONSIDER A PUBLIC BANK SO THERE IS A SECTION IN THE BILL THAT DEALS WITH THAT ISSUE CORD REQUIRES THAT KIND OF STUDY. IT'S PRUDENT TO DO THAT KIND OF STUDY AND A LOT OF A LOT OF STUDY BEFORE THESE KINDS OF THINGS OR ESTABLISH HOWEVER I THINK THERE IS A NEED TO HAVE IS MANY TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX. OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND FINANCING AGENCIES THAT FINANCE INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING OTHER KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AND HAVING SUCH A- THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE WHETHER IT'S LIMÃ³N EARNED OR OR QUITE. OPEN COULD BE AN A TOOL THAT WOULD BE IS OF BENEFIT TO OUR COMMUNITY SO HARD SUPPORT FOR THIS. IT DOESN'T SAY PUBLIC BANKS CREDIT SENSORS A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH TO CREATE A PUMP. THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES ARJAN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU AND MISTER PRESIDENT NUMBERS I THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I'VE HEARD A LOT FROM MY DISTRICT ABOUT THERE'S A LOT OF APPEAL TO THE IDEA OF A PUBLIC BANK BECAUSE OF ARGUMENTS THAT THE FLOOR MANAGER HAS REYES AND CERTAINLY THE SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE IS REYES THAT WE HAVE SOME ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES WERE PUBLIC BANKING OR FINANCIAL HELP COULD BE A BENEFIT AND THAT'S HOUSING THAT'S INFRASTRUCTURE. CERTAINLY FOR THOSE OF US FOR FOLLOWING THE WHOLE BITING CANNON THIS COMING INDUSTRY WE KNOW THAT AND THAT THE REQUIREMENTS THE PROHIBITION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWING BANKING IN CANNABIS IS CREATING ENORMOUS PROBLEMS THE TO THE STATE TREASURER THE PAST SAYS TREASURER JUDGE JOHN. TRAVEL AROUND THE STATE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY COULD TO DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE NAY IT DIDN'T SETTLE ON THIS IS AS A VIABLE SOLUTION BUT IT IT HAS A LOT IT HAS A LOT OF APPEAL THE LA TIMES THAT HAD A VERY GOOD EDITORIAL ON THE SUBJECT ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT. IN THIS CASE ENCOURAGING OF DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M GONNA CAST TODAY WHICH IS THE COURAGE TO KNOW VOTE ON THE ISSUE BUT THEY RAISE A VERY GOOD ISSUES ABOUT THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENT TO MAKE CHOICES THAT COULD HAVE THE TINGE OF POLITICS INVOLVED IN THOSE CHOICES AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S THE RIGHT FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY. FOR A PUBLIC ENTITY. I THINK THAT THE PART OF THIS MEASURE THAT I GUESS. TELLS ME TO THE SIDE OF SAYING IT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD VOTE FOR TODAY'S BECAUSE IT ONLY AUTHORIZES. A PROCESS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN GO THROUGH. AND SURVIVE. FEELINGS TO THE TO THOSE WHO WOULD CONSIDER IT LOCALLY IS TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL. I HOPE THAT WERE NOT CREATING A BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS AUTHORIZATION. BUT GIVEN ITS LIMITED SCOPE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE STATE IS DOING. SOMETHING THAT I CAN SUPPORT TODAY AND ENCOURAGING EITHER. THANK YOU SIR GLAZER NAY DID CATCHER POND. SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS BRIEFLY I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS IN MY DISTRICT TO THE COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ THE CITY OF WATSONVILLE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN EXPLORING PARTNERSHIPS MORE BROADLY REGIONALLY WITH SANTA CLARA COUNTY SAN BENITO COUNTY MONTEREY COUNTY. AS A MEANS OF POTENTIALLY KEEPING INVESTOR MONEY COMMUNITY MONEY IN THE COMMUNITY WORKING FOR THE COMMUNITY THIS BILL SUPPORTS. LOOKING AT HOW THE MECHANICS OF COMMUNITY BASED BANK MIGHT MOVE FORWARD I URGE AN EYEFUL. THANK YOU SIR SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR HUESO YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MUST PRESENT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THIS GREAT DEBATES IN OF COURSE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE VERY. LUCKY TO HAVE A BIG BROTHER LIKE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM COSTA MESA THAT WILL IS THERE TO PROTECT THEM FROM THEMSELVES. BUT THE TRUTH IS. YOU KNOW I WANT TO AGREE WITH A LOT OF HIS COMMENTS AND ONCE A ONE AGREE WITH WAS. THE YOU CAN'T COMPARE THE. NOTE THE QUARTERBACK TO OTHER BANKS WHEN THE LEADERS OF NORTH DAKOTA WE'RE ASKING YOU KNOW IT'S A REPUBLICAN STATEMENTS RUN BY A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY WERE ASKED DO YOU SUPPORT PUBLIC BANKING THEIR RESPONSES. WE LOVE OUR PUBLIC BANK BUT WE DON'T RECOMMEND ANYBODY ELSE TO IT. AND THAT'S THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN AND UNFORTUNATELY IT IT'S BECOME OF. A NEW ISSUE. THAT IT SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT PARTISAN WHEN IT REALLY ISN'T. THE NORTH DAKOTA BANK WAS ACTUALLY STARTED BY FARMERS. TO GET GET THEM ACCESS TO CAPITAL. WHERE THE REGULAR BANKING COMMUNITY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT WE HAVE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO BANKING WAR OR FINANCING. SO IT WORKS IN ACTUALLY IN NORTH DAKOTA. THEY THEY HAVE HELPED MAKE BANKING MORE COMPETITIVE IN THEIR STATE SO THEY HAVE MORE BANKING COVERAGE THAN ANY OTHER STATE THAT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR PUBLIC BANK BECAUSE OF THE BACK AND ACTUALLY BRINGS A LOT OF CAPITAL A LOT OF REVENUE TO THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT. SO YES IT IS NOT A FAIR COMPARISON BECAUSE THE PUBLIC BACK IN NORTH DAKOTA IS HELPING PUT MONEY FOR PUBLIC SERVICES IN NORTH DAKOTA TOPPING TO ENHANCE BANKING IN COMMUNITIES SO IT'S BEEN A GREAT PRODUCT FOR NORTH DAKOTA AND I DON'T SEE WHY IT WON'T WORK FOR CALIFORNIA SO. I WANT TO ADD THAT AND THE OTHER THING IS. YOU KNOW IF GOVERNMENT SHOULD FOCUS ON THIS MISSION. WHERE WHERE WAS A SCREAMING AND YELLING ON THAT ISSUE WHEN THE BUSH WHEN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. DID A MASSIVE BAILOUT OF BANKS. HERE WITH WITH THE WITH THE BANK FAILURES HERE WERE TAXPAYER FUNDS BEING USED TO BAIL OUT. BANKS THAT WERE NOT MANAGED PROPERLY. SO YES BANKING CAN BE OF. COMPLICATED BUSINESS AND. AND IT CAN CREATE PROBLEMS BUT GUESS WHAT BANK WASN'T BAILED OUT BY THE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT THE NORTH DAKOTA THANK. SO THERE ARE VERY STRONG ARGUMENTS THERE IS HIS ALL. JUST A MATTER OF LET THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DECIDE WHETHER THIS WORKS FOR THEM IT MIGHT WE THIS BILL MAY NEVER CREATE A PUBLIC BANK IN CALIFORNIA BUT WHY NOT GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND I TELL YOU. THAT THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA BRINGS MORE REINVESTMENT CAPITAL TO THAT STATE. BECAUSE IT EXISTS AND WE CAN DO THAT THE CALIFORNIA WHY NOT BRING IN.

PRICE TWENTY FIVE KNOWS ELEVEN THE MEASURE KERRY'S RIGHT NOW MEMBERS REMOVED BACK TO FILE ITEM ONE SEVENTY THREE CENTER BRADFORD ARE YOU PREPARED HE IS MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE FIFTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING AN ACT RELATING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AFTER THE FLOOR SHORES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AB TWELVE FIFTEEN IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SOBEL'S LIBERTIES MEASURE THAT WOULD PROHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING FACIAL RECOGNITION AND BIOMETRIC SCANNERS. EMBODY CAMBER'S AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE IMPLEMENTED BODY CAMERA PROGRAMS TO HELP INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND MEN TRUSTS WITH THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE SWORN TO PROTECT AND SERVE. HOWEVER COMBINING FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE WOULD BODY CAMERAS CAN LEAD TO A DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR CALIFORNIANS. MAKING COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE WHILE SUBJECTING LAW ABIDING RESIDENTS TO PERPETUAL POLICE LINEUPS WITHOUT. THEIR CONSENT THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IS OFTEN INACCURATE ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ACCORDING TO THE MIT STUDIES LAST YEAR STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING THIS TECHNOLOGY AND FALSELY MAX TWENTY EIGHT. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN PHOTO MODE MUGSHOT DATABASE THE SAME TESTS WAS EVEN WORSE HERE IN SACRAMENTO FALSELY IDENTIFYING TWENTY SIX STATE LEGISLATORS INCLUDING MYSELF AND ASSEMBLYMAN. TING AS WELL AS SENATORS. ARCHULETA BAIL DOLLY GALGIANI GLAZER HE'LL. HUESO JONES MORALE AND WIENER. IN BOTH CHECKS AND BOTH TESTS MEMBERS OF COLOR WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY MISIDENTIFIED AB TWELVE FIFTEEN PREVENTS THE MAGIC MISUSE OF ON RELIABLE TECHNOLOGY WHICH YOU MAKE MORE ABOUT COMMUNITIES EVEN MORE DISTRUSTFUL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND FOLLOWING THE MAN'S IN THIS HOUSE THE BILL IS NOW IMPOSES A THREE YEAR MORATORIUM ON THE FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN BODY CAMERAS LET'S BE CLEAR IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE REINFORCE THAT THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO BODY CAMERAS. WERE FACIAL RECOGNITION ERRORS IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AT NINE AND OTHER DEVICES OR SETTINGS ULTIMATELY INTRUDING INDIVIDUALS OUR PRIVACY BEEN SUBJECTING COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO BIASED AND INACCURATE SURVEILLANCE'S WILL NOT BE PUBLIC TRUST NOR MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. UNFORTUNATELY HIGH RISE TO OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON AND I APPRECIATE WITH THE AUTHOR TRYING TO DO WITH THE MEASURE BUT I AM OPPOSED TO NOT RIDE BAN ON THE NEW TECHNOLOGY I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE RESEARCH SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP TO STANDARDS AND IT WILL BE FAIR AND EQUITABLE IF SOMEONE CAN LOOK IN THE CAMERA AND THERE IS NO DEVIATION FROM THE SCREEN. SO I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP WORKING ON THE TECHNOLOGY IT SAID ABOUT BLOWING THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE I THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE GETTING OUR CITY PARAMETERS AROUND THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE IS THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE ALL KNOW IT'S UNFAIR NOT EQUITABLE AS WILL AS I TOO AM A VICTIM OF THE CAMERA. BUT THIS DOESN'T DO THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE LEADER OF A TECHNICAL SECTOR AND AS THE LEADER WE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTING THE BEST PRACTICES OF TECHNOLOGY HERE IN CALIFORNIA RATHER THAN OTHER STATES SO FOR THIS REASON I THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IS FLAWED AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN IMPROVE IT ON THE NEXT ONE. IS OVER THIS I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SIR CENTER HERTZBERG. BRIEFLY MISTER PRESIDENT I AGREE WITH. THE SENATOR FROM PICO RIVERA THAT THERE'S A CHALLENGE HERE BUT WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES. IS VAN THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR THREE YEARS NOW I KNOW IN TECHNOLOGY THREE YEARS IS A LIFETIME BUT ORIGINALLY WRITTEN I THINK IT WAS TEN YEARS OR SEVEN YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE BALANCE OF CIVIL LIBERTIES THE BALANCE OF THE NEED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE LIKE AGAINST WHAT IS PROVEN TO BE SECTION EIGHT EIGHT ABSOLUTELY L SOURCE OF INFORMATION THE IMPACT ON INDIVIDUAL LIVES THE AVAILABILITY OF THE EXTRAORDINARY RESOURCES. A FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TODAY THAT HAVE NEVER EXISTED BEFORE THE QUESTION IS. GIVEN THAT BALANCE IS IT THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO GET THE TECHNOLOGY CORRECT WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS IN BIAS IN OTHER AREAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE THERE'S THIS GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY THAT BOTH HAS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP GOVERNMENT IN MANY WAYS. BUT YET ISN'T QUITE THERE YET IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OUR THREE YEAR AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN BY THE AUTHOR ARE VERY GENEROUS AND A THREE YEAR DELAY IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BALANCE IS THE NECESSARY NEEDS AGAINST NECESSARY RISK IT AS SUCH I'LL BE VOTING FOR THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SIR. ANY ADDITIONAL DEBATER DISCUSSION CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO REINFORCE THE COMMENTS BY MY. CALLING FROM THE VALLEY AND- THE- I THINK THE DANGER OF. OF ARE NOT TAKING THE ACTION THAT'S BEFORE US. IS THAT A TECHNOLOGY THAT IS STILL FLAWED. COULD THEN BE USED IN A WAY THAT COULD BE VERY HARMFUL AND I THINK NONE OF US WANT THAT. WE DO WANT OUR. LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS ABSOLUTELY AND WE ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO. PURSUE THE FOLKS THAT WE FEEL ARE THE POTENTIAL PERPETRATORS OF A CRIME. AND HAVE THE SECURITY THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN APPREHEND THEM. BUT THE TECHNOLOGY IN ITS CURRENT FORM. IS AS WAS EIGHTY EIGHT EVERY BIT OF DATA THAT YET TESTED IT SHOWS. IS IN A LOT OF MISTAKES IN VERY VERY SADLY THOSE MISTAKES I DON'T WANT TO SEE SADLY BUT I SUPPOSE TYPICALLY THOSE MISTAKES ARE MOSTLY. IT ACCURATELY CAPTURING THE FACES OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE KNOW MY FACE SO WHEN THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE THAT SHOWED WHICH OF THE LEGISLATORS IT INACCURATELY DEPICTED AS A POTENTIAL CRIMINAL. I WAS IN ON IT. BUT THE AUTHOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM WAS LISTED. I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ONE WHITE LEGISLATOR ON THE LIST THAT THE TEST SHOWED. THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OKAY SORRY ALL RIGHT I GUESS WE HAVE A FEW CRIMINALS SORRY SORRY. ALL RIGHT WELL. BUT THE POINT BEING THE POINT BEING THEY TESTED. ALL OF OUR FACES SO. IT IS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE VALLEY POINTED OUT. IT'S ONLY THREE YEARS. AND TECHNOLOGY CAN GREATLY IMPROVE. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT. ACTION TO TAKE TODAY. THANK YOU SIR SKINNER SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AS ONE OF THOSE LEGISLATORS THAT DID SHOW UP ON THE LIST I DO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE FIFTEEN ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS SOME DEBATE AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF US DISCUSS THE DEBATE REGARDING THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY ON THE 80% VERSUS THE 99% IF THEY HAD YOU KNOW. CHANGE ALGORITHM OR WHATEVER BUT YOU KNOW WHAT BEAT REGARDLESS OF ALL OF THAT I'M NOT SURE I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY BEING USED MAYBE EVER SO I KNOW THAT THE ADVOCATES OF THE BILL HAVE WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY THIS YEAR TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE I KNOW THE AUTHOR AND THE FLOOR JOCKEY HAVE WORKED VERY DILIGENT DILIGENTLY ON IT AS WELL I THINK THE THREE YEAR SUNSET IS MORE THAN REASONABLE AND JUST TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE. COLLEAGUES WERE ON THE LAST. THREE DAYS. OF OUR FIRST YEAR. AND THIS LEGISLATURE. TIME FLIES. SO THREE YEARS IS GONNA GO BY REALLY FAST AND I HAD ASKED THAT WE ALL SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR CENTER GALGIANI. I RISE IS ONE OF THE LEGISLATORS WITH THE TWIN OUT THERE I HAVE TWO POINTS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE ONE IS THAT WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY I WAS ASKED TO VOTE ON A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR SELF DRIVING VEHICLES WE HAD NEVER HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT SUBJECT MATTER IT WAS THE FURTHEST THING FROM MY MIND AND I REALLY DIDN'T FEEL THAT I KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY TO CAST A VOTE. BUT WE ALL DID CAST VOTES. I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY REALIZE HOW QUICKLY THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD ADAPT AND HOW SOON. THERE WOULD BE ELECTRIC SELF DRIVING CARS OUT THERE BEING TESTED ON THE ROAD WE COULDN'T WE COULDN'T PREDICT WHAT THE ADVANCEMENTS IN THAT TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE. SECONDLY I REPRESENT STANISLAUS COUNTY AND EARLIER. THIS MONTH WE HAD A STRAIGHT PRIDE PARADE AND MODESTO. AND WHILE WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THERE WERE THAT THERE WERE NO NOT ANY VIOLENT. ISSUES ARE INCIDENTS. I WOULD WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A PUBLIC EVENT LIKE THAT WHERE. INDIVIDUALS WERE UNDER THREAT AND TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE WHO THEY SHOULD WATCH MORE CAREFULLY AND CAUTIOUSLY. TO AVOID AN ASSAULT SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER MITCHELL. I STAND UP IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL FOR ONCE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T SHOW UP ON A LIST FOR ONCE WHEN IT COMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SO. GOAL HOLLY I. I THINK A THREE YEAR PAUSE. IS APPROPRIATE WE ARE DEALING WITH LOTS OF CONCERNS AROUND BIAS IMPLICIT EXPLICIT OTHERWISE. AND SO AS WE ARE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS TALKING ABOUT TRAINING. ELEVATING THOSE ISSUES WITH REGARD TO YOU KNOW. POLICE STOPS ARRESTS I HAVE BEEN IN. IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AT A DISPROPORTIONATE RATE COMPARED TO ANOTHER I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE HAVE A PAUSE TO ALLOW TECHNOLOGY TO CATCH UP. AND TO ALLOW OUR OVER ALL THINKING AND ATTITUDES ABOUT COMMUNITY INTERACTION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CATCH UP AS WELL. JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF EQUITY ACROSS THE BOARD. IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTIONS WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC THE LOBBY SUPPORTING ON MR KING'S BAIL ON. ANTI GAY THREE YEAR PAUSES MORE THAN REASONABLE. THANK YOU SENATOR. CENTER GLAZER WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS LIKE IF THE ISSUE BEFORE US WAS ABOUT THE USE AND ABUSE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT'S A HEALTHY DEBATE BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO BE TRAMPLED ON. NOBODY WANTS THAT. BUT THE ISSUE HERE IS WHETHER WE ARTIFICIALLY STATE GOVERNMENT ARTIFICIALLY PUTS A STOP. TO THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT TECHNOLOGY. THE HELP IS CATCHING THE BAD PEOPLE. SO WHY WOULD WE PUT OUR HEAD IN THE SAND AND SAY WE'RE GONNA STOP IT ARTIFICIALLY BECAUSE OF OUT OF WORRY. THAT THAT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY GETS THE USER REVIEWS. THAT'S WHAT THE QUESTION THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE BEFORE US. WE WANT PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO BE PROTECTED. WE DON'T WANT TO ARREST TO BE MADE FOR THE WRONG REASONS OR PROSECUTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE WRONG REASONS. THROUGH ABUSE OF ANYTHING CIVIL RIGHTS DUE PROCESS. OR THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK THIS BILL IS. PREMATURE AND ADDRESSES THE WRONG STANDARDS THAT WE SHOULD DEBATE THE DEBATE ON THIS FLOOR. AND ACCORDINGLY I'M RECOMMENDING IN NOVA. THANK YOU SIR GLAZER CENTER DIED. I APPRECIATE THAT RED YOU KNOW THOSE REMARKS FIRM. IT WAS THE GETS THE GOOD CENTER FROM LIVERMORE. AREA BUT YOU KNOW I WAS AGAINST THIS BILL WHEN IT FIRST CAME TO THIS HOUSE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS AN OVER REACH YEAH I TO WHAT YOUR SAFETY IN MY COMMUNITY. BUT WHEN HE CAME OVER HERE I THINK IT LOOKED YEAH PRETTY TOUGH AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FROM SAMPSON SAID GOOD SEMI MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR COMPROMISING A AND BRING IN THIS FROM SEVEN YEARS TO THREE YEARS AND IT HAS THE CENTER FROM SAN DIEGO SAID THREE YEARS IS NOT A LONG TIME WHEN IT COMES TO LEGISLATIVE TIME FOR SURE AND I CERTAINLY DO NOT THINK THAT THIS WILL. STIFLE THAT INNOVATION PEOPLE STILL BE ABLE TO WORK ON THESE TYPE OF THINGS TO REFINE THEM AND GET A BETTER TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY. SAFE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER DIED. NOT SEEING ANY OTHER MIKE SUB SENATOR BRADFORD YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK THOSE MEMBERS WHO HAVE ADDED THEIR VOICE TO THIS BUT IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT THREE YEARS AGO WHEN ASSEMBLY WOMAN WEBER INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO PASS OFFICERS TO WEAR BODY CAMERAS THE RESISTANCE FROM MANY MEMBERS HERE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OF WHY THEY WEREN'T NECESSARY NOW THREE YEARS LATER AFTER WE'VE INTRODUCED BODY CAMERAS NOW EVERY BY WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD AND ADDING ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGY THAT IS YET TO BE FULLY DEVELOPED. AND ALL THE KINKS WORKED OUT OF IT THIS IS NOT PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING FACIAL RECOGNITION AND OTHER DEVICES TO IDENTIFY BAD GUYS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BODY CAMERA WORK USE THE LAW OFFICERS MOVING AND THE SUB A SUBJECT IS MOVING YOU'RE NOT FOCUS SEEN TAKING A STILL SHOT OF SOMEONE SO UP PICTURES DIFFUSE THE LANDS IS NOT FOCUS SO IT'S GREAT ROOM FOR ACT INACCURACIES HERE BY USING A BODY CAMERA TO IDENTIFY ONE'S FACIAL FEATURES. AGAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN STILL USE THAT. TECHNOLOGY ON OTHER DEVICES AND OTHER. METHOD TO IDENTIFY FOLKS REDUCING NOT ON A BODY CAMERA AND AGAIN THE SAME BODY CAMERAS THAT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY ADVOCATED FOR THREE YEARS AGO AS A TOOL FOR. GREATER PUBLIC. TRUST AND GREATER OFFICER SAFETY SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND MANY OTHERS BUT AGAIN THE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT OF ALL WE HAVE ARE THÃ NH THOMAS CARS RIGHT NOW THAT WE'VE HEARD STORIES OF PEOPLE BEING KILLED. BY AYE THOMAS CAR SELECTED TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED AND IN THREE YEARS I THINK WE'LL ALL BE IN SUPPORT OF EXPANDING THE USE OF. BODY CAMERAS FOR FACE RECOGNITION I RESPECT LESS RIVAL.

AB TWELVE NINETEEN WOULD PROVIDE THE STATUTORY CHANGES NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT A NEW STREAMLINED AND TRANSPARENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING THE PROPER ASSIGNMENT OF TEACHERS IN OUR SCHOOLS RESEARCH OVER DECADES AS MADE ONE THING VERY CLEAR. THE PREPARATION OF THE CERTIFICATION OF OUR TEACHERS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF STUDENT SUCCESS THE PROPER ASSIGNMENT OF TEACHERS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS. MISS ASSIGN TEACHERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LEAVE THE PROFESSION CREATING AN UNSTABLE AND LESS EFFECTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS WHO NEED THE MOST SUPPORT. THE NEW MISS ASSIGNMENT MONITORING SYSTEM PROPOSED BY THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE ANNUAL MONITORING OF ASSIGNMENTS AT ALL SCHOOLS REPLACING THE CURRENT SYSTEM A MONITORING ONE QUARTER OF SCHOOLS PER YEAR.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL A TWENTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AN ACTUAL IN A BUSINESS THROUGH THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT YOU KNOW HOW. MEMBERS. AMONG THE ARRAY OF ISSUES THAT WE GRAPPLE WITH. IN THIS ON THIS FLOOR. HEALTHCARE DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HEALTHCARE COSTS DOMINATE NOT JUST THE HEALTH COMMITTEE HE'S WITH SO MANY OF THE OTHER ISSUES AND PROVIDING KIND OF THE CORE VALUES OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CARE OF THE FOLKS. THAT ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ONE COMPONENT OF THAT HEALTH CARE COSTS IS PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. YESTERDAY I WAS SAY IN THE RENTS TO TALK TO THEM I TODAY PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES ARE TOO HIGH 17% OF OVERALL HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE UNITED STATES YOU GUYS CENTER SKINNER. OUR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 17% BIG NUMBER. SO WHAT ASSEMBLY WHAT THE CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE IN THE OTHER HOUSE DOCTOR WOOD IS DOING HERE IS FOUND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'RE EXPENSIVE. ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT OFTEN THERE'S LASUITS PATENT LAWSUITS BETWEEN DRUG MANUFACTURERS ARE AMONG DRUG MANUFACTURERS HAS BEEN A HOST OF LITIGATION ON THIS. AND IN ORDER TO SETTLE THE CASE THEY ENGAGE IN WHAT'S CALLED HEY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS THINK ABOUT THIS. I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW BUCKS WILL DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION I GET TO MAKE A BUNCH MORE MONEY IN MY COMPANY YOU GET TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS AND WHO PAYS WE DO THE GOVERNMENT DOES. EVERYBODY WHO PAYS THE BILL DOES IT'S WRONG WHAT DOCTOR WOOD IS DOING IN THIS BILL IS PLUGGING THE HOLE THERE'S BEEN A TUNNEL LITIGATION TO STOP THIS HEY FOR DELAY INSIDIOUS ACTIVITY. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE BRAND NAME COMPANIES DRUG COMPANIES TRANSFER SOMETHING OF VALUE IS THE QUESTION TO DELAY THE COMPETITORS RESEARCH MARKING OR SALES IN A COMPETING VERSION OF THIS DRUG. I DON'T YOU GO ON A DETAILS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM ANY PHARMACIST IN THE ROOM. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THIS IS INTELLIGENT APPROACH IT SETS A STANDARD TO AVOID THIS ANTI COMPETITIVE. BEHAVIOR I ASK FOR YOUR RIVALS. THANK YOU MS MAJORITY LEADER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I RESPECT THE RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FOUR. IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO THE DELIVERY OF MEDICATIONS ON TO THE MARKET AND- WHEN THEIR PATENTS EXPIRE AND THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN BRAND NAME COMPANIES AND OTHER COMPANIES INCLUDING ENGINEER MANUFACTURERS AT. BELIEVE IT OR NOT ACTUALLY BRING SOME GENERIC DRUGS TO MARKET SOONER THAN. THEY LEGALLY COULD BE. THERE ARE MANY GENERIC MEDICATIONS AT A BECOME AVAILABLE DUE TO PATENT SUPPLEMENTS AND SOME OF THEM FOR YEARS BEFORE THOSE PATENTS WERE TO EXPIRE. BUT BECAUSE THIS BILL ALLOWS A CAUSE OF ACTION WITHIN FOUR YEARS AFTER SETTLEMENT AS OCCURRED THERE ARE MANY MEDICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PULLED OFF THE MARKET BECAUSE THOSE SUPPLEMENTS. MAY NOW BE CALLED INTO QUESTION. BASED ON DIFFERENT LEGAL STANDARDS IF THIS BILL IS APPROVED. THIS COULD CAUSE PRICES FOR MEDICATIONS TO INCREASE AS LOWER COST GENERICS. ARE PULLED OFF THE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME REAL EXAMPLES. NAIAS SPANS DRUG USE KINDA LOWER YOUR CHOLESTEROL MODIFIED VERSION OF NIACIN. HAS PRESCRIBED FOR HIGH CHOLESTEROL THE PATENT SETTLEMENT. I CAN HEAR MYSELF. A PATENT SUPPLEMENT ALLOWED GENERIC VERSIONS OF THIS DRUG ON THE MARKET LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THREE YEARS BEFORE ITS PATENT EXPIRED. THIS DRUG COSTS FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY TWO CENTS FOR TYPICAL PRESCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE GENERIC COMING AVAILABLE. NOW THE AVERAGE COST IS TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. IF YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH HIV. LIKE MANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS INCLUDING I AM. MANY HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED ABSECON AN ANTIVIRAL MEDICATION. THE COSTS OF THIS DRUG PRIOR TO A PATENT SETTLEMENT WAS TWELVE HUNDRED NINETY ONE SEVENTY ONE. FOR A TYPICAL PRESCRIPTION. BUT DUE TO A PATENT SETTLEMENT GENERICS WERE ALLOWED TO BE FILLED EIGHTEEN MONTHS EARLY. AND NOW HAVE THE AVERAGE COST OF LESS THAN HALF. AT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GO BACK TO THE HIGHER COST DRUG ONLY. THERE TO MORE WITH PRICE EXAMPLES MANY YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THESE YOUR PARENTS INCLUDING SOME MY RELATIVES HAVE BEEN USING CELEBREX FOR. ARTHRITIC CONDITIONS IT WAS. SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FORTY SEVEN THIRTY DOLLARS AND FORTY FOUR CENTS FOR THE STAND. NOW AN AVERAGE IS A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AND TWENTY SIX CENTS FOR THE GENERIC THE CAME ON THE MARKET A FULL YEAR EARLY DUE TO A PATENT SETTLEMENT. AND LUNESTA STREETS IN THE BUTTERFLIES ON TV FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA. THAT WAS NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE DOLLARS FOR A TYPICAL PRESCRIPTION AND NOW IT AVERAGES. FORTY DOLLARS AND SEVENTY EIGHT CENTS AND IT CAME TO MARKET DUE. TO A PATENT SETTLEMENT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS A PATENT SUPPLEMENTS ARE ONE WAY GENERIC COMPANIES WHO WANT TO SELL DRUGS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRING LOWER COST. DRUGS TO THE MARKET SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. WHILE THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR TRYING TO SOLVE A LARGE AND COMPLEX ISSUE. THIS BILL IS TOO BROADLY WRITTEN AND WILL UNFORTUNATELY DO NOTHING MORE THAN RAISE THE PRICE OF DRUGS. SOMETHING I KNOW WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT. FOR THOSE REASONS I ASKED FOR A NO VOTE ON AB TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU SENATOR. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING NONE THAT HERTZBERG YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE PHARMACOLOGIC HAS A REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THIS THE FIRST QUESTION IS THERE AN AGREEMENT WORST MONEY WAS PAID OR SOMETHING OF VALUE WAS PAID. THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION OF WELL IS IT PRO COMPETITIVE OR ANTI COMPETITIVE AND WE LOOK AT THE STANDARDS AND THEY WORK WITH THE WITH THE COMMUNITY THE WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH THIS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WERE WORRIED THAT SOMEHOW THE STANDARD WAS TOO HIGH IN TERMS OF PROVING THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS PRO COMPETITIVE BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT COULD BE PRO COMPETITIVE AND SO THIS IS ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO GET A DIFFERENT SET OF EYES ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND MAKE SUCH A DETERMINATION. TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REDUCE COSTS AND PRINT AND INCREASED. COMPETITION IN THE SPACE I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

MAJORITY LEADER'S READY SO MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN AND ACT REALLY INTO CONSUMER PRIVACY. IN HERTZBERG. VASE MARE WE'RE BACK ON PRIVACY. LAST YEAR AFTER MONTHS AND MONTHS OF HARD WORK THIS BODY TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER HOUSE IN THE GOVERNOR PASS THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT. BUT THIS ADDED AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS MANY PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND AMONG THOSE PROTECTIONS TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS FIRST. THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT INFORMATION A BUSINESS IS COLLECTING ABOUT YOU AND WHETHER IT'S BEING SOLD OR DISCLOSE. SECOND THE RIGHT TO TELL A BUSINESS NOT TO SELL YOUR INFORMATION. DISCLOSURE AND PERSONAL CONTROL. DISCLOSURE AND PERSONAL CONTROL THOSE WAR AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT. THAT LANDMARK POLICY CO AUTHORED MY. MY DEAR FRIEND FROM NAPPER SOMEWHERE THAT WINE COUNTRY. PUT CALIFORNIA AT THE LEADING EDGE OF DEFINING PRIVACY LAW NATIONWIDE AND IT WAS I THINK IS MOST MEMBERS HERE FOR WHICH YOU WERE HERE TO BOARD FOR TO YOU TO STEP FORWARD. BUT MUCH TO MY DISMAY INTO THIS MAY OF MY. CO AUTHOR FROM APA. HOWEVER PERFECT HE IS THE BILL WASN'T PERFECT. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE NEEDED AND WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO DUE TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT AS AND IT'S TWENTY TWENTY IMPLEMENTATION DATE AS THE TWENTY TWENTY IMPLEMENTATION DATES APPROACHES UP. APPROACHES AND SEVERAL CONCERNS REMAIN. WITH THE GUIDANCE OF THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHO IS TO MY RIGHT. THIS MEASURE ONLY PHYSICALLY. THIS MEASURES RESULT OF EXTENSIVE WORK TO BRING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO THE TABLE AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST MPLEMENT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT WITHOUT ON INTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE BILL TAKES TO CRITICAL TO CRITICAL ISSUES WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. IT ADDS A REASONABLE STANDARD TO AVOID OVER EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION AND IT REMOVES RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON USING INFORMATION FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE GOVERNMENTAL RECORDS IN ORDER TO HELP THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER. PROTECTION ACT. AVOID POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. IT ALSO AVOIDS COSTLY CONFUSION IT WOULD PROLONG IMPLEMENTATION PUSHING BACK WHEN CALIFORNIA'S COULD UTILIZE THEIR NEW RIGHTS PROMISED TO THEM BY THE SEA CPA. IT IS A IMPORTANT GET SMALL BUT YET IMPORTANT PART OF THE LARGER SAGA AS WE DEAL WITH PER TWO WITH PRIVACY AND THE UNBELIEVABLE CHANGES THAT ALL OF US ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THIS TECHNOLOGY INFORMS THE FUTURE. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES TO MY LEFT.

ANLYZED IT AFFECTED AGAINST US IN OUR POLITICAL WORLD IN IN OUR- PERSONAL LIVES AND FOR OUR FAMILY THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT IS THE FIRST AND ONLY ONE IN THE COUNTRY. AND SO I BELIEVE IT IS BEEN CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAINTAIN ITS ELEMENTS WITHOUT WEAKENING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL OR TAP LOCATION. THIS MEASURE. ACCOMPLISHES THAT GOAL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IT DOES GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY SO THAT AS IT IS IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. IT WILL MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE PRIVACY CONCEPTS WHICH WERE ARTICULATED BY MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LA ON DISCLOSURE AND CONTROL. THIS IS A MEASURE THAT MAINTAINS THOSE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS WHILE PROVIDING DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE TO THE INDUSTRIES AS THEY MOVE FORWARD THIS IS ONE OF A FEW ADDITIONAL BILLS THAT WILL BE SEEING. ON THIS FLOOR. THAT ADDRESS THIS SIMILAR CONCEPT BUT DO IT WITH THE SAME PARAMETERS EXPECTATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS PROTECTED AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE MON AN ACT RELATING TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS SENATE RIGHT CASKEY MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE SIXTH ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCURACY IN THE REPORTING OF GIFTS IN KIND THESE ARE THE NON CASH. DONATIONS BY CHARITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO IS A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL NOT AB ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE ADDRESSES REPORTED PRACTICES BY SOME NOT ALL CHARITIES BUT BY SOME CHARITIES THAT GROSSLY INFLATE THE VALUE OF THE REPORT REVENUE. AND PROGRAM EXPENSES CITY ATTORNEY GENERAL ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE DONATIONS OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS. OVER VALUATION THAT'S THE PROBLEM OVER VALUATION OF SUCH DONATIONS LEADS THAN INFLATED TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE CHARITY WHICH MAKES A CHARITY APPEAR MORE CHARITABLE INEFFICIENT UP TO THE PUBLIC AND POTENTIAL DONORS. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE WHICH REQUIRED THESE CHARITIES EMPLOY A DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR PHARMACEUTICAL DONATIONS WHEN REPORTING ANNUAL DATA TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. BUT ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE DONOR HAS RESTRICTED THE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THE DRUGS TO BE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHOSE ONLY RESTRICTING THE USE OF THE DRUGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE IN THESE CASES. THE BILL REQUIRES CHARITIES TO REPORT THE VALUE OF THE DONATION TO REFLECT ITS FAIR VALUE IN. THE MARKET. IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE ULTIMATE. A BIG AND DISTRIBUTED NOT THE VALUE OF WHAT IS GOING TO BE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES MARK. IF THE DONATION HAS NO SUCH DONOR RESTRICTIONS ON ITS USE THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY WE SAY THAT AGAIN IF THE DONOR IF THAT THE NATION DOESN'T HAVE A SUCH A RESTRICTION BY THE DONOR. FOR THIS ULTIMATE USE IT DOES NOT APPLY. AS AMENDED THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO PHARMACEUTICAL DONATIONS. THEREFORE IN KIND DONATIONS FOR CLOTHES FOR FOOD FOR TOOLS AND ALL OTHER KINDS OF IN KIND ARE ALSO EXEMPT FROM THE BILL. IN ALL THOSE CASES INDUSTRY CAN PRINCIPLES STILL APPLY WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THE VALUATION A DONATION RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. DELAYED THE IMPLEMENTATION BY YEAR WITH THAT I REGION I VOTE.

THIS PLACE SO LITTLE RESPECT TO THE SENATOR PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I'M ALSO DISAPPOINTED DIDN'T GO TO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER THAT IS OF NATIONAL IMPORT AND THIS BILL IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE APPROPRIATE VENUE I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT WON'T BE IMPLEMENTED FOR YEAR WHICH- DOES GIVE THE. FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD SOMETIME ALTHOUGH THERE IKE A GOVERNMENT TO THEY DON'T MOVE AS QUICKLY AS YOU WOULD LIKE BUT THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD. THROUGH ITS NOT FOR PROFIT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. HAS ALREADY TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO EVALUATE THE PRACTICES AND PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF NON CASH GIFTS IN KIND. THEY HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE ACCOUNTING PROFESSION CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS STATE CHARITY REGULATORS AND CHARITY WATCHDOG GROUPS TO ADDRESS THE VERY CONCERNS RAISED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THIS GROUP IS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING HOW GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRACTICES CAN BE REVISED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OVER THE VALUATION OF GIFTS IN KIND FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES. THEREFORE MISTER PRESIDENT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE AN A STRONG NATIONAL ORGANIZATION LIKE WE CALL IF AS BEER THAT THAT BE IS BE THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD TO COME DOWN AND REQUIRE THIS FOR ALL NON PROFITS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS OPPOSED TO BEING AND OUT LIAR HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HAVING A SEPARATE APPROACH. SO THIS BILL SHOULD BE DEFERRED IT SHOULDN'T BE DEFERRED ONE YEAR BUT IT SHOULD BE DEFERRED TO TELL THE FAST BEAT OUR FASB. HAS ISSUED A PROPAGATION ON THIS MATTER IF BASS WE DOESN'T GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER WITHIN A YEAR TWO OR THREE THEN WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS LEGISLATION BUT IN THE MEANTIME I'M A NO.

AND MAKE YOUR NEIGHBOR SAFER. AB THIRTY EIGHT WITH LAUNCHES STATEWIDE PILOT PROGRAM FOR FIVE YEARS. TO START THE PROCESS OF ALLOWING HOMEOWNERS TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES. NOT JUST ON A HOME BY HOME BASIS BUT ON A COMMUNITY BASIS. THE CLIMATE CRISIS PRESENTS US WITH NOT JUST AN ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE BUT THE CIVIC CHALLENGE. WE'RE NEIGHBORS ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK WITH OTHER NEIGHBORS TO MAKE THEMSELVES SAFER. IF YOU RETROFIT YOUR HOME AND YOUR NEIGHBOR DOES NOT YOUR HOUSE CAN STILL BURNED DOWN. AN INSURANCE INDUSTRY RECOGNIZES THAT BECAUSE. THEY'RE STARTING TO LEAVE THE MARKET PLACE WE'RE SEEING CANCELLATIONS AND NON RENEWALS ALL OVER THE STATE. SO THIS MEASURE IS NOT JUST ABOUT. EMPOWERING HOMEOWNERS TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL SAFER. BUT IS MY HOPE THAT IT'S A MEASURE TO GET US BACK TO A SUSTAINABLE INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. AND HOPEFULLY GIVE PEOPLE SOME TOOLS TO TAKE CONTROL BACK OVER THEIR LIVES AND NOT JUST TO FEEL POWERLESS IN THE FACE OF FIRE. I APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WORK ON THIS MEASURE. FUNDING IS GOING TO BE A CRITICAL ISSUE OVER THE BREAK. WE HAVE A BOND PENDING THAT HAS FUNDING FOR THIS HOME HARDENING THAT WE'VE NOT YES PASSED OFF THIS FLOOR. BUT I THINK WILL BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT. BUT THE BILL DOES NOT SPECIFY A PARTICULAR FUNDING SOURCES. IT IT TALKS ABOUT UTILIZING A BROAD RANGE OF FUNNY INCLUDING SUGGESTING FEDERAL FUNDS FROM THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM. AND PRO ACTIVELY TARGETING AT RISK COMMUNITIES. SO I HOPE WE ALL STEP UP TODAY AND START GIVING SOME POWER BACK TO OUR PEOPLE. THE FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE FIRES WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. THANK YOU CENTER STERN ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

SECOND IT REQUIRES A MARKET PLACE THE PERMITS SELLERS TO PAY TO INCREASE THE RANKING OF THEIR PRODUCT WE KNOW THAT IS DONE YOU WANT TO GET YOUR YOUR BUSINESS UP HIGHER WHEN SOMEONE CLICKS ON AND YOU PAY THE TO DO THAT IT WILL REQUIRE THE MARKET PLACE TO DESCRIBE THE PROCESS AND. PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE SELLER CAN OBTAIN THAT WRITTEN. PRICE INFORMATION WHAT THEY'RE CHARGING TO ONE COMPANY OR ANOTHER TO GET THEMSELVES UP HIGHER IN THE LIST. THIRD THE BILL REQUIRES MARKET PLACES TO PROVIDE THAT SELLER WITH A WRITTEN STATEMENT OF REASONS WHEN THAT SELLERS ACCOUNT IS BEING SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED FOR A VIOLATION OF LAW OR SOME TERM OR CONDITION OF THE MARKET PLACE.

BOTH ONLINE AND PHYSICALLY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE TRANSPARENCY EXISTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON THESE RETAIL SPACES TO REACH CUSTOMERS.

THIS BILL WORKS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF HARASSMENT AND FEAR IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY AB FIVE FORTY SEVEN WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE TRAINING ADVISORY COMMITTEE CREATED UNDER THE PROPERTY SERVICE WORKER PROTECTION ACT RECONVENES TO DEVELOP REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFIED ORGANIZATIONS AND PEER TRAINERS THAT EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO USE IN TRAINING. I HOPE YOU NOTICED YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN SOME OF THESE JANITORIAL WORKERS AT THE CAPITOL YESTERDAY AND TODAY IN THEIR WONDER WOMEN OUTFITS AND SOME OF THEM ARE RIGHT HERE TODAY IN THE GALLERY. FOR YEARS THESE WOMEN HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO BRING ATTENTION TO WHAT GOES ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE WE'RE ASLEEP AND THEY'RE WORKING. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE DANGERS THAT THEY FACE. AND THEY SLOWLY HAVE ONE STEP BY STEP. THE ATTENTION THAT THEY SO WELL DESERVE AND WHILE MUCH ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE CELEBRITIES AND TO FAMOUS PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE HARASSED. IT IS TIME THAT WOMEN WHO WORK IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY ARE ALSO PAID ATTENTION TO FOR WHAT THEY GO THROUGH. THIS LEGISLATION EMPOWERS THOSE JANITORIAL WORKERS BY UTILIZING EXISTING PEER COUNSELORS OR WHAT IS KNOWN IN OUR CULTURE AS PROMOTE TAUGHT US TO PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT TRAINING ON HOW TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IN THE WORKPLACE. I ALSO RISE TO CONGRATULATE MY SISTERS FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK AND EVERYONE WHO HAS SUPPORTED THEM TO GET AS FAR AS THEY HAVE COME TODAY THEY TRULY ARE WONDER WOMEN AND HEROES.

AND SHE'SREADY MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FORTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER KAMLAGER-DOVE AN ACT RELATING TO IMPLICIT BIAS CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WILL REQUIRE ATTORNEYS AND JUDGES. TO PARTAKE IN CONTINUAL EDUCATION ON IMPLICIT BIAS EVERY THREE YEARS AND REQUIRE THE COURT PERSONNEL TAKE THIS CONTINUING EDUCATION EVERY TWO YEARS. IMPLICIT BIAS IS THE UNCONSCIOUS AND UNINTENTIONAL MENTAL SHORT CUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN AND FRANKLY DO DEVELOP. THAT AFFECTS US ALL. IT'S OFTEN SUBTLE ASSOCIATIONS WE MAKE BETWEEN GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND STEREOTYPES ABOUT THOSE GROUPS IT'S USUALLY NOT INTENTIONAL SOMETIMES IT'S JUST WHAT WE GROW UP WITH THAT WE DON'T REALIZE THAT WE HAVE THESE BIASES THEY'RE NOT MALICIOUS BUT THEY'RE THERE. AND BECAUSE THERE ARE WE ADDRESS. TAX ON THE PEOPLE AGAINST WHOM THAT BIAS IS REFLECTED. SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES EMOTIONALLY SOMETIMES ECONOMICALLY AND CERTAINLY THERE SOMETHING THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR BELIEVES AND I DON'T THINK MOST OF US BELIEVE ARE THE WAY WE WANT TO LIVE IN THE KINDS OF REACTOR OF RELATIONSHIPS WE WANT TO HAVE WITH OTHERS SO WE HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT EVERYONE DOES INDEED HAVE THEIR OWN UNCONSCIOUS AN IMPLICIT BIASES. MOST OF US SAYS I SURE WOULD LIKE TO BE FREE OF THOSE BIASES IN THOSE ATTITUDES THAT LEAD US TO JUDGE PEOPLE BASED ON THE SOCIAL CATEGORIES THEY BELONG TO SUCH AS RACE GENDER ETHNICITY RELIGION ETCETERA WE KNOW THAT EXPLICIT BIAS PURCHASE LIKE RACISM SEXISM AND OTHER FORMS OF BIGOTRY AND DESPITE PEOPLE'S BEST INTENTIONS RESEARCHERS. HAVE FOUND THAT SUBJECTS CAN CONSCIOUSLY EMBRACE IDEAS OF FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY AND YET ON TESTS THAT MAY OR SO CONSCIOUS TENDENCY STILL SHOW A STRONG PROPENSITY TO LEAN ON THE STEREOTYPES THE FILL IN THE BLANKS ABOUT PEOPLE. THEY DO NOT KNOW. GIVEN THE JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS AND COURT PERSONNEL PROVIDE THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE WITH WHICH WE ALL AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER ARE LIKELY TO ACCESS IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE WITHOUT SUFFERING BIAS THAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS MEASURE.

TO TWELVE SENATE GLAZER YOU PREPARED HE IS MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY THE FIFTEEN NINETEEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW AN ACCOLADE HEALING ARTS CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU I MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS SPENT A LONG DAY ARE READY THAT APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION THIS IS THE SUNSET BILL FOR THE DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE OTHER SUNSET BILLS THAT WILL BE PRESENTING. HI IS THE PRODUCT OF COMPREHENSIVE SUNSET REVIEW OVERSIGHT. I TAKEN BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN THE SENATE. IN THE SENATE AND IN THE ASSEMBLY. PASSAGE OF THIS BILL IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE OPERATION THE DENTAL BOARD WHICH IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR REPEAL AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. NOW THE THIS BILL DOES A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC THINGS THAT I ONE OF THESE HAVE ON THE RECORD IT MERGES THE BOARDS TO SPECIAL FUNDS ELIMINATES THE SUSPENDED REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT PRACTICAL EXAM REQUIRES THE BOARD REPORT ON THE STATUS OF PORTFOLIO EXAMINATIONS THE TRANSITIONS APPROVAL FOR FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOLS TO A NATIONAL CREDITOR HE CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY LIES. AND REQUIRES DANCES ON PROBATION TO MAKE DISCLOSURES JUST LIKE. A DOCTOR'S. HI THIS BILL ALSO MAKES VARIOUS ADJUSTMENTS TO THE DENTAL PRACTICE ACT IN RESPONSE TO ISSUES RAISED DURING THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS AND AS I SAID THAT PROCESS BEGAN FEBRUARY. THAN EXTENSIVE COMMITTEE REPORT AND WE WENT THROUGH HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE SPRING AND SUMMER. EVERY FOR THE PROVISION IN THIS BILL IS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO AN ISSUE DISCUSSED IN THE COMMITTEES JOIN SUNSET BACKGROUND PAPER. WHICH AS I SAID WAS PUBLISHED LAST FEBRUARY. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASTRONOMICAL. THANK YOU SENATOR. EIGHTY DISCUSSION DEBATE CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT TO THE QUESTION FOR THE FLOOR MANAGER PLEASE. MISTER SERRA GLAZER YES AT THE HORSE THANK YOU MISTER MISTER PRESIDENT I. HAD. INDIVIDUALS COME IN ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS PARTICULAR. ITEM THIS BILL AND. YOU KNOW I THINK I GOT MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED BUT AFTER DEALING WITH THE APPOINTMENTS I WONDERED WHY. A BILL THAT SHOULD JUST BE EXTENDING A SUNSET WOULD HAVE SOMETHING SO CONTROVERSIAL IN IT THAT IT WOULD MOTIVATE. SO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT WITH ME WHEN THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A IN A SEPARATE BILL SO WE TAKE CARE OF THE SUNSET AND ONE AND THEN THIS X. RAY PROVISION IN ANOTHER I'M JUST WONDERING SHOULDN'T THESE SUNSET BILLS BE LIKE OMNIBUS BILLS I JUST KIND OF. SHOULD BE FLYING THROUGH ALMOST ON CONSENT THAT'S MY QUESTION MISTER PRESIDENT. I GUESS I HAVE A TWO PART ANSWER IF I MAY FIRST WHEN THE LAST TIME YOU HAD A DENTAL EXAM. I JUST HAD A ROOT CANAL. AND I HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS SO I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'D NEED TO REMIND ME. WELL FOR SOME THIS BILL IS LIKE ROOT CANAL. BUT NO MORE SERIOUSLY. TELL YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATIONS IN EVERY FIELD OF HEALTH CARE IN THIS ONE IS CERTAINLY NO EXCEPTION TO THAT AND TELE DENTISTRY IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES IN WHICH FOLKS ARE. TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT AND INNOVATIVE WAYS AND IN SOME CASES IN THAT REMOTELY WHERE YOU DON'T GO INTO AN OFFICE AND YOU HAVE THAT EXAMINATION SO THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION IN THIS SPACE. AND SO IT REALLY WITHIN THE LAST FEW SEVEN LATE IN THE PROCESS THOSE WHO PRACTICE TELE DENTISTRY HAVE. WORRIED THAT THIS THIS SUNSET BILL AND THE PROVISIONS IN IT REGARDING STANDARDS OF CARE AFFECT THEIR BUSINESS MODEL HOW THEY INTERACT WITH PATIENTS WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO. AND THAT IS WHETHER OR NOT A PERSON. WHO IS GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT TELL OF DENTISTRY. IS PROVIDING TO HI A LICENSED DENTIST BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU. I THAT SERVICE OUT OF STATE YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT REVIEWED BY A LICENSED DENTIST IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHETHER OR NOT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SUNSET EXTENSION. IS GOING TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO HAVE DONE A AN EXAM. THAT MEETS THE STANDARD OF CARE. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT LAST MINUTE CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY THESE COMPANIES THAT I THINK YOU'VE GOTTEN THOSE VISITS IN THOSE PHONE CALLS. BUT I THINK FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW THE CHAIR OF A BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS THE ASSEMBLY AND MYSELF. AND OUR STAFF TO HAVE LOOKED AT THE CONCERNS THAT THEY'VE RAISED. WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL DOES NOTHING DIFFERENT TO EXTEND THEIR SANDERS A PRESS OF CARE THAT. ARE IN LAW. THAT WE DO REQUIRE THAT. A LICENSE DENTISTS BE A PARTICIPANT IN THOSE TYPES OF PROCEDURES THEY ARE INVOLVED IN. AND DATE THAT THEY'RE GONNA MOVE PEOPLE'S TEETH IN SOME FIELD OF WORK. THEY'RE ACTUALLY MOVING PEOPLE'S TEETH. THAT THEY HAVE TO IF WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THAT THAT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE. INDIVIDUALS ARE FOR THE WHICH THIS BILL WE THINK DOES AND ITS EXTENSION SO I THINK AND HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. WELL IF IT COMES CLOSE IF I MAY SURPRISE. ASK ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. OF COURSE YOU MAY RESIDENT TO. I THE COR THE QUESTION IS THE GOOD AS HIM A MAN HAS BEEN DOING A LOT OF SUNSET EXTENSION BILLS THEY'RE ALL. PRETTY GENERIC IN IN A IN ANOTHER THEY JUST FLY THROUGH. BUT THIS ONE IS GENERATED A LOT OF. ACTIVITY SO I I'M JUST WONDERING WHY DID WE ANSWERED THE LANGUAGE WHY DON'T WE JUST DO A SEPARATE BILL. SO WE CAN YOU KNOW GET THE X. SUNSET TAKING CARE OF EXTENDED IN AND THEN DEAL WITH THE- PEACE MOVEMENT IN A IN A SEPARATE DEBATE. WELL WITH A THIS IS I THINK THE FULL REVIEW OF EACH OF THESE HEROES IN AND THE WORK THAT'S DONE. I DOES LOOK AT POLICY IN FACT IF YOU READ OUR POLICY PAPERS THAT. OUR STAFF PROVIDES BEFORE EVERY HEARING YOU'RE GOING TO SEE AN EXAMINATION OF A LOT OF ISSUES INCLUDING STAFFING IN FINDING AN- ENFORCEMENT SEND AND ALSO INCLUDES POLICY SO IT'S A COMMON PRACTICE TO. EXAMINE THE WIDE RANGE OF WORKING BEHAVIOR IN THESE HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND TO APPLY WHAT WE THINK ARE APPROPRIATE. CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN IN IN BILLS LIKE THIS SO I DON'T THINK THAT WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS ANY BIG RADICAL DEPARTURE. SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED DEBATED TO EXAMINE PUBLIC HEARINGS THROUGHOUT. THE WHOLE YEAR. AND I DON'T THINK THAT I THINK IT'S IT FITS WITHIN THE PRACTICE OF OUR WORK AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL FIND THAT IT AS A WHOLE IT'S SOMETHING THAT. PROVIDES THE PROPER LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SIR MORE LIKE CENTER PAN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT CENTER I STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN WHICH WILL REQUIRE DENNIS TO DISCLOSE BASIC AND THEN FINDING INFORMATION TO THE PATIENT'S PRESERVE THE ABILITY FOR PATIENTS REPORT LICENSEES A DENTAL BOARD EVEN THE SIGN A NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. AND REQUIRED A DENTIST MUST REVIEW THEIR PATIENTS MOST RECENTLY TAKEN X. RAYS TO CONFIRM THE BONE STRUCTURES UNDERNEATH THE GUM LINE ARE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN ANY TYPE OF ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT LET'S KEEP IN MIND YOUR TEETH DON'T JUST FLOAT THERE THEY HAVE TO BE ANCHORED IN THE JOB AND THE BONE AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HEALTH OF THAT BONE IS. YOU CAN'T PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE CARE SO PROVIDING DENTAL CARE TO PATIENTS ESPECIALLY THE MOVEMENT OF TEETH WITHOUT THIS DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION INCLUDING REVIEWING X. RAYS AND I'VE ACTUALLY TOWARD THAT TELL A DENTAL PROGRAMS. DO YOU CAN HAVE A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS HARM BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S LYING UNDERNEATH AND THAT INCLUDES PAIN CRUDE CRACK LOOSE TEETH GUM RECESSION TO FLOSS AND I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS AN EX EXISTING STANDARD OF CARE SO IN TERMS OF THIS BEING AN EXTENSION. ARE OF THE BOARD. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT. WAS NEARLY PUT IN INTO THE BOARD RENEWAL. I WOULD LIKE NOTE THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPEDE A DENNIS ABILITY TO MAKE CLINICAL JUDGMENTS IT MERELY SETS A FLOOR FOR NECESSARY DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION THAT WE EXPECT DENNIS TO REVIEW PRIOR TO DIAGNOSTIC DOSING IN TREATING PATIENTS WITH OR DIE CARE AGAIN ESTABLISHING YELP ACTUALLY ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING MAINTAINING A STANDARD OF CARE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CERTAINLY SUPPORTED BY. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE NOW TO ME OF THE MOUTH SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTES EVEN IT IS TO ENSURE THAT BOTH AS WE HAVE NEW TECHNOLOGY TELEHEALTH OF AUDIENCE OR THE I'M A SUPPORTER OF TELE DENTISTRY. BUT WE NEED TO. WHATEVER MODALITY. FOR GETTING YOUR TEETH TAKEN CARE OF. IT IS OUR JOB AND THE BOARD JOB THE DENTAL BOARD TO PROTECT THE PATIENTS AND BE SURE THEIR SAFETY IS A PRIORITY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I THOUGHT. CONSIDER PAN CABALLERO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT LET ME START OFF BY SAYING I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL THIS IS A SENSE THAT EXTENSION BILL BUT I HAD THE SAME VISITS THAT MY GOOD CALLING FROM COSTA MESA HAD AND THE CONCERN HERE IS THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW IN THE PAST OUR RULES REQUIRED THAT IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO AS SUNSET EXTENSION THAT IT NOT CONTAIN ANY POLICY SO THAT WAY WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE SUN THESE BOARDS DO NOT SEND SAID AND THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATELY EXTENDED SB AND GIVEN OUR OUR INTENSE REVIEW THAT WE DO IN OUR BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. CODE SECTION BUT BUT THE THIS THE IF THERE IS POLICY IT'S GOING TO AFFECTED THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP THAT THAT BE IN A DIFFERENT BILL AND I THINK I AM LIKE I SAID I'M GONNA END UP SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I'M A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE GETTING THESE PHONE CALLS AND VISITS FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT SAY WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY HAVE A ROBUST ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE POLICY ISSUES AND THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE REQUESTING A NO VOTE I WILL AND I DO URGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I THINK WE NEED TO RETURN TO THE DAYS WHEN WE JUST AS THE SUN SETS AND DIDN'T WIN INCLUDE A LOT OF DIFFICULT POLICY ISSUES YOUR REMEMBER IF YOU WERE AROUND THAT GOVERNOR BROWN WAS FACED WITH THAT ISSUE AND ENDED UP SUNSET IN THE NURSING BOARD AND IT WAS A BIG MESS AND I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT BIG MESS AT THE TIME THAT IT HAPPENED I'M REAL FAMILIAR WITH HOW DIFFICULT IT IS WENT ABOARD SUNSETS WE JUST CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AND SO BUT WITH. ALL DUE RESPECT TO ACT. WE MAY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE OTHER WAY. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SITTING NINE CENTER GLAZE REMAIN CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THOSE FROM ORANGE COUNTY IN SALINAS AND CERTAINLY THE SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO FOR WEIGHING IN WITH THEIR VIEWS. YOU KNOW IN IN I APPRECIATE THE IF THE FEEDBACK ABOUT SUNSET REVIEWS BUT KEEP IN MIND IN IN THESE HEALTH PROFESSIONS. WE DON'T LEGISLATE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THESE PROFESSIONS WE RELY UPON THE PROFESSIONALS IN THOSE FIELDS PROVIDE STANDARDS OF PRACTICE AND HOW THEY GO ABOUT THEIR WORK AND WHAT WE DO ALRP IN MANY CASES IN ALMOST ALL IN ALL CASES REINFORCE. THOSE PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COULD THAT THE STANDARDS OF CARE ARE IN PLACE AND THAT'S REALLY OUR FOCUS AND SO WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IN ALL AREAS OF HEALTH CARE WITH INNOVATION HAPPENING IS THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO I ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES IN THAT RESPECT AND SO WHEN WE COME IN AND DO THE SAME THING WE DO AND A LOT OF OUR SENSE THAT'S WHICH IS IT REINFORCED THE STANDARDS OF CARE IF. IT DOES CREATE SOME ANGST IF THEY FEEL LIKE. THEY'RE STRETCHING. THE MARGIN IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE FITTING. THE STANDARDS OF CARE. AND SO IN THE IN THE DENTAL WORLD YOU KNOW. AT THAT THAT IT YOU YOU KNOW THAT INNOVATION ITS TEETH TEETH WHITENING YOU HAVE TO GO INTO A DENTIST TO GET TEETH WHITENING. DO YOU HAVE TO GO INTO A DENTIST TO GET VENEERS. YOU HAVE TO GO INTO A DENTIST TO HAVE ALIGNMENTS. AND THE ANSWER IN ALMOST ALL THESE CASES THERE YES AND- AND THEN IT DEPENDS. BUT IN THE IN THE CASE OF ALIGNMENTS WHERE YOU ARE MOVING THE BONE OF SOMEONE'S MOUTH. THE STANDARDS ARE CARE. REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE A FULL EXAMINATION WHICH MAY IN MANY CASES WILL INCLUDE AN X. RAY. SO WHEN YOU START TO MESS AROUND IN TELEHEALTH AN ENEMY MESS AROUND BUT WHEN YOU START PRACTICING IN THE FIELD OF TELEHEALTH. WE ARE NOT YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY IN YOUR OFFICE. THEY FORCES THE STANDARDS OF CARE YOU HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN FORCE THAT THEY ARE. APPLIED APPROPRIATELY. AND SO WHEN WE DO SUNSET REVIEW WHEN WE TRY TO REINFORCE. THOSE COULDN'T THOSE HEALTH CARE AND WHO WERE PROTECTIONS. AYE THOSE COMPANIES THAT MAYBE ENGAGE IN THAT TYPE OF WORK CAN GET A LITTLE UNEASY. AND MAYBE NOT THE IN AND ENGAGED IN OUR WORK AS THEY SHOULD BE BUT- IT HAPPENS. AND IN THIS CASE. THE CONCERN FOR REYES ONLY RECENTLY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS NOT ONE BEGAN OUR PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE SOME. UNEASINESS ON THE FLOOR CALL THAT HAVE BEEN MADE.

CENTER MONEY THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS UNDER EXISTING LAW PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO ALLOW EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES REASONABLE TIME OFF WITHOUT LOSS OF COMPENSATION TO PARTICIPATE IN ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS SUCH AS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN MATTERS BEFORE PERSONNEL COMMISSIONS THIS IS REFERRED TO AS RELEASE TIME. ALTHOUGH CURRENT REGULATIONS PROVIDE REASONABLE TIME OFF WITHOUT LOSS OF PAY TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THE LAW IS INEFFECTIVE IN ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO PARTICIPATE IN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS BECAUSE CURRENT LAW IS INCONSISTENT ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS.

THREE ONE FOUR WILL RESULT IN MAJOR STATE COSTS LIKELY TO COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS A RESULT OF INCLUDING ATTENDANCE AT A NEW EMPLOYER UNION ORIENTATION AS A COVERED ACTIVITY ALSO KNOWN AS RELEASE TIME. RELEASE TIME IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PUBLIC SUBSIDY FOR UNION ACTIVITIES IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHY TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE ON THE HOOK FOR PAYING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES WHICH IS NOT BENEFIT THE TAXPAYER AT ALL. WHEN YOU TO MEMBERS PAY DUES TO THE UNION TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES. THIS TIME. SHOULD BE EITHER UNPAID LEAVE DONE OUTSIDE OF WORK HOURS OR THE UNION SHOULD REIMBURSE A PUBLIC AGENCY FOR THE PAY PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEE ON TOP OF ALL THIS AB THREE ONE FOUR REQUIRES TAXPAYERS TO PAY THE SALARY OF A PUBLIC EMPLOYEE. WHILE THEY ARE PREPARING FOR UNION MEETINGS BUT DOES NOT CLEARLY DEFINED WHAT IT MEANS TO BE PREPARING. THIS IS RIGHT FOR ABUSE SHOULD THE EMPLOYEE BE PAID BY THE TAXPAYER WIN HERE SHE IS SHOWERING AND GETTING DRESSED FOR A MEETING. BOB BRUSHING THEIR TEETH OR SHOPPING FOR NEW CLOTHES TO WEAR FOR THE MEETING. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO BE WELL RESTED PRIOR TO A BIG MEETING PERHAPS EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE PAID EIGHT HOURS SLEEP.

SENATOR HUESO MOVES THE CALL NOW MEMBERS WE ARE MOVING BACK TO UNFINISHED BUSINESS FILE ITEM TWENTY SEVEN CENTER SKINNER I SEE THAT SHE IS PREPARED MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWO A SIX BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATED TO COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SOME VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT BACK FROM CONCURRENT SB TWO OH SIX. MY AWARENESS OF THE ISSUE OF STUDENT ATHLETIC EXPLICATION REALLY BEGAN BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WHEN I HEARD A LECTURE BY PROFESSOR HARRY EDWARDS WHO REALLY EXPRESSED THIS AS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. WORDS WAS THE ORGANIZER OF THE BLACK ATHLETE BOYCOTT OF THE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT OLYMPICS HE DESCRIBED COLLEGE SPORTS RELIANCE ON UNPAID BLACK LABOR WHICH GENERATED GREAT WELL. FOR ALL INVOLVED EXCEPT THE ATHLETES. SINCE THEN THIS VIEW IS BEEN REINFORCED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY SOME OF MY FAVORITE ATHLETES CREMIN ABDUL JABBAR ANDRE EAGLE DOLLAR DRAYMOND GREEN AND LEBRON JAMES. BUT WHAT MAY BE LESS EVIDENCE IS HOW THE N. C. TWO WAYS RULES NEGATIVELY IMPACT EACH AND EVERY STUDENT ATHLETE. THOSE RULES RIDICULOUS PROHIBIT A SWIMMER FROM BEING ABLE TO TEACH SWIMMING LESSONS STOPPED AT NAPA LEADS HOME GROWN T. SHIRT BUSINESS AND SANCTION TO NATALIE TO TRY TO HOLD A FUNDRAISER FOR THE FAMILY OF A TEAMMATE WHO HAD DIED IN PRACTICE. SB REAL COLLEGE SPORTS MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND IT BENEFITS COLLEGES BROADCAST NETWORKS CORPORATE SPONSORS THE NC TWO EIGHT MANY MANY MORE TOP COLLEGE COACHES MAKE. FORTY NINE MILLION A YEAR AND IN FACT IN FORTY OUT OF FIFTY STATES INCLUDING OUR OWN BE COLLEGE COACHES ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST PAID STATE EMPLOYEES THE SAME HIGHLY PAID COACHES HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET ENDORSEMENT DEALS AND MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY ON TOP OF THEIR SALARIES. MEANWHILE CONTROVERSY TO POP YOUR BILL POPULAR BELIEF MOST STUDENT ATHLETES DO NOT GET SCHOLARSHIPS YES THE ELITE STUDENT ATHLETES THAT WE- READ ABOUT WATCH ALL THE TIME. YES THEY GET A SCHOLARSHIP DOES IT COVER ALL OF THEIR AND THEIR FAMILIES COSTS NO BUT MOST OTHER STUDENT ATHLETES ESPECIALLY WOMEN IN THOSE IN LOWER TIER SPORTS THEY DO NOT GET SCHOLARSHIPS AND IN COMMITTEE WE HEARD FROM. OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST. HEARING TO FARO A REPORT AT CAL. OUT HOW SHE OPTED NOT TO EXERCISE HER OLYMPIC RIGHTS WHERE SHE WOULD HAVE CONTROL OF HER OWN NAME IMAGINE LIKENESS TO GET SPONSORSHIPS AND ENDORSEMENTS BECAUSE BY DOING SO SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO QUIT GROWING FOR CAL AND IF SHE QUIT GROWING FOR CAL. SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PRACTICE EVERY DAY AND NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE EQUIPMENT AND SUCH AND SHE COULDN'T ENSURE THAT ENDORSEMENT DEAL SHE GOT WOULD COVER THE TYPE ACOSTA CHEE WOULD INCUR. TO KEEP UP WITH HER SUPPORT. STANFORD TOPS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER HOLLY HE LEE HODSON EXPRESSED THAT. FOR WOMEN ATHLETES WHO BASICALLY HAVE NO ABILITY TO GO PRO BECAUSE WE DON'T SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ATHLETES THE COLLEGE MAY BE THE ONLY TIME THAT SHE COULD MONETIZE AT ALL. THE SKILL AND HER ATHLETIC PROWESS BUT THE NC TO A RULES PREVENT HER AS WELL AS EVERY COLLEGE ATHLETE MIND YOU EXCEPT FOR I BELIEVE TENNIS PLAYERS CAN TAKE HOME WHAT'S YEAR TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PURSE BUT LET'S SET THAT ASIDE EVERY OTHER COLLEGE ATHLETE. CANNOT USE THE SKILL THE THING THAT'S THEIR FAMILY AND THEM HAVE SPORTS SO MUCH HARD WORK AND TIME INTO TO EARN ANY INCOME. SB TWO OH SIX SIX IS THIS SB TWO OH SIX WILL GIVE OUR- STUDENT ATHLETES TO GO TO COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA THE SAME RIGHTS THAT OLYMPIC ATHLETES HAVE WHICH IS THE RIGHT TO THEIR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS. SB TWO OH SIX DOES NOT REQUIRE OUR COLLEGES TO PAY THE THINGS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IN SOME SOCIAL MEDIA. IS INACCURATE COLLEGES DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE ATHLETES AND IN FACT SOME ATHLETES MAY NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SO EVERY ATHLETE IS NOT GUARANTEED ANY MONEY UNDER SB TWO OH SIX ONLY THOSE THAT CHOOSE TO. USE THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS TO MONETIZE THEIR TALENT. AND YES WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESTORE THESE RIGHT STORE STUDENT ATHLETES BECAUSE UNDER OUR EXISTING STATE LAW THIS IS A RIGHT. EACH AND EVERYONE OF US HALF EVERY OTHER STUDENT HAS IN EVERY CALIFORNIAN HOUSE AND THE ONLY REASON THAT OUR STUDENT ATHLETES DO NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IS BECAUSE THEY SIGN A WAIVER TO THE NC TWO EIGHT GIVING IT UP. SO BY THE END TWO ETS PHONE BY LAW AS IT STATES THAT STUDENT ATHLETES MUST BE TREATED COMPARABLY TO ALL OTHER STUDENTS IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THIS IS A RIGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE. THEIR HANDS THE NC TO A BY LAWS INDICATE THAT THE NC TO A WILL FOLLOW STATE LAW. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE HAD MANY LEGAL OPINIONS THAT THE NC TWO EIGHT CANNOT RETALIATE AGAINST CALIFORNIA THAT TO DO SO. WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF ANTI TRUST WE CAN AND SHOULD PASS SB TWO OH SIX. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I'M HONORED TO JOIN ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY OBSTACLE AUTHOR OF SB TOOL SIX AND THAT'S CLEARLY STATED IS TRULY THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF TODAY THE STUDENT ATHLETES HAVE BEEN TREATED LIKE CATTLE FOR YEARS THEIR WORKERS DESPITE BEING ATHLETES THEY ARE WORKERS AND I SHOULD SAY TO SUB SPITE MEANS STUDENTS. THEIR WORKERS EARNING MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS FOR UNIVERSITIES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND THEY'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO BENEFIT OFFER THEIR NAME IMAGE OR LIKENESS AND AS STATED THERE NOW COLLEGE COACHES MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING ABLE TO MONETIZE THEIR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS AND MANY TIMES A UNIVERSITIES REPUTATION IS. BASED MORE SO ON ITS ATHLETIC. PROWESS STAND ON IT'S ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. IN MANY CASES SO THIS HELPS BUILD A LORE AND ATTENTION AND RECRUITMENT FOR OTHER STUDENTS WHO WANT TO COME TO THE UNIVERSITIES AT FIND THEMSELVES. ACHIEVING GREAT ACADEMIC MEAN ATHLETIC CHAMPIONSHIPS. ARE IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THAT THE NCAA DID AWAY WITH THE LIMITS ON FOOD IT WAS NOT UNTIL A CONNECTICUT BASKETBALL STAR SHOULD BOGGS NAY PEER WHOSE PLANE IN THE IN SITU ACE FINAL FOR. ANY STATED MANY NIGHTS I GO TO BED HUNGRY SO MANY TIMES JUST BECAUSE A ATHLETE HAS A SCHOLARSHIP DOES IT MEAN THAT ALL OF THEIR NEEDS ARE TAKEN CARE OF A JOB THE SURVIVING COLLEGE TODAY REQUIRES MORE THAN TUITION AND BOOKS AND BOARD SO. MANY HAVE EVEN COMPLAINED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHEN THEY A KID FROM THE WEST COAST GO BACK KEYS THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A OVER COAT TO WEAR SO THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY IT'S ABOUT FAIRNESS. AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. AS I STATED THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE DESPITE FROM THE FOLKS WHO WERE IN THIS BUILDING THIS WEEK. COMPLAIN ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES THIS IS A REAL ONE THAT WE CAN ALL GET ON BOARD CONSERVE OUR PLANET PORT THAT YOU LOVE COULD NOT BE A SENTENCE THAT REQUIRES YOU TO RELINQUISH THIS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. HERE EARNING INCOME OUR STANDARD BEARER OF AMATEURISM IS OUR OLYMPIC ATHLETES AND NAY TODAY OR ALLOW THE MONETIZE. THEIR NAME LIKENESS IN IMAGE AND I THINK THESE ATHLETES SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN LESS THAN 3% OF THESE ATHLETES MAKE UP ARE YOU COULD SAY. 3% STUDENT POPULAR BUT THESE AFTER AMERICAN ATHLETES MAKE UP OVER 50% OF OUR FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL TEAM. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND IT'S TIME THAT WE WRITE THIS HISTORIC WRONG SB TOOLS SIX IS THAT FIRST STEP PLEASE JOIN LEBRON JAMES KEVIN DURANT AND MANY OTHER ALL WELL KNOWN ATHLETES IN SUPPORTING SB TWO OH SIX I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER PRESIDENT I JUST WANTED TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK WE HAD A BILL ON THE FLOOR THE OTHER DAY TALKING ABOUT ALLOWING YOUNG PEOPLE TO VOTE BEING GAVE CIVIC LEE I WAS SO IMPRESSED WHEN I GOT A TEXT FROM A SOPHOMORE FOOTBALL PLAYER AT LONG BEACH POLY HIGH SCHOOL AUSTIN GRIFFIN. WHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM MY ALAMEDA SAID THE FOLLOWING THE HE WANTED TO EXPRESS HIS SUPPORT BECAUSE AS THE ATHLETE HE KNOWS HOW HARD IT IS TO PLAYING KEEP YOUR GRADES UP. AND HE SAID IT WOULD HELP SO MANY STRUGGLING IN COLLEGE EAT WHILE THE SCHOOLS MAKE SO MUCH MONEY AND THAT HE WANTED ME TO SUPPORT IT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WE DO THEY SEE THEMSELVES IN THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE ATHLETES AND THEY UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ON THE NEWS ON TV THAT THERE ARE A LEAD ATHLETES THAT THEY TO STRUGGLING PLEDGE ANYWAY BUT ME TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND ON. TOP OF ALL NOW THE CENTER. THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL CENTER URGES. THIS I KIND OF WISH THIS ISSUE EXISTED BACK IN MY COLLEGE DAYS WHEN I USED TO PLAY TENNIS AND THIS WOULD BEEN TERRIBLY CONVENIENT BUT I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO POSE A QUESTION IF I CAN'T TO THE FLOOR MANAGER JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. WELL ACTUALLY THE AUTHOR BUT YET WITH THE AUTHOR EXCUSE ARE ARE YOU RULING DID I'M WILLING TO YES. OF MY LARGE IS DATED. THERE USED TO BE A TIME WHEN. TO GET INTO THE OLYMPICS YOU HAD TO BE AN AMATEUR AND THE DEFINITION OF AMATEURS THAT YOU DID NOT PROFIT FROM THE THAT THE SPORT ITSELF THAT'S CHANGED A LITTLE BIT BUT IS THAT STILL THE RULE. THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF. NO IT IS NO LONGER OLIMPIC ATHLETES HAVE THE RIGHT TO THEIR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS. TAKE IT INTO THE OLYMPICS TO QUALIFY. NO OKAY IS NO LONGER. WHAT IS STILL A QUALIFICATION THOUGH HOWEVER. IF YOU'RE IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH IS NOT A DIVISION ONE OR TWO SPORTS SO THAT'S NOT UNDER IN C. TO A RULES. AND LET'S SAY. YOU YOU WERE THE STAR PLAYER YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND YOU MONETIZE YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEOS YOU WERE YOU KNOW SO FOLLOWED IN YUMA YOU WOULD THEN BE EXCLUDED. FROM PARTICIPATING IN A DIVISION ONE OR TWO COLLEGE SPORT ACTIVITY BECAUSE YOU HAD DONE THAT PRIOR. SO THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE A YOUNG WOMAN IN CALIFORNIA SHE'S IN. MIDDLE NOT MIDDLE SCHOOL BUT BREAKING FOR HIGH SCHOOL SHE'S A BRILLIANT SOCCER PLAYER AND SHE IS SO FOLLOWED WORLDWIDE. AARON'S OPTED FOR HER NOT TO GO TO COLLEGE AS A SOCCER PLAYER TO BEGIN TO TAKE ENDORSEMENTS NOW BECAUSE THEY KNEW EVEN AS AN EIGHTH GRADER IF SHE TOOK INDOORS MEN'S THAT YOU WOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM BEING ABLE TO BE. ON A COLLEGE TEAM. CRAZY I'M TOWARD ON THIS BECAUSE ONE I THINK THIS IS A CONTRACT RIGHT. THAT IS AT ISSUE HERE FOR SOMEONE TO BE TOLD THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR LIKENESS. IN THE COURSE OF THEIR THERE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE JUST DOESN'T SEEM FAIR WHEN EVERYONE ELSE SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CONTRACT RIGHT. IN THAT'S BUT MY ON THE FLIP SIDE I'M WONDERING. ARE WE CONCERNED AT ALL IN DURING THE COURSE OF DRAFTING THIS LEGISLATION WERE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL THAT. THE INDUSTRIES AND ALL THE RELATED DOLLARS THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY THIS IS GOING TO UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SCHOLASTIC EXPERIENCE THE EMPHASIS ON. UNIVERSITIES ACTUALLY BEING SCHOLASTICALLY ORIENTED BECAUSE IT IT'S GONE SO FAR THE OTHER DIRECTION THAT. I'VE I FEEL WE'VE BEEN LOSING THAT WE'VE BEEN LOSING THAT SCHOLASTIC EXPERIENCE FOR THE SAKE OF THE DOLLARS THAT COME ALONG WITH THE- WITH THAT WITH THE RIGHT WITH THAT'S LETTER DASH THROUGH THE CHAIR. CENTER SKINNER YOU THANK YOU RECENTLY I'M- HEY ONE COULD ALWAYS DEBATE THAT BUT CERTAINLY NOW THERE'S NO PROHIBITION ON ANY OTHER STUDENTS TO BEING ENTREPRENEURIAL IF WE LOOK AT MARK ZUCKERBERG HE STARTED FACEBOOK AS A COLLEGE STUDENT NOW HE DIDN'T FULLY MONETIZE ITALY AFTER YOU LEFT COLLEGE BUT HAD HE BEEN ABLE TO THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROHIBITION. AND I BELIEVE HE WAS A COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJOR SO HE COULD HAVE USED HIS A SKILL THAT A SKILL HE FURTHERED AS A COLLEGE STUDENT MONETIZED AND OF NO PROBLEM SO. ARE WE DON'T APPLY THAT STANDARD TO ANY OTHER STUDENT ADDITIONALLY WITH IN IF WE LOOK AT THE COLLEGE SPORTS INDUSTRY. THERE IS. CORRUPTION BECAUSE WE DON'T ALLOW THIS INSTEAD THERE IS UNDER HE TABLE HEY OUT EITHER BY COLLEGE COACHES DIRECTLY TO PLAYERS OR TO OTHERS THEN THE FBI INVESTIGATES AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THE PLAYER THEMSELVES SUFFERS THE PLAYER THEMSELVES IS THEN EXCLUDED FROM THE SPORT. IF WE DO THIS IF WE. ALL THIS ABOVE GROUND AND GIVE THE STUDENT THE RIGHT WE WILL AVOID THAT ADDITIONALLY YOU HAVE SITUATIONS LIKE DIANE WILLIAMSON WHO. QUIT SCHOOL DID NOT FINISH SCHOOL BECAUSE IT WHERE THERE WAS NO LUCRATIVE REASON TO STAY IN SCHOOL PERHAPS SOME ATHLETES WOULD FINISH THEIR COLLEGE DEGREE BEFORE THEY WENT PRO IF WE ALLOWED THIS. ARE ALL WELL IN MY COMMENTS HERE MISTER PRESIDENT. THIS WAS IT IS A VERY TOUGH ISSUE. SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT I WILL BE SUPPORTIVE I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT IN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS. IF IT DOES CHANGE THE CULTURE. THANK YOU SIR BOARD JUST SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BECAUSE I HAVE. OF SOMEONE VERY DEAR TO ME WHO PLAYED ON THE USC FOOTBALL TEAM MY OLDEST SON BOBBY ARCHULETA AND HE PLAYED WITH BROAD THE PETE AND THEY SHARED BLOCKER SIDE BY SIDE SO I'M VERY PROUD OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENT ANY WORSE IS ROSE BOWL RING VERY PROUDLY AS A U. S. C. TROJANS. AND HE TOLD ME STORIES THAT WAY BACK WHEN HOW SOME OF THE KIDS ON THAT FOOTBALL TEAM HAD TO ASK OTHER KIDS WITHIN THE STUDENT BODY FOR EXTRA DIMES NICKELS A COUPLE DOLLARS HERE AND THERE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD THAT LUNCH THAT WAS NEEDED AT THE OUTSIDE CAFETERIA. THAT THE FACT THAT IF THEIR AUTOMOBILE BROKE DOWN THEY COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF IT BY ASKING SOMEONE ELSE PICK THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE NCAA RULING. AND SO THIS IS EXPLOITATION AT ITS FULLEST AND I THINK THAT NOW THAT THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S BEEN RECOGNIZED ACROSS THE NATION EVERYONE IS SAYING OH MY GOD WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DOING WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING MAKING SURE THAT THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND IT'S A DEADLY SENATORS. NOT EVERY SINGLE ATHLETE IS GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT HAS TO DO WITH THEIR ABILITIES AND THEIR STATUS TO BE THE FIRST PART BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE BUT HOPE WE THEY'LL STE THE WELL TWO POINT THAT KIDS WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE NOT ONLY THE EDUCATION BUT THE NOURISHMENT THAT THEY NEED EVERY SINGLE BIT COMPETE. SO I'M THINKING THAT CALIFORNIA BEN IS LEAVE THE WAY AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE DOORS IT'S KIDS THAT NEED OUR HELP THANK YOU. TONIGHT URGENT BY BOAT THANK YOU SAID ARE SHOULD LET US CENTER JONES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I CAME TO THE- FLOOR TODAY PRETTY SURE OF MY OPPOSITION THIS BILL BUT THE DEBATE HAS CAUSE ME TO READ MY SHIN. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR QUESTION FOR CLARIFICATION. ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE PLEASE. YOU WILL YOU TAKE A CORTES INTERJECT QUICKLY NC DOUBLE A AS I UNDERSTAND IT HAS WRITTEN A LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A TH IF YOU WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT AS A THREAT TO HER. POLICY POSITION ON THERE OR OF A POSITION ON THEIR END IT. IF THIS DOES PASS THAT THEY WILL NOT ALOW CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN POSTSEASON. NC DOUBLE A TOURNAMENT'S. WHICH IS REALLY THE SOURCE OF MY- OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BUT WHAT CAUSES ME TO ASK THE QUESTION AND- CAN BECOME MORE OPEN MINDED TO HIS FORBES DID A VERY GOOD ARTICLE ON IT LAST WEEK. AND HAD PRESENTED SOME PRETTY GOOD INFORMATION BUT I WOULD SINCE I WASN'T A PART OF THE HEARINGS. OR THAT LETTER I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR OF POSSIBLE ON THAT PLEASE. THANK YOU SO THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER THE NC TWO EIGHT CAN MAKE GOOD ON THE THREATS THAT THEY ARE MAKING. Z. MANY LAWYERS INCLUDING ONE A LAWYER WHO WROTE IN A FORBES ARTICLE. AND WE HAVE NUMEROUS OTHER LAWYERS WHO'VE NOW OPINED EITHER IN A FORBES ARTICLE IN THERE'S AN ONLINE PUBLICATION CALLED THE ATHLETE OR THE ATHLETIC THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHERS DIFFERENT LAWYERS ALL HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS BILL AND OF ALL EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT. IF THE NC TWO EIGHT TRIES. ON THEIR THREAT. THAT WERE FIRST THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BECAUSE- IT IS AN ANTITRUST VIOLATION THAT IS THE LEGAL OPINION. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THE NC TWO WAY ON THE THEORY OF VIOLATION OF ANTI TRUST. THEIR RECORD WELL LET'S SEE THE RECORD OF WINNING IS PRETTY LOW THEY HAVE LOST ALMOST EVERY LAWSUIT BROUGHT AGAINST THEM IN A QUESTION OF ANTI TRUST. SO THE LEGAL OPINIONS THAT BOTH WE HAVE REQUESTED AND THAT AVE JUST VOLUNTARILY BEEN EXPRESSING THEMSELVES WITHIN THE PRESS ARE ALL THAT THE AND SEE TO IT THAT THIS IS A HOLLOW THREAT. THAT THIS IS TO SCARE US NOTICE THAT THE NCAA DID NOT SAY THEY WOULD. HIT COLLEGE. CALIFORNIA COLLEGES FROM PARTICIPATING AT ALL RIGHT THEY WIN AT THE HEART OF THE THING IF I'M A STUDENT pATHLETE WHAT TWENTY MOST WANT. THE CHAMPIONSHIPS THE PLAYOFFS SO OF COURSE THAT IS THE MOST PERMITTED BOTH THREAT. BUT I THINK IT'S A HOLLOW THREAT THANK YOU BACK AMOUNT TIMES A PRESIDENT THANK YOU MISS CAN APPRECIATE AND A VERY GOOD EXPLANATION. I WILL IT. THE VOLTS TO THE BODY HERE THAT I DID HAVE A VERY POWERFUL LOBBYISTS CONTACT ME ON THIS BILL. MY YOUNGEST SON. WHO PLAYS A COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL AND SO I HE'S I DON'T I MEAN HOPEFULLY SOME DAY HE'S IN THE ARENA OF BEING A- QUALIFIED FOR THIS I DON'T THINK HE IS RIGHT NOW BUT HE'S GOT OVER WORK TO DO. BUT HOPEFULLY IS LISTENING. I APPRECIATE TO SEND ARSENAL AT HIS COMMENTS ON THIS AS WELL THAT. AND BASED ON THOSE YEAH I'M GONNA VOTE I TODAY AND KIND OF SEE HOW THOSE AND LET'S SEE HOW THIS WORKS OUT I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THIS KIND OF CHANGE I THINK THAT. A LOT OF THE POINTS HAVE BEEN POIGNANT TODAY AND SO WITH THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING SB TWO OH SIX THANK YOU CENTER JONES SENATOR DALLY. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS REAL QUICK I JUST WANNA SAY LOOK THIS IS BIG BUSINESS. THESE COLLEGES ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THE STUDENTS AT THEIR PERIL. SO IF YOU'RE ON OUR SIDE ALLEN YOU YOU TECH ABOUT FREE ENTERPRISE WHY NOT ALLOW THEM TO HOW MANY OF THEM ARE IT IT'S A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. SOME OF THEM DON'T EVER MAKE IT TO THE PROS AND THEY GET HURT. AND THEY MISSED OUT ON THAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAYBE GET SOME RESOURCES ALONG THE WAY I THINK THIS IS A OF YOU KNOW FREEDOM OF ENTERPRISES THIS IS A NO BRAINER FOR ME. DEFINITELY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HOPE THAT THEY GET TO USE IT AND THEY YOU KNOW MAKE SOME RESOURCES AND GROW THEIR BUSINESS THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS I LOOK AT THIS A GOODBUSINESS BUSINESS DECISION. AND NOW I THINK WE ALL SHOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR DALLY. BETTER MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT JUST ONE LAST POINT IT HIT ME AS I LISTEN TO LAST WEEK YOU KNOW THIS IS ALSO A GENDER PARITY ISSUE. I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH THE MILLERS. IN RIVERSIDE SHERILYN REGGIE. AND YOU KNOW THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS LOVE YOU READ YOU SURE I WAS A BETTER BALL PLAYER IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT THE WNBA DIDN'T EXIST THEN IN THE WOMEN IN THE WNBA DON'T MAKE. ANY DON'T MAKE A DIME ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED TO THAT MAN IN THE NBA. ALSO CHERYL IN COLLEGE AT USC HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS. SHE WOULD HAVE BENEFITTED FROM HER INNATE AMAZING GOD GIVEN TALENT. HER BROTHER DID HAD A FULL CAREER IN THE NBA AND CHERYL WAS NOT ABLE TO DO THIS SO THIS IS ALSO A GENDER PARITY ISSUE. FOR WOMEN ATHLETES AT THE COLLEGIATE LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO. ON BENEFIT FINANCIALLY WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS. TO GO ON INTO PROFESSIONAL ATHLETICS ANOTHER REASON TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL STONE WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT IN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE. THIS IS THE KIND OF DEBATES THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE. CORDIAL FOUGHT FULL WITH GOOD BACKGROUNDS AND TRY TO. REACH A CONSENSUS. YOU KNOW I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO EDUCATE OUR KIDS WE NEED TO HAVE A GREAT EDUCATED WORK FORCE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR GOING TO COMPETE GLOBALLY. BUT I AM REMINDED OF A STORY AS I'M AS I'M SITTING HERE IN HER TESTIMONY VOTED NO ON THIS ONE ORIGINALLY CAME BEFORE US. AND I HEARD OF A STORY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN THAT. WAS PLAYING FOOTBALL AND- HE GOT OFFERED A PRETTY A PRETTY NICE CHECK. TO GO RIGHT AWAY BEFORE HE GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE TO GO TO A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM. AND HIS MOTHER SAID NO YOU'RE GOING TO FINISH YOUR SCHOOL. BEFORE YOU GO ON TO THE PROS. AND ENDED UP GETTING A HORRIFIC INJURY. THAT COMPLETELY DECIMATED HIS FOOTBALL CAREER. SO I'M LOOKING AT THIS FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE NOW I'M THINKING THAT MAYBE IF WE ALLOW SOME OF THESE ATHLETES ARE REALLY HAVE STRONG PROMISE TO BECOME PROFESSIONALS. MAYBE WITH SOME OF THE INCOME THAT THEY CAN GET DURING THEIR FORMIDABLE YEARS IN COLLEGE THAT THEY WILL SEE THE BENEFITS OF COMPLETING THEIR EDUCATION WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. CAN IN THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION AND THEY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND MAYBE EVEN DO VERY WELL WITH THEIR TALENTS. BUT LASTLY I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I'M VERY PROUD OF MY DAUGHTER I HAVE A DAUGHTER ONE DAUGHTER THREE SONS AND. MY DAUGHTER CAME TO ME WHEN. SHE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AND SHE WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN SCHOLASTIC SPORTS AT ALL. AND SHE GOES DOWN I'M GONNA TRY OUT FOR WATER POLO. I SAID BERNIE THAT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA I THINK YOU SHOULD DO THAT IT'S A GREAT SPORT. BUT SHE CALLED ME BACK AND SHE GOES. I REALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS FOR ME THAT I THINK I'M GOING TO QUIT I SAID. DON'T DON'T QUIT WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT SHE GOES WELL I THOUGHT THAT. WATER POLO WAS VOLLEY BALL IN THE WATER. I SAID NO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE PHYSICAL THAN THAT BUT YOU SIGNED UP FOR IT. AND YOU NEED TO STAY IN THE SPORT. REASON WHY I MENTION THIS IS BECAUSE SHE DID VERY WELL IN WATER POLO IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT SHE WAS AT LEAST SO VEHICLE. HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEN SHE APPLIED TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO. AND SHE WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT HER VERY HIGH GPA WASN'T FOUR POINT OH FIVE AND SHE DIDN'T THINK THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GET IN. BUT OUR COACH SAID HEY YOU HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT PLAYING WATER POLO. AND SHE GOES NO SHOES GO TALK TO THE COACH. SO SHE WENT TO THE COACH AND THE COACH DOESN'T WANT TO HER ON MONDAY MORNING COMING YOUR BREATHING SUIT. WE WERE TO GO ON THE WATER SEVEN THIRTY THE MORNING MY DAUGHTER SHOWS UP. HE THROWS THE BALL. THE COACHES THREW THE BALL IN THE NET. MY DAUGHTER IS A SOUTH PAW A LEFTY SHE TAKES THE BALL SHE THROWS A THAN THAT HE THROWS OR ANOTHER BALL SHE THROWS IT INTO THE NET HE THROWS ANOTHER VOICE SHOWS THE NET AGAIN. BECAUSE GET OUT. HE GOES COULD YOU BE HERE MONDAY MORNING A STARK HE GOES WELL I HAVEN'T BEEN ADMITTED TO THE COLLEGE CHAU SIR HE SAYS ONE ALLOWED TO ACCEPT ONE STUDENT PER YEAR. AND I'M ACCEPTING YOU. SHE PLAYED ALL FOUR YEARS AT UCSC. AND LET ME TELL YOU IT WAS A STRUGGLE. I MEAN SHE'S FORTUNATE SHE HAD A BAD THE COULD AFFORD TO PUT HER THROUGH SCHOOL. BUT SHE HAD A LOT OF COLLEAGUES THAT WERE PLAYING WATER POLO. THERE REALLY STRUGGLED TO MAKE IT THROUGH. AND SO THE TESTIMONY THAT I'VE HEARD HERE TODAY. HI IS CHANGING MY MIND ON THIS VOTE. AND AGAIN CALIFORNIA SOMETIMES JUST HAS TO LEAD THE WAY. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO BLAZE A TRAIL. FOR THOSE REASONS I'M GONNA SUPPORT SB TO A SIX. THANK YOU CENTER STONE CENTER NIELSEN. MISTER PRESIDENT LEADING DOWN THE SENATE THIS IS KIND OF A RARE EXPERIENCE FOR ME BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS SAID VERY SELDOM DO THIS DEBATE ON THE FOREVER CHANGE ANY MINDS. EVEN MY OWN. I CAME HERE TODAY QUITE OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION. AND I THINK WE HAD IT ONCE BEFORE BEFORE XIN I DID VOTE NO. THAT ARE LISTENING TO THE DEBATE I REALIZED SOMETHING. NOW I WAS A SCHOLARSHIP ATHLETE BUT I WAS NEVER ANYBODY GOING TO PAY ME FOR ANYTHING AT ALL. TO ENDORSE. BUT WHAT I GAINED FROM ATHLETICS. TO THE KIND OF HUMAN BEING THAT I AM. HAS MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE SUCCESS. I HAVE IN MY OFFICE COUPLE FOOTBALLS IN MY COLLEGE SHOT PUT AND DISCUS AND A SIGN IN FRONT OF A THAT SAYS HEAVY LIFTING. AND HEAVY LIFTING THEN WAS BEING IN SHAPE FOR SPORTS NIGHT AND COMPETED IN TRACK A LITTLE BIT AS A MASTER LATER. AND FOOTBALL AND WORKING ON THE FARM THAT WAS A HEAVY LIFTING. BUT NOW THE HEAVY LIFTING IS ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE DO HERE. AND THE GREATEST THING I LEARNED IN ATHLETICS WAS DISAPPOINTING. WELL WHAT OF THAT THAT KIND OF PUT IT IN CONTEXT HERE FOR ME TODAY. BECAUSE I WAS ENVISIONING THESE LEGIONS OF AGENTS. SPORTS AGENTS DESCENDING OUR UNIVERSITIES. AND THEY'RE NOT ALL THE MOST ETHICAL PEOPLE. BUT THE POINT THAT I MAKE. THE GOOD ATHLETES. OR ANYONE WHO EVEN COMPETES IN ATHLETICS EVEN. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WHATEVER. IT DOES SOMETHING POSITIVE I BELIEVE TO THE HUMAN BEING THE HUMAN CHARACTER IN THE HUMAN SOUL. AND SO IF SOMEONE IT IS SO GOOD. THE DAVID DEVELOPED AN ECONOMIC PRESENCE AND POTENTIAL. BUT MAYBE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AND NOW RATHER THAN BEING A VERY STRONG NO VOTE. I TO WILL BE AND I WILL. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. CENTER JACKSON YES I FEEL COMPELLED TO STAND UP BUT IT IS RESULT OF THE COMMENTS BY MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING A HISTORY OF MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF RECOGNIZING RESPECTING STUDENT ATHLETES. AS A YOUNG WOMAN BELIEVE IT OR NOT I WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD TENNIS PLAYER BUT I WAS INELIGIBLE FOR SCHOLARSHIPS TO COLLEGE BECAUSE SITTING GIVE SCHOLARSHIPS TO. GIRLS TO PLAY. FOURTEEN COLLEGE THAT OF COURSE IS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY AND AS A RESULT WE NOW HAVE COLLEGE. SCHOLARSHIPS FOR WOMEN IN SPORTS WE HAVE WOMEN WHO ARE LEADING THE UNITED STATES IN GOLD MEDALS AT THE OLYMPICS BECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING AT IT OR CERTAINLY NOT HAVING TO GO OUT. AND DRIVE IN UBER IN THE EVENING AFTER THEY WORK OUT AND TRY VERY HARD TO EXCEL AND TO AND TO LIVE UP TO THEIR- ATHLETIC EXPECTATIONS SO WE'RE SEEING MOVEMENT IN THAT DIRECTION. AND I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXTRAORDINARY TALENT CANNOT DO IT ON THEIR OWN. I ALSO HAVE A GRANDSON WHO IS SIX FOOT SEVEN AND IS. FOR GORE DEPENDING AT A UNIVERSITY AND WE WENT TO THE NC TO ACE LAST YEAR IS A STARTING PLAYER HE HAS A FOUR YEAR SCHOLARSHIP TO COLLEGE. BUT THAT ISN'T ENOUGH. WE END UP HAVING TO SEND THE MONEY EVERY NOW AND THEN HE WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY WELL. THERE'S A LITTLE HAMBURGER STORE AROUND THE CORNER I COULD SURE USE SOME MONEY. BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THOSE BURGERS AFTER A FOUR HOUR WORK OUT WHEN I'VE LOST FIVE TO TEN POUNDS. NOT COMPLAINING. BUT THIS IS THE REALITY THIS IS THIS IS THE KIND OF THING WE NEED TO REINFORCE AND SUPPORT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ACHIEVING EXCELLENCE. WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO GO THROUGH COLLEGE AND I WILL TELL YOU BEING AN ATHLETE AND A STUDENTATHLETE AND DOING WELL IN SCHOOL AND DOING BOTH IS NOT AN EASY TASK. THE NOTION THAT THEY COULD DÃ¢N WE ACTUALLY WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY LÃ . WHILE IN SCHOOL I IS NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY REACH AND BE FOR THOSE THREES THE FACT THAT. WHEN YOU SAW. AFTER THE WINTER. I'LL BE ABLE TO GET SOME MONEY AS THEY DO. THEIR WORK AND AS STATED SHE THOSE EXCELLENT GOAL. NOW ALL BEING THIS UP I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT IF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DOESN'T FOLLOW SUIT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME GREAT ATHLETIC TEAMS HERE BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE. BOOKS ARE GONNA WANT TO COME TO SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR THAT IN A NOT A BUNCH OF OTHER REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON. THERE SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU. IN MY CLOSE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO INTERFERE WITH THE RIGHT OF OUR COLLEGE PROGRAMS TO GENERATE MONEY FOR THEIR ATHLETICS PROGRAMS IT IS NOT IN ANY WAY DESIGNED FOR THATIT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE COLLEGES TO PAY THE ATHLETES AND IN FACT THE REASON IT'S COMING BACK FOR CONCURRENCE IS BECAUSE THE BILL WAS AMENDED THE ASSEMBLY. AND THE AMENDMENT THAT WILL BE ADDED WHAT IS THAT ANY CONTRACT ENDORSEMENTS SPONSORSHIP THAT IN STUDENTS PURSUED COULD NOT BE IN CONFLICT WITH A CONTRACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAD FOR THEIR SPORTS PROGRAM OR AT TEAM SO IT JUST WANTED TO. BE CLEAR AND LAID BACK TO REST AND THEN TO FINALLY SAY THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AN ELITE ATHLETE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS WE HAD I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM HEALDSBURG BROUGHT TO US ON THE FLOOR. FOR MONTHS AGO A YOUNG WOMAN FROM LAKE COUNTY WHO HAD WON THE CHAMPIONSHIPS STATEWIDE FOR HIGH SCHOOL IN WRESTLING AND WAS THE FIRST TIME ANY ATHLETE FROM LAKE COUNTY HAD ACCOMPLISHED SUCH A FEAT NOW ASSUMING THAT SHE WILL STEP BACK. THAT YOUNG WOMAN IS JUST THE PRIDE OF LAKE COUNTY YOU COULD SEE THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE WHEN SHE CAME TO GET THAT RECOGNITION THEY'RE SO PROUD OF HER YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE IN OUR CAR DEALERSHIPS ROTARY CLUBS YOU NAME IT THAT WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SPONSOR HER IF SHE WANTED TO GO ON TO WRESTLING AT A COLLEGE AN NC TO A COLLEGE. SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT THAT WHEN I HIGHLY DOUBT I'M SURE THERE'S A FEW A FEW WOMEN WRESTLERS THAT GET A SCHOLARSHIP IN COLLEGE BUT IT'S PRETTY RARE SO IT IS FOR ATHLETES LIKE HER AND EVERY OTHER ATHLETE THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS AND IF I CAN CLOSE AND REFERENCE OF MY OWN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE FAVORITE ATHLETE. THE FORMER UCLA PLAYER KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR JUST AS WITH EVERY INJUSTICE WRONGS DON'T GET RIGHTED UNLESS WE KEEP RAISING OUR VOICES AGAIN. AND AGAIN WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

I SHOULD THESE HEAVY OILS IS NON POLLUTING OIL SPILL THEY MAY BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN UP. BECAUSE THEY DON'T FLOAT ON THE SURFACE THEY GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER WAY. AND THEY ARE PERMANENTLY LODGED IN THE UNDERWATER ENVIRONMENT. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR WILDLIFE TOURISM FISHING AND PUBLIC HEALTH.

ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN OH SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH AN ACT RELATED CHARGES SCHOOLS THERE LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD EVENING MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY STATING THAT RECENT AMENDMENTS INCLUDE NEGOTIATED AMENDMENTS THAT MAKE THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL AB FIFTY NO SEVEN CONTINUES THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE'S WORK IN INCREASING CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY. BY ELIMINATING LOOPHOLES IN CURRENT LAW WHICH ALLOW CHARTER SCHOOLS TO OPERATE OUT OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THEIR AUTHORIZING DISTRICT THIS BILL RESTORES THE RIGHT OF OVERSIGHT OVER THE SCHOOLS LOCATED WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES AND CLARIFIES THE JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. OF THE DULY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS AND THEIR ROLE IN PUBLIC OVERSIGHT AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN SIX TO ADDRESS CONSISTENT AN ONGOING CHALLENGES THAT LEAVE IMPACTED DISTRICTS WITH NO RECOURSE OTHER THAN COSTLY LITIGATION LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS ELLIE ETS ARE TASKED WITH ENSURING STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT THAT SUCCESS IS BUILT OFF OF A TRUST FROM THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE ELEAZAR AND THE COMMUNITY THAT IS IMPACTED BY THE ELLIE ETS. TRUST IS BUILT OFF OF MEASURES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT WHICH IS NOT PRACTICE SYBIL IF ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE SCHOOL IN YOUR BACKYARD AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HAVE TOOLS AND THE POWER TO BEST USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND CHILDREN AND FOR THOSE LOCAL ENTITIES TO DO WAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO DO MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR LEYVA ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS AND. I'M SORRY TO SAY AGAIN THAT WE'RE KIND OF BACK IN THE SAME PLACE WHO WERE EARLIER IN THE WEEK AND NOT TALKING ABOUT. CHARTER SCHOOLS VERSUS TALKING ABOUT THE BROADER CHALLENGES FACING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND ONCE AGAIN IT CERTAINLY PUTS ME IN CONFLICT WITH THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE IN OUR SCHOOLS THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE TEACHERS ARE ON THE FRONTLINE OF THAT CHALLENGE. OUR SUPERINTENDENTS OUR PRINCIPLES OUR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. AND IT'S NOT AN EASY CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE. AND YET WE IF IT'S BY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE DO IS A STATE. I STATURE KATE OUR KIDS. AND SO I KNOW IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT JOB AND- CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. WE HAVE SOCIAL ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. THAT THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND I KNOW THAT IF I WERE A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND I HAD SCHOOLS THAT WERE FAILING IN MY DISTRICT. THAT WHEN A GROUP OF PARENTS WOULD COME TO ME AND SAY WE'RE NOT HAPPY THE SCHOOLS NOT WORKING FOR OUR KIDS WE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES THAT I WOULD. I UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT. I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. THAT IT'S A STRESSFUL TIME FOR THEM AND FOR US. BUT I KNOW THAT IT THAT CHARTER SCHOOL WAS FORMED. IT'S GONNA DIMINISH THE RESOURCES THAT I WOULD HAVE IS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. TO HELP THAT THE REST OF THE KIDS. AND THIS IS THE THIS IS THE- THE NATURAL CONFLICT THAT CHARTER SCHOOL EFFORTS. COME INTO PLAY WITH OUR REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IS BECAUSE- BOTH SIDES ARE TRYING TO DO WHAT'S BEST. THOSE PARENTS OF FIVE POTENTIAL CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEN THE SCHOOL BOARDS SUPERINTENDENTS THE TEACHERS ALL THE OTHERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE REGULAR SCHOOL SYSTEM I KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT HAPPY. BUT WHEN THAT CONFLICT OCCURS. THERE IS SELF INTEREST INVOLVED IN THE CHOICE. MEANING THAT. SCHOOL BOARDS ARE NOT INTERESTED. IT FOR A EIGHT AND IN MOST CASES IN AND SUPPORTING. NEW PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS OKAY THAT'S THE CONFLICT AND YET WE HAVE A LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR THESE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS TO BE FORMED. A PROCESS FOR THEM TO FILE APPLICATIONS TO CREATE A SCHOOL. AND SO AND THERE YOU HAVE THE CONFLICT SO. IF THAT CHARTER SCHOOL GETS APPROVED MAYBE NOT BY THAT SCHOOL BOARD MAYBE ITS APPEAL TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF THE STATE BOARD. NOW YOU GET TO THE ISSUE OF WHERE IS THAT CHARTER SCHOOL GOING TO BE LOCATED. AND YOU GET BACK TO THAT CONFLICT AGAIN IF THERE ARE AT THE SCHOOL FACILITIES IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THAT THE COMMUNITY OF PARENTS IN THAT PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL WANT TO USE THAT FACILITY. THERE'S CONFLICT AGAIN BECAUSE THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AGAIN. BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE I DISCUSSED EARLIER. SO WHAT IS THAT NEWLY FORMED CHARTER SCHOOL TO DO WELL THERE. THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE BRINGING IN A PARENT COMMUNITY IN THE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOODS. FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT'S AROUND THAT SCHOOL BUT YET THEY CAN'T USE THAT FACILITY THAT'S NEARBY. BUT YET THEY WANT ONE SO THEY LOOK AROUND THEY TRY TO FIND EMPTY OFFICES OR OTHER FACILITIES TO BEGIN THEIR SCHOOL. AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS THAT THE LOCATION OF THAT SCHOOL GOES OUTSIDE A LINE. A LINE ON A MAP. AND THEIR THEIR VIEW IS I KNOW THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE IT A COMFORTABLE PLACE THEY WANT TO MAKE A CONVENIENT PLACE TO LOOK FOR TRANSIT ROUTES THAT TO LOCATE THAT SCHOOL THEY WANT TO MAKE IT AS CLOSE AS THEY CAN'T FROM THAT COMMUNITY OF PARENTS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT. THAT SCHOOL AREA. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. AND SO YOU HAVE A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL THAT IS OUTSIDE OF A LINE A LINE ON A MAP. AND A BILL LIKE THIS CREATES A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO THE ABILITY. TO HAVE THAT CHARTER SCHOOL FUNCTION BECAUSE THEY NEED A LOCATION WITHIN SIGHT OF A LIE NOT OUTSIDE OF A LINE I THINK ABOUT IT IN YOUR DISTRICT MEMBERS THE LINES THAT ARE ON THE MAP FOR YOU I KNOW IN MY AREA THIS IS GOING TO SURPRISE YOU. BUT THE SENATOR FROM NAPA COUNTY. REPRESENTS AN AREA. THAT THE IN MY DISTRICT. THIRTY FORTY MILES AWAY FROM HIS OFFICE IT'S ONLY ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM MINE BUT IT'S A LINE ON A MAP. HAPPENS TO BE PLEASANT HILL. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE FIND OURSELVES IN. IS IT REASONABLE WELL IT'S WHERE THE LINES ARE DRAWN. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH OUR CITY LINES TO. BUT THOSE PARENTS ARE NOT TRYING TO CREATE A CHARTER SCHOOL IN A PLACES THAT FAR AWAY THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT AS CLOSE AS THEY CAN TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN WHICH THAT CHARTER COMMUNITY WAS BORN. WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR LIFEBLOOD WITH THEIR FRIENDS. AND AT AND THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE LIVING. THIS BILL WOULD TAKE THAT AWAY. YOU KNOW WHEN A. WHEN A PARENT MAKES THE CHOICE TO BE A PART OF IT A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORK IT IS PROBABLY MAYBE THE MOST DIFFICULT CHOICES. THAT THEY MAKE IN THEIR LIVES WHY IS THAT. BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR LIFE. THEIR FRIENDS THERE'S THEIR CHILDREN'S FRIENDS ARE NEARBY AND THEY WANT TO PLAY TOGETHER THEY WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER THEY BREAK THAT UP. AND WHEN THEY HAVE TO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND COME HOME AT NIGHT. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL THEY HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET TO THAT PLACE WHERE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS BEEN FORMULATED BECAUSE THEY- THEY KNOW IT'S THE LIFE BLOOD FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW FOR THEIR- THEIR CHILD'S FUTURE. AND THEY HAVE TO INCONVENIENCE THEIR WHOLE PROFESSIONAL LIFE OR WORK LIFE WHATEVER IT IS. TO MAKE THAT. ATTENDANCE AT THE CHARTER SCHOOL WORK. AND THEN WE HAVE A BILL LIKE THIS IT SAYS. NO NOW. WE'RE WE'RE NOT EVEN ALLOW THAT CHARTER SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S OUTSIDE THAT LINE THAT LITTLE LIGHT ON THE MAP. UNDER LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. AND SO MY FRIENDS. IT IS NOT. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. IT IS NOT FOCUSING ON THE PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION IN OUR STATE. AS I DISCUSSED A FEW DAYS AGO OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FAILING SCHOOLS. TWENTY FIVE OF THEM. CHARTER PUBLIC CHARTERSCHOOLS DO I LIKE THAT NO I DON'T LIKE FEEL THE SCHOOLS ANYWHERE WHAT IT WHATEVER THEY ARE WE OUGHT TO WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE BOATS. BUT THIS THIS THIS LEGISLATION THAT SAYS A LINE ON THE MAP IS GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR PUBLIC CHARTERS ISN'T THE SOLUTION IS NOT GOING TO HELP THEIR PET THAT THESE PARENTS YES. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THE BUT NOW UTILIZED THE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORK. AND WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR CHILDREN. TO BED TONIGHT. WHAT ARE THEY THINKING ABOUT. HELLO MY GET A GET MY KID READY IN THE MORNING HOW MY GONNA GET THEM TO THAT SCHOOL THE SAME THINGS THAT ALL PARENTS THINK ABOUT IT YET IF YOU'RE IN A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL BELIEVE ME YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT TWICE AS HARD BECAUSE IT'S MORE INCONVENIENT. AND THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT THEY'RE MAKING SHOULD WE SUPPORT THAT CHOICE TODAY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SIR GLAZER. SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD BE AS ELOQUENT. AS THE SENATOR FROM ARANDA BUT. AB FIFTY NO SEVEN FOCUSES ON BOUNDARIES. AND WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON STUDENTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON PARENTS WHO WANT THEIR KIDS TO SUCCEED. THE CURRENT SCHOOL. DISTRICT PARADIGM IS SINKING IN SACRAMENTO IS MOVING DECK FURNITURE. I URGE A NO VOTE ON A. B. FIFTEEN OH SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. BIGGEST ARE MORE LIKE CENTER BARGES. TO PRESENT. MY TENURE IN THE SENATE BEGAN AN INTEREST IN JANUARY SO FORGIVE ME IF I'M A LITTLE LATE TO THE PARTY IN UNDERSTANDING HOW ALL OF SACRAMENTO IN THE SENATE WORKS. BUT I THINK WHAT REALLY COME OF WHAT. REALLY IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS DO YOU BELIEVE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE A WORTHWHILE SERVICE. OR DO YOU NOT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION COMES THROUGH IT FALLS INTO TWO CAMPS. MOST OF LEGISLATION THAT WE SEE HAPPENS TO BEING IN THE LATTER. AND IT'S JUST A SYSTEMATIC DELIBERATE DISMANTLING OF THE CHARTER SYSTEM. LEGISLATION BY LEGISLATION ISSUE BY ISSUE CHIPPING AWAY WHEN ULTIMATELY THE ISSUE IS WE JUST DON'T LIKE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THAT I THINK. IS UNFORTUNATE I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO THE MERITS ON THIS I THINK THEY'VE BEEN DISCUSSED BY EARLIER. COMMENTS I JUST THINK IT'S SAD WHEN YOU HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN. AND YOUR TAKING AWAY THAT OPPORTUNITY IN FORCING THEM. ONTO A DIFFERENT PATH WHEN TO CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY EXIST. AND PERFORM WELL THIS IS NOT A WIN LOSE SITUATION OR AN EITHER OR WAR. THEY CAN COEXIST CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN THRIVE CO EXIST WITH THRIVING TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I THINK WE NEED TO RE EVALUATE OUR THESE CHARTER ISSUES NOT JUST ONCE IN THE SESSION BUT THE ONES THAT WILL PROBABLY COME UP IN THE NEXT SESSION. WE CAN FIND PASS FORWARD FOR THEM TO CO EXIST. AND BE MEANINGFUL INSTITUTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES I JUST DON'T THINK WERE. BEING HONEST WITH OURSELVES IF WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS LEGISLATION BY LEGISLATION. NOT FIXING A PROBLEM ITS DISMANTLING CHARTER SYSTEMS. THANK YOU CENTER BOARD JUST SENATOR FELL. WELL AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS HERE AND TWENTY SIX YEARS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE. LEGISLATION THAT REALLY CLARIFIES RELATIONSHIP IF. I'M GONNA TRY TO TAKE YOUR CHEESE AWAY OR IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO TAKE MY CHEESE AWAY SO THIS RELATIONSHIP INTER GOVERNMENTAL RELIGION SHOULD BE ISSUE IS REALLY UNIMPORTANT IMPORTANT THING AND I AND I STAND FOR THIS BILL. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ESTABLISH THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO HAVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE ONE THAT HAS THE SITE. HOUSE TO HAVE THE VOTERS IN THAT DISTRICT. BE THE PREDOMINANT DECISION MAKING BODY. THE PREDOMINANT DECISION MAKING BODY. WITH COOPERATION WITH THE OTHER. SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WORKING WITH THOSE SCHOOL THIS IS THE AND THE CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT I THINK THAT'S A FAIR A FAIR THING BECAUSE WE DID PASS. THE LAW. THAT'S A COMPANION BILL SAYING THAT. WE WENT TO SCHOOL BOARD FROM THAT AREA. TO HAVE THE FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THEY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DETERMINING THE IMPACT. ON ALL THE STUDENTS IN THAT DISTRICT WHAT IS THE ACADEMIC IMPACT WHAT IS THE FISCAL IMPACT NOT JUST FOR THE CHURCH START CHARTER SCHOOL KIDS BUT FOR ALL THE KIDS. IN THE DISTRICT. HOW DOES IT IMPACT YOUR THOSE KIDS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION. HOW DOES IT HELP THE KIDS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION OF THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SO I THINK THIS BILL HELPS FACILITATE THOSE KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS. THAT THOSE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS ARE GOING TO HELP THE STUDENTS NOT HURT. SO. SOMETIMES ANOTHER ANALOGY MIGHT BE IMPORTANT. AND WHAT IF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. WHAT UP TO ANOTHER COUNTY DECIDE WE'RE GOING TO PUT A PRISON UP IN ARANDA. OKAY SAY WE WANTED TO PUT A PRISON ONE OF WE HAVE OUR PRISON INMATES. BEEN FACILITY UP IN THAT ARE AND WE DON'T TALK HAVE TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT. WE CAN GO UP THERE AND DO IT WITHOUT. ANY KIND OF RULES. WE COULD SEE THAT'S A VERY ILLOGICAL SAYING THAT'S WHY YOU NEED. RELATIONSHIPS INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS. TO DEVISE WHAT THE RULES OF THE RULES ARE THIS BILL DOES THAT. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BELL CENTER NIELSEN. MR PRESIDENT LADIES DOWN THE SENATE I. WAS NOT IN A HASTE TO PUT MY MICROPHONE UP I'VE SPOKEN SO OFTEN ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE YEARS. BUT I MUST CONCLUDE THIS WITH THE- THEN OBSERVATION HOW THE ATTACK. BUT I HATE TO USE THAT WORD I WISH YOU COULD BE CONCILIATORY BUT THERE ISN'T OUT OVER AND LONG STANDING ATTACK ON PRIVATE SCHOOL THE CHARTER SCHOOLS EXCUSE ME THE CHARTER SCHOOLS BY SOME ONLY SOME BUT SOME IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL ESTABLISHMENT. AT ALL LEVELS. SUPERINTENDENTS WHO HAVE AN ALL OF LEVEL OF AUTHORITY IN THIS. SCHOOL BOARDS. YES BE A FOR EXAMPLE. CERTAINLY CTA. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AT THE FOR. TO DESTROY. CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE MATURED A BIT. REALIZE THAT THEY HAD TO GET MORE ACTIVE HERE. AND THE POLITICAL PROCESS. THEY LEARNED THAT PROCESS. THEY BECAME SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL. FILL THE PUBLIC SCHOOL NOW ESTABLISHMENT HAS GOT TO DOUBLE DOWN IN FACE OF THIS THREAT. TO THEIR DICTATORSHIP. OF THE EDUCATION. OF OUR YOUTH. I DON'T LIKE TO. SPEAK SO HARSHLY. BUT IT REALLY IS A PAIN TO THE HEART. WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE RESULT IS AND IT IS NOT THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR YOUTH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. ARE NOT ABOUT THE KIDS. NOT ABOUT OUR CHILDREN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION THEY RECEIVE OF THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAIL THEM AND THEIR PARENTS. IT IS ABOUT HAM STRINGING. THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE. THE PUBLIC EDUCATION. MAYBE A TRUCE COULD BE CALLED NOT BE LOVING TO BE A PART OF THAT. TRUCE AND A PEACE DELEGATION. TO PROFESSIONS SOME KIND OF A COMPROMISE HERE. IT WOULD BE TOLERABLE. BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE YET. OF THAT AND I CHARTER SCHOOL ESTABLISHMENT. WANTING TO DO ANYTHING BUT DESTROY. I ORIGINAL WILL. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. SEEING NO OTHER MIKE'S UP THERE LEYVA YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT WELL WE GOT A LITTLE FAR AFIELD ON WHAT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY ABOUT AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES THIS BILL IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL WHICH I THINK MOST OF US ON THIS FLOOR SUPPORT. AND THE LINES THAT ARE DRAWN ARE NOT ARBITRARY LINES THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE LINE THAT OUR PRESIDENT USER SHARPIE AND DREW ON A MAP THESE ARE LINES THAT WERE ACTUALLY DRAWN TO CREATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR THE CITIES THAT WE LIVE IN THEY CEATE THE CITY THAT WE LIVE IN. I LIVE IN THE CITY OF CHINO SO IF MY SCHOOLBOARD VOTES ON THE CHARTER SCHOOL AND THEN LOCATED IN THE CITY OF ONTARIO WHICH IS A CITY THAT ABUTS THE CITY OF CHINO. HOW DOES THE CITY OF ONTARIO SCHOOL BOARD FEEL ABOUT US A SCHOOL THAT THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER BEING IN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT THIS IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL THIS IS NOT ABOUT CLOSING DOWN CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS IS NOT ABOUT NOT ALLOWING THEM TO OPEN THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE IN THE DISTRICT THAT ACTUALLY VOTED FOR THEM.
