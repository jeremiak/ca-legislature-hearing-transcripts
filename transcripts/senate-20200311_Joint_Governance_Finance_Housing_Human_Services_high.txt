I IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL. HOMELESS RESIDENTS BY THE THOUSANDS SLEEP ON OUR STREETS EVERY NIGHT. AND I THINK THAT YOU AGREE WITH THIS IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND IT'S THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS. AS A RESULT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO TAKE BOLD ACTION TO PROVIDE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE. HOUSING SHELTER SERVICES AND PROGRAMMING. IN THIS EFFORT CAN'T BE ONE TIME. IT MUST BE ON GOING. AND WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO BE A PARTNER WITH THE SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE INCIDENT HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING TOGETHER NOW AND IN THE MONTHS TO COME TO BE A TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. CRISIS IN THIS CRISIS I THINK YOU'LL AGREE- TOUCHES THE LIVES OF. SO MANY STATE TAX. HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS FIRMER RURAL COMMUNITIES TO OUR LARGEST CITIES ARE. SLEEPING OUR SIDEWALKS EVERY NIGHT. IT VETERANS INDUSTRY THE RESOURCE OF OUR HEALTH IN SOCIAL SERVICES SYSTEM. AND WHILE THERE IS A THERE MAY NOT BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO SOLVE THE CRISIS. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE STEPPED UP AND THEY'VE CONSTRUCTED HOUSING UNITS EXPANDED SHELTERS AND FOUND. NEW WAYS TO PROVIDE EXPANDED SERVICES TO OUR NEIGHBORS IN. BUT AS WE ARE. AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK IN FRONT OF A- THROUGH THE HEARING THESE COMMITTEES WILL DIG DEEPLY INTO THE CRISIS THE ROLE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO PLAY AND HOW THE STATE CAN PARTNER CAN PARTNER TO HELP TRANSITION INDIVIDUALS OFF THE STREET. AND INTO HOUSING BUT I TO BE A FOCUS ON TODAY'S HEARING FIRST AND FOREMOST THE COMMITTEES RECIEVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE'S RECENT ACTIONS ON THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. SECOND THE COMMITTEES ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM EXPERTS ON THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOW OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES ARE COMBAT IN THE CRISIS. IN HOW WE CAN LEARN FROM THEM. THE THIRD PANEL TODAY IS GONNA HIGHLIGHT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES THAT DAY OF THE FOR THE BEEN THAT THEY'VE DEPLOYED TO CONFRONT HOMELESSNESS. AND TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS WHILE ENCOURAGING. REGIONAL COLLABORATION. FINALLY THE COMMITTEES WILL HEAR FROM PRACTITIONERS AND BEST PRACTICES. ON WHAT HELP THE LEGISLATURE CAN PROVIDE TO ADDRESS THE RANGE OF NEEDS THAT ARE HOMELESS NEIGHBORS NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TODAY IN IN THE MONTHS TO COME TO WORKING WITH EACH OF YOU TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. EACH OF THE CHAIRS AGREED THIS MORNING WHEN WE HAD OUR PRE MEETING THAT WE THAT TO BE A TO DO A SECOND HEARING. IN THE FALL. TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE CAR. CAST KNOWN I WANT TO A- AHEAD OF TIME I'M GONNA HAVE. STEP AWAY TEMPORARY FOR TWO MEETINGS ON HOUSING AND I AGAIN SINCERELY APOLOGIZE BUT I WILL RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I'M NOW GOING TO BE- AT TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO. GERMAN WIENER AND- THAT MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP. THAT WE WORKED A LOT TOGETHER ON ALL ISSUES OF HOUSING AND NOW IT'S HOMELESSNESS IN THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR WOMAN SHOWN HER TITLE. FOR THE HARD WORK AS WELL. AS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND OF COURSE. THE MOST AS- IT IS- HOUSING THIS TOUR AND EXTREMELY LENGTH AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU. ON THIS ISSUE- BUT LOOKING FOR TODAY TODAY'S HEARING I THANK ALL THE- FIVE. BOB PULLED. NEVER THREE TESTIFY TODAY WH THING THAT I WANT A ARE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE I THINK A LOT OF TIMES WHEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT IS WHAT THEY SEE ON THE STREET WHICH IS A- FRANKLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND- THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING IN TENTS OR PEOPLE WHO- ARE EXPERIENCING SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH. OR THE ISSUES- AND THEN THEY HAVE PEOPLE SOMETIMES HAVE A PERCEPTION THE DODD IS WHAT HOMELESSNESS. IS ABOUT I THAT OF COURSE IS. ONLY ONE SEGMENT OF WHAT HOMELESSNESS IS ABOUT- WE KNOW THAT MOST- HOMELESS PEOPLE- ARE NOT MENTALLY ILL- ARE NOT ADDICTED- DAILY- DON'T NECESSARILY NEED SUPPORT OF HOUSING. FIVE DAYS JUST NEED A PLACE. TO LIVE BUT THEY CAN AFFORD- SO THEY'RE NOT LIVING IN A SHELTER LIVING IN A CAR. WE'RE CAL SURFING OR WHATEVER- AND SO WE ALWAYS TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EXPLOSION OF HOMELESSNESS AND THE NUMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS NOT BECAUSE ALL OF THE SUDDEN MORE PEOPLE WERE ADDICTED OR MORE PEOPLE WERE I MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE MORE PEOPLE WORKING ON STABLE IN THEIR LAW. IT'S BECAUSE FOR MORE FORM LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE BEING PRICED OUT OF HOUSING. DOT DOT IS THERE NOT ROCK SCIENCE AND SO THE TRIAGE THAT WE ARE DOING IN THIS YEAR CAN. BE A TRIAGE YES. IS IMPORTANT HELPING PEOPLE GET OFF OF THE STREETS INTO A STABLE SETTING. SHELTER NAVIGATION CENTERS- AND SO FORTH- EXPANDING OUR APPROACH TO MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SO THEY WERE HELPING PEOPLE ALL OF THIS TRIAGE. IS IMPORTANT BUT UNTIL WE SOLVE THE ROOT CAUSE WHICH IS THAT WE FAILED AROUND HOUSING- WE ARE NEVER GOING TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS- AND SO WE CAN'T DO YOU HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM HOUSE. FROM THANK HOUSING PROBLEMS. IT IS ONE AND THE SAME- AND SO WE NEED THE I ONE OF THE THINGS KEEP UP AT NIGHT HI SOMEONE THE BAY AREA. IS THERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LOW WAGE WORKERS IN THE BAY AREA WHO WERE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. BABY HOME WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. ANYWAY FOR THE RETURN. SO WE HAVE A MULTIMILLION. DEFICIT IN CALIFORNIA RANKS. NINE OUT OF FIFTY STATES HOMES FOR UPPER. AND IN THE SIXTY YEAR AS OUR POPULATION IS ALL PULLED ARE OUR HOUSING. ON THE BY THREE QUARTERS. IN THIS ROOM. YEAH WE ARE SELLING A BROKE RECORD BECAUSE I IS ICE DOES ALIVE BUT THE TESTER ARE SO X. AND IT IS ONE OF THE RE WHY PEOPLE ARE TO TWO HOURS TO WORK THAT'S ONE OF THE WHY MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE DOING THINGS LIKE LIVING IN THEIR CARS SO WE HAVE TO VIEW HOMELESSNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF A BROKEN HOUSING SYSTEM NOT ENOUGH HOUSING. NOT ENOUGH INVESTMENT HOUSING SUBSIDIES NOT ENOUGH RENTS ARE PROTECTIONS ALL OF THESE OTHER HOUSING ISSUES ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO HOMELESSNESS THE% OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO TOUCH ON IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE BIG STRUCTURAL ISSUE FOR THE SEGMENT OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION THAT IS SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THAT'S NOT A TINY PORTION IS NOT A MAJORITY BUT SAW TINY PORTION- WE HAVE TO DO MORE AROUND GETTING TO PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION. JUST BEFORE THEY BECOME HOMELESS AND RIGHT NOW OUR SYSTEM IS SET UP SO THAT YOU GET ADDICTION A MENTAL HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY IN CRISIS WE WANTED TO PEOPLE WITH THESE CHALLENGES WALLY STILL HAVE JOB WHILE STILL HAVE A HOME I STILL HAVE A FAMILY AND PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING HOMELESS RIGHT RIGHT GOING TO THAT POINT SO IT'S ABOUT. HOW IT'S ABOUT SHOULD BRING UP OUR PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES IN GETTING THE PEOPLE EARLY AND THEN HOPEFULLY THREE ARE NOT BURKE GOES DOWN BECAUSE THIS JUST BE ABOUT TRIAGE SO AGAIN I EVERYONE LOOK. FORWARD TO HEARING. GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE TO THIS JOINT AND FROM. HEARING I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIRS OF THE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE. AND THE HOUSING COMMITTEE FOR INCLUDING HUMAN SERVICES IN TWO DAYS HEARING. I BELIEVE THAT COLLABORATION BETWEEN THESE VERY DISTINCT POLICY COMMITTEES SIGNALS A RECOGNITION THAT CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS. CRISIS IS MULTI FACETED AND WILL REQUIRE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS THE MULTITUDE OF POLICY AREAS. I BELIEVE THIS IS A HISTORIC EVENT I DON'T THINK THESE THREE COMMITTEES HAVE HELD A HEARING TOGETHER BEFORE TODAY. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A QUICK MOMENT TO WELCOME SENATOR JONES AS A NEW MEMBER OF THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE. AT WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. AS CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES I EAT I AM PLEASED THAT THE PROGRAMS WE OVERSEE ARE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION AND THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL HEAR ABOUT HOW SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. ARE SERVE TO SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE AND HOW LEADERS IN THE HOUSING POLICY- ARE WORKING TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND TODAY WE ARE FOCUSED ON ON AN ISSUE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESSED- AND ON THE TOP OF EVERYONE'S MIND HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT. CALIFORNIA'S BECOME INCREASINGLY UNAFFORDABLE FOR STATES RESIDENTS IN THAT SEVERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IS PUT IS PRETTY MANY AT RISK- OF HOUSING INSTABILITY IN HOMELESSNESS. FOR THE STATE'S LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS A JOB BLOCKS WERE EXPECTED EXPENSE MAY RESULT IN HOMELESSNESS. OFFERED THOSE PEOPLE TO ACCESS THE STATE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THE GAP BETWEEN FEDERAL POVERTY LINE TO COST OF LIVING. COSTS DATE. MAY CONTINUE TO FEEL INSURMOUNTABLE. THAT IS WHY I'M SO THAT WE ARE HERE TO DATE TO REVIEW WHAT THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN BETWEEN WHAT TO COMBAT. PRICES TO OUR BY OUR EXIT IN US. TO HELP YOU. GREEN BEAN HOMELESS. I'D AM FROM THOSE WORKING TO HOME THAT THE A CITY LAW AND TO LOOK TOWARDS WE MIGHT DO BETTER TOGETHER THE FUTURE. WITH AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE DO NOT HAVE TIME TO WAIT WE MUST CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING- HOMELESSNESS AND LOOK FORWARD. TO WAYS TO PREVENT THOSE AT RISK OF FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS WITH FROM DON WITHIN OUR STATE SAFETY NETS. AT THIS MOMENT I REALLY WANT TO- AT THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE TODAY BUT ALSO I LIKE TO CALL UP OUR FIRST PANEL. SO IF WE CAN HAVE. ALEX AND KIM JOHNSON. COME UP PLEASE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW THAT THE DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- MUST BE DONE BY ELEVEN AM BECAUSE SHE HAS OTHER SENATE- BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO INCLUDING HER CONFIRMATION HEARING SENATE RULES THIS AFTERNOON SO THANK YOU AT DIRECTOR JOHNSON FOR JOINING US I KNOW YOU HAVE A FULL SCHEDULE SO- WE APPRECIATE WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESIDENT YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY AND- PLEASE FILL. A PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. A GOOD MORNING TEARS IN MEMBERS CAN JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I YOUR AGENDA TODAY OUTLINES A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS RESPONSIBLE TO OVERSEEING WE HAVE FIVE PROGRAMS WITH OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS BRANCH WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. AT EACH OF THOSE FIVE WERE PROGRAMS GREW OUT OF THE NEED TO INTEGRATE IN ADDRESS THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WITHIN THE POPULATIONS THAT WERE SERVING AND THAT'S HOW THEY HAVE DEVELOPED OVER TIME. SO THE FIVE PROGRAMS ASSIST CHILDREN FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUR HOUSING INSTABILITY WHO ARE SERVED BY VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY THOSE INCLUDE OUR CAO WORKS PROGRAM CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR FAMILIES EMPLOYMENT SERVICES CHILD WELFARE COUNTY GENERAL ASSISTANCE GENERAL RELIEF. DISABILITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES LL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF EACH OF THOSE INCLUDING AT THE RECENT NUMBERS OF THOSE SERVED. OUR CAL WORKS HOUSING SUPPORTING PROBST HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM IS A STATE FUNDED PROGRAM IN WHICH PARTICIPATING COUNTIES PROVIDE HOUSING RELATED SUPPORTS TO ELIGIBLE CAO WORKS FAMILIES. THOUGH SUPPORTS INCLUDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HOUSING RELATED WRAPAROUND SERVICES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO RENTAL ASSISTANCE HOUSING OUT REACHING NAVIGATE CASE MANAGEMENT SECURITY DEPOSITS UTILITY PAYMENTS AND MORE. AT THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM LIKE ALL OF OUR HOUSING PROGRAMS USES THE HOUSE HOUSING FIRST MODEL- IN THAT IS AN ACQUIREMENT THAT I THINK THE SENATE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE HOUSING INCLUDING COUNCIL IS REQUIRING IN STATUTES REQUIRING- WE ALSO INSURE THAT ALL OF OUR COUNTIES IN THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM COLLABORATE WITH THEIR LOCAL CONTINUUM'S OF CARE OR THEIR CEO SEES. THE SUPPORT PROGRAM INTO WORKS THIS BUT POPPY. I BEGAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT AND HAS NOW GROWN TO NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT BUDGET. WE HAVE FIFTY THREE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES PARTICIPATING. AND THE NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND FAMILIES HAVE BEEN HOUSE SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO THE HOUSING SUPPORT CREEK PROGRAM WE HAVE A HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WITHIN OUR CAO WORKS AB- ARRAY AND THAT'S MORE OF AN EMERGENCY SHELTER PROGRAM TO BLEND IN BRAID WITH THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR MORE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS. HAVE BECOME WORKS HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AGAIN SERVES THE SAME POPULATION BUT FOR HOMELESS ASSISTANCE YOU MUST ALSO HAVE LESS THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS IN LIQUID RESOURCES OR CASH ON HAND. THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THAT- THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. A MEDICALLY VERIFIED PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ILLNESS IN THOSE EXPERIENCING A FIRE ON THAT OR NATURAL DISASTER BEYOND THE FAMILIES CONTROL. OUR EX HOUSING IS THAT HOMELESS ASSISTANCE CAN PROVIDE PAYMENTS FOR TEMPORARY SHELTER FOR UP TO SIXTEEN DAYS. AS WELL AS PAYMENTS TO SECURE OR MAINTAIN HOUSING INCLUDING A SECURITY DEPOSIT OR LAST MONTH'S RENT OR UP TO TWO MONTHS OF RENT A REAR AGES. WE HAVE SEEN IT PRETTY STEADY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS COUNTIES AS SERVING AROUND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH ARE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SPENDING- IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR- OVER SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ON THAT PARTICULAR EFFORT. SHIFTING FROM FAMILIES- IN OUR CAO WORKS PROGRAM TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE IN OUR CHILD WELFARE AT PROGRAM AND SO THEY'RE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME. IS A PROGRAM INTENDED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS INCREASE FAMILY REUNIFICATION AND PREVENT FOSTER CARE PLACEMENTS. BRINGING FAMILIES HOME SERVICE HOMELESS FAMILIES INVOLVED WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO OFFER THOSE SUPPORTS TO HELP FAMILIES REUNIFY. IT OFFERS FINANCIAL INSISTENCE ON HOUSING RELATED WRAPAROUND SERVICES VERY SIMILAR TO THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED IN OUR CAO WORKS AT HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM. WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN A RECENT ALLOCATION FOR ANOTHER THREE YEARS TO CONTINUE THIS EFFORT AT JULY OF NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THE FIRST AT ROUND AS FUNDING FOR THIS AT AT FOR WE HAVE SERVED OVER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FAMILIES. I'D IN EIGHTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE OTHER FAMILIES HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY HOUSE- WE ARE- RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF A EVALUATION OF THIS PROGRAM CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB IN THOSE INITIAL FINDINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER THIS CALENDAR YEAR. THE NEXT I PROGRAM THAT WE EVER SEE IS THE HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM WHICH IS FOCUSED ON OUT REACH CASE MANAGEMENT BENEFITS ADVOCACY AND HOUSING SUPPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE DISABLED ARE LIKELY DISABLED AND WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AND THOSE WHO RELY MOST HEAVILY ON STATE AND COUNTY FUNDED SERVICES ARE GIVEN THE PART HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THIS PROGRAM- WE REFER TO THIS PROGRAM IS EIGHT STOP IT FOLLOWS UP AGAIN THE HOUSING FOR SMALLER. MODEL WITH RAPIDITY HOUSING AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. COUNTIES OR TRIBES OPERATING DATE STEP PROGRAM MUST WORKING COLLABORATION COORDINATION WITH THE CEO SEES- IN THIS PROGRAM- WE HAVE SINCE DECEMBER ELEVEN HUNDRED OF WHICH HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY HOUSED. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OF HAVE HAD A DISABILITY APPLICATION SUBMITTED IN FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE HAVE HAD A DISABILITY APPLICATION APPROVED- WE AGAIN HAVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- AND CURRENT BUDGET FOR THIS PROGRAM OUR APPLICATIONS ARE DUE THIS MONTH FROM COUNTIES WE'VE ALREADY REACHED. THIRTY THREE- AND WILL WORK VERY QUICKLY AT THOSE FUNDS OUT. CAN FINALLY HAVE OUR HOUSING PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ENGAGED WITH THE ADULT PROTECTIVE. SYSTEM THAT'S OUR HOME SAFE PROGRAM. AND AGAIN IT IS SERVING THOSE IMMINENT IMMINENT RISK OF EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO THE ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE NEGLECT SELF NEGLECT OR FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION. OF THE GRANTEES OPERATING HOME SAFE PROGRAMS OFFER A RANGE OF SRATEGIES TO SUPPORT HOUSING SENSIBILITY FOR APS CLIENTS THESE TEND TO BE MORE SHORT TERM- COULD BE LEGAL SERVICES THE FICTION AT PREVENTION HEAVY CLEANING LANDLORD MEDIATION. AMONG OTHER SERVICES. THIS AGAIN HAS A STRONG COLLABORATION BETWEEN EIGHT EIGHT PS AGENCY AND COUNTY AND THE REST OF THE SYSTEM. BACK HOME SAFE HAS BEEN IT HAS A ALLOCATION- A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE SEEN THIS IS A NEW ART THE NEWEST PROGRAM OF THOSE THAT I'VE MENTIONED SO THROUGH DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WE'VE BEEN ROLLED SEVEN HUNDRED AND 50% PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM WE DO EXPECT THIS NUMBER TO INCREASE AS UNFORTUNATELY ALSO. ADD THE NUMBER EIGHT PS AT INDIVIDUALS THAT WE STAVING ACROSS THE STATE IS ALSO INCREASING. TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES ARE FUNDED WITH THIS EFFORT WE WERE ABLE TO BRING ON VIEW COUNTY AS A LATE ADDITION WE GAVE THEM SOME ADDITIONAL TIME AT TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATION PARTICIPATED ALL THE EXPERIENCES THEY'VE HAD WITH DISASTER. THIS IS ALSO ARE GOING TO BE EVALUATED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO I AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING THAT AND THINKING ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH POLICY ALIGNMENT BUT ALSO DATA COLLECTION. AND REPORTING ACROSS ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS CONNECTED WITH MUCH OF THE WORK THAT THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES HOUSING IN COORDINATING COUNCIL ARE DOING IN THAT SPACE. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. HELLO ALEX AND WITH THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY OVERSEEING THAT- HOMES CAR NEEDING FINANCING COUNCIL- SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL CONTEXT I WANTED TO PROVIDE IN SOME OF THE WAYS WE'RE THINKING. ABOUT THE PROBLEM- BEFORE I DIVE INTO SORT OF IT THE CONTEXT OF. DOING SO IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THAT WE HAVE A I HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AT ANY GIVEN TIME THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE- WE EXPECT THAT NUMBER- THE GENERAL ASSUMPTION IS THAT ANY. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR YOU CAN MULTIPLY THAT BY TWO OR THREE TIMES TO GET THE YEARS THE NUMBER OF FOLKS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OVER AN ANNUAL CALENDAR YEAR. THAT PUTS A LOT OF THIS IN CONTEXT THOSE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GOING. I'M CALIFORNIA. TWELVE THE NATION'S TOP BUT 7% OF ITS HOMELESS POPULATION ANARCHIST IS EXPERIENCING A 16% INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AT 21% INCREASE IN A SHELTER HOMELESSNESS. AS THE GOVERNOR ALSO NOTED IN HIS HIS STATE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA. 33% OF THE STATE. HOW IS BOB. PERCENT OF OUR- MISSION GENERALLY. I'M SO IN THAT CONTEXT IS A OF AT HOME IS CREATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL IS WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. I THINK FOLKS ARE MOST FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OF POTS OF FUNDING AND PROGRAMMING BUT I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE TO EXPLAIN ALSO THAT. THE ROLE THAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF COORDINATING AND FINANCING WHICH IS IN OUR TITLE- THE COUNCIL HAS EIGHTEEN STATUTORY GOALS- WHICH WE ARE SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON A FEW KEY PRIORITIES ON THIS YEAR. THE FIRST WHICH CANCER BUT IT TOO- WE ARE DEVELOPING A STATEWIDE HOME A STATE INTEGRATION SYSTEM IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE GOVERNOR STATE STATE WE ARE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS WEEK COULD BEAT THIRD. IN THE COUNTRY YOU SAID AS- IT WOULD ALLOW US TO A- BETTER LOOK AT. THIS HAPPY CROSSED THE STAY IN TERMS OF TRYING. OF WHO SIR. IN TERMS OF WHAT OTHERS. AND THE COMMUNITIES SO THAT IS A REAL EFFORT WERE TAKING ON THAT TO HELP- ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT THAT. PROVIDE HOMELESSNESS FUNDING ACROSS THE STATE TO AT TEN HAVE ACCESS INTO. WE ARE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF DEVELOPING AND WORKING TOWARD THAT I WORK PLAN FOR A DATA DRIVEN EVIDENCE BASED ACTION ORIENTED STRATEGIC PLAN- WE ARE VERY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS. STATE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE IN COORDINATION HAVE A FOR THAT- SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT TO. OUR CANNOT HEAR THE EXCELLENT BUT- WE ALSO HAVE CONTINUED OVERSIGHT OF THE HOUSING FIRST ME IN. ALL DEPARTMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING FOR AS OF THE JULY ISSUE. YEAR BUT WE WILL CONTINUE ENSURE THAT COMPLAINTS IS AS MATT AND AS NEW PRO. ONLINE THEY ARE CALLING. FALLING WITH THAT MANDATE. ALSO IT. CAN DO AND- AS YOU SAID TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM CITING USE FOR A WITH TWO PASS A OF TALK ABOUT JUST A SECOND BUT ALSO TRYING TO A BIT MORE BROADLY ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC POPULATION AND ANSWERED MOST CERTAINLY CONTINUED FELT FACILITATION BETWEEN STATES. HAVE DOING AND PROGRAMS AT A TIME ASSIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WE APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT- ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE A PART OF THIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- MAKING SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND OUR EXPERTISE BUT WORKING CORDON THANK CORDONS AND A GOAL. IN ADDITION TO OF THE COORDINATING CAN SORT OF THE- VIEW. OF ACCOUNTS SO WE ALSO HAVE TO PROGRAMS THAT WE IMPLEMENT. THE FIRST IS OUT LOVINGLY REFER TO AS HE- ARE HOMELESS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. IT WAS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AUTHORIZED IN IN THE FY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET WAS ALLOCATED TO FORTY THREE CAN. MS OF CARE AND LET LARGE CITY IS- ALL FIFTY ORDER SECTIONS EVEN FUNDING WERE REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE A MINIMUM OF 5% OF THE- FUNDING. USE HOMELESS. FUNDS TO BE SPENT BY JUNE OF TWO TWENTY ONE. SO WE- PART OF IT WAS REQUIRED AND STATUES ANNUAL REPORTS FROM ALL OF THE GRANTEES THOSE ARE DUE TO US IN JANUARY AND SO WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF DOING SOME EARLY ANALYSIS ON THAT RIGHT NOW- BUT IS GENERALLY WERE REFINING THAT AS OF SEPTEMBER WHICH IS IN THE ANNUAL REPORT COLLECTED THREE. ALREADY OUT OF THE SPENDING ON HAS BEEN SPENT ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. SISTER PRIMARILY INCREASING SHELTER CAPACITY. THEIR MARGINS EACH OTHER'S AN APPLICATION CENTERS. SERVICES SUCH AS STREET OUT REGION HOUSING NAVIGATORS- APPEAR TO BE THE SECOND LARGEST CATEGORY OF SPENDING RIGHT NOW. FOLLOWED BY RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND SUBSIDIES. OVERALL WE ARE SEEING COMMUNITIES I'M REALLY THINKING CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS THE MAJORITY OF NEEDS ARE FUN ARE USING THEIR FUNDING SORT OF AND THREE GENERAL CATEGORIES IS HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT- SORT OF AN INNOVATION OR CREATION SORT OF THINKING ABOUT USING THIS FUNDING IS A NEW WAY TO TEST ANY THING IN THERE YOUR THINK ABOUT SOMETHING. I HAVEN'T ANY DO BEFORE. ONLY SOME THAT WAS SUCCESS PIE. BUT NOT ABLE TO REACH THE FULL POPULATION. FOR REASSESSING AND REVAMPING THEIR AT THEIR SORT OF HOMELESS SYSTEM AND HOW FOLKS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS INTO IT. WE'RE ALSO SEEING SOME REALLY EXCITING SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS FOR YOU SORT OF UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU ACCESS THE SYSTEM AND THAT THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS MIGHT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FOCUS- AND A REAL STRONG COMMITMENT TO. TO HOUSING FIRST FOR THE PER THE MANDATE. SPECIFICALLY ON USE- WE'RE SEEING SOME REALLY INTERESTING INVESTMENTS IN EMERGENCIES SOLUTIONS AND COMMUNITY PLACES WHERE YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SAFE SPACE. TO BE SHELTERED- ARE HAVE A SAFE SPACE TO COME INDOORS- REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS A BIT MORE ON THAT IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY DID THERE WAS NOT ACCESS TO THAT IN THE PAST. AND REALLY FOCUSING ON WHERE THE BROADER HOMELESSNESS AND CAN BETTER SUPPORT YOU SPECIFIC SERVICES. WE ARE ALSO PARTNERING WITH CSU SACRAMENTO- WHO IS IN THE MIDST OF DRAFTING A FINAL VERSION OF AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ON HEAT THAT WILL REALLY TALK ABOUT MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS. OF WHEN THIS KIND OF FUNDING GOES OUT INTO A COMMUNITY HOW DID THEY THINK ABOUT IT HOW DID THE STAT INTERACT- AND SORT OF WHAT ARE THEY THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOW TO USE THE FUNDING THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT FOR EARLY. IN ADDITION HE- OUT LAST YEAR WE WERE ALSO THAT TASKED WITH ALLOCATING ARE HALF FUNDING ARE ARE HOMELESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM- A SIX AND A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO ALL OF OUR CONTINUUM'S OF CARE ALL. FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THIRTEEN LARGE CITIES. ALL HUNDRED FOURTEEN JURISDICTIONS ARE RECEIVING FUNDING. REQUIRED ALLOCATE A MINIMUM. 8% SO ABOUT FROM FROM HEAT- 8% ON YOU SPENDING. OFTEN THAT MUST BE SPENT BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- AND WE JUST RECENTLY PASSED THE DEADLINE FOR APPLICATIONS INTRODUCED ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH SO THE TEAM IS VERY ACTIVELY REVIEWING- FOR COMPLETION ALL OF THOSE APPLICATION AS WE SPEAK- SINCE SOME DIFFERENCES FROM KEEP TO THAT TO HAPPEN I WOULD TO SORT OF LIKE TO CALL OUT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO SORT OF UNDERSTAND. THAT THE TRANSITION SORT OF THAT THE- MAC PATH WE'VE BEEN ON FOR SOME OF THIS. APP DOES HAVE MORE STRICT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OF HOW THE FUNDING CAN BE SPENT. AND TO REALLY CLEAR ODD BUCKETS AROUND ELIGIBLE USE. IT ALSO HAS A STRONGER REQUIRE DEMONSTRATION FOR REGIONAL COLLABORATION WE REQUIRED LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM OVERLAPPING JURISDICTIONS- SO IF THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF CARE THEY NEED A LETTER FROM THEIR CSE AND THEIR LARGE CITY TO SAY THAT EVERYBODY WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO SPEND THIS FUNDING LOCALLY IN THE SAME DIRECTION. MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE WAS SORT OF ROWING IN IN THE SAME IN THE SAME. DIRECTION AND THE REQUIRING CLEAR GOALS ATTACHED TO THAT FUNDING IS A REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WITH HIS ADDITIONAL INFUSION OF FUNDING AT THE END OF THIS PROGRAM WHAT WHAT THEY EXPECT TO SEE. IN ADDITION TO THOSE TWO BY THE FUNDING WE ALSO ARE IN THE MIDST OF- THE GOVERNOR'S HUNDRED DAY CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT ON. A REALLY REMARKABLE TECHNICAL. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER RAPID RESULTS INSTITUTE WHO HAS DONE THESE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY- THOSE WILL BE LAUNCHING THE FIRST COHORT HERE JUST IN A COUPLE WEEKS THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED. THAT THE GROUP OF. THOSE WITH LAYS BOSS ALAMEDA AND RIVERSIDE STARTING JUST IN A COUPLE WEEKS. I'M REALLY THAT THE INTENT OF THAT IS TO BE A REALLY INTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROCESS. AND DAY. LOOK AT. IN THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE. ON IT COULD BE CHANGED WHERE'S ROCKER SEE THAT NEEDS TO BE BROKEN DOWN. WORK A STREAMLINE THINGS THAT EVERYONE IS REALLY. IN THE SAME DRESS AND THERE. ARE A HUNDRED DAYS WHAT HAPPENS IN AND WHAT IS THE- RESORT MISTER. AND FROM THAT. IS ALSO. SOME WORKS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. SO THERE WILL BE. A COURT OF THAT STARTING HERE IN A COUPLE WEEKS A SECOND COVERT STARTING IN MAY AND A THIRD COURT STARTING THIS SUMMER. WE ARE ALSO- AT IT RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING A LOT OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. SO AS YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT WE RELEASED TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX STATE OWNED PROPERTIES SORT OF ACCESS STATE LAND- JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THAT IS POSTED ON OUR HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL'S WEBSITE FOR COMMUNITIES. USE FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERING PURPOSS- SHELTER SERVICES AN OPERATING COSTS I JUST WOULD LIKE TO CALL OUT FOR THOSE CAN BE FUNDED TO KEEP AND HAPPY SO THERE IS FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THOSE PROPERTIES TO ACTION. I'M USE THEM LOCAL COMMUNITIES- AN EMPLOYER IN THE MIDST OF A- YOU CAN MENTION IT. IS OF PROPERTIES. THE THROUGH THAT THERE WERE HER TRAVEL TRAILERS THAT ALL BEEN. TO THESE OF FOR ALSO FOR EMERGENCIES ALTERING PURPOSES. AB FOR BOTH THE TRAILERS AND THE STATE LANDS WE WILL BE COLLECTING- PERFORMANCE- METRICS ON THAT- ON A MONTHLY BASIS AS SOON AS INDIVIDUALS ARE. DONE TO THE PROPERTY SO WE EXPECT IT TO HAVE A ON HIS AND HAVING THAT UP ON OUR WEBSITE. AS SOON AS THAT IS AVAILABLE. HALF I WILL STOP. IT'S THE GENERAL GIST A BIT WITH THE TEAM IS WORKING ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OUR FIRST PANEL. CENTER WHAT CASKEY. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WE THE THEORY IS THAT WE GIVE 20% OF MONEY THAT FROM THE AUCTION PRICE TO FOR HOUSING. IS THAT BECAUSE ITS STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY INTERACT WITH YOUR PROGRAMS AT ALL- AND I DID AND THEY WERE SORT OF BUILDING DENSER HOUSING ON TRANSIT LINES YET AT THAT ACT HOW IT IS THERE ANY CONNECTION COLLABORATION BETWEEN. THE FIVE PROGRAMS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- THEY KEEP KEEP IN ALL THESE THINGS IS OR ANY COMMUNICATION WITH THIS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WE SPEND. MUCH I CAN SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS I WILL SAY WHERE THERE IS- GENERALLY SPEAKING AND THIS ISN'T JUST AT THE STATE DOES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TWO THERE IS OFTEN SILENT BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING- AND SETTLE IT POP WHAT THE HOMELESS CORNING AND FAXING COUNCIL IS FOCUSED. ON IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO SORT OF. MANAGE THAT THAT DIVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARLY THE STRATEGICAL COUNCILS NOT ON THE COUNT ON OUR HOME IS CREATING AN FINANCING COUNCIL AND SO PRO THE HOUSE. GRANT ARE NOT INCLUDED ON THE COUNCIL ISJUST THOMAS PROGRAMS TO WERE WORKING WITH IN FORMAL WEAR BUT I WOULD SAY THERE IS NOTHING I'M MORE. I OUR PROGRAM. YOU KNOW I GET I WOULD USE THAT FOR THE PRO THAT WE ADMINISTER AT THE CONCEPTS AROUND BOTH THE INTEGRATION OF THE SUPPORTS FOR IT THAT LARGER AND BROADER PROGRAM EFFORTS OF ANY OF THESE GIVEN POPULATIONS BUT ALSO THAT CONNECTION BACK TO HOW THIS PARTICULAR THIS PARTICULAR DOLLARS AND RESOURCES CAN BE LEVERAGED THROUGHOUT THE STRATEGIES LOCAL IN THE CASE THAT THERE'S PLANNING THAT OCCURS. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WE ARE. THIS INSTANCE THE ABOUT HOW THE FOR. IN THESE POPPY. CAN BE USED IN MAX THE PLAN IN IN THE GIVEN CAN. SO WE WOULD JUST BE BY CHANCE THAT SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WAS COMING FROM THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL SOME. COUNTY APPLICANT OR SOMEBODY HAPPENED TO LOOK FOR SOME OF THAT MONEY THAT MAY PROVIDE. HOUSING LOW INCOME HOUSING- HOUSING FOR- THIS POPPED UP THE HOMELESS POPULATION OF THE RE RE HOUSE POEMS POPULATION SHE SAID WHICH IS A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE IF IT HAPPENS BUT NOT GETTING INTO THE CRISPY UNCLE QUESTION BUT- YOU KNOW I DO THINK AND THIS IS WHERE AE YOU SEE PARTNERS PROBABLY COULD SPEAK MORE CLEARLY TO SOME OF THESE PIECES. I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE PROGRAM YOU'RE REFERENCING BUT I DO KNOW A LOT OF THAT THE EFFORTS AROUND BUILDING HOUSING AND THEN THE GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN FROM HD HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON- WHERE THERE IS PRIORITY GIVEN FOR HOME OF HOMELESS OR FORMALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS I THINK THAT IS A PIECE OF THIS THIS PUZZLE THAT- THE POPULATIONS WERE. SERVING OBVIOUSLY NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO WE'RE JUST A PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE JUST SORT OF LIKE THEIR PIECE OF OURS SO I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF. THAT MORE THAN A- COULD BE DONE HAS THE TITLE OF OUR COUNCIL WERE THREE YEARS OLD BUT- I THINK THAT PART OF WHAT WE SEE OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS HELPING COMMUNITIES THANKS TO ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAM FOR STATE IS GIVING OUT. AND HOW TO BEST USE THOSE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. HAVE SENATOR BELL AND THEN FOLLOWED BY CENTER MORE LOCK. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND WORK AND ALL THE GOOD WORK YOU'RE DOING APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH- I WANTED US ABOUT- SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION IN. MY DISTRICT- WITH THE LARGE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE SOME OF THE STATE. IT ALSO. THE URBAN COMMUNITY COLLEGE LIKE SAN JOSE'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE- THERE'S A LOT OF HOMELESS STUDENTS OKAY THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE THE SAN JOSE IS A VERY EXPENSIVE PLACE TO LIVE OF. STUDENTS SO. I DON'T HAVE ANY MEANS A LOT OF CASES OF. LIVING IN SAN JOSE- IT'S NOT ON AFFORDABLE AREA. THERE'S A LOT OF AND THE CUTS CURRENTLY THERE'S A LOT OF HOMELESS STUDENTS I FOUND OUT THERE'S A LOT OF HOMELESS STUDENTS ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN OUR STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. SO DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC. SEPARATE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH. WORKING WITH THE INSTITUTIONS. OF TO SOLVE THE STUDENT HOMELESS PROBLEM IS TO ARM. I THINK IT IT BEARS SELECT OR SOME KIND OF WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OF THE CHANCELLOR THE COLLEGES ALL THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS SO DO YOU HAVE ANY. OF SEPARATE APPROACHES ARE STRATEGIES RELATED TO- STUDENT HOMELESSNESS. YES OF THE CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES WAS JUST INCLUDED ON OUR COUNCIL IN THIS LAST YEAR'S AND A STATUTORY CHANGE IN LAST YEAR'S STATUTE SO THEY ARE NOW ON THE COUNCIL AND WE'RE WORKING WITH MY CLOSELY THEY ALSO AND I CAN'T SPEAK FULLY DO THIS BUT THEY ALSO HAD SOME FUNDING GIVEN TO THEM LAST YEAR TO HELP CREEK CALLUSES SPECIFICALLY WORK ON THIS ISSUE. YEAH SO I THINK THAT THEY THAT IS A PROGRAM THAT THEY ARE RUNNING THAT WERE HELP WITH THE SEARCH AND I THINK THAT PART OF WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO AS WE THINK ABOUT THE HEAT AND A HALF FUNDING WAS NOT SPECIFIC TO STUDENTS THAT IS SPECIFIC. THAT NAY PERCENT SEVENTY IT THEY ARE A LOT WORSE THE BOTTOM YOU SOUND A LOT ABOUT YOU FUNDING GOING TOWARDS RENTAL SUBSIDIES WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY COMPETE. FOR A CALL. PROTECT SO IT. THE BROUGHT. IS NOT FUNDING CAN BE TARGETING WE'VE SEEN ON. OF CAN YOU THAT FOR THEIR COMMITTEE CALL THERE'S POP. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE SERRANO OWNS. THE THEY- THE DEALS WITH HOMELESS STUDENTS. OR IS IT FUNDS THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS. BEEN SAVES THE QUESTION I MEAN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I MOVING YOUR YES SHE HAS A VESSEL FOR SORRY ABOUT THAT. GOOD AND EVERY WHEN YOU SERGEANT FOR CLARIFICATION WHEN YOU SAID THEY ARE YOU SAYING THAT COMMITTEE CALLING ME TO COLLEGES THE STATE COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES UNIVERSE CAL I AM. CONFERENCE THE- UNIVERSITY THERE IS FUNDING THAT THEY ALL RECEIVED I BELIEVE JUST LAST YEAR I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE DETAILS ON IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONE OF THE PROGRAMS WE ADMINISTER. BUT THEY HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE STATE MUST HAVE IN. WELL I'M WHAT I AM ROWS SUBURBAN I KIND OF THIS. THAT THEIR SIR GETTING LOST IN THE SHUFFLE OF THE DISCUSSION. AND NOBODY. RESPOND FOR THE STRATEGY WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE IN OF A STRATEGY. MAYBE ON STUDENT ALMOST US. OF STUDENT HOMELESSNESS IS I'VE PERSONALLY FIND A LOT OF THE STUDENTS THERE ALMOST HAPPEN TO BE FOSTER YOU. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THROUGH. ARM THE UNIVERSITY OF SCHOLARS SYSTEM HELLO THE FOSTER YOU FOR. TYPICALLY NOT AWARE OF THE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. AND SO THE THEIR UNDER THOSE PROGRAMS ARE UNDER SUBSCRIBED. YOU KNOW THE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS THE OTHER. KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED YOU KNOW SINCE WE BUILT WE WROTE AB TWELVE ON THE LEGISLATION ON FOSTER YOU SOME KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT. OF JUST THE. THE FACT THAT. THIS ISSUE IS A SEPARATELY ADDRESSED IT I KIND OF HAVE A I'M SORRY TO GET A PICTURE THAT THIS SHOULD BE SEPARATELY MAYBE- A CATEGORY OF ITSELF THE COULD BE ADDRESSED SPECIFICALLY WITH A STRATEGY OFFICE YEAH I WOULD I WOULD URGE WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS AT THE MOMENT AND SO WHAT WHAT I'M I'M HOPING OUR STRATEGIC PLAN DOES IS SORT OF LOOK AT- THE BROAD POPULATION AND WHERE THERE NEEDS TO BE SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS FOR SUB POPULATIONS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS A PART OF A- THING. BUT HOPE BAKER THIRTY PLAN THAT ALSO THING THAT FIVE WITH THE THAT I THE PROPER FROM THE COLLEGE ON THE COUNT MOTHER THE VOICE TO IT TO SORT OF CONTINUE ON THE ROTATION THAT HAD NOT BEEN THERE THIS YEAR. IN A NEW VOICE TO THE CAP. IT TO SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'RE SPEAKING. I'LL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO IN TERMS OF FOSTER YOU SPECIFICALLY IN TRANSITIONAL AGE YOU CAN THE WORK OF AB TWO TWO AB TWELVE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL HOUSING SUPPORTS THAT WE OFFERED THAT'S AS SUPERVISE INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PLUS PROGRAMS. IN THE LAST BUDGET- WE ALSO SUPPORTED AD DOLLARS FOR HOUSING NAVIGATION FOR FOSTER YOUTH- THAT'S ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT SO THERE THERE IS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE- WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ADDITIONAL AS ART OPTIONAL PROGRAMS IN MANY COUNTIES. AND SO TO THE WE WANT TO STAND WITH THE DISH. THE TWENTY THAT THEY CAN BE OFFERED THIS IS A- CASES BURKE FOR CERTAIN AGE GROUPS WOULD BE REQUIRED IN MANDATED TO SUPPORT- BUT THOSE ALSO WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF OUT OF OUT OVER TWENTY ONE AND IN SUPPORT CENTER NEEDED I THINK IS ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS NOT FOR TODAY'S AGENDA BUT ALSO THE PROPOSED AT HOUSING FIND. AS A PRIORITY FOR USE IN A INCLUDED AS WELL SO- ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO KIND OF REALLY ENSURE THAT THAT- TRANSITIONAL AG POP. GETTING THIS THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AS THEY TRANSITION ON. OF THE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH AYE I THINK THE- ESTIMATED RECENTLY THAT WAS FIFTY THOUSAND HOMELESS STUDENTS. AND A CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGE SYSTEM- THAT DOESN'T DRY WITH OUR HOMELESS SENSES. AND IT IS VERY IT'S VERY APPARENT. THAT THE STUDENTS ARE NOT COUNTED A LOT OF THE USE ARE COUNTED. WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD ACCURATE. ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM IS. AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD DEVELOP SOME STRATEGIES SEPARATE TO THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE WITH JUNE HOMELESSNESS. IS NOT APPARENT RIGHT NOW THE COUNTS DON'T PICK UP THESE PEOPLE OF. AND I'M AFRAID I'M AFRAID THEIR PHONE AND BETWEEN THE CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM. AND WERE UNDER ESTIMATING WHAT THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM AS I JUST MENTIONED TWO THINGS WE ARE ALSO RESPOND ARE IMPLEMENTING THE HOMELESS YOUTH ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND JUST RECENTLY GOT STAFF ON BOARD- TAT TO HELP THE SPECIFICALLY ON ON USED IN A LOT OF THE GOALS THAT BOTH IN THAT ACT AND- IN OUR- CREATE INSTEAD. OUR TO YOU AROUND BETTER IDENTIFY PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD WE FULLY AGREE- AND WE'RE WE'RE FINALLY GETTING STEPPED UP TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES MORE FULLY. SO EAGER AND WILLING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE SENATOR MORLOCK NEXT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- TO JUMP ON THE PHRASE YOU JUST USE SUBPOPULATIONS I'D LIKE TO- YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HOMELESS POPULATION I'VE BEEN IN THE SPACE FOR A LONG TIME. INCLUDING CHAIRING THE- COMMISSION IN HOMELESSNESS FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AS A SUPERVISOR IN OUR COUNTY. SO THE RECORD'S PRETTY BROAD. FOR SOME BUT JUST EMERGENCY THAT. JUST CAN'T FIND A FEW HUNDRED TO PAY THE RENT. TO THE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL SO I KIND F WANT TO DISCUSS THAT A LITTLE BIT- GOVERNOR NEWSOME GAVE A RATHER UNIQUE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS. IN VERY NARROW VERY FOCUSED- BUT HE ADDRESSED MENTAL ILLNESS AND- MAYBE THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THE LANTERN PATRICK BACK MENTIONED. TIME MAYBE LOWERS LAW WITH MENTIONED. IN THE STATE OF THE STATE'S ARE. THEN THAT BASED A LONG TIME AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. WITH HIS AGENDA ABNAKI THAT'S HIS FOCUS AND IT'S- REALLY EXCITING TO ME THAT. THE GOVERNOR WOULD WANT TO GO INTO THIS AREA AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP SO HOW HOW ARE YOU MISS JOHNSON HOW ARE YOU COORDINATING. THE GOVERNOR HOUSE SOCIAL SERVICES- YOU KNOW OF RAMPING UP. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE BECAUSE ICE. TOO MANY SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE AND I DON'T SEE THEM MENTIONED YOUR FIVE PROGRAMS AND I SEE THAT THIS IS MAYBE YOU WERE REALLY NEED TO. BUT EMPHASIS. A COUPLE THINGS I'D SAY ONE IS THAT- OUR PART WE HAVE ASH PARTNERSHIPS HERE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- AND I WOULD SAY THE- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT RIGHT THOSE ARE THE TWO PLACES WHERE THOSE. FUNDS ARE ARE SUPPORTED. OUR IN RESPONSE I THINK PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS ALSO A THINKING THROUGH AT THE MEDI CAL HEALTHIER CAL. ARE THAT OR THE CAL A MAN SHE DIDN'T THAT'S LOOKING TO TRANSFORM THE STATE'S MEDICAL SYSTEM TO BETTER SERVE AT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IT'S REALLY RUN THE CHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. THE IDEA IN THE POST FOR THEM THE AIM PROPOSAL IN THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SUPPORT INCLUDING. ALL SPORTS. AT OUR FOR SYSTEM IS IN FIND IT IS PIECE THAT CAN'T BE COVERED MEDI CAL THE ACTUAL SAID ACT RENT PAYMENT TO. TO THESE INITIATIVES ARE BEING PROPOSED AS A WAY TO BE INTEGRATED TOGETHER TO SERVE POPULATIONS AND I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO THINK THAT I THINK ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT I MENTIONED TO YOU THAT WE ARE- ADMINISTERING THERE CERTAINLY WOULD BE PORTIONS OF THE POPULATION THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTING MENTAL HEALTH CONNECTION MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CERTAINLY WE HAVE. A DEDICATED DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM- THAT IS JUST FOR CONNECTIONS MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE. USE AND SO FORTH SO IT'S REALLY AROUND HOW WE ARE IN. HEALTH ARRAY OF PACKAGE BETWEEN THE MEDI CAL SERVICES IN IN WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO CHANGE IN THAT SPACE. AND ALSO WHAT WERE AB PROPOSING IN TERMS OF NEW DOLLARS THAT SUPPORT THAT RENTAL SUBSIDY TO BOTH PREVENT THOSE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS- BUT ALSO TO SUPPORT THOSE COMING OFF OF THE STREET. BY SPIN LESS YEAR. SING MYSELF BETTERMENT YOUR SHORT IT DIDN'T. END IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THERE. WE DECIDED THAT. MENTAL INSTITUTIONS REMAINED SO WE- CLOSE THEM. ON THE ASSUMPTION THERE WOULD BECOMMUNITY SERVICES. BUT THAT WERE NEVER COMMUNITY SERVICES SO. THEY WENT TO THE STREET THEY WENT TO THE JAILS AND SO. THE LARGEST MENTAL INSTITUTION IN MY COUNTY IS. THE CENTRAL JAIL IN DOWNTOWN. SANTA ANNA'S SO. WHAT INITIATIVE ARE WE DOING BECAUSE WE METS TAPPED. YOU KNOW HALF OF THE PROGRAM WHAT WERE OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES TO HELP THE MENTALLY ILL ON OUR STREETS YOU KNOW IN THE TENT CITIES WITH WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR. I ACT I MET WITH HIM AFTER THE HE MADE HIS PRESENTATION THAT AFTERNOON AND I GAVE THEM OUR STUDY ON LPS. HIS EYES WENT WIDE OPEN AND IN THIS THE STAFF MEMBER SAID YOU KNOW WE HAD A CUT HIS SPEECH BY AN HOUR BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO JUST GIVE A LECTURE ON LPS. SO I AM REALLY EXCITED THAT HE'S FOCUSED ON IT BUT- WHERE IS THE PROGRAM WHERE THE IDEAS WERE THE- WORST THE MEAT FOR THE BONE SO WE CAN. I THINK ADDRESS THE MOST CRITICAL. COMPONENT OF OUR OBVIOUS HOMELESS PROBLEM. THAT THAT THE- THAT THE CONSTITUENTS ARE SAYING EVERY DAY WHEN THEY DRIVE THEIR CARS THROUGH DOWN. AL ALL ALL MENTION I AM OUR OUR SISTER AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT TO ADD A DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS ALSO HAS A PILOT SPECIFIC TO SUPPORTING THE HOUSING NEEDS OF THOSE WHO ARE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL SO I. THOUGHT THAT I WOULD DEFER TO THEM FOR MORE DETAIL ON THAT PROPOSAL IN INITIATIVE BUT I THINK. AS CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE DOLLARS AND YOU HEARD THE GOVERNOR IN THE STATE STATE AS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS. A NEEDING TO ENSURE DOLLARS ARE SPENT IN PRIORITIZE AND SO I THINK THAT'S A CONTINUED CONVERSATION THAT WOULD ONE EXPLORE EXPLORE THE LEGISLATURE. TO IDENTIFY HOW WE NEED TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU WHAT YOU'RE IDENTIFYING SO ARE WE GIVING THE SYSTEM I'M WITH THE SAY MAYOR STEINBERG WHO WROTE. PROPS THE THREE TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT TO SAVE. HIM THAT JUST WHAT'S OF A WHICH- SCANNER CARES ARE WE DO THAT IS A LAWYER WITH BE YOUR TO. OR WOULD THAT BE. THURMOND IN. WHERE DO WE GO. YEAH I KNOW I THINK IT WOULD BE A COMBINATION ADDS ADDS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND- ARE AT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT COMMISSION THOSE ARE THE TWO EIGHT. SIXTY THREE THAT'S RIGHT. THE OVERSIGHT AT CURRENT FOR THAT. FIVE AND A SO I THINK THROUGH THE TWO ENTITIES. PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE IT CERTAINLY THE IDEA IS IN ALL OF THESE EFFORTS IS AROUND INTEGRATION SO HOW ARE WE REALLY TAKING. THE ARRAY OF STE IS THAT BAD BILL TOOK. THE END ON THE- AT THAT THAT WERE THAT WERE. AND THAT'S THE CON. HE WILL HE'S SAID HE'S THE BECAUSE OUR- FOR HOMELESS I WE WILL HELP THEM. BUT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I JUST WANNA KNOW HOW I CAN HELP. THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON. THANK YOU PERCENT THANK YOU MANAGER. SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU YES IN RESPONSE TO THAT THE LPS CHECKED OF COURSE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL- REQUIREMENT SETTING A STANDARD BECAUSE WE ARE IN TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S. BONTA THAT'S WHAT CREEK THAT ADDITIONAL LAYER OF CONCERNED- I AM CONFIDENT THAT THAT ISSUE IS NOW BEING REVIEWED AND CONSIDERED- BUT IN SOME OF THE- INVESTIGATION I'VE DONE A PART OF THE PROBLEM APPARENTLY HIS IN THAT OR THE PLUS SERVICES A BILLABLE BOTH A TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT INVOLUNTARY AND CAN SERVE STATE AND WE'RE NOT AT THAT STATE SO I'M ASSUMING THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT PARTICULAR WITH PROP SIX MONEY MONEY. BY THE OF. RESEARCH SO THAT THE COURT BORDERS EITHER AN INVOLUNTARY A CONSERVATORSHIP OR DOES NOT ORDER IT THAT THAT THAT MAY BE THROUGH VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS I GLORIA SLOW WHICH I KNOW CENTER WIENER HAS SOME KNOWLEDGE OF WE WORK THAT ISSUE QUITE EXTENSIVELY. AND I KNOW YOU WELL CENTER MORE LIKE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT IT- THAT WE HAVE NECESSARY SERVICES FOR THOSE PEOPLE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO FIND OURSELVES ARGUING OVER WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE THEY QUALIFIED TO THE UP A SACK FOR A- FOR INVOLUNTARY INC A SENSUAL IN THRACIAN. BUT MY- I IT FOLD ONE IS I WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR USE- BOTH OUR FOSTER YOUTH THE USED TO HAVE- FOR WHATEVER REASON LEFT HOME IN OUR COLLEGE USE- WHO ARE LIVING OUT OF THEIR CARS AND EATING ROM AND ALL DAY LONG AND THINGS THAT ARE CLEARLY NOT IN THEIR BEST HEALTH INTEREST HI GOOD ACTORS PROBABLY CONFIRM THAT IT MAYBE. ONCE A WEEK TWICE WEEK BUT- NEEDING FOOD PANTRIES IN LIVING OUT OF THEIR CARS- LIVING HOMESICK. BUT A AND I KNOW THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE'S ARE. A SPEAKING WITH A STRONGER VOICE NOW BUT THE VOICE WE DON'T SEEM TO CARE AS MUCH OF IS THE VOICE OF SENIORS. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE NUMBER OF SENIORS WHO HAVE BECOME HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES AFTER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT THAT THIS FIFTY FIVE SHOULDN'T QUALIFIED AS A SENIOR THAT MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS BUT- BUT ASSUMING THAT IT IS. I I'M WAY OVER THE HILL THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE BUT IT USING THAT CORPUS FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND ALL OR- ENTER. IS THAT A- WE ARE SEEING THE PEOPLE ARE AT THAT AGE GROUP IN ABOVE HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES AND NOT BECAUSE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET OVER THAT TRANSITION IF THEY LOSE A ROOMMATE OR- BREADWINNER I KNOW THERE'S SOME PROGRAM. THIS IS A- A- AN ISSUE THAT HAS SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION IT'S BEING USED ELSEWHERE AND I WONDERED- JUST LISTENING TO NPR A FEW WEEKS AGO- THE CITY OF CHICAGO HAS A PROGRAM WHERE PEOPLE CALL IN AND THEY GO THROUGH OF. RELATIVELY GENTLE SCREENING PROCESS AND ARE GIVEN THE A STIPEND TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH THE TIME WE'RE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE AFFECTED AND THAT- THE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. WHEN AFTER GIVING UP TO A SEVERAL MONTHS I THINK IS IN SOME INSTANCES BUT THAT THEY NEVER HEAR FROM 75% OF THOSE PEOPLE AGAIN. IN OTHER WORDS IT HAVEN'T WE STABILIZE THEIR LIVES ARE ABLE TO PAY THEIR OWN- HOUSING EXPENSES AND ARE. NOT ON THE STREETS AND FRANKLY HAVING MANAGE IN THE WINTER I WANT TO BE ON THE STREET THERE. IN THE WITH. END OF THE- RING IF THERE ARE ANY PRO HE- IF THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING- HOME HOMES FOR SENIORS WHO MAY OTHERWISE BE PERMANENTLY HOMELESS AND- CLEARLY AT THE LEAST ABLE AND MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. WHAT KIND OF EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS ARE HOMELESS AND- FACILITIES IN FACT WRAP WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES WHAT HAVE YOU. FOR OUR SENIOR POPULATION TO THE TO QUESTION BUT THE- ARE REALLY TO SENIOR ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD SHARE THAT WITH. HER I'LL START WITH- THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET FOR THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS HOUSING FIND IT HAS. IS THE IS TO PROVIDE X. THAT THE RENTS. EXAM THAT YOU FOR POPULATIONS THE SECOND IS TO ACTUALLY BUILD AND DEVELOP ADDITIONAL FORD WILL HOUSING AND THE THIRD IS. STABILIZING ABOARD AND CARE OR ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND SO THAT THE PROPOSAL AS A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR AT INVESTMENT IN THIS SPACE AND- THAT'S EXACTLY CONCEPT THAT AND- YOU KNOW APPROACH REGIONAL STRAIGHT. WOULD OPPOSE ON THE ON. OF THE INCIDENT AT I DIDN'T. BASED ON THEIR EXISTING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND GAP ANALYSIS THAT THEY'VE CONDUCTED IN EVEN ADDITIONAL I RELATED TO THESE PRIORITIES WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO UTILIZE THOSE SIGNS AND- FOR pABSOLUTE AGAIN AS I MENTIONED. YOUTH AT AND TWENTY FIVE OR IN THE PARTY POPULATION AS OUR SENIORS WE ARE AT PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY FOR THE REGIONAL MINISTERS SYSTEM WE PROPOSED TO US WHERE THEY WHERE THEY BUT WE HAVE STATE DID A LOOK. PRIOR IS WITHIN THAT. I THINK THE OTHER PIECE OF. TO STABILIZING- THE ADULT SENIOR CARE FACILITIES IS REALLY AT AND TO YOUR POINT SENATOR NEEDING TO HAVE A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES AT FOUR. OF OUR SENIORS AS THE AGENTS OR WHETHER WE CAN SUPPORT THEM EIGHTEEN IN PLACE IN THEIR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THROUGH OUR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM OR WHETHER THEY NEED ADDITIONAL CARE AND SUPPORTS THREE TWENTY FOUR HOUR AND RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM LIKE OUR ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES ARE OUR RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THAT. THE IDEAS THAT BECKONED I'M IS THERE AND SO THE DAY THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO STABILIZE WOULD HELP ACTUALLY CREATE RENTAL AGREEMENTS TO ENSURE PARTICULARLY WE- HAD THE- IN YOUR CENTER EXERCISES. RECIPIENTS THAT HAVE SINCE THE- IN THOSE CARE SET. IT IS. THIS SOMETHING THAT SAYS BEING ADVOCATED. ON BEHALF OF SENIORS AGAIN WE'VE GOT OUR STUDENTS THEY'VE GOT GREAT ADVOCACY WITH OUR- UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS AND WHAT HAVE YOU- BUT SENIORS TEND TO BE- YOU KNOW THEY THEY VOTE. SO THAT'S A VOICE- AND IN GREAT NUMBERS BUT- IS FOR. WHO TO LOOK WHO WHO IS GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNT. TO MAKE SURE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW. AND WHERE. OUR PURSUIT HERE. THAT WE ACTUALLY HOLD OUR STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING A LOT OF THE- YOU KNOW CREATING A HOUSING AND SO FORTH ARE ALSO. WORKING TOWARDS THAT COMMITMENT TO WHO IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. YES THE MAYBE TAKING IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND THEN GETTING MORE SPECIFIC TO THE QUESTION OR OTHER THINGS THAT WERE WERE WORKING WITH PERFECTLY ON THE HOUSE I WAS LOOKING AT AND A HALF HALF FUNDING APPLICATIONS IS ON WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS SET IN THEIR GOALS TO BE AND IS THE COMMUNITY SEE. THEIR NAME WHERE IS. YOU SEE IT. A GAS AND HELP. UNDERSTOOD UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT AND WHERE THEY BELIEVE THE FUNDING SHOULD BE TARGETED BECAUSE I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE A VERY BIG STATE AND IN SOME IN SOME OF THIS THERE IS MUCH HIGHER UP MERCY'S SOME PART OF THE STATE THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER PRICE% FIRST HOMELESSNESS. TRYING READ THE FINE LADIES PLEASE CAN. NEEDS WHERE THAT UP HOLDING THEM A- IS. DOES YOUR GAP ANALYSIS MAKES SENSE DOES YOUR DOES THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR FUNDING FIT WITH WHAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AS WHERE YOU HAVE GUESTS AND THEY'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT AT COMMUNITY COMMUNITY GAPS ANALYSIS I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND TRYING TO HELP THEM THIS SORT OF GOES AND WHERE THE HOME IS EIGHT AND CONSISTS WILL BE VERY HELPFUL AS ME IS LOOK AT THEIR OWN DATA AND SEE WHAT. WHERE THINGS ARE HEADING DOWN HOW THEY STOP THAT COME. I'M TRYING TO THINK THAT. BUT THAT SUMMIT IN ALL. JUST ISN'T THERE. REALLY GOOD DAY. THROUGHOUT THE STATE HELPING THEM ON WHETHER SEEMS THEN SHIFT FUNDING AFTER A I WOULD THEY WERE TRYING TO TAKE UP A BIT OF A BROADER APPROACH OF. COMMITTEES ARE ABLE TO SEE WHAT WEATHER BUT THERE ARE AND THEN HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO MEETING THOSE NEEDS. SO JUST WANT TO ADD. GIVE A LITTLE FRIENDLY REMINDER THAT WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT. THAT DIRECTOR HERE DOCTOR JOHNSON MAKES IT IN TIME FOR HER HEARING- WITH THAT SAID WE HAVE TWO MORE SPEAKERS THOSE. PAN AND I. SENATOR THERE AFTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. COUPLE FOR A FEW QUESTIONS HERE NAY NO WILL DELVE MORE INTO SPECIFICS SO WHEN- YOU PRESENT FOR THE RESPECTIVE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES- BUT THIS. ONE ONE QUESTION IS LIKE SO WE HAVE. IN THE BACKGROUND THE OF FIVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OVERSEEN BY I THINK- FARMER SO SERVICES RELATED TO. HOMELESSNESS I KNOW THAT- BUT SUBCOMMITTEE HEARD ABOUT- WITH AGING ABOUT HOME SAFE AT THE HAVE WE DONE A GAP ANALYSIS ABOUT OKAY THESE FIVE. BETWEEN TAX SO FOR THEM TALK ABOUT SENIOR. APPLIES TO PEOPLE SUFFERING ABUSE OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS BUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE HAVING A SPOUSE DIED NOW HE SUDDENLY YOUR LOSS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INCOME FALLS UNDER THAT AND THEN THAT. HELPS RAISE FUNDS THINKING LIKE. WHERE THERE'S GAS. I THINK RELATES SPECIAL TO THE OTHER AND EIGHT SPECTRUM TERMS TO ITEM ON OF FACTLY FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE COME MEET WITH ME AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR OWN THE STUDENT. AND NEARLY SAID WELL CAN THERE BE A SONG AND I SAID OH BY THE WAY WHAT'S THE PRESENCE OF SOCIAL SERVICES ON CAMPUS. THE WHAT. WENT WELL BECAUSE I MEAN WITH HAVE. PROGRAMS FOR HOMELESSNESS STRAIGHT AND WHAT THEIR DUTY TO CREATE A SEPARATE POOL FOR THE STUDENTS OR DO WE MAKE. THE SERVICE AVAILABLE WHERE THE- STUDENTS ACTUALLY FAR AND THAT DILUTES SLICE OF THE POPULATION SO CAN YOU. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THIS GREAT. CAN ACCESS THE- NOT WHERE THE- PROGRAMS. ARE WHERE THEY'RE AT SO THEY HAVE TO GO FIND THEM. SO TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION SENATOR RELATED TO PROJECTIONS I THINK- OTHER PIECE THAT WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INTO COMMITTEES IS THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING EFFORT AND THAT IS WHERE WE'RE HEARING FROM. MANY SENIORS IN MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES AROUND THE NEW WELL OKAY YEAH I GOT I GOT THAT RIGHT I WAS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. WE'RE LOOKING AT JACK'S DIFFERENT OF MANY. TYPE AND I THINK THAT KIND OF THE THAT WE'VE BEEN TAKING TO DATE HAS BEEN ALLOWING EITHER THE COUNTY OR THEIR OR THEY'RE AND CASE THAT HERE WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING THE REGION TO IDENTIFY WITH THEIR GAPS WHETHER YES ENTERS AN OVERALL NEED AT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE USED FOR MANY TYPES OF. YEAH AND. PROGRAMS FOOD TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T FIT IN ANY OF THOSE FIVE TO HALF OF THIS PRODUCT IS WE'VE CREATED. FIVE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. RATE AND ARE WE LOOKING AT WELL. WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH DIDN'T FIT IN NOW THE FIVE THEY HAVE LIKE FIVE CIRCLE SOME MAY OVERLAP SOME MAY NOT AND FOUR LEVELS IN BETWEEN. YES SOMEWHERE. IN BETWEEN I THINK THAT IS WHAT DAY THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND KEEP AND THE SIX ARE FIFTY MILLION SHARES IN HALF- WHICH ARE BROUGHT PROGRAMS. THAT CAN BE USED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS FOR MANY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS I THINK THAT THE UNIQUE PIECE AND I SPEAK FOR CAN BUT THE- EIGHT PIECE FOR C. S. OF PROGRAMS IS THAT THEY'RE- IN. BUT IT'S POPULATION. NINE TEST. WORK KEEP IN THE HOT FIVE. IS REALLY INTO. BE FOR THE FOR COMMITTEE WHERE. THE THESE SORT OF INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE ARE NOT ADDRESSING THE REST OF THE POPULATION TO SIMILAR TO WHAT. HIDE IS GIVING OUT TO CONTINUE. THROUGH SG AND OTHER SORT OF HAD FUNDING I THINK THOSE ARE WHERE THEY'RE- BE USE THAT FOR ANY POPULATION THAT EXPERIENCE. HOMELESSNESS AND BEING ABLE TO BE USED AS A- NEED THEM. WHERE THEY IT AND WHICH CASE. THAT LEAVES. QUESTION BE SURE TO. PEOPLE THE FIRE PROGRAM. THAT FROM. EIGHT OUR OUR- WHERE THEY RESIDE USING A PLACE TO RESIDE BUT WHERE THEY AT LEAST SEND A TIE I THERE'S YOU KNOW IT. AFTER AND REESE WE WANT TO DO TO MAKE SURE THIS CONNECTS ARE MADE HOW IN. ARE ENGAGING ACCOUNT IN PER THE SEARCH BERRIES ACROSS STATE INCOME OF THE RESTORE AVAILABLE TO DO THAT AT REACH I WILL SAY SPECIFIC. ENTER FOOD AND CAL STAR FOCUS OF OURS AND LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT THE STUDENT HUNGRY SHE'S NOT A BAD STICKLE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT DEVELOPING SOME PRIORITIES AND THAT AT THAT THAT WILL BE FORTHCOMING BUT- ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR KEEP. YOUR CONNECT THE SERVICE AND MAKE THE OUT POSTED TO SO WE START THAT TO ENTER. WHAT CAN. FOR SORT. I THINK THAT DOUBLE WE WANT IS FOR OUT HOW. THE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS TO THE FEEL NOT JUST SITTING ONE OFF AND OUT AND SO THAT THEY CAN HELP THE YOUR THE EVERYONE HAVE TO FIND A WAY AND THEY ACTUALLY CAN PROVIDE THE BROAD ARRAY OF SOCIAL SERVICE. NOT JUST LIKE A WELL ON JUST HOW FRESH SO. PACKED TO THE US FIND SOMEONE ELSE IN THE OFFICE FOR THE NEXT THING RIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER. QUESTION I HAD WAS. TO TALK ABOUT. AND I'M SURE WE'LL DELVE INTO MUCH MORE DETAIL LATER TERMS OF THE SEVEN FIFTY MILLION THAT DIDN'T PROPOSED AND IT'S GOING TO REGIONAL MINISTERS I KNOW THERE'S SOME BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THAT. BUT I GUESS ONE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS IS THAT. HOWEVER WHOEVER DOES IT TO ME YES SOMEONE. HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND ON QUOTE PLANNING IN IDENTIFYING WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE FOR EACH REGION AND HOW MUCH AND WONDERING IF I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. RIGHT SO A CELL AT A REAL WE WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON WISELY SO WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THIS BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED. WE'RE AT. DOING A LOT OF PLANNING PLANET. THE ARE SAYING WHEN WE GOT TO SOMETHING. PROBLEMS CAN WE CAN YOU SPEAK TO PRESS A LITTLE BIT THAT TIME LINE THEIR MUSIC REGIONAL MINISTERS ARE THEY EXPECTED TO NOW DO A PLANNING DOCUMENT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SIX. NINE MONTHS A YEAR THAT THAT OR THE MONEY. OUT OF BLOOD. HE PLAN IS OUT. TO ADDRESS THEIR- OF ISSUE SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO ACTUALLY RELEASE THE REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS OUT TO REGIONAL MINISTRY THERE'S WITHIN THE COMING MONTHS COMING WEEKS EVEN AT THIS POINT. I GIVING AT SOME TIME FOR RESPONSE I MEAN THE IDEA IS THAT THESE THIS IS BUILDING UPON EXISTING PLANETS HAVE AS A CLASS THAT. HEARD REALLY WANTING THAT LEVERAGE POINT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PLANNING EFFORTS TO THE KURDS HOW WE ARE PROPOSED. HE WOULD HAVE AS THE ENTIRE PROCESS WITH A REVIEW OF THOSE PROPOSALS. I HAD DONE IN TIME SO THAT ANSWERS THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED THIS SUMMER WE COULD RELEASE DOLLARS. WHY AND MY BE BLOOM DELTA A NASCENT DISCUSS OF ABOUT EXACTLY IS IN APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO. WHO HAS INFORMATION ABOUT THE- WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TOO MANY MISTAKES STAFF AND MOST MAKE EFFECTIVE USE THOSE FUNDS SO ARTS OKAY. THANK YOU. SENATOR BAIT. THANK YOU I KNOW TIME IS ON PRESSING AND I'M GOING TO SEE.

HASN'T DOWN THE RIGHT MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT IS. FUTURE HERE BECAUSE YOU ARE SIT STANDARDS ACCOUNT ANY STANDARDS PERFECT MATCH AS YOU. TO BE. YEAH NOT ANYTHING BACK EXCEPT FOR MARK. IT'S GETTING THERE SOME YOU DOING ABOUT IT SO BECAUSE IS SHORT JUST GOING TO ASK ARE YOU TO A FULL ON THAT AND MAYBE THAT IN TO US INTO INC I THINK OUR OUR CITIZENS OUR STATE YOU AND SAW EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT WE ARE MAKING A- IN THIS PROBLEM AND I WILL SHARE ALLOW. I WILL WHAT BERMAN. YEAH BEING AND AT THAT LOS WE DO WE TOOK THE A TO THIS PRO OUT AND PUT IT WITH SSI WE HAD A TO THE DISABLED THE TRACK THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE HAD GO PUBLISHED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE. DENOMINATOR THE HOMELESS PROBLEM. TODAY SO MAYBE IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO BRING SOME OF THAT BACK INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WE HAVE CASE WORKERS. DIRECTLY A FINE TO THOSE PROBLEM AREAS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. THE MOST VULNERABLE AND SUFFERING CLUE OUR STUDENTS ARE YOU POPULATION A NUMBER OF THOSE COMING AND WHEN I WAS A SOCIAL BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT THE- TO THE- OF CHOICE THE- FAMILY.

WHEN I PUT THE CLOTHES LITTLE TO CLOSE. TO PERFECT GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR WELCOMING HERE AT MY NAME ISN'T AN AGENDA OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE UCSF BENIOFF HOMES AND HOUSING INITIATIVE IT'S A NEW RESEARCH AND POLICY CENTER AT UCSF. THE COMMITTEES HERE FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT. WHICH ARE THE MOST URGENT. IS WE HAVE OF UCSF I'M REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU. THE WHAT IS ACTUALLY WORKING TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS AND WHAT STRATEGIES CALIFORNIA SHOULD DOUBLE DOWN ON- WHILE THE UCSF INITIATIVE IS NEW I HAVE WORKED IN THIS FIELD FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS- MOST RECENTLY AT THE NATIONAL LINES TEN HOMELESSNESS AND AS A FIELD. WE DO KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKS- AND THAT'S HAPPENING OUTSIDE. OF CALIFORNIA ANOTHER COUNTRIES BUT REALLY IT'S THERE'S PLENTY OF THINGS THAT ARE WORKING IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M GONNA SPEND SOMETIME HIGHLIGHTING THAT AS WELL. IN THE NATION IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY STATES HAD INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS BUT ABOUT THIRTY STATES SHOWED YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASES. AND ALMOST AS AN ALMOST EVERY SUBPOPULATION FAMILIES VETERANS PEOPLE ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS YOUTH- AND IN VERY EXPENSIVE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SO NOT JUST- PLACES THAT ARE NOT COMPARABLE. TO US TO CALIFORNIA PLACES LIKE DC. AND OUTSIDE OF BRIDE REALLY EXPENSIVE PARTS OF VIRGINIA. AND IT'S ABOUT HAVING THE POLITICAL WILL THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY WORKING THE ONGOING. SIZEABLE THANKS FOR A MEDIA. CENTER TALK ABOUT JOSH. I'M RESPONSE THE EVIDENCE BASED EMERGENCY AND LONG TERM PERMANENT HOUSING. IF FUND INTERMENT VISITED BUT WORK THAT'S REALLY MORTENSEN JUST LET GOOD ON TOP OF BAD. I'M REALLY OUT. CREATING ACCOUNT IN BETWEEN AT AND REALLY PERFORMANCE OUTCOME MEASURES THAT YOU'RE REALLY TRACKING AND LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO DO HERE AND SEVERAL PROGRAMS. AND CREATE EARLY ACCESS TO AND COORDINATION BETWEEN SYSTEMS OF CARE SO IT CAN'T JUST PHAM HOMELESS SYSTEM AS WE HAVE I THINK TALKED ABOUT TODAY. AND REALLY THE DOESN'T ALLOW. OF PROVIDERS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AT SCALE- TO MATCH THE GROWING. IN A LOT FUNDING INTO UNITIES WAS THAT A LOT THE VETERANS INITIATIVE TO END VETERAN HOMELESSNESS PRINT OUT OF FUNDING COMMUNITIES IS OFTEN NOT ENOUGH IT'S COORDINATION BETWEEN SYSTEMS. IT'S BUILDING THE CAPACITY TO DO IT IT'S POLITICAL WELL THOSE ARE THINGS THAT REALLY- BECAUSE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES. YES THE DESPITE THE TROUBLING TREND LINES RECENTLY GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION WITH HOMES IS IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA IS EMPLOYING MANY OF. THEIR WORKING ELSE. AND IT'S A- STATE HERE WILL ALSO. THE NATION IT. DURATION PROVED TO BE. AND VERY EXPENSIVE PARTS OF THIS. ONLY A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE. HARD WORK AND STRATEGIC THINKING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND IN MANY LOOK. US REALLY WE SEE A BABY MOVEMENT THE LAST FEW YEARS. SO WE WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- THE THINGS THAT THE STATE'S EFFORTS AND MANY COMMUTERS IN CALIFORNIA FOR LEADING THE COUNTRY IN VARIOUS INNOVATIONS INTERVENTIONS ARE SUCH AS MAKING HOUSE. FIRST STATUTORY CRIME FOR MANY PROGRAMS THAT HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. OF INFLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOLS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE AND SORT. ABOUT USING THE SEVEN MILLION TO DO OF THAT I CAN TALK TO. ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT WHOLE PERSON CARE TO BRING IN THE SYSTEMS OF CARE TOGETHER- AND USING SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS LIKE HOW IT WORKS IN THE ONE AND HOME SAFE THE ONES WE JUST HEARD ABOUT. PROVIDING PEOPLE ARE COMING THAT'S RIGHT SIDES. HALL OF. IT BEING A ALREADY INCOMES. AND SERVICES TO HOUSE STEAKHOUSE. MORE WE INCREASES. AS THAT MAKE. FIFTEEN PEOPLE SO NOT TO SERVE AN EMERGENCY ROOM EMERGENCY RESPONSE BUT LINKING HOMELESS TO HOUSING- THE MORE WE CAN MEET YOUR HOMES IS. WHERE IF. THIS HOUSE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THE STATE- AND WE THANK THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR A REAL INVESTMENT COMMITTEE BEHIND THIS. AS I AM AND NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN HOMES AND CAL HAS. FROM HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND ON FIFTY THAT PAST DECADE I AT ON THE BEACH POURTANT CETTE 2% ARE ON FOSTER. CORD UNACCEPTABLE I AND WHAT IT IS A SEEMINGLY OF SEVEN TO THE PUBLIC IN A- CA PEOPLE TO SAY WILL DON'T KNOW WRONG BUT WE'RE SEEING. COMPORT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT WHAT WE SEE IS NOT REALLY A LINE WHAT WE WILL WE KNOW AND SO THE VISIBILITY OF THE ISSUE ALSO CAUSES A LOT OF TENSION- BUT HOWEVER EVEN WITH THESE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN FAMILY HOMELESSNESS AND FEDERAL HOMELESSNESS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S THANKS TO INVESTMENT IN PROVING HOUSING FIRST PROGRAMS LIKE RAPIDLY HOUSING AND PERMITS PART OF HOUSING THAT HAVE COME THROUGH CAL WORKS. AND OTHER AND THE AND THE VA AND OTHER- FUNDING PROGRAMS FEDERAL AND STATE AND LOCAL THAT ARE BEING ASKED TO DELIVER OUTCOMES AND REALLY USE EVIDENCE. INTERVENTIONS REALLY DECREASED-% HOME ASSISTANCE CERTAIN POPULATIONS HERE AND DECREASED OVERALL SYSTEM COMMUNITIES ARE KIND. AT. WE'RE INVESTING WHAT WE KNOW WORKS. HOUSING FIRST. NOT JUST PUTTING HER PART OF HOUSE WHICH IS NEED BUT IT'S A VERY INTENSIVE AND- IS NEEDED FOR I'VE- THE SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE POPULATION- AND EXPANDING HEALTH HOUSING IN INCOME SUPPORTS. NONE OF THIS I THINK IS- IS NEW BUT HAVING HOMELESS SYSTEM LEADERS AND PROVIDERS THAT ARE. SMARTLY NAVIGATING THE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MARKET THAT YOU HAVE HERE- YES HOUSING FIRST IS THAT IS A MARKET BASED SOLUTION AND SO WE HAVE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT ARE FIGURING OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT MARKET. THAT IS CURRENTLY EXISTING AND HOW THOUSAND OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE EVERY DAY. I THAT'S- FOR POLICY DECISIONS AT LOCAL AND LEVEL. IN EVIDENCE BASED BRANCHES BUT REALLY ALSO WORKING AT. ACROSS I IS AND- SO. THE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT ARE RE MAKING DENSE ARE THE PAY THAT ARE A TO WORK OUTSIDE IS VERY SO. FIND SYSTEM OTHER COMMUNITIES SEVEN HISTORY PLEASE UP. AND IT'S JUST A FEW COMMITTEES IS FOR COMMUNITY SEVEN RECOGNIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AS ENDING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS FUNCTIONALLY AND THREE STATES AND SEVENTY EIGHT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ENDED VETERAN HOMELESSNESS AGAIN REALLY PIECING THE SAME TYPES INTERPLAY I IN- EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS- BETTER SORT OF THINKING SHORT TERM TREE ARE STRATEGIES AS WELL AS LONG I'M HOUSING STRATEGIES. I WOULD REVISIT WHY PEOPLE. MUST BECAUSE THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT. BY THE THINGS IMPORTANT DATA TO INFORM THE- WE HAVE. WELL THERE PEOPLE I'M HOME IF YOU WAS THIS LAW THERE HOUSING DUE TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS NO THAT THROUGH A OF THE DATA SO WYRM PEOPLE FALL TO HOMES AND CAL MORE SO THAN OTHER STAY. ANSWERS BUT OBVIOUS BECAUSE EVERY DAY MORE IN PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD HOW AND HOME SYSTEM CAN HOUSE AT THE SAME RATE THAT PEOPLE ARE BECOMING HOMELESS AND THAT'S WHY THE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP HERE AT THE CAUSES OF HOMELESS YES NOT ALL TO. US THIS PRICES CAUSED BY GATES OF IT IS LOCALS FOR WHICH IS IN A HOUSING SEVERE BRADFORD INSTITUTIONALIZE THAT INSTEAD SYSTEM RACISM THE ME AND HOMES AS AS THE IN MISMATCH COST HOUSING PEOPLE. RENTS ARE RISING. PUTTING WHENEVER WE CAN THE REPORT INJURY BEST SAID THE REAL ESTATE PRICES OF RESIDENTS TIMES FOR THAN HOW AND- AT MORE THAN HALF. OF STATE'S HOUSE HOW OF THE STATE JUST ACROSS THE STATE AFFORD THE HOUSE THE COST OF HOUSING. TO THE PAYING MORE THAN THIRTY PER OF THEIR IN MANY OVER FIFTY THE 7% THESE RICH DIMENSION TO THIS THE CHOI CENTER FOR HOUSING SO AT HEART POINTS THAT NATIONALLY BLACK PRINTER. AT AND HAVE HIGHEST RUN BURDEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN WITH 55% OF PEOPLE PAY MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME FOR HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA BLACK PEOPLE EXPERIENCE INCOMES ARE FAR OF REPRESENTED AS WE HEARD EARLIER. MAKING UP ONLY 7% STAYS IN OUR POPULATION 229% OF THE STATE'S HOMES POPULATION. OUR RESEARCH PAPER VERY TO SHALL AT UCSF ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DISCRIMINATION EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE PREMATURE. WITH A FAMILY OF ALL FACTORS STRUCTURE RACES THAT IF. PEOPLE'S TO THE COW AND IT'S A ALSO THE MOST ARE WORKING BEFORE THE BECAME HOME. BOB AND MANY ARE WORKING WHILE THEY ARE HOMELESS THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LET FOUND THAT A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE 74% OF PEOPLE LOS ANGELES. WHO WROTE TO RECEIVE HOME SERVICES BETWEEN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAD WORKED IN CALIFORNIA. AND SOMEONE THAT THANK HAD. MEANT THE THIS ABOUT PEOPLE FALLING TO HOME IS FOR THE FIRST TIME OVER AGE OF FIFTY AND AS- THE FOR FIRST TIME AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE FELL IN BECAUSE OF HEALTH OR- A- THAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN TASK. LABOR MARKET BUT NOW ARE JUST ABLE TO THEIR HOUSING FOR PRESS REASONS. ADDITIONAL CALLS FACTORS RB IN FOR. PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTY WRITTEN FOR THEM SO OF COURSE HOW PROBLEMS ARE THE BECAUSE NUMBERS. BUT THE LESS SAFETY THE LESS A SAFE NET A PERSON HAS THE MORE THESE IN. BONE OF THE REALLY CONTRIBUTE TO HOMELESSNESS. THE BILL PLAY IN THE WORLD RATES OF HOMELESS. HAVE A BIGGER AND BROADER SAFETY AS MANY P. STRUCK TO MAKE. THERE'S ABLE. TO THAT. NOT WAITING TO FALL INTO. YOUR LOOK AT HOW YOU'RE MONEY. TO RENT MAYBE IT'S ONE TIME IS A- MAYBE IT'S ONGOING. BUT THE ASSISTANCE IS THERE. ON THE SITUATION IS MORE DIE HERE BY THE CALL OF LIVING. LACK OF EXTREMELY LOAN HOUSING. AND THE LACK OF US THAT OVER A REAL SORT OF A ROBUST SAFETY NET AND- I ALWAYS LIKE TO SORT OF REMEMBER THAT PRIOR TO THE EIGHTIES WE DIDN'T HAVE. SPUR HOME AS WE HAD. WE DID HAVE LOWER. DORIS WE HAD OF. THING IN HAD NO YET STARTED TO. SHRUG THE SAY THAT. OUGHT TO AND WE BUILDING. AND REALLY WHERE THE X. OF HOW HAPPEN. SO HOME HAPPENED. THOUGH THE DEATH PICTURES DIRE THE ARE. NOW IS SIX. AS WEAK CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE STATE. FREE WITH THE RIGHT POLICIES SYSTEM AND COURTNEY VISION ACROSS EACH. WE UNDO THESE A FAX BUT IT DOES TAKE A LONG TERM ANSWER POLITICAL COMMITMENT. ALWAYS OF SYSTEMS AND HOW POWER IS AN ON GOING FUNDING AND LOOKING NOW AT WE'RE DOING ABOUT HOME AS WELL IS WORKING WHAT ISN'T. WE NEED TO SHOW TERM FOR. AT A LONG TERM HOUSING STRATEGY AS WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT TODAY WE KNOW THAT AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE INCLUDES THESE COMPONENTS THAT USE A HOUSING. APPROACH AND ARE PART OF A COORDINATED SYSTEMIC VISION AND RESPONSE RATHER THAN A COLLECTION OF SILENT FUNDING- AND WE SEE A LOT OF THESE CONS REFLECTED IN THE PARTY'S OF THE NEW SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO THE THREE PARTS WE REALLY TALK ABOUT ME WE ARE AN EMERGENCY CRISIS RESPONSE ADEQUATE PEOPLE ABOUT TO FALL INTO ALMOST NYSSA TRYING TO FOR. THAT WE TO GET THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE WE HAVE TO GET TO FOLKS FASTER WE CAN'T AT STREET FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT TO FALL NECKLACES AND FOR PEOPLE WERE LIVING ON THE STREET. AND SOMETIMES YES IT'S JUST A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF THE STREET FOR KEEP GETS PEOPLE RIGHT BACK IN THE HOUSING- AND SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LAW VERY INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS- WE NEED ADEQUATE AND REFLECT. ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR MULTIPLE SYSTEMS HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH AND- TO GET PEOPLE HOUSE THREE HOUSES QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE CURRENT HOUSING MARKETS NAVIGATING THAT CURRENT HOUSING MARKET. DATE HOUSE AGAIN THIS CAN RANGE FROM WHITE LET'S DISTANCE. MORE INTENSIVE IN A LIKE PROM PART OF HOUSING AND ALL HELPING AS- CARE FACILITIES FOR. OR THOSE OF SUCH THIS. MAYBE EVEN FOR. OF COURSE MANY SERIOUS FIVE EXTREME ON HOUSING AND REAL HOUSING AT ALL FOR WITH THE MORE RESEARCH PUSHING ON THE RUN MARKET THE MORE AT THE LESS AVAILABLE THERE FOR PEOPLE IN THE BY. OTHERS COMMUNITY OF CALIFORNIA I'M YOU KNOW WE'RE HOUSING FOR JUST YOU A DIFFICULT HOUSING WORSE THAT HAPPEN YOU AND PLACES ALSO WHO OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LAW TWO YEARS THERE'S MORE AND MORE PEOPLE FOR IN HOUSING BUT HOW FIRST IS WORKING WE JUST OF HAPPENS UP AND GET PEOPLE. I WANTED TO SPEAK HOUSE FIRST IS NOT ONLY THIS SORT OF NUMBER OF. THE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PROMISE IN ON RECENT. BUT CHARACTERIZES HOUSING. AND THAT IS NOT AND THEN INCREASE ON CHILDREN. THOSE HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE IN THOSE HAVE TO BE ACCESSIBLE BUT THOSE ARE PART OF THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL- NEWER STRATEGIES THAT ARE SHOWING GREAT PROMISE ELSEWHERE ARE. VERY COST EFFECTIVE ARE STARTING TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS SO WE CALL THEM DIVERSION HERE PROBLEM SOLVING IN CALIFORNIA. IN TRYING TO GET TO PEOPLE BEFORE THEY FALL IN THIS ORDER. WORK WITH NEWLY HOMELESS PEOPLE TO GET THEM OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- AND IN THE SHORT RUN WE SHOULD KEEP TRYING TO IMPROVE THE UNDER FUNDED EMERGENCY HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. SO THAT INCLUDES EMERGENCY SHELTER SWITCHER GENERALLY KIND OF UNDER FUNDED AND NOT DESIGNED- TO REALLY HOUSE PEOPLE BUT BY FUNDING THEM TO HAVE MORE CAPACITY CAPACITY AND MAKE THEM PART OF THE HOUSING SYSTEM RATHER THAN A FINAL DESTINATION SO WE OFTEN THINK. THERE'S A BUNCH OF ONE SOLDIER PEOPLE IF WE JUST BUILD SOME SHELTERS AND HENCE WE CAN GET THEM OFF THE STREET BUT WITHOUT ANY HOUSING AT THE STRATEGY. WE DON'T HAVE EVERY TEMPORARY BED ATTACHED TO HOUSING OR SOME HOUSING RESOURCE- YOU'RE JUST GONNA SORT OF END UP BUILDING MORE SHELTERS. PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE FILLING THOSE UP AND IT WILL SORT OF REALLY- JUST AS A COMPOUND THE ISSUE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY TO GET. OUT SO YOU WERE IN.COMMUNITY YES THE LOCAL TO SHOW IMPACT AND GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS BUT FEEL LIKE. SALT WHILE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS OUR OF HOLDING AT THE CENTER. OF EVERY THAT HOUSING SOLVE ALMOST AS- IN A RELEASE THE NOT MATCH. ENDED UP. I PEOPLE TO PEOPLE PASSED SPECIAL POOR JOB OF THAT AS A SAID WITH ON FOR AND WE HOUSING PEOPLE MUCH MORE AND OF SO THAT INCLUDES LIKE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES SHALLOW SUBSIDIES TRYING NEW STRATEGIES LIKE ADDING RENTAL ASSISTANCE EXISTING INCOME SUPPORTS LIKE CAL WORKS HAS DONE THIS CAN BE DONE FOR PEOPLE EXTREMELY HIGH RENT BURNS ASSET BY ITSELF- AND EXPERIMENTING WITH THOSE TIME THE SHELLS SUBSIDIES SO STOP THERE AND- TRIP QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- BECAUSE OF THEIR ANY QUESTIONS YES CENTER JACKSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS A WEALTH OF INFORMATION- OF COULD YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU YOU FEEL THAT WE NEED TO. WORK OUTSIDE CURRENT FUNDING SOURCES- WHICH I THINK IS CRITICAL AND TO CUTTING INTEGRATED FROM PROGRAM SO LAST ONE PARTICULARLY STRUCK ME YOU HAVE YOUR- LOW INCOME FOLKS WHO ARE ALREADY ON CAL WORKS A PROGRAMS THE FACT WE HAVE BEEN ADDED- HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO. TO THEIR YOU KNOW TO THE QUESTIONERS IF YOU WILLOR OR THEIR NEED SETTLEMENTS OR ASSISTANCE IS KIND OF MIND BOGGLING BUT THAT BRINGS ME TO THE QUESTION. WE HAVE A BUREAUCRACY. AND IT SEEMS TO ME LISTEN TO EVERYONE IS TALKED OUR DEBRIS ARE THE BUREAUCRACY AND ITS LIMITATIONS AND EVERYONE IS IN THEIR SILO HAS MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS WHAT IS A MUCH MORE HOLISTIC ISSUE. DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE COULD- PERHAPS. CREATE GREATER FLEXIBILITY OR CHANGE THE- AFTER OF THESE BUREAUCRACY SO THAT THEY ARE MORE WE'RE- TO THE COMPLEX AND SOMETIMES INTEGRATED ISSUES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ARE HOMELESS POPULATION. YES THERE IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE AND IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE DIFFERENT LOCALITIES AND AGENCIES BUT THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POEM ON LOS ANGELES WHICH I THINK PEOPLE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE REASON IT'S QUITE EFFECTIVE IS BECAUSE WHILE IT IS RUN THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES THERE. IT REALLY STREAMLINES DIFFERENT TYPES FUNDS TAKING FUNDING FROM THE HOUSING BUT AS FOR THE HOUSING AUTHORITY FROM JUST IN THE OFFICE THE VERSION REENTRY FROM. CARE FROM HELPS. FOR ME AND IT'SPUTTING. A LOT OF FUNDING SOURCES TOGETHER INTO ONE POT AND KIND OF STREAMLINE THE CONTRACTING TO ONE OR TWO OPERATORS WHO THEN FIND HOUSING AND WORK WITH SEVERAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. BUT BY STREAMLINING THAT CONTRACTING ELIGIBILITY PROCESS AND HAVING JUST A FEW ENTITIES SORT OF REALLY- CONTROL SORT OF DELIVERING THE SERVICES AND FIGURE OUT WHAT PEOPLE NEED THEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO THAT. IN ORDER TO COMEY THAT OPERATOR AND SAY. THESE ARE MY- NEED AND NOT OPERATED SAY WELL SIGNING UP FOR THE PROGRAM SIGNING UP FOR THAT PROGRAM AND YOU HAVE TO GO OVER HERE FOR YOUR SERVICES. INSTEAD KIND OF PACKAGING THE SERVICES INDIVIDUALLY FOR THE HOUSING AND SERVICE BUT THE HEALTH SERVICES FOR PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT MAKES THERE. ABILITY NAVIGATE ALL THESE THINGS MUCH MORE. MUCH MORE MUCH MORE VASSELIN ALSO ABLE TO GET THEIR NEEDS BUT MUCH MORE QUICKLY RIGHT TO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TWENTY DIFFERENT PLACES ARE NOT TRYING TO CHECK OUT. BOXES PLEASE STREAMLINING ELIGIBILITY IN A WAY BETWEEN SEVERAL FUNDING STREAM. THAT WOULD HELP CORD. WHAT NEEDS TO A SORT OF READ OR AT LEAST STAND UP HOMELESSNESS SO THAT'S ON THE LOCAL LEVEL THE STATE WE HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES THEY'VE GOT KIND OF THEIR OWN WAY OF DOING THINGS- IT IT TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS THERE SOMETHING AS SOME KIND OF PROGRAM OR OR FUNCTION SHOULD SAY OR NEW AGENCY OR EFFORT THAT'S BEING MADE ON THE STATE LEVEL TO SORT OF. MOVE THOSE WAS. IF SO WHAT ARE THEY IN IT NOT WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IT DOES SOUND IN THE LAST- IN THE LAST YEAR TOO ESPECIALLY THAT THE VARIOUS AGENCIES ESPECIALLY- AND HELPING HIM SERVICES. AND DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AT T. ARE SORT OF WORKING TOGETHER IN A MUCH MORE COORDINATED WAY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE FUNDING IN BE BRAIDED AND BLENDED. LOCALLY AND I THINK THE NEW SEVEN OR FIFTY DOLLARS AS A MATTER OF TWO MILLION- DOLLAR FUND IS REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT HAD. HAVE LOCALITIES HELP READ AND BLOOM THAT FUNDING. OF THIS COMING FROM IS DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES- THERE ARE YOU KNOW OTHER STATES HAVE. THE THINGS LIKE. INTERAGENCY COUNCIL HOMELESS. I'VE NEVER BEEN THEY'RE NOT REALLY ALWAYS THAT. USEFUL UNLESS THE AGES THEMSELVES ARE WILLING TO REALLY KIND OF. TAKE DOWN SOME OF THEIR- ELIGIBILITY ISSUES AND REALLY WORK TOGETHER SO THEY'RE ALL SEATED ON A COUNCIL DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN ANYTHING UNLESS THERE REALLY WEREN'T WILLING TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT. HOW TO STREAM LINE ELIGIBILITY IN FUNDING SO THAT PEOPLE CAN PORT MEET THEM MORE EASILY- AND THOUGH IT CROSS THE STATE I THINK. THE SORT OF STRATEGIC VISION THAT YOU'RE STARTING TO COME UP WITH- AT THAT YOU'RE SORT OF COME UP WITH THE STATE PLAN THAT'S VERY ACTION ORIENTED AND OUTCOMES ORIENTED. THAT'S REALLY TRYING TO PIECE ALL OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER SEEMS LIKE THE RIGHT DIRECTION- AND I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW IN RATHER THAN HAVING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POGRAMS THAT ARE BEING FOUGHT. FIGURING OUT HOW TO THESE TOGETHER IN A SYSTEMIC VERY JUST DO THE LOW THE SHORT TERM. MEDIUM TERM HELLO TERM FOR. ALL THESE PIECES. THERE AND- FIGURE. THE DIFFERENT. ISSUES WERE TO THE PATCH THE TOGETHER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE VERY HELPFUL PRESENTATION WE APPRECIATE A THANKS I THANK YOU FOR LINKING IT TO HOUSING PRODUCTION AS WELL. AS. OKAY WELL- OUR NEXT- PANEL. HI IS- HEARING FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO WILL SHARE- RESULTS EXPERIENCES AND BARRIERS TO COMBATING HOMELESSNESS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES- SO WE HAVE FIVE PANELISTS. FIVE ONE OKAY- FIVE I WANT TO WELCOME CONNIE BACK TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE HUMBLE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SERVICES I JERRY RAMIREZ WHO IS THE MANAGER OF HOMELESS INITIATIVE- FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE HI JODY CATCH SIDE WHO IS THE- DEPUTY REACHED. FOR CENTRAL. OUR CEO OF INTER COUNTY AND MATTHEW. IT'S CHOI STIR WHO IS THE DEPUTY CITY MY FOR MOVED ON I O I THINK WE'VE IN THE MAXIMO MAX MAX AND BY MINUTES EACH OF SO WE CAN YOU KNOW TOP OF THE LINE IF YOU AND YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT A LITTLE LESS THAN THAT THAT'S GREAT- I KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS SO THERE WILL BE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO ELABORATE OKAY SO- MIST IS BACK ARE YOU YES. THANK YOU YOU FOR. THANK YOU SET ASIDE CONNIE BACK HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTOR FOR HUMBOLDT COUNTY. AND LIKE ALL COUNTIES ARE REAL COMMUNITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS ALL START WITH WHAT'S WORKING WELL FOR OUR COUNTY IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE FLEXIBILITY OF HE FUNDING HELPED BRING MOBILE SHOWERS STARK COUNTY EXPAND OUT REGION EMPLOYMENT TRAINING AND IMPORTANTLY HELP STARK COUNTY BUILD STRONG STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR CITIES. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING ALLOWED US TO LAUNCH ARE HOMELESS MOBILE OUTREACH TEAM AND OUR LAND LORD SUPPORT PROGRAMS. THE SMALL COUNTY POOL FOR THE MHSAA NOPE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM MADE OUR APPLICATION MORE COMPETITIVE AND RESULTED IN TWENTY FIVE NEW UNITS FOR PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. COUNTIES APPRECIATE THE TARGETED HOUSING SUPPORT INVESTMENTS THE LEGISLATOR LET LEGISLATURE HAS MADE AND CAL WORKS ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES CHILD WELFARE AND SCOTT AND THE SMALL COUNTY WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAMS. THESE INVESTMENTS LEVERAGE WHAT COUNTIES DO WELL AND ARE HELPING US TO MEET A PORTION OF THE NEED. BY EACH OF THESE NEW FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES REQUIRES ITS OWN APPLICATION AND COMES WITH ITS OWN UNIQUE TARGET POPULATION RESTRICTIONS AN END DATE FOR GRANTS MAKING IT HARD TO PLAN FOR SUSTAINABILITY. ALIGNING APPLICATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ACROSS NEW PROGRAMS WOULD REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND ALLOW MORE SMALL AND RURAL COUNTIES TO PARTICIPATE. WHEN AN APPLICATION IS NOT NECESSARY SETTING MINIMUM DEDICATED ALLOCATIONS FOR SMALL COUNTIES IS VERY HELPFUL. WE MAY NOT BE SERVING THE SAME LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AS OUR URBAN COUNTERPARTS BUT IT TAKES MORE STAFF TIME AND LONGER TRAVEL TO REACH OUR REMOTE LOCATIONS. ONE OF OUR BIGGEST GAPS IN HOUSING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IS OLDER ADULTS WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES. WE'VE SEEN A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS LIVING HOMELESS ON OUR STREETS. HUMBLE IS PARTICIPATING IN THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES HOME SAFE GRANT AND IT HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS FOR OUR APS CLIENTS. EXPANDING AND SUSTAINING HOME SAFE WOULD BE A GOOD INVESTMENT. WE FOUND THAT MANY OF OUR ELDERS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WILL REQUIRE LONG TERM CASE MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONAL STATE INVESTMENT IN THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM WOULD HELP US MEET THIS GROWING NEED. WE PLAN TO USE TAP FUNDING TO HELP FILL THE HOUSE IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES GAP BUT THAT IS ONE TIME FUNDING BUILDING HOUSING NAVIGATION AND TENNESSEE SUPPORT AND TO THE MEDI CAL BENEFITS AS THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED IN THE STATE MEDICAID WAIVER AND JANUARY BUDGET. WILL BE A MORE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION. ROLL COUNTIES HAVE FEW LOCAL PLACEMENT OPTIONS FOR CONSERVE CLIENTS. OUR COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIAN WORKS CLOSELY ALONG SIDE WITH OUR APS AND MENTAL HEALTH TEAMS IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AS THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS CHANGING OR EXPANDING CONSERVATORSHIP NEW ONGOING INVESTMENT IN THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN WILL BE NECESSARY TO SERVE THIS VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION. BUILDING NEW HOUSING UNITS TAKES TIME ROLL COUNTIES HAD VERY FEW DEVELOPERS WITH THE EXPERTISE AND WILLINGNESS TO CONSTRUCT HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. EMPOWER IN AND HUMBLE WE HAD ONLY ONE DEVELOPER APPLY FOR NO PLACE IKE HOME. WHILE WE WERE TO BUILD THE HOUSING STOCK STATE INVESTMENT AND BOARDING CARE HOMES WOULD HELP SHORE UP EXISTING HOUSE THE HOUSING OPTIONS FOR OUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS OR MORE EXPENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL CARE. WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT ONCE UNITS ARE BUILT LONG TERM RENTAL SUBSIDIES ARE SIGNIFICANT GAPS. FOR THOSE NOT YET RECEIVING A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER COUNTIES MUST FIND THE GAP BETWEEN THE RENT AND TENANT CONRIBUTION. IN HUMBLE FOR USING A COMBINATION OF ONE TIME FUNDS SUCH AS HE AND LOCAL STATE SALES TAX REVENUE A LONG TERM STATE FUNDED RENTAL SUBSIDY PROGRAM COULD HELP FILL THE SECTION EIGHT GAP IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY. LASTLY RURAL COUNTIES HAVE LONG USED REGIONAL APPROACHES TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. INCENTIVES TO COLLABORATE REGIONALLY WHERE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WILL PRODUCE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR SMALL AND RURAL COUNTIES THAN A SIGNING REGIONAL BOUNDARIES BASED ON GEOGRAPHY. MOST RURAL COUNTIES WILL ACT REGIONALLY BUT WE NEED THE FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHICH JURISDICTIONS AND HOW BEST TO COLLABORATE. HUMBOLDT COUNTY HAS WORKED ON HE PROJECTS WITH TWO OF OUR CITIES AND WE ARE NOW EMBARKING ON THE CHALLENGE OF CONVENING ALL OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SETTING COUNTY WIDE GOALS AND EXPLORING DATA AND MEASUREMENTS TO ENSURE COUNTY WIDE SUCCESS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT OUR ROLE HOUSING CHALLENGES WE LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING WITH OUR STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES. OF THE WORLD FULL OF ARE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE GOOD MORNING- MY NAME'S JERRY REMEMBERS FROM THE LA COUNTY HOMES INITIATIVE- THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE SERVICE SOME- WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN OUR THERE ARE NO LA COUNTY- BRIEFLY GO OVER SOME BACKGROUND ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND ALSO SOME RESULTS BUT I ALSO WANT TO FOCUS ON A REGIONAL EFFORTS IN HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE THINK IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES. SO AS THE OTHER COUNTY- OF. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SISTER TO COME INTO CONTACT WITH HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. FOR MANY MANY YEARS. BUT IT WAS NEVER DONE IN A COORDINATED FASHION. SO YOU KNOW THE COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE THE LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FELT THEY HAD THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO DO IT. SO TO THE FIFTEEN DAY INITIATED THE HOMELESS INITIATIVE IS WHAT WE CALL OUR EFFORTS. AND STILL THIS EFFORT THE GOAL WAS TO. A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF STRATEGIES TO PREVENT COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. SO THE COUNTY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE- EMBARKED ON AN INCLUSIVE AND COLLABORATIVE SIX MONTH PROCESS TO DEVELOP THESE STRATEGIES WHICH WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF TWENTY FIVE COUNTY DEPARTMENTS. OVER THIRTY CITIES HUNDRED THE COMMUNITY-% SERVICE PROVIDERS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THAT INCLUDED EIGHTEEN THREE OUR POLICY SUMMIT THAT WE DID- FOR FOCUS GROUPS WITH PEOPLE LIVED EXPERIENCE- TOO LARGE COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND WE RECEIVED OVER TWO HUNDRED PUBLIC COMMENTS- BASED ON THIS WHOLE PROCESS WE DEVELOPED OF FORTY SEVEN STRATEGIES- COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES- THAT WAS A APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND- FEBRUARY. SEVENTEENTH IN ADDITION TO APPROVING THOSE ARE STRATEGIES THE ALL ON THAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND MY- UP TO START. WE WILL OFF OF MONEY TO GET A YOU KNOW OF A OUR PROBLEM BUT IT WAS A START IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FROM YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE RESIDENTS OF LA COUNTY APPROVED MEASURE RATES WHICH IS A QUARTER CENT SALES TAX- THAT WOULD GENERATE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARSA YEAR- TO. INPUT PRODUCTS THIS WOULD BE FOR TEN YEARS AND THESE FUNDS WOULD BE- EXCLUSIVELY FOR- TO BE SPENT ON HOMELESSNESS. SPECIFIC TO THE IMPACT OF MEASURE RATES FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS SINCE JULY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- OUT AS MENTIONED EARLIER WORK. ON CLOSE TO TWENTY THOUSAND FAMILY MEMBERS AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY HOUSE BECAUSE OF MEASURE RATES. AND ANOTHER FORTY THOUSAND PHONE NUMBERS INDIVIDUALS WERE HAVE ENTERED AN- ENTRY INTO THE HOUSING- BECAUSE OR- KIND OF OUR- OUR EFFORTS IN WORKING WITH THE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES THAT WE HAVE IN LA COUNTY WITH DALY CITY BEING ONE. THE BIGGEST ONE IN A REALLY CLOSE PARTNER- BUT THERE'S ALSO. EIGHTY SEVEN OTHER CITIES IN THE COUNTY. AND SO THIS IS A REGIONAL PROBLEM AND WE UP WE START ALL ALWAYS- THINKING THAT IT'S THERE NEEDS TO BE A REGIONAL SOLUTION. SO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OF THE COUNTY PROVIDED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO CITIES TO DEVELOP HOMELESS PLANS. AND SO OUR OFFICE THE PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AND TO SYSTEM TO DO THAT FOR YOU WHEN CITIES IN OUR- IN OUR COUNTY- DEVELOP THESE PLANS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MILLION DOLLAR MEASURE RATE FUNDS. FOR THE CITY'S IMPLEMENTOR PLAN. THIRTY ONE CITIES ACTUALLY- TOOK US ON UP ON THAT DEAL IN SOME OF THESE TO THESE INCLUDED LAND USE AND HOUSING ORDINANCES- PROPERTY ACQUISITION FOR INTERMENT PERMANENT HOUSING- SOCIAL ENTERPRISE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS AS WELL AS YOU KNOW- GETTING HEALTHY NAVIGATORS MOTEL VOUCHERS. SO SOLD EXAMPLES OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW. IN ADDITION TO FUNDING THE CITIES WE ALSO FUNDED THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS WHICH IS YOU KNOW- ASSOCIATION REGIONAL CITY GOVERNMENT TO GET TOGETHER EVERY SO OFTEN AND DISCUSS ISSUES. SO WE PROVIDED SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN MEASURE IT'S FUNDS TUBES THE SEVEN COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS IN LA COUNTY- IN MAINLY WE'D LIKE THEM TO TAKE MORE OF A REGIONAL APPROACH AND WORKING WITH CITIES. CHRIS LIFE SUPPORT HOUSING AND HEALTHY AND ALSO WITH ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HOMELESS DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE AND I THINK IT'S- YOU MENTIONED AGAIN IS YOU KNOW THE FAIRS AND CHALLENGES OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IS THAT IT'S BASICALLY ECONOMIC DISPARITIES- AND COMBINE FORCES. OF SKY ROCKY RANTS ON JUST DEPICTIONS- AND SEVERE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN LA COUNTY SEVEN WITH A TO IT HAVE RESULTED IN SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND SEVERELY RED BIRD AND- TENANTS IN LA COUNTY WHICH IS DRIVING MORE PEOPLE INTO HOMELESSNESS- IT'S IMPORTANT NOT THAT I'M NOT ALL THE- ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE REMAINED ON THE STREET ALL YEAR. WE SEE A DYNAMIC INFLOW AND OUTFLOW THE HOME OF DELIVERY SYSTEM HAS HELPED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EXIT HOMELESSNESS BUT THE ECONOMIC PRESSURES PUTS THOUSANDS MORE TO HOMELESSNESS- ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HOUSE MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER IN THE LAST FEW YARS OUR AFFORDABILITY. IS OVER NOW I IS IN HOMELESSNESS ARE YOU PROBABLY HEARD THAT BEFORE I KNOW. TIMES NOW LIKE HAPPY. THE STATE ON DAY INTO THE EIGHTEEN. A HUNDRED THIRTY HUNDRED THIRTY THREE P. ESCAPE HOMELESSNESS IN LA COUNTY BUT A HUNDRED FIFTY. PEOPLE PER DAY BECAME HOMELESS. SO WE ARE COLLECTIVELY WORKING HARDER FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN EVER BEFORE TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS BUT THE RATE OF INFLOW THE HOMES IS THREATENING TO OVERWHELM US. SO WHAT WE NEED AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING- WE NEED FINANCING INCENTIVES TO CREATE AND PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN ALL OUR EIGHT EIGHT CITIES AND UNINCORPORATED AREAS IN LA COUNTY. WE NEED RENTAL AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE AT RISK OF HOUSING STABILITY THIS INCLUDES TEN IN EDUCATION AND OUT REACH LEGAL REPRESENTATION- WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO HELP TENANTS BETWEEN HOUSING STABILITY ALL THOSE THINGS. SO I KNOW ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES- CLOSING NOW LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR PARTNERS IN THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK- IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT INCLUDES MOST OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES. IN LA COUNTY- THE VETO OF THE CONVENIENCE OF CARE IN LA COUNTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FAITH LEADERS BUSINESS LEADERS PHILANTHROPY- THOSE WOULD LIVED EXPERIENCE WHO WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH.AND OF COURSE THE STATE SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND IN IN TRYING TO SOLVE. THIS THIS HUMAN CRISIS THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. ADAM WE'RE GOING ON ORDER YOU KNOW WHATEVER OR DO PREFER NOT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE ORDER I CALLED IN AND SO. AND ANYONE AND EVERYONE. GOOD MORNING I'M JOE TO CATCH A SIDE DISABILITY YOU COULD SEE IT ON THE AGENDA- SO I WANTED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND WHERE THEY GOT STARTED BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WE TALK ABOUT CONTINUUM OF CARE AND THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION IS MISSING SO- THE FROM THE CONTINUUM OF CARE WERE MANDATED TO BE ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. THE POINT IN TIME HE FOUND WAS MANDATED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE FROM NINETEEN NINE THERE WERE MINIMAL MEN MINIMAL REGULATIONS AROUND CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND HOW THEY OPERATED- IT WAS BASICALLY A PUT OUT THERE THAT EACH COMMUNITY NEEDED TO ESTABLISH A CONTINUUM OF CARE IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE RECEIVING HAD FUNDING. AND THEIR WORK COMMUNITIES THAT CAME TOGETHER SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A LOT OF CONTINUUM'S THAT ARE FRESNO MADERA OR KINGS TULARE MEANS AND THEY'VE JOINED JOIN TOGETHER AND TO DO THE ACTIVE. SEVENTY LIKE TO PLAY. IN TWO. NINE THE HARD FACT WAS SIGNED AND IT KIND OF CHANGE EVERYTHING. EIGHT THAT THERE IS A LOCAL COMPETITION THAT TAKES PLACE WHEN THE HUD COMPETITION OPENS EVERY YEAR- THAT REQUIRES THAT THAT LOCAL COMPETITION RESULT IN WHAT'S CALLED A PRIORITY LISTING AND WHICH IS THE RATING AND RANKING OF EACH APPLICATION. AND THAT THAT'S VOTED ONBY THE LARGER CONTINUING GROUP BY THE MEMBERSHIP ON THE BOARD OF ACTORS DEPENDING ON HOW EACH CONTINUE I'M IS STRUCTURED. IT ALSO MANDATED THAT WE IMPLEMENT COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEMS- WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AN A AND A FACT A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY OF PRIORITIZING FOLKS FOR HOUSING AND ASSESSING WHICH HOUSING INTERVENTION IS GONNA BE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR PEOPLE. AND THEN IT ALSO GAVE GUIDANCE ON THE MAKE UP OF CONTINUUM OF CARE BOARDS SO WHAT TYPES OF PEOPLE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING. AND IN A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE HOSPITALS AT THE TABLE YOU SHOULD HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE TABLE. SO THERE WAS A LIST OF FOLKS THAT CONTINUE ARMS NEEDED TO AIMS AT BRING BRING TO THE TABLE FOR THOSE DISCUSSIONS. IT ALSO WILL GO THE HOMELESS DEFINITION A LITTLE BIT SO OUR CURRENT DEFINITIONS WE HAVE CAN'T WAIT FOUR CATEGORY IS. THE CATEGORY ONE WHICH IS A PLACE NOT MEANT FOR HUMAN HABITATION LIVING AT. THE SHELTER- HOMELESS PRIOR TO ENTERING AN INSTITUTION AND STAYING NINETY DAYS OR LESS AND RETURNING. TO HOMELESSNESS SO. THAT FIRST I MEAN THAT THAT YOU NEED A INSTITUTION REQUIREMENT. LIMIT SIGNS FROM WHO WE CAN SERVE THAT IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO SOMEONE EXITING PRESIDENT. IS ALREADY YOUR THEY'VE BEEN THERE LONGER THAN NINETY DAYS. PRETTY MUCH A 100% OF THE TIME AND- THEY WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES THAT ARE HARD FUNDED. CATEGORY TWO IS AN EMINENT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS FOURTEEN DAYS TO THEIR AFFECTION. CATEGORY THREE IS HOMELESS BATES ARE A AS DEFINED BY OTHER STATUTES. EACH CONTINUE ON WOULD HAVE TO APPLY TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT DEFINITION ABOUT DEFINITION WOULD INCLUDE YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- HOMELESS COUNT SWITCHES FAMILIES THAT ARE RESIDING AND MOTELS THAT ARE DOUBLE DOT. COUCH SURFING THOSE SITUATIONS THE PROBLEM THE REASON THAT ALL AND FOR. OUR UTILIZING LACKEY ARE YOU TO BE ABLE TO SERVE FOLKS WITH HAD FUNDS IS BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR A MUCH BROADER POPULATION SO AS MUCH AS WE'RE SEEING OUR NUMBERS GROW AND TRYING TO STRUCTURE FUNDS. AS FAR AS WE CAN ADDING IN THAT MISSION ALL MUCH LARGER GROUP OF PEOPLE BUT STRETCH THE FUNDS EVEN FURTHER. I THEN CATEGORY FOR FLEEING TO MASS BY. IT ALSO CHANGED ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS DEFINITION A LITTLE BIT. CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS USED TO BE A CONSECUTIVE YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO CHAU CONSECUTIVE ONE YEAR ON THE STREETS AND A DISABLING CONDITION- IT IS NOW AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. ON THE STREETS FOR A CONSECUTIVE YEAR OR BE ABLE TO SHOW THREE FOUR EPISODES OF HOMELESSNESS AND THREE YEARS THAT ADD UP TO TWELVE MONTHS. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE DOCUMENTATION NIGHTMARE. SO THAT'S JUST KIND OF A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT YOU KNOW WORK CONTINUUM'S CAME FROM WHAT WERE CHARGED WITH DOING AND- MOST CONTINUUM'S DO SERVE ALSO AS AS LIKE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BODY FOR THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE DOING THE WORK SUMMER MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT INCORPORATED NONPROFIT. THAT DESIGNATED ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITY AND TO ADMINISTER THEIR FUNDS THAT ARE. ARE ALLOCATED TO CEO SEES SO THAT THE STRUCTURE IS REALLY DIFFERENT ACROSS THE STREET FOR THE CROSS THE STATE FOR EACH CONTINUE ON- AS FAR AS WHAT'S HAPPENING AND FRESNO. SO WITH THE NEW FUNDS THE HEAP AND THAT CASH FUNDS THAT CAME OUT. FRESNO HAD WE HAD NO SHELTERS BASICALLY WE HAD ONE RESCUE MISSION SHELTER SO- WE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH FOR TRIAGE SHELTERS WHICH ARE EMERGENCY SHELTERS THAT ARE HYPER FOCUSED ON HELPING FOLKS AND THEIR HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THE NINETY DAYS THAT WOULD. WE ARE THAT WE DETERMINED WAS THE MAX DAY FOR OUR TRIAGE SHELTERS. SO IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN BEDS WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IN FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY SO FAR WE'VE SERVED OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THOSE SHELTERS SINCE JULY FIRST 66% OF FOLKS THE ENTERED THOSE SHELTERS WENT INTO- LEFT TO A SAFE EXIT WHICH CAN INCLUDE BRIDGE HOUSING OR- PERMANENT HOUSING. WE ESTABLISHED FORTY FIVE NEW BED OF BRIDGE HOUSING WHICH IS A SIX MONTH MAX STAY WITH SIR SIXTY FOUR PEOPLE IN THOSE BANDS. AND 86% OF THOSE WERE SAFE ACCENTS. WE ESTABLISHED FORTY FIVE NEW RAPID RE HOUSING BEDS THAT ARE JUST NOW COMING ONLINE CENTER HAVE DATA FOR THOSE. AND THEN WE IMPLEMENTED A DIVERSION PROGRAM AND NOT STARTED IN OCTOBER AND WE HAVE SERVE SEVENTY SIX SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE WITH 91% OF THEM ACCIDENT DEPARTMENT HOUSING. WHICH IS. REALLY JUST A TESTAMENT TO. SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T NEED A LOT IN ORDER TO NOT FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS PERMANENTLY. SO IN TOTAL WE HAVE WITH THE NEW FUNDS WE'VE ALREADY SERVE SINCE JULY FIRST FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE AND VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS AND THIS WAS HUGE FOR OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE HAVE A REAL POLITICAL PUSH ON- WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SAY. PUBLICLY THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT HELP AND THAT- PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS DON'T WANT SHELTER- ALL OF OUR SHELTERS WERE FULL WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF OPENING SO I'M HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN BEDS FILLED LIKE IMMEDIATELY WHICH IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE NARRATIVE ABOUT PEOPLE REALLY NEEDING AND WANTING HELP. SELL I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME HERE AND- THANK YOU. YOU. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE CHAIRS COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER ON SENATOR JACKSON'S- MY POWERS THE- CEO FOR THE COUNTY OF INTERNET ALSO JOINED BY THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD SUPERVISOR LONG AND THANK YOU FOR ENGAGING WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO COMMITTEE PROVIDERS UP. BERMAN FOCUS HERE WE'LL HAVE OUR CHALLENGES I'M GONNA FOCUS A LITTLE BIT TODAY- WHAT'S WORKING A TO GIVE YOUR PROFILE OF INTERCONTINENTAL LITTLE BIT OF PHILLIP. URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL SO GOOD PROFILE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION. AND TEN CITIES SO. YOU KNOW SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW FORMING OUR CONTINUE WITH CARE. WE NEED TO DO IT FOR HER OF COURSE BUT WE WANTED TO BE MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE WE KNEW WE HAD A LOT OF GOOD GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY BUT NOT ENOUGH MONEY AND WE WANT TO TARGET THE FUNDS. PRACTICES THAT WE KNEW WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE SO FORMED AND COMPOSITIONS IMPORTANT ACCOUNT ON THERE FOR THE TEN CITIES AREA HOUSING AUTHORITIES- COMMITTEE BASED POSITIONS IN A WOMAN WITH A- LOOKS. AND UP IT. KING EXTREMELY WELL JUST YOU A SENSE. WHEN OTHER HEAT MONEY CAME OUT WE HEADED UP THAT CRISIS RESOLUTION WE ALL DID IT JUST LIKE THAT- THERE WAS ABOUT FOUR HAVE MILLION ON THE TABLE EIGHTEEN MILLION REQUESTS. BUT IT ALL WENT SURPRISINGLY SMOOTHLY AS I TELL THE GROUP WERE EMBARRASSINGLY FUNCTIONAL. ENOUGH BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T SEE A BIG FOOD FIGHT OVER IT- NOBODY CAME TO THE COUNTY NOBODY CAME TO THE CITY COUNCILS- THE- COMMUNITY GROUPS GOT ON BOARD AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD. AND IT'S REALLY WORKING AND SO. WITH THAT HE FUNDING THE OUR COUNTY BOARD ALSO IN LEADERSHIP STEPPED UP AND SAYS WE WILL MATCH THE START UP COSTS. AND THE ONGOING COSTS OF ANY PERMANENT YEAR ROUND SHELTER IN THE COUNTY. BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE. AND WE HAD TO CITIES TAKE US. THAT THE CITY OF INTERIM FACTION WEEK- TO GET OLD- COUNTY BUILDING ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING AND WE- LET. AND ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO WE OPENED IN OUR FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR HISTORY OF OUR COUNTY WE OPENED OUR FIRST PERMANENT. RUN FILTER- AND IT'S UP AND GOING IS WORKING VERY WELL WE HAD IN OUR OF P. OUT THERE. IMMERSE HOUSING EXPERIENCE PROVIDER. AND FIFTY FIVE BEDS. AND TO LOW BARRIER AND SO THAT'S- IT'S WORKING. VERY WELL IT'S CITY BLOCKS ARE ALSO HAS A YEAR ROUND SHELTER IT'S TEMPORARY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A- PERMANENT. HOME BUT- KEEP MONEY IS ALSO BEING USED FOR THAT AS WELL AND IT HELPS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK. AT THAT FIRST CHALLENGES AGO HOW WE GONNA DO THIS BY OURSELVES BUT IF THE STATE. PUTS MONEY IN THE COUNTY PUT MONEY IN THE CITY IN THE COMMUNITY. NEXT THING YOU KNOW THAT INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY ACHIEVABLE. AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. THERE ARE WHETHER YOU'RE RUN SHELTER. THE KEEP FUNDS OR HAVE ALSO BEEN USED FOR H. P. R. P. THE HOMES VENTURE EVER HOUSING. INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE EFFECTIVE. YOU KNOW 80% OF THESE FOLKS TO HOUSE TO A ONE YEAR LATER. WE THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE BANDAID BUT IT'S WAY MORE THAN THAT AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OUR- FROM OUR COLLEAGUES HERE- WE'VE USED TO. THE H. P. RPM ISSUE THE HE FUNDS- YOU KNOW. ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TEN EMERGENCY SHELTERS SEVENTY FOUR PERMANENTLY HOUSE- FIFTY PREVENTED HOMELESSNESS AND FORTY FIVE RE HOUSE. AND SO- THE PARTNERS ARE REALLY WORKING EXTREMELY WELL TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT. WE THINK A PERMANENT ONGOING FUNDING IT IS GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IT TOOK DECADES TO GET TO THIS POINT. IS NOT GONNA BE SOLVED IN ONE MINUTE ONE YEAR INCREMENTS. AND THE THING WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IS ARE WORKING. AND JUST CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT THE OUTCOME MEASURES. THERE'S MEANINGFUL GOOD MEASURES OUT THERE WE'RE MEASURING TO THEM WE USE THEM TO EVALUATE PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A PROGRAM THAT'S NOT LOW BARRIER. YOU KNOW WE'VE JUST CONTINUE FUNDING THAT FORTUNE. FOR US MOST OF OUR PROVIDERS A GUN ABOARD SAYS WE WANT TO BE LOW BARRIER. BUT WERE USING THOSE MEASURES AND WE WANT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. TO WE URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO. DRAW UP A NETWORK AND ABOUT THE REGIONAL. PEACE WITH RESPECT WE APPRECIATE. THIS BUT GOVERNOR PASSION. TO BE PULLED IN BIG CHANGES WE GET THAT. BUT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT ADDS A LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY THAT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP OUR OUR PROCESS OUR PROCESS IN VENTURA COUNTY. AT LEAST IS WORKING VERY WELL IN TERMS OF LOCAL PLANNING AND PARTNERING WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THAT. WE ALSO HAVE. A PERSON QUE. PROGRAMMER ONE OF TWENTY FIVE. THAT IMPLEMENTED THAT IS WORKING TO GREAT EFFECT WE HAVE ABOUT. ELEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE SIGNED UP IN IT. I THOUGHT. I WOULD I KNEW IT A HIGH UTILIZED OR WAS IT USED TO WORK IN HEALTHCARE. THESE ARE FOLKS WHO USE THE E. R. SOME OF THEM. EVERY OTHER DAY OR SOMETIMES. EVERY DAY. OF A BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM CASE MANAGEMENT WE HAVE A- A REALLY OF BROAD COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE HAVE THE CASE MANAGEMENT PRIMARY CARE. WE HAVE A- COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER. AND THAT'S- BUT SOFT AS HELPING US. PEOPLE TO THE SERVICE MAKE SURE. GET THE MEDICATIONS THEY- COME THEY GET TO THE DOCTOR TO GET THE TEST. ALL THAT. WE SEE. YOUR IT'S- TO. WITH THE- RAM AND SAVE. MILLIONS AROUND. SEE WE ARE SERVICE PROGRAM WE ALSO STE OF BOB YES WE TAKE OUR EGGS STAFF AND IN ONE SAME TIME EVERY SAME OKAY OF THAT WOULD REALLY STAFFORD JUST IN ONE CORE TO LOCATE TO CONNECT TO SERVE COMMUNITY BASED ON GOVERNMENT PROVIDERS AND SO FORTH IT'S REALLY WORKING AND NOW WE HAVE SEVEN SITES AND THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAM DOVETAILS WITH THAT AGAIN NICE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SHOWER POTS AND SO FORTH BUT WE'RE ALSO CONNECTING INTO HOMES PREVENTION RAPIDLY HOUSING AND VETERANS BENEFITS AND SO FORTH THERE SO- AGAIN- WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN OUR- IN OU- WHAT'S HAPPENING LOCALLY IN AND- WE REALLY THINK THAT THAT THE MODEL THAT WE HAVE A FUNDING- THE CFCS. IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL ONE I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND SENATORS MY NAME IS MATTHEW CHESTER I'M THE DEPUTY CITY MANAGER IN THE CITY OF HALF MOON BY- CITY POPPING BAY IS A SMALL COASTAL COMMUNITY AND CEMETERY COUNTY SENATOR COUNTY IS. AN AFFLUENT COMMUNITY NESTLED BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND SILICON VALLEY. AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF COLLABORATION BUT ALSO- THE WEALTH DISPARITY IS VERY VERY EVIDENT IN CEMETERY COUNTY- TO START- I REALLY HAVE TO START WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. MUCH LIKE THE GENTLEMAN FROM LOS ANGELES MENTIONED- THE COUNTY RECOGNIZED ITS RESOURCES AND ABILITY TO LEAD IN THIS AREA. AND SO THEY'VE REALLY TAKEN THE MANTLE OF LEADERSHIP IN COORDINATING WITH- TWENTY CITIES WITHIN CEMETERY COUNTY- TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL IN A ORDINATED EFFORT WORKING TOGETHER. SHARING BEST PRACTICES IN COMMUNICATE THE TOP OF THE- AS WE WORK WITH THIS POPULATION- THEY DON'T GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE- THEY DON'T GET LOST AS- FOR FROM CITY. THROUGH PROGRAMS. YOU'RE THE STOCKS INTO PERMANENT. SOME OF THINGS COUNTIES DOING THEY READ THE HOPE IN OUR AGENCY CAL WHICH IS LED BY COUNTY SUPERVISOR STAFF BY HUMAN SERVICES STAFF. AND IT'S A COMBINATION OF CITIES COUNTY STAFF AND- NONPROFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND WE MEET QUARTERLY AND TALK ABOUT ISSUES RECEIVE DATE AND PRESENTATIONS AND IT'S REALLY EFFECTIVE WAY TO NETWORK. AND TALK ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY ALSO PROVIDES- CASE MANAGEMENT FOR HOMELESS OUT REACH TEAMS WHICH ARE BASED GENERALLY. AND THIS IS A- KEY IN MAKING SURE THAT AS WE TRACK THESE INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THE SYSTEM THAT AGAIN THEY DON'T GET LOST WE KNOW THAT AS INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THEIR NEEDS ARE PROVIDED FOR AS THEY NAVIGATE THE DETAILS ON THAT RAN. TO ACTUALLY RECEIVE HOUSING. WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE SEVERAL REGION SHELTERS UNDER FUNDED BY THE COUNTY THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO OUR RESIDENTS AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL ALL THE THINGS THAT THE STERLING. OPTIONS WERE GREAT THERE WE. TALK HAPPEN WE ARE CAN OF APPROXIMATELY THREE TO. AS SENATOR COUNTIES A VERY URBAN- COUNTY- EXCEPT FOR HALF MOON BAY AND THE CO SIDE- WERE QUITE WILLING- ISOLATED FROM THE REST THE COUNTY- TO THE NORTH OF US IS APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN THOUSAND MORE UNINCORPORATED RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVE SERVICES MY COUNTY BUT- WORK AND I GO TO SCHOOL. AND SHOP INHALF MOON BAY AND SO AS A CITY WE LOOK AT THE REGION- WE CANNOT JUST FOCUS ON THE CITY ITSELF. SO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- ARE HOMELESS CRISIS REALLY CAME TO A HEAD- SMALLING KIM AND BEHIND A SHOPPING CENTER ALONG- A CITY ON CREEK- KIND OF WENT UNCHECKED. AND IT GREW TO OVER FORTY INDIVIDUALS WHICH FOR SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM I KNOW THAT'S A SMALL NUMBER BUT FOR CITY LIKE CAPTAIN MAY THAT IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS ISSUE- WERE COMPASSIONATE COMMUNITY BUT AS THE FIRE STARTED TO RACE. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE ENCAMPMENTS AS WELL AS THEIR OWN SAFETY- THE END OBVIOUSLY CRIME HEALTH AND SANITATION ISSUES. REALLY MET THE CITY AND COUNTY HAD TO STEP IN AND DO SOMETHING. OVER EIGHT MONTH PERIOD WE EMPLOYED- WE BELIEVE FOR ITS PRACTICES MANY OF WHICH ARE NOW. OF THE NEW POLL COMING OUT OF THE BOISE DECISION. AND WE MADE SURE THAT WE PROVIDED A LOT OF OUTREACH TO THE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THESE ENCAMPMENTS WE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH THEM IN OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO TRANSITION THEM OUT OF AN ENCAMPMENT AS OPPOSED TO PUSHING THEM OUT- I THINK THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING WE DID IS WHAT WE CALLED INTENSIVE SERVICE STAYS WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT- ON THREE OCCASIONS DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS PERIOD. WE BROUGHT THE SERVICES RIGHT INTO THE IN CAMERA WE SET UP TENTS WE BROUGHT IN FOOD. ALL THE SERVICES PROVIDE SERVICE PROVIDERS CAME FROM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AND MET THESE PEOPLE EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE. IN EACH OF THOSE WE FOUND TO BE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ACTUALLY TRANSITION IN MANY OF THESE INTO SHELTER ON THE SAME DAY- OTHERS INTO OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PRO. COMES AND AT THE TIME WE ACTUALLY CLOSE THE A CHEMICAL PLANT I'M AT THE ONLY IF PEOPLE. HUNTER LAUGHED AS WE SEE OUR CLEAN UP. SO TO SAY WE KNOW THE- POLICIES GONNA OUT OF THE BOYS YOU TO SEE CAN QUITE. TO INDIVIDUAL- JURISDICTIONS I CAN TESTIFY THAT- IT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO APPROACH THIS AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE PLENTY OF SHELTER SPACE OUR COUNTY EXPANDED SHELTER SPACE BE ADDED ANIMAL- IT PLACES FOR ANIMALS AND STORAGE OF PEOPLE'S GOODS. AND IT REALLY MADE THE TRANSITION EASIER FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED. ANOTHER AREA THAT'S BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IS WE HAVE A SMALL LOCAL NONPROFIT- THAT OPERATES IN HALF MOON BAY UP ON AGREES CO SITE WORKER THEY STARTED TO- BY OPERATING WHAT WE CALL FULL SERVICE FULL CIRCLE FOOD PROGRAM. THEY HAVE A DONATED PORTION OF A FARM THAT SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK THEY TAKE- ANYBODY THAT'S ALMOST OR NOT- BUT WILLING TO WORK UP TO THE FARM IN THE- THE TELL THE GROUND AT THE PLANT THE CROPS THE HARVEST THE CROPS. THEN THEY TAKE THOSE CROPS TO DISTRIBUTE THEM- TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WORKING AND ALSO ADD ON MULTIPLE BREAKFASTS ARE AVAILABLE TO. LISTEN LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND HALF MOON BAY. BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE PAID FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO SO THEY'RE STARTING TO RECEIVE- SUBSIDIZED WORK EXPERIENCE THAT- ULTIMATELY HELP SOME TO TRANSITION INTO- UNSUBSIDIZED WORK- TWO YEARS AGO THE CITY IMPLEMENTED A PILOT PROGRAM CALLED THE COAST CLEANUP TEAM- ROB BONTA GRACE IS. MINISTRY THAT PROGRAM BUT WE DID AND HE THEY WORK WITH- THE SIMILAR POPULATION TO GO OUT AND CLEAN OUR BEACHES AND CLEAN PARKS IN OUR STREETS. AND NOT ONLY DOES THIS ITEM OF OUR COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE THE WAY IT LOOKS AND FEELS FOR EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY AS PRIDE DIGNITY AND CHANGE OF PERCEPTION. THE PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS WORK AND ANOTHER SOURCE OF INCOME FOR THESE FOLKS AND A PLEASED TO SAY THAT MANY OF THESE FOLKS TRANSITION INTO PERMANENT POSITIONS WITHIN BUSINESSES AND HAVE BEEN ALONG THE. THERE ARE POLICE SUBSTATION AND A COUNTY HEALTH CLINIC AND IT'S GOING TO BE USED AS A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CENTER WHERE ABOUT A GRACE CAN EXPAND ITS PROGRAMS WILL BRING CASE MANAGEMENT INTO THEIR I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM THE DIRECTOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE I CAME UP. IN THE COUNTIES COMMITTING- MOBILE HEALTH SERVICES THERE ONE DAY A WEEK AS WELL SO THAT THESE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WILL RECEIVE HEALTH SERVICES ON SITE THIS IS A PLACE THEY CAN GO ANY TIME THAT THEY NEED TO.TO RECEIVE SERVICES AND IT'S BEEN REALLY REALLY GREAT TO WORK WITH THIS- GREAT NONPROFIT AND WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD WANT TO END BY TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE OF INDIVIDUALS- THE FIRST IS NAMED TEA. AND SHE WAS A RESIDENT OF THE COAST SIDE OF HALF MOON BAY FOR MANY DECADES GAINFULLY EMPLOYED. MARRIED AT HOME. AND IN HER FORTIES SHE FACED A FAMILY CRISIS- SLIPPED INTO SOME MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND ADDICTION ISSUES. AND END UP BECOMING BECOMING HOMELESS- LIVED ON OUR STREETS FOR OVER A DECADE- SHE RECEIVE VOUCHERS AND WAS HOUSE SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. FORTUNATELY THE ISSUES DEALING WITH ME VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR BRITISH COMFORTABLE INDOORS AND THAT'S A PHENOMENON WE'VE OBSERVED WITH MANY OF THE HOMELESS WE'VE WORKED WITH. IS THE TRANSITION FROM THE STREETS TO AND- CAN ACTUALLY BE. QUITE DRAMATIC IN REQUIRE A LOT OF EXTRA HELP. I THINK THAT. I SUPPORTIVE SERVICES REALLY IMPORTANT. CHEN WE ARE A WE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED. FORCE TO REALLY ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY TEASE NEEDS- I'M FOR. WE WEREN'T ABLE TO HELP HER IN AND HOUSING AND SHE- AWAY SOME. WAS WRONG WE I FOR A STATE. YOU CAN. PUT A RESOURCE INDIVIDUAL RESOURCE TO SOME. BUT ULTIMATELY THEY THEY TO MAKE THE CHOICE ON HOW THEY RECEIVE THOSE THOSE RESEARCH. IS AND SOMETIME. THE AND. THIS IS JAY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL LIVED ON THE STREETS OF HALF THE FIRST DECADES HE WAS A HOMELESS IMPALA. FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN MAY HIS WAY TO THE COAST. CALLED AT HOME WE ONE OF OUR CREE IN A PRETTY I SETTING CREEKSIDE CAMPSITE FOR MANY YEARS I GOT TO KNOW HIM REALLY WELL THROUGH OUR SITE VISITS AND- VERY VERY. NICE MAN AN ARTIST LOVE TO DO ARTWORK CAN SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY- WOULD CLAIM HE WAS QUITE HAPPY LIVING ON THE ALL YOU KNOW ON THE LAND AND BY THE CREEK. BUT AS THE ENCAMPMENTS GREW- HE FELT THE PRESSURES AND THE STRESSES THAT COME FROM AND CAN'T MINCE AND- GRATEFULLY HE RECEIVED. VOUCHER AND WAS HOUSED- THIS PAST YEAR IN LOW INCOME SENIOR HOUSING AND HALF MOON BAY WE HAVE A LARGE COMPLEX WITH A LONG WAITING LIST. BUT HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ARE PRIORITIZED- HE MOVED INTO HIS APARTMENT YOU CAN SEE THERE ON THE RIGHT AND BROUGHT ALL HIS ARTWORK AND REALLY EXCITED- ABOUT A MONTH AFTER HE WAS HOUSE THOUGH I FOUND. ON OUR MAIN STREET IN AS WE- DON'T. AND WHAT BOB AND I CHATTED. KEEP THE BUS BACK TO THE PART SO I STARTED PUSH HIM DOWN THE STREET INTO TO ABOUT HOW THINGS WERE HE BURST INTO TEARS. HE WAS- EXPERIENCING PSYCHOSIS AGAIN THE TRANSITION FROM THE STREETS THE HOUSING WAS ACTUALLY QUITE TRAUMATIC FOR HIM AND- HE WANTED TO MOVE BACK OUT OF THIS HOUSING AND ON TO THE STREET GRATEFULLY- INTERVENTION HAPPENED- HE GOT THE SERVICES HE NEEDS. AND TO I SEE HIM EVERY DAY HANGING OUT IN THE PLAZA ACROSS FROM CITY HALL AND HE'S HAPPY. BEING IN THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK HE'S OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES AND HE IS NOW PERMANENTLY HOUSED I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THIS HEARING TODAY AND ASKED HIM YESTERDAY IF YOU COULD GO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY. TO THE SENATOR STAR LEADERS IN THE STATE. THE LIKE HIM. THEY WANT THREE THINGS THEY WANT A PLACE THAT THEY CAN CALL HOME AND FEEL DIGNIFIED ABOUT. THEY WANTED TO BE SAFE BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'D NEVER FEEL ONE ON THE STREETS SAFE. THIRD IS THEY WANT TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING MEMBER OF SOCIETY. AND SO- I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU FOR THE HELP THE SESSION TODAY AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE WORK THAT'S THAT'S HAPPENING HERE. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM EVERYTHING WE'VE HEARD TODAY TO HELP INDIVIDUALS LIKE T. M. J. MOVING TO A BETTER PLACE IN OUR LIVES. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH US IS REALLY- HELPFUL AND I KNOW- YOU KNOW AS WE HAVE THIS STATEWIDE CHALLENGE RUN HOME SINCE OF COURSE OF FALLS ON. LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES AND ONE THING I HAVE- OBSERVE ESPECIALLY THE LAST FEW YEARS IS- ALTHOUGH WE SAW ALWAYS HAVE. YOU KNOW LEVELS RESISTANCE TO PUTTING SHOT IS AN APPLICATION CENTERS ARE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING INTO COMMUNITIES- IN MY PERCEPTION IS THAT CITIES AROUND THE STATE. ARE BECOMING MUCH MUCH MORE EMBRACING. OF THESE SOLUTIONS- OR TRIAGE OR OR WHATEVER THE WHATEVER THE- AND MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER SEC. I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BE FRUSTRATED. ABOUT THE CONDITIONS ARE STREETS ARE ABOUT. ATTENDING CABINET. FIVE WE- HAVE TO BE SOLUTIONS. AND THE CANCERS WERE WHY THAT HAVE. BOISE WHAT ONE. ABOUT THAT. DECISION I THINK WHAT IT WHAT IT. I WAS HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH IS MAKING CLEAR TO CITIES- DIE- YOU CAN'T JUST SAY GO AWAY- YOU HOP TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES- UP FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE IT AREN'T JUST GOING TO GO AWAY PEOPLE ARE IN A COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE GOING TO. TO STAY THERE- SO I WANTED TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE CITIES ARE DOING WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT FINANCIALLY- AND OUR BUDGET I KNOW WE NEED TO DO EVEN MORE- TO HELP US CITIES- BUT WE ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS IN THE THIS GOVERNOR IS- HAS BEEN. MUCH MORE RECEPTIVE IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH US TO PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES. WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE CITIES LIFE EASIER LAST YEAR- WE WERE ABLE TO PASS- I INTRODUCED A BILL AND THEN A CUTTING CORPORATION TO THE BUDGET. TO STREAMLINE THE APPROVAL NOT SINCE EARLY THAT CITY ONCE BUT NOT IN CENTER AND- GOOD. IF IT MEETS AND IT'S IN A MIXED USE OR COMMERCIAL AREA IT'S APPROVED- THIS YEAR WE ASK A FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION CAUGHT HIM MAKE IT EVEN MORE STREAMLINED TO GET THE SERVICES IN PLACE WE'VE EFFECTIVELY STREAMLINED PART OF HOUSING ALL THROUGH CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE SENATE THE BILL THIRTY FIVE OTHER AYE ALTON TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND ADDITIONS LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU AUTHORED SPECIFIC TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING- AND- WE- SO THERE'S NO SEQUIN A CONDITIONAL USE FOR SUPPORT. IN CALIFORNIA ANY WORKS FINE TO REMOVE SOME OF THE STATE BARRIERS SO CITIES. AND TO PROVIDE MORE RESEARCH SAYS AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR REALLY- STEPPING UP ITS BEEN INSPIRING ACTUALLY TO SEE COMMUNITY STEP. THANK YOU CENTER FOR THAT SUPPORT INCREDIBLY HELPFUL WANT TO SHARE ONE INNOVATIVE THING WE'VE DONE IN OUR COUNTIES CITIES ARE STEPPING UP AS YOU SAY THEY SOUGHT CHALLENGES CITING THOSE LOCATIONS BUT BUT THIRD THEY SEE THE NEED MORE THAN THE COMMUNITY SEASONING. THAT NEED MORE BUT WE ALSO DEVELOPED A HOMELESS IMHO YOU WITH ALL ALL THE CITIES WERE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED WELL THEY DON'T NEED A SPECIAL FROM THEIR CITY BUT IF THE IF THE SOMEONE BILLS AT THE ONES BUILDING A SAND. GONNA GET HOMELESS FROM THE OTHER CITIES ARE RIGHT TO SAY LET'S. START IN A REASONABLE. SO WHAT WE ASK THAT ALL THE CITY'S. ON TO THE IMHO YOU SAYING THAT. WOULD PUT. HOMELESS SERVICES WHATEVER LEVEL THEY NEEDED FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION. IN THEIR CITIES. AND EVERYBODY WAS SORT OF. OUR OWN EMERGENCY HOUSING AND SHELTERS AND SO FORTH SO. WE HAVE SEVEN OF THE TO THESE CITIES SIGNED ON SO FAR- AND I THINK IT IT JUST SHOWS THE WORLD LEANING IN TO GATHER AND THEY ALL AGREE. TO PARTICIPATE INCORPORATED ENTRY LEVEL SINGLE COORDINATED FREE FOR ANYONE IS HOMELESS AND ARE COUNTY. AND THEY ALL AGREE TO. UP IN OUR HOMELESS. MAN TO ENSURE THAT BY ITSELF. THAT'S GREAT AND I THINK YOU WERE THE ONE WHO MENTIONED THAT YOU NOW HAVE A YEAR ROUND. THIS SHELTER BECAUSE WE- WHEN WE SAW. THIS WORK. YEARS SO WITH SO THAT MANY COUNTIES. HAVE YEAR ROUND. SHELTERS OR- HAVE A SHELTER. OR IN. AN AIRPORT. AT THE- OUR- TO GO. ANY BETTER. GRAPHIC EQUITY IS IMPORTANT. BAKER SAYS ONE QUITE- I. I I'M SOMEWHAT. I FORGOT TO. JUST ALASKA HOMELESS ACT. OF TWENTY TWO. WERE TO GET A PASSAGE OF THE IN STEP ON AND ONE OF THE WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THAT LEGISLATION ONE- DATA POINT THAT WE CAME UPON WAS A STARTLING IS A TWO THIRDS OF COUNTIES IN THE SOUTH TWO YEARS AGO TWO THIRDS OF COUNTIES DID NOT HAVE YOU SPECIFIC. HOMELESS PROGRAMS OVER THE PRIME MORE STATE SUPPORT- OFF BY. USING COUNTIES- CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT JUST ABOUT THE U. SPECIFIC PROGRAMEVENT- OR HOW YOU APPROACH THIS. HOMELESS YOUTH. QUICKLY LA QUE DOES OF OUR STRATEGIES ARE FOURTY SO STRATEGIES DEALS WITH HOMELESS- YOUTH. SO WE INVEST I FORGOT THE NUMBER BUT I THINK IT'S CLOSE TO. FIFTEEN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BASIC. THIS IS. OUR YOUTH SO WITH DO HAVE A PRO. FOR THE OFFICE ALEJO'S AND THE LARGER COUNTIES I THINK TEND TO BE MORE BUT- AND I LA HAS SOME TERRIFIC I KNOW SOME REALLY AMAZING PROGRAMS ABOUT MASSEUSE. AND IN A SMALLER COMMUNITY. THE OTHER OKAY GET. THEY ARE SO IN COUNTY IN FOR A LONG TIME THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAD AND IT WAS REALLY LIKE FROM. FRESNO TO AS FAR SOUTH AS- LOS ANGELES THERE WASN'T ANY OTHER HOMELESS YOUTH SHELTER FOR RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN- THERE WERE A WE HAD LIKE THREE TRANSITIONAL LIVING CENTERS WE LOST WHEN I HAD. DID IT- PULL AWAY FROM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AND RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. THROUGH SOME FEDERAL FUNDS A TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH SHELTER WHICH IS- THE ONLY ONE DEFINITELY NORTH BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD FRESNO. AND IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BAD SWEAR THEY'RE SERVING IN THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE POPULATION- BUT THEN ALSO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BRIDGE-HOUSING SO THE NEW FUNDS OF HELPED WITH THAT BUT I THINK THAT. LIKE IT'S NOT IN OFF. YET I SURE I WAS IN FRESNO AND I'M SOMEONE WHO'S INVOLVED WITH THAT AT IN THE CHEST OPEN AT A COUPLE YEARS AGO I'M NOT MISTAKEN. AND HE SAID THAT IF THEY OPEN UP WITH TWENTY FIVE BAD LIKE THREE HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE SHOWED UP FOR THOSE TWENTY FIVE BEDS- SO I. DO HAVE A LOT OF. CAPITAL IT'S- EXPAND THOSE RISKS. BECAUSE IF A KID BECOMES HOMELESS AT AGE SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN- AND YOU CAN RAPIDLY RE HOUSE- YOU CAN AVOID CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS WHEN THEY'RE ON THE STREET FOR FIVE TEN YEARS. YOU KNOW IT'S MUCH HARDER I THOUGHT WAS ON THOSE IN THOSE SLIDES. MONDAY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGE IS THAT. SO WHEN. I DID IT'S PUSHED WHERE THEY WOULDN'T THEY WOULDN'T. DO THE LAST POINT OF VIEW DIDN'T DEDICATE YOUR- CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. ANY NEW PROJECTS THAT WERE AWARDED WERE ALL DEDICATED CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AS- WELL YOU AGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE NOT. NOT CHRONICALLY HOMELESS THANKFULLY THEY DON'T MEET THAT DEFINITION. JEFF OLDER UNIT ARE THERE IS A LOT OF SUPPORT OF HOW DE TO CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATIONS TO FIND HOUSING THAT YOU QUALIFY FOR THAT IS YOU KNOW SERVICE INTENSIVE ENOUGH FOR THEM LIKE A LOT OF THEM NEED NEED HIGH NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES INSTEAD OF LIKE A SCATTERED RAPID RE HOUSING SITE MODEL WHERE THEY'RE PLACED INTO AN APARTMENT AND THEY SEE A CASE MANAGER A COUPLE TIMES A MONTH. SO THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE WE NEED T DO MORE TO OFFER MORE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR THAT AGE GROUP TO OFFSET WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SO MANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEDICATED. TO PEOPLE. THAT THE ARTS THOROUGHBREDS THAT YOUTH DON'T MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR. VENTURA COUNTY WERE OUR OUR BOARDS MADE IT CLEAR THEY DON'T WANT ANY USE AND IN THE SHELTERS AND SO WE'VE REALLY WE'VE BEEN. AGGRESSIVE BUT UTILIZING HOMES PREVENTION RAPIDLY HOPPING FUNDS A REAL SUBSIDIES TO HELP WITH THAT AND WE ARE ALSO ADVOCATING. FOR TRANSIT ALLEGE YOUTH A SHELTER IN OUR COUNTIES PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY THANK YOU. CALLING SO THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. NO YOU HAVE COVERED IT BEAUTIFULLY DOC NUMBER QUESTIONS. OKAY I THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO THE TO THE FINAL PANEL ALL BE FACILITATING THIS ONE. TO MY FELLOW OF MY FELLOW COMMITTEE CHAIRS OR DOING OTHER IMPORTANT WORK. SO THIS IS A. A PANEL FIBER FROM PRACTITIONERS ABOUT PRACTITIONER PERSPECTIVES AND STRATEGIES WE HAVE FOR- PANELS CHRIS MARTIN WHOSE- LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE- ON HOMELESSNESS FOR HOUSING CALIFORNIA- SHARON REPORT WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF- CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY AT C. S. H. CRISTESCU WELL WHO'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WINDS OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY- FOR USE- SERVICES IN MY AREA IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. AT THE STOP AND SUBDUE SO AGAIN ANY ORDER START BUTTON PROCEED- AND AGAIN FIVE MINUTES AND YOU'RE WELCOME NOT TO TAKE THE FULL FIVE MINUTES BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING- YOUR FULL OP FIRST OF. GREAT AND I TO PASS I'M SURE I CAN I PLUG REAL HERE FOR IF I'M A GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND- THANK FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER MARTIN- WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA MY LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOCUSED ON HOMELESSNESS. HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS A NONPROFIT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WITH THE MISSION TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS HOMELESS. AND EVERYONE ARE THOSE OF INCOME AS A CITY STABLE AND AFFORDABLE. PLACE TO LIVE. THIS HEARING OF THREE COMMITTEE THIS SHOWS YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE TO ADDRESS VAST CROSS. NATURE OF BALANCE TO FACE CALIFORNIA. A CALIFORNIA IS FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT AND LIGHT AND I'D LIKE TO PAINT A PICTURE OF WHO THESE CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM ARE INDIVIDUAL ADULTS AND OF THOSE FORTY ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS WE KNOW SOLUTION FOR POST ACUTE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL IS THE INTER TO KNOWN AS SUPPORT HOUSING WHICH HAS NO ITS IT COMES WITH THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS NECESSARY TO ALLOW TENANTS TO MAINTAIN HOUSING STABILITY IF. MOST SINGLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS DO NOT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES SUFFER FROM A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO HOUSING STABILITY. MOST SINGLE ADULTS AND FAMILIES SIMPLY NEED AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE TO AND THEY'RE HOMELESSNESS. BUT YET IN CALIFORNIA. FINDING AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE OUT OF REACH AS WAGES DO NOT KEEP UP WITH RENTS. THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY FOUND THAT 53% OF THEIR NEWLY HOMELESS RESIDENTS CITED ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. NOT MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE AS THEIR LEADING FACTOR TO BECOMING HOMELESS. LAST YEAR ALONE. EVEN THOUGH FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND OF THESE. NEW RESIDENTS WE WERE ABLE TO ACCESS HOUSING FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FELL NEWLY HOMELESS THIS THIS IS A DIRECT DIRECT RESULT OF MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS IN LOS ANGELES PAYING MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR RENT ON THE- ON HOUSING OR% KNOWN AS SEVERELY RAP BURDEN. AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A DIRECT RESULT OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS. THE REPORT IN FRONT OF YOU FROM THE NATIONAL LOW INCOME HOUSING COALITION. STATES THE FAIR MARKET RENT FOR A TWO BEDROOM HOME IN CALIFORNIA IS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FOUR DOLLARS. AND THE HOURLY WAGE NECESSARY TO AFFORD THAT RAN IS THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS AND SIXTY NINE CENTS. THIS MEANS THAT A MINIMUM WAGE EARNER WOULD HAVE TO WORK A THREE FULL TIME JOBS A WEEK TO A FOR THAT RENT. TO MAKE ENDS MEET MINIMUM WAGE EARNERS ARE OFTEN FORCED TO ACCEPT SUB STANDARD OR OVERCROWDED HOUSING OR OUTRAGEOUS COMMUTES RESULTING IN A LARGER LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE AND CASCADING EFFECTS ON SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. THE SAME REPORT SHOWED AFFORDABLE TO A HOUSEHOLD WORKING FULL TIME MINIMUM WAGE JOB WOULD SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS PER MONTH. IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT FINDING AN APARTMENT FOR SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. I CAN SPEAK MY PERSONAL. LIVING IN AMADOR COUNTY EAST OF SACRAMENTO WHERE I LIVE AND I FOUND THAT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE. THE HOUSING CRISIS IS CERTAINLY HITTING THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT IT IS MOST ACUTE. FOR PEOPLE EARNING AT OR BELOW 30% OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME WHICH IS DEFINED AS EXTREMELY LOW INCOME FOR. THREE QUARTERS OF CALIFORNIANS HOUSEHOLDS ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. AND MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT THIS MEANS THEY HAVE LITTLE LEFT OVER FOR OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES LIKE FOOD MEDICINE IN CHILDCARE AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE POPULATION MOST AT RISK FOR FALL AND HOMELESSNESS. WE MUST FOCUS THOSE PARDON ANY IMPACT I THE NIGHT OF PEOPLE EXT OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS LIKE THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM AT AGE CITY AND THE FEDERAL AND STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS BOTH PRIORITIZE THESE HOUSEHOLDS WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THOSE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE WE ARE SERVING HOUSEHOLDS WITH THE GREATEST NEED YET HOUSING PROGRAMS. TO SERVE ILL I HOW OLD IS STILL NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE MOST PROGRAMS DO NOT SPECIFICALLY TARGET HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE AVERAGE INCOME FOR A PERSON EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IS 14% OF THE AREA MEDIAN WHICH IS WELL OF COURSE THE THIRTY TARGET ANY PROGRAMS YES SINCE HOUSEHOLDS EARNING BELOW 30% OF AM I OUR HONOR ON TO AFFORD THEIR PORTION OF SUBSIDIZED. LEAVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OWNERS TO ABSORB OPERATE CASA THOSE ARE UNIT UNABLE TO THE PARTYIN. IN OTHER THIS GAP MEAN TO ARE AT ELI HOUSE CANNOT PENCIL OUT SPECIFICALLY OF THAT RENTAL UNIT IS A HOUSING A FORMALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO HOUSE IN INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THROUGH A PRO LIKE AGE. MHP PROGRAM A DEVELOP BUYERS AN OPERATING SUBSIDIES SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO COVER THIS GAP AND MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS DO NOT PROVIDE THE SUBSIDY FOR ANOTHER WAY TO PROVIDE HOUSING TO THIS SPECIFIC POPULATION IS THE CLOSEST PULLED WITH LIFE SERVICE AND THE NAVIGATION. IS HE DOES NOT HAVE A STATEWIDE PROGRAM LIKE THE- AS MENTIONED EARLIER A GREAT MODEL FOR THIS IS A FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL IN LOS ANGELES WHICH COUPLES RENTAL ASSISTANCE WITH CASE MANAGEMENT HOUSING NAVIGATION AND TENDENCY SUPPORTS TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS IMMEDIATELY AND KEEP THEM HOUSE. WELL IT'S BEEN PROVEN SUCCESS WITH MORE THAN ITS SIX YEAR OF OPERATION. IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF TOOLS TO LOWER THE COST AND TIME TO BUILD HOUSING. INCLUDING WITH AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH MADE SUPPORTING HER SUPPORT OF HOUSING A USED BY RIGHT AND AS SENATOR WIENER MENTION TO THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND SB FORTY EIGHT WHICH HE HAD LAST YEAR. LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE BY ROAD- WILL OF AN EVIDENCE BASED MODEL FOR SHELTERING INDIVIDUALS AND CONNECTING THEM TO SERVICES KNOWN AS LOW BEAR NAVIGATION CENTERS. THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONTINUE TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS BY REMOVING BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO. SURE THAT HOUSING SIR DOUBLE TO THE LOWEST INCOMES. I HAVE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS TODAY ONE CONCERN VESTMENTS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE DEEPLY TARGETED AND FOCUSED ON THOSE MOST OF REALLY RAMPART AD BY THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA TO REQUIRE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO SET ASIDE A PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS SPECIFICALLY FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO DO NOT NEED SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND GIVE DEVELOPERS THE RESOURCE TO DO. WITH SOMETHING LIKE OPERATE SUBSIDY OR PROJECT BASED RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND THREE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN A RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WHAT WE FACE THIS UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE WE MUST COME AT IT WITH ALL THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO PRODUCING HOMES IN ENSURING THOSE MOST AFFECTED BY THE COSTS OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA ARE PRIORITIZED. THAT IS HOW WE WILL SEE REAL CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND DEDICATION TO THIS ISSUE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M. HOPEFULLY MY PRESENTATION BE UPLOADED IN JUST A SECOND- GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SURE AND REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING  WORK ON STATE POLICY- AND- JUST TO GIVE YOU A TWO SECOND OVERVIEW OF MY ORGANIZATION WE'RE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ARE BURYING CALL IS TO MAKE SURE THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS OF A PLACE THE CALL HOME AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT THRIVE. I'M JUST TOO QUICKLY ECHO THE POINTS THAT CHRIS MARTIN RAISED I DO THINK IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO MOVE FORWARD AROUND HOMELESSNESS WE DEFINITELY NEED TO MAKE A MAKE UP THE GAP AND STOCK OF HOUSING CALIFORNIANS WITH EXTREMELY LOW INCOMES CAN AFFORD. HELP PEOPLE AFFORD HOUSING BY SUBSIDIZING OPERATING AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND ALLOW PEOPLE ACCESS TO HOUSING OF SERVICE HOUSING SERVICES. IN INNOVATING TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS WE SHOULD NEVER OFFER A TINY HOME WITHOUT PLUMBING AS A SOLUTION OR FUND OTHERWISE SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS ARE UNSAFE CONDITIONS AS A WAY TO GET PEOPLE AND HOUSING QUICKLY. AS UNSAFE AND OVERCROWDED HOUSING ARE A RISK FACTOR FOR PEOPLE RETURNING TO HOMELESSNESS. THE STATE SHOULD INNOVATE AN ACCORD MATING RESOURCES AND STREAMLINING MORE QUICKLY- TO BUILD MORE QUICKLY IN FUNDING INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE MARKET LANDLORDS TO ACCEPT RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND IN PROVIDING SERVICES TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACCESS HOUSING AND STAYS DEEPLY HOUSE. ON THAT LAST POINT ON SPENDING SERVICES- WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR CALIFORNIA TO FUND TO CREATE AND FIND A MEDI CAL BENEFIT THAT WOULD FUND HOUSING BASED SERVICES- THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS PRESERVE PROPOSED A REDESIGN. EVER MEDI CAL PROGRAM THAT REDESIGN IS- KNOWN AS CAL AIM BUT CAL AIM DOES NOT OFFER ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND IN FACT LET IT'S FUNDING. HOUSING BASED SERVICES. THE STATE AND OUR COUNTY IS CURRENTLY SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR- I MOSTLY GENERAL FUND DOLLARS ON HOUSING BASED SERVICES WE COULD INSTEAD FOLLOW OTHER STATES LEAD. AND ESTABLISHING STATEWIDE MEDICAID BENEFIT FUNDED 95290% BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I BENEFIT WOULD IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE SERVICES OFFER MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA AND PREVENT PEOPLE NOW HOUSE FROM RETURNING TO HOMELESSNESS. IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL CALIFORNIA COULD BE USING OUR EXISTING RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY RATHER THAN ALLOCATING RESOURCES WITHOUT A COMPASS THE STATE COULD FOLLOW THE LEAD OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND- DOES AND ANALYZING THE GAPS IN OUR RESPONSE. SIMILARLY IF THE STATE HAD A SINGLE CABINET LEVEL POSITION ON HOMELESSNESS DIRECTLY REPORTING TO THE GOVERNOR AS RECOMMENDED BY BOTH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE OUR STATE COULD STANDARDIZE OUR HOUSING AND SERVICES PROGRAMS LOW AT. APPROACHES TAKEN ORALLY AND A AND TING. US AS YOU'VE HEARD OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE HOUSING MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER BEFORE BUT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES CANNOT KEEP PACE. AS ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT AND A LOS ANGELES- LA HAS BEEN HOUSING A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE PEOPLE THAT DAY BUT A HUNDRED FIFTY ARE FONG THE HOMELESSNESS WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE TWELVE. HE'S CLEAN TWENTY AT NINE. SHOW THAT THE THAT IN INEQUALITY WHICH PURCHASE RENTS BEYOND WITH HOUSEHOLDS AND PROPERTY CAN AFFORD AN INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS FEET HOMELESSNESS THESE DATA INDICATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IF TARGETED TO HOUSEHOLDS WITH EXTREMELY LOW INCOMES OR EVEN WELL BELOW EXTREMELY LOW INCOME LEVEL. HOWEVER EVEN CREATING MORE HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO HOUSING WITH EXTREMELY HOUSEHOLDS WITH EXTREMELY LOW INCOMES WAS SEVERE RANT BURDENS IS OVER BROAD AS A PREVENTION RESPONSE. A FEW OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS WILL BECOME HOMELESS ABOUT LESS THAN A THIRD ACTUALLY AND MOST HOMELESS PREVENTION PROGRAMS BROUGHT HER GETTING FAILS TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AMONG PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BECOME HOMELESS WITHOUT THESE PROGRAM. FOR THESE REASONS THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT EFFICIENT AS PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND- THE THIS PROGRAM THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY FROM CHICAGO- PROVIDES SHORT TERM CASH ASSISTANCE TO HOUSEHOLDS FEARING HOMELESSNESS. BUT A RECENT STUDY THAT CAME OUT SO THAT ONLY- LESS THAN 2% ABOUT ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE HELP BY THAT PROGRAM WOULD HAVE BECOME HOMELESS WITHOUT THE PROGRAM. AT THE PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY HAS BY YOU IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN GIVING PEOPLE SHORT TERM FIX BUT WAS NOT REALLY PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM BECAUSE HOME YES. IN FACT THE VAST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FIXING AFFECTION OR REPORT DURING BUSINESS WILL NEVER BE HOMELESS. TURN ANY PENSION RAM IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN CREATING AN EFFICIENT STRATEGY BUT IT'S EXTREMELY TRICKY. A RECENT UCLA POLICY LAB AND UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO POVERTY LAB TO STUDY pINCLUDE PREVIOUS EPISODES OF HOMELESSNESS AND SHARP SURPRISE BIKES AND- COUNTY SERVICES- USAGE SIX MONTHS PRIOR. THE PERSON'S REPORTING THAT THE- TO STAY. FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE STATE SHOULD ENSURE PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE TARGETED TO THOSE AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS DOES AND THAT WOULD BE BASED. ON PREDICT- ALGORITHM OUR PANEL TAKES DATA. AND PREVENTING RETURNS TO HOMELESSNESS IS ALSO CRITICAL STRATEGY A NUMBER OF- OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH PREVIOUS EPISODES OF HOMELESSNESS WHO HAD RECEIVED TEMPORARY RENTAL ASSISTANCE. SUCH AS RAPID RE HOUSING ONLY- FACE HOMELESSNESS ONCE THEIR SUBSIDY ENDED AND ONE CRITICAL STRATEGY AS CHRIS MARTIN MENTIONED COULD BE TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR STATE FUNDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS. HAVE A SET ASIDE FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SO THAT THOSE HOUSEHOLDS ONCE THEIR RENTAL THEIR RAPID RE HOUSING ENDS THERE'S RENTAL ASSISTANCE SUBSIDY ENDS THEY DON'T FALL BACK AND THOMAS SAYS THAT WOULD BE A CRITICAL. PREVENTION STRATEGY. ONE WAY BERKSHIRE PREVENT WOULD BE TO STATE FOR OF HOUSING AS I MENTION SERVICES HOMELESS BENEFICIARIES AND ANOTHER WOULD BE TO DEVELOP PROGRAM- PROTOCOLS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DISCHARGING FROM STATE FUNDED INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS AND A HOMELESSNESS. FROM HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES FROM SUBSTANCE USE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES FROM PRISONS AND JAILS AND FROM FOSTER CARE. DISCHARGED INNING SHOULD TAKE HOUSING INTO ACCOUNT. AND INCLUDE HOUSING NAVIGATION AND SUBSIDIES FOR PEOPLE HAVE WHO HAVE NOWHERE TO GO UPON DISCHARGE. FINALLY I WOULD URGE THAT ANY FUNDING SPENT ON PREVENTION SEPARATE AND APART FROM ANY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO RESOLVE PEOPLE'S HOMELESSNESS SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS A LOT EASIER TO SERVE SOMEBODY WHO'S STILL HOUSE THAN IT IS TO SERVE SOMEBODY WHO'S ON THE STREETS. AND SO I WENT ON A CD- THE LATTER. TRANING THE STORE OF THE FORMER STRATEGY TO GET PEOPLE OFF OF THE STREETS AND INTO HOMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING- OR GOOD AFTERNOON I THINK WE VENTURED INTO THE AFTERNOON BY NOW YEAH- MY NAME'S CHRIS TO ASK ABOUT I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES BRANCH AT THE YMCA OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY I'M ALSO THE VICE CHAIR AND A BOARD MEMBER AT FIVE PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH A STATEWIDE ADVOCACY GROUP THAT'S BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY I'VE I'VE BEEN IN SOCIAL WORK AND I'VE BEEN A SOCIAL WORK PRACTITIONER FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS. AND THIS IS THE MOST ATTENTION I'VE EVER SEEN TO THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL- BUT SPECIFICALLY YOU HOMELESSNESS. AND I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS AND APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION. BUT PARTICULARLY TO THE ISSUE OF YOUTH HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS WHAT ALL ALL TALK ABOUT TODAY. ALL ALL SHARE A COUPLE OF COMPELLING REASONS WHY A FOCUS ON HOMELESS YOUNG PEOPLE IS EXTREMELY CRITICAL. AND BRIFLY DISCUSS WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND FOR US- AS PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD. THE FIRST OUR FIRST VERY COMPELLING REASON. IS THAT- MANY CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ADULTS HAD THEIR FIRST HOMELESS EXPERIENCE BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT HOMELESSNESS DURING AN ADULTHOOD. LEADS TO FUTURE HOMELESSNESS LATER IN LIFE. I THE RECENT STUDIES HAVE TOLD US THAT ANYWHERE FROM A QUARTER ADULTS REPORTED THEIR FIRST HOMELESS EXPERIENCE DURING THE TRANSITION AG TEARS. THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT- IF SOMEBODY BROUGHT YOU A- A SORT OF AT AT INTERVENTION RIGHT NOW THAT COULD CUT CHRONICALLY HOMELESSNESS. BY 25250% TODAY- I THINK WE ALL JUMP ON THAT RIGHT AND YOUNG PEOPLE FOCUSING ON YOUNG PEOPLE WILL ABSOLUTELY DO THAT. AND OUR OUR OUR INVESTMENT DURING THIS TIME ALSO IN TRANSITION AG OF ITS X. SURE ROUTINELY CRITICAL AND IT CAN BE. AIRY LASTING FOR THIS POPULATION ADOLESCENCE IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND MOST PROFOUND PERIOD OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT SECOND ONLY TO THE ZERO FIVE YEARS. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO US WE THINK ABOUT INVESTMENTS BECAUSE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GO VERY FAR TO CREATING BEHAVIOR CHANGE AMONG THIS GROUP- INTERVENTIONS THAT FOCUS ON SELF REGULATION- THAT IS EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING WHICH IS REALLY THE FOUNDATION FOR LIFELONG FUNCTIONING. OUR PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE AND THESE CRITICAL UC'S SKILLS ARE EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE TO INTERVENTION. ADDITIONALLY INTERVENTIONS THAT HELP AT YOUNG PEOPLE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING AND MOANED AND MAINTAINING ROBUST. SOCIAL SUPPORT HELP THEM INCREASE THEIR OWN SOCIAL CAPITAL. THAT CAPITAL PERSISTS LONG AFTER OUR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ARE GONE. AND WE'VE HEARD FOLKS TODAY TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY NET- WHEN WE THINK THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AND SOCIAL CAPITAL HUMANS ARE NATURAL SAFETY NETS AND WE THINK ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE NOT EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO ARE NOT EXPERIENCING SYSTEMS WHO HAVE NOT HAD. THAT TRAUMATIC OR ADVERSE LIFE EXPERIENCES AND THEY'RE STILL RELIANT ON THEIR PARENTS OR OTHER FAMILY UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX AT LEAST. THAT'S THE NEW AVERAGE SO WHEN WE EXPECT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THESE VERY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES TO OPERATE WITHOUT SERVICES THAT FOCUS ON THEIR ABILITY TO SET GOALS. REDUCE BASS MANAGE. AT WORK WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT IN AND SERVING THIS GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE SO FOCUSING SUPPORT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ON THESE CRITICAL SKILL DEVELOPMENT AREAS IS ESSENTIAL. I WE ALSO KNOW WHEN I AND I THINK RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME TO REITERATE THAT- HOUSING FIRST AS DOES NOT MEAN HOUSING ONLY. AND THAT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THIS POPULATION I AND- HOW PROVIDING HOUSING ACCESS TO BASIC NEEDS CERTAINLY REDUCES STRESS SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BEGAN TO USE THEIR BRAINS. I'M MOR EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY TO SET GOALS AND ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS I AM BUT THEY ALSO NEED HUMANS THAT HELP THEM DO THAT. AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT OUR INVESTMENTS ARE STRATEGICALLY. FOCUSED ON INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH MENTAL HEALTH- THAT HAVE TO DO WITH- HIGHER LEVELS OF CASE MANAGEMENT- SO THIS MEANS THAT PROVIDERS NEED TO PAY QUALIFIED STAFF MEMBERS TRAIN NO STAFF MEMBERS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND- BETTER OFF MEMBERS UNDERSTAND BRAIN PAINTS. UNDERSTAND HE'S EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS. I'M AND LAST I THINK. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO SAY THAT INVESTING IN YOUNG PEOPLE WILL SAVE US MONEY IN THE LONG RUN- LA'S ECONOMIC ROUND TABLE- TOLD US IN A RECENT REPORT THAT THAT COST OF THESE INTERVENTIONS- PARTICULARLY ONES THAT ARE ADEQUATELY TARGETED TO THE RIGHT INDIVIDUALS. RESULTS AND AVOIDED PUBLIC COSTS THAT WILL MORE THAN OFFSET THE COST OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS. I HOMELESS YOUTH GO ON TO USE PUBLIC RESOURCES SUCH AS MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME INCARCERATED- THEY HAVE A CONTINUED NEED FOR HOUSING IN SUPPORT OF SERVICE SAYS. AT THE USE CASH EIGHT MORE FREQUENTLY CHILD CARE FOOD STAMPS ON THOSE THINGS ARE ALL VERY EXPENSIVE. IF WE DIVERT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM A LIFE OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS INTO THRIVING TRAJECTORIES NOT ONLY DO YOU SAVE MONEY ON POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS. BUT WE REALIZED THAT. TO ALL AND ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE. NUMBER THREE THROUGH THEIR LAST CREATE OPTIMAL. FOR THE FUTURE. AND THIS IS. BREAKING THE CYCLE. FURTHER THERE'S BEEN A HISTORIC UNDER INVESTMENT IN THIS POPULATION AND WE KNOW SO MUCH MORE NOW ABOUT WHAT WORKS ON AND MANY REGIONS ARE PREPARED TODAY TO DEPLOY APPROPRIATE SERVICE SAYS- THROUGH COORDINATED SYSTEMS LEVELS APPROACHES NOW- SO ON THE GROUND AND YEAH WE AT THE YMCA IN SAN DIEGO SERVE. ALMOST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOUNG PEOPLE AND HOUSING ANNUALLY AND THOSE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE. ACTED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OR EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO SYSTEMS INVOLVEMENT SO WE ARE INTIMATELY I'M AWARE OF THE BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE AND THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE IS WORKING THUS FAR. IS THAT PARTICULARLY EVIDENCED AND KEEP AND HAPPY AND THAT IS AT THE COORDINATED APPROACH THAT'S REQUIRED AT A REGIONAL LEVEL SO THAT FLEXIBILITY I THINK IS A FOURTEEN COMMUNITIES. TO IDENTIFY THE GAPS IN SERVICES THE POPULATIONS OF FOCUS ON AND OBVIOUSLY- AND AT THE CAPACITY BUILDING THAT IT THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE WITH WITHOUT FUNDING. I'M AND I THINK ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW ALL WE ARE BUILDING A AN EFFECTIVE COORDINATED APPROACH TO AND HOMELESSNESS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND- WITH TEN FUNDING. AND FURTHER EVALUATION I THINK WE HEARD THAT AMONG A LOT OF FOLKS TODAY WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WORKS AND STOP DOING THE THINGS THAT DON'T. AND THE- DAY FOCUS ON THIS GROUP MUST. MASS BE A PRIOR AND CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME REALLY APPRECIATE IT. GOOD MORNING SENATOR IS MY NAME IS MAGGIE MERIT AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE. THE SAME BURKE INSTITUTE IS A NON PROFIT PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE. THAT WAS FOUNDED BY A FORMER SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM DARRELL STEINBERG. SACRAMENTO'S CURRENT MAYOR AND WE ARE DEDICATED TO ADVANCING SOUND PUBLIC POLICY AN INSPIRING LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUES OF BRAIN HEALTH. IT IS AN HONOR TO. BE INVITED TO COME AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL ILLNESS NOT ONLY AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE BUT ALSO AS SOMEONE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE. I HAVE EXPERIENCED ABUSE I AM A MEMBER OF THE NEED TO COMMUNITY. WITH MY TWO YOUNG SONS MANY YEARS AGO I DID ESCAPE OF VIOLENT ENVIRONMENT I HEALED FROM A DRUG ADDICTION I. FAILED SUICIDE ATTEMPT AND I LIVE WITH GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER WHICH YOU MIGHT SEE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TODAY THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE. EXPERIENCES IN LIFE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME PRACTICE OF BEING HERE AS MYSELF- AS I SHOW UP. SO YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT BEFORE I START THOUGH I DO WANNA ALSO SAY THANK YOU FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND FOR YOUR COLLABORATION I REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS THE DAY THIS IS THE TIME- FOR US TO COLLABORATE MY HURRIED SO MANY FOLKS SAY THAT WE NEED TO. KIND OF AND THIS PIECEMEAL. KIND OF APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE AND THAT WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND I THINK YOU ARE A MODEL OF THAT COLLABORATION SO I REALLY HONOR YOU FOR THIS THIS WORK. ON YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT HOMELESSNESS ITSELF ALL ELSE GET THOSE NOTES I. THOUGHT I EXIT TEN MINUTES SO I'M GONNA. EDIT WHILE I TALK- OF FOUR YEARS WE BELIEVE THAT ABOUT A QUARTER TO A THIRD. OF THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY WAS MADE UP OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE. THE WITH THE MENTAL AND A MENTAL ILLNESS AND- THANKS TO THAT COMMITTEE STAFF WHO DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF CREATING A REPORT FOR YOU- AND THEY POINTED OUT THAT THE- CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB AT UCLA ACTUALLY DID A TWO YEAR STUDY OF ABOUT SIXTY FOURTH HOUSE AND HOMELESS PEOPLE IN FIFTEEN STATES WHERE THEY FELT WITH IT FOUND THAT IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN AND SHELTERED PEOPLE. WELL DONE AS HAVING A MENTAL ILLNESS THOUGH THEY DIDN'T BREAK OUT FROM YOU KNOW STATE TO STATE THEY FOUND THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- BETWEEN STATES SO SOME EXAMPLES ARE AMONG THE AND SHELTERED. HEALTH CONDITION 78% HAD A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION AND 75% HOW TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE CONDITION. 50% OF THE AND SHELTERED PAUL OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY I HAD ALL THREE PHYSICAL MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE- CHALLENGES SO EVEN AMONG THE HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE SHELTERED LIVING IN SHELTERS ARE ON A FRIEND'S COUCH EXCEPT TRES FIFTY PRIESTS ON 50% REPORTED HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. SELL AMONG AND SHELTERED 50% SAID THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR- BEING AND HOW IS IT COMPARED 217% OF- SHELTERED FOLKS. 51% OF THE AND SHE SAID THE SUBSTANCE USE THAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CONTRIBUTED TO HOMELESSNESS COMPARED 26% OF SHELTERED. FELT BY THE WAY IN MANY PLACES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SAY THEY USE MATH TO STAY AWAKE AT NIGHT- TO PROTECT THEMSELVES SO WHICH FURTHER EXACERBATES THE RATE OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ON THE STREETS. A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAID THAT- TRAUMA OR ABUSE CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR HOMELESSNESS. 38% OF ON SHELTERED MEN HAD EXPERIENCED TRAUMA AND 80% OF AND SHELTERED WOMEN HAD EXPERIENCED TRAUMA. AS LA COUNTY IS THAT DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR DR JONATHAN SHARE AND SOMETIMES POINTS OUT THE CLOSING OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH ASYLUMS BACK IN THE REAGAN ERA. WITH THE CORRESPONDING FAILURE TO OPEN THE AND INTENDED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS GAVE RISE TO TWO NEW TYPES OF A SILENCE. THE INDOOR ASYLUM WHICH IS NOW KNOWN AS OUR IS KNOWN AS OUR JAILS AND PRISONS. AND OUR OUTDOOR ASYLUM WHICH IS KNOWN AS HOMELESSNESS AND WE CAN SEE THAT TO BE TRUE IF YOU HAVE NOT YET VISITED THE LA COUNTY JAIL. IT'S SOMETHING I WOULD RECOMMEND- IT'S IT WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOUR MEMORY AND IT WILL FUEL THE FIRE YOU ALREADY HAVE AND PASSION YOU HAVE AROUND ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. MENTAL ILLNESS DOES NOT NEED TO BE A LIFE SENTENCE OF DYSFUNCTION WE MUST REMOVE BARRIERS THAT MAKE ACCESSING CARE POSSIBLE WE NEED A WIDE VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS TO COME ONLINE NOW. SOME SOLUTIONS INCLUDE TRAINING PROFESSIONALS WHO INTERACTED WITH OUR CHILDREN AND OUR YOUTH ABOUT TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND ABOUT AND HOW TO IDENTIFY EARY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF MENTAL HEALTH OR MENTAL ILLNESS AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT CARE IS ACCESSIBLE WE NEED TO FOCUS ON EARLY PSYCHOSIS IDENTIFICATION AND SCALE THAT PRACTICE UP ACROSS THE STATE. WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT INCREASING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. ACROSS THE STATE AND WE MUST SEE TO IT THAT THERE REALLY IS TRUE PARITY IN BOTH THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS AS IT RELATES TO PROVIDING ONGOING CARE TO THOSE WHO LIVE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS. AND OR IS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER JUST AS WE DO FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH. WE ALSO REALLY NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE. WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE WHO LIVE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS IN OUR PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE SO MANY FOLKS ARE UNABLE TO THRIVE IN THEIR WORKPLACE BECAUSE WE JUST NEED AS EMPLOYERS TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT HOW WE A CALM. THESE FOLKS AND IF THEY'RE NOT A COMMON NEEDED AND THEY'RE NOT- THRIVING THAN THEY OFTEN LOSE THEIR JOB. LOSING THEIR EMPLOYMENT LEAD TO HOMELESSNESS SO LET'S REALLY START THINKING ABOUT THAT. AND AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY WE NEED TO SCALE UP WHOLE PERSON CARE IT'S THE IT WORKS AND WE KNOW IT WORKS AND WE ALSO NEED TO SEE HOUSING AS A VITAL COMPONENT OF THAT CARE IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS TO STABILIZE WHILE LIVING. ON THE STREETS WE- DURING HIS STATE OF THIS GOVERNOR NEW SOME SOMEWHAT OFF HANDEDLY- SAYING THAT HE THOUGHT THAT DOCTORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR HOUSING. AND AT THE SAME AGAINST IF YOU WILL WE AGREE WITH THAT. WITHOUT A STABLE HOUSE THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION INTO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND RECOVERY ARE MONUMENTAL AND SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE. I HAVE MULTIPLE PAGES. GOING ON SO I'M GOING TO JUST SAY THAT THE OTHER ISSUES AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO OUR BOARDING CARE. OUT WE'RE LOSING THEM AT AN ALARMING RATE AND THOSE FOLKS ARE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS. WE DO THE LPS ACT WAS MENTIONED TODAY WE HAVE THE STATE AUDITOR DOING AN AUDIT OF THAT APPLICATION OF LPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE RIGHT NOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO. THAT REPORT IN APRIL. WE NEED TO LOOK AT NO PLACE LIKE HOME OF- PROGRAMS THAT THE SAME BURKE INSTITUTE SPONSORED- AS AN OPTION FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF HOUSING BEYOND HIS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND- WE NEED TO LOOK AT WORKFORCE ISSUES SO AT THAT I'LL JUST LEAVE IT WITH THAT WE ALSO I SHOULDN'T. MISS THIS ONE. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE TARGETED TOWARD TOLD. TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FEDERAL CASKEY THROUGH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. NO CORRECT. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN AND I THANK YOU I KNOW I WORKERS WORKING TOGETHER ON ON- AN OFFER NOT SUPPOSED TO MENTION CIRCLE RACIAL HEARINGS BUT- SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE TO ENSURE THAT I- INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY COVERING ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY. MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CARER- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE HEARING- WE'VE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE. ARE GIVEN CARE WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY IN CRISIS CENTER NOT GIVING CARE IN ORDER TO PREVENT A CRISIS IT'S SORT OF. LIKE SAYING WELL WE KNOW YOU HAVE STAGE ONE CANCER BUT WILL COVER YOU ONCE YOU'RE AT STAGE FOR- AND THEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN COMPLAIN WEALTHY FORCES TO COVER STATE ONE CANCER. THAT'LL JUST BE MORE EXPENSIVE AND COULD AFFECT OUR PREMIUMS IT'S AN ABSURD ARGUMENT- AND WE WOULD NEVER WE WILL. BE WITH ALL LEFT THEM OUT OF THE ROOM IF THEY MADE THAT ARGUMENT AROUND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND YET WE TOLERATE THAT ARGUMENT. AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION WHICH ARE ALSO MAJOR HEALTH CHALLENGES SO. THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US ON THAT. OKAY WELL I WE DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- TIME TODAY AND FOR YOUR INSIGHTS SO THAT IS- IT OUR FINAL PANEL I WILL NOW. OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENTS- IF THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY PALM COUNTIES COME FORWARD. COULDN'T LIBBY SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH BOTH TO THE SENATORS AND STAFF FOR PUTTING TOGETHER SUCH AN INFORMATIVE HEARING ON AS WAS MADE CLEAR THERE'S NO PANACEA THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL FIX. BITES THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS OF THE HOMELESS THAT I'M VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU COVERING TODAY NOT JUST LIMITING THE HEARING TO THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS IN THOSE WITH MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT THE 75% OF THE POPULATION OF HOMELESS WITH JORDAN COOLEY HOMELESS FAMILIES STRUGGLING AND FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. CHILDREN ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN TO HELP WE ARE THE PUBLIC SOCIAL SAFETY NET- IN YOUR COUNTIES WE ARE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS WE ARE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WE ARE SOCIAL WORKERS WE ARE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES PERSON AT ALL. BUT WE ARE STRETCHED PAPER THAN IN OUR BRICK AND MORTAR CAP PARTMINER PERSONAL SERVICES OFFICES WE GET CALLS ALL THE TIME FROM COUNTY PARTNER SAYING PLEASE SEND ELIGIBILITY WORKERS OUT TO OUR FACILITY PLEASE SEND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AT. A SENATOR BELL MENTIONED WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH FOSTER YOUTH HOMELESS ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND LOCAL STATE COLLEGES AND THE PROBLEM IS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO ARE ABLE TO OUT. TO THE OLD SO. OUT OF THE GATE THIS THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. TO CONSIDER OUT STATIONING. MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS OF COUNTY WORKERS AT PLACES LIKE LIBRARIES SCHOOLS JAILS COURTHOUSES HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ANYWHERE WHERE WE CAN HELP BECAUSE WE ARE HERE TO DO THE WORK WE JUST NEED TO BE OUT THERE IN THE FIELD TO DO IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M TYLER IN THE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION- WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT- IN TODAY'S POPULATION EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION HAS. A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER- WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LAPSE STUDY WHEN WE LOOK DEEPLY AT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED IT WAS ASKING OF WHETHER THE PERSON HAD EVER HAD A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AND IT DID NOT TALK ABOUT THEIR CURRENT CONDITION- WELL I'M THAT THEY HAD A WHETHER THEY WERE LIVING ON THE STREETS TODAY WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE LONGER THAT SOMEONE ENDS UP EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON THE STREETS THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO DEVELOP CAN BUT ONE WE'VE LOOKED AT THE- AT THE RESEARCH COMING OF. I'M BY DOCTOR COULD. IN THE- ABOUT 2% OF THE POT MISSION AT SIX IN HOMELESS TODAY NEEDS I PERMAN SUPPORT HOUSING. AND THAT THERE'S THE OTHER A PER OF THAT. PREVENTION WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF DOLLARS THE ROAD FOR THAT SO THAT THEY DO NOT DEVELOP THIS YEAR'S MENTAL ILLNESS AND NEED TO BE INNER HAVE INTERVENTIONS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT WE ARE LOSING OUR BOARDING CARE FACILITIES AT A VERY RAPID RATE TODAY- THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS LOST OVER FORTY FIVE FACILITIES. AND TWELVE HUNDRED BATS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND THEN ON THAT IT'S REPLICATED ACROSS THE STATE IN OTHER COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS REALLY IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO- YOU KNOW HOW WITH THE CRISIS- WE HAVE THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE EITHER. AT RISK OF EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR IT IS A- THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE. TRANSITION PRIVATE PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE FORMERLY HOMELESS IN A STUDY THAT SERVER DISCO HAD DONE THEY HAD SEEN THAT- SO THEIR ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES- 94% OF THE- FACILITIES HAD. HAD A PER IN THERE FOR SO WHO HOW BEEN PRE. HOME LAST SO IT'S REALLY IMPACT IN OUR ABILITY TO ARM YOU KNOW HELP THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION THANK YOU. CAN LUIS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOU THEN- THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING TODAY AND THAT SPECIAL FOCUS PARTICULARLY ON YOUTH- BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NEVER REPRESENTATION- AB LGBTQ YOUTH AND ARE HOMELESS POPULATION AS WELL AS YOUTH OF COLOR- AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO THEM ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE. AND EMBODY A POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MODELS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM THROUGH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT KRISTA HIGHLIGHTED AROUND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE FOR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. AND APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND IT IS A DIFFERENT INTERVENTION FOR SOME OF THESE YET THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO GO HOME TO. AND SO I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS WHO HAVE CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN YOU KNOW I STILL GO HOME TO GO TO MY- AND STAY THERE IF I NEEDED TO BUT MANY OF THESE KIDS DON'T FEEL SAFE RETURNING TO THEIR HOME ENVIRONMENTS AND SO. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE SAFETY NET IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM AND NOT MUCH OF A SAFETY NET. AND SO BUT AS I THAT HAS BEEN DONE THE LAST COUPLE YEARS BY THIS LEGISLATURE WAS CRITICAL TO GET COMMUNITIES THINKING ABOUT ONE OF THE SAFETY NET NEEDED FOR OUR YOUTH PARTICULARLY. CONCERNED CURRENTLY TO CONTINUE PARTS GOING FOR THIS YEAR AND IT. THE EDGE IF AS FOR HAVE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MEMBERS CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND TO ECHO. C&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; SENTIMENT IS FOR INCLUDING DISCUSSION OF YOUTH HOMELESSNESS SENATE HEARING- I'M HERE TO- I'M- I'M SIMONE DIRECTLY I'M-HERE FROM JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH. AND I'M HERE TO ENSURE THAT. THAT WE ADDRESS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AS WE- PLAN AND THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS HOMELESS IS GENERALLY IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS- THE FIRST IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. ONE WAY TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS AMONGST FOSTER YOUTH IS TO CREATE A HOUSING SUPPLEMENT TO STRENGTHEN THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PLACEMENT FOR NON MINOR DEPENDENCE TEACH PMD PROVIDE HOUSING AND IMPORTANT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. TO OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS EACH YEAR AND RIGHT NOW THE HOUSING CRISIS IS THREATENING THIS PLACEMENT OPTION- SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE COST OF HOUSING. HAS INCREASED 64% BUT THE RATE PAID FOR THIS PLACEMENT FOR YOU PER MONTH HAS INCREASE JUST 24% AND THIS IS A- IT THREE HAD FORTY ONE YOUTH ON THE WAITING LIST AS OF LAST JUNE THIRTIETH. THAT'S A 60% BASIC MUST BE BETTER NUMBER HERE AND STATE OR PROP. OF NOT OF ON THE WAY LIST AND MANY OF THESE ON THE THAT THERE HOW. AND SOME OF THEM ARE PARENTS AND MEMBER- FILL TING HAS INTRODUCED AB TO ANY EIGHT EIGHTY WHICH WOULD CREATE A HOUSING SUPPLEMENT AND COUNTIES WHERE THE COST OF HOUSING HAS OUT. BUT THE TEACHER DO YOU EAT AND SUB DRAWDOWN TITLE FORTY. FIVE FINDING. MY SECOND RUN. IS ENSURE THAT THE FOR ANY FUNDING THAT INCLUDED IN IN THE STATE BUDGET TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS INCLUDES A YOUTH SATISFIED- THIS APPROACH WITH UTILIZED THE LAST TWO BUDGET CYCLES AND IT'S WORKING- WE'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON IT KEEP IMPLEMENTATION OF HEAT FUNDING OF THE YOUTH SET ASIDE FUNDING. AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT ACTUALLY THE MINIMUM THE FIVE PERSON. UNITIES AS A WHOLE STATEWIDE ACTUALLY SPENT TEN POINT 8% AND IT'S HELPING THEM BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. AND ALSO ADDRESSING AT A LOCAL LEVEL MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED TODAY THAT SCENE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO I JUST URGE YOU TO SUPPORT INCLUDING A SATISFIED. I IN THE BOB THIS COMING YEAR'S BUDGET AS WELL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CODY I'M TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD- I'M HERE WITH JOHN BYRNE'S ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH I WANT TO ADDRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A YOU'VE SET ASIDE- I EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WHEN I TURNED EIGHTEEN- AFTER I WAS KICKED OUT OF MY FOSTER PLACEMENT. I TRY TO FIND USE HOMELESS SERVICES AND WAS AN ABLE TO RECEIVE ANY SERVICES. I TRIED IT AT THE END TO GET INTO ADULT SHELTERS. AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE EVEN MORE TRAUMATIC FOR ME- THEY WERE NOT SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF ME COMING FROM A DRAMATIC BACKGROUND. I WAS EMOTIONALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY ARE. I HAD AN OUTSIDE SUPPORT THERE WITH ME AT THE TIME THAT I WAS TRYING TO GET INTO THE SHELF. AND THEY HAD ACTIVELY TìM OUT. OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SETTLED IN AND LOCK THE GATES AND BEING SURROUNDED BY YOUR- AT EIGHTEEN AND TRYING TO OPEN UP. EMOTIONALLY TO THE PEOPLE PROVIDING SERVICES- IT WAS NOT HEALTHY FOR ME I WAS VISIBLY. TRAUMATIZED AND THEY DIDN'T. OFFER SYMPATHY TOWARDS THAT- SO I WANT TO SAY THAT HAVING ASIDE- FUNDING- AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED SUPPORTING THE AB. TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY. FOUR FOUGHT FOR YOU WANT SURE THAT CURRENTLY. ST HOW. TO GET IS IT HAVE. CONTACT I DID WORK IN FRONT LISTENING. I'M AND I HOPE TO ADDRESS THAT ON THE PANEL WHAT HAD WAS MENTION WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH FOR I'VE STRUGGLED A LOT MY AND WHEN I DID FOR SEE WITH HOUSE I STARTED REALIZING A LOT OF THINGS ARE COMING UP FROM MY PASS AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS STABLE I WAS DOING WELL IN SCHOOL. AND MY MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER HEAD IT LET ME KNOW THAT WHEN SOMEONE BECOMES STABLE. THERE ARE PROVIDED THE SPACE TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH. SO HOUSING IS THE FIRST STEP FOR US YOU TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME OUR PAST AND OUR TRAUMA. WITHOUT THAT IT BECOMES TEN TIMES ORDER FOR US TO. OF ALL INTO FUNCTIONING ADULT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. SAME NUMBER WAS PUBLIC COMMENT- AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR HEARING ON BEHALF OF. CENTER HER TODD OWN CENTER MCGUIRE I WANT TO. THANK EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED NOT AS A LOT OF WORK- THIS YEAR IN THIS AREA I DON'T KNOW WE'RE WORKING WITH A LOT OF THESE WITNESSES I LOOK FORWARDTO IT- SO WITH THAT. THE RESULT. IS HEARING IS ADJOURNED. THANK YOU.
