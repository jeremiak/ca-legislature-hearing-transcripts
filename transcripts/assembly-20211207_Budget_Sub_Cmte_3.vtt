00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:39.237
DRAMATIC HERE EIGHTEEN OF THAT

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:41.039
AT THAT TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:42.807
WILDFIRES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:45.376
TWO THOUSAND. AND FULLY SEVEN AM

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:47.145
OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE TWENTY

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:48.379
WITH INSTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES WHAT

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:49.747
HAPPENED JUST IN THE LAST FEW

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:52.016
YEARS. SO WE'VE REALLY SEEN A

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:52.917
DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:56.154
DESTRUCTIVE ABOUT PRIOR TO THE

00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:57.322
STATE HAS EXPERIENCED. THIS NEXT

00:30:57.388 --> 00:30:59.824
SLIDE SHOWS A MAP OF CALIFORNIA

00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:01.859
WITH THOSE TWENTY AND MOST

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:04.329
DESTRUCTIVE LARGEST WILDFIRES ON

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:05.563
THE LOCATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.731
MATTERS. AND THESE ARE THE ONES

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:07.599
THAT OCCURRED SINCE TWO

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:09.667
THOUSAND. AND YOU CAN SEE HOW

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:11.369
THIS IS IN A REGIONAL PROBLEM

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:12.804
IT'S NOT JUST A LOCAL PROBLEM

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.172
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS A

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:16.074
WIDE SWATH OF THE STATE. AND OF

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.342
COURSE THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:19.043
EXTEND BEYOND JUST THE BORDERS

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.279
OF THE WILDFIRES- AS WE ALL

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:23.514
EXPERIENCED IN RECENT YEARS-

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:25.316
WELL THE MOST OF YOUR IMPACTS

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:27.919
OUR COMMUNITY AREAS THAT BRING

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:29.587
THEMSELVES- IMPACTED AS SMOKE

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:31.456
THAT CAN EXTEND WELL BEYOND THE

00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:32.590
BORDERS OF WILDFIRES THAT REALLY

00:31:32.657 --> 00:31:34.959
THIS IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:35.493
ISSUE FOR THE STATE SET TO

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.997
TACKLE. THIS NEXT SLIDE SHOWS

00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:40.665
STATE SPENDING ON HEALTH FIRE

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:41.232
AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BRING

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:42.834
ABOUT THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.003
YOU CAN SEE IT'S PRETTY DRAMATIC

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:45.503
FROM ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.171
MILLION. TO THREE POINT FOUR

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:49.274
BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.942
ONE SO- IT'S REALLY GROWN PRETTY

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:53.244
DRAMATICALLY. THIS FIGURE BREAKS

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:55.747
OUT HELLFIRE AND THE CALPERS

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:56.481
BUDGET INTO THREE MAIN

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:58.249
CATEGORIES. BASED FIRE

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:00.585
PROTECTION AND YOU CAN SEE THAT-

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:03.021
HAS PRETTY STEADILY INCREASED

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.055
OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS OR

00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:06.524
SO- EMERGENCY FIRE SUPPRESSION

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:07.492
AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHEN

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:08.860
FIGHTERS EXCEED THE INITIAL

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:10.528
ATTACK SO WHEN WE HAVE LARGER

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:13.197
WILDFIRES- AND HEALTHCARE NEEDS

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:14.332
TO IT TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.134
RESOURCES TO FIGHT THOSE. AND

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.268
YOU CAN SEE THAT VARIES FROM

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:18.169
YEAR TO YEAR AND THAT'S NOT

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:20.538
SURPRISING ON MANY YEARS WE HAVE

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:21.773
PARTICULARLY SEVERE WILDFIRES WE

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:24.075
SEE- ABOUT THE NET EMERGENCY

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:26.277
FIRE SUPPRESSION SPENDING. AND

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:27.345
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FIRE

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:28.646
PREVENTION AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:30.515
THAT WAS PRETTY STEADY FOR A

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:31.382
NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT'S

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:33.351
INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS WITH

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:34.986
THE ADDITION OF FUNDS FROM THE

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.354
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND-

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.122
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. AND

00:32:38.189 --> 00:32:39.424
THAT'S REALLY THAT THIS LIFE

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.224
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:41.993
ABOUT FOCUSING ON AT THIS AND

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.262
THIS HEARING- AND IT IS NOTABLE

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:46.130
THAT IT'S AND WE'VE MADE. A LOT

00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:47.999
OF ADDITIONAL- INVEST

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:49.634
INVESTMENTS IN THAT AREA OVER

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:52.704
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- BUT

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.038
IT'S STILL IT'S A RELATIVELY

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:55.973
SMALL SHARE I'M STILL FIRE

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.141
PROTECTION AND FIRE SUPPRESSION

00:32:57.208 --> 00:33:00.044
ARE. ARE LARGER AND IN IN IN

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:02.213
TOTAL SO- HOPEFULLY IT GETS A

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.848
LITTLE BIT OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:04.782
NOW I'M GONNA TALK JUST A LITTLE

00:33:04.849 --> 00:33:10.688
BIT ABOUT THE FUNDING. THAT WAS

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:11.823
PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:13.191
THERE TO. PACKAGES THAT WERE BY

00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:14.559
THE LATEST IN FOR TWENTY ONE.

00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:15.460
THE FIRST ONE AS- AND EARLY

00:33:15.526 --> 00:33:17.395
ACTION WHILE. PASS THAT WEIGHS A

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:19.497
- IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:20.998
THAT PROVIDED FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.700
THIRTY SIX MILLION FOR A VARIETY

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:24.702
OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROGRAMS.

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:26.437
ACROSS THE STATE TO EUROPE ABOUT

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:27.772
TWO DOZEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:29.807
ACROSS ABOUT FOURTEEN DIFFERENT

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:31.476
DEPARTMENTS. THAT WAS THE

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:33.077
FUNDING AND REALLY THAT FUNDING

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:35.480
WAS- IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING

00:33:35.546 --> 00:33:37.749
IS PROVIDED IN A TWENTY TWENTY

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:38.783
TWENTY ONE BUDGET- BUT IT WAS

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.118
REALLY PART OF THAT BUDGET THAT

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:41.519
WITH ANOTHER ON PETITIONS THAT

00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:43.821
BUDGET. MOST OF THE FUNDING WAS

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:45.256
PROVIDED FROM THE GENERAL FUND

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:47.158
SO IN TOTAL IT WAS I CAN

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:49.527
COMPLETE ABOUT TWO FOUR HUNDRED

00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:50.194
ELEVEN MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:52.397
FROM THE GENERAL FUND. HUNDRED

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:53.297
TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAS PROVIDED

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:54.565
FROM G. G. R. AFTER GREENHOUSE

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:56.667
GAS REDUCTION FUND. AND THE IDEA

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:57.869
BEHIND THAT WAS TO BRING THE

00:33:57.935 --> 00:34:00.104
TEACHER OF SPENDING TO TWO

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:00.805
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:03.040
CONSISTENT WITH SB NINE OH ONE.

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:05.476
AMEND THAT BILL HAD. INDICATED

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:06.511
THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:08.146
INTENDED TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED

00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:10.715
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ANNUALLY

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:12.016
FOR FIVE YEARS. AND THEN THE

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:13.918
EARLY ACTION PACKAGE ALSO IT'S

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.319
REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:16.521
THE REASON WHY IT WASDONE AS AN

00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:18.523
EARLY ACTION PACKAGE WISE. BUT

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:19.390
THE GOAL IS TO GET THE FINDING

00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:21.259
OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT WAS

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:22.593
TO DEDICATE THE FUNDS TOWARDS

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.861
PROJECT THAT WE'RE BASICALLY

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:25.663
READY TO GO. AND I CAN GET

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.698
STARTED IMMEDIATELY AND THAT WAY

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.233
AND THOSE PROJECT THE IDEA WOULD

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.134
BE THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD BE IN

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:31.369
PLACE ROUGHLY A YEAR SOONER THAN

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:33.638
THEY WOULD BE OTHERWISE AND IF.

00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:35.640
THE FUNDING HAD BEEN AND HAD

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:38.409
BEEN INCLUDED IN A TWENTY TWENTY

00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:40.511
ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET. AND

00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:41.245
I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:43.014
ABOUT THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.449
BUDGET- THAT WAS ANOTHER.

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:46.551
HISTORIC AUGMENTATION SO THAT

00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:48.186
BUDGET PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL

00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:49.420
NINE HUNDRED. AND EIGHTY EIGHT

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:51.122
MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A WIDE

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:53.558
RANGE OF PROGRAMS- ABOUT THIRTY

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:54.859
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS MANAGED BY

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:55.660
ABOUT EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.762
APARTMENTS. AGAIN MOST OF THAT

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:59.897
MONEY WAS GOING TO GENERAL FUND.

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:00.498
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:02.733
MILLION. A TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

THERE A COUPLE OTHER IMPORTANT

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:08.206
ASPECTS AND THAT PACKAGE. SEVEN

00:35:08.272 --> 00:35:09.540
THERE WAS A TRAILER BILL THAT

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:10.975
ADDED LANGUAGE THE CONTINUING.

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:13.411
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATES. I

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:14.846
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:16.481
DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY TWO HUNDRED

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:21.285
MILLION. I'M STARTING IN. TWENTY

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:21.853
TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THREE

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:22.453
TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE SO- I

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.120
KNOW THAT YOU'RE MENTIONED THAT.

00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:24.589
BEFORE BUT IT'S A REALLY

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:29.026
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT- BUDGET

00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:29.660
PACKAGE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

00:35:29.727 --> 00:35:30.962
AGAIN. I THE BUDGET. INCLUDED

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:32.029
SOME REPORT LANGUAGE WE THINK IS

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:33.464
REALLY I'M REALLY BURKE

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:35.199
HIGHLIGHTING AS WELL. AND THAT

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:36.868
REPORTING LINK LANGUAGE REQUIRES

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:38.336
ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTRATION

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:39.770
EXCUSE ME TO PROVIDE CERTAIN

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:41.472
INFORMATION ON ALL OF THAT. A

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:42.974
WILDFIRE RESILIENCE FUND THAT

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.009
WERE PROVIDED BOTH IN TWENTY

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:45.977
TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY DEAL AS

00:35:46.043 --> 00:35:47.078
WELL AS THE EARLY ACTION MONEY

00:35:47.144 --> 00:35:48.913
THAT WAS PROVIDED IN TWENTY

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.915
TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BUT WILL ELP

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.517
LEGISLATURE. I UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:54.385
WAS FUNDED IT WITH THOSE- THOSE

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:57.655
DOLLARS AND- WHAT WHAT AND WHAT

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:00.992
WE REALLY GOT FROM FROM ALL THAT

00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:03.361
HISTORIC INVESTMENT. SO THE NEXT

00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:05.062
FIGURED THIS IS BY CATEGORY BUT

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.464
THIS REALLY SHOWS THOSE EARLY

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:10.201
ACTION AND BUDGET ACT- PACKAGES.

00:36:10.268 --> 00:36:11.102
AND IT BREAKS IT OUT BY

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:13.104
CATEGORIES THERE ARE FIVE MAIN

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:13.771
CATEGORIES THAT RECEIVED

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:16.507
FUNDING. YOU CAN SEE THE FUNDS

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:17.441
WERE APPROPRIATED AS WELL AS

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.510
THE- PERCENTAGES HAVE BEEN

00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:21.746
COMMITTED BASS BAR. AND IT'S I

00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:22.980
THINK THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I

00:36:23.047 --> 00:36:24.248
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ABOUT THIS

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:27.385
FIGURE FOR YOU- WHAT YOU CAN SEE

00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:29.220
HOW THE FUNDING WAS DISTRIBUTED

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:31.088
AMONG THOSE GUYS MAIN CATEGORIES

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:32.823
OF EXPENDITURES IN THIS AREA.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:33.824
YOU CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:35.526
FUNDING FOR BOTH PACKAGES WENT

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:36.561
TO RESILIENT FORESTS AND

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:38.095
LANDSCAPES SURPRISE SO PROGRAMS

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:40.131
THAT REALLY EMPHASIZE THAT. ON

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:41.832
THE SECOND LARGEST SHARE WAS FOR

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:43.668
WILDFIRE FUEL BREAKS- AND THEN

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:44.669
THEY WERE SMALLER DOLLAR

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:45.970
APPLICATIONS FOR COMMUNITY

00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:50.808
HARDENING. FOR SECTOR ECONOMIC.

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:51.342
STIMULUS AND SCIENCE BASED

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:52.610
MANAGEMENT- YOU CAN ALSO SEE.

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:55.980
THAT A LARGE FRACTION OF A LARGE

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.014
SHARE OF THE EARLY ACTION

00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:59.216
FUNDING HAS BEEN COMMITTED

00:36:59.283 --> 00:37:00.451
EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. AND A

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:03.321
SMALLER SHARE OF THAT OF THE

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:03.888
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:04.956
DOLLARS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:07.792
THAT'S PART ONLY SEVEN PERCENT-

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:08.726
NOW THAT'S NOT REALLY

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:10.528
SURPRISING. FOR A COUPLE REASONS

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:12.496
WHY OF COURSE THE BUDGET- THE

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:13.598
BUDGET ACTION BUT LATER IN THE

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:14.398
YEAR THAN THE EARLY ACTION

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:16.233
PACKAGE BUT ALSO. THERE REALLY

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.401
ACTION PACKAGE AS I MENTIONED

00:37:17.468 --> 00:37:18.803
BEFORE WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.671
PROJECTS THAT WERE READY TO GO

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:21.872
AND THE IDEA WAS THAT THOSE

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:23.341
COULD BE COMMITTED VERY QUICKLY

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:24.475
AND SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:25.843
WE SAW THOSE DOLLARS. HE

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.478
COMMITTED MORE QUICKLY. WITH

00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:29.113
THAT WITH A BUDGET ALLOCATION

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.148
THE IDEA WAS THAT YOU KNOW THAT

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:32.149
THAT FUNDING WOULD PROBABLY BE

00:37:32.216 --> 00:37:33.884
USED OVER AND OVER A-

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:35.419
POTENTIALLY A PERIOD OF A FEW

00:37:35.486 --> 00:37:36.921
YEARS. AND SO IT'S NOT

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:37.955
SURPRISING THAT SOME OF THOSE

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:40.858
DOLLARS HAVE HAVEN'T. BEEN

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.727
COMMITTED YET. I'M YOU CAN ALSO

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:44.462
SEE THAT. THERE'S VARIATION IN

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:45.296
THE PERCENT THAT'S BEEN

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.264
COMMITTED CATEGORIES SO YOU CAN

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:49.567
SEE THAT. OVERALL AND HIGHER

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:51.469
SHARE HAS BEEN COMMINGLED FOR

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:52.503
THEIR RESILIENT FORESTS AND

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:53.771
LANDSCAPES CATEGORY IN THE

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:55.706
WILDFIRE FUEL BREAKS CATEGORY.

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:56.240
AS WELL AS A SCIENCE BASED

00:37:56.307 --> 00:37:59.143
MANAGEMENT CATEGORY- THEN FOR

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.511
EXAMPLE THE COMMUNITY HARDENING

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:01.979
AND THE FOUR SECTORS STIMULUS

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:04.048
CATEGORIES. SO WANTED TO

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:05.182
HIGHLIGHT THAT YOU CAN GET THE

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:06.917
OVERALL PICTURE. AND THEN THE

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.953
NEXT TWO FIGHTS BREAK THESE

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.354
CATEGORIES OUT INTO THE

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:12.823
INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS. THAT'S THAT

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:13.791
WAY YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:15.926
SOME. SEPARATION AND LOOK AT A

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:19.997
DIFFERENT STORY FOR CHRISTMAS.

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.832
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. HELLO THIS IS

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.234
FIRST HALF OF THE TWO PEOPLE

AND WE CAN IT ALL AND ONE FIVE

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:32.710
AND HAVE IT BE. AN WHY. I'M HERE

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.111
YOU CAN SEE FOR WITHIN WITH. FOR

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:36.013
SOMEONE'S. OVER ON 93% OF THE

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.648
EARLY ACTION FUNDING HAS BEEN

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:39.450
COMMITTED THUS FAR. BUT THERE IS

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:40.885
VARIATION ACROSS DIFFERENT

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:42.486
PROGRAMS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:38:42.553 --> 00:38:45.923
FOREST HEALTH PROGRAM- YOU KNOW.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.058
ALL ABOUT FUNDING HAS BEEN

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:48.926
COMMITTED WHERE YOU CAN SEE FOR

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.394
EXAMPLE THAT AND YOU KNOW

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:52.263
RESOURCE NEEDS REFORESTATION

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:54.498
NURSERY. URBAN FORESTRY INTERVAL

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:55.800
AND GAUGE MEANT ON BEHALF I

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:57.268
THINK COMMITTEE YEAH. AND I DID

00:38:57.334 --> 00:38:59.170
WANT TO NOTE HERE ALSO JUST ON

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:00.805
WHAT COMMITTED MEANS THAT

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:01.572
SOMETIMES THAT CAN BE A LITTLE

00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:03.307
BIT OF A CONFUSING TERMS.

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:04.909
USUALLY THAT MEANS ALLOCATED TO

00:39:04.975 --> 00:39:06.711
PROJECTS OR MEDIA GRANT

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:08.379
AGREEMENT SAYS IS SIGN THOSE

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.081
KINDS OF THINGS- IT DOESN'T

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:11.148
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE

00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:12.650
PROJECT HAS HAS BEEN COMPLETED

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:14.385
SO COULD STILL TAKE SOME TIME

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:16.153
FOR THIS PROJECT. ACTUALLY THE

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.055
FULLY IN PLACE AND OPERATIONAL

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:19.957
BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THAT THE

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:22.460
MONEY HAS BEEN. ALLOCATED AND

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:27.331
IT'S SORT OF YEAH. IT'S IN PLACE

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:28.265
AND DEDICATED. I SO THIS IS THE

00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:29.900
FIRST HAPPEN AT. AND THEN THIS

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:31.635
HALF THE TABLE JUST SHOWS- AND

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:34.071
THE REMAINING PROGRAMS SO YOU

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.073
CAN SEE KIND OF THAT THE STATUS

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.610
OF THOSE AND THEN I. AM THE WAY

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:40.211
THAT THAT FUNDING IS GOING OUT

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:42.213
AS WELL. SEN AND THAT CONCLUDES

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:43.447
MY PRESENTATION I'M HAPPY TO

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:46.617
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS- THAT MANY

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:51.956
HEALTH. THANK YOU- CAN YOU OFFER

00:39:52.022 --> 00:39:55.192
SOME- COMMENTS ARE JUST-

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:56.360
EXPLANATION WHY THERE'S SUCH A

00:39:56.427 --> 00:40:00.564
DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- IN

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:01.866
TERMS OF THE PERCENT COMMITTED

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:03.267
ON THE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:06.036
BETWEEN RESILIENT FORESTS AND

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.805
FUEL BREAKS FOR EXAMPLE AND

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:09.907
COMMUNITY HARDENING IN THE FOR

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.709
SECTOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS THOSE

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:14.979
ARE PRETTY DRAMATIC. DROP OFFS.

00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:17.114
YEAH AND THAT MAYBE SOMETHING

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:19.016
THAT- THAT THE MINISTRATION

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.351
WOULD BE BETTER POSITIONED AND

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:23.287
TO- TO TALK ABOUT BUT MIGHT I

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:24.989
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS TECH AND

00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:27.258
KNOWS IS THAT SOME OF A LOT OF

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:28.259
THE FUNDING IN THE EARLY ACTION

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:29.493
PACKAGE WENT TO ESTABLISH

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.162
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:33.998
FOR SEVERAL YEARS- AND THAT. IN

00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:35.833
GENERAL IT TENDS TO BE EASIER TO

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:36.967
GET THAT FINDING OUT A LITTLE

00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:39.069
MORE QUICKLY- BUT THERE WERE

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:40.504
SOME FRIENDS THAT WENT TO

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:42.273
RELATIVELY NEW PROGRAMS FOR

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:43.474
EXAMPLE THAT HOME GARDENING A

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.142
LOT OF THAT COMMITTEE HARDENING

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:46.811
DOLLARS WERE RELATED TO THE HOME

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:49.513
GARDENING- PROGRAM AND THAT'S

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.714
SOMETHING THAT'S JUST BEING

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.449
LAUNCHED. SO AND THE

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:53.284
ADMINISTRATION HAVE MORE

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.685
INFORMATION BUT MY UNDERSTANDING

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:56.487
IS THAT IT'S TAKING SOME TIME TO

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:57.755
GET THAT PROGRAMS ARE UP AND

00:40:57.822 --> 00:40:59.456
RUNNING AND FIGURE OUT ALL THE

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:01.258
DETAILS AND WORK WITH. DAVE

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:02.493
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO MATCHING

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.294
FUNDS WITH THE FEDERAL

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.395
GOVERNMENT THAT'S I THINK TAKEN

00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:05.963
SOMETIME AS WELL SO AGAIN THEY

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.264
THEY AY BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:08.499
THAT MORE DEPTH BUT I THINK PART

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:09.400
OF IT IS JUST THAT CERTAIN

00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:10.868
PROGRAMS. TAKE A LITTLE BIT

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.469
LONGER TO GET UP AND RUNNING-

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:14.471
AND THEN THEY MAY BE A MORE

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:18.309
ESTABLISHED PROGRAM MAKING. JUST

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:18.909
ANOTHER GRANT CYCLE OF. GREAT

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:20.578
THANK THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:24.715
QUESTIONS MR FONG. I THINK

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:26.317
REPORT FOR THE PRESENTATION- I

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:30.554
GUESS MY- BUT- TO PIGGYBACK OFF

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:31.355
WHAT THE CHAIR SAID IN HIS

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:34.525
OPENING REMARKS HOW WOULD YOU OR

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:36.260
THE L. A. L. OR HOW SHOULD WE AS

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:39.763
A LEGISLATURE AND EVALUATE. THE

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.766
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FUNDING SO

00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:45.903
WHAT IS SUCCESS. BUT WHAT WOULD

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.005
YOU DO AS SUCCESS. I THINK

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:49.473
THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.075
QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S I MEAN

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:52.543
ULTIMATELY I THINK ARE ALL HER

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.412
GOAL IS TO HAVE FOREST THAT ARE

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:58.015
THAT ARE RESILIENT AND HEALTHY

00:41:58.082 --> 00:42:00.251
RIGHT AND THAT ARE LESS PRONE TO

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:01.585
SEVERE AND DESTRUCTIVE

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:04.121
WILDFIRES- SO I THINK THAT'S A

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:04.855
REALLY THAT'S SORT OF THE

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:06.724
ULTIMATE GOAL IT'S- SOMETIMES

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:09.226
HARD TO MEASURE EXACTLY. EXACTLY

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:10.661
THAT BUT I THINK LOOKING AT YOU

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:13.297
KNOW HOW MANY AND HOW MANY

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:14.899
ANSWER WHICH TYPES OF YOUR ARE

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.467
WE MEETING OUR GOALS FOR I

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:18.235
TREATING ACRES AND ARE IN

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:19.870
RETREATING ACRES THAT ARE REALLY

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:22.373
PROTECTING AND COMMUNITIES AND

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:23.507
HAVING ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:24.909
IT'S PROBABLY A MIX OF THINGS

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:26.644
BUT I THINK THOSE ARE ALL I

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.779
THINK THE TYPES OF GOALS THAT-

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:31.148
RESISTING. AND CERTAINLY THE

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:32.483
LEGISLATURE I'LL WANT TO AND

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.618
KEEP AN EYE ON AND I'M I THINK

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.787
THAT THEIR- WITH ITS REPORTING

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:37.755
LANGUAGE THEY'LL BE SOME

00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:38.756
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:40.057
HOPEFULLY WILL HELP THE

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:42.159
LEGISLATURE KEEP TRACK OF. OF

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:43.093
WHAT ACTUALLY IS BEING

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.528
ACCOMPLISHED WITH THIS FUNDING

00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:45.896
AND WHETHER THAT'S HELPING TO

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:47.798
MEET THOSE GOALS SURE SO I GUESS

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:52.036
THAT THEN. THAT THE NEXT

00:42:52.102 --> 00:42:53.070
QUESTION THEN IS. IN IN OVER.

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:56.607
THIS THE FUNDING AND WHAT WAS

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:58.709
WHAT HAS BEEN COMMITTED. DO YOU

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:02.479
HAVE THAT DATA TO OVERLAID WHAT

00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:06.417
PROJECTS WERE DONE AND WHAT THEY

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:07.718
MIGHT OF ACRES THAT WERE TREATED

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:11.522
AND WHETHER THE CERTAIN AREAS OF

00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:14.425
THE STATE HAVE IMPROVED- IN

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:16.293
TERMS OF HEALTHY FORCE. THOUGHT

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.394
THAT I'M LOOKING AT I MEAN I'M

00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:19.096
LOOKING AT THE MAP THAT YOU'VE

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:20.931
GOT THE FIRST ONE WITH ALL THE-

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:22.633
THAT THE LIST OF THE FIRES I

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.768
MEAN. DO WE HAVE A LOOK WE HAVE

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:26.603
A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.707
BEEN FUNDED AND WHERE WHEN WHAT

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:31.976
AREAS THERE THERE ARE. SO WE DO

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.043
HAVE A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:33.811
HAVE BEEN FUNDED OF THE

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:35.646
MINISTRATION WAS KIND ENOUGH TO

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:37.147
PROVIDE AND A LIST OF THE

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:38.415

ON THE BUDGET YEAR FUNDING.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.497
pIT'S A LITTLE HARD IT'S PROBABLY

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:55.065
TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF AN- AN

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:56.533
EFFORT TO REALLY DRILL DOWN AND

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.068
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHERE EACH

PROJECT IS LOCATED. AND FIGURE

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:02.339
OUT I THINK THEN YOU HAVE TO DO

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.941
IS PROBABLY PRETTY COMPLEX AND

00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:06.310
TO FIGURE OUT AND- EXACTLY WHICH

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:08.846

THAT POSSIBLE TO DO AN AWESOME

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:29.366
INITIATION AS WELL BUT A BIT

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:33.337
OVERLAY- THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE

THERE'S ANY CORRELATION IN TERMS

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:46.250
OF WHETHER THEY WERE PROJECTS

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:48.085

IT'S NOT JUST THE EARLY ACTION

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:38.602
PACKAGE. IT'S WHAT HAS BEEN DONE

00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:39.470
. HISTORICALLY AND WHETHER THEY

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.538

00:45:41.605 --> 00:45:42.706
WE DON'T GET WE DON'T HAVE A

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:44.808

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.804
PROGRAM ACTUALLY. HELP TREAT IN

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:43.573
AN EXPEDITED WAY IF THERE IS

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.410
SUCH AN EXPEDITED PROCESS. YES

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:48.545
THAT'S A RELATIVELY NEW PROGRAM

00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:49.946
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:52.649
LAUNCHED AND SO IT'S ONE THAT IT

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:54.384
HASN'T BEEN USED AS AS WE DID AS

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:55.519
WE TRY TO LOOK INTO THIS A

00:50:55.585 --> 00:50:56.553
LITTLE BIT SINCE THE LAST

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.988
HEARING WEARING THEIR THIS ISSUE

00:50:58.054 --> 00:50:59.756
WAS ALSO RAISED I'M STILL

00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:02.459
HAVEN'T BEEN USED- VERY. VERY

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:03.860
WIDESPREAD WAY I THINK IT'S

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:05.395
MAYBE ABOUT FOURTEEN PROJECT OF

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:06.496
OUR CALL CORRECTLY ALTHOUGH I

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.931
HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT MY NOTES TO

00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:08.999
DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT BUT IT'S A

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:11.234
RELATIVELY- RELATIVELY SMALL

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:12.135
NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE

00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:13.370
USED IT AS FAR PROUD BECAUSE IT

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:16.706
IS SO NEW- WE DIDN'T FIND CLEAR

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:18.408
YOU KNOW CLEAR DATA SHOWING THAT

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:20.177
IT HAD AND- I THINK THAT CAN BE

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:21.812
EXPEDITED PROJECTS BEGAN ITS

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:24.147
IT'S VERY EARLY DAYS HERE. AND

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:26.883
SO IT'S UNCLEAR I THINK A LOT OF

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:27.651
ONE ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:30.220
WE TALK TO PEOPLE IS THAT-

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:31.421
THERE'S SOME LEARNING CURVE

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:33.657
ASSOCIATED WITH LEARNING AND HOW

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:35.892
TO USE THE CAL B. T. P. KIND OF

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:38.361
PROCESS AND HOW DID AND HOW DID

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:40.297
YOU- SORT OF NAVIGATED A LITTLE

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:45.836
pMORE WIDELY USED AS WELL AS-

00:51:45.902 --> 00:51:47.037
MORE HELPFUL IN EXPEDITING

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.239
PROJECTS- IN THE COMING YEARS

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:50.540
BUT THEY'RE SORT OF IT'S SORT OF

00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:54.711
TBG ON THAT EXACTLY HOW EXACTLY

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:55.312
HOW HOPEFUL IT WILL BE AT THIS

00:51:55.378 --> 00:51:56.446
POINT. THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:59.649
WE CAN GET INFORMATION FOR A LOT

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:02.085
OF HIS PROJECTS- BASICALLY WHAT

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:03.787
WE CAN GATHER WITH THAT THOSE

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:04.821
PROJECTS GENERALLY WOULDN'T HAVE

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:07.357
USED UP DONE A FULL ER ANYWAY A

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:07.991
LOT OF THOSE WOULD HAVE DONE TO

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:09.793
BE MITIGATED TACK OR SOMETHING

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.295
SOMETHING THAT WAS SIMPLER SO.

00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:14.498
YOU KNOW AGAIN AND CAL BTP MAY

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:15.999
SAVE SOME TIME FOR MORE

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.734
COMPLICATED- KIND OF

00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:18.935
ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS OR LIKE

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:20.170
THE- BERMAN PROCESS MAYBE LESS

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:22.472
SO IF PROJECTS WERE SMALLER AND

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:26.076
ABLE TO USE- A CERTAIN ALREADY

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:28.578
MORE AND STREAMLINED PROCESS SO

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.480
IT PROBABLY DEPENDS ON THE

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:32.749
PROJECT ALSO AGAIN IT'S EARLY

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:34.117
DAYS TO SEE BUT WE DIDN'T SEE

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:42.859
I'M AT THIS POINT A LOT OF A.

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:43.927
LOT OF EVIDENCE ON I'M NOT. AND-

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:45.262

OF THEM FINISHED IN RECORD TIME-

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.438
THIS IS CORRECT PICTURE OF THE

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.474
PROJECT. NOW BEEN DONE BY THE

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.842

OUT WAS ABOUT THREE FEET OF

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:47.063
MUSTARD. I'M ON THE OTHER SIDE

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.232
OF THAT FENCE LINE- ON A

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:50.666
NEIGHBORING PROPERTY THAT HAD

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:53.136
BEEN CLEARED OUT SO THIS- EARLY

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:55.104

THERE'S LOTS OF TOOLS THAT

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:03.772
WEREN'T. BURKE MASTICATION ANY

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.474
PRESCRIBED FIRE THEY OFTEN ALL

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.810
GO TOGETHER- BUT THIS IS A GREAT

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:10.112
EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THESE PROJECTS

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:14.683
WORKING IN V. EIGHT- MORE

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.485
COMPLEX FIRE OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN

THOSE GREEN TREES YOU SEE AND-

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:29.064
ARE. NEED MORE COMPLEX FIRE HIT

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.566
IT WAS CLEARLY BURNING AT HIGH

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.868
SEVERITY UNTIL IT HIT THAT

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.770
FUELED BY A MODIFICATION AREA

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.472
WITHOUT COURSE HAD BEEN BENT.

01:09:36.539 --> 01:09:38.607
AND FIRED GROUNDED OUT AND

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.142
BURNED UNDERNEATH THE TREE

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:41.777
CANOPY THAT'S THE GOAL WE'RE

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.212
GOING FOR IS TO BE ABLE TO

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.481
HOWEVER COURSE STAND OUT. SO

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:46.615
THAT WHEN THE FIRE BURNS THROUGH

A BIRDS UNDERNEATH AND THE

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.352
TREES- AND THE ECOLOGY IS LEFT

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:53.055
STANDING- AS OPPOSED TO THE HIGH

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.523
SEVERITY THAT YOU SEE ON THE

01:09:54.590 --> 01:10:04.767
LEFT. ARE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:06.368
ARE HAVING. THIS THE FIRST TIME

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:08.537
THAT WE NEED TO DIRECTLY- STATE

YEAR TO. NOW CREEK TO PROBE.

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:20.015
MORE EFFICIENT WHILE ANSTIEG

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:23.085
PARKS MISSION WHILE MUCH NEARLY

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:24.587
- OVER FIFTY FIVE- IN RIGHT TIME

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.922
. INCLUDE INCREASED- A FEW

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:29.625
REDUCTION- AROUND THEIR AREAS

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:31.727
AND STATE PARKS- IS LAUNCHING

LOOKS LIKE- BEFORE. IN THERE.

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.509
AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:48.644
THAT ARE INVESTING IN THESE

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:50.813
RESILIENT LANDSCAPES SO FORCED

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:52.881
HEALTH GRANTS FROM CAL FIRE.

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:55.484
DRAMATICALLY SCALED UP- WE HAVE

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:56.986
PROGRAMS FOR SMALL FOREST

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:13.736
FOLKS THAT HAVE FIFTY ACRES ONE

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:15.204
HUNDRED ACRES A THOUSAND ACRES-

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.539
SO THE SMALLER PLOTS. AND THESE

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:18.974
GRANTS HELP THEM TREAT THEIR

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.576

AREAS I MENTIONED SO. I JUST

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:25.787
WENT THROUGH THOSE PROGRAMS THAT

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:27.022
ARE THOSE THREE FUNDS HAVE

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:28.824
DIRECTIONS BILLIONS WHERE WE'RE

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.025
WE'RE LOWERING THE FUEL

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:30.926
INTENSITY AND THAT FIRE

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:32.261
INTENSITY ON THE LANDSCAPE

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:34.329
RETURNING THOSE NATURAL FIRE

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:35.931

TACTICAL ADVANTAGES AND

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:43.105
COMMUNITIES HAVE SAFE ESCAPE

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:45.540
ROUTES DURING WILDFIRES AND THEN

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:47.476
INVESTING INSIDE OF COMMUNITIES

TO MAKE HOMES LESS IGNITION

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:50.913
PROBLEM WHEN THOSE BIG NUMBERS

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:52.814
ARE COMING IN. ON SO THE LAST

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.317
AREAS ARE REGIONAL INVESTMENTS

DON'T HAVE SOME BREACH- AND-

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:00.549
WHICH ARE OFTEN ASKED OF THE

PARTNERSHIPS THAT MAKE THESE

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.525
INVESTMENTS I'LL GIVE YOU A

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:11.793
COUPLE EXAMPLES SO THAT THIS

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.129
ISN'T QUITE SO ABSTRACT SO EARLY

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:15.864
ACTION DOLLARS WE'RE REALLY

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:18.266
IMPACTFUL WHERE THEY INVESTED.

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:19.868
IN A REGIONAL COLLABORATIVES

01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:21.870
THAT ALREADY BEEN SET UP UNDER

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:23.338
THIS REGIONAL FORCING FIRE

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:25.574
CAPACITY PROGRAM SO THIS IS AN

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.708
EXAMPLE FROM THE SANTA MONICA

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:28.610
MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY- WHERE

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:30.545
THEY HAD BEEN INVESTING IN A

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.481
REGIONAL STRATEGY IN THEIR AREA

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:33.982
AND SO WHEN THEY GOT EARLY

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:36.351
ACTION DOLLARS IT COMPLEMENTED

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:38.020
CALIFORNIA FORCED HEALTH GRANTS-

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:40.255

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:54.536
PROTECTION PROGRAM WHICH THEY

01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:55.670
HAVE DEPLOYED AS EARLY AS FOURTH

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:58.306
OF JULY. I'M AND WE'RE IN TO

01:17:58.373 --> 01:18:02.778
STOP. SIMILARLY FIRE- AND- THEY

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.046
WERE ABLE TO ALSO THAT READ

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:05.313
INVESTMENT ACROSS THESE LANDS

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.883
SCALE. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE FAR

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.652
LEFT GEORGINA'S LOADING. AND

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:13.055
HELP- RESTORATION. I'M ANOTHER

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:14.823
GREAT EXAMPLE IS THE SAN DIEGO

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:17.192
CONSERVANCY INVESTED IN A

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:18.560
PARTNERSHIP THAT ALREADY BEEN

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:20.295
ESTABLISHED WHEN HE ASKED SAN

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.797
DIEGO RESOURCE CONSERVATION

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:24.499
DISTRICT. SCHERING YOUR MAP. OF

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:25.934
THE SAN DIEGO AREA WITH ALL OF

THE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS

01:18:27.702 --> 01:18:28.804
THAT'S WHY HE'S REGIONAL

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.672
INVESTMENTS ARE SO CRITICAL

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:32.641
BECAUSE IF WE ALLOW IT TO EACH

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:35.277
JURISDICTION OPERATE IN A SILO.

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:36.912
THAT PATCHWORK AND WOULD BE

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:39.014
DETRIMENTAL TO A FIRE WOULD JUST

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:41.149
BIRD STREET UNIT PATCHWORK ON BY

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.952
A COHESIVE APPROACH ANCHORED BY

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:45.087
THE SAN DIEGO RESOURCE

01:18:45.153 --> 01:18:46.888
CONSERVATION DISTRICT. AND

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:53.562
PARTNERED. WITH THE SAN DIEGO

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:55.097
CONSERVANCY. YEAH FUNDING

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:57.899
PROMISED FORCES PASS PRO. TO

BE A TO SEE UP THAT REGIONAL

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:06.108
STRATEGY AS WELL. SO THAT WE ARE

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:09.044
ACTION DOLLAR TEEN IN THE SAN CA

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:10.846
. AND CALIFORNIA FORCED GRANTS

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:12.681
WERE IN TO BOTH COME IN AND

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:15.851
MAKING THE- IN LAST. IS REALLY

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:19.521
TRIED ARE ALSO REALLY CREWS. TO

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.858
OUR SPECIAL PARTNERSHIP WE ARE

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:25.594
USING THESE AS A JOB GREEN ARROW

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:30.699
THAT SAYS GOVERNMENT INVEST.

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:33.201
HERE YOU SEEN SAN DIEGO THE FOR

WORKING. IN ACROSS THE- REGARD

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:43.445
OF WHEN. TYPE AND SO AND WE ARE

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:44.546
SEEING THIS REPEATED THROUGHOUT

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.081
THE STATE AND OUR EXPANDED

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:47.782
INVESTMENTS IN THE REGIONAL

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:49.885
FORCING FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAMS

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.219
ARE REALLY ANCHORING THOSE

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:54.623
INVESTMENTS SO THAT WE WILL SEE

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:56.458
THIS AS- THE NORM- I ALSO WANT

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.126
TO TAKE A MINUTE AND THIS'LL BE

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:00.695
STUDENT. LAST FIVE MINUTES HERE-

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:03.064
TO TALK THROUGH THE OTHER AREAS

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.933
THAT WE'RE DRIVING ECONOMY AND

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.968
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT HERE SO

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.670
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:09.971
WITH THESE PEOPLE ARE ACTION

01:20:10.038 --> 01:20:11.573

THE DEATH YOU ALL. ON THIS IS

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.376
ALSO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'RE

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:16.278
HAVING IN THAT MOST OF OUR MEALS

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:17.479

IS- THAT THEY THEY'RE DOING POST

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:24.719
FIRE SALVAGE SO THERE IS A LOT

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:28.757
OF DEAD WOULD DROP CALIFORNIA

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:29.691

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:39.034
AS A SENSE OF SCALE. THIS IS ONE

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.102
OF MANY SLASH PILES ON THE IN

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:44.873
AND AROUND THIS YEAR REGION- AND

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.808

TO GET.ENTIRE AND CHIU. DURING

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:51.079
SOME OF THESE BIG FIRES ENSURE

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:53.348
THAT THESE DIDN'T BECOME- HUGE.

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:56.218
THEMSELVES AND SO CREATING. FOR

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:58.753
THAT WOODY BIOMASS CREW. AND

WE'RE TALKING AGNOSTIC BECAUSE

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:02.390
IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF

TIMBER- THE BIO. FUEL ARE

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:18.807
PROJECTS THAT WILL CONVERT THOSE

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:21.543
WOODY BIOMASS PILES INTO- ON THE

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.745

SAVE NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:12.507

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:14.342
GRANDFATHER ENTERED THE BILTMORE

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:17.779

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:20.114
EIGHTY NINE. EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN.

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:22.049
IF YOU CAME TO CALIFORNIA AS THE

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:24.619
FIRST. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:27.488
FORRESTER. IN THE NIGHT IN THE

SEVERAL YEARS TRANSPLANTS WERE

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.830
IN BACK BETWEEN COAST TO COAST

01:30:35.897 --> 01:30:39.634
WASHINGTON DC. CALIFORNIA AND

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:44.038
HIS HIS ASSIGNMENT WAS TO SURVEY

OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. MINING

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:10.932

AND DOING IT TAKING EVERYTHING

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.514
THAT WAS CLOSEST AND EASIEST TO

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:31.819
GRAB. THEN WE ALSO HAD HUMAN

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:36.490
CAUSED FIRES INCREASE. WE HAD

01:31:36.557 --> 01:31:38.092

SPANISH. A CENTURY OF FIRE

01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:03.517

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:47.815
SCENARIO WE HAVE TO THINK OF

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:50.484
THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. IT IS

01:34:50.551 --> 01:34:51.719
ABOUT STATE PROTECTING THE

THAT IN WAYS THAT MY GREAT

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.531
GRANDFATHER NEVER COULD HAVE. WE

01:35:03.597 --> 01:35:05.599
HAVE THE SCIENCE. AND THE

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:07.868
BACKING OF GOOD MANAGEMENT

01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:10.104
PRACTICES AND THE ABILITY TO

01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:12.006
ADJUST OUR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:15.576
OVER TIME. AND USE THE TASK

01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:18.312
FORCEWORK AND THE NINETY NINE

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:20.314
TASKS THAT ARE THERE AND IT

FORESTERS. I HAVE BEEN IN

01:36:07.661 --> 01:36:09.130

WITHOUT TRAVEL. AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:20.708
MEETING AND TALKING. AND IT IS

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:23.010
ABSOLUTELY STRIKING. THAT

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:26.280
NATIONWIDE. STATE FORESTERS ARE

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:29.550
SEEING VIRTUALLY THE SAME ISSUES

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:34.588
ACROSS THE BOARD. NOT ONLY ARE

01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:36.790
WE SEEING THE SAME ISSUES. WE'RE

01:36:36.857 --> 01:36:40.594
HAVING THE SAME INTEREST AND

01:36:40.661 --> 01:36:41.996
EXCITEMENT ABOUT WHERE THE

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:43.531
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY

01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:46.133
GOING TO INVEST. IN THEIR LACK

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.701
OF MANAGEMENT OVER THE LAST

01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:50.638
SEVERAL YEARS. ABOUT THEY

01:36:50.704 --> 01:36:52.573
STARTED WITH STRONG MANAGEMENT

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.607
THERE'S BEEN SOME THINGS THAT

01:36:53.674 --> 01:36:55.309
ARE SLOW THINGS DOWN WE NEED TO

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:57.611
GET BACK ON TRACK I SEE IT THE

01:36:57.678 --> 01:36:58.679
INVESTMENT FROM THE FEDERAL

01:36:58.746 --> 01:37:00.581
GOVERNMENT ASK. WORKING TO GET

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:03.284
BACK ON TRACK. IT'S NOT UNLIKE

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:05.653
WE'VE BEEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:06.220
THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE YEARS

01:37:06.287 --> 01:37:10.658
BEHIND. SO I EXPECT THAT THIS

01:37:10.724 --> 01:37:12.960
INVESTMENT NATIONWIDE. AND

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:14.795
THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS GOING TO

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:16.197
BE SOMETHING THAT REALLY

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:20.501
ELEVATES. THE PRACTICE OF

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:22.570
FORESTRY AND FOREST MANAGEMENT A

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:25.506
NATIONWIDE THIS IS A TIME THAT

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:27.775
FORESTRY IS IN A REVIVAL MODE

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:29.276
THAT I COULDN'T EVEN HAVE

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:31.979
IMAGINED WHEN I STARTED INTO THE

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:34.014
PRACTICE OF FORCED WE ARE AT A

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:35.216
POINT IN TIME WHERE WE ARE

01:37:35.282 --> 01:37:39.453
SEEING A TIDAL SHIFT. THAT IS

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.022
MUCH LIKE THE BEGINNING. AT

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:43.724
EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE. NIGHTS

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.926
EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS PERIOD

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:48.796
AND WE HAVE TO. HAVE TO SEIZE

01:37:48.862 --> 01:37:50.698
THAT MOMENT WE NEED TO PUSH

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:52.700
FORWARD WE NEED TO MAKE THE

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.268
INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:55.603
UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:58.339
ADAPT AND GET BETTER OVER TIME

01:37:58.405 --> 01:38:01.742
SO PERFECT IS NOT THAT STRONG

01:38:01.809 --> 01:38:02.343
WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR IN THE

01:38:02.409 --> 01:38:05.746
FIRST GO. WE ARE STRIVING TO GET

01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:07.548

01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:54.080
THE STATE HAVE EXPERIENCED. HIGH

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:57.117
MORTALITY- OR WHAT WE WOULD

01:50:57.183 --> 01:50:59.953
CONSIDER HIGH SEVERITY WILDFIRE

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.888
OR MODERATE SEVERITY WILDFIRE.

01:51:01.955 --> 01:51:03.189
AND AT THIS POINT- THE

01:51:03.256 --> 01:51:04.858
PARTNERSHIP THAT THAT THAT'S

01:51:04.924 --> 01:51:06.393
WELL REPRESENTED MOTION SIR I

01:51:06.459 --> 01:51:07.594
WELL I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE

01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:09.162
PARTNERSHIP IS WELL KNOWN THAT

01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:10.997
WE NEED A AND GOT. A ROBUST

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:12.999
INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER

01:51:13.066 --> 01:51:15.035
TO MEET OUR GOALS OF TREATING

01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:15.668
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ON

01:51:15.735 --> 01:51:17.370
STATE PROPERTY OR STATE STATE

01:51:17.437 --> 01:51:18.938
AND PRIVATE LANDS AS WELL AS

01:51:19.005 --> 01:51:20.073
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ON.

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.908
FEDERAL LANDS BUT WE ALREADY

01:51:21.975 --> 01:51:24.778
TRUE TRIAGE STATE. THE NUMBER OF

01:51:24.844 --> 01:51:25.879
DEAD TREES OF WHICH THIS

01:51:25.945 --> 01:51:27.547
INDUSTRY IS TRYING TO METABOLIZE

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:29.549
ON IT'S ONLY AND I WAS STANDING

01:51:29.616 --> 01:51:32.752
OUTSIDE ON. PRIVATE AREN'T

01:51:32.819 --> 01:51:34.788
EITHER A PRIVATE OR- PUBLIC

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:37.957
LANDS- IS THE TREE IS THE MAIN

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:40.493
GOAL OF OUR ASSOCIATION AT THIS

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.595
AND MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION.

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:44.564
FOR INSTANCE IN THE DIXIE FIRE

01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:46.833
ALONE. UP ON PRIVATE LANDS

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.568
NEARLY ONE POINT SIX BILLION

01:51:48.635 --> 01:51:50.637
BOARD FEET HAS BIRD THAT IS ON

01:51:50.703 --> 01:51:52.138
THE PRIVATE LANDS ONLY THAT IS

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:53.106
NOT WITHSTANDING ANY PUBLIC

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:55.942
PLANS. ARE STATE PROCESSES ABOUT

01:51:56.009 --> 01:51:57.243
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION BOARD

01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:59.412
FEET IN A GIVEN YEAR. THE POINT

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.714
BEING THAT THAT ONE

01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:04.084
CONFLAGRATION HAS RESULTED IN

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:06.820
MORTALITY OF MORE BOARD FEET ONE

01:52:06.886 --> 01:52:08.354
FELL SWOOP AND WE ARE ABLE TO

01:52:08.421 --> 01:52:10.457
PROCESS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE.

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:12.058
IN A ONE THANK AND THAT AND THAT

01:52:12.125 --> 01:52:13.493
BEEN THE PERIMETER OF THE DIXIE

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.662
FIRE. IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE

01:52:15.728 --> 01:52:16.830
TO CLEAN IT UP AND IT'S

01:52:16.896 --> 01:52:19.299
IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCESS IT AT THIS

01:52:19.365 --> 01:52:21.401
PARTICULAR POINT. AND AGAIN WITH

01:52:21.468 --> 01:52:23.536
THE WITH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:24.737
THE DESIRE FOR THE PARTNERSHIP

01:52:24.804 --> 01:52:25.738
WITH THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO

01:52:25.805 --> 01:52:27.540
MEET OTHER GOALS WE HAVE SET

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:33.480
FORTH- IT'S GOING TO BE VERY

01:52:33.546 --> 01:52:35.715
CHALLENGING. SO WE A LOT ABOUT

01:52:35.782 --> 01:52:37.984
THE POINT FOR BILLION. FOUR

01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:39.352
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:41.488
THE BUDGET AND I WILL SAY.

01:52:41.554 --> 01:52:43.389
WITHOUT HESITATION CALIFORNIA

01:52:43.456 --> 01:52:45.024
SUPPORTS THAT ALLOCATION OF

01:52:45.091 --> 01:52:47.794
FUNDING- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:48.661
THAT WOULD BE THE BASELINE

01:52:48.728 --> 01:52:50.396
FUNDING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:52.799
INTO THE FUTURE TO TRY TO COMBAT

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:54.400
THE ISSUES OR THE CRISIS THAT

01:52:54.467 --> 01:52:57.137
WE'RE FACING- WE SPENT A LOT OF

01:52:57.203 --> 01:52:58.371
TIME TALKING ABOUT FIRE

01:52:58.438 --> 01:52:59.506
PREVENTION IN THE SPACE OF

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:01.908
FORESTRY- WE KNEW THE FIRE

01:53:01.975 --> 01:53:03.943
PREVENTION FOR DECADES AND FUND

01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:05.445
IT WOULD NEED TO BE FUNDED AND

01:53:05.512 --> 01:53:07.614
EXECUTED- BUT WE'VE NOW GOTTEN

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.382
TO THE POINT WHERE POST FIRE

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:10.083
RECOVERY IS GOING TO HAVE TO

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:11.718
PLAY A POINT. ARE IS GONNA HAVE

01:53:11.784 --> 01:53:13.987
TO PLAY A ROLE IN FUTURE

01:53:14.053 --> 01:53:14.754
ALLOCATIONS AS RELATES TO THE

01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:16.923
BUDGET. AND BEYOND THAT WE NEED

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:17.891
TO START LOOKING AT ALL THE

01:53:17.957 --> 01:53:19.325
TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX I WOULD

01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:21.161
ALSO SUGGEST POST FIRE RECOVERY

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:23.329
COUPLED WITH BIOMASS. BIOMASS

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:24.430
INDUSTRY TO GET IT UP AND

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:26.166
RUNNING AS A BRIDGE AS WE LOOK

01:53:26.232 --> 01:53:27.567
INTO INVESTMENTS INTO FUTURE

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:28.601
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL COME TO

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:30.436
SCALE. WE HAVE SEVERAL IDOL

01:53:30.503 --> 01:53:31.771
BIOGAS PLANTS OF THE STATE

01:53:31.838 --> 01:53:34.040
CURRENTLY AND EVEN WITH ALL

01:53:34.107 --> 01:53:35.208
BIOMASS FACILITIES UP AND

01:53:35.275 --> 01:53:37.177
RUNNING ARE WE STILL DON'T HAVE

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:38.411
THE CAPACITY TO GET WHERE WE

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:39.979
NEED TO BE BUT TO HAVE I DON'T

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:44.984
BOMBYCILLIDAE ASSUMES- SHORT

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:45.618
SIGHTED. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT- WE

01:53:45.685 --> 01:53:48.221
DO WORKFORCE- JUST GOT MORE SAID

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:50.657
TOUCHED ON IT- WE NEED FOR

01:53:50.723 --> 01:53:52.292
FUTURE INVESTMENTS AND WORKFORCE

01:53:52.358 --> 01:53:53.560
DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE BREAKS WE

01:53:53.626 --> 01:53:54.961
HAVE A GREAT OUR PROGRAM IS

01:53:55.028 --> 01:53:57.063
SHASTA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I SAY

01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:59.599
REPLICATION OF THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:01.467
PROGRAMS TO OTHER. INSTITUTIONS

01:54:01.534 --> 01:54:03.203
OF THE J. C. STATUS SYSTEM

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:05.471
SPREADING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA

01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:07.407
WOULD BE A SOLID STEP FORWARD.

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:08.741
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:54:08.808 --> 01:54:10.743
THAT IN TODAY'S WORLD WE OPERATE

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:11.945
IN CALIFORNIA UNDER FIRE

01:54:12.011 --> 01:54:14.113
PROTECTION SYSTEM AND I KNOW

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:14.714
THAT WE'RE TALKING TODAY ABOUT

01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:17.016
FIRE PREVENTION. BUT WE CANNOT

01:54:17.083 --> 01:54:18.618
DECOUPLE THE DISCUSSION OF

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:21.321
SUPPRESSION AS WELL- WE NEED TO

01:54:21.387 --> 01:54:23.022
HAVE A ROBUST SUPPRESSION FORCE

01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:24.390
I THINK IT'S PRETTY WELL

01:54:24.457 --> 01:54:26.226
UNDERSTOOD THE CALIFORNIA SHORT

01:54:26.292 --> 01:54:27.727
SEVERAL HAND CREWS THIS YEAR TO

01:54:27.794 --> 01:54:29.429
THE TO THE PROBABLY SEVENTY TO

01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:31.397
EIGHTY AND CREWS. THAT SAME

01:54:31.464 --> 01:54:32.932
PATTERNS EXIST WITHIN OUR

01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:34.067
FEDERAL PARTNERS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:54:34.133 --> 01:54:35.835
AS WELL AND I THINK THAT WE NEED

01:54:35.902 --> 01:54:37.570
TO LOOK AT BACKFILLING THAT

01:54:37.637 --> 01:54:40.240
THAT. AIM TO SHORTAGE SO THAT WE

01:54:40.306 --> 01:54:42.041
CAN GET ON THESE FIRES AND GET

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:44.043
THEM OUT SOONER RATHER THAN

01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:45.979
LATER DURING FIRE SEASON. AGAIN

01:54:46.045 --> 01:54:47.814
WE'VE INVESTED ONE POINT FIVE

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.816
BILLION IN THE PREVENTION AND IF

01:54:49.882 --> 01:54:51.618
WE HAVE A ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF

01:54:51.684 --> 01:54:53.019
FORCE THAT'S ABLE TO GET THESE

01:54:53.086 --> 01:54:54.787
FIRES OUT EARLY THAT MEANS OF

01:54:54.854 --> 01:54:56.422
ACRES WILL BE RETAINED AND THAT

01:54:56.489 --> 01:54:57.824
WE CAN ACTUALLY INVEST THE MONEY

01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:59.325
AND THAT WE'RE INTENDED TO

01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:00.560
INVEST IN FIRE PREVENTION.

01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:04.197
BURNING. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:05.331
OF ACRES A YEAR. I HIGH INTENSE

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:07.700
. IS TAKING FOR BURKE. OF AND WE

01:55:07.767 --> 01:55:10.036
NEED TO BE. PUTTING THESE FIRES

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:11.671
OUT EARLY DURING FIRE SEASON SO

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:13.172
THAT WE CAN INVEST IMPROPERLY AS

01:55:13.239 --> 01:55:15.241
IT RELATES TO- FIRE PREVENTION

01:55:15.308 --> 01:55:17.043
ACTIVITIES. I'VE ALSO HEARD A

01:55:17.110 --> 01:55:18.745
LOT ABOUT VINCE VERSUS SUCCESS

01:55:18.811 --> 01:55:20.747
TODAY. AND AGAIN I WANT TO BE

01:55:20.813 --> 01:55:23.082
VERY CLEAR CALIFORNIA IS A VERY

01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:25.184
SUPPORTIVE OF THE INVESTMENTS

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:26.786
MADE IN THE SPACE OF FIRE

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:28.187
PREVENTION AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:30.523
SUPPORT THAT. BUT THE BENCHMARKS

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:33.726
OF SUCCESS I BELIEVE COULD BE.

01:55:33.793 --> 01:55:35.728
ARE FOCUSED ON LAST HIGH

01:55:35.795 --> 01:55:38.698
SEVERITY ACRES ACROSS THE STATE.

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:39.999
AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:55:40.066 --> 01:55:41.334
INNOVATIVE WAYS TO MAKE THAT

01:55:41.401 --> 01:55:43.636
HAPPEN AS SOON WE ARE IN AN

01:55:43.703 --> 01:55:45.471
EXISTENTIAL CRISIS DOWNSTREAM

01:55:45.538 --> 01:55:47.507
WATERS. THE LONGS OF THE FOLKS

01:55:47.573 --> 01:55:48.775
IN THE BAY AREA AS WELL

01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:51.477
SACRAMENTO AND LA BASED SAID. I

01:55:51.544 --> 01:55:53.279
MEAN THIS WITH WILDFIRES BUT A

01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:55.381
PART OF FORESTRY FOR A VERY VERY

01:55:55.448 --> 01:55:57.283
LONG TIME. HISTORICALLY WE'VE

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:58.551
BEEN ABLE TO METABOLIZE THAT WE

01:55:58.618 --> 01:56:00.119
ARE AT A CRISIS THAT HAS GONE

01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:01.187
BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:02.822
FOREST PRODUCTS SECTOR OR THE

01:56:02.889 --> 01:56:04.023
NATIONAL FOREST AND IS NOW

01:56:04.090 --> 01:56:11.264
AFFECTING EVERYBODY IN THE STATE. AND TAKING ACTION TO TRY TO

01:56:11.331 --> 01:56:13.800
CHANGE. ASPECTS OF OUR SYSTEM

01:56:13.866 --> 01:56:15.435
BEFORE THE ONSET OF THIS THAT'S

01:56:15.501 --> 01:56:16.669
FIRE SEASON WHICH I REMIND

01:56:16.736 --> 01:56:18.137
EVERYBODY IS REALLY ONLY MONTHS

01:56:18.204 --> 01:56:21.007
AWAY. SO THAT WOULD CONCLUDE MY

01:56:21.074 --> 01:56:22.508
REMARKS AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:56:22.575 --> 01:56:24.510

ACRES. A LITTLE BIT ON BIOMASS

01:57:33.679 --> 01:57:35.515
LITTLE BIT ON FEDERAL LANDS. SO

01:57:35.581 --> 01:57:38.017
IN CALIFORNIA IF WE ARE GOING TO

01:57:38.084 --> 01:57:39.852
THIN OUT OF FOREST- TO REDUCE

01:57:39.919 --> 01:57:40.853
FEELS AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.988
COMMERCIALIZE SOME OF THOSE

01:57:42.054 --> 01:57:44.357
TREES WE HAVE A THREE. PERMIT

01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:46.659
PROCESS HAT IS DUPLICATIVE- WE

01:57:46.726 --> 01:57:48.394
HAVE TO APPLY FOR THE TIMBER

01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:50.129
HARVEST PLAN WITH CAL FIRE WE

01:57:50.196 --> 01:57:52.398
HAVE TO GET. A DEEPER DUPLICATE

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:54.300
A PERMIT FROM THE WATER BOARDS.

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:57.537
AND ALSO FROM DEPARTMENT OF FISH

01:57:57.603 --> 01:57:59.472
AND WILDLIFE. AND THERE'S BEEN

01:57:59.539 --> 01:58:01.974
AND NUMBER OF EFFORTS- NONE OF

01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:03.943
WHICH I HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:05.077
STREAMLINING THAT PERMIT

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:06.212
COMBINING ALL THREE OF THOSE

01:58:06.279 --> 01:58:08.981
PERMITS INTO ONE NOT HAVING

01:58:09.048 --> 01:58:09.615
THREE STATE AGENCIES DO THE SAME

01:58:09.682 --> 01:58:11.484
THING. SO I'M GLAD TO SEE IN THE

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:13.019
BUDGET THAT THERE'S FOUR MILLION

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:15.688
DOLLARS TO. STREAMLINE THE

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:17.523
PROCESS FOR PERMIT EFFICIENCY-

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:19.225
BUT WE'VE HAD A BAD TRACK RECORD

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:20.092
OF TRYING TO GET THEIR THERE'S

01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:23.162
BEEN. FIVE PASSED DIRECTIVES. TO

01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:24.597
STREAMLINE THE PERMIT PROCESS

01:58:24.664 --> 01:58:27.867
THE FIRST ONE WAS. EIGHTY

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:28.501
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AUTHORED BY

01:58:28.568 --> 01:58:30.269
THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE.

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:32.171
THAT REQUIRED AGENCIES TO

01:58:32.238 --> 01:58:33.239
IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT

01:58:33.306 --> 01:58:35.007
EFFICIENCIES IN THE REGULATION

01:58:35.074 --> 01:58:36.542
OF TIMBER HARVESTING BUT WE

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:38.277
HAVEN'T SEEN. LIKE I SAID ANY

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:40.446
IMPROVEMENTS ON THAT. FOUR OTHER

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:42.548
ONES BROWN A FORMER GOVERNOR

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:44.917
BROWN HAD AN EXECUTIVE ORDER-

01:58:44.984 --> 01:58:47.920
THAT. MANDATED VARIOUS AGENCIES

01:58:47.987 --> 01:58:48.721
TO SYNCHRONIZE AND EXPEDITE THE

01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:51.424

THAT'S RESOURCE IS AGENCY TO

01:58:54.861 --> 01:58:56.662
IMPLEMENT ACTIONS TO INCREASE

01:58:56.729 --> 01:58:59.565
THE PACE AND SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:58:59.632 --> 01:59:02.668
REST- RESTORATION- IN IN THE-

01:59:02.735 --> 01:59:04.237
WILD FIRE FOREST RESILIENCY

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:06.239
ACTION PLAN AND THAT CAME OUT IN

01:59:06.305 --> 01:59:08.641
JANUARY HAD A- KEY ACTION THAT-

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:10.476
STATED THAT. THE PERMIT

WELL THAT WAS JUST APPROVED. SO

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:23.256
GIVEN THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:25.224
ANYWHERE ON THIS- THE COMMITTEE

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:26.559

01:59:26.626 --> 01:59:28.761
OF REPORTING MECHANISM. TO MAKE

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:29.929
SURE THAT WOULD REDUCE SPEND

01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:31.364
THOSE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:33.499
PERMANENT SYNCHRONIZATION THAT

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:35.301
IT GETS DONE THIS TIME. AND

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:37.069
ACCOUNTABILITY ON GETTING TO

01:59:37.136 --> 01:59:40.973
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES-

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.275
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PHONE YOU HAD

01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:43.709

HEARING THAT- WE'RE HAVING A

01:59:46.445 --> 01:59:48.314
HARD TIME GETTING TO HOW MANY

01:59:48.381 --> 01:59:49.282
ACRES AND HOW MANY PROJECTS HAVE

01:59:49.348 --> 01:59:51.517
BEEN DONE AND SO WE NEED A POINT

01:59:51.584 --> 01:59:53.886
PERSON TO BE IN CHARGE OF ALL

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:54.921
THE VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:59:54.987 --> 01:59:56.556
GOING ON BY VARIOUS AGENCIES

01:59:56.622 --> 01:59:58.057
CONSERVANCY IS FIRE SAFE

01:59:58.124 --> 02:00:01.193
COUNCILS AND HAVE THAT PERSON

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:03.763
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING

02:00:03.829 --> 02:00:05.932
GETTING TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:00:05.998 --> 02:00:07.600
ACRES PRIORITIZING PROJECTS

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:08.467
MAKING SURE THEY'RE GOING IN

02:00:08.534 --> 02:00:10.169
AREAS AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS-

02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:13.839
PATCHWORK OF. PROJECTS GOING ON

02:00:13.906 --> 02:00:15.107
- WE'VE GOT THIRTY THREE MILLION

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:18.177
ACRES OF FORESTS IF WE CAN'T GET

02:00:18.244 --> 02:00:18.811
TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A

02:00:18.878 --> 02:00:20.112
YEAR. THAT'S HARD TO SEE WE'RE

02:00:20.179 --> 02:00:21.447
GOING TO MAKE ANY DENT IN THIS

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:22.949
ISSUE SO WE NEED A LARGE

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:25.418
LANDSCAPING. PROJECTS THAT HAVE

02:00:25.484 --> 02:00:28.321
BEEN DISCUSSED- NEED TO HAPPEN

02:00:28.387 --> 02:00:30.089
NOW AND IT'S BEEN A EXPEDITED

02:00:30.156 --> 02:00:32.358
MANNER- WE'VE HEARD ABOUT

02:00:32.425 --> 02:00:34.660
BIOMASS TODAY. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:36.562
GONNA HAVE A TON OF IT MILLIONS

02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:40.566
OF TONS OF BIOMASS- MOST THE

02:00:40.633 --> 02:00:41.701
TIME THIS IS BURNED OUT IN THE

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:42.969
WOODS AND THAT DOESN'T HELP OUR

02:00:43.035 --> 02:00:45.037
MISSION'S GOALS HERE IN THE

02:00:45.104 --> 02:00:47.807
STATE- AND SO WE NEED TO GET THE

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:49.976
THAT INTO A BIOMASS FACILITY.

02:00:50.042 --> 02:00:52.144
AND BY OUR ESTIMATE WE NEED

02:00:52.211 --> 02:00:53.412
ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION

02:00:53.479 --> 02:00:54.747
DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO GET THAT

02:00:54.814 --> 02:00:59.385
MATERIAL TO A BIOMASS FACILITY-

02:00:59.452 --> 02:01:00.953
SO THAT'S- CONSIDERING THE COST

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:02.355
OF WILDFIRE THAT'S CHEAP

02:01:02.421 --> 02:01:05.791
INSURANCE. AND THEN- FEDERAL

02:01:05.858 --> 02:01:08.060
FOREST LANDS- CHIEF PORTER

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:09.829
TOUCHED ON REFORESTATION AND YES

02:01:09.895 --> 02:01:11.764
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE JUST

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:14.900
IN BETWEEN- TWO THOUSAND AND TWO

02:01:14.967 --> 02:01:16.369
THOUSAND FIFTEEN- FOR SERVICE

02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:18.404
LAS SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY

02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:19.372
THOUSAND ACRES OF FOREST THAT

02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:21.207
BURNED TO A DEFORESTED CONDITION

02:01:21.273 --> 02:01:22.975
AND ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT.

02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:25.511
WERE REPLANTED AND OF COURSE

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:27.747
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

02:01:27.813 --> 02:01:29.181
THAT'S- MORE OF A SIGNIFICANT

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:32.251
NUMBER SO- IT WOULD BE VERY

02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:33.653
BENEFICIAL FOR THE STATE TO COME

02:01:33.719 --> 02:01:34.754
UP WITH SOME KIND OF MATCH

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.689

WITH FIRE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- I

02:02:38.284 --> 02:02:39.552

THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCES JUST

02:03:03.976 --> 02:03:05.644
FINALIZING BUT I CAN HONESTLY

02:03:05.711 --> 02:03:07.179

02:05:40.032 --> 02:05:41.066
FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE WORK IN

02:05:50.342 --> 02:05:51.777
THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE

02:05:51.844 --> 02:05:53.846

CALIFORNIA. A PART OF THE

02:18:21.092 --> 02:18:22.060
PROBLEM IS WE'VE BEEN MANAGING

02:18:22.127 --> 02:18:24.129
THEM ACCORDING TO THE PHILOSOPHY

02:18:24.195 --> 02:18:26.231

02:18:30.568 --> 02:18:32.971
POINT I MEAN AGAIN URGENCY I

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:36.408
THINK IS THE ISSUE WE GOT MONEY

02:18:36.474 --> 02:18:38.176

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:40.178

02:18:58.863 --> 02:19:01.900
HOW WE MANAGE OUR FORESTS- AND

02:19:01.966 --> 02:19:04.269
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO MAKE UP FOR

02:19:04.335 --> 02:19:08.740
RIGHT SO- LAST YEAR. IT CAME OUT

02:19:08.807 --> 02:19:10.241

UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE

02:21:35.887 --> 02:21:37.589
BETWEEN TREATED I THINK WE'VE

02:21:37.655 --> 02:21:39.490
BECOME REALLY FAMILIAR WITH

02:21:39.557 --> 02:21:41.726
WHAT'S TREATED AND WHAT'S

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:43.094
PROTECTED- BUT THAT'S ANOTHER

02:21:43.161 --> 02:21:44.162
PART OF THIS WE NEED REAL

02:21:44.229 --> 02:21:45.730
TRANSPARENCY ON. YOU KNOW WHAT

02:21:45.797 --> 02:21:47.432
ARE THOSE THINGS WHAT ARE THE

02:21:47.498 --> 02:21:50.001
DIFFERENCES AND TREATMENTS. AND

02:21:50.068 --> 02:21:50.602
WHAT IS ACTUALLY PROTECTED AT

02:21:50.668 --> 02:21:56.841
THE END OF THE DAY. RIGHT AND-

02:21:56.908 --> 02:21:59.611
WHAT JESSICA ELUDED TO WITHOUT

02:21:59.677 --> 02:22:02.313

02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:04.249
STATE FORESTER AND FIRE CHIEF

02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:07.185
HEALTHCARE. BUT IS THAT THAT

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:10.588
THOSE ACRES WILL BE RECORDED AS

02:22:10.655 --> 02:22:13.992
THEY COME IN- THAT IS THE WAY

02:22:14.058 --> 02:22:16.828
THE PROCESS WORKS. I GET YOU

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:18.263
WITH THE ESTIMATE BUT THE

02:22:18.329 --> 02:22:22.901
ESTIMATE- I DON'T HOW. AND WE

02:22:22.967 --> 02:22:25.603

02:22:29.107 --> 02:22:31.576
THOSE PROJECTS. WELL THAT'S WHAT

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:33.544
WE HAVE AT THIS POINT. OKAY SO

02:22:33.611 --> 02:22:36.814
WE DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE AT

02:22:36.881 --> 02:22:37.749

MAP BUT DIGITAL MAP OF THE STATE

THAT WOULD SHOW. BECAUSE I THINK

02:22:43.521 --> 02:22:44.956
A BIG PROBLEM HERE IS

02:22:45.023 --> 02:22:47.158
TRANSPARENCY AND REALLY KNOWING

02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:48.426
. WHAT WE ARE DOING ON THE

02:22:48.493 --> 02:22:51.262
GROUND- WITH THIS MONEY.

02:22:51.329 --> 02:22:53.331

02:26:53.237 --> 02:26:56.407
AGGREGATORS SO SAD FIVE PRO

02:26:56.474 --> 02:26:58.376
AROUND THE STATE ARE TRYING TO

02:26:58.442 --> 02:27:01.479
RETHINK THE WAY WE MOVE BIOMASS

02:27:01.546 --> 02:27:02.346
AND THE WAY WE GIVE OFF SUPPLY

02:27:02.413 --> 02:27:04.815
GUARANTEES SO THAT IT CREATES A

02:27:04.882 --> 02:27:07.118
MORE STABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:09.887
TO START UP- THESE AT LARGE

02:27:09.954 --> 02:27:12.190
CAPITAL INTENSIVE BUSINESSES

02:27:12.256 --> 02:27:14.659
THAT WILL GET US TO SCALE WE CAN

02:27:14.725 --> 02:27:17.228
START YOU SAYING AT THE FOREST-

02:27:17.295 --> 02:27:23.968
MATERIAL. MORE EFFICIENTLY. OKAY

02:27:24.035 --> 02:27:25.436
AND THEN JUST YOUR ADVENTURE

02:27:25.503 --> 02:27:26.637
THAT SOME PRO FOR JOHN STARTING

02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:28.039
I MEAN THERE'S- ONE THAT OF OUR

02:27:28.105 --> 02:27:28.639
TAKEN A- OF SOME OF THESE. IN

02:27:28.706 --> 02:27:30.341
OUR AND OUR- STARTED STARTING

02:27:30.408 --> 02:27:31.576
BREAK OR WERE GETTING DOWN THE

02:27:31.642 --> 02:27:34.145
ROAD ON THEM. SO THE CLIMATE

02:27:34.212 --> 02:27:35.980
KALISPELL IS JUST ROLLING OUT I

02:27:36.047 --> 02:27:37.381
MEAN I CAN POINT TO PREVIOUS

02:27:37.448 --> 02:27:39.650
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE- FOR

02:27:39.717 --> 02:27:40.985
EXAMPLE THERE'S A MILLION

02:27:41.052 --> 02:27:44.922
DOLLAR. GRANT FROM THAT- TIMBER

02:27:44.989 --> 02:27:45.890
FINE FROM THIS YEAR ABOUT A

02:27:45.957 --> 02:27:49.727
CONSERVANCY. THAT WENT CHIU- I

02:27:49.794 --> 02:27:52.797
MIL UP IN CRESCENT MILLS. THAT

02:27:52.863 --> 02:27:56.133
IS OPENING UP AS WE SPEAK AND-

02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:58.669
ALLOWS THEM TO BE ABLE TO BUILD

02:27:58.736 --> 02:28:00.738
LIFE ON. THE DIXIE FIRE

02:28:00.805 --> 02:28:02.006
FOOTPRINT RIGHT FROM GREENBELT

02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:03.774
ABOUT FIVE MILES DOWN THE ROAD

02:28:03.841 --> 02:28:05.476
MILLING. AND THE BRING IT BACK-

02:28:05.543 --> 02:28:06.344
TO HELP THE CONSTRUCTION OF

02:28:06.410 --> 02:28:07.745
GREENVILLE I MEAN THAT SHORTENS.

02:28:07.812 --> 02:28:09.747
YOUR ON TRAVEL TIME AND ALSO

02:28:09.814 --> 02:28:11.649
OPENS UP- YOU KNOW SOME SMALL

02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:14.318
MILL CAPACITY- WITH WILL THAT'LL

02:28:14.385 --> 02:28:16.921
TAKE IN LARGE I AM- TREES- IT

02:28:16.988 --> 02:28:20.491
RIGHT IN THE MEDIAFIRE.

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:24.095
FOOTPRINT OKAY. AND THEN- SO

02:28:24.161 --> 02:28:25.196
ANOTHER PART WE TALK ABOUT

02:28:25.263 --> 02:28:27.498
FEDERAL STATE PARTNERSHIP AND I

02:28:27.565 --> 02:28:29.834
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT-

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:31.068
BUT WE ALSO YOU KNOW WE KIND OF

02:28:31.135 --> 02:28:32.837
BELIEVE OUT OF THAT PRIVATE AND

02:28:32.903 --> 02:28:33.871
I THINK AS YOU MENTIONED THERE'S

02:28:33.938 --> 02:28:35.706
FORTY PERCENT. OF THE LAND THAT

02:28:35.773 --> 02:28:37.108
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PRIVATELY

02:28:37.174 --> 02:28:39.477
OWNED EITHER BY YOU KNOW- TIMBER

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:42.413
COMPANIES ARE SMALL LANDOWNERS-

02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:44.815
SAY MAKE UP 40% OF THAT WHAT ARE

02:28:44.882 --> 02:28:46.417
WE DOING TO HELP STREAMLINE THE

02:28:46.484 --> 02:28:48.219
PERMITTING PROCESS BECAUSE THAT

02:28:48.286 --> 02:28:49.654
WAS SOMETHING IDENTIFIED. BY

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:51.722
MISTER ANDERSON IS THAT WE KEEP

02:28:51.789 --> 02:28:53.090
TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT RIGHT NOW

02:28:53.157 --> 02:28:54.792
YOU GO TO A T. H. P. AND EVEN

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:58.529
WITH CAL TREES PROGRAM- YOU GET

02:28:58.596 --> 02:29:00.064
THE THV PERMIT BUT THEN IT'S NOT

02:29:00.131 --> 02:29:01.899
STREAMLINED WITH SAY WATER BOARD

02:29:01.966 --> 02:29:04.769

02:29:07.305 --> 02:29:09.407
JUST ONE PROCESS SO THAT. WE CAN

02:29:09.473 --> 02:29:11.108
SPEAK FAST TRACK THESE PRIVATE

02:29:11.175 --> 02:29:13.678
PROJECTS WHICH ARE A BIG PART OF

02:29:13.744 --> 02:29:19.817
THE ISSUE. SO WITH CALTRAIN IS

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:21.185
ASKED WITH THE TIMBER HARVEST

02:29:21.252 --> 02:29:22.286
PLANS THERE'S A COUPLE OF YEARS

02:29:22.353 --> 02:29:24.955
A PERMIT SO YOU'VE GOT- A LOT

02:29:25.022 --> 02:29:26.624

ONLINE TO THIS ONLINE PERMITTING

02:29:31.729 --> 02:29:33.798
PROCESS THAT WE CALL CAL TREES-

02:29:33.864 --> 02:29:35.166
AND THAT HAS ABOUT A FIVE DAY

02:29:35.232 --> 02:29:36.867
TURNAROUND. SO FOR ALL THE

02:29:36.934 --> 02:29:37.968
SALVAGE LOGGING THAT'S GOING

02:29:38.035 --> 02:29:39.603
FORWARD WHICH IS THE MAJORITY OF

02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:40.771
OUR TIMBER HARVEST HAPPENING IN

02:29:40.838 --> 02:29:42.740
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A

02:29:42.807 --> 02:29:44.975
VERY FAST TRACK FOR THAT- WE ARE

02:29:45.042 --> 02:29:46.210
WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD TO HAVE

02:29:46.277 --> 02:29:48.679
CAL TREES TRANSITION. TO BEING

02:29:48.746 --> 02:29:50.247
THAT SORT OF SINGLE APPLICATION

02:29:50.314 --> 02:29:51.315
AND THAT JOINT STREAMLINED

02:29:51.382 --> 02:29:52.783
PROCESS. THIS IS ONE OF THE

02:29:52.850 --> 02:29:55.019
ACTIONS CALLED OUT IN THE TASK

02:29:55.086 --> 02:29:57.788
FORCE- AND I AND WE HAVE THE

02:29:57.855 --> 02:29:59.757
WORKGROUP ESTABLISHED. AROUND IT

02:29:59.824 --> 02:30:01.525
THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD- AND

02:30:01.592 --> 02:30:02.760
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN PROGRESS.

02:30:02.827 --> 02:30:06.330
FROM YEAH AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO

02:30:06.397 --> 02:30:07.531
WITH THE CHAMBER FIND WE'VE SEEN

02:30:07.598 --> 02:30:10.568
THE MEDIAN TIME OR- GREEN TREE

02:30:10.634 --> 02:30:12.970
CAMERAS REVIEWS. GO DOWN FROM

02:30:13.037 --> 02:30:14.138
SIX MONTHS TO ABOUT THREE

02:30:14.205 --> 02:30:17.208
MONTHS- AND- AND SO IN THAT

02:30:17.274 --> 02:30:18.542
TREND HELD OVER THE LAST COUPLE

02:30:18.609 --> 02:30:20.144
YEARS WHICH IS. I'M GOOD

02:30:20.211 --> 02:30:21.712
PROGRESS MORE REMEMBER THAT SAID

02:30:21.779 --> 02:30:22.847
THAT JUDGING HER AS PLAINTIFF A

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:31.222
C. CORP ONE POINT. AT THE MARCH

02:30:31.288 --> 02:30:33.758

NEW FAT HIGH. IS LANDING STATE

02:30:51.609 --> 02:30:52.643
SO SOCIALLY ANYTHING THAT THIS.

02:30:52.710 --> 02:31:01.585
IS FOR. A FIRE- HAS THIS. SECRET

02:31:01.652 --> 02:31:03.587
BEFORE SEACOAST. AFTER UP TO

YEARS IF YOU DO HAVE. SOME TYPE

02:31:05.322 --> 02:31:07.992
OF A MORE. EXEMPTION OR- OTHER-

02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:12.663
FASTER I CATCH. THIS IS THE CAL

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:15.199
. BY DOING CREATED BY YOUR

02:31:15.266 --> 02:31:16.534
MENTAL REVIEW. WORKING THE

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:19.236
ADVICE. CAN A BOY IT DOWN. TO

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:22.573
DOING JUST NEED THE COR BASIC-

02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:24.241
AND I JUST PUTS ON THE- IN ALLAH

02:31:24.308 --> 02:31:26.243
. WHICH ANYBODY. ANYTHING WITH

02:31:26.310 --> 02:31:29.780
YOUR PROJECT HAS TO DO ANYWAY. I

02:31:29.847 --> 02:31:31.582
AND THIS- AND BRINGS THAT PROP

02:31:31.649 --> 02:31:34.285
DOWN TO ABOUT TWO MONTHS- DON'T

02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:36.620
ALLOW US TO A THE STEPS. OF

02:31:36.687 --> 02:31:40.191
THOSE EMPIRE PROTECT. WITHOUT IN

02:31:40.257 --> 02:31:43.227
THE LANKY. BUT WHAT'S REALLY

02:31:43.294 --> 02:31:46.063
IT'S- IS IT IS A FULLY

02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:48.432
SYNCHRONIZED PERMIT. THAT PART

02:31:48.499 --> 02:31:50.968
OFFICIAL. FULLY INTEGRATED THE

02:31:51.035 --> 02:31:55.506
PER STEVE- INTO. WITH THE COUNTY

02:31:55.573 --> 02:31:58.876
P. SO THAT ANYBODY APPLYING FOR

02:31:58.943 --> 02:32:01.879
ACROSS. CAN'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN

02:32:01.946 --> 02:32:05.549
EMPIRE IN THAT'S HOW. THAT WOULD

02:32:05.616 --> 02:32:08.486
. A FISH WILDLIFE PERMIT- THE

02:32:08.552 --> 02:32:10.054
STATE WATER BOARD SAID TO MY

02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:11.889
DOLLARS THAT WE FIND. EARLY

02:32:11.956 --> 02:32:16.327
ACTION. AND ABLE. TO STOP BY.

02:32:16.393 --> 02:32:20.631
WITH NAMES LIST S. WIDE HER NAY

02:32:20.698 --> 02:32:22.433
THAT IS FULL SYNC. WITH THE

02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:30.508
CALIBER. SO IT'S AUTOMATIC. HUGE

02:32:30.574 --> 02:32:33.310
TIME SAVER. IN THIS PROCESS I'M

02:32:33.377 --> 02:32:35.346
IN ANOTHER THING WE DID SO THAT

02:32:35.412 --> 02:32:36.480
PEOPLE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE

02:32:36.547 --> 02:32:39.416
USING IT- AND ENSURING THAT THEY

02:32:39.483 --> 02:32:41.352
UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THAT. IS

02:32:41.418 --> 02:32:42.686
THAT WITH THE EARLY ACTION

02:32:42.753 --> 02:32:44.221
DOLLARS OUT WE ROLLED OUT A

02:32:44.288 --> 02:32:46.423
CONTRACT TO DO FORTY PROJECT

02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:47.892
SPECIFIC ANALYSIS SO ESSENTIALLY

02:32:47.958 --> 02:32:51.762
FORTY- CAL BTP APPLICATIONS- IN

02:32:51.829 --> 02:32:54.031
DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE TYPES AND

02:32:54.098 --> 02:32:55.065
GEOGRAPHIES THROUGHOUT THE

02:32:55.132 --> 02:32:56.967
STATE. SO THAT ANYBODY IS GOING

02:32:57.034 --> 02:33:00.104
TO BE USING CAL BTP PROJECT-

02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:01.272
DOESN'T HAVE TO START FROM

02:33:01.338 --> 02:33:03.107
SCRATCH THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE.

02:33:03.173 --> 02:33:05.776
ALREADY DONE PROJECT TEMPLATES-

02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:07.311
IN YOUR REGION FOR THEIR

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:09.146
VEGETATION THAT THEY CAN JUST

02:33:09.213 --> 02:33:11.615
FOLLOW I'M REALLY CLEARLY AND

02:33:11.682 --> 02:33:13.717
TAKE THE STEPS. IN ACTION STEPS

02:33:13.784 --> 02:33:15.653
THAT ARE OUTLINED- WHEN DOING

02:33:15.719 --> 02:33:16.987
THEIR PROJECTS SO IT'S AN

02:33:17.054 --> 02:33:19.957
INCREDIBLY FAST- PATH TO GETTING

02:33:20.024 --> 02:33:21.358
C. CHOIR AND A FULLY

02:33:21.425 --> 02:33:23.594
SYNCHRONIZED PERMIT. OKAY IS WAS

02:33:23.661 --> 02:33:24.995
THAT WAS THAT WAS A REALLY LONG

02:33:25.062 --> 02:33:27.298
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. BUT I

02:33:27.364 --> 02:33:29.099
WHAT I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:33:29.166 --> 02:33:31.201
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS SO CAL BTP

02:33:31.268 --> 02:33:33.337
ALL START THERE- YOU'RE RIGHT IN

02:33:33.404 --> 02:33:35.072
LA- JUST REPORTED TO US IN THIS

02:33:35.139 --> 02:33:36.407
HEARING. THAT IS NOT REALLY

02:33:36.473 --> 02:33:38.142
BEING UTILIZED VERY VERY MUCH

02:33:38.208 --> 02:33:40.644
AND- AND AS YOU SAID IT ONLY

02:33:40.711 --> 02:33:42.046
COVERS A STATE RESPONSIBILITY

02:33:42.112 --> 02:33:44.148
AREA. WHICH IS A SMALL PORTION

02:33:44.214 --> 02:33:46.183
OF THE ACRES THAT WE NEED- TO

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:47.418
ALTERNATELY TREATED IT'S

02:33:47.484 --> 02:33:49.153
IMPORTANT PORTION. BUT THE

02:33:49.219 --> 02:33:50.387
PEOPLE APPLYING FOR THAT ARE

02:33:50.454 --> 02:33:52.456
MOSTLY CAL ARE MOSTLY FIRE

02:33:52.523 --> 02:33:54.792
COUNCILS. NONPROFITS PUBLIC

02:33:54.858 --> 02:33:56.827
ENTITIES TRYING TO DO THAT WORK.

02:33:56.894 --> 02:33:59.296
AND THEY'RE REPORTING TO ME. AND

02:33:59.363 --> 02:34:01.966
OTHERS THAT THE PROGRAM IS TOO

02:34:02.032 --> 02:34:04.034
INFLEXIBLE AND BURDENSOME. AND

02:34:04.101 --> 02:34:05.536
THEY END UP OPTING FOR OTHER

02:34:05.603 --> 02:34:08.005
METHODS. AND SO VTP IS NOT BEING

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:10.374
UTILIZED. AND IN FACT

02:34:10.441 --> 02:34:12.309
STREAMLINING. PROJECTS IN THAT

02:34:12.376 --> 02:34:13.477
AREA SO THAT'S A PROBLEM RIGHT

02:34:13.544 --> 02:34:15.813
NOW WITH V. T. P. WHAT I WAS

02:34:15.879 --> 02:34:18.315
REFERRING TO- YOU KNOW. T. H.

02:34:18.382 --> 02:34:20.484
FEES YOU KNOW TIMBER HARVEST

02:34:20.551 --> 02:34:22.720
PLANS THAT PRIVATES- SO YOU KNOW

02:34:22.786 --> 02:34:24.421
PRIVATE LOGGING COMPANIES OFTEN

02:34:24.488 --> 02:34:26.490
DO T. H. P.'S TO DO THEIR- TO DO

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:33.063
THEIR- COMMERCIAL TIMBER.

02:34:33.130 --> 02:34:34.365
HARVEST- THEY A TAKE A REAL LONG

02:34:34.431 --> 02:34:36.100
TIME- AND OFTEN THE FOR IS THE

02:34:36.166 --> 02:34:37.301
GET A T. H. PERMIT YOU READY TO

02:34:37.368 --> 02:34:38.035
MOVE FOR AND THEN THE Y. BOARD

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:39.236
COMES IN A SAYS ONE I GOT TO GET

02:34:39.303 --> 02:34:41.538
A PERMIT FROM US OR SOME OTHER

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:43.307
ENTITY GETS ANOTHER AND SO THE

02:34:43.374 --> 02:34:45.342
WHAT THE STREAMLINING MONEY THAT

02:34:45.409 --> 02:34:45.943

ABOUT TWO AND A FIFTY THOUSAND

02:43:18.522 --> 02:43:24.828
ACRES IS PRIVATE. MOST LIKELY.

02:43:24.895 --> 02:43:26.530
FIVE PROBABLY NOT ALL OF THAT

02:43:26.596 --> 02:43:29.833
STREET- IN THOSE YEARS BACK SO I

02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:31.968

WILL- ACCOUNT FOR THE FEDERAL

02:43:53.623 --> 02:43:56.293
OKAY WHAT THOSE AS APPLE'S ALL

02:43:56.359 --> 02:43:57.961
INTO THE SAME BASKET SO WE CAN

02:43:58.028 --> 02:44:00.030
ACCOUNT FOR THEM AND BE ABLE TO

02:44:00.096 --> 02:44:01.798
ADJUST FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S

02:44:01.865 --> 02:44:03.233
COUPLE WARM THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR

02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:05.769
STATE AND PRIVATE WORK AS WELL

02:44:05.835 --> 02:44:07.871
AS ON FEDERAL GROUNDS SO WE SO

WE ARE ABLE TO YOU ARE REALLY-

02:44:12.475 --> 02:44:14.144
EIGHT THE PICTURE. AND HAVING

02:44:14.211 --> 02:44:16.846
BEEN SOMEBODY WHO LIVES THROUGH-

02:44:16.913 --> 02:44:19.816
THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT CAME IN

02:44:19.883 --> 02:44:20.951
THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS FOR

BEETLE KILL THERE TWO HUNDRED

02:44:24.221 --> 02:44:25.522
AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PLUS I

02:44:25.589 --> 02:44:27.691
THINK IT ENDED UP BEING ABOUT

02:44:27.757 --> 02:44:29.326
FIVE HUNDRED OVER SEVEN ABOUT

02:44:29.392 --> 02:44:33.096
SIX. SIX YEARS- THAT MONEY THAT

02:44:33.163 --> 02:44:36.366
CAME IN- WITH THE GOAL POST KEPT

02:44:36.433 --> 02:44:37.601
MOVING FROM THE FEDERAL

02:44:37.667 --> 02:44:39.869
GOVERNMENT ON WHERE WHAT KIND OF

02:44:39.936 --> 02:44:41.538
REPORTING WE NEEDED TO DO OVER

02:44:41.605 --> 02:44:43.940
TIME. WHILE WE'RE WORKING WITH

02:44:44.007 --> 02:44:45.242
AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WITH-

02:44:45.308 --> 02:44:48.144
SERVICIOS IDENTIFYING WITH THE

02:44:48.211 --> 02:44:50.547
TASK FORCE IN PLACE AND THIS IS

02:44:50.614 --> 02:44:51.681
SOMETHING THAT I'M WORKING ON

02:44:51.748 --> 02:44:53.850
WITH MY STATE FORESTERS ACROSS

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:55.752
THE NATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:44:55.819 --> 02:44:58.655
ALL HAVE. THE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT

02:44:58.722 --> 02:45:00.490
FOR AND UTILIZE PROCESSES WE

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:03.360
HAVE IN PLACE. WHAT I FOUND IS

02:45:03.426 --> 02:45:06.296
THAT THE TASK FORCE IS LIGHT

02:45:06.363 --> 02:45:07.998
YEARS AHEAD OF ANY OTHER STATE

02:45:08.064 --> 02:45:10.133

02:45:22.145 --> 02:45:24.347
NATION'S WATER. WHAT ARE THE GUY

02:45:24.414 --> 02:45:26.316
I. ONE ECHO WHAT THE CHAIRS AND

02:45:26.383 --> 02:45:27.417
RESEARCH NEED TO PUSH A FEDERAL

02:45:27.484 --> 02:45:30.287
PART FOR FUNDING AND WORK TO BE

02:45:30.353 --> 02:45:32.055
DONE ON THE FEDERAL LANDS. I

02:45:32.122 --> 02:45:34.858
THINK THE FRUSTRATION THAT THAT

02:45:34.924 --> 02:45:37.494
THAT WE HAVE AS- AT LEAST I'LL

02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:40.463
SPEAK FOR MYSELF IN TERMS OF HOW

02:45:40.530 --> 02:45:42.032
WE'RE- HOW WE'RE- TRACKING WHAT

02:45:42.098 --> 02:45:43.800
WE'RE DOING AS A STATE. IS THAT

02:45:43.867 --> 02:45:45.769
AND I ASK THAT I ASKED I ASKED

02:45:45.835 --> 02:45:47.537
THIS QUESTION TODAY MAYBE YOU

02:45:47.604 --> 02:45:49.205
CAN ANSWER THIS AS WELL IS THAT

02:45:49.272 --> 02:45:51.474
WHAT IS SUCCESS. I LOOKED AT I

02:45:51.541 --> 02:45:53.310
MEAN ALL YOUR PRESENTATIONS OF

02:45:53.376 --> 02:45:54.344
AN INDEPENDENT FUNDING IS

02:45:54.411 --> 02:45:56.112
IMPORTANT. ALL THE PRESENTATIONS

02:45:56.179 --> 02:45:58.081
OF OUTLINED THE AMOUNTS BEING

02:45:58.148 --> 02:46:00.350
SPENT. BUT THE AMOUNTS DOESN'T

02:46:00.417 --> 02:46:04.454
DEFINE SUCCESS. IT'S THE AMOUNT

02:46:04.521 --> 02:46:06.956
. OVERLAID WITH SOMETHING ELSE

02:46:07.023 --> 02:46:08.692
AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE AT THE

02:46:08.758 --> 02:46:09.993
LOOK AT THIS TIME ANALYZE WHAT

02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:12.929
WAS. MENTIONED BY THE VILLAGE OF

02:46:12.996 --> 02:46:14.931
ANNA'S OFFICE IS ACRES TREATED.

02:46:14.998 --> 02:46:17.434
AND SO ARE WE TREATING THE ACRES

02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:21.304
NECESSARY. TO MINIMIZE THESE

02:46:21.371 --> 02:46:24.140
CATS ARE QUALIFIERS. AND AT THE

02:46:24.207 --> 02:46:27.477
VERY MOMENT AND WHETHER IT'S-

02:46:27.544 --> 02:46:29.879
CALVET RADIO OR WHATEVER THEY

02:46:29.946 --> 02:46:31.481
OUTLET IS OR EVEN FOR US IS THAT

02:46:31.548 --> 02:46:33.383
WE HAVING A HARD TIME. GETTING

02:46:33.450 --> 02:46:35.485
THOSE NUMBERS. I GUESS THE

02:46:35.552 --> 02:46:38.188
BROADER QUESTION IS CAN WE EVEN

02:46:38.254 --> 02:46:40.223
GET THESE NUMBERS IN REAL TIME.

02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:42.459
BECAUSE AS AT THE MEET YOU WE

02:46:42.525 --> 02:46:44.828
CERTAINLY ARE TRYING TO. ADDRESS

02:46:44.894 --> 02:46:46.463
THIS- SITUATION A VERY NARROW

02:46:46.529 --> 02:46:48.498
WINDOW I MEAN IS IT POSSIBLE TO

02:46:48.565 --> 02:46:50.200
TRACK ACRES TREATED IN A REAL

02:46:50.266 --> 02:46:51.568
TIME FASHION HIS CAL MAPPER

02:46:51.634 --> 02:47:00.643
THAT- IS THAT THAT THAT PLATFORM. FOUR FUEL REDUCTION

02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:05.648
TREATMENTS- RACKING EIGHTY HE-

02:47:05.715 --> 02:47:07.784
THE TIMELINE IS ON A MONTHLY

02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:10.987
BASIS AND CAL MAPPER IS UPDATED

02:47:11.054 --> 02:47:13.623
ON A MONTHLY BASIS. OKAY BUT I

02:47:13.690 --> 02:47:15.592
WASN'T ACCOUNT FOR IS LAG TIME

02:47:15.658 --> 02:47:19.095
IN REPORTING INTO CAL MAPPER SO

02:47:19.162 --> 02:47:22.031
IF INSPECTORS ARE OUT ON FIRES

02:47:22.098 --> 02:47:27.203
OR- OR MADE MR INSPECTIONAL-

02:47:27.270 --> 02:47:29.606
OVER FIRST ON A PROJECT OR OR

02:47:29.672 --> 02:47:33.810
HIT IT THAT DAY BEFORE ACTUALLY.

02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:35.412
FIVE HUNDRED ACRES WAS BURNT-

02:47:35.478 --> 02:47:37.347
BAND THAT WILL COME BACK INTO

02:47:37.414 --> 02:47:39.649
THE NUMBERS LATER SO THAT'S

02:47:39.716 --> 02:47:40.683
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS. I IT

02:47:40.750 --> 02:47:42.952
BLOCKS THE SCHOOL YEAR CLOSING

02:47:43.019 --> 02:47:44.854
WHAT WE HAVE TO RECONCILE OUR

02:47:44.921 --> 02:47:46.356
NUMBERS BEFORE WE WHAT I CALL

02:47:46.423 --> 02:47:49.159
TOMBSTONE THE ACTUAL NUMBERS FOR

02:47:49.225 --> 02:47:51.394
THE YEAR. IN AND AROUND

02:47:51.461 --> 02:47:53.096
SEPTEMBER BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE

02:47:53.163 --> 02:47:54.697
OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE GOING ON

02:47:54.764 --> 02:47:56.733
IN JUSTIFICATION OF THE OF THE

02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:58.668
ACTUAL ACRES THAT WERE TREATED

02:47:58.735 --> 02:48:01.438
IN THAT FISCAL YEAR SO THAT'S

02:48:01.504 --> 02:48:03.373
WHERE YOU GONNA SEE YES. RAPPER

QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK

02:48:28.264 --> 02:48:29.432

02:58:01.737 --> 02:58:04.140
CAN GET INTO THAT. IN THE MONEY

02:58:04.206 --> 02:58:06.809
AND RESOURCES THAT WE'VE- SENT

02:58:06.876 --> 02:58:09.979
TO ALL THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE

02:58:10.046 --> 02:58:11.080
STATE. THAT WE GET IT DONE. AND

02:58:11.147 --> 02:58:11.881
I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT THANK YOU

02:58:11.947 --> 02:58:14.683
MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU- I JUST

02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:17.620
HAVE ONE QUICK COMMENT- FOR- MS

02:58:17.686 --> 02:58:21.157
QUINN DAVIDSON- AND IT. WHICH IS

02:58:21.223 --> 02:58:22.525
ACTUALLY JUST A REQUEST TO BE IN

02:58:22.591 --> 02:58:24.860
TOUCH WITH- MY STAFF WORK FOR

02:58:24.927 --> 02:58:26.962
MYSELF REGARDING THE INSURANCE

02:58:27.029 --> 02:58:29.065
ISSUE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS

02:58:29.131 --> 02:58:31.300
RAPIDLY BECOMING A CRISIS I

02:58:31.367 --> 02:58:34.537
HEARD ONLY YESTERDAY- FROM A

02:58:34.603 --> 02:58:37.139
CONSTITUENT WHO'S- INSURANCE

02:58:37.206 --> 02:58:39.008
BILL WENT FROM TEN THOUSAND

02:58:39.075 --> 02:58:40.543
DOLLARS A YEAR TO FIFTY THOUSAND

02:58:40.609 --> 02:58:41.744
DOLLARS A YEAR IN THIS. I THINK

02:58:41.811 --> 02:58:44.480
IN MY DISTRICT THERE TENDS TO BE

02:58:44.547 --> 02:58:46.415
A LITTLE BIT OF A- ASSUMPTION

02:58:46.482 --> 02:58:49.652
THAT- EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD TO

02:58:49.718 --> 02:58:51.787
SELF INSURE OR AFFORD THAT KIND

02:58:51.854 --> 02:58:54.490
OF A INSURANCE BILL BUT IN FACT-

02:58:54.557 --> 02:58:55.891
THIS IS GOING TO FORCE A LOT OF

02:58:55.958 --> 02:58:57.593
PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES. IF WE

02:58:57.660 --> 02:59:00.096
DON'T FIND A SOLUTION FOR IT. MR

02:59:00.162 --> 02:59:01.697
FONG DID YOU WANT TO. GET ON ON

02:59:01.764 --> 02:59:02.798
ON THAT AND I HAVE A QUESTION I

02:59:02.865 --> 02:59:04.733
FORGOT TO ASK- FOR BITCOIN

02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:06.769
DAVIDSON AND- YOU MENTIONED THAT

02:59:06.836 --> 02:59:09.171
YOU HAD A NUMBER OF- INDIVIDUALS

02:59:09.238 --> 02:59:11.874
HAD GONE THROUGH- CERTIFICATION

02:59:11.941 --> 02:59:13.509
BUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN APPROVED BY

02:59:13.576 --> 02:59:14.977
THE STATE CAN YOU ELABORATE ON

02:59:15.044 --> 02:59:16.912
THAT. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE HANG

02:59:16.979 --> 02:59:19.181
UP IS OR WHAT THE- IS THERE SOME

02:59:19.248 --> 02:59:21.117
WAY THAT WE CAN HELP WITH OR OR

02:59:21.183 --> 02:59:22.284
OR FACILITATE THAT BECAUSE WE DO

02:59:22.351 --> 02:59:24.086
NEED. FOR BUSES WE NEED MORE

02:59:24.153 --> 02:59:27.256
PRESCRIBED BURNING CAN YOU

02:59:27.323 --> 02:59:27.790
ELABORATE AND GIVE US MORE

02:59:27.857 --> 02:59:29.725
DETAILS ON THAT. YEAH THANK YOU

02:59:29.792 --> 02:59:33.028
I'M- SO. I THINK. THE HANG UP IS

02:59:33.095 --> 02:59:35.064
PRIMARILY IN CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:59:35.131 --> 02:59:36.632
CAL FIRE I THINK THIS IS A NEW

02:59:36.699 --> 02:59:38.834
PROGRAM- AND IT'S SORT OF FINE

02:59:38.901 --> 02:59:40.469
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF THE

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:42.404
AGENCIES ACTUALLY. PRIVATE

02:59:42.471 --> 02:59:43.739
PRACTITIONERS WHO DON'T WORK FOR

02:59:43.806 --> 02:59:44.640
CALIFORNIA DON'T WORK TO THE

02:59:44.707 --> 02:59:46.909
STATE. NECESSARILY AND SO I

02:59:46.976 --> 02:59:48.944
THINK THERE'S JUST A LOT OF ROOM

02:59:49.011 --> 02:59:50.579
TO GROWING PAINS AND TRYING TO

02:59:50.646 --> 02:59:51.514
FIGURE OUT HOW TO ROLL THIS

02:59:51.580 --> 02:59:53.415
PROGRAM OUT. AND HOW TO MAKE IT

02:59:53.482 --> 02:59:55.017
MAKE SENSE IF WITH THE SYSTEM

02:59:55.084 --> 02:59:58.187
THAT'S IN PLACE- THAT SAID I

02:59:58.254 --> 02:59:59.688
THINK IT'S ALSO BEEN KIND OF PUT

02:59:59.755 --> 03:00:01.924
ON THE BACKBURNER AND- AND NOT

03:00:01.991 --> 03:00:03.325
BEEN GIVEN THE ATTENTION THAT IT

03:00:03.392 --> 03:00:04.793
NEEDS AND- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN

03:00:04.860 --> 03:00:05.628
TRYING TO WORK WITH CAL FIRE

03:00:05.694 --> 03:00:07.163
JUST TO. MAKE SURE TO ELEVATE

03:00:07.229 --> 03:00:08.497
THIS AND SAY. YOU KNOW THE

03:00:08.564 --> 03:00:09.899
CURRENT SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN

03:00:09.965 --> 03:00:10.733
PLACE ARE NOT GOING TO

03:00:10.799 --> 03:00:12.635
FACILITATE THIS PROGRAMS WE NEED

03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:13.936
TO RETHINK THOSE SYSTEMS

03:00:14.003 --> 03:00:15.804
BECAUSE- WE NEED THESE PEOPLE

03:00:15.871 --> 03:00:17.473
AND WE CANNOT WAIT ANOTHER YEAR

03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:18.941
WE CAN EVEN WAIT ANOTHER TWO

03:00:19.008 --> 03:00:21.143
MONTHS- WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE

03:00:21.210 --> 03:00:22.745
THIS HAPPEN SO. I DAY I KNOW

03:00:22.811 --> 03:00:23.712
THEY JUST MET YESTERDAY I

03:00:23.779 --> 03:00:25.447
HAVEN'T HAD AN UPDATE ON NOT YET

03:00:25.514 --> 03:00:27.149
BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S ABOUT

03:00:27.216 --> 03:00:28.918
COMMITTING TO. TO A DIFFERENT

03:00:28.984 --> 03:00:30.252
WAY OF DOING THINGS AND IT'S A

03:00:30.319 --> 03:00:31.820
LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE PROBABLY

03:00:31.887 --> 03:00:33.122
FOR THAT YOU KNOW PROFESSIONAL

03:00:33.189 --> 03:00:37.560
FIRE ORGANIZATION. BUT IT'S

03:00:37.626 --> 03:00:38.594
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

03:00:38.661 --> 03:00:40.196
I CERTAINLY. YOUR A VIRGIN AND I

03:00:40.262 --> 03:00:42.264

COMMITTED TO WORKING THROUGH-

03:01:38.387 --> 03:01:40.656
THE CERTIFICATION ISSUES BUT THE

03:01:40.723 --> 03:01:43.158

YEAR THAT'S GOING TO HELP THAT

03:02:14.823 --> 03:02:16.592
IMPORTANT TOOL AND I THINK IT'S

03:02:16.659 --> 03:02:18.827
A KIND OF REDISCOVERING IN SOME

03:02:18.894 --> 03:02:20.963
WAYS THAT IMPORTANT TOOL- IN

03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:24.033
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE- IN OUR

03:02:24.099 --> 03:02:26.435
PLAN LIKE DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE

03:02:26.502 --> 03:02:27.436
OF HOW MANY ACRES HE MIGHT TRY

03:02:27.503 --> 03:02:30.939
TO- TREAT WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE

03:02:31.006 --> 03:02:36.111
OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO. AND

03:02:36.178 --> 03:02:37.980

ACRES AND I AM A SUPER TYPE A

03:02:48.090 --> 03:02:50.025
PERSON AND LOVE NOTHING MORE

03:02:50.092 --> 03:02:51.060
THAN JUST BEING ABLE TO SIT DOWN

03:02:51.126 --> 03:02:53.262
AND COUNT SOMETHING UP- THANK

03:02:53.329 --> 03:02:54.697
YOU JUST ONE ADVOCATE FOR YOU

03:02:54.763 --> 03:02:56.465
ALL TO REMEMBER THAT THIS

03:02:56.532 --> 03:02:58.500
PROBLEM ISN'T AS SIMPLE AS JUST

03:02:58.567 --> 03:02:59.902
TELLING ACRES I THINK WE ALL

03:02:59.968 --> 03:03:01.770
KNOW THAT IT'S ABOUT. YES IT'S

03:03:01.837 --> 03:03:03.138
ABOUT THE RIGHT ACRES AND

03:03:03.205 --> 03:03:04.440
GETTING THOSE ACRES OUT BUT IT'S

03:03:04.506 --> 03:03:06.275
ALSO ABOUT A LOT OF QUALITY TO

03:03:06.342 --> 03:03:07.676
THINGS THAT ARE HARDER TO MAYBE

03:03:07.743 --> 03:03:09.244
WRAP OUR HEAD AROUND BUT

03:03:09.311 --> 03:03:11.113
CRITICAL LIKE. BUILDING A

03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:12.381
QUALIFIED WORKFORCE TO PLAY

03:03:12.448 --> 03:03:13.816
THESE APPROACHES IT'S ABOUT

03:03:13.882 --> 03:03:15.484
RESHAPING OUR ECONOMY SO THE

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:16.885
PROFESSIONALS CAN EARN A LIVING

03:03:16.952 --> 03:03:19.288
WAGE IT'S ABOUT CHANGING FEDERAL

03:03:19.355 --> 03:03:20.856
AND STATE PROCUREMENT MECHANISMS

03:03:20.923 --> 03:03:22.257
THAT WE CAN DO THINGS IN A WAY

03:03:22.324 --> 03:03:24.126
THAT MAKES SENSE IT'S ABOUT.

03:03:24.193 --> 03:03:26.161
ADJUSTING STATE AGENCIES WAY OF

03:03:26.228 --> 03:03:27.696
DOING BUSINESS SO THAT YOU'RE

03:03:27.763 --> 03:03:29.698
NOT TRAINING CAPACITY BY NOT

03:03:29.765 --> 03:03:30.899
PAYING THEM FOR THE ACTUAL

03:03:30.966 --> 03:03:33.135
OVERHEAD REACH- I THINK THESE

03:03:33.202 --> 03:03:34.603
ISSUES ARE REALLY ABOUT

03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:36.538
INVESTING ORGANIZATIONAL

03:03:36.605 --> 03:03:39.408
TECHNICAL CAPACITY OF. OVER TWO

03:03:39.475 --> 03:03:40.008
HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS IN THE

03:03:40.075 --> 03:03:42.511
STATE WHO WANT TO BE AND WHO ARE

03:03:42.578 --> 03:03:43.812
PARTNERS TO DO THIS WORK BUT

03:03:43.879 --> 03:03:46.048
THERE'S FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL

03:03:46.115 --> 03:03:47.850
DESIGN PROBLEMS THAT STOPS THE

03:03:47.916 --> 03:03:50.052
BOTTLENECK RIGHT. THAT'S WHEN I

03:03:50.119 --> 03:03:51.553
SEE A WATERSHED CENTER WHEN I

03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:53.956
SIT DOWN TO ASK OUR FORRESTER

03:03:54.022 --> 03:03:54.923
ONE STOPPING YOU FROM TAKING ON

03:03:54.990 --> 03:03:56.225
MORE PROJECTS WHAT'S STOPPING

03:03:56.291 --> 03:03:58.160
YOU FROM DOING. WORK AT A

03:03:58.227 --> 03:03:59.595
GREATER SCALE THAT'S THE ANSWER

03:03:59.661 --> 03:04:00.996
TO THAT QUESTION I GOT FROM

03:04:01.063 --> 03:04:02.664
THOSE TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS

03:04:02.731 --> 03:04:04.933
LIKE THESE SIMPLE. THINGS LIKE

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:06.769
OVERHEAD MIGHT SEEM REALLY I'M

03:04:06.835 --> 03:04:08.003
COMPILING IT MIGHT NOT BE AS

03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:10.439
LIKE POLITICAL BUT I THINK TAKE

03:04:10.506 --> 03:04:11.673
TAKE A STANCE ON IT SOMETHING

03:04:11.740 --> 03:04:13.375
LIKE PLANNING OR PERMITTING YOUR

03:04:13.442 --> 03:04:15.544
MONEY TO CONCORD SPENT. I JUST

03:04:15.611 --> 03:04:17.212
WANT TO SHARE YOU WITH YOU THAT

03:04:17.279 --> 03:04:19.047
THAT IS. THE WATERSHEDS

03:04:19.114 --> 03:04:21.016
PERSPECTIVE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE

03:04:21.083 --> 03:04:29.124
THAT'S REALLY STANDING LAMP.

03:04:29.191 --> 03:04:30.192
MORE GOOD WORK GETTING DONE-

03:04:30.259 --> 03:04:30.826
MALL TYPE APPROACH AND THAT'S

03:04:30.893 --> 03:04:31.927
KIND OF WHY. MY INITIAL. ON THE

03:04:31.994 --> 03:04:32.561
PROCESS AND LOT OF THINGS STAND

03:04:32.628 --> 03:04:34.329
IN WAY- BUT IS THERE AN ESTIMATE

03:04:34.396 --> 03:04:35.631
ON LIKE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY

03:04:35.697 --> 03:04:37.499
TO DO IN TERMS OF ESTIMATED A

03:04:37.566 --> 03:04:39.401
PRESCRIBED FIRE TREATMENTS.

03:04:39.468 --> 03:04:39.935
BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S AN

03:04:40.002 --> 03:04:42.671
IMPORTANT. AND IF YOU GET TO

03:04:42.738 --> 03:04:44.072
KNOW LIKE WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO

03:04:44.139 --> 03:04:49.745
DO OVER THE NET IN THE IMMEDIATE. I CAN CHIME IN ON THAT- AND I

03:04:49.812 --> 03:04:51.580
TOTALLY SECOND WED ALISON SAID

03:04:51.647 --> 03:04:52.948
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ACRES

03:04:53.015 --> 03:04:54.450
ST. IT'S REALLY ABOUT VESTING

03:04:54.516 --> 03:04:56.351
PEOPLE AND OF THE STRUCTURAL

03:04:56.418 --> 03:04:58.120
CHANGES BUT- THAT'S SAID THAT

03:04:58.187 --> 03:05:00.022
STRATEGIC- PLAN FOR PRESCRIBED

03:05:00.088 --> 03:05:01.523
FIRE THAT I MENTION OF THE

03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:03.358
GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE. HAS ONE

03:05:03.425 --> 03:05:04.593
BEEN WORKING NOT. CLEARLY

03:05:04.660 --> 03:05:06.895
OUTLINED SOME ACREAGE TARGETS

03:05:06.962 --> 03:05:08.163
FOR DIFFERENT ENTITIES SO FOR

03:05:08.230 --> 03:05:10.532
FEDERAL STATE PRIVATE PARTNERS.

03:05:10.599 --> 03:05:12.034
I'M SO YOU COULD LOOK TO THAT

03:05:12.100 --> 03:05:14.002
AND SEE SOME PRETTY SPECIFIC

03:05:14.069 --> 03:05:16.305
NUMBERS THAT ARE LAID OUT- I DID

03:05:16.371 --> 03:05:17.473
WANT TO CORRECT ONE THING THAT

03:05:17.539 --> 03:05:19.741
THE CHIEF PORTER SAID ABOUT THE-

03:05:19.808 --> 03:05:21.610
THE BURN BOSSES BECAUSE- YOU

03:05:21.677 --> 03:05:23.178
MENTIONED IT. BUT NO ONE WHO HAD

03:05:23.245 --> 03:05:24.480
A FIGHTER TAKING THE COURSE HAD

03:05:24.546 --> 03:05:25.647
MET TO MEET THE MINIMUM

03:05:25.714 --> 03:05:27.182
REQUIREMENTS AND- THAT'S NOT

03:05:27.249 --> 03:05:29.451
TRUE IT'S JUST- WE ACTUALLY HAD

03:05:29.518 --> 03:05:30.752
NINE PEOPLE IN THAT CLASS WHO

03:05:30.819 --> 03:05:32.621
ARE TYPE TWO. FEDERALLY

03:05:32.688 --> 03:05:34.289
QUALIFIED BURN BOSSES WITH

03:05:34.356 --> 03:05:35.691
DECADES OF EXPERIENCE SO

03:05:35.757 --> 03:05:37.326
ACTUALLY FAR EXCEED THE

03:05:37.392 --> 03:05:38.360
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STATE

03:05:38.427 --> 03:05:40.162
CERTIFICATION. I THINK IT'S

03:05:40.229 --> 03:05:41.563
JUST- WE'RE DEALING WITH

03:05:41.630 --> 03:05:43.298
MATCHING DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN.

03:05:43.365 --> 03:05:45.033
CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR OWN SYSTEMS

03:05:45.100 --> 03:05:47.636
THEY DON'T REALLY- EASILY MERGE

03:05:47.703 --> 03:05:49.104
WITH THE FEDERAL QUALIFICATIONS

03:05:49.171 --> 03:05:51.173
OR WITH THE- PRIVATE SIDE SO I

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:52.407
THINK. YOU KNOW THE OLYMPIAN

03:05:52.474 --> 03:05:53.942
HE'S OR CULTURAL ISSUES THAT

03:05:54.009 --> 03:05:55.277
NEED TO WORK AROUND BUT A LOT OF

03:05:55.344 --> 03:05:56.812
ITS WITHIN HEALTHCARE CULTURE

03:05:56.879 --> 03:05:57.779
AND THAT THEY'RE KIND OF SILO

03:05:57.846 --> 03:05:58.914
DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN SYSTEMS IN

03:05:58.981 --> 03:06:00.849
PLACE. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

03:06:00.916 --> 03:06:02.384
FIGURE OUT HOW TO RECOGNIZE

03:06:02.451 --> 03:06:03.852
OTHER WAYS OF DOING THINGS.

03:06:03.919 --> 03:06:05.354
INCLUDING THAT SOME KIND OF

03:06:05.420 --> 03:06:06.688
PRIMARY PRESCRIBED FIRE

03:06:06.755 --> 03:06:07.856
QUALIFICATION SYSTEM WHICH IS

03:06:07.923 --> 03:06:09.658
THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. SO I JUST

03:06:09.725 --> 03:06:16.465
WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS THAT

03:06:16.532 --> 03:06:17.633
WAS IN THERE. TO CLEAR THE WRECK

03:06:17.699 --> 03:06:19.635
- I SAID SIR. A HEAD OF TIME.

03:06:19.701 --> 03:06:20.702
MEANING SIR. INTO THE PRO. SO

03:06:20.769 --> 03:06:21.770
THAT'S WHAT'S DONE THERE WE'RE

03:06:21.837 --> 03:06:24.106
WE ARE READY. THOSE AS WE SPEAK-

03:06:24.172 --> 03:06:25.507
THERE'S A THE TEAM HAS BEEN

03:06:25.574 --> 03:06:26.675
PULLED TOGETHER. WHILE THEY'RE

03:06:26.742 --> 03:06:28.911
FOLLOWING THE- PROCESS THAT WAS

03:06:28.977 --> 03:06:31.713
PUT IN PLACE BY. THE TEAM THAT

03:06:31.780 --> 03:06:34.216
LANIER WAS A PARTNERSHIP THAT

03:06:34.283 --> 03:06:35.284
BUILT THIS PROGRAM. IT'S ALL ON

03:06:35.350 --> 03:06:39.655
PROGRESS. SO YOU MEANT THAT IS A

03:06:39.721 --> 03:06:41.056
QUICK QUESTION TO GET IS AN

03:06:41.123 --> 03:06:42.457
ESTIMATE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING BUT

03:06:45.093 --> 03:06:46.194
QUICKLY REALLY GOT TO WRAP THIS

03:06:46.261 --> 03:06:47.996

FIVE HUNDRED WHERE WE HAD ON

03:07:03.378 --> 03:07:05.547
THAT CHIEF AND- IT WAS THE

03:07:05.614 --> 03:07:09.384
STATUS OF. OF DOING THOSE HIGH

03:07:09.451 --> 03:07:10.619
PRIORITY FUEL BREAKS. ON THE-

03:07:10.686 --> 03:07:13.021
CAL MAPPER WEBSITE- THE

03:07:13.088 --> 03:07:15.557
DASHBOARD SHOWS THE NUMBER OF

03:07:15.624 --> 03:07:18.694
PROJECTS THAT ARE IN PLAY- IN. A

03:07:18.760 --> 03:07:20.696
VERY US LEVELS OF TREATMENT. ARE

03:07:20.762 --> 03:07:23.265
THERE ARE OVER FIVE HUNDRED

03:07:23.332 --> 03:07:25.467

03:07:25.534 --> 03:07:27.536
THIS FISCAL YEAR AND THERE WERE

03:07:27.603 --> 03:07:29.771
LAST YEAR AS WELL SO. THAT WILL

03:07:29.838 --> 03:07:30.639
BE THE PLACE TO GO AND TRACK

03:07:30.706 --> 03:07:32.741
THAT. RIGHT WHEN YOU CROSS THE

03:07:32.808 --> 03:07:33.842
FISCAL YEAR IT'S GOING TO BE A

03:07:33.909 --> 03:07:35.043
SMALLER NUMBER JUST AT THE

03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:37.379
BEGINNING BUT IT. RAPIDLY RAMPS

03:07:37.446 --> 03:07:39.748
UP. OKAY AND THEN JUST ON THE

03:07:39.815 --> 03:07:41.617

EVEN THE PRISON CAMPS. I THINK

03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:05.841

03:08:20.689 --> 03:08:22.024
RECOGNIZED BUT THEY GOT BY THE
