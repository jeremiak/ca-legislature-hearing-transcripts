THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO SPEAK- EVEN THOUGH THAT SPEECH ISN'T NECESSARILY PREFERRED BY THOSE TO WHOM THAT SPEECH IS BEING DIRECTED THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS SUCH A CRITICAL COMPONENT.

LIKE BOX EVERY TIME. OKAY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD. LET'S GO AHEAD TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SENATORS LET ME FIRST START AS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND LEND MY SALUTE ON THE HALF OF OUR COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP- IN PROTECTING THE CONSTITUTION AND HELPING TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL WHICH IS TRULY I THINK INDICATIVE OF YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS COMMITTEE- TO YOUR COLLEAGUES- YOU'RE AMAZING SHARES SPENT MANY MEETINGS WITH US- WE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS- AND THAT IS NOT ONLY INDICATIVE THROUGH THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS BUT- NOT THROUGH THE MANY AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE ADDED TO THIS BILL- TO IMPROVE THE BILL. BUT TO THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING THIS AND I ALSO VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING ON TO THIS BILL AS A AS THE SENATOR- PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX WAS WRITTEN TO AVERT A CRISIS. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON WHICH MADAM CHAIR SERVICE RECENTLY DECIDED TO LIFT ITS STATE WIDE TEMPORARY FICTION MORATORIUM. ON SEPTEMBER THE FIRST. WHEN THE TEMPORARY FICTION BAN EXPIRES. ALL RANCHERS IN OUR STATE. WILL IMMEDIATELY- ANY. AND ALL UNPAID RENT AT ONCE. AND IF WE DON'T CHANGE STATE LAW IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. WE WILL SEE A MASSIVE WAVE OF EVICTIONS. THIS WILL BE CATASTROPHIC FOR TENANTS. PROPERTY OWNERS HOMELESSNESS AND COVERED NINETEEN SPREAD. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. MANY TENANTS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT. RENTERS HAVE HAD TO STAY HOME. TO COMPLY WITH SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS AND COUNTLESS CALIFORNIANS HAVE LOST JOBS IN INCOME AS ECONOMY HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN. WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ACTION MANY WILL LOSE THEIR HOME AT A TIME WHEN COVERED CASES ARE STILL DANGEROUSLY HIGH. I THINK EVERY MEMBER OF OUR LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDS HOW UNFAIR THIS HAS BEEN. GOVERNMENT ORDER PEOPLE TO STAY HOME TO PREVENT COLDS FRED. WE HAVEN'T PASSED NEW LAWS TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE DON'T LOSE THEIR HOMES. AND FOR SENSE OF THE SCALE THE CRISIS. US CENSUS DATA FROM JULY NINTH TO THE FOURTEENTH INDICATED OVER FOUR POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIA RENTERS REPORT QUOTE LITTLE OR NO CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY NEXT MONTH'S RENT. WELL ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS HAVE INDICATED THE SAME LITTLE OR NO CONFIDENCE ABOUT MAKING THEIR NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT. AND WE KNOW THAT SINCE JULY NINTH TO THE FOURTEENTH THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR IN WEEKLY FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT HAS EXPIRED. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX ALLOWS TENANTS HOMEOWNERS AND SMALL LANDLORDS IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS TO TEMPORARILY THE FOR RENT AND MORTGAGE PAYMENTS UNTIL HOPEFULLY THE WORST OF THE PANDEMIC HAS PASSED. BUT I KNOW THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE FULL EVENTUAL REPAYMENT OF ALL DEFERRED AMOUNTS. THIS BILL HAS TO HOUSE PROTECTIONS FOR STRUGGLING TENANTS AND PROTECTIONS FOR STRUGGLING PROPERTY OWNERS AND LANDLORDS. ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE IF WE DON'T CHANGE STATE LAW TENANTS WILL BE AFFECTED AND LANDLORDS WILL NEVER GET THE MONIES THAT THEIR OWN. THIS BILL SIMPLE IT SAYS TENANTS SHOULD BE SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED. FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THE RENT DURING. OUR COVERT STATE OF EMERGENCY. THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME TIME TO EVENTUALLY PAY THE BACK RENT THAT THEY WROTE. OUR GOAL IS TO GIVE RUNNERS A CHANCE TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. WHILE GIVING LANDLORDS AWAY TO RECOVER RENT WITHOUT EXPENSIVE EVICTION CASES. AND AGAIN LET ME STRESS OUR BILL DOES NOT CANCEL RENT OR RELIEF TENANTS OF THEIR OBLIGATION TO PAY. INSTEAD TO GIVE TENANTS A BREAK TO WEATHER THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. DISCUSS THE PROPERTY OWNER AMANDA PROTECTIONS OF THIS BILL. POLEMIC WE MUST PROTECT STRUGGLING TENANTS FROM EVICTIONS AND STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS AND LANDLORDS FROM FORECLOSURE WE SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW A MASS WAVE OF EVICTIONS AND FORECLOSURES TO OCCUR IN CALIFORNIA ON OUR WATCH. THE HUMAN SUFFERING WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARY. IT WOULD LEAD TO ENORMOUS INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS AND COVERED SPREAD AND IT WOULD TURN A DEEP RECESSION INTO A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY GREAT DEPRESSION. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT WITH AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX THIS BILL IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THE TENANTS AND HOMEOWNERS ARE NOT AFFECTED FORCED OUT ONTO THE STREETS GERMANY GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE ALMOST TWENTY CO AUTHORS OF OUR BILL. AND TURN IT OVER TO THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BANKING COMMITTEE AND OUR LEAD TO JOINT AUTHORS SIMPLY NEVER MEDICALLY MONTH. TO DISCUSS. A NUMBER OF OTHER PROVISIONS BILL. MISSING ON. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU N. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEóN THE FLOOR SHORES. THANK YOU CHAIR AND SENATORS AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX ADDRESSES CRITICAL QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN FORCED UPON US DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN TECHNOMIC. DUE TO THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE VIRUS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONTAIN CONTAIN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS OR HAVE SEEN DRASTIC REDUCTIONS IN THEIR INCOMES. THE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THAT WERE HELPING HOUSEHOLDS TO KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER HAVE EXPIRED. WITH RENT MORTGAGES AND OTHER BILLS COMING DUE. HOW ARE CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES GOING TO COPE WITH THIS TEMPORARY REALITY. AS POLICY MAKERS WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS PREVENT THE WORST OUTCOMES THAT WILL RESULT. IF NOTHING GETS DONE. WE CANNOT STAND BY AND HOPE FOR THE BEST WHEN SO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR FRIENDS OUR FAMILIES OUR NEIGHBORS ARE FACING DIRE THREAT OF BEING DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOME. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX IS A PROPOSAL FOR STABILIZING THE HOUSING SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA AS WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO FIGHT THIS HEALTH PANDEMIC. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU HAS MADE A STRONG CASE FOR THE TENANT PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL. AND I WILL FOCUS ON THE HOMEOWNER AND LAMBERT PROTECTIONS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BEST SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. WOULD BE THE MEDIA ALLOCATION OF FUNDING TO HELP TENANTS LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE FACING FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS DUE TO THE VIRUS. BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO ACT AND WE KNOW FROM PASSING OUR OWN STATE BUDGET IN JUNE THAT THE STATE SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES. TO EXPLORE THAT OPTION. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SUPPLEMENTING THE INCOMES TODAY AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX PROPOSES MECHANISM FOR DEFERRING EXPENSES UNTIL THE WORST OF THE CRISIS HAS SUBDUED. MR TO DESCRIBE HOW THESE MECHANISMS THAT WOULD WORK FOR TENANTS BUT THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR HOMEOWNERS AND LANDLORDS TO RECEIVE SIMILAR RELIEF BY SEEKING MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE THROUGH THEIR SERVICER. AS REFLECTED INTHE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE PROVISIONS OF AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX BUILT AROUND AND LARGELY REFLECT THE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED TO BARS UNDER THE FEDERAL CARES ACT. WELL THE CURES ACT PROVIDES PROTECTIONS TO BAR IS A FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES SIMILAR LEGAL PROTECTIONS DO NOT EXIST FOR OTHER MORTGAGE BORROWERS WHICH REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 30% OR MORE OF CALIFORNIA'S MARKET. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE MORTGAGE PREVENTS OF THIS BILL ARE THE FOLLOWING. FIRST PROVIDE A SIMILAR LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR BARS OF NON FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS AS THE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED FOR THE FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS. SECOND ENSURE THAT HELPFUL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO BORROWERS SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE TERMS OF FORBEARANCE. AND THE POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OPTIONS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO THEM AFTER THE FORBEARANCE PERIOD ENDS. THIRD PROVIDE A LEGAL REMEDY TO BORROW SO THAT THEY CAN PROTECT THEIR HOME FROM FOR CLOSURE IN THE EVENT THAT AMERICA MORTGAGE SERVICER HAS NOT OFFERED THEM FORBEARANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CARERS ACT. WITH THIS BILL WE ARE NOT REQUIRING THAT PAYMENTS BE CANCELLED OR FORGIVEN. WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT ANYONE CAN STOP PAYING THEIR MORTGAGE THESE PROTECTIONS ARE LIMITED TO ONLY THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCE THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR IS MORE TIME TO MAKE PAYMENTS AND TO GIVE OUR CONSTITUENTS SOME FORM OF STABILITY IN THESE VERY UNCERTAIN TIMES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- WILL NOW GO TO ANYONE WANTING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS. AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS I HAVE INSTITUTED TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY THOSE MAIN WITNESSES AND IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WILL BE ALLOWED A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES FOR EACH SIDE. ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURE I'M GONNA REPEAT THAT BECAUSE I'M TOLD WE'VE GOT AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE NOW. LINED UP WHO WISH TO INDICATE I BELIEVE IT WERE ON THE SUPPORT SIDE OF THIS SO WE ARE GOING TO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LISTENING. AFTER WE HAVE OUR TWO MAIN WITNESSES WE ARE GOING TO SIMPLY ALLOW YOU TO GIVE US YOUR NAME YOUR AFFILIATION WHETHER IT'S AN ORGANIZATION OR WHETHER YOU'RE JUST A TENANT OR JUST A PERSON ON THE STREET. JUST TELL US WHO YOU ARE. AND THEN YOUR POSITION IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I DON'T MEAN JUST THE PERSON ON THE STREET YOU ARE AS IMPORTANT AS ANYONE ELSE BUT- WE WANT YOUR NAME YOUR AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL. AND IF YOU KEEP TALKING I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE WHEN IT CUTS OFF. WE'VE GOT- TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO. STEP IN AND STEP UP AND WE WANT TO LET EACH IF YOU GIVE US YOUR YOUR NAME SO WITH THAT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE. JEREMY MILLER GENEVIEVE A- PRICELESS. AND BRIAN A GUSTO OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT OF MODERATOR IS THAT CORRECT. I'M JUST LIKE pA BRIAN IS HERE YES HI. THEY LIKE TO NINE- GERMAN FORTUNATELY IS WAS OUR TENANT ADVOCATE AND HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL SO HE WILL NO THAT'S OKAY THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT AND WE WISH.

YES WE DO HAVE A HEN- REVERT YOU FLUFF ON THE PHONE SHE'S ME HEAD OF THE MY APOLOGIES- SO WHY DON'T WE START WITH YOU HAVE A VISA AND- AGAIN TOGETHER YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES AND I'M GOING TO BE. KIND OF STRICT ABOUT THIS SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU SHARE THOSE TWO MINUTES EACH. AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD. OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AND ALL THAT BY EACH LAP I AM A LANDMARK AMONG OTHER LABOR LABELS I'M ALSO AN ELECTED OFFICIAL A MOM A FRIEND AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATE AND IN NEED OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. I AM FAIRLY NEW TO BEING A LANDMARK HARPER I AM NOT NEW TO POLICY. AND I KNOW THE JOB OF POLICY IN THE JOB OF GOVERNMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE DOES THEIR PART. FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY TO SUPPORT STRONGER SOCIETY. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX DOES THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED. QUITE A LOT. AT TEN MILLION FELLOW CAL. AT THE LAND I YOU NEED TO PROTECT. JUST LIKE THE TENANT WHO LIVE IN MY HOME AND OTHER. AND COURSE. EVERY DAY. LIKE THEM I TO KNOW THAT I WILL NOT BE AT MY HOUSE. I NEED TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN MYSELF MY FAMILY- THAT'S QUITE THAT. UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. AN IDEAL WAY TO AVOID A LOOMING HOUSING CATASTROPHE AND WORSENING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN CALIFORNIA. IT TURNS YOUR LEGISLATION ADDRESSING THE FINANCIAL MEANS ABOUT. MEMBERS EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY QUICKLY BACK. I NEED AND FOR THAT WE I SUPPORT IT I HAD CHOSEN QUICKLY CLIMB FROM DAY TO DAY COULD CLASSIFY BECAUSE I SUPPORT THE- DEPT IN WORD LOOK AGENT.

THEY CAN CLEAN AND CARE FOR OUR KIDS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR EIGHT VOTE FOR MY SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR MY NEIGHBORS THANK YOU. AND FOR OUR STATE THANK YOU UNCLE. THIRTY FIVE PM. THANK YOU SO MUCH TEST FROM MR GUSTER THE- YOU YOU GO ABOUT TWO MEN CENTER SECONDS. OUT OF CHAIR AND MEMBERS RYAN ADDRESSED ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. AND THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. A PART OF A GROUP OF ORGANIZATIONS SPONSORING THIS MEASURE. JUST A FEW POINTS. NEAR THE STATE WE'RE IN A ONCE IN A GENERATION. ECONOMIC CRISIS AS A RESULT OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND LIKE MUCH OF THE DECISIVE ACTION THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN. TO DATE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH WE BELIEVE EQUALLY BOLD. AND DECISIVE ACTION IS NEEDED TO- STABILIZE THE RENTAL HOUSING MARKET AND PROTECT RENTERS FROM THE FOLLOWING CATASTROPHE OF THE POTENTIAL OF MASS EVICTIONS. WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE AS WE JUST HEARD FROM A PREVIOUS WITNESS THAT WE PROTECT SMALL LANDLORDS WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A CRISIS FOR. ALL SECTORS. BERMAN BUT ONE CRITICAL PIECE OF THE POLICY TO SOLVE THAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY AN ESSENTIAL POLICY OF THIS AS AS BOTH AUTHORS HAVE TALKED ABOUT. IS THAT WE SHOULD NOT PUNISH TENANTS. SIMPLY BECAUSE THROUGH ADDICTION FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL THE STATE HOME THEY DIDN'T GO TO WORK WE ASK THEM TO DO THAT THEY'VE DONE THAT AND NOW WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM. FROM EVICTION. BUT ONE CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS THAT THIS HAS IMPACTED FOUR POINT ONE MILLION RENTER HOUSEHOLDS 31% OF. HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA MAYBE AS MUCH AS 42% OR MORE WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE KNOW. THAT THOSE FOLKS FACE A CLIFF IF WE DO NOT ACT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNS AND ONE WAY IN WHICH WE CAN ACT IS TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT THEM FROM THE VENTURA TAKING AFFECTION OFF THE TABLE BUT AS MR CHIU HAS SAID THAT WE ARE NOT. WAVING THE RENT. BUT TO ALLOW A MASSIVE REDUCTIONS WILL NOT SOLVE THIS CRISIS IT WILL NOT PUT MORE MONEY IN ANYBODY'S POCKET WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT ALL THOSE HOUSEHOLDS. AND WE AND PUT THIS POLICY IN PLACE TO PROTECT THOSE MILLIONS OF RENTERS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE FIND THEMSELVES DISPLACED OR HOMELESS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ORIGINAL VOTE.

CALLING FOR STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS CALLED THE IN OR HAS BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING IN LINE IF YOU WERE NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR TESTIMONY THROUGH EMAIL OVER THE PORTAL OR THROUGH THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE GIVEN EQUAL TIMES A TO BOTH THOSE IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION BUT IF YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO GET IN THE QUEUE OR BE HEARD. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO GET YOUR POSITION TO US THROUGH EMAIL OVER THE PORTAL OR THROUGH THE COMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT COLLEAGUES WE ARE GOING TO BRING THIS BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION. AND AS THE CHAIR I'M GOING TO TAKE THE PRIVILEGE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ON THIS BILL- THAT- I KNOW HAS BEEN A- SOURCE OF. GREAT CHALLENGE TO ITS AUTHORS AND APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S. NATIONAL POSITIONS- EITHER IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. FIRST OF ALL WE ARE IN A CRISIS THAT I DON'T RECALL HAVING DURING MY LIFETIME AND I'M A LITTLE OLDER PERHAPS BY TWICE AS MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM WE ARE EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC AND A HEALTH CRISIS- THE A PANDEMIC THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A HUNDRED YEARS WHICH IS OLDER THAN I. AND THESE CALLS FOR HELP OUR REAL THEIR IMMEDIATE THEY ARE JUSTIFIABLE WE CAN'T IGNORE THEM. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THOSE COMING UP SHORT IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PAY RENT RIGHT NOW ARE COMING UP SHORT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. AND WE HAVE A DUTY TO HELP. WITH EACH PROPOSAL FOR TENET RELIEF WE'VE HEARD HOWEVER WE'VE ALSO HEARD AN UNDERSTANDABLE RETORT FROM LANDLORDS WHAT ABOUT US WHAT ABOUT ME. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WE DON'T WANT TO KICK TENANTS OUT BUT WITHOUT RENT PAYMENTS WE CANNOT PAY MORTGAGES OR TAXES OR MAINTENANCE AND- OTHER KINDS OF THINGS UPON WHICH WE DEPEND. ON THAT RENTAL INCOME FOR AS WELL. WE HEARD IT AGAIN TODAY AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING IT THROUGHOUT. IT IS CLEARLY A LEGITIMATE CONCERN SO I GREATLY WELCOME AND SUPPORT THE OPPORTUNITY. TWO APPROACHES BILL WHICH I BELIEVE IS MORE BALANCED IT GIVES TENANTS TO BREAK IF THEY NEEDED IN A GIVE SMALL LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS A BREAK IF THEY NEED IT AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK THE MANY OF THOSE WHO WERE A TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION DID NOT REALIZE THAT THIS BILL INCLUDES BOTH THE TENANT. AND THE LANDLORD THE SMALLER LANDLORDS WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THEM TESTIFIED TODAY SO I WOULD ASK THAT THOSE WHO ARE STILL LISTENING WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANY HELP FOR THE LOOK FOR LANDLORDS SUPPORT FOR HOMEOWNERS PLEASE LISTEN CAREFULLY IT IS INDEED INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. AND OF COURSE NOT SURPRISINGLY THE NEXT LINK UP IN THE FINANCIAL CHAIN WHICH IS BANKS AND LENDERS NOW RAISE THEIR VOICE TO SAY DON'T MAKE US BEAR THE BURDEN OF HAVING TO WAIT TO GET PAID BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH THAT WE ALL I THINK HAVE TO CONFRONT NONE OF THIS WANTED THE SITUATION. NONE OF US ARE HAPPY WITH THE SITUATION BUT ALL OF US ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BEAR SOME PART OF THE BURDEN OTHERWISE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT IN THE STREET. WE ARE GOING TO SEE. HOMEOWNER AND SMALL LANDLORDS. FORECLOSED UPON. AND WHAT WOULD LIKELY HAPPEN THEN IT IS THOSE WHO HAVE HAD THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO WEATHER THE STORM. COULD VERY WELL BY UP ALL THOSE PROPERTIES. ENHANCE THEIR OWN FINANCIAL WEALTH. TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE AVERAGE PERSON. THE AVERAGE SMALL LANDLORD WHO FINDS THEMSELVES. TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING. THOSE ARE NOT OUR VALUES. AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY. EVERYONE INVOLVED FROM BANKS AND LENDERS. ARE AND THOSE WHO ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO STEP UP. AND ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO DO SO I BELIEVE MUCH TO HELP AS WELL. AND IF NOTHING ELSE UNLIKE LANDLORDS TENANTS AND HOMEOWNERS THE BANKS AND LENDERS. ARE SECURED CREDITORS. AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'VE GOT THE GREATEST ASSURANCE OF GETTING THE FULL BENEFIT OF THEIR BARGAIN. THEY'VE GOT THE PROPERTY. AS THEIR ASSURANCE. I RECOGNIZE THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LIMITS OF STATE AUTHORITY TO MANDATE FORBEARANCE AND IT WAS DISCUSSED AT LENGTH IN THIS BILL WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE INDEED SOME OF PREEMPTION ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED- THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS- AND WITH RESPECT TO FEDERALLY CHARTERED BANKS SO WE HAVE ENGAGED MYSELF AND MY STAFF IN VERY FRANK CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS AND- BY MERGING THE AUTHOR. OF THE AUTHORS TO CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL IS ON THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE LEGAL FOOTING. IT WOULD BE MY HOPE THAT THE BANKS AND THE LENDERS WOULD BE WILLING TO DO SOME FOR PARENTS BE WILLING TO BE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION RATHER THAN POTENTIALLY RUN INTO THE COURTS ARE- ASSERTING FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUES AND FRANKLY PART OF THIS DISCUSSION IS WE'VE TRIED TO CREATE SOME PARALLELS. SO THAT WHAT WAS DONE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE CARERS ACT WILL BE AVAILABLE- OVERALL TO OTHERS BUT- THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT BILL IT'S OF. DIFFICULT SITUATION- BUT THE THIS BILL AND IT'S CONCEPTS HAVE TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND PART OF THE SOLUTION SO. I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I DON'T USUALLY IT'S NOT BEEN MY PRACTICE TO. SUPPORT A BILL PRIOR TO OUR HEARING BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS WAS NOTED. IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE OPENING I AM HONORED TO BE. ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND AS THE PRINCIPLE COOPER FROM THE SENATE HAVING WORKED FOR HEART IN THIS BILL I KNOW IT FAIRLY WELL- WE NEED TO CONFRONT A POTENTIAL WAVE OF EVICTIONS AND FORECLOSURES ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. AND DOING NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION. CAN WE CLOSE. HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT SO- THE- TO THE LANDLORDS OPPOSING THE BILL BECAUSE YOU'VE NOT GOTTEN RENT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS WE HEAR YOU EVEN IF I DID CUT YOU OFF ABSOLUTELY IT'S A PROBLEM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT GOTTEN RENT WHICH THEY NEED TO MAKE THEIR PAYMENTS AND TO MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY. THIS IS A CRISIS FOR THEM AS WELL AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL ALSO GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO DEFER YOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AS WELL. AND IF YOU IF YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT IT IS IN THIS BILL AS IT HAS BEEN CRAFTED. YOU ARE GOING TO GET A FORBEARANCE AS WELL. THE BILL DOES NOT CANCEL ANYONE'S RENT. IT DOES NOT CANCEL MORTGAGES. AND I KNOW THERE IN THAT- ACTIVISTS OUT THERE DEMANDING THAT WE CANCEL THINGS BUT- I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. FOR SMALL LANDLORDS HOME MORE OWNERS AND TENANTS ALIKE THE BILL TEMPORARILY DEFERS THOSE PAYMENTS. BUT EVERYONE STILL HAS TO PAY THEM EVENTUALLY. COMMITTEE STAFF HAS WORKED REALLY HARD ON THIS AND- TO TRY TO IDENTIFY EVERY INCENTIVE REPAIR POSSIBLE AND URGE THAT TO THEIR LANDLORDS. IT IS PART OF THIS BILL THE AMENDMENTS ALSO MAKE CLEAR THAT UNDER THE BILL LANDLORDS CAN EVICT TENANTS FOR ANY LAWFUL REASON. ANY LAWFUL REASON WHETHER IT'S NUISANCE OR DAMAGING PROPERTY OR BREAKING MATERIAL TERM OF TE LEASE THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS THAT IF THE REASON FOR THE EVICTION. IS THAT THE TENANT HAS FALLEN BEHIND ON THE RENT DURING THIS CALL OF A DYING TEEN PANDEMIC THEN THE LANDLORD MUST GIVE THE TENANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEFERRED THOSE PAYMENTS BY SIGNING AN ATTESTATION THAT THE TENANT HAS A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN AND I WILL SAY WE'VE ALSO HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT ATTESTATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND THAT I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE THAT DISCUSSION. GOING FORWARD IN THIS BILL. BUT THE KEY TO NOTE. THAT THIS BILL PROTECTS HOMEOWNERS FROM LOSING THEIR HOMES TO FORECLOSURE AS WELL. NACHOS PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS AND SMALL LANDLORDS BUT FOR HOMEOWNERS AND THE LAST TIME WE HAD THIS IN THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THIS LEGISLATURE WAS CALLED UPON TO TRY TO CLEAN UP A MESS. THAT WAS CREATED BECAUSE OF ALL OF THOSE FORECLOSURES. WE ARE TRYING TO ACT PROACTIVELY IN THIS CASE TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING AND AS THE ANALYSIS DISCUSSES- THERE ARE. OF COMPONENT TO THIS BILL WE HAVE CREATED AN EXCEPTION FOR CREDIT UNIONS AND SMALL LENDERS- HOW FOR COMMUTE HUMANITY COMES TO BEAR TO MIND IS ONE THAT. THAT WE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZING DOES UNIQUE AND EXTRAORDINARY WORK IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT- AGAIN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IN OPPOSITION- THERE PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO. CONSIDER WHAT'S BEST AND WHAT IS FAIR FOR SMALL LANDLORDS I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE BANKS- AND IN THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE COME IN ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO IT THAT MY FRIENDS AT THE CHURCH COMMERCE TO VIEW SUCH. A MAKES NO SENSE TO ME BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT A WHAT'S YOUR PLAN. HOW ARE WE GOING TO PEOPLE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS CATASTROPHIC EVENT AS A RESULT OF THE CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT WE ARE IN NOW.AND SO- AGAIN- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT- THE AUTHORS HAVE DONE TO TRY TO ASSIST THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL- I WON'T GET INTO THAT IF OTHERS WANT TO DO THAT TO GETTING INTO THE WEEDS OF IT WE CERTAINLY COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION. BUT AGAIN THE SPIRIT OF THIS BILL IS TO BRING EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE REQUIRE EVERYBODY OF LITTLE SKIN IN THIS GAME NO ONE'S GONNA BENEFIT AND MAKE OUT LIKE A BANDIT IF YOU WILL AS A RESULT OF THIS PANDEMIC NO. BUT IT SHOULD. REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU LIVE. FIRST HERE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THERE SHOULD BE NOBODY WHO COMES OUT THE BETTER. FOR THE FACT THAT WE HAVE LOST. A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND LIVES IN THIS COUNTRY. AND ELEVEN THOUSAND HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO ME THAT WOULD BE NOT ONLY DISGRACEFUL. BUT A MORAL. AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. FROM THE BANKERS DOWN TO THE LITTLE THAT. WRECK WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS BUT IN THIS CALL NINETY CRIED. THIS IS A CHANNEL. THAT I BELIEVE THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR AND APPROPRIATE. THOSE ARE MY TWO CENTS PROBABLY TWENTY CENTS BUT I WILL GO WITH THE- SENATOR ABOARD SHIPS AND THEN FOR BY. RUSSELL. THANK YOU CHAIR. THAT SUITS. WE BEGIN THIS AT AM IT'S ALMOST THIRTY BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE ACTUAL SUB OF THE- THIS COULD BE A LAW NIGHT I THINK CENTER MY- SAID IT BEST. I THINK IT'S AN THAT WE IGNORE ALL THAT THERE WAS IN. IN THIS IDEA OUR THAT THIS LEGISLATION ALLOWS FOR ATTENTION TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS AND I'LL DEFINITELY GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR THAT I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS THAT I'VE HAD AT LEAST ON FLOOR VOTES. WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IS THAT HE WAS ONLY THE RENTER'S. AND THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF INTERRELATED ENTITIES HERE BETWEEN THE RENTERS. THE LANDLORDS THE CAPITAL MARKETS- IN EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE ARE POWERFUL IT OUT OVER THE WORLD. SO YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK UPON THEM BEEN SEGMENTED WAYS IT'S ALMOST IMPERATIVE THE YEP DO APPRECIATE. THE CONTINUUM OF INTERESTED PARTIES. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SOLVE A PROBLEM BY IGNORING THOSE OTHER PARTIES. IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO JUST KIND OF JUMP AROUND A LITTLE BIT FOR CLARITY ON AND ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES. SO. LET'S START WITH THE TENANT HARDSHIP I'M FROM LET'S LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE I THINK I HAVE A DECENT APPRECIATION OF WHAT IT IS I DON'T WHAT I DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND IS WHY WE'RE NOT HOLDING. OUR THE ATTESTATION IN THE DEMONSTRATION OF HARDSHIP TO A HIGHER LEVEL. FROM WHAT I READ THAT THERE IS SIMPLY A REPRESENTATION THAT I SUFFER HARDSHIP- 10% OR WHATEVER IT IS. A DECREASE IN- IN INCOME THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT. SO ONE THING I WOULD WANT AND MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT ON. IS WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO MAKE IT A FORMAL ATTESTATION UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. AND ALSO A COMPANY THAT TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WITH SOME SORT OF REPRESENTATION SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL REPRESENTATION. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK IT IT IT ASKS FOR THAT. IF YOU SAID THAT HAS IMPACTED MINE MINE ECONOMICS AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT WHICH IS A REASONABLE OR FAIR AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THAT MEAN MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT WHY. WASN'T THAT ELEVATE. SURE HAPPY TO THAT LET ME FIRST JUST START BY SAYING THE ORIGINAL VERSION THE BILL ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE ATTESTATION LANGUAGE AND THE RATIONALE FOR THAT WAS WE KNOW THAT ALL TENANTS ARE STRUGGLING AND THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD. REQUIRE ANYTHING GIVEN THE SITUATION WOULD BE CHALLENGING BUT- AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHAIR AND OTHERS- WE MOVE FORWARD IN ANTICIPATION REQUIREMENT AGAIN FOR THE VERY POINT OF WE WANT TO OBVIOUSLY FOCUSES ON PEOPLE HAVE NEEDS. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THAT UNDER PENATY OF PERJURY IT IS NOT CURRENTLY- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IF I MIGHT JUST INTERRUPT HIM PART OF THE REASON IT ISN'T IS IT IT'S MODELED AFTER ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL VERSION. CURRENTLY NOW UNDER THE FEDERAL VERSION INDIA THANK BE SIMPLE AT. AND DOES REQUIRE ANYTHING MORE SO THAT WE IT WAS MODEL YOU MODELED IT AFTER WHAT IS THE CURRENT FEDERAL ATTESTATION SO I THINK THAT PUTS IT A LITTLE BIT IN CONTEXT BUT THE QUESTION SALUTE IS A VALID POINT I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT A IS ACTUALLY SO- MANAGER- HAD MENTIONED. ONE KEY POINT WHICH IS WHICH IS WHAT SHE JUST SAID ANOTHER CHALLENGE HAS BEEN- THEIR UGGESTION THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS THAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED YOU SHOW A BANK STATEMENT YOU SHOW- SOME EMPLOYER. AND WE. KNOW THAT THERE ARE SO MANY TENANTS WHO. CAN WHERE THE- FRANKLY JUST IN PA TO GET. SO IF YOU WORK FOR. A SMALL THAT HAS GONE ON AND YOU CAN EVEN FOR YOUR BOSS. IF YOU UNDOCUMENTED YOU'RE GETTING PAID- IN IN TO THROUGH THROUGH DIFFERENT MONEY ECONOMIES IF YOU'RE ON BANKS AND YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BANKING STATEMENT SO. THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW- YOU NEED TO PROVE WITH DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU HAVE SUFFERED- AND ECONOMIC IT IS IT'S JUST FRANKLY CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT. SO THIS CONVERSATION HAS NOT BEEN SIMPLE BUT I WILL SAY. IT IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION- AND- WE ARE CERTAINLY IN FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY DISTRICT THE BALANCE BECAUSE I THINK WE WANT TO ENSURE IS. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED THIS HELP SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT. WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE SUCH A DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT TO DETERMINE THAT- WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO SCARE FOLKS OFF WHO- MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO AN ATTORNEY AND I SHOULD. MENTION IN THIS CONTEXT. TYPICALLY IN LANDLORD TENANT THE LANDLORD TENANT. LAWSUITS. LANDLORDS ARE REPRESENTED NINETY PER OF THE TIME. TENANTS WERE LESS THAN THAT WERE. A YOU PENALTY APPROACH FOR SOMEONE COULD BE PROSECUTOR HAS A CHILLING OF AND IF THEIR DOCTOR REQUIREMENTS A TOUCH THAT THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD SO THAT'S WHY THIS ISSUE IS COMPLICATED BUT YOUR BEGINNER TO MY EARLIER POINT WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH THIS AND- AND I SUSPECT THEY'LL BE MORE CONVERSATIONS AGAIN I AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT I THINK. THERE ARE SOME UNDERLYING REALITIES WHERE THAT WOULD POSE A DIFFICULTY- I THINK ULTIMATELY HOWEVER. TO BE FAIR. THERE NEEDS TO BE A SERIOUS- REASSESSMENT ON THE DOCUMENTATION AND ATTESTATION- TO MAKE THAT BETTER LIMIT A LIMIT LET ME MOVE ON. THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCIES INCLUDES BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES SO THAT. IS THAT CORRECT THAT WITH THIS HE ACTUALLY I TRY TO LEAVE ALSO WITH THE CHAIRS SPA SUGGESTION WE TOOK OUT THE LOCAL EMERGENCIES PIECE IN AT THIS POINT SO WHAT. WE DID START WITH THE DRAFT STATE AND LOCAL I BELIEVE AT THIS POINT WE'VE TAKEN OUT THE LOCAL THIS IS THE CHALLENGE OF THEIR TRUNCATED TO LEGISLATIVE ACCOUNT. OR HAVING GOTTEN IT THIS MORNING. IN ON THIS IS GONE THROUGH QUITE A FEW AND THEN. THAT ARE THAT ARE AND ALL ALL GO IN MOVE ON. FOR THOSE FOR THOSE LOAN THAT HAVE BEEN PACKAGED BEHIND THEM THIS WERE HERE THE CORPORATE LARGER ENTITIES- THE INVESTMENT TRUSTS THIS IS WHERE I HEAR THEIR ANGST ON THIS. IS THAT IF YOU TAKE AWAY ON THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE RENTERS IN CAN FOR THE SMALL- MOM AND POP. A MULTI FAMILY UNITS. THERE'S A MASSIVE SEGMENT OF THE INDUSTRY THAT INCLUDES THE CORPORATE ENTITIES THE INVESTMENT TRUSTS VENTURE CAPITALIST SO ON AND SO FORTH. THESE INDIVIDUALS. ARE GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK RIGHT SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. IF THE DAY ARE PUBLICLY TRADED FOR THAT. FIFTY M. LOANS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN PACKAGE PORTFOLIO IN FLOATED ON THE MARKET EITHER DOMESTICALLY OVERSEAS. HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT DO WE KNOW. YES BUT AS OUR ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE CHAIRED SUDAN'S. THE BILL IS FOCUSED ON MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE FOR AN UNDER UNITS SO IT REALLY DEPENDS I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT A CORPORATION THAT BIG WOULD ONLY HAVE FOUR. UNITS AND THIS BILL DOES NOT SOLVE FOR ANYONE WHO HAD MORE THAN FOUR UNITS IN TERMS OF FOR EXACTLY THAT. THIS MIGHT IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ENVISIONED. AS OUTLINED IN THE LEGISLATION. AND I KIND OF GO BACK TO THE CONTINUUM. OF INTERESTED PARTIES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY ITSELF I DON'T KNOW IF ANY FINAL THOUGHTS ON WE'RE LEAVING OUT LARGER ENTITIES MEDIUM TO LARGER AND EVEN INTERNATIONAL ENTITIES FROM THIS- THE BILL ITSELF ON THE MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE SIDE IT'S FOCUSED ON. THE AREAS FOCUSED ON SMALLER LANDLORDS- AS OPPOSED TO THE CORPORATE ONES OR BIGGER ONES- AND IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY- IT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WHERE IS THE GREATEST NEED I THINK THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE. PACKAGE IN THE ENTIRE BILL IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAD IT FOR EVERYBODY NOT EVERYONE BENEFITS FROM THIS BILL BUT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS FOR THE GREATEST FINANCIAL NEED CAN BE AND SO WE FOCUSED ON THE SMALL. LANDLORDS AND TENANTS ALL RIGHT SO HERE AND I'LL FINISH UP WITH A LOT OF LAST POINTS THAT HAVE CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WE'VE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH. WHAT THE MARKET IS. THE HOUSING DIFFICULTIES THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE STATE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES SOME HAVE. REFERENCE FOR RENT CONTROL SOME HAVE FREE MARKET SO ON AND SO FORTH. BUT SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED THAT THIS FORBEARANCE PROCESS ULTIMATELY WILL BE BORNE BY THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE THIS WILL DIS INCENTIVIZE. THE FLOW OF CAPITAL. ONE IT WOULD DISINCENTIVE EYES THE FLOW OF CAPITAL A NUMBER TWO FOR THOSE ENTITIES WISHING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR MULTI FAMILY UNITS AT A LARGER SCALE. THE RATIO OF ELIGIBILITY. FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS SEEKING A LOAN THEY MIGHT BE CAPPED OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE LOOKING AT TWENTY FIVE OR 50% DOWN ON THESE CAPITAL. INVESTMENTS LENDING INSTITUTIONS MIGHT ACTUALLY YANKED OUT ALL THE WAY UP 275% OR WHATEVER THAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR ARE WE NOT CONCERNED THAT WE'RE SOLVING A SHORT TERM ISSUE POSSIBLY A MEDIUM BUT CREATING SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM HOUSING PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA. TO ALL ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN A IN A FEW WAYS SO- I THINK THE PARENTS OR IS IT MAY HAVE SOME IMPACT ON THOSE CREDIT MARKETS BUT THE CHOICES WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US ARE STARK. THE CHOICES ARE DO WE WANT TO SEE A WAVE OF MASS EVICTIONS. WHICH LEAD TO A WAVE OF MASS FORECLOSURES. WHICH WOULD DESTROY THE ECONOMY. OR DO WE WANT. ASK FOR EVERYONE TO TAKE A PAUSE FOR SAY SIX OR TWELVE MONTHS. IN ORDER FOR RENTERS TO GET ABOUT BACK ON THEIR FEET. TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK. THEIR LANDLORDS WHO CAN THEN TURN AROUND AND PAY BACK. THE MORTGAGE HOLDER AND STABILIZE THE MARKET. I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT THE IDEA THAT WE ARE GOING TO AFFECT. A GENERATION OF RENTERS. AND THEN HAVE A WAVE OF FORECLOSURES WOULD BE FAR MORE CATASTROPHIC TO THE ECONOMY THAT WE'RE PROPOSING RIGHT NOW- BUT I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST- YOU KNOW LISTEN I THINK. FOR ALL OF US THE IDEAL SOLUTION WOULD BE IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. COULD INVEST MONEY- AND HELP STABILIZE THE ECONOMY THAT WE CAN STOCKLEY THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I THINK. YOU NEED TO GO IF WE'RE IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. THE STATE HAS TO PLAY A ROLE. AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED POLITICALLY IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY LIABILITIES IN SO MANY UNCERTAINTIES RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA THAT THE ROLE THAT CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY THE TAXPAYERS CAN PLAY IN CREATING A FUND. TO HELP THAT CONTINUE IN THAT I KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT. WOULD PROBABLY BE POLITICALLY UNPALATABLE SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THAT WERE USING THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE STATE. IN INTERFERING IN PRIVATE CONTRACTUAL SITUATIONS BASED ON A NEED. BUT WE HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD OF THIS OF ANY REAL SIGNIFICANT OP LOOK INVESTMENT INTO A STATE LOAN FOR SOME SORT OF ECONOMIC HOUSING FUND FROM WHICH INDIVIDUALS COULD DRAW. IN IN CREATE THAT BUT I MEAN IT'S A HERE'S MY LAST BUT IF I COULD JUST RESPONDED THAT WOULD HELP OUT A LITTLE LET HIM RESPOND I THINK THERE'S ONE THING HE SAID ABOUT THAT OBVIOUSLY THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN HERE IS IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD ASSIST US. STATE TO BUY THE TO GET WE DON'T GET THE PRINT MONEY THAT SPRINT PROPHECY WE CAN'T WE CAN'T PRINT MONEY. AND WE JUST SAW FOR FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT SO THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE MANY PENNIES UNDER THE COUCH THAT WE CAN PUT TOGETHER THE PIECES IT'S CHALLENGING- THE WASHINGTON. NOT ACTED. WE HAVE A TWO WEEK CLOCK TICK WE COULD SEE. LITERALLY NO OF TENANTS INTO WHO COULD FACE OF X. NOTICES WE HAVE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IF THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO IT I AM ALL EARS BUT I THINK UNTIL. ANYONE ELSE TELLS US THAT THEY'RE GONNA COME TO THE RESCUE WITH A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'VE GOT TO SOLVE THIS FOR OURSELVES AND THIS IS THE BEST IDEA WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH RIGHT NOW AND I CAN APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT- MY FINAL CONCERN. IS THAT. THIS WILL. ALMOST CERTAINLY BRING ABOUT LITIGATION. ARMY AND I'VE I WOULD HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. YOU KNOW CONSTITUTIONALITY. THE FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUE SOMEONE AND SO FORTH. THE REASON I BRING UP THOSE LIKE THOSE. LEGAL LIABILITIES IS ONLY BECAUSE IT MAY STALL OUT. THIS PROCESS SO WE HAVE TO ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT A PLAN B. IN THE EVENTUALITY THAT THIS IDEA DOESN'T WORK BUT MY LAST QUESTION IS CREDIT WORTHINESS SO I BELIEVE IN THE LEGISLATION. CREDIT RATING AGENCIES CANNOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- THIS PERIOD OF TIME DURING FORBEARANCE. BUT RENTS ARE STILL GOING TO BE DO NOW LET'S BE REALISTIC SOMEONE AS A WHOLE YEAR'S WORTH OF RENT THAT IS DUE- CHANCES ARE. A LOT THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET PAID BACK WANTS COME DUE. OR THEY ARE GOING TO FAIL TO RENEGOTIATE UNDER NEW TERMS- AS IT HAPPENS WILL THEN THE CREDIT. RATING OF PROCESS KICK IN AT THAT POINT WHEN THE YEARS OF POP. THAT THEY CAN THEN. BOTHERED THEIR CREDIT CAN BE REEVALUATED IN TARNISHED FOR LACK OF PAYMENT. EITHER FOR THE AT THE RENTAL LEVEL OR AT THE MORTGAGE LEVEL. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND PROCESS QUESTION LET ME JUST EXPLAIN WHAT THE BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO DO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THIS BILL IS SET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME DURING THIS CALL THAT EMERGED IN ORDER TO DO THE QUESTIONS REALLY CLEARS. WINDOWS THE CREDIT AGENCY REVIEW. KICK BACK IN. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T ABSOLVE A POPULATION LIKE THIS THAT RELIES ON CREDIT. THROUGH THE YOU KNOW THROUGH ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF COMMERCE HE HAS TO KICK BACK IN AT SOME POINT TO A CREDIT RATING REVIEW OF A BORROWER OF LENDERS OR BORROWER RENTER SILENCE OVER WIN WELL THAT KICK BACK IN AGREED SO WE SO WHAT THIS BILL IS SAYING IS THAT DURING THIS CALL THAT EMERGE TYPE HEARD HOW IT DEFINED LET'S SAY. FOR DEFINITE OF THIS ITS THIRD MONTHS OF. BE IT WAS NOT THE FOR. OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HIM OR HER BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE PANDEMIC IN THE SHUTDOWN ORDER IN THE JOBS IN MY OF LOSS IN INCOME THEY MAY HAVE NOT SEEN WE DON'T WANT THAT TO BE A PERMANENT THING ON THE RECORD THAT FOLLOWS HIM FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS THAT IMPACTS MANY ASPETS OF THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT. ACCESS FUTURE MORTGAGES ECCENTRICITY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME WE WANT TO NOT HAVE THAT IMPACT THEIR CREDIT RATING BUT SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE REPORT AND AN EARLY THEREAFTER IT CREDIT RATING REVIEW WILL BE ACTIVATED YES. AND INTO YOUR POINT I WOULD STILL BE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT SITUATION BUT I WOULD SUSPECT THAT YOU YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE AT SOME POINT YOUR CREDIT HAS TO BECOME YOUR CREDIT- ONCE WE GET THROUGH THIS AND ALL WE'RE SAYING IS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD OF COVER VERSIONS WE SHOULD. BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE CREDIT DINGS ARE NOT THEIR FAULT THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THAT THAT WAS. QUESTIONS THE FOR BEAR. IN THIS BILL IS ONLY OF. ON EGGS. LAW SO IT SHOULDN'T FEW LOAN TO IS CLEAR THAT THE IS THE- THERE'S ONE OTHER THING I. WANTED TO ADD YOU. THIS BILL IN MORE JUST ONE FOUR. SO FROM ONE TO FOUR HOURS YOU COULD RECEIVE UP TO TWELVE MONTHS OF FORBEARANCE COMPARABLE TO- TO COMPARABLE TO- WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH FEDERAL CARES ACT. BUT FOR- UNITS A FIVE OR MORE YOU WOULD STILL BE AVAILABLE FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS WHICH WAS ALSO PARALLEL TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THE AND THE CREDIT JUST CAN'T BE DOING BASED ON FAILURE TO DURING. THE COVER PERIOD WHAT WE AT HI GOOD. SO NEXT WE HAVE US DO RUSSIA THANK YOU FOR THAT DISCUSSION. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANNA THANK THE BILL OF THE ALL OF THIS BILL TOM THIS IS ALL HAVE SO AND THERE'S SO MANYTHAT WERE JUGGLING TO TRY TO ADDRESS TO TRY TO FIX TO TRY TO PREVENT- NO FOR FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE IMPACTED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WITH EITHER THE HEALTH ISSUES OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES OR- THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES SO I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO CALLED IN TO LEND THEIR SUPPORT- IT TOOK SEVERAL HOURS BUT- IT WAS WELL WORTH IT TO HEAR ABOUT THIS- AND IT JUST REINFORCES ALL WHAT IS GOING ON IN MY OWN DISTRICT. WHICH IS A WITHOUT A DOUBT- THE RENTAL AND THE MORTGAGES- ARE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT NUMBER ONE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. WE EVEN THOUGH THE MAJORITY OF HURDLES EVEN THOUGH THE MAJORITY OF RESIDENTS IN MY DISTRICT- 77% ARE RENTERS AND THAT'S THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF RENTERS IN THE WHOLE STATE. BUT I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE RENTERS FOREVER AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE RENTS FOR OVER THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO BUY. AND BUILD WEALTH AND BUILD BUILD EQUITY BUT SO MUCH IS AT STAKE FOR THEM THAT RIGHT NOW THE ONLY THING THAT THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT DRAMATICALLY FREEDOM IS HOW TO STAY IN A SAFE AND SAFE SHELTER- I JUST READING THIS ARTICLE FIGHT. CAN MANAGER- THE CAME OUT AND CALMATTERS- AND WE ARE I THINK WE WERE ALL WORKING UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE WAS SOME LEVEL OF. OF A ANY FICTION MORATORIUM FUNCTIONING OUT THERE BUT IT SHOWS THAT N A MATTER OF A FEW MONTHS STATEWIDE. JUST WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DOCUMENT WAS SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS WERE EVICTED. SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS UNDER UNDER SOME VERSION OF A NEED OF AN TO BE FICTION MORATORIUM. AND THAT DIDN'T COUNT FOURTEEN COUNTIES IT DIDN'T REPLY TO THEIR SURVEY. INCLUDING LA. SO UP ALREADY EVEN UNDER AGAIN SOME VERSION. OF PROTECTION FOR TENANTS. YOU KNOW CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND FAMILIES HAVE BEEN EVICTED. EACH ONE OF THOSE FAMILIES THE TROM THAT IS CAUSING ON THEM TO LOSE A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE AND IS SOMETHING THAT- I'M GLAD YOUR BILL ADDRESSES. AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE COULD DO WITH YOUR BILL TO MAKE IT. BIGGER AND BETTER AND OF FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO WERE IN FEAR BUT- YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW YOU DOING SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIANS NEED. RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING TO HELP HELP I DON'T KNOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MAYBE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. BUT IT'S BETTER TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING RIGHT NOW GIVE SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER. ABSOLUTE CHAOS WHICH IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU SAID IN A MATTER OF WEEKS SO I AM. I REALLY THINK THAT THE EVEN THOUGH. WE ARE GOING TO BE FACING AND THOSE FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE FACING A SOMETHING IN A YEAR OR SO. AS FAR AS- RENTS OR MORTGAGES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT UP- AND THAT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER CRISIS WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS. BUT IN IN THE MEANWHILE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME OF A SENSE OF ORDER SOME SENSE. PROTECTION FOR BOTH. OF ALL. AS WELL AS OUR RENTERS SO I WANNA. SHOW MY ABSOLUTE SUPPORT AND I HOPE THAT THEY'LL BE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO WHICH IS- EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WHICH IS. THESE WRENCHES AND- HOMEOWNERS WILL NOT HAVE TO COME UP WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. IN DEBT. AT THE END OF ONE YEAR OR SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A SENATOR MORNING WHITE HOUSE KEY STERN AND WILK. GONZALEZ AND- LET SENATOR MELENDEZ TO THE GROUP PART LET'S GO UP. TO SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS TOM. FOR ADVANCING THIS SIN THE COMMITTEE IN THE CHAIR FOR HELPING TO. FURTHER AN EXPERT. THEM THOSE WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE COVERAGE CONTEMPLATED HERE. AGAIN I THINK THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THIS IN HIS OPENING BUT THAT WAS THIS MORNING FROM THE CONTEXT OF THIS CRISIS IS UNPRECEDENTED WE'VE HAD OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS DONE. OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND. AMERICANS HAVE DIED. THE SCOPE OF THIS WE'VE BECOME ALMOST NUMB TO THE REALITY- IF THIS HAPPENED IN WAR THE NUMBERS WOULD BE HUGE IF THIS HAPPENED IN ANY OTHER FORM OF NATURAL DISASTER THIS WOULD BE HUGE. THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCE HAS RESULTED IN. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS LOSING JOBS. AND NOW THE E. D. D. SUPPORT THE FEDERAL SUPPORT IS EXHAUSTED AND HAS NOT BEEN RENEWED SO PEOPLE WHO HAD SOME COMBINATION OF EDT MONEY FROM THE STATE AND FEDERAL CARES ACT MONEY AND THE- UNEMPLOYMENT SUPPLEMENT IT'S ALL GONE. SO THE NEXT STEP IF YOU'RE HELD TO PAY YOUR RENT. AS A FAMILY. AND YOU FACE EVICTION. YOU FACE HOMELESSNESS. SO THEN ARM AGENCY SERVICES WILL HAVE TO CONSTRUCT TENT CITIES. REFUGEE CENTERS. TAKEOVER SCHOOL GYMS THE HOUSE. THOSE THAT WERE UNABLE TO PAY RENT. THIS BILL PROVIDES TEMPORARY EMERGENCY RELIEF NOT JUST FOR TENANTS BUT ALSO FOR HOMEOWNERS FOR SMALL LANDLORDS- AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO TRY TO DEFINE AND EXPAND. AND I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THERE ARE SOME WHO WON'T ENJOY THE PROTECTION LARGE CORPORATIONS INVESTMENT FUNDS THEY ARE PERHAPS A BETTER POSITION TO GET SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WAS SHOWN IN THE ONE AND ONLY CARES ACT WHERE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WENT TO BANKING INSTITUTIONS. AND CHECKS FOR ONE CHECK FOR TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. CAME TO POOR WORKING PEOPLE SO THAT'S ALL BY WAY OF KIND OF BACKGROUND OF THE GRAVITY OF THE CRISIS SO MY QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AUTHORS. MOM IS. THE RELIEF THAT'S PROVIDED IS TEMPORARY IT'S A PERIOD OF MONTHS. IN WITH THE EXPECTATION AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT ANY RENT OWED. OR PAYMENTS OWED WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BE PAID TO THE LANDLORD TO THE BANKING INSTITUTION. IT SETRA. HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO. HOW PEOPLE THAT MAY BENEFIT TEMPORARILY ARE SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY IF THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY EARNING. IF THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY. RECEIVING ANY FEDERAL RELIEF. ARE WE JUST POSTPONING WHAT'S GONNA BE. THE NEXT CRISIS AND DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW WE MITIGATE THAT HIT SOME AFTER IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW AND RUNS ITS COURSE. HOW DO WE PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST THAT CLIFF. SO THE QUICK ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS I DO HAVE CONCERNS AT THIS BILL MAY NOT BE ENOUGH EVEN IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED IN ITS FULL FORM WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE GIVE PEOPLE PERIOD OF TIME- FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS TO NOT BE EVICTED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY PAY THE RENT AND WE GIVE THEM ANOTHER PERIOD OF TIME. TO HOPEFULLY EARN MONEY- TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK THE RENT AND THEN AT SOME POINT SOON ALL THAT THAT IS GOING TO COME OUT AND LANDLORDS CAN GO AFTER THOSE TENANTS FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE RENT I DO WANT TO SAY I KNOW. THE ARE THANK THE CALIFORNIA PART ASSOCIATION I REFERRED TO THIS BILLS ARE. STRIKE BILL AND COMMUNICATE TO ITS MEMBERS AND I THINK THAT CONFUSED A LOT OF MEMBERS. WHO ARE COMMUNICATING TODAY BUT THAT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT TRUE. YOU CAN'T CAMP HERE TO STRIKE. IF UNDER THIS BILL WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THE TENNIS WILL ALL THE RENT. ARE TO YOUR POINT. OF THE WEEK IF THE COVERT PANT. AND THE RISK. DEEPENS WE COULD. QUITE CHALLENGE BUT MY SUGGESTION HERE IS WE'RE TRYING TO GET IT DOWN THE MIDDLE. TO GIVE A CHANCE FOR. AT LEAST THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS CERTAINLY WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE IS NOT IN SESSION UNTIL NEXT YEAR- FOR US TO NOT SEE A WAVE OF ACTIONS AND HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT- YOU KNOW. WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE AND OTHER SOLUTIONS. I ALSO YOU KNOW WANT TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT UNDERSTAND THAT IN KNOW AS WE LOOK. TO BEFORE. IF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T COME TO OUR RESCUE WE MAY NEED TO THINK ABOUT OTHER SOURCES OF RUNNING. I KNOW THERE'S A SUGGESTION OF POTENTIALLY TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OF STATE GOVERNMENT TAX CREDITS. TO BENEFIT LANDLORDS- THE WHICH IS A BILL THAT. THIS BODY CONSIDERED AND I WANT TO SAY THAT. I VOTED IN SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN TENS APPROACH. AS POTENTIALLY COMPLEMENTARY TO WHAT WE'RE DOING. BUT AGAIN WITH A FIFTY FOUR BILLION BUDGET DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT. IT'S UNCERTAIN WHETHER WE AS A STATE. WOULD BE ABLE TO. WITHSTAND THAT FINANCIAL HIT. SO AGAIN LOOKING FOR IDEAS- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR POINT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE MAY BRING AND IF THE FUTURE CONTINUES POORLY WE COULD CONTINUE TO BE IN TROUBLE BUT IF WE DON'T DO THIS. YOU KNOW IN TWO WEEKS WILL. IN DEEP DEEP CRISIS AND I. THAT IN. THE GRAVITY OF THE EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW REQUIRES. EMERGENCY ACTION WHICH TO ME THIS BILL REPRESENTS. A BUT I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE. TO CONTINUE TO POINT OUT THE NEED FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. THE NEED FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TO PURSUE A SPIRIT OF COOPERATION MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND MUTUAL SUPPORT- A SPECIFIC QUESTION IF APPROVING A RENTER FAMILY. CAN'T PAY THE FULL RENT. ARE THE DOES THIS BILL STILL ALLOW THEM TO NEGOTIATE A PHONE LANDLORDS WILLING TO TAKE LESS THAN FULL RENT FROM THIS BILL WOULD NOT PROHIBIT THAT AGREEMENT BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT. ABSOLUTELY NOT AND IN FACT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL WAS ACTUALLY A POLICY VALUE THAT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE- WANTED TO SEE HIM BETTER THAN THIS BILL SO WE VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY RENEGOTIATIONS OF THE RENT BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. THANK YOU IN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE SOMETHING THAT. THE CHAIR SAID TO MANY WHO CALLED IN OPPOSITION I HOPE YOU DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE BILL AS AMENDED. AND TO SEE THE RELIEF OFFERED NOT JUST TO TENANTS. BUT TO SMALL LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS. AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU MIGHT FIT AS A BENEFICIARY. IN THAT CONTINUUM OR SPECTRUM OF SUPPORT THAT'S OFFERED BY THIS BILL. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS IN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY CERTAINLY BEFORE WE GET TO THE NEXT BAKER I WAS POSED TO ME AND I'D LIKE TO SHE GOT AN ANSWER. FROM YOU ARE THE ONE TO FOUR UNITS IS AN AGGREGATE SO IF SOMEONE HAS THREE FOUR YEAR UNIT APARTMENT STATE DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THIS OR DO THAT. FOR THE MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE YES. IF YOU HAVE ONE TO THREE. NO IF THEY HAVE THREE FOUR UNIT PROPERTIES OR THREE THREE UNIT PROPERTY SYSTEM. BASIS IT'S ON A UNIT BASIS AT THIS MOMENT SO THE ANSWER IS NO AT THIS TIME PLEASE OPEN A P. OR THE AGGREGATE YOU MUST HAVE LESS THAN FOUR UNITS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR OR LESS. FOR THE FORBEARANCE. FOR A YEAR FOR TWELVE MONTHS. CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT SO IT'S A TOTAL IT'S TOTAL SO IF SOMEONE HAS FIVE UNITS. THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE. FOR TWELVE MONTHS. THEY COULD GET SIX MONTHS. THANKS THANK YOU MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT FOR TRYING TO. NO NO I CAN I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT WE HAVEN'T HAD A FEE FOR THIS BILL HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REFOCUSED. AN EXPANDED TO TRY TO INCLUDE EVERYBODY EVEN THE BANKS- TO THE EXTENT THEY'RE WILLING TO PLAY BALL. BUSTLED IT'S WORTH THE DISCUSS AND PERHAPS A CENTER MELINDA'S IF YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS YOU'D LIKE TO ASK. WHERE DO WE GO TO YOU YOUR EAGER TO PARTICIPATE IF YOU. BUT IN THE IT WAS MY TURN YET BUT I'M HAPPY TO WELL I WOULD I WAS THINKING THAT WE JUST- IF YOU'D RATHER DIFFERENT WEIGHT IF YOU'D RATHER AIT TILL LATER THAT'S FINE. YOU KNOW IT'S FINE I JUST IN ONE JUMP AHEAD OF ANYONE I DON'T KNOW THAT'S RIGHT THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO WAIT PATIENTLY BECAUSE I'M STILL THE CHAIR. ALL RIGHTY THEN. PUT THANK YOU MAY. CHAIR SO. ASSEMBLY MEN'S. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I'M JUST NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK FOR- THE HOME OWNER WHO'S RENTING OUT THEIR PROPERTY. IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT A HOMEOWNER. WHO WHO RENTS OUT A PROPERTY CAN GET A FORBEARANCE- SO THAT'S A TEMPORARY RELIEF FROM PAYING THE MORTGAGE GREAT EXCEPT THAT WHEN THAT FORBEARANCE ENDS. THAT PROPERTY OWNER DAN MUST PAY IN FULL THE AMOUNT THAT IS OWED SO IF YOU'RE GOING IF YOU WERE. TENANTS ISN'T PAYING RENT FOR A YEAR AND THE BANK GIVES YOU FORBEARANCE FOR A YEAR. AT THE END OF THE YEAR DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S REALISTIC TO ASSUME THAT A RENTER IS GOING TO COME UP WITH A YEAR'S WORTH OF RENT. IF THEY COULDN'T PAY IT. THAT WHOLE YEAR. WHY. WHY WOULD WE THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE MONEY AFTER YEAR TO PAY IN FULL AGAIN THE STRUCTURE THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY SAYS WE WANNA GIVE TENANTS A YEAR TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET TO HOPEFULLY EARN THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK THE LANDLORD. AND AT THAT POINT. HOPEFULLY THE TEN AND IS ABLE TO PAY THE LANDLORDS ARE THE LANDLORD CAN PAY THE MORTGAGE. YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE AGAIN WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN THE END OF YOUR BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS IF WE START AFFECTING FOLKS. OVER IF WE TELL THEM THAT ALL THE RENT IS DUE. NEXT MONTH. WE KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE. IT WAS TENANTS THOSE TENANTS WILL BE HOME OWNER IS GOING TO BE TOLD. ALL THE MORTGAGE IS DUE AT THE END OF TWELVE MONTHS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH THAT. WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GET IT. IN PLACE. BUT THIS BUT THIS BILL IN A MINUTE BUT SOME OF THE- THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN REMEMBER THEY WERE SAYING. I JUST OWN WE ARE ONE RENTAL PROPERTY NINE DEPEND ON THAT. FOR MY INCOME BECAUSE I'M RETIRED OR YOU KNOW WHAT HAVE YOU. WHAT DO THEY DO. A LET'S HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONLY KNOWN ANSWER THAT BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH THE FORBEARANCE PART PERHAPS YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR US. THANK YOU. SO THAT YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN'T TELL. A BANK HOW TO STRUCTURE THEIR PAYMENTS. HOWEVER UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW SO THIS IS A LINE WITH CARES ACT. SERVICES CANNOT. UP SOME PREPAYMENT. AND IN THIS. WHAT IT ALSO DOES IT SAYS THAT IF A LUMP SUM. YOUR TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THE RENT FOR SIX ALL OF THE TARGET. FOR SIX MONTHS. AT THE VERY END. THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCLOSED UP FOR. BEFORE SOMEONE GOES INTO THE FOR PRINCE PROCESS. STILL THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE ONE. IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE CURES ACT AND THIS BILL IS A LINE THAT. SECOND THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT. EXPLICITLY BE SET UP FRONT. TO THE BACK COULD BE PART OF THE DECISION MAKING FOR THE- HOMEOWNER LANDLORD. BEFORE I GO INTO FOR POPS. OKAY JUST COMPETE ME BECAUSE YOU JUST SAID. THEY'RE NOT A- TO SAY YOU HAVE TO PAY EVERY ALL AT. A FRONT. BUT THEY ALSO TO DISCLOSE THAT. THE GOING TO DO THAT. WE CAN'T TELL STATE ACCOUNT. CANNOT TELL ABOUT HOW STRUCK. PAYMENTS SO WE CAN'T BUT STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUS FEDERAL. UNDER THE CARE ACT DID AND SAID. IF YOU CAN'T DO LAW SUM. WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT SO WE CAN'T DO THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY SAID THAT YOU CAN'T TO LUMP SUMS. BUT IT DEFINITELY ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANTED TO DO SO THAT THIS WASN'T A QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION. WAS MAKE SURE THAT THE BANK INTERCOM. WOULD DISCLOSE THEIR PAYMENT BECAUSE WE CAN'T THE STATE CALIFORNIA CAN'T TELL BANKS HOW TO RESTRUCTURE THOSE PAYMENTS. BUT OKAY SO WE UNDERSTAND THOUGH THAT THE BANKS. ARE GOING TO WANT TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK RIGHT SO. DON'T YOU THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY HOW THEY WOULD STRUCTURE THAT SORT OF IF STATEMENTS ARE A FEDERALLY BACKED LOAN AT THE MOMENT THEY CANNOT DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE CARES ACT SPECIFIES OKAY SO NOW IF THEY'RE NON FEDERALLY. BACKED LOAN WHICH WE HAD MAYBE THIRTY PLUS PERCENTAGE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT FEDERALLY BANK WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO IS TO DISCLOSE IT UP FRONT. WE'RE BASICALLY PARALLELING THE CARERS ACT WITH THESE BANKS FEDERALLY BACKED YES FOR FEDERALLY BACKED UP FOR STATE BACKED LOANS WE CAN DO BETTER. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO JUST TO BE BETTER IT'S REALLY CHEST GIVE CONSUMERS THAT ADVANCE NOTICE. THE GONNA HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AND WE AS A STATE BECAUSE OF OUR CONCERN ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION WILL ALSO GIVE THEM NOTICE WOULD LIKE THE FEDS TO DO IT TOO BUT WE KNOW WE CAN'T ORDER THEM. SO FOR THAT FOR THIS FOR THE STATE BACKED LOANS THE STATE CAN SAY- YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK FOR ALL THE MONEY UP FRONT OR YOU MUST ASK FOR IT ALL AT FOR A DIMINISHING DO ANYTHING WE WANT CORRECT FOR THE STATE BACKED LOANS. NOT NECESSARILY THE STATE I MEAN THIS IS IT THIS IS AN ASPECT WHERE NO STATE- THESE ARE PRIVATELY BANKS BANK MONTHLY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT STATE BACKED LOANS- AND SO WE CAN'T TELL THEM. HOW MUCH TO CHARGE AND WHAT MONTHS BUT WE CAN PUT A CONSUMER PROTECTION IN SAYING THAT IF A LOT OF SUN IS WHAT THEY'RE OFFERING THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLICITLY DISCLOSED. TO THAT PROPERTY OWNER- AND THEN THAT WAY THE INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE A DECISION IF THE FORBEARANCE IS GOING TO WORK FOR THEM OR NOT. BUT WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE AS MUCH AS WE CAN- THE CARES ACT. I COULD TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS. CENTER SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY WHICH IS. UNDER FEDERAL LAW FEDS HAVE SAID. IF YOU HAVE A FEDERALLY BACKED LOAN YOU GET UP TO A YEAR FOR PARENTS THE INDUSTRY KNOWS THAT AS A STANDARD. WHAT THE BANKING INDUSTRY WILL TELL YOU FOR NON FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS IN CALIFORNIA. IS BAY BELIEVE THEY CAN ROUGHLY MIMIC WHAT IS BEING REQUIRED FOR FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS. TO ANOTHER IS TO FOR POTENTIALLY A TWO YEAR. WHAT WE'RE SAYING WITH THIS BILL AS WE WANT TO GIVE HOMEOWNERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS UP TO A YEAR. AND THAT GIVES SOME BREATHING ROOM FOR THE TENANT TO HAVE UP TO YEAR TO PAY WE'RE TRYING TO. WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A WATERFALL EFFECT SO IT WORKS. NOW IT MAY NOT WORK ENTIRELY CORRECT TWELVE MONTHS OF NOT PAYING RENT IT MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT TWELVE MONTHS OF MORTGAGE GETS PAID BUT I THINK IT WORKS AN AWFUL LOT BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING BECAUSE IF WE DO NOTHING IN TWO WEEKS THAT LANDLORDS GOING TO HAVE TO BRING EXPENSIVE ADDICTION ACTION TO KICK OUT THE TENANT AND YOU CAN ASK LANDLORDS IF YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR UNPAID RENT FROM THAT OF FICTION. EVICTION ACTIONS ARE USED TO GET YOUR PROPERTY BACK TO KICK PEOPLE UP IN ST BUT THEY'RE VERY INEFFECTIVE ACTUALLY GETTING YOUR UNPAID RENT SO IF WE A LOT OF ACTIONS TO HELP INSURE YOU'LL KICK OUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TENANTS ON TO THE STREETS AND ALL THAT THAT HAS AN IMPACT BUT THOSE LANDLORDS WILL LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO GET A PORTION OF THAT ON THE FRONT SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE ANYWAY ALL WE'RE SAYING IS GET. TENANTS SOMETIME LET'S GIVE PROPERTY OWNERS HOMEOWNERS AND LANDLORDS SOMETIME SO THAT WE GET WE HOPEFULLY THE PANDEMIC SLOWS DOWN THE RECESSION ENDS WE GET EVERYBODY BACK ON THEIR FEET AND EVERYBODY'S MADE WHOLE BILL WOULD REQUIRE. FOR EVERYONE TO BE MADE WHOLE. MARTIN IF I MAY ADD. IS THE- PRESS HAS NOT. PAYMENT AT THE END OF THE MORTGAGE SO IF YOU WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT MONTHS AND NOT THEN SO IF IT'S NOT OF A FEDERALLY BUT IF YOU'RE SAYING NO THEN YOU CLEARLY HAVE SOME EXAMPLES BUT THE OVERALL PRACTICES BAND THAT THEY ARE ADDING IT SO INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED EIGHT MONTHS LEFT YOU'RE NOW AT A HUNDRED. AND YOU KNOW TWENTY MONTHS LEFT I DON'T THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT THANK YOU. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE CALLED OUR BANK TO INQUIRE ABOUT THIS AND THEY SAID WE ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU A FORBEARANCE OF RIGHT KIND AND THAT THEY SAID THREE FOUR MONTHS WHATEVER. BUT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO PAY THAT BACK IN FULL. AT THE END OF THAT TERM. SO HOW DOES THAT HELP SOMEONE YEAH YOU DON'T HAVE A FEDERALLY BACKED. MORTGAGE THAT WHAT THAT IS SAID PRIVATE MORTGAGE RIGHT. OKAY I'M USING THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN WE WERE ENQUIRING TWO ONE OF OUR LOCAL BANKS SO. I DON'T. I DON'T THINK THIS IS WORKING THE WAY YOU THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO WORK BUT LET ME MOVE ON BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO IT YET BECAUSE WE DO HAVE OTHERS WHO WANT US MAKING THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO THERE'S- A SEVERABILITY CLAUSE IN THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS BILL. SO IF THIS BILL OF THE PORTIONS OF THE BILL RELATING TO THE FORBEARANCE GET STRICKEN. STRICKEN DOWN IN COURT. WHAT IS STILL STANDING IS THE PART THAT SAYS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY RENT. DURING THIS PANDEMIC SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS. TO THE PEOPLE WHO. HAVE TO PAY THE MORTGAGE. WELL AGAIN OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT IS BEST FOR EVERYONE TO NOT SEE A HUGE GENERATION OF RENTERS KICKED OUT ON THE STREETS BECAUSE IF THAT HAPPENS THOSE ONES ARE NOT GONNA GET PAID ON THOSE MORTGAGES WILL NEVER HAVE A SHOT AT GETTING PAID OFF THEIR- MORTGAGE IS PAID BY LANDLORDS NO I UNDERSTAND BUT I'M I'M-ASKING YOU SERIOUSLY HAVE YOU. CONTEMPLATED ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS THIS COULD TURN OUT IF THIS DOESN'T STANDING QUARTERBACK PORTION OF THE BILL DOESN'T STAND IN COURT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T PAYING RENT BECAUSE WE PUT A LOT OF PLACES YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY RENT. BUT THE PROPERTY OWNER STILL HAS TO PAY THE MORTGAGE BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE RENT SO THEN THEY GO INTO FORECLOSURE SO THEN THE RENTER IS. OUT OF A PLACE TO STAY ANYWAY RIGHT PART OF OUR QUICK CAN'T PART OF IT A QUICK ANSWER TO YOU IS WE OBVIOUSLY SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WITH WHICH COUNCIL TO AFTER AS. PLEASE OUR AND WE FOR STRONGLY THAT WE HAVE GOOD ARGUMENTS ON TO THESE THESE PROVISIONS WOULD BE CONSTITUTION WOULD STAND IN CORPORATE DURING THE TIME OF AND PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ATTEMPT FORM OF RELIEF OKAY THANK YOU S. THANK YOU A THE QUESTIONS AGAIN- THAT WERE IN BOARD WE'RE UNCHARTERED WATERS. AND WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN AND I AGREE I THINK THAT THE LANGUAGE OF AS YOU GO THROUGH THE ANALYSIS YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE TRIED TO. MAKE IT CLEAR THE CRITERIA UNDER WHICH THESE. REQUIREMENTS ARE BEING PROMULGATED WE ARE IN A- PANDEMIC WE ARE IN A CRISIS WE ARE IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. AGAIN HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THE BANKS IN THOSE BIG LENDERS A TO TRY TO WORK WITH US AND- OF FROM THE TENANT ON UP TO THE HOMEOWNER- IT'S INTEREST SO- I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A WILL. I KNOW THERE IS NO PERFECT SOLUTION BUT- YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE- AVENUES FOR TRYING TO PURSUE WITH THAT WILL GO TO OUR BANKRUPTCY EXPERT. FROM SENATOR Y. CASKEY READY TO JUMP OUT OF MY TO DO SO. SICKENING AT THE STATE MATTER CHAIR THE A FUNDAMENTAL TO BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND NOW AND THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS IN THE EQUITY CUSHION THAT HOMEOWNERS HAVE YOU KNOW BACK IN DOWN THEY HAD BOUGHT HOUSES FOR SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THEY WERE WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND RING IN WHITE AFTER THE SHOWER SO TODAY PEOPLE HAVE CUSHION HAVE EQUITY IN THE BANKRUPTCY WORLD WE CALL THAT IN EQUITY CUSHION AND THERE'S NOT A COURT IN THE LAND THAT DOES NOT GIVE DEFERENCE TO ADD TO A BORROWER OR DEBTOR THAT HAS AN EXTRA EQUITY CUSHION YOU WITH GOING TO COURT. AND IT IS GOING TO SAY I OWE TWO HUNDRED OF FULL AND I'M NOT MAKING MY BUT THERE'S EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF EQUITY THIS PROPERTY THE LAW- OF HOPE FOR CORPORATE AND THAT'S ONE THE THINGS THAT'S SORT OF ON THE- OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE SO WITH THAT SAID I YOU KNOW THIS CUSHION EXISTS PEN. I WANTED INTO THE PREEMPTION PROBLEM SPEAK. I THINK THE THIS. FOR SCIENTIST SAYS HIS GUITAR ABOUT SEVERAL IS YOU SEE AT YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S THE MAGIC DATE WE WON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR UNIT. ON FOR THIRTY SO UNTIL APRIL. TWO TWO THOUSAND. TWENTY ONE AND THEN WE WERE WON'T KNOW WHAT THE DC UNIVERSE IS ON THE P. WHO THE- ON EITHER THE- RENT. AGREEMENTS FOR THEIR MORE AGREEMENTS APRIL SO. TWO TWENTY TWO SO AS- MS COUPLE EUROS BILL GOES AND WE'RE TO LESS PEOPLE IN THIS UNIVERSE OF THE FAULT OF FOLKS SO ON ONE OF THE PREEMPTION. BROUGHT UP BY THE SENATE BANKING HE SAID. BAKER SECTOR SETS DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY YOU GUYS SAID. MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IN MY WORLD I'M THINKING THAT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A NICE THAT OCCUR BECAUSE YOU GOT A GOOD CHUNK OF PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD BE DEALING WITH. CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT CONCERN. RIGHT SO ON THE OVERALL PREEMPTION SIDE- I THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY THAT THE A JOB OF LAYING OUT SOME OF THE CAN. BUT SOME OF THE PAST FOUR. AND THE WORST THE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE PAST FOUR AND WE- TO BE IN A WHERE THIS IS THIS STANDS ANY TEST IN COURT AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT I THINK THE ANALYSIS DOES A GOOD JOB OF DISCUSSING- YOU KNOW THE BAR AT THE ENSURING THAT THE BARS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION WHICH I THINK WAS IS VERY IMPORTANT. ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE FORBEARANCE- WE RELY ON THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS. AND SLIGHTLY YOU KNOW THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS- IS THERE TO ADD TO SOME THE CONSUMER. BUT IT ALSO. THAT THERE IS FRONT OF PRE EMPTION ON THE ISSUE I WANT TO SAY THAT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN THE DISPATCH. ON THAT THE YOU KNOW A MENTION OC RULES BULLETIN. AND IN THE EAL IN BOTH BULLETIN MAY ACCURATELY REFLECTED THE REACH OF PREEMPTION AS IT'S REFLECTED IN EXISTING FEDERAL LAW PASSED BY CONGRESS. BUT THE OCC DOES HAVE A HISTORY. OF GOING BEYOND CONGRESS AND INTO AND SO THE DISEASE WELL BE MAPS. A TO THE NINE CIRCUIT. DO THIS BUT I ALSO AT. AGAIN WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A- THAT THERE IS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS PRINTED OR NOT SPECIFICALLY THE EXAMPLE THAT'S BEEN GIVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT IN TWENTY TWELVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE HOMEOWNER. AND IT'S OUT THAT IT'S BEEN PART BECAUSE UNDER EMERGENCIES. THE AUTHOR OF THE OF THE BILL MENTIONED- THERE ARE PROTECTIONS AND STATE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE ISSUES FORWARD SO TAKING WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY DONE IN TWENTY TWELVE. LOOKING AT A PATHWAY THAT COULD TO PERHAPS CHANGE SOME OF THIS- IN TERMS OF PRE AND PREEMPTION WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT PATH. AND YOU COUPLE THAT WITH WE TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES OUR GUIDANCE THAT THEY HAVE AND WHAT OF COURSE NATURALLY YOU THINK OKAY WHAT REGULATIONS SET AT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTED BUT YOU HAVE. THE LANGUAGE OF THE CARE ACT THE INDICATION THAT WE WANT TO HAVE A FORBEARANCE FOR A YEAR AND GIVE. HER A CHANCE TO WORK OUT OF A PLANNED SO THAT'S INDICIA THAT THEY THAT THAT WE WOULD HAVE FOR THE NON FEDERALLY BACKED BANKS YOU AGREE WITH THAT WITH THAT I MEAN I'M I'M TRYING TO PERIL WHAT WITH IF YOU COULD GOING TO COURT. TO MAKE THE CITY THIS IS A WILL THAT. THAT'S THE CASE X. TO THIS YEAR FOR PERRANCE. MIMICKING A FOR THE NON FEDERALLY BACKED BY. IF YOU GO INTO WORK WE WILL ABSOLUTELY YOU CARE AS A LINK I MEAN THAT YOU KNOW ACT I GUESS I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M NOT THE THAT WOULD DO THAT BUT RIGHT I THINK THAT THE WHAT YOU AT YOU AT THE FACT THAT THE FED. GOVERNMENT HAS US GUIDELINE. AND SO THESE ARE DOT ON EMERGENCY IS ON FINISHED THE OTHER. INTERREG ANTHONY HAS. BY MEMBERS IS THAT THE EIGHT HAS POTENTIAL YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE DIFFERENCE DATE BE CARE ACT BEAT THIRD FIRST AND THIS BILL BEING MARCH THIRTY FIRST AT. THE DATA THE PEACE THEY KEEP. IT'S SEPARATED MAKE THAT SEVERAL BOLD DECISION ON THAT NOT PAGE FOURTEEN MADAM CHAIR. OF THE ANALYSIS WE TALK ABOUT THE NOTICE OF DEFAULT AND ACTUALLY GIVING. DIRECTING THE COUNTY RECORDER'S TO PUT IN A DECLARATION FROM LOAN SERVICER THAT THEY HAVE SAID THAT THE BORROWER HAS NOT SOUGHT. IS WERE WE ON DEBT THIS PAGE THIRTEEN YOU MEAN AND A PAGE THIRTEEN RIGHT YEAH AND THE THIRD PAGE THIRTEEN GOALS IN THE FOURTH PHOTO SO LET ME JUST SAY AT ONCE BEFORE ARE ASSEMBLY BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIR BUT WE ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING AT THAT POTENTIAL SUGGESTION IF THAT IS GOING TO BE ON FROM ILLEGAL FOURTEEN SO- JUST KNOW THAT THAT IS IN PROCESS BUT JUST FOR OTHERS WHO MIGHT BE A LITTLE CONFUSED WHERE THIS CONVERSATION'S GOING HERE'S THE CHALLENGE FOR TRYING TO STATE WHICH IS THE GOVERNMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR SAID. FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES YES YOU GET PARENTS THROUGH THE END OF DECEMBER. AND OUR THE DECISION THAT THEY DID NOT MAKE A RULING ON NON FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS WE WANT TO CREATE SOME. BETWEEN FEDERAL NOT. AND WE WANT TO DO THAT THROUGH FOR ANOTHER EXTRA THREE MONTHS AND SO THERE'S THIS ISSUE OF THE DATE. AND HOW TO DRIVE THIS NOW WHAT WE SEE IN THIS BILL. IS WHEN IT COMES TO FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES THE FEDERAL. REGULATORY STRUCTURE OUGHT TO APPLY THAT'S THE SAFE HARBOR ISSUE. BUT THERE'S THIS OPEN QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS FROM NON FEDERALLY BACKED. DURING THIS EXTRA TIME PERIOD AND WE'VE- MADE OUR BEST ASSESSMENT THAT. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS IS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE. A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BUT THE REALITY IS RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BECAUSE FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES HAVE. THE FULL FAITH-AND CREDIT OF THE FENCE BEHIND THEM. BUT THESE OTHERS DON'T SO WE'RE LITERALLY JUST TRYING TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AS BEST WE CAN. BUT TO GET TO STAR WHITE HOUSE KEYS POINT. IN YOU KNOW SIX WERE REFERS TO THE FACT THAT. IF YOU RESTRUCTURE THIS IN A WAY THAT NESTS THE DEFERRED PAYMENT PROGRAM WITHIN. THE NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE PROCESS IN MY PM STRONG LEGAL FOOTING WE ARE VERY SERIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS. WITH THE BANKING INDUSTRY DIRECTLY ABOUT THESE THESE POINTS SO. STATE I'M I MIGHT ALSO SUGGEST. THAT OF HOPEFULLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO EXTEND- IF THEY CAN GET BACK TOGETHER AND- COME TO AGREEMENT ON ANYTHING- TO EXTEND THE CARERS ACT. OR AT LEAST SOME PROVISIONS OF IT. SO THAT. IT THEN WE WILL BE IN SYNC- BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO ANTICIPATE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO EXCEPT TO SAY. HEY LOOK FOLKS THIS IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO. EXTENDED OUT FURTHER AND THE STATE THEN WILL BE- IN PARALLELS. SINK SYNCHRONIZATION WITH THEM. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR SOME REALLY ON. MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM FRESNO WAS TALKING ABOUT CREDIT WORTHINESS REPORTING IT TO THE CREDIT AGENCIES WHEN YOU'RE IN FOR PARENTS. CAN YOU CONTINUE TO DO-THE DEAL WHATEVER THE DEAL WAS YOU KNOW THEY YOU PAY YOUR REGULAR MORTGAGE AND YOU PAY. SIX HUNDRED BUCKS EXTERNAL THAT THERE'S NO REPORTING AT THAT TIME IT WOULDN'T BE UNTIL THERE WOULD. I GUESS WE'D SAY THE SECOND THE FULL RIGHT TO THE SECOND YOU. BREAK THE PROMISE THAT YOU MAKE UNDER THE FORBEARANCE AND THAT WOULD BE THE SAME IN THE RENTERS THERE HAS TO BE A SECOND. THOUGHT FORBEARANCE HAS ITS OWN CLASSIFICATION AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE- AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IF THERE IS A FORMAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SERVICE THE SERVICER AND- THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WILL NOT CHANGE IT HAS ITS OWN FOR PARENTS PROCESS IT'S NOT CONSIDERED- IN THE SAME AN EQUAL WAY AS- THE CREDIT REPORTING THAT WE MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF RENT. IS MANAGED THANK WHERE. PEOPLE SHOULD REMIND THEMSELVES IS THAT THIS FORBEARANCES THAT THE LENDER IS FOR BEARING ABOUT GOING INTO NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE STATE THEY THEY CAN'T DO A NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE ON 80% OF THE- OF THE BAY. OF DEBT RIGHT NOW SO I GUESS. JANUARY FIRST OR JANUARY SECOND WHENEVER THAT THAT OCCURS. IT'S OPEN SEASON FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO GO WIN PROVIDED THAT YOU'VE DEFAULTED ON THE FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT WHATEVER THAT THAT MAY BE AND THAT. THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE PEOPLE HAVE IS THAT EVEN IF THE STARTED OF THE NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE YOU HAVE NINETY DAYS TO OFFICIALLY. ENTER IN YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THAT A DECLARATION BY THE COUNTY RECORDER'S IN THERE AND THEN THERE'S A TWENTY DAY PERIOD JUST TO SETTLE SO NOBODY'S LOSING THEIR HOUSE. THAT ARE FEDERALLY GUARANTEED LOAN. BEFORE MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE ON THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AT LEAST MINE ALICE'S AND I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THE MATTER WHAT THE BIG BANKS SAY. THEY CAN'T MOVE THAT FAST AND THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVED AFTER A SETTLEMENT THEY WANT HAVE POST CHRISTMAS. DECORATIONS AT THEIR JUST FOR CLOSING ON ON EVERYBODY'S. I'M DONE I'M DONE DONE I THINK IT'S- THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ME WELL. IS A RESPONSE TO THE SAID I WOULD JUST FROM EVERY THAT A FOR CREDIT REPORTING IS NOT DELINQUENT. IT THEIR SEPARATE THINGS THESE ARE NOT DELINQUENT AND SO THEY DON'T COUNT IN A IN THAT TYPE OF WAY AND I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY ADS WERE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS- THIS BILL INDEPENDENT OF THIS BILL. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT PAY THEIR MORTGAGE OR RENT SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO HELP. THIS BILL WHAT IF THIS BILL DOESN'T EXIST THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE STILL BEARING UP BEARING A BURDEN BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CANNOT PAY THEIRMORTGAGE SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO GIVE THEM MORE TIME. NO MAN MADAM CHAIR IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE. THE BORROWER AS MUCH TIME AS THEY HAVE I MEAN IN THE WORLD OF BANKRUPTCY SOMETIMES YOU FAR YOU FILE AND YOU HE TRIED TO WORK OUT A PLAN YOU TRY TO DO IT. AND YOU MAY BE IN THEIR ONE YEAR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND ALL THAT. AND THEN IT FINALLY REALIZES I CAN'T AFFORD THAT THIS HOUSE I HAVE TO SELL THE HOUSE BUT YOU GET SOME PROTECTION. FROM JUST FLAT. WITH EVERYTHING AND AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT BOILING POTS HERE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT. THAT THINGS LOOK REALLY BAD RIGHT NOW BUT MAYBE IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY'RE BACK ON THEIR FEET AND WE REALLY WANT THEM TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN. NEGOTIATE THAT SO. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL. WE THOUGHT YOU WOULD ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WILL GO TO A SENATOR STERN WHO IS PATIENTLY WAITING. TO GIVE US HIS THOUGHTS IN ASKING A QUESTION SO WE'VE GOT TO THEIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS I UP YOU ARE UP OKAY YOU CAN SHARE IN THE- RESHAPED. THE DEBATE- ESPECIALLY THE RANGERS AS MONEY RECEIVED IT IT UNDERSCORE IT. THAT GRAVITY PRICES BECAUSE I'M IT WAS JUST A BIT AGO THAT. THE BILL DOESN'T DO IT. I KNOW IT'S SHOCKING IS IT. EXTENDED TALK. UNPRECEDENTED NATURE LET'S JUST SAY OF PURSUING THIS KIND OF REMEDY FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE NO OTHER RECOURSE BUT HEY I THINK THAT- IF I HAVE ANY CONCERN HERE- IT IS IN OUR LIMITS OF STATE LAW. AND THAT WE DO HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE AND DO WE HAVE TO. SORT OF MAKE A BET HERE THAT EVENTUALLY- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA STEP IN AND REALLY FIND A WAY TO. MEET TENANTS HOMEOWNERS LENDERS LANDLORDS THE WHOLE RANGE OF FOLKS AND MOVE THE KIND OF CAPITAL WERE NEED WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BELIEVE THE MARKETS I THINK THE RESERVISTS BEEN DOING THEIR PART BUT I THINK CONGRESS HAS GOT ACT I JUST- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IN THE EVOLVING NATURE THIS PROPOSAL. I DO HOPE THAT- GIVEN A COMPRESSED TIMELINE ON WHAT THIS NEGOTIATION HAS TO BE IN ORDER TO GET THINGS DONE- BEFORE OUR EVICTION DEADLINE HITS THAT YOU WILL- CONTINUE TO KEEP THIS COMMITTEE A PRIZE I HAVE A LOT OF TRUST IN OUR CHAIR AND- THE STAFF HERE BUT I KNOW THAT- THIS IS GOING TO GO FAST. SO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THE SORT OF KEY MOVING PIECES ARE GOING TO BE IN MY SENSE IS THAT THE- D. THE LENDING COMMUNITY AND- AND THE LANDLORDS ARE BOTH- WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE I MEAN I'VE HEARD. REPEATEDLY CALLS FOR TAX CREDITS OR SOME KIND OF TAX WRITE OFF OPTION- FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFILL THE TERMS OF THEIR MORTGAGE- AND BE ABLE TO WRITE THAT OFF AS AN EXPENSE OR FIND SOME OTHER RECOURSE I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE OPTION TO HAVE ON THE TABLE AND I HOPE THAT THAT- IS THOUGHT OF IN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF THIS TENET. RELIEF FRAMEWORK I THINK THEY'RE BOTH NECESSARY. I WOULD ALSO JUST ADD THOUGH THAT- NOT OLD BANKS ARE CREATED THE SAME. AND I EAT I DO WONDER IF YOU ALL GIVEN THOUGHT TO- THE COMMUNITY BANKS AND SOME OF OUR LOCAL CREDIT UNIONS WHO. MAY BE- WITHIN THEIR PORTFOLIO HAVE A- A LARGER RANGE OF THE KIND OF. LOANS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT. THAT MACY GOOD DAY KIND OF FORBEARANCE- THAT'S ALLOWED BY THIS LEGISLATION REALLY WHAT WE DO IN THOSE THOSECASES- WE DON'T. WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT OPERATING MODEL AND CERTAINLY DIFFERENT PROFIT MODELS- AND ONE THAT'S MEMBER DRIVEN ON THE STUDY SHAREHOLDER DRIVEN SO. WE KNOW IT'S SORT OF A DIFFERENT SET OF MOTIVES. CAN YOU CAN EITHER I'M NOT SURE WHICH OF THE AUTHORS ARE BETTER. SITUATED AND- WHICHEVER GIVE IT GIVE US SOME INSIGHT ON THAT ISSUE BUT I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TALK ABOUT. THAT UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT. HELLO START ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION SO. AS WE WERE CONTEMPLATING ADDING MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE PROVISIONS- ONE OF THE FIRST. STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE REACH OUT TO WHERE THE CREDIT UNIONS ARE TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND WE'VE HAD. AS ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS- DESCRIBES THE AUTHOR'S REPORT. A HEALTHY BACK AND FORTH WITH THE CREDIT UNIONS OVER A POSSIBLE EXEMPTION FOR THE BILL- AND IT LAYS OUT A COUPLE THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN. WRESTLER WITH. ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO MIMIC THE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS. BUT THIS EXEMPTION MIGHT SWEEP TOO BROADLY LEAVING MANY HOMEOWNERS AND LANDLORDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO FORBEARANCE. ANOTHER OPTION THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IS. TO POTENTIALLY- CONSIDER AN EXEMPTION BASED ON INSTITUTIONS SIZE SO. THIS LITERALLY LAYS OUT- THAT WITH THE CONVERSATIONS AND WHAT I WOULD SAY S- I'M VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THIS. TO COMPLETELY IN A GOOD PLACE TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. I THINK SPEAKING FOR MYSELF VERY MUCH RESPECT THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT. CREDIT UNIONS AND OTHER COMMUNITY BASED NO. LENDER PROVIDE AND WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. THAT SO- SO VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION AND I. AM HOPEFUL THAT BY THE TIME THIS GETS THE SENATE FLOOR- HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE ARRIVED AT AT AT AT AT A BETTER SPOT IN THAT. AND I CAN'T KISS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEóN. AND I WILL ADD IT YOU KNOW THAT I CONCUR WITH THE AUTHOR I THINK IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE STILL HAVING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT CREDIT UNIONS ON AND CERTAINLY THERE'S A LIST OF. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT. ARE ASKING TO BE LOOKED AT DIFFERENTLY- IS ALSO BECAUSE THE MOST RECENT REPORTS FROM THE PARK DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNIONS HAVE VERY ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVELS. AND EVEN AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE EXPECTED LOSSES RECORDED BY THE CREDIT UNIONS IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THE AVERAGE CAPITAL LEVEL FOR CRACK CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNIONS REMAINS ABOVE 11% WHICH- EXCEEDS. THE 7% THRESHOLD FOR REGULATORS TO DEEM. I CREDIT UNIONS AS WELL THE LIGHT. SO I THINK WE ARE TO IGNORE. THAT THERE'S STILL A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS- BECAUSE THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION- IS SUCH THAT THESE THAT THEY OUT THEY STILL HAVE BARS. AND WE WANT TO KNOW HOW WE CAN HELP THE BARS THAT HAVE. AT A CREDIT UNION- LOAN MORTGAGE AND SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST. SOLVE THIS- AND ALSO THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT OF INTEREST I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S LEGISLATORS CARE. A LOT ABOUT THE WORLD OF CREDIT UNIONS AND COMMUNITY BANKS- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE DATA AND FACTS TO. HELP INFORM US ON HOW WE MOVE FORWARD FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO HAVE. AGES UNDER THOSE AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. I THINK THAT'S VERY WISE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DID. YOU TRY TO BE EVIDENCE DRIVEN AND ENGAGE D. B. O. FRANKLY AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN THIS PROCESS AND- WHAT THE DATA FOR. DRIVE YOU ON THE STATE OF BOTH CAPITAL MARKETS IS OF OUR OUR- AT THE CAN BE MADE. ASSEMBLY THIS COULD PASS QUITE YEAH DEVIN SORT OF THE- THAT'S THE BIG RED LINE BUT THAT'S ENLIGHTENING THOSE NUMBERS- OKAY. WELL YOU KNOW LISTEN IT. WE'RE IN A SPOT HERE I THINK. WE GOT A PERSON THIS OPTION RIGHT NOW. I WISH WE WERE IN THIS. AND WE ACTUALLY HAD TO SAY ADEQUATE CAPITAL GOING TO THOSE FOR PANDEMIC RELIEF AND HAVE A STEADY FLOW SO THAT WE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO. PURSUE THESE OTHER REMEDY BUT GIVEN THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCE THE PEOPLE ARE AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN. AFFORD TO BREAK FAMILIES AND BREAK THIS WHOLE ECONOMIES ALL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY AND- REALLY THANK YOU GUYS FOR. JUST BEING GENERATED WITH US AND REALLY DETAIL ORIENTED THIS IS A VERY VERY TOUGH. CLAIM TO LAND IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRECISION SO- COUNT ON ALL OF US TO BE HELPING YOU OUT AND- TRY TO FIGURE OUT SOME SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO BOTH AUTHORS AND OTHERS HAS BEEN A VERY- GREAT LONG DISCUSSION BUT IT'S THIS IS A REALLY AWESOME AND MEASURED ASAL I BELIEVE- THAT PROVIDES OPTIONS ALL AROUND THE ECONOMIC CYCLE I KNOW WE'VE OFTEN HISTORICALLY TALKED ABOUT TENANTS BUT INCORPORATING OUR SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE MIX I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD GOOD PLACE TO BE- ALL OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED BUT I WILL SAY NO. ACCESS TO CAPITAL SIMILAR TO IT CENTER MINING SAID DOESN'T AFFECT SOME OF US. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WE'VE SEEN HAS PROPROVIDED THAT CAPITAL TO MANY OF OUR LARGE BANKS MANY OF OUR LARGER COMPANIES ESPECIALLY IN THE SMALL BUSINESS FROM THE PPP LOANS. THEY'VE HAD ACCESS AND THAT'S STILL FLOWING- WHAT I DO- SIMILAR TO WHAT HE'D MENTION AS WELL THOUGH AS I DO- ALSO HAVE A CONCERN EVERY PAYMENT AFTERWARDS BUT I SAID I KNOW THAT-THIS WILL BE AN EVOLVING DISCUSSION AND THIS IS NOT GONNA STOP EVEN AFTER. THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE DATE. AND SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH AGAIN FOR YOUR WORK AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SOME REPRIEVE DURING THIS TIME. VERY DIFFICULT TIME SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ AND A CENTER- BURKE I BELIEVE YOU HAD SOME QUESTIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CHU IN THE MONTH OF FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS AS I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A SOMETHING YOU'RE CONTINUE WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS POINT. RIGHT EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY FOR MANY MANY DAYS AND THIS BILL.

HURT IN THIS PANDEMIC HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE COMPLETELY INNOCENT I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT TO WORK WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW. BUT PRACTICALITY IT AND POLITICAL REALITIES HERE TO BE ABLE TO SPREAD THE RISK- SADLY THE RISK CAN'T BE SPREAD AS FAR AS IT SHOULD BE SPREAD. OF THAT YEAR. APPORTIONING THAT RISKS TO CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS THAT YOU BELIEVE CAN BEAR THE RISK BETTER THAN OTHERS AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I VIEW WHAT WHAT YOUR OBJECT IS. I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT YOU'RE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE IT MORE EQUITABLE- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE FINAL PRODUCT HERE BELIEVES CAN MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE ELSE LOOK FOR TO SEE THE FINAL PRODUCT THANK YOU. THE BILL. YES OUR CENTER MELENDEZ AND THEN WE WILL CLOSE IT UP SO THAT WE CAN GET ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT'S THE RECOURSE FOR- THE PROPERTY OWNER IF- YOU IF THE TENANT.

WHAT IS THE RECOURSE FOR THE PROPERTY ON THE RECOURSE WOULD BE TYPICAL CIVIL ACTION. SO YOU COULD GO AFTER THE TENNESSEE WOULD FOR ANY CONSUMER DEBT. AS LONG OKAY AS LONG AS IT'S BEYOND TO THE- AS LONG AS BEYOND THE DATES THAT WE HAVE SET IN THIS WHICH BY THE WAY TO- CENTER ON BREAKS POINT ARE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE UNDER DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS O WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE TIME FRAMES FOR WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING.

TO INJECT FUNDING INTO THE HOUSING MARKET THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT THAT WE WOULD ALL LOVE TO BE THERE- AND ALL OF TO CONSIDER THAT PROPOSAL BUT THAT'S NOT A REALITY THAT'S IT'S NOT A REALISTIC PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF US BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT DISPLACING PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES IS NOT ONLY DISRUPTING. TO THOSE SPECIFIC FAMILIES BUT IT'S ALSO COSTLY AND DISRUPTIVE TO ALL OF OUR SOCIETY PARTICULARLY IN THE TIME OF THE HEALTH PANDEMIC I HOPE THAT WE CAN BASS THIS BILL TODAY AND WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO TRY TO TAILOR THE SOLUTION TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIANS WHO DESPERATELY NEED OUR HELP WHETHER THIS BILL EXIST OR NOT BIG ISSUE REMAINS. AND I THINK IT IS UP TO US TO TRY TO IDENTIFY HOW TO BEST HELP MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT INCLUDES TENANTS LANDLORDS HOMEOWNERS THE BILL DOESN'T SOLVE EVERY SINGLE ISSUE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS OR THAT TENANT LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS HAVE BUT IT DOES GIVE.

VERY LIKELY BE CONTINUE CHANGES AS WE MOVE TO THE FLOOR- BUT- THIS CRISIS DISCOVERED CRISIS IS GOING TO BE A DEFINING MOMENT. IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY IN OUR LIFETIMES. AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN AN INCREDIBLE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE AND ECONOMIC DEVASTATION. WE HAVE ONLY TWO WEEKS TO ENACT POLICIES TO HELP CALIFORNIANS WHETHER.

SIX THREE TWO EIGHT SIX EIGHT SIX AND WITH THAT I THINK- WE'RE ALL SET TO GO AHEAD ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE FLOOR'S YOURS FILE ITEM ONE AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I BELIEVE THIS BILL SHOULD NOT BE AS CONTROVERSIAL AS A YEAR MORNING BILL- THIS IS AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX WHICH IS A BILL ABOUT SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES ALSO KNOWN AS THE E. SCOOTERS AND E. BIKES. THE GOALS OF THIS BILL ARE LIKE SAFETY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. THIS BILL IS CO SPONSORED BY THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA PROP AND SUPPORTED BY A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE A. R. P. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND. IN RECENT YEARS MANY CITIES IN OUR STATE HAVE SEEN A BONE AN E. SCOOTER AND E. BIKE USE ON OUR STREETS AND SIDEWALKS SOMETIMES APPEARING OVERNIGHT. WITHOUT ANY PRIOR NOTICE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES. PISI SCOOTERS AND E. BIKES CAN BE FUN AFFORDABLE AND ECO FRIENDLY WAYS TO GET AROUND. BUT WITH ANY NEW INNOVATIVE PRODUCT OR SERVICE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS SAFE FOR BOTH THE USERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WITH BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR YOU. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE FOR THINGS NUMBER ONE. SHARED MOBILITY SERVICE PROVIDERS LIKE BURDEN LINE MUST ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH OR OBTAIN A PERMIT FROM THE CITY BEFORE THEY OPERATE IN A CITY. NUMBER TWO THE PROVIDERS MUST PROVIDE MINIMUM LEVELS OF LIABILITY INSURANCE. NUMBER THREE PROVIDERS WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM USING BOILERPLATE WAIVER OF LIABILITY LANGUAGE AND THEIR USER AGREEMENTS. AND FOR CITIES MUST ADOPT LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY RULES ON THE OPERATION PARKING AND MAINTENANCE OF THE DEVICES BEFORE ENTERING INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH OR ISSUING A PERMIT TO A SHARED MOBILITY PROVIDER. WITH ME HERE TODAY SUPPORT THAT HERE WITH ME IN THE ROOM BUT- I AM VIRTUALLY IS CHRIS DOLAN. SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. AND DEREK DOLPHY- TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE THANK YOU AND A REMINDER WE WILL PROVIDE WITNESSES- THE JUDGE IS A MAIN WITNESSES WILL HAVE A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES TO BE DIVIDED UP AS THEY CHOOSE- AND THEN WE WILL GO TO A PUBLIC COMMENT THERE AFTER- BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START I BELIEVE YOU INDICATED- CHRIS NOLAN AND ERIC DOLPHY- NEITHER OF WHOM ARE. APPEAR TO BE HERE. ARE THEY THEY'RE ON THE PHONE ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD AND LET'S START WITH. ALL RIGHT LET'S START WITH CRYSTALLINE CRESCENDO FOR MINUTES TOTAL AND- GO AHEAD THE CLOCK IS RUNNING. THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE ON THIS COMMITTEE. THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE AS WE SAW WITH. UBER LIFT IN TNCS THEY WERE DROPPED ON OUR CITIES WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT PLANNING OR POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IS FULLY BEHIND THE IDEA OF REDUCING. CARBON EMISSIONS CONGESTION AND PROVIDING MORE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS INCLUDING THE LAST MILE OPTIONS. WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOWEVER IS MAKING SURE THAT IT IS SAFE FOR THE CONSUMERS TABLE IN OTHERS IT. WILL I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE REPORTS INCLUDING FROM THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND FROM OTHER EMERGENCY ROOM GROUPS AND THIS THING CALLED THE CDC THERE INDICATING THAT THE SEVERITY OF THE INJURIES WITH THESE PARTICULAR MOBILITY DEVICES. ARE EXTREME WITH OVER HALF OF THEM RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT BRAIN TRAUMA SO WHAT WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO IS TO ALLOW ENTRY AND REMOTE ENTRY FOR SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES BY REQUIRING THE CITIES TO DEVELOP PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SO THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS THE BILL ALSO HOWEVER REQUIRES FIFTY PROVIDERS AS WE DID WITH UBER AND LEFT WITH. ANITA BACK IN TWENTY TWO NINETY THREE AND TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TAKE KERRY INSURANCE THESE ARE NOT SUPPORTING- VEHICLES THIS IS NOT A SPORT IT'S TRANSPORTATION LIKE THE RENTAL CAR. IN THESE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE BEING BACKED BY UBER AND LEFT IN SOME OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES OUT THERE SO THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN INSURANCE SO IF THEIR DEVICE NOT IF THE WRITER DOES SOMETHING WRONG. BUT IF THEIR DEVICE FAILS THEN THERE IS- COVERAGE TO PROVIDE FOR THE INJURED PERSON SO THEY DON'T WIND UP DESTITUTE AND ARE ON THE. THE CITY'S DAHLE. SO DO YOU DIVIDE ARE ARE FAIR. IN SUCH WAY BREAK STATE. WITH THE HANDLEBAR COMING OFF IT PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE INJURY. EVERYTHING I'M GONNA FACTORING THESE DEVICES AS WELL AND THEY HAVE THESE ONEROUS RELEASING WAIVERS THAT RELEASED HIM FROM ALL LIABILITY INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR THE VEHICLE THAT THEY MAIN THEY THEMSELVES MAY CONSTRUCT OR SOMEONE ELSE MANUFACTURES CHRISTIAN REDUCE TANGLING WITH YOU NO RECOURSE CHRIS YOU'VE TAKEN TWO AND A HALF MINUTES LEAVING. A DIRECT ALL FEET A MINUTE AND A HALF AT YOUR CALL BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU THE ARMY THEY'RE NOT I WILL CONCLUDE. I WILL CONCLUDE BY REQUESTING THAT YOU PLEASE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER DOLPHY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JACKSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEECH YOU TODAY ON AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX. I'M AT SOME WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI HAS INDICATED UNIVERSITIES EXPERIENCE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES PRACTICALLY OVERNIGHT WITHOUT PRIOR CONSULTATION. THIS IS FORCE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RUSH TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS REGARDING SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AN ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION SERVICES AND PUBLIC RESOURCES. AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE DEVICE PROVIDERS CHAPEL PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FROM CITIES- WHERE THEY WISH TO OPERATE BEFORE DEPLOYING THEIR DEVICES. IT'S INCLUDES REQUIRING SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE PROVIDERS TO COMPLY WITH ALL LOCAL OPERATION PARKING MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY RULES. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT PREEMPT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I'M OR RESTRICT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM DECIDING FOR THEMSELVES IF AND HOW THESE DEVICES SHOULD OPERATE IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX ALSO INCLUDE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL GIVEN THE PREVAILING TO BE DEVICES ON CALIFORNIA'S SIDEWALKS AND STREETS. DELETED CALIFORNIA CITIES CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE SAFE RESPONSIBLE DEPLOYMENT OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICE PROVIDERS- AND THEIR DEVICES THAT ENCOURAGE ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. BUT WHILE ALSO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC SERVICE WE BELIEVE THIS. BILL DOES. BACK THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I LIKE TO RE. PLEASE TRY WOULD. TO STAY ON THE MUTE.

AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX SHORT CIRCUITS ALL OF THAT STATE AND LOCAL WORK AND WOOD WIDEOUT MICHAEL BILITY IN CALIFORNIA ALL TOGETHER IT DOES SO BY STRIPPING LEGAL PROTECTIONS FROM SHARED BIKES AND SCOOTERS THE SAME LEGAL PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA IMPOSING THE STANDARD ONLY ON THE JAMYCHAL ABILITY INDUSTRY AND NO ONE ELSE IS DEVASTATING TO THE BY CONSIDERED THAT MAKE. OUR AIR CLEANER AND OUR ROADS SAFER. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROTECT. LISTING CAL LAW ALREADY RIGHT AT THE DO EVERY THAN YOU CAN'T WAIT YOUR RIGHT TO SUE IF YOU'RE INJURED BY A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT NO MATTER WHAT THAT PRODUCT IS THAT WE COMPLY WITH THE SAME PRODUCT. LIABILITY LAW APPLICABLE TO EVERYONE ELSE THAT MEANS INSURANCE BECAUSE EVERY FOR WHICH WE ARE LIABLE BUT NOT FOR INCIDENTS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. THIS BILL CHANGES THAT. EXPOSING BOTH US AND THE CITY THAT WORK WITH A- LIABILITY OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. THE REAL QUESTION TODAY IS WHETHER BIKES AND SCOOTERS SHOULD BE SINGLED OUT FOR A NEW AND MORE BURDENSOME LIABILITY STANDARD. THAN ANY OTHER CONSUMER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. KNOW WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO BE TAKING SOCIALLY DISTANT RURAL MISSION AND PEOPLE BILLY OPTIONS AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA. IT'S BEEN. NEED MORE SOCIALLY DIFFERENT TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS OR FEWER. DURING THE CLIMATE CRISIS SHOULD WE ADD TENS OF MILLIONS OF CHARACTERS BACK ON GEORGE STREET ANNUALLY. DURING THESE PAST THREE YEARS CITIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE FOUND THAT THE MORE TRIPS TAKEN BY BY COMPUTERS AND THE PEOPLE BY CAR. THE STATE FOR OUR STREETS CAN BE FOR EVERYONE. TOGETHER WITH OUR CITIES AND OUR WRITERS WE HAVE SPENT YEARS WORKING THE LEGISLATURE TO ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA'S REPLACEMENT PARTS OF THE BY COMPUTER CHIPS. IN A STATE OF ANIMAL AN EQUITABLE WAY. EXCEPT FLOUTED THAT COLLABORATED PROP. ONE QUICK TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS ARE NEEDED THE MOST. HE TOLD ME DISTRICTS WOULD ELIMINATE THEM.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JUSTIN HIGHER AND I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX BECAUSE IT UNFAIRLY TARGETS SHARED MICHAEL ABILITY IN CALIFORNIA AND THREATENED EXISTENCE BY DENYING AT THE SAME LEGAL PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY WE WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOES NOT DO. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROTECT RIDERS FROM DEFECTIVE BIKES R SCOOTERS BEGIN EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY SEES TO THAT INSTEAD IT SINGLES OUT ONE INDUSTRY AND ESTABLISHES A NOVEL LEGAL STANDARD ONLY APPLICABLE TO THE SHARED BY THE MOBILITY SECTOR FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GO SKIING YOU VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO ASSUME CERTAIN RISKS YOU AGREE THAT YOU WANT TO JUST BECAUSE YOU FELL DOWN OR CRASHED INTO SOMEONE ELSE OF COURSE BECAUSE WE DON'T WAIT RIGHT TO SUE THANK YOU COLLAPSES WHAT YOU'RE RENTING HE'D BREAK. BECAUSE BECKY THE CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY SPEAK TO WHAT THOSE WAIVERS PROVISIONS CAN AND CAN'T SAY AND SKI RESORTS RELY ON THAT ESTABLISHED LAW TO SCOPE THE RISK AND PROTECT AGAINST LIABILITY OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL IF YOU ARE THE RESORT OR RENT OUT CARS OR ENGAGE IN ANY OTHER CONSUMER FACING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN. EITHER STOP SLOP TO LIMIT AND CONTROL WHY BY STATE EXCEPT I CAN THEY ALONE UNDER THE BELT. IN OUR INDUSTRY TO. TURNING DECADES SALAS LAWSUIT ALONE BE OF A- TO A- AB TWELVE EIGHTY. HOWEVER WE PARTICULAR CONCERNED IT HELPS ALREADY PAY NUMEROUS EITHER OTHER ALSO. THAT PER THEM FOR WRITING BIKES SCOOTERS. FURTHER IF I'M WHY ENSURING HIKE ON A INDUSTRY THAT IS EVEN OP. AT FULL CAPACITY THAT WITH THE FUTURE THAT'S QUITE UNCERTAIN EVEN BEING CONSIDERED DURING THIS CRISIS. AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX WOULD BE THE FINAL STRAW ALL THAT DURING THE CALIFORNIANS GET BACK INTO THEIR CARS INSTEAD. MORE ZERO EMISSION SOCIALLY ENTRANCE.

SIX ALL RIGHT THEN LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I JUST GOT A COUPLE COMMENTS. I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE- COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE IS NO NEW LIABILITY STANDARD. THIS BILL SIMPLY RESTRICTS THESE COMPANIES FROM HAVING USERS WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS. THEY THEY INDICATE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS A CAMPY WAY THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BUT THAT NONE THE LESS THEY STILL IN THERE BECAUSE- TO RECALL. THAT WAIVER EVEN THOUGH ARGUABLY IT IS INVALID BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY WOULD OTHERWISE ASSUME THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT. OR RECOURSE. I WANTED TO MAKE A POINT CLEAR. AND OF COURSE GIVEN THE DRAMATIC RISE IN PREVALENCE IN THESE DEVICES IT IS EXPECTED THAT LOCAL AND STATE REGULATION IS RACING TO CATCH UP. THIS BILL REQUIRES PROVIDERS INTO AGREEMENTS OBTAIN PERMITS OR THEY CAN OPT. OKAY GOVERNMENTS TO. BASE RULES OF HOW THESE. CAN OPERATE WE DO THAT WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS- AND AS I MENTIONED THE WAIVER PROVISION. IN THIS BILL IT DOESN'T REQUIRE OTHER PROVIDER TO WAIVE ANY LEGAL RIGHTS OR DEFENSES THEY HAVE A CHOICE SIMPLY RESTRICTS THESE COMPANIES FROM REQUIRING. THAT THE USER IS A CONDITION OF USE OF THIS OF THESE- ARE. OF THE VEHICLES THE RIVER WHICH THE USER TO WAVERLY'S OR OTHERWISE LIMIT THEIR RIGHTS. THE BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T. SO I. YOU KNOW IT'S EXCITING SOMETHING AS THINGS SAY THEY ARE OF AN OF VEHICLE THERE THEY THEY SERVE AN ACTUAL PURPOSE- BUT OF THIS CONCERNS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE THERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID. ALITY IN THE ABSOLUTE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IS ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL SO- AT ANY RATE. I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT AND TO. OPEN UP FOR DISCUSSION WE'VE GOT A MISTER WE GET CENTER- BERG WHITE HOUSE KIAN AND ABORTIONS IF ASKED TO SPEAK AT A SORRY YES MISTER I JUST CAUGHT YOU SO WE'LL PUT YOU. AFTER SAID. BOARD ZIP. THAT'S A PATIENT WAIT VERY GOOD ARE RIGHT CENTER RUMBA I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LET ME DIRECT COUPLE QUESTIONS AS OPPONENTS OF MR FOOD IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE. LOOK LOOK BETTER ALL RIGHT BUT LET ME UNDERSTAND SO IT IF I UNDERSTOOD YOUR TESTIMONY CORRECTLY I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WAIVER DOES AND ITS IMPACT AND HOW IT PROTECTS- THAT'S- SO IF A SCOOTER IN THE BRAKES FAIL THEN THE PERSON WHO WAS THE WRITER THAT PERSONS INJURED DOES THE WAIVER IN ANY WAY TAX BIRD FROM ABILITY. SENATOR IT DOES NOT IN WHEN THERE ISN'T THAT IS OUR LIABILITY- THE BECAUSE OF THE PROTECT THE PRODUCT OR TO OTHER WEEK THESE WAIVERS DON'T LIMIT ELIMINATE THAT RECOURSE IN ARGUE THESE WAIVERS. FROM WE CONSIDER OURSELVES SUBJECT TO THE SAME PRODUCT LIABILITY. OR WHAT'S THE GOING GUIDING OKAY LET LET ME WHAT CAUSE OF ACTION OR WHAT LIMITED WITH DOES THE WAIVER PER FOR YOU. ANOTHER WORD WHAT BECAUSE TAX ARE WOULD BE VICE. IF SIGNED THE WAIVER. FOR MARKETS BECAUSE ACTION ARE NOT LIABLE ARE THE THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO BAD NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR LIABILITY SPECIFICALLY BOOKS AS PART THE CONDITIONS OF THESE OF THESE WAY. AS WE ARE THE TRUTH FOR ALL. CALIFORNIA USERS USE CAN CAN'T CAN'T HOLD CANNOT RECALL IN EUREKA ARE NOT THE RESULT OF OUR LIVES. DATE CANNOT RECOVER FOR INJURIES MAY RESULT OUR THEIR OWN THAT OR THEIR OWN. WE'VE END AFTER THAT'S THE THRUST ABOUT LIKE THAT WE THAT THAT WE THAT WE TO FOCUS ON TODAY WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE BILL RELATING. IF THE INJURY WAS OUTSIDE OF YOUR CONTROL- THIS BILL DOESN'T ELIMINATE NAY DEFENSES RIGHT. ERIC SCRIPT. SENATOR DO YOU BEAT WHAT IS STILL DOES IS IT IS IT THE ELIMINATES THE FORECLOSURE OF THE LAWSUIT THAT NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR HAVE NOTHING TO WITH OUR LIVE THAT IS TO SAY AT PART OF THE OF AND OUR OF THE AGREEMENT THAT YOU SIGNED WHEN YOU EVER YOU WANT OUR BIKE OR OF OUR YOU AGREE CANNOT. THANK YOU BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. HELLO FOR THE- PART OF THE WORK THAT ARE NOT THAT ARE NOT OUR LIABILITY. THATDOES. THAT REPRESENT IN OF YOUR LEGAL RIGHT TO RUN THE THAT WE THAT THE ACTORS BY QUALITY. THE LANGUAGE BROAD LANGUAGE WITHIN THE BILL THAT TO LET THE WHOLE HOLD ON FOR AND PROVISION OF ANY. THAT A USER'S TO RUN THAT ANYWAY. INTERESSE WHY SHOULD TO THE PROSECUTION WITNESS ALL RIGHT OF CENTER Y. CAO SKI. BENCHER THANK YOU I CAN I THIS SEEMS PRETTY THE MINIMUM. INSURANCE YOU MAY LIKE IT AND PROHIBITION OF WAY FOR RIGHTS THOSE ARE SORT OF ON MOVED MICHAEL MOBILITY CLEAN WILL. LAST MILE MOBILITY PEOPLE BUT THE PERMITTING AND THE LOCAL OPERATIONAL OR MAINTENANCE OR PUBLIC SAFETY RECALLS ARE ON THE CITIES AND- I MAY BE SKEPTICAL BUT I FELT SOME OF THE CITY SAID I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY. YOU SEE ASK ABOUT ALLOWS MILE IN THE CLEAN MALL SO I'M WONDERING AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BILL YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG. THAT WOULD SAY IF. THIS SAYS. THREE YEARS OR TWO TO THE DAY ARE AT THE TOP TO PERMIT PROCESS FOR THEIR- OPERATIONAL MEET. OR PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THESE LAST VIA BECAUSE THERE COULD BE SOME CITY SOME CITIES OF JAPAN THEM THAT WILL DO NOT. AND THOSE RESIDENTS WERE NEVER THAT OPPORTUNITY. FOR THIS CLEAN. UP. MOTOR TREND SO. WHAT HAPPENS. THIS YEAR BECAUSE TO SEN. IF THE CITY THIS SIZE NOT TO APPROVE. THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE TO BE PROVIDED IN THERE ARE SO WHAT RECALL WE CAN HAVE RIGHT BUT SEE BUT SEE THE ONE OF THESE. LEFT STATE THEY REDO THE CONTRACTS THEY HAVE THE THEY HAVE THEIR. INSURANCE THESE WE WANT TO WE WANT TO PROVIDE THESE THINGS THEY GOING THE CITY THE CITY. WE HAVE NO PER FOR. BUT WE WERE NOT GOING TO PASS A MAIDEN LAW ON THESE WOULD OCCUR YOU ANY IT'S SORT OF A GIVE TRADE IF YOU YOU DO. WHAT HAPPENS HELLO CAN SEE SO WANT TO SOME TIME. BUT I'M CONCERNED THERE BE SOME HAVE TRYING TO REALLY PROVIDE THESE CLEAN MODE. AS LONG AS WE CARE OF THE CONSUMER. THERE MAY SOME ENACT. FROM SOME RE. CAL OUT THE THAT JUST SAYS NO WAY NOT GOING TO DO WITH THIS CURRENTLY I MEAN I THINK A- AND WE ARE. A CITIES THAT. TOO BAD AND SOME OF THESE REMOTE DEVICES FOR THESE LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN OVER THE WAY THEY WERE THESE THE SERVICES ARE THE DEVICE WERE OUT. IN COMMUNITY AGAIN BOB OVERNIGHT UP ON ON THIS AND SAW I THINK THE ULTIMATE RECORD FOR MEMBERS. THAT ARE ENDING IS. IS IT. IS. STILL THERE THERE EITHER ON THEIR LOCAL COUNCILS. STREETS ARE ON THE SIDEWALKS AT ALL I THINK THAT- IS UP TO EACH CITY BUT YOU KNOW I WANT TO EMPHASIZE A MAN AS AN ENVIRONMENTALIST I WANT TO SEE THIS MICROBE BILITY INDUSTRY THRIVE AND YOU KNOW- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT THAT SHOULD PREVENT. THE THIS INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE- BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR CONCERNS I THINK IT YOU KNOW WE ARE LIVING UP TO CITIES TO MAKE THAT DESERVE DETECT DISINTEREST THERE'S A TRADE OFF FOR MADAM CHAIR AND I CAN I GET THE FACT THAT WE WANT TO HAVE SOME CONTROL IN SOME ORDINANCES I'M JUST IT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I PICKED UP THAT THAT IF. A CITY SAYS WE'RE NOT GOING TO PASS AN ORDINANCE THEN THESE BUSINESSES WOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM DOING THAT IF THEY AS LONG AS THEY DO THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN THE BILL THAT. OUR HARD DRIVE. THE TRAIN SO. OKAY I SAID STATE LAURIE THANK YOU CENTER BORCHERS THANK YOU. WE HAD A VERY SPIRITED THE DISCUSSION ON ONE OF YOUR OTHER BILLS LAST WEEK I SEE YOU AGAIN IT IS HERE- IN FORGIVE ME I HAVE TO POSE THE QUESTION AS I DID LAST WEEK ON HOW THIS IS CODED RELATED. BUT THANK YOU WELL FIRST OF ALL THIS BILL- IS A TWO YEAR BILL AND SO- IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED- LAST YEAR UNDER. A VERY DIFFERENT TIME AS AS WE ALL KNOW. BY YOU KNOW I WOULD SUBMIT THAT- THIS BILL IS CALLED RELATED AND THAT- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TO. THAT AS- YOU KNOW THE SERVICES CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDED IN COMMUNITIES THAT. THAT THERE ARE- YOU KNOW THE- YOU KNOW THE CERTAIN DEVICES AND SERVERS SERVICES ARE ARE PROVIDED IN A WAY THAT THAT IS SAFE FOR CONSUMERS- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IF- IF YOU WILL. HAD CALLED IT AND YOU NEED TO GET AROUND IT YOU DON'T HAVE A CAR OR BUS AND FOR YOU HAVE A E. SCOOTER YOU KNOW HAND IN FRONT OF YOUR HOME THEN YOU CN LEARN. ALL OF THE OLD ALMOST ALL STOP AT LINE INQUIRY I THINK WE SHOULD TURN THIS INTO A DRINKING GAME EVERY TIME WE ASK IF IT'S COVERED RELATED. THE VERBAL ACROBATS ARE EXTRAORDINARY. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION I DO I DO ACTUALLY DO. SO MOVING ONTO TO THE MERITS OF IT- SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY SEEMS LIKE IT MAKES SENSE TO ME- HAVING THE POLICIES. THE INSURANCE- LIABILITY. POLICIES IN PLACE. AND. THE OTHER THING IS THAT MAKES THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE WHAT CAUSES ME ANGST IS THE WAIVER. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. EXISTS I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD EARLIER BUT THEN I THINK WE HAD TO SOME TELEPHONE ENQUIRIES- IN AND MAYBE TO LOOK AT MORE CONFUSING. I RENT. A SCOOTER RIDE I GET ON THE SCOOTER AND I HIT SOMEONE. THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT THAT THIRD PARTY IS THAT THIRD PARTY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE. THE SCOOTER COMPANY. THEY MAY HAVE- DISINVITE AND THE CAUSE OF ACTION TO SUE THE COMPANY IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF THE CASE I THINK AS THE MATH MADAM CHAIR INDICATED THIS THIS. CHANGE TORT LAW IN IN ANY WAY AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE MAY BE- A DUTY ON BEHALF OF THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE PROVIDER- TO THE THIRD PARTY- YOU KNOW IF IT WAS A CASE OF SAY WITHOUT COULD FACE THAT WAS NOT MAINTAINED. ARE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT PART SO IT HAVE THAT LET'S MOVE TO THE PRIMARY USER I'M ON THE SCOOTER. EIGHT FORGET THE MECHANIC FAILURE THAT SEEMS CLEAR THAT. IN THAT EVENT THERE WOULD BE- LIABILITY EXPOSURE. I DIDN'T TIE MY SHOELACES I FALL OFF BREAK MY LEG. CAN I. THEN WITHOUT THIS WAIVER ODD WHAT I'D BE ABLE TO SUE THE SCOOTER COMPANY FOR THAT. AGAIN THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE EXISTING TORT LAW- IF THEY HAVE A BECAUSE IT OUT OF ACTION. BUT I MEAN IF THE- IF THE PROVIDERS. YOU KNOW DID NOT BREACH ANY DUTY OF CARE TO THE USER YOU KNOW EXACTLY EXACTLY GETTING TO CENTER ON BURKE'S POINT- WHICH I THOUGHT WAS IT WAS INTERESTING IS. WHAT EXACTLY DOES A WAIVER OF LIABILITY OFFER IF TORT LAW IS NOT BEING SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED. AND THERE IS A REASON WHY PEOPLE PURSUE IT. THEY PURSUE IT BECAUSE ONE IT'S A GET OUT OF LITIGATION CARTON IT CUT SHORT. WHAT OTHERWISE COULD BE A PROLONGED EXPERIENCE IN THE COURTS ORDERED LENGTHY NEGOTIATIONS ON AND SO FORTH THAT MAKES IT A LOT CLEANER SO I CAN SEE WHY THE ENTITIES. WANT TO PURSUE THAT. AND THEN I GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF IF I WERE TO RENT A BICYCLE. OR SWIMMING EQUIPMENT ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO HAVE. UP A LIABILITY WAIVERS. SO HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT ARE THE HOWEVER THOSE CIRCA. DIFFERENT IN AND IT SHOULD BE APPLIED HERE. I THINK THE BILLING ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. ELEVEN LET ME ASK YOU A CRYSTAL AND WITH IT THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS TO RUSH TO RESPOND AND I CAN FOLLOW SURE GO AHEAD IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND LETTING HIM THAT THAT'S A VERY. VERY GOOD QUESTION FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT A SPORT IT'S MORE IF YOU WERE TO THINK ABOUT A RENTAL CAR. IN A PARKING TRANSPORTATION UNTIL CAR WHEN THEY ASK YOU TO WAIT THERE YOU'RE RIGHT STIFF THE TIRES FELL OFF BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT. TIGHTEN BECAUSE- ON FIRE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THANK YOU WITH NOT AGREE WITH THAT THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO DO. AFTER LEASES IN FRONT. WAIT WHAT WAS SAID BY BIRD WHEN I READ BIRDS PAPANASAM. RIGHT IT. WILL BE BOTH THE MALFUNCTION THE ARMY PAIN AND I'M OUT ON MAY CALL INJURY. RIDERSHIP THANK YOU FOR AND YOU WHAT WE'RE HAVING ON IT IS OR ANYTHING WE CAN OUR T. PAY WE CAN'T HEAR THAT ANSWER IT'S MODELED. IT IS HIS PHONE YEAH FIVE. ALL RIGHT IS THERE ANY CHANCE AND- CAN YOU CAN EITHER GET THE YOUR PHONE IS NOT TRANSMITTING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IS THIS ANY BETTER I'M SORRY IS BETTER THANK YOU HAVE MOVED. WOULD YOU GO AHEAD AND AN OLD FIVE I APOLOGIZE. ALL RIGHT. YES WHEN I WAS READING BIRDS RELEASING WHERE THEY ACTUALLY- I HAVE THE USER SIGN A DOCUMENT SAYING THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE RELEASING THEIR RIGHTS OVER INJURY CAUSED BY THE MACHINERY ITSELF. SAYING THEY UNDERSTAND EVEN THAT MACHINERY IT IS WELL MAINTAINED AND HAIL IN IT THERE FOR THEY THEY ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INJURIES BECAUSE SO. BIRD IN LEFT SEEK TO EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM THEIR OWN DANGEROUS PRODUCTS PRODUCTS IN WRITING IN THEIR RELEASE AGREEMENTS IN STATE THAT THEY GIVE NO WARRANTY AS TO THE FITNESS OF THE PRODUCT. OR ITS INTENDED USE SO THEY'RE WRITTEN TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO SEE COMPENSATION IF THE DEVICE BREAKS CLOSE UP THE WHEELS FALL OFF. THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE IT IN THERE WELL I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE I HEARD THE PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT. YOU CAN'T THROUGH THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION ON DO TORT LAW. AND LIABILITY FOR MECHANICAL FAILURES EXIST NO MATTER WHAT. HOWEVER RELATION IN WORDING. IS IN A WAIVER. WELL THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE YEAH THEY PUT IT IN THERE. THEY'RE SEEKING TO DRAFT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ARE THE RISK OF THE PRODUCT FAILING TO BE PROPERLY MAINTAIN THEIR INSPECTED. THESE PARTICULAR DEVICES I PICKED UP AT NIGHT BY WHAT THEY CALL BIRD CATCHERS OR BLIND USERS WHO ARE JUST PEOPLE WHO BRING THEM HOME. THE MAN AND PUT THEM BACK ON THE STREET THE NEXT DAY THERE'S NO INSPECTION OF THAN THE TO BEING CONDUCTED. IN THEIR WAIVERS WRITTEN SUCH THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ESCAPE LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AND INSPECT THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. SO THEY MAY BE TELLING YOU THERE'S NO WAY THAT THERE IS THEIR WAIVERS. BOB AND THEN YOU HAVE TO THE QUESTION THEN WHY THEY GOTTEN THEM THERE. BUT THEY SEE THE IN TO TRY TO KEEP. FROM BEING HELL. TO BE ABLE TO HOLD RESPONSIBLE WHEN THEY'RE INJURED BY THEIR PRODUCTS OKAY AND THEN. CLOSE OF THANK. IS THERE A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF LITIGATION THAT THESE ENTITIES HAVE PREVAILED OVER INDIVIDUALS THAT WEREN'T ABLE TO EXERCISE TRADITIONAL TOWARD- RIGHTS. I AM NOT AWARE OF. OKAY GO AHEAD MISTER DON THERE'S THAT OVER YET THEIR SON THEY'RE WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE COURTS BECAUSE THESE ARE RELATIVELY NEW BUT THEY'RE THEY HAVE ASSERTED THEIR WAIVERS IN IN LITIGATION. HE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE WHY THEY SEEK TO PRESERVE IT OKAY AND- DO THESE SCOOTERS TO THE DRIVERS HAVE TO ADHERE TO THE RULES OF THE ROAD LIKE THEY WERE A MOTORCYCLE OR A CAR. THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE RULES OF THE ROAD DETECTABLE TO THESE DEVICES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE LOCAL CITIES DO WHEN THEY PASSED THEIR PERMITTING REGULATIONS. IS THEY CAN CREATE ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN BE ON THE SIDE WALK OFF OF THE SIDEWALK BUT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO CONFORM TO THE RULES OF THE VEHICLE CODE. AND RULES IMPOSED BY THE STATE OKAY WELL I GOTTA TELL YOU KNOW I'VE IT THEY ARE REALLY CONVENE THERE THEY CAN BE VERY HELPFUL IN CONGESTED AREAS- I HAVE ALSO SEEN SOME TRULY RECKLESS BEHAVIOR BY SOME OF THE FOLKS. THAT THE YOUTH THAT USE THESE. EITHER WAY IT IS SO ALL I I'LL MY COLUMN HERE. THE IT DOESN'T IT IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE ARE. SEARCHING FOR. PREEMPTIVE LEGISLATION THE ISSUE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE RIGHT ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT ALTHOUGH I THINK THE LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICY I THINK IS APPROPRIATE NON PROVISIONAL ONE- BUT I THINK THE WAIVER ISSUE- IS IT JUST NOT RIGHT AND IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT COVERED RELATED I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS COME BACK IN JANUARY BUT THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL RESPECTFUL OPINION DO YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE. TO K. AGAIN. AT THE SOUNDS LIKE. THE COME ONE IS SOME OF THE RISK AND SO THIS WAY SOME OF SPORT. BANTOCK KEEP THINKING WHEN YOU GO TO A BASEBALL GAME THEY TELL YOU TO GET HIT BY BASEBALL HE WAS SOON THE RISK I DON'T KNOW IF THAT PREVAILS OR NOT. BUT HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS ON THESE VEHICLES THEY'RE TRYING TO. ATTACK HOUSE BY TALKING ABOUT THEM IS A SPORTS VEHICLE. AND WHAT THEY REALLY ARE AND I THINK WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS CLARIFY WHAT THEY REALLY ARE. THERE ARE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION- AND SO- IT WOULD IT'S NOT CHANGING LIABILITY STANDARDS- AND CREATING NEW LAW WHAT IT SAYS YOU CANNOT. APPLY ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK TO THESE VEHICLES AS IF THEY WERE LIKE YOU'RE GOING SKIING OR WHAT HAVE YOU THESE ARE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. AND THEY HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED APPROPRIATE. HAVE TO A- SICK YOU KNOW COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOMEONE WHO'S PUTTING THESE. VEHICLES IF YOU WILL ON THE ROAD AND ACTS OF THE ANALOGY I DON'T THINK CAR MANUFACTURER COULD GET AWAY WITH THAT- AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS NEITHER SHOULD THE- THE SHOULD THESE VEHICLES. ARE IN THEIR NEW PRODUCT I MEAN THEY- THESE MOBILITY DEVICES ARE POPPING UP AND I THINK OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WITH THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS. IDENTIFY CLEARLY WHAT THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS ARE WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE ALL OF THE WAY THEY ARE. HANDLED IN THE WAY. THEY ARE PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC THE FACT THAT THEY'RE PICKED UP AT NIGHT. THE BROUGHT TO SOMEBODY SHOT HOMER WHATEVER IT IS TO A WAREHOUSE AND THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT MAINTAINED WHICH IS GET PUT BACK OUT IN THE STREET AND THERE THEY ARE AND IF SOMEONE GETS INJURED. REDDIT WAIT A IN THE COMPANY. TOUGH TOUGH LUCK AND I THINK WITH THIS TRIES TO DO IS PUT SOME CLARITY ON IT. I'M NOT SURE I MAKE THE CODE CONNECTION. DIRECTLY MYSELF BUT I DO THINK THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE SEEING THESE VEHICLES THESE DEVICES MORE AND MORE IN OUR STREETS THEY DO NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED AND- THEN CATEGORIZE DIDN'T- PLACED WITHIN. YOU KNOW THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS CAN AND SHOULD BE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT I'M WE HAVE ENDED OUR STERN. HE HOW YOU DOING. OKAY THANK YOU CAN I. BECAUSE I WANT TO PIGGY BACK ON THE POINT YOU WERE JUST MAKING MADAM CHAIR AND JUST GET SOME CLARIFICATION OUT OF HE WAS THE GENERAL COUNSEL. OUR STATE TO BIRD MISTER SAID FU. I WAS HOPING TO GET SOME CLARITY ON THAT ASSUMPTION OF RISK QUESTION AND ALSO SOME. SOMETHING THAT. CENTER BORDERS AND I'M BURKE WE'RE GETTING AT IN TERMS OF. WHAT GOOD WHAT NEW CAUSES OF ACTION AT IT CAUSE OF ACTION QUESTION BUT IS HE ON THE LINE STILL COMING JUST CHECK THAT. LANTANA THREE SO THROUGH THE CHAIR OF ITS IF IT IF IT'S ALL RIGHT. MY UNDERSTANDING THE BILL IS THE- YOU YOU WOULD BE DENIED THE ABILITY TO PROACTIVELY WAVES- CERTAIN LIABILITIES BUT THAT YOU WOULD STILL BE PRESERVED THE ABILITY TO RAISE ASSUMPTION OF RISK AS A LEGAL DEFENSE. IS THAT IS THAT ARE YOU READ THIS THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL. SUTTER MADAM CHAIR THAT'S NOT QUITE HOW WE NEED IT. AT THAT RURAL CORRECTLY IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY FROM MY LAW WHAT THE FUNCTION OF IT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE BOTH EXPRESS AND IMPLIED AND IN N. B. EXPRESS. IS A LEGAL DEFENSE AVAILABLE TO ANY OTHER CONSUMER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA BUT WOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE TO US- TO USE THE BASEBALL GAME ANALOGY BEFORE YOU KNOW IT IT IT IS COMMON THAT WHEN YOU GO TO A BASEBALL GAME YOU ASSUME THE RISK. OF A OF A BASEBALL STRIKE YOU. BUT BUT BUT WHAT WHAT THERE ISN'T IS A RULE THAT THAT THAT THE DODGERS ALONE CAN'T HAVE THEIR USED HAVE HAD THEIR CUSTOMERS SIGN SUCH A WAIVER BUT TO DO IT BUT THE GIANTS BUT IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS A TIME TO MAKE. CHANGES TO SOME SERVICE DR PROMOTE THE TRANSPORT I THINK ARGUED THAT IT SHOULD APPLY EQUALLY TO IT TO ALMOST TRANSPORT BECAUSE I TRIED TO GET EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE STATE CHANGE A LOT ABOUT ON THE BOARDWALK BUT WHAT IT DOES CHANGES THE SCOPE OF WHAT. WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE INCLUDED IN IT IN A USER AGREEMENT- AND I BELIEVE MISTER DILLON AT LITTLE BIT EARLIER WHAT VALUE THERE WEREN'T ACTUALLY WERE FROM THE REGION AND I THINK OF THAT AND I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT THE FINANCIAL REALITIES OPERATE ANY. BUSINESS YEAH. WILL BE A RISK AND AVOID AT ALL. TROLL ON THE WAIVER FOR ARE ONE OF THE KEY TOOL FOR CONSUMER EIGHT AND TO ENSURE THAT IN THAT WHY THEY ARE BUT I EVERY CONCERT INDUSTRY GALA. AND I IN I AND OUR OBJECT TO THE BILL THEM FROM FACT THAT WE WOULD BE ONLY INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA DENIED THAT LEGAL PROTECTION. SO DO DO THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO KEEP EXERCISING THAT WAIVER AS YOU CAN UNDER CURRENT LAW. D. PERTAIN TO THOSE. WHEN THIRD PARTIES THAT. I FORGET WHAT THAT MEANS THE AUTHOR OR MISTER DOLAN REFERRED TO THEM AS BUT THAT DOES YOU SORT OF. PICK UP THE DEVICE. STORE OVERNIGHT CHU SUM UP. IS THAT HAVE YOU HAVE YOU APPLIED THE WAIVER IN CIRCUMSTANCES WORST MAYBE DAVE ACTED NEGLIGENTLY. IS THAT THE SORT OF PRIMARY CONCERN WHEN YOU SAY OUT OF YOUR CONTROL IS THAT REALLY WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. YEP YEP CENTER THAT'S RIGHT THAT WE WILL ALL RIGHT NOW- LET LITIGATION THAT ARISES OUT OF THOSE. CIRCUMSTANCES FOR INSTANCE A RECKLESS RIDERS OR ANOTHER CAR ON THE STREET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ARE IS THE FACT THAT WE IT IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE CLOSED BY A WEIGHT BYE BYE BYE THE WAIVER PROVISIONS IN THE AGREEMENT. THE SAME WAY THAT THE WAIVER PROVISIONS AND OTHER- INDUSTRY FOR CLOSE THOSE. FOUR FOUR CLOSE LITIGATE. WITH AB PROBABLY. ARE CONCERNED THAT THOSE THOSE CASES BECOME FAR. NO REQUIRE A LOT MORE LITIGATION IN ORDER TO RESULT IN WALL THE ULTIMATE JUDGMENT MIGHT AND YOU NOT BE A RADICALLY ULTIMATELY END UP IN THE SAME PLACE THE REALITY IS THAT BETWEEN. DIFFERENCE DEAL WITH A LITTLE GRAYSON AND NOT IS REPRESENTS NEXT THREE NOT ONLY ARE INDUSTRY TWENTY INDUSTRY THAT WOULD HAVE TO- ABOUT THAT WE HAVE THE CHILDREN THAT KIND OF RISK FOR WORKING OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL UNDERSTOOD MAYBE CHEROKEE MAYBE YOU OR THE AUTHOR IN HIS CLOTHES COULD JUST CLARIFY SOME SUPER CLEAR ABOUT WHAT I'M VOTING ON HERE BUT I THINK I HEARD FROM- MISTER FU IS THAT. YEAH STILL DO. PRESERVE THAT DEFENSE ASSUMPTION OF RISK. BUT THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO IMPOSE THIS WAIVER. SOME ADDITIONAL SORT OF LITIGATION RISK THAT. THE NOT QUITE I MEAN IT'S HE DIED HE GAVE THEM EXAMPLES OF RECKLESSNESS I WAS TALKING ABOUT THESE THIRD PARTY PRACTICES AT THE JUICERS OR WHOEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE STILL UTILIZING THOSE SERVICES BUT- I THINK THE THING THAT SENATOR IS THAT THIS DOESN'T CREATE ANY GREATER LIABILITY. AND IT DOESN'T DENY THEM THE RIGHT TO DEFEND- FOR STANDARD TORT LAW SO IF THERE'S NEGLIGENCE BY THE USER THAT'S A DEFENSE. SO BASICALLY ALL IT DOES IS SAY YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND THIS WAIVER. AND SAY THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOUR LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY ORANGE BECAUSE OF THIS WAIVER. I MEAN THAT'S THE THAT'S AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL THAT THE WAIVERS- ARE. IT SORT OF. NOT ALLOWED THERE IF THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY- UNCONSCIONABLE POTENTIALLY OR AT LEAST PARTS OF THEM SO RATHER THAN LET THEM DO IT AND HAVE THEM BE FOUND UNCONSCIONABLE THIS BILL SAYS HE CAN'T HIDE BEHIND WHAT IS AN UNCONSCIONABLE WAVE YOU CAN ASSERT WHATEVER CLAIMS YOU HAVE INFORMAL TOWARD LAW. THOSE SERVICE THE ARE STILL FOR YOU. THAT ESSENTIALLY IS I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BILL DOES AND PERHAPS IN YOUR CLOTHES ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU CAN CLARIFY FIVE MISUNDERSTOOD IT. BUT IS THAT HELP AT ALL SENATOR YES. SIR STERN WE GET. YES IT DOES THANK OKAY GREAT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. SENATOR THE RAZA. THANK YOU YOU GUYS ARE ALSO SMART YOU TOOK MY QUESTIONS BUT- I JUST WHAT SORT OF LEAD YOU TO A CURIOUS AS TO WHAT LED YOU TO WANNA PROPOSE LEGISLATION LIKE THIS AND- I KNOW I'VE BEEN IN SOME CITIES WHERE IT'S VERY POPULAR AND THEY'RE JUST. THROWN ALL OVER THE SIDEWALKS YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU WALK SO- THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE ALTHOUGH I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING. BUT IT SEEMS THAT. THESE NEW IDEAS. ARE IN ARE DONE FIRST AND THEN WE'RE SORT OF REACTING AND RESPONDING LATER TO WHAT WITH WHERE THE RULES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND THEN YOU INTRODUCE IT WITH A LOT MORE RESPONSIBILITY BUT- MY QUESTION IS. WHAT WAS IF YOU CAN GIVE EXAMPLES OF WHAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE. THAT EITHER CITIES OR COUNTIES HAD. THAT LED YOU TO WANNA. INTRODUCE THIS LEGISLATION- YEAH THAT'S IT BASICALLY THANK YOU SENATOR SO. THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE DEVICES OVERNIGHT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT- IN CITIES LIKE REDONDO BEACH AND MANHATTAN BEACH- SUDDENLY. THESE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES APPEARED ON THE SIDEWALKSAND- THEY LEAD TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS- FROM RESIDENTS. ECKLEY SENIORS CENTER BARGES- IT TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THAT COULD BE IF THEY'RE LEFT ON THE SIDEWALKS IT RESTRICTS ACCESS FOR SENIORS WHICH IS WHY THE A. R. P. SUPPORTS THIS BILL. YOU KNOW MAY RESTRICT ACCESS TO THE TO THE TO THOSE WITH DISABILITIES WHICH IS WHY THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA- ORGANIZATION SUPPORTS THIS BILL- I THINK IT IT JUST MAKES SENSE LIKE YOU. SAID CENTER THAT TO YOU KNOW RATHER THAN WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH UP TO THIS INDUSTRY THAT DECIDED THAT THEY JUST WANT TO ROLL OUT- WITHOUT- ANY- PUBLIC SAFETY REGULATIONS- IN PLACE AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH UP. TO MAKE SURE THAT- WHEN THE ESSENTIAL NEEDS TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL TO TAKE CARE OF A COVERT. YOU KNOW THEY THEY WOULD. TO SERVE A BILL DEVICE OF THEY NEED TO. YOU KNOW PUT THE IT IS THE- IN. WELL MY GOOD ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS GOOD ALL RIGHT ANY QUESTIONS. THE CENTER I'M BURKE NO ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT A SINISTER IS YOUR HAND STILL UP. NO OKAY ALL RIGHT I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE- B. THE DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL- AND AGAIN- AS MADAM CHAIR AS YOU. BOB POINTED OUT ON SEVERAL. CATIONS THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE TORT LAW THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE PROVIDERS THEY STILL HAVE THE SAME DEFENSES WHETHER IT'S ASSUMPTION OF RISK- OR ANY OTHER. LEGAL DEFENSES- IN AND THEY CAN THEY CAN CONTINUE TO ASSERT THEM I'M- FRANKLY DISAPPOINTED WITH SOME OF THE RHETORIC USE BY THE REPRESENTED FROM BIRD I MEAN THIS SHOULD NOT AND IS NOT INTENDED TO. TO BE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE MICROBIAL OF THE INDUSTRY. AGAIN WE HAVE MANY REASONS TO SUPPORT. THIS INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE. YOU KNOW THERE BUT THERE'S NOT THERE SHOULD BE A QUESTION LIKE IT. OUR USER OF A E. SCOOTER IS. AND THE- YOU KNOW THEY THEY- HI I TRY TO USE- PER DEVICE IN A NEGLIGENT MANNER I MEAN BIRD CAN SUE THE RIDER- IT AGAIN IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN TERMS OF EXISTING TORT LAW AND EGGS IN TERMS OF EXISTING DEFENSES- I. WANT TO MAKE THAT EMPHASIS LAST BUT NOT LEAST YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT WE TREAT THIS AS FOR WHAT IT IS AS A- IMPORTANT MODE OF TRANSIT TRANSPORTATION MODE OF TRANSPORTATION THAT MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR- THIS SHOULD BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE POPULAR IF THEY CAN CUT DOWN ON CAR TRIPS. ON ON EMISSIONS- AND AFFORDABLE WAY- WE WANT TO PROMOTE THAT BUT IN IN A SAFE WAY THAT PROVIDES FOR BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND FOR THOSE REASONS I ASKED FOR I GOT. TO HAVE A MOTION THE MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR. SENATOR DORADO SENATOR ALSO MOVES. BY MADAME A CONSULTANT WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL A SENATORS PLEASE TURN YOUR MICROPHONES ON THIS IS FILE ITEM LINE AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX MARTUCCI.

OKAY BURGESS THANK YOU KNOW PORTIS NOW DON'T KNOW THE RUSSELL I THE RUSSELL BY GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ HI MELENDEZ. NO MELENDEZ NO MORNING I MONNING AYE STERN. STERN NINE STERN I- BURKE- BERG I WAKE CAL SKI HI MY CASKEY I THAT SEVEN TWO TWO SEVEN TWO TWO- THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI THAT WAS MUCH SHORTER THAN THE FIRST ITEM AND NOW WE'LL GO TO FILE ITEM THREE AND SEE IF WE CAN. CONTINUE OUR- THE MOMENTUM HERE. GIVE ME JUST A SECOND TO. ENOUGH REUSING AGREES TO DELIVER. MONDAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HOPEFULLY THIS IS QUICK BECAUSE IT IS A SIMPLE BILL M. IN VERY COVERT RELATED. DISCUSSION THERE THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS IS COVERED RELATED ADS WE KNOW PEOPLE BECOME INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON ON FOOD DELIVERY SERVICES BOTH RESTAURANTS AND INDIVIDUALS AT HOME DURING THIS PERIOD HOWEVER WE'VE ALSO NOW FOUND OUT- THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE THAT THERE ARE RESTAURANTS WHO HAVE NOT AGREED TO BE PART OF THIS DELIVERY SYSTEM AND HAVE HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THEIR SMALL BUSINESS AS A RESULT- FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A HAVING SOMETHING ORDERED FROM YOUR RESTAURANT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEING ORDERED FROM A DELIVERY SERVICE. SOMETIMES THAT DELIVERY SERVICE CAN POSIT BE DELIVERED LATE WRONG IT COULD BE THE WRONG ORDER IT. YOU CALPERS MORALS GO DOWN BE THE CUT THINK THAT YOU ARE IN OUR THIS DELIVERY SERVICE. SO ALL THIS SAYS IS SIMPLY THAT THERE HAS TO BE AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY AND THE FOOD FACILITY. IN ORDER FOR A FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY TO. PARTAKE IN DELIVERING THOSE SERVICES- WE DID A LOT OF DIFFERENT ITERATIONS TO SEE HOW WE COULD DO THIS BILL I KNOW THAT. THERE IS GREAT. NOW SAYS ABOUT THINGS PROBABLY NEED TO COME BACK AND STRENGTHEN IT UP WITH BUT THIS IS WHAT. TODAY IN A RESERVE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ONE OF. THAT IS THE BALLPARK. ONE BY THE CALIFORNIA RIGHT ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND YOU DON'T GET THAT OFTEN. IT IS TRUE SO FUNDS CLEAR. CHINGLISH TO THIS FILE UP I'M THREE AB TWENTY ONE FORTY BY ASSEMBLY CONSULT ON FOOT. PLAQUE AT. CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION ON THE LINE YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS A AN INTERESTING COLLABORATION BUT- IF MISTER SUTTON YOU ARE ON THE LINE AND THERE ARE NO OTHER WITNESSES YOU HAVE UP TO FOUR MINUTES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE METS THAT MOVIE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION JUST WANT TO VERIFY YOU CAN HEAR ME APOLOGIES WE CAN HEAR YOU. EXCELLENT THANK YOU THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU DO AT THE MOMENT IN DOLLARS FOR ALL THREE OF THE TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE AND SHE CLEARLY SAID THIS IS ABOUT RECEIVING PERMISSION FROM A RESTAURANT PRIOR TO DELIVERING THE FOOD. ON OUR BEHALF. BUT ME THANK YOU TO COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLE JUST GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE WE AGREE HOWEVER THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SO MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS. THIS PROBLEM WAS A PROBLEM BEFORE COVERED NINETEEN AND IT WILL BE A PROBLEM AFTER COCONUT GENE AND NOT SAY BE TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE- MOVES FORWARD TO FIX ISSUE. THE RESTAURANT'S. MENUS OTHER ITEMS WITHOUT PERMISSION THE REST. AND DELIVERING THAT TO DISCUSS. ALSO WITHOUT. IN UNKNOWN TO OUR MEMBERS THIS TYPE BAY TRACK. PROBABLY HELPS TO APPS DRIVE. TO PLOT. BUT FOR RESTAURANTS IT CREATES CONFUSION DINNERTIME BRAND INDUSTRY OUT. SOME CASES THIRTY HOW A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF THEIR OWN. IN TURN. THE MENU LIST ON ANOTHER. GOOD BYE. INTEGRATES MESSAGING FROM THE REST AND DELIVERY. SHOWS UP. THE CUSTOMER AND DRIVER REST AND LIVES THE IF THE CUSTOMER. DOES NOT GET THEIR FOOD SOMETIMES. DON'T GET. AND THE RESTAURANT REPEAT DAN. ANOTHER IN ITS FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM MIGHT POST. A LOGO NOW DATA MENU AND CHANCES ARE. IF WE DON'T KNOW THAT. WE CAN'T ENSURE ACCURATE SERVICE TO THAT GUEST. WE CAN'T PROTECT THE RESTAURANT REPUTATION WHEN THIRD PARTIES ARE DELIVERING OUR PRODUCT THE FOOD. BUT THAT ARE NOT YOU CAN. NINE THREE BEEN AMENDED TO THE APPROACH TO FIX THE THIS PROBLEM IN SAYS. YOU GOTTA HAVE TO IF YOU'RE GONNA DO FOR FROM A RESTAURANT VIA A THIRD PARTY FOR. WHAT TO DO PLATFORM I ON THE OF THE REST EMPLOYEE. THAT PARTNERSHIP THE TWO AND- NOT ALL TO DELIVER PRACTICE. ARE TAKING SUCH. IMPRESSED TACKED TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS. JUNK FOOD PROCTOR ARE ACTS TRUE PART WITH RESTAURANTS. WE WILL ALL FOOD DELIVERY SHOULD COMMIT PARTNERSHIP THAT ARE HUGE BENEFIT. IT'LL RESTORE THAT ACT BACK INTO THE RELAY. I THINK AB TWENTY ONE FORTY IS FACT THAT HELP TO SKILLED EQUITY TOWARD THE LOCAL RESTAURANTS WHICH I YOUR END VALUE TO THE STATE'S OVER REST YOU. THAT IS PROUD TO BOAST THE THANK YOU FOR OF HELP REST ARE OWNED PEOPLE OF COLOR THE REST COMMUNITY AT LEAST PRIOR TO. THEY'RE INTENTIONAL UNAUTHORIZED DELIVERY OF OUR PRODUCTS FOOD HELPS DRIVE INCREMENTAL SALES FOR RESTAURANTS AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL. I RESPOND IS THERE A TIME THAT YOU CRIMINAL STALE VALUE IS COMPLETELY OUTWEIGHED BY THE REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE UNAUTHORIZED HANDLING AND DELIVERY OF OUR FOOD. AND THE CONSUMER IS UNDERSTANDABLY INCORRECTLY ABSENT WITH THE RESTAURANT FOR THE CORE PERFORMANCE OF THE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY KITTY. YOU LIKE HERE THAT THEY WILL THREATEN TO PULL THEIR FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE OUT OF EXISTING SERVICE TERRITORY. SPOTS WOULD BE THE TRUE DELIVERY PLATFORMS AND BEEN VERY PUBLIC THAT- DELIVERY SIDE OF THINGS IS THE BEST HOPE FOR THESE PLATFORMS TO BECOME PROFITABLE IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT. SO IT'S I THEIR SELF INTEREST TO CONTINUE TO SERVE. THAT THEY CURRENTLY DO IN CALIFORNIA. FINALLY THE STAFF ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE OPPONENTS CLAIM AB TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE IS BAD FOR RESTAURANTS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR STONE HUSBAND DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR INTERNET APPLICATIONS- I A THE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER FORTY OF.

BUT WHILE THE BILL SURELY WELL INTENTIONED WE BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE DIRECT CONSEQUENCES FOR RESTAURANTS ARE FOR DELIVERY PLATFORMS AND CONSUMERS ALIKE. ARE COMING UNNECESSARY HARM DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL. THAT'S RESTAURANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA CLOSE THE DOORS TO DINE IN CUSTOMERS MANY TURN TO OUR FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS TO OFFER DELIVERY SERVICE ENGINE OPTIONS AND IT WILL. DELIVERED GLAD RESTROOM OFFERDELIVERY WITH HAVING HIGH AND DRY OR- THEIR OWN DELIVER SUCH. AND MANY RESTAURANTS TALIBAN BUT THEY FOR ALL DELIVERY THROUGH OUR CLASS WITHOUT A FORMAL. WHICH ALLOWS THEM PLAY TROUT. AND MANY ON BLOCK ON PLATFORMS OR TO BETWEEN CLASS PARTIES. HOWEVER IT YOU TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE AND A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH REQUIRING ONE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESTAURANTS AND POP UPS. THE MEDIA IMPACT OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. WE CAN POPULOUS RANDOLPH FROM DELIVERY- UNTIL FORMAL AGREEMENT CAN BE MADE- BUT WE THINK THAT'S CREATES UNNECESSARY DISARRAY FURNITURE THAT'S STILL REELING FROM THE PANDEMIC. I'M ALWAYS OF THE PROFIT MARGINS ARE YOU TIRED OF CARMEL LAST COULD BE DISASTROUS FOR RESTAURANTS. TRYING TO KEEP IT OPEN. PRESSURE TO COME. COMPETITORS FOLLOW FUTURE GET NEGOTIATED ARE PLATFORMS WILL DO THEIR BEST FOR. OUT OF THESE AGREEMENTS CORPORATE. BY IT'S LIKELY TO CRITICAL A REQUIRED FOR EXAMPLE AT THE START OF PANDEMIC OUR PROBLEM RECEIVED QUESTION. OF RESTAURANTS TRY AND BUY. FOR OUR DELIVERY SERVICE. THANKS I COULD NOT HAVE A BUYING A DIFFICULT SAY HOW LONG THE PROCESS TO. DISAGREEMENTS WITH BUT I ANY DELAYS WILL CAUSE RESTAURANTS WEBER I FINALLY WE BELIEVE. THE BILL DEFINITION OF COULD FACILITY IS A BROAD TO ADDRESS THE ASSURING WE RESPECT COMPANY NARROW TO ACQUIRE A WINDOW. ONTO NATIONAL. BOASTED AND- THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT- RIVER. PARK. AB TWENTY. NINE I STILL BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL CREATE DETRIMENTAL CONSEQUENCES TO RESTAURANTS ARE PLATFORMS THE CUSTOMERS WHO RELY ON THEM. IT'S NO SECRET CODE NINETEEN IS IMPACTED EVERY INDUSTRY BUT AS NOTED BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BUT HAD A- DEVASTATING IMPACT ON RESTAURANTS PARTICULARLY FOR FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANT. STAY HOME ORDERS CREATED A GREAT NEED FOR RESTAURANTS TO REACH CUSTOMERS WHO NO LONGER WALK THROUGH THEIR DOORS. THIRD PARTY DELIVERY PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN THERE TO HELP BRIDGE CUSTOMERS TO RESTAURANTS STRUGGLING TO STAY OPEN. AS OUTLINED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION THE ABILITY TO PARTNER EITHER FORMALLY INFORMED ME WHAT THE DELIVERY PLATFORM EXPANDED. STRUNG OUT. BY THE AMERICAN AFTER. AND I. DELIVERY OPTION WITHOUT THE- INTENSIVE BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH FLEET ACQUISITION. WITHOUT A FORMAL AGREEMENT WHICH SOME RESTAURANTS PREFERRED RESTAURANTS CAN SEAMLESSLY TAKE ORDERS FROM ONE PLATFORM TO ANOTHER EFFORTLESSLY WITHOUT ANY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION OR LIMITATION. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE WOULD PUT THIS PREFERENCE IN JEOPARDY IN APPLY UNIFORMED APPROACH THAT MAY GO AGAINST YOUR RESTAURANTS PREFERENCE. THE AFFIRMATIVE EXPRESS CONSENT CONNECT THEM OUTLINED IN THE BILL COULD CREATE A DEVASTATING LINE BETWEEN WHAT RESTAURANTS ARE DROPPED FROM PLATFORM SO WHEN THEY CAN BE ADDED BACK ONTO THE PLATFORM. WHICH COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RESTAURANTS STAYING OPEN OR CLOSING THEIR DOORS FOREVER. PLATFORMS WOULD LIKE. TO TRY TO HELP ALLEVIATE THESE CHALLENGES BUT AN EDITION OF EVERY RESTAURANT IN THE STATE SEEKING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CONTENT WILL BE UNDOUBTEDLY CREATE DELAYS IN RESPONSE NEXT. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITHOUT- LET'S GO TO WITNESSES. WHO ARE GOING TO JUST SIMPLY IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AND THEIR AFFILIATION. WHETHER ANY OF THOSE WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE IN OPPOSITION. TO AB TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE. ALL RIGHT SEEING. NO ONE. LET'S GO THEN TO- ROOM ONE TWELVE THERE'S NOBODY IN ROOM ONE TWELVE SO LET'S. BRING IT TO THE PHONES AGAIN- WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE QUEUE UP ANYONE WHO WISHES TO GIVE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE. IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION YOU MAY PRESS ONE MIN ZERO. DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN THE QUEUE MODERATOR. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME- LET'S WAIT ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD I'VE GOT A FEW COMMENTS. AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE QUEUE. WE HAVE NO ONE IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT WELL FIRST OF ALL THE RECENT AMENDMENTS SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR- THE IDEA OF THIS BILL IS TO REQUIRE A RESTAURANTS CONSENT. FOR FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE CAN ARRANGE FOR THE DELIVERY OF THE RESTAURANTS FOOD. THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHED IT BY FORBIDDING THE POSTING OF MANY TRADEMARK INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THE RESTAURANT. BY THE SERVER DELIVERY SERVICE WITHOUT THE RESTAURANTS. THIS KIND OF CAR DID IN IT WAS BY THE OPPOSITION COULD BE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO. WORK THROUGH- IS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT TRADEMARK AND COPYRIGHT LAW SO S. AMENDED A FEW DAYS AGO AND THANK YOU TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETIMES SIMPLE. SIMPLE IS BETTER- THE BILL SIMPLY PROHIBITS PRO PROHIBITS ARRANGING FOR THE DELIVERY OF A RESTAURANTS FOOD WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. SIMPLE IT'S A DIRECTED I THINK GOOD OLD FASHION REGULATION OF A AN ABUSIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. ARE TICKETS INTERESTED OUT OF THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SUPPORTERS AND THE TECH INDUSTRY SIZZLE RESTAURANTS ARE GOING TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. THE SOMETHING IS A LITTLE OFF AND IF STRESS THEY WERE GONNA GET THE BUSINESS I SUSPECTED MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IS THEY'RE VERY VOCAL AND WOULD BE HERE IN OPPOSITION. BUT IN FACT PORT SO- WELL THIS BILL I FOR SEEK A REST CONCERTS BEFORE YOU PROF OFF THEIR PRODUCT AND WHY- IS IN THIS BEING DONE ALREADY- THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE COMPLICATED. I THINK IS- IS CHESTER. INACCURATE THE BILL THE FOOD FACILITY EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZING THE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM TO TAKE OR IN DELIVER MEALS PREPARED BY THE FACILITY. THE TECH JUST SINCE IN WRITING THAT'S UP TO SAY. AND THEN EMAIL ACTUALLY COULD COULD SATISFY THIS REQUIREMENT THERE'S NO FORMALITIES REQUIRED- THE POINT IS THIS IS NOT AN ONEROUS REQUIREMENT- AND THE LAPSES SERVICE ARGUMENT AS I INDICATED IF THERE WAS REALLY GOING TO BE A LAPSE OF SERVICE THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY WOULD BE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. JUST SIMPLY OF THESE PLATFORMS FROM WHAT I HAVE GATHERED A MOVEMENT WHICH I'VE HEARD IN MY OWN COMMUNITY IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT MOST OF THE PROFIT GOES TO THE A PLATFORM TO THE DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT AND REST. COOLEY THEIR PROFIT WHICH IS- ANYWAY IS REDUCED EVEN MORE DRAMATIC. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE TO. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT UNLESS THE RESTAURANT KNOWS THAT THERE'S SOMEONE ACTUALLY DOING THIS ON THEIR PLATFORM THEY HAVE NOBODY TO NEGOTIATE WITH. SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING PARTICULARLY ARE SMALLER BUSINESSES. LARGE CHAINS MIGHT HAVE BARGAINING POWER AND LEVERAGE BUT- SMALL BUSINESSES ARE REALLY AT THE MERCY OF THESE COMPANIES AND- THIS BILL ELIMINATES CONDUCTANCE OF BENEFIT BETTER AFTER SEN. I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF THIS WERE TREADING NEW GROUND BECAUSE THESE PLATFORMS IN THE WHOLE. IDEA OF THE INTERNET AND IN PLATFORM. CONDUCTING CUSTOMERS IS NEW. THE TECH INDUSTRY TESTS INTO BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA THEY BE ABLE TO. IT AND- BUT- THESE ARE NOT IN THE SUPPOSED TO BE PREDATORY INDUSTRIES AND PREDATORY A COMPANIES- THERE ARE CERTAIN THAT KIND OF RULES OF FAIRNESS AND CONTRACT IN IN WHAT HAVE YOU THAT STILL NEED TO BE ABIDED BY EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE THESE NEW KINDS OF CONCEPTS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL. INDICATES IT IS RESTORE SOME EQUITY IN BARGAINING POWER AND THINGS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL I WOULD SUBMIT TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE FOR THIS MARVELOUS FREE MARKET KEEP PUSHING FOR THIS IS HOW A FUNCTIONING FREE MARKET CANS FIVE BY ALLOWING RESTAURANTS. TO OPT INTO THE PROGRAM. BELONGS AND THAT'S WITH THE ENTITY THAT'S PRODUCING ALL OF THE VALUE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP AND- AS SOMEONE WHO. EATS OUT FREQUENTLY AND TAKES OUT FREQUENTLY- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WONDERFUL LOCAL RESTAURANTS STAY IN BUSINESS AND ARE ABLE TO THRIVE COVERT. OR NO COVERED. AND THERE'S A CONNECTION ERROR SEVEN. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT- THE BILL ANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR CASKEY SENATOR BORJAS HAS A QUESTION. THANK YOU SOMEONE I'D I WAS CURIOUS ON HOW THIS WAS GOING TO PLAY OUT AND I'VE I'VE LEARNED QUITE A FEW THINGS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE ABOUT THIS. OP FOR EXAMPLE THE STAFF REPORT INDICATED THAT- THE ONLINE PLATFORMS WHICH I BELIEVE PROVIDE A FANTASTIC SERVICE AND REMARKABLY THERE IS A COOKIE CONNECTION HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE USING ONLINE FOOD PURCHASING- PUTS MORE THAN THEY DID BEFORE BUT I DID NOT KNOW THEY COULD MODIFY THE PRICES. WAS KIND OF NEW TO. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. MAY THAT WAS REFLECTED IN THE PRICE OF THE FOOD AND- THE FOLKS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN DELIVERY- PERSON THERE- I CAN SEE HOW THIS WOULD CREATE HAVOC HAVING WORKED IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY FOR MANY MANY YEARS I CAN EASILY SEE HOW THIS THING GETS A LITTLE WEIRD- SO JUST TWO QUESTIONS. THE AGREEMENT THAT YOU TALK ABOUT. IT THAT IS UP TO THE PARTIES TO CREATE IS THAT CORRECT EXACTLY ANNA AS THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTED COULD BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS AN AFFIRMATIVE OPT IN BY THE RESTAURANT IN AN EMAIL OKAY THAT IS HELPFUL THE OTHER. FOOD FACILITY IS DEFINED IN STATUTE. I BELIEVE SUPERMARKET IS AS WELL THIS ONLY PERTAINS TO RESTAURANTS AT THE STATE THIS PERTAINS TO FOOD FACILITIES SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE LINES ARE BLURRED HONOR IF YOU GO TO MY LOCAL SUPERMARKET YOU SEE THAT THEY ALSO SERVE HALF INCH SECTION. FOR HOT FOOD HOT FOOD DELIVERIES I THINK IT WOULD THAT BE CONFUSING FOR US TO START PICKING CHOOSING WHAT FOODS FACILITY IS AN OBVIOUS BONDS AS- IN A THEIR DEFINITION RIGHT NOW. SO SIMP IT YOU KNOW THE SERVICES YOU YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM BY THE WAY WITH WITH THAT SUPERMARKETS WHO ALSO HAVE DELIVERY ASPECTS IN IT IS DEALING WITH THE SITUATION AS WELL SAM. JUST REQUIRES AN OPT IN I MEAN IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT ONEROUS- SITUATION AND MOST. BIG COMPANIES. RT HAVE CAUGHT PLACE. THE IS COLLECTION IS A FOOD FACILITY IS TO FIND. BUT ELSEWHERE IN THE CODE SUPERMARKETS ARE DEFINED ELSEWHERE. IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING I DON'T THINK WE SAID WE- NOT THEY'RE TAUGHT IN YOUR BILL L. WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK TO BE HONEST BUT I DIDN'T HAVE AN INTENTION OF. DEFINING ARE SEPARATING THE BUT I CAN GO BACK AND I'LL CHECK ON THAT I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE A DEFINITION FOR ME I THINK THAT WAS THAT WAS MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT. IT BROAD WITH THIS GOING. BY THE RESTAURANTS I'M ALL IN ABSOLUTELY ALL AND I'M LOOKING TURN ABOUT SUPERMARKET ANGLE- I THINK THE OPTING IN. IS NOT A BAD THING I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT IS A SMART THING TO DO AND IT ALLOWS FOLKS JUST TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING THEMSELVES INTO AND- CREATES THAT RELATIONSHIP. BUT I GUESS- I DO. M.'S REALLY GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT- MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT. YOU ADD CLARIFICATION WHEN IT COMES TO THE BACK DOOR. THAT SUPERMARKETS ARE NOT INCLUDED UNDER THE DEFINITION OF FOOD FACILITY. I WILL I WILL CHECK ON THAT THANK YOU I WAS NOT ATTEMPTING TO DEFINE FOOD FACILITY SO. THIS. THANK YOU IS RUNNING FOR ANYTHING ELSE WE DO HAVE A MOTION WAS OUR MOTION MADE BY SENATOR Y. CASKEY. I THINK. IF YOU GO TO PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS THERE IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE FOOD FACILITY ISN'T GOING FORWARD SUGGESTING TO THE AUTHOR THAT SHE MAKE SURE THIS DEFINITION. IS CONSISTENT WITH YOUR EXPECTATIONS. HI FORGET OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR Y. CASKEY THE MOTION IS DUE PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD THINK ILL- OBVIOUSLY COVERED RELATED I WILL GET AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION AND THEN WE MAY LIKE THE OUTCOME OF WILL DEFINITELY GET UNANSWERED. IN ALL HONESTY I DO. END BECAUSE I'VE NOW FELT. SO IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IF I CAN EVEN SAY THAT MY LIFE SO I WANT TO END WITH THIS WEEK YES RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SHOULD SPEAK FOR ASTRONAUTS JUST LIKE UNIONS AND WORKER ADVOCATES SHOULD SPEAK FOR WORKERS. IN TECH MAKES IT SPEAKS FOR THE PLATFORM COMPANIES THAT THEY'RE SPEAKING FOR AND IF WE JUST ABIDED BY THOSE RIPPLES IN ALL OF OUR DISCUSSIONS I THINK WE GET A LOT MORE DONE AND HAVE A LOT FOR YOUR- WITH THAT. I AM ACTUALLY ASKED FOR AN. THE ROUTE IS THE WAY TO GO AND SO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK YOUR STATS HARD WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU IN WITH THAT. MOTION TO PASS THE SENATE FLOOR MADAM. THE CONSULTANT WOULD YOU GO AHEAD AND CALL THE ROLL- SENATORS PLEASE TURN YOUR MICROPHONES ON THIS IS FILE ITEM. THREE AB TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE. BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR. SEN HI JACKSON HI BURGESS HI BRIDGES I DID ALSO HI GET US SO I GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I MELINDA'S. MORNING STERN CAROLINE STERN I AM BURKE HI BERG I WAKE CAL SKI BY. I SEVEN TWO ZERO AND TWO ARE MISSING SO WORLD YES WILL WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND NOW FOR OUR GRAND FINALE. THIS IS OUR LAST BUILDING ANOTHER HUMDINGER. OF THIS CALL. THIS IS FILE ITEM EIGHT THIS IS AB THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE- AND- THERE ARE AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE ON PAGES TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE COMMON SEVEN ARETHOSE GOING TO BE TAKEN NOW OR- DOES IT I AM HAPPY TO THE MOMENTS GREAT VERY GOOD ALL RIGHT SALUTE STONE PLEASE FEEL FREE. THANK YOU SENATORS I HOPE MEASURE ONE THANK YOUR STAFF FOR AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS. THE BILL IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY SIMPLE BUT THE CONCEPTS ARE NOT AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STRICT LIABILITY. IN THE PRODUCT DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS SITUATION BLOG GOES BACK A NUMBER OF YEARS GOES BACK DECADES AND HAS REALLY BEEN FAIRLY CLEAR AND SETS UP STANDARDS THAT COMPANIES HAVE OPERATED BY AND THRIVE BY. FOR THOSE DECADES INSTRUCTABLE E. WAS USED AND THE NOTION IS TO ENSURE. THAT WHEN A PRODUCT IS SOLD IN THE CALIFORNIA AND SOMEONE IS INJURED. BUT THERE IS A REMEDY. BUT IN THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH ONLINE RETAILERS THESE MARKET PLACES THAT GET CREATED THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TO BLUR THOSE LINES. SO THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING THE SAME LEVEL OF LIABILITY THAT BRICK AND MORTAR. COMPANIES TO COME INTO OUR EXISTING. WHO HAVE OR- HAVE A SIDE CUSTOMERS GO TO THEM AND EXPECT TO BE PROTECTED FROM DANGEROUS PRODUCTS. SOTHE IN THE SITUATION OF THESE ONLINE MARKETPLACES BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THAT LIABILITY AND IN FACT. HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AGAINST THE BRICK AND MORTAR THE LOCAL STORES IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THEY THEN OR OR EGGS EXERCISING THAT ADVANTAGE IN IN REALLY LEAVING CONSUMERS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. IN THE LURCH SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS JUST TO CREATE. ONLINE MARKETPLACES. TO RETAILERS AND RETAILERS WHO CARRY THAT LIABILITY AS RETAILERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COURTS HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT WOULD THAT THAT STRICT LIABILITY IS A PRE HERE TO ENSURE THAT IT INJURED HAS AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY. AND THAT RETAILER THEN ALSO HAS RECOURSE KIND OF UP THAT CHAIN OF DISTRIBUTION. SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CREATE THE SAME SITUATION AND ENSURE THAT WE THEN HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT AS NEW BUSINESS MODELS COME OUT. THIS IS STANDARD STILL CAN BE ADOPTED IN SEEN BY THE COURTS AND APPLIED BY THE COURTS. IN CASES OF INJURIES. THAT'S WHAT IT DOES IS IT CREATES THESE ONLINE MARKETPLACES TO BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS RETAILERS AS FAR CALLS THEM. AND WE ALSO WANT TO GIVE THEM THE SAME. DEFENSES AS THE BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS WOULD AS WELL THERE'S A RECENT CASE ON POINT AND THAT IS BOLGER VERSUS AMAZON AND ONE THIS IS TODAY UNFORTUNATELY. WITH THE PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE AND IN ORDER TO REDRESS HER INJURIES HAD TO TAKE IT TO COURT. AND WE ENDED UP WITH A- AN EXCELLENT APPELLATE COURT DECISION JUST LAST WEEK. WHERE SHE WANTS AND SHE'S GONNA BE ONE OF THE WITNESSES TODAY SO HER PAIN HER. HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS BECOMES INSTRUCTIVE TO US BUT NOW THE COURTS HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ON SORT OF CASE BY CASE BASIS AS THEY DO SO IT IS TIME FOR. IT TO ACT. AS THE TRANSLATOR CREATE STATUS STATUE WE DO. TO BE SURE THAT WITH THAT ANYONE WHO WAS INJURED IN CALIFORNIA. HAS THE ABILITY TO GO AFTER THE PARTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING THAT DEFECTIVE PRODUCT INTO CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IT'S IN IN ITS LANGUAGE FAIRLY SIMPLE BUT I DO UNDERSTAND. THAT CONCEPT AND THIS THIS WORRY ABOUT STRICT LIABILITY CAN. CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY HE WITNESSES I HAVE EARLY IN TRENTON FROM THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN AS I MENTIONED ANGELA BOULDER WHO'S GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO BE WITH US TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

OF NICE TO SEE WITNESSES IN PERSON SO- FEEL FREE TO GO AHEAD AND- YOU CAN SPLIT THE FOUR MINUTES ANYWAY YOU CHOOSE WITH THAT GO AHEAD KELLY TO CAESAR. NICE TO SEE YOU MADAM CHAIR AND IF I MAY BEFORE YOU START YOUR- JOINT YOUR COLLEAGUES NOW EIGHT A HALF HOUR AGO TO SAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVEN'T THE OFTEN PERSUADED YOU TO SEE MY CLIENTS POINT OF VIEW OVER THE YEARS BUT YOU HAVE CERTAINLY HAD. AN OPEN DOOR- AND I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE'VE HAD ON ISSUES. SUCH AS THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO OVER YOUR TERMS AND BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY SO THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'VE BEEN PRETTY OPPORTUNITY AS WELL. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE CHRISTMAS CEILIDH ON BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONES BILL. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A LARGE EXPANSION OF PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EXTENDING WELL BEYOND. THE FRACTURED AND RETAILERS. IN CAPTURING ONLINE MARKET PLACES. WHICH IS A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN OUR PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWS. I OBVIOUSLY AB THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO WOULD ADD A SIGNIFICANT CODE SECTION TO OUR CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. THIS IS THIS WOULD BE A FIRST IN THE NATION BILL I WOULD NOTE FOR YOU THAT SEVERAL OTHER STATE LEGISLATURES AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE CONSIDERED SIMILAR BILLS ALL OF WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN REJECTED SO FAR. A LOT OF STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT- CONSUMERS CAN. HAVE ANY FORM OF RECOURSE- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SOME ADDITIONAL FACT PATTERNS BEYOND THE ONE THAT WE HEARD FROM THE WITNESS IN THE BOLGER CASE. AND I MEAN THAT THE BILL ITSELF EVEN IN THE FINDINGS TALKS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A POTENTIAL. OF FOR- PURSUING THE COULD BE ACHIEVING. BAND THAT LANGUAGE YOU KNOW DOESN'T GIVE US CERTAINTY AS TO WHAT SORT OF FACT PATTERNS WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING TO ADDRESS. NOW ANOTHER COMMON HAS BEEN MADE YOUR MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ABOUT LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. WE DON'T SEE THIS IS LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD WE THINK IN FACT IT CREATES A DIFFERENT FIELD OF PLAY. BECAUSE BY THIS EXAMPLE UNDER EXISTING PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW IN CALIFORNIA IN THE CIVIL CODE- IT DOES PROVIDE STRICTLY ABILITY FOR THE BRICK AND MORTAR SHOPPING MALL. HOWEVER THIS BILL WOULD IMPOSE STRICKLAND BILITY ON THE ONLINE SHOPPING MALL WHICH DOESN'T OCCUR EXCUSE ME I MISSPOKE IT PROVIDES STRICT LIABILITY UNDER EXISTING LAW FOR THE BRICK AND MORTAR. MANUFACTURER RETAILER BUT NOT THE BRICK AND MORTAR SHOPPING MALL BUT UNDER AB THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO. THE ONLINE MARKET PLACE THE ONLINE SHOPPING MALL WOULD BE SUBJECT TO IT. AND WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE RESULT THE ULTIMATE RESULT IS. THESE PRODUCT PROVIDERS THESE WEBSITES THE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ALL GOING TO BE SUBJECT- SUBJECT TO STRICT LIABILITY AND SUBSTANTIAL COSTS THERE'S GOING TO BE A DIMINUTION IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND THOSE THAT THEY DO AT A HIGHER PRICE. LET ME CONCLUDE ON THIS POINT- AND- IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE WHAT HAPPENED. TO MISS BOLGER IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE. DISCRETION THAT THE JUDGES THE COURTS HAVE TODAY DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS RECOURSE UNDER EXISTING LAW IN THIS CASE. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS CASE IS LIKELY TO BE APPEALED A PENNSYLVANIA STATE COURT ACTUALLY MADE A SIMILAR DECISION TO BOLGER IT WAS REVERSED ON APPEAL AND YOU KNOW MADAM CHAIR THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS OVER THE YEARS REGARDLESS OF SUBJECT MATTER BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO STEP INTO PENDING LITIGATION. BUT THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO DOES TAKE A SIDE IN THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BILL HELD LET'S SEE HOW THIS LITIGATION PLAYS OUT- FURTHER ALONG THE LINES AND THEN WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER IT THE CIVIL CODE NEEDS TO BE AMENDED IN ANYWAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER KELLY YOU STEP THREE MINUTES AND FORTY SECONDS. IF YOU WILL IT WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXTRA BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST TIME YOU'RE GOING TO BE A TESTIFYING IN ONE OF MY COMMITTEE SO I WILL USE MY- CHAIR PRIVILEGE GO AHEAD MR CAPITEC GIVE HIM. IT IT. IS GOING TO OKAY THANK YOU MANAGER. MY NAME'S JOHN CABOT ON THE CALL STATE. THE NOW FOR THE OF THE BUSINESS THE STATE'S LEADING SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION HERE- TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED EIGHTY THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO. THE BILL WILL HAVE A SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES ON SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NUMBER ONE JOB CREATORS THEY ARE VERY FRAGILE. MORE FRAGILE THAN EVER BEFORE. OUR RECENT SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT IF THINGS DON'T IMPROVE SOON UPWARDS OF 50% OF SMALL BUSINESSES MAY BE FORCED TO CLOSE. FOR MANY DEVASTATED EMPLOYERS ONLINE COMMERCE HAS BEEN THEIR ONLY LIFELINE IS VITAL IS MORE MORE BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES HAVE TURNED TO ONLINE VENUES TO SELL THEIR GOODS AND SERVICES. IN A SAFE WAY. SMALL BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW DON'T HAVE THE CAPITAL TO CREATE THEIR OWN WEBSITES. AND YOUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR COMING YEAR LISTED AT AN UPDATE TO THE ACCOUNT. MATTERS HAVING ACCESS TO ALL. COULD BE. CAN HAVE TO CLOSE YOUR SHOP. EIGHTY THREE TO SIXTY TWO CUT OFF THAT LIE. CREE HUGE BATTERIES A ENTRY. FOR THOSE ALL STRUGGLE SMALL DOES. THE WILL BE A REAL PAID PRICE. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO CONTINUE TO SELL ONLINE WILL BE FORCED TO INVEST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. TO COME THROUGH- EACH YEAR TO ON ON COMPLEX NEW PLATFORMS THANK YOU AND IT INCREASES LIABILITY ON ALL MARKET PLACE THEY CAN MISTER CRADDICK WE DO IT YOU'RE A- COP.

WELL ONCE AGAIN IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MANAGER. ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE. COUPLE THOUGHTS. TO BE CLEAR THIS THIS BILL PLACES ONLINE MARKET PLACES ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH THEIR BRICK AND MORTAR COUNTERPARTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF THIRD PARTY SALES THAT'S WHAT IT DOES WE HAVE THIS HOME THE MARKET PLACE BASICALLY UNREGULATED- AND THIS IS A BILL THAT JUST SIMPLY SAYS WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE YOU WE'RE GOING TO WIN AN ANALOGY WHICH YOU TO A MARKET PLACE- AND- THE NOTION THAT. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A SHOPPING MALL THE COURT IN THE BOLGER CASE WHICH JUST CAME OUT ABOUT A WEEK AGO. REJECTED THE COMPARISON TO A SHOPPING MALL IT'S NOT. IT SHOULD RATHER INACCURATE OF COMPARISON HE'S OUR ONLINE ONLINE MARKETPLACES AND THEY ARE- IF THIS BILL PROCEEDS JUST SIMPLY GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SAME GUIDELINES AND PROVIDE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS- THE BRICK AND MORTAR COMPANIES NOT NO MORE NO LESS AS I UNDERSTAND IT SO. THE BILL ALSO EXEMPTS THINGS LIKE USED AUCTIONED ARE HANDMADE GOODS UNLESS THE PRINCIPLES OF STRICT LIABILITY WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY IT EXEMPTS PRODUCTS THAT WERE NOT SOLD ON COMMISSION SUCH AS ADVERTISEMENTS AGAIN IT IS. DESIGNED TO WORK GOLD PARALLEL TO BE A PARALLEL SET OF PROVISIONS FOR ON THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE AS WE HAVE IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR MARKET PLACE SO. IT DOESN'T APPLY WHEN THE COMPENSATION IS JUST AN ADVERTISING FEE WHICH IT DOESN'T TO IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF COMMERCE. I CRAIGSLIST CRAIGSLIST INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I JUST LEARNED ACTUALLY- CHARGES AN ADVERTISING FEE AND YOU SELL YOUR PRODUCT THERE AND THEY MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS THEY DON'T PRETEND THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THE PRODUCT IS AND THEY DON'T BENEFIT FROM THE SALE. THEY BENEFIT FROM THE ADVERTISING THAT WOULD APPLY HERE AS WELL. AND IT TO THE BOTTOM LINE IT IT JUST ENSURES THAT THE BILL'S APPLICATION REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING STRICT LIABILITY CAN WHY DO WE HAVE STRICT LIABILITY BECAUSE WE WANT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN THE CONSUMER- TO ENHANCE SAFETY AND PROTECT THE INJURED PARTY THE STORE THAT THAT WOMAN A SHARED WITH US- IT REQUIRED LAWSUIT BECAUSE AMAZON SO WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE THE COMPANY THAT CREATED THE DEVICE THAT WAS- A POORLY CRAFTED IN ALWAYS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN CHINA THAT. IT WAS BEYOND REACH- BUT THE FACT THAT AMAZON HAS BEEN KNOWN TO AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS THAT HAVE KNOWN DEFECTS WITHOUT ANY ANY SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SALE OF THOSE PRODUCTS BUT THEY BENEFIT FROM THE SALE AND AGAIN THIS JUST PUTS THIS ON THE SAME FOOTING WITH OUR BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES SO- THERE SUCH MORE I COULD SAY BUT WE HAVE A VERY COMPETENT AUTHOR HERE WHO CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER. CONCERNS AND- WE'LL START WITH SENATOR MORNING AND THEN SENATOR BORCHERS. THE YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU I'M SORRY I MISSED THE AUTHORS INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL THAT I HAVE READ THE ANALYSIS AND- JUST CURIOUS. HAS THIS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN ANY OTHER STATE TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO THIS IS WOULD BE A FIRST I THINK OTHER STATES HAVE LOOKED AT THIS AND THURMOND. DIFFERENT CASES IN THE COURTS AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT BUT NOT ANY CONSISTENT POLICY THREAT SO I WOULD ASSUME AS USUAL IN THIS AREA THAT A LOT OF STATES WILL BE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES. AND ONCE WE CAN GET THIS PAST THEN I THINK OTHERS WILL TAKE A LOOK AT OUR MODEL AND FOLLOW SUIT THANK YOU CAN I WOULD JUST COMMENT IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT MOTHERS ACTIVE LITIGATION AND SHOULDN'T WE WAIT I THINK ONE OF THE RULES OF THE LEGISLATURE IS TO DEFINE POLICY. WHERE THERE MAY BE CONFUSION IN THE MARKETPLACE- SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS HERE AND JUST TO BE CLEAR I THINK THE CHAIR JUST CLARIFY THIS IS WELL. A PLATFORM THAT CONNECTS BUYER AND THE SELLER. SUCH AS AN EBAY EXAMPLE- THEY AREN'T COVERED BY THIS BILL OR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY ARE. BUT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY WILL BE SO WE TRADITIONALLY THINK OF. EBAY AS JUST AN AUCTION SITE WE TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AT SEA. AS JUST CONNECTING. MY MOTHER WHO MAKES FELTED BOOTIES AND PEOPLE WHO MAY WANT TO BUY THOSE HOWEVER. THE BUSINESS MODEL THAT THEY ARE MORE AND MORE MOVING INTO IS THEY ARE. BRINGING IN BRAND NEW PRODUCTS AND SEEKING SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY FUNCTION. LIKE ANY BASE CASE AN AUCTION HOUSE OR ENTITIES CASE JUST FACILITATING THE MOVEMENT OF HANDMADE GOODS. THOSE TRANSACTIONS WOULD NOT APPLY HERE BUT WHERE THEY ARE ACTING. LIKE AN AMAZON DOES FACILITATING THE DISTRIBUTION INTO CALIFORNIA OF GOODS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS YES IT WOULD APPLY TO THEM THANK YOU IN I GUESS. THE SAME WITH THE CRAIGSLIST EXAMPLE THAT SOME BOOKS THIS IS VIA IS AS WELCOMING ONLINE CLASSIFIED AD RIGHT SITUATION AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO EXEMPT THOSE KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS WITH THEIR THE-OPTIONS THE CLASSIFIED ADS IN THE OTHERS IN FACT WE'VE TAKEN AND- TAKING AN AMENDMENT. THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT ADVERTISING IS NOT RECEIVING BENEFIT BECAUSE THAT RECEIPT THE BENEFIT IS A TERM OF ART THAT'S BEEN USED IN A LOT OF THESE CASES GOING BACK FOR DECADES. IT'S AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS ASKED FOR BY I BELIEVE FACEBOOK BUT ONE THAT TO ME MAKES ACTION MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE WHAT IF THINGS WERE TRYING TO DO IS EQUATE. THESE ONLINE MARKETPLACES WITH A BRICK AND MORTAR AND NOBODY. WHATEVER SUGGEST THAT IF FACEBOOK PUT UP AN AD FOR A NEWSPAPER PUT UP AN AD OR A MAGAZINE PUT UP AN AD FOR. A WALMART AND A PRODUCT THAT'S BEING SOLD THERE THAT THE FACT THAT THEY TOOK THE AD REVENUE WOULD MAKE THEM LIABLE UNDER STRICT LIABILITY THEY'RE NOT A RETAILER AS THE COURTS HAVE DEFINED SO WE'RE WE'RE STARTING IN IN IS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS WE'RE STARTING TO STEP INTO AREAS THAT THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY THAT HELPFUL BECAUSE AN ADVERTISER IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR CASE WOULD NEVER BE. BROUGHT IN. AS IN THAT SENSE AS AS A PARTY FOR STRICT LIABILITY CASE. IT WOULD BE THE- RETAILER SO. WHAT THINGS WERE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL IS QUITE THE ONLINE MARKET PLACES IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR. AS MUCH AS WE CAN. AND NOT CREATE ADDITIONAL KIND OF EXEMPTIONS AND LANGUAGE AROUND THIS A MAN JUST. GIVEN THE SAUSAGE MAKING THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH. WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AS MANY OF THE CONCERNS AS WE CAN BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT CREATING THESE OTHER CATEGORIES. AND MY WORRY IS THAT IF WE DO THEN WHEN NEW TECHNOLOGIES COME ONLINE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR THE COURTS OR FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO SORT OUT. WHETHER OR NOT THAT NEW. BUSINESS MODEL WAS INTENDED TO BE COVERED HERE SO THE MORE WE'RE SAYING IF YOU'RE FUNCTIONING ONLINE FOR YOUR FUNCTIONING BRICK AND MORTAR AND YOU ARE THAT RETAILER AND A CONDUIT FOR THAT PRODUCT BEING DELIVERED TO. A CALIFORNIA CITIZEN AND A CALIFORNIA CITIZEN GETS INJURED STRICT LIABILITY WILL BE ATTACHED SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT LITERALLY THAT SIMPLE BUT IT'S THE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A COMPLEX WORLD AND TRYING TO MANAGE ALL OF THE- CONCERNS THAT HAVE BROUGHT TO US SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO PARSE SOME OF THAT OUT WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THOSE DETAILS. THANK THE CHAIR COMMENTED EARLIER WERE OFTEN PLAYING CATCH UP IN TERMS OF THE WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY MOVING FORWARD AND NEW PLATFORMS NEW METHODS OF MARKETING PRODUCTS. OUR OLD BRICK AND MORTAR LAWS DON'T ALWAYS CATCH UP OR DON'T ALWAYS SUPPLY I THINK THE AMAZON EXAMPLES. OF PEOPLE HARM TO BUYING THE PRODUCTS THEY BUY THROUGH AMAZON AMAZON IS THE SELLER EVEN IF THEY'VE BOUGHT IT FROM A MANUFACTURER- IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME THAT. THE CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE THAT REMEDY AND THAT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS SOLD BY. A SELLER WHO ALSO SELLS THE THEIR PRODUCTS NOW THAT THEY ARE THE VENDOR OF THE PRODUCT ONLINE THAT THEY SHOULD SOMEHOW BE EXEMPT FROM. THE PROTECTIONS THAT CONSUMERS FACE IF THEY BOUGHT THE SAME PRODUCT WALKING INTO A BRICK AND MORTAR. RETAIL UNITS SO- MY PREACHING OR WORK ON THIS MADAM CHAIRMAN THAT DIDN'T MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THIS ISSUE ON A COUPLE LEVELS WE DISCUSSED. A COUPLE ISSUES PRIOR WHETHER OR NOT THIS HAD- IN ADEQUATELY COVERED CONNECTION. AND IT IS IT IS IT WILL TAKE A DRINK. I'M SORRY THAT WE WILL TAKE A DRINK YES EXACTLY HA HA HA. AND IT'S FUNNY ENOUGH I THINK THIS HAS- IN ANCILLARY CONNECTION BUT IT'S NOT ONE THAT I THINK IS HELPFUL. IS THAT EARLIER WE WERE DISCUSSING ON HOW WE PROTECT HOUSES FROM BEING FORECLOSED UPON. PROTECTING RENTERS IN MAKING EMERGENCY ALLOWANCES FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. AND SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS. ATTACHING STRICTLY ABILITY TO A BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE THAT MAYBE HAD BRICK AND MORTAR ON MONDAY. SHUT DOWN. IT IS NOW SURVIVING WITH ONLINE SALES. I CAN I CAN IMAGINE THAT THE MARKETPLACE IS JUST FULL OF THESE INSTANCES WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE THIS PANDEMIC. AND BY ADDING IN THE STRICTLY ABILITY COMPONENT. NOT ONLY DOES OUR BUSINESS MODEL GO COULD GO SIDEWAYS I SUPPOSE THERE ARE OVERHEAD IN INSURANCE EXPECTATION WILL TAKE THEM SIDEWAYS AS WELL. IS THIS NOT MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS TO COME BACK IN JANUARY. NO SENATE BECAUSE I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE IT IS AND I WOULD ARGUE IT IS RESPECTFULLY ONLY BECAUSE WE LITERALLY SPENT FIVE AND A HALF HOURS. DECLARING HOW IMPORTANT IS WAS TO MAKE EMERGENCY ALLOWANCES FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE T. TO LOOK AFTER THEIR FAMILY AND STAY IN THEIR HOMES. THIS IS NOW TAKING THE LIVELIHOOD OF SO MANY SMALL MOM AND POP OPERATIONS THAT ARE RELYING ON ONLINE SALES SINGLE MOMS. FRIENDLIES IN IS ADDING A STRICT LIABILITY COMPONENT. THAT I THINK YOU COULD PRETTY MUCH DERAIL THE FUTURE OF THOSE SMALL OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE WILLING TO TAKE ON THOSE LIABILITIES BUT YOUR POINTS ARE. ABSOLUTELY ON THE MONEY I THINK WE GET A BUNCH OF CRAP FROM OVERSEAS. THAT'S EITHER FRAUDULENT POORLY MADE AND FIGHTS BROUGHT INTO THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT A CLEAR NEXUS OF WHO IS BEHIND IT PEOPLE IN AMERICA GET HURT. THERE'S NO ONE BUT A PO BOX IN AN EMAIL ADDRESS OUTSIDE OF BEIJING. THAT'S A PROBLEM. MY ISSUE IS TIMING. SHOULDN'T THIS WAIT UNTIL JANUARY AND GO THROUGH THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE CYCLEBECAUSE IN THIS EMERGENCY CONTACTS I THINK THIS WOULD ONLY HURT US EVEN THOUGH I THINK YOUR POINTS HAVE SOME MERIT DOWN THE ROAD AND THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THIS BE BROUGHT BACK THANK YOU SO NOTED LET ME LET ME. IF YOU WANNA OPEN FOR IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND BRIEFLY THE BILLS BEFORE US IT'S BEEN WELL DISCUSSED IT'S GOT AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS WE ARE GOING TO MOVE IT EITHER WE'RE GOING OF ALL FORTY THE MOVE IT FORWARD OR OR NOT IT IS BEFORE US TODAY WE WILL HEAR IT SO IF YOU WANT TO JUST COMMENT BRIEFLY YOU CAN IF YOU WANT WITH YOUR INTELLIGENCE. BECAUSE YOUR COMMENTS AND SOME THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENT. MISPERCEIVED WHAT THE SENATE BECAUSE THAT MOM AND POP. WHO HAD A BRICK AND MORTAR. THEY'RE SUBJECT TO STRICT LIABILITY AS IT IS THE WORK THEY WORK NOW THERE ARE THEY CREATING AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE NO. THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS THROUGH THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE TO THAT EXTENT. SINCE THERE WILL BE A RETAILER THEY STILL KERRY THAT LIABILITY. SO LIKE WE SHOP. YES BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CREATE THE MARKET PLACE THEY'RE GONNA SELL IT THROUGH AN AMAZON COURT AT C. OR AN EBAY BECAUSE THE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS. SO IN THAT CASE. THIS IS ACTUALLY MORE PROTECTIVE IN THE REASON IT'S BALLOT NOW. IS BECAUSE MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE IN FACT SHOPPING ONLINE AND GETTING PRODUCT FROM WHEREVER AND- WITHOUT THE SAME EXPECTATION OF SAFETY THAT THEY WOULD IF THEY GO DOWN. TO THAT BRICK AND MORTAR SHOP. SO THAT. MOM AND POP DISTRIBUTOR WITH THAT STORE IS GOING TO CARRY THAT LIABILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE RETAIL WHETHER THEY'RE RETAILING ONLINE. FOR THEIR RETAILING THROUGH THEIR BRICK AND MORTAR EITHER GOING THROUGH EBAY. NOT YET WELL BUT YOU THINK THAT YES BECAUSE WHAT EBAY WILL TELL YOU. IS DON'T SUE US. SUE MOM AND POP. WHEN EBAY IS BROKERING TO ME WHEN THE WHEN THE MOM AND POP IS BROKERING USING THE EBAY PLATFORM THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE PROCURING PRODUCT THEY'RE SELLING PRODUCTS USING EBAY TO EFFECTUATE THAT AUCTION. WELL IF IT'S AN OPTION WITH THE AUCTIONS ARE ENSURED THAT THE DIRECT SALE OF YOU CAN PURCHASE IT NOW OR CHOOSE IT LATER SO THINK ABOUT IT RIGHT THAT'S THE SAME SITUATION THAT YOU DESCRIBED ABOUT. CHINA THOSE COMPANIES IN CHINA. DON'T HAVE ANY LIABILITY BECAUSE THERE. ACTUALLY JURISDICTION WE CAN'T GET TO THEM. SO IF AND WHAT AMAZON WOULD ARGUE SO IF MOM POP. THEIR PRODUCT UP TO SAIL. THROUGH AMAZON AND THEIR PRODUCT HARM SOMEBODY AMAZON'S GONNA SAY DON'T TALK TO US RIGHT WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE THEY ARE THAT FACILITATOR. YOU GO AFTER MOM AND POP IN THE CASE OF THE% CHINESE COMPANY THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THEIR EXPOSURE SECTIONAL. BUT THAT'S A FALSE PROMISE YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE CREATING CONSUMER ADVOCACY PULLED ON WE'RE NOT GOT WHAT WHAT SHOP SESSION WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A DEBATE HERE ON THIS YOU CAN ASK A QUESTION. THE MAJOR POINT. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO ON AND WE HAVE SOME MORE. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR DORADO. YEAH YOU KNOW WE'VE JUST HAD TWO OTHER BILLS COME BEFORE IS ALL RELATED TO WHAT THE RULES ARE FOR ONLINE. THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES AND HOW OF ON LINE IS USED- IN THAT FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS ONLINE IS USE FOR THAT- THERE IS WE HAVE TO CATCH UP AT I MEAN IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE NO ROLE LIKE THIS HAS BEEN. PASSED ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH TO CATCH UP ON IT'S THE SAME THING THE IMPACT THAT ALL OF THESE COMPANIES ARE HAVING ON CONSUMERS ON EMPLOYEES. ON REVENUE OF TWO GOVERNMENT IT KEEPS GOING ON AND ON I MEAN AMAZON IS A TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANY A TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANY AND YOU CAN'T USE THE FACE OF SMALL BUSINESSES TO DEFEND THE COMPANY THAT'S WORTH A TRILLION DOLLARS SO I. I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE I APPRECIATE HOW- DETAILED YOUR OF YOUR ANALYSIS AND BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT TO US BUT FROM A- YOU KNOW BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS THE WAY THAT YOU DO A STUDY IN THE WAY THIS IS HOW I SEE IT SO. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR BURKE. THANK YOU MANAGER- A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR I APPRECIATE TO THE GAME OF CATCH UP AS THE TENDERIZER RIGHTLY NOTED- AND TEMAS BOLGER- I WAS HEARTENED TO SEE YOU GET SEVEN AT LEAST THE BEGINNINGS OF REMEDY WILL SEE WHAT'S APPEALED ON ON THE CASE- BUT THAT WS IT- VERY ENCOURAGING PRESS IN TO SEE THE COURTS THEMSELVES BEGIN TO ACT HERE. THE WAY I STARTED TO FIND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY- IS THAT THE COURTS ACTUALLY HAVE STARTED TO MOVE AT LEAST IN OUR JURISDICTION TOWARDS A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARDS FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE FURNISHED BY AMAZON OR UNDER THAT SORT OF WAREHOUSING WITHIN THE WAREHOUSING STREAM BASICALLY BEING IN SOME KIND OF FACILITY OR HAVING. SOME OTHER CONTACTED IT SEEMS TO ME MAYBE THE AUTHOR COULD CLEAR BUT REALLY THE REMEDY THAT THAT IS LACKING RIGHT NOW IS MORE FOR THE KINDS OF PRODUCTS THAT MAYBE DON'T GO THROUGH SAY AN AMAZON WAREHOUSE BUT STILL HAVE THAT. AMAZON BRAND OVER IT THAT THAT SORT OF IMPLIED WARRANTY OF YOU KNOW FITNESS- OR THOSE SORT OF OTHER COMMON LAW THINGS THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET AROUND- AND I'M JUST WONDERING YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN SORT OF DESCRIBE I GUESS. WHAT THE BOLGER CASE WHICH INTERESTINGLY WAS JUST DECIDED WHAT A WEEK AGO OR SO RIGHT ON THE EVE OF HIS HEARING BUT WHAT WHAT THAT COVERED BUT ALSO WHAT IT WHAT IT DIDN'T COVER AND WHY WHAT WHY YOU TO ARGUE FOR THIS BILL IN IN LIGHT OF THAT CASE ALREADY BEEN ON THE BOOKS. RIGHT AND THAT'S A- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SAID. DE THE BOLGER CASE WAS ABOUT THE FULFILLED BY AMAZON CATEGORY OF BUSINESS AN AMAZON. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT ALL THAT CASE WAS ABOUT THE REASON WE NEED TO TAKE THE STEPS IS THE COURTS ARE GOING TO STEP BY STEP LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE WHICH ARE GOING TO TRY TO BE DISTINGUISHED. BY COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON AND AMAZON IN ANY WHEN YOU READ THE BOLGER CASE AMAZON COMPARED ITSELF TO SHOPPING MALL. TO CREDIT CARD ISSUER TO A TRUCKING COMPANY TO INTERNET SEARCH PROVIDER TO NEWSPAPER RUNNING CLASSIFIED AS THE THEY TRIED ALL THOSE ARGUMENTS AND THE BOLGER COURT REJECTED THEM OUT OF HAND. I WON THE ARGUMENT SAID IT WAS A BROUGHT UP WAS WAS IF YOU PROVIDE LIABILITY HERE THEN YOU COULD BE PROVIDING LIVE REALLY TO ALL OF THOSE OTHER CATEGORIES. AND IF A FOOTNOTE COULD CHUCKLE THE FOOTNOTE CHUCKLED SAID THE DISTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT. I'M IS WE HAVE ONE CASE HERE THAT THIS IS BENDIS DECLINE OR DECIDED THERE WILL BE MANY MORE AND IN FACT IN THAT CASE INTERESTINGLY AMAZON CLAIMS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE THE BEST. WOULD BE BEST POSITION TO ASSESS THE COVERING VEILING POLICIES INCLUDING CONSUMER INTEREST INDIAN PRODUCTS AND ALL THAT SO AMAZON WAS ARGUING THAT THEY SHOULD COME TO THE LEGISLATURE THE COURT OF COURSE WAS OFFENDED BY THAT. AND SAID NO WE CAN DECIDE THIS JUST FIVE. SO AMAZON WHAT IS TO COME LEGISLATURE. IT'S IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND CAN I JUST A FOLLOW UP THERE CAN I EAT YEAH I DON'T KNOW VAN ZANDT ITSELF WHAT HAS TESTIFIED HERE WERE IN FOR A- IT'S MORE THE ASSOCITION LEADING US AYE MR MCCABE LEADER BUT- I'M WONDERING WHAT WHY YOU THINK THAT. CITY THAT THERE'S NOT SUFFICIENT CONTROL FOR. THAT SORT OF A SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH ROLE FOR THE AMAZONS OUT THERE TO BE SUBJECT TO THIS KIND OF LIABILITY LIKE WHY WHY THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM SAY- THE MOM AND POP IS AS THE AUTHOR PUT IT WELL YOU HAVE TO ASK I WAS ON THAT QUESTION THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ARGUING IS THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND STRICT LIABILITY SHOULD ATTACKED. IF THEY SAID YEAH WE'RE A RETAILER LIKE TO STRICT LIABILITY LAWS DESCRIBE WHICH WE THINK THEY ARE WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THEY ARE AND THEY SHOULD BE THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS BILL. WE BEEN TALKING DEBTS EVEN TALKING EVEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO ANOTHER'S AMAZON OFFERED US SOME AMENDMENTS YESTERDAY INTERESTINGLY THEY'RE CONCERNED AT THIS IS TO NARROW AND THEY ACTUALLY WANT US TO BROADEN IT SO WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THE AMENDMENTS. WERE THAT THEY OFFERED I'M NOT SURE WE WANT TO BROADEN THIS AT THIS POINT WE'RE TRYING TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS. ONLINE MARKETPLACE BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILER. TREAT THEM THE SAME AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL SAYS IF YOU'RE AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE YOU ARE A RETAILER. UNDER THE STRICT LIABILITY LAWS AND HAVE THE SAME DEFENSES. RIGHT AS A RETAILER. WOOD IN THAT SAME CIRCUMSTANCE SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE TO A QUICK THOSE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THESE LARGE COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING THESE DISTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE BRINGING IN FACT RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING. DANGEROUS PRODUCT INTO CALIFORNIA. THAT WOULD HAVE THAT THIS PRODUCT HAVE NO AVENUE TO GET INTO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE NO BECAUSE OF THE STRICT LIABILITY NO OTHER RETAILER. WOULD BRING THEM IN THEY HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY THEY LIVE WITH THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR. DECADES THEY UNDERSTAND THAT. SO NOW BECAUSE UNDER THE GUISE OF ONLINE MARKETPLACE. WE'RE DIFFERENT WHICH THEY'RE NOT. THEY NOW ARE INTRODUCING DANGERS PRODUCT IN THE CALIFORNIA. AND CALIFORNIANS AND WHO WERE INJURED. HAVE NO REMEDY THERE'S NO ABILITY TO GO AFTER THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER THROUGH THAT CHECK SO JUST LIKE IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR. THEY GO AFTER UNDER STRICT LIABILITY THE RETAILER IN THIS CASE ON MY MARKET PLACE WHO THEN HAS THE ABILITY TO GO AFTER GO UP THAT CHAIN. TO THE MANUFACTURER. THAT'S WITH ASSISTING SO ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL THOUGH ABOUT LIKE LETTINGTHEM MANUFACTURERS OFF THE HOOK SO TO SPEAK THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE PROPER INCENTIVES HERE THEN TO FILL BECAUSE THEY'RE BECAUSE THEY'RE LIABLE TO THE RETAILER. RIGHT THAT'S THE CHANGE RIGHT. EITHER IN COUNTRY THEY'RE GONNA BE THANK YOU THEY'RE OUT OF COUNTRY THEN THAT YET THE CONSUMERS THE ONE BEARING THE LOAD WHICH IS WHY. WE ARE STRICTLY ABILITY POLICY IN THE FIRST PLACE- YOU CANNOT BE I APPRECIATE THE WORK DONE HERE LOOK I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE IT THERE IS SOME MURKINESS TO ME IN THIS SPACE WHERE THERE'S NO REAL- CONTROLLED AND NOTHING'S REALLY IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FOR INSTANCE FROM THE MARKET PLACE I KNOW THAT THAT'S THE PARTS THAT THE COURTS HAVEN'T REALLY pSTEPPING IN HERE SO. I'M HOPING YOU WE CAN JUST I WANNA TRY TO GET A CLEAR PICTURE ON THAT BEFORE THE FLOOR BUT I LOOK I THINK THIS BILL ISN'T NECESSARY RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'VE WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT AT SOME POINT STAND UP TO- YOU KNOW FOR OUR MOM AND POP BUSINESSES AND I SAW MISTER CAPITEC WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THESE- INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES OUT THERE FRANKLY AND- I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE BASICALLY PUTTING OUR INDUSTRIES AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE AT THIS POINT IN THIS COUNTRY. WHERE A CHINESE MANUFACTURER CAN MAKE FAULTY PRODUCT AND RUN OFF SCOT FREE AT LEAST SOME OF THEM IS BOLGER WITH THE LIABILITY AND THEN MEANWHILE YOU KNOW WE START MAKING BATTERIES EVER IN CALIFORNIA AND I HOPE WE DO- YOU'RE DARN SURE WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE FOR THAT UNDER OUR STATE LAW SO I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A FEW REASONS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE. THE WORK TODAY THANK YOU SENATOR IT AND POINT TO PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH DESCRIBES SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS OF THE COURTS USE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO HAVE STRICT LIABILITY BECAUSE THERE ARE DEFENSES THAT A RETAILER CAN HAVE TO STRICTLY ABILITY DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT THAT THEY HAPPENED AND THEIR ROLE IN THAT PRODUCT MOVING. TO THE- TO THE CONSUMER. SO ALL OF THAT'S WHY THE STAFF. AND WE DON'T WANT INTERFERE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE COURTS WANT TO WE THINK THE COURTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO STILL USE THAT ANALYSIS AND USE THOSE TERMS. AND APPLY THEM SO ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT ONLINE MARKETPLACE IS A RETAILER. UNDER THIS EXISTING CONTEXT AND AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IF AMAZON DOES HAVE. SOME LIABILITY NOW. THEY WILL US AT LEAST WE ANTICIPATE THEY'LL TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE RESPONSIBILITY SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THESE PROBLEMS HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEN. I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE POLICY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADVANCE HERE WE HAVE A SENATOR ON BURKE AND THEN I THINK WITHOUT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL ASK YOU TO CLOSE SENATOR UMBERG. OF THANK YOU VENTURE OUT SO NUMBER SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INTERACTION WE'VE HAD ON THIS MATTER I HAVE A QUESTION FOR IS MR MCHALE LEAST THOUGH HE'S HIDING THERE I SEE A MISSED MAKAYLA OR MIST COVERED I HAVE A- QUESTION CONCERNING CHAINSAWS WHICHEVER. YOU WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT. SO VETERANS OMINOUS RISING ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY GOTTA TALK ABOUT CHAIN SAWS SO IF I BUY A CHAIN SAW ON AMAZON MANUFACTURED IN CHINA WITHOUT ANY OTHER CONTEXT UNITED STATES IN AND IT MALFUNCTIONS A CHAIN BREAKS AND HARMS ME WHAT WHAT'S MY RECOURSE. WELL IS THERE ANY DISPOSAL RIGHT MADAM CHAIR FIVE YES PLEASE- IS THERE ANY DISTINCTION BETWEEN A BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITY VERSUS THE ONLINE MARKET PLACE IN YOUR EXAMPLE. NO OF MY EXAMPLE IS I'M BUYING A CHAIN SAW FROM A CHINESE MANUFACTURER THEY KNOW THE CONTEXT HERE IN CALIFORNIA OTHER THAN THROUGH AMAZON WHAT WHAT RECOURSE DO I HAVE IF IT BREAKS. IF IT HARMS ME. HI I DON'T KNOW THE REACH OF OUR CURRENT LONG ARM STATUTE WHETHER OR NOT CALIFORNIA COULD GET JURISDICTION. OVER THAT COMPANY IN CHINA OF COURSE IF THEY IF THE CHINESE COMPANY SOLD YOUR- A CHAIN SAW IN. AND AMY'S OR SOMETHING OR A HOME DEPOT. ARGUABLY IT WOULD BE THE SAME ISSUE. WELL THAT IS TAKING A VERY SYMPATHETIC WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I THINK THAT SB THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO IS TAKING A VERY. EASY OUT. WHICH IS WHAT JUST MAKE A MALL STRICTLY LIABLE. BUT I'M NOT SURE BUT BUT BUT YOU IT RECORDS YOU HAVE RECOURSE AGAINST HOME DEPOT. WITH WHEN I. WHEN AMAZON SELLS CHAINSAWS ON LINE. OR OTHER PRODUCTS ONLINE THAT ARE MANUFACTURED IN A JURISDICTION OUTSIDE THE REACH CALIFORNIA. DO THEY INFORM THE CONSUMER THAT IF THIS THING BREAKS IF MY CHAINSAW BREAKS AND- HARMS ME. I'LL HAVE VIRTUALLY NO RECOURSE. I DON'T KNOW HOW AMAZON OPERATES EXACTLY AND I DON'T REPRESENT THEM THEY HAVE A LOBBYIST OF THEIR OWN WHO COULD PERHAPS ANSWER THAT I'M SORRY I'M PICKING ON YOU I DON'T MEAN TO PICK ON NO NOT AT ALL AYE AYE AND IF THEY DO HAVE A LOBBYIST THEIR OWN I SUSPECT THEY COULD AFFORD TO HAVE THEM HERE IN THE QUESTION THEN IS WHY AREN'T THEY HERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS BILL. DOES MENTION THEM SEVERAL TIMES FOR JUST THE REASON I THINK THAT SENATOR UMBERG MENTIONED IS THAT. THEY WOULD THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE SELLING THEIR CHAINSAW SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD THEY WOULD THEY HAVE ANY LIABILITY IN AND IF THEY FEEL THAT THEY DON'T ON WHAT BASIS DO THEY FEEL THEY DON'T OR DO THEY INFORM THE CONSUMER OR DO THEY INFORM TO CONSULT THE- CONCERN THAT I HAVE. IS THAT. IN THE BILL- AS I UNDERSTAND SEWER STONE. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CRAIGS LIST CROWD. IS NOT CAPTURED BY THIS BILL WHERE YOU HAVE DIRECT CONSUMER CONSUMER- INTERACTION WHERE THE PLATFORM MERE IT MERELY ACTS AS A CONDUIT NOT. A OR A FACILITATOR VERSUS AN AMAZON TYPE MODEL IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO IN ENSURE THAT WHERE. A CRAIGSLIST WHICH ACTS LIKE A CLASSIFIED AD SECTION TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF REVENUE AS A NEWSPAPER WOULD WHEN THEY DO CLASSIFIED ADS BUT THE TRANSACTION THEN HAPPENS HUNDRED PERCENT. OUTSIDE OF THE SPHERE THEY DON'T CARE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ROLE IN THAT. THAT CLASSIFIED ADS TYPE TRANSACTION WHICH DOES TEND TO BE. SOME PEOPLE SELLING USED PRODUCTS ARE HAVE TOO MANY THINGS IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A MAJOR COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM TO THE EXTENT THAT IT BECOMES A MAJOR COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION. MECHANISM LIKE THE AT SEASON EBAY'S HAVE BECOME BECAUSE THEY'VE MOVED ON BEYOND THE PURE AUCTION SITE AND IF YOU'RE CRAFTING SITE. WHICH IS HOW THEY STARTED THEN THEY COULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS BILL HERE'S HERE'S MY CONCERN IS BOTH FOR THE COURTS AS WELL AS FOR. SOMEONE WHO'S THINKING ABOUT ENTERING THE SPACE IT IS THAT IN OTHER IS THE LAW. WE HAVE GUIDANCE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO FORM. YOU CAN SEE HERE HERE ARE THE FACTORS THE COURT'S GOING TO LOOK AT TO SEE WHETHER YOU'RE PROTECTED IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN YOUR PRESENCE OUTSIDE THE CALIFORNIA. TERMS A MINIMUM CONTACTS HERE'S BASICALLY THE CHECKLIST THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT. SO IS YOU AND I DISCUSSED I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF GUIDANCE BOTH TO THE COURTS AS WELL AS TO. POTENTIAL ENTREPRENEURS WHO WENT INTO THAT SPACE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU. ARE DONE NOT PROHIBITING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SELLER AND BUYER. THAT WOULD BE ONE FACTOR IF YOU ARE NOT PROVIDING MODES OF TRANSPORTATION IF THE IF THE EXCHANGE HAPPENS THROUGH A THIRD PARTY VENDOR COMPLETELY THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER FACTOR IF FOR EXAMPLE. YOU LIST THE LOCATION N. DO DISCLOSE THE CONSUMER THAT THAT YOU ARE SIMPLY A CONDUIT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER FACTOR SO IF WE PROVIDE FACTORS SO THAT THE CRAIGS LIST AND- TO THE EXTENT THAT. THE DEAD SEA IS WANTS TO MOVE BACK INTO THE REALM WHERE THEY ARE MORE CRAIG'S LIST D. VERSUS MORE AMAZON E. THEY CAN DO THAT THAT WE ACTUALLY GIVE SOME SORT OF. GUIDANCE AND SO I KNOW YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT WORKING ON THAT AND- YET WE TALKED ABOUT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE JURISPRUDENCE AROUND STRICT LIABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BASE SUMMIT CASE THE COURT SISTER CLUB BILLY ALSO APPLIES WEARING NON MANUFACTURING PARTY IS THE VERDICT CHEYNA DISTRIBUTION. OF THE PRODUCT PLAYS AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE PRODUCING AND MARKETING ENTERPRISE OF A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND PROFITS FROM THE PLACING OF THE PRODUCT INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE. SO IN A LOT OF THE STATEMENTS IN THE JURISPRUDENCE IN THE VARIOUS CASES THERE ARE EXACTLY THOSE TESTS. I WORRY ABOUT. CREATING BECAUSE IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CREATE THESE DISTINCTIONS AROUND ONLINE MARKETPLACES BECAUSE THEN THE NEXT TYPE OF BUSINESS MODEL THAT COMES UP WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CREATE A NEW SET OF LISTS FOR THEM I THINK WE CAN RELIABLY RELY ON WHAT THE COURTS HAVE DONE IN THE JURISPRUDENCE AROUND STRICT LIABILITY AND BY SAYING IF YOU ARE BRINGING THE PRODUCT INTO CALIFORNIA FACILITATING THAT BRING THAT PRODUCT TO THE CALIFORNIA. BY THESE EXISTING STANDARDS YOUR RETAILER AND WHEN YOU'RE A RETAILER WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS AND- BY THE WAY BEING A RETAILER UNDER STRICT LIABILITY HAS SEVERAL DEFENSES TO IT THAT THAT RETAILER CAN BRING UP AND SAY YOU CAN'T TREAT I DON'T GET STRICT LIABILITY THIS CASE BECAUSE THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR. THAT CAN HAPPEN IN AN ONLINE. MARKET PLACE IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO TREAT. THESE ONLINE MARKETPLACES THE SAME IS WE'VE TREATED. THE BRICK AND MORTAR COMPANIES FOR DECADES. IN A STRICT LIABILITY CONTACTS BUT I. AND I AGREE WITH YOU WE WANT TO TREAT AN AMAZON. LIKE A BRICK AND MORTAR ENTITY YEAH BUT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT MODELS IN THERE MAYBE IN THE FUTURE DIFFERENT MODELS. THAT WE DO THAT I DISAGREE I THINK WE SHOULD DISTINGUISH I THINK WE SHOULD. SET OUT SOME PARAMETERS SO THAT THERE IS SOME STABILITY SO THAT SO THAT SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO COME INTO THE SPACE. CAN LEAST HAVE SOME GUIDANCE. BUT IF WE'RE SIMPLY GONNA LEAVE IT UP TO THE COURTS TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW GO AHEAD TAKE YOUR CHANCES AND SEE WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SAYS. I THINK THAT NHIBITS I THINK THAT INHIBITS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND I THINK IT INHIBITS- THE ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS ACTUALLY INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER THAT'S MY VIEW- IT CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IT EXCUSE ME. BUT LET'S STOP FOR A SECOND I'LL LET YOU ANSWER THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES BUT I DON'T WANT TO. ENGAGE IN ANY FURTHER COLLOQUY HERE I THINK THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE. TO DECIDE IN THE AUTHORS TAKEN RESOLVE THOSE QUESTIONS A CORD STILL HAS THE DISCRETION TO ENSURE THE LONG STANDING PRINCIPLES. OF STRICT LIABILITY APPLY. SO THERE WILL BE IN SOME INSTANCES. THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSERT THOSE DEFENSES AS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ASSERTED. WE ARE JUST TRYING NOW TO ANALOGIZE. AND TO PUT INTO THE SAME FRAMEWORK. THE ONLINE PLATFORMS AS THEY DO BUSINESS S. AS WE HAVE WITH THE BRICK AND MORTAR AND- WITH THE WITH THE DISTINCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN BETWEEN. THOSE WHO ARE SELLING SECOND HAND PRODUCTS OR JUST DOING ADVERTISING CLEARLY THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE THEY ARE THE SAME IN CERTAIN DUTIES THE SALE THE RETAIL ASPECTS OF WHAT A BRICK AND MORTAR STORES AND WHAT AN- ONLINE MARKET PLACES THEY WILL BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS AND IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME. THE AMENDMENTS AGAIN GIVE THE COURTS THE DISCRETION TO APPLY STRICT LIABILITY WERE APPROPRIATE AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE LAWSUIT SO SENATOR UMBERG WHEN HE DECIDED HAD ENOUGH OF THIS PLACE AND GO BACK TO PRACTICING LAW BE SOME GOOD LITIGATION FOR YOU TO. TO PURSUE BUT- THE I THINK THE AMENDMENTS GIVE DISCRETION TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE FACTS OF THE CASE JUSTIFIES STRICKLAND ABILITY OR DO NOT IT JUST. PUTS IT IN THE SAME POSITION BRICK AND MORTAR. IN LOTUS I'M GONNA THE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE BUT I HAVE- CONCERNS- THAT I THINK CAN GET RESOLVED- AND MAYBE NOT BUT I THINK THEY CAN GET RESOLVED AND I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS BEFORE THIS HITS THE FLOOR YEAH I'M I'M HAPPY TO AND IF YOU HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS LET ME KNOW LET'S. LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. ALL RIGHT. A BRIEF CLOSE IF YOU WOULD LIKE SIGNAL FOR I'M SORRY SENATOR. MELINDA IS I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I. WE ONLY HAVE WE HAVE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS. I'M FOR THE AND RECESSION YOU GONNA HAVE TIME TO MAKE. THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO. EVERYONE PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF SESSION. EIGHT DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT'S BEING OFFERED TO THE BILL COULD GO FOR OKAY I'M JUST THE BILL COULD GO FORWARD TODAY UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT SOME CHANGES WILL BE MADE BUT THOSE CHANGES MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BE MADE. WELL I AM NOT CONVINCED THOSE CHANGES ARE NECESSARY OKAY BUT IF I AM CONVINCED OF THOSE CHANGES ARE NECESSARY YES WE DO IN FACT HAVE TIME. IN THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S GOD THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST HAVE ONE BILL. ON THIS THERE WILL BE AS THE MARKET PLACE CHANGES AS WE SEE TECHNOLOGY. MOVING DIRECTIONS SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN CAMPAIGN TO IS PAID I'M SURE THESE ISSUES WILL BE. BROUGHT UP. IN WHATEVER ITERATION WE FIND OURSELVES I MEAN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT- LEARNING WOOD GIGABYTES ARE AND ALL THIS KIND OF SERVICE SOMETHING I. NEVER KNEW AND WAS NEVER ANTICIPATED THAT WE WOULD BE LEARNING ABOUT THEM SO I ASSUME THEY'LL BE THE NEXT ITERATION. OF THESE KINDS OF PLATFORMS- IN THAT THERE WILL BE NEW THINGS THAT COME UP WHAT WHAT THIS BILL I THINK TRIES TO DO IS TO PUT IN A FRAMEWORK- THE LOSS OF ABOUT STRICTLY ABILITY THAT APPLY. EVEN THOUGH THESE MARKET PLACES ARE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN CONCEPT. THERE ARE NO BRICK AND MORTAR SHE GO ON TO YOUR COMPUTER YOU CAN ORDER BIRTHDAY CARDS GREAT IDEA FOR FAMILY THAT YOU. YOU DON'T WANT TO SENDING BACK THE GIFT YOU GIVE THEM SO YOU GIVE A GIFT CARD YOU CAN DO THAT IN. GET OFF TWO MINUTES- NOT ANYTHING YOU EVER THOUGHT OF BEFORE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THERE ARE SOME BASIC FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND THAT'S WHAT I% THINK THIS BILL. TRIES TO DEAL WITH SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE I THINK OF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CONCLUDED CAN I THINK. WE'RE SO IN LOVE WITH THIS NOTION OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE THINK THAT'S THE ONLY INNOVATION THAT HAS HAPPENED IT HASN'T AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF GOODS. AND HOW PRODUCTS GET TO MARKET OVER MELANIA IT'S CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY. WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AMWAY MODEL DISTRIBUTION WE WOULD BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. IF YOU LOOK AT AVON AND SOME OF THAT THE INTERESTING KINDS OF THINGS THAT ENTREPRENEURS CAME UP WITH. WITHOUT THESE. NEW TOOLS. THESE ARE JUST NEW TOOLS THAT THEY DON'T CREATE.
