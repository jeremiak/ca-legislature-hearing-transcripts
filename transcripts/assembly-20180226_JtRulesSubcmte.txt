TWO HOUSES KIND OF SHARING THAT RESPONSIBILITY. I JUST VERY BRIEFLY WANTED TO KIND OF REMIND US ALL OF THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE TAKING. ON THAT I'M CHAIR. IN THIS HEARING PROCESS OUR FIRST TWO HEARINGS FOCUSED ON REVIEWING BEST PRACTICES FOR CHANGING CULTURE ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ON DEFINING HARASSMENT I DID A FINE CHALLENGES AND OF COURSE TODAY'S HEARING WAS GONNA FOCUS I REPORTED A PROVIDING VICTIM SUPPORT. BUT ARE LAST HEARING YOU MAY RECALL I RAISED THE QUESTION ABOUT. HOW WE MANAGE AND HANDLE THE ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT AND REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AS? IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT THE CHARGE OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE A RECOMMENDATION ON A NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE CAPITAL. A NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS THAT BOTH HOUSES WILL BUY INTO SO WHETHER YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE AND YOU WORK IN THE SENATE OR THE ASSEMBLY. YOU WILL KNOW ABOUT THE NEW. BICAMERAL. PROCESS BY WHICH THESE ISSUES WILL BE HANDLED I'M I'M HOPING TODAY'S WITNESSES TODAY'S GROUP OF EXPERTS. AROUND THE REPORTING ISSUE CAN TOUCH A BASIS ON. CAN TOUCH ON THE ISSUE AROUND. OF ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS. IF INDEED THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE. ARM OR IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY WE CAN REALLY GET AT THIS ISSUE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING ON THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH TECHNOLOGY IS NOW BEING USED TO SUPPORT OUR REPORTING. AND JUST WILL JOIN YOU IN THANKING ALL THE WITNESSES WHO WILL BE JOINING US TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO LEARN AND BROUGHT MY OWN SKILL SET AND HORIZONS IN TERMS OF HOW WE. STEVE INFORMATION AND FIGURE OUT A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN BUILD A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR BOTH HOUSES OF OUR LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO ANY OF THE OTHER HOME MEMBERS WANT TO SPEAK. YES SENATOR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK SENATOR MITCHELL. FOR A LITTLE PRIVATE CONVERSATION WE HAD ON. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH? IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW IT'S A GOOD LISTENING. TIME. OUT MANAGER LAST WEEK IN THE SENATE WE HAD A RATHER UNIQUE HISTORICAL EVENT. AND SO I STARTED GOING THROUGH. SOME OF THE LITERATURE THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN AS. OUR OWN TRAINING. I IN THE SENATE. AND AND TRYING TO READ THROUGH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND AND AND AND I'LL ALSO LISTENING TO SOME OF THE CRITICISMS LIKE THE LA TIMES SAYING. YOU KNOW THERE'S REALLY NOT CLARITY AND THAT BECAME MY CONCLUSION IF WE WERE TO HAVE SPOKEN ON THE FLOOR THANK. IT'S VERY VAGUE SO AS WE LISTEN I'M WONDERING MADAM CHAIR IF WE JUST. IF WE START BUILDING ONE OF THOSE DASHBOARDS AND SAID THIS IS A GOOD IDEA WHEN YOU TO IMPLEMENT WE ARE TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE MIX. WHEN WE DEVELOP POLICIES OR MAYBE IF I COULD HAVE PERMISSION AT TIMES TO SAY HEY HAVE YOU READ OUR POLICY AND WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE. AS WE. BUILD TOWARDS SOMETHING. THAT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TALL AMIDST THOSE ARE MY ANDREAS ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S REALLY GREAT INPUT AND WE HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY TAKING NOTES. WHENEVER ONE OF THE MANY MEMBERS MENTIONS AN IDEA THAT THEY'D LIKE TO BRING BACK FOR DISCUSSION ARE MAKE SURE IS INCORPORATED AS WE MOVE OUR POLICIES FOR IT AND I ENCOURAGE. ALL OF YOU TO FEEL FREE TO DO THAT AND CERTAINLY TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PANELISTS THEY'RE HERE TO BE RESOURCES. ANTA TO YOU KNOW WHY I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN WATCHING WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING HERE AND DEFINITELY HAVE OPINIONS. ABOUT THE WAY WE DO THINGS AND THE WAY THAT YOU KNOW THEY WOULD RECOMMEND FOR CERTAIN CHANGES BE MADE SO I YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR TIME WITH THEM TO REALLY. GET THE MOST THAT WE CANNOT OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR EXPERIENCE. MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. JUST REALLY BRIEFLY BEING ABLE TO HEAR ABOUT BEST PRACTICES FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS VERY CRITICAL OF THEM. YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD THAT WE'RE AT THIS POINT BOMB IN OUR HEARINGS. ONE OF THE BIG THINGS IS THE CONFUSION INVOLVED WITH YOU KNOW. AN INCIDENT HAPPENS AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT IT'S NOT BLACK AND WHITE THERE'S SO MANY LAYERS IN NOTICES. SOMETHING I SHOULD TALK ABOUT IS IT WORTH BRINGING FORWARD USED DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT AND I CALL IT THE THREE R'S. THE RESPECT. THE RESPECT FOR THE VICTIM AND WHAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH RESOURCES HAVING RESOURCE AVAILABLE AND THEN RESOLUTION WHICH IS GETTING TO. YOU KNOW. THE THE END OF IT GETTING A RESOLUTION FOR THE VICTIM. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE FOR NOW. TERRIFIC I'M. THAT ONE THING THAT I WILL ALSO MENTION IS AN ISSUE THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE PALACE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IS WHETHER. WHATEVER THE PENALTIES THAT ARE. TO ANY OF THESE ISSUES. EVER PREVENTS A WITNESS FROM COMING FORWARD. YOU KNOW IT WHETHER THAT PERSONALLY A FAX. VICTIM BECAUSE OF MAYBE THE PERSON'S EMPLOYER OR WHETHER THEY'RE WORRIED OF YOU KNOW THEY WANT A CERTAIN TYPE OF RESPONSE ARE AFRAID THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET IT SO THAT WOULD BE TO SOMETHING I WOULD. THROW OUT AS MAYBE SOMETHING FOR SOME OF THE PANELISTS DISCUSS IN WITHOUT AN OCCULT OUR FIRST PANELIST. OUR OUR LET THEM INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND THEY COME UP FROM THE FIRST PANEL IS ON BEST PRACTICES AND CHALLENGES TO REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. NEWTON NEW XIN NATHAN THAT THE US CHIEF TALENT OFFICER AND CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICER FOR THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IN LOS ANGELES. COUNTY AND ASHLEY KLEIN JIMENEZ PROJECT MANNER MANAGER FOR CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND IS ALWAYS WILL HOLD OUR QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE PANELISTS PRESENTATIONS. AND. WITHOUT I WILL INVITE OUR PANEL TO. I TO SPEAK OF MS I'M NATHAN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIRWOMAN FRIEDMAN AND CHAIRWOMAN MITCHELL AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I KNEW XIN NATHAN. I CHIEF TALENT OFFICER OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. I APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT CHARM. THE WORLD'S LARGEST HR PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY REPRESENTING TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND MEMBERS INCLUDING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IN CALIFORNIA. SURE MEMBERS IN TURN INFLUENCED THE LIVES OF OVER A HUNDRED MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN THE WORKFORCE. ABOUT ONE IN THREE AMERICANS. IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE NINETEEN NINETIES THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE WORKPLACE ROSE TO SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS. IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN THE CASE OF HARRIS VERSUS FORKLIFT SYSTEMS INC THE US SUPREME COURT RULED THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT WAS NOT LIMITED TO ACTS THAT RESULT IN PHYSICAL. OR SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY. THEREBY INCLUDING PERVASIVE SEXIST REMARKS INNUENDO AND ADVANCES UNDER THE DEFINITION OF ABUSIVE OR HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. AT THE END OF THE OTHER END OF THE DECADE IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WITH BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES. VERSUS ALLER IF AND FACT FARAGHER VERSUS CITY OF BOCA RATON THE SUIT SUPREME COURT RULED THAT EMPLOYERS ARE LIABLE. FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT EVEN WHERE NO PROFESSIONALLY ADVERSE ACTION AGAINST THE CLAIMANT OCCURRED. HOWEVER THE EMPLOYER MAY DEFEND ITSELF BY SHOWING IT TOOK MEASURES TO PREVENT OR IMMEDIATELY CORRECT ANY SUCH INSTANCES. BUT THE NEED FOR EMPLOYER TO PROTECT ITS EMPLOYEES AND DEFEND ITSELF. SO THE SEAT FOR HUMAN RESOURCES IMPLEMENTING PROCEDURES ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. THESE GREAT CHANGES IN OUR LAWS IN OUR HISTORY AND CULTURE. WERE BROUGHT ABOUT BY MANY BRAVE PEOPLE. PARTICULARLY WOMEN WHO ARE NOT AFRAID TO VOICE THEIR EXPERIENCES UNTIL THEY WERE HURT. BUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS NOT LIMITED TO WOMEN. IT HAPPENS TO MEN AND THOSE WHOSE GENDER IDENTITY FALLS ANYWHERE ON THAT SPECTRUM. IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANY OF US. COMMON WORKPLACE BREAK BASS RESPONSES BY THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE SEX SEX BASED HARASSMENT ARE TO AVOID THE HARASSER. DENY OR DOWNPLAY THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION. OR ATTEMPT TO IGNORE FORGET OR INDOOR THE BEHAVIOR. THE FEAR DISBELIEF. OF THEIR CLAIM. IN ACTION ON THEIR CLAIM. BLAME OR SOCIAL OR PROFESSIONAL RETALIATION. I SERUMS CEO AND PRESIDENT JOHNNY C. TAYLOR NOTED IN JANUARY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. CULTURE TRUMP'S POLICY. AND WORKPLACES MUST CREATE A HOLISTIC CULTURE OF NON HARASSMENT THAT STARTS AT THE TOP. PART OF HAVING A POSITIVE AND PRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE IS ENSURING THAT WHEN SOMEONE FEELS THEY HAVE BEEN A VICTIM OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. OR HAS WITNESSED HARASSMENT OR BEHAVIOR THAT VIOLATES VIOLATES THE CULTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION. THE EMPLOYER HAS A PROCESS TO ADDRESS ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS BEST PREVENTED AND CONFRONTED WHEN THE CHANNELS ARE COMMUNICATION ARE SAFE. SWIFT AND UNENCUMBERED. THEREFORE THE FIRST AND MOST CRITICAL STEP FOR CHANGING CULTURE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS PROVIDING AND ACCESSIBLE REPORTING PROCESS. FOR THOSE CONFRONTING HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM AND HIM OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY PROVIDES ITSELF PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS COLLEGIAL ENVIRONMENT. WE ENCOURAGE OUR EMPLOYEES TO SHARE THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT WORKPLACE ISSUES WITH COLLEAGUES REGARDLESS OF STANDING. IF SUCH CONCERNS REQUIRE GUIDANCE OR GRIEVE IN NATURE SUCH AS WORKPLACE HARASSMENT ARE SUPERVISORS MANAGERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO BRING THE INFORMATION TO HUMAN RESOURCE SAID. WE SHOULD RESOURCES AND A DISCREET AND TIMELY MANNER. IN ADDITION TO ENCOURAGING AN OPEN DOOR POLICY WE HAVE RECENTLY LAUNCHED A PROGRAM CALLED SPEAK UP AND HM. ANY CHANCE STANDS FOR NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM. WE IMPLEMENTED THIS PROGRAM LAST YEAR AS A WAY OF COMMITMENT TO OUR VALUE OF INCLUSIVITY AND ALLOWING MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF HEARING AND LISTENING TO THE GOOD THE CONCERNS OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. THIS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN PROGRAM IS OPERATED BY A THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATION. ALLOWING OUR EMPLOYEES TO REPORT ANY WORKPLACE ISSUES WITH THE OPTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND ANONYMITY. ONCE A CLAIM HAS BEEN MADE OVER THE PHONE OR THROUGH EMAIL THE COLOR REALLY RECEIVE A CASE NUMBER AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR FOLLOW UP. THE MATTER WILL BEND THEN BE FORWARDED TO ME FOR REVIEW INVESTIGATION AND ACTION. THE RESPONSE WILL CONTAIN SPECIFICS ON WHAT. ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN OR WILL BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN. WE'VE EVEN TAKEN MEASURES TO ALLOW FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO FILE A COMPLAINT ABOUT ANYONE IN THE HR DEPARTMENT. WHICH ARE THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATION WILL FORWARD TO OUR GENERAL COUNSEL FOR REVIEW. THIS PROGRAM AND OTHERS LIKE AT ARE A MEANS OF EMPLOYEES ARE OUR NEEDS FOR EMPLOYEES TO REPORT WITHOUT SHAME OR FEAR OF RETALIATION. AND WITH THE OPTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY. THERE'S NO NEED TO REPORT THE ISSUE TO YOUR SUPERVISOR OR EVEN YOUR SUPERVISOR'S SUPERVISOR IF THE EMPLOYEE DOESN'T WANT TO. PROVIDING A SERVICE LIKE THE SIGNALS TO EMPLOYEES THAT THEIR CONCERNS MATTER AND WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. IT EXEMPLIFIES OUR CONTINUOUS EFFORTS TO HEAR THE VOICES OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE. IT ALSO HELPS LAY A FOUNDATION OF TRUST AND BUILDS A CULTURE THAT IS CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE A SAFE. AND COLLABORATIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT IS FREE FROM HARASSMENT. THROUGH WHATEVER MEANS ACCLAIM HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT CLEAN MUST BE HANDLED THROUGH CONSISTENT PROCEDURES. HAVING PROCEDURES IN PLACE INSURERS THAT THE CLAIM THAT FLOW THROUGH A PREDICTABLE CYCLE. IN GENERAL THAT CYCLE SHOULD INCLUDE THE CLAIM THE INVESTIGATION THE FINDINGS AND CORRECTIVE ACTION. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION MUST BE PROPERLY DOCUMENTED. DOCUMENTATION SERVICE TO FUNCTIONS IT ASSISTS IN THE DETERMINATION OF CORRECTIVE ACTION TO BE TAKEN. AND IS EVIDENCE THAT ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN. SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF ANY KIND IS ALWAYS SERIOUS AND SHOULD ACCORDINGLY BE TREATED AS SUCH. REGARDLESS OF THE HIERARCHY WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION. IT SHOULD NOT MATTER TO WHOM THE CLAIM WAS MADE. ONCE IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THE PROCESSOR OF THE INFORMATION MUST TAKE IT TO THOSE WHO WILL PERFORM AN UNBIASED INVESTIGATION. THAT INVESTIGATION MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE IN NATURE. AND YET LIMITED IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED. TOO MANY PARTICIPANTS MAY NOT ONLY CONTAMINATE THE INVESTIGATIONS. AB. BUT MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT EMPLOYEES TRUST AND DAY TO DAY EXPERIENCE AMONG HIS OR HER PEERS. YET IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO RESPOND. IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT. PREVENTION REQUIRES EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF OUR EMPLOYEES. AND MANAGERS HOWEVER EVEN EFFECTIVE TRAINING CANNOT OCCUR IN A VACUUM IN MUST BE PART OF THE HOLISTIC CULTURE. OF NON HARASSMENT THAT STARTS AT THE TOP. WHEN THE TERM SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS USE WHAT COMES TO MIND OF MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT THIS SMALLER BUT PERSISTENT AND INTOLERABLE ACTS IT IS THE EXTREME ACTS THE OX WE HEAR ABOUT ON THE NEWS THAT COME TO MIND. ROGER AILES BILL COSBY. BILL REILLY HARVEY WEINSTEIN YET HARASSMENT CAN TAKE MANY FORMS AND EMPLOYEES NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BEHAVIOR THAT MAY BE SMALLER IN SCOPE BUT STILL PERSISTENT. AND INTO IT AN INTOLERABLE ACTS OF HARASSMENT. WE MUST THEREFORE DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES HARASSMENT FROM THE BEGINNING OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S EMPLOYMENT. WE MUST PROVIDE THEM WITH THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS. WHY IT IS A PROBLEM HOODOO REPORTED TO HOW IT WILL BE ADDRESSED WHERE THEY CAN FIND ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND WHEN TO EXPECT CLOSURE? THIS IS THE KEY TO ENSURING THAT OUR ACCESS AND PROCEDURES ARE PROPERLY UTILIZED. EDUCATION MIGHT MUST TAKE THE FORM OF CLEAR AND PUBLIC A WRITTEN POLICY. EASY TO LOCATE AND EASY TO REFERENCE. EDUCATION SHOULD BE INTERACTIVE. I CANNOT SHY AWAY FROM TOPICS THAT MAKE US UNCOMFORTABLE WE MUST SPEAK ABOUT IT FREELY. AND EMPOWER ALL MANAGERS TO HELP EFFECTIVELY BUT CONFIDENCE AND COMPASSION. WE MUST INFUSE CIVILITY WITHOUT A WITHIN OUR WORK CULTURE AND EMPOWER OUR COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK UP AS BYSTANDERS WITNESSING UNWELCOME BEHAVIORS. WHAT'S A CLAIM HAS BEEN MADE WE ARE NOW ON NOTICE TOPPED. THE LONGER IT TAKES TO RESPOND TO A SEXUAL A LOT HARASSMENT CLAIM THE LESS FAITH AN INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINANT HIGHS IN HR'S RESPONSE. WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT FAITH TO BECOME BRITTLE. WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO LIVE UP TO IT. NEVER THE LESS MORE HUMAN AND IN PERFECT. WEAKNESSES IN POLICY AND PROCEDURES MAY AND WILL BE DISCOVERED EARLY ALONG THE WAY. THEY SHOULD BE CORRECTED AS THEY ARE DISCOVERED AND THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AUDITED REGULARLY IN BETWEEN. LEADERSHIP MUST ASK ITSELF IS THIS PROTOCOL NECESSARY IS IT EFFICIENT. HOW DO WE GAUGE OUR CURRENT EDUCATIONS EFFECTIVENESS? SHOULD WE DO A FOCUS GROUP. AN ANONYMOUS SURVEY HOW CAN WE BEST COMMUNICATES EVERYONE ANY CHANGES. IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR EMPLOYEES TO HOLD THEIR LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE LEADERS MUST HOLD THEMSELVES AND THEIR PEERS TO THE SAME STANDARDS. THIS REQUIRES UNIVERSAL COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING A HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES MANAGERS TO BE RETRAINED IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS. WHILE THIS LAWS IMPORTANT IT CANNOT REPLACE THE ROLE THAT LEADERSHIP AND THE ORGANIZATION PLAYS IN CREATING AND MAINTAINING A POLICY. THAT INCLUDES ACCESS PROCEDURES AND EDUCATION. OUR SENIOR LEADERS MUST LEAD BY EXAMPLE FOR THE SET THE TONE OF ANY ORGANIZATION ABOVE AND BEYOND THE LAW WITH BEST PRACTICES. LEADERS MUST SELL SERVE AS ROLE MODELS FOR A DIVERSE INCLUSIVE AND RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE BY REFUSING TO TOLERATE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR. BY ADDRESSING IT. SPEEDY AT LEE WHEN IT OCCURS. AND POPULAR CULTURE HUMAN RESOURCES IS OFTEN THE RUNNING JOKE. THE DEPARTMENT TO BE FEARED OR SCORNED AS UNNECESSARY TASK MASTERS. HR DEPARTMENTS NEED TO CONSISTENTLY REVIEW IMPROVE AN ADVOCATE FOR PROGRAMS THAT CREATE AND FOSTER A SAFE PRODUCTIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT. THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO CO ELEVATING OUR COLLEAGUES. IT HAS OFTEN BEEN SAID THAT THE PITFALL OF HARVEY WEINSTEIN IN HOLLYWOOD WASN'T WATERSHED MOMENT. BUT WE WILL HAVE MANY MORE SUCH MOMENTS AS OUR CHILDREN NURTURE THE WISDOM VESTED IN THEM. WE SEE IT NOW IN THE MEAT TO AND NEVER AGAIN MOVEMENTS. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REMAIN ON BLUSHING BY THE CONTEMPT OF SOCIAL MEDIA. OR POLITICAL PROVOCATEURS WILL BRING US CLOSER TO RESTORING JUSTICE IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I REMAIN OPTIMISTIC IN MY VIEW THAT WE CAN STILL BRING CHANGES AS PROFESSIONALS. AS IMPERFECT BUT AMBITIOUS HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT THE FUTURE BUT INDEED HOLD A MORE KIND SELF AWARE AND JUST WORKED. SURE PLEDGES TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AS IT ADDRESSES THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I CLIMBED A MENACE. THAT AFTERNOON HERE MANY. HER CHAIRMAN JOHN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ASHLEY KIND JIMENEZ AND I AM A PROJECT MANAGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT OR ODDS WERE MORE COMMONLY KNOWN CAL CASA. AND ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY MY COLLEAGUE JOHN FINLEY. COME CASA PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND VISION AND RESOURCES TO EIGHTY FOUR RAPE CRISIS CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND A VARIETY OF INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE NATION COMMITTED TO ENDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN ALL ITS FORMS. SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS A FORM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THAT IMPACTS SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS' BEYOND THAT THE INCIDENT. AB HOW CASA WE WORK TO CENTER THE NEEDS OF SURVIVORS THROUGH A TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACH THIS APPROACH RECOGNIZES THE IMPACT OF TRAUMA ON THE SURVIVOR. AND ACTIVELY RESISTS RETRY MONETIZING NAM. WHEN IT COMES TO REPORTING INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT SURVIVORS FEES NUMEROUS BARRIERS AND MANY SURVIVORS DELAY REPORTING FOR VARIOUS REASONS. ONE OF THE REASONS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND THE INTIMATE NATURE OF THE INCIDENT. IT IS COMMON FOR SURVIVORS TO FEEL ASHAMED AND EMBARRASSED OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SHARE WITH ANYONE. ADDITIONALLY INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT KNOW THEIR RIGHTS OR THE PROPHECIES FOR FILING A COMPLAINT. AND MAY EXPERIENCE NORMAL REACTIONS TO TRAUMA THAT CAN INCLUDE IGNORING OR BURYING THE SEXUAL. VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND CONTINUE IN THEIR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES. IT IS IMPORTANT NOT SURVIVORS ARE PROVIDED WITH CONFIDENTIAL RESOURCES FOR SUPPORT AND THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE VARIOUS REMEDIES PROPHECIES AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. SURVIVORS MAY ALSO CHOOSE NOT TO REPORT OR DELAY REPEATS REPORTING OUT OF FEAR SPECIFICALLY FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES. SURVIVORS MAY FEAR LOSING THEIR JOB AND EXPERIENCING RETALIATION FROM THEIR EMPLOYER IN COLOR CARS AS WELL AS THE PERSON WHO CAUSE THEM HARM. THERE IS A FEARING BEING LABELED A TROUBLEMAKER AND THE IMPACTS THAT CAN HAVE ON SOMEONE'S PROFESSIONAL CAREER. THERE'S ALSO FEAR THAT THEY WILL NOT BE BELIEVED OR IF THEY ARE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. COMPLAINTS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN BRUSHED OFF HIS JOKES. I OR NOT A BIG DEAL OR JUST HOW THINGS ARE. SURVIVORS ALSO HOLE NUMEROUS SOCIAL IDENTITIES INCLUDING RACE NATIONALITY SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS GENDER IDENTITIES SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND LANGUAGE. HISTORICAL IN MULTI GENERATIONAL OPPRESSION BASED ON THESE AYE DENNIS DIS INTERSECT WITH SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND CAN CAUSE FURTHER BARRIERS AND REPORTING. SURVIVORS MAY FEEL THAT THE PERSONAL SOCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARE FAR TO GREET. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WORRY THAT THE COMPLETE WILL NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. WELL THE TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THE BARRIERS REPORTING ARE VERY REAL THERE ARE STEPS THAT EMPLOYERS CAN TAKE TO ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND START TO SHIFT THE CULTURE TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SURVIVORS ARE SUPPORTED. OUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT CAN BE PREVENTED. STRONG POLICY CENTER CLEAR MESSAGE THAT ORGANIZATIONS WILL SUPPORT SURVIVORS AND HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE HARM THEY HAVE CAUSED. WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT POLICIES CAN BE OVERRIDDEN WHEN UNDERLYING BELIEFS AND VALUES THAT HAVE SUPPORTED A CULTURE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARE NOT ADDRESSED. EMPLOYERS SHOULD ESTABLISH CLEAR POLICIES THAT ARE COMMUNICATED EFFECTIVELY APPLIED CONSISTENTLY AND REVIEW OFTEN AND PROMOTE A CULTURE OF RESPECT WHERE EVERYONE IS VALUED. THIS REQUIRES SHIFTING AWAY FROM NORMS THAT VALUE CLEANING AND MAINTAINING MAINTAINING POWER OVER OTHERS TO NORMS THAT SUPPORT EQUITY. LEADERSHIP CAN MODEL RESPECT FOR PEOPLE'S BOUNDARIES ENCOURAGE BYSTANDERS TO SPEAK UP AND MAKE SAFETY FOR ALL A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. ON GOING TRAINING WHICH IS SOMETHING NOT HOW CASA PROVIDES SHOULD ALSO BE PROVIDED TO LEADERSHIP AND SUPERVISORS ON HOW TO PROMOTE A POSITIVE RESPECTFUL IN SAFE CLIMATE FOR EMPLOYEES. ALL EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE PROVIDED TRAINING ON HOW TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND SPEAK UP WHEN THE WITNESS HARMFUL BEHAVIORS. LEADERS CAN CONDUCT CONFIDENTIAL ANONYMOUS SURVEYS TO GATHER INFORMATION ON ORGANIZATIONAL CONDITIONS IDENTIFY AREAS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT AND DRIVE ACTION TO IMPROVE THE CLIMATE EXPERIENCE BY EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYERS CAN ALSO BE PROACTIVE BY MAKING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT AND ONGOING CONVERSATION. SILENCE ALLOWS PEOPLE TO GO UNCHECKED CONDONES UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR AND MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO. TALKING OPENLY AND REGULARLY ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT SHIFTS THE CULTURE OF VIOLENCE THAT AS WELL ALLOWED SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO FLOURISH. WE ONLY HAVE TO LOOK TO COLLEGE CAMPUSES TO SEE HOW A CULTURAL SHIFT AROUND SILENCE CAN ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REPORT SEXUAL VIOLENCE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVE COMMITTED TO BETTER ADDRESSING PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE. MANY HAVE SEEN INCREASES IN REPORTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN NOT MORE SEXUAL ASSAULT HAVE OCCURRED BUT RATHER THAT CAMPUSES HAVE STARTED TO CREATE CLAIMANTS WHERE SURVIVORS ARE MORE COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD AND REPORTING THEIR EXPERIENCES. THIS IS A GOOD THING. WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE THE ROLE INSTITUTIONS AND WORKS TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS ENVIRONMENTS WHERE WOMEN A ROUTINELY ISOLATED AND INTIMIDATED ARE RIGHT FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE. IN CLOSING SUPPORTING SURVIVORS IS CRUCIAL FOR PROMOTING A CULTURE OF INTOLERANCE FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE WE MUST PAY ATTENTION TO THE VARYING EXPERIENCES AND NEEDS OF SURVIVORS. AND WE MUST ALSO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL AND CULTURAL NORMS THAT HAVE ALLOWED SEXUAL VIOLENCE RUNS RAMPANT IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND COMMUNITIES AND COMMIT TO CHANGING NAM. THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO QUESTIONS NOW AND I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST TO START OFF. SO CLEARLY THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO. ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD HERE THERE WAS SEXUAL VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AYE IN THE ASSEMBLY SUPERVISORS ARE GIVEN AN EXTRA TWENTY MINUTES OF TRAINING. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN TWENTY MINUTES MAYBE ALL YOU CAN DO IS TELL THEM HOW TO REPORT. AND BY THE WAY WE DON'T REQUIRE PEOPLE TO REPORT TO THE SUPERVISORS THAT CAN ACTUALLY REPORT DIRECTLY TO HUMAN RESOURCES THEY CAN REPORT TO A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. BUT IT SEEMS THAT GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF OF HELPING PEOPLE. FACE THOSE CHALLENGES THAT IS A LOT OF ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY ON MANDATORY REPORTERS AND SUPERVISORS TO KNOW HOW TO. TAKE THOSE REPORTS AND TO MAKE EVERYONE THAT THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE IS A WAY TO REPORT THAT THAT YOU KNOW HOME AND AND TO BE MORE ENCOURAGING OF REPORTING WENT WHEN THESE WHEN. THERE ARE. ISSUES IN THE WORKPLACE SO WHAT WHAT DOES. COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING LOOK LIKE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS THERE ANY BEST STANDARD OUT THERE. PACIFIC WE FOR MANDATORY REPORTERS AND SUPERVISORS. I I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE SAME TYPE OF TRAINING MAYBE THAT'S GIVEN TO TO THE MEMBER THE PEOPLE WANT WE'VE HER ARE ON THE OTHER END OF THE TELEPHONE OR WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF HOW WHAT WE CAN LOOK TO. TO BEEF UP WHAT'S CLEARLY. I AT THIS POINT IN AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF TRAINING THAT'S GIVEN TO THE THAT SORT OF FRONT LINE OF INDIVIDUALS. SURE THINK YOU CHAIR FRIEDMAN. SO I WOULD SAY THAT I. BECAUSE I CAL BECAUSE SO WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON. PROVIDING A TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACH I FIND NOT TO BE. A VERY SIGNIFICANT PLACE TO START IS HAVING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN SOMEONE COMES FORWARD TO REPORT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THERE'S A LOT OF TRAUMA THAT IS ALSO COMING WITH THAT. AND. WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY NEED JUST BORN KNOWING HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE AND THEIR TRAUMA. AND SO TRAINING AROUND WHAT TRAUMA LOOKS LIKE HOW TRAUMA IMPACTS PEOPLE ON IS IS IT CAN'T BE DONE IN TWENTY MINUTES AND IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. AIMS WE WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING TOWARDS US HOW PEOPLE RESPOND. TO A SURVIVOR WHEN THEY HAVE TO CLOSE DISCLOSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CAN HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON WHETHER THEY CONTINUE FORWARD. I'M IN THE REPORTING PROCESS WHETHER THEY GET COUNSELING I'M REALLY WHAT THEY DO NEXT TO. DEAL WITH THEIR TRAUMA AND HEAL FROM THAT SO I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND I ALSO THINK THAT. HAVING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND A THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SURVIVORS GIVING PEOPLE OPTIONS GIVING SURVIVORS OPTIONS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S THAT PEOPLE CAN BE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION AND LET THEM KNOW WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AND WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL. TERRIFIC THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. MA'AM. STAY IN ON THE ISSUE OF TRAINING AND AND CULTURE CHANGE IN THE ROLE OF TRAINING WITHIN IT. ALL BUT WHICH I'VE BEEN READING A LOT ABOUT. LOTS OF YOU KNOW MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE ROLE OF TRAINING BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT LACK OF EDUCATION IT'S BEHAVIOR CHANGE. SO I WONDER IF. IT IT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE EXPERIENCE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE TO KIND OF START. BEFORE THE BEGINNING. AS CNN. BEGIN TO AFFECT CULTURE CHANGE IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO. CHECK IMPLICIT BIAS TO TEST IMPLICIT BIAS JUST SO ENSURE GOING TO THE TRAINING EVERYONE HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF UNCLEAR ABOUT. THEIR CURRENT PERCEPTIONS AROUND. GENDER BIAS. BEFORE WE BEGIN TO DIDN'T CORRECT THEIR BEHAVIOR ANY COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE ON THAT EITHER IF YOU. NEVER ACTUALLY AND RIGHT NOW LOOKING AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BRING IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING TO OUR MUSEUM AND ALL STAFF AND. NOW IT THAT THAT DOESN'T JUST ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS IT YOU KNOW ADDRESSES INCLUSIVITY RACE EQUITY SENSE OF BELONGING BRINGING YOUR WHOLE SELF TO WORK. I AM SO ABSOLUTELY SPECIALLY BECAUSE BE SERVED ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE ON IN PUBLIC WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVEN WHEN OUR VISITORS ARE COMING TO THE MUSEUM WHERE NOT. BRINGING OUR OUR BY A CEASE ART THERE ARE IMPLICIT BISI SORT AND IN NOT WELCOMING SET CERTAIN GROUPS. SO I THINK. THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY VERY VITAL TO HAVE CONTINUOUS IMPLICIT BIAS. AND TO CHANGE THOSE AT. CHALLENGE DOES GENERAL IDEAS THAT PEOPLE HIVE OF RULES OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT SEXES RACES. OF ALSO ARE ALL ABOUT. IT DOES I REALLY TAKES UNPACKING I'M SO MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE ALL GROWN UP AND AS A SOCIETY. AND SO THERE IS A LOT OF OF THINKING ABOUT ISSUES BROADER ISSUES OF OPPRESSION AND RULES THAT WE'VE ALL PLAYED. ON AND I AGREE THAT I IT IT'S NOT THE EDUCATION THAT'S THE ISSUE IT'S IT'S HOW WE INTERACT SO IT'S THE SYSTEMS THAT WE PUT INTO PLACE AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE CREATE. ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I WOULD AGREE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO JUST BUILD A SYSTEM. TO REPORT AND CREATE SAFE REPORTING AFTER THE FACT WE HAVE A GOAL AROUND PREVENTION AS WELL SO THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THE QUESTION. IN TERMS OF CULTURE SHIFT IN THE ROLE TRAINEE PLAYS IN THAT TO TWO MORE QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY. UM. TO. METS NATHAN HOW MANY EMPLOYEES OBNOXIOUS MUSEUM OF WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES AND A SEVEN HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS PER ENTOMOLOGIST GOAL. SO OUR VOLUNTEERS INCORPORATED IN NEED TO GO THROUGH TRAIN IN THE REPORTING SO THAT ALL THAT SO YOU'RE STRUCTURE. IMPECCABLE VOLUNTEERS A AN EMPLOYEE TAKE IT DAY TO GO THROUGH TRAINING YOU MENTIONED. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO LIMIT THE NUMBER PARTICIPANTS WAS THE WORD YOU USED. INVESTIGATIONS I ASSUME YOU MEANT THE NUMBER PEOPLE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATE CORRECT OKAY I WANT TO MAKE SURE I WAS CLEAR ABOUT THAT. AND HOW IN BOTH OF YOUR EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU ARE MANAGED ANONYMOUS REPORTING. I HAVE. I HAVE AND THIS NEW SYSTEM THAT WE HIVE SPEAK UP ANY CHEN. EVER SINCE WE INSTITUTED WE HOP HOT ABOUT SEVEN ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS AND THEY'VE BEEN. NOT. THEY'VE BEEN. VERY SOFT TOUCH ISSUES THAT A BIRD BEEN BROUGHT TO US LIKE. A AND MANAGERS BEHAVIOR LET'S SAY TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE'S WEIGHT WHICH WAS INAPPROPRIATE. SO IT HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN HEAVY DUTY. BUT. STILL WE LOOK INTO IT WE ADDRESS SAID RESPOND. AND THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS ANONYMOUSLY REPORTED WILL RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM US. AND AND I. THIS IS PROBABLY AN UNFAIR QUESTION AND I'M GOING TO SAY THAT AND THEN AFTER ANYWAY. GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHY DO YOU ASSUME THOSE WERE ANONYMOUS WAS IT FEAR OF RETALIATION OR WHAT DO YOU THINK MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOST. FACTOR. I AM NOT SURE EXACTLY I THINK NOT SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO THROW OTHER PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS BUT IT'S JUST THAT. IT'S A SMALL BEHAVIOR THAT NEEDS CORRECTION AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN GIVING THEIR NAME GOT IT IN ONE. AND LAST QUESTION FOR ME IN THIS IS DIRECTED TO MS KLEIN JIMENEZ BASING YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH COLLEGES. EVEN. THE POPULATION YOU GET WHAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR PERSPECTIVE WE'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THAT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN A COUPLE OF TOOL THAT ON THE MARKET NEXT. I'M WONDERING. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IF TECHNOLOGY. IS HELPFUL WITH REPORTING. I THINK IT CAN BE I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO ANY LARGE INSTITUTION WHETHER IT'S A COLLEGE OR I'M WHAT HAVE YOU. AYE WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND SO THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE TRAINING THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE CHANGES TO THE ENVIRONMENT BY MY INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICALLY IN AND. APPLICATION BASED FEATURES SO I THINK THAT IT DEFINITELY DEPENDS ON. THE WHAT THE GOALS ARE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CULTURE IS OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO IMPACTS BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THERE CAN BE A PLACE FOR IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THINK YOU FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. I HAVE A QUESTION ON I THINK IT WAS. MISS CLIMB THE MENACE THAT SAID WE NEED TO PUT STRONG POLICIES IN PLACE. SO I'M WONDERING HOW WE DO THAT WHEN WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY HERE AT THE CAPITOL. BUT THAT REALLY HASN'T WORKED AS WE'VE SEEN SO WHAT KIND OF STRONG POLICIES TO BE PUT IN PLACE SO THAT ARE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY ACTUALLY WORKS. BUT I QUESTION IT MIGHT NOT BE AN ISSUE THAT THE POLICY ITSELF IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH BUT AGAIN I THINK I MENTIONED DOT. A CULTURE A TOXIC CULTURE CAN REALLY UNDERMINE EVEN THE PAST POLICY AND SO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. REALLY SHOULD BE AT PLAY ON NOT ONLY ME AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT THE POLICY MAY NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH BUT IS THE POLICY CLEAR IS IT EASY FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU SEE. AS A HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE'S A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. SO I LOOK AT THE OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS. THANK YOU. HE AND SOME OF THE LITERATURE THAT THE. CAO COSTA GAVE AND THEN ALSO MS NATHAN IN YOUR COMMENTS YOU TALKED ABOUT BY STANDARDS BYSTANDERS. IS THERE SPECIFIC TRAINING YOU GIVE TWO BYSTANDERS. AND TELLING THEM WITH THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IS IN REPORTING. BUT THERE IS TRAINING OUT THERE FOR BYSTANDER REPORTING HOWEVER IT'S SOMETHING THAT WEEK WE AND. PRESENT TO ALL EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS WHEN WE DO ANY TYPE OF TRAINING AND IN BUILDING THAT CULTURE THAT VOICES MATTER. AND THAT. THIS IS AB AND ENVIRONMENT THAT IS SAFE FOR ALL EMPLOYEES AND WE TREAT EACH OTHER WITH CIVILITY. SO WITH ITS BUILT IN OUR CULTURE IT IS. YOU KNOW INCLUSIVITY AS ONE OF OUR VALUES SO. IT'S IT'S IT'S WE'RE SURROUNDED BY IT AND WE TRY TO TOUCH IT EVERYTIME WE KAREN. AND AND POWER ARE EMPLOYEES TO BEHAVE IN THOSE WAYS. REALLY LOOK. BYSTANDER INTERVENTION OUT FROM AN ADVOCACY IN PREVENTION PUT ON STANDPOINT AND SO. FOR SO LONG OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE HAS BEEN THIS VERY PRIVATE ISSUE IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. AND SO INCLUDING INVOLVING BYSTANDERS IS REALLY SAYING THAT THIS IS A COMMUNITY ISSUE. WE ALL HAVE A ROLE IN PREVENTING SEXUAL VIOLENCE. AND SO IT'S REALLY PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH THE TOOLS AND THE KNOWLEDGE. TO BE ABLE TO INTERVENE WHETHER ON ITS VERBAL COMMENTS OR AYE PHYSICAL ACT. THAT WOULD CAUSE HARM. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT OPTIONS YOU TALKED ABOUT RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND OPTIONS. ONCE THE PERSON HAS MADE A A REPORT AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT AN ANONYMOUS REPORT BUT A REPORT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ARE THE OPTIONS. LESS AT THAT POINT IN THAT A. DO THEY HAVE LESS OPTIONS OR DO THEY HAVE MORE OPTIONS AT THAT POINT. IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU DO NOT IN THIS REPORT. YOU COULD STILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO CALL THE POLICE YOU COULD STILL DECIDE SO MANY OF THE THINGS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE INVOLVED OR NOT. ONCE YOU'VE MADE THE REPORT NOW ARE THEY IN THIS SYSTEM AND THEY HAVE TO NOW GO THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING OFFERED. AND FOR US AND WHEN WE RECEIVE A COMPLAINT ABOUT HARASSMENT AND. WE WE TRY TO CREATE A SPACE FOR A THAT INDIVIDUAL TO FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THAT AND THEN. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. I WILL ASK IS. DO YOU FEEL SAFE RIGHT NOW IN THIS SITUATION AS WE CONDUCT THIS INVESTIGATION AND FIND OUT THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT HAS OCCURRED. SO IN THAT SPACE OF TIME BEFORE SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION IN A TIMELY MANNER. BECAUSE. YOU'RE YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE THAT THAT PERSON IS WORKING. AROUND PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE PERPETUATED NOT ACT. SO IT'S CRITICAL FOR HR DEPARTMENT OR WHOEVER IS HANDLING YOUR AND RESPONSE TO. TO TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE WITH THE VICTIM. GOING TO ASK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE ANONYMOUS IF I MAY. ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS. I. I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING COMPLETELY HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN. IF SOMEONE WANTS TO REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THEY CALL THE HOTLINE. IS THE INVESTIGATION OF YOU SAID EARLIER ABOUT THAT THOSE ARE SOFT COMPLAINTS ARE SOFT THEY HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN HIDE MANY MAJOR. YOU KNOW BIG ISSUES THEY'VE BEEN YOU KNOW I JUST IN LIKE. HOW THIS PERSON SAID THIS? SO EACH IS AN ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT TREATED THE SAME AS. A FACE TO FACE COMPLAINED NORMALLY. AND SO THE WAY IT'S HANDLED IS WE'VE HIRED A THIRD PARTY WHO RECEIVES THE COMPLAINT. AND THEY REALLY THAT INFORMATION TO US AND I'M ABLE TO SEND A RESPONSE TO THIS ANONYMOUS COME COMPLAINANT. UP WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING WHO THEY ARE SO WE STILL CAN HAVE DIALOGUE WITHOUT. ME KNOWING WHO IS FILE THAT COMPLAIN AND ASK QUESTIONS AND AND MAYBE ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME FORWARD IF IT'S IF IT'S A REALLY GRAVE AND YOU KNOW. INCIDENT THAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM. AND THAT I PROVIDE THE RESPONSE AFTER. INVESTIGATION AND ACTION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. AND USE THAT INFORMATION DISCOVERABLE. I AM YES I MEAN IT'S NOT CLOAKED UNDER ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE COMMUNICATION SO NOWADAYS. ALRIGHT SO EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE COMPLAINING ANONYMOUSLY. THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS EVENTUALLY THEIR IDENTITY COULD BE. DETERMINED. I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION FOR AN ATTORNEY I HAVE NOT THOUGHT THAT THROUGH. BUT GOOD BECAUSE MY QUESTION IS WHO WHO IS THE OWNER OF THAT INFORMATION RIGHT IS IT TO THE ORGANIZATION LIKE HERE THE STATE THAT HIRES THAT. ENTITY TO ACCEPT THE ANONYMOUS. COMPLAINTS OR DOES IT BELONG TO THAT ENTITY. THAT THAT IS A A CONCERN FOR ME WARM. AND AYE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT I DO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GET THAT FOR YOU I'M HAPPY ONE TO FOLLOW AT. BUT I WOULD I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR KNOW THAT WE'VE STARTED. THE WE'VE. PROGRAM BUT THAT IS THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU FOR SAYING WERE. KEEPING IT ANONYMOUS O. BUT IT IS DISCOVERABLE O. LEGALLY THEN. THEY NEED TO NOTE THAT THE VICTIM THAT MAKES THE REPORT. DOES NEED TO KNOW. I JUST IT JUST AN OBSERVATION WHEN YOU'RE GIVING YOUR YOUR YOUR TALK MS OF NATHAN. A LOT OF WHICH HE SAID HAD TO DO WITH THE LETTER C.. CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION COLLEGIALITY IN TRUST CONFIDENTIALITY CONSISTENT PROCEDURES COMPREHENSIVE INVEST INVESTIGATION A CULTURE OF NON HARASSMENT AND CIVILITY. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LETTER C.. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE I MOVE TO THE NEXT. PANEL A PEOPLE PERSON APPEARS WANNA ASK A QUESTION ON BECAUSE SOMETHING. SOME MEMBER REYES MENTIONED ABOUT THE ANONYMOUS REPORTING. HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE WHEN REPORTS COME IN. THERE'S ACTUALLY WROTE A REPORT PUT INTO PERSONNEL FILE. ABOUT ALL KINDS OF INCIDENTS IN REPORTS. HOW DO YOU? PUT ANONYMOUS REPORTS AND IN A PERSONNEL FILE SOMEWHERE AND IF SO HOW YOU HAVE DUE PROCESS WITHOUT. THE. I'M A PERSON WHO'S BEEN ACCUSED BEING ABLE TO EVEN KNOW WHO THE INDIVIDUAL IS WOULD YOU ONLY ACCEPT THOSE FOR INVESTIGATION BUT. MAY HELP WHAT HOW DO YOU EVALUATE WHAT YOU GOING TO DO THAT INFORMATION GIVEN THAT IT'S ANONYMOUS. SO I WOULDN'T LEAVE RECIEVER PORTS AND THAT IS ANONYMOUS AND AND WE DO KEEP A FILE. IT DOESN'T GO INTO ANYONE'S PERSONNEL FILE IT'S KEPT SEPARATE. BUT WE DO. TRY TO. SEE IF THERE'S ANY CORROBORATION TO THE COMPLAINT THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD. AND AND MAKE A DETERMINATION AFTER DOING AND THAT COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION. AND IT IT YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS WHAT THE SITUATION AS IT COULD BE REALLY GRAVEN IT COULD BE SOMETHING. ABOUT A COMMENT SOMEONE MADE THAT WAS UNWELCOME. IF NOTHING TO ADD NIGHT OKAY SO MEMBER WALDRON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. HOW SHOULDN'T SOMEONE WHO WITNESSES SEXUAL HARASSMENT? SEE IF. THE VICTIM SAYS THEY DON'T WANT GET INVOLVED THEY DON'T WANT PORTED. HE KNOWS THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE WAY TO GO OR WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN. I MEAN YOU KNOW WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO WITNESSED THINGS TO COME FORWARD AND. YOU KNOW. PICK OUT TO. HOW WOULD THAT BE HANDLED IN THE BEST WAY? WELL AGAIN FROM ADVOCACY PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING OUT WHAT THE SURVIVOR WANTS AND WHAT THE SURVIVOR NEEDS AND IS CLEARLY. I AND EXPRESS THAT THEY DID NOT WISH TO REPORT THE INCIDENT. THE FROM A TRAUMA INFORM STANDPOINT DIET. TAKING. THERE WHAT THEY HAVE ASKED FOR AND DOING OFFICE SAID WOULD READ COULD BE RE TRAUMATIZING. HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT PEOPLE TO AND ADDRESS THE SITUATION SO CAN NOT PERSON HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE PERSON WHO YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE INCIDENT AND WHAT HAPPENS. IS THERE ANOTHER WAY THAT THEY COULD PERHAPS. INSTILL SOMETHING THAT COULD CHANGE THE SITUATION WITHOUT HAVING YOU KNOW THIS PERSON TOLD ME THAT THIS HAPPENED. AND REALLY KIND OF THROWING THE SURVIVOR. UNDER THE BUS IF YOU WILL. SO I THINK DOT WHEN WHEN WE LOOK AT IT FROM AN ADVOCATE ADVOCACY PERSPECTIVE WE REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THE SURVIVOR WANTS. AND IF THAT MEANS THAT THEY DON'T WANT IT TO BE REPORTED. DOING SO MAY CAUSE I RETIREMENT HAZY XIN. DESERVE THE OPTION YOU KNOW OF SOMEONE TO SAY WELL WE WERE OUT YOU KNOW AT A RECEPTION. AND SO ON SO. WHOEVER THEN THE PERSON IS. DID THIS TO AN UNNAMED PERSON YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE IT SAY THERE ARE OTHER CLAIMS OUT THERE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT. IT CAN ACTUALLY HELP CORROBORATE. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS BEING SAID WITHOUT IDENTIFYING THE VICTIM. ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO. OBSERVE WHAT THEY'RE SEEN AND TO BE ABLE TO. SPEAK OUT AGAINST THAT. WHILE ALSO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHY SOMEONE WHO HAS SUFFERED HARM WANTS TO SEE HAPPEN. REALLY QUICK. AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO IT EVEN. PHRASE WHAT I'M TRYING TO ASK. SINCE WE'VE BEEN STARTING THESE HEARINGS I THINK IN NOVEMBER. YOU KNOW. WE STARTED HEARING ABOUT ISSUES THAT HEAD. CRUDE. YEARS AGO A YEAR AGO OR YOU KNOW. NOTHING CURRENT EVEN. AND. THE I GUESS THIS IS MORE DRESSED OUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE THE PERPETRATOR. THE KNOW WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST WHERE. NOTHING HAPPENS THEY STROVE TO WORK THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY ISSUE THE. YOU KNOW THE VICTIM. S. FILE COMPLAINTS THEIR SUFFERING ALL THESE THINGS HAPPEN PEOPLE MOVED AROUND. PEOPLE FIRED I YOU KNOW ALL THAT'S IN THE PAST. AND NOW WE'VE KIND OF MOVE FORWARD TO THIS CURRENT TIME WHERE. YOU KNOW IT'S MORE LIKE NOW PEOPLE ARE STEPPING DOWN PEOPLE ARE. PUT A LEAVE PEOPLE ARE YOUNG PAID PAID A YOU KNOW KIND OF A DIFFERENT. WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND IN BEST PRACTICES WHEN A COMPLAINT COMES AND HOW THE? THE PERPETRATOR WAS DEALT WITH ISN'T ALWAYS A CONSISTENT NO MATTER WHAT THE CLAIM OUR HOUSE THAT. DON'T WITH. I MEAN IS THERE APPEARED OF TIME WHEN THEY. NOTHING HAPPENS WHILE THINGS ARE LOOKING AT IT OR. AND ON A FROM ASKING THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE NUMBER ONE TO BE SURE THAT WE DEAL IN A WAY THAT'S EFFECTIVE WITH. THE PERPETRATOR. AND NOT KIND OF NOT SURE WHAT YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT IF THAT THE. COMPLAIN IT IS WORKING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY AND IS GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY THE BEHAVIOR US AS YOU GO THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION IS CRITICAL TO. TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE COMPLAINANT IS SAFE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME AND. DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY WORK YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE PEOPLE AROUND FOR THAT TEMPORARY PERIOD. AND THAT'S WHY WE WANTED CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND HAVE A RESPONSE READY AND INACTION. IF. THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS COMING IN ABOUT THE SAME PERPETRATOR THEN. THAT'S A TRAIL AND THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. MAY YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WE OFTEN HEAR FROM SURVIVORS INSIDE NOTHING WAS DONE THAT THERE WAS NO ACCOUNTABILITY. AND MANY SURVIVORS WILL WILL SAY THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY. WANT SOMEONE TO. MAYBE EVEN BE FIRED BE PROSECUTED ME WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THEY WANT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY THEY WANTED THAT ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THIS ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN. AND SO I THINK THAT FROM A SURVIVOR PERSPECTIVE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. YEAH AND IT JUST REMINDS ME A LITTLE OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM A FEW OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS BUILDING WHICH IS. CERTAINLY IF YOU STOCKS OF TOLD ME THAT WHEN THEY HAD FILED COMPLAINTS THE FIRST AND THEY WERE ASKED TO DO BY. OUR HR DEPARTMENT WITH HE SAID WELL IF YOU TOLD HIM HOW IT MAKE HOW IT SAYS MAKES YOU FEEL. WHICH TO ME IS JUST INCREDIBLY INSENSITIVE. AND IT WOULD NOT MAKE ANYBODY WANT TO REPORT IF THAT'S THE WORD THAT THEY SOMEHOW ARE SUPPOSE TO. OWN OR CONTROL OR RESPOND TO THEIROWN HARASSMENT AND THAT KIND OF WAY. A SENATOR MORE LEFT. IN DEALING WITH BEST PRACTICES. BEEN THINKING ABOUT. THE CHAPTER MY WIFE. MANY YEARS AGO TWO DECADES AGO WHERE I TOOK OVER. A DEPARTMENT IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT WAS THAT THEIR INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT WAS A JOKE AND SO WE DECIDED TO. PARA NEW INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT. YOU WERE TOLD AT THAT TIME I BELIEVE IT WAS TO MUNICIPAL TREASURES ASSOCIATION OF. UNITED STATES AND CANADA. THAT THEY HAD OUT A MODEL ON HOW YOU COULD PREPARE YOUR AYE INVESTING POLICY STATEMENT AND I LOOKED IT UP. I DIDN'T SEE THIS PUT TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT BUT THEY HAVE EIGHTEEN POINTS OF WHAT SHOULD BE IN YOUR. IPS. AND WE'VE BEEN. CONTACTED PEOPLE IS THAT WHAT YOU TRY TO GET CERTIFIED. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE WOULD WE NEED TO DO TO GET THE RIGHT AND NUMBER POINTS TO GET CERTIFIED SO. SO WE TRY TO BUILD. THE MODEL INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND. WE GOT THE CERTIFICATE. AFTER ALL THAT WORK AND WE GOT LIKE UBER TEASED BY ALSO GREAT NOW YOU HAVE A CERTIFIED. POLICY BUT WE GOT IT. WE GOT IT DONE SO I'M. I'M LOOKING FOR THE MODEL IN SO I'M ASSUMING THAT YOUR BOTH IN SOME KIND OF HR ASSOCIATION. THAT'S MAYBE NATIONAL. AND I HAVEN'T MIGHT DONE THE GOOGLE SEARCH YET BUT. WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT? ASSOCIATION BE AND DO THEY HAVE A SIMILAR PROCESS OF. ASSISTING. IN HELPING YOU. PROVIDE THE COMPONENTS OF WHAT UP A MODEL. SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR HR. MANUAL WOULD LOOK LIKE. I CAN ANSWER THAT I AM ACTUALLY HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS THE LARGEST. ORGANIZATION THAT'S NATIONAL THE TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND MEMBERS. AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY HAVE OFFICES HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN FACT. BUT THEY HAVE A BIG TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE THEY HAVE A HELP LINE PEER. HR MEMBERS CAN CALL. AND I GET INFORMATION ON BEST PRACTICES ON TRAINING IT'S IT'S A WORLD OF INFORMATION THAT'S. READILY ACCESSIBLE TO ANY HR PROFESSIONAL THERE'S ALSO LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS. I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME IN AND. I SACRAMENTO AS WELL. HR ASSOCIATIONS THAT CAN. WHEN CAN EASILY OBTAIN AYE GUIDELINES ON BUILDING POLICIES. SO DO THEY CERTIFY YOUR POLICIES. I'M. THE JUNE NOT THAT I KNOW OF NO NO CERTIFICATION OF POLICIES BUT THEY HIVE AND. TRY TO EMULATE NAM BLANKING ON THE NAME. SO SOME BEST PRACTICES FOR REFERENCE BUT NOT SOMETHING THAT IS CERTIFIABLE. AND WE WERE TRYING TO TRANSFER ONE SET OF SKILLS. TO ANOTHER AREA. WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO ABIDE BY THIS INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT AND IF WE WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE. WE WOULD HAVE TO REPORT THOSE VARIANCES YEAH MAYBE WE BOUGHT THE RUN. YEAH YOU KNOW RATED INVESTMENT VEHICLE WHATEVER. AND WE'VE BEEN HIRED OUTSIDE. FIRMS TO. CHECK ON OUR COMPLIANCE IS THEY'RE. A SIMILAR. CONSULTING GROUP OR SOME KIND OF. INDUSTRY GROUP THAT. REVIEWS HOW YOU'RE MANAGING TO YOUR POLICY. I BELIEVE THE IPS IS UNDER A RISA APSA UNDER DO WELL THAT MEET YOU REQUIRES THAT. ORGANIZATIONS WHO DO HIVE A RETIREMENT PLAN HIVE WHEN IN PLACE. AND THERE IS NO SUCH THING THAT I'M AWARE OF HOWEVER THERE ARE PLENTY OF CONSULTANTS WHO CAN ASSIST IN BUILDING. POLICIES AND ASSISTING WITH SUPPORTING AND NOT AND UPPER. SO. IN THAT LINE OF THINKING. YOU'VE HAD AN INCIDENT YOU RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE INVESTIGATED YOU'VE MET WITH THE PARTIES YOU COME TO A CONCLUSION. AND THEN YOU'D YOU DEAL WITH IT TERMINATION OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS. MINUTES OVER DO YOU EVER GO BACK AND ASK. THOSE PARTIES. WHAT IS THE PROCESS FAIR OR WAS IT APPROPRIATE? IS THE DICE YEAR IN A ROW YOU KNOW SO THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTIONS GOING ON BUT. BUT BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT. THAT WHAT WAS DONE WAS. MAYBE THE BEST BECAUSE THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT. WITH THE MOTION SIR. I'M JUST WONDERING ZERO A REVIEW PROCESS. WELL I'M NOT HERE REPRESENTING EACH OUR DEPARTMENT. BUT I CAN SAY THAT I AM I CALL COST SO WE HAVE PROVIDED A LOT OF CONSULTATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AROUND THERE POLICIES AND BEST PRACTICES AND WE DO HAVE SOME. LITERATURE ON RESOURCES THAT I AM HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL AROUND THAT. AND YOU KNOW I MENTIONED CONFIDENTIAL ON CLIMATE SURVEYS AS A TOOL FOR LOOKING OUT WHAT DOES THE CLIMATE. LOOK LIKE WHAT WATER PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOWARD THE FEELING ABOUT. POLICIES THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE PRACTICES THAT ARE IN PLACE SO THAT MAY BE A TOOL. THEN. FOR THE MUSEUM YOU HAVE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES ARE ANY OF THEM. BOARD MEMBERS THAT ARE. ELECTED. BY. THE CONSTITUENCY. WHERE UNDER LA COUNTY SO WE DO YOU HOT WHERE UNDER THAT? WERE UNDER THE TWO MEMBERS THAT ARE PART OF THAT. YEAH I DID SO THEY'RE APPOINTED BY YES THEY ARE PLENTY OF TEN OF THEM EXACTLY OKAY HANDSOME POINT IT. AND I'M. YOU TREAT THEM JUST LIKE THEY WERE EMPLOYEE OF THEY WERE NO WE DON'T THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE. I ORIENTATION. THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN. SO IT'S NOT UNDER MY DEPARTMENT. IT'S DONE SEPARATELY. IT'S I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WE GET TOO LITTLE TOO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES HERE. TO HAVE EXTRA EMPLOYEES IN THAT WE HAVE ELECTED'S. SO. YOU HAVE A SEPARATE POLICY THEN FOR THE I GUESS WILL CALM POINT IT'S. I CAN CHECK INTO A LOT AND DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU MANAGER IT'S AN ADVISORY CORRECT CORRECT. YEAH THEORETICALLY THE PROBABLY NOT IN THE WEEDS AND ON THE PURPOSES THAT MUCH YOU KNOW MEETINGS BUT. I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A MODEL YEAH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT REALLY REALLY APPRECIATED I THINK SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO BRING UP OUR SECOND PANEL. DOLE'S FOCUSES ON REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT NO LOGICAL ADVANCEMENT. THIS IS GOING TO CONSIST OF JEFF IRVINE FOUNDER PRESIDENT RICHARD DOT COM. BETH SCHROEDER COFOUNDER OF CANDOR. AND LEYVA FLEMING. TITLE FIVE COORDINATOR TYPES OR TITLE NINE COORDINATOR FOR UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND AS YOU. MAKE YOUR STATEMENTS FEEL FREE TO ADD ANY INTRODUCTIONS THAT YOU FEEL ARE RELEVANT. OR ANY. INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND SAID MIGHT BE AYE INFORMATIVE AS TO YOUR STATEMENTS AND THANK YOU AGAIN VERY MUCH FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY. OKAY I HAVE A MISTER IRVINE IS BEING THE FIRST ONE. AND YES IF THIS CHARGE IS KAPUT NEWBIE NAME BADGES THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TESTING. THANK YOU. AGAIN I'M JEFF FOR VINE ON THE FOUNDER BRIDGET. WE BUILD. SCHOOL SAFETY CAMPUS SAFETY AND BUSINESS PLATFORMS ALL AROUND THE. ALL AROUND CREATING SOCIAL SAFETY NETWORKS. I'MALSO HERE TODAY WITH DOCTOR GLENN LIPSON WHO IS ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES. AND WHAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH HIM. IN THE SCHOOLS. UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST I LIKE DOCTOR LIVES AND TO SPEAK FOR A MINUTE AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS WELL. EVERYBODY. MY. WHICH IS THE SPARTAN OKAY. AGAIN HELLO EVERYBODY I'M OF OF CLINICAL INFERENCE EXIT COLLEGES SO SO BY BACKGROUND I'VE BEEN TESTIFYING FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS IN THE AREAS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BACK IN THE LATE SEVENTIES RECRUITED THE FIRST POLICIES I WAS A STUDENT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT FOR THE UC SYSTEM. I TESTIFIED IN CASES THAT HAVE INVOLVED BANKS POLICE DEPARTMENTS FIRE DEPARTMENTS SCHOOLS. UP GOVERNMENT'S. ENTITIES SOAPS A SCENARIO OF THAT. I'D DEFINITELY WORK ADAM I DEALT WITH BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSES IN SOMEONE'S RIGHT TO SUE THAT CASE WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT. WAS AN EXPERT INVOLVED IN THAT. AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT I'VE WORKED I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE ASSEMBLY FOR WHAT IT IS DONE WITH ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE. WITH THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IT ADDED BULLYING IN THE WORKPLACE AND THEN THIS YEAR. UNITED GENDER IDENTITY AND GENDER DIFFUSION IS THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED. I ALSO BELIEVE. I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE CENTRAL FEATURES IN BUILDING SAFE WORKPLACES IS ALSO FOCUSING ON ETHICS FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AT YOUR E. BE. THREE FOUR BILL. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WATER APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIPS THOSE BECOME. VERY IMPORTANT. I WAS PRESENTING WITH ARE NOW ACTING DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SAN DIEGO SUMMER STEPHAN. ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIA TO SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS TO THE UP. STOP HARASSMENT ABUSE AND RAPE PREVENTION OF THE U. S. ARMY. AND THROUGH THIS WORK I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO. MEET JEFF HIRVONEN AND AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE WORLDWIDE WEB TO WHAT'S HAPPENING THE OBJECT HAITIAN OF WOMEN HOW YOU LOOK AT MINORITIES IN GROUPS. ONE OF THE THINGS IT BECAME APPARENT TO ME AS WE NEED TO HARNESS THIS. SENSE OF ISOLATION THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT WITH EACH OTHER ANYMORE THAT NOT EVEN CONVERSING ANYMORE THEY JUST TEXTING EVEN WHEN THEY'RE OUT ON. DATES IN THEIR RESTAURANTS HOW DO WE HELP PEOPLE CAN ACT. THAT WE NEED TO USE SOME OF THE SAME REMEDIES AND ACCOMPLISH THAT THROUGH A PLATFORM THAT ASSISTS PEOPLE. IN LEARNING HOW TO INTERACT REPORTING AND I WAS INTRODUCED TO JEFF THROUGH INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE IN MY ROLE I WORK WITH HR. REMEMBER CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION ARE BELONG TO SHARM. DO WITH ALL THOSE ALL THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES. AND WHAT I BASICALLY FOUND IN CONNECTING WITH JEFF IS THAT THERE WERE RESTORATIVE PRACTICES IN HERE AND THIS WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE BY THIS COMMITTEE. WE'RE LOOKING AT PREVENTION WE DON'T WANT TO COME IN AS SOON AS THEIR VICTIMS HOW DO WE HELP PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION SO WE CATCH THINGS EARLY ENOUGH WHERE THEY DON'T PROGRESS. TO WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF HARM. AND WE HAVE FOUND A GENERATION THAT IS MORE READY TO SEND SOMETHING. ARE THEY SEE SOMETHING THEY SEND SOMETHING AND WE'VE CREATED IN THIS PLATFORM INABILITY TO RECEIVE SOMETHING THAT IS SUPPORTIVE AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT THAT. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH ON. FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN ONLINE IS THE BUILDING OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS SO PEOPLE DO NOT FEEL ALONE BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CONNECT. AND WE UNDERSTAND THESE PATHWAYS WERE ABLE TO PREVENT THINGS AND ONE OF THE MAIN PATHWAYS. IS THE PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL BECAUSE MANY OF THESE EVENTS TAKE PLACE WHEN PEOPLE ARE INTOXICATED SO WE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND HAD RESPOND. AND. FOR ARM EVERYONE SO THEREFORE WARNED AND WE AVOID THESE TYPES OF EVENTS. SO. BRIDGET HAS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS LIKE MYSELF IN ORDER TO SAY WHAT ARE THE PATHWAYS HOW CAN WE DO ASSESSMENTS HOW CAN WE COLLECT DATA HOW COULD WE RESPOND IN REAL TIME WHERE PEOPLE FEEL SUPPORTED. AND WHAT INFORMATION CAN WE PROVIDE THEM THE THREE ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THESE EVENTS. MADAM CHAIR MISTER IRVING BEFORE YOU BEGIN I THINK I JUST ASK YOU WE DIDN'T HAVE YOU INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA SO BEFORE YOU LEAVE IF YOU COULD GIVE YOUR FULL NAME TO THE SERGEANTS AT PERHAPS AND THE BIO LATER. SO WE COULD BE INCLUDED THE RECORDKEEPING OF OUR AGENDA TODAY THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR OUR PROCESS. THEY ABSOLUTELY. SO BACKING UP TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE CONTEXT OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. I BEEN WORKING WITH THE GROUP OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THE AREAS OF. PSYCHOLOGY. TITLE NINE. FIRST AMENDMENT FOURTH AMENDMENT. SCHOOLS EDUCATORS PARENTS TEACHERS AND THE LIKE AND WE BUILT THESE PLATFORMS ALREADY IN LAUNCH HIS PLATFORMS IN SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. AND AS EVERYONE THING THAT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE IT'S ALL TRUE. ITS ABOUT ALL THE SEAS IT'S ABOUT TRUST IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING. BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SO AS WE BACK UP AND WE LOOK AT WHY HAS CULTURE CHANGE SO DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND IT HAS BEEN IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND IT'S BECAUSE COMMUNICATION HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. AND WITH THAT CHANGE COMMUNICATION. THE CULTURAL CHANGE CAME. WE A BRIDGET AND SAFE CAMPUS ON EVERYTHING THEY WERE DOING ITS ALL AROUND HARNESSING THAT SAME SOCIAL TECHNOLOGY THAT SAME PUSH TECHNOLOGY. THAT SAME IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK LOOP. IN ORDER TO CREATE DIGITAL PEER PRESSURE. TO CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CREATE POSITIVELY IN A RESTORED OF ENVIRONMENT. WHITE NOW WE ARE ALL OVER RUN IMMEDIATELY. BY THE IMMEDIATE POST THERE'S NO TIME TO REACT. THERE'S NO TIME TO CORRECT PUBLIC SHAMING IS NOW THE NORM. EVERYTHING THAT'S GETS POSTED THAT'S NOT TRUE AND OR HURTFUL OR HARMFUL. REGARDLESS OF PERSPECTIVE IS PUBLIC SHAMING AND IS THE MOST DIVISIVE TOOL HUMAN BEING HAS. SO WE COME AT THIS. THE PROBLEM AND ITS GLOBAL PROBLEM A IN EVERY CULTURE CUTTING ACROSS EVERY RACE. EVERY EVERY TYPE. YOU KNOW IT EVERYONE'S HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AROUND THE WORLD SO THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO. CHANGE THE CULTURE AND IT'S IT'S ABOUT LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP. BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP. TAPPING THE STUDENTS OR THE MEMBERS. OR THE LOBBYISTS OR THE BUS DRIVERS OR THE PARENTS AND EMPOWERING THEM. TO SET THE STANDARDS THAT YOU WANT IN TERMS OF CULTURE TO OPTIMIZE CULTURE VARIES IS SAY THESE WORDS VERY HARD TO DO. OUR PLATFORMS ARE BUILT ON THE RESEARCH OF DR DOROTHEA SUPPLIES. SHE IS THE LEADING RESEARCHER AND OWLING HUSSMAN SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE COUNTRY OF THE LAST TWENTY TWO YEARS TO HOUSE. OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS NOW SHE WORKS OUT OF FLORIDA. BUT HER. WHOLE. RESEARCH WAS BASED ON HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU CREATE MORE POSITIVE SCHOOL CLIMATE RIGHT. AND YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT BY ALIGNING. THE PARENT AND TEACHER IN THE CHARACTER EDUCATION OF THE STUDENT. SAME APPLIES TO ANY CAMPUS AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL OR TO ANY WORKPLACE. SO IT'S ABOUT SETTING STANDARDS AND TO VININGS TO FINDING. TO THAT END AS WE LOOK AT SEXUAL HARASSMENT WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON HERE TODAY. AND I'VE PARTNERED WITH THE WE SAID ENOUGH. GROUP OUT OF OUT OF SACRAMENTO BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN VIA HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME AND I'VE BEEN WORKING SCHOOLS ON PRIVACY. AND ISSUES ALONG THOSE AND. BUT AS WE FOCUS ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND SOCIAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT YOU HAVE TO START BUTTON FINDING IT. AND AND MAKING IT EASY TO DEFINE AND AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND. AND SO AS WE PUT TOGETHER OUR SYSTEMS WE WANTED TO DO THAT ON BOTH A VISUAL BASIS WITH ICONS. THAT A NON THREATENING AND ON TRIGGERING. AND BUT ALSO WITH DEFINITIONS THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE ACROSS ALL THE VARIOUS GROUPS THAT ARE IN THE COMMUNITY. THE OTHER THING THAT WE REALIZED AS WE LAUNCH THESE PLATFORMS IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY IS THAT. YOU WANT THE DETERRENT YOU WANT PREVENTION. COMMUNITIES HAVE ALWAYS SET STANDARDS ON A FACE TO FACE BASIS AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERPERSONAL LOOKED EACH OTHER IN THE EYE AND HAD CONVERSATIONS. UNTIL THE PHONE CAME ALONG RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK PEOPLE IN THE I MEAN JUST PRESS THE BUTTON HITS AND THEN MAYBE THEY GOT IT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T MAYBE THEY INTERPRETED CORRECTLY. OR MAYBE THE HOT. BUT IF YOU CAN TAKE THAT'S IF YOU REALIZE THAT. DIGITAL PEER PRESSURE IS NOW ACHIEVABLE RIGHT FACE TO FACE PEER PRESSURE IS ALWAYS BEEN ACHIEVABLE FOR IN THIS ROOM WERE ALL GOING TO ACT A CERTAIN WAY. BUT IF YOU CAN CREATE DIGITAL PEER PRESSURE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY. THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN THINGS START TO GET BETTER. BECAUSE YOU CHANGE THE RISK REWARD AROUND THE BAD BEHAVIOR YOU'VE CHANGED YOU BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE ANONYMOUS STARK INTO THE LIGHT. AND IN DOING THAT YOU NOW START TO HAVE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. THE OTHER THING THAT WE CAN BENEFIT FROM IN TERMS OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGY IS DATA. AYE MEAN DATA WORKS WE WILL USE IN SO MANY POSITIVE WAYS RIGHT NOW AROUND THE WORLD. WE CAN DO IT AROUND SEXUAL HARASSMENT ABUSE BOWLING HARASSMENT. AND YOU CAN DO IT BY STARTING GATHERS DATA HAD A TIME AND OFTEN. AND IF YOU CAN GATHER THAT DATA YOU CAN START TO SEE TRAIN TRENDS AND AS YOU START TO SEE TRENDS YOU CAN BECOME PROGRESS PREDICTIVE. AND THAT ALLOWS LEADERSHIP TO SET POLICY AND DIRECT LIMITED RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY. I LOOK AT THE WORLD AS EVERYTHING THE TRANSACTION I LOOK AT YOU I SMILE YOU SMILE BACK AT THE POSITIVE TRANSACTION I LOOK AT YOU YOU DON'T SMILE BACK. THAT'S A NEUTRAL OR NEGATIVE. IT'S HARD TO THE NUMBER TRANSACTIONS ON A BEHAVIORAL LEVEL THAT GO ON EVERYDAY THAT CAN BE CONSTRUED AND OR MISCONSTRUED. PHENOMENAL NUMBERS RIGHT NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GENERALLY MANAGE FROM THE TOP DOWN STRATEGY BUT IT IS SOMETHING WORK CAN BE FROM A COMMUNITY WIDE. STANDARD WHERE EVERYONE'S WATCHING EACH OTHER'S BACK. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. WORKING WITH VARIOUS ALL THE VARIOUS GROUPS FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE TO LEGISLATORS TO LEADING LEGAL MINDS ON PRIVACY AND LIABLE. TO PUT TOGETHER A PLATFORM THAT ACTUALLY COULD WORKED EVERYONE'S INTEREST. AND SO TODAY I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SHORT VIDEO. ON THE WE SAID ENOUGH. WHICH WE ARE GOING TO LAUNCH SOMETIME IN THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS. AND THAT WAS DESIGNED TO GATHER DATA. NOT POINT A FINGER TO DEBT BUT UNDERSTAND THE METRICS AND THE THE EXPANSIVENESS OF THE PROBLEM AS IT RELATES NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THE WORLD. AND WITH THAT DATA WHICH WILL SHARE WITH RESEARCHERS AND LEGISLATORS AROUND THE WORLD ON A DE IDENTIFIED BASIS. START TO SEPARATE POLICIES. AND AM NOW MORE INFORMED POLICIES. TO THAT AND SO WHY DON'T I PLAY THE VIDEO BECAUSE OF TOUGH TOO MUCH AND. THEM WHEN GOVERNMENT. MY FIRST TIME. WELCOME TO WE SAID ENOUGH ADDITIONAL PLATFORM THAT CREATES A COMMUNITY OF SURVIVORS VOLUNTEERS AND ACTIVISTS TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE SOCIAL SUPPORT TO VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BULLYING. STARTED THREE. IF I REPORT PRESS THE PLUS BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IN A PROPOSED. WHEN DID THE INCIDENT HAPPENED. BUT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL COLLEGE OR IN THE WORKPLACE HOW YOU INVOLVED I WAS THE VICTIM AYE PARTICIPATE AYE SIDE. WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AGGRESSOR WAS SOMEONE YOU KNEW? CHAIR RELATIVIST IMPROVISER I'M A BUSINESS. WE PHYSICALLY THREATENED YES OR NO. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE WOULD HAVE? SELECT VERBAL ABUSE HARASS IN THE WORKPLACE HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND LIKE DETACHING REPUTATION ON SHAMING ANY MILLION ASIAN. FROM THERE YOU CAN SELECT WHAT HAPPENS THE WORKPLACE ONLINE AT A BAR AFTER WORK ON A AIRPLANE ON THE BUSINESS. AS PARAMOUNT'S IN THE RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF THE WORKING BY. AND THEN IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT IS PHYSICAL A PURELY SOCIAL AND. WAS ANYONE WHO WITNESSED THE INCIDENT. DIDEVERYONE NOW JUST ME. FOR A FEW PEOPLE. AFTER THAT IN WRITING AND. YOU MAY WANT OF COURSE. SERVICE REMINDERS YOU AS YOU CAN TO REVEAL EVERYTHING BUT AGAIN. NOW GREATER THE TERM CONDITIONS FOR HE SAID THAT THE REPORT. IF YOU DO IT PART OF MATHIS. ACTORS AND RESOURCES TO HELP YOU. THE WE SENATE THAT HELP NOW IT'S DESIGNED TO THE USERS MEANING THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE. CORD IS DOCUMENT. I DON'T ACT THE. AND. EACH NUMBER OF THE MAP IS ASSOCIATED TOTAL NUMBER REPORT FILED IN THAT AREA. AS THE USERS IN WAS IN AND OUT THE. PHONE NUMBERS. DAHLE DATING TO. WHEN THE USER CLICKS ON A DOT. DO YOU SEE OF AN ANONYMOUS. CORD AND. WILL MISCONDUCT WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. IN THE OPERATING THE MATH THERE WOULD ALLOW THE USE. THE MAP OVER ANYTIME. FOR THE DATA. CAN YOU TO REPORT. YOU REPORTS MADE ANONYMOUSLY. FOR. AND THE ME TOO OR I SUPPORT YOU BY. CREATING A COMMUNITY OF LOVE AND FOR. BEWARE THAT. THE WORLD. SHARE X. AND WE OUTSIDE. IN ORDER TO DONATE TO THE NOT FOUNDATION. ON THE MENU ON THE LOWER LEFT HAND. AND THEN CLICK. WITH A LITTLE HARD TO SAY. IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BUT IT'S ALL ICON. DEFINITE EVERYTHING. MAKING IT EASY TO COMMUNICATE A PROBLEM ACCURATELY AT THE TIME THE PROBLEMS HAPPEN AT THE TIME THE BOUNDARY CROSSINGS HAPPENING AND RECORD IT. AND THEN LEAVE IT UP TO YOUR CHOICE AS TO WHETHER YOU CAN REPORT IT NOW AT A LATER DATE. THAT'S EMPOWER. HAVING FEEDBACK LOOPS WHEN YOU'VE BEEN HARASSED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND SOMEONE ELSE CAN IDENTIFY YOU WITH YOU AND SUPPORT YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU DON'T. YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALONE AND WE KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHEN YOU'VE BEEN HARASSED OR ABUSED OR BEATEN UP OR POLICE. IS TO IMMEDIATELY FIND SUPPORT WHETHER WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY WITHIN YOUR FAMILY OR ELSEWHERE. AND SO THESE TOOLS ARE JUST THAT THEIR TOOLS THERE TOOK COMMUNICATION TOOLS. BUT THEY'RE ALSO YOU KNOW BOUNDARY TOOLS WHICH WE HAVE ON A FACE TO FACE LEVEL BY DEFAULT. ON A DIGITAL LEVEL WE CAN NOW HAVE. Q.. SURE THEY'LL BE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU IN A MINUTE. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO MISS SCHROEDER. CUTE FACE OUT FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE OPPORTUNITY OF AND CHAIR WOMEN ARE. THAT'S FRIEDMAN AND MAKE MITCHELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RULES COMMITTEE. ON MY NAME IS SPECIAL LATER AND. I'M HERE AS A COFOUNDER OF CANDOR. AND POWER THE TECHNOLOGY PANEL BUT I AM ANYTHING BUT THE TECHNOLOGY SPECIALIST AYE YOU NEED MY CHILDREN TO HELP ME. ON JAN MY COMPUTER. SO I MY BACKGROUND IS AS A LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST I'VE BEEN OF A PARTNER IN A LAW FIRM AND I'M BEEN PRACTICING LABOR EMPLOYMENT OFF THE LAST. HIT SAY THIRTY THREE YEARS. SO THAT IS MY BACKGROUND AND I HAVE BEEN HONORED TO BE A PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN APP CALLED CANDOR. WHICH HAS LAUNCHED A LITTLE UNDER A MONTH AGO. AND. I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA FOR CANDOR BECAUSE OUT OF MY FRUSTRATION. OF BEING A LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT A. PARTNER IN ATTORNEY AND WATCHING PEOPLE NOT BRING OF. REPORTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER THINGS FORWARD. WE DID NOT DEVELOP CANDOR AS A SEXUAL HARASSMENT TAP IT'S SORT OFIRONIC THAT WE ARE THAT THIS WATERSHED MOMENT IN TIME. AND IS SITTING HERE BEFORE A GROUP OF YOU STEAMED A COLLEAGUES. LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND THAT WE'RE HERE IN WITH THIS. THIS ISSUE IN THIS INTERESTING POINT IN TIME TO MEET TO MOVEMENT. BUT WE ACTUALLY STARTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANDOR. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. IT'S MY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I ACTUALLY. WORK WITH BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING SEVERAL OCCASION. MEETING WITH MANY OF YOU THAT USUALLY MY CLIENTS AS BUSINESS OWNERS. WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING WHEN CLAIMS OF HARASSMENT. COME UP IN FLAMES AND OTHER. KIND OF THOUGHT ISSUES OF RACIAL HARASSMENT OTHER KINDS OF WRONGFUL CONDUCT ONCE THEY KNOW ABOUT THOSE ISSUES. BUT. TOO OFTEN THOSE ISSUES DON'T DON'T ARISE DON'T COME TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND THAT PEOPLE DON'T BRING THOSE CLAIMS FORWARD. IN FACT THE ACTING CHAIR OF THE EEOC I THINK RECENTLY SAID THEY BELIEVE THAT ONLY ONE IN FOUR CLAIMS OF HARASSMENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ARE MADE. AND THE REST LIMON AHMED. WHEN I TAKE DEPOSITIONS A PEEP ABOUT PEOPLE IN LAWSUITS. I AND THEY TESTIFIED THAT THEY DON'T BRING THEIR CLAIMS FORWARD BEFORE FILING LAWSUITS USUALLY IT'S BECAUSE. FOR EXAMPLE THEY. COULDN'T FIND THE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER OR THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REACH THAT ARE. THE HER YOU KNOW THE E. R. HR PEOPLE OR THEY LOST THEIR HIT THEIR HANDS HIM LOOKS AT AYE DRAFT IS VERY FRUSTRATING THAT'S BEEN LONGTIME DRAFTING THOSE HANDBOOKS THAT PEOPLE CAN'T FIND. THE POLICIES ARE GREAT I KNOW HOW THE POLICIES ARE WRITTEN THEIR GREAT COMPLAIN POLICIES I CAN TELL YOU. BUT PEOPLE LOSE THOSE POLICIES THEY GET THEM THEY READ THEM AND THEN THEY TOSS THEM ASIDE. NO ONE HAS THE POLICIES. SO. YOU KNOW I WANTED TO FIND A WAY THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T LOSE THE POLICIES PEOPLE WOULDN'T LOSE THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBERS PEOPLE WOULDN'T. SAY THEY COULDN'T GET A HOLD OF THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY WERE THERE TO HELP THEM. SO ONE DAY OUT OF FRUSTRATION AFTER LISTENING TO PEOPLE TESTIFY OVER AND OVER IN A LARGE CLASS ACTION I WAS INVOLVED IN. I WOKE UP IN MIDDLE THE NINETIES AND HOW WE CAN TO HELP THESE PEOPLE NOT LOSE. THOSE PHONE NUMBERS AND THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBERS AND THOSE HOTLINE NUMBERS I THOUGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE NEVER LOSE THESE DAYS. THEIR PHONES THERE ARE PHONES. SO THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE TO COME UP WITH NOW. AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE PRETTY MUCH THESE DAYS. TO LOSE SOMETHING. SO A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA. AND WE STARTED THE DEVELOPMENT. OF WHAT IS NOW CANDOR. AND. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS SAID TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING. THE IMPORTANCE OF OF WORKING WITH VICTIMS OF THE IMPORTANCE WAS CREATING A CULTURE OF RESPECT BECAUSE. I DO ALL THOSE THINGS. I WORK WITH MANAGERS I TRAIN. MANAGERS I TRAINED STAFF I HAVE SPENT MORE TIME IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS BY THE WAY TRAINING STAFF AND MANAGERS THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU. I COULD PROBABLY DO THIS FULL TIME. AND BODY WEIGHT BIG SUPPORTER OF AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE TWO AND ALL THE CHANGES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. ARE BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GO IN THE WORKPLACES AND WORK WITH EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS AND DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS. I SEE OUR APT IS ONLY AN ADDED. PART OF ALL OF THAT. BUT ONE THING WE DO BRING TO THE TABLE IS THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYEES TO REACH OUT AND GET A HOLD OF SOMEONE. WHEN MAYBE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THEIR LOSING SLEEP AND THEY. CAN'T FIND ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT. BECAUSE AS BEEN SAID BY MY COLLEAGUES TO THE LEFT. SOMETIMES THESE DAYS PEOPLE JUST IN THE PAST. THEY CAN'T WALK INTO A ROOM. AND. ARE APP GIVES PEOPLE THE OPTION. OF SWITCHING THE BUTTON TO THE LEFT AND MAKING ANONYMOUS IT ISN'T AUTOMATICALLY ANONYMOUS BUT THEY CAN CREATE A PROFILE. WITH THEIR NAME ON IT AND ANYTIME THEY CAN MAKE IT ANONYMOUS AND THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THEM. IN AN ANONYMOUS FASHION. NOW ARE AT. DOES NOT NECESSARILY CHARACTERIZE ANYTHING IS HARASSMENT IN FACT WE HAVE THREE OPTIONS THEY SAY. YOU CAN MAKE A SUGGESTION. YOU CAN ASK A QUESTION AND YOU COULD ASK FOR HELP. BECAUSE WE DON'T ASSUME THAT THIS IS A SEXUAL HARASSMENT REPORTING I REMEMBER I DIDN'T DEVELOP IT THAT WHAT. THIS IS JUST A COMMUNICATION TOOL. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT WE THINK THAT OPENING UP COMMUNICATION. IS WHAT MAKES EMPLOYEES FEEL MORE FULFILLED. IN FACT ALL THE MILLENNIALS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT EMPLOYEES ONE BEING GAUGE THAT'S WHAT. MAKES PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT BEING A PART THE WORKPLACE. AND IN GENERAL THAT MAKES PEOPLE. FEEL VALUED AND INCREASES. YOUR PRODUCTIVITY THE WORKPLACE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM. BUT OF COURSE. PART OF THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF COURSE YOU KNOW THESE DAYS HAS BEEN HARASSMENT AND YOU CAN CONTROL TO THAT ISSUE TO. SO. AS PART OF THIS COMMITTEE OF COURSE THAT'S WHERE ADDRESSING AND IT CAN BE USED FOR THAT TOO SO WE HAVE A SHORT. VIDEO. USUALLY DO THIS. LIVE AND I APOLOGIZE AGAIN SINCE TECHNOLOGY IS MY MY STRENGTH. I'M GOOD PRESS DEATHS. IT IS OUR LITTLE PRE RECORDED VIDEO. AND. YEAH SO THIS IS OKAY. FULL. BUT. SO THIS SHOULD BE A SCREEN THAT YOU WOULD GET PULLING THEM BACK. RIGHT SO YOU CAN YOU CAN ONLY. ON THE BACK. YEAH. WHAT I GET? SAGA PERFECT WHAT SO START. BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE HOW COME UP WHEN YOU HAVE A YOUR. PROFILE ESTABLISHED. AND YOU HAVE THE OPTIONS I HAVE AN IDEA OF THE QUESTION I'M HELPING YOU CLICK ON ANY OF THOSE. AND THEY WOULD GET FILED IT DOESN'T THERE'S A AYE DEPLOYER DASHBOARD. THAT WOULD BE ON THE EMPLOYER SIDE. SO DEPENDING ON WHICH ONE OF THESE COMES UP IT WILL GET. FILE ON HIM. SEPARATELY YOU CAN ORGANIZE IT SEPARATELY. SO EMPLOYEE WOULD PUT SHOES AT. AND THEN AT THAT POINT. LET'S SAY THE DESIGNEE HELP WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HOW WOULD WOULD REGISTERED IF IT'S A HARASSMENT COMPLAINT. SO THEY CAN SHOW THEIR NAME. AND YOUR NAME COME UP. AND AT THAT POINT THEY CAN PICK WHO THE MESSAGE GOES TO NOW WHEN THE EMPLOYER SETS IT UP FOR. YOU KNOW HOWEVER WHOEVER BY THE LATE. IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE HOW IT'S DESIGNED SO IF IT WERE FOR. LIKE THIS YOU CAN DECIDE WHO. THE MESSAGES BEGETS SEND TO AND IT WOULD BE SHOWN. BOTH THE PERSON'S NAME AND THEIR JOB TITLE BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE. FOR SOME COMPANIES YOU MAY KNOW SOMEBODY AS HUMAN RESOURCES ARE YOU MAY KNOW THEM BY THEIR NAMES SO WE WOULD WANT THEM TO KNOW. AND AN EMPLOYEE MAY FEEL COMFORTABLE LETTING EVERYBODY IN THAT GROUP THAT A COPY BUT THEY MAY SAY WAIT A MINUTE I DON'T WANT THIS PERSON A COP BECAUSE OF A PROBLEM WITH THAT PERSON. SO I'M GONNA DE SELECT. ONE OR A COUPLE OF THOSE PEOPLE. SO YOU CAN SEE DIESEL LET SOME% OF THESE PEOPLE BUT NOT ALL OF THEM BECAUSE THOSE BE THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD NORMALLY GET A COPY. THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE CAUGHT REVIEWERS WHO WOULD BE LIKE YOUR CECE'S SO FOR EXAMPLE. I LIKE TO WORK WITH RESTAURANTS SO YOU WOULD THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE YOUR G. SEES. OR YOUR HR PEOPLE BUT MAYBE I WANT MY MANAGER AT THE RESTAURANT TO GET A COPY NINE MAY NOT WHAT MY MANAGER WITH A COPY BUT IT WOULD BE MY CHOICE. YOU CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE IT ALSO WOULD SHOW YOUR LOCATION. NOW IF YOU GO TO. HI MY NAME. FOR EXAMPLE. THAT WOULD MAKE ANONYMOUS. ONCE SYNONYMOUS. I DON'T KNOW IF I GET A COPY WHO THAT PERSON IS COMES UP ANONYMOUS NOT ANY POINT IN THE ANONYMOUS CONVERSATION IF I'M THE PERSON SENDING THE MESSAGE. I CAN CHOOSE TO REVEAL MY NAME AS YOU SEE IT THERE AS ANONYMOUS NO ONE WILL SHOT KNOW YOUR IDENTITY UNLESS YOU LATER. SHOES TO REVEAL IT. BECAUSE AS A CONVERSATION IS GOING FORWARD. I MAY DECIDE I FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH THAT I WANT TO REVEAL MY IDENTITY. BUT I MAY NOT AND THAT'S COMPLETELY ON ME AS THE PERSON SENDING THE MESSAGE. SO. IF YOU SEE HERE THEN THEN SEND A MESSAGE TO AND YOU GET THE CHOICE OF WHO THE PERSON GETS SENT TO. AND THEY GOT THOSE CHOICES. SO THEY GET DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND THEY CONSIDER TO BY THE WAY. AREN'T YOU CAN ALSO. AS WELL SEE IMMINENT. THEIR OPTIONS AS THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES YOU CAN SEND IT AND I THINK WE'RE UP TO LIKE TWELVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IF YOU CAN SEND IN BUDGET CLICKING ON THE TRANSLATE BUTTON. AND HE'S A DIFFERENT LOCATIONS YOU CONSENTED TO OF THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AT THE COMPANY HAS. THEN ONCE IT'S CHOSEN YOU CAN SEND THE MESSAGE. AND THEN ISN'T THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE MESSAGE THAT IS SENT. THAT'S THE ANONYMOUS MESSAGE. THE GOOD MEDIA MESSAGE SENT AND OF COURSE THE BE A CUSTOMIZED MESSAGE THAT SENT BY THEM. OBVIOUSLY EMPLOYER. GETS PINK IMMEDIATELY. NOW I CAN SEND PHOTOS AS WELL. OR VIDEOS. IF THEY NEED TO. BECAUSE IF WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THE SOMETIMES THOSE ARE THOSE ARE. THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO ATTACH IT TO SEND. THEY MAY BE PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT MAY BE THINGS THAT THEY WANT US TO SEE. IN THE WORKPLACE. SO I CAN GET ATTACHED. AND THEN THE CITY THE INBOX AT THE EMPLOYEE WOULD HAVE THAT WOULD HAVE THEIR MESSAGES AS WELL. ORGANIZED. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A COPY OF HANDLE POLICIES SO THE EMPLOYER HAS HIM A POLICIES OR FORMS OR ANYTHING THAT THEY WANT ON THE. I MEAN OF PHONE. THAT WOULD BE A COPY SO THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SO THEIR RESOURCES ARE ALWAYS THERE AND HAD ANY ORGANIZATIONAL MAN IN THAT THE EMPLOYER WANTS THEM TO SEE THEM. AGAIN BECAUSE I GET FRUSTRATED THAT NOBODY EVER KEEP COPIES OF THEIR HANDS. THAT WE WORK SO HARD TO WRITE. SO THAT THEY ARE AS WELL. NOW. THEN. IN ADDITION TO THAT. THIS WOULD BE A COPY OF. WHAT BR SORRY WITH THE WHAT? EMPLOYER DASHBOARD WOULD LOOK LIKE. SO THE EMPLOYER DASH FOR HIS ENTIRE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH IS WHICH IS. ALL THE MESSAGES THAT ARE CAPPED AND THE CAN BE ORGANIZED AND FILED BY BY THE EMPLOYER. THEY CAN MEET TAD SO THEY CAN BE. NORMALLY WE HAVE A WHOLE DEL MURPHY THE YOU CAN MEET HAD THEM COLOR CODING SEARCHABLE. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE NOW AS WE'RE DOING VERSION TWO IS YOU CAN KEEP NOTES. AND YOU CAN SHARE THE NOTES SO YOU CAN KEEP NOTES ALONG SIDE THE WHOLE TIME IN REAL TIME CITY MAKE NOTES ALONGSIDE AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO HAVE THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS. IT ALSO SHARE NOTES AMONGST THEMSELVES THEN OF COURSE YOU CAN EXPORT ALL OF THAT IF YOU NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOUR ATTORNEY. HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THAT. SO BECOME THE ENTIRE CASE MANAGEMENT SAYS. SO AGAIN WE DON'T EXPECT THAT. COMMUNICATING BY AN APP IS GOOD EVER REPLACE HUMAN INTERACTION I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A FIRST STEP IN AN INVESTIGATION. AND THEN WE WOULD HOPE THAT PEOPLE WOULD COMMENT ON HAVE A LIVE INTERACTION. BUT THERE MAY BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE NEVER REVEAL THEMSELVES AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE. NO COMMUNICATION AND THIS OBVIOUSLY THEN YOU COULD HAVE OTHER WITNESSES AND THINGS THAT ARE PART OF AN INVESTIGATION. IT'S GONNA BE AN INTERESTING. YOU KNOW PART OF OUR OF OUR. METRICS TO LOOK AND SEE HOW WE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS THAT REMAIN ANONYMOUS HUNDREDS AND TIME THAT SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T. HOW A LOT OF AL AND LOT OF INTERACTION WITH BUT WILL LEARN AS WE GO UP? BUT ONE THING WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IS INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO GET INFORMATION AND HOPEFULLY INCREASE PEOPLE COMING FORWARD SO THAT WE DON'T LOOK AT. ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE COMING FORWARD. IN THESE RASKIN CLAIMS WILL INCREASE THIS TO MAYBE TWO WEARS THREE OUT OF FOUR PEOPLE COMING FORWARD. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. I WHAT WE WILL BE DOING DOWN THE LINE AND WELL AS BEING ABLE TO ALSO INCREASE THE ABILITY OF THIS AND USE IT FOR THINGS LIKE TAKING SURVEYS. HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AND INCREASING OUR ABILITY TO MEASURE METRICS AS WELL. ABOUT THINGS LIKE NOT JUST SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT EMPLOYEE MOODS THAT KNOW HOW EMPLOYEES FEELING ABOUT SHOWING. ISSUES IN THE WORKPLACE THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING DOWN THE ROAD WITH OUR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS BACK. AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER WAY TO ENGAGE EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE AND TAKE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EMPLOYEES. IN THE WORKPLACE AND THAT'S LIKE I SAID MY COLLEAGUES TO THE LEFT SAID THIS IS A WAY THAT EMPLOYEES ARE COMMUNICATING WITH US THESE DAYS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE THAT. FUMIGATION TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I MISS FARMING. NEAR. OR THE CLIPPERS. THAT. PERFECT. ALRIGHT ALL GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS LEAH FLEMING I AM THE TITLE NINE COORDINATOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND OF MY ROLE HERE IS TO DISCUSS WITH YOU LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR INSTITUTION WHERE JUDGE WHO INSTITUTION CATHOLIC. COLLEGE OR TITLE NINE OFFICES VERY PLEASED ABOUT THREE YEARS I'M SO LIKE MANY UNIVERSITIES AND THIS COMING AGE OF MANY MORE REPORT. I'M BEFORE THIS ME COMPLETES AROUND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT WERE PRESENTED TO THE UNIVERSITY WOULD EITHER GO THROUGH HR ARE THE STUDENT CONDUCT OFFICE. NOW MOST COLLEGE CAMPUSES YOU HAVE TITLE NINE OFFICES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED ON THE UNIVERSITY SIEU EDUCATION PREVENTION AS WELL AS TRAINING FOR THE INSTITUTION. AND ANY I AM ANYTHING ELSE THAT ARISES SO HERE THE UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO MY ROLE IS TO DO ALL OF THE ABOVE. I'M SPECIFICALLY WHY TALK TO DAY ABOUT DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS AND A LOT OF THAT ENCOMPASSES SOCIAL MEDIA AND APPS IN LETTING THEM BE AWARE. OF WHAT THOSE MAY LOOK LIKE. SO I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THE TITLE NINE IS UP TO FIFTY ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS IS PROTECT STUDENTS FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT. DATING VIOLENCE STALKING AND THE ISSUE THOSE MACHINES DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. ALL OF THESE CAMPUSES HAVE TITLE NINE OFFICES. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW A SEXUAL HARASSMENT LOOKS LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW A STOCKING LOOKS AT THE END OF THE DEFINITIONS OF THOSE THINGS SUFFER COLLEGE CAMPUS REALLY IMPRINTS YES HAVE A POLICY. THE MAKING SURE STUDENTS UNDERSTAND AND KNOW THAT POLICY LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THAT ON COSTS CAMPUSES SO BEFORE OUR STUDENTS EVEN ENTER OUR CAMPUS HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO. EITHER WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL IS THEY HAVE TO DO A COURSE OF THE CALL TALK ABOUT IT. IT IS AN ONLINE PLATFORM AND GOES OVER DRUGS ALCOHOL AND TITLE NINE BEFORE THEY EVEN COME TO OUR CAMPUS WILL ALSO BEFORE YOU CAN CHECK INTO YOUR RESIDENCE HALL ON MOVING DAY. YOU HAVE PAT HAVE COMPLETED THIS COURSE. THEN ONCE THEY GET ON CAMPUS THE FIRST PERSON THAT THEY SEE THEY GO THROUGH YOU KNOW WE IN THEIR ROOMMATES BUT BEFORE THEY GET A LITTLE SLEEP IN THEIR LOVELY BEDS THEY MEET ME. AND WE TALK ABOUT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THEY ENTER THE RESIDENCE HALLS IS WE HAVE A NEW VIDEO INITIATIVE CALLED WE GOT YOU. ANY GOES OVER ALL OF THE ISSUES ARE HAPPEN BECAUSE CAMPUS SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN THAT NIGHT THEY MAY GET INVITED TO A PARTY THAT NIGHT WE WANT THEM TO KNOW. ALL OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE SO WE DO THAT VIDEO AND THEN GUESS WHT ABOUT FIVE DAYS LATER THEY HAVE FRESHMAN ORIENTATION. AND THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A TWO HOUR ORIENTATION ON NOT JUST TITLE NINE. BUT DIVERSEY MICROGRAPHS AND BISON WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE ON THIS COLLEGE CAMPUS IF I EXPERIENCE THIS HOW DO I REPORT WHO DO I GO TO. IT'S ALL THE THINGS ARE INITIATIVE THAT WE TALK ABOUT. I'M OUR POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO ENCOMPASSES ALL OF THESE THINGS MANY TIMES WHEN YOU HEAR IN THE MEDIA SUPERCROSS SEXUAL ASSAULT. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT LOOKS LIKE NOT ABLE TO DEFINE WHAT STOCKING LOOKS LIKE SO WE GO OVER WHAT ALL OF THESE ARE. HIS ALL THESE ARE POLICY VIOLATIONS WE WANT TO CREATE CAMPUS I'M IN ENVIRONMENT WHERE STUDENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD AND BE ABLE TO REPORT THESE ISSUES THAT ARE HAPPENING. I AM SO ONE OF THE BIG PIECE OF THAT WE FOCUS ON AND WE KNOW A LOT THAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT MEDIA PLATFORMS THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT SO YOU CAN SEE ON GOOGLE. THEY HAVE THIS DATABASE FOR THEIR DISABLED A RIGHT EVERYTHING ON A GOOD A GOOGLE DATABASE SAYING THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING. ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. THEY'RE ALL TYPES OF ACTS THAT ARE GOING AROUND SO WE ENCOURAGE OUR STUDENTS TO USE WHAT WORKS FOR THEM THEIR CONSENT APPS. THREE OF THE ONES THAT WE HAVE PURSUED USER WE CONSENT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO USE THERE'S ALSO LEGAL FLING WHICH IS A NEW APP AS WELL. BUT SOME OF THE THAT'S A VERY PROBLEMATIC. WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING GOING OUT BUT I GET CONSENT FROM YOU VIA THAT OUT BUT THEN I CAN GET IN THAT ROOM AND I DEFTLY CHANGED MY MIND. I'M SO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS SO WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE USING TENDER THEY'RE USING SALSA PLEASING. MEDIA'S UPDATING SOCIAL ONLINE IS A DATING SO HEY'RE ALSO NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN GOING TO USE OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA FOR REPORTING AS WELL. SO THE ISSUE WE KNOW THIS ALREADY THAT ONE IN FIVE CALLS WOMEN ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ONE IN TWELVE COLLEGE MEN. AND ONE IN FOUR THAT IDENTIFY AS TRANSGENDER I'M NOT FOR ME OR SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON COLLEGE CAN. IN YOUR DEPARTMENTS HERE JUST THINKING OF THAT PROBABLY INDIVIDUALS WHO WORKING YOUR WORKPLACES HAPPENED SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OR HAVE BEEN IN SOME TYPE OF INCIDENTS. AND SO KNOWING THAT IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS THE TRIGGERS THAT OCCUR COMMENTS THAT ARE SAD THAT ARE HARASSMENT TO MANY PEOPLE ARE THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL THE FOR SOMEBODY WHO MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IN THEIR. TIME PRIOR IN THEIR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW THAT. I WOULD SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE TRANSITION OF OUR STUDENTS WE ALSO YOUR CHANCE YOU WILL YOU'RE GONNA GO SOMEPLACE ELSE. BUT HOW DO WE HOW ARE WE HAVING THOSE CARS USE HOW REALLY CHANGING THE CULTURE NOT JUST ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES BUT IT WORK PLACES AS WELL. SO WHY DON'T PEOPLE REPORT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN HER IS IN THE OTHER PANEL THEY DON'T THINK IT'S SERIOUS. THEY MAY HAVE A CRIMINAL PLOT PASSED MANY OF OUR STUDENTS MAYBE. DEMOCRATS SEEM TO BE COMING FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. UP WE HAVE A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO IN THERE ISN'T THERE SOME CONCERN ABOUT THAT IF I REPORT THIS. BUT IS IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE NOT JUST FOR ME. BUT FOR THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT NINETY PERCENT OF ASSAULTS ARE COMMITTED BY. PERPETRATORS ARE CONTINUOUS. SO THAT'S AN ISSUE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS. AND OVER HERE THE UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE USED CALLISTO HOW MUCH THE NEW REPORTING OUT I'M NOT EVEN JUST NAPA WEBSITE. YOU CAN USE OUR PHONE AS A MAP IS A WEBSITE. IT HAS SUPPORT SERVICES SUITS CAN CLICK ON THERE AND GET ALL SUPPORT SERVICES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT. CALLISTO AND ALL OF YOU UP THERE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT WERE PASSED OUT. IS AN INDIVIDUAL CAN GO IN THERE AND SEE DETAILS. SO I TALK TO MY SINCE I'LL GIVE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE MY STUDENTS MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN OUR MAY HAVE HEARD OF THE MUSIC ARTIST DRAKE. VERY POPULAR DECIDED MUSIC VIDEO THAT CAME OUT SO I WILL TELL MY STUDENTS IF I WAS OUT AT A CLUB AND I MET DRAKE I WOULD BE VERY EXCITED. I WANT TO TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT AYE MAYBE GOING TO JOURNAL ABOUT IT. ITS OWN CALLISTO WAS THE PRIVATE A DATABASE MANY OF OUR STUDENTS KEEP THEIR NOTES ON THEIR PHONES THEY HAVE AN ONLINE DIARY TO HAVE ETERNAL NOT THE SAFEST THING IF YOU'RE IN A STOCKING RELATIONSHIP PER YEAR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. THAT PERSON CAN EASILY GET INTO ALL OF YOUR INFORMATION CALLISTO LAOS WITH INDIVIDUAL GOING TO CREATE A PRIVATE PASSWORD. AS WELL AS A PARAPHRASE OF THE VERY HARD TO GET INTO THAT SITUATION BUT THEY CAN GO IN THE QUEUES JOURNAL. I WON I DATE IT WAS GREAT AMAZING THEY CAN TALK ABOUT WHATEVER THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT. IN OF SITUATIONS DON'T GO WELL. SO THE STOCKING SITUATION DOES OCCUR EVEN GOING CLOSE TO CONTRACT THOSE BEHAVIORS. BECAUSE WE KNOW MANY TIMES WITH SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL SOLDER SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IS TRAUMA THERE'S MEMORY WHERE THEY FORGET. SO BY TRACKING WAS IN THESE INCIDENTS GOOD BAD INDIFFERENT. IF SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK AND ASK THOSE QUESTIONS WHAT HAPPENED. ON YOUR FOR YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR THEY HAVE THIS INFORMATION THEIR. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS THERE'S A SUSAN GONNA CAN SAVE THE DETAILS AND IS JUST THERE FOR THEM THEY CAN GO IN AT ANY POINT THEY CAN GOING TO LEAVE ANY WHAT THEY CAN DO IS I GUESS AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO REPORT THIS RIGHT NOW. THEY CAN CLICK REPORT AND I GET SINCE DIRECTLY TO MY OFFICE THE TITLE NINE COORDINATOR I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS ACCESS TO THAT. THE OTHER GREAT THING ABOUT CALLISTO WHICH I THINK IS VERY INTRIGUING TO MANY IS THAT THE THAT THERE'S AN OPTION TO WAIT FOR OTHERS. WE KNOW MANY TIMES SURVIVORS OF ANY TYPE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT NEED NEVER HARASSMENT THEY DO NOT WANT A REPORT BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THIS MAY HAVE JUST HAPPENED TO ME. BUT IF THIS WAS HAPPENING TO SOMEBODY ELSE IF THIS WAS A REPEATED PATTERN. I WOULD WANT TO DO SOMETHING. IT'S O. CALLISTO ALLOWS FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHT THE FIRST LAST NAME IT WE USE FACEBOOK YOU ARE OUT BUT OTHER CAMPUSES USE EMAIL ADDRESSES AND IF IT'S A. THIRD ALSO NOW THE TACK RELEASE EMAIL ADDRESSES. THAT IF SOMEBODY ELSE WAS THE FIRST NAME THE SAME FIRST LAST NAME IN THAT PIECE BUT YOU'RE OUT. WHAT HAPPENS IN IT'S I MYSELF WAS HAD IN MY CORNER I WITH ALL OF THOSE REPORTS? THEY ALSO GET NOTIFIED THOSE THROUGH THAT THERE IS A MATCH. SO IT ALLOWS FOR THERE TO BE POWER IN NUMBERS BECAUSE WE KNOW MANY TIMES INDIVIDUALSMAY NOT WANNA SPEAK OUT BECAUSE THERE'S THIS FEAR THAT THIS IS JUST HOPPING TO ME. I LOVE THIS IS JUST THE OUTER FACE A CLOSE DON'T A LOOKS LIKE IT'S YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO THE TOP THERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT SAYS REPORTING OPTIONS SO THEY CAN CHOOSE TO REPORT HERE. THEY CAN CHOOSE TO USE OUR ONLINE DATABASE WERE COLLEGE CAMPUS SO THEY CAN CHOOSE REPORT ANONYMOUSLY THERE IF THEY WANT TO THEY CAN COMMENT ON TO OUR OFFICE THEY CAN CALL. TWO ONE THING TO REMEMBER THOUGH REPORTING IS TO HAVE ALL TYPES OF OPTIONS. CALLISTO FOR US IS JUST ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX. STUDENTS CAN USE FACULTY AND STAFF CAN USE IN MULTIPLE WAYS OF REPORTING AND WHAT IT'S REALLY JUST WHAT WORKS FOR THEM. BUT HERE'S ALSO THEY CAN SEE SUPPORT SERVICES. ON THE INSIDE INTERNAL ROUTE WHAT I LOVE ABOUT CALLISTO IS OUR THE TITLE NINE COORDINATOR WHO'S DOING ALL THE PREVENTION EDUCATION I'M ABLE TO SEE WHEN STUDENTS ARE USING CALLISTO. SO FOR US I AM ABLE TO SEE UNFORTUNATELY AFTER SPRING BREAK EVERY YEAR I HAVE A LOT OF REPORTS CAN ABLE TO SEE THAT. LAST YEAR U. S. THAT SINGLE TAMAYO. WE DON'T KNOW WHY THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE UPTAKE OF REPORTS THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER IT WOULD RECALL COLLEGE CAMPUSES CALL THE FIRST SIX WEEKS. THAT'S WHERE WE KNOW. MOVE ACROSS COLLEGE CAMPUSES THAT'S ALMOST SEXUAL ASSAULT MOST SEXUAL MISCONDUCT DOES OCCUR. SO THROUGH KHALISTAN ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING ON MY CAMPUS AND ABLE TO SEE WHAT PAGES PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE OUR OWN THEY'RE GOING TO HOW TO SUPPORT A FRIEND. MORE MOST COMMONLY USED RAGED PAGES BECAUSE WE WERE RETRAINING OUR STUDENTS NOT JUST REPORT FOR THEMSELVES WHAT HOW CAN YOU HELP YOUR ROOMMATE HOW CAN HELP YOUR TEAMMATE. I'M SEVERAL MINUTES PAGE HERE IS HOUSE YOU CAN GO IN SO THAT THE CREEK THEIR PASSWORD ANY TO CONFIRM IT. UP IF THEY'RE STUDENT. CREATING THE EMAIL ADDRESS AND THEN THEY CAN JUST ONCE SAFE CREATE THE DOCUMENT HERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT SAYS AT IT THEY CAN DOWNLOAD THE PDF. AND THEY CAN DELETE IT IF THEY DON'T WANT DON'T GO THROUGH IT ANYMORE. THAT YOUR PARTY NOW ARE WE FOR OTHERS THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS TO YOU IS ONCE THEY DO DECIDE TO SUBMIT WE GET ALL THAT INFORMATION. AND SO WE ARE MOVING FOR TO AN INVESTIGATION WE DON'T HOW TO START WITH TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. IRONY HAVE YOU DOCUMENT YOUR PDF I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. SO ABLE TO GAUGE IS NOT REACH TRIGGERING OF SURVIVORS ARE COMING FORWARD AND STARTING OVER. ALSO JUST A QUESTIONING WITHIN CALLISTO IS VERY TROM INFORMED A WE KNOW OFTEN TIMES THINGS DO NOT HAPPEN IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER SIR QUESTIONS DON'T GO IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER AS WELL. AND SO JUST ON THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND PORTAL WHERE THE CAMPUS RIGHT APPROACH. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN ORDER FOR THIS TO TO WORK. I'M SO FROM WHEN THEY FIRST ENTERED THE RESIDENCE HALLS TO WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING WITH THEIR PREVENTION EDUCATORS TO OUR ATHLETICS EVERYBODY ON OUR CAMPUS. DOES GET TRAINED. I'M FROM OUR FRESHMAN ON THE FIRST INNER TO FACULTY AND STAFF WERE MANDATORY REPORTERS TO OUR STUDENT LEADERS. THEY ARE NO THEY KNOW AND ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT OUR RESOURCES THERE KNOW OUR POLICY. THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR THEM AND SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF REFERENCES AND ACROSS CAMPUS THEIR BULLETIN BOARDS. AND SO REALLY TRANSITION TRANSLATING THAT INTO VERY THAT WAS JUST A STUDENTS KNOWN ARE AWARE OF THEIR REPORTING OPTIONS GUNNERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW. THEY'RE NOT GONNA REPORT. I'M IN CHANGING THE CULTURE IS IMPORTANT HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO. ARM BEFORE IF OFFICE LET'S DEVELOP IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE HAD ABOUT SIXTY REPORTS THAT WERE SUBMITTED ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS. WE DEFINITELY NO MORE THAN FIFTEEN INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WERE HAPPENING. THE STUDENTS DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO. THERE WAS A TRUST THAT I'M NOT GOING HR AS A STUDENT I DON'T GHOST YOU CONDUCT Y. OUT OF THE DISCIPLINARY OFFICE. SO BY CREATING AN OFFICE ON SPECIFICALLY FOR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT REPORTING HAS DEFTLY INCREASED ARE REPORTING TO OR THIS PAST THIS SO MASTER EVEN RIGHT NOW OUR RD OVER A HUNDRED REPORTS. SO WE'VE DEATHLY SENIOR TRANSITION OF OFF LOT MORE TRUST WE'RE DOING EDUCATION. ON YOU ALL KNOW APRIL COMING UP THE SUCH A SLOT AWARENESS MONTH REDOING A LOT OF EDUCATION THROUGH OUT THE YEAR. ON THAT AND INFORM STUDENTS OF WHAT OTHER OPTIONS FOR REPORTING. KNOWING THE POLICY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT POLICY LOOKS LIKE IN A LOT OF THAT DOES INVOLVE TACK. BY PROVIDING MULTIPLE WASTE GAS SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DO THINGS A PERSIBA MONEY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ON THEIR PHONE ALL DAY EVERYDAY. IT EVEN SERVER EDUCATION PREVENTION WERE DOING SNAPCHAT FILTERS WERE SAYING MESSAGES HEY WE HEARD WAS HAPPENING OVER HERE AND HE IS. WE CAN SEE THAT. WE CAN SEE THAT APPROPRIATE RIDING ON THE DASHBOARD SO LET'S WE START HAVING CONVERSATIONS IN USING SOCIALLY TO REALLY REACH PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT. THIS JUST ACROSS BUT THAT'S JUST OUR INFORMATION HERE SPECIFIC ROUTE CALLISTO BUT PICKING A COLLEGE CAMPUS APPROACH ARMS ALL THAT WE DO SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT HERE ANY QUESTIONS I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER. REALLY REALLY INTERESTING. LET ME JUST ASK SO I UNDERSTAND FROM EACH OF YOU. YOU ALL ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT HOW APPS HAVE SOME SORT OF NOTES COMPONENTS PEOPLE CAN TYPE THINGS AND. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY IF THEY TYPE IN THE NAMES OF? OF PERPETRATORS BEACH APPEARS. SO IN ARE SYSTEMS THERE CLOSE SYSTEM SO IT'S AN OPT OUT SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT OPTING IN IS REALLY HARD TO DO RIGHT NO I MEAN THEIR NAMES THE NAMES OF OF THE PERPETRATORS. IF THE PERPETRATORS NAME IS LISTED IN THERE THEN IT HAS TO BE FOLLOWED UP WITH AN A PROCESS THAT HAD HAS TO GO ON THAT GOES ON WITHIN WITHIN THE IN THE COMPANY. WITHIN THE COMPANY OR WITHIN THE SCHOOL AND IS ANY OF THAT MADE. COULD NOT BE PUBLICLY SEEN MANY OF THESE APPLICATION. AND NOW IT'S ALL CLOSED ALL THE MODERATORS WHO RECEIVE THE REPORTS ARE TRAINED AND WHAT THE LAW IS FEDERALLY ON A STATE LEVEL TITLE NINE TOTAL SEVEN. AND WHAT THE WHISTLEBLOWER LAWS ARE IN EVERY STATE BECAUSE IDENTITY THREAT IS THE BIGGEST THREAT THAT WE ALL FACE TODAY. SO UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO. AND INVESTIGATION THAT IT'S SAFE AND NON THREATENING. TO BOTH THE VICTIM AND TO THE AGGRESSORS OR OR PERPETRATORS. SO AS WE IN OUR SYSTEMS NOT ONLY DO YOU GET REPORTED WHAT WENT ON AND HE WAS INVOLVED YOU THEN DO YOU REAP USE AND. DO YOUR ACTUAL INVESTIGATION EVERYTHING'S TRACKED IN THE TIMELINE EVERYTHING YOU DID AND THEN THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY SUGGEST STORED UP PROCESS HE'S NEXT STOPS MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES. AND SO THOSE WERE BROUGH UP INVOLVE EVERYTHING FROM HELP LINES TO CONVERSATIONS THE LESSONS BOTH FOR THE VICTIMS AND FOR THE AGGRESSORS BECAUSE. THE VICTIMS OBVIOUSLY NEED SUPPORT SERVICES AND THERE'S FOLLOW UP UNDER TITLE NINE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO. AN ON THE AGGRESSOR SIDE WE BELIEVE RESTORED DISCIPLINE FOR THE MORE LAST FOR THE LESSER INFRACTIONS IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN. AND UNDERSTAND SO. OUR THAT'S OUR PROCESS WORKS. NO IT'S IN BOTH. SO WHEN THE SYSTEM WE BUILT IN AUTOMATIC EVERYTHING'S MEDITECH IN TERMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT RESOURCES SUPPORT RESOURCES STATE AND LOCAL THE COMMUNITIES CAN UPLOAD A META TAG ALL THEIR OWN INFORMATION IN REAL TIME. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES CAN ALL BE UPLOADED MEDITECH AND PUSHED BECAUSE PUSH TECHNOLOGY IS THE KEY. NO ONE WANTS TO FIND ANYTHING ANYMORE ANY TYPE OF STATIC WEBSITE OR OPT IN APPROACH WHICH IS WHAT I CALL. STATIC. DOESN'T GET MAXIMUM ENGAGEMENT IN ORDER TO CHANGE COMMUNITY CULTURAL BEHAVIOR YOU WANT TO START WITH EVERYONE. BEING IN THE SYSTEM OF SOMEONE STOPPED OUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T IN A DROP DOWN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT'S FINE BUT IF YOU START FROM A HUNDRED PERCENT AND YOU END UP AT NINETY PERCENT VERSUS STARTING AT FIVE PERCENT TRYING TO GET TEN PERCENT. THE DESIRED IMPACT ON CULTURE DIGITAL PEER PRESSURE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GOT YOUR LICENSE YOU CAN OPT IN TO GIVING YOUR EYES AND GIVING YOUR ORGANS IN THE U. S. SO WE HAVE FIVE PERCENT PARTICIPATION. OVERSEAS IN SCANDINAVIA YOU OPT OUT AND THEY GET NINETY FIVE PERCENT SO IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING IT EASY RIGHT MAKING THE CHOICES EASING. SAMPLES PATH IS ALWAYS A PATH WE WANT SO AS WE BUILT THIS WE BUILD IT IS CHOICE ARCHITECTS. WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIEST FOR. THE VECTOR THE AGGRESSOR THE BYSTANDER THE PERSON ON THE TIMELINE CORD INFESTED DRESS THAT THE POLICE TO HAVE TO GET INVOLVED OR DON'T HAVE TO GET INVOLVED THE PARENTS WHO HAVE TO FOLLOW UP. AND SO ON SO YOU HAVE TO GRAEME THEORY EVERY SCENARIO THAT'S OUT THERE. AND FIGURE OUT OKAY WHERE WE GONNA END UP HERE AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THE RISK REWARD OF STARTING THAT PROCESS AT THE BEGINNING. SO IN FORMING YOUR STUDENTS YOUR EMPLOYEES YOUR LOBBYIST. HEY HERE'S THE RISK OF HE SAID SHE SAID RIGHT. WITHOUT WITNESSES WITH WITNESSES AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS PARTICULAR EVENT TAKES PLACE AND SO HERE ARE THE THREE THINGS YOU OF THIS CHOICE. AND TITLE NINE. YOU KNOW IF IF YOU ALLEGE BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED OR RAPED OR DATE RAPED RIGHT YOU HAVE THREE CHOICES NO TIMELINE COORDINATOR YOU CAN HANDLE IT INTERNALLY. SECURITY CAN HANDLE IT ON CAMPUS OR YOU GO TO THE POLICE. ALL OF THESE HAVE TO BE GIVEN TO THE ALLEGED VICTIM AT THE TIME AND THEY THEN HAVE TO AGREE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO ONE OR THREE. OR NONE AND COMMUNICATE THAT BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY SO WE BUILD ALL THESE CHECK LOOPS INTO OUR PUSH TECHNOLOGY AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE THE RISK. OFF THE INSTITUTIONS BACK TO THE INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER IT'S SCHOOLS WHETHER IT'S CAMPUSES WHETHER IT'S CORPORATION. IT IT WITH OUR ATHLETES THE COMMUNICATIONS SOLELY BETWEEN THE EMPLOYEE AND THE EMPLOYER. SO IT'S ALWAYS CONFIDENTIAL EVERYTHING'S ENCRYPTED WE HAVE ALL THE. DAD COMPLETELY SECURE SO IT'S A COMPLETE DIRECT LINE SO. ANY NAMES ANY PHOTOS ANYTHING THAT'S THAT'S TRANSMITTED IS COMPLETELY SECURE SO IT WOULD BE JUST ONE WAY COMMUNICATION SO THERE'S NO ISSUE ABOUT ABOUT DUMB. YEAH ANYTHING BEING PREACHED. AND THE SAME ARE FOR CALLISTO IF STUDENTS CHOOSES TO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO REPORT THE CAN USE. WHEN WRITING YOU CAN CHOOSE THAT THE WAY TO RAISE YOUR VOICE YOUR HEALING WITHOUT REPORTING ABOUT ONCE YOU DOES SHE IS TO REPORT THAT INFORMATION TO OUR OFFICER WAIT FOR OTHERS ONLY RECEIVE THAT REPORT. WE DO HAVE THE PERPETRATORS NAMES WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS AYE CONTACT. I. THE SURVIVOR FIRST LET THEM KNOW THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORT TO COME OVER TO OUR OFFICE HE OVER SUPPORT OPTIONS RESOURCES WHATEVER THEY MAY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE PROCESS AND START THEIR HEALING. AND THEN WE GO OVER OPTIONS FOR THEM AS FAR AS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO NEXT. SO DID THEY JUST WANT US TO HAVE THIS REPORT TO THE US WENT SUPPORT ONLY AND RESOURCES WITH ELECTION FOR WITH A FORMAL INVESTIGATION ARE LIKE HIM FOR THE CONFLICT RESOLUTION TO THE LOWER LEVEL. SITUATION. BUT IF THE BOOK FOR OUR ESPECIALLY IN THIS TITLE NINE IF WE HAVE MULTIPLE REPORTS WITH THE SAME INDIVIDUAL. WE MAY MOVE FORWARD REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE SURVIVE MAY WANT BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION PROTECT THE COMMUNITY. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF OTHER STUDENTS. SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. FIRST OF ALL MISTER URBAN. BOB I THOUGHT PRESENTATION ON THE SYSTEM YOU ARE BUILDING IN COLLABORATION WITH WE SAID ENOUGH. THIS WEEK IN SAN DIEGO ONE AS IT WAS PRESENTED. ARM AND AS I UNDERSTOOD IT. IT WOULD BE A DATA COLLECTION TOOL BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT MADE WAS THAT WE DON'T HAVE DATA COLLECTION WE DON'T HAVE A SET. UNIVERSALLY OF THE NUMBER OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT VICTIMS ACROSS THE BOARD. AND SO. THE TOOL BEING BUILT. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD BE A TOOL THAT COULD ACTUALLY LAUNCH INVESTIGATION. CASE MANAGEMENT TOOL USED BY EMPLOYERS SO TO GET BACK TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMPS IS. QUESTION ABOUT THAT WHO OWNS THE DATA SO SO HELP CLARIFY FOR ME WHAT THE TO YOU TOOL YOUR BILL BECAUSE OUR BACKGROUND. INFORMATION IS ON BRIDGET. SO ON. TOOL YOU ARE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY SAID ENOUGH WILL BE TO DO WHAT OKAY. THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS THERE TO THE FIRST ONE IS WE BUILD A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY PRIDE. AND ON THAT PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY IT CAN EXTEND ANY COMMUNITY. I CAN CREATE A NATIVE OUT FOR THAT CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE IN SIX WEEKS TIME. BOTH ANDROID AND YOU CAN UPLOAD WHATEVER YOUR MATERIALS ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO CAPTURE. WE SELL ENOUGH CAME TO US SPECIFICALLY AND ASKED US. A WHAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT BUILDING A MAP WHERE YOU WOULD NAME PEOPLE AND ALL THAT AND WE WERE LIKE. YOU WANT TO GATHER THE DATA SO THE WHOLE IDEA BEHIND THE WE SAID ENOUGH. WHICH IS A SEPARATE APPLICATION IS TO DO JUST THAT. ANY USER. ANY FEMALE MEL TRANSGENDER WHATEVER AFFILIATION FATHER MOTHER CAN INPUT ANY BOUNDARY CROSSING OUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT THAT'D BE EITHER EXPERIENCED OR THEY SEEM. LIKE MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSING POLYTECHNIC ROUTE TIMES I COULD PUT THOSE AND. AND WE GATHER NOT WE GATHER WITH GREAT GRANULARITY THE TYPE OF SEXUAL BOUNDARY CROSSING OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT WENT ON WE ALSO GATHER THE PERIODICITY. SO WE GATHER WHAT TO DO STARRING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO BECOME MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL COLLEGE GRADUATE SCHOOL THE WORKPLACE BECAUSE THERE IS NO GOOD DATA OUT THERE. ON THESE THINGS AND SO THE IDEA WITH WE SAID ENOUGH WAS TO LAUNCH THE SAP TO THE WORLD FOR FREE. STARTING PROBABLY PRODUCT IS APRIL FIRST BECAUSE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WHERE THIS MONTH. ALTHOUGH WE COULD DO IT THIS WEEK IF WE WANTED TO. AND THE WHOLE IDEAS TO HAVE EVERYONE OUT THERE. POPULATE THEIR EXPERIENCES THAT THEY'VE EVER HAPPENED THAT THY'VE EVER HAD AS LONG AS IT'S ON TRIGGERING THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE BOTH NOW AND IN THE PAST OR FRIEND OR SOMEONE ELSE. TO REALLY MAP A LANDSCAPE OF PAIN HARM SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF THIS ISSUE AND THE DATA. ON IT WHEN I SAY PEOPLE MEN WOMEN EVERYONE BECAUSE IT'S UP TO ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS. AND SO NOW I'M CLEAR BETWEEN WE FIT ENOUGH APT THAT'S FORTHCOMING AND. BRIDGET AT THAT EXIST SO SO YOU BUILD IT. I POPULATE I GUESS I CAN'T NAME NAMES BECAUSE THIS DATA COLLECTION YOU CAN NAY NIGHTS IN THIS ONE YOU CAN TIME PERPETRATORS. RIGHT AND AND. AT IT IS THAT DATA GOAL YOU SET YOUR INTRO POLICYMAKERS THE PRESIDENT GOES INTO A LOT ACCESS. DO YOU ROLL IT OUT KIND OF TELL THE WORLD IN THIRTY THEY ROLLED OUT ON IT THE WE ROLLED OUT ON THE DE IDENTIFIED EVASIVE SO IT'S ALWAYS PROTECTED WE'RE NOT SELLING THE DATA WERE NOT RE DISTRIBUTING THE DATA. FOR ANY OTHER REASON WE HAVE RESEARCHERS WHO MAY WANT TO MIND THE DATA ON A DE IDENTIFIED BASIS BECAUSE WE FEEL AS THOUGH THAT'LL BE BENEFICIAL TO SOCIETY SIMILAR ACTUALLY WANT TO DO THAT. WILL PUBLISH THE DATA IN REAL TIME ON OUR MAPS. SO THAT THERE'S A CONSTANT AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM GOT. AS AS WE TALK ABOUT OUR OUR NEED TO. AFFECT CULTURE CHANGE AND IMPLICIT BIAS KIND OF FOCUSED THIS WOULD BE A DATA POINT THAT WE COULD HAVE A. BROADER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT UC I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THE I. T. ON THE HARVARD WEBSITE I'VE TAKEN FIFTY THIRTY. TWO MANY TIMES WE'VE WRITTEN ABOUT IT AND BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS THEIR IMPLICIT BIASES AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE THEM IT'S LEARNING HOW TO MANAGE YOUR EXPLOSIVE BIAS. AND HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND BY THE WAY. ORIENTATION AT EVERY LEVEL IS THE ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS DECIDING CLIMATE WHETHER YOU'RE GOING INTO SIX GREAT FOR THE FIRST TIME. WHETHER YOU'RE JOINING THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHETHER YOU'RE IN NEW LOBBYIST WHEN YOU GOT UP STARTING OFF AS A FRESHMAN AT SCHOOL THAT ORIENTATION PERIOD IS SUCH A CRITICAL POINT AT WHICH TO ADDRESS THIS. AND I WOULD CHALLENGE FOLKS. TO AT. THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WERE INTRODUCED IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT ANTI BELIEVED I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY WHEN MANY THOSE BILLS WERE DEBATED AND HEARD CITY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. TALK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE SHOULD JUST MAN UP IN BUILDING WASN'T THAT BIG A DEAL AND SO THE REASON I TALK ABOUT IMPLICIT BIASES BECAUSE THAT LIVED HERE AND EXPERIENCED AND HEARD IT FIRST HAND. AND SO NOW WE ALL SEEM TO BE SINGING THE SAME THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW IN A SHAME BUT FOLKS NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE ABOUT. WHAT THEY THOUGHT AND WHAT THEY VIEWED A GREAT READ IS WHISTLING VIVALDI FOR THOSE OF YOU HAVE READ IT IT'S A GREAT READ? LET ME MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ROBERT. ARE IN TERMS OF. HOW MANY COMPANIES HAVE ARE ACTUALLY USING CANDOR AND WHAT'S THE FEEDBACK YOU GET? WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE JUST LAUNCHED. INTERESTINGLY MOST OF THAT. YOU KNOW EMPLOYEE CLAIMS OF COMING SO FAR ARE NOT ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT ALL PROBABLY NOT SURPRISING. A LOT OF THEM ARE SHIITES. MANAGEMENT ISSUES DATED DAYS. THIS PERSON'S LOOKING AT ME OR TREATING ME OR I WOULD EVEN CALL THEM PULLING ISSUE JUST CONFLICT IN THE WORKPLACE ISSUES WHICH. BUT HONESTLY. I THINK. THIS PRESENTS. GREAT PRESSURE VALVE. THE FIRST CLIENT WE LAUNCHED THAT IS IT. CLIENT THAT I'VE HAD FOR YEARS AND THEY HAVE A TRADITIONAL EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER HOTLINES. AND THEY TOLD US THAT THEY NORMALLY GET A COUPLE OF PHONE CALLS A MONTH OUT OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER. AND THE AMOUNT OF OF. HICKS THEY GOT ON CANDOR WAS QUITE A BIT MORE EVEN IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS. SO THE ENGAGEMENT LEVEL WE THINK IS GOING TO BE A LOT HIGHER. BUT HONESTLY JUST SORT OF. DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEES. SORT OF THE GRUMBLING LEVEL THAT I'M FEELING AMONGST MY CLIENT EMPLOYEE BASE HAS BEEN GROWING OF THE LAST FEW. MONTHS MAYBE EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO I THINK THIS COULD BE A REALLY INTERESTING PRESSURE VALVE. YOU KNOW STEAM HEALTH YOU KNOW KIND OF THING THAT I THINK WILL HELP. EVEN IF IT'S NOT SEXUAL HARASSMENT JUST TO SORT OF LET EMPLOYEES VENT. AND WHEN I'M HEARING FROM PEOPLE USING IT. THE THE HR PEOPLE LIKE IT BECAUSE THEY'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO READ THINGS AND HAVE TIME TO GET BACK TO PEOPLE IS WHAT THEY'RE TELLING ME. SO THEY'RE FINDING IT REALLY INTERESTING LIKE I SAID WE'VE ONLY BEEN OUT FOR A FEW WEEKS BUT STILL VERY NEW. BUT SO FAR. PEOPLE ARE REALLY ENJOYING WORKING WITH IT BECAUSE IT'S ALLOWING PEOPLE TO VENT ALLOWING THE THE EMPLOYER TO GET BACK TO PEOPLE. YOU NO WILL HAVE TO SEE WHEN WE GET IN SOME OF THE HEAVY LIFTING AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S SO NEW. BUT. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BEEN AND WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING INTEREST FROM THE EMPLOYER BASED NATIONWIDE YOU KNOW I WAS SORT OF FASCINATED BY. THE THOU RETRIEVING THAT GETTING. BUT OBVIOUSLY LIKE I SAID THE NEW APP BECAUSE IT'S NEW TECHNOLOGY. BUT. SO FAR VERY INTRIGUED WITH THE RESPONSE AND AND. YOU KNOW WELL WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT GOES BUT VERY ENCOURAGING THANK YOU HOW TO SAY MISS FLEMING YOU KNOW WE'VE COME A LONG WAY WHEN I THINK ABOUT MY FIRST DAY AS A FRESHMAN NO ONE SAID. ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING YEAH. I REMEMBER WE HAD A RAPE CRISIS CENTER ON CAMPUS AND I WE DID KNOW ABOUT IT OR KNOW WHERE THEY KNOW OR EVEN KNOW WHERE IT WAS UNTIL SOME WITH RATE ON CAPITAL ME TO FIGURE OUT SO IT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR. WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS NOW AND HOW PRO PRO ACTIVE WE ARE BEING IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE STUDENTS HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES THAT'S WONDERFUL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR? WE HAVE A NURSE'S OFFICE. MY COLLEGE CAMPUS CHECK WELL YEAH YEAH CAPITAL THOSE ROOM ON THE FIFTH FLOOR BY THE MEMBERS ELEVATOR I'LL TAKE IT SHOWS THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES. THANK YOU. SOME STATISTICS WERE SHARED AND. CLEAR TO ME ANYWAY THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DATA TO BE ABLE TO TELL WITH STIFF START HERE IN THE CAPITAL. BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT ONE IN FIVE WOMEN RAPED ON KELCH COLLEGE CAMPUS WHEN TWELVE MAN ONE FOR TRANS. THOSE DON'T NECESSARILY REFLECT. OUR AND HERE IN THE CAPITAL RIGHT THIS IS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES CORRECT SHE'D ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO GATHER DATA TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. WHEN YOU SAY THAT NINETY PERCENT OF SEXUAL OFFENDERS ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS. AGAIN THAT'S DATA THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED YES THE STATE HAS BEEN COLLECTED AND THAT'S NATIONAL DATA THAT'S BEEN DONE AND SO LIKE ORGANIZATIONS TO TIGHTEN I LIKE A TEXT THAT. I'M VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE COLLECTED THE STATE AND IT'S KNOWN I'M IT'S NOT BUT IT'S NOT VISIT FOR THE CAPITAL BUT AROUND COLLEGE CAMPUSES. IN COLLEGE CAMPUS SPECIFICALLY AT U. S. ATHLETE CLIMATE SURVEYS THEY GO OUT TO OUR TO OUR CAMPUS TO. FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON OUR CAMPUS TO GATHER THIS INFORMATION BUT INFORMATION THAT WAS SHARED TO YOU ON THIS NATIONAL DATA. DO THE TEXT ORGANIZATION TO BEG THE QUESTION. IF NINETY PERCENT ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS WHAT IS HAPPENING THE FIRST TIME THEIR FANDOM THE SECOND TIME THEY HAVE FOUND. YEAH AND MANY FROM COLLEGE CAMPUSES WE KNOW STUDENTS ARE REPORTING. STUDENTS FEEL LIKE IT IS AN ISOLATED EVENT AND SO THEY ARE NOT REPORTING THAT INFORMATION BUT THEN ONCE ONE PERSON THAT'S. SUCH IN A COLLEGE CAMPUS SO WE HAVE BEEN CALLED THE RUMOR MILL. WHERE WE HAVE ONCE USES LIKE I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS IN SOMEONE ELSE'S I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT TOO WE REALIZE IT'S THE SAME PERSON SAME INDIVIDUAL? IS A THAT'S WHY THE COSTUMES LOOK WE'RE LOOKING AT CLIMATE. IS A CALLISTO ALLOWS FOR US AND WE HAVE OTHER FORMS OF REPORTING AS WELL SO WE HAVE MAXI IT WAS A DATABASE FOR STUDENTS CAN GO ON A REPORT STAFF AND FACULTY CAN GO UNREPORTED INCIDENTS. AND WE TRACK BEHAVIORS SO I GET TO INCIDENTS OF THE THING STUDENT WERE OUT REACHING TO THE INDIVIDUAL WERE SAYING. HEY REGARDLESS OF IF THAT SURVIVOR VICTOR WANTS TO COME FORWARD SAYING WE'VE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THESE BEHAVIORS. WE NEED YOU TO COME INTO OUR OFFICE WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WE MAY BE GOING TO A FORMAL INVESTIGATION BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO STOP THAT BEHAVIOR. AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T CONTINUE. ONE COMMENT TENS OF THAT QUESTION. PEOPLE SELECT VICTIMS THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT. PEOPLE HAVE LOW SELF ESTEEM THE GROOM THEM THEY MAKE THEM FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WENT ON YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GAVE ME THE MESSAGES. AND SO PART OF WHAT GOES ON WITH PREDATION IS HOW YOU SELECT SOMEONE AND YOU TO SOMEONE WHO. IS LESS LIKELY TO COME FORWARD THAT'S WHY WE SAID ENOUGH IN SOME OF THESE THINGS EMPOWER PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD. THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. WONDERFUL. IN THE BROCHURE. TITLE TITLE MY FOR UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO. IN THE MIDDLE SECTION OF SAYS SEXUAL MISCONDUCT INCLUDES A BROAD RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SOCIAL BEHAVIORS FOCUSED ON SEX. EIGHT ONE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER SPEAKERS OF THE PRESENTERS. IS THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX IT'S ABOUT POWER NAY GOES BACK TO BASICALLY GROOMING THIS PERSON TO MAKE THEM FEEL POWERLESS. NEXT TO YOU. TO THEM. TO THAT TO THEM SHIRLEY HARASS THEM. GREAT OVER OUR BROCHURE HERE'S FOCUS ON FACTS INTERGENDERTHAT HAVE LIKE INEFFECTIVE STARTING SO WE BREAK IT DOWN FOR EACH POLICY SO SEXUAL RASCO IT AWFULLY NO THAT'S MORE SO IT CAN BE BASED ON HER POWER DYNAMICS. SO MY FACULTY MEMBER ARE PROFESSOR SAYS. HEY YOU NEED TO COME OFFICE HOURS IF YOU DON'T COME TO OFFICE HOURS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PASS THIS COURSE WE KNOW THOSE POWER DIFFERENTIALS THERE BEFORE BASED ON WHO ARE FEDERAL LIKE THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES BASED OFF OF ITS ARE DISCRIMINATION BASED OFF OF SEX OR GENDER. IS ABOUT WITH THIS LANGUAGE SPECIFICALLY I'M MISTAKEN FROM BOZEMAN OF SORRY. I THINK SO. IF YOU IS IT DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A FACULTY MEMBER WHO IS SEXUALLY HARASSING OR HAS RAPED A STUDENT. VERSUS STUDENT ON STUDENT. REGARDLESS THERE ARE PROCESS. ALL PARTIES LIKE WE HAVE. THE PROCESS STARTS WITH THAT THE REPORT. I'M IF THERE IS A FACULTY MEMBER INVOLVED WITH A STUDENT. THAT WAS GONNA GO THROUGH TITLE NINE BUT ALSO EACH ARE. I'M IF IT'S STUDENTS IF IT'S ONLY STUDENTS OF ALL THE PROCESS SINCE GONNA GO THROUGH TITLE NINE AND THEN STUDENT CON. BUT THE PROCESS AS FAR AS AND SUPPORT SERVICES IN THE RESOURCES. IS ALL GOING TO BE THE SAME IT'S JUST OPINION WHICH OFFICE IS GOING TO TAKE THE LEAD. I DIDN'T COVERAGE OF JAPAN BECAUSE OF I THINK USED TO REALLY IMPORTANT FACTORS HERE. I'M ONE IS WE KNOW IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS NINETY PERCENT OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ARE SOMETIMES ABUSE BECAUSE THEY MAKE SUCH BAD REPORTERS. UP PART OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN COLLEGES WHICH IS DRIVEN ALL THIS WAS THE PROFESSOR WOULD SAY THE PERSON'S EIGHTEEN THERE ARE COLLEGE. AND SO THERE IS A SENSE OF ARE YOU ABLE TO SAY YES WHEN THERE'S THAT MUCH OF A POWER DIFFERENTIAL THAT'S WHY SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS FREQUENTLY DEFINED IN FRONT. IN TERMS OF QUID PRO QUO. IS THIS CAN AFFECT YOUR GRADE WOULD YOU GET IN RETURN. AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN IN TERMS OF THE ASSEMBLY WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOUR CAREER GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN POLITICS. UNLESS IF YOU SAY NO IF YOU PUSH SOMEONE AWAY WITH THE BE OFFENDED. AND SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT BRING IT IN TERMS OF POWER. BUT THERE'S GRATIFICATION BEING SADDAM MANY DIFFERENT LATE LEVELS THAT ARE INTERSECTING. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE FOCUSING ON. I'M ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT WORK WITH HIS COMMUNITY MATTERS THE DEALS WITH BOWLING. AND WE'RE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE REAL GENUINE CONNECTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE A CONNECTION WITH SOME OF THE HEART YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO HARM SOMEONE. THE SHOOTINGS WE JUST SAW ON PARK LAND INVOLVED A YOUNG MAN WHO DID HAVE VERY GOOD CONNECTIONS YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE SOMEONE TO AN OBJECT. IF YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE OF EMPATHY WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AND CREATING COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S APATHY THAT HOUSE BE PART OF. PART OF THIS DIALOGUE. THE REASON FOR MY QUESTIONS IS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. CO EMPLOYEES SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BETWEEN EMPLOYEES HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT FROM LEGISLATOR SUPERVISOR TOWARDS AN EMPLOYEE. BECAUSE OF THE POWER DYNAMICS AND I THINK THAT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THOSE ARE DEALT WITH DIFFERENTLY. YEAH YEAH BUT WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE SURVIVOR YOU KNOW THEIR CLIQUES THEIR FORMED PEOPLE WANNA GET ACCEPTED. THAT THERE A LOT OF RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS THAT GO ON EVEN WHEN THEIR PEERS. THAT'S WHY WE'RE REALLY FORTUNE IN THE STATE THAT WE HAVE AFFIRMATIVE CAN. WHAT I YOU KNOW WHAT POSITION ARE YOU AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT AT ARE YOU ABLE TO SAY NO? I'M ALL THOSE THINGS BECOME IMPORTANT THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE TRY TO BUILD INTO BRIDGET WHERE THEIR SUPPORT IF SOMEONE FEELS THEMSELVES STUCK IN THAT SITUATION. WHERE PEOPLE COULD TALK ABOUT WHAT HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT TYPE OF SITUATION? AND AND IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE MEN WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL. THE REALLY HAVE NOT LEARNED INTERPERSONAL SKILLS THEY KNOW HOW TO SPEAK IN ME IN FRONT OF PEOPLE BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK SOMEONE WHETHER THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THEM AND THEY HAVE. OF BOTH. HIGH. SILVA VALUE BUT LOW SELF ESTEEM UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE AND AND THEY DO THINGS LIKE EXPOSE THEMSELVES AND DO THINGS YOU SAY THEY'RE AFRAID THEY'RE GONNA GET REJECTED. THEY HAVE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE PATHWAYS WERE THE SIGNS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HOW HOW CAN WE HELP THEM CONNECTED A LEVEL WHERE THEY DON'T LOSE THE SENSE OF THE PERSON. THAT THEY ARE HARMING. BY THEIR CONDUCT AND DON'T FORGET DON'T FORGET TO THAT THAT WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT CO WORKERS THAT. EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A QUID PRO QUO SITUATION YOU HAD A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT SITUATION BECAUSE IT TOO DIFFICULT IN THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOLS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WORKPLACE WHICH IS MORE RELEVANT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE HERE. SO WHEN YOU HAVE A A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT SITUATION YOU MAY ALSO HAVE A PRESSURE NOT TO COMPLAIN BECAUSE LET'S SAY WE'RE TALKING NONTRADITIONAL MORE YOUR FEMALES NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT A MALE. BUT LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A LOT OF MALE COWORKERS WHO ARE MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT YOU KNOW BEING IN VERY BROAD OUT THERE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. AND AND TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW SEXUAL EXPERIENCES MAKING SEXUAL LANGUAGE AND YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO WANTS TO FIT IN. AND IS A LOT OF PRESSURE IN MANY CASES I MEAN AND LAW FIRMS OFTEN LIKE JUST LIKE HERE. SOMETIMES YOU MAY BE NOT AS YOU MAY NOT BE AS MANY WOMEN SO YOU DON'T WANNA SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU WANNA ROCK THE BOAT AND YOU WANT TO GET FORWARD. AND THEM MORE MEN INVOLVED SO YOU MAY JUST DO YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL COMMON SITUATION. YOU KNOW I SEE IT IN ALMOST EVERY EVERY INDUSTRY WE DEAL WITH. AND THAT'S THAT'S VERY COMMON AND HE THAT'S MORE COMMON THAN THAN ANY BY THE WAY WE STONE TO SEE MORE WOMEN SPEAK UP. WITH THIS HOMIE TO MOVEMENT AND TURN TO SEE MANY MANY MORE WOMEN MAKE COMPLAINTS BUT IT'S STILL THERE STILL PRESSURE DIGITAL FEAR AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. IF I MAY UM MADAM CHAIR. GOING BACK TO THE COMMENT. YOU ALSO TALKED THERE WAS TALK ABOUT RESTORATIVE DISCIPLINE. BUT THAT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESTORED OF DISCIPLINE. OR TALK ABOUT STUDENT ON STUDENT BUT IF IT'S FACULTY MEMBER ON STUDENT WOULDN'T THAT BE DIFFERENT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ASK INSERTED ABOUT THAT FACULTY MEMBER WHO'S USING HIS POWER OR HER POWER OVER THAT STUDENT THE STUDENTS GRADING THE STUDENTS FUTURE. AS YOU WOULD HEAR ON PETER I WOULD ASSUME. OKAY SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETIMES A SLIPPY SLOPE OF RELATIONSHIPS PEOPLE FEEL THEY. HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE AND SO. IT DEPENDS WHAT THE BEHAVIOR IS AND WHAT THE ACTION AS IF WE COULD STOP SOMETHING EARLIER. THEN THERE ISN'T SOMETHING LEGAL AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE TERMINATED OR PUT ON LEAVE. SO WERE TRYING TO HELP BRING THE SORT OF AWARENESS OF WILL PREVENTING AND WHERE WE'RE STARTING THING EARLIER IN TERMS OF WHAT IS GOING ON RYAN A RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT WHEN THERE IS THIS TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP. THAT YOU CAN'T CONSENT TO THE POWER DIFFERENTIAL. LIKE THERAPIST CAN HAVE SEX WITH PATIENTS DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE AGE OF THE PERSON AS. WE HAVE THAT IN A LOT OF OTHER PROFESSIONS WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN A LOT OF JOBS THAT IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN POSITION. SOMEONE REALLY CAN'T CONSENT AND THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO GET INVOLVED WITH THEM. SO THAT IF YOU CATCH IT EARLY ENOUGH AND SOME SAYS YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S OKAY THERE AND ADULT THE NOT IN MY CLASS NOW. THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR EDUCATION. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH PREVENTION IS HAVE PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT IN A TIMELY FASHION BEFORE SOMEONE HAS CROSS THAT BOUNDARY ALIGNED WITH IS NO GOING BACK. SEWER TALK ABOUT PREVENTION ONCE. THEY'VE CROSSED THE LINE THEN THERE HAVE TO BE CONSEQUENCE YES THERE HAS TO BE CONSEQUENCES REPEAT BEHAVIOR OF IT IF THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES IT CONTINUES AND YOU WANT THE CONSEQUENCES TO BE PROPORTIONAL. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT HAPPENS IS WE HAVE TENDED TO LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CREATES A HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT CULTURES I WAS INVOLVED. EVALUATING SOMEONE WHO USED TO WORK IN THE TEXAS LEGISLATURE IS A PAGE. THEY USE TO MAKE THE WOMEN WHO WERE PAGES WHERE LOW CUT TOPS AND TRY TO SEE WHO COULD PUT THE MOST AMOUNT OF QUARTERS IN THEIR TOPS BY THE END OF THE DAY. I MEAN THAT WAS THE SORT OF CULTURE THAT EXISTED IN THE TEXAS LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT. AND AND CULTURE AND AND WHAT'S ACCEPTABLE. MY HAS NOT SO PROUD OF THE WAY THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER AND THE VERY FIRST MEETING HAD TO DO WITH CULTURE. IN CHANGING THE CULTURE. BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE IT BEGINS. THIS CHANGE IN THE CULTURE. BUT I'D LIKE TO ALSO ADD THAT. WHEN YOU HAVE IN YOUR EXAMPLE WHERE YOU HAVE A PROFESSOR IN A AND IT'S AND A GRADUATE STUDENT OR STUDENT. OBVIOUSLY THE PROSSER'S BREAKING POLICY STEPPING OVER THE LINE IN SO MANY WAYS BECAUSE OF THE POWER IMBALANCE. THERE NEEDS TO BE PUNITIVE RESPONSE BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE RESTORED OF RESPONSE. AND THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT SOLVING THE LONG TERM PROBLEM. AND IT'S A LONG TERM PROBLEM FOR THE FACULTY MEMBER BUT YOU STILL HAVE NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE FOR THE STUDENT. BECAUSE THE PROFESSOR IT IN THIS CASE. HAS HE USED THEIR POWER SO YOU YOU WERE YOU'RE WORKING ON RESTORATIVE. DISCIPLINE FOR THE PROFESSOR BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE VICTIM. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IN THAT SITUATION THAT THE PROP THE PROFESSOR NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THE STUDENT CAN'T THRIVE OTHERWISE BUT AT THE SAME TIME. JUST REMOVING THAT PROFESSOR WHICH WE'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THEN THEY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE JUSTICE YOU SEEN IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND WITH PRIESTS AND OTHERWISE. IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE LONG TERM SOCIETAL PROBLEM SO PREVENTION IS THE BEST BUT WE HAVE TO BOTH HAVE A DISCIPLINARY AND RESTORATIVE BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT RECONNECT THAT PERSON. TO SOME COMMUNITY SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN START TO BEHAVE IN A NORMALIZED FASHION THEN YOU WILL BE FIGHTING THIS FIGHT AND YOU WILL BE PUTTING MORE. YOUNG PEOPLE AT RISK OR PEOPLE AT RISK IN GENERAL AND THIS ALSO VICTIM SERVICES THAT CAN HAPPEN TO THE LATE SEVENTIES. I MEAN IT WASN'T UNTIL VINCE IN SOME OTHER CASES THAT YOU BREAK SHOULD LAWS REPLIED SEXUAL HARASSMENT WERE YOU COULD ARGUE HAVE SOMEONE WAS DRESSED. BASICALLY WAS THE BASIS OF WHY YOU COULD OF ASSAULT SOMEONE YOU NEED TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO COME FORWARD BECAUSE IT TAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COURAGE. AND WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT IN IN THE MIX AND WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THOSE TO COME COME FORWARD AND ENCOURAGING THEM THAT'S THE PUSH BACK TECHNOLOGY THEY GET SOMETHING BACK. THAT'S BEING ABLE TO SEE THE NUMBERS THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE LATELY. LET'S LET'S NOT FORGET THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF INTERNS AND FOLLOWS. WE'RE NOT. EXACTLY LIKE BROUGH. FACULTY AND STUDENTS. AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT ARE MARRIED TO STAFFERS. I'M OWE WHO START OUT IS CO EQUAL STAFFERS AND SOMEBODY GETS ELECTED OR SOMEBODY GETS A PROMOTION. SO EVEN THOUGH IT ANTI NEPOTISM. OR CO HABITATION AYE OR WHAT IS THAT. WHICH THE TERM. YEAH. POLICIES IN WE SHOULD DISCUSS IT'S ALSO PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO THAT WHILE YOU DON'T WANT THE. YOU KNOW CREEPY LEGISLATOR ASKING OUT YEAH. COULD. NOT NOT SAY ANY NAMES BY THE WAY HAS ALSO YOU ALSO DON'T WANT PEOPLE THAT HAVE LEGITIMATE RELATIONSHIPS HAVING TO HIDE THEM FOR FEAR OF SOMEBODY LOSING THEIR ALL THE ICE. SO IT'S A LITTLE TRICKIER THAN IN THE CASE WITH FACULTY RIGHT REALLY GETTING IS A BRIGHT LINE. WE DON'T OF THE LUXURY OF THAT BRIGHT LINE WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES HERE AT GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK JUST PUT A POLICY IN THAT YOU CAN ASK SOMEBODY AT ONCE AND IF THEY SAY. NO THAT'S THAT BIT THAT YOU HAVE A ONE YEAR ONE STRIKE AND YOU'RE OUT POLICY DOES NOT REALIZE THAT SOME. HOLLYWOOD I WAS A DEVELOPMENT EXECUTIVE I WILL HAVE TO REWRITE THE PLOT OF EVERY SINGLE ROMANCE MARINO I KNOW OUR MAY I KNOW HOW THE. I HAD I HAD A CLIENT WHO SAID THAT YOU KNOW HAVE YOU NOT CHASED IS IS THE. IS THE FIFTH THEN AROUND REALLY WOULD NOT BE MARRIED TO THIS DAY I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE OLD YOU KNOW THE OLD FORTIES MOVIES AND INVEST IN THE MOVIE CABLE GUY. WHICH IS A MOVIE ABOUT STALKING HE SAYS IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE'LL GET TOGETHER MAYBE ONE IN A MILLION THAT I HAVE A CHANCE. AND THEN HE THAT HE KEEPS KEEPS MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS OF TRYING TO CREATE THAT RELATIONSHIP WE ALSO KNOW. THAT YOU FOLKS WORK VERY HARD YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO MEET SOMEONE ELSE IF YOU SIGNAL SINGLE YOU OFTEN FUND RAISING YOUR MEETING WITH CONSTITUENTS. SOCIAL PSYCH RESEARCH SAYS WE TEND TO MEET THE PEOPLE IN THE CIRCLE OF WHERE WE'RE WORKING. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WITH WITH THE VERY NATURE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE COMMITTED. SOME OF THEM ARE WALDRON. MADAM CHAIR I'M WILL QUICK TO THESE APPLICATIONS. DOCUMENT AND TRACK PROGRESS I KNOW WE CAN. I CAN SAVE DETAILS YOU CAN REPORT TO ANY OF THEM GIVE THE VICTIM ANY KIND OF UPDATE. IF THERE ARE THINGS RECEIVED YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS ON THE PROCESS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WHAT WE WE HAVE AN AUTOMATIC YOU GET AUTOMATIC REPLY THAT IT MERELY SAYS THAT IT'S BEEN RECEIVED A THAT IT'S AT THAT POINT UP TO THE THE EMPLOYEE HERE? SO THERE'S A YOU KNOW IT'S A COMMUNICATION DEVICE SO GOES BACK AND FORTH THEN THERE'S OBVIOUSLY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE. SO IT'S. THE FIRST RESPONSE IS AUTOMATIC THAT'S BEEN RECEIVED AFTER THAT IT'S GOING TO BE BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE TO THE HAVING EMPLOYEE YOU'RE. LET THE EMPLOYEE KNOW WHERE IT IT SO. IT'S GOING TO BE DEPENDENT OBVIOUSLY ON THE EMPLOYER TO LIKE THE EMPLOYEE KNOW WHAT THE FIRST. RESPONSE IS AND YOU KNOW IT. IT SOME POINT BUT AS IT'S GOING TO BE THE EDUCATION OF THE EMPLOYER TO. TO COMMUNICATE I MEAN JUST LIKE JUST LIKE REALLY ANY HOTLINE THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THUS FAR. IT'S GOING TO BE INCUMBENT ON TRAINING OF THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB. AND THAT THEY'RE DOING AN ADEQUATE JOB IN GETTING BACK TO THE EMPLOYEE. THAT THAT PART BEAT WE KIND OF CAN'T CHANGE BUTTON THAT'LL BE UP TO ME AND IN MY EMPLOYEE IN MY ATTORNEY HAT ROLE. MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WOULD. IN THE CALLISTO MAP. WORD HAS THE WAIT FOR OTHERS LIKE SAY THEY. REPORT OR PUT THEIR. AND THEY'RE WAITING. GROUP I MIGHT BE A MONTH LATER IS THERE SOME KIND OF A MESSAGE BACK OF SOMETHING THAT THEY GET THAT NOTIFIES THEM SOMEONE HAS REPORTED AND THEN THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND. REPORT OF THAT RIGHT SO IF THERE IS A MATCH THAT OCCUR SO FEW THROW EVERYTHING IN YOUR WAITING ONCE THAT ANOTHER PERSON RIGHT TO SAME INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WILL GET EMAIL. LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS A MATCH THEN YOU'LL GET EMAIL FROM MYSELF THAT HAD ACCORDING TO OUR PROCESS IS STREAMLINED I'M THE ONLY PERSON WITH ACCESS TO ANY THE REPORTS I GET SUBMITTED. YOU GET EMAIL FROM ME LETTING YOU KNOW WHICH YOU'RE AWARE THAT THERE WAS A MATCH WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUBMIT YOUR FOR YOUR FULL REPORT WOULD YOU LIKE TO FORWARD IN THE PROCESS A LITTLE CALL BY MEN. ACTUALLY DO YOU NOTIFY THERE'S A MATCH THEY CAN STILL CHOOSE AT THAT POINT IF THEY WANNA BE A PART OF A PROCESS. THE ISSUES THEY DON'T WANNA BE A PART OF THE PROCESS BUT THEN THAT'S OUR COMMUNICATION WITH OUR OFFICE START. THE OTHER THING WITH THESE APPLICATIONS. WHAT'S SECURITY YOUR PROCEDURAL DRAWBACKS ARE THAT I MEAN IT'S DIGITAL WE KNOW THERE'S ALL KINDS OF. BUT THAT SECURITY. AND THEN THE LEGAL. I MEAN IS EVERYTHING THERE. THE BILL TO BE OPENED UP TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING I AND ONE OF THE PROTECTION. UP SO IN TERMS OF SECURITY WE HAVE STANDARD MILITARY TO ON A FIFTY SIX BIT ENCRYPTION. WHEN REPORTS GO OUT THEY CAN NEITHER BE SEEN AGAIN ARE NOT SEEN OR BIOMETRICS WILL BE SEALED IN TERMS OF OUR DATA CENTERS. WERE APPROVED AT THE FOR HAVE BUCKLED GLOVES PURPOSE SUPER PATRIOT ACT COMPLIANT. OUR ARE LEGAL COUNSEL WAS THE HEAD LEGAL COUNSEL FOR BLOOMBERG MEDIAN RIGHT THE INTERNATIONAL HAVE BOOKS ON LOT PRIVACY IN LIBEL. SO WE'VE WRITTEN WHITE PAPERS ON CHILD NUDITY ON DEATH AFTER REPEATING A REPORT BEING FILED AND NOT BEING ACTED ON QUICK ENOUGH. SO WE'VE APPROACHED ALL THOSE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON. WE ALSO PROVIDE AND THIS WAS BECAUSE OUR CLIENTS ASK FOR IT. A DETAILED LIST OF EVERYONE WHO IS INVITED TO WORK ON ANY PARTICULAR REPORT EVERYTHING'S DOCUMENT AND LOCKED TIMESTAMP INSIDE OF WHAT HAPPENS. SO EVERY REPORT IS ITS OWN ENTITY AND YOU CAN ONLY BE INVITED TO IN TO SEE IF BY A MODERATOR WHO'S PROPERLY CHANGE IN THE LAW AND AS WELL AS AN RESTORED TO PRACTICE. OKAY OUR INFORMATION IS NOT PUBLIC. BELONGS THEEMPLOYER. AND SO WE HAVE ALL PRIVATE THE IN THE APPROPRIATE PRICE THE THAT I DID NOT AFTER. HER EIGHT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ATTORNEYS DID. BUT THAT DAY ON THE AYE IT TO THE INFORMATION BELONGS TO THE EMPLOYER IT'S ENCRYPTED OF COURSE BUT IT BELONGS THE EMPLOYER SO. OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN BE SUBPOENAED JUST LIKE ANY EMPLOYER CAN BE SUBPOENAED. BUT IT WOULD BE GOVERNED BY. IN OF SUBPOENA AND AND YOU KNOW DEPOSITION REQUEST JUST LIKE ANYBODY. COULD BE GOING FORWARD. AND YOU WOULD HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION. YOU WOULD HAVE THE SAME ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE YOU QUIT YOU KNOW INFORMATION OR PER PRODUCT PRIVILEGES THAT WE ALL. NO USE NOW IT'S IT'S WE DO BUT. YOU KNOW WE TOOK THOSE PROTECTIONS AS. AS AS GOOD LAWYERS DIDN'T DO NOT IN. BUILDING THIS DECIDE DOCUMENT. AND THEN I JUST HAVE TO REALLY QUICKLY CAN. CAN YOU UPLOAD VIDEOS OR AUDIO RECORDINGS AND PUT YEAH YEAH REPORTING YEAH YOU CAN FOR CLOSE TO A SO YOU CAN UPLOAD VIDEOS PICTURES ARE AUDIO RECORD. AND FALLS ASLEEP. Q.. THIS IS BUT A REALLY AMAZING PANEL IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT WHAT COULD BE DONE. THANK. AND IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST STICKING AROUND US IN CASE AFTER THE NEXT PANEL THERE'S FURTHER QUESTIONS IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE YOU DON'T. FEEL LIKE I CAN THANK YOU SO MUCH HOW WITHOUT WILL BRING UP OUR LAST PANEL. BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT WHICH IS PROVIDING VICTIM SUPPORT THROUGH REPORTING. MODEL SYSTEMS AND FOR THAT WE HAVE MARY WITH COME COUNTY COUNCIL FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND JP SHERRY GENERAL COUNSEL OF LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WELCOME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE. AND STICKING WITH US THROUGH. THE PREVIOUS TWO PANELS HOW ALLOW AND THIS WITH THEM TO BEGIN WHATEVER SHE'S READY. THANK YOU. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK OF THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE ALL OF YOU. I MY NAME IS MARY WHAT COME ON THE COUNTY COUNCIL FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND I'M HERE TO DISCUSS. THE COUNTY'S POLICY OF EQUITY WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A BEST PRACTICE MODEL. THE COUNTY WHO'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE MODEL AND HOW IT CAME INTO EXISTENCE AND I BELIEVE I HAVE HANDOUTS. TO KIND OF WALK US THROUGH SOME OF IT. SO BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS ARE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WAS UNDER A VERY DIFFICULT. FEDERAL CONSENT DECREE CASE AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT CASE. WAS THAT THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY. I WAS THE LEAD COUNTY COUNCIL ON THE CASE THE TIME. AND MYSELF IN A GROUP OF A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS OUTSIDE COUNSEL SPENT ABOUT. SIX MONTHS. DEVELOPING WHAT WE NOW REFER TO AS THE COUNTY POLICY OF EQUITY. A LOT OF THOUGHT AND DELIBERATION WENT INTO THIS MODEL. AND I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT FOR ANY MODEL. A LOT OF TIME AND CONSIDERATION MUST BE PUT FORTH IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A MODEL THAT WORKS FOR YOUR CULTURE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TODAY A LOT ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS AT ISSUE HERE. UP IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WHICH YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS WAS NOT A EASY CULTURE TO CHANGE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND. SWAT YOU KNOW EMPLOYEES. FIFTEEN THOUSAND SWORN OFFICERS UP UNDER A FEDERAL CONSENT DECREE. TO DO THIS STILL RESISTED. I AND IT TOOK A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE WE STARTED TO SEE A CHANGE IN THAT CULTURE. BUT THE CULTURE DID CHANGE. AND TODAY IT'S A CULTURE WHERE REPORTING IS THE NORM. SO THAT CULTURE BUT CHANGE WAS NOT LOST ON OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND IT WORKED SO WELL IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND BROUGHT THEM INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL CONSENT DECREE WHICH IS NO SMALL TASK. THAT OUR BOARD WANTED IT TO BE A COUNTY WIDE MODEL. SO BEGINNING IN TWENTY ELEVEN. MYSELF IN A GROUP OF PEOPLE WERE ASKED TO TURN IT INTO A COUNTY WIDE MODEL. OUT WHICH WE DID AND AGAIN WE SPENT SIX MONTHS. IN YOU KNOW WITH A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WORKING IN. AND OUT IN A WAR ROOM TYPE ATMOSPHERE DEVELOPING WHAT IT DOWN THE COUNTY POST YOU'VE EQUITY. SO GIVEN THE LATE HOUR I'M JUST TO TOUCH ON OF PUBLIC CHARACTERISTICS. OF THE COUNTY POLICY OF EQUITY WHICH WE BELIEVE MAKE IT THE BEST MODEL AND DISTINGUISH IT FROM OTHER MODELS. THE FIRST THING THE POLICY ITSELF MOST HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION POLICIES. START WITH HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION. IN THE COUNTY WHAT WE DID IS WE ADDED HADN'T AN ADDITIONAL STANDARD. AND THAT STANDARD IS INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT TOWARDS OTHERS BASIN A PROTECTED CLASS THIS IS THE POLICY THAT ADDRESSES MORE THAN SEXUAL HARASSMENT ADDRESSES ALL THE PROTECTED CLASSES. AND I WOULD SUMMIT ANY. IF YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO THE EXERCISE OF PUTTING IN PLACE A NEW MECHANISM YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST ADDRESS ALL PROTECTED CLASSES BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE BEST PRACTICE IN TODAY'S. TODAY'S WORLD. SO THIS INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT TOWARD OTHER STANDARD BASED IN A PROTECTED CLASS IT REQUIRES MUCH LESS THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED TO VIOLATE HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE THE INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE NEED NOT BE SEVERE OR PERVASIVE OR UNWELCOME OR INTENTIONAL TO VIOLATE THE COUNTIES POLICY OF EQUITY. IT CAN JUST BE INAPPROPRIATE BUT IT HAS TO BE TETHERED TO ONE OF THE PROTECTED CLASSES SO FOR EXAMPLE AN INAPPROPRIATE JOKE ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR RACE OR SEX OR RELIGION. MAY TRIGGER A POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF OUR POLICY. AND RESULT IN A COMPLAINT BEING FILED AN INVESTIGATION BEING CONDUCTED AN APPROPRIATE ACTION YOU KNOW BEING TAKEN. WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THAT AND WHAT'S WORK SO WELL IN THE COUNTY. IT'S BECAUSE THE STANDARD IS LOWER THE EMPLOYERS PUT ON NOTICE OF INAPPROPRIATE LEVEL DISCRIMINATION. YOU'RE ABLE TO INTERVENE EARLY AND CORRECT IT AND THAT RESULTS IN OFTEN FOLKS NOT LOSING THEIR JOB BUT INSTEAD MAY BE RECEIVING COUNSELING OR WRITTEN REPRIMAND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHICH IS REALLY THE CULTURE YOU WANT. YOU DON'T WANT THAT IF THE CONDUCT IS SEVERE ENOUGH OF COURSE THAT MAY RESULT IN SOME BE LOSING THEIR JOB BUT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT WERE ABLE TO GET AT THE CONDUCT MUCH SOONER. AND OUR CULTURE IS ONE THAT INSISTS THAT SUPPORTS FILING COMPLAINTS WE WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES ON AVERAGE WE RECEIVE FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND COMPLAINTS A YEAR. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M OFTEN ASKED ABOUT WHEN THEY DISCUSS OUR POLICY SOME FOLKS STILL UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS YOU HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT IT IF YOU HAVE NO COMPLAINTS YOU HAVE A LOT PROBLEMS IF YOU HAVE SIX THOUSAND COMPLAINTS YOU'VE GOT A HEALTHY WORKPLACE WHERE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE. TO COME FORWARD AND COMPLAIN AND THAT'S THE MODEL YOU WANT TO KIND OF MOVE TOWARDS. ANOTHER CRITICAL. THAT ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO ANY NEW POLICY THAT YOU ROLL OUT IS THAT YOU MUST EDUCATE BEHIND IT YOU MUST HAVE A ROBUST EDUCATION ARM WHEN YOU INTRODUCE NEW POLICY. SENATOR MITCHELL YOU WERE DISCUSSING IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THIS YEAR HAS MANDATED THAT. ALL DEPARTMENTS GO TO IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING AND THAT SORT OF. COMMITMENT TO EDUCATING THE WORKPLACE IS REQUIRED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT'S A NEW DAY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY. A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT. AND YOU HAVE TO EDUCATE AND YOU CAN'T DISMISS THAT CONCERN. I MEAN FAIR ENOUGH FOR FOLKS TO THINK YOU MEAN I CAN'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. AND THEY NEED TO BE TRAINED THAT'S RIGHT YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ANYMORE A RIGHT AND THAT TAKES SOME TIME BEFORE WE INTRODUCE THE COUNTY POLICY OF EQUITY WE SPENT THAT TIME ON THE FRONT END. EDUCATING OUR SUPERVISORS WHO DID RECEIVE OUR SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS THEY'VE RECEIVED TRAINING DIFFERENT THEN THE REST OF THE WORKFORCE IN THE LONG CALIFORNIA REQUIRES THAT. SUPERVISORS MUST HAVE A MUST BE TRAINED DIFFERENTLY IN AND WHAT THEIR ROLE IS WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AND WHAT THE LIABILITIES FOR THE EMPLOYER IF THEY FAIL TO ACT. BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA IF A SUPERVISORS INVOLVED IN THE CONDUCT ITS STRICT LIABILITY FOR THE EMPLOYER YOU DON'T HAVE A DEFENSE YOU'RE LIABLE. SO THEY HAVE TO BE EDUCATED IN THAT. ANOTHER KEY. DISTINCTION BETWEEN. ABOUT OUR POLICY IS THAT WE HAVE A CENTRALIZED INTAKE UNIT. THERE IS NO BARRIER TO FILING A COMPLAINT UNDER A POLICY OF EQUITY IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DON'T HAVE TO GO TO YOUR SUPERVISOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH OUR HR UNIT. YOU GO DIRECTLY IN YOUR ENCOURAGED TO GO DIRECTLY TO OUR INTAKE UNIT. AND THAT'S WORKED LIKE A CHARM BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE AFRAID PEOPLE ONE PEOPLE GO TO WORK TO EARN A LIVING GET A PAYCHECK GO HOMEAND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES BASICALLY. IF THEY'RE CAUGHT UP IN SOMETHING A WITNESS SOMETHING THEY MAY NOT WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN IT. YEAH THEY CERTAINLY MAY WANT TO GO TO THEIR BOSS WITH THEIR HR DEPARTMENT IF THAT MEANS REVEALING THEIR IDENTITY AND ALL OF THAT'S IN THE COUNTY WE'VE ELIMINATED THAT AS A BARRIER. GO DIRECTLY TO THE INTAKE UNIT IN THE INTAKE UNIT IN THIS IS ANOTHER CRITICAL FACT AND AND REQUIREMENT MY VIEW IS STAFFED BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. MANY OF THEM OF EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS FOLKS WITH HR BACKGROUND SO IN THE COMPLAINT COMES IN AND THE COMPLAINTS ARE ALL BUILT ON A. BUT DATABASE YOU FILE ONLINE YOU POPULATE A SCRIPT BASICALLY WE WE WALKED THE COMPLAINING PARTY THROUGH A SCRIPT SO WHAT COMES IN IS A NARRATIVE. OF WHATEVER THE INCIDENT IS THERE ALLOWED TO IDENTIFY WITNESSES AND ALL OF THAT THE INTAKE UNIT RECEIVES THAT DIGITALLY YOU CAN ALSO CAUSE YOU KNOW MAKE A PHONE CALL OR COME IN PERSON. BUT ARE OVER THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF COMPLAINTS COMING ONLINE. AND THEN OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS OUR INTAKE UNIT ASSESS THE COMPLAINT EVERY COMPLAINT THAT COMES INTO THE INTAKE UNIT GETS AN INITIAL INVESTIGATION. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT OFTEN THE COMPLAINING PARTY IS SPOKEN TO SO WE HEAR THEM WE HEAR THEIR STORY IF A WITNESS IS IDENTIFIED WE SPEAK TO THE WITNESS IF EVIDENCE IS INTRODUCED. WE LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE IN THE INTAKE UNIT THEN MAKES AN ASSESSMENT WHETHER BASED ON THAT INITIAL COMPLAINT THERE'S A POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF THE POLICY OR NOT. IF THEY DETERMINE THEIR REYES THEN IT GOES FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND THE FURTHER INVESTIGATION INVOLVES INTERVIEWING THE SUBJECT OR THE INVOLVED PERSON. THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICAL COMPONENT YOU MUST AFFORD DUE PROCESS TO BOTH SIDES OF THIS EQUATION. IT'S JUST NOT APPROPRIATE TO HEAR A BASE A DECISION ON ONE SIDE OF THE STORY YOU HAVE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY IF THERE'S SOMETHING THERE. FOR THOSE COMPLAINTS THAT WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING THERE IN THE GOES TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION THEN ULTIMATELY THAT INVESTIGATIVE REPORT IS PRESENTED TO IN THIS IS ANOTHER KEY. REQUIRED THAT ARE DISTINCTION ABOUT OUR OUR PROCESS. TO AN OUTSIDE PIANO OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO THE COUNTY HAS RETAINED NINE THAT NINE. OF WHAT WE CALL A COUNTY EQUITY OVERSIGHT PANEL MEMBERS THERE EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS THERE HR SPECIALISTS. THEY WORK PURSUANT A CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY THEY'RE NOT COUNTY EMPLOYEES AGAIN TERMINATE THEM UMP AT WILL. AND THEY WORK FOR BASICALLY IT'S ALMOST PRO BONO THEY WORK FOR A FRACTION OF THEIR NORMAL RATE. SO ANY COMPLETED INVESTIGATION GETS REVIEWED BY THIS FORUM AND EVERY WEEK IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WE HAVE. C. E. O. P. HEARINGS AND AT THOSE HEARINGS IT'S NOT ABOUT THE COMPLAINANT IN THE SUBJECT AT THAT POINT IT'S ABOUT THE INVOLVED DEPARTMENT. THE INVESTIGATION IN THE PANEL SO THE INVOLVED DEPARTMENT SHOWS UP FOR EXAMPLE THE TO COMPLAIN AGAINST THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE FIRE CHIEF. THAT CHAIN OF WILL BE THERE WE MEET IN PANELS OF THREE. EVERYONE'S EXPECTED TO REVIEW THE INVESTIGATION BEFORE THAT HEARINGS THAT THEY'RE KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE FACTS. AND WHAT'S FABULOUS ABOUT THESE HEARINGS IS THAT'S WHERE THE DIALOGUE IN THE EDUCATION HAPPENS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS EXPLAINING. TO YOU KNOW THE INVOLVED DEPARTMENT MEMBERS. WHY THIS CONDUCT VIOLATED OUR POLICY AND THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO ASK QUESTIONS TO PUSH BACK TO GET CLARIFICATION ON BOTH SIDES? BUT AT THE END OF THE PIANO THEN MAKES A RECOMMENDATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WHAT THEY THINK IF THE POLICIES AND VIOLATE WHAT THEY THINK THE APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE. AND NOT JUST GUIDED BY YOU KNOW THE SEVERITY OF THE CONDUCT INVOLVED. ULTIMATELY IT'S UP TO THE DEPARTMENT TO ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDATION OR NOT. NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME THEY DO BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT IN IN. COMING FORWARD OR SUBSTANTIATING THE RECOMMENDATION SO THAT HAS WORKED VERY WELL. ANOTHER DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS SUPERVISORS IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES MANAGEMENT SUPERVISORS THEY HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY. TO REPORT POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE POLICY OF EQUITY. SO IF I'M A SUPERVISOR A MANAGER AND I WITNESSED SOMETHING OR FROM PUT ON NOTICE OF SOMETHING. A POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF OUR POLICY AND I FAILED TO REPORT IT. I MYSELF WILL BE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE FOR FAILURE TO REPORT. AND THAT HAS WORKED LIKE A CHARM. BECAUSE. IF A SUPERVISOR SEES SOMETHING AND SWEEPS IT UNDER THE RUG AT THE EMPLOYER IS LIABLE FOR THAT CONDUCT SO WE WANTED TO MAKE OUR SUPERVISORS ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME. AND. AND IT'S WORKED VERY WELL. OTHER THINGS IN. THAT THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY BEST PRACTICE MODEL MUST HAVE AN HOUR'S HAS IS AN OPTION FOR MEDIATION. WE OFFER MEDIATION TO THE COMPLAINING PARTY OR ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO THROUGH IT IT'S VOLUNTARY. BUT IT GIVES ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY TO BE HEARD AND LISTEN TO AND HAVE THEIR CONCERNS ADDRESSED. AND. FINALLY. I GUESS WHAT I WOULD CONCLUDE WITH THERE ARE TWO POINTS. ONE IS NO MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL YOUR MODEL IS. IT WILL NEVER ELIMINATE. ALL HARASSMENT OR INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE I JUST WANT. BUT A WILL SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATED IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WE'VE CUT OUR EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION COSTS AS A RESULT OF THIS MODEL IN HALF. FROM THIRTY MILLION DOWN TO FIFTEEN MILLION OCCASIONALLY AT SPIKE'S WE HAVE A BAD CASE BUT IT DOESN'T ELIMINATED WE STILL HAVE BAD CASES SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST DON'T COME FORWARD. BUT WHEN WE PUT ON NOTICE OF IT WERE ABLE TO INTERVENE IN AND MITIGATE OUR DAMAGES AND ADDRESS THE CONDUCT. AND THEN FINALLY AS I'VE SAID BEFORE BUT I'LL SAY AGAIN TO THE I BELIEVE IT'S SO IMPORTANT HAVE BEEN HAVING IMPLEMENTED THIS MODEL INTO. A SIGNIFICANT AND. ZONES. THAT YOU MUST TAKE A MINUTE. AND HAVE A GROUP OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS COME TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOUR WORKPLACE THIS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST SLAP TOGETHER. IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE% FITS ALL A LOT OF WHAT'S BEEN DISCUSS TODAY AND THERE'S A LOT OF BEST PRACTICES THAT SHOULD BE IN ANY MODEL. BUT YOU STILL NEED TO LOOK AT YOUR WORKPLACE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD WORK BEST. IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES OUR BORDERS SUPERVISORS WHO ARE ELECTED HAVE SUBJECTED THEMSELVES TO THEIR POP TO THE MOST OF EQUITY. SO THEY HOLD THEMSELVES THEY OPERATE UNDER THE SAME POLICY IS THE REST OF US. IF COMPLAINTS COMING AGAINST THEM THEY'RE SUBJECTED TO THE SAME INVESTIGATION AN OUTCOME AS THE REST OF US AND THAT SAYS A LOT TOO BECAUSE LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP MUST SUPPORT IT. MUST SUPPORT IT IF IT'S GONNA WORK AT ALL. YOU HAVE MOVED TO A MISTER SHERRY NOW AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO BOTH OF YOU FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JP SHERRY ON THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO I ALSO COORDINATE OUR GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS. SACRAMENTO CALL ARABS ARE LESS RISK ME BECAUSE DISTRICT IS MADE UP OF THE AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGES FOR SOME THE SERVER COLLEGE FOR SOME MY COLLEGE IN SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN THOUSAND PLUS OR MINUS EMPLOYEES. I WAS ASKED TO COME TO YOU TO SHARE WITH YOU OUR PRACTICES FOR CREATING THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE PROGRAM OF EACH OF OUR COLLEGES. AYE AND YOU SHOULD HAVE NO IN FRONT OF YOU. THREE HIM DOUBTS ABOUT THIS IS ONE HAND OUT A BELIEVER STAFF MEMBER GRABBED ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE A THIRD ONE HERE. BUT THE TO. ONE PAGE HANDOUTS YOU HAVE ON PAGE FIVE AND SEVEN OF THE LARGER BOOK AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE IN A MOMENT. I WAS ASKED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY WE DID THIS AND THEN WHAT IT IS AYE WE STARTED. THIS PROGRAM WHEN MY BOARD PRESIDENT PAMELA HANDS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW HER FROM HER YEARS HERE AT THE AT THE LEGISLATURE. WAS MEETING WITH BARBARA BOXER'S OFFICE. THE STAFF MEMBER AT THAT POINT AND TIME IS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO ASKED WHETHER THE DISTRICT HAD A CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE PROGRAM. AND WHEAT WE ASKED SENATOR BOXER FOR SOME MONEY TO FUND THAT AND SHE WAS NOT WILLING TO PROVIDE THAT. BUT IT DID MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO US. THAT WE DID NEED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF A PROGRAM IN PLACE AT OUR COLLEGES AND WE STARTED THE PRACTICE OF GETTING THERE FROM HERE. OUR FIRST STEP WHEN WE RETURN TO CALIFORNIA WAS TO TAKE A VERY CAREFUL LOOK AT ARE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS TO ENSURE. OUR THAT ALL OF THE REGULATIONS BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE AS WELL AS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WERE CORPORATE IT INTO OUR POLICIES AND REGULATIONS AND MAKE MANY CHANGES TO OUR POLICIES REGULATIONS MAKE SURE THAT THOSE APPROPRIATE AND REQUIRE PROVISIONS WERE. INCLUDED FOR EXAMPLE WE NOW HAVE POLICY THAT SAYS ALL OF OUR FOLKS WILL BE A. APPROPRIATELY TRAINED IN DEALING WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND STALKING. WE HAVE A CAREFULLY CRAFTED POLICY ON CONFIDENTIALITY WHEN WE CAN MAINTAIN IT WHEN WE CANNOT. I WE ALSO HAVE A POLICY REQUIRING REQUIRING A PREVENTION AND AWARENESS PROGRAM THAT WAS BEEFED UP A LOT OF THIS REVIEW. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID OUT LIKE MY COLLEAGUES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO IS WE CONTRACTED WITH A COMPANY CALLED STUDENT SUCCESS DOT ORG. THEY PROVIDE A PROGRAM CALLED NOT ANYMORE NOT ANYMORE PROGRAM IS AN INTERACTIVE ONLINE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PREVENT SEXUAL ASSAULT. DIMMITT DATING IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STOCKINGS IT PROVIDES TRUE STUDENT. A TESTIMONIOS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO FOSTER A EMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING IN THE IN THE FOLKS WHO VIEW IT AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND. OF WHAT SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS AND HOW IT CAN BE PREVENTED AND WHAT ROLES THEY CAN HAVE IN PREVENTING IT EVEN IF THEY'RE JUST A BYSTANDER IN THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. IN ORDER TO GIVE THAT PROGRAM SOME TIEF WE'VE TASKED OUR STUDENT GOVERNMENT LEADERS ARE STUDENT. PRESIDENT IN HIS CABINET ARE STUDENT CLASS ATHLETES AND THEIR FOLKS TO BE THE ROLE MODELS FOR THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SHOWING THIS PROGRAM AS MUCH AS THEY CAN. THAT THEY'RE TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY'VE SEEN AS A GROUP AND THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR TRAINING IS STUDENTS. WE NEXT QUIRK TO CREATE A PROGRAM WHERE STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF HOW TO CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE. PRIOR TO THE ADDITION OF THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE OUR STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF HAD TWO CHOICES FOR HELP THEY COULD GO TO OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT WHERE THEY COULD GO TO ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED TITLE NINE OFFICER ANNOUNCED FOR HOW. IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO A GO TO EITHER OF THOSE THEY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE. OBVIOUSLY THOSE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN TRAINED PROVIDE A SUPPORT AND RESOURCES FOR OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF AND FACULTY THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT. BUT. THOSE FOLKS DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CONFIDENTIAL AND THAT WAS WHERE WE WENT WITH THIS PROGRAM. WE STARTED OUT WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD APPOINT ONE OR TWO OR THREE PEOPLE EACH OF THE COLLEGES TO BE THIS CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE. WE QUICKLY LEARNED THAT THE LAW WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DO NOT HAVE SEXUAL ASSAULT CRISIS COUNSELORS WHO ARE EMPLOYED FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND WITHOUT THAT UNDERPINNING THE PERSON TO WHOM A STUDENT OR FACULTY MEMBER OR STAFF MEMBER WENT TO. WOULD NOT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO REFUSE TO TALK TO ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE REPORT. GIVEN THAT IF A PERSON WHO COMMITTED AN ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST ONE OF OUR FOLKS. ACTUALLY DID IT AGAIN AND WE KNEW ABOUT IT AND WE HAD SOME OF THAT A PRIVILEGE TO REPORTED THE COLLEGES ACTUALLY COULD BE LIABLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THAT PERSON. AS A RESULT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO FIND THAT PERSON AND WE WENT OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND WE FOUND WE'VE WE'VE AS SACRAMENTO COUNTY'S. PRIMARY OUR PROVIDER OF CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. THEY HIRE SEXUAL ASSAULT HOW PREVENTION COUNSELORS AND WE CONTRACTED WITH WE'VE TO PUT SOMEONE ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES TWENTY HOURS A WEEK. OF FIVE HOURS A DAY ARE YOU EACH OF THE COLLEGES. WE PUT A WEAVE EMAIL IN PLACE WHICH IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE TO THAT PERSON THAT'S WE'VE GOT LOS RIOS DOT EDU. HOW WE GIVE THEM THEIR OWN PHONE NUMBER IT'S NINE ONE SIX FIVE SIX EIGHT THREE ZERO ONE ONE ONCE AGAIN THAT IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE WE'VE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE ON OUR PROGRAM? THE WE'VE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATES JOB LOS RIOS TO PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CONFIDENTIAL ADVICE. THEY WILL NOT TELL ANYBODY WHAT IS TOLD TO THEM UNLESS THE PERSON WHO TELLS THEM THAT WANTS THEM TO. THEY WILL TELL THEM ABOUT OUR POLICE SERVICES THERE WILL TELL THEM ABOUT OUR TITLE NINE OFFICER THEY WILL TELL THEM WATER COLLEGES WILL DO IN TERMS OF HELPING THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND DESCRIBE THE PROCESSES OF BOTH THE CRIMINAL PROCESS AND THE CIVIL PROCESS THAT RELATES TO THAT CRIME THAT'S BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST THEM. BECAUSE THEY ARE SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR THEY HAVE THAT PRIVILEGE REFUSE TO REVEAL ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THEM BY THE SURVIVOR. AND. PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL OF THAT. IS THAT THIS PERSON'S REAL JOB IS TO SIT WITH THE PERSON. WHETHER IT'S AT A HOSPITAL. WHETHER IT'S AT A HEARING. WHETHER IT'S WHEN THEY'RE GO TALK TO THE POLICE WHETHER IT'S PART OF OUR DISCIPLINE OUR PROCESSES VERY THERE TO SUPPORT THE PERSON WHO'S COME TO THEM FOR HELP AND THAT'S WHAT. IS MOST IMPORTANT TO ME ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. OBVIOUSLY ARE WE FOLKS UNDERSTAND WHERE COLLEGE PROPHECIES ARE AND WHERE POLICE PROCESSES ARE IN MAY WILL PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO SOMEONE WHO COMES TO THEM SO WE'RE GETTING THAT INFORMATION TO THEM CONFIDENTIALLY. AND THEY GET TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO DO ONCE THAT INFORMATION'S BEEN REPORTED. THE ONLY INFORMATION THE COLLEGES GET IS VERY DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION AS YOU FOR BEFORE WE S. COLLEGES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. SO WE HEAR ABOUT OR KNOW ABOUT SITUATIONS WHERE VIOLENCE IS BEING PORTRAYED HER SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS BEING. PERPETRATED ON OUR STUDENTS BY CLEAR STAFF NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S HAPPENING HOW IT'S HAPPENING WHAT. WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING SO THAT WE CAN TAKE PROACTIVE MEASURES TO STOP IT AND SO WE GET? THAT VERY GENERIC SOMEONE WAS HURT IN THIS PARTICULAR PLACE AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME. POSSIBLY. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VICTIM IF IT'S APPROPRIATE AND. YEAH I ANONYMOUS ENOUGH SO THAT IT WILL NOT GIVE AWAY THE VICTIMS IN IDENTITY TO US IF THAT'S WHAT THEY PREFER. SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THIS TO MAKE SURE TITLE NINE OFFICERS HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR FOLKS. IF OUR WE'VE PERSON IS AT AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE IN THE PERSON WHO NEEDS THEM AS A CRC THEY WILL TRAVEL. IF THE PERSON NEEDS THEM AFTER HOURS OF THAT NUMBER IS A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NUMBER THAT EMAILS A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NUMBER AND WE'VE OBVIOUSLY HAS IT'S OWN TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NUMBER THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR STUDENTS. ONCE THIS PROGRAM WAS UP AND RUNNING ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID IS WE MADE SURE THAT EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT WERE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE EITHER UNDER LAW. OR IT'S GOOD INFORMATION. TO ARE A PERSON WHO SUFFER FROM SEXUAL VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE OR STALKING WHO WAS IN ONE PLACE PENCIL WE CAME UP WITH THIS BOOKLET. IT'S THIRTYFIVE PAGES FRANKLY IT'S TOO LONG AND IT HOW IT IS AS COMPREHENSIVE AS COMPREHENSIVE COMES BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP ONE O THESE DAYS TAKE A READ ON SOME OF THESE PIECES. BUT WE THOUGHT WHAT WAS REALLY MORE IMPORTANT WAS TO GIVE PEOPLE. MANAGEABLE INFORMATION AND SO WE WENT TOGETHER WE CREATED THIS INFOGRAPHIC WHICH IS YOUR CHOICES FOR HELP BASICALLY SETS FORTH THE THREE CHOICES OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF HOUSE. HAS THE COMMUNICATION INFORMATION THEIR EMAIL OR THEIR PHONE NUMBERS. FOR TITLE NINE OFFICE I'M SORRY ARE FOR A TITLE NINE OFFICERS THERE'S A YEAR OR YOU ARE EL SO THAT THEY CAN GET BECAUSE THOSE FOLKS CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME SO THEY CAN GET ALL THAT INFORMATION. ON THE BACK THERE'S PHONE NUMBERS TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS ALL THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AS MUCH AS WE CAN PART. SO THAT WAS AN EASY DOCUMENT WE WILL SHIP THIS TO ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY WHO WANTS IT WE POSTED AS FAR AND WIDE AS WE CAN ON THE COLLEGES. AND DAD THIS IS OUR SECOND VERSION OF IT I HAVE TO BUY GIVE KUDOS TO MY PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE BECAUSE HE TOOK THE FIRST VERSION AND JUST MADE IT WAY BETTER AND WAY MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS. THE SECOND PIECE OF INFORMATION WE CAME UP WITH WAS YOUR YOUR. KEACH KEY POINTS AT A GLANCE DOCUMENT THIS DOCUMENT PROVIDES IN SHORT SIMPLE PLAIN LANGUAGE TO SOMEONE WHO'S JUST SUFFERED FROM SERIOUS ARE. A TRAUMA WHAT DO I DO AFTER THIS HAPPENED WHO ARE REPORTED TO WHAT IS CONFIDENTIALITY MEAN ONE OF THE LEGAL RIGHTS AND WHAT WILL THE COLLEGE STUDENTS WE TRY TO DO THAT IS SHORT AND SIMPLE AND PLAIN AS WE COULD IN A SINGLE DOCUMENT. WE'RE PRETTY PROUD OF THOSE DOCUMENTS IT TOOK A LOT OF WORK FROM OUR. POLICE DEPARTMENT OR TITLE NINE FOLKS OUR STUDENTS SERVICES FOLKS I ENTER PUBLIC RELATIONS FOLKS ON AND AS I MENTIONED ALL THREE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOU. WITH THAT. I WOULD ALSO INDICATE THAT THAT THIS IS OUR. SECOND YEAR OF HAVING A WE'VE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE PROGRAM IN PLACE. I DURING THE FIRST YEAR WE HAD REPORTS OF TWO ON CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULTS THAT PASSED FOR SERVICES FROM THIS PARTICULAR PERSON. AND WE ALSO RECEIVED INFORMATION ABOUT EIGHTEEN OFF CAMPUS ASSAULTS FOR WHICH WERE THE WE FOLKS WERE WERE BEING HELPFUL TO THE VICTIMS OF THOSE. SITUATIONS. I SHOULD SAY SURVIVORS EXCUSE ME. THE WE'VE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATES OTHER ROLE IN OUR COLLEGES IS ALSO TO HELP US WITH SEXUAL AWARENESS AND SEXUAL AWARENESS PREVENTION. OUR AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION. THEY ASSISTED WITH FORTY TWO PREVENTION EDUCATION TRAININGS PRESENTATION PRESENTATIONS AN OUTREACH EVENTS AND ATTENDED A TON OF MEETINGS IN EACH OF OUR COLLEGES HOPING OUR FOLKS TO PUT OUR SEXUAL SO PROGRAM INTO PLACE AND WE HAVE A. A SECOND BUT DIED LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO THIS ONE WHICH IS OUR SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION. A PROGRAM IN WHICH ARE EACH OF THE COLLEGES ARE UNDERTAKING ACTIVITIES ON A DAILY ON A YEARLY BASIS. ADDRESSING SEXUAL PERSON. ASSAULT PREVENTION SO WITH THAT I'LL ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH RUNNING SPEAK THANK YOU DESERVE VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE. DOCUMENTS BY THE WAY. VERY CLEAR SAID UNDERSTAND I DO I'M GONNA START OFF WITH A QUESTION FOR MS Y. COME. I AM VERY INTERESTED KNOW AS WE SORT THROUGH ITS WERE TALKING ABOUT REPORTING BUT ALSO OF COURSE THE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU REPORT. PART IS. ELIGIBLE PARTS OF IN THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING INTO AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS BUT YOU DID TALK ABOUT THE MODEL THAT LA COUNTY HOUSE WITH THE PANEL OF. JUDGES THEIR CURRENT JUDGES NO THERE THERE OUGHT SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHO OKAY SUBJECT WE HAVE SOME RETIRED YET WE JUST ADDED A RETIRED JUDGE OKAY. BUT. MOSTLY EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS AYE THOSE OF HR BACKGROUND OKAY SO LET ME ASK YOU IT WILL BE. FIRST. THE OVERSIGHT PANEL. THANK YOU. SO WOULD LAST HERE AND A FEW CHANCES HERE BUT WE HAD AND RAVEL A FORMALLY OF THE A PPC. WHO WAS HERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR ROLE AS OVERSIGHT OF ELECTED OFFICIALS AND AND OTHER AREAS CAMPAIGN FINANCE? ON SOME SOME TYPES OF ETHICS VIOLATIONS AND SHE DID WARN ABOUT THE. OF THE. PARTICULAR. FLAVOR OF ELECTED OFFICIALS AND WHAT THE THE SORT OF THE PULL THE POLITICAL PRESSURES THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE UNDER AND SHE TALKED ABOUT ON THAT. THAT YOU KNOW. INVESTIGATING AND HAVING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYEES. BECAUSE OF THE POLITICIZING VARMINTS THAT THAT WE OPERATE IN. SO I'M JUST WONDERING. IT GIVE A IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT. AS THIS IS WORK I YOU MENTIONED THAT. THE SUPERVISORS ARE UNDER THE SAME UMBRELLA WHICH I APPRECIATE BUT I IT ALSO SEEMS THAT THEY'VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN INVESTIGATED BY THIS PANEL. SO I'M UNLESS I'VE AYE WELL I MEAN THAT THE PANEL OF REVIEWS THE INVESTIGATION RIGHT THAT MAKES AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT. BUT. YOU KNOW DOES. THE ELECTED ARE SUBJECTED TO THE SAME YOU KNOW REQUIREMENTS AS ANYONE ELSE WE'RE MINDFUL THAT IN WE WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUTSIDE. RESOURCES THAT WE CAN REACH OUT TO DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW WHO THE COMPLAINT MIGHT BE AGAINST. YEAH AND DEPENDING ON THE FACTS SO BUT IF IT'S A YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT SET OF FACTS OR A SIGNIFICANT INDIVIDUAL THE COMPLAINT IS BEING MADE AGAINST. MAYBE WILL BRING AN OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO THAT INVESTIGATION COULD SO IT IS GOODS GET FINISHED COULD JUST GET TO THE QUESTION ACTUALLY JUST I'M A. YOU KNOW WHAT SHE BROUGHT UP WAS THAT SHE FELT THAT THE F. PPC WAS VERY WELL POSITIONED TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK BECAUSE THERE ARE. YOU THERE ARE ALREADY AWARE. LET'S SAY OF. KIND OF. THE WORLD IN WHICH ELECTED OFFICIALS OPERATE I AND I'M JUST WONDERING. IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR YOUR PEER OVERSIGHT PANEL GIVEN THAT. I'D SAY NINETY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH OUR EMPLOYEES THAT WHEN THEY MAKE THAT SHIFT DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S ENOUGH GUIDANCE FOR THEM OR ENOUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTACTS WITH WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND THE GOVERNANCE ISSUES. THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS. ARE UNDER YOU KNOW IT'S WE'RE NOT EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGISLATURE WILL YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND AND KIND OF HOW THAT ACCOUNTABILITY WOULD HAPPEN WHICH WOULD BE. YOU KNOW EITHER FOR THE VOTERS OR FROM OUR COLLEAGUES YES SO DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT IT THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT THE SAME MODEL WOULD WORK WELL ARGUED THAT THIS DROP ACTUAL THINGS THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER IF WE KIND OF WENT DOWN THAT ROAD. AND AND TRY TO PURSUE SETTING UP A SIMILAR. KIND OF OF PANEL TO DEAL WITH THE LEGISLATURE I MEAN A IN MY EXPERIENCE NOW WORKING UNDER THIS MODEL FOR YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YEARS. ARMADA WORKS LIKE A CHARM WHETHER THE INVENTIVELY ON PLANES AGAINST ELECTED PERSON OR NOT I MEAN THIS IS AN AREA OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE THIS IS EMPLOYMENT LAW. AND THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE LAWS WELL DEFINED. AND YOU KNOW IT MAKES IT EASIER AT THE ELECTIONS JUST SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THE POLICY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THE ANALYSIS ON WHETHER THEY'RE. YOU KNOW WHEN EMPLOYEE ARE NOT THEY JUST PUT THEMSELVES INTO THE PROCESS BUT THAT ANALYSIS COULD BE DONE. AND I MEAN THIS IS A WORKPLACE. IN IN TODAY'S CLIMATE I WOULD. SUGGEST MOST ELECTED MAY WANT TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THIS MODEL WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THEY FEAR FEEL AND THAT WE DELIVER. FAIR OBJECTIVE MODEL. OUT WHERE THE INVESTIGATIONS OF FARO WELL DONE AND THAT WE GET TO YOU KNOW. THE THE TRUTH. I AND THAT IT'S FAIR. AND THE YOU KNOW. OVERSIGHT IS A BIG WORLD A BIG WORD OUR EQUITY OVERSIGHT PIANO IT'S REALLY JUST SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHO COME IN AND LOOK AT THE WORK PRODUCT AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO. A BACK TO THE COUNTY A WHAT THE RECOMMENDED DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE. IT'S NOT OVERSIGHT IN LIGHT THE FTP SEE SENSE OF OVERSIGHT. AND IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT DISCIPLINE AS OF. A AN EMPLOYEE. DISCIPLINE YOU KNOW CAN LOOK LIKE A SUSPENSION OR TRAINING WHAT WOULD TYPICALLY LOOK LIKE. IN THIS MODEL FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS SOMETHING SHORT OF REMOVING FROM OFFICE WHAT OTHER TYPES OF. OF DISCIPLINE. YOU KNOW WOULD YOU SEE ENVISIONED THEM OVERALL RECOMMENDING AND IF THEY'RE RECOMMENDING WHO IN OUR MODEL WOULD THEY RECOMMEND TO IF ANY THOUGHTS OF HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH THE COUNTY. I AM IN THE MODEL FOR ELECTED THE WRECK OF DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW THE SEVERITY AND THE FREQUENCY AND I AND ALL OF THAT BUT IF IT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT INNOCENT. I IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS MEN THOUGH THE RECOMMENDED DISCIPLINE COULD BE. COUNSELING IT COULD BE MEDIATION. I MEAN IT YOU KNOW AND WE'RE MINDFUL OF THE NEED TO KEEP THINGS CONFIDENTIAL IT WE VIEW IT AS A PERSONNEL MATTER AND THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO CONFIDENTIALITY. AND WE GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO GIVE THEM THAT AND PROTECT THEM. AYE AND IT'S YET THE DEPARTMENT HEAD LEVEL AT AT AT THE ELECTED LEVEL. SO THAT'S HOW WE'VE HANDLED IT AND IT'S IT'S IT'S RARE. THAT IT IS AT THAT LEVEL BUT IT HAS THE IT MAY BE AT THAT LEVEL AND WE'VE HANDLED IT I BELIEVE WELL AT THAT LEVEL. AND THEN THE WHO THE RECOMMENDATIONS BEING MADE TO THE REST OF THE SUPERVISORS. WE HAVE A A SCHEMATIC SO IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHO'S INVOLVED AND IT MAY. DEPENDING ON THAT AND MAY GO TO THE CHAIR MAY GO TO THE. YOU KNOW. THE C. E. O. AT TO DELIVER ANY WE HAVE A WE'VE WORKED IT OUT BUT AGAIN THOUGHT WAS GIVEN TO THAT POINT. ON WHO DELIVERS THAT MESSAGE ME YOU HAVE TO STARE AT SOME ORG CHARTS AND YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. OF THE HIGHWAYS THIS GOING TO WORK. FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT TRUST IN. TURNING THEMSELVES AND SUBJECTING THEMSELVES TO THIS MODEL AND THAT IT'S IT'S FAIR FOR FOLKS TO DEMAND. THAT. AND THAT WE HAVE TO DELIVER THAT THAT'S FAIR. HI SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL MOST WELCOME THANK YOU FOR. COMING FROM SUNNY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO THEM I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE KNOW THAT I NNOVA. IS IT BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE IN OZ. THANK YOU FOR THAT WELL FIRST OF ALL SENATOR MORE ALIVE AND. FOR A COPY OF YOUR POLICY AND STAY IN STAFF HAS IT BUT I JUST WANTED TO. A STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT HE MADE THAT REQUEST. SO I APPRECIATE COUPLE THINGS ON YOUR CHART I APPRECIATE THE CASE CLASSIFICATIONS A. B. C. M.. ALL BUT THAT BUT I WAS KINDA TICKLE BECAUSE THIS ALMOST LOOKS LIKE OUR HOW A BILL BECOMES A LAW CHART. PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK IS HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE IT AND GO WELL WITH WELL I'VE SAW WILLIE BROWN GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS IN HALF A DAY ONCE TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO ORANGE TO TO EUROPE. SO MY QUESTION IS. IT AND I KNOW IT'S NOT REALLY A FAIR QUESTION BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON IF IT'S ABC OR A AND. BUT WE ARE. YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S IMPATIENCE. AROUND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW AND I GET THAT. ALL MEN THERE'S ALSO DANGER IN ARTIFICIALLY RUSHING A PROCESS. AND SO BASED ON THAT I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A GUESSTIMATE. SINCE YOU'VE GOT KIND OF TO BETWEEN YOUR INTAKE SPECIALIST UNIT AND THE OVERSIGHT PANEL LOOKING AT ALL OF YOUR. CIRCLES. YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT COULD TAKE RIGHT GENERALLY JUST TO GIVE US A FRAME OF REFERENCE SO THE INTAKE THE COMPLAINTS COME IN IN REAL TIME AND WHAT WE DO AT THE INTAKE UNIT IS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED. YOU KNOW A FEW FOLKS EVERYDAY WHO LIKE WORK THE HOTLINE KIND OF SO THEY'RE REVIEWING IN REAL TIME ON OUR DATABASE. THE COMPLAINTS AS THEY COME IN AND THEY FLAG THE ONES THAT ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN OTHER ONES I MEAN A LOT THAT COMES IN. WE KNOW FROM THE BEGINNING IS JUST NOT JURISDICTIONAL OR NOT REALLY GONNA WARRANT MUCH. FURTHER INVESTIGATION BUT THE ONES THAT WILL WE FLAG EARLY ON AND THAT WE EXPEDITE THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS. NOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND WE'RE GOVERNMENT. SO YOU KNOW IF IF DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY MEAN OF COURSE IF IT'S SIGNIFICANT AND DEPENDING ON WHO'S INVOLVED WE WILL EXPEDITE THOSE AND GET THEM. THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS IN BACK IN AS QUICK A PERIOD OF TIME AS WE NEED. IF ITS A MORE RUN OF THE MILL KIND OF SITUATION THATYOU KNOW WAS A POLICY VIOLATION BUT MAYBE CO WORK ON CO WORKER. YOU KNOW WE INTERVENE IN MAYBE SEPARATE THE INDIVIDUALS IMMEDIATELY WE TAKE THAT ACTION IMMEDIATELY BUT AS FAR AS THE INVESTIGATION GOING THE FULL DISTANCE COMING BACK TO THE PANEL. IT COULD BE EIGHT MONTHS. SO YOU TRIAGE WE TRIAGE WE TRIAGE PLAIN AND SIMPLE. DO TRIAGE ON HOME. I'M SO I DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S IT BUT THE THE SIGNIFICANT ONES GET PULLED OUT AND EXPEDITED THROUGH. AND SO HOW DO EMPLOYEES KNOW WE HEARD IN THE TECHNOLOGY PARA HALT IMPORTANT INTO THAT STUDENTS TO DO SOME OF THE APPS THAT EMPLOYEES. GET THE AUTOMATIC RESPONSE THAT YOUR POINT HERE. CLAIM IS RECEIVED. THAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT HERE THE LEGISLATURE TO PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IF ANY ACTION IS TAKEN OVER JUSTICE BLACK HOLE OF INFORMATION. AND SO IF YOUR TRIAGE TEAM RIGHT HOT Y. NO ON THAT ACTION IS BEING TAKEN WHAT WHAT EVIDENCE OR WHAT. HOW DO I KNOW CHAR SO AGAIN THIS IS ALL BASED ON A DATABASE? AND WE'VE BUILT INTO THAT DATABASE ALL OF THE NECESSARY FORM LETTERS NOTIFICATION LETTERS. WEARING MY GENERATION THREE NOW WITH THIS DATABASE SO YOU KNOW WE WE IT'S IN A GOOD PLACE. AND OUR INTAKE WORKERS YOU KNOW CAN PUSH BUTTONS AND LETTERS GET GENERATED INFORMATION GETS BACK TO THE COMPLAINING PARTY TO THE INVOLVED PERSON WHO ULTIMATELY MAY BECOME THE SUBJECT. SO WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION NEED TO KNOW. AND WE'VE BUILT THAT INTO OUR SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW ALL THE FOLKS CALL US SO WE COMMUNICATE THAT WAY BUT ALSO WE JUST HAVE A LOT OF STANDARD FORMS. THAT GET TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DATABASE SO THAT TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THE LOOP. SO. HOW LONG? YOU KNOW COUNTING WORKERS STATE EMPLOYEES. THINK TANK. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT REALLY TOOK FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES TO BUY INTO THE SYSTEM AND AND AND HOW? WAS IT APPEAR TO YOU THAT CULTURE SHIFT HAD BEGUN TO HAPPEN. SO I'LL TALK ABOUT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. IT TOOK. THREE TO FIVE YEARS. FOR THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO BUY ONE. AND. THE DAY I KNEW IT CHANGED. WAS THE DAY WHEN ONE OF THE FIERCEST OPPONENTS. CALLED ME AND WAS ABOUT TO FILE A COMPLAINT. AND WAS NOT ALLOWED HIMSELF BUT ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE AND WAS SO HAPPY THAT THERE WAS A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT THEY COULD JUST REFER THINGS TO. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE LEARNED TO THIS PROCESS WELL INITIALLY THERE WAS RESISTANCE. THE COUNTY LEVEL TO DEPARTMENT HEADS OUT WE SHOULD BE EXEMPTED WE SHOULDN'T BE PART OF THIS PROCESS JUST XIN APPLIED WHAT'S WERE DIFFERENT. AND WE WENT TO THAT TRAINING EXPLAINING YOU'RE NOT DIFFERENT NOT DIFFERENT UNDER THE LAW. BUT. ULTIMATELY UP THEY THEY YOU KNOW THEY GET ON BOARD BUT AT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THE DAY THAT CHIEF CALLED AND TOLD ME. HE WAS HAPPY THERE IS A PROCESS WAS FOLLOWING THE PROCESS I KNEW THINGS HAD CHANGED AND A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHO'D BEEN INVOLVED IN BUILDING THIS PROCESS IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. WAS ON AN AIRPLANE ONE DAY AT A FEMALE DEPUTY SHERIFFS THAT NEXT TO WHERE SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS AND THE FEMALE DEPUTY SHERIFF WAS GOING ON AND ON ABOUT HOW HAPPY. AS SHE WAS TO WORK IN A CULTURE. WE'RE REPORTING WAS THE NO ARMOR YOU'RE ENCOURAGED TO REPORT. AND MY COLLEAGUE FRIEND. WAS JUST ELATED BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN THERE WHEN THAT WASN'T THE CULTURE. SO I WOULD SAY THREE TO FIVE YEARS BEFORE YOU SEE BY EN. NOT TO NOT TO SUGGEST THAT. IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THREE TO FIVE YEARS. BUT BEFORE IT FOLKS KINDA SIMMER DOWN AND IT'S JUST ROUTINE IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IT IS THE NORM IS TO FILE A COMPLAINT. THAT'S THE NORM. THAT FOR THAT TIME FROM TO BE REFLECTED IN A MALE DOMINATED. HIERARCHICAL ENTITY LIKE A LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION IS IMPRESSIVE. THEY DON'T YEAR. WE JUST WANT CLARIFY ONE THING WHEN YOU SAID EIGHT MONTHS AGO THE PROCESS IS THAT INCLUDING SORT OF A WAIT TIME BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BACKLOG OF THESE ARE IS THAT YOU START. DAY ONE INVESTIGATING AND THEN THE TAKES EIGHT MONTHS WE KNOW WE HAVE A BACKLOG ANYWHERE TO LISTEN TO YOU START DAY ONE HOW LONG WOULD THE PROCESS TIP I KNOW EVERY CASE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT LET'S SAY YOU'RE KIND OF. ON EIGHT WEEKS THE OKAY. OKAY LET ME THAT ARE NOT IT'S NOT AN ELABORATE IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE IT REALLY ISN'T. IT'S BEEN UP AND RUNNING FOR MANY YEARS MOST PLACES. IT'S JUST BUILDING A MODEL THAT WORKS AND IMPLEMENTING IT AND THEN RUNNING IT. WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE YOU NEED TO HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE I CAN'T TURN IT OVER TO JUST ANYBODY. JUST ISN'T A CITIZENS COMMISSION. NOW. IT IS NOT. THE OTHER PIECE FOLLOW YOUR QUESTIONS ON AT THE SEE. LALATE HOW THE RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT OVER ELECTED THEY'RE NOT SUBSCRIBER EXPERTS THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE YES I HEARD LOUDLY. ABSOLUTELY. ANYONE FROM THE SENATE THAT. THE DIETS. SOME REMEMBER IT. THANK YOU. HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE ON STAFF THAT TAKE CARE OF THIS PART OF? FOR THE LA COUNTY. THE INTAKE UNIT. EMPLOYEES ABOUT TWENTY. MY RECOLLECTION IS TWENTY I DON'T I DON'T I'M NOT OVER IT ANYMORE I'M DOING THE COUNTY COUNCIL WORK NOW BUT ABOUT TWENTY. IN THE COUNTY DE HR OF WHO DOES THE FURTHER INVESTIGATION THEY HAVE ABOUT ANOTHER TWENTY INVESTIGATORS. A PANEL OF THE OVERSIGHT PANEL WE HAVE NINE MEMBERS THEY CONVENE IN GROUPS OF THREE. YOU KNOW MONEY IT TAKES MONEY TO OPERATE THIS MODEL. BUT YOU SAVE MONEY ON THE BACK AND I MEAN WE'VE AND YOU CHANGE THE CULTURE. I AM IN THE PROCESS THAT'S KEY IT MANY EMPLOYEES TO JUST SAY YOU HAVE. SO I'D SAY ABOUT TWENTY IT WORK THE INTAKE UNIT THEN I'M SORRY. HOW MANY PLOY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND? ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OKAY. AND IT IT. THOSE REELS. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT IN OUR PROCESS WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE EACH OF THE COLLEGES THERE'S ONE EQUITY OFFICER EACH COLLEGE. PLUS A THREE FOLKS SUMMARY CHART APARTMENT THAT ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED. WHEN WE GET BEYOND THAT LEVEL WE HIRE OUTSIDE FOLKS TO HELP US AND SO TYPICAL INVESTIGATIONS TAKE NINETY DAYS OR LESS. IN OUR ORGANIZATION. AND I'M SORRY THAT FOR THE FIRST FOR YOUR QUESTION. WITHOUT A AYE MANY EMPLOYEES HOW MANY PLACE TOTAL DO YOU HAVE. WELL NONE OF THEM DOES THIS FULL TIME SO THERE'S ABOUT TWELVE FOLKS INTERNALLY THAT HANDLE THIS ON AND ON A PART TIME BASIS THEY HAVE OTHER JOBS AT THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WE WE WHERE MANY MANY HATS AS WE DO OUR. AND HOW MANY EMPLOYEES TOTAL DO YOU HAVE THE AT THE AS. ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND PLUS OR MINUS PLUS REMEMBER WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS IN OUR PROGRAM DOES ENCOMPASS BOTH STUDENT COMPLAINTS AS WELL AS FACULTY AND STAFF ADMINISTRATION COMPLAINTS. WONDERFUL AND I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE WE'VE YES BUT FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH THE. THAT THIS WAS A. VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION BRINGS IT BACK TO. SOMETHING THAT IS CLOSER TO WHAT IT IS WE DO. OWN HAVE YOUR SUPERVISORS SEE UP THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AS WELL AS EMPLOYEES AND SUPERVISORS AT ARE YOUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS YES MA'AM THEIR LOCALLY ELECTED NOW I WOULD TELL YOU IF A BOARD OF IF SOMEONE MADE A COMPLAINT ABOUT ONE OF OUR TRUSTEES OR CHANCELLOR. ONE OF OUR EXECUTIVE STAFF WE WOULD GO IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE COUNSEL THAT WOULD NOT BE HANDLED BY INTERNAL FOLKS IT'S. THE POWER DYNAMIC IS JUST TOO LARGE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. AND I BELIEVE IN OUR SITUATION WE WOULD BE REPORTING BACK TO THE FULL BOARD WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN YOUR LEGISLATURE OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY FOLKS I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WORKS FOR YOU BUT THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING. WE DON'T KNOW YET EITHER. WHAT WE'VE I WANT TO GO BACK TO WE'VE BECAUSE AT THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED HERE AS WELL AND I KNOW THE QUESTIONS? HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED SO. I WANT TO BE CLEAR IN MY MIND. WHEN YOU HIRE A SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR. THAT PERSON IS NOT A MANDATORY REPORTER THEM. AND THE WORD MANDATORY REPORTERS LOADED IN THAT CONTEXT AND IT MAKES A PERSON WHO IS A MINOR. WE ARE ALL MANDATORY REPORTER SO THERE IS NO CONFIDENTIALITY IF YOU CAME AND SAID YOU WERE ASSAULTED AS A MINOR. WORTH YOUR MINOR CHILD CAME AND SAID I WAS ASSAULTED SO LET'S JUST PUT THAT IN THE PARKING LOT FOR A MOMENT. EVERYONE ELSE THAT WOULD COME TO OUR WE'VE CONFIDENTIAL REPORTER THERE IS NO REPORTING THAT THEY MAKE AT ALL. THAT VARIAS AYE THAT'S A HUNDRED PERCENT REAL IT'S ESSENTIALLY A A PATIENT AND COUNCIL OR PRIVILEGE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. AND IF THE PATIENT SAYS I'D LIKE YOU SHARE THIS INFORMATION OR YOUR AUTHORISES SURE THIS INFORMATION THEN THE COUNSELOR MAY IF THE PATIENT SAYS NO. THEN I AS I READ THE LAW THAT COUNCIL HAS APPROVED THE PRIVILEGE AND IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE PRIVILEGE OF THE PERSON WHO BRINGS THE REPORT. YOU SAY THAT YOU RECEIVE. DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION YES. DOES THIS PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO THAT IF YOU RECEIVE INFORMATION THAT THERE WAS A RAPE A CRIMINAL. ACT. IS THAT BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE POLICE SO THEY DO THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION. THE INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE IN THAT PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO TURN ANYTHING OVER TO THE POLICE THE POLICE WOULD BE ADVISED OF THAT BECAUSE AS COLLEGES WE ALSO HAVE OUR CLEARY OBLIGATIONS TO REPORT CRIMINAL ACTIONS THAT HAPPEN ON OUR CAMPUS. AND THAT'S ONE REASON WE ASK FOR THE DE IDENTIFIED DATA TO MAKE SURE WERE FULFILLING THAT FEDERAL OBLIGATION. ON THE OTHER REASON IS TO MAKE SURE WERE IDENTIFYING PATTERNS. OR PATTERNS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING VICTIMIZED PROBLEMS OF PLACES THAT ARE WERE VICTIMIZATION IS OCCURRING. PATTERNS WHERE WE WE CAN DO SOMETHING AS A COLLEGE TO SAY WE'RE GONNA STOP WHATEVER'S HAPPENING OVER IN THAT SPOT. THAT'S THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WE MIGHT GET FROM SOMEONE ON DE IDENTIFIED BASIS BUT THERE BE NO WAY FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS. AYE GIVEN THE DE IDENTIFIED REPORT TO DO ANYTHING BEYOND THAT. IN MY FINAL QUESTION IS. MOST OF MOST OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT AS OPPOSED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BOB IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT HANDLED DIFFERENTLY. I BELIEVE THAT IF SOMEONE WERE. SEXUALLY HARASSED HIM AND WANTED TO ACCESS OUR WE'VE PERSON THEY WOULD HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT AND IT WOULD BE HANDLED THE SAME WAY. TYPICALLY THEY DON'T ASK FOR AN ADVOCATE IN THAT CONTEXT. ENDS OR NORMAL PROCESS YOU ARE SCARED XIN AND DISCIPLINE APPLY TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IF YOU THE QUESTIONS. WITH THAT THANK YOU WANNA THANK THE PANEL VERY VERY MUCH THIS WAS REALLY REALLY HELPFUL. AND WITHOUT A MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENTS WOMAN ASK ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT. PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. ANYBODY. CARE TO COMMENT. OKAY SEEING NONE I DO WANNA ANNOUNCED THAT NEXT TUESDAY WERE HAVING OUR NEXT HEARING. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE JOINED WITH. SOMEONE WHO I THINK WILL BE FASCINATING FOR ALL OF US AND THAT'S RETIRED CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CARLOS MORENO. IT'S GOING TO BE CONTINUING TO DELVE INTO THE ISSUES AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY AND A DUE PROCESS. I WITH THAT THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED
