MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.551
SERVICES FROM THE STATE A COURT

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.553
DETERMINED THAT THE PERSON WAS

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.888
NO LONGER A DANGER TO OTHERS AND

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.757
COULD SAFELY BE RETURNED TO THE

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:11.624
COMMUNITY. HOWEVER UNDER

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.626
SUPERVISION THAT IS THE PURPOSE

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.695
OF THE CONRAD PROGRAM. ONCE THIS

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.630
DETERMINATION WAS MADE IT WAS

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.399
THEN UP TO THE COURT TO WORK

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.700
WITH THE STATE TO FIND A

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.368
SUITABLE HOUSING PLACEMENT FOR

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:24.437
THIS INDIVIDUAL. CONSISTENT WITH

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:25.905
OTHER RULES LIKE RADIUS

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:28.441
RESTRICTIONS AND ENSURING GPS

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:30.410
SURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING. BUT

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.578
WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED WHERE THE

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.314
S. V. P. WOULD BE PLACED THERE

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.349
WAS SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC OUTCRY.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:37.550
PARENTS AND FAMILIES WERE

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:38.851
CONCERNED AND ON FIRST

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.887
IMPRESSION I TOO WAS INCREDIBLY

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.956
CONCERNED. THE COMMUNITY SAID

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.390
THAT THERE WERE FLAWS IN THE

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:45.892
PROCESS AND THAT THERE WAS NO

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.661
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE STATE.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.697
AND LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES. SO I

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.967
TOOK A DEEP LOOK AT HOW WE CAN

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:54.500
ENSURE THAT LOCAL JUSTICE

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.736
PARTNERS COULD BE HEARD IN THESE

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:57.937
CRITICAL HOUSING PLACEMENT

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.772
DECISIONS. AND HOW TO KEEP OUR

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.574
COMMUNITY SAFE WHILE ALSO

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:03.443
RESPECTING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.712
RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS IS A

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:08.014
RESPONSIBILITY THAT REQUIRES BY

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.450
LAW US TO RE INTEGRATE BACK INTO

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.151
SOCIETY INDIVIDUALS WHO SERVE

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:13.853
THEIR TIME AND WHOSE MENTAL

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.555
DISORDER HAS BEEN TREATED SO

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.557
THAT IS SAFE FOR THEM TO BE

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:18.157
SUPERVISED BACK IN THE

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.293
COMMUNITY. SINCE THE INCEPTION

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.895
OF THE PROGRAM IN NINETEEN

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.263
NINETY SIX THERE HAVE BEEN FIFTY

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.332
ONE S. B. P.'S PLACED INTO

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:28.568
CONRAD INTO THE PROGRAM. NONE OF

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.937
WHO HAVE RE OFFENDED AS PART OF

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:32.438
THE PROGRAM THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.407
ARE CLOSELY MONITORED DRUG

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:39.012
TESTED GPS TRACKED AND RECEIVE

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:40.613
ONGOING TREATMENT AND SUPPORT.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.750
CONVERSELY EIGHT ESCAPEES HAVE

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:44.751
BEEN RELEASED TO TRANSIENT

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:47.120
STATUS WITHOUT ANY CONDITIONS OR

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.921
SURVEILLANCE OR MONITORING

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:50.990
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.225
THEIR COMMUNITIES TO FIND

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.594
SUITABLE HOUSING FOR THEM. AND I

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.663
DON'T THINK THAT'S OKAY. I IN

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.431
WHERE THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE

00:04:58.498 --> 00:04:59.565
IMPROVED IT'S NOT OKAY FOR THE

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.335
COMMUNITY IT'S NOT OKAY FOR THE

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:05.004
INDIVIDUAL. SO SB TEN THIRTY

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.339
FOUR IS INTENDED TO CREATE A

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.574
MORE STRUCTURED PROCESS FOR ALL

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.710
RELEVANT COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:13.212
TO COLLECTIVELY MAKE APPROPRIATE

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.180
LOCAL HOUSING PLACEMENT

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:16.616
DECISIONS. WHILE BALANCING OUR

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:19.152
CONSTITUTIONAL OLIGATIONS THIS

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:21.387
IN TURN WOULD REDUCE THE RISK OF

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.456
TRANSIENT PLACEMENT ALL OF WHICH

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:27.694
ULTIMATELY INCREASES PUBLIC

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.429
PREVENT ONE COUNTY FROM PASSING

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.831
THE BUCK BASICALLY AND JUST

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.467
MOVING THEIR SVP INTO ANOTHER

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:37.670
JURISDICTION SB TEN THIRTY FOUR

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.639
CREATES A MORE DETAILED PROCESS

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.741
FOR HOW A COURT MAY AUTHORIZE A

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.876
COUNTY TO PLACE AN STP INTO

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:46.179
ANOTHER JURISDICTION FOR ME THAT

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.347
IS A FAIRNESS ISSUE. AT THE END

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.316
OF THE DAY A JURISDICTION THAT

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.318
PLACES A PERSON INTO THE SYSTEM

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.187
SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:56.122
WHEN THEY COME OUT. RESEARCH

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.590
SHOWS OR HAS SHOWN THAT

00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:58.958
INDIVIDUALS RELEASED BACK INTO

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.593
THEIR HOME COMMUNITY THEIR

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.929
DOMICILE RESIDENCE WHERE THEY

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.630
HAVE TIES TO THE COMMUNITY ARE

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:07.734
LESS LIKELY TO RE OFFEND. SO SB

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.068
TEN THIRTY FOUR IS ATTEMPTING TO

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.203
CREATE A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:11.504
THAT CREATES ADDITIONAL

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:14.207
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:16.876

EVERYONE COME TO THE TABLE THAT

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.778
DOESN'T HAPPEN IT LEAVES THE

JUDGE IN THE POSITION OF HAVING

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:45.117

THE CONTRACTOR WITH THE STATE

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:49.054
HOSPITALS AND TO MAKE A

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.223
DETERMINATION- WHEN I TALK ABOUT

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.225
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:54.793
IT IS HAVING EVERY STAKEHOLDER

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.496
AT THE TABLE PLAYING THEIR ROLE.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.632
OUGHT TO DETERMINE THAT THE

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.600
ACCOUNTABILITY IS TAKEN AND THAT

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:02.968
THERE IS TRANSPARENCY ON BEHALF

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:04.970
OF THE PUBLIC. AND THE RIVER

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.305
TAKE REPRESENTATION IS THERE FOR

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.607
THE INDIVIDUAL BEING CONSIDERED

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:10.809
SO. WHILE IT THE ISSUE IS IT

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:12.111
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE MANDATED

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:13.612
BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO COME TO

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.681
THE TABLE AND THE SECOND PIECE

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.716
SO IN RESPONSE WE DON'T THINK

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:18.617
THERE'S A CONFLICT WE WILL

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:20.786
CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:23.455
WE WANT BETTER OUTCOMES- IN THE

MUCH. AND THAT THIS IS NOT A

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.769
PROBLEM AND IT'S NOT URGENT. WHY

IS RIGHT. NOT IT IS VERY ROBUST

00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:01.751
MY BILL IS VERY ROBUST I ADMIT

00:52:01.818 --> 00:52:04.788
THAT- THERE'S A LOT IN IT- AND

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:06.623
THAT'S PURPOSELY LISO BECAUSE WE

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.758
WANT TO FLUSH OUT A LOT OF THESE

00:52:08.825 --> 00:52:11.628
ISSUES. I WOULD LIKE- IF THE

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:13.263
BILL DOESN'T PASS TODAY

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.165
RECONSIDERATION. TO HAVE AN

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:18.268
OPPORTUNITY TO RE ENGAGE WITH

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:19.402
THE MEMBERS AND COME UP WITH A

00:52:19.469 --> 00:52:20.737
SOLUTION THAT DOES WORK. THE

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.572
PURPOSE OF MY BILL TODAY IS TO

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:25.909
PROTECT. RESIDENTS ANDERSON

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:29.446
FAMILIES CHILDREN WOMEN ABOUT

THE ENTIRE STATE YES THIS HAS

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:34.584
BECOME A SAN DIEGO POINTED ISSUE

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:37.621
BUT IT'S A IT'S A STATE ISSUE

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:40.690
AND- I THINK BASED ON THE

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:42.425
ROBUSTNESS OF THE MEMBERS

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:44.160
ENGAGEMENT FROM THE SENATE

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:46.563
DELEGATION AND THE BILLS THAT

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.231
ARE BEING PRESENTED. THIS SHOULD

00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:50.500
BE IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US AND

00:52:50.567 --> 00:52:51.935
HEIGHTEN OUR ATTENTION TO THE

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:54.237
WHOLE THING- ONE OF THE- THINGS

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:56.006
THAT MY BILL DOES SUPPORT A

00:52:56.072 --> 00:52:58.108
PROPOSED IS THAT. THE SECTION

00:52:58.174 --> 00:52:59.676
ABOUT PREDATORS BE PLACED ON

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:00.944
STATE PROPERTY THAT'S THE

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.846
PURPOSE OF THE REPORTS FROM THE

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:05.215
VARIOUS AGENCIES. PRIOR

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:06.516
GOVERNORS HAVE ORDERED THOSE

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.518
PLACEMENTS THEY SEEM TO HAVE

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:10.353
WORKED IN THE PAST AND WE THINK

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.788
THAT THEY COULD WORK AGAIN AND

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.456
WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR AYE

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:14.958

MOTION- BY SENATOR WIENER- AND-

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:25.302
TO MOVE THE BELL. AND THE MOTION

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:26.236
IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST RE

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:28.672

YES THE WHOLE THING'S BEEN OUT

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:37.347
OF WORK SO IF. I FEEL LIKE LIFE

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:40.016

YES SO- I FEEL LIKE I WAS ALSO

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:54.698
GOING TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:56.700
THAT SENATOR WIENER ASK BECAUSE

00:53:56.766 --> 00:54:00.003
MY CONFUSION WAS THAT- IF

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:07.344
SOMEONE IS. CURRENTLY PRESENTS A

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.613
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER THEN

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:13.683
THEY ARE NOT RELEASED- BUT THEN

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.719
ALSO YOUR AND THEN I JUST HER I

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.454
FEEL LIKE I JUST HEARD YOU SAY

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.356
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:20.523
YOU'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING IS

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:21.992
ESSENTIALLY LIKE A STATE PENAL

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:24.461
COLONY FOR FOLKS TO BE ON. NOT

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:26.830
NEXT NON ARE NOT NECESSARILY

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:30.333
COLONY AT AND- BUT A PLACEMENT

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.770
ON STATE PROPERTY. WHERE THEY

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:35.972
CAN BE. DETERMINED THAT THAT'S A

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:37.540
SAFER PLACE FOR THEM TO BE

00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:39.376
PLACED I'M NOT. POSING THAT WE

00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.778
PUT THEM ALL IN THE SAME PLACE-

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:43.413
LIKE A CALLING KNOW THAT. THAT'S

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.448
NOT MY INTENT. OKAY THE OTHER

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:47.851
THING THAT I WHEN I WHEN READING

00:54:47.917 --> 00:54:51.121
IT. IT SAYS THAT THE VIOLENT

00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:51.955
PREDATORS HAVE. HISTORICALLY

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:53.657
BEEN DONE IT PLACE PLACE HAS

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:55.091
BEEN HISTORICALLY DONE IN SECRET

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:58.995
AND DECEPTIVE WAYS BY THE STATE

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:00.397
- AND SO I WAS SOMEWHAT

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:02.999
INTRIGUED. AND CONFUSED BY THAT

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:05.502
BECAUSE IT. SUGGESTS THAT THE

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:08.705
STATE IS INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:11.908
PLACE PEOPLE- IN AREAS THAT

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.843
PRESENT A DANGER PROBABLY TO

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:16.613
THEM BUT ALSO TO NEIGHBORHOODS

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.782
WHERE THEY ARE RESIDING. AND

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:20.250
THERE WAS AN INTENTION OUT THERE

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:21.685
DID THERE'S A AND AN INFERRED

00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:24.587
INTENTIONALITY TO THAT

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:27.290
STATEMENT. AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:31.861
THAT IS. THE CASE ARM. AND I

00:55:31.928 --> 00:55:33.196
DIDN'T KNOW IF MAYBE SOMEONE

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:37.233
COULD EXPLAIN WHY THAT. IN THERE

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.602
AND THE ASSUMPTION BEHIND THEM-

00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:42.439
AND THEN ALSO BASED ON WHAT I

00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:45.942
WAS READING IN THE ANALYSIS. THE

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:47.177
IT SEEMS TO ME AND MAYBE I'M

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:49.813
WRONG. BUT IF THIS IS ABOUT

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.881
COUNTIES. AND IF YOU HAVE A

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:55.118
BOARD THAT IS AGAINST PLACEMENTS

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:57.554
OR MIGHT BE AGAINST A PARTICULAR

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.956
PERSON THEY COULD CONCEIVABLY

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:03.526
DRAG THIS WHOLE PROCESS OUT IN

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:05.361
THE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER GET PLACE

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:07.664
. OR IS THAT NOT TRUE YEAH I CAN

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:08.832
I THINK I CAN ADDRESS BOTH

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.867
QUESTIONS OKAY WITH ONE

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:12.869
EXPLANATION I LITERALLY. WHEN

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:15.171
THE STATE TURNS THE RELEASE SEE

00:56:15.238 --> 00:56:17.207
OVER TO THE CONTRACTOR. THE

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:18.942
STATE AT THAT POINT TIME

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:21.177
BRAUNTON SUPPORTS IT PURPOSES

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:22.946
QUITS PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S

00:56:23.012 --> 00:56:24.481
GOING ON SO THEY- WASH THEIR

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.149
HANDS OF THE SITUATION. THE

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.484
CONTRACTOR THEN GOES OUT AND

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:32.021
LEASES A HOME. AND THEN-

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:34.124
ANNOUNCES OR WHATEVER THAT

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:35.492
THEY'RE GONNA PLACE THIS

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:37.093
SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR IN

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.762
THIS PARTICULAR HOME AT THAT

00:56:38.828 --> 00:56:41.664
POINT TIME THAT'S WIN THE COUNTY

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:43.600
. HERE'S ABOUT IT THAT'S WHEN

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.502
THEY COMMUNITY HEARS ABOUT IT

00:56:45.568 --> 00:56:46.770
THAT'S WHEN THE NEIGHBORS HERE

EVERY EVENT THAT THEY GO TO AS

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:02.185
TO WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. AND

00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:04.788
WHAT WE WANT TO CHANGE IS THAT

00:57:04.854 --> 00:57:06.523
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE BILL

00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:09.392
PROPOSES TO DO TO FIX THAT IS

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:12.662
BEFORE THE CONTRACTOR CAN SIGN

00:57:12.729 --> 00:57:14.798
THE LEASE. THE DIRECTOR OF STATE

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:16.900
HOSPITALS HAS TO APPROVE IT.

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:17.667

A QUESTION THIS IS THE THIRD

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:52.567
BILL ON THIS AND YOU KNOW WHEN I

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:54.603
GOT THAT. AND NOW IT SAYS THE

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:56.505
OTHER DAY. I THOUGHT WELL

01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:58.407
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN SAN

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:00.375
DIEGO. BUT WAS THERE ANY

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:01.710
DISCUSSION TO CONSOLIDATE THE

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:04.880
BILLS OR TO KIND OF. BECAUSE IT

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:06.548
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A COMPACTED.

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.417
AND YET PROTRACTED ISSUE GOING

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:11.820
ON. IN THIS PARTICULAR REGION

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.789
BUT WHERE THEIR WORK WAS SO.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:14.856
BECAUSE THAT IS THE GOAL HAVE TO

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:17.826
ASK OUR CONSULTANT- ERIC WOULD

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:19.928
YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT WE-

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:22.197
WE ANALYZE THREE BILLS ON IN

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:25.300
PUBLIC SAFETY ON THE S. AND P.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:27.169
AND THE QUESTION IS WAS THERE A

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.237
THOUGHT. ABOUT CONSOLIDATING

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:31.406
BILLS. AND THAT WAS NOT PROVIDED

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:32.574
TO ME BECAUSE MINE TAKES A

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:34.743
DIFFERENT TACT OF SPECIFICALLY I

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.711
KNOW I GET THAT AND I NOTICED

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.814
THAT EACH OF THE KIND OF HAVE A

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.948
DIFFERENT. PATH AND YET I FEEL

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:42.517
LIKE EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT-

01:18:42.584 --> 01:18:44.219
AND HOW TO ADDRESS THE SAME

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:47.856
ISSUE WHICH IS HOW DO YOU. YOU

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.826
KNOW LEGALLY CONSTITUTIONALLY

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:54.763
MANAGE THE PLACEMENT OF S. V.

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:58.433
PEAS BACK INTO A COMMUNITY- IN A

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.268
WAY THAT IS TRANSPARENT IN A WAY

01:19:00.335 --> 01:19:01.803
THAT IS LAWFUL IN A WAY THAT

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.039
PROTECTS COMMUNITIES AND IN A

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:08.643
WAY THAT IS- PLAN. RECOGNIZING

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:09.811
THAT THERE ARE ETHICAL

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.046
CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:13.415
CONCERNS RECOGNIZING THAT THERE

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:15.317
ARE FIXES THAT NEED TO BE MADE

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:18.987
BUT IT ALSO SEEMS. JUST ARM I

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:20.489
WAS JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE OFTEN

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:26.962
TIMES. WE DON'T HAVE- THESE

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.697
KINDS OF BILLS COME BEFORE A

01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:30.432
PUBLIC SAFETY AND THEN TO HAVE

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:32.434
THREE OF THEM FROM AUTHORED BY

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:35.303
FOLKS IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:37.172
IT JUST STRUCK ME AS IF THERE

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:43.445
WAS A WAY TO SORT OF. CONJOIN OR

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:46.481
YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF CREATE

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.550
SOMETHING THAT'S MORE HOLISTIC.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.485
OR AT LEAST JUST ADDRESSES IT SO

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:53.188
THAT WAS MY OWN MY OWN QUESTION

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:54.689
YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:55.857
SENATOR CALL LOGGER AND I

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:57.025
WOULDN'T DISAGREE I THINK YOU

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:58.994
HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE FOCUS

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.795
OF EACH BILL IS AND I'M A LITTLE

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:02.898
ODD. UNINFORMED I DIDN'T I

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:04.266
WASN'T ABLE TO WATCH THE

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:07.002
DISCUSSION ON NOW SENATOR- PRO

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:08.770
TEM'S BILL THIS MORNING BUT HERS

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:11.106
AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT ADDS THE

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:12.040
DA TWO ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.575
THAT CAN BE AT THE TABLE LONGER

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.143
DISCUSSING PLACEMENT WHAT I'D

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.778
LIKE TO FOCUS ON WITH MY BILL

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:18.747
WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE LAW AS IT

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:20.315
CURRENTLY STANDS AND WHERE THEY

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:22.083
MIGHT BE PLAY STARS OF FOCUSING

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:24.352
ON. OF THE ABILITY TO PLACE AN

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:27.489
INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS CONVICTED IN

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:29.324
ONE COUNTY AND HAVE SERVED THEIR

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.825
TIME BOB SUPPOSEDLY ARE NO

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.594
LONGER A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.229
YET THEY'RE NOT PLACE BACK IN

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:35.997
THAT COUNTY WHICH IS PART OF A

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:37.766
CURRENTLY PART OF THE PROCESS SO

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.734
WHY IS THAT IS BECAUSE QUOTE

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:40.335
UNQUOTE THERE'S EXTRAORDINARY

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:42.837
CIRCUMSTANCES MY BILL IS ASKING

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:44.973
FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUT. NOW I

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.274
KNOW THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:48.009
CONCERNED ABOUT PRIVACY BUT I

01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:49.377
CONSIDER EXTRAORDINARY

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:50.946
CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE SOMETHING

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:52.380
ABOUT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THAT

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:53.682
OTHER COUNTY NOT WHAT'S

01:20:53.748 --> 01:20:55.050
HAPPENING NOW IS THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:56.651
WHO MIGHT BE STRUGGLING WITH

01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:58.787
CONCERNS BY HAVING YOU KNOW

01:20:58.853 --> 01:21:01.189
IMPROPER THOUGHTS ARE IT IS

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:03.258
ABOUT WHETHER THEY WERE-

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:04.626
RECOMMITTED FROM THAT OTHER

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.629
COUNTY THEY CAME IN. CONTACT

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.064
WITH YOU KNOW THERE'S THEIR PEER

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:10.999
GROUP AGAIN WHATEVER THOSE ARE

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:12.601
NOT THINGS THAT GO TO THE HEART

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:14.236
OF THAT DISCUSSION BETWEEN A

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:15.370
PSYCHOTHERAPIST IN THE

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:17.973
INDIVIDUAL SO I DO BELIEVE IT'S

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:18.740
LEGITIMATE TO PROVIDE TO A

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:20.542
COUNTY IN A PRIVACY SETTING THE

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:22.644
JUDGE AND THE PROSECUTOR AND THE

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.246
DEFENSE ATTORNEY ON WHAT WERE

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:26.081

OTHER DOWN THE BEHAVIORAL

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:29.584
MODIFICATION ISSUES WITH THE

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:31.553
INDIVIDUAL SO IT SEEMS TO ME

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.288
THAT THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:37.859
OF MY BILL. SHOULD BE INCLUDED

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:39.728
RECEIVING COUNTY BECAUSE WHEN

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:41.396
YOU HAVE ONE COUNTY SAN DIEGO

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:42.931
THAT CURRENTLY HAS SIXTEEN OF

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:44.366
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:50.105
PACIFIC LEE IN THEIR COUNTY.

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:50.839

NOW THEY'RE BEING PLACED IN SAN

01:21:57.712 --> 01:21:59.381
DIEGO WHICH MIGHT BE QUITE A

01:21:59.447 --> 01:22:01.149
DISTANCE FROM THEIR ORIGINAL

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:01.850
DOMICILE. THAT'S THAT'S A SIMPLE

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:03.918
QUESTION. THAT COULD BE PROVIDED

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.887
PRIVACY CLEARLY IN THE

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:07.422
DISCUSSION AS THE PERSON IS

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.758
BEING PLACED NOW WHEN THEY GET

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:11.192
TO THAT PARTICULAR HOME. AND THE

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.527
THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN OUR

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:13.962
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VERY

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:16.131
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WELL THOSE

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:18.133
ARE. THOSE ARE THE RIGHT OF THE

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:19.734
PUBLIC- TO RESIST IN HAVE. THEIR

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:21.436
THEIR DAY IN THE IN THE PUBLIC

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:23.972
ARENA IT DOESN'T MEAN AUDIT YET

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:25.507
TARA IS GRANTED DOWN BUT

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:26.808
CERTAINLY A DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.777
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:30.478
INFORMATION. VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:32.614
SENATOR WIENER. TO TALK TO

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:33.848
PEOPLE WITH PITCHFORKS IF YOU

01:22:33.915 --> 01:22:35.717
PUT THIS PERSON IN MY COMMUNITY.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.786
AND HE DID A VERY GOOD

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:38.486
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:40.255
HIM WHEN HE WAS A LOCAL

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:40.889
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. SO WE NEED

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:42.157
THAT INFORMATION WHEN WE ARE

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:44.259
THERE. ON THE DÍAS TRYING TO

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:46.361
EXPLAIN WHY YOU KNOW. ALL WE

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.862
WENT THROUGH ALL THE PROCESS

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:50.332
FOUND OUT WHY THEY HAD TO COME

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:50.932
TO SAN DIEGO OR ORANGE COUNTY

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:52.667
INSTEAD OF RIVERSIDE. AND I

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:53.868
THINK THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:55.503
PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR AND I DON'T

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.172
SEE THAT THAT'S A VIOLATION. OF

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.440
PRIVACY OF THIS PARTICULAR

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:00.508
INDIVIDUAL NOT GOING INTO. YOU

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:02.410
KNOW THE THAT HE STILL FEELS

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:04.346
THAT HE NEEDS TO DO X. Y. NZ

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:08.717
THAT SAW CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:10.485
CRIME AGAINST SOMEONE ELSE.

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:11.820

THIS ONE GO FORWARD WE CERTAINLY

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.626
CAN CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH THE

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.495
OPPOSITION WE DID A LOT OF WORK

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:22.630
WE REMOVED ALL OF THE OLD. THE

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:23.431
GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS WERE

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:25.100
TALKING ABOUT TAKING THE TIME

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:26.167
LIMITS OUT MAYBE THOSE NEED TO

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:28.103
BE THE SAME WITH EXTENDED IT WE

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:30.138
DOUBLE THAT ACTUALLY. BUT THOSE

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.773
ARE THINGS THAT CAN CERTAINLY BE

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.009
DONE IN A FASTER- SETTING-

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:36.778

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:52.961
CIRCUMSTANCES IF THEY ARE

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:55.296

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.399
DISCUSSED AND I WOULD LIKE. OF

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.401
THAT PART OF THE BILL- TO BE.

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:02.303
HONORED TODAY AND THEN WE ARE

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:03.138

I'LL BE HONEST- I ALSO THIS IS A

02:38:13.317 --> 02:38:15.319
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE- IN VARIOUS

PARTS OF THE STATE WITH THESE

02:38:16.653 --> 02:38:19.356
ILLEGAL GROWS THAT ARE REALLY.

02:38:19.423 --> 02:38:20.924
DEEPLY DESTRUCTIVE

02:38:20.991 --> 02:38:23.660
ENVIRONMENTALLY- REALLY REALLY

02:38:23.727 --> 02:38:27.097
REALLY HARMFUL AND BAD- SO THIS

02:38:27.164 --> 02:38:29.233
KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS NOT. IT'S

CANNABIS SALES ON THE VAST

02:39:25.322 --> 02:39:27.891
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA CITIES

02:39:27.958 --> 02:39:30.861
62% TO BE PRECISE. CATEGORICALLY

02:39:30.928 --> 02:39:33.530
BANNED ANY AT ALL SALE OF

02:39:33.597 --> 02:39:36.400
CANNABIS SO IT'S LEGAL FOR

SYSTEM I'M SORRY IT'S JUST A

02:39:46.576 --> 02:39:48.679

FOR OTHER USE BUT WE'RE GONNA

02:39:55.819 --> 02:39:57.421
ACTUALLY JUST MAKE IT LOOK

02:39:57.487 --> 02:40:00.257
ILLEGAL TO ACTUALLY HAVE A LEGAL

02:40:00.324 --> 02:40:03.093
MARKET IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF

02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:06.530
THE STATE. HI AND THEN ON TOP OF

IT WE PUT HUGE TAXES ON THE

02:40:08.498 --> 02:40:10.534
LEGAL MARKET. AND WE CREATE A

02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:12.769
HUGE INCENTIVES FOR THE ILLICIT

02:40:12.836 --> 02:40:14.738
MARKET TO FLOURISH BECAUSE WE

02:40:14.805 --> 02:40:16.473
MAKE IT SO EXPENSIVE FOR

02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:18.241
LEGITIMATE OPERATORS TO OPERATE

02:40:18.308 --> 02:40:19.609
AND MAKE THE PRODUCT REALLY

02:40:19.676 --> 02:40:23.313
EXPENSIVE. SO WE SET UP A

02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:24.414
HORRIBLE SYSTEM THAT FUELS THE

02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:26.717

JUST TO BE UPSET ABOUT ILLEGAL

02:40:48.739 --> 02:40:51.108

THE PERSON ON THE STREET TO

IN CAUSING THE ILLEGAL GROW. AND

02:44:34.698 --> 02:44:36.166

02:45:28.251 --> 02:45:30.820
. AND BUT I AGREE WITH SENATOR

02:45:30.887 --> 02:45:33.890
WIENER. ANY COUNTY THAT SUPPORTS

02:45:33.957 --> 02:45:36.126
THIS BILL BETTER MAKE IT LEGALLY

02:45:36.192 --> 02:45:38.228
AVAILABLE TO BUY CANNABIS IN

02:45:38.295 --> 02:45:41.231
THEIR AREA BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR

02:45:41.298 --> 02:45:45.302
VERY OWN. LEGAL LAW HAS

02:45:45.368 --> 02:45:48.238
ENCOURAGED THE ILLICIT BUSINESS.

02:45:48.305 --> 02:45:50.240
AND IT IS FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT

02:45:50.307 --> 02:45:52.175
ARE PLAYING BY THE RULES THEY

02:45:52.242 --> 02:45:53.977
ARE BEING PUNISHED NOW THE

02:45:54.044 --> 02:45:56.446
ENTITIES THAT ARE OPERATING

02:45:56.513 --> 02:46:00.083
LEGAL GROWS. SO THIS IS WHY I AM

02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:01.751
WILLING TO MAKE THAT EXCEPTION

02:46:01.818 --> 02:46:03.353
I'M STILL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IN

02:46:03.420 --> 02:46:04.888
EFFECT YOU KNOW HAVING ANYBODY

02:46:04.954 --> 02:46:06.656
EVEN THOSE A WAFFLER GET A

02:46:06.723 --> 02:46:08.258
DOUBLE FELONY WHO IS JUST STATE

02:46:08.325 --> 02:46:12.028
REALLY MAKE A MINOR PARTICIPANT-

02:46:12.095 --> 02:46:13.630
AND- MAYBE I'M DOING A WILLING

02:46:13.697 --> 02:46:15.131
SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF THE

02:46:15.198 --> 02:46:18.568
HOPING THAT DA'S WOULD. RESHAPE

02:46:18.635 --> 02:46:20.770
THOSE CANISTER. AND NOT CHARGE

02:46:20.837 --> 02:46:24.174
THE FULL FELONY. ARMED AND YOU

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:25.141
KNOW WE COULD GO ON THE ROUTE

02:46:25.208 --> 02:46:28.178
OF. TRYING TO ADD JUST MORE-

02:46:28.244 --> 02:46:30.213
FEES CIVIL PENALTIES VERSUS A

02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:32.215
CRIME BUT HOWEVER AGAIN IF IT'S

02:46:32.282 --> 02:46:34.918
A FIT PLAYER THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:46:34.984 --> 02:46:36.619
MONEY TO PAY IT ANYWAY SO THIS

02:46:36.686 --> 02:46:39.589
IS ALL TRICKY. BUT IT IS THE

02:46:39.656 --> 02:46:42.525
CASE THAT THIS IS A LEGAL. DRUG

02:46:42.592 --> 02:46:44.994
AND WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE

02:46:45.061 --> 02:46:47.163
CAN TO DISCOURAGE ANYTHING THAT

02:46:47.230 --> 02:46:51.768
IS UNDERMINING THE LEGAL- OUR

02:46:51.835 --> 02:46:54.037
LEGAL MARKET PLACE. SO I WILL

02:46:54.104 --> 02:46:55.939
SUPPORT IT AND I REALLY

02:46:56.005 --> 02:46:58.508

BECAUSE- THAT IT IS A WOBBLER

02:47:09.786 --> 02:47:11.621
AND THAT THE THRESHOLD OF PLANTS

02:47:11.688 --> 02:47:16.192
IS GOING TO BE FIFTY OR ABOVE.

02:47:16.259 --> 02:47:18.261

BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE

02:47:24.701 --> 02:47:26.236
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS

02:47:26.302 --> 02:47:28.004
ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION.

02:47:28.071 --> 02:47:30.907
HOWEVER THIS WILL BE ABLE IT WAS

02:47:30.974 --> 02:47:32.509
JUST KEEP HAPPENING THESE GROWTH

02:47:32.575 --> 02:47:34.377
WILL JUST BE REPLACED BY NEW

02:47:34.444 --> 02:47:35.812
ILLEGAL GROWS UNTIL THE STATE OF

SURVIVORS RECOVER FROM THEIR

03:04:21.583 --> 03:04:24.153
TRAUMA AND BE ABLE TO HEAL FROM

03:04:24.219 --> 03:04:24.853
THE INJURIES THAT THEY'VE

03:04:24.920 --> 03:04:26.822
SUFFERED. I'VE WORKED ON THESE

03:04:26.889 --> 03:04:28.457
ISSUES AROUND HUMAN TRAFFICKING

03:04:28.524 --> 03:04:31.460
SINCE MY VERY FIRST CASE IN

03:04:31.527 --> 03:04:32.795
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. WHEN I

03:04:32.861 --> 03:04:34.930
HAD A THE VICTIM WAS IN TWELVE

03:04:34.997 --> 03:04:36.398
YEARS OLD. SHE WAS BEING

03:04:36.465 --> 03:04:38.167
TRAFFICKED BY A THIRTY NINE YEAR

03:04:38.233 --> 03:04:40.068
OLD MAN AND WHEN THE POLICE WERE

03:04:40.135 --> 03:04:42.704
ABLE TO INTERVENE AND RESCUE HER

03:04:42.771 --> 03:04:44.706
SHE WAS BEING RAPED BY A PERSON

03:04:44.773 --> 03:04:48.043
WHO PAID. TO RAPE HER WHO IS

03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:50.245
FIFTY YEARS OLD. I PROSECUTED

03:04:50.312 --> 03:04:51.413
BOTH THE TRAFFICKER AND THE

03:04:51.480 --> 03:04:53.582
PURCHASER BUT IN THOSE DAYS WE

03:04:53.649 --> 03:04:55.184
DID NOT HAVE A CRIME OF HUMAN

03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:56.652
TRAFFICKING WE DIDN'T HAVE A

03:04:56.718 --> 03:04:58.353
TERM CALLED HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

03:04:58.420 --> 03:05:00.355
SO IT'S BEEN MY EFFORTS EVER

03:05:00.422 --> 03:05:02.791
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN TO

03:05:02.858 --> 03:05:03.692
REALLY CHANGE THE PARADIGM OF

03:05:03.759 --> 03:05:05.861
CALIFORNIA AROUND HOW WE VIEW

03:05:05.928 --> 03:05:08.530
HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOW WE USE TO

03:05:08.597 --> 03:05:10.966
JUDGE SO HARSHLY VICTIMS AND

03:05:11.033 --> 03:05:13.602
BLAME THEM FOR THEIR SITUATION.

03:05:13.669 --> 03:05:16.205
AND HOW WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH IN

03:05:16.271 --> 03:05:18.173
OUR COMMUNITY AND TO OUR LAWS TO

03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:19.508
REALLY CHANGE THAT PARADIGM. I

03:05:19.575 --> 03:05:20.809
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WHEN WE

03:05:20.876 --> 03:05:22.744
TALK ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND

03:05:22.811 --> 03:05:24.613
FOR ME WHAT WE CALL HEAT WE'RE

03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:26.782
NOT TALKING ABOUT ADULT. PEOPLE

03:05:26.849 --> 03:05:28.317
WHO ARE ENGAGING IN COMMERCIAL

03:05:28.383 --> 03:05:29.585
SEX THAT'S A COMPLETELY

03:05:29.651 --> 03:05:32.287
DIFFERENT SITUATION FOR MOST

03:05:32.354 --> 03:05:34.089
THERE ARE ADULTS WHO HAVE BEEN

03:05:34.156 --> 03:05:36.225
TRAFFICKED SINCE CHILDHOOD. HAVE

03:05:36.291 --> 03:05:38.594
GROWN INTO CONTINUING THAT-

03:05:38.660 --> 03:05:40.896
COMMERCIAL SEX BUT WE'RE REALLY

03:05:40.963 --> 03:05:42.631
FOCUSING ON THOSE THAT ARE

03:05:42.698 --> 03:05:44.566
BEING. LURED INTO A TRAFFICKING

03:05:44.633 --> 03:05:46.001
ENVIRONMENT WHO ARE BEING HELD

03:05:46.068 --> 03:05:48.303
IN SLAVERY AND LET'S BE CLEAR

03:05:48.370 --> 03:05:50.772
HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS MODERN DAY

03:05:50.839 --> 03:05:53.242
SLAVERY. WE WORKED VERY HARD TO

03:05:53.308 --> 03:05:54.643
BRING ATTENTION TO HUMAN

03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:56.512
TRAFFICKING NOT ONLY IN

03:05:56.578 --> 03:05:57.746
CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THIS

03:05:57.813 --> 03:05:59.915
COUNTRY. EVERY STATE IN THE

03:05:59.982 --> 03:06:02.317
UNION HAS NOW IDENTIFIED HUMAN

03:06:02.384 --> 03:06:04.753
TRAFFICKING AS ONE OF THE MAJOR

03:06:04.820 --> 03:06:07.789
CRIMES IN THEIR STATE. WE HAVE

03:06:07.856 --> 03:06:09.858
WORKED VERY HARD ALSO TO BUILD A

03:06:09.925 --> 03:06:11.593
JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT RECOGNIZES

03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:13.762
THE DEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF

03:06:13.829 --> 03:06:15.797
HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE PHYSICAL

03:06:15.864 --> 03:06:20.002
ABUSE THAT GOES ON THAT IS SO- I

03:06:20.068 --> 03:06:21.770
MEAN THE THEY ARE ALL YOU CAN

03:06:21.837 --> 03:06:22.838
SAY IT'S THE MOST INHUMANE

03:06:22.905 --> 03:06:24.473
TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS OF

03:06:24.540 --> 03:06:26.608
HUMAN BEINGS. AND WE HAVE LOOKED

03:06:26.675 --> 03:06:28.677
AT THE NUMBER OF TRAFFICKED

03:06:28.744 --> 03:06:30.779
VICTIMS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED.

03:06:30.846 --> 03:06:32.614
SOME BY THE TRAFFICKER SOME BY

03:06:32.681 --> 03:06:35.551
THE PURCHASER. I ALSO WANT TO

03:06:35.617 --> 03:06:37.152
BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF THE

03:06:37.219 --> 03:06:38.487
COMMITTEE THE RESEARCH THAT'S

03:06:38.554 --> 03:06:41.323
BEING DONE NOT JUST AROUND HOW

03:06:41.390 --> 03:06:42.391
WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHAT THE

03:06:42.457 --> 03:06:44.026
IMPACT THE LIFELONG IMPACT FOR

03:06:44.092 --> 03:06:46.161
SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING

03:06:46.228 --> 03:06:48.330
BUT ALSO THE RESEARCH ON WHO IS

03:06:48.397 --> 03:06:50.132
THE TRAFFICKER WHAT'S IN THEIR

03:06:50.198 --> 03:06:51.934
PSYCHOLOGY. SO WE LOOK AT

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:53.235
RESEARCH FROM CANADA AND THE

03:06:53.302 --> 03:06:55.671
UNITED STATES THAT HAS FOCUSED

03:06:55.737 --> 03:06:57.673
ON TRAFFICKERS IN IN SHORT

03:06:57.739 --> 03:06:59.374
WASN'T WHAT IS EMERGING FROM

03:06:59.441 --> 03:07:02.144
THAT THOSE THAT RESEARCH IS THE

03:07:02.210 --> 03:07:04.179
HIGH INCIDENT OF PSYCHOPATHY.

03:07:04.246 --> 03:07:06.448
PSYCHOPATHY IS DEFINED AS A

03:07:06.515 --> 03:07:08.517
PERSON WHO HAS NO CONSCIENCE WHO

03:07:08.584 --> 03:07:10.519
HAS NO CARING FOR ANOTHER AND

03:07:10.586 --> 03:07:12.621
THAT IS CLEARLY WHAT TRAFFICKERS

03:07:12.688 --> 03:07:15.924
ARE THEY ARE SELLING INDIVIDUALS

03:07:15.991 --> 03:07:18.460
WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE IMPACT ON

03:07:18.527 --> 03:07:20.429
THEM. THE REAL RESEARCH ALSO

03:07:20.495 --> 03:07:22.898
ADDRESSES THE PREDATORY NATURE

03:07:22.965 --> 03:07:23.865
OF THE CRIME OF HUMAN

03:07:23.932 --> 03:07:25.934
TRAFFICKING. AND THE VIOLENCE IN

03:07:26.001 --> 03:07:28.337
UTTER DISREGARD FOR THE IMPACT

03:07:28.403 --> 03:07:30.439
ON THE VICTIM OF TRAFFICKING.

03:07:30.505 --> 03:07:31.740
AND THERE IS NEVER JUST ONE

03:07:31.807 --> 03:07:34.409
VICTIM BEING TRAFFICKED BY A

03:07:34.476 --> 03:07:36.878
TRAFFICKER. IT IS AT THE EIGHT

03:07:36.945 --> 03:07:38.513
TRAFFICKER WHO FITS IN THE

03:07:38.580 --> 03:07:39.948
CATEGORY IN THE RESEARCH THAT

03:07:40.015 --> 03:07:41.516
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SOMEONE

03:07:41.583 --> 03:07:43.051
WHO WILL CONTINUE TO LOWER

03:07:43.118 --> 03:07:46.054
CONTINUE TO RECRUIT CONTINUE TO

03:07:46.121 --> 03:07:47.856
PULL OTHER VICTIMS INTO THIS. IN

03:07:47.923 --> 03:07:49.791
MY OFFICE AS SENATOR GROSS SAID

03:07:49.858 --> 03:07:52.060
WE HAVE PROSECUTED OVER EIGHT

03:07:52.127 --> 03:07:53.895
HUNDRED CASES. THAT INVOLVES

03:07:53.962 --> 03:07:55.530
MORE THAN A THOUSAND VICTIMS OF

03:07:55.597 --> 03:07:57.532
SEX TRAFFICKING. RIGHT NOW WE

WAITING FOR COURT ROOM TO BRING

03:08:01.770 --> 03:08:04.039
JUSTICE TO THE VICTIMS AND TO

03:08:04.106 --> 03:08:05.107
HOLD THAT TRAFFICKERS

03:08:05.173 --> 03:08:06.908
ACCOUNTABLE. WE ALSO HAVE

03:08:06.975 --> 03:08:09.945
CREATED- HAVE DONE SEVEN

03:08:10.012 --> 03:08:11.813
THOUSAND SAFETY PLANS FOR YOUNG.

03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:13.148
VICTIMS WHO ARE VULNERABLE TO

03:08:13.215 --> 03:08:14.816
BEING TRAFFICKED OR HAVE BEEN

03:08:14.883 --> 03:08:17.719
TRAFFICKED AND EXPLOITED. THE

03:08:17.786 --> 03:08:19.788
END OF THE AND NOW I JUST WANT

03:08:19.855 --> 03:08:20.822
TO ADDRESS ONE THING IN THE

03:08:20.889 --> 03:08:22.758
ANALYSIS AND THAT TALKS ABOUT

03:08:22.824 --> 03:08:25.160
THE STORY OF RENE. WHO HERSELF

03:08:25.227 --> 03:08:27.829
WAS TRAFFICKED BUT THEN I BECAME

03:08:27.896 --> 03:08:32.167
A RECRUITER IF YOU WILL. I WANT

03:08:32.234 --> 03:08:34.136
TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT

03:08:34.202 --> 03:08:35.937
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

03:08:36.004 --> 03:08:37.439
YOUR THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED

03:08:37.506 --> 03:08:40.108
SEVERAL LAWS THAT REALLY PROTECT

03:08:40.175 --> 03:08:42.544
AND REQUIRE US WE DO IT ANYWAY

03:08:42.611 --> 03:08:44.513
THAT IT REQUIRES US TO LOOK AT

03:08:44.579 --> 03:08:46.481
THE- HISTORY OF AN INDIVIDUAL

03:08:46.548 --> 03:08:48.050
WHO GETS CAUGHT UP AS A

03:08:48.116 --> 03:08:50.018
PERPETRATOR OF CRIME AND I PUT

03:08:50.085 --> 03:08:51.787
THAT IN QUOTES. AND THAT WE ARE

03:08:51.853 --> 03:08:54.222
NOW REQUIRED TO LOOK AT WHETHER

03:08:54.289 --> 03:08:55.323
OR NOT THAT PARTICULAR

03:08:55.390 --> 03:08:56.591
INDIVIDUAL WAS THE VICTIM OF

03:08:56.658 --> 03:08:57.959
HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE EARLIER

03:08:58.026 --> 03:09:01.063
YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE BUILT YOU

03:09:01.129 --> 03:09:03.732
HAVE BUILT STRONG LAWS FOR VAGUE

03:09:03.799 --> 03:09:05.567
TO VACATING OLD CONVICTIONS OF

03:09:05.634 --> 03:09:06.835
SOMEBODY WHO WAS ACTUALLY BEING

03:09:06.902 --> 03:09:08.970
TRAFFICKED. WHAT WAS PROSECUTED

03:09:09.037 --> 03:09:10.939
AS A PERPETRATOR SO WE'RE

03:09:11.006 --> 03:09:12.674
BUILDING IT YOU ARE BUILDING IN

03:09:12.741 --> 03:09:15.110
THE PROTECTIONS BUT THE TIME IS

03:09:15.177 --> 03:09:16.411
NOW FOR CALIFORNIA TO REALLY

SUPPORT AND I WILL SAY IT WAS A

03:54:39.231 --> 03:54:43.602
LOT OF REFERENCE TO LGBTQ YOUTH-

03:54:43.669 --> 03:54:46.205
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT A MINUTE-

03:54:46.272 --> 03:54:51.444
YES MY COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW

03:54:51.510 --> 03:54:52.111
DESERVED IN MY COMMUNITY. PEOPLE

03:54:52.178 --> 03:54:53.746
WHO. YOU KNOW I WAS A I'LL BE

03:54:53.813 --> 03:54:55.981
CAN I WAS LUCKY THAT I HAD

03:54:56.048 --> 03:54:56.882
PARENTS WHO SUPPORTED ME AND

03:54:56.949 --> 03:54:59.585
LOVED ME. AND LET ME HAVE A ROOF

03:54:59.652 --> 03:55:01.487
OVER MY HEAD. BECAUSE SO MANY

03:55:01.554 --> 03:55:04.056
MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY. YOU'RE

03:55:04.123 --> 03:55:06.225
KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOUSES OF

03:55:06.292 --> 03:55:07.359
OUR HOMES THEIR PARENTS REJECT

03:55:07.426 --> 03:55:09.428
THEM. BECAUSE THEY COME OUT

03:55:09.495 --> 03:55:11.397
COULD BE A TWELVE THIRTEEN

03:55:11.464 --> 03:55:13.232
FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND THEY ARE

03:55:13.299 --> 03:55:14.233
ON THE STREET IT'S NOT A

03:55:14.300 --> 03:55:15.134
COINCIDENCE THAT ALMOST ABOUT

03:55:15.201 --> 03:55:17.403
HALF. OF HOMELESS YOUTH ARE

03:55:17.470 --> 03:55:20.606
LGBTQ HALF 50% OF HOMELESS YOUTH

03:55:20.673 --> 03:55:23.642
ARE LGBTQ THAT'S NOT RANDOM

03:55:23.709 --> 03:55:24.577
THAT'S BECAUSE THESE CHILDREN

03:55:24.643 --> 03:55:25.978
ARE GETTING REJECTED FROM THEIR

03:55:26.045 --> 03:55:26.946
FAMILIES REJECTED FROM THEIR

03:55:27.012 --> 03:55:29.181
COMMUNITIES AND THEY END UP ON

03:55:29.248 --> 03:55:32.318
THE STREETS. AND IT IS NOT

03:55:32.384 --> 03:55:33.619
SHOCKING. THAT SOME OF THEM ARE

03:55:33.686 --> 03:55:35.421
GETTING TRAFFICKED THEY'RE SO

03:55:35.488 --> 03:55:38.123
VULNERABLE BECAUSE SOCIETY

03:55:38.190 --> 03:55:39.291
REJECTS THEM BECAUSE OUR

03:55:39.358 --> 03:55:43.028
FAMILIES REJECT THEM. AND WE SEE

03:55:43.095 --> 03:55:44.330
DESPICABLE POLITICIANS.

03:55:44.396 --> 03:55:46.465
DESPICABLE POLITICIANS PEOPLE

03:55:46.532 --> 03:55:47.967
LIKE GREG ABBOTT AND RHONDA

03:55:48.033 --> 03:55:51.070
SANTOS AND ALL THESE PEOPLE. WHO

03:55:51.136 --> 03:55:55.007
ON THE BACKS. OF LGBTQ KIDS ARE

03:55:55.074 --> 03:55:56.809
TRYING TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS

03:55:56.876 --> 03:55:58.377
TO BECOME PRESIDENT OR SENATOR

03:55:58.444 --> 03:56:00.579
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO BE. AND

03:56:00.646 --> 03:56:03.315
WHEN THEY DO THAT MORE OF THESE

03:56:03.382 --> 03:56:05.317
KIDS END UP ON THE STREETS. AND

03:56:05.384 --> 03:56:07.119
MORE THESE KIDS END UP

03:56:07.186 --> 03:56:07.987
TRAFFICKED AND THEY'RE NOT BEING

03:56:08.053 --> 03:56:10.456
TRAFFICKED BECAUSE THE SENTENCE

03:56:10.523 --> 03:56:12.324
ISN'T HARSH ENOUGH THEY'RE NOT

03:56:12.391 --> 03:56:14.293
BEING TRAFFIC BECAUSE IT'S NOT A

03:56:14.360 --> 03:56:16.128
STRIKE BECAUSE THE PERSON'S ONLY

03:56:16.195 --> 03:56:18.130
GETTING TWELVE OR TWENTY YEARS.

03:56:18.197 --> 03:56:20.165
IN PRISON INSTEAD OF LIFE IN

03:56:20.232 --> 03:56:22.601
PRISON THEY'RE GETTING TRAFFIC

03:56:22.668 --> 03:56:23.802
BECAUSE WHAT SOCIETY HAS DONE TO

03:56:23.869 --> 03:56:26.639
THEM. AND I CAN GO THROUGH OTHER

03:56:26.705 --> 03:56:28.440
COMMUNITIES. BETTER TREATED LIKE

03:56:28.507 --> 03:56:30.509
GARBAGE IN THE SOCIETY. AND WHEN

03:56:30.576 --> 03:56:32.945
WE LOOK AT WHO'S GETTING

03:56:33.012 --> 03:56:34.647
TRAFFICKED IN THIS SOCIETY.

03:56:34.713 --> 03:56:38.050
DISPROPORTIONATELY IT'S. IT'S

03:56:38.117 --> 03:56:40.853
NOT PEOPLE WITH MY BACKGROUND.

03:56:40.920 --> 03:56:42.955
I'M NOT SAYING IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

03:56:43.022 --> 03:56:45.024
IT DOES CAN HAPPEN TO A LOT OF

03:56:45.090 --> 03:56:45.791
PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN

03:56:45.858 --> 03:56:48.060
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING VERY

03:56:48.127 --> 03:56:49.895
DISPROPORTIONATELY SUBJECTED TO

03:56:49.962 --> 03:56:51.997
HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND IT'S NOT

03:56:52.064 --> 03:56:55.034
BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING A

03:56:55.100 --> 03:56:56.235
STRIKE OR GOING TO PRISON FOR

03:56:56.302 --> 03:56:57.870
LIFE. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAY

03:56:57.937 --> 03:56:59.972
THAT THIS SOCIETY TREATS CERTAIN

03:57:00.039 --> 03:57:01.340
COMMUNITIES AND TREATS THE

03:57:01.407 --> 03:57:03.509
CHILDREN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

03:57:03.576 --> 03:57:05.644
AND THEY END UP VULNERABLE ON

03:57:05.711 --> 03:57:07.680
THE STREET. IN FOSTER CARE

03:57:07.746 --> 03:57:09.815
DUMPED OUT OF FOSTER CARE AND

03:57:09.882 --> 03:57:12.051
THEY END UP BEING TRAFFICKED- SO

03:57:12.117 --> 03:57:14.954
LET'S FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE

03:57:15.020 --> 03:57:16.555
SURVIVORS LET'S SUPPORT THESE

03:57:16.622 --> 03:57:18.757
KIDS BEFORE. THEY END UP IN

03:57:18.824 --> 03:57:20.793
OPPOSITION. BUT PASSING THIS

03:57:20.859 --> 03:57:22.861
BILL TODAY IN MY PERSONAL VIEW

03:57:22.928 --> 03:57:24.997
IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THIS IS

03:57:25.064 --> 03:57:26.532
NOT GOING TO HELP. US THOSE

03:57:26.599 --> 03:57:30.169
SURVIVORS WITH ALL RESPECT AND

03:57:30.235 --> 03:57:31.437
SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

03:57:31.503 --> 03:57:33.606
THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU

03:57:33.672 --> 03:57:40.913
SENATOR WIENER. SENATOR SKINNER. WHICH I CAN CONTINUE. THE

03:57:40.980 --> 03:57:43.916
FIRST. SINCE YOU'VE BEEN

03:57:43.983 --> 03:57:45.851
PRESIDING OVER THIS ENTIRE BILL

03:57:45.918 --> 03:57:49.021
LET YOU KEEP THE MIKE AND- I WAS

03:57:49.088 --> 03:57:50.990
ABLE TO HEAR SOME OF THE

03:57:51.056 --> 03:57:52.591
TESTIMONY BUT UNFORTUNATELY I

03:57:52.658 --> 03:57:55.961
WAS- HAVING TO PRESENT A BUILD

03:57:56.028 --> 03:57:56.962
ANOTHER COMMITTEE WHICH HAPPENS

03:57:57.029 --> 03:57:59.732
ON. IN THE JUGGLING OF THE

03:57:59.798 --> 03:58:01.834
CIRCUMSTANCES AND I WAS ABLE TO

03:58:01.900 --> 03:58:05.771
MEET- THE KEY WITNESS AT. BOTH

03:58:05.838 --> 03:58:08.407
WITNESSES AND IN ADVANCE OF THE

03:58:08.474 --> 03:58:15.214
HEARING. OUR. I IN NO WAY

03:58:15.280 --> 03:58:17.149
MINIMIZE THE CRIME OF HUMAN

03:58:17.216 --> 03:58:20.219
TRAFFICKING. IT IS A SERIOUS

03:58:20.285 --> 03:58:24.156
CRIME. HOWEVER WHEN WE USE THE

03:58:24.223 --> 03:58:27.593
EXAMPLE OF THAT IF SOMEONE

03:58:27.660 --> 03:58:30.496
COMMITS A ROBBERY THAT THEY CAN

03:58:30.562 --> 03:58:32.031
GET A THIRD STRIKE AND IN THIS

03:58:32.097 --> 03:58:34.700
CASE SOMEONE CAN'T I THINK AS

03:58:34.767 --> 03:58:36.935
SENATOR WIENER EXPLAINED IT

03:58:37.002 --> 03:58:38.637
DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT

03:58:38.704 --> 03:58:41.640
IT IS NOT JUST A FLAT OUT THAT

03:58:41.707 --> 03:58:45.911
THEY CANNOT- NOW I PERSONALLY

03:58:45.978 --> 03:58:48.280
DON'T AGREE THAT ROBBERY SHOULD

03:58:48.347 --> 03:58:50.282
HAVE A THIRD STRIKE I THINK

03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:54.086
CERTAIN TYPES OF- ROBBERY MAY.

03:58:54.153 --> 03:58:55.354
BE SHOULD BE ELEVATED BUT NOT

03:58:55.421 --> 03:58:59.525
ALL AND OUR THIRD STRIKE LAW HAS

03:58:59.591 --> 03:59:01.894
NOT BENEFITED CALIFORNIANS OR

03:59:01.960 --> 03:59:10.069
PUBLIC SAFETY. ON. THE OTHER

03:59:10.135 --> 03:59:12.871
LOOK SENTENCING WE CAN ALWAYS

03:59:12.938 --> 03:59:14.673
DEBATE WHETHER OUR SENTENCING

03:59:14.740 --> 03:59:18.343
PRACTICES ARE ADEQUATE BUT- WHEN

03:59:18.410 --> 03:59:21.580
I LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS AND THERE

03:59:21.647 --> 03:59:24.750
IS DIFFERENT CATEGORIES

03:59:24.817 --> 03:59:25.684
OBVIOUSLY THE PERSON COULD BE

03:59:25.751 --> 03:59:27.786
CHARGED OF ONE OF WHICH WOULD

03:59:27.853 --> 03:59:29.755
GIVE EIGHT FOURTEEN OR TWENTY

03:59:29.822 --> 03:59:31.857
YEARS AND OF COURSE IF THEY HAVE

03:59:31.924 --> 03:59:34.960
ADDITIONAL. CRIMES THAT THEY'RE

03:59:35.027 --> 03:59:36.929
CHARGED THAT CAN ADD OTHER TIME

03:59:36.995 --> 03:59:40.065
OR VERY SEVENTIES ALSO KERRY

03:59:40.132 --> 03:59:42.868
ENHANCEMENTS SO I DON'T THINK IT

03:59:42.935 --> 03:59:46.338
IS ACCURATE OR FAIR TO DESCRIBE

03:59:46.405 --> 03:59:48.907
THAT OUR SENTENCING LAWS WOULD

03:59:48.974 --> 03:59:51.744
ONLY ALLOW FOR A HUMAN

03:59:51.810 --> 03:59:55.748
TRAFFICKERS TO SERVE SAY TWELVE

03:59:55.814 --> 04:00:03.122
YEARS. ON. THIS IS EX EXTREMELY

04:00:03.188 --> 04:00:05.324
EMOTIONAL SUBJECT AND-

04:00:05.390 --> 04:00:07.659
LEGITIMATELY BECAUSE THOSE WHO

04:00:07.726 --> 04:00:09.261
ARE TRAFFICKED THEIR LIVES ARE

04:00:09.328 --> 04:00:19.138
SO TORN APART THE TRAUMA IS. IT

04:00:19.204 --> 04:00:21.073
MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO BE HEALED

04:00:21.140 --> 04:00:24.977
FROM. BUT OUR CHANGING CERTAIN

04:00:25.043 --> 04:00:26.145
PARTS OF THE LAW TO A THIRD

04:00:26.211 --> 04:00:28.814
STRIKE IS NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE

04:00:28.881 --> 04:00:32.351
THAT. AND SO I AM UNABLE TO

04:00:32.417 --> 04:00:33.519
SUPPORT THE BILL IS STRUCTURED

04:00:33.585 --> 04:00:44.797
TODAY. YES AND THE LAST ONE.

04:00:44.863 --> 04:00:46.365
WITH OUR DUE RESPECT DON'T MAKE

04:00:46.431 --> 04:00:51.503
ME CRY HEY. FIRST OF ALL TO

04:00:51.570 --> 04:00:53.705
SENATOR WIENER'S POINT ABOUT HIS

04:00:53.772 --> 04:00:59.578
COMMUNITY. I JUST WANT YOU TO

04:00:59.645 --> 04:01:07.252
KNOW THAT- MANY OF US. SEE YOUR

04:01:07.319 --> 04:01:09.321
CHILDREN NO MATTER WHERE THEY

04:01:09.388 --> 04:01:13.325
ARE. IN THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION

04:01:13.392 --> 04:01:16.628
AS PRECIOUS. PRECIOUS LITTLE

04:01:16.695 --> 04:01:18.964
BEANS ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OF FAITH

04:01:19.031 --> 04:01:22.267
LIKE MY- AND THE FACT THAT MANY

04:01:22.334 --> 04:01:24.002
OF THEM GO HOMELESS OR KICKED

04:01:24.069 --> 04:01:25.604
OUT OF THEIR HOME IS ONE OF THE

04:01:25.671 --> 04:01:26.905
REASONS WHY I SUPPORT EVERYTHING

04:01:26.972 --> 04:01:29.074
THAT I CAN FOR FOSTER YOUTH. AND

04:01:29.141 --> 04:01:31.343
KIDS I DON'T THINK ANY CHILD

04:01:31.410 --> 04:01:32.778
SHOULD BE KICKED OUT OF THEIR

04:01:32.845 --> 04:01:35.047
HOME. AND AS A MATTER OF FACT

04:01:35.113 --> 04:01:36.315
WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT HUMAN

04:01:36.381 --> 04:01:37.916
TRAFFICKING R. SEVERAL YEARS

04:01:37.983 --> 04:01:40.652
BACK AND BECAME AWARE THANKS TO

04:01:40.719 --> 04:01:43.121
DR OPAL SINGLETON AND THE

04:01:43.188 --> 04:01:44.923
RESEARCH AND THE WORK THAT SHE

04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:46.391
HAS DONE IN THIS FIELD. I

04:01:46.458 --> 04:01:48.293
ACTUALLY WENT BACK HOME AND I

04:01:48.360 --> 04:01:49.728
SHARED IT WITH MY KIDS AT THE

04:01:49.795 --> 04:01:52.764
TIME I HAD A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD.

04:01:52.831 --> 04:01:55.367
DAUGHTER AND- SHARE WITH HER

04:01:55.434 --> 04:01:57.269
HEALTH PEOPLE ARE GROOMED AND-

04:01:57.336 --> 04:02:00.472
RIDE INTO THIS SPACE. AND MY

04:02:00.539 --> 04:02:02.474
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD SAID MOM. WE

04:02:02.541 --> 04:02:04.243
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS WE SHOULD

04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:06.778
ALL LEARN HIS THEY NEED TO TELL

04:02:06.845 --> 04:02:09.815
EVERYBODY SHE BECAME DESPERATE.

04:02:09.882 --> 04:02:10.983
FOR HER FRIENDS AND SCHOOLMATES

04:02:11.049 --> 04:02:13.852
TO LEARN ABOUT IT. AS THE FIERCE

04:02:13.919 --> 04:02:17.289
MAMA BEAR. EVERY HILD PRECIOUS

04:02:17.356 --> 04:02:22.561
AND PROTECTED. WHEN IT COMES TO

04:02:22.628 --> 04:02:24.897
THIS BILL. I WANT TO ADDRESS THE

04:02:24.963 --> 04:02:27.799
FACT THAT I UNDERSTAND HIS ONCE

04:02:27.866 --> 04:02:32.738
AGAIN I WISH I HAD MORE DEPTH.

04:02:32.804 --> 04:02:36.441
BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR. LET YOU

04:02:36.508 --> 04:02:37.542
FOLKS HAVE EXPRESSED THE FACT

04:02:37.609 --> 04:02:39.244
THAT THEY ARE. OTHER CRIMES THAT

04:02:39.311 --> 04:02:40.979
ARE CONSIDERED SERIOUS FELONIES

04:02:41.046 --> 04:02:42.748
YOU EXPLAIN THAT TODAY EARLIER

04:02:42.814 --> 04:02:44.950
IN YOUR TESTIMONY. IT ALSO

04:02:45.017 --> 04:02:47.486
EXPRESSED THE EIGHT FOURTEEN AND

04:02:47.552 --> 04:02:49.821
TWENTY YEARS BUT ONE THING THAT

04:02:49.888 --> 04:02:51.657
. WAS NOTED EARLIER TODAY IS THE

04:02:51.723 --> 04:02:55.294
FACT THAT. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

04:02:55.360 --> 04:03:00.065
ARE SENTENCED BUT FOR X. Y. NZ

04:03:00.132 --> 04:03:02.434
REASONS ARE RELEASED. AND GO

04:03:02.501 --> 04:03:05.737
BACK AND COMMIT THE CRIME AGAIN

04:03:05.804 --> 04:03:07.706
. AND IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER

04:03:07.773 --> 04:03:10.442
AGAIN AND I THINK THAT IS WHY WE

04:03:10.509 --> 04:03:13.512
HAVE. HELLO THERE IS AN INTENT

04:03:13.578 --> 04:03:16.048
OR IT BASICALLY AN INTENT OR

04:03:16.114 --> 04:03:18.116
DESIRE TO MAKE THIS A THREE

04:03:18.183 --> 04:03:21.219
STRIKES ARE PART OF THE THREE

04:03:21.286 --> 04:03:23.588
STRIKES- COMPONENT OR ELEMENT IS

04:03:23.655 --> 04:03:26.825
BECAUSE WE WANT TO CURB. THOSE

04:03:26.892 --> 04:03:28.727
THAT ARE PERPETRATORS CONTINUES

04:03:28.794 --> 04:03:31.296
PERPETRATORS FROM BEING ABLE TO

04:03:31.363 --> 04:03:34.900
USE THE SYSTEM. AND BASICALLY

04:03:34.967 --> 04:03:37.769
INFLICT HARM ON CHILDREN FULL OF

04:03:37.836 --> 04:03:44.009
COLOR WOMEN AND EVEN MEN. I

UNDERSTAND BUT I WOULD LOVE TO

04:03:57.389 --> 04:04:00.359
THAT WERE EXPRESSED.

04:04:00.425 --> 04:04:03.128
RESERVATIONS THAT- THE CRIMINAL

MIND ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

04:04:20.345 --> 04:04:21.480
ISSUES WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR

04:04:21.546 --> 04:04:23.548
NOT. THEY ARE SEEN THE VICTIMS

04:04:23.615 --> 04:04:24.983
ARE SEEN AND WHETHER OR NOT

04:04:25.050 --> 04:04:27.519
THEY'RE PROTECTED IF THEY ARE

04:04:27.586 --> 04:04:32.357
ARRESTED- IN THIS SPACE. WHEN

04:04:32.424 --> 04:04:34.593
SOME OF THE FIRST OF ALL I JUST

04:04:34.659 --> 04:04:36.028
WANNA THIS IS BEEN VERY VERY

04:04:36.094 --> 04:04:38.797
EMOTIONAL BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING

04:04:38.864 --> 04:04:40.966
HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE THREE

04:04:41.033 --> 04:04:42.868
SENATORS BY SENATOR BREAUX

04:04:42.934 --> 04:04:45.537
SENATOR CAFIERO SO- AND ALL THE

04:04:45.604 --> 04:04:48.640
SPEAKERS. WHAT WHAT WE HAVE

04:04:48.707 --> 04:04:50.208
CHANGED SO MUCH OVER THE LAST

04:04:50.275 --> 04:04:51.777
SEVERAL YEARS WHEN I STARTED IN

04:04:51.843 --> 04:04:54.413
THIS AS I SAID IN NINETEEN

04:04:54.479 --> 04:04:56.348
NINETY SEVEN. THERE WAS NOTHING.

04:04:56.415 --> 04:04:58.016
OTHER THAN FOR SOMEONE WHO IS

04:04:58.083 --> 04:05:00.585
UNDER FOURTEEN AND WE COULD

04:05:00.652 --> 04:05:02.054
TREAT IT LIKE CHILD MOLEST. WE

04:05:02.120 --> 04:05:03.655
HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH WE HAVE

04:05:03.722 --> 04:05:05.590
DONE SO MUCH BUT ONE OF THE

04:05:05.657 --> 04:05:07.492
THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED. IS THAT

04:05:07.559 --> 04:05:08.827
FIRST OF ALL THAT THERE ARE

04:05:08.894 --> 04:05:10.862
PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMIZED. WHO

04:05:10.929 --> 04:05:13.165
THEN CAN FIND THEMSELVES

04:05:13.231 --> 04:05:15.267
INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

04:05:15.333 --> 04:05:17.502
PART OF WHAT OUR LAW DOES NOW IS

04:05:17.569 --> 04:05:20.238
IT. NOT JUST ALLOWS PEOPLE LIKE

04:05:20.305 --> 04:05:21.740
ME AND OTHER PROSECUTORS LAW

04:05:21.807 --> 04:05:24.109
ENFORCEMENT TO LOOK AT PEOPLE'S

04:05:24.176 --> 04:05:26.611
BACKGROUND. AND MOTIVATION AND

04:05:26.678 --> 04:05:28.980
PARTICULARLY THEIR VICTIMIZATION

04:05:29.047 --> 04:05:31.116
THAT PUT THEM IN A PATH OF.

04:05:31.183 --> 04:05:32.684
BEING EITHER EIGHT USED BY A

04:05:32.751 --> 04:05:34.920
TRAFFICKER TO COMMIT CRIMES OR

04:05:34.986 --> 04:05:37.355
TO. FOR THEIR LIFE SAVING TO

04:05:37.422 --> 04:05:38.924
ENGAGE AND SOMETHING LIKE A

04:05:38.990 --> 04:05:41.226
RECRUITING OR SOMETHING. I THINK

04:05:41.293 --> 04:05:43.862
THAT. WE ARE VERY COGNIZANT OF

04:05:43.929 --> 04:05:45.997
THE IMPACT OF TRAFFICKING WE'VE

04:05:46.064 --> 04:05:48.233
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ALL DAY

04:05:48.300 --> 04:05:50.869
. THAT LEADS PEOPLE TO A PLACE

04:05:50.936 --> 04:05:51.937
WHERE THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE DO

04:05:52.003 --> 04:05:55.707
IT. BUT WE DO HAVE LAWS WE DO

04:05:55.774 --> 04:05:57.809
HAVE THERE'S A LEGAL DEFENSE IF

04:05:57.876 --> 04:05:59.978
SOMEBODY IS ACCUSED OF A CRIME A

04:06:00.045 --> 04:06:04.516
pBE USED AT TRIAL DEPENDING ON

04:06:04.583 --> 04:06:06.952
THE CRIME. WELL IT IT'S

04:06:07.018 --> 04:06:09.020
AVAILABLE- AND THAT'S THAT

04:06:09.087 --> 04:06:10.956
BECOME SOMETHING FOR A JURY TO

04:06:11.022 --> 04:06:12.491
DECIDE SO I THINK IT ALSO

04:06:12.557 --> 04:06:14.059
DEPENDS ON THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT

04:06:14.126 --> 04:06:15.794
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IN MY

04:06:15.861 --> 04:06:17.729
COUNTY AND MANY COUNTIES THAT

04:06:17.796 --> 04:06:19.631
HAVE BROUGHT FORTH HUMAN

04:06:19.698 --> 04:06:22.400
TRAFFICKING EXPERTS TO SIT IN

04:06:22.467 --> 04:06:25.103
THE CHAIR THAT I SIT IN. THAT

04:06:25.170 --> 04:06:26.071
ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE LOOKING

04:06:26.138 --> 04:06:28.907
AT IS WHAT IS THE WHAT HOW IS IT

04:06:28.974 --> 04:06:30.442
THAT A PERSON WHO WAS ONCE

04:06:30.509 --> 04:06:32.544
TRAFFIC OR IS ENGAGING IN SOME

04:06:32.611 --> 04:06:34.513
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR WHAT IS THE

04:06:34.579 --> 04:06:37.149
ROOT OF THAT. THE SAME ANALYSIS

04:06:37.215 --> 04:06:39.050
WERE DOING FOR VICTIMS WE'RE

04:06:39.117 --> 04:06:40.085
DOING FOR PEOPLE WHO GET CAUGHT

04:06:40.152 --> 04:06:42.988
UP IN CRIME. AND IF IN FACT THE

04:06:43.054 --> 04:06:45.957
ROOT OF THEIR CONDUCT. IS

04:06:46.024 --> 04:06:47.626
BECAUSE THEY WERE TRAFFICKED AND

04:06:47.692 --> 04:06:49.694
THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSE AND

04:06:49.761 --> 04:06:51.229
IMPACT OF THAT TRAFFICKING

04:06:51.296 --> 04:06:53.064
EXPERIENCE NOW PUTS THEM IN A

04:06:53.131 --> 04:06:55.200
DIFFERENT POSITION. THAN THAT IS

04:06:55.267 --> 04:06:58.537
TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION FOR

04:06:58.603 --> 04:07:00.005
PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND AND- MATT

04:07:00.071 --> 04:07:01.773
AND HANDLE CASES INVOLVING HUMAN

04:07:01.840 --> 04:07:03.341
TRAFFICKING BUT IF SOMEBODY WAS

04:07:03.408 --> 04:07:05.744
CONVICTED. THERE ARE VACANT YOUR

04:07:05.810 --> 04:07:07.746
LAWS WHICH WE HEARD ABOUT FROM A

04:07:07.812 --> 04:07:09.948
MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION. WE'RE

04:07:10.015 --> 04:07:12.617
VERY ACTIVE ACROSS THE STATE

04:07:12.684 --> 04:07:13.919
THERE ARE VACANT YOUR LAWS THERE

04:07:13.985 --> 04:07:15.420
ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

04:07:15.487 --> 04:07:16.388
BRINGING THESE CASES TO OUR

04:07:16.454 --> 04:07:18.089
ATTENTION. WE OURSELVES IN

04:07:18.156 --> 04:07:19.891
PROSECUTORS OFFICES ARE LOOKING

04:07:19.958 --> 04:07:22.727
AT COLD CASES TO SEE WHETHER OR

04:07:22.794 --> 04:07:25.330
NOT. THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED

04:07:25.397 --> 04:07:26.965
WHILE SOMEONE IS BEING

04:07:27.032 --> 04:07:27.933
TRAFFICKED OR AS A RESULT OF

04:07:27.999 --> 04:07:29.568
BEING TRAFFICKED. THERE ARE

04:07:29.634 --> 04:07:31.069
THERE'S RE SENTENCING LAWS THAT

04:07:31.136 --> 04:07:33.038
YOUR LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED

04:07:33.104 --> 04:07:35.073
THAT HAS ALLOWED US. MEANING

04:07:35.140 --> 04:07:37.876
PROSECUTORS AND TO GO BACK AND

04:07:37.943 --> 04:07:39.578
PULL CASES BACK INTO THE COURT

04:07:39.644 --> 04:07:41.413
TO SAY THIS SENTENCE IS NOT

04:07:41.479 --> 04:07:43.181
WARRANTED WAS NOT WARRANTED WE

04:07:43.248 --> 04:07:45.217
CAN RE SENTENCE PEOPLE. AND THEN

04:07:45.283 --> 04:07:47.852
LASTLY BUT YOU KNOW WE WHEN

04:07:47.919 --> 04:07:49.087
THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE CHALLENGES

04:07:49.154 --> 04:07:51.523
THERE ALSO THE COMMUTATION LAWS

04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:53.258
THAT HAVE BECOME. MUCH MORE

04:07:53.325 --> 04:07:54.926
AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

04:07:54.993 --> 04:07:58.296
BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES THROUGH

04:07:58.363 --> 04:08:00.131
GOVERNOR IS BEEN. VERY

04:08:00.198 --> 04:08:03.034
RESPONSIVE. TO HEARING AND

04:08:03.101 --> 04:08:04.169
READING ABOUT SOMEBODY'S

04:08:04.236 --> 04:08:05.704
BACKGROUND THAT LED TO

04:08:05.770 --> 04:08:08.173
CONVICTION SO. I WOULD SAY THAT

04:08:08.240 --> 04:08:09.941
PART OF IT IS BRINGING IT FOR

04:08:10.008 --> 04:08:11.309
BRINGING THESE OLD CONVICTIONS

04:08:11.376 --> 04:08:13.678
IN THESE OLD CIRCUMSTANCES FORD

04:08:13.745 --> 04:08:15.614
AND THE LAW HAS GIVEN US YOUR-

04:08:15.680 --> 04:08:16.848
TO YOUR CREATION. THE LAW HAS

04:08:16.915 --> 04:08:19.618
GIVEN US SEVERAL VEHICLES FOR.

04:08:19.684 --> 04:08:20.952
BEING ABLE TO SET ASIDE

04:08:21.019 --> 04:08:22.954
CONVICTIONS OR BEING ABLE TO

04:08:23.021 --> 04:08:24.389
RESEND SOME SOMEONE IF THEY'RE

04:08:24.456 --> 04:08:25.624
STILL INCARCERATED AND BRING

04:08:25.690 --> 04:08:27.659
THEM BACK. THERE ARE JUST SO

04:08:27.726 --> 04:08:29.160
MANY AREAS AND PARTICULARLY ONE

04:08:29.227 --> 04:08:30.462
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE THE

04:08:30.528 --> 04:08:32.364
VACANT YOUR LAWS FOR PEOPLE WHO

04:08:32.430 --> 04:08:34.165
ARE CONVICTED OF CRIMES. WHEN

04:08:34.232 --> 04:08:35.333
IT'S DETERMINED THAT WHEN THEY

04:08:35.400 --> 04:08:36.568
COMMITTED THAT CRIME THEY WERE

04:08:36.635 --> 04:08:37.869
VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

04:08:37.936 --> 04:08:39.537
THAT'S THE BASIS OF THE BAKER

04:08:39.604 --> 04:08:41.706
LAWS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN

04:08:41.773 --> 04:08:43.575
TRAFFICKED. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS

04:08:43.642 --> 04:08:47.612
YOUR QUESTION IT SAYS IT DOES.

04:08:47.679 --> 04:08:49.247
AND THEN LASTLY THERE WAS

04:08:49.314 --> 04:08:51.750
ANOTHER. UP FOR THE RECORD WOULD

04:08:51.816 --> 04:08:54.819
YOU MIND- BECAUSE I KNOW ARE MY

04:08:54.886 --> 04:08:56.321
COLLEAGUES ARE VERY VERY FOCUSED

04:08:56.388 --> 04:08:59.291
ON RESEARCH AND DATA- IN ORDER

04:08:59.357 --> 04:09:01.092
TO SUPPORT POLICY COULD YOU

04:09:01.159 --> 04:09:02.861
EXPLAIN THE RESEARCH IN THE DATA

04:09:02.927 --> 04:09:04.863
THAT YOU ARE COMING ACROSS WITH

04:09:04.929 --> 04:09:06.631
REGARDS TO NOT NECESSARY THAT

04:09:06.698 --> 04:09:10.302
PART- THE VICTIMS WHO HAD BEEN-

04:09:10.368 --> 04:09:12.337
COMPELLED TO COME INTO THIS INTO

04:09:12.404 --> 04:09:14.572
THIS HUMAN TRAFFICKING SPACE BUT

04:09:14.639 --> 04:09:16.508
MORE SO THROUGH THE PERPETRATORS

04:09:16.574 --> 04:09:18.710
AND SPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO.

04:09:18.777 --> 04:09:20.378
THOSE WHO ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS

04:09:20.445 --> 04:09:23.815
THAT CONTINUOUSLY COME BACK AND-

04:09:23.882 --> 04:09:25.684
COMMIT THIS CRIME. WELL THERE IS

04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:28.153
A LOT OF RESEARCH. AND MORE

04:09:28.219 --> 04:09:29.421
EMERGING RESEARCH IN THIS

04:09:29.487 --> 04:09:30.822
PARTICULAR AREA TRYING TO FIGURE

04:09:30.889 --> 04:09:32.724
OUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A PERSON

04:09:32.791 --> 04:09:35.193
WHO'S A HUMAN TRAFFICKER SO THAT

04:09:35.260 --> 04:09:36.728
IS DIFFERENT IN THAT WHEN WE

04:09:36.795 --> 04:09:38.630
FIRST STARTED SEEING HUMAN

04:09:38.697 --> 04:09:39.764
TRAFFICKING EMERGING WE ARE

04:09:39.831 --> 04:09:41.800
SEEING- PEOPLE THAT WERE

04:09:41.866 --> 04:09:43.635
SWITCHING FROM SELLING DRUGS TO

04:09:43.702 --> 04:09:45.770
SELLING PEOPLE. YOU KNOW IT

04:09:45.837 --> 04:09:47.138
WASN'T THE SAME MENTALITY BUT

04:09:47.205 --> 04:09:48.707
WHAT WE DO AND THE RESEARCH IS

04:09:48.773 --> 04:09:50.742
NOT SHOWING US IS THAT THERE'S A

04:09:50.809 --> 04:09:53.445
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PSYCHOPATHY

04:09:53.511 --> 04:09:54.979
IN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HUMAN

04:09:55.046 --> 04:09:57.349
TRAFFICKERS THE ONES WHO ARE

04:09:57.415 --> 04:09:59.951
HAVE NO HUMAN EMOTION AND

04:10:00.018 --> 04:10:01.219
REGARDS TO THE INDIVIDUAL

04:10:01.286 --> 04:10:03.688
THEY'RE THEY'RE SELLING. THE ONE

04:10:03.755 --> 04:10:05.557
WHO IS USING VIOLENCE SOMETIMES

04:10:05.623 --> 04:10:08.827
TO FORCE THEM TO DO TO ENGAGE IN

04:10:08.893 --> 04:10:11.229
THAT SEXUAL ACTIVITY SO THERE'S

04:10:11.296 --> 04:10:14.666
A HIGH DEGREE OF PSYCHOPATHY AND

04:10:14.733 --> 04:10:16.000
THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING. FROM

04:10:16.067 --> 04:10:18.069
A PSYCHOLOGICAL STANDPOINT

04:10:18.136 --> 04:10:19.604
BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OF

04:10:19.671 --> 04:10:20.939
INDIVIDUALS IN OUR SOCIETY

04:10:21.005 --> 04:10:22.707
ACCORDING TO RESEARCH OF PEOPLE

04:10:22.774 --> 04:10:24.743
WHO ARE TRUE PSYCHO PASS OR

04:10:24.809 --> 04:10:27.312
HAVE. THAT PSYCHOPATHY IS PRETTY

04:10:27.379 --> 04:10:29.714
SMALL BUT IN THE WORLD OF HUMAN

04:10:29.781 --> 04:10:31.015
TRAFFICKERS AT LEAST WITH THE

04:10:31.082 --> 04:10:33.551
RESEARCH IS STARTING TO SHOW US

04:10:33.618 --> 04:10:34.018
IN THE WORLD OF HUMAN

04:10:34.085 --> 04:10:36.121
TRAFFICKERS THAT. PERCENTAGE OF

04:10:36.187 --> 04:10:37.655
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CYCLE

04:10:37.722 --> 04:10:40.125
PASTOR HAVE PSYCHOPATHY AS PART

04:10:40.191 --> 04:10:42.494
OF THEIR MAKE UP IS HIGH. AND

04:10:42.560 --> 04:10:44.062
THAT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE

04:10:44.129 --> 04:10:46.231
IF A PERSON'S WIRING IF YOU WILL

04:10:46.297 --> 04:10:48.533
MENTAL WIRING IS SUCH THAT THEY

04:10:48.600 --> 04:10:50.468
DON'T HAVE HUMAN EMPATHY AND

04:10:50.535 --> 04:10:52.270
THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT

04:10:52.337 --> 04:10:54.172
KIND OF CARING THAT WE ARE ALL

04:10:54.239 --> 04:10:57.041
EXPRESSING HERE- THEN. THERE'S

04:10:57.108 --> 04:11:00.412
NO- THERE'S NO INCENTIVE OR

04:11:00.478 --> 04:11:04.149
THERE'S NO SOCIAL OF PRESSURE TO

04:11:04.215 --> 04:11:05.817
ACT DIFFERENTLY. WHAT THE

04:11:05.884 --> 04:11:07.886
RESEARCH IS ALSO SHOWING US IS

04:11:07.952 --> 04:11:10.054
THAT FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. AND

04:11:10.121 --> 04:11:11.222
THESE ARE ADULTS HUMAN

04:11:11.289 --> 04:11:12.657
TRAFFICKERS AND I'M FOLK THAT WE

04:11:12.724 --> 04:11:14.225
FOCUS ON THAT THERE'S A

04:11:14.292 --> 04:11:16.194
PREDATORY NATURE OF THE CRIME

04:11:16.261 --> 04:11:18.196
THERE THE RESEARCH SAYS THAT

04:11:18.263 --> 04:11:20.331
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO

04:11:20.398 --> 04:11:22.400
LOWER INTO A TRAFFICKING. OR

04:11:22.467 --> 04:11:24.235
INTO MODERN DAY SO CAN YOU MAKE

04:11:24.302 --> 04:11:26.204
THAT SPECIFIC TO THE I THINK THE

04:11:26.271 --> 04:11:28.239
DATA THIS IS RESEARCH BUT HOW

04:11:28.306 --> 04:11:30.275
DOES THAT RELATE TO THE- THE

04:11:30.341 --> 04:11:32.811
QUESTION OF THERE. THE

04:11:32.877 --> 04:11:33.912
SENTENCING AND THE REPEAT

04:11:33.978 --> 04:11:36.281
OFFENSE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

04:11:36.347 --> 04:11:36.981
DESCRIBE IS THEIR DATA THAT

04:11:37.048 --> 04:11:38.716
SHOWS THAT. WELL THERE'S NOT

04:11:38.783 --> 04:11:41.119
DATE IN TERMS OF SENTENCING BUT

04:11:41.186 --> 04:11:42.754
THEIR STATE IN TERMS OF THE MAKE

04:11:42.821 --> 04:11:44.856
UP OF AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT SO.

04:11:44.923 --> 04:11:47.225
BUT SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE

04:11:47.292 --> 04:11:48.526
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT NOW

04:11:48.593 --> 04:11:51.429
IS HOW WOULD THAT DATA JUSTIFY.

04:11:51.496 --> 04:11:52.864
ON THE NEED FOR- THREE STRIKES

04:11:52.931 --> 04:11:54.999
ARE HAVING HUMAN TRAFFICKING BE

04:11:55.066 --> 04:11:57.635
PART AS A SEARS AND FELONY. TO

04:11:57.702 --> 04:11:59.604
BE CHARGED AS A THREE STRIKES I

04:11:59.671 --> 04:12:01.806
THINK THAT'S OR YES SO THANK YOU

04:12:01.873 --> 04:12:04.876
I'M I APOLOGIZE I WASN'T SO

04:12:04.943 --> 04:12:06.945
FOCUSED ON THAT. THE THREE

04:12:07.011 --> 04:12:09.280
STRIKES LAW. ANALYSTS SAY A

04:12:09.347 --> 04:12:11.683
STRIKE I MEAN A STRIKE IF YOU

04:12:11.749 --> 04:12:15.487
WILL. I IS IT REALLY FOCUSED ON

04:12:15.553 --> 04:12:17.355
PEOPLE WHO ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS.

04:12:17.422 --> 04:12:19.190
SO IF SOMEBODY COMMITS A STRIKE

04:12:19.257 --> 04:12:21.159
CRIMEI WON'T USE ROBBERY

04:12:21.226 --> 04:12:22.694
BECAUSE I AGREE ON SOME LEVEL

04:12:22.760 --> 04:12:24.529
WITH SENATOR SKINNER. BUT AND

04:12:24.596 --> 04:12:27.499
IT'S A SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONY.

04:12:27.565 --> 04:12:31.769
AND THEY ARE INCARCERATED AND

04:12:31.836 --> 04:12:32.971
THEY COME OUT AND THEY NEVER

04:12:33.037 --> 04:12:33.938
COMMIT ANOTHER CRIME. THEN THE

04:12:34.005 --> 04:12:35.907
THREE STRIKES LAW REALLY DOESN'T

04:12:35.974 --> 04:12:37.141
IMPACT THEM DIRECTLY IN TERMS OF

04:12:37.208 --> 04:12:39.644
CAUSING A GREATER SENTENCE IT IS

04:12:39.711 --> 04:12:41.880
THE SENTENCE THAT THE PENAL

04:12:41.946 --> 04:12:44.382
CODE. ALLOCATE WHERE WHERE I

04:12:44.449 --> 04:12:46.184
BELIEVE THIS RESEARCH WILL LEAD

04:12:46.251 --> 04:12:48.987
US TO IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO HAS

04:12:49.053 --> 04:12:51.890
HAS SITE HAS THE PSYCHOPATHY AND

04:12:51.956 --> 04:12:54.726
SOMEBODY WHO. DOESN'T HAVE OR IS

04:12:54.792 --> 04:12:56.628
A PREDATOR IN THERE AS THEIR

04:12:56.694 --> 04:12:59.297
NATURE OR HAS DISREGARD FOR THE

04:12:59.364 --> 04:13:01.099
IMPACT OF THE CRIME THERE'S NO

04:13:01.165 --> 04:13:03.535
PSYCHOLOGICAL INCENTIVE NOT TO

04:13:03.601 --> 04:13:06.037
CONTINUE THAT BEHAVIOR. SO THREE

04:13:06.104 --> 04:13:08.139
STRIKES IS REALLY ABOUT. CAN

04:13:08.206 --> 04:13:09.841
CONTINUE TO COMMIT CRIMES AFTER

04:13:09.908 --> 04:13:12.310
YOU'VE BEEN COMMITTED CONVICTED

04:13:12.377 --> 04:13:14.279
OF A CRIME AND- THE RESEARCH IS

04:13:14.345 --> 04:13:16.781
NOT SO SPECIFIC TO SAY HOW DOES

04:13:16.848 --> 04:13:18.883
THIS PSYCHOPATHY. FIT INTO

04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:21.619
SENTENCING BUT I WOULD ARGUE

04:13:21.686 --> 04:13:23.054
THAT THE IF SOMEBODY IS A

04:13:23.121 --> 04:13:24.656
PREDATOR AND THEY AREN'T BOUND

04:13:24.722 --> 04:13:26.858
BY THE RULES OF SOCIETY AND THEY

04:13:26.925 --> 04:13:27.759
HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF

04:13:27.825 --> 04:13:29.561
PSYCHOPATHY AND PREDATORY NATURE

04:13:29.627 --> 04:13:32.564
THAT THERE'S- NOTHING TO STOP

04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:33.731
THEM ONCE THEY'RE BACK OUT IN

04:13:33.798 --> 04:13:35.733

CLEAR TO MISCREANTS AND THAT

04:14:18.276 --> 04:14:18.876
THIS BILL TEN FORTY TWO DOES NOT

04:14:18.943 --> 04:14:20.612

THAT BALLOT MEASURE WAS PASSED

04:14:43.334 --> 04:14:44.535
INDIVIDUALS LIKE MISS GRACE AND

04:14:44.602 --> 04:14:46.871
WERE ARRESTED AND NOT TREATED AS

04:14:46.938 --> 04:14:49.874
VICTIMS. AND NOW THEY ARE THAT

04:14:49.941 --> 04:14:52.176
MR GRAYSON WAS SENTENCED PRIOR

04:14:52.243 --> 04:14:52.677
TO THAT AND THAT'S MY

04:14:52.744 --> 04:14:54.812

IT'S EVIDENCE IN STUDIES THAT

THE HIGHEST BIDDER. AT TODAY

04:17:37.308 --> 04:17:38.776

A A LIST OF THINGS WERE NOT

04:18:01.732 --> 04:18:03.534
CONSIDERED SERIOUS AND VIOLENT

04:18:03.601 --> 04:18:06.804
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I

04:18:06.871 --> 04:18:08.606
WAS ACTUALLY THINKING OF SMASH

04:18:08.673 --> 04:18:11.642

THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE

04:18:19.350 --> 04:18:20.785
BUYING AND SELLING OF A HUMAN

04:18:20.852 --> 04:18:23.287

04:18:23.354 --> 04:18:24.989
OR VIOLENT. THE MIUTE LAB READ

FELONY IN A STRIKING AGAIN I'M

PRISON HAND THEY GET PICTURES

04:18:48.312 --> 04:18:49.614
OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR IN A TIME

04:18:49.680 --> 04:18:51.816
AND DAY SERVED IN ALL THE THINGS

04:18:51.883 --> 04:18:54.218
THAT WE ALLOW. AND THEY GET BACK

04:18:54.285 --> 04:18:56.020
OUT ON THE STREET AND THEY RE

04:18:56.087 --> 04:18:59.657
OFFEND. AS A TRAFFICKER. IF THIS

04:18:59.724 --> 04:19:01.592
BILL WAS TO PASS. THEY COULD

04:19:01.659 --> 04:19:03.261
HAVE A STRIKE AND THEY WOULD

04:19:03.327 --> 04:19:06.063

IS A CONDITION OF A HUMAN BEING

04:19:55.279 --> 04:19:57.515
BEING OWNED BY ANOTHER SLAVE WAS

04:19:57.581 --> 04:19:59.216

BRANDED TO PROVE OWNERSHIP.

04:20:36.153 --> 04:20:38.422

04:20:46.530 --> 04:20:48.099
THE CURRENT VICTIMS AND

04:20:48.165 --> 04:20:48.933
SURVIVORS OF THIS GROTESQUE

04:20:49.000 --> 04:20:50.735
CRIME BUT ESPECIALLY THE

04:20:50.801 --> 04:20:52.069
TRAFFICKERS THEMSELVES THAT THEY

04:20:52.136 --> 04:20:53.771
DON'T NEED TO TAKE THIS CRIME

04:20:53.838 --> 04:20:55.639
SERIOUS AND IT'S NOT SERIOUS

04:20:55.706 --> 04:20:58.376
ENOUGH TO BE CONSIDERED A STRIKE

04:20:58.442 --> 04:21:00.978
. THE VOTE NO I DO BELIEVE THAT

04:21:01.045 --> 04:21:04.115
I THINK YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOUR-

04:21:04.181 --> 04:21:05.116

04:21:10.221 --> 04:21:12.757
VIOLENT FELONY. I URGE YOU TO

04:21:12.823 --> 04:21:14.025

04:21:16.293 --> 04:21:17.261
EXPERTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS

04:21:17.328 --> 04:21:20.431
ISSUE. BUT I THINK THE ANALYSIS

04:21:20.498 --> 04:21:22.600
HAD A LOT OF ERRORS IN IT. AND I

04:21:22.666 --> 04:21:24.001
THINK THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND

04:21:24.068 --> 04:21:26.103
THAT PROSECUTE THESE CRIMES THAT

04:21:26.170 --> 04:21:28.339
NEED THE TOOLS IN THEIR TOOLBOX

TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE

04:21:30.307 --> 04:21:32.109

04:21:48.259 --> 04:21:49.226
SHE WATCHED HER DAUGHTER GET

04:21:49.293 --> 04:21:52.496
BEATEN. AND THERE'S GOTTA BE

04:21:52.563 --> 04:21:54.432
HARSHER PENALTIES FOR PEOPLE WHO

04:21:54.498 --> 04:21:56.667
WOULD BE WILLING TO PERPETRATE

04:21:56.734 --> 04:21:58.936
THAT AGAINST ANOTHER HUMAN BEING

04:21:59.003 --> 04:22:01.072
. I TOLD MY ALL MY WITNESSES AND

04:22:01.138 --> 04:22:02.673
EVERYBODY THAT CALLED IN ON THE

BIPARTISAN BILL. AND WE NEED

04:22:18.089 --> 04:22:20.357
THREE VOTES TO CONTINUE THE

04:22:20.424 --> 04:22:21.325

. WE WILL TAKE A VOTE. CENTER

04:22:47.918 --> 04:22:51.455

COMMITTEE TO SERVE ON. THE

04:22:54.091 --> 04:22:56.961
THINGS THAT COME BEFORE US. THE

04:22:57.027 --> 04:22:59.964
EXPERIENCES OF VICTIMS AND THIS

04:23:00.030 --> 04:23:01.899
ONE OF THIS PARTICULAR CRIME THE

04:23:01.966 --> 04:23:03.834
EXPERIENCES OF VICTIMS. I MEAN I

04:23:03.901 --> 04:23:07.338

HAD WE'VE HAD YEARS WHERE.

04:23:19.150 --> 04:23:21.085
PROSECUTORS AND OUR LAW

04:23:21.152 --> 04:23:23.387
ENFORCEMENT WOULD NOT TREAT RAPE

04:23:23.454 --> 04:23:25.789
SERIOUSLY WE HAD REVENUE FOR

04:23:25.856 --> 04:23:29.226
YEARS JUST IGNORED AND SIT ON

04:23:29.293 --> 04:23:31.729
SHELVES. AND IF I DON'T NEED TO

04:23:31.795 --> 04:23:33.230
GO INTO GREAT DETAIL BUT THE

04:23:33.297 --> 04:23:39.003
TYPES OF. STORIES EXPERIENCES I

04:23:39.069 --> 04:23:40.337
DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE

04:23:40.404 --> 04:23:41.205
STORIES BUT THE PERSONAL

04:23:41.272 --> 04:23:43.440
EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE THAT COME

04:23:43.507 --> 04:23:44.475
TO THIS COMMITTEE EITHER THAT

04:23:44.542 --> 04:23:46.410
THERE THEY WERE THEMSELVES THE

04:23:46.477 --> 04:23:48.145
VICTIM OF A HORRIFIC CRIME OR

04:23:48.212 --> 04:23:50.481
THEY HAD A CHILD OR A MURDER

04:23:50.548 --> 04:23:52.850
RAPE HUMAN TRAFFICKING YOUR NAME

04:23:52.917 --> 04:23:56.420
IS IT IS THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST

04:23:56.487 --> 04:23:59.623
EMOTIONALLY TOILING COMMIT. AND

04:23:59.690 --> 04:24:02.359
OUR LAWS ARE NOT PERFECT BY ANY

04:24:02.426 --> 04:24:08.232
MEANS. AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY

04:24:08.299 --> 04:24:10.000
PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE A WHOLE

04:24:10.067 --> 04:24:11.368
DIFFERENT SYSTEM OF EVALUATING A

04:24:11.435 --> 04:24:13.437
CRIMINAL ON THE ON THE FROM THE

04:24:13.504 --> 04:24:15.673
POINT OF VIEW OF THEIR- IF THEY

04:24:15.739 --> 04:24:20.144
ARE SOCIAL PATH. AND- WHAT. WE

04:24:20.211 --> 04:24:21.845
WOULD PROBABLY FIND THERE'S A

04:24:21.912 --> 04:24:23.247
NUMBER OF CATEGORIES OF CRIMES

04:24:23.314 --> 04:24:25.182
THAT PROBABLY ATTRACT SOCIOPATHS

04:24:25.249 --> 04:24:27.785
MORE THAN OTHERS. AND YET WE

04:24:27.851 --> 04:24:30.120
DON'T HAVE A SENSING SYSTEM THAT

04:24:30.187 --> 04:24:32.723
TRIES TO IDENTIFY THAT. SO WE

04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:35.025
ARE TRYING NOW TO DEVELOPERS WE

04:24:35.092 --> 04:24:36.894
ARE TRYING NOW TO DEAL WITH THE

04:24:36.961 --> 04:24:38.195
CREW- THE EXISTING SENSING

04:24:38.262 --> 04:24:39.797
SYSTEM WITH THE TOOLS THAT ARE

04:24:39.863 --> 04:24:42.600
BEFORE US. AND CLEARLY YOU HAVE

04:24:42.666 --> 04:24:46.237
MADE A VERY- VERY PASSIONATE

04:24:46.303 --> 04:24:50.474
ARTICULATE. AND ONE. SOMETHING

04:24:50.541 --> 04:24:52.543
THAT MANY PEOPLE COULD SUPPORT

04:24:52.610 --> 04:24:53.844
AS TO WHY WE SHOULD MAKE THIS

04:24:53.911 --> 04:24:57.314
CHANGE. AS YOU HEARD IN I DO NOT

04:24:57.381 --> 04:24:59.016
NEED TO SAY THIS IN ANY WAY TO

04:24:59.083 --> 04:25:01.518
RUB IT IN FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT

04:25:01.585 --> 04:25:02.686
GOING TO APPRECIATE THAT THIS

04:25:02.753 --> 04:25:04.822
BILL MAY NOT. BE SUPPORTED TODAY

04:25:04.888 --> 04:25:07.658
. THAT I FEEL THAT WE HAVE MORE

04:25:07.725 --> 04:25:10.728
BIT MORE. LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT

04:25:10.794 --> 04:25:12.463
CAN BE USED AGAINST THESE

04:25:12.529 --> 04:25:15.399
PERPETRATORS. AND WE HAVE TO IN

04:25:15.466 --> 04:25:17.768
THIS COMMITTEE WAY THE FULL

04:25:17.835 --> 04:25:20.971
AMOUNT OF. OF TOOLS THAT A

04:25:21.038 --> 04:25:22.640
PROSECUTOR HAS EVEN WON THE

04:25:22.706 --> 04:25:23.941
PROSECUTORS DON'T FEEL THEY'RE

04:25:24.008 --> 04:25:25.576
ADEQUATE OR INDIVIDUAL

04:25:25.643 --> 04:25:27.544
PROSECUTORS DON'T END THERE OF

04:25:27.611 --> 04:25:29.280

04:25:29.346 --> 04:25:31.515
THAT'S WHAT OUR ANALYSIS THAT'S

04:25:31.582 --> 04:25:33.517
WHAT OUR KID STAFF IN THE

04:25:33.584 --> 04:25:34.918
COMMITTEE ARE TRYING TO DO WHEN

04:25:34.985 --> 04:25:36.820
THEY PROVIDE THAT ANALYSIS TO US

04:25:36.887 --> 04:25:38.522

EMERGENCY HAVE LASTED LONGER

04:39:50.673 --> 04:39:51.774

IMPLICATIONS LONGER THAN A YEAR

04:39:59.315 --> 04:40:00.950
IF WE TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRE

04:40:01.017 --> 04:40:03.186

04:40:03.253 --> 04:40:05.355
MORE THAN A YEAR. BEFORE MANY OF

THE PEOPLE DISPLACED. WERE ABLE

04:40:08.091 --> 04:40:10.260
TO GET- THEIR HOUSING REPLACED

04:40:10.326 --> 04:40:12.729
AND IF HOUSING WAS AVAILABLE.

04:40:12.795 --> 04:40:14.697
FOR THOSE WHO DID YOU KNOW WHO

04:40:14.764 --> 04:40:17.300
HAD LOST THEIR- HOMES AND WE'RE

04:40:17.367 --> 04:40:18.801

04:40:21.137 --> 04:40:22.405
KIND OF PROTECTION FOR THAT

04:40:22.472 --> 04:40:24.707

04:40:24.774 --> 04:40:27.143

THREAT HOW THAT IS HANDLED-

05:06:23.298 --> 05:06:25.400
GIVEN COVE IT AND THE FACT THAT

05:06:25.467 --> 05:06:26.534

THAT THEY MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND

05:06:44.385 --> 05:06:46.888
HOW TO SHARE IN A WAY THAT IS

05:06:46.955 --> 05:06:50.125
HEALTHY FOR THEM- AND DO WE LEAN

05:06:50.191 --> 05:06:52.227

05:07:44.279 --> 05:07:48.817
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR. AND I

05:07:48.883 --> 05:07:50.985
THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN WITH

05:07:51.052 --> 05:07:53.254
THE BILL PROCESS IS THAT. IT'S

05:07:53.321 --> 05:07:54.389
ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

05:07:54.455 --> 05:07:55.890
AUTHOR TO LEARN WHAT IS

05:07:55.957 --> 05:07:57.826
IMPORTANT TO- HIS OR HER

05:07:57.892 --> 05:08:01.296
COLLEAGUES. AND IF IT MEANS THAT

05:08:01.362 --> 05:08:02.831
HE WOULD MEET WITH THE APPROVAL

05:08:02.897 --> 05:08:05.266
OF THIS BOARD AND CONTINUE THIS-

05:08:05.333 --> 05:08:06.835
THIS COMMITTEE A MOVE THIS

05:08:06.901 --> 05:08:08.369
PROCESS ALONG. I COULD

05:08:08.436 --> 05:08:11.472
ABSOLUTELY I AGREE THAT WE WOULD

05:08:11.539 --> 05:08:14.309
CONVERT IT FOR MINORS TO BE

05:08:14.375 --> 05:08:16.110
MISDEMEANORS I IF THAT WAS ONE

05:08:16.177 --> 05:08:17.545
DISTINCTION THAT WAS EVENTUALLY

05:08:17.612 --> 05:08:18.580
ACHIEVED WITH THE PREVIOUS

05:08:18.646 --> 05:08:20.381
AUTHOR. BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE

05:08:20.448 --> 05:08:23.117
ARE THERE ARE ISSUES WHEN YOU'RE

05:08:23.184 --> 05:08:24.419
DEALING WITH MINORS. BUT LET'S

05:08:24.485 --> 05:08:25.854
ALSO NOT FORGET THE FACT THAT

05:08:25.920 --> 05:08:27.689
THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES.

05:08:27.755 --> 05:08:29.924
ARE WITH THE IMPACT TO THE

05:08:29.991 --> 05:08:32.160
COMMUNITY TO THE SCHOOL ARE TO

05:08:32.227 --> 05:08:33.962
THE MOSQUE TO THE TEMPLE TO THE

05:08:34.028 --> 05:08:37.866
CHURCH. WINDIES THREATS OCCUR.

05:08:37.932 --> 05:08:40.235
ODD WHICH IS WHY WE HEARD FROM

05:08:40.301 --> 05:08:44.105
THE- FROM THE PROSECUTORS THAT

05:08:44.172 --> 05:08:48.443
THIS IS APPROPRIATELY- A FALSE

05:08:48.509 --> 05:08:50.879
REPORT UNDER ONE FORTY EIGHT

05:08:50.945 --> 05:08:53.314
WHICH IS WHY IT WAS PUT. IN ONE

05:08:53.381 --> 05:08:55.016
FORTY EIGHT AS OPPOSED TO FOUR

05:08:55.083 --> 05:08:58.353
TWENTY TWO. BUT IN TERMS OF- OF

05:08:58.419 --> 05:09:00.021
LOOKING AFTER INDIVIDUALS THAT

05:09:00.088 --> 05:09:03.391
MAYBE HAVE- DISABILITIES OR WHO

05:09:03.458 --> 05:09:05.260
HAVE NOT FULLY APPRECIATED THEM

05:09:05.326 --> 05:09:07.128
RAMIFICATIONS OF THEIR HANDS OF

05:09:07.195 --> 05:09:09.731
THEIR ACTIONS. A MISDEMEANOR OR

05:09:09.797 --> 05:09:11.733
DO YOU THE POTENTIAL FOR THE

05:09:11.799 --> 05:09:13.801
APPLICATION OF A MISDEMEANOR

05:09:13.868 --> 05:09:15.236
CHARGE. I OPENS THE DOOR

05:09:15.303 --> 05:09:17.238
CERTAINLY FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND

05:09:17.305 --> 05:09:19.407
SOCIAL SERVICES TO GET INVOLVED.

05:09:19.474 --> 05:09:20.942
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT ALL IT

05:09:21.009 --> 05:09:23.978
TAKES IS A THREAT AND THEY CAN

05:09:24.045 --> 05:09:26.714
CLOSE DOWN AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY

05:09:26.781 --> 05:09:28.316
IT CAN CLOSE DOWN AN ENTIRE

05:09:28.383 --> 05:09:31.319
SCHOOL THERE HAS TO BE A SENSE

05:09:31.386 --> 05:09:34.188
OF. BALANCE THAT LOOKS AFTER THE

05:09:34.255 --> 05:09:35.723
INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO

05:09:35.790 --> 05:09:37.492
IS ALLEGED TO HAVE PERPETRATED

05:09:37.558 --> 05:09:40.161
THE THREAT. AS WELL AS THE WHOLE

05:09:40.228 --> 05:09:41.629
UPON WHICH THAT PERSON IS ACTING

05:09:41.696 --> 05:09:43.698
IN AFFECTING AND THAT'S WHAT I

05:09:43.765 --> 05:09:46.100
THINK THIS BILL DOES IS THAT IF

05:09:46.167 --> 05:09:47.602
IT MEETS WITH YOUR APPROVAL AND

05:09:47.669 --> 05:09:50.605

NINETEEN AS IT PASSED

05:09:51.306 --> 05:09:52.040
UNANIMOUSLY THROUGH THIS

05:09:52.106 --> 05:09:54.075
COMMITTEE BEFORE. THAT IF WE

05:09:54.142 --> 05:09:56.811

05:09:56.878 --> 05:09:58.813
UNDER TO MISDEMEANORS. THEN I

05:09:58.880 --> 05:10:00.214
WOULD ABSOLUTELY GIVE YOU MINE

05:10:00.281 --> 05:10:02.216
MY WORDS THAT IS HOW IT WILL BE

05:10:02.283 --> 05:10:05.687
REDRAFTED ONCE IS MOVED TO THE

05:10:05.753 --> 05:10:17.465

IN A FALSE THREAT AND SHUTS DOWN

05:10:43.024 --> 05:10:45.526
THE SCHOOL IT'S EXTREMELY

05:10:45.593 --> 05:10:49.297

BUT IN YOU KNOW- THE INSTANCE

05:11:22.697 --> 05:11:24.632
THAT I'M SPECIFICALLY REFERRING

TO THERE WERE RAMIFICATIONS FOR

05:11:26.401 --> 05:11:28.069
THAT PARTICULAR STUDENT. THAT

05:11:28.136 --> 05:11:29.203
BIRD THAT CHILD WAS IMMEDIATELY

05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:31.472
EXPELLED THEY HAD RAMIFICATIONS

05:11:31.539 --> 05:11:32.974
WITH THE PARENTS IT IMPACTED

05:11:33.041 --> 05:11:34.742
THEIR ABILITY TO GO TO ANOTHER

05:11:34.809 --> 05:11:38.846
pIMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES- AND IT

05:11:38.913 --> 05:11:40.915
WAS THE END NOTHING HAPPENS THEY

05:11:40.982 --> 05:11:43.251
DID NOT ENACT THEY DID NOT GO

05:11:43.317 --> 05:11:44.352
THROUGH WITH THE THINGS THAT

05:11:44.419 --> 05:11:46.654
THEY WERE SAYING. EIGHT AND

05:11:46.721 --> 05:11:49.023
TRUTHFULLY. THE NEXT WEEK

05:11:49.090 --> 05:11:50.958
SOMEBODY ELSE DID SOMETHING THAT

05:11:51.025 --> 05:11:54.095
WAS EQUALLY SORT OF. USEFUL AND

05:11:54.162 --> 05:11:57.165
WILD AND THAT BECAME VERY OLD

05:11:57.231 --> 05:11:59.133
NEWS THE RESILIENCY OF YOUNG

05:11:59.200 --> 05:12:01.769
PEOPLE IS EQUALLY ASTONISHING

05:12:01.836 --> 05:12:03.438
BUT I WILL SAY IN THIS

05:12:03.504 --> 05:12:06.007
PARTICULAR INSTANCE- AND THE

05:12:06.074 --> 05:12:07.975
THING THAT HAPPENED. WAS NOT

05:12:08.042 --> 05:12:09.777
NICE SO I'M CERTAINLY NOT TRYING

05:12:09.844 --> 05:12:12.346
TO PLACATE OR OR GLOSS OVER BUT

05:12:12.413 --> 05:12:13.714
THERE WERE IMMEDIATE AND SEVERE

05:12:13.781 --> 05:12:15.383
RAMIFICATIONS FOR BOTH THE

05:12:15.450 --> 05:12:17.051
PARENT AND THE CHILD THAT ARE

05:12:17.118 --> 05:12:18.986
STILL FELT TO THIS DAY BY THAT

05:12:19.053 --> 05:12:21.789
PARTICULAR FAMILY I DO THINK

05:12:21.856 --> 05:12:23.891
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GO ABOUT

05:12:23.958 --> 05:12:25.993
. TRYING TO CREATE THE KIND OF

05:12:26.060 --> 05:12:27.728
SAFETY AND CONSEQUENTIAL

05:12:27.795 --> 05:12:28.963
EXPERIENCE THAT WE'RE ALL

05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:31.732
LOOKING FOR- I SIR AND I DON'T

05:12:31.799 --> 05:12:34.168
ALWAYS KNOW IF USING THE WEAPON

05:12:34.235 --> 05:12:35.636
OR THE TOOL THAT IS THE CRIMINAL

05:12:35.703 --> 05:12:38.106
LEGAL SYSTEM IS APPROPRIATE

05:12:38.172 --> 05:12:44.979
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG KIDS. HE

05:12:45.046 --> 05:12:47.615
WAS VERY CLOSE MADAM CHAIR ARM I

05:12:47.682 --> 05:12:49.217
WILL SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER

05:12:49.283 --> 05:12:50.685
COMMENT OTHERWISE THEY WILL

05:12:50.751 --> 05:12:57.058
ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE. OKAY GREAT.

05:12:57.125 --> 05:13:01.162
THE SECOND WITNESS THAT- APPEAR

05:13:01.229 --> 05:13:03.631
TELEPHONICALLY IN OPPOSITION.

05:13:03.698 --> 05:13:06.200
IDENTIFIED ON THE LIST OF EVENTS

05:13:06.267 --> 05:13:11.439
THAT. THIS IS A BILL LIKE THIS

05:13:11.506 --> 05:13:15.943
WOULD TARGET CASUAL CONVERSATION. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM

05:13:16.010 --> 05:13:18.613
THE TRUTH. I THINK WE ALL KNOW

05:13:18.679 --> 05:13:20.615
HIS SPECIALLY IN OUR DIGITAL ERA

05:13:20.681 --> 05:13:22.683
AND SOME OF US PREDATE THAT SO

05:13:22.750 --> 05:13:25.419
HE CAN CLEARLY. MYSELF INCLUDED

05:13:25.486 --> 05:13:27.054
CLEARLY DISTINGUISH WHAT THINGS

05:13:27.121 --> 05:13:29.824
WERE LIKE PRIOR TO SOCIAL MEDIA

05:13:29.891 --> 05:13:31.526
AND- EVERYBODY HAVING A

05:13:31.592 --> 05:13:33.728
SOPHISTICATED CELL PHONE. THIS

05:13:33.794 --> 05:13:35.062
ISNOT APPLYING TO CASUAL

05:13:35.129 --> 05:13:37.265
CONVERSATION FOLKS. WE'RE

05:13:37.331 --> 05:13:39.467
TALKINGABOUT THREATS. THAT

05:13:39.534 --> 05:13:41.302
COULD BE LEVIED AGAINST A

05:13:41.369 --> 05:13:44.539
TEMPLE. IN THE CONTEXT OF

05:13:44.605 --> 05:13:47.008
EXTRAORDINARY ANTI SEMITISM. TO

05:13:47.074 --> 05:13:48.342
WHICH MEMBERS OF THE

05:13:48.409 --> 05:13:50.044
CONGREGATION AND LEADERSHIP OF

05:13:50.111 --> 05:13:52.113
THAT COMIC CONGREGATION CANNOT

05:13:52.180 --> 05:13:55.583
AFFORD. TO TAKE IT AT FACE VALUE

05:13:55.650 --> 05:13:57.585
AND THEY MUST RESPOND CANCEL

05:13:57.652 --> 05:13:59.687
SERVICES OR CANCEL THE EVENT AT

05:13:59.754 --> 05:14:01.822
THE- THE COMPLEX OF THE

05:14:01.889 --> 05:14:03.925
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION. AND

05:14:03.991 --> 05:14:06.761
FORCIBLY REMOVE FOLKS FROM THE

05:14:06.827 --> 05:14:09.063
AREA. SAME THING WITH A SCHOOL

05:14:09.130 --> 05:14:11.365
SETTING. THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD

05:14:11.432 --> 05:14:12.600
NOT TO TAKE THESE THINGS

05:14:12.667 --> 05:14:15.036
SERIOUSLY SO WE HAVE TO ALSO

05:14:15.102 --> 05:14:17.338
TAKE THREATS LIKE THIS SERIOUSLY

05:14:17.405 --> 05:14:19.240
. BECAUSE WHEN I HAVE TWO LITTLE

05:14:19.307 --> 05:14:21.309
BOYS IF THERE IS A THREAT LEVIED

05:14:21.375 --> 05:14:23.144
AT THE SCHOOL I'LL BE IF I'M

05:14:23.211 --> 05:14:24.712
GONNA WANT THEM TO STAY IN THERE

05:14:24.779 --> 05:14:26.647
AS WE FIGURED OUT THE MERITS OF

05:14:26.714 --> 05:14:28.416
THIS THREAT. I'M GOING TO WANT

05:14:28.482 --> 05:14:30.351
THE PROTOCOL TO BE IMMEDIATE

05:14:30.418 --> 05:14:32.453
SHUTDOWN REMOVAL OFF PREMISE END

05:14:32.520 --> 05:14:35.423
OF STORY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

05:14:35.489 --> 05:14:37.792
FOR KIDS. THAT MEANS THEY ARE

05:14:37.858 --> 05:14:39.327
TAKEN OUT OF SCHOOL. THEY ARE

05:14:39.393 --> 05:14:41.929
SCARED AND WE ARE NOT PROVIDING

05:14:41.996 --> 05:14:44.599
ANY ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS

05:14:44.665 --> 05:14:47.001
EDUCATION AND COMFORT. THINK OF

05:14:47.068 --> 05:14:49.237
THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF HOW

05:14:49.303 --> 05:14:51.239
THIS TOOL IF USED

05:14:51.305 --> 05:14:53.174
INAPPROPRIATELY CAN AFFECT ALL

05:14:53.241 --> 05:14:55.209
OF US WHETHER IT BE A SYNAGOGUE

05:14:55.276 --> 05:14:56.844
A MOSQUE OR CHURCH OR SCHOOL OR

05:14:56.911 --> 05:14:59.480
UNIVERSITY. OR ANY NUMBER OF

05:14:59.547 --> 05:15:01.749
ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE PLACE AT

05:15:01.816 --> 05:15:05.319
THOSE FACILITIES. THIS BILL IN

05:15:05.386 --> 05:15:08.222
SHORT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE BY

05:15:08.289 --> 05:15:10.591
ALLOWING A THREAT AGAINST AN

05:15:10.658 --> 05:15:13.427
INDIVIDUAL A THREAT AGAINST IT

05:15:13.494 --> 05:15:16.297
INDIVIDUAL TO NOW INCLUDE A

05:15:16.364 --> 05:15:19.934
PLACE. IT SOUNDS IT'S A SOUND

05:15:20.001 --> 05:15:23.271
REASON TO ALLOW FOR AN EXTENSION

05:15:23.337 --> 05:15:24.939
LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE

05:15:25.006 --> 05:15:26.040
PARTICULARITY OF A THREAT

05:15:26.107 --> 05:15:27.608
AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL THAT

05:15:27.675 --> 05:15:29.543
INDIVIDUAL CAN RESPOND OR THE

05:15:29.610 --> 05:15:31.045
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR CAN TAKE

05:15:31.112 --> 05:15:32.980
SENATOR SKINNER OUT OF THE

05:15:33.047 --> 05:15:34.048
BUILDING BECAUSE SHE WAS

05:15:34.115 --> 05:15:36.217
THREATENED. A THREAT AGAINST A

05:15:36.284 --> 05:15:38.152
SCHOOL THE ENTIRE SCHOOL IS AT

05:15:38.219 --> 05:15:42.757
RISK. IT IS A MULTIPLIER EFFECT

05:15:42.823 --> 05:15:44.025
WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION LIKE

05:15:44.091 --> 05:15:46.661
THIS. SO NO I UNDERSTAND THERE

05:15:46.727 --> 05:15:49.730
ARE SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS AT

05:15:49.797 --> 05:15:52.333
THAT WE ALLOW THIS BILL SHOULD

05:15:52.400 --> 05:15:54.802
YOU BE WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD

05:15:54.869 --> 05:15:56.837
AND I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES

05:15:56.904 --> 05:15:57.938
THAT IT IS AT PLAY HERE IS

05:15:58.005 --> 05:15:59.707
WHETHER OR NOT. IT SHOULD NO

05:15:59.774 --> 05:16:02.677
LONGER BE A WOBBLER FOR MINORS

05:16:02.743 --> 05:16:05.346
BUT INSTEAD A MISDEMEANOR. IF I

05:16:05.413 --> 05:16:07.248
WOULD IF I'D BE ENTITLED TO YOUR

05:16:07.315 --> 05:16:08.949
SUPPORT TODAY I GIVE YOU MY

05:16:09.016 --> 05:16:11.419
WORD. I WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE

05:16:11.485 --> 05:16:14.689
WITH THE INDIVIDUALS- IN- WITH

05:16:14.755 --> 05:16:17.258
THE ACLU AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

05:16:17.325 --> 05:16:18.592
AND OTHER FOLKS VERY

05:16:18.659 --> 05:16:20.261
KNOWLEDGEABLE ON HOW RULES LIKE

05:16:20.328 --> 05:16:22.029
THIS CAN APPLY IN BE MISUSED

05:16:22.096 --> 05:16:23.898
SHOULD BE THAT WAY. TO MAKE THIS

05:16:23.964 --> 05:16:27.001
EVEN BETTER BUT I HAVE TO BE

05:16:27.068 --> 05:16:27.802
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY NO THIS IS

05:16:27.868 --> 05:16:30.037
THE THIRD TIME THIS BILL HAS

05:16:30.104 --> 05:16:33.708
BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD. ONCE BY

05:16:33.774 --> 05:16:35.376
TWENTY IN TWENTY NINETEEN BYE

05:16:35.443 --> 05:16:37.044
BYE SIMPLY MEMBER GRAYSON WHICH

05:16:37.111 --> 05:16:38.846
PASSED THE ASSEMBLY PASSED THIS

05:16:38.913 --> 05:16:40.848
COMMITTEE IN JUST GOT HELD UP IN

05:16:40.915 --> 05:16:42.416
APPROACH. I INTRODUCE THIS

05:16:42.483 --> 05:16:45.586
AGAIN- BUT DURING COVE IT AND

05:16:45.653 --> 05:16:47.722
THEN I GOT KICKED OUT BECAUSE A

05:16:47.788 --> 05:16:48.889
COVE IT. AS ALL OF US WERE

05:16:48.956 --> 05:16:50.891
CALLING OUR BILLS FOR THOSE THAT

05:16:50.958 --> 05:16:52.960
WERE BY RICK VERY IMPORTANT. SO

05:16:53.027 --> 05:16:55.029
THIS IS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY AT

05:16:55.096 --> 05:16:57.598
LEAST TO TRICK MY TENURE. AS AS

05:16:57.665 --> 05:17:00.634
A SENATOR AND I WOULD

05:17:00.701 --> 05:17:02.503
RESPECTFULLY- ASK FOR YOUR

05:17:02.570 --> 05:17:04.271
SUPPORT AND AS I MENTIONED

05:17:04.338 --> 05:17:05.873
BEFORE IN CLOSING THIS IS A

05:17:05.940 --> 05:17:07.608
SIMPLE BILL. IT CLOSES A

05:17:07.675 --> 05:17:09.643
LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW AND

05:17:09.710 --> 05:17:12.146
MAKES CLEAR D. OR AMBIGUITY

05:17:12.213 --> 05:17:15.116
CURRENTLY EXISTS- NO INDIVIDUAL

05:17:15.182 --> 05:17:16.417
SHOULD BE SCARED TO ATTEND

05:17:16.484 --> 05:17:20.054
SCHOOL OR GATHER TO WORSHIP IN

05:17:20.121 --> 05:17:22.189
THIS BILL WILL BE HELPFUL.

05:17:22.256 --> 05:17:23.691
COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK

05:17:23.758 --> 05:17:25.126
FOR YOUR I. SUPPORT AND ALLOW ME

05:17:25.192 --> 05:17:27.027
TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BILL

05:17:27.094 --> 05:17:33.300
THROUGH THE NEXT EVOLUTION. A

05:17:33.367 --> 05:17:36.837
THOROUGH BEFORE I CALL ON VOTE-

05:17:36.904 --> 05:17:38.939
I WILL BE VERY HONEST I WOULD

05:17:39.006 --> 05:17:40.341
SHARE THE COMMITTEE I THINK AT

05:17:40.408 --> 05:17:42.810
THAT POINT AND- I DON'T REMEMBER

05:17:42.877 --> 05:17:43.911
THE ANALYSIS ON GRAYSON'S BILL

05:17:43.978 --> 05:17:46.013
SO I. WHILE THE COMMITTEE

05:17:46.080 --> 05:17:47.348
ANALYSIS SHOWS US THEIR

05:17:47.415 --> 05:17:49.383
SIMILARITIES I CERTAINLY CAN'T

05:17:49.450 --> 05:17:53.087
WITH CONFIDENCE SAY THAT. IT IS

05:17:53.154 --> 05:17:55.055
. SAY COMPARABLE TO YOURS AND

05:17:55.122 --> 05:17:57.291
THAT SAY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS

05:17:57.358 --> 05:17:58.893
A MISDEMEANOR NOT SO I'D HAVE TO

05:17:58.959 --> 05:18:00.895
GO BACK AND READ THAT ANALYSIS

05:18:00.961 --> 05:18:02.897
AND REVIEW ALL THE MATERIALS.

05:18:02.963 --> 05:18:06.400
AND IN LISTENING TO THE

05:18:06.467 --> 05:18:09.003
PRESENTATION TODAY I'M STRUCK

05:18:09.069 --> 05:18:10.805
THAT LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY ARE

05:18:10.871 --> 05:18:13.707
ALMOST COMPARABLE. THEN I WONDER

05:18:13.774 --> 05:18:15.376
THREE HONEST ANSWER WHY WE

05:18:15.443 --> 05:18:17.044
WOULDN'T HAVE PUT IT AS AN

05:18:17.111 --> 05:18:18.179
INFRACTION AND NOT A MISDEMEANOR

05:18:18.245 --> 05:18:20.114
BECAUSE IN THESE KIND OF

05:18:20.181 --> 05:18:20.981
CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

05:18:21.048 --> 05:18:23.584
RELATES TO SCHOOLS IF IT'S A

05:18:23.651 --> 05:18:27.121
MINOR. THEN THE- THAT PERSON

05:18:27.188 --> 05:18:28.522
COULD BRING IT TO A CRIMINAL

05:18:28.589 --> 05:18:31.725
OFFENSE I MEAN IT'S GOT SERIOUS

05:18:31.792 --> 05:18:34.495
. THE ACTION AS YOU'RE YOU'RE

05:18:34.562 --> 05:18:36.564
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT CENTER BOARD

05:18:36.630 --> 05:18:39.066
JUST THAT THEIR ACT. DISRUPTS

05:18:39.133 --> 05:18:41.402
EVERYTHING AND ABSOLUTELY WANT A

05:18:41.469 --> 05:18:43.370
PROTOCOL THAT WHEN YOU DON'T

05:18:43.437 --> 05:18:45.206
KNOW WHAT IS REALLY BEHIND THAT

05:18:45.272 --> 05:18:46.974
ACT YOU WANT TO PROTECT

05:18:47.041 --> 05:18:49.944
EVERYBODY YOU HAVE TO- HOWEVER

05:18:50.010 --> 05:18:52.480
SHOULD THE CONSEQUENCE ON A

05:18:52.546 --> 05:18:54.081
MINOR BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IS

05:18:54.148 --> 05:18:58.319
WHAT I THINK. WAIT IT LEAST ARM

05:18:58.385 --> 05:18:59.453
SOME OF US ARE TOYING WITH NOW.

05:18:59.520 --> 05:19:05.926
AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I SAW

05:19:05.993 --> 05:19:08.329
IN THE ANALYSIS IS THAT WHILE.

05:19:08.395 --> 05:19:11.232
THE IT'S SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY

05:19:11.298 --> 05:19:13.267
KIDDED THAT THEY REQUIRES THE

05:19:13.334 --> 05:19:14.502
PERPETRATOR TO NAME OF THE

05:19:14.568 --> 05:19:16.170
VICTIM IN ORDER TO DO THE

05:19:16.237 --> 05:19:18.772
PROSECUTION THERE WERE CITATIONS

05:19:18.839 --> 05:19:20.941
OF CASES WHERE THE PERPETRATOR

05:19:21.008 --> 05:19:22.776
IN THESE CASES WAS A MINOR AT

05:19:22.843 --> 05:19:24.578
THE HIGH SCHOOL DIDN'T SPECIFY

05:19:24.645 --> 05:19:26.380
THE VICTIM BUT INSTEAD TARGETED

05:19:26.447 --> 05:19:27.348
ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF OF

05:19:27.414 --> 05:19:28.716
PARTICULAR HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY

05:19:28.782 --> 05:19:32.219
WERE PROSECUTED. SO AGAIN NOT

05:19:32.286 --> 05:19:34.221
BEING THE DA NOT BEING A LAWYER

05:19:34.288 --> 05:19:36.857
YOU KNOW IS IT THAT I'M SURE

05:19:36.924 --> 05:19:39.260
LIKE A LOT OF US- HI EVERYBODY

05:19:39.326 --> 05:19:40.828
WANTS THINGS YOU KNOW

05:19:40.895 --> 05:19:45.633
COMPLETELY- DIGITAL NO GRAY AREA

05:19:45.699 --> 05:19:47.601
RIGHT BUT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT

05:19:47.668 --> 05:19:49.303
THERE IS THE ABILITY TO

05:19:49.370 --> 05:19:50.671
PROSECUTE OR AT LEAST IN THAT

05:19:50.738 --> 05:19:52.373
CASE THAT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED

05:19:52.439 --> 05:19:53.874
AND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF OTHER

05:19:53.941 --> 05:19:59.580
CITATIONS. SO I AM. YEAH YOU

05:19:59.647 --> 05:20:01.448
KNOW I'M VERY. WISHING THE

05:20:01.515 --> 05:20:02.783
MISTER BRADFORD WAS HERE SO THAT

05:20:02.850 --> 05:20:04.251
HE COULD EXPRESS BECAUSE HE'S

05:20:04.318 --> 05:20:06.453
THE CHAIR DOT YOU KNOW I'M

05:20:06.520 --> 05:20:07.721
SITTING IS THAT YOU'RE RIGHT NOW

05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:10.457
BUT I. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

05:20:10.524 --> 05:20:12.259
YOU KNOW HIS THE COMMITTEE'S

05:20:12.326 --> 05:20:13.894
AGENDA MAY BE VERY CROWDED FOR

05:20:13.961 --> 05:20:17.298
ITS REMAINING TWO HERE THANKS-

05:20:17.364 --> 05:20:19.867
AND I THINK FOR YOU KNOW WE DID

05:20:19.934 --> 05:20:21.702
LEASE FOR MY I WOULD HAVE TO

05:20:21.769 --> 05:20:24.305
FULLY. ANALYZE THE GREASE UNTIL

05:20:24.371 --> 05:20:25.039
BEFORE I'D BE COMFORTABLE

05:20:25.105 --> 05:20:28.542
SAYING. YOU KNOW SO I THINK THE

05:20:28.609 --> 05:20:29.610
BEST. I'M JUST THINKING RIGHT

05:20:29.677 --> 05:20:32.513
NOW ON THE FLY THE BEST WE COULD

05:20:32.580 --> 05:20:32.980
DO PERHAPS IS GIVE YOU

05:20:33.047 --> 05:20:37.151
RECONSIDERATION. AND THEN ALLOW.

05:20:37.217 --> 05:20:39.553

APOLOGIES FOR DOING- TO LOOK AT

05:20:43.724 --> 05:20:45.893
THAN THAT AT THE COMPARABILITY

05:20:45.960 --> 05:20:47.861
IS BETWEEN THE TWO BILLS AND

05:20:47.928 --> 05:20:49.430
WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO YOU

05:20:49.496 --> 05:20:50.998
KNOW MODIFY IT SUCH AND STILL

05:20:51.065 --> 05:20:52.967
MOVE THAT. I'M PERSONALLY

05:20:53.033 --> 05:20:54.868
THINKING THAT. EVEN A

05:20:54.935 --> 05:20:56.837
MISDEMEANOR WOULD NOT BE

05:20:56.904 --> 05:20:58.739
APPROPRIATE THAT IT ISN'T

05:20:58.806 --> 05:21:00.507
ESPECIALLY FOR MINOR THAT IT'S

05:21:00.574 --> 05:21:03.377
MUCH MORE IN THE INFRACTION AREA

05:21:03.444 --> 05:21:05.346
BUT GO AHEAD SIDNEY. I AM SORRY

05:21:05.412 --> 05:21:07.281

THREATS IN MIND OF AN ACTUAL AND

05:21:12.886 --> 05:21:15.155
PERCEIVED BUT- ITS ACTION THEY

05:21:17.458 --> 05:21:19.560
