NEVADA HAVE ALSO JOINED THE

WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR PAROLE

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:31.517
AND PROBATION OFFICERS WHO WERE

01:56:31.584 --> 01:56:34.087

PRISON AXE TO SIT TO CIVIC

01:56:46.165 --> 01:56:47.233

01:56:53.673 --> 01:56:56.175
FURTHER AD BLOCKING PEOPLE ON

01:56:56.242 --> 01:56:57.677
PAROLE FROM VOTING MEANS OUR

01:56:57.744 --> 01:56:58.511
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE WORKING

COMMITTEE AND THE BOTTOM LINE

01:58:46.452 --> 01:58:50.289
IS THIS. SENDS ON PAROLE HAVE

01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:52.825

SOCIETY. AND LET'S NOT FORGET.

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:11.210
THESE PERSONS HAVE CREATED VERY

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:11.777
HAVE COMMITTED VERY SERIOUS

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:16.148
CRIMES MURDERS. RAPES. THESE

01:59:16.215 --> 01:59:19.852
ARE THINGS THAT. CHANGE

01:59:39.572 --> 01:59:40.006
HAVEN'T COMPLETED THEIR

01:59:40.072 --> 01:59:42.275
PENNANTS THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED.

01:59:46.746 --> 01:59:47.280
PRO ONCE THEY'RE OFF PAROLE WE

01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:50.550
ALLOW THEM TO VOTE. THAT'S FAIR.

01:59:50.616 --> 01:59:53.786
THAT IS MORE THAN FAIR. AND WE

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:54.320

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:55.354
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS

01:59:55.421 --> 02:00:00.793
ISSUE. I ALSO THINK IT'S

02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:03.563
IMPORTANT FOR US TO THINK ABOUT.

02:00:03.629 --> 02:00:05.231
YES YOU KNOW OUR OUR DEMOCRACY

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:07.066

PEOPLE CERTAIN RIGHTS GET TAKEN

02:00:10.002 --> 02:00:13.439
AWAY. AND I DOUBT THAT MY

02:00:13.506 --> 02:00:16.142
COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO.

02:00:16.208 --> 02:00:18.778
WOULD BE ADVOCATING THAT

02:00:18.844 --> 02:00:19.312
PAROLEES GET THEIR SECOND

02:00:19.378 --> 02:00:22.548
AMENDMENT RIGHTS RESTORED.

FATHER ON PAROLE WHAT HE AND

02:00:23.449 --> 02:00:24.784
TRUST THEM WITH OWNING A

02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:26.419
POSSESSING A FIREARM AS THEIR

02:00:26.485 --> 02:00:28.621
REQUIRE AS THEY HAVE A

02:00:28.688 --> 02:00:29.455
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DO

02:00:29.522 --> 02:00:32.124
UNDER THE SECOND AMENDMENT. BUT

02:00:32.191 --> 02:00:34.293
HE WANTS TO RESTORE THEIR

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:34.894
VOTING RIGHTS YOU WON'T TRUST

02:00:34.961 --> 02:00:37.396
HIM WITH THE GUN. BUT YOU'D

02:00:37.463 --> 02:00:37.997
LIKE TO ENTRUST THEM WITH OUR

02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:41.467
DEMOCRACY. NOW LOOK THERE ARE

02:00:41.534 --> 02:00:43.603
PEOPLE OUT THERE. WHO HAVE

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:44.904
COMMITTED CRIMES HAVE DONE

02:00:44.971 --> 02:00:46.339
THEIR PENNANTS AND THEY ARE

02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:48.374
WORKING TO BE REHABILITATED

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:51.277
BACK AND TO SOCIETY I BELIEVE.

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:52.678
M. REPENTANCE I BELIEVE THAT

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:53.879
PEOPLE CAN BE CHANGE THAT

02:00:53.946 --> 02:00:57.516
PEOPLE CAN BE RE REHABILITATED.

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:58.150
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY

02:00:58.217 --> 02:01:00.219
SHOULDN'T FACE CONSEQUENCES.

02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:03.856
FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. THAT

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:04.423
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD

02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:06.058
FORGET ABOUT THEIR VICTIMS. AND

02:01:06.125 --> 02:01:09.762
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. IN THAT

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:12.164
YES ONCE THAT SENDS IS COMPLETE

02:01:12.231 --> 02:01:14.066

PARTICIPATING THEIR DEMOCRACY

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:18.604
AND THEY DO. SO I THINK IT'S A

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:20.106
PRETTY SIMPLE CHOICE FOR US

02:01:20.172 --> 02:01:21.173
TODAY THERE'S REALLY NOTHING

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:23.342
WRONG WITH CURRENT LAW AND WE

YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN YOUR

02:04:49.648 --> 02:04:53.152
DEMOCRACY. AND ULTIMATELY LET'S

02:04:53.219 --> 02:04:54.119
THINK ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF

Y. PAROLEES ARE THOSE THAT HAVE

02:04:57.156 --> 02:04:58.290

BUILD A VOTE AND WE KNOW QUITE

02:05:21.247 --> 02:05:23.883
CLEARLY. UP THROUGH OUR HISTORY

02:05:23.949 --> 02:05:25.384

AWAY FROM THEIR DEMOCRACY. AND

02:05:38.297 --> 02:05:40.532
TO ALLOW FOR AN ELECTORATE THAT

02:20:06.731 --> 02:20:08.199
POLICY ON SOME FLAWS THAT MIGHT

02:20:08.266 --> 02:20:09.267
EXIST THAT'S NUMBER ONE IN THE

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:11.536
SYSTEM ITSELF. BUT WE HAVE TO

02:20:11.603 --> 02:20:12.604
BASE IT ON THE FACT OF WHAT WE

02:20:12.670 --> 02:20:14.606
KNOW IS RIGHT. WHAT IS JUST AND

02:20:14.672 --> 02:20:16.941
WHAT IS GOOD FOR US. WE HAVE

02:20:17.008 --> 02:20:18.843
TRIED EVERYTHING THIS STATE TO

02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:20.345
BECOME HARDER AND HARDER ON

02:20:20.411 --> 02:20:22.547
CRIMINALS. AND ONLY THINK IT IS

02:20:22.614 --> 02:20:24.516
DONE IS MADE A HARD HARDER. AND

02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:26.484
MADE HARD TO CRIMINALS. WE HAVE

02:20:26.551 --> 02:20:29.487
NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM YET. WE

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:30.655
SAW THAT WITH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:32.490
AS WE REDUCE THE NUMBER FROM

02:20:32.557 --> 02:20:34.359
TEN THOUSAND IN DJJ NOW TO

02:20:34.425 --> 02:20:34.893
SEVEN HUNDRED BY HAVING A

02:20:34.959 --> 02:20:37.162
DIFFERENT POLICY AND A PROGRAM

02:20:37.228 --> 02:20:38.163
TO HELP THEM IN THEIR HOMES AND

02:20:38.229 --> 02:20:40.899
FAMILIES. SO WE START TALKING

02:20:40.965 --> 02:20:41.966
ABOUT VOTING I'M JUST AT A

02:20:42.033 --> 02:20:45.503
QUANDARY AS WHAT DO WE THINK

02:20:45.570 --> 02:20:48.473
WOULD HAPPEN. IF A PERSON VOTED.

02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:49.107
IF A PERSON THAT WE DIDN'T LIKE

02:20:49.174 --> 02:20:51.776
VOTED. AND A LOT OF FOLKS I

02:20:51.843 --> 02:20:55.613
DON'T LIKE WHO VOTE A LOT OF

02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:56.214
FOLKS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:58.616
THEIR MORALS THAT VOTE. AND YET

02:20:58.683 --> 02:21:00.051
WE HAVE NOT RESTRICTED THEM

02:21:00.118 --> 02:21:01.586
BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:02.854
THAT WAS FOUNDED ON A

02:21:02.921 --> 02:21:04.022
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE. NO

02:21:04.088 --> 02:21:06.858
TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION

02:21:06.925 --> 02:21:09.060
ATTACKS PERSON IN THE STATE YOU

02:21:09.127 --> 02:21:10.829
THEN DESERVE TO DECIDE WHO YOUR

02:21:10.895 --> 02:21:12.564
REPRESENTATIVE WILL BE THAT IS

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:13.865
A FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN

02:21:13.932 --> 02:21:15.700
PRINCIPLES THAT I LEARNED IN

02:21:15.767 --> 02:21:17.135
KINDERGARTEN. NO TAXATION

02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:19.370
WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. AND OUR

02:21:19.437 --> 02:21:21.973
DESIRE TO BE PUNITIVE TO ATTACK

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:23.474
INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:21:23.541 --> 02:21:26.778
WE PUNISH THEM ENOUGH. HAS NOT

02:21:26.845 --> 02:21:28.146
PROVEN IN ANY WAY TO MAKE US

02:21:28.213 --> 02:21:30.381
SAFER TO MAKE THE STATE

02:21:30.448 --> 02:21:31.449
STRONGER AND HAS MADE OUR

02:21:31.516 --> 02:21:33.551
BUDGET BASICALLY BLOW UP IN

02:21:33.618 --> 02:21:35.620
TERMS OF ALL THE THINGS WE'VE

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:36.221
DONE THAT HAVE NOT IN ANY WAY

02:21:36.287 --> 02:21:38.890
HELPED. CLEARLY THERE'S A NEED

02:21:38.957 --> 02:21:40.525
FOR CHANGE. AND I DON'T THINK

02:21:40.592 --> 02:21:42.894
ANYONE WALKS AROUND THE STATE

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:45.597
WORRYING ABOUT SOMEBODY VOTING.

02:21:45.663 --> 02:21:47.365
WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUT MAY

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:48.566
HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME THAT WE

02:21:48.633 --> 02:21:50.702
DID NOT LIKE. THAT IS GENERALLY

02:21:50.768 --> 02:21:52.103
NOT THE CONCERN OF BOTH OF US

02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:54.172
WALKING UP AND DOWN THE STREET

02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:55.306
EVERY DAY THAT IF THAT PERSON

02:21:55.373 --> 02:21:57.008
HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE THEY

02:21:57.075 --> 02:21:58.343
WOULD COMMIT MORE CRIMES WHAT

02:21:58.409 --> 02:21:59.711
KIND OF THINKING IS THIS. THE

02:21:59.777 --> 02:22:02.447
LOGIC IS JUST NOT BE HERE. AND

02:22:02.513 --> 02:22:03.414
SO WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT

02:22:03.481 --> 02:22:04.916
FOLKS WHO GO ON IAN WHO HAVE

02:22:04.983 --> 02:22:06.885
EARNED THE RIGHT TO BE PAROLED

02:22:06.951 --> 02:22:08.887
KEEP THAT IN MIND. THEY'RE JUST

02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:10.355
NOT TURNED OUT. THERE BURN THE

02:22:10.421 --> 02:22:12.523
RIGHT FOR PAROLE. AND I

02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:13.758
APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE OVER

02:22:13.825 --> 02:22:15.126

02:22:15.193 --> 02:22:16.828
UNDERSTANDS NOW THAT HE'S

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:18.062
WORKING WITH THEM THAT THESE

02:22:18.129 --> 02:22:20.265
FOLKS HAVE SPENT YEARS TRYING

02:22:20.331 --> 02:22:21.532
TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND DEAL

02:22:21.599 --> 02:22:24.068
WITH THE ISSUES. AND COMING OUT

02:22:24.135 --> 02:22:25.203
AND GIVING THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS

02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:26.871
A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT WE

02:22:26.938 --> 02:22:28.206
SHOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE TO

02:22:28.273 --> 02:22:30.441
THEM TO ALLOW THEM TO EXPRESS

02:22:30.508 --> 02:22:32.744

02:52:34.644 --> 02:52:35.878
TO MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT THEIR

02:52:35.945 --> 02:52:38.114
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IT ALSO

02:52:38.181 --> 02:52:38.715
RECOGNIZED THAT STATES DO HAVE

02:52:38.781 --> 02:52:41.784
A LEGITIMATE INTEREST. WHEN A

02:52:41.851 --> 02:52:44.053
FETUS BECOMES VIABLE WHEN WE'RE

02:52:44.120 --> 02:52:45.955
DEALING WITH A CHILD. AND SO

02:52:46.022 --> 02:52:51.794
THAT. IN RECENT YEARS HAS

02:52:51.861 --> 02:52:52.395
BECOME A BIG DEBATE BECAUSE WE

02:52:52.462 --> 02:52:56.165
SEE THAT. WE DO HAVE TO WE DO

02:52:56.232 --> 02:52:59.502
HAVE A PERSON ANOTHER PERSON.

02:52:59.569 --> 02:53:00.069
IT'S RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE TO

02:53:00.136 --> 02:53:06.743
DEAL WITH HERE. IT ISN'T SIMPLY.

02:53:06.809 --> 02:53:07.343
JUST A WOMEN'S RIGHTS ISSUE IT

02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:10.146
IS ALSO. THE RIGHTS OF THIS I'M

02:53:10.213 --> 02:53:13.349
OF UNBORN CHILDREN. AND SO

02:53:13.416 --> 02:53:14.784
STATES ARE WRESTLING WITH THIS

02:53:14.851 --> 02:53:15.985
QUESTION WHAT IS THE MORAL

02:53:16.052 --> 02:53:17.854
RIGHT THING TO DO. HOW DO WE

02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:19.722
ENSURE THAT THOSE RIGHTS. ARE

02:53:19.789 --> 02:53:22.158
PROTECTED AS WELL. AND IT'S

02:53:22.225 --> 02:53:24.560
SOMETHING THAT THIS STATE.

02:53:24.627 --> 02:53:26.129
ULTIMATELY HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH.

02:53:26.195 --> 02:53:30.867
AS WELL. AND I THINK WE NEED TO

02:53:30.933 --> 02:53:33.269
HAVE MORE ROBUST CONVERSATIONS

02:53:33.336 --> 02:53:35.872
ABOUT THIS LESS US VERSUS THEM

02:53:35.938 --> 02:53:36.706
CONVERSATIONS AND MORE REALLY

02:53:36.773 --> 02:53:38.574
TRYING TO GET DOWN. TO THE

02:53:38.641 --> 02:53:41.611
HEART OF ISSUES. AND TRY TO

02:53:41.677 --> 02:53:43.412
ENSURE THAT THERE ARE RIGHTS

02:53:43.479 --> 02:53:45.548
DUE PROCESS. MANY QUALITY FOR

02:53:45.615 --> 02:53:49.619
ALL. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:52.255
JUST A SIMPLE. ONE WHERE THE

02:53:52.321 --> 02:53:55.892
OTHER DISCUSSION. AND I THINK

02:53:55.958 --> 02:53:58.194
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND I

02:53:58.261 --> 02:53:58.795
JUST I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO

02:53:58.861 --> 02:54:00.963
HAVE MORE OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT.

02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:01.531
THOSE RIGHT SOME OF THE MOST

02:54:01.597 --> 02:54:06.402
ARDENT. ADVOCATES PRO LIFE

02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:07.436
ADVOCATES IN THIS DEBATE RIGHT

02:54:07.503 --> 02:54:09.872
NOW ARE WOMEN SO WHEN I HEAR

02:54:09.939 --> 02:54:12.575
THAT IS JUST MEN MAKING

02:54:12.642 --> 02:54:13.142
DECISIONS THAT'S COMPLETELY

02:54:13.209 --> 02:54:16.012
WRONG IN AN ACCURATE. WHILE A

02:54:16.078 --> 02:54:17.180
ROSE IS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE

02:54:17.246 --> 02:54:20.683
ARTNET VOICES A WOMAN AT THE

NATIONAL LEVEL TALKING ABOUT

02:54:21.317 --> 02:54:24.053
THIS VERY THING. SO I WOULD

02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:25.521
VENTURE TO SAY THOSE TWENTY

02:54:25.588 --> 02:54:26.322
FIVE MILLION WOMEN HAVE

02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:28.758
DIFFERENT OPINIONS. AND I THINK

02:54:28.825 --> 02:54:30.026
WE SHOULD RESPECT THOSE

02:54:30.092 --> 02:54:31.327
OPINIONS AND WE SHOULD HAVE.

02:54:31.394 --> 02:54:36.132
AGAIN. A MORE IN DEPTH THE

02:54:36.199 --> 02:54:37.400
ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT

02:54:37.466 --> 02:54:40.670
IT'S NOT. THAT SIMPLE. THANK
