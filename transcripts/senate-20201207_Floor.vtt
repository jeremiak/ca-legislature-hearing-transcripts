THE SWINE FLU WAS GENETICALLY

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:13.326
THE CLOSEST STRAIN OF FLU TO

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.862
THE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN PANDEMIC

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.231
THAT THE WORLD HAD SEEN SINCE.

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:21.234
THE CDC NOW ESTIMATES THAT

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.403
SIXTY MILLION AMERICANS ABOUT

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.673
ONE IN FIVE OF US WERE INFECTED

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.174
WITH THE H. ONE AND ONE. ON THE

PEOPLE WERE REALLY WORRIED HOW

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.248
BAD WOULD IT BE HOUSE SICK

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.251
WOULD PEOPLE GET HOW FAST WITH

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.853
THE VIRUS SPREAD. FORTUNATELY

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.189
WE WOULD SOON DISCOVER THAT THE

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.425
H. ONE N. ONE VIRUS WELL HIGHLY

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.093
CONTAGIOUS AND DIFFICULT TO

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.362
CONTAIN. DIDN'T MAKE PEOPLE

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.165
VERY SICK AND WITH LESS DEADLY

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.701
THAN THE FLU. THE WORLD GOT

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:59.238
LUCKY. SEVERAL YEARS LATER IN

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.239
TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LARGEST

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.675
OUTBREAK OF THE EBOLA VIRUS

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.011
OCCURRED IN WEST AFRICA. THIS

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.513
TIME THE VIRUS WAS EXTREMELY

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.083
DEADLY AN AVERAGE OF 50% OF

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.419
THOSE WHO CONTRACTED EBOLA DIED

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:15.722
BUT UNLIKE H. ONE N. ONE EBOLA

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.690
IS FAR LESS CONTAGIOUS IT'S

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.859
HARDER TO CATCH REQUIRING VERY

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.928
CLOSE PHYSICAL CONTACT TO

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.130
SPREAD. WE JUST HEALTH WORKERS

MOBILIZED AND WERE ABLE TO

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.837
CONTAIN THE DISEASE AND

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:33.640
MINIMIZE THE SPREAD. JUST

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:36.175
ELEVEN CASES AVAILABLE LAST

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:39.612

EXPERIENCED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:58.698
THAT WOULD BE BOTH VERY LETHAL

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.100
AND HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS. WE ALSO

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:03.936
KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:06.039
BE FULLY PREPARED AND TELL WHAT

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:11.911
