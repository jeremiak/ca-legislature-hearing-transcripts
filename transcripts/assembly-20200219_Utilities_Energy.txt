TO CALL THIS- COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT HEARING ON ELECTRICITY PRICES TO ORDER THIS IS- IMPORTANT TOPIC AND I BELIEVE A VERY TIMELY ONE SO WE HOPE THAT OUR PRESENTERS WE EXPECT AND ANTICIPATE WILL BE OF VERY INFORMATIVE IN HELPING US TO FOCUS ON OF THE COST OF. ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR RATE PAYERS LET ME SAY GOOD AFTERNOON TO ALL OF YOU INTO OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE IN THE COMMITTEE AND THOSE LISTENING OR PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCEEDING OF LET ME HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT OUR VICE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE START THE MEETING WITH THE VICE CHAIR PRESENT- HE IS NOT ABLE TO BE WITH US TODAY HE'S OUT IN HIS DISTRICT ON BUSINESSES AFTERNOON BUT SENDS HIS REGRETS WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS WILL BE JOINING US WE THINK IS THE KIND OF TOPIC THAT MOST MEMBERS HAVE RESPONDED TO VERY FAVORABLY SO WE ANTICIPATE- AS PAUL KNOW HOW THE COMING AND GOING OF. OF VARIOUS ACTIVITIES AROUND THE CAPITAL WILL FORCE MEMBERS TO HAVE TO LEAVE OR COME A LITTLE LATE BUT WE'RE ANTICIPATING FULL PARTICIPANT XIN. A HOLDING THIS. HEARING A TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE AFFORDABILITY OF ELECTRICITY AND CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY. TO ELECTRIFY SECTORS WITH HIDES. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE ELECTRIFICATION OF TRANSPORTATION BUILDINGS COULD OFFER THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PATH. TO DEEP THE CARBONIZATION A RECENT REPORT BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S WHO'S WITH US TODAY CAUTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA'S RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN MOST OTHER STATES. HI ELECTRICITY PRICES COULD SLOW TRANSITION AWAY FROM GASOLINE DIESEL AND NATURAL GAS OF THE COSTA POWER ELECTRICAL ALTERNATIVES BECOMES PROHIBITIVE. OVER THE LAST DECADE THE ANNUAL EMISSIONS FROM THE ELECTRIC SECTOR HAVE DECLINED BY ABOUT FORTY MILLION METRIC TONS OR 40% THOSE REDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM THE ELECTRIC SECTOR WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY EMISSIONS. DECLINING PRICES THE RENEWABLES ARE PROVIDING THE MEANS TO THE CARBON EYES THE ELECTRIC SECTOR AND CORRESPONDINGLY SECTORS WHICH MUCH HIGHER. EMISSIONS PROFILE SUCH AS THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND RESIDENTIAL. HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN THERE HAS BEEN A DISTURBING DISTURBING INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES BEYOND THE RATE OF INFLATION IN THE RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN MOST OTHER STATES. RETAIL ELECTRICITY RATES ARE HIGHER DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE DECLINING ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION AND COSTS FOR VARIOUS STATE MANDATED PROGRAMS THAT ARE EMBEDDED ELECTRICITY RATES. DECLINING CONSUMPTION EQUATES TO FIX COST BEING SPREAD OVER A SMALLER BASE OF CUSTOMERS. UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS PER PRECIPITATING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY RATES AND WHAT ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE TO REVERSE THE UPWARD TREND IS VITAL. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS THAT INCREASE ELECTRICITY PRICES HAVE ON RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR CRITICAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS. THROUGH GREATER ELECTRIFICATION. THE WITNESSES WE HAVE COMING FOR BEFORE US TODAY ARE WELL POSITIONED TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES. LET ME FIRST- TURN TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- TO SEE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS BEFORE I CALL THE PANEL FORWARD- BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE TAKE THIS ISSUE UP EARLY AT OUR SESSION BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT LEGISLATION MOVING FORWARD WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF ITS IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS BECAUSE I THINK AS WE'VE HEARD. AND HERBAL HOUSING OF SIDE OF THE WORLD THE RENTS ARE TOO DARN HIGH. THAT'S MY EDIT. THE ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE TOO DARN HIGH. AND SO IF- THERE ANY MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN OPENING COMMENT I'LL TURN TO THEM NOW. THIS RACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR ELEVATING THE ISSUE ELECTRICITY RATES AND FOR ORGANIZING THIS HEARING. AS YOU NOTED MISTER CHAIR IN THE RECENT. LA REPORT ON THE ELECTRICITY GENERATION IT'S MADE CLEAR THAT THESE HIGH UTILITY RATES AND PRICES ARE GOING TO BE A BARRIER FOR FUTURE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. R. G. H. G. TOOK TARGETS ARE VERY AMBITIOUS AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT IS A STATE WE MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. AS THESE UTILITY RATES INCREASE THAT LIKELIHOOD DECREASES DURING OUR LAST HEARING THE CPUC PRESIDENT TO MERRY BELL BOETTCHER. STATED THAT FOR EVERY BILLION AND WHILE FARM WITH WILD FIRE MITIGATION COST RATE PAYER RATES WILL INCREASE BY 7% THAT'S FRIGHTENING. NOT ONLY THAT BUT UTILITIES RATES HAVE ALSO BEEN GOING UP FASTER THAN INFLATION. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE RESIDENTIAL RATES HAVE RISEN. NINE AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HIGHER THAN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OF 19% LAST YEAR WE VOTED AND POUNCED. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I TRUST IN THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO. HOLD THE PGA ANY TO THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN. I KNOW THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE NOT EASY BUT WE HAVE TO FIND MIDDLE GROUND ONE THAT INSURERS WE CAN MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND ONE THAT DOES NOT BURDEN OUR RATE PAYERS I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S CONVERSATION. THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK. I'M GOING TO SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE A SKEPTICAL REPUBLICAN ON THIS BUT- LOOK THE C. E. C. DECIDED AWHILE AGO. THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DEMAND ROOFTOP SOLAR. ON NEW BUILDINGS AND I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE. IT IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SIMPLY WHAT WE'RE PLANNING TO DO ANYWAY WHICH IS TO HAVE FAILED- WELL FOR TROUT THERE'S ALREADY MANDATE. TO GO A 100% RENEWABLE WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL MANDATE. AND ROOFTOP SOLAR SIMPLY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN HAVING A SOLAR FARM- IT'S SEVERAL TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE. FURTHER YOU THEN HAVE THE PEOPLE ARE BUYING NEW HOMES BY AND- MUCH MORE- HIGH INCOME THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON GETTING A BREAK ON THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE SOLAR. AND THAT'S BEING PAID FOR OUT OF THE GENERAL RATE CASE. I CAN'T FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH THAT IS BUT I WILL BE ASKING THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES WILL COME UP HERE TO LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE IT IS INCREASING COST. A SECOND THING WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE DOING A LOT OF ENERGY CONSERVATION BURKE WORK ON BUILDINGS AND YET. WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT WORK IT DOESN'T PAY OFF. IT SIMPLY DOESN'T RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE AT UC BERKELEY AM I T. AND CHICAGO. AS WELL AS OUR REPORTS DONE HERE WHICH I'VE LOOKED AT IN THE PAST I DIDN'T COME PREPARED TO BRING ALL THOSE REPORTS WITH ME BUT I COULD- WHICH SIMPLY SHOW. THAT THE ESTIMATES OF. ARE NOT AT ALL CLOSE TO THE ACTUAL SAVINGS IN THE ACTUAL SAVINGS ARE SEVERAL TIMES LESS BILL FOR ELECTRIC AND GAS USAGE. SO WE'RE JUST NOT SPENDING OUR MONEY RIGHT AND IF WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS WE REALLY OUGHT TO RETRIEVE THEM IN THE CHEAPEST WAY POSSIBLE AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN ROOFTOP SOLAR SHOULD BE MANDATED. IT MEANS WE BUILT MORE ENERGY FARMS AT SOLAR ENERGY FARMS AND IF WE'RE GONNA DO OUR ENERGY CONSERVATION WE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MONEY IT ACTUALLY SAVES WE'RE SPENDING BILLIONS ON THAT AND IT'S NOT GETTING THE PAY OFF. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY BUT THE NUMBERS ARE THERE AND IT'S NOT SO. THERE IT IS. THANK YOU. OUR WILL IF THERE ARE NO OTHER OPENING THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS TO BE SHARED WILL TURN TO OUR PANEL. AND I LIKE TO CALL FORWARD ROSS BROWN WITH THE OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S WILL GO FIRST DR JAMES. BUSHNELL PROFESSOR AT DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS LINDA SERIZAWA. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ENERGY OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE. AND SCOTT KREIDER VICE PRESIDENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC WHEN A WELCOME ALL OF YOU. AND WE'LL TURN TO YOU MISTER BROWN TO START OUR CONVERSATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ROSS BROWN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. TODAY I'M JUST GONNA OFFER SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS AND SOME SUMMARY COMMENTS BASED ON SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE DID IN THE REPORT THAT YOU REFERENCED EARLIER MISTER CHAIR THAT WE RELEASED IN JANUARY WHAT'S REALLY THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THAT REPORT WAS ASSESSING KIND OF WHAT WE KNOW AND DON'T NOW ABOUT THE AFFECTS OF THE STATE'S MAJOR CLIMATE POLICIES IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR- AND I'LL BE SPEAKING TO A JUST A PIECE OF THAT- WHICH WE TOUCH ON TOWARDS THE END OF THE REPORT. ON TO SEE RATES- BUT AS WE CANNOT START THIS DISCUSSION I JUST- AGAIN SIR SUMMARIZING SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL CONTEXT WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS DISCUSSION- AS YOU MENTION MISTER CHAIR ELECTRICITY HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN THE STATES. AT THE STATE HAS MEDI YOU TWENTY TWENTY GOAL A FEW YEARS EARLY AND IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO ESSENTIALLY KIND OF ALL OF THOSE REDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN FROM ELECTRICITY GENERATION- AND IN PARTICULAR A CHANGES IN THE MIX OF ELECTRICITY. SOURCES OF IS TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY. NOW WHEN YOU LOOK OUT TOWARDS THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS IN THE BEYOND THAT THOSE. MORE AND SO- YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA REQUIRE REDUCTIONS FROM OTHER SECTORS BEYOND JUST ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT- EMISSION REDUCTIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS. YOU KNOW A LECTURE CITY AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDINGS AND IN PARTICULAR THIS QUESTION OF. ELECTRIFICATION AND THAT BEING ONE OF THE- POTENTIAL PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVING SOME OF THE MORE AMBITIOUS. REDUCTIONS AND WHAT ROLE KIND OF OUR OUR POLICIES ELECTRICITY SECTOR PLAY AN INDYCAR NICE IN THOSE OTHER SECTORS. AND THEN THAT BRINGS US TO. THE ISSUE OF THE HIGHLIGHT TRICITY RATES AND WE DO THINK THAT IT COULD BE- ONE BARRIER TO ACHIEVING THOSE MORE AGGRESSIVE EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. RATES ARE YOU'LL HEAR FROM A PROFESSOR BUSH NOW ON SOME OF THEIR GOOD WORK IN LOOKING AT RATES AND ELECTRICITY RATES BEING QUITE A BIT HIGHER THAN. THE MARGINAL COST OF PRODUCING ELECTRICITY INCLUDING SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH. DOING THAT AND WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL FOR SORT OF A RETAIL RATE ON TURN IN TERMS OF CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR IS. AND HOW IT MIGHT SERVICE BARRIER TO EMISSION REDUCTIONS THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY RATES RETAIL RATES ARE HIGHER THAN OTHER STATES AND HIGHER THAN SOCIAL MARGINAL COST SOME OF THOSE. THE BIG I THINK SOME OF THE BIG POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS ARE HOW WE TREAT FIX COSTS INCLUDING THOSE AND VOLUMETRIC ELECTRICITY RATES. THE OTHER IS STATE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES AND THOSE ARE BUILT INTO BIOMETRIC RATE SO WE DON'T HAVE A REALLY CLEAR BREAKDOWN OF ALL THE DIFFERET FACTORS AND AGREE TO WHICH THEY CONTRIBUTE BUT- THOSE ARE. SOME OF THE DIFFERENT FACTORS- AND SNOW THAT THE EFFECTS OF THOSE HIGHER RATES- CAN HAVE ECONOMIC AFFECTS YOUR DISCOURAGING VALUABLE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES FROM BOTH HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS WERE TALKING ABOUT US AND SERVING AS A BARRIER TO ELECTRIFICATION OF. ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR- BUILDINGS IMPLANTS IS. SO I THINK THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECT OF THIS ISSUE IS YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT- AND YOU KNOW IT I THINK THERE'S GENERALLY NOT A LOT OF EASY ANSWERS SO THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS I THINK IN FRONT OF YOU AS YOU. LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. I'M I THINK GENERALLY ENCOURAGING RATE STRUCTURES WHERE THE RETAIL RATE THAT A CONSUMER BUSINESS FACES THAT REFLECTS. THAT KIND OF MARGINAL COST OF GENERATING THE ELECTRICITY INCLUDING THE- ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS IS KIND OF A GOOD- OVERALL APPROACH AND THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW TO SET RATES NOW THE CHALLENGE. IS IF THE STATE MOVES IN THAT DIRECTION THEY'RE ALL THESE OTHER. COSTS RELATED TO FIX COSTS FOR DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION LINES AS WELL AS STATE PROGRAM COSTS AND- IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE THOSE IN THE ELECTRICITY RATES THAN THAT MONEY IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE. RAISED IN SOME OTHER WAY AND THAT'S WHERE YOU YOU FACE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT- YOU KNOW COUPLE THE OPTIONS I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT END UP HEARING ABOUT OUR- FIX CHARGES. SO YOU KNOW. A CARD XIN DOLLARS PER MONTH THAT IS NOT BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY CONCERT YOU CONSUME. IS KIND OF ON AVENUE THAT I THINK YOU'LL HEAR A LOT OF OTHER STATES. USE ANOTHER UTILITIES USE TO CUT RECOVER SOME OF THE FIXED COSTS SO THAT WE THINK THAT'S- WORTH EXPLORING THERE ARE TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATE WITH DOING THAT BUT IT. IT'S WORTH EXPLORING. AND THEN THE OTHER I THINK JUST BROAD CATEGORY OF- KIND OF SOLUTIONS ARE WORTH EXPLORING AS- LOOKING AT OTHER FUNDING SOURCES FOR SOME OF THE STATE. PROGRAM COSTS AGAIN. THOSE THERE'S NOT EASY ANSWERS THERE AND THERE ARE CLEAR TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH USING OTHER FUNDING SOURCES LIKE. CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS- AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF KIND OF CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION WHEN THOSE TRADE OFFS- BUT WE DO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO BE THINKING ABOUT AND- AND LOOKING AND STILL AND CONTINUING TO EXPLORE. SO I'LL IN MY COMMENTS THERE. WELL WE'LL HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE WANTS ALL THE PRESENTATIONS REMAIN. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I I'M GONNA END UP ECHOING A LOT OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SENT BY ROSS AND SEVERAL OF THE MEMBERS- SO I'LL LET ME BE ABLE TOGO A LITTLE QUICKER. SO I WAS GONNA TRY TO PUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE POLICY IN THE STATE- AS WE WORRY HEARD THIS IS A GREAT OVERSIMPLIFICATION BUT- TENSION HE- DISTILLING DOWN THE CLIMATE PLAN TO THESE TWO STEPS WERE GOING TO TRY TO ZERO OR- PLEASE TAKE. A LOT OF THE CARBON OUT OF THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR- AND THEN. TRY TO TRANSITION ALL THESE OTHER SOURCES WHICH ARE GOING TO BE HIGHER CARBON INTENSIVE INTO ELECTRICITY WHICH BY THEN WOULD BE. RELATIVELY CLEAN RELATIVELY LOW CARBON AND AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL THAT SORT OF THE MOST. DOMINANT PARTS OF OUR CLIMATESTRATEGY. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD WE'VE WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES ON THE ELECTRICITY SIDE- AND- WE'VE ACHIEVED OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS ALREADY THAT'S ALL COME ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM REDUCTIONS IN THE ELECTRIC SECTOR- THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THE INDUSTRIAL AND NATURAL GAS SECTOR THAT'S THE GREEN AND YELLOW BARS THERE. REALLY HAVEN'T- DECLINE MUCH IN THE LAST DECADE AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START TO MAKE ME YOUR HEAD WILL PAY IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET TO OUR TWENTY THIRTY. ON GOALS. SO THAT'S BACK THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HEARD IS. REALLY STEP ONE- AS WE PUSH MORE ON STEP ONE IT MAKES STEP TO A PARTNER WE ARE. ALL THE FIREMEN AND OTHER POLICY CHOICES WE'VE ALREADY ABOUT OF THEM. ARE THEY'VE CONTINUE TO PUT UP PRESSURE ELECT PRICES. ARE PARTICULARLY VARIABLE ACTRESS YOU PRICES ALL GET INTO- AND THAT LEAVES US IN A WEIRD CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE ELECTRICITY IS BY FAR THE CLEANEST OPTION FOR OF FUEL. BUT IT'S ALSO FROM A CONSUMER STANDPOINT BY FAR THE MOST EXPENSIVE OPTION AND SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE. TO EMBRACE ELECTRICITY AS A AS A- SOURCE OF FUEL FOR OTHER SECTORS WERE REALLY SORT OF. CREATING HEADWINDS FOR OURSELVES BY MAKING IT VERY COMMERCIALLY UNATTRACTIVE WITH THESE PRICES. WHY ARE PRICES HIGHER WE HAVE THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT THAT THE MORE BUT I PUT THIS UP HERE IT'S MUCH MORE. THAN I HAVE TIME TO DESCRIBE THIS IS FROM A COLLEAGUES ELECTRICITY BILL WHERE. IT'S BROKEN OUT BY SOME ROUGH SECTORS AND ONE OF THE POINTS HERE IS THAT YOU CAN SEE THE GREEN. RED BARS ARE GROWING- OVER THE LAST HALF DECADE THOSE ARE ESSENTIALLY INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS WHAT ROSTER FOR TWO IS FIXED COSTS. THESE ARE COSTS THAT DON'T GO DOWN WHEN. PEOPLE OF. IT'S ALL ARE ON THE ROOFTOPS OR DON'T GO WHEN. CHARGING EVEY- THEY ARE A CLASS OF CONNECTIVITY NOT COSTS OF USAGE- AND- THE PEOPLE WHO REGULATE UTILITIES ACROSS THE WORLD OF HER STRUGGLED WITH THE RIGHT WAY TO TRY TO. RECOVER THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ALONG WITH THE COST OF ACTUALLY PRODUCING THE ELECTRICITY THE PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING- AND IT COMES DOWN TO IS ROSS MENTIONED THIS BALANCE BETWEEN. TRYING TO RECOVER SOME OF THE COST THROUGH A MONTHLY SORT OF SUBSCRIPTION FEE- THAT YOU PAY JUST FOR CONNECTIVITY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE BASICALLY- THAT'S ON- THAT'S NOT LINKED TO THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY YOU'RE CONSUMING. AND THEN A VARIABLE FEE PER UNIT OF ENERGY ON TOP OF THAT I USED TO DESCRIBE CELL PHONE PLANS TO MY STUDENTS BUT NOW EVERYBODY GETS FREE DATA ANYWAY SO IT'S LESS INFORMATIVE- BUT IT'S NOT AN UNUSUAL SORT OF COST STRUCTURE IN A LOT OF KIND OF UTILITY SETTINGS- NOW. IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT. AMONG PRACTICED IN CALIFORNIA A LARGE REGULATED UTILITIES- RECOVER ALL OF THEIR COSTS THROUGH A VARIABLE FEE THERE IS A MINIMUM BILL IT'S VERY MODEST- AND- THAT PUTS MORE OF THE COST BURDEN INTO THE VARIABLE FEE AND THAT CONTRIBUTES TO HIGHER. VARIABLE PRICES- THIS IS JUST A COUPLE MAPS FROM WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES EVAN BOURNE STING WORRIED AND SCRAPING ELECTRIC RATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR QUITE SOME TIME OFF THE WEB. THE DARK THE TO HEAR THE HI THE CHARGES AND ESSENTIALLY THIS IS THE- FIXED CHARGE THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE. PAID BY IF YOU'RE CONNECTED TO UTILITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY- CALIFORNIA'S AT THE EXTREME HERE OF HAVING IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT NEGATIVE BECAUSE YOU GET THIS CALIFORNIA CLIMATE REBATE WHEN YOU'RE CONNECTED TO A- REGULATED UTILITY. IN ADDITION TO NOT HAVING TO PAY A MONTHLY FIXED FEE- SO THERE IS THERE AREN'T COSTS BEING RECOVERED TO THIS FEE AND THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THIS PICTURE. WHICH IS THE VARIABLE COMPONENT OF THE PRICES- WHERE- CALIFORNIA IS I SHOULD SAY AMONG THE HIGHEST- I. WAS JUST LOOKING AT THIS RHODE ISLAND UNDER SOME METRICS COULD CLAIM THAT THE CHAMPIONSHIP BELT HERE BUT- CALIFORNIA MAY BE PASSING THEM SOON. POINT WE HAVE VERY HOT VARIABLE ACTRESS. IS FOR MANY REASONS ONE OF WHICH IS THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT RECOVERING ANY OF THESE INTEREST COSTS THROUGH MY- FIXED FEE. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PLUGGING A CAR AND EVEY- INTO YOUR METER- IT'S THIS PRICE YOU'RE GONNA PAY PER KILOWATT HOUR AND THAT'S PART OF THE CONCERN WE HAVE- ALL RIGHT SO WHAT THE REACTIONS I'VE GOTTEN ONE OF PRESENTED THIS WORK. UP VERTICALLY FROM THE VIRAL COMMUNITIES WELL ISN'T IT THEY HAVE HIGH ELECTRICITY PRICES IS NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE WANT TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM USING ELECTRICITY. AND I GUESS WE'VE GOT A BILL TO FAR WITH IT. THIS IS. EFFICIENCY ENERGY IF. TO YOU. THE ENTER KEY. WHY EFFICIENTLY NOT THAT USE IT AT ALL AND SO IF WE WANT TO THINK THE SITE OF OUR HI GO THEN YOU HAVE THAT WILL HOW HIGH IS TOO HIGH THEN- AND ONE METRIC ONE THAT THAT ECONOMIST SORT OF EMBRACE IS THIS IDEA OF COMPARING THE COST OF THE TURNING ON A LOW FALL BELOW. GOING IN YOU ELECTRIC ARE UP TO THE COST ACTUALLY PUT RIDING THE ELECTRICITY TO THAT CONSUMER WHO IS GOING TO BE USING IT- AND THIS IS A COMBINATION OF THE COST OF GENERATING ELECTRIC THE MARKET GENERATE AND CAUGHT AN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDENT WE HAVE BEEN THE SAME ISSUE ERICA THERE SIR. IN ACOSTA INCLUDE. ANY METRIC. AT THIS. REALLY APPEALING ASK IN ITS EXCEPT WHERE PRODUCING THE POWER THE MORE ACOSTA SACK QUITE. IT'S CAPITAL. SO THE OVERALL CAN HI. BUT THINKING OVER. LANTS YOU A LOT FRONT EXPENDED BUT ACT PRODUCE THE ELECT. IS ESSENTIALLY FREE ARM AND THEREFORE WE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM USING IT ONCE WE'VE MADE THOSE INVESTMENTS ABOUT OUR PRICING STRUCTURE ISN'T. DOING THAT IT'S ALSO CLEAN SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY CHEAP TO PRODUCE CLEAN ELECTRICITY BUT OUR PRICES DON'T REALLY REFLECT THOSE FACTS- OKAY SO THIS US ALARMING MAP IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT POLITICAL. IT'S A- IT'S A MESS. THE RELATIVE COST OF PROVIDING THAT ELECTRICITY TO A CUSTOMER AND SO THE DARKER THE BLUE HERE BASICALLY THAT'S THE DEGREE TO WHICH PRICES ARE TOO HIGH BY OUR METRIC. THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE VERY LOW PRICE EXCEEDS THE COST TO BE A PROVIDING THAT CUSTOMER WITH THE ELECTRICITY AGAIN INCLUDING CARBON COST LOCAL AIR POLLUTANT AND A FEW OTHER- FEDERATION. NOW THERE ARE PARTS OF THE- HE IS TO KEEP. THE INS WITH THE LAW OF COAL CREATING A LOT OF SOUL FOR THE CAUSES DAMAGE FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONE OF THOSE STATES- CALIFORNIA IS A STATE WHERE PRICES ARE EXTREMELY HIGH RELATIVE TO THE COST OF PROVIDING INCREMENTAL POWER TO THOSE STATES- NOW. I'LL SO. ELECTRICITY WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE GOAL THAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO SWITCH PEOPLE FROM ALL. THOSE OTHER SOURCES OF FUEL TO ELECTRICITY. AND SO AGAIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVING MORE IN THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THE SAME EXERCISE FOR THE OF FUELS. SO WE PROJECT ONE YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD THE ANSWER ARGUABLY YES- THAT GASOLINE WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OF A BURNING GASOLINE PARTICULARLY IN SOME URBAN AREAS IS ARGUABLY A LITTLE TOO CHEAP BOB CERTAINLY RELATIVE TO ELECTRICITY WHICH IS MASSIVELY OVER PRICE- WE ARE AGAIN WORK IN PROSPERED BY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO FROM THE UNDER PRICE TOOL TO THE PRICE FUEL. THAT PASSES BETWEEN THE STRUCTURE THAT THERE IS WELL AND SO ARE MET AT LEAST A LITTLE. BUT NOT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE ELECTRIC SECTOR. ALL RIGHT SO STEPS THAT COULD HELP- GORY HEARD ACTUALLY MOST OF THESE- POINT TO BE MADE- SO ONE WOULD BE TO STOP ADDING. CALL BUT THAT DID A TO BE DELAY TO THE ELECTRIC SECTOR BUT ARE NOT DIRECTLY ELATED TO THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY. AND ADDING THEM TO ELECTRIC BILLS AND I THINK- OF WILDFIRE RELATED COSTS ARE GOING TO BE CERTAINLY THE BIG- THE TICKET ITEM THAT WILL BE WILL BE DEBATED GOING FORWARD HERE- BUT THE OTHERS WE HEARD ABOUT ENERGY EFFICIENT. GRAMS OUR PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT LOW INCOME ENERGY CONSUMERS WHICH ARE CERTAINLY WORTH WHILE DOING BUT IT'S ALL WORTH ASKING WHETHER THE SHOULD BE FUNDED FROM ELECTRIC RATES THEMSELVES. ARE OTHER WAYS TO TRY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. THEN THIS POINT IS TO THE EXTENT WE CAN'T SHIFT SOME OF THESE PUBLIC POLICY COSTS ON TO OTHER REVENUE SOURCES- TRY TO REDESIGN THE TERRORISTS THEMSELVES IN WAYS THAT BETTER ALIGN WITH THE COST SENATE COURAGE PEOPLE TO USE THE ELECTRICITY NGUYEN AND WHERE. IT BRED IN BACK SHOW FOR THEM TO DO SO AND THAT WOULD AS ROSS SAID PROBABLY INVOLVED RECOVERING AT THE A LITTLE MORE THAN ZERO SUM COSTS FROM A- MONTHLY FIXED CHARGE IF WE WERE. BASICALLY A CARE VERSION OF A MONTHLY FIXED CHARGE- TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. AND THEN LASTLY- AND- I THINK ASSEMBLYMAN QUIRK STOLE SOME OF MY THUNDER HERE- WEEK. THERE'S AN ARGUMENT TO SUPPORT CLIMATE POLICIES THAT THAT ARE TARGETING REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS THAT MY TIME- BUT NOT NOT NEARLY OVERLY STRICT IN THE CHURCH A SET. OF UP UTILITIES OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF DOING IT I THINK THE THAT SOUL THE ROOF TAKE MEANT ROOFTOP MAN IS IT IS AN EXIT. WERE PUSHING LETTER G. TO HONEST. BACK OUT IT SHOULD BE THE ONE ALLOW FLICK. FOR FINDING THE LOWEST COST WAYS OF ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS RIGHT THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LINDA STARS OUT AND I'M THE DIRECTOR IN THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE BUT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING- WE THINK IT'S VERY. IMPORTANT TO AND GOOD TIMING A TO HAVE OF THE DISCUSSION OF WHERE WE FOCUS ON THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN LIKE ELECTRIC ALL ELECTRIC BILLS. I WANT EMPHASIZE THAT I PRESSED TO TODAY FOLK. EXCLUSIVE ON RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS RATES BILLS- I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE SOME. OF SOME KEY THEMES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IN THE PRESENTATION. SO STARTING WITH TWO. FIRST OF ALL SOME OF YOU PROBABLY HEARD THE STATEMENT THAT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY RATES ARE TRACKING OR ON PARK OR ON PAR WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND THAT WAS TRUE UP UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THE THAT IS NOW THE RATES ARE FAR OUTPACING THE RATE OF INFLATION AND WE'LL SHOW YOU DATE ON THAT. THING IS WHEN YOU HEAR THAT STATEMENT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT RATES ARE BEING REFERENCED WHEN THEY SAY RATES ARE TRACKING WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION. OTHERS DIFFERENT DEFINING RATES SO USUALLY WHEN YOU HEAR THAT STATEMENT. THE STATEMENT IS REFERRING TO SYSTEM AVERAGE RATES AND SYSTEM AVERAGE RATES ARE CUT THE COMBINED RATES ALL THE CUSTOMER CLASSES FROM THE LARGEST WHICH WHICH WOULD BE THINK IT DOES COST. TO THE SMALLEST VERSUS CUSTOMERS REALLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO DRILL DOWN DEEPER INTO CUSTOMER CLASS SPECIFIC GRADES AND EVEN BEYOND THAT YOU CAN GO FURTHER BEYOND THAT IF YOU IF YOU TIME AT THE END OF MY PRESENTATION I CAN FOCUS ON. WHAT DRIVING LOW LOW YOU CUSTOMER RATES AS WELL WHICH A SUBSET OF RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. SO THE MORE AGGREGATE THE RATE THE SYSTEM AVERAGE RATE THE MORE THE MASKING OF THE IMPACT ON RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF INCREASED RATES. MOVING ON TO SLIDE THREE. I WANT TO MENTION THE PRIMARY DRIVERS TO THE RATE INCREASES THAT WE'RE SEEING FIRST THERE'S BEEN A STEADY INCREASE IN REVENUE REQUIREMENT UTILITIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO CHARGE FOR CUSTOMERS REVENUE REQUIREMENT IS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THE MONEY AT THE UTILITIES. ARE AUTHORIZED TO RECOVER FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS. PUT ANOTHER WAY IT'S THE COST THAT RATE PAYERS PAY FOR THEIR SERVICE. SO WE'VE SEEN A STEADY INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR OF UTILITIES REVENUE REQUESTS. AND WE HAVE SEEN ALSO OF THE A DECLINE THIS IS THE SECOND DRIVER A DECLINE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES VOLUMES. A AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS BASICALLY THE ELECTRICITY SOLD TO CUSTOMERS. UGH THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE ARE GREAT SUCCESSES IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN ROOFTOP SOLAR. SO MOVING ON TO SLIDE. FOR HERE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT SOME DATA OF I'M GONNA PULL BACK AND LOOK AT SYSTEM AVERAGE RATES AGAIN THESE ARE COMBINED RATES OF WERE CAUGHT THE LARGEST BASICALLY TRACKING WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION. OF ITS OWN THIS TIME PARTICULARLY FOR P. GINNY INDUSTRY GENIE THAT YOU SEE SIGNIFICANT SALES DECLINES PARTICULARLY FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. ARE FROM RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. YOU ALSO SEE THAT EDISON SYSTEM AVERAGE RATE TRACKS PRETTY MUCH ON PAR WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION FOR NOW. BEING TO SLIDE FIVE. HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE RESIDENTIAL SALES VOLUMES SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE AGAIN STARTING AROUND TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR P. JEANNIE AND SGD. AND YOU WILL SEE DECLINE FOR EDISON SALES AROUND TWENTY FIFTEEN AS YOU MAY BE WONDERING BUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID THAT'S THE SYSTEM AVERAGE RATE FOR EDISON WAS TRACKING WITH THE RATE INFLATION SO. THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE THINK THAT SO IS EVEN DESPITE THE SALES DECLINE AS- AROUND THAT TIME WE SAW EDISON TAKING SOME SIGNIFICANT COST CUTTING MEASURES. A WE SAW THAT PRIMARILY IN THEIR GENERAL CASE APPLICATIONS. THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS TO THAT END OF SUCH AS A REFUND SO THEY WERE REQUIRED TO GIVE TO CUSTOMERS TO THE SONGS. MOVING TO SLIDE. SIX NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET EVEN MORE SPECIFIC WE'RE LOOKING AT OF THE RESIDENTIAL THE AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL RATES. SO HERE YOU'LL SEE US USING THESE REPRESENTED BY THE REDLINE. THEIR RATES OF INCREASE 57% SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE UP THROUGH JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY. ONE REPRESENTS P. GENIES RATES AND THE GREEN LINE EDISON'S. AND AGAIN THE DAUGHTER GRAY LINE IS THE RATE OF INFLATION. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REVENUES WHICH IS THE MONEY THAT THE UTILITIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO RECOVER FROM THE CUSTOMERS. AND SALES WHICH IS WHAT THE UTILITY BECAUSE IT'S PAID FOR SERVICE. YOU TAKE THE REVENUES YOU DIVIDE BY THE SALES AND YOU GET THE AVERAGE WAS INITIAL RIGHT. SO MOVING ON TO SLIDE SEVEN. YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHERE IT'S GOING. END THIS GRAPH SPECIFICALLY FOCUSES ON MESSAGING NEEDS RESIDENTIAL RATES. WITH ANY FORECAST YOU HAVE TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS SO WHEN WE DID THIS FORECAST OF VEGGIES RATES WE ASSUME THAT EVERY. PENDING REQUEST THAT THEY HAVE BEFORE THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN APPROVED THERE'S BEEN NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE REQUESTS. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THE GRAY LINE REPRESENTS THE HISTORIC RATE. STARTING FROM. TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. THE YELLOW PART REPRESENTS THE FORECAST. AND THE OTHER PART IS A COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED AND ARE GOING TO GO INTO A FACT. AS A. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND THOSE THINGS ARE AGAIN PENDING. YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR RATE IS FORECAST TO FAR OUTPACE THE RATE OF INFLATION. I FOR COMPARISON SAKE THE GREAT DOTTED LINE HERE- WE TOOK THE RATE OF INFLATION AND JUST ESCALATED SEEKING SEE FOR SAKE THE RATE WOULD BE IF IT WAS JUST ESCALATED FOR INFLATION. MOVING TO SLIDE EIGHT THIS IS A FORECAST OF P. GENIES RESIDENTIAL RATES. AGAIN THE GRAY LINE REPRESENTS THE HISTORIC RATE AND THE YELLOW LINE IS A FORECAST. THE YELLOW LINE ASSUMES THAT P. GENIES MOST RECENT GENERATE CASE REQUEST HAS BEEN APPROVED NO ADJUSTMENTS. AND MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS OUR FOCUS OF EDISON'S AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL RATE. YOU RECALL THAT EDISON'S RATE WAS TRACKING WITH INFLATION BOTH SYSTEM AVERAGE AND RESIDENTIAL. OUR FORECAST HOWEVER SHOWS THAT NOPE THERE COULD BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE FACTORED IN THEIR MOST RECENT GENERATE CASE REQUEST OF OVER TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH THEY FILED IN NOVEMBER. THIS ASSUMES THAT A- THAT RECALL. IS. SO CLEARLY OF EDISON'S RATE IS NOT WE DON'T FORECASTED CONTINUING TO TRACK WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION GET THE RATE OF INFLATION. SLIDE TEN SO I UNDERSTAND RATES ARE RATES BUT CUSTOMERS CARE ABOUT THEIR BILLS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY PAY. THIS CHART SHOWS STDS RESIDENT RESIDENTIAL BILLS WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN PAYING AT WHAT WE FOR CUSTOM TO PAY. AGAIN ANY FORK OUT WITH ANY FORECAST YOU HAVE TO MAKE. CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS. SO WE ASSUME FIRST OF ALL THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE BILL'S OF LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. ALSO THE TWENTY TWENTY DID A POINT ON IS A FORECAST OF REVENUES AND SALES. ED WE ASSUME CONSTANT USAGE WHICH MEANS THAT WE DON'T WE AVERAGE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINTER AND SUMMER RATES. OF AND CLIMATE ZONES. SO YOU'LL SEE THE BLUE LINE REPRESENTS AS TEACHING NEEDS COASTAL ZONE. FOR QUALITY SOUND. THE ORANGE LINE IS OUR INLAND ZONE WHICH INCLUDES PLACES LIKE FALLBROOK CHULA VISTA. AND THE RED LIGHT PRESENTS A MOUNTAIN SO WHICH INCLUDES PALOMAR AND CAMPBELL. OUR FORECAST SHOWS THAT. REGARDLESS OF CLIMATE SO CUSTOMERS COULD SEE AS MUCH OF A 38% INCREASE IN THEIR BILLS SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THROUGHOUT THE NEXT FEW SLIDES IS REGARDLESS THE CLIMATE SO WE ARE SEEING SIGNAL TICKET BILL INCREASES. THING TO DO SLIDE ELEVEN FOCUSING ON TEACHING RESIDENTIAL BILLS. AGAIN THIS IS NOT INCLUDE THE BILL'S OF LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. THE BLUE LINE THE BOTTOM LINE. REPRESENTS THE COMMUNITIES EUREKA SAN FRANCISCO SAN LUIS OBISPO. THE ORANGE LINE UKIAH SAN JOSE THE MORE MODERATE ZONES. AND THE REDLINE. IS THE HOTTEST AREA AND TEACHING SERVICE TERRITORY CENTRAL VALLEY. BASED ON OUR FORECAST WE COULD SEE AS MUCH AS A 46% INCREASE ACROSS THE CLIMATE ZONES. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SIR FORECAST OF EDISON'S RESIDENTIAL BILLS. AGAIN THE BLUE LINE IS THE COASTAL COMMUNITY OR COLORS OWN INCLUDING ORANGE IN SANTA BARBARA. ORANGE IS THE MODERATE STONE FROM CLEANING VENTURA. AND THE RED LINE REPRESENTS THE HOTTEST SO INCLUDING SAN BERNARDINO. EDISON'S CUSTOMERS COULD SEE AS MUCH AS A FIFTY NINE PERCENT INCREASE ACROSS CLIMATE ZONES. I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS JUST A FOCUS ON ELECTRICITY RATES. THAT IT DOES NOT FACTOR IN NATURAL GAS RATES WHERE WE ALSO HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES. AS AN EXAMPLE FOR PGD RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS. BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY WE'VE SEEN A 15% INCREASE IN THE RATES. SO NOW. WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO. WHAT THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS DOING IS WE ARE TRACKING THESE INCREASES AND WE ARE TRYING TO TRACK THE POTENTIAL INCREASES WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WE DEVELOPED A TWO. OUR COMPUTER MODEL. THAT WILL HELP DECISION MAKERS SEE THE IMPACT OF POTENTIAL RATE AND BILL INCREASES. SO WHENEVER YOU TO ATTY CME TO THE COMMISSION AND ASKED FOR MORE RIGHT HERE FUNDING. YOU CAN INPUT FROM NATION INTO OUR COMPUTER MODEL AND SEE WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THESE KINDS OF REQUESTS THAT COME IN A DAY AT THE COMMISSION. AND IT'S HARD TO SEE. PACKED ONE OFF. IT'S BETTER TO SEE THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THOSE OF THOSE REQUESTS SO THAT DECISION MAKERS CAN PRIORITIZE THE DECISIONS AND SEE WHAT IMPACT THERE WILL BE ON CUSTOMERS. THE TOOL IS GOING THROUGH THE VETTING PROCESS OF WE'RE WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION STAFF ON IMPLEMENTING THE TOOL. ON A MAKING IT TRANSFORMATION TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC. WE'RE HOPING THAT OTHER UTILITIES WILL ASSIST IN USING THE TOOL AND THAT EVERY TIME THEY FILE AN APPLICATION OF THE COMMISSION REQUESTING REPAIR FUNDING BILL RUN THE NUMBERS THROUGH THE- MODEL OR- A SIMILAR ONE. AND PROVIDE INFORMATION. SO WITH THAT I'LL I'LL STOP THERE. WELL THANK YOU OUT MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERSSO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION MY NAME SCOTT CRATER ON THE VICE PRESIDENT OF CUSTOMER SERVICES FOR ST YOU GAS ELECTRIC AND I HEARD TODAY THIS IS A REALLY TIMELY DISCUSSION AND YOU KNOW. WHAT DID ANY ARMED NO WE PROVIDE A VERY UNIQUE SERVICE- TO RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA REALIZE THAT TRANSIT GAP THIS IS JUST LIKE WATER IS A LITTLE LIFE TO CENTRAL PARK CONDOM AND SO WHAT TO. MAKE WE ARE STATE SOME BARBELL GOAL WHAT THIS TIME ART REALLY KEEPING IN LINE THAT YOU CAN AND THAT THIS CAN HAPPEN OR SWEAR SINCE FOR HERBAL CUSTOM. THANK YOU VERY. THE THIS DISCUSSION. I'M SKIP OVER DISSONANT OF TIME TO RECOVER QUITE A BIT IN JUST F THE FREE OF WHERE WE'RE IN TERMS OF WHERE THE RATES IN THE BILLS ARE FOR THE VERY SHE TOLD EASE- I'LL SAY AT THE ALL THERE ARE A RATES ARE HIGHER THEN I WON'T NEED THE DECK. ARE OUR RATES ARE HIGHER THAN WHAT WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE AND WE'VE CERTAINLY HEARD A LOT ABOUT ON THE INCREASES THAT WE'VE SEEN- BUT LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME THE TUBES TAX IT REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW THE INVEST. MEETING G. JANET. DOES COME ONE OF THE CLEANEST. YOU TO. IN AMERICA. 45% OF OUR ENERGY COMES FROM RENEWABLES- THAT SPECIALLY THE EARLY YEARS OF THE OUR PS THAT CERTAINLY. UP COSTS MORE. ABOUT WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF THE STEPS THAT WE'VE TAKEN- TO DELIVER MORE CLEAN ENERGY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE'VE ALSO BEEN NAMED THE MOST RELIABLE ELECTRIC UTILITY IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES FOR THIRTEEN YEARS IN A ROW. SO YOU KNOW OUR OUR CUSTOMERS WANT TO HAVE RELIABLE POWER AND WE'VE DEVELOPED A SYSTEM. AND A DELIVERY MECHANISM- THAT MAKE SURE THAT- WE CAN BE- THE BEST IN THE WEST UNITED STATES BETTER FACTORED NAMED. THE MOST RELIABLE UTILITY IN AMERICA. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND I THINK OF. ALL THE- MEMBERS ARE WHAT OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE IN TERMS OF WILD FIRE AFETY- OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS- SO THAT TO HELP KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. SO I AM GONNA COVER JUST BRIEFLY SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS WE TALK A LOT ABOUT IT NOW. I AND BLAH IN A BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING IT DOWN TO KIND OF A REAL UTILITY LEVEL- AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S REALLY FOR- PRIMARY DRIVERS OF WHY WE'RE SEEING. HIGHER RATES AND ULTIMATELY HIGHER BILLS YOU'VE HEARD IT. SALES ARE DECLINING YOU KNOW SO FOR US ARE OVERALL SALES NOT JUST RESIDENTIAL ARE DOWN ABOUT AND THAT AGAIN THAT IS VIRTUALLY. TO THE SUCCESS STATE WE'RE SEEING LESS GOODUSAGE BECAUSE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND A MASSIVE MASSIVE INCREASING AMOUNT OF SOLAR POWER- SPECIALLY IN THE SAN DIEGO REGION. HOPE IS THAT AS WE BEGIN TO SEE MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES COME ONLINE- WE DO WE WILL SEE YOU KNOW SEE MORE LECTURE VACATION DOWN THE LINE THAT WE CAN GET. A START TO STABILIZE THE SALESMAN THAT WOULD COULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ITS- CERTAINLY GOOD EFFORT THE- SMITH. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS THE PIE. YOUR DOCTOR WILL. IN THIS CASE BUT THE WIRES WE USE TO DELAY ELECT. FOR CUSTOMERS YOU KNOW WHAT HE- KEEPS SO LOT. OF YEARS UPPER BG. VESTED ONE POINT FIVE. DOLLARS AS IN YOU FIRE SAFE PROGRAM IN ORDER PROTECT OUR CUSTOMER FROM CALLOUS. ALL THOSE ARE INVESTMENT THAT RISK I THINK THE- THERE WERE. IN TO WE CAN NEXT TO SEE INVEST IN A FEW TO KEEPER COMMUNITIES. WHAT NUMBER THREE REALLY POLICY MANDATES SO THIS IS A FAIRLY LARGE BUCKET THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD- LOW INCOME PROGRAMS ENERGY EFFICIENCY S. CHIP- YOU KNOW ALL YOUR MOST OF THEM AT LEAST I WE THINK ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS. ASPECTS YEAR LOW INCOME PROGRAMS- IN TAKING AND TAKEN AS KIND OF A SINGULAR PROGRAM IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BUT WHEN YOU START TO ADD ALL THESE TOGETHER. WE ACTUALLY ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 22% OF OUR ELECTRIC RATE IS MANDATES AND SO IT IS BECOMING A- A BIGGER CHUNK OF. OF OUR OVERALL RATE OUTLOOK. FINALLY IN THE MORE BILLS SO WE AGAIN WE TALK A LOT ABOUT RATES IN THE END A CUSTOMER SEES A BILL. LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF HOW WHAT IS THE TOTAL THAT I OWED ES DE GENIE IN A GIVEN MONTH. I TALKED WHAT'S OF MURDERS. BETTER ISSUE THE NOT PAY. PAY BILLS. WE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT A LOT YOU KNOW HERE IN THE STATE AND CERTAINLY IN THE LEGISLATURE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS HOTTER LONGER AND MORE INTENSE SUMMERS IN SAN DIEGO THIS INCLUDES OUR COASTAL REGIONS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE EXPERIENCE THE SIX HOTTEST WEEKS WE'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN SAN DIEGO AND THAT'S HOUSING MORE ELECTRICITY DEMAND. REGION AND AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST- IN ONE CUSTOMERS THAT IS ALSO STARTING TO AFFECT OUR OUR MORE TEMPERATE CLIMATE- COASTAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AND SO THIS IS BECOMING- A TRUE IMPACT CLIMATE IS BECOMING A TRUE IMPACT ON ACTUAL ENERGY BILLS. SO THAT THOSE ARE KIND OF THE DRIVERS TO LET ME TALK ABOUT JUST LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS ONCE A VERY SPECIFIC POLICY AND THEN- MAYBE THREE TRENDS THAT FOR AT THAT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. I YOU KNOW WHAT WE THAT PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE TERM ACTIONS THAT WE COULD TAKE. IT PERFORMING THAT ENERGY METERING POLICY THAT SO THIS IS THE SUBSIDY- THAT WE PAY TO. TO SOLAR OWNERS NOW. LET ME BE CLEAR FROM THE GET GO IS THAT ESTROGEN STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF OUR CUSTOMERS. ADDING SOLAR BUT TO THEIR HOMES- MATTER FACT WE'VE GOT ABOUT 13% OF OUR CUSTOMERS TODAY THAT ABOUT SOLAR AND THAT SO THAT IS A MASSIVE INCREASE. IN THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR IN SAN DIEGO. BUT WHAT IT IS DOING IS THAT IS SHIFTING BECAUSE THOSE FOR CUSTOMERS FOR AVOIDING COSTS. YOUR VOIDING HAVING TO PAY FOR THE GRID WE'RE SEEING NOW AN ESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. OF COSTS THAT ARE BEING SHIFTED FROM OUR SOLAR CUSTOMERS. FOR NON SORT CUSTOMERS. OKAY SO WE DO WANT TO BALANCE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FAIR AND EQUITABLE ENERGY POLICY THAT BALANCES THE NEED TO WE WANT MORE SOLAR. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HELPS DRIVE DOWN CHICHI THAT HELPS US WITH OUR CLIMATE GOALS BUT THERE IS AN EQUITY ISSUE BECAUSE WHAT IS OCCURRING AS I THINK ABOUT OUR- YOU KNOW OUR FAMILIES IN EL CAJON INLAND VERY HOT AREA YOU KNOW IF. WE HAVE FOUR MAYBE MAKE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND AFFORD SOLAR DOESN'T HAVE THE MEANS TO PUT SOLAR ON THEIR HOMES THEY'RE NOW PAYING A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT- PENALTY. ON THEIR ENERGY. FOR POOR FLUENT. TO BE ABLE TO PUT SALT ON THEIR HOMES. OKAY SO AGAIN AS POLICY MAKERS WERE GONNA NEED TO BALANCE. THE YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE OF EQUITY. WITH THE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL A PROGRESS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS COMPLETELY AN EQUITABLE. IN IN TERMS OF THAT ENERGY METER POLICY NEAR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DID MAKES VERY VERY MINOR TWEAKS AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT- EXPECTING TO HAVE A MORE FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF NET ENERGY METERING IS SUPPOSED TO BE KICKED OFF IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT SITTING HAS NOT STARTED YET OUR AND CERTAINLY NUMBER FORM WAS A COMPONENT OF AB THREE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH WAS THE LAST. COULD BE ENERGY- ENERGY RATE RESTRUCTURING BILL BACK AND TWENTY THIRTEEN SO THAT'S KIND OF A VERY. SPECIFIC POLICY THAT WE THINK ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY LONGER TERM WE REALLY NEED TO START HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT RESTRUCTURING HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF RATES AND HOW WE PRICE ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE- YOU KNOW I WOULD YOU KNOW WE STILL COULD HAVE TO THOUGHT SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN. MY OF HOW DEVELOP RATES FOR THERE ARE SOME PENS THAT WE KEEP IN MY MIND AS WE THINK ABOUT RATE NINE RATE STRUCTURES AND ULTIMATELY THAT AFFECTS. CUSTER PERSONAL. ABOUT IT TODAY ELECTRIFICATION SO TODAY CHARGING VOLUME POLICE OF ME WITHOUT YOU KNOW EACH CUSTOMER PAYS FOR KILL HOUR OF THAT THEY USE SOME HOURS OF THE DAY OUR CUSTOMERS COULD PAY FIFTY OR SIXTY CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR OKAY AND IF AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO. IT IT'LL CLASS FAMILIES BECAUSE FAMILY THROUGHOUT CANDY A GO TO SWITCH TO HAVE TO KEEP THESE IN THE GARAGE HAVES THE ELECTRIC SPACE HEATING AT THE LEDUC WATER HEATING ELECTRIC COOKING. AT THOSE PRICES IT'S ON AFFORDABLE AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO START HAVING A REAL FUNDAMENTAL- DISCUSSION ABOUT COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURING HOW WE PRICE ELECTRICITY. NUMBER TWO. IS NOT COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION NOW LET ME BE CLEAR WE ARE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF OUR CUSTOMERS- GOING COMMUNITIES SEGREGATION WE GOT GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CCA'S. NDA AND BURKE THERE TO HELP MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL. AS YOU THINK ABOUT BILLS THOUGH THE ENERGY BILLS CUSTOMER SEES- AS MORE OF OUR CUSTOMERS MOVE OVER TO CCA'S WE THINK THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE CCA'S IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AT THAT POINT SB JEANNIE ONLY CONTROLS ABOUT THE REST OF THE DECISIONS ON WHAT GOES INTO THAT BILL WILL BE MADE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOT S. D. GMD AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT PRICING AND WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE STRUCTURE RATES THA'S A REALLY FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANT. THING THAT WE'VE GOT IT WE'VE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE WILL CONTROL ALL BILL. AND THEN FINALLY IS REALLY AROUND TECHNOLOGY SO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT SOLAR WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE SAME- GROWTH CURVE IN TERMS OF STORAGE. SO AGAIN SO NOW WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW SUBSIDIES FOR SOLAR. YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW SUBSIDIES FOR STORAGE MORE OF OUR FLUENT CUSTOMERS GOING TO BE A BEEN SOLVED BOTH OF THOSE. ALLERGY ORDERED REDUCE. MOUNT ENERGY THAT THEY FROM THE GREAT AND WHAT'S- PAYING LESS FOR THE GRID RESOURCE. ACTUALLY THERE ON STAND BY THEM. AT THAT POINT MORE YOU KNOW OUR LOOK LESS OF WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO CANNOT INSTALL SOLAR AND STORAGE THEY ARE GOING TO BE PAYING HIGHER AND HIGHER RATES SO AGAIN AS POLICY MAKERS IT'S- REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY CONSIDERED BOTH THE IN ENVIRONMENTAL- CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS THE- EQUITY CONSIDERATION SELF TAUGHT WITH THAT. THERE TO LOOK AT YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SHOULD ALL OF YOU A SURE AND ON THE VERY IMPORTANT. AND OF ALL TURN MY COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS THAT THEY MAY HAVE IT IT HAS AS YOU WERE PRESENTING I HAVE THAT THAT SENSE OF YOU KNOW FOR EVERY. NO ONE STEP FORWARD THERE WE TAKE WE'RE TAKING TWO STEPS BACK AND SO IT'S- SORT OF THIS HOW DO WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. DURING THE RESPONSE SAYING. AS WE SEE CALIFORNIA MOVING OUT VERY AGGRESSIVELY AND SETTING GOALS AND IT'S OUR PS AND- ARE WORKING HARD TO GET THERE CERTAINLY BY TWENTY THIRTY SALUTE TALENTS IN AFTER THAT BUT YOUR MAP THE DESCRIBED. THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DOCTOR. OF A SMELL- SHOWS THAT THE RATES ARE LOWER BUT THE RELY MORE ON. ALSO FUELS AND SAID. SO I GUESS I AM PART OF MY- QUESTION I pTIPPING POINT ON PRICES AND- ARE WE WERE OR ARE WE ARE THIS SIDE TIPPING. AND THE COST VERSE. THE GHG PROGRAM AND HOW WE'RE TRYING TO- CERTAINLY ADDRESS IT INCIDENT THE SECTORS WHERE IT'S CERTAINLY MOST INTENSE LIKE AND TRANSPORTATION. ARE WE GET INTO A TIPPING POINT. THANK. YEAH I I'M I'M I WE RISK WE RISK GOING BEYOND IT WE MAY BE WE MAY BE BEYOND THE TIPPING POINT I GUESS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF TIP PEOPLE BACK INTO A DIRECTION THAT THEY'VE NEVER BEEN IN TERMS OF CERTAINLY ELECTRIFY TRANSPORTATION AND- HOME HE AND- WATER HEATING. AND MAYBE WE CAN STILL DO IT BUT IT SURE IS A LOT HARDER WHEN THE- PRICES ARE AS MISALIGNED AS WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN DISCUSSING- AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE HEARD IMPLIES THAT THAT SITUATION IS PROBABLY GONNA GET WORSE UNLESS- WE START. SERIOUSLY ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF WHERE THAT MISALIGNMENT CAME FROM- I THINK IT AS WE DE CARBON EYES- BATES. IT IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON ELECTRICITY PRICES BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY THE SOLE SOURCE OF IT ESPECIALLY IF WE COULD DO THE D. CARBONIZATION AND- IN IS EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE- I THINK A LOT OF IT IS A BUNCH OF OTHER SORT OF POLICY CHOICES THAT GONNA WITH THAT THE COPS. CAN DROP WE PUT PRESSURE ON PRICES. JUST ONE ROQUE- THOUGHT- AND- MISS RADIUS- TOUCHED ON IT EARLIER WHEN. THE PRESIDENT PC WAS HERE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND- REMINDED US THAT THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AND THOSE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FOR EVERY. BILLION DOLLARS OF COST THE RATES GO UP BY 7% AGAIN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE FOR EVERY GOOD THING THEY WERE TRYING TO DO AN APPROPRIATE AS WE'VE BEEN HIT VERY HARD BY THESE WILDFIRES AND UTILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS AND NEEDING TO DO UPGRADES IN ART IN THE GRID THESE ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT THINGS CLEARING OUT. AROUND THEIR UTILITY POLES- TECHNOLOGY A LOT OF WITH SEND IT TO HAS- A SHOWN THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE ALL OF THIS WORK I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE TO REACT WE HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING- WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN IT DESCRIBED EARLIER IN TERMS OF MEETING OUR GOALS. I'M I KNOW YOU IN SOME OTHER SUGGESTION SOME SPOOKY SOLUTIONS THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF OUR POLICY BUT GIVE US SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHT SHE MIGHT HAVE ON HOW WE MIGHT. FILTER YEAH- SOME OF THESE IDEAS GOING FORWARD YEAH- WELL. THE SHERMAN THE EFFORTS FALLS RELATES TO A WILDFIRE SPENDING YOU KNOW WE WOULD RESULT VIEW THOSE DOLLARS IS BEING ADDED ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND I AND I THINK THAT AS WE'VE SEEN AND- ESPECIALLY WITH SAN DIEGO ONE BEING A RELATIVELY SMALL UTILITY COMPARED TO SUCH. AS AN IN GINNY'S SO A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS OF WHAT FIRE SAFETY INVESTMENT FOR US. IS VERY VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WORK HAVE- YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL- IN INVESTMENTS ARE GOING TO BE MADE DO YOU VIEW THOSE AS- THE CLIPPER THING IF WE IN WOULD LIKE BEING A LIVER ELECTRICITY OPERATOR CYST. PLEA IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PROUD OF THOSE DOLLARS EVEN DID AND WE THINK THAT WE NEED MORE. THAT YOU IN PERSON THE TRUCKS CAN OF STORY MUSIC FOR THE SYSTEM. PLEASE AND SEE IN ON PARTS WHERE WE START TO DIVERT FROM THE OTHER YOU TO YOU. PART BECAUSE WE BEEN MISTER. BASSMAN OUR OUR BIG COMPONENT IT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF. THIS YOU KNOW DOCTOR BUSHNELL YOU KNOW OF TRYING PUT MORE. YOU KNOW. THE EIGHT IN THE END USER INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A MECHANISM TO COLLECT THOSE DOLLARS SOMEHOW. AND REALLY IT'S JUST FROM A POLICY MECHANISM IT'S HOW ARE WE GOING TO COLLECT THOSE DOLLARS AND THOSE ARE CHOICES THAT WE MAKE THROUGH A RATE CASE IS. SOMETIMES TO THE LEGISLATURE SOMETIMES TO GO THROUGH- OTHER MECHANISMS OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- BUT IF WE CAN GET AWAY FROM HAVE BEEN MORE OF OUR COSTS VOLUMETRIC CHARGES BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU. THAT OUR CUSTOMERS DON'T LIKE HIGH BILLS WILL TO THE THING THAT THE- MORE. AND THAT IS UNEXPECTED HIGH BILLS. AND WHAT IS HER. IS SPECIALLY AS WE'VE SEEN. THAT YET- GET HOTTER SUMMERS IS THAT IT'S THOSE UNEXPECTED HIGH BILLS. THE ND THAT JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER TIME FRAME WHERE THEY HAD TO RUN YOUR AIR CONDITIONER TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY BECAUSE HUMIDITY WAS HIGH. IT WAS NINETY DEGREES HOME. AND WE HAVE ALL OVER COSTS AND DOUBLE METRO GREAT SO THIS. THEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU DID MENTION CELLPHONE SO YOU'RE PAYINGBY THE GIGA BYTE BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WATCHING A VIDEO ON FLICKS. ACTUALLY COSTS OKAY WHAT'S THE SAME THING FOR IF YOU PUT OUR CUSTOMER HAD ON IS THIS THE SAME THING FOR CUSTOMERS TO THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE REAL GOOD AWARENESS OF HOW MUCH IT COSTS. TO RUN YOUR AIR CONDITIONER TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY BUT IF YOU GOT TWO KIDS AT HOME AND THEY'RE A COMFORTABLE YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT. AND SO IF WE CAN PUT MORE COSTS MAKE A MORE FIXED TO BETTER PREDICT BUILDING LESS BILLABLE FORTY FOR CUSTOMERS YOU'RE GOOD TO HAVE. BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OVER THANK YOU. IN A- THIS CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU CAN FOR THE PRESS I WANNA GO TO YOUR COMMENT ON THAT MAKE ME DURING AND INEQUITY SO CAN YOU PUT A NUMBER IN TERMS OF- WHAT IS THE AVERAGE COST TO AN AVERAGE CALIFORNIA FAMILY WHEN IT COMES TO- SUBSIDIZING IN MANY WAYS. FAMILIES THAT ARE A BIT MORE AFFLUENT THAT HAVE SOLAR PANELS THAT ARE IN FOR THE GRID SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE OR ONE FAMILY IN PARTICULAR AND THEN WHAT IS THE ADDED SOME ACROSS THE STATE SO WE ACTUALLY ESTIMATE THIS IS A BROAD ESTIMATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. NO FOR US PRESS IN. RUMORS IF. FOR JUST PRESTIGE. SELF EVERYONE OF OUR NON CUSTOM THEY'RE PAYING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE A YEAR. TWO ONE FOUR TWO TWO HUNDRED. SUFFOLK EFFECT FOLLOW UP I DO I JUST WANT TO GET A MICROPHONE OVER YES I THINK SO THE HOUSE OF GET CLOSER THERE WE GO CHECK ONE TO GET OKAY. SO I WANT TO GET A PERSPECTIVE NOT JUST FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS BUT FOR EVERYONE THAT'S HERE THAT'S LISTED RIGHT ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA IF THE AVERAGE IS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR EXTRA THAT FAMILY SUBSIDIZING A MORE AFFLUENT CALIFORNIA RESIDENT FOR THEIR SOLAR NOT PAYING INTO THE GRID. IF WE WERE TO ADD UP SOME. ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE STATE. WHAT IS WHAT DOES THAT NUMBER LOOK LIKE. I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T PERSONALLY HAVE THAT NUMBER BUT I KNOW THAT WE COULD THAT WE YOU KNOW WE TALK TO THE OTHER UTILITIES AND FOR THAT WE COULD NOT RESPOND BACK TO YOU WITH THAT WITH. THE ISSUE OF INEQUITY ISRAEL AND I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE HELP AND HOW WE ACTUALLY WORK ON LEGISLATION THAT. SOLVE THE ISSUE OF AN EQUITY OR A- OR ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS IT. ACROSS THE STATE THANK SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IS. IS IN MY DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. UNINCORPORATED EAST LA. AND SO THAT'S MY THAT'S RIGHT COME FROM MY PURSE. BUT I'M THINKING ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF JUST. BUT IS A LOOK LIKE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE AND WHY HAVE WE- IN THE LEGISLATURE ALLOWED FOR THAT INEQUITY FOR TO HAPPEN FOR SO LONG. AND SO HOW DO WE FIX IT HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT. IS WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN. YEAH WE CAN WE CAN CERTAINLY RESPOND BACK TO YOU. I LOOK I MEAN THAT IS THE REASON WHY. ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY STATEWIDE. SELL FASTER AND- LIKE ELECTRICITY HEY WE GOTTA GET YOU GET GOOD STAFF YOURSELF- IT LOOK I MEAN YOU YOU PUT IN A SUBSIDY LIKE NAM FOR A REASON WE WANTED TO KICK START THE INDUSTRY WE WANTED TO ENCOURAGE ADOPTION AND IT'S WORKED YOU KNOW IT'S WORKED AT ME WE ARE SEEING CONTINUED GROWTH IN WITHIN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY AND WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT NOW IT THE TIME LIKE THAT FOR STATE. STARTING TO AT. PERFORMING DOING AWAY WITH THE ELIMINATING CHANGING- THIS NET ENERGY METERING POLICY AND WE THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO LOOK AS WELL SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR AND REEMPHASIZE AND JUST BASED ON NOT QUICK DATA THAT YOU JUST RECEIVED. THERE IS APPROXIMATELY TWO DOLLARS HARD WORKING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES THAT ARE SUBSIDIZING THOSE THAT ALREADY HAVE SOLAR POWER AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING THEIR FIR SHARE AND GREAT THAT RIGHT THAT THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU. EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. I AM AND IT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS NOW TELLING PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEW HOMES WE'RE CERTAINLY ABOVE AVERAGE AND THEY'RE ABLE TO BUY A HOME AT ALL PROBABLY IN THE TOP FEW PER EARNERS THEY'RE GOING TO GET MORE OF THOSE SUBSIDIES BECAUSE THE DEMANDING THAT THEY PUT ON ROOFTOPS SO. THIS IS COURSE ALSO RATING THE COST TO THE HOUSING- WHICH IS A VERY BAD THING GIVEN THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD MORE OF IT. AND. IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE WHAT I WANTED TO. ASK THE RATE THE YOU'RE NO LONGER RATE PAYER ADVOCATES YOU THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES- HAVE YOU AS PUBLIC ADVOCATES ARE TAKEN LOOK AT THIS ISSUE- OF THE- ENERGY COMMISSION. WELL FIRST OF ALL WE'VE ALREADY AGREED WE'RE GOING 2100% RENEWABLES SO WHAT QUESTION IS DO WE DO WITH THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAY WHICH IS ROOF TOP SELLER OR LESS EXPENSIVE WAYS SUCH AS OFFSHORE WIND. SOLAR FARMS IN PARTICULAR WHICH IS SEVERAL TIMES CHEAPER- HAS THE- OUR PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE LOOKED AT THIS AND- HAVE THEY TALKED WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION ABOUT THESE UNNECESSARY- COST THEY'RE PUTTING ON RATE PAYERS. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COSTS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR AND THE ENERGY MEETING SPECIFICALLY AND THE ISSUES RUN COST SHIFTING OF WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD VERY MUCH TO THE PC'S REVISIT OF THE ISSUE OF I CAN TELL YOU WE ARE ACTIVELY AS WE SPEAK WE HAVE A TEAM OF ANALYSTS. TRYING TO COME UP WITH OPTIONS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT COST BURDEN OKAY BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S MANDATE TO MAKE THE SITUATION EVEN WORSE. HI YOU HAVE OU TALKED WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION ABOUT. REALLY YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT THE COSTS THAT YOU PUT ON CUSTOMERS. WITH WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT THE WELL I THINK YOU SHOULD I THINK THAT'S PART OF YOUR- MANDATE. ARM THAT YOU ARE THE ADVOCATES FOR THE RATE PAYERS AND THIS HELPS NO ONE EXCEPT THE FEW PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO BUY NEW HOMES TODAY. NEW SO FAMILY HOMES THE TOP FEW PERCENT OF EARNERS AND I JUST DON'T THAT APPROPRIATE WAY AN APPROACH POLICY. THEOTHER POLICY AND PERHAPS DOCTOR BUSH NOW ONLY ALL YOU CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. ARM BECAUSE I KNOW YOU YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE PEOPLE DOING THIS RESEARCH AND YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS. THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT. THE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING ON ENERGY CONSERVATION. OUR IS NOT PAYING OFF IN THE WAY THE CALCULATIONS TALUS. THIS PROBABLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT AN UNINSULATED BUILDING IS SIMPLY A BETTER INSULATOR THAN WE THINK SO WHEN YOU ADD IN THE NATION IT MAKES LESS OF A DIFFERENCE THAT'S AT LEAST ONE OF THE THEORIES. UP BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK BY THE M. I. T. YOU SEE- CHICAGO GROUP ON THIS LOOKING AT MID WESTERN STATES BUT WE ALSO HAVEINFORMATION ARE OUT LOOKING AT FOLLOW UP HERE TO THE WORK WE'RE DOING. WHERE THE COST OF GAS EXCUSE ME THE REDUCTIONS IN GAS USAGE OR TWO OR THREE TIMES LESS THAN WE EXPECT. OUR ELECTRICITY. HAVE YOU HAVE YOU TAKEN A LOOK AT THIS. SO I AM NOT ONE OF THE- PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THOSE STUDIES I AM CERTAINLY FAMILIAR WITH THEM- AND THE AYE THE STUDY TO REFERRING TO THERE'S A GENERAL SORT OF SET OF ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO DO THINGS LIKE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS AROUND ENERGIZED AGENCY PROGRAMS TO TRY TO. TO MEASURE THE IMPACT AND A BIT MORE RIGOROUS WAY AND THE GENERAL THEME RESULTS IS BEEN LESS EFFECTIVE THAN WHAT THE OF STAND ENGINEERING ESTIMATES GOING IN WITH EXPECT AND SOME IS A LOT LESS EFFECTIVE- IT DOES. THE CALL- THIS DISCUSSION TO THOSE COSTS ARE ALSO IN THE VARIABLE COMPONENT OF RATES AS WELL TO PAY FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. ALIENS A YEAR AND- AND AGAIN THERE ARE- THESE ARE COSTS THAT ARE NOT- CONTRIBUTED TO NEARLY AS MUCH BY SOLAR HOMES FOR EXAMPLE- BECAUSE OF THOSE COSTS BEING PART OF THE VARIABLE RATE COMPONENTS. SO ITS THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF ELEMENTS OF COST SHIFTS GOING ON WITHIN JUST FUNDING FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS I THINK. SINCE ABOUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH SHOULD BE APPROACHED THE IMPLEMENTING THOSE PROGRAMS AND IS ALSO REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD TRY TO FUND THE PROGRAM IS ALL AT LEAST THE ONES THAT WE THINK ARE. ARE AFFECTED. YEAH SO NOT ALL. I REMEMBER I HAD WORK DONE ON MY OWN HOME AND THEY TOLD ME TO ADD MORE INSULATION FOR MY TO MY CEILING WHEN I HEARD ALREADY OUR THIRTY SIX ARE THEY TOLD ME TO PUT INSULATION UNDERNEATH MY HOME WHEN THE HOME WAS ALREADY WELL INSULATED FROM WIND AND- HAVE THE FURNISHED DOWN THERE IT'S DIRECT. AND TO SO I PUT IN PLACE SHOULD UNDER HOW SUB INTO MORE IN THE US BASICALLY I GOT NO- ENERGY SAVINGS- AND- THAT WAS VERY DISTURBING TO ME AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY HAPPENING A LOT. NOW GET PEOPLE HAVE DATA WHICH CONSERVATION EFFORTS HAVE THE BIGGEST PAY OFFS I KNOW BERKELEY HAS LOOKED AT THIS AND THEY CAN TELL YOU- WHICH WEAPONS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE WHICH ONES ARE LEAKED EFFECT OF. AND I THAT IS THIS IS IN A AREA AGAIN FOR THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES TO LOOK. THAT WE OUGHT TO BE SPENDING MONEY ON THE THINGS THAT WORK AND NOT MONEY ON THE THINGS THAT DON'T WORK. I YES I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOU AND WE DO DO THAT WORK IN TERMS OF. WHEN E SEE. PROPOSALS COME IN THE DOOR THE PC. AND WE ACTUALLY MONITOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY RT BEING. SUPPORTED BUT WITH A PAIR FUNDING WE ARE TRACKING THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH INCLUDES ARE THOSE PROGRAMS WORKING ARE THEY DEMONSTRATING REAL BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC AND TO RATEPAYERS AND THERE'S A LOT OF. IT OUT THERE FRANKLY RIGHT THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT THAT ARE NOT COST EFFECTIVE THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE OVERALL. HAVE YOU LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT SOME OF THE ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM WE HAVE LOOKED WE HAVE AN ARE LOOKING AT ENERGY EFFICIENCY SPECIFICALLY AND WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THERE. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. AND IF I MAY THE ONE OTHER- MAP THAT I DIDN'T INCLUDE IN MY PRESENTATION THAT IS A BIT FRUSTRATING IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY EXPENDITURE ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED ON THE COASTS WHERE EXACTLY THE PLACES WHERE THE PRICES ARE. MAY EXTREMELY OVER PRICED- WHICH IS PROBABLY THE LAST PLACE YOU WANT TO BE TRYING TO SUBSIDIZE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS OPPOSED AS PARTS OF MIDDLE OF THE CALL YEAH THAT'S THAT'S VERY TRUE BECAUSE IT'S THE PEOPLE ON THE COAST WHO CAN AFFORD. TO ADD THE INSULATION AT CETERA AND YES THAT WAS ALSO ONE OF THE FINDINGS. WHEN WE LOOKED AROUND PROGRAM UP FINAL THING IS. TALK ABOUT FIXED COSTS. NOW I COULD ARGUE HAVE THIS HUGE VERY EXPENSIVE ON BUT I'M USING LEDS IN ITS NEW BE. ARM BILL SO I AM USING. MAYBE EVEN LESS ELECTRICITY THAN A MUCH SMALLER AND YET. WE IT'S VERY IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO A FIXED COST BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME LINE COMING OUT HOUSE IS BEING EVERYBODY WHO HAS A LINE WHETHER IT'S- COUPLE. SQUARE FOOT TINY HAPS OR A FOUR THOUSAND- HOW SOME OF THESE- SIXTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT MANSIONS. THEY HAVE A LINE COMING OUT TO THEIR HOUSE IN THE CASE OF SIXTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT MANSION THEY MIGHT HAVE US A BIGGER LINED BUT- BY AND LARGE BETWEEN THE FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE THE FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOUSE. THE GONNA GET THE SAME LINE. YET IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE JUST BECAUSE OF EQUITY CONCERNS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE SAME THING CHARGE. ON THE OTHER HAND THE PERSON WITH THE FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE THAT'S MORE RECENT BELT AND THEREFORE AND- IT'S MORE FISH. WITH THEM A LADY'S FREEWARE IT SAT AROUND. ARM MAY PASS COOLEY. TERMS PASSIVE ET. ARE THEY MY NOT BE THAT MUCH MORE THAN THE SMALLER. SO CAN I. DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS. ANYONE HERE KNOW THOSE HOW TO DO A FIXED PRICE IN EQUITY WAY ARE FIX CHARGING EQUITABLE WAY THEY SHOULD SPEAK UP. I DON'T. HAVE A SOLUTION I DO WANT TO AGREE WITH YOUR OBSERVATIONS- AND I ALSO THINK THAT THEY APPLY TO LOW USAGE CUSTOMERS. IN THAT FIGHT- SO I THINK YOU'RE ASKING THE SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR QUESTION AND ULTIMATELY IF YOU ASK ANYBODY IN THE INDUSTRY WHO WORKS IN THIS SPACE YOU'RE GONNA GET. ON TEN TEN DIFFERENT ANSWERS- BUT WE DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT- IF YOU LOOK KIND OF OUT INTO THE FUTURE AND AT THE SIDE MY COMMENTS EARLIER AROUND- NOT JUST MAYBE A SPECIFIC FIX CHARGE BUT REALLY MOVING MORE. ENERGY PRICING IS KIND OF A FIX SUBSCRIPTION BASIS. WHERE YOU COULD DESIGN RATES IN A WAY THAT TAKES THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WHETHER IT'S BY. A AUDIT CAPACITY BASIS MEANING HOW MUCH ENERGY ARE YOU ACTUALLY SUING- IN YOUR HOME COULD YOU- COULD YOU SCALE UP BASED UPON YOU THE SIZE YOUR HOME OR YOU KNOW DON'T. ENERGY USAGE COULD YOU RESET THAT EVERY YEAR BASED UPON HOW MUCH YOU USE AND COULD YOU ALSO HAVE MEANS TESTED SO MEANING WE STILL HAVE WE STILL COULD PUT IN PLACE- DISCOUNTS FOR OUR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS AS WELL SO. I THINK IT MAY. SEE YOU TAPE SCRIPT SHIN KICKS LIKE ME BUT ALL IN A- HE ANY POP THAT ONE TO. YOU KNOW CORD. CUSTOM WELL BUT AGAIN THE RICH GUY WITH CELL IS FOR NAY EVEN ELECT. BILL RIGHT WELL YOU HAVE ONE BUT DON'T PAY VERY MUCH YOU COULD NOT BEAR AGAIN THAT WOULD ASSUME YOU'RE ALSO REFORMING THAT ENERGY METERING AND YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT KIND OF THE TRUE CONSUMPTION OF THE HOME. AND NOT JUST HOW UNIT NETTING OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WHAT YOU'RE PAYING US TO JENNY AND WHAT YOU'RE GENERATING WITHIN YOUR PANELS. DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT. FOR PUBLIC ADVOCATE SIDE TOO I JUST WANT TO I WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO LOOK AT FIX CHARGES AS A PANACEA OF FOR HIGH RATES OF AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO A COMMENT I MADE EARLIER ABOUT LOOKING AT CUSTOMERS BILLS AND THE CONCERN THAT THAT YOU YOU EXPRESSED OF DOVETAILS WITH ANOTHER CONCERN WHICH IS WHEN I SAY LOW USAGE CUSTOMERS I'M TALKING ABOUT CUSTOMERS WHO USE BELOW AT AT THE BASE LINE. LOWER QUANTITY UP ELECTRICITY THAT THEY COULD BE HIT WITH HIGH FIXED. CHARGES SEE HOW TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW YOU STRUCTURE SOETHING LIKE THAT. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A MINIMUM BILL TO TAKE CARE OF THE SITUATION WHERE A CUSTOMER PAYS. A MODEST MINIMUM BILL OF FOR A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF ENERGY. WE THINK THAT. THAT IS A BETTER WAY TO GO AND IT DOESN'T PENALIZE LOW USAGE CUSTOMERS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AT THIS TIME IF NOT I'M GOING TO TURN TO THE PUBLIC IF OUR PANELISTS CAN JUST REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE WILL. TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT- AND THEN WE'LL TURN BACK TO MEMBERS IF THEY HAVE ANY OTHER THOUGHT THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SHARE AT THAT TIME SO WILL. WELCOME THOSE WHO WERE. I WANTED TO SHARE A THOUGHT. GOT ABOUT A MINUTE TWO MINUTES AT THE MOST. PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES CESSATION ONE I THINK THAT CHAIR AND COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. WE AGREE WITH THAT ELECTRIC AFFORDABILITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH RELIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY IS REALLY CRITICAL I WAS MENTIONED IN THE LA AS WE ARE BY MISTER BROWN THAT WAS DISCUSSED HERE THAT ELECTRICITY PRICES IF THEY'RE HIGHER COULD BE A BARRIER TO FUTURE GHG REDUCTIONS WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT CONCLUSION. THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY HE SAID HIMSELF THAT. ELECTRICITY IS THE ARCHITECTURE OF TRANSFORMING THE TRANSPORTATION FLEET WHERE 41% OF THE MISSIONS ARE SO CERTAINLY WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT RATES FOR HIS BILL. TEAMMATES PERSPECTIVE WE THINK RATES AND BILLS MATTER AT CALIFORNIA IS A VERY GEOGRAPHICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DIVERSE STATE- ARBORS BE A FORTY FIVE MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE AND YOU KNOW WHERE IT ONE STATE AT A BILL MIGHT BE LEFT ANOTHER PART OF THIS MY BEHIND SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. EIGHT BILLS TOGETHER I DON'T THINK WE CAN THEM IN SILOS. I AM JUST IT AND NOW IT'S JUST ABOUT. WAS THAT IT TODAY WAS ON I OWE YOU BATES JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE. FOR THE MUNICIPAL AS WELL- BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. YOU RESIDENTIAL RATES ROSE BY RISING Q. U. RATES NATIONWIDE- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BASED ON AVERAGES APPEAR YOU RESIDENTIAL BILLS TWENTY WAS NINETY TWO DOLLARS. BUT NATIONALLY THE AVERAGE BILL WITH SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA. DESPITE THE RISE IN RATES. USE THAT HAVE- A 15% LOWER THAN I OWE YOU RATE. WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THEM LAW BUT THE TO. LA JUST MANDATE IS IN TRANSMISSION ACCESS ANOTHER PRESSURE. ABOUT AND WE NEED TO SEE. CAUGHT SIZE ALSO THE ELECTRIC SECTORS ON AND RIGHT I THINK THE TOUCH. BETWEEN TWENTY ELEVEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN GHG REDUCTIONS FROM THE MISSION SECTOR 30% TRANSPORTATION SECTOR EMISSIONS ACTUALLY ROSE THINK ELECTRIC SECTOR WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND ALSO HELP ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS IN OTHER SECTORS LIKE TRANSPORTATION BUT AFFORDABILITY MUST REMAIN FRONT AND CENTER WE NEED TO FOCUS ON COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. AND MAINTAINING PLANNING FLEXIBILITY IS FOR UTILITIES TO THE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS A FOR TODAY'S TO REALLY PREPARE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON GERALD AND ALEX JACKSON WITH AN RTC I AM ONE OF THOSE ENVIRONMENTALISTS TODAY DR BUSHNELL'S POINT BUT I AGREE THAT THE ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE TOO DARN HIGH TODAY AND SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE HAMPERED PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY IN OUR ABILITY TO ELECTRIFY MORE AND USES IF WE MAKE THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY PROHIBITIVELY EXENSIVE AT THE SAME TIME. WILDFIRES IS MAKING IT LESS RELY SO WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER ONE REASON PEOPLE BUY ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS THE FUEL COST SAVINGS RELATIVE TO GASOLINE- SO AGAIN IF TO PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE WE SEE REAL APPAREL FOR OUR ELECTRIFICATION AGENDA- AGREE WITH ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU FOR TODAY- SHOULD BE LOOKED TO TAKE THINGS OUT OF THE RATE BASE THAT DON'T REALLY HAVE TO BE A READ EITHER. PROGRAMS WITH ON THE STATE BUDGET. AND SIR. I'M DIGGING A HOLE NOT MAKE IT IN WORSE BUT- I ONE HUNDRED WHAT WE SEE IS A REAL. MOVING FORWARD IN THE EXPLODING COSTS POTENTIALLY IN RATES AND THAT IS FIRE MITIGATION. AS YOU NOTED EVERY BILLION DOLLARS FROM P. GENIES EXPERIENCES- 7% BILL INCREASE. THEY RECENTLY FILED THEIR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS PROPOSING TO SPEND. SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS SO DO THE MATH AND THAT'S COMPLETELY NOT SUSTAINABLE UNDER TRADITIONAL. RATE MAKING SO WE REALLY WANT ENCOURAGED THIS BOBBY TO THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE FINANCE. SYSTEM HARDENING USED. FOR SAVE LIABILITY. OUTSIDE OF LET GRADES. THROUGH OTHER SOURCES OR OTHER WAYS OF NANCY DOESN'T. IMPACT NOW THIS BILL SWEEPING TO ELECTRICITY AND ARE CLEAN AND RELIABLE ENERGY SOURCE. AND I'LL TO LEAVE YOU WITH SOME OF. YOU COULD THINK ABOUT YOU NEED TO CONVINCE YOU THIS MR HOLE BUT I. AFTER EVERYONE THAT WE COULD. ABOUT WAYS TO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN OUR WESTERN GRIP- WE THINK WE'VE SEEN THE- DEMONSTRATED SAVINGS FROM THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET THE SAVINGS THAT PROVIDES TO CUSTOMERS WE- CONTINUE TO THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS AS WE LOOK AT. HIGHER RISK POOL OF PRETTY. EDUCATION STATE. BUT THE OTHER ONE. LEAVE YOU WITH IS THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS DYSTOPIAN FUTURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE WE'RE LETTING. CLIMATE NEWS WILDFIRES MAKE OUR LOOKS. MORE PENSIVE LESS RELIABLE MEANS OF THE CARLO TING. POSITIVE STORY THE MORE WE AND BETTER ACTUALLY. AND VEHICLE. IS A PUTS DOWN PRESSURE ON RATES FOR EVERYBODY AND WE JUST PUT A STUDY OUT. THE ELECTRICITY JOURNAL THE LOOK AT P. GINNY SERVICE TERRITORY. IF THEY DID SMART OCCASION AND THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY THEY COULD REDUCE. COST IMPACT FROM WILDFIRE. 28% DOWN TO NINE PERCENT. SO THESE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO MAKE HAPPEN WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ENABLE EDUCATION BOTH AS A CARBON STRATEGY AND IS AFFORDABILITY STRATEGY THANK. THANK YOU.
