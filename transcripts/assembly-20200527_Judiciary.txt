THE MASS SKATE FACE MAX GOOD FOR THE NEW SYSTEM MS WICKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER. AN URBAN INSTITUTE REPORT FROM DECEMBER NINETEENTH SORRY DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN ESTIMATED 26% OF CALIFORNIANS HAD A DEAD IN COLLECTION. SINCE THE START OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUMPED FROM FIVE POINT 5% TO RECORD FIFTEEN POINT 5% IN APRIL. WITH FOUR POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS. THEREFORE WITH A COVER NINETEEN CRISIS MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO MAY ALREADY BE IN DEBTS WILL FIND THEMSELVES AND EVEN MORE HARDSHIP. WITH THE INCREASE FINANCIAL STRUGGLE SOME LOW INCOME CONSUMERS AND HOMEOWNERS MAY ALSO FACE THE THREAT OF LOSING THEIR HOMES. THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER COMPLETED A REPORT THAT INVESTIGATED A PROCESS THE CREDITORS HAVE BEEN. SEEKING FOR CLOSURES ON HOMES FOR JUDGMENTS BASED ON UNSECURED DEBT. THIS REPORT FROM THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER FOUND THAT THESE CREDITORS HAVE BEEN FOR CLOSING HOMES BASED ON SMALL AMOUNTS OF DEBT. IN PARTICULAR THIS PRACTICE HAS BEEN AFFECTING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE PRACTICE OF COURSE FOR CLOSING ON HOMES BASED ON SMALL AMOUNTS OF UNSECURED DEBT IS PROBLEMATIC GIVEN THE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES EMERGING FROM THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND EXACERBATES EXISTING HOUSING HOMELESSNESS CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY THREE WILL ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA WILL NOT LOSE THEIR HOMES. AS THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR DEBTS ESPECIALLY DURING THE COPA NINETEEN CRISIS. THIS BILL WILL PREVENT FORECLOSURES ON A PERSON'S PRINCIPAL PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND PREVENT THE FOR THE ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS. STAKEHOLDERS TO RAISE QUESTIONS REGARDING DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL. AND WE'VE HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO ALLEVIATE ANY ADDITIONAL CONCERNS. CALIFORNIA THERE ARE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY RIGHT NOW MORE THAN EVER- NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO THE MOST VULERABLE BY ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WERE FACING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. CAN KEEP THEIR HOMES. THIS BILL HAS BEEN- SUPPORTED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF CONSUMER GROUPS. THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY THE CALIFORNIA REALTORS ASSOCIATION AND AMONG OTHERS- AND I WOULD RESPECT FASTER I THOUGHT. THANK YOU THIS WORKS WE HAVE. TWO WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT MIGUEL SOTO AND DOCTOR PRASAD KRISHNAMOORTHY AND MY THIS IS BOTH THERE ON THE TELEPHONE BUT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOMEONE IN A REMOTE. VIDEO ROOM. OKAY SO DO WE HAVE MISTER SOTO OR- DR KRISHNAMOORTHY ON THE PHONE. YEAH OKAY PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SET UP AND A STAFF ATTORNEY IN CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR AT THE FIFTY LAWCENTER WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME TO A COALITION OUR CLINIC DIRECTOR UNDER THE CONSUMERS EACH YEAR WITH THAT COLLECTION MATTERS I THINK WITH MANY HOMEOWNERS ARE LOW INCOME AND MOSTLY SENIORS IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO IS GOOD FOR SMALL AND TO GET THAT. POP UP IN CREDIT CARD WITHOUT THIS AROUND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MANY OF THE SOMEONE OR SUCH TROUBLE PER MONTH ANYTHING YEAR TO PAY BACK THAT WITH MORE THAN ONE CALL KEEPING THE OPEN MEDICAL CARE TO REPAY A LOAN BECAUSE OF HIGH INTEREST RATE THE IMPACT ON FEET. NEVER CATCH UP AND IT. TOO WHEN IT. THE WAY TO. OTHER BIG HELP MAKE LEVY BUT EVERY QUITE OPEN ACOSTA QUESTIONS CAN I USE MY HOME I CAN'T BY THE MONEY TO PAY THIS THAT. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO KILL THE PEOPLE THAT YES THE FAMILY MIGHT LOSE THE WHOLE OVER THE HUNDRED UTILITY BILL. FOR THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR CARD TO. A COMPUTER BECAUSE IT UNNECESSARY. BELIEVE THE HARMFUL TO SEE BY HOME. LIKE PICKING UP AT THE- LONG NEVER. RETIRED SCHOOL TEACHERS CAN'T PATIENT. UNDOCUMENTED FAST FOOD WORKERS AND OTHER VOLATILE HOMEOWNERS WHO HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE RIGHT NOW. CALIFORNIA AFFECTED LET ANY UNDERTAKEN TO MAKE THAT ACT LIKE A MORTGAGE. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY PREFIX OF THIS AND JUSTICE. A QUESTION MARK THE WILL EXPLAIN HOW BILLS PAID LENDERS AND LEAVE THEM OTHER WAYS. A COLLECTED THAT. I'M HERE TO EXPECT UNNECESSARY THIS BILL IS TO MAKE SURE WE PROTECT OUR HOMEOWNERS WHO LIVE IN THE HOME BECAUSE THE MEDICAL BUILDING AT THE FORT. FOR A LONG PRO CARD DOES NOT AB POSSESSING AUCTIONED OFF. I'M HERE TO SHARE THE HOPE OF EVERY PEOPLE LIKE THAT NUMBER THE NEXT TIME IF PEOPLE CAN MOTHER ACT BUT IF YOU CAN BE EVICTED ELLEN PAGE THE CARD THAT. YOU CAN FIND A LOOK IN THE EYE AND SAY NO. YOUR HOME IS SAFE. WE ARE DRIVE HOME. THANK YOU. DOC CHRISTIAN MURPHY. I THANK YOU MY NAME IS WITHOUT QUESTION WITH THE AND I AM A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW WHERE I TEACH AND CONDUCT RESEARCH IN THE AREAS OF FINANCIAL REGULATION AND CONTRACT LBGT FROM THE A LAW SCHOOL TO PHD IN ECONOMICS FROM THE UC BERKELEY DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS IN MY RESEARCH HAS BEEN PUBLISHED. IN LEADING JOURNALS AND LAW AND ECONOMICS I BELIEVE THAT AB TWO FOUR SIX THREE WILL MAKE CONSUMERS BETTER OFF- FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT MIGUEL EXPLAINED IT WILL HELP JUDGMENT DEBTORS TO KEEP THEIR HOMES IN THIS IS AN ESPECIALLY TIED THE CONCERN- AT CALIFORNIA'S CAME INTO THIS CRISIS WITH THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA DEBT TOTALS IN THE COUNTRY AND CURRENTLY HOUSEHOLD BORROW TO REPLACE LOST INCOME. IN THE MIDST OF COLD AT NINETY. SECONDLY AB TWO FOUR TWO FOUR SIX THREE UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY APPRECIABLE EFFECT. ON CREDIT MARKETS OVERALL AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE OVERALL NUMBER OF FOR SALE OUTSIDE OF. TRADITIONAL FOR COOK FORECLOSURE AND BANKRUPTCY IS VERY SMALL IF YOU LOOK AT THE EAST PLEASE TAKE MANY DOCTORS REPORT. IT'S ON THE ORDER OF SEVERAL HUNDRED A YEAR. WHEREAS THERE ARE ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND FORECLOSURES AND ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND BANKRUPTCY FILING IN CALIFORNIA THE LITTLE IN IN IN IN A GIVEN YEAR. SO THIS IS A VERY SMALL LITTLE UP LOOK AT THE PARK FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE OVERALL CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND OF COURSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE WHO WHO UNDERGO. ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE RIGHT OF MORTGAGE AND ALL THOSE OTHER SECURED LENDERS. ARE COMPLETELY UNAFFECTED ARE MOSTLY UNAFFECTED. AS WE ARE THE RIGHT THE UNSECURED LENDERS IN THE TRADITIONAL FORECLOSURE OR IN A BANKRUPTCY SO ALL PROJECTS THAT THE KIND OF. ACT AND YOUR BEFORE WITH A BIT OF THE FOR THE ACTION EFFECTS ON CREDIT MARKETS ARE LIKELY TO BE SMALL. FINALLY A TWO FORTY THREE PRESERVES THE RIGHT TO SEEK A COURT ORDERED SALE FOR OTHER CREDITORS BUT DID PORT AND AFTER THE VICTIM SO THEIR RIGHTS ARE UNAFFECTED. THE GOOD AT WHAT WE TYPICALLY DO NOT RESEARCH THAT ABOUT WHAT AB TWO FOUR SIX THREE LIKELY EFFECTS WILL BE- WE- GENERALLY LOOK TO- PAPERS THAT STUDY EFFECTIVE INCREASES IN THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. IN THE QUEUE AND ACT LOOKS PLAYED WHAT THE GOOD AT THE ELEGY. IF WE TAKE THAT HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION RESEARCH AB TWO FOUR SIX THREE IS LIKELY TO ACTUALLY INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ON SECURE CREDIT. THAT THE TEAM BY CONSUMERS. AND INCREASE WILL BE LARGEST FOR LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS. AND THE REASON WHY IS THAT AB TWO TO FOUR SIXTY WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE CREDIT DEMAND AMONG BORROWERS. WHO VALUE THE INSURANCE THAT IT PROVIDES. AND THE EXISTING EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THIS DEMAND AFFECT OUTWEIGH ANY SUPPLY BACKED. UP TO THE- BY LENDERS. AB FOUR SIX THREE I'D LIKE LOW FLUX. IN CONSUMER EXPAND THE OF TIME IN THINK ABOUT THE SIMPLY IN THE EVENT OF A FORCED HOMES HELP THAT WOULD NORMALLY HAPPEN UNDER EXISTING LAW THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN CONSUMERS WILL BE ABLE TO STAND. UP SPEND MORE ON THE SHELVES. THIRDLY AB TWO FOUR SIX WITH UNLIKELY THE FACT DELINQUENCY THAT ALL IN UNSECURED MARKETS. IT MAY HAVE A SMALL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES FOR SOME SAID OF BORROWERS. AND FINALLY AB TWO FOUR SIX THREE UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY EFFECT AT ALL ON TO CHURCH MARKETS IS IN NO AFFECT ON INTEREST RATES NO AFFECT ON CLEVELAND SEIZE. UPPER HOUSING AUTOMOBILES AND OTHER CONSUMER DURABLES. UP FINALLY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE JUST BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PORTS HOME SALES OUTSIDE A FORECLOSURE A BANKRUPTCY A SMALL ALL OF THE FACT. THAT THEY DO EXIST. ARE LIKELY TO BE VERY SMALL. THESE REASONS I BELIEVE. WE BETTER OFF AS A RESULT OF AB TO FORCE THREE. AND I. BECAUSE THAT YOU GO A THIS BILL. THANK YOU.

ONE MAN THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION TWELVE EIGHTEEN AND AUTHORIZED PROBATION AS A SENTENCING OPTION IN FAMILY COURT CONTEMPT CASES. AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT OFFERED THE SAME SENTENCING OPTION OF PROBATION ADNAN MISDEMEANOR AND CRIMINAL CONTEMPT CASES UNDER THE PENAL CODE. IT WILL REDUCE COSTS FOR COURT STAFFING COUNSEL FEES AND COSTS OF INCARCERATION BY ALLOWING FOR PLEA AGREEMENTS TO OCCUR IN LIEU OF TRIAL THIS IS GOOD FOR BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENSE. A GIVE JUDGES THE DISCRETION TO LOOK AT THE REASONING WHY FOR EXAMPLE APPARENTLY UNABLE TO PAY SUPPORT PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF A JOB.

IT HAS SEVEN VOTE THAT BILL IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT WE WILL NOW- LET'S SEE MR CHOW ARE YOU READY ON AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO SO WE OPERATOR OF THE LINES FOR AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO PLEASE. GIVE THE LINE TO HELP WITH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO WOULD REQUIRE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THIS CLOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A POLICY TO ADDRESS THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. CURRENTLY DEFINED TO INCLUDE INFORMATION WHICH IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING INACCURATE COORDINATED AND DECEPTIVE PROMOTION OR SUPPRESSION OF INFORMATION AND PRACTICES INTENDED TO MANIPULATE THE- OF USERS. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THAT VIOLATE THIS LAW WOULD HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO REMEDY THEIR VIOLATION. ACCORDING TO THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER IN NEWS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. IN YET ANOTHER REPORT THEY FOUND THAT DESPITE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING FAKE NEWS 73% OF US ADULTS CONTINUE TO RELY ON GETTING NEWS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. WHAT IS MORE STE WHAT IS MORE TROUBLING IS THAT APPROXIMATELY STORY FOUND OUT LATER THAT THE NEWS STORY WAS FALSE. AS THE CLOVER NINETEEN CRISIS CONTINUES TO UNFOLD MANY INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALREADY BEEN HIT WITH IN- MISINFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE VIRUS IS SPREAD. ALL OFFERING TO SELL MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO FIGHT AGAINST THE VIRUS. MORE MORE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN SOCIAL MEDIA CAN SPREAD MORE MISINFORMATION BELIEVING IT TO BE TROUBLED. CREATING A VICIOUS CYCLE. ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS EARLY IN THE YEARINFORMATION ABOUT CLOVER NINETEEN WAS SCARCE LEADING TO A DATE AVOID UNFORTUNATELY DEVOID WAS QUICKLY FILL WOULD PROBLEMATIC CONTENT. BY BAD ACTORS EAGER TO EXPLOIT THE SITUATION. BY REQUIRING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO DISCLOSE WHAT THEY WHAT ARE THEY HOW SUCH A POLICY THE USERS AND THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASSESS THE INFORMATION THEY ARE CONSUMING. CURRENTLY MANY PLATFORM TO NOT HAVE SUCH A POLICY DEALING WITH MISINFORMATION. SINCE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF WHOLE ADULT CONSUME NEWS IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHICH OF THESE PLATFORMS ARE. TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO DOES THAT. I HAVE PROFESSOR EMERITUS JOHN SIMS FROM THE GEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW AND EXPERT ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW HERE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YES NO POSITION ON A BILL THAT CAN SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. RIGHT THANK YOU WE WILL MOVE THEN TO PROFESSOR SINCE WHO IS WITH US AND OUR WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM. GOOD MORNING- THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROVIDE STRONG PROTECTION FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. AND TO A DEGREE IT ALSO. PROVIDES PROTECTION. TO THOSE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT'S TRYING TO COMPEL SPEECH- AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO S. DESCRIBED WOULD REQUIRE EACH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM TO DISCLOSE WHETHER IT HAS A POLICY TO DEAL WITH. SYSTEMATIC SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. I IN MY VIEW NO SUBSTANTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION CAN BE RAISED ABOUT THIS ASPECT OF AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO. ARE THERE ARE MANY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AFTER A COUPLE TO THOSE PROVIDING GOODS AND SERVICES IN FIRST AMENDMENT LAW ACCEPTS IT DID THIS EVERY DAY PROCESS OF REGULATION WHICH PROTECTS AGAINST FLOP FRAUD EXPLOITATION AND OTHER INJURIES. FOR EXAMPLE I IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED A CASE CALLED SOUTER. OF WHICH CONCLUDED THAT AN ATTORNEY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES RELATED TO HIS PROVISION OF SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND HE HAD TO MAKE THOSE DISCLOSURES TO PROSPECTIVE. CLIENTS SIMILARLY IN CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS ARE REQUIRED IN AND IN NUMEROUS WAYS TO MAKE AFFIRMATIVE DISCLOSURES SO FOR EXAMPLE UNDER RULE ONE POINT FOUR POINT TWO CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE TO PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS IN ALMOST ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE. MALPRACTICE INSURANCE. HI EVERYONE A CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIAR- WITH THE UBIQUITOUS STUFF PROP SIXTY FIVE WARNING SOME OF WHICH ARE REQUIRED. OF THOSE- SELLING SERVICES- AND GOODS WHEN THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE- CONSUMERS TO DANGEROUS CHEMICALS. SO THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT PREVENT CONSUMER PROTECTION DISCARDED PROTECTION DISCLOSURES OF THESE TYPES. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT IF ANY FIRST AMENDMENT. ARGUMENT WERE RAISED- ALONG THE LINES OF THE COMPELLED SPEECH DR AGAINST AB TWENTY FOUR FOUR TWO THAT THAT CLAIM WOULD BE REJECTED THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU HAD MR TELL THE- ANALYSIS LISTS A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. HI THAT'S CORRECT UP. ARE THERE IS A SET OF AMENDMENTS ACT OUT I AM ACCEPTING A GRANDMA HERE AND- YEAH I'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING WITH THE ALL THE OPPOSITION AND STAKEHOLDERS ON FURTHER AMENDING THE LANGUAGE AND YOU KNOW TO TAKE A LOOK. THE DEFINITION OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM AS WELL AS THE DEFINITION OF MISINFORMATION SO THOSE AMENDMENTS WILL GO AND LATER. ON BUT THE MEMBERS ARE SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS ARE YOU ALWAYS WILL BE ACCEPTED TODAY OKAY CORRECT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ALL RIGHT CA NINETY MIGHT BE EDITION ALL CALLERS YEAH TO SUPPORT. YEAH I WOULD ANYONE ON THE LINES. LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO. IF YOU'RE INTO PART WITH FEDERAL ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME LINE FORTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. AGAIN NINE FORTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MOVING ON TO LINE THIRTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. LINE THIRTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN. OKAY AT THE TIME IF YOU ARE IN. THE FACT ONE ZERO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. THERE ARE NO OTHER SECURE. OKAY THANKYOU IS THERE OPPOSITION I HAVE ONE LISTED OPPOSITION SAMANTHA CORBIN FROM ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. I'M ON THE LINE IF YOU CAN HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'VE MET THE CORPORATE ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. RESPECTFULLY AND OPPOSITION AB. TWO FOUR FOUR TWO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CUTS ON CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUES- WITH THE LANGUAGE IN PARTICULAR- THAT THE DEFINITION OUR OBJECTIVE AND OVERLY BROAD. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORED OFFICE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AND APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TO CONSIDER. ME THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE NINE TWO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO. IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE DO HAVE PEOPLE QUEUING UP IT'LL BE A MOMENT. THANK YOU. I WOULD PROVIDE THE LIGHT NUMBERS. MY NUMBER TWENTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU THIS IS ROBERT CAL AND WITH THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION- WE OPPOSE THE BILL. EIGHT NO THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO WORK WITH US MOVING FORWARD- BUT IT PRINT WE DO BELIEVE AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO IS UNNECESSARY- THE MOST WIDELY USED SOCIAL MEDIA. PLATFORMS A COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE STRICT RULES AND POLICIES ABOUT WHAT IS AND IS NOT ALLOWED ON THEIR PLATFORMS IN THESE ROLES ALREADY DRESSED WAYS PLATFORMS APPROACH- BERRIES FORMS OF MISINFORMATION AND MANIPULATION OF THE SITE- THAT AS FAR AS- BEING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THEY ARE. NOT DISCUSSED AT LENGTH ON PAGES DEVOTED TO THESE RULES AND POLICIES AND ARE AVAILABLE TO BE VIEWED AT ANY TIME BY USERS- PERSPECTIVE USERS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC- SO- WE ARE BECAUSE OF THE BILL- AS WE BELIEVE IT'S NOT NECESSARY BUT IT SHOULD. OF THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OFFICE. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY FURTHER TESTIMONY IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. LINE FORTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HELLO CAMERA DIMITRI WITH TECHNOLOGY WE ARE ALSO RESPECTFULLY BECAUSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO OTHER CHEN Q. THANK YOU OPERATOR I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THAT. THIS HIGHLY. I'M MISTER SHOW USED MENTIONED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A- AMENDMENT THE CHANGES THE DEFINITION OF MISINFORMATION WHAT IS ONE OF THEM TELL. ART WELL THE DETAILS ARE STILL BEING WORKED ON- BUT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YEAH- YEAH I INTERNET ASSOCIATION AND SO THE OPPOSITION DFL FIVE TO BASICALLY TRY TO REFINE THE DEFINITION. OF WE HAVEN'T DECIDED ON ONE PARTICULAR DEFINITION AS YET BUT THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL ITERATIONS OF THAT THE VERY THE- DEFINITION BEING CIRCULATED RIGHT NOW ALSO- CERTAIN PARTIES ARE. Y'ALL THEM THEY LIKE ONE VERSION NOT MORE THAN THE OTHERS SO WE JUST NEED AND SORTED OUT ALL OUT- BUT IT DEALT PRIMARILY IT DEALS WITH THE- THE FIRST THREE ITEMS OF THE DEFINITION. AND SO. SECIFIC EIGHT REGARDING THE WAY. OF AROUND INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING COORDINATING DECEPTIVE AND ALSO THE- THE BEHAVIOR PIECE ALSO SO I THINK- SO YOU KNOW THERE IS NO DEFINITIVE- OF VERSION AS YET THAT SO AGREED. AGREED TO BY EVERYBODY AT THIS POINT I SEE AND- I YEAH I GUESS QUESTION FOR EITHER FOR YOU OR FOR THE FOR YOUR WITNESS ON. THIS FIRST- PRONG ASKED INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING OR INACCURATE SO THERE'S AN INTENT REQUIREMENT WHICH- WAS AN IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD IN OTHER AREAS WERE PLAYING WITH- MAKING A JUDGMENT ABOUT. FALSENESS LIKE DEFAMATION THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT. THIS INTENT REQUIREMENT IT'S IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD AGAINST A CHILLING EFFECT BUT I. WONDERING HOW THAT WORKS IN THIS CONTEXT I MEAN. BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TOHAVE A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM MAKING A DETERMINATION IN REAL TIME- ABOUT WHAT WAS KNOWN WHAT THE INTENT OF THE CONTENT SHARE WISE- AND THEN YOU KNOW- DOES THE SAME STANDARD HAVE TO BE MET FOR EACH PERSON WHO SHARES THE CONTENT AFTER THAT- OR WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY TAKE A PIECE OF ORIGINAL CONTENT THAT MAY BE WHAT IS. I SHARED WITH WITH ILL INTENT- BUT THE SCHERER DOES NOT HAVE THAT SAME INTENT AND THEY HAD SOME COMMENTARY THAN THEIR OWN ORIGINAL CONTENT. SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE THESE QUESTIONS- THESE ISSUES BEING RESOLVED. BUT THE LAW ESSENTIALLY- PASSED THE TECH COMPANY ORDER FORM TO DISCLOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HOW SUCH A POLICY. SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MANDATE THE CONTENT. OF THE POLICY ITSELF- OR DOES IT. NEED A DOES IT COMPELS SPEECH SHELF EXAMPLE IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE DEFINITION OF- LET'S SAY- OF THIS PATIENT. YES. IT DEFINITION THAT'S OUT OF ACCEPTED BY ALL PARTIES THAT BUT- I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN BUT YOU KNOW THE- THE INTENT HERE IS TO FIND. A TO FIND THE LOWEST- COMMON DENOMINATOR DOT WOULD BASICALLY FIT. ON THE DEFINITION OF THE DEFINITION OF MISINFORMATION ACROSS THE BOARD. ARE THERE ARE A LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED OR THERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OUT THERE. AND SOME OF THE PLATFORM STATE YOU HAVE POLICIES SOME DELL SO THAT YOUR INTENT IS TO BASICALLY CREATE ONE UNIFORM POLICY. I WOULD ALLOW ALL PLATFORMS TO COMPLY WITH. AND OF SO. SO TAXES EXACTLY WHAT WE WORKING ON THE DEFINITION OF. OKAY I MEAN I DON'T SEE LIKE HUGE PROBLEM I GUESS THE IDEA OF DISCLOSURE BUT IT IT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE THIS MIGHT BE THE FIRST STEP DOWN HE ROAD MAYBE. AT TRYING TO ADD MORE. CLOSELY MONITOR YEAH AND- AND YOU KNOW REQUIRE A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO MONITOR- THEIR CONTENT FOR. FOR FAKE NEWS- AND I SO I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT THE- SAFEGUARDS THAT WE'VE RECOGNIZED AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT- YOU CRIMINALIZING YOU KNOW FALSE STATEMENTS- FROM. UNDULY BURDENING SPEECH- IT. MIGHT NOT BE WORKABLE IN THE CONTEXT- THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. AND SO I JUST THINK THAT- THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE MINDFUL OF BEFORE WE GO TOO FAR DOWN THIS ROAD I DO GET IT. AND THE DEFINITION WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN FROM. OUT OF THE VERBIAGE THAT'S BEING USED BY OTHER- SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AS WELL SO THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH ALIGN WITH WHAT'S OUT THERE AS FAR AS THE DEFINITION ISN'T. DEFINITIONS CONCERT BUT I DON'T KNOW FOUGHT FOR SYSTEMS AS ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. SO JUST NINETY I COULD ASK SINCE ARE YOU STILL. THERE YES I. AT THAT YOU FOR THE UP. TO VOTE ON THIS I DO THINK IT'S REALLY. THAT THIS STATUTE IS NOT ATTEMPTING TO DO WHAT WILL GIVE A CALL. IT'S JUST A EXACT WHAT. A THE AFTER. WITH OF. FALSE INFORMATION THAT'S BEING DISSEMINATED BROUGHT SO THE ONLY THING THAT'S DAHLE WE IN THIS BILL IS TO REQUIRE THAT THE PLOT HAS TO INFORM ITS CUSTOMERS- IT WAS THEY'RE USING IT ALL WHETHER IT HAS A POLICY OR NOT I AND OF COURSE THE RIVER SENATE AND I CERTAINLY AGREE- THAT THE POTENTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT COULD COME UP WAY WAY DOWN THE ROAD COULD BE INVOLVED BECAUSE MOST FUNDAMENTALLY THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOESN'T RESTRICT. THE CONDUCT OF PRIVATE PARTIES ONLY DEALS WITH THE GOVERNMENT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S A CONCERN HERE IT'S IN A WAY BACK GENERATED BY THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T OF THE NORMAL REGULATORY PROCESS IS A PLACE BECAUSE PRIVATE COMPANIES THEN IF PRIVATE PUMP START ACTING ALMOST LIKE THE GUY AND THEY START CENSORING EACH AND REALLY EXPRESS WAY I THEN THAT RAY REALLY IMPORT POLICY. BUT BUT THIS BILL IS BACK ABOUT FOUR STEPS WE GET TO THE PROBLEM AREA BECAUSE ALWAYS REQUIRING IS THE NOT THE IT PLATFORM WOULD HAVE HAVE A POLICY THEY JUST HAVE TO INFORM. THOSE WHO. WITH EVERY STATE TO CARE ABOUT IT WHETHER THEY HAVE A POLICY HERE NOT. AND THE CON. AT LEAST NOW STONE UP TO THAT. THANK YOU CODE. OKAY THANK YOU DRESS. THANK YOU MR TRUMP THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK THAT IS MISTER KILEY SAID THIS IS THE FIRST STEP AND WE DO HAVE TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE STATISTICS THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE RELYING ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO GET THEIR NEWS AND OFTENTIMES THERE ON TROOPS THEIR FALSE STATEMENTS KNOWINGLY MADE FALSE STATEMENTS SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP AND I MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TO GALLAGHER. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SO NUMBER CHAO I KNOW YOU AND I BOTH. CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT. THE PROBLEM OF MISINFORMATION BUT WE APPROACH THIS IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS RIGHT SO. YOU KNOW FOR ME ONE OF MY BIG CONCERNS HAS BEEN THE ACTUAL CENSORSHIP THAT WE ALREADY SEEN. ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE WAY THAT I APPROACH THIS IS I THINK THAT ACTUALLY- MORE SPEECH. IS WHAT ENDS UP. EXPOSING THINGS FALSE AND THEORIES- AND SHOWING THAT THINGS ARE NOT ACCURATE MORE SPEECH HELPS. BRING THAT OUT- AND DISPEL THE MYTHS THAT ARE OUT THERE- RATHER THAN LAST SPEECH AND RATHER THAN AND SUPPRESSING SPEECH- AND I DO I WORRY THAT. NUMBER ONE I WORRY ABOUT THE TECH COMPANIES THEMSELVES THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THEMSELVES YOU KNOW I HAD LEGISLATION THAT WAS FOCUSED ON NOT ALLOWING THEM TO CENSOR SOMETHING. WE BASED ON THE POLITICAL NATURE OF THE SPEECH AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE THAT APPEARS TO BE THE CASE THAT IT WAS MORE ABOUT THE VIEWPOINT OF THE PERSON BRINGING THAT THEN WHETHER OR NOT AND- YOU KNOW IT WAS. ACCURATE OR OR OR CERTAINLY LIKE TO THE FORMS OF SPEECH THAT THE CONSTITUTION AS SET ARE LESS PROTECTED OBSCENITY. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. CALLS TO VIOLENCE AGAINST PEOPLE THINGS LIKE THAT IMMEDIATE ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST A PERSON'S IN GROUPS- BUT LARGELY I THINK WE NEED TO TRY AND KEEP A FREE MARKET OF SPEECH BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO SUPPRESS ENOUGH AND I'LL I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THEM. I THINK IT REALLY WE REALLY SEEN THAT IT WORKS WHEN IT COMES. TO MAJOR PUBLIC FIGURES FOR INSTANCE JUST YESTERDAY YOU KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH HAD TWEETED ABOUT JOE SCARBOROUGH. AND PERHAPS IN BEING INVOLVED WITH THE DEATH OF ONE OF HIS INSURANCE AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CALLED OUT BY ALMOST ALL THE NEWS AND- AND ALL DIFFERENT PEOPLE SAYING THAT AS A CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN FALSE. IT'S ALMOST IMMEDIATELY JUMPED ON AND THE MARKET OF FREE SPEECH. BASICALLY CALLED THAT OUT RIGHT AND I THINK WE CAN LOOK TO MANY DIFFERENT CASES WHERE THAT IS BEEN. THE CASE- WHERE WE WHERE WE SEEM TO HAVE SOME PROBLEM- IS REALLY AND EXAMPLE BOX THAT ARE OUT THERE- THIS WAS. MOST OF THE CALLED OUT THE MODEL REPORT FOR THE MOVE PART SAID THAT THESE RUSSIA BOUGHT. WHAT THEY WERE DOING IS THEY WERE ACTUALLY POSING AS FOR EXAMPLE A BLACK LIVES MATTER GROUP WHERE THEY WERE POSING AS A TEA PARTY. GROUP AND THEY WERE STILL KEEN REALLY THE FIRE. AND STOKING THE INDIVIDUAL- PASSIONS OF THESE GROUPS- USING FALSE NARRATIVES THAT WEREN'T EVEN ACTUALLY TRUE BUT THEY GOT THAT GROUP. TO BE ANIMATED IMMOBILIZED- THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE AREAS WHERE IT'S MORE SURREPTITIOUS WHERE. YOU WANT SPEECH TO BE ABLE TO CALL THOSE THINGS OUT AND I GUESS TO MY COLLEAGUES POINT ABOUT. LOOK MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT SOCIAL MEDIA AGAIN THEIR NEWS THERE BUT WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT. TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES. AND TO BE PUBLICLY INFORMED IT'S THE PER IS THE INDIVIDUAL AND- THAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT VIEW POINT YOU SHOULD BE YOU SHOULD BE EXPOSED YOU SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO MANY DIFFERENT. YOU SHOULD JUST LISTEN TO FOX NEWS OR YOU SHOULD JUST LISTEN TO CNN. RIGHT SAID TO ME THE ANSWER IS MORE SPEECH IT'S AS AND NOT FINDING WAYS ACTUALLY SUPPRESS BEACH AND MY CONCERN WITH YOUR BILLS YEAH THE FIRST LEVEL IT'S JUST ASKING THEM TO SAY DO WE HAVE A POLICY. BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE'S BILLS BY SENATOR PAN FOR EXIT FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE LOOKING TO HAVE A PLAN TO TELL YOU KNOW PLAN A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW SPEECH SHOULD BE HANDLED ON THESE PLATFORMS AND I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO MORE SUPPRESSION WERE ALREADY SEEN IT ON THE PLATFORMS THEMSELVES. WHERE THEY'RE CENSORING SPEECH. AND THE MORE THE GOVERNMENT GETS INVOLVED I GET REALLY CONCERNED. BECAUSE IN GOVERNMENT STARTS DETERMINING BASED ON THEIR PLAN- BASED ON SOME DEFINITION THAT WE MIGHT COME UP WITH. WHAT CONSTITUTES TRUE NEWS AND FAKE NEWS AND IT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLACE TO DO THAT IT REALLY IS NOT- AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN BEGIN THE USE THAT POWER TO SUPPRESS LEGITIMATE VIEWPOINTS ONCE A DAY DON'T AGREE WITH SUB SUB SUPPRESS CRITICISM EVEN GOVERNMENT AND I'M A PROFESSOR SIMS YOU KNOW YOU BROUGHT THAT UP THAT. DOWN THE ROAD THIS COULD BECOME MORE OF A PROBLEM. I BELIEVE THAT. THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE LIKE A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM WHICH THERE HAS BEEN CASE LAW SAYING LOOK IN LIMIT PUBLIC FORMS YOU HAVE TO ALLOW FOR FREE SPEECH AND THE EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE PRIVATE AREAS. THESE ARE PRIVATE COMPANIES BECAUSE THESE NOW HAVE BECOME A FORM I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS ON THE BERKELEY CAMPUS AS AN UNDERGRADUATE. THERE WAS NOT IT IN SPROUT PLAZA THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF YOU POINTS. BEING EXPRESSED OUT THERE AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S EVEN THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY THAT IS. THAT'S FALSE IS NOT EVEN TRUE RIGHT. AND YET. BECAUSE THAT WAS A PUBLIC FORUM WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY YOU KNOW THE BIRTH OF THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT. WE DIDN'T TRY TO SUPPRESS. PEOPLE SPEECH- WE USED OUR SPEECH TO SAY HEY HERE'S WHAT WE BELIEVE IN HERE'S WHAT WE THINK IS TRUE. AND I BELIEVE THAT FOR IS THE ULTIMATE DISINFECTANT IS THE ULTIMATE. TRUTH TELLER BECAUSE- TRUTH WILL OF TRUTH WILL EVENTUALLY RISE. TO THE TOP IT AMONG SAYS IT WILL IT WILL CALL OUT THINGS ARE FALSE AND SO THAT I MEAN ALL THAT TO SAY. I DID I DID I GET CONCERNED WERE MOVING TOO FAR INTO THE SPACE FOR ACTUALLY GONNA ALTERNATELY SUPPRESS LEGITIMATE VIEW POINTS WE'RE GOING TO WEAR THIS COULD BE THE FOCUS OF. SUPPRESSING SPEECH- I NECESSARILY I THINK WE'RE ALL WORRIED ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE. LOOK I MEAN PEOPLE LISTEN TO A VARIETY OF VIEWPOINTS AND PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO BE WRONG. PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO. YOU KNOW BELIEVE THE THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT'S KIND OF A FUNDAMENTAL CORNERSTONE OF THIS COUNTRY AND IF THE GOVERNMENT STARTS GETTING TOO FAR INTO THAT WILL WE'RE GOING TO TEACH PEOPLE WHAT THEY BELIEVE THEM NO MORE NOT. THE AMERICA THAT I KNOW. AT THE END OF THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THIS AND YOU'RE SOMEHOW. WRONG AND I'VE BUT I WORRY ABOUT GOING DOWN. A PAST LIKE THAT SO I MEAN. HAPPY TO HAVE YOU RESPOND TO THAT AND GIVE ME YOUR THOUGHTS BUT- THAT'S MY CONCERN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER GALLAGHER FOR COMMENTS- LET LET ME SAY THIS I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE SHOULD NOT SUPPRESS. A SPEECH WHATSOEVER BECAUSE WE THAT'S WHAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS ALL ABOUT THAT. AND THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE DOES NOT SUPPRESS SPEECH- AS MENTIONED BY PROFESSOR SAM AND- AND IT DOES NOT. EITHER ENCOURAGE OR DISCOURAGE SPEECH. IT DOES NOT- COMPELS SPEECH. ARE WE DID MENTION A WORD I THINK ON A KIND OF. PIGGY BACK ON THAT AND THAT IS SO I THINK. OFTENTIMES WE NEED TO KIND OF. A SEEK A BALANCE BETWEEN. OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT LET'S SEE WHAT THE USERS OUT THERE NEED. AT THIS DAY AND AGE I THINK PEOPLE UP THERE ARE HUNGRY FOR INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS PROVIDING. THE PROBLEM IS A LOT OF SENSE TIONS SIR RATED. NOW WHAT JUST ONE. THIS DOES IS ESSENTIALLY AS MENTIONED EARLIER ONLY TO WE- DOT PLOT FOR TO DISCLOSE WHETHER THEY- ARE THEY HAVE SUCH A POLICY. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MISINFORMATION. DOES NOT IS CONTENT NEUTRAL IT IS SAW TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. SO THAT'S WHY WE DON'T HAVE ANY FIRST DIMINISH IT NOW. AS TO YOUR FEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW GOING TO STEP TO STEP FORWARD I MEAN THAT'S IN THE FUTURE I MEAN. I DO NOT INTEND TO GO ANY FURTHER THAN THIS AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT. SO I THINK IT'S A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN LET'S SAY OF. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR SOCIETY AND WHAT THE USERS. NEED TO KNOW BECAUSE THESE USERS OF JUST LAY PEOPLE STATE THEY DON'T KNOW ANY DIDN'T THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF A LOT OF SOPHISTICATION WHEN IT COMES TO FAKE NEWS FOR EXAMPLE. SO HOW WOULD THEY DISCERN WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS NOT TRUE. SO THAT HAS TO BE DOLLARS WHICH- THE PLATFORMS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY HOW MUCH DID THEY DO. YOU KNOW IN THIS EQUATION. TO DATE FACT CHECK SHOULD THEY REMOVE THE CONTENT WELL SHOULD THEY JUST DO A DISCLOSURE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S A SIMPLE DISCLOSURE BILL. SO I DON'T KNOW PROFESSOR SINCE YOU YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT AS I THINK WE'RE- WE GET. THE AD THEY WERE GOOD AT THIS POINT I WAS MORE OF A STATEMENT BY MISTER GALLAGHER THAN. A QUESTION ULTIMATELY MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF. MR CHOW I PRECIADO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH. THE LANGUAGE. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL AGREEMENT THAT SOMETHING IS BAD AND WE WANT TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THIS INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE CHOOSE TO USE MATTERS BECAUSE WE'RE WRITING THE WALKING. SO THE U. YOU'VE- BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT YOU'RE NOT ATTEMPTING TO REQUIRE CERTAIN CONTENT OF THE POLICY YOU JUST WANT TO- REQUIRE THAT A DISCLOSURE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE POLICY EXISTS IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SO- IF THE POLICY WAS-WE THINK WE DON'T CURATE THIS PLATFORM USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK BUT IS THAT. IT AND YOU JUST CLOSE THAT THERE IS A POLICY IS THAT IMPLANTS OF WITH THIS BILL THAT'S OF ISIS WHAT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS LAW OKAY BUT SO WHAT IF YOUR CAR IF THAT'S CASE WHAT THE OUR PURPOSE FOR THE U. OUT THERE TO THIS. WHICH OF THESE PLATFORMS I DO HAVE A POLICY WE FATE NEW OR VISIT SO DATE COULD BE THE ARE THE YOU KNOW THE COULD PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH HAVE A FIVE THE RIGHT TO GET ON LOOK AT THE PHARMACY I JUST JUST IS JUST NO BECAUSE IT'S PLATFORM A SPECIFICALLY. THE WE DON'T THINK APOLLO TO SIR THAT'S UP TO THE PLATFORM ITSELF. THE BUTTON. IS SO I MEAN IT IS A USER OF THE- I SEE THAT HAVE THE POWER. TO THE- SPREAD OF IN A- AND BUT THE POLICIES ACTUALLY SAYING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A- SO OFTEN ABOUT IS THAT HOW HOW GAME TO A USER OF THE- WELL IT. IF THEY DON'T HAVE A- TO YOU KNOW. THAT THE- LETTER DOUBLE BEWARE I GUESS THE CUSTOMER. THAT I MEAN IF THE USER. STILL WANTS TO USE OUR PLATFORM THAT'S UP ON KNOW THAT THEIR OWN FOR OUR- WE NOT SEE. THIS PART ON THE NUMBER POLICY. USE THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING I WHATSOEVER. SO THIS IS TO HELP THE- TO BASIC GIVE US A GUIDANCE AS TO WHICH- DOES. HAVE A POP. FOR JUST ISSUE WHICH- PROVIDES. BUT WE DO WILL GIVE THEM NO GUIDE SOMETIMES I DON'T TO GET A- CALL IF WE HEAR. SEC BUT I MEAN IF YOU SEE MY- RIGHT. WELL IF THE POLICY. AMOUNT THIS WE DON'T THINK NEED A POLL. IN WE'RE SAYING THE THAT'S UP. AND THEN I'M JUST AND PEOPLE YES WE HAVE A POT. HOW IS THAT GIVING ME ANY USEFUL INFORMATION A USER PLATFORM. THAT WOULD PROBABLY WHAT JUST HAPPENED. DOWN GIVE TO YOU. NO MORE SURE AND SAYS TO THE COME. YOU DOING. BUSINESS OKAY I DON'T SEE THAT IT DOES. MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S- I DO THINK THAT THE- YOU KNOW IN THIS WHOLE DEBATE. THERE THERE MERIT. TO BE INACCURATE. YOU KNOW IF I PUT A STATE WITH ITS- I CAN SAY MAN IS GOOD. ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE IS THAT AN ACCURATE WELL SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS. IT ALL IT'S ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULT THING. TO PROVE DEFINITIVELY THAT'S ACCURATE OR INACCURATE. I MEAN WHAT ONCE YOU GET ONCE YOU START TO SLICE DOWN ON IT JUST ENDS UP BEING. THE THIS HUGE PROBLEM. AND WE END UP HAVING TO COME BACK DOWN THE SIDE OF FREE SPEECH AND SAYING OKAY LOOK. WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN PEOPLE POST SOMETHING. IT IS THEIR OPINION. AND YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO RELY ON IT IS FACT IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GO FACT CHECK AND THAT THEN THAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW. WITH WITH I'M HERE FOR VERY GOOD REASON. SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS WITH THE BILL I JUST. I DON'T SEE THAT. THAT THIS IS MAKING MEANINGFUL STEPS IN THE DIRECTION IS GOING TO SOLVE THE ACTUAL PRODUCT. HI WHAT YOU'RE COMING FROM BUT I DO DISAGREE. BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE- IN A MINUTE. FOREST HELP AS WELL. OFFERS HOW DO YOU INTERPRET CASE LAW AND- SO FORTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR MORE I AM THREE HOUR. SO I WAS JUST READING AND I KNOW YOU'RE CHANGE THE DEFINITION BUT YOU KNOW AS AS THINGS ARE NOW. WE'RE ASKING THEM TO WHAT IS OUR POLICY TO ADDRESS THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION INCLUDING INACCURATE CONTENT REPORTED AS FACT. DECEPTICON UNAIDED AND DECEPTIVE PROMOTION OR SUPPRESSION OF INFORMATION. AND PRACTICES INTENDED TO MANIPULATE OR DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR OF USERS. ON SOCIAL MEDIA PRO WHAT DO WE GET DO WITH CAMPAIGNS. THIS GOT YOUR MASK IN ORDER TO MAKE IT AND SORRY NEEDLE THERE. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND POLITICAL SPEECH RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY AND THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE- THAT MAKE A LOT OF DEPEND ON WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON HE WOULD SAY. HEY THOSE ARE- NOT QUITE ACCURATE THERE YOU BEING USED TO MANIPULATE THEIR BEING USED TO PROMOTE. ARE BEING USED TO SUPPRESS SOMETHING ELSE. HOW CERTAINLY POLITICAL SPEECH IS PROTECTED SPEECH RIGHT HOW WE GONNA DO WITH THAT OR HOW DO YOU PROPOSE THE SOCIAL MEDIA. PLATFORM TO DEAL WITH THAT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A SHORT ANSWER AND THEN I WANTED TO FOR TO- PROFESSOR THE SHORT ANSWER IS OUT THAT PART OF THE DEFINITION IS STILL BE PARKED ON. SO WITH THAT- CAN I REFER TO AS- PROFESSOR SAM JUST FOR QUICK YES PROFESSOR SIMPLY VERY OF SOMETHING TO ADD TO THAT BRIEFLY HAVE ANYTHING SURE I WOULD JUST OKAY IN TERMS OF THE FIRST MANY CATEGORIES. THE MOST TROUBLING OR IS OUR CONTENT BASED REGULATION AND OF COURSE WE KNOW EVEN THERE ARE SOME CONTENT PASTE REGULATIONS OKAY IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH LIFE ALERT YOU'RE DEALING WITH OBSCENITY. CHILD **** THIS BILL IS WAY BACK FROM THAT BOUNDARY BECAUSE IT'S NOT DEALING WITH THE CONTENT AT ALL IT'S REQUIRING. PROVIDER OF A CERTAIN SERVICE TO MAKE CERTAIN DISCLOSURE THOSE USING THE PLATFORM. AND IT'S I BELIEVE WELL DESIGNED TO LET PEOPLE FIGURE OUT. TO SOME DEGREE HOW MUCH RELIANCE TAKING PLACE AND WHAT THEY SEE YOU KNOW IF THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S NO POLICY WE DON'T CENSOR THIS MATURE WE DON'T LOOK AT IT AT ALL ANYTHING GO WELL THEN. MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE CAUTIOUS IN. LOOKING AT THE JOB THEY'RE DECIDING WHETHER IT'S CREDIT. RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER JOHN HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BECAUSE OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY SAYS NOT WHAT. FEARFUL IT IT MIGHT SAY DOWN THE LINE AND I AGREE IT'S JUST A NOTICE BILL. AND WHETHER A PLATFORM HAS A POLICY EXPLICITLY OF NOT TOUCHING ANY OF THIS WAR HAS A MORE NUANCED POLICY THAT IS INFORMATION TO THE END USER BECAUSE IT END USER ESPECIALLY THINK OF IT IN THE CONTEXT OF. THE PARENTS HELPING A CHILD DECIDE. HOW TO FILTER. WHAT IS COMING OFF OF A OF A WEBSITE WELL WORLD OF A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM THE INFORMATION THAT THERE IS. NO CONCERN FOR FILTERING AT ALL ON THAT. TOP PLATFORM OR THAT THERE IS SOME I THINK IS VERY USEFUL. THE BECAUSE- THE INFORMATION COMING OUT OF THIS BROAD THING THAT WE CALL THE INTERNET IS SO PROLIFIC IT IS SO RIGHT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES I THINK WE HAVE AS A SOCIETY IS FILTERING INFORMATION WE HAVE. AND I ACTUALLY WISH THAT. THE INDUSTRY WOULD COME UP WITH. DISCLOSURE THE BULLS THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR A USER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RISK MAY OR MAY NOT BE WITH RESPECT TO THAT SITE AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK YOU WERE ATTEMPTING TO DO AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WORKING OUT BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS OR REALLY GOING TO MATTER IN HERE AND I THINK IF THIS WAS GOING TO IN FACT REGULATORS STEP INTO REGULATIONS BECAUSE I AGREE THAT THAT IS A KIND OF A DANGEROUS PLACE TO GO BUT I THINK IT'S VERY USEFUL FOR A USER OF. ANY PLATFORM. TO HAVE A COMMUNICATION FROM WHOEVER'S RUNNING THAT PLATFORM TO SAY OUR POLICY IS NO POLICY WHICH IS A POLICY OR OUR POLICY IS THESE GUIDELINES WHICH IS A MORE. ENUMERATED POLICY THAT'S INFORMATION THAT THAT A USER CAN BE USED TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO INTERACT OR HOPEFULLY. TO FILTER THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE GETTING SO THAT BECAUSE THE USER DOES NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT INFORMATION. THE MORE THEY UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE VERACITY FOR THE CONTROLS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THERE ARE NOT THAT I'M SUGGESTING WE PUT CONTROLS ON THERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT BECOMES TROUBLING. BUT AT LEAST A STATEMENT. THAT IS COMMON ACROSS PLATFORMS SO THAT TE USER HAS AN ABILITY TO SAY. OKAY I'M GONNA BE GETTING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONTROLS OVER FALSE INFORMATION OR THERE'S AT LEAST AN ATTEMPT. TO CONTROL FALSE INFORMATION THIS IS WHAT IT IS. THEN THE USER COULD DECIDE I AGREE WITH THAT OR AYE THOSE CONTROLS OR I DISAGREE WITH THOSE CONTROLS AND MAKE A DECISION AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS APPROPRIATE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT IS JUST A NOTIFICATION WE'RE ASKING. THE PLATFORMS TO SAY WHAT IT IS YOU DO SO THAT THE END USER HAS BETTER INFORMATION. TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO RELY ON THAT INFORMATION OR WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. WITH THAT THAT SITE WERE THAT PLATFORM. SO I THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE AT THIS POINT THIS WOULD BE USEFUL INFORMATION. AND THERE ARE OTHER AREAS I THINK THAT THE INDUSTRY COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF INFORMING CONSUMERS ABOUT WHAT THEY DO WITH INFORMATION THAT WOULD LEAD TO CONSUMERS MAKING BETTER DECISIONS THAT MAYBE AYBE NOT. BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD IT WOULD BE USEFUL IN THAT CONTEXT SO I THAT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOURE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE THOSE DEFINITIONS ULTIMATELY ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. IN HOW A USER DECIDES. HOW TO FILTER WHAT THEY'RE GETTING BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT THIS IS GOING TO ASK. FOLKS TO PUT FORWARD AND WE ARE SO FAR I THINK WE'RE SO FAR AWAY FROM. ANY CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION. THAT THIS IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE FOR. OUR COMMITTEE. SO WITH THAT THE STRAP. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR WE'RE I'VE OFTEN THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO SECOND. THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NOT VOTING. CHAU HI SO I TO AND SALAS HOLDEN KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE NO REYES AS I. THAT HAS FOUR VOTES OKAY I WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL THEN WITH FOUR VOTES THANK YOU MISTER THOMAS REYES WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB. TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE OPERATOR YOU CAN OPEN THE LINES FOR AB. TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE. THE LINES ARE OPEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS% ARE TODAY PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE WHICH WILL EXTEND THAT TO LEGAL GUARDIANS THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILD IF THE CHILD PASSES AWAY TO THE WRONG DUE TO THE WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF ANOTHER STAND AT THE ASSUMING THE CHILD HAS NO LIVING PARENTS. CURRENT LAW SPECIFIES THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BRING A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR THE DEATH OF A PERSON. COST BY THE WRONGFUL ACT OR NEGLECT OF ANOTHER. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE LIMITED TO THE DECEDENT'S SPOUSE. CHILDREN AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THOSE WHO WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE PROPERTY OF DECEDENT INCLUDING THE PARENTS. SPECIFICALLY A MINOR PASSES AWAY DUE TO THE WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF OTHERS AND THE MINERS ON MARRIED AND DOES NOT HAVE CHILDREN. THAN THOSE WHO CAN BRING FORTH THE CASE OR THE MINERS BIOLOGICAL OR ADOPTIVE PARENTS. BUT NOT EVERY CHILD IS RAISED BY THEIR PARENTS. IF THE MINERS REYES BY LEGAL GUARDIANS WHO HAVE NOT OFFICIALLY ADOPTD THE MINOR THESE LEGAL GUARDIANS DO NOT HAVE LEGAL STANDING TO BRING A CLAIM IN THE EVENT OF A WRONGFUL DEATH. EVEN THOUGH BOTH OF THE CHILD'S BIOLOGICAL OR ADOPTIVE PARENTS ARE DECEASED. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE CORRECT THIS OVERSIGHT IN LAW BY ALLOWING LEGAL GUARDIANS TO BRING FORTH A WRONGFUL DEATH CASE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS WHICH A PARENT CAN BRING. UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS- WHICH APPEARED CAN BRING FORTH THE CASE FOR THEIR CHILD. BUT ONLY WHEN THE DECEASED DECEASED CHILD'S PARENTS HAVE ALSO PASSED AWAY. CONTRARY TO THE OPPOSITION'S CLAIM BECAUSE LEGAL GUARDIANS WOULD BE ACTING AS A CHILD'S PARENT AND BRINGING FORTH THE CASE INSTEAD OF THE TILES DECEASED BIOLOGICAL OR ADOPTIVE PARENT. THIS BILL DOES NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO MAY BRING A CASE. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE ALLOWS A LEGAL GUARDIAN TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR CHILD WAS PASSED AWAY DUE TO THE WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF ANOTHER WHEN THE CHILD'S PARENTS CANNOT DO SO BECAUSE THEY ARE DECEASED. TO QUOTE THE ANALYSIS PREPARED BY THIS COMMITTEE. ALLOWING THE LEGAL GUARDIAN TO BRING ACTION IN THE SAME MANNER AS ANY OTHER PARENT WILL UPDATE THE WRONGFUL DEATH STATUTE. TO BETTER REFLECT THE CURRENT REALITIES OF LIFE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY RESPECTFULLY WILL BE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. NOT TO TESTIFY TESTIFIED VIA TELEPHONE TODAY. WE HAVE NEIL GALLO OCT TURNING IT PRIVATE ATTORNEY WITH TAYLOR IN RING. AND CAP THE SAKE MORE ON WHO IS A FAMILY LAW DIRECTOR FOR THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR LESBIAN RIGHTS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW TO THE MEMBERS THAT. THIS IS NOT A SPONSORED BILL THIS WAS BROUGHT ABOUT AS A RESULT OF THE CHILD DIEGO WHO DIED WITH NO PARENTS LIVING AND TO THE LEGAL GUARDIANS WERE PRECLUDED FROM FILING A CLAIM. AND MISTER GALLO UP WILL YOU MORE ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU WHERE DO YOU. START SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU THEY DO HAVE TWO LISTED FOLKS FOR SUPPORT NEW YORK A LOT AND KATHY SYCAMORE ARE. YOU ON THE LINE PLEASE. NEIL KILOWATT CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME YES WE CAN HERE GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU ABOUT THIS BILL BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION MY NAME IS NEIL CAL A LOT AND I AM A MEMBER OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO FOUR. FOUR FIVE. I AM AN ATTORNEY AT TAYLOR AND RING IN MANHATTAN BEACH. WHERE I CONCENTRATE MY PRACTICE IN THE AREAS OF SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY WRONGFUL DEATH AND SEXUAL ABUSE. ABOVE ALL AB TWO FOUR FOUR FIVE IS ABOUT FAIRNESS THIS BILL AIMS TO CORRECT INEQUITIES IN THE LAW UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A MINOR DIES DUE TO THE WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF OTHERS. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE RIGHTFUL HEIRS IN A WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION ASSUMING THE MINOR WAS UNMARRIED AND DID NOT HAVE CHILDREN ARE THE MINERS PARENTS. HOWEVER IF THE MINERS PARENTS PREDECEASED HIM OR HER THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR THE MINERS LEGAL GUARDIANS TO WRITE POLICE STEP INTO THE SHOES OF THE MINERS PARENTS. AND PURSUE WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS ON HIS BEHALF. AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS. THE LAW SAYS LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP IS NOT ENOUGH. THE LAW REQUIRES THE MINERS LEGAL GUARDIANS TO HAVE FORMALLY ADOPTED THE MINOR IN ORDER TO BRING A LAWSUIT ON THE MINOR'S BEHALF. THIS IS A COLORIST AND ANTIQUATED REQUIREMENT THAT SHOULD BE ELIMINATED AS THE LAW SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE CHANGING NATURE FAMILY. THIS BILL WOULD STILL REQUIRE THESE LEGAL GUARDIANS TO BE FORMALLY APPOINTED AT SUCH BY THE COURT PRIOR TO THE MINORS DEBT. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE A JUDICIAL OFFICER TO EVALUATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDERLYING THE APPOINTMENT AND CONCLUDE THAT THE PARTIES BRINGING THE APPLICATION SHOULD IN FACT BE APPOINTED THE MINERS LEGAL GUARDIANS. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT EXPAND THE UNIVERSE OF PLAINTIFFS THAT MAY PURSUE A WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION ON BEHALF OF A MINOR. RATHER IT MERELY ALLOWS LEGAL GUARDIANS TO STEP INTO THE SHOES OF THE MINERS PARENTS WANT BOTH PARENTS HAVE PASSED AWAY. IN SOME AB TWO FOUR FOUR FIVE NARROWLY A MEN'S EXISTING LAW TO ALLOW FOR THE RIGHTFUL PROSECUTION OF WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION. STEPPING INTO THE SHOES OF A PARENT IS NO EASY TASK WHEN INDIVIDUALS TAKE ON THIS NOBLE VENTURE THEY SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE SAME RIGHTS AFFORDED TO THE MINORS PARENTS. THAT JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT THE DIEGO CASE THAT MISS RATES MENTION THIS CASE INVOLVES A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS WHO WAS BULLIED PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED AND KILLED AT SCHOOL. IN THE MARINO VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. DIEGO'S PARENTS BOTH PREDECEASED IN HIS MOTHER PASSED AWAY WHEN HE WAS ONE YEAR OLD. AT ITS FATHER PASSED AWAY IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. DIEGO WAS RAISED BY HIS AUNT AND UNCLE HIS MATERNAL AUNT AND UNCLES IN PEOPLE'S ONE YOUR SOUL. HE LIVES IN THE HOUSE WITH THEM THEY TOOK CARE OF THEM AND THEY FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED HIM AND SO IT SEEMS ONLY FAIR THAT GIVEN THAT THEY WERE APPOINTED LEGAL GUARDIANS FOR DIEGO THAT THEY ALSO BE AFFORDED HE SAME RIGHTS THAT DIEGO'S PARENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFORDED. AN EAGLES PARENTS BOTH PREDECEASED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CAMARA. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KATHY SAKE MORA AND I'M TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR LESBIAN RIGHTS. NATIONAL CENTER FOR LESBIAN RIGHTS TO THE NASH IN A LEGAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO ADVANCING THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS. OF LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES. AS A PART OF OUR MISSION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE RIGHT TO ALL FAMILIES REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY ARE FORMED AND WHETHER THERE ARE BIOLOGICAL OR ADOPTIVE FOR LEGAL TIES. WE BELIEVE THE LEGAL GUARDIAN SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION BEEN ALLOWED TO PURSUE- THESE ACTIONS IN THE CASE OF A WRONGFUL DEATH OF THEIR CHILD BECAUSE IN EVERY WAY THE ACTIVE PARENTS FOR THE CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THEIR CARE. ADDITIONALLY WHEN CHILDREN WITH LEGAL GUARDIANS DO NOT HAVE LEGAL PARENTS. IN THE PICTURE AT ALL ALL THOSE GUARDIAN SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO PROTECTING THE START THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD IF THE CHILD. IS WRONGFULLY KILLED. LEGAL GUARDIAN ARTIST IS AFFECTED BY THE TRAGIC DEATH OF THE CHILD. AND THE PARENT WOULD BE. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ORDER AYE VOTE. ON AB TWENTY FOUR FOUR FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE. HERE THE HEARING ROOM WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE. SEEING NONE OPERATOR OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO LIKE SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE. THANK YOU IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT PRESSED ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AT NINE TWENTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. JANUARY TERRACE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY OTHER THAN SUPPORT LEAVE AT ONE THEN ZERO AT THE TIME. THERE ARE NO OTHERS AT THE PORT. THANK YOU I HAVE NO OPPOSITION LISTED IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOMWOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE. THERE IS ANYONE IN OPPOSITION THE PERFECT ONE THEN ZERO AT THE TIME. THERE'S NO ONE IN OPPOSITION I THANK YOU BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS TO GALLAGHER. YEAH JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. UNDER UNDER YOUR BILL AS PROPOSED WITH THE LEGAL GUARDIAN STILL HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE DEPENDENT ON THE DECEIT NO OKAY SO HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK. THEY ARE JUST THE LEGAL GUARDIAN JUST AS THE PARENT WOULD NOT HAVE TO PROVE THAT IS A DIFFERENT SECTION OKAY- THAT WAS- STATED JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S THE ONLY OTHER WAY THAT THE PARENT WOULD BE ABLE TO. TO FILE A CLAIM BUT HERE SIMPLY BEING A PARENT ALLOWS IN THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RIGHT TO FILE THE CLAIM OKAY IS THERE ANY RESTRICTION ON DO ALL THE OTHER. HEIRS AND- SORRY THE- DOES THE DECEDENT STILL HAVE TO. NOT HAVE ANY OTHER SURVIVING PARENTS OR OTHER HEIRS. THE DECEDENT THE DECEDENT'S LEGAL GUARDIAN WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE PARENTS OR WHATEVER RIGHT THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE IN BRINGING FORTH THE LAWSUIT THAT LEGAL GUARDIAN WOULD STEP IN THEIR SHOES. OKAY. ARE THERE SOME AND MAYBE SOME OF ONE OF THE WITNESSES COULD. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY A LEGAL GUARDIAN MIGHT NOT PROCEED WITH ADOPTION I'M THINKING IN MOST OF THESE CASES IS USUALLY A CHILD INVOLVED. WHAT ARE SOME REASONS LEGAL GUARDIAN MIGHT NOT MOVE TOWARDS ADOPTION BECAUSE UNDER THE CURRENT LAW DOESN'T A DOCTOR IF. YOU CAN BRING ROB WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM RIGHT. I'M SURE THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF REASON IT MAY JUST BE TIMING- IF- NEIL GULLIBLE OUGHT TO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A RESPONSE IF YOU KNOW. EIGHT AND MISTER GALLAGHER LET ME ALSO RESPOND TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION JUST BRIEFLY SO THE LEGAL GUARDIAN STEP INTO THE SHOES OF THE PARENTS THAT HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO SAY WHAT. IF THE MINER WHO PASSED AWAY HAD A SURVIVING SPOUSE OR A CHILD. THEN UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE LAW SAYS THE PARENTS COULD ONLY BRING A CLAIM IF THEY WERE FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT TO SOME EXTENT. ON THE MIND. SO UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES A LEGAL GUARDIAN WOULD HAVE TO PROVE FINANCIAL DEPENDENCY BUT ABSENT A SPOUSE. OR CHILD OF THE DECEASED MINOR THEN THE LEGAL GUARDIANS WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM JUST AS THE PARENTS WOULD WITHOUT HAVING TO PROVE FINANCIAL DEPEND SO IN OTHER WORDS. THE LOFTY AND DOES IT IS THE LEGAL GUARDIANS JUST STEP INTO THE SHOES OF THE PAIR. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT ADOPTION I CAN SAY THAT THERE'S AT LEAST TWO THINGS THAT COME TO MIND ONE IS THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE LENGTHY AND IT CAN ALSO BE EXPENSIVE- THERE'S A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO. HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT POP PROCESS HIGHER FAMILY LAW ATTORNEYS- AND GO THROUGH A LINK TO YOUR PROCESS TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. AND IT'S MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE AND MUCH LESS ONEROUS FOR THEM TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BECOMING A LEGAL GUARDIAN- WHICH IS SHORTER LESS EXPENSIVE AND SO THAT IS A LOT OF THE REASON WHY THEY TEND TO BECOME PART INCIDENT AND- HOLD OFF ON. FORMALLY ADOPTED THE CHILD. ALL I HAD OKAY THE QUESTIONS COMMON. SEEING NONE WAS REYES WHO MAKE CLOTHES. FOR DIEGO AND FOR THE PARENTS WHO RAISED HIM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTIONAND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS DO PASS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER.

OPERATOR IF YOU COULD OPEN THE LINES FOR AB THIRTY TWENTY. THEY GIVE A LINE FOR OPEN. THANK YOU THIS GLORIA. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THAT COMMITTEE WITH ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWENTY TODAY MEMBERS UNDER EXISTING LAW ONLY PUBLIC PROSECUTORS MAY FILE LAWSUITS CHARGING UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES THESE ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR CITY ATTORNEY IN A CITY WITH A POPULATION GREATER THAN SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR DISTRICT ATTORNEY BRINGS FOR AN ACTION UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION ACT- DOT OFFICE RECEIVES ALL OF THE CIVIL PENALTIES AWARDED BY THE COURT HOWEVER WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY BRING SUCH AN ACTION THE CIVIL PENALTIES MUST BE SPLIT EVENLY WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THAT COUNTY. THIS DISCREPANCY HAS LEFT THOSE SAID ELIGIBLE CITY ATTORNEY'S WITH A DIFFICULT CHOICE OF BALANCING THE PURSUIT OF LEGAL RECOURSE AGAINST UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS WITH THE REALITY OF FIVE PUBLIC RESOURCES AB THIRTY TWENTY REQUIRES- PENALTIES BECAUSE WHAT COLLECTED BY THE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY FROM AN ACTION UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION ACT TO BE PAID TO THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ENTIRELY. BY ANSWERING AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF PENALTIES UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION ACT THIS BILL WILL EMPOWER THE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY TO PROSECUTE AGAINST UNFAIR BUSINESSES IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMERS AND OF OUR ENVIRONMENT THIS CHERRY WITH ME THIS MORNING BY PHONE IS SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY MARK ELLIOTT AND ALSO BY PHONE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE IS MARKET ACCOUNT OF THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY MARK MARK IT. UP RESPECT THE. YOU THAT YOU MISTER FOR THE WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA HAVE THE TWO MARK ANGKOR AND MAHER EL LISTA AS- TO. BY PHONE ARE YOU ON THE PLEASE. YEAH COULD THAT THE BAND ERA CREATE MARK ALLIA. AND I COMING THROUGH OKAY YES WE CAN YOU GOOD MORNING. PERFECT ALRIGHT THANK YOU FROM THE MEMBER GLORIA. I AM STANDING AT THE ATTORNEY MARA ALLIOT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT BELL. AND HE JUST HEARD UNDER STATE LAW. ERNIE PAPER BUT CITY OF MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HAVE AUTHORITY TO BRING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS BASED ON UNFAIR COMPETITION LAWS. ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN SHOOTING WHICH CASES TO PURSUE I LOOK FOR EGREGIOUS CASES WHERE OUR ENVIRONMENT AND BEING HARMED CONSUMERS ARE BEING DEFRAUDED BY BUSINESS. WORKERS ARE BEING SHORT CHANGED BY AN UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYER OR THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OUR PEOPLE IS JEOPARDIZED. WE TYPICALLY GIVE THE BUSINESS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLY AND THEN BRING LITIGATION WHEN OUR EFFORTS TO EDUCATE AND GAIN COMPLIANCE TRAIL. WE'VE BROUGHT CASES THAT ALLOW US TO ENSURE HARD WORKING SAN DIEGANS THEIR PAYS WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WORK THEY PERFORMED CONSUMERS ARE NOT CHARGED HIDDEN FEES OR OTHERWISE EXPLOITED. POLLUTANTS ARE REMOVED FROM OUR WATER WAYS AND THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS CAN ACCESS THE THIRD THAT THEY NEED TO RECOVER FROM THEIR ADDICTION. EIGHT AND SURE. AND ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE OF SAN DIEGO. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO NOT SHARE THE CIVIL PENALTIES IT RECOVERED FROM THESE CASES WITH THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. EVEN IF THE COUNTY DOES NOT STAND SINGLE SECOND THE FIFTEENTH WITH THE CASE. IF HOWEVER THE COUNTY BRINGS THE CASE UNDER THE LONG AND RECOVERY PENALTIES THE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE THE COUNTY TO SHARE THE PROCEEDS IT RECOVERS WITH THE CITY. THE DISTRIBUTION IS NOT FAIR AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WE'RE COVERING THE PENALTIES FOR THE WORK WE DO IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE INVEST THE PENALTIES LEAVE THE COVER INTO DOING MORE WORK THAT PROTECTS CONSUMERS WORKERS AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. IF UNFORTUNATE WHEN WE MUST REJECT THE CASE BECAUSE THE COCKPIT PURSUING IT IS OUTWEIGHED BY THE PANEL PEOPLE WHATEVER. UNDER EIGHTY THIRTY TWENTY THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WOULD KEEP ALL THE PENALTY THEY WERE COVERED WHEN THE RECOVERY IS DUE SOLELY TO ITS OWN EFFORT. THIS ENABLES US TO CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK THAT WE DO ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB THIRTY TWENTY. ALSO ON THE LINE IS CHIEF DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY MARK AND CORN HE OVERSEES ARE A PERMANENT CIVIL ENFORCEMENT UNIT WHICH IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR. PROSECUTING SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED CASES MARKET ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. MR ACCORDING TESTIMONY THAT YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE FOR YOU JUST AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. NO MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TWENTY. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TWENTY. IF YOU'RE A REPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THE TIME. AGAIN THE PROMPTER ONE AND THEN ZERO IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT. THERE'S NO ONE IN SUPPORT AT THE TIME. THANK YOU IS THERE I HAVE NO OPPOSITION LISTED IS THERE ANYONE IN THE- ROOM WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTY TWENTY. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANYBODY ON THE PHONE WHO WOULDLIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THIRTY TWENTY. IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE IF THEY'RE ALL AT THIS TIME. BUT NO ONE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS THIS GALLAGHER. YEAH SO. I THINK THE LARGEST CONCERN IS THAT THIS MAY BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL- AS A VIOLATE ARTICLE FOUR SECTION SIXTEEN. WHICH REQUIRES THAT A LOCAL OR SPECIAL STATUTE IS pCAN BE MADE APPLICABLE- SO THE QUESTION BECOMES- AND THE REASON THAT'S IN THERE IS WHY NOT DO IT GENERAL STATUTE THAT SAYS ALL CITIES- COULD IN FACT COLLECT. ALL THE PENALTIES- AND NOT SHARE THEM WITH THE COUNTIES WHY WE DO THIS ONLY FOR ONE. JURISDICTION SO I THINK THERE IS A- YOU'RE VERY FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE THERE THAT WE WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT. BUT MAYBE I JUST GOT I MEAN AND I'M HEARING I HEARD SOME OF THE TESTIMONY OTHER THINGS BEING HIGHLIGHTED AS- THINGS THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY WOULD WANT TO GO AFTER PROBABLY THINGS THAT EVERY CITY AND CALIFORNIA PROBABLY DEALS WITH IN SOME ASPECT AND YET THEY ALSO HAVE THE SAME PROVISION THAT THEY HAVE TO SHARE- WITH THE COUNTIES. SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO SEE LIKE WHAT IS. WHAT IS MAYBE SO FUNDAMENTALLY GOING ON IN SAN DIEGO THAT ISN'T PRESENT. IN OTHER AREAS. AND THEN I'LL GO TO THIS LIKE IS NOW THE BEST TIME TO BE REALLY GOING AFTER A LOT OF BUSINESSES- WHEN PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING CERTAINLY THERE ARE. LEGITIMATE VIOLATIONS. BUT YOU KNOW. THE OPPOSITE COULD BE TRUE AS WELL THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING AFTER BUSINESSES AT A TIME WHEN- A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING JUST TO SURVIVE- ESPECIALLY IN THE YOU KNOW IN OUR LARGE CITIES. HAPPY TRYING FIELD- THINK THERE'S A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN THERE WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST MATTER THERE IS A DECLARATION OF SPECIAL STATUTE IN SECTION TWO OF THE BILL HAS PROPOSED TO YOUR OBSERVATION THAT THIS IS LIMITED TO THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO- THE- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OR SYNOPSIS POINTS OUT THE LAST YEAR IN A VERY SIMILAR BILL WITH A BROADER- HEATING EIGHTY COMPASS MORE COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER THAT BILL WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR DO SOME- YOU KNOW THIS IS BASICALLY A FIVE TO THREE CITIES- CITIES OF SAN DIEGO SAN JOSE AND LOS ANGELES- BECAUSE THAT BROADER BILL- WAS NOT SIGNED INTO LAW WE'RE BACK HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY CITY A GO WITH THIS IS NOT CONTROVERSIAL THERE'S NOT A FIGHT BETWEEN THE COUNTY IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY ASKING FOR THE- YOUR LAST POINT YEAH. IRAQI THERE DIDN'T TIMES FOR BUSINESSES BUT THIS TOGETHER I'M SURE- YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MANY BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING. BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY BUSINESSES THAT ARE ENGAGING IN ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR EXPORTING THE PANDEMIC. AND WENT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN AUTHORIZE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO TO GO AFTER THAT. THANK YOU RECOGNIZE HOW YOUR COUNTY YOUR DA'S OVERWHELMED BY WORK HI THIS WOULD ALLOW. THE CITY ATTORNEY TO ALSO GO AFTER THIS THING WITHOUT HAVING TO- CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD BE NEXT. X. BUT- EXPENDING. A FINITE PUBLIC RESOURCES- WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PROPERLY- REIMBURSE THOSE EFFORTS INSTEAD HAVE A SHARE THAT- THOSE PROCEEDS BUT WITH THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO WHO. AS OUR CITY ATTORNEY MENTION MADE DONE NOTHING- WITH REGARD TO LEGAL PROCEEDING BUT IT'S STILL ENTITLED TO HALF. OF THE WAR. MORE JUST. A QUICK RESPONSE YOU KNOW. YES LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATION WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR I'M CONCERNED THIS ONE'S GONNA GET VETOED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT- BECAUSE IT IS A SPECIAL STATUTE WHERE YOU COULD DO A GENERAL. A STATUTE OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY. AND THEN LOOK I'D THERE'S NOTHING THAT PRECLUDES RIGHT NOW CITY OFFICES IN CITY ATTORNEYS FROM GOING AFTER ABOUT ACTORS AND THEY CAN AND SHOULD DO THAT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS GOING TO GREATER INCENTIVIZE BECAUSE NOW IT'S A REVENUE SOURCE IS EVEN MORE OF A GRADE A REVENUE SOURCE AND I'VE SEEN INSTANCES. WHERE WHEN THAT'S THE CASE- I WOULD ARGUE FRIVOLOUS SUITS GET BROUGHT AGAINST SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE HEY THEY THEY'RE GONNA GET. YOU HAVE TO SETTLE. OR RISK LOSING THEIR ENTIRE BUSINESS AND SO. YOU KNOW IT BECOMES A MONEY MAKER- IN A WAY THAT I THINK IS NOT VERY JUST YOU KNOW FOR THE BUSINESSES AND FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST TRYING AGAIN AT THAT ARE GOING TO SOME REALLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT NOW SO THAT WOULD BE MY CONCERN. AND JUST TO MAKE SURE IT'S ON THE RECORD MISTER CHAIRMAN I HERE WITH MISTER GALLAGHER ST I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT- THERE ARE FEW THAT JUST LET AGAINST THAT ARE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AT THE BALLOT BOX IN THE CASE OF THE CITY ATTORNEY- THIS INDIVIDUAL MUST GO BEFORE THE VOTERS OF SAN DIEGO EVERY FOUR YEARS. IF THEY'RE IN THIS USING THIS AUTHORITY I SUSPECT THE PUBLIC HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO TAKE TO ALLOW THEM TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE THIS WITH THEIR FINITE RESOURCES. YOU'RE BOTH KNOW WHAT WE'LL GET OUR BUDGET YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THEY'RE HAVING TO DO DOWN THERE AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXCUSE TO OUT BAD ACTORS TO BE HELD ON ACCOUNTABLE. THIS AT LEAST IT GIVES MORE OF A CHANCE THAT SOME OF THESE FOLKS ARE ENGAGING BAD BEHAVIOR HAS SOME RISK OF BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE NOT NECESSARY CARP WANTED RESOURCE THEY'RE STILL LIMITED. BUT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO SHARE THE PROCEEDS OF THIS STUFF TO PICK ME A BURST OF WORKED ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC WITH AN AGENCY DID NOTHING TO ACTUALLY EFFECTUATE THAT POSITIVE OUTCOME. IF YOU MISSED. I'M IS THERE MOTION KNOW THERE'S AN ALL MAKE A MOTION I WANT TO THANK YIELD MISS CORY LIKE HEY WE HAVE A MOST IS THEIR SECOND AND SECOND THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO CO AUTHOR IF POSSIBLE THIS BILL- JUST SO PEOPLE ARE WHERE THE THIS ISN'T A RANDOM DESIGNATION THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS IN THE BNP CODE IT'S ALSO- AND THE LABOR CODE WHICH ALLOWS. ADD THESE LARGER CITIES INCLUDING THE SAN FRANCISCO BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT HAS ALSO THE COUNTY I GUESS THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME I'M REVENUE ISSUE BUT IT WE PROVIDE THE CITIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE THE LOT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT OTHER CITY ATTORNEY STOPPED- THEY CAN'T BRING THESE ACTIONS AND SO IT SEEMS FAIR THAT WHEN THEY- PUT CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES. IN MOST THESE ACTIONS ARE AGAINST BIG CORPORATIONS AND THEY HAVE TO USE CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES IN ORDER TO EVEN LITIGATE IT THAT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY SHOULD GET THE FRUITS OF THAT LABOR ON BACK SO I ABSOLUTELY- APPRECIATED AND APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY HAS DONE AND THAT ENDS UP BEING AND WHEN HE WON'T THESE SORT OF FOR SOME ACTION SAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION COMMENTS. ALRIGHT THIS IS LAURIE I'D I THINK IT'S A IT'S A FIVE BILL AND I FOR ONE DO NOT SEE A CUTS TO PROP. THIS IS. AT A GROUP THAT. COUNTY SAN DIEGO LEASE. DON'T HAVE A QUALM ABOUT MOVING THIS FORWARD AND ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT YOUR- YOUR BILL SO WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU SIR I JUST WANT EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO SERIOUSLY TURNING OUR ELLIOT CAR PARTNERSHIP IN THIS LEGISLATION THANK- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR HER KIND WORDS AND HAPPY TO ADD YOU AND I JUST FOR THE RECORD WOULD POINT OUT THAT AND I SHOULD HAVE. SAID THIS AN ANSWERING MISTER GALLAGHER THE PROCEEDS THAT WOULD COME FROM JUSTIFICATION MUST BE SPENT BY THE CITY ATTORNEY ON ADDITIONAL- THE BUSINESS PRACTICE UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR SMITH SO THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE- A SWEEPSTAKES- FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ASSEMBLY MEANT TO HELP HER DEVELOP HER AND SUCCESSORS DO THEIR JOB- AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IDOL TODAY.

RIGHT THAT BRINGS US TO THE NUMBER EIGHT AB THIRTY TO FIFTY FORM IS THE MOST. OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR AB THIRTY TO FIFTY FOUR. WHEN THEY'RE OPEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB THIRTY TO FIFTY FOUR SIX TO CLARIFY CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. WHEN A CONTRACT IS NEGOTIATED AND WON A FIVE LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH A PHYSICAL CONTRACT MUST BE PROVIDED IN THAT LANGUAGE BUT THIS PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO MONOLINGUAL CLOSE SIGNERS THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE CO SIGNERS HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A SPANISH SPEAKING COSIGNER SIGNS IN ENGLISH CONTRACT THERE HELL TO THE TERMS OF THE ENGLISH CONTRACT WITHOUT THESE PROTECTIONS CO SIGNERS ARE EXTREMELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FRAUD BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AND ARE TAKING ON ALL THE RISK IN ALONE WITHOUT RECEIVING. ANY OF THE BENEFITS IF A CO SIGNER SPEAKS TO ONE OF FIVE LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH THEY WOULD NEED TO RECEIVE AN IN LANGUAGE CONTRACT UNLESS THEY PROVIDE THEIR OWN TRANSLATOR LIKE A FAMILY MEMBER. DUE TO THE CENSUS NEARLY 45% OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS. SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THIS BILL IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF THE I'M PRESIDENT. UNPRECEDENTED RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND COUNTRY. IT IS FORESEEABLE THAT MANY PEOPLE TURN TO PERSONAL LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS WHICH MAY REQUIRE CO SIGNERS TO ADDRESS THE RISING DEBT AND PAY FOR BASIC NEEDS- TODAY ON THE PHONE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IS DANNY CONDO KAISER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. AND DOES RAINY AND- FROM. THE JUSTICE AND DIVERSITY CENTER OF THE BAR ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO. THANK YOU I DO HAVE TO SUPPORT WITNESSES THIS KIND OF KAISER AND MS MILLION NORTH. ARE YOU ON THE LINE PLEASE. YES YES OKAY- THIS KIND OF CLOSER THE- GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNY CANDOR CARTER ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSORS OF THE STILL THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION CLICK OF THE STATEWIDE COALITION OF FOURTEEN LEGALLY PROVIDERS THAT SIR STRIVE TO ENSURE THE ALL CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA HOW THEIR VOICES HEARD BY THE LEGISLATURE WE PART OF FAMILY MEMBER WOMEN'S AUTHORSHIP OF AB THIRTY TO FIFTY FOUR WHICH WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT ANTI FRAUD CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BY REQUIRING THAT NON ENGLISH SPEAKING CO SIGNERS WHO DO NOT HAVE A DISINTEREST. INTERPRETER BE GIVEN A COPY OF THEIR CONTRACT IN THE LANGUAGE THEY SPEAK. CODE SIGNING OF OFTEN LOOK WHEN THE PRIMARY BORROWERS CREDIT IS POOR OR UNDER ESTABLISHED. THE BORROWER IS INCENTIVIZE YOU BRING ON A CO SIGNER IN ORDER TO OBTAIN WHAT HE NEEDS OR WANTS. THE VERY NATURE OF CODE FINDING IS A RELATIONSHIP WHERE IN THE COSIGNER HAVE BETTER CREDIT THAN THE BORROWER. A TAKE ON EQUAL RISK FOR ANOTHER THE BENEFITS AND THEY WILL SUFFER GREATER HARM TO THEIR CREDIT IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. DAMAGE TO ONE CREDIT MAY RESULT IN DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HOUSING AND SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS ATTAINING GOOD PAYING JOBS. AND HIGHER INTEREST RATE COMPUTER LUNCH OR FINANCING. THE COSIGNER MUST CARRY THE FINANCIAL BURDEN IF THE BORROWER DROPS OR SUFFERS THE CONSEQUENCES IF SHE CANNOT AFFORD IT. WITH MANY CALIFORNIANS LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK THE LATTER SCENARIO IS OFTEN THE CASE. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE FOR A MUCH NEEDED YET MODEST EXPANSION OF EXISTING LAW CIVIL CODE SIXTEEN THIRTY TWO WHICH WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX TO INCREASE PROTECTIONS FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING CONSUMERS. UNDER AB THIRTY TO FIFTY FOUR AT THE COSIGNER SPEAKS ONE OF THE FIVE INDICATED LANGUAGES THEY WILL BE GIVEN A CONTRACT IN THAT LANGUAGE UNLESS THEY SUPPLY THEIR OWN DISINTERESTED INTERPRETER. LEAVE PROTECTIONS ARE INTEGRAL TO PROTECTING NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS FROM FRAUD MISREPRESENTATION AND LASTING HARM TO THEIR CREDIT. IN OUR NEW ECONOMIC CLIMB AND WE FOR SEE MORE PEOPLE TAKING UP PERSONAL LOANS AND LINES OF CREDIT.

THAT HAS EIGHT VOTE THANK YOU THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU. IT WAS KILEY. THANKS AS TO ITEM NUMBER NINE AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTY ONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTY ONE. CAROLINE OPEN. MORNING ARE STILL MORE TIMES THE MORNING TOMORROW IF ALL RIGHT IS LEFT. AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTY ONE INSURERS THAT A VICTIM OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT CAN PURSUE A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST THE PERPETRATOR AND OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES. THE BILL WOULD GIVE A MINOR THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT OR JUST A FORM OF THE PROVISION IN IN A ROMAN AGREEMENT FOR THEIR SCHOOL THE DENIES THEM ANY LEGAL RIGHT REMEDY FOR- PROCEEDING OR PROCEDURE FOR A SPECIFIC TYPE OF CLAIM ONE ARISING OUT OF A CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT OR BATTERY. IN OUR CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM. COURTS ARE THE DEFAULT FORUM FOR EDUCATING LEGAL CLAIMS. YET PARTIES CAN OFFICE TO CHANGE THAT TO FALL AND MANY DO. WHEN ENTERING A CONTRACTOR THE AGREED TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES THAT MAY ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP. THROUGH AN ALTERNATIVE FORUM SUCH AS ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION OFFERS A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES OVER LITIGATION INCLUDING COSTS SPEED ND PRIVACY. THAT'S WHY IT'S FAVORED UNDER BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. WE GENERALLY RESPECT THE RIGHT OF CONTRACTING PARTIES TO INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN THEIR AGREEMENT WHICH BINDS THEM TO A CHANGE IN THE DEFAULT FORUM FOR RESOLVING CLAIMS IN ADVANCE OF ANY DISPUTE. BUT THIS PRINCIPLE IS POORLY ADAPTED TO THE NARROW AND UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE PRESENTED HERE. WHERE THE AGENT OF AN EDUCATION ESTABLISHMENT HAS COMMITTED A HEINOUS ACT OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST A MINOR ENTRUSTED TO ITS CARE. AS AN INITIAL MATTER SCHOOLING IS COMPULSORY FOR A MINOR THERE MAY BE A CHOICE OF WHICH SCHOOL TO ATTEND BUT THERE'S NO CHOICE WHETHER TO ATTEND SCHOOL ALL TOGETHER. SECOND IF THE SCHOOL SELECTED REQUIRES AN ORAL AGREEMENT THE MINOR DOES NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACT HIM OR HERSELF BUT IS BOUND BY THE SIGNATURE OF THE PARENT. THIRD A CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT IS NOT AMONG THE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RISKS OF ENROLLMENT. TERMS AND CONDITIONS LIKE SCHOOL HOURS TUITION DRESS CODES GRADING STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS LIKE TUITION ATTENDANCE THESE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AGREEMENT. THE ONE COULD REASONABLY ANTICIPATE AS THE BASIS FOR ANY DISPUTE. MIDDLE SEXUAL ASSAULT IS AN INJURY OF AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT KIND THAT WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION BY A REASONABLE PARENT MUCH LESS BY A MINOR STUDENT WHO LIKELY WAS NOT AWARE OF THE CAUSE OR THE CONCEPT OF ARBITRATION AT ALL. IT IS TRUE THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT HAS A BROADLY PREEMPTIVE THE FACT. ON STATE LAWS LIMITING ARBITRATION. BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A MINOR CAN DECIPHER MY CONTRACT THAT'S A DISTINCT QUESTION OF STATE LAW AND NOT GOVERNED BY THE FAA ITSELF. CALIFORNIA LAW IN FACT ALREADY ALLOWS JUST AFFIRMING CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL CONTACTS. WELL IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A COURT WOULDFIND NEVER THE LESS THAT AB EIGHT THREE TWO SEVEN ONE IMPERMISSIBLY FAVORS ARBITRATION THIS FAVORS ARBITRATION IN A WAYTHAT TRIGGERS FAA PREVENT PREEMPTION I AM. NOT AWARE OF ANY EXISTING PRECEDENT TO THAT EFFECT AND I BELIEVE THE ARGUMENT FOR A CONTRARY HOLDING IS COMPELLING GIVEN THE BILL'S NARROW SCOPE AND THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES IT ADDRESSES NAMELY- THE BILL CREATES A RIGHTS INTO JUST A FIRM. THAT IS NOT TARGETED AT ARBITRATION AS SUCH BUT IS LIMITED TO THAT PORTION OF AN ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT- WHERE JUST AFFIRMING- THE CONTRACT IS- WORKABLE AND REASONABLE IN OTHER WORDS- WE I WOULDN'T BE REASONABLE TO HAVE A STUDENT BE ABLE TO SIMPLY- DISA FIRM THEIR ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT AT ANY POINT BECAUSE THEY COULD JUST YOU COULD JUMP BUT DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL WHATEVER THEY WANTED- BUT IN THE- I HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND HIGHLY. INJURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENTED BY THIS BILL IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DECIPHER THE PART OF THE CONTRACT THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO BE DRESSING THAT INJURY- SO- WITH THAT SAID I RESPECT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WHO ARE ON THE LINE. THANK YOU I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES RICHARDS WORDS AND STEPHEN SCHWARTZ. ONLINE ARE YOU WITH US. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS RICHARD SCHWARTZ. FOR I'M HERE- I REBEKAH SCHWARTZ SEEKING UP OR- EVEN SHORT OKAY- MISTER RICHARD SCHWARTZ FIRST PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS KILEY IN PARTICULAR MY NAME IS RICHARD SCHWARTZ A PARTNER AT THE LAW FIRM BROWN GEORGE ROCK L. L. P. AND I HEARD YOU ALL CANNELLA AYE ON A. B. THIRTY TWO SEVENTY ONE. AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTY ONE WOULD ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE THE VICTIMS AND CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SEXUAL BATTERY IN A SCHOOL CONTACT EACH OTHER THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM EVEN IF THE SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT WOULD OTHERWISE SEND THAT STUDENT ARBITRATION. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA LAW AUTHORIZES SCHOOL TOOK FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS TO SIGN. NON NEGOTIABLE ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT. STOP AND HAVE. THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS ALLOW THOSE TO HIDE IT. BEHIND THE VEIL CONFIDENTIAL. EVEN WHEN A STUDENT HAS CLAIMS BASED ON PROVEN CRIMINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. THE SECRECY THAT SCHOOLS CAN REQUIRE THROUGH FORCED ARBITRATION IS THAT SPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR SCHOOL COMMUNITY. WHO DESPERATELY NEED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT PROCEDURES THEIR SCHOOLS ARE TAKING FOR FAILING TO TAKE TO PREVENT CRIMINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ON THEIR PREMISES. EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC IS THE IMPACT OF ARBITRATION ON A VICTIM OF CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT. CALIFORNIA LAW MAKES IT CLEAR THAT AN ARBITRATOR CAN DECIDE A MATTER BEFORE THEM NOT ON THE BASIS OF THE RULE OF LAW OR THE RULES OF EVIDENCE. RATHER SOLELY ON AMBIGUOUS NOTIONS OF EQUITY AS PERCEIVED BY THAT ARBITRATOR OFTEN A SINGLE PERSON WITH HIS OR HER OWN BIASES AND PRECONCEPTIONS. THAT MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR CAN BLATANTLY IGNORE THE LAW AND PREVENT IT STUDENT WHO IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED FROM OBTAINING THE JUSTICE THEY COULD OBTAIN THROUGH THE COURTS. AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTY ONE WOULD FIX THAT PROBLEM BY ALLOWING STUDENTS TO DEATH THE FIRM THOSE ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT AFTER BEING THE VICTIM OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT. I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTY ONE HAS A VERY NARROW SCOPE AND PROVISIONS ARE ONLY TRIGGERED WHEN THERE IS CRIMINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT FORM THE BASIS OF DISPUTED CLAIM. CALIFORNIA CONVICTED WILL ALL THAT ALLOW SCHOOLS TO ESCAPE THE COURT SYSTEM AND AVOID THE PUBLIC RECONCILIATION PROCESS THAT THESE COMMUNITIES NEED TO HEAL AND MOVE ON. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND THE IMPORTANT BILL WHICH WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO SECURING JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS OF CRIMINAL OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. I ASK YOU TO THE MEMBERS ABOUT AYE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU THE WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY FOR HEARING THE VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE ON A SUBJECT IMPORTANT TO PUBLIC SAFETY IT IS AN HONOR BY COMING FORWARD WE CHOOSE TO STAND UP FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY TO LOWER THE RISK OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN BEING EXPOSED TO SEXUAL PREDATORS IN OUR SCHOOL. THIS IS NOT BEEN THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE AMONG THE MANY UGLY TRUTH WE HAVE LEARNED ON THIS JOURNEY IS THAT MANY WOULD PREFER THIS ISSUE NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. THERE ARE FEW THINGS WORSE THAN HARMING A CHILD. ONE MIGHT BE PREVENTING THAT SHOCKING SEEKING JUSTICE FOR THAT HARM IGNORING THAT IT EVER HAPPENED. FOUR YEARS AGO OUR CHILD WAS REPEATEDLY AND BRUTALLY RAPED BY A TEACHER AT REDWOOD SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES NEARLY EVERY DAY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BOTH ON AND OFF CAMPUS. RVTRADER REMOTELY CONVICTED AND SERVING TIME. OUR CHILD HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY CHANGED DAMAGED AND SCARRED BY THE THEORIES OF A FAULT. THE ANGUISH PAIN AND MISERY COUPLED WITH THE LOSS OF INNOCENCE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGING. HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT OUR CHARLES NEVER GOT THE PROVERBIAL DAY IN COURT. A JURY TRIAL WOULD BE IN ONE WAY TO BRING ABOUT A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE CRIME AND SCHOOLED POLICIES PROCEDURES GUIDELINES GOVERNANCE AND CULTURE WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRIME. INSTEAD THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM DID NOT A TRIAL THE JURY TRIAL BECAUSE OF A MANDATORY CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN BRENTWOOD SCHOOL INVOLVEMENT IN GREEN MINT. ARE TWELVE NOT SIGNED AN AGREEMENT AND YET WHAT HELP TO IT. MY HUSBAND AND I FIND THAT AGREEMENT BELIEVING THAT MOST ARBITRATION WOULD COVER GRIEVANCES WE MIGHT HAVE WITH THE SCHOOL REGARDING OUR TRIAL EDUCATION. WE NEVER ENVISIONED IT WOULD COVER A FELONY CRIME AND WE CERTAINLY NEVER ENVISIONED THAT WE WERE SIGNING AWAY ARE TWELFTH RIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN PATH TO JUSTICE. NO PARENT DOES OR SHOULD. THE CONTENT THE PARENT TO FIND YOU THE PREMIUM IS THAT ARBITRATION IS INTENDED TO RESOLVE DISPUTES RELATED TO ATTENDING A SCHOOL LIKE THIS AGREEMENT ABOUT A GREAT ORANGE ON. ARBITRATION CERTAINLY HAS PLACE TO DOUBLE CHECK SYSTEM BUT WAIT FIFTEEN SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ARBITRATION OR COURT. APPLYING THE ARBITRATION QUALITY EDUCATORS SEXUAL ABUSE OF A CHILD AT THE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE ANY CHANCE OF TRUE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. ARBITRATION THAT IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AND REPORTEDLY LIMIT DISCOVERY IN DISCLOSURE IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE SEXUAL FALL VICTIM BUT ALSO FOR SOCIETY.

DISCUSSIONS WITH US ON THIS POINT- I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. AND BUT BECAUSE I THINK THATFOR THE THROWN OUT THAT AGREE WITH THAT THE MAJORITY AT THE K. POP CITED- AND STAFF POINT TO THE ISSUE AT ALL ON A LOT OF FOR YOU SIMPLY PUT OUR CONCERN IS THAT- THIS BILL IS TOTALLY PREEMPTED. SEVEN OKAY MATTER HAD THAT- I THINK THE LINE THAT THE THUMBS UP ARE CONCERNED- THREE COURTS TWENTY ELEVEN KT EIGHTY ANTI MOBILITY BECAUSE THAT THE ON. THE COURT SAID. QUOTE PERMIT.

FORCED ARBITRATION BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN A NOT EVEN GIVEN A HEARING AND IN FEDERAL COURT BASICALLY WITH WITH BEING- AN INJUNCTION BUT I THINK IT'S A START AND I THINK EVERY TIME WE CAN PASS A BILL THAT MAKES SENSE- WE CAN TACKLE. THE USE OF FORCED ARBITRATION AND SOME I'M HAPPY THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT- AYE AYE IT AMAZES ME YOU'RE DOING THIS BILL GIVEN THAT YOU VOTED AGAINST MY CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT BILL- LAST YEAR BUT YOU KNOW IT.

I ABSOLUTELY- I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I THANK YOU FOR LOOKING OUT FOR VICTIMS. THANK YOU THERE'S A MOST IS THEIR SECOND. AND THE SECOND THANK YOU. FOR THE COMMENTS WAS TOGETHER. YEAH THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL IT AND THIS GOES TO- WE HAD A SIMILAR- BILL A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE- BUT WE YOU KNOW WE PUT A LOT OF FOCUS ON. PRIVATE ENTITIES SOME PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS- YOU KNOW I CAN THINK OF IS THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. ONE OF THEM AND THE THINGS THAT THEY HAD DONE TO. COVER UP TO MOVE PEOPLE AROUND- TO AVOID DISCOVERY OF THESE EGREGIOUS INJURIOUS SEXUAL ASSAULTS- THAT WORKER ON PEOPLE AND WHAT WE WILL WE HAVE NOT PUT ENOUGH FOCUSING ATTENTION ON. IS THE PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT HAVE DONE VERY SIMILAR THINGS AND THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTLESS. THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTLESS INCIDENTS OF TEACHERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED THESE TYPES OF ACTS AND THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN DONE THINGS HAVE BEEN COVERED UP THINGS HAVE BEEN- YOU KNOW NOT DONE PROPERLY- TO THE INSURED ESTES AN- AND A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS. AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE WE CANNOT ALLOW SOMETHING TO BE PUT UP YOUR BECAUSE SOMETHING'S A PUBLIC ENTITY- A WALL TO BE PUT UP- TO JUSTICE AND SO I THINK THIS IS VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH THAT- SEVEN MEMBER WICKS IS BILL- THAT MOVED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TWO WEEKS TWO WEEKS AGO IS VERYMUCH AND- IN LINE WITH THAT DEALING WITH UCLA- SO. WE DO NEED TO REALLY START PUTTING THE FOCUS ON THAT THERE SHOULD BE IT SHOULD NOT MATTER WHETHER YOU ARE A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE AND IT IT YOU DID THESE KINDS OF. IS IF YOU ALLOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN WHERE YOU KNOW WITH THIS YOUNG. YOUNG MAN. THERE SHOULD NOT BE A PET IMMENSE- TO JUSTICE AND I AND I ALSO AGREE WITH THE WITH YOUR- VIEW POINT- MISTER KILEY THAT. THIS IS NOT A CONTRACTUAL SITUATION YOU KNOW SCHOOL IS COMPULSORY NOW THERE'S NOT THERE'S NOT REALLY A THIS IS NOT A- BE A WILLING VOLUNTARY TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE STUDENTS SCHOOL WE WANT ALL OF OUR KIDS IN SCHOOL. AND SO CAN WE REALLY ALLOW THESE AND ROAMING AGREEMENTS- THAT THE KID LIKELY NEVER EVEN SIGNED HIS PARENTS SIGNED- BE THE THING THAT KEEPS.

AND MISTER CHAIRMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED WITH YOUR NEXT BILL THANK YOU AB THIRTY THREE SIXTY SIX DEALS WITH JUDICIAL EMERGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA UNDER CURRENT LAW THE CHIEF JUSTICE MAY ISSUE ORDERS TO MODIFY COURT RULES AND PROCEDURES DURING A DECLARED EMERGENCY. BUT UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION SIXTY EIGHT ONE ONE FIVE IT ONLY ALLOWS CHIEF JUSTICE TO ISSUE ORDERS AFFECTING A SINGLE COUNTY UPON THE REQUEST OF THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THAT COUNTY AND AS WE SAW WITH THE STATE WIDE EPIDEMIC OR- THAT WITH THIS STATEWIDE EPIDEMIC WERE WITH A DISASTER THAT COVERS MULTIPLE COUNTIES THAT LAW IS ENOUGH REALLY WORKABLE AND IN FACT FOR THEIR CURRENT PANDEMIC. THE GOVERNOR HAD TO ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IN ORDER TO GIVE THESE. ABILITIES TO THE CHIEF JUSTIC THIS BILL MERELY PROVIDES FOR A STATEWIDE WHERE YOU MULTI COUNTY ABILITY FOR THE CHIEF JUSTICE. TO BE ABLE TO DO. MODIFY PROCEDURES IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT JUSTICE HAPPENS THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR COURTS THIS IS A SIMPLE BUT PRETTY IMPORTANT MEASURE. AND YOU'LL NOTICE THIS THIS BILL WITH HAD WAS HAS BEEN HEAVILY AMENDED SO THE BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH BOTH SIDES AND IN SUPPORT WE HAVE WITNESSES FROM BOTH THE CONSUMER TOURNEY'S AND THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL.

ADEQUATE AUTHORITY AND WOULD THAT FORCE TO WAIT FOR VARIOUS REQUEST AN INDIVIDUAL COURT IN FACT I BELIEVE SHE RESPONDED. TO OVER A HUNDRED REQUIRED HIM INDIVIDUAL COURT AND THEN- SHE HAD TO WAIT FOR AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AUTHORITY FROM THE GOVERNOR- THAT MEANT THAT THE COURT LOST SOME TIME. THE FIRST THE CASES AND IS A RESULT OF THIS OF CLEAR AUTHORITY FOR A PANDEMIC SOME OF THE BACKLOG- THAT WE ARE NOW FACING FOR ACCESS TO JOB TO HAVE INCREASED SO GOING FORWARD WE THINK IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE HAVE. STATEWIDE AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH THE STATEWIDE EMERGENCY. THANK YOU. AND MISTER KERIK MIKE BELOW TWENTY OF THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL. FOLLOWING UP ON MS GRAVELS COMMENTS THIS WAS A LESSON FROM THE PANDEMIC AND WE'RE LEARNING LOTS OF LESSONS- THIS IS NOT INTERROGATION OF A PRESIDING JUDGES ABILITY TO TAILOR.
