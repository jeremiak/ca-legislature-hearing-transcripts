POCKETBOOKS OF THE IF THE- IF

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:30.216
THE FEDS CUT OFF THIS IS SO.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.018
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND SO I'M

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.119
GLAD TO SEE THAT IT'S INCLUDED

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:36.522
IN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. DR PAN.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.558
I THANK YOU AND FIRST OF ALL I

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:40.993
DO APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL FROM

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.129
THE- ADMINISTRATION OF THE MAY

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:45.097
REVISE- TO RESTORE THE-

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:46.833
ESSENTIALLY A PREVIOUS SUBSIDY

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.569
PROGRAM WE HAD BEFORE THE-

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.270
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT. BUT I

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:53.039
GUESS THE QUESTION I WOULD POSE

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:55.341
AND I DON'T KNOW THEIR- PERHAPS

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.776
COVER CALIFORNIA MIGHT BE THE

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.144
ONE MOST APPROPRIATELY TO ANSWER

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:02.415
THIS SO MY CONCERN IS THAT. AT

00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:04.417
LEAST FROM MY UNDERSTANDING-

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:07.386
THE- THIS COMPONENT THE IN THE

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:09.222
AMERICAN RESCUE PLANS AT THE

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:11.023
SUBSIDIES FOR. ESSENTIALLY

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.491
COVERED CALIFORNIA THE LARGER X.

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.327
YA OVER OVERALL THROUGH THE ARE

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:16.896
BUT THAT THAT DOES ACTUALLY

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:17.930
FAIRLY AS YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.899
FAIRLY BROAD SUPPORT FOR THAT-

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.834
NOW IT WAS PUT LUMP BILLS PUT IN

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.302
THIS PART BILL BACK BETTER PLAN

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.037
SO AND THAT YOU KNOW HAS HAD

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:28.074
PROBLEMS AND THAT'S WHY THERE

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.442
HASN'T BEEN ACTION TAKEN- SO.

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:30.509
THERE IS POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.478
ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AT THE

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.646
END OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE ARE

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.281
BOTH COURTS WOULD END AT THE END

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.985
OF. DECEMBER SO THERE IS

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:41.320
UNCERTAINTY. THE ISSUE I GUESS

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:43.489
SAID RAISES THAT IN THIS PERHAPS

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:44.757
AGAIN THIS QUESTION FOR COERED

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.959
CALIFORNIA IS THAT. NOW YOU'RE

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.828
NEGOTIATING THE RATES WITH THE

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:55.501
PLANS OVER THE SUMMER. CORRECT.

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:57.036
AND I AS YOU REVEL EVERY

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.672
CALIFORNIA YES WE ARE YES SO I

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:03.309
GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT WHY

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.944
APPRECIATE THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.046
. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AND

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:09.248
BASICALLY THE PLANS LOOKING AS A

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:09.849
OKAY THERE'S A POSSIBILITY ARE

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:11.617
BUT GOES AWAY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:13.452
DOESN'T TAKE ANY ACTION. THERE

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.253
WHILE THERE WILL BE SOME

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.322
SUBSIDIES IN CALIFORNIA THERE

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.723
ARE DEFINITELY BE A DROP THEY'LL

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.226
STILL BE A BIT OF A CLIFF FOR

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.627
OUR- YOU KNOW FOR THE PEOPLE

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:22.828
WERE FOUR HUNDRED PROBABLY A

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.031
LAUGH THE L. LESS OF A CLIFF

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.432
THAN THEY WOULD HAD BEEN WITHOUT

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.900
THIS ACTION. BUT SO FAR AND THAT

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.001
WOULD ACTUALLY PUT UPWARD

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.636
PRESSURE ON PREMIUMS AND EVEN IF

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.171
CONGRESS TO SAY THE ACT LET'S

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.906
SEE AS IN THE LAME DUCK SESSION

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:36.442
AND EXTEND THIS BECAUSE THIS IS

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:37.043
A FAIRLY. THIS IS A FAIRLY

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:38.711
POPULAR PROVISION. WE WOULD

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:41.047
STILL BE STUCK WITH INCREASED

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:42.648
RATES BECAUSE THE RATES WERE A

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.184
NEGOTIATED IN THE FALL AND IT

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.452
FACT. THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.987
RATE INCREASES OF COURSE WILL BE

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:50.489
COMING OUT WHEN WE'RE DOING OPEN

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:51.757
ENROLLMENT RIGHT BEFORE. LET'S

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.392
JUST SAY- WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.895
NOVEMBER- MAYBE LATE OCTOBER

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:58.664
NOVEMBER- NOT SURE WHY THAT

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.466
PARTICULAR TIME THE YEAR MIGHT

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:00.967
BE REALLY IMPORTANT BUT

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.669
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT- SO.

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:06.806
MMHM SO ZIGGY'S TO WHAT YOU

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:09.809
THINK MAY HAPPEN AGAIN I KNOW

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:10.876
YOU HAVEN'T NEGOTIATE BUT YOU

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:14.080
KNOW- I GUESS THE MOST WAS LIKE.

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:17.216
IF THE STATE STEPPED UP AND

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.186
PROVIDED. NOT LEAST ONE MORE

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:24.090
YEAR- SOME INCREASE SUBSIDY- FOR

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.058
AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR SO I'VE

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:26.826
BEGIN PREHEAT THE NEXT RACES

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:29.161
PROPOSAL FOR THE FOR DOING THE

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:30.763
ON GOING YOU KNOW PREVIOUS OF

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.431
THE PROGRAM AND ONGOING SO AGAIN

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:34.100
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.768
GUESS I WOULD OPEN THE IDEA

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.536
SAYING THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD DO A

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:39.005
LITTLE MORE FOR THE COMING YEAR.

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:41.374
YOU KNOW BUT AGAIN IN THE HOPES

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.908
THAT CONGRESS WILL STEP UP AND

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:44.910
THEN OUR VOTERS BUT ALSO TO

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:47.046
ANOTHER TO PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:48.647
ON PREMIUMS WHILE COVERED

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:50.082
CALIFORNIA NEGOTIATED PREMIUMS

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.384
OF THE SUMMER TO MAKE THAT

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.285
COMMITMENT IN CASE OUR BUT

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:56.689
DOESN'T GO. SO IS THAT A IS THAT

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.157
A VALID. CONCERN I MEAN WHEN

00:10:58.224 --> 00:10:59.225
COVERED CALIFORNIA'S NEGOTIATING

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:00.760
WITH THIS PLANTS ESTABLISHED A

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:03.396
RATES FOR NEXT OPEN ENROLLMENT-

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:04.563
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.067
HAPPEN. AND THIS IS A VERY VALID

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:09.835
CONCERN WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:12.238
THIS CONTINGENCY AS BEST AS WE

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:13.773
CAN. I'M NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.307
WE'VE BEEN IN THIS POSITION WE

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:17.043
ARE IN THIS POSITION IN THE

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:18.110
FIRST YEAR OF THE TRUMP

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:18.911
ADMINISTRATION. BUT WE HAVE

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:20.112
ASKED OUR CARRIERS TO PREPARE

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.314
THEIR RATES ASSUMING THAT

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.251
CURRENT LAW- THAT COMES TO PASS

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:27.720
SO A. R. P. AB PREMIUM SUBSIDIES

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.722
EXPIRE. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:31.524
BEEN ASKED TO SUBMIT TO US IS

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.659
THEIR INITIAL RATES. WE'VE ALSO

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.227
ASKED THEM TO SHARE WITH US

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:37.063
AFFECTED BY WHICH RATES MIGHT

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:39.031
DROP IF A. R. P. SUBSIDIES ARE

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:41.600
CONTINUED SO. AS WE'RE IN THE

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.836
COURSE OF THE SUMMER AND AS WE

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:45.104
WORK WITH OUR REGULATOR PARTNERS

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.405
AND WE HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:47.940
HAVE DIFFERENT SETS OF RATES AND

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.041
TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THEM TO

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:50.810
CONSUMERS BASED ON. THE ACTION

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:53.579
THAT THE CONGRESS TAKES BUT I

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:54.146
THINK YOU FLAG THE REALLY

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:56.649
IMPORTANT- INFLECTION POINT IN

00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:59.685
THE TIME LINE WHICH IS IF WE GET

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.153
INTO OCTOBER. WHEN WE START OUR

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.655
RENEWAL PROCESSES WHEN WE

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:05.024
STARTED TELL CONSUMERS WHETHER

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.592
TWENTY TWENTY THREE RATES ARE

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:07.793
GOING TO BE. AND AT THAT POINT

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.096
WE ARE MUCH MORE LOCKED IN A

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:11.730
LESS ABLE TO PAY THAT AND THEN

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:13.099
TO YOUR POINT WE MAY HAVE LOCKED

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:15.534
IN ARTIFICIALLY HIGH RATES IF

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:17.203
THEY'RE P. SUBSIDIES ARE THEN

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:18.637
EXTENDED IN THE LAME DUCK

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.840
SESSION SO. THAT THAT IS NOT A

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:22.942
GOOD CASE SCENARIO BUT WE ARE

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:24.777
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:27.413
MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IN THAT

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.013
SCENARIO OKAY SO I APPRECIATE

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.949
THAT SO I GUESS I WOULD SUGGEST

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:30.950
CONSIDERATION AND AGAIN PRECIADO

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:32.284
WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED I

00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:33.686
WOULD SUGGEST CONSIDERATION OF

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:38.157
PERHAPS A- ONE TIME ONE YEAR.

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:39.024
YOU KNOW CROSS OUR FINGERS ON A.

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:42.528
R. P. COMMITMENT FOR SUBSIDIES

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:47.933
FOR ANOTHER YEAR- TO TRY TO PUT

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.169
THAT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:54.807
RATES. SIR WHAT WOULD BE A

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:55.841
YOU'RE- OLD. THE PREVIOUS OF.

00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:58.010
AND HOW THAT CAN WILL DO RIGHT

00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:59.778
THING TURNS OUT AND J. WE CAN DO

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:00.846
A BUDGET LETTER WHAT TURNS OUT

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:02.815
WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO USE THAT

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:04.950
MONEY BUT THAT BUT THEN WHICH IS

00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:06.085
WE DON'T LOCK IN THE HIGHER

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:06.919
RATES BECAUSE EVEN IF CONGRESS

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.954
ACTS. IN THE LAME DUCK SESSION

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:10.389
WE WERE LOCKED IN THE HIGHER

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.091
RATES. SO I JUST WANT YOU KNOW

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:13.893
I'M I THINK ABOUT. OUR

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:14.760
COMMITMENT TO PUT IN SOME

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:15.895
ADDITIONAL MONEY WE MAY ACTUALLY

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:18.330
GET YOU KNOW THE SAID THAT EVERY

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:18.964
DOLLAR COMMITMENT WE ACTUALLY

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.232
MAY GET A BIGGER BANG FOR A

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.734
BUCK. GOING BACK YOU KNOW IN

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.335
RETURN. BECAUSE OF THE DOWNWARD

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:24.870
PRESSURE WE COULD PLAY ON RATES

00:13:24.937 --> 00:13:26.005
DURING NEGOTIATION OVER THE

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:27.673
SUMMER. SO SO HOPING I WANT TO.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.974
PUT THAT IDEA OUT THERE. AS WE

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.442
WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR OUR

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:32.211
BUDGET AND I BELIEVE IN THIS.

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.279
REGIONAL CENTER PROPOSAL WE DID

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:35.047

LITTLE MORE- THAN WHAT'S BEING

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.520
PROPOSED IN THE REVISED. SO

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:42.588
HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE THAT

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.156

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:07.015
RELATIONSHIP OVER AND OVER AGAIN

01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:07.849
WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT

01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:09.584
AGENCIES DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:12.020
THAT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT YOU

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:15.723
KNOW. BEING ABLE TO. HAVE A

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.692

BE HELPFUL SO AND SO TO ME THE I

01:28:38.012 --> 01:28:38.980

ADVANTAGES BUT I DO APPRECIATE

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:42.650
ALEJO'S POINT THAT WHAT WE DON'T

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:43.985
WANT TO DO IS BECOME SO

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:46.688
SEPARATED FROM. THE GROUPS THAT

IN THE- YOU KNOW IN THE

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.808
ORGANIZATION CHART THAT- THAT IT

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:08.409
MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:11.546

SHIFT DURING THE PANDEMIC SO I

01:30:55.483 --> 01:30:57.218
THINK THERE'S STILL. THE

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.052
EXPECTATION THAT THERE WILL BE

01:30:58.119 --> 01:30:59.987

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:25.813
POINT BILLION AND- LIST SOME

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.248

PARTICULARLY CHILDREN IS STILL

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:43.431
FAIRLY LOW I THINK IT'S ONLY 36%

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:45.399
FOR FIVE TO ELEVEN. FOR

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:46.968
