AHEAD ALL RIGHT WITH THANK YOU

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:18.610
MADAM CHAIR- SO MY

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.511
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE BILL

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:24.983
PROVIDES UP 280% IS IT UP 280%

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:25.583
OR IS IT EIGHTY PERCENT. YEAH

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:31.889
I'D- FOR. RENDERERS HI AT 80%

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.958
SO IT'S A FIX 30% BUT THAT'S

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:34.792
THAT'S GONNA BE APPORTIONED

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:37.629
AGAINST A FINITE AMOUNT OF

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:39.264
FEDERAL FUNDS CORRECT. YEAH

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.199
THAT IS BASED ON THAT- ONE

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:44.168
POINT FIVE BILLION- ONE POINT

00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:44.769
FIVE BILLION THAT THE STATE IS

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:47.071
CURRENTLY GETTING. CHAU DO WE

00:31:47.138 --> 00:31:50.041
HAVE SOME ASSURANCE. THAT THE

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:52.176
FUNDS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO

00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:54.212
ADDRESS THE REAR EDGE ACROSS

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:57.649
THE STATE. AND WHAT WOULD HAVE

00:31:57.715 --> 00:32:00.952
BEEN BETTER TRANSACTION- B. THE-

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.086
I BELIEVE FINANCE WOULD SAY

00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:05.223
THAT THE ARREARS- THERE'S NO

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.791
WAY AT THIS POINT TO REALLY

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:07.925
DETERMINE WHAT THOSE ARREARS

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:10.828
ARE- POTENTIALLY THEY COULD BE

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:13.197
AT A CELLULAR STATED BEFORE

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:15.066
HUNDRED MILLION- MAYBE EVEN

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:16.434
NEED WE THINK THAT'S IN THE

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:18.202
LOWER END COULD BE HIGHER- AND

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:20.705
SO THIS IS A FINITE AMOUNT OF

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.240
MONEY IT WILL GO BASED ON THE

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:23.574
ROUNDS HAS DEVELOPED THROUGH

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:26.744
THIS PROGRAM- AND AGAIN WE WILL

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:28.479
WE ARE CONTINUING CONTINUALLY

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:30.515
AS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM AGENCY

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:32.283
SIDE. I'M LOOKING FOR-

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.351
ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:34.652
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ANY

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:36.954
IF IT'S IF IT'S A FIXED PAYMENT

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:38.956
OF 80% AND THAT IS A CLEAR AS A

00:32:39.023 --> 00:32:41.159
VERY OF ITS IT IT'LL BASICALLY

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:41.859
FIRST COME FIRST SERVE WILL

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:43.795
WILL WILL TO DISPATCH DISPERSES

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:48.399
MONEY UNTIL SUCH TIME. AS WE'VE

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.134
EXHAUSTED THE FUNDS- WELL THAT

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:52.036
IT IS A AT FINITE AMOUNT OF A

00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:53.671
DOLLAR TO PER ITSELF THE SET UP

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:55.540
TO. GO OUT AND BROWN'S SO THE

00:32:55.606 --> 00:32:57.742
FIRST ROUND WOULD REALLY BE-

00:32:57.809 --> 00:32:59.377
HITTING THE NEEDIEST-

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:01.779
HOUSEHOLDS SO THOSE UNDER 50%

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:04.716
AREA MEDIAN INCOME- AND THE

00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:06.284
SECOND ROUND WOULD EXPAND THAT.

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:08.119
A BIT AND THE THIRD ROUND AS

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:11.789
WELL BUT JUST WANTING TO KNOW-THAT THE IDEA IS TO BE

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:12.824
EQUITABLE IN TERMS OF

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.759
DISTRIBUTION. BUT ALSO TO HIT

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.561
WHERE THE NEED IS MOST. AND

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:18.229
THAT IS WHAT WILL GO OUT IN

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.131
ROUND ONE OF THIS PROGRAM I

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:23.868
DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:24.435
COLLEAGUES FROM AGENCY HAVE

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:25.636
ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. I'M

00:33:25.703 --> 00:33:27.905
SURE I CAN TRAIN IN- THIS AMY

00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:31.342
WILSON AGAIN- FROM AGENCY. A

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:34.379
GOOD AFTERNOON US SENATOR- I

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:36.147
WANTED TO JUST ADD OR

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:39.984
EMPHASIZE- THAT- THE PROGRAM IS

00:33:40.051 --> 00:33:42.854
DESIGNED TO- START FIRST WITH

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.791
ELIGIBILITY- AND- THEN- MOVE

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:49.427
FORWARD IN AT DIFFERENT LAYERS

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:50.128
OF PRIORITIZATION AS ERICA

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:52.897
DESCRIBED. WITH THE ROUNDS-

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:57.068
AND- WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID A

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:58.469
SITUATION OF FIRST COME FIRST

00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:01.606
SERVE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:04.142
THAT- NOT ALWAYS YOU KNOW THAT

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:06.210
SOMETIMES IT TAKES SOME TIME TO

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:08.312
REACH DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES-

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:10.982
AND- THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:13.184
MAY BE NECESSARY TO REACH THOSE

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:15.953
COMMUNITIES. AND YOU KNOW TO

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.289
MAKE SURE THAT- THOSE IN NEED

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:22.794
ARE APPLYING- AND SO THE-

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.096
THEREFORE THE IDEA OF HAVING

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:27.098
THESE- KIND OF. BACKGROUNDS OF

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:29.233
PEOPLE CAN APPLY AT ANY TIME IN

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.402
THE AND BE ORGANIZED INTO

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.371
ROUNDS BASED ON WHERE THEY FALL

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:34.906
INTO THE ELIGIBILITY CATEGORY.

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:36.574
I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL THAT IS

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:37.809
VERY HELPFUL SO THAT THAN WITH

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.944
RESPECT TO ELIGIBILITY AT MY

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.078
UNDERSTAND GUYS THAT THE

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:43.548
THRESHOLD IS 80% OF AMI'S TO

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:45.383
CORRECT FOR IT AT THE AT THE

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:49.821
HIGHEST. YES SIR- BUT THAT THE

00:34:49.887 --> 00:34:54.525
FOCUS IS THE FEDERAL LAW- AT

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:57.862
EMPHASIZES A PRIOR TO USING.

00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:00.264
50% AND UNDER BUT BUT YOU CAN

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:02.467
GO UP AS HIGH AS EIGHTY IS MY

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:03.801
GUESS. SO IS TO THEN THERE

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:05.036
THERE'S THEIR SERVICE SEPARATE

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:07.004
FROM WHICH- THERE ARE SOME

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:09.407
LARGE NUMBER OF. TENANTS WHO

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:10.942
HAVE NOT PAID RENT WHO WHO

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:12.877
SUGGESTED MEDIAN INCOME IS

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:14.912
HIGHER THAN 80% DOES THIS

00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:17.281
LEGISLATION MAKE ANY PROVISIONS-

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:17.882
OR IS THERE ANY ALLOCATION FOR

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.650
LANDLORDS WHO MIGHT. IHAVE NOT

00:35:19.717 --> 00:35:22.353
RECEIVED A REQUEST FROM TENANTS

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.955
WHO ARE ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD.

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:26.991
WELL I SHOULDN'T. QUALIFY THAT

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:30.795
THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF WAYS TO-

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:34.365
DEMONSTRATE. ELIGIBILITY AND SO

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:36.501
IN ADDITION TO THAT 80% FIFTY

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:39.770
PERCENT- THERE IS- AN UNNAMED.

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:41.772
BEING UNEMPLOYED FOR A CERTAIN

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:44.909
NUMBER OF MONTHS- IN THIS

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:47.411
RECENT CALENDAR YEAR- AND SO

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:50.047
THAT IS ONE OTHER WAY BUT

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:50.948
UNFORTUNATELY THE FEDERALIZED.

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:52.750
IS IT A FAKE ABOUT THAT 80% AND

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:54.285
OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE THIS

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:55.653
LEGISLATION THAT IT DID DOESN'T

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.523
ADDRESS THAT. SPECIFIC PROBLEM-

00:35:58.589 --> 00:36:01.659
YOU KNOW JUST FOR TENANTS. WHO

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:03.094
ARE IN ARREARS BUT WHO DON'T

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.563
MEET THE 80% OR LOWER A MY

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.798
THRESHOLD. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:10.635
THE STRUCTURES OF THE FEDERAL

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:11.969
PROGRAM THAT IS CORRECT.

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:16.307
RICHARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:18.142
THANK YOU US SENATOR AND

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:20.845
SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:25.016
RICHARD- KIND OF PICKING UP ON

00:36:25.082 --> 00:36:26.951
THE ON THE QUESTIONS THAT- THE

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.753
CALL FROM FOURTEEN TO ASSESS

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:31.188
REGARDING THE KNOWN LEVEL THE

00:36:31.255 --> 00:36:33.357
NEED I THINK THE RESPONSE WAS

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:35.826
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE COULD NO-

00:36:35.893 --> 00:36:37.562
AND I'LL STIPULATE FOR PURPOSES

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:40.131
OF. THE QUESTION COMMON WANT TO

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:41.933
MAKE THAT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:43.701
NO IN EXACT TERMS RIGHT DOWN TO

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:47.371
THE PENNY. BUT I HAVING SPENT A

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:49.307
NUMBER OF YEARS. IN A ROW

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:51.709
HOUSING BUSINESS AS A PRIVATE

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:52.209
SECTOR INDIVIDUAL BEFORE

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:54.779
INVOLVED. IN FULL TIME ELECTIVE

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:56.714
OFFICE AT THE AGE OF FORTY FIVE

00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:59.784
YEARS OLD SOME YEARS AGO- I

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.786
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:02.286
LANDLORD IN THE STATE OF

00:37:02.353 --> 00:37:04.589
CALIFORNIA. BUT AS WE SIT HERE

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:08.559
TODAY WHO DOES NOT KNOW- THE

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:09.093
NUMBER OF TENANTS WHO ARE

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.796
DELINQUENT. ON HIS HIS OR HER

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:18.202
pIT WITH THEIR INCOME WAS. AT

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:20.638
THE POINT THEY WERE APPROVED

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:23.774
FOR RESIDENCY AND THAT- IN THAT

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:26.544
HOUSEHOLD. IN THAT TENDENCY. SO

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:28.012
WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:31.949
IS WHY. WE ARE REQUIRING IN THE

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:34.085
LEGISLATION A PRE APPLICATION

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:36.287
PROCESS THAT IT WOULD OCCUR UP

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:37.922
AND DOWN THE STATE. QUICKLY

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.658
OBVIOUSLY- THAT WOULD GIVE US

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:44.028
AN INVENTORY OR PRE ASSESSMENT.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:47.765
OF THE ANTICIPATED APPLE CAN

00:37:47.832 --> 00:37:49.767
AMOUNT FROM EACH ONE LANDLORDS

00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:52.370

WANT GIVEN THE SPECIFICS OF

00:37:58.275 --> 00:38:00.978
THAT- POKING OVER THE PAST FEW

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:03.981
DAYS SINCE THE PROPOSAL- YOU

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:06.384

THE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE TO

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:23.968
HAVE THAT INFORMATION WHY WE'RE

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.202

00:38:25.269 --> 00:38:28.539
TIME SO WE KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:30.541
THESE DISPARATE NUMBERS. WHICH

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:33.911
SEEM TO RANGE FROM. ANYWHERE

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.680

IMPLEMENTING- IN THEIR- AND THE

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.688
IT WOULD BE IN A THE THOSE WITH

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:22.425
PRIOR SYSTEM AROUND- SO THAT

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:25.294
WOULD BE THAT WE BE THAT THE

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:30.199
TEST OF HOW PIECE WAS ADMIN-

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:32.268

DIRECT I'M FUNDS THE PROBE. AS

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:49.118
AS THE- AS THE APPLICATIONS

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.486
COME AND THEY WOULD BE PAIRED

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.622
AGAINST THAT LOCATION- AND

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.690
THERE WOULD BE THAT THAT. ONE

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:55.925
OF THE GOALS OR IN EQUITY THERE

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:58.094
MAKING SURE THAT THOSE- THOSE

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.729
RESERVATIONS POOLS ARE FILLED

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:01.464
AND THAT THE- THE FUNDS GO TO

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.733
THOSE JURISDICTIONS- WE WOULD

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:05.034
SUSPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE IN

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.369
MANY CASES OVER SUBSCRIPTION

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:07.203
WHICH IS WHERE THAN THE

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.771
PRIORITIZATION OF BETWEEN

THINGS THAT WAS MENTIONED

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.144
EARLIER THAT I THINK IS THIS

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:17.013
WORTH INR FROM REPEATING AGAIN

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:19.548
IS. IS THIS CONCEPT THAT- AT

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:21.150
CERTAIN POINTS IN THE PROCESS

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:23.152
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABLE

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:25.154
TO. HOLD BACK FUNDS THAT BEEN

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.123
OBLIGATED. AND SO WE'VE

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.724
STRUCTURED- THIS PROGRAM TO

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:30.760
HELP WITH SIMILAR- JUST HAVE A

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:31.927
SIMILAR STRUCTURE AT THE STATE

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:33.396
LEVEL. WHERE FROM THE BLOCK

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:35.197
GRANTED FUNDING IF FUNDING IS

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:36.966
NOT OBLIGATED IT COULD BE HOLD

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:38.734
BACK INTO THE STATE CENTER AND

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.369
THEN REALLOCATING BASED OFF OF

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.537
DEMAND INTO THOSE EXISTING

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:44.340
RESERVATION POOLS. AND THEN- IN

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:48.377
THE. IN THE SAME WAY THE THOSE

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:49.712
THAT ARE ALREADY. THIS SYSTEM

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.514
AT A CERTAIN POINT WE WOULD

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.249
LOOK ACROSS AND WE WOULD SHIFT

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:54.884
AROUND- WE WOULD SHIFT AROUND

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:55.818
RESOURCES BETWEEN THE

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.687
RESERVATION HOLES. TO ACCOUNT

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:59.655
FOR DEMAND AND SHE MADE SURE

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:00.956
THAT WE COULD ALSO SEND DOWN

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:02.491
THE STATE RESOURCES. AND PUT

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.427
OURSELVES IN A POSITION TO

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:05.461
RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:08.597
FUNDING. AND SO I GUESS JUST TO

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:09.999
CUT TO THE CHASE- I WANT TO

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.134
JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE 50% OF

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:14.170
THOSE THAT ARE UNDER 50% AND I

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:15.271
WILL BE PRIORITISED ACROSS THE

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:17.206
STATE. IRRESPECTIVE OF REGIONAL

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:18.541
DIFFERENCES IN WHO GETS WHAT

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:20.409
FUNDING IS THAT IS THAT THE

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:20.976
SHORT VERSION OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:25.147
SAYING. NOT COULD NOT QUITE- SO

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:27.550
IS STILL WE STILL ARE. WE STILL

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:28.984
HAVE THESE RESERVATIONS TO

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:30.486
ENSURE. THAT THE FUNDS ARE

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:31.754
GETTING DISTRIBUTION JUST

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.255
DISPERSED ON A GEOGRAPHIC

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.291
BASIS. AND SO THAT WOULD BE.

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:36.826
INTEL YOU GET TO THAT POINT

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:37.993
WHERE IN TIME WHERE I THINK I'D

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.061

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:44.500
BE MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE BETWEEN

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:46.268
THE RESERVATION CALLS- IT WOULD

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.636
JUST BE PRIORITIZATION WITHIN

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:49.638
THE RESERVATION. HOWEVER AT

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.407
THAT TIME WHEN THEY WOULD BE

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:53.175
THE REDISTRIBUTION. CERTAINLY

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.611
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAD- HIGHER

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.179

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:12.481
THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER- SO FOR

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:13.749
JIM TO BE ABLE TO AVOID

DUPLICATION OF BENEFITS- HELP

ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:22.825
APPLICATION PORTAL AND THE

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:24.460
DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS SO THAT

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.161
THE PHYSICAL TRANSFER OF MONEY

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:27.596
WHAT HAPPENED BY THE CENTRAL

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.498
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER. THE

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:31.066
COMPONENT THAT WOULD BE-

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:32.701
HUNTING HELPS AND MANAGED

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:36.472

APPLY INTO THAT CENTRAL PORTAL

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:42.444
IN ENERGY IN YOUR DEFINITION OF

VENDOR RIGHT IT'S GONNA MAKE

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:50.719
SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING THE

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:51.954
SAME THING IS THAT CORRECT.

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:54.456
THAT THAT'S CORRECT. AND I'M

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.192
REALIZING I MIGHT WANNA MAKE

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:57.960
ONE MORE CLARIFICATION SURE IS

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:00.696
THAT IF IN A JURISDICTION-

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:02.331
OFFICE FOR BLOCK GRANTS AND

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:03.732
THEN THEY WOULD BE THE ONES WHO

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:05.367
WERE. DISTRIBUTING THAT THE

01:10:05.434 --> 01:10:07.970
FUNDS SAID THE STATEMENT I JUST

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.338
MADE IS ONLY FOR THOSE OPT INTO

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:10.806
THE STATE PROGRAM CORRECT IF A

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.341
JURISDICTION TAKE CHOOSES A

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.410
BLOCK GRANTS THAN THEY WOULD BE

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:15.144
THE ONES WHO WOULD BE

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.412
ADMINISTERING THAT THE- THAT.

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:17.780
THE FUNDS LOCALLY HOW TO

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.148
PERSONALLY APPRECIATED SO THAT

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:20.482
THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD SEGUE

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:22.184
TO MY LAST QUESTION. SO FOR

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:23.319
COUNTIES THAT ARE- IN A

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.888
POPULATION OF 200-100-0400

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:26.989
NINETY NINE THOUSAND. THEY

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.757
ACTUALLY HAVE TO ASK EACH CD

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:30.025
ESSENTIALLY TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:31.827
PERMISSION TO BE ABLE TO MOVE

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.063
FORWARD WITH THEIR- STRATEGY ON

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.698
THE BLOCK GRANTS. EVEN THOUGH

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:38.067
THIS JURISDICTION. OF ALREADY

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:43.539
BEEN ALLOCATED. DIRECT. DOLLARS

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.139
SIGNING GIVING EXAMPLE.

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:45.307
CINNAMON CAN. WILL RECEIVE FOR

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:48.143
MAY INJURY ALLOCATION. IF THEY

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:51.347
WANT TO BE ABLE TO RUN- THE

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.048
BLOCK GRANT PORTION OF THIS

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.750
FUNDING THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.852
TO GET THE BLESSING OF EIGHT CD

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.921
ON THE STRATEGIEN FORMULA. BUT

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.155
ANY COUNTIES FIVE HUNDRED

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:03.826
THOUSAND ENOUGH. DON'T SO THEY

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:06.528
CAN ADVANCE THEIR OWN STRATEGY

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:08.130
WITH THEIR BLOCK GRANT

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.332
ALLOCATION SO I JUST WANT TO

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:11.333
GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.403
WHY THOSE COUNTIES TWO HUNDRED

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.372
THOUSAND THE FOUR NINETY NINE

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:16.872
THOUSAND HAVE TO GET THE

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.540
BLESSING FROM A CD WHY CAN'T WE

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.509
JUST SAY ANYONE TWO HUNDRED

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:22.478
THOUSAND AND UP. AS WE'RE DOING

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:25.180
IT CARRIES A FIVE HUNDRED

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:25.781
THOUSAND OR NOT CAN RUN THEIR

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:28.417
OWN PROGRAM. YEAH I'LL START

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:30.085
WITH THAT QUESTION AND HANDED

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:32.254
OVER TO A NEW WITH THE DETAILS.

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:34.590
AS I STATED EARLIER- PREVIOUS

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:36.625
ROUNDS AND CARROTS FUNDING DID

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:40.195
GO DOWN TO A STATE- THREE LOCAL

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:42.164
COUNTIES AND CITIES- BUT THOSE

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:45.000
WERE WITH POPULATIONS OF FIVE

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:45.934
HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE SO

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:46.535
THERE IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.737
THEY HAVE- TAKING THOSE FUNDS

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.406
AND HAVE HAD. SOME TIME TO

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.141
ALLOCATE THROUGH THEIR LOCAL

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:54.810
RENTAL. ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS-

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.011
THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:58.113
INSURANCE WITH THOSE ENTITIES

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.382
THAT ARE SMALLER- AND SO THERE

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.718
IS THERE SOMETHING BUILT INTO-

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:05.287
PROVIDE. VERIFICATION ON THAT

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:07.189
BUT- IF I I'LL I'LL TURN IT

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:10.626
OVER. TO AMY FOR SOME DETAILS

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:12.261
THANK YOU. SURE GOOD AFTERNOON

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:15.798
SENATOR HELLO THERE- SO YES IS

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:18.200
ERICA WAS DESCRIBING- THINKING

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:19.835
OR THE INTENTION BEHIND THAT

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:23.072
WAS SIMPLY THAT- THE-

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:25.908
JURISDICTIONS IN THAT TWO

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:26.475
HUNDRED TO FOUR NINETY NINE

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:30.179
YEAH- SIZE- HAD NOT RECEIVED

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:32.848
PRIOR DOLLARS CRF FUNDING AND

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.850
SO THEY WERE UNLIKELY TO AND

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.719
YOU HAVE AN EXISTING PROGRAM-

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:38.454
AS ERICA WAS DESCRIBING SO WE

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.588
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY FELT

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:42.291
THEY HAD THE CAPACITY- TO

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:43.792
MANAGE THIS ESPECIALLY GIVEN

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.762
ALL THE OTHER ON DEMAND. BASED

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:47.963
ON LIKE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RIGHT

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.199
NOW WITH ENDEMIC- AND SO THAT'S

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:51.867
WHY THAT THERE IS FLEXIBILITY

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:54.603
BUILT IN- IF THEY WOULD LIKE

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:57.906
TO- AND- YOU KNOW IF THEY WOULD

01:12:57.973 --> 01:12:59.508
LIKE THE STATE TO ADMINISTER

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:00.909
BOTH THEIR DIRECT ALLOCATION

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:02.945
AND THEIR STATE SHARE- THAT'S

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:04.446
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE.

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.749
PROGRAM CAN DO FOR THEM- TO

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:08.684
RELIEVE THEM OF THAT BURDEN AND

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:10.719
ALL OF THAT- YOU KNOW THE

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:12.254
VERIFICATION- AND

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:13.355
ADMINISTRATIVE REPORTING

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:15.557
RESPONSIBILITIES- SO THAT'S ONE

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.092
OPTION- IF THEY'D LIKE TO DO

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:19.661
THE BLOCK GRANT- THEN THAT IS-

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:20.929
REQUESTING THAT THEY CAN

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:24.299
DEMONSTRATE SOME. CAPACITY OR-

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:25.734
YOU KNOW APPROACHED FOR HOW

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:28.237
THEY INTEND TO DO THAT BASED ON

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:29.905
THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:30.806
A PROGRAM IF THEY HAD A PROGRAM

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:33.208
THAT WOULD BE. A GREAT WAY OF

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:35.744
ESTABLISHING AT. ARMS IT IS SO

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:36.678
IT AND THEN THE OTHER THING I

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:37.980
WANTED TO JUST CLEAR MY CREE

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.481
THAT EVEN WITH THAT THE LARGE

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:40.649
JURISDICTIONS THERE ARE

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:41.884
EXPECTATIONS PLACED ON HOW

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:43.819
THOSE BLOCK GRANTS ARE. ARE

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:47.089
USED AND- AND SO THERE IS A

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:49.691
SIMILAR SET OF. EXPECTATIONS

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.760
AND RECORDING- AND ALL THE SAME

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:59.067
PARAMETERS APPLY FOR THE. TWO

01:13:59.134 --> 01:13:59.668

THIS ANALYSIS AND THEN JUST

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.508
DIGGING INTO THE DETAILS IT

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:07.442
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S TWO

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:09.845
DIFFERENT PARAMETERS BUT- BUT

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:11.547
YOU SEE THE SAME ANALYSIS

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.316
IMPRIMER SUPPLY REGARDLESS OF

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:16.051
THE CATEGORY OF TWO HUNDRED

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.020

EVENLY TO THE RULE AREAS OF THE

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:54.489
STATE. AND SO IF THEY DON'T IF

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:56.024

LEFT BEHIND IT SO I'M CONCERNED

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:02.331
THAT. THE SAME THING COULD

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.132
HAPPEN IN THESE AREAS WHERE THE

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:06.702

ABLE TO ACCESS THESE RESOURCES-

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:22.084
BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:23.585
BECAUSE WE DID SEE THAT IN THE-

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:26.788

CONTINUITY THOUGH FOR THOSE-

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:11.152
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:13.521
DURING- AND STRUGGLING THROUGH

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:17.425

FIRE THOSE MEMBERS WHO WANTED

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:28.770
TO ASK QUESTIONS. YES OKAY I

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:30.438
HAVE JUST A COUPLE BEFORE WE

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:32.774

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:37.945
PUBLIC MIGHT. PUBLIC COMMENT-

01:28:38.012 --> 01:28:42.817
SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS- THIS

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:45.520
THIS IS DEPENDENT ON A

01:28:45.586 --> 01:28:48.990
STATEWIDE ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:51.192
STATE PORTION OF THE FUNDS HAVE

01:28:51.259 --> 01:28:53.261
WE IDENTIFIED ALREADY WHO WILL

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:58.466
BE PERFORMING THIS FUNCTION. I

01:28:58.533 --> 01:29:00.702
BELIEVE- EITHER LYNN OR ANY

01:29:00.768 --> 01:29:03.071
CORRESPOND TO THAT IN DETAIL.

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:04.605
SENATOR WE HAVE CONDUCTED

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:06.908
EXTENSIVE MARKET RESEARCH- AND

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:09.277
HAD AN EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:12.547
WITH VENDORS- THAT TODAY HOUSES

01:29:12.613 --> 01:29:13.915
THE TECHNICAL KEEP ABOUT

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:15.116
CAPABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THE

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.351
WORK THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED- BUT

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:19.253
WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO A

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.189
CONTRACT- NO WILL WE INSTALL

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:24.425
THAT THE BILL IS AN ACTIVE.

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:26.260
RIGHT SIR BUT THE- THE EFFORT

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:27.528
IS ALREADY UNDERWAY TO FIND

01:29:27.595 --> 01:29:29.764
SOMEONE HAVE SOME AN ENTITY

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:32.100
THAT IS OR ENTITIES. CAPABLE OF

01:29:32.166 --> 01:29:35.103
A- OF HANDLING DESERVE FULL

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:37.538
FUNCTION OF THIS. YES SENATOR

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:41.542
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY- I THINK.

01:29:41.609 --> 01:29:43.077
THERE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:47.148
WERE RAISED. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S-

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.250
HOW I INTERPRET THESE IS THAT

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:55.623
WE ARE WE WANT. WE KNOW THAT

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.992
THERE ARE MANY TENANTS UNDER

01:29:58.059 --> 01:30:00.128
EXTREME ECONOMIC PRESSURE RIGHT

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:02.797
NOW WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE A

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:03.865
WAVE OF HOMELESSNESS WE KNOW

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:06.334
THAT MANY OF THEIR LANDLORDS

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.770
ARE ALSO UNDER EXTREME ECONOMIC

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:12.140
PRESSURE AND WE DO NOT WANT TO

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:14.275
A FURTHER BURDEN THEM OR TO

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:16.577
HAVE THEM MOTIVATED TO GET RID

01:30:16.644 --> 01:30:19.380
OF TENANTS BECAUSE- THAT IS NOT

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:20.848
THE KIND OF SITUATION WE WANT

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:22.016
TO BE IN RIGHT NOW WHEN WE

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:23.484
ALREADY HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:25.052
THAT WAS WELL UNDERWAY EVEN

01:30:25.119 --> 01:30:27.588
PRIOR TO COBIT. SO HOW ARE HERE

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:31.259
THIS IS THAT. AND OF COURSE WE-

01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:33.494
WILL SEE ALL OF WHAT'S GOING

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:36.430
ALL BIT IS THAT THERE IS- WITH

01:30:36.497 --> 01:30:37.665
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:38.866
BE A PARTNER WITH THE

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.635
ADMINISTRATION IN THIS AND THAT

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:42.670
WE WANT TO SEE IT SUCCEED. AND

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:43.738
THAT THE QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:47.241
ASKING OUR TO HELP ENSURE THAT

01:30:47.308 --> 01:30:49.577
WE SUCCEED AND WE SUCCEED

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:52.046
SMOOTHLY. AND SO THAT WE DON'T

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:53.881
ADD EITHER FURTHER HEADACHE ON

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:57.552
THE PART OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ON

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:58.820
SAID I THINK THERE'S AN

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:01.455
APPRECIATION THAT EVERYTHING WE

01:31:01.522 --> 01:31:03.291
HAVE UNDERTAKEN IN THIS

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:06.427
PANDEMIC HAS BEEN COMPLICATED.

01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:10.498
DIFFICULT HI THERE ARE STRESSES

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:13.968
UNDER SO MANY BUSINESS SECTORS

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:15.536
INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES THE

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:17.405
GOVERNMENT ITSELF DUE TO THIS

01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:21.309
PANDEMIC. THAT NOTHING IS EASY

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:24.245
BUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN. DESIGN

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.981
THE SYSTEMS SO THAT THEY ARE

01:31:27.048 --> 01:31:29.684
WORKING. I'LL USE JUST AGAIN

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:32.787
THAT SIMPLY EFFICIENTLY AND OF

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:35.623
COURSES FRAUD PROOF AS POSSIBLE.

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:37.225
AND AS MUCH AS WE CAN USE

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.527
EXISTING STRUCTURES ALL THE

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:42.163
BETTER AND I THINK MANY OF US.

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.831
LIVE IN REGIONS WHERE THERE ARE

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:47.034
EXISTING FERRY FUNCTIONAL AND

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:49.003
ROBUST EMERGENCY RENTAL

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:52.073
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. AND WE

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:53.674
KNOW THAT THE FUNDING THAT'S

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:55.877
GOING DIRECTLY TO THE LARGE

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:58.246
CITIES THAT NEW LIKELY IN LARGE

01:31:58.312 --> 01:32:00.181
COUNTIES THEY'LL LIKELY USE

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:01.148
THEIR EXISTING PROGRAM IF THEY

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:03.551
HAVE ONE BUT IT WOULD BE WISE

01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:06.554
FOR THE STATE TO ALSO LOOK AT

01:32:06.621 --> 01:32:08.022
THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:12.393
ARE OPERATING RIGHT NOW AND

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:13.361
A PARTNER WITH THEM

01:32:13.427 --> 01:32:15.162
APPROPRIATELY TO ASSIST US IN

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:18.532
THIS TASK- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:20.334
I HAVE IS THAT WHILE I THINK

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:22.937
THIS IS WELL DESIGNED. TO

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:25.473
MOTIVATE LANDLORDS TO

01:32:25.539 --> 01:32:28.309
PARTICIPATE WHICH IS OF COURSE

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:29.844
WE WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON.

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:31.379
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE ALREADY

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:33.814
MORE ALL RIGHT ALWAYS MARKET

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:37.318
FORCES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:39.820
MOTIVATE A LANDLORD NOT TO. AND

01:32:39.887 --> 01:32:42.290
IN THOSE AREAS THOSE REGIONS

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:44.358
THAT HAVE FOR EXAMPLE VERY

01:32:44.425 --> 01:32:46.727
STRONG RENT CONTROLS AND IF

01:32:46.794 --> 01:32:47.962
THERE ARE LANDLORDS WHO'VE

01:32:48.029 --> 01:32:50.197
BEEN. ALL JUST- YOU KNOW I'VE

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:53.100
BEEN WANTING TO. RID THEMSELVES

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:55.770
OF TEN X. OR Y. FOR SOME TIME

01:32:55.836 --> 01:32:57.405
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT UNDER

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.607
THE STATE'S VACANCY DE CONTROL

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:02.376
LAWS THAT THE- THE RENT THAT

01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:03.878
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET WITH

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:05.613
THE NEW TENANT MIGHT BE A GOOD

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:08.482
DEAL HIGHER. I THINK THAT WE

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:10.518
WANT TO MAKESURE AS WE MOVE

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:13.020
FORWARD WE WANT TO MONITOR THIS

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:13.888
BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:16.991
CREATE. THAT CONTEXT WHERE

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:18.926
BECAUSE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:21.062
THAT THERE'S SOME NUMBER THAT

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:22.863
DON'T PARTICIPATE AND THUS WE

01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:26.067
FACE ANOTHER INFLUX OF EVICTION

01:33:26.133 --> 01:33:29.403
ACTIONS THAT REALLY PUT US IN.

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:32.306
IT AS WE KNOW IT IS SO MUCH

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:34.642
HARDER TO DEAL WITH A HOUSING

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:36.444
SITUATION AFTER SOMEONE IS

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:38.379
INFECTED SO IF WE CAN KEEP

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:40.948
PEOPLE HOUSE THAT HAS GOT TO BE

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:43.751
OUR OBJECTIVE- SO WITH THAT I

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:48.289
FEEL LIKE. THIS IS- WE'VE GOT A

01:33:48.356 --> 01:33:50.191
GOOD INITIAL STRUCTURE THERE

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:51.659
ARE PROBABLY SOME THINGS THAT

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:53.794
COULD YOU KNOW COULD BE TWEAKED

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:56.497
AND WE HAVE SOME TIME BEFORE

01:33:56.564 --> 01:33:58.265
BETWEEN NOW AND ONE INDEX AND I

01:33:58.332 --> 01:33:59.233
DON'T EAN BETWEEN WHEN IT

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.701
EXPIRES OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA

01:34:00.768 --> 01:34:02.737
BE MONITORING THIS BUT WHERE WE

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:04.972
MAY SEE A NECESSITY TO TWEAK.

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.340
AND I WOULD ALSO JUST REYES

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:09.577
QUICKLY THAT FROM WHAT I AM

01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:12.013
VERY GLAD TO THE BILL WASN'T

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:14.281
PRINT AS OF YESTERDAY AND THAT

01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:16.283
WE HAVE AN ANALYSIS AND THAT WE

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:17.518
WILL NOT BE VOTING ON THE FLOOR

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:19.787
UNTIL THURSDAY HOWEVER WE ALSO

01:34:19.854 --> 01:34:21.956
KNOW THAT YOU KNOW EVEN IN MY

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:23.991
BEST BILLS THAT WENT THROUGH

01:34:24.058 --> 01:34:25.760
EVERY COMEDIAN EVERY PROCESS

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.795
THAT WE FOUND IN CHAPTER RING

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:29.397
FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE HAD SOME

01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:31.365
TECHNICAL FIXES TO MAKE. SO

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:33.300
THERE MAY BE AND LIKELY WILL BE

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:35.236
SOME TECHNICAL FIXES ARE

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:37.271
DRAFTING ERRORS BUT WE WILL

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:39.940
HAVE TIME TO ADDRESS THOSE AS

01:34:40.007 --> 01:34:45.079
WE REALIZE THEM AND- AND NOT

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:47.748
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. NOT ACTING

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:49.817
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A DEADLINE

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:52.086
FOR OUR EXISTING MORATORIUM. SO

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:53.854
WITH THAT LET'S GO TO THE

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.489
PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL FIRST

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:57.024

WAS SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:45.672
FIRST STEP IN PROVIDING

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:47.907
STABILITY FOR RENTERS- AS WE

01:55:47.974 --> 01:55:49.676
KNOW WALL INITIAL CARES ACT

OPPONENTS PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:52.412
MANY HOUSEHOLDS AND PEOPLE WERE

ABLE TO STAY CURRENT ON THE

ARE BEHIND. THE BUILDING

01:55:58.918 --> 01:56:00.186
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP BUT IT'S

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.587
CERTAINLY NOT SUFFICIENT TO

01:56:01.654 --> 01:56:02.822
DEAL WITH THIS AGREEMENT THE

01:56:02.889 --> 01:56:05.391
LIABILITY- TARGETING ASSISTANCE

01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:06.726

EXTREMELY LOW INCOME

01:56:12.365 --> 01:56:13.766
INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS BUT

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:15.501
IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT BECAUSE

01:56:15.568 --> 01:56:16.836
IT'S HARD TO SAY WHETHER A

01:56:16.903 --> 01:56:18.204
PARTICULAR HOUSEHOLD MIGHT BE

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:20.139
MOST AT RISK OF BEING AFFECTED

01:56:20.206 --> 01:56:22.041
OR FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS-

01:56:22.108 --> 01:56:23.776
IN PARTICULAR IF THIS BILL

01:56:23.843 --> 01:56:25.378
COULD TARGET COMMUNITIES THAT

RENTAL ASSISTANCE FROM THIS

01:56:44.297 --> 01:56:45.832

DOWN- ALL RIGHT SO ON. FIVE I

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:20.653
WANTED TO RAISE ONE ISSUE THAT

02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:22.288
I THINK IS WORTH CONSIDERING IT

02:04:22.354 --> 02:04:24.023
ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO

02:04:24.089 --> 02:04:25.558
ALTER IN TERMS OF OUR ADOPTION

02:04:25.624 --> 02:04:27.693
OF THE BILL TODAY BUT I THOUGHT

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:30.663
SENATOR CORTESE'S OF A QUESTION

02:04:30.729 --> 02:04:32.631
OR SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO GET

02:04:32.698 --> 02:04:34.366
EITHER WAY ABOUT A CALL CENTER

02:04:34.433 --> 02:04:37.002
HAD SOME MERIT AND I NOTE THAT

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:39.338
THE UNTIL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT

02:04:39.405 --> 02:04:41.574
THERE IS THE EXPECTATION THAT

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.543
THERE WOULD BE. A WEBSITE THAT

02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:45.878
WAS AVAILABLE FOR THE

02:04:45.945 --> 02:04:49.148
APPLICATIONS- YOU KNOW TWENTY

02:04:49.215 --> 02:04:51.483
FOUR HOURS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK

02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:53.819
AND OF COURSE- YOU KNOW ANYTIME

02:04:53.886 --> 02:04:55.487
YOU SET UP A NEW SYSTEM LIKE

02:04:55.554 --> 02:04:57.256
THAT THEY KEEP AND- WE'VE SEEN

02:04:57.323 --> 02:04:59.091
IT BEFORE THEY CAN RUN INTO

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:02.194
PROBLEMS SO. OF COURSE- WE MAY

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:04.029
EXPERIENCE SOME OF THAT. AND

02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:05.998
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO

02:05:06.065 --> 02:05:08.701
KNOW THAT INTERNET ACCESS IS

02:05:08.767 --> 02:05:10.769
STILL A CHALLENGE FOR SOME OF

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.104
THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT MOST NEED

02:05:12.171 --> 02:05:13.706
THIS ASSISTANCE. AND

02:05:13.772 --> 02:05:16.542

KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO GO AND

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:22.514
SUCH AND SO TO IT I THINK IT

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:25.651
IS. WORTHWHILE FOR THE

02:05:25.718 --> 02:05:28.621
ADMINISTRATION IN. ROLLING THIS

02:05:28.687 --> 02:05:30.489

WHETHER SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR

02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:36.195

02:08:54.359 --> 02:08:56.128
CONSTITUENTS THAT- THEY

02:08:56.195 --> 02:08:57.463
APPRECIATE TO TWENTY FIVE

02:08:57.529 --> 02:08:59.798
PERCENT. BUT SOME OTHER TENANTS

02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:02.267
ARE JUST STARTING OUT AND NOT

02:09:02.334 --> 02:09:03.936
MAKING ANY GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO

02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:07.005
MAKE THE 25% AND ALLOW IT TO.

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:09.608
FOLLOW UP IN ARREARS AND AT THE

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:10.676
SAME TIME THEY'RE GOING OUT

02:09:10.742 --> 02:09:12.811
BUYING NEW CARS AND OTHER.

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:13.946
ITEMS THAT THEY SEE ON A

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:16.014
REGULAR BASIS SO I JUST WISH WE

02:09:16.081 --> 02:09:17.749
COULD KIND OF LIKE. A LITTLE

02:09:17.816 --> 02:09:19.084
MORE TEETH AND MAKING SURE THAT

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:21.353
A FOOT. TENET IS ABLE TO PAY

02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:24.423
THE 25% THEY DO SO WITHOUT LED

02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:28.627
IT ACCRUE AS MANY OF THEM SAY

02:09:28.694 --> 02:09:31.063
IT'S HAPPENING. THERE'S ALSO- A

02:09:31.130 --> 02:09:32.798
LONG HISTORY OF PEOPLE OF COLOR

02:09:32.865 --> 02:09:33.899
USING RENTAL PROPERTIES AS

02:09:33.966 --> 02:09:35.767
INVESTMENTS. AFTER BEING DENIED

02:09:35.834 --> 02:09:37.769
OR DISCOURAGE FROM OTHER TYPES

02:09:37.836 --> 02:09:39.771
OF- INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

02:09:39.838 --> 02:09:41.440
SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THIS

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:43.175
AGREEMENT BECAUSE THIS

02:09:43.242 --> 02:09:45.210
RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR.

02:09:45.277 --> 02:09:47.446
TENANTS AS WELL AS LANDLORDS TO

02:09:47.513 --> 02:09:50.883
BE COVERED. IT IS NOT AN END

02:09:50.949 --> 02:09:52.784
ALL BE ALL LIKE YOU SAY IT'S

02:09:52.851 --> 02:09:54.286
NOT THE PERFECT WORLD BUT IT

02:09:54.353 --> 02:09:56.855
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN ORDER

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:58.690
TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU ARE USING

02:09:58.757 --> 02:10:01.160
JUST- ALLELES INVESTMENT A RANT

02:10:01.226 --> 02:10:04.463
GET. THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

02:10:04.530 --> 02:10:06.899
IS STILL A HEAVY BURDEN THAT

02:10:06.965 --> 02:10:09.101
LANDLORDS ARE CARING TO HELP

02:10:09.168 --> 02:10:09.968
THE STATE OUT AT THIS CRITICAL

02:10:10.035 --> 02:10:12.604
TIME SPECIFICALLY SMALL

02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:14.439
LANDLORDS DESERVE THIS RELIEF.

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:16.942
THAT'S WHY TODAY'S ACTIONS IS

02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:19.144
SO IMPORTANT. THE NEW RENTAL

02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:19.878

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:21.613
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED RENT

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:22.614
ARREARS AMONG THE MOST

02:10:22.681 --> 02:10:26.818
VULNERABLE. AND THE 20% CUT

02:10:26.885 --> 02:10:28.854
THERE WERE ASKING SMALL.

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:31.390
LANDLORDS TO TAKE IS NECESSARY

02:10:31.456 --> 02:10:33.192
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT

02:10:33.258 --> 02:10:34.259

OF THE- I'M TALK. WITH THAT SO

02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:46.091
TO ME THIS BILL FRAMES THE

02:12:46.158 --> 02:12:47.726
LANDLORDS TO ACTUALLY HAVING A

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:48.994
CHOICE BETWEEN WHETHER TO

02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:50.696
PARTICIPATE IN THE RENTAL

02:12:50.762 --> 02:12:53.131
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. BUT I GOT

02:12:53.198 --> 02:12:54.232
YOU GOT ASK YOURSELF IS IT

02:12:54.299 --> 02:12:55.400
REALLY CHOICE BECAUSE EITHER

02:12:55.467 --> 02:12:57.502
WAY. THE FORCE TO FORGIVE A

02:12:57.569 --> 02:12:58.870
SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RENT

02:12:58.937 --> 02:12:59.971
OWED THEY CAN EITHER

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:01.039
PARTICIPATE IN THE RENTAL

02:13:01.106 --> 02:13:03.108
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND GET A

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:05.243
MAXIMUM 80% OF THE RENTAL

02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:06.411
ARREARS AND HAVE TO FORGIVE THE

02:13:06.478 --> 02:13:08.180
REST. OR THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO

02:13:08.246 --> 02:13:10.182
PARTICIPATE. IN WHICH CASE YOU

02:13:10.248 --> 02:13:12.017
GET ONLY 25% ARE STILL

02:13:12.084 --> 02:13:13.719
EFFECTIVELY FORCED TO FORGET AT

02:13:13.785 --> 02:13:15.454
LEAST SOME PORTION OF THE REST-

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:16.488
BECAUSE THEY ARE BARRED FROM

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:18.323
RECOVERING DAMAGES IN COURT.

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:20.125
WHEN THEY DIDN'T COOPERATE IN

02:13:20.192 --> 02:13:22.260
SEEKING RENTAL ASSISTANCE SO. I

02:13:22.327 --> 02:13:24.596
KNOW IT'S A CHALLENGE- I DIED I

02:13:24.663 --> 02:13:25.964
DON'T THINK THEY REALLY HAVE A

02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:27.032
CHOICE IN THE END IF WE'RE

02:13:27.099 --> 02:13:28.400
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD I THINK

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:29.968
YOU NEED TO BE FULLY FUNDED.

02:13:30.035 --> 02:13:31.803
AND THEN THE FINAL THING- AND I

02:13:31.870 --> 02:13:32.637
DON'T THINK WE HAVE DEPARTMENT

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:34.773
FINANCE HERE ANYMORE. BUT AFTER

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.775
TODAY'S DEVASTATING AUDIT FROM

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:38.377
THE STATE AUDITOR. AS IT

02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:42.047
RELATES. TO A FRAUD IN E. D. D.

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:42.614
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:13:42.681 --> 02:13:44.483
THERE'S A WAY. THAT THIS RENTAL

02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:46.585
RATE RELIEF PAYMENT GOES ONLY

02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:48.754
TO LANDLORDS. WHO HAVE DECLARED

02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:49.688
RENTAL INCOME WHEN THEY FILE

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:51.556
THEIR TAX DOCUMENTS SO WE CAN

02:13:51.623 --> 02:13:52.791
AVOID THE TYPE OF FRAUD THAT

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:55.627
WE'VE SEEN A- DVD. SO WITH

02:13:55.694 --> 02:13:57.696

SUPPORT- BUT WITH THE QUESTION.

02:14:20.318 --> 02:14:23.555
THE ROLL OUT OF THESE MATTERS

02:14:23.622 --> 02:14:24.856
HILDA FOR HAS LARGELY BEEN

02:14:24.923 --> 02:14:29.761
CLUMSY. THE FIRST OF THIS WEEK

02:14:29.828 --> 02:14:32.931
ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE ABOUT EX

02:14:32.998 --> 02:14:34.966
EXPEDITING THE VACCINE.

02:14:35.033 --> 02:14:38.770
DISSEMINATION AND IT WAS WHAT

02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:40.338
PUT PICKED MY INTEREST WAS YOUR

02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:43.108
MENTION OF A WEBSITE APPLICABLE

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:46.311

02:14:47.813 --> 02:14:49.080
APPLICABLE TO THE VACCINE

02:14:49.147 --> 02:14:53.051
DISTRIBUTION. HOWEVER AFTER ITS

02:14:53.118 --> 02:14:56.054
ANNOUNCEMENT THEN I FOUND OUT

02:14:56.121 --> 02:14:58.857
FROM OTHER SOURCES. THE ONLY

02:14:58.924 --> 02:15:00.492
ONE COUNTY WAS GOING TO BE

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:03.428
ACCESSING THAT WEBSITE THE

02:15:03.495 --> 02:15:05.997
MEDIA ONLY ONE COUNT OF FIFTY

02:15:06.064 --> 02:15:09.568
EIGHT. AND THE OTHER FIFTY

02:15:09.634 --> 02:15:10.602
EIGHT LIKELY WOULD TAKE UP TO

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:13.472
SIX WEEKS. TO HAVE THAT AVAILED

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:16.975
OF THEM. MY POINT IS A LOT OF

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:19.277
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE

02:15:19.344 --> 02:15:21.012
IN THIS EMERGENCY SITUATION AND

02:15:21.079 --> 02:15:22.581

REPRESENT ARE AT BEST CONFUSED.

02:15:31.957 --> 02:15:33.325
I THINK THAT MORE PLANNING HAS

02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:36.428
TO GO IN TO THE CRAFTING OF

02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:38.296
THIS LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS

THESE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS IT'S

02:15:40.232 --> 02:15:42.200
QUITE CLEAR THAT THIS ONE

02:15:42.267 --> 02:15:44.369

NEED TO SLOW DOWN THE TRAIN AND

02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:54.346
BE MORE. CLEAR MORE DEFINITIVE

02:15:54.412 --> 02:15:56.348
AND DISSEMINATED MORE WIDELY

02:15:56.414 --> 02:15:57.849
AND MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE IF

02:15:57.916 --> 02:15:58.984
