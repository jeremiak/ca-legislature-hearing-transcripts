IS WHAT BROUGHT ME TO MY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD. TWENTY NINE YEARS AGO- IT'S WHY I FELL IN LOVE WITH SAN FRANCISCO WITH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH OUR STATE. AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT I'M HONORED TO REPRESENT- REPRESENT SOME OF THE VERY TOP DESTINATIONS NOT JUST IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST SOME OF THE BEST PLACES TO VISIT- CLEARLY DURING THIS TIME PERIOD A PANDEMIC IN RECESSION. THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN UTTERLY DECIMATED AND- I'M HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO HEAR EVERY IDEA. THAT IS OUT THERE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP MOVE THINGS FORWARD. LET ME ALSO SAY THIS WHICH IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T THINK THAT THE STATE. HAS PLAYED ENOUGH OF A ROLE IN WORKING WITH TOURISM TO MOVE FARTHER INDUSTRY AND I KNOW THAT ARCHER WOMAN. AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WE'RE VERY COMMITTED. TO REALLY REVITALIZING THIS CONVERSATION AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO BE CREATIVE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE.

I AND YOU CAN CONSIDER ME A CHEERLEADER FOR CALIFORNIA LITERALLY I WAS ACTUALLY A CHEERLEADER IN JUNIOR HIGH. BUT BUT IN REALITY WE NEED A CHEERLEADER FOR OUR STATE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE INDUSTRIES YOU REPRESENT ARE NOT ONLY HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S GONNA STAND UP. AND FIGHT FOR THEM BUT THAT'S GOING TO CHEER YOU ON BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO GET DOORS OPEN. SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD ITH EIGHT OVERVIEW FROM CALIFORNIA TOURISM MARKETING PROGRAM AND WE WILL INVITE CAROLINE. BUT TED UP WHO IS THE PRESIDENT. AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF EXECUTOR OFFICER OF VISIT CALIFORNIA. WE COULD START PLAYING MUSIC LIKE. I'M SITTING HERE ABOUT HERE.

BEING PART OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT MEETING AND- THIS IS MY FIRST- IN PERSON APPEARANCE FORMALLY SINCE MARCH SO- I'VE DONE AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED ZOOM SPEECHES CALLS INFO ALL DAY LONG ON ZOOM SO- I I'M JUST SO PLEASED TO BE HERE IN PERSON SO THANK YOU FOR BEING BRAVE AND TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS- WITH THEIR GREAT COMMITTEE CONSULTING THEIR DATA MITCHELL- SO ANYWAY THANKS- AND TODAY I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF TOURISM FOR FREE ALL OF YOU IN THOSE LISTENING AND- AND REALLY WHAT'S BEEN LOST DUE TO COVE IT. AND HOW WE AT THIS CALIFORNIA ARE PIVOTING ON BEHALF OF THE INDUSTRY AND SOME TRENDS SO FOR THOSE THAT ARE A LITTLE LESS FAMILIAR WITH VISIT CALIFORNIA I JUST WANT TO START HERE WE'RE ACTUALLY THE FIRST NON AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY BOARD IN CALIFORNIA FRANKLY THE NATION I'M PROBABLY THE WORLD A FIVE A ONE C. SIX- WITH SOME ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND INVESTORS USED TO BE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND BUT- WE'VE SEEN SOME WANING OBVIOUSLY. AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM YET BUT IT WAS ESTABLISHED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO- AND THOSE INVESTORS ARE REALLY SIT AT THE TABLE AND HELP GUIDE US STRATEGICALLY YOU CAN SEE ON THE NEXT SLIDE THAT THE INVESTORS INCLUDE EVERYONE FROM RENTAL CRS TO HOTELS RESTAURANTS RETAIL OF A SKI OPERATIONS TRANSPORTATION- AND ATTRACTIONS OF COURSE AND THEN OTHER CATEGORIES THAT ARE VERY MUCH PART OF OUR- TRAVEL. ECOSYSTEM THESE BUSINESS AGREE TO PAY AN S. VOLUNTARILY AND THEY ACTUALLY HOLD A REFERENDUM EVERY SIX YEARS TO RENEW. THAT REFERENDUM WHICH JUST OCCURRED LAST YEAR. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT OUR BOARD LEADERSHIP I REALLY WORK WITH THEM ON A DAILY BASIS MANY ARE HERE TODAY ALSO TO TESTIFY BUT SOME OF THE GREATEST GLOBAL ICONS YOU CAN SEE. IN THE WORLD OF ENTERTAINMENT AND TOURISM ARE HELPING AND INVESTING IN EVERY DAY TO GUIDE THIS INCREDIBLE ECONOMIC ENGINE. FOR CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION TO OUR TRAVEL INDUSTRY PARTNERS WE ACTUALLY WORK IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH MANY STATE AGENCIES SO I JUST KIND OF THREW UP THIS ECOSYSTEM IF YOU WILL OF HOW WE WORK. AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE YOU KNOW TOURISM IMPACTS OUR PUBLIC POLICY. AND I ALSO SET ON THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S- INTER AGENCY INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL ON OF COURSE WORK CLOSELY. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND NOW YOU KNOW SO PLEASED TO HAVE YOUR LEADERSHIP AS PART OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL- BUT OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST ARE MISSION CRITICAL RESPONSIBILITY IS TO DRIVE DEMAND. AND TOP OF MIND AWARENESS- TO BRING CONSUMERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO CALIFORNIA- IN A VERY HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT SO. WE PUT THIS TOGETHER JUST KINDA INDICATE THAT WE SET VERY HIGH UP IN THE FINAL YOU KNOW IF CONSUMERS DON'T END UP IN THE FINAL IN THE END UP IN NEVADA'S FINAL OR FLORIDA'S FINAL. WE'VE LOST THEM SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET THAT TOP OF MIND AWARENESS- AND THEN WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY AS PEOPLE START TO CONSIDER CALIFORNIA NOT OTHER DESTINATIONS. BUT IT'S REALLY THE PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM TODAY THAT REPRESENT THAT GOLDEN TRIANGLE OR THE TRANSACTION WHEN OF THE VISITOR DOLLARS COME INTO THE STATE AND HAVE TO DELIVER ON OUR BRAND PROMISE THAT WE'RE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH ALL THOSE TWENTY THOUSAND PLUS BUSINESSES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW ACTUALLY THE VISIT CALIFORNIA WAS BORN OUT OF A CRISIS SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN TALKING ABOUT CRISIS. IN FACT IT HAPPENED OUT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE AS WELL AS THE NORTHRIDGE. EARTHQUAKE NOT ONLY DID IT SHATTER MUCH OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE- WE KNOW THAT HERE. FOR REAL I FELT IT MYSELF IN SACRAMENTO NOW I'M AGING MYSELF. IN THE BAY AREA BUT- IT IT SHATTERED THE IMAGE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD- AND IT WAS A MEDIA. CHALLENGED THE THAT THE INDUSTRY COULD NOT REALLY- RESPOND TO ALLOW WE HAD SOME REAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES THE MEDIA WAS REPORTING IT GLOBALLY AS IF ALL OF CALIFORNIA HAD IMPLODED- AND THAT WAS A WAKE UP CALL TO THE INDUSTRY THAT THEY REALLY NEEDED TO COME TOGETHER TO. WORK COLLABORATIVELY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE COMPETITORS ON A GLOBAL SCALE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO CRISIS AND NOW WE FIND OURSELVES IN A- DUAL CRISIS NOT ONLY COVE IT BUT OF COURSE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL YOU KNOW CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF WILDFIRES WHERE THE INDUSTRY HAS REALLY COME TOGETHER. AND WE WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY ON COMMUNICATIONS THE REALITY VERSUS THE MEDIA NARRATIVE THAT'S BEING SHOWN GLOBALLY- AND COMMUNICATING DIRECTLY WITH THE CONSUMER AS WELL. YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL WE'VE HAD TEN IT'S CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF RECORD GROWTH GENERATING JUST EVEN FROM VISIT CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS INCREMENTALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SPENDING INTO THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AND GENERATING ABOUT TWELVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE PRINCIPALLY FROM SALES TAX REVENUE AND TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX- AND VERY IMPORTANTLY GENERATING ONE POINT TWO MILLION JOBS DIRECTLY IN TERRORISM NOT JUST. NOT INDIRECTLY BUT DIRECTLY AS A MATTER OF FACT- IN OUR WORLD COUNTY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IT'S THEN WILL NUMBER ONE OR TWO EMPLOYER GIVEN THE WAYNE OF EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES IT IS MISSION CRITICAL FOR OUR RURAL AREAS- WERE MUCH OF OUR CRISIS HAS YOU KNOW- BEEN EXPERIENCE UP UNTIL THIS YEAR WITH COVERT- TO GET THESE PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. SO I'M JUST GOING TO TURN TO COVERT NOW AND PROVIDE AN UPDATE CERTAINLY CO THAT HAS NOT BEEN KIND TO THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AND WE FELT THE IMPACTS IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN SEE ON THE NEXT SLIDE THE PRECIPITOUS DECLINE FROM OUR TWENTY NINETEEN NUMBERS AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR. POINT NINE BILLION- DOWN TO ARE PROJECTED SIXTY SIX BILLION IN VISITOR SPEND- IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN NINE TIMES WORSE THAN NINE ELEVEN AND THAT IS A MILESTONE MARKER FOR ALL OF US IN THE INDUSTRY OF HOW EPIC CRISIS CAN GET AND YET. WE'RE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING THAT'S NINE TIMES GREATER. SO I YOU KNOW THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS I CAN REVEAL NOW THAT THE LATEST RESEARCH FROM OXFORD ECONOMICS SHOWS THE BAD SITUATION THAT PRESENTED ITSELF IN MAY. IS ACTUALLY GETTING WORSE- YOU CAN SEE HERE FROM OUR TRAVEL SPENDING FORECASTS FROM TOURISM ECONOMICS THAT WERE NOT DUE TO RECOVER. TO THOSE TWENTY NINETEEN NUMBERS AND FOR FIVE YEARS AND BASICALLY PUSHED US BACK AN ENTIRE DECADE. AND THIS IS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE AND THE DATA ANALYTICS THAT WAS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE VACCINE- AND ANOTHER ROUND OF FEDERAL STIMULUS THAT IS STILL UNDECIDED AT LEAST AS OF. TODAY JUST FOR CONTEXT PRIOR TO COVE IT OVER THE LAST DECADE LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY JOB GROWTH HAS FAR OUTPACED. OTHER SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA IT IS BEEN- BRIGHT SIDE AND VERY MUCH PART OF THE GROWTH OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. BUT WITH CODED- YOU CAN SEE IN THIS CHART THAT NEARLY FOUR IN TEN OF ALL JOBS LOST IN CALIFORNIA DURING THIS PERIOD I'VE BEEN IN HOSPITALITY. AND THE LEISURE SECTOR AS A MATTER OF FACT OUR CALCULUS WHEN WE WENT INTO THE MAY TIME PERIOD WAS THAT THE STATE WAS PROVIDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OF. VERY CONSERVATIVELY ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH- ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS A MONTH BECAUSE OF THIS. SUSTAIN JOB LOSS AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IT WAS CREATING PRIOR TO COPE WITH THESE NUMBERS DON'T EVEN I WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE LIVE RECENT LAKE. THAT DISNEY OR THE RECENT ROUND OF JOB REDUCTIONS AT THE AIRLINES- AND ALSO NUMEROUS BUSINESSES AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE HAVE SLID INTO BANKRUPTCY GONE OUT OF BUSINESS OR FRANKLY JUST HANGING ON BY A THREAD. THE PANDEMIC HASHIT CALIFORNIA'S TOURISM INDUSTRY HARDER THAN OTHER STATES PARTICULARLY IN OUR GATEWAY URBAN CENTERS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA WAS THE COUNTRY'S TOP TOURISM ECONOMY. IT'S NOW AMONG THE WORST PERFORMING ONLY FIVE STATES HAVE LOST MORE VISITOR SPENDING SINCE MARCH AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE ARE THE NUMBER ONE TRAVEL DESTINATION AND SO WHEN WE ARE HIT WE ARE HIT VERY HARD WE'RE ACTUALLY FIVE TIMES THE SIZE OF THE HAWAIIAN TOURISM ECONOMY AS A MATTER OF CONTEXT AND SCALE. OBVIOUSLY DISNEYLAND UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND OTHER ATTRACTIONS STILL AWAIT A GREEN LIGHT FOR SAFETY OPENING. AND THEN ADDITION HOTELS HOPING TO REGAIN SOME BUSINESS MEETINGS AT EVEN REDUCE CAPACITIES. AND THEY'VE DEVELOPED PROTOCOLS USED SUCCESSFULLY IN OTHER STATES YOU'LL HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM THE PANEL LATER. I JUST WANNA POINT OUT THE NEXT SLIDE IN TERMS OF THE MEETINGS MARKET WHICH IS CRITICAL. OUR RESEARCH ANALYTICS ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT TO BE ABOUT SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN SPENDING AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION THAT IS STILL YET TO OPEN- AND THE MEETINGS MARKET IS VERY FORWARD- PLANNING SO MEETINGS OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING AT TWO THREE FIVE YEAR CALENDARS. AND FOR SURE- THIS NEXT CALENDAR YEAR- THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS AT LEAST HAVE BEEN WIPED OFF THE CHART. BUT THAT'S SIXTY FIVE BILLION IT'S ACTUALLY JUST IT HASN'T EVAPORATED IS JUST MOVED TO OTHER STATES WHICH IS SO UNFORTUNATE. SO IN TERMS OF OUR PIVOT I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR TRAVEL MESSAGE JEAN PRIORITIES AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS BIG YELLOW CIRCLE SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT AND WE'RE LEADING WITH THE SAFETY MESSAGE- SECONDARILY DOUBLING DOWN ON ECONOMIC RCOVERY. AND I'M PEELING TO CALIFORNIANS TO CONSIDER ANY LEISURE PLANS IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP THEIR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS. AND FINALLY- WRAPPING THAT IN BRAND INSPIRATION- IT TOO YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY UNDER TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR BUSINESSES ARE LEANING IN- SIGNIFICANTLY ON CLEAN AND SAFE PROTOCOLS. BUT THERE IS STILL AN INSPIRATION AND ARRESTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO YOU AND YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT ALSO HAVE PIVOTED AND TAKEN THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY- AND BRACING FACE COVERINGS DISTANCING POLICIES EARLY ON. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT MANY OF THE LINE WORKERS ACTUALLY HAVE TO ENFORCE THOSE RULES AS OPPOSED TO EVERYBODY BEING COMPLIANT WITH THEM AND THEY'VE HAD TO PUT THEMSELVES IN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA. ARE STAYING SAFE TO SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY WE HAD VISIT CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN ON A MANTRA AROUND AMPLIFYING THIS MESSAGE AND WE CAME OUT WITH THE RESPECT CALIFORNIA RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL CODE WHICH SHARED ACROSS THE STATE OUR OWN CHANNELS WHICH HAVE ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION FOLLOWERS DIGITALLY- AND REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE HEADING OUT TO JUST SIMPLY DO THEIR HOMEWORK ABOUT THE SITUATION AT ANY RESPECTIVE LOCAL DESTINATION. THEY PLAN TO BENEFITS VISIT- IT SO IT'S PART OF THAT IS A MULTI CHANNEL CAMPAIGN AND IT'S NOW BEING LED BY A PARTNERSHIP WE ACTUALLY HAVE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION- WOULD LEADING WITH A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT ENCOURAGES A SAFE TRAVEL BUT AGAIN IN THIS KIND OF SIGNATURE BRAND WRAPPED INSPIRATIONAL TONE. WE CALL IT NEVER MEANT NORMAL- AND I'D LOVE TO SHARE IT WITH YOU GUYS TODAY MMHM. THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT GETTING BACK TO NORMAL. BUT IN CALIFORNIA NORMAL'S NEVER REALLY BEEN OR ANY. SEMESTER MANDATORY. THAT'S ARE KIND OF PART KEEPING OUR DISTANCE CAN BE AND IF YOU'RE NOT WASHING YOUR HANDS A LOT ALREADY MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING DIRTY SO IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL NO PROBLEM FOR MORE WITH TAKE IN STRIDE AND RIDE IT OUT HELP CALIFORNIA STAY SAFE AND OPEN LEARN MORE AND VISIT CALIFORNIA .COM. SO TAKE I'M FINE YEAH VERY FINE ALL THE MASS. SO TO KIND OF DOUBLE CLICK ON THIS WE ALSO DONE AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I SHOULD NOTE FOR THE RECORD THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE EVER PIVOTED SINCE NINE ELEVEN TO DO IN STATE MARKETING- AND THAT AND THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE USUALLY THE INDUSTRY DOES THAT ON THEIR OWN AND MOVES PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE BUT THIS TIME THE INDUSTRY ASKED US GIVEN. THE RESOURCE DEFICIT AS A RESULT OF COVE AND FOR US TO STEP IN AND CREATE KIND OF A CO OP PLATFORM ACROSS ALL OUR CHANNELS TO INSPIRE CALIFORNIANS STAIN AND STATE SO AGAIN THE CONSUMER FIRST AND FOREMOST IS CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY AND WE REALLY WANTED TO LEAN IN AND AMPLIFY THE GREAT WORK THE INDUSTRY'S BEEN DOING IN THIS SPACE NOT JUST FROM A BIGGER BRAND PLATFORM BUT BY INDUSTRY CATEGORY SO WE'VE ALSO DEVELOPED A SET OF COMPLEMENTARY DIGITAL VIDEO. CALLED SAFE TRAVELS CALIFORNIA THE TALKS ABOUT- WHAT A GREAT TIME YOU CN HAVE WHILE YOUR HOTELS FOR EXAMPLE OR RENTAL CAR COMPANIES OR DESTINATIONS ARE- KEEPING THEIR CONSUMER SAFE SO I'VE GOT THREE I JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH- THE FIRST TO FOCUS ON HOTELS AND RENTAL CARS WITH THE FAMILY VACATION MARKET- THE THIRD- HIGHLIGHTS THE WINE COUNTRY AND WE WILL RELEASE THAT WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AND WE GET PAST THE WILD FIRE SEASON SO WERE QUEUING UP FOR. OUR HELPING TO SUPPORT OUR WINE COUNTRY AS WELL SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THREE. THESE PARENTS ARE IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY IT'S CALLED FINALLY TAKING A VACATION. TRAVELING THE CALIFORNIA COAST WITH CONFIDENCE BECAUSE THEY PICKED UP A RENTAL CAR IN A TOUCHLESS PROCESS. AS THROUGH STRESS PROTOCOLS. SURE IS IT THEY CAN TAKE THEM SO OUT BEFORE THE TIDE ROLLS IN. STAYING SAFE MEANS STAYING OPEN FOR AND VISIT COME DOT. THIS GUY IS IN A STRANGE POSITION IT'S CALLED RELAXING ON A MID WEEK GETAWAY HE'S IT EASIER BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HOTELS AND RESORTS ARE FOLLOWING STRICT SPACING AND SANITIZING PROTOCOLS TO KEEP GUESTS SAFE. BUT ONE QUESTION DOES PUZZLE HIM WHAT IS IN THIS DELICIOUS BEVERAGE. ALAS THAT MYSTERY WILL REMAIN UNSOLVED FOR NOW STAYING SAFE MEANS STAYING OPEN LEARN MORE AND VISIT CALIFORNIA .COM. THIS COUPLE IS IN AN UNFAMILIAR SITUATION IT'S THE LONG AWAITED EVENING. YES THEY CAN RELAX THANKS TO THE STRING SPACING AND SANITIZING PROTOCOLS THAT CALIFORNIA'S WINERIES AND RESTAURANTS SO THEY'RE ONLY DILEMMA. IS WHO GETS TO ENJOY THIS MASTER PIECE OF CHEESE. AND WITH THAT THE SHORT QUESTION IS ANSWERED STAYING SAFE MEANS STAYING OPEN LEARN MORE AND VISIT CALIFORNIA .COM. SO WITH THAT I'LL JUST CLOSE ON A FINAL SLIDE WE'RE SINCE THE OUTBREAK OF COVE AND WE'VE STARTED A WEEKLY NEWSLETTER THAT I DO WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS BUT WE UPDATE CURRENT CONSUMER SENTIMENT THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND ON A WEEKLY BASIS SO I. THOUGHT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE JUST TO SHARE THAT IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED OR YOUR STAFF'S INTERESTED IN GETTING THAT NEWSLETTER SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE TIME IN THE INTEREST TODAY I'M HAPPY TO ASK. OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR- SENATOR I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SHARING THIS- VIDEOS WITH US AND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING I CAN YOU MAYBE JUST TOUCH ON YAK IN TERMS OF FOR CALIFORNIA TOURISM INDUSTRY WITH KOBE- SORT OF INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL TO CALIFORNIA INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS AND THEN I GUESS THE MASTIC FROM WITHIN THE US THAT WAS WELL SO- YOU KNOW. UNFORTUNATELY I KNOW AMERICANS ARE BANNED FROM TRAVELING TO A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES- SO- WE BECAUSE OF OUR MISHANDLING TO COPE WITH THAT PANDEMIC BUT ALSO THAT MAKES EACH YEAR FOR INTERNET SALES CAN YOU SPEAK TO IS THERE IS THAT SIMILE DROPPED- DO YOU SEE- DIFFERENTIAL THERE DO YOU SEE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL VERSES ESSENTIALLY DOMESTIC A REST OF THIS COUNTRY I TRAVEL- TOURISM YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS A MULTI PHASED APPROACH OF KIND OF MOVING OUT IN THE OPENING AND THAT'S BASED ON CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. SO PHASE ONE IS THIS PIVOT IN STATE CALLING ALL CALIFORNIANS CAMPAIGN PAYS PHASE TWO WILL BE WESTERN FEEDER AND AGAIN WE JUST WE REACT TO CONSUMER SENTIMENT SO- THAT CAMPAIGN IS CALLED CALLUM CALIFORNIANS COLLEEN AND WE EXPECT TO RULE THAT OUT AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR BASED O THE WILL OF CONSUMERS TRAVELING FURTHER THAN A COUPLE HOURS FROM HOME- PHASE THREE- IS A CAMPAIGN WERE ROLLING OUT LATER IN THE SPRING CALLED ALL DREAMS ALWAYS WELCOME ANTICIPATING CONSUMER SENTIMENT AROUND GETTING ON AIRPLANES- AND THAT WOULD BREACH OVER 50% OF THEIR INTEREST IN TRAVELING THAT FAR. AND THEN FINALLY YOU KNOW PHASE FOUR IS NEW NORMAL AND NOT IS GOING BACK INTO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET SO WE'VE SEEN PRECIPITOUS DROP OFF WE CLOSED ALL FOURTEEN INTERNATIONAL OFFICES FRANKLY BECAUSE THE SENTIMENT THE WILL IS NOT THERE I'M NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE AREN'T TRAVELING BUT IT'S. EXTREMELY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AS WELL OF. WHAT WE'RE IN OF INTERNET AIRLINE TRENDS AS MANY OF OUR KEY PRIMARY MARKETS- WERE SEEN SOME OPENING OF. AIRLINES IN THE END OF MARCH TIME FRAME THEY'VE ANNOUNCED FOR. DIRECT FLIGHTS OUT OF SHANGHAI SYDNEY FOR EXAMPLE CANADA- EUROPE SO WE'RE TRACKING EACH AND EVERY AIRLINE AND THERE IS THIS LINE UP AROUND THE END OF MARCH AT LEAST TODAY SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING SO WE ARE. NOT ACTIVELY MARKETING INTERNATIONAL HOWEVER WE'VE KEPT A- I'LL A LOW THRESHOLD RETAINER BECAUSE WHEN WE START TO OPEN WILL START WITH THE TRAVEL TRADE SO WE NEED TO START WORKING THOSE MARKET SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT RECOVERY BUT- IT'S AS YOU DESCRIBED A VERY DIRE SITUATION AND A WAYS OFF RIGHT NOW. I GUESS ONE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK IT'S SORT OF THAT IN YOUR MESSAGING IS THAT- THE STATE'S THAT SHOW THE BEST RECORD AND KEEPING THE IN KEEPING COVERED UNDER CONTROL AND I KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE CONVENTION INDUSTRY. I KNOW THAT- YOU SEEM LIKE YOU EXPRESSED CONCERN OF ME HERE FOR FURTHER ON IN THIS HEARINGS THAT WE'RE LOSING IT TO OTHER STATES BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF THE OTHER STATES ARE HAVING INCREASING CASES AND IF YOU'RE MAKING A RESERVATION FOR WHETHER IT'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWENTY THREE- WE SHOULD BE TALKING TO PEOPLE THAT. YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOUSE. WHICH STATES ARE MORE SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE A RESERVATION. FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND OF THAT STATE'S NOT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY I THINK WE CAN NAME SOME STATES WHERE LEADERSHIP HASN'T. DETERRED YOU YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF OUT OF CONVENTION AND SUDDENLY HAVING TO THE STAND EVEN IF KOBE IT'S ACTUALLY UNDER CONTROL IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY INCLUDING HOPEFULLY CALIFORNIA SO. I AGREE AND THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT I SHOULD OF. BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE. IN THE INTENT TO OF THE INDUSTRY AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM OTHERS OF STARTING OUT. WITH VERY SMALL MEETINGS TO DIP THEIR TOE IN THE STAND AND REALLY START TO BUILD THAT TRACK RECORD I SUBSCRIBE TO THIS I THINK WE'RE IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE- AND SHARE YOUR SENTIMENT- AND- AND- LOOK AT. YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE TREATING OTHER GATHERINGS BUT REALLY FOCUSING ON. SMALL ENGAGEMENTS OF LESS THAN A HUNDRED JUST TO START DOWN THAT PATHWAY AND ESTABLISH WHAT WORKS IN TERMS OF THOSE CLEAN AND SAFE PROTOCOLS. HATS OFF TO US THAT WE ARE IN A GOOD SITUATION COMPLETELY AGREE. NOW PLAYING THANK YOU AND I GUESS I WAS JUST THAT THAT THE LAST COMMENT I MAKE ABOUT IT IS THAT. IT IS DEPENDENT ON EACH AND EVERYONE OF US WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN IT'S NOT BECAUSE GOVERNMENTS TELLING YOU TO DO SOMETHING. I WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM PEOPLE ABOUT JOBS AND ECONOMIC COUNTY ME AND SO WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GO OUTSIDE. AND THINK SHOULD I WEAR MY MASK THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GO TO WORK BECAUSE THIS VIRUS AND IF YOU WEAR A GET. BACK TO THEIR JOBS COMES OUT LATELY AGREE AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR THE FRUSTRATION OF THE PANEL THAT'S COMING AFTER ME ABOUT. HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ENFORCE THIS WITH CONSUMERS AND HAVING THAT UNANIMITY SO- THAT'S WHY WE KIND OF STEPPED IN TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT COVER FOR THE INDUSTRY IT'S SO IMPORTANTAND WE SUBSCRIBE TO THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU MANAGER OUT ONE QUICK QUESTION ONE MORE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS YOU REFERENCE THE FACT THAT CONVENTION BUSINESS IS NOT COMING IN CALIFORNIA IT'S GOING ELSEWHERE I'M ASSUMING IT'S STAYING IN THE STATES WHERE THE ODDITIES ASSOCIATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR ARE WE LOSING CONVENTION BUSINESS TO OTHER STATES THAT ARE SOMEHOW MORE COMPETITIVE WITH US- AND IT'S NOT ABOUT KIND OF TRY TO MINIMIZE TRAVEL. THERE IS THERE IS A CROSS CUT WERE WERE ACTUALLY LOSING BUSINESSES TO OTHER STATES I DON'T WANT TO ARTICULATE TO SAY THAT WE LOST SIXTY FIVE BILLION SO THERE FOR SIXTY FIVE BILLION IS GOING ELSEWHERE THERE IS A PIECE OF THAT THAT'S GOING ELSEWHERE THERE'S A PIECE THAT STAYING CLOSER TO HOME THAT WE KNOW BECAUSE WE TALKED OR ARE COMPETITON EVERY DAY OF THE OTHER STATES BOOKING AND PICKING UP THAT BUSINESS IT MAY NOT BE HOLISTICALLY SIXTY SIX BILLION AS I SAID BUT- A GOOD SHARE OF THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PLAN SO FAR OUT- IS BEING LOST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT OPEN. TO BOOK BUSINESS TODAY. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE DISCUSSING IS AND INSENSITIVE TO YOUR COMMENTS CENTER PAM IS. THAT THE EVEN IF THEY BALK BUSINESS THREE YEARS OUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE INDUSTRY WON'T POSTPONE IT EVEN WITH OUR OWN BOARD MEETINGS WE'VE- GONE VIRTUAL WE POSTPONE IN THE INDUSTRY IS VERY FLEXIBLE AND RESILIENT- BUT I THINK THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A PLAN. YOU KNOW TWO TO THREE YEARS OUT THAT THEY'VE MARKED IT ON THE BOOKS AND EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO. AT LEAST THEY'RE OUT BEING ABLE TO OPEN THE SALE THAT THAT THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ACTUALLY HOLDING THE MEETING. AND THEN- OF COURSE I'M GONNA ASK YOU AND EVERYONE WHO COMES TO THIS- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OVERVIEW AND I THINK- THE NEXT PANEL IS ALSO GOING TO BE A BIT OF AN OVERVIEW BUT I'D LIKE EVERYONE WHO'S SPEAKING. IF YOU COULD TELL US YOU'RE THE TOP THREE THINGS YOU WISH THE STATE COULD DO. RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT THAT WOULD HELP I'M JUST GOING TO TRY TO GET THAT SURVEY FROM EVERYBODY. WHAT WOULD IT BE. RIGHT THANK. I WILL SAY WITH REGARD TO LEISURE TRAVEL I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN SOME PRETTY GOOD COOPERATION. I THINK CONSISTENCY IS KEY ACROSS ALL. BUSINESS SECTORS AS WELL AS- COUNTIES SO JUST TRYING TO BE. CONSISTENT AND KEEP. THE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LOCAL COUNTY HEART HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS THE POP YOU KNOW THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THAT IS KEY. AND THEN THIS THIS ISSUE OF TRYING TO CLARIFY CONSISTENCY AROUND TEARS. AND ALLOWING- COMMITTEE OPEN COMMUNICATION FOR THOSE SECTORS THAT ARE STILL NOT OPEN LIKE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM TODAY. TO AT LEAST LISTEN WITH ALL SERIOUSNESS OF. THE EXTENT THE INDUSTRY'S GOING TO. TO APPLY THOSE SAFE AND CLEAN PROTOCOLS. I THINK IS CRITICAL SO THAT THAT WE HAVE- UNANIMITY AMONGST A BLUEPRINT FOR. SAFE THREE OPENINGS. THAT THAT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY WELL DONE AND WE APPRECIATE THAT WE- I KNOW I'M TAKING NOTES AND WE WILL. MAKE SURE WE GET I LIKE THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND KIND OF A SURVEY HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO LEAVE. THIS HEARING WITH SOME ACTION ITEMS SO WE APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU THANK. YOU MADAM CHAIR. I THINK THE- NEXT WE HAVE COMING UP TO READ TO A IS HOW CAL. TOURISM HAS WEATHERED THE PANDEMIC. AND NOW THE IMPACT ON WORKERS BUSINESS OWNERS AND LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE WILL HAVE JOE ELLIS SANDRO ON WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF SAN FRANCISCO TRAVEL. WELCOME THANK YOU. SO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY AND TALKING TO THIS ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US- I LIKE TO DO A SPECIAL SET OUT TO SEE MEMBER CHIU WHO REPRESENTS MY DISTRICT AND IT'S BEEN A- LONG TERM- A SUPPORTER OF TOURISM AND SAMUS IS GOING TO OUT CITY CALIFORNIA- IT'S ALSO GREAT TO BE BACK HERE IN MY HOMETOWN OF SACRAMENTO TO- TO SEE IT'S BEGINNING TO HAVE THE RECOVERY TO AND THE NEXT STEP IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE TO GO FORWARD. MY NAME IS JOE DALLESANDRO THE PRESIDENCY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO TRAVEL ASSOCIATION. IT'S THE NONPROFIT DESTINATION MARKETING ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO- PROMOTE SAN FRANCISCO IS A PREMIER DESTINATION FOR MEETINGS. CONVENTIONS EVENTS EVENTS AND LEISURE TRAVEL. LIKE VISIT CALIFORNIA WE ALSO WERE STARTED BY A BY A DISASTER AND THAT WAS THE NINETEEN OH SIX EARTHQUAKE. WE WERE FOUNDED IN NINETEEN OH NINE- WITH THE GROUP OF PROGRESSIVE BUSINESS LEADERS WHO THOUGHT THAT SAN FRANCISCO BEING SO FAR OUT FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. GOOD REBOUNDER ECONOMY TO TRAVEL AND TOURISM AND WE'RE THE ONE THE OLDEST DESTINATION MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW BASED ON THAT- THAT THOUGHTFUL THINKING BACK THEN. WE'RE ESPECIALLY PROUD THAT OUR RESIDENTS AND GOVERNMENT HAVE WORKED HARD TO MINIMIZE THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN. YOU KNOW WITH THE FIRST CITY THEY WOULD DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY THE UNITED STATES. THE PERSON DID TO GO INTO LOCKDOWN AND WE ALSO HAVE THE BEST. COATED RECOVERY RATES OF ANY MAJOR CITY IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE VERY.% PROUD OF THE LEADERSHIP IN OUR CITY IN THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THEY MADE EARLY ON BUT IT'S BENEFITING TO THE- CITIZENS OF SAN FRANCISCO TODAY AND THE VISITORS TO SAN FRANCISCO TODAY. THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO DEVASTATE A TOURISM BUSINESSES- HOTELS RESTAURANTS MEETING FACILITIES TOURISM ATTRACTIONS SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESS AND TOURISM RELATED RETAIL ARE ALL DEVASTATED BY THE IMPACTS OF THIS THIS PANDEMIC AFTER TEN YEARS OF TEN PLUS YEARS OF GROWTH VISITORS SPENDING WILL DROP 67% IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY. I'M AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT THESE DROPS OF SPENDING AND VISITATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WAS PRETTY NORMAL IT WAS IT WE WERE HEADED INTO A VERY STRONG YEAR. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT FELL OFF THE FACE SO THE NUMBERS THAT WE PRESENT TO YOU OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY KEEP IN MIND THAT THAT FIRST QUARTER WAS A FAIRLY HEALTHY FIRST QUARTER AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT FELL APART. NEXT YOU WERE PLANNING ON AN UPTICK BUT WE STILL. WILL STILL BE DOWN 40% AT LEAST FROM TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. FROM NINE POINT SIX BILLION TO ABOUT. ESTIMATED FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION IN TOURISM. ANY HOTELS WERE FORCED TO CLOSE WITH OCCUPANCY RATES AT AN ALL TIME LOW SOME WILL BE CLOSED PERMANENTLY. THOUSANDS REMAIN WITHOUT JOBS. ANY BY INTERNATIONAL VISITORS I WILL DECREASE 72% THIS YEAR. AN OVERALL 67% FEWER INTERNATIONAL RIVAL RIVALS WITH THE DROP FROM CHINA NEARLY 73% AND 69% FOR YOUR- TRADITIONALLY THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR A MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGE OF VISITORS SPENDING AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT SAN FRANCISCO. WHEN SPENDING COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL VISITORS TO THE CITY. BECAUSE RECOVERY WILL BE pDRIVEN BY MAINLY BY DOMESTIC TRAVELER VISITOR SPENDING WILL TAKE LONGER TO RECOVER BECAUSE DOMESTIC TRAVELERS TEND TO SPEND LESS THAN INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS IN THE STATE'S SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE EVEN LONGER FOR US TO RECOVER. THE LOST OF THE CONVENTION BUSINESS IN SAN FRANCISCO IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE DECLINE IN THE THING THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN A RECORD ONE POINT TWO MILLION CONVENTION NIGHTS WERE BOOKED AT HOTELS IN SAN FRANCISCO. THIS YEAR WE EXPECT THE NUMBER TO CLOSE OUT AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND. WITH MOST OF THOSE COMING IN THE FIRST QUARTER. SO FAR FORTY GROUPS HAVE CANCELED OFF THE BOOKS AND TO TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TODAY WE GOT FOUR MORE CANCELLATIONS FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CANCELLATION OF CITY WIDE CONVENTIONS ALONE REPRESENT A LOSS AND DIRECT-SPENDING OF OVER SIX HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO ALONE. THE CITY IS DEVELOP PROTOCOLS FOR FUTURE LARGE MEETINGS SOCIAL DISTANCING ROLES ENHANCE SANITATION REQUIREMENTS AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT FOR EMPLOYEES INSISTS SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT FOR VISITORS SO WE DO NOT WANT TO TAKE ANY STEPS. THAT WILL ENSURE THE SAFETY- AS WE OPEN UP THE CITY TO A FUTURE TRAVEL. SAN FRANCISCO TRAVEL DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NORMAL OPERATIONS TO RETURN INTO A LEASE THEN LATER PART OF NEXT YEAR. BUT ONLY EFFECTS SEEN IN RAPID TESTING IS READILY AVAILABLE. WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THE SAN FRANCISCO WE'LL SEE THE NUMBERS THAT WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND NINEEEN UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR OR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE. I RESEARCH THAT- IT'S NOT JUST SAN FRANCISCO THAT'S AFFECTED BY THIS LACK OF MEETING BUSINESS AND THE MEETING BUSINESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR. FOR TOURISM WE TALK A LOT ABOUT LEISURE STARTING TO COME BACK THAT'S TRUE IN A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS OR SEEN LEISURE TRAVEL. BUT IT'S MAINLY ON WEEKENDS AND THE URBAN AREAS DO NOT SEE THE SAME AND LEISURE. TRAVELERS AT SOME OF THE RESORT AREA SEE SO WE NEED TO FIND DEMAND DRIVERS TO BRING PEOPLE BACK INTO OUR CITIES AND BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND MEETINGS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LEISURE TRAVEL I MEAN BEYOND MAJOR TRAVEL WE'D LOVE TO HAVE A MEETING LIKE THIS IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE CAN'T DO THAT TODAY THIS AND AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST SAN FRANCISCO THAT'S BEING AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF BUSINESS MEETINGS. AND THE BUSINESS NEED MEANING SECTORS COLLAPSING ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. RULES WILL NOT ALLOW A LARGE INDOOR GATHERINGS DESPITE DISTANCING SANITATION PROTOCOLS THAT HAVE PROVOKED PROVIDED. SUCCESSFUL ELSEWHERE. IN PALM SPRINGS ON MEETING HAVE BEEN LOST FOR THIS YEAR AND THEY'RE BEGINNING TO BE KANSEN FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR. THE COACHELLA VALLEY ALONE HAS LOST THREE POINT ONE BILLION IN VISITOR SPENDING SPENDING. MANY PLANNERS CAN'T WAIT FOR CALIFORNIA TO ISSUE GUIDANCE AT VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER STATE IS ISSUED. THEY'RE MAKING PLANS TO TAKE THEIR BUSINESS THEIR DOLLARS ELSEWHERE THIS IS OUR OF OUR BIGGEST CONCERN BECAUSE- WE WORK WITH A PLANNER WHO WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MEETING HERE FOR THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THEY CAN'T FEEL THAT WE CAN GUARANTEE IT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS NOT ESTABLISHED THOSE. PROTOCOLS YET SO THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF MY TOP THREE THINGS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATING IN ADVANCE TO A PLAN IS BECAUSE MANY OF THESE CONVENTIONS. ARE PLANNED YEARS IN ADVANCE AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE OUT OF LUCK FOR THENEXT RECOVERY TIME THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR YEARS IF WE CAN'T START BOOKING THOSE CONVENTIONS WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO COME BACK ONLINE. MANY CRITICAL TO- CALIFORNIANS ARE THE SMALL MEETINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO START WITH WE REALIZE THAT THE ABILITY TO LARGE. DO LARGE CITY WIDE CONVENTIONS ARE LARGE EVENTS IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN ANY TIME SOON. WE DO FEEL THAT WE'RE IN A POSITION THAT WE'RE READY TO HOLD SMALL MEETINGS MUCH LIKE THIS. MEETING IN HOTELS AND OTHER MEETING VENUES AND AROUND THE STATE. WE CAN'T DO THAT AT THIS POINT BUT THIS IS GONNA BE ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT. BABY STEPS. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE MEETINGS WE DO HAVE THE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE WE FEEL THE SAFETY IN PLACE BECAUSE THAT IS PARAMOUNT. BUT THAT IS THE NEXT UP WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE HAPPEN. THE PANDEMIC IS ALSO COST HUNDREDS OF MILLION DOLLARS IN TOURISM RELATED. REVENUE DATA TAX REVENUE. RELATED TOURISM REVENUE SPORTS VITAL CITY SERVICES IMPORT AND ENJOYED BY RESIDENTS AND VISITORS. IN SAN FRANCISCO ALONE ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS OF LOCAL TAX MONEY IS GENERATED BY. BY VISITORS AND WE'RE GONNA SEE THAT DECIMATED THIS YEAR. ADDITIONALLY VISITORS TO OUR CITY CENTER STATE SUPPORTER RESTAURANTS CULTURAL INSTITUTION THE ARTS ATTRACTIONS NIGHTLIFE SPORTS AND BELOVED OPEN SPACES AND AMENITIES THAT DEFINE OUR DESTINATION AND PROVIDE FOR THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT OUR RESIDENTS HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO. I RESIDENT COMMUNITIES ALONE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THESE BELOVED ACTIVITIES WE NEED OUR VISITORS AND OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TO SUPPORT THE RESTAURANTS WE NEED THE VISITORS TO SUPPORT THE ARTS AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO VISITORS TO ATTEND SPORTING EVENTS ARE WE ALONE IS RESIDENTS CANNOT SUPPORT THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT IS SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL OF US THAT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU NO HOTEL TAXES AND MOST CALIFORNIA ZIP A CITIES CONTRIBUTE TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT TO LOCAL CITY BUDGETS. THEY ARE TAXES PAID BY TOURISTS TO FIND SERVICES THAT BENEFIT ALL RISK RESIDENTS INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY SALARIES AND OTHER MUNICIPAL OPERATIONS. IN SAN FRANCISCO TO SUCCEED CITY COMPTROLLER EXPECTS. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM LOCAL HOTEL TAXES IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ACROSS ALL FUNDS. THAT 63% LESS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION. THAT WAS BUDGETED LAST FISCAL YEAR. AGAIN THE SAME STORY IS PLAYING OUT ACROSS THE STATE. IN ANAHEIM WHERE TOURISM TAXES MAKE UP ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE BUDGET. THE LOCKDOWN LAST SPRING BECAUSE THE FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL 31% AND HOTEL TAX COLLECTIONS. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR THAT STARTED IN JULY COLLECTIONS ARE PROJECTED TO DROP ANOTHER THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. TO EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL 62% DROP OF THE TWO FISCAL YEARS. WITH STATE LINES FOR THEME PARK RE OPENING AND THE RESUMPTION OF BUSINESS MEETINGS FAR FROM CERTAIN. RECOVERY RIGHT AWAY- FOR SOME CITIES REMAINS ELUSIVE. SO TOURISM IS EXTREMELY CRITICAL COMPONENT FOR OUR- CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IT GENERATES MILLIONS OF JOBS BILLIONS IN TAXES BILLIONS OF THE VISITOR SPENDING AND ENHANCES OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. HOWEVER WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG VERY SLOW RECOVERY THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO THE COLLABORATION WE WORK TOGETHER WITH OTHER DESTINATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO BE DISTURBANCE. PROTOCOLS THAT ARE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE NOT CONSISTENCY IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER WE REALIZE IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG SLOW RECOVERY IT CAN BE DONE BUT WE NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE AND THE PATIENCE AND SUPPORT OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN- THE THREE THINGS THAT I WOULD GET BACK TO YOUR QUESTION. ASSEMBLY INTO THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT IS WHAT CAROLINE SAID IS CONSISTENCY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR A VISITOR BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE JIG YOU POLITICAL BOUNDARIES IN OUR STATE THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN ACROSS IN A COUNTY BORDER CITY ORDER. THE CONSISTENCY IN RULES AND REGULATIONS WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT STATE BUDGET FACE A MASK MANDATES ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE MORE REQUIREMENTS THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE THE SORT OF CONSISTENCY. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW IS THE ABILITY TO HAVE SMALL MEETINGS AS A DEMAND DRIVERS- WE BELIEVE MUCH LIKE A LOT OF OTHER BUSINESSES THAT OPEN AT LIMITED CAPACITY WE CAN OPEN OUR HOTELS IN A MEETING VENUES TO SMALL MEETINGS. SAFELY AND WITH THE PROPER SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND SANITATION PROTOCOLS IN PLACE- AND I THINK THAT THAT IS PROBABLY THE NEXT STEP THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WE BELIEVE IT CAN BE DONE MUCH LIKE CHURCHES HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN DO RESTAURANTS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN DO. THEATERS HAVE SHOWN THAT WE CAN DO SO CAN WE AND MEETING INDUSTRY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CRITICAL NEXT STEPS OF OUR OPENING STRATEGY. SO I'M HERE IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. BUT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO. THANK YOU I JUST STONE. I HAD ONE THOUGHT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME GROUPS THAT ARE KIND OF IN TRAIN IN WHAT WE CALL A HYBRID MODEL WHERE THEY'RE USING HOTEL SPACE CONFERENCE ROOMS BUT THEY'RE ALSO ALLOWING- THEIR PARTS OF THE GROUP THAT DON'T FEEL. THAT THEY'RE READY TO DO THAT TO KIND OF ZOO MAN- HAVE IF YOU SEE ANY OF THAT STARTING TO HAPPEN WE CERTAINLY HAVE A PLANNER SO WE'RE TALKING A LOT TO THEM ABOUT THAT EVEN IN THE LARGER CONVENTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE A MOSCONI CENTER OF HAVING A HYBRID VIRTUAL AND IN PERSON MEETING WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST STEP IN IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT IS AS IS THE INDUSTRY WE'RE MAKING. TAKEN STEPS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALL THIS AND BE ABLE TO OPEN TO LARGE MEETINGS INSTANTLY SO WE BELIEVE THIS HYBRID APPROACH IS THE WAY TO EASE INTO IT TO SHOWCASE HOW WE CAN DO I MEAN SAFETY SAFELY AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE A LOT OF OUR MEETINGS AND SEVEN CISCO EVEN MEDICAL MEETINGS ARE ARCHITECT MEETINGS AND THE MEDICAL MEETINGS ARE PRIMARILY MADE UP OF DOCTORS WHO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFETY PROTOCOLS. RIGHT NOW THEY CAN'T EVEN ME AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS NEXT UP A HYBRID MEETING WITH PART VIRTUAL PART IN PERSON. WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT AND- THANK. THE SCHOOLS ARE STARTING OUT AS A AS OF OUR TO. THIS WAS A SOLDIER. WELCOME TO THE CAP I'M REALLY PLEASED THE PRESENT. I THINK YOU COVER WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR. A CURE BECAUSE I KNOW THE- NOT HERE. WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE OF MEETINGS AND HOW CLOSE ARE WE OR THEY TO. MOVING FORWARD WITH SOME GUIDANCE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF A COALITION OF CALIFORNIA. CITIES THAT HAVE CONVENTION CENTERS AND IN PLACE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE- CAL TRAVEL TO- TO. GET THAT NEXT STEP THEY'RE WEIRD LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY MOVEMENT ON IT TO BE HONEST THERE'S A LOT OF. FRUSTRATION A LOT OF JOBS AT STAKE- AGAIN WE BELIEVE WE CAN DO THIS SAFELY. STARTING SMALL. AND GOING TO THE NEXT LEVEL AS YOU KNOW SAN FRANCISCO IS ALREADY IN THE ORANGE. ZONE WHICH SHOULD ALLOW US TO BE OPEN AND LIMITED CAPACITY FOR SOME OF THE- MEETINGS LIKE THIS WE HAVE. HAD LOTS F COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE HAVE NOT. HAD THE GO AHEAD YEAH. I WHAT I WOULD SAY AND I KNOW I'M SURE THIS THE CASE FOR A COLLEAGUE SO MANY OF US GET PULLED IN BY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES TO- HELP. FACILITATE CONVERSATIONS WITH ADMINISTRATION ABOUT RE OPENING GUIDELINES AND IF IT'S- NOT FOR SURE THE- ARCHER AND MYSELF AND OTHERS- DOCTOR PAN WE'D ALL BE WILLING TO. TO HELP SO. JUST OFFER THAT OFFICE AS A SUGGESTION IF WE CAN BE ENGAGED. HAPPY WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT SUPPORT. THANK SENATOR THANK YOU- AND ACTUALLY- I'LL POINT OUT ACTUALLY DOOR TO MEDICAL OF NATIONAL MEDICAL MEETINGS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR- THAT I WAS GOING TO ATTEND AT THE BUSINESS COUNCIL DOESN'T OPEN LARGE SCALE THEY WEREN'T SAN FRANCISCO WOULD FORTUNATELY BUT- WILL BECOME THEIR NEXT AREA LOOKING ACCENTS BUT I JUST WANT IT AND YOU KNOW MY OTHER HAT IS NOW IN SESSION I CHAIRED THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE SO I HAVE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE- DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE DO OVERSIGHT OVER THAT. YOU CAN TEASE PARTICULARLY YOU TALKED ABOUT WELL YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT THE OPENING SMALLER MEETINGS BUT- IN TERMS OF PARTICULARLY YOU SAID THAT WE'RE A DISADVANTAGE FOR COMPETING FOR CONVENTIONS. NEXT YOU KNOW YEARS OUT SO IS IT THAT'S OTHER STATES ARE DOING THAT CALIFORNIA'S AND DOING THAT'S GIVING THEM THE ADVANTAGE TO BOOK A CONVENTION IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE LET'S SAY OUR TWENTY TWENTY THE L. FOUR. KEY TEAM YEAH YEAH SO WHAT'S HAPPENED OTHER STATES AND I'LL JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOME STATES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA STATE OF WASHINGTON- ARE VERY SIMILAR IN CALIFORNIA VERY SIMILAR APPROACH TO THE- THE KOBE CRISIS THE GOVERNOR IS ALREADY. ALLOWED MEETINGS AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE AGAIN SPACE WITH ALL THE PROTOCOL IN PLACE TO START HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON WE CAN'T DO THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO IF YOU HAVE A- GROUP WE'RE LOOKING AT WELL PLACED A FULL GROUP OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE TOGETHER. YOUR CHOICE IS COMING TO A PLACE IN CALIFORNIA PLACE IN WASHINGTON STATE YOU CAN DO IT WATCHING STATE. STATE OF NEVADA GOVERNOR IS DOING THE SAME THING WITH THEIR STARTING I BELIEVE THEIR NUMBER IS MORE LIKE A THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA START HAVING SO. PLANNERS IS THEY'RE ANXIOUS TO HAVE THEIR MEETINGS NOW ARE LOOKING WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS MEETING. AND MAKE NAY THEY DON'T THEY CAN'T TAKE IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT OTHER PLACES THAT ARE ALLOWING THEM TO TAKE THEIR MEETINGS WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE UNKNOWN FACTORS THAT WE HAVE NOT SET UP ANY OF THESE PROTOCOLS IN CALIFORNIA YET FROM THE FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE. SO IF YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE A PLANNER LOOKING AT A MEDICAL MEETING OR ANY TYPE OF MEETING AND YOU'RE THINKING WHERE CAN I GO WE DON'T KNOW WHEN CALIFORNIA'S GONNA COME UP WITH A PROTOCOL SO LET'S GO TO A PLACE. THAT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED ANNOUNCES PROTOCOLS SUGGEST HE GETS A CHALLENGE. OKAY SO JUST TO BE CLEAR. THERE'S THAT WHAT'S- RIGHT NOW WE DON'T. WHAT YOU KNOW LATE NEXT YEAR I DON'T KNOW NO STATE ARE THOSE STATES MAKING COMMITMENTS THAT THEY'RE PREDICTING THAT THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY OPEN I MEAN- NEXT YEAR AND- WE'RE BEING MORE HONEST AND NOT SAYING WE CAN OR IS IT BECAUSE OF OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT SOME OF THE CARE UNLESS OR DISTINGUISH BETWEEN. RIGHT CURRENT SITUATION. WHERE YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME STATES ARE SAYING AND I DON'T KNOW IT'S A GOOD IDEA OR NOT TO TEAR SAYING THAT OR NOT. VERSES SAYING THAT WHILE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT BOOKING A MEETING AND YOU KNOW SOLVED. EVEN AS EARLY AS FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SAYING WELL WE DON'T PUT IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE'RE WILLING TO BOOK IN THIS OTHER STATE BECAUSE THEY'RE- ALLOWING STUFF NOW. SO I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING. CENTER IS THAT- PLANNERS WHO HAVE TO PLAN THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESS- EXPENSE TO HOLD A MEETING AND WATER COMMITMENT IN ADVANCE TO HOLD A MEETING. SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT AT THE STATE THAT HAS- PROTOCOLS THAT ARE BEING ANNOUNCED FOR GATHERINGS ANNOUNCER MEETINGS AND THINKING. THAT'S PROBABLY A SAFER BET THAN THAN BETTING ON CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY HAVEN'T EVEN ANNOUNCED ANY SORT OKAY SO STRATEGY. SO IF CALIFORNIA SAID LOOK. WE'LL HAVE A PROTOCOL WE'RE NOT OPEN NOW FOR. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE AT SURVIVOR X. RIGHT. BECAUSE OF. WHATEVER STAGING. BUT THEY SAID BUT WE HAVE A PROTOCOL THAT YOU KNOW. IT'S THIS AREA YOU KNOW WE'RE AT RED OR ORANGE RIGHT IF IT STAYS ORANGE. WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE ONE FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE AND SIX MONTHS. WITH THAT PROVIDE SOME ASSURANCE TO A MEETING PLANNER THAT OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT WILL GO AHEAD YOU KNOW WE'RE OKAY WITH I MEAN. THIS IS THIS IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WOULD DEFINITELY HELP. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS STILL ON THE BOOKS FOR TO THE SECOND HALF OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. OKAY ASKING US RIGHT NOW WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL IN CALIFORNIA OKAY WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM OR GIVE HER ANY SORT OF. A FIRM- NATURE LIKE THAT THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH THEM OKAY SAID SO BASICALLY WE CAN GET A PROTOCOL FROM. THE GET NOW FROM BASICALLY CDPH OUR STATE THAT SAYS A LOT THERE WILL BE A THERE'S A PROTOCOL TO SAY THAT IF. YOU WERE AT A CERTAIN STATE. WE WILL ALLOW. THAT TO. THEN THAT WHAT WE BE YOU NEED TO PROVIDE ASSURANCES PLANNERS NOT TO CANCEL OR EVEN TO SCHEDULE. THAT WOULD RATHER MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL YES OKAY CAN SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA. ARE YOU ORANGE KNOWN FOR YOU KNOW. TWO MONTHS OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE YEAH WE CAN TELL OUR PLAN IS THAT THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. WHAT WE HAVE ARE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARRIVING ON ASSEMBLYMEMBER RICHARD BLOOM. I THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE FLIGHT OUT HERE AND- WE ARE IN OUR SECOND PANELIST ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OF THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I THINK THE MORE WE- YOU KNOW KIND OF WILL TO LIST DOWN WILL BE ABLE TO LEAVE HERE WITH SOME. VERY SPECIFIC ASK BUT I WOULD I WOULD SAY ON THE WHAT. ARDS TO- WHAT'S CENTER PANELISTS SAME. I KNOW MY DAUGHTERS ARE THIRTY AND THIRTY ONE AND ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS ARE PLANNING A WEDDING AND HAD PLANNED WEDDING SO THEY HAD TO PUT HIM OFF. AND THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE VENUE- MAYBE TO POSSIBLY RESCHEDULE A YEAR LATER HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE AND THEN DECIDING TO EITHER. CONTINUE WITH THE VENUE OR EVEN THE WEDDING- IT BUT- IT IS DIFFICULT IF YOU'RE THE VENUE TO KEEP SAYING OKAY WE'VE EXTENDED IT FOR A YEAR. NOW WILL DO ANOTHER YEAR SO I THINK SOME CONSISTENCY IS GOING TO MEAN A LOT TO- THE OPERATORS OF WHETHER IT'S A HOTEL OR VENUE OR SO FORTH. OKAY SO THEY WERE GOING TO CALL UP AND NEXT WE'RE GOING TO CALL UP- DAN HARVEY WHO'S THE VICE PRESIDENT OF HERTZ CORPORATION. WE WELCOME HIM. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO COME. ET TODAY- WHAT I'LL BE REPRESENTED THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY AND I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS ARE FROM A NATIONAL LEVEL AS WELL AS KIND OF BRING IT AT HOME. SPECIFICALLY THE CALIFORNIA. BUT I'M REALLY HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY AND GENERALLY ALSO ABOUT THE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HERTZ. SO I'VE WORKED FOR HERTZ FOR MORE THAN TWENTY THREE YEARS. JUST OVER HALF OF THAT HAS BEEN RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO- YOU KNOW LONG CAREER. WITH A COMPANY THAT IS- WE JUST CELEBRATED TWO YEARS AGO OUR HUNDRED YEAR ANNIVERSARY. I'M REALLY AN UNBLEMISHED. TIME PERIOD WITH OUR COMPANY WHERE WE'VE NEVER BEEN- IN THE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES SUCH AS WE ARE TODAY. PURCHASE ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC COMPANIES OUT THERE- WE HAVE- WERE A FORTUNE FIVE COMPANY WITH ALMOST TEN THOUSAND LOCATIONS IN A HUNDRED FIFTY COUNTRIES. AND WE ALSO OWN THE BRANDS FOR DOLLAR RENTAL CAR AND THRIFTY RENTAL CAR SO WE'RE ABOUT 35% OF THE pINDUSTRY ROUGHLY. HERS IS ALSO YOU KNOW WE TAKE OUR CUSTOMER SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY WHERE THE CURRENT- JD POWER NUMBER ONE IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION HOLDER WE JUST LEARNED THIS MORNING THAT. WILL RETAIN THAT FOR ANOTHER YEAR. IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US SO WHEN THIS PANDEMIC STRUCK IN HIT OUR COMPANY. BESIDES THE- THE FINANCIAL IMPACT WE KNEW THAT WE HAD A COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE A SAFE. INJURY FOR PEOPLE TRAVELING IN THE CALIFORNIA. IN THE END GETTING INTO SOMETHING THAT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT NERVE WRACKING FOR THEM INTO A RENTAL CAR SO WHEN THIS PANDEMIC IT WE- YOU KNOW WE WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH OFFICIALS. WE ENHANCED ALREADY ROBUST CLEANING PROTOCOLS TO MEET HEALTH CHALLENGES- IN THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CONSUMERS. WE CREATED A NEW PROGRAM CALLED% THE GOLD SEAL STANDARD WHICH BASICALLY MAKES IT SO THAT PEOPLE FEEL LIKE. THEY'RE THEY'RE ENTERING INTO A STAR RENTAL CAR. THAT HAS BEEN CLEANED. YOU KNOW ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS FROM THE TIME THAT THE CAR RETURNS AND THEN EVEN WHEN THE LAST PERSON THE PARKS THE CAR LEAVES- AND THEY- RESTORE LIES EVERYTHING THAT THEY OF TOUCH. AND THEN SET THAT UP FOR THE NEXT CUSTOMER. OUR COMPETITORS ALL TOOK SIMILAR ACTION SO THIS WASN'T JUST- WITHIN HERDS- BUT IT ONE TRAVEL STOP IN THE EARLY SPRING- WE WERE REALLY HIT WITH A DOUBLE WHAMMY. I MEAN. NUMBER ONE AIR TRAVEL IS HUGE FOR OUR BUSINESS I MEAN. IT'S NO MYSTERY THAT. YOU KNOW MOST OF THE BUSINESS AT THE AIRPORT RAIL CARS COMPANIES BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LOCATED IS FROM PASSENGERSTHAT ARE DEPARTING. DEPARTING AIRPLANES. SO WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND 80% OF THE FLIGHTS ROUGHLY. STOP FLYING IN. NOT ONLY DID WE HAVE. THE CHALLENGE OF NOT HAVING REVENUE IN THE CARS GOING BACK OUT BUT EVERYBODY WAS RETURNING THEIR VEHICLES. AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAD SIXTY SIX THOUSAND CARS THAT WE NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO PARK IN OUR FACILITIES WE USUALLY RUN ABOUT HAVE THE PROPERTY FOR THAT SO UNDER THE SCRAMBLE WE CREATE A LOT OF LEASES WITH PROPERTIES ALL OF THIS IS THAT ADDITIONAL COST SO. NOW REVENUES NOT FLOWING IN. AND WE HAVE A COST BURDEN THAT WE HAVE NEVER ANTICIPATED- THAT WAS IN THE MILLIONS. NOT TO MENTION THAT THE LACK OF TRAVEL AND REVENUE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER FOR US AND PUBLICLY- DOUBLED IT WAS THAT WE WHAT WE SUFFERED A LOSS OF 82% AND TOTAL REVENUE. MEANWHILE YOU KNOW OUR OUR LEASES STILL CAME DO. THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS THAT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY RELIEF FOR THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE. HAVE SUSPENDED DISCUSSIONS FOR RELIEF AND TELL. AFTER THE ELECTION BUT THE RESULT IDUSTRY WIDE HAS BEEN THE LOSSES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THE LOSS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS WITHIN OUR COUNTRY ACROSS THE NATION AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN CALIFORNIA THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY YOU KNOW HAS MADE A SLOW RECOVERY SINCE THE APRIL THOSE DIVE. AT SOME OF THE FLIGHTS HAVE RESUMED. AND HAS BEEN AIDED SOMEWHAT BY OUR LOCAL TRAFFIC- IN THE SUMMER DEMAND FOR ROAD TRIPS A LOT OF OUR BUSINESS TODAY THAT IS RESUMING BACK ARE FROM CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THAT ARE JUST TRYING TO GET OUT AND DO SOMETHING. BUT WE'RE STILL DOWN IN TOTAL REVENUE MORE THAN 50% PER YEAR. NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HURTS AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE STORY FOR US IS THAT IS THAT ESPECIALLY DEVASTATING I MENTION THE WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. BUT WHEN THIS HAPPENED WE HAD TO REALLY WE'RE REALLY FORCE WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION THE FIRST IN THE TOUGHEST DECISION. WAS THE ONE THAT IMPACTED THE LIVELIHOOD OF OUR DEDICATED WORK FORCE. AND THE OTHER CAME FROM FILING CHAPTER ELEVEN BACK IN MAY. AFTER AFTER A HUNDRED TWO YEARS. WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REDUCE THE LABOR. IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE REST OF THE U. S. BY MORE THAN 70% INITIALLY WITH A MIX OF FURLOUGHS AND THEN REALLY TURNED INTO- LAYOFFS. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA WE STILL HAVE HALF OF OUR AIRPORT OPERATION PLEASE- STILL IN THE LAST STATUS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE UNABLE TO BRING THEM BACK. SO AS WE SLOWLY RISE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE OF THE ECONOMIC HER. IT IS AN INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY SPEAKING FOR HERTZ WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON CREATING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. FOR OUR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE EMPLOYEES IN CUFFS CUSTOMERS TO MAKE. PEOPLE FEEL LIKE TRAVELING IS SAFE AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DO IS YOU SEEN AT SOME OF THE- MARKETING THAT YOU SEEN EARLIER TODAY. IN ADDITION THE CLEANING PROCESS OF THE PRODUCT WE HAVE- YOU KNOW UNPRECEDENTED PROTOCOLS IN OUR FACILITIES WE IMPLEMENTED A COMPANY WIDE MASS POLICY FOR NOT ONLY OUR EMPLOYEES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. THAT WAS A NATIONAL POLICY NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA- PHYSICAL DISTANCE HE'S MEASURES. IN OUR LOBBIES AS YOU CAN IMAGINE- WE HAVE BUSES TO TRANSPORT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE AIRPORT AND- ENSURING THAT THOSE PHYSICAL DISTANCING- POLICIES ARE ARE IN PLACES DIFFICULT WHEN. YOU'RE TRYING TO STOP TRAFFIC AND PEOPLE LOADING ON THE BUSES. BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE O WORK THROUGH THAT WE'VE CONSTRUCTED BARRIERS FOR EMPLOYEES TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. BOTH IN OUR FACILITIES AND OUR BUSES. SO WE'RE CREATING THAT SAFE SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND WE FEEL THAT WE CAN WE CAN INCREASE THAT WITH VOLUME- WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY THE PURPOSE BEHIND IT AND MAKING EVERYONE FEEL SAFE. NOW TO ANSWER SOME OF THE UPCOMING- QUESTIONS BY ASSEMBLYMAN CHILL YOU KNOW KNOWING THAT THE STATE FACES UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET DEFICITS THIS COMING YEAR HURTS IS NOT HERE TO ASK FOR GENERAL FUND SO. THEY CAN BETTER BE UTILIZED BY EDUCATION HEALTHCARE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. WITH THE CAR INDUSTRY THE CAR RENTAL INDUSTRY COULD USE- AND THE HELP. AND WHAT WOULD HELP COMPANIES LIKE HERTZ RETURN TO PROFITABILITY AND TO GENERATE REVENUES FOR ENTITIES LIKE VISIT CALIFORNIA. AS FOR LEGISLATURE TO ELIMINATE DECADES OLD PRICING CONTROLS THE PASSAGE LEGISLATORS HAVE IMPOSED ON THE CAR RENTAL INDUSTRY FOR ELEVEN COLLISION DAMAGE WAIVER THIS IS. A SERVICE THAT WE IT'S AN INSURANCE- WAIVER THAT WE SELL TO OUR CUSTOMERS- AND ALSO THE ABILITY TO CHARGE FOR ADDITIONAL DRIVERS. THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE VERY UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA- THEY'RE NOT- IN MOST OTHER STATES. AND READ RELIEVING THESE REGULATIONS WILL HELP US SO THAT WE CAN HELP THE STATE TREASURY. AND HELP TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT ADEQUATE FUNDING TO VISIT CALIFORNIA. SO THOSE ARE TWO THINGS SPECIFIC TO OUR INDUSTRY THE PROBABLY THE THIRD AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT. OVERALL IS A SIMILAR MESSAGE THAT YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY TODAY AND THAT'S THE CONSISTENCY IN THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE MESSAGING. AND WHAT PEOPLE CAN AND CANNOT DO AND WHAT THE WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT THE CURRENT SITUATION IS TODAY- FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY COMES IN AND THEY WANT TO TAKE A ROAD TRIP TO GO CAMPING IT'S VERY UNCLEAR. WHERE THEY CAN GO. THERE THEIR CAMPING IS AVAILABLE IN SOME COUNTIES AND THEN YOU GO ACROSS TO ANOTHER AND IT'S NOT WITHIN EVEN THOSE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES MAYBE A STATE PARK THAT HAVE CAMPGROUNDS MAY BE CLOSED. WELL JUST DON'T KNOW AND SO A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE JUST GOING OUT AND DEALING WITH WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. FOR PEOPLE TO WANT TO TAKE THOSE TRIPS IF THEY DON'T. HAVE THE CERTAINTY OF WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO FACE WHEN WE'RE OUT THERE. YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE. OR YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE WITH THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRYPROVIDES. THERE'S A CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST REVENUE SEGMENT. THROUGH THE ASSESSMENTS WRITTEN IN THE BY DECLINE IN THE REVENUE THIS DRASTIC IT'S A SERIOUS BLOW TO OUR BUDGET WHICH HELPS TO PROVIDE FOR THE MARKETING IN AWARENESS DELIVERED THROUGH VISIT CALIFORNIA. THAT IS PROVEN TO BE SO VITAL IN THE PAST FOR US. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING IN OUR RECOVERY IN A PROSPEROUS PROP PROSPEROUS WAY IN A SAFE WAY THAT WE TOLD YOU WE WILL LIVE UP TO OUR COMMITMENT. TO ENSURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE GET OFF THE AIRPLANE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET TO THEIR DESTINATIONS IN A SAFE WAY. AND THAT'S REALLY THE MESSAGE I WANTED TO GET ACROSS. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER HARVEY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM DO YOU HAVE ANY REMARKS OR QUESTIONS JUST BECAUSE- THIS. I'M JUST GLAD TO BE HERE- TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE TO I ACTUALLY HAVE PROBABLY UP MORE THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR UP AND TRAVELING GOOD- ON- ON AIRPLANES ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT- IT'S MOSTLY SOUTHWEST AND IT'S- EVERY FLIGHT HAS BEEN ON TIME- AND GREAT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A MIDDLE SEAT AVAILABLE AND- A GREAT COMPLIANCE WITH- MASKING RICK MASKING REQUIREMENTS IN A- I THINK A- FAIR AMOUNT OF COMFORT. TO AMONGST MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND THEN OVER THE WEEKEND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RENT A CAR AND I HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE WITH ONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS TO ENSURE VERY SIMILAR TO- OF THE SERVICE THAT THAT HURTS IS PROVIDING AND I. THINK GOING FORWARD THAT. THAT OF US STELLAR SERVICE I SHOULD SAY THIS WAS THE FIRST FLIGHT ON SOUTHWEST THAT ACTUALLY GOT CANCELED BECAUSE IT WAS A MECHANICAL PROBLEM AND THAT'S WHY I. WAS LATE I HAD TO SWITCH OVER. TO ANOTHER FLIGHT BUT I THINK THAT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE. THAT PROVIDES A LEVEL OF COMFORT- FOR- PATRONS OF THE- OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND PARTICULARLY THE HIGH. COMMUNITY IS GOING TO BE KEY TO COMING BACK- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FROM THE- PANDEMIC AND TO BEING ABLE TO. BEGIN TO OFFSET THE TERRIBLE ECONOMIC- COSTS THAT WE'VE WE'VE SUFFERED- AND I'M QUITE CERTAIN THAT- THAT'S GOING TO BE THE KEY TO. A DOMESTIC TRAVEL AND A RETURN TO NORMALCY- AND DOUBLY CERTAIN THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE TRUE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL IN. BOTH OF THESE ARE- OF FUNDAMENTALS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND TO IN PARTICULAR THE ECONOMY OF A LOT OF FUN- OF THOSE WHO ARE SITTING HERE ON THE- ON THE DICE TODAY AND PARTICIPATE IN THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE. I DID HAVE- BUT WANTED TO ASK- CUT YOU MISTER HARVEY ONE NOT A FOR ONE CLARIFICATION I MAY HAVE MISSED IT BUT- THE ISSUE WITH THE CAMPGROUNDS WHAT IS THAT- HAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SPECIFICALLY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. DID THE SOME TYPE OF A WAY FOR. PEOPLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN THE COUNTIES WITHOUT HAVING TO YOU KNOW CALL EACH COUNTY AHEAD OF TIME READ THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS THAT WILL TELL THEM WHAT THE RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE. I MEAN IT REALLY COULD IT STARTS WITH CONSISTENCY IF THERE WASN'T STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY. THEN THAT WOULD BE EASY RIGHT BECAUSE THEN- EVERYBODY WOULD KNOW PRETTY MUCH WHAT'S GOING ON EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT WE HAVE THE INCONSISTENCIES WITHIN THE COUNTIES. WE KNOW THAT WITH THE COUNTY IS BEING ABLE. TO BE. WHETHER OR NOT IT INTO WHAT PACE THEY'RE GOING TO OPEN THAT CAUSES A LOT OF CONFUSION SO IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT IF IT WAS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT BY BY COUNTIES. SOME WAY THAT EACH COUNTY HAS A STANDARD YOU KNOW SOME TYPE OF A STANDARD VIEW DOCUMENT THAT SAYS WHAT THE STATUS OF THE- COUNTY IS IN WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT. AVAILABLE TO DO WITHOUT REALLY HAVING TO READ THROUGH YOU KNOW THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LAST ORDER. OKAY THANK YOU LET ME GIVE THAT SOME THOUGHT. AT I THINK THAT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE ON THE CONSISTENCY THAT- FOR EXAMPLE MASK YOU HAVE SOME CITIES THAT MADE A MASK ORDINANCE SOME COUNTIES THAT HAVE MADE AMOUNT MASSPORT ANTS OR ARE NOT IN ALLIANCE EVEN WITH. THE CITY IN THEIR AREA AND THEN YOU HAVE THE STATE SO IT IS VERY CONFUSING. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE AND ICE I THINK THAT WORD THAT KEEPS COMING UP CONSISTENCY WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR- MANY PEOPLE JUST TO KNOW WHEN I'M OUT I'M DOING THIS OR SO FORTH YEAH MADAM CHAIR EVEN FOR AN EXAMPLE THAT YOU JUST THAT THE DAY YOU REALLY MADE ME THINK OF IS THAT YOU KNOW ONE WEEK WHEN HE CAME OUT AS A COMPANY WITH. A NATIONAL MASS POLICY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR OUR EMPLOYEES- PART OF WHAT WAS DRIVING THAT OF COURSE SAFETY IS A BIG FACTOR OF IT BUT ALSO BECAUSE SOME STATES REQUIRED IN SOME STATES DON'T REQUIRE IT. OUR EMPLOYEES WERE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME ENFORCING IT BECAUSE THE TRAVELERS DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE GOING WHAT WAS WHAT WAS THE EXPECTATION THERE. SOMEONE WE WERE ABLE TO PUT A BLANKET STATEMENT ON OUR COMPANY WEBSITE THAT SHOWED OR FROM THE PHONE OR WHAT HAVE YOU RESERVE YOUR CAR THAT SAID. THIS IS NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO IT HURTS THIS IS WHAT OUR POLICY IS THAT GREATLY REDUCED OUR EMPLOYEES WERE VERY THANKFUL THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE SITUATIONS BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE WERE COMPLIANT BECAUSE. THEY KNEW WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE AHEAD OF TIME. SENATE PAN. THANK YOU THINK. SO IT. WE DO HAVE A STATEWIDE MASK OR BUT I KNOW THAT WE CHANNEL AS WORKING WITH THE VERY YOU KNOW THE C. P. C. PH N. CHEERING FROM DIFFERENT COUNT HEALTH. OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW IT THIS DOES CHANGE INTO ACCOUNT THE IS A BIG RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS. WHAT A. AND SAN DIEGO MAYBE BRADY ONE HALF UP IN CHEST. ABOUT THE- FROM SACRAMENTO TO THE BAY AREA CELLS. I GUESS ONE JUST CLARIFICATION- IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE COULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO TRAVELERS THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THE- THIS EARLY THE MOST RECENT I CAN MUSTER STICK IT'S NOT QUITE THE RIGHT WORD BUT- BUT IN TERMS OF IT IS IT THAT. AND THEN HAVE IT'S POSSIBLE TO REGION MAY BE LESS RESTRICTIVE THAT THEY'RE TRAVELING AND IF THEY'RE GOOD. DOES THAT HELP THE ARE ANY I GUESS THE PROBLEM I GUESS. I GET IT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I ALSO THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU KNOW YOUR CALIFORNIA. WE GENERALLY HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL CONTROL- THAT'S- AND IT'S NOT JUST IN. PUBLIC HEALTH WITH A WHOLE LAYER OF DIFFERENT THINGS AS WELL A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS AS WELL SO- IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW STOP FLIES ACROSS THE STATE- THERE ARE FEW THINGS IS THAT LIKE A MASK OR IT COULD TRY TO PLAY ACROSS THE STATE THERE MAY BE VARIATIONS ENFORCEMENT DEPENDING ON THE LOCALITY BUT- AND TERMS OF- GUIDANCE TO TRAVELERS WHO ARE COMING LET'S SAY TO CALIFORNIA WANT TO TRAVEL- IT IS. IS THERE YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING LIKE. PEOPLE JUST TO CONFUSE AND THEREFORE THEY WANT TO COME. WE CAN PROVIDE SOME LIGHT. GUIDANCE TO THEM. YEAH EVEN IF IT'S MORE COLD RESTRICTIVE THAN MAY. BE HAPPENING THE COUNTY THAT WOULD. ACTUALLY BE BETTER. YES AND SO CURRENTLYI'M MOST OF THE TRI THAT WERE CATERING. YEAH TODAY LOCAL PEOPLE ARE LOCAL TO ANY RIGHT SO THE- EVEN. WITHIN RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA SO JUST NOT KNOWING WHERE TO GO SO. UNDERSTANDING THAT. NOT ANYTIME SOON ARE WE GOING TO CHANGE IT TO WHERE THE GOVERNMENT OR THE WORK TO WHERE THE STATE POLICY. OVER RULES THE COUNTY POLICY TO WHERE EVERYBODY'S DOING THE SAME THING IF THERE WAS SOME TYPE OF A CONSIDER MAYBE HAVE LIKE THAT THE TOP TEN THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY'RE GOING. ON A ROAD TRIP- ON A TRAVELING TRIP OR WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO GO. WHETHER IT'S- THE STATUS OF THE HOTELS THE STATUS OF THE RESTAURANTS WHETHER OR NOT IF THEY'RE ABLE TO HAVE INDOOR DINING OR OUTDOOR DINING. THAT A CHECKLIST WILL ACT CAMPING TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BECAUSE I BROUGHT THAT UP EARLIER. THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME TYPE OF A STANDARD DOCUMENT WERE OR PLACE THAT YOU COULD GO AND JUST LOOK AT. EACH COUNTIES- EACH COUNTIES CURRENT GUIDELINES AND WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWING THAT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO SEE. YOU KNOW ONE WHERE WHERE CAN WE GO IF WE'RE LOOKING TO DO X.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOT WILL CALL UP THEN- LISA ALLEN WHOSE OPERATION MANAGERS OF TOURIST SALES IN CALIFORNIA TOURISM. WITH AMADOR STAGE LINES. WELCOME LISA HI THERE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND VERY NICE THAT WE CAN ALL GET TOGETHER AND DO THIS MY NAME IS LISA ALLEN AND I'M THE OPERATIONS MANAGER MY FAMILY MOTOR COACH BUSINESS AMADOR STAGE FIND HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IT'S AN HONOR TO REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATION THE MOTOR COACH COMPANIES TO MAKE UP THE GROUND TRANSPORTATION INTENT OF CALIFORNIA TOURISM. MANY DON'T KNOW THAT OF HOW MOTOR COACH COMPANIES FAMILY AND OPERATED. AMADOR SAVE FINDS THE SOUND IN AN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO AS A STAGE COACH COMPANY. KERRY MINORS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA TO THE GOLD COUNTRY. MY GRANDPARENTS STARTED A CHARTER IN SCHOOL BUS SERVICE IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN. AND THEN PURCHASE AMADOR IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX. AND THE WHEELS HAVE BEEN ROLLING EVER SINCE OR SHOULD I SAY UNTIL NOW. PEOPLE ASK HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE BEST BUSINESS. I AND I USED TO LIVE IN A WOMB TO TOMB. MY PARENTS MET AT A MOTOR COACH CONVENTION AND I'VE BEEN SURROUNDED BY THE BUS WORLD EVER SINCE I WAS BORN. NOW INSTEAD OF ONE TO TWO. I WORRIED IT'S WILLING TO YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. CURRENTLY THE CHARTER BUS INDUSTRIES BUSINESS HAS COME TO A COMPLETE HALT. WE WENT FROM NINETY MOVES A DAY TO TWO. AND THOSE TWO ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALL CONTRACT MOVE FOR THE MILITARY HERE LOCALLY IN SACRAMENTO. IN FACT ANOTHER CALIFORNIA BUS COMPANY MOVE TROOPS TO THE U. S. MERCY AND LONG BEACH ONE CALLED IN MARCH. WHEN COVERT HEAD AND THE GOVERNOR DECLARED AN EMERGENCY WE STARTED GETTING CANCELLATION AFTER CANCELLATION. FOR TRIPS FROM MARCH UNTIL PRESENT DAY. WE REFUNDED ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS PREPAYMENT. ALTHOUGH THE CHARTER TO STOP COMING IN THIRD STILL BILLS THAT NEED TO BE PAID FOR. OUR BUSINESSES HAVE LOAN PAYMENTS ON NEW CARB COMPLIANT BUSES. IN FACT WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST COMPANIES TO COVER OUR FLEET BEFORE THE CORPORALS WERE IN PLACE. WE HAVE BEEN WE HAVE BUILDING PAYMENTS INSURANCE PAYMENTS HEALTHCARE PAYMENTS. DMV REGISTRATION PAYMENTS AND MORE. SPEAKING OF DMV REGISTRATION PAYMENTS. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND AND BASS REGISTRATION FEES FOR VEHICLES AND NOT BE ABLE TO USE THEM. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND INR BUSTER SITTING IN OUR YARD. OUR STORY IS THE SAME STORY IN A DIFFERENT VERSION FOR ALL CALIFORNIA BUS ASSOCIATIONS. OVERALL THIS IS A FAIRNESS ISSUE WE ARE COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AS A BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNOR STAY HOME ORDER. NOW OUR INDUSTRY IS SIMPLY ASKING FOR A CREDIT. OF OUR DMV REGISTRATION FEES FOR TWENTY. THAT WE CAN USE TOWARDS TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT'S NOT FAIR TO CHARGE COMPANIES THESE DMV REGISTRATION FEES IF WE REALLY CAN OPERATE AND TELL THE GOVERNOR DECLARES THIS PHASE FOR. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL BE HERE OUR DMV RENEWAL OF REGISTRATION FEES WILL BE DUE. FOR MANY COMPANIES THIS WILL BE THE STRAW THE BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK THERE'S NO INCOME EVERYTHING EACH FAMILY BUSINESS HAS FOUGHT FOR COULD BE THROWN OUT THE WINDOW IN A BLINK OF AN EYE. TODAY WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA TALK ABOUT OUR WONDERFUL TOUR THE MARKET. FROM THE BEACHES TO THE REDWOODS. TO THE MANY WINE COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE STATE EVERYONE CAN FIND SOMETHING THEY CAN ENJOY IN CALIFORNIA. DURING THIS TIME TOURISM HAS COME TO AN END. SO BUSES HAVE COME TO AN END. IN THE PAST WHO DO FORTY TRIPS TO DISNEYLAND PER WEEKEND IN MAY FOR GRAD NIGHTS. WE WOULD DO WINE COUNTRY TRIPS WEDDINGS YOU SOMEBODY TRIPS CULTURAL TRIPS YOU NAME IT WE WERE OUT THERE. WITHOUT HEALTH IS PREDICTED THAT 8290% OF US COMPANIES WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS. WHO WILL MOVE CALIFORNIA TOURIST ALL OF OUR WONDERFUL SPOTS. WE WENT FROM A HUNDRED AND TEN EMPLOYEES TO CURRENTLY TEN EMPLOYEES. INSTEAD OF KEEPING EMPLOYEES ON FURLOUGH WE RECENTLY HADTO LET MANY EMPLOYEES GO THAT I WORKED FIRST FOR TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS. THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST EMPLOYEES. THEIR FAMILY. THEY HAVE WATCH MY FAMILY GROW AND WE'VE WATCHED THEIR- TO THINK WE HAVE THE TO LET THEM GO WAS DEVASTATING. BUT IT'S REALLY THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SURVIVE. WE ARE NOT ALONE. BEFORE COLBERT HIT THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED BY MOTOR COACH COMPANIES. NATIONWIDE FROM DRIVERS OFFICE STAFF MECHANICS AND SO N. IN THE RECENT WEEKS THREE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND HAVE BEEN LAID OFF OR FURLOUGHED. THIS NEWS IT'S HARD TO HEAR IT NOT ONLY HURTS US. AS A WHOLE. BUT OUR EXTENDED FAMILIES AND THE ECONOMY. THE MOTOR COACH INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE IS ON THE BRINK OF NO RETURN. WITHOUT ANY HELP MANY COMPANIES WILL NO LONGER BE IN BUSINESS. WHO WILL BRING THE GROUPS INTO THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM WHO WILL TAKE OURIST THIRTY. FOR A DAY OF SHOPPING AND FUN. THE US MOTOR COACH INDUSTRY PROVIDES NEARLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION PASSENGER TRIPS PER YEAR. THEIR LIVES PROVIDE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOMESTIC TRIPS PER PER YEAR. SO WE'RE VERY CLOSE THE PASSENGER TRAVEL. THEY RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE BILLION AND WE'VE RECEIVED ZERO. THE MOTOR COACH INDUSTRIES TAKEN FOR GRANTED BUT WE'RE THERE TO TAKE YOUR CHILD TO THEIR FIRST OVERNIGHT FIELD TRIP FOR THEIR TO GET THOUSANDS OUT OF A NATURAL DISASTER OUT OF FIRES AND SO ON. WERE THERE FOR YOUR BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING WHERE THERE IS A DESIGNATED DRIVER OUT ON THE TOWN. WHERE THERE TO TAKE FIFTY FIVE CARS OFF THE ROAD AT A CERTAIN TIME. TO HELP BETTER THE AIR QUALITY AND DO OUR PART TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. PLUS PLUS MUCH MORE. AS A WHOLE THE MOTOR COACH INDUSTRY BRINGS IN TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BILLION AND TOURISM AND JOBS NATIONWIDE. WITHOUT US THERE WILL BE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE OVERALL ECONOMY. WE ALWAYS WE ARE ALWAYS HERE TO HELP NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP. WE NEED YOUR HELP AND YOUR VOICES WE HOPE THAT WE CAN RECEIVE A CREDIT FOR A DMV REGISTRATION FEES FOR THE NEXT YEAR. IF THIS BURDEN IS LIFTED IT THERE'S STILL HOPE COMPANIES CAN STAY AFLOAT. WE WANT TO BE THERE WHEN YOU CALL WE WANT TO BE THERE FOR THE GOOD TIMES WE WANT TO BE THERE IN THE NEXT NECESSARY MOMENTS OF SURVIVAL. I WANT MY CHILDREN TO HAVE THE JOY OF SHARING THEIR MOTOR COACH INDUSTRIES STORIES AND TO BE PROUD OF CONTINUING A LEGACY. I KNOW I SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS TODAY WE LOVE WHAT WE DO AND WE DO IT FOR THE PEOPLE. THE MOTOR COACH INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE SAVED AND WE NEED YOUR HELP. OUR SLOGAN IS WE'RE GOING PLACES. I HOPE WE AND OTHERS CAN CONTINUE THAT SLOGAN FOR MANY MANY MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. I HOPE I MADE IMPACT ON HOW IMPORTANT THE MOTOR COACH INDUSTRY NOT ONLY IS TO MYSELF. BUT CALIFORNIA OUR ECONOMY. OUR EMPLOYEES. TOURISM AND BUSINESS OWNERS. LET'S NOT LOOK BACK AND SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT TILL IT'S GONE. LET'S MAKE A DIFFERENCE TODAY AND KEEP OUR MOTOR COACH INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND TO. YOUR POINTS REALLY QUICK- I THINK I COVERED IT MULTIPLE TIMES IN HERE BUT THE DMV REGISTRATION FEES IT'S- IT'S HUGE I MEAN OUR BUSES ARE PARKEDWE'VE DONE ONE TRIP SINCE MARCH SEVENTEENTH. SO BASICALLY PAID A HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND TO LICENSE OUR BUSES AND WE'VE DONE ONE TRIP SO IT IT'S HUGE AND THAT'S NOT ONLY US BUT- A- FIVE BUS COMPANY A TWENTY BUS COMPANY. WHETHER IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND A HUNDRED THOUSAND A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IT'S A HUGE IMPACT ON. ON ON US PEOPLE CANNOT STAY IN BUSINESS- AND THEN THE CAR RULE THERE'S A COMPANY IN SAN FRANCISCO HOP ON TOURS IT'S A DOUBLE DECKER BUS HE CALLED ME YESTERDAY. AND HE ASKED IF I COULD MENTION THE CARPOOL HE JUST PURCHASED. MULTIPLE BUSES FOR HIS COMPANY. AND HE HAS WHAT GOOD FOR FIVE YEARS TO USE THEM BECAUSE THE MISSION'S ROLE OF COURSE. SO I ST WE CAN'T USE THEM FOR ONE TO TWO YEARS HE WAS HOPING TO USE OF FORTY FIVE YEARS BUT NOW HE'S OUT PROBABLY ONE TO TWO YEARS OF USE OF THE BUSES. SO IT SUCKS THOSE ARE VERY SPECIFIC REQUESTED I THINK THEY'RE ON VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT. COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WE CAN. DO OUR BEST BUT- ONE IT'S VERY SPECIFIC LIKE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN. MAKE A CASE FOR IT SO WE APPRECIATE IT WE ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR STORY VERY COMPELLING THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT- THAT IS GOING TO TAKE US TO PART THREE OF OUR HEARING. AND A LOT OF INFORMATION HERE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HEAR THIS FIRST HAND SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE TO PART THREE HOW CAN CALIFORNIA'S TOURISM INDUSTRY RECOVER- WE HAVE AARON GUERRERO WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA'S. ATTRACTIONS AND PARKS ASSOCIATION. WELCOME ERIN HI HUGH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AND GROW ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONS AND PARKS ASSOCIATION. FIRST OFF WE WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON YOUR APPOINTMENT TO THIS IMPORTANT POSITION AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE MANY ISSUES WE WILL BE FACING OVER NEXT NEXT MANY YEARS. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S THEME PARKS LARGE AND SMALL WE REALLY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE DIRE IMPACT- BUT NINETEEN IN THE MANDATED CLOSURES HAVE HAD ON OUR INDUSTRY AND OUR WORK FORCE AS WELL AS ON THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND HOW WE CAN BEGIN TO RECOVER. YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT TOURISM IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S THEME PARKS. THESE ICONIC PARKS ARE A SIGNATURE INDUSTRY FOR OUR STATE. AND THEY- INSTANTLY CONJURE IMAGES OF MICKEY MOUSE. WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH- WITH THE BEAUTIFUL FERRIS WHEEL AT THE END OF SANTA MONICA PIER ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLUMAS DISTRICT AND THE KNOTT'S BERRY FARM'S BOYSENBERRY FESTIVAL ONE OF TINA'S FAVORITES. AND A AND GHOST TOWN WHICH IS ALSO IN YOUR DISTRICT. THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EVERYBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA'S VIBRANT THEME PARKS. AND THEY ARE ONE OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF CALIFORNIA'S FORMERLY VIBRANT TOURISM INDUSTRY. AND I KNOW THE SEGMENT IS ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA'S TOURISM INDUSTRY CAN RECOVER BUT I THINK WE ARE UNIQUE BECAUSE WE ARE. CLOSED SO ARE MESSAGES THAT THE FIRST STEP FOR GETTING AMUSEMENT PARKS OUT OF THIS HOLE. IS TO STOP DIGGING. FOR EACH DAY THAT GOES BY THAT A MUSEUM PARKS DON'T HAVE A PATHWAY TOWARD RESPONSIBLE RE OPENING ON A REALISTIC TIMELINE. THAT HOLE GETS DEEPER. AND JUST A BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THIS ALL EVOLVED BACK IN MARCH. THANKS VOLUNTARY COULD VOLUNTARILY CLOSE THEIR DOORS WE WANTED TO BE PARTNERS WITH THE STATE WE UNDERSTOOD THE GRAVE SITUATION OF COCA NINETEEN AND WE WANTED TO WORK TOGETHER IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY. ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO A DAY THAT WE COULD REOPEN. DURING THOSE SEVEN MONTHS WE'VE DEVELOPED COMPREHENSIVE PLANS THAT CONSIST OF REDUCE CAPACITY RIGOROUS SANITATION PROCEDURES EMPLOYED PROTOCOLS AND TRAINING GUESTS PROTOCOLS FACE COVERING REQUIREMENTS PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AND OVER THE SEVEN MONTHS THEY'VE REFINED OF THOSE PLANS IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED TO REOPEN IN A SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER AS SOON AS WERE GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT MAKES PARKS UNIQUE- WHEN YOU GO TO VISIT A PARK. YOU SEE THE MAGIC YOU SEE THE FUN THAT'S KIND OF THE MYSTIQUE OF THESE PARKS THAT'S THEIR GOALS FOR YOU TO YOU KNOW FORGET YOUR WORRIES AND HAVE FUN. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE BEHIND THE SCENES SO YOU KNOW THESE ARE PRIMARILY OUTDOOR LOCATIONS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF OPEN SPACE. THEY'RE NOT TYPICALLY INTENDED FOR CONGREGATING OR MIXING IT'S A PLACE WHERE A FAMILY WILL GO TO ENJOY EACH OTHER'S COMPANY. AND NOT HUDDLE UP WITH WITH STRANGERS. THERE CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS UNLIKE MANY OTHER ACTIVITIES. THAT ARE ALREADY BEING ALLOWED IN THE STATE. THERE ARE AREAS WHERE YOU CAN'T ENFORCE MASKING PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY GAS OF THEME PARKS ARE USED TO THIS THEY KNOW THAT WHEN THEY GO TO A PARK. THEY'RE GONNA BE EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR BEHAVIOR SO THERE THERE ARE PERFECT EXAMPLES OF HOW. AN INDUSTRY CAN ENCOURAGE THE BEHAVIOR THAT WE NEED TO SEE TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE PANDEMIC. A PARKS ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF ME MOVING PEOPLE IT'S NOT STATIC THE CONTROL THE CAPACITY ON A REGULAR BASIS- EVEN PRE COATED. AND THEY PLACE A HIGH VALUE ON GUEST AND EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION- PARKS KNOW THAT THEY NEED A HEALTHY WORKFORCE. AND THAT THEY NEED CONSUMER CONFIDENCE THESE ARE CRITICAL IN THE LONG TERM IT DOES NOBODY ANY GOOD TO RE OPEN PREMATURELY IN AN UNSAFE WAY. WE KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR RE OPENING AND WE THINK THE TIME IS GETTING CLOSE I WON'T GO TOO. DEEP INTO THE IMPACTS ARE HEARING IT FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES BUT YOU KNOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LAID OFF AND FURLOUGHED. THESE PEOPLE ARE READY TO GET BACK TO WORK- ON THE- INDUSTRY SIDE WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT LOSING THAT TELL US PERMANENTLY. AND BEYOND THE PARKS YOU'VE GOT COMMUNITIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT DEPEND ON THE THEME PARK INDUSTRY. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WHO RELY ON THOSE TAX DOLLARS. AND I THINK. AS WE AS WE EXPLORE RE OPENING WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO KEEP THAT HELL AND FIGHTING THE PAN TOP OF MIND AND OUR MAIN MESSAGE FOR YOU IS THAT RESPONSIBLY REOPEN CALIFORNIA'S AMUSEMENT PARKS AND A STUBBORN COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING COATED AND TAKING A SCIENCE AND DATA AND HEALTH FIRST APPROACH. THESE ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THINGS YOU CANNOT DO BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY. AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN OTHER STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE SHOWING THAT PARKS ARE RE OPENING SO YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR PARKS HAVE FACILITIES. OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN MANY CASES THERE CALIFORNIA PARK IS THE ONLY PART THAT'S NOT REOPENED. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND WE'RE NOT SEEN THESE OUTBREAKS OF COVERT BEING TRACED BACK TO PARKS. ARE THERE IS A RECENT NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT AND IT HIGHLIGHTED THAT. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THE PEOPLE FEAR TO DISNEY WORLD. JUST ISN'T PLAYING OUT AND THEY SITE THAT HEALTH OFFICIALS AS WELL AS AN AS WORKER UNIONS. ARE CITING THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS THAT ARE IN PLACE AS RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING THE VIRUS THAT DAY. HERE IN THE STATE WE'VE GOT THE ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH AGENCY THAT IS RECOMMENDING. THAT THE PARTS OF THE RE OPENING TIER THREE. SO THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD SHOWING THAT THESE PARKS CAN WE OPEN IN A SAFE WAY. SO WHERE ARE WE NOW AGAIN OUR FIRST STEP IS TO PLOT OUT RESPONSIBLE AND REASONABLE RE OPENING PLANNED FOR THE PARKS WE DESPERATELY NEED THAT- I'M SURE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN READING THE PRESS IT'S BEEN HIGHLIGHTED PRETTY PRETTY WELL AND THAT THE GOVERNOR I NOW SENDING AND TEAMS OF FOLKS OUT TO THE VISIT THE PARKS CURRENTLY WE'RE EXTREMELY ENCOURAGED BY THIS PARKS ARE COMPLEX AND YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT FIRST HAND TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW THESE EXTENSIVE PLANS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN IN REAL IN REAL TIME.AND IT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHENPARKS REOPENED IT'S GOING TO LOOK DRAFT DIFFERENT THAN IT DID BEFORE COPELAND IT'S NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO PRE CODED YOU KNOW AS SOON AS THEY- GIVE US THE GREEN LIGHT. SO TO ANSWER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO THIS QUESTION- CAN'T LIMIT TO THREE SORRY. SO I THINK THEY'RE FIVE THINGS REALLY THAT THAT WE NEED. FIRST OF ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR FAIRNESS AGAIN I'M UPPER REPRESENTING AT AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR SEVEN MONTHS. WE LOOK AT SIMILARLY SITUATED INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO REOPEN. WE SEE OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NOT SIMILAR SIMILARLY SITUATED BUT- ACTUALLY POSSIBLY RISKIER THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO REOPEN SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME FAIRNESS AND TREATMENT- WITHIN THE BLUEPRINT. OF A REASONABLE TIME. WAITING UNTIL TIER FOUR TO RE OPEN PARKS WILL DECIMATE THE INDUSTRY I CANNOT I CANNOT STATE THAT MORE CLEARLY- THERE ARE NO CONSIST PROJECTIONS ABOUT WHEN THESE COUNTIES WITHIN PARKS WOULD HIT TIER FOUR WERE WORRIED ABOUT. THE TIER FOUR METRICS- ONE CASE FOR WHY HUNDRED RESIDENTS AND SOME OF THESE COUNTIES FALL SO POSITIVE THE LOAN COULD PUSH THEM OF THAT SO WE DON'T SEE TIER FOUR AS AS A RE OPENING PLAN WE SEE IT AS A IT WOULD BE A WAY TO KEEP PARKS CLOSED INDEFINITELY. NUMBER THREE. WE NEED REASONABLE GUIDELINES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT ANY CAPACITY OR GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATIONS MAKE SENSE. THAT THERE FEASIBLE AND PRACTICAL. AT FOURTH WE NEED AN ITERATIVE AND COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND I AM HOPING THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. WE HAVE WORLD WIDE EXPERIENCE AND WE'VE GOT BEST PRACTICES- THAT WE CAN DRAW FROM. WE WELCOME INVOLVEMENT BY THE HEALTH OFFICIALS AND WE WANT YOU TO WORK TOGETHER. NOPE THERE'S NEVER A PERFECT. SITUATION IN ANY REGARD RIGHT BUT WORKING TOGETHER CAN ALWAYS MAKE IT BETTER AND WE WILL EAGER TO DO THAT. AND THE FIFTH ONE IS. A MESSAGE TO THE STATE NOT ONE SIZE ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL- THE GOVERNOR'S OF KNOWLEDGE THAT THESE ARE COMPLEX. THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE CITIES AND- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PARKS ARE NOT HOMOGENEOUS THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT YOU'VE GOT SMALL PARTY GOT THE PARKS. AND WE NEED TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF- YOU KNOW DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PARKS. AND AS FAR AS OUR FUTURE GOES WHEN I THINK THERE'S A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THEIR DATA AND RESEARCH EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR PLANNING- YOU KNOW AS CAROLINE POINTED OUT WE WILL BE BACK. TO PRE COVERED LEVELS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. SO THE RECOVERY IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW VERY SLOW GOING OF COURSE WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO A VACCINE ADVANCED THERAPEUTICS. BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO RESTORE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN TRAVEL. BUT YOU KNOW IN THE NEAR TERM pRE OPEN AT ALL IN ORDER TO. LOOK TO THE FUTURE- YOU KNOW PARKS ARE ABOUT FUN THERE ABOUT HOPE. THEY'RE ABOUT CHOI. AND WE WANT TO GET BACK TO BEING ABLE TO PROVIDING THAT TO FAMILIES- WE AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU AND I LOOK FORWARDTO CONTINUING WORKING WITH YOU AS WE- TRY TO OPEN OUR DOORS AGAIN. THANK YOU I DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MR MILLER MISTER TO. I JUST ONCE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK AND MABE TO EVERYONE HERE. MY QUESTION AROUND SPECIFICS IF YOU WANT TO SEND US ANYTHING IN WRITING AFTER THIS HEARING- THE OPEN TO THAT I AM VERY VERY SORRY NO WITH THIS HEARING WAS SUPPOSED TO WRAP UP BUT FOR NOW I'M GONNA LEAVE IN A FEW MINUTES TO GET BACK. OF FOR A COUPLE OF EVENTS THAT I HAVE BUT I AM VERY EAGER TO HEAR MORE SPECIFICS AND- I DO HAVE STAFF WERE WATCHING THIS AND TAKING NOTES BUT TO REALLY APPRECIATING IT AND I'VE TO SAY- WHILE I FEEL CLOSE TO THE INDUSTRY. A LOT OF THESE VERY SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS ARE ALL NEW TO ME SO IT'S JUST AGAIN THIS IS WHY THIS YEAR AND SO HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO REALLY. EDUCATE US ON THIS AND GIVE US SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE CAN DO. THANK YOU FOR THE- THANK YOU I DO I DO HAVE A COMMON ON PARTICULAR THE THEME PARKS AS MY DISTRICT BUT BUT I CARE ABOUT ALL OF THIS COMMITTEES ISSUES BUT AS I HAVE- DISNEYLAND AND KNOTT'S BERRY FARM IN MY DISTRICT I THINK EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED IS NOT ONLY. IMPORTANT BUT IT IS VITAL I TOO AM CONFUSED. ABOUT WHY IN ESSENCE WE CAN HAVE BEACH IS OPEN WHICH YOU KNOW WE SELL ON LABOR DAY FOURTH OF JULY MANY MANY PEOPLE VERY CLOSE% TOGETHER- WE'VE SEEN A WHETHER IT BE SOME SCHOOLS OPENED WHETHER IT BE- OTHER PLACES THAT WOULD QUESTION WHY- PARKS WITH. QUITE A BIT OF ACREAGE CANNOT BE OPENED I THINK THIS IS US SENDS A MESSAGE TO OUR STATE- OR NOT TO OUR STATE TO THE PEOPLE LIVING IN OUR STATE THAT WE'RE NOT READY TO TAKE THIS ON. AN IDEA WENT TO MYSELF ON THE TOUR AND DOWNTOWN DISNEY AND SAW VERY CLEARLY. THAT IS THE PROTOCOLS ARE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY MUCH LIKE WHAT YOU SEE IN THE CAPITAL WITH TEMPERATURE TAKING- WITH SANITIZERS WITH JUSTIN SCENE AND I AM. HOPING THAT AFTER THIS HEARING WE WILL BE ABLE TO. BE VERY DETERMINED AND AGGRESSIVE IN PUSHING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS FORWARD AS FAR AS CONSISTENCY AS FAR AS GUIDELINES. THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE ONE OR TWO- THEME PARKS I'M NOT SURVIVE THIS THEY ARE VERY ICONIC TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S THAT EXPERIENCE THAT THEY DO SO WELL IT MAKING PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH OR GHOST TOWN OR WHAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE HOLLOWING HELL A HOT TIME AND THERE'S SO MANY SUPPLIERS AS FAR AS- THE PARTNERSHIPS IN THESE AREAS WITH UNIVERSAL MONTH MOTION PICTURES. SO I THINK IT'S OUR JOB ON THIS COMMITTEE TO BE- PUSHING FORWARD THIS TOPIC UNTIL WE GET ANSWERS THAT THANK YOU FOR IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT SO THEN WE'RE GOING TO NOW HAVE JOHN MAKE REYNOLDS WHO'S THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR UNIVERSAL PARKS AND RESORTS. IT'S NOT OVER HERE FOR THE. ALL RIGHT WE'RE READY- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I DON'T TAKE A SECOND STEP THANK YOU- STAFF IS WHO KEEPS US SAFE UP HERE CLEANING AND DOING ALL THE THINGS AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T THINK STAFF ENOUGH IT'S SOMETHING WE DO CONSTANTLY OF PERSONAL BECAUSE WE REALIZE THERE'S A THING. WE'VE GOT EQUATION T. SAP TEAM MEMBER SATISFACTION EQUALS G. SET GUEST SATISFACTION IT WAS A FAIR AND EQUITABLE RETURN WHAT IS A FAIR AND EQUITABLE RETURN IN VAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC IT MEANS SAFETY THAT'S A FAIR AND EQUITABLE RETURN. SOMETHING TO THE STAFF THANK YOU ALL WE GREATLY APPRECIATE IT- I'M HERE TODAY TO KIND OF PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON IT I'M NOT HERE TO. TRY TO BEAT UP BY ANYBODY ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS WE ALL KNOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS WE APPRECIATE THE RECENT CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF I DO WANT TO GO ON RECORD AND SAY THAT. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE WANT TO LOOK AT. YOU ALL AND SAY WE'RE READY TO HELP. WE'RE READY TO HELP WITH TO STEP UP AND I KNOW WE CAN IT. BECAUSE JOB IS. EXTERNAL AFFAIRS FREEDOM PERSONAL PARKS AND RESORTS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. I'VE GOT A TEAM AND SOCAGE PAN I'VE GOT A TEAM IN BEIJING. I'VE GOT TEAMS HERE AND TEAMS IN FLORIDA. WE KNOW WE CAN OPEN WE KNOW WE CAN DO IT WE KNOW WE CAN DO IT SAFE. WE HAVE DONE IT IN LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. AND WE'VE DONE IT WITH ABSOLUTELY ZERO PRESENCE. OF ANY CLUSTERS COMING OFF OF OUR SITE AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS. TO PROVE THAT CAN GO OVER THE PROTOCOLS. SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO DO TODAY IS TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE PROTOCOLS WE'VE HAD. SO YOU CAN SEE THE DEPTH OF WHAT WE'VE DONE TO TRY TO PROVE THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME SO EFFECTIVELY. AS YOU CAN SEE ALL THIS SKIP OVER THIS REALLY TO GET TO KEEP YOU ON TIME BUT IT'S REALLY TO SAY LOOK WE'RE HERE WE'RE READY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE'VE TRACKED TO THE RESILIENCY ROAD MAP OF WHAT OUR PROTOCOLS ARE AND HOW WE RE OPEN- OF THE CAR CALIFORNIA PUB EMPLOYEES WERE UNDER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND R. O. PARK AND OVER SEVEN THOUSAND FULL TIME. AND THEN A HANDFUL- THAN THOUSANDS OF SEASONAL. WE ARE DOWN TO ABOUT A THOUSAND FULL TIME- ACTIVE AND I THINK I HAVE TO BECAUSE FOR THE MOST PART WE HAVE TRIED TO KEEP EVERYONE ON WE COULD ON THE- ON THE- ROLES. MOST IMPORTANTLY HELPING OUT WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE AND SO FORTH BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE TO BE IN THIS TOGETHER. I GOT A PRAISE MY PARENT COMPANY COMCAST COMCAST STEPPED UP AND SAID WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. AND WE WERE THE VERY LAST IN OUR INDUSTRY TO REALLY FOR A LOW ANYBODY. BECAUSE WE WANTED TO DO WHATEVER WE COULD FOR THE SKE OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND AGAIN KUDOS TO THE ROBERTS FAMILY IN THE COMCAST COMPANY BECAUSE THEY REALLY DID STEP UP- AND BECAUSE OF THAT ALSO IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IN SOME OF OUR LOCATIONS LIKE FLORIDA WE WERE ABLE TO. OPEN SO QUICKLY BECAUSE WE WEREN'T PULLING PEOPLE BACK OFF FOR LONG. WE REALLY SAY OKAY LET'S GO LET'S GET THIS PLACE OPEN- WHEN WE KEEP GOING. SO THE GUEST JOURNEY LITERALLY WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PAGES OF PROTOCOL DOCUMENTS ON NOTHING BUT DEALING WITH BECAUSE OF IT AND OUR GUEST EXPERIENCE AND A TEAM MEMBER EXPERIENCE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PAGES. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IT STARTS WITH THE PRE ARRIVAL COMMUNICATIONS IT'S HOW YOU GET A MESSAGE TO THE GAS ARE YOU GOING TO TALKING THROUGH THE ENTIRE JOURNEY. NOT ONLY ONCE THEY GET THERE BUT LONG BEFORE WE'RE STARTING TO PLAN WITH THE SEED IN IN THEIR MINDS OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH WE TALK WE- LOOK AT THE ENTIRETY OF THE TRANSPORTATION OF LA BECAUSE WE ARE ALMOST AS MANY CITY. OF HOW WE HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR FOLKS ARE SECURITY CHECKS HOW WE WORK WITH PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE WERE SECURE HOW ARE OWN STAFFERS SECURE- SCREENING PEOPLE AND WE DO DO FULL TEMPERATURE CHECKS WE HAVE MANAGED TO MASK. AND I WILL TELL YOU ON THE TEMPERATURE CHECK ONE LITTLE ONE LITTLE KNOWN FACT. WHEN WE STARTED THE FIRST IN FLORIDA AND THEN I ALSO GET YOU BANNED EVERYBODY SAID WELL YOU KNOW ARE YOU REALLY GONNA CATCH PEOPLE. THE ANSWER IS. WE HAD NO SALES. AND YOU KNOW ONE WORD GOT. OUT IF YOU GOT A TEMPERATURE DON'T COME. WE DIDN'T A CHALLENGE WITH OUR PEOPLE. WITH HAVE PROBLEMS. IT WE HAD STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT. AND PEOPLE KNEW THEY JUST COULDN'T COME. AND IN THE FIRST TWO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION THEIR INTERNAL SAKA I THINK WE HAD A TOTAL OF A HANDFUL OF GAS THAT TURNED AROUND AND TURNED AWAY WHEN WE TOLD THEM NO YOU CAN'T COME IN IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA WEAR A MASK. EVERYBODY ELSE SAID THAT THE PRICE OF ADMISSION YOU GOT. SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE TAKE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FRONT ENTRY THE PARK ATMOSPHERE. AND FRACTIONS I MEAN WE REALLY TAKE EACH INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT OF THE VISIT. AND WE BREAK IT DOWN. AND WE BREAK IT DOWN INTO HOW WE GONNA KEEP OUR GUESTS SAFE AND HOW ARE WE GONNA DO IT EFFECTIVELY WITH OUR TEAM MEMBERS. FOR INSTANCE PROGRAM LAST YOU SIT DOWN YOU SENATE QUICK SERVE RESTAURANT WE'VE CONSERVING WE HAVE FULL SERVICE YOU'RE GETTING A PIECE OF PIZZA. SO I WAS WITH A GROUP OF FOLKS- FOR LUNCH TODAY AND I NOTICED REALLY TURNED THE TABLE. SIX OF THE VENICE FOR SITTING ON THE TABLE. SO WE SAID WAIT A SECOND YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS IT'S NOT SANTA THROUGH WHAT WE GONNA DO. SO ABSOLUTELY AFTER FIRST DAY OF OPENING WE SAID. EVERYWHERE YOU SAID TO EAT A MEAL WE'RE GOING TO OFFER YOU A LITTLE BACK. A LITTLE BAG TO PUT YOUR MASK AND FOR SANITATION PURPOSES. THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF THINGS WHERE THE BREED THE PROTOCOLS WE'VE ESTABLISHED OUR LIVING BREATHING DOCUMENTS. CALIFORNIA IS LUCKY. CALIFORNIA IS LUCKY BECAUSE YOU LAGGED AND I GET IT TOUGH CHOICES WERE BEING MADE I DON'T BELITTLE THE CHOICES THAT EITHER YOU ALL. FOR THE HEALTH OFFICIALS HAD TO MAKE. BUT YOUR LACKING THE INDUSTRY AROUND THE WORLD. BUT IT ALSO MEANS YOU'RE GONNA GET OUR BEST PROTOCOLS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE WORKED AND THEY HAVE COME TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE BEEN CONSTANT FEEDBACK WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS AND I DON'T MEAN JUST A VISIT TO GET A SOMETHING. THE HEALTH OFFICIALS IN THE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE OPERATE HAVE COME THROUGH MULTIPLE TIMES. IN ORDER TO HELP CONSTANTLY REFINE THE PROTOCOLS WITH NEW GUIDANCE NEW ADVICE AND SO FORTH. AND THEN ULTIMATELY YOU SEE AT THE END AND I'M GONNA GO INTO IT RIGHT NOW THE NEW STANDARDS OF WORK AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. SO WE TALK TO OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND WE SAID LOOK FIRST AND FOREMOST. YOU KNOW I. HEY HEARING STORIES LIKE FRANK SANTOS WE'RE HERE'S A HARD WORKER. THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN YOU KNOW FINANCED UNEMPLOYED AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAID TO OUR FOLKS WE'RE GONNA CREATE A ENVIRONMENT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO HELP US HELP YOU BUT NO THIS. IF YOU SUSPECT YOU'VE BEEN AROUND FAMILY MEMBERS OR ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND SOMEBODY WOULD CALL IT. YOUR JOB IS NOT GONNA BE THREATENED. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PENALTY POINTS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING. TELL US. TELL US WE'RE GONNA HELP MONITOR YEAH WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA LOOK AROUND WHO MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT AROUND YOU AT YOUR WORKPLACE AND AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION SO SOME OF THOSE FOLKS TO GO TAKE A COUPLE DAYS TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T SHOW ANY OF THE SYMPTOMS WHY. BECAUSE IT'S A SHORT TERM PAIN FOR A LONG TERM ABILITY TO OPERATE SAFELY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT AREN'T PLEASE OF ALL SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. AND THEN IT TALKS ABOUT THE ARRIVAL IN THE TRAINING AND EVEN THINGS LIKE AT FIRST WHEN WE WERE. WHEN WE ARE TAKING THE TEMPERATURE OF OUR PLACES THEY WERE TOUGH. AS THEY WERE- COMING YOU WOULD SAY OKAY WELL YOU KNOW THEY GET OUT OF THE CARS THAT PARK THE COMMENT. NO NO WE- WENT UP TO THEM WITH POLLING IN. CAR AND SET UP A CHECK SO WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THEIR TEMPERATURES AS THEY PULLED IN ONE. BECAUSE IT PREVENTED OTHER TOUCH POINTS FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF THE CAR COME INTO. IT'S THE LESSONS LEARNED OF HOW DO YOU PUSH THE GUIDANCE OUT FURTHER. AND THEN YOU TALK ABOUT TRAINING IN GUEST INTERACTION WE TRAINED. OUR EMPLOYEES OUR EMPLOYEES. IN OUR INDUSTRY ARE TRYING TO GO UP TO YOU. AND WE TALK ABOUT FACING. A GUEST AND LOOKING THEM IN THE EYE AND GIVING THEM THAT SPECIAL GUEST EXPERIENCE. WE SAID WE'RE GONNA TEACH YOU BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A COUPLE STEPS BACK IN STOCK THAT IS STATE A PHYSICALLY DISTANT. SPOT SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH TRAINING TO TEACH YOU A MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT IN IN YOUR IN YOUR MIND IN YOUR MIND SET. WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRAINED IN THE PAST. ONE DIRECTING THE ENGAGEMENT. RIGHT ONCE YOU DON'T EVEN THINK OF. IT WE HAVE THAT ARE SECOND THIRD FOURTH. EMPLOYEE AND THEY'RE FOR. HELLO EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THEM ARE FAMILY THEY'RE STILL FAMILIES SOME OF THESE FOLKS FISCHLER TECH SERVICE WORKERS HAVE BEEN TAKING LUNCHES TOGETHER FOR TWENTY YEARS. WE SAID FOLKS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO STAY THE BUT WE WILL YOU TO PUT IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND SOCIAL DISTANCING SITE YOU KNOW PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AND BE SMART IN UNDERSTAND THAT MASKS MATTER AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SO IT REMIND THEM CONSTANTLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE SIGNAGE EVERYWHERE AND WE ALSO HAVE OUR TEAM LEADERS BEEN TOLD. GO AROUND AND CHECK ON YOUR STAFF TO REINFORCE THE POSITIVE MESSAGING ON HOW WE'RE DOING YOU KOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IMPORTANT. I WILL TELL YOU WE MEASURE OUR TEAM SATISFACTION SCORES CONSTANTLY. AND I WILL TELL YOU THE INTERESTING PART OUR FACILITIES PEOPLE WHICH IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST JOBS BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY CLEANING ALL DAY. TYPICALLY THOSE T. SAID SCORES ARE GOOD FOR US BUT THEY'RE NOT THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE. I GOTTA TELL YOU POST CODE THAT'S CHANGED. BECAUSE ALL THE SUDDEN THEY UNDERSTAND THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US AND THE PRIDE IN BEING IN THAT DEPARTMENT HAS GONE UP EXPONENTIALLY WHICH WE CANNOT. THANK THEM ENOUGH FOR THEIR EFFORTS. SO YOU KNOW YOU PUT UP SOME BLUEPRINT. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WE ACTUALLY WENT DOWN AND ACTUALLY MAXTONE. FOR POINT FOR POINT. AND I WILL GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE ONE NOW TO TRY TO KEEP YOU ON SCHEDULE BUT I'LL BE GLAD TO LEAVE THE POWER POINT WITH YOU ALSO YOU CAN SEE. HOW WE COMPARE THEM TOGETHER AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO DRIVE TO THE ANSWERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY SO I WANT TO POINT OUT JUST. ONE THING ESPECIALLY ON THIS IF I COULD. AND THAT IS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LIMIT PEOPLE MIXING PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS ARE AIMED AT KEEPING DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS. I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT FOR SECONDS IT'LL TELL YOU HOW WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR MINDSET. TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE BECAUSE EVERYTHING WE DO IN OUR INDUSTRIES ABOUT THROUGHPUT HOW MANY PEOPLE COMING THROUGH PUT ON A RIDE TO THE TRACTION IF I CAN'T GET THE OF THE MARK IT'S NOT GOOD AND WE CHECK IN ON AN HOURLY BASIS AND IF WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT SOMETHING NOT MIXING WILL CHANGE OF TEAM WILL FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT THROUGH PUT DONE. IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POST COMMENT. WE TOOK THOSE SINGLE RIDER LINES THAT WE USED TO DO TO FILL AN EMPTY SPOT. ON ANY TO LINE THAT CAME TOO CLOSE. AND WENT INTO THAT SIX WITH SEPARATION WE TOOK OUT THREE DESIGN. WE DID THINGS LIKE LOADING EVERY OTHER ROADS WE DID THE THINGS THAT WE SAID WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE COMMITMENT AND LIVE UP TO THE SAFETY GUIDELINES PROTOCOLS WHICH WE DON'T NEED NEVER DID NEED A SAFETY PROTOCOLS GIVE US OUR LIMITATIONS AND WITH THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS WE'VE BEEN PUT IN PLACE HONESTLY TO GET ABOVE WOULD WE WANT TO BECAUSE THE G. SEPTIC GUEST SATISFACTION NUMBER WOULD JUST DISAPPEAR NOBODY COME BACK. SO THE REALITY OF IT IS THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL DISTINGUIR GARMENTS THAT WE MANDATE IN OUR QUEUE LINES IN OUR TRACKS AND EVERYTHING ELSE ARE GONNA DETERMINE THAT PERCENTAGE NO WE UNDERSTAND STATE WILL PROBABLY WANT TO LOOK AT A PERCENTAGE WE GET THAT. BUT UNDERSTAND IT'S ALREADY THERE FOR US IN WHERE WE OPERATE AROUND THE GLOBE. MOST IMPORTANTLY GETTING CALIFORNIANS BACK TO WORK SAFELY. I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THAT NUMBER RIGHT THERE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF CONSTRUCTION WORK IS NO LONGER. ONE COMPANY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A CONSTRUCTION WORK ON CAPITOL. OFF THE BOOKS. THE SOONER WE CAN GET BACK OPEN THE SOONER THAT WE CAN LOOK AT POTENTIAL NEW PROJECTS ON THE ROAD BECAUSE NEW PROJECTS MEAN CONSTANT VISITATION BUT UNDERSTANDING IN THIS MARKET AND I WILL BE BACK WITH THE THERE'S A CALIFORNIA GIRL ON THE TEAM SAID. GUESS WHAT THIS IS ALL DRIVE MARKET RIGHT NOW I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S FOLKS WANT TO LOOK AT A MILEAGE AND SO FORTH IT IS ALL PRIVATE MARKET. I KNOW. BECAUSE I'M THE ONE THAT GETS TO DEAL WITH THE BUSINESS JUST TO TRY TO GET SOME VENDORS BACK INTO JAPAN AND CHINA. NOBODY'S TRAVELING. FACT ONE OF THE FEW COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE WE'RE BUILDING A PARK IN THE MIDDLE OF BEIJING. TALK ABOUT SOME REAL IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS. I HAD TO GET THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE BACK INTO BEIJING IN THE MIDDLE OF COLOR. BUT THE REALITY OF IT IS I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS ARE PLACED ON THE INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL ANOTHER QUESTION WAS ASKED BEFORE. IT'S NOT HAVE. OKAY JUST TODAY I WAS ON THE PHONE THE JAPANESE EMBASSY TRYING TO GET SIX HUNDRED PACKAGE DIDN'T TO JAPAN. SO THE REALITY IS. WE WANT TO FOCUS ON GETTING. WORKERS BACK HERE. WE KNOW THE VISITATION WILL BE WITHIN THE LOCAL MARKET THAT PRODUCT. YES WILL BE A LITTLE LOUDER YOU ASK BUT NOT AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD THINK. SO AS PEOPLE WORRY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANT TO TAKE AND TAKE YOUR MIND. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A THEME PARK YOU THINK ABOUT THE FOURTH OF JULY. YOU THINK ABOUT JAMPACKED PARKS. WITH THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS THAT'S NOT THE NORM ANYMORE AND WE HAVE GOT TO GET THE STATE OFF THE MIND SET UP I SEE A HUGE BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN A SINGLE LOCATION. IN FACT THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS SAYING ALL THESE. FACTORS THAT I PUT ON THE ON THE BOARD AGAIN I KNOW I'M FROM RUSSIA TO KEEP YOU GUYS ON SCHEDULE. BUT THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION AT ALL THE HEALTH OFFICIALS EXPECT THE POLITICS OF IT ALL THE HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE SAID. TO ME PERSONALLY AROUND THE GLOBE. HOW CAN YOU GUARANTEE PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND WE GO THROUGH THE PROTOCOLS AND THEY GO YOU ARE PART OF THE ANSWER BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES ANOTHER SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR THEY'RE JUST NOT. WE KNOW WHERE THE TRANSMISSIONS ARE HAPPENING A LOT OF TIMES ARE HAPPENING THOSE LARGE FAMILY BARBECUES AND EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN YOU GET THE GATHERINGS PEOPLE FEEL CLOSE THEY SEEM TO KNOW EACH OTHER. WE'RE WE REALLY SHOULD BE ASKING REGARDLESS OF THE VOLUMES IN WE'RE CAN YOU PUT PEOPLE SAFELY. THAT WILL GIVE THEM AN OUTLET. GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO DO BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT THE REGULATORY. REGULATORY CONTROLS TO CREATE THAT PHYSICAL DISTANCES. THEME PARKS ARE YOUR ANSWER. AND I KNOW THAT'S WEIRD SOME STRANGE. BUT WHEN THE HEALTH OFFICIALS IN BOTH FLORIDA AND JAPAN NOT THE POLITICIANS ON ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE MINDSETS OF SOME FOLKS ON HOW FLOOR OPEN TO QUICK AND SO FORTH WITHOUT GETTING INTO THAT IT WAS THAT HEALTH OFFICIALS IT SAID WE HAVE GOT TO PUT THESE PEOPLE SOME MORE. AND IT WAS THE HEALTH OFFICIALS THAT MADE THE ULTIMATE DECISION WHERE TO WHAT WE'RE TO DO THAT. SO WE'VE GOT SOME OF OUR PREVENTIVE MEASURES THAT U. S. H. YOU'RE JUST SOME SIGNS THAT WE HAVE ALL OVER THE PLACE. IN OUR OPERATIONS IN OSAKA JAPAN IN BEIJING IN ORLANDO. WE'VE COME UP WITH THE STANDARDS- EVERYWHERE YOU GO. WE HAVE HIRED ADDITIONAL STAFF TO SERVICE AND BASS CENTERS TO DO NOTHING BUT ROAD IN THE PARK. AND TO CREATE AND REMINDER CONSTANTLY OF WHAT TO DO WE PUT IN A KEY CHOKEPOINTS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE SO PHYSICALLY DISTANCED. WE DON'T WANT OTHER THING THAT THE LOCAL HEALTH ARE. ABOUT AROUND THE WORLD. BUT SAID MASS ARE POOR RIGHT. BUT IF YOU'RE OUT IN THE SUN EIGHT TO TEN HOURS. SO IS A COUPLE MINUTES FRESH AIR. SO WE CREATED FREE SAFE ZONES WHERE WE CAN PROBLEM AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT SEPARATION BE PUT BETWEEN PARTIES AND ALLOW THEM TO GO IN AND TAKE OFF THE MASKS. AND THEN WE ONLY LET HIM GO IN THERE FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES AND I'M BACK IN THE PARK WE DON'T WANT TO DO A LOT OF FOOD AND DRINK IN THERE OR ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S NOT WE'RE GONNA GO GRAB YOUR LUNCH. AND IT'S WORKED OUT FANTASTICALLY IN THE HEALTH OFFICIALS AND LOVED IT. IN FACT I'D LIKE TO GET TO THIS THIS IS A THIS IS A QUOTE FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY FLORIDA HEALTH OFFICIAL DR ROUTE. I'M SORRY RALPH PENA ROLLA'S JUST BEEN FANTASTIC BEEN. ABLE TO WORK WITH. READ THIS WE ACTUALLY I HAD A I HAVE NOT HAD A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THE THEME PARKS THEY HAVE TAKEN THIS VERY SERIOUSLY THEY ARE NOT ONLY INTERESTED IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS. BUT THEY ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN PROTECTING THEIR BRAND. SO FAR THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD. THAT'S WHAT THE PERSON WITH DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF OUR INDUSTRY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I TOLD HIM FROM DAY ONE YOU SEE A CLUSTER I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE SHOT NOW. AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED. SO JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE PICTURES OF. WHAT SOME OF THE ENTRY HOUSE LOOKS LIKE THIS IS IMPORTANT HOW IT WOULD LOOK THE SAME. LITTLE BIT OF SOCIAL DISTANCING PEOPLE YOU ARE DOING IT BY THEM BY THEMSELVES AS THEY WALKED THROUGH THE WALKWAYS THIS IS OUR ENTRANCE TO ISLANDS OF ADVENTURE. AND HERE IS KIND OF UNIQUE YOU SEE THE BOTTOM OF. THIS AREA. THE TALKS ARE ALREADY THERE ONE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GUARANTEE THE SHOCK AND GATES WERE YOU TYPICALLY ARE SENATE NEXT SOMEBODY WOULD NOT BE AN INTERFERENCE AND SO WE CAN LOW PEOPLE IN IN ROW AFTER ROW BUT IN A SEPARATE CONTAINED WAY SO THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE ALL THAT TOP PART ABOUT THE TURNSTILES. ARE ONLY. SO WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE MONEY TO DO THIS RIGHT AND WE CONTINUE TO DO SO. BUT. FOR GOING TO THE NEXT SO WITH THAT I GUESS WANT SAY THANK YOU LET BE PART OF SALUTE. LET US HELP OPEN THIS. AND GIVE PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR- THE MEMBERS WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF OUR GAS AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. THANK YOU. GREAT JOB. AND I HOPE THAT SOME OF THE GUESTS ARE HERE ALSO TAKING NOTES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS NOT ONLY LOOKING AT SOLUTIONS BUT IT'S LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER. AND FROM EXPERIENCES. RICHARD ANY COMMENTS OF. HEALTH ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT DETAIL AND THERE'S A LOT TO CHEW ON HERE AS YOU KNOW SOME OF US OF- SIGNED LETTERS AND IN SUPPORT OF- MAKING SURE THAT- YOUR INDUSTRY GETS BACK ON ITS FEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I DO HOPE THAT THE ISSUES THAT ARE. PERCOLATING OKAY GET RESOLVED VERY SOON. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT- FROM THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM WE HAVE JULIE PACKARD. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. THANK YOU WELCOME JULIE CAN LOOK AT MUSIC. WELL GREENS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE MODERATE A QUORUM AND THE SEASON AQUARIUMS O CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE PART OF THE WHOLE PICTURE HERE OF CALIFORNIA TOURISM. SO OF COURSE IT'S BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING TIME I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU WHAT A TIME TO BE A PUBLIC SERVANT WELL. NOW THAT'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY FOR ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE. OF COURSE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM HAS DOWN THE ANCHOR OF TOURISM ON THE MONTEREY PENINSULA SINCE WE OPENED OUR DOORS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. AND TO BE HONEST WHEN MY FAMILY FIRST FOUNDED AND CREATED THE A CORE AND WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE WOULD. EVER BE IN A CRISIS LIKE WHEN WE ARE IN TODAY THAT- THAT HONESTLY IS COMING PRETTY CLOSE TO THREATENING OR OUR WHOLE EXISTENCE. SO AS OF YESTERDAY- WATER BE CURRENTS BEEN CLOSED- FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND OF COURSE. BASED ON THE TRAJECTORY OF KOBE CASES AND RECOVERY MONTEREY COUNTY- WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'LL BE ALLOWED TO OPEN. AND THE THING ABOUT AQUARIUMS AND M. INSTITUTIONS LIKE OURS IS THAT YOU CAN'T YOURSELF THE DOOR AND CALLED IN AND BE CLOSED- WE SPENT ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS. EVERY MONTH AND ANIMAL CARE. ALONE AND OF COURSE WITHOUT ANY ADMISSIONS REVENUE TO SUPPORT THE SERVICES ARE CORAM LIKE OTHER CALIFORNIA USE OF KOREANS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO MAKE REALLY BIG CUTS AND OTHER PARTS OF OUR BUDGET LIKE MANY OF YOUR SPEAKERS HERE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT ALONE FOR US. THAT INCLUDED- A REALLY HEARTBREAKING HEARTBREAKING LOSS OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EMPLOYEES- ANNABELLA FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REVENUE. DEFICIT ARE LOSS THIS YEAR. SO LIKE YOU WERE SUPER COMMITTED TO SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IS OUR TOP PRIORITY WHICH- IS WHY WE'VE WORKED WITH- WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THE DESIGN RIGOROUS DATA DRIVEN SAFETY MEASURES LIKE THE ONES YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT. DIFFERENT THE SPREAD AMONG OUR STAFF FOR VISITORS AND EVEN OUR ANIMALS. AND WE'VE ALSO JOINED WITH THE KOREANS ACROSS THE STATE TO ADOPT A CONSISTENT SET OF PROTOCOLS EVERYONE TO AGREE TO THE SAME PROTOCOLS FOR INSTITUTIONS THAT EXCEED THOSE OF OTHER SECTORS. YEAH OF COURSE THE AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH EARNED NEEDED. SIDE FROM THE FACT THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO- BUT ALSO BECAUSE CORPS INTRODUCE CANNOT SHUT DOWN FOR CORE OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE COVERED CRISIS. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO CARE FOR THE THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS IN OUR CARE. AND OF COURSE UNFORTUNATELY THE CARERS COME AT A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL COST OF PUTTING. FUTURE OF OUR KOREAN AND THE KOREANS INTO'S ACROSS THE STRAIT ACTUALLY IN PARTICULAR PERIL. SOME OF THEM GOT SOME EARLY SUPPORT BUT OF COURSE LIKE MANY BUSINESSES AS YOU KNOW THAT'S NO LONGER AVAILABLE AND MANY OF THE MARIN AND IN REALLY BIG TROUBLE. ALSO ALONG WITH THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF CLOSURES HELD ON THE REVENUE PERSONNEL'S COURSE ALSO UNDERMINED A ROLES A DRIVER OF MONTEREY COUNTY'S THREE BILLION DOLLAR TOURISM ECONOMY. OTHERS ESTIMATED SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOSPITALITY WORKERS AND ARE COUNTY ALONE THAT ARE UNEMPLOYED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THAT. AND VISITORS ARE TRULY THE LIFE BLOOD OF MODERATE ECONOMIES MODERATE ECONOMY ALLEN- CORRIMAL LOAN AND- TWENTY NINETEEN WELCOME TO MILLION GAS THAT SORT OF OUR AVERAGE EVERY YEAR. AND THEN INCLUDED A HUNDRED THOUSAND- CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ADMITTED FREE OF CHARGE ALL OF OUR EDUCATION PROGRAMS HAVE FREE ADMISSION. AND OF COURSE CENTER IN THE CITY'S RELY HEAVILY ON SALES AND HOTEL TAXES SOME VISITORS TO SUSTAIN. ALL THE VITAL HEALTH. SAFETY AND OTHER PUBLIC SERVICES. THIS YEAR MODERATE. THOSE ESTIMATED TO LOSE FORTY MILLION TAX REVENUE AND PROJECTED LOSSES. FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR TRIPLE THAT TOTAL- COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN THAT SUB 73% OF CLIENTS THAT YOU KNOW SIMILAR. SIMILAR NUMBERS THAT SELL NOW- FAMILIAR VERY FAMILIAR TO YOU DESPITE THE CLOSURE OF THE AQUARIUM THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN SOME GOOD NEWS NEVER WASTE A CRISIS- WE CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC CAN ACTUALLY HAVE GROWN OUR AUDIENCE- OUR VIRTUAL AUDIENCE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE NO REVENUE COMING IN- WE'VE WE'VE GROWN OUR AUDIENCE- TO A- LARGER NUMBER THAN EVERY EVER BEFORE. WE'VE HOSTED FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS SO FAR MOST FROM CALIFORNIA FOR FREE ONLINE DISTANCE LEARNING CLASSES IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA START OFFERING VIRTUAL FIELD TRIPS SERVING AS MANY AS FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS A WEEK FROM ACROSS THE STATE THE- AGAIN ALL FREE OF CHARGE SO. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME AND I FIELD SOUTH OF KOREANS ARE PROVIDING HOPE AND SALAS AND- A PLACE TO CONNECT WITH ANIMALS AND THE NATURAL WORLD. WE GET COMMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE WATCHING OVER WEBCAMS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD JUST- TO CONNECT WITH NATURE AND HAVE SOME PEACE. BUT OF COURSE WITHOUT GETTING BACK IN BUSINESS WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO LIVER THESE. SERVICES INDEFINITELY AND- MY MESSAGE. TODAY IS TO ASK YOU TO JOIN US IN APRONG APPROACH TO HELP FOR OF ALL AND HONESTLY OF COURSE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR CLOVER NINETEEN PREVENTION AND RECOVERY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SECOND TO HELP US OPEN AND THIRD TO WORK WITH US TO FIND SOURCES OF FINANCIAL RELIEF. SO MOST IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND WORKERS MOST AT RISK FROM COVER NINETEEN. AND THAT THE KOREAN WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENDORSE THE STATE'S NEW EQUITY HEALTHEQUITY METRIC SO IMPORTANT SUCH A GOOD MOVE AND- COURSE IS GOING TO HELP ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE MOST AFFECTED. BY COVER NINETEEN ARE GIVEN THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. IN MONTEREY COUNTY THE SEVENTY UP SORRY. I WISH IT WAS 1770% OF PEOPLE INFECTED WITH COCA NINETEEN OR LATIN ACTS. AND MANY POSITIVE CASES ARE OCCURRING AMONG THE FORMER FOR COMMUNITY IN SALINAS AND SLING THIS. THESE WORKERS WERE ESSENTIAL OF COURSE YET LACKED. OF BEACON SECURITY. HOUSING AND HEALTH CARE THIS INEQUITY DEMANDS OUR COLLECTIVE ATTENTION. THE KOREANS WORKING CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AGRICULTURE HOSPITALITY COUNTY GOVERNMENTS AND FOUNDATIONS INCLUDING THE DAVID AND LUCILLE PACKARD FOUNDATION THAT I'M INVOLVED WITH TO PROMOTE A STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE FEEL THAT IT'S UP TO ALL THE BUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY TO DO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS GET. GET OUR COMMUNITY RECOVERED. SO WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU IS YOUR SUPPORT TO FOCUS STATE RESOURCES ON THE REGION'S IN CALIFORNIA THAT NEED IT MOST INCLUDING MONTEREY COUNTY. SO SECOND ALL CALIFORNIA THE KOREANS THAT MEET THE STATE'S STRICT REOPENING GUIDANCE THE NEED TO BE ALLOWED TO OPEN IN TIER ONE AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO REPEATED OPENING AND CLOSING AS THEY ARE NOW. RIGHT NOW MODERATE A KOREAN CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER AND THE CABRILLO MARINE AQUARIUM IN LA. THEY'RE THE ONLY THREE ACCREDITED ASSOCIATION IS THE OWNER CORAM INSTITUTIONS IN THE NATION THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO REOPEN BECAUSE OUR COUNTIES ARE IN TIER ONE. AND N. AS WAS JUST STATED BEFORE- MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN OPEN SINCE JULY AND I'VE LEARNED A LOT SO BY THE TIME WE GOT TO OPEN HOPEFULLY SOON. WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION UNDER OUR BELT. SO RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH WE HAVE STRICTER STATE MANDATED RE OPENING REQUIREMENTS THAN OTHER INDOOR ESTABLISHMENTS THE KOREANS IN TIER ONE COUNTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPEN EVEN AT JUST 25% CAPACITY WHICH WOULD BE OUR FIRST OPENING- STEP WHILE THE STATE ALLOWS OTHER NONESSENTIAL INDOOR ESTABLISHMENTS LIKE SHOPPING MALLS WHICH HAVE FAR FEWER CONTROLS TO OPEN OPENING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE MANDATORY PRE VISIT SOMETIMES SCREENING SCREENING OF ONE WAY VISITOR PATHS MANDATORY MOUSE FOR EVERYONE. OVER AGE TO TIME TAKE ADMISSIONS SOLD ONLY BY- AT ADVANCE RESERVATIONS. AND UNDER THESE COVERT NINETEEN SAFETY MEASURES THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOST FAR FEWER PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING AND THEN UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE ON A BUSY- PICK SUMMER DAY WE MIGHT HAVE- EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE AQUARIUM AT ONE TIME. UNDER THESE COVERT CONDITION RESTRICTIONS AT THIS REDUCE CAPACITY WE ESTIMATE THERE MAYBE JUST FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE. AT ANY ONE TIME IN THE AQUARIUM SO THAT JUST GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SPACING THAT THAT WILL BE GOING ON. AND ALSO THEY'RE LIKELY STAY FOR SHORTER TIME BECAUSE WE'RE CLOSING ALL THE EXHIBITS. THAT ARE BOTH CHILDREN- BUT AND ONE BALL TOUCH EXPERIENCES. AND THE CLOSURE AUDITORIUM IN ANY PLACE THAT WOULD- WOULD POSE A RISK. SO A CRIMES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALREADY A REALLY CONSCIOUS APPROACH TO DATE NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THE OVER. HAVE REPORTED A COVERED NINETEEN TRANSMISSION CASE. SO OF THE THIRD THE THIRD MESSAGE- IN TERMS OF HOW THE STATE CAN HELP IS- THE CALIFORNIA AQUARIUMS AND ZOOS THEY ALSO NEED FINANCIAL RELIEF- THE STAGGERING REVENUE LOSSES PAIRED WITH THE HIGH COST OF ANIMAL CARE. CARE THAT WE CANNOT STOP PROVIDING HAVE BROUGHT MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS TO THE BRINK- TO DATE MONTEREY BAY AQURIUM HAS BEEN ENTIRELY LEFT OUT OF THE ENACTED FEDERAL CODE RELIEF BECAUSE WE DIDN'T MEET THE FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEE LEVEL AND JUST BECAUSE YOUR BIG DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'S EASIER IT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT YOU HAVE. A HUGE ANIMAL COLLECTION AT A BIG BUILDING AND A LOT OF EXPENSES AND SO IT ALMOST SO YOU YOU YOU LOSE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FASTER THAN. PERHAPS THIS IS IF YOU WERE SMALLER- WITH UNNECESSARILY SLOW- A REAL OPENING PACE WHICH IS THE RIGHT THING. AND LIMITS AND VISITOR CAPACITY YOU KNOW HONESTLY THE FATE OF CALIFORNIA'S USE AN AQUARIUMS. WE'RE GOING TO REMAIN IN JEOPARDY FOR MONTHS IF NOT YEARS AND I BELIEVE YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM JUST ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. SO WE UNDERSTAND OUR ENTIRE STATE IS A NEED RIGHT NOW THAT'S WHY OUR KOREAN ALONG WITH THEIR PEERS ACROSS THE NATION CONTINUE TO PRESS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR STATE AD LOCAL RELIEF AND CORONA FUNDING BILLS WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD ON THAT ALL TOGETHER ALONG WITH THE NATIONAL MUSEUM COMMUNITY- AND SO TODAY I'M ASKING YOU TO INCLUDE AQUARIUMS AND ZOOS IN THE STATE REALLY STRATEGIES. THAT WILL ENABLE US. TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE STATE'S EDUCATION CONSERVATION GOALS BECAUSE WORLD NON PROFITS THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE'RE PROVIDING HUGE SERVICES ESSENTIAL SERVICES I BELIEVE IN EDUCATION ESPECIALLY DURING. THE HYBRID- PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND A LOT OF WORK UP IN A LOT OF ONE SCHOOL AT HOME THAT'S GOING ON THAT NEEDS- CURRICULUM RESOURCES DIGITAL ONES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO THE KOREAN LIKE OTHER MAINSTAYS OF HER TOURISM ECONOMY. WE'RE OUR EXISTENCE AND- WORLD BIT ROCKS EVER COMMUNITIES ALONG WITH BEING KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD AS LEADERS IN SCIENCE EDUCATION AND CONSERVATION WE'RE ABSOLUTELY WELL PREPARED TO FACE THE NEW REAL A REALITY WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY- BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP TO SURVIVE THE CRISIS AND CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. INTO THE FUTURE SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON ALL ALL HOPE FOR THE BEST IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCES YOU PROVIDE TO OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES I HAVE BEEN TO. MANY OF THE KOREANS THAT YOU MENTIONED. ALL OF THEM I THINK YES. ALL RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO WRAP UP WITH ALL THIS- THE LAST THREE PRISONERS THE ROAD AHEAD. AND WE APPRECIATE THOSE OF YOU ARE HANGING IN THERE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN EXPECTED SO WE'LL TRY TO BE AS SWIFT AS POSSIBLE WITH OUR LAST THREE SPEAKERS. WE HAVE.

AS PREVIOUSLY TO OUR INDUSTRY HAS LOST OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS SINCE FEBRUARY- A DRASTIC REDUCTION FROM THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION JOBS TOURISM PROVIDED CALIFORNIANS PRIVATE PRIOR TO PUT IT NINETEEN. MANY OF THESE JOBS AS THE OTHERS HAVE TESTIFIED WILL NOT COME BACK ONCE WE ARE OUT OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. VISIT CALIFORNIA'S REVENUE WHICH IS FUNDED BY PRIVATE BUSINESSES THROUGH A SELF IMPOSED ASSESSMENT BASED ON INCOME HAS BEEN REDUCED TO MORE THAN HALF. THIS IS WHY CAL TRAVEL ON BEHALF OF IS A CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WORKING WITH SENATOR MCGUIRE. AND OTHER TOURISM TOURISM CHAMPIONS IN THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY INCLUDING BOTH OF YOU AND MANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES- TO HELP PRIORITIZE A FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FOR VISIT CALIFORNIA'S MARKETING EFFORTS. THROUGH EITHER ABOUT BUDGET ALLOCATION OR A STIMULUS PACKAGE. THIS FUNDING WOULD AUGMENT VISIT CALIFORNIAS CAMPAIGN LETTING TRAVELERS KNOW THE CALIFORNIA DESTINATIONS ARE PRIORITIZING THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY AND TO PROMOTE BEST PRACTICES FOR RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL ACROSS ALL SECTORS. I THINK CALIFORNIANS TRAVELING AGAIN WILL ENABLE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES TO REOPEN. GET WORKERS BACK TO THEIR JOBS AND ULTIMATELY HELP JUMPSTART A QUICK RECOVERY OF OUR ECONOMY. WE NOTICED WORKS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT AND ACTION AFTER THE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN ATTACKS IMMEDIATELY AFTER NINE ELEVEN GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS MADE A ONE TIME ALLOCATION TO VISIT CALIFORNIA THAT FUELED A MULTI TIERED IN STATE AND DRIVE MARKET CAMPAIGN. DESIGNED TO GIVE CALIFORNIANS THE CONFIDENCE TO REDISCOVER OUR GREAT STATE. THE CAMPAIGN WAS SUCCESSFUL IN STATE TRAVEL JUMPED 10% IN 200-012-2000 TWO AND TOURISM WAS ONE OF THE FASTEST AND STREETS TO RECOVER. IF GIVEN AN ALLOCATION TODAY IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT WAS A CALIFORNIA CAN GENERATE TEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE TO CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND ADDITIONAL STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE. THIS ONE TIME FUNDING WOULD BE AN IMPACTFUL DOWN PAYMENT TO HELP CALIFORNIA RECOVER. FROM THE DIRE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF FOR THE NINETEEN. EVERY DOLLAR SPENT BY TRAVELER POWERS OKAY OUR LOCAL COUNTY COMMUNITIES MANY TIMES OVER. FOR EXAMPLE THE TAXES PAID BY HOTEL AND VACATION RENTAL GUESTS DIRECTLY POWER LOCAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. FORTY SIX CITIES RELY ON TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX REVENUES TO COVER AT LEAST 30% OF THEIR OVERALL GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES. ASIDE FROM THIS CRITICAL FUNDINGTHE LEGISLATURE CAN SUPPORTER STRUGGLING INDUSTRY AND FEW OTHER WAYS. WITH THE GOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNABLE TO COME TO A CONSENSUS AND ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RELIEF WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE STATE LEVEL SUPPORT BUSINESSES SHOULDERING THE COSTS OF ACQUIRING PP. AND ENHANCED CLEANING AND SANITIZATION PROTOCOL. ANOTHER PLACE OF SUPPORT WOULD BE TO OFFER A TEMPORARY TAX CREDIT TO CALIFORNIANS ONCE IT'S SAFE TO REALLY PICK UP TRAVEL TO INCENTIVIZE DOMESTIC BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAVEL AND STATE. ONCE WE'VE SEEN. OUR COUNTIES PROGRESS FURTHER IN A TIERED SYSTEM. THE TAX CREDIT WOULD WORTH 50% OF QUALIFIED TRAVEL EXPENSES FOR A LIMITED TIME PERIOD. QUALIFIED TRAVEL EXPENSES WOULD INCLUDE ANY-EXPENSE OVER FIFTY DOLLARS AND HURDLE TRAVELING IN CALIFORNIA AWAY FROM HOME WITH LANGUAGE TO EXPLICITLY REFERENCE EXPENSES RELATED TO MEALS. LODGING RECREATION TRANSPORTATION MUSEUM OR ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS MEETINGS OR EVENTS AND FUEL. DETAILS I CAN SHARE WITH STAFF. FINALLY WE NEED TO LEGISLATORS HELP ADVOCATING FOR THE FEE FREE OPENING OF BUSINESS MEETINGS WHICH WAS DISCUSSED PRETTY. PRETTY BROADLY BY JOE DALLESANDRO EARLIER IN HEARING- SPEAKING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO US DURING HIS PRESENTATION WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON STANDARDS BOTH FOR BUSINESS MEETINGS ON A SMALLER SCALE AND CONVENTIONS AND TRADE SHOWS. BUT WE NEED APPROVAL AND GUIDANCE AND A CLEAR INDICATION OF WHEN WE CAN BRING BACK THIS IMPORTANT SEGMENT OF THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO PRESERVE BUSINESS THAT TAKES YEARS TO SECURE PLAN AND EXECUTE. AS IT IS WE ARE LOSING BUSINESS TO OTHER STATES WHO ARE HOSTING EVENTS WITH ALCOHOL BREAKS. INDIANAPOLIS FOR EXAMPLE HOSTED EIGHTEEN EVENTS IN FORTY DAYS WITH NO EXHIBITED INCREASE IN CASES AND ONE OF THE EVENTS HOSTED. WAS ABOUT NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE. MARKETING FROM INDIANAPOLIS ACTUALLY IS TALKING ABOUT HOW THE **** DRIVABLE AND THERE ARE CAPTURING OUR OUR BUSINESS RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK AND TO. DR PANTS POINT EARLIER- BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO MEET NOW AND HAVE BEEN MEETING NOW THEY'RE ABLE TO SECURE BUSINESS FOR FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE REALLY WANT TO KEEP THAT BUSINESS FROM. GOING AWAY FOREVER I SAW AN EXAMPLE- ONE OF OUR- MEMBERS SHOWED US A CONTRACT THAT WAS CANCELED. FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT WAS BOOKED IN- TWENTY SEVENTEEN JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE LONG LEAD TIME THAT'S NEEDED TO KEEP THAT. BUSINESS AND STATE ANYTHING THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO EASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND ENCOURAGE ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIANS TO TRAVEL AGAIN WILL GO A LONG WAY. TOWARD REPAIRING ARE DEVASTATED TOURISM ECONOMY I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN FEELING A LACK OF SUPPORT AND- IS WE'RE TOLD THAT WE CAN'T OPEN BUT WE'RE NOT GIVEN ANY- STOP GAPS- FOR EXAMPLE WISCONSIN JUST MOVE BACK IN THEIR RE OPENING. 27% CAPACITY FOR INDOOR GATHERINGS. BUT THEN THE GOVERNOR TURNED AROUND AND HE ALLOCATED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TOURISM INDUSTRY TO HELP KEEP BUSINESSES THE FLOW. SO IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR HANDS TIED WE DO NEED THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT. I THINK THE LEGISLATORS ON A REALLY GREAT JOB OF SUPPORTING THE WORKERS AND WE SAW A LOT OF BILLS. GET PASSED THIS YEAR THEY DO PROTECT WORKERS AND WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO WORKERS. TO GO BACK TO WORK BUT IF BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING. AND THEY'VE SHUT DOWN FOREVER THAT WORK GOES AWAY- THAT BEING SAID WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE WORK. OF REVIVING OUR INDUSTRY WITH YOU AND ADVANCING OUR SHARED GOAL OF JUMPSTARTING OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. IN THE WAKE OF THE CURRENT ADDRESS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND AGAIN SOME SPECIFIC ASKS THAT I THINK- MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO. HOW CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE DAN GORDON CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE GORDON BURTCH BREWING COMPANY. GERMAN AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY HAVE A LITTLE PRESENTATION I LIKE TO BRING UP. YOU HAVE YEAH. THOSE ARE MY THIS IS JUST THE NEXT SLIDE- OR THIS YEAR OKAY LARRY OUR DO I THAT'S ME OF THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO WAS WHEN WE OPEN UP IN PALO ALTO ALL RIGHT OR NICHE WAS THREE RESTAURANTS WE ARE. GILT EIGHT INCOME. THIRTEEN TOTALED SELLING OTHER RESTAURANT COMPANY DUE TO YOU HOUSE. THE COMPANY THAT ACQUIRED US CONTINUE OPEN UP TO THIRTY EIGHT NATIONWIDE WITH ANOTHER FOUR. IN THE ACTION NOW FIVE IN TAIWAN CURRENTLY THERE'S ONE IN CALIFORNIA. SEVEN IN THE U. S. FIVE A TAIWAN. IT'S GONNA BE KIND OF INTERESTING STAT- OBVIOUSLY FINANCIAL TURMOIL FROM COVE IT IS TAKEN DOWN SO MANY RESTAURANTS AND WERE ONE OF THE- FATALITIES BUT I BUILT A BREWERY IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. AND LIKELY THAT IS BEEN THE SAVING GRACE FOR ME MY FAMILY AND MY COMPANY. THE RECORD FOR A DUTY COVE IT IT'S VERY SOMEONE AND- WE UP WE'RE IN THEIR WE HAVE FOR RESTAURANT LOOKING AND HER. EITHER A SHUT DOWN NO DRAFT THERE. ALL THE STATE I AGREED GARLIC YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THEM. THEREAFTER SOME OF IMPORT FOOD NOW. THEY THEY DON'T EXIST RIGHT AFTER WE DON'T I WAS. GOING ON LIFE SPORTS OF THE SPORTS IN IS A FROM SPONSOR FLY. AND THERE THERE'S A WHOLE SUPPLIES ANDIN A THAT. THAT IS LACKING HER FROM THE- ARE REPRESENTATIVE HOW THEY'RE THEY'RE OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DELIVERING ANY GOODS- ON SALE THERE'S NO DRAFT AS YOUR BUSINESS AND RESTAURANTS RESTAURANTS JUST ARE LIMITED TO THE VOLUME THEY THEY'RE ABLE TO- TO SELL SO THEIR ONLY USING PACKAGE BEER. SO THE BREEZE LIKE SOME OF OURS THAT RELY DROP YOUR BUSINESS ANYWHERE FROM 3250% OF THE VOLUME. ARE LOSING OUT ON THE SALES. AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CONTRACT DURING PLANTS WHICH ARE BUSINESSES 90% CONTRACT BRINGS OUT OF IN ORDER ANY TRAFFIC THERE SO. THAT'S THAT'S USUALLY 30% DROP AND NOT THE PRETTY COMMON AMONGST THE- INDUSTRY. I WONDER THAT IN THE IN THE IMPACT OF THE RESTAURANT COLLEAGUES- AND I'M- STAYED IN CONTACT. WITH ALL MY ALL I CAN ALMOST RELATIONS IN THE REST BUSINESS LIMóN. YEAH THERE A LEAST THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE NEED THE MONEY. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SIT. OF UP ON IT. THE ONLY THING YOU DO THIS RIGHT BACK WHICH IS A TERM I FOR SINGLE RESTAURANT THERE. ARE THEN YOU HAVE OF THE GUY OPEN% CLOSE NOW DON'T THINK. ANYBODY IN THE SIX OF WAY. OR THE STATE SENATE OR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE REALIZES HOW PAINFUL AND EXPENSIVE IT IS TO TURN OFF AND OPEN THE FAUCET EVERY TIME. AND THESE RESTRICTIONS OUT OF GONE WHEN YOU HIRE YOUR STUFF BACK IN THE TRIGGERMAN PUT AN INVENTORY. WE'VE ALREADY WRITTEN OFF TO LOWER LAYERS OF INVENTORY IN THE INDUSTRY THAT'S UNSUSTAINABLE THEY'RE ALREADY OUT OF ACTION IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. THEY IN TURN YOU HAVE TO. PATTERSON GOT IS ANOTHER PROBLEM BECAUSE WHEN YOU START THIS OPENING CLOSING. IT'S A CHICKEN LITTLE AFFECTED NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IS WHAT WHAT YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO DO. AND THE LEADERSHIP IN SACRAMENTO IS GIVING INCONSISTENT MESSAGES THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE COVERAGE EXPERIENCE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S RIPPLING THROUGH THE TOURISM INDUSTRY. HOSPITALITY AND THEN PARTICULARLY IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. AND WHEN I'M REFERRING THE RESTAURANTS ON TALKING MORE OR LESS ABOUT FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS. THAT ARE THE HIGH PAYING JOBS THAT REPRESENT INCOME. NOT THIS FAST FOOD QUICK SERVE FIFTEEN DOLLAR AN HOUR POSITIONS. ARJUN ARE THE ONES THAT PEOPLE RELY ON FOR THEIR EFFORT TO MAKE A LIVING. SO THE ECONOMIC SHOCKS TREMENDOUS WHEN YOU HAVE THESE POSITIVE CASES. IF ONE PERSON IN YOUR STAFF TEST POSITIVE YOU'RE SHUTTING DOWN FOR THREE DAYS. AND THAT'S A BIG ISSUE AND A VERY COSTLY ONE FOR EVERY RESTAURANT THAT EXPERIENCE IS THAT. AND IT IT GENERALLY THE ODDS ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE PERSON ON YOUR STAFF. BUT I HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THATCOMING UP LATER ON. CORPORATION CANCEL ALL OTHER LARGE EVENTS- YOU DON'T HAVE. YOU HAVE COUNTY LEVEL GOVERNANCE THAT IS CONFLICTED. FOR INSTANCE AYE AYE WEBER IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY IT'S NOT OPEN. YEAH THE STATE SAYS IT CAN OPEN SO WHY. WHY CAN'T WE HAVE SOMETHING CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT. OUR OUR GOVERNMENTS TO ALLOW. FOR BUSINESSES TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO AN TO HAVE COMMON SENSE PREVAIL. WE HAVE TO WITH ALREADY CENTER THAT EMPLOYEES OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THEY ARE DECIDING THE FATE OF THE ENTIRE COUNTY RIGHT NOW. THAT'S TERRIBLE YEAH EVERYTHING ELSE SPORTING IN THE UNIVERSE OF VENUES ARE CLOSED STILL BARS. OF SPORTING BARS WERE BARS TV IMPERIAL. BARGER CLOSED WINERIES. PARK PARTIALLY OPEN ON SMALL BRIEF NO TASTING ROOMS THAT'S THE REVENUE. YOU GO DOWN THE WHOLE LIST IS JUST THE START OF A SCENARIO SO THERE'S NO OPTION IN THE DAY. FOR FULL SERVICE REST NOT TO RESTAURANT OWNER RIGHT THERE. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO TAKE THAT THAT PICTURE HOME. MONEY IS. YOU HAVE A CHOICE WILL CHOICES ARE BAY. OR THINKING BY WAY THANK. I'M REFERRING TO HOPING. THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME BECAUSE I'M NOT SCARED OFF FROM FROM PATRONIZING RESTAURANT THAT'S ALLOWED TO OPEN UP. FOR OR PUTTING IN SUCH RESTRICTIONS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OPEN. YOU ALSO LOOK AT ALL PROVIDING ART THAT'S A GREAT. SOLUTION UP UNTIL NOW. PSYCHOLOGICAL IN CALIFORNIA THE MINUTE RANGE PEOPLE STOPPING GOING OUT WITH CITY OUTSIDE TO GO TO A RESTAURANT. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO STAFF AN OUTDOOR DINING ONLY SCENARIO TO YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER'S GOING TO BE A- SCHEDULE THE PEOPLE SHOW UP AND START SPRINKLING. NOBODY SITS DOWN AND THEN HAVE THAT. LIKE I SAID EARLIER ONE CASE OF PROVIDENCE STAFF. IN THE BACK OF THE HOUSE FORCES RESTAURANT TO CLOSE SO- WELL IT'S HARD TO THIS ONE ALREADY THIS IS NOW DURING CERTAIN THE SCENARIO. ARE YOU HAVE A SKILLED GROUP OWNER PLUS ONE COOK IN THE SERVER. SO THIS WOULD BE A RESTAURANT TYPICALLY THAT HAS INTERIOR SEATING FOUR HUNDRED A HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE. AND NO LONGER HAVE THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH FALLOUT FOUR FIVE TABLES OUT OF THE PARKLAND. THEY HAVE A BILL THAT PARKER BY THE WAY. AND I AM READY BUILT PLEXIGLASS SHIELDING ON THEIR SEEDING. TO ALLOW FOR INDOOR DINING THAT WOULD SHUT DOWN. FIVE MONTHS AGO SO THEY WON'T SPEND A SMALL BUSINESS SPENDING ALREADY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THE REQUEST. OF THE GUIDELINES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN ABLE TO USE THAT SO IT'S SOMETHING MONEY. S. AND RECOVERABLE SO. 25% ENDORSING AREA. YOU STILL HAVE ONE KIRK ONE SERVER AND THERE'S CHANGE BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T. THE VOTES. TWENTY FIVE PER. IS TERRIBLE SO. CONSIDER THIS. 25% SEATING CAPACITY IS EQUIVALENT OF FLYING A SEVEN FORTY SEVEN WITH ONE ENGINE. IT'S GOING TO IT WON'T TAKE OFF BUT IT CERTAINLY CRASH. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GIVING US RIGHT NOW. IN IF YOU SURVEYS SOME OTHER STATES- PRINCES I CONTACT MY- COLLEAGUE FRIEND ONCE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED RESTAURANTS THAT ARE IN TWENTY FIVE STATES EAST. OF COLORADO. HE'S RUNNING AT 94% SALES LEVELS WITH 80% OCCUPANCY. NINE IF HE CAN DO THAT WHY. AREN'T THE- LEADERS OF CALIFORNIA MODELING OR GUIDELINES AFTER THEIR- THIS IS A DIRECT QUESTION AND THAT'S THE QUESTION I WANT YOU TO THINK BACK TO ALL YOUR COLLEAGUES IN STATE IF THE OTHER STATES CAN DO THIS PROPERLY SAFELY AND BE ABLE TO KEEP KEEP THE JOBS GOING AND YOU CAN WOULD CHICAGO. SUBURBS OF CHICAGO EVEN A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE RESTAURANTS ARE PACKED IN THERE NOT BANG EARLY. THEY REALLY ARE SO GIVE US 80% SEATING CAPACITY AND YOU'LL SEE 99% OF LOCATIONS OPEN LIKE MY BODY HAS BEEN IN THE EAST COAST. SO WHAT IS CALIFORNIA POLICY SO I'M LIKE OTHER STATES THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO. TAKE HOME TODAY THAT'S MIND MY WISH THERE'S A WE HEARD FROM TEACHERS THIS IS A TRUCK ON HIS FIRST TOP OF THE DAY. THAT TRUCK WOULD BEEN FULL IF WE HAD- 99% OF THE RESTAURANTS ON. TO RIGHT NOW I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED FROM THIS BECAUSE I HAD A ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT MY RESTAURANT CALLED. AND THIS IS WHY OF THE MINE WAS ON THE RIGHT. YEAH MCCORMACK AND SCHMIDT SERVICE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TEN ELEVEN LOCATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. THEY THEY YOU CAN BUY EITHER ONE OF THOSE FOR ZERO DOLLARS JUST ASSUME THE LEASE AND THE LANDLORD TO BE HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY. NOBODY WANTS TO OWN A RESTAURANT RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY THE FULL SERVICE CATEGORY. SO IT'S DEVASTATING HERE SOME WHAT YOU GUYS CAN DO TO HELP FIRST. WE NEED TO HAVE THE ABBOTT TEST PROVIDED FREE OR AND OF REALLY LOW SUBSIDIZE COSTS SO WE CAN TEST. THE INDIVIDUAL SERVERS AND BACK OF THE HEALTH PEOPLE BEFORE THEY ENTER THE RESTAURANT TO GO TO WORK. GIVE THEM THE FIFTEEN MINUTE ADVANCE THE COMMANDER SPIT IN THE CUP. IT'S ONLY 80% ACCURATE. BUT IT'S- 20% OF THAT INACCURACIES FALSE POSITIVES. THEN YOU CAN SEND THAT PERSON AFTER A FULL PC ARE ORIENTED TESTING FACILITY. AND GET THEM TESTED THOROUGHLY BUT THEY WON'T COME TO WORK AND COST CONTAINMENT. CROSS CONTAMINATE THE REST OF THE STAFF. DELIVERY SERVICES THIS A BIG DEAL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE BEEN PROGRAMMED INTO GRUBHUB UBER EATS AND OTHER OTHER VENUES. FOR DELIVERY SERVICES THEY'RE- RIPPING OFF THE RESTAURANT OWNERS. IF YOU GOT A CAPTAIN CAN GET IT BACK LATER ON WHEN WE GO INTO FOUR CONDOMINIUM OR MEANTIME. WE'RE YOU'RE GETTING FEES UP 2406% FROM SOMEONE LIKE ROB IT. OR DOORDASH IT'S TERRIBLE. ALL RIGHT THIS IS THE EASIER THING AND THIS IS FOR. SAKE CAL WITH AND SACRAMENTO IT'S THE MOST ABSURD THING IN THE WORLD YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST PAID RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES. RAKING IN MORE MONEY THE GUIDE TIPS THAN THEY EVER CARE ABOUT AN HOURLY WAGE. AND IF YOU GUARANTEE THEM TWENTY DOLLARS MINIMUM WAGE AT A GALLERY THAT'S REPORTED. TO THE STATE THEN THAT'S FINE THEN DO LET US CHARGE PAY THEM. SEVEN TO TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT NOT. NOT BE WE'RE WE'RE ONE OF SEVEN STATES IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE DON'T HAVE A TO CREDIT FORTY VERY OTHER STATES SEE THE LIGHT. AND IT'S REALLY DEVASTATING SO IF YOU WANT TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. GIVE SOME BREATHING ROOM TO THE RESTAURANT OWNERS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE BE ABLE TO COVER THOSE VARIABLE PASS AND THAT'S ALL TRYING TO DO. THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT CAN EVER BE ABLE TO CALL THE GOVERNOR FIX GLASS OVER THE NEXT EIGHT NINE MONTHS. UNTIL THERE'S A VACCINE. SO IN THE MEANTME LET US GET THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO GO OUT TO. EAT HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THAT ARE LOW RISK- INDIVIDUALS TO ENJOY THEIR LIVES. AND THE PERCENT OCCUPANCY LEVEL WILL BE FINE AND THEN START CHARGING THE EMPLOYER. PAYROLL TAXES FOR TIPS ON REVENUE OF MONEY. THAT THEY NEVER SEE. SO YOU HAVE TIPS CREDIT CARD FEES ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE- WE PAY TAXES ON. THE RESTAURATEUR THREE TAXES ON- THAT THEY DON'T EVER SEE RECEIVE MONEY FOR IS AN ADDED BURDEN COST. AND RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT RE OPENED WITH US. THE DOWNSIDE OF THE SALES WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE SALES VOLUME. CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS ARE DOWN THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. THAT THE LOT AND THIS IS AS OF OCTOBER IT'S RAMPING LITTLE BIT UP BUT IT'S MOSTLY IN THE QUICK SERVICE SECTOR. SO THE HIGH PAYING JOBS ARE NOT THERE FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO LEAVE AMERICA. MIND THREE FOUR TAKEAWAYS AND I'M SORRY DID WANT AN EXTRA ONE BUT- THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO COME BALLOTS BACK. AND THERE ARE A HUGE PART OF OUR ECONOMY IT'S OVER 10% OF THE CALIFORNIA PROPERTY. RIGHT THANKS. THANK YOU MISTER GORE. GREATER FROM. LOT DO. YEAH HALF OF IT YES. OKAY ARE LET PRESENT TODAY IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT RIDGE MALL HOSPITALITY. PATEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE I KEEP THIS BRIEF I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME. MY NAME IS AT THE TOWN AND THE CITY OF RIDGEMONT HOSPITALITY BASED IN OAKLAND WE ARE A FAMILY BUSINESS THAT STARTED FORTY YEARS AGO- IS WORKING AT THE FRONT DESK OF THE HOTEL AND WE CURRENTLY OWN SIX HOTELS. IN ALAMEDA AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY I ALSO SERVE AS A COMMISSIONER AND. PAST YEAR OF MUSIC CALIFORNIA. OUR HOTEL ARE LOCATED AS A MAIN HE'S CLARA ALAMEDA COUNTY WERE FOR TO SHUT DOWN AND LAST THREE OPEN. TO LEISURE TRAVELER THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN MOUNTED AGAINST US EARLY ON IN DEPEND ON ME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR FORTY YEAR HISTORY WE HAD TO CLOSE ALL BUT ONE HOTEL. WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY. OUR ENTIRE BUSINESS MAKING SOME VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS LIKE FOLLOWING OUR EMPLOYEES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO BRINGING EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM AS WE GRADUALLY COVER AND ALAMEDA COUNTY ALLOWS US TO OPEN FULLY. WE ARE NOW OPEN THE NEW SCREENING PROTOCOLS AND SAFETY PROCEDURES TO PROTECT OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND A HOTEL GUEST. SAFETY OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND OUR GUEST. HAS BECOME OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. OF THE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR JOB ECONOMY. IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY NINE POINT EIGHT BILLION WAS ON BY HOTELS. AT THE STATE LEVEL HOTELS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY HARD HIT WITH FOR OCCUPANCY BOTTOMING AT 21% BACK IN APRIL AND NOW HOW ARE YOU CAN JUST ABOVE 50% THE EARLY GLIMMERS OF RECOVERY HAVING VERY UNEVEN WITH URBAN AREAS LAGGING WAY BEHIND WILL REGION'S. WE JUST OPENED A NEW HOTEL IN DOWNTOWN OAKLAND SIX MONTHS GO AND THE COME THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT HOTEL BUSINESSES DECIMATED BECAUSE THERE ARE NO NEW NOPE INVENTIONS AND THAT IT'S NOT OPEN FOR BUSINESS. IN THE SAN% FRANCISCO BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE OUR OCCUPANCY RATES ARE DOWN SIDE DOWN BY 75% FOR US IN OUR DOWNTOWN OAKLAND HOTEL. OCCUPANCY IS EYEING LOW TWENTIES TO MID TEENS AND I BUSINESS IS DOWN BY 95% THE PANDEMIC HAS DEVASTATED CALIFORNIA'S TOURISM INDUSTRY ERASING TEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF GROWTH. THE REASON HE'S ONE OF THE MOST RESILIENT. ECONOMIC SECTORS AND IF TO RESERVE ANYTHING FOR ANY SIGNS. DURING CRISES IT'S VITAL. IT TOOK TWO YEARS LEFT FOR THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY TO RECOVER FROM THE GREAT RECESSION COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE ECONOMY. NOW WE ARE FACING LOSSES OF NEARLY EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS AND A TIMELINE DECLARING AT LEAST FOUR YEARS TO REBUILD THE INDUSTRY BACK TO WHERE WE WORK BE PAN AM. CALIFORNIANS CALIFORNIANS CAN SUPPORT OUR OWN ECONOMIC RECOVERY WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE. FALLING MANY OTHER PRICES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY INCLUDING NINE ELEVEN AND THE DESTRUCTIVE I LIFE. BY FIRE SEASONS OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS. THE TOURISM INDUSTRY WAS ABLE TO BAND TOGETHER THROUGH JOINT SB NATION PROMOTIONS TO BRING TRAVELERS BACK TO OUR STATE AND BILLS BACKED ECONOMIES. AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. I THINK THE BOARD AND THE MARKETING TEAM AT VISIT CALIFORNIA AND REALLY ALL OF OUR DESTINATION PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE RECOGNIZED TWO REASONS FOR OUR- TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES NOT JUST THAT HE DIDN'T SEND THE DISNEYLAND. BUT BUSINESSES LIKE MINE AND OTHER SMALL MOM AND POP SHOPS. CALIFORNIA'S WORK IS CRITICAL TO GROWING OUR TOURISM ECONOMY THAT IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA STRONG GUEST ECONOMIC ENGINES. WE KNOW THESE MARKETING PROGRAMS WORK WITH A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF INSPIRING TRAVELERS. WE GENERATED OR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN INCREMENTAL SPENDING IN THE STATE. STATE. NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND TOURISM BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE INVEST IN THESE MARKETING EFFORTS. A MARKETING THE NEW YORK REFERENDUM FAST JUST A YEAR LAST YEAR WITH 95% IN FAVOR THE HIGHEST APPROVAL RATINGS IN THE ORGANIZED SINCE THE ORGANIZATION WAS CONCEIVED. THAT MANDATE SHOWS INCREDIBLE UNITY BEHIND THE CALIFORNIA BRANCH THAT HAS BEEN BUILT AS WELL AS DATA THAT SUPPORTS HOW WELL THE MARKETING WORKS. CALIFORNIA'S TOURISM INDUSTRY HAS GIVENSO MUCH BACK TO THE STATE AS A WHOLE AND NOW IN OUR TIME OF NEED IT'S TIME FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO REINVEST INTO GETTING THIS INDUSTRY BACK ON ITS FEET. CALIFORNIA HOTELS ARE PREPARED WITH CLEAN AND SAFE PROCEDURES TO REVEAL INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS. THAT WILL RETURN THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES TO WORK WITH THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR A STATE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AND REPLENISH. MUNICIPAL COFFERS WITH MUCH NEEDED TAX REVENUE. OUR STATE SHOULD RE OPEN OUR HOTELS WITH INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS FOR MONTHS AFTER TO RESTORE ALLOWED TO RETURN WITHOUT INCIDENT. WE'VE BEEN OPERATING FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE ALL THE SAFETY MEASURES AND HAVE. YOU SEE GREAT SUCCESS. SO WHY NOT ALLOW THE MEETING SMALL MEETINGS TO COME BACK JUST LIKE WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY. THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL ON EMPLOYEES THEY INDUSTRY AND CD'S SOURCES I EMPLOYEES WANT TO COME BACK TO WORK DELEGATING FOR US TO START THE MEETING THE BANQUET. AND CATERING. CALIFORNIA HAS LOST TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND JOBS IN TWENTY TWENTY DIETED PLEA AS A RESULT OF LACK OF MEETINGS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EVERY MONTH MEETINGS ARE DELAYED CALIFORNIA WE LOSE FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. V. THIS THE LOSS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE LEADING TO OTHER DESTINATIONS WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR EMPLOYEES OUR HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AND OUR TAX REVENUES. CALIFORNIA HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION HAS ISSUED STATE WIDE GUIDELINES FOR INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS. SUPPORTED BY CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STANDARDS. CHML ISSUED IS CLEAN AND SEVEN GUIDELINES APRIL THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY. PROVIDING TIME FOR STATE HOTELS TO ESTABLISH A HEALTHY HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS JDM PLOYS AND THE CHOIR PROTECTIVE GEAR AND SANITARY EQUIPMENT. OUR STATE LODGING ASSOCIATION YOU ANY RIGHT PROVIDED FREE PP TWO HOTEL- OF MEMBERS WHO CAN'T OF FORTY THREE WAS A GREAT EFFORT ON CHIRLA. AND EACH GENERALLY. WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOME.

OTHER STATES ARE ABLE TO STAY FREE HOST MEETINGS INCLUDING DEFINITION CITIES LIKE ORLANDO DALLAS SEATTLE SAN ANTONIO AND LAS VEGAS WHICH RECENTLY APPROVED HOSTING MEETINGS UP TO ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. WE NEED CONSISTENT MESSAGING- GOING BACK TO. SENATOR CHIU ASKING THREE THINGS WE NEED TO SYNC CONSISTENT MESSAGING AYE DADDY AYE MY BUSINESS IS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND THEN THE STATE OF DECLARES ORANGE COUNTY DOESN'T COMPLY WITH THAT AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN RULE IT DOESN'T HELP IT DOESN'T HELP THE TRAVELERS AND YOU DON'T HEAR THE CONSISTENT MESSAGE AND THE MESSAGE THERE ARE STATE IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.
