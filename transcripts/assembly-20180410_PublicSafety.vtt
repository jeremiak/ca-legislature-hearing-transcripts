THIS INFORMATION SOMETIMES CAN

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:22.460 region:rollup2
BE CRUCIAL. ALMOND EXAMPLE WAS

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:24.596 region:rollup2
THE CHILD MOLEST CASE WHERE THE

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.863 region:rollup2

00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:28.266 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COUNTY.

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:30.668 region:rollup2
THE DEPENDENCY RECORDS WHEN I

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:41.179 region:rollup2
SO THESE RECORDS ON THEM ARAB

00:39:38.643 --> 00:39:43.748 region:rollup2

CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT. AND.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:56.661 region:rollup2
YOU DO NOT GET THEM IN A TIMELY

00:39:54.092 --> 00:39:58.196 region:rollup2

00:39:58.196 --> 00:40:01.866 region:rollup2

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:24.355 region:rollup2
SO.

00:40:22.654 --> 00:40:26.691 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE ARE WE TALKING

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:27.992 region:rollup2
ABOUT A TRIAL THAT THE JUVENILE

00:40:26.691 --> 00:40:30.295 region:rollup2
IS INVOLVED IN OR IS THIS

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:31.963 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE'S TRIAL WHERE THE

00:40:30.295 --> 00:40:34.132 region:rollup2
JUVENILE RECORD IS IMPORTANT.

00:40:31.963 --> 00:40:36.167 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE'S TRIAL WHERE THEIR

RELEVANT TO THE PROCEEDING.

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.939 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY WE GET A RELEASE

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:42.573 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE JUDGE.

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:44.342 region:rollup2
THE CRIMINAL TRIAL LAST RETAINS

SUSPECTED ASSAULT OF A CHILD IS

FAILURE TO REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:44:15.153 --> 00:44:17.622 region:rollup2
OF A CHILD IS A CONTINUING

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.157 region:rollup2
OFFENSE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:20.391 region:rollup2
BILL FIXES.

00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:21.759 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM THAT COMES FROM THIS

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.493 region:rollup2
WAS ACTUALLY DISCOVERED DURING

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:23.895 region:rollup2
THE LARRY NASSER CASE IN

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:27.164 region:rollup2
MICHIGAN.

00:44:23.895 --> 00:44:28.966 region:rollup2

ABUSE BY NASSER DID NOT REPORT

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:34.939 region:rollup2
AND THEY COULD NOT BE HELD

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:36.173 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE THE STATUE

00:44:34.939 --> 00:44:38.209 region:rollup2
OF LIMITATIONS HAD LONG SINCE

00:44:36.173 --> 00:44:40.444 region:rollup2

OTHER PEOPLE WHO SUSPECTED THAT

00:44:53.324 --> 00:44:56.360 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING TO THEM

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:57.762 region:rollup2
AND THEY DID NOTHING. WHAT THIS

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.530 region:rollup2
BILL DOES IS MAKE SURE THAT IN

00:44:57.762 --> 00:45:01.165 region:rollup2

AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN MENTIONED

00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:07.965 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT LAW IS THAT

00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:09.800 region:rollup2

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.289 region:rollup2
THIS FAILURE TO REPORT.

00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:33.658 region:rollup2
THIS IS IMPORTANT FROM A LAW

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:35.259 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE

00:46:33.658 --> 00:46:37.061 region:rollup2
AT TIMES CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:38.195 region:rollup2
CASES ARE NOT DISCOVERED IT IS

00:46:37.061 --> 00:46:39.830 region:rollup2
CLOSED UNTIL.

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:41.365 region:rollup2
SOMETIME LATER AND I'VE WORKED

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.667 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE SURVIVORS THAT ARE

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:43.601 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH A POLICE

00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:46.070 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIAL

00:46:43.601 --> 00:46:48.072 region:rollup2
PROSECUTION OF THEIR ABUSER. AND

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.840 region:rollup2
THAT THE REAL KEY IS THAT WE

00:46:48.072 --> 00:46:51.842 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT EARLY LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.643 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION IN THESE CASES

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:54.545 region:rollup2
HELPS TO PREVENT FURTHER

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:56.247 region:rollup2
VICTIMIZATION NOT ONLY OF THAT

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:57.548 region:rollup2
SURVIVOR BUT OF ANY OTHER

00:46:56.247 --> 00:46:58.916 region:rollup2
VICTIMS.

00:46:57.548 --> 00:47:00.985 region:rollup2
IF WE GET INVOLVED WE CAN

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:02.320 region:rollup2
INITIATE INVESTIGATION AND HOLD

00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:03.754 region:rollup2
THE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABLE.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.323 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:08.926 region:rollup2
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

00:47:05.323 --> 00:47:12.530 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ABUSE.

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:14.865 region:rollup2
OKAY.

HAVE TO LOOK TO LARRY NASSER WE

00:47:45.496 --> 00:47:49.433 region:rollup2
CAN LOOK TO COUNTY OUR OWN CASES

00:47:47.198 --> 00:47:52.370 region:rollup2
WITHIN OUR COUNTY. TO REALIZE

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:53.938 region:rollup2
THAT THE LAW IS COMING UP SHORT.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:56.107 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE MANDATORY

00:47:53.938 --> 00:47:57.641 region:rollup2
REPORTERS IN THE LAW FORCES THEM

00:47:56.107 --> 00:47:59.176 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THAT

00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:00.010 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN AND THE CLOSE CONTACT

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:02.279 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE WITH YOUNG

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:04.248 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. CAN SEE THINGS AND

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:07.051 region:rollup2
NOTIFY AUTHORITIES WHEN THEY

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:08.686 region:rollup2
KNOW SOMETHING IS GOING ON AND

00:48:07.051 --> 00:48:11.522 region:rollup2
THEY FAILED TO DO THAT.

00:48:08.686 --> 00:48:13.390 region:rollup2
AND THEN FIVE YEARS GOES BY AND

00:48:11.522 --> 00:48:15.593 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON WHO FAILED TO REPORT

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:17.194 region:rollup2
THAT YOUNG CHILD CONTINUES TO BE

00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:19.063 region:rollup2
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IN MOLESTED

00:48:17.194 --> 00:48:20.698 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER AND OVER. FOR

00:48:19.063 --> 00:48:22.500 region:rollup2
YEARS TO COME.

00:48:20.698 --> 00:48:24.034 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BENEFIT

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.970 region:rollup2
FROM THE CAR. AND CURRENT LAW.

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:28.105 region:rollup2
A WEEK HAVE CASES THAT THAT HAS

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:29.707 region:rollup2
EXACTLY OCCURRED AND WE CANNOT

PROSECUTE THAT PERSON.

00:48:29.707 --> 00:48:33.077 region:rollup2
NOW SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES ARE

00:48:31.442 --> 00:48:34.745 region:rollup2
UNIQUE IN A SITUATION.

00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:37.314 region:rollup2
IT IN A UNIQUE SITUATION

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:38.582 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY CAN OCCUR OVER LONG

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:40.017 region:rollup2
PERIODS OF TIME.

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:43.053 region:rollup2
AND THE CURRENT LAW.

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:44.588 region:rollup2
DOES NOT PROTECT THOSE KIDS IF

00:48:43.053 --> 00:48:46.590 region:rollup2
THE MOLESTATION STARTS IN

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:49.293 region:rollup2

GOING ON. AND FAILED TO PROTECT

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:03.140 region:rollup2

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:11.081 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE TEETH. AND AND

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:12.450 region:rollup2
ALLOW THOSE PEOPLE TO DO WHAT WE

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:14.885 region:rollup2
WANNA DO IS.

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:44.775 region:rollup2
IN CASES REGARDING AN OMISSION

SUCH AS A FAILURE TO REPORT IT

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:48.178 region:rollup2
CAN BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.380 region:rollup2
A DEFENDANT. TO BE ABLE TO

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:50.814 region:rollup2
CONTEST THE CHARGES Y. MEMORIES

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.750 region:rollup2

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:54.318 region:rollup2
I ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT JOBS

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.586 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HELD FIVE YEARS AGO OR

00:50:54.318 --> 00:50:59.557 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS AGO.

00:50:55.586 --> 00:51:00.658 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT AN INCIDENT THAT.

00:50:59.557 --> 00:51:02.693 region:rollup2
TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT KIND OF

00:51:00.658 --> 00:51:04.495 region:rollup2
INFORMATION YOU HAD WHAT YOU DID

00:51:02.693 --> 00:51:06.664 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT INFORMATION CAN BE

00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:07.765 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT AT THAT DISTANCE

00:51:06.664 --> 00:51:10.067 region:rollup2
YOU MAY HAVE MOVED ON TO ANOTHER

00:51:07.765 --> 00:51:11.402 region:rollup2
JOB. YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE

RECORDS FROM THAT FIRST JOB THAT

00:51:11.402 --> 00:51:14.838 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE

00:51:13.037 --> 00:51:16.507 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PROSECUTING FOR

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:19.043 region:rollup2
THEIR FAILURES TO REPORT I THINK

00:51:16.507 --> 00:51:20.277 region:rollup2
UP PUTS. MANDATED REPORTERS IN A

00:51:19.043 --> 00:51:22.146 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT POSITION.

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:23.948 region:rollup2
THE DEFENDANT MAY HAVE

00:51:22.146 --> 00:51:25.849 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY REMEMBERING WHAT HE

00:51:23.948 --> 00:51:28.352 region:rollup2
OR SHE DID HIT DID OR DIDN'T

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:30.721 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT AN INCIDENT OF ABUSE.

00:51:28.352 --> 00:51:31.755 region:rollup2
OR WHAT THEY MAY HAVE DONE TO

00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:33.557 region:rollup2
TRY TO REPORT THEIR THERE ARE

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:34.959 region:rollup2
CASES IN WHICH PEOPLE DO DO

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:36.760 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO REPORT THE ABUSE

00:51:34.959 --> 00:51:38.729 region:rollup2
AND.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.365 region:rollup2
PROBE FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT

00:51:38.729 --> 00:51:41.899 region:rollup2
REPORT GETS GETS LOST IN IN

00:51:41.365 --> 00:51:43.567 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION.

00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:45.035 region:rollup2
.

00:51:43.567 --> 00:51:46.437 region:rollup2
THAT PUTS THE PERSON IN THE

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:47.338 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE IT ALL BUT

00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:50.174 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEST THE

00:51:47.338 --> 00:51:51.742 region:rollup2
PROSECUTION'S VERSION OF EVENTS.

00:51:50.174 --> 00:51:53.243 region:rollup2
FROM A FAIRNESS STANDPOINT AT

00:51:51.742 --> 00:51:54.478 region:rollup2
SOME POINT INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:56.180 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BE SECURE IN THE

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:56.680 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL NOT

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.582 region:rollup2
BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.149 region:rollup2
PROSECUTION FOR SOMETHING THAT

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:01.986 region:rollup2
HAPPENED. UP MANY MANY YEARS

00:51:59.149 --> 00:52:03.354 region:rollup2
AGO.

00:52:01.986 --> 00:52:05.289 region:rollup2
MANDATE REPORTERS OF PEOPLE IN

00:52:03.354 --> 00:52:06.824 region:rollup2
HELPING PROFESSIONS PEOPLE SUCH

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:08.559 region:rollup2
AS TEACHERS WHO HAVE DEVOTED

00:52:06.824 --> 00:52:09.960 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES TO HELPING CHILDREN.

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:11.729 region:rollup2
I THINK SUBJECTING THEM TO

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.731 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL CRIMINAL PROSECUTION

00:52:11.729 --> 00:52:15.366 region:rollup2
FOR A FAILURE TO REPORT AND WE

00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:16.800 region:rollup2
ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT.

00:52:15.366 --> 00:52:19.937 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL CONCEALMENT THAT

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:21.839 region:rollup2
ALREADY IS A CONTINUING OFFENSE.

00:52:19.937 --> 00:52:23.540 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:26.410 region:rollup2
FAILURE TO REPORT.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:28.245 region:rollup2
I IT IT MAKES THOSE JOBS HARDER

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:30.247 region:rollup2
AND IT PUTS THOSE PEOPLE IN A

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:31.982 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE.

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:33.317 region:rollup2
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:34.418 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY

00:52:33.317 --> 00:52:35.919 region:rollup2

I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THIS BILL

00:53:00.477 --> 00:53:02.913 region:rollup2

MISDEMEANOR.

ABOUT OUR AWARD WINNING PUBLIC

00:53:14.992 --> 00:53:18.228 region:rollup2
SCHOOL TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA. I

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.531 region:rollup2
WAS MINDFUL OF HOW THEY SHOULD

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:22.1000 region:rollup2
BE ON FAIR NOTICE THIS BILL IS

00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:24.301 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE SO GOING BACK TWENTY

00:53:22.1000 --> 00:53:25.602 region:rollup2
YEARS WILL NOT HAPPEN IT'S THAT

00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:27.237 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THOSE PROFESSIONS

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:28.005 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE NOTICED THAT GOING

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:29.239 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

00:53:28.005 --> 00:53:30.874 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THIS AND AND I JUST

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:32.910 region:rollup2
THINK MORE OF TEACHERS THAT THEY

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:34.945 region:rollup2
WON'T TRY NOT TO KNOW. ABOUT HOW

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:36.313 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT KIDS. TEACHERS WANT

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:37.815 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT KIDS THIS IS WHAT

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:39.483 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO DO THEY THEY DON'T

00:53:37.815 --> 00:53:40.417 region:rollup2
WANT TO TURN A BLIND EYE THEY. I

00:53:39.483 --> 00:53:41.885 region:rollup2
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT IS AN

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:42.853 region:rollup2
ATTITUDE THAT WOULD KEEP PEOPLE

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:44.922 region:rollup2
FROM ENTERING THE PROFESSION OR

00:53:42.853 --> 00:53:45.556 region:rollup2
EVEN DOING THE PROFESSION TO THE

00:53:44.922 --> 00:53:46.223 region:rollup2
BEST THEIR ABILITY IN PROTECTING

00:53:45.556 --> 00:53:47.257 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:48.592 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I THINK IT'S VERY

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:50.294 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT REMEMBER THIS IS A ONE

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:51.829 region:rollup2
YEAR STATURE LIMITATIONS WERE

00:53:50.294 --> 00:53:52.896 region:rollup2
NOT CHANGING THAT. THE

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:54.098 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANCE IS IN MANY OF THOSE

00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:57.201 region:rollup2
CASES WHERE THERE'S CONCERN

00:53:54.098 --> 00:53:57.668 region:rollup2
ABOUT STALE EVIDENCE THERE'S A

00:53:57.201 --> 00:53:58.001 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR STATUTE OF

00:53:57.668 --> 00:53:59.803 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS.

00:53:58.001 --> 00:54:01.205 region:rollup2
AND THIS ONE WILL KICK IN WHEN A

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:02.673 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT FINDS OUT TO

00:54:01.205 --> 00:54:04.208 region:rollup2
THEY STILL HAVE TO GET IT DONE

00:54:02.673 --> 00:54:05.976 region:rollup2
WITHIN ONE YEAR.

00:54:04.208 --> 00:54:07.377 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

00:54:05.976 --> 00:54:08.612 region:rollup2
THAT WE FOCUS THIS BILL THIS WAY

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:10.013 region:rollup2

TWENTY FOUR SIXTY TWO. THIS BILL

00:55:23.787 --> 00:55:27.191 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE A JUDGE OR

HAS BEEN STRANGLED OR SUFFOCATED

00:55:31.128 --> 00:55:34.164 region:rollup2

STRANGULATION.

00:55:53.483 --> 00:55:56.453 region:rollup2
THIS IS DUE THE FACT THAT MANY

A PERSON CAN BECOME BRAINDEAD.

00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:13.637 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY STRANGULATION MAY

00:56:12.336 --> 00:56:16.073 region:rollup2

00:58:22.399 --> 00:58:25.168 region:rollup2

THE CRIME.

00:58:27.738 --> 00:58:31.208 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION OF

00:58:29.406 --> 00:58:32.776 region:rollup2
THOSE QUESTIONS IS THAT TRULY

00:58:31.208 --> 00:58:34.511 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC.

APPRECIATE THE DANGER PRESENTED

BY A DEFENDANT.

00:58:38.382 --> 00:58:41.551 region:rollup2
ASSESSING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:42.953 region:rollup2
CRIME SIMILARLY REQUIRES A JUDGE

00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:45.489 region:rollup2
TO TRULY APPRECIATE HOW SERIOUS

00:58:42.953 --> 00:58:47.758 region:rollup2

DIFFERENT.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.203 region:rollup2

DON'T RESULT IN ARRESTS. AND IN

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:51.180 region:rollup2

MOTORCYCLE PROFOUND SURVEY SAYS

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:56.786 region:rollup2
THAT FORTY SIX PERCENT OF

YOU NOW CSUS.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.404 region:rollup2
I THINK CORRECTLY POINTS OUT.

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:03.639 region:rollup2
PROFILING IS THIS NOTION IS

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:04.640 region:rollup2
BEING DESCRIBED IS ALREADY

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:06.842 region:rollup2
PROHIBITED.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.676 region:rollup2
IF NOT BY STATUTE CERTAINLY BY

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:10.012 region:rollup2
CASE LAW.

01:24:07.676 --> 01:24:11.446 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LONG LINE OF CASE LAW

01:24:10.012 --> 01:24:14.616 region:rollup2
THAT INDICATES THAT AN OFFICER

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:17.052 region:rollup2
MUST BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE.

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:21.290 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC FACTS TO JUSTIFY A

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:21.657 region:rollup2
STOPPER TENSION. UM DESSES NOT

01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:24.359 region:rollup2
NEW OR.

01:24:21.657 --> 01:24:27.462 region:rollup2
MYSTIFYING CONCEPT.

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:28.096 region:rollup2
IT SO IT'S UNCLEAR HOW.

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:31.333 region:rollup2
MAKING SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:33.335 region:rollup2
LEGAL. MORE ILLEGAL WILL STOP

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:34.870 region:rollup2
ANY SORT OF PERCEIVED BEHAVIOR

01:24:33.335 --> 01:24:36.204 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING ON.

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:36.772 region:rollup2
A I THINK WE'RE CONCERNED THAT

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:47.849 region:rollup2
THIS BILL GOES FURTHER THAN

01:24:36.772 --> 01:24:48.517 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:49.184 region:rollup2
AND AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES DID

01:24:48.517 --> 01:24:49.418 region:rollup2
POINT OUT IT CREATES A SITUATION

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:50.085 region:rollup2
WHERE.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:50.752 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS SORT OF

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.420 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD PREVENT

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:51.853 region:rollup2
AN OFFICER FROM ENGAGING WITH A

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.421 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL SUSPECT.

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:52.955 region:rollup2
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.588 region:rollup2
PULLING SOMEONE OVER ON A

01:24:52.955 --> 01:24:54.222 region:rollup2
MOTORCYCLE BECAUSE THEY'RE ON A

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:56.158 region:rollup2
MOTORCYCLE BUT IN A SITUATION.

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:58.393 region:rollup2
WHERE AN OFFICER IS PATROLLING

01:24:56.158 --> 01:24:58.961 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD AND GETS A CALL?

01:24:58.393 --> 01:24:59.861 region:rollup2
AGAIN AS THE WITNESS POINTED

01:24:58.961 --> 01:25:01.229 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:03.031 region:rollup2
THAT A BANK HAS BEEN ROBBED AND

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:05.467 region:rollup2
THAT THE SUSPECT WAS SEEN

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:06.835 region:rollup2
FLEEING ON A MOTORCYCLE.

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:08.437 region:rollup2
IN THIS CONTEXT IT'S UNCLEAR

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:10.872 region:rollup2
WHAT ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALIZED

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:13.108 region:rollup2
SUSPICION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:14.943 region:rollup2
IF YOU SAW A MOTORCYCLE SPEEDING

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:16.678 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:18.046 region:rollup2
MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION IS THAT

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:19.982 region:rollup2
ENOUGH INDIVIDUALIZED SUSPICION

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:21.683 region:rollup2
TO JUSTIFY A STOP AND IF IT'S

01:25:19.982 --> 01:25:22.851 region:rollup2
NOT THEN YOU HAVE AN OFFICER

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:23.952 region:rollup2
SECOND GUESSING A SITUATION.

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:25.487 region:rollup2
WHO KNOWS WHERE THAT PERSON IS

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:26.555 region:rollup2
HEADING NEXT?

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:27.956 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN IT IT SUBJECTS AN

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:29.324 region:rollup2
OFFICER TO AN AMBIGUOUS SORT OF

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:31.360 region:rollup2
STANDARDS OUTSIDE OF WHAT

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:32.694 region:rollup2
STATUTE CASE LAW AND THE STATE

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.397 region:rollup2
AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:36.932 region:rollup2
REQUIRE. A IN TERMS OF WAYS TO

01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:39.234 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH ANYTHING THAT COULD BE

01:25:36.932 --> 01:25:40.936 region:rollup2
PERCEIVED AS AN UNLAWFUL SEARCH.

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:43.071 region:rollup2
IMPEDING POLICE WORK ON THE

01:25:40.936 --> 01:25:43.705 region:rollup2
FRONT AND WILL CREATE RISK TO

01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:44.473 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY AND WERE POSTED.

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:46.541 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:47.843 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SIR.

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:49.578 region:rollup2
OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

01:25:47.843 --> 01:25:51.813 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

01:25:49.578 --> 01:25:53.815 region:rollup2
UP ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:55.250 region:rollup2
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:56.852 region:rollup2
LACKEY CERTAINLY.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:58.253 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:25:56.852 --> 01:25:59.388 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT OF THE BILLS IN

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:00.756 region:rollup2
MARYLAND WASHED AND THEY'RE BOTH

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:02.290 region:rollup2
TRAINING BILLS AND THEY HAVE

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:03.825 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO DO WITH SUING LONG

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:05.127 region:rollup2
FORSMAN OFFICERS.

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.328 region:rollup2
SO SO MUCH DIFFERENT BILL IN

01:26:05.127 --> 01:26:08.563 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THOSE.

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:09.064 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER THING I WOULD

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:09.564 region:rollup2
LIKE TO CONFIRM IS THAT.

01:26:09.064 --> 01:26:11.833 region:rollup2
.

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:13.902 region:rollup2
FOR ANY.

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:16.672 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT OR ANY UNFAIR

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:18.440 region:rollup2
PROFILING. AS WAS POINTED OUT BY

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:20.175 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION WITNESS.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.343 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT OKAY.

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:22.611 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT OKAY AS IT CURRENTLY

01:26:21.343 --> 01:26:24.646 region:rollup2
STANDS.

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:26.014 region:rollup2
AND AS A FORMER SUPERVISOR OF A

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:26.815 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY FOR

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:28.650 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN IN MY TWENTY EIGHT

01:26:26.815 --> 01:26:29.685 region:rollup2
YEARS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:31.186 region:rollup2
TAKE THOSE ALLEGATIONS VERY

01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:32.788 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY.

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:35.290 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE FULLY INVESTIGATED

01:26:32.788 --> 01:26:36.892 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE. OF DIRT THERE'S

01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:38.694 region:rollup2
PUNITIVE ACTION TAKEN IF THERE

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:39.494 region:rollup2
IS AN INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR ON

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:41.229 region:rollup2
THE PART OF THE OFFICER.

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:43.065 region:rollup2
SO.

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:45.600 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THIS BILL.

01:26:43.065 --> 01:26:46.068 region:rollup2
IS MISGUIDED AND I I THINK THAT

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.235 region:rollup2
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT.

01:26:46.068 --> 01:26:49.004 region:rollup2
.

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:50.772 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A ROAD IN OUR CONFIDENCE

01:26:49.004 --> 01:26:52.274 region:rollup2
BUT WE WE HAVE WORK TO DO IN

01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:53.608 region:rollup2
BUILDING. TRUST BETWEEN OUR LAW

01:26:52.274 --> 01:26:54.776 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THOSE

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:56.745 region:rollup2
WHO WERE.

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:58.713 region:rollup2
FEELING THAT THEY'RE BEING

01:26:56.745 --> 01:27:02.551 region:rollup2
UNFAIRLY PROFILE.

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:04.186 region:rollup2
THANK.

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:05.220 region:rollup2
QUIRK SO WE CAN. I KNOW THIS

01:27:04.186 --> 01:27:07.255 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.390 region:rollup2
HE WILL.

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:10.225 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S IN NINETY EIGHT

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:11.259 region:rollup2
PERCENT CHANCE TO VETO THE BILL

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:12.794 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT MAKES SOMETHING

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:14.229 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL THE CHARTIER LEGAL

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:15.430 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.698 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:17.833 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO THINK

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:20.035 region:rollup2
ABOUT A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:22.671 region:rollup2
THIS TRAINING WOULD BE ONE.

01:27:20.035 --> 01:27:23.438 region:rollup2
GATHERING STATISTICS ON HOW

01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:25.373 region:rollup2
OFTEN.

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:27.209 region:rollup2
MOTORCYCLISTS ARE STOPPED

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:30.245 region:rollup2
VERSUS HOW OFTEN THEIR CITED

01:27:27.209 --> 01:27:31.546 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO. AUTOS IS ANOTHER

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:34.249 region:rollup2
APPROACH YOU MIGHT TAKE.

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:35.884 region:rollup2
BUT THE IBM AGAIN I THINK THIS

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:37.786 region:rollup2
IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I

01:27:35.884 --> 01:27:39.387 region:rollup2
AGREE A HUNDRED PERCENT WITHOUT

01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:42.157 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORTERS THAT IT IS AN

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:44.025 region:rollup2
ISSUE. I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT

01:27:42.157 --> 01:27:45.594 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:47.229 region:rollup2
THIS PASSED INTO LAW.

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:50.565 region:rollup2
TO GET NOW BE VOTING AYE.

01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:51.733 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:53.101 region:rollup2
YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:54.169 region:rollup2

01:59:32.666 --> 01:59:33.800 region:rollup2
IN THIS BILL SORT OF.

01:59:33.133 --> 01:59:34.401 region:rollup2
JUST GLOSSES OVER THE FACT THAT

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:34.601 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENS NUMBER ONE NUMBER

01:59:34.401 --> 01:59:35.668 region:rollup2
TWO.

01:59:34.601 --> 01:59:37.504 region:rollup2
THE BILL'S LANGUAGE I THINK IS A

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:39.773 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT TOO RESTRICTIVE IN.

01:59:37.504 --> 01:59:41.408 region:rollup2
THE CONTEXT OF MANDATING THAT A

01:59:39.773 --> 01:59:42.509 region:rollup2
GROUP BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO A

01:59:41.408 --> 01:59:43.910 region:rollup2
FACILITY SO THE SHERIFF HAS

01:59:42.509 --> 01:59:45.645 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARE AND

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:46.479 region:rollup2
CUSTODY OF THE INMATES. ARE BUT

01:59:45.645 --> 01:59:48.348 region:rollup2
ALSO FOR THE SAFETY OF THE

01:59:46.479 --> 01:59:49.949 region:rollup2
FACILITY AND STAFF AND THE BILL

01:59:48.348 --> 01:59:51.584 region:rollup2
SAYS IN ITS OWN WORDS BUT AT

01:59:49.949 --> 01:59:53.953 region:rollup2
LEAST ONE GROUP MAIN MUST BE

01:59:51.584 --> 01:59:56.056 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO ENTER TO PERFORM THIS

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:57.924 region:rollup2
VOTER EDUCATION. SO IN A STRICT

01:59:56.056 --> 01:59:59.492 region:rollup2
READING OF THE LANGUAGE OF ONLY

01:59:57.924 --> 02:00:01.528 region:rollup2
ONE GROUP WERE TO COME FORWARD

01:59:59.492 --> 02:00:03.596 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE THE

02:00:01.528 --> 02:00:05.465 region:rollup2
SHERIFF IS OSTENSIBLY OBLIGATED

02:00:03.596 --> 02:00:06.1000 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW THAT PARTICULAR GROUP

02:00:05.465 --> 02:00:08.902 region:rollup2
BEEN. IT DOESN'T TAKE ANY

02:00:06.1000 --> 02:00:10.704 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL SAFETY

02:00:08.902 --> 02:00:12.305 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT

02:00:10.704 --> 02:00:12.772 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR GROUP THAT SEEKING

02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:13.640 region:rollup2
ENTRY TO PROVIDE VOTER

02:00:12.772 --> 02:00:15.809 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:16.976 region:rollup2
THE BILL IS SILENT ON ANY SORT

02:00:15.809 --> 02:00:18.545 region:rollup2
OF AUTHORITY THAT THE SHERIFF

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:19.546 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE.

02:00:18.545 --> 02:00:20.880 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE

02:00:19.546 --> 02:00:22.282 region:rollup2
FACILITIES WE THINK AT THE VERY

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:24.451 region:rollup2
LEAST THOSE TWO THINGS NEED TO

02:00:22.282 --> 02:00:24.884 region:rollup2
BE IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL OR

02:00:24.451 --> 02:00:26.252 region:rollup2
RELEASED REFERENCE.

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:28.321 region:rollup2
.

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:29.489 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT IT IT'S JUST I THINK

02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:30.256 region:rollup2
TOO STRICT IN THE LANGUAGE I

02:00:29.489 --> 02:00:33.026 region:rollup2
THINK THERE MIGHT BE A WAY

02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:34.394 region:rollup2
FORWARD BUT THE WAY THE BILL IS

02:00:33.026 --> 02:00:35.161 region:rollup2
TODAY WE'D ASK YOU KNOW WELL.

ALREADY THAT'S EASY TO DO YOU

02:00:58.151 --> 02:01:02.088 region:rollup2
COULD PUT THAT IN THE FINDINGS.

02:00:59.486 --> 02:01:05.024 region:rollup2

MUSLIM.

02:01:12.499 --> 02:01:15.902 region:rollup2
SO IN LA ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:17.137 region:rollup2

THERE'S A BACK ON CLEARANCE

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:21.474 region:rollup2

02:01:20.173 --> 02:01:23.810 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THEY CONDUCT

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:25.678 region:rollup2
SO THEY DO A CUSTODY US SUPPORT

02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:27.680 region:rollup2
TRAINING THEY ALSO DO A A VERY

02:01:25.678 --> 02:01:29.482 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND. CHECK

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:31.484 region:rollup2

MONTHS FOR SOMETIMES A CLEARANCE

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:34.788 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO BE DONE BUT ONCE THEY

02:01:34.788 --> 02:01:37.857 region:rollup2
HAVE ENTRY INSIDE. TO THE JAIL

02:01:36.256 --> 02:01:39.025 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AND WE HAVE WORKED

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:40.126 region:rollup2
VERY WELL WITH THE LA SHERIFF'S

02:01:39.025 --> 02:01:42.395 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AT LEAST IN THAT

02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:44.063 region:rollup2
PROCESS. YET BUT SO. DO YOU HAVE

02:01:42.395 --> 02:01:45.698 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WHERE IT DOESN'T WORK

02:01:44.063 --> 02:01:47.500 region:rollup2
WELL WHAT IS THE NEED FOR THE

02:01:45.698 --> 02:01:48.935 region:rollup2
BILL BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S. IN

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:50.904 region:rollup2
BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD.

02:01:48.935 --> 02:01:52.605 region:rollup2

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:55.575 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WHERE YOU HAVE

02:01:53.373 --> 02:01:56.976 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY. AND WHERE THE

02:01:55.575 --> 02:02:00.814 region:rollup2
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT YOU DO NOT

02:01:56.976 --> 02:02:01.714 region:rollup2
THINK IS DOING AN ADEQUATE JOB.

02:02:00.814 --> 02:02:03.783 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF GETTING THE

02:02:01.714 --> 02:02:05.285 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION I I THINK THAT'S

02:02:03.783 --> 02:02:06.352 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE IMPORTANT ISSUE

02:02:05.285 --> 02:02:07.720 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AS YOU GO TO THE

02:02:06.352 --> 02:02:09.756 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:11.191 region:rollup2
HE'S ALWAYS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:02:09.756 --> 02:02:11.758 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE THANK YOU FOR THE

02:02:11.191 --> 02:02:13.493 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:02:11.758 --> 02:02:15.128 region:rollup2
WE ARE SEEING VERY INCONSISTENT

02:02:13.493 --> 02:02:17.297 region:rollup2
PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE IN

02:02:15.128 --> 02:02:19.265 region:rollup2
FACT JUST A AN ADJOINING.

02:02:17.297 --> 02:02:20.800 region:rollup2
COUNTY TO LA THEIR VERY

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:21.734 region:rollup2
DIFFERING POLICIES IN FACT TWO

02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:24.003 region:rollup2
OF THE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES HAVE

02:02:21.734 --> 02:02:25.672 region:rollup2
OPPOSING POLICIES WHICH ADD TO

02:02:24.003 --> 02:02:27.207 region:rollup2
THE CONFUSION IN TERMS OF VOTING

02:02:25.672 --> 02:02:29.042 region:rollup2
RIGHTS AND VOTING ELIGIBILITY

02:02:27.207 --> 02:02:31.344 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO VOTING PROCESSES INSIDE

02:02:29.042 --> 02:02:32.679 region:rollup2
THE FACILITIES. SO THIS BILL I

02:02:31.344 --> 02:02:34.747 region:rollup2
THINK WOULD ALLOW FOR STANDARD

02:02:32.679 --> 02:02:36.082 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT

02:02:34.747 --> 02:02:38.151 region:rollup2
YES THE RIGHT INFORMATION IS

02:02:36.082 --> 02:02:39.018 region:rollup2
BEING PROVIDED IN THE PROCESS

02:02:38.151 --> 02:02:40.787 region:rollup2
HE'S ARE CONSISTENT.

02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:41.921 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BEEN AND SO I THINK

02:02:40.787 --> 02:02:44.224 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE THAT THAT'S THE

02:02:41.921 --> 02:02:44.858 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF THE OF THE BILL THANK

02:02:44.224 --> 02:02:46.659 region:rollup2

MOVED THE BILL.

02:02:48.628 --> 02:02:52.999 region:rollup2
SECOND.

IS.

02:02:56.402 --> 02:03:00.540 region:rollup2
A MASTERS PROGRAM THIS IS THIS

02:02:58.638 --> 02:03:02.175 region:rollup2
WILL COME ALONG ANY EXISTING

02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:03.877 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT EXIST I'M I THINK

02:03:02.175 --> 02:03:04.878 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:03:03.877 --> 02:03:07.046 region:rollup2
TRY TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS

02:03:04.878 --> 02:03:08.882 region:rollup2
ONE. UNDERSTAND THOSE WHO ARE

02:03:07.046 --> 02:03:10.183 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE TO VOTE HAVE AN

02:03:08.882 --> 02:03:11.017 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO ONE RICHARD

02:03:10.183 --> 02:03:11.451 region:rollup2
OPPONENT ALSO EXERCISE THEIR

02:03:11.017 --> 02:03:12.619 region:rollup2
VOTE.

02:03:11.451 --> 02:03:14.120 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO DO VOTER

02:03:12.619 --> 02:03:15.855 region:rollup2
SUPPRESSION THIS IS VOTER

02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:16.422 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

02:03:15.855 --> 02:03:18.358 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS ALREADY WORKING

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:19.792 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW AND CERTAINLY THE

02:03:18.358 --> 02:03:21.527 region:rollup2
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AMID A FINE

02:03:19.792 --> 02:03:23.096 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION NOT FIT TO COME IN

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:24.731 region:rollup2
FOR SECURITY REASONS.

02:03:23.096 --> 02:03:26.299 region:rollup2
THEN WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK FOR

02:03:24.731 --> 02:03:28.067 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT MEETS

02:03:26.299 --> 02:03:29.736 region:rollup2
THE CRITERIA AND MEETS

02:03:28.067 --> 02:03:31.437 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABILITY OF THE SHERIFF'S

02:03:29.736 --> 02:03:32.605 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT BUT AGAIN IT THIS IS

02:03:31.437 --> 02:03:34.641 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:03:32.605 --> 02:03:36.509 region:rollup2
DIRECTION. WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING

02:03:34.641 --> 02:03:38.311 region:rollup2
ON AND LOOKING FOR THOSE

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:40.313 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS TO GET TO MAINSTREAM

02:03:38.311 --> 02:03:41.614 region:rollup2
THEM BACK INTO SOCIETY AND I

02:03:40.313 --> 02:03:44.417 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT THING

02:03:41.614 --> 02:03:46.052 region:rollup2
TO DO BY PROVIDING. WITH THEM

WHERE VIOLENCE MAY HAPPEN.

02:09:00.933 --> 02:09:03.970 region:rollup2

02:15:24.483 --> 02:15:26.752 region:rollup2
DEMANDED SHE SPEAKING ENGLISH

AND ASKED WHETHER SHE HAD A

02:15:26.752 --> 02:15:29.154 region:rollup2
GREEN CARD.

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:30.489 region:rollup2
THEY ARRESTED HER RATHER THAN

02:15:29.154 --> 02:15:31.724 region:rollup2
HER ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND EVEN

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:33.125 region:rollup2
THOUGH SHE HAD BRUISES ON HER

ARREST AT THE HOSPITAL A DOCTOR

02:15:38.864 --> 02:15:41.166 region:rollup2
EXAMINED HER FOUND BRUISES AND

02:15:40.399 --> 02:15:42.267 region:rollup2
RELEASED HER WITH PAPERWORK

02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:44.570 region:rollup2
SAYING SHE WAS A DOMESTIC

02:15:42.267 --> 02:15:46.372 region:rollup2

02:15:46.372 --> 02:15:48.340 region:rollup2
WAS BOOKED HER FINGERPRINTS

02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:50.109 region:rollup2
TRIGGERED AN ICE HOLE.

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:51.343 region:rollup2
.

02:15:50.109 --> 02:15:52.678 region:rollup2
WHICH STORIES LIKE THESE IT IS

02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:53.746 region:rollup2
NOT A SURPRISE THAT AT TWO

THOUSAND THIRTEEN STUDY FOUND

UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WERE

02:15:55.881 --> 02:15:58.684 region:rollup2
LESS LIKELY TO CALL POLICE IF

02:15:57.416 --> 02:16:01.086 region:rollup2
THEY WERE VICTIMS OF A CRIME.

02:15:58.684 --> 02:16:02.388 region:rollup2
THESE AND SIMILAR EXPERIENCES

02:16:01.086 --> 02:16:02.988 region:rollup2

.

02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:29.541 region:rollup2
THE THE IDEA THAT THIS

02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:31.977 region:rollup2
BODY.

02:17:29.541 --> 02:17:34.246 region:rollup2
UP PRODUCES COMPLETE AND PERFECT

02:17:31.977 --> 02:17:35.681 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION TIME AND TIME OUT.

02:17:34.246 --> 02:17:38.217 region:rollup2
IS EVIDENCE THAT.

02:17:35.681 --> 02:17:40.085 region:rollup2
TO BE FAULTY GIVEN THE LARGE

02:17:38.217 --> 02:17:42.755 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THERE ARE

02:17:40.085 --> 02:17:44.189 region:rollup2
FIX IT BILLS AND THAT THERE ARE.

02:17:42.755 --> 02:17:45.791 region:rollup2
CLEAN UP BILLS

02:17:44.189 --> 02:17:50.629 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

02:17:45.791 --> 02:17:50.629 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE.

02:17:50.696 --> 02:17:56.268 region:rollup2
BUT THESE ARE CRIMES WERE. OF.

02:17:54.900 --> 02:17:57.936 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALLY OMITTED BECAUSE

02:17:56.268 --> 02:17:59.638 region:rollup2
THEY.

02:17:57.936 --> 02:18:01.306 region:rollup2
ROSE TO THE LEVEL OF CONCERNS

02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:02.641 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD WAS RAISED BY THE

02:18:01.306 --> 02:18:04.076 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION I THINK IS PATENTLY

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:05.911 region:rollup2
WRONG.

02:18:04.076 --> 02:18:07.346 region:rollup2
IF THAT WERE THE CASE THAT

02:18:05.911 --> 02:18:10.449 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A WHOLE SERIES OF.

02:18:07.346 --> 02:18:13.085 region:rollup2
OF OF OCT. CRIMES INSIDE FIFTY

02:18:10.449 --> 02:18:13.919 region:rollup2
FOUR THAT OUGHT TO BE REMOVED

02:18:13.085 --> 02:18:15.287 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:18:13.919 --> 02:18:15.788 region:rollup2
ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER

02:18:15.287 --> 02:18:17.956 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ANIMAL

02:18:15.788 --> 02:18:19.525 region:rollup2
CRUELTY.

02:18:17.956 --> 02:18:20.826 region:rollup2
THINGS OF THIS NATURE AND I

02:18:19.525 --> 02:18:22.928 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE

02:18:20.826 --> 02:18:25.297 region:rollup2
FROM THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

02:18:22.928 --> 02:18:25.831 region:rollup2
THAT DEPICTED THE SHERIFF'S

02:18:25.297 --> 02:18:28.033 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WERE BROUGHT.

02:18:25.831 --> 02:18:29.735 region:rollup2
CLEARLY INDICATED WHAT THE BILL

02:18:28.033 --> 02:18:31.470 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO DO AND WHAT IT IS IT

02:18:29.735 --> 02:18:32.938 region:rollup2
DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO DO.

02:18:31.470 --> 02:18:36.241 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M ASKING CONSIDERATION.

02:18:32.938 --> 02:18:38.143 region:rollup2
AND AYE VOTE HERE FOR THE CLEAR

02:18:36.241 --> 02:18:40.813 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUS REASONS THAT THERE

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:42.481 region:rollup2
WERE UNINTENTIONAL OMISSIONS

02:18:40.813 --> 02:18:44.716 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE BUILT BACK.

02:18:42.481 --> 02:18:46.451 region:rollup2
BUT INTO SB FIFTY FOUR WE DO

02:18:44.716 --> 02:18:48.053 region:rollup2
THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH

02:18:46.451 --> 02:18:49.955 region:rollup2
OTHER BILLS.

02:18:48.053 --> 02:18:50.856 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK WE CAN SUGGEST

02:18:49.955 --> 02:18:52.491 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT

02:18:50.856 --> 02:18:53.125 region:rollup2
OF THIS LEGISLATURE IS PERFECT

02:18:52.491 --> 02:18:55.260 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:18:53.125 --> 02:18:56.762 region:rollup2
AFTER IT BECOMES LAW WE FIXED

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:59.131 region:rollup2
THESE KINDS OF OVERSIGHTS.

02:18:56.762 --> 02:19:00.299 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY.

02:18:59.131 --> 02:19:02.568 region:rollup2
AND ARE ALSO ONE THAT.

02:19:00.299 --> 02:19:04.102 region:rollup2
THAT AGAIN REITERATED THIS THIS

02:19:02.568 --> 02:19:05.671 region:rollup2
COMES FROM BEING A.

02:19:04.102 --> 02:19:06.738 region:rollup2
EIGHT YEARS MAYOR OF THE CITY

02:19:05.671 --> 02:19:08.807 region:rollup2

FRESNO.

02:19:11.677 --> 02:19:17.950 region:rollup2
THE DISRUPTION IN THE ABILITY.

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:18.917 region:rollup2
FOR THE IMMIGRATION A

02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:21.186 region:rollup2

GO TO THE JAIL AND TO PROCESS

02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:29.328 region:rollup2
AND TO DEAL WITH THESE WHO HAVE.

02:19:26.625 --> 02:19:29.761 region:rollup2
COMMITTED THESE KINDS OF CRIMES.

02:19:29.328 --> 02:19:33.031 region:rollup2
LITERALLY FORCES THE

02:19:29.761 --> 02:19:34.299 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION.

02:19:33.031 --> 02:19:35.200 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO GO OUT INTO THE

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:37.169 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD OUT INTO THE

02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:39.037 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND DO THE KINDS OF

02:19:37.169 --> 02:19:40.038 region:rollup2
THINGS. THAT RESEMBLE AND LOOK

02:19:39.037 --> 02:19:41.940 region:rollup2
LIKE RATES

02:19:40.038 --> 02:19:43.842 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HAD.

02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:44.643 region:rollup2
LOTS OF OTHER EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE

02:19:43.842 --> 02:19:47.279 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE GOTTEN.

02:19:44.643 --> 02:19:48.547 region:rollup2
OUT.

02:19:47.279 --> 02:19:49.314 region:rollup2
ICE IS GONE AFTER THEM. THEY

02:19:48.547 --> 02:19:51.750 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:19:49.314 --> 02:19:54.553 region:rollup2
BRIAN.

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:55.120 region:rollup2

HIGH SPEED CHASES HAVE BEEN

02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:58.624 region:rollup2
SUED.

02:19:56.355 --> 02:20:00.259 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO BE

02:19:58.624 --> 02:20:02.261 region:rollup2
SAFE FOR EVERYBODY?

02:20:00.259 --> 02:20:04.062 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO HAVE.

02:20:02.261 --> 02:20:06.098 region:rollup2
THE CONVICTION.

02:20:04.062 --> 02:20:06.498 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ARE PRESENTLY AT THE

A PROCESSED IN THE JAIL

02:20:10.602 --> 02:20:17.042 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT SO THAT WE DO NOT

02:20:17.042 --> 02:20:21.813 region:rollup2
IT IN THE COMMUNITIES OUT AS A

02:20:19.177 --> 02:20:25.183 region:rollup2
RESULT.

02:20:21.813 --> 02:20:26.685 region:rollup2
THESE ARE A CO EQUAL IN VALUE TO

WERE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE.

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:41.600 region:rollup2
I THIS DOES NOT DAMAGE OR

BEING SUGGESTED. IT DOES ADD A

02:20:44.736 --> 02:20:48.307 region:rollup2
FEW MORE BETTER OBVIOUSLY

02:20:47.205 --> 02:20:50.509 region:rollup2
VIOLENT. AND.

02:20:48.307 --> 02:20:52.277 region:rollup2
SETUP.

02:20:50.509 --> 02:20:53.745 region:rollup2
THEY'VE MUCH MORE SAFE AND AND.

02:20:52.277 --> 02:20:57.316 region:rollup2
.

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:59.818 region:rollup2
POPE PROCESSING OF ALL OF THIS.

02:20:57.316 --> 02:21:02.054 region:rollup2
ARE IN ORG ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH.

EVERYONE IS SAFE.

02:21:02.054 --> 02:21:05.090 region:rollup2
TO DO OTHERWISE IS REALLY

02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:06.391 region:rollup2
PUTTING A LOT OF PEOPLE AT RISK

02:21:05.090 --> 02:21:06.925 region:rollup2
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TO THESE

02:21:06.391 --> 02:21:08.427 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED CHASES INTO THE

SURVIVE.

02:27:41.486 --> 02:27:44.255 region:rollup2
IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE SHAME AND

02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:45.990 region:rollup2
DEPRIVATION THAT MANY PEOPLE

02:27:44.255 --> 02:27:47.892 region:rollup2
FEEL FOR RELYING ON OUTSIDE

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:51.229 region:rollup2

I HAVE FIVE DOLLARS ON MY BOOKS.

02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:11.983 region:rollup2

COPAY.

02:28:32.604 --> 02:28:36.174 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE IN THE INDIGENTS

02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:38.176 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD ALLOWS REASONABLE AND

02:28:36.174 --> 02:28:38.810 region:rollup2
FAIR AMOUNT OF BREATHING ROOM.

02:28:38.176 --> 02:28:40.211 region:rollup2
FOR THE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:28:38.810 --> 02:28:45.316 region:rollup2

02:28:40.211 --> 02:28:49.788 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT

02:28:45.316 --> 02:28:51.423 region:rollup2
BURNING FAMILIES ARE HEADED FOR

02:28:49.788 --> 02:28:52.323 region:rollup2
WILL BASIC NEEDS ALTOGETHER.

02:28:51.423 --> 02:28:54.626 region:rollup2
WE RECEIVED THIS LETTER IN

02:28:52.323 --> 02:28:55.293 region:rollup2

INSTITUTION.

02:28:56.494 --> 02:28:59.564 region:rollup2
FOR WOMEN.

02:28:58.963 --> 02:29:08.807 region:rollup2
IT'S BILLS OUT THE REALITY ONE

02:28:59.564 --> 02:29:10.708 region:rollup2
LESS THAN IN TO CHET AND

02:29:08.807 --> 02:29:12.944 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T BUY ANYTHING WITH A

02:29:10.708 --> 02:29:16.114 region:rollup2
DOLLAR INSIDE OR OUTSIDE.

02:29:12.944 --> 02:29:16.681 region:rollup2
SO I'M JUST GOING TO READ JUST

02:29:16.114 --> 02:29:21.186 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF STATEMENTS FROM

02:29:16.681 --> 02:29:24.055 region:rollup2
FOLKS. INSIDE OF THEM.

02:29:21.186 --> 02:29:25.657 region:rollup2
ó THIS ONE I THOUGHT WAS

02:29:24.055 --> 02:29:27.826 region:rollup2
REALLY INTERESTING THAT SHE

02:29:25.657 --> 02:29:30.495 region:rollup2
WRITES AT THIS ONE DOLLAR LESS

02:29:27.826 --> 02:29:32.497 region:rollup2
RESULTS IN POTENTIAL VIOLENCE.

02:29:30.495 --> 02:29:34.032 region:rollup2
AND DAMAGE TO WOMEN'S SELF

02:29:32.497 --> 02:29:36.968 region:rollup2
ESTEEM BECAUSE YOUR TEASE THE TO

02:29:34.032 --> 02:29:38.703 region:rollup2
SMELL SO TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE.

02:29:36.968 --> 02:29:41.139 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

02:29:38.703 --> 02:29:42.874 region:rollup2
ALSO FACE INSIDE IS.

02:29:41.139 --> 02:29:44.742 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THE MATERIALS VOTE

02:29:42.874 --> 02:29:45.710 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY'RE GIVEN

02:29:44.742 --> 02:29:46.211 region:rollup2
TO CHOOSE FROM MORE OFTEN AS YOU

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:48.079 region:rollup2
CAN IMAGINE NOT QUALITY

02:29:46.211 --> 02:29:49.414 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS.

02:29:48.079 --> 02:29:51.249 region:rollup2
SO FOR SOME OF THE WOMEN IN THE

02:29:49.414 --> 02:29:53.451 region:rollup2
ROOM YOU GUYS CAN PROBABLY

02:29:51.249 --> 02:29:54.919 region:rollup2
RELATE TO USING A KOTEX OR

02:29:53.451 --> 02:29:56.754 region:rollup2
TAMPON THAT'S THAT'S REALLY NOT

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:57.989 region:rollup2
ANY GOOD FOR YOU AND THEN YOU'D

02:29:56.754 --> 02:29:58.590 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT. PIECES OF IT COMING

02:29:57.989 --> 02:30:01.292 region:rollup2
OUT OF YOU ALONG WITH BLOOD

02:29:58.590 --> 02:30:03.194 region:rollup2
CLOTS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD

02:30:01.292 --> 02:30:03.628 region:rollup2
TO BUY ANY CALL PRODUCTS SO THIS

02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:05.530 region:rollup2
IS OUTSIDE.

02:30:03.628 --> 02:30:06.764 region:rollup2
INSIDE IT'S WORSE IT REALLY IS

02:30:05.530 --> 02:30:08.566 region:rollup2
WORSE I'M NOT A FORMALLY

02:30:06.764 --> 02:30:09.467 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED PERSON THAT I'VE

02:30:08.566 --> 02:30:10.869 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN THE

02:30:09.467 --> 02:30:14.239 region:rollup2
PRESENTS FOR TEN YEARS WOMEN

02:30:10.869 --> 02:30:15.273 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY. AND ALL OF THIS IS

02:30:14.239 --> 02:30:17.508 region:rollup2
JUST REALLY NOT OKAY WE EXPECT

02:30:15.273 --> 02:30:18.309 region:rollup2
THESE PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND

02:30:17.508 --> 02:30:19.744 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME KIND OF SENSE OF

02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:21.579 region:rollup2
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND

02:30:19.744 --> 02:30:23.581 region:rollup2
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY WHERE.

02:30:21.579 --> 02:30:25.450 region:rollup2
THEY'VE HAD TO FIGHT OR

OTHERWISE JOCKEY AROUND FOR

02:30:25.450 --> 02:30:33.057 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A BAR

02:30:26.851 --> 02:30:38.663 region:rollup2
SOAP OR TOOTHPASTE OR A RECALL

02:30:33.057 --> 02:30:43.067 region:rollup2

WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE INSIDE AS

SHE WRITES INMATES.

02:30:51.276 --> 02:30:54.112 region:rollup2
WORKING FOR EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR

02:30:52.076 --> 02:30:55.346 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. I

02:30:54.112 --> 02:30:57.081 region:rollup2
NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO BUY FLOUR

02:30:55.346 --> 02:30:59.017 region:rollup2
DOLLAR IN MY TRUST MAKES ME TOO

PRISONS AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY

02:56:27.143 --> 02:56:31.714 region:rollup2
SOMEONE IN THE EYES.

02:56:28.945 --> 02:56:33.650 region:rollup2
MOTHER OF FATHER WHO HAS LOST

02:56:31.714 --> 02:56:36.186 region:rollup2
THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER IN THESE

02:56:33.650 --> 02:56:38.855 region:rollup2
TYPES OF TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:56:36.186 --> 02:56:40.457 region:rollup2
AND YET. YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS

02:56:38.855 --> 02:56:43.993 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET AWAY.

02:56:40.457 --> 02:56:44.427 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF MRS GIPSON NO

02:56:43.993 --> 02:56:45.395 region:rollup2
ONE'S EVER BEEN HELD

02:56:44.427 --> 02:56:48.064 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE.

02:56:45.395 --> 02:56:49.833 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF MISTER GLOVER

02:56:48.064 --> 02:56:52.702 region:rollup2
THIS YOUNG MAN.

02:56:49.833 --> 02:56:55.905 region:rollup2
WHO WAS TAKEN AWAY? TRAGICALLY.

02:56:52.702 --> 02:56:57.173 region:rollup2
THIS INDIVIDUAL. DID EVERYTHING

02:56:55.905 --> 02:56:58.908 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE TO EVADE.

02:56:57.173 --> 02:57:00.210 region:rollup2
BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE AND

02:56:58.908 --> 02:57:02.946 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE AND SO.

02:57:00.210 --> 02:57:04.113 region:rollup2
FOR ME IT'S ABOUT JUSTICE

02:57:02.946 --> 02:57:06.082 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

02:57:04.113 --> 02:57:07.717 region:rollup2
AND ALSO.

02:57:06.082 --> 02:57:08.952 region:rollup2
A COMFORTING FOR A FAMILY

02:57:07.717 --> 02:57:11.254 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT YEAH.

02:57:08.952 --> 02:57:12.956 region:rollup2
THE CHILD WILL NEVER.

02:57:11.254 --> 02:57:13.890 region:rollup2
BE BACK WITH US BUT THE FACT IS

02:57:12.956 --> 02:57:15.892 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEONE WAS HELD

02:57:13.890 --> 02:57:17.060 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTION AND

02:57:15.892 --> 02:57:19.796 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS

02:57:17.060 --> 02:57:20.497 region:rollup2
DOWN TO ITS ACCOUNTABILITY. AND

02:57:19.796 --> 02:57:21.731 region:rollup2
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.

02:57:20.497 --> 02:57:23.766 region:rollup2
.

02:57:21.731 --> 02:57:26.102 region:rollup2
ANYONE.

02:57:23.766 --> 02:57:28.505 region:rollup2
WHO FLEES FROM A ACCIDENTALLY

02:57:26.102 --> 02:57:30.607 region:rollup2
HIT AND RUN ACCIDENT AND THE

02:57:28.505 --> 02:57:32.208 region:rollup2
OUTCOME IS FATAL I MEAN I CAN

02:57:30.607 --> 02:57:33.476 region:rollup2
IMAGINE? THE CONSCIENCE

02:57:32.208 --> 02:57:34.410 region:rollup2
OF THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO IS GIVEN

02:57:33.476 --> 02:57:36.012 region:rollup2

02:57:34.410 --> 02:57:37.313 region:rollup2
KNOWING OR NOT KNOWING THAT

02:57:36.012 --> 02:57:39.549 region:rollup2
THEY'VE.

02:57:37.313 --> 02:57:39.816 region:rollup2
HARM SOMEONE.

02:57:39.549 --> 02:57:41.551 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

02:57:39.816 --> 02:57:43.586 region:rollup2
IN.

02:57:41.551 --> 02:57:44.154 region:rollup2
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REMORSE

02:57:43.586 --> 02:57:45.488 region:rollup2
FOR THAT TYPE OF ACTION YOU

02:57:44.154 --> 02:57:47.257 region:rollup2
KNOW.

02:57:45.488 --> 02:57:49.192 region:rollup2
A TWO YEAR PRISON IMPRISONMENT

02:57:47.257 --> 02:57:51.327 region:rollup2
FOR THAT TYPE OF SITUATION IS.

02:57:49.192 --> 02:57:52.495 region:rollup2
NOT JUSTICE

02:57:51.327 --> 02:57:54.697 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

02:57:52.495 --> 02:57:56.799 region:rollup2

THE SENSE HERE IS THAT. YET THIS

02:58:03.873 --> 02:58:06.743 region:rollup2
WILL DETER. THESE TYPES OF

02:58:05.775 --> 02:58:08.511 region:rollup2
THINGS FROM HAPPENING BUT THE

02:58:06.743 --> 02:58:09.779 region:rollup2

THEIR ACTIONS AND I THINK. THAT.

.

02:58:34.037 --> 02:58:37.307 region:rollup2
IT IS DIFFICULT. LISTENING TO
