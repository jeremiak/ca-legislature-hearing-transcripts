YEAH I THINK YOU NEED TO PRESS ARE ABOUT MUCH HAS MY- AT THANK YOU I CHAIR FRIEDMAN MEMBERS MY CHECK WITH SORT OF MERCHANTS SHIPPING ASSOCIATION AND WE'RE PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION WITH SENSE OF OUR PILOTS IN THE CRUISE LINE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. AS A MEMBER GRAYSON POINTED OUT. WE DO HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN RIGHT NOW. ONE OF THOSE IS UNFORTUNATELY- ADEQUATELY- ASSESSING. WHAT OUR OVERALL COSTS FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE PILOTAGE SERVICES WE RECEIVE IN THE BAY AREA ARE. AND WILL BE. OUT LAST YEAR- WE WORK WITH MISTER GRAYSON SENSE GO BAR PILOTS TO ADDRESS MANY OF THOSE ISSUES THROUGH SOME SURCHARGES WERE LIMITED IN SCOPE AND DURATION. THIS BILL IS AN OUTGROWTH OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. WE HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS UNDERWAY WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THOSE OTHER OPTIONS BUT FOR NOW WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US IS A CONSENSUS MEASURE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SPREAD THE PAYMENTS AND COSTS OF THE TRANSITION TO CLEANER FLEETS IN THE- PILOT- BOATS OWNERSHIP IN CARE- A- LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WITH MORE VESSELS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE IN THOSE COSTS THOSE ARE COSTS THAT WE AS AN INDUSTRY LOOK FORWARD TO PAYING IN A WAY WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT MORE RATIONAL. AND LESS PRESCRIPTIVE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE CO SPONSORING THIS MEASURE A TURNOVER DAY CAPTAIN MCINTYRE SUBSCRIBER OPPOSE TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICALLY. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY ON THIS BILL. HI MY NAME IS- CAPTAIN AND MCINTYRE IN THE BUSINESS DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAR PILOTS SOME OF FORMER MARITIME PILOT OREGON AND- SERVED ON. A THE OREGON PILOT COMMISSION FOR TWO TERMS. OF SAN FRANCISCO BAR PILOT IS A CO SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIFTY SIX AND THAT IS TO AUTHORIZE THE BOARD OF PILOT COMMISSIONERS TO ADJUST. THE PILOT BOTH SURCHARGE TO INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED. WITH THE ACQUISITION OF NEW PILOT BOATS OF THE REPOWERING OF EXISTING BOTH IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEW CAR BACK COMMERCIAL HOVERCRAFT- REQUIREMENTS. UGH WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE TO THAT THE PILOTS GIVEN THE ROLE THAT WE PLAY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. IN OUR PILOT BOATS ARE ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDING A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. ON DEMAND SERVICE- THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR- I'VE SAN FRANCISCO BAR PILOTS ARE- SUPPORTER OF LOWER ADMISSIONS- WE SUPPORT GREEN TECHNOLOGY AND WE ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW ARE IN THE PROCESS OF A- CONSTRUCTING- THE COUNTRY'S FIRST. TIER FOR LOW EMISSION PILOT VESSEL. HOWEVER THE NEW CAR BREAK ELATION- GREATLY ACCELERATE- THE TIME SCHEDULE THAT WE HAVE TO REPLACE OUR FLEET WE HAVE A TOTAL OF FIVE PILOT BOATS- AND THAT REPLACEMENT MUST ALL OCCUR BEFORE THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AT A COST THAT IS EVER INCREASING RIGHT NOW WE'RE ESTIMATING THAT COSTS TO BE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. A BECAUSE OF THE COST IN THE XCELERATED- SCHEDULE WE BELIEVE THE SOONER WE CAN COLLECT FUNDS. OFTHE LAST ECONOMIC SHOCK BECAUSE THERE IS TO THE SYSTEM AND THEREFORE WE WOULD ASK YOU. TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIFTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION ON FILE SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY TO GIVE ANY TESTIMONY AGAIN. LIMITED TO JUST NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION THANK YOU. ONE MOMENT NOW HOW DO WE START CAN WE TURN THEIR MY CON PLEASE.

SPECIALIST WILL TAKE YOUR NAME AND GIVE YOU YOUR LIFE NUMBER. WILL OPEN UP YOUR LINE WHEN YOU'RE READY. MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE KNOWN CHEWING UP AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE WILL GO TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES. VICE CHAIR FOR. I THANK YOU- MY QUESTION A AND A CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FOUR PILOTS IN THE ROLE YOU PLAY AND WHEN THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN WITH SUPPLY CHAIN AND JUST THE COSTS GOING UP- WOULD. IT BE NECESSARY TO YOU SOMEHOW. DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CARPOOLS AND BY SOME TIME OUT TO WEAR BECAUSE TO BE A LITTLE MORE REASONABLE- TO REPLACE THE FLEET. IS ACT IS THAT ACOSTA IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S UNDER CONSIDERATION OR A CONVERSATION CERTAINLY IS A CONVERSATION THAT THE BAR PILOTS HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH CARP- IF WE WERE ABLE TO EXTEND THE REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE FOR THE CURRENT LIFE OF THE VESSELS THAT WE HAVE- THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS- EASING THE TRANSITION INTO INTO THESE NEW- THESE NEW VESSELS THE TECHNOLOGY IS. IS VERY NEW- THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFICULTY AND- SECURING- SHIPYARD SPACE IT'S A NEW DESIGN PILOT VESSELS ARE UNIQUE. NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST BUY OFF THE SHELF SO EXTENSIONS- AT CARB ABSOLUTELY- WOULD WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO US IN IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW FLEET. AND AT LAST QUESTION OUT OF CURIOSITY WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SOMETHING THAT IS A MAN OW LONG DO YOUR VOTE SHOULD ONLY LASSEN. AND WHERE ARE WE IN THAT TIME FRAME I IS THE BIG TYPICALLY CAN LAST- YOU KNOW TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS- IT WE THE LAST VOTE I BELIEVE WAS BUILT IN TWO. THOUSAND NINE- BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT- IN FRONT OF ME I CAN CERTAINLY GET THAT NUMBER TO YOU BUT IT'S A CONTINUAL OF REPLACEMENT A SCHEDUL THAT WE DO. A CELEBRITY THAT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE I TO THE TO THE AUTHOR THAT MAYBE SOMEDAY WE MAY END UP IN TO PAIR. WITH THIS IF THE COST CONTINUE TO RISE I'M NOT SURE- FROM- MURPHY STANDPOINT- HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO- TO YOU- WHAT WEATHER WAKE UP AT. A GUY CAL FOR ALL OF THE WHOLE OF THE RISING COSTS OF THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE MADE DISCUSS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OF A POP. SO I'M A PINCH HITTER HERE I'M JUST. DURING THE TEMPORARY- THANK HERE BUT I'M ALSO A MARINER. CAPTAIN AND I'VE OBSERVED HUNDREDS OF PILOT BOATS COMING AGAINST US- NAVY SHIPS OR GOING ALONG SIDE IT SHOULD SAY SO. I DO- APPRECIATE VICE CHAIR PHONES. COMMENTS ABOUT SHIPPING FEES SHIPPING FEES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE GONE UP SIX TIMES BUT MY KEY QUESTION IS WHY DOESN'T THIS BILL. HELP LONG BEACH AND SAN DIEGO WHY NOT MAKE IT. WAIT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THAT'S MY QUESTION. PERFORATING ANSWER WHOEVER WOULD LIKE MAKE A THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT THE PILOTS IN LA LONG BEACH- GOVERNED UNDER A SEPARATE- GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WHETHER PRIMARILY GOVERNED BY FEDERAL- PILOTAGE STATUTES AND LICENSING- SO THE STATE PILOTAGE AND SERVICES GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT- AND WE ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE VERY SPECIFIC COST FOR SOME CISCO PILOTAGE VESSELS IN THIS BILL. THE SAME ISSUE IT DOES APPLY AND SO IN CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL HAS A BILL WITH RESPECT TO- SOME OF THESE COSTS WITH RESPECT TO OTHER VESSELS IMPACTED BY THE CAR COMMERCIAL HOVERCRAFT RULES BESIDES JUST THESE VESSELS WERE TALKING ABOUT- BUT TO VICE CHAIR FONG'S QUESTION. WE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THESE SURCHARGES IS THE VESSELS TURN OVER ON THEIR OWN THEY HAVE A NATURAL SCHEDULE FOR DOING THEN- THEY DON'T ALL GET CLUMPED INTO ONE PAYMENT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW IS INSTEAD OF HAVING THOSE- NATURAL RETIREMENT IS VESSELS OVER TIME SO THE SURCHARGES ESSENTIALLY A RETIRED THEMSELVES OVER TIME- ACTUALLY. THEY'LL ALL COME DO IT ONCE. SO WILL HAVE A CONCENTRATED PAYMENT PERIOD SO INSTEAD OF HAVING- LOWER FEES OVER TIME WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS US TO DEAL WITH THE FACT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF CONSTRUCTION OCCURRING AT SAME TIME. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. THANK YOU CHAIR- AND- PRE PANDEMIC HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN US BUT MY DISTRICT STAFF AND I KNEW A BAR PILOTS WHERE BASEBALL IS TOLD ME THAT IT UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY GET ON THE VESSELS AND SEE THE WORK THAT THE BAR OPPOSED TO IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT AND INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS OTHERS MENTIONED. ADDITIONALLY AND I BELIEVE THAT THE BAR PILOTS IN THE BAY FIRST OF ALL THE BAY ITSELF IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING UP WHEN I LEARNED- BASED UPON THE DIFFERENT APPS AND CHANNELS THAT OF THE BAR PILOTS. ARE FAMILIAR WITH- BUT ALSO. GOING TO THE DELTA ALL THE WAY FAR AS THE PORT STOCKTON. THIS IS HOW FAR THESE BAR PILOTS ACTUALLY- OPERATE THESE SHIPS AND SO IT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE VERY NARAL CHANNELS THAT WE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE FOR MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF MILES IN SOME. CASES AS A FORMER CHAIR OF THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND- NUMBER BALK ADE SIMILAR TO CARB- AS REALLY PLAYED. A PUT A HUGE FOCUS ON EMISSIONS AROUND IN AND AROUND THE PORTS. AND I THINK GIVEN AGAIN THE DISTANCES THAT WERE UP THERE TALKING ABOUT OF THESE VESSELS AND JUST THE FACT THAT TURNOVERS COMING THAT IT'S A GOOD TIME FOR THAT. TRANSITION TO MEET OUR GREENHOUSE- GAS EMISSIONS GOALS. WHEN I WENT ON THE BOAT AND IT WAS NICE IT WAS DOUBLY WASN'T NEW BUT IT WAS IT WAS NICE AND I BUT I DO THINK YOU KNOW AS THEY DO COME. WHAT THE COMMISSION THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY AND I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND WHY THAT EXTRA COST WOULD NOT BE MANAGEABLE UNDER THE CURRENT FEE STRUCTURE AND SO APPRECIATE OF A SUMMER GRAYSON FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND THE GREAT WORK OF- THE BAR PILOTS IN THE BAY. I WOULD THAT LIKE. TO MAKE A MOTION. GOOD ABOUT. OKAY ANY OTHER DISCUSSION WE HAVE TO GROW AND ESTABLISH QUORUM SO CAN WE PLEASE- THE GIRL. FRIEDMAN HERE.

OKAY WHAT IS THE VOTE THE FIFTEEN SORRY WHAT CONSENT CALENDAR IS ADOPTED MR STONE YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM pJOURNEY TO A. B. SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX STARTED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME IS ENSURING THAT WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATING CALIFORNIA COME OUT THEY CAN HAVE A- VALID. IDENTIFICATION BECAUSE A THE CHALLENGES OF PRESENTING A PRISON ID OR OTHER TYPES OF A VERIFICATIONS WHO'S REALLY DAUNTING AND WE KNOW THAT A VALID IDENTIFICATION FOR SOMEBODY COMING OUT OF THE COMMUNITY. IS A MAJOR INDICATOR OR GIVE THEM THE ABILITY HAVE SUCCESS THEY COULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE NOT HAVING AN IDEAS IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD THOUGH IN GETTING DRIVER'S LICENSES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE INSIDE IS THAT NOT ALL. PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE. AS THEY COME OUT- ELIGIBLE FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE WHEN THIS BODY PASSED DRIVER'S LICENSES A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO FOR IN DOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS IT DID NOT CONTEMPLATE A CALIFORNIA ID. SO NOW SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR A FEDERAL ID. CANNOT HAVE A CALIFORNIA ID. UNLESS THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GETTING A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE. AB SEVENTY SIXTY SIX IS A BILL TO CLOSE THAT GAP IT WOULD MAKE. ELIGIBLE ANYONE TO GET A CALIFORNIA ID WHO IS NOT OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE. INCLUDING WITHOUT REGARD TO DOCUMENTATION STATUS. A BALLOT IDEA SOMETHING WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE THEM AND- HAVING THE ABILITY TO PRESENT OURSELVES WHETHER IT'S FOR LOAN OR WHETHER IT'S FOR HOUSING OR WHAT WHATEVER IT IS IN OUR SOCIETY AND NOT HAVING AN IDEA IS A IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT SO THIS IS WHAT EXPAND TO THE UNDOCUMENTED DRIVERS LICENSE PROGRAM THAT'S THERE THE ABILITY FOR SOMEONE. WITHOUT THE CONDITION OR OTHERWISE NOT WILLING OR ABLE TO GET A FULL. I. D. BLESSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE LICENSE PLUS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA ID SO THAT THEY ARE KNOWN TO CALIFORNIA. AND THEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO LIVE THEIR LIVES WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE CHANCE OF SUCCESS. WITH ME TODAY ALSO.

THIS BILL IS ABOUT ENSURING THE BASELINE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EVERY PERSON LIVING IN THIS STATE REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL STATUS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA APPROVED AB SIXTY WHICH ALLOWED UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS TO OBTAIN A DRIVER'S LICENSE AS A RESULT THE ONLY STATE ISSUED ID SOMEONE WITH UNDOCUMENTED STATUS CAN HAVE. IS A DRIVER'S LICENSE LEAVING A VULNERABLE PORTION OF THE POPULATION WHO LACKS ACCESS TO A CAR OR THE ABILITY TO DRIVE FROM ANY FORM OF A DID A COMPLETE IDENTIFICATION. MY COLLEAGUES AND I JOIN AUTHORED AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX TO HELP ADDRESS A GLARING GAP IN THE CURRENT STATUTE ONE THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY PREVENTS WOMEN. DISABLED AND ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH UNDOCUMENTED STATUS FROM DOING THINGS EVERY DAY THAT MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM LIKELY TAKE FOR GRANTED WITHOUT AN IDENTIFICATION CARD IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN'T OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT YOU CAN'T RENT AN APARTMENT OR HOME. YOU CAN'T EVEN CAST A HARDER CHECK WITHOUT AN ID CARD A PARENT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PICK UP THEIR CHILD'S PRESCRIPTIONS AT THE LOCAL PHARMACY. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX IS NOT ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT LANDLORDS IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IN THIS STATE CAN LEAD A NORMAL LIFE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. THIS BILL WILL HELP MAKE THAT VISION A REALITY FOR AROUND ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS THEY FACE OBSTACLES ON A DAILY BASIS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAURA CALL LOTUS I'M HERE TO SUPPORT EIGHTY SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX LEGISLATION THAT WOULD GIVE ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA ID CARDS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR LEGAL STATUS. I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIANS WITH UNDOCUMENTED STATUS WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO IDENTIFY OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN SCHOOLS TO OPEN BANK ACCOUNT. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE PICTURE HOUSING AND MUCH MORE. AT THE MEXICAN I HAVE A CONSULAR REGISTRATION THAT HAS ALREADY EXPIRED DO THAT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SECURE AN APPOINTMENT TO RENEW IT AND IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE I HAVE. NO WAY TO IDENTIFY MYSELF. YES WE CAN USE CONTACT ID PASSPORT TO CORROBORATE OUR IDENTITY. HOWEVER THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROCESS FOR US WHO ARE NOT IN THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY. AND IT STOPPED MANY FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY FROM ASKING FOR HELP ACCESSING SERVICES AND PARTICIPATING IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE ARE AFRAID TO USE OUR CONSULAR IDEAS OUR PASSPORT TO IDENTIFY OURSELVES BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SURE WHO WE ARE DISPLAYING OUR INFORMATION TO. HOW THEY WILL REACT OR HOW THEY WILL TREAT US AND OUR FAMILY. THAT IS WHY WE NEED A PATH AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX SO WE CAN PARTICIPATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT FEAR. THANK YOU. I WILL GO NOW TO READ MY STATEMENT AND THE LEGAL PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT THE END OF IT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WILL FILL THE GAP FOR THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS TO SOME FORM OF GOVERNMENT ISSUED PHOTO ID. SOMETHING THAT IS CRITICAL TO FULL PARTICIPATION IN OUR COMMUNITY. STARTING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AT SIXTY NEW DRIVER'S LICENSES AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT REGARD TO IMMIGRATION STATUS. THIS BILL IS THE RESULT OF ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AND ADVOCACY AND WEATHER CONTINUES TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE THE VEIL THEMSELVES OF THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT'S NOT MY LOVER THE MOST. MARGINALIZE CAL DO NOT HAVE A CAR OR CAR THAT COULD PASS INSPECTION. THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE CAR INSURANCE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM DRIVING. OR THOSE WHO SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DRIVE. THEY ALL REMAIN UNABLE TO ACCESS THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT ISSUED PHOTO ID EIGHTY SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX WOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. RIGHT NOW THEY MUST RELY UPON AN ALTERNATIVE ID IF THEY EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO ONE SUCH AS A FOREIGN CONSULAR ID YOUR FOREIGN PASSPORT. THESE ALTERNATIVE IDEAS MAY NOT BE UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED. AS LORD IT SHARED. IN THE TRANSLATED STATEMENT I READ SHE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO RENEW HER CONCERT HE BECAUSE OF THAT AND THEN. I WANT TO THANK YOU. MEMBER FOR PUTTING THIS. ALLEGEDLY TO ENSURE THAT NO CALIFORNIA LACK THE BALLOT GOVERNMENT ISSUED PHOTO ID. SIMPLY BECAUSE FOR THOSE TWO AND DOCUMENTED WE HAVE TIED HAVING AN ID TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME. TO PRESENT THIS BILL IS BRAND NEW BEAUTIFUL ROLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN TO ALLOW ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO EXPAND A REBATE FOR GRAIN TRANSPORTATION DEVICE. MAKING THEM MORE AFFORDABLE FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY THERE ARE REBATE PROGRAMS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND SPECIFICALLY FOR E. BIKES BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAMS AND CAN ACT L. TO R. ACT AS A LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD FULL ELECTRIC CAR VEHICLES. AND EVEN SMALLER DEVICES CAN COST ANYWHERE BETWEEN. THREE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE FOR MEETING THIS. IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT WHOM TOP PRIORITY IS TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. CLOSE ON THEIR FAMILY'S BACKS. THIS IS STILL TOO EXPENSIVE SOMETIMES THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A REBATE PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES OTHER GREEN TECHNOLOGY LIKE E. SCOOTERS. E. SKATEBOARDS AND NEIGHBORHOOD OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES- THESE ARE WE CALL MANY VEHICLES THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO GET BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS- TO THEIR OWN SEPARATE DESTINATIONS AND JUST EVEN GO TO THE STORE THIS IS NOT TO DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM PURCHASING A FULL SIZE ELECTRIC VEHICLE. PEOPLE MY DISTRICT ARE STILL TAKING TRACK PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THEY'RE STILL PUTTING I'M IS THAT GOING TO STARBUCKS THEY ARE STILL- PUTTING MAKING INSTANT COFFEE AND PUTTING IT INTO A THERMOS TO GET TO GO TO WORK OR RIDING THEIR BIKES AND PUTTING IT ON A BUS RATHER WE ARE ENCOURAGING MORE CALIFORNIA'S TO ADOPT LESS EXPENSIVE. GREEN OPPORTUNITIES EXPRESS THE LOK INCOME POPULATIONS THESE DEVICES ARE ALSO MORE PORTABLE NO ONE UNDERSCORE PORTABLE IF OWN THEY CAN BE CHARGED AT HOME. OR IN SMALLER SPACES ABOUT 70% OF THE TRIPS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ARE WITHIN THREE MILES OF A PERSON'S HOME. THIS IS A DISTANCE TO OF SO MANY WHO WALKS AND ALSO WHO TAKES SHORT TRIPS FOR TRANSPORTATION. AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS ARE HAVE THE ARE HEAVILY ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT STILL CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICTS PAYS WATCHES THIRTY POINT 5% MORE TRANSPORTATION EACH YEAR THEN THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR JOBS. AND GASOLINE IS STILL TOO HIGH. THESE EXPENSE TIES COMMUNITIES DOWNS AND CONTINUE- TO MAKE SURE THAT RESIDENTS- AGAINST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN MEET THE BASIC NEEDS. IN THE COMMUNITY IF WE WISH TO MEET OUR EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS AS A STATE WE SET OF FINE FASTER AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE EVEN OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO ADOPT GREEN TECHNOLOGY THIS ISN'T THIS- CAN ASSIST THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES AND IT COULD BE DONE NOW.
