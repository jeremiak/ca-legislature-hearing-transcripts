AS THE CASE MAY BE- RESUMES ARE

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.561
VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE I LOOK

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:44.764
FORWARD TO. MOVING HERE

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.898
CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.434
TIME JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION A

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:51.170
MY PERCEPTION IS THAT THE-

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:53.105
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IMPORTANT

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:55.842
MEDITATION OF OUR- EL CAP AND

00:07:55.908 --> 00:08:00.479
I'LL SEE IF OF PROCESS. IS

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:04.283
UNEVEN AT BEST ACROSS THE STATE.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.019
WHAT ROLE DO YOU THINK WHAT

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:08.621
IMPORTANT ROLE DO YOU THINK

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:10.289
THAT THE BOARD HAS IN ENSURING

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:14.527
BOTH THE- LET THE LC HEALTHCARE

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:18.664
PROCESSES BOTH INCLUSIVE. AND

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:22.969
EFFECTIVE. IF IT'S A FAIR

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.504
QUESTION YES. THE BOTH OF US WE

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:29.075
JUST PEPPER ONE ACCORD OKAY FOR

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.210
BOTH SO- I THINK THAT'S A GREAT

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:32.311
QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:33.880
QUITE HONESTLY THE TENSION

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:35.848
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW FOR

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:38.317
THE FIRST TIME- WE HAVE SEEN

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:40.686
POSITIVE RESULTS AS A RESULT OF

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.355
THE WORK THAT LOCALS ARE DOING

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.656
AND GRAPPLING WITH WITH LOCAL

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:46.626
CONTROL WE HAVE. LESS SCHOOLS

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:48.027
IN NEED OF DIFFERENCE

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:50.229
ASSISTANCE AND WE SAW AN UPTICK

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:52.665
IN MANY OF OUR- INDICATORS

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:55.234
OUTSIDE OF CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:56.302
IN FACT ONE OF THE SUB GROUPS

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.738
THAT HAD THE STEEPNESS OF

00:08:58.804 --> 00:08:59.505
GREENS WAS STUDENTS WITH

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.507
DISABILITIES THE BALANCING ACT

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:03.476
IS CREATING A MECHANISM WHERE

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:04.477
WE CAN HEAR THE STAKEHOLDERS AT

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:06.779
THE STATE BOARD. AND WE LISTEN

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:07.713
TO THOSE STAKEHOLDERS AND WE

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.017
DON'T- DEVELOP IN MY OPINION.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.051
EL CAP THAT IS EVER ONE AND

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:14.720
DONE IT'S A FOR GOING TO MODEL

00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:16.055
IMPROVEMENT ACROSS THE STATE

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:17.390
AND THE IDEA FOR THE STATE

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:20.293
BOARD IS THAT WE- TESTED. WE

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:21.861
SEE IF IT CAPTURES THE ESSENCE

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.296
OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:24.897
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVE

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.565
AND WE LET THE DATA DRIVES THE

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:29.135
OUTCOMES WE LET THE DATA DRIVES

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:31.037
THE INTENSITY OF RESOURCE

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:34.440
ALLOCATION AND THE- SUPPORTS

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:36.208
THAT ARE NEEDED SO FOR ME I

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:37.677
THINK AT AS A STATE BOARD I

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:39.045
THINK IT'S AN INCUMBENT THAT WE

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:41.314
HEAR THE STAKEHOLDERS- WE HEAR

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.048
THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:43.249
HAVING WITH REGARDS TO.

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:45.384
UNDERSTANDING THE ELCA MAKING

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:46.452
SENSE F THE OKAY UP IN TERMS

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.820
OF WHERE MONEY IS GOING AND HOW

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:50.589
IT'S BEING CATERED AT THE SAME

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:51.991
TIME WE BALANCED OUT BY.

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:52.925
ANALYZING THE DATA HIGHLIGHTING

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:54.427
THOSE THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:58.364
WORKING ACROSS OUR STATE- AND-

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.933
MAKE THEM VISIBLE AND HAD.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.101
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER SO THAT

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:03.402
WE CAN LEARN SO AS A STATE

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.938
BOARD MEMBER I WOULD CERTAINLY

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:12.178
BE INTERESTED IN STATE WATER.

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:14.213
BACK CERTAIN. IN FIND THAT

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.781
POLAND. CHOIRS WHAT WE'RE

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.016
TRYING TO. AND YOU'VE SEEN THE

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:17.516
OBVIOUSLY SOME FROM SOME

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.251
QUARTERS ANYWAY KERR OF OUR- IN

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:21.887
THAT- NUMBER ONE THE MONEY THAT

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:22.555
IS THE EXTRA MONEY THAT IS

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:24.757
DESIGNED TO. SERVE OUR MOST

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.025
VULNERABLE IN THE FORM OF

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.660
CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDS IN

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:30.229
THE LAKE ARE NECESSARILY

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.064
REACHING THOSE POPULATIONS

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.733
LEAST REPORTEDLY IN THE SCHOOL

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.668
DISTRICTS NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:38.804
TWO. THAT THE EL CAP PROCESS-

00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:40.339
AT LEAST IN SOME QUARTERS IS

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.208
ARGUABLY A CHECK THE BOX

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:45.611
PROCESS AND NOT. NEARLY WHAT WE

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:46.946
ANTICIPATED WHEN WE HAD THE

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:49.749
DEBATE OVER LOCAL CONTROL

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.784
FUNDING AND THE PROCESS FOR

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.686
THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO MA'AM.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:57.056
AND YES I AM I THINK ONE OF THE

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:59.091
INTERESTING DESCRIPTIONS I'VE

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:02.194
HEARD OF LATE S LEARNING

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:04.263
POLICY INSTITUTE. IN CAPS

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.066
LEADING THE L. CFF SHIFT- AS

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:09.335
CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST EXPERIMENT

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:10.870
IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN ITS

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:13.439
HISTORY- OF MOVING. WHAT IS

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.941
ROUGHLY 40% OF THE STATE BUDGET

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:18.044
TO LOCAL DECISION MAKING- AT

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:23.015
THE ELLIE A LEVEL. I DO THINK

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:26.819
THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE-

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:28.387
ATTEMPTS OF ESSENTIALLY

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:30.856
ITERATING SO LCF WAS PASSED IN

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:32.958
TWENTY THIRTEEN- WE JUST

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.360
ADOPTED THE FOURTH ITERATION OF

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:35.928
THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.764
ACCOUNTABILITY- TEMPLATE- IN

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:40.800
CHANGE TWO WEEKS AGO- AT THE

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:42.301
STATE BOARD MEETING AND AT THE

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.570
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR- AND EACH

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.138
ITERATION I THINK IS GETTING.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:48.507
GETTING CLOSER- TO SOMETHING

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:50.342
THAT I THINK REACHES

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.711
ASPIRATIONS THAT ANY OF US HAD

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:55.314
FOR THIS PROCESS- WHAT ONE OF

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.615
THE THINGS THAT I THINK ALSO

00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:58.217
THAT WE ADOPTED IN THE JANUARY

00:11:58.284 --> 00:12:01.387
BOARD PROCESS WAS A REQUIREMENT

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:04.223
AROUND HAVING. ELEAZAR DESCRIBE

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.658
WHAT- THEY HEARD FROM

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:07.093
STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AT THE LOCAL

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:08.094
LEVEL AND THEN ALSO WHAT

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.428
COMPONENTS WERE ADOPTED

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:12.865
INCORPORATED- IT'S KIND OF AN

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:15.468
INTERESTING- REQUIREMENT BUT IT

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:17.169
IT'S ONE THAT IS REALLY I THINK

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.438
GEARED TOWARDS MAKING SURE THAT

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.107
PEOPLE SEE. THE VALUE OF

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.741
PARTICIPATION- THAT THEY

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:25.044
UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR INPUT WAS

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.046
HEARD INCORPORATED AND MOVE THE

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.647
NEEDLE AND THAT'S I THINK A

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:29.982
REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF WHAT

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.283
OF A CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.152
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. SMALL THE

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:34.753
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SHOULD

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.124
ENCOMPASS- I ALSO THINK THERE

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.059
IS. PRIOR TO OUR TIME AN

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:43.662
APPOINTMENT ON THE BOARD- THE-

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:46.398
NEW BUDGET SUMMARY FOR PARENTS-

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:49.435
IS AIMED AT- SIR STREAMLINING

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:51.937
WHAT IS- SERVE UNPACKED FOR

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:53.606
PARENTS IN PARTICULAR SO THAT

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:56.609
WE- WE SAW A BALLOONING OF-

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:58.944
SORT OF THE LENGTH OF EL CAP TO

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:00.846
THE LOCAL LEVEL- IN MY- HOME

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:03.215
SCHOOL DISTRICT OF LAUSD- AT A

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:05.184
CERTAIN POINT IT WAS ALMOST

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.652
THREE HUNDRED PAGES- AND IT'S-

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:08.187
IT'S- REASONABLE TO EXPECT.

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.856
THAT PARENTS SHOULD DECIDE FOR

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:13.726
ALL OF OUR SECONDS AND- YOU

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.561
KNOW GOBBLEDYGOOK OF ACRONYMS

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.329
ENOUGH THAT SUIT. TO KNOW

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:19.431
EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING AND

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:20.099
SO THE BUDGET SUMMARY FOR

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.434
PARENTS I THINK IS AN ATTEMPT

00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:24.470
TO CORRECT FOR THAT AND TO.

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:27.473
SPEAK PLAINLY ABOUT HOW THIS IS

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.241
SHAPING. OPERATE FOR THEIR

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.211
CHILDREN- IS WHAT WE DROPPED IT

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:34.079
IN JANUARY PERFECT I'D I DON'T

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:37.316
THINK SO BUT ARE WE DONE NO. I

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:39.818
THINK- IT IS VERY VERY MUCH MY

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.287
ASPIRATION AND I THINK THAT'S

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:42.755
VERSION OF MANY MEMBERS OF THE

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:45.691
BOARD TO CONTINUE. TO ACTUALLY

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:46.492
LISTEN TO THE STAKEHOLDER

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:49.094
FEEDBACK- AND ALSO ITERATE IN

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.130
THE FUTURE TO MAKE SURE. THAT

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:52.932
THIS IS A ROBUST A PROCESSES

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.633
POSSIBLE AND THAT LOCAL

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.368
DECISION MAKERS HAVE THE

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:58.270
BENEFIT OF KNOWING FROM PARENTS

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.272
FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHAT'S

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.007

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:03.222
SAME. SYSTEM BUT ON A SERIOUS

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:07.126
NOTE FROM. WE TALKED A LITTLE

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:11.597
BIT ABOUT SOME. ETHNIC STUDIES

EITHER POOR MCCUE COMMUNICATION

00:17:16.602 --> 00:17:19.571
LACK OF- INCLUSION JUST KIND OF

00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:21.407
YOUR THOUGHT SON NOT ONLY HOW

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:24.176
WE MOVE FORWARD AS A STATE BUT-

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:26.445
IN YOUR OWN VIEWS BY ETHNIC

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:28.881
STUDIES IS IMPORTANT IN A STATE

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:31.483
AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA THE

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.684
KIND OF RELATED TO THAT

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:35.487
ALTHOUGH. A SEPARATE AREA BUT

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:38.824
HOW WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:43.829
FOCUS ON EARLY EDUCATION- AND

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:46.131
RECOGNIZING PARTICULAR NEEDS

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.966
THAT MIGHT MANIFEST AMONG

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:49.935
PARTICULARLY YOUNG CHILDREN SO

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:51.703
THAT THEY CAN GET THE SUPPORT

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.807
THEY NEED SOONER RATHER THAN

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:57.676
LATER SO. AND YOU WANNA LEAD ON

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.445
IN WILL FOLLOW WITH MISTER

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:03.348
NOVEL THANKS- SIR- FIRST ON

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:05.651
ETHNIC STUDIES. THE FIRST PIECE

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:08.253
I THINK- I THINK THAT THE

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.022
ADOPTION OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES

00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:11.690
CURRICULUM IS GOING TO BE QUITE

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.959
IMPORTANT- TO ARE INCREASINGLY

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:15.961
DIVERSE- SCHOOL CHILDREN ACROSS

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:18.464
THE STATE AND HAVING CHILDREN

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.466
BE ABLE TO SEE THEMSELVES IN

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:21.500
THE HISTORY. AND THE SORT OF

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:24.236
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HAVE BUILT-

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:25.804
THE POWER HOUSE THAT IS OUR

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.840
HOME STATE- IS REALLY

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:32.377
SOMETHING- THAT THAT CAN BE-

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:35.581
SORT OF CABIN REALLY- THERE ARE

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.583
CHAPTERS THAT I THINK WILL BE

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:39.852
UNCONTROVERSIAL ABOUT- THE

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:41.587
FARMWORKERS ABOUT THE

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:45.090
SUFFRAGETTE MOVEMENT ABOUT- THE

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:49.595
AT CHINESE- RAILROAD- AT

00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:52.197
BUILDING. AND CONTRIBUTIONS

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:55.667
ACROSS- MANY SORT OF SEGMENTS

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:56.635
OF A OUR CALIFORNIA HISTORY BUT

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:59.137
ALSO OUR NATIONAL HISTORY. AND

00:18:59.204 --> 00:19:00.739
I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:01.773
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.642
THINK THE PROCESS FOR THE

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:06.278
ETHNIC STUDIES- ADOPTION HAS

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.780
BEEN A LITTLE FADED- TO SAY THE

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:11.450
LEAST- AND I THINK THERE ARE

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.318
ALSO MECHANISMS THAT WERE

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:15.587
ALREADY UNDERTAKING- TO CREATE

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:18.023
A BETTER PROCESS- ON. A SERVE

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.791
ON THE SCREENING COMMITTEE FOR

00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:21.226
THE STATE BOARD- FOR

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.761
APPOINTMENTS TO THE

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:23.228
INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:25.097
COMMISSION. AND ONE OF THE

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:26.064
THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:28.767
VETTING FOR- IS TO MAKE SURE

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:29.735
THAT THERE IS A SPIRIT OF

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:32.804
INCLUSION- A SPIRIT OF OPENNESS

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:34.773
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT- WE

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.475
ASKED ALL THE CANDIDATES WAS.

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:39.545
ON TO DESCRIBE A SITUATION

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:40.913
WHERE THEY HAVE HAPPENED TO

00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:42.681
WORK WELL UNDER PUT IDEA JEEZ

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:44.750
AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY DONE SO

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:48.053
CONSTRUCTIVELY WE WERE JOKING

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.859
AT LUNCH WITH THE THAT. I'M. AT

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:54.359
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A GOOD

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:54.927
COMPROMISE WITH. EVERYONE A

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:58.330
LITTLE BIT UPSET AND TO SELECT

00:19:58.397 --> 00:19:59.264
PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:01.033
ASSUMPTION THAT THEY ARE NOT

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:03.168
GOING TO SORT OF RULE BY FIAT

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:04.536
AND HAVE IT ONLY EXPRESS ONE

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:07.105
VIEWPOINT BUT BE SOMETHING THAT

00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:07.739
SIX MILLION SCHOOL CHILDREN CAN

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:11.043
SEE THEMSELVES IN. AFTER ONE OF.

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:13.045
STERN I THINK CAN DIRECTLY JOB

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:16.048
OF BRING THAT BRING SOME

00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:17.683
CLARITY TO THAT OF THE

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:18.850
COMPLEXITY AROUND ETHNIC

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.686
STUDIES IN MY MIND IS IT A

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:22.421
REFLECTION OF THE QUALITY OF

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:23.989
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE OF THE

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.757
POSITION IN THE VISOR COMMITTEE

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:27.859
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A- REFLECTION OF

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:29.127
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUE.

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:30.362
BECAUSE WE'RE SUCH A DIVERSE

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:32.731
STATE WHEN YOU TRY TO TAKE A

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:34.700
LEGISLATION THAT LEADS TO LAWS

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:35.567
THAT LEADS TO FRAMEWORKS THAT

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:37.336
LEADS TO MODEL CURRICULUM AND

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:38.937
YOU HAVE TO ATTEND TO STATUTES

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:40.439
AND GUIDELINES AND YOU'RE

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.940
TRYING TO CAPTURE THE BREADTH

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:43.809
OF WHAT THE STATE REPRESENTS

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:47.613
AND BRING IT INTO A CONCERTED

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:50.349
DIFFICULT. I THINK THAT- GOING

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:51.917
FORWARD THERE'S BEEN A VESTED

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:53.752
INTEREST AND PARTNERSHIP OR

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:57.422
THAT DIFFERENT THAN THE

00:20:57.489 --> 00:21:00.158
ORIGINAL KIM AND I WERE NOT

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:01.994
PART OF THE REGION. STAY AND

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.096
RISK. GOING FOR THIS ONE CAN AS

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:06.531
MENTIONED ALREADY VETTING- THE

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:07.799
PARTICIPANTS OF THAT ADVISORY

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:09.901
COMMITTEE SO THAT. NUMBER ONE

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:11.336
THEY THEY CAN WORK WITH OTHERS

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:13.171
HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:14.439
NUMBER TWO THEIR OPINIONS

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:16.742
AREN'T THE OPINION OF THAT

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:18.877
REPRESENTS THE- QUALITY OF THE

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.113
STATE THE DIVERSITY THE STATE-

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:24.583
TO- WORKING HANDS THAT THE

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.885
VISOR COMMITTEE IS CLEAR. ABOUT

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.587
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OR ASKING

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:32.391
THEM TO DO- AND THE LIMITATIONS

00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:34.626
THEY HAVE BETTER WITHIN STATUTE.

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:35.961
AND THEN THREE. MAKING SURE

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:38.463
THAT WE HAVE SOMEBODY ON THIS-

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.098
ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT IS

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:42.167
CLEARLY THE LEAD THAT CAN GUIDE

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.302
THIS WORK AND HELP MAKE

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:45.470
DECISIONS FOR THE ADVISORY

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:47.472
GROUP- THAT ARE IN ALIGNMENT

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:49.274
WITH WHAT HE HE U. S. SENATORS

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:51.243
ENVISIONED WHEN WE EMBARKED ON

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:52.911
THIS IDEA. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.246
LEARNING FROM OTHER DISTRICTS

00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:56.014
WHO HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS WORK

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.817
SO- GOING FORWARD I CLEARLY SEE

00:21:58.884 --> 00:22:01.086
GREATER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT-

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.387
GREATER FEEDBACK FROM PARENTS

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:03.155
AND STUDENTS ABOUT WHAT THE

00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:04.690
VALUE AND WHAT THEY NEED TO

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.758
HAVE OR WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AND

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:07.926
THEN ALSO LEARN FROM THOSE WHO

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:08.994
HAVE BEEN HONEST. QUITE LONGER

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:11.830
THAN HALF HEARTEDLY DESIGN

00:22:11.897 --> 00:22:12.898
ETHNIC STUDIES TO MEET THE

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:13.965
NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS OUT OF

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:16.001
THE- HIGHER THEY MAKE IT WORK

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:17.869
WITH A THREE JEEZ. I BELIEVE

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:21.239
GOING FOR THE CLEAR- CLEAR

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:23.608
DIRECTION THAT WILL MAKE SURE

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:30.182
WE GET. EARLY IN SHALL

00:22:30.248 --> 00:22:33.151
EDUCATION FOR SURE I THINK THE

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:35.353
KEY IS THE KEY IS GIVING ACCESS.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.488
OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:38.990
KIDS IS WHY I CAME WHY WANT TO

00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:30.308
STARTLING LAST YEAR. ALSO WAS

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:31.343
FROM THE LEARNING POLICY

IN TERMS OF STANDARDIZED TESTS-

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:43.155
AND WHAT IT CONCLUDED WAS THAT

00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:44.389
ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:45.757

THE DELTA ESSENTIALLY- IS

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:57.702
PRETTY GOOD AND IN FACT IS EVEN

00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:00.138
OUTPACING SOME OTHER- SIMILARLY

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:02.240
SITUATED LARGE STATES. WHERE WE

00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:04.543

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.178
SURE OF STANDARDIZED TESTING IN

ALSO SEE THAT GAP WIDENED YEAR

00:24:26.264 --> 00:24:29.868
AFTER YEAR- AND SO THERE'S A

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:31.937
GAME OF CATCH UP THAT WE ARE

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:34.239
ASKING. OCEAN TO LAY OUT. THE

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.741

MODELED AFTER THE MASTER PLAN

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:25.991
FOR HIGHER ED- I DON'T THINK

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:28.727
THE GOAL BE FOR- THE SCHOOL

00:25:28.793 --> 00:25:29.995

STATE IN TERMS OF EARLY

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:33.932
LEARNING AND I THINK THAT WILL

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:35.267
CONTINUE TO BE SOMETHING THAT

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.002

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:49.214
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:52.017
CALIFORNIA EDUCATE AS MANY
