HERE BAD HERE WILK PRESIDENT DOT WILL PRESENT ALLEN. ARCHULETA. ARCHULETA PRESIDENT BORDERS. BORDERS PRESENT BRADFORD. REFERENCE HERE CHIANG PRESENT THANK PRESIDENT GALGIANI. GALGIANI PRESIDENT GLAZER. HILL HELLO HERE WHAT'S SO. NIELSEN PORTANTINO AIR TWENTY NO HERE RUBIO. WIENER WHERE PRESIDENT. WE HAVE A QUORUM GERMAN. THE SECRETARY KNOWS OF A QUORUM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED OKAY NOW IT'S TIME TO HEAR FROM OUR AUTHOR. GERMAN DODD AND YOU MAY NOT PERCENT SCA SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SCA SIX. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS WHY I DECIDED TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD. I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO GAMBLES WARS LOOKING TO DO SPORTS WAGERING MYSELF. THIS ISN'T FOR A FUN EASY ISSUE EITHER. THE REASONS ARE SIMPLE. I BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A DUTY TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. WE HAVE A DUTY TO BRING ILLEGAL SPORTS WAGERING OUT OF THE SHADOWS IN SUPPORTER COMMUNITIES WITH THE REVENUE THAT WILL BE GENERATED. NEARLY HALF THE LEGALIZE SPORTS WAGERING. NEARLY HALF OF THE NATION EXCUSE ME HAS LEGALIZED SPORTS WAGERING AND WE SHOULD DO IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN A WAY THAT MAXIMIZES BENEFITS TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. WHEN I BECAME CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE THREE YEARS AGO. I SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY FRACTURED RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS EXISTED BETWEEN CARD ROOMS OF THE TRIBES FOR WAY LONG BEFORE I BECAME CHAIR. AS CHAIR OF GEO IN ALONG SIDE CHAIRMAN GRAY WE BELIEVED IT WAS TIME TO TRY TO WORK TOGETHER ON A SOLUTION. I BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATION OF SPORTS WAGERING PROVIDES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP EVERYONE IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY IT'S A PROVIDE AS MUCH REVENUE TO OUR STATE. DURING THIS TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES WHO'LL NEVER AGREE TO A SOLUTION. BUT I HOPE THAT IF YOU TAKE A MOMENT TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THIS BILL IS. UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS YOU WILLCOME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION THAT I HAVE. THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD. INACTION UNDER THIS BILL THE TRIED TO GAIN THE ABILITY TO OFFER CRAPS ROULETTE AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT SPORTS WAGERING BOTH AT THEIR TRIBAL CASINOS AIR AND ONLINE. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW HORSE RACING IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY INDUSTRY AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT MOBILE WAGERING. THIS BILL WILL SIMILAR SIMILARLY AUTHORIZE HORSE RACING COULD CONDUCTS WARTS WAGERING ONLINE AS WELL AS OF THEIR BREAK IN MORTAR LOCATIONS. THE CARD ROOMS WOULD NOT LET ME REPEAT THAT CARD ROOMS WOULD NOT BE AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT SPORTS WAGERING. BUT MY INTENTION IS TO PROVIDE CARD ROOMS WITH CLARITY ON THE GAMES THEY PLAY. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LEGALIZATION OF SPORTS WAGERING NOT ONLY PROVIDES A NEW REVENUE SORTS SOURCE WHICH IS ESTIMATED. AS HIGH AS FIVE HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN A MATURE MARKET. BUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY OUT OF THE SHADOWS. MEMBERS WE MUST BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES SPORTS BETTING. IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF ITS LEGALITY. A VOTE FOR THE LEGALIZATION OF SPORTS WAGERING. IT'S SUPPOSED TO REGULATE THE INDUSTRY TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS IT TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GETS ITS FAIR SHARE. I APPRECIATE THE RECENT OUT REACH FROM TRIBAL LEADERS ESPECIALLY RINCON BAND OF LOOSELY NEO- INDIANS CHAIRMAN BO WAS ATTY. FOR A WILLINGNESS AND COMMITMENT TO ENGAGE IN SUBSTANTIVE GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS TO ADDRESS SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES IN THIS BILL. IT'S A VERY HONORABLE OVERTURE AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER WORK OUT DETAILS ESPECIALLY AROUND THE CAR ROOM ISSUE. BASED ON OUR DEADLINES WE NEED TO MOVE FOR WITH OUR COMMITTEE VOTE TODAY. BUT I HAVE COMMITTED TO COME TO THE TABLE FOR THOSE SUBSTANTIVE GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS AND I WILL NOT BRING THIS BILL UP ON THE FLOOR BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE FOR THOSE DISCUSSIONS. EIGHTY BILL WE BRING TO THE FLOOR WILL HAVE AMENDMENTS TO HELP ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE TRIBES. THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT WORK TODAY. AND I KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF WORK YET TO BE DONE ON THIS ISSUE. I BELIEVE WE CAN ADVANCE A COLLABORATIVE SOLUTION. IT'S A WIN WIN BUT IT ALL STARTS WITH THE COMMITTEE ADVANCING SCA SIX HERE TODAY. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TURN- MISTER CHAIRMAN IT OVER TO SHERMAN GRAY WHO WILL PROVIDE A FEW COMMENTS. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SAID A FEW WORDS ON SCA SIX. HI THIS IS A JOINT EFFORT. ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND SENATOR DODD THE TO RESPECTIVE POLICY COMMITTEE CHAIRS HERE TO STAY LEGISLATURE THIS IS AN ISSUE WE WORKED ON. FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO. THERE'S GONNA BE LAW LOBBYING. AROUND THIS BILL THERE SHOULD BE A LOT OF- MISGUIDED COMMENTS AND ACCUSATIONS ABOUT NOBODY WAS TOLD THIS OR SOMEBODY WASN'T TOLD THAT OR WHATEVER WE CAN TALK ABOUT OTHER THAN SUBSTANCE. THE SUBSTANCE IS SIMPLE HERE WE'VE GOT A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO STRUGGLE WITH. THIS YEAR. SPORTS WORK WAGERING OCCURS IN EACH AND EVERY SENATORS DISTRICT ON THE FOR THERE'S NOT A ONE OF YOU WHO DOESN'T HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY BETTING ON SPORTS. ON ILLEGAL UNREGULATED ONLINE APPS THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO GO ON. THE CHOICE TODAY IS DO WE WANT TO REGULATE THAT MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TAX THAT MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND REYES AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE THAT CAN HELP US NAVIGATE THESE UNCERTAIN AND DIFFICULT TIMES. RIGHT A BETTER PRODUCT FOR THE- SPORTS FAN AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ENJOY SPORTS WAGERING ALSO PROVIDE ANOTHER PRODUCT FOR THE BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE INCLUDE. OUR HORSE RACING FACILITIES. AND OUR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR CASINOS. THEY CURRENTLY ARE UNABLE TO OFFER A VEGAS STYLE PROJECT THIS AMENDMENT WILL ALLOW THEM TO COMPETE HEAD TO HEAD. WITH OUR NEIGHBOR NEVADA AND OFFER A FULL LINE OF GAMES INCLUDING SPORTS WAGERING INCLUDING A CRAPS AND ROULETTE AND SLOT MACHINES THEY WILL BE THE EXCLUSIVE. ENTITY THAT CAN OFFER THAT. AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN TAKE THE REVENUES FROM ONLINE SPORTS WAGERING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND DO A LOT OF GOOD FOR CALIFORNIANS I SAT ON THE FLOOR RECENTLY IT. IS AWFULLY HARD FOR ANY OF US TO GO HOME AND EXPLAIN TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE RESPONDED TO THE GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS. BY CUTTING HEALTHCARE. LET'S TAKE EVERY STEP WE CAN MEMBERS TO ENSURE THAT WE- DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THOSE CUTS THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES OF DIFFICULT CHOICES ARE GOING TO BE HAVE TO BE MADE THAT'S A CERTAIN. BUT LET'S NOT LET LET'S TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE THAT. LET'S MOVE THIS FORWARD LET'S BRING ALL THE PARTIES TO THE TABLE. LET'S PUT ASIDE SOME OF THE SILLY LOBBYING AND GET TO THE SUBSTANCE. OF WHAT CAN BENEFIT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WHAT CAN BENEFIT OUR HORSE RACING INDUSTRY ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY- AND LET THE TWO CHAIRMEN OF THE TWO POLICY COMMITTEES DO THE IMPORTANT WORK TO BRING YOU MEMBERS A BILL ON THE FLOOR. THAT WILL HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GRAY. NOW WE WILL MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LINK THAT HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND NEW CLEANING PROTOCOLS. COMMITTEES WILL INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY ACCORDINGLY EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED A TOTAL OF TEN MINUTES ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY MISS LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO NAME. AFFILIATION AND THE POSITION ON THE MEASURE. CHAIRMAN DOT IT LEAVE THE YOU HAVE SHOWN LAYING IN ERNIE HERNANDEZ WHO ARE HERE IN THE GALLERY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AS WELL AS CHRIS GROVE ON THE PHONE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G REPRESENTING&lt;/c&gt; THE COALITION OF SUPPORTERS OF ESSAYS SIX- I THANK YOU AND HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR THE AUTHORS FOR THE COMMITTEE. AND DEEPEST RESPECT FOR THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO EXPRESS CONCERNS WITH THIS LEGISLATION. I BELIEVE CENTER DOT IN A SEVEN GRAY HAVE PROBABLY ARTICULATED HOW IMPORTANT THIS MEASURE IS AND HOW IT MEETS THE TEST OF BOTH SOUND PUBLIC POLICY AND FAIR PUBLIC POLICY TO ALL THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS. THE MEASURE MEETS THE STANDARD OF SOUND PUBLIC POLICY FOR AT LEAST THREE REASONS. ONE AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE IT WILL PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO THE STATE. TO HELP AVOID DEVASTATING CUTS TO IMPORTANT SERVICES. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN YEAR ONE. AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUTURE YEARS. ALLOWING CALIFORNIA TO COMPETE AGAINST TWENTY THREE OTHER STATES WHO HAVE AUTHORIZED SPORTS WAGERING ALREADY. NUMBER TWO IT WILL HELP TO ELIMINATE THE CURRENT ILLEGAL SPORTS WAGERING MARKET. ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND GIVE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS A SAFE LEGAL AND WELL REGULATED MANNER IN WHICH TO PARTICIPATE. IT WILL HELP TO PRESERVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOCAL REVENUE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE ALSO FACING THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CODE NINETEEN TO THEIR ECONOMIES. THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU ALSO MEETS THE STANDARD OF A FAIR AND EQUITABLE POLICY FOR THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED. ONE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS CHOOSING IN SOME CASES TO POSE AS PLEASURE WOULD BENEFIT BY A THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT SPORTS WAGERING AT THEIR TRIBAL CASINOS. IN THE SAME MANNER IN WHICH. THE TITLE INITIATIVE ALLOWED. BE THEY RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO CONDUCT ONLINE SPORTS WAGERING BUT ONLY IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. THIS MEASURE DOES NOT MANDATE THE CONDUCT OF ONLINE WAGERING AT ALL. NUMBER THREE THE MEASURE FURTHER ALLOWS TRIBAL CASINOS TO OFFER THE GAMES OF ROULETTE AND CRAPS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. ANOTHER WAY IT CREATES AN EQUITABLE POLICY. IS FOR CALIFORNIA'S LICENSE CARD CLUBS. IN THIS CASE IT WILL SIMPLY ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE OFFERING THE SAME GAMES THEY ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING. THAT AUTHORIZED TO PLAY IN THE SAME MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY PLAYED. WHAT CARD CLUBS WOULD STRONGLY DESIRE TO ALSO OFFER SPORTS WAGERING. THIS MEASURE DOES NOT ALLOW THAT AND CARD ROOMS ARE STILL SUPPORTIVE OF THE MEASURE. FOR THE VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUES WHO STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE IT OFFERS AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF ELIMINATING ILLEGAL WAGERING ON THEIR SPORTING EVENTS. AND PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR SPORTS. AS ALSO MENTION BY THE AUTHORS CALIFORNIA'S HORSE RACING TRACKS BENEFIT AS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER SPORTS WAGERING IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE INITIATIVE. ORIGINALLY AUTHORED BY SOME TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE ALREADY AUTHORIZED ONLINE WAGERING ON HORSE RACING WHICH EXISTS TODAY. SO WHAT'S MISSING FROM THIS MEASURE. THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE TRIBAL EDITION. THAT IS A PROVISION CREATING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WHICH IS A TOOL TO DISRUPT IF NOT TOTALLY DESTROYED CALIFORNIA'S LICENSE CARD ROOMS AS WE KNOW THAT. SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE REAL WORLD THAT THIS MEASURE PASSES AND IS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. ONE TRIBAL CASINOS WILL BENEFIT BY OFFERING SPORTS WAGERING CRAPS AND ROULETTE. TWO CAR CLUBS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AS WE KNOW THEM TODAY. THREE THE STATE WILL REALIZE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN GREATLY NEEDED REVENUE. AND FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE WILL BE PRESERVED. ALL OF THOSE ARE POSITIVE RESULTS AND DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER. YOU MAY HEAR FROM OPPONENTS TODAY THAT THIS MEASURE ACTUALLY GIVES THE CAR CLUBS A SUBSTANTIAL EXPANSION OF GAMBLING BY ALLOWING THEM TO EXIST AND PLAY THE GAMES THAT THEY CURRENTLY ARE AUTHORIZED TO PLAY. I WOULD SUGGEST DON'T BE FOOLED BY THOSE ARGUMENTS. CERTAIN NUMBERS OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT SUIT AGAINST THE STATE AND CARD CLUBS MAKING THIS ARGUMENT. THEY HAVE NOT AVAILED IN THOSE SIX. THIS MEASURE SIMPLY SURE IS THAT CARD CLUBS AS WE KNOW THEM RIGHT NOW CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST. YOU MAY ALSO HEAR THAT ONLINE WAGERING WOULD ALLOW MINORS TO WAGER. HORSE RACING'S TWENTY YEAR HISTORY OF ONLINE WAGERING IS PROVEN THAT WALL. THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TO ASSURE WAGERING OCCURS ONLY BY ADULTS AND IN FACT IN THE TWENTY YEARS OF HISTORY THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN ALLEGATION MINERS USING THE INTERNET TO WAGER ON HORSE RACING. TO SUMMARIZE. A VOTE IN FAVOR THIS MEASURE HELPS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE STATE. IT ALSO HELPS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROVIDES TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WITH ADDITIONAL GAMING OPPORTUNITIES. PROVIDES HORSE RACING WITH HELP IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND ALLOWS CARD CLUBS TO CONTINUE TO EXIST. IN SOME WAYS THIS MEASURE IS AND COULD BE A WIN WIN FOR ALL OF THE VARIOUS ENTITIES INCLUDING THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE DO RESPECT CONCERNS RAISED BY TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. WE LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO THE GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS MENTIONED BY BOTH THE AUTHORS. AND HOPE TO MAKE THIS MEASURE REALITY IN A WAY THAT. HAS AN AGREEMENT AND STRONG SUPPORT BY ALL THE PARTIES. WITH ME ON THE PHONE IS CHRIS GROW FROM THE HIGHLY RESPECTED ECONOMIC FORECASTING FIRM OF OTHERS AND CRAZY. WHO WILL SPEAK TO THE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE NUMBERS THAT THE CITY CAN EXPECT. AND MISTER HERNANDEZ CITY MANAGER OF THE CITY OF ALL AND GARDENS WHO WILL TESTIFY ON THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF ALLOWING CARD ROOMS TO BE ELIMINATED. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK- MISTER GROW WAS ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU MISTER LAYING. CAN WE CALL MISTER GROW ON THE PHONE. MISTER KROEGER LINE IS OPEN PARDON ME JUST A MOMENT. KRYCEK GAVE ME A CALIFORNIA BASED RESEARCH FIRM WHERE I HAD UP OUR SPORTS BETTING PRACTICE WE HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF APPEARING PREVIOUSLY IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS OUR RECENT WORK ON THE CALIFORNIA SPORTS BETTING QUESTION. I AM SPEAKING TODAY TO SUMMARIZE OUR LATEST PROJECTIONS FOR IT LEGAL SPORTS BETTING IN CALIFORNIA. ARE NOW OFFICIALLY COMMISSION BY THE NONPROFIT GROUP YOU KNOW ON THE GAMBLING POWER GRAB. THE ONLY INPUT THAT ANGIE PC PROVIDED. WITH POLICY PARAMETERS AND TIME FRAME FOR THE ANALYSIS. THE GROUP OTHERWISE HAD NO INPUT INTO OR CONTROL OVER OUR FINAL RESEARCH PROJECT. OUR REPORT AND ALL OF THE UNDERLYING MODELS HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE I WILL KEEP MY TESTIMONY GRIEF AND FOCUSED ON THREE KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM OUR ANALYSIS. TAKE AWAY ONE. POLICY CHOICES IMPACT ILLEGAL SPORTS BETTING MARKET CAPTURE. OUR ANALYSIS OF THE STATUS QUO FOR LEGAL SPORTS BETTING IN THE UNITED STATES LEADERS TO CONCLUDE THAT POLICY CHOICES ESPECIALLY THE QUESTIONS OF WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOW ONLINE SPORTS BETTING AND HOW TO STRUCTURE TAXES AND FEES PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN DETERMINING HOW MUCH OF THE ILLEGAL MARKET DEMAND IS CAPTURED BY LEGAL SPORTS BETTING. THANK YOU CALIFORNIA'S BETTING MARKET COULD RAMP UP QUICKLY. THANK YOU NINA CONDUCIVE TAX AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY TO RAMP UP FASTER THAN A TYPICAL MARK. THAT MEANS THE STATE CAN POTENTIALLY REALIZE MATERIAL SHORT TERM REVENUE FROM LEGAL SPORTS BETTING ESPECIALLY VIA UP FRONT LIKE THE- SPECIFICALLY WE FORECAST THAT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF ACTIVITY. LEGAL SPORTS BETTING IN CALIFORNIA COULD GENERATE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN GROSS GAMING REVENUES. WHICH WOULD FLOW THROUGH TO TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT TAX AND BE REVENUE TO THE STATE. THIRD AND FINAL TAKE AWAY IS THE CLIFORNIA COULD EASILY BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE THE SPORTS BETTING MARKETS IN THE WORLD. AGAIN ENDING A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT WE BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT OF CALIFORNIANS DYNAMIC ECONOMY DEMONSTRATED AFFINITY FOR GAMBLING A DEEP AND VERY SPORTS FANDOM AND THE STATE'S FLAGSHIP STATUS IN THE U. S MARKET WE'LL ALL CONTRIBUTE TO CREATE A LEGAL SPORTS BETTING MARKET THAT STATE IN THE- TOP TIER. I'M GLOBAL MARKETS ON. AFTER THE BASIC. SPECIFICALLY WE FORECAST MARKET MAJORITY LEGAL SPORTS BETTING IN CALIFORNIA WILL GENERATE APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL GROSS GAMING REVENUE FLOWING THROUGH TO APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL DIRECT AND TAX REVENUE FOR THE STATE. WE READILY ADMIT THAT REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ON THE ULTIMATE FIVE OF CALIFORNIA SPORTS FOR THE DOCTOR TO. NO ONE IS ARGUING ABOUT THE AMOUNT CALL INTO THE NUMBER. GIVEN THE RIGHT POLICY CONDITIONS THERE IS LITTLE CREDIBLE DEBATE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE LARGEST SPORTS BETTING MARKET UNITED STATES. AND ALSO A LITTLE DEBATE THE CALIFORNIA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE MAJOR SPORTS BETTING MARKETS ON AN ADULT PER CAPITA BASIS IN THE WORLD. I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND I AM AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS NOW FOR CALLING THIS HEARING. THANK YOU MISTER GROW. NOW THE GALLERY BELIEVES WE HAVE MISTER HERNANDEZ. FOR STATE WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON AUDIBLE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS THERE ANY HERNANDEZ I AM THE CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF WEINGARTEN'S NAME SPEAKING TO IN THAT CAPACITY. THE CITY IS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY LOCATED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH 77% LATINO POPULATION. WITH MEDIAN INCOMES AND EDUCATION LEVELS ARE LOWER. THAN THE COUNTY AND STATE AVERAGES. I AM HERE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT SCA SIX AS A PROVIDE CERTAINTY. BUT CONTINUED REVENUES JOBS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT OUR CITY AND THOSE LIKE. CAN RELY ON TO CONTINUE TO STRIVE. THE GARDENS CASINO WHICH HAS OPERATE IN THE CITY FOR THE PAST TWENTY TWO YEARS IS A CRITICAL PARTNER TO THE OUR COMMUNITY. IT HAS SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT AND HAS PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE CITY'S ABILITY TO FIGHT CRIME AND ROLL BACK MAJOR GANG ISSUES. THE GUARDS CASINO IS LARGE EMPLOYER IN THE CITY. AND HAS HELPED TRANSFORM WEINGARTEN'S COMMUNITY IN A POSITIVE MANNER. AND PROVIDES RESIDENTS AND OUR NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES WOULD GOOD PAYING JOBS AS WELL AS A RESOURCES. TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL AND QUALITY OF LIFE MUNICIPAL SERVICES. GAMING TAX REVENUES DERIVE FROM THE GUARDS CASINO MAKE UP OVER WE SIMPLY CANNOT PROVIDE ESSENTIAL AND QUALITY OF LIFE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AT THE LEVEL WE HAVE NOW WITHOUT THIS CRITICAL REVENUE SOURCE. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE HAVE PAINFULLY LEARNED WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE WITHOUT THE GARDENS CASINO AND THE REVENUES THAT GENERATES. AND I GOT TO TELL YOU THAT THE HOUSE LOOKS VERY BLEAK THE CITY HAS ALREADY ISSUED LAYOFF NOTICES AS IN THE UNFORTUNATE PROCESS OF SIGNIFICANT ELIMINATING. AND ARE REDUCING SERVICES. THE CITY WILL HAVE TO BALANCE THE KNOWN LOSSES OF MORE THAN FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE RESERVE FUNDS AND THE REDUCTION OR ELIMINATION OF QUALITY OF LIFE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THESE KNOWN LOSSES ALREADY REPRESENT ABOUT 21% OF THE CITY'S BUDGET. THE REDUCTION ELIMINATION POLLY LIKE PROGRAMS WILL INCLUDE SENIOR NEW SERVICES TO INCLUDE PROGRAMMING TRANSPORTATION AND EXCURSIONS. YOUTH ACTIVITIES AND SPORTS NONPROFIT PARTNERSHIPS. RECREATIONAL HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY CLASSES. AND EVEN ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. FURTHER LOSSES WOULD BE DEVASTATING I COULD SPELL IT SHUT DOWN OF THE EVEN ESSENTIAL SERVICES. SUCH AS IMPACT AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND COULD EVEN MEAN ON CORPORATION OF THE CITY AS WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO PROVIDE SERVICE. FIRED YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS CA SIX TO PRESERVE THE REVENUES THAT PROVIDE THE JOB SAFETY AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR CAR CLUB CITIES.

WE TRY TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE LIMITED TIME GIVEN TO US FOR BY TESTIMONY OBVIOUSLY WE COULD SPEND FAR MORE THAN TEN MINUTES ON THIS. WE HAVE SEVERAL TRIBAL CHAIRS CALLING AN EXPLOSIVE SERIOUS OPPOSITION OF THEIR SOVEREIGN TRIBES AS THE ASICS I'M CONFIDENT YOU'LL HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THEM. AFTER SEEING HIS PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST THURSDAY. AND LEARNING OF THIS QUICKLY SCHEDULED HEARING LAST FRIDAY. I DID TRY TO GET IN CONTACT WITH CHAIRMAN DODD ANY IN OUR EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS AND ISSUES WITH HIM DIRECTLY SO THERE'S WON'T BE ANY SURPRISE TO HIM. AND I BELIEVE THAT. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY TRIED IN FACT I DON'T EVEN TRY IT WILL APPROVE. SB. EIGHTY SIX. SB EIGHTY SIX ALL. SPORTS WAGERING TO TRY TO GOVERNMENT AND- EXTRA SAY IN THE TRI TO TRY. ARE THE BEST WHICH IS T. TO A- AS HEIDI BY. I NOTING DECADES OF THE- AND PLAN. RESOURCES WE AGREE WITH. SCA HOW TRIBE GOV. EXPERTISE IN RIGHT. OPERATE BUT ALSO NO TROUBLE GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTION TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BECAUSE HER BODY OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND JOBS TWENTY BILLION AND ECONOMIC OUTPUT NINE BILLION EMPLOYEE WAGES. AND THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IN THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALL FROM LEGAL. GAMING. REVENUES LEGAL. THAT'S CA SIX REGULAR YOU CAN GREAT THING THE TRIBE YOU DOOR BUT THE SAME TIME IT A MAN'S CAL CON. STRIP AWAY THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT A TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO OFFERED PRE GAMES THERE ARE CONTACTS YOU CURED WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP ONE EIGHT. SHE A SIXGIVE THE RIGHT THE CARD ROOMS TO OPERATE ILLEGAL BANK GAMES IN PLAIN SIGHT GENERATED REVENUES THAT RIGHTFULLY SHOULD QUOTA TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN VIA OUR CONTACT. ULTIMATELY FLOWING BACK TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND NON GAMING TRIBES WHY DID THE SPORTS WAGERING BILL CONTAINED A GIFT TO BRING GAMES. THE CARD ROOM INDUSTRY WHOSE ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL IS BUILT AROUND SIR COMPETING CALIFORNIA LAW FOR ITS OWN BENEFIT AND THE DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. YOU TALKED ABOUT NOT HAVING A SOLUTION OR TRYING TO COME TO A SOLUTION BETWEEN CARD ROOMS AND TRIES TO SOLUTION SIMPLE CARGO SHIP GAME LEGALLY NOT CIRCUMVENT THE LAW. WHY DO WHY DID OF SPORTS WAGERING BUILT. IT REWARDS ARE COURTROOM INDUSTRY WERE SERIOUS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY MAJOR VIOLATIONS OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAW OR ON COVERED WITH ALARMING REGULARITY INTENTIONALLY LOW EXPRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF SPORTS WAGERING THAT PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS FROM SHADIA LEGAL SPORTS WAGERING OPERATORS FTA SIX AUTHORIZES ONLINE SPORTS WAGERING. ON MARCH FOURTH WAGERING RAISES MANY REGULATORY CHALLENGES INCLUDING HOW TO IDENTIFY PREVENT MINORS FROM GAMBLING HOW TO IDENTIFY MISSUS PROBLEM GAMBLERS AND HOW TO EFFECTIVELY POLICE AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED AT THE STATION TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT DIRECT INTERACTION WITH TRAINED GAMING FACILITIES STAFF IF YOU ARE TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT STRONG AND EFFECTIVE SPORTS WAGERING REGULATIONS. IN AUTHORIZED BEING ONLINE SPORTS WAGERING SEEMS LIKE A POOR TOWARDS THE FTA SIX FACT SHEET CONTAINS TAX ESTIMATES THAT APPEARED TO BE COULD BARELY OVERESTIMATED ESPECIALLY IN THE SCOLDED NINETEEN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WHAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE LIMITED DISPOSAL INCOME. TAX REVENUE GENERATED FROM THESE MEASURES WILL HAVE NO MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE. MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICIT. WELL BREAK A MORE. FORTY DURING HIS AUTHOR NUTRITIONAL ONLINE WAGERING WORKS LIKE THE OF BRICK AND MORTAR SO TO PROTECT THEIR INVESTMENT AND CREATE CALIFORNIA JOBS IT APPEARS THAT ARE OUT OF STATE SPORTS WE OUT OF STATE SPORTS WAGERING PLATFORMS WILL BE THE BIG WINNERS SB SIX. BECOMES LAW FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE AS NOTED ARE OPPOSITION LETTER WE ASK YOU CHAIRMAN DODD TO WITHDRAW SCA SIX THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GROOVY DO WE HAVE MISTER JEFF FATHER ON THE PHONE. TELL YOUR PRESENT OKAY. OUR MODERATOR HE'S ACTUALLY IN THE GALLERY. GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN% DIED IN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEFF BUTLER I AM A PARTNER IN THE LAW FIRM OF DENTON'S U. S. L. O. P. AND REPRESENT THE YORKSHIRE D. HE WENT TO NATION. DUE TO THE LIMITATION OF THE NUMBER SPEAKERS TODAY HOWEVER. I SPEAK NOT ONLY ON BEHALF. OF YOUR CITY. FOR MORE BROADLY FOR VARIOUS. TRIBES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA INDIAN COUNTRY. MY FIRST ONE EXPLAIN THAT WHAT IS CA SIX DOES IS LEGALIZE PATENTLY ILLEGAL CONDUCT. CARTER'S LIKE TO SAY THEIR% GAMES ARE PERFECTLY LEGAL AND INDEED THE SCA SIX FACT SHEET CLAIMS THE MEASUREWOULD ALLOW CARD ROOMS TO CONTINUE TO PLAY THE GAMES THEY ARE CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO PLAY. NEITHER STAY IS TRUE. MOST OBVIOUS IF CARD ROOMS ARE ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO PLAY THOSE GAMES NO CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WOULD BE NEEDED. SO HOW ARE THOSE GAMES ILLEGAL. PENAL CODE SECTION THREE THREE ZERO PROHIBITS BANK GAMES PLAYED WITH CARDS. A BANK GAME HAPPENS WHEN ONE PLAYER ACCESS  BANK TAKING ON ALL COMERS PAIN WINTERS I COLLECTING FROM LOSERS. THAT PROBATION HAS EXISTED IN CALIFORNIA SINCE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS RAISED TO A CONSTITUTIONAL LEVEL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. WHEN THE CONSTITUTION WAS AMENDED TO PREFER GAMES LIKE THOSE PLAYED IN THE BOTTOM AND TO JERSEY. AN EXAMPLE OF THESE PROHIBIT GAMES AS A BLACKJACK YOU WOULD SEE IN A LAS VEGAS OR INDIAN CASINO. WHERE YOU PLAY AGAINST THE DEALER. CALIFORNIA LAW HAS ANOTHER MUCH NEWER PROVISION PENAL CODE SECTION THREE THREE ZERO POINT ONE ONE. THIS IS A GAME IS NOT BANK. IF THE BANKER POSITION ROTATES CONTINUOUSLY AMONG THE PLAYERS. THAT MEANS THOSE GAMES CAN BE PLAYED AND CARD ROOMS IF BUT ONLY IF THE BANKER POSITION MOVED ALL THE TIME BETWEEN THE PLAYERS PREVENTING ANY ONE OF THEM. FROM ACTING AS A BANK. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU. I'VE BEEN TO A LOCAL CAR ROOM BUT THE CARD GAMES PLAYED THERE ARE EXACTLY LIKE THOSE PLAYED IN LAS VEGAS OR INDIAN CASINOS THERE'S NO ROTATION OF THE PLAYER DEALER POSITION AMONG THE PLAYERS AT THE TABLE. AS A PENAL CODE REQUIRES. THE PERSON ACTING AS A BANK IN A CAR ROOMS CALLED A THIRD PARTY PROPOSITION PLAYER. OR PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF THE TERM TPP WHICH IS A SHORTHAND FOR THAT. THANK YOU MIGHT WONDER. IF THE LAW IS THAT CLEAR. HOW DID THE CARD ROOMS GET AROUND THE IRON CLAD PROHIBITION. AGAINST BANK GAINES. THE ANSWER IS THROUGH AN INFAMOUS DOCUMENT KNOWN. AS THE LYTLE LETTER. ROBERT LYTLE WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE'S BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL THE AGENCY THAT REGULATES CARBS. ON DECEMBER TWENTY OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN LYELL WROTE TO THE PRESIDENTS OF TWO GROUPS LOBBYING FOR CARDS. IN THAT LETTER LYTLE IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY SAID THE PENAL CODE SECTION THREE THREE ZERO POINT ONE ONE. DID NOT REQUIRE ACTUAL ROTATION OF THE BANKER POSITION BUT ONLY THE OFFER. OF THAT POSITION TO THE OTHER PLAYERS AT THE TABLE. THERE WERE TWO PROBLEMS WITH THE LIGHT LETTER FIRST IT CONTRADICTED THE LAW. THE SECOND PROBLEM WAS IS PROVIDENCE. TEN DAYS AFTER ISSUING THE LETTER MR LYTLE WENT TO WORK FOR A CORPORATE. IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE BUREAU LINES FORMER EMPLOYER. FILED A FORMAL ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM ALLEGING HE NEGOTIATED FOR THAT CARD ROOM JOB BEFORE HE LEFT THE BUREAU AND THEREFORE BEFORE HE ISSUED THE LETTER. THE BUREAU CONCLUDED THAT LYTLE ACTED AND I'M QUOTING HERE FOR PERSONAL GAIN AND THE GAME OF THOSE WHOM HE CAME TO REPRESENT. THAT HE ABANDONED THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE AGENCY AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT HE SERVED. AND THAT HE IS NOT A PERSON OF GOOD CHARACTER. HONESTY AND INTEGRITY. THROUGH JULY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SETTLEMENT OF THE ACCUSATION LYTLE WAS STRIPPED OF HIS GAME LICENSES HE ADMITTED HE WASN'T QUALIFIED FOR BUREAU LICENSURE AND AGREE TO A LIFETIME BAN. IN ALSO AGREED TO PAY A SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE. NO THIS ISN'T JUST THE TRIBES INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW. OR THE FACTS HERE. ON DECEMBER THIRD OF LAST YEAR THE BUREAU ISSUED CONCEPT REGULATORY LANGUAGE THAT IS SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO FORCE THE ROTATION. OF THE PLAYER DEALER POSITION. EVERY TWO HANDS. LESS OBVIOUSLY IT TOURNEY GENERAL AGREES THE LIGHT LETTER IS WRONG ON THE LAW. NOW LET'S TURN BACK TO SCA SIX IN AMENDMENT NINE THE MEASURE PROVIDES THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF STATE LAW. LAYERS IN CAR ROOMS ARE ALLOWED TO WAGER AGAINST EACH OTHER. WHICH MEANS THAT HE BANKING GAME DOES NOT INCLUDE THE SITUATION WHERE THE PLAYER DEALER WAGERS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED THAT EACH PARTICIPANT IS OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE PLAYER DEALING. STATED MORE STARKLY SCA SIX HITS WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A TRY FACTOR IF YOU'LL PARDON THE PUN. ONE ILLEGITIMACY IS PATENTLY ILLEGAL CONDUCT AND IN DOING SO OVERTURNS NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OF PROHIBITION IN THE PENAL CODE AGAINST BANK GAMES AS WELL AS A CONSTITUTIONAL BAN. ON SUCH GAMES. TO IT WIPES OUT ATTORNEY GENERAL BESET US CURRENT EFFORTS TO FORCE THE CARD ROOMS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW THERE BY REWARDING ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN VIOLATING THE LAW FOR MANY YEARS. AND THREE CONSTITUTIONAL LIES'S THE LYTLE LETTERS SORTED OFFER STANDARD. NONE OF THOSE ACTIONS IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THIS GREAT STATE. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH WAR HELLO FEW MORE SPECIFICS ON AN ISSUE THE CHAIRMAN GROOVY RACE THE VERY REAL CONCERN ABOUT EXPANDING THE GAMING RIGHTS. OF A SEGMENT OF THE GAMING INDUSTRY THAT IS DEMONSTRATED EXCEEDINGLY SERIOUS REGULATORY PROBLEMS LET ME SAY JUST TWO RECENT EXAMPLES OF MANY AND THEY ARE MANY AND WITH APOLOGIES TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO THE CITY MANAGER OF THE- CITY OF HAWAIIAN GARDEN SO WE'LL START THERE.

AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE THAT TESTIFIED IN BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS SO AT THESE TIMES APPROPRIATE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SENATOR GORGEOUS. THANK YOU. THIS IS BEEN A BIT OF A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME- I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO- AND- SENATOR DODD AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY- FOR THE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD- IN THE LAST- TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN PARTICULAR- RESULTS IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME. I AM IN MY SECOND YEAR IN SENATE BUT EVEN THOUGH THIS ISSUE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES I HADN'T HAD OCCASION TO FULLY APPRECIATE- THE POSITIONS IN THE ARGUMENTS AND THE FACTS AND HISTORY OF THIS MATTER. BUT THINGS THAT I'VE LOOKED ARE THAT. DRIVE IN CARD ROOMS ARE CERTAINLY IN A PROTRACTED BATTLE. I THINK THAT IS THAT IS PRETTY PRETTY CLEAR HERE. THAT THERE ARE TWO LAWSUITS ARE UNDER WAY- THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD. OF THE OF THE COURTS- RENDERING DECISIONS YET. WHAT ALSO IS THAT WE'VE HAD THREE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S- WHO HAVE HAD JURISDICTION ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T PROVIDED ENOUGH CLARITY TO RESOLVE SO THE MOST OUTSTANDING THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED NOW AS AN ATTORNEY- I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON THESE ISSUES AND I ALSO RELY ON- FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE LITTLE DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE. I WANT THINGS THAT A LOT YEAR WAS POSE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS TO LEAD COUNSEL. SPECIFICALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND. DOES THE EXCLUSIVITY OF EXIST. DO CARD ROOMS PRACTICE IN ENGAGING GAMES THAT ARE IN VIOLATION OF A CONTACT A NUMBER OF OTHERS. WHAT I WAS SURPRISED IS THAT I GOT ZERO RESPONSE FROM OUR LEGAL ADVISERS IN THE WRIST IN THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE IT WAS EXPLAINED. IT WAS EXPLAINED AWAY. THAT BECAUSE THIS MATTER WAS IN LITIGATION THAT THEY WOULD NOT- PINE OR PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO IT NOW FROM A LEGISLATOR STANDPOINT I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. THAT IF WE ARE REALLY GOING ON UNDERSTANDING AN ISSUE AND EVEN IF ONE IS CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF LITIGATION THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO GET ANSWERS OF MARLEY BERMAN SO THAT'S A PERSONAL GRIEVANCE ON ON. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN POLICY. ONE THAT I BELIEVE DESERVES A LOT OF EXAMINATION IN A LOT OF EXPLANATION AND A LOT OF- BOXES GETTING CHECKED ON THE DUE DILIGENCE THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE EXPECTED IN A- ISSUE THIS. I GOT THE BILL ANALYSIS YESTERDAY EVENING. I'M STILL I'M SCRATCHING MY HEAD HERE I'M JUST I'M ADDING UP THE CHALLENGES NO I UNDERSTAND THAT COVERT IS CHANGED VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING THE FACT THAT THERE WERE. WEARING MASKS IN IN A PORTION OF US ARE IN THIS ROOM- AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE STAFFER IN EACH OF OUR OFFICES EVERYTHING BEING DONE REMOTELY AND PROTESTERS FOR TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW AND HAVE BEEN- MAKING SURE. OF THAT. I UNDERSTAND. THINGS WE'RE- BUT IT DOESN'T OBVIATE THE NEED TO GET INFORMATION IN A TIMELY FASHION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE INFORMED- JUDGMENTS ON OR AT LEAST ALLOW US TO GET FOLLOW UP- EIGHT THREE SATISFIED. I HAPPEN TO BE AN ALL IN. I HAPPEN TO BE OF THE OPINION THAT. NGUYEN REASONABLE ALL COME TOGETHER EVEN IF THEY ARE STAUNCHLY PROTECTING THEIR JURISDICTION THEIR TERRITORY OR THEIR REVENUE SOURCE. THAT THERE IS A SOLUTION TO BE HAVE. IT BAFFLES ME TO THINK THAT WE CANNOT FIND A WAY FOR THESE PARTIES TO COME TOGETHER WHETHER IT BE IN A REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT FOR BETTER MORE LIKE FULL UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE PARTIES CAN OPERATE FREELY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. NOW WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD BY CERTAIN FOLKS IN THIS GOES BACK TO THE HE SAID SHE SAID EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE EXT- THAT I'VE HAD ON THIS ISSUE IT THAT. NO THIS CONTACTED- SOME OF THESE PEOPLE AND THEY'VE NEVER HAD A SEAT AT THE TABLE SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT'S THE- AND OTHERS ARE STAYING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY PATENTLY FALSE. WHO DO I BELIEVE I MEAN THIS IS LITERALLY THE IT IS SHOWERED IN A GRAY ZONE OF MISINFORMATION FALSE NARRATIVES AND FALSE CHOICES FOR THAT MATTER. I BELIEVE THE PARTIES NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT GIVEN CODE WITHIN THE PROTESTS IN THE TIMELINE OF BRINGING A BALLOT ISSUE FOR TO FORWARD HAS LEFT US WITH LITTLE ROOM TO NEGOTIATE AND MANEUVER. EVEN IF AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED APPROVE IT SO WE CAN BEGIN NEGOTIATING THAT'S NOT REALLY MY STYLE AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE AND THE SOPHISTICATION THE BODY OF THE ISSUE. BUT SHOULD THIS BEFORE TO STAY IN SPEC INSPECT IT WILL. ONE ONE OR TWO THINGS THAT CAN MAKE THIS BETTER. IS THAT WE REFINE THE FARM THAT THE FUNDING FOR BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING TO GO INTO A GENERAL FUND A WELFARE FUND- TO BE GONE AFTER BY A VARIETY OF FOLKS AS THE SEARCH COMING IN. I THINK WE'LL BE BETTER SERVED IF WE FORCE AND ARTICULATION OF WHAT OR THE OR THE RECIPIENT AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. CATION HIGHER IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER AND MORE BENEFICIAL TO CALIFORNIANS IF WE KNEW WHERE THIS FUN MONEY WAS GOING TO GO AND LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES WE TALK ABOUT KOBE NINETEEN- YOU KNOW IT SHOWING US THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE IN IN THE RED FOR A SIGNIFICANT TIME AHEAD. THE ESTIMATIONS OF FOR HUNDRED MILLION. IS THE FACT THAT WERE FIFTY FOUR BILLION IN THE RED SO CAN THIS BE HELPFUL YES. WILL THIS CHANGE OUR ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. PROBABLY NOT THIS IS ONE OF MANY SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS A WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE AS A BODY ON WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE VERSES ARE WANTS WHAT OUR PRIORITIES AS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS- IT. ALSO WE MOVE FORWARD AS A STATE ALL. MY CONCERN IS THAT IS THIS MOVES FORWARD WE TALKED ABOUT MAKING THIS ACTIVATED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY WITH ALL THE REGULATIONS- THAT WOULD GO ALONG BEHIND IT PROBABLY LOOKING AT ANOTHER YEAR THERE AFTER. MY CONCERN IS THAT THE TRIBES ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS TO COURT IN THIS WILL BE STUCK IN LITIGATION FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME. SO ONE OF COMBINATIONS THAT I WOULD HAVE IS THAT IF THIS DOESN'T PASS FORWARD TODAY OR DOES IT PASSED THE SENATE WERE THE ENTIRE PROCESS. THAT WE IMMEDIATELY READMISSION EIGHT. A FULL IN COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS SO NO ONE CAN EVER SAY THAT THEY WEREN'T AT THE TABLE. ALSO THIS IDEA THAT THAT THE ONLINE GAMING. IS NOT GOING TO COME TO CALIFORNIA I THINK. I THINK IT WILL BE COMING TO CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S TODAY OR OR A YEAR FROM NOW. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IT IS VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE. NOW HOW WE GO ABOUT CREATING A REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT THAT LOOKS AFTER THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE EXISTING STAKEHOLDERS- SOME OF WHICH HAD MAYBE INVESTED IN MAJOR CAPITAL EXPANSION INFRASTRUCTURES. WITH THE EXPECTATION OF REVENUES BEING ON A MORE EXCLUSIVE BASIS. WITH THAT BEING SAID I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM ANY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH TRIBES IN CARD ROOMS IN PONIES- I MYSELF REPRESENTING ALL OR PARTS OF ELEVEN COUNTIES HAVE HEARD FROM FOLKS IN THE PONIES- CARD ROOMS- FROM THE FAIR BOARDS AND FROM THE TRIBES AND I PRESENTED. THEM BUT I. ONLY IF THERE IS A PATH FORWARD. ENTER IN PRESUME LOSERS- WITH THE WAY IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PORCHES. OR ANY OTHER MY EX RAISED. SIR WIENER. THANK YOU SERVICE I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN DOG FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN GERMAN GRAY AS WELL- THESE ARE LONG FESTERING IN USE AND- TAKES LEADERSHIP AND BEING- WILLING TO HAVE THE SLINGS AND ARROWS COME OUT HERE TO TAKE ON AND TRY TO. ATTEMPT TO BROKER RESOLUTION ON SOME HARD IS. AND THIS ONE- IT ADDRESSES TO I I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON GAMBLING BUT I KNOW ENOUGH. TO KNOW THAT THE TRIED CARD ROOM BRAWL- AND THE ISSUE WITH SPORTS BETTING DISTURBANCES FLOATING AROUND FOR AWHILE AND ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED THIS IS A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO ADDRESS SOME. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY- I WON A SECOND ON COLLEAGUES SAY MAN AND I KNOW THE AUTHORS ARE COMMITTED TO THIS TO BRING THE PART TO BE ABLE. NOTHING THOSE ARE FEW GREATER IN CENTER TO COME THE- AFTER COMES OF COMMITTEE. IT BECOMES VERY REAL AT THAT POINT AND I'M CONFIDENT THE AUTHORS PARTY CHAIRMAN WILL. WILL BRING THE TRIBES CARTONS EVERYONE ELSE THE TABLE. TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH THIS OF COURSE WE NEED TO TWO THIRDS VOTE. ON THE FLOOR- I KNOW FROM FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE IT'S HARD. BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THESE AUTHORS SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR SENATOR GALGIANI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR- I HAVE CONCERNS OF WANTING TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND THE FINANCIAL WELL BEING OF OUR TRIBAL CASINOS THEIR BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES AND IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE HAVE ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WAGES THAT BIT PLATE HAVE BEEN PAID TO EMPLOYEES AND ONE. AND NOT. I TO VIEW AND ADDRESS TO THE STATE TO EMPLOY SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS AND CREATE JOBS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS I WANT TO ENSURE THE HEALTH OF THAT- MY QUESTION TO YOU IS I JUST WOULD LIKE YOU TO VERIFY FOR ME WITH TO THE ONLINE WAGERING AND THE ROLE OF THE TRIBES. I UNDERSTAND TO THIS BILL THAT THE SPORTS BETTING WOULD BE ALLOWED ON SITE. AND ONLINE BY THE TRIBES AND ALSO. WITH HORSE RACING. AND CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY FOR US AND THE PEOPLE BETWEEN THE TRIBES AND THEIR ONLINE AND THEY'RE ON SITE WAGERING AND THE HOW THAT LICENSING ARRANGEMENT WILL WORK. THE THANK YOU SENATOR- THROUGH THE CHAIR- YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT THEY WILL HAVE THE ABILITY DO ONLINE AND THEY'LL HAVE THE ABILITY TO- OBVIOUSLY DO BRICKS AND MORTARS IN FACT BECAUSE FURTHER IN THE IN THE TRIBAL INITIATIVE WHICH- YOU ONLY BUT FOR THE- CLOVER NINETEEN SITUATION WHAT A QUALIFIED IN THE OF MY ESTIMATION. THE OVER THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES- IN THERE ARE- INITIATIVE- THEY- YOUR GAVE THE RIGHTS TO HORSE RACING AND THEMSELVES FOR SPORTS BETTING AT BRICKS AND MORTAR WHAT WE DO IN OURS IS. SINCE SINCE ALL THE LINE IS 80% OF THE TOTAL BETTING MAYBE EVEN AS MUCH AS 85% WE HAVE TO INCLUDE. YOUR LIFE SO WE GAVE THE SAME BETTER THE FOR THE SAME TO THE TRIBES IN THE HORSE RACING WITH THE FOR THE TRIBES TO BE ABLE TO. LICENSE OTHER INTO THESE OUT AT. I BELIEVE THEIR DISCRETION CHAIRMAN DO YOU HAVE. I'LL JUST ADD TO THAT THAT. THAT'S ACCURATE 85290% OF SPORTS WAGERING REVENUE IN THE TWENTY TWO OTHER STATES TO DO THIS IS DERIVED FROM ONLINE. WHICH WAY DURING TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD HAVE THE OPTION YOU BOTH HAVE A BRICK AND MORTAR SPORTS BOOK- MUCH LIKE YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IF YOU'VE EVER TRAVELED TO CASINO IN LAS VEGAS- NEW JERSEY ROUSE WHERE AS WELL AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER THAT PRODUCT. ONLINE AS WELL SO HORSE RACING- LICENSE FOR TRICKS IT WOULD ALSO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER THAT ONLINE AND I MIGHT ADD IN A IN RESPONSE OF THE COMMENTS THAT. IF ANYONE'S GOING TO SUGGEST. THIS IS A BRAND NEW TOPIC. THAT THEY JUST READ ABOUT LAST NIGHT. THEY'VE EITHER BEEN ASLEEP. OR NOT DOING THEIR JOB HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE WE HAD A MULTI HOUR. JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE TOP TWO SPORTS WAGER WITH TONS OF LEGAL ANALYSIS FROM- FROM TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS FROM CARD CLUBS AND OTHER. STAKEHOLDERS IN THE INDUSTRY WE'VE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS LITERALLY MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE BOARD WE'VE DONE THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS READ A TOUGH POINT. IN THE ROAD RIGHT NOW WITH- FOLKS HAVING OPPOSING IDEAS AND POSITIONS AND HOPEFULLY AND I THINK SOME OF THE CENTERS FOR YOUR COMMENTS- WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THAT COMPROMISE BUT DOES THAT ANSWER QUESTIONS. YES IT DOES THANK YOU AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS RELATED TO HORSE RACING AND THE FAIRS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WE ALL KNOW OUR AFFAIRS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING FOR SOME TIME AND PARTICULARLY WITH THE CROWN OF VIRUS EPIDEMIC THAT WE'RE ALL AND NOW. SO MY QUESTION IS EVEN THOUGH IT'S VERY SPECIFIC IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THE SPORT WHICH ALLOWED REYES TRY ALAMY M. MÃ¡S ANGELES ORANGE OR SAN DIEGO COUNTIES. WELL IT CAN TAKE DISCUSSIONS. WHAT A HORSE USING INDUSTRY AND THE- TO ENSURE THAT THERE COULD BE A FOR SO BENEFIT THE FAIRS THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY LISTED HERE. AS AS THE CHAIRMAN- GRAVES IS SAID WERE WILLING TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH EVERYBODY I MIGHT POINT OUT. THAT FOR EVERY NEW LICENSE SEE THAT YOU HAVE. YOU ALSO HAVE THE PERHAPS OPPOSITION- FROM THE TO FROM THE TRIBE SO WE WANT TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO ADD OFTEN A CAUSE FURTHER ACHES SO IT'S GOING TO BE A DELICATE- DANCE. BUT WE DO HAVE SOME IDEAS OF HOW THAT POSSIBLY COULD WORK WE TALKED TO SOME OF THE FAIR REPRESENTATIVES I AM VERY REASONABLE AND EVERY CLASS. THIS DOWN IT SAYS IT WILL BE DOING LIKE YEAH. FROM MY TO THAT I KNOW YOU'RE FROM WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT I WORKED FOR SEVERAL YEARS RIGHT HERE AB FOURTEEN NINETY NINE YES I AM WHICH- TAKES A PORTION OF THE SALES TAX REVENUE SPENT AT FAIR GROUNDS AND GIVES IT BACK TO FAIR GROUNDS- FARES ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. AS YOU KNOW A GIRL. CULTURAL COMMUNITY. I THINK I AM WELL I KNOW I AM VERY CONCERNED. COM WE NEED TO RE ALIGN THE STATE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH FAIRS GOING FORWARD- AS A PART OF OUR BUDGET CUTS COMING UP HERE MEMBERS AND I THINK PART OF THIS DISCUSSION AROUND THIS ISSUE WHETHER IT'S CERTAIN FAIR FACILITIES HAVING BASINS SPORTS WAITER SODAS OR WHETHER IT'S SHIP FAIRS SHARING IN SOME REVENUE. DERIVED FROM THE ACTIVITY AT A LIKE IF YOU WERE- BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES LEOPARD OR TWO THOUSAND WHEN WE HAD- THE FAIR SHARE THE HORSE RACING REVENUE- AT ONE TIME AND THEN THAT WAS TAKEN OUT THE BAD BUDGET YEAR. RECESSION THERE IS THAT WHAT. HERE'S ONE WE'VE NOW SOME FIVE AND DO THE CO CRIES THE GOVERNOR'S LOOKING AND REALIZING THAT RELATIONSHIPS SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO BRING UP THE ISSUE I THINK THIS IS A KEY AVENUE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THAT SOMEONE RESPECT DOT COM WHICH IS YOU KNOW EVERY THIS IS ALL GIVEN TECH AND EVERYONE THAT. A LOT. TAKE FROM SOME ELSE AND THAT'S WE FOR THE TABLE AND YOUR DECISION TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY. GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY. SURE THAT EVEN THOSE THAT HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM THE TABLE CAN COME BACK. THANK YOU. CENTER BRAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH AUTHOR SENATOR DODD AND CHAIRMAN- GRAY FOR THIS MEASURE AS I HAVE LISTENED- THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE- AND BY. WE NOW HAVE NINE YEARS OF BEING HERE THIS IS A ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN A WIDELY DISCUSSED AND DEBATED MY PREDECESSOR SENATOR ROD RIGHT EVEN MADE A VALIANT EFFORT AT. MOVING THIS ISSUE FORWARD IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE MADE TO ISSUE THAT. AFTER STUDY LONG AYE AYE SIGNAL LOSERS HERE. I SEE WINNERS. WINNERS ON BOTH SIDES. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE ALLOWING IF THERE'S LIKE AN EXPANSION OF GAMING. THAT EXPANSION IS BEING AFFORDED OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS. CENTER BRADFORD HI CAN I ASK YOU TO PUT PUT ON YOUR MASK AND ALL OTHER MEMBERS TO PUT THEIR MASS ON I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU CARRYING ON BUSINESS AND I WAS IS THAT YOUR GET YOUR GET YOUR GOING TO GET ON A ROLL YEAH THIS IS NOT IDEAL I KNOW SPACE I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE APPRECIATE IT. BUT AGAIN IF THERE IS AN EXPANSION OF GAMING I THINK THAT EXPANSION HAS BEEN AFFORDED TO. OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS BY FORTY NAY ON THAT ADD ADDITIONAL NEW GAMES AS WELL AS SPORTS WAGERING WHAT IS CARD ROOMS GET GAME AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. THEY'RE BEING AFFORDED TO PLAY A GAME THAT THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR TWENTY YEARS. NOTHING NEW THEY'RE NOT EXPANDING ANYTHING THAT THEY HAVE HAVING ALREADY BEEN DOING. AND AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO GREW UP IN THE CITY OF GARDENA AS A CHILD WE HAD SIX CARD ROOMS WHEN HOUSING AT A GROWN UP IN GUARDIAN. WE PAID FULL SUPPORT NO TO ROBERT TAX. AND ADDITIONAL OTHER. OPERA AT THE CAR ROOMS PROVIDED OUTSIDE OF- TAX REVENUE FOR THE CITY AND- MAJOR EMPLOYMENT AS WELL TODAY GUARDINO HAS TWO CLUBS. TO AND- IT'S DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF NOT ONLY LAS VEGAS AS WELL AS OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE ARE NOW DOWN TO TWO. BUT WE HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SURVIVE I HAVE FOR COURT ROOMS IN MY DISTRICT. ONE IN THE CITY OF INGLEWOOD. AND ONE IN THE CITY OF CARSON. AND FOR ALL OF US WHO HAVE GONE THE LAS VEGAS I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD OF PRIMA DONNA. WELL BERNIE BROWN AGE PRIMA DONNA. HE STARTED IN GARDENA. THE GUARD THE CAR. SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES HE LEFT TO THE CONVENTION OPPORTUNITIES AND LAS VEGAS HE SET HIS OPERATION RIGHT THERE ON THE BORDER OF A CALIFORNIA NEVADA SO. AGAIN CAR ROOMS IF ANYONE HAS SUFFERED ITS I MEAN IF ANYONE HAS SUFFERED OVER THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS IT'S THE CARD ROOMS AND WE'VE HAD. MEMBERS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WHO HAVE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO STATED THE REASON THEY HAVE NOT RULED. ON IT IS BECAUSE IT'S A GRAY AREA DRESS BUT- PROP ONE EIGHTY DID NOT GIVE NATIVE AMERICANS EXCLUSIVITY. WHEN IT CAME TO CAR A GALE MEXICAN SEVENTY. WHEN IT CAME THE SLOT MACHINES AND THERE'S NOT A SINGLE CARD ROOM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WOULDN'T WANT A SLOT MACHINE IN THEIR FACILITY BUT NOT A SINGLE ONE IS LOOKING FOR THAT. NOT A SINGLE ONE IS ASKING FOR THAT ALL THEY'RE ASKING TO DO IS A FORTY ON THE OPPORTUNITY. THE CAN CONTINUE TO PLAY A GAME THAT THEY HAVE PLAYED. WHAT OUT. MUCH PROBLEMS OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WITHOUT MUCH. LEGAL ACTIVITY YOU HAVE ME DO WE CAN POINT TO LEGAL ACTIVITY IN ALMOST ANYTHING THAT WE DO FROM. LEGALIZE SPORTS TO WHATEVER THERE'S- AZ MRS GOALS ON BUT- I KNOW AGAIN I HAD SIX CAR ROOMS IN MY CITY I HAVE TO NOW NOT ONLY HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND CONTINENT INGLEWOOD NOT. ISSUES TWENTY LEGAL GAMES PEOPLE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. AND I SEE HERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO EXPAND THAT WHICH THEY ARE DOING THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE DONE QUITE WELL OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AGAIN AS A MEMBER GUARDINO CITY COUNCIL TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS ON THE BALLOT I STOOD OUT AS THE LONE MEMBERS CITY COUNCIL AND SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS FOR IT NATIVE AMERICAN COMPACTS I STILL WITH THE MAN. DESPITE THE PERSONS THAT I GOT FROM MY CAR OWNERS ARE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COUNCIL AND I STAND WITH- NOW BUT I ASKED US TO STAND IN UNITY SPACE IN LIGHT OF COLD IT. THE LIGHT OF THE RACISM THAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS STATE AND IN ITS MASON THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE ALVY SUBORDINATE TODAY. MISTER BRADFORD. CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I CERTAINLY JOIN IN- THE PRAISE OF THE AUTHORS OF THIS MEASURE A SENATOR GUIDED SELLING MEMBER GRAY I HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH SENATOR DOT FOR MANY YEARS HE'S A MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY LEADERSHIP AND TO TAKE ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS SPEAKS TO- THE EXPERTISE THAT HE HAS GAINED THE COURAGE THAT HE AND FOUR TO TWO THIRTY HAS WE KNOW HOW HARD AN ISSUE LIKE THIS IS AND IS DESERVING OF GREAT. PRAISE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. I HAVE HAD A VERY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP- WITH THE INDIAN COMMUNITY GOING BACK TWENTY TWO YEARS. AND THAT RELATIONSHIP HAS ALLOWED ME TO GET TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND. A LEADERSHIP IT'S THERE TODAY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE HISTORY THE HISTORY OF THE INDIANS. HERE IN OUR STATE. AND IT'S AN UGLY HISTORY. NOW I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE ISSUE BEFORE US TODAY BUT IT'S WORTH AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT UPON. THAT HISTORY AND IT COMES AT A TIME WHERE WE HAVE OUR OWN PANDEMIC BUT FOR THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY DISEASE BROUGHT IN FROM THE OUTSIDE WAS IS CERTAINLY A KILLER OF. THOUSANDS THEY HAD WARS THEY HAD MASSACRES MASSACRES BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LED BY LEADERS OF OUR STATE. PUT OUT BOUNTIES. BUT THE SCALLOPS OF INDIANS PART OF OUR UGLY HISTORY AS A STATE. AND THEN OF COURSE THEY WERE PUT ON RESERVATIONS. AND THEN NOT TOO FAR AFTER THAT THEY WERE KICKED OFF RESERVATIONS. AND FINALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY. THEY WERE TOLD TO REESTABLISH RESERVATIONS TO JUSTIFY RESERVATIONS AND WHERE DID THEY PUT THEM. THEY PUT THEM IN THE UNDESIRABLE PARTS OF OUR STATE. NEXT THE GARBAGE STOPS. FAR AWAY FROM CITIES ON LAND THAT WAS SO DESOLATE HE COULDN'T EVEN GROW CROPS THAT'S WHAT WE DID. THAT'S WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT DID. AND ALL THE RECEIPT WAS PALTRY HELP. FROM OUR FEDERAL LEADERS ANIMALS NOTHING FROM THE STATE AND SO WHAT HAPPENED. DOOR INDIAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS. MASSIVE POVERTY. MASSIVE UNEMPLOYMENT. NOW IN THE. END OF THE LAST CENTURY. NAY START ENTERPRISES ON THEIR LAND. GAMING ENTERPRISES OF COURSE WHAT HAPPENED. FEDERAL RAIDS FEDERAL PROSECUTION ACCUSATIONS THAT THEY WERE ACTING ILLEGALLY. TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING ON THEIR LAND AND THEY FACED ANOTHER. PERSECUTE FORM OF PERSECUTION. ATTACK THAT THEIR GAMES WERE LEGAL UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. TO WORK WITH THEM INTIMATELY ON THIS PROBLEM. AND WAS PLEASED TO JOIN WITH THEM IN PUTTING FORTH TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION FIVE TO LEGALIZE THOSE GAMES. BECAUSE OF THE LEGAL CHALLENGES AFTER THE PASSAGE THAT MEASURE. THEY HAD TO COME BACK TWO YEARS LATER FOR PROPOSITION ONE A THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SETTLED THIS DISPUTE FIND GAINES. WE THOUGHT. AND THAT SETTLEMENT ALLOWED THE TRIBES. TO BEGIN TO CREATE PROSPERITY FOR THEIR MEMBERS. NOT FOR ALL TRIBES FOR MANY TRIBES IN THE STATE OVER A HUNDRED MANY OF THEM DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF GAMING TO IMPROVE THEIR SITUATION. SO I HAVE THE SPECIAL APPRECIATION FOR THIS HISTORY AND I KNOW IT'S NOT BEFORE US BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT THAT IT BE SAID ON THIS FLOOR. THERE ARE TWO KEY ISSUES WHEN I LOOK AT LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE FACING TODAY. THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME. NUMBER ONE IT PROTECTS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE TRIBES THEIR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AS AT THE SAME AS CALIFORNIA THEY DESERVE TO BE DEALT WITH RESERVE WITH RESPECT. AND NOTHING THAT WE SHOULD DO SHOULD UNDERCUT. THAT ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY. AND THE SECOND STANDARD THAT I USE IN EVALUATING BILLS LIKE THIS TODAY IF THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY. WHAT PROP FIVE IN PROP ONE EIGHT DID WAS GIVE MANY OF THEM NOT ALL SOME LEVEL OF ECONOMIC SECURITY BY CREATING A FRANCHISE OF GAMING. BUT COULDN'T BE REPLICATED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE SO THEY COULD PROSPER. AND THEY HAVE PROSPERED. AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT LEGISLATION. THAT WE HAVE TODAY THOSE TWO OR THAT THE TWO STANDARDS THAT I EXAMINE CAREFULLY. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THIS BILL. I DON'T THINK IT PROTECTS THE FRANCHISE OF THE TRIBE. I THINK THAT IT ALLOWS FOR AN EXPANSION THAT CAN POTENTIALLY ROAD THE ECONOMIC SECURITY. OF THE TRIBES. AND THAT TROUBLES ME GREATLY. NOW IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CARD ROOMS OR THE RACE TRACKS I HAVE CARD ROOMS IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE A RACETRACK IN MY DISTRICT. I AM SENSITIVE TO THE IMPORTANT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT THOSE ENTERPRISES HAVE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I AM SENSITIVE TO THE JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED GOOD JOBS. AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BEFORE US. IN ITS CURRENT FORM. IT DOES NOT PROTECT THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF THE TRIBES. THE INTERNET THE EXPANSION OF GAMING ON THE INTERNET THROUGH SPORTS BETTING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO A ROAD THAT FRANCHISE. AND IT- AS I SAID TROUBLES ME I DO BELIEVE I THINK THE SENATOR FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY SAID IT'S EARLIER I DO BELIEVE THERE CAN BE A COMPROMISE HERE. THAT PROVIDES FOR SECURITY. THE CARD CLUBS IN THE RACETRACKS BUT DOES IN A ROW THE ECONOMIC SECURITY. OF THE TRIBES AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. AND I CERTAINLY. SHARE THE SENTIMENTS THAT FULL CONSULTATION. IS A REQUIREMENT. SO FOR ME THIS BILL DOESN'T STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE I STILL RESPECT THE AUTHOR I EXPECT RESPECT HIS LEADERSHIP I THINK HE CAN GET US TO A BETTER PLACE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL BEFORE US. IS NOT THAT PLACE. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER. I SEE NO OTHER MIKE'S UP SO. CALL CENTER ARCHULETA I'M SORRY. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER. I CONCUR WITH SENATOR BRADFORD I THINK YOUR PRESENTATION WAS OUTSTANDING GOING BACK TO YOUR YOUTH SEE IN SOMETHING. AS PROSPEROUS FOR THE COMMUNITY SHRINK DOWN THE TWO CASINOS IN OUR JUST THIRTY SECONDS SENATE DISTRICT WE HAVE THE CITY OF COMMERCE AND THEY HAVE THE CASINO THERE AND HAWAIIAN GARDENS THERE BECAUSE THEIR CASINO THERE AND- JUST ACROSS THE ROAD FROM MY THIRTY SECOND SENATE-DISTRICT. WE HAVE THE BICYCLE CLUB. THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THOSE THREE CASINOS PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES IT IS VITAL THAT THEY CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS. NOW BECAUSE THE CORONA VIRUS THEIR SHUT DOWN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE COMMERCE CASINO JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE TRYING TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN. TO CREATE A SEPARATE OPPORTUNITY SOME WAY SOMEHOW TO BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN. JUST NOW SO THEY'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO INTO WE OPEN THE DOORS FOR EVERYONE. THAT WE KNOW. BUT THIS BILL AND I THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. THAT THE TIME AND EFFORT TO DO AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER PUT TOGETHER. TO FIND AT THAT EQUAL I GUESS WE'LL CALL THIS THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. THE TRIBESMEN I'VE BEEN TO THE TO THE TRIBES I'VE SEEN WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES THERE SO I SEE THIS BILL IS A MUCH AS A COMPROMISE WERE GOING TO SEE. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE MULTITUDE OF YEARS THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE SENATE YOU'VE SEEN THE FIGHT. BUT NOW THE FIGHT IS OVER I THINK IT'S TIME TO UNITE. WITH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BILL. HOW THE CARD CLUBS ARE JUST GOING TO HANG IN THERE AND THAT'S ALL THEY'RE DOING IS. THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANYTHING THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL. WITH ADDING TO THEIR REVENUE IT IS NOTHING THIS ADDING TO THEIR TOLD ME TO THEIR OPERA. IT BE ABLE. EVERYTHING IN. IS GO TO HELP HI JIM THIS IS WHAT I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT. BECAUSE NOW WE CAN SEE THAT SOMEONE COULD CONTINUE TO WORK AND SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THEIR HORIZONS. AND BUILD THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED- AROUND THE THAT THE AREAS OF THE TRIBES. SO I I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT I THANK YOU SENATORDODD AND- ADAM GRAY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND EVERYONE HERE. THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS IS IT THIS IS HISTORY AND WE'RE SO PROUD I'M SO PROUD THAT WE'RE FACING THIS THE BEST WAY TO KEEP GOING IS THE PAST. THE BILL AND I THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA CENTER ALLEN YOU SURE. OKAY GREAT THING. CENTER PORTANTINO THANK YOU ARE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENED TODAY- I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION TODAY AND ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE TALKING BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE TALK TO EACH OTHER WE MAKE BETTER PUBLIC POLICY AND OBVIOUSLY THE NEXT STOP FOR THE BILL WILL BE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND I WELCOME THE CONTINUED COOPERATION OF THE TWO CHAIRS AND ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS IF IT GETS OFF THE FLOOR TODAY SO I LOOK FOR THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN PORTANTINO. SEEING NO OTHER MIKE SET UP CENTER GOD WOULD YOU CARE TO CLOSE I YES I WOULD FIRST I'D LIKE TO- SPEAK TO SENATOR GLAZERS COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL I AGREE WITH THE TWO STANDARDS THAT YOU SET FOR. I THINK THOSE ARE VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THAT GOES UP ON THIS BILL TODAY. WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT THAT THOSE TWO STANDARDS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD AND YOU'VE GOT MY COMMITMENT. TO WORK WITH YOU- ILL ON THAT IF THIS BILL- GETS OUT TODAY- AS I SAID IN MY OPENING COMMITMENT TO THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO IS TO NOT MOVE THIS BILL. ON THE FLOOR UNTIL WE'VE HAD THOSE SUBSTANTIVE. GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS. AIMS RESOLVE YOUR COMMENTS- SENATOR I WILL COMMIT TO INCLUDING YOU IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND I WILL NOT BRING THIS BILL ON THE FLOOR UNTIL YOU FEEL THE CONCERNS. HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK ALL OF YOU. ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMENTED ON BOTH SIDES PRO AND CON ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. BEFORE YOU KNOW JUST FOR BEING HERE PARTICIPATING SYSTEM BELIEVE ME WHEN WE HEAR THE COMMENTS FOR WE LEARN A LITTLE BIT. HERE THE COMING TOGETHER YEAH I GUESS WE LEARN OKAY A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND CERTAINLY IN THIS PROCESS- I'VE LEARNED A LOT AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S LOTS OF ROOM FOR MOVEMENT. A TO BRING THE PARTIES TOGETHER. THERE ARE SOME MANY ISSUES THAT STILL NEED TO BE WORKED OUT WE'VE HEARD THIS SONG ON THE FLOOR I BELIEVE THAT- THIS SCA REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE. FOR THE GAMING INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH MODIFICATIONS AND TAKING AND THOSE STANDARDS INTO ACCOUNT. IS IT OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN DID ALSO TO GERMAN GREAT YOU'RE THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE. THANK YOU- SENATORS FOR THE DIALOGUE AND THE ENGAGE DEBATE. ALL CONCUR WITH MY- SENATE COLLEAGUES COMMENTS. WE'RE BETTER OFF HAVING HAD THIS DISCUSSION. I PARTICULARLY WANT TO POINT OUT CENTER GLAZER. BOTH STANDARDS. AND ANSWERS THAT YOU REGISTER AND I THINK RAY SO TRIM IMPORTANT CONCEPTS. THE FULL CONSULTATION RESPECT. SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS. AND THE ISSUES ALTHOUGH THERE DIFFICULT AND WE'VE BEEN AT THEM FOR MANY YEARS I THINK WE'RE SO CLOSE TO MOVING FORWARD WITH SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR OUR TRIBAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT DRIVE BENEFIT. FROM THE ECONOMY'S RON ROOMS AND HORSE RACING. THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAIRS AND I THINK TODAY. WITH THE LEADERSHIP SHOWN BY CHAIRMAN DODD THE SENATE THIS COMMITTEE WE CAN RESET THOSE DISCUSSIONS IN A WAY THAT MADE WITH THE SPORT. AND I APPRECIATE THAT LEADERSHIP I THINK BEFORE I RESPECTFULLY DRIVE OUT. IF YOU TAKE AN EDITOR CLOSER YOU GONNA CLOSE THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL CITY.
