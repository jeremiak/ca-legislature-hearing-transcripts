EXTREMELY.

00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:54.146 region:rollup2

THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW

00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:12.364 region:rollup2
PATRIARCHY AND MISOGYNY

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:13.799 region:rollup2
INTERSECTS WITH RACISM AND CLASS

00:32:12.364 --> 00:32:15.901 region:rollup2
OF THOUGH PARTICULARLY WHEN IT

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:17.569 region:rollup2

AT FOLKS AND WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:23.408 region:rollup2
SAME VALUE FOR THAT.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.110 region:rollup2
FREIGHT WHAT IS IT MEAN WHEN

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:26.778 region:rollup2

00:32:30.182 --> 00:32:33.718 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN WE HAVE CONVERSATION

00:32:30.816 --> 00:32:35.520 region:rollup2
--

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:37.322 region:rollup2
RACISM THE CLASS OF THOUGH THEY

00:32:43.862 --> 00:32:47.866 region:rollup2
AND IF SHE WASN'T TAKEN

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:51.169 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY ISSUE WAS LEAKING --

00:32:47.866 --> 00:32:53.839 region:rollup2
LINKED LOOKED AT AS DIET YOU

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:55.073 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO IS NOT VALUED --

00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:56.741 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO IS THIS LAKE THOUGH

00:32:55.073 --> 00:32:57.876 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THOSE

MOVE.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.786 region:rollup2
RATE IN THIS OF THE THINGS THAT

00:33:05.884 --> 00:33:09.221 region:rollup2
--

00:33:07.786 --> 00:33:11.490 region:rollup2
IS NOT TALKED ABOUT A LOT WHEN

00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:13.325 region:rollup2
WE SPEAK ABOUT HOW DO WE ADDRESS

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:15.894 region:rollup2
RACISM AND CLASSISM AND

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:17.362 region:rollup2
PATRIARCHY AND OUR SPACE SAYS WE

00:33:15.894 --> 00:33:19.264 region:rollup2
ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW IN

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:20.699 region:rollup2
WHICH WE ARE REINFORCING THE

00:33:19.264 --> 00:33:23.602 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS --

00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:25.737 region:rollup2
WITH OUR YOUTH IN PARTICULAR WE

00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:27.539 region:rollup2
HAD -- THERE

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:29.708 region:rollup2
IS A STUDY THAT CAME OUT.

00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:32.677 region:rollup2
I'M NOT TOO LONG AGO THAT WAS

00:33:29.708 --> 00:33:33.778 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WOMEN --

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:35.213 region:rollup2
IS MEET YOUNG FOLKS.

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:36.615 region:rollup2
AND ACCESS.

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:37.716 region:rollup2
TO PARTICULARLY BLACK GIRLS WHAT

00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:39.718 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK SOCIETY THINKS

00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:41.152 region:rollup2
ABOUT CHAU.

00:33:39.718 --> 00:33:42.554 region:rollup2
AND THEY SAID THAT THEY THOUGHT

00:33:41.152 --> 00:33:43.855 region:rollup2
THE SOCIETIES THAT ARE MOST

00:33:42.554 --> 00:33:45.323 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT APPEAL WITH THEIR SEX

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:46.558 region:rollup2
APPEAL.

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:49.528 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THESE ARE HIGH SCHOOL

00:33:46.558 --> 00:33:51.263 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND SO WE ARE TALLIED

00:33:49.528 --> 00:33:53.098 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE ARE

00:33:51.263 --> 00:33:54.599 region:rollup2
SHOWING IN OUR CULTURE AT THAT

00:33:53.098 --> 00:33:56.301 region:rollup2
THEIR MOST IMPORTANT.

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:57.936 region:rollup2
THING IS THEIR SEX APPEAL OF

00:33:56.301 --> 00:33:59.170 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE INTO THEIR AND

00:33:57.936 --> 00:34:02.474 region:rollup2
THE RELATIONSHIP.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.808 region:rollup2
RATE THAN THEIR VALUES OF WAY OF

00:34:02.474 --> 00:34:05.410 region:rollup2
THEIR RELIEF THAT THEY VALUE THE

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:07.312 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP SOMETIMES MORE THAN

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:09.614 region:rollup2
THEY VALUE THEMSELVES AND THAT

00:34:07.312 --> 00:34:10.615 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ALSO REINFORCES THE

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:11.716 region:rollup2
CARGO --

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:13.785 region:rollup2
REINFORCE THE SPACE AND

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:14.986 region:rollup2
REINFORCES THE ENVIRONMENT IN

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:16.588 region:rollup2
WHICH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COULD

00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:18.456 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN BECAUSE WE ARE.

00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:21.059 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY SOCIETY SAID YOU'RE

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:24.362 region:rollup2
NOT WORTHY OF BEING [inaudible]

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:27.499 region:rollup2
SAFE AND SO I AM NOT SURE WINNER

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:29.367 region:rollup2
CLOSE AS TO THE MEASURE FAIRLY

00:34:27.499 --> 00:34:31.036 region:rollup2
SEPARATES BUT TALKED ABOUT --

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:33.104 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE OF SPOTS.

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:34.406 region:rollup2
A LIST THAT HE LOOKING AT DV

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:36.741 region:rollup2

MORE LIKELY TO BE MURDERED BY A

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:53.925 region:rollup2
SPOUSE THEN MAN.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:55.527 region:rollup2

pLISTENING TO TO THE DISCUSSION

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:30.321 region:rollup2

WE CAN GET AN ANSWER TO THAT IS

00:36:39.097 --> 00:36:42.967 region:rollup2
--

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:44.502 region:rollup2
SHE WENT TO COURT FOR A

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.637 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER.

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:47.072 region:rollup2
AND WHICH IS COMPLETELY

00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:48.606 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN ACTUALLY CHARGING

00:36:47.072 --> 00:36:48.840 region:rollup2
HIM WITH ANY CRIME.

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:51.876 region:rollup2

BORROW MONEY FROM MY PARENTS

00:37:00.118 --> 00:37:03.988 region:rollup2
EXOTIC FEDERAL.

00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:05.790 region:rollup2
AND I WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:08.226 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER WE WERE NOT

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:09.994 region:rollup2
ABLE TO AFFORD ANOTHER ATTORNEY

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:11.396 region:rollup2
TO TRY AND CHARGE HIM.

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:13.731 region:rollup2
WITH THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE AND

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:15.467 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE I DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:17.035 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

00:37:15.467 --> 00:37:18.603 region:rollup2
AND I NEED YOUR HELP IF THERE IS

00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:21.506 region:rollup2
ANYTHING LEGISLATIVELY THAT WE

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:22.440 region:rollup2
CAN DO TO CORRECT THAT BECAUSE

00:37:21.506 --> 00:37:24.876 region:rollup2
AWAIT HER ATTORNEY SAID.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.410 region:rollup2

ORDER.

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:30.381 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO PRESS

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:32.817 region:rollup2
CHARGES YOU HAVE TO GO TO COURT

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:34.819 region:rollup2
AGAIN IMPROVE IT NOT ONLY PROVE

00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:36.988 region:rollup2

MONEY ON AN ATTORNEY. TO DO THIS

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:39.557 region:rollup2

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:41.619 region:rollup2
--

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:41.920 region:rollup2
WE HEAR THAT HE'S ATTENDING

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:44.155 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.423 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:47.892 region:rollup2
I AM NOT PART OF THE THE

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:49.694 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER --

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:51.329 region:rollup2
ONLY SHE AS AND SO.

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:52.664 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT WHOLE DYNAMIC AND

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:55.133 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE

00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:57.335 region:rollup2
HAVE RESOURCES I HAVE ACCESS TO

00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:59.204 region:rollup2
RESOURCES INTO INFORMATION AND

00:38:57.335 --> 00:39:00.538 region:rollup2
SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW

00:38:59.204 --> 00:39:01.806 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT IT IS.

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:04.142 region:rollup2
NOT A FOR ITS DIFFICULT ENOUGH

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:05.310 region:rollup2
FOR IT FOR ACTS BUT FOR SOMEBODY

00:39:04.142 --> 00:39:06.978 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.179 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE

00:39:06.978 --> 00:39:10.248 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE ACCESS TO OUR

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:12.283 region:rollup2
PARENTS THAT CAN PROVERBIAL HELP

00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:14.953 region:rollup2
WITH A LITTLE BIT --

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:17.121 region:rollup2
I WANT US TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS

00:39:14.953 --> 00:39:18.189 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE CAN

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:20.191 region:rollup2
DO LEGISLATIVELY AND IN ON

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:21.292 region:rollup2
THROWING IT OUT THERE. TO CLOSE

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:22.894 region:rollup2
ITS WHICH SEEMS TO ME LIKE A

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:25.597 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLE.

00:39:22.894 --> 00:39:26.965 region:rollup2
OF DOT NOW AFTER SHE READ

00:39:25.597 --> 00:39:28.499 region:rollup2
OBTAINED A RESTRAINING ORDER NOW

00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:30.535 region:rollup2
SHE HAS TO GO BACK.

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:32.303 region:rollup2
AND TRY TO CHARGE HIM AND SO HIS

00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:33.404 region:rollup2
NARRATIVE NOW AS WELL.

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:34.872 region:rollup2
IF I WAS THAT GUILTY WHY HAVEN'T

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:36.407 region:rollup2
I BEEN CHARGED.

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:39.677 region:rollup2
AND SO HE'S CONVINCING OTHER

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:41.045 region:rollup2
FOLKS GULLIBLE FOLKS THAT --

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:42.580 region:rollup2
HE DIDN'T DO IT THAT IT WAS A

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:44.015 region:rollup2
MISTAKE THAT THE JUDGE GAVE THE

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.717 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER AND YOU'D BE

00:39:44.015 --> 00:39:47.852 region:rollup2
SURPRISED.

00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:48.953 region:rollup2
IN OUR POLITICAL WORLD.

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:50.421 region:rollup2
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF NOT

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:52.123 region:rollup2
JUST MALES A WHOLE BUNCH OF

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:54.292 region:rollup2
FEMALES INCLUDING SOME MEMBERS

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:56.728 region:rollup2
OF MY OWN --

00:39:54.292 --> 00:39:58.129 region:rollup2
CAUCUS THAT ACTUALLY BELIEVE HIM

00:39:56.728 --> 00:40:00.298 region:rollup2
THEY BELIEVE THAT HE DIDN'T DO

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:02.634 region:rollup2
ANYTHING AND SO.

00:40:00.298 --> 00:40:05.937 region:rollup2
HELP ME AGAIN WE CANNOT DO THIS

00:40:02.634 --> 00:40:06.571 region:rollup2
TODAY OBVIOUSLY BUT I EXPECTS

00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:07.805 region:rollup2
AND I WILL.

00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:09.641 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT I'M HERE FOR

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:11.542 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TEN YEARS AND SOUL IF

00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:13.845 region:rollup2
YOU ALL CAN HELP ME FIGURE OUT

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:14.879 region:rollup2
HOW TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE.

00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:16.814 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S UNFAIR IT'S UNJUST

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:19.183 region:rollup2
AND LIKE I SAID NOT JUST TO TALK

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:21.085 region:rollup2
TO OZ BY TWO WOMEN.

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:22.854 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:24.389 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE ACCESS

00:40:22.854 --> 00:40:27.458 region:rollup2
TO RESOURCES IT'S HAPPENING.

00:40:24.389 --> 00:40:29.260 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I ALSO

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:30.795 region:rollup2
WANT TO ADDRESSES.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.531 region:rollup2
SO WE WENT ACCORDING UP THE

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:35.500 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER AND THEN WENT.

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:36.834 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHAT BECAUSE WE THINK

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.303 region:rollup2

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:39.337 region:rollup2

RESTRAINING ORDER AND WE'RE IN

00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:43.308 region:rollup2
THE SECOND YEAR SO WHAT HAPPENS

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.810 region:rollup2
ON THAT THIRD YEAR.

00:40:43.308 --> 00:40:47.712 region:rollup2
AND IF HE'S.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.580 region:rollup2
FIGURING OUT WAYS TO STILL

00:40:47.712 --> 00:40:51.182 region:rollup2
ABUSER BECAUSE IT'S STILL ABUSE

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.750 region:rollup2
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT HE

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:55.486 region:rollup2
THINKS IT'S JUST OPOKU ITS

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:57.155 region:rollup2
POLITICAL NO IT'S ABUSE DEL HOW.

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:58.890 region:rollup2
THEN WHAT HAPPENS AND I THINK WE

00:40:57.155 --> 00:41:00.425 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.893 region:rollup2
I AND I AM SURE THIS WILL BE A

00:41:00.425 --> 00:41:02.994 region:rollup2
TOPIC OF LONG CONVERSATION BUT

00:41:01.893 --> 00:41:04.562 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT WHAT

00:41:02.994 --> 00:41:07.131 region:rollup2
HAPPENS AFTER.

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:08.433 region:rollup2
SO A FEMALE --

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:10.535 region:rollup2

STRUGGLING FOR A VERY LONG TIME

00:41:12.904 --> 00:41:18.009 region:rollup2

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:19.610 region:rollup2
TERRY CREWS AYE THE ACTOR AND HE

00:41:18.009 --> 00:41:20.845 region:rollup2
PUT OUT A VIDEO AND IF HE'S

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:22.280 region:rollup2
LISTENING HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:24.248 region:rollup2
IT HAS TAG HIM.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.850 region:rollup2
ON THIS BECAUSE I DID YOU HEAR

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:27.118 region:rollup2
WHAT HE SAID WHAT HE SAID WAS

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.653 region:rollup2
THAT HIS MOTHER.

00:41:27.118 --> 00:41:30.588 region:rollup2
WAS ALWAYS READY TO LEAVE THAT

00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:31.789 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP AND SHE WAS LIKE

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:32.423 region:rollup2
PACKING THEIR BAGS AND IT'S LIKE

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:33.358 region:rollup2
OKAY KIDS LET'S GO AND THEN SHE

00:41:32.423 --> 00:41:35.560 region:rollup2

BUT WE'VE GOT NOWHERE TO GO.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.029 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT NO MONEY TO GO FIND A

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:39.330 region:rollup2
PLACE AND THEN THEY WOULD STAY

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:41.332 region:rollup2
IN THAT RELATIONSHIP AND SO IT'S

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:43.034 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT IS THE PERCEPTION

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:43.634 region:rollup2
THAT THESE WOMEN STAY.

00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:46.237 region:rollup2

TERRY CRUISES CASE HE SAID THAT.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.559 region:rollup2

00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:26.170 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN OUT OF MY DOMESTIC

00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:30.341 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE SITUATION FOR A WHILE

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:32.543 region:rollup2
NOW AND THERE WAS A LOT OF

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:35.546 region:rollup2
BARRIERS THAT I WAS FACED WITH

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:36.747 region:rollup2
WITH BEYOND A SINGLE MOTHER OF

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:37.982 region:rollup2

FAMILY.

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:44.789 region:rollup2
SO I DID END UP IN AN ABUSIVE

00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:46.624 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP THAT --

00:43:44.789 --> 00:43:49.594 region:rollup2
WAS VERY HARD --

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:51.162 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:43:49.594 --> 00:43:52.763 region:rollup2
FACED WAS TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE

00:43:51.162 --> 00:43:55.500 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:57.668 region:rollup2
IT WAS EXTREMELY HARD THAT WAS

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.769 region:rollup2
HARD FOR ME TO GET HOUSING --%

00:43:57.668 --> 00:44:01.105 region:rollup2
THE HOUSING THAT I HAD IT WASN'T

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:04.175 region:rollup2
SAFE -- AND

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:04.709 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY THAT IT DIDN'T PROTECT

00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:05.676 region:rollup2
ME FROM THE ABUSER BECAUSE

00:44:04.709 --> 00:44:07.044 region:rollup2
LET'S.

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:08.713 region:rollup2

00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:13.818 region:rollup2
DIDN'T STOP HIM.

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:15.119 region:rollup2
HE STILL CAME AND HARASSED ME BY

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:16.521 region:rollup2
IN ORDER FOR HIM TO BE RE

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:18.623 region:rollup2
ARRESTED.

00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:20.858 region:rollup2
HE WOULD HAVE TO BE CAUGHT OWN

00:44:18.623 --> 00:44:24.462 region:rollup2
THING BASICALLY SO --

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:24.462 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THE CAT AND MOUSE GAME

00:44:24.529 --> 00:44:29.667 region:rollup2
ME OR MY CHILDREN --

00:44:27.265 --> 00:44:30.568 region:rollup2
AND SO BEGAN THAT I'D NOW WORK

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:32.803 region:rollup2
WITH VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:33.771 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE.

00:44:32.803 --> 00:44:34.705 region:rollup2
SEXUAL THOUGHT AND HUMAN

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:37.141 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING [inaudible]

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:40.478 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO.

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:42.647 region:rollup2
SO MANY LAYERS AND BARRIERS THAT

00:44:40.478 --> 00:44:43.214 region:rollup2
I SEE THAT JUST REALLY CONFIRMS

00:44:42.647 --> 00:44:46.184 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A REAL

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:47.552 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:44:46.184 --> 00:44:48.886 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT ONE OF THE

00:44:47.552 --> 00:44:50.755 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT I'D LIKE TO

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:53.024 region:rollup2
ADDRESS IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

00:44:50.755 --> 00:44:54.892 region:rollup2
MONEY FOR SAFETY.

00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:56.761 region:rollup2
OUR SAFE HOUSES DON'T HAVE

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:59.397 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MONEY.

00:44:56.761 --> 00:45:01.165 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM IS INCREASING AND

00:44:59.397 --> 00:45:04.101 region:rollup2
CLIENTS ARE HAPPEN TO BE TURNED

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:06.237 region:rollup2
AWAY BECAUSE THIS SHELTERS FULL

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:07.805 region:rollup2
OR THAT SHELTERS FOOL AND THEN

00:45:06.237 --> 00:45:09.740 region:rollup2
THE MONEY THAT WE DO GET.

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:11.375 region:rollup2
IT'S RESTRICTED.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.344 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:15.513 region:rollup2
NEED IS WE NEED UNRESTRICTED

00:45:13.344 --> 00:45:17.882 region:rollup2
FUNDS EVER WANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:45:15.513 --> 00:45:19.150 region:rollup2
SAVE LIVES NOT ONLY DO WE NEED

00:45:17.882 --> 00:45:20.518 region:rollup2
AND RESTRICT THE FANS BUT WE

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.752 region:rollup2
NEED SERVICES.

00:45:20.518 --> 00:45:22.653 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO TAP

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:25.289 region:rollup2
INTO [inaudible]

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:26.591 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH.

00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:28.226 region:rollup2
A LOT OF ARE SURVIVORS END UP

00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:29.760 region:rollup2
HOMELESS.

00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:31.395 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT MENTAL MENTALLY

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.665 region:rollup2
UNSTABLE BECAUSE OF THE DOMESTIC

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:36.334 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE SO YOU HAVE YOU KNOW.

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:39.270 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA THEN YOU

00:45:36.334 --> 00:45:41.739 region:rollup2
HAVE HOUSING IS WAY TOO HIGH AND

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.741 region:rollup2
THEN YOU KNOW THAT THAT HUMAN

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:45.409 region:rollup2
RESOURCE OR HUMAN SERVICES.

00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:47.211 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE.

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:48.879 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS ENOUGH TIME TO GET ON

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:50.414 region:rollup2
THEIR FEET BEFORE THE ALREADY

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:52.416 region:rollup2
PULLED THE RUG FROM UP UNDER OWN

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:55.319 region:rollup2
NOT PROVIDING CHILDCARE.

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:56.787 region:rollup2
NOT PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION --

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:58.589 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE THAT

00:45:56.787 --> 00:45:59.724 region:rollup2
ONLY MAKING FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:01.292 region:rollup2
SIXTY DOLLARS A MONTH WITH THREE

00:45:59.724 --> 00:46:02.293 region:rollup2
KIDS THAT HAVE TO PAY TWELVE

00:46:01.292 --> 00:46:03.294 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS IN RENT THAT

00:46:02.293 --> 00:46:04.195 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO SURVIVE THEY NEED

00:46:03.294 --> 00:46:06.264 region:rollup2
TO SURVIVE ON THAT [inaudible]

00:46:04.195 --> 00:46:08.032 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:11.035 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED MORE FUNDING IN THAT

00:46:08.032 --> 00:46:12.503 region:rollup2
AREA WE NEED MORE FUNDING FOR

00:46:11.035 --> 00:46:15.473 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH WE NEED --

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:17.575 region:rollup2
ABUSERS WE NEED FUNDING FOR THEM

00:46:15.473 --> 00:46:19.910 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY CAN.

00:46:17.575 --> 00:46:21.078 region:rollup2
GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:23.047 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A

00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:24.415 region:rollup2
LEARNED BEHAVIOR.

00:46:23.047 --> 00:46:26.017 region:rollup2
SO WHAT OF WHAT AT WHAT IS THE

00:46:24.415 --> 00:46:27.718 region:rollup2
ROOT OF THE ISSUE WHAT IS THE

00:46:26.017 --> 00:46:29.620 region:rollup2
ROOT OF THEIR ABUSE THAT CAUSES

00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:32.456 region:rollup2
THEM TO IT TO HARM PEOPLE.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.925 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A LOT OF I THINK THAT

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:36.027 region:rollup2
THAT WE JUST.

00:46:34.925 --> 00:46:37.995 region:rollup2

00:46:36.027 --> 00:46:40.398 region:rollup2
LANDLORD DISCRIMINATION.

00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:43.000 region:rollup2
AND HOUSING PROGRAM THAT I RENT.

00:46:40.398 --> 00:46:46.103 region:rollup2
I HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME GETTING

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.471 region:rollup2
CLIENTS HAL'S BECAUSE LANDLORDS

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:49.907 region:rollup2
WANT TO DISCRIMINATE WHAT WE

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:53.144 region:rollup2
DON'T YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:54.912 region:rollup2
THAT PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY OR

00:46:53.144 --> 00:46:56.714 region:rollup2
THEY REYES THAT --

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:58.616 region:rollup2
DEPOSITS TWO ONE THREE TIMES TO

00:46:56.714 --> 00:47:00.117 region:rollup2
READ BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT

00:46:58.616 --> 00:47:01.285 region:rollup2
THERE IS A PROGRAM THAT'S GOING

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:02.887 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR IT.

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:05.489 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN THE PROGRAM

00:47:02.887 --> 00:47:07.091 region:rollup2
ENDS OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:08.526 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING AND THEN.

00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:10.828 region:rollup2
THEY END UP BACK IN THE SAME

00:47:08.526 --> 00:47:12.596 region:rollup2
CYCLE THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED.

00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:15.900 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP ALL

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:18.102 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE JUST WANT TO SURVIVE.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.804 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:47:18.102 --> 00:47:22.940 region:rollup2
TAKE TO GET AHEAD WE WANT TO BE

00:47:19.804 --> 00:47:24.108 region:rollup2
ABLE. TO TO BREAK THAT TO BREAK

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.343 region:rollup2

SURVIVORS.

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:31.082 region:rollup2

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:32.583 region:rollup2
NEXT GENERATION OUR OWN KIDS.

00:47:31.082 --> 00:47:34.418 region:rollup2

I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.511 region:rollup2
THE NATIVE COMMUNITY THAT I

00:48:32.977 --> 00:48:36.280 region:rollup2
SUPPORT PARENTS SACRAMENTO

00:48:33.511 --> 00:48:37.882 region:rollup2
COUNTY --

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.350 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR

00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:41.819 region:rollup2
SHARING THE STORY ABOUT YOUR

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:44.054 region:rollup2
FAMILY -- IN

00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:45.823 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND WHEN THE SAFE FOR

00:48:44.054 --> 00:48:47.491 region:rollup2
SIX IN SUMMER DINO COUNTY MY

00:48:45.823 --> 00:48:49.460 region:rollup2
COUSIN WAS --

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:50.594 region:rollup2
A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.163 region:rollup2
SHE ALSO FILED A RESTRAINING

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:52.997 region:rollup2
ORDER AND IT WAS A REALLY LONG

00:48:52.163 --> 00:48:53.697 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR THAT RESTRAINING

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:55.199 region:rollup2
ORDER.

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:58.302 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY SHE WAS KILLED BY

00:48:55.199 --> 00:48:59.804 region:rollup2
HER EX HUSBAND AND SO --

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:00.471 region:rollup2
THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WHY

00:48:59.804 --> 00:49:01.439 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT I DO THE WORK THAT I

00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:03.674 region:rollup2
DO.

00:49:01.439 --> 00:49:05.843 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO MY OWN HISTORY --

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:07.311 region:rollup2
OUR PEOPLE ARE --

00:49:05.843 --> 00:49:09.079 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS OF INTERGENERATIONAL

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:10.614 region:rollup2
TRAUMA AND SO I THINK THAT

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:12.349 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE IT ALL BEGINS FOR

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:14.418 region:rollup2
US -- FOR A

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:16.153 region:rollup2
LOT OF US WE ARE DOMESTIC

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:17.555 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE IS VERY NORMALIZED.

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:19.590 region:rollup2
IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN OUR

00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:21.192 region:rollup2
HOMES AND WERE RAISED TO BELIEVE

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.560 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S JUST FIGHTING YOU KNOW

00:49:21.192 --> 00:49:24.028 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.563 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY GETS KILLED AND IT'S

00:49:24.028 --> 00:49:27.731 region:rollup2
REALLY NOT THAT SIMPLE.

00:49:25.563 --> 00:49:29.033 region:rollup2
AND SO --

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:30.835 region:rollup2
FOR ME I DON'T BELIEVE

00:49:29.033 --> 00:49:32.870 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THAT IT'S COMPLETELY

00:49:30.835 --> 00:49:35.272 region:rollup2
A POVERTY ISSUE I BELIEVE THAT

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:37.208 region:rollup2
IT IS A A FACTOR OF OPPRESSION.

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:38.342 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES

00:49:37.208 --> 00:49:39.677 region:rollup2
THAT WE SUPPORT THAT ARE

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:41.412 region:rollup2
OPPRESSED IN THIS IS A COMMON

00:49:39.677 --> 00:49:42.446 region:rollup2
DENOMINATOR IN ALL OF THEM.

00:49:41.412 --> 00:49:44.114 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:45.616 region:rollup2
ARE AT THE POVERTY LEVEL THAT

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:46.951 region:rollup2
ARE VERY HEALTHY YOU KNOW

00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:49.887 region:rollup2
THEY'RE JUST ARE STRUGGLING

00:49:46.951 --> 00:49:51.388 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY --

00:49:49.887 --> 00:49:53.290 region:rollup2
FOR A GOOD NATIVE COMMUNITY AS

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:54.625 region:rollup2
FAR AS THE WOMEN AND THE

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:57.394 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED A HUGE

00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:59.763 region:rollup2
BARRIER FOR US IS THAT WE DON'T

00:49:57.394 --> 00:50:01.932 region:rollup2
REPORT PORTS UNDER REPORTED DUE

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:03.901 region:rollup2
TO AGAIN HISTORICAL TRAUMA --

00:50:01.932 --> 00:50:05.035 region:rollup2
FROM THE BOARDING SCHOOL ERAS

00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:06.937 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN WERE REMOVED FROM

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:09.373 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND IN THAT PROCESS A

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:11.075 region:rollup2
LOT OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:13.010 region:rollup2
SEXUALLY MOLESTED --

00:50:11.075 --> 00:50:14.144 region:rollup2
CAME OUT BEING YOU KNOW ABUSERS

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:18.148 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:21.485 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THE DRUG.

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:23.153 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS AND ALCOHOLISM BEGAN TO

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:26.323 region:rollup2
LIKE INVEST OUR OUR PEOPLE AND

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:28.359 region:rollup2
SO OF THE DOTS A HUGE PART OF

00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:30.261 region:rollup2
THE BARRIER AS TO WHY IT'S ALSO

00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:31.495 region:rollup2
UNDER REPORTED I BELIEVE --

00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:32.563 region:rollup2
CASE IN POINT RIGHT NOW WHAT'S

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:34.565 region:rollup2
HAPPENING AT THE BORDER THE

00:50:32.563 --> 00:50:36.233 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE BEING REMOVED AND

00:50:34.565 --> 00:50:37.768 region:rollup2
THOSE CHILDREN ARE BASICALLY AT

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:39.470 region:rollup2
SOME POINT PROBABLY GOING TO BE

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:41.839 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WE SUPPORT YOU KNOW

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.439 region:rollup2
AND IT ALL IT'S DOING IS CAUSING

00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:43.707 region:rollup2
INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA AND

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:46.343 region:rollup2
MORE TRAUMA --

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:49.380 region:rollup2
WE SEE I SUPPORT WOMEN AND YOUNG

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:50.614 region:rollup2
GIRLS THAT SCORE A TEN ON THE A

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.649 region:rollup2
SCREENING.

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.783 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE

00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:54.118 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT THAT IS

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:55.319 region:rollup2
BASICALLY A FACTOR THAT'S

00:50:54.118 --> 00:50:58.656 region:rollup2
PROVING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:50:55.319 --> 00:51:00.090 region:rollup2
HAVE MAJOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND

00:50:58.656 --> 00:51:01.959 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS AT WHEN THEY GROW UP.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:03.794 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THEIR CHILDREN

00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:05.563 region:rollup2
AND SO -- AS%

00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:07.898 region:rollup2
FAR AS HOUSING IS CONCERNED --

00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:09.433 region:rollup2
WE WORK WITH THE POPULATION THAT

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:11.735 region:rollup2
THEIR ABUSERS WILL LITERALLY

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:13.037 region:rollup2
BURN THEIR IDENTITY AND THEY

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:15.139 region:rollup2
TAKE FROM THEM AND IT IS

00:51:13.037 --> 00:51:16.740 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ACTIONS IT'S

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:18.475 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE IS A VERY VERY IT'S

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.643 region:rollup2
LIKE HARD TO GET IT BACK.

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:20.678 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE CRISIS YOU'RE NOT

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:23.747 region:rollup2
THINKING?

00:51:20.678 --> 00:51:25.716 region:rollup2
I NEED MY ID SO I CAN GO GET A

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:27.618 region:rollup2
HOTEL YOU'RE JUST THINKING HOW

00:51:25.716 --> 00:51:29.753 region:rollup2
MY GOING TO BE SAFE COMING IN TO

00:51:27.618 --> 00:51:32.289 region:rollup2
GET TO THIS NEXT UP --

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:32.790 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF BARRIERS AS

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:34.425 region:rollup2
FAR AS THE LANDLORDS ARE

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:37.361 region:rollup2
CONCERNED.

00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:39.229 region:rollup2
THEY THEY DO DISCRIMINATE BASED

00:51:37.361 --> 00:51:40.731 region:rollup2
ON THEM TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR

00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:43.767 region:rollup2
OWN PROPERTIES IN THEIR OWN YOU

00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:46.403 region:rollup2
KNOW -- I

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:48.072 region:rollup2
GUESS RESOURCES AND THEY DON'T

00:51:46.403 --> 00:51:49.707 region:rollup2
WANT THE SAME CYCLE TO BE

00:51:48.072 --> 00:51:50.307 region:rollup2
REPEATED AND THEY CERTAINLY

00:51:49.707 --> 00:51:51.241 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

00:51:50.307 --> 00:51:53.277 region:rollup2
CALM.

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:54.511 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW CAUSE A RUCKUS

00:51:53.277 --> 00:51:56.046 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN SOME OF THE CASES

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:58.248 region:rollup2
THAT'S AND THAT ENDS UP WHAT'S

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:59.950 region:rollup2
HAPPENING --

00:51:58.248 --> 00:52:02.052 region:rollup2
WE'RE SAYING THAT DB IS ONE OF

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:04.688 region:rollup2
THE MAIN CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS.

00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:06.390 region:rollup2
A IN URBAN AREAS STEEPLY CPS IS

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:07.791 region:rollup2
OFTEN CALLED AND THAT THE AGAIN

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:08.993 region:rollup2
THE FEAR OF REMOVING OUR

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:11.495 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IS A BIG IT'S A BIG

00:52:08.993 --> 00:52:12.496 region:rollup2
BARRIER IF NOT THE NUMBER

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:14.164 region:rollup2
ONE THE LACK OF CULTURAL

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:15.466 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE HERE IN

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:16.934 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO FOR THE NATIVE

00:52:15.466 --> 00:52:18.102 region:rollup2
POPULATION --

00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:20.437 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A

00:52:18.102 --> 00:52:22.339 region:rollup2
TRUST ISSUE AND AGAIN THAT GOES

00:52:20.437 --> 00:52:24.742 region:rollup2
BACK TO HISTORICAL TRAUMA.

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:27.277 region:rollup2
WE LOSE JOBS.

00:52:24.742 --> 00:52:30.247 region:rollup2
DUE TO LACK OF SICK TIME A LOT

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:30.714 region:rollup2
OF OUR PEOPLE DON'T HAVE.

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:31.548 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT IT OF FORMAL

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:33.651 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:35.085 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:37.187 region:rollup2
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RESTRAINING

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:38.722 region:rollup2
ORDER PROCESS IT'S AN ENTIRE DAY

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:40.624 region:rollup2
IF IT GETS APPROVED IF YOU DO IT

00:52:38.722 --> 00:52:41.759 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE TO COME

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:43.594 region:rollup2
BACK AND CONTINUALLY PRESSED

00:52:41.759 --> 00:52:44.495 region:rollup2
CHARGES IN ADDITION TO FIGURING

00:52:43.594 --> 00:52:44.962 region:rollup2
OUT WHERE YOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO

00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:46.597 region:rollup2
GO.

00:52:44.962 --> 00:52:47.664 region:rollup2
GOING BACK AND PICKING THEM UP

00:52:46.597 --> 00:52:49.433 region:rollup2
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:51.135 region:rollup2
REGULAR OPERATIONAL THINGS FOR

00:52:49.433 --> 00:52:53.237 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LIKE US BUT SOMEBODY IN

00:52:51.135 --> 00:52:54.405 region:rollup2
CRISIS HAS A REALLY REALLY HARD

00:52:53.237 --> 00:52:59.209 region:rollup2
TIME PUTTING ALL THE PIECES

00:52:54.405 --> 00:53:00.344 region:rollup2
TOGETHER --

00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:02.279 region:rollup2
A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES ARE

00:53:00.344 --> 00:53:03.714 region:rollup2
OSTRACIZED FROM THE COMMUNITIES

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:05.382 region:rollup2
AND THEIR OWN FAMILIES FOR

00:53:03.714 --> 00:53:06.717 region:rollup2
SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE FAMILY.

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:07.584 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:09.253 region:rollup2
THAT WE NECESSARILY DO IT

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:09.920 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING THAT

00:53:09.253 --> 00:53:10.521 region:rollup2
HAPPENS ON THE RED STATES ON THE

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.456 region:rollup2
ROADS.

00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:14.758 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY --

00:53:12.456 --> 00:53:16.226 region:rollup2
DOT IS PART OF OF HOW WE'RE

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:17.394 region:rollup2
RAISED.

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:19.029 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN IT'S DUE TO TRUST

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:21.565 region:rollup2
ISSUE I THINK IT'S A CULTURAL

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:22.199 region:rollup2
THING -- ARE

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:23.934 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE IN THE MISSING AND

00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:26.336 region:rollup2
MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN THE

00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:27.471 region:rollup2
COUNTY IN THE NATION AND EVEN IN

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:29.707 region:rollup2
OUR STATE.

00:53:27.471 --> 00:53:31.442 region:rollup2
IS THROUGH THE ROOF OUR NUMBERS

00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:32.609 region:rollup2
ARE UNDER REPORTED AND THAT IS

00:53:31.442 --> 00:53:34.111 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CODED

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:36.380 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY AT A NATIONAL LEVEL.

00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:38.749 region:rollup2
OF WE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HISPANIC

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:40.117 region:rollup2
NOT AMERICAN INDIAN OR OTHER OR

00:53:38.749 --> 00:53:41.518 region:rollup2
MULTIRACIAL --

00:53:40.117 --> 00:53:42.386 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:44.088 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO'S ONE

00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:44.855 region:rollup2
RACE AND SO IT JUST SEEMS TO

00:53:44.088 --> 00:53:46.657 region:rollup2
MAKE SENSE THAT EVERYBODY WOULD

00:53:44.855 --> 00:53:48.525 region:rollup2
BE BOP MULTIRACIAL BUT

00:53:46.657 --> 00:53:50.494 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY NOT MARKES --

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:52.696 region:rollup2
I WILL CLOSE WITH THIS AS FAR AS

00:53:50.494 --> 00:53:53.530 region:rollup2
YOU SPEAKING ABOUT THE LAWS AND

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:54.965 region:rollup2
HOW.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:56.867 region:rollup2
THINGS NEED TO BE CHANGED --

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:58.569 region:rollup2
IN FEBRUARY SEVENTH KADISHA

00:53:56.867 --> 00:53:59.369 region:rollup2
BRITAIN OF COAL BELOW.

00:53:58.569 --> 00:54:02.039 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE SHE'S Y. LACKEY TRIBE

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:04.007 region:rollup2
SHE ONE FEBRUARY [inaudible]

00:54:02.039 --> 00:54:07.411 region:rollup2
SEVEN TEN POINT.

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:08.812 region:rollup2
THE WEEK BEFORE HER ATTACKER --

00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:09.913 region:rollup2
HER ABUSER ATTACKED HER WITH A

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:11.448 region:rollup2
HAMMER.

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:12.149 region:rollup2
SHE REPORTED THIS TO DOMESTIC

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.217 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE --

00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:17.621 region:rollup2
SERVICES UP IN KABUL WHERE SHE

00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:18.922 region:rollup2
LIVES BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT FOUND.

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:20.524 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE SHE STILL MISSING

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:21.758 region:rollup2
THE CHARGES AGAINST HIS

00:54:20.524 --> 00:54:23.827 region:rollup2
KIDNAPPING HIS KIDNAPPING

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:24.561 region:rollup2
CHARGES HAVE BEEN DROPPED.

00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:26.196 region:rollup2
THEIR STATEMENT WAS NOBODY NO

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:28.432 region:rollup2
VICTIM.

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:30.567 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT FAMILIES THERE ARE

00:54:28.432 --> 00:54:33.003 region:rollup2
SUFFERING THE RESOURCES ARE VERY

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:35.372 region:rollup2
VERY LIMITED AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:37.141 region:rollup2
DOESN'T NECESSARILY SEEM. TO

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:38.475 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL OF THOSE YOU KNOW THEY

00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:40.043 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE LOOPHOLES AS WELL I

00:54:38.475 --> 00:54:41.044 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND NOT BUT AT THE SAME

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:43.747 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:46.049 region:rollup2
SHE'S MISSING BECAUSE BECAUSE

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:46.583 region:rollup2
SHE IS AND SO OF COURSE THEY'RE

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:49.119 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:50.487 region:rollup2
PROSECUTE BUT AT THE SAME TIME.

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:52.823 region:rollup2
YOU NOW SEIZE HOLD THE GUN POINT

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:54.358 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE FAMILIES ALL WE CAN

00:54:52.823 --> 00:54:56.827 region:rollup2
DO IS PRAY FOR THEM AND ALL WE

00:54:54.358 --> 00:54:58.829 region:rollup2
CAN DO IS SPEAK OUT. FOR THEM

00:54:56.827 --> 00:55:00.597 region:rollup2
MOTHERS WHO BRIAN HERE ON THAT

00:54:58.829 --> 00:55:01.832 region:rollup2
IS DEFINITELY STILL AN INVISIBLE

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:04.201 region:rollup2

OUR LOW INCOME AT WE'VE --

00:55:46.143 --> 00:55:51.014 region:rollup2

00:56:12.903 --> 00:56:16.773 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT IN LA THAN IT

DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH ACCESS TO

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:25.282 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:27.484 region:rollup2

CLIENTS WHO ARE GOING TO BE

00:56:37.094 --> 00:56:40.330 region:rollup2

BARRIERS.

00:56:47.271 --> 00:56:50.841 region:rollup2
AND THAT OFTEN HAS TO DO WITH

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:52.943 region:rollup2
THEM EITHER LIVING IN AN

00:56:50.841 --> 00:56:55.212 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY OR SIMPLY

00:56:52.943 --> 00:56:57.180 region:rollup2

ABOUT LEGAL SERVICES I MEAN ON

00:57:00.617 --> 00:57:03.520 region:rollup2
THE ONE SIDE THERE'S THE

00:57:01.318 --> 00:57:04.721 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL SIDE OF THINGS WHERE

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.023 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT OUGHT TO BE

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:08.358 region:rollup2
ARRESTING PEOPLE.

00:57:06.023 --> 00:57:09.693 region:rollup2
AND OUGHT TO BE THE DA'S OFFICE

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:10.294 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO BE CHARGING THEM AND

00:57:09.693 --> 00:57:11.595 region:rollup2
THEY OUGHT TO BE HOLDING THEM

00:57:10.294 --> 00:57:12.963 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE.

00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:16.800 region:rollup2
BUT THEN WE'VE GOT.

00:57:12.963 --> 00:57:17.567 region:rollup2
VICTIMS WHO ARE UNWILLING. TO TO

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.269 region:rollup2

THEY DO THEY MAKE IT SO THE SOME

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.811 region:rollup2
OF THOSE CASES DON'T MOVE

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:29.880 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:32.416 region:rollup2

VICTIMS WHOSE PERPETRATOR.

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:38.255 region:rollup2
IS ALL LAWYER UP AND HAS

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:39.623 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND SHE'S GOING TO

00:57:38.255 --> 00:57:41.658 region:rollup2
HAVE A VERY POOR OUTCOME.

00:57:39.623 --> 00:57:42.659 region:rollup2
IN HER CIVIL SIDE OF THINGS

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:43.894 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT RESTRAINING ORDER

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:45.529 region:rollup2
IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE

00:57:43.894 --> 00:57:46.863 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION FROM WE'VE.

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:48.699 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THEN AS YOU SAID IT'S

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:50.667 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE THREE YEARS IT IT

00:57:48.699 --> 00:57:53.003 region:rollup2
COULD NEVER BECOME A PERMANENT.

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:54.404 region:rollup2
PERMANENT STAY AWAY ORDER AND

00:57:53.003 --> 00:57:56.673 region:rollup2
SHE SCRAMBLING TO FIGURE OUT

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:57.641 region:rollup2
WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO ONCE THAT

00:57:56.673 --> 00:57:59.476 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDERS --

00:57:57.641 --> 00:58:00.911 region:rollup2
GONE.

00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:02.145 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE OF THE GREAT STRIDES

00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:04.514 region:rollup2
WE'VE MADE IN THE LAST FORTY

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:05.615 region:rollup2
YEARS IS THAT PEOPLE PEOPLE ALL

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.817 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH SAY OKAY DOMESTIC

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:07.884 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE IS A BAD THING IT'S NOT

00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:09.519 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT KEEP BEHIND

00:58:07.884 --> 00:58:10.654 region:rollup2
CLOSED DOORS.

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:12.823 region:rollup2
BUT EVERYBODY STILL PICTURES

00:58:10.654 --> 00:58:14.024 region:rollup2
THAT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AND IF

00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:15.359 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY EVEN THOUGH THE PEOPLE

00:58:14.024 --> 00:58:17.361 region:rollup2
WE SERVE.

00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:17.894 region:rollup2
IF THEY WERE NEVER HIT OR IF

00:58:17.361 --> 00:58:19.129 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:22.566 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL IT WAS --

00:58:19.129 --> 00:58:24.301 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL ABUSE FINANCIAL ABUSE.

00:58:22.566 --> 00:58:24.868 region:rollup2
SPIRITUAL OF YOU ABUSE THEY

00:58:24.301 --> 00:58:26.136 region:rollup2
ALMOST FEEL LIKE IT DOESN'T

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:28.205 region:rollup2
COUNT.

00:58:26.136 --> 00:58:29.606 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WHERE WHERE PEOPLE

00:58:28.205 --> 00:58:31.942 region:rollup2
FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IS YOU

00:58:29.606 --> 00:58:34.811 region:rollup2
GET A CRAFTY ABUSER WHO'S DOING

00:58:31.942 --> 00:58:37.581 region:rollup2
ALL KINDS OF AGGRESSIVE IN POWER

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:38.815 region:rollup2
WIELDING THINGS LIKE SHOWING UP

00:58:37.581 --> 00:58:39.449 region:rollup2
AT AT SOMEBODY'S.

00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:43.220 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY'S COMMITTEE MEETINGS OR

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:44.921 region:rollup2
I KINGS SOMEBODY BUT DOING IT IN

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:46.189 region:rollup2
A PRETTY CRAFTY WAY IT'S HARD

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:47.491 region:rollup2
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO REST THAT

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:48.225 region:rollup2
PERSON IT'S HARD TO HOLD THEM

00:58:47.491 --> 00:58:50.861 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE.

00:58:48.225 --> 00:58:51.895 region:rollup2
AND AND VICTIMS ARE LEFT FEELING

00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:54.798 region:rollup2
LIKE WELL NOBODY'S GONNA BELIEVE

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:56.733 region:rollup2
ME AND I HAVE NO RESOURCES.

00:58:54.798 --> 00:58:57.768 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF STATISTICS

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:59.636 region:rollup2
OUT THERE BUT THERE AREN'T VERY

00:58:57.768 --> 00:59:01.204 region:rollup2
GOOD STATISTICS I THINK THAT'S

00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:02.739 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:04.674 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS.

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:07.044 region:rollup2
WHAT WE KNOW HOW MANY --

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:08.879 region:rollup2
CALLS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE --

00:59:07.044 --> 00:59:10.847 region:rollup2
RELATED CRIMES ARE WHERE IT IT'S

00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:11.448 region:rollup2
ALWAYS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:12.416 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND THAT'S WHAT IT'S

00:59:11.448 --> 00:59:13.950 region:rollup2
BEEN FOR THE LAST. TEN YEARS IT

00:59:12.416 --> 00:59:16.353 region:rollup2
SH.

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:18.488 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THAT --

00:59:16.353 --> 00:59:19.890 region:rollup2
IN THOSE CASES ABOUT 40% OF THE

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:21.858 region:rollup2
TIME THERE WAS A WEAPON USED

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:23.260 region:rollup2
USUALLY THE PERPETRATOR'S BODY

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:25.228 region:rollup2
IT'S OF PFISTER OF FOOT OR

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:26.897 region:rollup2
SOMETHING NOT SO MUCH --

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:28.365 region:rollup2
WEAPONS WE THINK OF AS WEAPONS

00:59:26.897 --> 00:59:29.566 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S ALL WE KNOW AND WE

00:59:28.365 --> 00:59:30.667 region:rollup2
ALSO KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:32.135 region:rollup2
CALLING ON FOR SMITH THEY'RE

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:33.403 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LIVING IN A COMMUNITY

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:34.171 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU DON'T DO THAT.

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:35.038 region:rollup2
YOU -- YOU

00:59:34.171 --> 00:59:36.740 region:rollup2
EITHER DON'T TRUST LAW

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:38.141 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OR YOU'RE JUST NOT

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.509 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO THAT.

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:40.744 region:rollup2
SO THOSE STATISTICS AREN'T

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:41.711 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY HELPFUL WHEN WE

00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:42.312 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE INCIDENTS OF

00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:45.182 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN OUR STATE

00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:47.851 region:rollup2
--

00:59:45.182 --> 00:59:49.352 region:rollup2
I WILL TELL YOU THAT.

00:59:47.851 --> 00:59:51.822 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE MOSTLY

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:53.990 region:rollup2
SERVING NEED HOUSING THEY NEED

00:59:51.822 --> 00:59:54.958 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION THEY NEED CHILD

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:58.528 region:rollup2
CARE.

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:58.528 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY NEED A JOB AND

00:59:58.595 --> 01:00:03.200 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND THEIR PAST ALREADY

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:05.469 region:rollup2
COMPROMISED THROUGH DECO WEARS

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.837 region:rollup2
AN IDENTITY THEFT FRAUD.

01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:08.071 region:rollup2
EVICTIONS WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:10.407 region:rollup2
BEEN THE ONE TO BE A BIT EVICTED

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:13.110 region:rollup2
BUT LANDLORDS DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:15.111 region:rollup2
THAT ONE BIG HOLE RIGHT NOW IS

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:17.547 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN MOBILE HOME

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:19.916 region:rollup2
PARKS THE THE LAWS ABOUT.

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:20.951 region:rollup2
EVICTION DON'T APPLY BECAUSE

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.419 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RENTING THE LAND BUT YOU

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:24.120 region:rollup2
OWN THE HOUSE AND THAT'S A

01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:25.188 region:rollup2
THAT'S A HUGE HOLE IN OUR

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.756 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTION

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.691 region:rollup2
LAWS BECAUSE TOO OFTEN VICTIMS

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:28.992 region:rollup2
ARE BEING.

01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:30.393 region:rollup2
EVICTED WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T BE

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:31.094 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAW

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:32.696 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT THEM [inaudible]

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.663 region:rollup2
COME.

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:36.032 region:rollup2

PEOPLE WE SERVE HAVE SOME KIND

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:40.604 region:rollup2
OF FINANCIAL ABUSE AND THAT IS

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:42.005 region:rollup2
WHAT HOLDS PEOPLE DOWN I MEAN IT

01:00:40.604 --> 01:00:44.541 region:rollup2

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.945 region:rollup2
VICTIMS ARE THE REALLY THE

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:52.616 region:rollup2
HIDDEN HOMELESS IN OUR

OF THEM AS BEING HOMELESS.

MULTIPLE COMMITTEES AT THE SAME

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:35.899 region:rollup2
TIME -- BUT

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:38.001 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO COME HERE TO ADD MY

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:39.636 region:rollup2
VOICE -- MY

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:41.104 region:rollup2
MOTHER FOR A LONG TIME WORKED AT

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:43.139 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE CENTERS THAT YOU

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:45.208 region:rollup2

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:46.743 region:rollup2
CALL IT THE MARJORIE MASONS AND

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:49.145 region:rollup2
IT'S A PLACE WHERE.

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:51.181 region:rollup2
FAR TOO OFTEN WOMEN AND KIDS ARE

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:52.749 region:rollup2
FORCED TO GO BECAUSE OF THE

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:54.684 region:rollup2
POVERTY AND EXPERIENCES FROM MY

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:56.653 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:59.522 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT WE MUST DO MUCH

01:05:56.653 --> 01:06:01.558 region:rollup2
MORE TO COMBAT THIS CRISIS.

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:02.992 region:rollup2
I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT WE

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:04.527 region:rollup2
NEED TO LOOK AT A TO GENERATION

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.395 region:rollup2
MODEL TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:07.430 region:rollup2
ARE NOT LEARNING FROM THEIR

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:09.599 region:rollup2
PARENTS.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:11.267 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THAT MUST COME FROM

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:12.502 region:rollup2
US ACKNOWLEDGING THE TRAUMA THAT

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:14.971 region:rollup2
THEY EXPERIENCE.

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:16.706 region:rollup2
FROM HAVING WATCHED THIS FIRST

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:19.075 region:rollup2
HAND HAVING SEEN IT.

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:21.511 region:rollup2
AND HAVING LEARNED FROM IT.

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:23.479 region:rollup2
WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY.

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:25.315 region:rollup2
AND HOUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS THAT

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:26.749 region:rollup2
TRAUMA REALLY WILL HELP US TO

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:29.018 region:rollup2
GIVE US THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:30.353 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD.

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:31.554 region:rollup2
BUT I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT IF

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:34.791 region:rollup2
I COULD TO REALLY DRILL INTO

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:36.926 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE OF POVERTY.

01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:39.529 region:rollup2
POVERTY ITSELF IS DRAMATIC.

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:41.297 region:rollup2

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.933 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO A POOR PEOPLE'S

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:46.402 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN.

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:48.371 region:rollup2
A MOVEMENT IN OUR NATION.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:49.706 region:rollup2
A MORAL REVIVAL.

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:51.007 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:52.942 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING IN OUR

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:54.377 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES EACH AND EVERY DAY

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:56.513 region:rollup2
IN OUR BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:57.780 region:rollup2
OUR VALUES.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:07:00.650 region:rollup2
IN A FOR NOT WILLING TO STAND UP

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:02.418 region:rollup2
IN COMBAT THIS INCOME INEQUALITY

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.453 region:rollup2
AND POVERTY THAT WE SEE IN OUR

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:05.121 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE SO MANY

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:06.322 region:rollup2
MILLIONAIRES.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:08.424 region:rollup2
AND SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CANNOT

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:10.426 region:rollup2
PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:13.229 region:rollup2
THAT I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE WE

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:15.431 region:rollup2
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO.

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:17.834 region:rollup2
STAND UP AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:19.802 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT WE SEE.

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:21.304 region:rollup2
THE CRIMES THAT ARE COMMITTED

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:22.872 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN OUR

ADMINISTERED THROUGH HHS AT THE

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:45.608 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:10:43.306 --> 01:10:47.310 region:rollup2

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:49.525 region:rollup2
NEEDS THAT THERE MAY

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:50.459 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:51.961 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:52.995 region:rollup2
AND DESPITE THE GREAT WORK THESE

01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:55.030 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE DOING THE GAPS

01:18:52.995 --> 01:18:57.967 region:rollup2
REMAIN --

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:59.168 region:rollup2
OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD THE AVERAGE

01:18:57.967 --> 01:19:01.670 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF UNMET NEED UNMET

01:18:59.168 --> 01:19:02.871 region:rollup2
REQUEST FOR SHELTER WAS OVER

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.439 region:rollup2
THIRTY TWO THOUSAND REQUESTS

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:04.607 region:rollup2
WHICH AGAIN INTERSECTS WITH

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:06.108 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:19:04.607 --> 01:19:08.744 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLE NEED WE SEE AROUND

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:09.044 region:rollup2
HOUSING AND A MUST PATENTS

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:10.779 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:12.748 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:14.249 region:rollup2
AS WE THINK ABOUT IMMEDIATE AND

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:17.319 region:rollup2
LONG TERM NEEDS THE FOCUS IS

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:19.722 region:rollup2
OFTEN ON IMMEDIATE MEANS RIGHT

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:21.690 region:rollup2
WING HAVE BUILT A STRONG.

01:19:19.722 --> 01:19:23.325 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY CRISIS RESPONSE THAT

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.927 region:rollup2
WITH EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:26.262 region:rollup2
CRISIS HOTLINES.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.863 region:rollup2
AND WHAT CAN OFTEN BE MOST

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:29.331 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING AS TO HOW TO HELP

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:30.499 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS THROUGH LONG TERM

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:33.702 region:rollup2
STABILITY.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:35.070 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE HELP SURVIVORS HOUSING

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:36.939 region:rollup2
THAT IS PERMANENT AND AFFORDABLE

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:38.007 region:rollup2
AND STABLE?

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:41.210 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:42.678 region:rollup2
AND CALL.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:44.546 region:rollup2
FOR ALL WHILE SURVIVORS ARE

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:46.282 region:rollup2
TRYING TO REBUILD THEIR CREDIT

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:47.483 region:rollup2
FI NEW EMPLOYMENT.

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.084 region:rollup2
DEAL FOR HIM DEAL WITH THE

01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:50.653 region:rollup2
TRAUMA THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:51.987 region:rollup2
HELP THEIR CHILDREN BE A SAFE IN

01:19:50.653 --> 01:19:53.622 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SO THESE LONG TERM

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:55.324 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS THE ABILITY FOR

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:57.359 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:19:55.324 --> 01:20:00.029 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THAT TRANSITION TIME AND

01:19:57.359 --> 01:20:02.431 region:rollup2
WORK WITH SURVIVORS OF LONG TERM

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:03.632 region:rollup2
IS INCREDIBLY ASSUMPTION.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:04.967 region:rollup2
IT'S WHY SOME OF THE PROGRAMS

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.969 region:rollup2
LIKE THE CAL WORKS TEMPORARY

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:08.671 region:rollup2
HOUSING AND OTHER SUPPORTS ARE

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:09.772 region:rollup2
SO VITAL AND I KNOW MY

01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:11.373 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL WILL

01:20:09.772 --> 01:20:14.977 region:rollup2
SPEAK AT HOME. TO THOSE IN

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:18.047 region:rollup2
GREATER DETAIL.

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:19.248 region:rollup2
SO UNDERLYING ALL OF THESE NEEDS

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:22.017 region:rollup2
IS REALLY THE ECONOMIC REALITY

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:24.186 region:rollup2
AND A YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:26.322 region:rollup2
WORKS AND CALL FRESH FROM OTHERS

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:27.623 region:rollup2
BUT DIDN'T A LIFT UP THE FACT

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.590 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A RECENT REPORT

01:20:27.623 --> 01:20:30.859 region:rollup2
FROM THE NATIONAL RESOURCE

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:32.328 region:rollup2
CENTER ON TO MY VIOLENCE.

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:34.063 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS TITLED THE

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:36.198 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURVIVING AND

01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:38.200 region:rollup2
NOT SURVIVING AND THE ESSENTIAL

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:40.736 region:rollup2
ROLE OF PUBLIC BENEFITS.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:43.138 region:rollup2
IN THE ROLE REALLY IS THAT STARK

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:44.306 region:rollup2
COME BY NO MEANS IS THAT THE

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.908 region:rollup2
TITLE OF WITHOUT REPORT

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:47.676 region:rollup2
HYPERBOLIC.

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:49.812 region:rollup2
SO A FEW HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:50.179 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT I JUST WANNA LIFT UP

01:20:49.812 --> 01:20:51.413 region:rollup2
FOR YOU ALL.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:52.848 region:rollup2
ASIDE.

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:54.616 region:rollup2
OF THE ADVOCATES THAT WERE

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:56.351 region:rollup2
SURVEYED NATIONWIDE ABOUT THE

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:58.053 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF TEN OFTEN STOP THE

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:59.822 region:rollup2
FEDERAL PROGRAMS GOVERNING

01:20:58.053 --> 01:21:01.156 region:rollup2
CULBERTSON CAO FRENCH.

01:20:59.822 --> 01:21:03.258 region:rollup2
MORE THAN TWO THIRDS SAY THAT

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:04.326 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS RELY

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:06.095 region:rollup2
ON TOWN OF TO MEET THEIR BASIC

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:08.464 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:11.967 region:rollup2
AT NEARLY 80% SAY THE SAME OF

01:21:08.464 --> 01:21:13.569 region:rollup2
SNAP USER VITAL VITAL PROGRAMS.

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:14.636 region:rollup2
AND SURVIVORS THEMSELVES

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:16.372 region:rollup2
REPORTED AT THAT THEM

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:17.940 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE SERVICES

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:19.174 region:rollup2
WERE AND WHAT BENEFITS THEY

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:20.876 region:rollup2
COULD PROVIDE.

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:22.511 region:rollup2
AND BE ELIGIBLE FOR WAS THE

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.946 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW THEY

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:25.180 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ABOUT LEAVING WHETHER OR

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:27.850 region:rollup2
NOT THEY WERE ABLE TO LEAVE AND

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:29.418 region:rollup2
HOW TO DO SO WHERE TO GO.

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:31.186 region:rollup2
MANY SURVIVORS WHO FIND

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:32.921 region:rollup2
THEMSELVESAND POVERTY IN IN

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:34.923 region:rollup2
CRISIS HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:36.258 region:rollup2
OF SKILL AND SKILLS THAT WILL

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:39.194 region:rollup2
MAKE THEM --

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:41.330 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ECONOMICALLY STABLE AND

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:42.931 region:rollup2
BUT THEY NEED THE INTERIM

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:44.800 region:rollup2
SUPPORT WHILE THEY DEAL WITH

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:47.202 region:rollup2
TRAUMA AND REESTABLISH THEIR

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:51.073 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ANTENNA

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:52.808 region:rollup2
FINS SNAP ARE KEY PARTS OF THAT.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:54.643 region:rollup2
I'M THESE PROGRAMS GIVE THEM A

01:21:52.808 --> 01:21:55.611 region:rollup2
MEANS TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:57.212 region:rollup2
AND THEIR FAMILIES WHILE THEY

01:21:55.611 --> 01:21:58.680 region:rollup2
BUILD THEIR LIFESPAN.

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:59.982 region:rollup2
THEM AND YET THEY ARE NOT

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.717 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THEIR CHALLENGES AND

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:04.153 region:rollup2
BEAT BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T

01:22:01.717 --> 01:22:06.555 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGE BUTTONS.

01:22:04.153 --> 01:22:08.557 region:rollup2
SO LESS THAN HALF OF AND THE

01:22:06.555 --> 01:22:09.491 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES SURVEYED SAID THAT

01:22:08.557 --> 01:22:10.793 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC PHONE SURVIVORS WERE

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:12.828 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE BENEFITS

01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:14.797 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY NEED AT THEM.

01:22:12.828 --> 01:22:16.431 region:rollup2
MANY SURVIVORS FEEL LIKE THEY

01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:17.900 region:rollup2
CAN'T ACCESS THOSE BENEFITS

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:19.768 region:rollup2
WITHOUT AN ADVOCATE WITHOUT

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.969 region:rollup2
WHICH SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE HIGH

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:23.105 region:rollup2
BARRIER TO ENTRY.

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:24.706 region:rollup2
AND HOW COMPLEX THOSE PROCESS

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:26.675 region:rollup2
USE OF SIMPLY APPLYING FOR AND

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:26.975 region:rollup2
RECEIVING THESE BENEFITS CAN BE

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:28.577 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:30.179 region:rollup2
UP.

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:31.647 region:rollup2
RESPONDENTS WHO WERE WORKING

01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:33.649 region:rollup2
WITH LGBT --

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:34.983 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS IMMIGRANT SURVIVORS

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:37.386 region:rollup2
THOSE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:38.987 region:rollup2
PROFICIENCY ESPECIALLY RAISED UP

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:40.956 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES AND STRUGGLES OF

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:42.324 region:rollup2
ACCESSING AND THESE PROGRAMS

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:43.392 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:47.529 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FEELING THE SAFE IN

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:48.864 region:rollup2
DOING SO. ONE QUOTE THAT I'LL

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:49.531 region:rollup2
JUST SHARE FROM THE REPORT WAS

01:22:48.864 --> 01:22:51.133 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:52.968 region:rollup2
TENER FAILS MOST WOMEN WITH

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:54.837 region:rollup2
CHILDREN BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:56.071 region:rollup2
TO ACCESS OPPOSED TO MANY HOOPS

01:22:54.837 --> 01:22:57.806 region:rollup2
TO JUMP THROUGH FIRST MALL

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:59.374 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF FUNDING.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:01.410 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS IS FRUSTRATING AND

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:02.711 region:rollup2
INTRUSIVE FOR MOST AND DOESN'T

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:04.179 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOR REAL ASSISTANCE WITH

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:06.048 region:rollup2
THE REALITY FACED BY THE CYCLE

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:08.217 region:rollup2
OF POVERTY.

01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:10.619 region:rollup2
SO NAY INCREDIBLE BRIDGE PROGRAM

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:12.621 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT DO SO MUCH FOR

01:23:10.619 --> 01:23:14.189 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS AND STILL --

01:23:12.621 --> 01:23:15.924 region:rollup2
MORE WORK REMAINS ARMS SO GLAD

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:18.093 region:rollup2
THAT WHERE HAVING THIS HEARING

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:19.561 region:rollup2
ABLE TO LIFT UP THE SUCCESSES

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:20.896 region:rollup2
AND CHALLENGES.

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:24.366 region:rollup2
AND SOLUTIONS WE CAN WORK FOR

01:23:20.896 --> 01:23:25.834 region:rollup2
ITSELF --

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:26.468 region:rollup2
FOR FOR THIS HEARING AND FOR THE

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:29.705 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:30.772 region:rollup2
THIS COMPLEX ISSUE.

01:23:29.705 --> 01:23:34.910 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:35.944 region:rollup2
COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:37.546 region:rollup2
COULD YOU ACTUALLY JUST REALLY

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:40.215 region:rollup2
THAT QUOTE [inaudible]

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:42.517 region:rollup2
I KEPT [inaudible]

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:45.721 region:rollup2
SO.

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:47.589 region:rollup2
THE QUOTE IS TENER FAILS MOST

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:50.259 region:rollup2
WOMEN WITH CHILDREN BECAUSE IT

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:52.127 region:rollup2
IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS AND HAS

01:23:50.259 --> 01:23:54.229 region:rollup2
TOO MANY HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH.

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:55.998 region:rollup2
FIRST SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING.

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:58.100 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS IS FRUSTRATING AND

01:23:55.998 --> 01:23:59.334 region:rollup2
INTRUSIVE FOR MOST.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:01.069 region:rollup2
AND DOESN'T ALLOW FOR REAL

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:05.574 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE WITH THE REALITY

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:07.843 region:rollup2
FACED BY THE CYCLE OF POVERTY.

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:09.611 region:rollup2
SO THE SURVEY THAT YOU PROVIDED

01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:12.014 region:rollup2
INDICATED PEOPLE DO SEE THE

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:13.749 region:rollup2
VALUE OF IT.

01:24:12.014 --> 01:24:15.350 region:rollup2
BUT THE VALUE IS OFFSET BY THE

01:24:13.749 --> 01:24:17.085 region:rollup2
CUMBERSOME BURDENSOME INTRUSIVE

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:19.621 region:rollup2
NESS.

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:21.490 region:rollup2
THE LOAN AMOUNT OF THE BENEFITS

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:23.091 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY LOT OF MEMBERS FOR A

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:25.761 region:rollup2
LIMITED DIEM.

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:28.430 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS A BETTER TOOL THAN.

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:31.099 region:rollup2
NO TWO ABSOLUTELY ARE IT IS

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:33.368 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL IT IS SORT OF PEOPLE

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:36.038 region:rollup2
RESORT TO IT.

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:37.205 region:rollup2
BUT IS VERY BURDENSOME DE.

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:38.974 region:rollup2
AVAIL THEMSELVES.

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:40.709 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW AGAIN I WILL SAY

01:24:38.974 --> 01:24:42.978 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A NATIONAL SERVICE OF

01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:44.980 region:rollup2
THOSE EXPERIENCES DIFFER.

01:24:42.978 --> 01:24:47.082 region:rollup2
A STATE BY STATE PER OUT IMAGINE

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:49.918 region:rollup2
COUNTY BY COUNTY OF IN SOME WAYS

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:51.620 region:rollup2

ALSO UNCODIFIED AS WELL.

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:51.332 region:rollup2
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:32:49.998 --> 01:32:53.334 region:rollup2
CHANGES ARE WHAT'S GOING TO

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:55.570 region:rollup2
HAPPEN NEXT MONTH ARM.

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:56.538 region:rollup2

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:58.640 region:rollup2
FIVE FIVE SEVEN AND THAT IS ON

01:32:56.538 --> 01:33:00.241 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY A NEW ESSENTIALLY

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.143 region:rollup2

THAT BENEFIT WILL BE AVAILABLE.

01:33:09.451 --> 01:33:14.823 region:rollup2
AND THE HUGE CHANGE IS.

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:18.159 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY A BARRIER TO GETTING

01:33:14.823 --> 01:33:19.627 region:rollup2
TO CAL WORKS WAS THAT IF YOU.

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:21.496 region:rollup2
CAME DIRECTLY FROM AN ABUSER'S

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:23.498 region:rollup2
HOME.

01:33:21.496 --> 01:33:24.966 region:rollup2
I TRY TO APPLY FOR CAL WORKS WE

01:33:23.498 --> 01:33:27.902 region:rollup2
WOULD COUNT THE INCOME AND

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:29.604 region:rollup2
ASSETS OF THE ABUSER.

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:31.339 region:rollup2
AT AGAINST YOUR ARM AGAINST

ESSENTIALLY OUR CASE THAT WASN'T

01:33:31.339 --> 01:33:34.275 region:rollup2
THE CASE IF YOU'RE IN A SHELTER

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:36.044 region:rollup2
BUT YOU CAME DIRECTLY.

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:38.713 region:rollup2
SO PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:33:36.044 --> 01:33:40.582 region:rollup2
CHANGES WERE SUFFERING THAT FOR

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:42.050 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY THE RECEIPT OF THE

01:33:40.582 --> 01:33:44.686 region:rollup2

SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY.

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:48.323 region:rollup2

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:50.458 region:rollup2
TO EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY

01:33:48.323 --> 01:33:54.829 region:rollup2

THE THOSE ARE HUGE CHANGES THOSE

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:59.133 region:rollup2
ARE THOSE ARE THOSE THOSE ARE

01:33:57.665 --> 01:34:00.468 region:rollup2
YET TO COME THROUGH AND THEY

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.669 region:rollup2
GOING TO AFFECT NEXT MONTH.

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.271 region:rollup2

LETTER THAT WAS ISSUED.

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:18.486 region:rollup2
BACK IN MARCH --

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:21.022 region:rollup2
A FEW A FEW DATA POINTS ABOUT

AND IT IS DESIGNED TO BE A VERY

01:34:27.929 --> 01:34:32.767 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE TOOL AND ESSENTIALLY

01:34:31.266 --> 01:34:33.968 region:rollup2
IT'S A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:34.469 region:rollup2
DEPENDING OF THOSE QUESTIONS ARE

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:35.970 region:rollup2

BE ADDRESSED DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:34:51.686 --> 01:34:55.690 region:rollup2
MEAN THERE IS --

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:57.025 region:rollup2
THAT THE CLIENT ARM.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.526 region:rollup2

01:34:57.025 --> 01:34:59.861 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:01.329 region:rollup2
IT'D BEEN DISCUSSED AND A CHOICE

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:02.230 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE BECAUSE IT

01:35:01.329 --> 01:35:03.331 region:rollup2
WAS IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIAL

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:05.967 region:rollup2

01:35:07.735 --> 01:35:10.905 region:rollup2
PIECE OF DATA WHICH ACTUALLY IS

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:12.407 region:rollup2
MUCH THAT IS A MUCH SMALLER

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:14.008 region:rollup2

21% I MENTIONED EARLIER.

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:42.170 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT IS A FUNCTION OF IT

01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:44.572 region:rollup2

01:46:24.678 --> 01:46:27.348 region:rollup2
ON THE ADULT WHILE THE FAMILY

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:29.483 region:rollup2
STABILIZATION ONE CLEARLY WAS

01:46:27.348 --> 01:46:30.684 region:rollup2
DESIGNED.

01:46:29.483 --> 01:46:32.019 region:rollup2
IT WAS SORT A BEFORE THE TO CHEN

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:33.220 region:rollup2

WHOLE FAMILY.

01:46:36.423 --> 01:46:40.127 region:rollup2
IT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT ABOUT

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:42.296 region:rollup2
HOW WELL DO WE SCREEN BEYOND

01:46:40.127 --> 01:46:43.631 region:rollup2
WHAT ACCOUNT IS DOING AND AND

01:46:42.296 --> 01:46:45.199 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PARENTS ARE CHOOSING TO

01:46:43.631 --> 01:46:46.433 region:rollup2
DISCLOSE ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN'S

01:46:45.199 --> 01:46:47.101 region:rollup2
NEEDS AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN'S

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:49.103 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF FACT.

01:46:47.101 --> 01:46:50.437 region:rollup2
ON THAT I THINK.

01:46:49.103 --> 01:46:52.573 region:rollup2
I THINK IT INTERESTING AT THE

01:46:50.437 --> 01:46:54.041 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LEVEL DEBATE IS ON

01:46:52.573 --> 01:46:56.310 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY THEY'RE TALKING

01:46:54.041 --> 01:46:57.778 region:rollup2
ABOUT ADDING CHILD COM.

01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:59.246 region:rollup2
REDUCING CHILD POVERTY AS

01:46:57.778 --> 01:47:01.482 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY A GOAL OF THE TANF

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:02.549 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS NOT CURRENTLY ON BUT

01:47:01.482 --> 01:47:03.884 region:rollup2
I THINK --

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:04.852 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE VERSION THAT I'VE

01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:06.453 region:rollup2
SEEN OF THAT AT THE FEDERAL

01:47:04.852 --> 01:47:08.055 region:rollup2
LEVEL SPEAK IN TERMS OF ONLY

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:09.123 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT CHILD POVERTY IN

01:47:08.055 --> 01:47:10.991 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THEIR PARENTS INCOME

01:47:09.123 --> 01:47:11.926 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

01:47:10.991 --> 01:47:14.028 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN HAVE SO MANY MORE

01:47:11.926 --> 01:47:15.663 region:rollup2
NEED SO I HOPE OF CONGRESS IS

01:47:14.028 --> 01:47:16.430 region:rollup2
THINKING OF ADDING THAT KIND OF

01:47:15.663 --> 01:47:17.898 region:rollup2
THING THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:19.667 region:rollup2
IDEA -- THEY

01:47:17.898 --> 01:47:20.601 region:rollup2
CAN THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE

01:47:19.667 --> 01:47:21.936 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN'S NEEDS BUT YOU

01:47:20.601 --> 01:47:24.338 region:rollup2

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:22.029 region:rollup2
BENEFITS BECAUSE HER ABUSER HAD

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:23.764 region:rollup2
THREATENED TO KILL HER.

01:53:22.029 --> 01:53:25.632 region:rollup2
IF THE COUNTY CAME AFTER HIM FOR

01:53:23.764 --> 01:53:26.566 region:rollup2
CHILD SUPPORT.

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:28.802 region:rollup2
NINE SO AFTER CONNECTING WITH

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:30.437 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT SOCIAL SERVICES

01:53:28.802 --> 01:53:31.905 region:rollup2
AND EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM I WAS

01:53:30.437 --> 01:53:33.640 region:rollup2
PROVIDED INFORMATION FOR THE

01:53:31.905 --> 01:53:35.909 region:rollup2
CLIENT TO FILE A GOOD CAUSE FORM

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:38.045 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD EXEMPT HER FROM THE

01:53:35.909 --> 01:53:38.979 region:rollup2
CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTION CARMEN.

01:53:38.045 --> 01:53:40.981 region:rollup2
SO THE CLIENT HAD TAKE THOUGHT

01:53:38.979 --> 01:53:42.182 region:rollup2
HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK WHICH

01:53:40.981 --> 01:53:43.517 region:rollup2
WAS ALREADY IN JEOPARDY OF

01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:45.519 region:rollup2
LOSING HER JOB BECAUSE OF THE

01:53:43.517 --> 01:53:45.986 region:rollup2
MISTAKES FROM ALL THE OTHER

01:53:45.519 --> 01:53:46.987 region:rollup2
PRIOR DOMESTIC ROUTES

01:53:45.986 --> 01:53:48.722 region:rollup2
INCIDENCES.

01:53:46.987 --> 01:53:49.890 region:rollup2
THE CLIENT APPLIED AND DURING

01:53:48.722 --> 01:53:51.124 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS THE CLAIM WAS

01:53:49.890 --> 01:53:52.459 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE WORKER

01:53:51.124 --> 01:53:53.527 region:rollup2
WITH THE ABUSERS INFORMATION

01:53:52.459 --> 01:53:55.662 region:rollup2
ANYWAYS WHICH MADE HER VERY

01:53:53.527 --> 01:53:56.463 region:rollup2
NERVOUS.

01:53:55.662 --> 01:53:58.332 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY SHE WITH THE NIGHT

01:53:56.463 --> 01:53:59.666 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY BENEFITS.

01:53:58.332 --> 01:54:01.134 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I COUNTY BENEFITS

01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:02.202 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF HER TWO THOUSAND

01:54:01.134 --> 01:54:04.471 region:rollup2
DOLLAR A MONTH INCOME WHAT'S TOO

01:54:02.202 --> 01:54:06.740 region:rollup2
HIGH.

01:54:04.471 --> 01:54:08.075 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS THE MOTHER OF THREE

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.543 region:rollup2
DO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE FAIR

01:54:08.075 --> 01:54:10.577 region:rollup2
MARKET RATE FOR STUDIO APARTMENT

01:54:09.543 --> 01:54:12.846 region:rollup2
ALAMEDA COUNTY IT'S EIGHTEEN

01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:14.081 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:54:12.846 --> 01:54:15.549 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY EVEN AFTER THE KIND

01:54:14.081 --> 01:54:17.017 region:rollup2
EXPLAINE HER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:54:15.549 --> 01:54:18.618 region:rollup2
SITUATION AND THAT USE CURRENTLY

01:54:17.017 --> 01:54:19.953 region:rollup2
HOMELESS IN OUR SHELTER.

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:21.021 region:rollup2
IT WOULD DISCOVERED IN A PROCESS

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:22.489 region:rollup2
THAT THE COUNTY HAD MADE A

01:54:21.021 --> 01:54:25.125 region:rollup2
MISTAKE IN CALCULATING HER

01:54:22.489 --> 01:54:25.692 region:rollup2
BENEFITS FROM.

01:54:25.125 --> 01:54:26.626 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IS NOW

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:28.095 region:rollup2
REQUIRING HER TO PAY BACK THE

01:54:26.626 --> 01:54:32.065 region:rollup2
OVERPAYMENT EVEN KNOW IF THE

01:54:28.095 --> 01:54:33.033 region:rollup2
COUNTY AIR.

01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:34.601 region:rollup2
SINCE THE KIND WITH THE NIGHT

01:54:33.033 --> 01:54:35.702 region:rollup2
BENEFITS SHE'S NOW INELIGIBLE

01:54:34.601 --> 01:54:37.304 region:rollup2
FOR THE COUNTY SUBSIDIZED

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:38.772 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE SERVICES WHICH WOULD

01:54:37.304 --> 01:54:40.774 region:rollup2
HAVE ALLOWED HER TO CONTINUE

01:54:38.772 --> 01:54:43.176 region:rollup2
WORKING FULL TIME.

01:54:40.774 --> 01:54:44.644 region:rollup2
SO THE STORY IS NOT UNIQUE.

01:54:43.176 --> 01:54:46.346 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER OTHER EXAMPLES I

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:48.248 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THAT OUR DAY

01:54:46.346 --> 01:54:49.549 region:rollup2
TO DAY CHALLENGES I OFTEN SEE.

01:54:48.248 --> 01:54:50.050 region:rollup2
CLIENTS LANGUAGES ARE NOT ALWAYS

01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:51.585 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATED WITH SOCIAL

01:54:50.050 --> 01:54:53.053 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:54:51.585 --> 01:54:54.387 region:rollup2
I HAD A SPANISH SPEAKING QUITE

01:54:53.053 --> 01:54:55.322 region:rollup2
RECENTLY GOING TO STILL CERTAIN

01:54:54.387 --> 01:54:56.656 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SERVICES AN OFFERING

01:54:55.322 --> 01:54:57.724 region:rollup2
INTERPRETER.

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:59.860 region:rollup2
THERE IT'S ALL JUST DEVELOP THE

01:54:57.724 --> 01:55:00.394 region:rollup2
PAPERWORK AND BRING IT BACK.

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:01.995 region:rollup2
THE CLIENTS THAT I DON'T

01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:02.796 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW TO FILL IT OUT I

01:55:01.995 --> 01:55:03.964 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE INTERPRETER.

01:55:02.796 --> 01:55:05.332 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TOLD WE DON'T HAVE AN

01:55:03.964 --> 01:55:07.434 region:rollup2
INTERPRETER SO YOU CAN JUST COME

01:55:05.332 --> 01:55:09.069 region:rollup2
BACK ANOTHER DAY.

01:55:07.434 --> 01:55:09.603 region:rollup2
SO FOR OTHER VERY THREE THIN

01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:11.037 region:rollup2
CLIENTS ARE ALSO DENIED

01:55:09.603 --> 01:55:13.073 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

01:55:11.037 --> 01:55:15.308 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ONCE THE COURT

01:55:13.073 --> 01:55:16.409 region:rollup2
MANDATES CHILD SUPPORT --

01:55:15.308 --> 01:55:17.611 region:rollup2
DECLINES LOSE THEIR BENEFITS

01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:18.545 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS SEEN AS AN

01:55:17.611 --> 01:55:20.247 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE --

01:55:18.545 --> 01:55:22.015 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF INCOME.

01:55:20.247 --> 01:55:23.450 region:rollup2
SO THEN THE CLIENT HAS TO RELY

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:24.651 region:rollup2
ON THEIR VIEWS HERE TO PAY THEIR

01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:26.253 region:rollup2
CHILD SUPPORT ON TIME OR IF AT

01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:27.220 region:rollup2
ALL.

01:55:26.253 --> 01:55:30.390 region:rollup2
WHICH THEN IS PERPETUATING THE

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:31.358 region:rollup2
CYCLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:32.292 region:rollup2
SO I SPENT A LOT OF TIME

01:55:31.358 --> 01:55:33.894 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS

01:55:32.292 --> 01:55:34.661 region:rollup2
LIKE BE PUT IN PLACE.

01:55:33.894 --> 01:55:35.762 region:rollup2
AND THAT COULD EASE SOME OF THE

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:37.898 region:rollup2
HARDSHIP FOR SURVIVORS THAT WE

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:39.332 region:rollup2
WORK WITH. FOR ONE PROVIDING

01:55:37.898 --> 01:55:40.033 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SERVICE WORKERS WITH MORE

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:42.035 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:42.969 region:rollup2
TRAININGS.

01:55:42.035 --> 01:55:44.438 region:rollup2
THIS WILL HELP THEM UNDERSTAND

01:55:42.969 --> 01:55:45.372 region:rollup2
THE SURVIVOR MORIN HAVE AN

01:55:44.438 --> 01:55:46.706 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THE CRIME

01:55:45.372 --> 01:55:48.675 region:rollup2
MAY BE RELUCTANT TO SHARE

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:50.710 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ARE WHY THE KIND IS

01:55:48.675 --> 01:55:52.412 region:rollup2
PRESENTING THE WAY THAT THEY DO.

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:54.181 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD HELP COUNTY WORKERS

01:55:52.412 --> 01:55:54.815 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE COMPASSIONATE AND

01:55:54.181 --> 01:55:56.716 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:55:54.815 --> 01:55:58.285 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS.

01:55:56.716 --> 01:56:00.053 region:rollup2
I WAS ON THE PHONE RECENTLY THIS

01:55:58.285 --> 01:56:00.720 region:rollup2
WEEK WITH --

01:56:00.053 --> 01:56:01.521 region:rollup2
WITH THE COUNTY WORKER AND WITH

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:03.490 region:rollup2
MY CLIENT.

01:56:01.521 --> 01:56:04.858 region:rollup2
IN MY CLIENT WAS ASKED TO TALK

01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:06.726 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ABUSE A LITTLE BIT

01:56:04.858 --> 01:56:08.061 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CRIME WAS

01:56:06.726 --> 01:56:09.396 region:rollup2
NERVOUS ABOUT SHARING THAT SHE

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:10.063 region:rollup2
WAS IN A SHELTER.

01:56:09.396 --> 01:56:12.732 region:rollup2
SO THE CLIMATE BEGAN TO CRY AND

01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:14.334 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS.

01:56:12.732 --> 01:56:16.336 region:rollup2
PLAYERS UP TOGETHER [inaudible]

01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:18.205 region:rollup2
SO.

01:56:16.336 --> 01:56:19.906 region:rollup2
IN MY EXPERIENCE.

01:56:18.205 --> 01:56:21.408 region:rollup2
THEIR SITUATIONS WHERE SOCIAL

01:56:19.906 --> 01:56:23.276 region:rollup2
WORKERS ARE NOT MADE AWARE OF

01:56:21.408 --> 01:56:24.978 region:rollup2
INTERNAL PROCESSES EXEMPTIONS

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:25.946 region:rollup2
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS.

01:56:24.978 --> 01:56:28.348 region:rollup2
THE INCONSISTENCY IS THE MOST

01:56:25.946 --> 01:56:29.416 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING. FOR INSTANCE THE

01:56:28.348 --> 01:56:30.884 region:rollup2
CLIENT HAD THEIR BENEFIT

01:56:29.416 --> 01:56:32.719 region:rollup2
SANCTION FOR NOT PARTICIPATING

01:56:30.884 --> 01:56:34.221 region:rollup2
THE WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM WHEN

01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:36.623 region:rollup2
IN FACT THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS FOR

01:56:34.221 --> 01:56:37.557 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS.

01:56:36.623 --> 01:56:39.292 region:rollup2
SOME CLIENTS ARE TONIGHT

01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:40.360 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY CATCH IT IN FOOD STAFF

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:41.428 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE TOLD ONCE

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.764 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:56:41.428 --> 01:56:46.499 region:rollup2
SHELTER BUT THEY DON'T QUALIFY.

01:56:44.764 --> 01:56:47.968 region:rollup2
CLIENTS DO NOT STAY WITH ONE

01:56:46.499 --> 01:56:49.569 region:rollup2
CASEWORKER THEREABOUTS TO DALY

AGAIN.

01:56:52.906 --> 01:56:55.308 region:rollup2
THEREFORE IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE

01:56:54.207 --> 01:56:57.410 region:rollup2
HAVE A UNIVERSAL FROM PROVIDING

01:56:55.308 --> 01:56:58.512 region:rollup2

01:57:04.117 --> 01:57:06.319 region:rollup2
THE OVERALL APPLICATION PROCESS

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:07.587 region:rollup2
COULD BE ALSO GREATLY

01:57:06.319 --> 01:57:08.922 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFIED.

01:57:07.587 --> 01:57:10.257 region:rollup2

01:57:34.114 --> 01:57:36.683 region:rollup2
ANOTHER SOLUTION COULD BE

01:57:35.081 --> 01:57:38.251 region:rollup2
EXTENDING SOCIAL SERVICES HOURS

01:57:36.683 --> 01:57:39.352 region:rollup2

01:58:12.686 --> 01:58:16.856 region:rollup2
HEARING CALIFRNIA A FAMILY FOR

01:58:14.321 --> 01:58:19.526 region:rollup2

01:58:16.856 --> 01:58:22.429 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:58:19.526 --> 01:58:23.530 region:rollup2
SO IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR IT

01:58:22.429 --> 01:58:25.131 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IF THEY

01:58:23.530 --> 01:58:26.733 region:rollup2

CERTAIN COUNTY POVERTY LIMITS IT

01:58:29.135 --> 01:58:30.837 region:rollup2
WOULD SOLUTION COULD BE

01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:32.072 region:rollup2
INCREASING WILL --

01:58:30.837 --> 01:58:33.239 region:rollup2
INCOME LEVEL TO REFLECT THE

01:58:32.072 --> 01:58:37.377 region:rollup2
REALITY OF THE COST OF LIVING IN

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:38.745 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:58:37.377 --> 01:58:40.046 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE INCOME LIMIT FOR

01:58:38.745 --> 01:58:41.815 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY WITH SUPPORT THOSE

01:58:40.046 --> 01:58:42.449 region:rollup2
WHO MAKE TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY BUT

01:58:41.815 --> 01:58:47.554 region:rollup2
NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THEIR BASIC

01:58:42.449 --> 01:58:49.122 region:rollup2
NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE MANY CLIENTS

01:58:47.554 --> 01:58:50.190 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DENIED SOME OF MY

01:58:49.122 --> 01:58:51.558 region:rollup2
CLIENTS HAVE BEEN DENIED BECAUSE

01:58:50.190 --> 01:58:52.993 region:rollup2
THEY EXCEED THE ELIGIBILITY

01:58:51.558 --> 01:58:54.628 region:rollup2
INCOME LIMIT I HAVE CLIENTS

01:58:52.993 --> 01:58:58.098 region:rollup2
BEING THE NIGHT FOR MAKING ONE

01:58:54.628 --> 01:58:59.299 region:rollup2
DOLLAR OVER THIS LIMIT AMOUNT.

01:58:58.098 --> 01:59:01.167 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS LIKE

01:58:59.299 --> 01:59:02.235 region:rollup2
CLIENTS WHO OWN CARS ARE OFTEN

01:59:01.167 --> 01:59:02.902 region:rollup2
AYE BECAUSE THE EXCEED THE ASSET

01:59:02.235 --> 01:59:04.237 region:rollup2
LIMIT.

01:59:02.902 --> 01:59:05.839 region:rollup2
CLIENTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:59:04.237 --> 01:59:06.740 region:rollup2

02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:53.960 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC STABILITY HAVE 70%

02:03:52.659 --> 02:03:55.461 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN SUCCESSFUL

02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:59.065 region:rollup2
SURVIVORSHIP.

02:03:55.461 --> 02:04:00.233 region:rollup2
THAT 70%.

02:03:59.065 --> 02:04:01.467 region:rollup2
WHAT I DISCOVERED WAS THAT

02:04:00.233 --> 02:04:02.802 region:rollup2
SAFETY FOR LOW INCOME SURVIVORS

02:04:01.467 --> 02:04:04.404 region:rollup2
WAS YOUR?

LEGAL FEES AND TIME SPENT

02:04:12.512 --> 02:04:17.050 region:rollup2
ACCESSING ADVOCACY AND SERVICES.

02:04:15.615 --> 02:04:17.617 region:rollup2
THESE ARE OFTEN HARD COSTS

02:04:17.050 --> 02:04:19.752 region:rollup2
INFLEXIBLE TO INCOME

02:04:17.617 --> 02:04:21.220 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS.

02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:23.056 region:rollup2
THEY REQUIRE SURVIVORS TO MAKE

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:24.023 region:rollup2
UNTENABLE CHOICES.

02:04:23.056 --> 02:04:26.693 region:rollup2
CHOICES BETWEEN VIOLENCE AND

02:04:24.023 --> 02:04:28.261 region:rollup2
POVERTY.

02:04:26.693 --> 02:04:29.896 region:rollup2
COMPOUNDING THESE EFFECTS

02:04:28.261 --> 02:04:32.699 region:rollup2
ABUSIVE PARTNERS YOU SYSTEMATIC

02:04:29.896 --> 02:04:34.300 region:rollup2
TACTICS OF CONTROL IN CORE XIN.

02:04:32.699 --> 02:04:36.035 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL ABUSERS EXPLOIT THEIR

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.970 region:rollup2
PARTNERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF

02:04:36.035 --> 02:04:39.105 region:rollup2
METHODS INCLUDING BUT NOT

02:04:36.970 --> 02:04:40.573 region:rollup2
LIMITED.

02:04:39.105 --> 02:04:41.641 region:rollup2
TO LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO

WORKER RETAINED EARNINGS

02:04:41.641 --> 02:04:44.844 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING CONTROL OF ALL

EMPLOYMENT.

02:04:48.548 --> 02:04:51.250 region:rollup2
MOST OFTEN THE ABUSER KEEPS

02:04:50.283 --> 02:04:52.585 region:rollup2
TIGHT CONTROLS ON THE

02:04:51.250 --> 02:04:53.786 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE TO THE

WELL BEING.

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:59.792 region:rollup2
HIDING ALL DATA ON DEBT SAVINGS

02:04:57.523 --> 02:05:01.394 region:rollup2
AND CREDIT STANDINGS.

02:04:59.792 --> 02:05:03.262 region:rollup2
THE ULTIMATE GOAL THOUGH IS

02:05:01.394 --> 02:05:05.932 region:rollup2
ALWAYS TO LIMIT THE AUTONOMY OF

02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:07.133 region:rollup2
THEIR PARTNER.

02:05:05.932 --> 02:05:08.468 region:rollup2
INTRIGUED BY THIS INFORMATION I

02:05:07.133 --> 02:05:09.502 region:rollup2
SOUGHT EDUCATION ON THE TOPIC

02:05:08.468 --> 02:05:11.804 region:rollup2
AND FOUND VERY FEW OPTIONS TO

02:05:09.502 --> 02:05:13.272 region:rollup2
LEARN MORE. ONE GROUP I FOUND

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:14.340 region:rollup2
WAS OUT OF WASHINGTON DC.

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:16.075 region:rollup2
THE CENTER FOR SURVIVORS AGENCY

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:17.143 region:rollup2
AND JUSTICE.

02:05:16.075 --> 02:05:18.978 region:rollup2
THEY HAD STARTED TO DEVELOP A

02:05:17.143 --> 02:05:19.946 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM WHICH TO THIS DAY HAS

02:05:18.978 --> 02:05:21.381 region:rollup2
PROVED TO BE THE MOST CUTTING

02:05:19.946 --> 02:05:22.215 region:rollup2
EDGE LIBRARY OF INFORMATION ON

02:05:21.381 --> 02:05:24.717 region:rollup2
THE TOPIC I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:05:22.215 --> 02:05:25.952 region:rollup2
FIND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

02:05:24.717 --> 02:05:27.687 region:rollup2
I LOOKED FOR RESOURCES WITHIN

02:05:25.952 --> 02:05:29.021 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:05:27.687 --> 02:05:30.490 region:rollup2
COMING UP NEARLY EMPTY HANDED WE

02:05:29.021 --> 02:05:31.691 region:rollup2
CREATED A FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT

02:05:30.490 --> 02:05:33.826 region:rollup2
CLASS THAT WE'VE.

02:05:31.691 --> 02:05:34.394 region:rollup2
IN THE CLASS WE EDUCATED PEOPLE

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:35.294 region:rollup2
ON THE BASICS OF CREDIT AND

02:05:34.394 --> 02:05:37.296 region:rollup2
BUDGETING.

02:05:35.294 --> 02:05:38.731 region:rollup2
HOW TO IDENTIFY ISSUES?

02:05:37.296 --> 02:05:40.233 region:rollup2
WHAT TO DO TO PROTECT ONESELF

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:41.701 region:rollup2
FROM IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD

02:05:40.233 --> 02:05:42.502 region:rollup2
AND HOW TO START THE SLOW PARTS

02:05:41.701 --> 02:05:44.637 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF REBUILDING THE

02:05:42.502 --> 02:05:46.105 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL PICTURE?

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:47.440 region:rollup2
WE BEGAN PULLING CREDIT THROUGH

02:05:46.105 --> 02:05:49.008 region:rollup2
THE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT DOT COM

02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:50.076 region:rollup2
SITE WHICH ALLOWS ALL AMERICANS

02:05:49.008 --> 02:05:51.844 region:rollup2
FREE ACCESS TO CREDIT REPORT

02:05:50.076 --> 02:05:52.345 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR.

02:05:51.844 --> 02:05:53.846 region:rollup2
AND FOUND THAT A LARGE

02:05:52.345 --> 02:05:55.181 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF ITS VICTIMS OF

02:05:53.846 --> 02:05:56.916 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COULDN'T GET

02:05:55.181 --> 02:05:58.117 region:rollup2
PAST THE BASIC SECURITY

02:05:56.916 --> 02:05:59.986 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS TO ACCESS CREDIT.

02:05:58.117 --> 02:06:01.721 region:rollup2
DUE TO FINANCIAL ABUSE.

02:05:59.986 --> 02:06:04.891 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE TO KNOW

02:06:01.721 --> 02:06:05.992 region:rollup2
YOUR CREDIT TO ACCESS TO CREDIT.

02:06:04.891 --> 02:06:07.293 region:rollup2
THAT BEING THE CASE WE SOUGHT

02:06:05.992 --> 02:06:08.795 region:rollup2
OUT A PORTAL FOR CREDIT REVIEW

02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:10.129 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ACCESS

02:06:08.795 --> 02:06:11.464 region:rollup2
CREDIT REPORTS WITHOUT THE

02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:12.532 region:rollup2
SECURITY QUESTIONS AND FOUND OUT

02:06:11.464 --> 02:06:13.866 region:rollup2
PLATFORM.

02:06:12.532 --> 02:06:14.934 region:rollup2
WITH TRANS UNION IN A PORTAL

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:16.002 region:rollup2
THEY'D BEEN USING FOR CHILDREN

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:17.870 region:rollup2
EATING AGING OUT OF THE FOSTER

02:06:16.002 --> 02:06:19.072 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:20.807 region:rollup2
WITH THE AID IT STATE CONTROLLER

02:06:19.072 --> 02:06:22.942 region:rollup2
WE ARE ABLE TO GET THEM TO GRANT

02:06:20.807 --> 02:06:24.143 region:rollup2
US ACCESS FOR WE'VE CLIENTS.

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:25.611 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE COULD HAVE ACCESS TO

02:06:24.143 --> 02:06:27.747 region:rollup2
REVIEW DISPUTE CREDIT ITEMS WITH

02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:29.215 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUAL.

02:06:27.747 --> 02:06:30.550 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ALSO GIVE A COPY OF THE

02:06:29.215 --> 02:06:31.751 region:rollup2
CREDIT REPORT TO THE CLIENT SO

02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:33.219 region:rollup2
THAT THEY COULD HAVE RECORD.

02:06:31.751 --> 02:06:35.488 region:rollup2
AND BEGIN THE LONG JOURNEY OF

02:06:33.219 --> 02:06:37.190 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE CREDIT ISSUE.

02:06:35.488 --> 02:06:38.558 region:rollup2
THIS MADE WE'VE THE FIRST AGENCY

02:06:37.190 --> 02:06:42.028 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTRY TO USE THIS FOR

02:06:38.558 --> 02:06:43.362 region:rollup2
VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

02:06:42.028 --> 02:06:44.831 region:rollup2
NOW YOU'LL PROBABLY BE MOST

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:45.331 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN IS THE ACTUAL WORK

02:06:44.831 --> 02:06:46.432 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN DOING WITH

02:06:45.331 --> 02:06:48.301 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

02:06:46.432 --> 02:06:50.570 region:rollup2
MOST LIKELY WHY WAS ASKED HERE

02:06:48.301 --> 02:06:52.271 region:rollup2
TODAY AS I AM IN A ELITE SLASH

02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:52.839 region:rollup2
SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO DO

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:54.407 region:rollup2
WHAT I DO IN THE SACRAMENTO

STATE.

02:06:56.442 --> 02:06:59.745 region:rollup2
OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS I'VE MET

02:06:58.144 --> 02:07:00.546 region:rollup2

02:06:59.745 --> 02:07:02.582 region:rollup2
WOMEN IN SACRAMENTO WHO HAVE

SUFFERED FINANCIAL ABUSE.

02:07:02.582 --> 02:07:04.984 region:rollup2
I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING FROM SIMPLE

MORTGAGES.

02:07:06.719 --> 02:07:09.522 region:rollup2
IDENTITY THEFT RESULTING IN

02:07:24.337 --> 02:07:26.839 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES THEY FIND THEY OWE

02:07:25.538 --> 02:07:28.474 region:rollup2

02:07:26.839 --> 02:07:29.942 region:rollup2
CAN'T GET A BANK ACCOUNT AND IF

THE SPOUSE PRESENT.

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:35.681 region:rollup2
SAME IS TRUE WITH MOST CREDIT

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:27.199 region:rollup2
WE SEE MULTIPLE STUDENT LOANS

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:29.869 region:rollup2
AND FALL AND MOST OFTEN THEY'RE

02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:30.803 region:rollup2
FORCED TO DROP OUT BY THE ABUSER

02:08:29.869 --> 02:08:33.206 region:rollup2

REPOSSESSED.

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:39.745 region:rollup2
IT'S A COMMON TACTIC OF ABUSER

02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:40.947 region:rollup2
TO DESTROY THE VICTIM'S CARS

02:08:39.745 --> 02:08:43.082 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T LEAVE AND IT'S FAIRLY

02:08:40.947 --> 02:08:43.983 region:rollup2
WELL KNOWN THAT A CAR IS SEEN BY

02:08:43.082 --> 02:08:45.351 region:rollup2
A VICTIM.

02:08:43.983 --> 02:08:45.985 region:rollup2
AS ITS INITIAL WAY OUT

02:08:45.351 --> 02:08:47.720 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN CHILDREN ARE

02:08:45.985 --> 02:08:48.821 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:50.289 region:rollup2
IF THE SURVIVOR HAS BEEN A

02:08:48.821 --> 02:08:52.024 region:rollup2
VICTIM OF TRAFFICKING WE ALSO

02:08:50.289 --> 02:08:53.492 region:rollup2
SEE MANY AUTO LEASES WITH EARLY

02:08:54.293 --> 02:08:57.363 region:rollup2

02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:03.029 region:rollup2
THEY MAY KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN

KICKED OUT OF AN APARTMENT.

02:10:03.029 --> 02:10:06.465 region:rollup2
BUT THEY MAY NOT KNOW THAT THEY

OWE THREE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND

02:10:06.465 --> 02:10:11.704 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO PASS LANDLORDS.

02:10:09.435 --> 02:10:13.172 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW THEY'RE LEFT WITH ONLY

THE MONEY THEIR POCKET IF ANY.

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:15.708 region:rollup2

BANKRUPTCY IS THE ONLY WAY OUT

02:10:15.708 --> 02:10:19.178 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS IT

02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:20.646 region:rollup2
BANKRUPTCIES COST MONEY.

02:10:19.178 --> 02:10:23.015 region:rollup2

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:25.851 region:rollup2
UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN TIPPED OFF BY

02:10:26.919 --> 02:10:29.322 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY THE FIRST TIME THE

02:10:29.322 --> 02:10:32.258 region:rollup2
OF THE FINANCIAL ABUSE.

02:10:31.023 --> 02:10:33.726 region:rollup2

02:19:35.467 --> 02:19:39.204 region:rollup2
AS A CHILD.

02:19:37.069 --> 02:19:40.939 region:rollup2
MY FATHER A SUFFERED GREATLY

02:19:39.204 --> 02:19:43.475 region:rollup2

02:19:40.939 --> 02:19:44.643 region:rollup2
POST STRESS DISORDER THAT HE

02:19:43.475 --> 02:19:46.278 region:rollup2
OBTAINED WHILE HE WAS A SOLDIER

02:19:44.643 --> 02:19:48.413 region:rollup2
IN VIETNAM.

02:19:46.278 --> 02:19:50.415 region:rollup2
AND HE DIDN'T RECEIVE AT ANY

02:19:48.413 --> 02:19:51.216 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE

02:19:50.415 --> 02:19:53.352 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:55.354 region:rollup2
THESE WEREN'T WIDELY AVAILABLE

02:19:53.352 --> 02:19:57.623 region:rollup2
FOR VICTIMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC

02:19:55.354 --> 02:20:00.292 region:rollup2

WERE TOLD THAT IT DIDN'T EXIST

02:20:00.292 --> 02:20:05.330 region:rollup2
AND AND HE WAS SPIT ON BY PEOPLE

02:20:03.629 --> 02:20:07.499 region:rollup2
IN HIS COMMUNITY AND AND MY

02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:09.735 region:rollup2
BROTHER FAMILY --

02:20:07.499 --> 02:20:11.103 region:rollup2
SO HE AND HE SUFFERED GREATLY

02:20:09.735 --> 02:20:12.170 region:rollup2
FROM THAT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW

02:20:11.103 --> 02:20:14.306 region:rollup2
IF HE WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN

02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:14.973 region:rollup2
ABUSIVE HAD YOU NOT HAD PTSD

02:20:14.306 --> 02:20:16.708 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I NEVER KNEW HIM WITHOUT

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:18.010 region:rollup2
PTSD.

02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:19.378 region:rollup2
DID ABUSE THAT WE HAD IN OUR

02:20:18.010 --> 02:20:22.147 region:rollup2
FAMILY -- IT

02:20:19.378 --> 02:20:24.683 region:rollup2
WAS VERY CYCLICAL EVERY WEEKEND

02:20:22.147 --> 02:20:27.386 region:rollup2
THERE WAS SELF MEDICATION ABUSE

02:20:24.683 --> 02:20:29.655 region:rollup2

AND CONTROL.

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:37.129 region:rollup2
AND FOR US AS CHILDREN WHAT IT

02:20:35.661 --> 02:20:38.297 region:rollup2
MEANT IS THAT WE HAD A LOT ON

02:20:37.129 --> 02:20:40.065 region:rollup2
THE WEEKENDS WE HEAD IN THE

LODI.

02:21:04.756 --> 02:21:08.894 region:rollup2
AND I REMEMBER IT REALLY FUNNY

02:21:06.358 --> 02:21:10.362 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS A WEEK OF OF JOY

02:21:08.894 --> 02:21:15.934 region:rollup2
ELATION [inaudible]

02:21:10.362 --> 02:21:17.836 region:rollup2
PLAY FUN ON AND A WE DIDN'T

02:21:15.934 --> 02:21:19.438 region:rollup2
WORRY ABOUT THINGS.

02:21:17.836 --> 02:21:21.006 region:rollup2
IT WAS SUMMER WE HAD WATER

02:21:19.438 --> 02:21:21.306 region:rollup2
BALLOON FIGHTS AT THE OTHER KIDS

02:21:21.006 --> 02:21:23.842 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:21:21.306 --> 02:21:25.978 region:rollup2
AND THE WAS A GOAT WHO LIVED IN

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:27.846 region:rollup2
A MOBILE HOME PARK AND HE WOULD

02:21:25.978 --> 02:21:29.448 region:rollup2
COME INTO OUR HOME.

02:21:27.846 --> 02:21:30.916 region:rollup2
AND LIKE CASES AROUND THE HOME

02:21:29.448 --> 02:21:33.185 region:rollup2
IN THE MOBILE HOME.

02:21:30.916 --> 02:21:33.819 region:rollup2
IT WAS A REALLY GREAT MEMORY.

02:21:33.185 --> 02:21:35.987 region:rollup2
A LOSS OF I REMEMBER NOT BEING

02:21:33.819 --> 02:21:37.055 region:rollup2
AFRAID.

02:21:35.987 --> 02:21:38.890 region:rollup2
WHEN THE WEEK WAS OVER WE WENT

02:21:37.055 --> 02:21:39.992 region:rollup2
BACK?

02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:40.625 region:rollup2
AND MY SISTER AND I STOOD SAT IN

02:21:39.992 --> 02:21:43.462 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:21:40.625 --> 02:21:45.864 region:rollup2
IN THE END.

02:21:43.462 --> 02:21:48.633 region:rollup2
IN THE STATION WAGON.

02:21:45.864 --> 02:21:50.002 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULDN'T LEAVE.

02:21:48.633 --> 02:21:50.302 region:rollup2
AND IT GOT DARK AND WILL CRY

02:21:50.002 --> 02:21:53.205 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:21:50.302 --> 02:21:56.007 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY MY DAD CAME OUT.

02:21:53.205 --> 02:21:57.209 region:rollup2
AND PULL THE SAID.

02:21:56.007 --> 02:21:59.344 region:rollup2
AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON I MEAN

02:21:57.209 --> 02:22:00.379 region:rollup2
WE NEVER REALLY HAD A CLOSE

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:02.247 region:rollup2
TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP WITH MY

02:22:00.379 --> 02:22:04.549 region:rollup2
FATHER OBVIOUSLY.

02:22:02.247 --> 02:22:05.083 region:rollup2
ON BUT WE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE A

02:22:04.549 --> 02:22:06.685 region:rollup2
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY

02:22:05.083 --> 02:22:07.886 region:rollup2
MOTHER.

02:22:06.685 --> 02:22:09.888 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WERE ANGRY AT HER FOR

02:22:07.886 --> 02:22:10.922 region:rollup2
BRINGING US BACK.

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:12.124 region:rollup2
I WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE

02:22:10.922 --> 02:22:15.227 region:rollup2
WOULD DO THAT.

02:22:12.124 --> 02:22:16.695 region:rollup2
MY SISTER ESPECIALLY.

02:22:15.227 --> 02:22:18.030 region:rollup2
AND FROM THERE THINGS DIDN'T GET

02:22:16.695 --> 02:22:19.731 region:rollup2
BETTER.

02:22:18.030 --> 02:22:20.966 region:rollup2
EVERY TIME THAT MY MOTHER WOULD

02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:22.033 region:rollup2
COME TO THE POINT OF WANTING TO

02:22:20.966 --> 02:22:24.002 region:rollup2
LEAVE MY FATHER WOULD SAY

02:22:22.033 --> 02:22:26.004 region:rollup2
REMEMBER WHEN YOU LEFT.

02:22:24.002 --> 02:22:26.638 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAME BACK.

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:28.840 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT ON

02:22:26.638 --> 02:22:30.575 region:rollup2
YOUR OWN.

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:32.811 region:rollup2
WHEN I GOT OLDER I ASKED MY MOM

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:33.912 region:rollup2
WHY DID YOU GO BACK?

02:22:32.811 --> 02:22:36.048 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ASKED ALL THE TIME TO

02:22:33.912 --> 02:22:37.649 region:rollup2
LEAD.

02:22:36.048 --> 02:22:40.719 region:rollup2
AND SHE SAID WE HAD NO MONEY.

02:22:37.649 --> 02:22:42.587 region:rollup2
WE RAN OUT OF MONEY.

02:22:40.719 --> 02:22:44.723 region:rollup2
MY FATHER CONTINUED TO TOOK

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:46.725 region:rollup2
CONTROL IN OUR LIVES

02:22:44.723 --> 02:22:48.026 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY AS WELL.

02:22:46.725 --> 02:22:49.094 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY HE DID THAT WAS HE

02:22:48.026 --> 02:22:49.394 region:rollup2
PREVENTED MY MOTHER FROM GETTING

02:22:49.094 --> 02:22:52.064 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:22:49.394 --> 02:22:52.864 region:rollup2
CHILD CARE.

02:22:52.064 --> 02:22:53.799 region:rollup2
SHE WASN'T ABLE TO GET CHILD

02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:55.801 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:22:53.799 --> 02:22:57.269 region:rollup2
THAN HER GOING TO TO WORK ON

02:22:55.801 --> 02:22:58.970 region:rollup2
WHERE SHE WORKED AT CHEVRON.

02:22:57.269 --> 02:23:00.872 region:rollup2
IN THE MAIL ROOM.

02:22:58.970 --> 02:23:03.008 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH TO PAY.

02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:04.876 region:rollup2
FOR THE COST OF CHILDCARE SO HE

02:23:03.008 --> 02:23:06.445 region:rollup2
REFUSED THE TO PROVIDE ANY

02:23:04.876 --> 02:23:07.279 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE AMOUNT OF CHILD

02:23:06.445 --> 02:23:08.346 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:23:07.279 --> 02:23:10.182 region:rollup2
AND SHE COULDN'T AFFORD TO KEEP

02:23:08.346 --> 02:23:11.817 region:rollup2
US IN CHILD CARE.

02:23:10.182 --> 02:23:13.251 region:rollup2
I'M EACH TIME SHE WOULD TRY TO

02:23:11.817 --> 02:23:14.086 region:rollup2
GET A JOB IN ENOUGH MONEY TO

02:23:13.251 --> 02:23:17.289 region:rollup2
ESCAPE [inaudible]

02:23:14.086 --> 02:23:18.223 region:rollup2
ON YOU NOTE SHE'D HAVE TO FIGURE

02:23:17.289 --> 02:23:19.424 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO ALSO KEEP US IN CHILD

02:23:18.223 --> 02:23:20.358 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:21.560 region:rollup2
I WOULDN'T WHEN SCHOOL WASN'T

02:23:20.358 --> 02:23:25.030 region:rollup2

02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:25.664 region:rollup2
ON AND AS A RESULT WE FOR THE

02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:27.165 region:rollup2
MOST PART DIDN'T HAVE CHILD

02:23:25.664 --> 02:23:28.500 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:23:27.165 --> 02:23:30.102 region:rollup2
WE WERE IN THE LEFT AT PEOPLE'S

02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:31.570 region:rollup2

WE DIDN'T REPORT.

02:23:36.608 --> 02:23:38.910 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID THAT IT

02:23:38.110 --> 02:23:39.978 region:rollup2
WOULD COST MONEY TO GO THE

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:45.150 region:rollup2

02:25:24.449 --> 02:25:27.219 region:rollup2
TO AND THIS IS A NEW POLICY AS

02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:29.387 region:rollup2
WELL AND ONE THAT AYE WE ARE

02:25:27.219 --> 02:25:29.988 region:rollup2
UNIQUELY DOING IN CALIFORNIA I

02:25:29.387 --> 02:25:32.324 region:rollup2
THINK OTHER STATES CAN BENEFIT

02:25:29.988 --> 02:25:34.426 region:rollup2
FROM.

02:25:32.324 --> 02:25:35.794 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T

02:25:34.426 --> 02:25:37.028 region:rollup2
THAT PUT THESE TWO TOGETHER BUT

02:25:35.794 --> 02:25:38.763 region:rollup2
FOR US AT LEGAL SERVICES THEY

02:25:37.028 --> 02:25:40.832 region:rollup2
WERE VERY MUCH CONNECTED WE

02:25:38.763 --> 02:25:42.567 region:rollup2
REPEALED THE FAMILY CAP.

02:25:40.832 --> 02:25:43.568 region:rollup2
THE MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT PROGRAM

02:25:42.567 --> 02:25:45.837 region:rollup2
UP IN THE NEXT MONTH AND THE

02:25:43.568 --> 02:25:48.406 region:rollup2
GRANT OF RULE IN OUR CAL ARTS

02:25:45.837 --> 02:25:50.242 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE HAD A A RULE HERE IN

02:25:48.406 --> 02:25:51.776 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT DENIED AID TO A

02:25:50.242 --> 02:25:54.312 region:rollup2
CHILD WHO WAS BORN.

02:25:51.776 --> 02:25:57.082 region:rollup2
INTO A CAL WORKS HOUSEHOLD AND

02:25:54.312 --> 02:26:00.485 region:rollup2
AN A COUNTLESS NUMBER OF OF

02:25:57.082 --> 02:26:02.254 region:rollup2
PARENTS OF MOTHERS AT WORK WERE

02:26:00.485 --> 02:26:03.421 region:rollup2
DENIED AID FOR CHILDREN THAT

02:26:02.254 --> 02:26:05.323 region:rollup2
THEY CONCEIVED AS A RESULT OF

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:06.958 region:rollup2
ABUSE.

02:26:05.323 --> 02:26:08.760 region:rollup2
A BUT WE WE DIDN'T HEAR A LOT

02:26:06.958 --> 02:26:11.730 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT TODAY ON THE PANEL BUT

02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:13.632 region:rollup2
REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IS ALSO A

02:26:11.730 --> 02:26:15.800 region:rollup2
FORM OF ABUSE THAT MANY A WOMEN

02:26:13.632 --> 02:26:18.937 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:20.672 region:rollup2
AND WHERE THEY ARE DENIED A AS

02:26:18.937 --> 02:26:24.209 region:rollup2
YOU NOTE SERVICES EITHER

02:26:20.672 --> 02:26:26.244 region:rollup2
ABORTION SERVICES OR AND A

02:26:24.209 --> 02:26:28.680 region:rollup2
PREGNANCY PREVENTION SERVICES.

02:26:26.244 --> 02:26:31.216 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO HAD A YOU KNOW

02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:34.152 region:rollup2
SPOUSES THAT WERE RAPED BY THEIR

02:26:31.216 --> 02:26:35.720 region:rollup2
SPOUSE OR RAPES BY AT AND A

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:37.989 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO LIVE WITH THEM.

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:39.658 region:rollup2
AND I IF THEY WERE RAPED THE

02:26:37.989 --> 02:26:41.092 region:rollup2
CHILD IF THE IF THE CHILD WAS

02:26:39.658 --> 02:26:42.727 region:rollup2
CONCEIVED AS RAPE IN THE PRIOR

02:26:41.092 --> 02:26:44.296 region:rollup2
RULE THAT THAT FAMILY COULD GET

02:26:42.727 --> 02:26:45.297 region:rollup2
AID FOR THE CHILD.

02:26:44.296 --> 02:26:46.264 region:rollup2
BUT IF THEY WERE A VICTIM OF

02:26:45.297 --> 02:26:48.466 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC ABUSE.

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:50.669 region:rollup2
THEY COULD NOT.

02:26:48.466 --> 02:26:52.804 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT LINE WAS A WITH BILL

02:26:50.669 --> 02:26:55.573 region:rollup2
IS NOT THAT IT WAS A VERY THIN

02:26:52.804 --> 02:26:55.774 region:rollup2
LINE AND AND OFTENTIMES PEOPLE

02:26:55.573 --> 02:26:57.142 region:rollup2
WOULD.

02:26:55.774 --> 02:26:58.476 region:rollup2
NOT RECEIVE AID.

02:26:57.142 --> 02:27:01.913 region:rollup2
A FOR A CHILD THAT THEY AT

02:26:58.476 --> 02:27:02.714 region:rollup2
CONCEIVED THROUGH ABUSE.

02:27:01.913 --> 02:27:05.483 region:rollup2
THAT RULE HAS BEEN REPEALED AND

02:27:02.714 --> 02:27:06.685 region:rollup2
IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

02:27:05.483 --> 02:27:08.219 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS MAKING A DIFFERENCE

02:27:06.685 --> 02:27:10.188 region:rollup2
THAT WE AT THE HAVE RECENTLY

02:27:08.219 --> 02:27:11.156 region:rollup2
BEEN PASSED I'M EXCITED ABOUT A

02:27:10.188 --> 02:27:12.657 region:rollup2
THE GRAND INCREASES I THINK WILL

02:27:11.156 --> 02:27:14.959 region:rollup2
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

02:27:12.657 --> 02:27:15.493 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE IN THE DATA FROM

02:27:14.959 --> 02:27:16.027 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE TO EIGHTY FIVE

02:27:15.493 --> 02:27:17.228 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR THE TEMPORARY

02:27:16.027 --> 02:27:18.730 region:rollup2
SHELTER IS GOING TO MAKE A

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:20.198 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE HOME VISITING THE

02:27:18.730 --> 02:27:21.700 region:rollup2
JUST PETS HOPEFULLY WILL BE

02:27:20.198 --> 02:27:22.500 region:rollup2
SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE

02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:24.302 region:rollup2
BUDGET --

02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:25.804 region:rollup2
SOON CREATING A NEW PROGRAM SO

02:27:24.302 --> 02:27:26.905 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

02:27:25.804 --> 02:27:29.441 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WHEN THEY

02:27:26.905 --> 02:27:30.909 region:rollup2
HAVE WHEN THEY'RE PREGNANT AND

02:27:29.441 --> 02:27:32.444 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A SMALL CHILD.

02:27:30.909 --> 02:27:35.714 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS

02:27:32.444 --> 02:27:36.181 region:rollup2
BUT AND DOMESTIC ABUSE IS OFTEN

02:27:35.714 --> 02:27:38.850 region:rollup2
ONSET AT THE MOMENT OF

02:27:36.181 --> 02:27:40.752 region:rollup2
PREGNANCY.

02:27:38.850 --> 02:27:43.655 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE ENTRY

02:27:40.752 --> 02:27:45.156 region:rollup2
PLACES FOR ABUSE AND SO THE FACT

02:27:43.655 --> 02:27:47.225 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO NOW HAVE

02:27:45.156 --> 02:27:48.360 region:rollup2
SOCIAL WORKERS AVAILABLE TO LOW

02:27:47.225 --> 02:27:50.562 region:rollup2
INCOME PARENTS --

02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:51.096 region:rollup2
WHO ARE PREGNANT --

02:27:50.562 --> 02:27:53.231 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:27:51.096 --> 02:27:55.266 region:rollup2
PREGNANT.

02:27:53.231 --> 02:27:57.502 region:rollup2
THAT WILL AND WE HOPE THAT CAN

02:27:55.266 --> 02:27:59.337 region:rollup2
BE A PLACE ANON RAMP FOR

02:27:57.502 --> 02:28:00.839 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC ABUSE SERVICES AT A

02:27:59.337 --> 02:28:02.874 region:rollup2
MOMENT WHERE WE SEE AN UPTICK

02:28:00.839 --> 02:28:04.175 region:rollup2
AND DOMESTIC ABUSE.

02:28:02.874 --> 02:28:05.243 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT

02:28:04.175 --> 02:28:07.679 region:rollup2
THIS WAY BUT WE DO BECAUSE WE

02:28:05.243 --> 02:28:10.081 region:rollup2
SEE CLIENTS SSI CASH OUT.

02:28:07.679 --> 02:28:12.050 region:rollup2
AS I CASH SO A ENDING THE BAN

02:28:10.081 --> 02:28:15.420 region:rollup2
FOR CALPERS FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:28:12.050 --> 02:28:17.722 region:rollup2
RECEIVE CAP AT CAT SSI WILL HELP

02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:19.090 region:rollup2
THEM SECURE AND PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:28:17.722 --> 02:28:20.492 region:rollup2
ELDERLY OR DISABLED.

02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:22.093 region:rollup2
AND LIVE ALONE THEY'LL NOW BE

02:28:20.492 --> 02:28:23.928 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET AT CAL FRESH WHEN

02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:25.697 region:rollup2
THEY HAVEN'T BEFORE MAKING THEM

02:28:23.928 --> 02:28:28.333 region:rollup2
MORE AND INDEPENDENT AND MORE.

02:28:25.697 --> 02:28:30.268 region:rollup2
LIKELY A TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE.

02:28:28.333 --> 02:28:32.504 region:rollup2
ON A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE RELY ON

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:33.471 region:rollup2
SSI BECAUSE THEIR WAGES HAVE

02:28:32.504 --> 02:28:35.707 region:rollup2
BEEN SUPPRESSED THROUGHOUT THEIR

02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:37.776 region:rollup2
EARNINGS THEIR YEARS OF EARNINGS

02:28:35.707 --> 02:28:39.444 region:rollup2
AND SO VICTIMS OF THE DEMANDS OF

02:28:37.776 --> 02:28:40.945 region:rollup2
OF ABUSE SURVIVORS OF ABUSE.

02:28:39.444 --> 02:28:42.313 region:rollup2
AND OF HAVING LOWER EARNINGS

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:44.649 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIME MORE

02:28:42.313 --> 02:28:47.919 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO RELY ON SSI WHEN THEY

02:28:44.649 --> 02:28:51.556 region:rollup2
GET OLDER SO THAT A THAT THE

02:28:47.919 --> 02:28:52.357 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN POLICY PREDICT. FOR

02:28:51.556 --> 02:28:52.991 region:rollup2
OLDER.

02:28:52.357 --> 02:28:55.226 region:rollup2
VICTIMS OF ABUSE AND SURVIVORS

02:28:52.991 --> 02:28:57.495 region:rollup2
OF ABUSE.

02:28:55.226 --> 02:28:58.263 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN WE DO MOVING FORWARD?

02:28:57.495 --> 02:28:59.564 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

02:28:58.263 --> 02:29:01.032 region:rollup2
BEEN ASKING FOR AND I KNOW THAT

02:28:59.564 --> 02:29:02.267 region:rollup2
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLY ON IN

02:29:01.032 --> 02:29:03.601 region:rollup2
THE IN THE LEGISLATIVE YEAR WITH

02:29:02.267 --> 02:29:05.303 region:rollup2
YOUR BILL LAST YEAR.

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:08.506 region:rollup2
IS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

02:29:05.303 --> 02:29:11.776 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS FROM WELFARE TO WORK.

02:29:08.506 --> 02:29:14.579 region:rollup2
BEYOND JUST WHEN THE PERSON.

02:29:11.776 --> 02:29:15.613 region:rollup2
IS UNABLE TO WORK DUE TO A

02:29:14.579 --> 02:29:17.582 region:rollup2
DIRECT LINK TO THE DOMESTIC

02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:19.918 region:rollup2
ABUSE.

02:29:17.582 --> 02:29:21.152 region:rollup2
AND WHEN SOMEBODY APPLIES TO

02:29:19.918 --> 02:29:22.654 region:rollup2
HAVE A WAIVER FROM THE WELFARE

02:29:21.152 --> 02:29:24.589 region:rollup2
TO WORK RULE IN CALIFORNIA THEY

02:29:22.654 --> 02:29:25.156 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SHOW THAT SOMEHOW THERE

02:29:24.589 --> 02:29:27.425 region:rollup2
DID THEIR ABUSE IS DIRECTLY

02:29:25.156 --> 02:29:29.494 region:rollup2
LINKED. TO THEIR INABILITY TO

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:31.129 region:rollup2
WORK -- BUT

02:29:29.494 --> 02:29:33.932 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES A CONNECTION IS NOT AS

02:29:31.129 --> 02:29:35.400 region:rollup2
CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE PEOPLE

02:29:33.932 --> 02:29:36.601 region:rollup2
WHO STILL HAVE TO LIVE IN THE

02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:37.969 region:rollup2
SAME NEIGHBORHOODS AS A PERSON

02:29:36.601 --> 02:29:39.838 region:rollup2
WHO HAS ABUSE THEM.

02:29:37.969 --> 02:29:41.539 region:rollup2
AND LEAVING BACK AND FORTH TO

02:29:39.838 --> 02:29:43.708 region:rollup2
WORK HAVING A* A AND A VERY

02:29:41.539 --> 02:29:45.210 region:rollup2
VISIBLE PATTERN OF TRAVEL

02:29:43.708 --> 02:29:46.911 region:rollup2
TRANSPORT FROM YOU KNOW IN

02:29:45.210 --> 02:29:48.646 region:rollup2
PUBLIC TRANSIT FROM FROM THEIR

02:29:46.911 --> 02:29:50.114 region:rollup2
HOME TO THEIR WORK PUTS THEM IN

02:29:48.646 --> 02:29:52.450 region:rollup2
DANGER.

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:54.252 region:rollup2
ALSO IM WHEN YOU ARE SURVIVING

02:29:52.450 --> 02:29:56.688 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC ABUSE.

02:29:54.252 --> 02:29:58.256 region:rollup2
YOU ARE IN A A A PLACE MENTALLY

02:29:56.688 --> 02:30:00.425 region:rollup2
WITH THE OR AND MENTAL HEALTH

02:29:58.256 --> 02:30:01.326 region:rollup2
RECOVERY AND WITH YOUR SPIRITUAL

02:30:00.425 --> 02:30:03.027 region:rollup2
RECOVERY SOMETIMES OF THE

02:30:01.326 --> 02:30:03.995 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL RECOVERY WHERE THE

02:30:03.027 --> 02:30:05.730 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR

02:30:03.995 --> 02:30:08.266 region:rollup2
INABILITY TO WORK.

02:30:05.730 --> 02:30:09.601 region:rollup2
ON AND THE ABUSE IS SOMETIMES

02:30:08.266 --> 02:30:12.971 region:rollup2
NOT AVAILABLE AND VISIBLE TO

02:30:09.601 --> 02:30:13.605 region:rollup2
OTHERS SOMETIMES YOU'RE STILL.

02:30:12.971 --> 02:30:15.340 region:rollup2
COTTON CONNECTING THE DOTS

02:30:13.605 --> 02:30:18.009 region:rollup2
YOURSELF.

02:30:15.340 --> 02:30:19.377 region:rollup2
ON AND SO BEING FORCED TO

02:30:18.009 --> 02:30:21.613 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN SOMETHING YOU'RE STILL

02:30:19.377 --> 02:30:23.214 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN ORDER TO

02:30:21.613 --> 02:30:24.983 region:rollup2
HAVE THE SPACE AS YOU SAY IF I

02:30:23.214 --> 02:30:26.284 region:rollup2
REMEMBER COOLEY --

02:30:24.983 --> 02:30:28.119 region:rollup2
TO GET THROUGH THE ABUSE AND

02:30:26.284 --> 02:30:29.621 region:rollup2
SURVIVED THE ABUSE AND I THINK

02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:31.222 region:rollup2
IS REALLY UNFAIR.

02:30:29.621 --> 02:30:33.358 region:rollup2
AND AN AND THE OTHER PIECE OF

02:30:31.222 --> 02:30:35.226 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT WE WE ALSO.

02:30:33.358 --> 02:30:36.995 region:rollup2
WHEN SOMEBODY DOES FINALLY

02:30:35.226 --> 02:30:38.162 region:rollup2
DISCLOSE A THAT MAYBE THEY THEY

02:30:36.995 --> 02:30:39.430 region:rollup2
ARE IN A TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP

02:30:38.162 --> 02:30:40.064 region:rollup2
NOW WITH THEIR WORKER AND

02:30:39.430 --> 02:30:42.700 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DISCLOSING THE DOMESTIC

02:30:40.064 --> 02:30:43.501 region:rollup2
ABUSE -- AT

02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.969 region:rollup2
THE END AND THEY DISCLOSE THAT

02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:48.039 region:rollup2
HAPPENED PRIOR [inaudible]

02:30:44.969 --> 02:30:50.441 region:rollup2
AND THEY AND THEIR NOT ABLE TO

02:30:48.039 --> 02:30:52.677 region:rollup2
GO BACK AND RECAPTURE THOSE

02:30:50.441 --> 02:30:53.311 region:rollup2
THOSE YEARS AND MONTHS OF

02:30:52.677 --> 02:30:55.079 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT TRAINING

02:30:53.311 --> 02:30:56.681 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES AND MAKE THE MOST

02:30:55.079 --> 02:30:58.449 region:rollup2
OF THEM WE'VE ASKED FOR SOME ON

02:30:56.681 --> 02:30:59.083 region:rollup2
TAKE THE ABILITY TO AND TAKE

02:30:58.449 --> 02:31:00.852 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE.

02:30:59.083 --> 02:31:02.353 region:rollup2
MONTHS AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE

02:31:00.852 --> 02:31:04.155 region:rollup2
BEEN COMPLYING WITH THE WELFARE

02:31:02.353 --> 02:31:04.422 region:rollup2
TO WORK REQUIREMENT BY DOING

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:08.559 region:rollup2
WORK FARE.

02:31:04.422 --> 02:31:10.461 region:rollup2
ON BUT YOU'RE JUST GETTING BY

02:31:08.559 --> 02:31:11.996 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO SURVIVE AND BE

02:31:10.461 --> 02:31:13.798 region:rollup2
AND SURVIVING IS NOT THE SAME AS

02:31:11.996 --> 02:31:14.933 region:rollup2
DRIVING IT'S NOT AN OPPORTUNITY

02:31:13.798 --> 02:31:16.568 region:rollup2
OF WORK.

02:31:14.933 --> 02:31:18.202 region:rollup2

THE WAY WE ENGAGE WITH

02:55:44.634 --> 02:55:46.603 region:rollup2
RECIPIENTS NOT JUST RECIPIENTS

02:55:46.069 --> 02:55:47.937 region:rollup2

ABUSE.

02:55:47.937 --> 02:55:50.774 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT HAS IT HAS A

02:55:49.172 --> 02:55:52.475 region:rollup2
LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR THOSE

02:55:50.774 --> 02:55:54.043 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS RATHER THAN JUST

02:55:52.475 --> 02:55:55.512 region:rollup2

HOURS A WEEK IT COULD BE A SMALL

02:56:39.322 --> 02:56:41.858 region:rollup2
STEP AND THAT'S A POSITIVE AS

02:56:41.491 --> 02:56:43.893 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:56:41.858 --> 02:56:44.427 region:rollup2

EXPERIENCES AND THAT PROCESS IS

02:57:11.221 --> 02:57:13.456 region:rollup2
UNDER WAY WE HAVE

02:57:12.121 --> 02:57:14.624 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES ON THE GROUP OUR

02:57:13.456 --> 02:57:16.259 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON THE GROUP

02:57:14.624 --> 02:57:16.693 region:rollup2

MOON TO BE HAVING THIS

02:57:20.463 --> 02:57:23.132 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION SO WE THINK THAT

02:57:21.764 --> 02:57:24.300 region:rollup2
DOES HOLD A LOT OF PROMISE.

02:57:23.132 --> 02:57:26.269 region:rollup2
AND THEN THINKING THOUGH HOW DO

02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:26.803 region:rollup2
WE CONNECT THAT TO CAL WORKS HOW

02:57:26.269 --> 02:57:28.238 region:rollup2
DO WE INCLUDE THAT IN THE

02:57:26.803 --> 02:57:29.472 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS SEEMS REALLY

02:57:28.238 --> 02:57:31.074 region:rollup2
CRITICAL AND WOULD BE AN

02:57:29.472 --> 02:57:32.575 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:57:31.074 --> 02:57:33.877 region:rollup2
WE FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THAT

02:57:32.575 --> 02:57:35.378 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

02:57:33.877 --> 02:57:36.279 region:rollup2
AND NOT JUST THE CHILD WELFARE

02:57:35.378 --> 02:57:37.614 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WE'VE BEEN KIND OF

02:57:36.279 --> 02:57:39.082 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT IT BUT IN A

02:57:37.614 --> 02:57:40.416 region:rollup2
BROADER WAY AND THEN FINALLY

02:57:39.082 --> 02:57:41.751 region:rollup2
JUST A COMMENT ABOUT THE HOUSING

02:57:40.416 --> 02:57:43.219 region:rollup2
AND HOMELESSNESS WHICH IN

02:57:41.751 --> 02:57:44.420 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO A QUESTION I THINK

02:57:43.219 --> 02:57:45.755 region:rollup2

I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO

02:57:54.831 --> 02:57:58.101 region:rollup2
THAT AND PARTICULARLY TO

02:57:55.732 --> 02:58:00.270 region:rollup2
EVICTION I THINK IT CAME UP AS A

02:57:58.101 --> 02:58:00.470 region:rollup2
THEME ON A FEW OF THE PANELS

02:58:00.270 --> 02:58:01.671 region:rollup2
TODAY.

02:58:00.470 --> 02:58:02.639 region:rollup2
THE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT

02:58:01.671 --> 02:58:03.773 region:rollup2
ADDICTION IN RECENT YEARS

02:58:02.639 --> 02:58:05.675 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR THE WORK OF

02:58:03.773 --> 02:58:08.578 region:rollup2
MATTHEW DESMOND ON WHO WROTE THE

02:58:05.675 --> 02:58:10.213 region:rollup2
BOOK CALLED EVICTED AND RUNS THE

02:58:08.578 --> 02:58:11.814 region:rollup2
VIXEN LAB IS THAT.

02:58:10.213 --> 02:58:13.950 region:rollup2
ARE SURPRISINGLY A VIXEN

02:58:11.814 --> 02:58:16.085 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IS ARM.

02:58:13.950 --> 02:58:17.687 region:rollup2
A PRECURSOR TO LOSING YOUR JOB

02:58:16.085 --> 02:58:18.488 region:rollup2
LOSING YOUR JOB DOESN'T HAPPEN

02:58:17.687 --> 02:58:19.556 region:rollup2
GENERALLY AND THEN YOU GET

02:58:18.488 --> 02:58:20.723 region:rollup2
EVICTED YOU GET ADDICTED AND

02:58:19.556 --> 02:58:22.725 region:rollup2
THEN YOU HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE.

02:58:20.723 --> 02:58:24.861 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU LOSE YOUR JOB IT

02:58:22.725 --> 02:58:27.263 region:rollup2
CUT IT SPIRALS DOWN AND THOSE

02:58:24.861 --> 02:58:28.364 region:rollup2
ADDICTIONS CAN BE LIFE CHANGING

02:58:27.263 --> 02:58:29.432 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE THEY STAY ON A RECORD

02:58:28.364 --> 02:58:30.400 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE IT HARDER TO GET AN

02:58:29.432 --> 02:58:31.701 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE PLACE.

02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:34.971 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY HAS RUNNING WATER

02:58:31.701 --> 02:58:36.206 region:rollup2
IN THE SIX THAT WE TAKE FOR

02:58:34.971 --> 02:58:37.140 region:rollup2
GRANTED AND THE OTHER THING I

02:58:36.206 --> 02:58:38.508 region:rollup2
WOULD IMAGINE IT'S JUST THE

02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:39.976 region:rollup2
INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE VIXEN

02:58:38.508 --> 02:58:41.044 region:rollup2
AND DOMESTIC ABUSE.

02:58:39.976 --> 02:58:41.844 region:rollup2

MILWAUKEE FOR A YEAR TO AND AND

02:58:44.013 --> 02:58:46.249 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT'S BUT I'M SURE

02:58:45.448 --> 02:58:47.984 region:rollup2
IT'S APPLICABLE HERE.

02:58:46.249 --> 02:58:49.919 region:rollup2
IS LANDLORDS DON'T LIKE IT WHEN

02:58:47.984 --> 02:58:51.054 region:rollup2

02:58:49.919 --> 02:58:52.055 region:rollup2
A VIOLENCE GOING ON IN YOUR

HOMEOWNER CALLING THE COPS FOR

02:58:52.055 --> 02:58:54.657 region:rollup2

02:58:53.723 --> 02:58:55.191 region:rollup2
TO PICK YOU.

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:56.759 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

02:58:55.191 --> 02:58:58.261 region:rollup2
PROTECTION AGAINST THAT THE TO

02:58:56.759 --> 02:59:00.129 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT POLICIES THAT ARE A

02:58:58.261 --> 02:59:01.664 region:rollup2
LITTLE OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM THAT

02:59:00.129 --> 02:59:03.199 region:rollup2
I WORK IN AT C. WTA IT AND

02:59:01.664 --> 02:59:04.667 region:rollup2

PROTECTION FROM THE POLICE FOR A

02:59:08.871 --> 02:59:12.408 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC INCIDENT ON JUST FOOD

02:59:10.707 --> 02:59:13.843 region:rollup2
FOR THOUGHT BECAUSE THE VICTIM

02:59:13.843 --> 02:59:15.345 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

02:59:14.544 --> 02:59:16.946 region:rollup2

02:59:15.345 --> 02:59:18.281 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT TOXIC STUFF THE

02:59:16.946 --> 02:59:19.882 region:rollup2
POVERTY THAT WE KNOW WHEN

03:00:29.819 --> 03:00:32.689 region:rollup2
THEIR ROLE THOROUGH ABOUT ASKING

03:00:31.154 --> 03:00:33.289 region:rollup2
THESE QUESTIONS BUT THEN THEY

03:00:32.689 --> 03:00:34.557 region:rollup2
CAN ONLY GO TO THERAPY FOR SO

03:00:33.289 --> 03:00:35.958 region:rollup2
LONG.

03:00:34.557 --> 03:00:37.560 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE THAT GO FROM THAT

03:00:35.958 --> 03:00:39.095 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEING IN THEIR SHOT BACK

03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:40.763 region:rollup2

03:00:41.564 --> 03:00:45.034 region:rollup2
OVER HERE. FOR SOMEBODY WITH

03:00:43.099 --> 03:00:47.170 region:rollup2
PTSD BECAUSE I KNOW I SUFFER

03:00:45.034 --> 03:00:49.205 region:rollup2

03:00:47.170 --> 03:00:51.007 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS IN THE HEIGHT NO BED

03:00:49.205 --> 03:00:53.576 region:rollup2
AT ONE POINT IN MY LIFE.

03:00:51.007 --> 03:00:57.246 region:rollup2
DOING A TO BE WAS LIKE DOING A

03:00:53.576 --> 03:00:59.015 region:rollup2
TO Z..

03:00:57.246 --> 03:01:01.951 region:rollup2

BECAUSE OF MY PTSD WILL ALLOW ME

03:01:11.561 --> 03:01:15.732 region:rollup2
TO GO SIT IN OFFICE FOR HOURS

03:01:13.596 --> 03:01:17.567 region:rollup2
AND HOURS ON END ARE ALL DAY

03:01:15.732 --> 03:01:19.335 region:rollup2
GOING FROM WINDOW TO WINDOW.

03:01:17.567 --> 03:01:22.271 region:rollup2
BEING TALKED DOWN TO BENT TALK

03:01:19.335 --> 03:01:25.074 region:rollup2
AT BEEN ASKED DEMEANING

03:01:22.271 --> 03:01:27.477 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

03:01:25.074 --> 03:01:28.978 region:rollup2
THAT SOUNDED LIKE MIGHT BE USER.

03:01:27.477 --> 03:01:31.481 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW INSIDE OF THE

03:01:28.978 --> 03:01:34.951 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT.

03:01:31.481 --> 03:01:36.786 region:rollup2
REALLY EVEN ANXIETY. FOUR PEOPLE

03:01:34.951 --> 03:01:38.421 region:rollup2
WHO ARE RECEIVING SERVICES AND

03:01:36.786 --> 03:01:39.322 region:rollup2
EVEN WORKING IN THE SHELTER WHEN

03:01:38.421 --> 03:01:40.556 region:rollup2
I WOULD HELP WOMEN WHO WOULD

03:01:39.322 --> 03:01:41.624 region:rollup2
COME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES OR

03:01:40.556 --> 03:01:43.092 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES.

03:01:41.624 --> 03:01:45.628 region:rollup2
IT IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THEM

03:01:43.092 --> 03:01:46.629 region:rollup2
THROUGH STAFF.

03:01:45.628 --> 03:01:47.964 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT

03:01:46.629 --> 03:01:49.499 region:rollup2
AGAIN BEGAN IN THAN THEY'VE

03:01:47.964 --> 03:01:50.700 region:rollup2
THEY'LL GO AND DON'T TRY TO DO

03:01:49.499 --> 03:01:50.933 region:rollup2
IT NOW COME BACK AND I'LL SAY A

03:01:50.700 --> 03:01:52.668 region:rollup2
WHILE.

03:01:50.933 --> 03:01:53.903 region:rollup2
MISS GHANA.

03:01:52.668 --> 03:01:55.638 region:rollup2
I GOT THE DOOR SLAMMED IN MY

03:01:53.903 --> 03:01:57.106 region:rollup2
FACE THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS IS

03:01:55.638 --> 03:01:58.341 region:rollup2
NOT AVAILABLE BUT I KNOW AS A

03:01:57.106 --> 03:02:00.510 region:rollup2
ADVOCATE BECAUSE I'VE DONE MY

03:01:58.341 --> 03:02:01.911 region:rollup2
RESEARCH YET THAT IS AVAILABLE

03:02:00.510 --> 03:02:03.346 region:rollup2
TO YOU AND THAT IN THAT IS YOUR

03:02:01.911 --> 03:02:04.680 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO HAVE THAT AS A DOMESTIC

03:02:03.346 --> 03:02:05.615 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE SURVIVOR SO ALSO

03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:08.050 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

03:02:05.615 --> 03:02:09.585 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT SYSTEMS AND

03:02:08.050 --> 03:02:11.654 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO ARE PROBABLY PEOPLE

03:02:09.585 --> 03:02:13.556 region:rollup2
WHO ARE DOING THE SERVICE ARE

03:02:11.654 --> 03:02:14.991 region:rollup2
ALSO GIVING A TRUTHFUL

03:02:13.556 --> 03:02:16.592 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO THE CLIENTS.

03:02:14.991 --> 03:02:17.894 region:rollup2
IS IT IN WRITING SO THEY CAN

03:02:16.592 --> 03:02:19.495 region:rollup2
READ IT.

03:02:17.894 --> 03:02:21.097 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I TELL

03:02:19.495 --> 03:02:22.198 region:rollup2
YOU BECAUSE WITH PTSD YOU WON'T

03:02:21.097 --> 03:02:23.733 region:rollup2
REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE A TV AYE

03:02:22.198 --> 03:02:25.034 region:rollup2
YOU WON'T REMEMBER IT SO AS I

03:02:23.733 --> 03:02:28.471 region:rollup2
WALK OUT THE DOOR I'LL FORGET

03:02:25.034 --> 03:02:30.473 region:rollup2
HAVE WHAT YOU SAID.

03:02:28.471 --> 03:02:32.975 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S YOU KNOW.

03:02:30.473 --> 03:02:34.911 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION TODAY IS HOW ARE YA

03:02:32.975 --> 03:02:36.445 region:rollup2
GONNA ADDRESS.

03:02:34.911 --> 03:02:36.979 region:rollup2
PUTTING TOGETHER A SYSTEM BACK

03:02:36.445 --> 03:02:40.750 region:rollup2
ALSO CREATES STABILITY FOR

03:02:36.979 --> 03:02:42.585 region:rollup2
FOLKS.

03:02:40.750 --> 03:02:43.686 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO STABILITY ITEM ONE

03:02:42.585 --> 03:02:45.087 region:rollup2
THE YOUNG LADIES AND I WAS A

03:02:43.686 --> 03:02:46.589 region:rollup2
LITTLE MOVE EMOTIONALLY MOVED BY

03:02:45.087 --> 03:02:47.924 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE SHE IS RIGHT.

03:02:46.589 --> 03:02:49.559 region:rollup2
IF THEY MAKE ONE DOLLAR OVER A

03:02:47.924 --> 03:02:51.561 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY THEIR

03:02:49.559 --> 03:02:52.628 region:rollup2
CUT OFF ON THIS AND SO IT

03:02:51.561 --> 03:02:54.063 region:rollup2
PROMISE OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC

03:02:52.628 --> 03:02:55.798 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE.

03:02:54.063 --> 03:02:58.968 region:rollup2
AND I LEAVE MY HOME AND I GO GET

03:02:55.798 --> 03:02:59.569 region:rollup2
ON ASSISTANCE AND I GET FIVE

03:02:58.968 --> 03:03:01.838 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS IF I GO

03:02:59.569 --> 03:03:03.706 region:rollup2
GET A JOB THAT FIVE HUNDRED AND

03:03:01.838 --> 03:03:10.880 region:rollup2
SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS.

03:03:03.706 --> 03:03:11.747 region:rollup2
I MADE A HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER A

03:03:10.880 --> 03:03:13.583 region:rollup2
LITTLE OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT

03:03:11.747 --> 03:03:16.919 region:rollup2
THEIR STILL DON'T QUALIFY FOR

03:03:13.583 --> 03:03:18.688 region:rollup2
ANYTHING. FOR WOMEN WHO ARE

03:03:16.919 --> 03:03:21.557 region:rollup2
MARRIED.

03:03:18.688 --> 03:03:22.992 region:rollup2
OR YOU VICTIMS WHO ARE MARRIED.

03:03:21.557 --> 03:03:24.794 region:rollup2
THE MISUSE OF THEIR AND FOR

03:03:22.992 --> 03:03:26.395 region:rollup2
PERSONAL INFORMATION THERE ARE

03:03:24.794 --> 03:03:28.231 region:rollup2
NO LAWS OUT THERE THAT PROTECT

03:03:26.395 --> 03:03:29.665 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN RELATION OR IN

03:03:28.231 --> 03:03:30.533 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS.

03:03:29.665 --> 03:03:32.335 region:rollup2
THAT ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

03:03:30.533 --> 03:03:33.870 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE.

03:03:32.335 --> 03:03:34.737 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE STUCK THEY'RE STUCK

03:03:33.870 --> 03:03:35.738 region:rollup2
WATCHING THEIR WHOLE LIFE BE

03:03:34.737 --> 03:03:37.473 region:rollup2
RIPPED DOWN [inaudible]

03:03:35.738 --> 03:03:40.643 region:rollup2
THEIR NAME [inaudible]

03:03:37.473 --> 03:03:41.477 region:rollup2
THEIR CREDIT.

03:03:40.643 --> 03:03:45.348 region:rollup2
THERE FINANCES THEIR BANK

03:03:41.477 --> 03:03:46.949 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS.

03:03:45.348 --> 03:03:48.417 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

03:03:46.949 --> 03:03:51.020 region:rollup2
INSIDE A DOMESTIC BONDS THAT.

03:03:48.417 --> 03:03:52.121 region:rollup2
NEAR NO NOBODY'S LOOKING AT ARE

03:03:51.020 --> 03:03:54.657 region:rollup2
THEY BEING PROSECUTED FOR THE

03:03:52.121 --> 03:03:55.825 region:rollup2
CRYING.

03:03:54.657 --> 03:03:57.593 region:rollup2
JUST IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS WE'VE

03:03:55.825 --> 03:03:59.862 region:rollup2

PROBABLY ABOUT TEN CASES.

03:03:59.862 --> 03:04:03.499 region:rollup2
WHERE THE PERSON WAS?

03:04:01.063 --> 03:04:05.234 region:rollup2
ONLY CHARGED WITH A VIOLATION OF

03:04:03.499 --> 03:04:07.103 region:rollup2
THE RESTRAINING ORDER BUT NOT

03:04:05.234 --> 03:04:08.571 region:rollup2
PROSECUTED FOR THE ACTUAL CRIME

03:04:07.103 --> 03:04:10.506 region:rollup2

WE WILL START WITH THE

03:04:11.574 --> 03:04:13.509 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER.

03:04:12.441 --> 03:04:15.378 region:rollup2
AND STRANGLED HER ON HER FRONT

03:04:13.509 --> 03:04:17.947 region:rollup2
PORCH THE NEIGHBORS CALL ON

03:04:15.378 --> 03:04:19.382 region:rollup2
FORCE.

03:04:17.947 --> 03:04:22.418 region:rollup2
HE WAS ONLY CHARGED WITH A

03:04:19.382 --> 03:04:23.753 region:rollup2
VIOLATION BECAUSE THEY LOOK THE

03:04:22.418 --> 03:04:25.254 region:rollup2

IN MIND YOU HAD LOST MANY JOBS

03:10:17.740 --> 03:10:21.010 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE

03:10:19.174 --> 03:10:23.078 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM TO PULL ME INTO COURT

03:10:21.010 --> 03:10:24.813 region:rollup2

MINE ARE GOING THROUGH BECAUSE

03:10:33.355 --> 03:10:38.427 region:rollup2
EVEN SOMETHING AS AS SMALL BUT

03:10:36.125 --> 03:10:40.296 region:rollup2
AS GRAND AS CONFIDENTIALITY WE

03:10:38.427 --> 03:10:43.132 region:rollup2
WERE UNABLE TO REACH OUT. TO

03:10:40.296 --> 03:10:45.100 region:rollup2
EVEN GET EMOTIONAL SERVICES

03:10:43.132 --> 03:10:46.168 region:rollup2
TAKING CARE BECAUSE THERE WAS

03:10:45.100 --> 03:10:47.703 region:rollup2
NOTHING IN PLACE THAT WOULD

03:10:46.168 --> 03:10:49.271 region:rollup2
PREVENT IT OUR ABUSER FROM USING

03:10:47.703 --> 03:10:51.240 region:rollup2
THAT AGAINST ME.

03:10:49.271 --> 03:10:53.208 region:rollup2
AS A MEANS OF WEAKNESS TO SHOW

03:10:51.240 --> 03:10:55.210 region:rollup2
UP SHE'S EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE.

03:10:53.208 --> 03:10:56.679 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T HOW CAN YOU GRANT

03:10:55.210 --> 03:10:58.647 region:rollup2
CUSTODY TO THESE CHILDREN YOUR

03:10:56.679 --> 03:11:00.282 region:rollup2
HONOR IF.

03:10:58.647 --> 03:11:01.917 region:rollup2
SHE'S EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE SO

03:11:00.282 --> 03:11:02.551 region:rollup2
EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS

03:11:01.917 --> 03:11:03.986 region:rollup2
AND HASN'T REALLY BEEN THAT

03:11:02.551 --> 03:11:05.120 region:rollup2
LONG.

03:11:03.986 --> 03:11:08.424 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IN PLACE FOR PEOPLE LIKE

03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:09.491 region:rollup2
US WHO HAVE THAT FEAR THAT WE

03:11:08.424 --> 03:11:10.859 region:rollup2
CAN'T REACH OUT TO THESE

03:11:09.491 --> 03:11:12.594 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SERVICES BECAUSE OUR

03:11:10.859 --> 03:11:14.363 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY MAY BE BROKEN

03:11:12.594 --> 03:11:15.631 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT MAY PUT US IN FEAR.

03:11:14.363 --> 03:11:17.266 region:rollup2
YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT MY

03:11:15.631 --> 03:11:18.734 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AT NINE ELEVEN THEY

03:11:17.266 --> 03:11:20.269 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE

03:11:18.734 --> 03:11:21.370 region:rollup2
TO RUN THEY KNOW WHAT IT FEELS

03:11:20.269 --> 03:11:23.272 region:rollup2
LIKE TO HAVE TO LIVE IN A CAR

03:11:21.370 --> 03:11:24.440 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WERE IN A SYSTEM

03:11:23.272 --> 03:11:26.475 region:rollup2
WHERE THE COUNTY DIDN'T GIVE US

03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:28.610 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MONEY. TO ALLOW US TO BE

03:11:26.475 --> 03:11:30.212 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET OFF OF AID AND

03:11:28.610 --> 03:11:31.547 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LIVE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS

03:11:30.212 --> 03:11:33.148 region:rollup2
WE LIVE WITHIN A SYSTEM WHERE

03:11:31.547 --> 03:11:35.150 region:rollup2
THAT COUNTY SYSTEM ACTUALLY MADE

03:11:33.148 --> 03:11:37.619 region:rollup2
US FEEL LIKE WORSE THAN WHAT WE

03:11:35.150 --> 03:11:40.489 region:rollup2
DID WHEN WE WERE BEING ABUSED.

03:11:37.619 --> 03:11:42.224 region:rollup2
AN HOUR ABUSER HE LITERALLY USED

03:11:40.489 --> 03:11:44.226 region:rollup2
TO RATION OUT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD

03:11:42.224 --> 03:11:46.628 region:rollup2
AND WATER THAT WE COULD CONSUME

03:11:44.226 --> 03:11:47.162 region:rollup2
SO TO SAY THAT A COUNTY SYSTEM

03:11:46.628 --> 03:11:49.164 region:rollup2
WHICH WE WERE WITHIN YOLO

03:11:47.162 --> 03:11:50.499 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

03:11:49.164 --> 03:11:52.067 region:rollup2
MADE US FEEL LESS THAN EVERY

03:11:50.499 --> 03:11:53.168 region:rollup2
TIME I HAD TO WALK IN THAT DOOR

03:11:52.067 --> 03:11:54.670 region:rollup2
EVERY TIME I HAD TO MAKE A PHONE

03:11:53.168 --> 03:11:55.971 region:rollup2
CALL EVERYTIME I HAD THE

03:11:54.670 --> 03:11:57.973 region:rollup2
QUESTIONER ASKED ABOUT.

03:11:55.971 --> 03:12:00.008 region:rollup2
IF WE COULD WERE ALLOTTED

03:11:57.973 --> 03:12:02.244 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND I WON'T EVEN GET

03:12:00.008 --> 03:12:04.113 region:rollup2
STARTED ON HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS

03:12:02.244 --> 03:12:05.981 region:rollup2
TO NOT ONLY GET.

THAT.

03:12:49.158 --> 03:12:52.161 region:rollup2

EVEN WORKING A FULL TIME JOB

03:12:59.034 --> 03:13:02.204 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T EVEN ALLOW ME

03:13:00.135 --> 03:13:04.573 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ABLE TO

03:13:02.204 --> 03:13:06.775 region:rollup2

WE'VE LIVED IN OUR CAR.

03:13:25.961 --> 03:13:30.466 region:rollup2
BEING CONSIDERED MAKING TOO MUCH

03:13:28.096 --> 03:13:32.601 region:rollup2

THAT FALLS IN THAT POVERTY LINE

03:13:43.812 --> 03:13:48.317 region:rollup2
IN THAT GAP.

03:13:46.081 --> 03:13:49.651 region:rollup2
