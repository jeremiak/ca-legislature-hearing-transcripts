00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:26.797
PROBLEM IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:29.199

CERTAIN WAY I DON'T KNOW IF

WE DO SUBSIDIZE PEOPLE'S

00:50:06.002 --> 00:50:07.237
EDUCATION QUITE A BIT.

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.805
PARTICULARLY THROUGH ALL OF OUR

00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:10.140
EFFORTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:12.008
MADE POSSIBLE THE YEARS. IN OUR

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:14.344
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM- I

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.645
DON'T HAVE SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:16.246
THAT OTHER SIDE OF IT I THINK

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:17.881
YOU KNOW IF WE WANT TO. SUPPORT

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:19.816
MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES- THAT

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:22.352
THAT THAT THAT THAT'S FINE BUT-

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:23.820
WE ALSO DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

00:50:23.887 --> 00:50:25.922
HOW MANY WAYS. HOW MANY

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:28.592
DIFFERENT WAYS FAMILIES SUPPORT

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:29.926
STUDENTS OR STUDENTS SUPPORT

00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:32.095
THEMSELVES FOR EXAMPLE. THOSE

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:33.363
WHO ARE WORKING AT THE SAME

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.399
TIME IS GOING TO SCHOOL. OR

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:37.501
THOSE WHO ARE. PUTTING THEIR

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:39.169
OWN SAVINGS AND SAID INTO THEIR

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:41.171
CHILDREN'S COLLEGE EDUCATION

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:42.239
RATHER THAN INTO THE RETIREMENT

00:50:42.305 --> 00:50:44.007
SECURITY. WHICH IS A HUGE

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:46.443
PROBLEM FOR FAMILIES. THAT THIS

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.645
DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AT

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:51.515
ALL AND- YOU KNOW I TRY TO KEEP

00:50:51.581 --> 00:50:52.883
UP ON THE LITERATURE SOME HIS

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:54.050
BOTH TRYING TO SAVE FOR MY

00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:56.386
CHILDREN'S COLLEGES WELL AS

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:59.389
SUPPORT OF MY OWN FUTURE. AND

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:00.991
THAT BORROWING MONEY FOR

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:04.261
COLLEGE IS A BETTER INVESTMENT

00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:04.861
THAN BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BORROW

00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:08.265
MONEY FOR RETIREMENT. SO YOU

00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:09.933
KNOW WE'RE YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.501
INFORMING PEOPLE ABOUT THAT THE

00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:12.602
FINANCIAL DECISIONS THAT

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:14.037
THEY'RE MAKING ON BEHALF OF

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:17.441
THEIR FAMILIES- AND SO I THINK-

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:18.375
I THINK IT'S KIND OF A BLUNT

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:19.910
INSTRUMENT I MEAN I'M HAPPY TO

00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:21.478
SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND- YOU

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:22.512
KNOW YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:24.347
HUMBOLDT. THE RESOLUTION WHICH

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:26.383
I'M SURE. WILL NOT GET FURTHER

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.652
THAN THE MEN'S FOR TAKING- BUT

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:30.287
YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD BECAUSE WE

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:31.555
WANT TO HELP PEOPLE YOU KNOW

00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:33.190
WHO ARE GOING TO COLLEGE. NOT

00:51:33.256 --> 00:51:36.393
NECESSARILY- THE INSTRUMENT TO

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.562
HELP- CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.230
AMERICAN FAMILIES REALLY PLAN

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:41.331
FOR BOTH THEIR THE RETIREMENT

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:44.768
SECURITY. AS WELL AS- HAVING

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:46.770
CAREERS WHERE YOU'RE MAKING

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:48.205
MORE MONEY THAN PEOPLE THAT

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:50.807
DON'T GO TO COLLEGE SO. ON YOU

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:52.609
KNOW THAT'S THE COST OF YOU

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:53.910
KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY GOING TO

00:51:53.977 --> 00:51:55.912
COLLEGES ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE-

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:56.813
IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE ON SOME

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.448
DEBT. MAYBE YOU'VE MADE A

00:51:58.515 --> 00:51:59.749
RATIONAL DECISION NOT TO GO TO

00:51:59.816 --> 00:52:01.384
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR NOT TO

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:03.253
WORK WHILE GOING TO COLLEGE. OR

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.387

DECIDED TO TAKE ON- SO- SO I

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:10.794
THINK. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:11.995
IT'S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:13.997
THAN JUST ST EVERYONE GETS

00:52:14.064 --> 00:52:15.098
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- BECAUSE

00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:16.066
YOU KNOW LIKE I'VE GOT A-

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:18.068
COUSIN IN GERMANY. WHOSE SON IS

NICE CAN GO TO UC OR CSU. WE

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:30.247
HAVE SAID THIS FOR COMMUNITY

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:31.848
COLLEGE AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:32.482
TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:35.252
CALIFORNIANS- BUT IT'S JUST A

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.286
BIT OF A BLUNT- BLUNT

00:52:36.353 --> 00:52:37.420

ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE THERE'S A

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:30.840
LOT MORE SOCIAL MOBILITY I MEAN

THE CHANCES. OF GETTING. OF

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:36.012
MOVING UP THE LADDER HERE IN

SOCIAL MOBILITY BUT THERE

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:54.197

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:58.969
THAT HAS TO DO WITH THEIR-

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:02.372
SOCIETAL AND POLICY- A- FOCUS.

00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:04.341

IN YOUNG PEOPLE I BOTH

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:16.386
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. OUT SO. I

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:17.621
DON'T THINK I WOULD SAY IS THAT

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:18.955
WHILE YOU WELL IT'S TRUE THAT

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:20.223
THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:21.958
IT'S ALL IT'S GOTTEN SO MUCH

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:22.859
WORSE IT'S SO MUCH WORSE

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.894
MEMBERS. THEN EVEN WHEN MOST OF

US. WERE GOING TO COLLEGE I

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.032
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA. IF

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:31.401
YOU COMPARE THE NUMBERS TODAY

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:32.302
TO WHAT THEY WERE BACK IN

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:34.437

GONE UP OVER TWO HUNDRED

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:39.809
PERCENT. EVEN THOUGH THE

SALARIES. HAVE ONLY GONE UP

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.282
ABOUT. ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. SO

THERE'S BEEN A HUGE. A HUGE

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:55.492
SPIKE IN THAT INCREASE. I. SO

OF THE OLDER TIMERS HERE IN THE

00:55:02.999 --> 00:55:05.235
BUILDING. YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY

00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:06.503
THEY THEY WERE GOING TO SCHOOL

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.738
TIME WHEN THE TUITION LEVELS

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:09.806
WERE SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY ARE

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:11.374
GERMANY AND THEY REALLY

00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:13.376
BENEFITED AND THEY WERE ABLE TO

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:15.979
PUT ALL THAT EXTRA. YOUR BRAIN

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:17.380
POWER AND MONEY THAT THEY

TWEAKING THIS ONE. TO REALLY

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.833
FOCUS IN ON A ROBUST. LOAN

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.468
FORGIVENESS SYSTEM FOR

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:39.803
EVERYTHING FROM PUBLIC SERVICE

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:41.838
OR LOW PAID- WORK THE PEOPLE

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:43.473
TAKE ON IT'S TRUE THAT A

COLLEGE DEGREE- OFTEN PROVIDES

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:47.410
PEOPLE WITH A HIGHER SALARY BUT

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:49.512
CERTAINLY NOT ALWAYS. ARE LOTS

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:51.014
OF PEOPLE TAKE THEIR THEIR

DEGREE AND THEY DON'T GET PAID

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:53.750
ANYWHERE NEAR AS WELL AS THEY

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:55.385
COULD BECAUSE THEY PURSUE THEIR

00:55:58.054 --> 00:55:58.855
OFTENTIMES ARE LOWER PAID WORK

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:00.190
REALLY DOES HAVE AN TRêN

00:56:00.256 --> 00:56:02.025
CREDIBLE SOCIETAL BENEFIT EVEN

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:03.693

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.529
BENEFIT FOR THE WORKER. I'VE

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:07.464
AND SO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.499
THAT. IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A

00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:11.601
WAY THAT YOU AND I CAN WORK ON

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:12.368
ON ON A MEASURE THAT WOULD

00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:14.370
REALLY TARGET. ARE THOSE FOLKS

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:15.238
WHO DECIDE TO TAKE ON LOWER

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.373
SALARIES- WHO DO WHO HAVE GONE

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.808
TO LOWER SERVED AREAS AND IN

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.143
RURAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.811

TAKEN ON THOSE CHALLENGES AND

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:31.321
BURDENS AND- AB SO I CERTAINLY
