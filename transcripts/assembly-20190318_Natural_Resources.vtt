SUBSEQUENT ACTION.

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:07.578
AND THEN THE SCOPE AND PROCESS

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:08.579
FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:10.181
COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:11.549

IN THESE COMMUNITIES.

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:24.162
AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME.

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:24.695
GO.

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:26.564
OUR BOARD ALSO SELECTED TEN

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:28.299
INITIAL COMMUNITIES TO LAUNCH

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:30.435
THE PROGRAM AND THE ORANGE DOTS

00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:32.270
ON THE SLIDE SHOW THOSE TEN

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:33.538
COMMUNITIES AND THE

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:35.606
CORRESPONDING AIR DISTRICTS ARE

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:37.208
SHOWN IN BLUE.

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:38.609
THIS INITIAL SAT ARE ALL HIGHLY

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:41.078
BURDENS THEY HAVE A MIX OF URBAN

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:42.880
AND RURAL COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT

00:34:42.947 --> 00:34:45.349
KINDS OF AIR POLLUTION SOURCES

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:47.618
AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITY SIZES

00:34:47.685 --> 00:34:48.419
BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE WHAT WE GET

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:49.720
IS GIVE REFLECTION AND THE

00:34:49.787 --> 00:34:51.322
DIVERSITY OF POLLUTION

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.990
CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:54.592
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:55.827
AND THEN THE GOAL IS THAT

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:58.129
STRATEGIES DEVELOPED IN THESE

00:34:58.196 --> 00:34:59.597
INITIAL SET OF COMMUNITIES

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.098
PROVIDE MODELS FOR ACTION IN

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:03.367
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:04.769
SIMILAR CHALLENGES.

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:06.671
AND TO SUPPORT THAT WILL BE

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:07.772
WORKING WITH THE ARE DISTRICTS

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.607
TO IDENTIFY THOSE STRATEGIES

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:11.242
THAT ARE WORKING AND THEN

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:12.643
LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES ON HOW

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.278
THOSE CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO A

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:16.814
BROADER SET OF COMMUNITIES.

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.316
THIS IS THE START OF A LARGER

00:35:18.382 --> 00:35:20.151
EFFORT AND WE DO EXPECT THAT THE

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:21.886
NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES WILL GROW

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:26.524
AS WE GROW THE PROGRAM OVER TIME.

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:28.025
SO THEY ARE DISTRICTS ARE NOW

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:29.460
WORKING WITH THE LOCAL

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:31.429
COMMUNITIES THROUGH COMMUNITY

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:33.731
STEERING COMMITTEES AND THIS IS

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.433
TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE ARE

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.567
MONITORING AS WELL AS THE

00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:38.636
EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS.

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:39.770
AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:41.939
SLIDE THE AIR MONITORING IS

00:35:42.006 --> 00:35:44.242
EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN JULY OF

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:45.009
THIS YEAR.

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:46.544
AND THEN AIR DISTRICTS NEED TO

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:48.012
BRING THE COMMUNITY EMISSION

00:55:11.007 --> 00:55:12.275
BE CONFIDENT.

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:13.176
THAT THE COMMUNITY THAT THE

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:14.678
MISSION REDUCTION PLAN THAT THE

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:16.913
BOARD ULTIMATELY CONSIDERS.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.648
IS EFFECTIVE AND WORKS IN A

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:20.483
SOLID AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.152
THE WAY TO DO THAT IS BEING

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:23.720
GAUGE FROM THE GET GO.

00:55:23.787 --> 00:55:25.355
AND NOT A ONLY FOR BOARDS

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:27.657
CONSIDERATION OF PLAN REALLY

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.059
THROUGHOUT ITS IMPLEMENTATION.

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:31.594
AND IF I COULD JUST ADD --

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.863
SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE EACH --

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.799
STEERING COMMITTEE ACROSS THE

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:37.033
REGION AND IS A LITTLE BIT

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.134
DIFFERENT BASED ON THEIR

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:40.103
COMPOSITION AND THEIR CULTURE

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:43.440
AND AND SO KAREN AND I HAVE BEEN --

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:44.708
AS I SAID MEETING WITH PEOPLE

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:46.976
BUT ALSO PAYING ATTENTION TO

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:48.278
WHAT THE NEEDS OF THOSE STEERING

00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:49.779
COMMITTEES ARE --

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:51.748
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW --

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:54.451
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE PEOPLE ARE UP

00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:56.586
AGAINST A FOR A REALLY TIGHT

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:57.554
CLOCK.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:01.124
AND I'VE EXPERIENCED A

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:02.592
DIFFERENCE OF THE US DURING

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:03.893
COMMITTEES WHERE --

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.729
SOME OF THAT MEMBERS OF THE

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:06.763
STEERING COMMITTEE FEEL LIKE

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:11.935
THEY DON'T HAVE A DEPTH OF UNDER

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:12.869
SO.

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:13.870
WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:15.672
INTERNAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:17.941
WE CAN PROVIDE THE TOOLS THAT

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:19.008
THE STEERING COMMITTEE NEEDS TO

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:20.710
BE ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE AT THEIR

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.412
JOBS AND SO OVER THE COURSE OF

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:23.880
THE NEXT YEAR AND ESPECIALLY AS

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.348

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:27.317
I THINK WE WILL BE DOING SOME

00:56:27.383 --> 00:56:28.752
COURSE ADJUSTMENTS SO THAT WE

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:30.053
CAN BE --

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:34.224
SUPPORT FOR THEM.

SCHEDULE FOR BARKED.

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:36.386
ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED

THOSE CUTS I NOTICED THAT THE

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:48.364
TEN REGIONS HAVE BEEN SELECTED

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:49.799
AND ALSO YOU MENTION JUST

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:50.433
MENTIONED ABOUT THE MONITORING

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.301
PLAN.

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:52.235
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CLEARING

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:54.404
HOUSE THAT BASICALLY IDENTIFIES

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.206
THE VARIOUS ALL PATERNITY OF SO

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.575
TECHNOLOGY ALTERNATIVES --

00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:00.743
TO COMBAT THE SITUATION HAS NOT

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:03.079
ALSO BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR AT

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:05.248
LEAST DESIGNED YES SO --

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:07.050
LAST SEPTEMBER WE ACTUALLY

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.985
LAUNCHED AN INITIAL VERSION OF

00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:10.420
THE CLEARING HOUSE SO IT CAN

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:11.621
SUPPORT THE EFFORTS THAT ARE

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:13.156
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:14.290
BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:16.392
DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMUNITY

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:18.228
MEMBERS AS WELL AS AIR DISTRICTS

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:19.729
ON HOW WE CAN FURTHER ENHANCE

00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.197
THAT AND ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:23.266
CONTRACT UNDER WAY --

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.968
TO FURTHER ENHANCE THAT --

00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:26.836
AND MAKE IT THE INFORMATION EVEN

00:58:26.903 --> 00:58:28.504
MORE USER FRIENDLY AND

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.072
ACCESSIBLE AND THAT WILL BE

00:58:29.138 --> 00:58:31.774
COMING OUT PROBABLY IN THE NEXT

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:32.242
SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR.

00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:34.244
SO THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD EXPECT

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:38.748
TO SEE A WRITTEN REPORT OF SORTS

00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:39.415
IT WOULD ANA.

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:40.049
WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE ONGOING

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:40.717
REPORTS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THAT

00:58:40.783 --> 00:58:41.251
IN THE INFORMATION THAT'S

00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:42.952

IMPLEMENTATION THEY'RE NOT WHEN

00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:56.299
WE GONNA GET TO SEE THAT IF AT

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:58.134
ALL IN THE NEXT FUTURE --

00:58:58.201 --> 00:58:59.869
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:02.505
THE A KEY POINT WILL BE LATE

00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:04.507
THIS YEAR I WILL BE AFTER THE

00:59:04.574 --> 00:59:06.175

I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS --

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:44.480
FIRST YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT MOBILE

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:46.716
SOURCES AND PARTICULARLY DIESEL

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:48.551
ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO A LOT

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:49.986
OF THESE COMMUNITIES --

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:52.121
HOW HOW WAS CARP GOING TO USE

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:54.891
ITS AUTHORITY --

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.926

STRATEGIES THAT YOU'RE

CONSIDERING EMPLOYING AND THEN

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:05.702
THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.003
IS ARE THERE OTHER STRATEGIES

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.006
THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.975
BE CONSIDERING IN YOUR VIEW.

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:14.043
WE HAVE FROM A CONTROL

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.379
STANDPOINT SHEESH THE INITIAL

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.413
RESPONSE IS NOT ON SENATE'S

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.983
IMPACT IT'S HEAVILY FOCUSED ON

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:22.485
REGULATION.

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:23.486
WE ARE THE MOST.

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:24.787
THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.389
OF MOBILE SOURCE HEAVY DUTY

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.658
REGULATIONS THEY WERE WORKING ON

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:29.926
THAT WE COMMITTED TO IN THE

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.194
HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.163
AND REALLY THOSE REGULATIONS BE

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.666
THEY HEAVY TRUCKS BE THE

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:40.036
DELIVERY TRUCKS TRANSIT BUSES.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:44.140
SCHOOL BUSES T. R. USE A

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:45.608
REFRIGERATED TRAILERS THAT RUN

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:47.043
ON DIESEL.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.678
THESE ARE TRANSITIONING EACH OF

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:50.713
THOSE TWO ELECTRIFICATION SO THE

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.515
COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION SOME OF

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:53.416
WHICH WE ALREADY BROUGHT TO THE

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:54.584
BOARD SOME WILL GO TO THE BOARD

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:55.451
THIS YEAR.

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:58.755
AND SOME IN THE NEXT YEAR TWO OR

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.056
TWO THREE YEARS.

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:02.625
VERY COMPREHENSIVE REALLY PHASE

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:03.326
OUT OF COMBUSTION.

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:06.629
AND REGULATIONS IN OUR MIND AND

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:07.930
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ARE A KEY

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.232
ELEMENT IN GETTING THEIR

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:10.566
INCENTIVE TO HELP MOVE THINGS

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:11.434
FORWARD.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.069
THE BIGGER CHALLENGE AND THIS IS

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:15.805
JUST A ONE THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:17.373
WITH THIS AN ORGANIZATION.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.742
IS ONE WERE ONE EFFORT IS THE

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.177
TIGHTER STANDARDS MOVING THIS

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.912
YEAR THAT I TALKED ABOUT.

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:25.081
THE OTHER ISSUE IS. ZERO THE

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:28.284
DIESEL EQUIPMENT THAT'S ON THE

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:29.419
ROAD TODAY.

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:30.720
THE LAST FOR DECADES.

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:32.722
AND WE HAVE A TRUCK AND BUS READ

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:33.790
BUT WE HAVE A MANY OTHER --

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.324
IT HEAVY DUTY PIECES OF

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.093
EQUIPMENT THAT COULD LAST FOR

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.694
THE NEXT FEW DECADES THE

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:40.263
CHALLENGES.

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:43.099
I DO WHAT WORLD INCENTIVES PLAY

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.233
AND INCENTIVES HAVE BEEN HELPFUL

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.569
ABOUT MOVING THAT DIRTY QUITMAN

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.271
OUT AND REPLACING.

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.006
IT WITH THE CLEANEST ZERO

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:52.875
MISSION TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN A

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:54.277
CHALLENGE AND IN SOME OF THAT

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.545
EQUIPMENT IS OWNED BY.

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:57.146
SINGLE OWNER OPERATORS LOWER

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.648
INCOME FOLKS.

01:01:58.714 --> 01:01:59.916
THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE HOW DO

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.118
YOU EXPEDITE THE TURNOVER OF THE

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.454
EXISTING DIRTY FLEET AT THE SAME

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.389
TIME YOUR TIGHTENING STANDARDS

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.124
FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:09.792
AND TRYING TO EXPEDITE THE

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:12.195
TURNOVER WITH INCENTIVES BUT

01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:13.329
INCENTIVES WILL NEVER COVER ALL

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.097
THAT.

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:15.598
THAT THAT'S A YOU ISSUE OUR

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.633
BOARD AND WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.902
STAKEHOLDERS ON RIGHT NOW TRYING

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:21.270
TO WORK THROUGH.

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:22.939
THANKS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:24.307
EMISSIONS ARE THERE IS THERE A

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:27.443
CENTRAL LISTING OF ALTERNATIVES.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.645
FOR JUST FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:32.482
OF EMISSION SOURCES

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:34.650
ON THE ON THE MOBILE SIDE WHAT

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:36.452
WE'VE DONE BECAUSE MOBILE SOURCE

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:38.020
ON HEAVY DUTY.

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:40.056
IT'S EXCEEDINGLY COMPLEX IN

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.291
TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF SOURCES.

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:44.460
OF A FORKLIFT IS DIFFERENT THAN

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.828
A PIECE OF CARGO HIM THE

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:46.829
EQUIPMENT IS DIFFERENT THAN A

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:49.098
CLASS SIX ROCKETS DIFFERENT THAN

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:51.367
A CLASS EIGHT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.002
PREPARE TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS.

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.937
FOR EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES OF

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.873
HEAVY DUTY AND IN TERMS OF

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:58.541
WHAT'S AVAILABLE IS ZERO

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.343
AVAILABLE TODAY ONE OF THE

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:01.777
EMISSIONS SO THIS IS SOMETHING

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:02.879
WE POSTED AND IT REALLY IS A

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.013
PREAMBLE.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.082
THAT WORK TO THE REGULATORY WORK

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:07.583
THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING SO

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:10.186
THAT IS ON OUR WEBSITE --

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:11.487
I I'M NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS IS

01:03:11.554 --> 01:03:14.757
USER FRIENDLY THESE ARE DETAILED

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.359
TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS.

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:17.126
AND THEN --

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:17.827
IN TERMS OF THE REPORTING

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:19.362
REQUIREMENTS WHAT WAS THE

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.330
CRITERIA AND HOW IT HOW DID YOU

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:22.865
BASE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THE

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:26.435
THRESHOLDS BASED ON AND HOW WERE

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:27.737
YOU ABLE TO IMPACT THAT.

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:29.138
TO JUDGE THE IMPACTS ON

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:31.073
COMMUNITY HEALTH --

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.575
WITH A LACK OF SORT OF PRIOR

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.278
DATA.

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:36.512
SO IN AND I THINK THE EMISSIONS

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:39.482
REPORTING YEAH REGULATION SO

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.317
WE'VE TAKEN SORT OF A TIERED

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:42.418
APPROACH --

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.087
IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS --

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:46.556
IN THE REGULATION AND IT'S

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:49.458
REALLY BASED ON THE PRIOR WORK --

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:53.796
THAT IS BEING DONE LOOKING --

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:54.330
FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:55.097
SCIENCE AND THE HEALTH

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:57.333
INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.367
SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:00.937
LOOKING AT CRITERIA POLLUTANTS

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.838
PM KNOCKS --

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:04.207
WE ARE NOW PROPOSING UP A

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:06.909
THRESHOLD FOR PERMITTED SOURCES

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:08.811
THAT EMIT MORE THAN TEN TONS PER

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.313
YEAR AND THAT'S A A PRETTY

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:12.081
CONSISTENT THRESHOLD WHEN YOU

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:13.649
GET TO TALK SIX OF COURSE IT

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:15.151
BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.586
THE HEALTH IMPACTS ARE MUCH MORE

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:17.653
SIGNIFICANT.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.989
SO FOR A NUMBER OF KEY AIR

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:22.858
TOXICS WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.894
REPORTING OF ALL SOURCES FOR

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:25.928
THOSE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:28.331
THINGS LIKE HEX CHROM COMING

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:29.732
FROM FROM PLAYERS ETCETERA.

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.434
AND THEN FOR OTHER KINDS OF

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.535
SOURCES --

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:33.869
IT'S STARTING TO LOOK AT

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:36.072
ADDITIONAL THRESHOLDS FOR THIS

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:37.406
AND THEN PART OF THIS IS ALSO

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:39.575
LOOKING AT RECOGNIZING THIS IS A

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:41.377
A LOT OF DATA THAT WILL NEED TO

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:42.612
BE COLLECTING OVERTIME.

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:45.281
WORKING TO PHASE THE

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:46.582
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REPORTING

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:51.087
REGULATION IN OVER A PERIOD OF

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:52.755

PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ON THE

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.461
BEST AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:02.798
TECHNOLOGY DATABASE.

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.200
SO -- THAT'S

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.068
THE TERMINOLOGY I WAS USING FOR

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:07.970
THE TECHNOLOGY CLEARING HOUSE SO

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.272
THAT WAS WHAT WE LAUNCHED AS AN

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:10.873
INTERIM VERSION AND THEN WE'RE

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.808

HAVE STE AND ACTION PLANS THAT

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:39.302
WILL BE COMING DOWN EVENTUALLY --

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:41.971
AND THE AIR BE.

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:42.838
WILL BE LOOKING AT THOSE ACTION

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:44.840

MEMBER A POINT I MADE EARLIER

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.491
WHICH IS.

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.126
THE OCTOBER ONE DEADLINE IS THE

01:06:04.193 --> 01:06:05.661
DATE BY WHICH THE DISTRICT WOULD

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:06.962
ACT ON THE COMMUNITY'S MISSION

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:08.664
REDUCTION PROGRAM.

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:10.766
IF EVEN THE HEAD OF THAT LAST

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:12.501
YEAR WAS THE BILL WHAT WE'RE

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:14.036
REFERRING IS THE BLUEPRINT WHICH

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:16.072
WAS WHAT IS THE BENCHMARK TO

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.341
ASSESS INEFFECTIVE COMMITTEE WHO

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.609
JOSH REDUCTION PLAN SO IT LAID

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:21.577
OUT [inaudible]

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.579
SUBSTANTIAL CRITERIA THAT WOULD

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:24.814
BE USED TO JUDGE THE

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.215
EFFECTIVENESS AND COMPREHENSIVE

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.184
NATURE OF A COMMUNITY REDUCTION

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:28.884
PLAN.

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.386
WE COULD PROMOTE CONSISTENCY AND

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.722
QUALITY THE OTHER ELEMENT.

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:34.156
WAS ENGAGEMENT THAT VERONICA

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:34.957
MENTION AT THE STEERING

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:36.325
COMMITTEE SO THAT WE'RE NOT

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:39.428
WAITING TO SEE A AL SOLVE THE

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.130
PLAN IS THAT WE CAN FALL WITH A

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.499
LONG AND ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:44.900
OF THE REALLY --

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:49.305
PARTS PRICES WE HAVE DESCRIBED

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:51.474
MUCH MORE TO ADD BUT THE

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.708
STEERING COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN I

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.477
MEAN I AM AND ALL OF THEM BUT

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:55.878
I'VE BEEN.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:58.581
TO QUITE A NUMBER OF THEM AND

01:06:58.647 --> 01:07:00.549
IT'S BEEN A REALLY HELPFUL TO

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:02.818
EXPERIENCE THE PROGRESS AS IT

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:04.286
UNFOLDS --

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:06.322
YOU'LL HEAR OF COURSE FROM --

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:07.490
WEST OAKLAND REBEL INDEED

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.091
INDICATORS PROJECT MISS MARGARET

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:10.292
GORDON -- AS

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:11.627
WELL AS IN THE AIR DISTRICT

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.562
THERE REALLY FARTHER ALONG THAN

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:16.065
ANYBODY ELSE IS IN THE PROCESS.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.501
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF LESSONS TO

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.903
BE LEARNED I THINK FROM WEST

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:24.206
OAKLAND AS THE OTHER.

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:26.842
COMMUNITIES BEGIN TO COME ALONG.

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:29.011
SO DO YOU EXPECT THAT.

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:30.246
NOW THAT YOU'RE ON THE GROUND IN

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:33.082
YOUR AT TEN THE IN THE STEERING

01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:34.517
COMMITTEES THAT YOUR BLUE PRATT

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:41.157
MIGHT CHANGE [inaudible] FORTY

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.459
SO THE THE STATUTE SAYS THAT YOU

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:44.994
KNOW AT A MINIMUM WE WOULD NEED

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.029
TO UPDATE THE BLUEPRINT WITHIN

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:47.930
FIVE YEARS.

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:48.998
I THINK CERTAINLY AS YOU'VE

01:07:49.064 --> 01:07:50.566
HEARD BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:52.067
BRAND NEW PROGRAM AND WE'RE ALL

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:53.169
LEARNING AND GROWING THAT WE

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.204
WOULD EXPECT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:56.972
TO THE BLUEPRINT MUCH EARLIER

01:07:57.039 --> 01:08:00.309
THAN THE FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:00.876
SINCE WE'RE LEARNING SO MUCH

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:02.077
THIS YEAR.

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:02.711
THANK YOU ACTUALLY I DO HAVE ONE

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:03.579
MORE QUESTION BEFORE I MOVED TO

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:04.713
MY COLLEAGUES --

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.082
ON YOUR SLIDE NINE YOU SHOULD AN

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:08.818
AIR TOXICS MONITOR AND I'M

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.653
WONDERING IF A OR B. OR ANY

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.488
OTHER THEY ARE DISTRICT US

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:13.689
DEPLOYED ANY.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.858
THEIR TOXIC MONITORS PURSUANT TO

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.227
AB SIX SEVENTEEN AND IF SO IF

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:21.630
THAT A MISSION ST IS AVAILABLE

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:22.198
TO THE PUBLIC AND WHERE THAT

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:22.965
WOULD BE.

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.100
SO THERE IS A A ROUTINE.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.069
AIR TOXICS NETWORK ACROSS

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:28.737
CALIFORNIA THAT WE IN THE LOCAL

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:30.406
AIR DISTRICTS HAVE HISTORICALLY --

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:34.076
OPERATED WHAT TAP IS THROUGH THE

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:35.878
COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES --

01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:36.979
THE AIR DISTRICTS ARE WORKING

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:38.180
WITH THOSE COMMITTEES TO

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.982
IDENTIFY WHAT KIND OF THINGS WE

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:42.017
WANT TO MONITOR FOR AND THE MOST

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.452
APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES.

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:44.453
AND I THINK YOU'LL BE HEARING

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.588
FROM SOME OF THE AIR DISTRICTS

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.456
TODAY WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:49.692
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT AIR TOXICS

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:50.893
IS ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.228
THAT AND SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.696
WHICH KINDS OF APPROACHES

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:54.997
THEY'LL BE USING --

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.999
AND HOW TO MAKE THAT INFORMATION

01:08:57.066 --> 01:09:00.736
AVAILABLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.272

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:03.572
[inaudible]

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:04.540
SEPTEMBER.

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:06.342
I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION ON IT'S

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:07.810
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.578
STATIONARY SOURCES ARE WITHIN

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.013
THE JURISDICTION OF BOTH THE

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.216
COUNTY AS WELL AS THE A. R. B. --

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:17.386
STILL IS IT CORRECT TO SAY THAT --%

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:19.054
STATIONARY SOURCES IS REALLY

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:20.623
NOTHING NEW AS FAR AS COLLECTING

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.058
DATA ABOUT STATIONARY SOURCES.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:24.460
FROM -- FROM

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.995
THE A ARBY'S PERSPECTIVE WOULD

01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:27.663
THAT BE A CORRECT STATEMENT.

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:30.099
FROM AN OVERALL AFFORD THESE AIR

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:32.268
QUALITY AUTHORITY STANDPOINT

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.969
IT'S THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.571
THAT HAVE PERMITTING AND

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.072
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:39.141
OVER STATIONARY SOURCES

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:42.144
STATUTORY SEVENTEEN IS THE FIRST

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:45.147
TIME THAT THE A A RP IS KIND OF

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:47.683
DOING A STATIONARY SOURCES OR

COMMUNITIES IN REAL RECOGNIZE

01:09:58.327 --> 01:09:59.194
THAT.

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:01.997
YOU COULD EFFECTIVELY LEAD TO A

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:03.566
EFFECTIVE EMISSION REDUCTION

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:04.667
PROGRAM WITHOUT CLOSE

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:07.403
COLLABORATION BETWEEN BOTH THOSE

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:09.805
PLAYERS.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.006

LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY FROM.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:16.111
FROM EVERYBODY BUT I THERE IS A

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:17.846
COUPLE WORDS I'VE HEARD --

THROUGHOUT THIS IS PARTNERSHIP.

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.282
YEAH WE HEAR THAT A LOT RIGHT

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:21.917
NOW AND I'M ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:22.651
BY THIS --

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.820
BECAUSE AS WAS STATED YOU KNOW

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:25.854
FROM OUR MY COLLEAGUES.

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:27.489
WE START PAINTING IN BROAD

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.224
BRUSHES IN THE STATE.

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.726
IT DOESN'T WORK AT TIMES BECAUSE

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.027
ALL OF OUR INDIVIDUAL OR

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.296
DISTRICTS HAVE UNIQUE CHALLENGES

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:34.964
WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.931
SERVE.

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:37.700
I REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.401
AND SO WE HAVE A LARGE AG REGION.

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.437
AS I'M JUST CURIOUS --

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:44.239

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:46.675
APPROACH.

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:47.443
I THINK --

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.044
THE COMMUNITIES THEY RESPOND TO

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:50.980
INCENTIVES AND IT'S CERTAINLY

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:53.816
COMING FROM AN AG BACKGROUND.

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:54.383

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:57.653
BOLSTER THOSE TO GET MORE OF

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.154

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:04.660
REMOVE.

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:05.894
HOW CAN WE BOTH BOTH OF THOSE

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.529
PROGRAMS AND IF THEY'RE NOT

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:08.597
WORKING WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:10.432
THOSE BETTER AND SOLIDIFY THEIR

01:11:10.499 --> 01:11:11.567
SUCCESS?

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:13.702
YEAH I'LL I'LL BRIEFLY SPEAK TO

PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE FARMER

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:21.443
WHICH IS.

METRIC IN TERMS OF DIESEL

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:30.986
EMISSION REDUCTIONS.

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:32.755
COST EFFECTIVENESS A TRACK

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:33.956
RECORD OF EFFECTIVE

IMPLEMENTED FOR MANY MANY YEARS

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:41.597
THE DECADE DECADES IN SOME CASES.

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:43.098
DEPENDING EXCEEDINGLY AFFECTED

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:45.334
THE ISSUE IS THEIR SUBSTANTIALLY

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:46.702
OVERSUBSCRIBED.

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.037
THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH FUNDING BUT

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:49.204
FOR THE FUNDING HAS BEEN

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:50.873
APPROPRIATE IN AVAILABLE THEY

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:54.643
WORK IN THERE'S ESTABLISHED

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:55.244
TRACK RECORD THAT THEY DO JUST

WE CAN BE.

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:21.804
HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE I

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.439
DO BELIEVE THAT THE THE AG

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:26.075
INDUSTRY IS READY AND WILLING --

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:26.575

INCENTIVES AND I KNOW THAT

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:29.111
MOVING FORWARD.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.813

IN THE QUEUE.

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:33.582
AND THAT FUNDING NUMBER IS NOT

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:34.917
THERE AND IT IS A BIG NUMBER AS

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:36.518

THAT PRICE GOES THROUGH THE ROOF

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:41.123
PER UNIT.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.591
AND SO THIS FUNDING SOURCES A

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:45.227
HUGE CONCERN OF ALL OF OUR

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:46.729

COMMUNITIES --

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:02.244
WERE WERE SELECTED --

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.646
I I SEE AND SOME OF THE

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:06.014
MATERIALS THAT WERE.

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:07.249
DISTRIBUTED BY THE COMMITTEE

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:07.950
THAT -- ONE

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:09.818
OF THE CORE CRITERIA WAS POVERTY

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:11.286
LEVELS --

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:14.056
BUT I I WANT TO KNOW.

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:20.896
A LARGE REFINERY --

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.264
THE THAT IS --

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:25.534
SURROUNDED BY A DENSE ID --

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:27.569
SUBURBAN MIDDLE CLASS LARGELY

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:30.773
MIDDLE CLASS COMMUNITIES AND SO --

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:32.141
HOW HOW WOULD?

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:32.875
TO YOU KNOW --

BE BE COVERED BY --

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:39.815
THE PROVISIONS AB [inaudible]

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:42.317
SIX SEVENTEEN SO WE SET OUT --

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:43.952
IN THE BEGINNING SOME BROAD

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:46.155
CRITERIA THAT WE ASKED THEM

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:48.590
LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS WORKING WITH

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:50.092
COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.460
BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:54.029
REGION. TO LOOK AT IN THAT IN

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.397
COLLUDED OF COURSE JUST

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:56.932
UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU'RE

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.400
POLLUTION LEVELS WERE IN THE

01:13:58.467 --> 01:13:59.668
COMMUNITY --

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:01.870
BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:04.072
SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.808
INCREASE VULNERABILITY TO AIR

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.509
POLLUTION SUCH AS POVERTY AT

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:08.710
CETERA --

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:10.579
AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT HEALTH

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:12.414
IMPACTS THAT WE KNOW ARE OFTEN

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:14.950
VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO AIR

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.251
POLLUTION HEART ATTACKS

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.619
PREMATURE BIRTH RESPIRATORY

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:18.987
DISEASE --

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.923
AND THEN THEY WORK THROUGH A

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:23.225
PUBLIC PROCESS TO WEIGH ALL OF

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.927
THOSE AND PROVIDE

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:27.196
RECOMMENDATIONS TO US FOR

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:28.630
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY THOUGHT

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.833
WOULD REALLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:33.235
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRST YEAR

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.504

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:48.884
HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES --

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:49.718
THAT REALLY HAVE SIMILAR

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:51.119
CHALLENGES AND THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:53.355

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:00.295
THAT AS WE IDENTIFY THINGS THAT

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:02.097
ARE WORKING IN THESE COMMUNITIES

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.432
REALLY LOOK AS QUICKLY AS

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:04.833
POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THEY CAN BE

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.570
IMPLEMENTED ELSEWHERE.

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:09.438

POVERTY LEVELS ALSO HAVE THE

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.990
HIGHEST LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTION.

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:29.458
AND GENERAL IF YOU LOOK ACROSS

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:31.693
THESE THEY ALL HAVE SOME OF THE

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.195
HIGHEST LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTION

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:35.664
IN THE REGION THEY ARE ALL --

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:37.065

ALTHOUGH THERE CLERK CLEARLY FOR

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.436
THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE SELECTED

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:15.871
THERE NEEDS TO BE A FOCUSED

I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER TO THE

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:47.362
QUESTION IS THAT WE ARE ON TRACK.

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:48.797

THE HOME TO THE LARGEST OF

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.223
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE LARGEST

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:26.101
AT THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:27.202
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WE'RE PROUD

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:29.871
OF OUR EFFORTS IN IMPLEMENTING.

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:30.639
SIX SEVENTEEN IN WORKING WITH

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:32.274
OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO NOT

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.508
ONLY IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THE

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:34.476
LOCAL.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.211
CONDITIONS AND SOURCES IN THOSE

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:37.546
COMMUNITIES BUT TO ESTABLISH

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:39.481
KERR MONITORING PLANS AND MOST

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:40.816
IMPORTANTLY.

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.384
I CAN'T OVER EMPHASIZE THIS BUT

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:43.685
TO ESTABLISH EMISSION REDUCTION

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:45.954
PLANS THAT'S REALLY THE KEY HERE

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:47.656
IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTIONS.

01:18:47.722 --> 01:18:49.791
TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH IN

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:51.026
THESE COMMUNITIES.

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:52.260
A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS MANAGER

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:54.229
BEFORE HANDED OVER A IS REALLY

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:56.164
THAT WE BELIEVE IN THE BAY AREA

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:57.966
WERE EQUAL PARTNERS WITH OUR

01:18:58.033 --> 01:19:00.402
COMMUNITY LEADERS --

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:01.937
AND THAT COMES DOWN TO NOT ONLY

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:04.039
HOW WE CONDUCT OURSELVES IN

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:05.941
TERMS OF FORMING THE STEERING

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:07.008
COMMITTEE WITH OUR COMMUNITY

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.443
PARTNERS BUT CONDUCTING THOSE

MEMBERSHIPS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:12.614
BUT HOW THE MEETINGS THEMSELVES

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:13.582
HER --

01:19:13.648 --> 01:19:15.684
CONDUCTED BUT THEN ALSO THAT IS

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.619
REALLY CRITICAL AND PARAMOUNT AS

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:20.288
TO HOW WE ESTABLISH WHAT GOES

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:20.922
INTO THE MISSION REDUCTION PLAN

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:22.858
AS WELL.

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:23.458
THE OTHER KEY POINT ONE LEVY

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:24.860
WITH BEFORE HAND IT OVER TO MR

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.828
NOTED MY DEPUTY IN CHARGE OF

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:27.729
THIS EFFORT.

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:29.297
HE IS THAT REALLY ALL EMISSION

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:32.267
REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES AND AND

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:33.935
SOLUTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE.

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:36.438
WE HAVE THE DISTRICT OF COURSE

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.273
ARE A PROUD OF ESTABLISHING THE

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.542
MOST STRINGENT AIR TOXICS

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.043
MISSION STANDARD IN THE STATE

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:43.478
FOR A STATIONARY SOURCES.

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:47.349
BUT WE KNOW THAT TIME MOBILE OF

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:48.617
CREATING THE RISK IN THESE

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:49.851
COMMUNITIES AS WELL.

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:50.919
AND SO -- WE

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.420
REMAIN OPEN TO BE ABLE TO

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.623
IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT ANY OR

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:56.625
ALL MEASURES NECESSARY.

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:57.225
TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH IN

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.426
THESE COMMUNITIES TAKE IT VERY

01:19:58.493 --> 01:19:59.561
SERIOUSLY.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.695
SO LET ME --

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:02.998
DO THIS AND HANDED OVER TO MR

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.065
NODE AND ALL.

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:05.467
I THINK COME BACK ON OUR LAST

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:06.902
SLIDE AND IF YOU CAN.

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:08.603
NOTICE OF IT AS WELL.

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:09.571
GREAT MY NAME IS GREG NOW DIE

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.973
AND DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.843
POLICY AT SAID BEAR AIR DISTRICT.

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:17.479
AND WALK YOU THROUGH KIND OF OUR

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:19.814
APPROACH TO EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:21.016
IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA --

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:24.186
IN REFERENCE TO THE ASSEMBLY

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:27.756
MEMBERS RECENT IN THE BAY LOOKED

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:28.857
AT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAD

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.192
HIGH VULNERABILITY TO AIR

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:31.359
POLLUTION.

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:32.427
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF SOCIO

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.962
ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT FEED INTO

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:34.796
THAT BUT ONE OF THE KEY

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:37.632
PARAMETERS THAT WE LOOKED AT WAS.

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:39.301
LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH AND

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:40.569
ACROSS ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.837
EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE AT TEN TO

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:44.606
FIFTEEN YEAR DIFFERENCE IN LIFE

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.107
EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH BETWEEN.

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:48.043
WEST OAKLAND FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:48.910
SOME OF THE WEALTHIER

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:50.445
COMMUNITIES UP IN THE HILLS.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.280
SO WE LOOKED AT THAT PARAMETER

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.149
WE ALSO LOOKED AT EXPOSURE TO

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:55.116
AIR POLLUTION.

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:57.419
AND THE INTERSECTION OF THOSE

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:59.221
TWO SETS IS WHERE WE CAME UP

01:20:59.287 --> 01:20:59.688
WITH OUR HIGH PRIORITY

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:01.423
COMMUNITIES.

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:03.725
AND WE SELECTED WEST OAKLAND FOR

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.060
AN ACTION PLAN IN YOUR ONE

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.228
BECAUSE QUITE A BIT OF

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:07.462
MONITORING HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE

GIVE SOME CREDIBILITY TO THE

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:51.139
OVERALL PROCESS.

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:52.707

AS JACK MENTIONED IT HAS A LARGE

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:57.312
PORT -- AND

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:59.314
A LOT OF OTHER SOURCES OF MOBILE

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:01.983
SOURCE RISK A COUPLE OF LARGE

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.685
AIR TOXICS FACILITIES THAT ARE

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.053
WITHIN OUR REGULATORY AUTHORITY

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.187
AS WELL.

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:07.022
I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AS MINUTES

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:08.790
IN A MINUTE AND THEN OF COURSE

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:12.761
THE HIGH HEALTH BURDENS --

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:13.862
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COMMUNITY.

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.730
SO WE HAVE BEEN IN WEST OAKLAND

FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS --

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:18.767
WORKING WITH --

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:20.468
WEST OAKLAND THE I. P..

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:22.570
AND THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

01:22:22.637 --> 01:22:24.472
PUTTING TOGETHER THE THE

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:25.040
STEERING COMMITTEE AND

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:26.841
IMPLEMENTING SB SIX SEVENTEEN IN

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:27.776
WEST OAKLAND.

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:29.577
WE'VE BEEN MEETING WEEKLY WITH

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:30.945
OUR PARTNERS IN THE WEST OF

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:32.347
LUMBER MILL INDICATORS PROJECT.

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:33.815
AND TO HAVING MONTHLY TECHNICAL

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:36.451
MEETINGS TO GO OVER THE DETAILS

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:37.085
OF THE TECHNICAL WORK THAT WE'RE

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:38.253
DOING.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.187
OKAY INTRODUCTION TO THAT

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:41.823
TECHNICAL WORK.

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:43.124
EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION IN A

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:44.859
COMMUNITY IS A COMBINATION OF

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:46.361
REGIONAL SOURCES AND LOCAL

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.495
SOURCES.

01:22:47.562 --> 01:22:48.797
AND SO WE DID AN EXTENSIVE

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:51.032
ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:53.101
PERCENTAGE WAS SENT ON FOCUSING

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:54.536
ON CANCER RISK RIGHT HERE.

01:22:54.602 --> 01:22:56.538
BUT IT ALSO APPLIES TO THINGS

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:57.939
LIKE PARTICULAR MATTER AND

01:22:58.006 --> 01:22:59.307
DIESEL PM AND THAT SORT OF THING.

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:03.745
SO IN WEST OAKLAND A'S BIRD 30%

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.747
OF THE BURDEN IS DUE TO LOCAL

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.549
SOURCES --

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:08.983
FOR CANCER AND THIS CANCER RISK

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:10.819
NUMBER THE FOUR HUNDRED NINETY

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:12.554
SIX PER MILLION IT'S A TOOL THAT

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.089
THE IN OUR OFFICE AND ARE MENTAL

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:14.589
HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.891
DEVELOPED. TO GIVE US ONE

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:19.294
MEASURE OF COMBINATION OF RISKS

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.496
FROM MULTIPLE POLLUTANTS SO.

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:22.997
ANYBODY BREATHE IN THE AIR AND

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:25.400
AND AND WEST OAKLAND RIGHT NOW.

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.302
HAS THE SIX HUNDRED IN A MILLION

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:29.371
CHANCE OF DEVELOPING CANCER OVER

01:23:29.437 --> 01:23:30.872
THIRTY YEAR PERIOD DO THE

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:32.474
EXPOSURE TO THAT POLLUTION.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.976
OF THAT SIX HUNDRED MILLION A

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:35.577
HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX PER MILLION

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:38.380
IS DUE TO THESE LOCAL SOURCES.

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:39.714
AND THE LOCAL SOURCES VARY

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.383
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE.

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:43.752
MISS PARKER TALKS A LOT ABOUT

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:45.253
PROXIMITY AND EXPOSURE.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.688
AND NOT JUST FOCUSING ON

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.990
EMISSIONS AND THAT LAYS OUT IN

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:50.458
THIS MAP HERE AND WHAT THIS MAP

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:53.194
SHOWS IS HOW CANCER RISK VARIES

01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.863
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.264
WEST OAKLAND.

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:57.899
AND FOR ANY SPOT ON THIS MAP WE

CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE PERCENTAGE

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.536
CONTRIBUTION IS.

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.238
AT THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION A

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:04.806
COUPLE OF THINGS TO NOTE HERE

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:05.907
KIND OF IN THE IN THE LOWER

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:08.109
MIDDLE SECTION OF THE CHART AND

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:09.477
IN THE UPPER.

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:10.845
LEFT YOU SEE A COUPLE OF

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:11.946
STATIONARY SOURCES THAT ARE

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:13.281
SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTING TO

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:14.315
RESCUE.

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:16.117
THOSE SOURCES ARE SUBJECT TO THE

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:19.554
RULE THE JACK MENTIONED OUR RULE

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:20.121
ELEVEN EIGHTEEN AND THEY'RE

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:20.955
GONNA BE REQUIRED TO GET THEIR

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:22.824
CANCER RISK DOWN TO TEN IN A

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:26.294
MILLION OR LESS UNDER THAT RULE --

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:27.295
THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT SOURCES

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.464
BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY BLEND

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:31.433
IN WITH THE OTHER SOURCES OF

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:33.368
RISK IN THE COMMUNITY --

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:36.438
AND OVERALL THE TO TRUCKS AT

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:39.874
ABOUT 33% AND MARINE VESSELS AT

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:41.276
31% --

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:42.110
PERMITTED FACILITIES THE ONES

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:43.378
THAT WITH AND WITHIN OUR

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:44.546
JURISDICTION.

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:46.915
ACCOUNT 410% OF THE RISK BUT

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:48.450
THAT'S KIND OF AVERAGED OUT OVER

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:49.384
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY ANY

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:50.018
PARTICULAR POINT IN THE

01:24:50.084 --> 01:24:52.387
COMMUNITY YOU'RE GONNA SEE A

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:54.355
DIFFERENT SOURCE APPORTIONMENT.

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:55.824

PROCESS.

01:25:04.098 --> 01:25:04.966
THANK YOU GREG.

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.634
SO SINCE THE WEST OAKLAND ACTION

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:08.169
PLAN IS AN EMISSION REDUCTION

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:09.671
PROGRAM AS COMPARED TO ONE MONTH.

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:11.105
COMPARED TO A MONITORING PROGRAM

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:13.374
THE PLAN FOCUSES ON STRATEGIES

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:14.409
THAT BOTH DIRECTLY REDUCE

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:15.844
EMISSIONS AS WELL AS REDUCING

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:17.111
THE COMMUNITY'S EXPOSURE TO

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:18.513
EMISSIONS.

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.514
SO FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS THEIR

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:21.382
NEXT NEW POLL THE MIKE A LITTLE

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:21.783
CLOSER TO YOU --

AND USE MY OUTDOOR.

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:31.092
SO FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:31.626
THE YEAR DISTRICT OF THE

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:32.627
STEERING COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:33.728
WORKING TOGETHER ON A BROAD

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.197
RANGE OF STRATEGIES THAT ARE

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.298
REPRESENTED ON THE SLIDE.

01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:38.500
SO STARTING AT THE TOP ONE OF

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:39.901
THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES TO THE

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:42.003
COMMUNITY IS INCOMPATIBLE LAND

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.937
USES.

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:44.772
SO THE WEATHER INDUSTRIALIZED

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:45.473
COMMITTEES WHETHER THEIR

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:46.341
PERMANENT OR NOT --

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:47.775
OFTENTIMES DIRECTLY NEXT TO

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:50.111
PEOPLE'S HOMES SCHOOLS AND OTHER

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:51.279
SENSITIVE RECEPTORS.

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:52.714
AND THE NEXT RELATED TO LAND USE

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:53.915
ISSUES OUR TRUCK RELATED

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.617
BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN OR NEAR

01:25:55.683 --> 01:25:56.951
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:58.019
THE CITY OF OAKLAND CURRENTLY

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.487
HAS A DRAFT TRUCK MANAGEMENT

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:00.722
PLAN THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:03.324
THESE CONCERNS HOWEVER ARE AB

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:04.559
SIX SEVENTEEN PLAN --

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:05.193
SEEKS TO ADD TO THOSE MEASURES

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:09.697
AS WELL ZHU'S IN THAT DRAFT PLAN.

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.132
ALSO THERE STRATEGIES THAT HAVE

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:12.200
TO DO A FUNDING --

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:13.334
CERTAINLY FOR FUNDING CLEANER

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.270
EQUIPMENT BUT ALSO TO ENSURE

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:16.838
THAT AGENCIES IN THE COMMUNITY

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.172
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:19.507
SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED THE NEW

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:20.608
PROGRAMS.

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:22.644
AS WELL AS TO IMPLEMENT EXISTING

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:23.244
PLANTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:25.246
ADOPTED.

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:26.247
STRATEGIES THAT WOULD HELP

01:26:26.314 --> 01:26:28.049
REDUCE EXPOSURE TO POLLUTION AND

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:29.250
CREWS INCLUDE GREEN

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:30.552
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:31.953
SO FOR EXAMPLE VEGETATIVE WALLS

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.254
CAN MITIGATE POLLUTION COMING

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:35.423
FROM FREEWAYS BUT ALSO TREES CAN

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.658
BE PLANTED AROUND SCHOOLS AND

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:38.026
OTHER SENSITIVE RECEPTORS FROM

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.994
STREET TRAFFIC --

01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:41.529
THAT GENERATES POLLUTION.

01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:43.064
BUT AS MANY OF OUR STRENGTH MANY

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.098
COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE POINTED

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:45.934
OUT IT'S NOT JUST PLANTING THE

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.435
TREES THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:48.636
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THAT

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:49.904
ENSURES THAT THE TREES ARE

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:51.839
MAINTAINED AND WATER IT'S THAT

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.575
THEIR SUSTAINABLE.

01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:54.842
AT ONE OF OUR RECENT STEERING

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:56.244
COMMITTEE MEETINGS THAT REALLY

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:56.978
SEEM TO BE ONE OF THE MOST

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.846
POPULAR WAS WE INVITED THE

01:26:58.913 --> 01:26:59.380
OAKLAND.

01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:01.015
CITY VOCALS PLANNING DIRECTOR

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.383
AND THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:03.284
HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO COME AND

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:04.552
PRESENT ON THEIR DIFFERENT

01:27:04.619 --> 01:27:07.055
AGENCIES ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:08.756
AND IT REALLY DEMONSTRATED HOW

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:11.025
INTERTWINED PLANNING POLICIES

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:14.295
ARE. TO TO HEALTH OUTCOMES.

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:16.064
SO THAT THAT MEETING GENERATED A

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.298
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:18.833
THAT IDENTIFIED DIFFERENT WAYS

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:19.934
THAT WE CAN COORDINATE AMONG

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:21.936
LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:23.104
AGENCIES.

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:24.372
AND THEN LASTLY BROAD GROUP OF

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:25.873
CATEGORIES INCLUDES IMPLEMENTING

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.141
AND TRACKING PROGRESS OF THESE

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.343
EXISTING PLAN.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:30.044
PLANS WHICH INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.546
MEASURES.

01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:33.514
JUST LAST LAST WEEK WE HAD OUR

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:34.315
MOST RECENT STEERING COMMITTEE

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:35.316
MEETING.

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:38.419
AND WE HAD CONSENSUS FROM THE

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:40.088
STEERING COMMITTEE ON A HUNDRED

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:41.389
AND TWENTY NINE DISTINCT

01:27:41.456 --> 01:27:44.492
MEASURES SO THAT WAS I THINK

01:27:44.559 --> 01:27:45.093
EVERYONE CLAPPED AT THE END OF

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.127
THAT MEETING.

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:47.562
VERY EXCITING MEANING TO COME TO

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:48.796
THAT CONCLUSION AND HAVE THAT

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:50.798
THAT CONSENSUS STAR NEXT UP IS

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:53.501
GOING TO BE PRIORITIZING THOSE.

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:55.136
THOSE DIFFERENT MEASURES WHAT

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:56.304
WOULD BE DONE IMMEDIATELY AND

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:57.939
THEN MID TERM AND THEN SLIGHTLY

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:58.873
LONGER TERM --

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:02.410
NEXT SLIDE [inaudible]

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:04.045
THANKS.

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.146
SO THERE CERTAINLY ARE SOME

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.581
CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY --

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.349
RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES ARE NOT

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:09.417
ALWAYS REQUIRED TO CHANGE

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:10.585
POLICIES THAT CREATE AIR

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:12.053
POLLUTION IMPACTS AND THAT'S

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.187
ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR LAND USE

01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:15.623
POLICIES THAT CAN INADVERTENTLY

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:17.792
CAUSE NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES.

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:19.193
IN TERMS OF AUTHORITY THE

01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.561
DISTRICT --

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.430
CAN PROVIDE INCENTIVES WE DO

01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:24.098
ENFORCE MOBILE SOURCE

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:26.200
REGULATIONS WITH THROUGH AMMO

01:28:26.267 --> 01:28:27.735
USE WITH CARMEN --

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:29.637
BUT IT MADE US BUT WE CAN'T SET

01:28:29.704 --> 01:28:30.805
REGULATIONS FOR THEM.

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:32.173
ON THIS MAY NOT BE AS CRITICAL

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.143
FOR OTHER A BUT IN WEST OAKLAND

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:36.544
MOBILE SOURCES TO ACCOUNT FOR A

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:38.746
LARGE PORTION OF THE POLLUTION.

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:39.647
AND SO WE ARE GOING TO BE

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:41.382
EXPLORING ANY NEW WAYS THAT WE

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:42.884
CAN ADDRESS EMISSIONS FROM THESE

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:45.286
SOURCES.

01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:46.621
ALSO ENFORCEMENT REMAINS A

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:48.122
CHALLENGE FOR THE STEERING

01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:49.590
COMMITTEE MEMBERS SOME

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:51.025
ACTIVITIES DON'T NECESSARILY

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:52.360
NEED A THRESHOLD FOR NEEDING

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:53.995
THEIR DISTRICT PERMIT BUT THEY

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:56.064
STILL ARE NUISANCES OR AIR

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:57.298
QUALITY NUISANCES TO THE

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:58.166
COMMUNITY.

01:28:58.232 --> 01:28:59.233
AND THAT MIGHT INCLUDE THINGS

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.602
LIKE TRASH BURNING A RESTAURANT

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.371
SMOKING WOOD BURNING.

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.273
IN TERMS OF THE LAST CHALLENGE

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:06.107
WHICH HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT A

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:07.742
BIT ARE THE TIGHT TIME ONCE OF

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:07.975
THIS --

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.744
PROCESS THERE ARE LEGAL

01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.112
REQUIREMENTS OF COMPLYING WITH

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.447
SEQUEL THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:14.148
IDENTIFY STRATEGIES EARLY SO

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:16.117
THAT WE CAN HAVE SEVERAL PUBLIC

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.418
COMMENT PERIODS ON IT.

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:18.820
THERE IS ALSO THE NEED FOR THE

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:20.088
AIR DISTRICT TO DEVELOP THE

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:21.122
RELATIONSHIP ITH OUR NEW

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.657
COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND TO FIGURE

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:24.292
OUT HOW WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:25.560
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:26.794
WE ALSO NEEDED TO CREATE THE

01:29:26.861 --> 01:29:27.995
STEERING COMMITTEE AS WELL AS

01:29:28.062 --> 01:29:28.996
BUILD THEIR KNOWLEDGE SO THEY

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:31.265
COULD PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INPUT

01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:32.633
INTO THE PROCESS.

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.068
AND THEN ALSO WE TYPICALLY USE A

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:35.436
REGIONAL LANDS FOR ADDRESSING

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:37.472
AIR POLLUTION BUT AB SIX

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:38.139
SEVENTEEN REQUIRED A NEW

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:39.507
APPROACH TO ITS TECHNICAL

01:29:39.574 --> 01:29:40.508
ASSESSMENT WORK.

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:41.909
BY CREATING A COMMUNITY LEVEL

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:43.711
INVENTORY AND MODELING AT THE

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:45.847
NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL.

01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:46.481
AND THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:48.549
AMOUNT OF EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:49.550
COORDINATION I THINK MISS

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:50.752
MARKETS GOING TO TALK A LITTLE

01:29:50.818 --> 01:29:53.454
BIT MORE ABOUT THAT.

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:55.690
SO I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP AND AND

01:29:55.757 --> 01:29:57.258
START TALKING ABOUT RICHMOND.

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:58.326
RICHMOND IS A COMPLICATED

01:29:58.392 --> 01:29:59.627
SITUATION AS YOU CAN SEE FROM

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:01.262
THIS MAP WE'VE GOT A VERY LARGE

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:02.764
REFINERY THERE.

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:04.632
A PORT.

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:07.001
SEVERAL FREEWAYS MANY --

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:10.538
RAILROAD LINES AND ALSO A VERY

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:11.639
VALUABLE POPULATION.

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:13.374
WHAT ONE OF THE THE THINGS HAVE

01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:14.909
BEEN PUZZLING US ABOUT RICHMOND

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:16.477
IS WITH ALL THE SOURCES?

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:17.645
AND THE KIND OF HEALTH OUTCOMES

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:19.280
WERE SEEING THEIR IT DOESN'T

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:20.982
REALLY MATCH WITH THAT

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:22.416
MONITORING DATA SO FAR.

01:30:22.483 --> 01:30:24.085
SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WERE

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:26.420
EITHER NOT MONITOR --

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:28.022
TRYING FOR THE RIGHT THINGS AND

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.290
SO THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO START

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:31.325
OUT WITH A MONITORING PLAN IN

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:32.226
RICHMOND.

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:33.961
NOW RICHMOND WILL ALSO BENEFIT

01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:35.163
QUITE A BIT FROM THE BEST

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:36.731
AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:38.199
TECHNOLOGY WORK THAT WE'RE DOING.

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:39.400
A LOT OF THOSE ARE GOING TO

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:41.936
FOCUS ON REFINERY EFFORTS AND

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:42.937
THEN --

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:44.972
REGULATION ELEVEN EIGHTEEN AIR

01:30:45.039 --> 01:30:46.440
TOXICS RULE WILL ALSO HAVE A

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:47.675
SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT IN RICHMOND

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:49.010
IS GONNA BE A NUMBER OF

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:50.745
FACILITIES THERE SUBJECT TO THAT

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:51.412
RULE.

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:52.547
SO WHILE WE'RE PUTTING THE

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:53.881
MONITORING PLAN TOGETHER FOR

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:54.849
RICHMOND WE'RE GONNA

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:56.217
SIMULTANEOUSLY BE REDUCING

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.919
EMISSIONS THROUGH A REGULATORY

01:30:57.985 --> 01:30:59.620
AUTHORITY AND OUR INCENTIVE

01:30:59.687 --> 01:31:02.390
PROGRAM.

01:31:02.456 --> 01:31:05.226
SO AS JACK ALLUDED TO BEFORE THE

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:06.861
THE COMMUNITY GETTING THE

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.696
COMMUNITY PROCESS RIGHT IS

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:10.565
REALLY OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:12.200
IN EACH OF THESE COMMUNITIES.

01:31:12.266 --> 01:31:14.735
AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES IT TOUGH

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:16.270
TO MEET THE TIME LINES THAT ARE

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.905
IN THE STATUTE THE TIME LINES

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:19.207
THAT ARE IN CARBS BLUEPRINTS.

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:20.174
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SHORT

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:22.677
CIRCUIT THE COMMUNITY PROCESS.

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:24.512
AND SO IN RICHMOND WE DIDN'T

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:27.014
HAVE A READY PARTNER LIKE WE HAD

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:29.050
IN WEST OAKLAND THERE ARE A LOT

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:30.484
OF WONDERFUL VERY IMPACTFUL

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:32.353
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.221
RICHMOND.

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:35.189
BUT THOSE THAT ARE FOCUSED ON

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.958
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:40.528
PARTICULAR WERE NOT ABLE OR NOT --

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:41.762
COULD NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:43.497
TAKE ON THAT LEADERSHIP ROLE

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:44.866
THAT WE HAD IN WEST OAKLAND.

01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:47.301
SO THROUGH A SERIES OF MANY

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:48.369
MEETINGS AND MANY COMMUNITY

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:50.571
MEETINGS WE CAME UP WITH A

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:52.874
DESIGN TEAM AND THAT DESIGN TEAM.

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:55.543
DESIGNED A COMMUNITY SUMMIT AND

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:57.245
THE COMMUNITY SUMMIT LAID OUT

01:31:57.311 --> 01:31:59.513
THE STRUCTURE FOR HOW THE

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:00.081
COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEE

01:32:00.147 --> 01:32:01.249
WOULD BE.

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:05.786
WOULD BE NAMED AND SO --

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:07.855
THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.590
MISTER ROBINSON FOR RICHMOND

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:10.191
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:11.225
ABOUT THAT --

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:14.896
IN A FEW MINUTES.

01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:16.430
SO THIS TO GIVE YOU KIND OF A

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:19.166
PICTURE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF

01:32:19.233 --> 01:32:21.102
IMPLEMENTING AB SIX SEVENTEEN

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:22.270
WITH TO COMMUNITIES.

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.071
YOU CAN SEE THAT FOR EACH

01:32:24.138 --> 01:32:26.173
QUARTER WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.475
ACTIVITIES GOING ON BOTH IN THE

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:29.010
WEST OAKLAND SIDE AND ON THE

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:31.612
RICHMOND SIDE.

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.814
AND THE IN ONE OF THE STRUGGLES

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:35.016
THAT WE'VE HAD AS I MENTIONED

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:37.018
BEFORE IS.

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.085
IT'S CRITICAL TO GET THE

01:32:38.152 --> 01:32:39.353
COMMUNITY PROCESS RIGHT IT'S

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.988
CRITICAL TO GET COME TO THAT

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:42.023
UNDERSTANDING THAT LEVEL OF

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:42.556
TRUST.

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:44.292
AND TO HAVE THAT TRUE

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:45.860
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY.

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:47.862
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT AND MEET

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:49.297
THE TIME LINES HAS BEEN A

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:50.698
CHALLENGE EVEN IN WEST OAKLAND

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:52.166
AND IT'S GOOD PARTICULAR GOING

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:53.935
TO BE A CHALLENGE IN RICHMOND.

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.836
AND JET WHEN JACKETS HIS

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:57.405
CONCLUDING REMARKS FOR A TALK

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:58.039
ABOUT A PROPOSAL WE'D LIKE TO

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:00.408
MAKE TO IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE OF

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:02.944
AB. SIX SEVENTEEN TO TO ALLOW

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:05.680
MORE TIME FOR THOSE COMMUNITY

01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:08.849
PROCESSES.

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:09.951

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:13.358
NOPE WHERE DISTRICTS MUST BE

02:17:15.026 --> 02:17:16.394
THERE DISTRICTS MUST BE HELD

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:18.063

INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION.

02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:28.039
AS IN THE CASE OF OUR DISTRICT

02:17:28.106 --> 02:17:29.674
THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT IS

02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:31.409
THROWN BY OUR MIDDLE JUSTICE

02:17:31.476 --> 02:17:32.711
ORGANIZATIONAL PARTNERSHIP.

02:17:32.777 --> 02:17:34.813

02:17:36.448 --> 02:17:38.450
WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A MAJOR

02:17:38.516 --> 02:17:40.285
KEY TO SUCCESS AND THE PROGRAM.

THROUGH AB SIX SEVENTEEN PROCESS.

02:17:44.522 --> 02:17:46.891
FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE OR ACCEPT

02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:47.259
THIS REALITY IS

02:17:47.325 --> 02:17:48.393
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:49.828
AND SIMPLY CONTRADICTS THE

02:17:49.894 --> 02:17:51.496
PROGRAM'S MISSION.

02:17:51.563 --> 02:17:52.931
IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE WAY

02:17:57.902 --> 02:18:00.438

02:19:22.954 --> 02:19:24.756
FROM MOVING TO THE OTHER AND

02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:26.658
THAT'S TAKEN A LOT OF WORK --

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:27.892
TO COME TOGETHER OF COURSE OF

02:19:27.959 --> 02:19:29.527

FRONT BRINGING THIS TOGETHER I

02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:36.701
THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE A

02:19:36.768 --> 02:19:39.370
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE REGION.

02:19:39.437 --> 02:19:40.939
A REGION THAT --

02:19:41.005 --> 02:19:42.907
UNFORTUNATELY STATISTIC THAT

02:19:42.974 --> 02:19:44.476
PART TOO LONG HAS TO BE

02:19:44.542 --> 02:19:46.177
MENTIONED THAT. SEVEN OUT OF TEN

02:19:46.244 --> 02:19:48.146
CHILDREN SUFFER FROM RESPIRATORY

02:19:48.213 --> 02:19:48.747
DISEASE PROBLEMS ALL OF THESE

02:19:48.813 --> 02:19:49.547
EFFORTS.

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:51.616
ARE UNDERWAY OURS EXTREMELY

02:19:51.683 --> 02:19:53.118
IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC.

02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:56.521

02:19:56.588 --> 02:19:58.957
FOR MR DESERT NEED.

02:19:59.023 --> 02:19:59.524
MENTIONED.

02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:01.025
THIS IN PASSING.

02:20:01.092 --> 02:20:02.527
THE REVIEW OF THE AG BURNING

02:20:02.594 --> 02:20:04.295
POLICY FOR THE AIR DISTRICT I'M

02:20:04.362 --> 02:20:06.264
I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:08.700
ABOUT THAT IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A

02:20:08.767 --> 02:20:09.367
FEW MINUTES TO JUST KIND OF GIVE

02:20:09.434 --> 02:20:11.002
US A AN OVERVIEW FOR FOLKS TO

02:20:11.069 --> 02:20:12.537
UNDERSTAND BOTH LOCALLY AS WELL

02:20:12.604 --> 02:20:13.805
AS THE WHITE.

02:20:13.872 --> 02:20:14.973
THAT THIS IS A PRACTICE THAT

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:16.474
CONTINUES --

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:18.643
IN THIS REGION AND SOMETHING

02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:20.612
THAT ALWAYS IS BROUGHT UP BY

02:20:20.678 --> 02:20:22.213
MANY CONSTITUENTS --

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:24.716
IN FACT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:26.184
WIDE [inaudible]

02:20:26.251 --> 02:20:29.988
OR WHY THERE ARE MORE --

02:20:30.054 --> 02:20:31.422
EFFORTS TO REDUCE IT AND I THINK

02:20:31.489 --> 02:20:33.658
PART OF IT IS PEOPLE NOT KNOWING

02:20:33.725 --> 02:20:35.226
WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING AT THE

WE LOOK FOR THE RIGHT TYPE OF

02:20:57.282 --> 02:20:58.917

02:21:24.676 --> 02:21:26.211
THAT MEXICO GETS AN APPETITE FOR

02:21:26.277 --> 02:21:27.745
SOME OF THAT AND THE FIRST STEP

02:21:27.812 --> 02:21:29.647

02:21:29.714 --> 02:21:31.316
WOULD BE AN ACT BURN PROGRAM.

02:21:31.382 --> 02:21:32.617
AND THAT FIRST BABY STEP WITHIN

02:21:32.684 --> 02:21:35.220
pSTOP BURNING THEIR FIELDS AT

02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:48.933
DUTY TRUCK ENGINES.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.169
WE ALSO LOOK AT OFF ROAD ENGINES

02:26:51.235 --> 02:26:52.570
A MARINE ENGINES.

02:26:52.637 --> 02:26:53.771
AND OTHERS.

02:26:53.838 --> 02:26:55.339
I WOULD SAY THAT ASA RESULT OF

02:26:55.406 --> 02:26:57.608
AB SIX SEVENTEEN BE REALLY TRIED

02:26:57.675 --> 02:26:59.143
TO ENHANCE.

02:26:59.210 --> 02:27:01.345
THE AWARENESS THROUGH CARL MOYER

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:02.680
AND I WOULD SAY THAT AS A DIRECT

02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:05.550
RESULT OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN WE'VE

02:27:05.616 --> 02:27:06.784
ALREADY SEEN A THREE FOLD

02:27:06.851 --> 02:27:10.354
RESPONSE. TO SOLICITATIONS

02:27:10.421 --> 02:27:12.456
THROUGH THE CAR MORE PROGRAM.

02:27:12.523 --> 02:27:14.225
WE'VE ALSO EMBARKED ON AN

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:17.862
EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF COMMUNITIES

02:27:17.929 --> 02:27:19.397
AS A RB DESCRIBE --

02:27:19.463 --> 02:27:20.865
WE LOOKED AT ALMOST A HUNDRED

02:27:20.932 --> 02:27:22.600
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES LOOKED AT

02:27:22.667 --> 02:27:24.302
A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FACTORS.

02:27:24.368 --> 02:27:27.171
INCLUDING PROXIMITY OF SOURCES

02:27:27.238 --> 02:27:29.407
TO UTILIZING CAL ENVIRO SCREEN

02:27:29.473 --> 02:27:31.409
LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP OF

02:27:31.475 --> 02:27:34.445
SOURCES TO A SPECIAL.

02:27:34.512 --> 02:27:35.846
OF POPULATIONS.

02:27:35.913 --> 02:27:37.081
AND SO THERE WAS A NUMBER OF

02:27:37.148 --> 02:27:38.516
DIFFERENT ACTIONS THAT WE DID

02:27:38.583 --> 02:27:39.850
AND FINALLY ON THE PARK RULES

02:27:39.917 --> 02:27:40.585
UPDATE.

02:27:40.651 --> 02:27:43.754
REMOVING VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO OF

02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:45.623
PHASE OUT REKLAME AND INSTITUTE

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:48.626
A NUMBER OF THE BAR CONTROLS.

02:27:48.693 --> 02:27:50.394
SO WITH THAT --

02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:51.729
AS I MENTIONED WE'VE ALREADY

02:27:51.796 --> 02:27:53.764
ALLOCATED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND

02:27:53.831 --> 02:27:56.167
ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROJECTS.

02:27:56.234 --> 02:27:57.835
TO REDUCE DIESEL EMISSIONS

02:27:57.902 --> 02:27:59.136
PRIMARILY.

02:27:59.203 --> 02:28:01.239
AND AS WE KNOW IT NEARLY 90% OF

02:28:01.305 --> 02:28:02.707
THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN AND

02:28:02.773 --> 02:28:04.141
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

02:28:04.208 --> 02:28:05.343
AND THIRTY MILLION OF THOSE

02:28:05.409 --> 02:28:07.678
FUNDS HAVE BEEN IN AB SIX

02:28:07.745 --> 02:28:08.512
SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES.

02:28:08.579 --> 02:28:09.947
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE

02:28:10.014 --> 02:28:11.449
BECAUSE THE FIRST YEAR OF

02:28:11.515 --> 02:28:13.584
FUNDING WAS REALLY DONE BEFORE

02:28:13.651 --> 02:28:16.354
THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SIX

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:17.355
SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES.

02:28:17.421 --> 02:28:19.090
AND THAT GETS TO THE ABILITY OF

02:28:19.156 --> 02:28:20.625
THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY

02:28:20.691 --> 02:28:21.926
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT.

02:28:21.993 --> 02:28:23.594
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN IN NON

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:25.162
ATTAINMENT STATUS FOR SO LONG

02:28:25.229 --> 02:28:26.530
IT'S DEVELOPED AIR QUALITY

02:28:26.597 --> 02:28:28.466
MANAGEMENT PLANS AND THOSE AIR

02:28:28.532 --> 02:28:29.700
QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLANS.

02:28:29.767 --> 02:28:32.136
OR THE BLUEPRINT FOR HOW WE HOPE

02:28:32.203 --> 02:28:33.504
TO COME INTO ATTAINMENT.

02:28:33.571 --> 02:28:37.541
ANNA DESCRIBES IN A WAY THAT.

02:28:37.608 --> 02:28:38.976
THE FACT THAT WE NOW KNOW WE

02:28:39.043 --> 02:28:41.078
HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY WE KNOW THAT

02:28:41.145 --> 02:28:42.580
WE CAN REDUCE CRITERIA

02:28:42.647 --> 02:28:44.482
POLLUTANTS AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S

02:28:44.548 --> 02:28:45.816
EXPENSIVE.

02:28:45.883 --> 02:28:47.885
AND SO THE CHALLENGE IS HOW DO

02:28:47.952 --> 02:28:49.887
WE HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE AND

02:28:49.954 --> 02:28:52.156
MAXIMIZE THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS.

02:28:52.223 --> 02:28:54.025
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY

02:28:54.091 --> 02:28:55.660
THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY

02:28:55.726 --> 02:28:57.328
HAVEN'T TO PERHAPS ENJOYED THE

02:28:57.395 --> 02:28:59.063
BENEFITS OF THAT WE'VE SEEN

02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:00.164
THROUGH.

02:29:00.231 --> 02:29:01.465
A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

02:29:01.532 --> 02:29:02.633
REDUCTIONS IN CLIMATE

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:03.734
INVESTMENTS.

02:29:03.801 --> 02:29:05.102
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:29:05.169 --> 02:29:07.271
WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE PARTICULAR

02:29:07.338 --> 02:29:09.874
ASPECTS.

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:12.276
AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED WITHIN THE

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:13.344
SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY

02:29:13.411 --> 02:29:14.712
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WE HAVE

02:29:14.779 --> 02:29:16.113
THREE COMMUNITIES.

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:18.416
WE HAVE ROAMING TEN CARS IN WEST

02:29:18.482 --> 02:29:19.784
LONG BEACH.

02:29:19.850 --> 02:29:21.419
WE ALSO HAVE SAN BERNADINO AND

02:29:21.485 --> 02:29:22.620
MY SCHOOL LIKE.

02:29:22.687 --> 02:29:23.487
AND THEN WE HAVE THE BOYLE

02:29:23.554 --> 02:29:25.923
HEIGHTS IS LOS ANGELES WEST

02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.657
COMMERCE.

02:29:26.724 --> 02:29:28.292
THIS IS UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT

02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:30.594
IT'S REALLY MUCH MORE THAN JUST

02:29:30.661 --> 02:29:32.663
ONE COMMUNITY IT'S A NUMBER OF

02:29:32.730 --> 02:29:33.698
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES.

02:29:33.764 --> 02:29:35.533
AND WE FELT THAT FROM A REGIONAL

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:36.967
PERSPECTIVE.

02:29:37.034 --> 02:29:39.737
OF THAT NATURE OF THE SOURCES OF

02:29:39.804 --> 02:29:41.172
THE GOODS MOVEMENT ASPECT.

02:29:41.238 --> 02:29:44.075
THAT IT WAS MUCH PREFERABLE FOR

02:29:44.141 --> 02:29:46.711
US TO SORT OF TAKE A LARGER.

02:29:46.777 --> 02:29:48.579
VIEW IF YOU WILL OF THESE

02:29:48.646 --> 02:29:50.147
COMMUNITIES AND WE WANT TO TRY

02:29:50.214 --> 02:29:51.949
TO MAXIMIZE THE RESULTS WITHIN

02:29:52.016 --> 02:29:53.017
THOSE COMMUNITIES.

02:29:53.084 --> 02:29:54.385
SO THAT'S WHY YOU SORT OF SEE

02:29:54.452 --> 02:29:55.853
THAT IT'S NOT JUST ONE

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:57.188
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY.

02:29:57.254 --> 02:29:59.423
BUT RATHER A SIMULATION OF A

02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:01.759
MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES CITIES

02:30:01.826 --> 02:30:03.327
LOCALITIES AROUND THAT AREA

02:30:03.394 --> 02:30:03.627
[inaudible]

02:30:03.694 --> 02:30:05.329
AND SO.

02:30:05.396 --> 02:30:07.465
I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO DR

02:30:07.531 --> 02:30:08.699
GOSH -- TO

02:30:08.766 --> 02:30:09.900
DESCRIBE ABOUT THE ACTUAL

02:30:09.967 --> 02:30:11.402
EFFORTS THAT WE'VE BEEN LEADING

02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:13.471
ON THE GROUND.

02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:14.372
THANK YOU --

FORMED A COMMUNITY STEERING

COMMITTEES FOR EACH OF THESE

02:30:24.782 --> 02:30:26.016
COMMUNITIES.

02:30:26.083 --> 02:30:27.251
THE PURPOSE OF THESE COMMITTEES --

02:30:27.318 --> 02:30:29.220
WAS TO HELP US IDENTIFY AND

02:30:33.023 --> 02:30:34.158
THE STRATEGIES THAT WILL BE

02:30:34.225 --> 02:30:36.560
WRITTEN INTO THE COMMUNITY PLANS.

WORKERS --

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:58.349
WE ACTUALLY WORKED REALLY HARD

02:30:58.416 --> 02:31:00.418
TO ENGAGE LAND USE AGENCIES AND

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:02.086
WE DO HAVE A LAND USE H.

02:31:02.153 --> 02:31:03.687
AGENCIES REPRESENTED ON ALL

02:31:03.754 --> 02:31:05.389

HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING SO WE FIRST

02:31:15.166 --> 02:31:16.901
STARTED BY IDENTIFYING THE

02:31:16.967 --> 02:31:18.969
COMMUNITY AIR QUALITY CONCERNS

02:31:19.036 --> 02:31:20.371

DEVELOP THE MEASURES AND THE

02:31:44.261 --> 02:31:45.529
SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT WILL BE

LOCOMOTIVES OTHER EQUIPMENT AS

02:39:48.912 --> 02:39:51.248
WELL AS THE TRACKS THAT THE THAT

02:39:51.315 --> 02:39:52.249
THE RAIL YARD --

02:39:52.316 --> 02:39:52.849
SOME ADDITIONAL HIGH PRIORITY

I WE PRESENTED.

02:40:04.695 --> 02:40:07.364
A SUITE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIES --

02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:08.398
THAT WE CAN --

02:40:08.465 --> 02:40:10.233
USE IN THE COMMUNITY IN WRITING

02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:12.135
THE COMMUNITY PLANS VERTICALLY

02:40:12.202 --> 02:40:14.204
FOR THE EMISSION REDUCTION PLANS

02:40:14.271 --> 02:40:15.739
BUT I ALSO THE AIR MONITORING

02:40:15.806 --> 02:40:17.374
PLANS SO THIS INCLUDES --

02:40:17.441 --> 02:40:20.544
DEVELOPING REGULATIONS.

02:40:20.610 --> 02:40:21.411
IT OF DIFFERENT INCENTIVE

02:40:21.478 --> 02:40:24.381
PROGRAMS USING A MONITORING --

02:40:24.448 --> 02:40:26.016
IN A VERY TARGETED FASHION TO

02:40:26.083 --> 02:40:27.918
HELP ADDRESS THESE A COMMUNITY

UP ON ANY THAT FOLLOW UP ON THE

02:40:37.761 --> 02:40:39.162
RESULTS OF MONITORING WITH

02:40:39.229 --> 02:40:41.031
ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT --

02:40:41.098 --> 02:40:43.000
WE'VE ALSO DISCUSSED THE

02:40:43.066 --> 02:40:44.334
DIFFERENT TYPES OF OUTREACH

02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:45.969
PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED

02:40:46.036 --> 02:40:47.871
AS PART OF THESE PLANS --

02:40:47.938 --> 02:40:49.873
A WE ARE TRYING TO ACTIVELY

02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:51.208
COLLABORATE WITH A VARIETY OF

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:52.909
OTHER AGENCIES INCLUDING PUBLIC

02:40:52.976 --> 02:40:54.378
HEALTH AGENCIES AND LAND USE

02:40:54.444 --> 02:40:55.712
AGENCIES AND FINALLY WERE

02:40:55.779 --> 02:40:57.114
CERTAINLY ALSO CONSIDERING --

02:40:57.180 --> 02:40:59.216
EXPOSURE REDUCTION STRATEGIES AS

02:40:59.282 --> 02:41:03.286
WELL.

02:41:03.353 --> 02:41:04.554
WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:06.123
DISCUSSING IN OUR US DURING

02:41:06.189 --> 02:41:08.091
COMMITTEE MEETINGS IS REALLY HOW

02:41:08.158 --> 02:41:09.326
TO INTEGRATE THESE DIFFERENT

02:41:09.393 --> 02:41:11.194
TYPES OF STRATEGIES SO JUST AS

02:41:11.261 --> 02:41:12.662
AN EXAMPLE OUT OF THE DIESEL

02:41:12.729 --> 02:41:14.131
TRUCK EMISSIONS CAME UP AS A

02:41:14.197 --> 02:41:15.265
HIGH PRIORITY IN ALL THREE OF

02:41:15.332 --> 02:41:16.266
OUR COMMUNITIES?

02:41:16.333 --> 02:41:17.267
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:41:17.334 --> 02:41:19.569
CAN DO IS USE MONITORING OR

02:41:19.636 --> 02:41:21.271
OTHER DATA TO IDENTIFY WHICH

02:41:21.338 --> 02:41:23.540
TRUCKS ARE THE FREQUENT FLYERS

02:41:23.607 --> 02:41:25.442
IN THAT IN THAT COMMUNITY.

02:41:25.509 --> 02:41:26.410
AND FROM THERE WE CAN ACTUALLY

02:41:26.476 --> 02:41:27.911
HELP TARGET OUR INCENTIVE SO

02:41:27.978 --> 02:41:29.513
THAT WE GET THE MORE GET MORE

02:41:29.579 --> 02:41:31.248
BANG FOR OUR BUCK.

02:41:31.314 --> 02:41:32.516
WE'VE ALSO --

02:41:32.582 --> 02:41:34.251
HEARD A LOT ABOUT UP A TRUCK

02:41:34.317 --> 02:41:36.319
IDLING TRUCK IDLING LOCATIONS

02:41:36.386 --> 02:41:37.287
AND WE CAN.

02:41:37.354 --> 02:41:38.655
WE CAN USE OUR TARGET

02:41:38.722 --> 02:41:39.823
ENFORCEMENT SWEEPS TO HELP

02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:41.792
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND ALSO

02:41:41.858 --> 02:41:43.794
WE'VE REACHED OUT TO OUR LAND

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:45.662
USE AGENCIES TO SEE WHAT WE CAN

02:41:45.729 --> 02:41:47.531
DO A COLLABORATIVELY WITH REGARD

02:41:47.597 --> 02:41:48.899
TO TRUCK ROUTES AND TRAFFIC

02:41:48.965 --> 02:41:50.667
SIGNAL TIMING.

02:41:50.734 --> 02:41:52.202
I WITHOUT GOING TO HEAD OFF TO

OFFICER AT SOUTH COAST FOR

02:42:02.112 --> 02:42:02.979
PLANNING AND WILL DEVELOPMENT

02:42:03.046 --> 02:42:04.681
AND IF I TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT

02:42:04.748 --> 02:42:05.849
THE A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN

02:42:05.916 --> 02:42:06.716
REQUIREMENT FOR THE BEST

02:42:06.783 --> 02:42:07.851
AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL

02:42:07.918 --> 02:42:09.453
TECHNOLOGY --

02:42:09.519 --> 02:42:10.220
FOR THE SOUTH COAST THAT

02:42:10.287 --> 02:42:11.955
REQUIREMENT TOOK ON NEW MEANING

02:42:12.022 --> 02:42:13.290
BECAUSE FOR MANY YEARS WE HAD

02:42:13.356 --> 02:42:14.825
OUR RECLAIM PROGRAM.

02:42:14.891 --> 02:42:16.359
WHICH WAS A CAP AND TRADE

02:42:16.426 --> 02:42:16.927
PROGRAM --

02:42:16.993 --> 02:42:21.098
FOR NOT NITROGEN OXIDE IN A SELF

02:42:21.164 --> 02:42:22.499
RESOURCES.

02:42:22.566 --> 02:42:23.867
ARE BOARD HAD ALREADY.

02:42:23.934 --> 02:42:26.336
ADOPTED A PLAN TO A SENSE THAT

02:42:26.403 --> 02:42:28.572
THAT PROGRAM BUT WHAT AB SIX

02:42:28.638 --> 02:42:29.606
SEVENTEEN DID IS REALLY LIGHT A

02:42:29.673 --> 02:42:31.108
FIRE UNDER OUR EFFORTS WITH THE

02:42:31.174 --> 02:42:32.275
DEADLINE --

02:42:32.342 --> 02:42:33.844
AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY

02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:34.778
THREE TO IMPLEMENT PARKED --

02:42:34.845 --> 02:42:37.347
IN OUR REGION SO WHAT TYPICALLY

02:42:37.414 --> 02:42:38.148
WE WOULD --

02:42:38.215 --> 02:42:40.150
AMEND WE CLAIM EVERY FIVE YEARS

02:42:40.217 --> 02:42:42.352
OR WORK ON PARK TOOLS FOR NON WE

02:42:42.419 --> 02:42:44.121
CLAIM SOURCES MAYBE ONE OR TWO A

02:42:44.187 --> 02:42:45.455
YEAR AS YOU CAN SEE HERE.

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:46.823
WE HAVE REALLY GONE INTO

02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:48.925
OVERDRIVE AND ARE WORKING ON A A

02:42:48.992 --> 02:42:51.027
ABOUT A DOZEN RULES IN PARALLEL

02:42:51.094 --> 02:42:52.596
TO IMPLEMENT BARKING EXCEPT ARE

02:42:52.662 --> 02:42:54.164
EX WE CLAIM FACILITIES AS A

02:42:54.231 --> 02:42:55.665
COMMODITY CLAIM.

02:42:55.732 --> 02:42:57.634
IT'S A COMPLEX PROCESS IT'S A

02:42:57.701 --> 02:42:58.935
COMPLEX PROGRAM --

02:42:59.002 --> 02:43:00.570
WE'VE ALREADY ADOPTED A SERIES

02:43:00.637 --> 02:43:02.939
OF THREE RULES ACTUALLY ONE WAS

02:43:03.006 --> 02:43:04.241
ACTUALLY THREE RULES.

02:43:04.307 --> 02:43:05.275
SO -- THREE

02:43:05.342 --> 02:43:06.977
WILL TO ADOPTED ALREADY AND THEN

02:43:07.043 --> 02:43:09.179
COMING UP THIS YEAR WE HAVE A

02:43:09.246 --> 02:43:10.347
WHOLE SERIES OF RULES THAT WE

02:43:10.413 --> 02:43:12.883
THINK WE CAN GET TO IN.

02:43:12.949 --> 02:43:13.483
TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEN A FEW

02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:15.752
MORE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO REALLY.

02:43:15.819 --> 02:43:19.156
TO REALLY REQUIRE --

02:43:19.222 --> 02:43:19.756
BARKED AT THESE FACILITIES THE

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:22.092
CAP.

02:43:22.159 --> 02:43:23.560
BARKED EQUIPMENT REDUCTIONS BUT

02:43:23.627 --> 02:43:24.861
IT DIDN'T ENSURE THAT PARTICULAR

02:43:24.928 --> 02:43:25.896
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN A

02:43:25.962 --> 02:43:27.964
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY WAS GOING

02:43:28.031 --> 02:43:28.832
TO HAVE --

02:43:28.899 --> 02:43:30.534
THE BEST AVAILABLE CONTROLS AND

02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:31.668
GOING FORWARD UNDER THIS COMMAND

02:43:31.735 --> 02:43:33.336
CONTROL STRUCTURE THAT WILL BE

02:43:33.403 --> 02:43:34.371
THE CASE.

02:43:34.437 --> 02:43:35.605
I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER --

02:43:35.672 --> 02:43:37.774
TO MISTER NASTY FOR THE FINAL

02:43:37.841 --> 02:43:39.643
SLIDE.

02:43:39.709 --> 02:43:42.445
THANKS TALK TO FIND.

02:43:42.512 --> 02:43:43.980
SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD --

02:43:44.047 --> 02:43:45.849
I CERTAINLY WANT TO ECHO THE

02:43:45.916 --> 02:43:47.417
COMMENTS THAT BAY AREA MADE WITH

02:43:47.484 --> 02:43:50.420
REGARDS TO THE LIMITED AUTHORITY --

02:43:50.487 --> 02:43:52.856
WITH REGARDS TO AS YOU KNOW

02:43:52.923 --> 02:43:54.758
DISTRICTS HAVE PRIMARY AUTHORITY

02:43:54.824 --> 02:43:56.259
OVER STATIONARY SOURCES.

02:43:56.326 --> 02:43:58.228
WELL WE CAN UTILIZE SOME OF

02:43:58.295 --> 02:43:59.696
CARBS ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY

02:43:59.763 --> 02:44:01.865
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES.

02:44:01.932 --> 02:44:04.401
TO A TRUCK ANTI IDLING EFFORTS.

02:44:04.467 --> 02:44:05.535
YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE

02:44:05.602 --> 02:44:06.870
TO DO MORE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY

02:44:06.937 --> 02:44:08.104
IN DISCUSSIONS WE WANT TO

02:44:08.171 --> 02:44:09.739
EXPLORE.

02:44:09.806 --> 02:44:11.241
HOW WE COULD SEE MORE ENHANCED

02:44:11.308 --> 02:44:13.276
ON ROAD TESTING WE WANT TO SEE

02:44:13.343 --> 02:44:15.078
HOW WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE

02:44:15.145 --> 02:44:16.746
OTHER LARGER SOURCES?

02:44:16.813 --> 02:44:18.715
WHICH AS WE KNOW OF WITH THE

02:44:18.782 --> 02:44:20.116
PORT COMPLEX.

02:44:20.183 --> 02:44:21.251
WE HAVE THE LARGEST

02:44:21.318 --> 02:44:24.054
CONTAINERIZED PART COMP AND IT'S

02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:25.956
THE ONLY SOURCE OF KNOCKS IT'S

02:44:26.022 --> 02:44:27.157
GOING TO BE GROWING OVER THE

02:44:27.224 --> 02:44:28.225
NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

02:44:28.291 --> 02:44:30.327
SO WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO

02:44:30.393 --> 02:44:31.094
REDUCE.

02:44:31.161 --> 02:44:32.729
THOSE OCEAN GOING VESSELS IN

02:44:32.796 --> 02:44:33.964
ORDER.

02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:35.999
TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IN THE PORT

02:44:36.066 --> 02:44:38.768
AREA AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO

02:44:38.835 --> 02:44:40.136
REDUCE EMISSIONS TO ACHIEVE.

02:44:40.203 --> 02:44:41.238
ATTAINMENT.

02:44:41.304 --> 02:44:43.306
WE ALSO FACE WITH THAT PERSONNEL

02:44:43.373 --> 02:44:46.343
CHALLENGES MANY OF THE DISTRICTS --

02:44:46.409 --> 02:44:48.878
AND AGENCIES ARE FACED WITH THE

02:44:48.945 --> 02:44:51.481
LARGE NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS AND

02:44:51.548 --> 02:44:53.350
SO WE'RE ALL COMPETING FOR THE

02:44:53.416 --> 02:44:54.985
SAME PERSONNEL PULL TO HIRE

02:44:55.051 --> 02:44:56.519
PEOPLE SO THAT WE CAN MOVE MORE

02:44:56.586 --> 02:44:57.754
QUICKLY.

02:44:57.821 --> 02:44:59.389
THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE NEW

02:44:59.456 --> 02:45:00.557
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OFTEN

02:45:00.624 --> 02:45:02.892
NECESSARY. TO DISPLACE THE OLDER

02:45:02.959 --> 02:45:05.395
TECHNOLOGY IS FAIRLY EXPENSIVE.

02:45:05.462 --> 02:45:07.030
AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE

02:45:07.097 --> 02:45:07.664
BEEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:45:07.731 --> 02:45:08.265
HEAR.

02:45:08.331 --> 02:45:10.033
A QUITE OFTEN IS THAT WE WANT TO

02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:12.435
PURSUE ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY.

02:45:12.502 --> 02:45:14.738
YET HOW CAN WE GO FOUR ZERO

02:45:14.804 --> 02:45:15.939
EMISSION TECHNOLOGY IF WE DON'T

02:45:16.006 --> 02:45:18.308
NECESSARILY HAVE THE FUNDS AND

02:45:18.375 --> 02:45:20.010
IS THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF READY

02:45:20.076 --> 02:45:21.511
THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT.

02:45:21.578 --> 02:45:23.280
WE ASK OURSELVES WE CERTAINLY

02:45:23.346 --> 02:45:24.047
AGREE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY IS

02:45:24.114 --> 02:45:26.349
READY CAN BE DEPLOYED IN CAN BE

02:45:26.416 --> 02:45:27.684
SUPPORTED IT SHOULD BE.

02:45:27.751 --> 02:45:29.686
WORD ISN'T CAN WE GET EMISSION

02:45:29.753 --> 02:45:31.354
REDUCTIONS THROUGH OTHER MEANS I

02:45:31.421 --> 02:45:32.889
THINK THOSE ARE PART OF THE

02:45:32.956 --> 02:45:34.291
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE COMING A

02:45:34.357 --> 02:45:35.925
HEAD.

02:45:35.992 --> 02:45:36.960
AS WELL AS THE OVERALL TIMING.

02:45:37.027 --> 02:45:40.930
MOVING FOR A IN A WAY THAT ALSO

02:45:40.997 --> 02:45:42.532
HAS EXTENSIVE PUBLIC PROCESS

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:45.035
SOMETIMES THE TWO AREN'T --

02:45:45.101 --> 02:45:47.337
COMPATIBLE AND IN ORDER TO HAVE

AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THAT

02:45:53.076 --> 02:45:54.444

02:45:56.846 --> 02:45:57.847
TIME.

WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND

02:45:59.282 --> 02:46:00.884
APPRECIATE THAT DESIRE BUT WE

02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:02.385
ALSO UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE THAT.

02:46:02.452 --> 02:46:04.521
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE FOR FAR

02:46:04.587 --> 02:46:05.288

OUR AIR BE AND THE AIR DISTRICTS

02:47:03.613 --> 02:47:06.983
REDUCTIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S MOST

02:47:07.050 --> 02:47:08.251
POLLUTION BURN COMMUNITIES.

02:47:08.318 --> 02:47:09.319
AB SIX SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENTATIONS

02:47:09.386 --> 02:47:11.154
ON TRACK I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR

02:47:11.221 --> 02:47:12.021
THAT.

02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:14.657
BUT FIRST I FEEL WE MUST ASK

02:47:14.724 --> 02:47:15.158
BEFORE ASKING THE RIGHT

02:47:15.225 --> 02:47:17.060
QUESTIONS.

02:47:17.127 --> 02:47:17.727
I KNOW FIRST TACKLE THE QUESTION

02:47:17.794 --> 02:47:19.629
BY REMOVING THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN

02:47:19.696 --> 02:47:21.197
LEAD.

02:47:21.264 --> 02:47:23.299
WHAT I WANNA KNOW?

02:47:23.366 --> 02:47:25.301
IS WHERE IS THE HEARING.

02:47:25.368 --> 02:47:27.170
ON IS CALIFORNIA STATE

02:47:27.237 --> 02:47:30.073
LEGISLATURE ON TRACK TO DELIVER

02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:30.940
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS

02:47:31.007 --> 02:47:32.142
CALIFORNIA'S MOST POLLUTION

02:47:32.208 --> 02:47:34.210
BRING COMMUNITIES.

02:47:34.277 --> 02:47:34.811
I'D LOVE TO COME BACK FOR THAT

02:47:34.878 --> 02:47:36.179
HEARING.

02:47:36.246 --> 02:47:37.680
BUT ON A SERIOUS NOW.

02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:39.249
WE ARE ASKING US TO DO TODAY IS

02:47:39.315 --> 02:47:40.417
TO TELL YOU ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT

02:47:40.483 --> 02:47:41.451
EXIST.

02:47:41.518 --> 02:47:42.819
AND CERTAINLY SINCE IT DOES

02:47:42.886 --> 02:47:45.422
EXIST THE COMMITMENT THAT THE

02:47:45.488 --> 02:47:46.956
STATE HAS MADE MUST BE FULFILLED.

02:47:47.023 --> 02:47:48.892
BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY TRULY

02:47:48.958 --> 02:47:50.093
GETS THROUGH THE ISSUE RIGHT AND

02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:52.262
I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER AB

02:47:52.328 --> 02:47:53.663
SIX SEVENTEEN HAS A CONTEXT IN

02:47:53.730 --> 02:47:56.232
WHICH IT EXIST --

02:47:56.299 --> 02:47:59.602
BECAME ABOUT AS AT COMPROMISED.

02:47:59.669 --> 02:48:01.371
AND AB THREE NINETY IS THE CAP

02:48:01.438 --> 02:48:02.505
AND TRADE EXTENSION ARE

02:48:02.572 --> 02:48:04.340
MECHANISM IN THE STATE TO REDUCE

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:06.109
EMISSIONS BUT IT'S PROVEN OVER

02:48:06.176 --> 02:48:06.943
AND OVER AGAIN.

02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:09.379
NOT TO WORK TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

02:48:09.446 --> 02:48:10.947
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:48:11.014 --> 02:48:13.616
AND NOR THE STATE NOW OUR RATE

02:48:13.683 --> 02:48:15.785
OF REDUCTIONS HAD INVERTED.

02:48:15.852 --> 02:48:17.220
AND WE'RE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET

02:48:17.287 --> 02:48:18.221
TARGETS.

02:48:18.288 --> 02:48:20.557
ALSO WE KNOW WILD FIRES ARE

02:48:20.623 --> 02:48:23.293
GOING TO CONTINUE TO JEOPARDIZE

02:48:23.359 --> 02:48:25.128
NOT ONLY OUR LIVES.

02:48:25.195 --> 02:48:26.463
BUT OUR ABILITY TO MEET

02:48:26.529 --> 02:48:28.565
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS EVERYTHING

02:48:28.631 --> 02:48:29.699
WE'VE MITIGATED I RACED BY

02:48:29.766 --> 02:48:31.935
WILDFIRES THEN THERE WAS THE

02:48:32.001 --> 02:48:33.970
LITTLE NOT SO LITTLE REPORT THAT

02:48:34.037 --> 02:48:34.671
CAME OUT LAST FALL WHICH

02:48:34.737 --> 02:48:35.438
REMINDED US.

02:48:35.505 --> 02:48:36.639
OUR TIMELINE TO SOLVE THIS

02:48:36.706 --> 02:48:38.308
PROBLEM IS MUCH CLOSER THAN IT

02:48:38.374 --> 02:48:39.409
APPEARED.

02:48:39.476 --> 02:48:40.543
KIND OF LIKE A REAR VIEW MIRROR

02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:41.911
IN A CAR.

02:48:41.978 --> 02:48:43.279
BUT UNLIKE REVIEW MEARS WE CAN'T

02:48:43.346 --> 02:48:44.781
LOOK BACKWARDS EVER GOING TO GET

02:48:44.848 --> 02:48:45.648
THE REDUCTIONS IN OUR

02:48:45.715 --> 02:48:46.983
COMMUNITIES AND STATE.

02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:51.120
THE POINT WE NEED MORE

02:48:51.187 --> 02:48:51.688
AGGRESSIVE NOT ACTION NOW.

02:48:51.754 --> 02:48:53.256
I KNOW THIS IS NOT NEWS TO ANY

02:48:53.323 --> 02:48:55.091
OF YOU ARE COMMUNITIES AND ARE

02:48:55.158 --> 02:48:56.793

02:48:56.860 --> 02:48:58.461
BEATING THIS TRAUMA ALL ALONG.

02:48:58.528 --> 02:49:00.330
AND EVEN TO THE MEMBERS IN THIS

02:49:00.396 --> 02:49:01.564
COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT

02:49:01.631 --> 02:49:02.866
PRESENT TODAY.

02:49:02.932 --> 02:49:04.501
DO NOT SUPPORT THE FALSE PREMISE

02:49:04.567 --> 02:49:06.536
THAT WITHOUT CAP AND TRADE WE

02:49:06.603 --> 02:49:08.071
HAVE NO PROGRAM FOR THE STATE

02:49:08.137 --> 02:49:08.972
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE

02:49:09.038 --> 02:49:11.307
NATIONAL MAY BE EVEN GLOBAL

02:49:11.374 --> 02:49:13.843
LEADER ON CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT

02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:17.480
ALSO ENCOURAGES ECONOMIC GROWTH --

02:49:17.547 --> 02:49:18.081
I WAS GOING TO REACH OF THEIR

02:49:18.147 --> 02:49:22.285
STATEMENTS TO NOT SUPPORT AB --

02:49:22.352 --> 02:49:23.119
THREE NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE THEY

02:49:23.186 --> 02:49:25.421
KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT IT SAYS BUT

02:49:25.488 --> 02:49:27.423
I'LL JUST SUMMARIZE WITH --

02:49:27.490 --> 02:49:28.491
ONE THERE WERE SOME MEMBER MARK

02:49:28.558 --> 02:49:29.459

MEMBER LEGAL STATEMENT HE SAID.

02:49:38.101 --> 02:49:38.835
I LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF THE CAP

02:49:38.902 --> 02:49:39.736
AND TRADE MECHANISM WHAT

02:49:39.802 --> 02:49:41.371

02:49:44.574 --> 02:49:46.309
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT.

02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:48.077
BUT THE BILL FELL SHORT OF

02:49:48.144 --> 02:49:50.413
PROVIDING SUCH EVIDENCE.

02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:51.180
AND TO THE OTHER COMMITTEE

PREDICAMENT YOU WERE IN AT THE

02:49:53.683 --> 02:49:54.984
TIME -- AND

02:49:55.051 --> 02:49:56.219
I WORK FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT

02:49:56.286 --> 02:49:57.921
ALSO AT THE TIME UNFORTUNATELY

02:49:57.987 --> 02:49:59.422
MADE THE SAME DECISION TO

02:49:59.489 --> 02:50:00.890
SUPPORT THIS PACKAGE OF BILLS AT

02:50:00.957 --> 02:50:01.891

02:50:07.864 --> 02:50:08.498
DO.

02:50:08.565 --> 02:50:10.266
AND ARE READY TO TAKE BOLD

02:50:10.333 --> 02:50:12.201
ACTION TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF

02:50:12.268 --> 02:50:13.369
RADICAL REDUCTION OF THE

02:50:13.436 --> 02:50:15.238
MISSIONS IN THE NEXT DECADE TO

02:50:15.305 --> 02:50:16.439
KEEP THEM WARMING BELOW TWO

02:50:16.506 --> 02:50:18.508
DEGREES CELSIUS AND WHO BELIEVE

02:50:18.575 --> 02:50:20.510

TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS.

02:50:23.112 --> 02:50:24.213
AN INTERSECTIONAL WAY.

02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:26.449
THAT CREATES EQUITABLE OUTCOMES

02:50:26.516 --> 02:50:28.418
FOR ALL IN CHANGES WHAT IS

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:30.486
POSSIBLE FOR OUR STATE.

02:50:30.553 --> 02:50:31.354
WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT HOW THEY

02:50:31.421 --> 02:50:33.022
RELEASED AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS

02:50:33.089 --> 02:50:34.557
THIS AT THE POLICY WITH THE

02:50:34.624 --> 02:50:36.259
COMPROMISE IT'S ONE THAT I DON'T

02:50:36.326 --> 02:50:38.361
BELIEVE WILL MAKE A REAL OR

02:50:38.428 --> 02:50:39.495
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR

AND I'LL GET MORE INTO WHITE

02:50:47.470 --> 02:50:48.104
SHORTLY.

02:50:48.171 --> 02:50:50.073
I DO THINK HOWEVER YOU AT THE

02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:52.008
BODY.

02:50:52.075 --> 02:50:53.876
HAVE THE ABILITY TO CORRECT THAT

02:50:53.943 --> 02:50:56.079
[inaudible] FOR ONE BEAR THAT

02:50:56.145 --> 02:50:57.947
NO LONGER IS IN PLACE.

02:50:58.014 --> 02:50:59.716
GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN.

02:50:59.782 --> 02:51:01.317

02:51:14.731 --> 02:51:16.399
BECOME A PRIORITY --

02:51:16.466 --> 02:51:18.568
I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT MAYBE

02:51:18.635 --> 02:51:20.803
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE

02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:22.138
BEST DECISION AT THE TIME.

BY ALL MEANS IT WAS IMPAIRED

02:51:31.614 --> 02:51:34.217
IT'S IMPERATIVE WE DIRECT EIGHTY

ENORMOUS KHïI. TO TELL YOU A

02:51:47.964 --> 02:51:48.498
LITTLE BIT ABOUT FAMILY DRAMA

02:51:48.564 --> 02:51:49.932
SCHOOL WAY.

02:51:49.999 --> 02:51:51.300
IT'S ONE TOP BY CENSUS TRACT

02:51:51.367 --> 02:51:53.002
COMMUNITIES FROM CALAVERAS

02:51:53.069 --> 02:51:53.369
SCREEN.

02:51:53.436 --> 02:51:56.606
IT'S LOW INCOME.

02:51:56.673 --> 02:51:58.441
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

02:51:58.508 --> 02:52:00.009
WE HAVE KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL

02:52:00.076 --> 02:52:02.311
BETWEEN THE B. NSL FELL YARDS

02:52:02.378 --> 02:52:04.681
HIGH TRAFFIC TRUCK ROUTES GOING

02:52:04.747 --> 02:52:06.416
TO AND FROM WHERE HOUSING.

02:52:06.482 --> 02:52:07.984
AND NATURAL GAS PIPES AND TANKS

02:52:08.051 --> 02:52:09.218
THAT HAVE LEAKED.

02:52:09.285 --> 02:52:10.586
AND LIKE WHAT JUST HAPPENED OVER

02:52:10.653 --> 02:52:15.224
THE WEEKEND WICKS BUT 40% OF ALL

02:52:15.291 --> 02:52:16.626
GETS THE REST OF THE UNITED

02:52:16.693 --> 02:52:19.128
STATES COMES TO OUR BACKYARDS.

02:52:19.195 --> 02:52:20.730
IMAGINE ALL THAT TRUCK TRAFFIC

02:52:20.797 --> 02:52:23.166
JUST TAKE A SECOND TO IMAGINE

02:52:23.232 --> 02:52:25.034
ONE HUNDRED DIESEL TRUCKS PER

02:52:25.101 --> 02:52:26.302
HOUR COMING DOWN YOUR STREET.

02:52:26.369 --> 02:52:28.471
HOW THAT BILL?

02:52:28.538 --> 02:52:30.640
UNDOUBTEDLY THE NEED TO ADDRESS

02:52:30.707 --> 02:52:31.708
GREAT HERE POLLUTANTS IN

02:52:31.774 --> 02:52:33.142
EMISSIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY IS SO --

02:52:33.209 --> 02:52:35.745
DE OVER THE YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN

02:52:35.812 --> 02:52:38.014
SO MANY PLANS BUT VERY LITTLE

02:52:38.081 --> 02:52:39.048
CHANGE.

02:52:39.115 --> 02:52:40.283
SOME OF THE MOST COMMON

02:52:40.349 --> 02:52:41.918
CHALLENGES THESE PLANS HAVE FACE

02:52:41.984 --> 02:52:44.854
ARE ALSO TRIP AB.

02:52:44.921 --> 02:52:45.755
SEVEN SIX SEVENTEEN FIRST WE

02:52:45.822 --> 02:52:47.356
MUST DISCUSS ENFORCEMENT.

02:52:47.423 --> 02:52:48.424
MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY

02:52:48.491 --> 02:52:49.826
HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT WE

02:52:49.892 --> 02:52:51.594
ARE ASKING FOR COMMUNITIES TO

02:52:51.661 --> 02:52:53.663
GET THEIR HOPES UP FOR ANOTHER

02:52:53.730 --> 02:52:55.398
PROGRAM PROMISING IMPROVEMENT.

02:52:55.465 --> 02:52:56.399
ONE OF THE REASONS OUR COMMUNITY

02:52:56.466 --> 02:52:57.700
REMAINS IN NON ATTAINMENT

02:52:57.767 --> 02:52:59.135
COMMUNITY FOR CRITERIA

02:52:59.202 --> 02:53:00.570
POLLUTANTS IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

02:53:00.636 --> 02:53:01.671
ENFORCING WHAT'S ALREADY IN

02:53:01.738 --> 02:53:02.805
PLACE.

02:53:02.872 --> 02:53:04.607
ALSO THERE'S NO LANGUAGE IN THE

02:53:04.674 --> 02:53:06.109
BILL THAT I COULD IDENTIFY THAT

02:53:06.175 --> 02:53:08.144
DISCUSSES REPERCUSSIONS TO CARP

02:53:08.211 --> 02:53:09.979
HM DE FOR NOT REACHING THE GOALS

02:53:10.046 --> 02:53:11.280
OF THE PROGRAM.

02:53:11.347 --> 02:53:13.049
SHARE AN ORGANIZATION CAN GO

02:53:13.116 --> 02:53:14.751
THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS TO

02:53:14.817 --> 02:53:16.052
ENFORCE THE PLAN BUT NOT PUTS

02:53:16.119 --> 02:53:17.353
ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON OUR

02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:19.255
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE

02:53:19.322 --> 02:53:20.990
ALREADY PUTTING OUT FIRES IN OUR

02:53:21.057 --> 02:53:22.725
COMMUNITIES.

02:53:22.792 --> 02:53:24.193
LITERALLY TO APPARENTLY.

02:53:24.260 --> 02:53:25.528
THE STATE NEEDS TO FIND BETTER

02:53:25.595 --> 02:53:29.465
MEANS TO ENFORCE IMPLEMENTATION

02:53:29.532 --> 02:53:30.666
OF THE REDUCTION PLANS.

02:53:30.733 --> 02:53:31.534
WHERE FREIGHT WILL COME UP WITH

02:53:31.601 --> 02:53:32.635
THE PLAN BUT THERE WILL BE A

02:53:32.702 --> 02:53:33.970
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO

02:53:34.036 --> 02:53:36.172
ENFORCE THE PLAN AND ENFORCE

02:53:36.239 --> 02:53:38.074
COMPLIANCE FROM THE SOURCES? ONE

02:53:38.141 --> 02:53:39.509
WAY THE SENTIMENT HAVE ALREADY

02:53:39.575 --> 02:53:40.743
ARISEN HAS BEEN FROM THE TYPE OF

02:53:40.810 --> 02:53:42.478
MONITORING THE DISTRICT IS

02:53:42.545 --> 02:53:43.513
LOOKING TO USE.

02:53:43.579 --> 02:53:44.480
AIR MONITORS THAT ARE PLANNED TO

02:53:44.547 --> 02:53:47.517
BE YOU IT ENOUGH TO DETERMINE

02:53:47.583 --> 02:53:50.052
COMPLIANCE SO THEREFORE SOURCES

02:53:50.119 --> 02:53:51.587
OF POLLUTANTS CAN'T BE SUBJECTED

02:53:51.654 --> 02:53:53.289
TO ENFORCEMENT BASED ON MOST OF

02:53:53.356 --> 02:53:54.190
THE MONITORING BEING FUNDED IN

02:53:54.257 --> 02:53:55.825
THE PROGRAM.

02:53:55.892 --> 02:53:57.293
THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME.

02:53:57.360 --> 02:53:58.327
BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO SPEND

02:53:58.394 --> 02:53:59.862
MONEY ON THE PROGRAM THAT WE

02:53:59.929 --> 02:54:00.963
SHOULD DO IT RIGHT AND MAKE SURE

02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:02.231
WE HAVE THE BEST AVAILABLE

02:54:02.298 --> 02:54:03.666
MONITORING.

02:54:03.733 --> 02:54:05.301
THAT WILL ALSO ALLOW ENFORCEMENT

02:54:05.368 --> 02:54:07.003
OF SOURCES.

02:54:07.069 --> 02:54:08.471
OF FORT UNFORTUNATELY THAT LEADS

02:54:08.538 --> 02:54:09.872
TO THE SECOND CHALLENGE.

02:54:09.939 --> 02:54:11.073
THE FUNDING COMMITTED IS NOT

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:12.408
SUFFICIENT TO IMPLEMENT THE

02:54:12.475 --> 02:54:14.143
PROGRAM AS BEST AS POSSIBLE.

02:54:14.210 --> 02:54:16.779
I DO WISH TO RECOMMEND EIGHTY

02:54:16.846 --> 02:54:17.747
SIX SEVENTEEN FOR INCREASED

02:54:17.814 --> 02:54:19.682
FUNDING IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET --

02:54:19.749 --> 02:54:21.150
I THINK THE STATE HAS MADE MANY

02:54:21.217 --> 02:54:22.518
COMMITMENTS TO DISADVANTAGED

02:54:22.585 --> 02:54:24.854
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON TO FILL

02:54:24.921 --> 02:54:25.888
PROMISES.

02:54:25.955 --> 02:54:28.057
DON'T MAKE THIS ANOTHER.

02:54:28.124 --> 02:54:29.458
ONE BEFORE WE CAN EVEN BEGIN TO

02:54:29.525 --> 02:54:30.960
THINK ABOUT YOUR TO COMMUNITIES

02:54:31.027 --> 02:54:32.228
WE NEED A PROGRAM THAT'S PROVEN

02:54:32.295 --> 02:54:33.329
EFFECTIVE I THINK THE

02:54:33.396 --> 02:54:35.097
LEGISLATURE TO THE BUDGET NEEDS

02:54:35.164 --> 02:54:36.165
TO MAINTAIN COMMITMENT TO YOUR

02:54:36.232 --> 02:54:37.366
ONE COMMUNITIES.

02:54:37.433 --> 02:54:38.701
ALSO THE NEED FOR DRESSING

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:39.869
POLLUTANTS IN EMISSIONS IS SO

02:54:39.936 --> 02:54:41.971
VAST WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO

02:54:42.038 --> 02:54:43.206
EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO MORE

02:54:43.272 --> 02:54:44.473
COMMUNITIES.

02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:45.608
BUT WHAT WE DON'T NEED IS THE

02:54:45.675 --> 02:54:47.543
STATE TO THROW MONEY AND FINDING

02:54:47.610 --> 02:54:49.212
A WAY TO A PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T

02:54:49.278 --> 02:54:50.413
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE ENFORCEABLE

02:54:50.479 --> 02:54:51.647
REDUCTIONS.

02:54:51.714 --> 02:54:53.683
WE NEED TO GET SET COMPLIANCE

02:54:53.749 --> 02:54:55.451
WE'VE BEEN OUT OF A COMPLAINT

02:54:55.518 --> 02:54:56.986
SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THROWING

02:54:57.053 --> 02:54:58.321
MORE MONEY AND SUBSIDIZING

02:54:58.387 --> 02:55:00.223
BRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN

02:55:00.289 --> 02:55:02.124
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND WE

02:55:02.191 --> 02:55:04.493
HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE.

02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:06.262
WE NEED TO KIND OF GET OUT OKAY

02:55:06.329 --> 02:55:08.197
BECAUSE I GOT LIKE A LOT GO

02:55:08.264 --> 02:55:10.132
AHEAD GO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT --

02:55:10.199 --> 02:55:11.067
YOU CAN THE NUMBER I SAID

02:55:11.133 --> 02:55:14.637
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE EVERYONE

02:55:14.704 --> 02:55:15.271
IS SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT MINUTES

02:55:15.338 --> 02:55:18.641
IN YOUR LIFE MYSELF IS ALSO MADE

02:55:18.708 --> 02:55:19.175
IN WRITING.

02:55:19.242 --> 02:55:20.042
THERE WE GO --

02:55:20.109 --> 02:55:21.244
BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT I THINK THE

02:55:21.310 --> 02:55:23.112
BIGGEST CáC OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN

02:55:23.179 --> 02:55:24.413
IS IS IF YOU WANT TO DELIVER

02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:25.681
CRITERIA POLLUTANT.

02:55:25.748 --> 02:55:27.116
DELIVER --

02:55:27.183 --> 02:55:28.651
CURTIRPOLLUTANTS IN AT AN AIR

02:55:28.718 --> 02:55:30.486
TOXIC REDUCTIONS WE NEED TO TAKE

02:55:30.553 --> 02:55:32.355
ACTION ON DIESEL TRUCKS --

02:55:32.421 --> 02:55:33.422
WE DON'T MEAN ON ENFORCEABLE

02:55:33.489 --> 02:55:35.391
STATES AND PLANS ON A WE DON'T

02:55:35.458 --> 02:55:37.360
NEED THE NEXT AVAILABLE

02:55:37.426 --> 02:55:38.160
TECHNOLOGY THAT LEASES

02:55:38.227 --> 02:55:39.962
SUSCEPTIBLE TO EXPLOSIONS NEXT

02:55:40.029 --> 02:55:41.631
TARGET SCHOOLS AND WE DON'T NEED

02:55:41.697 --> 02:55:43.065
PUBLIC DOLLARS SUBSIDIZING

02:55:43.132 --> 02:55:45.034
BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT INDUSTRIES

02:55:45.101 --> 02:55:46.669
BECAUSE THEY TEND TO TAKE JOBS

02:55:46.736 --> 02:55:46.869
AWAY.

02:55:46.936 --> 02:55:51.908
ON I KNOW IT'S A IN THIS KIND OF

02:55:51.974 --> 02:55:53.142
CLIMB IT SOMETIMES IT'S SEEN AS

02:55:53.209 --> 02:55:53.776
WE NEED COURAGE SHOULD REALLY

02:55:53.843 --> 02:55:55.478
TAKE ACTION ON TRUCKING --

02:55:55.544 --> 02:55:56.846
AND I KNOW THE SENSITIVITY TO

02:55:56.913 --> 02:55:58.281
WORKERS AND ALSO FEDERAL

02:55:58.347 --> 02:56:00.249
CHALLENGES.

02:56:00.316 --> 02:56:00.917
A FEDERAL CHALLENGES GETTING US

02:56:00.983 --> 02:56:02.151
THE SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

02:56:02.218 --> 02:56:03.519
ZERO MISSION TECH --

02:56:03.586 --> 02:56:05.221
TRUCKING --

02:56:05.288 --> 02:56:06.155
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH

02:56:06.222 --> 02:56:08.858
SAYS AND SENSITIVITY FOUR SEVEN

02:56:08.925 --> 02:56:09.458
EIGHT YOU KNOW MY SCHOOL I AND

02:56:09.525 --> 02:56:10.860
OTHER COMMUNITIES BURDEN CANCER

02:56:10.927 --> 02:56:13.529
RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND DEATH --

02:56:13.596 --> 02:56:14.931
BUT I'M SENSITIVE TO THOSE

02:56:14.997 --> 02:56:16.799
WORKERS I HAVE FEELS WHO ARE

02:56:16.866 --> 02:56:18.601
FORMER TRUCK WORKERS --

02:56:18.668 --> 02:56:19.535
AND I UNDERSTAND HOW IT HELPS

02:56:19.602 --> 02:56:24.440
pA HUNDRED BUT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S

02:56:24.507 --> 02:56:26.475
RECENTLY STATED STAT.

02:56:26.542 --> 02:56:31.781
LIKE WORKING IN A RESPONSE IT

02:56:31.847 --> 02:56:34.550
BEGIN ABOUT AUTOMATION HOW THIS.

02:56:34.617 --> 02:56:36.218
AND THE REASON WE'RE NOT EXCITED

02:56:36.285 --> 02:56:37.720
IS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY

02:56:37.787 --> 02:56:39.221
WHERE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB

02:56:39.288 --> 02:56:40.923
YOUR LEFT TO DIE AND THAT IS AT

02:56:40.990 --> 02:56:42.391
ITS CORE OUR PROBLEM.

02:56:42.458 --> 02:56:44.727
AND IT'S SOMETHING OUR CLINIC

02:56:44.794 --> 02:56:49.365

02:57:25.735 --> 02:57:27.837
PROCESS IS IN PROGRESS WHEN IT'S

02:57:27.903 --> 02:57:30.039
A DISTRACTION TO POLICY THAT

A RESPONSE TO OUR CRITIQUES WAS

02:57:42.084 --> 02:57:44.253
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT MONITORING

02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:44.754
THIS IS ABOUT EMISSIONS

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:45.688
REDUCTIONS.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.268
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T MAKE IT WORK

02:57:59.335 --> 02:57:59.835
THEM WHAT ARE WHAT ARE OUR

02:57:59.902 --> 02:58:01.170
OPTIONS.

02:58:01.237 --> 02:58:02.471
AND SO --

02:58:02.538 --> 02:58:04.273
WE'VE BEEN HERE TO MAKE IT WORK

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:06.642
WE'VE BEEN AT A Q. M. D. TO MAKE

02:58:06.709 --> 02:58:07.843
IT WORK.

02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:09.145
I CAN POINT TO TOO MANY THINGS

02:58:09.211 --> 02:58:11.013
BUT I'LL POINT TO THE PORT

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:12.548
BACKSTOP RULE IN PARTICULAR.

02:58:12.615 --> 02:58:14.183
WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO ENSURE

02:58:14.250 --> 02:58:16.318
THAT -- THE

02:58:16.385 --> 02:58:17.953
PORTS.

02:58:18.020 --> 02:58:19.121
OF ALLEY IN LONG BEACH REACHED

02:58:19.188 --> 02:58:21.323
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TARGETS.

02:58:21.390 --> 02:58:22.758
AND THAT.

02:58:22.825 --> 02:58:25.494
IT WOULD BE ENFORCEABLE.

02:58:25.561 --> 02:58:26.929
UNFORTUNATELY THERE WERE SOME

02:58:26.996 --> 02:58:28.964
CHANGES IN IN THE BOARD MAKE UP

02:58:29.031 --> 02:58:31.867
AND STAFF DIDN'T BRING IT TO THE

02:58:31.934 --> 02:58:33.736
BOARD.

02:58:33.803 --> 02:58:35.237
AND SO WHEN QUESTIONED.

02:58:35.304 --> 02:58:36.939
PUBLICLY WHAT WAS STATED --

02:58:37.006 --> 02:58:39.642
OR YOU KNOW LEGALLY IS KNOWLEDGE

02:58:39.708 --> 02:58:42.111
HE SAYS IS NOT AVAILABLE YET.

02:58:42.178 --> 02:58:43.846
BUT WHAT STAFF TOLD US DIRECTLY

02:58:43.913 --> 02:58:45.214
WAS IT WASN'T POLITICALLY

02:58:45.281 --> 02:58:47.249
FEASIBLE ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE

02:58:47.316 --> 02:58:48.417
NEW PORT MAKE [inaudible]

02:58:48.484 --> 02:58:51.787
WHICH IS THE WORST POSSIBLE

02:58:51.854 --> 02:58:52.988
REASON TO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING

02:58:53.055 --> 02:58:54.323
RIGHT.

02:58:54.390 --> 02:58:55.491
AND SO --

02:58:55.558 --> 02:58:57.126
ALSO POINT TO INDIRECT SOURCE

02:58:57.193 --> 02:58:58.394
RULES WHICH WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

02:58:58.461 --> 02:58:59.395
WORK -- WORK

02:58:59.462 --> 02:59:00.996
AT WITH.

02:59:01.063 --> 02:59:02.765
WITH THE DISTRICT AND

02:59:02.832 --> 02:59:05.201
UNFORTUNATELY --

02:59:05.267 --> 02:59:07.570
PORTS ARE NOT NOT REALLY PART OF

02:59:07.636 --> 02:59:09.438
THE CONVERSATION --

02:59:09.505 --> 02:59:11.907
RAIL IS IS REALLY ABSENT IN AND

02:59:11.974 --> 02:59:13.509
WHEN IT COMES TO WAREHOUSES --

02:59:13.576 --> 02:59:15.411
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMHO USE AND

02:59:15.478 --> 02:59:16.479
THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING

02:59:16.545 --> 02:59:18.814
THAT THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN WE

02:59:18.881 --> 02:59:19.281
WANT SOMETHING THAT'S

02:59:19.348 --> 02:59:20.449
ENFORCEABLE.

02:59:20.516 --> 02:59:23.586
AND SO PRIOR TO A. B. SIX ONE

02:59:23.652 --> 02:59:24.653
SEVEN WE REALLY GOT A POINT BACK

02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:26.388
TO SB ONE RIGHT IF WE'RE GONNA

02:59:26.455 --> 02:59:28.991
GET THE THE THE LARGER CONTEXT.

02:59:29.058 --> 02:59:30.726
AND SO --

02:59:30.793 --> 02:59:32.261
OUR OUR ASSEMBLY WOMAN WAS ABLE

02:59:32.328 --> 02:59:33.395
TO GET THE GOVERNOR TO COME DOWN

02:59:33.462 --> 02:59:34.897
AND VISIT WITH US AND AND THAT

02:59:34.964 --> 02:59:36.532
WAS A GREAT SESSION AND TING HE

02:59:36.599 --> 02:59:37.133
HEARD FROM FROM MANY

02:59:37.199 --> 02:59:38.267
STAKEHOLDERS.

02:59:38.334 --> 02:59:41.871
AND EXPRESSED INTEREST IN IN --

02:59:41.937 --> 02:59:44.640
INDIRECT SOURCE WAS HE ACTUALLY --

02:59:44.707 --> 02:59:45.875
EXPRESS A LITTLE BIT ARE SHOCKED

02:59:45.941 --> 02:59:46.976
THAT WE DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE THAT

02:59:47.042 --> 02:59:49.178
IN HOW ARE WE CALIFORNIA WE

02:59:49.245 --> 02:59:51.514
DON'T HAVE INTERREX SOURCE RULES --

02:59:51.580 --> 02:59:53.983
UNFORTUNATELY.

02:59:54.049 --> 02:59:59.555
WHAT WE GOT BACK WAS WAS A BE --

02:59:59.622 --> 03:00:00.689
SIX ONE SEVEN AND AGAIN WE'RE

03:00:00.756 --> 03:00:03.225
WE'RE HERE TO MAKE IT WORK RIGHT.

03:00:03.292 --> 03:00:04.827
SO WHEN WE ATTEND.

03:00:04.894 --> 03:00:06.462
THE A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN MEETINGS

03:00:06.529 --> 03:00:08.631
IN OUR COMMUNITIES UNFORTUNATELY

03:00:08.697 --> 03:00:10.299
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS IS KIND OF A

03:00:10.366 --> 03:00:12.134
COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH FROM THE

03:00:12.201 --> 03:00:15.371
DISTRICT --

03:00:15.437 --> 03:00:17.139
AND I THINK WHAT WHAT.

03:00:17.206 --> 03:00:18.374
WHAT I'VE NOTICED FROM

03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:19.241
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS OF

03:00:19.308 --> 03:00:21.143
HEARING EVERYONE BUT ALSO FROM

03:00:21.210 --> 03:00:21.677
FOLKS THAT WE WORK WITH

03:00:21.744 --> 03:00:23.312
CONSISTENTLY AS ALL OF OUR

03:00:23.379 --> 03:00:24.647
COMMUNITIES ARE DIFFERENT RIGHT?

03:00:24.713 --> 03:00:25.848
EVEN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

03:00:25.915 --> 03:00:26.715
ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING US

03:00:26.782 --> 03:00:28.551
IT'S LITERALLY THE SAME GOODS

03:00:28.617 --> 03:00:30.553
MOVEMENT FOR STRUCTURE --

03:00:30.619 --> 03:00:32.154
BUT YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE

03:00:32.221 --> 03:00:33.055
COMMUNITIES THAT THAT ARE IN

03:00:33.122 --> 03:00:34.690
FRONT OF YOU YOU HAVE TO CENTER

03:00:34.757 --> 03:00:36.358
THE THE THE COMMUNITIES AND

03:00:36.425 --> 03:00:37.626
NEEDS TO BE COMMUNITY LEAD AND

03:00:37.693 --> 03:00:38.561
THEY THINK.

03:00:38.627 --> 03:00:40.162
I DESCRIBED EARLIER TODAY IS

03:00:40.229 --> 03:00:41.063
THIS PROCESS FEELS LIKE IT'S

03:00:41.130 --> 03:00:42.865
BEEN POSTED LEAD.

03:00:42.932 --> 03:00:44.333
RIGHT VERY VERY SURFACE

03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:45.768
ENGAGEMENT --

03:00:45.834 --> 03:00:47.069
FEELING KIND OF LIKE CHECKING A

03:00:47.136 --> 03:00:49.104
BOX LIKE THEY'VE ALREADY SET UP

03:00:49.171 --> 03:00:51.173
A PLAN FOR HOW THIS PROCESS IS

03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:52.408
GOING TO ROLL OUT.

03:00:52.474 --> 03:00:53.842
AND AND THE REALITY IS WE'RE

03:00:53.909 --> 03:00:55.844
READY TO GO WE WERE READY TO GO

03:00:55.911 --> 03:00:57.379
MONTHS AGO WE ARE READY TO GO

03:00:57.446 --> 03:00:58.647
YEARS AGO RIGHT.

03:00:58.714 --> 03:00:59.815
AND SO I THINK --

03:00:59.882 --> 03:01:02.051
THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THOSE OF US

03:01:02.117 --> 03:01:02.651
WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS

03:01:02.718 --> 03:01:04.920
PROCESS NEEDS TO BE A REFLECTIVE

03:01:04.987 --> 03:01:07.156
OF WHERE WE'RE AT WE NEED TO BE

03:01:07.223 --> 03:01:07.323
MET.

03:01:07.389 --> 03:01:10.893
WHERE WHERE --

03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:12.228
WE DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH

03:01:12.294 --> 03:01:15.564
MONTHS OF A PROCESS --

03:01:15.631 --> 03:01:16.899
TO TO TRY --

03:01:16.966 --> 03:01:18.467
TO ESSENTIALLY GET TO A PLACE

03:01:18.534 --> 03:01:20.236
WHERE WE'VE BEEN AT RIGHT THAT

03:01:20.302 --> 03:01:22.004
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT --

03:01:22.071 --> 03:01:23.105
BECAUSE AT LEAST FROM MY

03:01:23.172 --> 03:01:25.741
EXPERIENCE IT THEY REALLY FELT

03:01:25.808 --> 03:01:27.543
LIKE AN EIGHT Q. M. D. --

03:01:27.610 --> 03:01:29.044
PUBLIC RELATIONS ROLL OUT.

03:01:29.111 --> 03:01:30.613
THOUGH THE WAY THE SOME OF THE

03:01:30.679 --> 03:01:33.816
MEETINGS WERE WERE HANDLING --

03:01:33.882 --> 03:01:36.151
AND AND I UNDERSTAND FOR FOR FOR

03:01:36.218 --> 03:01:37.386
FOLKS WHO MAY BE ARE FAMILIAR

03:01:37.453 --> 03:01:38.821
WITH THE DISTRICT MAYBE IT'S

03:01:38.887 --> 03:01:40.256
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT

03:01:40.322 --> 03:01:41.957
MAY BE NEEDED BUT FOR THOSE OF

03:01:42.024 --> 03:01:42.858
US WHO ARE ENGAGING IN THIS

03:01:42.925 --> 03:01:44.560
PROCESS --

03:01:44.627 --> 03:01:46.562
WE KNOW WHAT A KIM DE IS WE'VE

03:01:46.629 --> 03:01:48.797
WE'VE KNOWN WHAT THEY'VE DONE --

03:01:48.864 --> 03:01:50.366
AND WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE INTO.

03:01:50.432 --> 03:01:52.268
RIGHT.

03:01:52.334 --> 03:01:53.802
AND SO --

03:01:53.869 --> 03:01:55.571
YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE BIG

03:01:55.638 --> 03:01:56.705
ISSUES AGAIN TWENTY BACK TO

03:01:56.772 --> 03:01:57.506
MONITORING [inaudible]

03:01:57.573 --> 03:02:00.309
AND AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE

03:02:00.376 --> 03:02:01.977
CALLED OUT CONSISTENTLY IS

03:02:02.044 --> 03:02:03.879
ESPECIALLY IF IF FUNDS ARE BEING

03:02:03.946 --> 03:02:05.314
INVESTED IN MONITORS THAT ARE

03:02:05.381 --> 03:02:06.315
NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE

03:02:06.382 --> 03:02:07.650
INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDING

03:02:07.716 --> 03:02:08.984
INFORMATION THAT.

03:02:09.051 --> 03:02:10.552
THAT CAN BE IN.

03:02:10.619 --> 03:02:12.521
IN FLEET TO ENFORCEMENT --

03:02:12.588 --> 03:02:15.791
IT'S REALLY NEEDING TO NOTHING --

03:02:15.858 --> 03:02:16.792
WE'VE WE'VE DONE LOW COST

03:02:16.859 --> 03:02:18.294
MONITORING.

03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:19.161
WE'VE DONE THAT IN OUR

03:02:19.228 --> 03:02:20.863
COMMUNITIES FOR FOR TWO DECADES

03:02:20.929 --> 03:02:22.331
RIGHT TO THINK WE'VE BEEN DOING

03:02:22.398 --> 03:02:26.201
THIS RIGHT --

03:02:26.268 --> 03:02:27.303
AND WE'VE DONE IT BECAUSE THE

03:02:27.369 --> 03:02:28.637
BOARDS THE AIRPORTS HAVE BEEN

03:02:28.704 --> 03:02:29.738
DONE THEIR JOBS.

03:02:29.805 --> 03:02:32.241
THAT'S WHY WE'VE DONE IT.

03:02:32.308 --> 03:02:33.642
WE DID LOW COST MONITORING

03:02:33.709 --> 03:02:36.545
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE RESOURCES.

03:02:36.612 --> 03:02:37.880
SO WHEN THE DISTRICT COMES BACK

03:02:37.946 --> 03:02:39.948
IN AND IS TALKING ABOUT THIS

03:02:40.015 --> 03:02:42.384
BEING ONE OF THEIR STRATEGIES --

03:02:42.451 --> 03:02:44.153
IT'S SHOCKING THAT THEY'RE

03:02:44.219 --> 03:02:44.787
TRYING TO REPLICATE WHAT WE'VE

03:02:44.853 --> 03:02:47.423
DONE. FOR US THE RESPONSES ACT

03:02:47.489 --> 03:02:49.558
LIKE AN INSTITUTION YOU ARE AN

03:02:49.625 --> 03:02:52.328
INSTITUTION YOU ARE AN AUTHORITY

03:02:52.394 --> 03:02:56.932
YOUR GRANTED CERTAIN POWERS.

03:02:56.999 --> 03:02:59.868
ACT WITH THAT RIGHT --

03:02:59.935 --> 03:03:01.770
SHOWS YOU CAN TAKE ACTION SHOWS

03:03:01.837 --> 03:03:03.972
YOU CAN IN FORCES --

03:03:04.039 --> 03:03:05.708
AND SO WE'RE HERE WE'RE READY TO

03:03:05.774 --> 03:03:07.876
GO AND AND A LOT OF CASES WE ACT

03:03:07.943 --> 03:03:09.144
AS A BRIDGE.

03:03:09.211 --> 03:03:10.446
RIGHT YOU HEARD FROM FOLKS

03:03:10.512 --> 03:03:11.847
EARLIER TODAY THAT WERE PUT INTO

03:03:11.914 --> 03:03:13.349
OTHER AGENCIES AND YOU TO ENGAGE

03:03:13.415 --> 03:03:15.150
IN THE PROCESS WE NEED TO ENGAGE

03:03:15.217 --> 03:03:17.419
WITH THOSE AS WELL --

03:03:17.486 --> 03:03:18.954
NOW I'LL I'LL CALL BACK TO ONE

03:03:19.021 --> 03:03:20.856
OF OUR OUR OUR MEMBERS IN THE

03:03:20.923 --> 03:03:21.957
COMMITTEE --

03:03:22.024 --> 03:03:24.727
RAFA WHO WAS ON THE VERGE OF

03:03:24.793 --> 03:03:25.761
DISRUPTING THE MEAL KEPT COMING

03:03:25.828 --> 03:03:26.695
OUT WHY ARE WE GOING THROUGH

03:03:26.762 --> 03:03:28.864
THROUGH THIS DE CHARETTE RIDER

03:03:28.931 --> 03:03:32.201
OR CHARADES WHEN WE KNOW WHAT

03:03:32.267 --> 03:03:32.868
THE ISSUES ARE.

03:03:32.935 --> 03:03:33.802
RIGHT AND SO WE TOOK A FORTY

03:03:33.869 --> 03:03:35.337
FIVE MINUTE PROCESS TO GET TO

03:03:35.404 --> 03:03:35.938
THE POINT THAT HE WAS MAKING

03:03:36.004 --> 03:03:36.905
THAT.

03:03:36.972 --> 03:03:38.440
ARE THOSE PRIORITIES THERE AND

03:03:38.507 --> 03:03:39.475
YOU SAID WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST

03:03:39.541 --> 03:03:40.642
MANY WE TALK ABOUT IN THE LAST

03:03:40.709 --> 03:03:41.577
MINUTE EVERY MEETING WE KEEP

03:03:41.643 --> 03:03:43.011
BRINGING UP THE SAME ISSUES.

03:03:43.078 --> 03:03:43.946
WE DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH

03:03:44.012 --> 03:03:45.280
THESE PROCESSES BECAUSE WE KNOW

03:03:45.347 --> 03:03:47.015
WHAT THE ISSUES ARE LET'S TALK

03:03:47.082 --> 03:03:48.183
ABOUT SOLUTIONS I GUESS THAT'S

03:03:48.250 --> 03:03:49.952
NOT ON THE VERGE OF WHERE WE'RE

03:03:50.018 --> 03:03:51.453
AT RIGHT NOW.

03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:53.288
AND SO AGAIN WE'RE HERE TO MAKE

03:03:53.355 --> 03:03:56.558
TO MAKE IT WORK --

03:03:56.625 --> 03:03:58.861
AND AND THE REALITY IS WE WE

03:03:58.927 --> 03:04:00.329
LIVE IN A IN A POLITICAL ECOLOGY.

03:04:00.396 --> 03:04:02.698
RIGHT AND SO MY FEAR IS THAT

03:04:02.765 --> 03:04:04.400
WHERE WE'RE HEADED IN THIS

03:04:04.466 --> 03:04:05.834
PROCESS AND I KIND OF THOUGHT IN

03:04:05.901 --> 03:04:06.935
THE POWER POINT A LITTLE BIT

03:04:07.002 --> 03:04:08.270
PRESENTED EARLIER.

03:04:08.337 --> 03:04:10.372
IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE.

03:04:10.439 --> 03:04:12.908
GUIDED UP TO TO PUT IT NICELY

03:04:12.975 --> 03:04:14.443
WE'RE GONNA BE GUIDED --

03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:16.145
TO SUPPORT A BALLOT MEASURE TO

03:04:16.211 --> 03:04:17.713
CREATE A FUNDING STREAM --

03:04:17.780 --> 03:04:19.648
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO OUR

03:04:19.715 --> 03:04:23.419
TOWARDS FALL SOLUTIONS IT'S A

03:04:23.485 --> 03:04:24.653
THAT THE DISTRICT IS IS

03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:26.021
INTERESTED IN.

03:04:26.088 --> 03:04:27.289
AND AND REALLY IS HEADING

03:04:27.356 --> 03:04:30.125
TOWARDS YES --

03:04:30.192 --> 03:04:31.293
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN --

03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:33.662
CONSULTANTS AND AND NONPROFIT

03:04:33.729 --> 03:04:34.763
ORGANIZATIONS IN LOS ANGELES

03:04:34.830 --> 03:04:36.498
PUMPING UP THE THE FUTURE OF

03:04:36.565 --> 03:04:38.801
THIS THIS MEASURE --

03:04:38.867 --> 03:04:40.469
AND TALKING ABOUT FUNDING WHAT

03:04:40.536 --> 03:04:41.870
WHAT'S AVAILABLE NOW WHICH IS

03:04:41.937 --> 03:04:43.705
NATURAL GAS AND THEN IN TEN

03:04:43.772 --> 03:04:45.808
YEARS WE CAN CONSIDER --

03:04:45.874 --> 03:04:47.309
ZERO EMISSIONS --

03:04:47.376 --> 03:04:48.844
WHICH OF COURSE IS IS NOT AT ALL

03:04:48.911 --> 03:04:49.978
WHAT WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN

03:04:50.045 --> 03:04:51.180
WHERE WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN

03:04:51.246 --> 03:04:53.015
ANY PUBLIC FUNDS GOING. TO A

03:04:53.081 --> 03:04:54.316
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN AROUND

03:04:54.383 --> 03:04:55.517
FOR A LONG TIME --

03:04:55.584 --> 03:04:56.718
WE'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

03:04:56.785 --> 03:05:00.456
OF THAT BREACH AND SO --

03:05:00.522 --> 03:05:01.824
WE KNOW THAT THAT THESE

03:05:01.890 --> 03:05:02.891
CONVERSATIONS ARE ALL TIED

03:05:02.958 --> 03:05:05.561
TOGETHER AND SO --

03:05:05.627 --> 03:05:06.929
THIS ISN'T TO SAY FREE POLLUTION

03:05:06.995 --> 03:05:08.964
IS IS OUR ONLY ISSUE AN INDIRECT

03:05:09.031 --> 03:05:10.699
SOURCE RULES --

03:05:10.766 --> 03:05:11.266
ARE DEFINITELY NOT OUR ONLY

03:05:11.333 --> 03:05:12.734
SOLUTION --

03:05:12.801 --> 03:05:14.470
BUT IF IF WE CAN'T MOVE TOWARDS

03:05:14.536 --> 03:05:16.538
THESE REGULATORY SOLUTIONS WITH

03:05:16.605 --> 03:05:18.740
ALL THE DATA ALL THE FUN DEAN

03:05:18.807 --> 03:05:20.876
AND ALL THE COMMUNITY DIRECTION

03:05:20.943 --> 03:05:22.311
THAT HAS ALREADY EXISTED.

03:05:22.377 --> 03:05:24.046
THEN WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM

03:05:24.112 --> 03:05:25.581
THESE AGENCIES MOVING FORWARD

03:05:25.647 --> 03:05:26.915
RIGHT -- WE

03:05:26.982 --> 03:05:28.884
NEED ACTION FROM THE LOCAL.

03:05:28.951 --> 03:05:30.319
AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND WE

03:05:30.385 --> 03:05:32.154

OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS --

03:05:36.024 --> 03:05:36.558
AND IT NEEDS TO BE COMMUNITY

03:05:36.625 --> 03:05:39.561
CENTER BECAUSE RIGHT --

03:05:39.628 --> 03:05:41.697
SO.

03:05:41.763 --> 03:05:42.764
I THINK AT THE HEART OF THIS IS

03:05:42.831 --> 03:05:44.233

SUPERSEDE US YET GOVERNMENT

03:08:02.738 --> 03:08:04.806
AGENCIES HAVE DELEGATED

03:08:04.873 --> 03:08:06.808
AUTHORITY TO THEMSELVES. TO MAKE

03:08:06.875 --> 03:08:08.410
DECISIONS THAT THEY HAVE NO

03:08:08.477 --> 03:08:09.911
RIGHT TO DO AND WE WANT THAT

03:08:09.978 --> 03:08:12.881
STOPPED WE WANT LEGISLATURE TO

03:08:12.948 --> 03:08:15.550
MAKE SURE THAT STOPS.

03:08:15.617 --> 03:08:16.685
OTHER QUESTIONS THAT'LL COME OUT

03:08:16.752 --> 03:08:19.087
ABOUT EIGHTY SIX SEVEN SIX ONE

SEVEN FROM INDUSTRY --

03:08:19.955 --> 03:08:21.657
IT'S ONLY STATIONARY.

03:08:21.723 --> 03:08:23.892
SO IN ONE OF THE PAGES I QUOTE

03:08:23.959 --> 03:08:25.961
TO SECTION OF AB SIX ONE SEVEN

03:08:26.028 --> 03:08:27.295
THAT STATE MOLD FORCES ARE

03:08:27.362 --> 03:08:29.531
INCLUDED.

03:08:29.598 --> 03:08:30.932
I ALSO INCLUDE SOME PAGES WHAT

03:08:30.999 --> 03:08:32.868
TOOK ONE EXAMPLE OF CONICAL

03:08:32.934 --> 03:08:34.703
PHILLIPS OR REFINERY SO ONE PAGE

03:08:34.770 --> 03:08:35.871
SHOWS YOU.

AND GUESS WHAT YOU DISCOVER.

03:08:46.915 --> 03:08:48.817
THERE'S BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT

03:08:48.884 --> 03:08:51.386
REDUCTION WHAT SO EVER.

03:08:51.453 --> 03:08:53.989
AND I CAN TELL YOU WHY.

03:08:54.056 --> 03:08:55.290
THE GUYS SO BECAUSE THEY CAN BE

CREDITS.

03:09:01.930 --> 03:09:04.666
EVERYWHERE ELSE AND NEVER REDUCE

03:09:04.733 --> 03:09:05.934
POLLUTION.

03:09:06.001 --> 03:09:07.402
SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE DATA I'VE

03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:09.271

SO NOW I HAVE MORE ACCESS TO

03:09:15.210 --> 03:09:16.945
MORE INFORMATION.

03:09:17.012 --> 03:09:18.346
BUT THE DATA SHOWS.

03:09:18.413 --> 03:09:20.115
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SEVENTEEN

03:09:20.182 --> 03:09:23.185
YEARS WORTH OF DATA.

03:09:23.251 --> 03:09:24.319
SEVERAL CATEGORIES A TRACTOR

03:09:24.386 --> 03:09:26.822
PULLS HAVE GONE UP IN MANY

03:09:26.888 --> 03:09:29.157
CATEGORIES OF TOXIC POLLUTANTS

HAVE GONE UP.

03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:33.762
WE NEED TO STOP THAT SO WE'RE

03:09:33.829 --> 03:09:35.397
TALKING ABOUT REDUCING THE

03:09:35.464 --> 03:09:37.332
FORTUNATELY.

03:09:37.399 --> 03:09:38.967

AND WHAT I LEARNED.

03:09:51.046 --> 03:09:52.547
REFINERY TECHNOLOGIES COULD BE

03:09:52.614 --> 03:09:55.517
REDUCED AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT.

03:09:55.584 --> 03:09:56.785
WE CAME UP WITH OUR OWN LITTLE

03:09:56.852 --> 03:09:58.086
GOALS.

03:09:58.153 --> 03:09:59.321
IF YOU LOOK AT A CANDY GOALS

03:10:58.246 --> 03:11:00.081
ON PLANET EARTH WE ARE PROVIDING

03:11:00.148 --> 03:11:01.483
A MONTHLY SURVEY.

03:11:01.550 --> 03:11:05.053
OF ALL ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES

03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:06.488
AND ZERO EMISSIONS EQUIPMENT.

03:11:06.555 --> 03:11:10.659
BY MANUFACTURER AND MODEL NUMBER.

03:11:10.725 --> 03:11:11.760
NOW THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE OTHER

03:11:11.827 --> 03:11:14.863
EQUIPMENT LIKE FOR REFINERIES.

03:11:14.930 --> 03:11:16.464
VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEMS HAVE

03:11:16.531 --> 03:11:19.801
EXISTED AND APPROVED BY EPA FOR

03:11:19.868 --> 03:11:20.402
TWENTY FIVE YEARS ARE OFF THE

03:11:20.468 --> 03:11:22.103
SHELF.

03:11:22.170 --> 03:11:24.339
BUT NOT ONE TITLE FIGHT PERMIT

03:11:24.406 --> 03:11:25.340
FROM ANY COMMITTEE MAKES IT

03:11:25.407 --> 03:11:29.110
MANDATORY FOR EVERY STORAGE TANK

03:11:29.177 --> 03:11:30.912
SAYS RESULT WE HAVE.

03:11:30.979 --> 03:11:32.113
HUNDREDS OF TONS OF VOCS COMING

03:11:32.180 --> 03:11:34.683
OUT.

03:11:34.749 --> 03:11:36.985
FLARING OUR MAJOR EVENTS.

03:11:37.052 --> 03:11:38.653
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT.

03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:40.388
WE HAVE ALL THESE FIVE SIX POWER

03:11:40.455 --> 03:11:41.489
OUTAGES.

03:11:41.556 --> 03:11:44.526
AND THE WORST DAYS ARE THE

03:11:44.593 --> 03:11:46.428
FLARING DAYS WHEN THE POWER GOES

03:11:46.494 --> 03:11:49.297
OUT FOR ONE TO ONE AND HALF DAYS.

03:11:49.364 --> 03:11:51.399
WHAT'S THE SOLUTION.

03:11:51.466 --> 03:11:52.601
WELL WE KNOW THEY HAD A LIQUID

03:11:52.667 --> 03:11:53.802
MET BREAK DOWN.

03:11:53.869 --> 03:11:55.604
BUT IF THEY HAD A BACKUP POWER

03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:57.639
SYSTEM THERE WE WANT TO HAVE

03:11:57.706 --> 03:11:58.440
THAT.

03:11:58.506 --> 03:12:00.775
DO YOU HAVE A GOOD EXAMPLE YES

03:12:00.842 --> 03:12:02.878
B. B. R. GOING CARSON HAS TO

03:12:02.944 --> 03:12:04.980
COACH AND PLANTS THAT THEY NEVER

03:12:05.046 --> 03:12:06.514
GO OUT [inaudible]

03:12:06.581 --> 03:12:10.285
BUT WHERE IS REQUIREMENTS FOR

03:12:10.352 --> 03:12:11.286
EVERYBODY ELSE TO HAVE A BACKUP

03:12:11.353 --> 03:12:14.055
POWER IT'S NOT THERE.

03:12:14.122 --> 03:12:15.790
AND THEY SAY OH FLARING IT'S A

03:12:15.857 --> 03:12:18.226
FOR SAFETY YOUR WANTED EXPLODING

03:12:18.293 --> 03:12:19.561
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO HURT

03:12:19.628 --> 03:12:20.228
ANYBODY.

03:12:20.295 --> 03:12:22.197
YOU KNOW WE'RE LOSING PROFITS

03:12:22.264 --> 03:12:24.966
BURNING OUR FUEL [inaudible]

03:12:25.033 --> 03:12:27.002
WELL SIMPLE.

03:12:27.068 --> 03:12:28.436
YOU HAVE THE VAPOR RECOVERY

03:12:28.503 --> 03:12:29.070
SYSTEM WHICH IS A PIPE SO IN

03:12:29.137 --> 03:12:31.506
YOUR GAS IS GO UP THEY GO DIVERT

03:12:31.573 --> 03:12:33.008
TO PIPE TO AN EMPTY TANK.

03:12:33.074 --> 03:12:35.777
AND YOU'RE ABLE TO USE IT AGAIN

03:12:35.844 --> 03:12:37.379
AND YOU DON'T LOSE PROFITS.

03:12:37.445 --> 03:12:39.414
SO WE KNOW TECHNOLOGIES.

03:12:39.481 --> 03:12:40.749
AND WE ARE AT THAT LEVEL NOW

03:12:40.815 --> 03:12:42.717
WHAT WE COULD CONTRIBUTE. TO THE

03:12:42.784 --> 03:12:44.352
AWARENESS OF WHAT TECHNOLOGIES

03:12:44.419 --> 03:12:45.954
ARE APPLICABLE WHEN WE TALK

03:12:46.021 --> 03:12:47.622
ABOUT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS I CAN

03:12:47.689 --> 03:12:49.024
TELL YOU ONE THING IN OUR PLAN

03:12:49.090 --> 03:12:50.692
WE'RE GONNA DATA FIVE SPECIFIC

03:12:50.759 --> 03:12:52.127
EQUIPMENT.

03:12:52.193 --> 03:12:53.561
LAST MONTH I SUBMIT A PUBLIC

03:12:53.628 --> 03:12:56.164
COMMENTS ON SIX OR REFINERIES IN

03:12:56.231 --> 03:12:57.866
LA THEIR DRAFT FENCE LINE

03:12:57.933 --> 03:12:59.534
MONITORING PLAN.

03:12:59.601 --> 03:13:01.202
AND I REJECTED ALL SIX OF THEM.

03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:04.773
NONE OF THEM WERE A 100% 90% 80%

03:13:04.839 --> 03:13:08.977
THEY'RE ABOUT 6270% OKAY.

03:13:09.044 --> 03:13:10.278
WHERE THEY FAILED THE MOST WAS

03:13:10.345 --> 03:13:12.514
AN PUBLIC NOTIFICATION TO ANYONE

03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:15.083
PUT IN ANYTHING IN THAT CATEGORY

03:13:15.150 --> 03:13:16.651
FOR PUBLIC NOTIFICATION?

03:13:16.718 --> 03:13:17.819
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE THE

03:13:17.886 --> 03:13:19.287
GUIDANCE THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

03:13:19.354 --> 03:13:21.556
THEY DIDN'T AND THEN WERE USING

03:13:21.623 --> 03:13:23.425
TECHNOLOGY YES I'M BECOMING VERY

03:13:23.491 --> 03:13:24.426
AWARE.

03:13:24.492 --> 03:13:25.927
OF AIR MONITORING EQUIPMENT AND

03:13:25.994 --> 03:13:27.729
TECHNOLOGIES ONE COMPANY

03:13:27.796 --> 03:13:28.997
CONTACTED ME AND I CONTACTED

03:13:29.064 --> 03:13:30.265
THEM.

03:13:30.332 --> 03:13:31.599
THEY HAVE AN FTIR.

03:13:31.666 --> 03:13:33.401
THE BEST ONE I CAN READ RIGHT

03:13:33.468 --> 03:13:35.870
NOW ON PLANET EARTH NOW WHY IS

03:13:35.937 --> 03:13:37.539
THAT IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY CAN

03:13:37.605 --> 03:13:39.040
DETECT THE CHEMICAL AND LESS

03:13:39.107 --> 03:13:40.408
THAN A MINUTE.

03:13:40.475 --> 03:13:42.777
THEY CAN QUEUE A VALIDATE THAT

03:13:42.844 --> 03:13:44.746
DATA IN LESS THAN A MINUTE AND

03:13:44.813 --> 03:13:46.581
THEY CAN REPORT IT IN LESS THAN

03:13:46.648 --> 03:13:48.249
ONE MINUTE.

03:13:48.316 --> 03:13:50.685
THEY STAND FIVE TIMES VERSUS

03:13:50.752 --> 03:13:52.821
FOUR TIMES.

03:13:52.887 --> 03:13:53.955
BUT WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT

03:13:54.022 --> 03:13:55.423
BECAUSE SEE [inaudible]

03:13:55.490 --> 03:13:57.625
IN TORRANCE.

03:13:57.692 --> 03:13:59.327
AT THE TORRANCE REFINERY THEY

03:13:59.394 --> 03:14:01.196
HAVE A CHEMICAL CALLED HYDROGEN

03:14:01.262 --> 03:14:03.064
FLUORIDE IN WILMINGTON AT THE

03:14:03.131 --> 03:14:04.632
ALTAR MARVOLO WE HAVE A CHEMICAL

03:14:04.699 --> 03:14:05.300
CALLED.

03:14:05.367 --> 03:14:08.470
HYDROGEN FLUORIDE AND IF THAT

03:14:08.536 --> 03:14:09.838
TANK BREAKS LOOSE.

03:14:09.904 --> 03:14:11.006
IT KILLS EVERYBODY WITHIN

03:14:11.072 --> 03:14:12.574
MINUTES.

03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:14.843
WITHIN TWO MILES.

03:14:14.909 --> 03:14:17.245
SO HAVING A FIVE TEN MINUTE OR

NOTIFICATION AS TO WHAT HAPPENED

03:14:20.115 --> 03:14:22.317
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

03:14:22.384 --> 03:14:24.452
IF THAT BREAKS LOOSE EVERYONE

03:14:24.519 --> 03:14:25.286
DIES.

03:14:25.353 --> 03:14:26.855

03:17:48.656 --> 03:17:50.825
PROBABLY MOST CLEAR WITH REGARDS

03:17:50.892 --> 03:17:51.926

03:17:53.895 --> 03:17:57.065
SOME OF THE OTHER BUT SOUTH

03:17:57.131 --> 03:17:58.366
COAST DOES HAVE --

03:17:58.433 --> 03:17:59.867
I WOULD SAY LIMITED AUTHORITY

OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS DID

03:21:06.721 --> 03:21:08.456
PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK ALTHOUGH I

03:21:08.523 --> 03:21:10.758
THINK IT JUST SPEAKS TO A HIGHER

03:21:10.825 --> 03:21:11.359
ISSUE.

03:21:11.426 --> 03:21:13.828
IN THAT A LOT OF THIS IS BEING

03:21:13.895 --> 03:21:16.264
DISTRICT DRIVEN AND NOT

03:21:16.330 --> 03:21:17.365
COMMUNITY DRIVEN.

03:21:17.432 --> 03:21:18.499
ON THE AND THANK YOU FOR THAT

03:21:18.566 --> 03:21:19.300
MATTER I MEAN I'M TRYING TO GET

03:21:19.367 --> 03:21:20.902
AT THAT POINT I I HAVE TO I

03:21:20.968 --> 03:21:22.069
APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T GET TO HEAR

03:21:22.136 --> 03:21:23.471
THE PRESENTATIONS EARLIER

03:21:23.538 --> 03:21:26.073
BECAUSE MY OTHER PASSION --

03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:29.544
TALKING ABOUT MY PRE TO THE

03:21:29.610 --> 03:21:31.012
SOUTH UP IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE.

03:21:31.078 --> 03:21:31.779
THANK YOU --

03:21:31.846 --> 03:21:32.780
BUT I I I I APPRECIATE SOME OF

03:21:32.847 --> 03:21:33.981
YOU WERE ABLE TO COME TALK TO ME

03:21:34.048 --> 03:21:35.349
A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF TIME.

03:21:35.416 --> 03:21:37.318
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND I I

03:21:37.385 --> 03:21:38.553
DON'T EXPECT EVERY DISTRICT TO

03:21:38.619 --> 03:21:40.087
BE THE SAME AND AND I EXPECTED

03:21:40.154 --> 03:21:41.589
TO BE GROWING PAINS ACROSS THE

03:21:41.656 --> 03:21:42.490
BOARD.

03:21:42.557 --> 03:21:44.125
BUT IN SOME DISTRICTS THAT THERE

03:21:44.192 --> 03:21:45.159
SEEMS TO BE A MUCH MORE

03:21:45.226 --> 03:21:47.428
COLLABORATIVE --

03:21:47.495 --> 03:21:49.730
TEAM EFFORT AND FROM THE THIRTY

03:21:49.797 --> 03:21:50.965
COMMUNITY GROUPS HERE THAT THERE

03:21:51.032 --> 03:21:53.434
SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT AND SO

03:21:53.501 --> 03:21:56.571
I I PICKED ON THE CHARTER

03:21:56.637 --> 03:21:57.138
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS

03:21:57.205 --> 03:21:59.440
MEANT.

03:21:59.507 --> 03:22:00.875
TWO OF OF THE LIST EVEN THAT A

03:22:00.942 --> 03:22:02.410
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS OF HOW WE

03:22:02.477 --> 03:22:04.111
WORK TOWARDS BUILDING THAT TRUST

03:22:04.178 --> 03:22:05.613
I THINK AND MY COMMUNITY I'VE

03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:07.281
SEEN OTHER LACK OF TRUST.

03:22:07.348 --> 03:22:09.016
AND SO EVERY STEP IS GOING TO BE

03:22:09.083 --> 03:22:10.184
PAINFUL AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA

03:22:10.251 --> 03:22:12.153
REQUIRED A LOT OF EXTRA WORK BUT

03:22:12.220 --> 03:22:12.653
I THINK EVERY STEP THIS

03:22:12.720 --> 03:22:14.922
OPPORTUNITY. TO BUILD THAT TRUST

03:22:14.989 --> 03:22:16.557
AND GETTING THE CHARTER GOING

03:22:16.624 --> 03:22:18.159
MIGHT BE PART OF AND I THINK I

03:22:18.226 --> 03:22:19.026
SENATE-DISTRICT YOU HAVE A

03:22:19.093 --> 03:22:19.861
DEADLINE THEY HAVE TO MEETING

03:22:19.927 --> 03:22:20.995
YOUR SEEN THAT SO YOU'RE TRYING

03:22:21.062 --> 03:22:22.129
TO BE LIKE LET ME MAKE SURE I DO

03:22:22.196 --> 03:22:23.364
WHAT I CAN NOW TO HELP.

03:22:23.431 --> 03:22:24.932
MEET THAT DEADLINE AND MAYBE

03:22:24.999 --> 03:22:25.566
THERE'S WERE GREAT COULD DO AT A

03:22:25.633 --> 03:22:26.868
TIME.

03:22:26.934 --> 03:22:28.135
BUT SOMETIMES THAT BEEN WORKS

03:22:28.202 --> 03:22:30.605
AGAINST US IN IN THE LONG HAUL

03:22:30.671 --> 03:22:32.340
AND IN THE COMMITMENT FROM THE

03:22:32.406 --> 03:22:34.342
COMMUNITY MEMBERS I DISAGREE A

03:22:34.408 --> 03:22:35.710
LITTLE BIT WITH MATT --

03:22:35.776 --> 03:22:38.045
ABOUT THE POWER OF AB SIX

03:22:38.112 --> 03:22:39.080
SEVENTEEN YEAR READ OF HOW IT

03:22:39.146 --> 03:22:40.047
WAS IT WAS --

03:22:40.114 --> 03:22:41.549
VOTED ON AND WHAT I HAD TO

03:22:41.616 --> 03:22:42.817
LEVERAGE --

03:22:42.884 --> 03:22:44.952
BUT BUT IT'S IT'S ONLY GOING TO

03:22:45.019 --> 03:22:46.721
BE SUCCESSFUL IF I HAVE BY IN

03:22:46.787 --> 03:22:48.389
FROM MY COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

03:22:48.456 --> 03:22:50.691
AND IT WORRIES ME THAT ARE HAVE

03:22:50.758 --> 03:22:52.293
BY IN IN IN ULTIMATELY IS LIKE

03:22:52.360 --> 03:22:53.561
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO WHAT WE

03:22:53.628 --> 03:22:55.229
NEED TO REFINE THIS PROCESS. TO

03:22:55.296 --> 03:22:56.898
GET THAT BY IN AND HOW DO WE

03:22:56.964 --> 03:22:58.966
MAKE SURE THAT THAT MORE OF WHAT

03:22:59.033 --> 03:23:00.568
THEY WANT IS IS BEING INCLUDED

03:23:00.635 --> 03:23:02.203
IN I TELL MY COMMUNITY MEMBERS

03:23:02.270 --> 03:23:03.638
ARE NOT GOING TO GET IT ALL.

03:23:03.704 --> 03:23:05.006
RIGHT AND IT'S A DOWN PAYMENT IT

03:23:05.072 --> 03:23:05.973
WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR FOR A

03:23:06.040 --> 03:23:10.845
BETTER BUT IT DOES WORRY ME THAT

03:23:10.912 --> 03:23:12.146
IN SOME [inaudible]

03:23:12.213 --> 03:23:16.050
AND I I HAVE HOPE IT'S NOT

03:23:16.117 --> 03:23:17.218
PERFECT IN THIS IS WHAT I WANT

03:23:17.285 --> 03:23:18.419
TO SEE AND THEN I'M HEARING HERE

03:23:18.486 --> 03:23:20.354
IN THE SOUTH COAST REGION.

03:23:20.421 --> 03:23:21.389
I WOULD ENACTED THIS IS ALL

03:23:21.455 --> 03:23:22.023
SIXTEEN AND I DON'T HEAR A LOT

03:23:22.089 --> 03:23:23.491
OF HOPE HERE ABOUT WHERE WE'RE

03:23:23.558 --> 03:23:25.660
GOING TO HAVE --

03:23:25.726 --> 03:23:27.161
AND SO THAT'S WHY I PICKED ON

03:23:27.228 --> 03:23:27.995
THE CHARTER I DON'T KNOW THERE'S

03:23:28.062 --> 03:23:29.730
MORE PIECES OUT THERE BUT I

03:23:29.797 --> 03:23:31.232
THINK EVERY STEP IS A STEP. TO

03:23:31.299 --> 03:23:34.468
BEST BUILD THAT TRUST AND WHILE

03:23:34.535 --> 03:23:36.203
WE HAVE A REAL DEADLINE.

03:23:36.270 --> 03:23:37.271
SOMETIMES WE CAN'T WE SHOULD BE

03:23:37.338 --> 03:23:38.673
GETTING AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

03:23:38.739 --> 03:23:41.409
AND IN THAT PROCESS --

03:23:41.475 --> 03:23:43.711
AND ARE WORTH MATTER AND SO I

03:23:43.778 --> 03:23:44.812
THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL I

03:23:44.879 --> 03:23:45.846
ALSO WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE

03:23:45.913 --> 03:23:47.481
MONETARY --

03:23:47.548 --> 03:23:48.549
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE

03:23:48.616 --> 03:23:49.951
THAT'S BEEN EQUITY FOR QUITE

03:23:50.017 --> 03:23:51.185
AWHILE FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

03:23:51.252 --> 03:23:52.286
ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST IN

03:23:52.353 --> 03:23:54.422
THIS REGION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

PROBLEM MONITORS AND IT'S NOT

03:24:13.808 --> 03:24:14.675
THE END OF THAT IS GOING TO MEAN

03:24:14.742 --> 03:24:16.344
ANYTHING FOR ENFORCEMENT.

03:24:16.410 --> 03:24:17.311
WHY AREN'T WE DOING A LITTLE BIT

03:24:17.378 --> 03:24:20.881
MORE OF THE DATA THAT THAT WILL

03:24:20.948 --> 03:24:26.120
MEAN SOMETHING FOR ENFORCEMENT?

03:24:26.187 --> 03:24:27.622

WE WE DO THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

03:24:42.269 --> 03:24:44.639
USEFUL.

03:24:44.705 --> 03:24:46.107
LOW COST MONITORING VERSES

03:24:46.173 --> 03:24:47.608
REGULATORY MONITORING IT IS BOTH

03:24:47.675 --> 03:24:48.676
THEY BOTH SERVE DIFFERENT

03:24:48.743 --> 03:24:50.745
PURPOSES IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO

03:24:50.811 --> 03:24:52.213
PUT A THOUSAND REGULATORY

03:24:52.279 --> 03:24:53.781

THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE THAT'S

03:26:00.214 --> 03:26:01.949
WITHIN THE STATUTE AND AGAIN

03:26:02.016 --> 03:26:04.652
IT'S A SURE THE FRUSTRATION WITH --

03:26:04.719 --> 03:26:05.920
ALL THE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE

03:26:05.986 --> 03:26:06.620

03:26:11.926 --> 03:26:12.660
TOO IT IS WE HAVE A LOT OF NEW

03:26:12.727 --> 03:26:14.628
PEOPLE IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO

03:26:14.695 --> 03:26:15.896
BRING EVERYONE UP --

03:26:15.963 --> 03:26:17.231
TO THAT CONSENSUS.

03:26:17.298 --> 03:26:18.532
CONSENSUS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING

03:26:18.599 --> 03:26:19.967
TO MOVE FORWARD --

03:26:20.034 --> 03:26:21.268

03:26:23.337 --> 03:26:24.572
LINES EVEN TIGHTER.

03:26:24.638 --> 03:26:25.673
SO -- IT IS

03:26:25.740 --> 03:26:26.907
A CHALLENGE BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY

03:26:26.974 --> 03:26:28.008
TO GET A BASIC LEVEL OF

03:26:28.075 --> 03:26:29.376
MONITORING OUT THERE.

03:26:29.443 --> 03:26:30.211
AND WAS WORKING WITH THE

03:26:30.277 --> 03:26:31.512
COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP THOSE

03:26:31.579 --> 03:26:33.147
MONITORING PLANS.

FOR EXAMPLE.

03:26:38.719 --> 03:26:39.653
MAYBE THERE WAS WORK THAT COULD

03:26:39.720 --> 03:26:40.821
HAVE BEEN DONE EARLIER ON THE

03:26:40.888 --> 03:26:42.556
MONITORING SITE THAT WAS YOU

03:26:42.623 --> 03:26:44.024

03:26:44.091 --> 03:26:45.292
HAS BEEN SAYING. FOR TOO MANY

03:26:45.359 --> 03:26:46.494
YEARS I'VE BEEN AROUND AND

03:26:46.560 --> 03:26:47.161
THEY'VE BEEN AROUND LONGER THAN

I HAVE ISSUING DISCUSSING THIS

03:26:48.929 --> 03:26:51.098
ISSUE BUT I WILL SAY THAT THESE

03:26:51.165 --> 03:26:52.366
MONITORS IN THE TYPE OF MINERS

03:26:52.433 --> 03:26:54.001
THAT WERE YOU SEEN EVEN BEFORE

03:26:54.068 --> 03:26:55.336
AB.

03:26:55.402 --> 03:26:56.604
SIX SEVENTEEN WAS TALKED ABOUT

03:26:56.670 --> 03:26:57.671
WITH AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN OUT

03:26:57.738 --> 03:26:58.906
THERE AND A FRUSTRATION AMONG

03:26:58.973 --> 03:27:00.174
THE COMMUNITY AND IT COULD HAVE

03:27:00.241 --> 03:27:00.808
BEEN A PLACE WHERE MAYBE WE CAN

03:27:00.875 --> 03:27:01.742
ABOUT AND I HAD.

03:27:01.809 --> 03:27:04.044

AND SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO GET

03:27:10.417 --> 03:27:10.985
AHEAD AND SOMETHING'S BUT THAT

03:27:11.051 --> 03:27:11.986
MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

03:27:12.052 --> 03:27:15.189
A BETTER PLACE TO TO GET AHEAD.

03:27:15.256 --> 03:27:17.024
ON A SOME OF THE MONETARY IN OUT

03:27:17.091 --> 03:27:18.025

WHEN COULD SPEAK TO THAT BUT IT

03:31:17.531 --> 03:31:18.699

EVERYTHING WE NEED THAT LEVEL OF

03:31:20.434 --> 03:31:21.535
FUNDING GOING FORWARD WE THINK

FOCUSING ON THE TORCH REFINERY

03:31:51.565 --> 03:31:53.400
MY DISTRICT I MEAN WHAT WHEN CAN

03:31:53.467 --> 03:31:54.735
WE EXPECT TO SEE.

03:31:54.802 --> 03:31:56.537
THE THIS AIR POLLUTION REDUCING

03:31:56.603 --> 03:32:00.074
TECHNOLOGY BEING --

03:32:00.140 --> 03:32:04.044
INSTALLED AND AND PUT TO USE --

03:32:04.111 --> 03:32:05.746
IT SO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IS

03:32:05.813 --> 03:32:07.548
ALWAYS THE ANSWER BUT REFINERIES

03:32:07.614 --> 03:32:09.483
ARE COMPLEX --

03:32:09.550 --> 03:32:12.219
ORGANISMS AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY

03:32:12.286 --> 03:32:13.454
HAVE TURN AROUND SCHEDULES HAVE

03:32:13.520 --> 03:32:15.055
DIFFERENT SCHEDULES SO THE

03:32:15.122 --> 03:32:16.090
THINGS THEY CAN DO FOR IT

03:32:16.156 --> 03:32:17.758
QUICKLY WE WON'T REQUIRE THEM TO

03:32:17.825 --> 03:32:18.792
DO QUICKLY AND THE THINGS THAT

03:32:18.859 --> 03:32:20.861
NEED MORE TIME WILL TAKE MORE

03:32:20.928 --> 03:32:21.228
TIME.

03:32:21.295 --> 03:32:22.796
OUR GOALS AND MAXIMIZING THE

03:32:22.863 --> 03:32:25.265
EARLY REDUCTIONS SO WHATEVER WE

03:32:25.332 --> 03:32:26.300
CAN.

03:32:26.366 --> 03:32:27.901
REQUIRE THEM TO DO EARLY WE WANT

03:32:27.968 --> 03:32:29.470
TO FOCUS ON THE LARGEST EMITTING

03:32:29.536 --> 03:32:30.904
EQUIPMENT --

03:32:30.971 --> 03:32:34.608
AND MAKE SURE WE GET THOSE

03:32:34.675 --> 03:32:37.177
BENEFITS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE --

03:32:37.244 --> 03:32:38.979
TO BE TO BE MONITORED YEAH A OR

03:32:39.046 --> 03:32:41.081
D. FOOT FOR THE CONTROLS TO GO

03:32:41.148 --> 03:32:42.549
ON SURE OKAY --

03:32:42.616 --> 03:32:44.017
IT.

03:32:44.084 --> 03:32:45.552
AM I CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING

03:32:45.619 --> 03:32:46.587
THAT.

03:32:46.653 --> 03:32:48.522
THAT THE FLARING --

03:32:48.589 --> 03:32:49.356
INCIDENTS --

03:32:49.423 --> 03:32:50.157
GO.

03:32:50.224 --> 03:32:55.028
BECAUSE THE SPIKES IN IN IN THE

03:32:55.095 --> 03:32:58.599
THE THE THE AIR POLLUTION --

03:32:58.665 --> 03:32:59.733
THAT -- THAT

03:32:59.800 --> 03:33:02.169
AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS IS TRYING TO

03:33:02.236 --> 03:33:03.137
TARGET.

03:33:03.203 --> 03:33:04.638
THEY CAN --

03:33:04.705 --> 03:33:06.106
SO AGAIN ROUTINE FLARING IS NOT

03:33:06.173 --> 03:33:08.809
ALLOWED IT ONLY HAPPENS EITHER.

03:33:08.876 --> 03:33:10.244
FOR EMERGENCY REASONS WHICH ARE

03:33:10.310 --> 03:33:11.912
USUALLY THOSE BIG FLARES THAT

03:33:11.979 --> 03:33:13.280
EVERYONE SEES ON THE NEWS AND

03:33:13.347 --> 03:33:15.382
AND AND JESSE IS TALKING ABOUT --

03:33:15.449 --> 03:33:17.451
ALSO THERE IS SOME WHAT'S KNOWN

03:33:17.518 --> 03:33:18.719
AS NANA.

03:33:18.785 --> 03:33:20.287
NANA TEEN FLARING WHEN THEY WERE

03:33:20.354 --> 03:33:22.055
DOING CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND

03:33:22.122 --> 03:33:24.091
DOING TURNAROUNDS IN MAINTAINING

03:33:24.158 --> 03:33:25.626
EQUIPMENT --

03:33:25.692 --> 03:33:27.694
IT IT'S FOR THE NON ROUTINE

03:33:27.761 --> 03:33:29.363
FLARING I THINK THERE'S SOME

03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:30.631
THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE AND

03:33:30.697 --> 03:33:31.732
JESSE MENTIONED SOME OF THEM

03:33:31.798 --> 03:33:32.866
ENHANCING THE VAPOR RECOVERY

03:33:32.933 --> 03:33:36.570
SYSTEMS TO HAVE MORE CAPACITY --

03:33:36.637 --> 03:33:37.571
FOR THE EMERGENCY FLARING

03:33:37.638 --> 03:33:39.139
SOMETIMES THAT'S TOUGH BUT I

03:33:39.206 --> 03:33:40.641
THINK WE CAN WE CAN DO A LOT OF

03:33:40.707 --> 03:33:41.375
WORK ABOUT.

03:33:41.441 --> 03:33:46.213
A PUBLIC NOTIFICATION AND VAPOR

03:33:46.280 --> 03:33:47.748
RECOVERY IS ONE THING BUT AT

03:33:47.814 --> 03:33:49.049
SOME POINT THAT MAY RUN OUT SO

03:33:49.116 --> 03:33:50.217
THEY MIGHT HAVE TO BE A FLARE

03:33:50.284 --> 03:33:51.585
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO WITH

03:33:51.652 --> 03:33:53.086
MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT AND

03:33:53.153 --> 03:33:55.622
AND MAKING SURE THE PUBLIC KNOWS.

03:33:55.689 --> 03:33:58.358
WITH WHAT WITH YOU BEING EXPOSED --

03:33:58.425 --> 03:34:00.727
TO SO IN SOME CASES YES THAT WE

03:34:00.794 --> 03:34:01.628
HAVE SEEN --

03:34:01.695 --> 03:34:03.130
SHORT TERM INCREASES WITH

03:34:03.197 --> 03:34:06.967
ESPECIALLY DURING THOSE LARGER

03:34:07.034 --> 03:34:09.536
FLYING OF AND THINGS BUT IT.

03:34:09.603 --> 03:34:10.971
YEAH ON THAT AND THEN AGAIN.

03:34:11.038 --> 03:34:11.572
DUE.

03:34:11.638 --> 03:34:12.472
TO YOUR BILL ASSEMBLY MAN --

03:34:12.539 --> 03:34:13.373
AB --

03:34:13.440 --> 03:34:13.941
SIXTEEN FORTY SEVEN THERE'S

03:34:14.007 --> 03:34:14.942

AT ALL OUR REFINERIES --

03:34:17.177 --> 03:34:19.446
WE WE PASSED INTO OUR WILL

03:34:19.513 --> 03:34:20.080
ELEVEN EIGHTY BY THE ENDOF THIS

03:34:20.147 --> 03:34:21.548
YEAR AS WELL AS COMMUNITY

03:34:21.615 --> 03:34:23.317
MONITORING --

03:34:23.383 --> 03:34:24.651
IN THE COMMUNITIES AROUND

03:34:24.718 --> 03:34:26.353
REFINERIES WHICH OVERLAPS.

03:34:26.420 --> 03:34:28.088
WITH THE A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN

03:34:28.155 --> 03:34:30.457
COMMUNITIES IN MANY PLACES --

03:34:30.524 --> 03:34:31.024
SO THAT IS ALL HAPPENING IN

03:34:31.091 --> 03:34:34.561
PARALLEL EMPLOYMENT AB SIX

03:34:34.628 --> 03:34:35.696
SEVENTEEN OR SO WHEN TO EXPECT

03:34:35.762 --> 03:34:36.496
THOSE MONITORS TO BE UP AND

RUNNING.

03:34:37.431 --> 03:34:40.100
THE DEADLINE IN THE BILL WHICH

I I I GUESS I I I I SHARE MY THE

03:34:46.273 --> 03:34:47.708
THE THE FRUSTRATION THAT WAS EXT

03:34:47.774 --> 03:34:49.009
EXPRESSED EARLIER IN THIS

03:34:49.076 --> 03:34:50.010
HEARING BY.

GOING TO HAPPEN AND AND AND WE

03:35:00.687 --> 03:35:02.422
GET THESE REPORTS ON HOW MUCH

03:35:02.489 --> 03:35:04.491
KNOCKS AND AND AND AND AND ALL

03:35:04.558 --> 03:35:06.093
THIS OTHER NASTY STUFF IS IS

03:35:06.159 --> 03:35:10.063
GOING TO BE MADE IN OUR

03:35:10.130 --> 03:35:13.500
COMMUNITIES BUT YOU KNOW.

03:35:13.567 --> 03:35:14.601
WELL I I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE

03:35:14.668 --> 03:35:15.602
THAT -- THAT

03:35:15.669 --> 03:35:17.170
THEY DID THAT THE COMMUNITY IS

03:35:17.237 --> 03:35:18.805
IS IT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN

03:35:18.872 --> 03:35:21.241
WE SEE THESE DRAMATIC FLARES --

03:35:21.308 --> 03:35:22.843
IT -- IT

03:35:22.909 --> 03:35:25.312
JUST HEIGHTENS THE THE THE THE

03:35:25.379 --> 03:35:28.515
THE CONCERN --

03:35:28.582 --> 03:35:30.050
IS SO WHAT WITH THIS VAPOR

03:35:30.117 --> 03:35:31.518
REDUCTION IS THAT PART OF THE

03:35:31.585 --> 03:35:33.186
BARK TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEING.

03:35:33.253 --> 03:35:35.122
CONSIDERED [inaudible]

03:35:35.188 --> 03:35:37.991
IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE PARK IT IS

03:35:38.058 --> 03:35:38.759
NOT NECESSARILY CONTROL

03:35:38.825 --> 03:35:41.428
TECHNOLOGY IN THAT SENSE BUT WE

03:35:41.495 --> 03:35:42.863
DO WANT TO COME BACK WITH OUR

03:35:42.929 --> 03:35:44.731
FLARE REDUCTION RULE.

03:35:44.798 --> 03:35:45.966
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO AND ONE

03:35:46.033 --> 03:35:47.968
OF THE POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGIES

03:35:48.035 --> 03:35:49.603
THAT CAN DO THAT IS.

03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:50.704
THEY DO HAVE PAPER RECOVERY

03:35:50.771 --> 03:35:52.005
SYSTEMS --

03:35:52.072 --> 03:35:54.174
BUT THE MAYBE THEY CAN BE

03:35:54.241 --> 03:35:55.175
ENHANCED IT'LL --

03:35:55.242 --> 03:35:57.477
LARGER CAN HANDLE MORE VOLUME SO

03:35:57.544 --> 03:35:58.445
THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE'RE

03:35:58.512 --> 03:35:59.913
LOOKING AT WE WANT TO WORK WITH

03:35:59.980 --> 03:36:00.981
THE WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE

03:36:01.048 --> 03:36:03.083
IN A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN CONTEXT

03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:04.551
TO HELP DEVELOP THAT --

03:36:04.618 --> 03:36:06.153
IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL REFINERIES

03:36:06.219 --> 03:36:08.088
BUT YOU KNOW OUR MAJOR

03:36:08.155 --> 03:36:10.791
REFINERIES ARE MOSTLY IN THAT --

03:36:10.857 --> 03:36:11.425
ONE COMMUNITY.

03:36:11.491 --> 03:36:12.392
AM I CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING

03:36:12.459 --> 03:36:13.994
THAT THE THE TORRANCE REFINERY

03:36:14.061 --> 03:36:17.130
WAS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY FIND --

03:36:17.197 --> 03:36:18.799
REFINERIES AN INJURED

03:36:18.865 --> 03:36:21.268
JURISDICTION.

03:36:21.335 --> 03:36:22.836
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT FINDS OVERALL

03:36:22.903 --> 03:36:24.571
I KNOW THEY HAVE PAID --

03:36:24.638 --> 03:36:26.273
THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF MITIGATION

03:36:26.340 --> 03:36:28.909
FEES FOR EXCESS FLARING IN THE

03:36:28.975 --> 03:36:30.210
LAST SEVERAL YEARS BY FAR.

03:36:30.277 --> 03:36:31.545
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE THE

03:36:31.611 --> 03:36:33.513
SPECIFIC I DON'T HAVE THE

03:36:33.580 --> 03:36:35.549
ENFORCEMENT NUMBERS ARE

03:36:35.615 --> 03:36:36.416
COMMITTED AND LARGER.

03:36:36.483 --> 03:36:37.918
SO THOSE MEDICATION FEES ARE

03:36:37.984 --> 03:36:41.521
SEPARATE FROM THE THE ENHANCED

03:36:41.588 --> 03:36:42.889
PENALTIES THAT --

03:49:10.169 --> 03:49:11.704

03:49:26.119 --> 03:49:27.854
TALK IN A MINUTE ABOUT HOW WE'RE

03:49:27.920 --> 03:49:29.021
ACTUALLY ALREADY DOING SOME

03:49:29.088 --> 03:49:30.857
EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT ARE

03:49:30.923 --> 03:49:35.628
SIGNIFICANT IN THE AREA --

03:49:35.695 --> 03:49:36.896
SO WITH THE MONITORING PLANS

03:49:36.963 --> 03:49:39.298
WE'RE GONNA BE DOING A VARIETY

03:49:39.365 --> 03:49:42.635
OF THINGS WE WE'RE GONNA MONITOR --

03:49:42.702 --> 03:49:44.837
WE HOPE BETWEEN TWELVE AND

03:49:44.904 --> 03:49:45.638
FIFTEEN LOCATIONS WITH

03:49:45.705 --> 03:49:47.807
STATIONARY EQUIPMENT AND THIS IS

03:49:47.874 --> 03:49:50.977
A REFERENCE METHOD OF MEASURES

03:49:51.043 --> 03:49:52.445
NOT PORTABLE MONGERS PER SE BUT

03:49:52.512 --> 03:49:53.813
TRANSPORTABLE.

03:49:53.880 --> 03:49:55.081
SO FIRST ALL ON THE RIGHT AS I

03:49:55.148 --> 03:49:56.082
MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO WE HAVE A

03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:57.450
COMPANY ALL RIGHT NOW AS OF

03:49:57.517 --> 03:49:58.317
MARCH.

03:49:58.384 --> 03:50:00.086
ONE DRIVING JOHN YOU SAID ALL

03:50:00.153 --> 03:50:01.120
THE ALL THIRTY SEVEN CENSUS

03:50:01.187 --> 03:50:03.189
TRACKS YES OKAY ALL THIRTY SEVEN

03:50:03.256 --> 03:50:04.190
CENSUS TRACKS WITH A PORTABLE

03:50:04.257 --> 03:50:05.825
MONITOR.

03:50:05.892 --> 03:50:07.193
AND THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT

03:50:07.260 --> 03:50:09.028
PARTICULATE MATTER OZONE

03:50:09.095 --> 03:50:11.130
NITROGEN OXIDES CARBON MONOXIDE

03:50:11.197 --> 03:50:12.832
AND CO.

03:50:12.899 --> 03:50:14.967
TWO OF JUST TO SEE WHAT'S OUT

03:50:15.034 --> 03:50:16.502
THERE TO GIVE US A SNAPSHOT IF

03:50:16.569 --> 03:50:17.603
YOU WILL IN THEIR DRIVING EACH

03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:19.539
ROAD TWENTY TIMES IN THE THIRTY

03:50:19.605 --> 03:50:20.840
SEVEN CENSUS TRACKS. TO SEE

03:50:20.907 --> 03:50:22.108
WHAT'S OUT THERE TO SEE WHERE WE

03:50:22.175 --> 03:50:24.076
NEED TO BE LOOKING EVEN IF WE'RE

03:50:24.143 --> 03:50:26.512
NOT CURRENTLY IN THAT AREA WORSE

03:50:26.579 --> 03:50:27.146
FOR IN THE PORTS LIKE COMMUNITY

03:50:27.213 --> 03:50:31.050
RIGHT NOW --

03:50:31.117 --> 03:50:32.685
SO THE COMMITTEE HAS APPROVED SO

03:50:32.752 --> 03:50:35.054
FAR TO MONITORING LOCATIONS AND

03:50:35.121 --> 03:50:36.889
ONE IS -- IN

03:50:36.956 --> 03:50:39.192
THE PORT UP WIND DOWN ONE OF SAN

03:50:39.258 --> 03:50:41.494
DIEGO BAY BUT UP WIND OF THE

03:50:41.561 --> 03:50:42.962
PORT ACTIVITIES THEMSELVES.

03:50:43.029 --> 03:50:44.630
AND THAT'S THE TENTH AVENUE

03:50:44.697 --> 03:50:45.665
MARINE TERMINAL JONES THAT

03:50:45.731 --> 03:50:47.099
CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND

03:50:47.166 --> 03:50:48.467
SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO

03:50:48.534 --> 03:50:49.936
THAT AND ALSO WE HAVE SHERMAN

03:50:50.002 --> 03:50:52.171
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH IS IN

03:50:52.238 --> 03:50:53.406
THE MORE THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF

03:50:53.472 --> 03:50:54.874
THAT AREA CENTRAL SOUTHERN.

03:50:54.941 --> 03:50:56.042
AND WE'RE GONNA HELP WE HAVE A

03:50:56.108 --> 03:50:57.710
FULL BLOWN MONITORING STATION

03:50:57.777 --> 03:50:58.678
THERE --

03:50:58.744 --> 03:50:59.879
THAT WE'RE PUTTING AND WE HAD TO

03:50:59.946 --> 03:51:01.681
MOVE FROM PERKINS ELEMENTARY AND

03:51:01.747 --> 03:51:03.149
IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR LOGIN AREA

03:51:03.216 --> 03:51:04.116
BUT THAT'S A FULL BLOWN

03:51:04.183 --> 03:51:05.184
MONITORING STATION WHICH IS

03:51:05.251 --> 03:51:06.485
GOING TO COUNT TOWARD THIS

03:51:06.552 --> 03:51:08.120
BECAUSE IT IS VERY LOCALIZED.

03:51:08.187 --> 03:51:10.389
AND AGAIN --

03:51:10.456 --> 03:51:11.023
WHAT WE'RE GONNA MEASURE AT THE

03:51:11.090 --> 03:51:13.893
TWO SITES --

03:51:13.960 --> 03:51:16.495
PARTICULATE MATTER BLACK CARBON

03:51:16.562 --> 03:51:18.431
MEANING DIESEL EXHAUST JOHN YOU

03:51:18.497 --> 03:51:19.765
WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT ON THAT

03:51:19.832 --> 03:51:21.500
SO GRADING TOXIC BILL SEES TOXIC

03:51:21.567 --> 03:51:22.969
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS OF BLACK

03:51:23.035 --> 03:51:24.570
CARBON OR DIESEL PARTICULATES

03:51:24.637 --> 03:51:26.339
AND TOXIC METALS.

03:51:26.405 --> 03:51:27.907
IT WAS A TOXIC METALS AND THE

03:51:27.974 --> 03:51:29.375
BLACK CARBON OR DIESEL

03:51:29.442 --> 03:51:30.876
PARTICULATE THAT THE COMMITTEE

03:51:30.943 --> 03:51:34.247
OF THE RESIDENTS WANTED TO SEE

03:51:34.313 --> 03:51:35.414
SO WE INCORPORATED. FOR THAT

03:51:35.481 --> 03:51:37.216
INTO OUR PROGRAM.

03:51:37.283 --> 03:51:38.317
SO WE'RE OFF THE BAT WE'RE NOT

03:51:38.384 --> 03:51:40.853
USING OF INEXPENSIVE OTHERS WERE

03:51:40.920 --> 03:51:42.221
GOING WITH FULL BLOWN REFERENCE

03:51:42.288 --> 03:51:44.190
METHODS THAT WE THINK WILL GIVE

03:51:44.257 --> 03:51:45.291
US.

03:51:45.358 --> 03:51:46.592
REAL DATA THAT'LL HELP US

03:51:46.659 --> 03:51:48.294
DETERMINE ASCERTAIN WHAT THE

03:51:48.361 --> 03:51:49.829
SOURCES ARE OF THOSE POLLUTANTS

03:51:49.895 --> 03:51:51.597
IN THE COMMUNITY --

03:51:51.664 --> 03:51:52.064
WE DO HAVE PURPLE --

03:51:52.131 --> 03:51:53.032
MONITORS HAVE HEARD PEOPLE

03:51:53.099 --> 03:51:54.267
MENTION THAT WE HAVE A FEW THOSE

03:51:54.333 --> 03:51:56.068
WERE TESTING BUT WE REALLY DID

03:51:56.135 --> 03:51:57.737
WANT TO GET A REFERENCE METHOD

03:51:57.803 --> 03:51:59.272
INVOLVES WERE DOING THIS OR

03:51:59.338 --> 03:52:00.306
SPENDING THE MONEY ON THAT AND

03:52:00.373 --> 03:52:00.740
AGAIN.

03:52:00.806 --> 03:52:02.108
JUST TO EMPHASIZE THAT FOR SOME

03:52:02.174 --> 03:52:05.378
OF THE FUNDING IS OBVIOUSLY THE

03:52:05.444 --> 03:52:06.012
TO BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE TO DO

03:52:06.078 --> 03:52:07.346
THAT.

03:52:07.413 --> 03:52:08.547
WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER MONITORING

03:52:08.614 --> 03:52:10.049
SITE OUT IN EL CAJON AT LIKE SIX

03:52:10.116 --> 03:52:11.584
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT'S OUR

03:52:11.651 --> 03:52:12.918
NATIONAL COURSE A WHICH IS A

03:52:12.985 --> 03:52:14.120
COMPREHENSIVE.

03:52:14.186 --> 03:52:15.554
ON EMISSIONS MONITORING

03:52:15.621 --> 03:52:18.124
INCLUDING FOR THE METAL LEAD

03:52:18.190 --> 03:52:19.425
SINCE WE HAVE GILLESPIE FIELD

03:52:19.492 --> 03:52:20.993
AND AIRCRAFT NEARBY.

03:52:21.060 --> 03:52:26.399
AND OF BLACK CARBON AS WELL.

03:52:26.465 --> 03:52:28.234
SO ON A MISSION REDUCTIONS ON

03:52:28.301 --> 03:52:29.669
ALL THE TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE

03:52:29.735 --> 03:52:31.037
BIT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT

03:52:31.103 --> 03:52:32.605
DOING MORE THAN WE WERE DOING

03:52:32.672 --> 03:52:33.606
WE'RE DOING A LOT AND SORE

03:52:33.673 --> 03:52:35.174
CURRENT CURRENT COMMUNITY WAS

03:52:35.241 --> 03:52:35.775
SELECTED FOR MONITORING AS I

03:52:35.841 --> 03:52:36.575
MENTIONED.

03:52:36.642 --> 03:52:37.576
WE HAVE INCREASED STATIONARY

03:52:37.643 --> 03:52:39.078
SOURCE INSPECTIONS WE'VE BEEN

03:52:39.145 --> 03:52:40.479
DOING THAT FOR SO FOR YEARS IN

03:52:40.546 --> 03:52:42.848
THIS AREA BECAUSE WE SEE IN NEED

03:52:42.915 --> 03:52:44.216
BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF

03:52:44.283 --> 03:52:45.117
THE COMMUNITY TO BE OTHER MORE

03:52:45.184 --> 03:52:46.252
FREQUENTLY TO ENSURE THE

03:52:46.319 --> 03:52:46.919
STATIONARY SOURCES.

03:52:46.986 --> 03:52:48.354
ARE IN FACT FULLY COMPLYING WITH

03:52:48.421 --> 03:52:50.623
THE REGULATIONS AND WE RUN A

03:52:50.690 --> 03:52:51.624
VERY AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT

03:52:51.691 --> 03:52:52.024
PROGRAM.

03:52:52.091 --> 03:52:53.893
BUT WE DON'T AS AN ASIDE WE ALSO

03:52:53.959 --> 03:52:57.163
RUN A GRAHAM SO THAT WE CAN

03:52:57.229 --> 03:52:58.631
REALLY DO POLLUTION PREVENTION

03:52:58.698 --> 03:53:00.333
BY HELPING PEOPLE BE EDUCATED

03:53:00.399 --> 03:53:01.667
AND NOT CAUSE A PROBLEM IN THE

03:53:01.734 --> 03:53:02.968
FIRST PLACE --

03:53:03.035 --> 03:53:04.036
FOR INCREASED MOBILE SOURCE

03:53:04.103 --> 03:53:05.771
INSPECTIONS WE HAVE AN MO YOU

03:53:05.838 --> 03:53:07.440
WITH CARB AND WITH THE CHP

03:53:07.506 --> 03:53:09.608
ALLOWING US TO A TRUCK STOPS AND

03:53:09.675 --> 03:53:11.544
INSPECT HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND

03:53:11.610 --> 03:53:13.212
AND FOR DIESEL EMISSIONS AND THE

03:53:13.279 --> 03:53:14.380
TRANSPORT REFRIGERATION UNITS

03:53:14.447 --> 03:53:15.681
WHICH OF THE NCC UP ON THE BACK

03:53:15.748 --> 03:53:16.849
OF THE TRAILERS.

03:53:16.916 --> 03:53:19.251
AND WE'VE DONE OVER FIVE

03:53:19.318 --> 03:53:20.419
THOUSAND OF THOSE KIND OF

03:53:20.486 --> 03:53:21.887
INSPECTIONS LONG WITH OFF ROAD

03:53:21.954 --> 03:53:23.589
DIESEL POWERED EQUIPMENT IT'S

03:53:23.656 --> 03:53:26.092
BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM

03:53:26.158 --> 03:53:29.261
JONES ONE AT ANYTHING ON THAT --

03:53:29.328 --> 03:53:30.730
SO WHAT THE THE HEAVY DUTY

03:53:30.796 --> 03:53:32.298
INSPECTIONS OF BOB MENTIONED

03:53:32.365 --> 03:53:33.432
WOULDN'T WITH CITIES PRETTY

03:53:33.499 --> 03:53:35.935
THOSE ARE AT THE BORDER OF THE

03:53:36.001 --> 03:53:38.804
CENTRAL FREE AND PARADISE AND I

03:53:38.871 --> 03:53:39.872
FIFTEEN FOR ALSO DOING TRUCK

03:53:39.939 --> 03:53:40.840
INSPECTIONS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.

03:53:40.906 --> 03:53:41.741
WE'RE ALSO DOING IDLE

03:53:41.807 --> 03:53:43.309
INSPECTIONS WITHIN THE COMMITTEE

03:53:43.376 --> 03:53:43.876
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT --

03:53:43.943 --> 03:53:45.711
DIANE MIGHT MENTION IS THAT

03:53:45.778 --> 03:53:46.312
THERE'S BEEN A REAL PROBLEM A

03:53:46.379 --> 03:53:48.381
TRUCK TRUCK DRIVING DOWN LOCAL

03:53:48.447 --> 03:53:49.615
ROADS.

03:53:49.682 --> 03:53:50.883
OF AMERICA HEALTH COALITION LONG

03:53:50.950 --> 03:53:52.251
SEE SAN DIEGO CAME UP WITH A

03:53:52.318 --> 03:53:53.319
RULE THAT NO LONGER ALLOWS

03:53:53.386 --> 03:53:55.755
TRUCKS ON CERTAIN ROADS TO ROUTE

03:53:55.821 --> 03:53:56.422
THROUGH A VERIFYING THAT THEY'RE

03:53:56.489 --> 03:53:57.990
NOT DRIVING DOWN THOSE ROADS AND

03:53:58.057 --> 03:53:59.792
PARKING AND IDOLING AND SO.

03:53:59.859 --> 03:54:01.894
WE DO A NUMBER INSPECTIONS THERE

03:54:01.961 --> 03:54:08.434
WE ALSO DO OF OFFROAD EQUIP

03:54:08.501 --> 03:54:09.068
INSPECTIONS WITHIN THE COMEDIAN

03:54:09.135 --> 03:54:12.004
OUTSIDE THE THE VEHICLES COMING

03:54:12.071 --> 03:54:14.540
INTO THE INTO THE COMMUNITY AND

03:54:14.607 --> 03:54:15.875
IMPACT RESIDENTS.

03:54:15.941 --> 03:54:16.709
AND THEN THE LAST --

03:54:16.776 --> 03:54:19.078
DOT POINT ON THAT SLIDE OF THE

03:54:19.145 --> 03:54:20.012
FOURTEEN MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS

03:54:20.079 --> 03:54:21.480
REDUCTION PROJECTS --

03:54:21.547 --> 03:54:22.815
JUST APPROVED FOR INCENTIVE

03:54:22.882 --> 03:54:23.416
FUNDING OF OVER THREE MILLION

03:54:23.482 --> 03:54:25.684
DOLLARS AND OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT

03:54:25.751 --> 03:54:26.652
DURING THE LIFE OF THESE

03:54:26.719 --> 03:54:28.120
PROJECTS AND AND AND THE PROJECT

03:54:28.187 --> 03:54:30.790
LIFE VARIES. FIFTY TONS OF SMOG

03:54:30.856 --> 03:54:32.958
FORMING POLLUTION WILL BE

03:54:33.025 --> 03:54:35.094
ELIMINATED AND THREE POINT SEVEN

03:54:35.161 --> 03:54:36.796
TONS OF PARK FINE PARTICULATE.

03:54:36.862 --> 03:54:38.164
MATTER THAT'S IMPORTANT AND YOU

03:54:38.230 --> 03:54:39.732
KNOW I HEARD OTHERS SAY ZERO

03:54:39.799 --> 03:54:43.235
EMISSIONS WE AGREE.

03:54:43.302 --> 03:54:44.437
MOBILE SOURCES ARE ARE.

03:54:44.503 --> 03:54:45.438
ABOUT 70% OF OUR PROBLEM IN THAT

03:54:45.504 --> 03:54:47.573
AREA AND YOU KNOW WE LOOK

03:54:47.640 --> 03:54:48.741
FORWARD TO CONTINUING THESE

03:54:48.808 --> 03:54:50.342
PROJECTS JOHN WAS A POOR SAN

03:54:50.409 --> 03:54:52.077
DIEGO MEETING JUST LAST WEEK.

03:54:52.144 --> 03:54:53.813
AND THAT THEY'RE FINALLY

03:54:53.879 --> 03:54:55.381
STEPPING UP WE HOPE TO THE PLATE

03:54:55.448 --> 03:54:56.782
TO LOOK FOR GRANT MONEY THAT WE

03:54:56.849 --> 03:54:58.384
HAVE TO OFFER AND DO SOME

03:54:58.451 --> 03:55:00.319
PROJECTS THAT WILL REALLY HELP

03:55:00.386 --> 03:55:03.689
OUT THIS COMMUNITY. TEN KEY

03:55:03.756 --> 03:55:04.824
POINT HERE IS CONTINUED FUNDING

03:55:04.890 --> 03:55:07.259
IT'S EXPENSIVE WE CANNOT BILL OR

03:55:07.326 --> 03:55:09.261
STATIONARY SOURCES AND LESS FOR

03:55:09.328 --> 03:55:09.995
DOING SO.

03:55:10.062 --> 03:55:11.564
IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A TAXES I

03:55:11.630 --> 03:55:13.966
HEARD ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA SAY.

03:55:14.033 --> 03:55:15.267
UNLESS IT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO

03:55:15.334 --> 03:55:17.269
THEM AND SO THE FUNDING FROM THE

03:55:17.336 --> 03:55:18.571
STATE IS KEY.

03:55:18.637 --> 03:55:20.372
YOU KNOW IT WE LIKE DOING THIS

03:55:20.439 --> 03:55:22.575
PROGRAM WE'VE LONG SCENE IN NEED

03:55:22.641 --> 03:55:24.543
FOR IT AND I'M GLAD SIX ONE

03:55:24.610 --> 03:55:25.678

SO WE'RE HERE FOR QUESTIONS AND

03:56:07.520 --> 03:56:11.724
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

03:56:17.763 --> 03:56:18.898
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COALITION

03:56:18.964 --> 03:56:20.232
AND WE'RE A MEMBER OF THE SAN

03:56:20.299 --> 03:56:21.534
DIEGO PORT SIDE --

03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:23.235
COMMUNITIES PROJECT COORDINATED

03:56:23.302 --> 03:56:24.703
BY THE SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION

03:56:24.770 --> 03:56:26.338
CONTROL DISTRICT --

03:56:26.405 --> 03:56:28.541
I ALSO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE

03:56:28.607 --> 03:56:29.909
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD

03:56:29.975 --> 03:56:31.510
AS YOU MAY KNOW --

03:56:31.577 --> 03:56:33.012
AND ITS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE THAT

03:56:33.078 --> 03:56:34.346
I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE

03:56:34.413 --> 03:56:36.048
OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN BOTH

03:56:36.115 --> 03:56:37.316
CAPACITIES BUT TODAY I'M

BUT NO MATTER WHAT ROLE AYE MAN --

03:56:42.288 --> 03:56:42.755
I THINK THAT MY JOB IS TO

03:56:42.821 --> 03:56:45.691
IMPROVE COMMUNITIES JUST LIKE

03:56:45.758 --> 03:56:46.692
THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:56:46.759 --> 03:56:48.561
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:56:48.627 --> 03:56:49.828
BEFORE YOU TODAY.

03:56:49.895 --> 03:56:52.431
I THINK AB SIX SEVENTEEN

03:56:52.498 --> 03:56:54.199
REPRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY

03:56:54.266 --> 03:56:56.702
AND AN INTEGRATED OPPORTUNITY TO

03:56:56.769 --> 03:56:58.604
LOOK AT HEALTH AND CUT AND THE

03:56:58.671 --> 03:57:00.639
QUALITY OF LIFE IN COMMUNITIES --

03:57:00.706 --> 03:57:02.241
BECAUSE IT'S INTEGRATED.

03:57:02.308 --> 03:57:03.509
AND HOLISTIC --

03:57:03.576 --> 03:57:05.110
I JUST WANT TO SAY FROM THE

03:57:05.177 --> 03:57:06.211
BEGINNING AND I'LL SAY IT

03:57:06.278 --> 03:57:07.046
PROBABLY MULTIPLE TIMES IS

03:57:07.112 --> 03:57:08.314
COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ARE NOT

03:57:08.380 --> 03:57:10.049
INTERESTED IN --

03:57:10.115 --> 03:57:12.084
ENGAGING IN CONTINUED ARGUMENTS

03:57:12.151 --> 03:57:13.652
ABOUT WHAT SOURCES OF POLLUTION

03:57:13.719 --> 03:57:15.321
ARE THE WORST AND WHICH ONES

03:57:15.387 --> 03:57:16.789
WERE GOING TO CHOOSE FROM --

03:57:16.855 --> 03:57:18.657
THEY WANTCLEAN AIR NOW --

03:57:18.724 --> 03:57:20.225
AND THEY WANT ACTION TO BE TAKEN

03:57:20.292 --> 03:57:23.028
SO PART OF MY GOAL TODAY IS TO

03:57:23.095 --> 03:57:24.330
SHOW YOU --

03:57:24.396 --> 03:57:26.465
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS

03:57:26.532 --> 03:57:27.466
OF THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

03:57:27.533 --> 03:57:29.435
DONE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WHAT

03:57:29.501 --> 03:57:31.136
WE'D LIKE TO SEE GOING FORWARD

03:57:31.203 --> 03:57:33.372
SO AS A BOB ILLUSTRATED THESE

03:57:33.439 --> 03:57:34.840
ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE

03:57:34.907 --> 03:57:37.109
FOCUSING ON IN THE PORT SIDE

03:57:37.176 --> 03:57:37.576
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:57:37.643 --> 03:57:38.711
COMMUNITIES?

03:57:38.777 --> 03:57:40.212
THESE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS AT RISK

03:57:40.279 --> 03:57:41.914
AND THIS GIVES YOU AN OVERLAY OF

03:57:41.981 --> 03:57:44.183
THE COUNT ON VIRUS SCREEN --

03:57:44.249 --> 03:57:45.884
WITH THE PORT SIDE COMMUNITY SO

03:57:45.951 --> 03:57:47.553
WANT YOU TO SEE --

03:57:47.620 --> 03:57:49.488
THAT THESE ARE SOME OF THE

03:57:49.555 --> 03:57:51.357
CENSUS TRACKS HERE ARE IN THE

03:57:51.423 --> 03:57:52.491
TOP 5% IN THE STATE OF

03:57:52.558 --> 03:57:54.159
CALIFORNIA FOR IMPACTS SO THIS

03:57:54.226 --> 03:57:55.260
IS PART OF THE REASON THAT THEY

03:57:55.327 --> 03:57:56.328
WERE SELECTED.

03:57:56.395 --> 03:57:57.796
AND THESE ARE THE CHALLENGES

03:57:57.863 --> 03:57:58.731
THAT THESE --

03:57:58.797 --> 03:58:01.033
COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE ONE OF

03:58:01.100 --> 03:58:04.637
THE DIESEL EMISSIONS THAT ARE

03:58:04.703 --> 03:58:06.538
OCCURRING IN THESE COMMUNITIES

03:58:06.605 --> 03:58:08.107
THAT ARE DRIVING --

03:58:08.173 --> 03:58:09.808
DRIVING THE AIR POLLUTION AND

03:58:09.875 --> 03:58:11.276
DRIVING THE UNACCEPTABLE

03:58:11.343 --> 03:58:13.178
UNACCEPTABLE IMPACT IN OUR

03:58:13.245 --> 03:58:15.381
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE RESULTED

03:58:15.447 --> 03:58:17.783
IN CHILDREN'S ASTHMA E. R. RATES

03:58:17.850 --> 03:58:21.186
AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF THE

03:58:21.253 --> 03:58:22.655
COUNTY WIDE AVERAGE.

03:58:22.721 --> 03:58:25.591
AND OF THE FREEWAYS IS WHAT THE

03:58:25.658 --> 03:58:27.459
FREEWAYS IN ADDITION TO THE

03:58:27.526 --> 03:58:28.994
STATIONARY SOURCES INDUSTRIAL

03:58:29.061 --> 03:58:31.130
SOURCES ARE ARE SOME OF THE

03:58:31.196 --> 03:58:33.232
CAUSES FOR THIS --

03:58:33.298 --> 03:58:35.567
THIS MOST RECENT DATA IS FROM

03:58:35.634 --> 03:58:37.169
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS

03:58:37.236 --> 03:58:39.371
AND THESE E. R. ASTHMA RATES ARE

03:58:39.438 --> 03:58:41.540
HIGHER THAN 92% OF THE CENSUS

03:58:41.607 --> 03:58:42.474
TRACKS IN THE STATE OF

03:58:42.541 --> 03:58:43.976
CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE A SERIOUS

03:58:44.043 --> 03:58:44.677
PROBLEM.

03:58:44.743 --> 03:58:46.845
WITH CHILDREN'S HEALTH WE ALSO

03:58:46.912 --> 03:58:47.713
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LIFE

03:58:47.780 --> 03:58:49.682
EXPECTANCY AS YOU CAN SEE FROM

03:58:49.748 --> 03:58:51.316
THIS -- WE

03:58:51.383 --> 03:58:52.584
HAVE SOME --

03:58:52.651 --> 03:58:54.219
LIFE EXPECTANCY THAT'S QUITE

03:58:54.286 --> 03:58:56.522
REDUCED FROM THE COUNTY AVERAGE

03:58:56.588 --> 03:58:58.857
IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES --

03:58:58.924 --> 03:59:00.659
THESE PORT SIDE COMMUNITIES AND

03:59:00.726 --> 03:59:02.294
BURIAL LOGAN AND NATIONAL CITY

03:59:02.361 --> 03:59:04.963
IT SIX TIMES LESS THAN IT IS FOR

03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.998
THE COUNTY AVERAGE WARS Là

03:59:06.065 --> 03:59:07.399
HORIA --

03:59:07.466 --> 03:59:08.100
WHICH IS A WHITE AND MORE

03:59:08.167 --> 03:59:09.935
AFFLUENT COMMUNITY AND NOT

03:59:10.002 --> 03:59:11.437
IMPACTED BY THIS POLLUTION THEY

03:59:11.503 --> 03:59:13.539
GET -- FOUR

03:59:13.605 --> 03:59:14.039
TIMES MORE --

03:59:14.106 --> 03:59:18.844
YEARS OF FOUR TIMES MORE YEARS

03:59:18.911 --> 03:59:22.981
TWO MEN OF MY MAN OUR THE PEOPLE

03:59:23.048 --> 03:59:24.650
OF COLOR FAMILIES IN POVERTY AND

03:59:24.717 --> 03:59:26.051
LARGELY RANCHERS AND YOUNG

03:59:26.118 --> 03:59:28.020
POPULATIONS AND I THINK THESE

03:59:28.087 --> 03:59:29.521
PROFILES MATCH A LOT OF THE

03:59:29.588 --> 03:59:31.323
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

03:59:31.390 --> 03:59:32.758
INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM.

03:59:32.825 --> 03:59:34.460
OUR COMMUNITIES MEMBERS HAVE

03:59:34.526 --> 03:59:36.462
CLEARLY BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT A

03:59:36.528 --> 03:59:38.397
VARIETY OF AIRBORNE SOURCES OF

03:59:38.464 --> 03:59:39.965
POLLUTION --

03:59:40.032 --> 03:59:42.367
FROM TRUCKS AND SHIPS FROM

03:59:42.434 --> 03:59:45.270
INCOMPATIBLE LAND USES --

03:59:45.337 --> 03:59:47.806
TO TO AND ACCIDENTS THAT ARE

03:59:47.873 --> 03:59:49.374
OCCURRING IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

03:59:49.441 --> 03:59:50.676
YOU'VE TALKED.

03:59:50.743 --> 03:59:52.845
A LOT TODAY ABOUT INCOMPATIBLE

03:59:52.911 --> 03:59:54.847
LAND USE AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE

03:59:54.913 --> 03:59:57.716
IN MARIO LOGAN WHERE WE HAVE A

03:59:57.783 --> 03:59:59.151
PRAXAIR FACILITY --

03:59:59.218 --> 04:00:00.119
THAT HAD HAS HUNDREDS OF

04:00:00.185 --> 04:00:03.455
THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF OF OF

04:00:03.522 --> 04:00:05.157
MATERIAL AS WELL AS COMPRESSED

04:00:05.224 --> 04:00:06.258
GAS --

04:00:06.325 --> 04:00:08.093
THAT'S LOCATED RIGHT ACROSS THE

04:00:08.160 --> 04:00:10.429
STREET FROM A HOME OF FACILITY

04:00:10.496 --> 04:00:11.530
LIKE THIS --

04:00:11.597 --> 04:00:13.565
HAD AN EXTREME FIRE IN THE

04:00:13.632 --> 04:00:15.501
MIDWEST THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY

04:00:15.567 --> 04:00:17.369
NO HOMES THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY

04:00:17.436 --> 04:00:19.037
MILES OF EMPTY LAND --

04:00:19.104 --> 04:00:20.973
AND WORKERS WERE INJURED BUT NO

04:00:21.039 --> 04:00:22.574
RESIDENTS WERE INJURED SO YOU

04:00:22.641 --> 04:00:24.009
CAN IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

04:00:24.076 --> 04:00:25.677
HERE IF THAT SAME KIND OF

04:00:25.744 --> 04:00:27.646
ACCIDENT WERE TO OCCUR WE ALSO

04:00:27.713 --> 04:00:29.181
HAVE BUSINESSES IN THE COMMUNITY

04:00:29.248 --> 04:00:30.449
AS JOHN MENTIONED THAT ARE

04:00:30.516 --> 04:00:31.416
ATTRACTING.

04:00:31.483 --> 04:00:34.186
HEAVY DUTY DIESEL TRUCKS THIS

04:00:34.253 --> 04:00:35.521
PHOTO WAS TAKEN FROM US

04:00:35.587 --> 04:00:37.523
APARTMENT IN A SENIOR COMMUNITY

04:00:37.589 --> 04:00:39.024
COMPLEX WHERE WE HAVE AN AIR

04:00:39.091 --> 04:00:39.958
MONITORING.

04:00:40.025 --> 04:00:40.993
DEVICE --

04:00:41.059 --> 04:00:43.929
THIS IS WHAT GOES ON THESE

04:00:43.996 --> 04:00:45.230
TRUCKS ARE COMING IN AND OUT.

04:00:45.297 --> 04:00:47.232
WE'RE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF

04:00:47.299 --> 04:00:49.001
RECYCLING FACILITIES --

04:00:49.067 --> 04:00:50.502
THAT ARE LOCATED IN A COMMUNITY

04:00:50.569 --> 04:00:52.604
LIKE THIS ONE AND THIS IS WHAT

04:00:52.671 --> 04:00:54.306
HAPPENED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IT

04:00:54.373 --> 04:00:55.040
BLEW UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

04:00:55.107 --> 04:00:56.675
NIGHT -- AND

04:00:56.742 --> 04:01:00.045
OF THE FIRE WENT ON FOR FOR

04:01:00.112 --> 04:01:01.079
QUITE SOME TIME.

04:01:01.146 --> 04:01:02.447
THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO IS

04:01:02.514 --> 04:01:04.349
CRITICAL --

04:01:04.416 --> 04:01:06.285
TO ALLOWING US TO REALLY HAVE

04:01:06.351 --> 04:01:08.086
EMISSION REDUCTIONS TO OTHER IT

04:01:08.153 --> 04:01:10.923
THE CARGO TERMINALS ARE RUN BY

04:01:10.989 --> 04:01:13.926
THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO AS WELL AS

04:01:13.992 --> 04:01:16.628
THE PORT BEING A LANDLORD --

04:01:16.695 --> 04:01:18.430
TO SOME FOUR HUNDRED BUSINESSES

04:01:18.497 --> 04:01:20.432
INCLUDING LARGE FACILITIES LIKE

04:01:20.499 --> 04:01:21.934
THIS SHIP YARD --

04:01:22.000 --> 04:01:24.203
WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE IS LOCATED

04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:26.305
RIGHT ADJACENT --

04:01:26.371 --> 04:01:27.840
TO THE OF THE RESIDENTIAL

04:01:27.906 --> 04:01:29.708
COMMUNITIES --

04:01:29.775 --> 04:01:31.343
WE ALSO HAVE THE TENTH AVENUE

04:01:31.410 --> 04:01:32.978
TERMINAL WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT

04:01:33.045 --> 04:01:34.980
SOURCE OF EMISSIONS --

04:01:35.047 --> 04:01:37.182
DOLE IS THE LARGEST TENANT THERE

04:01:37.249 --> 04:01:38.684
THE IMPORT ABOUT TWO BILLION

04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:41.386
BANANAS A YEAR CLOSE TO A

04:01:41.453 --> 04:01:44.389
THOUSAND TRUCK TRIPS EVERY WEEK --

04:01:44.456 --> 04:01:47.292
AND IN NATIONAL CITY --

04:01:47.359 --> 04:01:48.527
WE HAVE ABOUT ONE OUT OF CARS

04:01:48.594 --> 04:01:53.265
THAT THROUGH THIS TERMINAL --

04:01:53.332 --> 04:01:55.367
RESULTING IN ABOUT A HALF A

04:01:55.434 --> 04:01:57.336
MILLION CARS A YEAR AND

04:01:57.402 --> 04:01:58.937
THOUSANDS OF TRUCK TRIPS --

04:01:59.004 --> 04:02:00.405
EACH MONTH.

04:02:00.472 --> 04:02:02.908
SO THE ONLY PUBLIC PARK ON THE

04:02:02.975 --> 04:02:04.409
NATIONAL CITY WATERFRONT IS

04:02:04.476 --> 04:02:05.911
RIGHT HERE --

04:02:05.978 --> 04:02:07.713
WHERE THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS GET

04:02:07.779 --> 04:02:09.581
TO SHARE THE PARK WITH THE

04:02:09.648 --> 04:02:11.650
INCOMING SHIPS WITH ALL THE?

04:02:11.717 --> 04:02:13.385
ALL THE TRUCKS NIGHT EXCUSE ME

04:02:13.452 --> 04:02:14.920
HOW THE CARS --

04:02:14.987 --> 04:02:17.189
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A REAL

04:02:17.256 --> 04:02:18.490
REAL YARD --

04:02:18.557 --> 04:02:20.559
WHICH CREATES CANCER RISKS OF

04:02:20.626 --> 04:02:22.160
ABOUT FIFTY TO A HUNDRED PER

04:02:22.227 --> 04:02:24.329
MILLION AT THE LOCAL ELEMENTARY

04:02:24.396 --> 04:02:25.430
SCHOOL.

04:02:25.497 --> 04:02:27.666
SO WE KNOW A LOT AND I THINK

04:02:27.733 --> 04:02:29.434
THAT'S MY MAIN MESSAGE HERE --

04:02:29.501 --> 04:02:31.670
IS THAT WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT

04:02:31.737 --> 04:02:32.838
MONITORING PROGRAMS AND WE

04:02:32.905 --> 04:02:34.106
SUPPORT THOSE AND WE'RE

04:02:34.172 --> 04:02:35.607
CONDUCTING SOME OURSELVES WE

04:02:35.674 --> 04:02:37.676
KNOW A LOT AND WE CAN BEGIN TO

04:02:37.743 --> 04:02:40.145
TAKE ACTION AND THE COMMUNITY

04:02:40.212 --> 04:02:41.780
HAS ALREADY STARTED TO DO THAT.

04:02:41.847 --> 04:02:44.216
SO OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE

04:02:44.283 --> 04:02:46.752
BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES AS THESE

04:02:46.818 --> 04:02:47.552
TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE

04:02:47.619 --> 04:02:50.322
SAYING.

04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:51.323
AND WHILE COMMUNITY.

04:02:51.390 --> 04:02:52.291
ABOUT AIR POLLUTION HAS NOT

04:02:52.357 --> 04:02:53.992
SIGNIFICANTLY --

04:02:54.059 --> 04:02:55.394
IMPROVED IN OUR COMMUNITIES

04:02:55.460 --> 04:02:56.962
COMMUNITY RESIDENTS KEEP COMING

04:02:57.029 --> 04:02:58.797
UP WITH IDEAS FOR HOW THESE

04:02:58.864 --> 04:03:00.465
THINGS CAN CHANGE --

04:03:00.532 --> 04:03:02.301
LIKE SEPARATING INDUSTRIES FROM

04:03:02.367 --> 04:03:04.002
RESIDENTIAL AND SCHOOL AREAS

04:03:04.069 --> 04:03:05.537
WHICH DOESN'T ACTUALLY REDUCE --

04:03:05.604 --> 04:03:07.272
POLLUTION BUT IT DOES REDUCE

04:03:07.339 --> 04:03:10.609
THEIR EXPOSURE OBVIOUSLY --

04:03:10.676 --> 04:03:13.445
WE HAVE HAD --

04:03:13.512 --> 04:03:15.080
TO HAVE A OF SUCCESSFULLY

04:03:15.147 --> 04:03:16.248
ADOPTED --

04:03:16.315 --> 04:03:18.216
GOTTEN ADOPTION OF THE WEST SIDE

04:03:18.283 --> 04:03:20.152
SPECIFIC PLAN IN NATIONAL CITY

04:03:20.218 --> 04:03:21.720
WHICH ACTUALLY CHANGES THE

04:03:21.787 --> 04:03:22.621
ZONING.

04:03:22.688 --> 04:03:25.190
SO WHILE WE HAVEN'T HAD.

04:03:25.257 --> 04:03:27.626
MUCH SUPPORT FROM --

04:03:27.693 --> 04:03:28.961
THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT IN THIS

04:03:29.027 --> 04:03:31.530
REGARD BOOK THIS IS THE PURVIEW

04:03:31.596 --> 04:03:32.931
OF THE LOCAL --

04:03:32.998 --> 04:03:35.167
CITY THEY HAVE GONE FORWARD TO

04:03:35.233 --> 04:03:37.202
TAKE THESE ACTIONS SO I GUESS

04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:38.737
GIVEN YOUR CONVERSATION I WANT

04:03:38.804 --> 04:03:40.238
YOU TO KNOW THAT CITIES ARE

04:03:40.305 --> 04:03:41.540
STEPPING UP --

04:03:41.606 --> 04:03:42.941
TO TAKE THESE ACTIONS BUT THEY

04:03:43.008 --> 04:03:44.810
NEED THE HELP OF THE LOCAL AIR

04:03:44.876 --> 04:03:46.378
DISTRICTS AND THEY NEED HELP --

04:03:46.445 --> 04:03:48.780
FROM CARP IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS

04:03:48.847 --> 04:03:49.948
THIS HAPPEN --

04:03:50.015 --> 04:03:52.050
WE ACTUALLY DID UTILIZED THE

04:03:52.117 --> 04:03:54.119
LAND USE GUIDANCE THE CAR HAD --

04:03:54.186 --> 04:03:55.821
DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO GIVE

04:03:55.887 --> 04:03:57.923
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS KIND OF

04:03:57.990 --> 04:04:01.126
LAND USE CHANGE --

04:04:01.193 --> 04:04:01.793
SO.

04:04:01.860 --> 04:04:02.661
I THINK THE OTHER THING IS IS

04:04:02.728 --> 04:04:04.062
THAT NATIONAL CITY HAS ADOPTED

04:04:04.129 --> 04:04:06.832
AN AMORTIZATION ORDINANCE WHICH

04:04:06.898 --> 04:04:10.102
RANKED ALL OF THE HUNDRED AND

04:04:10.168 --> 04:04:11.937
FIFTY UP POLLUTION SOURCES NEAR

04:04:12.004 --> 04:04:14.172
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND BEGAN

04:04:14.239 --> 04:04:16.074
A PHASE OUT PROCESS --

04:04:16.141 --> 04:04:18.076
SO THAT THESE FACILITIES WOULD

04:04:18.143 --> 04:04:19.945
BE PHASED OUT AS NONCONFORMING

04:04:20.012 --> 04:04:21.079
USES.

04:04:21.146 --> 04:04:22.214
SO --

04:04:22.280 --> 04:04:25.851
COMMUNITIES DOING A LOT THEY

04:04:25.917 --> 04:04:28.520
WANTED A SIGN IN MORRELL AND SO

04:04:28.587 --> 04:04:30.455
THAT IT WOULD SERVICE TRUCK

04:04:30.522 --> 04:04:31.957
MEDICATION --

04:04:32.024 --> 04:04:35.193
BOOKS ARE CREATIVE AND WE DID

04:04:35.260 --> 04:04:36.762
RECENTLY GET A TRUCK ROUTE

04:04:36.828 --> 04:04:37.896
ADOPTED --

04:04:37.963 --> 04:04:40.265
IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO SO THAT --

04:04:40.332 --> 04:04:41.733
THEY WOULDN'T BE GOING THROUGH

04:04:41.800 --> 04:04:44.136
THE RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY WE DID

04:04:44.202 --> 04:04:45.337
CHANGE -- A

04:04:45.404 --> 04:04:47.639
HAZARDOUS WASTE YARD RIGHT NEXT

04:04:47.706 --> 04:04:49.641
TO THIS CREEK IN TO TWO HUNDRED

04:04:49.708 --> 04:04:51.043
AND ONE AFFORDABLE HOUSING --

04:04:51.109 --> 04:04:52.677
UNITS WITH THE HELP OF THE G. G.

04:04:52.744 --> 04:04:53.745
R. F. FUNDS.

04:04:53.812 --> 04:04:55.047
BUT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WANT

04:04:55.113 --> 04:04:56.548
CLEAN AIR AND THAT'S NOT

04:04:56.615 --> 04:04:58.950
HAPPENING AND THEY HAVE ASKED

04:04:59.017 --> 04:05:00.619
OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR IT TO

04:05:00.685 --> 04:05:03.088
HAPPEN I THINK SIX SEVENTEEN IS

04:05:03.155 --> 04:05:04.322
A REAL OPPORTUNITY.

04:05:04.389 --> 04:05:06.391
AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT I

04:05:06.458 --> 04:05:07.726
THINK THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL

04:05:07.793 --> 04:05:09.628
DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO IS HELPING

04:05:09.694 --> 04:05:10.462
TO CREATE.

04:05:10.529 --> 04:05:12.764
OF A SYSTEM IN A FRAMEWORK FOR

04:05:12.831 --> 04:05:14.399
IT TO HAPPEN BUT FRANKLY OUR

04:05:14.466 --> 04:05:16.401
CONCERNS ARE THAT THE STAFF OF

04:05:16.468 --> 04:05:17.302
THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL

04:05:17.369 --> 04:05:18.904
DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO IS QUITE

04:05:18.970 --> 04:05:19.971
DIFFERENT IN THE BOARD.

04:05:20.038 --> 04:05:21.506
OF THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL

04:05:21.573 --> 04:05:23.341
DISTRICT AND IN ORDER TO GET THE

04:05:23.408 --> 04:05:25.210
EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT FOLKS

04:05:25.277 --> 04:05:27.045
REALLY WANT LIKE THESE --

04:05:27.112 --> 04:05:29.748
THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR REPEATEDLY

04:05:29.815 --> 04:05:31.783
WE'RE GONNA NEED NEW RULES WE'RE

04:05:31.850 --> 04:05:32.350

04:05:32.417 --> 04:05:35.353
STRONG AUTHORITY FROM I NEED

04:05:35.420 --> 04:05:39.324
HELP SOURCES BOARD IN ORDER FOR

04:05:39.391 --> 04:05:41.760
THESE SOURCES TO BE REDUCED AND

04:05:41.827 --> 04:05:43.295
EMISSION REDUCTIONS IS REALLY

04:05:43.361 --> 04:05:44.563
WHERE IT'S AT AND THEY'VE REALLY

04:05:44.629 --> 04:05:47.399
APPRECIATED THE EMPHASIS ON THAT --

04:05:47.466 --> 04:05:49.167
IN BOTH OUR LOCAL COMMITTEE AS

04:05:49.234 --> 04:05:51.269
WELL AS HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL

04:05:51.336 --> 04:05:55.140
WE WE REALLY FEEL STRONGLY THAT

04:05:55.207 --> 04:05:57.242
THAT THE PORT SOURCES AND THE

04:05:57.309 --> 04:05:59.744
SHIPS AND SHIPYARDS AND THE NAVY

04:05:59.811 --> 04:06:02.481

04:06:08.120 --> 04:06:09.321
WE ARE --

04:06:09.387 --> 04:06:11.123
APPRECIATIVE THAT THE PORT OF

SAN DIEGO HAS SIGNALED TO THEIR

STAFF THAT CLEAN AIR PLAN SHOULD

BE DEVELOPED IN THAT JUST

04:06:16.528 --> 04:06:18.396

THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT.

04:06:19.865 --> 04:06:21.399
THE SIX SEVENTEEN PUSH I THINK

04:06:21.466 --> 04:06:23.001
THAT'S A DIRECT RESULT AND WE

04:06:23.068 --> 04:06:24.169

04:14:01.459 --> 04:14:02.994
THAN SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO THEY

04:14:03.061 --> 04:14:04.896
DO HAVE SOME OF THE SAME

04:14:04.963 --> 04:14:06.731
CONCERNS BUT THEN THEY ALSO HAVE

04:14:06.798 --> 04:14:07.532
SOME CONCERNS.

04:14:07.599 --> 04:14:10.134
BUT THEY POUR IT PRIORITIZE MUCH

04:14:10.201 --> 04:14:11.336
DIFFERENTLY.

04:14:11.402 --> 04:14:12.170
THIS CHAPTER COMMUNITY STEERING

04:14:12.236 --> 04:14:14.172

THAT THE COMMUNITY THOUGHT.

04:14:26.551 --> 04:14:27.285

04:14:27.352 --> 04:14:29.153
NEEDED TO BE DISCUSSED NUMBER

04:14:29.220 --> 04:14:31.422
ONE IN CHAPTERS PESTICIDES AND

04:14:31.489 --> 04:14:33.124
WE'VE ALREADY INVITED AND AT OUR

THINGS THAT THEY WERE ALL WE

04:14:40.064 --> 04:14:41.032
FEEL THAT THERE'S LOTS OF

04:14:41.099 --> 04:14:42.700
OPPORTUNITIES THERE TO BRING THE

04:14:42.767 --> 04:14:44.636

I WOULD SAY THAT WE ALL ARE

04:15:08.860 --> 04:15:09.494

TOGETHER CHAPTER I THINK IT'S

04:15:18.169 --> 04:15:20.104
BEEN INCREDIBLY POSITIVE ONE OF

04:15:20.171 --> 04:15:21.439
THE OTHER THINGS BASED ON A

04:15:21.506 --> 04:15:22.607
RECOMMENDATION OF ONE OF THE

FULLY INTO THE DETAILS ABOUT

04:15:29.080 --> 04:15:30.948
WHERE THE MONITOR SHOULD GO BUT

04:15:31.015 --> 04:15:32.517
WE AGREED WE NEEDED A PARTICULAR

04:15:32.583 --> 04:15:33.818

SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO IT'S A MUCH

04:15:47.065 --> 04:15:48.633
DIFFERENT AREA --

04:15:48.700 --> 04:15:49.834
IT'S MORE INDUSTRIAL MORE

04:15:49.901 --> 04:15:51.969
DENSELY POPULATED IS THAT IT IS

04:15:52.036 --> 04:15:53.671
ABOUT FOURTEEN SQUARE MILES BUT

04:15:53.738 --> 04:15:54.939
A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THE

04:15:55.006 --> 04:15:56.040
BLUE LINE.

04:15:56.107 --> 04:15:57.709

THE BOUNDARY THAT MAKES THE MOST

04:16:06.184 --> 04:16:07.585
SENSE GIVEN THE LIMITED

04:16:07.652 --> 04:16:09.053
RESOURCES IN REALLY.

04:16:09.120 --> 04:16:10.988

ABOUT AIR MONITORING PLANS.

04:17:47.251 --> 04:17:50.621
EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS.

THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT AND I

04:17:52.056 --> 04:17:53.224
DID WANT TO POINT THIS OUT WE'VE

04:17:53.291 --> 04:17:55.593
GOT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TOOLS

04:17:55.660 --> 04:17:57.728
THIS IS R. SHAFTER WEBSITE IT

04:17:57.795 --> 04:17:59.864

THE NEW CHAPTER PM MONITOR THAT

04:18:08.973 --> 04:18:11.509
WE PUT IN ABOUT A MONTH AGO THAT

04:18:11.576 --> 04:18:13.444

04:18:13.511 --> 04:18:14.078
AND I'M GONNA TURN BACK OVER TO

04:18:14.145 --> 04:18:16.514
SMEAR SORRY I DID TRY TO BE VERY

04:18:16.581 --> 04:18:18.916
FAST LIKE THAT.

04:18:18.983 --> 04:18:20.284
WE'LL GET DOWN HERE --

04:18:20.351 --> 04:18:21.719
SO YOU'VE HEARD THE STEAM WITHIN

04:18:21.786 --> 04:18:23.354
A COUPLE TIME TODAY YOU KNOW

04:18:23.421 --> 04:18:25.423
WE'RE WE'RE NOT WAITING TO TO

04:18:25.489 --> 04:18:26.490
INVEST IN CLEAN AIR.

04:18:26.557 --> 04:18:28.626
I PROJECTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES

04:18:28.693 --> 04:18:30.561
IN AND AROUND THESE COMMUNITIES --

04:18:30.628 --> 04:18:31.896
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

04:18:31.963 --> 04:18:32.230
BEEN DOING --

04:18:32.296 --> 04:18:35.066
IS REALLY SPEED ON THE

04:18:35.132 --> 04:18:36.567
INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

04:18:36.634 --> 04:18:37.835
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES I THINK

04:18:37.902 --> 04:18:39.203
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR THEM

04:18:39.270 --> 04:18:41.339
TO SEE THAT IF YOU CAN COME UP

04:18:41.405 --> 04:18:42.573
WITH CREATIVE STRATEGIES IF YOU

04:18:42.640 --> 04:18:44.041
HAVE A MODEL FOR HOW YOU CAN

04:18:44.108 --> 04:18:44.909
ACTUALLY DO SOME OF THESE THINGS

04:18:44.976 --> 04:18:45.443
WITH.

04:18:45.509 --> 04:18:47.478
WITH BUSINESSES WITH AGENCIES

04:18:47.545 --> 04:18:48.112
WITH RESIDENTS DEPENDING ON THE

04:18:48.179 --> 04:18:49.513
SCALE OF OF PROJECTS YOU'RE

04:18:49.580 --> 04:18:50.481
TALKING ABOUT THERE.

04:18:50.548 --> 04:18:51.816
IT REALLY HELPS THAT SOURCE AT

04:18:51.883 --> 04:18:53.050
THIS STAGE FOR GETTING MORE

04:18:53.117 --> 04:18:54.085
INPUT AS TO HOW MUCH MORE WE

04:18:54.151 --> 04:18:54.819
COULD DO WITH ALL THE NEW

04:18:54.886 --> 04:18:56.988
FUNDING AND RESOURCES THAT ARE

04:18:57.054 --> 04:18:58.322
COMING TO BEAR THROUGH THIS

04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.856
PROCESS.

04:18:58.923 --> 04:18:59.824
THIS COULD BE A KIND OF A

04:18:59.891 --> 04:19:01.225
SNAPSHOT IN THE CHAPTER AREA

04:19:01.292 --> 04:19:01.959
JUST A STORE WITH THEIR

04:19:02.026 --> 04:19:02.960
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ALONE WE'VE

04:19:03.027 --> 04:19:04.428
BEEN ABLE INVEST ABOUT TWENTY

04:19:04.495 --> 04:19:06.097
MILLION DOLLARS. FOURTEEN

04:19:06.163 --> 04:19:07.598
HUNDRED PROJECTS AND THIRTY

SEVEN HUNDRED TONS OF EMISSIONS

04:19:08.299 --> 04:19:09.300
REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED.

04:19:09.367 --> 04:19:11.235
IN THAT AREA SO FAR JUST IN THE

04:19:11.302 --> 04:19:12.403
SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO AREA ABOUT

04:19:12.470 --> 04:19:14.338
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS NINETY

04:19:14.405 --> 04:19:15.206
TWO HUNDRED PROJECTS AND NINE

04:19:15.273 --> 04:19:16.274
THOUSAND TONS OF REDUCTIONS WE

04:19:16.340 --> 04:19:17.541
HAVE A REALLY.

04:19:17.608 --> 04:19:19.477
GOOD TRACK RECORD OF GOING INTO

04:19:19.543 --> 04:19:21.045
COMMUNITIES AND LOOKING FOR

04:19:21.112 --> 04:19:22.580
THESE PROJECTS WHETHER IT'S BUS

04:19:22.647 --> 04:19:25.016
FLEETS ARE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS OR

04:19:25.082 --> 04:19:26.584
WORKING WITH RESIDENTS ON ON

04:19:26.651 --> 04:19:27.919
TAKING GROSS POLLUTERS OFF THE

04:19:27.985 --> 04:19:28.753
ROAD.

04:19:28.819 --> 04:19:30.521
REDUCING FUEL COSTS WHAT THE

04:19:30.588 --> 04:19:31.389
SAME TIME YOU KNOW CLEANING UP

04:19:31.455 --> 04:19:32.490
THOSE VEHICLES THERE'S A LOT OF

04:19:32.556 --> 04:19:34.058
GOOD EXAMPLES THAT WE CAN BUILD

04:19:34.125 --> 04:19:35.393
OFF OF IT SO THE QUESTION HERE

04:19:35.459 --> 04:19:36.661
IS WE GET THE SIX SEVENTEEN

04:19:36.727 --> 04:19:38.262
PROCESS HOW DO WE REALLY.

04:19:38.329 --> 04:19:41.532
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT

04:19:41.599 --> 04:19:43.634
COMMUNITY AND THEN TRY TO LEAD

04:19:43.701 --> 04:19:44.735
IDEAS FOR DOING DOING EVEN

04:19:44.802 --> 04:19:46.103
THINGS YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE

04:19:46.170 --> 04:19:47.505
NEW FUNDING THAT'S COMING.

04:19:47.571 --> 04:19:48.272
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IS

04:19:48.339 --> 04:19:48.873
GONNA BE SOME REALLY

04:19:48.940 --> 04:19:50.274
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE WAS

04:19:50.341 --> 04:19:52.176
STATIONARY SOURCES AS WELL WHICH

04:19:52.243 --> 04:19:52.910
ADDITIONALLY Là FUNDING IS

04:19:52.977 --> 04:19:54.145
GOING INTO MOBILE SOURCES.

04:19:54.211 --> 04:19:55.546
THERE REALLY EAGER TO TO

04:19:55.613 --> 04:19:56.547
UNDERSTAND THOSE CONCERNS AND

04:19:56.614 --> 04:19:58.149
SEE WHAT WE COULD DO WITH A

04:19:58.215 --> 04:19:59.717
COMMITTEE INPUT --

04:19:59.784 --> 04:20:01.152
SOME OF THAT NEW FUNDING THAT

04:20:01.218 --> 04:20:02.853
HAS COME THESE LAST A BUDGET

04:20:02.920 --> 04:20:04.322
CYCLES AND THE EARLY WERE CALLED

04:20:04.388 --> 04:20:05.823
EARLY REDUCTION OR THE ACTION

04:20:05.890 --> 04:20:07.158
FUNDS.

04:20:07.224 --> 04:20:08.025
HAVE BEEN PUT TO GOOD USE AND IS

04:20:08.092 --> 04:20:09.560
VALLEY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

04:20:09.627 --> 04:20:11.429
IN OVER 50% OF THEIR INITIAL

04:20:11.495 --> 04:20:11.963
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IS

04:20:12.029 --> 04:20:12.897
ALREADY.

04:20:12.964 --> 04:20:14.999
OBLIGATED TO PROJECTS AND A 100%

04:20:15.066 --> 04:20:16.334
OF THOSE PROJECTS ACTUALLY AND

04:20:16.400 --> 04:20:17.468
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

04:20:17.535 --> 04:20:19.070
THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY A LOT OF

04:20:19.136 --> 04:20:20.071
THEM IN THESE VERY COMMUNITIES

04:20:20.137 --> 04:20:21.105
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY

04:20:21.172 --> 04:20:22.473
SO THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF

04:20:22.540 --> 04:20:23.841
EFFORT IN IN BRINGING ABOUT

04:20:23.908 --> 04:20:25.276
THESE REDUCTIONS THAT WERE

04:20:25.343 --> 04:20:26.177
LOOKING FOR MORE INPUT AS TO HOW.

04:20:26.243 --> 04:20:27.511
WE WOULD GO ABOUT AND WHEN

04:20:27.578 --> 04:20:31.148
WISELY SPEND THAT MONEY IN THE

04:20:31.215 --> 04:20:32.516
IN THESE COMMUNITIES.

04:20:32.583 --> 04:20:33.017
SOME ISN'T IT --

04:20:33.084 --> 04:20:33.951
WRAP IT UP HERE WITH SOME

04:20:34.018 --> 04:20:34.885
CLOSING THOUGHTS IN SOME OF THE

04:20:34.952 --> 04:20:35.553
THINGS YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THEM

04:20:35.619 --> 04:20:36.187
ARE ARE KIND OF UNIQUE TO WHAT

04:20:36.253 --> 04:20:37.288
WE'RE DEALING WITH THE IN THE

04:20:37.355 --> 04:20:39.023
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY --

04:20:39.090 --> 04:20:40.725
YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL --

04:20:40.791 --> 04:20:42.126
PROVIDING ASSISTANCE --

04:20:42.193 --> 04:20:44.095
TAKES A LOT OF RESOURCES TO

04:20:44.161 --> 04:20:46.097
SUPPORT YOU KNOW A LOT OF

04:20:46.163 --> 04:20:46.697
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT ARE

04:20:46.764 --> 04:20:47.598
COMING UP.

04:20:47.665 --> 04:20:49.200
NOW I I DO AGREE WITH A LOT OF

04:20:49.266 --> 04:20:50.735
THE COMMENTS THAT WERE RAISED

04:20:50.801 --> 04:20:51.402
EARLIER THAT THERE IS A LOT THAT

04:20:51.469 --> 04:20:52.370
WE KNOW.

04:20:52.436 --> 04:20:53.671
AND WE'RE BRINGING THOSE

04:20:53.738 --> 04:20:56.307
RESOURCES TO BEAR WE OUR EXPERTS

04:20:56.374 --> 04:20:57.608
ARE OTHER EXPERTS YOU KNOW FROM

04:20:57.675 --> 04:20:59.176
OTHER AGENCIES DEPENDING ON THE

04:20:59.243 --> 04:21:00.544
QUESTIONS INTO THE PROCESS.

04:21:00.611 --> 04:21:01.512
THERE A LOT AND YOU QUESTIONS

04:21:01.579 --> 04:21:02.813
ARE ALSO BEING RAISED THAT ARE

04:21:02.880 --> 04:21:03.981
THAT ARE THAT ARE GENERATING

04:21:04.048 --> 04:21:04.949
WHAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE

04:21:05.016 --> 04:21:06.684
SOME VERY FRUITFUL PROJECTS THAT

04:21:06.751 --> 04:21:09.687
WE WE TRY TO PRIORITIZE AND

04:21:09.754 --> 04:21:10.254
EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN PROCESS

04:21:10.321 --> 04:21:10.888
WHETHER IT'S ON THE MONITORING

04:21:10.955 --> 04:21:11.088
SIDE.

04:21:11.155 --> 04:21:12.656
OR JUST GOING IN INVESTIGATING

04:21:12.723 --> 04:21:14.492
THROUGH OTHER EXERCISES WHAT'S

04:21:14.558 --> 04:21:16.727
HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY TO

04:21:16.794 --> 04:21:17.361
TRY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT

04:21:17.428 --> 04:21:18.162
ARE COMING UP --

04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:19.196
I THINK THAT --

04:21:19.263 --> 04:21:21.399
WORKING WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS --

04:21:21.465 --> 04:21:23.234
MORE MOST EFFECTIVELY MORE

04:21:23.300 --> 04:21:24.802
EFFECTIVELY IT IS REALLY KEY. TO

04:21:24.869 --> 04:21:26.003
THIS PROCESS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:27.405
THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN.

04:21:27.471 --> 04:21:28.572
CONTINUALLY IMPROVING --

04:21:28.639 --> 04:21:30.141
WITH A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN IS THAT

04:21:30.207 --> 04:21:31.675
THERE REALLY IS A DIFFERENT.

04:21:31.742 --> 04:21:33.144
APPROACH WITH A. B. SIX

04:21:33.210 --> 04:21:34.245
SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW WE WE IN IN

04:21:34.311 --> 04:21:35.579
THIS PROCESS YOU DON'T GO

04:21:35.646 --> 04:21:37.081
THROUGH WHAT MIGHT BE A TYPICAL

04:21:37.148 --> 04:21:38.282
IN A REGULATORY RULEMAKING

04:21:38.349 --> 04:21:40.217
PROCESS RESCHEDULE WORKSHOP GIVE

04:21:40.284 --> 04:21:41.385
A PRESENTATION.

04:21:41.452 --> 04:21:42.887
YOU KNOW HAVE A FORMAL PUBLIC

04:21:42.953 --> 04:21:44.422
COMMENTING PROCESS AT THE END.

04:21:44.488 --> 04:21:46.957
THESE ARE A LOT MORE --

04:21:47.024 --> 04:21:48.659
INTERACTIVE MEETINGS UNDER A LOT

04:21:48.726 --> 04:21:50.428
MORE DYNAMIC AND WE REALLY NEED

04:21:50.494 --> 04:21:52.196
TO HAVE IT BE DRIVEN BY THE

04:21:52.263 --> 04:21:53.831
COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW

04:21:53.898 --> 04:21:55.332
IT SETTING THE AGENDA.

04:21:55.399 --> 04:21:58.169
ARTICULATED HAVING THESE

04:21:58.235 --> 04:21:59.837
MEETINGS OF THE COMMUNITY LET

04:21:59.904 --> 04:22:01.072
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS A

04:22:01.138 --> 04:22:02.807
PARADIGM SHIFT I THINK IN IN THE

04:22:02.873 --> 04:22:05.176
WAY THAT SB SIX SEVENTEEN WORK

04:22:05.242 --> 04:22:06.510
SINCE A WORK CONTINUALLY TRYING.

04:22:06.577 --> 04:22:08.012
TO IMPROVE THAT PROCESS I THINK

04:22:08.079 --> 04:22:08.979
EVERY MEETING.

04:22:09.046 --> 04:22:10.848
IN SOME WAY HAS HAS ALLOWED FOR

04:22:10.915 --> 04:22:11.982
FOR EVEN BETTER INTERACTION I

04:22:12.049 --> 04:22:13.250
THINK WE YOU KNOW WE SEE THOSE

04:22:13.317 --> 04:22:14.518
IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME.

04:22:14.585 --> 04:22:16.287
REALLY PAYING OFF YOU KNOW AND

04:22:16.353 --> 04:22:16.887
BY THE WAY.

04:22:16.954 --> 04:22:17.721
WOULD NOTHING THAT I'M SAYING

04:22:17.788 --> 04:22:19.657
HERE IS TO IS TO MINIMIZE THE

04:22:19.723 --> 04:22:20.357
FACT THAT THERE ARE GROWING

04:22:20.424 --> 04:22:21.292
PAINS.

04:22:21.358 --> 04:22:22.560
IN THIS PROCESS WE'VE LEARNED A

04:22:22.626 --> 04:22:23.794
LOT YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THE

04:22:23.861 --> 04:22:25.029
COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES.

04:22:25.096 --> 04:22:26.230
THAT IN FACT I THINK THE THE

04:22:26.297 --> 04:22:27.898
FRESNO STEERING COMMITTEE MAY BE

04:22:27.965 --> 04:22:28.966
THE LARGEST ONE IN THE STATE.

04:22:29.033 --> 04:22:30.634
JUST TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES IN

04:22:30.701 --> 04:22:31.836
TALKING TO TO AIR BE.

04:22:31.902 --> 04:22:33.270
IT'S ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE YOU KNOW

04:22:33.337 --> 04:22:35.139
THAT ARE THE ALL HAVE YOU KNOW

04:22:35.206 --> 04:22:36.974
UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES THAT.

04:22:37.041 --> 04:22:38.175
ALL REALLY WANTED WANT WANT

04:22:38.242 --> 04:22:39.677
THEIR VOICE TO BE HEARD SO IT

04:22:39.743 --> 04:22:41.445
REALLY IS A BIG LEARNING PROCESS

04:22:41.512 --> 04:22:42.947
FOR US AND SO NOTHING THAT I

04:22:43.013 --> 04:22:43.848
THAT I FIGURES REALLY MEANT TO

04:22:43.914 --> 04:22:44.348
MINIMIZE.

04:22:44.415 --> 04:22:46.050
JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US

04:22:46.117 --> 04:22:47.284
TO KIND OF GET THROUGH.

04:22:47.351 --> 04:22:48.686
THOSE GROWING PAINS AND REALLY

04:22:48.752 --> 04:22:49.787
END UP SOMEWHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY

04:22:49.854 --> 04:22:51.555
WORK TOGETHER TO PUT THESE PLANS

04:22:51.622 --> 04:22:52.990
TOGETHER AND BRING ABOUT THOSE

04:22:53.057 --> 04:22:54.058
REDUCTIONS.

04:22:54.125 --> 04:22:54.825
NOW ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED

04:22:54.892 --> 04:22:56.260
QUICKLY IS THAT A LOT OF THE

04:22:56.327 --> 04:22:57.361
CONCERNS THAT ARE COMING UP.

04:22:57.428 --> 04:23:00.331
ARE THINGS THAT DON'T

04:23:00.397 --> 04:23:02.500
NECESSARILY EVEN FALL UNDER

04:23:02.566 --> 04:23:05.069
OTHER WE HOPE TO BE VERY BOLD IN

04:23:05.136 --> 04:23:06.203
A VERY EFFECTIVE EMISSION

04:23:06.270 --> 04:23:07.571
REDUCTION PROGRAMS.

04:23:07.638 --> 04:23:09.106
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT

04:23:09.173 --> 04:23:10.141
ARE COMING UP WHETHER IT SAID

04:23:10.207 --> 04:23:11.542
YOU KNOW STATE PESTICIDE.

04:23:11.609 --> 04:23:13.511
AUTHORITY ISSUE OR MOBILE SOURCE

04:23:13.577 --> 04:23:14.545
ISSUES --

04:23:14.612 --> 04:23:15.779
YOU KNOW WE DO IN OUR IN OUR

04:23:15.846 --> 04:23:17.948
REGION HAVE AN INTER INDIRECT

04:23:18.015 --> 04:23:19.450
SOURCE REVIEW PROGRAM.

04:23:19.517 --> 04:23:21.218
THAT I THINK IS PART OF A OF A

04:23:21.285 --> 04:23:22.286
LARGER.

04:23:22.353 --> 04:23:23.587
SET OF ISSUES THAT DEAL WITH

04:23:23.654 --> 04:23:24.688
MOBILE SOURCES THAT WE'RE TRYING

04:23:24.755 --> 04:23:26.290
TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW WE

04:23:26.357 --> 04:23:27.358
ACTUALLY GO ABOUT IN ADDRESSING

04:23:27.424 --> 04:23:28.959
THOSE IN A PLAN THAT WE

04:23:29.026 --> 04:23:30.761
ULTIMATELY ADOPT AND THEN --

04:23:30.828 --> 04:23:31.996
WORK WITH CARB YOU SEE TO TAKE

04:23:32.062 --> 04:23:33.631
TO THEIR PROCESS SO THERE YOU

04:23:33.697 --> 04:23:34.398
KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS

04:23:34.465 --> 04:23:35.566
THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THAT OUR

04:23:35.633 --> 04:23:36.200
STAFF HAVE BEEN DOING IS TRYING

04:23:36.267 --> 04:23:37.234
TO MAKE SURE.

04:23:37.301 --> 04:23:38.402
THAT WE BRING THE CITIES THE

04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:39.904
COUNTIES INTO THE PROCESS THAT

04:23:39.970 --> 04:23:41.372
WE BRING THE P. R..

04:23:41.438 --> 04:23:42.540
OTHER AGENCIES INTO THE PROCESS

04:23:42.606 --> 04:23:43.507
SO THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY AT THE

04:23:43.574 --> 04:23:46.610
TABLE THEY'RE HEARING THE

04:23:46.677 --> 04:23:47.244
CONCERNS IN THEIR THINKING ABOUT

04:23:47.311 --> 04:23:47.711
WAYS.

04:23:47.778 --> 04:23:48.345
OF CONTRIBUTING TO OUR TO OUR

04:23:48.412 --> 04:23:49.547
OLD ULTIMATELY TO THE PROGRAMS

04:23:49.613 --> 04:23:51.715
THAT WE PUT TOGETHER IN A WAY

04:23:51.782 --> 04:23:52.316
THAT RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS

04:23:52.383 --> 04:23:53.284
THAT ARE COMING UP.

04:23:53.350 --> 04:23:53.884
YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S

04:23:53.951 --> 04:23:54.518
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY HEAR

04:23:54.585 --> 04:23:56.086
THOSE DIRECTLY SO THEY CAN

04:23:56.153 --> 04:23:57.521
ACTUALLY RESPOND TO THEM.

04:23:57.588 --> 04:23:59.590
AND I'M GONNA A C. WRAP UP HERE

04:23:59.657 --> 04:24:02.660
WITH A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS HERE --

04:24:02.726 --> 04:24:04.328
I THINK --

04:24:04.395 --> 04:24:04.929
TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATION BEING

04:24:04.995 --> 04:24:06.297
IMPORTANT.

04:24:06.363 --> 04:24:07.131
JAMIE MENTIONED FACILITATED

04:24:07.198 --> 04:24:08.399
MEETINGS TO ME WE LEARNED VERY

04:24:08.465 --> 04:24:09.867
EARLY ON THAT WE NEED TO HAVE.

04:24:09.934 --> 04:24:11.368
GOOD FACILITATION WE THINK THAT

04:24:11.435 --> 04:24:13.971
THAT CONNECTS THESE FOR MAKING

04:24:14.038 --> 04:24:14.738
THE PROCESS BETTER SO WE'RE

04:24:14.805 --> 04:24:17.608
WORKING ON A SOLUTIONS FOR THAT.

04:24:17.675 --> 04:24:19.009
I THINK WE NEED TO STAINED.

04:24:19.076 --> 04:24:20.744
RESOURCES IN THE PROGRAM I THINK

04:24:20.811 --> 04:24:22.213
IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD YOU KNOW

04:24:22.279 --> 04:24:23.414
YOU TALK WITH YOU HEARD A LOT

04:24:23.480 --> 04:24:24.982
ABOUT MONITORING FOR EXAMPLE.

04:24:25.049 --> 04:24:26.584
AND THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IN IN

04:24:26.650 --> 04:24:27.117
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FRESNO

04:24:27.184 --> 04:24:28.018
COMMUNITY.

04:24:28.085 --> 04:24:29.086
THERE ARE ACTUALLY SEVERAL

04:24:29.153 --> 04:24:30.487
DISTINCT COMMUNITIES WITHIN OUR

04:24:30.554 --> 04:24:31.755
FRESNO COMMUNITY OF CAL --

04:24:31.822 --> 04:24:33.357
YET MALAGA YOU HAVE THE

04:24:33.424 --> 04:24:34.692
INDUSTRIAL TRIANGLE WITH

04:24:34.758 --> 04:24:35.526
DALEVILLE.

04:24:35.593 --> 04:24:37.761
POTENTIALLY SOUTHWEST FRESNO --

04:24:37.828 --> 04:24:39.296
THERE'S ACTUALLY THIS THE ALL

04:24:39.363 --> 04:24:40.965
THE COMMUNITIES NORTH OF CAL --

04:24:41.031 --> 04:24:42.967
EVERYONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES

04:24:43.033 --> 04:24:44.835
THE SORT OF WITHIN THIS LARGER

04:24:44.902 --> 04:24:46.303
COMMUNITY AS PART OF THE PROCESS.

04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:47.705
NEED SOME KIND OF EXTENSIVE

04:24:47.771 --> 04:24:49.840
MONITORING AND SO AS WE INVEST

04:24:49.907 --> 04:24:51.008
IN DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR

04:24:51.075 --> 04:24:53.611
TOXICS FOR FOR FEDERAL REFERENCE

BUT NOT MAKE MY LEFT HERE AT LOW

04:25:03.087 --> 04:25:04.255
COST SENSORS AND THAT TAKES A

04:25:04.321 --> 04:25:05.723
LOT OF RESOURCES SO.

04:25:05.789 --> 04:25:08.158
YOU KNOW WE'RE LEARNING A LOT

INCOMPLETE WITHOUT RECOGNITION

04:25:16.867 --> 04:25:18.102
OF THEIR SUPPORT.

04:25:18.168 --> 04:25:19.403

IS PROVIDED FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.

04:26:20.564 --> 04:26:21.131
I WERE JUST BEGINNING TO REALIZE

04:26:21.198 --> 04:26:22.499
THAT.

04:26:22.566 --> 04:26:24.268
SO -- AND I

MORE AND MY COLLEAGUE SAYS ARE

04:26:32.409 --> 04:26:33.243

04:26:37.514 --> 04:26:40.250
THE PRESENTATION --

04:26:40.317 --> 04:26:41.785
A SORT OF AN OVERVIEW AS FAR AS

04:26:41.852 --> 04:26:43.787
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE COMMUNITIES

04:26:43.854 --> 04:26:44.521
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

04:26:44.588 --> 04:26:45.389
HAPPENING HERE.

04:26:45.456 --> 04:26:46.824
YOU KNOW VERY CLEARLY THAT THIS

04:26:46.890 --> 04:26:48.125
IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A LOT

04:26:48.192 --> 04:26:49.093
OF VISION.

04:26:49.159 --> 04:26:50.794
IT DIDN'T TAKE THEM EVEN ONE

04:26:50.861 --> 04:26:52.196
MEETING TO REALIZE THAT THE

04:26:52.262 --> 04:26:53.764
EXISTING BOUNDARIES WERE NOT

04:26:53.831 --> 04:26:55.132
ADEQUATE --

04:26:55.199 --> 04:26:56.633
TO ENCOMPASS ALL OF THE

04:26:56.700 --> 04:26:58.235
POLLUTION THREATS THAT THEY HAD

04:26:58.302 --> 04:27:00.037
SEEN THROUGH THE COURSE OF THEIR

04:27:00.104 --> 04:27:00.704
LIVES.

04:27:00.771 --> 04:27:02.706
AND AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE

04:27:02.773 --> 04:27:04.174
INVENTORIES PRESENTED BY THE AIR

04:27:04.241 --> 04:27:05.242
DISTRICT.

04:27:05.309 --> 04:27:06.377
THEY WERE VERY CONFIDENT THAT

04:27:06.443 --> 04:27:07.911
THESE RICH INVENTORY DID NOT

04:27:07.978 --> 04:27:10.147
REFLECT THEIR EXPERIENCES.

04:27:10.214 --> 04:27:11.448
ANOTHER WORDS COULDN'T SURVIVE

04:27:11.515 --> 04:27:14.585
GROUND TO WE CONTINUE TO MOVE

04:27:14.651 --> 04:27:16.220
THAT BALL FORWARD.

04:27:16.286 --> 04:27:19.490
AND IN THE FRESNO AREA YOU FIND

04:27:19.556 --> 04:27:21.125
ABOUT -- TWO

04:27:21.191 --> 04:27:22.626
THIRDS OF THAT AREA IS IN THE

04:27:22.693 --> 04:27:24.828
TOP 1% OF CALAMARI SCREENS MOST

04:27:24.895 --> 04:27:26.397
IMPACTED COMMUNITIES SO THESE

04:27:26.463 --> 04:27:27.898
ARE SERIOUSLY UNDERSERVED

04:27:27.965 --> 04:27:29.299
COMMUNITIES.

04:27:29.366 --> 04:27:30.401
SERIOUSLY --

04:27:30.467 --> 04:27:32.069
DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES WHO

04:27:32.136 --> 04:27:34.238
EXPERIENCED YEARS AND YEARS AND

04:27:34.304 --> 04:27:36.407
YEARS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM

04:27:36.473 --> 04:27:36.707
[inaudible]

04:27:36.774 --> 04:27:38.575
SO -- THIS

04:27:38.642 --> 04:27:40.277
IS NOT GOING TO END SOON AND

04:27:40.344 --> 04:27:41.745
WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIX THIS IN

04:27:41.812 --> 04:27:43.914
IN ONE YEAR HERE BUT WE'RE GOING

04:27:43.981 --> 04:27:44.415
TO MAKE A GOOD.

04:27:44.481 --> 04:27:46.316
RUN AT IT AND WE'RE GONNA REALLY

04:27:46.383 --> 04:27:48.352
USES PROCESS TO ADDRESS THE

04:27:48.419 --> 04:27:49.219
SOURCES.

04:27:49.286 --> 04:27:51.155
AND BEGIN TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE

04:27:51.221 --> 04:27:52.790
PROBLEMS AS THEY RELATE TO AIR

04:27:52.856 --> 04:27:54.691
POLLUTION WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT

04:27:54.758 --> 04:27:56.427
THE ENTIRE SOLUTION DOES NOT

04:27:56.493 --> 04:27:58.262
COME FROM AIR POLLUTION AND AIR

04:27:58.328 --> 04:27:58.896
TOXICS.

04:27:58.962 --> 04:28:00.164
BUT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT

04:28:00.230 --> 04:28:01.565
CONTRIBUTOR --

04:28:01.632 --> 04:28:03.267
IN THIS CHAPTER AREA THEY CAME

04:28:03.333 --> 04:28:05.536
TO THAT SAME CONSENSUS EARLY ON

04:28:05.602 --> 04:28:07.337
AND IN THAT AREA AS WELL AND

04:28:07.404 --> 04:28:08.605
WITH THE AIR DISTRICTS --

04:28:08.672 --> 04:28:11.442
ALMOST IMMEDIATE --

04:28:11.508 --> 04:28:12.843
AGREEMENT EXPANDED THEIR

04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:15.179
BOUNDARY LEVEL FROM THE EXISTING

04:28:15.245 --> 04:28:17.881
SQUARE TO A ROUGHLY SEVEN MILE

04:28:17.948 --> 04:28:19.950
DIAMETER CIRCLE THAT REALLY DOES

04:28:20.017 --> 04:28:20.884
BRING IN.

04:28:20.951 --> 04:28:22.853
ALL THE SOURCES THAT THEY'RE

04:28:22.920 --> 04:28:25.055
CONCERNED ABOUT --

04:28:25.122 --> 04:28:26.824
BOTH SHAFTER AND FRESNO HAVE

04:28:26.890 --> 04:28:28.358
DEMANDED THE INCLUSION OF

04:28:28.425 --> 04:28:29.493
PESTICIDES.

04:28:29.560 --> 04:28:31.028
AND DOWNING SHAFTER THEY

04:28:31.094 --> 04:28:32.763
ADDITIONALLY ARE DEALING WITH A

04:28:32.830 --> 04:28:34.865
LARGE NUMBER OF CONCENTRATED

04:28:34.932 --> 04:28:36.633
ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS.

04:28:36.700 --> 04:28:38.202
MAINLY DAIRIES AND WHEN I SAY

04:28:38.268 --> 04:28:39.903
CONCENTRATED ANIMAL I'M TALKING

04:28:39.970 --> 04:28:42.172
ABOUT FIVE TO TWENTY THOUSAND

04:28:42.239 --> 04:28:42.873
ANIMALS.

04:28:42.940 --> 04:28:44.174
PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF JOKES ABOUT

04:28:44.241 --> 04:28:47.044
CAL FARTS YOU KNOW AND CAL BURBS.

04:28:47.110 --> 04:28:47.711
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY FUNNY

04:28:47.778 --> 04:28:50.180
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT TWENTY

04:28:50.247 --> 04:28:50.781
THOUSAND I'M SITTING NEXT YEAR

04:28:50.848 --> 04:28:51.014
HOUSE.

04:28:51.081 --> 04:28:53.550
IT'S NOT NEARLY AS HUMOR'S AT

04:28:53.617 --> 04:28:54.451
THAT POINT.

04:28:54.518 --> 04:28:55.586
SO THE INDUSTRY DONE A GOOD JOB

04:28:55.652 --> 04:28:57.087
WITH THAT BUT YOU KNOW IT IT IT

04:28:57.154 --> 04:28:59.389
IS WHAT IT IS SO --

04:28:59.456 --> 04:29:01.758
WE HAD FOUR MEETINGS NOW FIVE TO

04:29:01.825 --> 04:29:03.760
DATE -- IN

04:29:03.827 --> 04:29:04.828
THE BEGINNING MEETING WAS AN

04:29:04.895 --> 04:29:06.196
OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS I JUST

04:29:06.263 --> 04:29:07.598
WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT.

04:29:07.664 --> 04:29:08.632
THERE'S THIS TENDENCY OF THE

04:29:08.699 --> 04:29:10.200
DISTRICT TO RUN OUT HOW MUCH

04:29:10.267 --> 04:29:11.335
MONEY THEY'VE SPENT OVER A

04:29:11.401 --> 04:29:13.303
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. TWENTY

04:29:13.370 --> 04:29:14.371
YEARS THIRTY YEARS FORTY YEARS

04:29:14.438 --> 04:29:16.006
OF BILLION DOLLARS WHATEVER IT

04:29:16.073 --> 04:29:18.275
IS RIDICULOUS NUMBERS THAT MAKE

04:29:18.342 --> 04:29:19.510
NO SENSE.

04:29:19.576 --> 04:29:20.777
BECAUSE IF THEY DID MAKE SENSE

04:29:20.844 --> 04:29:21.945
WE HAVE CLEAN AIR.

04:29:22.012 --> 04:29:23.213
HOW CAN YOU SPEND THAT MUCH

04:29:23.280 --> 04:29:24.615
MONEY IN A PLACE TO CLEAN THE

04:29:24.681 --> 04:29:26.383
AIR NOT GET CLEAN AIR?

04:29:26.450 --> 04:29:28.051
THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME AT ALL.

04:29:28.118 --> 04:29:29.620
SO YOU HAVE TO REALLY WONDER IF

04:29:29.686 --> 04:29:31.388
WE'VE INVESTED HUNDREDS OF

04:29:31.455 --> 04:29:33.156
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALREADY INTO

04:29:33.223 --> 04:29:34.558
THE INDUSTRIES IN THE SAN

04:29:34.625 --> 04:29:35.259
JOAQUIN VALLEY TO HELP THEM

04:29:35.325 --> 04:29:36.260
CLEAN UP.

04:29:36.326 --> 04:29:37.928
WHY HASN'T IT HAPPENED WHY ISN'T

04:29:37.995 --> 04:29:40.297
THAT MEASURED IN ACTUAL CLEAN

04:29:40.364 --> 04:29:41.665
AIR DAYS WE SEEN?

04:29:41.732 --> 04:29:43.734
SOMEONE OF A REDUCTION IN THE

04:29:43.800 --> 04:29:45.435
NUMBER OF DAYS WITH DIRTY AIR --

04:29:45.502 --> 04:29:47.271
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT A LARGE

04:29:47.337 --> 04:29:48.939
AMOUNT OF THAT REDUCTION IS A

04:29:49.006 --> 04:29:51.008
READ IS A RESULT OF MOBILE

04:29:51.074 --> 04:29:52.376
SOURCE REDUCTIONS.

04:29:52.442 --> 04:29:54.144
AUTOMOBILE CLEAN UPS HAVE BEEN

04:29:54.211 --> 04:29:56.280
MASSIVE BY TWO THOUSAND THAT OUR

04:29:56.346 --> 04:29:57.714
MOBILE TECHNOLOGY TO CLEAN THE

04:29:57.781 --> 04:29:58.615
TAIL PIPE.

04:29:58.682 --> 04:30:00.651
HAD GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE

04:30:00.717 --> 04:30:03.220
YOU COULD ALMOST SAY.

04:30:03.287 --> 04:30:04.988
AND TRUCKS AFTER THE TWO

04:30:05.055 --> 04:30:05.923
THOUSAND TEN TRUCK RULE WE

04:30:05.989 --> 04:30:07.524
REALLY DID START TO SEE SOME

04:30:07.591 --> 04:30:08.759
REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS THERE.

04:30:08.825 --> 04:30:10.093
BUT WE STILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS

04:30:10.160 --> 04:30:11.628
AMOUNT OF INDUSTRY IN THE SOUTH

04:30:11.695 --> 04:30:13.063
VALLEY WE'VE GOT A TON OF

04:30:13.130 --> 04:30:14.431
BOILING GAS.

04:30:14.498 --> 04:30:15.933
RESERVES THAT ARE BEING PUMPED

04:30:15.999 --> 04:30:17.701
OUT OF THE GROUND AND STORED IN

04:30:17.768 --> 04:30:19.670
COMMUNITIES NEXT TO HOMES.

04:30:19.736 --> 04:30:20.737
AND UP IN THE NORTH VALLEY WE'VE

04:30:20.804 --> 04:30:23.106
GOT BUSINESSES WHERE JUST LIKE

04:30:23.173 --> 04:30:23.874
IN SOME OF THE CITIES IN

04:30:23.941 --> 04:30:25.709
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'RE SEEING

04:30:25.776 --> 04:30:27.544
REALLY --

04:30:27.611 --> 04:30:28.745
YOU KNOW.

04:30:28.812 --> 04:30:30.514
POLLUTION.

04:30:30.581 --> 04:30:32.015
RATING BUSINESSES BEING PLACED

04:30:32.082 --> 04:30:34.351
RIGHT NEXT TO HOMES BUT MAINLY

04:30:34.418 --> 04:30:35.986
IN THE SOUTH PART FRESNO.

04:30:36.053 --> 04:30:37.721
IN THIS CONTINUES [inaudible]

04:30:37.788 --> 04:30:39.890
SO -- EARLY

04:30:39.957 --> 04:30:42.025
ON THE E. J. GROUPS REACH OUT TO

04:30:42.092 --> 04:30:43.961
THE DISTRICT I WILL SAY NOW I

04:30:44.027 --> 04:30:44.595
WANT TO SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE

04:30:44.661 --> 04:30:45.295
HERE.

04:30:45.362 --> 04:30:46.797
WE CAN REACH OUT TO THE DISTRICT

04:30:46.863 --> 04:30:47.998
EARLY ON AND THEY AGREED TO MEET

04:30:48.065 --> 04:30:49.866
WITH US AND PLAN THE FIRST

04:30:49.933 --> 04:30:50.767
MEETINGS.

04:30:50.834 --> 04:30:52.102
AND IN SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS WE

04:30:52.169 --> 04:30:53.837
ADDED RESIDENTS TO THAT MEETING

04:30:53.904 --> 04:30:55.572
GROUP AND WE CONTINUE TO MEET

04:30:55.639 --> 04:30:56.707
WITH THE DISTRICT.

04:30:56.773 --> 04:30:58.175
PRIOR TO MEETINGS AND AFTER

04:30:58.241 --> 04:31:00.510
MEETINGS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND

04:31:00.577 --> 04:31:01.778
THERE HAVE BEEN.

04:31:01.845 --> 04:31:03.680
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

04:31:03.747 --> 04:31:05.649
OVERALL MEETING STRUCTURE AND

04:31:05.716 --> 04:31:07.351
HOW IT ROLLS OUT.

04:31:07.417 --> 04:31:10.187
FROM THAT PROCESS --

04:31:10.253 --> 04:31:11.622
THINGS HAVE SORT OF COME UP IS

04:31:11.688 --> 04:31:13.023
QUITE HONESTLY WHAT WE SEE A

04:31:13.090 --> 04:31:14.825
GENERAL CONCERN THAT ARE

04:31:14.891 --> 04:31:16.460
RESIDENTS OF EXPRESSED ABOUT THE

04:31:16.526 --> 04:31:17.427
CULTURAL COMPETENCY

04:31:17.494 --> 04:31:18.495
INSENSITIVITY.

04:31:18.562 --> 04:31:21.198
OF THE FACILITATOR AND SOME OF

04:31:21.264 --> 04:31:23.000
THE AIR DISTRICT STAFF --

04:31:23.066 --> 04:31:24.368
WE GET THAT THEY MEAN WELL IN

04:31:24.434 --> 04:31:25.902
THAT NOBODY IS INTENTIONALLY

04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:27.270
INSULTING PEOPLE BUT

04:31:27.337 --> 04:31:29.539
UNINTENTIONALLY A LOT OF INSULTS

04:31:29.606 --> 04:31:31.675
OF HAPPEN PEOPLE OF FELT.

04:31:31.742 --> 04:31:34.311
IN THE DEGRADED HAVE FELT --

04:31:34.378 --> 04:31:36.279
LIKE SOMEBODY IS IS TALKING DOWN

04:31:36.346 --> 04:31:38.348
TO THEM AND AND TALKING FROM A

04:31:38.415 --> 04:31:40.317
WHITE TOWER SAYING YOU KNOW THE

04:31:40.384 --> 04:31:41.852
IVORY TOWER COMPLEX AND AND WE

04:31:41.918 --> 04:31:43.286
KNOW THAT'S NOT INTENDED THOSE

04:31:43.353 --> 04:31:44.621
OF US WHO WORK WITH THE DISTRICT

04:31:44.688 --> 04:31:45.822
FOR MANY YEARS AND KNOW THESE

04:31:45.889 --> 04:31:47.090
PEOPLE PERSONALLY.

04:31:47.157 --> 04:31:49.559
BUT IN THIS SITUATION SITUATION

04:31:49.626 --> 04:31:50.961
IT'S JUST NOT WORKING OUT WELL

04:31:51.028 --> 04:31:52.229
SO.

04:31:52.295 --> 04:31:53.530
WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE DISTRICT

04:31:53.597 --> 04:31:56.667
HAS EXCEPT SOME OF OUR E. J.

04:31:56.733 --> 04:31:59.102
GROUPS MIGHT LEADS AND CULTURAL

04:31:59.169 --> 04:32:01.204
SENSITIVITY TRAINING THERE HELP

04:32:01.271 --> 04:32:01.805
THEM BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO

04:32:01.872 --> 04:32:02.773
WORK IN.

04:32:02.839 --> 04:32:03.774
AND COMMUNICATE WITH OUR

04:32:03.840 --> 04:32:05.275
COMMUNITIES AND SO WE'RE HOPING

04:32:05.342 --> 04:32:06.977
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN VERY SOON.

04:32:07.044 --> 04:32:07.944
AND THAT SOMETHING GOOD WILL

04:32:08.011 --> 04:32:09.413
HAPPEN FROM THAT SO I WANT TO

04:32:09.479 --> 04:32:11.281
PUT FRESNO IN PERSPECTIVE THIS

04:32:11.348 --> 04:32:13.750
IS THE CITY OF FRESNO --

04:32:13.817 --> 04:32:15.252
YOU CAN SEE --

04:32:15.318 --> 04:32:17.921
FROM THE LEGEND HERE THAT THE

04:32:17.988 --> 04:32:19.823
MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITIES IN

04:32:19.890 --> 04:32:21.625
THE AREA THAT THE COMMUNITY

04:32:21.692 --> 04:32:24.695
WANTS TO SEE PART OF THIS ARE IN

04:32:24.761 --> 04:32:26.229
THE NINETY NINTH PERCENTILE.

04:32:26.296 --> 04:32:27.097
THESE COMMUNITIES ARE

04:32:27.164 --> 04:32:30.167
CONCENTRATED IN THIS AREA IT IS

04:32:30.233 --> 04:32:31.802
ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTED IF NOT

04:32:31.868 --> 04:32:33.070
THE MOST IMPACTED SAID OF

04:32:33.136 --> 04:32:34.271
COMMUNITIES.

04:32:34.337 --> 04:32:35.706
THAT ARE ADJACENT TO EACH OTHER

04:32:35.772 --> 04:32:36.707
IN THIS IN THE STATE OF

04:32:36.773 --> 04:32:37.708
CALIFORNIA.

04:32:37.774 --> 04:32:38.875
SO -- THE

04:32:38.942 --> 04:32:41.078
OTHER COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING IT --

04:32:41.144 --> 04:32:42.779
IN THE 97%.

04:32:42.846 --> 04:32:43.580
TO SO --

04:32:43.647 --> 04:32:45.048
DRILLING DOWN INTO THE AREA OF

04:32:45.115 --> 04:32:46.917
INTEREST FRESNO BY THE WAY AS A

04:32:46.983 --> 04:32:47.918
METROPOLIS AREA WITH A

04:32:47.984 --> 04:32:49.553
POPULATION OF ABOUT ONE POINT

04:32:49.619 --> 04:32:51.154
ONE MILLION PEOPLE I ALWAYS

04:32:51.221 --> 04:32:52.723
WONDER IF THE REST OF CALIFORNIA

04:32:52.789 --> 04:32:54.191
UNDERSTANDS THAT.

04:32:54.257 --> 04:32:55.392
IT'S NOT SOME LITTLE BURKE

04:32:55.459 --> 04:32:56.760
SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUNCH

04:32:56.827 --> 04:32:57.294
OF COUNTLESS.

04:32:57.360 --> 04:32:59.563
K. THERE'S A MILLION PEOPLE

04:32:59.629 --> 04:33:00.964
LIVING HERE ALL RIGHT.

04:33:01.031 --> 04:33:01.732
AND SO THEY HAVE ALL THE

04:33:01.798 --> 04:33:03.600
PROBLEMS THAT A MILLION PEOPLE

04:33:03.667 --> 04:33:05.869
HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE YOU KNOW IT'S

04:33:05.936 --> 04:33:07.971
IT'S THE ONLY INLAND CITY IN

04:33:08.038 --> 04:33:10.107
CALIFORNIA WITH OUT DIRECT

04:33:10.173 --> 04:33:11.608
ACCESS TO THE OCEAN.

04:33:11.675 --> 04:33:15.512
EVEN SACRAMENTO HAS A RIVER UP

04:33:15.579 --> 04:33:17.080
AND DOWN TO THE BAY.

04:33:17.147 --> 04:33:18.582
FRESNO IS THE ONLY CITY OF IT'S

04:33:18.648 --> 04:33:21.218
SIZE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THAT.

04:33:21.284 --> 04:33:23.153
SO THAT MEANS WHAT.

04:33:23.220 --> 04:33:24.688
TRUCKS RIGHT.

04:33:24.755 --> 04:33:26.590
WE PRODUCE A LOT OF STOP.

04:33:26.656 --> 04:33:27.858
SO -- WE NOT

04:33:27.924 --> 04:33:29.426
ONLY PRODUCE A LOT AG PRODUCTS

04:33:29.493 --> 04:33:30.594
BUT WE PRODUCE A LOT OF

04:33:30.660 --> 04:33:32.362
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS WHICH MAY

04:33:32.429 --> 04:33:33.830
NOT BE QUITE SO WELL KNOWN.

04:33:33.897 --> 04:33:35.332
WE HAVE SOME OF THE LARGEST

04:33:35.398 --> 04:33:37.701
GLASS PLANTS IN THE WESTERN

04:33:37.768 --> 04:33:39.569
UNITED STATES.

04:33:39.636 --> 04:33:40.670
RIGHT NEXT TO ONE OF THE

04:33:40.737 --> 04:33:42.305
COMMUNITIES HERE.

04:33:42.372 --> 04:33:44.207
SO THIS IS THE ORIGINAL TRIANGLE

04:33:44.274 --> 04:33:45.709
THAT WAS CHOSEN.

04:33:45.776 --> 04:33:47.377
THE PURPLE AREA REFLECTS WHAT

04:33:47.444 --> 04:33:48.979
THE COMMUNITY WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

04:33:49.045 --> 04:33:50.580
THE BIG GREG AND HERE'S WHY YOU

04:33:50.647 --> 04:33:52.983
SEE THAT BIG RED DOT RIGHT THERE

04:33:53.049 --> 04:33:53.617
AT THE BOTTOM EDGE ON THE RIGHT

04:33:53.683 --> 04:33:54.751
HAND SIDE.

04:33:54.818 --> 04:33:56.419
THAT'S A BIOMASS INCINERATOR

04:33:56.486 --> 04:33:58.555
LITTLE RED DOT BELOW IT IT'S A

04:33:58.622 --> 04:34:00.357
GIANT GLASS FACTORY.

04:34:00.423 --> 04:34:02.325
UP HERE AT THE TOP THAT'S A BIG

04:34:02.392 --> 04:34:04.728
TRUCK CENTER AND ROOFING CENTER

04:34:04.795 --> 04:34:06.429
UP THERE AT THE TOP.

04:34:06.496 --> 04:34:07.397
SO.

04:34:07.464 --> 04:34:08.899
WE WANT TO KNOW.

04:34:08.965 --> 04:34:10.801
WHO WROTE THIS BOUNDARY RIGHT

04:34:10.867 --> 04:34:12.169
THIS ISN'T A BOUNDARY THAT WE

04:34:12.235 --> 04:34:13.470
SUGGESTED IN FACT?

04:34:13.537 --> 04:34:15.005
THERE'S EVEN A CREAMERY RIGHT

04:34:15.071 --> 04:34:16.573
THERE IN THAT LITTLE TRIANGLE AT

04:34:16.640 --> 04:34:18.041
THE TOP THAT LITTLE INDENTATION

04:34:18.108 --> 04:34:19.876
IS LIKE HOW DID THAT GET LEFT

04:34:19.943 --> 04:34:20.043
OUT.

04:34:20.110 --> 04:34:21.812
WHO MADE THAT DECISION?

04:34:21.878 --> 04:34:23.847
WE DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S OKAY

04:34:23.914 --> 04:34:25.081
BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW

04:34:25.148 --> 04:34:26.883
WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE CAN FIX

04:34:26.950 --> 04:34:28.451
THIS AND HERE'S HOW.

04:34:28.518 --> 04:34:29.753
SO BY THE WAY WE WENT THROUGH A

04:34:29.820 --> 04:34:31.655
VERY DELIBERATIVE PROCESS ON

04:34:31.721 --> 04:34:32.489
THIS I KNOW THIS IS KIND OF

04:34:32.556 --> 04:34:34.191
CONFUSING BUT I JUST WANT PEOPLE

04:34:34.257 --> 04:34:35.525
TO UNDERSTAND.

04:34:35.592 --> 04:34:36.960
WITH THESE COMMITTEE MEMBERS

04:34:37.027 --> 04:34:38.728
THESE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN

04:34:38.795 --> 04:34:40.063
LOOKING AT THE SOURCES.

04:34:40.130 --> 04:34:41.398
THOSE STARS ON THEIR THEY

04:34:41.465 --> 04:34:43.533
REPRESENT TOXIC EMISSIONS FROM

04:34:43.600 --> 04:34:45.802
AIR TOXICS SOURCES THE ROUND DOT

04:34:45.869 --> 04:34:46.903
TREATMENTS DO.

04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:48.705
NOT REPRESENT STATIONARY SOURCE

04:34:48.772 --> 04:34:51.141
EMISSIONS SO YOU CAN SEE RIGHT

04:34:51.208 --> 04:34:53.243
AWAY HOW MANY OF THESE EMISSIONS

04:34:53.310 --> 04:34:55.011
LIE NOT JUST ALONG THE HIGHWAY

04:34:55.078 --> 04:34:56.379
BUT OFF THE HIGHWAY IN THESE

04:34:56.446 --> 04:34:57.347
COMMUNITIES.

04:34:57.414 --> 04:34:59.482
ALONG THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE

04:34:59.549 --> 04:35:01.685
RESIDENTS RIGHTLY SO WANT TO SEE

04:35:01.751 --> 04:35:03.854
THESE SOURCES INCLUDED IN ANY

04:35:03.920 --> 04:35:05.188
WORK THAT GETS DONE.

04:35:05.255 --> 04:35:06.857
AND IN FACT EVEN THOUGH IT'S

04:35:06.923 --> 04:35:09.226
QUITE SOME.

04:35:09.292 --> 04:35:10.961
YOU SEE A LITTLE NOTATION OF

04:35:11.027 --> 04:35:12.929
DARLING INDUSTRIES WHICH IS

04:35:12.996 --> 04:35:15.065
BECOME NATIONALLY FAMOUS. FOR

04:35:15.131 --> 04:35:16.533
ITS A RENDERING PLANT.

04:35:16.600 --> 04:35:18.435
AND WRITE DOWN WIND OF IT IS A

04:35:18.501 --> 04:35:20.103
HIGH SCHOOL.

04:35:20.170 --> 04:35:21.872
AND THAT HIGH SCHOOL ON ANY

04:35:21.938 --> 04:35:24.074
GIVEN DAY IT'S GOT ABOUT. FIVE

04:35:24.140 --> 04:35:25.809
THOUSAND KIDS.

04:35:25.876 --> 04:35:27.677
AN AND THEY'LL TELL YOU IN MAY

04:35:27.744 --> 04:35:29.279
YOU CAN HARDLY STAND IT THERE.

04:35:29.346 --> 04:35:30.947
THE SMELL OF THIS PLACE AS

04:35:31.014 --> 04:35:33.416
ROTTING ANIMAL FLESH IS JUST.

04:35:33.483 --> 04:35:35.151
WAITING INTO THE AIR AND COMING

04:35:35.218 --> 04:35:37.354
DOWN ON THEIR SCHOOL WHEN THEY

04:35:37.420 --> 04:35:38.655
COME OUTSIDE FOR A BREAK.

04:35:38.722 --> 04:35:39.856
THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT THIS

04:35:39.923 --> 04:35:42.092
IS RIDICULOUS SO IN THE NEXT TO

04:35:42.158 --> 04:35:44.160
IT IS FOSTER FARMS AND I ALWAYS

04:35:44.227 --> 04:35:45.629
SAY NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING.

04:35:45.695 --> 04:35:46.263
GO OUT TO ANY OF THE

04:35:46.329 --> 04:35:47.564
NEIGHBORHOODS HERE DOWN WHEN TO

04:35:47.631 --> 04:35:48.899
FOSTER FARMS AND ALL YOU CAN

04:35:48.965 --> 04:35:50.567
SMELL FOR FOUR HOURS IS BAKING

04:35:50.634 --> 04:35:51.468
CHECK.

04:35:51.534 --> 04:35:52.802
SO I MEAN YOU KNOW THESE ARE

04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:54.437
SOURCES THAT ARE DIRECT THREAT

04:35:54.504 --> 04:35:55.672
TO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY

04:35:55.739 --> 04:35:57.574
EXPERIENCE EVERY DAY AND HAVE

04:35:57.641 --> 04:35:59.542
BEEN. FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS

04:35:59.609 --> 04:36:01.845
OR MORE AND THEY HAVE COMPLAINED

04:36:01.912 --> 04:36:03.747
AND TRIED TO GET REDRESS FROM

04:36:03.813 --> 04:36:05.482
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FROM

04:36:05.548 --> 04:36:07.083
PLANNING COMMISSIONS.

04:36:07.150 --> 04:36:09.252
AND FOR THE BAD LUCK OF OUR

04:36:09.319 --> 04:36:10.687
AGENCY HERE NOW COMING HERE AND

04:36:10.754 --> 04:36:12.188
SAYING LOOK.

04:36:12.255 --> 04:36:13.390
YOU KNOW WE WANT THIS CHECKED

04:36:13.456 --> 04:36:15.125
OUT WE WANT MONITORS AROUND THE

04:36:15.191 --> 04:36:16.993
SOURCES WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S

04:36:17.060 --> 04:36:17.827
IN THIS AIR.

04:36:17.894 --> 04:36:19.296
AND IF IT'S WHAT WE THINK IT IS

04:36:19.362 --> 04:36:21.264
YOU NEED TO FIX THIS.

04:36:21.331 --> 04:36:21.932
AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM

04:36:21.998 --> 04:36:23.433
UNREASONABLE SO THE COMMUNITY

04:36:23.500 --> 04:36:24.935
HAS PROPOSED ACTUALLY THIS

04:36:25.001 --> 04:36:25.802
BOUNDARY.

04:36:25.869 --> 04:36:27.337
I I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT

04:36:27.404 --> 04:36:28.838
THE MAP THAT THEY'RE USING BUT

04:36:28.905 --> 04:36:30.440
THAT'S COOL I THINK IT'S MORE

04:36:30.507 --> 04:36:31.942
THAT 1% RIGHT THAT YOU'RE

04:36:32.008 --> 04:36:33.643
SHOWING ON YOUR MAP BUT THIS IS

04:36:33.710 --> 04:36:35.045
ACTUALLY WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS

04:36:35.111 --> 04:36:38.148
pALL OF THESE CORNERS OUR GEO

04:36:38.214 --> 04:36:40.617
TAGGED OUR SHOP AT CCAC HAS THE

04:36:40.684 --> 04:36:41.952
TECHNICAL EXPERTS WHO CAN

04:36:42.018 --> 04:36:43.153
PRODUCE THIS DATA.

04:36:43.219 --> 04:36:44.688
AND ALL OF THE SOURCES ARE FROM

04:36:44.754 --> 04:36:47.891
THE AIR THE BASE AND OUR MOST

04:36:47.958 --> 04:36:52.762
CURRENT CELL.

04:36:52.829 --> 04:36:55.165
SO THE LAST THING I DO WANT TO

04:36:55.231 --> 04:36:56.666
MENTION IS YOU HEARD ABOUT OUR

04:36:56.733 --> 04:36:58.268
IN THE INDUSTRIAL TRIANGLE

04:36:58.335 --> 04:36:59.836
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY A PLACE.

04:36:59.903 --> 04:37:01.438
IT'S A PLAN THE CITY OF FRESNO

04:37:01.504 --> 04:37:03.640
MADE TO SITE ALL THIS INDUSTRIAL

04:37:03.707 --> 04:37:05.041
STUFF.

04:37:05.108 --> 04:37:06.343
RIGHT IN THIS SPOT IN SOUTH

04:37:06.409 --> 04:37:07.310

04:37:09.112 --> 04:37:10.313
HUNDRED YEARS.

04:37:10.380 --> 04:37:11.915
LOTS OF PEOPLE LIVING DOWN THERE

04:37:11.982 --> 04:37:13.616
THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A TRIANGLE

04:37:13.683 --> 04:37:15.352
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE INDUSTRIAL

04:37:15.418 --> 04:37:17.420

THIS PROCESS AND THIS HAS BECOME

04:40:02.852 --> 04:40:03.686
THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE PARADIGM

AS FAR AS ON THE COMMUNITY AS

04:40:12.095 --> 04:40:13.163

RIGHT.

04:40:35.385 --> 04:40:37.720
THE PROPOSED BOUNDARY IS WITHIN

04:40:37.787 --> 04:40:39.088
THE GREEN LINE.

04:40:39.155 --> 04:40:41.457
THIS MAP WAS MADE LARGE AND

THE COMMITTEE WAS ASKED TO PLACE

04:40:46.796 --> 04:40:48.064
MARKERS WHERE THE POLLUTION

04:40:48.131 --> 04:40:49.866
SOURCES WERE AND OF COURSE

04:40:49.933 --> 04:40:51.634
WITHIN THE WINDOW OF THE GREEN

04:40:51.701 --> 04:40:52.602
AREA.

04:40:52.669 --> 04:40:54.003
THEY SAID WALL.

OF THE OIL IS DOWN HERE AND THAT

04:40:58.007 --> 04:40:59.542
THERE IS ARE THIS WAY WE CAN PUT

04:40:59.609 --> 04:41:01.244
HIM ON THE MAP.

04:41:01.311 --> 04:41:02.679
WE NEED TO EXTEND THE BOUNDARIES

04:41:02.745 --> 04:41:05.882
AND WHAT CAME OF A CONSENSUS IN

04:41:05.949 --> 04:41:08.084
VOTING PROCESS OF THE COMMITTEE

04:41:08.151 --> 04:41:09.319
WITH THIS EXTENDED SEVEN MILE

04:41:09.385 --> 04:41:11.754
BOUNDARY WHICH AS YOU SEE THE

04:41:11.821 --> 04:41:13.756
GREAT TABS ON THE OUTSIDE

04:41:13.823 --> 04:41:15.225
REPRESENT EMISSIONS THAT WERE

04:41:15.291 --> 04:41:16.626
NOT PREVIOUSLY.

04:41:16.693 --> 04:41:18.661
WITHIN THE EMISSIONS INVENTORY

04:41:18.728 --> 04:41:21.464
IN CHAPTER.

04:41:21.531 --> 04:41:23.233
THIS IS A IS A GALLON VIRAL

04:41:23.299 --> 04:41:25.468
SCREEN MAP THAT SHOWS THE HIGH

04:41:25.535 --> 04:41:27.637
LEVEL OF PESTICIDE USE FALLS

04:41:27.704 --> 04:41:29.205
WITHIN THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE.

04:41:29.272 --> 04:41:32.408
WITHIN THE CITY OF SHAFTER THE

04:41:32.475 --> 04:41:34.110
PROPOSED.

04:41:34.177 --> 04:41:36.779
TONNAGE OF THE PESTICIDE IS

04:41:36.846 --> 04:41:38.481
AROUND TWO THOUSAND IN THE

04:41:38.548 --> 04:41:41.050
CENSUS TRACKS. TO THE WEST AND

04:41:41.117 --> 04:41:44.187
TO THE EAST WHEN SHOWS TWO

04:41:44.254 --> 04:41:44.787
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY

04:41:44.854 --> 04:41:47.023
SIX OTHER ONE THOUSAND NINE

04:41:47.090 --> 04:41:47.657
HUNDRED NINETY THREE POUNDS PER

SQUARE MILE OF PESTICIDES

04:41:48.791 --> 04:41:49.425
APPLIED.

04:41:49.492 --> 04:41:51.561
WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON WHY THE

04:41:51.628 --> 04:41:53.296
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE VERY

04:41:53.363 --> 04:41:54.931
INTERESTED IN EXTENDING THIS

04:41:54.998 --> 04:41:56.866
BOUNDARY.

04:41:56.933 --> 04:41:58.201
THIS IS THE MAP GIVEN TO US BY

04:41:58.268 --> 04:41:59.335
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

04:41:59.402 --> 04:42:01.371
PUBLIC HEALTH THAT SHOWS A

04:42:01.437 --> 04:42:02.505
LEGEND AS WELL --

04:42:02.572 --> 04:42:03.906
THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS NEAR

04:42:03.973 --> 04:42:05.675
CHAPTER AND AS WELL THEY FALL

04:42:05.742 --> 04:42:07.010
OUTSIDE OF THE JURISDICTIONAL

04:42:07.076 --> 04:42:08.845
AREA -- BUT

04:42:08.911 --> 04:42:10.813
WITH THIS INCREASE THE SEVEN

04:42:10.880 --> 04:42:14.217
MILE RADIUS. SEVEN OF THESE TEN

04:42:14.284 --> 04:42:16.319
DAIRIES WILL FALL IN THE NEW

04:42:16.386 --> 04:42:18.454
JURISDICTIONAL INVENTORY AND

04:42:18.521 --> 04:42:19.989
ONLY THREE OF THEM FALL OUTSIDE

04:42:20.056 --> 04:42:21.190
WITH THE FOR THIS ONE BEING ON

04:42:21.257 --> 04:42:22.425
THE EIGHT AND A HALF MILES FROM

04:42:22.492 --> 04:42:24.460
CHAPTER ALL TEN OF THEM BEING

04:42:24.527 --> 04:42:26.329
WITHIN FIVE MILES OF ME BEFORE

04:42:26.396 --> 04:42:26.863
WHICH IS --

04:42:26.929 --> 04:42:28.898
THIS ONE OF THE ELEMENTARY

04:42:28.965 --> 04:42:30.333
SCHOOL THAT HAVE HOLDS THE

04:42:30.400 --> 04:42:32.835
HIGHEST POPULATION OF KIDS IN

04:42:32.902 --> 04:42:36.005
THE DISTRICT.

04:42:36.072 --> 04:42:37.573
SO THIS MAP NOT CORRUPTED BUT

04:42:37.640 --> 04:42:38.608
THIS IS KIND OF MY ROUTINE

04:42:38.675 --> 04:42:40.109
INDICATOR MAP OF JENNER

04:42:40.176 --> 04:42:42.178
GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE I

04:42:42.245 --> 04:42:44.447
WILL GO THIS WAY REAL QUICK.

04:42:44.514 --> 04:42:46.049
SO IF YOU SEE RIGHT HERE THESE

04:42:46.115 --> 04:42:47.583
ARE ALL OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

04:42:47.650 --> 04:42:48.685
AREAS.

04:42:48.751 --> 04:42:50.486
AND THESE ARE HERE AS WELL THAT

04:42:50.553 --> 04:42:51.621
WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE

04:42:51.688 --> 04:42:53.423
ORIGINAL BOUNDARIES BUT BECAUSE

04:42:53.489 --> 04:42:54.290
OF THE EXTENDED SEVEN MILE

04:42:54.357 --> 04:42:57.260
BOUNDARIES NOW THESE HAZARDOUS

04:42:57.327 --> 04:42:59.796
AREAS WILL FALL AND TO THE AREA.

04:42:59.862 --> 04:43:02.432
THIS IS A TOXIC RELEASE FACILITY

04:43:02.498 --> 04:43:04.567
GREEN INDICATOR MAP AS WELL IT

04:43:04.634 --> 04:43:07.870
SHOWS THAT THE AB AGROCHEMICAL.

04:43:07.937 --> 04:43:09.405
PLANT IS OUTSIDE AND THE GAP

04:43:09.472 --> 04:43:12.542
ROOFING COMPANY IS OUTSIDE.

04:43:12.608 --> 04:43:14.110
WHICH THEY ARE VERY GRATEFUL.

04:43:14.177 --> 04:43:16.212
FOR THE THIS INDICATOR MAP IS OF

04:43:16.279 --> 04:43:18.581
THE PM TWO POINT FIVE WHICH

04:43:18.648 --> 04:43:19.982
SHOWS THAT.

THE PREVIOUS INVENTORY AND THIS

IS THE NEW SEVEN MILE INVENTORY

04:44:03.359 --> 04:44:04.861

I HAD A QUESTION OF ARE COMMON

04:48:25.021 --> 04:48:27.256
ABOUT THE BOUNDARIES THAT RESET

04:48:27.323 --> 04:48:29.592
AND EIGHTEEN THE INTENTIONAL IS

04:48:29.659 --> 04:48:30.559
THAT WE DO LEARN AND WE GROW

04:48:30.626 --> 04:48:33.729

TO CHANGING THE BOUNDARY I I

04:48:55.151 --> 04:48:56.686
THINK THE THE MAIN ISSUE THERE

04:48:56.752 --> 04:48:58.020
IS REALLY GOING TO COME DOWN TO

04:48:58.087 --> 04:48:59.055
UNDER AS YOU KNOW UNDER THE

04:48:59.121 --> 04:49:00.756
STATUTE THE COMMUNITY SELECTION

WHERE.

04:49:13.736 --> 04:49:17.506
WE GOT SOME STRONG SORT OF FROM

04:49:17.573 --> 04:49:18.107
THE COMMITTEE ON SORT OF WHAT

04:49:18.174 --> 04:49:19.108
THEY WANT TO SEE.

04:49:19.175 --> 04:49:20.242
THE ONLY THING THAT WE NEED TO

04:49:20.309 --> 04:49:22.712

04:52:58.160 --> 04:52:59.461
SEVENTEEN IN THE OPTION IS GOING

04:52:59.528 --> 04:53:00.696

JUST IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES AS A

04:53:06.468 --> 04:53:08.370
WHOLE IN SACRAMENTO'S WE TRIED

04:53:08.437 --> 04:53:09.738
TO GO WITH SOMETHING FAIRLY

04:53:09.805 --> 04:53:11.440
QUANTITATIVE MEANING WE LOOKED

04:53:11.507 --> 04:53:13.943
AT EVERYTHING FROM.

04:53:14.009 --> 04:53:15.477
THE CALLIN BUYERS SCREEN --

04:53:15.544 --> 04:53:18.547
WE TOOK A LOOK AT JUST THOSE

04:53:18.614 --> 04:53:20.482
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WE LOOKED AT

04:53:20.549 --> 04:53:22.217
THE HEALTH RISK NEEDS ASSESSMENT

04:53:22.284 --> 04:53:23.419
WHICH IS A HOSPITAL BASED

04:53:23.485 --> 04:53:24.753
INFORMATION THAT THE LOCAL

04:53:24.820 --> 04:53:26.155
HOSPITAL REQUIRED PUT TOGETHER

04:53:26.221 --> 04:53:27.790
INVOLVED EVERYTHING FROM ASTHMA.

04:53:27.856 --> 04:53:29.692
EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS WE TOOK A

04:53:29.758 --> 04:53:31.994
LOOK AT ECONOMICS WE TOOK A LOOK

AT POVERTY ISSUES WE ALSO TOOK A

04:53:35.698 --> 04:53:37.166
LOOK AT WHERE ARE THEIR PARKS

04:53:37.232 --> 04:53:38.434
WHERE THEIR SCHOOLS WHERE IS THE

04:53:38.500 --> 04:53:39.935
LOCATION OF OUR NEARBY

04:53:40.002 --> 04:53:42.071
BUSINESSES INCLUDING OUR TOXIC

04:53:42.137 --> 04:53:43.639
HOT SPOTS FOR THE TWENTY FIVE

04:53:43.706 --> 04:53:44.640
IDIOT SOURCES.

04:53:44.707 --> 04:53:45.708
DOING ALL THOSE THINGS WE

04:53:45.774 --> 04:53:46.942
BASICALLY SIGNED JUST A

04:53:47.009 --> 04:53:48.911
SCREENING NUMBER TO THEM AND

04:53:48.978 --> 04:53:51.013
FROM THAT THEN WE RANKED OUT TEN

04:53:51.080 --> 04:53:52.848
BROAD COMMUNITIES.

04:53:52.915 --> 04:53:53.949
THE REASON I KNOW THIS RECAP

04:53:54.016 --> 04:53:54.850
EARLIER IN SOME THE OTHER

04:53:54.917 --> 04:53:56.018
PRESENTATIONS THAT YOU SEE SIR

04:53:56.085 --> 04:53:58.220
SOME ODD BOUNDARIES AS A WHOLE

04:53:58.287 --> 04:54:00.222
IS A LOT INFORMATION CENSUS

04:54:00.289 --> 04:54:01.457
TRACT BASED.

04:54:01.523 --> 04:54:02.558
AND CENSUS TRACTS THEMSELVES

04:54:02.625 --> 04:54:06.095
HAVE VERY ODD ANGLES.

04:54:06.161 --> 04:54:08.030
BANDS NOOKS CRANNIES XTERRA.

04:54:08.097 --> 04:54:08.964
SO THEN WE TOOK HIM WE ADDED A

04:54:09.031 --> 04:54:10.666
HALF MILE BUFFER --

04:54:10.733 --> 04:54:12.568
TO THE CENSUS TRACKS THAT'S WHY

04:54:12.634 --> 04:54:14.536
YOU SEE SOME OF THESE.

04:54:14.603 --> 04:54:15.938
CURVING AREAS.

04:54:16.005 --> 04:54:18.207
SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO

04:54:18.273 --> 04:54:19.641
BELIEVE THAT --

04:54:19.708 --> 04:54:20.743
THIS ROBUST APPROACH MORE

04:54:20.809 --> 04:54:22.444
QUICKLY CAPTURES EXPOSURE TO

04:54:22.511 --> 04:54:24.313
POLLUTION AND THE IMPACT ON OUR

04:54:24.380 --> 04:54:25.214
COMMUNITIES.

04:54:25.280 --> 04:54:29.852
AND SO WITH THAT THOUGH THEN

04:54:29.918 --> 04:54:31.587
WILL FOCUS IN ON THE SOUTH

04:54:31.653 --> 04:54:32.588
SECOND FLOOR AND COMMUNITY WHICH

04:54:32.654 --> 04:54:35.457
WAS ACTUALLY SELECTED IN YEAR.

04:54:35.524 --> 04:54:36.925
ONE AND YOU'LL SEE THAT ONCE OF

04:54:36.992 --> 04:54:38.360
A NICE LITTLE CLEAN BOUNDARIES

04:54:38.427 --> 04:54:39.561
ARE CLEANER BOUNDARIES AT THE

04:54:39.628 --> 04:54:41.430
MOMENT ON THIS MAP AND WHERE

04:54:41.497 --> 04:54:42.664
THAT COMES FROM.

04:54:42.731 --> 04:54:44.233
IS THIS SENSE OF IT HARD TO SEE

04:54:44.299 --> 04:54:45.067
ON THIS.

04:54:45.134 --> 04:54:47.369
YOU WILL SEE A DASHED LINE

04:54:47.436 --> 04:54:48.937
INSIDE OF THE OVERALL BOX.

04:54:49.004 --> 04:54:49.872
THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL COMMITTEE

04:54:49.938 --> 04:54:52.574
BOUNDARIES TO THE CALIFORNIA

04:54:52.641 --> 04:54:55.277
RESOURCES BOARD BACK IN THE FALL.

04:54:55.344 --> 04:54:56.979
AND THE FINAL BOUNDARIES ARE

04:54:57.046 --> 04:54:58.680
WHAT CAME OUT OF THE COMMUNITY

04:54:58.747 --> 04:55:01.617
PROCESS OF THEM TAKING A LOOK AT

04:55:01.683 --> 04:55:03.619
THAT THEM LOOKING AT SAYING --

04:55:03.685 --> 04:55:05.521
WHERE DID YOU COME UP WHY YOU

04:55:05.587 --> 04:55:07.022
HAVE THIS NICK HERE WHAT IS TO

04:55:07.089 --> 04:55:08.590
COME UP WITH AND SO THERE

04:55:08.657 --> 04:55:10.526
FEEDBACK ON BOTH?

04:55:10.592 --> 04:55:12.094
BUSINESSES THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT

04:55:12.161 --> 04:55:13.529
JUST WHERE THEY WANTED TO TRY IT

04:55:13.595 --> 04:55:14.863
SO KEEP THE COMMUNITY SOMEWHAT

04:55:14.930 --> 04:55:16.532
DEFINED.

04:55:16.598 --> 04:55:17.332
IN TERMS OF JUST MAKING SURE

04:55:17.399 --> 04:55:20.169
THAT THIS IS A COMMUNITY FOCUS.

04:55:20.235 --> 04:55:20.936
HAS ALWAYS WE GO BACK TO

04:55:21.003 --> 04:55:22.137
PREVIOUS MAP WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

04:55:22.204 --> 04:55:24.306
AREAS TROUT SECTOR THEY'RE ALL

04:55:24.373 --> 04:55:25.474

OF RHETORIC INTO A COMMUNITY

04:55:27.443 --> 04:55:28.977

04:55:29.044 --> 04:55:29.978
THE THOUGHT PROCESS FROM THE

COMMUNITIES THEY ARE THAT TOP

04:55:49.264 --> 04:55:50.899
TWO PERCENTILE OF THE COUNT

04:55:50.966 --> 04:55:52.034
BUYERS SCREEN.

04:55:52.101 --> 04:55:55.137
IT IS RIGHT NEXT TO IN

SO WE WILL HAVE COMMENTS

05:08:46.941 --> 05:08:49.344
AFTERWARDS FROM --

05:08:49.410 --> 05:08:50.912

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA

05:08:54.315 --> 05:08:55.984
COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXICS --

05:08:56.050 --> 05:08:57.719
HOWEVER I HAVE AN ALTER EGO AND

05:08:57.785 --> 05:08:59.320
THAT IS THAT YOU'RE THIS YOU'RE

05:08:59.387 --> 05:09:00.521
CLOSE NATIONAL CLEAN AIR TEAM.

05:09:00.588 --> 05:09:04.125

05:09:04.192 --> 05:09:05.226
THE SIR CLOSE NATIONAL CLEANER

05:09:05.293 --> 05:09:06.628
TEAM I DO A LOT OF WORK ON THE

05:09:06.694 --> 05:09:07.896
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL

05:09:07.962 --> 05:09:09.264
CLEAN AIR ACT.

05:09:09.330 --> 05:09:10.832
AND I JUST WANTED TO JUST

05:09:10.899 --> 05:09:13.268
BRIEFLY PUT THE ACT IN

05:09:13.334 --> 05:09:14.569
PERSPECTIVE AND THAT IS THAT.

05:09:14.636 --> 05:09:16.671
IT HAS A LIMITED NUMBER OF TOOLS

05:09:16.738 --> 05:09:18.339
TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION.

05:09:18.406 --> 05:09:20.308
IT HAS ENFORCEMENT IT HAS

05:09:20.375 --> 05:09:23.044
STANDARD SETTING AND IT HAS

05:09:23.111 --> 05:09:25.647
CHANGES IN --

05:09:25.713 --> 05:09:27.982
BASICALLY ATTAINMENT STATUS

05:09:28.049 --> 05:09:29.550
EATING OF THIS PROGRAM WE WERE

05:09:29.617 --> 05:09:31.786
VERY CLEAR IN ASKING.

05:09:31.853 --> 05:09:33.254
THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES

05:09:33.321 --> 05:09:34.289
BOARD.

05:09:34.355 --> 05:09:35.356
WHATEVER MONITORING YOU'RE GONNA

05:09:35.423 --> 05:09:37.225
DO CAN YOU PLEASE DO IT WITH

05:09:37.292 --> 05:09:39.027
FEDERAL REFERENCE METHOD SO THAT

05:09:39.093 --> 05:09:40.695
WE CAN GET THE BENEFITS OF THE

05:09:40.762 --> 05:09:43.197
ACT --

05:09:43.264 --> 05:09:44.899
BECAUSE WITHOUT THOSE BENEFITS

05:09:44.966 --> 05:09:46.534
IS VERY DIFFICULT CARVE AND THE

05:09:46.601 --> 05:09:49.604
DISTRICTS DO HAVE LIMITED TOOLS.

05:09:49.671 --> 05:09:51.773
FROM AND WE'RE VERY FRUSTRATED

05:09:51.839 --> 05:09:53.141
THEY DO NOT FOLLOW THAT ADVICE

05:09:53.207 --> 05:09:55.543
BECAUSE NOW YEARS GONE BY AND WE

05:09:55.610 --> 05:09:57.578
HAVE NOTHING THAT WE CAN USE TO

05:09:57.645 --> 05:09:59.147
USE ANY OF THE TOOLS AND THE

05:09:59.213 --> 05:10:00.782
FEDERAL ACT ACTUALLY GET

05:10:00.848 --> 05:10:02.483
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS.

05:10:02.550 --> 05:10:03.651
AND MANY OF US --

05:10:03.718 --> 05:10:04.953
ON THE ADVOCACY COMMUNITY OF

05:10:05.019 --> 05:10:06.421
SAID THAT THIS WAS NOT EIGHT AIR

05:10:06.487 --> 05:10:08.256
POLLUTION MONITORING BILL IT IS

05:10:08.323 --> 05:10:09.891
A REDUCTION BILL.

05:10:09.958 --> 05:10:13.461
AND NOW WE SEE THE CONSTANT NEED

05:10:13.528 --> 05:10:15.897
FOR PEOPLE.

05:10:15.964 --> 05:10:17.598
BOND MOST OF THE DISTRICTS CAME

05:10:17.665 --> 05:10:19.334
UP HERE AND SAID IT'S GREAT TO

05:10:19.400 --> 05:10:19.934
HAVE THE FUNDING WE NEED MORE

05:10:20.001 --> 05:10:21.536
PEOPLE.

05:10:21.602 --> 05:10:24.605
SO I WAS GOING TO HAVE A QUICK

05:10:24.672 --> 05:10:25.740
POWER POINT IT HAD A PERSON WITH

05:10:25.807 --> 05:10:27.742
A CLIPBOARD SAYS THIS IS NOT ANY

05:10:27.809 --> 05:10:29.210
MISSION REDUCTION.

05:10:29.277 --> 05:10:32.046
YOU KNOW A ELECTRIC CAR --

05:10:32.113 --> 05:10:34.515
A HYBRID VEHICLE A YOU KNOW ONE

05:10:34.582 --> 05:10:36.217
OF ONE OF THE LIST OF MY

05:10:36.284 --> 05:10:38.419
COLLEAGUES JESSE HAS ALL THESE

05:10:38.486 --> 05:10:39.287
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES.

05:10:39.354 --> 05:10:41.255
SO A NUMBER OF US SORT OF WORKED

05:10:41.322 --> 05:10:42.824
ON EFFORTS TO REDUCE AIR

05:10:42.890 --> 05:10:44.292
POLLUTION IN THE STATE FOR THE

05:10:44.359 --> 05:10:46.027
LAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY.

05:10:46.094 --> 05:10:46.861
ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE

05:10:46.928 --> 05:10:49.130
IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SIX ONE

05:10:49.197 --> 05:10:50.765
SEVEN WE WANT TO EMBRACE THE

05:10:50.832 --> 05:10:52.734
PROMISE TO THESE HIGHLY IMPACTED

05:10:52.800 --> 05:10:54.702
COMMUNITIES OF ACTUALLY GETTING

05:10:54.769 --> 05:10:56.137
CLEANER AIR.

05:10:56.204 --> 05:10:57.472
AND WE'RE NOT SURE THAT WE'RE

05:10:57.538 --> 05:11:02.910
SEEING THAT --

05:11:02.977 --> 05:11:03.544
THERE IS JUST A STUDY THAT CAME

05:11:03.611 --> 05:11:04.746
OUT --

05:11:04.812 --> 05:11:06.247
ACTUALLY YESTERDAY.

05:11:06.314 --> 05:11:07.215
FROM THE WORLD HEALTH

05:11:07.281 --> 05:11:10.184
ORGANIZATION PARTICULAR MATTER.

05:11:10.251 --> 05:11:12.920
IS KILLING MORE PEOPLE GLOBALLY

05:11:12.987 --> 05:11:14.322
THEN SMOKING IS.

05:11:14.389 --> 05:11:16.724
BUT YOU CAN CHOOSE TO SMOKE YOU

05:11:16.791 --> 05:11:17.892
CAN'T CHOOSE NOT TO BREED.

05:11:17.959 --> 05:11:18.860
SO -- THOSE

05:11:18.926 --> 05:11:21.129
ARE MY COMMENTS AND AGAIN WE

05:11:21.195 --> 05:11:22.830
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING.

05:11:22.897 --> 05:11:24.032
COOPERATIVELY WITH THE COMMITTEE

05:11:24.098 --> 05:11:25.566
WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH

05:11:25.633 --> 05:11:27.368
AGENCIES TO TRY TO MAKE THE

05:11:27.435 --> 05:11:31.105
PROMISE OF AB SIX ONE SEVEN REAL.

05:11:31.172 --> 05:11:33.241

LIKE TO SEE IS A QUESTION JUST

05:11:47.388 --> 05:11:48.823
OF THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME.

05:11:48.890 --> 05:11:50.091
THAT THERE'S BEEN SINCE THE BILL

05:11:50.158 --> 05:11:53.094

05:11:53.161 --> 05:11:53.861

OUR SYSTEM AYE KLAY --

05:11:55.897 --> 05:11:56.931
THAT CAN BE DONE IN OTHER WORDS

05:11:56.998 --> 05:11:58.533
DO YOU THINK IF YOU WERE HERE A

05:11:58.599 --> 05:12:00.635
YEAR FROM NOW YOU WOULD HAVE A

05:12:00.701 --> 05:12:04.005
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

05:12:04.072 --> 05:12:05.206
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT

05:12:05.273 --> 05:12:06.240
PERSPECTIVE.

WE WILL SEE IF WE HAVE A

05:12:09.410 --> 05:12:11.746
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE BUT THE

05:12:11.813 --> 05:12:13.014
ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND

05:12:13.081 --> 05:12:15.249
ESPECIALLY ON STATIONARY SOURCES.

05:12:15.316 --> 05:12:17.018
IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE

05:12:17.085 --> 05:12:18.953
REDUCTIONS.

05:12:19.020 --> 05:12:20.354
FROM STATIONARY SOURCES IN

05:12:20.421 --> 05:12:22.056
CALIFORNIA HAD ACTUALLY OCCURRED

05:12:22.123 --> 05:12:23.925
THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

05:12:23.991 --> 05:12:25.193
THE FEDERAL ACT.

05:12:25.259 --> 05:12:27.528

TO BILL IMPLEMENTING.

05:12:36.003 --> 05:12:37.805
IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED ALREADY BY

05:21:37.411 --> 05:21:38.846
DOCUMENTED CONSENSUS ON THIS

05:21:38.912 --> 05:21:40.648
ISSUE.

05:21:40.714 --> 05:21:43.517
WE HEARD NO CONCERNS RAISED BY

05:21:43.584 --> 05:21:46.387
THE DISTRICT AT THAT TIME --

05:21:46.453 --> 05:21:48.522
OUR COMMUNITY ADVOCACY GROUP --

05:21:48.589 --> 05:21:50.290
AFTERWARD REACHED OUT TO THE

05:21:50.357 --> 05:21:51.458
DISTRICTS TO ASSIST WITH THE

05:21:51.525 --> 05:21:54.395
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS EXPANSION.

05:21:54.461 --> 05:21:55.996
AT OUR MARCH MEETING WITH

05:21:56.063 --> 05:21:58.499
MINIMAL PREPARATION TIME GIVEN

05:21:58.565 --> 05:21:59.533
TO THE COMMITTEE.

05:21:59.600 --> 05:22:00.934
THE DISTRICT SAID THAT THEY

05:22:01.001 --> 05:22:03.270
COULD NOT FOLLOW THE COMMUNITIES

05:22:03.337 --> 05:22:04.438
CONSENSUS.

05:22:04.505 --> 05:22:06.540
THEY CITED THE PRINCIPLE THAT

05:22:06.607 --> 05:22:08.642
THEY SHOULD KEEP TO A ARBY'S

05:22:08.709 --> 05:22:10.711
ORIGINAL BOUNDARIES AS CLOSE AS

05:22:10.778 --> 05:22:12.546
POSSIBLE.

05:22:12.613 --> 05:22:14.081
THE MARCH MEETING WAS TOTALLY

05:22:14.148 --> 05:22:16.784
CONSUMED BY AGAIN REVISITING THE

05:22:16.850 --> 05:22:18.819
EXPANSION OF BOUNDARIES ISSUE.

05:22:18.886 --> 05:22:21.889
BUT AS THE DISTRICT WAS UNABLE

05:22:21.955 --> 05:22:22.890
TO DEFINITIVELY CITE ANY

05:22:22.956 --> 05:22:25.459
SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH

05:22:25.526 --> 05:22:27.327
THE CONSENSUS BOUNDARIES. FOR

05:22:27.394 --> 05:22:28.929
WITH ANY NEW PROPOSALS.

05:22:28.996 --> 05:22:30.264
WE COULD HAVE VERY LITTLE

05:22:30.330 --> 05:22:32.399
MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION.

05:22:32.466 --> 05:22:33.634
IN THE END THE DISTRICT PROMISED

05:22:33.701 --> 05:22:35.669
ONLY TO TAKE OUR SUGGESTIONS

05:22:35.736 --> 05:22:37.037
INTO ACCOUNT.

05:22:37.104 --> 05:22:39.807
WHEN DECIDING THE BOUNDARIES ON

05:22:39.873 --> 05:22:42.276
THEIR OWN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS?

05:22:42.342 --> 05:22:43.911
THE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT IN

05:22:43.977 --> 05:22:46.380
THE SIX SEVENTEEN CHARTER SAYS

05:22:46.447 --> 05:22:48.015
THAT MEMBERS SHALL RESOLVE

05:22:48.082 --> 05:22:50.284
CONFLICTS IN A SWIFT POSITIVE

05:22:50.350 --> 05:22:51.919

BY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THE

05:22:54.188 --> 05:22:55.422
MEETINGS.

05:22:55.489 --> 05:22:57.324
THE CLEAR VIEW OF THE COMMUNITY

05:22:57.391 --> 05:22:59.593
IS THAT THIS DISTRICT FAILED TO

05:22:59.660 --> 05:23:00.761
RAISE CONCERNS IN ANY TIMELY

05:23:00.828 --> 05:23:02.429
MANNER [inaudible]

05:23:02.496 --> 05:23:04.498
FAILED -- TO

05:23:04.565 --> 05:23:06.300
FACILITATE A WAY TO RESOLVE THIS

05:23:06.366 --> 05:23:08.235
CONFLICT.

05:23:08.302 --> 05:23:10.137
WE CANNOT PROCEED IF THE

05:23:10.204 --> 05:23:11.705
DISTRICT DOESN'T PLAY BY THE

05:23:11.772 --> 05:23:14.141
RULES FOR EFFECTIVE DISCUSSION

05:23:14.208 --> 05:23:17.311
THAT THEY THEMSELVES LAID DOWN.

05:23:17.377 --> 05:23:19.813
WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF A

05:23:19.880 --> 05:23:22.716
PLAN INFORMED BY THE COMMUNITY.

05:23:22.783 --> 05:23:24.351
IF THE DISTRICT DISREGARDS THE

05:23:24.418 --> 05:23:26.887
WILL OF THE COMMUNITY.

05:23:26.954 --> 05:23:28.255
THE MEMBERS OF THE FRESNO

05:23:28.322 --> 05:23:30.190
STEERING COMMUNITY OF LIKE MANY

05:23:30.257 --> 05:23:31.291

05:23:34.762 --> 05:23:35.929
DISEASE TODAY.

05:23:35.996 --> 05:23:37.931
SO WE NEED SIX SEVENTEEN TO

05:23:39.600 --> 05:23:41.735

AS FAR AS A COMMUNITY INPUT GOES

05:23:57.751 --> 05:23:59.386
THE FEELING IS THAT WE ARE STILL

THEY WILL BE THE BLUEPRINT FOR

05:25:07.454 --> 05:25:08.722
THE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES THAT

05:25:08.789 --> 05:25:09.489
NEED TO COME ALONG THE WAY AND I

05:25:09.556 --> 05:25:10.357
THINK.

05:25:10.424 --> 05:25:11.658
THAT THERE ARE DEFINITELY A LOT

05:25:11.725 --> 05:25:13.827
OF LESSONS TO BE. TO BE HAD I

05:25:13.894 --> 05:25:15.062
THINK THAT THIS QUESTION AROUND

05:25:15.128 --> 05:25:17.764
BOUNDARIES IS IMPORTANT I THINK

05:25:17.831 --> 05:25:19.199
THE DISCUSSION AROUND.

05:25:19.266 --> 05:25:21.268
LAND USE IS IMPORTANT --

05:25:21.335 --> 05:25:24.304
THE DISCUSSION OF IS IMPORTANT

05:25:24.371 --> 05:25:25.906
AND SO I HOPE THAT.

05:25:25.973 --> 05:25:27.641
THE AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT THEY

05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:29.476
ARE BE AT THE LOCAL OR DISTRICTS

05:25:29.543 --> 05:25:30.811

DO NOW TO THE PROCESS AND THAT

05:25:33.981 --> 05:25:35.449
WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF

05:25:35.515 --> 05:25:36.950
THERE IS A CONSENSUS AND IS THE

05:25:37.017 --> 05:25:37.618
PHONE THAT WHERE WE WERE WITH

05:25:37.684 --> 05:25:39.519
THAT WERE YOU WE WERE AT TO

05:25:39.586 --> 05:25:39.853
BEGIN WITH.

05:25:39.920 --> 05:25:41.355
HOW DID WE ADOPT SOME OF THAT

05:25:41.421 --> 05:25:42.322
CONSENSUS?

05:25:42.389 --> 05:25:43.757
ALONG THE WAY SO THAT IT IS

05:25:43.824 --> 05:25:45.592
COMMUNITY DRIVEN THIS IS ONLY

05:25:45.659 --> 05:25:46.894

IN A MEANINGFUL WAY SO THE

05:27:53.420 --> 05:27:57.824
COMMUNITY THAT ARE YOU KNOW IT --

05:27:57.891 --> 05:27:59.659
EXTREMELY IMPACTED BY PUT BY

05:27:59.726 --> 05:28:00.927
POLLUTION --

05:28:00.994 --> 05:28:02.429
BUT THEY'RE ALSO COMMUNITIES

05:28:02.496 --> 05:28:03.196
THAT HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED AND

05:28:03.263 --> 05:28:05.198
NEVER NEVER REALLY LISTEN TO

05:28:05.265 --> 05:28:06.600
NEVER BROUGHT TO THE TABLE FOR A

05:28:06.666 --> 05:28:08.468
VARIETY OF REASONS SO HAVING A

05:28:08.535 --> 05:28:09.403
TOOL LIKE THIS THAT REALLY

05:28:09.469 --> 05:28:10.704
FORCES.

05:28:10.771 --> 05:28:11.972
THEM TO BE LISTENED TO AND AND

05:28:12.039 --> 05:28:13.507
GIVE SOME THAT SEAT AT THE TABLE

05:28:13.573 --> 05:28:16.743
IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU

05:28:16.810 --> 05:28:17.878
KNOW IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR

05:28:17.944 --> 05:28:19.279
THE RANGE OF EXPERIENCES.

05:28:19.346 --> 05:28:20.680
IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THERE'S

05:28:20.747 --> 05:28:21.948
CERTAINLY --

05:28:22.015 --> 05:28:22.983
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LESSEN

05:28:23.050 --> 05:28:25.085
LEARNING OVER THE PAST YEAR AND

05:28:25.152 --> 05:28:26.319
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING

05:28:26.386 --> 05:28:28.922
ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT STARTED

05:28:28.989 --> 05:28:29.289
OUT BEING MAYBE.

05:28:29.356 --> 05:28:30.891
I'M -- NOT

05:28:30.957 --> 05:28:31.625
REALLY FORMED AND REALLY

05:28:31.691 --> 05:28:32.959
STARTING TO HONE IN ON FOR WHAT

05:28:33.026 --> 05:28:34.628
THAT INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY IN

05:28:34.694 --> 05:28:36.063
THAT INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT.

05:28:36.129 --> 05:28:38.331
IS WORKING AND THAT'S GREAT NEWS --

05:28:38.398 --> 05:28:39.366
LESSONS THAT I KNOW WE'RE GOING

05:28:39.433 --> 05:28:40.567
TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD --

05:28:40.634 --> 05:28:42.335
YOU KNOW INTO THE NEXT ROUND OF

05:28:42.402 --> 05:28:44.004
COMMUNITIES AND AND YOU KNOW IS

05:28:44.071 --> 05:28:45.272
THIS MOVES INTO THE FUTURE.

05:28:45.338 --> 05:28:46.907
I'M ALSO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YOU

05:28:46.973 --> 05:28:48.141
KNOW FRUSTRATION AT YOU KNOW

05:28:48.208 --> 05:28:50.110
SLOWNESS IN SOME AREAS OF

05:28:50.177 --> 05:28:51.378
PERCEPTION THAT THINGS AREN'T

05:28:51.445 --> 05:28:52.646
MOVING AS QUICKLY AS THEY WOULD

05:28:52.712 --> 05:28:53.547
LIKE AND SO.

05:28:53.613 --> 05:28:54.648
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

05:28:54.714 --> 05:28:56.149
TO BE DONE BUT I THINK IT'S

05:28:56.216 --> 05:28:57.484
REALLY ENCOURAGING TO SEE.

05:28:57.551 --> 05:28:59.419
THE AMOUNT OF PASSIONATE PEOPLE

05:28:59.486 --> 05:29:00.654
WEREN'T PASSIONATE THEN.

05:29:00.720 --> 05:29:02.189
YOU KNOW WE WOULDN'T HAVE A TOOL

05:29:02.255 --> 05:29:04.591
THAT WAS REALLY USED AND THEY

05:29:04.658 --> 05:29:05.225
STAYED HOME IT'S BECAUSE THEY

05:29:05.292 --> 05:29:06.726
DIDN'T SEE VALUE IN THIS SO I

05:29:06.793 --> 05:29:07.427
THINK THAT BECAUSE SO MANY

05:29:07.494 --> 05:29:08.495
PEOPLE.

05:29:08.562 --> 05:29:09.729
ARE DEDICATED TO MAKING THE MOST

05:29:09.796 --> 05:29:11.364
OF IT AND MAKING IT WORK BECAUSE

05:29:11.431 --> 05:29:12.966
WE KNOW AT THIS POINT.

05:29:13.033 --> 05:29:14.101
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS FOR THE

05:29:14.167 --> 05:29:15.502
COMMUNITIES WE'VE HEARD IT OVER

05:29:15.569 --> 05:29:17.104
AND OVER AGAIN --

05:29:17.170 --> 05:29:18.305
I THINK I THINK YOU KNOW I'M

05:29:18.371 --> 05:29:20.140
REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THAT AND

05:29:20.207 --> 05:29:21.408
CLEARLY WILL HAVE TO DO THIS

05:29:21.475 --> 05:29:23.677
