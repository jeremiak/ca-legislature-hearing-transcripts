INFRACTIONS. OKAY LET ME LET ME

00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:09.479

SHOULD HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:15.886
TAKEN AWAY SO THAT HAPPENS- THE

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:17.521
FIRST TIME AS I AS I UNDERSTAND

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:19.523
WRITTEN THE WAY WE DRIVE TODAY-

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:20.791

THE COURTS CAN DO BECAUSE-

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:38.041

INCREASE UP TO FIFTY PERCENT. I

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:48.585
CAN SEND FTD BUT WHAT THE CORE

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:50.420
OF THIS REALLY IS TRYING TO DO

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.121
IN THE DOES HAPPEN MYSELF

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:54.791
ALMOST RECENTLY- OR I- GOT A

ULTIMATELY CUT COSTS. US A LOT

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.468
MORE THAN TO ALLOW THEM TO

CONTINUE WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:13.904

DRIVER'S LICENSE IS DRIVING IS

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:20.303

CAN. I CAN APPRECIATE- THAT

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:56.325
SENTIMENT I GUESS THAT MY

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:58.827
CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE. WELL

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:02.231
WE'RE LINKING TWO THINGS THAT

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:03.065
ARE KIND OF APPLES AND ORANGES

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:05.133
SO YOU HAVE I'M SORRY WHAT TO

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.569
THINK THAT WHAT WE WERE LINKING

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:08.604
TO THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO SAY

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.672
WE HAVE WE'RE LOOKING LIVE OVER

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:12.107
FOR STANDARDS TO LIKE EVEY

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:16.078
INCENTIVES- WHICH WOULD GO TO

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:17.546
THE CONSUMER NOT TO THE

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:20.115
MANUFACTURERS SO WE'RE- WE'RE-

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.817
WE'RE KIND OF. PUTTING THOSE

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:23.085
TWO THINGS TOGETHER SO I GUESS

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.586
THAT IS A MAYBE IT LEADS TO MY

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.421
SECOND QUESTION IS THAT. MY

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:27.656
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS BILL

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.758
REQUIRES THE MANUFACTURER. TO

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:31.059
REIMBURSE THE STATE IN THE

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:33.195
EVENT THAT IS A VIOLATION. EVEN

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:34.763
THOUGH THE EEVEE INCENTIVES GO

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:35.864
TO THE CONSUMERS NOT THE MAIN

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:38.200
FACTORS SO I WAS MAYBE YOU CAN-

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:39.902
EXPLAINED. THAT THE THOUGHT

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:42.271
PROCESS THERE SO PUBLIC DOLLARS

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:43.705
THAT ARE USE FOR ANY TYPE OF

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:45.240
INCENTIVE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:47.409
TO DO HERE. IS ALONG THE REAL

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:50.279
CONVERSATION ABOUT A JUST

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:52.147
TRANSITION. SO AS LARGEST. WE

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:53.548
OFTEN TALK ABOUT WHAT A JUST

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:55.250
TRANSITION OF WORKERS LOOKS

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:57.052
LIKE FIVE YOU'RE SEEN THAT PLAY

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.320
OUT IN THE CONVERSATION AROUND

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.988
FOSSIL FUELS AND FOSSIL FUEL

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.156
EMISSIONS AND THE WORKERS THAT%

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.392
WORK AT. REFINERY THIS IS A

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.227
VERY SIMILAR CONVERSATION AND

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:06.495
IT SEEMS A LITTLE STRANGE

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:08.263
BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY HAS NEVER

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.032
BEEN DONE. PART OF THE

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:11.566
COMMENTARY THAT I RECEIVED ON

01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:13.268
THIS BILL. EVEN WHEN WE ARE

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:15.103
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT PRIORITIES

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.271
FOR SOME OF THE CAUCUSES IS

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:17.940
THIS A LABOR BILL. OR IS THIS

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:20.409
AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BILL

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:22.711
IT'S BOTH. AND THAT'S THAT'S

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:24.680
THE SITUATION AND CONUNDRUM

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:26.214
THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN. IS

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:27.683
THAT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.751
ADDRESS TRANSITION OF WORKERS.

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.186
AND ENSURE THAT THE WORKERS

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:32.554
HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES A GOOD

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:35.457
JOB. INCENTIVES BENEFITS ALL OF

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.291
THOSE THINGS WITHOUT BEING

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:38.160
MISCLASSIFIED. AND TYING IT

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:40.262
INTO LABOR LAW AND TYING IT

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:41.129
INTO ONE OF OUR MENTAL CLIMATE

01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:43.365
CHANGE GOALS. THAT THE FAITH

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.334
THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN. AND

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.735
THAT'S WHY YES IT'S NEW IT'S

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.437
INNOVATIVE IT HASN'T BEEN DONE

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:49.905
BEFORE AND THOSE ARE. THE

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:51.606
QUESTIONS THAT I THINK YOU AND

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:52.941

ALL SITUATION GIVEN THEY HAD

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:02.050
MOVED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.118
IS THAT IT ACTUALLY SET THE

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:04.386
TONE IT ACTUALLY SET THE

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:06.588
PATHWAY. OF THE OF A JUST

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:07.622
TRANSITION AND WHAT THAT COULD

01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:09.358
ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE BOTH FOR

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:11.626

THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE IN. AND

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:39.474
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE I ALSO

KNOW WE HAVE GOOD PAYING UNION

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:42.977
JOBS RIGHT THAT ARE- THAT FEW

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.378
PEOPLE FAMILIES AND THE BALANCE

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:45.680
OF THOSE TWO THINGS AND HOW YOU

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:47.381
DO THAT. IT IS NOT AN EASY

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:48.716
QUESTION TO TACKLE BUT IT'S A

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:49.751
CRITICAL ONCE I WHEN IT

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:51.119
ACTUALLY THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:51.786

YOU IN THE SPACE OR OTHERS- TO

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:58.760
THAT END. I DO HAVE A QUESTION

01:29:58.826 --> 01:29:59.694
THOUGH ALSO JUST THAT WAS

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:01.596
RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. AND

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:03.965
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT- SOME

01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:05.600
MEMBER BERMAN AND TOUCHED ON

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:06.768
I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT IT THIS

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:08.803
IDEA THAT- MANUFACTURERS FROM

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:09.771
OTHER STATES ALMOST HAVE A

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:11.339
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THEY

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:12.306
WOULD HAVE THE SAME LABOR

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:13.975
CENTER COULD YOU JUST ADDRESS

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:17.044
THAT- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. SURE

01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:20.848
WE TOOK A NUMBER OF- OF

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:22.049
AMENDMENTS TO HELP. ALSO

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:23.484

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:25.219
MAKE SURE THAT- WE HVE THE

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:26.821
LATEST INFORMATION FOR YOU AND

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:28.723
I'M I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS.

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:30.291
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE- WHEN YOU

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:32.326
THINK ABOUT WHERE. AT IN THE

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:33.394
ASSEMBLY PART OF THE

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:34.929
MANUFACTURING IS A BIG PART OF

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:37.231
THE QUESTION TOO IF- IF A

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:39.433
BUMPER IS MADE IN CHINA AND

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.169
THEN. BROUGHT TO THE U. S. AND

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:43.237
MANY FISH AND PUT AN ASSEMBLED.

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:45.573
IN A FACTORY IN DETROIT. IS

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.575
THAT CONSIDERED AMERICAN MADE.

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:48.910
SO THOSE ARE A LOT OF THE

01:30:48.976 --> 01:30:50.344
QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:52.280
DETERMINE SOMETHING TO BE. U.

01:30:52.346 --> 01:30:55.082
S. MADE OR NOT- THE SAME. AS

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:56.617
STANDARD AS APPLYING TO WORDS-

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:58.019
DIFFERENT STATES AND WHAT WE

01:30:58.085 --> 01:30:59.754
AGREED TO. ONE IS THAT THE

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:02.590
BIGGEST- COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:04.091
MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER STATES

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:05.860
HAVE IS ACTUALLY OW WAGES IN

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:06.994
RIGHT TO WORK LAWS WHICH ARE

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:09.063
VERY DIFFERENT. THAN CALIFORNIA

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:10.431
STATE LABOR LAWS. SO THE

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:11.666
MINIMUM WAGE FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.601
ALABAMA AND SEVEN DOLLARS AND

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:15.469
TWENTY FIVE CENTS. FAR BELOW.

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:17.872
WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS. AB SEVEN

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:18.439
NINE FOUR REQUIRES

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:20.074
MANUFACTURERS TO PAY A HUNDRED

01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:21.876
AND 20% OF THE CALIFORNIA.

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:23.644
MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL WORKERS

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:24.445
AND THE PREVAILING WAGE FOR

01:31:24.512 --> 01:31:26.080
PRODUCTION WORKERS. IN AUTO

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.983
MANUFACTURING TO QUALIFY. SO WE

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:29.984
ARE SETTING THE TONE

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:31.652
DIFFERENTLY. WE ARE SETTING A

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:33.454
DIFFERENT AGENDA. WE ARE SAYING

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:35.790
WE WANT TO CREATE JOBS. WE WANT

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:37.358

AMERICAN WORKERS TO DO. WHAT WE

01:31:44.198 --> 01:31:44.732
OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AND

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.534
ENSURE THAT. PRODUCTION

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:48.302
MANUFACTURING ASSEMBLING TAKES

01:31:48.369 --> 01:31:49.604
PLACE HERE. THOSE ARE THE

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:50.938
MANDATE TO BUILD BACK BETTER

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:52.940
AND CALIFORNIA. IS ALREADY

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:55.877
LEADING ON THAT UNTIL. THE YES.

PROBLEMS WITH INFRASTRUCTURE

02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:25.590

PUTTING A LOT OF CONDITIONS IN

IT AND ULTIMATELY- TRUSTING

02:19:34.165 --> 02:19:35.166
THAT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES

02:19:35.233 --> 02:19:36.568
INCLUDING MY CITY CENTRE THEY

02:19:36.634 --> 02:19:37.402
WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS

02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:38.603
EFFECTIVELY AND KEEP YOUR SEATS

02:19:38.670 --> 02:19:40.171

THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY FAR TOO

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:44.909
MANY PEOPLE HAVE OR THEIR LOVED

HAPPENING AND THIS IS A

02:19:47.512 --> 02:19:49.180
SYSTEMIC ISSUE AND I THINK THAT

WE'RE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY

02:19:50.648 --> 02:19:53.084

POLICE DISCRETION AS WELL FROM

02:20:01.426 --> 02:20:02.660
TRAFFIC INCIDENTS SO I THINK

02:20:02.727 --> 02:20:03.962
THIS BILL IS GREAT BECAUSE IT

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:05.597
DOES TWO THINGS AT ONE TIME.

02:20:05.663 --> 02:20:07.766
AND HOPE THAT MORE COMMUNITIES-

02:20:07.832 --> 02:20:08.600
AND MORE CITIES WILL BILL THE

02:20:08.666 --> 02:20:10.502

02:20:17.375 --> 02:20:18.543
BURDENSOME ESPECIALLY FOR LOW

02:20:18.610 --> 02:20:19.577
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW

02:20:19.644 --> 02:20:21.412
THAT. I TRUST THIS AUTHOR TO

02:20:21.479 --> 02:20:22.280
KEEP WORKING WITH THE

02:20:49.274 --> 02:20:49.974
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ON

02:20:50.041 --> 02:20:51.309
THIS BILL I'M NOT GOING TO BE

02:20:51.376 --> 02:20:52.577
OUT THERE BUT THE CITY IS SAN

02:20:52.644 --> 02:20:54.112
JOSE WHICH IS A STRONG.

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:55.947
PROPONENT OF THE BILL WE HAVE.

02:20:56.014 --> 02:20:57.749
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

02:20:57.816 --> 02:21:00.151
PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES OVER THE

02:21:00.218 --> 02:21:01.953
YEARS AND FORTUNATELY I DON'T

02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:04.122
THINK THAT THE STAFF REPORT

02:21:04.189 --> 02:21:06.324
ANALYSIS OF PROBABLY POINTS OUT

02:21:06.391 --> 02:21:07.859
THAT- AUTOMATED SPEED

02:21:07.926 --> 02:21:09.994
ENFORCEMENT CAN ABSOLUTELY HAVE

02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:11.496
A POSITIVE IMPACT IN TERMS OF

02:21:11.563 --> 02:21:13.064
DISCRIMINATIVE DISCRIMINATORY

02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:14.933
TRAFFIC STOPS OF BUT THE SAME

02:21:14.999 --> 02:21:16.267
TIME THE AREAS WHERE THEY GET

02:21:16.334 --> 02:21:18.136
LOCATED ALSO TEND TO BE HIGHER

02:21:18.203 --> 02:21:19.838
DENSITY TEND TO BE. THE SAME

02:21:19.904 --> 02:21:21.773
COMMUNITIES THAT ALSO TEND TO

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:25.009
GET- MITIGATED MORE- DO BY

02:21:25.076 --> 02:21:26.644
EITHER WAY AND SO I DO

02:21:26.711 --> 02:21:28.580
APPRECIATE IS A MOTHER CALLING

02:21:28.646 --> 02:21:30.481
FROM SAN JOSE POINTED OUT OF

02:21:30.548 --> 02:21:32.383
ALL THE MEASURES THAT ARE TAKEN

02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:33.785
TO DEAL WITH ISSUES OF EQUITY

02:21:33.852 --> 02:21:36.354
BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY WE KNOW.

02:21:36.421 --> 02:21:38.289
THIS PROGRAM AND FOR FIVE YEARS

02:21:38.356 --> 02:21:40.158
NOT ALL THE MONEY THAT WE'RE

02:21:40.225 --> 02:21:41.326
PUTTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE EVEN

02:21:41.392 --> 02:21:43.328
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HOPEFULLY

02:21:43.394 --> 02:21:43.862
THIS WILL LEAD TO TRAFFIC

02:21:43.928 --> 02:21:45.964
CALMING MEASURES ON THOSE

02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:46.731
CORNERS BECAUSE THAT'S

02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:48.566
ULTIMATELY THE LONG TERM

02:21:48.633 --> 02:21:51.135
SOLUTION IS SAFER STREETS AND

02:21:51.202 --> 02:21:52.437
DOES TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES

02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:54.505
BUT- I DO BELIEVE THAT IN THE

02:21:54.572 --> 02:21:55.306
MEANTIME THERE ARE MEASURES

02:21:55.373 --> 02:21:56.875
LIKE THESE. THAT CAN SLOW THE

02:21:56.941 --> 02:21:59.210
TRAFFIC DOWN AND SAVE LIVES-

02:21:59.277 --> 02:22:01.212
AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY WE

02:22:01.279 --> 02:22:03.414

02:22:03.481 --> 02:22:04.983

02:23:30.969 --> 02:23:32.270
PUTTING AND- IS THE BILL.

02:23:32.337 --> 02:23:34.105
LITERALLY SAYS IF WE DON'T SEE

02:23:34.172 --> 02:23:37.175
A DEMONSTRABLE DROP. IN THE

02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:38.609
BEHAVIOR THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO

02:23:38.676 --> 02:23:40.712
SEE. AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE

02:23:40.778 --> 02:23:42.447
SYSTEMS COULD BE SHUT DOWN- WE

02:23:42.513 --> 02:23:43.648
BASICALLY PUT A NUMBER OF

02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:45.950
REQUIREMENTS- TO. ENSURE THAT

02:23:46.017 --> 02:23:47.285
WERE EITHER GOING TO SEE QUICK

02:23:47.352 --> 02:23:49.887
ACTION AND QUICK RESULTS. FOR

02:23:49.954 --> 02:23:51.255
THE SYSTEMS WILL BE SHUT DOWN.

02:23:51.322 --> 02:23:53.524
SO I THINK HOPEFULLY THAT WILL

02:23:53.591 --> 02:23:55.526
AGAIN CONTINUE TO BUILD-

02:23:55.593 --> 02:23:58.663
CONFIDENCE AND WHAT WE'RE

02:23:58.730 --> 02:23:59.163
TRYING TO DO. THANK YOU

02:23:59.230 --> 02:23:59.998
APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. I

02:24:00.064 --> 02:24:01.966
DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE SO I

02:24:02.033 --> 02:24:03.534
WILL GIVE MY COMMENTS I WANT TO

02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:05.370
FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU. MISTER

02:24:05.436 --> 02:24:07.271
CHIU FOR. WORKING ON THIS ISSUE

02:24:07.338 --> 02:24:11.175
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS- IT'S- AN

02:24:11.242 --> 02:24:12.744
IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I FEEL LKE

02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:14.045
NOW BECAUSE OF THE RIVER

02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:15.513
GROWING REALIZATION ABOUT THE

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:17.482
IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING-

02:24:17.548 --> 02:24:18.716
INTERACTIONS AND A LOT OF

02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:20.752
COMMUNITIES BETWEEN LAW. LAW

02:24:20.818 --> 02:24:22.587
OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC.

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:24.622
BECAUSE OF IMPLICIT BIAS AND

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:26.024
KNOWING THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE GET

02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:27.825
STOPPED MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE.

02:24:27.892 --> 02:24:28.893
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:32.096
BUILD- AUTOMATION AND- FOR

02:24:32.163 --> 02:24:34.432
FAIRNESS AND EQUITY REASONS- I

02:24:34.499 --> 02:24:36.667
WANT TO ALSO THANK MR CHIU FOR

02:24:36.734 --> 02:24:38.202
ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND

02:24:38.269 --> 02:24:39.504
WORKING WITH US SO CLOSELY TO

02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:40.371
MAKE SURE THAT THIS WAS THE

02:24:40.438 --> 02:24:42.140
ABSOLUTE BEST BILL. THAT WE

02:24:42.206 --> 02:24:43.408
COULD BRING FORWARD TO ADDRESS

02:24:43.474 --> 02:24:44.809
ALL OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE

02:24:44.876 --> 02:24:46.144
HEARD IN THE PAST WHICH ARE ALL

02:24:46.210 --> 02:24:48.746
VERY LEGITIMATE- A FEW THINGS

02:24:48.813 --> 02:24:49.714
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT ABOUT THE

02:24:49.781 --> 02:24:52.183
BILL- BESIDES. THE FACT THAT

02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:53.584
IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE CLEARLY

02:24:53.651 --> 02:24:55.086
ABOUT REDUCING SPEEDS BECAUSE

02:24:55.153 --> 02:24:57.188
WE KNOW THAT SPEED. REALLY IS

02:24:57.255 --> 02:24:58.256
THE DETERMINING FACTOR BETWEEN

02:24:58.322 --> 02:25:00.792
SURVIVING. A COLLISION OR NOT

02:25:00.858 --> 02:25:01.459
SURVIVING A COLLISION MORE THAN

02:25:01.526 --> 02:25:05.596
ANYTHING ELSE. THAT THIS BILL

02:25:05.663 --> 02:25:06.564
DOES REQUIRE. WARNINGS BEFORE

02:25:06.631 --> 02:25:08.699
YOU ENTER A SPEED CAMERAS OWN.

02:25:08.766 --> 02:25:09.734
NOT OUT OF FAIRNESS BUT

02:25:09.801 --> 02:25:11.335
ACTUALLY TO REDUCE THE SPEED

02:25:11.402 --> 02:25:12.637
THE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING BECAUSE

02:25:12.703 --> 02:25:14.172
WE THINK OF WHAT WE'RE REALLY

02:25:14.238 --> 02:25:15.273
TRYING TO DO HERE IS GET PEOPLE

02:25:15.339 --> 02:25:16.808
TO SLOW DOWN. SO WE THINK THAT

02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:18.342
HAVING THAT MORNING IN AND OF

02:25:18.409 --> 02:25:19.410
ITSELF AND GET PEOPLE TO SLOW

02:25:19.477 --> 02:25:21.546
DOWN. AND AS HE MENTIONED IF IT

02:25:21.612 --> 02:25:22.980
DOESN'T THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO

02:25:23.047 --> 02:25:24.949
USE THE SYSTEM ANYMORE. IT ALSO

02:25:25.016 --> 02:25:26.017
SAYS THAT IF THEY'RE NOT

02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:27.218
GETTING THE RESULTS THEY WANT

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:28.853
THEY HAVE TO INVEST IN TRAFFIC

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.021
COMING IN ORDER TO USE THE

02:25:30.088 --> 02:25:31.389
SYSTEM TO REALLY ENCOURAGE

02:25:31.456 --> 02:25:32.523
CITIES. TO LOOK AT THIS

02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:33.858
HOLISTICALLY TO MAKE THE

02:25:33.925 --> 02:25:34.892
INVESTMENTS THEY NEED IN THE

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:36.694
ENGINEERING TO MAKE THE ROADS

02:25:36.761 --> 02:25:39.163
SAFER. AND THEN SO THAT WE

02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:40.231
ADDRESS THE CONCERN ABOUT SPEED

02:25:40.298 --> 02:25:41.799
TRAPS. THE MONEY THAT'S

02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:42.733
GENERATED CAN'T GO INTO THE

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:43.901
GENERAL FUND OF THE CITY IT

02:25:43.968 --> 02:25:45.736
GOES RIGHT BACK INTO THOSE VERY

02:25:45.803 --> 02:25:46.637
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HAVING THE

02:25:46.704 --> 02:25:48.773
TICKETS. TO DO THOSE KINDS OF

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:50.408
ROAD IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE THOSE

02:25:50.475 --> 02:25:52.777
COMMUNITIES SAFER. IN ADDITION

02:25:52.844 --> 02:25:53.644
I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU'RE

02:25:53.711 --> 02:25:55.113
GOING TO SPEED YOU WANT TO GET

02:25:55.179 --> 02:25:56.814
A TICKET FROM A SPEED CAMERA

02:25:56.881 --> 02:25:58.416
BECAUSE THESE FINES ARE

02:25:58.483 --> 02:25:59.917
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WHAT

02:25:59.984 --> 02:26:01.719
YOU WOULD GET. FROM A POLICE

02:26:01.786 --> 02:26:03.287
OFFICER AND IF YOU'RE LOW

02:26:03.354 --> 02:26:07.258
INCOME WE ALSO BUILD IN. A A

02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:09.961
REDUCED- FEET FOR LOW INCOME

02:26:10.027 --> 02:26:11.996
RESIDENTS SO. THE BILL CENTERS

02:26:12.063 --> 02:26:13.965
FAIRNESS IT CENTERS EQUITY AND

02:26:14.031 --> 02:26:15.566
IT REALLY HASN'T I TOWARDS THE

02:26:15.633 --> 02:26:17.301
GOAL OF REDUCING SPEEDS AND

02:26:17.368 --> 02:26:19.437
THAT'S BUILT IN OVER AND OVER

02:26:19.504 --> 02:26:21.572
AND OVER AGAIN IN THE BILL. I

02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:23.207
WANT TO I THINK THEAUTHOR THIS

02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:25.042
IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF

02:26:25.109 --> 02:26:26.244
LEGISLATION TO MAKE OUR STREETS

02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:27.578
SAFER ALSO WANT TO THANK LAW

02:26:27.645 --> 02:26:28.946
ENFORCEMENT FOR ACT. AND A

02:26:29.013 --> 02:26:30.948
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

02:26:31.015 --> 02:26:32.116

02:26:32.183 --> 02:26:33.651
OFFER AT AUTHOR AND MOVING

02:26:33.718 --> 02:26:35.686
THEIR OPPOSITION. TAKING THAT

02:26:35.753 --> 02:26:36.687
MAKING SURE THIS BILL IS THE

02:26:36.754 --> 02:26:38.422
BEST BILL COULD BE AND TAKING

02:26:38.489 --> 02:26:39.657
THAT LEAP OF FAITH TO LET THIS

02:26:39.724 --> 02:26:40.691
PILOT PLAY OUT TO THE WE CAN

02:26:40.758 --> 02:26:42.059
ALSO BE DATA. I WOULD

02:26:42.126 --> 02:26:43.728
RESPECTFULLY ASK TO BE ADDED AS

FIRST I'D LIKE TO LET THE

WAS GOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:08.119
THE CONCERNS- BUT. YOU'LL

02:27:08.186 --> 02:27:08.653
REALLY APPRECIATE I THINK

02:27:08.719 --> 02:27:09.253
YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF THE

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:09.854
AT. YOU KNOW I TO ADDRESS OUR

02:27:09.921 --> 02:27:10.454
CALL FROM AUSTIN. AND SOME OF

02:27:10.521 --> 02:27:11.355
HIS. IN SAY THE FOR. WHICH IS.

02:27:11.422 --> 02:27:13.224
RED LIGHT CAMERA PROGRAMS

02:27:13.291 --> 02:27:14.892
ADMITTEDLY HAD A CHECKERED

02:27:14.959 --> 02:27:16.127
HISTORY IN OUR STATE THERE ARE

02:27:16.194 --> 02:27:18.229
MANY MANY MANY CHALLENGES WITH

02:27:18.296 --> 02:27:19.997
THEM. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS

02:27:20.064 --> 02:27:22.400
THIS IS DIFFERENT- AN AUTOMATED

02:27:22.466 --> 02:27:24.302
SPEED ENFORCEMENT NOT ONLY.

02:27:24.368 --> 02:27:26.103
LITERALLY OPERATES DIFFERENTLY.

02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:28.573
BUT WE HAVE. LEARNED ALL OF THE

02:27:28.639 --> 02:27:30.675
MISTAKES. AND LESSONS FROM THE

02:27:30.741 --> 02:27:32.510
PAST TO BUILD AND AS THE CHAIR

02:27:32.577 --> 02:27:33.678
SAID FOR EXAMPLE ISSUES OF

02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:35.346
EQUITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:27:35.413 --> 02:27:37.648
THAT RATHER THAN- A CRIMINAL

02:27:37.715 --> 02:27:39.350
PENALTY OR A POINT ON SOMEONE'S

02:27:39.417 --> 02:27:40.418
RECORD THAT IMPACTS THAT

02:27:40.484 --> 02:27:42.186
INSURANCE THAT COST HUNDREDS OF

02:27:42.253 --> 02:27:43.054
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WE'RE

02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:45.089
TALKING ABOUT- MANY FINES IN

02:27:45.156 --> 02:27:46.324
THE FIFTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:48.626
THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY CAPT- WE'RE

02:27:48.693 --> 02:27:49.560
REALLY TRYING TO THINK THROUGH

02:27:49.627 --> 02:27:51.329
EQUITY. THIS IS NOT ABOUT

02:27:51.395 --> 02:27:53.431
GOTCHA MOMENTS SO THE BILL

02:27:53.497 --> 02:27:55.066
REQUIRES. IF YOU'RE DRIVING IN

02:27:55.132 --> 02:27:56.334
A ZONE YOU WILL SEE SIGNAGE

02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:57.401
THAT SAYS THERE IS A SPEED

02:27:57.468 --> 02:27:59.670
SAFETY. SYSTEM HERE- WE ARE

02:27:59.737 --> 02:28:01.739
REQUIRING JURISDICTIONS TO

02:28:01.806 --> 02:28:03.608
EDUCATE. NEIGHBORHOODS SO THAT

02:28:03.674 --> 02:28:04.976
FOLKS KNOW WITH. WITH PLENTY OF

02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:07.078
TIME- THAT THERE IS A SPEED

02:28:07.144 --> 02:28:10.781
SAFETY SYSTEM- ON TOP OF THAT-

02:28:10.848 --> 02:28:12.483
WE- IF THIS IS ULTIMATELY

02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:14.118
SUCCESSFUL OUR HOPE IS THE

02:28:14.185 --> 02:28:15.586
SYSTEMS ARE MAKING MONEY.

02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:17.455
BECAUSE THE IDEA IS PEOPLE STOP

02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:19.323
SPEEDING. UP AND THAT'S THE

02:28:19.390 --> 02:28:21.292
FUNDAMENTAL GOAL AND TO ENSURE

02:28:21.359 --> 02:28:23.561
THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT REVENUE-

02:28:23.628 --> 02:28:25.463
WE HAVE BAKED INTO THIS BILL.

02:28:25.529 --> 02:28:26.664
AFTER A STRONG SUGGESTION OF

02:28:26.731 --> 02:28:28.366
THE CHAIR A REQUIREMENT THAT

02:28:28.432 --> 02:28:30.868
ANY REVENUES HAVE TO GO BACK TO

02:28:30.935 --> 02:28:32.570
THE COMMUNITIES FOR. STREET

02:28:32.637 --> 02:28:34.205
IMPROVEMENTS- AND THEN AFTER A

02:28:34.272 --> 02:28:35.906
COUPLE YEARS THOSE REVENUES

02:28:35.973 --> 02:28:37.008
WOULD HAVE TO GO TO ACTIVE

02:28:37.074 --> 02:28:38.276
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. BUT

02:28:38.342 --> 02:28:40.544
AGAIN IF THERE'S NO DOCUMENTED

02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:42.747
SUCCESS. THESE PROGRAMS WILL

02:28:42.813 --> 02:28:44.649
SHUT DOWN AND THIS IS AGAIN A

02:28:44.715 --> 02:28:46.417
PILOT FOR FIVE CITIES THAT

02:28:46.484 --> 02:28:49.153
DESPERATELY WANT- LET ME JUST

FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVED

02:29:17.248 --> 02:29:18.983
ONES. DUE TO THIS WE HAVE AN

02:29:19.050 --> 02:29:20.518
OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT IT WITH

02:29:20.584 --> 02:29:22.453
AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TRY AND

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.555
THAT'S MY ASK OF THIS

02:29:24.622 --> 02:29:26.891

FIVE CITIES TO PILOT THIS LET'S

02:29:28.526 --> 02:29:30.261
SEE IF IT WORKS. WE CAN IMPROVE

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:31.862
IT IF WE NEED TO- BUT I CAN

FIRST CHILDREN THAT ARE

02:40:21.812 --> 02:40:23.013
WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE DOING

02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:25.215
THIS BY EXAMPLE THINKING WELL

02:40:25.282 --> 02:40:26.316
IF THEY CAN DO WHAT I CAN DO IT

02:40:26.383 --> 02:40:28.618
I JUST. THAT'S MY CONCERN IS

02:40:28.685 --> 02:40:30.320
YOU KNOW. IN THE DOOR THE

02:40:30.387 --> 02:40:31.688

SEE ANYBODY I CAN GO AHEAD AND

02:40:41.164 --> 02:40:43.300
CROSS OVER. THAT'S MY CONCERN

02:40:43.367 --> 02:40:44.534
WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY IN LIFE

02:40:44.601 --> 02:40:46.536
IT ESPECIALLY WE JUST. GO AHEAD

02:40:46.603 --> 02:40:47.504
AND PASS THE BILL WITH THE

02:40:47.571 --> 02:40:48.939
PILOT PROGRAM BECAUSE OF

02:40:49.006 --> 02:40:50.273
SPEEDING AND THAT'S A CONCERN

02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:52.309
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW SO. IF YOU

02:40:52.376 --> 02:40:54.211

REALLY HITTING ME THANK YOU.

02:40:58.415 --> 02:41:00.384
NOT FOR YOUR QUESTION. I DON'T

02:41:00.450 --> 02:41:02.619
BELIEVE WE SET AN AGE LIMIT. IN

02:41:02.686 --> 02:41:05.422
THIS BUT- AS AS A PARENT IF

02:41:05.489 --> 02:41:06.757
YOUR CHILD IS A CERTAIN AGE I

02:41:06.823 --> 02:41:07.491
WOULD HOPE THEY WOULD BE

02:41:07.557 --> 02:41:09.559
WALKING WITH THEIR PARENTS. I

02:41:09.626 --> 02:41:10.660
THINK THERE ARE DAYS WHERE THEY

02:41:10.727 --> 02:41:12.029
CAN'T MAKE THOSE JUDGMENTS BUT

02:41:12.095 --> 02:41:13.430
I I'M HAPPY TO TALK TO MY STAFF

02:41:13.497 --> 02:41:20.137
AND SEE. IF THERE IS AN AGE

02:41:20.203 --> 02:41:22.105
LIMIT ON THE BILL. WHY SEE ANY.

02:41:22.172 --> 02:41:24.408
ELSE WHICH IS- I WANT TO THANK

02:41:24.474 --> 02:41:25.475
YOU BRING THIS. I THINK THE- IS

02:41:25.542 --> 02:41:27.344
A VERY GOOD BILL. AND JUST TO

02:41:27.411 --> 02:41:28.812
ANSWER. MYSTIQUE IS VERY

02:41:28.879 --> 02:41:30.480
REASONABLE CONCERN I THINK THAT

02:41:30.547 --> 02:41:32.582
THAT IS A BIG CONCERN. MY

02:41:32.649 --> 02:41:34.951
CHILD. IS GOING TO NOT. J. WALK

02:41:35.018 --> 02:41:36.453
WHEN IT'S DANGEROUS. NOT

02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:37.421
BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF

02:41:37.487 --> 02:41:38.588
FORGETTING A TICKET BECAUSE IS

02:41:38.655 --> 02:41:40.090
VERY RARELY A POLICE OFFICER

02:41:40.157 --> 02:41:42.059
AROUND. SHE'S GOING TO LEARN

02:41:42.125 --> 02:41:43.260
NOT TO J. WALK WHEN IT'S

02:41:43.326 --> 02:41:44.461
DANGEROUS BECAUSE I WILL

02:41:44.528 --> 02:41:46.029
EXPLAIN TO HER THE DANGER. OF

02:41:46.096 --> 02:41:47.931
WALKING IN TRAFFIC- THAT'S

02:41:47.998 --> 02:41:48.932
WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE

02:41:48.999 --> 02:41:50.567
SAFER I DON'T THINK ANY THERE

02:41:50.634 --> 02:41:51.968
ARE MANY TIMES WHERE PEOPLE.

02:41:52.035 --> 02:41:53.703
STOP AND LOOK AROUND AND CHOOSE

02:41:53.770 --> 02:41:56.306
TO DO SOMETHING DANGEROUS JUST

02:41:56.373 --> 02:41:56.773
BECAUSE THERE'S NO LAW

02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:57.541
ENFORCEMENT. IS A LOT OF THINGS

02:41:57.607 --> 02:41:58.475
THAT PEOPLE CAN DO THAT ARE

02:41:58.542 --> 02:41:59.476
DANGERS THAT WE DON'T

02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:02.212
CRIMINALIZE- I DON'T. WANT TO

02:42:02.279 --> 02:42:03.113
TELL MY DAUGHTER NOT TO JUMP

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:04.281
OUT OF A SECOND FLOOR WINDOW

02:42:04.347 --> 02:42:05.782
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET ARRESTED.

02:42:05.849 --> 02:42:07.517
I TRY TO EXPLAIN THE DANGERS

02:42:07.584 --> 02:42:08.118
FOR HER AND I THINK THAT WE

02:42:08.185 --> 02:42:09.920
NEED TO TREAT. J. WALKING IN

02:42:09.986 --> 02:42:11.588
THE SAME WAY AND ADDITIONALLY.

02:42:11.655 --> 02:42:13.390
IN MANY PLACES WE HAVE REALLY

02:42:13.457 --> 02:42:15.292
MADE WALKING VERY INCONVENIENT

02:42:15.358 --> 02:42:17.127
AND UNPLEASANT. BECAUSE YOU

02:42:17.194 --> 02:42:18.361
HAVE TO WALK REALLY FAR

02:42:18.428 --> 02:42:19.763
SOMETIMES TO GET TO WITH THE

02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:21.531
LEGAL CROSSWALK. AND HOPEFULLY

02:42:21.598 --> 02:42:22.799
THIS WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE CITIES

02:42:22.866 --> 02:42:24.267
TO LOOK AT THE WEIGHTED

02:42:24.334 --> 02:42:25.035
ENGINEER THEIR STREETS TO MAKE

02:42:25.102 --> 02:42:26.937
THE MORE PLEASANT. AND LASTLY

02:42:27.003 --> 02:42:27.637
I'LL JUST SAY THAT AS SOMEONE

02:42:27.704 --> 02:42:30.407
WHO WALKS AROUND. SACRAMENTO A

02:42:30.474 --> 02:42:32.109
LOT MYSELF AT NIGHT. THERE ARE

02:42:32.175 --> 02:42:33.944
TIMES WHERE I DON'T FEEL SAFE

02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:35.112
TO NINETY ONE. SO I THINK THAT

02:42:35.178 --> 02:42:37.447
THERE ARE REASONS WHY WE SHOULD

02:42:37.514 --> 02:42:40.217
GIVE PEOPLE. THE ABILITY TO USE

02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:42.119
THEIR OWN COMMONSENSE- WHEN

02:42:42.185 --> 02:42:43.954
THEY CROSS THE STREET. RATHER

02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:45.489
THE AND MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER

02:42:45.555 --> 02:42:47.257
IN TERMS OF THE WAY TO DESIGN.

02:42:47.324 --> 02:42:49.159
AND NOT THINK THAT SOMEBODY

02:42:49.226 --> 02:42:50.060
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO

02:42:50.127 --> 02:42:51.328
GET A TICKET IS GOING TO BE THE

02:42:51.394 --> 02:42:52.462
PRIME MOTIVATOR AS TO WHETHER

02:42:52.529 --> 02:42:54.898
THEY ACT. SAFELY OR DANGEROUSLY

02:42:54.965 --> 02:42:56.333
SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD

02:42:56.399 --> 02:42:58.368
BILL I THINK THAT. REDUCING THE

02:42:58.435 --> 02:42:59.903
AMOUNT OF TICKETS THAT PEOPLE

02:42:59.970 --> 02:43:01.204
ARE GIVEN FINES AND SOMETIMES

02:43:01.271 --> 02:43:03.140
VERY UNFAIRLY USING A LOT OF

02:43:03.206 --> 02:43:04.141
IMPLICIT BIAS IN A LOT OF

02:43:04.207 --> 02:43:06.176
BULLYING BEHAVIOR. IS SOMETHING

02:43:06.243 --> 02:43:07.310
THAT WE NEED TO STOP AND I

02:43:07.377 --> 02:43:08.678
THINK THAT THIS BILL IS A GOOD

02:43:08.745 --> 02:43:10.614
STEP TO DO THAT. SO I DID WE

02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:12.015
HAVE A MOTION I FEEL LIKE I

02:43:12.082 --> 02:43:13.250

WHICH THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS

02:44:46.476 --> 02:44:48.211
MANIFESTED ITSELF THROUGHOUT

02:44:48.278 --> 02:44:50.046
THERE ARE STATE THIS PAST YEAR.

NOT SILVER BULLETS THEY ARE

02:44:55.285 --> 02:44:56.519
IMPORTANT STEPS AS WE WORK

TOGETHER TO BRING CALIFORNIA'S

02:44:58.255 --> 02:44:59.022
DATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO TWENTY

02:44:59.089 --> 02:45:00.657
FIRST CENTURY. SINCE TAKING

02:45:00.724 --> 02:45:02.192
OFFICE COMMONSENSE EXPANSION OF

02:45:02.259 --> 02:45:03.727
RURAL BROADBAND ACCESS HAS BEEN

02:45:03.793 --> 02:45:05.595
A PRIORITY OF MINE. THE CONCEPT

02:45:05.662 --> 02:45:07.264
OF DIG ONCE IS NOT A NEW POLICY

02:45:07.330 --> 02:45:09.299
AREA FOR ME. WELL I AM

02:45:09.366 --> 02:45:10.634
FRUSTRATED THE LACK OF PROGRESS

02:45:10.700 --> 02:45:11.668
SINCE I FIRST RAISED THE ISSUE

02:45:11.735 --> 02:45:13.203
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I'M

02:45:13.270 --> 02:45:14.537
HEARTENED BY A COMMITMENT FROM

WHAT WE BELIEVE THERE IS- THERE

02:45:19.509 --> 02:45:21.611
HAS ONLY BEEN A SINGLE INSTANCE

02:45:21.678 --> 02:45:23.046
OF DIG ONCE UTILIZED SINCE I

02:45:23.113 --> 02:45:24.681
STARTEDWORKING ON THAT. THIS

02:45:24.748 --> 02:45:26.616
IS NOT ENOUGH. YOU CAN'T TELL

02:45:26.683 --> 02:45:27.751

CONSTITUENCIES THAT THERE'S

02:45:32.289 --> 02:45:33.857
ONLY BEEN ONE OPPORTUNITY IN

02:45:33.923 --> 02:45:35.892
THE LAST FOUR YEARS. TO DIG

SIMPLE EFFICIENCIES IT

02:45:39.462 --> 02:45:40.930
DRASTICALLY SAVE ON BUILDING

02:45:40.997 --> 02:45:42.599
COSTS WHEN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

02:45:42.666 --> 02:45:44.467

ROADWAYS WE NEED TO DETERMINE

02:45:52.475 --> 02:45:55.578
HOW. NOT IF BROADBAND IS A PART

02:45:55.645 --> 02:45:57.047
