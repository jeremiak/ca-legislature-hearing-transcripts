I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB ONE TWO FOUR. JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS THIS BILL IS A LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL. AB ONE TWENTY FOUR WOULD SUPPORT SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. BY REQUIRING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO CONSIDER THE FULL CONTEXT OF A PERSON'S RELATED CIRCUMSTANCES. AND EXPERIENCES THROUGHOUT THE COURT PROCESS. THE IMPETUS FOR THIS BILL CAME IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY WHEN I WROTE TO THE GOVERNOR IN SUPPORT OF KIANA ALDRICH'S. PETITION FOR COMMUTATION OF SAN. AT AGE. KIANA WAS TO TWO YEARS BE BARS. DESPITE LAWS THAT PROTECT AGAINST VICTIM CRIMINALIZATION FOR HER ALLEGED ROLE IN THE KIDNAPPING AND ROBBERY OF TWO MEN. THESE TWO MEN POSTED AN ONLINE AD LOOKING TO PURCHASE HER FOR SEX AND TO MAKE **** AND YET NEITHER OF THESE MEN FACED ANY CHARGES FOR SOLICITING SEX FROM A MINOR MINOR. KIANA HOWEVER WAS CHARGED AS AN ADULT. PRIOR TO HER CONVICTION KIANA LIVED A LIFE FILLED WITH ABUSE AND TRAUMA AT AGE FIVE HER FATHER WAS CONVICTED OF SEXUALLY MOLESTING HER. SHE SPENT TIME AT JUVENILE HALL AS A YOUTH AT SIXTEEN SHE WAS ARRESTED WITH A FEMALE PIMP AND AGREED TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE WOMAN THOUGH SHE NEVER PROVIDED WAS PROVIDED WITH COUNSELING OR SAVE HOUSING. HAD OUR SYSTEM SUCCESSFULLY INTERVENED AT ANY POINT. KIANA MAY NEVER HAVE LANDED IN PRISON. BUT WE KNOW SYSTEMS FAIL FAR MORE WOMEN THAN KIANA ALONG. THE ACLU ESTIMATES THAT NEARLY 60% OF FEMALE STATE PRISONERS NATIONWIDE AND AS MANY AS 94% OF CERTAIN FEMALE PRISON POPULATIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL ABUSE BEFORE BEING INCARCERATED. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL AND INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND OTHER SEVERE FORMS OF TRAUMA ARE MORE LIKELY TO LAND IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM YES OUR CURRENT. LEGAL FRAME LACKS CLEAR MECHANISMS TO CONSIDER RELEVANT FACTORS AND EXPERIENCES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE. AB ONE TWO FOUR ADDRESSES GAPS AND FAILURES OF THE CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM BY ALLOWING THE COURT TO CONSIDER HOW THE DEFENDANT'S OWN TRAUMA. CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE AND OR CONVICTION SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. IT WILL EXPAND JUDICIAL DISCRETION TO AVOID IMPOSING SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS ON SURVIVORS IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT JUDGES GIVE GREAT WEIGHT TO YOUTHFULNESS TRAUMA SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND VICTIMIZATION THROUGH INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHEN EXERCISING. THEIR DISCRETION AT SENTENCING STAGES. IT WILL ALLOW THE COURTS TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE SURVIVORS EXPERIENCE OF TRAUMA AND OR VIOLENCE WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE. AND IT WOULD EXPAND THE BACK TO TOUR LAW TO APPLY TO CRIMES THAT WERE THE DIRECT RESULT OF BEING A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE. AB ONE TWO FOUR WILL GIVE SURVIVORS A MECHANISM TO SEEK JUSTICE THAT IS HOLISTIC AND REHABILITATIVE. WITH ME HERE IN SUPPORT ARE STILL GRAYSON POLICY ASSOCIATE AT THE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER AND KATE WALKER BROWN DIRECTOR OF COLLABORATIVE RESPONSES TO COMMERCIAL SEXUAL AT EXPLOITATION. AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I THINK WHEN THEY WITNESSES PRESENT MISTER CHAIR WILL BE MISSED KATE BROWN FIRST AND THEN MISS APRIL GRAYSON. OKAY WHAT WHENEVER OPERATOR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. LETTUCES AFTER COURT THANK YOU MISTER CORK. JONES. SAWYER HERE LACKEY HERE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FIND KEEP WALKER BROWN AN ATTORNEY AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE COLLABORATIVE RESPONSES COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION INITIATIVE AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW FOR A DECADE MY TEAM HAS WORKED WITH SURVIVORS A FATE UNIMAGINABLE TRAUMA FOR TRAFFICKING ABUSE AND VIOLENCE. FORCING THEM TO CONTINUALLY FIND WAYS TO SURVIVE THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM HAS ONLY EXACERBATED THAT HARM BURDENING THEM WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS SEPARATING THEM FROM FAMILY AND COMMUNITY AND EXPOSING THEM TO FURTHER TRAUMA AND VIOLENCE FOR TOO LONG CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM HAS PUNISHED THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. OUR PRISON SYSTEM IS FILLED WITH BLACK BROWN INDIGENOUS AND LOW INCOME WOMEN IN ADDITION TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANS AND QUEER THE SAME INDIVIDUALS HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPERIENCE ABUSE AND TRAUMA AS CHILDREN THIS TRAUMA MAKES THEM EVEN MORE VULNERABLE TO COERCION AND MANIPULATION THAT IS AFFECTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. ALTHOUGH PICARD LEGAL SYSTEMS HAVE A BALD RECENTLY RECOGNIZING IMPACT OF AGING TRAUMA ON A PERSONAL BEHAVIOR WE CONTINUE TO CHARGE CONVICT AND INCARCERATE MANY VICTIMS OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE WILL BEHAVIORS ARISING OUT OF WHAT WAS DONE TO THEM IN A- WE ARE BLAMING AND PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR SIMPLY SURVIVING. AB ONE TWENTY FOUR WILL BRING OUR ANTIQUATED CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM INTO THE MODERN DAY BY PROVIDING THE COURTS WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SURVIVORS EXPERIENCES AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME THIS BILL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT. THE IMPACT OF TRAUMA ON DECISION MAKING AND THE DEEPLY COERCIVE MANIPULATIVE AND VIOLENT DYNAMICS THAT ARE PRESENT IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH WILL BE TO DECREASE RECIDIVISM YOUR LONG TERM CULTURAL COSTS WILL INCREASE ARENA. THIS BILL IN NO WAY THE JUDGES. NOR IT OFF ENDED OKAY OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD. BUT INSTEAD ENSURE THAT IT ALL STAGE IN THE CASE. COURTS HAVE MORE INFO. MORE TO.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN Q. THANK YOU WILL GO ON TO- STATEMENTS FROM OPPOSITION. WE HAVE. ERICA GONZALES SUPERVISING DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY TULARE COUNTY. GOOD AFTERNOON AT CHAIRED BY SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ERICA GONZALEZ WITH THE TULARE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WHILE WE SUPPORT THE THEORY BEHIND THIS BILL WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE IT BECAUSE IT IS OVERBROAD AND VAGUE EXISTING LAW ALLOWS THE COURT TO CONSIDER CIRCUMSTANCES AN AGGRAVATION AND OR MITIGATION AND ANY OTHER FACTOR REASONABLY RELATED TO THE SENTENCING DECISION. THE RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CASE RECORD THE PROBATION OFFICER'S REPORT OTHER REPORTS AND STATEMENTS PROPERLY RECEIVED. STATEMENTS IN AGGRAVATION OR MITIGATION WHICH CAN BE FILED BY THAT THE DEFENDANT'S ATTORNEY AND ANY EVIDENCE INTRODUCED AT THE SENTENCING HEARING. COURT ALREADY HAS BROAD DISCRETION TO CONSIDER RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES IN DETERMINING THE MOST APPROPRIATE SENTENCE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE COURT TO IMPOSE A LOWER TERM WHERE TRAUMA USEFULNESS OR HAVING BEEN A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING OR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE WHAT THE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE. HOWEVER IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT TO PROVE ONE OF THESE FACTORS WHETHER IN FACT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR AND WHETHER IT WAS A MINOR OR MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. IF THE COURT REQUIRED TO IMPOSE A LOWER TERMS IF IT WAS IN FACT A MINOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXTEND HUMAN TRAFFICKING AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES I WOULD CREATE A NEW AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE FOR VICTIMS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE. AS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL THESE DEFENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO DEFENDANTS WHO ARE COURSE TO COMMIT A SERIOUS OR VIOLENT OFFENSES. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF BEING A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE. AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A REASONABLE FEAR OF HARM. TO HARM THE FEAR NEED NOT BE SERIOUS NOR VIOLENT THIS IS VERY CONCERNING BECAUSE THIS WOULD CHANGE THIS. WOULD CHANGE. EXCUSE ME THIS CHANGE WOULD EXTEND AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO COMMITS A SERIOUS OR VIOLENT CRIMES INCLUDING MURDER AGAINST ANY PERSON EVEN A CHILD. SINCE THE HARM THE INDIVIDUAL FEARS NEED NOT BE SERIOUS NOR VIOLENT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN ARGUE THEY WERE AFRAID OF A BATTERY AT THE HANDS OF AN INTIMATE PARTNER OR HUMAN TRAFFICKER. THUS ALLOWING THE INDIVIDUAL TO CLAIM AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE FOR CAUSING SERIOUS OR VIOLENT INJURIES. EVEN MURDER TO A CHILD. THIS BILL WILL LIKELY WERE IN IN EQUITIES IN SENTENCING AS THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE EVIDENCE REQUIRED TO PROVE THE INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND WHETHER THE TRAUMA WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR OF THEIR CRIME. INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMIT CRIMES MAY SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST A MITIGATED SENTENCE. IT IS LIKELY THE EVIDENCE REQUIRED WILL INVOLVE EXPERT TESTIMONY INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS. ORDER TO MULTI EXPERTS. ADMINS ALSO INCLUDE ANY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IN ADDITION TO ANY INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE THIS EXPANSION INTO CHILDHOOD TRAUMA WOULD DRASTICALLY EXPAND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND IN TURN DRASTICALLY INCREASE COURT EXPENSES FOR CONDUCTING HEARINGS REGARDING THAT INFORMATION. THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THE COURT TO RECALL AN INMATE'S SENTENCE AND RESENTENCED THEM UPON A MOTION BY THE INMATE DEATHS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN MANY INCARCERATED INMATES MAKING A REQUEST REQUEST TO RECALL THEIR SENTENCE AS WE HAVE SEEN IN PASSED MEASURES WHICH WILL PROVE COSTLY FOR THE COURTS DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS WILL HAVE TO RESPOND AND APPEAR FOR EVERY REQUEST MADE BY AN INMATE. FURTHER AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE PROOF REQUIRED FOR THE COURT IT'S NOT CLEAR. NEXT THE BILL HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MENTAL DEFECT BEING A DEFENSE FOR NOT ONLY SPECIFIC ANTI CRIME STOPPER GENERAL INTENT CRIMES THIS IS A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN LAW THAT UNDERCUTS DECADES OF CASE LAW. CAN THE DICTUM BUILT VICTIMS BILL OF RIGHTS IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. LASTLY THIS BILL MAY LEAD TO GREATER VICTIMIZATION OF INDIVIDUALS BY THEIR ABUSERS. IF THEIR ABUSERS ARE AWARE THAT THEIR VICTIMS WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED OR WILL RECEIVE A LESSER SENTENCE FOR COMMITTING A CRIME. A BIT MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO UTILIZE THEIR VICTIMS TO COMMIT CRIMES THERE IS AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE AND ARREST THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA FOR VICTIMS WHO ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL CONDUCT UNDER THE THREAT OF ANOTHER. WE HAVE SEEN THIS TRAGIC OUTCOME OCCUR OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN OTHER ARENAS. WHEN THE PUNISHMENT OF ADULTS INCREASED FOR SELLING DRUGS ACROSS THE STATE DRUG DEALERS WERE PULLING CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS TEN TO TWELVE YEARS OLD INTO DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. WE HAVE SEEN MINERS BEING USED TO COMMIT GANG CRIMES IDENTITY THEFT AND CRIMES AGAINST OTHER PERSONS. CONCLUDING BEAMS ARE SED AS RICH RECRUITERS FOR TRAFFICKERS. AS STATED EARLIER THE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE AND THIS BILL IS MUCH BROADER THAN BE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE UP TO REST. THAT IS CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH IS VERY CONCERNING FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOW ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SB. FORTY TWO OH TWO. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE VIDEO TELECONFERENCING. YOU CAN NOW OPEN UP OPPOSITION- AT&amp;T AB. ONE TWO FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB ONE TWENTY FOUR HOURS YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AB ONE TWENTY FOUR YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU KNOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER CORK. YEAH FIRST A MOVE THE BILL. R. AND THEN I'LL ASK TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU- SO I HEARD THE OPPOSITION- MOST OF IT I DON'T THINK. IS TERRIBLY CONVINCING I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE ALREADY USING THESE POOR CHILDREN AS- TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION SAID I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE- AND WHILE THEY SAY THAT THERE IS- WASTE CONSIDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT BEING CONSIDERED. SO I THINK THE BILL IS URGENT AND NEEDED. THE ONE CONCERN I DO HAVE AN THIS CAME NOT SO MUCH FROM THE SPEAKER BUT IN THE LETTER THE OPPOSITION FROM THE D. A.'S. IS THE LARGE POTENTIALLY LARGE COSTS AND YOU CAN ANSWER THAT EITHER NOW OR IN YOUR CLOTHES. BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE EXPERT WITNESSES DO INVESTIGATIONS- LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASKING FOR RESENTENCING IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THOSE EITHER NOW OR IN YOUR CLOTHES IT'S UP TO YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU ON AS A CO AUTHOR. I ALSO HAVE JEREMY THORTON ON WHO IS- THE PUBLIC DEFENDER FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE AT SAN DIEGO WHO CAN. PROBABLY ADDITIONALLY ELABORATE ON WHAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU IN RESPONSE- THERE'S STILL A THRESHOLD THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MET- YOU I KNOW THAT THE- OPPOSITION IS CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF THESE SORT OF SELF REFERRALS. FOR THESE ELEVEN SEVENTY DIS- BUT THERE IS CRITERIA THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MET- AND NOT ALL OF THE REFERRALS ARE APPROVED- AND SO THERE WOULD NOT BE- ADDITIONAL CLOGGING IS OF THE COURT BECAUSE I THINK THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THEY WOULD BE UTILIZING PUBLIC DEFENDERS IT'S ALSO REALLY EXPENSIVE TO HAVE- PRIVATE COUNSEL FOR THIS- AND AS I MENTIONED. THERE WOULD BE THRESHOLDS THAT HAVE TO BE MET THIS IS NOT JUST HEY I THINK I WANNA A SECOND LOOK- YOU KNOW AT MY SENTENCE IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO. I BELIEVE IT WAS SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN MISS SKINNER'S BILL- ABOUT FELONY MURDER THERE WAS STILL A THRESHOLD THAT HAD TO BE MET- FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THOSE- BUT JEREMY THORTON IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE IF MAYBE YOU CAN ELABORATE. YES THANK YOU SENATOR- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO TO ADDRESS THE CONSPECIFIC LEE AND SOME OF THE CONTENTIONS FROM THE OPPOSITION- LAW EXPERTS COULD CERTAINLY BE USED- TO ADDRESS THESE- FACTORS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING THE CONDITION AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THAT IS NOT THE SOLE WAY TO DO IT AND FRANKLY THAT MAY NOT EVEN BE THE FIRST WAY THAT DEFENSE LAWYERS OR DEFENDANTS CLIENTS THAT SEEK TO PROVE THIS ONE IS OUR RECORDS- CPS RECORDS POLICE REPORTS- ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES RECORDS ANYTHING THAT CAN THE STAFF WAS THE LEVEL. THE EXISTENCE OF THE CONDITION- THAT FALLS WITHIN ONE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES- ALSO INTERVIEWS YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES THE MOST PROBATIVE EVIDENCE OF CHILD ABUSE CHILD MALTREATMENT OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS FROM TEACHERS AND TEACHERS ARE ARE MANDATORY REPORTERS TEACHERS OBSERVE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME IN CLASSROOMS. AND SO AS A DEFENSE PRACTITIONER WHEN I'M ATTEMPTING TO DEMONSTRATE THE LEVEL DAM OF ABUSE THAT MY CLIENT IS SUSTAINED I WILL ABSOLUTELY GO THROUGH- SCHOOL RECORDS IN INTERVIEW TEACHERS NEIGHBORS ALSO CAN ESTABLISH THINGS LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ABUSE- SO THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE INTERVIEWED. AND IT IS IT IS PUBLIC DEFENDERS AS DEFENSE LAWYERS AND MOSTLY PUBLIC DEFENDERS FRANKLY WHO WILL BE DOING- THE LEGWORK ON MISSION PRESENTING THIS EVIDENCE IN GATHERING THIS EVIDENCE- AND FRANKLY MOST OF THIS IS ALREADY DONE. THIS KIND OF MITIGATION IS NOT UNCOMMON IN OUR PRACTICE IT'S JUST THAT THE QUESTION IS HOW IS THIS MEDICATION USED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND THE COURTS AND THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL DIRECTS- HOW THIS MEDICATION SHOULD BE USED AND- WHAT THE PURPOSES- I ALSO. WANTED TO ADDRESS THERE WAS- THE IDEA OF- CONTRIBUTING FACTOR AND WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED EXPERTS TO PROVE THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COURTS WILL DO AND THAT THE COURTS WILL ADDRESS THAT THEY'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT STANDARD. AND CAN CERTAINLY. A WEIGH IN ON THAT- AND THEN LASTLY SORRY THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S AND IN HAVING TO TURN OVER THE DISCOVERY- DATE WILL CERTAINLY HAVE A BURDEN TO. OFFER THE DEFENSE POLICE REPORTS THAT INDICATE THE CLIENT WAS A VICTIM- BUT THAT'S JUST KIND OF. THE NATURE OF DUE PROCESS IS WHEN THERE IS MITIGATING EVIDENCE OUT THERE PROSECUTORS HAVE A DUTY TO TURN IT OVER AND THAT WILL CONTINUE AND BE EMPHASIZED IN THIS BILL PARTICULAR WHEN OUR CLIENTS HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED. AND THANK YOU THAT THIRTY INCHES MY QUESTIONS AND- I AM STILL A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT COST NOT HERE BUT IF WHEN IT GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS SO JUST THINK ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU% MISTER. ALSO LIKE TO ADD IF I CAN THAT- IN SOME. COUNTIES RIGHT NOW DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES ARE ACTUALLY RESTRUCTURING THEIR DEPARTMENTS- TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE KINDS OF REFERRALS THAT COULD COME IN. AND IN FACT WE TOOK OUT THE SELF REFERRAL- ASPECT OF THE BILL BEFORE SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE OPPOSITION LETTER WAS TALKING ABOUT COSTS IN GENERAL OR COST OF SELF REFERRALS. BUT THAT IS NOT IN THE BILL- CURRENTLY SO I WANTED ALSO SORT OF SHARE THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CIERTA THANK YOU. SO IF THIS BILL WERE NARROWED DOWN TO- FOCUS ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING SEXUAL VIOLENCE. FOR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. ARE I WOULD BE VERY MUCH- INTERESTED IN IN BEING SUPPORT OF A- THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THE PART WHERE. IF THE CRIMINAL DEFENDANT HAS EXPERIENCED ANY PSYCHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL CHILDHOOD TRAUMA BECAUSE- IN CRIMINAL WORLD. THAT CONSTITUTES ABOUT 90% OF THE CRIMINALS AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHY THEY ARE CRIMINALS IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND IT ALSO YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A LARGE POPULATION OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DONE HAVE HAD ALL OF THOSE. AND ARE NOT CRIMINALS AND HAVE NOT DONE CRIMES AND A YOU KNOW SERIAL KILLERS FIT INTO THIS PARTICULAR- DESCRIPTION- I DIDN'T GET THAT WAY ALL BY THEMSELVES. THEY GOT THAT WAY BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA. HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM LESS DANGEROUS TO THE PUBLIC AND IT DOESN'T MAKE THEIR VICTIMS ANYMORE A LIFE. SO YEAH I DID THAT'S THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS IS THEY OVER BROADNESS THAT WAS POINTED OUT I THINK BY ONE OF THE OPPOSITION PRIMARY WITNESSES- AND THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ANY OTHER COMMENTER QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HI- AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR CONCERNS YOU KNOW THAT WAS ALSO SOMETHING THAT- I WRESTLED WITH AS I WAS WORKING WITH THIS BILL- AND THE AND THE ADVOCATES AND HARING ALL OF THE STORIES THAT HAVE COME FROM THE SURVIVORS AND THINKING OF THE STORY OF KIANA ALDRICH IT WAS NOT JUST THAT SHE WAS- SEXUALLY ABUSED AND THAT SHE WAS TRAFFICKED. BUT SHE ALSO HAD A HISTORY OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ADVOCATES AND SURVIVORS OF THESE KINDS OF CRIMES YOU KNOW WANT TO HAVE NEED TO HAVE AND DESERVE TO HAVE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REITERATE THAT THIS BILL. PROVIDES INFORMATION TO THE COURTS. SO THAT JUDGES ARE ABLE TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS AND ARE ABLE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR AND MANY INSTANCES THAT IS NOT ALLOWED. THE BURDEN IS STILL AND WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN. WITH THE DEFENSE. THE BURDEN IS STILL ON THE DEFENSE. AND THE DISCRETION STILL LIES WITH THE JUDGE IN ALL OF THOSE THINGS STILL REMAIN. THIS JUST ALLOWS FOR THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. IT KIANA AS STORY. AND RESENTENCING SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE JUDGE TO RECOGNIZE AND CONSIDER THE FACT THAT SHE WAS BOUGHT. THAT SHE WAS BOUGHT AND THAT SHE WAS USED. AND IT DOESN'T DENY THE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED IN. BUT IT CERTAINLY PLAYS A ROLE AND WHY THAT BEHAVIOR HAPPENED AND THAT IS ALL THIS BILL IS ASKING US TO CONSIDER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU JURORS RECOMMENDED I WILL CALL THE ROLL.

AND JUST PART PERSONAL PROVISIONAL WE WERE HERE BUT THE COURT HAS MADE A DECISION IN MINNEAPOLIS ON THE- DEREK SHOEN TRIAL- HE'S FOUND GUILTY ON ALL THREE CHARGES SECOND DEGREE MURDER WHICH HAS A MAXIMUM OF FORTY YEARS. OF THIRD DEGREE MURDER MURDER WHICH HAS A MAXIMUM TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND SECOND DEGREE MANSLAUGHTER WHICH HAS A MAXIMUM OF TEN YEARS- AND GUILTY ON ALL THREE COUNTS YOU MAY NOW. PRESENT YOUR NEXT BILL. THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION MISTER CHAIR. I WILL NOW PRESENT AB ONE TWO SEVEN TO AMEND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PENAL CODE TO PERMIT AN EMPLOYEE OF A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE. TO PRESENT A PROBABLE CAUSE DETERMINATION TO A JUDGE IN SEEKING AN ARREST WARRANT IN CASES WHEN THE SUBJECT IS A PEACE OFFICER. THE BILL. THE AIM IS TO REDUCE PROCEDURAL BARRIERS TO POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND ELIMINATE ONE OF THE BARRIERS FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND INITIATING PROSECUTIONS AGAINST MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AB ONE TWO SEVEN WILL CLARIFY THAT A DECLARATION OF PROBABLE CAUSE FOR AN ARREST WARRANT NEED NOT BE PROVIDED ONLY BY A PEACE OFFICER. THE PROPOSED CHANGE IN LAW WOULD MAKE NO OTHER CHANGES TO THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING AN ARREST WARRANT BEYOND THE EXPANSION OF POSSIBLE AFGHANS BEYOND PEACE OFFICERS. IT WOULD NOT CHANGE A PROBABLE CAUSE STANDARD OF PROOF AND JUDGES WOULD STILL RETAIN THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE AN ISSUE AN ARREST WARRANT. AB ONE TWO SEVEN WILL ENABLE PROSECUTORS TO ENACT PROSECUTIONS AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND REDUCE PROCEDURAL BARRIERS TO POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY WITH ME AND SUPPORT. IS JUST APPROVED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVALS READY TO HEAR FROM THE WITNESS. MR BRITTAIN. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIR JONES SAWYER THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU YOU SAID ABOUT LEADING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. FOR SERVING AS A CHAMPION FOR POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. COMMITTEE CHANGE IN THIS CRITICAL AREA- AS WE JUST HEARD- THERE WAS HISTORY MADE IN MANY REGARDS TO DAY IN. MINNEAPOLIS IT FACED THE JUSTICE IN THIS CASE FACED TREMENDOUS HURDLES PROCEDURAL HURDLES POLITICAL HURDLE PRACTICAL HURDLES. AND THE HOUSE EXAM. IN SAN FRANCISCO EXISTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CASH OKAY WHEN THERE ARE ISSUES OF POLICE USE OF FORCE. AND WHEN THE PUBLIC DEMANDS POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. ACTION GREENS FOR NOT TO THE RIGHT AS WE REFLECT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE GEORGE FLOYD CASE AND FOR FAR TOO MANY OTHERS WHO'VE BEEN KILLED THE HANDS OF POLICE. PUBLIC OUTRAGE HAS BEEN CHANNEL. IT FOR GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN THIS UNLAWFUL POLICE VIOLENT. BUT ALL ACCOUNTABILITY HAS SURGED IT REMAINS RARE FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO INITIATE PROSECUTIONS AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS WHO VIOLATE THE LAW WELL IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THIS CASE IN MINNEAPOLIS HAS CAPTURED NATIONAL ATTENTION THE WAY IT HAS TO RARE. BUT THESE KILLINGS OF BLACK MEN IS RARE BUT CRIMINAL CHARGES BEING BROUGHT IS RARE AND ONE OF THE OBSTACLES TO PROSECUTION. OF POLICE OFFICERS IN THESE KINDS OF CASES USING. ELEMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO ASSIST IN THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION. HELLO ONE OF. THIS CAN LEAD TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS REFUSED. TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY QUESTIONS FOR. TECHNIQUES TO SUPPORT AN ARREST WARRANT. AB ONE TWENTY SEVEN. IS A PRACTICAL SIMPLE AND NECESSARY CHANGE. IT'S A COMMON SENSE WAY TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AT A TIME WHEN OUR COUNTRY IS CLEAN HERE AND EVER BEEN ON THE NEED FOR COMPLETE SCALABILITY. CLOSE TO CHANGING THE LAW DOES NOT CHANGE IN ANY WAY DOES NOT CHANGE. BUT THE MAGISTRATE OR JUDGE IT DOES NOT CHANGE IN ANY WAY THE LEGAL STANDARD REQUIRED TO INITIATE A CRIMINAL CASE OR ARREST WARRANTS. THIS CHANGE SIMPLY EXPANDS WHO CAN ATTEST BEFORE JUDGE MAGISTRATE THAT PROBABLE CAUSE EXISTS CORPORATE WHEN THE SUBJECT OF THAT ARREST IS A PEACE OFFICER. IN OTHER WORDS. ELIMINATES DEFECTIVE VETO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE ON THE ABILITY TO DOUBLE CLICK THE ATTORNEYS TO INITIATE. CASES ALLOWING FOR MORE THAN JUST A PEACE OFFICER TO A TEST INTERESTING THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE. IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT CONSTITUENTS WORK PEACE OFFICER IS THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. UNDER THIS LAW AS STATED BY SENATOR CALM WATER. AN EMPLOYEE OF A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR OFFICE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO MAKE SUCH A DECLARATION OF PROBABLE CAUSE TO A JUDGE. THERE WERE NOT STE WE- THE POST CERTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. YEP THERE'S PRECEDENT FROM SEVERAL OTHER STATES FOR THE PROPOSED CHANGE LAW THERE'S NINE OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW PERSONS OTHER THAN A POLICE OFFICER TO ATTEST. AND ALL BECAUSE EXISTS FOR THE REST WERE. THE NINE STATES HAVE SUCH LAWS INCLUDE. IN NORTH CAROLINA SOUTH CAROLINA PENNSYLVANIA MARYLAND OHIO TEXAS VIRGINIA AND GEORGIA. IN SHORT THIS CHANGE IS NECESSARY AND IT'S COMMONSENSE WE'VE SEEN IT WORK IN A JURISDICTIONS IN IT WE SEE THAT IT'S- BUT- EXIST IN CALIFORNIA LAW IF WE COMPARE. WARRANTS TWO SEARCH WARRANTS AND SEARCH WARRANTS ALREADY HAVE SIMILAR PROVISIONS ANY PERSON WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS. TO PRESENT THAT INFORMATION TO A MAGISTRATE. THE REASONS AND FOR THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE NEEDS.

THANK YOU. MR SANTIAGO WHO'S PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF MR BONTA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR BROUGHT I HAVE A TWO BILLS WHAT ONE WHICH I'M ALSO TAKING OVER FOR MR BONTA. THE FIRST BILL IS AB NINE SIXTY THREE MODIFY START THERE SURE OKAY. FIRST MAJESTIC THE COMMITTEE IT WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AB NINE SIXTY WILL CREATE A MEDICAL PAROLE PANEL AT EACH CDCR PRESIDENT EXPLAINS THE CRITERIA FOR MEDICAL PAROLE. AS AMENDED AB NINE SIXTY PROVIDES MEDICAL PAROLE IF THE MEDICAL PAROLE PANEL DETERMINES THAT THE R. COSTA RICA PERSON. NEEDS HOSPICE CARE HAS THE ABILITY TO PAIN OR DEBILITATING DISEASES CHRONOLOGICAL AGE OR COMBINATION OF THESE. FACTORS WHILE WE HAVE OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND INMATES. INSIDE CDCR PRISONS IDENTIFIED AS MEDICALLY HIGH RISK ONLY A FORTY EIGHT PEOPLE WERE RELEASED FOR MEDICAL PAROLE BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. CLEARLY THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS TO GET THROUGH- WE ALSO SPEND A INORDINATE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE INMATES WERE ON MEDICAL PAROLE THERE ARE SOME OF OUR MOST EXPENSIVE INDIVIDUALS TO CARE FOR. US SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND WILL ENSURE THAT. THERE IS A- THE MORE THOUGHTFUL PROCESS AROUND MEDICAL PAROLE NOW HAVING SAID THIS THIS BILL DOES NOT GUARANTEE MEDICAL PAROLE- BUT INSURERS. THAT MEDICAL PAROLE PANEL WILL INCLUDE THE PATIENT'S PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN THE CIVIL SERVICE PSYCHOLOGIST OR SOCIAL WORKER AND THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES- I HAVE TWO WITNESSES- DR RONALD LEWIS AS WELL AS- KELLY SAVAGE RODRIGUEZ. YES WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWED ME THE TIME TO SPEAK QUICKLY ON SUPPORT OF AB NINE SIXTY I'M ALSO VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U. A. P. WHICH IS A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL- MY NAME IS. DR RON LEWIS AND I WAS EMPLOYED BY FIFTY EIGHT THE EIGHTH FOR TEN YEARS THAT ARE WITH STATE PRISONS SOME VERY FAMILIAR. WITH THE- CURRENT PRACTICE OF MEDICAL PAROLE. BUT FIRST CONTROL CURRENT WHO NOT SERVING CARTS RATED PEOPLE IN THE WAY TO JUSTIFY THE INTENDED. THE CONFIGURATION PROCESS IS IN EFFECT IN THE TAKES TAKES FAR TOO LONG AND INVOLVED MULTIPLE STEPS. AND IT SENATORS MAINLY IN THE COUNTRYSIDE OF THAT INSTITUTION RATHER THAN HAVING MORE INVOLVEMENT OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHO UNDERSTAND IMPACT OF THAT PARTICULAR- ELEMENTS ON THE BODY. AB NINE SIXTY WOULD AUTHORIZE. AS CHESTER STATED CREATION OF MEDICAL PAROLE PANEL EACH INSTITUTION CONSISTING OF THE INCARCERATED. PERSONS AIR CARE POSITION BUT SEVERAL THANK HOW FOR EMMA VIEW AND A MEDICAL WERE. OR FOR TO- FROM D. C. R. T. C. A. THE. HELP YOUR BILL YOUR CALL LIMITED AND- BETWEEN- CHEF STATED BETWEEN TO THE SEVENTEEN AND I ARE. EIGHT PEOPLE WERE GRANTED MEDICAL PAROLE EVEN THOUGH. SEVENTEEN THOUSAND ARE TERRIFIED THAT MEDICALLY HIGH RISK. EIGHTY NINE SIXTY WOULD EXPAND THE MEDICAL PAROLE SO BOTH OF THOSE CONSERVE PASTAS CARE AND THOSE ARE EXPERIENCING DELIVER- DEBILITATING PAIN CAN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE AND THERE'S REFERENCES IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THAT OUTLINED- PLEASE OF. AND WHAT CAN- QUALIFY FOR DEBILITATING PAIN- AND HARKLESS CARE AT THIS EARLY INCARCERATED SICK AND ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE COSTLY. WE SPEND EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY TWO THOUSAND EACH INCARCERATED PERSON OF WHICH TWENTY SIX THOUSAND IS SPENT ON USUAL MEDICAL COSTS NOT HIçN BECAUSE WITH THE USUAL DAY TO DAY ROUTINE OF TAKING CARE OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE. IF TWENTY ARE RELEASED UNDER. THE SPELL DURING THE FIRST YEAR. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION COULD BE SAFER CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. THE NUMBER YOU CAN BE HIGHER GIVEN THAT TYPICALLY COST MORE CARE FOR INCARCERATED ELDERLY AND MEDICALLY VULNERABLE PEOPLE. I URGE YOU TO VOTE HI ALL A. B. NINE SIXTY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ALLOW ME TO SPEAK FOR THE FIRT TIME PRESENTER. THANK YOU. MANGAVERSE RODRIGUEZ. ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY MY NAME IS KELLY SAVAGE RODRIGUEZ AND I'M AND FORMER INCARCERATED PERSON AND A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN PRISONERS. I AM PROUD CO SPONSOR OF EIGHTY NINE SIXTY I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A NEW COPY NINE FIFTY BECAUSE IT EXPANDS AND IMPROVES THE MEDICAL PRO PROCESS. MULLIN CHRO SURE DID I VOLUNTEERED MY TIME IN THE NEXT IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY I PROVIDED CARE AND COMFORT TEN PERFORATED INDIVIDUALS AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE- I. PERSONALLY WITNESSED THE FAILURE OF THE PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR MEDICALLY VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE PASSED AWAY IN PERSON. BECAUSE THE CAN. PROCESS IS UNNECESSARILY LENGTHY AND IT REQUIRES THE APPROVAL OF TOO MANY DEPARTMENTS THAT DON'T HAVE THE MEDICAL EXPERTISE. I KNOW THAT AND- THERE ARE MANY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO STRUGGLE WITH DAILY TASKS. FOR EXAMPLE AS BRUSHING THEIR HAIR MAKING CUPS OF COFFEE MOVING AROUND IN THEIR WHEELCHAIRS- WALKERS CANES WHATEVER IT MAY BE. THINK ABOUT TIMES WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO- SEND A LETTER OR AN EMAIL TO SOMEONE AND SOMETHING SO BASIC AND PERSONAL CANNOT BE DONE ON YOUR OWN IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THINK OF THOSE LITTLE. THINGS THAT AFFECT OUR DAILY LIVES AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH AND FIVE ON A DAILY BASIS WHO CAN'T GET THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED. MANY WHO ARE AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE. I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT WE HAVE LOST. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE VALUABLE HUMAN BEINGS TO THE COVER NINETY- COMMITTEE. AT THE DAMAGE AND- THE STATE HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THOSE PEOPLE I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES FOR AB NINE SIXTY BECAUSE THE CURRENT MEDICAL PRO PROCESS IS BROKEN IT IT LACKS TRANSPARENCY IT D. PRIORITIZES THE EXPERTISE OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IT'S HARD TO ELIMINATE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE RELIEF FROM MEDICAL VIABLE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE TREATMENT IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER SURROUNDED BY INDIVIDUALS THAT CARE ABOUT THEM.

THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THAT INCARCERATED PERSON- OKAY ROOMS ARTHRITIS BUT IF THAT ARE TOWARDS KIDS TO THE POINT WHERE THE ADL'S THE- OR IMPACTED THEN I WOULDN'T- THAT DEVOTE PAYING ARE INCAPACITATING.

WHILE MEET YOU CAN ADD- BUT STILL SEEMS QUITE THEY ARE. IT'S GOING TO REMAIN VAGUE- YEAH WELL ON THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH SAFETY CO THERE ALSO OUTLINED SOME OF THESE- SITUATIONS AND I THINK THE BILL REFERENCES THAT SO- BUT I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS TO FINE TUNE- YOUR CONCERN.

PHYSICIAN MONITORING AND SPEARHEADING CONSULTATION- FOR THAT INCARCERATED PERSON RIGHT NOW I THINK THERE'S ONLY SEVEN THERE EIGHT OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THERE WOULD NEED TO BE MORE AND THEY WOULD NEED TO BE STAFFED APPROPRIATELY TO DEAL WITH THOSE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT FOR HER HEART WOULD THEN GO TO A BORN CARE FOR- END OF LIFE- CARE- THANK IS THAT HOLDEN. THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THANK YOU. WELCOME I'M NOT I WOULD JUST ADDS THAT SPECIFICALLY THAT- DID THIS COULD BE POTENTIALLY IF THERE WERE MORE.

IF THE INDIVIDUAL WAS PROLIFIC ALSO GO ON TO. MEDICARE SO IT ACTUALLY WOULD SAY THE STATE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MONEY TO BE ON HEALTHCARE AND BECAUSE THEY- YEAH I DOES THE ASSUMPTION WOULD BE THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FUNCTION WITHOUT MEDICAL CARE.

WE'RE WE'RE WAITING FOR ANOTHER PRESENTER FROM THE ASSEMBLY. WHILE WE WAIT FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO- TO COME TO PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WILL ALLOW ALLOW AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT MISTER LEE SUPERVISED PERSONS RELEASE- MAKE A PRESENTATION.ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY TEAM ON OUR LANGUAGE AND GLADLY ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE OF THEM IT'S PRESENTED TODAY ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A PROCEDURE TO RELEASE INDIVIDUALS FROM DETENTION THAT ONLY FACE A VIOLATION OF PROBATION. TYPICALLY WHEN YOU ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH A CRIME YOU'RE ENTITLED TO SOME FORM OF PRE TRIAL RELEASE HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE CASE WHEN IT COMES INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED FOR A PROBATION VIOLATION OF THE BILL THANK YOU AS NOTED IN ALICE'S EXISTING LAWS NOT CLEAR ON WHETHER OR NOT A PERSON IS DETAINED FOLLOWING ALLEGATION OF VIOLATING THEIR PROBATION HAS A RIGHT TO BAIL AND OPTIONS FOR LEASE OR NOT DESCRIBED PROBATION CURRENTLY OPERATES UNDER A SEPARATE LEGAL SYSTEM ONE WHERE BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS LIKE THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BE DETENTION HEARINGS AND BURDEN OF PROOF. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT ARE DISREGARDED THIS BILL SIX ADDRESSED THE ISSUE BY DIRECTING THE COURT TO RELEASE PEOPLE DETAINED ON A VIOLATION OF THE PROBATION UNLESS THEY FIND THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD POSE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY ORDER TURN INTO THEIR FLIGHT RISK. AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE MOST RECENT HUMPHREY'S DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT IN STATES THAT IF BAIL IS SET. IT MUST BE SET AT A LEVEL PERSON CAN REASONABLY AFFORD WE MUST UPHOLD ALL CORNERSTONES OF A SUPPLY SYSTEM OF JUSTICE INCLUDING ECONOMIC JUSTICE. KEEPING SOMEONE DETAINED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ECONOMIC MEANS TO BE RELEASED IS DISCRIMINATORY. SUSTAINS A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT BENEFITS THE WEALTHY WHILE MARGINALIZING THE POOR. PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCUSED OF WRONGDOING SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THE OPTION TO CONTINUE THEIR LIVES OUTSIDE DETENTION UNTIL COURT CAN APPROPRIATELY DETERMINE WHETHER VIOLATIONS OCCURRED. AND WHAT IF ANY ADDITIONAL PROBATION TERMS ARE NECESSARY SO I ASK THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT ME. I SUPPORT THIS RESORT FORM TO UPHOLD THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH IS THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESSES SUPPORT DAVID BRIGGS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE THANK YOU. YOU MAY BEGIN MISTER BRIGGS WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON- YES MY NAME IS DAVID BRIGGS AND I'M THE CO CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE HI WE ARE A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL- I'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAW FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS NOW AND ALMOST ALL OF THAT DO IN CRIMINAL DEFENSE WORK- AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT. WOULD MAKE MUCH NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WAY CALIFORNIA COURTS HANDLE ALLEGATIONS THAT A PERSON HAS VIOLATED PROBATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT PROBATIONERS ARE PEOPLE A JUDGE HAS DETERMINED DESERVE TO BE RELEASED INTO SOCIETY DESPITE HAVING COMMITTED A CRIME. GENERALLY THE CRIMES INVOLVED- ARE MISDEMEANORS AND- FELONS. PROBATION IMPOSES CONDITIONS INTENDED TO REHABILITATE THE PROBATIONER SUCH AS DRUG TESTING FAMILY COUNSELING AND REPORTING TO A PROBATION OFFICER. HOWEVER OF PROBATIONERS LIFE CAN BE DIFFICULT AND PROBATIONERS NOT INFREQUENTLY VIOLATE THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR PROBATION. VIOLATIONS CAN BE RELATIVELY MINOR SUCH AS MISSING A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT WITH THE PROBATION OFFICER OR THEY CAN BE SEVERE SUCH AS COMMISSION OF A NEW CRIME. AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT DOES NOT DEAL WITH NEW CARS IN WHICH THERE'S A RIGHT TO SPEEDY TRIAL BY A JURY. AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT ADDRESSES PROBATION VIOLATIONS WERE THERE'S NO RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. NICK IS A BOILING PROVISION CAN CONTEST THE CHARGE ONLY IN A NON JURY HEARING. AND THERE'S NO FIRM LIMóN ON HOW LONG THE PERSON MOSTLY FROM THE STEERING. CURRENTLY NO BAIL PROBATION HOLDS ARE THE STANDARD PROCEDURE BECAUSE SO MANY CASES IN COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND ARE COMMON IN MISDEMEANOR CASES ALSO. PLEASE NOTE BILL HOLDS FORCED PROBATIONERS INTO JAIL FOR WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS ON UNPROVED CHARGES. THEY FAIL TO CONSIDER THE DEGREE TO WHICH INCARCERATION WILL INTERFERE WITH THE WITH THE PROBATIONERS REHABILITATION. AND A TECHNO CAL THE SEVERITY OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATION. SO AB TWO ALTERNATE WOULD REPLACE THE SYSTEM WITH WILL FUND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE MENTION THAT IS BECAUSE BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT'S RECENT DECISION IN. IN RE HOME CORRECT. IT WOULD BE IN MOST CASES IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT IF ANY BILL'S GOING TO BE SET IF YOU SET AN AMOUNT THE PROBATIONER CAN REASONABLY AFFORD. I THOUGHT IT WOULD REQUIRE JUDGES PROBATION OUT OF GUILT FOR THE HEARING. UNLESS JAIL THE ONLY MEASURE WHICH WOULD REASONABLY PROTECT PUBLIC AND REASONABLE YOU'RE SURE OF THE PERSON'S APPEARANCE IN COURT. SO AB TO OPEN IT WOULD KEEP REPLACEMENT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES WORKING AT THEIR JOBS AND PARTICIPATING IN THE DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS. START URGE YOU TO FOR THE REHABILITATION OF PROBATIONERS BY HOLDING ON. ON AB TWELVE TWENTY.

I AM I PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR WHICH IS A COMMONSENSE EFFORT TO BRING MORE TRANSPARENCY TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND TO ENSURE THE TAXPAYER RESOURCES ARE SPENT A MANNER THAT SURELY ADVANCES JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE WELL AWARE IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA'S IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF NOTABLE REFORM STAR CRIMINAL AND JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS. THESE REFORMS HAVE AIMED TO REDUCE MASS INCARCERATION PROMOTE PATHWAYS TO REHABILITATION AND MORE EFFECTIVELY ADVANCED PUBLIC SAFETY. DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THESE REFORMS CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD THE NATION IN SPENDING ON CORRECTIONS OVER THE PAST DECADE CDC ARE SPENDING HAS INCREASED BY OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT. AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY SPENDS MORE ON CORRECTIONS THAN TEXAS AND NEW YORK COMBINED. EXCESSIVE SPENDING ON CORRECTIONS HAS RESULTED IN DIMINISHED REVENUES FOR OTHER PUBLIC POLICY PRIORITIES. INCLUDING EDUCATION HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR BUILT ON BIPARTISAN MOMENTUM TO PROMOTE FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND CALIFORNIA'S FAILED EXPERIMENT WITH MASS INCARCERATION. MODELED AFTER SUCCESSFUL PROTOCOLS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN PHILADELPHIA NORTHERN VIRGINIA AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL BRING ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY TO THE SENTENCING PROCESS AND INCENTIVIZE PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES TO CONSIDER THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ADVANCE JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. TO BE CLEAR EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR DOES NOT IMPOSE ANY REAL BURDEN ON PROSECUTORS RATHER IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THEM TO TAKE THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COST OF INCARCERATION OR SUPERVISION. WHICH WILL BE TABULATED AND REPORTED BY THE ALEJO FOR THE B. SEC AND MULTIPLY THAT BY THE LENGTH OF THE SENTENCE THEY'RE RECOMMENDING. JUDGES WILL THEN HAVE THE OPTION AT THEIR DISCRETION TO CONSIDER THIS INFORMATION IN THE MANNER THEY BELIEVE IS MOST APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL DOES NOT DIMINISH OTHER APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE CRIMES THE MOTHER RATHER MERELY ADD TO ONE ADDITIONAL DATA POINT FOR THE JUDGE TO CONSIDER. IF THEY SO DESIRE. IN SO DOING AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY INTO THE SENTENCING PROCESS. AND INCENTIVIZE PROSECUTORS TO ENSURE THE TAXPAYER RESOURCES ARE SPENT WISELY. AND IN A MANNER THAT TRULY ADVANCES JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. HERE WITH ME TODAY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT HE BILL IN THE SENTENCING PROCESS IS CRIMINAL ATTORNEY IN COUNCIL FOR RESTORE JUSTICE LES GILLIS THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.

SACRAMENTO COUNTY HOPEFULLY I PRONOUNCED IT CORRECTLY. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SMALL GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY HI MY NAME IS JANE VALLEJO FROM THE SACRAMENTO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND THE VOICES FOR VICTIMS COALITION WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR MONEY SHOULD NOT HAVE A PLACE IN DECISIONS ABOUT PUNISHMENT AND JUSTICE. CHOOSING A CONSTANT SHOULD ONLY INVOLVE WEIGHT WEIGHING THE SPECIFIC SITUATION AND NEEDS OF THE OFFENDER AND THE VICTIM CARE RESPECTIVE OF BUDGETARY CONCERNS. PRESSURE TO SAVE MONEY FOR TAXPAYERS COULD SKEW JUDICIAL OPENINGS ASKING JUDGES TO MAKE BUDGETARY DECISIONS DOES NOT BELONG IN THE COURTROOM. JUSTICE ISN'T SUBJECT TO A MATHEMATICAL FOMULA. IF WE ARE GOING TO PUT ON THE RECORD THE COSTS OF INCARCERATION THEN WE SHOULD ALSO PUT ON THE RECORD THE COST OF THE CRYING TO THE VICTIM ACOSTA COUNSELLING FOR RAPE VICTIM. LOTS OF WAGES FOR MOTHER ATTENDING COURT TO MAKE SURE HER SON WHO WAS MURDERED RECEIVE JUSTICE THE COST TO BUSINESSES FOR ROBBERIES AND THAT. DOES JUSTICE COURT DOES A ONCE WROTE DUE PROCESS IS THE RIGHT OF BOTH THE ACCUSED AND THE ACCUSER. WE ARE YOU TO VOTE NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM FORTY TWO- TO SEE NONE ARE ANY WITNESSES ON THE TELEPHONE LINE TO AB. FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR GABRIEL. THANK YOU IF AN OPPOSITE OF EIGHT PORT THIRTY YEAR PRESS ONE AT THEN THERE. ONE AND THEN ZERO IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEN NONE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST WANTED TO- JUST WANTED TO RESPOND IF I MIGHT TO US SOME OF THE SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW IN NO WAY IS THIS BILL MEANT TO DIMINISH THE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS ALREADY ALREADY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THEIR SPECIFIC WAYS THAT ALL THOSE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE AND THE VICTIM OF THE IMPACT ON THE VICTIM OF APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATIONS. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PARTY AT PLAY HERE IF THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE VICTIM AND THE PERPETRATOR THIS IS ALSO ABOUT SOCIETY. AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE BRING A CHARGE AGAINST SOMEBODY. IT'S NOT THE NAME OF THE VICTIM BRINGING THE CHARGE THE ATTORNEY WHO STANDS UP THE PROSECUTORS REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THAT IS ANOTHER APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION HERE. I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS BIPARTISAN MOMENTUM AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THAT'S WHY YOU'VE SEEN. REPUBLICAN SOUTHERN GOVERNORS AND THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION AND NEWT GINGRICH AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT HAVE GOTTEN ON BOARD AND SAID. WE ARE WASTING MONEY WITH MASS INCARCERATION. NOT ONLY ARE THEIR HUMAN LIFE AT STAKE HUMAN BEINGS ARE CAPABLE OF REDEMPTION. BUT WE ARE THROWING MONEY. DOWN THE DRAIN TAXPAYER MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN. WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT IN TERMS OF JUSTICE AND NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY. I KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY THEY WORK HARD. AND THEY EXPECT US WHEN THEY PAY TAXES TO SPEND THEIR MONEY OFFICIALLY. AND THEY DON'T CARE IF WHATEVER ENTITY OF GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT'S THE DMV OR THE DA. SHOULD GET A BLANK CHECK. WE ARE NOT PUTTING ANY LIMITATIONS ON ANYBODY. WE ARE SIMPLY SAYING. LISTLESS AND THE JUDGE CAN CONSIDER IT IF AND HOW THEY WANT TO AND I THINK. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE PROSECUTOR WHO SPOKE FROM THE DA. WE HAVE TO TRUST OUR JUDGES. THE JUDGES ALREADY IN STRUCTURE IS AND WHAT THEY SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT CONSIDER. WE ARE SIMPLY SAYING TO THEM. IF THERE'S A SAME WAY TO ADVANCE PUBLIC SAFETY INTO CHIEF JUSTICE BUT DO IT IN A WAY THAT CONSERVES. SCARCE TAXPAYER RESOURCES. LET'S THINK ABOUT DOING THAT. SO WITH THAT. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU- J. RECOMMEND I VOTE. CALL THE ROLL.

CREATE A PROCESS FOR RECONSIDERATION OF A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE FINDING WHERE RELEVANT FACTORS CAN BE CONSIDERED INCLUDING FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE NOT.

AMONG OTHER FACTORS THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR THE PERSON'S AGE AT THE TIME OF THE OFFENSE AND WHETHER THE PERSON WAS THE VICTIM OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. OR SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND IT'S PROFOUND AFFECT ON THEM. IN ADDITION THE BILL ESTABLISHES A PRESUMPTION THAT THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE FINDING SHOULD BE DISMISSED WHERE A PERSON HAS SERVE MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE CRIME. WITHOUT COMMITTING OR ATTEMPTING TO COMMIT AN ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST ANY OTHER PERSON. CALIFORNIA LAW PROHIBITS A JUDGE FROM STRIKING A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE FUNDING THAT SENSES A PERSON. TO DEATH OR LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE ITSELF A DEATH SENTENCE. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE IN THE COURT UNDER CURRENT LAW HAS NO POWER TO DISMISS THIS FINDING ONCE MADE. NOT EVEN FOR YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES. BETWEEN THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD OR FOR A PERSON WHO IS SUFFERING. A TERMINAL ILLNESS. THE FINDING OF A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE HAS BEEN FRAUGHT WITH RACIAL BIAS AND HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY USED AGAINST BLACK AND LATINO CALIFORNIANS THE DEFENDANTS.OF THE COMBINED FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA SENSE EITHER LIFE. WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE OR TO DEATH 35% ARE BLACK. AND THIRTY THREE POINT 4% ARE HISPANIC COMPARED TO ONLY TWENTY TWO PERCENT. THAT ARE WHITE UNTIL THE DEATH PENALTY IS ELIMINATED AB TWELVE TWENTY FOUR WILL GIVE COURTS DISCRETION TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW. SAVING TAXPAYERS BILLIONS. AND ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMIC RACIAL BIAS THAT HAS HARMED THE INTEGRITY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. FOR GENERATIONS. AB TWELVE TWENTY FOUR WILL ALSO ALLOW COURTS TO CONSIDER WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL'S PERFORMANCE BEHAVIOR GROWTH MATURITY AND OTHER FACTORS ARISING AFTER THEIR CONVICTION. OF SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE MURDER DEMONSTRATES THAT THEY ARE NOT HOPELESSLY INCORRIGIBLE. AND THEY SHOULD BE EVALUATED BY THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS CONCERNING THEIR POTENTIAL SUITABILITY SUITABILITY FOR PAROLE. IF A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCESDISMISSED THE PERSONAL BE ELIGIBLE TO BE EVALUATED FOR PAROLE LIKE ANY OTHER PERSON SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. AFTER A MINIMUM OF A TWENTY FIVE YEAR SENTENCE IF NOT SUBSTANTIALLY LONGER DEPENDING ON THE CRIME. OR PREVIOUS STRIKES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

THREE QUARTERS OF THEM COMMITTED THEIR CRIMES IN THEIR TWENTIES OR YOUNGER. THEY MUST DIE IN PRISON BECAUSE THEIR MURDER CONVICTIONS INCLUDE A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM NEVER KILLED ANYONE AND NEVER WANTED ANYONE TO BE KILLED. SB THIRTY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE RELATIVELY NEW LEGAL PHENOMENON. THEY NEVER EXISTED UNTIL THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND WE ARE STILL LEARNING ABOUT THEIR IMPACT. THE LAW REQUIRES THESE INDIVIDUALS TO DIE IN PRISON BECAUSE THE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY COURT TO ANSWER DISMISS CERTAIN. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PERSON HAS BEEN REHABILITATED HAD MATURED AND GROWN INTO A DIFFERENT PERSON OR HAVE AFFIRMATIVELY MADE IMPORTANT AND POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OTHERS. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE JUDGE THE PROSECUTOR OR THE VICTIM'S FAMILY NO LONGER BELIEVES THEY SHOULD DIE IN PRISON. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT WHEN THE COURTS REQUIRE A PERSON TO DIE IN PRISON IN THE COURTS MUST BE ABLE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEIR LIFE AFTER CONVICTION AND TALK TO THEIR BACKGROUND THE COURT NEVER KNEW ABOUT. SHOW THAT THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE DISMISSED. THIS BILL WOULD NEVER REQUIRE ANYONE TO BE RELEASED IT WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW WITH THE COURT TO CONSIDER DISMISSING A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE. AND IF THE COURT DID SO THAT WOULD MERELY ALLOW THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL WAS SUITABLE FOR PAROLE AFTER SERVING A MINIMUM TERM OF AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS FOR MUCH LONGER. IF THE PERSON HAD PRIOR STRIKE CONVICTIONS WERE USED A GUN DURING THE CRIME. WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF AB TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE IT IS ONLY FAIR TO ALLOW THE COURTS TO CONSIDER THE FULL PICTURE OF A PERSON'S ENTIRE LIFE. BEFORE REQUIRING THAT PERSON TO DIE IN PRISON. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS. FISHERMEN MEMBERS DAMSELS AUTO ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. AS WE AUTHORED MY COLLEAGUES STATED. WHEN A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOUND THROUGH THE COURT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO DISCRETION TO DISMISS THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE COURT TO EITHER IMPOSE A SENTENCE OF DEATH OR LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. THIS IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH A GREAT NUMBER OF THESE DEFENDANTS ARE STILL MINORS- AT THE TIME OF THEIR CONVICTION. BOTH THE COURT AND THE MEDICAL EXPERTS HAVE ALL FOUND THAT. MINORS PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE HOW. VERY DIFFERENT BRAIN ASSIST THEM ADULT. CHILDREN MINERS HAVE A LACK MATURITY AND AN UNDEVELOPED STE UNDERDEVELOPED SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY THIS LACK OF MATURITY BLACK LEADS THESE MINORS TO ENGAGE IN MORE RECKLESS IMPULSIVE AND HEEDLESS RISK TAKING PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO COMMITTING CRIMES. THERE BEEN MANY EXAMPLES OF INDIVIDUALS SENTENCED TO L. WALLOP. WHO HAVE SPENT DECADES IN PRISON AS MODEL PRISONERS COMMITTED NO ACTS OF VIOLENCE HAVING NO DISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS. THE COURT SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONSIDER ALL OF THE FACTORS BEFORE AN INDIVIDUAL IS OBVIOUSLY PUT TO DEATH OR IS FORCED TO SPEND THE REST OF THEIR NATURAL LIFE IN PRISON. THE COURT ISSUES ITS SENTENCE IT IS DOING SO BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF THE KNOWLEDGE IT HAS AT THE TIME HOWEVER TWENTY YEARS TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER. THERE IS MUCH MORE ABOUT THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT. COULD CROP SKEWS ME COULD BE POSSIBLY RELATED TO WHETHER OR NOT. SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE. WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. INDIVIDUALS DO CHANGE THAT'S WHY CDCR IS ALL IS NOT ONLY THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTION BUT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AS WAS STATED NOTHING IN AB TOLD TWENTY FOUR WILL EVER REALLY RESULT IN A DIRECT RELIEF OF AN INMATE WILL SIMPLY MAKE INMATES. ELIGIBLE FOR A PAROLE HEARING AFTER SERVING AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN STATE PRISON. FOR THESE REASONS OUR OFFICE IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU.

CONVICTED BY A JUDGE AND A JURY OR DEATH BY LETHAL INJECTION AND- HE WAS ON A MURDEROUS SHOOTING SPREE THAT EVENING- CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST PEOPLE SUCH AS THAT- SHOULD NOT EVEN BE ENTERTAINED TO.

MURDER SHOOTING SPREE HE HAPPENED UPON US MY HUSBAND WAS- FROM THE LAST WORDS I HEARD HIM SAY WITH HONEY THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT YEAR AND TWO HOURS LATER. HE WAS DEAD. DID IT BECAUSE SOMEONE.

THANK YOU WE HAVE NO MORE OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. K. ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MR LACKEY. YEAH I DON'T REALLY HAVE A QUESTION I JUST HAVE A COMMENT THAT. I FIND THIS BILL ALARMING. AND ACTUALLY SHOCKING THAT HOW DISMISSES VICTIMS SUFFERING. THESE ARE OVERTLY BRUTAL MURDERS QUALIFY FOR SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS THE WORST OF THE WORST. BUT YET. WE'RE FINDING A WAY. TO- FORGET DEGREE JUST NATURE BY WHICH PEOPLE HAVE DIED THIS IS DEATH. THIS IS VERY FINAL THEY DON'T GET REHABILITATED. THEY DON'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THEIR FAMILY TO WALK FREELY. WHILE I'M UNFORTUNATELY GOING TO POST THIS STRONGLY. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY MR QUIRK- SO OFTEN WHAT SEASON BEEN MOVED YEAH YEAH- THE CONCERN I HAVE IS WHEN YOU MAKE IT AUTOMATIC IN THE FACT. AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET TWO THIRDS VOTE ON THE FLOOR WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DO THIS I THINK IT TO A- I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO RECONSIDER THAT- FOR. IT JUST THERE HAS TO BE SOME DISCRETION HERE. THANK YOU. YEAH I THINK THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK IN AND CAUGHT A PASSION FROM SOME NUMBER LACK YEARS WELL- I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR FOR. FOR YOU IS AS VOTING MEMBERS BUT ALSO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OBSERVING THE WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE. NOTHING HERE IS AUTOMATIC NOTHING AND- WHAT THIS DOES MERELY. IS ALLOWING THE COURT TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY. OF- OF DISMISSING THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT'S ALL IT IS- THAT'S NOT OUR REGION TO BE HELD OKAY I MEAN IT SAYS- YOU KNOW IT SHALL BE PRESUMED TO SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES FINDING WILL BE DISMISSED. AND IT GOES TO THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS. UNLESS THE PROSECUTION DEMONSTRATES BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THE DEFENDANT WILL COMMIT A FUTURE FILE IN FACT IMMEDIATE SALAS AUTOMATIC YEAH I'M NOT A LAWYER. THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN THANK YOU OKAY SO. IT WHERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I THINK IF YOU CLARIFY THAT YEAH I THINK THERE WILL AT LEAST HELP MR QUIRK DID YOU HAVE ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY. COMMENT YES MISTER. OUR RECORD OUR K. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I HAVE TO SAY THAT I CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUE MISTER KIRK WHICH IS- I MEAN I DO BELIEVE THAT GIVING JUDICIAL DESTRUCTION TO DECIDE WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IS WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY ROOMS AND WHEN IT COMES TO SENTENCING AND SAID THAT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH I DON'T KNOW WHY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DIFFERENCE AND THAT THE JUDGE WE CAN TRUST JUDGES EVERY DAY TO DECIDE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCES. BUT I AGREE WITH MR QUIRK THAT THE SECTION THAT TALKS ABOUT IF THE OFFENSE WAS COMMITTED TWENTY YEARS OR MORE BEFORE THERE'S BEEN NO ACTIVE ISLANDS AND THERE ISN'T A DEFINITION OF ACTIVE VIOLENCE EITHER WHICH I THINK LEAVES A FAIRLY VAGUE CIRCUMSTANCES SAYS IT SHALL BE PRESUMED AND THE FINDING WILL BE DISMISSED SO I DON'T THINK THAT LEAVES DISCRETION TO THE COURT TO DISMISS THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK THAT'S- PROBLEMATIC. SO I DON'T I MEAN I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT LEAST- FOR ME TO SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HOPE FOR MISSION AS IF IT'S- THERE ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. YOU MAY CLOSE YEAH I THINK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR EXPRESSING THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE AS WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO. ON FIGURE OUT HOW TO SERVE JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS A QUITE A DAY AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO PURSUE JUSTICE. AND I DON'T THINK IT EVERYONE CAN COME TO THEIR CONCLUSION WHEREVER THEY ARE. HOWEVER THEY GET TO THAT. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL FINE LINE AND WE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS BEING CLOSE YOU CAN CROSS THAT LINE IT'S REALLY FINE I DON'T THINK THERE IS A LINE HERE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT REASONABLE PEOPLE WANT TO DO AND HOW REGIONAL PEOPLE CREATE POLICY PARTICULARLY HERE IN THIS VERY SENSITIVE DELICATE AREA. WHERE STOCK SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES- HERE ARE OUR APPLY TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T ACTUALLY COMMIT THE MURDER. BUT THEY CAN BE FOUND UPON PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN IN THAT CRIME THEY DIDN'T COMMIT THE MURDER ITSELF AND- YOUR OF COURSE MY HEART IS- FOR VICTIMS- IT'S WE WANT JUSTICE. AND HERE WE ALSO WANT. REHABILITATION AND THIRTY YEARS AGO. REASONABLE PEOPLE. I FELT LIKE YOU CAN LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY A PARTICULAR AS YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY LOOK LIKE THERE IS A RACIAL LENS THAT IS APPLIED AND WE KNOW THAT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO DATA TELLS US THAT WE JUST READ THE WORDS. AND YOU CAN KNOW THAT- THERE IT THERE'S A NET THIS IS THE TYPE OF PERSON ARE GONNA CATCH AND THAT'S NOT BUT IF YOULOOK A DIFFERENT WAY. YOU YOU MIGHT NOT. GET CAUGHT. THIRTY YEARS LATER IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A FINE LINE IS JUST REGIONAL PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT THIS AND SAY WE DID NOT APPLY THIS IN A WAY THAT TRULY PURSUES JUSTICE. AND RECOGNIZING WHAT JUSTICE CAN BE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. THAT IT'S MORE OF A- YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU SHARE. A LOT LINE WITH THE NEIGHBOR AND THE FENCES AND RIGHT ON THAT LINE AND YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE BETWEEN YOUR HOUSES YOU'RE CROSSING IT ALL THE TIME. AND THIS IS WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES TODAY REALIZING THAT THIRTY YEARS AGO. WE CROSSED IT IN A WAY. THAT HAS HARMED A SIGNIFICANT POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT JUST. AND SO TODAY I ASK YOU. A TO PURSUE JUSTICE THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. TWO I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THE CONCERT AND HOPEFULLY- FORGET THIS BILL OUT HERE TODAY THAT YOU WILL COMMIT. TO POLICE TO COUPLE THE MEMBERS ON HERE THAT TO CLARIFY THAT- IS NOT AUTOMATIC- IF I KNOW IT I KNOW. I KNOW THIS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. DOES NOT **** NILLY LET ANYONE OUT IT IS VERY. VERY CHALLENGING- ESPECIALLY COMMITTED A HEINOUS CRIME IS VERY CHALLENGING IN A LOT OF HOOPS YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT IS A LOT OF STEPS YOU HAVE TO GO TO. BEFORE THEY RECONSIDER- ANY VIOLATION MUCH LESS THAN THE MOST HEINOUS. ESPECIALLY ONES WHICH TORE FAMILIES APART AND VICTIMS OF REALLY REALLY. STILL HURTING- DECADES LIKE I COMMITTED THAT MISTER CHAIR AND% I THINK THAT ANY PROCESS NEEDS TO TAKE A LOT OF THINGS IN THE CONSIDERATION THAT NO TWO CASES- IS LOOK AT THE SAME WAY. I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU FROM WHERE YOU'RE GOING YEAH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT- OF. WE CAN AT LEAST AGREE ON ON ON THAT AND WE CAN HOPEFULLY MOVE FORWARDJEFF RECOMMENDED I ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

WHEN I TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND DECIDE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BILL YOU I THOUGHT ABOUT FAMILY MEMBERS. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THE IMPACT ON FAMILIES.

AND AT THAT TIME THERE WERE VISIT FOUR DAYS A WEEK AND MY DAD WOULD BRING ALBANY ON THURSDAY EVENING. BECAUSE THE AVAILABILITY OF FOR VISITING DAYS I WASABLE TO HAVE A REAL RAW AND HONEST CONVERSATIONS WITH MY CHILD. IT'S FAITH TO OUR LIVES AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS. HAVING MORE VISITING DAYS AVAILABLE ALL VISITS WERE MORE GRANDPARENT AND CHILD CENTERED BECAUSE THERE WERE LESS PEOPLE VISITING LESS CROWDING MORE SPACE. MORE CHILDREN'S BOOKS TO READ AVAILABLE AND JUST MORE BREEDING BROWN SHOULD JUST BE A CHILD IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT. WHEN VISITS WERE CUT TO VISITING PER WEEK THAT'S WHEN VISITS BEGAN TO GET TERMINATED DUE TO OVERCROWDING AND A LOT OF FAMILY SUFFERED BECAUSE OF THAT. IN CARBURETION ALREADY SEPARATE FAMILY AT THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSON I KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO STICK WITH YOUR MISTAKES AND POOR CHOICES AND WANT SOMETHING BETTER WANT TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY WHAT THE MAKE A MAN. VISITS EXIST TO BRING HEALING TO OUR FAMILIES TO DISRUPT THE INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA WE NEED MORE ACCESS TO THEM. MY SON GROW UP IN THE VISITING ROOM WITH OUR COMMUNITY OF INCARCERATED WOMEN THAT HE GREW TO LOVE AND CHERISH. WE WITNESSED A LOT OF UNFAIRNESS WHILE THEIR PEOPLE BEING DENIED THE VISIT FOR NEGLECTING SOMETHING ON THEIR APPLICATION FOR WEARING A FLOWERED SHIRT AND BEING TOLD THERE WAS TOO MUCH GREEN IN THE LEAVES GREEN BEING AT THE FALLOUT COLOR FOR VISITORS TO WEAR. WHEN I CALLED MY SON WAS ATSEVENTEEN AND A HALF ALREADY ENLISTED IN BOOT CAMP. AND WE WEREN'T REUNITED UNTIL HE RETURNED FROM A TOUR IN AFGHANISTAN. HE CAME BACK WITH A PURPLE HEART AND LEFT THE MILITARY AS A SERGEANT AT NINETEEN YEARS OLD. TODAY HE IS ATTENDING SMU IN DALLAS TEXAS. MY ENTIRE INCARCERATION THE ONE THING I WORKED HARD AT THESE VISIT WHAT THE HOPE THAT ONE DAY MY SON WOULD GROW UP TO BE A GOOD MAN.

AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER- OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WE NOW BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE YOU HAVE ANY ANY QUESTIONS. MR QUIRK. SO GOOD BIT OF THE OPPOSITION TALKS ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY BONTA FIGHTING YOUR BILL OF SUCH AS GOING TO FOUR DAYS A WEEK RATHER THAN SEVEN ARE NOT LISTED EXPLICIT HOURS AND ALSO ALLOWING FOR- MORE DISCRETION I BELIEVE ON THE PART OF- THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS IN. THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THEY'VE WORKED- DENY- VISITATION CETACEAN YES SOMETIMES THE WORDS DON'T COME WOULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT A BIT MORE YEAH I KNOW AND I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP BECAUSE I DID NOTICE THAT AS WELL WE'RE NOT PRESCRIBING WHAT HOURS WERE IN THE WORD NOT DESCRIBING WHAT DAYS WERE SAYING- FOUR DAYS I THE ISSUE OF COST WAS BROUGHT UP AS WELL SO TO GO TO PUT ON THE TABLE BUT WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING COST AND IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE WOULD WHICH WILL DEAL WITH- DOWN THE LINE. SO BUT BUT TO YOUR POINT- SOME OF THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED THANKS TO THE WORK THAT THE CHAIR HAD- AND COMMITTEE STAFF AND HELPED US TO- TO OVERCOME BUT I CAN'T STAY IN THE CAN'T STATE ENOUGH THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY OUTSIDE OF SATURDAY AND SUNDAY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE. WELL SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO VISIT SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP AND I APPRECIATE OKAY WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF DISCRETION BY THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. IN DENYING IT- AGAIN THE UP. THE SAME YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT I THINK YOU DO BUT- WE'RE JUST ON A DRESS THAT LOOKS. THE ISSUE OF DENYING- VISITATION RIGHTS WOULD BE LIMITED AS I UNDERSTAND IT TO THE COMMITTEES MAMMOTH THE- IF CERTAIN- IF RULES ARE BROKEN DURING THOSE PARTICULAR VISITATION RIGHT- DURING THE VISIT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS YOU JUST CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THOSE- OUTSIDE OF THE VISITATION SO LET'S SAY- YOU AND I ARE VISITING SOMEBODY OR VISITING OURSELVES ONE OF US- IS INCARCERATED IF WE DO SOMETHING TO VIOLATE THE RULES OF THAT. PARTICULAR VISITATION AND THEN SIR THEY'RE DISTRIBUTED DISCUSSION THERE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT- BECAUSE I HAVE MORE THAN FIVE DOLLARS IN MY POCKET. AT ANY GIVEN TIME- WHILE I AM EXERCISING OR DOING SOMETHING ELSE. THAT WOULD BE TAKEN OFF LIMITS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL VISITATION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF VISITATION- AND I THINK THAT'S WERE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DRAW ON THE LINE AND IN REGARDS THIS CONVERSATION TODAY. THANK YOU THAT'S VERY HELPFUL- HAS THE BILL HAS A BEEN A MOTION. RIGHT NOW MOVES TO BAIL AND ASKED TO BE ADDED TO SCOTT WALKER WITH MY PLEASURE. THANK YOU YES. MISS BAR K. Q. Q. WITH THE SENATE YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I THINK THIS REALLY AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THIS HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT I DO THINK THEY TOUCH ON PUBLIC SAFETY I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HERE'S REALLY CRITICAL I MEAN ALL THE DATA IT'S OVERWHELMING TO SHOW THAT ALLOWING ACCESS TO ONE'S FAMILY IN VISITATION IMPROVES OUTCOMES WHEN PEOPLE COME OUT OF JAIL AND IT REDUCES RECIDIVISM RATES WHICH AGAIN WE SAY EVERY HEARING IS ONE OF OUR GOALS AND I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE- I DO THINK AND I URGE THE CHECKS I KNOW HE SAID ON. AND THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THAT DEALS WITH THIS THAT WE DON'T TAKE RESOURCES IF WE DO THIS WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT RESOURCES MY FEAR IS IT WILL TAKE RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE POPULATION AND ALREADY I THINK WE ARE UNDER. OUR INMATES ARE UNDER CERTAIN ARE GETTING THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SUCCEED AND SO I DO THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE ACTIVITIES ARE FUN IS THAT WE'RE NOT REDUCING SERVICES ELSEWHERE IN ORDER TO DO THIS BECAUSE- THAT'S CRITICAL IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE SUCCESSFUL SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE TABLE AND- I HOPE THAT THE BUDGETS THAT WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. MRS HERE TO THANK YOU EACH. SON OF THIS IT MAKES IT A CIVIL RIGHT. CORRECT IT MAKES IT WELL WE'RE SAYING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RIGHT TO WRITE A BILL SEVERAL GRADUAL IT'S A CIVIL RIGHT AS I WON YEARS WITH THE RIGHT YES OKAY SO UNDER CIVIL RIGHT YOU CAN FILE YOUR LAWSUITS. IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR CIVIL RIGHT TO HAVE THIS THIS VISITATION. AND WHAT I GUESS THE QUESTION COMES IN WHEN- LIKE ONE OF THE SPEAKERS HAD HAD POINTED OUT. THEY TRANSFERRED HIS DAD UP TO TWELVE NORTH. AND IS THAT GOING TO BE A DETERMINING FACTOR IN WHETHER THEY CONTRAST FROM UP NORTH THEY FILE A SUIT TO SAY HEY WE CAN'T VISIT ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S TOO FAR WELL THE NUMBER NOTHING IN THE BILL SAYS I NAY AND LET'S LET'S OF GERMAN TWO SIDES OF THAT SAME POINT YOU'VE JUST SAID NUMBER ONE IS THE ABILITY TO VISIT- THE ABILITY TO VISIT IS NOT IS NOT- ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL THE ABILITY TO HAVE VISITATION RIGHTS IT. SO I DON'T SEE A LINK BETWEEN THIS IN THE ABILITY- TO HAVE ANY LEGAL ACTION BECAUSE WHETHER THE WHETHER THE PERSON CAR SERRATED IS- HOW TO SPEAK CITIES FOR THE HECK OF IT RIGHT WHETHER THEY'RE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHETHER THEY'RE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- BY THE WAY I LOOK AT THE QUESTION THAT WAS POSED IF THEY HAVE THE IF THEY HAVE THE- THE OF THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE- VISITATIONS- THEN YOUR QUESTION OR THE QUESTION THAT I HEARD ANYWAYS- IS MOOT IT'S. IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN. RIGHT SO. ANYTHING BEYOND THAT BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM ONE OF THE ISSUES ALSO IS THE ISSUE OF MANAGEMENT OF A PRISON AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE PRESENT AND- WHEN. YOU MAKE THESE LIMITATIONS ARE THE BILL MAKES THESE LIMITATIONS ON USING IT AS- A DETERRENT FROM. ACTING OUT SAY SOMEBODY'S STABS ROOMMATE- CELLMATE. I'D PROBABLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT KIND OF ACTION BY SAYING TO SOMEBODY OR AT LEAST HAVING TO HOLD OVER THEIR HEAD THAT HEY YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU DO STUFF LIKE THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE VISITATIONS THIS WEEK OR THIS MONTH. BECAUSE OF THE VALUE THAT VISITATION THAT MONTH THEY WON'T DO THAT. SO TAKING AWAY THAT INCENTIVE. SEEMS TO ME TO BE A BACKWARDS WAY OF TRYING TO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET PEOPLE TO. HAVE THE- SAFER ENVIRONMENT IN A PRISON. IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE INCENTIVE TO DO THAT THAT MAKES. AND THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO OFFER THAT MAKES IT SAFE. AND SO YEAH IT'S YOU KNOW I KIND OF STRUGGLED A LOT WITH THIS- YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK THEY ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO VISIT. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW RELATIVES THAT ARE IN JAIL NAY GO VISIT THEM. AND I KNOW NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO IT BUT THAT'S A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW THAT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MANAGE THEIR LIVES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SURE- SO ANYWAY I GUESS I STRUGGLE WITH BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT BECAUSE OF HER MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPOND TO YOU. YES WELL LOOK I CAN UNDERSTAND. I CAN I CAN SEE THE STRUGGLE WITHIN YOU. SEVEN AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I WOULD ARE I WOULD ARGUE WOULD HAVE ALREADY DID YOU KNOW THAT THAT IT'S THE MOST HUMANE THING TO DO IS TO ALLOW- VISITATION RIGHTS AND TO DO IT IN A WAY. THAT IS ACCESSIBLE- THE FOLKS BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS THEM MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NINE TO FIVE AB PARTICULAR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES FAST FOOD IDEA. THE RETAIL SECTOR THAT THERE'S NOT JOBS OR PRESCRIBER PEOPLE CAN DO THAT SO I WAS THAT WAS THAT. BUT IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH THAT I WOULD I WOULD SAY I WOULD ASK THAT YOU LEAD WITH YOUR HEART AND TO THINK ABOUT THE HUMANE THING TO DO IN. A SITUATION LIKE THIS. WHERE WHERE YOU KNOW LIKE DOESN'T FIT IN AND I AM I REALIZE I NOT ANSWERED EXACTLY YOU'RE SAYING BUT I BUT I LIKE SET A NUT LIKE DOESN'T FIT NICE LITTLE BOXES IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. THE HUMANE THING TO DO- WHAT WHEN IT COMES TO FAMILIES IN THE HUMANE THING TO DO- WHEN IT COMES TO REHABILITATION IS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT SORT OF CONTACT. AND NOTHING CAN MAKE A SITUATION MORE MORE DANGEROUS. THE EVENT AT THEN TAKE. THEM TO REMOVE THE BITS OF HUMANITY. THAT A PERSON MAY HAVE. A WINNER CARCERI AND THAT COME FROM THAT VISIBLE CONTACT IN THAT LOVE- THAT CAN ONLY THEY CAN ONLY BE FELT IN MOMENTS- BOTH FROM A CHILD ARE BOTH FROM. A PERSON CUT ITS CARCERI. I LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY YOU WE WANT TO HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE. TO BEHAVE WELL AND HAVE A GOOD TIME EARNED AND TO BE RELEASED- FROM THAT INCARCERATED SITUATION. ON TIME MORE OR LESS TIME. IF YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU WANT A LITTLE BIT YOU WANT TO. THE EVENT THAT YOU WANT TO GET BACK HOME TO. AND SO YOU CAN LOOK AT IT BOTH WITH BOTH WAYS RIGHT BUT I'M GONNA CHOOSE TO LOOK AT TE SAY. THE MOST HUMANE THING TO DO. IT IS HIS TO LEAD WITH YOUR HEART WHEN I THIS ISSUE. THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT RIGHT. WELL I SPENT THIRTY FOR YEARS LEADING WITH MY HEART AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE PRESENT ARE THERE BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO HELP THEM. SO I THINK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT I JUST THINK WHAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT. TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY OF OUR PRISON- THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TO DO THEIR JOB. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN PRISON AND EACH ONE OF THEM GET TO. FOUR VISITS A WEEK THAT'S THAT'S FOUR THOUSAND VISITS POTENTIAL VISITS A WEEK THAT THEY HAVE TO STAFF. AND THAT MAKES THE REST OF THE PRISON NOT A STATE. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT AND I DON'T WANT ALL THAT ALREADY SAVE. OKAY STABBING YEAH. YEAH SO LET'S. YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH IS THERE TO HELP I'M DONE THANK YOU OKAY. COOLEY AND YOU SAY THIS IS A BILL I THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP TO TAKE IT AS R. E. G. R. A MEMBER OF OUR COLLEAGUES TO BECOME THE AGING IS A BILL ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING ABOUT TAKING AS WELL. SO IF YOU HAVE THE ROOM TO DO IT I WOULD LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR WITH THIS. A BILL WITH YOU MY PLEASURE. IT FIFTY PM IN OPPOSITION OR SOMETHING YEAH. AFTER SURE I'M I'M GETTING A CALL THAT EVIDENTLY CCPOA WAS ON TE LINE AND SOMEHOW THEY DID NOT COME THROUGH SO WE'LL GIVE THEM A COUPLE OF MINUTES MINUTES TO- HAVE THEIR OPPOSITION. MACKEY STREET. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- NINETY MAGICALLY BECOME BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND NOT UNFORTUNATELY WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH THANK YOU ASIAN APPRECIATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT DEFINITELY MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE BILL- I'M NOT GONNA GO TOO LONG IN THIS BECAUSE I KNOW I. THINK THAT THE UNIVERSITY OCTOBER MAKING MANY OF OUR POINTS THAT. NOT THAT I IN IN OPPOSITION. BUT- YOU KNOW OUR MOST OF OUR OPPOSITION NOW JUST REVOLVES AROUND THE RESTRICTED NATURE- BUT THE LIST THAT. WE AGREED ON THAT EDUCATION CAN BE DENIED. BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY WORK ON WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO HAVE A ROBUST DEBATE ABOUT THIS MISTER CHAIR FOR PROVIDING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS HOW TO MAKE THIS BILL STRONGER AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ADULT AND MET THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW PRISON **** ARE VERY IMPORTANT- I HOPEFULLY CAN WORK OUT SOMETHING SO THAT IT'S MANAGEABLE- CONTEST IS WHAT WE DO HERE ON THE POLICY SIDE- OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME WORK TO DO ON FUNDING THIS ARM. THE GOOD THING IS WE DO HAVE SURPLUS LIKE WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE SO THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM BUT IMPLEMENTATION IS VERY IMPORTANT WITHOUT A DOUBT WITHOUT A DOUBT SILVA HOPEFULLY WE CAN WE CAN CREATE ESPECIALLY USING TECHNOLOGY WE CAN CREATE A SPACE WHERE. EVERYONE CAN BE ABLE TO GET THIS DONE WITHOUT- MUSIC TOO MANY RESOURCES. AND USING THE RESOURCES THAT WE MAY COME IN TO. SO RESEARCHERS RECOMMEND AND I. THANKS THIS ON A. B.

TO A THIS RECENT SPY AND HATE CRIMES. YOU KNOW EVEN BEFORE THE WE KNOW THE TO HATE AND HATE INCIDENTS. WE'RE ON THE RISE THIS PASS DECADE. BEFORE THE PEN. THERE WAS A SPIKE. AGAINST THE JEWISH. THEN THERE WAS A SPIKE. AGAINST THE L. COMMUNITY. WE'VE SEEN RIDE. AND COMMITTEE OF COLOR. BUT RECENTLY EVER SEE THE PANDA A STAR. WE THAT THERE IS BEEN US. IN ANTI AGING AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HATE. THERE IS A GOOD NUMBER. THAT STARTED. A EFFORT CALLED STOP A. A. P. I HATE .COM. AND- THEY PROVIDE AN OP. FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REPORT. YOU KNOW INCIDENTS OF HATE CRIMES AS WELL AS- KATE INCIDENTS THAT MAY NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A CRIME. BUT STILL IS EVIDENCE OF ALL THIS HATE THAT- HAS BEEN INCREASING IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS STOP AP I HATE RECEIVED OVER THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED REPORTS NATIONALLY. SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED WITH ALMOST HALF OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE STOP áP I HATE HAS HELPED BRING NATIONAL ATTENTION. TO THIS ALARMING TREND. IT HAS HELPED US TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE NATURE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM. BUT IT'S ALSO HELPED AND HELPING GETTING VICTIMS. SUPPORT COMMUNITY SUPPORT FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- AS WELL AS THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BY MAKING IT AT AS EASY AND AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE TO REPORT THESE HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS. WE KNOW WE HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A MAJORITY OF HATE CRIMES. ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GOES UNREPORTED. AND WE KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND REPORTING HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS. AT OF FEAR OF RETALIATION. THE FEAR OF INTERACTING WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SO THE GOAL OF AB FIVE FIVE SEVEN THE REPRESENTING ALONG WITH- MY JOIN AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU. WHO FIRST PRESENTED THIS BILL I BELIEVE TWO YEARS AGO OR OR TWO TERMS AGO.

THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS BOB HOPE MEN AND I THIRD AT THE WESTERN STATE CIVIL RIGHTS COUNCIL FOR THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE AND REPRESENTS AT LP FIVE CALIFORNIA OFFICES EIGHTY OUT IS PROUD TO SPONSOR AB FIVE FIVE SEVEN WHICH REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT JUSTICE TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE TOLL FREE HOTLINE NUMBER AND AN ONLINE FORM FOR INDIVIDUALS TO REPORT HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS. FOUNDED IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN AND RESPOND TO AN ESCALATING CRIME AND ANTI SEMITISM AND BIGOTRY ADL HAS NOW BECOME A LEADING ANTI HE ORGANIZATION ADL DRAFTED THE FIRST NATION FIRST MODEL HATE CRIME STATUTE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETEEN THIRTIES LATE IN TWENTY NINETEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REPORTED OVER ONE THOUSAND HATE CRIMES TO THE DOJ OF FOUR POINT 8% DECREASE FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT FAR FROM THE TWENTY FOURTEEN HISTORIC LOW OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT. MAJORITY OF HATE CRIMES GO UNREPORTED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT HOWEVER A FEDERAL BROUGH OBJECTS JUSTICE STATISTICS REPORT FOUND THAT TWENTY ELEVEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR NOT REPORTING IT THERE ARE MANY REASONS TARGETED INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT REPORT HATE CRIME LAW ENFORCEMENT MOST COMMONLY THEY MAY BE FEARFUL OF BEING REJECTED MIND OR EVEN IGNORED THERE ARE ALSO SOCIAL CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC BARRIERS THAT CONTINUE TO DISCOURAGE MANY FROM REPORTING A CRIME DIRECTLY TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. CALIFORNIA NEEDS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD TO COLLECT ACCURATE HE CRIME DATA AND THE STATE'S IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS ESTABLISHING AN ADDITIONAL REPORTING METHOD THROUGH THE DOJ WILL IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION LEADING TO BETTER RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND OTHER EFFORTS TO ASSIST TARGETED COMMUNITIES THE HOT LINE AN ONLINE REPORTING FORMAL ALTRUISTIC INDIVIDUALS AND TRAINING RESOURCES AND SUPPORT SERVICES LOCALLY THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN ADOPTED IN JURISDICTIONS JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO AND ALAMEDA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES AND THE STATE THE MASSACHUSETTS AND. NEW YORK ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE NEW NO ACT WHICH WAS JUST THREE ENTERED. WITHOUT FUNDING STATE CREATE FARM HE CLAIMED HE TAKE CRIME REPORTING HOT. I WISH AND ANY WE ARE SADLY. A CAN TRY IN BIG AND BIAS MOTIVATED VIOLENCE. NOTABLY ANTI ASIAN SCAPEGOATING AND RHETORIC SINCE THE START OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED AND ALARMING SPIKE IN VERBAL AND PHYSICAL ASSAULTS AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS WE NEED MORE TOOLS TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM AND INSTEAD IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. FOR THESE REASONS ADL PROBABLY SUPPORT. AB. FIVE FIVE SEVEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU BYE BYE. THANK YOU- ANY WITNESSES IN FORTY TWO OH TWO.

AND WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. MISTER LUCKY. YEAH I REALLY I WANT TO FIRST SAY THAT- I LOVE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND I SUPPORTED- THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN VERSION BY CHU IS AB EIGHT HUNDRED I BELIEVE. HOWEVER I HAVE A REAL BURNING QUESTION- IT IN THE BILL IT TALKS ABOUT. IDENTIFYING BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THE NATIVE LANGUAGE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. AND THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT TO HAVE A- MOVED INTO CALIFORNIA HOW MANY CERTIFIED TRANSLATORS DO YOU EXPECT TO BE ON THE HOT LINE. WELL I- YOU KNOW THE DETAILS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION LIKE- MANY OF OUR- BILLS WE WOULD LIKE WE WOULD LIKE TO A DEFER TO THE AGENCY. IN THIS CASE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUT- THE GOLAN INTENT OF THIS BILL IS FOR THE DOJ TO PARTNER. WITH AS MANY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- TO- HELP WITH THE- THE- SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE TRANSLATIONS- AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK WE WANT TO. ENCOURAGE THAT- TRANSLATORS NOT JUST YOU KNOW BE HIRED IN HOUSE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- BUT THAT- THEY MAY HAVE THE OPTION OF CONTRACTING- WITH- COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. I THINK THAT'S A VERY NOBLE GO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY- WHAT LANGUAGES YOU SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T HAVE THERE AND IT'S GOING TO BE. PRETTY COSTLY BUT- I WISH YOU LUCK WITH THIS MEASURE BECAUSE IT I MEAN IT'S A WORTHY. GOAL TWO TO ACHIEVE TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THOSE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE A VICTIM OF A CRIME THANK YOU THANK YOU IF I MAY. I SHOP PERHAPS- YOU KNOW LIKE MANY- PUBLIC SERVICES WE CAN. DISCUSS WHETHER WE- WOULD- WOULD WANT TO LIMIT IT TO THE MOST COMMON. OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES THAT ARE REPRESENTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT- WELL. WORTH LEVELS TO A LOT OF THOSE TWO. THANK YOU. AND IT UP SO THIS WORKS MICHAEL THIS. ALRIGHT I JUST WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL IT'S A HUGELY IMPORTANT TOPIC I THINK A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE SOLUTION ON THE NOT OBVIOUSLY THE ENTIRE SOLUTION AND I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR LEE. BASILAR RESEARCH YOUR THANK YOU FOR LEISURE BRING THIS BACK IN THE AUTHORSHIP OF THIS OBVIOUSLY RIGHT NOW. ASIAN AMERICANS WERE. IN THE SPOTLIGHT RIGHT NOW BUT WE ARE ALL TOGETHER IN A RISING TIDE OF HATRED SO. HAVING A HOT LINE THIS EXCESS WILL EVERYONE OF EVERY BACKGROUND IS GONNA BE HUGELY IMPORTANT RIGHT BECAUSE WE SEE. THE SAME TRENDS THE SAME KIND OF. PRESSURE THAT EXISTS AND HAVING IT. I'M HOPING YOU KNOW WITH THE- NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU KNOW THEY'LL BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS KIND OF THE POINT. IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO. DON'T FEEL AT HOME HERE EVEN THOUGH THEY MADE THEIR HOME HERE- DON'T FEEL THAT THEY CAN TRUST THE GOVERNMENT THEY CAN BE. THEY CAN COME FOR WITH THEIR HATE INCIDENTS. BUT THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND THE MORE WE CAN WE CAN ANALYZE IT AND FIGURE IT OUT THE MORE WE CAN RESULT THESE THINGS RIGHT SO HOPEFULLY. WE WILL BE AS EFFECTIVE AS MANY EXPENSE OF LANGUAGES AND CULTURES WHICH I AM SUPPORT OF- IN THIS HOT LINES MUCH AS POSSIBLE- SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH OUR HUGE BUDGET SURPLUS AS WELL. AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AS WELL AND HOPEFULLY THE REST OF ARCHITECT OFFICE WILL SAID. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR LEE. CHRIS BARKING. IN THE MISTER CORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I TOO WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER MOORE SUED YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK- THAT. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO ALWAYS REMEMBER IS THAT. THESE ARE UNDER REPORTED THEIR UNDER PORTER FOR A LOT OF REASONS YOU KNOW RECENTLY THERE WAS. INTERESTING PRESS BEING DONE ABOUT WHY IT IS SO HARD TO TRY TO HATE CRIME IN THE ASIAN AMERICAN INCIDENTS BECAUSE THERE AREN'T. SWASTIKAS OR OTHER IDENTIFIABLE. THINGS THAT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT'S A HATE CRIME EVEN IF. IT'S SORT OF UNDERSTANDABLE TO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN THAT IT IS THE BURDEN OF PROOF IN A COURT OF LAW IS SUCH THAT THAT'S A REALLY CHALLENGING THINGS TO DO AND SO THE US. DOESN'T GET CHARGED HE CRIME. IS IN CANADA AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE THESE OTHER METRICS TO REALLY COUNT WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE AS A LEGISLATURE. AND YOU KNOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN USE OUR RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE EDUCATING PEOPLE WHO WE'RE FIGHTING THIS AT EVERY LEVEL BE IN EDUCATION- IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND I THINK THAT'S VERY APPARENT RIGHT. NOW ESPECIALLY. YOU KNOW- MY BILL TODAY ON HIS CRIMES IS PULLED BY CAN. AND WOULD ALLOW. FOR JUST CHARGING- AND YOU KNOW- TWO WEEKS AGO I BELIEVE ANOTHER HATE CRIME BILL WAS. AND DIDN'T PASS UT OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS OF HOW WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO FIGHT. THIS RISE IN HATE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE JUST HAVE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY AND I SPOKE ABOUT. HOW THIS IS HOW IT STARTS IT DOESN'T START WITH- GENOCIDE IT STARTS WITH THE HATRED. AND SMALL ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND IT GOES FROM THERE AND IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO STEP UP NOW AND STOP ITSO I APPRECIATED NINETY WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE CLERK. POPULAR BILL- I'M ALREADY A CO AUTHOR- JUST TO TALK ABOUT THE TRANSLATION YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIGHER AMONG TRANSLATOR OR OTHER FOLKS. OUR WHO WHAT WHO SPEAK THE MANY LANGUAGES OF ASIA I MEAN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF LANGUAGES JUST IN INDIA. BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR A LOT OF THESE IS- AS HE SAID CONTACT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS- THERE'S ALSO PEOPLE WORK ITS CONTRACTORS FOR THIS. SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO HIT EVERY INDIAN LANGUAGE BUT I THINK THAT- IT'S NOT NEED TO BE EXCESSIVELY COSTLY THANKS AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS SMALL PASS AND GET SIGNED. MORE QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE ALL THE- THE COMMENTS- RAISING CONCERNS AS WELL AS IT DOES IN SUPPORT- WANTED TO RESPOND TO A- MISTER LEE'S COMMENTS- YOU KNOW I THINK- TODAY'S EVENTS SHOWS THAT TO. YOU KNOW A ATTORNEY GENERAL KEITH ELLISON AND- THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CAN BE- A GREAT FORCE AND- PROVIDING JUSTICE FOR COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT I'M I'M HEARING SOME CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER THIS SHOULD BE- HOUSE IN A YOU KNOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- YOU KNOW IS THAT TO GO CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT- BUT- THAT THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO- GETTING BACK TO MISS A LACK IS CALM AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PUT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- CAN CAN REALLY PROVIDE A VITAL SERVICE- AND- SUPPORTING THE VICTIMS AS WELL AS SEEKING TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ TO REPORT AND I WANTED TO- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BAUER K. AND A COMMENT TO ME YOUR YOUR COMMENTS DURING THE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY YOU KNOW I REMEMBER THAT HOW IT ALL STARTED WITH YOU KNOW THESE THOSE RANDOM SEEMINGLY RANDOM INCIDENTS AND ISOLATED INCIDENTS OF HATE- AND- YOU KNOW I THINK THIS KIND OF IT I HATE LINE- HOTLINE THAT- WOULD. THAT MAKE IT EASY AND SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO REPORT A WILL HELP IDENTIFY AGAIN THE NATURE ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT BECOMES TOO LATE- SERVICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND- WITH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR HAVE. THE TEACHERS RECOMMEND I CAN CALL THE ROLL. AN EIGHTY FIVE FIVE SEVEN NICE MEMBER HAVE TO G. THE MEASURE AS A DEEP TO THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQI LACKEY I PARA QUE HAN. BAUER-KAHAN I WORK. WORK I SAN DIEGO. THEY ARE TOO ZERO TWO FIVE WEEKS WEEKS I LI LI I. THAT MEASURE PASSES THANKS. RIGHT WE WILL. USUALLY MEMBER DOES WEIRD. WE'RE READY FOR AB NINETY FOUR THANK YOU OUR FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT DUE TO THE LATE AUTHOR'S AMENDMENT THE PUBLISHED IN ALICE'S- DOES NOT CURRENTLY REFLECT THE BILL IMPRINT I'VE MADE AMENDMENTS- AND I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY REALLY APOLOGIZING TO CCPOA TO CORRECTION OFFICERS IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT MY INTENT. IS PROP THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED WRITE THAT- PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS A COUPLE OF MANY REASONS WHY I WANTED TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION WAS NOT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE FIRED I WAS NOT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE'S RECORDS- BEING HARD. TO THEM. MY BUT MY NAME IS ON THE DOOR. AND SO I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. BOB WHAT STARTED THIS WAS A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SURVEY OF CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY FOUND THE OFFICERS ARE EXPOSED TO VIOLENCE AT RATES COMPARABLE TO MILITARY VETERANS AND THAT THE JOB IS LINKED TO HEALTH PROBLEMS. DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS NINE STATE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS KILLED THEMSELVES LAST YEAR ALONE. ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES OF CCPOA TO CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS AND JUST LAST YEAR THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN. VALENTINO RICK RODRIGUEZ JUNIOR THIRTY WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE. BOB OFFICERS DURING THAT INCIDENT REPEATEDLY CALL RODRIGUEZ JUNIOR A GAY SLUR MAKE FUN OF HIS WEIGHT AND TAUNTED HIM SAYING THAT HIS WIFE WAS CHEATING ON HIM WITH BLACK MEN ACCORDING TO TEXAS CHANGES ON HIS PHONE. RODRIGUEZ SAID IN TEXT THAT THE HARASSMENT CAME EVEN AS HE WORKED HARDER THAN HIS COWORKERS AND PERFORMED HIS WORK WELL I WISH I'D DONE THIS BILL. A YEAR AGO WE COULD HAVE PROBABLY SAVED THIS YOUNG MAN'S LIFE. IF IT HAD TO KIND OF HELP YOU NEED. TO BE CLEAR AB NINETY FOUR AS AMENDED ONLY REQUIRES THAT CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS RECEIVE A YEARLY MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION WITH NO FURTHER ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY ANY DEPARTMENT. I LIKE THE PREVIOUS VERSION VERSION THIS BILL DOES NOT PLACE ANY INFORMATION IN THE OFFICER'S PERSONNEL FOXFIRE. NOR DOES IT REMOVE THEM FROM DIRECT SUPERVISION OF INCARCERATED FOLKS AB NINETY FOUR SIMPLY MAKES OFFICERS AWARE. OF ANY CONDITIONS THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEEK HELP FOR INSURE AND ENSURE THEY ARE GIVEN INFORMATION OR RESOURCES THAT CAN VOLUNTARILY BE ACCESSED. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES CURRENTLY REQUIRED ALL PEACE OFFICERS TO UNDERGO A PRE EMPLOYMENT MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE FREE OF ANY CONDITION THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL JOB DUTIES HOWEVER THERE'S NO OBLIGATION FOR THE SAME CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TO RECEIVE A FOLLOW UP AT ANY TIME. THIS IS DESPITE DATA SHOWING CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS REGULARLY EXPERIENCED PILOT WORK AT PRIVATE EVENTS AT WORK AND ONE IN ONE IN THREE OF OFFICERS REPORT AT LEAST ONE SYMPTOM OF PTSD POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND NO DISRESPECT TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HERE. I DO BELIEVE THEY PROBABLY WORKED THE HARDEST BEAT- UP IN CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU HAVE TO WORK TO RECHARGE IT WORKED OF CELLS. CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE HIGH STRESSED IN OUR IN A HIGH STRESS ENVIRONMENT. THAT IMPACTS THE WELL BEING NOT ONLY OF THE OFFICERS BUT ALSO THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO WHOM THEY RETURN HOME. TO ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA AND STRESS RELATED SYMPTOMS WE MUST TACKLE IT HEAD ON AND THIS FIRST STEP IS EARLY IDENTIFICATION. WHEN THE SUICIDE RATES ARE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE 39% HIGHER. THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION AT THE SAME OFFICES ARE TELLING US THEY WANT TO LEARN HOW TO MANAGE STRESS AND COPE WITH PTSD BUT ARE SCARED. OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FROM THE DEPARTMENT IT'S CLEAR THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING. THE TOXIC CULTURE IN OUR PRISONS TODAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A GROWING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT WILL HAVE LONG LASTING HEALTH IMPLICATIONS. AB NINETY FOUR REQUIRES ALL CORRECTION OFFICER TO RECEIVE ANNUAL MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS. INSURERS ARE GIVEN INFORMATION TO ACCESS CRITICAL RESOURCES AND CLARIFIED THAT THESE EVALUATIONS SHOWN BOTH BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AND NEVER BE USED AS A CASE FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION. BY DOING THIS AB NINETY FOUR WE WILL DE STIGMATIZED MENTAL HEALTH AND PROMOTE THE WELL BEING OF EVERYONE INVOLVED IN CALIFORNIA'S CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM WITH ME TODAY DIVIDE THAT TESTIMONY OVER THE PHONE. IS HOPE JOSE BARRERA FORMER MARION COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. DO WE HAVE JOSE BUT A LOT ON THE LINE. AT&amp;T OPERATOR. RIGHT NOW. WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR FROM JOSE PADILLA FROM THE CPT A. I GUESS WE CAN'T. INTERFERE IN A MATTER OF OUR PRIDE WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY MY NAME'S JOSE KERALA AS WAS NOTIFIED CHAIR- JONES SAWYER- I AM THE FORMER MEMBER A PUBLIC DEFENDER MARIN COUNTY- AND I'D BE GLAD TO BE HERE TO SPEAK ON THE BILL- IT THIS AFTERNOON THAT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WHO IS IN SUPPORT OF AB- NINETY FOUR AB NINETEEN NINETY FOUR IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT SEEKS PROACTIVELY TO SUPPORT NOT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN STATE PRISONS BUT THE PRISON GUARDS WERE DOING THEIR JOB- DIDN'T IT AS WAS NOTED BY THE CHAIR INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THE GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A STABLE MINDSET AND SUPPORT NECESSARY TO OVERCOME THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT THAT IDEA THE ONLY STRESS I CAN TOP INCOME AND THE JOB IS STATE PRISON IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE WORKED IN IS AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER I WORKED- FIRSTHAND WITH CORRECTIONAL CRISTINA GARCIA DONNA STATE PRISON BECAUSE I DID THE PRISON CASES WHEN I WORKED WITH TWO OTHER SUPPORT. THANK YOU PROVIDES ATTORNEYS IN MARIN COUNTY BOARD DRESSING CASES OUT OF SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT GUARDS ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS AND THE BRUTALITY CAN SOMETIMES COME OUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNDER THAT KIND OF STRESS IS AS NOTED BY- CHAIR- DURING STORY VERY MUCH LIKE IN MILITARY COMBAT IT'S A VERY VERY DIFFICULT JOB I HAVE KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS UNION WITH QUICK AND THEY TOLD ME LATER THAT THEY JUST COULDN'T LIVE WITH THE THREAT THAT THEY WERE HAVING TO TAKE HOME AND UNDERGO HE ADDS SOME OF THE PEER GROUP PRESSURE THAT THEY HAVE TO. SORT OF INDOOR IF ANYTHING WAS OUT OF STEP THE WAIT THERE THE WAITER PRESENTED THEMSELVES ANYTHING IT'S A VERY VERY TOUGH CIRCUMSTANCE. TO WORK UNDER INDEED MANY IF- MEMBERS OF- THE CORRECTIONAL. ARE BUT- COMMUNITY WELL FINE THEMSELVES WITH OF. MENTAL HEALTH BREAKDOWN AND ALL. THAT CAN SOMETIMES BLENDING INTO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY I RECALL THE CASE OF SAN DIEGO WE'RE PRISON GUARD WHO SEEM FINE ON HIS FACE. WHAT THE VETS WERE CAUGHT STEALING THE IDENTITY OF A PUBLIC DEFENDER AND A QUIET CREDIT ARDS AND OTHER THINGS USING A STOLEN IDENTITY. WHEN HE WAS FINALLY CAUGHT HE BASICALLY SAID THAT THERE WAS THE STRESS OF THE JOB IS INABILITY TO DEAL WITH MAJOR DAILY STRESSORS. THAT CAUSED HIM TO JUST GO THIS ROUTE. STRESSED DAILY CONTACT WITH HUNDREDS OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND THE DAILY POSSIBILITY OF BODILY HARM PUTS BOTH THE INCARCERATED AND A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER AT HEIGHTENED LEVELS. FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH BREAKDOWN. AB NINETY FOUR ENSURES THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF AND SAFETY OF THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED AND PROTECTS THE SAFETY OF ALL WHO WORK AND MORE HOUSE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS. FOR THAT REASON- CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IS IN FULL SUPPORT OF AB. NINETY FOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR OPERATOR WE HAVE ANY OTHER A WINTER'S ON THE- I WOULD LIKE TO- IDENTIFY THEMSELVES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TO PAR YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE ZERO YOUR IN SUPPORT OF AB. NINETY FOUR. AND WE HAVE NO SUPPORT QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU WILL THEN HEAR FROM MATTHEW EASILY- SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION. HE'S FROM CCPOA. THANK THANK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND START WITH ROBERT GARCIA'S REPRESENTING THE CCPOA BENEFIT TRUST FUND AND THEN I'LL GO AHEAD AND FOLLOW HIM. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS ROBERT MARCELLO GARCIA. I SIXTEEN YEARS SERVICE AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER. CURRENTLY WORKING AT AVENAL STATE PRISON. I'M ALSO THE ELECTED VICE CHAIR OF THE CDP AWAY BENEFIT TRUST FUND. THE BILL BECAUSE DEDICATED TO THE WELL BEING OF OUR MEMBERS. THAT INCLUDES THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR MEMBERS WELL. MEDOFF HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY. THE BENEFITS PRESS ONE OF ADVOCATES OF ONGOING RESILIENCY TRAINING AND AWARENESS INITIATIVE. WE HAVE AN ONGOING MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS PROGRAM. BOASTING A WIDE BAND BOTH ARE ALSO WANTED TO PROMOTE AVAILABLE PORT SERVICES. THANK THAT PRESS ONE RECENTLY STARTED OFFERING REACT WITH THAT I CRIED THAT. WHICH CONNECTING INDIVIDUAL TO TRAIN PROFESSIONAL TO OFFER HELP. THE CURRENT AMENDED VERSION EIGHTY NINETY FOUR PEERS LESS HARMFUL THAN THE PREVIOUS VERSION THE BILL LEGAL MUCH TO BE DESIRED. I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK. WE CAN WORK TOWARD IMPACTFUL LEGISLATION. I ALSO WANT TO PERSONALLY LET YOU KNOW THAT OUR DOORS ARE OPEN. FOR TODAY'S HEARING WE'RE GOING TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB NINETY FOUR AT RISK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATTHEW. RIGHT NOW MY NAME IS BADLY REPRESENTING CCPOA AND WERE IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY NINE FOUR WELL WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE LATEST ROUND OF AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL- WHICH REMOVED MANY OF THE MOST OBJECTIVE OBJECTIONABLE PROVISIONS THAT WE STILL MUST UNFORTUNATELY REMAIN OPPOSED THREE YEARS THE ASSOCIATION AT THE PORTED IMPROVEMENTS FOR ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES FOR OUR MEMBERS. CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT JOB THAT INDISPUTABLY THE HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS AND CONTEMPLATE THEM IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS BUT THEY'RE FORCED TO COPE WITH. ALONG WITH OUR BENEFIT TRUST WITH SPONSORED LETTERS LEGISLATION INSTITUTING IMPORTANT PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM TO ASSIST OUR OFFICERS. FOR COPING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. WELL THESE THAT WELL THE THAT EFFORTS WERE ULTIMATELY VETOED WE'VE RECENTLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME GREAT STRIDES WITH THE DEPARTMENT MORE DIRECTLY. THIS VALUABLE RESOURCE ALLOWS DOCTORS TO RECEIVE HELP FROM THOSE THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO SEEK HELP WHENEVER NEEDED. IN ADDITION TO THE PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM WE'VE WORKED WITH YOU SEE OUR TO RECENTLY BEGAN USING AN APP CALLED PORTICO. THE APPLICATION ALLOWS DOCTORS IN NEED TO SEEK HELP CONFIDENTIALLY WELL BEING CONNECTED TO RELEVANT RESOURCES WITHOUT FEAR OF REPERCUSSIONS OR NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FROM THE DEPARTMENT. UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTY NINETY FOUR WILL LIKELY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT AND INDEED URGING UP FROM THE KNOWLEDGE IN ANY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THEY MAY BE STRUGGLING WITH. DESPITE THE MUCH IMPROVED CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS IN THE BILL IT CREATES PERCEPTION OF FEAR THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAY FIND OUT YOU TAKE ACTION AGAINST THEM. WILL THAT BE TODAY OR SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE. AND GIVEN THAT THE BILL NOW HAS NO DIRECT CONSEQUENCES FOR OFFICERS AND MAKE NO ACTUAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO OUR MEMBERS. I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT NEED THE STATED OBJECTIVES. IT PASSED THERE WILL BE A VERY LARGE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH HIRING OR CONTRACTING WITH ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO PERFORM OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DEVALUATIONS PER YEAR. WITH NO DIRECT BENEFIT COURSE ISN'T ACTUALLY PROVIDED TO THOSE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. THE FUND COULD BE BETTER UTILIZED BY IMPROVING THE RESOURCES OFFICERS NEED TO DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE CAN BE SUPPORTING OUR EXPANDING OUR NEW PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM OR OFFERING YOU PATH TO HEALING. MIDDLE HEALTH IS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR THE ASSOCIATION FOR YEARS. AND WE'RE FINALLY BEGINNING TO GET SOME TRACTION AND MAKE PROGRESS. THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY UNDO MANY OF THESE GAMES AND DISCOURAGE DOCTORS FROM SEEKING HELP. FOR THESE REASONS WE WERE WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MISTER. THANK YOU. AN OPERATOR TO HAVE ANY OTHER. CALLERS ON THE LINE THE ELECTRICS PRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPPOSITION OF AB NINETY FOUR YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO.

BASED ON A MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION AND PERPETUATING STIGMA THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM THE PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THE BILL BUT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE AUTHORS OFFICE HAS CONTINUED TO WORK WITH US AND- AS THE BILL WAS RECENTLY AMENDED. IT REMOVES A GOOD DEAL OF OUR CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH HIS OFFICE THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THE CALL. THANK YOU MEXICO LINE OF SIX TWENTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. BUT CHAIR- AS FUNDING AS OF THE HAPPENED AT THAT WOULD DELIVER THEM COALITION I APOLOGIZE- I TRY TO CALL IN AND SUPPORT BUT MISTER- YES THE TIMING OF IT SO BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETY FOUR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK IN WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY IN THE- THE ROOM IN HERE THOUGH LIKE TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION. OKAY IT DOESN'T LOOKS LIKE THAT'S THE CASE IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM WE HAVE ANYBODY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ONE TODAY. OKAY APPARENTLY NOT. OKAY HOW ABOUT- COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. MISTER CLARK FIRST AND THEN MR CHERYL OKAY- I KNOW WHY YOU DID THIS YOU'RE DOING IT BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP THE PRISON GUARDS. AND I HOPE THAT WELL IT'S ONLY GOING TO MAKE SENSE TO KEEP THE BILL GOING IF WE CAN BRING THEM ON BOARD- THAT BEING SAID- WE'VE ALREADY HAD A MOTION- I'LL CERTAINLY BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. AND I HOPE WE CAN GET TO THE POINT WHERE- WHERE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- THAT THE PRISON GUARDS CAN SUPPORT BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO BRING UP. BEYOND THAT. THANKS THE CHARLOTTE. SO THIS IS SOMETHING I MEAN THIS REALLY DIVE ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT DECISION AND SUBJECT MATTERS. WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS BEFORE AND PUBLIC SAFETY- JUST DO IN- YEARLY WELLNESS PHYSICALS- FOR A DEPARTMENT A LARGE APARTMENT LIKE- L. A. COUNTY- FIRE. WE WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF TRYING. TO GETTING PEOPLE ON BOARD. TO ENTER AND THEY WENT THROUGH THE LET'S MAKE IT MANDATORY AND THAT THAT DIDN'T THAT DIDN'T GO WELL- WE GOT MORE RESISTANCE FROM TRYING TO DO THAT IN TRYING TO GET THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM AND THEN WE GIVE. THEM THE RESOURCES TO DO WHAT THEY TO DO- TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR- AND IN OUR CASE IT WAS. YOU KNOW TOO MANY GUYS IT WE'RE HAVING MAY WASTE. ARE ON FOR ONE OF THOSE IS NOT WE DID NOT ADDING HEALTH. GAIL THIS THING TO THE PHYSICAL WELLNESS PROGRAM RIGHT RIGHT AND NOW I THINK IN RETROSPECT I THINK THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE. BUT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO PROVIDING THE RESOURCES FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO IT THE WAY THEY NEED TO DO IT. IF WE DON'T HAVE CLIENTS FROM THEM. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT- FOR A PROGRAM TO BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST BE TOO MUCH RESISTANCE. AND. AND IT MIGHT NOT BE IN THE FORM THAT THEY NEED- SO THAT'S WHAT MY STRUGGLE IS AT THIS BECAUSE I CERTAINLY SUPPORT. TRYING TO HELP BECAUSE THAT IS IT'S A HORRIBLE SITUATION- IT. TERMINATES ALL ACROSS PUBLIC SAFETY THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS FIRE DEPARTMENTS. ACTIONAL FACILITIES AND- SO YOU KNOW IT WAS. MY I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. AND FORCING THEIR RESOURCES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT APPROACH IS GOING TO WORK AND THAT'S MY CONCERN. SO ANYWAY JURY'S OUT I HOPE WE KEEP WORKING WITH THE WITH STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY BARTER CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. TO FIND OUT WHAT PROGRAM THEY THINK WILL WORK AND HOW WE CAN HELP THEM BY FUNDING ARE CREATING THE FUNDING FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A PROGRAM WORKED IT'S A FACT OF. THAT STOPS THE SUIT CORRECT SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE REMARK REAL QUICKLY THAT- INTENT OF THIS BILLS NOBLE- I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THE PART I STRUGGLE WITH THE SIMILAR TO WHAT OF MY COLLEAGUE JUST STATED ABOUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE BY AND BY THE ORGANIZATION AND I THINK THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BARGAINING IS PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT AVENUE TO BE INCLUDED SOMEWHERE IN THIS. ASSESS AND IT SHOULD BE RESPECTED ALSO- BUT I'M HOPING THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THESE- CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES IMPACTED THEY UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES IN WHAT WOULD. BE MORE LIKELY TO WORK WHAT ISN'T AND SO I'M JUST PROBABLY GOING TO BE LAYING OFF TODAY BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO CLOSER. THANK YOU SO. CORRECTIONS OFFICERS ARE DYING. WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW. IS NOT WORKING. AND YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A SEVERAL MEMBERS ON HERE YOU'VE ASKED ME TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE- COLONEL JUSTICE REFORM ISN'T WORKING THE WAY THAT YOU THINK IT SHOULD WE TRY SOME EXPERIMENTS- I LOOK AT THIS AS- WELL. GIVING THEM MORE MONEY. AND NOT DOING ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WHETHER NOT THOSE PROGRAMS WORK- LIKE I PROBABLY COULDN'T DO THAT SELL THAT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO THINK I'M TRYING TO TAKE IT AWAY WHEN IN FACT. I ACTUALLY DO WORK WITH NONPROFITS TO FIND OUT WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS I ACTUALLY WANT TO GO INTO DEPARTMENTS TO FIND OUT WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS. AND IF WE HAVE TO MOVE MONEY. TO PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY WORK AND MAKE IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE WE SHOULD AND THE ONES THAT DON'T WE NEED TO GET RID OF. SO I WOULD LOVE. TO SIT DOWN. WITH WHATEVER THESE BENEFITS GROUP IS. M. FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY THEY DO BUT I CAN YOU KNOW IS GOD WE TRUST ON BOTH SIDES TO- OBVIOUSLY BOTH HAVE TWO MAIN REASONS WHY WE DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. BUT THIS IS JUST TOO IMPORTANT. IT'S JUST TOO IMPORTANT NOT. TO MAKE A MAKE A TRY BOB OTHERWISE THEY'RE GOING TO START DROPPING LIKE FLIES AND DYING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING ALCOHOL PROBLEMS DRUG PROBLEMS SELF MEDICATING. BECAUSE THAT ENVIRONMENT IS SO INTENSE- I DON'T KNOW IF AND IF YOU'VE EVER WALKED INTO A PRISON ONCE YOU GET THROUGH THE GATES. IT IS OPPRESSIVE I MEAN IT'S- AT THE END THAT'S WHAT. KIND OF GOT ME WANTING TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS BECAUSE I SITTING ON BUDGET SUB FIVE. I CAN ADVOCATE FOR MORE RESOURCES I CAN ADVOCATE FOR MORE MONEY SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S- AND WE NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW BUT AT SOME POINT. AS MANY VIEW OF APOSTLES SAID- WITH THIS. DRUG REHAB PROGRAM OR WHATEVER. HAVING P. SO. IDENTIFY AND GO THROUGH PROGRAMS SOMETIMES THOSE DON'T WORK SO WE IS PROBABLY- WE'VE GOT TO COME TOGETHER AND SAY WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T AND THEN WE PROVIDE MORE AVENUES FOR FOLKS TO GO THROUGH SO THEY CAN GET ON TO THE HELP THEY NEED WHAT DISCUSSES SAYS. I CAN HELP YOU IDENTIFY YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ANY OF THESE STORES HAVE TO TAKE ANY OF THESE- HELP HELPFUL HINTS. MATTHEWS SIT THERE LIKE LIKE A MUMMY AND DISCO. ALL DAY. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT YOUR ARMS CROSSED. BUT AT LEAST WE GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY. TO MAYBE GET THE HELP THEY NEED THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT THERE'S NOTHING OUT THAT'S ALL IT IS OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BUNCH OF FOLK. NOT SEEKING THE HELP THEY NEED AND IF AND FAMILIES INMATES OTHERS. ARE GOING TO BE THE WORST FOR. SOLAR SPECTER ASKED REVIVAL AND I WILL. EVEN THAT THEY HAVEN'T REACHED OUT TO ME I WILL REACH OUT TO US TO PRESENCE DOES DALY AND SAY WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO FOR. FOR YOUR MEMBERS WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES.
