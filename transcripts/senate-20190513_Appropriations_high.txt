GOOD MORNING MICHAEL MARTINEZ HERE BEHALF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CARD ALARM PROUD SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. THIS BILL WILL HAVE NO FISCAL COST TO THE DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENT THANK YOU. WE LIKE THINGS THAT HAVE NO FISCAL CLASS. ANYONE ELSE HERE IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION. FINANCE THE FILE NO FILE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MS RUBIO. WE DO HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR MS BATES. I AM A MAYBE FOR MISTER MARTINEZ IT JUST SEEMS LIKE -- THE PROGRAM HASN'T REALLY GROWN IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE FINING ON USING IT. ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT BE. A BETTER OF ADVERTISE SO PEOPLE KNOW -- IN CAN BE INSURED I'M NOT SURE IF THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THAT PEOPLE ARE. YOU KNOW NOT GETTING INSURANCE EXCEPT WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY REALIZE A BETTER HAVE AND THEN WHEN THEY SHOW THAT THEY HAVE IT THEN THEY LET IT -- LAPS SO JUST WONDERING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT ARE EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO COST THERE CERTAINLY IS THE COST OF THEIR AN INSURED ANDERSON. THANK YOU RATES FOR THAT QUESTION AND AND IT'S THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION STRATEGICALLY IS WHY COMMISSIONER LOTTE IS SPONSORING THIS MEASURE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CHAIR. SUCH A RUBIO OF OF INSURANCE COMMITTEE IS THAT -- HE DOES MAKE THIS A PRIORITY OF LOOKING AT IT. INDEED THERE HAS BEEN A BIT STATIC WITH REGARDS TO THE UP TAKEN THE BALANCE OF COURSE IS WANTING. TO HOW THIS PROGRAM EXPAND IN A SENSE OF OF OF TACKLING THE UNINSURED MOTORIST POPULATION OUT THERE. BALANCED WITH WANTING TO ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO BEING IN THE ADMITTED MARKET SO ACTUALLY NOT HAVE THIS BE LIKE THE INSURER OF A FIRST RESORT IF YOU WILL FOR CALIFORNIA LOW COST AUTO POLICIES. BUT FROM AN OVERALL STRATEGIC. SPONSORING THIS MEASURE WITH SUCH A RUBIO IS THAT IT'S HOW CAN WE LOOK AT AT AGAIN WOULD LEAN AWAY THE UNINSURED POPULATION EXPAND THIS PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHAT AND HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS. WITH INDUSTRY AND WITH CONSUMER A STAKEHOLDERS WHICH BEGAN -- LATE LAST YEAR AND EARLY AND ALL THIS YEAR. HENCE THE THREE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN TO THE BILL TO CAPTURE SOME PROPOSALS FROM THIS DISCUSSION OF FOR EXAMPLE ALLOWING STUDENTS TO BE ELIGIBLE. FOR THE PROGRAM AT THE RESIDE AT THE SAME ADDRESS PERMITTING. COLOR FINING APPLICANTS PROOF OF INCOME DOCUMENTATION BEING SUBMITTED TO PRODUCER -- AMONG OTHER AREAS THESE ARE AREAS IN WHICH PART OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH INDUSTRY WITH STAKEHOLDERS OF HOW. TO FURTHER REFINE THE PROGRAM TO GET AND HAVE IT BE HAVE THERE BE A A THOUGHTFUL. UPTICK IN THE POLICIES IN THIS PROGRAM. WELL THANK YOU THAT SIR I THINK THAT'S REALLY GOOD NEWS SAID. IT'S A PRODUCT THAT SHOULD BE MORE POPULAR SO THAT'S GREAT YEAR. YEAH THE SENATOR LARA. NOW INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LARA'S TAKING A LOT LONGER AND HARDER LOOK AT HIM THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO AND CANNED I'M CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE IF IT HASN'T BEEN MOVED I CAN MOVE IT. WE HAVE A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU THANK YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR PORTANTINO AYE PORTANTINO AYE BATES AYE BATES AYE BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE HILL HILL AYE JONES. JONES I WE CASKEY. HI BECAUSE HE AYE. THE BILL IS OUT SIX TO ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER. YOU HAVE NOT WAY PRESENTATION ON THIS BEFORE. FIVE TWO IS IT YOUR INTENT TO PRESENT THAT [inaudible] OKAY. YES. PLEASE BE BRIEF IT'S A SUSPENSE ITEM. RIGHT. AND THEN AFTER YOU PRESENT YOUR IS WE'RE GONNA OPEN THE ROLE IN ALL THE ROLL CALL BILLS BECAUSE IT WILL GET. DONE SO PLEASE BE BRIEF ON US BEFORE FIVE TWO IT IS A SUSPENSE CANDIDATE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS -- SP FOUR FIFTY TWO ON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT -- IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME TWENTY YEARS AGO I HEARD THE THREE WORDS AND NOBODY EVER WANTS TO HEAR. YOU HAVE CANCER. YEARS LATER WHEN I WAS SERVING AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CONSTITUENT CAME FOR WITH A STORY ABOUT BEING CONTRACT CONTACTED. BY A RESEARCHER BEFORE SHE'D EVEN DECIDED TO TELL HER FAMILY ABOUT HER DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER. SHE WAS FURIOUS SHE HAD NO IDEA HOW THE RESEARCHER GOT HER INFORMATION BECAUSE SHEWAS UNAWARE THAT THE CANCER REGISTRY EVEN EXISTED. ALONG THAT HELD HER PERSONAL AND MEDICAL INFORMATION. I WAS SURPRISED TOO BECAUSE AS A CANCER SURVIVOR MYSELF I WAS ALSO AWARE OF THE REGISTRIES EXISTENCE. AS I DUG FURTHER INTO THE ISSUE I REALIZE IS ACTUALLY A STATEWIDE ISSUE. THAT I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ADDRESS. THE CURRENT VERSION OF THIS BILL ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT. TO PICK THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF GETTING THE INFORMATIONAL BROCHURES. TO THE INDIVIDUALS ADDED TO THE REGISTRY. UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE COSTS ESTIMATED BY THE DEPARTMENT. THE LARGE VARIANCE IN COST FROM ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE BILL IS AMBIGUOUS IS UNREALISTIC IN FACT THIS SOME BIG AMBIGUITY SHOULD HELP LOWER THE COST BECAUSE UNDER THE CURRENT BILL. THE TO THE DEPARTMENT CAN EVEN CHOOSE TO UTILIZE EMAIL RATHER THAN STANDARD MAIL. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT CLAIMS THAT THEY WILL NEED TO ADD EXTRA DATA FIELDS TO THEIR SYSTEM IN ORDER TO SEND THESE BROCHURES OUT. HOWEVER THE REGISTRY ALREADY COLLECTS ADDRESSES BECAUSE THEY-PROVIDE THEM TO THE RESEARCHERS TO CONTACT THE INDIVIDUALS ON THE REGISTRY. FINALLY AT THE REGISTRY FILLS THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO ADDITIONAL STAFFERS JUST TO HANDLE THE CALL BY VOLUME FROM THE NOTIFICATIONS. WELL I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE NEED OF THE BILL. YOU SHOULDN'T BE FINDING OUT ABOUT THE AGE CANCER SURVIVOR SHOULD NOT BE FINDING OUT ABOUT THE REGISTRIES EXISTENCE WHEN YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH STUDY. YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN YOUR INFORMATION IS ENTERED. MAYBE IF PATIENTS ARE NOTIFIED EARLIER IN THE PROCESS THEY WON'T BE AS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE REGISTRY. I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TO THE CHANGE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND AT THE TIME APPROPRIATE I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER JONES ANYBODY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION. AND ONE PERSON COMING UP THIS YEAR. THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK AND UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE STILL OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS. THIS IS A DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP ISSUE WE THINK THAT IT'S BEST. THE PATIENT LEARN ABOUT THE REGISTRY THROUGH THE TO THE DOCTOR AS IT'S CURRENTLY SUPPOSED TO BE. AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE METHOD PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. THE REGISTRY IS ON A SIGNIFICANT DELAY AND BY THE TIME THAT THE MAIN REGISTRY GETS THE PAMPHLET ARE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENTS. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE RESEARCHERS WILL ALREADY REACHED OUT BEFORE THEY GET THE PAMPHLETS OUT TO THE PATIENTS. AND SO WE THINK THAT THEIR NEEDS TO BE A FIX TO THE REGISTRY. AND AND THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO ADDRESS THIS TO STILL GET TO HAVE GUESTS REAL CONCERNS -- WE DO WE THINK THAT THIS WILL BE A VERY COSTLY WAY TO HAVE THIS ADDRESS AGAIN IF IT'S A DRESS THE WAY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. THEN THERE'S NO COST TO THE STATE IT'S ALREADY. BUT THE PAMPHLETS WILL BE A VERY COSTLY WAY TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. FINANCE NO FILE. WHICH JONES WOULD YOU LIKE. TO COME IN AND CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS A MATTER OF FACT -- THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY -- LOTS OF CANCER PATIENTS ARE RECEIVING THE INFORMATION OR ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S COMING AT A TIME WHEN THEY'RE BEING BOMBARDED WITH LOTS OF OTHER INFORMATION. OR THE DOCTORS ARE. HE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH CANCER YOU HAVE SEVERAL DOCTORS THAT ARE PROVIDING YOUR CARE AND EACH DOCTOR MAY NOT KNOW. MAYBE EXPECTING THE OTHER DOCTORS TO DO IT WHICH I THINK WAS THE CASE IN MY CASE -- REGARDING THE THE FISCAL. TIME. CHALLENGES AGAIN I THINK ADDRESS AT MY OPENING I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A LETTER FROM THE ASSOCIATION WILL TAKE THEIR CONCERNS -- FROM THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE REGISTRY IN THE DEPARTMENT ON THE BILL AND AGAIN LOOK FOR TO YOUR SUPPORT WHEN AND WHEN THE TIME COMES.

YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE OKAY FINE. ALL RIGHT I WILL START THE CLOCK. A LADY ONE NINE WE ARE THE COAST OF WITH THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS WE ACTUALLY ABOUT ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL -- CLEARLY I THINK WE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A NOT ONLY A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE BUT ALSO A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. AND THE COST -- FOR THE ILLNESS OF THE CHILDREN THE LOST OF A TIME FROM WORK FOR WITH PARENTS. AS WELL AS THE TRACKING OF THE POTENTIAL. EXPOSURES TO ANYBODY THAT HAS ANY THE E.. R. IT HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO SOMEONE WITH MEASLES IS EXORBITANT ACCORDING TO YOUR ANALYSIS IT STARTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NINE AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR YOUR ONE THEN KIND OF GOES UP AND THEN. REDUCES OVER THE TIME. HOW DO YOU PUT A PRICE ON? HOSPITALIZATION FOR CHILD AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR SOME OF THE MORBIDITY THAT DOG AND MORTALITY THAT MAY RESULT AS OF OF HAVING OUR EXPOSURE AND OR HAVING THE DISEASE ITSELF. IN SO. AS PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDERS WE CERTAINLY ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF MAKING SURE THAT TOM THIS IS A NEW PROCESS THAT WILL START TO ADDRESS. THE EXORBITANT INCREASE IN TERMS OF OF THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALIGN WITH THE CDC LISTING OF EXEMPTIONS AND SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT. AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL WILL BE MOVING ON TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. TALK TO SO YOU CON FELLOW AT THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WITH SENATOR PAN AND OTHERS. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS OF I ALSO WAS ACTUALLY AN INTERN IN TRAINING RESIDENT IN LOS ANGELES AT THE TIME OF THE TWELVE THOUSAND PATIENT MEASLES EPIDEMIC. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT DO THE FACT THAT IT IS SO CONTAGIOUS IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE. THE FISCAL COST OF AN ACTUAL EPIDEMIC COMING INTO THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WE'RE ONLY AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SOMETHING CASES ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE LARGEST NUMBER WE'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. THE ANTICIPATED ANTICIPATION OF WHAT AN OUT BREAK AN EPIDEMIC OUTBREAK WOULD COST US ACTUALLY TOWARDS THE TYPES OF ESTIMATES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IN ORDER TO RUN THE DATABASE XTERRA. YOU DON'T SEE PHYSICIANS STANDING FOR THE LEGISLATOR APPROVING REGULATION OF US VERY OFTEN BUT THAT'S HOW COMPELLING THIS CASES AS A NO CLUE OF WHAT HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE GOT RID OF THE PERSONAL BELIEF EXEMPTION. AND UP YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TRIPLED IN THE NUMBER OF THEM THAT TURNED OUT TO BE FRAUDULENT ALSO TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE HIGH. SO FOR ONCE YOU'RE SEEING A CHANGE IN THE ATTITUDE OF THE POSITIONS -- THAT FEEL THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED THE HELP OF THE LEGISLATOR. LEGISLATOR TO HELP US DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHERS IN SUPPORT. I ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION -- WE'RE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO OTHER SUPPORTERS -- IS THERE FOLKS ARE THERE FOLKS HERE IN OPPOSITION. COME ON UP. YOUR PRIMARY SPEAKERS CAN TAKE THE CHAIRS AND THEN EVERYONE ELSE CAN LINE UP. AT THE MICROPHONE. AND AGAIN I'M GONNA RESET THIS. AND YOU HAVE A TOTAL. OF EIGHT MINUTES FOR YOUR TWO PRIMARY SPEAKERS OKAY. ALL RIGHT PLEASE START. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SHANNON THOMPSON AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EDUCATE ADVOCATE. I WANT TO EXTEND OUR APPRECIATION FOR GRANTING US AMPLE TIME TO ADDRESS THE DATA. PROVIDED IN OUR FISCAL REPORT THE MEMBERS OF ALL BEEN PROVIDED WITH AN ELECTRONIC IN A PHYSICAL COPY OF THE APPROPRIATIONS REPORT PREPARED BY EDUCATE ADVOCATE AND I REFER YOU TO THE SUPPORT FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL REGARDING THE FISCAL IMPACT OF SP. TWO SEVEN SIX AS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION SERVING STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS WE URGE YOU TO MOVE THIS BILL TO SUSPENSE TODAY AND VOTE THAT IT REMAIN IN SUSPENSE WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR ATTENTION LATER THIS WEEK. ESPY TWO SEVEN SIX PURPORTS TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO THE APPARENT INCREASE IN MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND CURRENT MEASLES OUTBREAK BY ADVOCATING A PHYSICIAN'S DISCRETION TO ISSUE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. INSTEAD ENTRUSTING A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TO ASCERTAIN ELIGIBILITY BY COMPARING A STANDARDIZED REQUEST FORM AGAINST NARROWLY CONSTRUED CDC CONTRA INDICATIONS OF PRECAUTIONS. A PROCESS VOID OF ANY PHYSICAL EXAM OR MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW OF THE PATIENT. IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE FISCAL IMPACT AS B. TWO SEVEN SIX IN PARTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE MUST DETERMINE THE COGENT SEE OF THE BROAD POINTED ISSUE AND MEASURE THE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE RELATIVE TO COMMENSURATE BENEFIT. THE BILL PROPOSES EXORBITANT SOLUTIONS INCLUDING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION DATABASE WHICH REQUIRES A VARIED LANDSCAPE OF END USERS FROM SCHOOLS TO PHYSICIANS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS. AS WELL AS RETENTION OF MEDICAL RECORDS WHICH CONTAIN PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION OF PATIENTS AND STUDENTS. THUS IMPARTS A COMPLEX AND COSTLY LAYER OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE ADHERENCE TO HIPPA FOR BY THE CALIFORNIA CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT AS WELL AS VARIOUS CIVIL RIGHTS IN EDUCATION LAWS SUCH AS THE ADA CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. THE FEDERAL ID E. A AND THE REHABILITATION ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WE ESTIMATE THE IMMEDIATE COST OF THE DATABASE TO BE NINE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS INITIAL COSTS. OF CREATION IMPLEMENTATION MAINTENANCE RETENTION OF PERSONAL HEALTH RECORDS AND PERSONNEL. AS WELL AS AN UNKNOWN COST ATTRIBUTED TO CD PH ATTORNEYS PROMULGATING REGULATIONS AND APPEALS. OF ADDITIONAL IMPORTANCE IS THE UNKNOWN COST TO OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO THE EXTENT THAT STUDENT ENROLLMENT CONTINUES TO DECLINE AND LITIGATION BASED ON PATIENT.-AND STUDENT CONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCRIMINATION ARE SUCCESSFULLY BROUGHT FORTH. THESE CASES CAN COST DISTRICTS IN UPWARDS OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CASE WHICH CAN INCLUDE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES. IN RESTRICTING THE CRITERIA OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WE CAN ANTICIPATE A PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM ATTENDANCE IMPACTING THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE REVENUE TO THE UPWARDS OF FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR. THIS IS A DECREASE IN FUNDS THAT ARE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA CANNOT COMPENSATE. FOR WE ARE ALREADY GRAPPLING WITH YOUR AFTER YOUR DECLINING ENROLLMENT PUTTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHTS MINIMUM GUARANTEE. INDEED WE CAN LOOK TO SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE POOR PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DECLINING ENROLLMENT OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS A SENATOR PENN HAS NOTED HIS APRIL TENTH% MAILING. INDICATING THAT THE DISTRICT IS AN IMMEDIATE RISK OF STATE TAKEOVER. GOVERNOR NEW SINCE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL RECOMMENDS A 15% DIVERSION HEALTH REALIGNMENT FUNDING TO SUPPORT HIS INITIATIVES WHICH TRANSLATES TO A 50% CUT IN REALIGNMENT SUPPORT TO PUBLIC HEALTH FOR SOME COUNTIES INCLUDING SACRAMENTO. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH GENERAL FINE DECREASED 4% IN THE LAST YEAR AND SAW EXCESS CUTS TO LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN UPWARDS OF 77%. AS SENATOR PENN HIGHLIGHTS THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH TREATING ADULTS ACQUIRING MEASLES THIRTY THREE OF THE CURRENT FORTY FOUR INFECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ADULTS AGE EIGHTEEN YEARS AND OLDER. WE ARE EMPLOYED TO COMPARE THE CURRENT OUTBREAK COSTS AND BUDGETARY DECLINE RELATIVE TO PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS ESPY TWO SEVEN SIX ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE INVESTIGATIONS INTO PHYSICIANS POTENTIALLY WRITING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS RESULTING IN A SINGLE DISCIPLINARY ACTION NOT RELATED TO MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS BUT A PERSONAL OPINION LETTER WRITTEN BY A PHYSICIAN. FOR PATIENT INVOLVED IN A CUSTODY DISPUTE. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW THE RED HERRING A FRAUDULENT EXEMPTIONS TO EXERT FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON OUR STATE MEDICAL BOARD RESOURCES. I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THE EXTENSIVE FINANCIAL IMPLICATION OF SP TWO SEVEN SIX TO OUR STATE DEPARTMENT AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND MOVED TO PROHIBIT SP TWO SEVEN SIX FROM BECOMING THE RUBICON FOR CUP COSTLY PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY. I ASK THIS ON BEHALF OF THE LESS THAN 1% OF ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO HAVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. MANY OF WHOM ARE ON DELAYED IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULES HOW POSITIVE SEROLOGICAL TIGHTER RESULTS CONFERRING IMMUNITY AND TEMPORARY EXEMPTIONS FROM LIVE VIRUS VACCINES SUCH AS THE MMR DUE TO IMMUNE SUPPRESSIVE MEDICATION OR TREATMENTS. IN CLOSING I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU MOVE THIS EXORBITANT DELTA SUSPENSE TODAY. AND IT WHEN IT COMES BEFORE YOU LATER THIS WEEK YOU AGAIN VOTE TO RETAIN IN THE SUSPENSE FILE THANK YOU. THREE MINUTES LEFT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER BRIGANTINE ANOTHER MEMBERS OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE OUTSIDE. THEIR PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE. MY NAME'S KRISTINA HILDEBRAND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF A VOICE BETRAYS ADVOCACY. WE AGREE WITH THE OLD MISS THOMPSON JUST STATED REGARDING SP TWO SEVEN SIX THIS BILL WILL HAVE A LARGE UNNECESSARY AND ONGOING. IMPACT ON THE CALIFORNIA GENERAL FUND -- WE'VE PROVIDED EACH OF YOU AND THE COMMITTEE ARE AT REPORT A VOICE BETRAYS ADVOCACY ESTIMATES THE COST OF S. B. TWO SEVEN SIX IN EXCESS OF FORTY MILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR AND IN EXCESS OF THIRTY TWO MILLION AND EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR. WITH AN ADDITIONAL APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POTENTIAL LOSS AND SCHOOL ADA AND OR MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS IN POTENTIAL HEALTH CARE COSTS. THIS IS ALL TO DEAL WITH A VERY SMALL NUMBER BUT UNKNOWN NUMBER OF FAKE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. IT DOES NOT MAKE FISCAL SENSE TO SPEND. TO SPEND NEARLY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE CALIFORNIA GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY ON THIS BILL TO GO AFTER AN EXTREMELY NO SMALL NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS WHEN THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD HAS THE TOOLS TO DO SO. AND IN DOING SO UNDERMINING THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP FOR NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE. ANOTHER STATED GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO REDUCE THE POCKETS WHERE HAD IMMUNITY OR COMMUNITY IMMUNITY IS NOT REACHED IN CERTAIN SCHOOLS. THAT IS WHERE VACCINATIONS DO NOT REACH 95% THIS BILL WILL NOT ADDRESS THAT AS THE MAJORITY OF SCHOOLS THAT FALL BELOW 95%. DO SO BECAUSE OF MEDIC DIDN'T DO SO BECAUSE OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS BUT BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE OVERDUE WITH THAT VACCINATIONS OR CONDITIONALLY ENTERED. IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE GETTING VACCINATED APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ARE EITHER TEMPORARY BECAUSE OF POSITIVE TITERS OR IMMUNE SUPPRESSIVE TREATMENTS AND THEREFORE THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT AND THE FISCAL IMPACT IS HUGE. FOR NOT A VERY AN EVEN SMALLER NUMBER OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. A FEW OTHER AREAS WHICH ARE OF CONCERN TO US WHICH MISS THOMPSON DID NOT TOUCH ON INTO THE UNKNOWN THE HIGH COSTS OF THE APPEALS PROCESS. ANOTHER AREA INCLUDES THE COST OF OUTREACH TO PHYSICIANS TO SCHOOLS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES AND FINALLY AS WE MENTIONED IN OUR FISCAL ANALYSIS OF THE BILL C. PH WILL NEED TO ACQUIRE LIABILITY INSURANCE OR ESTABLISH SOME FORM OF COMPENSATION FUND. FOR ANY VACCINE INJURY RESULTING IN THEIR DENYING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION NEITHER THE VACCINE MANUFACTURERS NOR THOSE ADMINISTERING VACCINES ARE LIABLE FOR VACCINE INJURY UNDER THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX CHILDREN'S VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION ACT. HOWEVER IF CD PH DENIES A MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND SUBSEQUENTLY THAT CHILD IS VACCINATED IN ORDER TO ASCEND. ATTEND SCHOOL AND SUFFERS FROM A SEVERE ADVERSE REACTION THE PARENTS COULD SUE CD PH FOR VACCINE INJURY DUE TO FORCED VACCINATION. THE MEASLES OUTBREAK IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDE THE INCLUDING THOSE HAPPENING CURRENTLY N CALIFORNIA HAVE ONLY BEEN IN 25% OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. THIS BILL WOULD NOT. IMPACT. THE MEASLES EPIDEMIC OR THE FISCAL PIECE OF THE MEASLES EPIDEMIC BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEING TRANSMITTED IN SCHOOL IN THE DISNEY LAND TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THERE ARE TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND NONE OF THEM WERE TRIMMED TRANSMITTED IN SCHOOL -- TREATMENT MARKET AT THE TIME CAN I JUST FINISH UP. PATRICE ABBASI FEELS THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY AND WE ASK THAT YOU RESPECTFULLY MOVE THIS COSTLY BILL TO SUSPENSE TODAY AND WHEN IT COMES FOR A VOTE LATER INTHE WEEK PLEASE KEEP IN SUSPENSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S LINED UP PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND YOUR POSITION. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND JOSH WILL COLEMAN FROM ROSEVILLE AND I VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE THIS BILL.
