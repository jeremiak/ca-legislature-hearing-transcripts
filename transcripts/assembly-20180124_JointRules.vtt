HOW WE COULD TAKE PRACTICAL

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:04.076 region:rollup2
STEPS

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:06.345 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS IN A

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:07.879 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE THE FEAR OF

00:29:06.345 --> 00:29:10.282 region:rollup2
RETALIATION PREVENTS THEM FROM

SLOWER AND I APPRECIATE THAT

00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:09.281 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND IT'S A GOOD

00:34:07.913 --> 00:34:10.248 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND IT'S A QUESTION I

00:34:09.281 --> 00:34:11.516 region:rollup2
THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN ASKING

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:13.618 region:rollup2
OURSELVES ARM.

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:14.920 region:rollup2
HOW QUICKLY DO WE MOVE I THINK

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:16.021 region:rollup2
ALL OF US PROBABLY WALKED IN THE

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.023 region:rollup2
DOOR WITH SOME IDEA OF WHAT OF

00:34:16.021 --> 00:34:19.324 region:rollup2
OF?

00:34:18.023 --> 00:34:21.126 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT WE COULD IMPLEMENT

00:34:19.324 --> 00:34:22.494 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:34:21.126 --> 00:34:23.995 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE

00:34:22.494 --> 00:34:25.830 region:rollup2
PUBLIC TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:27.499 region:rollup2
BUILDING ARE REALLY INTO THE

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.700 region:rollup2
WHOLE STATE TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE

00:34:27.499 --> 00:34:30.101 region:rollup2
INTO THESE ISSUES BECAUSE

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.236 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COMPLICATED. NOW SEXUAL

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:32.504 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT DIDN'T JUST DEVELOP

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:34.339 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT.

00:34:32.504 --> 00:34:37.008 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD DECADES

00:34:34.339 --> 00:34:38.276 region:rollup2
OF WORKPLACE IMBALANCES AND OF A

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:39.344 region:rollup2
CULTURE THAT'S CREATED THE

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:40.645 region:rollup2
SITUATION AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:34:39.344 --> 00:34:41.179 region:rollup2
SOLVE IT IN ONE HERE

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:42.280 region:rollup2
ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE IT

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.249 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.050 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OUR WE LEARNED IN THE

00:34:44.249 --> 00:34:47.252 region:rollup2
LAST HEARING THAT THE ASSEMBLY

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:49.087 region:rollup2
HELD THAT OUR HUMAN RESOURCES

00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:50.355 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS.

00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:51.656 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE

00:34:50.355 --> 00:34:53.091 region:rollup2
VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:54.960 region:rollup2
ACROSS CORPORATE AMERICA AND

00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:57.195 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES AND

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.530 region:rollup2
YET WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:34:57.195 --> 00:35:00.131 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO REALLY TAKE THE

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.900 region:rollup2
TIME TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE

00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:02.634 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED BECAUSE

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.069 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NEW WANTS THEIR NEW

00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:05.971 region:rollup2
OSCAR. NUANCE BECAUSE OF OUR

00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:07.405 region:rollup2

WANTS BECAUSE OF.

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:11.042 region:rollup2
THE WHERE OUR OFFICES ARE THERE

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.177 region:rollup2
NUANCED FOR VERY MANY REASONS

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:13.211 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT

00:35:12.177 --> 00:35:15.280 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF OTHER

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:17.415 region:rollup2
PLACES. AND YET WE'RE GOING TO

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.550 region:rollup2
HEAR FROM AGENCIES ACROSS

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:20.819 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE HAD SIMILAR

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:22.654 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:23.955 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES THROUGH

00:35:22.654 --> 00:35:25.490 region:rollup2
POLICY CHANGES AND WE'RE GONNA

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.991 region:rollup2
HEAR FROM EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.559 region:rollup2
STUDYING THIS ACROSS THE

00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:29.794 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:31.396 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES BOTH

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:33.898 region:rollup2
FOR PREVENTION AND TRAINING

00:35:31.396 --> 00:35:35.033 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR POLICIES AND FOR

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:36.935 region:rollup2
WAYS OF HOLDING PEOPLE

00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:38.570 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE. WE HAVE ISSUES THAT

00:35:36.935 --> 00:35:40.338 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT INVOLVING

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:42.040 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE WE ARE

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:43.375 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT SOMETIMES

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.509 region:rollup2
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU DON'T

00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:45.910 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE.

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:47.245 region:rollup2
EVEN SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:49.247 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT AS I

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:50.749 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO EXPERTS HAVE UNINTENDED

00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:52.450 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES AND WE NEED TO IT

00:35:50.749 --> 00:35:55.387 region:rollup2
EXAMINE ALL OF THOSE.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:57.255 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A VERY

00:35:55.387 --> 00:35:58.189 region:rollup2
DEEP DIVE SO BE READY BECAUSE

00:35:57.255 --> 00:36:00.458 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA REALLY GET INTO

00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:02.093 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES AND TODAY IS GOING

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:03.795 region:rollup2
TO BE MORE OF A TWENTY THOUSAND.

00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:05.530 region:rollup2
FOOT VIEW ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE

00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:06.965 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT'S DONE BUT AS WE

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.633 region:rollup2
PROGRESS FORWARD WE'RE GONNA

00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:10.435 region:rollup2
START REALLY DRILLING DOWN INTO

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:13.271 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE AREAS. INTO

00:36:10.435 --> 00:36:15.974 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY ISSUES INTO PRIVACY

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:17.909 region:rollup2
ISSUES INTO RETALIATION INTO

00:36:15.974 --> 00:36:18.777 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND GO INTO THOSE

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:19.878 region:rollup2
IN DETAIL SO THAT BY THE END OF

00:36:18.777 --> 00:36:21.680 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:23.581 region:rollup2

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:30.255 region:rollup2
SITUATION ON OUR TYPE OF

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.723 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE HERE IN THIS BUILDING

00:36:30.255 --> 00:36:32.590 region:rollup2
WITH OUR CULTURE. WITH

00:36:31.723 --> 00:36:34.626 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GETTING

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:36.461 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR CULTURE SURVEY FROM

00:36:34.626 --> 00:36:37.796 region:rollup2
OUR EMPLOYEES FROM INFORMATION

00:36:36.461 --> 00:36:39.898 region:rollup2
WE GET FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND

00:36:37.796 --> 00:36:40.899 region:rollup2
INPUT AND CREATES SOMETHING THAT

00:36:39.898 --> 00:36:42.934 region:rollup2
I THINK WILL BE THE MODEL FOR

00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:44.235 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:47.238 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY HERE

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:48.106 region:rollup2
DESERVES US TAKING THE TIME TO

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:49.741 region:rollup2
DO THAT CORRECTLY AND

00:36:48.106 --> 00:36:51.643 region:rollup2
UNAPOLOGETICALLY IN TO RELIEVE

00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:53.044 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE

00:36:51.643 --> 00:36:54.446 region:rollup2
WE MAY NOT BE HERE NO ONE MAY BE

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:56.347 region:rollup2
DOING THIS FOR TEN MORE YEARS MY

00:36:54.446 --> 00:36:58.049 region:rollup2
HOPE IS. THAT WHAT WE DO HERE IS

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:59.284 region:rollup2
SO POWERFUL THAT NO ONE EVER HAS

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:01.720 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS AGAIN.

00:36:59.284 --> 00:37:02.754 region:rollup2
SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ARM

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.755 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE

00:37:02.754 --> 00:37:05.523 region:rollup2
DISAPPOINTED I THINK IN THE

00:37:03.755 --> 00:37:06.558 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT COMES OUT AND I

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:08.159 region:rollup2
CAN TELL YOU THAT I HAVE MY

00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:08.960 region:rollup2
LISTENING EARS OPEN BECAUSE

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:10.528 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF EXPERTS

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.464 region:rollup2
COMING IN. AND I'M REALLY

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:14.399 region:rollup2
ANXIOUS TO HEAR THEM. AND WITH

00:37:12.464 --> 00:37:18.536 region:rollup2
THAT I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:20.438 region:rollup2
CALL OUR FIRST PANEL.

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:21.506 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE PLAN OF ACTION. ARM

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:22.807 region:rollup2
WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE YOU

00:37:21.506 --> 00:37:24.476 region:rollup2
KNOW WE WE HAVE AGENDAS RIGHT

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:25.944 region:rollup2
NOW THAT THAT REALLY GET INTO

00:37:24.476 --> 00:37:28.046 region:rollup2
THOSE ISSUES IN DEPTH AND THEIR

00:37:25.944 --> 00:37:29.414 region:rollup2
EVOLVING AND CHANGING. BASED ON

00:37:28.046 --> 00:37:30.849 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY THAT WE'RE HEARING AND

00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:32.117 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT ARE BROUGHT TO US

00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:33.651 region:rollup2
AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE

00:37:32.117 --> 00:37:35.587 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH BUT THOSE ARE

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:38.089 region:rollup2
THE MAIN ISSUES. TRANSPARENCY

00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:39.491 region:rollup2
ISSUES NOT JUST HOW WE MAKE

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:40.992 region:rollup2
THINGS TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC

00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:42.660 region:rollup2
WHO HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW BUT

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:44.462 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT OUR PROCESS IS

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.363 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDABLE TO EVERYBODY WHO

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:47.065 region:rollup2
COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:48.600 region:rollup2
BUILDING. BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS

00:37:47.065 --> 00:37:49.934 region:rollup2
A RIGHT TO THAT PROCESS WHETHER

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.070 region:rollup2
YOU'RE A LOBBYIST OR MEMBER OF

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:53.271 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC OR AN INTERN OR AN

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.873 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE OR AND OR REMEMBER.

00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:57.242 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE REAL

00:37:54.873 --> 00:37:58.643 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S THAT'S NOT

00:37:57.242 --> 00:38:00.778 region:rollup2
SUBJECTIVE THAT'S MORE OBJECTIVE

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:02.881 region:rollup2
BASED ON OBJECTIVE STANDARDS.

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:04.516 region:rollup2
I'M AND OF.

00:38:02.881 --> 00:38:06.451 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE MUCH MORE

00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:08.153 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE.

00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:09.454 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT PREVENT

00:38:08.153 --> 00:38:10.989 region:rollup2
RETALIATION AGAINST PEOPLE WHO

00:38:09.454 --> 00:38:12.791 region:rollup2
BRING CLAIMS FOR AND AGAINST

00:38:10.989 --> 00:38:13.858 region:rollup2
WITNESSES AS WELL.

00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:15.260 region:rollup2
AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:16.861 region:rollup2
THE BEST PREVENTION AND TRAINING

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.062 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY HAVE SO

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:20.098 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE GENERAL AREAS

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:21.800 region:rollup2
NOTABLY EXPLORING. HOW WITHOUT

00:38:20.098 --> 00:38:38.283 region:rollup2
LET ME BRING THE PANEL FOREIGN?

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:38.283 region:rollup2
PANEL IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME UP

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.752 region:rollup2
.

00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:42.754 region:rollup2
AND RATHER THAN READ YOUR BIOS

00:38:40.752 --> 00:38:44.489 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO ALLOW YOU. THE

00:38:42.754 --> 00:38:52.997 region:rollup2
SPACE TO INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AS

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:54.999 region:rollup2
YOU SEE FIT.

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:56.301 region:rollup2
MEMBERS I WOULD. ASK THAT WE NOT

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:57.869 region:rollup2
ASK QUESTIONS OF EACH PANELIST

00:38:56.301 --> 00:38:59.504 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE END BECAUSE WHO'S

00:38:57.869 --> 00:39:00.905 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE SOME OVERLAP IN

00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:02.674 region:rollup2
CONTENT AND SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT

00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:03.208 region:rollup2
ANSWER A QUESTION OR GIVE YOU

00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:03.841 region:rollup2
ANOTHER QUESTION THAT YOU

00:39:03.208 --> 00:39:04.576 region:rollup2
DIDN'T.

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:10.815 region:rollup2
SO LET'S HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL

00:39:04.576 --> 00:39:12.450 region:rollup2
THE END OF ALL THE PRESS.

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:14.819 region:rollup2
I'LL GO AHEAD AND AND BEGAN.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.820 region:rollup2
MY NAME IS JANET DOWN HARD I'M

AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:23.294 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PRICE SCHOOL.

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:24.295 region:rollup2
.

00:39:23.294 --> 00:39:25.630 region:rollup2
IF I CAN OF SPEAKING FIRST I

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:29.300 region:rollup2
GUESS A CALF.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:30.768 region:rollup2
I TEACH ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.370 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP AND ORGANIZATIONAL

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:34.372 region:rollup2
CULTURE CHANGE.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:36.841 region:rollup2
I'VE WRITTEN.

00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:38.509 region:rollup2
FIVE BOOKS A ROOM GONE PUBLIC

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:39.978 region:rollup2
SERVICE VALUES

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:42.180 region:rollup2
ON LEADERSHIP.

00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:43.481 region:rollup2
AND ALL OF WHICH TO A GREATER

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.949 region:rollup2
OR LESSER DEGREE OF DEALT WITH

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:46.517 region:rollup2
THE CONCEPT OF ORGANIZATIONAL

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:49.087 region:rollup2
CULTURE.

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:51.322 region:rollup2
A I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON SEXUAL

00:39:49.087 --> 00:39:53.057 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT POLICY BUT I DO BRING

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:55.159 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE ON ORGANIZATIONAL

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:58.429 region:rollup2
CHANGE. AND HOW TO MANAGE I'M

00:39:55.159 --> 00:40:02.433 region:rollup2
CULTURAL CHANGE.

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:03.534 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO BEGIN OF BY AND.

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:05.270 region:rollup2
DIRECTING YOUR ATTENTION TO THE

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:06.204 region:rollup2
TO THE.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.006 region:rollup2
SLIDE BECAUSE I'M A TEACHER I DO

00:40:06.204 --> 00:40:10.475 region:rollup2
POWER POINT.

00:40:08.006 --> 00:40:13.544 region:rollup2
.

00:40:10.475 --> 00:40:14.245 region:rollup2
MY ROLE HERE TODAY IS IS TO SORT

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:16.547 region:rollup2
OF CREATE.

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:18.516 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:19.517 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS FROM

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:21.119 region:rollup2
AN ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE WHY IT'S

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:21.753 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:26.925 region:rollup2
HOW ITS ESTABLISHED AND HOW IT

00:40:21.753 --> 00:40:28.259 region:rollup2
CAN BE CHANGED?

00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:29.827 region:rollup2
IN ITS SIMPLICITY A LOT OF VERY

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:31.162 region:rollup2
UNCOMPLICATED ACADEMIC

00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:32.897 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS OF ORGANIZATIONAL

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:35.166 region:rollup2
CULTURE BUT I THINK THE SIMPLEST

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:36.501 region:rollup2
ONE IS. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:38.002 region:rollup2
IS THE WAY THINGS ARE REALLY

00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:40.038 region:rollup2
DONE AROUND HERE.

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:42.407 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE STATED POLICIES ITS

00:40:40.038 --> 00:40:43.708 region:rollup2
NOT THE STATED VALUES IF THE WAY

00:40:42.407 --> 00:40:47.011 region:rollup2
THINGS REALLY WORK.

00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:48.613 region:rollup2
BEHIND THE SCENES.

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:49.881 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS IN

00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:52.784 region:rollup2
FACT BEEN.

00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:54.218 region:rollup2
OFTEN LIKENED TO AN ICEBERG.

00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:55.753 region:rollup2
UP AT THE TOP OF THE ICEBERG

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:57.588 region:rollup2
THAT WHICH IS VISIBLE ABOVE THE

00:40:55.753 --> 00:41:00.024 region:rollup2
WATER. ARE THE STRUCTURES THE

00:40:57.588 --> 00:41:02.527 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES THE POLICIES THE

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:03.928 region:rollup2
STATED PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY.

00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:05.663 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE BULK OF

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:07.031 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:08.466 region:rollup2
BENEATH THE SURFACE.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:10.201 region:rollup2
IT WHERE THOSE UNSPOKEN

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:12.970 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS ARE WHERE THOSE

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:15.106 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL NORMS ARE THAT ARE

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:19.544 region:rollup2
INFORMALLY COMMUNICATED BUT VERY

00:41:15.106 --> 00:41:21.779 region:rollup2
STRICTLY ENFORCED.

00:41:19.544 --> 00:41:23.314 region:rollup2
SO WHY IS ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:24.916 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT I REALLY APPRECIATE

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:26.050 region:rollup2
ALL THE COMMENTS I HEARD ABOUT

00:41:24.916 --> 00:41:27.485 region:rollup2
HOW IMPORTANT CULTURE IS THIS IS

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.687 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:31.823 region:rollup2
THAT THIS CANNOT BE SOLVED BY

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:33.591 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING A POLICY ALONE.

00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:34.926 region:rollup2
ALL CHANGE OCCURS WITHIN A

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:36.928 region:rollup2
CULTURAL CONTEXT.

00:41:34.926 --> 00:41:38.496 region:rollup2
AND I'D.

00:41:36.928 --> 00:41:40.264 region:rollup2
YOU CAN CHANGE ALL OF THE FORMAL

00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:42.467 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES YOU CAN CHANGE.

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:44.202 region:rollup2
OUT THE STRUCTURE THAT WON'T

00:41:42.467 --> 00:41:45.837 region:rollup2
CHANGE ANYTHING INTO YOU AND

00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:47.839 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE UNDER UNDERLYING

00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:49.273 region:rollup2
CULTURE AS WELL.

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:51.676 region:rollup2
CULTURE GUIDES AND CONTROLS

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:53.845 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR POLICIES ARE IMPORTANT

00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:55.913 region:rollup2
RULES ARE IMPORTANT BUT CULTURE

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:56.314 region:rollup2
IS IS THE PRIMARY DETERMINED OF

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:58.716 region:rollup2
HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND

00:41:56.314 --> 00:42:00.051 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:01.753 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC

00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:02.854 region:rollup2
SECTOR THERE ARE HIGHER

00:42:01.753 --> 00:42:04.555 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND MULTIPLE

00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:08.159 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY IS MAKING THIS

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:09.894 region:rollup2
pMORE COMPLICATED AND MORE

00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:11.362 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT I THINK CULTURAL

00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:13.030 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN PUBLIC IMMIGRANT

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:14.499 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE MORE

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:16.801 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE

00:42:14.499 --> 00:42:18.302 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF TRANSPARENCY.

00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:19.003 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:22.640 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:24.042 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.343 region:rollup2
PETER DRUCKER WHO IS A FAMOUS

00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:26.344 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT THEORISTS SAID

00:42:25.343 --> 00:42:28.046 region:rollup2
CULTURE EAT STRATEGY FOR

00:42:26.344 --> 00:42:29.981 region:rollup2
BREAKFAST.

00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:32.183 region:rollup2
AND BY THAT HE MEANT THAT IF

00:42:29.981 --> 00:42:33.484 region:rollup2
THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE

00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:35.219 region:rollup2
NORMS OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:38.122 region:rollup2
CULTURE AND THE RULES OF THE

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:39.991 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION. CULTURE WILL WIN.

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:42.493 region:rollup2
MY COROLLARY TO THAT IS THAT

00:42:39.991 --> 00:42:44.729 region:rollup2
CULTURE EATS POLICY FOR LUNCH.

00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:46.731 region:rollup2
I AM IT'S THERE'S NO CONTEST IT

00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:49.066 region:rollup2
UNLESS YOU CAN GET IN AND BEGIN

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:50.168 region:rollup2
TO. TO MOVE THE ORGANIZATIONAL

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:51.669 region:rollup2
CULTURE IN A DIRECTION

00:42:50.168 --> 00:42:53.604 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE KINDS OF

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:55.673 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND NORMS THAT YOU WANT

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:56.707 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT YOU YOU WILL NOT

00:42:55.673 --> 00:43:00.812 region:rollup2
SUCCEED IN TERMS OF

00:42:56.707 --> 00:43:02.380 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CHANE.

00:43:00.812 --> 00:43:04.816 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:08.553 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURES WHICH

00:43:04.816 --> 00:43:10.855 region:rollup2
ARE BASED ON RESPECT INCLUSION.

00:43:08.553 --> 00:43:11.722 region:rollup2
TRUST AND SAFETY ARE THE MOST

00:43:10.855 --> 00:43:13.858 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE AND EFFECTIVE

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:15.359 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:43:13.858 --> 00:43:16.561 region:rollup2
THIS DOESN'T THIS IS JUST WORK

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:19.263 region:rollup2
HERE OF COURSE TODAY'S TALK

00:43:16.561 --> 00:43:20.398 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEXUAL I'M HARASSMENT BUT

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:21.899 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE QUALITIES OF

00:43:20.398 --> 00:43:24.502 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:26.003 region:rollup2
I'M ACROSS THE BOARD PUBLIC AND

00:43:24.502 --> 00:43:26.737 region:rollup2
PRIVATE THAT LEAD TO MORE

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:28.272 region:rollup2
RESILIENT MORE PRODUCTIVE

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:29.807 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:31.576 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:33.077 region:rollup2
TAKE CALCULATED RISKS

00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:34.645 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO COOPERATE

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:35.713 region:rollup2
WITH EACH OTHER THEY HAVE TO

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:37.748 region:rollup2
TRUST EACH OTHER AND THEY HAVE

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:39.250 region:rollup2
TO FEEL SAFE AND THAT'S.

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:43.087 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IN THE ORGANIZATION NOT

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:45.089 region:rollup2
NOT JUST WOMEN.

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:46.891 region:rollup2
SO HOW IS CULTURE ESTABLISHED

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:48.993 region:rollup2
AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S

00:43:46.891 --> 00:43:50.661 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED VERY VERY SLOWLY.

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:52.864 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE FOUNDERS OF

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:53.965 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS HAVE MORE OF A ROLE

00:43:52.864 --> 00:43:54.699 region:rollup2
IN AND ESTABLISHING

00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:56.667 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE THAN

00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:58.135 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE.

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:59.070 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO THAT

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:01.305 region:rollup2
TO REMEMBER THAT CULTURE IS

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:03.441 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE.

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:05.243 region:rollup2
IT IS ENOUGH FOR ONE OR TEN

00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:06.477 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO

00:44:05.243 --> 00:44:08.312 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE CULTURE AND IT IS

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:10.915 region:rollup2
GOING TO BECOME THIS.

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:11.816 region:rollup2
CULTURE IS FRAMED COLLECTIVELY

00:44:10.915 --> 00:44:13.417 region:rollup2
BY M. EVERY MEMBER OF THAT

00:44:11.816 --> 00:44:15.253 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION.

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:16.387 region:rollup2
AND SO EVERYONE NEEDS TO THINK

00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:18.523 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY NOT JUST THE PEOPLE

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:19.957 region:rollup2
AT THE TOP.

00:44:18.523 --> 00:44:21.726 region:rollup2
CULTURE IS ALSO BASED ON

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:24.128 region:rollup2
LEARNING AS NEW PEOPLE COME INTO

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:26.130 region:rollup2
THE ORGANIZATION CULTURE SHIFTS

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:27.899 region:rollup2
AS NEW IDEAS COME IN.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:30.067 region:rollup2
I'M IN ALSO CHANGES IN RESPONSE

00:44:27.899 --> 00:44:31.903 region:rollup2
TO EXTERNAL FORCES BELIEFS

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:33.137 region:rollup2
VALUES ASSUMPTIONS BROUGHT IN

00:44:31.903 --> 00:44:35.506 region:rollup2
FROM THE OUTSIDE AND CERTAINLY

00:44:33.137 --> 00:44:36.507 region:rollup2
THE NEWS THAT WE'RE HEARING. DAY

00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:39.877 region:rollup2
AFTER DAY.

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:41.946 region:rollup2
IN IN HOLLYWOOD IN SPORTS IN I

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:44.148 region:rollup2
BUSINESS I'M IS HAVING AN EFFECT

00:44:41.946 --> 00:44:46.284 region:rollup2
ON HOW WE VIEW OUR BEHAVIOR IN

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:50.521 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS AND SO WE

00:44:46.284 --> 00:44:52.690 region:rollup2
BRING THAT IN WITH US.

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:55.426 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LEARN CULTURE NOT BY

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:57.094 region:rollup2
BEING HANDED A HANDBOOK.

00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:58.429 region:rollup2
I'M PEOPLE LEARN CULTURE BY

00:44:57.094 --> 00:45:00.565 region:rollup2
GOING OUT TO LUNCH WITH PEOPLE.

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:02.033 region:rollup2
AND CULTURE IS COMMUNICATED

00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:03.501 region:rollup2
THROUGH STORIES AND WHAT I'M

00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:05.469 region:rollup2
SURE WHEN YOU CAME TO WORK HERE

00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:07.071 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAD STORIES ABOUT THINGS

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:08.873 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE HAD DONE IN WAYS

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:11.676 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT HAPPENED.

00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:14.078 region:rollup2
SYMBOLS LANGUAGE JARGON.

00:45:11.676 --> 00:45:16.747 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS OF PRINCIPLE ALL OF

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:17.181 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS. INFLUENCE HOW WE

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.950 region:rollup2
LEARN CULTURE IN AN

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:20.851 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.552 region:rollup2
AND CULTURES DIFFERS MARKEDLY

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.087 region:rollup2
FROM ORGANIZATION TO

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:24.622 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:26.190 region:rollup2
SO AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE

00:45:24.622 --> 00:45:28.159 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS A CULTURE THAT

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.527 region:rollup2
IS UNIQUE. I'M BASED ON HIS

00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:30.962 region:rollup2
HISTORY BASED ON THE PEOPLE THAT

00:45:29.527 --> 00:45:34.131 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN YEAR BASED ON THE

00:45:30.962 --> 00:45:35.566 region:rollup2
STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN TOLD.

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:36.734 region:rollup2
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THE CULTURE

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:38.970 region:rollup2
CAN BE CHANGED.

00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:40.905 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.907 region:rollup2
THE BEST PRACTICES IN.

00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:44.909 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:46.644 region:rollup2
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:49.780 region:rollup2
WHAT THE DESIRED BEHAVIORAL

00:45:46.644 --> 00:45:51.983 region:rollup2
NORMS ARE ON A REGULAR BASIS.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.417 region:rollup2
CULTURE CHANGES WHEN LEADERSHIP

00:45:51.983 --> 00:45:55.886 region:rollup2
PAYS ATTENTION ON AN ONGOING

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:57.121 region:rollup2
BASIS.

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:59.190 region:rollup2
I AM SECOND.

00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:01.092 region:rollup2
HOW SO?

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.960 region:rollup2
HOW AN ORGANIZATION REACTS

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:04.862 region:rollup2
THE CRITICAL INCIDENTS?

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.098 region:rollup2
AND AND EVENTS IS GOING TO BE

00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:08.633 region:rollup2
WATCHED VERY VERY CAREFULLY

00:46:07.098 --> 00:46:10.868 region:rollup2
THOSE WILL BECOME THE NEW

00:46:08.633 --> 00:46:13.671 region:rollup2
STORIES THAT PEOPLE TELL.

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:16.574 region:rollup2
MODELING THE BEHAVIOR.

00:46:13.671 --> 00:46:17.508 region:rollup2
REWARDING HIGHLIGHTING DESIRED

00:46:16.574 --> 00:46:18.609 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR.

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:20.411 region:rollup2
SAY THAT.

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:22.079 region:rollup2
SOME PART OF THE ORGANIZATION

00:46:20.411 --> 00:46:24.315 region:rollup2
HOLDS A FORUM.

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:25.149 region:rollup2
WHERE I'M MEN AND WOMEN TALK

00:46:24.315 --> 00:46:27.585 region:rollup2
ABOUT?

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:29.787 region:rollup2
WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE WHAT

00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:31.522 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD NEED TO FEEL SAFE?

00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:33.557 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT IN

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:35.226 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR NOT

00:46:33.557 --> 00:46:36.527 region:rollup2
BEING OFFENSIVE TO OTHER PEOPLE

00:46:35.226 --> 00:46:39.864 region:rollup2
AND TO SHARE SUCCESSES AND TELL

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:41.832 region:rollup2
STORIES?

00:46:39.864 --> 00:46:42.667 region:rollup2
OTHER ACTIONS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:44.035 region:rollup2
BUT THEY WILL NOT GET A CULTURAL

00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:45.503 region:rollup2
CHANGE

00:46:44.035 --> 00:46:47.538 region:rollup2
THEY A INFLUENCE IT BUT THEY

00:46:45.503 --> 00:46:49.340 region:rollup2
WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO CHANGE

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:50.875 region:rollup2
OR SHIFT THE CULTURE.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.176 region:rollup2
FORMAL STATEMENT OF POLICY.

00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:54.445 region:rollup2
TRAINING ORGANIZATIONAL

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:56.180 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE AND CHANGING THE THE

00:46:54.445 --> 00:46:57.748 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THOSE

00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:00.985 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE ALL IMPORTANT.

00:46:57.748 --> 00:47:02.753 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE ALONE NOT ENOUGH

00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:04.055 region:rollup2
AND AND I JUST MIGHT WANNA AND

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:06.223 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE THAT THE TRAINING

00:47:04.055 --> 00:47:07.692 region:rollup2
THEY'RE. NOT JUST TRAINING FOR

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:10.327 region:rollup2
AND.

00:47:07.692 --> 00:47:11.762 region:rollup2
HOW TO NOT HARASS

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:14.398 region:rollup2
BUT TRAINING ABOUT HOW TO BE A

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:19.870 region:rollup2
GOOD BYSTANDER HOW HOW TO BE?

00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:22.340 region:rollup2
RESPECTFUL OF ALL PEOPLE.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.374 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALWAYS RESISTANCE.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.341 region:rollup2
YOU CULTURAL CHANGE THERE WILL

00:47:23.374 --> 00:47:26.043 region:rollup2
BE RESISTANCE TO THIS CULTURAL

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:28.012 region:rollup2
CHANGE

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:30.014 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON FOR THAT. IS THAT

00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:31.782 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OPERATE AND AND FIND

00:47:30.014 --> 00:47:33.584 region:rollup2
THEIR SUCCESSES IN AN EXISTING

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:35.052 region:rollup2
CULTURE AND WHEN YOU CHANGE THAT

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:36.487 region:rollup2
CULTURE IT INTRODUCES

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:38.422 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THEY WILL

00:47:36.487 --> 00:47:39.957 region:rollup2
SUCCEED IN THE NEW CULTURE.

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:42.693 region:rollup2
IT ALSO INTRODUCES.

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:43.861 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW DOES HOW

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:45.896 region:rollup2
HOW TO ACT.

00:47:43.861 --> 00:47:48.265 region:rollup2
.

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:49.533 region:rollup2
THEY. WE CAN SAY DON'T DO THIS

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:51.302 region:rollup2
AND DON'T DO THAT BUT IF YOU'RE

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:52.937 region:rollup2
NOT TELLING PEOPLE IN A POSITIVE

00:47:51.302 --> 00:47:55.139 region:rollup2
WAY WHAT WHAT KINDS OF BEHAVIOR

00:47:52.937 --> 00:47:56.907 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO INCULCATE.

00:47:55.139 --> 00:47:58.042 region:rollup2
AND PAST EXPERIENCES PEOPLE

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:59.844 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE GREAT EXPERIENCES

00:47:58.042 --> 00:48:01.679 region:rollup2
WITH ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE AS

00:47:59.844 --> 00:48:03.013 region:rollup2
OVITZ HANDLED INCLUSIVELY AND

00:48:01.679 --> 00:48:05.216 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY I'M YOU'RE GOING TO

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:07.418 region:rollup2
HAVE BETTER LUCK.

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:09.420 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:48:07.418 --> 00:48:11.889 region:rollup2
SOME SOME SORT OF BOND FOOD FOR

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:14.658 region:rollup2
THOUGHT. POSITIVE CULTURAL NORMS

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:16.494 region:rollup2
ARE BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE.

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:17.962 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

00:48:16.494 --> 00:48:20.631 region:rollup2
HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:48:17.962 --> 00:48:22.833 region:rollup2
THE DESIRED BEHAVIOR IS.

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:24.568 region:rollup2
IS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:26.971 region:rollup2
SIMPLY EXPLAINING THE BEHAVIOR

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:28.773 region:rollup2
TO AVOID.

00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:30.775 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS PROHIBITING A

00:48:28.773 --> 00:48:31.842 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR DOES NOT.

00:48:30.775 --> 00:48:33.410 region:rollup2
TELL PEOPLE HOW TO IN TURN

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:35.513 region:rollup2
BEHAVE.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.947 region:rollup2
AND IT IS ALSO GOING TO CAUSE

00:48:35.513 --> 00:48:38.082 region:rollup2
MORE RESISTANCE POSITIVE

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:40.050 region:rollup2
CULTURAL NORMS ARE FAR FAR MORE

00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:41.719 region:rollup2
POWERFUL.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.487 region:rollup2
AND CONSISTENT AND PERSISTENT

00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:45.589 region:rollup2
REINFORCEMENT OF VALUES IS VERY

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:47.792 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. AND WHETHER YOU DO

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:49.927 region:rollup2
THIRTY THOUSAND FEET OR DOWN IN

00:48:47.792 --> 00:48:51.662 region:rollup2
THE IN THE DEBTS. THE IMPORTANT

00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:53.564 region:rollup2
THING IS TO KEEP DOING IT AND IS

00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:54.465 region:rollup2
IS NOT A ONE TIME EVENT THIS IS

00:48:53.564 --> 00:48:56.300 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE

00:48:54.465 --> 00:48:57.935 region:rollup2
REINFORCED OVER AND OVER AND

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:51.155 region:rollup2
LIKE?

00:54:48.986 --> 00:54:53.157 region:rollup2
IN A CONFIDENTIAL SETTING IS

00:54:51.155 --> 00:54:54.892 region:rollup2
VERY EMPOWERING FOR SOMEONE WHO.

00:54:53.157 --> 00:54:56.560 region:rollup2
MAYBE EXPERIENCING SEX

00:54:54.892 --> 00:54:57.995 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT GIVES THEM BACK SORT

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:59.997 region:rollup2
OF A SENSE OF CONTROL.

00:54:57.995 --> 00:55:01.131 region:rollup2
IN A SPACE WHERE THEY'RE

00:54:59.997 --> 00:55:02.566 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT FEELING THAT THEY'RE

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:03.667 region:rollup2
FEELING THE SITUATION'S VERY OUT

00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:05.469 region:rollup2
OF CONTROL.

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:08.539 region:rollup2
SO HAVING THOSE CONFIDENTIAL

00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:09.039 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ON HAS BEEN REALLY

00:55:08.539 --> 00:55:10.908 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR YOU SEE.

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:13.243 region:rollup2
.

00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:14.645 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE REALLY ABOUT.

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:16.280 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW WE RESPOND AFTER

00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:17.781 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.150 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE HAS OCCURRED OF COURSE.

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:22.386 region:rollup2
IDEALLY WE WOULD BE PREVENTING

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:24.054 region:rollup2
AT AND AND AND NOT HAVING SEXUAL

00:55:22.386 --> 00:55:24.588 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT SEXUAL.

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:27.157 region:rollup2
ASSAULT.

00:55:24.588 --> 00:55:29.193 region:rollup2
OCCUR AND OUR LOCATIONS ON SO

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:32.529 region:rollup2
WE FOCUSED A LOT ON.

00:55:29.193 --> 00:55:33.297 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND AWARENESS AND.

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.932 region:rollup2
I DO THINK IT'S THE MOST

00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:35.165 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE I

00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:37.901 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:38.802 region:rollup2
FOR A LOT OF THE REASONS.

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:40.204 region:rollup2
THAT MY CO PANELISTS IDENTIFIED

00:55:38.802 --> 00:55:42.039 region:rollup2
ITS.

00:55:40.204 --> 00:55:42.940 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE MOST CHALLENGING

00:55:42.039 --> 00:55:44.808 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AS WELL.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:46.109 region:rollup2
.

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:47.411 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:49.546 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY TO TRY AND HEAR FROM

00:55:47.411 --> 00:55:52.349 region:rollup2
THEM WHAT MESSAGES WOULD

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:53.183 region:rollup2
RESONATE WITH THEM IN TERMS OF.

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:55.686 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:56.486 region:rollup2
FOR OUR STUDENTS WE'RE REQUIRED

00:55:55.686 --> 00:55:58.856 region:rollup2
BY LAW.

00:55:56.486 --> 00:56:01.325 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO A GOOD IDEA TO

00:55:58.856 --> 00:56:02.860 region:rollup2
EDUCATE THEM ON BYSTANDER

00:56:01.325 --> 00:56:05.295 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION AND YOU MENTIONED.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.495 region:rollup2
BEING AN ACTIVE BYSTANDER AND I

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:07.097 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:09.233 region:rollup2
.

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:11.201 region:rollup2
FOR ME WATCHING THIS ME TOO

00:56:09.233 --> 00:56:13.070 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT UNFOLDS.

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:14.304 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MORE RESIDENT.

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.339 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURES HAVE BEEN FROM

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:17.174 region:rollup2

PEOPLE WHO'VE SAID.

00:56:17.174 --> 00:56:20.510 region:rollup2

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:26.583 region:rollup2
KNEW SOMETHING I DIDN'T STEP IN

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:28.719 region:rollup2

REALLY TRY TO SPEAK TO OUR

00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:32.656 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:33.657 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT WE REALLY HAVE TRIED

00:56:32.656 --> 00:56:35.259 region:rollup2

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:51.675 region:rollup2
WHICH IS EDUCATION. AND RESEARCH

00:57:04.021 --> 00:57:07.557 region:rollup2
IF THEY THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS

00:57:05.856 --> 00:57:08.725 region:rollup2

COMMUNITY AND. I THINK THE

00:57:30.681 --> 00:57:34.384 region:rollup2
MESSAGE REALLY DOES START AT THE

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:35.452 region:rollup2

AND.

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:55.706 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT MESSAGE FROM

LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN REALLY

00:57:55.706 --> 00:58:00.477 region:rollup2

IT BROUGHT HOME TO ME AS WELL

THAT I THINK SOMETHING ELSE.

00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:10.020 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN IMPORTANT IF.

00:58:08.285 --> 00:58:12.222 region:rollup2

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:05.729 region:rollup2
DO BEFORE FOUNDING PARADIGM I

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.531 region:rollup2
WAS THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS LAWYER

01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:08.365 region:rollup2
ON AND MY WORK INCLUDED IT'S

01:01:07.531 --> 01:01:10.033 region:rollup2
DOING COMPANIES FOR SEXUAL

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:11.501 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:13.336 region:rollup2
I THINK LITIGATION IS

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:15.438 region:rollup2
UNDOUBTEDLY A REALLY POWERFUL IN

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:16.806 region:rollup2
CRUCIAL TOOL FOR JUST S. BUT IN

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:19.009 region:rollup2
MY WORK I FOUND THAT BY THE TIME

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:20.610 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT CURZON'S CERTAINLY. I

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:22.412 region:rollup2
TIME ACCOMPANIED BEING SUED FOR

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.880 region:rollup2
IT ON A NUMBER OF THINGS HAVE

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:25.148 region:rollup2
BROKEN DOWN AN ORGANIZATIONAL

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.716 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND THAT'S WHAT LED ME TO

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:29.085 region:rollup2
FOUND PARADIGM AND IT'S A LITTLE

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:30.820 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT. WHAT I WANT TO TALK

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.388 region:rollup2
ABOUT TODAY?

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.155 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN OUR WORK WITH

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:34.157 region:rollup2
PARADIGM WE PARTNER WITH

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:35.492 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS TO DESIGN STRONGER

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:37.093 region:rollup2
MORE INCLUSIVE CULTURES WHERE

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:38.795 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:40.630 region:rollup2
CAN REALLY DRIVE.

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:42.899 region:rollup2
AND KNOWING THAT YOU CAN GO TO

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:44.634 region:rollup2
WORK EVERY DAY WITHOUT FEAR OF

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:46.503 region:rollup2
BEING HARASSED AS A CORE PART

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:48.071 region:rollup2
AND A HEALTHY INCLUSIVE CULTURE.

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:49.206 region:rollup2
SO IN OUR WORK REALLY THINK

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:50.807 region:rollup2
ABOUT HELPING ORGANIZATIONS

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:52.442 region:rollup2
DESIGN CULTURES WHERE HARASSMENT

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:54.444 region:rollup2
IS LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR.

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:55.712 region:rollup2
AND WHERE IT'S TAKEN SERIOUSLY

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:57.514 region:rollup2
AND ADDRESSED SWIFTLY WHEN IT

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:58.615 region:rollup2
DOES.

01:01:57.514 --> 01:01:59.683 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO TALK JUST BRIEFLY

01:01:58.615 --> 01:02:01.318 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO BUILD DIVERSE

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:03.053 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS HOW TO HOLD PEOPLE

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:04.187 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE. AND JUST A COUPLE

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.488 region:rollup2
OF FACTORS TO CONSIDER WITH

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:06.890 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO TRAINING BECAUSE I

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:09.092 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT TRAINING OFTEN ONE

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.293 region:rollup2
THAT'S WILL. USE ANSWERED IN A

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:11.861 region:rollup2
PREVENTATIVE WAY FOR

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:13.630 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THINKING ABOUT

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:15.265 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:16.666 region:rollup2
SO AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF ANY

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:18.134 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT HARASSMENT IT

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:20.370 region:rollup2
REALLY DOES NEED TO BE DESIGNING

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:21.438 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DIVERSE.

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.806 region:rollup2
WHERE WOMEN ARE BETTER

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:24.240 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED IN PARTICULARLY

01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:26.076 region:rollup2
IRWIN ARE BETTER REPRESENTED IN

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.377 region:rollup2
CORE FUNCTIONS AND IN LEADERSHIP

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.545 region:rollup2
ROLES WE KNOW THAT SEXUAL

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:30.447 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IS LESS LIKELY TO

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:33.316 region:rollup2
OCCUR?

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:34.551 region:rollup2
SO ONE QUESTION TO CONSIDER IN

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:36.186 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS WHERE WOMEN ARE

01:02:34.551 --> 01:02:37.287 region:rollup2
UNDER REPRESENTED. OR

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:38.922 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:41.725 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED IN POSITIONS OF

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:42.926 region:rollup2
POWER IS WHY IS THAT HAPPENING

01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:44.594 region:rollup2
WATER THE FACTORS INFLUENCING

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:45.962 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:47.163 region:rollup2
I MEAN ARE WORKING PARADIGM WE

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:48.865 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THIS BY LOOKING AT THE

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:50.667 region:rollup2
ENTIRE EMPLOYEE LIFE CYCLE WHICH

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:52.802 region:rollup2
WE BREAK DOWN INTO FOUR KEY

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:54.237 region:rollup2
PIECE AS WE CALL THEM ATTRACT

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:55.639 region:rollup2
THE LACK DEVELOPER TEAM.

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:57.040 region:rollup2
AND WE CONSIDER WHERE IN THAT

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:59.009 region:rollup2
LIFE CYCLE ARE WOMEN FACING

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.544 region:rollup2
UNIQUE BARRIERS.

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:03.513 region:rollup2
THE DATA IS REALLY KEY HERE.

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:04.581 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.283 region:rollup2
THAT THE TOP OF THE FINAL WHO IS

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:08.318 region:rollup2
ME YOU CAN'T BEING CONSIDERED

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:10.453 region:rollup2
FOR WHICH JOB OPPORTUNITIES.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:12.222 region:rollup2
HOW HIRING DECISIONS ARE MADE?

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:14.057 region:rollup2
WHO IS DEVELOPING AN ADVANCING

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.758 region:rollup2
GETTING OPPORTUNITY?

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:16.593 region:rollup2
BECAUSE STAYING AND WHO'S

01:03:14.758 --> 01:03:17.560 region:rollup2
LEAVING.

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:18.461 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF MORE SUBJECTIVE

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.130 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES IT'S IMPORTANT

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.564 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE FEEL IN

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.433 region:rollup2
THEIR DAY TO DAY WORK.

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:25.302 region:rollup2
YOU PEOPLE FEEL SAFE.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:25.935 region:rollup2
IN A FEEL EMPOWERED TO SPEAK UP

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.237 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:27.771 region:rollup2
VOICE.

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:29.806 region:rollup2
YOU PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY

01:03:27.771 --> 01:03:30.940 region:rollup2
BELONG.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.542 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE DATA I AM OFFER A

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.344 region:rollup2
REALLY POWERFUL INSIGHT INTO

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:36.212 region:rollup2
WHERE ORGANIZATIONAL AND

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:38.048 region:rollup2
CULTURAL BARRIERS ARE MERGING.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:40.050 region:rollup2
I PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING THESE

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:41.985 region:rollup2
TYPES OF BARRIERS ORGANIZATIONS

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:43.820 region:rollup2
CAN BUILD MORE DIVERSE INCLUSIVE

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:45.689 region:rollup2
CULTURE IS OUR CRAFTSMAN IS LESS

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.956 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:48.925 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THE BUILDING HEALTHY

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:50.760 region:rollup2
CULTURES ORGANIZATION ALSO NEED

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:51.995 region:rollup2
TO PRIORITIZE ACCOUNTABILITY. I

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.296 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'LL BE OTHER NO

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:54.297 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT ARE

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:54.964 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAD BEEN AND IT'S

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:56.966 region:rollup2
SOMETHING YOU'VE ALREADY THOUGHT

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:57.901 region:rollup2
ABOUT. BUT I THINK WHAT I WOULD

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.002 region:rollup2
JUST SAY HERE IS THAT IT'S

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.870 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT GOING

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.272 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE BARE MINIMUM REQUIRED

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.973 region:rollup2
BY LOT. AND CONSIDER

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:05.408 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING MORE PROGRESS THAT

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:07.310 region:rollup2
POLICY IS THAT OUTLINED A TAPE

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:07.977 region:rollup2
OF CULTURE YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:09.245 region:rollup2
WORK IN.

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:10.313 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:12.015 region:rollup2
SECTOR IS DIFFERENT FROM PRIVATE

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:14.384 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS AND HAS UNIQUE

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:15.552 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AROUND. ON ABILITY.

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:16.786 region:rollup2
BUT ULTIMATELY IN LATIN

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:18.254 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION CREATES A CULTURE

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:20.523 region:rollup2
IN WHICH HARASSMENT ISN'T

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:21.858 region:rollup2
TOLERATED. ARM NONE OF US SHOULD

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.326 region:rollup2
BE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:25.695 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT CONTINUES IN THAT

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:27.363 region:rollup2
CULTURE.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.832 region:rollup2
WELL THE LAST TACTICAL PIECE I

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:30.433 region:rollup2
WANT TO MENTION BRIEFLY AT THE

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:32.235 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF THE PLAYING AWFUL

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:33.837 region:rollup2
WILL ANTI HARASSMENT TRAINING.

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:35.739 region:rollup2
ON ANTI HARASSMENT TRAINING IS

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:37.574 region:rollup2
REALLY COMIN AYE IF LEGALLY

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:38.742 region:rollup2
REQUIRED IN MANY TYPES OF

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:40.710 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY NATION

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:42.345 region:rollup2
WIDE A LOT OF STATES HAVE

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.513 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.948 region:rollup2
I AM BUT I THINK WE'LL BE OFTEN

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:46.516 region:rollup2
IN THIS TYPE OF TRAINING IS THAT

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:47.450 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT WELL DESIGNED TO

01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:50.286 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES WE ACTUALLY

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:52.155 region:rollup2
WANT. TRAINING AS OFTEN AND

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:54.524 region:rollup2
REALLY COMPLIANCE FOCUSED I

01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:57.093 region:rollup2
FAILED TO PROVIDE BYSTANDERS

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:58.461 region:rollup2
WERE ALLIES WITH SKILLS FOR

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:59.662 region:rollup2
INTERVENING FOR SPEAKING OUT.

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:00.663 region:rollup2
IT TURNS OUT WE KNOW FROM

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:02.198 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT TRAINING IS

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:03.399 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LESS LIKELY TO HAVE AN

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.234 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:06.136 region:rollup2
PRONE TOWARDS COMMITTING

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:07.303 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:08.405 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE SOMETIMES THINK

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:09.773 region:rollup2
ABOUT TRAINING AS SOMETHING TO

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.774 region:rollup2
STOP HARASSERS.

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:12.742 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO WORK VERY

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:14.778 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:16.513 region:rollup2
WHICH TRAINING CAN HAVE AN

01:05:14.778 --> 01:05:17.947 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON EVERYBODY ELSE.

01:05:16.513 --> 01:05:19.482 region:rollup2
BUT IT MATTERS HOW TRAINING ITS

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:21.251 region:rollup2
FRAMES FOR EXAMPLE IT'S

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:23.586 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THE HIGHLY ETHICAL NOT

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:25.188 region:rollup2
JUST LEGAL. ISSUES WITH SEXUAL

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:26.856 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT HELPER DOESN'T

01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:28.792 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:30.160 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT ON VICTIMS.

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:31.761 region:rollup2
TRAINING DELIVERY MATTER AS AS

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.229 region:rollup2
WELL FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT IN

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:34.931 region:rollup2
PERSON TRAINING IS MUCH MORE

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:36.399 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE THAN ONLINE TRAINING

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:39.402 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT. TRAINING

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:41.070 region:rollup2
THAT'S TARGETED TOWARDS ON JUST

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:42.005 region:rollup2
MEN AT WHAT THE FACT AND THEN

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:44.007 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT BRINGS TOGETHER

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:45.742 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF ALL GENDERS HAVE THIS

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:47.310 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:48.678 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I THINK IT'S JUST

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:50.213 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO MENTION FROM FROM

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:51.748 region:rollup2
OUR PERSPECTIVE THINKING ABOUT

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:52.882 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS. THAT

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:54.951 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:56.386 region:rollup2
VACUUM.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:57.787 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT PRETTY GOOD

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:58.288 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.756 region:rollup2
CULTURES THAT ALLOW FOR

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:00.924 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:05:59.756 --> 01:06:03.026 region:rollup2
ARE USUALLY PLAYING BY OTHER

01:06:00.924 --> 01:06:04.394 region:rollup2
ISSUES AS WELL.

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:06.896 region:rollup2
DOING ORGANIZATION AND VERY

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:08.198 region:rollup2
WOMEN ARE DEVALUED I'M AND

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:09.299 region:rollup2
HARASSED WOMEN ARE ALSO LIKELY

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:11.801 region:rollup2
TO FAITH OTHER BARRIERS LIKE

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:13.703 region:rollup2
BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:15.505 region:rollup2

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:34.070 region:rollup2

CLEARLY

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:11.501 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:12.769 region:rollup2
TODAY WE HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:14.971 region:rollup2
BROADER CONCEPT OF THE AMERICAN

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:16.339 region:rollup2

BEHAVIOR THAT'S ACCEPTABLE IN

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:32.221 region:rollup2
BABY THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE WE

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:33.422 region:rollup2

FAIR.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:42.632 region:rollup2

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:54.177 region:rollup2
DRIVEN BY COMPLEX POWER DYNAMIC?

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:55.244 region:rollup2
A FEW PEOPLE HOLD THE CAREERS

01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:57.046 region:rollup2
AND FUTURES OF MANY OTHERS IN

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:58.314 region:rollup2
THEIR HANDS.

01:11:57.046 --> 01:12:00.783 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:02.718 region:rollup2
DEEMED FRANKLY TOO BIG TO FAIL.

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:03.319 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TOO IMPORTANT TO PALE

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:04.787 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:07.056 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:09.192 region:rollup2
ALSO THE USE THESE WERE. TEND TO

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:10.259 region:rollup2
BE MALE DOMINATED.

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:12.461 region:rollup2
AND I WANNA BE CLEAR THAT WHILE

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:14.697 region:rollup2
SIX HARASSMENT IS ISRAEL IT'S

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:16.098 region:rollup2
NOT JUST A WOMAN'S ISSUE ALONE.

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:18.100 region:rollup2
NOT BY A LONG SHOT

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:20.570 region:rollup2
MEN ARE ALSO PICKED.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.103 region:rollup2
AND WOMEN ARE ALSO PERPETRATORS.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:23.072 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ABOUT

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:24.674 region:rollup2
POWER.

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:26.108 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S ABOUT IT'S

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:27.443 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IT'S IT'S ABOUT WHO'S

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:29.478 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WHOEVER

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:31.080 region:rollup2
IS IN CONTROL.

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:32.415 region:rollup2
IT JUST SO HAPPENS FRANKLY THAT

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.918 region:rollup2
IN MANY OF THESE WORKPLACES MEN

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:37.653 region:rollup2
ARE IN CONTROL AT LEAST FOR NOW.

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:40.423 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COMMONALITY AMONG SOARED

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:41.924 region:rollup2
HIGH POWER WORKPLACES IS THAT

01:12:40.423 --> 01:12:45.194 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A WEALTH OF YOUNGER.

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:46.662 region:rollup2
SPIRALING COMPETITIVE EMPLOYEES.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:49.398 region:rollup2
WHO WERE ENTHRALLED BY POWERFUL

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:50.867 region:rollup2
OFTEN OLDER PEOPLE?

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:51.334 region:rollup2
THIS CULTURE CREATES PERFECT

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.569 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS FOR SEXUAL

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:54.870 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:57.039 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO ONE THAT IS RIGHT FOR

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.574 region:rollup2
POSITIVE TRANSFORMATION.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:59.575 region:rollup2
AND IT'S TIME FOR A CULTURAL

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:01.444 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION IN YOUR

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:02.778 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE WORKPLACES.

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:05.381 region:rollup2
AND AS A LEADER IN WORKPLACE

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:07.149 region:rollup2
CHANGE CALIFORNIA MUST STARTED

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:09.418 region:rollup2
IN NAME A START IT RIGHT HERE

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:11.854 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW SO I I. PRAISE YOU AYE

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:12.788 region:rollup2
LOGIC FOR DOING THIS WORK.

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:15.258 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT ONE OF MY CO

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:16.826 region:rollup2
PANELISTS IS MENTIONED CULTURE

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:18.928 region:rollup2
ALWAYS TRUMP'S COMPLIANT.

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:20.863 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:22.999 region:rollup2
CHARMS PERSPECTIVE IS UNIQUE

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:23.933 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE REPRESENT NOT JUST

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:25.701 region:rollup2
ONE SEGMENT OF THE EMPLOYMENT

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:26.736 region:rollup2
SECTOR.

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:27.803 region:rollup2
BUT A PROFESSION THAT SPANS ALL

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:30.072 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:31.007 region:rollup2
INCLUDING COMPANIES

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.675 region:rollup2
FOR PROFIT NONPROFIT A

01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:34.076 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:35.811 region:rollup2
AND WORK HARD WORK FORCES THAT A

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:37.780 region:rollup2
LARGE AND SMALL.

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:39.115 region:rollup2
I MEMBERS HAVE SEEN IT ALL AND

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.816 region:rollup2
THEY LET US KNOW WHAT WORKS AND

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:42.785 region:rollup2
WHAT DOESN'T.

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:45.087 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHAT DOESN'T WORK.

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:47.790 region:rollup2
RELYING ON COMPLIANCE.

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:48.357 region:rollup2
RULES EDUCATION AND TRAINING

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:50.326 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT OR ADDRESS SEXUAL

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:52.161 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:13:50.326 --> 01:13:54.230 region:rollup2
IT'S TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SELECT

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:56.065 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE REPORT ON HARASSMENT

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:57.600 region:rollup2
THE EOC RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:59.168 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE TRAINING CANNOT OCCUR

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.803 region:rollup2
IN A VACUUM.

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:02.538 region:rollup2
IT MUST BE PART OF A HOLISTIC

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:05.474 region:rollup2
CULTURE OF NON HARASSMENT

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:07.343 region:rollup2
THAT STARTS AT THE TOP.

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:09.078 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE IS A KEY COMPONENT OF

01:14:07.343 --> 01:14:10.780 region:rollup2
HER HER OF A HARASSMENT FREE

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:12.515 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE BUT IN REALITY WE

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.816 region:rollup2
COULD DEMAND THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE

01:14:12.515 --> 01:14:14.917 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE IN YOUR OFFICES

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:16.419 region:rollup2
COULD DEMAND THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:18.654 region:rollup2
TAKE TEN HOURS OF SEXUAL

01:14:16.419 --> 01:14:20.990 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT TRAINING EVERY WEEK.

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:22.091 region:rollup2
AND IT'S STILL GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:23.526 region:rollup2
BY THE SAME TOKEN WE CAN ENFORCE

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:24.527 region:rollup2
THE SPEED

01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:25.895 region:rollup2
THIS POLICIES FOR BEATING

01:14:24.527 --> 01:14:28.164 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE RELATIONSHIPS.

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:29.065 region:rollup2
AS THE EASY ANSWER.

01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:31.067 region:rollup2
BUT OFFICE ROMANCE IS GOING TO

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:33.035 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:34.904 region:rollup2
YOU SIMPLY CAN'T IGNORE OR

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:37.206 region:rollup2
LEGISLATE HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:39.575 region:rollup2
HUMAN BEHAVIOR SO IT'S IMPORTANT

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:41.210 region:rollup2
FOR US TO DEAL IN REALITY.

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:42.878 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN CASE AFTER

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:45.147 region:rollup2
CASE WERE PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIORS

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:46.382 region:rollup2
AND SITUATIONS NEVER RISE TO THE

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:48.117 region:rollup2
LEGAL DEBATE DEFINITION OF

01:14:46.382 --> 01:14:48.684 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:50.219 region:rollup2
BUT ARE PROBLEMATIC NONE THE

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:51.787 region:rollup2
LESS

PROFESSOR KIM COB GEORGE

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:54.790 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY PUT IT

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:56.258 region:rollup2
BEST WHEN SHE SAYS THERE'S A BIG

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:58.227 region:rollup2
GRAY ZONE.

01:14:56.258 --> 01:15:00.730 region:rollup2
BETWEEN LEGAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT

ANY CULTURE OF INCLUSION.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:04.467 region:rollup2
AND SHE SAID IN BACK GRADIENT

01:15:02.031 --> 01:15:05.968 region:rollup2
REAL DAMAGE IS BEING DONE ON A

DAILY BASIS THAT'S CHANGING

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:09.772 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S LIVES AND CHANGING THE

TRAJECTORY OF THEIR CAREERS.

01:15:09.772 --> 01:15:13.642 region:rollup2
THAT'S REAL. THIS IS WHY I URGE

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:15.077 region:rollup2
YOU NOT TO BE IN THE WORD BY THE

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:16.512 region:rollup2

HARASSMENT COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.616 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO COME AND CONSIDER

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:23.052 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT NINETY EIGHT

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:25.187 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF US WORKPLACES HAVE

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:26.422 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:28.824 region:rollup2
AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM

01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:30.826 region:rollup2
TOO A LOT OF EXPENSIVE TRAINING.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:32.661 region:rollup2
AND YET HERE WE ARE.

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:34.530 region:rollup2

FRANKLY WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:15.504 region:rollup2
EVEN ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES

HAVE NO AFFECT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T

FEEL SAFE TO REPORT HARASSMENT.

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.944 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO

TO REPORT TO REPORT THE PEOPLE.

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:25.347 region:rollup2
WHO WHO ENGAGE IN THIS BEHAVIOR?

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:27.016 region:rollup2
WE DON'T SEE SUCCESS AND MISS

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:28.117 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:28.417 region:rollup2
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE TO

01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:30.453 region:rollup2
MARGINALIZE

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:32.688 region:rollup2
DISTRUST

HELP US CULTURE MAKE REAL

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:37.460 region:rollup2
CULTURAL CHANGE.

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:38.828 region:rollup2
MANUALS AND TRAINING SO USELESS

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:41.664 region:rollup2
AND WORK PLACES WHERE BAD

01:16:38.828 --> 01:16:43.799 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR IS SILENTLY TOLERATED.

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:46.035 region:rollup2
IT IS CULTURE NOT COMPLIANCE

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:48.704 region:rollup2
THAT GUIDES WORKPLACE CONDUCT.

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:50.072 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:50.806 region:rollup2
LET'S BRING THIS DISCUSSION HERE

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:52.775 region:rollup2
TO THIS STATE AND LEGISLATIVE

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:53.943 region:rollup2
BODY.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:55.544 region:rollup2
BUT THE STATE SENATE AND THE

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:57.046 region:rollup2

01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:02.818 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE STANDARDS ARE NOT

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:04.553 region:rollup2
ALIVE.

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:06.288 region:rollup2
INSIDE OF USED TO IT ONE WAY OUT

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:10.126 region:rollup2
OF THE SIDES TO ANOTHER WAY.

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:11.727 region:rollup2
AND CLEARLY IT'S NOT WORKING.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:13.362 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS THINK UNLOADS HER

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:14.964 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA WITH

SIXTEEN.

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:40.055 region:rollup2
IN ANY CASE NONE OF THIS WOULD

01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:41.757 region:rollup2
HAVE MATTERED IF THE CULTURE HAD

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:42.892 region:rollup2
BEEN THE RIGHT ONE.

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:45.528 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS COULD HAVE BEEN

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:46.795 region:rollup2
AVERTED OR RESOLVED LONG BEFORE

01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:47.963 region:rollup2
GETTING TO LEVEL OF COMMITTEES

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:50.199 region:rollup2
AND CLAIMS BEING FILED AND

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:51.700 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS.

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:52.968 region:rollup2
THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE WE

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.469 region:rollup2
LIKE TO THINK OF THIS LIKE THE

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:54.970 region:rollup2
HUMAN BODY WHEN IT WORKS

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:56.205 region:rollup2
PROPERLY.

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:58.240 region:rollup2
VIRUSES AND TOXINS ARE NATURALLY

01:17:56.205 --> 01:18:00.643 region:rollup2
EX.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.211 region:rollup2
RIGHT IN A HEALTHY WORKPLACE.

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:03.445 region:rollup2
AND UP WITH A HEALTHY WORKPLACE

01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:05.381 region:rollup2
CULTURE WHEN SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:07.049 region:rollup2
IS OBSERVED OR EXPERIENCE THE

01:18:05.381 --> 01:18:08.083 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY TAKES OVER.

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:10.152 region:rollup2
AND SHUTS IT DOWN COLLECTIVELY

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:11.620 region:rollup2
AS YOU.

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:12.221 region:rollup2
WITH THE MESSAGE THAT THIS

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.656 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR WILL NOT BE TOLERATED

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:16.492 region:rollup2
HE.

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:18.027 region:rollup2
BY ANYONE AT ANY LEVEL.

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:19.528 region:rollup2
IDEALLY SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:22.431 region:rollup2
DOESN'T OCCUR AT ALL BECAUSE THE

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:24.133 region:rollup2
BODY SIMPLY INOCULATE SELF.

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:26.235 region:rollup2
WITH HEALTHY NORMS EXPECTATIONS

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:27.836 region:rollup2
AND STANDARDS.

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:29.204 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY THE TASK FOR YOU

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:30.706 region:rollup2
WE CAN GO AND ENGAGE IN ALL

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:31.640 region:rollup2
SORTS OF SEX HARASSMENT TRAINING

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:33.008 region:rollup2
MANDATORY TRAINING MICHAEL

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.743 region:rollup2
PANELIST JUST SUGGESTED BRINGING

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:36.545 region:rollup2
IN PEOPLE WHO ARE INCLINED TO

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:38.047 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN THIS BEHAVIOR TRAINING

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:39.448 region:rollup2
THEM DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:41.350 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:43.118 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE CULTURE.

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:43.619 region:rollup2
AND IN A VERY PRACTICAL WAY.

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:46.088 region:rollup2
ONE WAY TO GET A HEALTHY

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:47.456 region:rollup2
CULTURE.

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:49.058 region:rollup2
THAT WILL NOT TOLERATE SEX

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:50.793 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IS BY CHOOSING TO BE

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:51.360 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL ABOUT PEOPLE AND I'M

01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:53.262 region:rollup2
GONNA FINISH ON THIS REALLY

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.163 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WE ASK YOU.

01:18:53.262 --> 01:18:56.999 region:rollup2
WHAT IS YOUR POLICY A WORKPLACE

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:58.534 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP?

01:18:56.999 --> 01:18:59.902 region:rollup2
HERE THE CAPITAL YOU EMPLOY A

01:18:58.534 --> 01:19:00.803 region:rollup2
LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:02.738 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT BEFORE MANY OF

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:04.440 region:rollup2
THEM SINGLE MOST OF THEM QUITE

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:06.642 region:rollup2
AMBITIOUS.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.711 region:rollup2
THEY WILL PROCEED PURSUE EACH

01:19:06.642 --> 01:19:10.546 region:rollup2
OTHER WITH THEIR MENTORS AND

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:13.482 region:rollup2
THEIR ROLE MODELS.

01:19:10.546 --> 01:19:19.822 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST HUMAN NATURE.

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:20.356 region:rollup2
AND RELATIONS.

01:19:19.822 --> 01:19:21.757 region:rollup2
BUT THEM OUT LOS JUST GO

01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:23.859 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:25.995 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING TO A CULTURE OF

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:27.830 region:rollup2
DISHONESTY AND SECRECY

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:29.064 region:rollup2
SO THE VERY THING THAT YOU'RE

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:30.666 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SOLVE FOR IN THE WAY

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:33.569 region:rollup2
SHE CREATING.

01:19:30.666 --> 01:19:35.237 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY ARE DISCOVERED

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:36.472 region:rollup2
YOU ARE NOW FACED WITH THE

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:38.607 region:rollup2
CHOICE OF FIRING ONE OR THE

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:40.776 region:rollup2
OTHER OR BOTH AND ORGANIZATION

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:41.944 region:rollup2
LUCIS TALENT CRITICAL TALENT.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:44.346 region:rollup2
INSTEAD YOU COULD FOLLOW A

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:46.715 region:rollup2
POLICY OF DISCLOSURE.

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:48.284 region:rollup2
NOT UNLIKE WHAT WE DO WITH

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:49.918 region:rollup2
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST POLICIES

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:50.953 region:rollup2
ONE A REAL ACTUAL EXAMPLE OF

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:52.721 region:rollup2
WHAT COMPANIES ARE DOING IN

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:54.123 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING. THEY'RE

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:55.491 region:rollup2
SAYING IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:57.660 region:rollup2
TO TRANSPARENCY IN THE TRUEST

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:59.094 region:rollup2
SENSE ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:00.562 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITHOUT FEAR OF

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:01.730 region:rollup2
REPRISALS.

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:02.898 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THEM AND GIVE THEM A

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.800 region:rollup2
NOTHER PATHWAY.

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:07.636 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THEIR WORK RELATIONSHIP

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.337 region:rollup2
AND THEIR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.973 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE TO GET REALLY

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:13.008 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL ABOUT THIS.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:14.476 region:rollup2
TWO OTHER ELEMENTS IN

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:16.111 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING HEALTHY CUT TO IN A

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:17.346 region:rollup2
CAR HEALTHY CULTURE ARE SWIFT

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:19.982 region:rollup2
ACTION AND TRANSPARENCY.

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:20.449 region:rollup2
CLAIMS OF HARASSMENT OBVIOUSLY

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.618 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:24.219 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY QUICKLY. AND IDEALLY

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:25.521 region:rollup2
BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL.

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:26.755 region:rollup2
AND IF BEHAVIOR IS FOUND TO

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:27.389 region:rollup2
VIOLATE THE CULTURE OF THE

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:28.557 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THAT INDIVIDUAL SHE

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:29.925 region:rollup2
BE

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:31.393 region:rollup2
OBJECTED TO PROGRESSIVE

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:32.961 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES UP TO

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.862 region:rollup2
AND INCLUDING BARRY.

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:35.764 region:rollup2
BUT THIS BRINGS US TO A CRITICAL

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:37.900 region:rollup2
POINT.

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:39.735 region:rollup2
IN THE ZEAL.

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:41.437 region:rollup2
TO ROUTE OUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:20:39.735 --> 01:20:42.771 region:rollup2
AND OTHER FORMS OF HARASSMENT

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:44.139 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS MOVE MUST BE

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:46.342 region:rollup2
CAREFUL NOT TO SWING TOO FAR IN

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:49.078 region:rollup2
THE OTHER DIRECTION.

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:51.513 region:rollup2
CREATING A GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:52.815 region:rollup2
INNOCENT STANDARD.

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:54.983 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY

01:20:52.815 --> 01:20:55.918 region:rollup2
POPULAR BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:58.220 region:rollup2
REALITY WE ALL HAVE MADE IN OUR

01:20:55.918 --> 01:21:00.189 region:rollup2
LIVES WHO. COULD BE REALLY

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.523 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY THIS AS WELL.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:02.091 region:rollup2
BIDDY SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:04.893 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS ARE FOUND TO BE

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:06.762 region:rollup2
UNSUBSTANTIATED.

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:09.031 region:rollup2
MANY ARE FOUND BE

01:21:06.762 --> 01:21:11.233 region:rollup2
UNSUBSTANTIATED EEL CELLS EEOC

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:12.968 region:rollup2
TELLS US THAT AND IN SOME CASES

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:14.570 region:rollup2
THEY'RE OUT RIGHT ON TROOPS

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:15.938 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT THE LEGAL STANDARD

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.505 region:rollup2
PRODIGIOUS OUTRIGHT UNTRUE.

01:21:15.938 --> 01:21:18.540 region:rollup2
A TRUST WORTHY DUE PROCESS

01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:20.909 region:rollup2
SHOULD

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.811 region:rollup2
TECH BE ACCUSED UNTIL HERE SHE

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:24.113 region:rollup2
IS POUND EITHER RESPONSIBLE OR

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:25.547 region:rollup2
INNOCENT OF THE WRONGDOING.

01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:28.484 region:rollup2
I RECOMMEND THAT YOU TAKE EVERY

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:29.752 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION SERIOUSLY OF COURSE.

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:31.420 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE IT PROPERLY AND

01:21:29.752 --> 01:21:33.522 region:rollup2
ADJUDICATED FAIRLY QUICKLY AND

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:34.823 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:37.392 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WORKPLACE

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:39.495 region:rollup2
WHERE EVERYONE FEELS SAFE.

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:40.863 region:rollup2
AND THIS CAN'T GO ONE WAY.

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:43.065 region:rollup2
CHEN HAS DEVELOPED MANY MANY

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:43.999 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:45.834 region:rollup2
FOR SUSTAINING A HEALTHY

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:47.169 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:47.903 region:rollup2
LOOK AT OUR MEMBER TOOL KIT

01:21:47.169 --> 01:21:49.304 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE REAL LIFE

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:50.939 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES FROM WHERE REAL LIFE

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:52.107 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES. WHO CAN TELL YOU HOW

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:54.376 region:rollup2
TO HELP GET THIS RIGHT?

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:57.146 region:rollup2
THIS TAKES COURAGE.

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:57.946 region:rollup2
BUT IS NOT A CHOICE ANYMORE.

01:21:57.146 --> 01:21:59.248 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR CULTURE IS

01:21:57.946 --> 01:22:00.849 region:rollup2
WORKING WHEN IT MOSTLY RUNS ON

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:02.384 region:rollup2
ITSELF?

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:04.153 region:rollup2
HEALTHY CARD HEALTHY CULTURES

01:22:02.384 --> 01:22:06.021 region:rollup2

POLICIES AND SELF PERPETUATE.

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:13.662 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A

01:22:12.528 --> 01:22:15.164 region:rollup2
GOOD CULTURE.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:15.731 region:rollup2
IN THE END A HEALTHY CULTURE IS

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:17.933 region:rollup2
A COMPETITIVE GAME CHANGER

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:18.534 region:rollup2
ALLOWING YOU TO GET AND KEEP

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:20.169 region:rollup2
THE BEST PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:21.970 region:rollup2
MISSION.

01:22:20.169 --> 01:22:22.938 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.706 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE WREAKS HAVOC ON THE

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:26.708 region:rollup2
PAD BACK ON YOUR ABILITY. TO DO

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:28.644 region:rollup2
YOUR JOBS AS LEGISLATORS.

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:29.111 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THE SITUATION NEVER

01:22:28.644 --> 01:22:30.045 region:rollup2
REACHES THE LEVEL OF A

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:31.713 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT.

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:33.415 region:rollup2
BUT IT PUSHES GOOD PEOPLE OUT OF

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:35.818 region:rollup2
THE ORGANIZATION

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:37.019 region:rollup2
YOU'VE LOST THE TALENT GAY.

01:22:35.818 --> 01:22:37.986 region:rollup2
WITH CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:39.755 region:rollup2
RATE DOWN FOUR POINT NINE

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:41.390 region:rollup2
PERCENT AND FOLLOWING THIS IS A

01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:44.293 region:rollup2
RISK YOU SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD WE

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:45.661 region:rollup2
CAN'T LOSE STRONG PEOPLE.

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:46.428 region:rollup2
THIS BODY NOW HAS THE

01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:48.430 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM ITS

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:49.398 region:rollup2
CULTURE.

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:51.600 region:rollup2
AND AS THE BELLWETHER STATE FOR

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:52.534 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.336 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DO

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:55.537 region:rollup2
THIS WORK.

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:56.939 region:rollup2
AS YOU GO ABOUT THIS CRITICAL

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:57.439 region:rollup2
WORK THOUGH I URGE YOU TO

01:22:56.939 --> 01:22:59.241 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THAT COMPLIANCE

01:22:57.439 --> 01:23:00.976 region:rollup2
MATTERS.

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:03.679 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS HEALTHY CULTURE

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:04.880 region:rollup2
STAVES OFF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.814 region:rollup2

ME LOSING MY JOB THERE'S AN

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:31.239 region:rollup2

NOT SURE HOW PRACTICAL THAT IS

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:45.620 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU COULD

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:47.155 region:rollup2

AND WHEN YOU HAVE AN

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:43.411 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

01:29:41.176 --> 01:29:45.180 region:rollup2
WHERE?

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:47.716 region:rollup2
THE CULTURE HAS BEEN VERY

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.917 region:rollup2
POWERFUL THE PEOPLEWHO ARE AND

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:50.485 region:rollup2
HOW THE ABILITY TO USE THAT

VICTIM TO GO.

01:29:56.057 --> 01:30:00.228 region:rollup2
THERE HASN'T BEEN IN THE PAST

01:29:57.525 --> 01:30:01.896 region:rollup2
AND UNTIL WE SAW THE NEED TO DO

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:05.433 region:rollup2
TO WE SAW COURAGE BY.

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:07.836 region:rollup2
SOME VERY POWERFUL WOMEN IN IN

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:09.337 region:rollup2
IN FILM COME OUT AND AND STAND

01:30:07.836 --> 01:30:10.972 region:rollup2

WAS WRONG

01:30:10.972 --> 01:30:14.509 region:rollup2
WE SAW THEN.

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:15.710 region:rollup2
THIS CULTURE'S CHANGING NOW SO

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:18.079 region:rollup2
NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE WHO

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:20.081 region:rollup2
ARE OR WHO FEEL. EMPOWERED WHICH

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:21.416 region:rollup2
IS GREAT TO THE ARM.

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:23.551 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE PERPETRATORS THAT

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:25.854 region:rollup2
HAVE HAVE HAVE DONE WRONG. SO WE

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:27.489 region:rollup2
HAVE A CULTURE HERE THAT IS A

01:30:25.854 --> 01:30:29.190 region:rollup2
THAT THE PERPETRATORS HAVE NOT

01:30:27.489 --> 01:30:31.359 region:rollup2
BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:33.862 region:rollup2
AND THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:36.798 region:rollup2
SHOPPED AROUND OR IN SOME CASES.

01:30:33.862 --> 01:30:37.999 region:rollup2
NOT KNOW DUE DUE PROCESS SO

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:39.501 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA KILL YOU DID THIS

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:41.269 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE'S JOB.

01:30:39.501 --> 01:30:42.370 region:rollup2
IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CHANGE

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:43.838 region:rollup2
THAT CULTURE THAT YOU'VE BEEN

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:46.841 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT SO I WOULD BE

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:48.643 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN KNOWING.

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:50.412 region:rollup2
WORD TO WE WERE TO WE START AND

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:52.314 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE TRY TO MAKE THIS

01:30:50.412 --> 01:30:54.649 region:rollup2
CULTURE MOVE IN A DIRECTION

01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:56.017 region:rollup2
WHERE. THE VICTIM.

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:58.053 region:rollup2
DOES THAT THERE IS A SAFE PLACE

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:59.821 region:rollup2
TO GO.

01:30:58.053 --> 01:31:01.523 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THE

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:02.290 region:rollup2
PERPETRATORS.

01:31:01.523 --> 01:31:04.159 region:rollup2
AND WE TAKE THE POWER AWAY FROM

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:05.226 region:rollup2
POLITICIANS.

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:07.062 region:rollup2
OKAY BECAUSE THIS IS A POLITICAL

01:31:05.226 --> 01:31:09.397 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:10.098 region:rollup2
TO WEAR THAT'S NOT THAT THE FOX

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:12.367 region:rollup2
A.

01:31:10.098 --> 01:31:14.369 region:rollup2
GUARDING THE HENHOUSE FOR LACK

01:31:12.367 --> 01:31:15.971 region:rollup2
OF A BETTER TERM MAYBE.

01:31:14.369 --> 01:31:16.771 region:rollup2
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT NEW TO

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:18.506 region:rollup2
PUT ANOTHER LITTLE TWIST ON IT.

01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:19.975 region:rollup2
IS.

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:21.176 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE TWENTY

01:31:19.975 --> 01:31:23.144 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN

01:31:21.176 --> 01:31:24.846 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICE IS THE PEOPLE WHO

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:26.214 region:rollup2
AYE AYE AND WE SAW THIS AT THE

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.848 region:rollup2
LOCAL RAZA COUNTY SUPERVISOR WE

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:28.817 region:rollup2
HAD TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE.

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:31.219 region:rollup2
JEWISH AND.

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:32.554 region:rollup2
AND. I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:34.155 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT NEEDED TO GO GET

01:31:32.554 --> 01:31:34.656 region:rollup2
IN TROUBLE NEVER GOT IN TROUBLE

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:36.358 region:rollup2
AND THE ONES THAT JUST

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:39.027 region:rollup2
POLITICALLY GOT ACCUSED THAT

01:31:36.358 --> 01:31:40.995 region:rollup2
WERE INNOCENT. LOST THEIR JOB.

01:31:39.027 --> 01:31:42.664 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE A FINE LINE HERE

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:43.565 region:rollup2
WHERE.

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:45.633 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL

01:31:43.565 --> 01:31:47.335 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:48.670 region:rollup2
SO MANY CAN ACCUSE SOMEBODY AND

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:49.537 region:rollup2
IT CAN CHANGE THEIR CAREER EVEN

01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:51.106 region:rollup2
THOUGH THERE WAS MAYBE NO.

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:54.242 region:rollup2
.

01:31:51.106 --> 01:31:55.777 region:rollup2
A. REALITY TO IT SO I'M I WOULD

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:57.178 region:rollup2
BE ANY OF YOU COULD ANSWER A WE

WITH THIS THIS IS THE MAIN

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:01.983 region:rollup2
QUESTION FOR THIS THIS BODY.

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:05.086 region:rollup2
IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE.

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:07.222 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE VICTIM.

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:08.456 region:rollup2
BY ALL MEANS IF SOMEBODY'S.

01:32:07.222 --> 01:32:10.525 region:rollup2
BEEN GUILTY THROW THEM HECK OUT

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:12.360 region:rollup2
THIS PLACE.

01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:14.095 region:rollup2
AND AND NOT TOLERATE BUT THEN

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.964 region:rollup2
DRIVE THAT FINE LINE OF WHERE WE

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:17.032 region:rollup2
CHANGE THIS CULTURE HOW DO WE

01:32:15.964 --> 01:32:20.902 region:rollup2
START WHERE DO WE START THAT'S

01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:25.340 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M AFTER SO.

ANY TAKERS.

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:29.544 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY.

01:32:27.742 --> 01:32:30.912 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T ANY ONE THING YOU

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:32.614 region:rollup2
CAN DO THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:34.249 region:rollup2
THINGS YOU CAN DO.

01:32:32.614 --> 01:32:36.317 region:rollup2
I'M AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS

01:32:34.249 --> 01:32:39.120 region:rollup2
TO BEGIN DOING THEM.

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:40.955 region:rollup2
I AM I THINK THAT THE MOST

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.624 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY TO CHANGE.

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:44.659 region:rollup2
AND ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS TO

01:32:42.624 --> 01:32:46.928 region:rollup2
HAVE ONGOING INCLUSIVE

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:49.264 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS.

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:52.167 region:rollup2
I AM ABOUT WHAT CULTURAL NORMS

01:32:49.264 --> 01:32:53.868 region:rollup2
DO YOU WANT TO FOSTER.

01:32:52.167 --> 01:32:55.503 region:rollup2
NOT HOW'RE WE GONNA CATCH THE

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:57.539 region:rollup2
PERPETRATORS AND PUNISH THEM BUT

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:59.407 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF ORGANIZATIONAL

01:32:57.539 --> 01:33:01.476 region:rollup2
CLIMATE DO WE WANT.

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:03.812 region:rollup2
TO FOSTER.

01:33:01.476 --> 01:33:05.580 region:rollup2
I AM ALSO A BIG ADVOCATE OF OF

01:33:03.812 --> 01:33:07.115 region:rollup2
TYING THIS TO PUBLIC SERVICE

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:09.517 region:rollup2
VALUES.

01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:11.820 region:rollup2
WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:14.255 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE VERY BEST WORK.

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:15.190 region:rollup2
I AM I CONSIDER MYSELF A PART OF

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.891 region:rollup2
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PROCESS

01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:18.760 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH I'M JUST A TEACHER.

01:33:16.891 --> 01:33:20.128 region:rollup2
TO DO THE VERY BEST WORK TO

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.763 region:rollup2
BRING IN THE VERY BEST PEOPLE

01:33:20.128 --> 01:33:22.864 region:rollup2
AND GIVE THEM A WORKPLACE WHERE

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:24.666 region:rollup2
THEY CAN.

01:33:22.864 --> 01:33:26.301 region:rollup2
USE THEIR TALENTS WHERE THEY

01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:29.104 region:rollup2
CAN BE INNOVATIVE AND RESPONSIVE

01:33:26.301 --> 01:33:30.405 region:rollup2
AND RESILIENT.

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:32.474 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

01:33:30.405 --> 01:33:35.944 region:rollup2
.

01:33:32.474 --> 01:33:38.780 region:rollup2
THE THE CULTURAL NORMS OF SAFETY

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:41.249 region:rollup2
OF CIVILITY. OF TRUST OF

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.684 region:rollup2
COOPERATION OF COLLABORATION.

01:33:41.249 --> 01:33:44.552 region:rollup2
TARGET IS GONNA MAKE YOUR

01:33:42.684 --> 01:33:46.321 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION MORE INNOVATIVE IS

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:46.754 region:rollup2
GONNA MAKE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND

01:33:46.321 --> 01:33:48.123 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA MAKE IT.

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:49.424 region:rollup2
.

01:33:48.123 --> 01:33:51.126 region:rollup2
BUT MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE

01:33:49.424 --> 01:33:53.061 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO SIR.

01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:55.530 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S A PART OF A LARGER

01:33:53.061 --> 01:33:57.532 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND I WOULD SAY.

01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:59.367 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T AN HR ISSUE.

01:33:57.532 --> 01:34:00.969 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN ISSUE OF OF WHAT KIND

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:03.438 region:rollup2
OF INSTITUTION DOES

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:04.739 region:rollup2
DO YOU WANT THIS TO BE.

01:34:03.438 --> 01:34:07.008 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS TO BE TOP LEADERSHIP

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:08.476 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE EVERYONE SPEAKING TO

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:10.745 region:rollup2
THESE QUESTIONS.

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:11.813 region:rollup2
.

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:14.182 region:rollup2
AND YOU WANT THESE TO BEAT THE

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:15.416 region:rollup2
TRAINING IS GREAT EXCEPT FOR THE

01:34:14.182 --> 01:34:16.618 region:rollup2

01:35:54.816 --> 01:35:58.253 region:rollup2
THIS GO AWAY HERE SHE IS TO HE

POWERFUL.

01:36:00.722 --> 01:36:04.826 region:rollup2
TO A BIG GENERATED TOO MUCH

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:06.160 region:rollup2
CASTRO BOTTOM LINE AND SO YOU

01:36:04.826 --> 01:36:08.262 region:rollup2
CAN'T TELL PEOPLE WE HAVE THE

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:10.064 region:rollup2

KNOWS HIM.

01:36:19.207 --> 01:36:23.645 region:rollup2
UNTIL YOU START TAKING REAL

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:25.313 region:rollup2
ACTION WHEN PEOPLE SEE IT THEN

01:36:23.645 --> 01:36:27.348 region:rollup2
THEY WILL TRUST YOU AND THAT'S

01:36:25.313 --> 01:36:27.915 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING OF THE CULTURAL

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:29.150 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION IF THEY CAN'T

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:30.585 region:rollup2
TRUST YOU.

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:32.987 region:rollup2
THEY WILL NEVER BE SAFE ENOUGH

01:36:30.585 --> 01:36:34.122 region:rollup2
TO REPORT IT TO YOU SURELY

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:35.390 region:rollup2

ENOUGH TO BRING IT TO LIGHT.

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:46.134 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:47.168 region:rollup2
WILL MATTER ANYWAY THAT'S WHAT

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:48.536 region:rollup2
YOU ALL CAN DO A NIGHT AND I

01:36:47.168 --> 01:36:50.605 region:rollup2

MAKE A PUBLIC EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:56.711 region:rollup2
BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BAD

01:36:54.242 --> 01:36:57.345 region:rollup2
IDEA BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE SAW

01:36:56.711 --> 01:36:58.413 region:rollup2

01:36:57.345 --> 01:37:00.214 region:rollup2

MOST OF THEM ARE REALLY BAD.

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:56.904 region:rollup2

A CONFIDENTIAL SURVEY. THAT

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:06.114 region:rollup2

OF THEM.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:16.457 region:rollup2
HOW SURE ARE THEY?

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:18.192 region:rollup2

HARASSMENT ISSUES COME OUT SOME

01:43:54.495 --> 01:43:57.364 region:rollup2
RACE DISCRIMINATION SOME SAYS

ITS A VERY PRACTICAL WAY BUT ONE

01:44:01.102 --> 01:44:04.305 region:rollup2
OF THE DANGERS.

01:44:02.703 --> 01:44:07.241 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE TELL PEOPLE WHAT WE

01:44:04.305 --> 01:44:09.009 region:rollup2
ASPIRE WHAT WE WANT OUR VALUES

01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:10.411 region:rollup2

PLEASE LEAVE AGREE WITH THAT.

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:26.894 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY THAT ONCE

01:44:24.792 --> 01:44:28.529 region:rollup2
YOU'VE ONCE YOU GO TO EMPLOYEES

01:44:26.894 --> 01:44:30.264 region:rollup2
AND ASK THEM ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW

01:44:28.529 --> 01:44:32.333 region:rollup2
WHAT AT THAT BUT WHAT DESCRIBES

01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:34.468 region:rollup2
YOUR WORKPLACE. TO THEN GO BACK

TO THEM AFTER YOU COLLECT THAT

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:36.537 region:rollup2

ALL THE STATE AND SAY WELL NO

01:44:42.476 --> 01:44:45.312 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT AND

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:46.580 region:rollup2
THESE ARE GONNA BE THE VALUES IF

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:48.549 region:rollup2
YOU GO BACK TO THOSE SAME

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:51.619 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND SAY. OKAY WHAT

AND IT TAKES I AM IN THE.

01:44:54.355 --> 01:44:56.757 region:rollup2
WE DO NEXT.

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:58.292 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE STUDY IN THE CITY OF

01:44:56.757 --> 01:44:59.827 region:rollup2
PHOENIX AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE

01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:01.529 region:rollup2
PROCESS THEY FOLLOWED.

01:44:59.827 --> 01:45:04.298 region:rollup2
THEY WENT BACK AND THEY CAME UP

01:45:01.529 --> 01:45:05.099 region:rollup2
WITH SEVEN STATEMENTS OF VALUE.

01:45:04.298 --> 01:45:05.933 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR

01:45:05.099 --> 01:45:08.202 region:rollup2
DOOR.

01:45:05.933 --> 01:45:10.337 region:rollup2
BUT IT WAS IT WAS.

01:45:08.202 --> 01:45:12.339 region:rollup2
IT WAS A PROCESS WHERE EVERY

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:14.742 region:rollup2
SINGLE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATED IN

01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:16.811 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:45:14.742 --> 01:45:19.246 region:rollup2
UP SOME FASHION.

01:45:16.811 --> 01:45:19.780 region:rollup2
AND THEN ONCE THOSE VALUES WERE

01:45:19.246 --> 01:45:20.748 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED THAT WERE PUT

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:22.483 region:rollup2
EVERYWHERE.

01:45:20.748 --> 01:45:24.185 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU AND THEN THEY USED.

01:45:22.483 --> 01:45:25.519 region:rollup2
.

01:45:24.185 --> 01:45:27.488 region:rollup2
THEY USED EXAMPLES AND STORIES

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:28.322 region:rollup2
TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THOSE VALUES

01:45:27.488 --> 01:45:29.723 region:rollup2
WERE PUTTING BEING PUT INTO

01:45:28.322 --> 01:45:31.892 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:45:29.723 --> 01:45:33.727 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD SAY IF YOU IF YOU

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:35.896 region:rollup2
WANT A LIST OF THINGS TO DO.

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:37.398 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY COLLECT DATA I LIKE

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:39.233 region:rollup2
YOUR IDEA OF OF SPEAKING

01:45:37.398 --> 01:45:41.402 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO EMPLOYEES.

01:45:39.233 --> 01:45:43.170 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SURVEYS ARE OKAY BUT I

01:45:41.402 --> 01:45:44.905 region:rollup2
BUT I AM I THINK CONVERSATION

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:46.807 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT IS BETTER.

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:47.508 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:45:46.807 --> 01:45:49.143 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:45:47.508 --> 01:45:50.978 region:rollup2
STRUCTURALLY ARE EXCELLENT.

01:45:49.143 --> 01:45:52.713 region:rollup2
COMING UP WITH A JOINT PROCESS

01:45:50.978 --> 01:45:54.849 region:rollup2
FOR REPORTING PROVIDING THE

01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:56.550 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR ON

01:45:54.849 --> 01:45:57.651 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO COME FORWARD ALSO

01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:59.019 region:rollup2
PROVIDING A SUPPORTIVE

01:45:57.651 --> 01:45:59.620 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT COUNSELING FOR

01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:00.855 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:01.088 region:rollup2
DO.

01:46:00.855 --> 01:46:03.357 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:04.725 region:rollup2
OF.

01:46:03.357 --> 01:46:07.895 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT.

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:08.662 region:rollup2
.

01:46:07.895 --> 01:46:10.164 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:12.933 region:rollup2
IS IS GOOD.

01:46:10.164 --> 01:46:14.969 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT'S.

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:16.237 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PPL DON'T DO ANYTHING

01:46:14.969 --> 01:46:16.770 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING BECAUSE

01:46:16.237 --> 01:46:18.072 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:20.140 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:46:18.072 --> 01:46:21.909 region:rollup2
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:24.211 region:rollup2
HOW TO BE PROACTIVE HOW TO BE

01:46:21.909 --> 01:46:25.713 region:rollup2
POSITIVE IN THIS AREA AND THAT

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:29.083 region:rollup2
CAN BE VERY VERY HELPFUL.

01:46:25.713 --> 01:46:31.085 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU WANNA ENCOURAGE.

01:46:29.083 --> 01:46:32.052 region:rollup2
EVERYWHERE AND AND AND AND YOU

01:46:31.085 --> 01:46:34.054 region:rollup2
KNOW IT THIS ISN'T JUST A

01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:36.457 region:rollup2
WOMEN'S ISSUE MAN ARCTIC JUST

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:37.891 region:rollup2
THE ONLY PERPETRATORS BUT MATTER

01:46:36.457 --> 01:46:41.228 region:rollup2
CONFUSED.

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:43.163 region:rollup2
INTO MY SONS ARE CONFUSED.

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:43.998 region:rollup2
UP TO THIS IS NOT. THIS ISN'T

01:46:43.163 --> 01:46:46.867 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED

01:46:43.998 --> 01:46:48.469 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT AND WE ALL NEED HELP

01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:50.638 region:rollup2
IN HOW TO IN EIGHTEEN HOW TO BE

01:46:48.469 --> 01:46:52.373 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOW TO LISTEN AND HOW

01:46:50.638 --> 01:46:54.341 region:rollup2
TO BEHAVE. AND AGAIN THIS ISN'T

01:46:52.373 --> 01:46:55.376 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:46:54.341 --> 01:46:56.677 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T ABOUT CRIMINAL

01:46:55.376 --> 01:46:59.947 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY IS ABOUT MAKING THE

01:46:56.677 --> 01:47:00.714 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION BETTER.

01:46:59.947 --> 01:47:02.216 region:rollup2
BUT THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:04.718 region:rollup2
TO AFFECTS OUR STATE IS NOT

01:47:02.216 --> 01:47:06.720 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEX EITHER. OUR POWER

01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:08.188 region:rollup2
GRIDS WITH THAT YEAH THE OTHER

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:09.356 region:rollup2
THING AB SEES IN THE MISSING

01:47:08.188 --> 01:47:10.858 region:rollup2
ELEMENT THOUGH IS ONCE YOU COME

01:47:09.356 --> 01:47:12.593 region:rollup2
UP WITH THESE VALUES AND WE PUT

01:47:10.858 --> 01:47:14.628 region:rollup2
THEM UP SO COMING UP THE RIGHT

01:47:12.593 --> 01:47:16.830 region:rollup2
SAID IS IMPORTANT AS WE'VE JUST

01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:17.264 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED. BUT THEN YOU GOT IT

01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:18.065 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HOLD PEOPLE

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:19.233 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:47:18.065 --> 01:47:20.567 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IF THEIR BEHAVIORS

01:47:19.233 --> 01:47:22.303 region:rollup2
IF YOU SAY FOR EXAMPLE WE VALUE

01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:23.904 region:rollup2
OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY

01:47:22.303 --> 01:47:25.472 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY ARE EXAMPLES BEFORE

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:26.974 region:rollup2
YOU GET TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:47:25.472 --> 01:47:28.809 region:rollup2
WORKED OF RACE DISCRIMINATION

01:47:26.974 --> 01:47:30.244 region:rollup2
ANY. WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:33.013 region:rollup2
DON'T LIVE BY THOSE VALUES

01:47:30.244 --> 01:47:34.315 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT TO EXPEL THEM.

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:36.116 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST NO OTHER WAY TO DO

01:47:34.315 --> 01:47:37.718 region:rollup2
IT AND YOU CAN'T DO IT SUBTLY

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:39.453 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS SO SUBTLE AND

01:47:37.718 --> 01:47:41.088 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY OF

01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:43.457 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL MATTERS NEEDING TO.

01:47:41.088 --> 01:47:44.758 region:rollup2
HELD CONFIDENTIAL IF PEOPLE

01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:45.659 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW WHY THE PERSON IS

01:47:44.758 --> 01:47:46.994 region:rollup2
HELD THEY MAY HAVE BUT PERSON

01:47:45.659 --> 01:47:48.963 region:rollup2
JUST GOT ANOTHER JOB. WE DON'T

01:47:46.994 --> 01:47:51.999 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THEY'RE NOT MAKING

01:47:48.963 --> 01:47:54.101 region:rollup2
THE CONNECTION BECAUSE WE GO TO

01:47:51.999 --> 01:47:55.102 region:rollup2
SUCH LENGTHS TO HIDE IT.

01:47:54.101 --> 01:47:56.437 region:rollup2
SO PART OF IT IS IF YOU'RE GOING

01:47:55.102 --> 01:47:58.572 region:rollup2
TO SEE THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO

01:47:56.437 --> 01:48:00.240 region:rollup2
WORK HERE AND IF YOU DON'T LIVE

01:47:58.572 --> 01:48:02.142 region:rollup2
WITH THEM THIS NO MORE. YOU ARE

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:03.644 region:rollup2
VOTED OFF THE ISLAND PEOPLE HAVE

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:04.845 region:rollup2
TO KNOW THAT THE PERSON IS VOTED

01:48:03.644 --> 01:48:06.680 region:rollup2
OFF THE ISLAND FOR THAT AGAIN

01:48:04.845 --> 01:48:08.415 region:rollup2
WITHOUT DISCLOSING HIGHLY HIGHLY

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.950 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BUT

01:48:08.415 --> 01:48:11.151 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE DISCONNECTED WE HEAR

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:12.953 region:rollup2
THAT FROM EMPLOYEES ALL THE TIME

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:15.155 region:rollup2
WE KIND OF QUIETLYLET SOMEONE

01:48:12.953 --> 01:48:17.958 region:rollup2
GO AWAY. AND SO THE PEOPLE WHO

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:19.193 region:rollup2
WAITING TO BELIEVE IN YOU.

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:20.928 region:rollup2
DON'T UNDERSTAND ATTRACT DID

01:48:19.193 --> 01:48:22.563 region:rollup2
YOUR JOB THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW

01:48:20.928 --> 01:48:25.332 region:rollup2
THAT THE JOB WAS DONE AND SO YOU

01:48:22.563 --> 01:48:25.899 region:rollup2
DON'T GET. PEOPLE TO COME FOR TO

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:27.067 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S CRITICAL IN THE

01:48:25.899 --> 01:48:27.935 region:rollup2
LAST.

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:30.404 region:rollup2
POINT THAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO

01:48:27.935 --> 01:48:31.872 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THIS TOO OFTEN WE

01:48:30.404 --> 01:48:33.007 region:rollup2
SAY THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:36.877 region:rollup2
YOU LITERALLY MADE IT WELL THIS

01:48:33.007 --> 01:48:38.579 region:rollup2

SAME THING WITH YOUR HUMAN

RESOURCES?

01:48:54.528 --> 01:48:59.133 region:rollup2
AND SO IF YOU SIMPLY TAKE YOUR

HR FUNCTION AS A PERSONNEL

01:48:59.133 --> 01:49:01.835 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AN ADMINISTRATIVE

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.736 region:rollup2
FUNCTION PEOPLE WHO YOU GOT OUT

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:04.671 region:rollup2
OF THE OUT THIS PAPERWORK TO GET

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:06.907 region:rollup2

AND KEEPERS OF CULTURE.

01:49:11.245 --> 01:49:14.415 region:rollup2
I JUST WANTED DAY AND ONE BRIEF

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:15.616 region:rollup2
POINT WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT

01:49:14.415 --> 01:49:16.650 region:rollup2
ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW TO

01:49:15.616 --> 01:49:18.118 region:rollup2
HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WITH A

01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:20.854 region:rollup2
SWIFT ACTION WHEN THEY DON'T

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:22.823 region:rollup2
LIVE OUR VALUES. I JUST WANNA

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:24.925 region:rollup2
KIND OF HIGHLY THAT IT'S ALSO

01:49:22.823 --> 01:49:26.760 region:rollup2
EQUALLY IMPORTANT SAID RECOGNIZE

01:49:24.925 --> 01:49:27.828 region:rollup2
AND REWARD PEOPLE COULD DO. AND

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.397 region:rollup2
I THINK SOMETIMES THAT GETS

01:49:27.828 --> 01:49:33.634 region:rollup2
MISSED IN THIS DISCUSSION BUT.

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:35.502 region:rollup2
Y. TO REALLY LIVE YOUR VALUES

01:49:33.634 --> 01:49:36.470 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO BOTH HOLD PEOPLE

01:49:35.502 --> 01:49:39.373 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY ACT

01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:41.241 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THEM. AND ELEVATE

01:49:39.373 --> 01:49:42.876 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ACT INSIDE OF THEM

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:44.711 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE EVERYONE SEES YOU

01:49:42.876 --> 01:49:47.081 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING AND REWARDING PEOPLE

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:49.850 region:rollup2
THAT ARE INCLUSIVE PEOPLE THAT

01:49:47.081 --> 01:49:53.654 region:rollup2
ARE THREE. PEOPLE THAT GIVE

01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:55.289 region:rollup2
OTHERS THE FLOOR PEOPLE THAT

01:49:53.654 --> 01:49:56.890 region:rollup2
INVITE OTHERS IN.

01:49:55.289 --> 01:49:58.258 region:rollup2
CREATING INCLUSIVE CULTURE

01:49:56.890 --> 01:50:01.929 region:rollup2
REQUIRES BOTH THAT CARROT AND

01:49:58.258 --> 01:50:03.163 region:rollup2
STICK APPROACH ON.

01:50:01.929 --> 01:50:04.231 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL I WENT BACK AT THE NORTH

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:05.065 region:rollup2
FOR THIRTY BUT I THINK THAT

01:50:04.231 --> 01:50:05.799 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY REALLY KEEPS YOU.

01:50:05.065 --> 01:50:06.467 region:rollup2
I JUST I JUST WANTED TO ADD.

01:50:05.799 --> 01:50:07.401 region:rollup2
.

01:50:06.467 --> 01:50:07.801 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR POINT ABOUT

01:50:07.401 --> 01:50:08.869 region:rollup2
THE SWIFT ACTION.

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:09.403 region:rollup2
.

01:50:08.869 --> 01:50:10.571 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ELECTED

01:50:09.403 --> 01:50:11.071 region:rollup2
OFFICIAL OR A OR A FACULTY

01:50:10.571 --> 01:50:12.272 region:rollup2
MEMBER WITH.

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:13.607 region:rollup2
LIFETIME TENURE THAT SWIFT

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:14.775 region:rollup2
ACTION IS NOT QUITE AS EASY AS.

01:50:13.607 --> 01:50:15.109 region:rollup2
FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES SO I THINK

01:50:14.775 --> 01:50:16.076 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE.

01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:16.577 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:50:16.076 --> 01:50:17.344 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT TERMS OF

01:50:16.577 --> 01:50:18.212 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY ARE REALLY

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:19.580 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT I'M GIVING COMPLIANCE

01:50:18.212 --> 01:50:22.483 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:24.151 region:rollup2
DONE WHAT YOU CAN DO. AND

01:50:22.483 --> 01:50:25.586 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY WILL WILL.

01:50:24.151 --> 01:50:27.754 region:rollup2
OFTEN FOLLOW THE CULTURE RIGHT

01:50:25.586 --> 01:50:29.456 region:rollup2
SO IN THE IN THE YOU SEE YOU'VE

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:31.291 region:rollup2
HAD THE PIERCED THE FACULTY

01:50:29.456 --> 01:50:32.159 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THEMSELVES STARTING TO

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:33.427 region:rollup2
HOLD THEIR COLLEAGUES

01:50:32.159 --> 01:50:34.695 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE AND WE HAVE TO DO

01:50:33.427 --> 01:50:36.430 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE FACULTY

01:50:34.695 --> 01:50:38.565 region:rollup2
WHO.

01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:39.266 region:rollup2
A PLAN THEMSELVES ON SOME LEVEL

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:41.135 region:rollup2
IN THE UC.

01:50:39.266 --> 01:50:42.169 region:rollup2
SO THEY HAVE TO BUY INTO THIS

01:50:41.135 --> 01:50:42.669 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY'RE GOING TO HOLD

01:50:42.169 --> 01:50:44.972 region:rollup2
THEIR COLLEAGUES

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:46.406 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:50:44.972 --> 01:50:48.075 region:rollup2
WHAT QUESTIONS SHOULD BE I MEAN

01:50:46.406 --> 01:50:50.010 region:rollup2
IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT'S THE WAY

01:50:48.075 --> 01:50:51.645 region:rollup2
IT IS BUT THAT'S NOT OKAY TO SAY

01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:52.212 region:rollup2
WHAT WE TREAT THESE PEOPLE

01:50:51.645 --> 01:50:54.148 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:55.949 region:rollup2
TENURE THAT'S RIDICULOUS IF YOU

01:50:54.148 --> 01:50:57.618 region:rollup2
ARE A? CREDIT OR YOU ARE A

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:59.453 region:rollup2
PREDATOR AND WE SHOULD NOT

01:50:57.618 --> 01:51:01.188 region:rollup2
ACCEPT EFFECT YOU SHOULD BE HELD

SUBMIT TO YOU THAT YOUR JOB

01:53:35.976 --> 01:53:39.012 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:41.048 region:rollup2
.

01:53:39.012 --> 01:53:42.516 region:rollup2
IN MAKING SURE S. COLLINS WOULD

01:53:41.048 --> 01:53:44.384 region:rollup2

OUR OWN HR FUNCTIONS.

01:53:46.219 --> 01:53:50.624 region:rollup2
IF WE.

01:53:48.255 --> 01:53:52.559 region:rollup2

01:53:50.624 --> 01:53:54.127 region:rollup2
THEIR JOB STATEMENTS DEVELOP

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:56.229 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT. THAT'S

01:53:54.127 --> 01:53:57.864 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FOR WHAT WE NEED

01:53:56.229 --> 01:54:00.634 region:rollup2

HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THE ASSEMBLY

NATURE TO WHAT THEY DO IT'S VERY

01:55:38.732 --> 01:55:41.768 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE IMMENSE NOT IN

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.237 region:rollup2

USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES YOU KNOW

ICON LOOKING AYE ABLE THING. AND

01:59:08.241 --> 01:59:10.276 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEONE POSTS SOMETHING

01:59:09.776 --> 01:59:12.779 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

01:59:10.276 --> 01:59:14.080 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:59:12.779 --> 01:59:16.249 region:rollup2
IT SHOWS AND TOLERANCE YOU KNOW

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:17.984 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE ANY NOT JUST SEXUAL

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:19.986 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE RACIAL INTOLERANCE

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:20.887 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. AGAINST THE

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:23.123 region:rollup2
TRANSGENDER PERSON.

01:59:20.887 --> 01:59:24.724 region:rollup2
OR AGE OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT

01:59:23.123 --> 01:59:25.225 region:rollup2
IS.

01:59:24.724 --> 01:59:27.193 region:rollup2
A RACIALLY MOTIVATED OR

01:59:25.225 --> 01:59:28.595 region:rollup2
CULTURAL.

01:59:27.193 --> 01:59:30.296 region:rollup2
THEY CAN PUT THAT.

01:59:28.595 --> 01:59:31.498 region:rollup2
ICON.

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:33.967 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SAYS SOMEONE'S

01:59:31.498 --> 01:59:35.368 region:rollup2
WATCHING YOUR PEERS OR WATCHING

01:59:33.967 --> 01:59:37.203 region:rollup2
AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE JOIN IN

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:39.272 region:rollup2
WITH THAT. AND THEN THAT PERSON

01:59:37.203 --> 01:59:40.440 region:rollup2
IS ISOLATED IN THE ONE WHO DID

01:59:39.272 --> 01:59:42.809 region:rollup2
IT IN THAT MAYBE THEY'LL SAY

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:44.110 region:rollup2
WELL YOU KNOW I.

01:59:42.809 --> 01:59:45.678 region:rollup2
OFTEN DO THAT ANYMORE THIS THING

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:48.681 region:rollup2
GET THE RESPONSE THAT I WANTED.

01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:50.316 region:rollup2
.

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:51.217 region:rollup2
I THINK AND AND.

01:59:50.316 --> 01:59:53.286 region:rollup2
WHEN ONE OF OUR OTHER HEARINGS

01:59:51.217 --> 01:59:54.854 region:rollup2
THE ONE OF THE ATTORNEY GROUPS

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:57.123 region:rollup2
HAD TALKED ABOUT. THAT PEER

01:59:54.854 --> 01:59:59.826 region:rollup2
CULTURE IN A WORKPLACE.

01:59:57.123 --> 02:00:01.161 region:rollup2
AND.

01:59:59.826 --> 02:00:03.730 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S SO IMPORTANT

02:00:01.161 --> 02:00:05.365 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DO A LOT OF

02:00:03.730 --> 02:00:07.767 region:rollup2
THINGS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:00:05.365 --> 02:00:09.602 region:rollup2
OUR STAFF SO WITH US. WE GO TO

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:11.438 region:rollup2
RECEPTIONS OFF SITE WHERE IT

02:00:09.602 --> 02:00:13.206 region:rollup2
MEETINGS WERE ACT SOCIAL

02:00:11.438 --> 02:00:15.041 region:rollup2
GATHERINGS IN OUR DISTRICTS

02:00:13.206 --> 02:00:17.310 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:18.311 region:rollup2
FROM THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS. YOU

02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:20.513 region:rollup2
KNOW STAFF AT ALL LEVELS.

02:00:18.311 --> 02:00:22.882 region:rollup2
AND.

02:00:20.513 --> 02:00:24.551 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SEE THINGS THEY MAY

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:27.320 region:rollup2
QUESTION OR THEY THINK THAT'S

02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:29.489 region:rollup2
NOT APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW HOW DO

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:31.491 region:rollup2
WE BE ABLE IS THERE. THE ABILITY

02:00:29.489 --> 02:00:33.493 region:rollup2
OR HAS THAT BEEN DEVELOPING IN

02:00:31.491 --> 02:00:36.229 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF ISSUE. IN THE

02:00:33.493 --> 02:00:38.631 region:rollup2
CORPORATE SETTING TAKING IT FROM

02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:40.200 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE DONE IN EDUCATION.

02:00:38.631 --> 02:00:42.235 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW PEERS TO START TO SAY.

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:44.270 region:rollup2
.

02:00:42.235 --> 02:00:46.606 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE.

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:48.408 region:rollup2
OR REMINDING SOMEONE YOU KNOW WE

02:00:46.606 --> 02:00:49.876 region:rollup2
SAW WHAT YOU DID OR.

02:00:48.408 --> 02:00:52.679 region:rollup2
USING TECHNOLOGY EVEN

02:00:49.876 --> 02:00:54.047 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE.

02:00:52.679 --> 02:00:55.014 region:rollup2
YEAH BIT WILL NOT ALLOWING IT TO

02:00:54.047 --> 02:00:57.117 region:rollup2
PROGRESS

02:00:55.014 --> 02:00:58.318 region:rollup2
LIKE IT HAPPENS.

02:00:57.117 --> 02:01:00.420 region:rollup2
AN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVEN

02:00:58.318 --> 02:01:01.788 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT IS BEING USED IN

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:04.491 region:rollup2
MODERN.

02:01:01.788 --> 02:01:05.425 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:01:04.491 --> 02:01:08.261 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY PART

02:01:05.425 --> 02:01:09.395 region:rollup2
OF HOW WE DEVELOPED CULTURE.

02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:10.997 region:rollup2
MISS EVERYONE WE HAVE LIKE WE

02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:12.432 region:rollup2
SAID YOUNG STAFF YOUNG INTERN

02:01:10.997 --> 02:01:15.668 region:rollup2
SERVED.

02:01:12.432 --> 02:01:18.738 region:rollup2
ROLL UP I MEAN.

02:01:15.668 --> 02:01:19.005 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I HAVE TO ASK MY SON

02:01:18.738 --> 02:01:21.441 region:rollup2
HOW TO FIX

02:01:19.005 --> 02:01:23.910 region:rollup2
MY OPINION THINGS HE CAN DO IT.

02:01:21.441 --> 02:01:25.245 region:rollup2
TO INVEST TWO SECONDS. SO.

02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:26.246 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO

02:01:25.245 --> 02:01:28.114 region:rollup2
STOP OUR.

02:01:26.246 --> 02:01:30.049 region:rollup2
IN ON.

02:01:28.114 --> 02:01:30.383 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVEN.

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:32.685 region:rollup2
ON THE TABLE.

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:33.653 region:rollup2
.

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:35.288 region:rollup2
FOR I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT

02:01:33.653 --> 02:01:37.090 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE

02:01:35.288 --> 02:01:37.924 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH A LOT OF INNOVATIVE

02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:39.893 region:rollup2
PURER.

02:01:37.924 --> 02:01:40.760 region:rollup2
SELF GOVERNING IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:01:39.893 --> 02:01:42.362 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT.

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:44.497 region:rollup2
.

02:01:42.362 --> 02:01:46.699 region:rollup2
REPORTING OPTIONS FOR YOUNGER

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:47.801 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO DON'T FEEL EMPOWERED.

02:01:46.699 --> 02:01:49.936 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF TECH THERE'S

02:01:47.801 --> 02:01:51.638 region:rollup2
WIDE ABSENT TECHNOLOGY FOR SORT

02:01:49.936 --> 02:01:53.039 region:rollup2

COLLEGES ARE STARTING TO USE

WHICH MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.578 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY

02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:58.778 region:rollup2
GOOD IDEA. BUT ALSO TO YOUR

02:01:58.578 --> 02:01:59.946 region:rollup2
POINT.

02:01:58.778 --> 02:02:01.714 region:rollup2
.

02:01:59.946 --> 02:02:04.317 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT YOUR PEERS AND IF

02:02:01.714 --> 02:02:04.951 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT USING TECHNOLOGY.

02:02:04.317 --> 02:02:06.386 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN

02:02:04.951 --> 02:02:08.421 region:rollup2
HOLD?

02:02:06.386 --> 02:02:09.088 region:rollup2

02:02:09.088 --> 02:02:11.824 region:rollup2
THE FACULTY NOT THAT WE WERE

02:02:10.323 --> 02:02:13.760 region:rollup2
PLAYING A DIFFERENT STANDARD.

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:15.995 region:rollup2
FOR DISCIPLINING THEM AS MUCH

02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:17.730 region:rollup2
AS IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE.

02:02:15.995 --> 02:02:20.833 region:rollup2
OUR OWN PEERS HOLD US

02:02:17.730 --> 02:02:22.869 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE. MY YEAH WHAT WAS

02:02:20.833 --> 02:02:23.903 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ANTINAUSEA SINCE

02:02:22.869 --> 02:02:25.838 region:rollup2

02:02:30.577 --> 02:02:34.247 region:rollup2
NOTICES THEIR SAFETY THREAT.

02:02:32.779 --> 02:02:35.682 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS BUT

02:02:34.247 --> 02:02:37.550 region:rollup2
I THINK SEXUAL HARASSMENT COULD

02:02:35.682 --> 02:02:38.685 region:rollup2
BE PART OF THAT THERE ARE AND

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:39.953 region:rollup2
THERE THERE ARE ALSO

02:02:38.685 --> 02:02:41.554 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS THAT.

02:02:39.953 --> 02:02:42.789 region:rollup2
WOULD COLLECT

02:02:41.554 --> 02:02:44.691 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF TIME SOMEONE

02:02:42.789 --> 02:02:46.459 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ONE REPORT. ON BECAUSE

02:02:44.691 --> 02:02:48.361 region:rollup2
THEY THINK A WELL IT'S JUST I

02:02:46.459 --> 02:02:49.429 region:rollup2
PROBABLY IMAGINED IT OR MAYBE

02:02:48.361 --> 02:02:50.997 region:rollup2
I'M MAKING TOO BIG A DEAL OUT OF

02:02:49.429 --> 02:02:52.098 region:rollup2
THIS BUT IF THEY KNOW THAT THE

02:02:50.997 --> 02:02:53.666 region:rollup2
PERSON HAS DONE IT TO SOMEONE

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:55.335 region:rollup2
ELSE. THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:56.603 region:rollup2
TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT SO

02:02:55.335 --> 02:02:59.005 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

02:02:56.603 --> 02:03:00.807 region:rollup2
COLLECTING. REPORTS.

02:02:59.005 --> 02:03:02.308 region:rollup2
ON THE CONDITION OF HE LET ME

02:03:00.807 --> 02:03:03.810 region:rollup2
KNOW IF SOMEONE ELSE REPORTS

02:03:02.308 --> 02:03:05.044 region:rollup2
THIS PERSON AS WELL AND NOT

02:03:03.810 --> 02:03:08.615 region:rollup2
WOULD CHANGE.

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:09.649 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEIR DECISION MAKING.

02:03:08.615 --> 02:03:11.551 region:rollup2
S. WATCHIN IT'S INTERESTING HOW

02:03:09.649 --> 02:03:12.952 region:rollup2
WAS THAT AND IN ONE OF MY LAST

02:03:11.551 --> 02:03:14.420 region:rollup2
LIVES NOT PROTECT THE NAME OF

02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:16.256 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY BUT WE HAVE THE

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:18.057 region:rollup2
ABILITY THESE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY

02:03:16.256 --> 02:03:19.359 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY MONITOR WHAT OUR

02:03:18.057 --> 02:03:21.261 region:rollup2
YOUNG. ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES A

02:03:19.359 --> 02:03:23.229 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE YOUNG

EMPLOYEES AND THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA

02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:26.299 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY FOR SECURITY REASONS.

02:03:25.465 --> 02:03:27.734 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:03:26.299 --> 02:03:29.502 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT THAT WE THINK OF

02:03:27.734 --> 02:03:31.004 region:rollup2
USING THESE TOOLS FOR PURPOSES

02:03:29.502 --> 02:03:31.938 region:rollup2
OF SORT OF HOW DO YOU REPORT

02:03:31.004 --> 02:03:33.907 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT RACE

02:03:31.938 --> 02:03:35.308 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION ETCETERA. WHAT WE

02:03:33.907 --> 02:03:36.709 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT WAS A SHOCK TO WISH

02:03:35.308 --> 02:03:37.777 region:rollup2
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT CULTURE

02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:39.612 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE WAYS THEY SPOKE TO

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:42.215 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER?

02:03:39.612 --> 02:03:44.017 region:rollup2
OKAY SO WE HAD AND WE LITERALLY

02:03:42.215 --> 02:03:46.319 region:rollup2
WOULD CALL IN AND SEE IT. IF

02:03:44.017 --> 02:03:47.320 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MALE EMPLOYEE HAD SET

02:03:46.319 --> 02:03:48.922 region:rollup2
THIS TO YOU IN THE WORKPLACE

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:50.556 region:rollup2
YOU'D BE AN HR.

02:03:48.922 --> 02:03:52.926 region:rollup2
HAVE A DISCUSSION YOU REFERRED

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:54.227 region:rollup2
TO ANOTHER WOMAN FELLOW EMPLOYEE

02:03:52.926 --> 02:03:55.261 region:rollup2
USE THAT THE WORD THIS WORD THAT

02:03:54.227 --> 02:03:56.963 region:rollup2
WORD.

02:03:55.261 --> 02:03:59.399 region:rollup2
AND SO WE SAID YOU ARE

02:03:56.963 --> 02:04:01.301 region:rollup2
DESENSITIZING THE ORGANIZATION

02:03:59.399 --> 02:04:02.936 region:rollup2
TO AND IT'S IT'S NOT THAT YOU DO

02:04:01.301 --> 02:04:03.803 region:rollup2
THIS AFTER HOURS BECAUSE THAT'S

02:04:02.936 --> 02:04:05.338 region:rollup2
NOT A DIFFERENCE EVERYONE WORKS

02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:07.206 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR HOURS NOW. YOU KNOW

02:04:05.338 --> 02:04:08.741 region:rollup2

02:04:07.206 --> 02:04:10.276 region:rollup2
THIS IS YOUR MIND SAID THIS IS

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:11.945 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE

02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:13.780 region:rollup2
CULTURE AND SO YOUR POINT'S WELL

02:04:11.945 --> 02:04:15.682 region:rollup2
TAKEN BUT I JUST DON'T WANT IT

02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:16.616 region:rollup2
TO BE I DON'T THINK FROM HR

02:04:15.682 --> 02:04:18.751 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE. THAT WE CAN

02:04:16.616 --> 02:04:19.485 region:rollup2
COMPARTMENTALIZE PEOPLE'S LIVES

02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:21.454 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT THE IDEA THAT YOU

02:04:19.485 --> 02:04:22.956 region:rollup2
ALLOW. MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES

02:04:21.454 --> 02:04:25.224 region:rollup2
REALLY ENGAGED IN SOME TERRIBLY

02:04:22.956 --> 02:04:27.327 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE AND DIVISIVE

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:28.494 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ONLINE AND THEY

02:04:27.327 --> 02:04:30.997 region:rollup2
THINK I'M DOING THIS ON MY UP TO

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:33.299 region:rollup2
MY OWN TIME ON MY HOME COMPUTER

02:04:30.997 --> 02:04:35.435 region:rollup2
DATA DOT. WILL. FAST FORWARD

02:04:33.299 --> 02:04:38.037 region:rollup2
THEY BRING THOSE MIND SETS ENACT

02:04:35.435 --> 02:04:38.805 region:rollup2
CULTURAL THINKING TO WORK AND

02:04:38.037 --> 02:04:40.406 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO WAY TO

02:04:38.805 --> 02:04:41.774 region:rollup2
COMPARTMENTALIZE IT DESPITE THE

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:43.643 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN.

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:45.044 region:rollup2
AND BY THE WAY IF YOUR COLLEAGUE

02:04:43.643 --> 02:04:46.346 region:rollup2
SAW IT

02:04:45.044 --> 02:04:47.547 region:rollup2
AND YOUR COLLEAGUE YOU KNOW.

02:04:46.346 --> 02:04:49.115 region:rollup2
THEY MAY TREAT YOU DIFFERENTLY

02:04:47.547 --> 02:04:50.717 region:rollup2
AT WORK AS A RESULT OF IT SO

02:04:49.115 --> 02:04:52.151 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS IS AND I WISH YOU

02:04:50.717 --> 02:04:53.519 region:rollup2
KNOW WAS HERE IT IS A BROADER

02:04:52.151 --> 02:04:55.421 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

02:04:53.519 --> 02:04:57.490 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHO IS IT THAT WE BRING

02:04:55.421 --> 02:05:00.293 region:rollup2
INTO OUR ORGANIZATION NOT JUST

02:04:57.490 --> 02:05:01.461 region:rollup2
THEIR BEHAVIOR YOU KNOW AT WORK

WE INFLUENCE HOW THE GROW UP.

02:05:08.968 --> 02:05:10.570 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S THE

02:05:09.936 --> 02:05:12.705 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE HIGHER IT

02:05:10.570 --> 02:05:14.474 region:rollup2

WHAT HAS OCCURRED TO YOU BUT

02:05:15.942 --> 02:05:18.845 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE MAN OR THE WOMAN IN

02:05:17.377 --> 02:05:20.780 region:rollup2
THE MIRROR AND SAY WHO AM I HAS

02:05:18.845 --> 02:05:23.516 region:rollup2

02:05:31.057 --> 02:05:32.825 region:rollup2
CALLED SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES AND

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:35.228 region:rollup2

02:05:42.368 --> 02:05:45.905 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND AND EMPATHIZE AND AND

02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:47.373 region:rollup2

KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OF

02:06:33.519 --> 02:06:37.723 region:rollup2
DAWN ON THEM IN THE SENATOR HAVE

02:06:34.587 --> 02:06:37.890 region:rollup2
A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION ABOUT IT.

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:38.591 region:rollup2
AND.

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:40.426 region:rollup2
.

02:06:38.591 --> 02:06:42.195 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S

02:06:40.426 --> 02:06:44.597 region:rollup2
IT ALLOWS YOU TO BELIEVE YOU CAN

02:06:42.195 --> 02:06:45.731 region:rollup2
BE ANYTHING. THAT YOU WANT TO BE

02:06:44.597 --> 02:06:47.934 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THEN YOU COME IN

02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:50.102 region:rollup2
THE WORKPLACE AND YOU TRY AND

02:06:47.934 --> 02:06:50.970 region:rollup2
THINGS HAPPEN THAT.

02:06:50.102 --> 02:06:54.106 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT KIND OF HITS YOU

02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:54.974 region:rollup2
LIKE WOW YOU KNOW. IT IS A.

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:56.776 region:rollup2
THAT A NEW AWAKENING.

02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:59.111 region:rollup2
.

02:06:56.776 --> 02:07:00.446 region:rollup2
BUT I ONE I WAS GONNA ASK IF YOU

02:06:59.111 --> 02:07:02.415 region:rollup2
COULD JUST TALK A LITTLE MORE

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:05.118 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE.

02:07:02.415 --> 02:07:05.751 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT WORKS.

02:07:05.118 --> 02:07:07.653 region:rollup2
YES.

02:07:05.751 --> 02:07:08.955 region:rollup2
SO EVERY CAMPUS HAS A

02:07:07.653 --> 02:07:10.790 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE THEIR

02:07:08.955 --> 02:07:12.992 region:rollup2
THEIR LEGALLY PRIVILEGED THEY'RE

02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:14.594 region:rollup2
TRAINED AS SEXUAL ASSAULT OR

02:07:12.992 --> 02:07:15.661 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELORS AND

02:07:14.594 --> 02:07:17.196 region:rollup2
IN FACT SENATOR JACKSON'S

02:07:15.661 --> 02:07:18.764 region:rollup2
SPONSORED A BILL LAST YEAR THAT.

02:07:17.196 --> 02:07:21.100 region:rollup2
INSURE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE.

02:07:18.764 --> 02:07:23.002 region:rollup2
A LEGAL PRIVILEGE WHEN THEY'RE

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:25.238 region:rollup2
COUNTING ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS

02:07:23.002 --> 02:07:27.073 region:rollup2
WELL AND LAW.

02:07:25.238 --> 02:07:28.407 region:rollup2
THANK YOU HUNT BUT I SO SO

02:07:27.073 --> 02:07:30.810 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALSO INDEPENDENT.

02:07:28.407 --> 02:07:33.012 region:rollup2
THEY BASICALLY SERVE AS A

02:07:30.810 --> 02:07:34.347 region:rollup2
RESOURCE SO IF SOMEONE GOES TO

02:07:33.012 --> 02:07:36.482 region:rollup2
THEM THEY CAN COME IN A

02:07:34.347 --> 02:07:37.984 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL SPACE EXPLAINS THEM

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:38.518 region:rollup2
HERE YOUR OPTIONS THIS IS WHAT

02:07:37.984 --> 02:07:40.286 region:rollup2
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF YOU

02:07:38.518 --> 02:07:41.087 region:rollup2
REPORTED. ON THIS IS WHAT IT

02:07:40.286 --> 02:07:42.755 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE IF YOU DON'T WANNA

02:07:41.087 --> 02:07:44.991 region:rollup2
REPORT RIGHT NOW BUT MAYBE WE

02:07:42.755 --> 02:07:45.992 region:rollup2
CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU.

02:07:44.991 --> 02:07:47.393 region:rollup2
I THINK

02:07:45.992 --> 02:07:48.628 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE A FEAR OF COMING

02:07:47.393 --> 02:07:50.196 region:rollup2
FORWARD BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S

02:07:48.628 --> 02:07:52.398 region:rollup2
GONNA START.

02:07:50.196 --> 02:07:53.933 region:rollup2
I TRAIN LEAVING THE STATION THAT

02:07:52.398 --> 02:07:55.868 region:rollup2
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO CONTROL

02:07:53.933 --> 02:07:57.036 region:rollup2
AND SO THE MORE YOU CAN MAKE

02:07:55.868 --> 02:07:59.372 region:rollup2
SOMEONE FEEL THAT THEY'RE IN

02:07:57.036 --> 02:08:00.439 region:rollup2
CONTROL. OF THAT PROCESS THE

02:07:59.372 --> 02:08:01.407 region:rollup2
MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO COME

02:08:00.439 --> 02:08:03.609 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:08:01.407 --> 02:08:05.344 region:rollup2
SO WE FOUND THOSE CONFIDENTIAL

02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:06.812 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES I THINK OUR STUDENTS

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:07.780 region:rollup2

02:08:06.812 --> 02:08:10.716 region:rollup2

ROLE OF THE ON BUT PERSON VERSUS

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:42.582 region:rollup2
THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE.

THANK YOU FOR ASKING SO THE

02:08:42.582 --> 02:08:45.117 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE ADVOCATE AS I

02:08:43.482 --> 02:08:46.919 region:rollup2
MENTIONED IS IS LEGALLY

02:08:45.117 --> 02:08:48.554 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGED AND.

02:08:46.919 --> 02:08:49.488 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY I THINK HAS BEEN

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:51.190 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF MORE IN THE SEXUAL

02:08:49.488 --> 02:08:54.260 region:rollup2
ASSAULT.

02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:55.561 region:rollup2
SPACE ON AND PROBABLY MORE

02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:57.163 region:rollup2
STUDENT FOCUSED ALTHOUGH THEY DO

02:08:55.561 --> 02:08:58.497 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT SERVE OUR ENTIRE

02:08:57.163 --> 02:09:00.800 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THE ARM BUDS.

02:08:58.497 --> 02:09:01.367 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NOT CERTAINLY THEY

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.235 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE ANY KIND OF LEGAL

02:09:01.367 --> 02:09:03.469 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE

02:09:02.235 --> 02:09:04.737 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE CONFIDENTIAL THE

02:09:03.469 --> 02:09:07.173 region:rollup2
SENSE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO

02:09:04.737 --> 02:09:08.474 region:rollup2
REPORT. ON MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES

02:09:07.173 --> 02:09:09.675 region:rollup2
ARE WHAT WE CALL RESPONSIBLE

02:09:08.474 --> 02:09:11.177 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WHICH MEANS THAT IF

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:12.044 region:rollup2
THEY BECOME AWARE OF SEXUAL

02:09:11.177 --> 02:09:14.013 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT THEY NEED TO REPORT

02:09:12.044 --> 02:09:15.081 region:rollup2
IT. TO TITLE NINE

02:09:14.013 --> 02:09:17.283 region:rollup2
I'M ENTITLED LINE DECIDES

ON SO BUT THE ON WHAT'S DO NOT

02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:24.090 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT REPORTING OBLIGATION

02:09:22.555 --> 02:09:26.592 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S STILL A CONFIDENTIAL

02:09:24.090 --> 02:09:27.860 region:rollup2
SPACE THAT CAN TRY TO WORK WITH

02:09:26.592 --> 02:09:30.329 region:rollup2
THE PERSON TO COME UP WITH

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:32.565 region:rollup2

THINGS THAT YOU HAD INSTITUTED.

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:43.509 region:rollup2
HOW LONG AGO DID THAT START ON

02:09:40.806 --> 02:09:44.610 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUSES?

02:09:43.509 --> 02:09:46.012 region:rollup2
I THINK SOME CAMPUSES HAD THESE

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:48.347 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES FOR YEARS BUT IT WAS

02:09:46.012 --> 02:09:49.782 region:rollup2

WITH HOW DO WE MAKE AND CREATE A

02:09:57.590 --> 02:10:03.229 region:rollup2
SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR EMPLOYEES

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:04.897 region:rollup2
TO COME FORWARD. AND REPORT WHAT

HAS HAPPENED TO THEM RIGHT.

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:07.800 region:rollup2

BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT

02:13:47.253 --> 02:13:50.956 region:rollup2
WRITTEN ABOUT THIS I WOULD LOOK

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:52.157 region:rollup2

02:19:20.919 --> 02:19:24.489 region:rollup2
CULTURE BECAUSE THAT'S THE

02:19:22.788 --> 02:19:25.357 region:rollup2
BEGINNING.

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:27.259 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IN

02:19:25.357 --> 02:19:29.361 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

02:19:27.259 --> 02:19:31.830 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS

02:19:29.361 --> 02:19:32.064 region:rollup2
MADE HAD TO DO WITH. YOU WANT TO

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:34.533 region:rollup2
BE SURE.

02:19:32.064 --> 02:19:36.335 region:rollup2
.

02:19:34.533 --> 02:19:38.370 region:rollup2
TO TAILOR THAT YOU HAVE

02:19:36.335 --> 02:19:39.471 region:rollup2
COURAGEOUS HR PEOPLE.

02:19:38.370 --> 02:19:41.473 region:rollup2
AND THE ONE THING THAT CAME TO

02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:44.776 region:rollup2
MIND IS.

02:19:41.473 --> 02:19:46.044 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO EMPOWER OUR AGE ARE

02:19:44.776 --> 02:19:47.546 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL.

02:19:46.044 --> 02:19:49.748 region:rollup2
IF.

02:19:47.546 --> 02:19:51.483 region:rollup2
THEY.

02:19:49.748 --> 02:19:52.985 region:rollup2
THE CULTURE HAS BEEN SUCH THAT

02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:53.552 region:rollup2
THEY ARE TOLD WHAT THEY HAVE TO

02:19:52.985 --> 02:19:55.921 region:rollup2
DO THEN WERE NOT EMPOWERING

02:19:53.552 --> 02:19:57.155 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:19:55.921 --> 02:19:59.258 region:rollup2
IS THAT ANOTHER PART OF THE

02:19:57.155 --> 02:20:01.260 region:rollup2
CULTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED

02:19:59.258 --> 02:20:02.427 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT.

02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:02.995 region:rollup2
WELL THERE'S A QUICK AND IT

02:20:02.427 --> 02:20:04.496 region:rollup2
STARTS FROM THE TOP IN THAT

02:20:02.995 --> 02:20:06.265 region:rollup2
RESPECT.

02:20:04.496 --> 02:20:08.867 region:rollup2
THE HR LEADERS HAVE TO BELIEVE

02:20:06.265 --> 02:20:10.569 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN I GO OUT THERE AND I'M

02:20:08.867 --> 02:20:12.671 region:rollup2
BEING OBJECTIVE AND HONEST AND I

02:20:10.569 --> 02:20:13.605 region:rollup2
KEEP YOU FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT'S

02:20:12.671 --> 02:20:15.574 region:rollup2
GOING ON IN OUR UP AN

02:20:13.605 --> 02:20:17.075 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THAT YOU WILL DO

02:20:15.574 --> 02:20:18.377 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WITH THAT AND IF YOU

02:20:17.075 --> 02:20:20.078 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT.</c></u>

02:20:18.377 --> 02:20:22.748 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WILL AT LEAST NOT HOLD

02:20:20.078 --> 02:20:24.416 region:rollup2
ME ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE I'M

02:20:22.748 --> 02:20:26.285 region:rollup2
JUST THE MESSENGER IF YOU WILL.

02:20:24.416 --> 02:20:27.085 region:rollup2
AND SO ON YOU'RE TO STEP VERSION

02:20:26.285 --> 02:20:28.320 region:rollup2
IN NATURE PERSON WHO'S

02:20:27.085 --> 02:20:29.922 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH AND

02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:31.690 region:rollup2
COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO DO IT BUT

02:20:29.922 --> 02:20:33.692 region:rollup2
THEN THE ORGANIZATION AGAIN

02:20:31.690 --> 02:20:37.896 region:rollup2
CANNOT IMMEDIATELY GIVE NEGATIVE

02:20:33.692 --> 02:20:37.896 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES TO HIM OR HER.

02:20:37.963 --> 02:20:41.366 region:rollup2
GOES BACK TO THE STUDIO ADDRESS

02:20:40.732 --> 02:20:41.967 region:rollup2
OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT THIS

02:20:41.366 --> 02:20:43.435 region:rollup2
THEY TALK ABOUT IT BUT THEY

02:20:41.967 --> 02:20:45.737 region:rollup2
DON'T MEAN IT SO THAT SHORT

02:20:43.435 --> 02:20:46.972 region:rollup2
ANSWER IS IT REQUIRES NOT ONLY

02:20:45.737 --> 02:20:48.607 region:rollup2
FINDING THE RIGHT AGE A PERSON

02:20:46.972 --> 02:20:51.043 region:rollup2
BUT CREATING A CULTURE AND

02:20:48.607 --> 02:20:52.811 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF PEOPLE. BUT ALSO A

02:20:51.043 --> 02:20:54.146 region:rollup2
CULTURE WITH THE HR FOLKS CAN

02:20:52.811 --> 02:20:56.615 region:rollup2
REALLY DO WHAT THEY DO BEST AND

02:20:54.146 --> 02:21:00.252 region:rollup2
THAT IS REALLY SIGNAL TO YOU

02:20:56.615 --> 02:21:01.053 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR.

02:21:00.252 --> 02:21:02.821 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS

02:21:01.053 --> 02:21:04.823 region:rollup2
MADE HAS TO DO WITH HOLDING

02:21:02.821 --> 02:21:05.891 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.

02:21:04.823 --> 02:21:06.725 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THERE'S A COMMENT

02:21:05.891 --> 02:21:07.626 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TENURE PROFESSOR

02:21:06.725 --> 02:21:09.428 region:rollup2
VERSUS SOMEONE.

02:21:07.626 --> 02:21:10.462 region:rollup2
TENURED.

02:21:09.428 --> 02:21:13.231 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK ALONG THE SAME

02:21:10.462 --> 02:21:16.501 region:rollup2
LINES WE HAVE LEGISLATORS WHO

02:21:13.231 --> 02:21:18.670 region:rollup2
ARE. ELECTED VERSES IT COULD BE

02:21:16.501 --> 02:21:20.872 region:rollup2
A SUPERVISOR EMPLOYEES.

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:22.908 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.

02:21:20.872 --> 02:21:24.776 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU HAVE LEGISLATORS

02:21:22.908 --> 02:21:27.512 region:rollup2
JUST AS OUR CHAIRWOMAN HAS OFTEN

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:28.780 region:rollup2
SAID. THEY ARE NOT EMPLOYEES IN

02:21:27.512 --> 02:21:30.782 region:rollup2
THE THE SAME SENSE OF THAT.

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:32.384 region:rollup2
.

02:21:30.782 --> 02:21:34.052 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER EMPLOYEE WOULD BE

02:21:32.384 --> 02:21:34.619 region:rollup2
CLASSIFIED.

02:21:34.052 --> 02:21:37.556 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT HOW

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:39.458 region:rollup2
YOU.

02:21:37.556 --> 02:21:40.892 region:rollup2
HOLD SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE.

02:21:39.458 --> 02:21:43.028 region:rollup2
WHO WAS A LEGISLATOR VERSUS HOW

02:21:40.892 --> 02:21:45.797 region:rollup2
YOU HOLD SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE

02:21:43.028 --> 02:21:48.867 region:rollup2
WHO IS A? YET EITHER SUPERVISOR

02:21:45.797 --> 02:21:50.402 region:rollup2
OR AN EMPLOYEE.

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:52.637 region:rollup2
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I AND

02:21:50.402 --> 02:21:54.673 region:rollup2
I. WANT TO REMEMBER THAT IN BOTH

02:21:52.637 --> 02:21:55.807 region:rollup2
INSTANCES THERE ARE GOOD REASONS

02:21:54.673 --> 02:21:57.809 region:rollup2
WHY HEY.

02:21:55.807 --> 02:22:00.112 region:rollup2
A LEGISLATOR OR A TENURED

02:21:57.809 --> 02:22:01.680 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR CAN'T BE TERMINATED

02:22:00.112 --> 02:22:03.081 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT UP FOR TIP FOR

02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:04.850 region:rollup2
POLITICAL PROTECTION RIGHT IN

02:22:03.081 --> 02:22:06.451 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC FREEDOM SO IT SO THERE

02:22:04.850 --> 02:22:08.887 region:rollup2
ARE GOOD REASONS FOR IT.

02:22:06.451 --> 02:22:10.722 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY

02:22:08.887 --> 02:22:15.227 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:22:10.722 --> 02:22:17.162 region:rollup2
AGAIN TO START TO TIE.

02:22:15.227 --> 02:22:18.964 region:rollup2
TIED TO THE MISSION.

02:22:17.162 --> 02:22:20.465 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO TO ENSURE THAT WE THAT

02:22:18.964 --> 02:22:23.435 region:rollup2
WOULD TO START TALKING TO OUR

02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:25.404 region:rollup2
FACULTY ABOUT WHY WERE HERE WHY

02:22:23.435 --> 02:22:27.305 region:rollup2
THEY'RE WHAT THEIR PURPOSE AT

02:22:25.404 --> 02:22:29.841 region:rollup2
BEING YOU THAT YOU SEE IS. AND

02:22:27.305 --> 02:22:30.909 region:rollup2
IT'S TO EDUCATE AND WHEN.

02:22:29.841 --> 02:22:32.411 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'VE SEEN THESE

02:22:30.909 --> 02:22:34.146 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR THESE HIGHER PROFILE

02:22:32.411 --> 02:22:35.313 region:rollup2
MATTERS REALLY DESTROYED

02:22:34.146 --> 02:22:37.282 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS.

02:22:35.313 --> 02:22:37.783 region:rollup2
DISTRACT THEM FROM THEIR

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:39.050 region:rollup2
SMALLER SHIP WOULD BE AN

02:22:37.783 --> 02:22:41.420 region:rollup2
UNDERSTATEMENT.

02:22:39.050 --> 02:22:42.487 region:rollup2
REALLY DAMAGE THE INSTITUTION

02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:43.822 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'VE LOVED AND THE

02:22:42.487 --> 02:22:45.323 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY'VE LOVED.

02:22:43.822 --> 02:22:45.957 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'VE BEEN MUCH MORE

02:22:45.323 --> 02:22:48.260 region:rollup2
WILLING

02:22:45.957 --> 02:22:50.228 region:rollup2
TO.

02:22:48.260 --> 02:22:51.496 region:rollup2
HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE AND

02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:52.831 region:rollup2
THAT REPUTATION THAT

02:22:51.496 --> 02:22:53.765 region:rollup2
REPUTATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY IS

02:22:52.831 --> 02:22:56.601 region:rollup2
QUITE.

02:22:53.765 --> 02:22:57.502 region:rollup2
QUITE POWERFUL IN IN CERTAINLY

02:22:56.601 --> 02:22:59.004 region:rollup2
IN IN YOUR HER.

02:22:57.502 --> 02:23:00.739 region:rollup2
PROFESSION BUT ALSO IN THE IN

02:22:59.004 --> 02:23:02.507 region:rollup2
THE ACADEMIC PROFESSION

02:23:00.739 --> 02:23:04.109 region:rollup2
ON AND ON SOME LEVEL.

02:23:02.507 --> 02:23:04.576 region:rollup2
FACULTY MEMBERS FOUND

02:23:04.109 --> 02:23:05.544 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL

02:23:04.576 --> 02:23:06.678 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

02:23:05.544 --> 02:23:08.914 region:rollup2
.

02:23:06.678 --> 02:23:10.282 region:rollup2
PAYS A PRICE.

02:23:08.914 --> 02:23:11.483 region:rollup2
PROBABLY MUCH GREATER THAN A

02:23:10.282 --> 02:23:13.952 region:rollup2
CORPORATE EMPLOYEE BECAUSE IT'S

02:23:11.483 --> 02:23:14.119 region:rollup2
IT'S OUT THERE.

02:23:13.952 --> 02:23:15.954 region:rollup2
AND.

02:23:14.119 --> 02:23:17.689 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:19.257 region:rollup2
IT'S PUBLIC INFORMATION AND AND

02:23:17.689 --> 02:23:21.226 region:rollup2
NO YOU KNOW A UNIVERSITY CAN BE

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:22.761 region:rollup2
VERY HESITANT TO TAKE ON THAT

02:23:21.226 --> 02:23:23.962 region:rollup2
FACULTY MEMBER OR EVEN PUBLISH

02:23:22.761 --> 02:23:25.530 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK.

02:23:23.962 --> 02:23:29.501 region:rollup2
IF THEIR REPUTATIONS BEEN

02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:30.902 region:rollup2
DAMAGED IN THAT WAY.

02:23:29.501 --> 02:23:35.173 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COMMENT THAT WAS MADE

02:23:30.902 --> 02:23:38.643 region:rollup2
HOW TO DO WITH SWIFT ACTION.

02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:41.847 region:rollup2
WHEN A REPORT IS RECEIVED.

02:23:38.643 --> 02:23:43.281 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR

02:23:41.847 --> 02:23:46.118 region:rollup2
THEIR HOUSE TO BE SWIFT ACTION

02:23:43.281 --> 02:23:47.819 region:rollup2
SALUTE YOU KNOW THAT. THE THE.

02:23:46.118 --> 02:23:49.554 region:rollup2
THE DISCIPLINE OR THE REACTION

02:23:47.819 --> 02:23:51.990 region:rollup2
ISN'T HE IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WAS

02:23:49.554 --> 02:23:52.858 region:rollup2
REPORTED.

02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:59.764 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE BALANCE THAT WITH DUE

02:23:52.858 --> 02:24:00.899 region:rollup2
PROCESS?

02:23:59.764 --> 02:24:02.334 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A PAUSE HOME. THAT'S

02:24:00.899 --> 02:24:04.503 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE

02:24:02.334 --> 02:24:06.505 region:rollup2
A.

02:24:04.503 --> 02:24:07.572 region:rollup2
SWIFT BUT DELIBERATE. IS PERHAPS

02:24:06.505 --> 02:24:08.940 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT WE TRY TO USE THOSE

02:24:07.572 --> 02:24:11.142 region:rollup2
TERMS

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:12.144 region:rollup2
IN HASTE WILL MAKE WASTE AND OWN

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:14.079 region:rollup2
WE ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE'S

02:24:12.144 --> 02:24:16.615 region:rollup2
LIVES ON BOTH SIDES.

02:24:14.079 --> 02:24:18.216 region:rollup2
BUT THIS THE SITUATION AND SO

02:24:16.615 --> 02:24:19.985 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PROCESS THAT SAYS WE

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:21.386 region:rollup2
WANT TO MOVE ACROSS BUT I GIVE

02:24:19.985 --> 02:24:22.821 region:rollup2
YOU A CLASSIC EXAMPLE ALL OF US

02:24:21.386 --> 02:24:24.656 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE WORLD.

02:24:22.821 --> 02:24:26.258 region:rollup2
FRANKLY AND I THINK A LOT OF

02:24:24.656 --> 02:24:28.093 region:rollup2
PEOPLE A NON A CHAU WORLD THAT

02:24:26.258 --> 02:24:29.027 region:rollup2
WITH THE MATT LAUER SITUATION.

02:24:28.093 --> 02:24:30.729 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY IF YOU BELIEVE WHAT

02:24:29.027 --> 02:24:32.497 region:rollup2
WAS SAID.

02:24:30.729 --> 02:24:33.532 region:rollup2
THE THE REPORT CAME TO THEM FOR

02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:34.699 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY YEARS

02:24:33.532 --> 02:24:36.668 region:rollup2
ON A MONDAY AND THEN.

02:24:34.699 --> 02:24:40.038 region:rollup2
S. FIRED ON TUESDAY.

02:24:36.668 --> 02:24:41.706 region:rollup2
NO ONE THOUGHT THAT A THAT WAS

02:24:40.038 --> 02:24:43.642 region:rollup2
OVERLY SWIFT THAT'S THE POINT

02:24:41.706 --> 02:24:45.277 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THE END RESULT WAS WHAT

02:24:43.642 --> 02:24:47.779 region:rollup2
IT WAS AND WE BELIEVE THAT WAS

02:24:45.277 --> 02:24:49.848 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT RESULT. THE IDEA THAT

02:24:47.779 --> 02:24:51.349 region:rollup2
YOU COULD CONDUCT IN THE

02:24:49.848 --> 02:24:52.417 region:rollup2
SEMBLANCE OF A REAL

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:54.286 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AS AN HR

02:24:52.417 --> 02:24:56.021 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL IN LESS INTO

02:24:54.286 --> 02:24:57.255 region:rollup2
A POOR OURS AND MAKE A DECISION.

02:24:56.021 --> 02:24:59.591 region:rollup2
YOU CAN MAKE A DECISION TO

02:24:57.255 --> 02:25:01.059 region:rollup2
SUSPEND WHICH IS A DIFFERENT

02:24:59.591 --> 02:25:02.627 region:rollup2
DECISION THAN A FULL OUT

02:25:01.059 --> 02:25:03.662 region:rollup2
TERMINATION DECISION BECAUSE

02:25:02.627 --> 02:25:06.264 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S LOOKING THEY'RE

02:25:03.662 --> 02:25:08.400 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT MY GOSH. AND I'M

02:25:06.264 --> 02:25:09.034 region:rollup2
GONNA GO SO FAR AS YOU YOU LIKE

02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:10.202 region:rollup2
IN A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT YOU SEE

02:25:09.034 --> 02:25:12.370 region:rollup2
IN THE.

02:25:10.202 --> 02:25:14.272 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORLD EVEN WHEN

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:15.874 region:rollup2
WE SEE SOMEONE COMMIT A CRIME

02:25:14.272 --> 02:25:18.043 region:rollup2
IT'S ON VIDEO BUBBA BLAH WE

02:25:15.874 --> 02:25:19.911 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH WE

02:25:18.043 --> 02:25:21.346 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHETHER WHAT IF THAT

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:22.914 region:rollup2
PERSON WAS WHAT WE REALLY SAW

02:25:21.346 --> 02:25:23.782 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SAW. AND WHAT ARE THE

02:25:22.914 --> 02:25:25.917 region:rollup2
MITIGATING FOR.

02:25:23.782 --> 02:25:27.552 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES IMPACTORS AND

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:28.553 region:rollup2
THEN WE MAKE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF

02:25:27.552 --> 02:25:31.222 region:rollup2
OF OF BOB.

02:25:28.553 --> 02:25:32.390 region:rollup2
PUNISHMENT OR DISCIPLINE.

02:25:31.222 --> 02:25:34.593 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE I THINK THAT IS A

02:25:32.390 --> 02:25:35.894 region:rollup2
PERFECT WAY FOR SAID THINK ABOUT

02:25:34.593 --> 02:25:37.329 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER

02:25:35.894 --> 02:25:38.897 region:rollup2
FORMS WORKPLACE HARASSMENT BUT

02:25:37.329 --> 02:25:41.366 region:rollup2
THIS NOTION THAT WE NEED TO

02:25:38.897 --> 02:25:44.202 region:rollup2
LEARN ONE DAY AND WITHIN A DATA

02:25:41.366 --> 02:25:45.570 region:rollup2
TO OUR WEEK. SORT IT AND MAKE A

02:25:44.202 --> 02:25:47.272 region:rollup2
DECISION ABOUT SOMEONE'S LIFE TO

02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:49.708 region:rollup2
PUT IT TAKES TIME TO PROPERLY

02:25:47.272 --> 02:25:51.676 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE INTERVIEW WITNESSES.

02:25:49.708 --> 02:25:53.111 region:rollup2
IT TAKES TIME TO PROPERLY VET

02:25:51.676 --> 02:25:54.980 region:rollup2
THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER SEPARATE

02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:56.581 region:rollup2
FACT FROM FICTION.

02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:57.983 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW AS A PRACTICING

02:25:56.581 --> 02:25:59.584 region:rollup2
LAWYER WHO DID SEXUAL HARASSMENT

02:25:57.983 --> 02:26:01.620 region:rollup2
AND OTHER FORMS OF HARASSMENT

02:25:59.584 --> 02:26:03.088 region:rollup2
THOSE INVESTIGATIONS FOR YEARS.

02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:04.756 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MAGIC

02:26:03.088 --> 02:26:06.024 region:rollup2
PERIOD AS ITS SHOULDN'T TAKE TWO

02:26:04.756 --> 02:26:07.058 region:rollup2
YEARS TO DO IT BUT I AM

02:26:06.024 --> 02:26:09.928 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT IS NOT

02:26:07.058 --> 02:26:11.162 region:rollup2
A WEEK EITHER.

02:26:09.928 --> 02:26:13.698 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU SAY THAT PART OF THAT

02:26:11.162 --> 02:26:17.002 region:rollup2
HAS TO DO WITH THE RELATIONSHIP.

02:26:13.698 --> 02:26:18.536 region:rollup2
TWEEN A SUPERVISOR. ASSUMING

02:26:17.002 --> 02:26:19.137 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S AN EMPLOYEE.

02:26:18.536 --> 02:26:20.905 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A

02:26:19.137 --> 02:26:22.841 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR IN THE EMPLOYEE THE

02:26:20.905 --> 02:26:25.477 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE HAS NOW WHEN THAT'S NOT

02:26:22.841 --> 02:26:26.878 region:rollup2
A GOOD EXAMPLE. LET'S GO TO

02:26:25.477 --> 02:26:28.213 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS.

02:26:26.878 --> 02:26:30.515 region:rollup2
LET'S GO TO SECTOR WHAT WE'RE

02:26:28.213 --> 02:26:31.916 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT YES IF IF YOU HAVE

02:26:30.515 --> 02:26:34.819 region:rollup2
A LEGISLATOR WHO HAS.

02:26:31.916 --> 02:26:36.454 region:rollup2
BEEN ACCUSED.

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:38.356 region:rollup2
IF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

02:26:36.454 --> 02:26:39.891 region:rollup2
LEGISLATOR AND THAT LEGISLATORS

02:26:38.356 --> 02:26:41.893 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR.

02:26:39.891 --> 02:26:42.827 region:rollup2
IS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH A

02:26:41.893 --> 02:26:45.130 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR SAYS WE HEAR THE

02:26:42.827 --> 02:26:46.665 region:rollup2
SPEAKER.

02:26:45.130 --> 02:26:48.767 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SITUATION

02:26:46.665 --> 02:26:50.969 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD

02:26:48.767 --> 02:26:53.204 region:rollup2
GO WHETHER IT'S TOO TO RESIGN OR

02:26:50.969 --> 02:26:57.175 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IS THAT RELATIONSHIP.

02:26:53.204 --> 02:26:58.276 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN THIS SORT OF A.

02:26:57.175 --> 02:27:00.011 region:rollup2
YEAH SHE WAS SO IT'S

02:26:58.276 --> 02:27:02.314 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY FOUNDED IN TRUST.

02:27:00.011 --> 02:27:03.648 region:rollup2
AND AND THE ORG AND WE TALKED

02:27:02.314 --> 02:27:04.749 region:rollup2
EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF THE

02:27:03.648 --> 02:27:06.318 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION I THINK YOU HAVE TWO

02:27:04.749 --> 02:27:07.719 region:rollup2
OPTIONS HERE ONE OF WHICH IS NOT

02:27:06.318 --> 02:27:09.120 region:rollup2
RELAPSE AND ONE IS EXPULSION AND

02:27:07.719 --> 02:27:10.522 region:rollup2
ONE A SUSPENSION.

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:12.190 region:rollup2
I THINK AS A PRACTICAL MATTER

02:27:10.522 --> 02:27:13.124 region:rollup2
YOU ALL CAN BOAT TO SEE

02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:15.126 region:rollup2
SPEND DON'T ONE OF YOUR

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:17.162 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES WHO YOU COLLECTIVELY

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:18.563 region:rollup2
DETERMINE. HAS ENGAGED IN THE

02:27:17.162 --> 02:27:20.165 region:rollup2
QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR AND

02:27:18.563 --> 02:27:22.267 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR UP

02:27:20.165 --> 02:27:24.402 region:rollup2
TO AND INCLUDING SEXUAL ASSAULT.

02:27:22.267 --> 02:27:26.404 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SUSPEND THEM I DON'T

02:27:24.402 --> 02:27:27.639 region:rollup2
KNOW OVER TIME I DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:29.140 region:rollup2
THE HISTORY IS IN CALIFORNIA BUT

02:27:27.639 --> 02:27:30.275 region:rollup2
IF YOU'VE EVER USED THE

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:32.043 region:rollup2
EXPULSION.

02:27:30.275 --> 02:27:33.845 region:rollup2
OPTION

02:27:32.043 --> 02:27:35.346 region:rollup2
AND THAT AGAIN IS WHEN YOU GO

02:27:33.845 --> 02:27:35.914 region:rollup2
BACK TWO PEOPLE JUDGING YOU BY

02:27:35.346 --> 02:27:37.749 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU DO AND NOT WHAT YOU

02:27:35.914 --> 02:27:38.450 region:rollup2
SAY.

02:27:37.749 --> 02:27:40.485 region:rollup2
I THINK SUSPENSION IS

02:27:38.450 --> 02:27:42.187 region:rollup2
INTERESTING TEMPORARILY AND I

02:27:40.485 --> 02:27:43.154 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE ARE TONS OF HURDLES

02:27:42.187 --> 02:27:43.688 region:rollup2
AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO MISS

02:27:43.154 --> 02:27:44.589 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZE YOUR COMMENTS

02:27:43.688 --> 02:27:46.658 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:27:44.589 --> 02:27:48.059 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST THAT. IF YOU HAVE

02:27:46.658 --> 02:27:49.828 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE AS AN OPTION.

02:27:48.059 --> 02:27:51.763 region:rollup2
AND YOU'VE NEVER USED IT.

02:27:49.828 --> 02:27:53.698 region:rollup2
THEN IS IT REALLY AN OPTION

02:27:51.763 --> 02:27:55.100 region:rollup2
AND OUR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT

02:27:53.698 --> 02:27:57.001 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT IT IF

02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:59.070 region:rollup2
YOU'VE NEVER USED IT. IT'S THE

02:27:57.001 --> 02:28:01.106 region:rollup2
SAME IT'S A THAT'S THE POINT I'M

02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:02.407 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT YES

02:28:01.106 --> 02:28:03.842 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DIFFERENT THAN IF I WERE

02:28:02.407 --> 02:28:05.210 region:rollup2
EVERY COMPANY HAVE GONE TO WORK

02:28:03.842 --> 02:28:07.645 region:rollup2
WITH THE MY LIFE IS SAYS WE'RE

02:28:05.210 --> 02:28:08.713 region:rollup2
UNIQUE.

02:28:07.645 --> 02:28:10.115 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING SHOOTING. YOU KNOW

02:28:08.713 --> 02:28:11.816 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO TWO ORGANIZATIONS

02:28:10.115 --> 02:28:14.285 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THE SAME

02:28:11.816 --> 02:28:16.888 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE SAY ZERO TOLERANCE.

02:28:14.285 --> 02:28:19.524 region:rollup2
THEN WE CAN START PUTTING AND

02:28:16.888 --> 02:28:21.760 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATED SORT OF STANDARDS

02:28:19.524 --> 02:28:23.661 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE ENGAGES IN BEHAVIOR

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:25.530 region:rollup2
THAT BRINGS HARM TO PEOPLE THEN

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:28.099 region:rollup2
YOUR HR FUNCTION U. S. LEADERS

02:28:25.530 --> 02:28:31.269 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TAKE ACTION.

02:28:28.099 --> 02:28:33.605 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY SWIFT.

02:28:31.269 --> 02:28:34.272 region:rollup2
MY LOOK COULD I JUST ADD TO THEM

02:28:33.605 --> 02:28:36.040 region:rollup2
IN IN TALKING ABOUT

02:28:34.272 --> 02:28:38.409 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.711 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

02:28:38.409 --> 02:28:41.312 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T WANNA JUST SHINE THE

02:28:39.711 --> 02:28:43.948 region:rollup2
LIGHT. ON.

02:28:41.312 --> 02:28:45.650 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATIONS

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:46.284 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO WANT TO HOLD PEOPLE

02:28:45.650 --> 02:28:47.452 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING THE RIGHT

02:28:46.284 --> 02:28:50.789 region:rollup2
THING.

02:28:47.452 --> 02:28:52.724 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU WANT THE CONVERSATION

02:28:50.789 --> 02:28:54.893 region:rollup2
NOT JUST TO BE ABOUT. WHAT HAS

02:28:52.724 --> 02:28:56.561 region:rollup2
GONE WRONG BUT HIGHLIGHTING

02:28:54.893 --> 02:28:57.162 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE

02:28:56.561 --> 02:28:58.029 region:rollup2
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING THE

02:28:57.162 --> 02:28:59.864 region:rollup2
RIGHT THING?

02:28:58.029 --> 02:29:02.867 region:rollup2
AND.

02:28:59.864 --> 02:29:04.469 region:rollup2
THAT WAY IT ITS ITS THAT'S MUCH

02:29:02.867 --> 02:29:06.538 region:rollup2
MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF

02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:07.939 region:rollup2
CHANGING PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR. THAN

02:29:06.538 --> 02:29:09.441 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT WELL THERE WAS

02:29:07.939 --> 02:29:11.543 region:rollup2
THIS INVESTIGATION THAT THE

02:29:09.441 --> 02:29:13.611 region:rollup2
RUMOR MILL STARTS YOU KNOW WHAT

02:29:11.543 --> 02:29:17.982 region:rollup2
HAPPENED WAS ENOUGH DONE. I'M TO

02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:20.351 region:rollup2
ALSO TALK ABOUT WHAT WENT RIGHT.

02:29:17.982 --> 02:29:21.786 region:rollup2
IN MY LAST QUESTION MADAM CHAIR.

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:25.089 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

02:29:21.786 --> 02:29:25.657 region:rollup2
REPORTING.

02:29:25.089 --> 02:29:27.525 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE LIFE OF A

02:29:25.657 --> 02:29:28.660 region:rollup2
VICTIM.

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:30.161 region:rollup2
AT WHAT POINT DO WE ALLOW THE

02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:32.197 region:rollup2
VICTIM.

02:29:30.161 --> 02:29:33.932 region:rollup2
TO DIRECT REPORTING.

02:29:32.197 --> 02:29:35.366 region:rollup2
FOR THAT VICTIM TO BE THE ONE

02:29:33.932 --> 02:29:37.602 region:rollup2
WHO DECIDES WHAT IS REPORTED

02:29:35.366 --> 02:29:38.470 region:rollup2
WHEN IT IS REPORTED AND THE

02:29:37.602 --> 02:29:40.138 region:rollup2
DETAILS OF THAT REPORT TO

02:29:38.470 --> 02:29:41.906 region:rollup2
PROTECT.

02:29:40.138 --> 02:29:43.875 region:rollup2
HER AND I RECOGNIZE THAT MEN

02:29:41.906 --> 02:29:45.643 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES OF THE VICTIMS BUT I

02:29:43.875 --> 02:29:48.046 region:rollup2
THINK STATISTICS ARE CLEAR THAT

02:29:45.643 --> 02:29:49.981 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OVER EIGHTY PERCENT.

02:29:48.046 --> 02:29:51.282 region:rollup2
SOME STATISTICS STATISTICS TAKE

02:29:49.981 --> 02:29:52.784 region:rollup2
US UP TO NINETY PERCENT.

02:29:51.282 --> 02:29:53.918 region:rollup2
OF THE VICTIMS ARE WOMEN AND

02:29:52.784 --> 02:29:55.520 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE

02:29:53.918 --> 02:29:57.922 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE WOMEN

02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:59.591 region:rollup2
VICTIMS SO HOW IS IT THAT WE

02:29:57.922 --> 02:30:01.659 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE VICTIMS AND ALLOW

02:29:59.591 --> 02:30:05.263 region:rollup2
THAT VICTIM. TO BE THE ONE TO

02:30:01.659 --> 02:30:06.631 region:rollup2
DIRECT REPORTING OF THE CRIME OR

02:30:05.263 --> 02:30:09.601 region:rollup2
THE HARASSMENT AGAINST.

02:30:06.631 --> 02:30:10.835 region:rollup2
HER OR HIM.

02:30:09.601 --> 02:30:11.803 region:rollup2
WIPING THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY

02:30:10.835 --> 02:30:13.771 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT HAVE SORT OF A

02:30:11.803 --> 02:30:16.307 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL SPACE WHERE THEY

02:30:13.771 --> 02:30:18.343 region:rollup2
CAN GO TO GET INFORMATION AND

02:30:16.307 --> 02:30:19.244 region:rollup2
MAKE CHOICES ON AT A CERTAIN

02:30:18.343 --> 02:30:21.646 region:rollup2
POINT. YOU KNOW.

02:30:19.244 --> 02:30:23.615 region:rollup2
.

02:30:21.646 --> 02:30:25.550 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD BECAUSE THEY.

02:30:23.615 --> 02:30:27.352 region:rollup2
IF THE INSTITUTION KNOWS.

02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:29.087 region:rollup2
WE COULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

02:30:27.352 --> 02:30:30.822 region:rollup2
FOR NOT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT

02:30:29.087 --> 02:30:32.690 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE A

02:30:30.822 --> 02:30:33.725 region:rollup2
VICTIM COME IN. YOU YOU YOU

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:35.960 region:rollup2
CAN'T GATHER.

02:30:33.725 --> 02:30:38.162 region:rollup2
IN OVER TEN REPORTS AGAINST A

02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:39.364 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PERSON AND THEN SAY WELL

02:30:38.162 --> 02:30:40.798 region:rollup2
I'M STILL JUST GONNA LET EACH

02:30:39.364 --> 02:30:42.133 region:rollup2
VICTIM DECIDE.

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:43.501 region:rollup2
HOW THIS GOES BECAUSE AT A

02:30:42.133 --> 02:30:45.703 region:rollup2
CERTAIN POINT THE INSTITUTION

02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:47.272 region:rollup2
HAS TO SAY NO? WE NEED TO DO

02:30:45.703 --> 02:30:50.308 region:rollup2
SOMETHING BUT FOR THE MOST PART

02:30:47.272 --> 02:30:54.579 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU DO WANT TO TRY AND.

02:30:50.308 --> 02:30:56.614 region:rollup2
RESPECT THAT VICTIMS ON WISHES.

02:30:54.579 --> 02:30:57.515 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WHILE BALANCING SAFETY

02:30:56.614 --> 02:30:59.517 region:rollup2
SO I THINK.

02:30:57.515 --> 02:31:01.452 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE KNOWS THAT IF THEY

02:30:59.517 --> 02:31:02.620 region:rollup2
DID COME FORWARD IT'S NOT IT'S

02:31:01.452 --> 02:31:04.122 region:rollup2
NOT AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO THE

02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:05.757 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR REACTION.

02:31:04.122 --> 02:31:06.891 region:rollup2
THAT THERE COULD BE SMALLER

02:31:05.757 --> 02:31:08.726 region:rollup2
THINGS IF IT'S IF VOTE IF

02:31:06.891 --> 02:31:10.762 region:rollup2
SOMEONE COME FORUMS LIKE THIS IS

WE TRY TO DO THAT.

02:31:17.969 --> 02:31:21.306 region:rollup2
AND THEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IF

02:31:19.504 --> 02:31:22.307 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN AND SHOULD

02:31:21.306 --> 02:31:24.208 region:rollup2

SERIOUS IT'S ALSO MAYBE IT'S

02:31:35.687 --> 02:31:39.190 region:rollup2

IT MAY BE THAT IT MAY NEVER BE

02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:46.798 region:rollup2
USED BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT THE

02:31:44.228 --> 02:31:48.333 region:rollup2
RIGHT INSTRUMENT. A MISTER DALI.

AND AT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

02:31:58.009 --> 02:32:01.279 region:rollup2
FIND.

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:02.580 region:rollup2
INTERESTING ABOUT NOT COMING TO

02:32:01.279 --> 02:32:04.015 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:06.250 region:rollup2
AFTER SERVING IN LOCAL

02:32:06.250 --> 02:32:07.051 region:rollup2

THAT.

02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:09.821 region:rollup2
THAT THIS.

02:32:08.519 --> 02:32:12.290 region:rollup2
THESE BODIES PASS.

02:32:09.821 --> 02:32:13.558 region:rollup2
.

02:32:12.290 --> 02:32:16.060 region:rollup2
I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:32:13.558 --> 02:32:19.364 region:rollup2
WHEN I CAME AS AS A LEGISLATOR.

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:21.366 region:rollup2

ARE THE LAWS OF CALIFORNIA. AND

02:32:42.954 --> 02:32:45.857 region:rollup2
THERE ARE YOUKNOW WORKERS HAVE

02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:47.358 region:rollup2
TONS OF RIGHTS AND THERE'S LOTS

02:32:45.857 --> 02:32:49.127 region:rollup2
OF REASONS FOR ALL THESE LAWS

02:32:47.358 --> 02:32:50.328 region:rollup2
AND AND I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT.

02:32:49.127 --> 02:32:51.129 region:rollup2
A BUT WHEN I CAME THE

02:32:50.328 --> 02:32:52.296 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

02:32:51.129 --> 02:32:54.032 region:rollup2
AFTER COME A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

AYE AYE AYE. DID ALL THE SAME

02:32:54.032 --> 02:32:56.634 region:rollup2
THINGS I DID AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:58.936 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS.

02:32:56.634 --> 02:33:00.705 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW. ENCOURAGE THE PERSON

02:32:58.936 --> 02:33:02.073 region:rollup2
GAVE HIM IN WRITING ALL THESE

02:33:00.705 --> 02:33:04.642 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I NEEDED TO DO TO.

02:33:02.073 --> 02:33:07.011 region:rollup2
TRY TO IMPROVE THE THE ABILITY

02:33:04.642 --> 02:33:08.613 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO WORK AND IT DIDN'T

02:33:07.011 --> 02:33:10.715 region:rollup2
WORK OUT SO LET HAD LET THAT

02:33:08.613 --> 02:33:11.182 region:rollup2
PERSON GO SIGHT I TURNED INTO.

02:33:10.715 --> 02:33:12.717 region:rollup2
THE PAPERWORK TO OUR.

02:33:11.182 --> 02:33:13.985 region:rollup2
.

02:33:12.717 --> 02:33:14.852 region:rollup2
THE RULES COMMITTEE AND SAID I'M

02:33:13.985 --> 02:33:15.453 region:rollup2
NOT LET THIS PERSON'S GOING TO

02:33:14.852 --> 02:33:15.920 region:rollup2
SETTLE MISTER AL YOU KNOW YOU

02:33:15.453 --> 02:33:16.921 region:rollup2
DON'T.

02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:18.589 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFERENT HERE AT THE STATE

02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:19.891 region:rollup2
LEVEL YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE.

02:33:18.589 --> 02:33:21.893 region:rollup2
TO BUILD A CASE YOU THEIR OUT

02:33:19.891 --> 02:33:23.327 region:rollup2
WILL EMPLOYEES.

02:33:21.893 --> 02:33:25.630 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING I FOUND VERY

02:33:23.327 --> 02:33:27.298 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING AS A. PERSON HAS TO

02:33:25.630 --> 02:33:28.399 region:rollup2
ABIDE BY THE LAWS LAS IN

02:33:27.298 --> 02:33:29.734 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT AND MY HOME BUSINESS

02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:31.536 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW THAT LEGISLATURE

02:33:29.734 --> 02:33:33.237 region:rollup2
HAS EXEMPTED THEMSELVES FROM THE

02:33:31.536 --> 02:33:35.306 region:rollup2
LAWS THEY PASS.

02:33:33.237 --> 02:33:37.875 region:rollup2
SO LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE WE ARE

02:33:35.306 --> 02:33:38.476 region:rollup2
ABLE TO WORK. A TWENTY HOUR DAY

02:33:37.875 --> 02:33:39.610 region:rollup2
HERE WITHOUT GIVING R. PLAYS A

02:33:38.476 --> 02:33:40.878 region:rollup2
BREAK.

02:33:39.610 --> 02:33:42.313 region:rollup2
NOW I'M NOT ABLE TO DO THAT AT

02:33:40.878 --> 02:33:44.048 region:rollup2
HOME BECAUSE I'M IN VIOLATION OF

02:33:42.313 --> 02:33:46.918 region:rollup2
LABOR LAWS.

02:33:44.048 --> 02:33:48.653 region:rollup2
THAT WE PASS AND SO.

02:33:46.918 --> 02:33:50.054 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I OFTEN SAY TO MY

02:33:48.653 --> 02:33:51.355 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES THAT IF YOU HAD TO

02:33:50.054 --> 02:33:52.790 region:rollup2
LIVE BY THE LAWS YOU PASS YOU

02:33:51.355 --> 02:33:53.391 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T PASS SOME OF THOSE LAWS

02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:54.892 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT

02:33:53.391 --> 02:33:56.294 region:rollup2
TO LIVE BY.

02:33:54.892 --> 02:33:58.129 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE EXEMPTED OURSELVES

02:33:56.294 --> 02:33:59.697 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE WE HAVE A CULTURE

02:33:58.129 --> 02:34:01.032 region:rollup2
HERE THAT SAYS WE ARE ABOVE THE

02:33:59.697 --> 02:34:03.301 region:rollup2
LAW BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN ABIDE

02:34:01.032 --> 02:34:04.402 region:rollup2
BY THE OWN LAWS THAT WE PASS.

02:34:03.301 --> 02:34:05.603 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T CHEAT OUR EMPLOYEES

02:34:04.402 --> 02:34:06.037 region:rollup2
THE SAME AS I HAVE TO TREAT MY

02:34:05.603 --> 02:34:08.539 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AT HOME.

02:34:06.037 --> 02:34:09.740 region:rollup2
.

02:34:08.539 --> 02:34:11.008 region:rollup2
AND I THINK GOT CULTURE AS WE

02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:12.510 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THIS CULTURE THERE'S

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:13.611 region:rollup2
A CULTURE THAT WERE BETTER THAN

02:34:12.510 --> 02:34:15.346 region:rollup2
EVEN OUR OWN LAWS THAT WE HAVE

02:34:13.611 --> 02:34:16.481 region:rollup2
TO ABIDE BY OUR LAWS AND IN THAT

02:34:15.346 --> 02:34:19.951 region:rollup2
SETS IT.

02:34:16.481 --> 02:34:20.918 region:rollup2
THE PARADIGM AND IN PLACE SO YOU

02:34:19.951 --> 02:34:21.552 region:rollup2
KNOW FOR GOING FORWARD.

02:34:20.918 --> 02:34:29.694 region:rollup2
WE ARE EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN HER

02:34:21.552 --> 02:34:31.429 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:34:29.694 --> 02:34:32.764 region:rollup2
THE BODY IS GRAPPLING WITH WHAT

02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:34.565 region:rollup2
IS THE CULTURE OF THIS

02:34:32.764 --> 02:34:35.633 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE BODY AGAIN IT LOOKS

02:34:34.565 --> 02:34:37.368 region:rollup2
LIKE IN THE FUTURE FOR

02:34:35.633 --> 02:34:38.269 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:34:37.368 --> 02:34:38.903 region:rollup2
IN YOUR OPINION DO YOU THINK

02:34:38.269 --> 02:34:40.605 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD ABIDE BY THE LAWS

02:34:38.903 --> 02:34:41.706 region:rollup2
THAT WE PASS.

02:34:40.605 --> 02:34:44.509 region:rollup2
SO THAT THERE'S A BASE.

02:34:41.706 --> 02:34:46.844 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:34:44.509 --> 02:34:47.979 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEE TO KNOW THAT HEY I

02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:49.380 region:rollup2
AT LEAST I HAVE THESE LAWS ON MY

02:34:47.979 --> 02:34:50.414 region:rollup2
SIDE TO START WITH.

02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:53.151 region:rollup2
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF YOU WORK

02:34:50.414 --> 02:34:54.585 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE.

02:34:53.151 --> 02:34:55.887 region:rollup2
WE HAVE EXEMPT OURSELVES IN THE

02:34:54.585 --> 02:35:01.692 region:rollup2
LOS THE LABOR LAWS THAT WE'VE

02:34:55.887 --> 02:35:03.728 region:rollup2
PAST IS STATE.

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:08.199 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO ANSWER

02:35:03.728 --> 02:35:10.735 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T.

02:35:08.199 --> 02:35:15.540 region:rollup2
BOB ABOUT THE STATE'S OPTIC

02:35:10.735 --> 02:35:18.943 region:rollup2
ASIDE AND. NO I I I I DO THINK

02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:19.277 region:rollup2
THAT AS I'VE SAID A COUPLE OF

02:35:18.943 --> 02:35:20.378 region:rollup2
TIMES I THINK.

02:35:19.277 --> 02:35:23.481 region:rollup2
.

02:35:20.378 --> 02:35:24.615 region:rollup2
PEOPLE JUDGE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO

02:35:23.481 --> 02:35:25.550 region:rollup2
AND NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU SAY

02:35:24.615 --> 02:35:26.851 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE STANDARD AND ONE

02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:29.220 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS THAT THERE IS A

02:35:26.851 --> 02:35:30.855 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF A DISCONNECT.

02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:32.456 region:rollup2
IT WITH IS THAT YOU HAVE THIS

02:35:30.855 --> 02:35:33.958 region:rollup2
LAW THAT APPLIES HERE NOT ENOUGH

02:35:32.456 --> 02:35:34.859 region:rollup2
THIS BUT TO BE FAIR THERE ARE

02:35:33.958 --> 02:35:36.394 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR

02:35:34.859 --> 02:35:36.827 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT

02:35:36.394 --> 02:35:38.429 region:rollup2
RULES FOR DIFFERENT

02:35:36.827 --> 02:35:39.530 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES SO FRANKLY FROM MY

02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:40.631 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WHAT I WOULD DO. IS

02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:41.165 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A

02:35:40.631 --> 02:35:42.967 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IF THERE IS A

02:35:41.165 --> 02:35:44.869 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATE REASON FOR TREATING

02:35:42.967 --> 02:35:46.103 region:rollup2
FOR EXEMPTING YOU FROM A

02:35:44.869 --> 02:35:47.838 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR LAW THEN YOU SHOULD

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:49.707 region:rollup2
GO TO GREAT LENGTHS.

02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:50.308 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN WHY BECAUSE IF THERE IS

02:35:49.707 --> 02:35:51.375 region:rollup2
IF IT'S PURELY BECAUSE WE DO

02:35:50.308 --> 02:35:53.377 region:rollup2
THINK

02:35:51.375 --> 02:35:54.712 region:rollup2
WE ARE ABOVE THE LAW THEN THAT'S

02:35:53.377 --> 02:35:55.580 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

02:35:54.712 --> 02:35:57.048 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND IT BLEEDS INTO

02:35:55.580 --> 02:35:57.882 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT'S WHY.

02:35:57.048 --> 02:35:58.983 region:rollup2
YOU WILL HAVE SOME OF THE

02:35:57.882 --> 02:36:00.251 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAVE IN

02:35:58.983 --> 02:36:01.552 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE HARASSMENT GENERALLY

02:36:00.251 --> 02:36:03.221 region:rollup2
BUT IF THERE IS A REALLY

02:36:01.552 --> 02:36:05.723 region:rollup2
COMPELLING REASON FOR WHY THERE

02:36:03.221 --> 02:36:06.991 region:rollup2
ARE REASONS WHY YOUR RULES THAT

02:36:05.723 --> 02:36:07.758 region:rollup2
AND THEN OTHER RULES. THAT YOU

02:36:06.991 --> 02:36:09.427 region:rollup2
JUST EXPLAINED IT AND THAT'S

02:36:07.758 --> 02:36:10.394 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CULTURE IS

02:36:09.427 --> 02:36:13.664 region:rollup2
EXPLAINING IT TO PEOPLE SO THEY

02:36:10.394 --> 02:36:15.933 region:rollup2
BUY INTO.

02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:16.133 region:rollup2
SO BEFORE I GO TO SENATOR BATES

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:17.869 region:rollup2
SIDE.

02:36:16.133 --> 02:36:20.538 region:rollup2
IT MADE ME THINK OF A QUESTION

02:36:17.869 --> 02:36:22.173 region:rollup2
THIS IS A. DIFFICULT QUESTION

02:36:20.538 --> 02:36:22.373 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IS TO COME OUT OF LEFT

02:36:22.173 --> 02:36:23.674 region:rollup2
FIELD.

02:36:22.373 --> 02:36:24.275 region:rollup2
.

02:36:23.674 --> 02:36:25.343 region:rollup2
SO SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED

02:36:24.275 --> 02:36:27.645 region:rollup2
THAT THE SOLUTION TO THIS IS TO

02:36:25.343 --> 02:36:29.313 region:rollup2
ALLOW THE EMPLOYEES. THAT WORK

02:36:27.645 --> 02:36:30.248 region:rollup2

02:36:36.721 --> 02:36:38.356 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY AN UNFAIR

02:36:37.655 --> 02:36:40.157 region:rollup2

RETALIATION.

02:41:53.971 --> 02:41:59.076 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS TRAINING GOES.

02:41:57.441 --> 02:42:01.145 region:rollup2
ONE THING AGAIN THEY DIFFERED

02:41:59.076 --> 02:42:02.313 region:rollup2
GREATLY IN IN QUALITY BUT ALMOST

02:42:05.416 --> 02:42:07.885 region:rollup2
BUT AFTER CONSULTING WITH NC

02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:09.019 region:rollup2
SALES TRAINERS AND EXPERTS ARE

02:42:07.885 --> 02:42:10.621 region:rollup2
REVIEWING OUR SURVEYS WE HAVE

02:42:09.019 --> 02:42:11.822 region:rollup2
THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS AS

WELL.

02:42:11.822 --> 02:42:14.558 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANT ALL AGAIN.

02:42:13.624 --> 02:42:15.893 region:rollup2
IS THAT MUCH LIKE CHANGING THE

02:42:14.558 --> 02:42:17.261 region:rollup2
CULTURE LEGISLATURE TRAINING IS

02:42:15.893 --> 02:42:19.163 region:rollup2
THAT'S MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN THE

LEADERSHIP IS FULLY ENGAGED AND

02:42:19.163 --> 02:42:21.732 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE OF THE TRAINING IT

02:42:20.264 --> 02:42:22.967 region:rollup2
SENDS A MESSAGE TO EVERYONE ELSE

02:42:21.732 --> 02:42:24.635 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS

02:42:22.967 --> 02:42:26.637 region:rollup2
DONE IN THAT THERE. ARE ON BOARD

NO A RECEPTIVE MEMBER OF OF THE

02:42:26.637 --> 02:42:29.106 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

02:42:28.439 --> 02:42:30.541 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TRAINERS IN

02:42:29.106 --> 02:42:33.444 region:rollup2
CORPORATE LEGISLATIVE SPECIFIC

02:42:30.541 --> 02:42:34.778 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES AT AS ALL OF YOU KNOW.

02:42:33.444 --> 02:42:36.180 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT A LEGISLATOR FROM

02:42:34.778 --> 02:42:37.481 region:rollup2
EIGHT AM TO FIVE PM YOUR

02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:39.049 region:rollup2

ALWAYS.

02:42:40.551 --> 02:42:44.121 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING YOURSELF AND SO

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:45.856 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IMPROVE THAT

02:42:44.121 --> 02:42:47.391 region:rollup2
INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC THAT

02:42:45.856 --> 02:42:48.792 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS IN THE EVENING.

02:42:47.391 --> 02:42:49.927 region:rollup2
DOES SHOW ALSO NEED BE ACCOUNTED

02:42:48.792 --> 02:42:52.263 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE NEED TO FULLY

02:42:49.927 --> 02:42:53.297 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WORKS OUT TO

02:42:52.263 --> 02:42:55.633 region:rollup2
THAT NOTE IT'S ALSO SOMETIMES

02:42:53.297 --> 02:42:56.967 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO SEPARATE STAFF AND

02:42:55.633 --> 02:42:58.269 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS FROM TRAINING

02:42:56.967 --> 02:43:00.271 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE UNIQUE. POWER

02:42:58.269 --> 02:43:01.939 region:rollup2
DYNAMICS AND THE UNIQUENESS OF

02:43:00.271 --> 02:43:04.375 region:rollup2
THE JOBS.

02:43:01.939 --> 02:43:05.009 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS WE CAME ACROSS IN

02:43:04.375 --> 02:43:06.143 region:rollup2
OCTOBER.

02:43:05.009 --> 02:43:06.944 region:rollup2
IT WON'T SHOCK YOU TO HEAR THE

02:43:06.143 --> 02:43:08.545 region:rollup2
MOST THESE POLICIES ALREADY

02:43:06.944 --> 02:43:10.814 region:rollup2
OUTDATED BY THE TIME TWO

02:43:08.545 --> 02:43:11.849 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CAME AROUND.

02:43:10.814 --> 02:43:12.883 region:rollup2
SO FAR WERE A REBEL LEVIN

02:43:11.849 --> 02:43:14.785 region:rollup2
STATES THAT IMPLEMENTED OR

02:43:12.883 --> 02:43:16.420 region:rollup2
INTRODUCE NEW POLICIES.

02:43:14.785 --> 02:43:18.922 region:rollup2
CHAMBER RULES ARE ETHICS RULES

02:43:16.420 --> 02:43:20.491 region:rollup2
AND I EXPECT. MOSTLY ALL IF NOT

02:43:18.922 --> 02:43:22.026 region:rollup2
ALL STATES TO BE REVIEWING THE

02:43:20.491 --> 02:43:23.494 region:rollup2
POLICIES AS SESSIONS KEEP ON

02:43:22.026 --> 02:43:25.429 region:rollup2
COMING IN.

02:43:23.494 --> 02:43:26.864 region:rollup2
MOST THE CHANGES OF THESE

02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:28.265 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ARE MINOR SO FAR.

02:43:26.864 --> 02:43:30.067 region:rollup2
THEY USUALLY JUST CLARIFY

02:43:28.265 --> 02:43:31.835 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES ALREADY IN PLACE OF

02:43:30.067 --> 02:43:34.672 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE MEXICO CHANGE TO

02:43:38.942 --> 02:43:41.145 region:rollup2
FEELING HARASSED THE LEGISLATOR

02:43:40.611 --> 02:43:42.980 region:rollup2
EVEN A THIRD PARTY LIKE A

02:43:41.145 --> 02:43:45.115 region:rollup2
LOBBYIST.

02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:45.582 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THOSE POLICIES

UNPRECEDENTED OUT OF LEGISLATION

02:43:47.551 --> 02:43:50.688 region:rollup2
AS WELL ABOUT TYPICALLY THERE

02:43:49.086 --> 02:43:51.188 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HARDLY ANY LEGISLATION

02:43:50.688 --> 02:43:52.856 region:rollup2
IS A SAMPLE TO POLICIES

02:43:51.188 --> 02:43:54.591 region:rollup2
INTERNAL.

PUSHING HER BY.

02:44:59.923 --> 02:45:02.326 region:rollup2
WELL MY AT MY WILL BE VERY CLEAR

02:45:01.358 --> 02:45:04.895 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S A KIND OF AN

02:45:02.326 --> 02:45:04.895 region:rollup2
INTERESTING SITUATION THAT WE

02:45:04.962 --> 02:45:08.398 region:rollup2
WITH JOHN AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF

02:45:06.964 --> 02:45:10.167 region:rollup2

LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:45:11.502 --> 02:45:15.372 region:rollup2
SO RATHER THAN ELEVATE THOSE TO

02:45:13.537 --> 02:45:17.274 region:rollup2
A POLICE COMMISSION ALL ABOUT WE

02:45:15.372 --> 02:45:19.076 region:rollup2
WERE SEEKING OTHER WAYS TO BRING

02:45:17.274 --> 02:45:20.911 region:rollup2
RECONCILIATION.

02:45:19.076 --> 02:45:22.780 region:rollup2
TO THE SITUATION.

02:45:20.911 --> 02:45:24.882 region:rollup2
AND CREATED A POLICE COMMUNITY

02:45:22.780 --> 02:45:26.483 region:rollup2
RECONCILIATION PROGRAM.

02:45:24.882 --> 02:45:27.518 region:rollup2
AND WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL WHO

02:45:26.483 --> 02:45:28.886 region:rollup2
FELT THEY'D BEEN HARASSED IN

02:45:27.518 --> 02:45:30.587 region:rollup2
THESE

02:45:28.886 --> 02:45:31.789 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW APPROACH THINGS THAT

02:45:30.587 --> 02:45:33.190 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WOULD BE DEBT VERY

02:45:31.789 --> 02:45:35.125 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:37.594 region:rollup2
OFFICERS CAREER.

02:45:35.125 --> 02:45:39.430 region:rollup2
THEY VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATED

02:45:37.594 --> 02:45:41.865 region:rollup2
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE DEAD.

02:45:39.430 --> 02:45:43.233 region:rollup2
SO THE QUESTION IS IS THERE A

02:45:41.865 --> 02:45:44.968 region:rollup2
PLACE IN IN THE.

02:45:43.233 --> 02:45:45.969 region:rollup2
TOOLS THAT WE WILL HAVE AS WE

02:45:44.968 --> 02:45:47.671 region:rollup2
GO FORWARD.

02:45:45.969 --> 02:45:49.540 region:rollup2
THAT A RECONCILIATION PROCESS

02:45:47.671 --> 02:45:51.742 region:rollup2
CAN WORK WHEN YOU HAVE THIS

02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:53.944 region:rollup2
POWER BASE

02:45:51.742 --> 02:45:56.346 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE WOULD BE HARD FOR.

02:45:53.944 --> 02:45:58.282 region:rollup2
CA I AM A.

02:45:56.346 --> 02:46:00.184 region:rollup2
STAFFORD TO A LEGISLATOR AND I

02:45:58.282 --> 02:46:02.252 region:rollup2
FEEL I'VE BEEN HARASSED.

SEXUALLY OR ANY OTHER WAY.

02:46:02.252 --> 02:46:05.956 region:rollup2
DO YOU AYE AYE REPORT IT AND

02:46:03.821 --> 02:46:07.958 region:rollup2
THEN I HAVE TO ASK IF THAT

02:46:05.956 --> 02:46:09.460 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL SIT DOWN WITH ME AND

02:46:07.958 --> 02:46:11.562 region:rollup2
WE CAN WORK THROUGH OUR PROBLEMS

02:46:09.460 --> 02:46:12.796 region:rollup2
AND THAT REALLY. I JUST THE

02:46:11.562 --> 02:46:14.631 region:rollup2
POWER RELATIONSHIP

02:46:12.796 --> 02:46:16.667 region:rollup2
THAT IT WORKED.

02:46:14.631 --> 02:46:17.301 region:rollup2
WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO CAN'T

02:46:16.667 --> 02:46:20.571 region:rollup2
WORK HERE AND HAVE YOU EVER USE

02:46:17.301 --> 02:46:22.239 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:46:20.571 --> 02:46:23.841 region:rollup2
UNOFFICIALLYAND AND IN SOME

02:46:22.239 --> 02:46:25.542 region:rollup2
CASES OFFICIALLY THAT'S BEEN THE

02:46:23.841 --> 02:46:27.411 region:rollup2
ROLE OF HR.

02:46:25.542 --> 02:46:28.946 region:rollup2
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IF

02:46:56.139 --> 02:46:59.643 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOMETIMES.

02:46:58.008 --> 02:47:00.844 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON'S DEFINITION OF

02:46:59.643 --> 02:47:02.179 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT MAY BE YOU KNOW THE

02:47:00.844 --> 02:47:02.779 region:rollup2
LAY PERSON'S DEFINITION OF

02:47:02.179 --> 02:47:04.915 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IS NOT ALWAYS LEGAL

02:47:02.779 --> 02:47:07.050 region:rollup2
HARASSED.

02:47:04.915 --> 02:47:08.452 region:rollup2
THAT I WAS WITH. THE SENATOR ON

02:47:07.050 --> 02:47:11.088 region:rollup2
A TRIP.

02:47:08.452 --> 02:47:11.688 region:rollup2
AND SHE NEEDED X. THAT MORNING

02:47:11.088 --> 02:47:13.023 region:rollup2
SHE ASKED ME TO GO OUT AND GET

02:47:11.688 --> 02:47:14.825 region:rollup2
IT.

02:47:13.023 --> 02:47:17.227 region:rollup2
AND I FELT HARASSED BY.

02:47:14.825 --> 02:47:18.896 region:rollup2
IN SO WE OFTENTIMES BY NATURE

02:47:17.227 --> 02:47:20.731 region:rollup2
FUNCTION PUTTING THE TWO PARTIES

02:47:18.896 --> 02:47:21.798 region:rollup2
IN THE ROOM WILL REALIZE THAT IS

02:47:20.731 --> 02:47:23.133 region:rollup2
EITHER MISC UNDERSEA IT'S

02:47:21.798 --> 02:47:24.434 region:rollup2
MISCOMMUNICATION

02:47:23.133 --> 02:47:26.436 region:rollup2
MISUNDERSTANDING MULTI

02:47:24.434 --> 02:47:28.372 region:rollup2
GENERATIONAL CONVERSATIONS

02:47:26.436 --> 02:47:29.606 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE WAY THAT WE TALK IS

02:47:28.372 --> 02:47:31.875 region:rollup2
NOT THE WAY A TWENTY ONE YEAR

02:47:29.606 --> 02:47:33.143 region:rollup2
OLD OX. AND SO A LOT OF THAT IS

02:47:31.875 --> 02:47:35.345 region:rollup2
AT PLAY THERE SOME REAL POWER

02:47:33.143 --> 02:47:37.314 region:rollup2
DYNAMICS THERE WE HAVE FOUND

02:47:35.345 --> 02:47:39.216 region:rollup2
THAT HR CAN ACTUALLY SERVE IN

02:47:37.314 --> 02:47:41.919 region:rollup2
THAT OFFICIAL RECONCILIATION

02:47:39.216 --> 02:47:42.986 region:rollup2
ROLE AND IF WE WORK WELL THROUGH

02:47:41.919 --> 02:47:44.288 region:rollup2
THIS WE KEEP BOTH TALENT.

02:47:42.986 --> 02:47:45.989 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T IT'S NOT AN

02:47:44.288 --> 02:47:47.324 region:rollup2
EITHER OR THAT'S THE PROBLEM

02:47:45.989 --> 02:47:49.293 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GET INTO THE TREE IN

02:47:47.324 --> 02:47:51.094 region:rollup2
THE REAL ADVERSARIAL KIND OF

02:47:49.293 --> 02:47:52.596 region:rollup2
SOMEONE HAS TO WIN AND SOMEONE

02:47:51.094 --> 02:47:54.398 region:rollup2
HAS TO LOSE AND GOD FOR BID

02:47:52.596 --> 02:47:56.767 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT NO LAWYER INVOLVED.

02:47:54.398 --> 02:47:57.301 region:rollup2
AS WELL HAD BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:47:56.767 --> 02:47:58.902 region:rollup2
MAKE MONEY IF YOU TO JUST

02:47:57.301 --> 02:48:00.270 region:rollup2
RECORD.

02:47:58.902 --> 02:48:01.805 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ANGLE THE

02:48:00.270 --> 02:48:03.240 region:rollup2
ANGLE IS YOU NEED TO LOSE SO

02:48:01.805 --> 02:48:04.641 region:rollup2
THAT I CAN GET MY THIRD OR

02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:05.776 region:rollup2
WHATEVER I KNOW CALIFORNIA. HAS

02:48:04.641 --> 02:48:07.377 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WHO YOU KNOW A

02:48:05.776 --> 02:48:09.012 region:rollup2
CONTINGENCY RULES BUT THEREIN

02:48:07.377 --> 02:48:11.281 region:rollup2
LIES THE PROBLEM IS ONCE IT'S

02:48:09.012 --> 02:48:13.951 region:rollup2
GONE EXTERNAL AN ADVERSARIAL

02:48:11.281 --> 02:48:15.419 region:rollup2
YOU'VE A REAL YOUR ABILITY TO

02:48:13.951 --> 02:48:17.087 region:rollup2
MANAGE IT NOT CONTROLLING

02:48:15.419 --> 02:48:18.188 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE CONTROL SUGGEST

02:48:17.087 --> 02:48:19.756 region:rollup2
THAT YOU TRY TO HIDE IT.

02:48:18.188 --> 02:48:20.958 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT IT'S JUST SOMETIMES THE

02:48:19.756 --> 02:48:23.093 region:rollup2
PARTIES HAVE MISSED EACH OTHER

02:48:20.958 --> 02:48:24.661 region:rollup2
IN PASSING AND THERE'S A PROBLEM

02:48:23.093 --> 02:48:25.762 region:rollup2
THERE AND WHEN YOU DEAL WITH

02:48:24.661 --> 02:48:27.164 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD SAY PUT TALENTS

02:48:25.762 --> 02:48:28.365 region:rollup2
ALONG ITS I'VE SEEN THAT WORK WE

02:48:27.164 --> 02:48:29.866 region:rollup2
DON'T CALL IT RECONCILIATION

02:48:28.365 --> 02:48:31.702 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS BECAUSE YOU. TITLE

02:48:29.866 --> 02:48:33.270 region:rollup2
SEVEN OF THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

02:48:31.702 --> 02:48:34.671 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES THE SEA SAYS YOU

02:48:33.270 --> 02:48:36.440 region:rollup2
CAN'T WORK AROUND OUR PROCESS

02:48:34.671 --> 02:48:37.741 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY AND

02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:40.110 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN IT WORK IS A STRONG

02:48:37.741 --> 02:48:42.145 region:rollup2
HR FUNCTION WILL GENERALLY GET

02:48:40.110 --> 02:48:43.714 region:rollup2
YOU TO THAT PRETTY QUICKLY.

02:48:42.145 --> 02:48:44.881 region:rollup2
AND I JUST LIKE TO ADD UP THE

02:48:43.714 --> 02:48:46.583 region:rollup2
STATE OR IN ACTUALLY IN THEIR

02:48:44.881 --> 02:48:48.518 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IS A VERY STRONG

02:48:46.583 --> 02:48:50.420 region:rollup2
INFORMAL COMPLAINT PROCESS. AND

02:48:48.518 --> 02:48:51.221 region:rollup2
AGAIN I THINK THIS THIS LEADS TO

02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:52.489 region:rollup2
THERE'S YOU KNOW KIND OF A

02:48:51.221 --> 02:48:53.757 region:rollup2
GENERAL IDEA THAT MOST THE TIME

02:48:52.489 --> 02:48:54.391 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU MAKE A COMPLAINT.

02:48:53.757 --> 02:48:56.293 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR RESULT IS

02:48:54.391 --> 02:48:58.228 region:rollup2
WHAT BEHAVIORS STOP.

02:48:56.293 --> 02:48:59.529 region:rollup2
AND AS LONG AS YOU HAVE AN HR

02:48:58.228 --> 02:49:01.331 region:rollup2
FONG AT AGE OUR COMMUNITY THAT

02:48:59.529 --> 02:49:02.432 region:rollup2
FEELS EMPOWERED TO DO SO THAT

02:49:01.331 --> 02:49:03.533 region:rollup2
SHOULD ALWAYS BE AN OPTION.

02:49:02.432 --> 02:49:04.801 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT

02:49:03.533 --> 02:49:06.703 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PUT THAT INTO THEIR

02:49:04.801 --> 02:49:08.672 region:rollup2
POLICY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

02:49:06.703 --> 02:49:09.439 region:rollup2
ARE AWARE AGAIN THAT.

02:49:08.672 --> 02:49:10.707 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT IN THIS DOZEN

02:49:09.439 --> 02:49:12.876 region:rollup2
DICTATORS ALL THERE'S THERE'S A

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:14.277 region:rollup2
LOT OF WAYS TO HANDLE COMPLY.

02:49:12.876 --> 02:49:15.212 region:rollup2
CAN I JUST RAISE IT BECAUSE LIKE

02:49:14.277 --> 02:49:17.047 region:rollup2
INCOME THE DUE PROCESS AND

02:49:15.212 --> 02:49:19.883 region:rollup2
ACCUSED.

02:49:19.883 --> 02:49:23.086 region:rollup2
HA IF THEY THROW MY GOD I DIDN'T

02:49:21.818 --> 02:49:24.321 region:rollup2

IN THIS FIELD WHAT DO YOU THINK

WELL THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

02:50:39.629 --> 02:50:44.701 region:rollup2
IT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR GOOD

02:50:42.265 --> 02:50:45.736 region:rollup2

I'VE I'VE WHILE I APPRECIATE AND

UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE GOING

02:50:58.315 --> 02:51:02.018 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THERE IS A TON OF RISK

02:51:00.784 --> 02:51:02.586 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK REALLY GOOD PEOPLE

02:51:02.018 --> 02:51:04.287 region:rollup2
MIGHT DECIDE NOT TO DO THIS

02:51:02.586 --> 02:51:05.322 region:rollup2
WORK.

02:51:04.287 --> 02:51:06.623 region:rollup2
IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA

02:51:05.322 --> 02:51:08.458 region:rollup2
SUBJECT THE PERSONAL ASSETS

02:51:06.623 --> 02:51:10.060 region:rollup2
TO EXPOSURE.

02:51:08.458 --> 02:51:11.628 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE AYE FUNDAMENTALLY

02:51:10.060 --> 02:51:12.963 region:rollup2
STARTED BELIEVING IN PEOPLE I

02:51:11.628 --> 02:51:15.031 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW BAD ACTORS

02:51:12.963 --> 02:51:17.234 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD HATE TO PROPOSE

02:51:15.031 --> 02:51:19.936 region:rollup2
POLICY OR. FOR POLICIES THAT

02:51:17.234 --> 02:51:21.638 region:rollup2
WOULD HARM OR HAVE THE IMPACT OF

02:51:19.936 --> 02:51:22.939 region:rollup2
MAKING THE NINETY FIVE PERCENT

02:51:21.638 --> 02:51:24.274 region:rollup2
OF US WHO WILL FOLLOW THE RULES

02:51:22.939 --> 02:51:25.575 region:rollup2
SAY YOU KNOW IT'S JUST NOT WORTH

02:51:24.274 --> 02:51:27.177 region:rollup2
IT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO.

02:51:25.575 --> 02:51:30.514 region:rollup2
MORTGAGE MY HOUSE WOULD GIVE UP

02:51:27.177 --> 02:51:31.448 region:rollup2
MY EXPORT THIS RISK. AND ONE OF

02:51:30.514 --> 02:51:32.916 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT I SAW IN

02:51:31.448 --> 02:51:34.851 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

02:51:32.916 --> 02:51:36.620 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S REALLY

02:51:34.851 --> 02:51:37.420 region:rollup2
TOUGH TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:39.256 region:rollup2
HAVE SETTLED SEXUAL HARASSMENT

02:51:37.420 --> 02:51:41.391 region:rollup2
CLAIMS.

02:51:39.256 --> 02:51:42.592 region:rollup2
AND I'M TALKING FROM BUSINESS

02:51:41.391 --> 02:51:44.161 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS MAKES THE DECISION

02:51:42.592 --> 02:51:46.696 region:rollup2
TO DO IT.

02:51:44.161 --> 02:51:48.498 region:rollup2
NOT THE INDIVIDUAL IT'S NOT IN

02:51:46.696 --> 02:51:49.1000 region:rollup2
THE BEST INTEREST OF PARAMOUNT

02:51:48.498 --> 02:51:52.769 region:rollup2
PICTURES TO BE ALL OVER THE NEW

02:51:49.1000 --> 02:51:55.238 region:rollup2
SO WE SOLVE PER THAT PROBLEM.

02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:56.907 region:rollup2
AND WE RESOLVE IT EVEN IF ONE OF

02:51:55.238 --> 02:51:58.642 region:rollup2
OUR EXECUTIVES DECIDED THEY

02:51:56.907 --> 02:52:00.410 region:rollup2
WANTED TO FIGHT IT FIGHT IT TO

02:51:58.642 --> 02:52:01.611 region:rollup2
THE END AND THAT'S THE REALITY

02:52:00.410 --> 02:52:03.413 region:rollup2
AND I THINK YOU WILL BE

02:52:01.611 --> 02:52:05.048 region:rollup2
CONFRONTED WITH SOMETHING. VERY

02:52:03.413 --> 02:52:06.583 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THAT I THINK ABOUT

02:52:05.048 --> 02:52:08.485 region:rollup2
THE WOMAN WHO RAN FOR CONGRESS

02:52:06.583 --> 02:52:09.719 region:rollup2
WAS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN

02:52:08.485 --> 02:52:11.388 region:rollup2

INTERESTINGLY

02:52:16.693 --> 02:52:20.397 region:rollup2

MNA THEY SETTLED THE CLAIM

02:52:33.710 --> 02:52:37.981 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HER.

02:52:36.046 --> 02:52:39.049 region:rollup2

02:52:39.049 --> 02:52:41.885 region:rollup2

BASE OF WEALTH NO JUST IT'S NOT

02:53:06.576 --> 02:53:10.513 region:rollup2
WORTH IT AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE

02:53:08.778 --> 02:53:11.648 region:rollup2
IS EVEN WHEN IT DOESHAPPEN IF

02:53:10.513 --> 02:53:13.383 region:rollup2

THE UNDERLYING CLAIM.

02:53:19.589 --> 02:53:22.192 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE AS A

02:53:20.657 --> 02:53:23.994 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONER.

02:53:22.192 --> 02:53:25.495 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY DEALING IN

02:53:23.994 --> 02:53:27.063 region:rollup2
REALITY YOU'D BE NICE TO FIGHT

02:53:25.495 --> 02:53:30.166 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE END BUT SOMETIMES JUST

02:53:27.063 --> 02:53:33.036 region:rollup2

ISSUES AND THE NEW WANTS AND

02:53:37.607 --> 02:53:41.177 region:rollup2
ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR.

02:53:39.409 --> 02:53:42.979 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES EVEN

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:44.481 region:rollup2
WITH THINGS THAT ON THEIR FACE

02:53:42.979 --> 02:53:45.982 region:rollup2
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

02:53:44.481 --> 02:53:47.417 region:rollup2
WHICH SEEMS TO HAPPEN A LOT

02:53:45.982 --> 02:53:48.451 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING SORT OF WITH

02:53:47.417 --> 02:53:50.020 region:rollup2
THE LEGAL ROUND.

02:53:48.451 --> 02:53:50.620 region:rollup2
AND JUST YOU KNOW TRYING TO

02:53:50.020 --> 02:53:52.589 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE WHERE THINGS MIGHT

02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:54.190 region:rollup2
GO.

02:53:52.589 --> 02:53:58.395 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS FOR FINAL PANEL

02:53:54.190 --> 02:54:00.030 region:rollup2

IN BEYOND IT SAID.

02:54:04.868 --> 02:54:08.204 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE END

02:54:06.636 --> 02:54:10.373 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FEW

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:13.176 region:rollup2
STATES THAT MANDATES SEXUAL

02:54:10.373 --> 02:54:14.210 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT TRAINING BY STATUTE.

02:54:13.176 --> 02:54:15.979 region:rollup2
YET WE FIND OURSELVES IN A

02:54:14.210 --> 02:54:18.114 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHEREIN.

02:54:15.979 --> 02:54:19.716 region:rollup2
UP WOULD YOU AGREE THAT. I'M

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:21.184 region:rollup2

02:54:19.716 --> 02:54:23.653 region:rollup2
PANELISTS BEFORE YOU.

02:54:21.184 --> 02:54:25.155 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT CULTURE.

02:54:23.653 --> 02:54:26.756 region:rollup2
AND TO THE FACT THAT IT REALLY

02:54:25.155 --> 02:54:29.459 region:rollup2
IS AN ISSUE OF CULTURE BEFORE IT

02:54:26.756 --> 02:54:31.127 region:rollup2
IS ANYTHING ELSE.

02:54:29.459 --> 02:54:31.594 region:rollup2
YES I THINK ABSOLUTELY I THINK

02:54:31.127 --> 02:54:33.997 region:rollup2
AS.

02:54:31.594 --> 02:54:35.732 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR DAN HARTZ SAID ABOUT

IN HER PRESENTATION CULTURE EATS

02:54:35.732 --> 02:54:39.202 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE UP.

02:54:36.967 --> 02:54:40.603 region:rollup2
THEIR CULTURES IS THE OVER

02:54:39.202 --> 02:54:42.372 region:rollup2
ARCHING THAT'S AGAIN WHY I THINK

02:54:40.603 --> 02:54:43.707 region:rollup2
THIS IS SUCH A POSITIVE FROM

02:54:42.372 --> 02:54:44.908 region:rollup2
FROM THE TO SONY CARES ABOUT THE

LEGISLATIVE INSTITUTIONS SUCH A

02:54:44.908 --> 02:54:49.179 region:rollup2
POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE

02:54:46.543 --> 02:54:51.414 region:rollup2
SEEING THAT CULTURE IS REALLY.

02:54:49.179 --> 02:54:52.382 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP AND YOU

02:54:51.414 --> 02:54:53.950 region:rollup2
DON'T LEADERSHIP BY AND THOSE

02:54:52.382 --> 02:54:55.285 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE REALLY WOULD HELP SET

02:54:53.950 --> 02:54:55.885 region:rollup2
THE TONE THE MOST MORE THAN

02:54:55.285 --> 02:54:58.488 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN COME UP

02:54:55.885 --> 02:54:59.756 region:rollup2
WITH.

02:54:58.488 --> 02:55:01.691 region:rollup2
AND ALSO WHAT DISCIPLINE ESSAYS

02:54:59.756 --> 02:55:02.926 region:rollup2

THAT MANDATES TRAINING IS AGAIN

02:55:02.926 --> 02:55:05.195 region:rollup2
WHY WE HAD NEVER SEEN

02:55:04.094 --> 02:55:07.030 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION REALLY ON THIS

02:55:05.195 --> 02:55:07.964 region:rollup2

SINCE WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS

02:55:17.807 --> 02:55:19.709 region:rollup2
DEALT WITH LEGISLATURE'S

02:55:18.942 --> 02:55:20.944 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY I THOUGHT

02:55:19.709 --> 02:55:22.746 region:rollup2
IT WAS APPROPRIATE KIND OF

02:55:20.944 --> 02:55:25.615 region:rollup2
CIRCLE BACK WITH. WHAT WE

02:55:22.746 --> 02:55:28.418 region:rollup2
STARTED OFF THE HEARING ABOUT?

02:55:25.615 --> 02:55:31.021 region:rollup2
TALKING MORE ABOUT DESIGNING

02:55:28.418 --> 02:55:34.023 region:rollup2
DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONS.

02:55:31.021 --> 02:55:36.326 region:rollup2
AS OAK POTENTIAL GOAL TO.

02:55:34.023 --> 02:55:37.327 region:rollup2
STEM YOU KNOW THIS

02:55:36.326 --> 02:55:39.295 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS.

02:55:37.327 --> 02:55:41.064 region:rollup2
.

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:42.499 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING MORE WOMEN TO SERVE

02:55:41.064 --> 02:55:44.868 region:rollup2
IN CAPACITIES.

02:55:42.499 --> 02:55:45.435 region:rollup2
.

02:55:44.868 --> 02:55:47.237 region:rollup2
I THINK IN THE MY I MIGHT BE

02:55:45.435 --> 02:55:49.239 region:rollup2
OFF.

02:55:47.237 --> 02:55:51.641 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE JUST.

02:55:49.239 --> 02:55:52.675 region:rollup2
BURDEN WHEN THE ISN'T A NEW

02:55:51.641 --> 02:55:53.209 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE AND I THINK THIS

02:55:52.675 --> 02:55:54.944 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX OR TWENTY SEVEN

02:55:53.209 --> 02:55:56.813 region:rollup2
WOMEN.

02:55:54.944 --> 02:55:58.181 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY SERVING OUT OF A

02:55:56.813 --> 02:55:59.449 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY.

02:55:58.181 --> 02:56:01.217 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE POSITIONS

02:55:59.449 --> 02:56:03.686 region:rollup2
SO IT'S.

02:56:01.217 --> 02:56:04.654 region:rollup2
AMONG SOLOISTS.

02:56:03.686 --> 02:56:06.556 region:rollup2
IF FOR A STATE SINCE NINETEEN

02:56:04.654 --> 02:56:07.857 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT.

02:56:06.556 --> 02:56:10.026 region:rollup2
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN OR HAVE YOU

02:56:07.857 --> 02:56:11.661 region:rollup2
SEEN IN OTHER STATES?

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:12.896 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE MORE WOMEN TO

02:56:11.661 --> 02:56:13.129 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE LEGISLATIVE

02:56:12.896 --> 02:56:15.198 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:56:13.129 --> 02:56:16.066 region:rollup2
.

02:56:15.198 --> 02:56:18.735 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH

02:56:16.066 --> 02:56:21.404 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IT'S IS SO BIG.

02:56:18.735 --> 02:56:23.206 region:rollup2
THAT A LOT OF WOMEN. YOU KNOW.

02:56:21.404 --> 02:56:25.442 region:rollup2
AND THE STRUCTURE IS SO OUT OF

02:56:23.206 --> 02:56:26.543 region:rollup2
DATE HOW WE DO OUR PROCEDURES

02:56:25.442 --> 02:56:28.211 region:rollup2
AND OPERATIONS THAT IT

02:56:26.543 --> 02:56:29.946 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGES WOMEN BECAUSE IT'S

02:56:28.211 --> 02:56:34.384 region:rollup2
NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY IT'S

02:56:29.946 --> 02:56:36.519 region:rollup2
INFLEXIBLE. TO A TEE TO SERVE.

02:56:34.384 --> 02:56:38.988 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW IF YOUR MOM IS VERY

TIME OFF TO THE EVEN STAY IN THE

02:56:43.426 --> 02:56:47.464 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

02:56:45.628 --> 02:56:50.066 region:rollup2
THAT DISCOURAGES WOMEN WHAT HAVE

02:56:47.464 --> 02:56:52.302 region:rollup2

02:56:50.066 --> 02:56:54.671 region:rollup2
EFFORTS IN OTHER STATES.

TO WORK ON THE MORE DIVERSE MORE

02:56:54.671 --> 02:56:59.709 region:rollup2
EQUITABLE MORE. FLEXIBLE.

02:56:58.174 --> 02:57:01.578 region:rollup2
COURSE IF YOU LIVE IN A SMALLER

02:56:59.709 --> 02:57:02.745 region:rollup2
STATUS EASY TO COME INVOLVEMENT

02:57:01.578 --> 02:57:04.380 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM VERY

02:57:02.745 --> 02:57:05.515 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:07.350 region:rollup2
YEAH I'M I MEAN I WOULD SAY EVEN

02:57:05.515 --> 02:57:09.486 region:rollup2
UP BEYOND WOMEN I THINK THERE'S

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:10.987 region:rollup2
THERE'S A GENERAL.

02:57:09.486 --> 02:57:12.655 region:rollup2
DEMAND THAT LEGISLATORS DON'T

02:57:10.987 --> 02:57:14.591 region:rollup2
MATCH THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF

02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:16.059 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY ANY STATE IN ANY IN

02:57:14.591 --> 02:57:18.661 region:rollup2
RELIGION AND IN THE RACE AND

02:57:16.059 --> 02:57:21.197 region:rollup2
GENDER. UP ACROSS THE BOARD BUT

02:57:18.661 --> 02:57:22.765 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY BEYOND ENCOURAGEMENT

02:57:21.197 --> 02:57:24.601 region:rollup2
I MEAN THE VOTERS ARE ARE WHO

02:57:22.765 --> 02:57:25.568 region:rollup2
LACKS THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE LIVE

02:57:24.601 --> 02:57:26.936 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF VERY FEW

02:57:25.568 --> 02:57:28.805 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T GET

02:57:26.936 --> 02:57:30.740 region:rollup2
SELECTED TO BE A LEGISLATOR YOU

02:57:28.805 --> 02:57:31.674 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU RUN. AND SO WHILE

THERE'S ENCOURAGEMENT THERE'S

02:57:31.674 --> 02:57:35.178 region:rollup2
ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN REALLY

02:57:33.443 --> 02:57:36.279 region:rollup2
HAPPEN ON THAT SIDE AND I THINK

02:57:35.178 --> 02:57:37.747 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY A STATE SPECIFIC I

02:57:36.279 --> 02:57:40.517 region:rollup2
MEAN THROUGH THE STATE DECIDES

02:57:37.747 --> 02:57:42.018 region:rollup2
TO CUT BACK IN THE ELECTION.

02:57:40.517 --> 02:57:43.753 region:rollup2
IF THEY BACK MORE BUT YOU KNOW

02:57:42.018 --> 02:57:45.255 region:rollup2

REPUBLICAN PARTY ASIDE SETBACK

02:57:45.255 --> 02:57:48.224 region:rollup2
THE CANDIDATES THAN. YOU SEE

02:57:46.856 --> 02:57:48.858 region:rollup2
SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY WAS LIKE

02:57:48.224 --> 02:57:54.797 region:rollup2
SO MUCH THAT THEY CAN REALLY BE

02:57:48.858 --> 02:57:55.865 region:rollup2
DONE.

02:57:54.797 --> 02:57:57.066 region:rollup2
OKAY IF THERE'S NO MORE

02:57:55.865 --> 02:57:58.568 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW I DO WANT TO

02:57:57.066 --> 02:58:01.137 region:rollup2
