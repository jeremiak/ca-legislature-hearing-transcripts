BUT A FOCUS OF THE AT THE AT THE OUTSET ON THE OVERALL BUDGET SO. THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TONY BUDGET IS -- A GOOD START IN INVESTING IN THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA. ARE -- PREMIER RESEARCH UNIVERSITY HERE WONDERING FORTY MILLION IN NEW ONGOING FUNDING FOR CORE SERVICES -- AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE TIME -- FOR YOU SEE ALLOWING US TO DEAL WITH COST INCREASES SOME BUILDING MAINTENANCE -- AS WELL SOME IMPORTANT FUNDING TO ADDRESS. STUDENT ISSUES LIKE -- HOUSING AND SECURITY -- HUNGER AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET APPROACH AND OUR STARTING OUT IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE THAT ARE ABSENT THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS ONE IS ENROLLMENT GROWTH WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A BIG DEMAND. FOR A YOU SEE EDUCATION FROM OUR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES MORE AND MORE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING. AND TAKING THEIR REQUIRED YOU SEE ELIGIBLE. SELL ONE DISAPPOINTING NO IS THERE ISN'T ANY MONEY -- FOR ANY ENROLLMENT GROWTH NOT NOT NOT ONE NEW STUDENT IN THE UC A BUDGET PROPOSAL THERE IS MONEY TO FUND PRIOR YEARS COMMITMENTS BUT NO -- A NEW ENROLLMENT SEEAND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE -- WE ADDRESS THAT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HEAR FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ON THE YEAR BUDGET PRACTICE IS A FOLLOW UP ON THE STATE AUDITOR'S ASSESSMENT AS FAR AS HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION IS GOING. AND TO MAKE SURE THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BUDGET IS ON TRACK. AND THEN -- FINALLY WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE THE UC -- PATH ISSUE SO -- WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN AND KIND OF JUMP AROUND WE'RE GONNA START WITH ISSUE NUMBER. TWO ON UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ENROLLMENT. BUT WITH THAT WE DO HAVE FOR HERE AND THAT WHEN WE TAKE ROLE MCCARTY [inaudible] BRO -- MEDINA. O'DONNELL. FORM IS ESTABLISHED. OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING JESS WALTER FROM A FINANCE -- TO BEGIN A LIKE TO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE TEN MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT ROMAN GROWTH CURRENTLY PAY FOURTH ONE TIME FUNDS PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT -- TO DISCUSS THE RATIONALE BEHIND -- THE GOVERNOR'S THE TIRE PACKAGE DEMONSTRATION SELECTED THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES OF UC'S BUDGET REQUEST ALREADY NEGOTIATED SALARY INCREASES ENSURING STUDENTS ARE FED AND HOUSED. IN PROVIDING NEEDED MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS OPENING -- TO FUNDING AROMA GROWTH WITHIN THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE SEA BUDGET THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY BRIEF. ELIO DECENT CONCENTRATES. THIS ITEM REALLY HAS TO ISSUES BEFORE YOU THE FIRST IS AS THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED -- ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THEN THE SECOND ISSUE IS A MOMENT IN TWENTY IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND AND IN FUTURE YEARS. SO I WANT TO ADDRESS EACH ISSUE ONE OF THE TIME. REGARDING THE FIRST ISSUE AND MOMENT IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS ISSUE HAS SOME HAS A LOT OF BACKSTORY THAT'S SICKLY THE STATE PROVIDED SOME ONE TIME FUNDING IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET -- FOR ADDITIONAL ROMAN GROWTH -- BEYOND WHAT WAS EXPLICITLY CALLED FOR IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. I THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THE IN PROVIDING THOSE FUNDS THIS BUDGET DIDN'T SPECIFY THOUGH THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT YOU SEE WAS TO ENROLL. AND IT DIDN'T ALSO SPECIFY HOW YOU SEE WHAT'S A CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT GROWTH AFTER. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ON COULD YOU SEE CURRENTLY ESTIMATES THAT IT IT WILL ENROLL ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED MORE STUDENTS THAN -- WAS EXPLICITLY OF A BUDGET IN THE AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TO PROVIDE TEN MILLION DOLLARS. WHICH WOULD SUPPORT A THOUSAND STUDENTS SO LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF THAT THOSE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS. AND GIVEN THE OF THE BIG ISSUES IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACHES WITH ONE REASONABLE APPROACH. APPROXIMATELY THE QUESTION REALLY RESIDES WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE REST OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED HOW MANY STUDENTS LEGISLATURE INTENDED YOU SEE THE TO SUPPORT AN ACT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENTIONS WERE WITH. PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDING AND HOW YOU SEE WOULD COVER THAT COST IN FUTURE YEARS -- WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND ISSUE ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN LATER YEARS AS IT HAS BEEN REFERENCED THE GOVERNOR ISN'T PROPOSING ISN'T SETTING -- AND ROMAN TARGET FOR YOU SEE IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND ALSO IS IN PROVIDING ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR GROWTH -- BEYOND WHAT WAS AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE SET A TARGET -- IN OUR VIEW THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY WAYS THE LEGISLATURE IS MEETING ITS EXPECTATIONS. ONE RECOMMENDATION OUR OFFICE DOES HAVE THOUGH IS THAT YOU SAID THAT TARGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE INSTEAD OF NINETEEN TWENTY IN A REASONING THERE IS A BY THE TIME YOU ENACT THE BUDGET. ARE YOU SEE WILL HAVE MADE MOST OF ITS FALL ADMISSION DECISIONS -- FOR I'D FALL TWENTY NINETEEN FACT THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF THESE DECISIONS RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. IN TERMS OF OUR WEATHER NOT THIS TARGET SHOULD. INCLUDE GROWTH OR NOT OR ARE HOW MUCH GROWTH TO PROVIDE WE DO OFFER SOME FACTORS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD A LOT OF THESE FACTORS BEFORE SO I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THEM VERY QUICKLY. ON THE ONE HAND AS AS WE'VE NOTED IN THE PAST YOU SEE IS LIKELY YOUR DRAWING FROM BEYOND ITS A FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY ABILITY PAUL. AND ADMINISTRATION PROJECTIONS OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES -- THE THE PROJECT. VERY SLIGHT DECLINES OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND SO THOSE TWO FACTORS SUGGEST THAT ENROLLMENT GROWTH. MAY NOT BE AS HIGH OF A PRIORITY ON THE OTHER HAND -- MANY STUDENTS ARE STILL REDIRECTED -- TO MERCED ARE NOT ACCOMMODATED TO THE FIRST COULD ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO ACCOMMODATE MORE STUDENTS TO THE FIRST CHOICE CAMPUS AND THAT MIGHT BE A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TERM MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SAY OF IT THEN AND I WILL BE TALKING ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TODAY ON OUR OPERATING BUDGET. I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE IN THE AUDIENCE ARE CHAIR OF THE BOARD REGION -- GEORGE KEEFER WHO WILL BE OBSERVING TODAY -- SINCE WE HAVE SOME NEW MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I LAST PRESENTED TO YOU I'M GOING TO VERY BRIFLY GO OVER SOME VERY HIGH LEVEL BASICS AND THE SERGEANT HAS DISTRIBUTED TO HAND OUT TO YOU. THAT HAS THIS -- COLORFUL FRONT HERE -- ON SLIDE. TO ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU WILL SEE A DONUT SHAPE PIE CHART THAT IN CONTAINS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OPERATING BUDGET -- FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE TOTAL YOU SEE BUDGET IS ESTIMATED AT THIRTY SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE MEDICAL CENTERS MAKE UP ROUGHLY ONE THIRD OF THIS. AND THE COMPONENT IN THE ORANGE THERE ARE THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IS OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND GRANTS. FOR BILLION OF THAT IS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE GRANTS THAT UC FACULTY BRING INTO THE STATE -- THAT THEN GETS DISTRIBUTED -- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY -- IN THE YELLOW YOU WILL SEE OUR SALES AND SERVICES THOSE ARE THE AUXILIARIES TO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE OUR DORMITORIES. THE FOOD SERVICES THE PARKING ARE CONSIDERED -- SELF CONTAINED THE THE PAY FOR THEMSELVES AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE PAGE WE HAVE THE UC'S CORE FUNDS BUDGET THIS IS ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF OUR TOTAL OPERATING BUDGET. BUT THIS IS THE COMPONENT OF THE BUDGET THAT PAYS FOR THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS AN INSTRUCTION THAT WILL BE FOCUSING ON IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. THE TOTAL UC CORE FUNDS BUDGET IS ABOUT NINE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND ALL OF THAT APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION GOES TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BUDGET LATER ON IN THIS PRESENTATION. SEPARATELY -- FROM THE CORE FUNDS. THE STATE PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY -- ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. FOR FOR UNIVERSITY OPERATIONS AND STUDENT FEES -- THAT BEING TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES FEE PROVIDE ANOTHER THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. FROM OUR NON RESIDENTS SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION PAID BY OUR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS TO UNIVERSITY IS NOW GETTING. ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. SO IT IS HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR THE UNIVERSITY I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT OUT OF OUR CORE FUNDS WE HAVE CERTAIN EXPENDITURES COME OUT THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER. THAT WE CANNOT RE DIRECT FOR OTHER PURPOSES THESE INCLUDE OUR GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS -- THEY ALSO INCLUDE PAYMENTS FIRST YOU HAVE CALIFORNIA RETIREMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A SELF CONTAINED RETIREMENT PROGRAM FOR YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. AND IT ALSO WE INCLUDE OUR STUDENT FINANCIAL AID AND THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. THOSE THREE COMPONENTS TOGETHER AMOUNT TO ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THAT NINE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR FIGURE WHEN WE DISCUSS HOW MUCH IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONS. NOW I'D LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO SLIDE. THREE THE REGION'S RECENTLY TOOK ACTION. ON A MULTI YEAR PLAN -- DO ESTABLISH A BROAD FRAMEWORK OF A VISION FOR THE UNIVERSITY UNTIL. TWENTY THIRTY THE EMPHASIS OF THIS VISION IS TO MOVE AWAY FROM A YEAR TO YEAR ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT TO WORK AN OUTCOMES BASED APPROACH PARTY UNIVERSITY. AT THE HEART OF THIS VISION IS A DEEP COMMITMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA DREAM AND ENSURING THAT. YOU SEE BOTH MAINTAINS ACCESS AND PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO SUCCEED FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. THIS VERSION INCLUDES AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FACULTY WHO MENTOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF THOUGHT LEADERS AND GENERATE. ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR CALIFORNIA THROUGH THEIR INVENTIONS AND GRANTS THAT THEY BRING INTO THE STATE. AND OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THE REGION'S MULTI YEAR PLAN WILL INCREASE ENROLLMENT MODESTLY -- PRIMARILY FOCUS ON CLOSING GRADUATION GAPS SHORTENING TIME TO DEGREE AND BRINGING THOSE WHO LEFT WITHOUT A DEGREE BACK FOR COMPLETION. ON THE NEXT SLIDE I WANTED TO BRIEFLY SHOW. WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TEN BUDGET INTRODUCTION PROVIDED THAT THE UNIVERSITY? AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. OF THIS ABOUT TWO OF OF THIS AMOUNT TO HER I'M GOING FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY. AND THIS WAS DIVIDED INTO THE CATEGORIES YOU SEE LIST THAT THERE ON THE PAGE BY BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF PERMANENTLY ON DOES TO SO CALLED PROP FIFTY SIX SWAP. THAT WILL ALLOW YOU SEE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS STATE WIDE AS GRANTS OF FOR MEDICAL RESIDENTS. ON SLIDE -- FIVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDED. THE UNIVERSITY SOMEONE TIME FUNDS. A TOTAL OF HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION THIS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THESE ITEMS WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THE IN THE AGENDA SOLVE NOT DWELL ON THEM RIGHT NOW. ON SLIDE SIX I GO INTO. THE UNIVERSITIES -- BUDGET REQUEST IN ADDITION TO WHAT WAS IN YOUR GIRLS THE PAGE NUMBERS -- TO YES LIKE SIX IS WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW THE PAYCHECKS PAGE -- SIX THAT GOES INTO THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET REQUEST IN ADDITION TO WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JAN TEN BUDGET. I BROKEN DOWN THIS REQUEST IN THE THREE PRIMARY CATEGORIES THE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE RECEIVED A ONE TIME IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THAT GOES AWAY ON JUNE THIRTIETH IF WE'RE REQUESTING BE MADE PERMANENT. BECAUSE THIS WAS FUNDING IN LIEU OF A TWO IT'S FUNDING TO SUPPORT STUDENTS. THERE'S ANOTHER SEVENTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION TO GROW ACCESS AND SUPPORT STUDENTS AND THIS IS PRIMARILY WHERE ARE ENROLLMENT FOR QUEST RECITES AND I'LL GO INTO THAT VERY SHORTLY. CAPITAL OUTLAY DEBT SERVICE THAT ALSO WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER ON IN THIS AGENDA. SLIDE. SEVEN INCLUDES THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF OUR ENROLLMENT FOR QUEST. THE UNIVERSITY IS REQUESTING FORTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR NEW ENROLLMENT GROWTH THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS INCLUDES TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES AND ONE THOUSAND NEW CALIPH NEW GRADUATE STUDENTS. THIS IS AT THE NEW MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION. IN ADDITION TO THIS NEW ENROLLMENT GROWTH REQUEST UNIVERSITIES REQUESTING FUNDING FOR EXISTING ENROLLMENT WHICH WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION. FOR THESE CURRENTLY ENROLLED STUDENTS INCLUDED AND ROLL OVER AND ROMAN IN THE FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN CLASS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STUDENTS BY NEARLY NINETEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. ON TOP WITH THE TWO THOUSAND FOR WHICH FUNDING WAS -- PROVIDED. OR BUT FUNDING WAS IDENTIFIED FOR THOSE STUDENTS. ALSO THE PRIME GRADUATE MEDICAL PROGRAM WHICH IS A SPECIAL COMPONENT OF MOST UC MEDICAL SCHOOLS WHERE STUDENTS PLEDGE TO WORK AS PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS. THAT PROGRAM CURRENTLY HAS TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX STUDENTS FOR WHICH WE KNOW MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION IT'S BEING RECEIVED. AND WE'RE REQUESTING THAT THOSE STUDENTS BE FULLY STUDENT MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION WHICH IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PER STUDENT. NOT SHOWN ON THE SLIDE IS A TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. OF FOR WHOM YOU SEE RECEIVED ONE TIME -- MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION FUNDS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THOSE ARE AND THE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST -- ON SLIDE EIGHT THE NEXT PAGE -- PROVIDES THIS CHART SHOWING HOW RAPIDLY UC'S RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE GROWN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE HAVE LET IN A LARGE NUMBER OF RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES. AND THIS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY GOOD FOR OUR STUDENTS. BUT IT ALSO RESULTS IN SOME FINANCIAL NEEDS WERE THE UNIVERSITY DO STUDENTS NEED TO BE FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED -- THEY NEED ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC COUNSELORS AND OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED. ADDITIONAL COURSES SO WE HAVE TO HIRE DE UM INSTRUCTORS FOR THEM. ON SLIDE. NINE I GO INTO THE UNFUNDED ENROLLMENT FOR THE UNIVERSITY AND THIS HAS -- THIS ISSUE IS BECOMING QUITE SERIOUS FOR US AT THIS POINT -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU WILL SEE BY. THE ACADEMIC YEAR AND THE TOTAL CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES LISTED NEXT TO IT -- THE NEXT COLUMN SHOWS THE GROWTH OR DECLINE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR HOW THOSE NUMBER TOTAL NUMBER OF RESIDENTS HAS FLUCTUATED IN THE UNIVERSITY. THE BUDGET ACT MANDATED GROWTH WAS THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING WE RECEIVED A NUMBER STUDENTS WE RECEIVED FUNDING. FOR IN THE BUDGET ACT THAT WAS IDENTIFIED NOW. I HAVE NOT DONE ANY SUBTRACTIONS FOR PARTIAL MARGINAL COST OR FOR YOU SEE -- P. FUNDING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS THAT WE WERE IDENTIFIED TOGETHER IN OUR DISCUSSIONS IS BEING FUNDED. SO THE LAST COLUMN THERE IS THE UNFUNDED F. T. A GROWTH AND WE ARE NOW IT'S OVER FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS SYSTEM WIDE. FOR WHOM WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION FUNDING FROM THE STATE. THIS IS GRADING SEVERE PROBLEMS ON OUR CAMPUSES. WHERE BEHIND AND FACULTY HIRING? UP WE ARE MORE LECTURES RATHER THAN A LADDER RANK FACULTY -- STUDENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO ALWAYS GET INTO THE COURSES THEY NEED WE HAVE INCREASING PROBLEMS WITH BOTTLENECK COURSES. WE'RE BEHIND ON HIRING AT ACADEMIC ADVISORS. TO HELP THE STUDENTS GREAT THERE -- STEM PROGRAMS OF STUDY SO THAT THEY CAN GET THROUGH AND IN A TIMELY FASHION. OF THESE STUDENTS TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WERE FUNDED ONE TIME IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND WE ARE VERY MUCH REQUESTING THAT THOSE FUNDS BE MADE PERMANENT. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE THOSE STUDENTS WITH THE EDUCATION THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED. ON SLIDE -- TEN I GO INTO A LITTLE BIT WHO ARE THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADMITTED RECENTLY -- WE HAVE. OVER THE EIGHT THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS SEEN ARE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE IN THE MIX F OUR STUDENTS -- ETHNICITY WISE -- THE STUDENTS WHO ARE LATINO AND LATINA ARE THE FASTEST GROWING UNDERGRADUATE -- GROUP WITH IN THE UC SYSTEM -- IN FACT THREE OF OUR NOW CAMPUS OF THREE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES ARE NOW LISTED AS HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS. THOSE ARE UC IRVINE UC RIVERSIDE AND UC MERCED -- UC'S FACULTY HIRING -- IS ALSO IMPROVING BUT MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE -- WE ARE HEAD OF OUR OTHER AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITIES INSTITUTIONS BOTH A A YOU IN UNIVERSITIES -- WE ARE AT 10% OF U. R. M. FACULTY AND THAT'S UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY WELL AS OTHER PUBLIC SORRY 8% -- BUT STILL MORE MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ALSO SEE OUR HIRING OF AFRICAN AMERICAN FACULTY HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND ARE HIRING FOR HISPANIC AND LATINO LATINA FACULTY HAS INCREASED BY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. BUT MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE AND FOR THE LAST PAST THREE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED YOU SEE WITH TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN ONE TIME FUNDS FOR FACULTY DIVERSITY EFFORTS. AND THESE FUNDS HELPED TREMENDOUSLY WE HAD PILOT PROGRAMS ON EIGHT OF OUR CAMPUSES AND WE LEARNED A LOT OF VALUABLE LESSONS. IN HOW TO ATTRACT MORE DIVERSE. POOL OF CANDIDATES SO THAT WE HAD EXTREMELY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES WHO OFFERED TREMENDOUS AMOUNT THAT THE UNIVERSITY. OF SOME OF THESE LESSONS WERE REQUIRING FACULTY DIVERSITY STATEMENTS FROM THE CANDIDATES -- REQUESTING THEM FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THEY WOULD HELP THE DIVERSE ENVIRONMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY -- AND ALSO A DIFFERENT RECRUITMENT PRACTICES AND WHERE TO ADVERTISE AND SO FORTH THOSE ALL HELPED. SO THAT'S A BRIEF LOOK AT WHO OUR STUDENTS ARE AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT OUR UNIVERSITY'S FACULTY REFLECTS OUR STUDENT BODY. ON PAGE ELEVEN WE HAVE OUR UNDERGRADUATE NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT GROWTH. WHICH YOU HAVE YOU WILL SEE HAS BEEN GROWING -- AFTER STATE FUNDING WAS BROUGH BACK -- IN FUNDING ARE NON RESIDENT NUMBERS ALSO GREW -- YOU WILL SEE THE NON RESIDENTS REPRESENTED BY TWO YELLOW BAR HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE LAST DECADE. ARE NON RESIDENT ROMAN HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF CORE FUND REVENUES FOR TO UNIVERSITY YOU WILL RECALL IN THE EARLIER PAGE WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT THE TOTAL COR FUNDS OF THE UNIVERSITY. THAT NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION IS NOW AT ONE POINT EIGHT WHAT SORRY. MY APOLOGIES ONE POINT THREE BILLION. ANNUALLY. IN REVENUES FOR THE UNIVERSITY -- THE REGION'S ON MARCH FOURTEENTH DECIDED TO DELAY A VOTE TO INCREASE NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION BY TWO POINT 6%. AND THAT INCREASE WOULD HAVE YIELDED -- ABOUT TWENTY NINE MILLION IN NEW REVENUE FOR THE UNIVERSITY BUT IT'S STILL BEING DEBATED. ON THE NEXT SLIDE -- I WANTED TO SHOW YOU HOW OUR CORE FANS HAVE SHOWN OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS. ON THE FAR LEFT YOU'LL SEE THAT INFLATION ADJUSTED DOLLARS THE UNIVERSITY HAS GROWN IT'S FUNDING BY ABOUT 8% SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SIR TOTAL FUNDING DOLLAR WISE HAS BEEN GOING UP -- INCLUDED IN THAT AMOUNT IS ARE NON RESIDENT -- SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION -- AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PARTNER IN INCREASING THIS AMOUNT OF FUNDING. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS YOU VOTED EACH YEAR TO PROVIDE TO UNIVERSITY WITH MORE RESOURCES -- FOR OUR CORE MISSION AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. IN THE MIDDLE CHARGE YOU WILL SEE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT OUR ENROLLMENT HAS SKYROCKETED BY ABOUT 59% SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES. THAT NUMBER INCLUDES NON RESIDENTS AS DOES THE CORE FUNDS BAR ON THE FAR LEFT INCLUDE THE NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION. ONCE THIS DRAMATIC GROWTH IN STUDENT SUCCESS ACCESS IS ACCOUNTED FOR THE DOLLARS PER STUDENT AVAILABLE TO THE CAMPUSES FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON OPERATIONS. THE SO CALLED CORE FUNDS PURSED DECREASED BY 32% SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIS IS. OF FORCING OUR CAMPUSES TO WORK SMARTER AND HARDER WHICH THEY CERTAINLY HAVE DONE WE HAVE MULTIPLE INITIATIVES TO SAVE FUNDING -- FROM PROCUREMENT TO ENERGY TO OUR OF SELF INSURANCE PROGRAM UP AND ELIMINATING -- TUITION FINANCIAL AID FOR NON RESIDENTS -- BUT CAMPUSES ARE STILL STRUGGLING. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THE SONS PAGE THIRTEEN YOU'LL SEE THE STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO AT UC HAS CAUGHT BEEN THE CLIMBING? SO WE HAVE FEWER LETTERING FACULTY AND FEWER LECTURES EVEN -- FIRST FOUR PER STUDENT STAND OUR PUBLIC COMPARISON INSTITUTIONS. WHAT THIS DOES IT HAS -- OVERALL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON QUALITY. THE MOST IMMEDIATE TANGIBLE IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS HAS BEEN THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME A LOT AROUND FACULTY HAVE AVAILABLE TO MENTOR AND PROVIDE INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION TO STUDENTS. BOTH GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE HAS DECREASED -- AN ON SLIDE FOURTEEN YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THE IMPACTS AS REPORTED BY THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES EVERY TWO YEARS WE DO AN UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE SURVEY OF OUR STUDENTS. AND WE'VE BEEN NOTING SOME TROUBLING TRENDS. ON THE LEFT YOU'LL SEE A BAR CHART OF STUDENT RESPONSES ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD STILL AND ROLL LIKE YOU SEE AFTER TO EXPERIENCE -- THEIR EXPERIENCE AT THE CAMPUS. WE HAVE SEEN A DROP FROM 33% OF STUDENTS STRONGLY AGREEING THAT THEY WOULD STILL AND ROLL TO NOW OF AGREEING THAT'S BEEN IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT WE'VE SEEN THE STROP -- WHAT'S BEHIND THESE NUMBERS ARE THE EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES THAT STUDENTS HAVE OF OVERCROWDED CLASSROOMS WAIT TIMES TO SPEAK TO AN ADVISOR AND BUILDING CONDITIONS OF MAINTENANCE FUNDS HAVE BEEN CUT BACK. ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PAGE YOU'LL SEE EVEN MORE TROUBLING TRENDS. I'M BACK IN 200063% OF STUDENTS RESPONDED NOT BEING ABLE TO GET INTO THE MAJOR OFF THEIR FIRST CHOICE. TEN YEARS LATER IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS NUMBER HAD INCREASED 213% OF STUDENTS NOT GETTING INTO THEIR FIRST MAJOR. WHEN STUDENTS CAN STUDY THE SUBJECT THAT THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THERE'S A LOSS OF PERSONAL POTENTIAL AND OF FRUSTRATION AT A SITUATION THAT COULD BE BUT A COULD BE FIXED BY HIRING MORE FROM? INSTRUCTORS. OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ARE ALSO FEELING LESS CONNECTED TO THEIR FACULTY WITH A 14% DROP OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IN STUDENTS WHO FEEL THEY KNOW THEIR FACULTY MEMBER MEMBER WELL ENOUGH TO ASK FOR A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION. AT THE START OF THEIR UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES 39% OF YOU SEE STUDENTS EXPRESS AN INTENT TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. THOSE WHO COMPLETE GRADUATE SCHOOL AND EARNINGS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MONEY THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS THAN THOSE WHO. TO HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. BUT WHEN STUDENTS CAN'T GET A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION THOSE PLANS TO ATTEND GRADUATE SCHOOL MAY BE PUT ON HOLD. AS MIGHT BE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION. SUCH A STUDY ABROAD IN APPLYING FOR EXTERNAL SCHOLARSHIPS. AND THE FINAL SLIDE ON THE ENROLLMENT SORRY THIS IS MY LONGEST PRESENTATION AND TEN TIRE. AGAIN THIS IS JUST THE ENROLLMENT ITEM THIS IS A JUST A GENERAL MIDNIGHT ON THE GENOCIDE -- SO WHAT OUR PLANS OUR PLANS ARE TO HIRE EXCELLENT FACULTY. THE REGION'S AS PART OF THEIR MULTI YEAR PLAN. HAVE DEVELOPED A FOR YOUR HIRING PLAN FOR BLATTER RANG FACULTY ON TOP OF THE FACULTY NEEDED TO SIMPLY REPLACE THOSE WHO ARE LEAVING ON RETIRING. WE WANT TO USE THE ENROLLMENT FUNDING THAT I DISCUSSED EARLIER THAT SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WE WANT TO USE IT TO HIRE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN NEW FACULTY FAR UC CAMPUSES. IN ORDER TO TEACH COURSES AND MENTOR GRADUATE STUDENTS MENTOR UNDERGRADUATES AND BRING IN ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION ON ENROLLMENT. THANK YOU SIR OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS ON THE ENROLLMENT -- AS GENDER ITEM. ALL OF A FEW BUT WHICH TO MAKE IT MAKE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER LAMONT THANK YOU. THERE IS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ROLE THAT FACULTY PLAYS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS IF. YOU KNOW THAT THE THE HOW THE ACADEMIC SENATE OVERALL FOR THE SYSTEM IS RESPONDING TO SOME. OF THE AND THE NOT SO GREAT BENEFITS OF THE CHANGES IN FUNDING -- AND SPECIFICALLY WHEN THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO MENTOR WHEN THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO KIND OF CULTIVATE THE NEXT RESEARCHERS THE NEXT -- GRADUATE STUDENTS PER SE I KNOW THAT WHEN I MEAN THAT SOME OF THE WORK THAT I DID WHEN I WORKED AT THE UC AND THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR FACULTY SO I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW THEIR AT THE PRACTICALITY OF HOW THEY'RE RESPONDING TO THIS. I MEAN WHAT ARE FACTORED I I'M SURE THEY'RE NOT HAPPY BUT WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO DO -- GIVEN HOW. I MEAN THEY'RE LIMITED RESOURCES -- FACULTY NEED TIME TO MENTOR THEIR GRADUATE STUDENTS THE PHD STUDENTS AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR ATTENTION -- TO WHICH IS WHY WE SEE THE DROP IN UNDERGRADUATES HAVING. ACCESS TO SOME OF THE FACULTY IT'S A STE -- WHEN THE FACULTY DON'T HAVE ANY TIME AND WHEN THEY HAVE TOO MANY STUDENTS I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REAL IMPACTS OF IT -- THE FACULTY ARE ALSO FORCED TO SEEK MORE OF THEIR OWN GRANTS BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY CAN'T HELP THEM WITH -- THE BASICS FOR RUNNING THEIR LABS OR THE FUNDING FOR THEIR GRADUATE STUDENT FACULTY ARE HAVING TO PAY FOR THOSE GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH ASSISTANTS FROM. THEIR OWN GRANTS THEIR SALARY AND THE FEE REMISSION FOR THOSE GRADUATE STUDENTS COMES OUT OF THE FACULTIES. GRANTS SO THAT THERE'S MORE PRESSURE ON THE FACULTY -- TO APPLY FOR GRANTS SOME OF THE CAMPUSES ACTUALLY I THINK ALL OF THEM -- AS STATE BEEN EXPERIENCING COST PRESSURES HAVE TRIED -- TO POOL STAFF BETWEEN MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS SO DEPARTMENTS NO LONGER HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL STAFF BUT THEY WILL FOR EXAMPLE HIGHER ONE INDIVIDUAL FOR A MULTITUDE OF DEPARTMENTS WHO HELPS THE FACULTY. WITH ADDED IN THERE GRANT PROPOSALS AND MANAGING THEM FINANCES A COMMON FOR THOSE GRANTS SO INSTEAD OF BACK IN THE DISTANT PAST THEY USED TO HAVE -- AND A LARGE APARTMENT WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN PERSON TO HELP THE FACULTY WITHOUT NOW THEY SHARE THOSE PEOPLE ACROSS DEPARTMENTS IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD A FULL LEFTY ANYMORE. THANK YOU I THINK THAT THOSE ARE SOME REAL CONCERNS I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES ANY UNIVERSITIES REPUTATION -- SKYROCKET OR NOT IS THE LEVEL OF RESEARCH AND FACULTY THERE I MEAN THAT'S HOW IT'S DRIVEN AND IT'S A TRICKLE EFFECT BECAUSE THERE ARE FACULTY WHO ARE SEEKING POSITIONS BASED ON AT THEIR ABILITY TO WORK WITH GRADUATE STUDENTS AND UNDERGRADS AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THEIR RESEARCH FOR THEIR LAB. FOR THEIR POTENTIAL TO APPLY TO GROW. AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT I THINK IT'S SOMETIMES EASY TO REMOVE THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE FROM THE FACULTY EXPERIENCE BUT AT LEAST -- FROM THE WORK THAT I DID AT THE UC IT'S I MEAN THERE THERE REALLY TANGIBLE. THEY GO HAND IN HAND -- AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE A WORLD WHERE. AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES ARE SO MUCH MORE. COMPETITIVE WITH US THAT WE START TO LOSE -- THE ABILITY TO TRACK THE BEST FACULTY WHICH ATTRACTS THE BEST STUDENTS WHICH ATTRACTS I THINK YOU KNOW INVESTMENTS -- BOTH FROM OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY AND OUR INVESTMENTS I I JUST WANT TO CAUTION US ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED VERY DIRECTLY WITH STUDENTS AND FACULTIES AND BUILDING THAT RESEARCH BRIDGE -- I FOUND IT PARTICULARLY HELPFUL -- NOT JUST FOR THE FACULTY MEMBER OR THE INSTITUTION BUT THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES IT OPENED UP PROFESSIONAL CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE THAT INTERACTION. WITH FACULTY. MAYBE TO FOLLOW UP ON MISLI MON ON THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE I I FIND -- SLIDE FOURTEEN VERY TROUBLING -- AS THE THE DECLINE IN SATISFACTION FROM 200-062-2000 -- SIXTEEN PARTICULARLY THE THE THE SECOND WHEN THEY'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO TO OF MAJOR IN THEIR FIRST CHOICE OF MAJOR. 13% -- YOU KNOW I IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT PEOPLE OF BEGIN COLLEGE WITH AN IDEA THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO STUDY THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO GET THEIR DEGREE AND AND TO HAVE THAT HIGH OF A PERCENTAGE. OF STUDENTS NOT BEING ABLE -- TO GET THE MAJOR THAT THEY WANT. IS IS A VERY TROUBLING I UNDERSTAND. THAT IS TIED TO FUNDING SO. NOW I HAVE TO GO TO A DIFFERENT MAJOR -- GET ON THEY GO FROM WHAT. IT -- BIOLOGY. TO SOMETHING OUTSIDE IN A ANY ANY ANY INPUT THAT YOU CAN GIVE US. WE WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T HAVE DATE ON WHICH MAJOR SONS ACTUALLY DO END UP SELECTING WE WOULD THINK OF PROBABLY WOULD BE A MAJOR RELATIVELY CLOSE TO WHAT. I WANT TO AND ORIGINALLY STUDY -- BUT IT'S CERTAINLY LEADS TO PERSONAL FRUSTRATION THEY COME TO THE UNIVERSITY THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE. SOMETHING THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONAL ASPIRATIONS AND THEN THEY GOT TOLD THERE'S NO ROOM FOR YOU AND WITHIN THIS MAJOR -- AND PERHAPS THEY MOVE FROM -- CHEMISTRY. TO PHYSICS OR BIOLOGY OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW I'VE I'M NOT CERTAIN WHAT THE COMPARABLE MAJOR WOULD BE IT WOULD BE AN ACADEMIC ADVISER WHO WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF HELPING THE STUDENTS IDENTIFIER DIFFERENT MAJOR. HOWEVER WE'RE SHORT ON ACADEMIC ADVISORS AND THE WAIT LIST IS VERY LONG SO SOME OF THE ACTUAL IMPACTS FOR THE STUDENT MAY BE THAT THEY TRY TO END UP. TAKING COURSES THAT THEY TEND DON'T NEED FOR THE MAJOR WHERE THEY ACTUALLY END UP THEY END UP TAKING MORE UNITS THAN THEY NEED TO STAND UP STAYING LONGER WITH THE UNIVERSITY. AND AS A RESULT THEY MAY BE TAKING ON MORE PERSONAL DEBT YEAH WELL. CERTAINLY -- AS AS MISLI MON SAID YOU KNOW THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE I THINK IS PARAMOUNT. AND WHEN WE'RE SEEING -- DECLINE IN IN SATISFACTION IT'S IT'S IS VERY TROUBLING. SOMEONE NUMBER O'DONNELL. YES JUST A QUESTION ABOUT A TUITION OR FEES WHATEVER WE LABEL IT. IN STATE IS ABOUT TWELVE PER YEAR IF I'M CORRECT -- YES -- ELEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS OUT OF STATE IS ABOUT. FORTY ONE THAT'S CORRECT M. WHAT A STUDENT PAY THAT ALL FOUR YEARS COULD THEY GET REIDENCY AFTER THE FIRST YEAR NO UNDERGRADUATES CANNOT GET RESIDENCY AT ALL OKAY. AND THEN WHAT ABOUT INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TO THEY PAY OUT OF STATERS ARE DIFFERENT INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS PAY OUT OF STATE TUITION. THERE'S NO INTERNATIONAL. THERE IS NO EXTRA INTERNATIONAL FEED THE WE DO CHARGE FEES FOR ANY VISA PROCESSING. THAT OCCUR HAD THAT THE CAMPUS MAY HAVE TO DO AND WE STE SOME CAMPUSES CHARGE SOME. FEES NOW THAT AFTER -- AFTER NINE ELEVEN THERE WERE SOME LAWS PUT IN PLACE THAT WE HAVE TO TRACK THAT THE STUDENT IS ACTUALLY ENROLLED. AND THE WE HAVE SOME THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO CHECK STUDENT FOR SO WE CHARGE A FEE FOR THAT. DO YOU DO YOU KNOW -- I SEE THE THE OUT OF STATE THE THE FIGURES ASSOCIATE WITH OUT OF STATE. WHAT WHAT'S DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ARE OUT OF STATE VERSUS OUT OF COUNTRY -- LET'S SEE I HAVE JUST OUR MOST RECENT FRESHMAN CLASS -- IT'S UP ABOUT ONE THIRD DOMESTIC TWO THIRDS INTERNATIONAL FOOD YOU OTHER UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES CHARGING INTERNATIONAL FEE AS OPPOSED TO AN OUT OF STATE FEE. THE EARLY IF THEY CHARGE I'M NOT CERTAIN I THINK I BELIEVE MOST OF THEM CHARGE THIS I'M NOT ON HOLD TO THAT WE CAN FIND THAT OUT LATER YEAH I GOT MIGHT GET SO THAT AIM TO EXPLORE. OR AT LEAST IF THE QUESTION I I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION -- AND THEN I'M I'M LOOKING AT SLIDE -- FOURTEEN SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN STUDENTS STRONGLY AGREE THAT THEY WOULD AND ROLL AGAIN -- ONE MORE STUDENTS CANNOT GET THEIR MAJOR TWO STUDENTS ARE LESS CONNECTED WITH THE FACULTY SO WHAT WHAT IS THE UNIVERSITY. DOING ABOUT THAT. WE ARE REQUEST YOU CAN GET HAVE INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THIS THIS DATA. OF WE'RE REQUESTING THAT YOU PROVIDE US WITH SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IT CAN'T COME HERE AND SAY IT'S IT'S YOUR PROBLEM IT'S OUR PROBLEM AND THE ANSWER CAN'T ONLY BE DOLLARS THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER THINGS. GOING ON IN THE UNIVERSITY TO IT. THAT THAT THAT CREATES THIS DYNAMIC. YOU HAVE INITIATIVE TO ADDRESS THIS DATA OR NO. YOU KNOW. WE ARE LOOKING AT STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES WHICH ARE CREATING -- A MORE TIME FOR STUDENTS WITH PIERRE COHORTS FOR EXAMPLE -- SO STUDENTS WOULD COME IN AND TAKE A CERTAIN SET OF COURSES ON THEIR FIRST YEAR WITH THEIR PEERS SO THAT THEY DEVELOP STRONG BONDS WITH OTHER STUDENTS -- SO THAT THEY CAN DO PEER TO PEER MENTORING AND FEEL MORE CONNECTED TO THE UNIVERSITY AS A WHOLE -- WE ARE LOOKING AT HIRING NEW ADVISERS BUT FRANKLY SIR A LOT OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO COST A LOT OF MONEY I GET THAT AND AND I MONEY MIGHT BE PART OF THE ANSWER BUT IT CAN'T BE. THE ONLY ANSWER SO I WOULD SUGGEST THE UNIVERSITY TAKE A LOOK WITHIN ITSELF AS WELL. AND NOT JUST COME TO US AND SAY WITH ANSWERS MORE MONEY MORE MONEY THAT MIGHT BE PART OF THE ANSWER I CAN SEE THAT OUT OF THE GATE. HOWEVER I AYE THIS DATA IS TELLING YOU SOMETHING AND I THINK YOU ARE LOOK AT YOURSELVES AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I COULDN'T JUST SAY HEY. WELL I HAD MORE MONEY I COULD I COULD I COULD FIX THESE PROBLEMS WE HAD TO TO REBOOT. HOW WE OPERATE A REBOOT HOW WE ADDRESSED OUR MISSION WITHOUT MORE DOLLARS OFTEN OFTEN IN TIMES OF DECLINING DOLLARS? SO I WOULD JUST HOPE YOU THE UNIVERSITY WOULD TAKE THAT BACK AND CONTEMPLATE THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR [inaudible] OKAY. OUR FEW QUESTIONS HERE I WON I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT ON THE ACT WE CAN MAKE THIS POINT EVERY EVERY YEAR OF US WHEN THE CLARIFY THAT. ON THE STATE FUNDING OVERALL SURE CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT STEPPING UP TO FIND HIGHER ADD LIKE THE ONE WE SHOULD BE. OR TO LIKE WE DID -- DECADES BEFORE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION. OF THAT TUITION REVENUE -- I BELIEVE OVER A BILLION A STATE MONEY THROUGH THE CALTRANS AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. SO THAT IS MONEY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- I WANTED -- TO JUST MENTION. JUST -- MAYBE ASK YOU OR REGION PRESIDENT KEY FOR BEHIND YOU. ON THE NON RESIDENT TUITION INCREASE AS MR DONALD SAID IT'S NON RESIDENT REGARDLESS OF OF IF YOU'RE INTERNATIONAL OR AT YOU KNOW WEALTHY OUT OF STATERS -- I WENT TO THERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT CAME UP WITH THE REDUCE MEETING WITH US A LITTLE CONCERNING AND THAT'S THE THE STUDENTS THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED THAT. AB FIVE FORTY KIDS WHO SOMEHOW. ARE JUST MISSING OUT SO I'M NOT SURE IF WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THIS NOW BUT WE WE ARE INTERESTED IF IF THE UC WANTS. TO TALK WORK WITH US AND AND IF NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARIFICATION THOSE KIDS WHO ARE SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS AREN'T BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY WAS IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE POLICY -- SIR WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WE DO HAVE -- SOME FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. FOR OF AT THE A LOAN PROGRAM FOR THOSE WHO DON'T QUALIFY THE FOR FOR THE AB FIVE FORTY WAIVER AND WE'D BE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO TRY AND FIND SOLUTIONS. YOUR CORRECT THERE'S A GROUP OF STUDENTS WERE SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS. OF THE DOCK A PROGRAM ADDRESSES ONLY THOSE STUDENTS WHO CAME HERE BEFORE THE AGE OF TWELVE AND THE AB FIVE FORTY PROGRAM COVERS ONLY THOSE WHO CRAFTED AT LEAST THREE YEARS OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL. SO THERE'S A VERY SMALL BAND OF STUDENTS WHO CAME HERE AFTER -- TWELVE BUT THE OR WHO CAME HERE AFTER THEY WERE OVER TWELVE YEARS OLD AND DID NOT COMPLETE THREE YEARS A CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL. SO IF THEY COMPLETED THEIR JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THAT AB FIVE FORTY WAIVER YEAH WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THAT JUST WANT TO KNOW ONE THAT THE NUMBER. AND THE FOLLOW UP WITH IT WITH OUR STAFF. AND THEN TO WHAT POLICIES WE NEED TO ADDRESS BECAUSE CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT THE THE THE POPULATION WHERE WE'RE LOOKING -- TO CUT OUT WITH THE NON READ NON RESIDENT -- TUITION INCREASES -- ARE SOMETHING THAT THE REGION'S SHOULD CONSIDER -- I JUST I WANNA READ THE QUOTE FROM. THE PUBLICADO WHEN SHE TOLD THE REGION SAID THAT THIRTY MILLION. THAT WAS ON THE TABLE WOULD GO FOR AND ROLLING MORE. CALIFORNIA KIDS -- INCREASED FINANCIAL AID HIRE MORE FACULTY AND STAFF AND TEACHING ASSISTANTS SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT. ONE ARE OUR PRIORITIES THAT WE JUST SPENT. YOUR SLIDESHOW TALKING ABOUT SO. IF THIS DOESN'T GO THROUGH. YOU KNOW WHERE IS A THIRTY MILLION COME FROM I KNOW THAT THE SOME OF THE REGION SAID THEY WANT TO COME AND ASK FOR MORE MONEY FROM THE LEGISLATURE WILL TWO THINGS. ONE THE MAY REVISED MAY NOT BE AS ROSY WAS A THIS BUDGET PUT EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE AS FAR THE JACK THE JANUARY BUDGET SO WE'RE NOT CERTAIN IF IT'S GOING TO BE EXTRA MONEY IN MAY PLUS THE ECONOMY ISN'T. LIKE IT WAS LAST COUPLE YEARS THAT BEING SAID IF THERE IS ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY OUR PRIORITY IS TO FOCUS ON ENROLLMENT GROWTH AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT YOU SEE. ASKING FOR FORTY MILLION TO FUND THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND SO YOU KNOW THIS THIRTY MILLION I WOULD LEAVE A HOLE. FOR OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO TO CALIFORNIA SO. I WANT TO KNOW THAT -- AND THEN I I ALSO WANT TO ASK AS FAR AS THE THE UC'S PROJECTIONS FOR OVERALL IN ENROLLMENT SO. YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN TRYING REALLY HARD LAST YEAR'S AND YOU SEE HAS STEPPED UP AND IN ROLLED ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND NEW CALIFORNIANS IN THE LAST ROUGHLY FIVE YEARS -- MAINLY WITH CALIFORNIA MONEY IN THE BUDGET BUT THE UC HAS OVER AND ROLLED. HIS AND OF THE ENROLLMENTS NOT NECESSARILY AT AT SCIENCE BUT AND ART AT THIS THAT'S IT WOULD YOU SAY -- HERE AND THERE. BUT ON THE CHARTS. THAT ON THE ARCH AGENDA ITEM PAGE PAGE EIGHT FINE ART. NOT NOT YOUR CHART OUR AGENDA AND YEAH. THE GOAL IS TO GROW BY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR. THAT'S A WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH. THE PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN TING AND I AND AND OTHERS AND THE FOR THE FOUR YEAR GROWTH YOU HAVE HERE. IS IS. THREE THOUSAND TOTAL OVER FOUR YEARS SO. HOW DOES THAT? MATCH UPPER MORE POORLY IT DOESN'T MATCH UP. WE WENT TO GET TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PER YEAR -- SO SERVE ONE OF THE THINGS PULLING THIS -- TAKING THESE NUMBERS -- MAKING THEM LOOK A LITTLE STRANGE IS A UC IRVINE WHICH IS PROPOSING TO DECREASE ITS ENROLLMENT THEY ARE SO SEVERELY OVER AND ROLLED RIGHT NOW. THAT THE STATES JUST CANNOT A CALL GOING ON THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH CLASSES. AND IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE. TO TO HAVE THAT MUCH ENROLLMENT SO THEY NEED TO DO BUT EVEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE IRVINE I GET THAT GIVES STILL BE. MUCH GREATER IF YOU DID TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PER YEAR. TIMES FOR YEARS. YOU'RE CORRECT THAT WOULD BE MORE -- WE'RE NOW SEEKING -- TO GROW OUR NUMBER OF DEGREES BY CLOSING DEGREE GAPS -- AND POTENTIALLY BRINGING BACK STUDENTS WHO PREVIOUSLY DROPPED OUT WHO HAVE A HIGH NUMBER OF UNITS WE CAN GET TO GRADUATE WITH DEGREES SO WE WOULD STILL HAVE GREATER DEGREE PRODUCTION. BUT WE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE GROWING OUR TOTAL ENROLLMENT. AS MUCH AS BUT WE BUT WE WOULD STILL GROW IT BY OVER THREE HOUSE. OKAY AND THEN LASTLY ON THAT THE MARGINAL COST INCREASE. THAT THE TRADITIONAL NUMBER WE'VE. WE'VE -- AGREED UPON AS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN NET NON ESSAY AGREED UPON THAT THAT WAS A STATE. NUMBER BUT YOU SEE HAS CONTINUALLY DISAGREED ON THAT NUMBER IN THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PUSHED BACK OVER THE YEARS -- REALLY HARD SO WHEN ASKED APART -- COMMENTS ON THE REQUEST TO FIND STUDENTS AT THE ELEVEN THOUSAND AND SOME CHANGE OF ABOVE. AND DOES THIS DOES THE DOCUMENTATION WARRANT SUCH AN AND AN INCREASE AND IF NOT WHY -- CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THEIR MARGINAL COST CALCULATION IT AND HAS THAT METHODOLOGY REMAIN THE SAME YEAR OVER YEAR OVER YEAR -- BUT CERTAINLY AT THIS TIME -- THE HIT THE PRACTICE THE THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TO A FUNDED ROMAN GROWTH AT TEN THOUSAND PER ADDITIONAL STUDENT. I'M MORE HAPPY TO LOOK AT WHAT YOU SEE IS PROVIDING -- AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE WOULD RETURN LATER -- YOU IF WE WERE TO PROPOSE ENROLLMENT GROWTH WITH A AN AMOUNT THAT IS SOMEWHERE -- EITHER -- RIGHT YOU ARE IF WE DISAGREE WITH THE METHODOLOGY AT THAT TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR RATE. OKAY IT WOULD SEEM AT THE MINIMUM THERE SHOULD IT SHOULD BE A COLA. A WEEK WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY OF THAT SO YOU TO FOR DIDN'T AGREE ON THAT THE HIGHER NUMBER SOME TYPE OF A CALCULATION I KNOW. THAT WE HAD WE'VE HAD THAT IN OTHER. EDUCATION -- MARKERS AS FAR AS THE MARGINAL COSTS CORRECT YES CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TO LOOK AT AT SOMETHING LIKE -- APPLYING COLA -- CERTAINLY HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT AND WE HAVE GIVEN THE MARGINAL COST COLIN CREASE FOR CSU OVER THE YEARS CORRECT. YET CSU HAS A VERY SPECIFIC CALCULATION THAT LOOKS AT THE COST OF INSTRUCTION -- AND THAT ACCOUNTS FOR AYE THOSE COSTS HAS THEY'RE CHANGING OVER TIME -- AND IT'S IT'S BEEN A CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY FROM CSU YEAR OVER YEAR OVER. OKAY THANK YOU DESERVE I JUST HAVE A LOT MORE YAK BROWN ON THE MARGINAL COST I MEAN I WE WE STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ACTUALLY WAS. LOOKING AT THE YEAR OVER YEAR COMPARISON -- DID THIS MORNING AND I I HAVE SOME COSTS ABOUT THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT THAT -- WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW TOO IS THAT THE MORE THE MARGINAL COST WORKERS AS IF THERE'S A TOTAL COST OF INSTRUCTION AND THEN THERE'S A STATE AND A STUDENT SHARE. AND THE STUDENTS HERE DEPENDS ON WHAT TO WHICH IT IS AND SO IF TUITION. DOESN'T INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR THAT THAT. COST OVERALL COST INCREASES BORN BY THE STATE'S SHARE AND SO IN YOUR WERE TUITION IS INCREASING THE THAT WAS STATE FOR WILL RISE FASTER THAN THE TOTAL COST OF THE TOTAL. A MARGINAL COST AND SO THAT'S PARTLY WHY YOU CO A LARGER SORT OF INCREASE ON THE STAGE HERE WHICH IS THAT 1-000-021-1000. FIVE HUNDRED THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR A IS -- FOR VIRGIN YES YES -- FIRST AGO SOME PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS OF THE DAY I I KNOW THE MASTER PLAN -- CALLS FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO DRAW FROM THE TOP TWELVE POINT 5% OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES FOR FRESHMAN ADMISSION. HOW? HOW ARE THOSE THE TWELVE POINT? GRADUATES IDENTIFIED I MEAN IS IT STRICTLY GRADES AND AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE OR OTHER ARE THERE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. WILL IT WILL LOOK AT GRADES AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE BUT WE ALSO LOOK AT WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS BY ZIP CODE SO -- IF IF THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF WELL ACHIEVING HIGH SCHOOLS WITHIN A PARTICULAR ZIP CODE. THEY WOULD HAVE -- EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE WELL ACHIEVING STUDENTS IN THAT. IN THAT. DISTRICT. OF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT WITHIN DOT DISTRICT NOT STATE WIDE NECESSARILY. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A A POLICY OF ADMITTING THE TOP 9% OF EVERY HIGH SCHOOL. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT CORRECT. THESE THESE QUESTIONS I HAVE -- I HAVE SOMEONE MISSIONS EXPERTS HERE WHO OMIT THESE QUESTIONS MAY BE. THEY MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS MORE PRECISELY WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CALL THEM THE TABLE. VIA -- CHAIRS INDULGENCE JR YOU CAN. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR SYSTEM WIDE PROVOST DOCTOR MICHAEL BROWN. SO YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT THE ELIGIBILITY IN A LOCAL CONTEXT AND WE DO DEFINE PART OF OF THE ELIGIBILITY POOL BASED ON RANK IN THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL. AND SO THE TOP 9% -- IS IS CONSIDERED AS PART OF DEFINING THE ELIGIBILITY. SO IT'S TAUGHT 9% OF EVERY SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- OF A REPUBLIC HI [inaudible] YES. EVERY PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AND AND SO HOW IS THAT RECONCILED WITH THE MASTER PLAN -- GOAL OF THAT THE AT THE HIGHEST TWELVE POINT 5% I SEEM TO TWELVE HI IS TWELVE POINT 5% IS IS A STATE WIDE. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IN THE TOP TWELVE POINT 5% STATE WIDE. THEN. IT'S A YEAR YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE OR THE GOAL IS THAT YOU'RE GUARANTEED A SPOT AT AT ONE OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUS THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WE ARE WE ARE TRYING AND A HALF PERCENT AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE GOAL IS TO BROADLY REPRESENT CALIFORNIANS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND TO LOOK AT ALL OUR AND AS BROADER RANGE OF ACHIEVEMENT INDICATORS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN SO -- AND WE KNOW THAT GRADES AND TEST SCORES ALONE. I DO NOT DEFINE A PERSON'S MERIT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PERHAPS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND HOW BROADLY WERE LOOKING AT IT. AND WHAT AND WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE STATE TO ENROLL AND THOSE ARE DIFFERENT SO -- AND SO -- THAT -- THAT TOP TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT -- HOW MAY BE AN IMPORTANT GOAL FOR THIS BODY -- BUT WE HAVE HEARD AND BELIEVE AT THAT THIS BODY WANTS US TO LOOK AS BROADLY ARE AT AT AT THE EXCELLENCE THAT STUDENTS MAY BRING. AS POSSIBLE ARE AND THAT -- AND THAT ONCE WE DEFINE WHO IS THE TOP -- THEN WE NEGOTIATE WITH THE STATE THEY'RE SEPARATE ISSUES. I MEAN I I I JUST ANY OF THAT THE THE 9% GOAL OUT OF EVERY. PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS -- A A REACTION TO PROPOSITION TWO OR NINE TO TO TRY -- TO INSURER -- AT THAT DIVERSE COMMUNITIES -- A THAT -- STUDENTS FROM FROM ALL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT SAID A CALIFORNIA HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IT. IT'S IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT CORRECT -- HAVE I THINK IT WAS PART OF THE MOTIVATOR OUR I THINK THE I AS IS OFTEN THE CASE -- ARE BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT AND BY THE WAY I I COME AT THIS FROM MANY MANY ANGLES FOR YEARS ALSO CHAIRED BY THE BOARD OF ADMISSIONS AND RELATIONS ARM OF THE THE UNIVERSITY OF THE FINE OUR GOAL IS -- TO TO REPRESENT AS BROADLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. PARTICULARLY GIVEN HOW SELECTIVE THE UNIVERSITY IS HOW FEW SPACES THERE ACTUALLY ARE GIVEN THE DEMAND. IS TO TO REPRESENT AS BROADLY AS WE CAN -- THIS THIS STUDENTS OF OUR STATE AND TO LOOK AT AS MANY OF THE OF THE FACTORS THAT WOULD DEFINE THAT EXCELLENCE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN ONE OF THE BEST PREDICTORS OF A STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY. IS ACTUALLY THEIR GPA AND AND ACTUALLY AMONG THE BEST PREDICTORS IS HOW A STUDENT RANKS IN THEIR GPA. AND THEIR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL THE REASON WHY THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL IS EXAMINED IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT CONTEXT IN WHICH STUDENTS ARE PERFORMING. AND IT IS REASONABLE -- TO LOOK AT HOW STUDENTS ARE FARING IN THEIR LOCAL CONTEXT -- AGAINST THAT PARTICULAR CRITERIA SO I MEAN DO WITH THE THE REASON WHY I'M ASKING THESE QUESTIONS IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I A FOR EXAMPLE I I WHICH IS. IT HAD A TALKING TO A A ACCORDING TO THE STUDENT TO HE HE SCORED. TO IN A TWENTY TWO HUNDRED ON THE ON THE OLD SAT BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO GAIN ADMISSION TO A SINGLE. UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA CAMPUS ARE I I DON'T KNOW IF HE IF HE APPLIED. TO TO BE LESS IMPACTED CAMPUSES MAY MAYBE HE TO SUPPLY. TO TO TO THE IMPACT OF CAMPUSES BUT YOU KNOW JUST ANECDOTALLY I I HEAR SO MANY STORIES LIKE THIS -- IS SO THAT YOU KNOW WAIT WAIT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO A YOU KNOW STUDENTS FROM A A HIGH ACHIEVING HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW. IF IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE. IN A THEIR IT'S HARDER TO GET INTO THE UC CAMPUS OF THE CHOICE AT A HIGH ACHIEVING HIGH SCHOOL VERSES AT EIGHT LOWER ACHIEVING HIGH SCHOOL. I I HAD AS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I THINK ALL OF US ARE ACTUALLY VERY CONCERNED -- ARE OUT I WAS JUST TALKING WHO ARE BROUGHT WITH ME HAN ME YOU MOVE. AND FOR IT -- AND AND WHAT WE FIND IS WE HAVE A TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS. OF FROM CALIFORNIA IS THE FROM FROM CALIFORNIA STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR ADMISSION AND TO USE THE BEST TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND AND AND MOST CAMPUSES ARE MADE IN BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE THOUSAND LOOKING TO ENROLL. BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS PER CAMPUS THAT'S NINE CAMPUSES WHAT WE REALLY NEED ARE MORE YOU SEE QUALITY SEATS. OF AVAILABLE -- AND HI AND SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES -- THERE'S ACTUALLY PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO GROW. AND SO IF WE CAN ADDRESS THAT -- HI AND IF THE STATE WAS COMFORTABLE WITH WITH ENROLLING MORE STUDENTS -- AND I HAVE HEARD THAT AS A AS A PARTICULAR AIM OF THIS BODY -- ODD THEN THEN THEN WE QUE -- BUT IT'S IT'S CREATING THOSE NEW SEATS IT'S FUNDING THOSE NEW SEATS -- ENABLING SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES TO GROW THAT CAPACITY. UNDERSTAND THAT ON SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES THERE'S ACTUALLY. THERE'S AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO GROW ACTUALLY MORE SICK OKAY I MADE IT I YEAH I I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT THE I.. DOES THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAVE LIKE DATA ON WHO. YOU KNOW QUALIFIES AMONG THE TOP YEAH [inaudible] OKAY. AND AND DOES THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAVE DATA ON ON WHO QUALIFIES WITHIN THE TOP TWELVE WHAT. TWELVE POINT 5% STATE WHAT WOULD WE HAVE THAT TOO WE DO WE DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY OURSELVES -- SO IN THE E. L. C. PROCESS AS I REMEMBER IT -- THE THE SCHOOL SUBMIT THE CREDENTIALS OF THEIR STUDENTS -- ON THE EIGHT AT G. REQUIRED COURSES THAT -- YOU SEE AND SEE ISSUE REQUIRE -- WE ACTUALLY PERFORMED THAT RANKING OURSELVES -- TO ASSURE OURSELVES OF THE INTEGRITY OF THAT PROCESS AND THAT IT'S THAT THIS EQUIVALENTLY APPLIED DROUGHT -- THROUGHOUT THAT THAT RANKING PROCESS SO YOU HAVE RANKINGS -- BITE BY STUDENT NAME -- WHETHER THEY FALL WITHIN. THE AT THE THE THE ADMISSION BAD WITH. THAT THAT EXIST SWORDS DETERMINABLE WE ACTUALLY ALSO FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE CLOSE COULD REMEMBER THAT'S DONE IN THEIR JUNIOR YEAR FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE CLOSE -- I I BELIEVE IT'S PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S -- PROCESS FACTUALLY SEND OUT A LETTER THAT TO THOSE STUDENTS THAT LOOK AT THAT THAT SIGNAL SO THAT STUDENT YOU'RE PROJECTING -- ELIGIBILITY KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK YOU COULD CONTINUE YOUR PROGRESS AND AND YOU MAY END UP -- WE ACTUALLY USE THAT PROCESS AS AN OUT REACH TOOL AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MEMBER TING. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- DELAYS ARE. QUESTIONS TO COULD COULD YOU GO BACK TO PAGE ELEVEN OF YOUR POWER POINT PRESENTATION. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE WRONG NUMBERS [inaudible] BEHIND THAT. I'M NOT IN FRONT OF ME BUT I CAN PROVIDE THEM TO YOU DOES ANYBODY HAVE AFFORDABLE. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF YOU SEE IT PEOPLE HERE. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR NON RESIDENT AS WELL I DON'T HAVE THE POWER YES AND I WANT I WANT TO KNOW THE NUMBERS BEHIND THE PERCENTAGES. I'M SORRY I I WE HAVE THE DATA TO BUT NOT IN FRONT OF ME WE HAVE THAT RESIDENTS BUT NOT THE NON RESIDENTS -- SOME JUST GONNA KIND OF DULL DOVE TAIL AND I THINK ONE OF THE ONE OF OUR CONCERNS STEMMING FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN IN MISTER MERCE CHEN I STARTED ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE BOTH. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIRTEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN TO TODAY. THE NON RESIDENT ROMA CONTINUES TO SKYROCKET WHILE -- THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN THE FRANKLY THE ONLY COMMITTEE REALLY CHAMPIONING THE VERY SMALL INCREMENTAL GROWTH IN IN STATE ENROLLMENT SO I GUESS THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE -- UNLIMITED ROOM FOR NON RESIDENTS -- INKED INCLUDING THIS YEAR WHERE YOU HAD OVER IN ROME AND A NUMBER OF CAMPUSES FOR NON RESIDENTS YET. AGAIN THE THE PEOPLE SEEM -- TO CONTINUE TO BE SORT OF CAPPED AT A LIMIT SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT AND HOW YOU CAN ADDRESS. THIS -- HOW HOW HOW DOES THE THE UNIVERSITY PLAN ON? REALLY -- STOP BEING EACH CAMPUSES INSATIABLE THIRST FOR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AT THE EXPENSE OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. OF WELL SIR -- OUR BOARD OF REGENTS HAS ADOPTED A POLICY TO CAP EACH OF THE CAMPUS'S ON THEIR NON RESIDENT INVOLVEMENT -- ALL OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES THEY DID NOT A BY BY THIS AT THIS YEAR -- ADMITTING STUDENTS IS A VERY. IT'S A VERY UP IMPRECISE PROCESS IN SOME WAYS WE SET OUR RESIDENT AND NON RESIDENT TARGET SEPARATELY SO WE SET THE NUMBER OF NON. RESIDENTS THAT -- ARE UNDER THE CAP THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ADMIT TO SEPARATELY FROM THE RESIDENT NUMBER SO -- THE AS THE THE CAMPUS IS KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO EXCEED DODD AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN ACTION TO REMOVE ANY POTENTIAL PROFIT FROM THOSE CAMPUSES THAT EXCEEDED THE CAP. I'M PROVIDED US BASIC NEEDS SERVICES STAR NEEDIEST CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS I DO HAVE THE LARGEST. NUMBER OF THE YOU DO HAVE THE NUMBER OF I FOUND THEM SO FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE HEAD COUNT WAS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES WITH THIRTY THREE AND NON RESIDENT UNDERGRAD. SIXTY AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT I WENT OVER THERE NO WAY TO KNOW. NINE I DON'T HAVE THAT I HAVE TWENTY TEN SORRY MAJOR ONES AREN'T ANY TEN TWENTY TEN WAS ARE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WERE HUNDRED AND 680-006-0020. TWO AND TOTAL NON RESIDENTS WERE. TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE HEAD COUNT SO YOU ADDED -- TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NON RESIDENTS AT THE TIME AND IT LOOKS LIKE -- ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. THAT WHENEVER I'M HERE SIR THAT'S CORRECT. I THINK THERE THERE'S YOUR ANSWER MR MERCER. I WILL I WILL POINT OUT THAT WE CURRENTLY GOV ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE FROM THESE NON AND WE'LL WE'LL WEEK FULLY UNDERSTAND THE REASON THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR THE MONEY SO IT'S NOT THAT'S THAT'S BEEN VERY CLEAR IN ALL THE TESTIMONY. HELLO THIS IS. YOU YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT REALLY. I'VE GOT THAT'S THAT'S SO YOU'RE YOU'RE COUNTERING WHAT EVERY EVERYBODY ELSE AS WHEN THEY COME HERE SO. PLEASE THE LIMóN. WE ARE SAFE FROM AN FROM AN ACADEMIC POINT OF VIEW -- THE VALUE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IS NOT JUST FOR THE MONEY SO THEN LET ME PUSH BACK ON THAT BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WHEN WAS THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FOUND. AT EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIFTY SIXTY SO FOR THE FIRST. HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF EXISTENCE. BY PERCENT WAS ABOUT WHAT IT WAS SO. SO AFTER A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS UNIVERSES CITED THERE IS VALUE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. I OUR OUR HI I I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR RATIONALE IN LOGIC DOES NOT IT'S NOT RATIONALE IS JUST IT'S IT'S JUST BEING HONEST RIGHT SO. THE UNIVERSITY FOUND VALUE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WHEN THEY COULD GO. RECOUP MONEY FROM. SO THERE WASN'T VALUE FOR THE FIRST HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS. WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS AT BERKELEY WHICH WAS WASN'T THAT LONG AGO BUT WAS AWHILE AGO? IT'S 5%. YEAH THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER FOR NOT JUST INTERNATIONAL BUT OUT OF STATE AS WELL AS THE MEMBER TING AYE I THINK. IT IS TRUE. THAT THERE IS OUR ECONOMIC VALUE I'M NOT DENYING THAT I'M SAYING THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON WHY I'M NOT DISSING THAT'S THE BY FAR THE PRIMARY REASON. SO I THINK WHAT YOU SAY SOUNDS NICE RHETORICALLY. EARLY THAT IT DOESN'T JIVE WITH THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY. AND IT DOESN'T JIVE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN ACADEMICALLY THERE WAS THIS -- LES PAUL THAT WENT ON THAT -- WHILE WE REALLY NEED TO BECOME MORE INTERNATIONAL. I I I I APPRECIATE THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO HELP OKAY. YOU KNOW THE WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ON WE HEARD A RATIONALE. WE DON'T BUY IT. IT SOUNDS LIKE. GET -- IF IF IF THE END THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT YOU COULD GET FROM INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WENT DOWN. I WOULD I BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD NOT FIND AS MUCH VALUE FROM THE I'LL JUST BE FRANK. SO THE QUESTION AGAIN IS I GO MISTER MCCARTY AND I NEGOTIATED THAT DEAL TO CAP IT 18% IN THE HOPE WAS REALLY. THAT WE WOULD SEE A FLAT OF OUT OF STATE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT APPEARS THAT NOT ONLY HAS A NOT FLAT IT CONTINUES TO RISE. SO I THINK IT MADE THIS YEAR WE MAY HAVE TO GO BACK AND RE REVIEW WHETHER THAT 18% IS A JACK NUMBER OR NOT. SIR MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE STAYED BELOW THAT CAPITAL BY BUS TICKET DEALS ON RESIDENTS IS SLOWING DEFINITELY SLOWING DOWN. I ALSO DO WANT -- TO OFFERED THAT THE REASON THE NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT INCREASED SO DRAMATICALLY WAS DE. UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC CRISIS THE STATE FACED -- BACK WHERE WE WENT BACK WHEN YOU WERE AN UNDERGRADUATE AT UC BERKELEY AND IT WAS RANKED THIRD IN THE WORLD. NOT AMONG PUBLIX BUT AMONG ALL UNIVERSITIES THE STATE WAS FUNDING 70% OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS THERE. NOW THE STATE FUNDS 40% AND BERKELEY'S RANKING BUT FIFTEENTH. OF WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PUBLIC'S NO WE'RE NOT ARGUING WHETHER OR NOT FIND IT LIKE AGAIN. WE LOOK -- IN A PROPOSED BROWN. IS GIVING. AN AN ARGUMENT THAT TO ME IN BUDGET COMMITTEE WHY THE REASON THIS IS A CAR. AND SO WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU. WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU IN FACT YOU LEAD WITH WE GET ONE POINT SOMETHING BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TO WASN'T HEY. WE'RE GETTING OUR RANKINGS HIGHER BECAUSE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS SHE DID SAY THAT DISH SO AGAIN. WE NEGOTIATE THIS AGREEMENT THE HOPE WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE A FLATTENING OF OUT OF STATE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS SO THAT CONSTITUENTS FIRM MISTER MERCER CHEESE HIGH SCHOOL COULD. GET THERE -- TO YOU SEE. BECAUSE THAT GOES WITH THE SLOTS THAT THOSE SLOTS ARE BEING TAKEN UP. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MAY HAVE TO RE DISCUSS GOING IN TO THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE HOPE WAS THAT HE WAS GOING. TO FLATTEN BUT THE FACT THAT IT KEEPS GOING UP IS VERY TROUBLING. MURATSUCHI YES THANK IF I JUST QUICKLY FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- MADE. OF ALONG THE SAME LINES IS -- CHAIRMAN KINGS -- GUIDE COMMENTS ME LOOKING AT THE THE SLIDE ON PAGE. ELEVEN I MEAN I I I KNOW WE WE CAN SPEAK FROM -- FOR FROM OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT -- FROM. FOR NINETEEN BUDGETS -- WE HAVE INCREASED -- STATE GENERAL FUNDING FOR A OF FOR THE UC'S AND YET THE PERCENTAGE OF THE NON RESIDENTS COULDN'T HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW. SO THAT. SEEMS TO UNDERMINE YOUR ARGUMENT LIKE THE ARGUMENT THAT'S THAT'S THAT WE HEAR MOST -- OFTEN THAT. THAT YOU'RE HAVING TO ADMIT MORE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS BECAUSE THE STATE -- IS IS IS IS -- IN THE STATE CONTRIBUTION TO YOUR CORE FUNDS ARE DECLINING. COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. DURING DURING THE BUDGET CRISIS -- AND I I TALK ABOUT FOR TWENTY THIRTEEN ON YES WE LOST SO MUCH MONEY THAT WE'VE BEEN BUT ALSO WHEN WE HAD TO LAY OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE AND NOW WE'RE SER CATCHING UP AND IS FUNDS ARE REQUIRED FOR THAT. AND AND AND AND OUR TOTAL ENROLLMENT KEEPS GROWING SO THE NUMBERS THE HEAD COUNT OF RESIDENTS HAS BEEN AND THE F. T. OF RESIDENTS HAS BEEN GROWING DURING THAT TIME. SO WE ARE LEADING IN. FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. YEAH YOU KNOW I I I I I KNOW THAT'S THE THE THE ARGUMENT THAT THAT WE THAT THE ALWAYS MAKE. REGISTER AYE AYE AYE BUT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY I I HAVE A HARD TIME TRYING. TO KEEP TRACK I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THIS IS. YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY MOVING PIECES HERE THAT -- THAT -- YOU KNOW WERE E. A. B. WE ALWAYS COME BACK TO THAT ARGUMENT THAT THAT OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA MAKES THAT. THAT YOU'RE HAVING TO ADMIT MORE OUT OF STATES TO BEING YOU ENOUGH MONEY AND SO THEREFORE IT'S SOMEHOW IT'S OUR FAULT. YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WITH IT Y. WE'RE NOT ADMITTING -- TO MORE MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- YOU KNOW I I APPRECIATE TO THE PROVOST'S ARGUMENT ABOUT THE OF THE VALUE OF DIVERSITY IN THE VALUE OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS IN THE VALUE OF OF OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. BUT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE YOU KNOW ALL OF US HERE ARE ELECTED BY. THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AND AND AND I YOU KNOW I I THINK WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. THAT YOU KNOW [inaudible] I I YOU KNOW IT I I BELIEVE ALL OF US HERE. YOU KNOW. ICE MORE VALUE ON CALIFORNIA RESIDENTSTHAN WE DO ON THE BENEFITS OF DIVERSITY OF OUT OF STATE IN INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU. OKAY FOLLOW UP FOR MR TING AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMóN AND THEY WANT TO GET TO THE NEXT ISSUE ITEMS SO WHAT FUNDING LEVEL WOULD. WHAT FUNDING LEVEL WHAT IT TAKES? TO ON FLATTEN NON RESIDENT STUDENT ENROLLMENT -- I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT ONE I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BECAUSE WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR FUTURE YEAR INFLATION SET LOOK IN THE INTERJECT LAST YEAR IN OUR FINAL BUDGET WE PUT LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET. ASKING US TO GO DOWN 210%. WHICH WOULD. BE I AM OPTIMISTIC BUT ONE THAT WE THINK WE WOULD EMBRACE AND I THINK IN THAT WE ASK FOR AN APRIL ONE REPORT FROM THE UC TO US AND SO IS HIGHER THAN THAT IT IS NOW OKAY ARE COMING IN THE LAST STAGES OF REVIEW I BELIEVE SO. SOCIAL WHAT VERY WIDE MY CONCERN REGARDING THE OUT OF STATE EMPLOYMENT ALSO IS. THAT THERE'S REALLY NO INCENTIVE PUT IN PLACE FOR ANY OF THE CAMPUSES TO REDUCE ANY OF THE OUT OF STATE A WOMAN BECAUSE IT'S FRANKLY ONE OF THE ONLY DISCRETIONARY POTS OF MONEY THAT THE CHANCELLOR HAS AT THEIR CAMPUS. IF I WITH PARTICULAR CHANCELLOR. DISCRETIONARY MONEY AS WE ALL KNOW IS INVALUABLE. SO I WOULD BE CURIOUS AS TO WHAT POLICIES THE REGENTS OR THE OFFICE PRESENT ARE PUT IN PLACE TO CREATE -- OF INCENTIVES TO MOVE TOWARD IN STATE AND WALNUT OR DISINCENTIVES. TO CONTINUE TO BE RELIANT ON OUT OF STATE AND ROMAN. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND FOR THAT -- CURRENTLY THE WAY THE STATE FUNDS GET DISTRIBUTED IT IS AN EQUAL AMOUNT FOR EACH CAMPUS REGARDLESS OF COST OF LIVING OR ANYTHING ON THOSE. THAT THEY GET PER STUDENT IN STATE FUNDING THAT CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF I BELIEVE A TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT STATE AUDITOR REPORT TO CRITICIZE YOU SEE FOR GIVING DIFFERENTIAL DOLLARS PER STUDENT AT OUR CAMPUSES. SO NOW THE STATE FUNDS ARE PROVIDED ACROSS THE BOARD EQUALLY EVERYTHING. THE SO SO BERKELEY SAN DIEGO UCLA THE THREE MOST DESIRABLE CAMPUSES IT MADE THE MOST OUT OF STATE STUDENTS. SO THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST INCENTIVE. TO MAINTAIN THAT LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT. THAT IS THAT TRUE. THEY ALSO HAVE SOME OF THIS HIGHEST COSTS SO A FACULTY MEMBER -- THE FACULTY THE SOME OF THE FACT THAT WE WANT TO LOOK REPORT COSTS BY JUST SAYING SO. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MOST DESIRABLE CAMPUSES. THE TAKING THAT THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF OUT OF STATE ENROLLMENT I THINK BELIEVE SO THAT IS IN DIRECT COMPETITION TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WERE TRYING TO GET INTO THE THREE MOST DESIRABLE. CAMPUS AS WELL BECAUSE EACH CAMPUS MAKES A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA MONEY FROM THE NON RESIDENT THEY CAN USE THOSE FUNDS TO ACTUALLY HIGHER LECTURERS OR FACULTY TO TEACH RESIDENTS STUDENTS AND IF WE LOST THAT ADDITIONAL REVENUE. WE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF COURSES AND SERVICES PROVIDED THE RESIDENT STUDENTS SO IT'S A BIT OF A TANGLED ISSUE. IN THAT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF THERE'S A PERSON SITTING IN A CHAIR BUT THAT PERSON IS ACTUALLY FINANCING DEAL ABILITY I DON'T. COMPLICATED ISSUE AS YOU MAKE A SOUND I THINK IT REALLY COMES DOWN. TO YOU KNOW AYE CHANCELLOR NEEDS TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGET AND THIS IS THIS IS THE WAY THEY BALLOTS I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO SO I THINK A BALANCE IT. ANOTHER WAY THAT MAYBE THEY WOULD CONSIDER AT THAT THIS OUR OUR UNIVERSITIES HAVE VERY. VERY FEW LEVERS FOR FUNDING GREAT EXAMPLE YEAH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA THANK YOU I I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND I THINK THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHTING ONE OF THE GREATER COMPLEXITIES -- OF THIS I MEAN IN THIS IN THIS LAST I THINK TWENTY MINUTES OF DISCUSSION -- BETWEEN -- THE MEMBERS AND YOU SEE REPRESENTATIVES. YOU KNOW. I I'VE HEARD THAT TO SOME EXTENT SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD WERE MET -- WHICH WAS TO INCREASE TO ADD IS THAT IN STATE -- STUDENT ENROLLMENT THAT THAT'S AN OBJECTIVE THAT HAS BEEN MET THAT IS A PRIORITY TO US -- I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES WE'VE HAD -- HAS ALSO BEEN. TO KEEP AND MAINTAIN THE COST OF TUITION FROM GOING UP AND THAT HAS BEEN MET -- AND YOU KNOW I I STRUGGLE WITH WHAT THE RIGHT IS. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS ANY AS AS AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER SUIT SHE SAID THERE THERE IS ANY DEBATE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE THAT LEGISLATORS PLACE ON ALLOWING. ACCESS. TO ONE OF OUR PRIME TREASURES THE UC'S FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THAT IS UNQUESTIONABLE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S DEBATED I STRUGGLE WITH REFLECTING ON WHAT A DISINVESTMENT LOOKS LIKE FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS -- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MAGIC NUMBER IS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BALANCE IS I MEAN THE QUESTION WAS POSED IF WE GAVE X. AMOUNT OF MONEY I MEAN ESSENTIALLY. RIGHT THEN DOES THAT. DECREASE OR DOES THAT STOP OUT OF STATE IN ROME IT FROM GOING UP -- BUT THE TRUTH IS IS THAT. WHEN THERE IS AN OVERALL BUDGET? I AT LEAST THE WAY THAT I SAW IT WORK OUT IT DIDN'T SAY IT WILL THIS IS HOW MUCH OUT OF STATE STUDENTS ARE BRINGING IN AND THIS IS HOW MUCH STAYS FOR OUT OF STATE. THIS IS HOW MUCH MONEY ALL COMES IN AND HELPS EVERYONE A LOT OF THE STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES DON'T MAKE. DON'T DISTINGUISH BY WHETHER YOU'RE AT THERE'S AN OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT IF YOU GO TO DISABLE STUDENT SERVICES IF YOU IDENTIFY WITH AN ETHNIC GROUP AND YOU GO TO THAT YOU KNOW CULTURAL CENTERS -- IF YOU GO TO CHIU DURING IF YOU GO TO ANY OF THIS THAT SAME POT OF MONEY IS HELPING ALL STUDENTS. AND I STRUGGLE WITH THIS I DO -- BECAUSE I A THINK THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS LEGISLATORS TO REPRESENT -- THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE THE LOUDEST VOICES FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES WRIST RESEARCH. I ALSO CAUTION AS TO GET. TO BE CAREFUL ON HOW MUCH WE WANT TO OPEN UP. THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VALUE OF DIVERSITY BECAUSE AS SOMEONE WHO HAS HELP FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS -- LOW INCOME STUDENTS STUDENTS FROM ETHNICALLY UNDER REPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR SAME COMMENT THAT COME OUT OF OUR MOUTH FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE THE SAME COMMENTS THAT WILL BE USED. BY SOMETIMES OUR CONSTITUENTS TO MAKE THE CASE AGAINST FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS STUDENTS WHO APPLY FOR AT STUDENTS WHO. ARE. BENEFITING FROM US. FROM A CAL GRANDSON CERTAINLY FOR A DREAMER STUDENTS AND WE GOT AND IT'S CARE I MEAN I JUST WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL -- THAT THERE IS A VALUE TO DAY FOR STUDENTS -- AND IT YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT VALUE THAT WE HAVE STATED OUR BUDGET HAS STATED IT SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND THE RIGHT FORMULA -- TO INSURE THAT OUR OBJECTIVES CONTINUE TO GET MATT AS A STATE -- BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN POSED BY. STATE REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS ROOM TODAY THAT NEED TO BE FLESHED OUT. WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND DELIVER THIS MESS DELIVER THIS MESSAGE THEN YOU KNOW YOU HERE BECAUSE THAT IS OUR JOB TO TALK TO THE PUBLIC TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT OUR POLICIES ARE. AND SO IF THERE'S NOT CONFIDENCE ON OUR PART -- WE CAN'T PROJECT THAT CONFIDENCE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND IN THE END I'VE SAID IT OVER AND OVER THIS IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLY VALUED RESOURCE THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OF AND THAT I THINK IS AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. YES. OKAY THANK YOU SO I'LL TRY TO WRAP THIS UP HERE SO CLEARLY. THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT WE WANT TO SERVE ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT TALKING ABOUT YEARS CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND I'M MORE AND MORE STUDENTS ARE. ARE TAKING THE COURSES AND ELIGIBLE IN APPLYING HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND APPLICATIONS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. AND NOT ENOUGH FOR GETTING AND SO IT'S SUPPLY DEMAND ONE ON ONE AND WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER DID. SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT THIS THE NON RESIN ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY AND AND I TOTALLY CONCUR WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- TEAM JUST ON THE MATHEMATICS THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE DID THE POLICY. YOU KNOW I I THINK HE CAN YOURSELF AND AND BEING DISHONEST TO TELL US THAT. YOU KNOW FOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY YEARS ACTUALLY WERE FINE WITH MINUS 5% AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN -- WHEN THAT THE BUDGET WAS REALLY BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON I DON'T I DON'T BLAME THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THE THREE POTS OF MONEY? STUDENT FEES STATE MONEY AND NON RESIDENT TUITION YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR PIE CHART THEY'RE ALL THERE AND SO IT'S A THREE LEGGED STOOL SO NOW IT IS PART OF THE STILL FOR THE RIP ONE OUT. RASPY MONEY COMING SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE SEATED CALIFORNIA MONEY. FINE WHERE WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT I REALIZE WE HAVE OTHER. ISSUES AS WELL -- STUDENT FEET REVENUE -- YOU KNOW I KNOW WEEK PATTERSON SOMETIMES AS A COST AS WELL AS OVER. 50% NEARLY TWO THIRDS GET FINANCIAL AID PAY NO FEES THAT YOU SEE WITH CAL GRANT. MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND AND UNIVERSITY GRANT [inaudible] AND WITH THAT WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH MONEY TO EXPAND NONRESIDENT ROMANTIC -- SO. IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT -- HIS IS ON OUR ON OUR MINDS GOING FORWARD SO -- WITH THAT WE WENT -- TO HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND REVISIT IT -- FOR THE VISION AND MAYBE WE CAN EXCUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA GO AND ASK THE UC PANEL TO COME UP HERE. WE'RE GOING TO IT NOW TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE RELATES TO THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS CHEATING SCANDAL. AND AS THE AS THE I'LL WAIT TILL THE GROUP COMES UP. SO I I DECIDED TO AGENDA IS THIS WE DECIDE TO AGENDA IS THIS YOU KNOW WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE VERY AWKWARD TO TALK ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND EMISSIONS WOULD NOT -- ADDRESSING BEEN IN THE ROOM AND THAT IS THIS -- RECENT THAT NATIONAL COLLEGE EMISSIONS CHEATING SCANDAL ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHOWING THE REAL UGLY SIDE. OF COLLEGE ADMISSIONS AND AGAIN NOT JUST UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO TWO HIGH PROFILE EXAMPLE SO FAR -- OTHERS THAT THAT IS SO CALLED ELITE COLLEGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND JUST A JUST A JUST -- TO SUMMARIZE WHAT OUR US ATTORNEY SAID WHICH I THINK IS SO POWERFUL. HE SAID THERE CAN BE NO SEPARATE ADMISSIONS PROCESS FOR THE WEALTHY BUT THERE IT'S AND I THINK THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT A SECOND AGO WITH ENROLLMENT I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'S SO MADDENING FOR SO MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO GET INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE TO GET IN THERE ON THE STUDENTS ON THE PARENTS. AND WE SEE THIS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS DISPLACING CALIFORNIA KIDS BUT WHEN YOU SEE. OUT RIGHT FRAUD AND CHEATING TO TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE SCARE SEATS -- MAYBE IT'S TOO WE THINK IT'S MANY MORE WERE GOING TO GET TO THAT THAT THAT'S WAY TOO MANY. AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE AND TO OUR SOCIETY IS BASED UPON THE MERITOCRACY THAT WE THINK ARE MISSIONS. SYSTEM SHOULD BE FAIR AND JUST TO THE SHOULD BE THIS FRONT DOOR. AS THE THE NEW YORK TIMES ALLUDE TO LAST FOR A LOT OF MONEY THAT BY DORM AND IT'S THROUGH THESE LEGACY ADMISSIONS BUT THIS. A SIDE DOOR AS FAR AS ESSENTIALLY BRIBING PEOPLE UNDER THE TABLE IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS AND RAISES SO MANY -- QUESTIONS WE HAVE WAY MORE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS BUT WE DID WANT TO ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO TO GIVE US. AN AN UPDATE TODAY AND NOW SOME SPECIFIC -- FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AND SO YOU KNOW ALL OF SOME QUESTIONS AS FAR AS HOW DOES THIS HOW DID THIS HAPPEN. THE THE THE THE THE AMOUNTS OF INCIDENTS THAT WE KNOW OF SO FAR -- WHICH WE DO GOING FORWARD AS FAR AS LEGACY ADMISSIONS THESE TAG EMISSIONS FOR US FOR FOR ATHLETES -- TAKING A LOOK AT THE S. A. T. AND OTHER -- TEST ISSUES -- BUT AGAIN IT IS OUR IS OUR TWO CAMPUSES ARE ARE MARQUEE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE -- BLACK ICE -- SO FAR. AND WE WANT TO HAVE A A ROBUST DISCUSSION TODAY -- ON THIS ASSEMBLY -- HIGHER ED COMMITTEE AT AND THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ARE GONNA HOLD ANOTHER HEARING ON THIS BROADER LOOKING AT THE PRIVATE SITUATIONS CSU THE COLLEGE BOARD -- SO SO WITH THAT HE WENT -- TO ALLOW THE THE UC TO GET PRESENTATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT BUT THE BUT WE WANT TO ALLOW OPENING COMMENTS FROM A FEW PEOPLE AT FIRST INCLUDING CHAIRMAN MEDINA. THANK YOU -- CHAIR MCCARTY AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS ON THE AGENDA -- IN THE IN THE PAST SIX YEARS I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE -- THAT IS GOT THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC A MORE THAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST WEEK. IT WHEN I LOOK AT AT NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE NATION. FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE TO THE NEW YORK TIMES -- TO THE LA TIMES. YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE. THAT FOR SOME REASON REALLY IS CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AND AND I THINK BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE. PRECIOUS TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHEN I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER -- LIKE MY COLLEAGUE -- WE USED TO SAY THAT TWO THINGS MOST PRECIOUS TO FOLKS WERE THEIR CHILDREN. AND THEIR MONEY. AND THIS DEALS WITH BOTH OF THEM. YOU KNOW THIS DEALS WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM OF UPWARD MOBILITY. WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT HARD WORK PAYS OFF. SO THIS REALLY IS AN ISSUE THE TO THAT THEY CAN -- SHAKE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SHAKE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE STUDENTS THAT I TAUGHT. SHAKE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PARENTS WE REPRESENT. THAT THAT HARD WORK WILL PAY OFF IN THE END. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I I THINK WE WANT TO HOLD ON TO BUT IT IS SOMETHING IT IS A TOPIC THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND WILL HOW DID WE GET THERE. HOW DID WE GET TO THIS POINT? HOW DO WE GET TO THIS KIND OF OBSERVED PLACE WERE SOME PARENT IS WILLING TO PUT UP? HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER GOES TO A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION. WHY IS THAT OF SO MUCH VALUE? DOES THAT REALLY IS THERE REALLY THAT MUCH OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT IS GOING TO HAVE ON THE FUTURE OF THEIR CHILD. OR IS THERE SOMETHING MORE AT WORK. SO I I THINK IT IS A VERY BROAD ISSUE. THAT WE HAVE HERE IS I I THINK IT IS ALMOST A SOCIETAL ISSUE. AND THAT THERE ARE SOCIETAL QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED. IN IN THIS. I I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD IT IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT. FINDING WRONG DOING WITH A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION. OR A PARTICULAR SYSTEM BECAUSE ACROSS THE NATION SO MANY COLLEGES [inaudible] HAVE BEEN. I WOULD SAY SNOOKERED WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF TO TALK ABOUT A SIDE DOOR WHAT DO YOU FROM IS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CHEATING LINE FRAUD. IT ALSO THE COLLEGES SIDE DOOR OF YOU KNOW I HAVE ISSUE WITH THAT. BLATANT LINE BLATANT CHEATING OF BUYING PAYINGFOR SOMEONE TO TAKE YOUR YOUR COLLEGE. ENTRANCE EXAM IN A PHOTO SHOPPING -- ATHLETES PICTURES. SO I I WANT TO SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT I DON'T THINK THIS IS ABOUT LOOKING. FOR OF WRONGDOING ON THE PART OF A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. I THINK IT IS CLEAR THAT IT IS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN WRONGDOING WHETHER IT'S PARENTS. COACHES THE PROCTORS AND THAT THOSE PEOPLE. SHOULD AND WILL BE PROSECUTED I KNOW THAT COLLEGES ARE MOVING FORWARD TO LOOKING AT WHO WERE THE STUDENTS INVOLVED. AND IN THE CASE OF U. S. C. I THINK STUDENTS OF ALREADY BEEN RELEASE I THINK -- UNIVERSITIES LIKE U. S. C. OR LOOK STUDENTS WHO BENEFITTED FROM THIS AND IN IN THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS AND THEY WILL BE LOOKED AT AS WELL. SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT AT THE OUTSET. AND AND WE'LL BE HAPPY HEARING AND HAVING MORE HEARINGS ON THE TOPIC. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SURE MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE.

AS THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA GRADUATE MYSELF I WAS PERSONALLY OFFENDED TO LEARN BUT SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS ARE ACCUSED OF CHEATING AND ACCEPTING BRIBES TO GAIN. AN UNLAWFUL ADMISSION TO SEVERAL UNIVERSITIES INCLUDING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AS OUTLINED IN THE CHARGES FILED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. LIKE MOST THE STUDENTS TODAY I WORK VERY HARD FOR MY ADMISSION TO UC BERKELEY. WRESTLING. I WANT TO REASSURE YOU THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY ILLEGAL INAPPROPRIATE OR UNETHICAL ATTEMPTS. TO GET ADMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY AT THE EXPENSE OF DESERVING APPLICANTS.

GOOD MORNING CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. IRAQ HAS HI MY NAME IS MICHAEL BROWN AND I AM THE CHIEF ACADEMIC OFFICER. ARE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WAS THE PAUL. ODD TO HEAR THE NEWS THAT BROKE LAST WEEK. ARE WE HAVE PERSONS OF WEALTH OF FAME. ARE OF INFLUENCE. OUR WHO DEVISED SCHEMES ARE TO FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE ADMISSIONS CREDENTIALS OF APPLICANTS. OUR WHERE THEY WERE THOSE APPLICANTS TRULY LEARNING DISABLED. AT AND WORTHY OF EXTRA TIME ON TAKING THE TESTS AND AND WHERE THEY COOLEY ATHLETES -- OUT WAS THE TEST PERFORMANCE REFLECTED. IN THEIR APPLICATIONS REALLY TRULY REFLECTIVE OF THEM AS STUDENTS AND ONE CAN EVEN RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT OTHER ASPECTS OF THE EMISSIONS CREDENTIALS BECAUSE WE DO NOW -- THAT EA EVEN THINGS LIKE GRADES -- AND EMISSIONS RECORDS ARE CAN BE -- AT GREAT RECORDS CAN BE FAKED -- IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY ENOUGH POWER THEIR WEALTH AND INFLUENCE WAS USED TO BRIBE THE CALL OUT TO COOPERATION OF OTHERS OUTSIDE OF THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE. ITSELF TO CREATE OUR AND I'D LIKE YOUR CHARACTERIZATION -- AT CHAIR MEDINA -- AS THEY CALL IT YOU FOR MYSTICALLY A SIDE DOOR BUT AS THE DOOR BURKE -- BORN OF OF CHIEF IN THE SEAT -- OF FRAUD -- HARD TO GET ACCESS TO OP PRECIOUS LEE RARE RESOURCE THAT THIS STATE IS STRUGGLING HARD TO FIND WAYS OF SUPPORT. OUR OUR ATHLETES -- ATHLETIC COACHES AND STANDARDIZED TESTING OFFICIALS WERE BRIBED AS PART OF THE SCHEME TO DECEIVE ADMISSIONS OFFICES OF OUR TOP UNIVERSITIES. ARE ALL AT THE EXPENSE OF DESERVING APPLICANTS. WHO WERE PLAYING BY THE RULES? OUR ARMED ARE BUT THIS WAS BENEATH THOSE FOLKS IS NOTICE -- BUT IT'S CLEARLY NOT BENEATH THE NOTICE OF MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. OUR THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INTOLERABLE. OUR AND OUR AND FOR ME AND MAYBE FOR MANY AND I'M I'M HEARING AND SOME OF THE COMMENTS ESPECIALLY GOLLY -- I THINK YOUR TERM I CHAIR ARE MCCARTY WAS MADDENING -- THAT THE EMISSION SYSTEM IS ALREADY CONSTRUED BY MANY AS RIGGED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH PEOPLE. OUR OB THINK ABOUT JUST ALL THE TEST PREP INTENSE COACHING -- THAT AT THAT THEY HAVE -- THE ABILITY TO PAY. FOR THE QUALITY OF SCHOOLING OUR MOST OF US KNOW ABOUT THE ZIP CODE AFFECT -- THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE WHERE THEY LIVE TO GET ACCESS TO BETTER SCHOOLS. WHAT ABOUT THE WITHIN SCHOOL TRACKING SYSTEM? ARE AND THE ABILITY TO GET -- EVEN JUST EIGHT A. G. COURSES -- BUT BUT DIDN'T YOU COULD TALK ABOUT GET ACCESS THE HONORS COURSES IN AP COURSES AND SO WORN. OUT -- AT AND WE KNOW WHERE THIS GOES IN WE KNOW WHO DOESN'T GET ACCESS TO THESE. ARE HOW ABOUT THE ACCESS TO JUST APPROVED A TO G. COURSE. ARE -- ARE OUT THE ABILITY TO EARN A HIGHER GPA WILL WE'D KNOW -- THIS PHENOMENON OF GRADE INFLATION IS GREATEST -- AT THE AT THE WEALTHIER SCHOOLS ACTUALLY NOT AT THE POORER SCHOOLS -- WE KNOW THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF COLLEGE GOING REACHED KNOWLEDGE IN RESOURCE -- IS ALSO TIED -- TO TO TO WEALTH AND INFLUENCE AT THE ACADEMIC SUPPORT STUDENTS HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM ACCESS TO POWERFUL A KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE FOR ADVICE INFORMATION FOR RECOMMENDATION -- AS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY REGARDED UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD OUR OUR UNIVERSITY THAT IS ALSO PUBLIC. ARE ARE YOU SEE HAS A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY. TO ENSURE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD -- IS IS AVAILABLE -- FOR AND SOME IN THE LEGISLATURE MAY KNOW -- THAT THIS DEDICATION IT IS NOT JUST THE DEDICATION FOR YOU SEE I PERSONALLY HAVE IT AND HAVE AYE I HOPE SOME OF YOU KNOW DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT OVER MY TWENTY SIX YEARS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY THE UNIVERSITY IS PROUD. THAT AND I AM TO THAT APPROXIMATELY 37% OF OURS ARE OF YOU SEE STUDENTS COME FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. ARE NO SEE ISSUE NO OUR AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITIES OUR SCHOOL HAS BOTH A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PALE ENROLLEES. ARE AT AND A HIGHER A PALE GRADUATION RATE THEN ARE UC CAMPUSES. WE HAVE NO LEGACY ADMISSIONS AT ARE PARTICULARLY PROUD -- THAT APPROXIMATELY 42402% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE FIRST OUR OUR OUR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. WITH RESPECT TO STUDENT ATHLETES CAMPUS BASED REVIEWERS -- WHICH INCLUDE FACULTY EVALUATE RECOMMENDATIONS ON ADMISSIONS MADE BY THE ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT BUT THEY ARE TWO MAR KNOWLEDGE BUT WE'RE GOING TO CHECK THIS OUT BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY DON'T ADMIT THE STUDENTS THEY THEY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT THEY GO TO A BODY AND MANY EYES LOOK ON OUR ON ON ON THE DECISION AND SO THE FINAL DECISION IS DETERMINED BY THAT BODY NOT THE ATHLETICS DEPARTMENT. BUT IF THERE'S SOME BREAKDOWNS HERE WE'LL LEARN THAT. OUR STUDENTS A MINUTE BY OUR BY EXCEPTION TO OUR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE A REASONABLE POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESS THAT THE UNIVERSITY -- THESE STUDENTS MUST SHOW THE POTENTIAL TO EARN A UC DEGREE. THE UNIVERSITY HAS NO SYSTEM WITH REGION WITH A WITH WITH A LONG NIGHT WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE OR OTHER INFLUENTIAL -- OUT I INDIVIDUALS. WE HAVE AN ADMISSIONS VERIFICATION PROCESS THAT RANDOMLY SELECT APPLICANTS ARE TO UNDERGO A SYSTEM WIDE VERIFICATION PROCESS OF THEIR ADMISSIONS CREDENTIALS. OUR PRIOR TO ADMISSION. SO THE ETHICAL BEHAVIOR OF A FEW INDIVIDUALS HERE. ONLY REINFORCES IN MY VIEW I UC'S UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO FAIRNESS AND EQUITY. MANY CALIFORNIANS I BELIEVE THAT SOCIETY IS NOT WORKING THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD -- THAT EVERYTHING IS SLANTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL. BOB. CAN OPPORTUNITY PARTICULARLY THIS PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY ARE YOU SEE EDUCATION BE MORE FAIRLY DISTRIBUTING. OUR IS SPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF SOCIAL INEQUITY. THE SAID IN DISMAYING CIRCUMSTANCES -- ARE ACTUALLY MAY END UP WORKING TO THE BENEFIT OF US ALL. ARE AS WE CONTINUE TO EXAMINE AND RE EXAMINE BOTH CURRENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES BOTH CURRENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER BROWN MISTER BUSTAMANTE INTO THAT WE APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE AND IT WAS IT'S A STRONG RESPONSE BOTH TODAY AND FROM THE THE UNIVERSITY I WILL SAY. BECAUSE IT'S AN ASSAULT ON THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE TAXPAYERS STUDENTS PARENTS WHO ARE TRYING. TO HUSTLE THE RIGHT WAY. TO GET THERE -- KIDS PREPARED TO ENTER THE NEAREST CALIFORNIA AND ITS ASSAULT ONON ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED AND IS THE EARLY STAGES. AND ALSO LOOK ABOUT LOOKING DO IDEAS FOR REFORM SO I'M GONNA START WITH A FEW QUESTIONS AND OPEN UP TO TO MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- ARDOR STANDING IS THE THE THE INDICTMENT THAT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK HAD. ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS -- NAMES ABOUT THIRTY HER CELL WERE PUBLIC A FEW HIGH PROFILE ONES WE'VE HEARD ABOUT -- OF WHICH I TO SO FAR WE KNOW ARE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ONE WITH THE UCLA WITH A SOCCER COACH ONE AT UC BERKELEY WITH THAT FRAUDULENT SAT SCORES. SO FAR DO WE KNOW OF OF ANY OTHER YOU SEE EXAMPLES BESIDES THAT HAVE AT BERKELEY AND UCLA. CURRENTLY NO BUT WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO -- TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FULL VISIBILITY ON THIS ISSUE IS WE'VE CONTACTED THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICES. AND THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION. AND HAVE. A INDICATED THAT WE WILL HELP IN ANY WAY. POSSIBLE TO FURTHER THEIR INVESTIGATIONS BUT BE ASK IF WE CAN GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ANYBODY ELSE. INVOLVED WITH THE UC SYSTEM THAT MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS. TYPE OF CORRUPTION ACT SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS IT FROM OUR END AND WE CAN USE THAT NATALIE TO INVESTIGATE THE THE MATTER AT HAND BUT TRY TO TIGHTEN OUR PROCESSES UP IT. AS WELL SO DO WE KNOW IF THE EIGHT HUNDRED THAT CASES IN THE IN THE U. FRAUDULENT EXAMPLES FOR PEOPLE UTILIZING THAT SERVICE IN OTHER WORDS. THE FELLOW WHO FOUNDED THE FIRM MISTER SINGER IS FROM SACRAMENTO. AND I HAVE HEARD OF FAMILIES IN THE LAST WEEK WHO HAVE UTILIZED TO SERVICES AND AND THEY THEY CLAIM THAT IT WAS THAT SAT PREP ADVICE ON WHAT CALL JUST APPLY FOR SO I SOON BEFORE HE ENDEAVOR IN THIS ILLEGAL ENTERPRISE HE HE PROBABLY WORK WITH SOME STUDENTS. ON THE UP AND UP. DO WE KNOW IF THAT LARGE NUMBER EIGHT HUNDRED ARE ALL FRAUDULENT EXAMPLES -- DIRECTOR TOTAL CASES I'M NOT PRIVY TO THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE CASE SO I WOULD BE SPECULATING -- I AGAIN WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. TO FIGURE OUT THE FULL SCOPE AND BREADTH OF THE IMPACT OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. RIGHT NOW I HAVE NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. OKAY ON ON THE ON THE EXAMPLES OF THE THE ATHLETES -- THAT'S THE THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST GALLING EXAMPLES HERE AT UCLA AND SAYS -- YOU KNOW SELAGINELLA YES THAT YOU SEE THERE CALLED TAG ADMITS WERE. THE COACH CAN CAN TAG THE STUDENT AS AN APPLICANT WHO MAYBE HAS SUB STANDARD GPA AND SAT SCORES BUT CAN. THEY CAN GET -- ADMISSIONS NOT THROUGH A SCHOLARSHIP BUT BY BEING A PLAYER ON AN ATHLETIC TEAM -- NOT YOU SEE THERE IS ONE EXAMPLE HEARD ABOUT WHERE THE STUDENT EVEN KNOW THAT HE WAS ALLEGEDLY PART OF THE TRACK TEAM AND SELL IT IT MAKES YOU WONDER OR STUDENTS -- ADMITTED -- TO UNIVERSITY TO PARTICIPATE THE SWIM TEAM AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM -- SO -- YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THIS ADMISSIONS VERIFICATION SYSTEM HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IS ADMITTED BASED UPON ATHLETIC PROWESS IN A CERTAIN SPORT AND THERE WASN'T FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE -- THAT'S LEGIT -- SO SO THAT'S THE FIRST HALF THE QUESTION ALL COME BACK. YES AT THE AT THE STAGE THAT THE EMISSIONS FOR FOR CATION PROCESS HAPPENS IT'S THAT THE APPLICATION STAGE THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND APPLICANTS. SO WE DON'T REVIEW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM AS A VERIFICATION PROCESS BUT THEY ARE RANDOMLY SELECTED -- I I A I AND NUMBER THAT WE BELIEVE -- ALLOWS US TO TEST AND ALSO SIGNAL SIGNAL -- THAT THAT THAT -- CREDENTIALS DO GET. OUT AND THOSE FOLKS ARE ARE ARE -- THAT THE PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF THEIR APPLICATIONS THAT THAT GENERATE EITHER QUESTIONS FOR US OR WE WANT TO DELVE FURTHER IN WE SEND -- FOLLOW A SET OF INFORMATION THAT THE STUDENT HAS TO RESPOND -- TO ART THROUGH THAT PROCESS -- EVERY YEAR ROUGHLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STUDENTS DON'T GO FURTHER NOW IT COULD BE FOR ANY NUMBER RESERVE IT MAY BE THAT THAT THAT THEY DECIDE THAT -- THEY CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. WE COULD BE THAT THEY DECIDE THAT THE THE PLACES THEY WANT TO GO THOSE APPLICANTS OR ADMIT APPLICANTS YEAH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ADMIT SO ONCE ONCE ADMITTED. WHAT'S THE SPOT CHECK. GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND WHAT SPECIFICALLY THE SPOT CHECK THEIR STUDENTS THAT ARE ADMITTED. FOR THESE ATHLETIC REASONS FOR THAT SPECIAL ADMITS THE SIDE DOOR AT ALL STUDENTS THAT ARE ADMITTED. TO THE UNIVERSITY OF REMEMBER THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR ADMITTED AROUND THE END OF THEIR THEIR JUNIOR YEARS. SO -- SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY ADMITTED ON CONDITION -- I'M MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY CONDITIONALLY ADMITTED THEY HAVE -- TO THEY INDICATE WHAT THEY'RE WHAT WHAT COURSES THAT DARE TO OUR OUT PLANNING TO TAKE IN THAT SENIOR YEAR -- THEY THEY WHAT WHAT ACTIVITIES THEY PLAN TO BE INVOLVED IN IN THAT NEXT YEAR AND SO ONCE THEY'RE IN MID AT THE CAMPUS IS ACTUALLY REVIEW TO SEE IF THEY DID WHAT. THE WHAT THE WHAT -- THE STUDENTS SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO. AND WHAT WERE THEIR GRADES AS REPORTED FROM THE SCHOOL -- BECAUSE AT THAT POINT WE ACTION NO THEIR ACTUAL TRANSCRIPTS WE ACTUALLY KNOW THEN AT THAT POINT WHAT COURSES THAT THEY REALLY TAKE -- SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS LIKE THAT ARE BETTER FOLLOWED UP PRIOR TO THAT STUDENT ENROLLED. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT GRADES NOR GPA THAT'S THAT THAT IS WHAT IT IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THERE ARE ALL RIDES YEAH THAT -- COACH SAYS YES THAT KIDS GOING TO BE A STRONG A WALK ON ATHLETES AND ADD SOME CHARACTER AND RESOLVE TO OUR TEAM WE WANT THEM IN. THE UNIVERSITY ON OUR TEAM EVEN THOUGH THEIR GRADES AREN'T UP TO PAR WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADMISSIONS OFFICER. DOESN'T JUST SAY OKAY COACH WILL GIVE YOU ONE AND THAT WE VERIFY THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS. ARE WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE THERE'S NO FRAUD AND GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT PROCESS I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YES THAT FROM MY PERCH. ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU VAST FROM THE EAST THE STUDENT ATHLETE UP. QUOTES AROUND THAT TO DETERMINE WHETHER AT THE PROPER PROCEDURES ARE BEING FOLLOWED WITH WE HAVE SEVEN I CAN IS SINCE TO VERIFY WHETHER THESE PEOPLE ARE ON THE UP AND UP. WHETHER THERE'S ENOUGH CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THE SYSTEM TO ASSURE THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE ICE ON THESE. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT MY AUDIT WILL BE LOOKING INTO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE STUDENT ATHLETE SITUATION LOOK AT THE ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT. WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES ALONG WITH TRYING TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS ALONG WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS. WE ARE NOW INVOLVED WITH AND HOPEFULLY GET ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL AGENCIES BUT YOUR ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED. IN THAT AUDIT AND WE'RE GOING TO SCREW UP THIS AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE OUR PROCESS THE SECTOR AND ALSO PUT ADDITIONAL CHECKS IN PLACE. TO ENSURE THAT WE MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT. FOR ANYBODY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM. AND ALSO THAT WE HAVE AUDIT FEATURES SO THAT WE CAN COME BACK TO THESE MATTERS FREQUENTLY AND EXAMINE THEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE OPERATING IN A WAY. THAT WE EXPECTED NEED THEM TO BE OPERATING OKAY SO. I ASSUME WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS NOT JUST WHAT HAPPENED BUT ALSO RECKLESS IS GOING FOR TO PREVENT THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING ABSOLUTELY CANCER ABSOLUTELY I DON'T WANT TO BE REVISITING THIS ISSUE I WANT US. NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTIONTHE INSIDE IN MISSIONS AND ALSO WITH THE ATHLETIC SIDE. AND SEE WHERE WE CAN STRENGTHEN THESE PROCESS SEES AND RECAPTURE SOME OF THE FAITH WITH THE PUBLIC THAT WE ARE DOING IT IN FACT WHAT WE SAY WE ARE DOING. THANK YOU AS FAR AS THAT THE LEGACY -- ADMITS YOUR TESTIMONY SAYS THERE ARE THERE ARE NONE -- THERE WERE UP TO THREE DECADES AGO WITH THE REGENT'S HAD THESE -- SPECIAL ADMITS IN LEGACY ADMITS WORK FRANKLY WAS A SPECIAL INTEREST WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS GOT ACCESS TO A BACK DOOR SIDE DOOR WASN'T THE FRONT DOOR AND SO -- WHEN WE -- WENT AWAY WITH -- AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. AND THE HOPE THAT THIS P. S. P. ONE PROCESS AND THEN IN THE NINETIES THAT WENT AWAY BUT THERE STILL ARE THE SPECIAL ADMITS -- BESIDES THESE ATHLETIC SPECIAL ADMITS ARE OTHER OTHER TYPE OF SPECIAL ADMITS WITHIN THE UC AND AND AND WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE NUMBER WE THINK -- YOU SEE WHY THAT THE SPECIAL THAT TRIBUNE A BETTER POSITION TO ANSWER THAT ONCE THE AUDITS ARE UNDERWAY WE WILL BE LOOKING AT ALL EXEMPTIONS WE'LL BE LOOKING AT ALL SPECIAL ADMITS. WILL BE EXAMINING THE PROCEDURES ON THOSE. AND WE WILL BE LOOKING SO WITH THE OPERATION SIDE IN OTHER INDIVIDUALS SAY THAT THERE ARE. NO LEGACY MY JOB IS TO CONFIRM THAT THERE'S NO LIKE SEAT MY JOB IS TO LOOK INTO THOSE AREAS AND MAKE SURE THAT. WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER ISSUES AS A VERIFICATION MATH MECHANISM FOR THE REGION'S I CAN GIVE A LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT INFORMATION ON THAT -- THERE'S A SMALL NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE EXCEPTIONALLY GIFTED -- OUR AND WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL VITALITY TO CAMPUS -- THAT THAT ARE ADMITTED THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND THESE MAY BE GITED MUSICIANS AND GIFTED PERFORMERS IN DIFFERENT FIELDS OF PERFORMANCE OR UP OR AND OR IN THE CASE OF STUDENT ATHLETES -- THE POLICY OF FOR WHAT IS CALLED AT EMISSIONS BY EXCEPTION IS 6% OF ENROLLED STUDENTS. BOB IT HAS BEEN 2% IT IS RARELY EVEN EXCEEDED 2% -- ARE IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN EXOCET WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH ADMISSIONS POLICY FOR FOR A LONG TIME -- OUT BUT BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS -- AND IN INCLUDES THAN INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE HOME SCHOOLED THAT DEBT THAT DON'T HAVE THIS AND THAT DON'T PRESENT THE SAME KIND OF CREDENTIALS AS NON HOME SCHOOL STUDENTS OR THEY COME FROM UNIQUELY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. BUT YET CHAU POTENTIAL TO SUCCEED AT THE UNIVERSITY -- AS ALEX SAID WE POLICY -- AND AND THAT THERE ARE ABUSES ARE AND THAT THE THE WRITE CHECKS AND BALANCES. I ASSUME THAT THE REVIEW WILL INCLUDE NOT JUST THE ATHLETIC SPECIAL ADMITS BUT ALL THE 6%. SPECIAL ADMIT BUT WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT BOTH THE CAMPUS SIDE IN ATHLETICS OKAY HAVE ANY MORE. QUESTIONS ON THE THE INDUSTRY AND THEN ON THE SAT OF BEFORE OPEN UP TO MY TO MY COLLEAGUES -- YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE KINDA SHINES LIGHT ON THIS WHOLE COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF THESE -- COLLEGE ADMISSIONS ADVISORS AND CONSULTANTS AS SOME ARE THAT SAT PREP WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME KAPLAN AND SO FOR SOME. ADVISE STUDENTS AND WHAT COLLEGES ARE VIABLE TO APPLY TO THEM SOME OBVIOUSLY WHAT WENT WELL BEYOND SO I ASSUME -- SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES SELL THEMSELVES TO CONSUMERS BASED UPON THEIR RELATIONSHIP. WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S ADMISSIONS OFFICERS AND SO FORTH SO WHAT TYPE OF STRUCTURE RELATIONSHIP IS THERE WITH THESE WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS THIS INDUSTRY AND THE AND THE UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENTS. I'M AWARE OF NO STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIP -- BETWEEN THOSE INDUSTRIES OKAY BUT AND THAT SECOND QUESTION IS SHOULD THERE BE SHOULD WE HAVE SOME TYPE OF BASIC -- REGISTRY THAT INDIVIDUALS NO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THEY'RE GETTING THEMSELVES INTO AS FAR AS THIS THAT HAS A UNIVERSITY THOUGHT ABOUT -- YOU KNOW HAVING SOME TYPE OF OF OF OF OF THE OFFICIAL SANCTIONING OF THE OF THESE OF THESE -- OF THESE BUSINESSES AND CONSULTANTS OUT THERE. I'M MAKING A NOTE OF THAT. THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE I HI. I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND I'M NOT AWARE OF OTHERS WHO HAVE I THINK THAT'S IT AS SUGGESTION WORTH WORTH EXAMINING. AND THEN -- THE LAST SET OF FIVE QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE TESTING PIECE OF THIS AND SO. A LOT OF DEBATE OF COURSE TONIGHT I HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION AS WELL -- ABOUT THE SAT AND FRANKLY I WAS SOMEWHAT. IN THE SPIRES NOT THE RIGHT WORD BUT IT INTRIGUED ABOUT THIS -- ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN ARE YOU SEE PRESIDENT -- DICK ATKINS AND ASK THIS QUESTION AND AND TALKED ABOUT. THE NEED TO POTENTIALLY GET AWAY FROM FROM THE S. A. T. AND IT GOES BACK TO THE ENROLLMENT DEBATE WE HAD AN HOUR AGO TALKING ABOUT TEST SCORES AND LGBT LOCAL CONTACTS AND ONE THE STRONGEST INDICATORS OF SUCCESS. OUR TEST SCORES BUT HOW YOU DIDN'T HIGH SCHOOL ON YOUR GRADES IN COURSES WHICH HARDER TO CHEAT ON THOSE AND IT IS YOUR SAT AND SPECIFICALLY HOW YOU DID AMONGST YOUR PEERS. WHETHER YOU WANT TO THE TOP SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA LOWEST RANKING SCHOOLS SO I I'M UNDERSTANDING IS UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA ABOUT A YEAR AGO. EMBARKED UPON A A STUDY IN A PROCESS WITH THE FACULTY TO REVIEW. THIS AND TO POTENTIALLY LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF THE S. C. T. S. A. T. -- HOPING THAT YOU COULD GIVE US AN UPDATE ON HOW ON HOW THAT IS PROGRESSING ANY INSIGHT TODAY. THERE ARE THEY ARM AT MEETING ABOUT THOUGH -- ARE MAYBE SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS AGO AT THE PRESIDENT ASK -- THE ACADEMIC SENATE -- TO A TO UNDERTAKE A REVIEW -- OF THE OF THE USE OF EMISSIONS TESTS -- I'M ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO MEET WITH THAT GROUP BUT HI IN A IN A IN A IN A WEEK OR TWO ARE AND GIVE THEM MY INSIGHTS -- CHAIR MCCARTY OUT OF THE I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT THAT I'VE SAWN BOARDS AT THAT TIME. NGUYEN -- THE TESTS WERE WERE ON TO THEM AT LEAST JUST SOME INSIGHTS FROM THAT EXPERIENCE SO -- THEY ARE MEETING -- THEY HAVE BEEN COMPRISED OF OF OF CYCLE PATRICIANS AND ARE INCLUDING TESTS PROPONENTS AND CRITICS -- THE GOAL IS TO APPROACH THIS FROM A TRULY ACADEMIC POINT OF VIEW I I'M LYING TO TO TO READ TO REPORT BACK TO OUR THE PHARMACY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE -- I THINK THE GOAL IS TO ALLOW THAT PROCESS TO TO TAKE WHATEVER TIME THAT THAT THE GOAL IS TO GET IT RIGHT. THEN TO GET A QUICK -- THAT'S WHAT THE THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE -- AS IS IS PROCEEDING WITH BUT I THINK THEY'D BE I I I EXPECT THEM TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY OKAY AND OF COURSE THERE ARE NONE PROS TO THE TEST WHICH UP WHICH I'LL GET TO BUT THAT THE CONS ARE. MY IT IN MINOR SITTING THERE THERE ARE FOR THAT JUMP OUT -- ONE IS THAT -- OVER THE YEARS IT'S BEEN CULTURE ON ROWING JOGGING I THOUGHT ON AS TO YOU KNOW -- ROWING IS TO YOU KNOW WHATEVER IN KIDS MAY NOT KNOW THAT THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO THEY THEY THEY CHANGE THAT A BIT. THE OTHER IS OF COURSE THAT SOME KIDS DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT THAT KAPLAN TEST PREP. AND RESEARCH SHOWS IF YOU. SPOKE ASSIGNED -- SPENDING A TON OF MONEY YOU CAN BECOME A BETTER TEST TAKER TO MAKE MORE INTELLIGENT ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED THE UC -- PROBABLY NOT -- SO THAT'S THE THOSE ARE THE TWO AND THEN THE THE TWO RECENT ONES ARE JUST. YOU KNOW OFF THE CHARTS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW FRAUDULENT AND SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S NO. NO ROOM -- FOR THE YOU KNOW THE ABILITIES AND JUST LIKE YOU CAN ON THE BOARD COURSE MARIJUANA IS NOW LEGAL BUT FIVE YEARS AGO YOU WANTED. THE MARIJUANA YOU GO TO A DOCTOR AND THEY HAD A BAD BACK YOU GOT A NOTE WITHIN OUR YOU WHAT YOU PAID THE FEE AND THERE'S DOCTOR SHOPPING FOR THIS. DISABILITY -- EXEMPTION TO GET MORE TIME AND THEN WHO HAS MONEY TO DO THAT PEOPLE RESOURCES. AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW PAYING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE THE TEST FOR IS THE FOURTH ONE WHICH IS WRONG AND A CRIME AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET -- PUNISHED AS FAR AS THE PROS OF IT -- I KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE. IDEAS TO TO KEEP IT GOING I KNOW -- MISTER O'DONNELL IS TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW BRING THAT INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SET UP SYSTEMS SO KIDS CAN BE TAKING TESTS WENT OUT THIS TEST AND SO. THAT'S AN IDEA IF WE DO KEEP THIS TEST GOING FORWARD I I THINK THAT -- MERIT SICK -- THE WITH THE ONE FOR THE YOU SEE IN THIS IS REALLY REPORT THIS MY LAST QUESTION HERE. BUT BUT I WOULD THINK THAT FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE OVER ARCHING ISSUES IS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS THAT'S A LOT. IT'S A BIG STACK OF PAPER. AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THREE THINGS THAT THE GPA. THE THE TEST SCORES AND THE YOU KNOW THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BASED UPON YOUR ESSAY -- IT IS HARD TO RANK THOSE THE SAT SCORE IN THERE SO IT IS THAT ONE OF THE DRIVING REASONS WHICH KEEPS THE S. A. T. ALIVE IS JUST THE SHEER. VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS THE UC GETS AND HOW IT WOULD JUST REALLY BE A LOGISTICAL HEADACHE TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SORT THESE APPLICATIONS WITHOUT THAT. WELL LET ME SAY ARE BY THE WAY -- WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND APPLICANTS THAT'S EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY APPLICATIONS ACTION CELL SORTING THROUGH THAT IS A CHALLENGE -- AND THE STATE EXPECTS US TO DO THIS IN A WAY -- ARTIST THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING TO DO IT THIS IN A WAY TO HAS ACADEMIC -- AT A INTEGRITY IN VALUE TO IT AND THAT IS AS OBJECTIVE AS POSSIBLE -- TO ARE RECOGNIZING THAT -- THAT THE STAKES OF THOSE DECISIONS ARE QUITE MEANINGFUL AND THAT WE DO HAVE DATA THAT INDICATES THAT ACCESS. TO TO THE UNIVERSITY INCLUDING THE BEST OF THEM. MATTERS -- UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS DOESN'T MATTER AND THE INTEGRITY WITH WHICH THAT. IS HAPPENS MATTERS AND SO TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT CHECK IS ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS -- FOR FOR USING -- THE TEST BUT YOU ALSO ARE OBVIOUSLY QUITE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS -- THERE ARE CULTURAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC FEATURES THAT ARE ALSO LINKED TO THOSE TESTS WE HAVE DATA THAT INDICATES THAT THE SCORES ON THESE TESTS -- ARE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THINGS THAT AREN'T RELATED TO TO ACHIEVE THINGS LIKE OUR OUR STUDENTS FAMILY -- ECONOMIC BACKGROUND THEIR EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND THEIR THEIR RACE -- IS INCREASING IN TERMS OF ITS RELATIONSHIP TO SCORES ON THAT TEST AND I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS WELL. SO THESE THINGS ARE BEING EXAMINED -- THEY ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH -- THIS THE THE THE SCRUTINY THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE STATE EXPECTS THE ACADEMIC SENATE TO TO EXERT. AND AND AND THEN WE'LL GET A REPORT I'LL GET A REPORT AND I EXPECT -- AND THEY EXPECT TO THAT GIVEN GIVEN THE THAT'LL THE LIKELY ATTENTION TO HEAR AT THAT REPORT WILL BE WELL CIRCULATED. OKAY AT THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT THE QUESTION SO FAR YEAH AND IN SOME AT I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WE DON'T KNOW YET. SHEET THE UNIVERSITY -- ORKING WITH THAT SAID AND LOOKING TO CHANCES QUESTIONS FORGET WHAT HAPPENED BUT ALSO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GO FORWARD AND PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS PROCESS. THANK YOU ENTERTAIN OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER O'DONNELL. YES THANK YOU ARE IN EFFECT. YOUR COMMENTS ARE MAKE THE CASE FOR THE S. A. T. TO BE PART OF A HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE OF A WERE PART OF THE HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE LIKE I'M CONTEMPLATING. AND ALONG BEACH UNIFIED IS DOING HOW MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOW ACROSS THE STATE WOULD INSURERS IS THAT THERE'S OVERSIGHT. IF IT'S CONDUCTED AT THE HIGH SCHOOL. THERE'S COMPLIANCE THE EQUITY PROVISIONS ARE FOLLOWED THE ID PEAS. ARE FOLLOWED AND ALSO THAT TEST PREP OCCURS BECAUSE WITH THE S. A. T. AS OPPOSED TO SOME LIKE THE S. BACK AS THAT WHICH IS THAT STATE REQUIRED TESTS. YES PACKED THE ASPECT OF MY PEERS RATHER FLOOD TOOL WITH THE SAT IS MORE OF AN ASSESSMENT SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT YOU GIVE THE THE PSA. AND THE EIGHTH NINTH AND TENTH GRADE THAT'S THE PRETEST RIGHT. AND WHAT YOU CAN THEN DO. IS IDENTIFY THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ATTEMPT TO CLOSE THEM OVER THAT INTERIM PERIOD BEFORE THE FINAL TEST. SO AGAIN I THINK GIVING AT THE HIGH SCHOOL WOULD BE. A MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE TEST CENTERS THERE'S A LACK OF CONTROL THERE THAT KIND OF THING WE KNOW THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT RIGHT NOW THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE HERE -- SO AGAIN I I APPRECIATE THAT CAN MAKES THE CASE THAT IT BE PART OF THE HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE NOW LATER ON MIGHT WE GO TO A DIFFERENT TEST SOME OTHER SOME SOMETHING ELSE PROBABLY. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO JUST SPACE EVERY STUDENT. ON THEIR HIGH SCHOOL ON THEIR HIGH SCHOOL GRADE POINT AVERAGE I THINK IT SHOULD BE MUCH BROADER. THAN THAT BECAUSE STUDENT STUDENTS COME WITH DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES SOME HAVE TO WORK. SOME CAN'T GET THAT FOUR POINT SEVEN GPA RIGHT AND SOME SCHOOLS THE WAY THEIR MODEL MIGHT NOT ALLOW THEM. TO GET THAT FOUR POINT SEVEN GPA SO I THINK WE WE REALLY OUGHT. TO THINK I KNOW WHO WERE NOT YOU KNOW THIS IS A POLITICAL MOMENT WHETHER THIS IS A POLICY QUESTION. BEFORE IS THAT I I THINK WE NEED TO DELVE INTO MUCH MUCH MORE THOROUGHLY. TWENTY CLEAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A ONE TO THREE CASES AT THE UC. REALLY THE PEOPLE THAT OUGHT TO BE UP HERE TODAY ARE FROM SOME OF OUR OTHER NOTED UNIVERSITIES ACROSS OUR STATE ACROSS OUR NATION. OKAY IT IS NOT LIKE THIS IS THE THE UC HAS BEEN THE BIG ACTOR. IN THIS SITUATION ALTHOUGH YOU'RE LOOKING INTO A NICE AND YOUR YOUR AUDIT I GUESS IS YOUR FORMAL INVESTIGATION IS THAT TRUE. THERE WILL BE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE INDIVIDUAL -- INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED AS WELL AS A SERIES OF AUDITS THAT WERE IN THOSE THOSE WILL THOSE WILL BE YOUR INVESTIGATION YES. THAT THAT AUDIT IS YOUR INVESTIGATION WILL DO AGAIN THEY'LL BE INVESTIGATIONS AS TOO SO. THE KNOWN INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN. THOSE MATTERS WILL BE INVESTIGATED. BUT ON TOP OF THAT. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE SYSTEMS WILL BE LOOKING AT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES WILL BE LOOKING AT STRUCTURALLY HOW TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS SEES. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN. RAISE OUR RAISE THE BAR ON OUR ADMISSIONS PROCESS AND AND MAKE STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL. FOR CLOSE PEOPLE FROM TO ENTER THAT RELATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SIDE DOORS INTO THE UNIVERSE YES. TO TAKE YOU YOU'RE BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE SEEKING TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY THAT'S RIGHT HAVE YOUR ADMISSIONS PROCESS. WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD THING AND I KNOW EVERYBODY -- STANDS FOR THE SAME THING TO BUT AGAIN I JUST CAN'T HIGHLIGHTED ENOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER. UNIVERSITIES MISTER CHAIR THAT OUGHT TO BE SITTING UP HERE RIGHT NOW THOSE UNIVERSITIES MANY OF THEM PROBABLY GET CAL GRANT DOLLARS. RIGHT SO THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO A GOING FORWARD WE WE WILL LOOK BURKE WROTE HAVE ANOTHER JOINT HEARING BUT TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA BUDGET. OR TIME A LOT MORE THAN THAT HERE YEAH WE THOUGHT WE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT OTHER UNIVERSITIES. TO WHICH WE CAN ANTI WITHOUT YOUR THEY'RE NOT HERE RIGHT SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IT WILL IDENTITY I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OUGHT TO BE PROJECT FOR THEM THAT DON'T I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. WE NEED TO DRAG A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND ASK THEM QUESTIONS. THANK YOU [inaudible] MR TING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS -- APPRECIATE UC'S VERY FORCEFUL STATEMENT ABOUT THIS REALLY A PORT ISSUE -- YOU YOU ALL KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THE INTEGRITY OF THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS IS TO EVERY UNIVERSITY IT'S IT'S THE VALUE OF THE DEGREE. IT IS THE VALUE OF THE INSTITUTION FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT PROCESS IS SOLID IN ANY PARTICULAR WAY COMPLETE TO VALUE. THE INSTITUTION BUT THE VALUES THE AGREED IN VALUES THE ENTIRE. EXPERIENCE AS THE SON OF IMMIGRANTS YOU KNOW I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT WE HAD TO WORK HARD BUT THAT IF WE WORKED HARD WE STUDIED HARD WE COULD WE COULD GET IT. AND I THINK THAT -- THIS IS SENDING THE COMPLETELY OPPOSITE MESSAGE THAT OBVIOUSLY -- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR VERY STRONG STATEMENT ON I IN FACT I WANT TO COMMEND YOU SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE BECAUSE ON ONE OF THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINTS ABOUT. YOU SEE WHETHER IT'S BERKELEY OR UCLA OR ANY OF THAT ANY OF THE UNIVERSITY IS HOW. DIFFICULT IT IS FOR DONORS TO GET THEIR KIDS INTO THOSE COLLEGES. I AND I KNOW SORT OF LIKE A A RUNNING JOKE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU HEAR ABOUT FROM THE VARIOUS PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS I BELIEVE MISTER -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH IS SORT OF REFERRING. TO IS A REALLY APPLAUD THE UNIVERSITY UP FOR THAT I KNOW IT'S CHALLENGING AT TIMES WERE WE WE JUST HAD A VERY. LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT ENROLLMENT AND HOW COMPETITIVE ENROLLMENT IS AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET IN AND I KNOW THAT IT'S EASY. TO LOOK AT BENDING THOSE -- THOSE RULES THAT APPLY TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR REALLY NOT GOING DOWN THAT PATH AND AND NOT BENDING THOSE RULES REALLY -- STAYING BY A VERY STRINGENT -- VERY CHALLENGING ADMISSIONS ENROLLMENT PROCESS ON MY AND MY QUESTION IS TO GO BACK TO JUST THE CATEGORY -- THAT THE CHAIR WAS TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS. WHAT HOW HOW DO YOU CALL THAT CATEGORY WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE IT WAS CALLED SPECIAL ACTION? BUT WHAT WHAT'S IT CALLED NOW IN A MISSION BY EXCEPTION ADMISSION BY ACCEPTING COULD CAUSE SO COULD YOU WALK THE COMMITTEE THROUGH HOW. HOW THAT EXCEPTION IS IS DONE? HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE TRADITIONAL ENROLLMENT -- DIGNITY MISSIONS PROCESS WHERE YOU LOOK AT THE GRADES TEST SCORES READ THE ESSAYS AND THEN. THERE THERE'S SOME SCORE IN THIS MARKET SEGMENT I DID BRING ACTUALLY DID DIRECTOR OF OF ADMISSION WONDERFUL GO TO DETAILS -- DOCTOR HARM ME IAN WILL BUT YOU WANT MORE DETAIL AND SHE SHE CAN TELL. HI GOOD AFTERNOON OR IT'S THE MORNING I SUPPOSE -- SO ADMISSION BY EXCEPTION IS TO USE FOR STUDENTS WHO DON'T MEET OUR MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION SO ON THE SCHOLARSHIP SIDE SO WHETHER THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE RIGHT SAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE S. A. T.. ON ITS OWN AND THEN THERE'S THE OPTIONAL ESSAY WHICH WE REQUIRE AS PART OF THEIR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS FOR FRESHMAN ADMISSION -- THAT TAKING THE FIFTEEN A THREE G. WE FIND THAT STUDENTS -- MAY NOT DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY GO TO SCHOOL MAY NOT HAVE A FULL. ACCESS TO ALL THE A THROUGH G. ESPECIALLY SOMETIMES IN THE AREAS OF THE VISUAL AND PERFORMING ARTS REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE. STUDENTS WHO ARE HOME SCHOOLED AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIERSO ANYONE WHO IS -- A CAMPUS IS WANTING TO ADMIT -- BUT DOESN'T QUITE MEET EVERY SEE CAN'T CHECK OFF EVERY BOX FOR OUR MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS WOULD THEN BE SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW -- TO AND WHETHER TO COMMITTEE OR OF OR SOME OTHER REVIEW BODY DEPENDING ON THE CAMPUS IS THEN LOOKING TO SEE -- WHETHER THEY HAVE IN OUR WHOLE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW. IT IS MORE THAN THE THREE I MENTIONED EARLIER GPA TEST SCORES AND THE RESPONSES TO WHAT WE CALL THE PERSONAL INSIGHT QUESTIONS BUT FOURTEEN CRITERIA ACTUALLY WHETHER IT'S SPECIAL TALENTS OUR WHETHER THEY'RE COMING FROM A RURAL AREA A PLACE WHERE -- WE ARE TRYING. TO BRING MORE STUDENTS IN FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OR A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN ADMISSIONS IF THEY MEET ALL OF THOSE AND THE CAMPUS DOESN'T WANT TO OFFER. A PLACE ON THE CAMPUS THEN THAT STUDENT WOULD BE LABELED OR PROVIDED ADMISSION BY EXCEPTION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T MEET THAT MINIMUM CRITERIA. SO SO SO SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THE MAJOR CATEGORIES THAT WOULD WOULD QUALIFY FOR ADMISSIONS BY EXCEPTION OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT TRADITIONALLY YOU SEE ELIGIBLE. THAT SUCH SUITS ARE NOT TRADITIONALLY USED ELIGIBLE WHO MAYBE ATHLETES MAY BE HOME SCHOOLED. ME REPRESENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY HAS BEEN A MONTH MUCH OF THAT. CONCENTRATION MISSIONS HAPPENS IN THE URBAN OR THOUGHT OR THAT MORE COASTAL PART OF THE STATE. SO IS THAT CORRECT IS THAT FAIR I DO DONORS OR ALUMNI ARE AS AS AT A CATEGORY WITHIN THAT ADMISSIONS BY EXCEPTION. NO IT IS NOT WE HAVE. TO SO THE HEAD OF THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS CAN'T. CAN'T CALL YOU OR CALL THE DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES AND SAY HEY WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THESE FABULOUS. BOOSTERS AND ALUMNI IN THE SYSTEM THIS IS THAT THIS IS SOMEONE THAT WE NEED YOU TO ADMIT BY EXCEPTION. ALL THEY CAN DO THAT BUT WE WOULD NOT ADMIT ANYONE IF THEY DONATED BUILDING OR WHAT IF THEY YOU KNOW AND OUR CHAIR. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT DOESN'T OCCUR. IN -- HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT THIS ADMISSIONS THAT YOUR POLICIES AT THE? LEVEL IS BEING IMPLEMENTED AT EACH OF THE TEN CAMPUS. HOW DO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU WISH TO ASSURE THAT IS CURRENT YEAH AT THIS TIME I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT -- AS PROPOSED BROWN HAD MENTIONED THAT THE POLICY DOES ALLOW FOR UP 26% OF THE ENROLLED CLASS AND OUR CAMPUSES ARE SHOWING THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY ADMITTING IN ROLLING FAR LESS THAN -- THAT CLOSER 2122% DEPENDING ON THE CAMPUS AND THE AUDIT THAT WILL BE UNDERGONE WALSH. HOPEFULLY -- WHY IS IT WHY IS IT SO LOW I MEAN YOU YOU THAT THIS IS A KID THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE CAMPUSES HAVE -- SURMOUNT DISCRETION WHY IS IT ONLY 2% YOU THINK VERSUS SIX BECAUSE THE DEMAND FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ARE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE IS SO HIGH. SO SO YOU COULD BASICALLY FILL UP YOUR ENTIRE CLASS WITH -- ALL YOU SEE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS SO IT'S YOU KNOW YOU REALLY HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING FAIRLY EXTRAORDINARY TO BE ADMITTED BY EXCEPTION ACT. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SO -- GOING TO CALL BACK TO MISTER BUSTAMANTE IN TERMS OF YOUR AUDIT CAN YOU CAN JUST KIND OF THE GIVE US THE THE SCOPE HOW HOW BROAD THAT ON IT WILL TERMS OF UNDERGRADUATE MISSIONS OR ARE YOU ALSO INCLUDING UCSF AS PART OF THIS. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT ALL THE CAMPUSES I WILL BE LOOKING AT BOTH THE CAMPUS SIDE AS WELL AS THE ATHLETIC SIDE TO EXAMINE WHAT THE PROCESSES ARE. WILL BE IS PROBABLY TO WEAR RIGHT NOW -- DESIGNING DESIGNING THE AUDIT AND WHAT OUR APPROACH IS GOING TO BE. FOR MAPPING OUT THE EXISTING PROCESS SEASON LOOKING AT THE POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS THE OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY THE HIGH RISK AREAS. CLEARLY THE EXCEPTION AREA WOULD BE ONE THAT WE WITH A FOCUS IN ON BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE IDENTIFY ANYTHING ELSE AS WE MAP OUT THE PROCESS SEES IT EACH OF THE CAMPUSES. WE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FIND OTHER AREAS THAT WE THINK ARE WORTHY OF AUDIT. AND AS THE INDEPENDENT A FORM. OF FOR THE REGION'S IMAGE AND IN THE CAPACITY TO VERIFY WHAT IS ACTUALLY UNDERGOING. WE WILL LOOK AT THE HERE THE OPERATION SIDE AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY PERFORM SOME OF THOSE SPOT CHECKS. TO SEE IF THOSE BEING DONE IN THE WAY AS DESCRIBED IN INTENDED BY POLICY. THE WILL NOT BE CONFINING OUR ANALYSIS TO JUST THAT SO IF WE SEE THINGS THAT COME UP. WE WILL BE -- DRILLING DOWN ON THOSE ACCORDINGLY -- AND THAT WOULD YOU DESPITE THOSE WHEN WE MATH OUT THE EXISTING PROCESS SEES IDENTIFY POTENTIAL STRUCTURAL ISSUES FOR OTHER ISSUES THAT -- MAY PERCENT SOME MANAGEMENT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS. I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT'LL BE DONE IN THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHSGREAT. AND MIKE MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM LONG BEACH SORT OF ALLUDED TO THIS BUT IF -- IF IF IT. NHIáU YOUR INSTITUTIONS THAT RECEIVE CAL GRANT. WERE FORBIDDEN TO GIVE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT -- TO DONORS AND ALUMNI THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT DOESN'T IT WOULD NOT IMPACT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IS OUT OF IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT -- AND THEN -- JUST JUST LAST I'M JUST AGAIN URGE IS IT SEEMS LIKE -- AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARE PURPOSELY VERY THOUGHTFULLY HAS KEPT THIS CATEGORY EXTRAORDINARILY SMALL GIVEN THE EVEN EVEN DESPITE THE HUGE DEMAND FOR ACCESS TO TO ALL YOUR ELITE INSTITUTIONS. A REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO STAY THE COURSE APPRECIATE THE VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION -- I GUESS SORRY MY LAST QUESTION -- I FORGOT TO ASK EARLIER IS -- IN REGARDS TO THE THERE ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED FOR RECEIVED IT TOO GREEDY -- UNDER THESE FALSE PRETENSES WHAT IS THE ACTION THAT WILL BE TAKEN -- WE'LL WE'LL HAVE TO REVIEW THAT ARE. THIS IS THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT -- WOULD BE ENGAGE OUR WITH THAT WITH THE CHANCES AND THE ACADEMIC SENATE ON THOSE ISSUES -- WE'RE WE'RE STILL KIND OF AS IN AIDING TO THE PROPER -- WHEN WE IDENTIFY BUT WE HAVE TO ANTICIPATE WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT AND I CAN TELL YOU AT LEAST RIGHT NOW? MOUTH ABOUT ABOUT THAT KIND OF SITUATION SO. SO AT SIZE A AS A FORMER BERKELEY LET MY HATE TO EVER YOU STANFORD AS AN EXAMPLE -- I'M I'M GONNA GO THERE TODAY BECAUSE IN CONVERSATION -- ROLE -- IT'LL A CONVERSATION I I COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETHING. SIMILAR HAD JUST HAD A AND A STANFORD -- TO STAND FOR STUDENTS AND THAT AGAIN THE THE WORD MINUTE UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. ON THAT THEIR DEGREE WAS REVOKED AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE APPROPRIATE ACTION FOR ANYBODY WHO'S COMPLETED THEIR DEGREE AND I WOULD REALLY URGE. THE THE UNIVERSITY TO EXPEL THE CURRENT STUDENTS WHO ARE. CURRENTLY IN ENROLLMENT AND AS WELL AS TO RESCIND THE DEGREES I THINK -- I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT DECISION COMES VERY SWIFTLY AND VERY QUICKLY. SO THAT THERE CAN BE A VERY STRONG DISINCENTIVE BIT BECAUSE AGAIN. IF IF YOU CAN CHEAT THE SYSTEM AND GET YOUR DEGREE. NO ONE'S GONNA NO ONE'S GONNA KNOW ON THEIR RESUME THAT THIS DEGREES. NOT VALID OR THAT THE GREEDY -- FOR WHATEVER REASON THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR PARENTS WERE. SORT OF INDICATED IN THIS SCANDAL LESS THEY THEY DO SOME DEEPER RESEARCH I THINK THE UNIVERSITY HAS TO TAKE SOME EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG ACTION. ON TO EXPEL EXPELLED THE STUDENTS TO ROUTE YOU KNOW TAKE BACK THOSE DEGREES BECAUSE OTHERWISE -- WHAT'S WHAT IS THE DISINCENTIVE FOR DOING THIS CHEATING FRAUD DECEIT SHOULD NOT BE REWARDED ABSOLUTE AND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER THAT ALL THE CAMPUSES ARE HARMONIZED TURNED TO HOW THEY DO. SO SO HOUSE HOW SOON CAN WE EXPECT SOME SORT OF ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH WITH THE STUDENTS THAT WE DO ARE AWARE OF WELL I'M A PART OF PART OF IT. IT DEPENDS ON A LOT OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE WE DO KNOW THAT THE CAMPUS IS THEMSELVES. INDEPENDENT OF WHAT ALEX'S. THE CAMPUS IS THEMSELVES ARE DOING THEIR OWN -- REFUSE -- TO AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL BE ON COVER -- OUR AND SO RIGHT NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. AND YOUR QUESTION ACTUALLY SUGGESTS THIS THAT WE ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE WHAT WE MIGHT FINE. AND THEN I AND ANY WE MAY NOT FIND BUT IF WE DO WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF THAT BUT YOU HAVE A THE STUDENT A GRADUATE FROM BERKELEY THE EXACT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO SEE SO YOU DO HAVE. THREE INDIVIDUALS I DON'T KNOW THE NATURE OF THE WRONGDOING ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS I NOTE THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED I KNOW THEY ARE SUBJECT. TO TO INVESTIGATE OF PROCESS THESE -- AND SO IT'S IT'S HARD TO ADDRESS THOSE INDIVIDUALS BUT WHAT WE CAN DO. AS OUR ADDRESS LISTED CIRCUMSTANCE OF IF IT WERE TO BE FOUND THAT SUCH INDIVIDUALS WHETHER IT'S THEM AS SOMEBODY -- GOT THEIR DEGREE THROUGH FROST -- INFORMATION WHAT IS OUR RESPONSE SEP SO HOW SOON DO YOU ANTICIPATE FINISHING THIS INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE THREE STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE PRESS. I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABLES RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'VE REACHED REACHING OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE NAPPY I TRY TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SURE PROBABLY WHERE SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT -- IS GERMANE TO THESE ISSUES ARE OUTSIDE OF THE UNIVERSITY'S CONTROL TO TRYING TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND TRYING. IMPORTANTLY TO FIND IF THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON IS A PRIORITY OF MINE. SO UNTIL I'M ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET. AND WE COOPERATE WITH THE THE THE FOR PROCRASTINATION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I'M GOING TO BE THIS COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GIVE YOU WELL IT'S A HOPE BROUGHT THE TO HAVE THIS AT LEAST HAVE SOME RESOLUTION THE NEXT FEW MONTHS OR DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE LONGER THAN THAT. THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR MY OFFICE THIS IS -- I'LL BE HANDLING THE INVESTIGATION TO SUPERVISION OF THEM PERSONALLY SO THIS IS A PRIORITY MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY SO I WANT TO GET THIS DONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT YOU STATED. I ALSO WANT TO IDENTIFY IF THERE ARE OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'D LOOK AT FOR IT AGAIN THE REASON SUGGESTED AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN. GET TO THE BOTTOM THIS AND HAVE AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE HAVE THAT DISINCENTIVE ISIS PEOPLE FOR TAKING THIS TACTIC. SO SO WE I MEAN WE HAVE A BUDGET DEADLINE JUNE FIFTEENTH DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT YOU'LL BE DONE WITH YOUR INVESTIGATION BY THEN. I BE AGAIN RE MISTER I BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GIVE AN ANSWER BUT I'M HAPPY TO COME BACK AND GIVE UPDATES I'D BE HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ALONG THE WAY AS WE GO AS APPROPRIATE -- BUT RIGHT NOW TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET FROM YOU A HEART STOP AND SEE WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE COMPLETED THERE'S TOO MANY VARIABLES OUTSIDE OF MY CONTROL. APPRECIATE JUST URGE -- IN A U. G. SECTION OF OUR PARTY REALLY HOPE THAT GETS TREATED TREATED AS SUCH AND THAT THESE. YOU KNOW THREE INDIVIDUALS ARE RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY GET GET YOU KNOW ON OTHER EXONERATED OR BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. THE SECOND. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER MEDINA AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. I WANT TO SAY THAT AS A PARENT AS A TEACHER I THINK -- REGULAR HARD WORKING PEOPLE. HAVE PERHAPS A NAIVE BELIEF. THAT THE SYSTEM WE CAN CALL IT THAT WILL TREAT THEM FAIRLY THANKS. FOR BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE WITH PARENTS WHO HAVE -- EXCEEDINGLY MORE AMOUNT OF MONEY RESOURCES -- EVEN TIME. ARE ABLE TO MANEUVER THE SYSTEM. LOOK FOR THE VULNERABLE ABILITIES OF THAT SYSTEM. AND AND LEVERAGE THEIR POWER. IN A WAY THAT IS COMPLETELY -- INEQUITABLE WITH THE IDEA I THINK WHAT EVERYONE EXPECTS. AND I THINK THE CHAIRMAN MCCARTY THE FROM THE OUTSET WAS ABLE TO PINPOINT ONE VULNERABILITY. AND THAT WAS THE ONE WITH THE SPORTS AND I THINK THAT WAS VERY CLEAR IN THE NEWS STORIES. THAT JUST BY SAYING YOU KNOW MY SON MY DAUGHTER -- IS A ROLL OR IS A WATER PULL AND THEN PROVIDE THE PICTURE -- THAT THE SOCCER COACH AT UCLA WAS ABLE JUST BY HIMSELF -- TO ADMIT THAT STUDENT SO. FOLKS WITH SO MUCH MONEY SO MUCH TIME. ABLE TO LOOK -- FOR YOU KNOW WHERE OF THOSE POINTS WHERE THOSE POINTS WHERE THEY CAN -- CHEAT -- ANSWER TO GAME THE SYSTEM BUT I THINK THAT THAT SPORTS -- EXAMPLE IS WHEN THAT SHOULD BE EASILY FIXED. RIGHT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE NO ONE WAS LOOKING TO SEE A TO FOLLOW UP -- WAS THAT -- YOUNG MAN YOUNG. WOMAN ACTUALLY PLANE AFTER THEY'D BEEN ACCEPTED. EVEN SOMETIMES WITHOUT EVEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE KIDS THEMSELVES FOR RIDE THE THE YOUNG PERSON AT USC WHO WAS ADMITTED IN THE COUNSELOR ASTON -- IF THE I I UNDERSTAND YOU DO WELL IN TRACK AND THE YOUNG MAN EXT YOU KNOW RESPONDED NO I DON'T RUN TRACK -- SO THAT THAT SHOULD BE EASILY FIXED WITH MORE -- SUPERVISION -- BUT AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO A SYSTEM THAT PERHAPS IS BROKEN OF THAT. I I THINK ONE REDEEMING THING IS IS -- PRO WAS BROWN POINTED OUT THE NEWS STORIES THAT HAVE COME OUT SINCE THEN OF ALL THOSE HARD WORKING KIDS. OTHERS HARDWORKING KIDS WHO COME FROM SCHOOLS OF LESSER MEANS. OF WHO DON'T HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGES THAT THESE OTHER FOLKS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TO USE. CONTINUE CONTINUE TO WORK HARD CONTINUE TO DO WHAT YOU KNOW WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO. AND HOPEFULLY MOVING FORWARD WE CAN FIND A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT. A SO EASILY -- GAME. AND SO THAT THAT. YOU KNOW MAYBE I CONTINUE IN MY NAIVE HOPE THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE SO MANY RESOURCES -- WON'T HAVE SO MANY MORE ADVANTAGES IN ACCESSING WHAT WE SAY IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS IN THIS COUNTRY. AS MISTER CHANG I THINK ALLUDED TO A COMING FROM F. EMIGRANT PARENTS YOU KNOW THERE ARE. IF PERHAPS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO CAME YOU KNOW WITH THE BELIEVE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY YOU CAN PROGRESS BE BY YOUR OWN MERIT BY YOUR OWN HARD WORK. I THINK IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WE'VE HAD. LOOKING AT THE DISCUSSION AGAIN ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. AND I I WOULD SAY EVEN AT THE POINT WHERE I WAS ADMITTED TO COLLEGE. GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND PEOPLE POINTING TO JOSE MEDINA. PERHAPS GOD AND IT UNFAIR ADVANTAGE BECAUSE HIS NAME WAS JOSE MEDINA. AND THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T BELONG. IN THAT INSTITUTION BECAUSE IT YOUR SKIN. WERE THAT WE WEREN'T CAPABLE OF DOING THE WORK THE ACADEMIC WORK WELL WE'VE SORT OF NOW TURNED IT. UPSIDE DOWN. YOU KNOW AND NOW WE ARE SEEING THOSE WITH SO MUCH INFLUENCE SO MUCH. BEING THE FOLKS WHO ARE BEING AN ADMITTEDLY. WRONG ADMITTED INTO UNIVERSITIES FOR THE WRONG REASONS. AND MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK BACK. AT THOSE POLICIES THAT ALLOWED. MORE PEOPLE FROM UNREPRESENTED MINORITIESUNREPRESENTED POPULATIONS TO BE THERE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO CONTINUE TO WORK HARD. EVERY DAY DO WHAT WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO WITH NOT THE BENEFIT OF SAT PREP SAYS. SOMEONE TO HELP THEM RIGHT THERE SA. WITH NO BEAU TEA -- COUNSELING SERVICE BUT HAVE TO RELY ON THEIR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR WHO LOOKS AT FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND HAS MAYBE TWICE. TWO TIMES IN THE YEAR A MEETING WITH THAT STUDENT. AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO GET ADVICE. FROM YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS DON'T HAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PAY. SO I HOPE THAT PERHAPS. WE CAN USE WHAT IS HAPPENED HERE TO RE LOOK AT THE SYSTEM THAT WE USE TO EVALUATE OUR STUDENTS. AND I CAN ONLY HOPE BECAUSE WITHOUT IT. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF VERY -- DISSATISFIED AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE WHITE WHY SHOULD YOU WORK HARD IF THE ONLY WAY. TO TO MOVE FORWARD IS BY. DOING SOMETHING THAT IS IS NOT RIGHT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER SOMEONE MEMBER LIMóN THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. I ALSO -- REFLECT A LOT ON MY EXPERIENCE AND PARTNERING WITH ADMISSIONS OFFICE AND I WANT TO ACTUALLY START OFF BY THINKING EVERY SINGLE ADMISSIONS OFFICER OUT THERE. BECAUSE WHAT IS NOT ALSO BEING INCLUDING THIS CONVERSATION IS HOW MANY DISCREPANCIES THEY DO CATCH AHEAD OF THE GAME -- ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WERE AND I KNOW THE COUNTLESS HOURS THEY SPEND REVIEWING THOSE APPLICATIONS TO TRY TO CATCH IN DISCREPANCIES THINGS THAT DON'T MATCH WITH. TRANSCRIPTS WITH RECORDS AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS MAINTAINS ITS INTEGRITY I THINK -- AS I'VE HEARD DESCRIBED THAT THERE IS -- MULTIPLE PROCESSES FOR ADMISSIONS. MY CONCERN IS NOT SO MUCH AT WITH THE EXCEPTIONAL EGGMAN MISSIONS TO EXCEPTION BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL REQUIRED TO BE TRUTHFUL. IN THAT PROCESS -- AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT GREAT I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE REALITY OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE CHOICE THAT'S OUT THERE -- SO I I HOPE THAT TO ADD. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE I DO WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THAT OF THE LIMITED INFORMATION WE KNOW SAYS FAR -- IT IS NOT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS -- THAT RAISE THE GREATEST CONCERN AT THE MOMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS OUR PRIVATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS -- AND I A I WELCOME THE CONVERSATION IN THE HEARINGS THAT WILL COME FORWARD. AND THERE'S ALSO A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. IN OUR STATE THAT HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY IN ADDITION -- TO THE ADMISSIONS OFFICERS OF EVERY SINGLE CAMPUS AND THOSE ARE OUR STUDENTS. I CAME FROM STUDENT IN THE THAT'S WHERE I GOT MY FEET WET WITH ORGANIZING. AND TO THINK OF EVERY PERSON OUT THERE THAT BENEFITTED FROM FREE VOLUNTEER SERVICES ON HOW TO BEAT THE BEEF UP. AN APPLICATION WHERE TO GET SCHOLARSHIPS FOR OR WAIVERS OF SORTS FOR THE SAT AND ACT EASE WHO VOLUNTEERED TO READ ADMISSIONS ESSAYS AND EDIT THEM TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK. I THINK IS ANOTHER EQUATION TO THE STORY AND IT'S BASED ON ONE OF I BELIEVE OUR STATE IN COUNTRIES FUNDAMENTAL VALUES THAT EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL SHOT AND WILL HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO IT. SO I HOPE THAT. WE WILL MAINTAIN THOSE IT SOUNDS FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID THAT WE WILL I THINK YOU DO THE UC FOR NOT BEING SCARED TO ADDRESS IT FOR BEING THE FIRST TO BE UP FRONT -- WE KNOW IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE THAT -- WHEN ONE PERSON VIOLATES A POLICY OR A LIGHT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE -- AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE SAME -- FOR THE UC -- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY OUTCOMES THAT. THE REPORT HAS SIMPLY TO LEARN. TO LEARN IF THERE'S FLAWS THAT CAN BE ADDRESS REALLY BE A ONE PERSON DID SOMETHING WRONG SITUATION BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW THAT AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER. YES -- I AND I THINK THISTEAM HAS BEEN HIT A LOT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY AT RISK HERE IS YOU KNOW. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE MORE RESOURCES INTO THIS THAT THAT THE WEALTHY YOU KNOW. HAVE ACCESS TO YOU KNOW MORE RESOURCE OPPORTUNITIES MAYBE OF HIRING SOMEONE TO HELP THEM. HE GET INTO SCHOOL THAT SOME DISTRICTS ARE WEALTHIER SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE WEALTHIER THAN OTHERS -- BUT WHAT'S AT RISK HERE IS IT AT THE UC ADMISSIONS LEVEL IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABOUT MERITOCRACY YOU KNOW THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU CAME FROM. NO MATTER WHAT. YOU KNOW DISADVANTAGES YOU MIGHT HAVE YOU'VE GOT A SHOT. TO GET INTO THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO CAME FROM A VERY RURAL AREA WHO DIDN'T COME FROM A WEALTHY SCHOOL DISTRICT. HERE WHO IS A SECOND GENERATION -- YOU KNOW CALL JOB CAN'T BUT COULD MAKE THAT. YOU KNOW AND GET INTO ONE OF THE TOP SCHOOLS OF AND I KNOW THAT'S THE CASE FOR SO MANY OF MY FELLOW STUDENTS WHO WENT THROUGH THERE THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY WAS THERE. AND THIS IS UNDERMINED AS MY COLLEAGUE JOSE MEDINA JUST POINTED OUT -- WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE? THAT MONEY COULD HAVE PLAYED THE FACTOR THAT WEALTH ACTUALLY DID IMPACT. OF THAT DECISION AT THE ADMISSIONS LEVEL. YOU KNOW -- AND SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE WHAT I'VE HEARD A LOT OF IS NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE OR NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE OR WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY OF THAT HAPPENING BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT PROCEDURES DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE. SO WHEN YOU SAY WE DON'T KNOW THAT A DONOR. A DONATION TO THE UNIVERSITY DID AFFECTED IMPACT DECISION. WHAT PROCEDURE DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE FOR EXAMPLE TO TRACK A DONATION? LET'S MADE FROM ALUMNI OR FROM THE FROM A FAMILY DONOR AND TO MAKE SURE THAT'S NOT INFLUENCE SCENE. THE ADMISSION. OF MAYBE SOMEONE THAT'S RELATED TO THEM OR SOMEONE THAT IS THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER. WHAT WHAT WHAT PROCEDURES DO WE HAVE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN? ARE ACTUALLY ARE. I I WILL BE DEFERRED TO MY MY COLLEAGUE WHO RUNS A MISSION BUT I DO WANT TO SAY I HAVEN'T CHAIRED -- THE LOCAL CAMPUS THE MISSION IT USEDTO BE AN ONGOING FRUSTRATION THAT -- THAT THAT FOLKS OF BEINGS COULD NOT GET. COULD NOT PENETRATE. REVISIONS OFFICE AND BE ABLE TO TALK TO ADMISSIONS PERSONNEL THAT MAKE ADMISSIONS DECISIONS WE ACTUALLY TRY TO PROTECT THAT PROCESS. FROM EXTERNAL OF FORCES -- AND AND AND AND THE PRESSURES OF EMIGRATE BECAUSE ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS SO PRECIOUS BUT IT'S ALSO VERY PURCHASE THAT THAT PROCESS BE VERY WELL PROTECTED. SO THAT EVERYBODY HASFAITH IN THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE PROCEDURES THAT'S HOW AND BECAUSE WE CAN ALL SAY -- IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS PRECIOUS AND ALL THAT BUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO NOW. ANSWER WE THAT IS ONE OF THINGS AND I'LL BE RESPONSIBLE LOOKING AT IS EXAMINING THE PROCEDURES. FOR OF MANY OF MORE WHAT DO YOU HAVE TODAY THOUGH I MEAN. I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO EXAMINE IT BUT YOU SHOULD BE A THIS IS WE HAVE FACULTY THAT ACTUALLY REVIEW. THE ADMISSIONS PROCESSES AND HOW THEIR CONDUCT -- THAT'S ONGOING THOSE COMMITTEES MEET. REGULARLY -- WE HAVE A PROCESS WHERE -- TO ASK ME I WANT TO SAY THAT WE WANT THE IF I DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT TO PREJUDICE THE INVESTIGATION -- BUT I WANT TO SAY -- THAT OUT WE MAKE SURE THAT FOR MOST OF OUR PROCESSES AND ALL THE PRICES THAT I KNOW ABOUT AND I HAVE BEEN KNEE DEEP IN ADMISSIONS. NO INDIVIDUAL NO SINGLE INDIVIDUAL IS ABLE TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON THE DECISION THAT GOES THROUGH VETTING INTERNAL TO THE TO THE ODD TO THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE -- AND THAT PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT I COULD TELL YOU THAT I'VE TALKED TO THE INDIVIDUAL CHANCELLOR'S WHO ACTUALLY BY POLICY HAVE A ROLE WITH RESPECT IT MATCHES BY EXCEPTION. TO A PERSON THEY SAID WE DON'T ACTUALLY REACHED. HI HAD COME OUT YOU ABOUT -- BUT WE WANT THE PROCESS TO REVEAL BOTH -- WHERE IT'S WORKING WELL WHERE THEY MIGHT BE VULNERABILITIES AND WHERE IT MAY NOT BE WORKING WELL WE DON'T WANT TO PREACH THE -- PRESUPPOSE THAT WE DON'T FIND SOME WARTS AND FLAWS AND WE WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT BACK. TO RIGHT. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I CAN TELL YOU BUT I CAN TELL YOU SYSTEM WIDE -- THE ADMISSIONS DIRECTORS AND THE THE FACULTY WHO CHAIR THOSE LOW CAMPUSES COMMITTEES MEET REGULARLY TO REVIEW -- POLICIES AND POLICY COMPLIANCE -- AND THEY HAVE TO GIVE ACCOUNT NOT ONLY TO THE PRESIDENT BUT ULTIMATELY TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS AS WELL -- FOR THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PROCESS IS SO WE ALL HAVE A STATE THAT THIS IS RUN WELL. GOOD YOU WERE GONNA SO SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT WHAT WE DO HAVE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL TALENT WHETHER IT BE ATHLETICS OR IN THE VISUAL PERFORMING ARTS AREA THEATERS AND SUCH -- THERE'S A PROCESS FOR FACULTY OR IN THIS AT FOR ATHLETICS COACHES TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADMISSIONS FOR THE STUDENTS THERE IS NO PROCESS FOR THE ALUMNI OFFICE OR DEVELOPMENT OFFICE TO MAKE ANY SORT OF RECOMMENDATION. OKAY ABOUT ONE LET'S GO TO THAT ON SPORTS I MEAN IS THERE ANY PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY CHECKS. WE'RE SAYING HEY THIS IS A PERSON. YOU KNOW THAT'S AN ATHLETE IS GONNA ADD DOES ANYBODY CHECK TO ACTUALLY SEE IF THAT PERSON'S ACTUALLY PLAYING THE SPORT AT THE HIGH SCHOOL -- THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE COMING FROM. WELL I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT ALEX WILL BE UNDERTAKING BUT THE ADMISSIONS OFFICERS RELATE RELY ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE EXPERTS. WHETHER IT'S FOR US AS SOON AS CASE THE CODE. RIGHT OKAY WELL THAT'S A PROBLEM. THAT'S A PROBLEM IT MAY BE. WELL I MEAN THAT'S NOT I MEAN I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA DO AN INVESTIGATION WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT BUT AT THE SAME TOKEN. YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS STUFF RIGHT SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL ME WHAT YOU DO DO. RIGHT NOW TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING ABOUT IS IF WE JUST RELYING ON THE CODE SAYING YEAH THIS PERSON'S OKAY. THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY COULD BE GETTING. POTENTIALLY THEY COULD BEGIN A BRIBE AND AND MAYBE THIS IS SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER EVEN PLAYED LACROSSE. OR WHATEVER IT IS IT'S IN SO HOW DO WE HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE IT SAYS OKAY YOU'RE SAYING THIS PERSON. IS AN EXCEPTIONAL ATHLETE OR MAYBE THEY'RE AN EXCEPTIONAL VIOLINIST. WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT GOES ACROSS CHECKS THAT TO SAY OKAY THEY'RE ACTUALLY. DOING THIS AT THE SCHOOLS ARE COMING FROM -- THERE IN ROLLED SOME IN SOME SORT OF YOUR VIOLINIST ACADEMY OR YOU HAVE BEEN A PART OF A LOCAL -- SYMPHONY IS THERE ANY CROSS CHECKING THAT GOES ON THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS. EIGHT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE THAT SOME OF THOSE ITEMS AS THIS THIS PANEL WAS POINTED OUT. BECAUSE OF WELL HEELED INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLE CRAFTING PROCESS YOU HAD THE FAKE DOCUMENTATION. YOU HAD THE FAKE. OR FRAUDULENT BOARD RESULTS YOU HAD THE MONEY GOING THROUGH CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHECK BECAUSE UR OUTSIDE I DON'T HAVE SUBPOENA POWER. AND I'M NOT ABLE TO GO INTO A BANK ACCOUNT CATION IS PROVIDED BY A SCHOOL THAT'S FRAUDULENT ON THERE AND AND REYES BEYOND THAT TO LOOK AND SEE IF IT'S UNTRUE SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF LAYERS TO THIS. THE NEED TO BE EXAMINED I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY BUT YOU CAN CHECK OF SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY A SOCCER PLAYER READ IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE I THINK WE SHOULD DO YOU DO THAT. WE DO HAVE. TO BE CLEAR PEOPLE CAN COME INTO A PROGRAM DECIDE NOT TO PLAY. AT ALL DAY ONE THERE'S NOTHING SURE WE CAN BUILD BUT WE KNOW IF THEY ACTUALLY DID PLAY BEFORE THEY GOT THERE RIGHT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD THOSE WILL BE. LETTERS AND INFORMATION PROVIDED FROM THE SCHOOL. SO IF THE SCHOOL IS NOT ACCURATE OR IF THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE CRACKED IN THE PROCESS. AND YOU SEND FOR VERIFICATION VERIFICATION COMES BACK. THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR DO WE DO THAT. TO VERIFY WITH THE SCHOOL BUT WE RELY ON THE EXPERT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HEARD FIRST THERE'S AN AUDIT PROCESS. THAT THE ADMISSIONS THEY WILL DO A A REVIEW AND SAMPLING OF THE PROCESSOR IDENTIFY IF THERE ARE ISSUES. RIGHT SO THEN YOU GET MY OFFICE WHICH IS ONE STEP REMOVED I'M THE INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY I WILL LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE. AND EXAMINE IF THOSE WERE ADEQUATE IF WE SHOULD BE TWEAKING THEM IF THERE'S OTHER THINGS. THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING BUT THE CRUX OF THIS CASE TO FIND INFORMATION AT THAT ADMISSIONS PROCESS SEES REALIZE SO A FAKE SAT. WE CAN DRILL ALL WE WANT THAT'S CONTRARY DIFFICULT I AGREE I'M I'M MORE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU CAN. AND THAT'S WHAT INDEPENDENT ROBERT AND I THINK IT'S VERY FELL POINT THAT WE NEED TO CONTROL WHAT WE CAN'T CONTROL AND EXAMINE -- THE THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN FERRET OUT THESE ISSUES ONCE AND THEN IT JUST SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR ROLE A LITTLE BIT LIKE. WANT TO LOOK INTO THESE THINGS IF YOU FIND THAT AN EMPLOYEE IS ACTED WRONGFULLY OR HAS VIOLATED ETHICAL RULES. THEN ARE YOU VIEW YOUR OFFICE PROCEEDS WITH DISCIPLINE AGAINST THOSE INDIVIDUALS NO SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE BOUGHT IT AND WE IDENTIFY ISSUES WHATEVER THOSE ISSUES MAY BE. QUITE WE WILL MAKE REFERRALS TO THE APPROPRIATE TO INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY AND I WILL NOTIFY THE PRESIDENT. AND ALSO THE REGIONS OF THE ITEMS THAT WE FOUND IF WE FIND STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS. WE WILL DO WHAT'S CALLED MANAGEMENT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WE WILL TELL THE INDIVIDUAL -- CAMPUS FOR A HOLES THE SYSTEM WHAT WE RECOMMEND NEEDS TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS WE'VE IDENTIFIED. AND THEN WE WILL IF THEY'RE ADOPTED BY THE REGENTS. WE WILL THEN FOLLOW THEM TO GROUND TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED. AND THEN WE WILL VERIFY INDEPENDENTLY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. IMPLEMENTED SO YOU'VE BEEN TASKED BY THE PRESS AND THE REGION YES. AND BUT I BELIEVE THE COMMENT WAS THE SWIFT DISCIPLINARY ACTION. IS THAT CORRECT OR NO. ARE YOU JUST COME BACK WITH A RECOMMENDATION IF YOU FIND WRONGDOING YOU'RE GONNA REPORT AND THEN THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION ON THE FACT FINDING AN AUDIT FUNCTIONS. SO WE ARE TO LOOK THE ITEMS IN PROVIDE AT THE PRESIDENT AND THE REGION'S WITH AN ON FOREST VIEW OF WHAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT AND THEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS WE THINK ARE APPROPRIATE. OKAY CAN WE GET A COPY OF THAT REPORT AS WELL WHAT IT WHEREVER YOU REPORT IS THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD SEE THAT AS WELL. NOT JUST THE REGIONS IN THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW THAT ACTION IS BEING TAKEN ON WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU FIND. CAN WE GET A COPY OF THAT REPORT ONE IS COMPLETE. THAT'S A DECISION THAT WILL HAVE TO REFER TO MY SUPERIORS OKAY. FROM THIS FROM THIS COMMITTEE MEMBER I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT. I WANTED THAT THAT MY COLLEAGUES. ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SO MAYBE MAKE THAT WILL THIS MAKE THAT A FORMAL REQUEST. SURE OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARTUCCI THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER GALLAGHER ASKED A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS I WAS PLANNING TO ASK BUT JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. IT IS. AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS BUT DID YOU SAY THAT SOMEONE SAY THAT. TO THE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ADMISSIONS BY EXCEPTIONS OR ARE AROUND 2% -- AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL. SYSTEM WIDE SYSTEM WHY SYSTEM WHERE OKAY THERE UNDER 2% UNDER OKAY AND AND ALSO THE A JUST FOCUSING ON ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT I READ I BELIEVE THERE IS A UCLA WOMEN'S SOCCER COACH -- THAT -- AND IT AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE INDICTMENT IS THAT CORRECT. I DON'T KNOW. I A I THINK IT'S AN AND THE DEAD THE NEWS -- I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION OKAY OKAY -- SO IF IF WE WERE TO AT TO SAY THAT THERE WAS A UCLA WOMEN'S SOCCER COACH. INVOLVED HERE. IF. IF THE STUDENT WERE TO BE ADMITTED WITH THAT WITH THAT STUDENT BE A A ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENT OR NOT NECESSARILY SO. IT TO THE FALL UNDER THE HOOD. IT COULD BE BUT NOT NECESSARILY BUT NOT NECESSARY OKAY MY LIMITED VIEWS BASED UPON WHAT THE INDICTMENT INDICATED THAT THESE WERE NON SCHOLARSHIP. ATHLETES NOT SCULPTURE WALK ONS OKAY WERE BROUGHT IN AND THEN. DID NOT PLAY AT ALL -- PLAY FOR SOME LIMITED PORTION THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE INDICTMENT AND WHAT'S BEEN SPELLED OUT. SO I HAVE NO FURTHER INFORMATION ON THAT. ARE -- AT THEIR LIKE QUOTAS OF YOU KNOW THE QUOTAS OR SET ASIDES -- FOR SPECIAL ADMITS -- BY SPORT. I NEED CAMPUS. AND I'VE NEVER HEARD IN ALL MY YEARS OF ANY PARTICULAR QUOTAS -- SET ASIDE BY SPORT -- EIGHT IT IS RECOGNIZE THAT ALL TEAMS WANT TO FIELD TEAMS AND AND MAKE THEIR CASE FOR THE STUDENTS THAT THEY WANT TO ADMIT -- WE DON'T EVEN HAVE QUOTAS PER SE FOR MAJOR STATE THEY MAY BE CAPPED -- BECAUSE OF JUST PEER CAPACITY LOTUS F. FOR FOR ANY ASPECT TO IT TO MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE OF THE UNIVERSE. SO TO AND IT WAS -- IN A KNOWLEDGE THERE THERE ARE NO SUCH A QUOTAS OR SET ASIDES -- FOR FOR THE DARK SO IT'S OF NO. AND SO. A. AS A GENERAL ADMISSIONS POLICY. IS THE POLICY JUSTIFICATION. FOR MAKING ADMISSIONS BY EXCEPTIONS. FOR A NON AT ATHLETIC SCHOLAR WILL NOT NON SCHOLARSHIP ATHLETES --% THE THE THE THE GENERAL DIVERSITY ARGUMENT THAT THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE SOME. SOME -- THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIVERSITY OF THE STUDENT BODY IS AT THE BASIC. IN CERTAIN WAYS SO FOR EXAMPLE MUSICIANS ARE ARE FOLKS IN A PERFORMING ARTS ARE FOLKS WHO WERE HOME SCHOOLED -- THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE VERY UNIQUE INDUSTRY WERE AREA WHERE CERTAIN KINDS OF THINGS WEREN'T AVAILABLE TO THEM -- OUT -- BUT YET YES. ALL OF THE INDICATORS INDICATE THAT THAT'S TO WOULD ACTUALLY THRIVE AT THE UNIVERSITY THOSE KIND OF THINGS. OKAY I I GUESS I IF YOU JUST WANT -- TO AND MY QUESTIONS WITH WITH THE THOUGHT THAT -- YOU KNOW I I HEARD MS LI MONA I KNOW SHE HAS EXPERIENCE HAVING WORKED AT THE UC SANTA BARBARA -- AND AND AND SHE KNOWS PEOPLE THAT -- ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA THE OPERATION THERE BUT YOU KNOW ON THE ONE HAND I HEAR THIS VERY THOROUGH. VETTING OF APPLICATIONS WITH A WITH A C. THEY THEY THEY LOOK FOR FOR DISCREPANCIES -- TO TO TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT -- PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED THEMSELVES TO BE WHO THEY ARE IN FACT WITH THEY ARE. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. WE SEEM TO HAVE [inaudible] YOU KNOW. A SYSTEM THAT AT LEAST ALLOWED -- IT TO STUDENTS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT. WERE ALLOWED WITHOUT. A SIMILAR TYPE OF VETTING -- AT LEAST INADEQUATE VETTING AND SO -- BY -- YOU GUYS THEY SHARE THE MY MY COLLEAGUES CALLS THAT THE THAT THAT WE HAVE A A THOROUGH EVALUATION ESPECIALLY OF OF THESE -- ATHLETIC RECOMMENDATIONS -- THAT SEEM.

YOU CAN ONLY YOU CAN ONLY HAVE TWO PEOPLE STANDING AT ONE TIME -- Và AND FOR YOUR FIRST TWO YEARS OUR CLASSES ARE THREE FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE PER CLASS AND THIS IS ASSUMING YOU CAN GET INTO THEM EVEN WITH CLASS SIZES BIG. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IMPACTED MAJOR I'VE NEVER HAD A QUARTER RAKE ALL THE CLASSES THAT I NEED IT OB AND MY PEERS FIND THEMSELVES STUCK TAKING CLASSES THEY DON'T NEED. BECAUSE THEIR REQUIREMENTS A LOT BEFORE THEIR FIRST ENROLLMENT TIME -- IN THIS IS FORCING STUDENTS TO TAKE CLASSES OVER THE SUMMER.

GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I AM THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT EXTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR THE ASSOCIATES DANCE EASY SAN DIEGO SO I ESSENTIALLY REPRESENT OUR UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION. LAST YEAR A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION WAS GIVEN ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN MY CAMPUS UC SAN DIEGO RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN MILLION. WITH THESE DOLLARS THEY WERE ABLE TO HIRE TWO HUNDRED LECTURERS AND TEACHING ASSISTANTS TO ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND WITHOUT THESE ONGOING FUNDS IT WOULD DIRECTLY IMPACT NOT ONLY STUDENT FACULTY RATIOS. BUT TIME TO DEGREE COMPLETION FOR STUDENTS LIKE ME. LAST YEAR THIS BODY ALSO BOUGHT OUT A TUITION AND SERVICES FEE INCREASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO IS MY HOPE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE AN ONGOING INVESTMENT THIS YEAR IN ORDER TO PREVENT ANY INCREASES. IN THE COST FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND OUR INSTITUTION WE'RE ALSO VERY EXCITED TO SEE BASIC NEEDS SERVICE SAYS BEING OF SUPPORTED IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET AND HOPE TO SEE IT IN THE FINAL VERSION ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK IN JUNE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL TO ALSO -- CALL INTO QUESTION AT THE COMPLETELY LEGAL WAYS IN WHICH STUDENTS CAN BUY THEIR WAY INTO THIS UNIVERSITY -- SO I AM A LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND I TOOK THE SAT HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO APPLIED ALONGSIDE ME TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHO WERE ABLE TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON TEST PREP SERVICES -- AND I I THINK THAT THERE'S A GREATER CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE HOT OF LIKE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE THE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS BEING TAKEN DOWN. AND HOW DO WE SUPPORT STUDENTS WHEN THEY ENTER OUR INSTITUTION -- THERE IS A COLLEGE BLOCK GRANT THAT I THINK IS A REALLY GREAT ALTERNATIVE FOR THIS BODY TO LOOK INTO THANK YOU THANK YOU.

S.. AS A FEMALE I WAS THERE'S LESS THAN 20% OF US IN MY FIELD AND AS A PERSON WITH A LEARNING DISABILITY THERE'S ABOUT LESS THAN ONE OF US IN GRADUATE EDUCATION. BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE UC SYSTEM THAT WILL INCREASE THE TRAJECTORY OF DIVERSITY THAT WE SEE CAN NOT ONLY IN GRADUATE STUDENTS BUT ALSO IN FACULTY WHICH CAN RECRUIT NEW TALENT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT. BE ENCOURAGED TO JOIN THESE FIELDS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MARK WINDOWS WITH US YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE -- SOME BRIEF COMMENTS ON ITEM NUMBER -- THREE S.
