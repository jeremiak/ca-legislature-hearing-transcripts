WHITE HOUSE DE AND OTHER MEMBERS AS YOU JOINED HAVE SAYS WARNER REALLY APPRECIATE YOU PRESENTLY FOR YOU'LL COMMITMENT TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- THAT I'M GONNA FRAME OUT WHICH IS. DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL- REFORM AND FEES AND ACCOUNTABILITY- YOU'VE BEEN YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS A LONG TIME FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS THE YEAR TO GET IT DONE- I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU FULL THE NEXT ITEM- WHICH IS DROUGHT- WHICH IS SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON SO BOTH TWO VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES- FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS JARED BLUMENFELD I'M THE SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. AND REALLY YOU HAVE THIS PRIORITY OF WORKING TOGETHER TO FIX FUND AND ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF D. DS C. HAS TO BE A TOP PRIORITY- YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU LIVED IN A COMMUNITY AS MANY DID. WHETHER FACILITY ALL OUT OLD ABANDONED SITE THAT'S TOXIC THAT RIGHTLY BECOMES YOU'LL COMMUNITIES TOP CONCERN AND NOW IT'S OUR TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLEAN UP THE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TOXIC SITES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE SHOWN THAT WE CAN TEN A LEGACY OF BLIGHT INTO NEW OPPORTUNITIES INTO JOBS INTO HELPING HEALTHY FOR THRIVING COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY TO ELIMINATE CANCER CAUSING AND OTHER HARMFUL CHEMICALS FROM PRODUCTS SOLD TODAY- IN GROCERY STORE SHELVES. ACROSS OUR STATE. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT- AND WE HAD TO DO. I CAN THINK OF MORE IMPORTANT ROLE THAN TO PREVENT AND RE HIGH. AND IS AN- THAT REALLY HAS BEEN LEFT. TO FUNCTION NOT AT FULL TILT FOR TOO LONG AND I THINK TOGETHER WE CAN RESOLVE THAT. SAYS TO ME THIS THIS IS OUR TIME THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE UP TO OUR ROLES AS STEWARDS OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH. I'M AS REAL NARROW AND UNFORTUNATELY RECOGNIZED AS AN UGLY. LEGACY OF STRUCTURAL RACISM WHICH MEANS THAT ACROSS OUR NATION AND OUR STATE. ONE'S PROXIMITY TO A HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE. IS TIED TO THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN. THE ARE VERY REAL AND PRESS IN. AND THEY MUST AND- AND WE NOW THROUGH THIS EFFORT IN FRONT OF US TODAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TENTH BUDGET INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO DO SITE INVEST EIGHT SITE INVESTIGATIONS AND AEGEE COMMUNITIES GROUNDS AND WALK WHAT FORCE PROGRAMS ALL WITHIN EACH A FOCUS. A VOTE FOR REFORM IS A VOTE FOR INVESTING THREE HUNDRED MILLION. DOLLARS IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN WAITING A VERY LONG TIME THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL OF US WE JUST WANT TO LIVE IN SAFE CLEAN PLACES AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR TO LONG. WE'VE OVER PROMISED AND UNDER DELIVERED TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THIS IS A CHANCE TO COME UP WITH A CLEAR PROMISE. AND THEN TO DELIVER. ALL WHILE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I KNEW OF THE SITE BOARDS. I'M PROUD TO WORK EVERY DAY ALONG DOC MEREDITH THE HAVE NECK AND THEY HAVE. LEADERSHIP AT THE- AND I PERSONALLY WOULD. DAY IN OUT THANK. TO ACTIVELY AND REFORM THEY'RE NOT WAITING PERMISSION TO IMPAIR. THAT DOING IT BY AND OR- WE- THAT. THIS IN PACK NEED TO GO FOR- IN. THE TRY BILL. I'M AS ONE. WE CON RATE OUT. THE FUNDING FROM THE REFORM FROM- THE ACCOUNTABILITY THEY ONLY TO HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE USE SENATE- I'M AND THE LEGISLATURE GENERALLY GOING. TO WEEKLY MEETINGS- WITH WITH YOUR STAFF WITH STAKEHOLDERS. I'M AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BEEN RESPONSIVE TED THAT VERY LARGE VOLUME OF SUGGESTIONS THE PEOPLE SENATE THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL. WE'VE MADE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE ASPECT WE'VE BEEN RESPONSIVE TO- AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS THE LONG STANDING CONCERNS OUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE DEPARTMENT IS RUNNING BAD- BUT AS THE WHITE LIGHT ANALYSIS THAT THAT WAS PAINSTAKINGLY DONE BY FRANCESCA NAY GREEN HAD AMAZING TEAM SHOWS. THERE'S A BIG GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO IS THE DEPARTMENT AND WHAT WAY FUNDED TO DO. COMMUNITIES CANNOT WAIT- THAT ECONOMIC RECOVERY NEEDS TO BE EQUITABLE AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS ENTIRE PACKAGE MOVES US IN A VERY REAL WAY TOWARDS CLEANING OUT THE LEGACIES OF THE PAST. PROVIDING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A NOSE FULL OF THEIR OWN- BEEN SITED NEXT TO HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES AND TODAY WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND TEN OUT OF THAT TO THE DIRECTOR DR MEREDITH WILLIAMS I HAVE. INTRODUCTION SOME DOCTOR WILLIAMSON I MEAN THIS I OF. NOT HAVING A LACK OF SUGGESTIONS IS- FERTILE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE IDEA OF OVER PROMISING AND UNDER DELIVERING I KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A ADJUSTMENT ON THE FEES. HAVE SET FORTH IN OUR THE REPORTINTO THREE YEARS BUT WE MAGICALLY BEEN ABLE COME UP NINETY TWO STATURE. AND THINGS THAT YOU YOUR SHE BE DOING INCLUDING GREEN KEVIN. WHICH IS ONE OF THE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF LEGISLATORS LIKE TO TALK ABOUT I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE TO GET THAT. GREEN ADVISORY BOARD BACK TOGETHER AND TRY TO GET IT SET UP AND THERE WAS NO CHECK COMING FROM THE LEGISLATURE SO IT'S- IT'S A- IT READS LIKE EITHER A NIGHTMARE OR ADD- WELL IT'S A CALL TO ACTION SO PLEASE PROCEED. YEAH IT WAS A GOOD MATCH. ARE THAT HAPPENED IN. EVEN GETTING THE. I WAS VERY REGULATION SPECIFIC PRODUCTS PROGRAM ESTABLISH AND THEN GETTING OUT OPEN RUN. SO THANK YOU CHAIR OSCAR THANK YOU THE OTHER OF THE COMMITTEE ON FOR THE RECORD AGAIN NAME IS WILLIAMS AND- OF THE OF TALK STUFF CONTROL. AND WOMAN FILLED WITH CAN COME CONVEY THAT SENSE URGENCY ABOUT TRAILER BILL. AND UNDER THE TIME SINCE THE OUT GETTING THIS DURING THE BUDGET CYCLE. THE FOR IS STRONG IN. THOSE THREE FUN COME OF THE PART THE NEED FROM TRAINS. ACCOUNT AND- STABILITY THE CHEST YOU- WAIT WAIT POINT HONESTLY DECADES THE MAKING. IT COMPREHENSIVE IN ADDRESSES ALL. IT'S NOT SAME PROPOSAL LAST YEAR WE THINK THIS YEAR'S BOOK. FOR STRONGER AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR IS WE A GREAT DEAL DURING THE DEVELOP. AND JUST GO ARE. EIGHTEEN NINE. AND SO WHAT SEE THIS YEAR THERE ARE PROVIDE. FOR ACCOUNT. FOR INSTANCE STRONG WORK FOR DECISION. AT HAND FOR RECORDING OUT ON A PROGRAM ON ON MAKING PERMIT- WE ARE. HOLDING POLLUTERS MORE WITH STRONGER FINANCE SURE MACINNES. I DON'T REALLY TALK QUITE A STORY ABOUT WHERE OUR GAPS ARE. AND THAT ALLOWS US IN THIS YEAR'S PROPOSALS TO FUND TO REALLY HAVE THE BASIS TO SAY WE NEED NOT JUST CLOSE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BUT ALSO CLOSE SOME CRITICAL GAPS SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN MORE CLOSELY NEED ITS MISSION. ALL OF THESE CHANGES CAME AS A RESULT OF STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PRECIADO THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ONE ON ONE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS EITHER PAST OR UPCOMING- WILL ALSO BE GIVING THEIR THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THE DEPARTMENT WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE REFORM EFFORTS. AND WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE AND THAT'S BEEN AGAIN TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL IN STRENGTHENING THE PROPOSAL. AS JERRY TALKED TO POINTED OUT WERE MEETING WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS WE- ARE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND COMMUNITY D. MEMBER REPRESENTATIVES WITH ALL MEMBERS OF THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND ALL OF THIS. TRANSFORMING OUR UNDERSTANDING. OF WHERE. THIS PROPOSAL NEEDS. THERE AS A RESULT THAT GREAT CAN YOU THERE ARE JUST GAS BUT- THE TRAILER PROPOSAL IN. ONE BUT I DO TO HIGH JUST A COUPLE THOSE- ONE WOULD BE THE DECIDING. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO GIVES TO THE BOARD THAT SHE SETTING. WITH BE SUB TO LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO HIGHLIGHTS. ALSO WE WELL BOTH PROPOSALS INCLUDE A MODERNIZE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE TIME AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT. IS RELYING ON THOSE INCREASED REVENUES TO FUND WILL WORK ON A HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN AND SO WE THINK IT'S RESPONSIBLE IMPROVE A LOT TO MOVEMENTS NOT TO TAKE ON THAT WORK. ON UNTIL WE. HAVE THE RESOURCES IN PLACE TO DO IT. AND THEN- WHAT WEEK AB ONE DO STILL CONTAIN A PROVISION FOR ANY. TASK FORCE AND I WOULD SAY. THAT GIVEN ALL THE WORK TO BE DONE TO. CONSIDER DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND DIFFERENT STRUCTURES WE WERE VERY CONFIDENT IN. THE STRUCTURAL PUTTING FORTH IN TERMS OF ITS FUNDAMENTAL COMPLIANCE CONSISTENCY WITH THE COMMUTER PAYS HER WHICH AND WITH ITS ABILITY TO MEET THE REVENUE TARGETS. AND MORE EQUITABLE WE JUST DISTRIBUTE THE COSTS OF BOTH FOR THAT THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT AS WELL AS FOR THE TRUCKS TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL HELPED. HELLO ARE I COULD GO ON WITH THE DETAIL OF THE PROPOSAL- BUT I WILL WRAP UP MY COMMENTS SO THAT WE HAVE TIME FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND I WILL JUST- TURNED IT OVER TO AGAIN SHE STAFF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FRANCESCA DEGREE. AND TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK HER FOR ALL HER LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING THAT WORKLOAD ANALYSIS TO FRUITION TRANSFORMS DISCUSSION THANK YOU DEPUTY NAY GRIEF HOLD THAT SECOND. A MISS ROY IF WE COULD ESTABLISH A QUORUM IF YOU COULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ONE CASKEY HERE WHAT KASKY HERE DOLLY. DOLLY HERE MCGUIRE. HERE MCGUIRE HERE STERN. OKAY A PHARMACIST IS AS PRESENT. OKAY. WE HAVE NUMEROUS HEARINGS ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW SO- THE DEADLINE IS UPON US- WE WILL LET'S CONTINUE WITH OUR TOXIC THIS DISCUSSION A DEPUTY MAKERS. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE T. S. C. FISCAL AND GOVERNANCE REFORM AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- BUT THE REFORM ITSELF BUILDS ON AND YEARS OF IMPLEMENTING A CULTURE OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. THIS IS BEEN DONE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SECRETARY BLUMENFELD AND DIRECTOR WILLIAMS AND HAS BEEN ILLUSTRATED IN THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS IN ADDITION TO THE GAPS WE TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE USING OUR RESOURCES AND- ILLUSTRATED THE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES TO DEMONSTRATE OUR INCREASED SEWARDSHIP OF THOSE RESOURCES FROM DECREASING PERMITTING TIME FRAMES TO. STREAMLINING THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM TO- STRENGTHENING OUR ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AND- STREAMLINING OUR VOLUNTARY CLEANUP PROGRAM ALL OF THESE PROGRAMMATIC IMPROVEMENTS HAVE SET US UP I THINK FOR BEING READY FOR FISCAL AND GOVERNANCE REFORMS AND HELP TO BUILD- TRUST IN OUR ABILITY TO. TO MANAGE INCREASED RESOURCES. AND TO- THE SUCCESSFUL WITH- THE GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVE TO INCLUDE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS PROPOSAL THAT PROTECTS PEOPLE'S IMPACT PEOPLE AND STRENGTHENS COMMUNITIES- IT WILL BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT WAS IDENTIFIED AS BEING DEFICIENT WITHIN DGSE TO CONDUCT. SITE DISCOVERY AND INVESTIGATION AND THE FEE STRUCTURE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED WILL PROVIDE ONGOING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM. IT ALSO INCLUDES A WORKFORCE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THAT WILL- PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND JOBS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ARE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN. OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOXIC SUBSTANCES- THE OUTCOME WILL BE SAFER- AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHEN I TALK ABOUT THESE COMMUNITIES I'M TALKING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THE ONES THAT- SECRETARY BLUMENFELD MENTIONED THAT ARE IN THE TOP TWENTY FIVE OF OUR CALOMBARIS SCREEN- THE SYSTEM AND- ALSO HAVE BEEN- IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING HAVE HAVING VERY HIGH HOUSING NEEDS- WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING IN ADDITION TO THE SESSIONS- WITH YOUR TEAMS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THE REFORM PACKAGE ITSELF. WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING LISTENING SESSIONS ON THE- ON THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TALKING ABOUT- OUR PLANS- IF THIS PROPOSAL IS APPROVED- FOR HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING AND STARTING WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WE INTEND TO. CONDUCT SITE DISCOVERY- IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE FISCAL YEAR I'M CONDUCTING URGENCY OPTIONS DEPENDING ON WHAT WE FIND IN CONDUCT RESPONSIBLE PARTY SEARCHES- WILL BE PROMOTING THAT THE GRANTS PROGRAM THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. PROVIDING EDUCATION ON THAT PROGRAM AND OPENING UP THE APPLICATION PERIOD- IN ADDITION- WILL CONDUCTING LISTENING SESSIONS ON THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND I DID FIND NEED TO COMMUNITIES TO MATCH SKILL SETS AND- AND- ARCHER. OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE WORK BEING PERFORMED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE DETAIL ON ON THAT PLAN BUT JUST WANTED TO LEAVE YOU WITH- THE THOUGHT THAT THIS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS PART OF THAT LARGER REFORM EFFORT THAT. DIRECTOR WILLIAMS DESCRIBED THAT INCLUDES A FISCAL PACKAGE TO STREAMLINE OUR OUR HAZARDOUS WHERE HE STRUCTURE HAS JUST WEST CONTROL ACCOUNT AND ALIGN IT WITH THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ADEQUATE FUNDING OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. TO ADDRESS THE MOST CRITICAL NEEDS- THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE WORKLOAD ANALYSES AND TO PROVIDE- SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR- A BOARD THAT WILL- STRENGTHEN ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE DEPARTMENT. SO WITH THAT- AND MY COMMENTS AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU DEPUTY **** YOU CAN'T SEE MY FACE BECAUSE I'M I'M RECALLING ONE AND TEN YEARS AGO IN TWENTY ELEVEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I DID IT OVERSIGHT. OF THE T. S. C. N. IT OUT MY GOD IF THE IF. THE PLAYERS COULD SEE OUR STAFF REPORT AND REALIZED THAT THE- PROGRAM'S REFORMS IN THE PROBE PROGRAMMING WE'RE- ALL IN LINE WITH YEAH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER. THE APPOINTEES REPORT TO KELLY P. A. R. D. T. S. C. OR DO WE HAVE- THE SENATE APPROVED THEM IT'S REALLY MINUSCULE COMPARED TO THE THAT THE STEPS THAT WE'VE TAKEN AND- IN THE DECADE- BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STEAL THE ALEJO'S. THUNDER I WILL- RECOGNIZE MISTER BROWN'S. OR DO I HAVE FINANCE FIRST. LET'S HAVE THIS OF LA- FOR ANIMAL HAVE FINAL. THEY CAN DO RE. MISTER MISTER BROWN. GOOD MORNING MR CAN MEMBERS PRIME BROWN WITH L. A. L. I. MEXICAN TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FRANK MENACE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN VERS FRANK MENACE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- OUR OFFICE HAS PREPARED A PRESENTATION TODAY AND I'M GOING TO GIVE THAT UP FOR YOU GUYS. GOT IT. THANK MISTER CAN YOU SEE THAT. YES I CAN MYSTERY MENACE PERFECT OKAY SO- YEAH SO ONE THING ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR COMPONENTS- THE FIRST BEING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- A PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURE SHORTFALL WITHIN THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL THE STRUCTURAL SHORTFALL WITHIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND- FOR BROWNFIELD CLEANUPS ACROSS THE STATE- FOR THE BOARD ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BOARD- WE FIND AT THE BOARD SUCH AS THIS CAN- IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. OUR WRECKING RECOMMENDING THREE MODIFICATIONS TO INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THE FIRST BEING THAT THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY EACH HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY- TO APPOINT A BOARD MEMBER- THAT GUBERNATORIAL BOARD MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO SENATE CONFIRMATION. AND AT THE BORDER BOARD ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE ARE- ON THE DEPARTMENT'S PERFORMANCE. FOR THE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WITHIN THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNTS- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVE ONE TIME GENERAL FUNDS OF TWENTY TWO AND A HALF MILLION- IN THE BUDGET YEAR THIS WOULD SOLVE THE THIS WOULD KEEP THE FUND SOLVENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHEN ALLOWED THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE. WITH ITS CURRENT PROGRAMMATIC EXPENDITURES- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE H. W. C. H. R. TREE STRUCTURE AND INCREASES WE FIND THAT THE RESTRUCTURE- HAS BENEFITS OVER THE CURRENT ONE. AND AT THE INCREASES TO THE FEES WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT REVENUES BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THEY'RE DRESSED THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BUT ALSO ALLOW FOR. INCREASED PROGRAMMATIC EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT'S FROM REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND WE FIND THAT THE INCREASE PROGRAMMATIC EXPENDITURES RELATE SAID THE DEPARTMENT'S WORKLOAD ANALYSIS WHICH FOUND DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF JUST THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE GOVERNORSHIP ALTHOUGH TO GRANT THE BOARD WITH THE ABILITY TO ADJUST CHARGE LEVELS IN FUTURE YEARS. THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT REVENUES- MATCH EXPENDITURES THAT ARE APPROVED EACH YEAR IN THE BUDGET ACT BY THE LEGISLATURE. FOR THE ROLE THE TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WITHIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. SIMILAR WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OF THIRTEEN MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR- THIS WOULD KEEP THE FUND SOLVENT AND ALLOW DEPARTMENT CAN YOU ITS EXISTING PROGRAMMATIC EXPENDITURES. HOWEVER FOR THIS ONE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT A TAX PACKAGE THAT RACES SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO PAY FOR DESIRED EXPENDITURES THAT REFLECT LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. I'M SIMPLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE SAFER TASK- THE MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE TAX THAT SUPPORTS THE ACCOUNT- SAYS SOLVE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BUT ALSO FOR INCREASED PROGRAMMATIC EXPENDITURES. HOWEVER WE FIND THAT BECAUSE- TOSCA IS FUNDED BY A BROAD BASED BUSINESS TAX AND- FUNDS A VARIETY OF DEPARTMENT ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF REGULATORY ACTIVITIES. WE THINK THAT THE EXPENDITURE AND TAX INCREASE SHOULD REFLECT LEGISLATIVE- PRIORITIES. AND WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE ULTIMATELY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO ALLOW THE NEW BOARD SUGGESTS THAT TAX IN FUTURE YEARS. THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT REVENUES- MATCH EXPENDITURES THAT APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN EACH BUDGET ACT- ONE THINKING ABOUT THE TAX INCREASE FOR TOSCA TO ENSURE THAT. I'M SUFFICIENT REVENUES ARM ARM CREATED TO MEET LEGISLATIVE- PRIORITIES FOR EXPENDITURES- WE pSHOULD ALSO REFLECT LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THE FIGURE ON THE LEFT INDICATES THE LEGISLATURE AREN'T THEY MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL. AS YOU CAN SEE- SMALLER BUSINESSES WOULD NOW BE EXEMPT FROM PAYING THE TAX. MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE PAYING THE SAME AMOUNT IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND MOST OF THE INCREASE WOULD BE PLACED ON LARGER BUSINESSES. I'M IN THE MINISTRATION AS INDICATED THAT THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE LARGELY BECAUSE OF OUR IN RESPONSE THE PANDEMIC. IN OUR ANALYSIS WE PROVIDE TO- OVERARCHING POLICY QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHEN CONSIDERING THIS INCREASE. THE FIRST BEING AS IF AND DEMOCRAT LATED RELIEF MEASURES- SHOULD BE INCLUDED. WE FIND THAT THIS APPROACH ISN'T THE MOST TARGETED WAY TO- ADDRESS IMPACTS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. WE FIND THAT THE SIZE OF BUSINESS WON'T NECESSARILY RELATE TO NEED IT'S GOING TO VERY INDUSTRY TO INDUSTRY- HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE WHERE TO FIND THAT- TAX INCREASE IN STRUCTURE SUCH AS THIS WERE REFLECTED ITS PRIORITIES- A SECOND QUESTION WE RAISES. WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE A MECHANISM IN THE FUTURE- TO BRING IN. TO REMOVE EXAMS BECAUSE THE EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PUT FORWARD WOULD BE PERMANENT. SO HAVING A MECHANISM IN PLACE FOR WHEN THE STATE HAS ENTERED ECONOMIC RECOVERY- TO REVIEW THESE AND BRING THESE BUSINESSES BACK INTO PAYING THE TAX. WELL WHAT DO YOU ALSO THINK ABOUT THERE'S A LOT OF. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU YOU'RE PICKING UP A BIGGER FEE FROM PEOPLE AT A COST OUT FOR THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT YOU HAVE TO DO A ONE OF THE- ISSUES IT'S RACES THAT THE SMALLER. BUSINESSES IT IT SPEND MORE TIME AND MORE MONEY CHASING DOWN THE FEE THEN IT'S THEN IT THEN IT ACTUALLY BRINGS INTO. BRINGS INTO THE FUN- YEAH THAT THAT'S THAT'S AN ARGUMENT AND I GUESS YOU KNOW EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN IDEA OF WHAT A SMALL BUSINESSES BUT- ID ONE DEFINITION IS LESS THAN A HUNDRED PEOPLE SO THAT. SEEMS TO BE. THE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES BETWEEN FIFTY AND NINETY NINE IS THAT. WHAT IT WOULD HAVE TO SAY ABOUT BUT- THAT I MEAN I KNOW THAT ARGUMENT IS FOR THE PEOPLE UNDER FIFTY TWO SMALL. SPECIFIC UP IT IS IT IS IT WORTH OUR TIME. WE'RE DOING THIS REFORM- IN SPEAKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY INFORMATION TO INDICATE THAT- EXEMPTING THESE BUSINESSES WOULD PROVIDE- SAVINGS AND THAT ESSENTIALLY WE WOULD BE. PAYING MORE TO COLLECT THAN REVENUES WOULD BE BROUGHT IN SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING ELSE BEGIN DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF WHETHER. IT'S WORTH IT TO EXEMPT AND CONTINUE TO EXAM SO- THAT WOULD BE MY RESPONSE AND WHETHER. ACCEPTING THESE BUSINESSES IS WORTH THE STATE'S- EFFORTS IN TRYING TO COLLECT RIGHT NOW AND I GUESS IF IT IF WE JUST. ARGUMENTATIVE POLICE SAY WE ACCEPT THE PANDEMIC AFFECTING PEOPLE TRYING TO GET ON THEIR FEET AND ALL THAT. WOULD BE S. EXEMPTION THAT YOU WOULD SAY- AND ENDED SUNSETS IN FIVE YEARS OR WHATEVER WHATEVER WHENEVER WE THINK PEOPLE ARE BACK ON THEIR FEET. SO THAT THE- THE BOARD COULD DETERMINE IF THEY WANTED TO EXTEND IT BECAUSE IT IS A TWO THIRDS VOTE SO YOU. IF YOU SAY NO FOREVER THAT IS NO FOREVER RIGHT OR YOU KNOW THE TWO THIRDS VOTE OKAY. PROCEED I'VE AND THEN WHAT THE RAMPAL PLAN A PROPOSAL- WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THE MERITS OF THIS PROPOSAL INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE OTHER THREE COMPONENTS- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE BROWNFIELDS PROPOSAL IS CONTINGENT ON THE OTHER THREE WE DON'T BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD THINK IN THESE TERMS- IF IT'S PART OF ITS GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS FOR BROWNFIELDS CLEANUPS IT SHOULD AND NOT THINK ABOUT THE OTHER THREE COMPONENTS- HOWEVER OVERALL WE FIND THAT THE BROWNFIELDS PROPOSAL- DOES HAVE A LOT OF MERIT. I'M GETTING MONEY FOR BROWNFIELDS CAN- REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL RISK AND HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTAMINATION- IT CAN ALSO SPUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDER INVESTED- BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP POLICY QUESTIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS THE FIRST TWO FORWARDS ARE LARGER POLICY QUESTIONS THE FIRST BEING IS WHAT IS- THE INTENDED GOAL WHAT GOAL IS THE HIGHEST INTENDED- PRIORITY FOR FUNDING AND WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL HAS TWO MAIN PRIORITIES IT'S THE SPUR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO TO ADDRESS CONTAMINATION THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO IDENTIFY. A PRIMARY GOAL SO FUNDS ARE TARGETED AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTRACT HOW WE'RE MEETING THESE GOALS- FOR THE GRANT PRO- COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ONE INSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDS THAT HOW THIS FUNDING COMPLEMENTS OTHER HOUSING PROPOSALS WITHIN THE BUDGET ACT AND IT SUPPORTS THEM AS WELL- THERE'S NUMEROUS HOUSING PROPOSALS BUT THEN THE BUDGETS WOULD WANT INSURE THAT THIS GRANT COMPONENT I'M COMPLIMENTS THEM AND ENSURES THAT THERE'S NO DUPLICATION AS WELL. AND THAT THIS HOUSING COMPOUND OUTLINES WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES AND THEN FOR IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS GO TO THE BOTTOM TWO- HOW THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE THE HOUSING ATTRACTIVE THEY'RE MAD WE JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS AN EFFECTIVE PLAN TO ENSURE THAT COORDINATING WITH THE APPROPRIATE AGENCIES AND ENSURING THAT HOUSING IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THIS AND THEN FOR THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT WE WANT. TO ENSURE THAT AND SETTING UP THIS PROGRAM THE THOSE WHO ENTER THE PRO. HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LONG TERM. AND SHOWING THAT THE STATE ACT DOES NEED TO RAMP UP TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO. WORK IN THESE AREAS AND THAT WOULD BE TRAINED IN THEM. WHAT WOULDN'T THAT WOULDN'T WOULDN'T THAT YOU KNOW THE SECRETARY. HAS IDENTIFIED WHAT WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SITES. IF WE IF THIS IF THIS THING GOES FORWARD THEY MADE TO THE ASSESSMENT ON. WHAT IT THIRTY OR SIXTY MAYBE A HUNDRED SITES SO IT'S A LONG WAY OFF BEFORE WE FINISH THAT HUNDRED FIFTY. THOUSAND AND WE'RE ONLY DOING IT FOR IDENTIFYING THE MOST TOXIC- WOULDN'T IT IF THE FEES ARE GOING TO BE ADJUSTED. WOULDN'T THAT. INTUITIVELY SAY THAT THIS WORKFORCE IS GOING TO. NEED TO CONTINUE WANT BECAUSE- YOU'LL MOVE FROM ONE TOXIC SITE TO THE NEXT TAX TOXIC SIDE. WERE GREEN WHAT TYPE OF DEMONSTRATION ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME IF IT WAS JUST ONE AND DONE I GET IT WE JUST GAVE MONEY AND IT WAS OVER. AND THERE'S A QUESTION THERE BUT IF IT'S IF WE'RE SETTING THE FEES AND IT'S GOING TO ROUTE REVOLVING ACCOUNT. THAT SHOULD. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU KNOW SIXTY SITES. ASSESSED EVERY YEAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAYBE MORE. DO YOU SEE IT THAT WAY OR NOT YES THAT THAT'S TRUE MISTER CHAIR I THINK WE LARGELY AGREE WITH THAT BUT WE JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT THE STATE DOES NEED IT- MORE TRAINING IN THIS AREA ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT THERE IS AN UNDERLYING UNDER UTILIZE WORK FORCE AND IS THIS RAMPS UP THEY'LL START TO GET EMPLOYED. WE WOULD- NOT AGREE WITH THE STATE'S STARTING A PROGRAM AND HAVING PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED AND WHEN THEY GET OUT INTO THE WORKFORCE AFTER THE TRAINING THAT THERE IS NO LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT. AND SINCE WE ARE INCREASING THE FEES AND THERE WOULD BE INCREASED SOME INCREASE WORKLOAD WITH THAT AND THEN THE BROWNFIELDS MONEY WOULD ALSO COME INTO EFFECT AS WELL WITH BUT THE BROWN PUTS MONEY IS LARGELY. ONE TIME THAT WILL BE SPENT OR MULTIPLE YEARS. YES ENSURING THE FOR THAT TRANSITION PERIOD THAT ONE HE'S- INDIVIDUALS COME OUT OF THE PROGRAM. THAT THEY DO HAVE LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT- SO JUST ENSURING THAT THE STATE. DOESN'T HAVE THE STRAIN WORKFORCE AND ENSURING THAT WERE RAMPING UP TO MEET IT NOT NECESSARY TRAINING PEOPLE JUST FOR TRAINING PEOPLE. OKAY I'LL GET TO A LESS FINANCING. FOLLOW UP THERE LET'S GET TO THE- AGAIN WE'VE GOT SO MUCH STUFF THAT WE AGREE ON AND THAT THAT THE CAN THE- THE BOARD JUST COULD BE CREATED. BUT THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT I MEAN. WE'RE SITTING HERE AND WE CONTROL THE BUDGET OF DGSE N. R. E. P. A. M. ONE OF THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE IS THIS BOARD REPORTING THEIR INDEPENDENT- CONCLUSIONS AT THE AFTER THEY HAVE THE SIX MEETINGS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WOULDN'T WOULDN'T IT BE OBVIOUS OF WHAT WHAT. WHEN THE WHEN THE DIRECTOR COMES BEFORE US WE HEARD HER FOR HER BUDGET AND DGSE AND SAYS THESE ARE THE SITES THAT WE'VE CLEANED UP THESE ARE THE SITES THAT WE ARE WORKING ON- WHY WOULD I NEED TO HAVE CONTROL OR IS IT LEGISLATOR OF THE OF HER OVERSIGHT BOARD THAT IF SHE'S NOT CLEANING IT UP THEN I WANT TO BRING THE OVERSIGHT BOARD BEFORE THE OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT WHY WOULD I. WHY WOULD I WHY WOULD I WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER REPORT THAT THAT I DON'T LOVE READING REPORTS FROM DTS HERE FROM THE SECRETARY OF EPA BUT WHY WOULD I WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER REPORT UNLESS THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG RIGHT ON THE ON THE NATURAL. I GUESS THAT'S MY- BECAUSE YOU SORT OF SET IT UP. THAT WAY THAT WE WOULD GET REPORT AND THE SECOND. IS I KNOW THAT WE LOVE YOU SORT OF A- SINCE I GOT HERE EVERYBODY LIKES TO HAVE ONE PERSON FROM THE ASSEMBLY ONE PERSON FROM THE SENATE THAT SPEAKER THEY GET ON THESE BOARDS. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS A VERY TECHNICAL BOARD THAT'S DOING OVERSIGHT OF THE- TOXICS PROGRAM THIS IS NOT. THIS IS NOT THAT RECREATION. OR PARKS AND RECREATION SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT WE- THE PEOPLE WANT TO SERVE ON THE BOARD IT'S- IT'S A LIMITED GROUP OF PEOPLE. OTHER THAN WE THINK IT'S NICE WHAT WOULD BE THE NEED FOR ME OR MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE PICKING SOMEBODY TO SIT ON THIS BOARD. OTHER THAN. YOU KNOW A POWER TRIP. I'M I THINK IN RESPONSE TO THE THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE REPORTING- WE FIND THAT IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR THE NEW BOARD TO REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF COUNTY PA- WE THINK THAT REPORTING A CRIME IS GOOD AND NEEDED BUT- AT THE SAME TIME TO INCREASE LEGISLATIVE ORDER OVERSIGHT THAT THIS- REPORT SHOULD ALSO BE SENT TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO CAN BE REVIEWED BY THEM- AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT SENT TO BOTH EQUALLY- IN RESPONSE TO THE SECOND COMMENT YOU MADE ABOUT- APPOINTMENTS- WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAVING THE ABILITY TO. APPOINT ITS OWN MEMBERS AND ALSO HAVE THE APPOINTED BY MEMBERS GOT THEIR SENATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS. IT'S JUST ANOTHER AVENUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE DEPRIVE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. AND NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF. ESTABLISHING THIS BOARD AND FOR THE JUST THE GREATER REFORM OF PTSD. SO HAVING THOSE APPOINTED BOARD MEMBERS WOULD HAVE THE LEGISLATURE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ITS OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT BY ENSURING THAT. THE BOARD MEMBERS THAT ARE IMPORTANT NOT ONLY REFLECT THE GOVERNOR'S- USE AS WELL BUT ALL LET. ISSUES ON ON HOW THE BOARD SHOULD BE AROUND AND WE FEEL THAT. A SECOND WHERE MEMBERS A BIG PROCESS OF THAT RIGHT. I GUESS THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THAT. I WANT I WANT DIRECTOR WILLIAMS TO REPORT TO ME- WHAT DTS HE IS DOING AND THEY WERE AND THE BENEFITS AND THE PROGRESS THAT THEY'VE MADE AND THE CITED THEY CLEANED UP. AND I IF THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT THEY'VE COME IN AND SAY WE HAVEN'T CLEANED UP ANY SIDE TO IT AND THERE'S- AND WE'VE HAD SIX PUBLIC HEARINGS AND EVERYBODY'S CRAP AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON. I SORT OF GET THE IDEA THAT I DON'T NEEDED IN A REPORT AYE SO. I'VE I'VE HEARD IT THROUGH SO. IT'S A IT'S- WE'LL WE'LL GET TO THAT LET'S HAVE FINANCE- FINANCE. IF YOU COULD ADDRESS. THE REMEDIATE. FOR THE BENEFIT OF HOUSING AND THAT REMEDIATION. FOR THE PURPOSES JUST REMEDIATION I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF SITES OUT THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO. THIS FIRST BATCH THERE'S THERE SEEMS TO BE A- AN EMPHASIS ON. ON HOUSING AND- THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION OR MAYBE THERE IS YOU GONNA TELL ME BETWEEN H. C. D. N. D. T. S. C. NOT THE- NOT THE GENERAL. THE OBVIOUS CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM BUT THAT'S WHAT THE- STAFF IN- THE L. A. O. HAS RAISED. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ENTER MARCH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SPECIFICALLY TO THAT QUESTION JERRY CASKEY I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE HAS A REQUIREMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL TO CONSULT WITH EACH CD IN THE FORMULATION OF THE GUIDELINES FOR THEIR GRANT PROGRAM- AND THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A CD AND ORDERED TO- PRIOR. KRILLIN AREA IDENTIFY SITES THAT WOULD MEET HUD'S CRITERIA- LIKEWISE EACH CITY ALSO HAS REQUIREMENTS AND THEIR- PROPOSAL FOR A FIVE HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS FOR THEIR INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM TO CONSULT WITH THE GST TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ALIGNED WITH- AREAS WHERE THERE'S HIGH HOUSING NEED. AND ALSO THEY'RE CONTAMINATED SITES BUT DOESN'T MEAN MAYBE DIRECTOR WILLIAMS WHEN YOU GOT TO CLEAN THE SITE SOMETIMES IT BECOMES ECONOMICALLY PROHIBITIVE TO GET IT TO. YOU KNOW- DID WE CAN HAVE BABIES PLAYING IN THERE AND THERE IN THE LAWN IN FRONT THEIR HOUSE PURSES IT BECOMES AN INDUSTRIAL SITE CLEAN VERSES IT BECOMES A COMMERCIAL SITE I MEAN. IS THAT IF YOU'RE THINKING THAT. IF HCD SAYS THIS IS A UNIQUELY POSITIVE SITE FOR HOUSING IT'S. GREAT AND THE CLEAN UP IS AN- RIFIC THAT THAT YOU WOULD SAY. WE IDENTIFY THEM ON JUST SORT OF AFTER WE DO THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF WHAT WE THINK. IS NEEDED TO BE DONE BECAUSE NOT ALL SITES ARE NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL IS THAT YOUR THINKING. I'LL START ON MY ANSWER AND I'M GOING TO TURN OVER SHOULD YOU FRIENDS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR MEMORY BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN MORE INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH CITY ALIGNMENT BUT I WILL SAY THAT- WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE IN THIS AND THERE BEEN A RANGE OF THINGS PEOPLE WANT PARKS PEOPLE WANT TO YOU KNOW A LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS SO FIGURING OUT THE APPROPRIATE CLEAN UP- STANDARD TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SAFETY IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL CROSS THE BORDER NO MATTER NO MATTER WHAT. THE CASE AND OF COURSE. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO A ADVANTAGE OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE THERE COULD BE CASES WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE CONTAMINATED SITES THAT. IN IN A GENERAL AREA AND WE MAY WANT TO FOCUS ON THOSE AND THAT COULD MAYBE DRIVE UP THE COST FOR ONE PARTICULAR SITE. OR MAYBE THERE'S ONE THAT HAS MORE CONTAMINATION AND MAKES THINGS MORE COMPLEX BUT THE OVERALL BENEFIT- OF DOING THAT KIND OF COORDINATION COULD LEAD TO MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES. FRANCESCA'S SURE I AM I THINK THINK YOU THE QUESTION BY JUST TO ADD THAT WE HAVE PART REGARD. WITH AND HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SURE THAT WERE- WILL BE WORKING WE ARE HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE BANNED PARTY WITH THEM CLOSELY TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS WITH HIGH HOUSING NEEDS- AND- AND THOSE VULNERABLE COMMUNITY SAID. THAT THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IS IN THE TOP 25% OF THEM VIRUS SCREEN SO. AND THERE IS A FOCUSED- YOU KNOW THERE'S IT ACCORDED EFFORT TO FOCUS ON ON THESE AREAS FOR THE BROWNFIELD SITES- EXISTING ON AND THEN TO EXACTLY WHAT. THE DOCTOR SAID WHICH IS TO USE A CONDOM USE OF SCALE AND USE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SOME OF THESE SITES AND WE HAVE SOME ORPHAN SITES WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE BEEN IN PROGRESS YOU WILL FORCE WHEN YOU GET THOSE ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WITH SOME OF THE SPENDING- SO. I THINK IT'S- IT'S A COMPLICATED- PROJECT TO BE SURE- AND COORDINATION WILL BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THAT PROCESS. YEAH BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S I MEAN WHEN YOU HAVE THE SIX PUBLIC HEARINGS OR WHEN THE BOARD AS YOU SIX PUBLIC HEARINGS YOU GUYS HAVE YOUR OWN I MEAN. EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF CLEANLINESS AND IN ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT IT SEEMS TO US IS THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT TO GET IT SO THAT IT'S SAFE WHETHER IT'S SAFE ENOUGH TO BUILD HOUSING ON IT. OR SAFE ENOUGH FOR A DEPARTMENT STORE IF WE EVER BILL THE DEPARTMENT STORE NOW BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S ONLINE BUT WHATEVER WHATEVER YOU USE IS GOING TO BE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE. VERY DIFFERENT OF THEM- FIRST THE SIGN OFF ON THEM. I WITH THE SEC. RIGHT IT. IN AND IN ADDITION TO. THE COLLABORATION THAT WE- ARE ENGAGING AND WITH OUR OUR OUR LOCAL AND STATE PARTNERS WILL ALSO BE CONTINUING TO CONDUCT LISTENING SESSIONS WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE- IN THESE AREAS AS WELL TO GET THEIR FEET BACK ON. YOU KNOW- WHAT THE- YOU KNOW WHAT THE ULTIMATE DECISIONS WILL BE FOR THE USE OF THAT PROPERTY AND- AND THAT IN THE FUTURE. YOU KNOW HOUSING NEEDS THAT ARE EXISTING THOSE COMMUNITIES YEAH I MEAN THEY ALEJO ONCE THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES TO RECEIVE THE HIGHEST THE HIGHEST ATTENTION RIGHT AND- HELP TARGET THESE THINGS AND THIS IS. THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONLY GO SO FAR IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE PUBLIC OUT THERE BUT BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE CONTAMINATED SITES YOU COULD BURN THROUGH THIS THOUGH RATHER QUICKLY- AND HOPEFULLY WE GET THE- THE FUN STABILIZER THAT WE CAN. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO GENERATE IT'S NOT GENERATING THAT TYPE BUT GO TO DO THE BROWN FEELS BUT AT LEAST HE GETS ITS- GETS OUR ATTENTION THERE. ALL RIGHT. FINANCE YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO. I'M SORRY SHARE I WOULD JUST. ADD THAT- YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH THAT THE GENERAL FUND IS IN A HEALTHY CONDITION THIS YEAR- I'M GOING HEALTH OF THE GENERAL FUND IS STILL A CONCERN FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND- INCLUDING THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE PROPOSED THIS YEAR- THE GENERAL FUND WELL PROVIDED AROUND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TO BACK FILL DGSE SPECIAL FUNDS I WHICH SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IS BASICALLY- FUNDING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY- HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THEN TO THE ALEJO'S POINT ABOUT SEPARATING THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE OVERALL FEAR PROPOSAL WE JUST POINT OUT THAT IF THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION A SEPARATED FROM THE FEE PROPOSAL. THAT THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION WOULD HAVE TO BE IS FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF COSTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BUILT INTO THE PROPOSAL IS BEING FUNDED FROM THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. AND BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE ONGOING. YEAH THERE'S SOME MAGIC TECH KEEPING THINGS TOGETHER- DIRECTOR WILLIAMS. DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. WE JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THE CLEANUP STANDARDS ARE FIT FOR PURPOSE. WE HAVE BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON CLEAN UP AND THAT MEANS RESIDENTIAL STANDARDS ARE. THE MOST LIKELY CLEANUP STANDARDS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE POINT TO. THAT AS WE IMPLEMENT THIS WORK AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS. ALWAYS A CONCERN HE'S REALLY STATE THESE ARE THESE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE OTHER POLLUTION BURDEN FOR LAST THING YOU WANT TO START. YOU KNOW PUT A NICE SHINY BALL ON SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY HARMFUL AND SO. I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSCORE THAT PARTICULAR. IT'S NICE KNOW THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS OR GETTING DOWN TO THE MINUTIA ON WHETHER THE REPORT SHE GO TO THE SECRETARY OF EPA OR TO COME TO US I MEAN THAT'S- IF THAT'S OUR BIGGEST DIFFERENCE THAN THAT YOU KNOW- I'M I'M- I'M FEELING-OKAY. ABOUT THAT ARE ARE ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES- LET'S SEE. KALRA WHO- MR SECRETARY I SEE YOUR HAND UP I GOT TO PAY ATTENTION AND HANDS ALL RIGHT. PLEASE I THANK YOU CHAIR- JUST THREE THINGS THAT THAT IT HAD AS WE ARE TALKING- I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT BASIC POINT IS THE ONLY REMAINING PLACES FOR THEM TO BUILD NEW SCHOOLS ARE BROWN KILLS THE CURRENTLY NOT CLEANED UP SO JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT. THE SCALE WITHIN THAT- VERY VERY LARGE METROPOLIS LIKE LA THE OPPORTUNITIES STILL IF YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A NEW SCHOOL IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ON A BROWNFIELD. WE'LL HAVE PARTLY IN THE SHADOW OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ON EXIDE- AND THAT COSTS ARE ASTRONOMICAL- IF WE DON'THAVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND AT A FUNCTIONING DGSE THAT CAN HOLD. POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE I'M SO MAKING SURE ALL THAT THAT WE HAVE THAT STRUCTURE IN PLACE. IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY SAVES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE STATE AND THAT TO ANGIE'S POINT. AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- AT THE MOMENT WAS SUBSIDIZING INDUSTRY. I'M IN THIS INTERVENING PERIOD SO THAT THEY REALLY IS ADAM C. TO GETTING THIS DONE AND THEN. THE FINAL THING THAT I'LL SAY SOME OF THESE. YEAH WE HAVE AS A STATE UNFORTUNATELY DECIDED TO NOT LOOK BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE CLEANUP SAYS. YEAH THE NUMBER OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IS IT'S ASTRONOMICAL I'M- BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM THE SACRAMENTO AREA- I'M OUT AND MINE. THE CLEANUP COSTS TO DATE HAS BEEN SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS DUMPING A TON OF ACID MINE DRAINAGE INTO THE SACRAMENTO RIVER EVERY SINGLE DAY SO WE HAVE A WET CAT OUT FOR US AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD CHAD TO WHAT YOU WAS SAYING WHICH IS. WE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY CLOSE TOGETHER- THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US ARE RESOLVABLE. IN IN MINUTES WEEKS AND REALLY A TEST TO THE SIDES COMING. OUR FRIENDS IN ASSEMBLY TO YOU'LL- AB CHAD AND TO THE DTS SEEING ARE TEAM AND- EVEN JUST LOOKING THE L. A. O. WANT TO GIVE COME. TO THE L. A. O. YOU KNOW MOSTLY WHAT WE COME IN WE SEE THE A. RIVER. THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF HAS BEEN. IN PRACTICE DALY BETWEEN US I WAS NINETY MY HEAD YEAH. THIS IS. MAINLY MAKING SENSE MAINLY IN CONCURRENT SO. WITH THIS MUCH AGREEMENT- I THINK WE NEED TO GET THIS OVER THE FINISH LINE AND ANYTHING THAT I CAN PERSONALLY DO ALL WE- IN THE ADMINISTRATION CAN DO TO SUPPORT THAT EFFORT IN THE LEGISLATURE. WE HAD WE HAD TO DO. YEAH APPROVE THE- APPROVED THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THAT THE FEES APPROVED THE OVERSIGHT NAY ABILITIES THE BOARD TO GRAPH THE ADJUSTMENTS. APPROVE THE MONEY RIGHT NOW IT'S A IT'S A VERY GOOD I HAVE NO OTHER MEMBERS IN THE ROOM- CENTER STERN I DON'T SEE YOUR. HE'S VERY AND I SEE THAT YOU THE HERE WELCOME GOOD MORNING- I HAVE NOTHING ELSE IF ANYBODY- HAS NOTHING TO ADD I WILL DO MY BEST TO- GET THIS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE FOR OFFICE HE SAID THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE. IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE- I'M ALMOST PREPARE TO DO IT TODAY BUT I WON'T- WE WILL. WE WILL- WE'LL WAIT. AND CENTER STERN YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD. AND LIGHT OF THE TESTIMONY RECEIVED TODAY AND ALL THE WONDERFUL STAFF WORK AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL AND WE JUST WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE STAFF HERE THAT. I'LL I'LL TAKE SOME OF THAT BURDEN WITH YOU- WE HAVE TO GET THIS DONE THIS YEAR. AND- IF WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT. THIS IS THE YEAR TO FINALLY TACKLE THESE ISSUES AND SO- STANDING WITH YOU SEE NOT TO TAKE THIS ALL ON YOUR OWN. READY TO GO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY WE WILL. OPEN IT LEAVE IT OPEN LEAVE THE MATTER OPEN WILL HAVE COMMENTS AT THE END FOR PEOPLE ON ON THE PUBLIC COMMENTS SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. WHICH WILL BE. THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN ON DROUGHT SAFE DRINKING WATER WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY. AND REPAIR ASSISTANCE. AND WE HAVE MISTER BROWN FROM THE L. A. O. TO- WITH RESOURCES I'M SORRY- MANAGER JONES. ARE YOU HERE. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER RIDE SHARE AND MEMBERS JEANINE JOHNSON DROUGHT MANAGER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WE HAVE A BACKGROUND POWER POINT FOR YOU TODAY I WOULD LIKE YOU TO WALK YOU THROUGH ON THE- AND NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCIES REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON OUR LAST DROUGHT AND THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT. SO IF WE ARE READY TO GO I WILL- DIVE INTO THAT OKAY. PLEASE. OKAY SELL- WE WERE PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED TO PROVIDE THIS REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED FROM OUR LAST DROUGHT AND AS BACKGROUND DROUGHTS ARE NOT A NEW THING IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A RECURRING FEATURE OF OUR CLIMATE SYSTEM AND WE'VE HAD QUITE A BIT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THEM OUR LAST STATEWIDE DROUGHT A SIGNIFICANCE WAS RELATIVELY RECENT. TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN AND IN THIS DROUGHT WE HAD A COUPLE OF WATER YEARS IN PARTICULAR THAT WERE REALLY- QUITE HYDROLOGICALLY SEVERE AND POINTED OUT THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT DOM. I. CHANGING CONDITION WITH RESPECT TO SEEING THE INFLUENCE OF WARMING TEMPERATURES SUCH AS RECORD LOW SNOWPACK IN A WILDFIRE SEASON THAT IS NOW ARE BECOMING ALMOST YEAR ROUND THAT DROUGHT WAS ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY FIRST TIME EVER ZERO ALLOCATIONS TO THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT AGRICULTURAL CUSTOMERS IN THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEYS WHICH CREATED A LOT OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDWATER PUMPING- CAUSING SIGNIFICANT LANDSLIDES AFFECTING SOME OF OUR WATER SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALSO- CAUSING A LOT OF WATER RIGHTS ADMINISTRATION CHALLENGES FOR OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD BECAUSE NATURAL FLOWS. WERE SO LOW AT THE TIME. SO WE LOOK AT AS DIRECTED IN THE LEGISLATION THE NUMBER OF- AREAS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE DROUGHT AND SOME OF THE THINGS. WE DID DURING THIS DROUGHT REFLECTING THE MAJOR FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THAT WE HAD A STATEWIDE PROCLAMATION OF DROUGHT EMERGENCY. AND ALSO THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT THE STATE REQUIRED MANDATORY URBAN WATER USE REDUCTIONS ALSO THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAD WIDESPREAD STATE ASSISTANCE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES IMPACTS RELATED TO DROUGHT ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATING FROM THE LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL JOBS. IN THE US CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE IMPACT OF THAT ON COMMUNITIES THAT WERE VERY DEPENDENT ON AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT. SO I AS IS NORMAL WHEN WE HAVE MULTI YEAR DROUGHTS WE SEE RESPONSE ACTIONS ONE THE VERY SIGNIFICANT ONES IN THE LAST ROUTE WAS THE ENACTMENT OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT OR SIGMA WHICH REQUIRES. THAT LOCAL AGENCIES BRING GROUNDWATER BASINS INTO LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE CONDITIONS AS WELL AS NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND IMPORTANTLY BEGINNING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. AND DATA COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON PRIVATE WELLS WHO ARE AFFECTED EARLIEST AND NORMALLY TO THE GREATEST EXTENT BY DROUGHT OUR LARGE URBAN WATER PURVEYORS- TEND TO HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE CAPACITY TO DO- WELL AND PREPARE FOR MULTI YEAR DROUGHTS. THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING FOR THE SMALL SYSTEM WORLD AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THE- YOU PROVISIONS PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO DEAL WITH THAT INCLUDING THE FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH THE SAFER. ACT AND THE USE OF MANDATORY CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY TO CONNECT US STRUGGLING SMALL SYSTEMS OR GROUPS OF DISADVANTAGED JOB PRIVATE WELL OWNERS FOR EXAMPLE TO PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED IN THE LAST DROUGHT. BIG LESSON WAS TO BEGIN TO SOON IN IS SLOW A CONDITION AS COMPARED TO THINGS LIKE EARTHQUAKES OR WILDFIRES AND IT PROVIDES A LONG LEAD TIME FOR STATE THE AGENCY RESPONSE ACTIONS THESE ACTIONS TEND TO TAKE TIME BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE THINGS LIKE- CONTRACTING FOR RESOURCES PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE COULD TO COMMUNITIES. ON DOING THE LONG TERM PLANNING TO ADMINISTER WATER RIGHTS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE ARE ALREADY PUTTING INTO PRACTICE AS WE LOOK AT THE DRY CONDITIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING NOW. SO CERTAINLY THE WATER RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO SPEAKS TO THE ART LONG TERM IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES FOR- WATER SUPPLY AND DROUGHT RESILIENCE CONDITIONS ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE PROGRESS IN OTHER AREAS SUCH AS- UP REPAIRED MISSED FOR WILDFIRE AND LOOKING AT THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HE CAN DO TO BETTER BE PREPARED TO HELP WITH THE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. SO- AMONG OUR MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM INVESTING IN IMPROVING OUR DATA INPUT AND FORECASTING INFRASTRUCTURE. ONE OF THE- LESSONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN PRIOR DROUGHTS IS THIS ISSUE OF FUN. THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING LONGER LEAD TIME TO RESPOND AND YOU GET THAT LONGER LEAD TIME BY IMPROVING FORECASTING. ALSO MAKING ADVANCE- MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR OUTREACH COMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITIES AND IMPORTANTLY SOME OF THE WORK THAT CAL FIRE HAS DONE IN PARTNERING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS FOREST MANAGEMENT CONDITIONS. ON NOW THE FEDERAL LANDS WHICH MAKE UP SO MUCH OF OUR WATERSHEDS IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHERE ARE WE TODAY WELL I HATE TO SAY IT'S LOOKING LIKE DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN BUT WE ARE HAVING VERY DRY CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW. THE IS PURSE. OF AVERAGE. SO WE ARE YOU KNOW EXPECTING TO SEE SOME SIMILAR CONDITIONS AS WE EXPERIENCED THEM. AND IN TERMS OF OUR CURRENT RESPONSE TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS WE ARE- RAMPING UP SOME ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED AS THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND THEN HE BOB PRIOR DROUGHT AND AT THIS POINT I WOULD. LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER TO MY TWO COLLEAGUES FROM THE WATER BOARD WHO ARE ALSO ON THIS ZOOM MEETING AND ASK IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT THEIR- LESSONS LEARNED WITH RESPECT TO WATER RIGHTS ADMINISTRATION AND- DRINKING WATER ESPECIALLY FOR ROCK. OF SMALL COMMUNITIES. SURE I CAN JUMP IN FIRST THANK YOU I'M I WISH THE NEWS WERE BETTER BUT THANK YOU FOR THE FOR COMPLETE REPORT. YES CHAMPION. YES ON THEIR PLANES ON W. DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE EARLY ACTIONS WERE TAKING- TO TRY TO GET A HANDLE ON WORKING WATER SYSTEMS ARE AT. AS A MISS JONES MENTIONED IT REALLY IS- IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS LARGELY ENDS UP BEING A SMALL SYSTEM IMPACT- THERE THE LEAST ABLE TO TAKE THIS- IMPACT ON ON TOP OF A- COVERED FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS- WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THEY PROCEED. WE ARE WORKING TO TRY TO ADDRESS AND UNDERSTAND WHERE WATER SYSTEMS ARE AT ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST DROUGHT WAS A LOT OF SMALL WATER SYSTEMS DON'T ACTIVELY. MONITOR THEIR WELL DEPTHS OR THEIR INTAKE THE LEVEL OF THEIR INTAKE AND RESERVOIRS WERE- WORKING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE SECURE THAT INFORMATION AND CAN MONTEREY ALONG WITH THEM THAT WE'RE PROCEEDING IN A WAY TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE'S A CRISIS COMING BEFORE WE GET THE CALL AT FOUR THIRTY FRIDAY AFTERNOON THAT THE OTHER OUT OF WATER AND THEY YOU KNOW NEED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FROM US OR OTHERS TO TRY TO GET THEM BACK IN. SERVICE AND WHAT START FROM YOUR FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT IS THAT STARTED IN THE RAINY SEASON'S OVER RIGHT SO WOULD THAT BE. WITH THAT THEY WAIT TILL JUNE TODAY START MONITORING IMMEDIATELY I MEAN WE'VE GOT. 50% LESS THAN 50% WATER. PRECIPITATION NOT TO AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE LAW LEVELS TO RECOVER. THE DROUGHT SO THERE ALREADY A STRESS CONDITIONS THE MANTRA NEEDS TO BEGIN NOW- AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE GATHER THAT INFORMATION FROM THEM- AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PERFORMED THAT MONITORING SO THAT THEY'RE ALSO AWARE. OF THEIR CURRENT CONDITION. THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO MENTION AS WELL IS THAT. A LOT OF OUR WATER SYSTEMS HAVE BACKUP SUPPLIES- IN IN RECENT TIMES AS MANY OF THOSE SUPPLIES WERE WELL THAT WERE ACTIVE BUT THEY TOOK. OFF OF ACTIVE STATUS DUE TO. WATER QUALITY CONTAMINATION FROM. ONE TWO THREE T. C. P. OR FROM P. BASS COMPOUNDS THAT WE'RE NOW FINDING. IN MANY OF OUR SOURCES. AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH WATER SYSTEMS AS WELL- WILL PRIORITIZE FROM OUR ACTION. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS IT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO- PERMIT US SOURCES AND GET WATER QUALITY TREATMENT ON THOSE SYSTEMS BEFORE THEY ARE. NECESSARY TO BRING BACK ON LINE. AND THAT OBVIOUSLY INVOLVES INVESTMENT ON THEIR PART AND OUR PART FROM OUR FUNDING PROGRAMS. INTO A PERMITTING ACTIVITY SO WE'RE REACHING OUT TO THOSE SYSTEMS WE NOW HAVE THAT. SCENARIO AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY PROGRESSED NOW IT'S YOU KNOW CONSTRUCTION'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT AND THE BEST OF TIMES IT'S HORRIBLE. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO RUSSIA AND WE KNOW MATERIALS AND OTHER THINGS ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND IN THE CURRENT CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENT SO WE NEED TO. MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE WHO WATER SYSTEMS UNDERSTANDS. IMPERATIVE TO BEGIN THAT ACTION NOW. IN FINDING ALL MEANT IS A WE'RE ALL TAKING EARLIEST TO MAKE SURE WE WORK. WITH OUR DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS AS THEY- RECEIVE INTO CARTEL MEN'S LAST TIME THERE IN THE LAST DROUGHT WE HAD TWENTY TWO WATER SYSTEMS. WHERE WE ISSUED A FOLLOW ON BUILDING MORATORIUM. AFTER CURTAILMENT WAS ISSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T CONTINUE TO ADD WATER DEMANDS TO THEIR SYSTEM AS THEIR WATER SYSTEM WAS CURTAILED. HOPEFULLY ALL THE SYSTEMS OF NOW AND PART OF ARE RELEASING HIM FROM THAT. MORATORIUM WASN'T THEY DID SECURE ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES AND MOST OF THE WATER SYSTEMS WERE ABLE TO. TO DO THAT WELL NOW UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A CHANCE TO TEST OUT HOW. HOW VIABLE AND NOW WERE THEY ABLE TO GET THOSE ALL IN PLACE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND THAT'S A GOOD. HAND UP POINT FOR- YEAH DIRECTOR ACTOR. FOLLOWING ME FROM OUR WATER RIGHTS DIVISION. THANKS ALL AND HOPEFULLY EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME THANK YOU FOR. HAVING US HERE TODAY AND- THANK YOU THE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS MY NAME IS ARGHA ACT ON THE W. DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS AT THE STATE WATER BOARD. AND THEY JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP TO BOTH WHAT JEAN HIGHLIGHTED AS WELL AS DIFFERENT- KIND OF ONGOING LESSONS LEARNED AND CHALLENGES FROM THE LAST DROUGHT JEAN HIGHLIGHTED IN THE- POWER POINT A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE. LOOKING AT KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE DROUGHT THE- EXPERIENCE OF DOING CURTAILMENTS IN THE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN TIME PERIOD WE ISSUED ABOUT NINE THOUSAND NOTICES OF WATER UNAVAILABILITY TO. WATER RIGHT HOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BY ANDY. THE EXPERIENCE OF TRYING TO CALCULATE AND DETERMINE WHEN THOSE CURTAILING NOTICES WERE NEEDED. AND THEN TRACKING AND KIND OF RESPONDING TO THEM IN LOOKING AT. HOW WE LOOK AT WATER AVAILABILITY KIND OF IN GENERAL THROUGHOUT. LOTS OF DIFFERENT WATER BASINS AND WATERSHEDS IN THE STATE. WAS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND RELIED ON SOME OLDER AND OUT OF DATE DATA. THE PRIOR TO SB EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH WAS PASSED IN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WATER DIVERTERS ONLY REPORTED ABOUT ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS. AND THEN THERE WERE SOME CHANGES MADE DURING THE LAST DROUGHT TO UPDATE THAT FREQUENCIES NOW IT'S NEARLY. BUT WE'RE STILL RELYING ON DATA THAT SUBMITTED SOMETIMES EIGHTEEN OR MORE MONTHS AFTER THE FACT AND IT. THERE ARE SOME. CHALLENGES IN THE STATE'S WATER RATES DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM HOW THAT INFORMATION IS REPORTED HOW IT'S YOU A OR OR QUALITY CHECKED ESSENTIALLY. MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO RESPOND QUICKLY OR EVEN TRACK WHERE WATER IS BEING USED ON A THEY WERE CLOSE TO REAL TIME BASIS AND WEBER FINDING DURING. THIS YEAR AS WELL AS OTHER DRY CONDITIONS IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT ACTUALLY TO TRACK WHERE THINGS ARE GOING AND WATER USE AND WATER AVAILABILITY A MUCH MORE KIND OF GRANULAR AN UP TO DATE TIME FRAME. SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED ARE THAT WE DO NEED KIND OF INVESTMENTS IN. OUR WATER RATES SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THE- THE STATE'S WATER RATE RECORDS ARE ALL HELD IN PAPER FILES IN- A STORAGE ROOM IN THE KELLY PA BUILDING IN SACRAMENTO. AND SO VIEW THAT ON ITS OWN RAISES CHALLENGES ABOUT EVEN HOW STAFF CAN ACCESS THE DATA PARTICULARLY DURING COPING TIMES AND- OTHER PUBLIC ACCESS IS THAT DATA AS WELL MAKES IT JUST DIFFICULT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHO OWNS A WATER RATE WHAT- WHAT RATE IS AVAILABLE TO WHOM WHERE IT'S BEING USED WHEN IT'S BEING USED. AND HOW DO YOU INTEGRATE THAT KIND OF A WATERSHED SCALE. TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE VOLUNTARY APPROACHES TO BETTER WATER MANAGEMENT OR GREATER WATER EFFICIENCY. SO I THINK WITH THAT ALL. OUR STUFF AND HEADED BACK TO JUNIOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ONE WHEN WE HOLD QUESTIONS FOR A SECOND AND BEFORE I RECOGNIZE FINANCE I WANT TO TAKE A- COUPLE MINUTE BREAK- IF YOU GUYS CAN PAUSE AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK SO DON'T GO ANYWHERE. DO YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE- AND THANK YOU WATER RESOURCE BOARD FINANCED YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE BEFORE WE TURNED IT OVER TO PRESENTATION TO THE L. L. DR OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I JUST COUPLE POINTS I KNOW THE AGENDA HAS A CHORE OF EXPENDITURES MADE- APPROPRIATIONS MADE IN THE LAST DROUGHT- JUST COUPLE THINGS KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW SAID SEN THE LAST RATHER HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT- WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT HE PRIMARILY THROUGH PROPOSITION ONE AND PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT WHICH YOU KNOW. RIDER POSSIBLY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN DIFFERENT- WATER PROJECT INVESTMENT- SENT THE- MADE A LOT OF THINGS EVIDENCE IN THEY BREAKING WATER AND I THINK WITH A PASSAGE OF SB TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINETEEN WAS. RIDING A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- ONGOING ANNUALLY. TO SUPPORT THAT EFFORT. AND EVEN IN THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT BUDGET THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT THAT WE DO THINK THAT COULD SUPPORT DURING- YOU KNOW DROUGHT TIMES OTHER THING I'LL GIVE NO QUICKLY IS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR DID RECENTLY RELEASED- I THINK I COULD HAVE ORDER ON RALPH. AND PART OF THE DIRECTOR. REYES TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT- TRY TO ACCELERATE- FUNDING- WORK. REPURPOSE THE SOME FIVE BOND FUNDING- WE KNOW WHEN POSSIBLE AND AVAILABLE AND ALSO LOOK AT POTENTIAL OTHER. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE IN THE MAYOR VISION WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING THROUGH. THANK YOU ABOUT THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IN ONE YEAR BUT THAT'S IT WAS HE WHO THERE IS- NECESSARY INVESTMENTS WELL. MISS EHLERS GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON I GUESS IT IS WELCOME- IN. PLEASE PROCEED WITH THE PRESENTATION ON THE- THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN ON DROUGHT AND SAFE DRINKING WATER THANK YOU SENATOR AND- AND MEMBERS NICE TO SEE YOU GOOD AFTERNOON FOR OUR RETAILERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- IF I COULD I'LL JUST MAKE A COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS AHEAD BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE PACKAGE MORE GENERALLY ON DROUGHT AND WE KNOW THAT. THERE IS A PACKAGE THAT YOU ARE DISCUSSING TODAY BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE- NEGOTIATIONS WILL CONTINUE IN DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE SAID JUST A FEW POINTS WE THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS THOSE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE- FIRST AS THE ADMINISTRATION PRESENTED THINGS ARE LOOKING PRETTY BAD- THUS FAR. I DILIGENTLY- SO ONE OF THE BIG LESSONS WE LEARNED DURING THE LAST DROUGHT IS THINKING ABOUT BEING PROACTIVE RATHER THAN REACTIVE WE ARE LUCKY THAT WE HAVE THESE LESSONS LEARNED THAT SILVER LINING I GUESS OF WHAT WE WENT THROUGH A FEW YEARS AGO SO IT'S GREAT THEY'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION TODAY AND REALLY THINKING STRATEGICALLY ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO GET AHEAD OF. OF CONDITIONS ARE WORSENING. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CHART ON PAGE TWENTY SIX OF YOUR AGENDA YOU'LL SEE WE DID. SPEND THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OVER THAT FOUR YEAR PERIOD DURING THAT THE LAST DROUGHT IN DROUGHT RESPONSE. BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT THE OF THE BOOK OF IT WAS IN THAT FIRST CATEGORY WATER SUPPLY THAT WAS MOSTLY SUPPORTED BY BONDS. AND THOSE ARE MOSTLY LONGER TERM- PROJECTS SO THEY REALLY DIDN'T RESPOND TO THAT. THE LAST DROUGHT BECAUSE FUNDS TAKE AWHILE TO GET OUT THE DOOR THE PROJECTS TAKE A WHILE TO FINANCE AND PERMIT AND SO HOPEFULLY THOSE WILL HELP US IN THIS NEW DROUGHT THAT WE'RE FACING. BUT AS YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR PACKAGE THINKING ABOUT BALANCING KIND OF IMMEDIATE NEAR TERM RESPONSE TO PRESSING SITUATIONS AS COMPARED TO LONGER TERM RESILIENCE BOTH ARE IMPORTANT- BUT THOSE BIGGER LONGER TERM PROJECTS WON'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS IMMEDIATE NEEDS. AND THEN ALSO GLAD LEASE TO HAVE CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT FUND SOURCE AND- AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE USE MOSTLY BOND. AND MANY SUFFERED FOR THOSE BIG PROJECTS LAST TIME AND THOSE TAKE AWHILE WE REALLY DID RELY ON GENERAL FUND AND IN SOME CASES SPECIAL FUNDS FOR SOME OF THOSE IMMEDIATE. EMERGENCY RESPONSE WATER CONSERVATION ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. ACTIVITIES YOU SEE IN THAT CHART. AND ANOTHER THING THAT ABOUT A BALANCE THE HUMOR NEED OF DROUGHT IMPACTS AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS THE STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES INCLUDING FISH AND WILDLIFE AND- AND WATERWAYS. AND THOSE THAT HAD SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS DURING THE LAST DROUGHT SO MAKING SURE AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT CONSTRUCTING ANY FUNDING PACKAGE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE. CATEGORIES WE NEED. AND THEN EVEN WITHIN THE HUMAN NEEDS. I'M THINKING ABOUT IN PARTICULAR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THE LAST DURING THE LAST DROUGHT AS WAS MENTIONED RURAL FARM WORKER COMMUNITIES REALLY- EXPERIENCE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS NOT ONLY FROM FROM LOSS OF DRINKING WATER BUT ALSO ECONOMIC IMPACTS FROM LOSS OF JOBS FROM. AGRICULTURAL AT PRODUCTION SLOWDOWN SO THINKING ABOUT HOW THE STATE CAN HELP THOSE. WHO TO TARGET AID TO THOSE WHO MIGHT NEED IT MOST. AND THEN FINALLY AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WE PUT OUT A RECORD ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO ON THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. WHICH IS THAT KIND OF A NEW COMPLICATING FACTOR IS A FAR STATE BUDGET PROCESS WASN'T COMPLICATED ENOUGH NOW WE'VE GOT A NEW FACTOR- THAT PROBABLY IS GOING TO COME INTO PLAY AND- PLAY SOME CONSTRAINTS ON ON STATE SPENDING AND STATE GENERAL FUND SPENDING PROCEEDS OF TAXES. I'M NOT ONLY IN THE COMING BUDGET BUT IN THE COMING YEAR SO IT'S PRETTY TECHNICAL AND WE COULD HAVE A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS HAVE IT BUT WE JUST WANT TO HAVE THAT ON YOUR RADAR AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. THE PACKAGE THAT THERE IS THE KIND OF THIS NEW LEVEL OF COMPLICATION- AND THEN THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT COUNT TOWARDS THE LIMIT AND SOMETIMES OF EXPENDITURES THAT DON'T COUNT SOWE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AS YOU. WORK THROUGH YOUR YEAR BUT OVERALL BUDGET PACKAGE BUT THAT'S JUST ANOTHER. ISSUE TO HAVE ON YOUR RADAR I HAVE THATCOPY OF IT ON MY DESK AND I HAVE CRACKED THE SEAL ON IT BUT IT WAS A- IT'S SPECIAL READING. SO BEFORE WE GET INTO THE YOU KNOW BASICALLY IF YOU LOOK IF YOU TAKE OUT THE BOND MONEY FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY. SEVENTEEN FOR THOSE FOUR YEARS WE PLAYED. SPENCER NORTH OF BILLION. OVER EVERY. OVER THE FOR YEARS WHICH IS A- A QUARTER FOR THE- BILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS TO BE TAKE OUT TO. THE MONEY TO THE WATER JUST SIX FOR THE- THE FEDERAL FUNDING BUT WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER FEDERAL FUNDS. GENERAL FUNDS AND- ANY SCRAPES OF MONEY THAT'S LEFT FROM THE BONDS YOU KNOW SIXTY EIGHT AND ONE. SO THIS IS RICK THIS IS REAL MONEY THIS IS NOT. MIDDLE PROBLEM AND WE'RE GOING TO FINANCE IT SO THAT'S- YOU GIVE ME SOME IDEA OF THE OF THE IMPACT OF PAINT SPENDING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND TWO HUNDRED AND- TWO POINT FIVE BILLION. NOW OR IN A LOT ABOUT THIS TEN TIMES AS MUCH FOR ALL THESE THINGS THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS POINTED OUT THAT WERE SORT OF LESSONS LEARNED COMMUNITY. SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA. YEAH THERE ARE CERTAINLY NEEDS CERTAINLY NEEDS AND AGAIN ACTING EARLY AHEAD OF WHEN- CONDITIONS WORSEN I THINK- AGAIN EMPHASIZING HOW MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES YOU WANT TO FUND OUR KIND OF IMMEDIATE AND WILL WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE NEXT YEAR TO VERSUS HOW MANY WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT SUBSEQUENT DRUG BOTH ARE IMPORTANT IT'S JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE AREAS OF FOCUS AND EVEN IF YOU PUT ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS EVEN IF YOU PUT A LOT OF FUNDING OUT IN ONE YEAR THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT WILL BE SPENT IN THAT YOU'RE PARTICULARLY FOR SOME OF THE LONGER TERM- PROJECTS SO IT'S BALANCING KIND OF THAT IMMEDIATE NEED. A LONGER TERM NEED AND ALSO HOW WHAT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ON A ON A QUICK BASIS VERSUS THAT WILL TAKE LONGER. OKAY HI CLIFFORD IT THOSE ARE. THREE GENERAL. IDEAS TO KEEP IN MIND ON ON DROUGHT. HELLO WHAT ARE YOU PROCEED WITH THE MAIN ATTRACTION- SO YES STAFF HAVE ASKED US TO PRESENT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU JUST ONE OF THEM REITERATE THIS IS NOT AN ALLEY- PROPOSAL ARE IN LA- PACKAGE WE ARE JUST BE I'M SERVING AS YOUR STAFF TO PRESENT SO IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS MEMBER HAVE MEMBERS HAVE ABOUT THAT PACKAGE- PROBABLY BEST TO DIRECT THEM TOWARDS COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR STAFF BUT I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT. SO THE PACKAGE BEFORE YOU IS THREE POINT FOUR- ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS AND I'LL GO THROUGH THAT AT A HIGH LEVEL THAT CATEGORIES ARE THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE FOR WATER IN DROUGHT RELIEF. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR EMERGENCY DROUGHT WATER USE EFFICIENCY PROJECTS. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD BE GRANTS TO IMPLEMENT THE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT SICK MATH AS WELL AS- FOR SOME OTHER GROUND WATER RELATED ACTIVITIES. TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR RESILIENT WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR RECYCLED WATER PROJECTS. TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT. TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION FOR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD HELP PROTECT FISH AND WILDLIFE FROM DROUGHT IMPACTS. ONE HUNDRED MILLION FOR WATER QUALITY ACTIVITIES. SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR VARIOUS- ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE WATER DATA AND FORECASTING. AND THEN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP REPAIRS COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS WASTEWATER TREATMENT WORKS AND PUBLIC UTILITIES RECOVER FROM THE IMPACTS OF THE FAT COATED- PANDEMIC COULD NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I AND THEN FINALLY THE PACKAGE ALSO INCLUDES LANGUAGE TO ACCELERATE APPROPRIATION OF EXISTING WATER BOND PRIORITIES FROM PROPOSITION ONE AND PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT WHERE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE AND DEMAND IS HIGH. AND ALSO TO URGE THE WATER COMMISSION TO CONVENE AND REALLOCATE ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION IN EXISTING PROPOSITION ONE FUNDS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY SET ASIDE FOR THE TEMPERANCE FLAT DAM TO USE FOR OTHER SUSTAINABLE WATER STORAGE INVESTMENTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND WE SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THAT THAT IS HIS IS A SUGGESTION FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE WATER BOARD WHEN THEY RECONVENE IT'S NOT AT THAT IS NOT TO BE INTERPRETED THE BUDGET ITEM PER SE- AND JUST. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S MONEY SITTING THERE. WHAT DO WE GET TO ASK QUESTIONS IN OR LATER WOULD. LET HER GET THROUGH OKAY. AND THAT CONCLUDES THE PRESENTATION OF THE PACKAGE. CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU GOOD TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. OKAY SO I HAVE A SO I AS SOMEBODY WHO- PARTICIPATED IN PROP ONE AND NEGOTIATED HEAVILY TO GET THE BILL ACTUALLY OUT OF OFF THE FLOOR TO GET IT TOO- THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOTE ON. WE LOOKED. AT TEMPERANCE FLAT WE LOOKED AT- SITES RESERVOIR AND HERE WE ARE NOW SIX YEARS LATER AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL NOT DOING THOSE PROJECTS AS WERE SOLD TO THE VOTERS- AS- BASICALLY EARMARKS IN THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD THEY THEY WERE PRIORITY THAT WE HAD WE HAD TO SELL. THAT THOSE RESOURCES FIRST FOR STORAGE SO THE ONE FORTY FIVE- I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT SHOULD STAY IN THE PROP. IN IN THE BOND MONEY TO GO TO THOSE PROJECTS AND COULD YOU IDENTIFY WHAT OTHER PROJECTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- THAT YOU WOULD BE LOOKING OUT WITH THAT MONEY AND- THERE SEEMS TO BE. A QUITE A BIT OF- RESOURCES AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IN THIS PACKAGE. AND TO SIPHON SOME OFF OF PROP ONE WHICH THE VOTERS. DEFINITELY- PUSH FOR STORAGE- CAN YOU ANSWER THAT FOR ME PLEASE. I CAN. WELL THAT THAT WAS NELSON'S QUESTION L. LONGER GOING TO REFLECT IN THAT SO RIGHT SO AGAIN I'D FROM FROM THE SENATE POINT OF VIEW THIS IS A SUGGESTION WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SIR SOME MONIES IN THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT THEY JUST THEY THEY PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND MONEY HAS BEEN GONE BACK THERE WITH YOU MAKE THESE ESTIMATES ON ON THOSE THOSE THINGS SO IF ANY OF THOSE POTS OF MONEY. THAT ARE THERE OR HER. OTHER MADISON PEOPLE AREN'T THEY HAVE TO ACT HAVE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT TO THE THEIR THEIR DECIDED NOT TO COMPLETE THE PROJECTS A LOT OF WATER RESTORATION SO THE GOAL IS TO LOOK TO THE ALL THOSE PROPS TO SCRAPE UP EVERYTHING- RIGHT I DON'T I'M NOT DISPUTING PROP SIXTY EIGHT BUT IN PROP PROPOSITION ONE WE NEGOTIATED AND THAT CONTRACT THAT IT WAS GOING- IN THAT BILL THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE FOR STORAGE THAT'S HOW WE GOT ALL OF MOST OF THE REPUBLICAN VOTE CAME FROM THE FACT THAT. WE ACTUALLY. DESIGNATED IT FOR STORAGE AND- AND WE'RE NOT THERE WE SPENT A WHILE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE THOSE FUNDS DIVERT OFF I STILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE SITES RESERVOIR TEMPERANCE FLAT. FOR IT TO COME TO FRUITION SO THAT WE IT DURING THESE TIMES WE HAVE SEVERE DROUGHT WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME WATER AVAILABLE WELL I THINK I THINK THE GOAL WOULD BE NOT THAT YOU WOULD DIVERT IT FROM. INVESTMENTS IN AGRICULTURE AND GROUNDWATER STORAGE BECAUSE WE HAVE INTERVENING SIGMOD THAT IS HELPING OUT WATER DISTRICTS AND IF THE WATER BOARD DECIDES THAT THE NEED IS THERE I GET IS THAT C. IS JUST A SUGGESTION IT'S NOT. A LOT OF BUDGET ITEM RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S- THERE'S DROUGHT THEY MAY HAVE PRIORITIES THAT THEY SAY OKAY WE NED TO. WE NEED TO HELP OUT THIS AGRICULTURAL OF- ROGIC. I DON'T KNOW CENTER WAREHOUSE WAS OLDER. SUGGESTIONS TURN INTO. HAPPENINGS HERE AND THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY HEY. D. D. WOULD DO WE ARE YOU CAN MIX YOU CAN TALK ABOUT SEGMENT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS AND THEY'RE ALL PRIORITIES THERE'S A TON OF CARS OUT THERE. BUT WITHOUT CREATING MORE WATER WHICH IS WHAT PROP ONE WAS. WAS SOLD TO THE VOTERS AS- AND SOLD TO THE LEGISLATURE WHO PASSED THE LEGISLATION OUT HERE TO CREATE THE PROPOSITION. IN OUR DIVERTING THOSE FUNDS AWAY I WANT TO GO ON RECORD THAT I THINK THAT'S THE WRONG YOU SOME MONEY ALL RIGHT I THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE THAT MONEY THERE AND ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE ARE. THAT THE BOAT WHAT THE VOTERS. EXPECTED US TO DO WHICH WAS TO CREATE SOME STORAGE. SO I KNOW WHAT HOW IT WORKS HERE IT GOES TO THIS COMMITTEE. AND THEN IT GOES TO THE BIG THREE. PRETTY SOON. BECAUSE IT NOBODY STOOD UP AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT IT IT BECOMES. MAKING RECOVERY ALREADY IN IT AND IT HAPPENS. PROP SIXTY IT WAS A DIFFERENT SCENARIO PROP SIXTY EIGHT WAS ALL THE VOTERS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SO I'M TALKING ABOUT PROP ONE MONEY'S GOING TO. OTHER PLACES THAN STORAGE NO BUT THIS IS JUST THE RIVER THAT. THE WORDING THAT YOU'RE KEEN OFFICE IT'S- IF IT'S DIVERTED TO USE YOUR FOR. YOUR FIRM TO OTHER SUSTAINABLE WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO. IT MAY NOT GO TO. TEMPERS FLAT DAM BUT WILL GO TO OTHER WATER STORAGE FACILITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO. IT'S NOT THIS IS NOT- HIJACKING IS JUST SAYING. IF WE CAN IF WE CAN DO MORE GOOD IN OTHER PLACES I SEE MISS. BELARUS IS AT HAND THIS UP THAT'S ALL WE'RE LOOKING IS JUST. CREATIVELY FIFTY FOUR IF YOU GET MORE. WE WANT THAT PART TO STATE WERE THE VOTERS WANTED IT IN. WATER STORED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT'S- NOT DISPUTED WE'RE NOT DISPUTING THAT WOULD JUST SINK. IF THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT COME UP. BUT THAT'S IT THERE WAS TO IDENTIFY PROJECTS AND- IN PROP ONE AND TRUST ME I'M I'M VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT SITES IT'S OF. AWESOME PROJECT AND WE NEED TO BUILD AND DIVERSIFY IT IS IN THAT. IS IN THAT AS WELL. NOT TO DIVERT THAT MONEY AWAY FROM THOSE IS THE WRONG THING TO DO I'M JUST I. I THINK I'VE HEARD IT LET'S GO TO MISS. ELLERS AND IT WILL GO TO MISTER SINISTER AND. IN CENTER MCGUIRE- THANK YOU MISS CHAIR JUST AS UP OF CLEAR. SO PROP. WE INCLUDED A BIT OF FUNDING AND I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR THE MAGIC IT WAS ROUGHLY FOUR BILLION FOR WATER STORAGE. AND DEFERRED TO THE WATER COMMISSION TO DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT- ACROSS DIFFERENT PROJECTS THEY PICKED. SEVEN DIFFERENT PROJECTS FOR THAT- FOR INITIAL ALLOCATIONS- OF WHICH- THIS PROJECT WAS ONE. DIFFERENT ACCESS TEMPERANCE FLAT WAS ONE HOWEVER TEMPERANCE FLAT HAS SINCE DIED BY BELIEVE LAST OCTOBER WITHDRAWN FROM THE PROGRAMBECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE- SUFFICIENT FUNDING I THINK. THAT'S WHERE TIM TO MATCH THE STATE FUNDING SO- THIS FUNDING COULDN'T BE DIVERTED FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN WATER STORAGE WITHOUT GOING BACK TO THE VOTERS BECAUSE PROPOSITION ONE REQUIRES THAT IT BE IS FOR. FOR WATER STORAGE BUT IT'S REALLY UP TO THE WATER COMMISSION TO DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE CONSISTENT WITH BOND LANGUAGE ACROSS PROJECTS. AND I BELIEVE THAT TEMPERANCE FLAT IS NOW NOT WHEN IT HAD HAS WAS ORIGINALLY I HAVE. DECIDED BY THE WATER COMMISSION TO GET SOME AT FUNDING. BUT THEN HAS SINCE WITHDRAWN SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE FUNDS ARE STAR WAITING FOR A NEW ALLOCATION AT THIS POINT. WELL THEN LET ME SUGGEST. THAT YOU USE THOSE FUNDS. TO DESIGNATE THE PROJECTS THAT WE DESIGNATED. AND PROP ONE WHICH WAS- I THINK LIVES MAY BE LOST FOR CAROL'S I CAN'T REMEMBER WALL BUT I KNOW THAT SITE IS ONE OF THOSE AND I DON'T WANT TO THE POT IS ALREADY. DWINDLED DOWN TO WHERE WE CAN WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP US. WITH WITH THESE PROJECTS AND WE REALLY NEED TO BUILD A SOME POINT ONCE YOU. WAIT THE LONGER YOU WAIT NUMBER ONE BECAUSE INFLATION. HAPPENS AND YOU'VE YOU'VE- BOB PROBS WITH BILLIONS DOLLARS IT DOES MEET MANY BECAUSE IT YOU AFFORD TO BE. MIGHT IS I DON'T WANT THESE FUNDS SIPHONED OFF. TO PROJECTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN PROP ONE. AS PRIORITY PROJECTS. WE LINK. IN OUR- TO THE WATER COMMISSION. ON TO CONVENE AN TO REVIEW IT IF TEMPERED SLATS HAS WITHDRAWN THAT'S BEYOND OUR- OUR CONTROL. I'M FINE GO BUILD SITE. SENATOR STERN YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I PUT MY HAND DOWN HERE. COME THROUGH OKAY YES YES GO AHEAD RIGHT THANK YOU YEAH I WANT TO START OF BY THANK YOU A STAFF IN OUR LEAD. FOR YEAH AGAIN IN THE- THIS GESTURE- ON THE OF MOST- URGENT. TO OUR STATE- I'M NOT TRYING TO DO IS KEEP THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD OR EVEN- WAIT FOR EVERYTHING TO SHAKE OUT IN WASHINGTON BUT STARTING ON EARLY I PACK ON WHY IN NOW HE- ON THIS PACK WERE IN THE TODAY- WE'RE CHAU CA LEADERS. AT THE SCALE THAT I THIS CRY TO ME. AND YOU KNOW TO A IN SOME. WE RELY ON RECYCLED WATER LA IS IN FACT COMMITTED THIRTY FIVE- THE TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW 60% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION HAS TO GET CREATIVE ABOUT OUR RESOURCES SO I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT. A LOT OF ELEMENTS OF THIS PACKAGE I THINK OUR GROWERS ARE IN A REALLY TOUGH SPOT RIGHT NOW AND WE NEED TO MAKE SIGNAL WORK I THINK THE OPENING SALVOS WHEN IT COMES TO WATER RECYCLING AND- STORM WATER AND WATER QUALITY HERE A GOOD START- AND I WAS JUST HOPING WHILE WE HAD OUR EXPERTS HERE TODAY JUST TO DO IT A LITTLE BIT JUST TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF FEEDBACK AB STARTING WITH THE WATER BOARD. ABOUT THE SCOPE OF NEED SO THAT YOU KNOW THREE POINT FOUR BILLION MAY SOUND LIKE A LOT- BUT I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF ANALYSIS BEING DONE ON. NEEDS IN A FEW THESE AREAS IF YOU'D INDULGE ANSWER CHECK AND I ASKED THEM- OUR WATER BOARD IN TERMS OF. PROJECTS THAT- THEY'VE ALREADY ANALYZED. THAT SEEM TO ALIGN WITH OUR CRITERIA ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT SHOVEL READY WHERE IS THERE CONSENSUS WHERE'S THE PERMITTING WORK BEEN DONE- BUT REALLY JUST GIVE US A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. TO INFORM MARC ARE AND PROCESS GOING FORWARD PLEASE PROCEED I'M I'M SURE THE WATER POURED WOULD LOVE TO GIVE US A DETAILED LIST OF ALL TO SHOVEL READY PROJECTS PLEASE- IF. YOU'RE GOOD THANK YOU AND I DON'T YOU KNOW I YOU ALSO NEED TO BE EXHAUSTED BUT I WAS REVIEWING IT WE CAN JUST START WITH THAT AND- RECYCLED WATER I KNOW YOU YOU ALL HAVE DONE A SOME KIND OF ANALYSIS FOR. THE SCOPE OF FUNDED WILL PROJECTS- THIS YOU KNOW IN THIS NEXT YEAR TO. GIVE IT CAN YOU GIVE US OF WHAT WHAT THAT OVERALL NEEDED. OR OVERALL SORT OF A FEW KNOW WHAT'S FEASIBLE- AND FUND WILL PROJECT NEEDS. YEAH I I'VE GOT A QUICK LIST HERE I CAN RUN THROUGH. I WON'T LIST THE PROJECTS BUT JUST YOU KNOW ROLLING IT UP FOR YOU- WE HAVE- IN WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS WHICH WE LUMP TOGETHER IS WASTE WATER BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN LINKED TOGETHER. I TWO HUNDRED AND TWO PROJECTS ACCOUNTING FOR SIX POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION THAT ARE. IN SOME FORM OF APPLICATION AND READY TO PROCEED AND IN DIFFERENT FASHIONS ARE BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION- I CAN JUMP INTO JUST A COUPLE OTHERS WHILE IMAGINING I'M DRINKING WATER IS THAT IT IS THAT THE STATE. HERE OF THE OF THE RECYCLE PROJECTS ARE JUST THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT TOTAL COST YEAH I'M JUST LISTING THE TOTAL COST YEAR OF THE PROJECTS AS WE HAVE A MAN OF COURSE THEY'RE THEY'RE ESTIMATES THEY'RE NOT. SOLID NUMBERS FROM OF WHAT'S BEEN BAD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT THESE ARE. THESE ARE WHAT THE PROPONENTS OF THE PROJECTS OF INFORMED US- WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE LEVEL OF PROJECTS. IN ANY. IN MIND TOUCHING ON. I KNOW IT SO THAT'S RECESSED- THAT'S SORT OF WHAT YOU CALL WASTE WATER- I KNOW THE M. S. FOR PERMITTING PROCESS AND STORM WATER HAS BEEN A MAJOR. LIABILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND IS IT A BIG DEAL INTO ITSELF YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN THAT IN THE STORM WATER AND AS FOR READING. YES I DON'T KNOW THE THESE ARE ALL OF SPECIFICALLY MS FOR BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED FORTY THREE STORMWATER PROJECTS IN THE MOST LIKELY. LARGELY MS FOR A RELATED- THE TOTAL OF THAT WOULD BE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION OF THOSE OF PROJECT PROPOSALS WE RECEIVED. OKAY AND THEN THE LAST AREA WAS I WAS. THIS WAS NOT THE LAST YEAR I AM INTERESTED IN A LOT OF THIS BUT- BUT ON WATER QUALITY- ON THE SAFE DRINKING WATER SIDE I KNOW WE'VE GOT A ROBUST. PACKAGE YEAR ESPECIALLY ON THE- SOME OF THE COMMUNITY WATER NEEDS AND THAT ELEMENT BUT YOU HAVE A- IF YOU WERE TO SORT OF WRAP IN SAY- NOT JUST- THOSE WATER QUALITY ISSUES BUT LIKE THE BROADER GROUNDWATER CLEANUP ISSUES OUT THERE- I'M THINKING OF. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING FROM- THE YOU KNOW THE PROJECTS GOING ON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRY TO GREET CLEAN UP OUR AQUIFER'S THAT ARE UNDER WAY- BUT EVEN- THE DRINKING WATER FOUNTAINS IN SCHOOLS- THE LEAD. YOU KNOW LEAD AND OTHER HAZARDOUS- CONTAINMENT ISSUES GIVE A SENSE ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS ON THE BROADER WATER WATER QUALITY. YEAH LET ME START WITH GROUNDWATER GROUNDWATER- THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT MORE NEEDS I'M GONNA REPRESENT HERE THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT WE- AGAIN HAVE PROPOSALS AND HOUSING OR WORKING WITH. REP FOR PROJECTS CURRENTLY LISTED FOR SIXTY FOUR MILLION I KNOW PERSONALLY THAT DIED COULD BE EXTENDED DRAMATICALLY ESPECIALLY IN THE LA AREA IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AREA- KNOWING THAT THERE ARE THERE'S A LOT OF PROJECTS ARE GETTING LOCALLY FUNDED THERE AS WELL. ON THE DRINKING WATER SIDE IF WE JUST KIND OF LUMP TOGETHER ALL DRINKING WATER THAT WE KNOW OF THAT ARE PROJECTS AND IN YOU KNOW SOME AGAIN FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITH US. THAT'S TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT PROJECTS IN ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTED COSTS- FOR DRINKING WATER. GOT IT. I THANK YOU FOR THAT RUN THROUGH AND- ALL RIGHT I HOPE THAT THAT HELPS INFORM AT LEAST AT A HIGH LEVEL OUR DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD I WOULD UST SAY MISTER CHAIR. THE POINT I WOULD I WOULD MAKE IS WE HOPEFULLY MOVE THIS. BIG BOLD PACKAGE FORWARD TODAY- IS THAT. WE RECOGNIZING IN THESE AREAS ALONE NOT TO MENTION SAY SEGMENT LIMITATION. WHERE I KNOW THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF CAPACITY NEED- AND MAYBE. IN THE FUTURE IN THE AS WE GO FORTY WE CAN TOUCH ON- SORT OF WHAT THE GSA AND SOME OF THOSE OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT THE GROWERS ARE GOING TO BE FACING IN THOSE REGIONS. BUT EVEN IN THOSE AREAS ALONE- I'M HEARING. I MEAN WE'RE WELL OVER. TEN BILLION DOLLARS- SO. I WANT TO BE- STRAIGHT FORWARD WITH OUR- CALIFORNIA TO AND SAY YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO WE WANT TO PUT A BIG BIG INVESTMENT AND SUPERCHARGES WEEDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE BEHIND US ALL THE WAY WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF LAST NIGHT. WE KNOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A BIG PART TO PLAY IN THIS TO- BUT THEY'RE REALLY SCOPE THE NEED AND UNDERSTAND- HOW BIG WE'VE GOT TO GO SO I HOPE THAT THAT DOESN'T INTIMIDATE US BUT MAYBE BOYS OUR SPIRIT ST DIG TO KEEP GOING BIGGER SO THANKS FOR THE INDULGENCE IN AND MISTER CHAIR IF IT'S WORTH IT I WOULD- I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH ON THE SAME ISSUE TO GO I IMAGINE IT'LL COME UP IN TEST. MODE YEAH I MEAN I THINK YOU YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT IF. IF WE HAVE TEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS HANGING OUT THERE AND- WE'RE TWO AND A HALF SO IT'S A DOWN PAYMENT- CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR I WAS JUST GONNA GO BACK TO THAT THE ISSUE OF WHAT THE VICE CHAIR OF. THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE CENTER NIELSEN HAD REQUESTED THROUGH CENTER DOLLING IN GREATLY APPRECIATE THE CONCERN I THINK. THE CHALLENGE IS NUMBER ONE THIS COMMITTEE CAN'T CHANGE THE BOND MEASURE RIGHT IT'S CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO THE OTHER ISSUE. IS CENTER NIELSEN WILL ALSO HAVE THAT SECOND BITE AT THE APPLE WHEN I GO TO FULL BUDGET. SO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS WHERE-VICE CHAIR DOLLY- BUT JUST HAVE TO THE CONCERNED IN AND RESPECTED GREATLY. I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE THE FIRST OF ANOTHER. LONGER CONVERSATION AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS INTO A CHAIR MAKOWSKI IS MATH. THAT WE WOULD SEE ALSO AT THE LARGER BUDGET COMMITTEE WHEN A RECOMMENDATION WOULD COME FORWARD TO THIS. I'D FROM BUDGET SAID TO THE LARGER BUDGET COMMITTEE WHERE SENATOR NELSON BEARDED CHIME IN DIRECTLY ON AS WELL I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. AGAIN GRATEFUL FOR ADVISED HER DOLLAR FOR DANCING COMES- THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT MANY FOR. WILL BE REVIEWING THE ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS AND SCRUBBING IT LET'S GO BACK TO CENTER DOLLY. I WANT TO JUST MAKE A COMMENT FIRST OFF I WANTED TO. FOR THE FOR THE I. T. WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE- IN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WHAT WERE WE HAVE WATER RIGHTSBASICALLY ON PAPER STILL I AM ALL IN. I'M NOT I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF FAITH AS YOU AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE BEEN CRITICAL OF. THE WORK WE'RE ABLE TO DO IN THE I. T. AREA FOR SOME REASON WHEN YOU LOOK AT EDT IN THE DMV WE HAVE WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY AND BUT WE DON'T GET. A GOOD PRODUCT OUT SO I'M HOPEFUL. ONCE AGAIN WE'RE WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND DGSE IN THE SAME COMMITTEE- EARLIER THIS YEAR. SO I WANT TO SEE IS GET INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY HERE WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY SO THAT PEOPLE ESPECIALLY NOW WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T GET INTO ACCESS THINGS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. STREAMLINED THE PROCESS SO I WANT TO. JUST SHARE THAT. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THAT. YEAH THE THING I WANTED TO BRING UP IS THAT- I AS A AS SOMEBODY WHO IS A FARMER AND- I'M NOT SEEN A DRYER YOU'RE IN MY LIFETIME. THIS EARLY ON. AND I THINK THAT- I KNOW THAT THIS PROCESS HAS IT TAKES TIME WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW GO THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT- WE HAVE SOME EARLY ACTION ITEMS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON HERE AND WHEN I SAY THAT- THAT FOR EVERY. DAY OR WEEK THAT WE WAIT IN GETTING MONEY ON THE GROUND IT'S DAY IT'S DAYS AND WEEKS THAT THERE'S EVAPORATION HAPPENING ON OUR SOILS- IN SOME THESE WATER DISTRICT IS QUITE FRANKLY NEED SOME RESOURCES TO GET. THINGS DONE AND SO- I WANT TO JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TO THE LAKE BASIN- WHICH A FAX SENATOR MCGUIRE AND MY DISTRICT AS WELL- I HOPE IS JUST APPROPRIATE TIME TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY YOU KNOW BUT ACTUALLY THE DAILY FAMILY CAME TO CALIFORNIA- BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A WORLD WAR ONE VETERAN AND ACTUALLY DO DREW A LAND GRANT INTO THE LAKE SO I HAVE THE DEED. TO THE PROPERTY WAS SIGNED BY FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT IN MY OFFICE- UNFORTUNATE WE SOLD THAT PIECE OF PROPERTY ABOUT TWELVE YEARS TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS AGO BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE WE STILL OWN THAT PROPERTY. AND THE DISTRICT UP THERE WAS ZEROED OUT OF WATER SO IT IS A- AREA WHERE WATER FROM THE FROM THE KLAMATH LAKE. IT GOES DOWN THE KLAMATH RIVER WHICH AFFECTS BOTH SENATOR MCGUIRE IN MY DISTRICT AND THERE'S ALSO WATER PROJECT IS ALSO. CONNECTED TO THAT IS THE UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE REFUGE. THATIS- HAS WITH THE PLACE FOR THE PACIFIC FLYWAY THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE SPECIES. THAT LIVE IN THAT. BASIN ARE THAT WE THAT WE NEED WATER- THE ALEC. TO THE TO THE CORRUGATION DISTRICT HAS BEEN ZEROED OUT THIS YEAR THAT MEANS THERE'S NO WATER. AT ALL- IN TWO THOUSAND ONE UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN GRAY DAVIS THEY ACTUALLY THE STATE ACTUALLY HELP THE DISTRICT ALSO MILES. AND THEY ARE THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO TURN THOSE WELLS ON AND BE ABLE TO HELP TAKE CARE OF THE HABITAT THIS IS ALSO SOME OF THE MOST FERTILE LAND IN THE WORLD. AND IT HAS A TENDENCY TO BELOW. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE GET NGUYEN MORE NET NOWADAYS THAN WE DID IN THE PAST AND SO- I'M GONNA BE ASKING FOR. A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR- AMENDMENT TO THIS BUDGET- AND- I GUESS THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD- TO GO TO THAT MASON SO THAT THEY CAN- JUST STABILIZE THE SOIL AND HELP THE MIGRANT WORKERS THAT ARE THAT ARE THERE AND THE- COMMUNITY- AND GET THAT WATER TURNED ON. AND GET THE AND SO TWENTY YEARS AGO THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT BUT WE NEED TO UPGRADE SOME OF THOSE- THIS THE STUFF IS THERE SO I WANTED TO JUST SHARE THE IT'S A- THIS IS AN AREA WHERE. THE PACIFIC FLYWAY- IF YOU DON'T PLANT THOSE FILLED IN HOLD THAT SOIL THERE'S NOHING THERE FOR THE BIRDS TO FORAGE ON AS A RESTING TO COME. TO THE REST OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE BAY DELTA AND EVEN FURTHER SOUTH. SO FOR THOSE REASONS MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT TO THIS TO ADD FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO AND THE MECHANICS OF IT- IN THE PAST THEY DID IT THROUGH- YES WHICH I AS A CHALLENGE I THINK FOR US NOW BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON WHERE THAT WERE NOT PART OF. RESOURCES GOES AND HOW IT GETS IMPLEMENTED. THAT'S THAT'S FINE AND FOR FOLKS THAT ARE LISTENING IN YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE'S- AS WE WERE INDICATORS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IMMEDIATELY FOR COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE FOR WATER IN DROUGHT. THIS AND THAT AND THAT'S YOU KNOW FIVE MILLION FOR COMMUNITIES SOME OF THE SMALLER DISTRICTS THAT WERE FOCUSING ON AND WE TAKE. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE THIRD WATER IF I USE EFFICIENCY FOR THE DROUGHT AND WE'RE GIVING YOU ONE FIFTY MILLION TAKE AG IN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO THE- TO. HELP RESIDENTIAL HOUSEHOLDS IN COMMERCIALS BUT YOUR POINT IS WELL. MADE FUNDED. THE NEED FOR. THESE MONEY TO GET OUT THE DOOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS IN APRIL RIGHT RIGHT AND I WANT TO JUST. COME IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE L. A. THE- THE AGENCIES. AND THE MEMBERS FOR THE I MEAN THE SOONER THE BETTER EVERY DAY WE WAIT. IS A DAY THAT WE'RE LOSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME SEEDS IN THE GROUND AND STABILIZE THAT SO WELL. AS WELL AS TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. OKAY LET'S SEE I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP- MY PAST OUR PANEL IS THERE ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING. OKAY OKAY SO. SENATOR STERN I'M SO SORRY I MEAN INTERRUPT I DON'T HAVE A DIGITAL HANDS NOT A HIKE THAT'S- IT'S GOING. SORRY ABOUT THAT CAN I JUST CAN I GET A SENSE ON THAT I ON THE SIGMA FRONT JUST TO. I KNOW WE'VE GOT- SOME FUNDING HERE BUT IT- HOW IS THAT PROCESS LOOKING RIGHT NOW I KNOW THE L. A. YO AND THAT. FROM THE FINANCE COMMENTED ON THAT. RECORD FOR YOU TO COME IN TO MEET THE WATER BOARD BUT- WHAT. WHAT WHAT THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS ARE IN SICK MAN PLANTATION AND WHAT WHAT SHOVEL READY LOOKS LIKE IN THAT WORLD HOW WE MAY SEE SOME OF THIS. FUNDING ABLE TO ACTUALLY ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PRESSURES IN THE PROCESS IS THE GSA'S GET THEIR PLANS TOGETHER CAN YOU. I DON'T KNOW BETWEEN THEM WE HAVE A MERE THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE POT FOR- THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FOR SEVERAL FOR SIGMA FOR TO SUPPORT DANTE D. W. ARE OKAY YEAH FOR DEEP. BUT ONE OF YOU GO AHEAD YEAH JUST TO GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO LOOK IN WHAT WHAT KIND OF- PRESSURE THAT MAY ALLEVIATE AND WHAT WHAT AND WHAT NEED LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE- THIS IS. RACHEL IN THERE SO THAT WAY I CAN TAKE A FIRST SHOT AND THEN- YOU KNOW MISS JONES I KNOW WORKS WITH YOU TO BE ART BUT NOT DIRECTLY IN SICKNESS I'M NOT SURE WHETHER SHE'S GOT ANY. INPUT BUT I KNOW THAT- AND AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASS AND SUBMITTED THEIR PLANS LAST YEAR DEPARTMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THEM BUT- AND DUE TO BE OUR- LAB RELEASED IT FOR THE FIRST FEW ROUNDS OF GRANTS. ARE USING PROPOSITON SIXTY EIGHT FUNDS FOR BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PLANS THOSE- GRANDMOTHER STATED BILLY PLANS FOR THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS. AND I KNOW THEY GOT MORE FUNDING REQUESTS AND THEY HAD FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THE FIRST ROUNDS. AND THAT'S JUST FOR THOSE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS NEXT JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS WHEN THE REST OF THE BASINS BY HIGH AND MEDIUM PRIORITY WILL SUBMIT THEIR- GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. AND THEN BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THOUGH SO THERE'LL BE INCREASED DEMANDS AND SO THE PROJECTS ARE THINGS LIKE- YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY THAT BUILDING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT- WATER SYSTEM SO THAT THEY CAN TRANSFER WATER MORE EASILY- BUILDING FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE- MORE FLOOD WATERS AND PERMEATED INTO THE GROUND TO HELP TRAIN REPLENISH GROUNDWATER BASINS. SO SOME LARGE CAPITAL PROJECTS LIKE THAT I WOULD ASSUME ALSO SOME KIND OF SMALLER PROJECTS OF INCREASED PLANNING INCREASED DATA COLLECTION SO THAT THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR PLANS AS THEY MOVE FORWARD. SO THOSE WOULD BE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS I WOULD EXPECT. AGAIN STARTING PROBABLY WITH THOSE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS THAT ARE FURTHER AHEAD. AND WITH THE REST OF THE B. SINCE COMING UP SOON BEHIND. YEAH WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE. LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS RIGHT NOW FOR OF BOND MEASURE THAT THERE ARE WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH TO HEAR THIS IS THIS IS REALLY THE HERE AND NOW THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW.
