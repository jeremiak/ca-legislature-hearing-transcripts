FOR BEING WILLING TO TAKE THIS OUT OF ORDER BRIEFLY THIS IS AB EIGHT OH EIGHT WHICH IS A CHILDREN'S CRISIS CONTINUUM. PILOT PROGRAM OPEN WORKING ON THE CONTINUE OF CARE REFORM SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. AND WHAT HAS ARISEN REALLY SENSE THAT IN THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND HAVE NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. INSURING THAT WE HAVE CAPACITY WITHIN THE STATE TO DEAL WITH KIDS WITH ALL LEVEL OF NEEDS. AND UNTIL LAST DECEMBER THERE WAS A SMALL COHORT BUT IMPORTANT COHORT THAT WE WERE SENDING OUT OF STATE. AND BECAUSE THE SS NEEDED TO DE CERTIFY ALL OF THOSE OUT OF STATE PROGRAMS THEY WERE BROUGHT BACK AND I WANT TO THANK DSS AND THE COUNTY'S. OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR WORKING TO MAKE SURE THOSE KIDS WERE. APPROPRIATELY PLACED. BUT THAT A FORTY STILL EXISTS AND POTENTIALLY THAT NEED. MIGHT ARISE AGAIN AND I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK. AT INSURING WE HAVE THAT CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA. TO DEAL WITH ALL THOSE KIDS. PRECLUDING THE NEED TO SEND THEM OUT OF STATE WHICH IS SOMETHING. FROM MY STANDPOINT I THINK WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING. ANY MORE. HELLO SO WHAT AB EIGHT AWAIT DOES IS IT CREATES. A MORE INTENSIVE SET OF POTENTIAL SERVICES. HEY CHRIS STABILIZATION UNIT. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY STEP DOWN THE SERVICES AS THE KIDS NEEDS ARE MET WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CHILDREN. AND THAT THEY ARE GETTING THEIR NEEDS MET WHATEVER THEY ARE. AND SOMETIMES WE CLASSIFY KIDS IS HIGH NEED. AND NOT NECESSARILY ABLE TO ADDRESS ACTUALLY THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN AND THAT'S THAT'S THE PIECE THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. SO THE TO. OUR YOUTH ARE GETTING IN THERE NEEDS MET. AND WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT CAN RSPOND. ADEQUATELY THROUGHOUT ALL COUNTIES AND ADEQUATELY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT'S WHAT AB EIGHT OH EIGHT IS ABOUT. AND WE ARE STILL. WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON IT AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT OUR APPROACH IS CORRECT.

AND MORE RECENTLY USING A SYSTEM OF EXPEDITED TRANSITION THAT HELPED TO BRING FAR MORE KIDS HOME RATHER THAN MOVING THEM INTO CONTINUE CONGREGATE SETTINGS THAT BEING SAID THERE'S A GAP IN CALIFORNIA THAT GAP IS REALLY- A SIGNIFICANT AND IT KEEPS YOUNG PEOPLE FROM STAYING HERE AND BEING SERVED IN THE MORE INDIVIDUALIZED SETTING SO THAT THEY CAN BENEFIT THEM THE MOST- THIS BILL SIXTY DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN DO THAT THAT WE CAN DO IT WELL THAT WE- ACROSS THE STATE.

AND IF WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE PROACTIVE AND WANT TO DO IT THEN WE KNOW WOULD HAVE QUICK IMPLEMENTATION MAKE ACTUALLY HAD THOSE COUNTIES BUT THERE WILL BE A WORK GROUP THAT WILL DETERMINE THE CRITERIA. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO. THE BY THE WAY THIS IS STRUCTURED IS COUNTIES ARE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DESIGN IT IS TO HAVE COUNTIES GET FIFTY PERCENT- MATCH FROM- THE STATE UP TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THE PROGRAM. SO COUNTIES WOULD PUT UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A STATE WOULD PUT UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FUND- THE MOST IT'S MOSTLY THE EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD BE WORKING. IN THE PHARMACY SOURCE PROGRAM. ACTOR AND THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM THIS ISN'T- YOU KNOW A PER PERMANENT ONGOING FUNDING- THIS IS USING ONE TIME FUNDING- POTENTIALLY THREE YEARS OF THAT SO THAT THEY CAN GET ESTABLISHED.

AND NOBODY IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OPERATOR AND THERE'S NO OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM AND THERE'S NO OPPOSITION IN THE VW OUR ROOM- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR MISTER GIBSON- I THINK THIS IS A- WELL THOUGHT OUT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION POLICY- I THINK THAT AGAIN- WE TALK ABOUT FIFTY FIVE. THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS PANDEMIC AND IT'S ONLY THE TIME WHEN THERE'S A PANDEMIC- THEY WANT TO PROVIDE SOME HELP TO THOSE TO BURY- INDIVIDUALS- I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IT'S MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING CARE OF- I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE- IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHO JUST DIDN'T HAVE MONEY. WHO THIS PANDEMIC- HAS TAKEN THEM OUT AND THEIR FAMILIES WISH THEY COULD- BURY THEM BUT THEY HAD TO DO RESERVE RIVER REVERT TO- BEING CREMATED- AND SO I THINK THAT IF IN FACT THE FAMILY WANTS TO LAY SOMEONE TO REST DURING A PANDEMIC WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE AND I THINK THIS IS CERTAINLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- HOPE THE AUTHOR WOULD. INCLUDE ME AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL. YES TENNIS DAVIS I THINK INTERESTED- I WILL BE SUPPORTING BILL I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ONE CAN APPLY FOR THE EXPENSE ASSISTANCE IS FAMILY FRIENDS. AND THE SECOND ONE IS- THIS IS FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES OR CAN ANYONE APPLY FOR THIS ASSISTANCE SORT OF SO THE PROGRAM WILL BE FOCUSED ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES WERE LOOKING AT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IS UTILIZING. THRESHOLDS LIKE- THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM THAT- REALLY TAKES A GOOD- ENCOMPASSING- I GUESS BURKE- SECTOR OF THE LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT TEARS WERE LOOKING AT. A DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES WILL WORK WITH US TO ESTABLISH THAT- SO THAT'S WHO IS ELIGIBLE IN TERMS OF WHO CAN ASK FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT. IT IS ANYONE WHO HAS THE ACTUAL. INVOICE RIGHT THE TICKET THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WE PAID FOR- AT THE FUNERAL COST- FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO LOST HER LIFE. IN THIS CASE TO CALL IT AND- THEY CAN BE REIMBURSED UP TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND OR THE DIFFERENCE THAT MAY BE REMAINING- THAT SHOULD BE PAID DIRECTLY TO A FUNERAL HOME HOW TO COVER THE EXPENSES- WE'RE HOPING TO UTILIZE. SIMILAR FRAMEWORKS THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SERVICES WHERE LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS HELP FACILITATE. THE PROCESS MAKING IT EASIER- OBTAIN. AND THEY'RE ORGANIZATIONS THAT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY- FEEL COMFORTABLE CONFIDENT- WORKING WITH- SO HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION IT DOESN'T I JUST I JUST WANT TO. MAKE A COMMENT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE OBVIOUSLY THAT THIS IS- THIS IS DEFINITELY GONNA BE BENEFICIAL. BUT SADLY THERE'S ALWAYS FRAUD AND WE LOOK AT EIGHTY D. AND HOW MUCH MONEY WE LOST THERE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY PUT IN SOME SAFETY- GUIDELINES HERE THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE REALLY CHECKING JUST MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS LEGIT. AND YOU KNOW AND IN THIS NOTHING GOING ON BETWEEN YOU KNOW ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER PARTY THAT'S THAT'S ALL I ASK. ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW GOT DOCUMENTS THAT WILL BE. REQUIRED IN ALL CERTIFICATES OF DEATH YOU KNOW FROM THE LOCAL COUNTY AGAIN IN A PAPERWORK FROM A. FUNERAL HOME OR THE EXPENSES WERE MADE. AND OTHER. LESS OF YOU KNOW KIND OF BACKSTOP THAT WE'RE WANTED TO MAKE SURE- PROVIDE THAT CERTAINTY THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE. ARE RECEIVING THE MONEY AND WE KNOW THAT- THE BILL. WILL ALSO ESTABLISHED A PROGRAM FOR FUTURE EMERGENCIES CALIFORNIA IS FACED WITH A HANDFUL OF OTHER. CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE NEED TO DECLARE EMERGENCIES WHETHER IT BE AN EARTHQUAKE. AND NOT JUST PROPERTY BUT LIFE IS LOST AS WELL AS SOME FIRES WHERE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS- UNFORTUNATELY ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED FAMILIES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THAT AS WELL SO. THE QUESTION THANK YOU. DR CHOI DID YOU HAVE QUESTIONS YEAH. I THINK THIS QUESTION SO TOUCHED UPON BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE- THE ELIGIBILITY IS- DID YOU SAVE HALF OF FOR THOSE OF THOSE WHO RECEIVING CALFRESH- OR ANYBODY CAN APPLY FOR THIS. THIS THIS ONE QUESTION FOR ALL CERTIFIED WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CALFRESH CRITERIA. AS THE ELIGIBILITY. TO ENCOMPASS THE LOW OR VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS CASE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY COPA NINETY YEAH IF THAT'S THE CASE AS I UNDERSTAND EACH KALLONI- IT HAS- WELL MOSTLY PROGRAMS A FOUR ENGINE PEOPLE FOR FINLAND EXPENSES. AND THE MOST OF THE EXPENSES WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF. THUS OF MY UNDERSTANDING IF THAT'S THE CASE IT ISN'T IS SO REDUNDANT UNNECESSARY. NO DOCTOR THERE IS NO KNOWN PROGRAM THAT ENCOMPASSES THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD PROVIDE A FUNERAL ASSISTANCE EXPENSES ARE REIMBURSEMENTS- THAT WE KNOW OF NOW THERE ARE PLACES THAT HAVE DECIDED TO USE THEIR FEDERAL FUNDING- THROUGH CARES ACT TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF ASSISTANCE OTHERS HAVE USED IT FOR OTHER- ESSENTIAL NEEDS OF THE POPULATION THAT THEY SERVE- I KNOW OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE USING THEIR DOLLARS- TO PROVIDE FUNERAL ASSISTANCE I KNOW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PROVIDED HERE WILL PAY. AS TO UTILIZE THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS SO YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO CERTAIN PLACES IN THE STATE WHERE THEY MAY BE DOING THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM BUT THERE IS NO STATEWIDE PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE PERMANENTLY ESTABLISHED IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THIS DECLARED EMERGENCY OUR FUTURE DECLARED EMERGENCIES AND THAT'S THE INTENT. OF THE BILL. AND I GET THE IMPRESSION THIS IS RETROACTIVE FOR ANYONE WHO- IT HAD TO. FAMILIES THAT FLED DUE TO A CORVETTE NINETEEN- SO OBVIOUSLY DISORDER- CALL VOTE TO PASS THE- CARISSA AND THE LAWS OF MOVING FOR. IS THE TRUTH MARCH FOURTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY IS WHEN THE GOVERNOR DECLARED THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND SO THAT'S THE BEGINNING UP UNTIL THE POINT WHERE HE SAYS WE ARE NO LONGER IN THIS EMERGENCY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PASSED THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY AND IF ELIGIBLE RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE COST. CHAU WILL ORDER WITH HIS CONTINUING WEST ALONG AS AS SOMEBODY DEFINING SAID THAT THAT WAS A CONNECTED TO CALL THE NINETEEN THEN THE OLD PALATABLE NOT BASED UPON THEIR INCOME SO D. THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE BASED ON INCOME RIGHT AND WE'RE SAYING LOW INCOME AND I'LL AGAIN REITERATE THE CALFRESH CRITERIA IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HIGHS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CAUGHT TIED TO COFFEE NINETEEN DEATHS SO SPECIFICALLY THIS EMERGENCY IS COVER NINETEEN- POST CODE NINETEEN IT MAY BE AN EARTHQUAKE. THAT CAUSES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LOSS OF LIFE IN YOUR AREA OF MY AREA THAT IS PRONE TO EARTHQUAKES- AND THEN THE GOVERNOR WOULD DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY HE WOULD THEN NEED TO FUND THE PROGRAM AND THEN PEOPLE WILL BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR. THIS PROGRAM BUT WHEN THIS EMERGENCY ENDS THE PROGRAM ENDS AND IF SO ANYTHING GOVERNOR DECLARES SO DECLARATION OF. EMERGENCY WATER ENTITLED. YEAH SIR SO THE MINUTE THAT THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE EMERGENCY. AND WE GAVE EXAMPLES EARTHQUAKES- FIRES ANOTHER PANDEMIC GOD FOR BID WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE THAT AGAIN BUT- THEN THE PROGRAM WILL NEED TO BE FUNDED. AND THEN PEOPLE CAN BEGIN TO APPLY. HAVE YOU HAD ANY IDEA OF- FROM THE PAST- RECORD TELEPHONE SUCH. EMERGENCY RELATED TASKS IN THE FUTURE WHAT THE COSTS WILL ALL FALL INTO SPEEDY TO COST WOULD BE. NO SIR WE HAVEN'T. THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE TO SOME OF HER LOOK I ATE GOOD QUESTIONS FROM FROM ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO EXPAND A BIT ON WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS AND DOES AND I THINK IT DEMONSTRATES A HIGH LEVEL OF COMPASSION BY LEADERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMPACT THAT COVER NINETEEN IS HAD ON ON POOR PEOPLE AND- IT SADDENS ME TO SEE THAT FAMILIES. HAVE TO STILL YOU KNOW SUFFERED NOT ONLY THE JOB LOSS AND ALL OF THE OTHER BURDENS THAT ARE COME FROM IT AND NOW IT'S A DEATH WHERE THEY CAN'T RESPECTFULLY LAY THEIR LOVED ONE TO REST- YOU KNOW YOU SEE CANS AT THE GOT THE STORY C. CAR WASHES HAPPENING HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO. THE RIGHT THING AND BE ABLE TO HELP OUR LOW VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES BURY THEIR LOVED ONES THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR APPLE. THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER. TO HAVE A MOTION. WHICH THE SECOND. YEAH THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE CALDERON AYE CALDERON AYE DAVIES DAVIES I ARAMBULA ARAMBULA I'D CHOI THE FOURTEENTH CHINA VOTING GIPSON. GIPSON ICE DOWN STONE ARAMBULA WHO DON'T. LORD LORD I. SIX THE VOTER SIXTIES ERA THANK YOU. OKAY AND SOME WOMEN GRAYSON ARE YOU READY 2% ON AB. FOUR SEVEN NINE. OKAY. MISTER GRIFFIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I DO WANT TO- ACKNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE THE SPECIAL WORK- THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF HAVE BEEN SO KIND OF- AND INVITE SOME GUIDANCE TO THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED AND IF THIS BILL WAS TO MOVE FORWARD I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU AB FOUR SEVENTY NINE WHICH AUTHORS A PERSON TO APPLY TO BE A FAMILY CHILD CARE SECONDARY LICENSEE FOR A PRIMARY LICENSEE AND REQUIRES THAT A SECONDARY LICENSEE TO MEET ALL LICENSE ARE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLES TO A LICENSEE EXCEPT THE REQUIREMENT TO RESIDE IN THE HOME IN WHICH THE FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME IS OPERATED. FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES ARE A CRITICAL AND VITAL SERVICE FOR FAMILIES AND LIKE CHILD CARE CENTERS THAT OPERATE IN COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES ARE OPERATED IN INDIVIDUALS RESIDENTIAL HOME MAKING THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF LOCATION MOST WORKING PARENTS SELECTOR CHILD CARE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF LOCATION AND COST FOR INSTANCE SINGLE WORKING MOTHERS WHO DO NOT HAVE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION GOING TO WORK AND ALSO FINDING WAYS TO TRANSPORT THEIR CHILD TO A CHILD CARE FACILITY AND BACK CAN PROVE TO BE A HUGE CHALLENGE AND BARRIER TO ACCESS. HOWEVER IF THERE IS A FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME AVAILABLE AND OPEN DIRECTLY WITHIN HER NEIGHBORHOOD SHE IS ABLE TO ACCESS QUALITY CARE AND STILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WHILE THE STATE HAS INCREASED INVESTMENTS INTO THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM CALIFORNIA'S LICENSED FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME HAS BEEN A STEADY DECLINE HAS BEEN A STEADY DECLINE SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE AND THIS DECLINE HAS ONLY BEEN EXASPERATED EXASPERATED BY THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING BECAUSE FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES ARE MORE LIKELY TO OFFER FLEXIBLE HOURS OF CARE AND ARE MORE AFFORDABLE THAN CENTER BASED CARE ASSISTING WORKING FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY FINANCIAL LOSSES AND HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS HAVE FORCED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES TO CLOSE PERMANENTLY. FURTHER INCREASING THE GAP IN THE NEED FOR CHILD CARE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF CHILD CARE SLOTS AB FOUR SEVENTY NINE SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE DECLINING FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME SUPPLY. AND THE RAPIDLY INCREASING GAP OF AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE SLOTS. BY CREATING A SECONDARY LICENSEE THIS WILL ALLOW QUALIFIED CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO BE PAIRED WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY OPERATING SPACE. THIS WILL CREATE GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE CHOOSING TO- WORK AS A CHILD CARE PROVIDER WHO MEET LICENSE ARE REQUIREMENTS BUT DO NOT HAVE THE RESIDENTIAL SPACE. TO OPERATE A CHILD CARE HOME ULTIMATELY AB FOUR SEVENTY NINE WILL IMPROVE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE QUALITY OR QUALITY CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION BY FILLING THE GAP IN CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WITHIN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. BY INCREASING THE FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME SUPPLY WITHIN UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS AND AIMS TO CHILD CARE SYSTEM. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY STAFF AND I HAVE SPOKEN WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND VARIOUS CHILD CARE PROVIDER STAKEHOLDERS AND ARE AWARE THERE ARE CONCERNS. WITH THE BILL AND CURRENT LANGUAGE I HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. TO ENSURE THAT WE INCLUDE AMENDMENTS THAT ALL IMPACTED PARTIES CAN AGREE UPON WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESS. JIM MILLER. OFTEN LEAVE EXECUTIVE. DIRECTOR OF WATCH ME GROW EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON OPERATOR. YOU OPEN THE LINE. PLEASE GO AHEAD- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND THANK YOU GRAYSON BOTHERS YOU'RE DOING- UNTIL THAT AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS- MY NAME IS JIMMY LONNIE AND I AM THE OWNER OF WATCHING PROGRAMS CHILD CARE OF THE LAYOUT HAVE BEEN OPERATING FOR NINE YEARS AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING SOLANO COUNTY PROVIDERS AS WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FOUR SEVEN NOT- EIGHTY FOUR SEVEN NINE OF THE BILL WILL CHANGE THE WORLD OF CHILDCARE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE BEST. OF NOT JUST THE PROVIDERS WILL ALSO PUT CHILDREN THE FAMILIES AND OUR ECONOMY ACT AT THE CHILD CARE IS VITAL TO OUR CATS TO OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY SUBFAMILIES CHAPTER HELD THE OFTEN FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE WE WERE ATTENTION WORKERS TREE CALLED THE WHICH ARE CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF THE OTHER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD AND PROVIDE TOP. HERE WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT- THERE HAD BEEN CLOSED WITH THE FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME DUE TO THE FACT IT MAKES A HIGH PERCENTAGE WERE MOSTLY SENIOR PROVIDERS WILL CLOSE DUE TO THEIR HIGHER RISK OF TRANSMISSION OF CALL THE NINETEEN ARE YOU ALSO HAVE THOSE PROVIDERS WHO ARE JUST AFRAID OF COLD IN NINETEEN AND DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN CONTACT WITH ANYONE ALL OF THAT PROVIDER FOR A MONTH UNTIL I STARTED THINKING ABOUT. HOW MUCH CLOSER WAS AFFECTING THE CHILDREN WHO WERE NO LONGER IN MY CHAIR THEY WEREN'T YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR NEEDS WHAT THEY NEEDED AND I START THINKING ABOUT THE FAMILY ALSO WHO ARE HAVING A HARD TIME LOOKING FOR CHILD CARE BECAUSE MOST CHILD. HERE CAN'T CLOSE. SO WHAT COULD HAPPEN DIDN'T CLOSE ABOUT CHILD HOME. YOU HAVE BEEN HAVING A THEY CAN'T LIE TO- THE PROVIDER TO. WITH HAD AND I TO HIGH SOMEONE OPERATE AT THE PROVIDER IN THE BUSINESS CONNECTED. OUR INTO. CARE FOR TO. WHICH ALSO ALLOWS THE PARENTS CONTINUE IN THE WORK. AND NOT HAVE TO MOVE JOB IS TO LACK OF CHILD CARE WE IS JUST ANOTHER AND IS. THAT I'M NOT A BAD IMAGE. IT'S AT THAT CLOSE THE FAMILY HOME. CARE SPACES. BY 23% MY NAME. THAT LOOK LIKE A- OF. A THAT. CHILL THAT WERE WITHOUT. HERE AND I KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE WAY THAT. IT IS THE AT THE- THAT. TWO POINT THREE MILLION. IN UNDERSERVED. DISADVANTAGED HALL BY NEED A CHILD HERE AND DO NOT RECEIVE SERVICES. AND THAT 86% OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE CHILDREN OF COLOR. SB FOUR SEVEN NINE- WORKED ON THE CHAPTER HEALTHCARE UPGRADE PROVIDE CARE FOR THAT CHECK. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES NOT ABLE TO ACCESS CHILD CARE DUE TO LACK OF TRANSPORTATION. AB FOUR SEVEN NOW WE CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR MANY FAMILIES TO HAVE A FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THEIR HOME. AB FOUR SEVEN. FOUR SEVEN I WILL CREATE MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THOSE SEEKING A CAREER IN THE BILL UP. EARLY CARE AND LEARNING. THIS WILL ALSO BE A WAY TO GET PARENTS INVOLVED CREATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM. MANY OF PROVIDERS. WOULD YOU- THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GROW POTENTIAL CHILD CARE BUSINESS ALL OF OUR SPORTS STAFF. AND BATTLE SHOWS UP AT 10% OF CHILD HERE IN THE U. S. R. CONSIDER QUALITY ONLY TEN PERCENT. I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE PROVIDERS THAT ARE JUST IN IT FOR THE MONEY AND THEY HAVE A DEAL REQUIRED TO TAKE EARLY CARE AND LEARNING. COURT FELT SB FOUR SEVEN NINE THE PROVIDER CAN HIRE SOMEONE. WHO HAS A PASSION TO CARE FOR THE CHILDREN. AND HAVE THEM SERVE AS THE LEAD TEACHER. BEEN OLDER CAMPERS DO WHATEVER THEY REALLY HAVE A PASSION FOR AND IT'S NOT YOU KNOW WHATEVER YOU'RE ABOUT THE MONEY. THIS BILL CAN. ALSO ENCOURAGE MORE PROVIDERS INTO TO CONTINUE THE AND AGREE EARLY. EDUCATION WITH WILL INCREASE THE- OF CARE THAT. TO THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SO SB FOUR SEVEN NINE THE NEED. IN IS THE NEEDS ARE IMPROVE ACCESS AND UPDATE. THE CHILD CARE AND THE- WHICH- BECAUSE- AT THE BACK RIGHT. BY PENDANT. CHILDCARE CLUB. WHO HAVE A LOT WITH THE- WILL NOW HOW AFTER TO RE- OPEN WITH THE- ONE. THE NEEDS ALL THE REQUIRED.

WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT ALL FAMILY TALK YOUR LICENSEES CONTINUE TO BE PERSONS. WHO RESIDE IN THE HOME AND ARE THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER. WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRANSFER OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOR THE FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME- WOULD TAKE THE FAMILY AND THE HOME OUT OF FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME. AND WITH IT THE HEART AND SOULOUT OF FAMILY CHILD CARE THROUGHOUT THE AGES WE'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS AND THEY BE KNOWN THAT OUR FAMILIES THAT GIVE US CARE SECURITY INTERPRET THAT YOU CATION.

THANK YOU PART ONE PRINTER TO HAVE ANYONE ELSE ALIVE ONE SEVENTY SEVEN. YES ONE SEVENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME'S KAREN KOEHLER AND I'M FROM CREATIVE JOURNEYS- FAMILY HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOTHING TO PROTECT. THE CURRENT PUBLIC CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IT OPENS THAT UP TO A LOT OF LIABILITY. AND IT DOESN'T STOP ANYBODY FROM HOLDING MORE THAN- ONE NIGHT. OR ONE SECONDARY LICENSE IT DOESN'T PROTECT THE CHILDREN IN OUR CARE IT DOESN'T PROTECT THE FAMILIES IN OUR CARE AND I AFTER DUE TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. OPERATOR TO EVERYONE ELSE ON THE LINE IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THE TIME THREE THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM- DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. SOMEONE IN CHOI. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON I THINK I REALLY UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE APPEAL TO MAKE A MORE CHILD CARE FACILITIES AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF ALWAYS- FROM MY EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF POOR CHILD CARE CENTERS. EVEN THOUGH INTENT IS GOOD BUT THE- I READ THAT THE ANALYSIS A VERY CAREFULLY AND- I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS- SINCE AT THIS BILL IS TO ALLOW FAMILY TAKE CARE. OF FACILITY WITHOUT HAVING TO LEAVE IN THAT HOME. SO THAT IS SO IF I WAS CO HOMEOWNER- OPERATING AND THAT MEANS I CAN- RAN TEN AS THE HOUSE. TICKETS ARE ON OUR OWN LEVY IN THAT pTHIRD ONE FOURTH ONE. IS THAT THE ALLOWABLE RESELLERS YOU ARE REFERRING AS A SECONDARY I SINCE NO SIR. SO THE WAY IT WOULD WORK IS- AND THIS WOULD ALSO ANSWER ONE OF THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS IS THERE IS NO TRANSFER OF LICENSE. THE PRIMARY LICENSEE HAS TO BE THE HOMEOWNER THAT LIVES IN THE HOME SO WHAT WE DON'T WANT AND THIS IS WHERE WE EED TO. TIGHTEN UP LANGUAGE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH LEAD COUNSEL IN WITH- WITH OPPOSITION WHO STATED THEY WERE WORKING WITH US AS WELL AS THIS COMMITTEE- BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT AS CORPORATIONS COMING IN IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND JUST OPENING UP A BUNCH OF DAYCARES UNDER A CORPORATE NAME SO YOU HAVE TO BE A PRIME A PRIMARY LICENSEE HAS TO BE THE RESIDENT OF THE HOME. OR OWNER OF THE HOME AND A RESIDENT OF THE HOME THE DIFFERENCE IS RIGHT NOW IT REQUIRES IF- IF YOU'RE A PRIME IF YOU'RE THE LICENSEE IT REQUIRES YOU TO BE THERE 80% OF THE TIME AND ACCORDING TO RULES- THAT BAKER CAN ONLY BE CLOSED LEGITIMATELY FOR TWO WEEKS OUT OF THE YEAR. SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT DOES ALLOW A HOMEOWNER WHO POSSIBLY HAS A JOB. BUT THEY HAVE OPEN SPACE. THE HOME AND THEY POSSIBLY KNOW SOMEONE THAT'S IN THE CHILD CARE FIELD WANTS TO ENTER THE CHILD CARE FOR OF. THAT LIVE SOMEWHERE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SPACE. THAT HOMEOWNER WOULD BE THE PRIMARY LICENSEE THEY COULD BRING AND THAT PERSON THAT USES THEIR HOME DURING THE DAY IS A DAY CARE. BUT THEIR LICENSEES A SECONDARY LICENSE HE IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIMARY LICENSEE ALL LIABILITY. ALL ALL INSPECTIONS. ALL REGULATORY POLICY EVERYTHING FALLS ON THE PRIMARY LICENSEE WHO LIVES AT THE HOME AND WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY. AND THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE OF WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE A BIT OF BETWEEN. I COULDN'T USED THE TERM AS A MY EMPLOYEE HIRED THAT PERSON. RATHER THAN SECONDARY PERSON HAVING TO SECURE THE LICENSE AGAIN RIGHT BUT IT DOES NOT ADDRESS ALL SPEAK TO A MANAGER YES. MANAGER IS A REQUIRED THAT TO LOOK AT THE END OF THE- LICENSE. BUT TWO THINGS SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IF I CALLED THE PERSON S. ON MY EMPLOYEE. OR LICENSE HOLDER. THERE THERE IS NO PROVISION RIGHT NOW YOU CAN HAVE AN ASSISTANT BUT THAT DOES NOT NEGATE THE FACT THAT THE PRIMARY OR THE LICENSEE HAS TO STILL BE THERE 80% OF THE TIME EVEN WITH AN ASSISTANT. SO UNDER CURRENT- POLICY THERE IS NO PROVISION TO HAVE SOMEONE COME IN AND RIP AND REPLACE OR BE THERE IN THE STEAD OF MAX NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO UNDER THIS BILL. A DAY CARE WE HAVE SOME WONDERFUL DAY CARE PROVIDERS OUT THERE WHO ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED BUT THEY'VE DONE SO VOLUNTARILY THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR A MAJORITY OF THE HOME DAY CARES THAT ARE OUT THERE. THE MAJORITY THE HOME DAY CARES OUT THERE YOU TAKE AN EMERGENCY CLASS CPR AND UNDER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THAT'S IT UNDER THIS BILL IT WOULD REQUIRE THE SECONDARY LICENSE HE ACTUALLY HAS TO HAVE A MINIMUM. OF A EARLY CHILDHOOD CREDIT- CREDITS THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GO WORK IN A CENTER AND SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE TWELVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CREDITS JUST TO BE ABLE TO START. SO WITH THAT- IT RAISES THE QUALITY OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THAT'S THERE IT ALSO ALLOWS THERE TO BE THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HOMEOWNER DOESN'T AS THE LICENSE HE- DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THERE THE FULL 80% OF THE TIME. IT WOULD ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO BE ABLE TO COME IN AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE THAT- THAT- DAY CARE SO YOU'LL BE AND IS. JUST OF CREATING. 20% OF ALL FLEXIBILITY FOR THE PRIMARY LICENSE HOLDER. BY BRINGING IN THE SECONDARY LICENSE HOLDER. AND THEN HE CAN FILL UP- MY ABSENCE. NOT OVER 20% NOTE 20%% IS CURRENT RIGHT NOW. WHERE THE PROPOSAL I SINCE E DOES CAN BE GONE 20% OF THE TIME. WHAT THE SECONDARY LICENSEE WHICH DOES NOT EXIST AT THIS POINT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT WOULD ALLOW. FOR THAT PERSON TO NOT HAVE TO BE THERE 80% OF THE TIME. WELL YEAH LET TO ONLY BEING 20% IT WOULD ALLOW THAT SECOND A PERSON TO BE THERE FULL TIME AND RUN THE DAY CARE. SO SELFISH BUT IT WILL NOT- HAVE ANY MINIMUM AMOUNT OF THE TIME THAT THE PRIMARY A LICENSE HOLDER CASH SHOULD BE AT THE START THAT IS CORRECT AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE WOULD REQUIRE THE PERSONAL TRAINING IN THE WEST AT THIS BILL ALLOWS US TO HIRE YOUNG. MY MANAGER. A MANAGER WITH A LICENSE. WITH ORIGINALLY CHILDHOOD NATION YES WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CREDITS SHE SO BUT THAT WOULD NT ALLOW ME TO OPEN THE SECONDARY HOW ABSOLUTELY THAT WHAT IF I IF I OR IF I HAVE A AND OF THE PROPERTY HOLLY THE PLAN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LIVE IT BOTH RESIDENTS I GUESS- I. BECAUSE WE THE RULE WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD NOT ONLY BE THE PROPERTY OWNER BUT YOU WOULD BE THE RESIDENTS. PRESENT THERE. YOU HAVE TO SHOW PROOF THAT YOU ACTUALLY LIVE THERE AS A RESIDENT HOW HOW DO YOU DEFINE REST AND SEE HOW OF 70% 80% OF THE SELECTING A WE WOULD LOOK INTO. WAS WE WOULD FIND SOME LANGUAGE THAT ALREADY EXIST ON WHAT DETERMINES RESIDENCY AND WE WOULD INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE BILL. I SEE OKAY HI THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU DR TRUTH. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NOW OKAY- I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT AND SOMEONE GRAYSON- YOU AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AND- I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF.

YES ALL RIGHT I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB NINETY TWO WHICH WILL CREATE AN EQUITABLE SLIDING SCALE FOR FAMILY FEES THAT WILL ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON WORKING FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR CHILD CARE. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE STATES FOR PARENTS WHO NEED CHILD CARE SERVICES. WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATE OR FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS THAT HELP FAMILIES PAY FOR CHILD CARE FAMILIES WHO NEED TO CARE MUST STILL PAY WHAT IS CALLED FAMILY FEES. THESE FEES GROWERS INCOME ARISES AND CAN BE UP TO SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH. WHICH IS UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY WORKING FAMILIES. THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ONLY HEIGHTENED THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE. ESPECIALLY FOR WORKING MOTHERS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO ARE SIGNIFICANT PART OF CHIP CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL WERE FOR WORKFORCE. IN LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ECONOMIC RECESSION PARENTS NEED AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE NOW MORE THAN EVER IN ORDER TO CONTINUE PROVIDING FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AB NINETY TWO WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY CONVENING A WORK GROUP OF PARENTS. PROVIDERS CHILD CARE STAKEHOLDERS. AND OTHERS TO DEVELOP AN EQUITABLE SLIDING SCALE FOR FAMILY FEES THAT BETTER REFLECTS THE FAMILY'S BUDGET. THIS BILL WILL PROTECT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BY ENSURING THEY DO NOT ABSORB THE COST OF A REDUCTION IN FAMILY FEES. AND THAT THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE SPACES IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT REDUCED. AND FINALLY AB NINETY TWO WILL UTILIZE FEDERAL FUNDING TO TEMPORARILY WAIVE FAMILY FEES FOR ALL FAMILIES UNTIL OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

THAT IN A NEIGHBORING DISTRICT THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL LAST IN ANOTHER DISTRICT MEMBERS DISTRICT THERE'S A RALPH'S MARKET THAT OF BOTH THE KROGER WHO OWNS FOOD PLEASANT ROUGH MARKETS DECIDE TO CLOSE THESE STORES.

THERE IT WOULD GIVE WRITTEN NOTICE BETWEEN SIXTY AND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS FOR THE EMPLOYEES SO THAT THEY CAN ONE RECEIVE- INFORMATION THAT THE STORES CLOSING TO MAKE SURE THAT RESOURCES ARE MADE AVAILABLE.

TWO STORES RECENTLY WERE- COOK NOW TO BE CLOSED BY KROGER'S IN THE LONG BEACH AREA- THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES SIXTEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS NOTICE FOR THE WORKERS I THINK THAT SHOULD MORE THAN FAIR I DO ALSO WANT TO PUT SOME SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT OVER THESE THE STORE CLOSURES AND THE AUDACITY QUITE FRONT OF THE STORE CLOSURES- DURING THE CALL BUT CRISIS. THERE HAVE BEEN RECORD SALES AT GROCERY STORES AROUND THE COUNTRY COKER'S AN ALBERTSON'S OF SEEN SAUCE SALES IN THE LAST YEAR- 10225% OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR- SECOND NOT ONLY OF SILICON UP BUT PROFITS HAVE GONE UP LET'S USE KROGER'S AGAIN AS AN EXAMPLE THERE ARE TWENTY NINETEEN PROFITS WERE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY DURING COVERT THERE WERE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION SO NOT ONLY ARE THERE GETTING RECORD SALES. NOT ONLY ARE THEY GETTING RECORD PROFITS THEY ARE THEY PASSED TO THEM POLICE TO COME TO WORK TO RESTORE LIVES- TO PUT THEMSELVES IT LITERALLY ON THE FRONTLINE- IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO EAT AND IT'S AND IT'S SO UNFAIR NO IN RESPONSE TO ALL OF THAT SACRIFICE FOR THE GROCERY STORES NOW TO SAY.

THANK YOU OPERATOR WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION IN THE HEARING ROOM DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR FROM THE COMMITTEE AND THIS TO WORK THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON FOR I'M INTRODUCING THIS LEGISLATION I UNDERSTAND AND- AND FULLY SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT THE NEED FOR THE BILL I'M LEARNING IF YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY YOU CHOSE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS AND- IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE YOU ARE WORKING ON IT JUST FEELS. LONG VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT MARKET CONDITIONS MIGHT LOOK LIKE FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW TO MAKE THAT DECISION OF WHAT HAPPENED SIX MONTHS FROM NOW AND IF THERE'S ALREADY EXISTING LAW THAT-YOU KNOW MANDATE CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OR SEVENTY FIVE DAYS- ARE ARE YOU WORKING ON ON A TIME PERIOD THAT MIGHT- IMPLEMENT WELL. I AM CERTAINLY WILL IS- WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL FIRST- SECONDLY HOW CARE IF THE STORES GETTING READY TO CLOSE RIGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A THERE SHOULD BE NO OBLIGATION. ESPECIALLY TO FRONTLINE WORKERS TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH AS NOTICED AS POSSIBLE I DON'T THINK SIX MONTHS NOTICE IF THEY KNOW- BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT NOTICE THIS IS NOT ABOUT DAYS IS ABOUT WHAT A CD JOHNSON TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE TO MAKE SURE THOSE FRONT LINE WORKERS. WHO'VE BEEN WORKING DAY IN DAY OUTJUST LIKE ARE HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND IS THE OVER DISPUTE OVER THE HERO MONEY THAT CITIES PASS TO SUPPORT GROWTH STORE WORKERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT NOT THE GOD IT'S REALLY ABOUT THAT IS ABOUT WHAT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND THE CITY. OF LONG BEACH DID THAT BROUGHT US INTO THIS THAT I HAVE I DON'T BEGRUDGE THEM I THINK WE SHOULD BE PAYING THESE GROCERY STORE WORKERS BUT TO UP IN CLOSE INCOME IN A COMMUNITY THAT'S ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET I THINK IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR THEM TO GIVE THEM A SIX MONTH DEPLOYMENT SIXTY DAYS. TO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WITHOUT A NOTICE. RIGHT AND I AGREE WITH YOU ESPECIALLY I THINK THAT THE OPERATIVE PHRASE THEY IS IF. KNOW AND THE NOT YOU KNOW TO THE THAT THE CAN IS ARE SO TINY. TO SOME IS GONNA CHANGE REVENUE LIKE CERTAINLY POINT THEY HAVEN'T- PEOPLE ARE USING THE GROCERY STORE BUT IF. YOU KNOW SOMETHING REALLY CHANGES A CIRCUMSTANCES- WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAT. YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY MAY FEEL THE NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT AS A BUSINESS SITE. I UNDERSTAND THAT PERSPECTIVE TO AND YOU KNOW LOOKING AT PREVIOUS LEGISLATION- FOR EXAMPLE CONSOLES THIS BILL FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT. YOU KNOW I HAD A NINETY DAY TRANSITION PERIOD TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYEES COULD TRANSFER FROM ONE- ONE ONE PLAY TO A SUCCESSOR EMPLOYER- AND SO JUST I THINK I LOVE THE- GIVEN A COURTESY I TODAY- BUT JUST KIND OF CONTINUE TO. TIE ALL THESE TOGETHER INTO TIME FRAMES THAT MAKES SENSE FOR BOTH PARTIES- I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMMENT AND I. I CONCUR AGAIN I WILL WE WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION- TO. FIND A MIDDLE GROUND- BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN GIVE THOSE EMPLOYEES- ANOTHER HEADS UP NOTICE. AND I THINK AGAIN WE CAN'T STOP THIS DOOR FROM CLOSING OR NONE OF THE STORES FROM CLOSING. BUT WE SHOULD HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY OBLIGATION TO THOSE EMPLOYEES TO MAKING SURE. THAT ONE TAKE PREPARE THEMSELVES SOMETIME IT TAKES A LOOK AT MORE. THAN US SIX WEEKS OR OR SIXTY DAYS IN ORDER TO PREPARE YOURSELF ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LOSING YOUR JOB. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TOOL WE KNOW WHEN WE KNOW OUR EXPIRATION DATE HERE'S MEMBERS OF LEGISLATURE. SO WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF OUR TERM. THESE EMPLOYEES DOESN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT AND ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT DURING THIS TIME- EXPENSE YOU DOING A PANDEMIC- THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN. WE SHOULD GIVE THEM AS MUCH TIME AS MUCH NOTICE. AS MUCH RESOURCES AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. THANK YOU MAY DAVIS. THANK MISTER GIPSON. A COUPLE QUESTIONS AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND- SOMETHING LIKE A GROCERY STORE WHICH COULD BE A PRIVATE- BUSINESS. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AT WILL WORKERS THERE AS WELL. AND SO DID GIVING SOMEONE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS- YOU COULD HAVE EVER DECIDE TO LEAVE. AND ALSO YOU HAVE NOBODY THERE TO BE EMPLOYED. I THINK FOR ME BY QUESTION IS IF YOU WITH THIS ONE FORWARD- WHAT TYPE FIND WHAT IT BE AND IF THIS PLACE IS GOING UNDER. YOU KNOW HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO PAY IT- YOU SAID ABOUT BY TO FIND. YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE A BANDAID THAT THEY HAVE TO GET DISCONNECTED WHAT WOULD BE THE REPLICATIONS OF IF THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN WE'RE STILL WORKING ON ON THE BILL IN THE LANGUAGE- AND SO THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE WERE CERTAINLY GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WORK OUT SOMETHING IS REASONABLE AGAIN WE'RE TALKING FOR ME M. M. FROM MY LAND IS MAKING SURE THAT EMPLOYEES- THIS WOULD NOT BE. A MOM AND POP BUSINESS BECAUSE THE TALK ABOUT SQUARE FOOT AS WE TALK ABOUT- WE DO LOOK AT TRADER JOE'S TEN THOUSAND SQUARE IF WE LOOK AT- SUPER WALLMARK A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUGE DIP- GROCERY STORE SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A MOM AND POP GROCERY STORE WE TALK ABOUT A CHAIN- SPECIALLY IN THIS CASE IS THE NATIONAL CHAIN KROGER THAT OWNS FOOD LASSEN ALSO WRAPS MARKETS. IT AND I UNDERSTAND BELIEVE A GIRL SHE'S THE DEFINITION GROCERY STORES LIKE FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET- AND- SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR REALLY IS WHAT WHAT IS THE PENALTY YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IT REALISTIC IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SO HIGH THEY'RE GOING UNDER IT AND THEY DON'T YOU KNOW IT WAS GOOD PAID THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR SURE AND I WOULD JUST IN RESPONSE TO THAT- ONE THAT- BECAUSE ALBERTA TO RICO TALKED ABOUT- THE AMOUNT OF PROFIT THAT. THEY MADE LAST YEAR OVER THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- AND YOU KNOW SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A GREAT A COMPANY WHO WILL GO UNDER- IT WEATHERS WE RESPECT TO THIS WE TALK ABOUT COMPANY HAS MADE MONEY HAND OVER FIST AGAIN I THINK ABOUT THE EMPLOYEES WHEN. CRAFTING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. YOU. THANK YOU AND NOW SOME REMEMBER GIPSON- I- APOLOGIZE I IF FOR THIS QUESTION HAS ARISEN ALREADY- BUT- I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT SO WHY. YOU ARE- GROCERY STORES ON THE- WHERE IS- ANY- THOUGH- BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING- WILL HAVE A EMPLOYEES AT AND THEN NOT WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER ONE EMPLOYEES SO WITHOUT. LACK A FEDERAL WARRANT ACT HAS SOME MORE THAN A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES TO AND I'M NOT- CAL CALIFORNIA WARN ACT TO- SPECIFIES- SEVENTY FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES FOR TERM IMPROPER USE OF TO NOTIFY- THE- LOCAL GOVERNMENT THOUGH AND- IS ALREADY EXISTING LAW AND OF BEING PRACTICED SO I RECEIVED THOSE SUCH A NOTICES SO WHEN I WAS SO- WITH THE- A LOCAL GOVERNMENT- BUT THE. Y. HI IS IT THE- DIFFERENT FROM THAT THE WAR- TAX THAT SAW EXISTS- I HADN'T. THE. THE NOTICE OF PURE UNIT OF TWO HOURS OF FEDERAL HIS SISTER DAY OF GROW OR IS AND THE ROLE CAN WARRANT SUBS SIXTY OF NO A BUT THE- WHETHER YOU ARE CHANGE- THE- THE PERIOD THE WHOLE MANY DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE COURTS ARE STORED SO WOULD HAVE TO- NOTIFY THIS IS A. ONE EXAMPLE ONE. REGULATE AFTER ANOTHER- YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE- I THINK THAT'S A SUITABLE BEACH A RECENTLY CLOSED- TO- GROCERY CHAINS OWNED BY KROGER ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE OF- HERE WILL PAY REQUIREMENTS- THAT WAS SO AND OF THE BURDEN. YOU KNOW EVEN SO INTENT THE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GOOD BUT- THAT KIND OF A REQUIREMENT IS SO LITERALLY KILLING THE BUSINESSES. AND YOU CAN THINK ABOUT. WHAT KIND OF LOST A JOB LOSS AND THE REVENUE LOSS FOR THE CITY OF LONG BEACH ETCETERA THIS IS A AND I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW HOW AWFUL TO ME. ON NECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY PRE EXISTING AND KNOW WHAT THIS- LAW WOULD REQUIRE WHAT WHAT WHAT BENEFITS TO WILL BRING. US TO THE EMPLOYEES. OR TO THE COMMUNITY. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN CALL ON THE SURE AND WE DID COVER SOME OF THAT THAT YOU JUST SPOKE OF ONE. IT PROVIDES A COMMUNITY NOTICE- ON THE DOOR OF THE STORE THIS BEING CLOSE TO IT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR EMPLOYEES WHO WORKS THERE TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR SELVES IN ORDER TO SPECIALLY KNOWING. THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER HAVE A JOB BECAUSE THE STORE BEING CLOSED AND WE BELIEVE SIXTY SIXTY FOUR- A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS GIVING THOSE EMPLOYEES AND UP ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO ADDRESS THEIR PERSONAL SITUATION BECAUSE THEY LOSING INCOME BUT ALSO PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO TRANSFER TO OTHER STORES IF IN FACT THERE'S VACANCIES IN THOSE OTHER STORES WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CITY OF LONG BEACH INSIDE OF LOS ANGELES. INTO RICK REGARDING TO THE THIS HERO PAY- THOSE EMPLOYEES CAN NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE CAUGHT UP IN THE IN THE WINDMILL- AND TERMS OF THE RESULTS THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE AS SOON AS THOSE CITIES. PASSED THE HERO- ACT% THAT'S WHEN THEY MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT- I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT NOW SO WE COULD HAVE CAME AT A AT A FUNNY TIME- WOULD THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED THESE STORE CLOSURES IF IN FACT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES CITY OF LONG BEACH. HAD NOT ASKING PUSHED FOR AND WON IN THE COURT SAYING THAT IT'S PERMISSIBLE TO ASK THESE GROCERY STORES TO- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR THESE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IS IT UNREASONABLE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO STEP UP TO WE TALK ABOUT A NOTICE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A NOTICE TO PROVIDE TO EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE TO SHIFT THEIR LIVES WHO HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEIR LIVES THE NOTICE IS NOT GOING TO STOP THE STORE FROM CLOSING. AND THAT'S THE UNDERLYING THIS THE NOTICE TO MAKING SURE THEY HAVE RESOURCES TO THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THOSE WHO RECEIVE EDT BENEFITS THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STORE THEIR CUSTOM TO GOING TO WILL NO LONGER BE THERE. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WHEELCHAIRS TAKING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO KNOW THAT STORE WILL BE CLOSED BOTH OF THOSE DOORS YOU MAKE. MENTION OF LONG BEACH IN LONG BEACH THE FOOD LESS THAN A- MARC. TODAY JUST BECAUSE I THINK THEY CLOSED. LET WEEK SO. WHO ARE TO PUBLIC. HAS NOW PIVOT. TO MAKING SURE THEY CAN FIND GROCERY NEED SOMEWHERE ELSE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A NOTICE. WE CAN'T STOP THE STORE FROM CLOSING BUT WE SHOULD HAVE A OBLIGATION AND A RESPONSIBILITY. TO NOTIFY THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THOSE EMPLOYEES HAVE THE RESOURCES MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO THAT THEY COULD ALSO LOOK FOR EMPLOYMENT. ELSEWHERE HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FEDERAL. THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH IS GOING A STEP FURTHER BY ASKING FOR THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK THAT'S ENOUGH TIME. AND BEFORE I GOT HERE I SAID THAT I WOULD CERTAINLY WORK WITH OF THE OPPOSITION TO COME TO MIDDLE GROUND.
