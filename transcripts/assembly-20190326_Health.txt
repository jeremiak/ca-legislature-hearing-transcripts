A BY THE WAY HAVE USE ACCEPTED OUR AMENDMENTS YES ABSOLUTELY THANK FIFTY MINUTES AND JUST A RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THINKING MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THANKS. THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. ASSEMBLY BILL. FIVE SIXTY FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. BEFORE I BEGIN I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS THE SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS REACHED CRISIS LEVELS. AND CALIFORNIA'S SUFFERING THE FALLOUT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BAY POR EL HEALTH -- IN ITS TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT PROJECTED DEMAND FOR PSYCHIATRY WOULD OUTSTRIP SERVICES BY 25% AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS IT NOW STANDS 55% OF COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE NO PSYCHIATRISTS AND 77%. HAVE A SEVERE SHORTAGE THE SHORTAGE HAS CREATED CRITICAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO PATCH BY EXPANDING THE ROLES OF OTHER CATEGORIES OF WORKERS. HOWEVER A LASTING SOLUTION REQUIRES A MORE SUBSTANTIVE FACTS THAT REVITALIZES THE FIELD IT MUST INCLUDE A POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO STEER PROMISING STUDENTS INTO CAREERS AND COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRY. INSURING OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY PSYCHIATRIC CARE. AB FIVE SIXTY FIVE ADDRESSES THE PSYCHIATRIC SHORTAGE BY TACKLING THE HEAVY BURDEN OF DAT. THAT SO MANY STUDENTS SHOULDER AS THEY PURSUE AN ADVANCED MEDICAL DEGREE IT'S NOT UNUSUAL IN CALIFORNIA TO FIND PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS IN TRAINING WITH DEBT LOADS THAT EXCEED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS BILL EXPAND SUCH PROGRAMS FOR PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO COMMIT TO WORKING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF AB FIVE SIXTY FIVE R. ADRIAN SHELDON FOR WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE AND RANDALL HAGER WITH A CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RANDALL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN SUMMED UP I THINK THAT THE NOT OF THE TYPE REALLY NOT A PROBLEM -- IN CONTEMPLATING A CAREER PATH. EARLY IN MEDICAL SCHOOL MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE THINKING AHEAD ABOUT THE BURDEN THAT THEY WILL INCUR. IN THEIR EDUCATION. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THEM INCENTIVES SO THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD THINKING ABOUT SKYTREE PSYCHIATRY AS WITH PRIMARY CARE IS NOT ONE OF THE BEST REMUNERATED. PROFESSIONS IN MEDICINE. SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE HAVE INCENTIVES LIKE THIS THE SECOND THING ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IF IF STUDENTS ARE DRAWN TO PSYCHIATRY. WE WANT TO FURTHER DRAW THEM INTO PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY WE NEED THEM IN OUR PUBLIC SKYTREE SYSTEMS. DEBT BURDEN -- ON A COUPLE OF RESIDENTS THAT I KNOW OF WHO WANT TO GO INTO PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY HAS REACHED OVER THAT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MARK IN. ONE CASE EVEN -- AS HIGH AS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SOMETIMES THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ARE VERY PUBLIC SERVICE ORIENTED. THEY MAY ACTUALLY HAVE MASTERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH OR M. B. A.'S IN ADDITION TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ADVANCED TRAINING IN PSYCHIATRY AND OFTEN AND THE TRAINING THAT'S REQUIRED IS. IS REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC SERVICE AND COMMUNITY SYSTEMS IS OFTEN IN ADDITION TO AYE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM WHICH LASTS FOR YEARS SO. I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL DIFFICULTIES IN GETTING PSYCHIATRISTS INTO PUBLIC SYSTEMS. AND THIS BILL WILL CERTAINLY HELP DRIVE MEDICAL STUDENTS IN THE SKY TREE AND AND PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER TERRY MEMBERS ADRIN CHILTON WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE ALSO A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. JUST TO ADD A FEW STATISTICS HERE ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION THE JUST COMPLETED THEIR HEALTH WORKFORCE REPORTS OVER 45% OF THE PSYCHIATRIST IN CALIFORNIA. ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY WHICH MEANS THAT OUR CURRENT WORKFORCE SHORTAGES ARE ONLY PROJECTED TO GET WORSE AS I INDIVIDUALS RETIRED. SO MUCH WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES AND LOWER PAYMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY A POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO STEER INDIVIDUALS INTO THE PUBLIC SECTOR. SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. TIM MADDEN REPRESENT A CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RIGHT SPENCER WITH AMERICAN COLLEGE OBGYN IS JUST NINE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. BRANDON MARGIE WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NUMBER BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I SUPPOSE AS WAS A THANK YOU MISTER MAY TEMPERING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH THE NEED FOR PSYCHIATRISTS AND AND CERTAINLY IN PUBLIC -- PUBLIC HOSPITALS WE LEARN TO I THINK THERE'S ABOUT A PUBLIC COST IT'LL SO NECESSARILY AT ALL PSYCHIATRISTS WOULD GO THERE BUT WE HAVE HUGE WORKS WORKFORCE ISSUES AND I KNOW THAT -- THE STAGGERING COST OF EDUCATION IS A BIG COMPONENT AND SO SO I ASKS I AM THANKFUL FOR YOU TO BRING THIS BRING THIS BILL FORWARD WE ARE SHORT OF A QUORUM UNFORTUNATELY -- THE DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION DO YOU HAVE -- WHICH I TO CLOSE AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WHEN WE GET A QUORUM OF WILL BRING THIS AND OTHERS UP THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] MISS EGGMAN. THE SEVEN YOU HAVE. AB. SIX EIGHTY TWO I DO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IN THIS BILL MAY ALSO SEEM A LITTLE STILL DEJA VU. COMMITTEE FOR ME TO MY COME BACK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE -- SO AB SIXTY TWO DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO APPLY FOR FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ESTABLISHING A REAL TIME WEB BASED BAD REGISTRY -- AS WE DEAL WITH OUR PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS THAT IS EVERYWHERE -- THE THE CONCEPT THAT WE NEED MORE BEDS AND MORE RESOURCES IS WITHOUT QUESTION BUT WHAT WE ALSO NEED SOMETIMES IS A MORE DIRECT WAY TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHAT BETTER OUT THERE WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN CRISIS SO WE CAN MORE QUICKLY. I GET PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT. SO A REGISTRY AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS TO CREATE ONE WOULD HAVE EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT MAY COME UP. TO OBJECT TO THIS WOULD BE INVITED IN TO SAY HOW DO WE BEST MAKE THIS WORK -- AND REGISTRY WOULD GIVE A BOOK SO NOBODY COMES INTO -- TO MERGES YOU ROOM THERE IN PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS YOU'VE GOT TO FIND A BED FOR THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE IF THEY ARE DEEMED. TO THE THEY NEED INPATIENT TREATMENT. OFTENTIMES AS ON THE PHONE THAT IS CALLING AT THE SAME TIME SOMEBODY IS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN CRISIS TAKING A BED SPACE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WHEN A MORE SUITABLE -- LEVEL OF CARE WOULD BE INDICATED FOR THEM. THE SOONER WE GET SOMEBODY AND IN PATIENT CARE THE SOONER THEY GET STABILIZED AND THEN WE ALSO CLEAR OUT SPACE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR ACTUAL. CASES THAT NEED MORE MEDICAL EMERGENCY TREATMENT OUT ANY TIME. SO AN ONLINE BED REGISTRY WOULD BE UPDATED IN REAL TIME AS WAYS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE BUT IF YOU NEED SOMETHING MORE SUB SUB USED TO BE A LOCKED FACILITY AT CHILDREN'S BAD UP FEMALE ONLY ALL OF THESE THINGS COULD BE UPDATED IN A REAL TIME ONLINE DATA SYSTEM -- AGAIN THIS IS NOT THE END ALL BE ALL BUT THIS IS A BETTER WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET PATIENTS TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE -- WITH AS LITTLE TIME WASTED AS POSSIBLE -- WITH ME HERE IS I HAVE MISSED RENTAL HAGAR WHO YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM BEFORE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. HI I AM RENTAL HAGER FROM THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC SITUATION THIS IS ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT -- THIS IS SO THIS CONCEPT HERE IS -- I THINK. IT IN IT IS A SIMPLE ONE AND IT REALLY IS CAN CONNECTING A CONSUMERS TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY'RE AT THAT LEVEL OF CARE WHERE THEY NEED AN INPATIENT BAD. OR MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE A RESIDENTIAL BAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- AND THE THE INVESTIGATION THAT I'VE DONE TO TELLS ME THAT THIS IS SIMPLE TECHNOLOGY TO SET UP -- IF YOU CAN SOME SOME IN AND UBER OR LIFT CAR BY A COUPLE TOUCHES ON YOUR IPHONE -- AND OR IF THE HOSPITAL -- CAN UPLOAD DATA ABOUT AN OPENING IN THEIR BED BY COUPLE TOUCHES ON SIMILAR KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY WHY CAN'T WE DO THIS. FOR THIS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT NEED WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE -- TOO FEW -- PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT BEDS -- SO IT'S CRITICAL NOT TO GET ENGAGE AND EXERCISES WHERE YOU GO THROUGH PAPERLESS OR MAYBE. A LIST OF OF THAT MIGHT BE ONLINE BUT IT'S KIND OF A COLD CALLING KIND OF PROCESS -- AND AND HOPE THAT YOU CAN FIND A BED QUICKLY BECAUSE OFTEN PEOPLE WHEN THEY PRESENT IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS OR IN INPATIENT UNITS --ARE AT A LEVEL WHERE WE KNOW WHAT FIFTY ONE FIFTY MEANS THEY MAY BE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR DANGER TO OTHERS. AND THEY REALLY NEED ACCESS TO A BAD TO GET THAT IMMEDIATE TREATMENT SO THAT THEY CAN BE HELPED AND THEY CAN BE -- TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT THREAT OR TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS IN. CAN BE AMELIORATED SO THIS IS OUR PROPOSAL TO DO THAT -- WE THINK IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONALIZATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. CODY BOILS IN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM ADDICTION PROGRAM TO PROFESSIONALS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TO SHOW MUCH ARE WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HUNDRED ALISON SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICANCOLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT. BRANDON MARCHING WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. ADRIN CHILDREN WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE IN SUPPORT. THURMOND DATING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] WHICH TO ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ALEX AUTHOR IN A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS BILL -- WE NOTED OUR LETTER THAT THESE MODELS HAVE BEEN TRIED IN OTHER STATES ON SUCCESSFULLY -- AND WE CAN SET THAT ASIDE AND SAY MAYBE WE COULD MAKE SOMETHING WORKING CALIFORNIA WILLING TO DO THAT -- THE THE PRIMARY CONCERN WE HAVE WITH A BAD REGISTRY IS THE FEASIBILITY OF KEEPING THAT INFORMATION UP IN REAL TIME -- DEAD AVAILABILITY CHANGES CONSTANTLY IT'S NOT JUST NECESSARILY A MATTER OF FIFTH IF THAT THAT IS OPEN OR NOT THERE'S A LOT OF CLINICAL INFORMATION IT HAS TO COME ALONG WITH THAT. AND THAT REQUIRES A CONVERSATION BETWEEN CLINICIANS -- SO JUST KEEPING THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION UP IN REAL TIME IS IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR MY MEMBERS. IN A IN A BROADER SENSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE -- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRIC BEDS WHICH WE DO WE WOULD LOVE TO BUILD MORE -- IN THE STATE WHICH WE NEED TO DO THE CONCERN WE HAVE I THINK MORE BROADLY IS BILLS LIKE THIS MAY NOT CREATE INCENTIVES. TO BUILD MORE BATS -- ACOSTA ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS A DEAD -- MEANT TO CONSTRUCT A PSYCHIATRIC BEDS SO THOSE ARE THE GENERAL CONCERNS WE SHARE THE THE GOALS OF IT WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THE SPONSORS TO INCREASE ACCESS WE HOPE WE CAN WORK ON THAT -- BUT WE ARE OPPOSED TO IT TO THIS MODEL THIS TIME [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHER OTHERS IN [inaudible] OPPOSITION. SEE NO ONE STOP FOR A MINUTE WE'RE GONNA TAKE WE HAVE A QUIRK SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE ROLE. ALLOW US TO DO SOME BUSINESS HERE. TRANSACTION PLEASE TAKE THE ROLE. WHAT HERE MAYES HERE AGUIAR-CURRY [inaudible] BIGELOW. BONTA. BURKE. CARILLO [inaudible] FLORA [inaudible] THE MOST [inaudible] MCCARTY. AARON. RAMOS THERE. RODRIGUEZ [inaudible] SANTIAGO [inaudible] WALDRON. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM IT'S A GOOD THING SO -- BACK -- TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS RODRIGUEZ AND THEN MISTER BIGELOW. IT'S ONLY THANK GOD THE FOR BRING THIS UP BILL FORD I CAN AGREE WITH THEIR ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO. TO IT'S FREE UP SOME THE OUR SPACE THAT THE PROJECT WE'RE GETTING THE FOLKS THE TREATMENT THEY REALLY NEED -- JUST A QUESTION REGARDING -- THE OPPOSITION SEEMING WHAT WHAT IF THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT APPROACH TO A WHAT WOULD BE. A DIFFERENT APPROACH -- VIRGIN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS AND ULTIMATELY GET PATIENTS FOR THE NEED TO GO AND BE THE MERGE ROOMS NOT WHERE THEY NEED TO GO SO I'M. LIKE TO ELABORATE A BIT MORE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YEAH WE COULD WE COULD IT COULDN'T AGREE MORE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- THE ISSUE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS. THAT WE HAVE IS A TOP PRIORITY ISSUE FOR ASSOCIATION IN RESOLVING THAT SITE BOARDING TIMES -- THERE ARE SEVERAL MEASURES UNDERWAY THIS YEAR TO ADDRESS THAT -- WE SPONSOR THE LAST YEAR WITH MISTER SANTIAGO -- THAT WOULD DIRECT THE STATE TO APPLY FOR THE SAME POT OF MONEY UNDER THIS BILL IS SEEKING WHICH IS FEDERAL GRANT. AND WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS SET UP AN INVENTORY OR REGISTRY OF ALL THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS -- WE TEND TO FOCUS ON IN PATIENT ACUTE PSYCH. WITH THERE ARE DOZENS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE OFFERED TO CONSUMERS SO WE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH -- LOOK AT ALL THE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY NOT JUST FOCUS ON THE U. CUTE EVEN THOUGH WE AGREE THERE'S A NEED TO EXPAND THAT SERVICE -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO INVENTORIES AND HISTORIES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THANKS AND I JUST LIKE. TO I THOUGHT THE FROM THIS FOR TELEPORTED SUPPORTED AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME. TO A BETTER WAY WE CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH THANK YOU AND AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING ABOUT THANKS. THANK YOU -- FOR THE AUTHOR. WE HEARD THE OPPOSITION SPEAK ABOUT BILLS NOT BEING. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY BEING AVAILABLE WHEN WE THINK THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE COULD YOU ADDRESS. THAT CONCERN HOW YOUR BILL WOULD REACT AND AND TREAT THOSE SCENARIOS WHEREAS. THE HOSPITAL DOES HAVE A BIG IMPACT BUT TECHNICALLY IT'S NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS HAVEN'T. PLANS TO OR ADDRESS THE ISSUES RESPECTFUL OF THE BET. CERTAINLY MISTER BIGELOW -- AND IT'S IT'S I THINK A A GREAT QUESTION -- BUT UNLIKE THE UBER AND LIFT MODEL. YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE THAT CALL. BUT YOU ARE MORE DIRECTED YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL A WHOLE SHEET OF PLACES WHERE THERE COULD POSSIBLY BE ABOUT OPEN. YOU CALL THE ONE PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW THERE IS BECAUSE YOU STILL NEED TO HAVE A CLINICIAN TO CLINICIAN TALK YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE. THAT'S AND THAT'S PATIENT OVER YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE EXCEPT THAT PATIENT TO THE CONVERSATION STILL HAS TO EXIST IT JUST EXIST WITH MORE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO HAS A BED. RATHER THAN CALLING TWENTY PLACES AND MAYBE THERE'S ONE AND MAYBE THERE'S NOT SO THE CLINICIAN TO CLINICIAN TALK WOULD STILL OCCUR NO MATTER WHAT. THIS HOPEFULLY JUST REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME -- AND EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH YOU CAN GET SOMEBODY PLACED. RIGHT AND AND FOR FOR THE OPPOSITION HOW DO YOU SEE THAT WITH RESPECT. THAT EXPLANATION. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS WE'VE LOOKED TO WHAT HAPPENED IN VIRGINIA VIRGINIA DID A VERY SIMILAR MODEL THEY HAD A MANDATED REAL TIME THAT REGISTRY FOR PSYCHIATRIC BATS. AND BECAUSE KEEPING THAT INFORMATION UP IN REAL TIME IS SO DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. IT WAS ACTUALLY TAKING LONGER TO FIND A BET BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT A REGISTRY THAT WASN'T ACCURATE BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO KEEP IT ACCURATE -- SO WHEN WE AGAIN WE LOOK AT THIS IT'S REALLY THE REAL TIME NATURE OF THIS -- THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO BE IN FEASIBLE FOR OUR MEMBERS TO COMPLY WITH SO LET ME ASK A DIRECT QUESTION IS THERE A MECHANISM BY. WHICH YOU CAN WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THIS BILL. TO RESOLVE IT YOU HAVE SEATED HERE BEFORE YOU THREE OUT OF THREE OF THE EMTS WHO ACTUALLY ARE ON THE GROUND. WORKING IN THIS SCENARIO QUIRK BRINGING FORTH OF PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITAL'S -- MR FLORA MYSELF AND MR INCREASE HERE -- RECOGNIZE THAT WERE FILLING BEDS IN THE E. OURS THAT DON'T NEED TO BE FILLED WITH PATIENTS THAT DON'T REALLY QUALIFY FOR MERCY MEDICAL. THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS WHO HAVE SERIOUS SERIOUS. INJURIES OR OTHER ISSUES THAT THEY'RE FACING. WHERE WE CAN HANDLE THE TYPE OF PATIENTS THAT WERE REFLECTING HERE TODAY IN A IN A MUCH BETTER WAY IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY? CAN YOU WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON FINDING A RESOLUTION FOR THIS. ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO THAT -- ONE THING I WOULD KNOW AND I APPRECIATE YOU YOU RAISING THAT WE DID A STUDY IN ABOUT 70%. OF THOSE IN EMERGENCY ROOMS WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION DON'T NEED TO BE THERE THEY DON'T HAVE AN EMERGENT CONDITION. SO SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS YEAR IS SPONSORING LEGISLATION RUN ALTERNATE DESTINATION GET THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO THE APPROPRIATE PLACE BEFORE THEY COME TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM -- THAT'S ONE APPROACH WORKING ON THIS YEAR BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE COMMITMENT OF OUR ASSOCIATION TO WORK ON THIS AND THAT'S GOOD SO TO THE AUTHOR MAYBE. WHAT IT WILL TAKE A LOOK FOR YOUR BILL TO CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD WHICH I SUPPORT? MAYBE THEY'LL TAKE A LITTLE TIME FOR THEM TO PERFECT OR MAYBE WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE TO HELP PERFECT. HOW WE CAN DIRECT THIS IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY? IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THIS CONVERSATION JUST A LITTLE BIT WE ALREADY HAVE A WORKING MODEL IN CALIFORNIA IT'S ACTUALLY THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT. OF SUBSTANCE USE IS -- IN THE INVENTORY AND IT IS AMAZING -- THAT IS A WILL NOT MY WORD BUT IS THE WORD OF PSYCHIATRISTS WHO WORK RIGHT NEXT DOOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND I THINK WE COULD LOOK AT HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT AND AND HAVE DEVELOPED IT. AND THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR DISCUSSION. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU MISTER SURE OF COURSE OF ANYONE ELSE. THE MOTION BY MISTER MESA SECOND BY MISTER RODRIGUEZ I HAVE COUPLE QUESTIONS SO -- SO. HOW CURRENTLY IF YOU HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH HOSPICES WITH HER MISTER HOPPER? YOU MAY CONTACT WITH A HOSPITAL IN THE AUTHORS WELL OBVIOUSLY -- DO YOU KIND OF RESERVE THAT BAD IN ADVANCE FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE FOLKS UP AND DOWN ORDER HUMBOLDT COUNTY MAY HAVE A FIVE HOUR DRIVE. IN AN AMBULANCE SO SO ONCE YOU MAKE CONTACT. AND AND THAT BAD IS RESERVE SO TO SPEAK UNTIL PEOPLE UP I'M JUST ASKING SO. DOES ANYBODY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. YEAH I THINK IT DIFFERS -- FROM THE PROCESS OF RESERVING A ROOM AT A HOTEL IN THAT THE MOMENT YOU PUSH THE BUTTON THAN THAT BUT THAT BAD SPACES SOLD ESSENTIALLY -- AGAIN I THINK IT'S A THERE IS A A DOCTOR IF YOU WILL A DOCK TO DOCK CONNECTION THAT THAT REALLY SAYS TO BOTH PARTIES THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PATIENT YES WE WILL TAKE THIS PATIENT YOU'VE MADE THAT COMMITMENT. SO I BELIEVE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE COMING FROM YOUR RICA OR JUST FROM YOLO COUNTY TO SACRAMENTO THAT WOULD BE THE ARRANGEMENT. THAT IS THAT HAVE TO HELP PLACE OUT. YEAH IN IN THAT'S CORRECT IN THAT THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A DISCUSSION BETWEEN DOCTORS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT THAT IS APPROPRIATE AND GENERALLY EMERGENCY ROOMS WILL HAVE. A LIST THAT THEY OF OF FACILITIES THAT THEY WOULD CALL TO SEE IF THERE COULD BE AN APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT -- THIS THE HOSPITAL THEY'RE BEING TRANSFERRED TO HAS TO HAVE THE CAPACITY -- AND CAPABILITY TO TREAT THE PATIENT -- AND THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION WOULD HAPPEN WITH THE EMERGENCE FROM CAN WE TAKE THE PATIENT DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT. PROVIDERS WE HAVE THE RIGHT DOCTORS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE PATIENT WHAT'S THEIR NEED -- IT DEPENDS ALSO ON HOW SICK THE PERSON AS THEY WOULD GET PRIORITY. SO RECOGNIZING THAT -- THAT THE IT DIDN'T THE ACUITY OF THE CASE IS IS IMPORTANT AND HOW HOW EVERYTHING GETS PUT PORK. WOULD IT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE SORT OF AN UPDATED REGISTRY BECAUSE OTHERWISE. DID YOU HAVE DOCTORS GOING THROUGH THE TOP OF THE LIST GOING DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LIST EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY TRY TO PLACE A PATIENT. SO WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO KNOW I'M JUST I'M. THAT GUESS WHAT IT'S THIS PLACES FOR THIS PLACE IS FULL OR THEY MAY HAVE BEEN THERE IS AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO START. SO THAT YOU TO SAVE TIME BECAUSE I CAN IMAGINE AT SOME POINT USE YOU RUN TO THE LIST THERE'S AN AVAILABLE BED IT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE BY THE TIME YOU GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT YOU KNOW. DOES THAT. SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING A YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THERE OUGHT TO BE AWAY HERE I MEAN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD I CAN GO ON BOOKING DOT COM AND BOOK A HOTEL ROOM. THANK YOU KEEP TRACK OF THEY KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY ROOMS THEY HAVE AVAILABLE -- AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE SAME BUT I JUST IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN WITH TECHNOLOGY I JUST. KIND OF WONDER IF WE CAN'T AT LEAST SAY OKAY THESE BEDS ARE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE. NOT NECESSARILY COMPLETELY AVAILABLE THERE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE SO THAT YOU HAVE A WEIGHT PLACE TO START RATHER THAN STARTING TO TOPPLE LISTING GOING DOWN EACH TIME. I JUST FEELS LIKE THERE OUGHT TO BE AWAY. SO ANYWAY WE WOULD AGREE -- SO -- WITH THAT IT IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COME MISTER BIG MISTER BIGELOW. I WAS JUST GONNA WIN ON YOUR COMPONENT IT IT DOES GET A LITTLE MORE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED. FOR THE THREE OF US WERE FOUND BY SCOPES AND PRACTICES SURE -- AND LIKE YOU ARE AS A DOCTOR WHAT WE CAN OF WHAT ONE CAN DO AND IN OUR CASE WE GET A A PERSON WITH MENTAL HEALTH. AND THAT PERSON TO PATIENT AND WE'RE TRANSPORTED WE'RE GOING TO WORK OUR INITIAL BASE HOSPITAL. THE NEXT IF THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE THEN IT GOES TO THE NEXT AVAILABLE HOSPITAL. AND SO IT BECOMES VERY COMPLICATED FOR US BECAUSE THAT HAS TO BE THAT REAL TIME CONNECTION OF WHAT THAT LOCATION HAS AVAILABLE. SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE TO GO BECAUSE EACH STEP GETS FARTHER AWAY FROM THE PATIENT AND TREATMENT. AND SO THAT'S THE COMPLICATION WORKING WITH THE HOSPITALS AND THE I AM SEGMENTS BILL. HOW TO BRING THAT TIMING ALTOGETHER? SO I KNOW THE AUTHOR IS WILLING TO WORK ON IT. I'M ENCOURAGED BY REPEAL SO. AGAIN. FOR THOSE FORD OKAY WELL THANK YOU AND AND IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. NO WAS IT'S A THOUSAND EIGHT ONE TIME AS WELL I WAS THE DOING THE TYPE OF JOB WE DO AT THAT TIME I MEAN. IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE FIX WITH TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE JUST MAKE THAT COMMUNICATION. SMOOTH TRANSITION GET THAT PAGE WHERE THEY REALLY NEED TO GO OF COURSE THE END OF THE DAY. THE MURDERS YOUR ROOMS ARE REALLY OVER SUCH OR WITH THE PATIENT THAT DON'T NEED TO BE THERE AND JUST MAKE SURE YOU GET ON WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER SO COURAGE WITH US HE MADE CONTINUE WORK WITH AUTHOR ON THIS AND WE'LL FIND THAT FIX EVENTUALLY THINKING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SEEN NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE AUTHOR QUESTION TO COME IS IT WITH THIS ADDRESS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S THAT'S OKAY ALL RIGHT WE WITH THAT WE WILL -- GO AHEAD AND CALL THE ROLL BUT A SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES AYE MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY?

MISTER KALRA SCENE -- THE NEXT AUTHOR IS NOT HERE PLEASE COME ON I JUST FOR CLARIFICATION ON MISS EGGMAN'S BILL WHICH WAS ITEM NUMBER NINE AB SIXTY TWO THAT MOTION THAT WAS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS SO. JUST. JUST JUST [inaudible] FOR CLARITY [inaudible] PLEASE. THANK YOU MISS SURE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN THIRTY ONE EXPANDS RATE REVIEW PROCESS THE LARGE GROUP MARKET AND ENHANCES THE PROCESS BY CONSUMERS AND REGULATORS A CLEAR PICTURE OF HEALTH CARE COSTS. CYNICALLY REQUIRES MAY REVIEW DATED TO BE DISAGGREGATED BY BENEFIT CATEGORY AND REGION REQUIRES COMPARISON TO MEDICARE PRICES. THE REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS THAT BUILD RAPPORT UNDER EXISTING LAW TO REPORT RATES BASED ON SPENDING AND USED BY TYPE OF SERVICE. THAT STRENGTHENS THE ABILITY TO TO DETERMINE UNJUSTIFIED RATES. IN CALIFORNIA OPINIONS FROM. HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS OF RISEN TUNER 49249% SINCE TWO THOUSAND TO MORE THAN SIX TIMES THE INCREASE IN THE STATE'S OVERALL INFLATION. THE SKYROCKETING COST OF HEALTHCARE IS GOOD SHOOTING TO WAGE STAGNATION AND FEELING INCOME INEQUALITY IN THE STATE BECAUSE WHAT WE PUT INTO OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ULTIMATELY COMPETES WITH WAGE INCREASES AND HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS. CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A RULE ROBUST RATE REVIEW FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE IS. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND HAS SAVED INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS SINCE THE LAW WAS ENACTED. AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE BILLS UPON OUR STAYS PROVEN RATE REVIEW POLICY. SO THERE'S INCREASED SCRUTINY AND PUBLIC ATTENTION ON REASONABLE RATE INCREASES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IN RESPONSE OPPOSITION COMMENTS OF THE LARGE GROUP MARKET IS HIGHLY TAILORED UNFIT FOR RATE REVIEW I'D LIKE TO SUBMIT THAT ONLY POINT 2% OF EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE. HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND HAVE THE POWER TO BY TAYLOR PLANS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF EMPLOYER EMPLOYERS BUY OFF THE SHELF PRODUCTS WITH FEW OPTIONS AND THEY SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE SAME LEVEL REVIEW THAT PUTS A CHECK ON ON REASONABLE RATES. MOVING AND BUILDING UPON RATE REVIEW WELL THE GREATER SCRUTINY ON WHAT IS DRIVING WHAT IS DRIVING RISING PREMIUMS AND PROVIDE NECESSARY RELIEF FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. UNABLE TO AFFORD THEIR HEALTH CARE. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS BETH CAPELL REPRESENTING HEALTH ACCESS YOU KNOW HERE IN TEAMSTERS WALSER FOX IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THESE BETH EL ON BEHALF OF THREE OF THE FIVE CO SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE HEALTH ACCESS TEAMSTERS AND UNITED. MEMBERS WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE COST THE WE HAVE ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING IN CALIFORNIA TO CONTROL HEALTHCARE COSTS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE ENACTED LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE RATE REVIEW FOR HEALTH INSURANCE SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL EMPLOYERS. THAT HAS LITERALLY SAVED CONSUMERS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE MEASURE THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY WOULD EXTEND THIS TO LARGE EMPLOYERS. AND WOULD ASSURE THAT THEY HAVE THIS THE BENEFIT OF THE SAME KIND OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE SAME KIND OF REVIEWS THAT SMALL EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS NOW BENEFIT FROM. WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL YOU GET RICH AND SOMETHING THAT IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IT IS NOT RATE REGULATION YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE THAT THERE ARE HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED PLANS. BUT AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM MISTER KALRA MOST EMPLOYERS HAVE FEWER THAN FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYER WITH TWO OR THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES DOES NOT HAVE MUCH NEGOTIATING POWER. UP AGAINST A HEALTH PLAN THAT HAS EIGHT MILLION ENROLLEES OR NINETY BILLION LIKE ANTHEM BLUE CROSS. SO WITH THAT WE ASSURE AYE VOTE THANK YOU. MR TEAR MEMBERS THERE OF BLOCKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. AND LAST WEEK IN COMMITTEE -- THE COMMITTEE HEARD AB. TWO NINETY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASKED. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT HEALTH PLANS ARE GOING TO TAKE THE SAVINGS FROM PROVIDERS AND PASS IT ON TO CONSUMERS? AND I SAT UP HERE ON THE DYESS AND THOUGHT. AB. SEVEN THIRTY ONE THIS BILL IS HOW WE START TO HOLD HEALTH PLANS ACCOUNTABLE AND SAY WE WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING INTO THOSE PREMIUMS WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THOSE PREMIUM INCREASES ARE JUSTIFIED IN THEIR REASONABLE. AND THAT ANY SAVINGS ARE GETTING PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS AND TO PURCHASERS SO WE CAN PUT IT IN OUR MEMBERS POCKETS IN THE FORM OF WAGES. AND THIS IS A BILL THAT HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN TERMS OF RATE REVIEW WE WANT TO EXTEND THAT TO THE LARGE GROUP SO THAT. PURCHASERS CAN BE ABLE TO SAY HEY THE REGULATOR SAID THIS IS UNJUSTIFIED. LET'S NEGOTIATE NOW WE HAVE SOME DATA SO WE CAN START TO TO LOOK AT PREMIUM INCREASES BUT I ALSO SEE THAT THIS BILL IS NOT JUST ABOUT HEALTH PLANS. BECAUSE PREMIUMS INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE UNDERLYING PRICES CHARGED BY HOSPITALS BY DOCTORS AND BY DRUG MAKERS THAT IS PART OF IT WHAT IS DRIVING UP THE COST OF OUR HEALTH CARE. THIS WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY SO WE CAN SEE HOW MUCH ABOUT MEDICARE IN OUR LABORATORY SERVICES OR OUTPATIENT OR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND HE'LL DO IT BY REGION SO WE CAN SEE IN SAN JOSE WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE HEALTHCARE MARKETS IN THE REGION ACTUALLY IN THE NATION SORRY IN THE NATION. HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO OTHER AREAS OF OUR STATE IS UTILIZATION IS A PRICE SO THIS IS JUST VERY IMPORTANT DATA SAID THAT NOT ONLY PURCHASER SHOULD HAVE NOT I CONSUMERS BUT ALSO POLICYMAKERS? SO WE URGE YOUR I. BUT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHELLE COVERED IT UP WITH A CA YOU CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE AND JUST WANT TO SAY WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS ALSO IS GOOD FOR THE LARGE GROUP MARKET. NOT ONLY HAVE WE SAVED PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AFTER WE STARTED SAVING INSURERS WERE STILL CHARGING A REASONABLE AND I JUSTIFIED RATES UNTIL WE SENT NOTIFICATION. TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY COULD THAT THEY WERE GETTING A RAW DEAL AND THEY COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE JUST WANT THE SAME THING ON THE LARGE GROUP MARKET WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU -- MUCH OTHER SUPPORT. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JACK RUBIN WITH UNITE HERE THE HOTEL CASINO WORKERS UNION ONE OF THE SPONSORS THE BILL AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE A UNANIMOUS VOTE ON THIS BILL.

AND THAT UTILITY WORKERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. I AM ONLY RASH ON BEHALF OF CAL PERK IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU. GEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. IN A MEMO SENT ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORT IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ELENA CENTERING ON BEHALF CONNECTION CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. KEVIN'S GO FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. COVER WITH SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE OPPOSITION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY WILL -- SEVEN THIRTY ONE THIS BILL WOULD SUBJECT THOUSANDS OF LARGE EMPLOYER PRODUCTS TO A RATE. REVIEW REGULATORY PROCESS THAT WILL BE EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER FOR BOTH THE STATE AND HEALTH PLANS. THE BILL ALSO ADD SIGNIFICANT NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON ALL HEALTH PLAN RATE FILINGS -- MEMBERS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT YEAR WHERE WE CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED INCREASING AFFORDABILITY TO COVERAGE -- THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS ARE CAP IS ALWAYS WILLING TO ENGAGE IN CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND COST CONTAINMENT. AS A PRIMARY PAYER OF HEALTH SERVICES IN OUR SYSTEM WE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO BE HELPFUL IN THESE DISCUSSIONS -- UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS NOT A PRODUCT OF ANY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS NOR DOES A NEW IDEA NOR NOR IS IT A NEW IDEA EXCUSE ME. VERSIONS OF THIS BILL HAVE BEEN TRIED A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE PAST AND WE HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED THE IDEA. OF SUBJECTING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LARGE EMPLOYERS AND HEALTH PLANS TO REGULATORY REVIEW. ON IT IT IS INAPPROPRIATE FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE FOR THE STATE TO CHARACTERIZE DECISIONS BETWEEN LARGE SOPHISTICATED ACTORS IN OUR ECONOMY. NO CAP DID REMOVE ITS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THAT -- HEALTHAXIS REFERENCED -- FROM -- TWENTY TEN IN ITS FINAL VERSION A WHICH INITIATED RATE REVIEW IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL EMPLOYER MARKET -- WHILE WE DON'T PARTICULARLY ENJOY THE RATE REVIEW PROCESS AT LEAST IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN THOSE MARKETS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THOSE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY STANDARDIZED. OF THEIR STANDARD PRODUCT OFFERING STANDARD BENEFITS AND BENEFIT DESIGNS IN THEIR COMMUNITY RATED WHICH LIMITS THE NUMBER OF FILINGS TO MANAGEABLE LEVELS. THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN THE LARGE EMPLOYER MARKET. LARGE GROUP IS A CUSTOMIZED IN NEGOTIATED -- AND YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS A DEADLY POINTS OUT THAT -- LARGE GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE IS LARGELY UNDER WRITTEN WITH RATES BASED ON EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION PRIOR CLAIMS EXPERIENCE STORE EXPERIENCE RATING. THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF LARGE EMPLOYER GROUP PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA -- THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE VERY RECENTLY REPORTED THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WERE THIRTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED RENEWING LARGER PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET. AND THAT'S JUST THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE REGULATED PRODUCTS -- WE CANNOT EFFECTIVELY SUBMIT THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS RATE REVIEW AND WE DON'T THINK THE STATE CAN EFFECTIVELY REVIEW THEM -- CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLANS ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF DATA REPORTING LAWS AND OTHER TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS I WOULD I WOULD. THE EVEN GO AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IF NOT THE MOST TRANSPARENT -- SECTORS OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM -- AND THAT INCLUDES THE SUBMISSION OF AGGREGATED LARGE GROUP RATE INFORMATION SO LARGE GROUP RATE INFORMATION IS ALREADY GOING TO THE STATE. VIA SB FIVE FORTY SIX FROM A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO -- CAP HAS SUPPORTED MANY OF THESE TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS WHERE THE BENEFIT CONSUMERS AND THE MARKET. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE POLICYMAKERS SHOULD STRIKE A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN USEFUL TRANSPARENCY AND LAWS A DRIVE UP COSTS FOR LITTLE TO NO VALUE -- THE CAP ALONG WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEEN ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEALTH PAYMENTS DATA REVIEW COMMITTEE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR VIA AB. I'M -- EIGHTEEN TEN WHICH WAS A AUTHORED BY THE BUDGET COMMITTEE OF LAST YEAR -- THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE CASA DATABASE TO BE USED TO INFORM POLICY DECISIONS REGARDING THE PROVISION QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE. REDUCING THE COST OF CARE IN SUPPORTING GREATER HEALTH CARE COSTS TRANSPARENCY -- OUR ASSOCIATIONS BEEN APPOINTED TO THE COMMITTEE ALONG WITH OTHERS AND WE THINK -- THAT THAT IS A BETTER PLACE TO DISCUSS NEW -- REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- SO ON TOP OF EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING CURRENTLY DONE WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A COMPELLING REASON TO NOW REQUIRE LARGE EMPLOYERS TO BE SUBJECT TO RATE REVIEW. ORDER REQUIRE PLANS TO SEND OF VOLUMINOUS AMOUNTS OF NEW PAPERWORK TO STATE REGULATORS AS SUCH WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVEN THIRTY ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU. TELL ME WHY CAN SOME BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TO UNFORTUNATELY HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I THINK THE UNFORTUNATE NATURE OF THIS IS WE DO SEE OURSELVES AS INSURERS AS PARTNERS WITH A LARGE GROUP COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH PRODUCTS. AND RATES THAT ARE AFFORDABLE THAT MEET THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS I THINK MOST RECENTLY UNDER SB FIVE FORTY SIX EDA ALSO HELD A HEARING. AND LOOKED AT THE AGGREGATE OF LARGE GROUP RATE FILINGS I THINK THEY ESTIMATED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL RATE FILINGS THAT THEY RECEIVED AND LOOKED OUT THE LION'S SHARE AT CD I AT LEAST WERE EXPERIENCE RATED. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS THE VOLUME IN TOTALITY OF THESE UNIQUE -- INDIVIDUAL FILINGS WE ALSO SEE OURSELVES AS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH OUR LARGE EMPLOYERS AND SPECIFICALLY SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE REMOVED OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH WE WORKED REALLY HARD WITH THEM TO SEE. TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT WE THOUGHT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING COST AND EXPERIENCE WITHIN THEIR INSURED WORLD AND SO THAT THEY COULD BETTER AND NEGOTIATE THOSE RATES AND ALSO COME UP WITH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. DEBT AND DIFFERENT WRITERS ON THEIR INSURANCE POLICIES TO HELP THEM MANAGE THE UNDERLYING ISSUES AND HEALTH CARE CONCERNS SO WE WE REALLY DO WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AS A PARTNER AND AS MY COLLEAGUE REFERENCED. I THINK UNIVERSALLY MANY OF US ARE SITTING ON THE REVIEW COMMITTEE THE EIGHTEEN TEN ESTABLISHED WITH OUR SPOT TO TRYING TO COME UP WITH A COLLABORATIVE WAY TO LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING COST OF HEALTHCARE. WE THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS A VERY VERY USEFUL WAY OF ALL OF US TO COME TOGETHER IN A COLLECTIVE WAY TO ANSWER THOSE NAGGING QUESTIONS THAT EVERYONE HAS IS WHAT ARE THE COST DRIVERS IN THE SYSTEM. AND I THINK OUR LAST CONCERN AND AND JUST POINTED OUT I'M IN A SEVERAL THE SECTIONS THEY DO REMOVE SOME OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY -- THAT EXISTED IN STATUTES SINCE THE ORIGINATION OF ELEVEN SIXTY THREE THINK WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN AND ALSO THE CONFUSION FOR WHICH IF YOU PUT OUT DIFFERENT RATES AND CONTRACTED RATES -- THAT OTHER INDIVIDUALS WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE RATING NOR WHAT WAS THE DRIVER OF THOSE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED RATE SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RAIN OPPOSE BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AT THIS BILL MOVES FOR TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY OTHER OTHER OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARIN HIGGINS REPRESENTING AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS ALSO IN OPPOSITION. KAREN SARKISIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. MUCH ANYONE ELSE. TO NUMBER BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MISS WALDRON. I GUESS I'LL NEED OFF -- OKAY SO. I WAS LOOKING BACK ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE ACA -- THEY REQUIRED OF THAT A WAIT REVIEW BASICALLY WOULD BE DONE. ON THE SMALLER INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS BUT NOT. ON THE LARGER AND THAT WAS BASED ON THAT EMPLOYERS GENERALLY HAVE A GREATER NEGOTIATING. ABILITY -- AND CHOICE IN THE MARKETPLACE. IN A AND I REMEMBER NEGOTIATING A LOT OF THINGS WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL YOU KNOW FOR THE CITY OF MULTIPLE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES -- EVEN BACK THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES INDICATED THAT -- THOSE PURCHASERS OF LARGE GROUP -- MARKETS HAVE GREATER LEVERAGE TO AVOID ON RATE INCREASES. SO MY QUESTION AND MAYBE I DON'T KNOW START WITH THE OPPOSITION IS. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WOULD IT HEARINGS OF THIS COST BECAUSE DEFINITELY THERE'S A COST IN THAT WOULD SOMEHOW END UP IN A RATES TO I WANT TO SAY. OR DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. HOW DOES THIS? HOW MUCH IMPACT [inaudible] IS IT. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE HAVEN'T IN A SPECIFIC FISCAL ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE -- YOU KNOW ARE ALL LARGE GROUP RATE FILINGS TO BE SUBMITTED -- TO THE STATE -- IT WOULD REQUIRE THE HIRING OF NEW STAFF AT THE AT THE HEALTH PLAN LEVEL IN OF COURSE. WE KNOW THE POLICY MAKERS ARE -- VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATION THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN HEALTH CARE -- WE WOULD SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS ANALYZED -- YOU KNOW SIMILAR BILLS IN THE PAST AND WE CAN GO BACK AND CHECK THOSE ANALYSES OUT -- BUT I THINK YOU YOU YOU RAISE A REALLY GOOD POINT THOUGH IN THAT -- IT ONE OF THE REASONS THE ACA DIDN'T GO IN THIS DIRECTION IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THESE ARE LARGE SOPHISTICATED ACTORS AND THEY ARE PLANS COMPETE FOR THIS BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T GET INTO SPECIFICS YOU KNOW BE IN BEING AT THE ASSOCIATION LEVEL BUT WE HAVE HEARD STORIES OF THEM TRYING TO BEAT EACH OTHER OUT FOR THESE CONTRACTS. WITH THE EMPLOYERS HAVE A LOT OF YOU KNOW THE LARGE EMPLOYERS DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF LEVERAGE IN THIS AREA WHICH IS WHY IT'S IT HAS BEEN CONTEMPLATED A VERY EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE. PARTICULARLY IF IF -- THE STATE HAD THIRTEEN THOUSAND RENEWALS LAST YEAR SO THAT'S THAT'S A LOT. OF RENEWALS -- SO THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK FOR OUR PLANS AND FOR THE STATE'S REVIEW WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THEY WOULD DO IT. WHAT ONE OF THE ONLY THE OTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAVE TO HIRE NEW STAFF THAT'S AN INCREASE TO THE COST OF THE PLANS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE IS ENTIRELY FUNDED THROUGH LICENSING FEES ON HEALTH PLANS SO IT'S A DOUBLE HIT. WE WOULD HAVE TO HIRE INTERNALLY OUR LICENSING FEES WOULD GO UP FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO HIRE NEW STAFF. OKAY. IT'S THE SAME FOR CDI THEY WOULD EXPERIENCE THE SAME INFLUX AND VOLUME THERE MMHM THEIR MARKET SHARE IS A LITTLE SMALLER BUT WITH THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PRESUMABLY A LARGE GROUP FILINGS -- THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL BILLS WHAT IT TALKED ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL STOPPING THE MILLIONS SO IF YOU CAN JUST THINK OF THIS SIZE AND VOLUME FOR WHICH THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HIRE AND BRING ON EXPERTS IN ACTUARIES. THAT'S CERTAINLY A CONCERNED AT THIS WERE USER FUNDED THANK YOU -- FOR FIRST OF ALL TO SUGGEST SOMEHOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE  HAND HUNDRED DATA -- WILL BE IN A SURPRISE TO ME BUT I WILL JUST SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THAT'S FIRST KEEP IN MIND THAT DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE. WHICH I ACTUALLY DID SPEAK BEFORE THEM -- JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND THIS BILL WAS VERY MUCH IN AND THIS IS JOSH WAS VERY MUCH -- BROUGHT UP THERE AND THERE WAS NO CONCERN RAISED IN TERMS OF COST THEM TIME. THEIR BUDGET IS EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OR SO UNDER POINT 1% OF A HUNDRED BILLION. DOLLAR PLUS A COMMERCIAL PREMIUMS. AND LET'S ALSO KEEP IN MIND THE DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE JUST ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL pOVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS MORE SO. THERE'S ABOUT A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAVED BECAUSE OF THIS REVIEW PROCESS. UP ADDITIONALLY LET'S ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT CURRENTLY THE REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL OR SMALL GROUP PLANS REALLY APPLIES TWO HUNDRED OR LESS -- IN TERMS OF PLAYERS THAT ARE UNDER A LASSEN THOSE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES. AB HOWEVER. LET'S FOR THE KEEP MY THE NINETY NINE POINT 8% OF EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE FEWER THAN FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO WHAT. THE COMPANIES WHICH ONE EMPLOYEES HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. NOT NOT EXACTLY THE KIND OF WALES OF THE SYSTEM TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THESE MASSIVE PLANS -- THE PHARMACY TORTILLA THEM -- OR REALLY. THE CHOOSING AMONGST PLANS ARE OFFERED TO THEM AND NOT. HAVING THE ABILITY TO TAILOR A PLAN OF A FOR THEIR OWN NEEDS AND THE REALITY IS THIS LOOK THIS. ISN'T A NEW IDEA IS AN IDEA THAT WORKS. AND AS HAS BEEN WORKING IT'S BEEN WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS BEEN WORKING WITH SMALL PLANS THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO EXPAND IT TO LARGER PLANS. IF IT'S TRUE. THAT THERE THAT THESE. EMPLOYERS. ARE ARE ACTUALLY TRUE PARTNERS. THIS WILL GIVE THE ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE TO TO REVIEW THE RATES DETERMINED THAT'S TRULY THE CASE -- AND IN FACT WHAT WE FIND IS THAT WHEN THERE IS RATE REVIEW IN PLACE OF IT INCENTIVIZE BOTH THE INSURERS AND EMPLOYERS COME UP WITH PLANS THAT WORK FOR EVERYONE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IT'S IT'S ONCE A TRANSPARENCY IS THERE. AND AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE THEY THEY WILL MAKE A STATEMENT AS TO WHETHER THEY BELIEVE THE RATE INCREASE AS BEING REQUESTED IS JUSTIFIED. AND IT'S JUST THAT ALONE THAT THAT THAT PUBLIC -- PRONOUNCEMENT BY ITSELF CAUSES ACTION IN THE MARKET AND THAT'S WAS ALLOWED THEM THEY ARE THEY OF SMALL INDIVIDUAL PLANS TO SAVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IS BECAUSE THE SUBSEQUENT ACTION. AFTER THAT REPORT OUT IS DONE BECAUSE A DOWNWARD TREND IN THE INCREASE OF THOSE RATES SO IT'S SO IT'S REALLY A WINNING SITUATION NOT TO MENTION SOMETHING I KNOW THAT. THE CHAIR IS ON A GREAT JOB AND FOCUSING ON HIS DATA THERE'S ALSO A PART OF PROVIDE A LOT MORE DATA FOR US AS WE GO OF DETERMINING POINTS. AND PRICE PRESSURES ARE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THANK YOU I JUST I HAD THAT -- IF I CAN FIND IT. JUST GOING BACK FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE -- AN INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS WAS ABOUT TEN POINT 6%. WHERE IS THE AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE FOR THE THE SEVEN LARGEST INSURERS IN LARGE GROUP MARKETS WAS? FOUR POINT 8%. SO. THERE IS A VALUE TO THOSE THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT'S GOING ON WITH THE LARGER. ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY ARE LARGER GIVES THEM A BETTER ABILITY ABOUT BUT BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME TO HAVE LOWER RATES. WE WOULD PRESUME THAT IT FOR THE OTHER WAY AROUND. THAT WOULD BE REALLY FISHING. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT PROBABLY THAT IS IN LINE WITH HELD. IS SUPPOSED TO WORK AND THIS IS NOT A GOTCHA YEAH WE'RE NOT OUT THROUGH THE THE THIS BILL IS NOT OUT BE PUT OUT THERE TO TRY TO GO AFTER. THE INSURERS ARE TRYING AND TRYING TO FIND OUT THE YOU KNOW THE BAD ACTORS WE HOPE THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THE RATE REVIEW OCCURS AND EVERYTHING IS GREAT. YOU KNOW BUT THE REALITY IS THAT REPUBLICAN TO BE IT I'D BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOME PRESSURE POINT SOME PRICE POINTS SOME AREAS WHERE WE CAN DO BETTER. AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL ABILITY TO BE ABLE REVIEW THE RATES AMONGST A LARGE GROUPS WHO COVER FAR MORE PEOPLE THAN INDIVIDUAL SMALL GROUP PLANS COLLECTIVELY. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] OTHER QUESTIONS. SO I I DO I DO HAVE ONE AND SO AND I'LL OPEN THIS TO BOTH SIDES SO. YOU YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR COMMENTS -- THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE AN OFF THE SHELF PLAN SO -- AND THEN WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE WERE LIKE. THIRTEEN THOUSAND REVIEWS IT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN. DO YOU HAVE A DO WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT THE HOW MANY BUT THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE THESE OFF THE SHELF PLANS. A REVIEW IS EVERY YOU MEAN. IF IT'S THE SAME PLAN DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA. WELL THAT WAS THAT. IF I CAN DO IS TO FURTHER MY WITNESS I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE A SUGGESTION. THINK OF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BEST FELL FOR HEALTH ACCESS AND TEAMSTERS UNION RIGHT HERE. I WANT TO POINT TO TWO THINGS THE EXPERIENCE OF TRUST FUNDS THAT NEGOTIATE IS THAT THERE ISN'T IT IS. RATHER LIKE BUYING A NEW CAR THERE ARE VARIOUS OPTIONS IN COLORS OFFERED BUT IT'S NOT AN ENDLESS SET OF OPTIONS AND COLOURS AND COLORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE OFFERED. I WOULD ALSO POINT TO THE RECENT REPORT ON THE LARGE GROUP MARKET THAT FIND 70% OF THE LARGE GROUP MARKET JUST COMMUNITY RATED. AND ANOTHER 20% IS A BLEND OF EXPERIENCE RATED AND COMMUNITY RATED. IF SOMEONE IS ONLY 10% IS PURELY EXPERIENCE RATED. SOMEWHAT IN CONTRAST TO WHAT THE OTHER SIDE SAID IN TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN WE BEGAN RATE REVIEW IN CALIFORNIA. THERE WAS NO REQUIREMENT FOR COMMUNITY RATING IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS AND INDEED FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL YEARS TO THE ACA WAS NOT IN A FACT AND SO IF THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL PLAYER MARKETS WERE ALSO EXPERIENCE RATED. SO IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE TO DO THIS IN A MARKET THAT IS EXPERIENCE RATED AND INDEED IN MOST OF INSURANCE. PROPERTY HOMEOWNERS AUTO IT'S EXPERIENCE RATED AND YET THERE IS. RATE REGULATION WHICH THIS BILL DOES NOT PROPOSE THIS BILL DOES NOT SAY THAT THE REGULATOR CAN SAY YES OR NO IT'S JUST TRANSPARENCY. AND SO WE THINK IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE TO DO THIS WE UNDERSTAND. THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T WANT ANYBODY DOUBLE CHECKING THEIR RATES. BUT ONE THOSE OF US WHO ARE THE PROPONENTS REPRESENT. THE CONSUMERS THE TEN MILLION CONSUMERS WHO WORK FOR LARGE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE HAVING RATE REVIEW ENVY BECAUSE THOSE WHO HAVE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL BUSINESS COVERAGE CHAPTER RIGHT CHECKED. THIS TOO IS A SEA OF A SO THE QUESTION WAS A QUESTION OF SCOPE. OKAY -- YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE WAS ONE PROVISION IN SB FIVE FORTY SIX WHICH REQUIRE THE PLANS I IF I'M REMEMBERING CORRECTLY TO REPORT LIKE. WHAT PERCENTAGE WAS -- COMMUNITY RATED VERSUS EXPERIENCE RATED BUT I MEAN EVEN IN LOOKING AT SO LET'S SAY 30%. OF THE MARKET IS A BLEND OF EXPERIENCE RATING COMMUNITY RATED IN 10% -- IS -- STRICTLY EXPERIENCE RATED I MEAN 1010% OF WE WE WHAT DID WE SAY ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PRODUCTS OUT THERE. IS STILL A VERY I MEAN WE'RE STILL TALKING IN THE THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SUBJECT. TO TO RATE REVIEW UNDER THIS SO THERE'S NO LIMITING FACTORS IN THIS BILL AT ALL SO OUR PRESUMPTION THEN OF COURSE HAS TO BE THAT EVERY SINGLE RATE HAS TO BE REVIEWED UNDER THIS BILL. I'M TRYING TO CHANNEL THAT RECENT SB FIVE FORTY SIX HEARING BECAUSE THEY DID HAVE A NICE LITTLE INFO GRAPHIC ON AND WHAT WAS THE COMMUNITY RATED AND BLENDED AND WHAT WAS EXPERIENCE RATED I BELIEVE THAT THE LION'S SHARE AT CDI AT LEAST WAS EXPERIENCE RATED -- BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU I DON'T WANNA MISS STATE ACTUAL NUMBERS BUT I WOULD SAY YOU'RE PROBABLY TALKING AT CD GUY MAYBE AT LEAST A THOUSAND IF NOT MORE INDIVIDUAL FILINGS BUT I GUESS THAT I'D WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE CORRECT ON THAT. BEFORE THE GAME. THANK YOU -- OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM ANYONE -- DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION MISTER KALRA -- RECOGNIZING THAT THERE STILL OBVIOUSLY WORK TO DO HERE -- AND HOPE THAT BOTH PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER -- THIS IS A CHALLENGING ISSUE AND AND YOU KNOW. WHY YOU MIGHT THE WHAT WE MIGHT THINK THE DATA WOULD BE EASY TO GET YOUR EASY TO COMBINE I WOULD SAY THIS THIS YOUR NUMBERS MAKE IT MAKE IT A CHALLENGE BUT I BUT I? ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS VALUE IN THAT DATA SO -- SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR INSIGHT -- BUT I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE. IANS AND PASS ON THIS WILL BE WELCOMED EVEN. BEYOND THIS COMMITTEE HEARINGS THANK YOU AND I WOULD SUGGEST -- IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO OTHER MEMBERS THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE TO AGREE PRESENTATION ON LARGE GROUPS JUST A COUPLE WEEKS BACK UP AND WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE THAT ABILITY I THINK THAT JUST SERVING ON THIS COMMITTEE IT MIGHT BE A HELPFUL THING JUST. TO TO REVIEW BUT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIKE MY VERY MUCH. WE HAVE A MOTION. MR MCCARTY SECOND. SECOND. MR SANTIAGO SEVEN MOTION BY MISTER MCCARTY A SECOND BY MISTER SUN AT SANTIAGO.

THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BECOME THE PUBLIC FACE OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WE SAID WE THINK THIS PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL TO TO REALLY IMPLEMENT THE GOALS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH ARE TO TO PROVIDE A STRATEGY WHERE WE'RE PURSUING PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION.

SO THE HAS NINE VOTES THE CONSENT CALENDAR IS PASS AND SEEN. THIS PETRIE-NORRIS YOU A COME FORWARD I DON'T SEE OTHER AUTHORS SO. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI TEN SIXTY THREE THE PURPOSE OF THIS SPELL IS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AGAINST ON GOING FEDERAL ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL AND THE STATE CHANGE IN STATUTE PRIOR TO MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE CAP COVERED CALIFORNIA PROGRAM THROUGH THE USE OF THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS. THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS ALLOW A STATE TO WAIT EXTENSIVE PORTIONS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. PROVISIONS OF THE ACA THAT CAN BE WAIVED THROUGH THIS PROCESS INCLUDE THE RULES REGARDING THE REGULATION OF QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS COST SHARING REDUCTIONS AND PREMIUM TAX CREDITS AND THE INDIVIDUAL AND EMPLOYER MANDATES. AS PART OF ITS STRATEGY TO UNDERMINE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ISSUED A NEW FEDERAL GUIDANCE AND REINTERPRETATION AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS. DRAMATICALLY RELAXING WAIVER GUARDRAILS. UNDER THE NEW TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GUIDANCE SECTION THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS GIVE STATES THE ABILITY TO WAIT OUT OF OFFERING COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE. OR COVERING A COMPARABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THIS ACTION EXPOSES PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS TO HIGHER PREMIUMS OR LACK OF COVERAGE. THREE INTERPRETATION ALSO ALLOWS STATES TO PURSUE THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR EXPLICIT STATE LEGISLATION. INSTEAD WAIVERS CAN NOW BE AUTHORIZED PER STATE REGULATION OR EXECUTIVE ORDER. IN CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO WAY AND SHOULD ANY MAJOR CHANGES REQUIRING YOUR WAIVER OF FEDERAL LAW BE CONTEMPLATED. AND WHILE WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAY FOR ISSUE ARISING AT THIS MOMENT. WE DO KNOW THAT MOMENTS DO CHANGE AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO FIRST TO SHORE UP THE ACA IN CALIFORNIA TO POTENTIAL THREATS. SECOND TO CODIFY THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN MAKING THESE SORTS OF SWEEPING POLICY CHANGES TO THE ACA. AND THIRD TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES AB TEN SIXTY THREE AT THE NECESSARY LAYER OF PROTECTION TO THE ECA. BY REQUIRING STATE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL FOR SECTION THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT AND I AM PLEASED TO INTRODUCE. TO SUPPORTERS THAT ARE HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURN MEMBERS ANY MISTRUST CAM RANH I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION AND WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB TEN SIXTY THREE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE EXPLICIT LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. BEFORE APPLYING AND SUBMITTING AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WE EVER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TUESDAY INNOVATION WAIVERS ALLOW STATE TO PURSUE. ALTERNATIVE THAT THAT'S A IN PLENTY THAT YOU SEE IN THEIR SEATS AS LONG AS THEY UPHOLD THE ORIGINAL GOALS OF THE ACA. WITH A THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WEAVER STATES ARE ABLE TO AND RED COVERAGE AS LONG AS COMPREHENSIVE AS THE EASY GAME PROVIDE COVERAGE AND COST SHARING PROTECTIONS AGAINST EXCESSIVE OUT OF POCKET SPENDING THAT ARE AT LEAST AS AFFORDABLE AS THE ACA. PROVIDE COVERAGE THE SEMEN RESIDENTS THAT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE ACA. THEY ALSO NEED TO AND NOT INCREASE THE FEDERAL DEFICIT AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL BEFORE DOING SO. UNDER THE NEW TRUMPET ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINE OF THE THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO LEVERS THE STRESS HOLDER REINTERPRETED AND ULTIMATELY -- ALLOWS THE TO SABOTAGE THE ECA WELL WE DON'T EXPECT CALIFORNIA TO REVERSE ALL OF THE GREAT WORK WE HAVE DONE INTO MANY OF THE ACA WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE LEGISLATURE. HAS -- AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ANY PART OF ANY FUTURE THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO CONSIDERATION THE SAME WAY THAT THEY HAD -- A ROLE IN INCLUDING THE ACA FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK YOUR AYE ABOUT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN FLOOR WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- JUST TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TRIED THAT TRIED THIS WITH OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM. AND THEY BEGAN APPROVING WAIVERS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR WORK REQUIREMENTS LOCKOUT PERIODS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT -- PUT PEOPLE'S COVERAGE AT RISK -- AS A RESULT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF ONGOING LITIGATION FEDERALLY AND IN STATES WHERE THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED SUCH WAIVERS PEOPLE OF LOST COVERAGE. IN ARKANSAS FOR EXAMPLE OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST COVERAGE BY THE END OF LAST YEAR -- SO IN RESPONSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED SB ELEVEN OH EIGHT TO SAFEGUARD OUR MEDI CAL PROGRAM AND WE'RE REALLY SEEKING TO DO THE SAME THING HERE FOR COVER CALIFORNIA PROGRAM IN RESPONSE TO THE SAME KIND OF THREAT -- AND THEN YOU KNOW I THINK MOST PEOPLE DO KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN HELD BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND PARTICULARLY BY THE COMPREHENSIVE -- REQUIREMENTS THAT COVERAGE COVER EVERYTHING AND NOT YOU KNOW BE SLIMMER SKINNY INSURANCE PRODUCTS -- AND THEN I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO IMPLEMENT THE ACA. AND IT WAS A LEGISLATURE THAT TOOK THE LEAD THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION. AB TEN SIXTY THREE DOESN'T REQUIRE THE EVERY DETAIL OF A THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVER BE WORKED OUT THREE STATUTE. IT MERELY KEEPS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE LAW WITHIN THE REALM OF THE LEGISLATURE THIS MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO. COVER CALIFORNIA IN THE LEGISLATURE WORKED UNDER SUCH PARTNERSHIP BEFORE WHETHER THROUGH PREVIOUS WAIVER PROPOSAL OR THROUGH THE MORE RECENT AB EIGHTEEN TEN AFFORDABILITY WORKGROUP WHERE THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED COVER CALIFORNIA AT TO PRODUCE A REPORT ON OPTIONS. FOR INCREASING AFFORDABILITY FOR COVER CALIFORNIA AND COVER CALIFORNIA THEN WORKS THROUGH THE DETAILS AND PRODUCED ITS REPORT WE WOULD EXPECT SUCH PARTNERSHIP TO CONTINUE.

TO NEGOTIATE WITH HEALTH PLANS TO ADVANCE DELIVERY SYSTEMS REFORM AND ALSO HEALTH EQUITY. SINCE THE CREATION OF COVER CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS ITS ATTACHMENT SEVEN CONTRACT PROVISION IN TWENTY THIRTEEN PUBLIC REPORTING ON PLAN SPECIFIC CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS ON COST QUALITY. AND HEALTH DISPARITY DATA HAS BEEN THE STATED GOAL. INSTEAD THE FIRST SET OF THE AD THAT WAS MADE PUBLIC WAS IN THE AGGREGATE AND DID NOT SHOW PLAN SPECIFIC RESULTS. THEREFORE THE DATA SHOWED POSITIVE RESULTS AND FINDING BUT BECAUSE THE DATA WAS IN THE AGGREGATE AND NOT PLANT SPECIFIC WE CANNOT KNOW WHICH PLAN ACTUALLY MET THE REQUIREMENTS. AND IF THE ELEVENTH PLAN IN THESE FINDINGS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME PLAN OR A DIFFERENT PLAN -- BECAUSE THE DATA IS INSUFFICIENT AND DOES NOT ALLOW FOR PLAN BY PLAN COMPARE SAN AB NINETY NINE WOULD FIX THIS PROBLEM AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE SUPPORT THANK YOU.

IN -- DIABETES CONTROL NATIONWIDE WHILE THE LOWEST -- PERFORMING PLAN RANK AT THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE NOT BEING ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE PLANS IN THEIR PERFORMANCES CONCERNING BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS. OVER ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA REPORT HAVING ONE OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS ABOUT THREE MILLION ADULTS REPORT HAVING TWO OR MORE. LOW INCOMING -- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR EXPERIENCE DISPARITIES AT A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER RATE ACROSS MANY CONDITIONS FOR EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS -- OF TWICE THE PREVALENCE OF TYPE TWO DIABETES AND ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM THE DISEASE. PLANS AND COVER CALIFORNIA RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR AUTHORITY TO RELEASE MORE SPECIFIC DATA -- BUT THE STATE AS NECESSARY TO DRIVE IMPROVEMENT HOLE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THEIR MEMBERS. OF BREAKING THE DATA DOWN FURTHER WOULD ALLOW US TO SEE WHICH PLANS ARE ARE PERFORMING WELL ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PRACTICE IS IN THE PLANS THAT ARE LAGGING BEHIND. THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLARIFY -- THAT PLANTS MUST REPORT AND REALLY DATA -- TO COVER CALIFORNIA COVER CALIFORNIA MUST PUBLICLY REPORT THAT BY ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS -- HEALTH DISPARITIES IN INEQUITIES CAN ONLY BE ELIMINATED IF THERE'S HIGH QUALITY DATA AVAILABLE TO IDENTIFY MINDER PROBLEMS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS.

I HAVE BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO THE LEGISLATURE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE PASSED A BILL WOULD UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH CHAMBERS. I IT WAS AWFULLY VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO UTILIZE THEIR EXISTING AUTHORITY TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION. FAST FORWARD AND SHOCKINGLY ENOUGH THEY FAILED TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION. IN IN -- WE BROUGHT A BUNCH OF HOLES FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR -- IN WHICH WAS ADOPTED INTO THE ASSEMBLY VERSION THE BUDGET -- BEFORE BEING STRIPPED OUT IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AT THE ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST. SO TODAY WITH A NEW LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND A NEW GOVERNOR. WE ARE BEFORE YOU AGAIN IN THE THIRD ATTEMPT THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES MEDI CAL PROVIDE THE SAME COVERAGE FOR CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS AS MEDICARE. COVERED CALIFORNIA THE MEDICAID PROGRAMS OF MORE THAN THIRTY STATES 90% OF MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM.

TWENTY NINETEEN I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO VOTE I ON AB. EIGHT FORTY EIGHT THIS BILL WOULD MAKE CGM A COVERED BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE OUT BY MAKING CDM AT MEDI CAL COVERED BENEFIT. KIDS LIKE ME IN THE CCS PROGRAM WILL KNOW THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEIR CGM AS THEY MOVE INTO DON'T MEDI CAL. AND ALL PEOPLE WITH DIABETES A MEDI CAL WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE LIFESAVING CGM DEVICE THAT THE PHYSICIANS PROVIDE. I HAVE TYPE ONE DIABETES. I WAS DIAGNOSED EIGHTEEN MONTHS WITH THIS INCURABLE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. BEING NEARLY DIAGNOSE MEANT HAVING TO USE CHEAP TYPES OF INSULIN EVERY DAY TESTING OF COURSE TO TWELVE TIMES A DAY AND LOTS OF INJECTIONS. SHORTLY AFTER I WAS DIAGNOSED I WAS REMOVED FROM MY BIOLOGICAL PARENTS IN PLACE IN THE CALIFORNIA FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. I WAS PLACE IN SEVERAL FOSTER HOMES WHEN I WAS FOSTER WHEN I WAS A FOSTER CARE. LUCKILY ONE FOSTER PARENT HAD TYPE ONE DIABETES SO MADE THE TRANSITION A LITTLE EASIER. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I WAS PLACE WITH AND FINALLY ADOPTED BY MY DAD'S. I THINK GREW OLDER MY PHYSICIAN AND PARENTS DECIDED NEW NEWER TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING THE INSULIN PUMP AND CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITOR WOULD HELP. WHAT BETTER HELP ME MANAGE MY DIABETES? THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE MADE AN AMAZING CHANGE IN MY DIABETES MANAGEMENT. AND HAVE ALLOWED ME TO LIVE HEALTHIER AND DO THINGS AND THAT OTHERWISE I MAY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE.

THE TECHNOLOGY EVEN HELPS ME TO DO SIMPLE THINGS LIKE OVER TO FRIENDS HOUSES AND HAVE SLEEPOVERS WITHOUT ANY WORRIES. THAT'S BECAUSE MY CGM HELPS ME BY ISSUING AN ALARM IN MY BLOOD SUGAR IS DROPPING. LOW SO ME AND OTHERS CAN INITIATE QUICKLY. AND PREVENT SEVERE HAVE HYPOGLYCEMIA OR LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS WHICH CAN RESULT IN MEMBERSHIP FEES AND EVEN DEATH. HOWEVER FOR A PERIOD OF A TIME OBTAINING A CGM IS DIFFICULT FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. MY DAD SPENT HOURS WORKING WITH MY MEDI CAL CASE MANAGER MY DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND THE PHARMACY SO THAT I COULD EVENTUALLY GET THE TECHNOLOGY. WHILE WAITING FOR THE CGM MY BLOOD SUGAR WAS. SOMETIMES UNCONTROLLABLE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT I WAS GOING THROUGH A GROWTH SPURT. FORTUNATELY I WAS VERY LUCKY INDEED GET MY SEJAM BUT I KNOW OTHERS WHO RECEIVE THEIR CARE FOR MEDI CAL ARE NOT SO LUCKY AND I READ THAT WHEN I TURNED. EIGHTEEN I WILL LOSE MY COVERAGE. FOR THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY. I WANT TO TELL YOU DIED BIG DREAMS HAVING ACCESS TO MEDI CAL TECHNOLOGY IS HELPING YOU REACH MY GOALS. BECAUSE WITH GOOD HEALTH IT'S POSSIBLE.

NEW MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY MAKES MEDICAL INFORMATION EASILY AND QUICKLY ACCESSIBLE OF THE APPLICATIONS AND WEBSITES AND CALIFORNIA HAS ENSURE THAT MEDICAL INFORMATION HELD BY MOBILE DEVICES. IS PROTECTED UNDER ALL PRIVACY LAWS. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION DISTANCE INFORMATION GENERALLY NEEDS TO BE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DO YOU HAVE OTHER SINCE IT PEOPLE SUPPORT. IN A SPORTSCASTER OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPPOSITION. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON ALL OF ROCK ROY CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION. ONE OF THE MANY COST DRIVERS AND HEALTHCARE IS KNOWN IT HERE IT'S TO MEDICATION OR SIMPLY PUT. THE CONSEQUENCES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE EITHER NOT TAKING OR IMPROPERLY TAKING THEIR PRESCRIBED MEDICATION. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT WE SPEND UPWARDS OF THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR CARING FOR PATIENTS. WHO HAVE CALLS HIMSELF HARM BY NOT FOLLOWING DOCTOR'S ORDERS? ALMOST 10% OF HOSPITAL VISITS AND A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DEATHS PER YEAR. CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO MEDICATION ON IT HERE IT'S SOME OF THE MOST COMMON CLASSES OF DRUGS NOT TAKEN. OR CANCER. PARKINSON'S HYPERTENSION HEART DISEASE AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL. THE MEDICAL DEVICE BEFORE ME TODAY. COULD HELP SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVE DOWN SOME OF THESE COSTS AND HELP PATIENTS TO BETTER HERE TO THE MEDICATIONS. PRESCRIBED TO THEM. AND IT JUST DOUBLE SENSOR AS IT IS CALLED IS AN FDA REGULATED AND APPROVED MEDICAL DEVICE. THAT IS PRESCRIBED TO A PATIENT AS PART OF THE MEDICATION IF. AND ONLY IF THE PATIENT AND HIS OR HER MEDICAL PROVIDER. DEMAND TO BE MEDICALLY NECESSARY. AND THE PATIENT AGREES. THE TOOL IS DESIGNED TO HELP PATIENTS TAKE BETTER CONTROL OF THEIR OWN HEALTH BY SERVING AS A VIRTUAL NURSE AND PROVIDING A FEEDBACK LOOP THAT CAN HELP A DOCTOR OR LOVED. ONE WITH THE PATIENT'S CONSENT TRACK AND HEARINGS TO MEDICATION. THE SYSTEM WORKS WHEN A SMALL SENSOR. MADE OF NATURAL INGREDIENTS THAT ARE DIGESTED THROUGH THE STOMACH EMITS A SMALL PULSE SHORTLY AFTER BEING SWALLOWED AND DIGESTED. THIS VERY WEAK SIGNAL WHICH IS INVISIBLE AND AN AUDIBLE IS PICKED UP BY THIS PATCH. WORN ON THE ABDOMEN IN TRANSMITTED VIA ENCRYPTED SIGNAL TO A MEDICALLY REGULATED APPLICATION ON A SMART DEVICE. THE RECORDED MEDICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS THE TIME OF INGESTION AND OTHER BIOMETRIC FACTORS SUCH AS HEART RATE. AND TEMPERATURE ARE TREATED AS PERSONAL HEALTH RECORDS IN THE SAME WAY AS A PAPER JOURNAL OR MANUAL LOCK. THE SYSTEM IS HAVE A COMPLAINT MEETS OR EXCEEDS MISSED CYBERSECURITY ENCRYPTION STANDARDS AND IS BACKED BY CLINICAL TRIALS DATA. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS AN EMERGING FIELD OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE COMPANY. THAT HAS ACHIEVED THE RIGOROUS STANDARDS SET BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND OTHER REGULATORY BODIES TO RECEIVE APPROVAL FOR LIMITED ROLL OUT. SINCE RECEIVING THE INITIAL CLEARANCE IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A TOOL FOR PATIENTS AND DOCTORS THAT CAN HELP IMPROVE. TREATMENT OUTCOMES AND RESULTS FOR SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS IT IS A CALIFORNIA SUCCESS STORY. THE COMPANY IS HEADQUARTERED IN REDWOOD CITY WITH MANUFACTURING AND HAD WILL PAY IN HAYWARD BUT VERY MUCH STILL A SMALL COMPANY. IMPOSING ADDITIONAL BARRIERS COULD THREATEN INVESTMENT DELAY NECESSARY PARTNERSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES LOOKING TO PROVIDE VALUE BASED PERFORMANCE METRICS. AND JEOPARDIZE AN IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT IN PATIENT CARE AND COST CONTAINMENT FOR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE BILL IN PRINT TODAY THREATENS THIS AND SIMILAR INNOVATION AND WE MUST THEREFORE OPPOSE THE MEASURE THE WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND HIS STAFF TO FIND AMENDMENTS THAT ACHIEVE THE STATED GOALS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. I THANK LEGISLATION -- FIRST LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH -- COMMENTS IN CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION -- AND ALL GO PRETTY QUICKLY CENTER WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE END HERE -- I THINK YOU COVERED A LOT OF THE THE REGULATORY ISSUES THAT WE THINK WE HAVE THE BILL -- FIRST THE TECHNOLOGY IS HELD. TO A STANDARD ALREADY -- THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION A SECTION FIVE UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY IS FAIRLY BROAD. AND WITH RESPECT TO THE WAY THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES HELD OUT TO CONSUMERS -- IS IS REGULATED WITH RESPECT PRIVACY ALREADY IN THIS MANNER -- ALSO THE FDA'S CENTER FOR DEVICES AND RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH -- EXTENSIVELY REGULATES CYBER SECURITY -- SO WE THINK THERE'S THERE'S AMPLE REGULATION -- IN THIS AREA ALREADY ADDITIONALLY WITH RESPECT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS BILL DOING THE CYBER SECURITY WE WE READ RECENT AGREEMENT WITH. ASSEMBLYMEMBERS IRWIN AND SENATOR JACKSON LAST YEAR WITH A. B. NINETEEN SIX SB -- THREE TWENTY SEVEN TO ADDRESS FDA'S ROLE IN PLAYING AT CYBERSECURITY REGULATE -- DEALING WITH CYBERSECURITY REGULATIONS SO -- WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO LET ME KNOW THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND AND STAFF TO TRY AND WORK ON A WAY FOR WITH THIS WE REALLY APPRECIATE. ALL OF THE SOMEONE BUT CHAO'S -- EFFORTS TO WORK WITH US IN SPEND TIME WITH US LEARNING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY AND THANK HIM FOR HIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ONE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE COULD MISTER MISTER. MY FIRST MEETING ACTUALLY TO HEAR ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ACTUALLY -- WITH -- WITH DOCTOR WOULD AND THIS TECHNOLOGY -- WAS ON A BUSINESS CARD LITTLE CLEAR OF LITTLE TINY LITTLE AND THAT WAS I THINK DOING A GOES IN A PILL. WELL AFTER YOU TAKE THE PILL GOES IN YOUR BODY. AND IT FEEDS BACK INFORMATION IT WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE THOUGHT THAT I COULD EVEN HAPPEN -- AND SO WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND I I THINK YOU'D AGREE SOME OF A CHILD THAT -- THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS -- AND PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION AT TO BE ABLE TO SECURE -- MANY ILLS AND SO JUST MAKING SURE YOU UNDERSTAND -- THAT AND THAT YOU ARE GOING TO WORK WITH FOLKS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WHATEVER REGULATION THAT WE'RE DOING ISN'T GONNA ISN'T GOING TO HARM THEM AS ACT IS A TO HARM INDUSTRY IN THINKING THAT THERE'S THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE THAT'S NOT GONNA -- CAN GET TO DO MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD ABSOLUTELY I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME IS IN FCT A LAWSUIT WEEK I HAD A CHANCE -- TO GO TO ACTUALLY PROTEUS AND HE WORKED ALONG WITH MY TEAM MEMBERS TO BASICALLY OBSERVE. WHAT WHAT THEY DO IN FACT WHEN THE MANUFACTURE THE TRACK AND WAS JUST AMAZING SO? THE BOTTOM LINE CONCLUSION THAT I MADE IS I WANT THEM TO SUCCEED ALSO I WANT THEM TO SUCCEED BECAUSE IF THEY SUCCEED ON CALIFORNIA SUCCEED. SO HAVING THAT HAVING SAID THAT I THINK IT'S A POINT TO POINT OUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE HERE. TO ALL PROTECT ALSO THE PATIENTS INFORMATION JUST THE I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO A JUST TO REITERATE WHAT I JUST STATED AT THE GET GO. AND THAT IS ONE STEP PILL IS INGESTED INTO THE BODY THAT TRIGGERS IN AB OPPOSE IT TO THE PATCH THAT WE USE HAS SAW EARLIER. AND THAT WAS START GENERATING ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S BODY TEMPERATURE OR TIME THE BILL WAS TAKEN A SOURCE OF A HEART RATE AND ALSO ALL. THE ALL THAT INFORMATION OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS PATIENT INFORMATION AND THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE PRIVATE. AND UNFORTUNATELY ON THE CURRENT LAW THAT INFORMATION IS NOT COVER UNDER HIPAA OR CMI AA. BECAUSE THE INFORMATION ONLY INFORMATION THAT'S GENERATED AT THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE OR WHEN IT REACHES THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE WOULD BE CONSIDERED A MEDICAL INFORMATION UNDER C. M. I. A. O. HIPPA. BUT WHEN THAT INFORMATION IS GENERATED BY THESE DEVICES THEN THERE'S THERE'S NO PROTECTION WHATSOEVER BEFORE IT REACHES THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. SUIT THAT'S VERY THAT IS THE VERY NEAR ALL OF THE TIME PERIOD -- ACTUALLY PASSED ON FROM TRYING TO PROTECT I THINK. YOU KNOW I THINK TO PUT MORE PROTECTION AND SECURITY BROUGH PROVIDE TO THE TO THE PALE I THINK IT WOULD MAKE IT A BETTER PRODUCT AND YOU KNOW I THINK THE THIS THE COMPANIES CAN BE MORE SUCCESSFUL SO. SO THERE IS A LANGUAGE THAT HAVE BEEN KIND OF WORKING WILL WORKING ON SOME LANGUAGE ALSO. AND THE IT IN REGARDS TO I MEAN PRIVACY IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS -- AND AT THE MORE AND MORE THEY WERE DIGGING INTO IT THE MORE AND MORE CONCERNING THAT AGES. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION -- IF THERE'S ANYTHING -- THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED IT WOULD BE THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT'S THE THE GREAT FEAR WITH THIS BILL OF THAT WOULD -- AT THAT ARE ARE YOU PUT RIGHT MAYBE I SHOULD ASK IT THIS WAY DO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN -- I'M DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT PRIVACY IS AND HOW TO UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY OF TO HAVE SOME -- OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION ISN'T BEING USED. FOR WAYS IN THE FIRST WITH. IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER MAYES FOR THAT QUESTION -- I THINK THE COMPANY IS IN QUESTION I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE AT THE PIONEER IN THIS FIELD THEY WERE THE FIRST TO DEVELOP IT THEY WERE THE FIRST AND ONLY. TO RECEIVE APPROVAL BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION TO LAUNCH THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT -- THE MODEL DOESN'T WORK UNLESS THEY PROTECT PATIENT DATA THAT IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THAT THERE IS THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE OF THINGS AND THEN THERE'S THE ABILITY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO USE THAT TECHNOLOGY. AND WITHOUT THE MOST STRINGENT COMMITMENT TO DATA PROTECTION. IT WOULDN'T WORK AND THE FDA PROBABLY WOULDN'T GRANTED THEM THE APPROVAL THEY PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE ONE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY THAT THAT IS ENTERED IN THIS PARTNERSHIP SO -- YEAH THE COMPANY IS. CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT PATIENT DATA. JUST JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST TECHNOLOGIES YOU SEE THAT'S OUT THERE THAT TRULY PUTS THE CONSUMER COMPLETELY IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT IT'S A COMPLETELY PATIENT CENTRIC MODEL. YOU SEE SO MANY PRODUCTS OUT THERE UNFORTUNATELY WHERE THE CONSUMERS THE PRODUCT THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF THAT THIS IS A COMPANY -- TECHNOLOGY THAT'S REALLY PIONEERING AND PRIVACY SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE AREA. FORGIVE ME I DIDN'T ANSWER THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION -- THE THREAT. WHEN YOU'RE THE FIRST AND YOU ARE TRYING TO PROVE A CONCEPT -- ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATION ANY CHANGES FROM WHAT THEY WERE ALREADY COMPLYING WITH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ANY ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY SCARES AWAY INVESTMENT -- THIS IS A EIGHT PRIVATELY OWNED COMPANY THEY'RE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED THEY NEED TO GO OUT AND RAISE THE CAPITAL THAT HELPS THEM TO DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY -- THEY'VE THEY'VE RAISED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TODAY THEY NEED TO RAISE MORE BECAUSE WHILE. THEY HAVE ROLLED OUT THE SYSTEM THEY'RE NOT ACTIVELY ON THE MARKET YET -- AND SO YOU KNOW DECISIONAL THREATS OF OR EVEN JUST THE THE IMPLICATION THAT THEY ARE SOMEHOW NOT PROTECTING PATIENT DATA -- COULD THREATEN SOME OF THAT INVESTMENT THANK YOU [inaudible] OTHER QUESTIONS. SEE NONE OF JUST A JUST A COMMENT THAT THE BILL IS DOUBLE REFERRED SO THAT TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION OBVIOUSLY. HUGE CONCERN ABOUT THAT THIS IS MORE AROUND THE POLICY OF THE HEALTH THE HEALTH. POLICY I AM NOT A CYBER SECURITY EXPERT I HAVE A HARD TIME REMEMBERING THE PAST FOR FOR MY IPHONE. SO -- BUT I AM VERY INTRIGUED BY THE CONTEST OLOGY -- ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO SEE WHAT THE INSIDES OF MY BODY LOOKS LIKE. SO -- THE BILL -- DOES INTO IT JOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE STRETCH OUT I'LL BE VERY HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN FACT THESE TWO GERMAN WERE AT THE SITE WHEN WE VISITED PROTEUS AND HE WOULD LAST WEEK SO. SO WHILE WE HOPE HOPEFULLY WILL HOUSE OR SOME KIND OF COMMON GROUND SOME COMMON LANGUAGE -- SHORTLY BEFORE OR SHORTLY AFTER REACHING A PRIVACY COMMITTEE SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER NAZARIAN A SECOND BY MISTER SANTIAGO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. MIDDLE SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES. MAYES NOT VOTING. AGUIAR-CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BONTA. BONTA AYE BURKE [inaudible] CARILLO. FLORA. FLORA NO LONG. LIMÃ³N AYE MCCARTY. IN THIS AREA. THOMAS RAMOS. VEGAS. SANTIAGO SANTIAGO AYE WALDRON. SIX OF SIX WE'LL NEED A COUPLE MORE WE HAVE MEMBERS MISSING SO WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAP. SEEING NO OTHER AUTHORS THIS POINT -- HONEST GUY MR MAYS TOOK OVER AND I WILL PRESENT A BE A TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB. EIGHT I'LL BE PRESENTING AB. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR I'VE BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THE HIGH COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SINCE BEING ELECTED. WHETHER IT'S CREATING TRANSPARENCY IN PRICE HIKES REGULATING EXTREME PROFITS OF OF PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS OR PROHIBITING THE USE OF MARKING COUPONS A PRACTICE USED TO KEEP PATIENTS ON HIGHER BRENT HIGH PRICED. BRAND NAMES WITH EQUALLY EFFECTIVE LOWER COST GENERICS WERE AVAILABLE I'VE BEEN THERE. FIRST AND FOREMOST TO PROTECT PATIENTS BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO FEEL THE SQUEEZE OF EVER INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR IS ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF FIGHTING AGAINST HIGH IN AND WARRANTED PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG COSTS. THIS BILL WILL STOP THE DRUG COMPANIES PROFIT PROTECTING PRACTICE OF PAY FOR DELAY. WE'RE DRUG COMPANIES MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH IN ERIK COMPANIES TO DELAY THE PRODUCTION OF LESS EXPENSIVE GENERIC DRUGS. ONCE THE PATENT EXPIRES. IT WILL DO THIS BY PROVIDING A PRESUMPTION THAT THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BRAND NAME AND GENERIC DRUG COMPANIES ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE. THIS PRACTICE IS COSTING CONSUMERS IMPAIR SUCH AS MEDICARE OUR MEDICARE AND EMPLOYERS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. LIKELY THE PHARMACEUTICAL ENGINEER COMPANIES WILL TESTIFIED TODAY THAT THEY LIKE THE STATUS QUO. THEIR PREFERENCE FOR THE STANDARD THAT WAS SET BY THE U. S. SUPREME COURT. LET ME TELL YOU THEIR STATUS QUO BECAUSE IT TILTS THE BALANCE IN THEIR FAVOR. WHAT IS THAT FAVOR? BRAND NAME DRUG MANUFACTURERS PRO LONG THEIR MONOPOLY WAY BEYOND THEIR PATENTS MAKING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS MORE. AND KEEP IN MIND THIS PRACTICE RESULTS IN GENERIC MAKING -- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS FOR DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WILL CHANGE THAT IT RECOGNIZES THE LEGALLY PROTECT -- PROTECTED RIGHT OF DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO THEIR PATENTS. AND TIME RESTRICTED MONOPOLIES BUT ONCE THOSE PATENTS END CONSUMERS. AND PAYERS SHOULD NOT SHOULDER THE HIGH COST OF THESE DRUGS. I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR AFFORDABILITY. AND COST CONTAINMENT WHEREVER I FIND THE OPPORTUNITY AND I HOPE YOU AGREE THAT THESE PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS MUST END. THIS BILL SPONSORED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOUR VÃ  SERAH I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE -- COUPLE WITNESSES TO AND TO TESTIFYING SUPPORT -- LET THEM GO AHEAD THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON RONALD COLMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR HEALTH ACCESS IS THE STATE WIDE CONSUMER HEALTH COALITION COMMITTED TO QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE WE BELIEVE THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED A BE A TWENTY FOUR TO CRACK DOWN ON THESE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN. DRUG MANUFACTURERS IN GENERIC COMPANIES WHICH DELAY LOWER COST DRUGS FROM ENTERING THE MARKET SIMPLY TO DRIVE UP PROFITS. THIS MEASURE WOULD ENHANCE ENFORCEMENT TOOLS MAKING PAY FOR DELAY PRESUMPTIVELY ILLEGAL SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF IN LITIGATION THUS REQUIRING THESE DRUG COMPANIES TO PROVE THAT THESE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE. ACCORDING TO NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURE DATA WE'RE SPENDING THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS JUSTIN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN SPENDING INCREASES YEARLY AND IT'S CLEAR TO US THAT PAY FOR DELAY IS A PROBLEM IN HOW MUCH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS COST HEALTH ACCESS HAS A HISTORY OF WORKING ON MAKING SURE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR SEX SYMBOL AND AFFORDABLE. WE KNOW THAT AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WILL CERTAINLY HELP WITH SOME OF THESE CALLS FROM SOARING WE COSPONSORED SB TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WE NOW HAVE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AROUND PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. CERTAINLY WHEN PRICES SPIKE 8% A YEAR OR 16% IN TWO YEARS DRUG COMPANIES HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY A COST IS SUDDENLY GOING UP. HOWEVER I'LL TRANSPARENCY LAW DOESN'T IMPACT DRUG PRICES THAT ARE ARTIFICIALLY HIGH BECAUSE OF A LACK OF A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THESE -- WHEN WE HAVE THESE PURPOSEFUL DELAYS OF DRUGS GOING ON TO THE MARKET SIMPLY TO DRIVE OUT THESE COSTS WE BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD A FOR THEIR MEDICAL BILLS WITHOUT GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY? BUT WHEN THESE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CONSPIRE TO KEEP DRUG COSTS IS HIGH. AND AND NOT ALLOW LOWER COST DRUGS GOING TO THE MARKET REALLY HARD WORKING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE SUFFERING AND FORCED TO PAY EITHER OUT OF POCKET OR THROUGH THEIR PREMIUMS. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE -- GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RUNNING COULD GEORGE I'M A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL THIS ERA I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MOVE WOULD FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND HIS LEADERSHIP IN PROTECTING HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS. FROM HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. ATTORNEY GENERAL THIS THERE IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WHICH AIMS TO REDUCE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY INCREASING ENFORCEMENT. AGAINST COLUSA PAPER DELAYED AGREEMENTS. THESE AGREEMENTS ALLOW DRUG COMPANIES TO EXTEND ITS MONOPOLY OVER BRAND NAME DRUGS DRUGS BY KEEPING. LOWER PRICE NERI DRUGS OUT OF THE MARKET FOR CONSUMERS FOR YEARS. I'M DURING THIS DELAY CONSUMERS ARE FORCED TO PAY HIGHER PRICES WHILE THE THE PARTIES TO AGREE THE AGREEMENT THE BRAND NAME. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES READ READ HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS AND EVEN SOMETIMES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT. I'M JUST AN EXAMPLE FOR YOU LA SEVERAL AN ANTIBIOTIC THAT IS TREATED THAT IS OFTEN USED TO TREAT NUMBER OF BACTERIAL INFECTIONS. PAID ITS COMPETITORS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO STAY OFF THE MARKET FOR SIX YEARS. DURING THIS TIME SUFFERS MANUFACTURER BEAR MADE OVER A BILLION DOLLAR IN BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES WHAT WAS THE PRICE IMPACT TO CONSUMERS. SUPER COST OVER FIVE DOLLARS A TABLET BEFORE GENERIC ENTRY AFTER GENETIC GENERIC ENTRY THE PRICE DROP TO LESS THAN TWENTY CENTS A TABLET. SO WHEN DID THESE AGREEMENTS HAPPENED TYPICALLY THEY HAPPEN -- WHEN THERE'S AFTER AT THE END OF A PATENT TIME AFTER A PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT AND WHAT MAKES THEM ODD IS THAT IN THAT CASE THE PLAINTIFF IS PAYING THE DEFENDANT -- AND IS SETTLING THE LAWSUIT BY AGREEING TO TRANSFER SOMETHING OF VALUE TO DELAY ITS RIVAL SALES. OF ITS COMPETING VERSION OF THE BRAND NAME DRUGS THE VALUE THAT THE BRAND TRANSFERS COMES IN MANY FORMS BUT IT CAN INCLUDE -- TRANSFERS OF MONEY PROMISES NOT TO COMPETE IN OTHER MARKETS FORGIVENESS IS OF LIABILITY AND OTHER SUITS ARE TRANSFERS ARE PRODUCTS OF OF LICENSE RIGHT. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S HARD SOMETIMES TO REALLY SUSS OUT -- THAT THESE ARE PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS WHICH IS WHY IT'S SHIFTING THE THE PRESUMPTION IS SO KEY AND SO IMPORTANT -- THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES FOR CONSUMERS AS WE'VE DISCUSSED -- A COUPLE OTHER REALLY QUICK FIGURES I'M A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REPORT BY MEDICARE PAID AT BY NET PACK FOUND THE GENERIC ONES GENERIC DRUGS ENTER. THE MARKET PLACE DRUG COSTS GO DOWN BY 7290%. FURTHER A TWO THOUSAND TEN STUDY BY THE FTC -- ESTIMATED THAT HE FOR DELAY AND GREEN MEN'S COST CONSUMERS THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND I WHAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT THAT'S A TWO THOUSAND AND TEN STUDY SO IT'S ALREADY TEN YEARS THE DATA IS ALREADY TEN YEARS OLD. WE CAN ASSUME THAT THAT THAT THAT PRICE IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF NOT. THIRTY I'M IN THAT SAME TIME PERIOD. AND THIS IS TO GIVE YOU THE SCOPE THERE WERE NINE HUNDRED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS REPORTED TO THE FTC OF THESE AGREEMENTS THE FTC HAS ALREADY. IDENTIFIED MORE THAN A HUNDRED OF THEM TO BE POTENTIAL PAY FOR DELAYED BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE FACE OF THE AGREEMENT. THE ENFORCED AT THE DIFFICULT HERE THAT AND FORSMAN EFFORTS TO GO AFTER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE COMPLEX AND TILTED IN FAVOR OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. ALTHOUGH COURTS HAVE HELD THAT THESE AGREEMENTS MAYBE CHALLENGES ANTI COMPETITIVE AND HARMFUL TO CONSUMERS IS AGREEMENT OFTEN DO NOT RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY FROM THE COURTS BECAUSE THE LEGAL STANDARDS. FOR THESE CHALLENGES ARE TOO COMPLEX PARTY TO THE AGREEMENT HAVE USED THIS COMPLEXITY AND UNCERTAINTY TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO DROP THE LITIGATION ALL THE WHILE RETAINING A MONOPOLY IN THE MARKET PLACE. THE ENACTMENT OF CLEARING EXPRESSED LET LEGISLATION ON PAPER DELAYED REMAINS WILL DETER THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE COLUSA AGREEMENTS AND ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT MORE ROBUST ENFORCEMENT. CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY A LEADER AND BETTER THAT. FERRETING OUT THESE AGREEMENTS AND SHINING A LIGHT THROUGH THE DOJ'S ANTI TRUST ACTION NOW CALIFORNIA CAN BE A LEADER AND STATE LEGISLATION TO DETER THIS HARMFUL CONDUCT. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR PROTECT CALIFORNIANS BY MAKING IT HARDER FOR DRUG COMPANIES TO ENGAGE IN THIS ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR BY MAKING IT PRESUMPTIVELY ILLEGAL TO DELAY. TO ALLOW FOR INCREASED ENFORCEMENT AND DETERRING MISCONDUCT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TME AND CONSIDERATION THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR YOUR AYE THOSE.

SEEING NO FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WILL MOVE -- TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PROMOTION WITH THE ASSOCIATION FOR ACCESSIBLE MEDICINES AM REPRESENTS THE GENERIC AND BIOSIMILAR. MANUFACTURERS. AND WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE AUTHOR IN WHERE HE'S TRYING TO GO WITH THIS BECAUSE I THINK THE DATA THAT YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE OTHER -- ONE PROPONENTS TALK ABOUT. THE BEST WAY TO SAVE MONEY IN THE DRUG SPACE IS WITH GENERICS. IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE TO SAVE TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS THROUGH THE USE OF GENERICS IN THE UNITED STATES ITSELF. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. SB SEVENTEEN REPORTING. GENERICS COMPRISED 90% OF ALL DRUGS PRESCRIBED IN ONLY TOOK MOST EXPENSIVE GENERICS AGAIN ACCORDING TO SB. SEVENTEEN WERE ABOUT 25% OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS 8% OF THE TOTAL DRUG SPEND AND LESS THAN 1% OF HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR. GENERIC COMPETITION IS WHAT WILL BRING DRUGS SAVINGS [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY. WE ARE FINDING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE OF SOME THE ANTICS AND AND SOME OF THE ON GOING WITH THE PATENT HOLDERS THE BRAND DRUG COMPANIES. AND THE EVER GREENING OF PATENTS AND PATENT TICKETS THAT HAS BEEN CREATED. SETTLEMENTS ARE OFTEN ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO GET A GENERIC TO MARKET SOONER THAN THE PATENT EXPIRATION DATE. WE SUPPORT THE INNOVATIVE WORK BEING DONE BY THE BY THE PATENT DRUG COMPANIES WITHOUT THEM WE WOULD NOT HAVE GENERICS. BUT 78% OF ALL NEW PATENTS IN THE ORANGE BOOK OR FOR EXISTING DRUGS. OF THE TOP ONE HUNDRED SELLING DRUGS 70% OBTAINED A PATENT EXTENDING THEIR EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS. IN ONE STUDY THE TOP TWELVE DRUGS BRAND DRUGS HOLD EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT PATENTS. X. SHIELDING THEM FROM GENERIC COMPETITION FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS [inaudible] GENERIC. MANUFACTURERS SUPPORT LAWS THAT STOP THIS TYPE OF PATTON ABUSE. PAN SETTLEMENTS ARE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS GENERIC MANUFACTURERS HAVE IN ENDING THIS EVER GREENING. PROCESS I'D LIKE -- TO JUST DO REAL BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW MANY OF THESE CASES COME ABOUT -- BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S OFTEN MIS UNDERSTANDING. TYPICALLY A GENERIC COMPANY WILL FILE WITH THE FDA FOR APPROVAL -- TO BRING A DRUG TO MARKET. THEY MUST SHOW THAT IT HAS THE SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENT THAT IT HAS BIOLOGICALLY QUICK ONCE IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR WHAT'S CALLED IN PREHEATED NEW DRUG. APPLICATION IN THIS PROCESS THEY HAVE TO CERTIFY. THAT -- HOW THEY ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH ANY POTENTIAL PATENTS IN AND THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT? ONE THEY CAN SHOW THAT NO PAN EXISTS. PATENTS EXPIRED OR PATTON WILL EXPIRE THE WAR OFTEN THE SETTLEMENT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY COME THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED THE PARAGRAPH. FOUR WHERE THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THE PATENTS INVALID OR THEY WILL NOT INFRINGE ON THE PATTERN THAT EXISTS. THE SETTLEMENTS ARE REALLY WHAT'S THAT AGAIN THE FOCUS OF AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR AND EIGHT AM IS PRIMARY CONCERN. WITH THIS IS HOW THIS BILL SEEKS TO PREVENT THE LARGE AN UNEXPLAINED AND REFERS PAYMENTS WHICH MAYBE NOT BE JUSTIFIED. A. M. GREECE WITH THIS. THIS PROCESS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL ACTUALLY CREATES A DISINCENTIVE FOR GENERIC MANUFACTURERS FROM AN AGGRESSIVELY ATTACKING THE PATENT THICKET. THE BILL CREATES A PRESUMPTION THAT THE U. S. SUPREME COURT EXPRESSLY REJECTED AGAIN AND ACTIVISTS. THEY MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT THAT THIS TYPE OF PRESUMPTION WAS NOT NECESSARY. SINCE THE ACT OF THIS CASE MANY OFTHE NUMBERS THAT -- I THINK YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THE PROPONENTS OF ACTUALLY -- BEEN REDUCED IN FACT FROM A HIGH OF THIRTY THREES AND SETTLEMENTS THAT -- THEY CLAIMED. WERE -- RESULTED IN PROBLEMATIC LANES. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ONLY FIVE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONCE YOU SUBTRACT THE IDEA OF THE GENERIC MANUFACTURE BEING ABLE TO COLLECT THEIR LEGAL COSTS -- THE THE PROOF IS REALLY SHOWN THAT ACTIVISTS SINCE ACTIVISTS THESE TYPES OF SUPPLEMENTS HAVE GONE DOWN. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR ELIMINATES ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS AGAINST PATENT THICKETS AGAIN IN TYPICAL CASE IT IS THE BRAND MANUFACTURER WHO IS BRINGING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GENERIC MANUFACTURE. IF WITHOUT CLEAR GUIDELINES GENERIC MANUFACTURERS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY OR WILL HAVE A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TIME. TO ATTACK THE PATENTS. SETTLEMENTS HAVE SAVED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR PATIENTS IN STATES. I THINK. IF I COULD I AND AND I WE HAVE ABOUT TWO MINUTES LEFT I APPRECIATE THAT -- FOR FOR YET. WE SALUTE THE GO AHEAD. YEAH DAHLE JUST KIND OF SUMMARIZE WHAT REAL QUICK -- SOME OF THE THE SUITS THAT ARE SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT SU SHOULD BE ARGUED FINALITY BUT THERE'S INHERENT RISK IN THAT AS WELL SIXTY FOUR OUT OF EIGHTY NINE CLAIMS THAT WENT TO TRIAL FOUND PATENT INFRINGEMENTS. THAT MEANS THAT 70% OF THE TIME THE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS LOST A COURT WHEN THEY LOSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO COME TO MARKET SOONER. IT WILL COUPLE OF FINAL POINTS REALLY IN ALL TO IT VERY QUICKLY AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR ALSO REQUIRES TROUBLE DAMAGES FOR ANY VIOLATION THIS LOAN WILL CHILL SETTLEMENTS AND INCREASED LITIGATION COSTS. THESE COSTS CAN ARE VERY DIFFICULT THEY CAN RANGE FROM THREE MILLION TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS -- AND WHEN FACED WITH THESE COSTS MORE DIFFICULT SETTLEMENT PROCESS A LIKELIHOOD OF LOSING MANUFACTURES MAY SIMPLY CHOOSE NOT TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE. THESE -- PATENTS AND AND TRY TO INVALIDATE THEM AGAIN IN FINAL WRAP UP WITH THIS WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR WE WANT TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY CHURCH DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THAT THIS BILL IS DRAFTED IT'S GOING TO RESULT IN A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO CHALLENGE. PATENTS THE GREAT WITH THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OVER TIME MR STARTED OUT TO DO THIS IN A MINUTE A HALF DO YOU THINK. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS MY NAME IS FRED NO WE'RE REPRESENTING FORMA. INFORM HAS ADOPTED IN OPPOSE UNLESS. UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR AND A FOUR STAR REMARKS I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. AND THE AUTHOR STAFF ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOR MAKING GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF THEIR TIME. TO DISCUSS THIS BILL WITH US BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO FIND A PLACE TO LAND WITH THIS BILL ANTS ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. BUT PATENT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS ARE ALREADY REVIEWED BY THE FTC AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THEY REVIEW THESE SETTLEMENTS TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK FOR PROVISIONS THAT WOULD MAKE THESE AGREEMENTS ANTI COMPETITIVE. THE FRAMEWORK FOR LEGAL REVIEW WAS DEVELOPED BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS A SIMILAR FRAMEWORK. IF THE STATE OR THE FTC BELIEVES THERE ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE PROVISIONS. THEY CAN THEN CHALLENGE THE AGREEMENT AND THEY HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THIS AREA. THESE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CAN BRING GENERIC DRUGS AND BIOSIMILAR. TO MARKET SOONER AND DO NOT EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE PATENT FOR THE BRAND DRUG OR THE BIOLOGIC. THEY ALSO RESOLVED THE GREAT UNCERTAINTY OR RISK FOR THE BRAND AND GENERIC MANUFACTURERS SETTLEMENTS BRING FINALITY AND THE ALLOW GENERIC EQUIVALENTS TO MOVE FORWARD. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON SETTLEMENTS AS THIS BILL DOES NOW MAY PREVENT THESE AGREEMENTS FROM OCCURRING AT ALL. THIS MEANS THAT BRANDON GENERIC COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO LITIGATE THEIR DISPUTE TO THE END THERE WOULD BE NO SETTLEMENT. A RECENT STUDY THAT LOOKED AT LITIGATION FOUND AN INNOVATOR COMPANIES PREVAILED IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES. IF A GENERIC COMPANY LOSES CHALLENGE IT WOULD IT WOULD ENTER THE MARKET. UPON PATENT EXPIRATION NOT BEFORE. THEREFORE THIS BILL MAY HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF INCREASING AVERAGE EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD FOR BRAND DRUGS NOT SHORTENING. WITH THAT SAID. FORMER WANTS TO WORK WITH WE CAN WRAP IT UP MR KNOWING OKAY THANK YOU -- THOUGH I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE MORE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER BILLS YOUR TODAY WE THINK THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO THANK YOU OKAY GREAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER. ADDITIONAL -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THAT IS SHOCKING TO ME ACTUALLY -- FIVE EXPECTING A FEW MORE -- WITH A WILL BRING IT BACK AT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. OF MISTER ROSS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR FOR THIS BILL IT IS MY PLEASURE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD -- IN ALSO LOOK FOR TO ANY UPDATE ON ANY -- FUTURE DISCUSSIONS OVER THE PATIENTS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN THE FUTURE OF AS A STYLUS CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU MISTER TRICK. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. FOR I WANNA JUST FIRST THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE FORD AND FOR ALL OF EFFORTS THAT YOU. HAVE BEEN WORKING ON TO LOWER COST OF HEALTH CARE TO WE ALL WANT AND WE NEED YOUR LEADERSHIP AND I APPRECIATE LEADERSHIP. JUST WANT TO ASK COUPLE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ON A COUPLE PORTIONS OF OF THE BILL -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT SORT OF THAT THE BIGGEST. CHANGES IS THE THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF ANTI COMPETITIVE EFFECTS RIGHT AND THAT'S THAT'S REBUTTABLE CAN BE REBUTTED WITH THAT STANDARD -- THAT'S NO LONGER. THAT PROPONENTS OF THE EVIDENCE STANDARD BUT NOW THE THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING STANDARD SOOKIE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT THE THINKING BEHIND. THAT THE DESIRE TO USE THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING STANDARD. IT'S THE HEART OF THE BILL -- I THINK WHAT THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH THESE WITH THE F. T. C. -- AND HOW THESE SETTLEMENTS ARE MADE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO REALLY -- IS TO PENETRATE TO UNDERSTAND THESE STATEMENTS AND SO -- WHILE I'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THAT THAT THE SETTLEMENTS ACTUALLY MIGHT HELP GENERICS TO GET TO THE MARKET SOONER THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SEEING -- WERE ACTUALLY SEEN -- SO FASCINATED WE HAVE -- THE GENERICS HERE WHO ARE GETTING MONEY FROM SETTLEMENTS TO NOT PRODUCE DRUGS AND THE DRUG COMPANIES HERE BOTH IN OPPOSITION TO THAT THAT THAT TO ME -- IS IS IT IS AN INTERESTING MARRIAGE -- AND SO IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PENETRATE THESE DICK AGREEMENTS TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON SO WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING. IF AS I WAS TOLD OF THAT THESE THE SOME THESE AGREEMENTS ARE PRO COMPETITIVE. THAN JUST PROVE IT TO US IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT -- AND IF YOU YOU KNOW AND THE BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK THAT WAY WHEN A PLAINTIFF SUES SOMEBODY. AND THEN THE PLANE IT PAYS. FOUR IN THE SETTLEMENT THAT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT AND THAT AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THESE DRUGS ARE THESE GENERIC DRUGS ARE DELAYED AND ARE NOT GETTING THE MARKET. AND CONSUMERS. AND EMPLOYERS ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR THAT AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG LONG TIME. SEVERAL OF MY OWN AND THEN I WHERE CURRY. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION FOR BOTH SIDES ON THIS. AND THE OPPOSITION IT MENTIONED IN THE STATEMENT THAT WE WANT TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE WHAT IS THAT SAME PLACE. THANK YOU. PROMOTION WITH A AM. I THINK THE SAME PLACE IS WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING CHANT A GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO COME TO MARKET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD SAY WE AGAIN WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH AND GENERIC COMPANIES ARE NOT IN SUPPORT AS FAR AS THE ASSOCIATION I CAN'T SAY THAT THERE AREN'T SOME OUTLYING CASES BECAUSE THEY DO OCCUR. BUT IF WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THE CASES THAT HAVE LARGE AND UNEXPLAINED MONETARY SETTLEMENTS THAT ARE NOT JUSTIFIED. THOSE CASES SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF AND WE BELIEVE THAT SINCE ACTIVISTS AS HAS BEEN. IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE U. S. SUPREME COURT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE HAVE SEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE NUMBER OF THESE QUESTIONABLE CASES WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND THEN SEVENTY CASES I BELIEVE THAT'S ABOUT 3%. WE DO NOT SIT HERE IN SUPPORT THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THOSE TYPES OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR IS TALKING ABOUT AND SO. TO ME THAT'S THERE THE COMMON GROUND THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO REACH IS LET'S FIND A WAY TO BETTER TAKE CARE OF WHETHER IT'S INSTANT STATE LEGISLATION OR WHETHER IT'S IN -- ON GOING FEDERAL LEGISLATION WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THOSE TYPES OF OUTLYING CASES. THANK YOU WE WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH THAT THAT STATE AND I THINK -- THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THAT WHILE THE INTENTION IS IS LAUDABLE HERE IT'S IT'S MOVING THE NEEDLE TOO FAR THE OTHER WAY. THERE COULD BE A DISINCENTIVE TO ARRANGE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. THANK YOU AND FOR THE SUPPORT I'M IN THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IT'S SAID THAT THERE WAS CONCERN. THAT THIS TILTED IT TOO MUCH IN FAVOR OF THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM TOLD THE TO MUCH IN FAVOR OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ENSURE IT DOESN'T TILT IN FAVOR OF ANY SIDE BUT WE KEEP IT BALANCED. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMB ON I YOU KNOW I THINK RIGHT NOW PART OF WHAT WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT WE HAVE. NOT ONLY WE HAVE A PRESUMPTION SHIFT BUT IN ORDER -- FOR THESE AGREEMENTS TO BE PRESUMED ACT ANTI COMPETITIVE -- WE FIRST HAVE TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF VALUE TRANSFERRED AND THEN WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT THERE ARE -- THAT THAT IT CREATED A DELAY IN -- THE ENTRY OF THE MARKETPLACE FOR THE GENERIC AND THEN IT'S FOR AND THEN IT GOES BACK -- TO IT GOES BACK TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES I'M TO SHOW WHY HESE AGREEMENTS ARE PRO COMPETITIVE -- WHY THEY SHOULD BE PRESUMED ANTI COMPETITIVE SO I THINK WE DO HAVE A GOOD BALANCE RIGHT NOW -- FOR THESE TYPES OF CASES GIVEN THE RESOURCES INVOLVED AND THE EXPENSE INVOLVED IN THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT TAKES BECAUSE I'M BECAUSE THEY'RE SO. BECAUSE THE LITIGATION IS SO DRAWN OUT -- WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO TO SHIP THE PRESUMPTION AS WE HAVE BECAUSE IT'S SO FAR IN FAVOR OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES RIGHT NOW. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEE -- MOVEMENT -- IN THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEE -- TO SEE. GOVERNMENT LIKE THE OJ TO BRING CASES SUCCESSFULLY IN AND AND PREVAIL IN COURT. THANK YOU I GUESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE GET THE MEDICINE THEY NEED AND THEY CAN AFFORD IT -- AND SO THE IDEA THAT IT'S STILL TOO TOO MUCH ON ONE SIDE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER SIDES THERE ARE THAT WE STAY AT A PLACE WHERE WE CAN STILL ACHIEVE THAT AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY. OUR PRODUCT AWAY FROM -- FROM CONSTITUENTS THAT WE SERVE -- I HAVE HEARD IT YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION SAY THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN ME IN IN THE MIDDLE AND I DON'T EVEN IF MIDDLES THE RIGHT WORD WHERE WE CAN. MAYBE MAYBE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT WORD BUT WHERE WE COULD REACH SOME CONSENSUS OR SOME AGREEMENT AND I HOPE -- THAT WERE ARE WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT -- I THINK THAT -- IT WOULD BE IF IF THERE IS A WILLING INTEREST ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE SOME OF THIS IS MANAGEABLE -- NOT ALL OF IT OUT BUT HE EIGHT THINK THAT THERE'S REALLY VALUE IN TRYING TO EXPLORE THAT -- FOR PURPOSES OF IT AS MOVING FORWARD AT AND YOU KNOW BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSTITUENTS GET THE MEDICINE THEY NEED -- AND AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS THIS COULD HAVE -- FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. SENATOR CORY -- DODGE WITH THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL. ARE QUITE FRANKLY I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH TO PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS BEFORE BUT TODAY YOU KIND OF CLEARED IT UP FOR ME AND I INTEGRITY THAT WE NEED TO CRACK DOWN ON THESE CASES AND ABUSES -- DO THESE CASES YOU CAN REALLY SEE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ARE HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE SO HIGH AND IS A MEMBER OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. MOVING FORWARD I HOPE YOU'LL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS WHICH I FEEL ARE MORE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AND I KNOW IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME THERE BUT FIVE ALL MEANS I SUPPORT YOUR BILL ON THIS HEALTH SIDE I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT TO CLEAN UP ON THE OTHER END. SO -- HOPE TO WORK WITH THEM. A SIMILAR CARILLO AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BACK TO BONTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- DOCTOR WOULD AYE MR PRESENTATION CAN WE START OVER. IT'S A LITTLE BREVITY. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT -- AND IMPACTFUL LEGISLATION I TO WANT TO OCCUR ICAL OUR COLLEAGUE. IS NOT AWARE. OF THE PAGE -- DELAY TO PAY. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE INCREASE OF COST. WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW MANY FAMILIES ARE GOING BANKRUPT BECAUSE OF THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS? WE ARE IN A VERY SPECIAL AND UNIQUE TIME TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT FOR CONSUMERS ACROSS OUR STATE AND REALLY LEAD THE NATION ON SOMETHING THAT IS SO IMPORTANT SO PIVOTAL -- TO PEOPLE. I'M CURIOUS -- WITH A. B. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR IF IT SIGNED INTO LAW DO YOU THINK THAT. WE WILL SEE LOWER DRUG PRICES. THAT I'M SORRY FIVE IF YOU ADDRESS THIS NOT NO NOT AT ALL AND I THAT IS THAT IS THAT THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE HOPE -- THE THE IDEA IS THAT IF THIS IS THAT THAT'S AS AS PRACTICE -- DELAYS THE INTRODUCTION OF OF GENERIC DRUGS. IF WE CAN SPEED UP THE PIPELINE ABSOLUTELY CONSUMERS WILL SEE A DECREASE IN PRICES THAT IS THE END GOAL HERE SO -- IF THAT'S THE GOAL THAT WE ALL END UP IN THAT SAME PLACE -- THEN THEN I THINK WE'RE ALL ON THE RIGHT TRACK -- THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO SEE THANK YOU [inaudible] I'M SMARTER. THANK YOU -- DOCTOR WITH THIS IS A SECTION OF THE BILLS THE SECTION BE WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT THE PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT -- IN A IF IF THEY MET THEIR BURDEN THAT THE FACT FINDER SO NOT PRESUME ANY OF THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF THINGS THAT THE FACT FINDER CAN'T PRESUME. LIKE THAT ENTRY INTO THE MARKET PLACE COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE RELEVANT PATENT EXCLUSIVITY THAT ANY PATENTS ENFORCEABLE IN FRENCH COUPLE OTHER THINGS DOES THAT. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S PRESUMED NOW AND THEN AND IT'S BEEN CHANGED OR YOU JUST CLARIFYING THAT -- THE FACT FINDER SHOULDN'T ASSUME THESE THINGS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT ALREADY. OR IT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT. I'M READING IT THAT THE NUMBERS HAVING IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IT'S JUST SORT OF A BLANK SLATE AND THEY'RE GONNA WEIGH THE EVIDENCE AND THEY'RE GONNA SEE IF IT MEETS THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING STANDARD BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT PART RIGHT. RIGHT NOW THESE CASES ARE ALL HANDLED WITH THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SO WHAT WE ARE TO SIMPLE WE'RE SIMPLY DOING IS CHANGING THE PRESUMPTION -- UP FRONT -- NOW I'M I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY -- THERE ARE OTHER ATTORNEYS IN THE ROOM I DON'T IF YOU NOTICE THAT. BUT BUT I WOULD GUILTY ACTUALLY ASKED THE ATTORNEY FROM -- THE TRAIN GENERAL'S OFFICE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU. SO -- WHAT WHAT THIS THAT THIS PROVISION IN THE BILL DOES IS THAT IT -- BASICALLY FOR BED CERTAIN PERCEPTIONS WITHOUT EVIDENCE -- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IN CASES IS THAT -- FACT FINDERS WILL ASSUME THAT IF THERE'S A PATENT THAT IT'S VALID AND WE'RE IN THE POSITION THEN OF PROVING THE UNDER UNDERLYING PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASE WHICH IS NOT THE REASON THAT WHERE IN COURT IN THE FIRST PLACE WE'RE DEALING WITH THE ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR -- AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE PRESUMPTIONS BUT ESSENTIALLY IT DOES CREATE SOMETHING OF A BLANK SLATE I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S TILTED IN FAVOR RIGHT NOW THIS TO MEAN CERTAIN THINGS AND SO WE'RE TELLING THE FACT FINDER. DON'T PRESUME THAT WITHOUT EVIDENCE. THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU. MR FOR DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION AND WASN'T SURE IF NOT. OKAY. SURE IF YOU DON'T MIND IF I COULD IF I COULD GIVE. PERHAPS ONE EXAMPLE IT AT THIS POINT I THINK IT MIGHT HELP CLARIFY SOME OF THE REASONS WHY JUNIOR COMPANIES SURE DO SUPPORT THE ABILITY FOR THESE -- THESE PATENTS IN FACT THE THIS CASE ACTUALLY WASN'T -- JUDICATA BY A TYPICALLY A GENERIC COMPANY BUT WAS A BRAND COMPANIES WHO WAS SUED BY A NOTHER BRAND COMPANY. BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO BRING A BY A SLIM SIMILAR TO MARKET. THEY ENDED UP IN AN AGREEMENT THAT ACTUALLY RESULTED IN ELEVEN YEARS BEING REDUCED FROM THE LENGTH OF THE PATENT. THAT MEANS THAT A BIOSIMILAR FOR THE IN THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE TOP SELLING DRUG IN THE WORLD THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS SPENT BY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. ALONE IN ONE YEAR THAT BIOSIMILAR IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO COME TO MARKET SOONER BECAUSE OF A SETTLEMENT. THOSE ARE PRO COMPETITIVE SETTLEMENTS THAT WE ARE HERE TO TRYING TO TRYING TO PROTECT AND I BELIEVE IS THE GOAL OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALSO OF OF MISTER CHAIRMAN TO PROTECT THOSE TYPES OF SUPPLEMENTS AS WELL. OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE TO GET THIS RIGHT IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT VERY TECHNICAL SECTION OF LAW. IN IF WE GET IT WRONG AND WE START TO DISINCENTIVE EYES THE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. WHETHER THEY'RE A BRAND COMPANY OR A GENERIC COMPANY -- FROM BRINGING THESE PATENT CHALLENGES WE WILL NOT HAVE MORE COMPETITION IN THE DRUG SPACE AND WE WILL NOT REDUCE COSTS AND SO THAT'S OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. SO I THINK MITCHELL I THINK MISS LIMÃ³N WAS TRYING TO GET AT THAT -- AND I WANT TO MAYBE. ASK THAT QUESTION AGAIN MISTER MICHELIN SO HOW DO WE DO THAT -- BECAUSE THE WHAT WHEN I HEAR -- PAY FOR DELAY -- I THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT PRIVATE ACTORS THAT ARE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THE MARKET AS YOU KNOW IN IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THOSE PATENTS WE GIVE PEOPLE A THAT MONOPOLY RIGHT -- BECAUSE OF THE OF OF ALL THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT GOES INTO IT AND KNOWING THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT BUT IT IT. IT THERE'S ONLY A PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH IT ENDS AND OF COURSE IF YOU BEGIN TO MANIPULATE THE MARKET TO YOUR OWN YOUR OWN -- AND THEN THAT'S WHEN GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE TO STEP IN I DON'T LIKE WHEN GOVERNMENT HAS TO STEP IN BUT AT SOME POINT IF THERE'S MARKET FAILURE THAT'S A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT TO COME IN THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ANTI TRUST. A RULES -- A FEDERAL ANTI TRUST RULES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE MONOPOLIES ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE SO HOW DO WE GET TO THAT AND HOW DO WE FIX DO YOU GUYS HAVE A PROPOSAL TO BE ABLE. TO A TO GET THERE. YEAH SO -- SURE LET'S TAKE WITH FARM -- WE'VE BEEN -- MEETING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND AUTHORS OFFICE TO TRY TO GET TO A MIDDLE GROUND HERE. SO PART OF IT IS THAT THE BILL CREATES A FRAMEWORK THAT ACTUALLY DOES THREE THINGS ONE IT'S THE PRESUMPTION THAT THESE ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE. TWO EIGHT RAISES THE EVIDENCE STANDARD TO OVERCOME WHETHER THE AGREEMENT IS NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE AND THEN AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STAFF JUST ALLUDED TO THERE'S A PRESUMPTION SAID THEY JUDGE -- OR THE FACT FINDER IN THIS CASE THERE'S A CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE OR CAN'T MAKE AND IN THE BILL AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND SOMEWHERE BTWEEN THE RULE OF REASON THAT'S THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED THREE SUPREME COURT AND THEN. THE THREE THE THREE PIECES THAT ARE CREE RATED BY THIS BILL THAT PUT A HEAVY HAND ON DETERMINING THAT THESE AGREEMENTS ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE ISN'T ANY THERE'S NOT DISAGREEMENT THE FACT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM -- MY HEARING THAT CORRECTLY THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE ACTORS THAT ARE ACTUALLY BEHAVING INAPPROPRIATELY AND THEY ARE MANIPULATING THE MARKET IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE. WHICH IS WHY WE'VE TAKEN AN OPPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION INSTEAD OF AN OPPOSE POSITION BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET TO A MIDDLE GROUND ON THIS. DOCTOR WHAT ARE JUST AS THE FIRST I'VE HEARD THAT THEM ADMIT THAT THERE ARE ACTORS ACTUALLY. THIS BEHAVIOR SO THAT'S THAT'S A STEP FORWARD I THINK THAT'S PROGRESS REGARDING MR MICHELIN'S COMMENTS THERE'S ACTUALLY EXEMPTION THE BILL THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE HE JUST HE BROUGHT UP. SO -- THE ITEM NUMBER SECTION THAT IS BUT THAT I DO KNOW THAT THERE IS AN EXEMPTION THERE. WITH REGARDS -- TO IF YOU KEEP HEARING THE QUESTIONS ABOUT AT TVS AND AND THAT PARTICULAR BILL -- THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A DIFFERENT -- STANDARD A REVIEW -- AND THE THAT IS THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT -- THAT CASE WE'RE TO SIMPLY TRYING TO ESTABLISH A DIFFERENT STANDARD OF REVIEW -- IF THESE ARE IF THESE AGREEMENTS TRULY ARE PRO COMPETITIVE THEN IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT TO PROVE THEM -- AND SO IF THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING THE OTHER WAY IT'S BECAUSE THE MARKET OR THE THE THE DRUG PRODUCERS WHETHER THERE% AND THIS CASE. WILL LOVE THE GENERICS IN THERE AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING THE SETTLEMENTS IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER. IF THE THEY HAVE HAD THIS PROTECTION FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND AS YOU POINT OUT. WE HAVE PATENT PROTECTIONS THIS IS NOT ABOUT PATENTS AND YOU HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT PADS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PATENTS IT'S ABOUT COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR. AND AND ONE ENTITY TRYING TO STIFLE THE MARKET AND AND **** AND COMPETITION THERE SO -- IT. THAT REALLY IS I THINK GEN IT GERMANE TO THE ISSUE WE'RE NOT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PATENTS IS ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR. AND WE'VE HAD ACTUALLY HEARD FROM FORMER THAT ACTUALLY SAID THAT THEY WERE THEY NOW RECOGNIZE THAT THIS ACTUALLY EXISTS IN THE MARKET SO I BELIEVE THAT'S A STEP FORWARD I THANK THEM FOR ADMITTING THAT. BUT I'D I'D I STILL WHETHER IT'S PAY FOR DELAY IN A CASH FOR OR PAY FOR DELAY IN OTHER FORMS THAT -- ARE DIFFICULT TO CIRCUMVENT OR TO TO TO FERRET OUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND BECAUSE AS THERE HAVE BEEN CRACKDOWNS ON THESE ON THESE BEHAVIORS. THE MARKET OR THE MARK OR THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS HAVE CHANGED THE WAY TEY STRUCTURE THESE AGREEMENTS IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE AGREEMENTS WITHOUT A SUBPOENA TO THE FTC. AND SO WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE SO WE'RE JUST SAYING LOOK IT'S REALLY STRANGE HOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS DRUG WHICH WAS SCHEDULED -- TO THE GENERIC WAS SCHEDULED TO COME IN AND AND AND PRODUCES DRUG HAS DELAYED FOR A YEAR THAT SUSPICIOUS WHY DID THEY DELAY THAT. WE'RE ASKING IS THIS A IS THIS AN ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR AND WHERE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO FORWARD AND ASKED US QUESTIONS IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT -- AT THE END OF THE DAY CONSUMERS CONTINUE TO PAY HIGH PRICES AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES THIS ENTIRE ISSUE. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE AND I'M LOOKING AT MR KNOW WHERE COSTS -- YOU DID NOT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FINISH AND SO IF WE CAN BE QUICK. THANK YOU REAL GROWTH RATE THAT CREATE THE WORDS FROM THE CHAIR. I THINK OUR FEELING IS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE SETTLEMENTS AND HAVE. HAVE NOT DISINCENTIVES. TO ENTER INTO THEM BECAUSE WITH SETTLEMENTS. THERE'S AN AGREEMENT BEFORE THE PATENT EXPIRES WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE GENERIC TO START IN THE MARKET SOONER. AND WE THINK THE WAY THE BILL IS CONSTRUCTED NOW IS VERY WORKABLE WE THINK WE GET TO A POINT BUT WE THINK IT IN IN ITS CURRENT FORM TO DISCOURAGE SETTLEMENTS THANK YOU. DOCTOR WOULD CHEN I'D I'D IF THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A DRUG A SETTLEMENT ALLOWS A DRUG TO INTO THEM A GENERIC TO ENTER MY THE MARKET SOONER. I'M ALL FOR THAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AND THAT WOULD BE A THAT WOULD BE PRO COMPETITIVE. THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO ENCOURAGE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW I'VE ASKED FOR YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE EXAMPLES SHOW ME HOW THAT'S WORKING BECAUSE WE'VE GOT EXAMPLES OF HOW IT HASN'T AND A LOT OF THEM. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AT ALL NONE. MISTER RODRIGUEZ. YES -- ONE THANK GOD FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I WOULD OVERSEEING COURAGE AND CONTINUE WORKING OF OPPOSITION HOPE BECAUSE OF FUNDAMENTAL GROUND -- SO I'LL BE LOOKING TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS LONG AS WE GET A MOVING FORWARD. BUT ALSO RESERVE MY RIGHT TO COME TO THE FORE WHETHER I SUPPORT OR NOT DEPENDING ON THE CHANGES COME ABOUT THE BILL SO JUST WANT. TO URGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING OPPOSITION HOPING I CAN COME IN A MIDDLE GROUND ON SO THANK YOU. I JUST WANT ALSO SAY I'VE I'VE GOT SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE OF THE DATING DISINCENTIVE EYES -- BUT I'M TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS WLL TODAY I KNOW -- THE THAT THE CHAIR UNDERSTANDS THIS ISSUE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT MAKING SURE THAT THE THERE'S NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE -- ANTI COMPETITIVENESS -- IN THE MARKET PLACE TO HELP DRIVE DOWN THAT SEEMS THAT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE SOME WORK TO DO ON THE BILL IT LOOKS LIKE TODAY -- THERE'S JUSTICE -- SOME FOLKS THAT WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE THE BILL BETTER -- SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING -- THE SUPPORTING THE BILL -- SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD JUST SAY THANK YOU I I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- THE END OF THE DAY I JUST ASSUME THAT THIS BEHAVIOR AND WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T BE HERE IF -- IF OF THE DRUG COMPANIES WOULD JUST RESPECT THE PATENTS THAT THEY HAVE IN PLACE ALLOW THE GENERICS INTO THE MARKET AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME SAVE TAXPAYERS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT THE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL -- AND THE MOTION IS -- DO PASSED THE JUDICIARY. WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES AYE MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY? AGUIAR-CURRY I BIGELOW.

LET'S HEAR BACK DOES ABOUT HIM ON THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] MR [inaudible] AS IN. MISSION IS THERE IN WITHOUT ONE MORE BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I'D LIKE TO START. PLEASE BY BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- ABLE SIGNAL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE ABOUT FOUR PAGES. I'LL KEEP IT TO ONLY. TWO I JUST WANT TO GO OVER THE BASIC TENANTS AND AND THEN ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION OVER THIS. ONE THIS BILL -- ESTABLISHES CLEAR REQUIREMENTS ON FARE COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. TO PROHIBITING INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION IN WELLNESS PROGRAMS. I'M SORRY I SHOULD SAY THAT DID AB SIX FORTY EIGHT I HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED THE BILL'S NUMBER WOULD EXPAND CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AROUND WELLNESS PROGRAMS. BY DOING THE FOLLOWING. ONE ESTABLISHING CLEAR REQUIREMENTS ON FARE COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. TO PROHIBITING INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS THREE REQUIRING TRANSPARENCY IN WELLNESS PROGRAMS INCLUDING DATA USAGE AND IN ROWLEY RIGHTS. UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND FOR GRANTING WELLNESS PROGRAM ENROLLEES THE RIGHT TO REVIEW AND CORRECT THE COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY OF RECORDS WELLNESS PROGRAMS ARE PROMOTED AS A WAY. TO SUPPORT HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AND IMPROVE HEALTHY OUTCOMES FOR PARTICIPANTS HOWEVER MANY OF COME WITH UNSPOKEN TRADE OFFS. OF WITH ME IS -- OF DINO MENDELSON FROM CONSUMER REPORTS AND MERRY JUNE FLORES FROM THE HEALTH ACCESS -- I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE FURTHER BUT FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY I'M HAPPY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT AND ALLOW ALLOW THEM -- MY WITNESSES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND ON THE BILL. IT'S GREAT SOUNDS GREAT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WAITED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TINA MENDELSSOHN I'M SENIOR POLICY COUNSEL FOR CONSUMER REPORTS. FOR YEARS WE HAVE WORKED ON THE FRONT LINES OF CONSUMER ADVOCACY ADVANCING A BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION INCLUDING PRIVACY WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR. EIGHTY SIX FORTY EIGHT HEALTHCARE IS COMPLICATED AND SO OUR WELLNESS PROGRAMS. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ON THE PROGRAMS AND THEY CAN BE OPERATED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENTITIES. AS A RESULT THE LAW THAT EXIST ARE INADEQUATE AND ON UNIFORM. CALIFORNIANS TO CONSIDER ENROLLING IN WELLNESS PROGRAM OR WHO ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN WELLNESS PROGRAM. OFTEN HAVE LITTLE WAY TO KNOW THE EXTENSION WITH THEIR DATA WILL BE COLLECTED AND SHARED. FURTHERMORE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT ALWAYS BEAR THE BURDEN OF ENSURING THAT THEIR DATA IT'S NOT MISUSED. INSTEAD WE ARE SPONSORING THIS LAW SO THE BASELINE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OUR ROBOT FOR ALL WHAT WELLNESS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. CONSUMERS HAVE REASON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DATA COLLECTED ON THEM AND HOW IT'S USED. WELL THE PROGRAM'S GIVE EMPLOYER PERMISSION TO ASK PERSONAL QUESTIONS THAT THEY WERE NEVER ASK IN OTHER CONTEXTS. THE JUST MEDICAL HISTORY REPORTER STRESS INCLUDE PROBLEMS AT WORK. SEPARATION OR DIVORCE PLAN TO BECOME PREGNANT. BODY MASS INDEX AND EATING AND EXERCISE HABITS. THIS INFORMATION IS VERY PERSONAL AND COULD HAVE REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES. THIS IS THE START NOT ONLY THAT FOR WEARABLE DEVICES ARE SUPPLIED BY THE EMPLOYER THE DATA COLLECTED BY THE WEARABLE BELONG TO THE EMPLOYERS NOT BE EMPLOYEE. TURNING INTO A TYPE OF SURVEILLANCE AS UNDULY INVASIVE pPURPOSE FOR WITH THE DATA WAS COLLECTED. TO PROMOTE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH. I TO SIMPLY MEMBER MENTIONED DATA COLLECTED BY WHILE THE PROGRAM CAN BE USED FOR PURPOSES UNRELATED TO PROMOTING EMPLOYEE WELLNESS. INCLUDING SECONDARY USE AND SALE. CONSUMERS WOULD ROLL AND RUN THE PROGRAM DO SO TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH. NOT SO THEY CAN GET TARGETED MARKETING. HAVE THEIR ABILITY TO GET INFORMATION THE INSURANCE ALTER OR MAKE PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES KNOWN TO EMPLOYERS POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS OR LENDER THAT ACT OF BAD FAITH. AB SIX FORTY EIGHT WILL LIMIT THE COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA A PART OF ALL THE PROGRAM BY LIMITING DATA COLLECTION. I USED TO ONLY THAT WHICH IS DUE TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM AND BY CODIFY REGRET TRANSFERRED TO STANDARD. SEN REALLY TO ROLL DO SO WITH A FAIR BALANCED INFORMATION WITH CONSUMER PROTECTION ON HEIR SIDE. FOR THIS REASON CONSUMER REPORTS APPRECIATE DRIVE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAMBERS AND JDS HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF AB. SIX FORTY EIGHT ONE THIS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REWARD THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN HEALTHY BEHAVIOR ALREADY. THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE INDICATES THESE PROGRAMS DO NOT ACTUALLY CHANGE BEHAVIORS OF THOSE WHO NEED TO IMPROVE THE MOST. ONE THIS PROGRAMS ARE OFTEN PROBLEMATIC FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES THOSE WHO LIVE IN LOW INCOME AREAS WERE OUTSIDE EXERCISE MAY BE UNSAFE OR INACCESSIBLE ADVANTAGE OF OTHER EXERCISE RELATED ACTIVITIES. THE ALSO TEND TO BE COSTLY. ONE IS INCENTIVES TEND TO WORK BEST FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY HEALTHY AN AFFLUENT RATHER THAN THOSE WHO HAVE SERIOUS CHRONIC CONDITIONS OR WHO ARE LOW OR MODERATE INCOME. AND IN MANY INSTANCES INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ACTUALLY WORSEN HEALTH DISPARITIES RATHER THAN REDUCING THEM WE SUPPORT EIGHTY SIX FORTY EIGHT BECAUSE IT WOULD CREATE NEW CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR HEALTH PLANS AND EMPLOYERS. WE IMPOSE WELLNESS PROGRAMS AND AS YOU HAVE HEARD THESE PROTECTIONS WOULD PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF CONSUMERS PREVENT RETALIATION BASED ON DISCRIMINATION. ON FAILURE TO PARTICIPATING IN WELLNESS PROGRAMS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] YEAH. THANKS TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING A HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED NURSES STATEWIDE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE WORKER PROTECTIONS AND PRIVACY PROVISIONS IN AB. SIX FORTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT OF THE WHOLE THING THANK YOU. OKAY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL THE CALIFORNIA SENATE THINK OUT THERE WORKING SUPPORT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION. HI GOOD AFTERNOON LARA CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THE CHAMBERS CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL -- MOSTLY RELY WITHIN THE EMPLOYEE -- PROTECTIONS AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE EMPLOYER. EMPLOYEE WELLNESS PROGRAMS ARE A BENEFIT THAT ARE OFFERED TO THE EMPLOYEE THERE OBVIOUSLY OFFERED FOR HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF THE EMPLOYEE AND ARE SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADDED BENEFIT. OFTENTIMES THE EMPLOYEE TAKES -- ADVANTAGE OF THE GYM MEMBERSHIP DISCOUNTS THINGS LIKE THAT AND WE ARE AWARE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED TO TAKE THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS. I KNOW THAT THE PROVISION THAT WAS REFERRED TO IN THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS WERE DEALING WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE -- AND SO I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS IN PRINT AS FAR AS THE LABOR CODE PROVISIONS. AND BECAUSE OF THE DISINCENTIVE VICE ATION OF THE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS OF WELLNESS PROGRAMS WE SEE THAT EMPLOYERS WILL JUST ESSENTIALLY STOP OFFERING THESE WELLNESS PROGRAMS. AND BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IMPOSE CIVIL LIABILITY THERE'S ALSO CRIMINAL LIABILITY ATTACHED TO THIS. THERE IS A MISDEMEANOR ATTACHMENT FOR ANY SORT OF VIOLATION OF THIS PROVISION THAT INCLUDES -- A MINOR MISSTEPS SUCH AS NOT PROPERLY PROVIDING WRITTEN EXPLANATION OF THE WELLNESS PLAN. SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT CIVIL LIABILITY UNDER THE LABOR CODE WHICH INCLUDES A PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT WHICH IS KNOWN AS AN S. TO YOUR EMPLOYER TYPE LITIGATION. AS WELL AS CRIMINAL LIABILITY AND WITH THOSE KIND OF THREATS ESSENTIALLY -- FOR AN EMPLOYER THAT WANTS TO PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT THEY SEE AS AN ADDED BENEFIT TO THE EMPLOYEE THERE CENTURY GOING TO STOP DOING THAT FOR THAT SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO ASK YOU A LETTER TO BE EXPOSED THAT TYPE OF LITIGATION. AND SO BECAUSE WILL ONE THIS PROGRAM INCENTIVIZE GOOD HEALTH AND CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHY WORKFORCE AT A TIME WHEN OBESITY AND CANCER ON THE RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE INCREASING WE THINK THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENCOURAGE WELLNESS PROGRAMS WHETHER THAN RATHER THAN TRYING TO DIS INCENTIVIZE THEM THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. TWO REASONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSION INCLUDES US CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS ARE I'LL BE BRIEF -- BE A CHAMBER OF COMMERCE COVERED ALL THE MAIN POINTS. OF COURSE HEALTH PLANS DO WORK WITH EMPLOYERS TO DEVELOP THESE WELLNESS PROGRAMS. AND YOU KNOW THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT -- INCENTIVIZING THE USE OF THESE WELLNESS PROGRAMS INCREASES OUR PARTICIPATION SO WE SO WE WERE HAPPY TO SEE -- A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH RESPECT TO THE REMOVAL OF THE PROHIBITION ON INCENTIVES -- WE STILL MAINTAIN OUR OPPOSE POSITION HOWEVER -- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE SEEN THE LETTER AND SOME OF THE CITY -- ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT -- BY THE SPONSORING SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL WE AT THIS POINT FEEL -- TO UNDERSTAND. WHY -- THE NEW -- PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS POTENTIAL -- FOR FOR LEGAL ENTANGLEMENTS ETCETERA NEW NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ARE NECESSARY IN LIGHT OF EXISTING LAW -- IN OTHER ISSUES -- WHEELS HAVEN'T SEEN ANY EXAMPLES OF OF THIS -- ANY PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA SO I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE WE'VE GOT YOU AUTHORS OFF SO WE CAN SIT DOWN WITH THE SPONSOR IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY -- AND TRY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHY ALL THESE NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE NECESSARY ON WELLNESS PROGRAMS -- WE THINK WE COULD UNINTENTIONALLY OR INHIBIT THE USE OF THESE PROGRAMS WHICH WE WOULD BELIEVE WOULD BE A BAD OUTCOME BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF EXPERIMENTATION IN THIS AREA AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO IN THIS AREA WE THINK WOULD BE BETTER FOR HEALTH AND FOR COSTS. SO AT THIS POINT WELL WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. STEPHANIE WALKING SOME WE HAVE THE SITUATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TO DO YOU THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE MOST RECENT MINUTES UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE STILL POSE TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THREE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISS LIMÃ³N. THANK YOU SO. HE PARTICIPATED IN OUR WELLNESS PROGRAM WHEN I WORKED AT THE UC -- AND I LOVED. AND I DID SO NEXT TO A CUSTODIAN NEXT TO A LANDS A YOU KNOW WORKER MAINTENANCE PERSON AND THEY DIDN'T. THERE WAS INCENTIVE AND THEN SEND YOU KNOW AND I JUST I THOUGHT IT WORKED -- I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT IS ASKED WHEN YOU DO THESE PROGRAMS -- IS INFORMATION THAT IS PERSONAL AND SHOULD BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL -- BUT BUT I I I HOPE WILL CONSIDER WHAT IT MEANS TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I DO THINK THESE PROGRAMS WORK. AND I FOUND THAT EVEN THOUGH I WAS A MANAGER I WS PARTICIPATING WITH VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMPLOYEES AT THE UC -- I FOUND IT VERY HELPFUL AND I LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN SOME OF THE PROGRAMS. YOU KNOW WE DID A UC WALK FOR EXAMPLE WHERE EVERYONE GOES OUT YOU GET FREE LUNCH THAT'S YOUR INCENTIVE -- AND YOU WALK AROUND. THE CAMPUS AND I KNOW IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE STUDENTS RIGHT -- BUT YOU DO YOUR YOUR INCENTIVE IN IT YOU KNOW THE FREELANCE YOU WALK AROUND -- BUT AGAIN I MEAN I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT PERSPECTIVE FROM IT THAT THESE PROGRAMS I DO THINK WORKING -- I ABSOLUTELY AM SUPPORTIVE OF PROTECTING INFORMATION BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT KINDS OF THE I MEAN THE ASK YOU INFORMATION ABOUT PATTERNS AND BEHAVIORS SO I COMPLETELY GET THAT BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE THESE PROGRAMS GO AWAY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY THEY DEFINITELY WORK IN SOME CASES AND THEY'RE DONE. MASS SCALE SO JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I HEARD -- RELATED TO WHO THE PROGRAM IS FOR AND WHO IT FITS -- AND JUST SURE THAT I HAVE HAD A BEARD WELL I HAD AND I WISH WE HAD A PROGRAM HERE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU -- I HAD A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE WITH IT MISTER CHAIR. PLEASE I THINK THAT COMMENT THAT LAST COMMENT WAS FOR YOU MAYBE -- THE THAT AND MATH MISTER COOLEY. I COMPLETELY AGREE I AND AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE THESE PROGRAMS GO AWAY BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE ALSO IN PLACE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. SO IF THERE'S TRANSPARENCY AND IF THERE IS -- THE ABILITY TO REVIEW AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT INFORMATION YOU HAVE PLACE THERE -- THEN. THEN DIDN'T IT DOESN'T REALLY ENTER THE PROGRAM -- THE PROGRAM CAN CONTINUE AND BECOME VERY SUCCESSFUL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ENSURING THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS PROTECTED. SO THANK YOU. I COMPLETELY AGREE. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WILL BRING BACK TO THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE A MOTION BY A MISSILE MONA SECOND BY MISTER RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION.
