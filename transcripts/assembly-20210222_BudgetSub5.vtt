00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.890
COLLEGE PROGRAMS. THESE ARE THE

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:47.024
FACTORS THAT HELP WAS MEASURE

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:48.225
OF THE SUCCESS OF SEASHORE'S

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:50.127
MISSION THAT ANY ONE OF OUR

00:38:50.194 --> 00:38:52.296
PRISONS- STAFF AND- PARTNERS TO

SOCIETY. IF THE PRESIDENT MEETS

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:03.207
THIS CRITERIA THEN IF THEY'RE

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:04.341
GONNA BE STRONG CONSIDERATION

FOR THE PRISONS STATE OPEN WHEN

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.478
COMPARED TO OTHER REASONS WHY

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:08.345
IT MIGHT BE CNSIDERED FOR

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:10.047
CLOSURE. SO THOSE ARE THE

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.682
REASONS WHY TO BE HONEST THE

TIME WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:48.786

YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS CAITLIN

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:54.291
O'NEILL THE LEGISLATIVE

00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:56.393
ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE DO HAVE

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.195
COMMENTS ON THE THREE ITEMS

00:39:58.262 --> 00:39:59.764
WITH IT- THREE ITEMS WITHIN

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.600
THIS ISSUE I'LL START WITH THE

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.835
CLOSURE OF DV I HAVE ARE WE

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:06.604
HAVE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS ON

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.606
THAT TOPIC. THE FIRST IS THAT

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:09.306
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:11.342
LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.110
THE BUDGET ADJUSTMENT RELATED

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:14.845
TO THE CLOSURE GIVEN THAT THE

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:17.314
ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO ADJUST

00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:19.316
THAT ESTIMATE AT THE ME REVISED

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:21.719
WHEN IT HAS MORE INFORMATION AT

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:23.854
THAT TIME. A SECOND WE THINK

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:24.889
THAT THE TWELVE POSITIONS

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:25.856
REQUESTED TO SUPPORT THE

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.024
WEREN'T SHUT DOWN OF THE

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.326
FACILITY APPEAR EXCESSIVE.

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:29.860
GIVEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:31.796
CURRENTLY USES ONLY TWO

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:33.230
POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE WARM

00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:34.698
SHUT DOWN OF ANOTHER PERSON

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.433
THAT'S CURRENTLY CLOSED-

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.135
WELCOME KNOWLEDGE THAT DVI IS A

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:40.538
LARGER FACILITY- AND WOULD

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:41.472
PROBABLY NEED MORE THAN TWO

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:44.708
RESOURCES. ARE TWO POSITIONS.

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.177
FOR ITS MORE SHUT DOWN THE

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:47.545
DEPARTMENT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:48.746
JUSTIFY THE FULL TWELVE

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.181
POSITIONS IN OTHER WORDS WHY IT

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:52.650
NEEDS A FULL SIX TIMES- WHAT IT

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.518
USES TO SUPPORT ANOTHER PERSON.

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:57.321
WE THINK FIVE POSITIONS WOULD

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.356
BE REASONABLE SO WE RECOMMEND.

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:01.826
REJECT SEVEN POSITIONS- WHICH

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:05.029
WOULD REDUCE THE REQUEST BY

00:41:05.095 --> 00:41:05.529
EIGHT SIX HUNDRED FORTY

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:07.965
THOUSAND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:08.566
EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:11.635
ANNUALLY THEREAFTER. THIRD THE

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:13.571
ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF DV I

00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:14.772
AND THE SECOND POSITION AT

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.974
PRESENT NOT SCHEDULE SCHEDULED

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:20.110
FOR CLOSURE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:20.711
TWENTY THREE IT'S UNCLEAR AT

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.613
THIS TIME SO IT'S NOT CLEAR IF

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.814
THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE WILL SELL

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:26.217
THOSE FACILITIES. AND THEREFORE

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:27.685
ELIMINATING THE NEED TO FUND

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:28.853
THE WARM SHUT DOWN OR SELL

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:30.421
CONTINUE TO BE A STATE NEED FOR

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:32.489
THEM SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:41:32.556 --> 00:41:34.658
LEGISLATURE- DIRECTOR

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:36.894
DEPARTMENT TO REPORT. BY

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:38.596
JANUARY TENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:39.597
TWO AND WHAT OPTIONS IT'S

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.899
CONSIDERING FOR THE ALTERNATIVE

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:43.868
DISPOSITION OF THOSE PRISONS-

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.169
WE THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:46.537
THIS AND GETTING THE BALL

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:47.972
ROLLING UP ROLLING ON THAT

00:41:48.038 --> 00:41:49.540
DOING THAT THINKING WOULD HELP

00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:51.642
AVOID UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:54.111
THEREFORE UNNECESSARY SPENDING

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:56.280
ON WARM. CHECK OUT. REGARDING

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:57.882
THE PROPOSED A HEALTHCARE

00:41:57.948 --> 00:41:59.250
FACILITY REPAIRS AT THE

00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:00.417
CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION

00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:04.088
CENTER IN NORCO- THE PROJECT HE

00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:04.922
C. R. INDICATES THAT THE

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:06.457
PROJECT WOULD BE COMPLETED AND

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:10.194
TELLS. A FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:11.729
THREE AND AT THAT POINT BASED

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:13.697
ON CDC OURS OWN PROJECTIONS OF

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:15.065
THE INMATE POPULATION IT'S

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:16.533
POSSIBLE THAT THE STATE COULD

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.769
BE IN A POSITION TO. BE CLOSING

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:21.305
ITS THIRD PRISON FIVE FALL

00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:24.408
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO AND WE

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.977
UNDERSTAND THAT- C. OR C. MAY

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:29.313
BE IN A GOOD LOCATION AND HAVE.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.483
SOME THINGS GOING FOR IT BUT-

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.218
IT AT THIS POINT THE DEPARTMENT

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:36.420
HASN'T PUT FORWARD A PLAN- TO

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.122
ACT TO DEAL WITH THE FULL SCOPE

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:39.156
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:42.159
THAT C. OR C. SO. WE DON'T

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.161
REGARD THAT AS A LONG TERM OR

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:45.963
IN OTHER WORDS WE DON'T REGARD-

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.332
MINIMAL FIXES OR TEMPORARY.

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:49.967
PATCHES ESSENTIALLY ON THE

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:51.335
HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AT SEARS

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:52.870
SEE WHICH IS WHAT IS PROPOSED

00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:56.907
EFFECTIVELY AS A LONG TERM.

00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:59.109
PLAN FOR THAT FACILITY. SO

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:00.611
THEREFORE SO WE'RE CONCERNED IN

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:03.414
OTHER WORDS THAT. TO THE EXTENT

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.516
THAT THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:07.618
THE STATE COULD BE. YOU KNOW

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:10.521
CLOSING HERE SEE BY THE TIME-

00:43:10.587 --> 00:43:13.290
THE WORK OR ALREADY BEFORE THE

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:15.592
REPAIRS ARE COMPLETED WHICH

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:16.160
WOULD OF COURSE NOT BE COST

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:18.362
EFFECTIVE. SO WE RECOMMEND

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:19.930
REJECTING THE PROPOSAL UNLESS

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:21.598
THE ADMINISTRATION CAN PROVIDE

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:24.134
HELLO AND A LONG TERM PLAN FOR

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:25.602
HOW LITTLE ADDRESS

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:27.204
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND- ANY

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:30.140
OTHER- CHALLENGES WITH

EITHER IN THE LONG TERM OR LONG

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:40.951
ENOUGH TO MAKE. THE REPAIR IS

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:44.188
WORTHWHILE ESSENTIALLY- TO THE

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:45.189
EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:47.324
DOES RICK REJECT THIS PROPOSAL

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:48.892
IT COULD RE REDIRECT THE

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:49.927
RESOURCES TO OTHER HIGH

00:43:49.994 --> 00:43:51.295
PRIORITY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:53.130
THAT PERSON THAT ARE NOT LIKELY

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:55.399
TO BE CLOSED. AND THEN ON

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:57.634
FINALLY ON THE BROADER ISSUE OF

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:59.103
THE STATE SIGNIFICANT PRISON

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:01.538

LEGISLATURE REQUIRE. THE

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:08.445
DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE A LONG

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.547
TERM STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:11.882
SIGNIFICANT PERSON PRISON

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:14.184
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS- THIS

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.519
INCLUDES PROVIDING A LIST OF

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:17.321
THE SIGNIFICANT HIGH PRIORITY

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:18.555
PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT THINKS

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.924
IT WILL NEED. AT THIS POINT TO

00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:22.226
COMPLETE OVER THE NEXT TEN

00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:23.994
YEARS- ACKNOWLEDGING THAT

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:25.996
THINGS OF COURSE MAY CHANGE IN

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:28.766
THE FUTURE- WE ALSO THINK THAT

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:29.833
THE REPORT SHOULD INCLUDE AN

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:30.868
EXPLANATION OF HOW THE

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:32.369
DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED VARIOUS

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:34.471
CRITERIA. IN SELECTING THESE

00:44:34.538 --> 00:44:37.007
PROJECTS- FOR EXAMPLE IT SHOULD

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:39.610
CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES TO. YOU

00:44:39.676 --> 00:44:40.711
KNOW NOT JUST REBUILD

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:42.146
FACILITIES AS THEY ARE NOW BUT

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.614
CONSIDER REDESIGNING THEM IN A

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.715
WAY THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THAT BUT

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:46.250
YOU KNOW OPERATIVE OPERATIONAL

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:49.086
SAVINGS WORK- IMPROVED.

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:51.055
SERVICES FOR INMATES OR PERHAPS

00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:53.057
CONSOLIDATING A WE'RE

00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:55.392
RELOCATING PRISONS- THE STATE

00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:56.160
SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:58.028
POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE PRISON

00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:01.131
CLOSURES AT IN TERMS OF HOW.

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:03.000
THINKING CARE HOW MUCH. IT

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:04.168
WANTS OR WHAT KIND OF TIME

00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:05.202
HORIZON IT WANTS TO MAKE

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:06.470
INVESTMENTS AND TO PRESENT

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.972
INFRASTRUCTURE- I JUST NOTE

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:11.642
THOUGH THAT THE FOR THE FACT

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:13.110
THAT THE PRISON IS. EXCUSE ME

00:45:13.177 --> 00:45:14.411
THE STATE IS PLANNING TO CLOSE

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:15.979
TO PRISON THAN WE THINK BASED

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:17.414
ON PROJECTIONS COULD BE IN A

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:18.148
POSITION TO CLOSE THREE

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:19.616
ADDITIONAL PRISONS. DOESN'T

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:22.052
ISN'T BUT THE PRIMARY DRIVER

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:24.288
BEHIND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

00:45:24.354 --> 00:45:25.522
THIS INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:28.158
REPORT BUT REALLY THE OVERALL-

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:29.426
SIGNIFICANT NEED AN

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:31.662
INFRASTRUCTURE IS WHAT DRIVES

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:32.796
THE FUNDAMENTAL NEED FOR A

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:34.598
PLAN. IN OTHER WORDS IF THE

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:35.933
STATE WERE CLOSING ZERO PRISONS

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:37.367
ARE FIVE PRESENTS IT STILL

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:39.436
NEEDS TO- ASSESS HOW IT'S GOING

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:43.307
TO ADDRESS. THIS MULTI BILLION

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:43.907
DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS.

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:47.945
THANK YOU AND HAVE TO TAKE.

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:50.114
THANK YOU- I WANT TO THANK-

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.782
MISTER BOARD FOR HIS COMMITMENT

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:53.450
TO GET US A PLAN AT THE

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.986
BEGINNING OF MARCH- HOPEFULLY

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:56.887
THIRTY TWO SAID SOME LIGHT AND

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:58.422
ANSWERS INTO SOME OF THE ALLEY

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:00.991
OF COMMENTS. OUT THERE MUCH

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:03.861
APPRECIATE THAT- I DID HAVE A

00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:04.928
QUESTION AS I LOOKED AT THE

00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:06.763
DATA AND THE POPULATION I'M

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.132
BEING THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN IN

00:46:08.198 --> 00:46:10.534
THE LAST THREE. DECADES AND

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:11.735
LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT WE

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:14.271
HAVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EMPTY

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:16.240
BEDS- AND AS WE'RE THINKING

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:18.575
ABOUT. THE POSSIBILITY OF

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:20.511
ADDITIONAL CLOSURES OR AS THE

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:21.979
L. A. O. SPEAKS ABOUT AN

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.380
ADDITIONAL THREE CLOSER TH ON

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.082
THE TWO THAT ARE PLANNED. OUT

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:26.850
WHAT'S A COMFORTABLE CUSHION

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:28.385
FOR EMPTY BEDS- FOR THE STATE

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:31.855
TO MAINTAIN. BEFORE ANOTHER

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:36.960
CLOSER CAN HAPPEN. MISTER MAYBE

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:43.901
CDC ARE. CONDUCTED A PRESS-

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:47.004
WELL I BEGINNING IN IN ANSWER-

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:47.971
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE THINGS THE

00:46:48.038 --> 00:46:48.939
DEPARTMENT IS DEALING WITH

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:51.241
RIGHT NOW IS THE AFFECTS OF

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.544
COVERT NINETEEN- ON OUR

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.779
POPULATION AND OUR OPERATIONS

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:58.815
AND- WITH THAT BERMAN HAS GONE

00:46:58.882 --> 00:47:00.684
TO ANY STANDARD OF PHYSICAL

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:02.619
DISTANCING AS IT RELATES TO OUR

00:47:02.686 --> 00:47:04.821
OPERATIONS AND OUR HOUSING

00:47:04.888 --> 00:47:05.389
DECISIONS WITHIN THE PRISON

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:07.624
SYSTEM. SO WE'RE CERTAINLY IN A

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:10.594
IN A POSITION WHERE WE NEED TO-

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.429
FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM GET GET

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:13.430
TO THE NEXT- GET GET AROUND THE

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:14.898
CORNER WELL WE HAVE TO BE ABLE

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:17.100
TO- LOOK FORWARD TO HAVE SO

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.036
MUCH OF THE STATE NEEDS TO-

00:47:19.102 --> 00:47:20.470
WITH A VACCINATION STRATEGIES

00:47:20.537 --> 00:47:22.573
ANOTHER STRATEGIES- SO THAT WE

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:25.576
CAN. GET BACK TO WHATOUR NEW

00:47:25.642 --> 00:47:26.910
NORMAL OPERATION IS GOING TO BE

00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:28.545
WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM I

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:29.713
THINK THAT THOSE THINGS NEED TO

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.615
OCCUR ALONG WITH THE CONTINUED

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:33.250
REVIEW OF POPULATION TRENDS

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.586
POPULATION PROJECTIONS IN ORDER

00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:37.988
TO GET TO A POINT WHERE- MORE

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:39.189
THAN THE TWO PERSONS THAT WE

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:41.525
HAVE COMMITTED TO CLOSING- CAN

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:44.094
CAN BE LOOKED AT. THAT'S KIND

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.629
OF IT IN A NUTSHELL I BELIEVE

00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:52.169
THE PARTNER FINANCE MIGHT HAVE.

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:53.737
SOMETHING THAT. LENITION I

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:56.607
DEPART OF IMPACTS. THANK YOU

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.642
ADAM I WOULD ADD THAT CURRENTLY

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.811
THERE IS ISOLATION SPACE THAT

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:02.679
SATISFIED DUE TO KOBE THE IRA

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:04.781
IN CASE ABOUT BREAKS AND THAT

00:48:04.848 --> 00:48:06.883
HAS REDUCED CAPACITY BY SEVERAL

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:09.686
THOUSAND BEDS. AND THERE'S ALSO

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:12.189
ROUTE WE'RE STILL EXPLORING THE

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:14.992
FUTURE USE OF DORM BETH OUT

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.027
WHICH IF THAT IS DISCONTINUED

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:21.164
COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR CAPACITY

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:23.166
BY SEVERAL THOUSAND MORE BAD.

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:25.602
IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:27.804
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT LOOKING AT

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.106
FUTURE PRISON CLOSURES BEYOND

00:48:29.172 --> 00:48:31.008
THAT TO THAT WE'VE ALREADY

00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:34.011
DISCUSSED. THE ADMINISTRATION

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.245
IS DEFINITELY COMMITTED TO

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:36.847
RIGHT SIZING THE PRESENT SYSTEM

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.849
AND THAT'S HOW STOP ALL MANNER

00:48:38.915 --> 00:48:40.017
AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT AYE

00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:42.586
AYE AYES AND TALKED ABOUT WE'VE

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:45.856
REDUCED OUR CONTRACTED PRISON

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:48.625
CAPACITY BESIDES. IT THE

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:50.694
ARTISTIC PADS WERE TERMINATED

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:53.263
IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:54.631
NINETEEN SIX OF THE SEVEN IN

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:55.666
THE STATE CONTRACTED BEDS HAVE

00:48:55.732 --> 00:48:58.835
BEEN. TERMINATED ON OCTOBER

00:48:58.902 --> 00:48:59.603
TWENTY TWENTY AND THE BUDGET

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.905
REFLECTS CLOSER OF THE FINAL

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:03.373
AND STATE CONTRACT THAT HAD

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.878
THE- VISIBILITY BY NAY OF

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:08.779
TWENTY ONE. FOR WE HAVE

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:10.480
COMMITTED AND TRAILER BILL

00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:12.916
LANGUAGE TO CLOSING TWO

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:15.285
PRESENTS- AS WE TALK ABOUT TV I

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:17.287
AM TWENTY ONE AND A SECOND

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:18.789
PERSON A TWENTY TWO TWENTY

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:21.291
THREE. AND WHEN WE IDENTIFY DVI

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:22.859
FOR CLOSER IT WAS THE HEAD OF

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:25.262
THE OUR STATUTORY NOTIFICATION

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:27.297
REQUIREMENT AND WE'RE ON TRACK

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:29.099
TO IDENTIFY THE SECOND PRESENT

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:31.601
BY THAT JANUARY TWENTY. TO THE

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.637
DEADLINE AS WELL THAT SAID WE

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:35.205
BELIEVE IT'S STILL PREMATURE TO

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:36.340
IDENTIFY THE TIMELINE FOR

00:49:36.406 --> 00:49:38.175
FUTURE PRISON CLOSURES BEYOND

00:49:38.241 --> 00:49:39.976
THAT YOU. IT'S A MAJOR DECISION

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:41.812
THAT HAS ENORMOUS IMPLICATIONS

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:43.280
FOR THE STAFF WHO WORK THERE

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:44.648
THE INMATES HOUSED THERE AND

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:46.016
THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:47.884
COMMUNITIES. AND SO IT'S A PATH

00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:52.923
WE DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN UNTIL.

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:53.490
RELATIVELY CERTAIN IT CAN BE

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:54.091
COMPLETED. AND THERE'S NO OF

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:55.025
FACTORS THAT REALLY PLANTED

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:56.993
ABOUT ONE OF THOSE IS THE

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.096
IMPACTS OF KOBE- LIKE I SAID

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:01.131
THERE'S- CURRENTLY ISOLATION

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:04.901
SPACE- AS OF THE DEPARTMENT.

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.470
AND WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:07.738
BRING THE VIRUS UNDER CONTROL

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:08.972
WITH OUR AGGRESSIVE TESTING

00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:10.707
PROTOCOLS IN THE DISTRIBUTION

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:12.642
OF VACCINES BUT THE OVERALL

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:14.478
TRAJECTORY WITHIN THE PRISON

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:16.480
SYSTEM STILL REMAINS UNCERTAIN.

00:50:16.546 --> 00:50:18.749
THE SAFETY OF INMATES AND STAFF

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:21.585
ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE AND

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:23.286
WE WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:25.355
PREMATURELY CONSOLIDATING ANY

00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:27.257
INSTITUTIONS. COURTS ARE

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:28.792
WATCHING AND LOOKING OUT HOW

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.227
THESE ISSUES WILL BE HANDLED

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:32.295
LONG TERM AND WE NEED TO BE

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:33.897
MINDFUL OF THESE COMPLICATED

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:35.365
LEGAL IMPLICATIONS AS WE

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:37.734
CONSIDER FUTURE POTENTIAL

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.369
PRISON CLOSURES. IN ADDITION

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:40.704
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:41.838
THAT MAKING RELATIVELY

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:43.240
PERMANENT DECISIONS LIKE

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.542
CLOSING PRISONS BASED ON LONG

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:48.211
TERM PROJECTIONS IS RISKY. CDCR

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:49.479
GOOD AT OUR POPULATION

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:50.647
PROJECTIONS AND ARE FAIRLY

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.582
ACCURATE WITHIN A YEAR TO YOU

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:53.750
USUALLY WITHIN A COUPLE OF

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:55.018
PERCENTAGE POINTS WHICH IS

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:57.120
USUALLY LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.755
INMATES MARGIN OF ERROR.

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:00.624
HOWEVER THE FURTHER OUT YOU GO

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.325
THERE IS A HIGHER MARGIN OF

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:05.796
ERROR AND IT CAN BE 10215% OR

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:07.097
FIFTEEN THOUSAND INMATES. AND

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.432
THAT'S NOT AN INDICTMENT OF THE

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:09.599
PRODUCTIONS BUT RATHER

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:11.468
REFLECTION OF HOW THE POLICY

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:12.702
CHANGES HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:14.438
YEARS AND ILLUSTRATES WHY

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:16.440
MAKING LONG TERM INFRASTRUCTURE

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:18.809
DECISIONS. BASED ONLY ON MULTI

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:21.545
YEAR PROJECTIONS IS RISKY. SO

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:22.712
FOR THOSE REASONS WE BELIEVE IT

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:24.448
SO PREMATURE TO AND IDENTIFY

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:27.984
ADDITIONAL PRISON CONVERTERS

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:29.119
BEYOND THIS YEAR. AT YOU FOR

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:32.022
THAT I- TO SEE CLEAR. WE I WAS

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:34.391
NOT ASKING TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:36.226
CLOSER EARTH ANYTHING THIS IS

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:37.627
IN LINE WITH A THEY'RE ASKING

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:39.496
FOR A TEN YEAR LONG TERM PLAN.

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:41.198
THAT WILL HAVE MANY VARIABLES

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:42.566
IS ONE OF THE MANY VARIABLES

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:44.668
THAT WE THINK WOULD BE INCLUDED

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:46.436
IN THAT DISCUSSION AND THOSE

00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:49.639
DECISIONS- AND SUCH AS WANT TO

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:51.308
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING

00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:52.509
SMART WHILE WE WANT TO MAKE

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:53.443
SURE THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.978
MERGER AND ERROR OF. THE SIZE

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.781
OF THE POPULATION. AND I WANT

00:51:57.848 --> 00:51:58.348
TO BE REALISTIC THAT BECAUSE

00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:58.982
IT'S GOING TO BE WITH US FOR A

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.851
WHILE IT'S NOT GOING AWAY.

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:02.853
RIGHT AWAY I ALSO WANT TO BE

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.554
MINDFUL OF THE ERROR OF NOT

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.323
PLANNING ACCORDINGLY AND THEN

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:07.691
HAVING TO RESPOND TO OUR VOTERS

00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:09.226
OF TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:11.361
WASTED. ALONG THE WAY AS WE'VE

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:12.863
SEEN WITH THIS CLOSER IN OUR

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:15.966
WE'VE INVESTED. RECENTLY CLOSE

00:52:16.032 --> 00:52:17.200
TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A

00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:19.002
PERSON WAY ABOUT THE GROWTH.

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:21.838
OUT THERE SO- DOES I THINK AT

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:23.340
THIS POINT TO KEEPING THAT

00:52:23.406 --> 00:52:24.040
GOING TO GIVE ME A DIRECT

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:26.142
ANSWER BUT- COME. EARLY

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:27.777
MARCHING IN TO GIVE US A REPORT

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:29.012
I HOPE THIS IS PART OF IT'S

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:30.280
GOING TO BE CONSIDERED IN YOUR

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:32.215
DEFENSE ANALYSIS OUT THERE. NOT

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:33.683
WITH THAT I'M GOING TO PASS IT

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:37.654
OVER TO MR LACKEY. WHO I KNOW

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:38.255
HAD SOME QUESTIONS. YEAH JUST

00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:17.727
COSTLY. AND I JUST WONDERED IF

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:20.297
THAT WAS. ONE OF THE STRONG

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:21.531

WITH INVESTMENTS HAVE ALREADY

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:44.654
OCCURRED- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:45.488

OF THE FACILITIES TO CONDITIONS

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:17.681
AND WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO

RECEIVED. ANY ANALYSIS FROM CDC

00:55:29.759 --> 00:55:33.229
ARE. EITHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:35.965
DON'T WANT TO. EITHER'S BECAUSE

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:38.034
THEY'RE INCOMPETENT WHY JUST

00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:39.869
BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.771
DISAGREEMENT COLONEL PROBLEM

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.973
WITH THIS THIS IDEA OF

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.209
PROVIDING THE BEST FACILITIES

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:47.377
FOR NOT ONLY TO PRISON GUARD TO

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:49.212
THEIR BUT THE INMATES THAT ARE

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:51.448
THERE. I WOULD SUGGEST MADAM

ESTATE COMPANY COULD GO INTO

00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:00.924
CDC OUR LOOK AT OUR FACILITIES

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.393
AND MAP OUT A PLAN. OF HOW

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.961
TRIED TO REHAB THE EXISTING

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:07.063
FACILITIES SO THEY MEET THE

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:09.265
STANDARDS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT

00:56:09.332 --> 00:56:12.168
EVERYBODY IN THE SYSTEM SHOULD

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:14.137
HAVE. BUT MOST IMPORTANT.

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:16.740
DISCOVER WHICH FACILITIES HAVE

00:56:16.806 --> 00:56:18.742
COME TO THE END OF THEIR USEFUL

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:22.312
LIFE. AND MOST IMPORTANT THAT

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:26.349
WE DON'T INVEST IN FACILITIES.

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:28.918
THAT WE MAY ULTIMATELY TEAR

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:31.121
DOWN SELL OR ABANDON. I

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:33.189
REMEMBER A MILLION DOLLAR

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.958
KITCHEN THAT WOULD PEOPLE

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:36.426
WANTED TO BUILD IN A IN A

WHICH THIS COMMITTEE SAID NO TO.

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:46.436
SALT I THINK AT THIS POINT WE

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:49.205
SHOULD STOP WAITING. STOP

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:51.407
ALLOWING CDC ARE TO DRAG THEIR

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:53.910

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:00.917
OF FACILITY THAT THEY NEED TO

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:03.052
DO THEIR WORK. AND IF WE HAVE

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:05.321
TO TAKE OR FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:07.390
FIND AT FUNDING SO WE CAN DO IT

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:10.026
OURSELVES WE SHOULD BECAUSE

00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:11.995
ULTIMATELY IN THE LONG RUN. WE

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:13.563
WILL SAVE TAXPAYERS BILLIONS OF

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:17.133
DOLLARS. WE MAY ACTUALLY SAVE

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.202
SOME LIVES IN BUILDINGS THAT

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:22.105

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:22.639

OPERATING ALTHOUGH AT A MUCH

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:29.158
REDUCED CAPACITY BUT LICENSING

REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE PLANS DO

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:32.362
REQUIRE I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE

DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT TO

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:47.783
SHARE AT THIS TIME I BELIEVE

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.517
THE ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE'RE

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.219
GOING TO NEED TO DO TO START

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:52.588
WITH IS TO MEET WITH A VERY

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.023
STAKEHOLDERS. WITHIN THE

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.792
DEPARTMENT- THAT THE DIVISION

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:59.028
OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS OBVIOUSLY

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:01.297
OUR HEALTHCARE PARTNERS INDIA

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:03.733
P. BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS COMES

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:04.967
DOWN TO THE DIFFERENT

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.535
SUBPOPULATIONS IN THE DIFFERENT

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:07.470
MISSIONS OF THE DIFFERENT

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:09.171
PERSONS- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.306
THAT IF WE WERE TO PROPOSED

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.041
CONSOLIDATION OF ANY. THAT THEY

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.643
HAVE SIMILAR MISSIONS AND

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:15.845
SIMILAR POPULATIONS THAT ARE

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.947
SERVED BY THOSE LOCATIONS- SO

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.682
THERE'S A LOT OF ANALYSIS THAT

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.917
WILL BE REQUIRED FOR US TO TALK

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:23.653
ABOUT THOSE PER HALF

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:24.920
PROJECTIONS OF HOW THAT MIGHT

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.722

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:29.125
OVERLAY THAT WITH- THE PRISONS

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:30.860
THAT ARE EAGER GOOD CANDIDATES

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:32.728
FOR REMAIN OPEN GOOD CANDIDATES

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:35.498
POTENTIALLY FOR CLOSURE AND HOW

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:36.732
TO COORDINATE THE- SO I'M THE

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.601
FIRST ONE I DON'T HAVE. THIS IS

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.069
A PROCESS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:42.338
BE EMBARKING UPON- AND I DON'T

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:43.706

HOW YOU CHOSE DVR. BUT IT COMES

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:56.886
DOWN TO THE- TRANSACTION TWO

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.318
MOVED- DVR YOU TOWARDS THE

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.587
CLOSURE DECISION- SOME OF THEM

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.089
ARE PHYSICAL PLANT ITEMS WHICH

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:34.957
IS ONE OF THE SIX CRITERIA. THE

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:36.559
LOCATION IS PRONE TO FLOODING

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:38.594
I'M PLAYING ACCORDING A ARE A

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.863
CATASTROPHIC FLOOD I BELIEVE IN

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.398
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX- THAT. CUT

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:44.266
OFF THE INSTITUTION FOR A

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.067
COUPLE OF DAYS FROM THE OUTSIDE

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:47.903
ROADS- WE HAVE CHRONIC ISSUES.

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:49.638
WITH POTABLE WATER AND

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.741
WASTEWATER DISCHARGE. DENIED

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:53.609
DUE TO ITS LOCATION I'M IN THE

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.010
SAN JOAQUIN SACRAMENTO RIVER

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:57.146
DELTA AREA. I'LL BE ON THE

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:58.748
FACILITY ISSUES THERE WERE

01:06:58.814 --> 01:07:00.549
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. I GOT

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:03.152
SOME MISTER BORK JUST JUST OUT

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:05.254
OF CURIOSITY WHY WHY DID THIS

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:06.655
FACILITY STAND OUT OVER THE

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:13.195
OTHER. THIRTY SOME FACILITIES

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:13.796
IN THE SYSTEM. I DID DID YOU

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:14.630
DID YOU TAKE EACH THOSE. SIX

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.899
CAL AND PENAL CODE US THEM.

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:20.403
POINTS OR PERCENTAGES AND THEN

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:20.936
RANK THAT CAME OUT RANKED

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:27.076
NUMBER ONE. IT WAS NOT THE

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:28.477
NATURE OF THESE DIFFERENT

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:31.080
FACTORS IN THE NATURE OF OUR

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:31.647
THIRTY FOUR STATE OWNED AND

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.282
OPERATED INSTITUTIONS DIDN'T

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.584
ALLOW ITSELF TO ANY SORT OF MAP

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:37.019
EQUATION IN ORDER TO REACH THAT

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.388
CONCLUSION. SO THERE BUT THEN

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:40.890
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MEAN

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:41.490
COMPLETELY ARBITRARY DECISION

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:46.729
THAT. ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.097
MEMBER THING I WOULD NOT REFER

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:50.766
TO DECISION F. AS ARBITRARY.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:51.767
YOU HAVEN'T PROVIDED ANY

CONSIDERED WE ALSO WANTED TO

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:07.917
NOTE THAT THE IMPACT TO WORK

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:09.652
FORCE WAS LESSENED BY CHOOSING

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:12.855
THAT FACILITY. AND IT HAS A MIX

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.824
OF POPULATION MINIMUM AND

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:17.393
MAXIMUM THAT MADE SENSE FOR

FITS. BUT YOU'RE NOT WALKING ME

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:36.512
THROUGH THE METHODOLOGY OF HOW

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:38.948
YOU ARRIVED AT THE DECISION.

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:41.116
THE DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM A

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.952
VARIETY OF SOURCES WITHIN THE

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:45.054
DEPARTMENT- THAT WERE REACHED

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.623
THAT. APPROXIMATED THE SIX

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:49.191
CLOSER FACTORS THAT WERE LISTED

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:51.594
IN THE PENAL CODE SECTION OF

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.230
DATA THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH US.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.065
I WOULD HAVE IS KNOCKED OUT OF

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.066
IT I WOULD THAT WAS GIVEN BY

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:59.201
ALL I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SEEK

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:01.537
PERMISSION TO SEE HOW THAT DATA

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.239
CAN BE SURE. I WAS JUST ONE

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.573
PART OF PROVIDING DOWN ON

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.509
FACILITY SITE. WERE IS DOWN IT

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:09.812
WASN'T PROVIDED ON STAMPING ON.

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:12.248
I'M SORRY YOUR METHODOLOGY IS

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:16.452
NOT VERY CLEAR I'M HAVING VERY.

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:17.086
THOUGHT HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME

01:09:17.152 --> 01:09:21.190
FOLLOWING YOUR METHODOLOGY. AND

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:22.358
THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT IS IF

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:24.193
WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.296
YOU KNOW BETWEEN THREE TO FOUR

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.298
TO FIVE MORE FACILITIES TO-

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:30.699
POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATE WHICH WE

01:09:30.766 --> 01:09:32.668
THINK IS A GOOD STEP WE DO YOU

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:37.373
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE. ON A-

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:40.042
SET OF CRITERIA THAT YOU WOULD

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:40.676
YOU SAY IT'S IN THE CODE WHICH

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:43.145
WE APPRECIATE- BUT THAT THERE

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:46.582
IS A WAY THAT- ALL OF US HERE

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:49.852
COULD FOLLOW. FOLLOW THAT

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.854
CRITERIA AND THERE'S A CERTAIN

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:54.590
METHODOLOGY- AT THIS POINT WHAT

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:57.893
YOU'VE DESCRIBED IS COMPLETELY

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.664
ARBITRARY AND VERY CONFUSING.

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:02.598
SO I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:04.333
COMPLETELY ARBITRARY I HAVE NO

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.834
OTHER CHOICE BUT TO USE THAT

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:07.870
WORD BECAUSE YOU'VE GIVEN ME.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:13.242
NO EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY.

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:14.743
TAKING I'M TAKING A LACK OF

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.880
RESPONSE BY- SILENT KNOWLEDGE

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:23.352

THAT GATHER DATA WELL I

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.425
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT ANSWER IS

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.226
NOT SATISFACTORY TO YOU BUT

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.628
THAT THAT DIDN'T THAT WAS THE

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:33.662
DEAL AND I DON'T KNOW WAS DONE

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:35.531
BY TICKET GATHERING DATA IN A

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:36.865
COMPARISON OF THAT DOWN UP

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:38.601
ACROSS THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:41.003
OF. THE DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.405
REACH A DECISION BY

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:44.573
DEPARTMENTAL LEADERSHIP IN

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.375
CONSULTATION WITH THE DOCTOR

KNOW AGAIN USE YOUR. SAME

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:54.216
METHODOLOGY TO PICK FOR

FACILITIES. ROCKETS THE SAME TO

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:56.452
YOU HOW DID YOU ARRIVE HOW DID

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:58.187
WE ARRIVE ON TO SAY WILL REDUCE

01:10:58.253 --> 01:10:59.855
THE SIX CRITERIA WE JUST CHOSE

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:03.192
FOUR FACILITIES WE THINK.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:03.726

WAY FOR A LIST OF CLOSER TO

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:19.274
BEING TO BE A PUT TOGETHER OKAY

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:20.609

QUESTION YEAH WHAT WOULD BE

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:43.699
HELPFUL TO KNOW WHO YOU'RE-

AND LIKELY WILL GET MORE

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:48.310
EXPENSIVE IF NOT ADDRESSED-

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:51.179

IT. AND BASED ON PROJECTIONS

ADDITIONAL PRISONS- WE'RE

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:07.095
CONCERNED THAT THESE PROJECTS

01:21:07.162 --> 01:21:09.531
IF. UNDERTAKEN AT ONE OF THOSE

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:13.134
PRISONS MIGHT. BE COMPLETED

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:14.135
AROUND THE TIME THAT THE PRISON

IS BEING CLOSE GIVEN THAT THESE

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:17.939
PROJECTS CAN TAKE A COUPLE

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:19.741
YEARS TO COMPLETE. SO WE

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:21.509
RECOMMEND. RESTRICTING THE

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:33.755
CANNOT BE SPENT AT PRISONS THAT

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:35.624
ARE LIKELY CANDIDATES ARE

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:38.727
STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE.

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:42.163
AND ADD TO- HELP AFFECTION WITH

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.665
THAT RECOMMENDATION WE THINK

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:44.766
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:47.469

OF THESE ITEMS ON AND TO THINK

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:32.280
AGAIN AT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:33.481
THAT WE REALLY NEED THAT PLAN

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:34.649
IN ORDER TO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:37.085

THERE- I DO TWO FIVE ONE

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:44.426
QUESTION ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN.

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:45.760
THAT WAS OMITTED AND THAT TOO

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:48.096
BIRTH- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:49.998
VERSUS TWENTY TWENTY IT WAS THE

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:51.433
EVENTUALLY AT EIGHT BILLION

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:54.703
DOLLARS AND A COUPLE YEARS. IT

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:56.838
ROASTED THIRTEEN BILLION

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.840
DOLLARS OVER LOOKING AT A 60%

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.442
INCREASE IN WHAT WAS ESTIMATED.

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.444
THIS IS JUST WONDERING WHAT'S

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:04.979
HAPPENED IN A COUPLE YEARS THAT

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.082
CREATED SUCH A DRASTIC INCREASE

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:10.618
TO. THE OVERALL MASTER PLAN FOR

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:15.423

AND I GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:24.199
WITH AN ANSWER- WE CAN SEE THAT

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.134
IN THE AGENDA BUT DID NOT HAVE

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.902

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:52.894
AND VARIANCE AND JUST A COUPLE

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:55.864
YEARS- OF YOU KNOW IN THIS CASE

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:58.600
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS I WOULD TO

01:23:58.666 --> 01:23:59.167
MY DISTRICT WOULD GO REALLY

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:01.770
LONG WAY- IT MAKES US QUESTION-

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:03.004

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:09.177
SIZE WERE MOVING FORWARD AND

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:10.412
WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE PLANS-

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:12.147
THAT. MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:14.983
METHODOLOGY IS IMPORTANT THIS

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:15.583

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:24.025
pAND BACK UP- ARCHER SILVA

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:26.327
RETAINS- REQUEST FOR

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:28.363
METHODOLOGY AND CRITERIA AND

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:29.230
THE REASON WHY THAT SO

01:24:29.297 --> 01:24:31.299
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE HAVE

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:33.468
EIGHTY FACILITIES HERE. A

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:35.503
SLATED FOR IMPROVEMENTS THAT.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:37.372
RACK UP A BILL OF FIFTY MILLION

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:42.477
DOLLARS AND WE JUST SPENT FORTY

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:43.812
THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN A

01:24:43.878 --> 01:24:44.446
PRISON THAT WE'RE GOING TO SHUT

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:48.950
DOWN. I DON'T WE'RE LIKELY TO

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:53.087
REPEAT A SIMILAR- MISTAKE IF WE

01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:55.957
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:57.659
THAT YOU'RE UTILIZING TO MAKE

01:24:57.725 --> 01:25:05.066
THIS. TO READ IN THE CRITERIA

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:06.935
WE SHOULD PROBABLY HOLD OFF ON

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:09.771
THOSE REPAIRS AND SO I THINK

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:10.872
THE COMMUNICATION IS TO BE

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.874
STRONGER FOR THOSE OF US WHO

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:13.775
ARE SHARING IN THIS

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.176
RESPONSIBILITY OF MAKING THESE

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:17.412
DETERMINATIONS THAT SO WE'RE

01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:19.447
NOT NECESSARILY TRYING TO BACK

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:20.548

ALL BENEFIT FROM THIS. KIND OF

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:33.161
COMMUNICATION. MISTER THINK.

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:34.696
WOULD SUGGEST A PIGGY BACK ON

BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:39.267

ANSWER THAT QUESTION AS OF AT

01:26:01.589 --> 01:26:03.658

BE THAT ANY OF THE FACILITIES

POSITION TO ANSWER THAT

01:26:24.779 --> 01:26:26.314
QUESTION RIGHT NOW SO WE HEAR

01:26:26.381 --> 01:26:28.683
THAT AND- WE WILL WE UNDERSTAND

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.051
THE COMMITTEES AND FIRST IN THE

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.953
SEPARATION AND THE FACT THAT

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.289
THERE'S TREMENDOUS FRUSTRATION

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.190
THAT THIS INFORMATION HAS NOT

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:37.325
BEEN PROVIDED UP TO THIS POINT

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:39.294
IN TIME. WITH THE GUYS THAT WE

ANYTHING ON THIS LIST WOULD NOT

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:44.165
BE POTENTIALLY SLATED FOR

WE COULD AT LEAST SAY. WITHIN

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:55.810
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WE HAVE A

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.512
SENSE OF WHAT WHAT COULD BE

01:26:57.579 --> 01:26:59.213
SLATED FOR CLOSURE WE JUST

DON'T NEED TO PUT A NEW ROOF ON

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:19.634
THE FACILITY GONNA. CLOSE IN

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:20.134
FIVE YEARS JUST JUST FOR

PROVIDING HEALTHIER MEALS FOR

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:16.009
THE INMATES IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:17.077
THE DEPARTMENT THOUGHT THAT

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:19.746
THEY COULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:21.248
TO PROVIDE THOSE ME ALSO THEY

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:23.517
DID FIND SAVINGS TO MAKE SURE

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:26.820
THEY COULD IMPLEMENT IT HOWEVER

01:45:26.887 --> 01:45:27.287
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:32.592
AVAILABLE. THANK YOUNG. THANK

01:45:32.659 --> 01:45:34.361

IS FROM IS IRWIN ON THE

01:45:35.696 --> 01:45:37.731
CONTRABAND THEN LOOKING AT THE

01:45:37.798 --> 01:45:39.366

TWENTY TWENTY AND KNOW THAT WE

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:53.413
STOP THEM VISITATIONS FROM MOST

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.215
OF THE YEAR WITHOUT THINKING

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:56.917
CAP INMATES FROM THE COUNTY

01:45:56.983 --> 01:45:58.852

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:00.487
SEEING FROM HIGH LEVELS OF

01:46:00.554 --> 01:46:03.990
CONTRABAND. AND WE'RE SEEING

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:04.658
SOME INCREASES WITH SOME OF THE

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:08.361
CONTRABAND HERE. ON THIS TABLE.

01:46:08.428 --> 01:46:09.696
IF YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT AS TO

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:15.302
WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. I AM A-

01:46:15.368 --> 01:46:17.137
I AM WITH THE TECHNOLOGY A

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:18.972

SEIZE VISITING WE CITIES HAVING

VOLUNTEERS VISITORS COMING INTO

01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:51.404
OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND WE STILL

01:46:51.471 --> 01:46:54.875
HAD- AN INFLUX OF CONTRABAND-

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:58.745
COMING INTO OUR INSTITUTIONS-

KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WE DO

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:03.416
RECOGNIZE THAT WE STILL DO

01:47:03.483 --> 01:47:06.319
HAVE- CONTRACTORS COMING IN OUR

01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:07.788
INSTITUTIONS THAT WE ALL DO WE

01:47:07.854 --> 01:47:10.924
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT- IT'S- IT'S

COMING AND YOU STAFF WELL. AND

01:47:13.627 --> 01:47:15.328
WE ARE WORKING YES SERIOUSLY

01:47:15.395 --> 01:47:17.497
AND WE DO HAVE A HOST OF

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:22.769
DIFFERENT- CONTRABAND- TOOLS

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:26.039
THAT WE USE TO- TRY TO FIND ALL

01:47:26.106 --> 01:47:27.808
THE CONTRABAND THE DISCOVERY

01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:30.076
AND REMOVE IT PRIOR TO COMING

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:31.978
INTO THE INSTITUTION AS WELL AS

01:47:32.045 --> 01:47:35.015
TOOLS THAT WE USE- DETECT AND

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:37.184
FIND CONTRABAND WITHIN OUR

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:42.556
INSTITUTIONS. LET ME SEE IF I

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:44.991
DON'T OF FINANCE. AT I'D LIKE

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:46.193
TO ADD THAT THERE ARE OTHER

01:47:46.259 --> 01:47:48.562
WAYS THAT CONTRABAND ALSO MAKES

01:47:48.628 --> 01:47:51.431
ITS WAY WITHIN THE INSTITUTION-

01:47:51.498 --> 01:47:53.266
THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:54.901
CALLED THAT DROPS WHERE SOMEONE

01:47:54.968 --> 01:47:57.404
WILL THROW CONTRABAND OVER THE

01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:59.206
FENCE SO INMATES CAN FIND IT.

01:47:59.272 --> 01:48:00.574
CONTRABAND ALSO CAN COME IN

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.175
THROUGH THE MAIL ROOM SO CDCR

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:04.010
IS STILL ACTIVELY WORKING TO

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:05.745
LOCATE AS MUCH CONTRABAND AS

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:07.147
POSSIBLE SO THERE ARE OTHER

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:10.851
AVENUES OTHER THAN VISITING FOR

01:48:10.917 --> 01:48:11.418
THE CONTRAVENTION MAY COULD

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:14.721
STAND SIDE. AND SO I GUESS THE

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:15.422
QUESTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:17.991
AVENUES FOR THE CONTRABAND BUT

01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:18.592
THE STRATEGY IS THAT WERE YOU

01:48:18.658 --> 01:48:20.894
SEEN AND- ARE THERE WAYS THAT

01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:23.563
WE COULD. YOU STRATEGIES BETTER

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:27.567
OR- ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES WE

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:28.335
COULD BE SEEING I MEAN IT'S

01:48:28.401 --> 01:48:30.804
STILL ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:32.172
CELLPHONES IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:33.773
STILL A REALLY LARGE NUMBER OF

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.208
EITHER THROUGH THE MAIL OR

01:48:35.275 --> 01:48:37.244
BEING THROWN OVER THE FENCE.

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:41.715
AMOUNTS UHHUH OF CONTRABAND

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:43.383
WE'RE LOOKING AT TOBACCO YOU

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:46.720
KNOW. A FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:48:46.786 --> 01:48:49.122
POUNDS THIS IS WITH THE SAKE I

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:50.257
REALLY THAT THERE'S MORE THAN

01:48:50.323 --> 01:48:52.259
THAT BUT IT JUST SEEMS THAT

01:48:52.325 --> 01:48:53.560
MAYBE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT

01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:56.196
OUR STRATEGIES FOR THIS

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:57.564
CONTRABAND WHERE INVESTING

01:48:57.631 --> 01:48:58.999
MONIES I MEAN I DON'T WANT TO

01:48:59.065 --> 01:48:59.532
LAUGH ABOUT THIS WE ARE

01:48:59.599 --> 01:49:01.568
INVESTING MONIES- AND DIFFERENT

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:03.703
STRATEGIES ARE TRYING TO DO

01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:05.538
INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:07.607
DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAMS-

01:49:07.674 --> 01:49:08.642
AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WERE

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:10.143
MAYBE GETTING OUR MONEY'S WORTH

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:11.945
OUT THERE AND SO. I DON'T WANT

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:13.747
TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT PEOPLE

01:49:13.813 --> 01:49:15.782
BRING THINGS OVER THE FENCE BUT

01:49:15.849 --> 01:49:16.683
I THINK IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME

01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:18.618
POINT WE'VE BEEN- POUNDING ON

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:19.686
FROM THE BEGINNING HAVE YOU

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:21.388
SEEN OUR DAUGHTERS OUR DOLLARS

01:49:21.454 --> 01:49:24.457
WISELY OUT THERE AND SO. DO WE

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:25.091
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF HOW TO

01:49:25.158 --> 01:49:29.462
BETTER USE OUR STRATEGIES ON

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:32.165
THIS CONTRABAND. SO WE HAVE A

01:49:32.232 --> 01:49:33.934
REFLECTANCE. WITH HER WOULD WE

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.603
HAVE A LARGE- OF THAT COMING IN

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:38.772
THROUGH MAIL ROOM- THREE

01:49:38.838 --> 01:49:42.509
PACKAGES- AND ALSO- DROPS

01:49:42.575 --> 01:49:44.277
AROUND THE INSTITUTIONS.

01:49:44.344 --> 01:49:47.080
HOWEVER RECENTLY AND I'M- ONE

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:48.882

AND INFORMATION- WILL PROBABLY

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.008
BE MAKING SOME PROPOSALS ON

01:50:15.075 --> 01:50:16.543
SOME. SOME ADDITIONAL-

01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:18.244
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ON ONCE

01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:19.312
THEY DETERMINE THAT THEY

01:50:19.379 --> 01:50:21.715
RECOGNIZED AS BEING. BOTH THE

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:24.184

UNWANTED DATA POINT BUT AN

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:46.573
IMPORTANT THAT A POINT THAT

01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:47.440
IT'S MORE THAN THAT AND SO I DO

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:49.275
LOOK FORWARD TO THE PROPOSAL

02:00:35.595 --> 02:00:36.395
THOUSAND HOUSE GOING TO SAY IF

02:00:36.462 --> 02:00:37.997

EIGHTEEN MAYBE TWENTY THOUSAND

02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:41.267
YOU GOT 50% OF THEM I WOULD

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:42.802
URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO GIVE

EVEN MORE MONEY TO GET RID OF

02:00:44.971 --> 02:00:47.573
THE OTHER ELEVEN THOUSAND. BUT

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:51.010
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS OPERATION

02:00:51.077 --> 02:00:53.579
MAY NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS WE

02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:56.983
WITH THAT ARM ESPECIALLY WHEN

02:00:57.049 --> 02:01:00.453
YOU LOOK AT- THE PEOPLE IN

02:01:00.519 --> 02:01:04.457
TWENTY TWENTY. ARE ABLE TO

02:01:04.523 --> 02:01:07.593

GIVE MORE MONEY TO IT BUT IT I

02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:18.671
DON'T KNOW HOW IT EFFECTIVE

02:01:18.738 --> 02:01:20.840
THIS STRATEGY IS WHICH MAKES IT

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.875
VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.910
RECOMMEND THAT WE MOVE FORWARD

02:01:24.977 --> 02:01:26.445
WITH DOING MORE THAT UNLESS WE

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:28.848
HAVE AN AUDIT THAT SHOWS. THAT

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:30.316
IN CERTAIN PRISONS THERE WAS

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:32.151
EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AND SO WHAT

02:01:32.218 --> 02:01:33.919
YOU'RE YOU'RE HEARING NOW IS

02:01:33.986 --> 02:01:37.623
EVEN IF WE DO THIS WE HAVE TO

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:39.025
DO ADDITIONAL THINGS. BIKE

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:42.728

UNDER BRED TRUCKS ESPECIALLY

02:01:55.908 --> 02:01:57.476
WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY

02:01:57.543 --> 02:01:59.278

02:02:06.385 --> 02:02:09.121
TOGETHER AND REALLY LOOK

02:02:09.188 --> 02:02:11.257
CLOSELY. IN AMERICA. AND LOOK

02:02:11.323 --> 02:02:14.727
AT WAYS THAT YOU CAN STOP. ALL

02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:15.861
OF THIS CONTRABAND FROM COMING

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:19.298
IN. AND CREATE SYSTEMS NOT ONLY

02:02:19.365 --> 02:02:22.601
WORKED WITH CAMERAS ON EVERY

02:02:22.668 --> 02:02:23.869
PRISON GUARD AT A BILL THEN.

02:02:23.936 --> 02:02:27.273
BUT YOU ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

02:02:27.339 --> 02:02:31.377
YOU YOU. SEND EACH ONE TO SOME

02:02:31.444 --> 02:02:33.512
KIND OF SCREENING PROCESS I

02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:35.748
KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IT WOULD

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:39.552
BE ADDITIONAL COSTS IN LABOR.

02:02:39.618 --> 02:02:41.721
BUT IF YOU DID THE MATH OF THE

02:02:41.787 --> 02:02:45.658
NUMBER OF GUARDS EACH DAY TIMES.

02:02:45.725 --> 02:02:47.359
THREE AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS AND

02:02:47.426 --> 02:02:50.029
HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES. I'M NOT

02:02:50.096 --> 02:02:51.764
SURE YOU WOULD GET TO A BILLION

02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:56.769
DOLLARS. IN N. AND COST OVER

02:02:56.836 --> 02:02:59.972
TIME OR IN THIS CASE BILLIONS

02:03:00.039 --> 02:03:02.308
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO STOP

02:03:02.374 --> 02:03:04.343
THE CONTRABAND THE DEATHS THE

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:07.580
SUICIDES THE OVERDOSES THAT ARE

02:03:07.646 --> 02:03:10.049
RESULT OF ALL OF IT. AND SO IF

02:03:10.116 --> 02:03:11.817
WE WERE TO ACOSTA NOW TO DO THE

02:03:11.884 --> 02:03:13.152
BUDGET COMMITTEE IF WE WERE

02:03:13.219 --> 02:03:16.822
JUST DO A COST ANALYSIS OF IT.

02:03:16.889 --> 02:03:18.691
AND YOU WERE TO BRING IT TO US

02:03:18.758 --> 02:03:21.227
WAYS YOU COULD YOU PLEASE STOP

02:03:21.293 --> 02:03:23.095
CONTRABAND IF YOU BROUGHT A

02:03:23.162 --> 02:03:29.168
COMPREHENSIVE- PROPOSAL TO US.

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:30.169
I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:31.971
COMMITTEE WHERE NOT ONLY

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:36.008
EMBRACE IT- BUT WE WOULD MOVE

02:03:36.075 --> 02:03:36.408
FORWARD WITH SOME

02:03:36.475 --> 02:03:38.177
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. AND

02:03:38.244 --> 02:03:40.079
AGAIN I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S

02:03:40.146 --> 02:03:40.946
BEEN ANY ACCOUNTABILITY

02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:42.982
MEASURES ON THIS M. A. S.

02:03:43.048 --> 02:03:47.520
SYSTEM- AND SEE HOW EFFECTIVE

02:03:47.586 --> 02:03:49.555
IT IS AND- ROOTING OUT CONTRA.

02:03:49.622 --> 02:03:51.457
AND SO- BUT I. YOU KNOW I WAS

02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:53.526
CORRECTED I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:54.693
EIGHTEEN INSTITUTIONS HOURS

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:55.761
CORRECTED THAT THAT NUMBER WAS

02:03:55.828 --> 02:03:57.897
OVER. ALL OF THE INSTITUTION

02:03:57.963 --> 02:04:00.099
MEANS ALL OF THE INMATES AND SO

02:04:00.166 --> 02:04:02.034
OXIDES IS STILL I DON'T KNOW IF

02:04:02.101 --> 02:04:03.936
THAT'S OUT OF. YOU KNOW IF YOU

02:04:04.003 --> 02:04:06.238
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S TWENTY TWO

02:04:06.305 --> 02:04:09.675
THOUSAND- CELL PHONES THERE

02:04:09.742 --> 02:04:11.644
LEGALLY CONTRABAND IN PRISONS.

02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:13.712
WELL YEAH ELEVEN THOUSAND IS A

02:04:13.779 --> 02:04:16.348
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE NUMBER BUT AS

02:04:16.415 --> 02:04:18.584
THE CLOSER TO FIFTY OR SIXTY

02:04:18.651 --> 02:04:19.185
THOUSAND THEN YEAH WE'VE WE'VE

02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:22.021
GOT A- REDO OUR NUMBERS AND SO

02:04:22.087 --> 02:04:23.689
IF YOU COULD. I DON'T KNOW IF

02:04:23.756 --> 02:04:24.857
YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT OR IF YOU

02:04:24.924 --> 02:04:26.759
CAN COME BACK TO US WITH A MORE

02:04:26.826 --> 02:04:28.527
ROBUST PLAN ON HOW TO GET RID

02:04:28.594 --> 02:04:31.063
OF CONTRABAND. IN PRISONS I

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:32.898
WOULD I WOULD EMBRACE IT LOVE

02:04:32.965 --> 02:04:38.103
IT HECK WE WOULD EVEN. FUND.

02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:40.472
MISTER JONES SAWYER. HI THIS IS

02:04:40.539 --> 02:04:42.675
TAMMY IRWIN AGAIN. I'M I WOULD

02:04:42.741 --> 02:04:44.243
LIKE TO SAY THAT IT IT DOES

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:45.678
APPEAR AS THOUGH THE-

02:04:45.744 --> 02:04:47.112
INSTITUTIONS WHERE WE HAVE

02:04:47.179 --> 02:04:49.181
MANAGED ACCESS TO PLAY DO HAVE.

02:04:49.248 --> 02:04:52.351
FEWER CONFISCATION- OF.

02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:56.255
CONTRABAND I'M- ALSO. I'M WE DO

02:04:56.322 --> 02:04:57.990
BELIEVE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY

02:04:58.057 --> 02:04:59.525
ONCE DEPLOYED ONCE THE

02:04:59.592 --> 02:05:00.960
CONTRABAND REACHES INSIDE THE

02:05:01.026 --> 02:05:02.361
PRESIDENT OF CONTRABAND.

02:05:02.428 --> 02:05:04.630
CELLULAR DEVICES ARE INSIDE THE

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.599
PRESIDENT. THAT MANAGE ACCESS

02:05:06.665 --> 02:05:11.470
IS THE TECHNOLOGY- THAT HELPS

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:13.539
TO- WORK THROUGH AND THE

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:16.008
DETERRENT OF- BRINGING IN

02:05:16.075 --> 02:05:17.343
ADDITIONAL DEVICES ESPECIALLY

02:05:17.409 --> 02:05:19.712
WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

02:05:19.778 --> 02:05:22.147
NEW WARRANT PROCESS. WHERE WE

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:24.650
ARE WRITING A WARRANT TO THEN

02:05:24.717 --> 02:05:26.652
DE ACTIVATE DEVICES I

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:28.220
PERMANENTLY SO WE'RE HOPING

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:29.154
THAT THAT WILL URTHER

02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:30.322
DETERMINE THAT IS A STILL A

02:05:30.389 --> 02:05:32.224
FAIRLY NEW PROCESS I WITH THIS

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:33.559
MANAGED ACCESS SYSTEM AND WE

02:05:33.626 --> 02:05:34.760
WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO

02:05:34.827 --> 02:05:37.997
CONTINUE. WITH THAT- BUT THAT

02:05:38.063 --> 02:05:41.567
PROCESS AND TO FEED BE A DEEPER

02:05:41.634 --> 02:05:43.002
IMPACT BUT IT MAY HAVE. CAN I

02:05:43.068 --> 02:05:45.437
WOULD BE WAITING TO HEAR THE

02:05:45.504 --> 02:05:48.674
EFFECTIVENESS OF IT- IT'S NOT

02:05:48.741 --> 02:05:49.275
THE DISK COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE

02:05:49.341 --> 02:05:50.743
TO HEAR THAT TOO THANK YOU. THE

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:53.445
SYSTEM. THANK YOU KNOW I JUST

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:54.680
ALSO WANT TO MAKE THE POINT

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:56.882
THAT THE MANAGE ACCESS SERVICE

02:05:56.949 --> 02:05:57.716
IS TO PREVENT THE CELL FROM

02:05:57.783 --> 02:05:59.919
FROM WORKING BUT WHAT IS REALLY

02:05:59.985 --> 02:06:02.488
IMPORTANT HERE THAT I THINK WE

02:06:02.554 --> 02:06:03.522
SHOULD NOT OVERLOOK IS THAT

02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:05.190
WHAT CITIES HERE IS PROPOSING

02:06:05.257 --> 02:06:06.859
WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING IS

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:09.161
DECOUPLING. HOW THEY'RE PAYING

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:10.296
FOR THE MAN'S ACCESS SERVICE

02:06:10.362 --> 02:06:11.597
AND IF WE'RE PAYING FOR IT THAT

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:13.565
MEANS THE PRISONERS. THEMSELVES

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:15.301
OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED. WHO

02:06:15.367 --> 02:06:17.503
HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR THROUGH

02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:20.205
EXORBITANT TELEPHONE FEES. ARE

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:21.440
GOING TO BE PAYING FOR IT AND

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:25.110
SO FOR US TO TAKE THAT. EXPENSE

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:27.479
ON IS GOOD. BECAUSE WE'RE

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.748
TAKING AWAY FROM PROBLEM HOW

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:31.283
THAT HAS BEEN FUNDED BUT IT

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:32.952
ALSO GIVES US BETTER INSIGHT

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.753
INTO THE COSTS AND DEMANDS THAT

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:35.421
SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT'S A

02:06:35.487 --> 02:06:37.656
GOOD SYSTEM AND NEEDS TO BE

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:40.392
EXPLORED. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO

02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:43.128
LOOK AT THE WAY THAT JAILS AND

02:06:43.195 --> 02:06:45.264
PRISONS HAVE BEEN. UTILIZING

02:06:45.331 --> 02:06:47.099
AND BENEFITING FROM THE

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:48.968
TELEPHONE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY

02:06:49.034 --> 02:06:50.602
HAVE BEEN USING THE REVENUES

02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:52.171
FROM THAT SERVICE TO FIND A

02:06:52.237 --> 02:06:54.473
NUMBER DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WHICH

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:55.040
AGAIN IS JUST THE WRONG WAY

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:56.942
AROUND. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

02:06:57.009 --> 02:06:58.344
VISIBILITY AND HOW THOSE KINDS

02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:00.479
OF PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED. AND

02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:01.847
THEN THE CONTRCTOR THE

02:07:01.914 --> 02:07:03.749
TELEPHONE PROVIDER IS MAKING A

02:07:03.816 --> 02:07:05.751
LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THE PEOPLE

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:06.852
WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE PHONE

02:07:06.919 --> 02:07:09.254
CALLS AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:07:09.321 --> 02:07:11.924
MOST EXPENSIVE PHONE CALLS.

02:07:11.991 --> 02:07:12.791
THAT THAT I COULD EVER EVEN

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:15.728
IMAGINE. AND ANTITHETICAL TO

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:18.063
WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING SO

02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:19.565
MANAGING COMMUNICATIONS IN A

02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:21.633
BETTER WAY. AND TAKING KIND OF

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:23.302
CONTROL OF WHAT THOSE WHAT IT

02:07:23.369 --> 02:07:27.006
HAD BEEN. FUNDED THROUGH THOSE

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:29.274
CONTRACTS IS REALLY WHAT THIS

02:07:29.341 --> 02:07:31.210
IS ALSO ABOUT AND THIS IS A

02:07:31.276 --> 02:07:33.112
GOOD THING I THINK IS TO SHIFT

02:07:33.178 --> 02:07:34.580
HOW THIS EXPENSES HAPPENING

02:07:34.646 --> 02:07:36.415
GIVING US BETTER VISIBILITY BUT

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:38.751
THEN ALSO UNDERSTANDING. THAT

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:40.886
TECHNOLOGY BETTER AND HOW THAT

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:43.889
BECOMES A DETERRENT. TO THE USE

02:07:43.956 --> 02:07:45.991
OF CELLPHONES BECAUSE AS IF HIS

02:07:46.058 --> 02:07:47.760
CELL PHONE IS NO LONGER USABLE

02:07:47.826 --> 02:07:50.262
INSIDE. AND THROUGH A SYSTEM

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:52.531
LIKE THIS CAN BE IDENTIFIED. IN

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:55.634
BE SHUT DOWN AND LOCATED THEN

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:56.235
THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE THE

02:07:56.301 --> 02:07:58.270
TECHNOLOGY. SO THAT'S WHY I

02:07:58.337 --> 02:08:00.039
THINK THIS IS THIS IS A GOOD

02:08:00.105 --> 02:08:01.173
TRACK AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:04.343
AT. THE WAYS WE HAVE BANNED

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:05.444
UTILIZING SOME OF THESE

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:07.279
CONTRACTS IN HAD BEEN DONE FOR

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:10.149
FISCAL REASONS. BUT UTILIZE

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:12.084
THESE CONTRACTS N. AND THEN

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:13.685
PASSING ON THE EXPENSES

02:08:13.752 --> 02:08:15.687
INAPPROPRIATELY THE PEOPLE WHO

02:08:15.754 --> 02:08:20.492
ARE INCARCERATED. I THANK YOU

02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:22.161
FOR THAT INFORMATION- MISTER

02:08:22.227 --> 02:08:27.366
SUN THAT PERSPECTIVE. OKAY SO

02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:29.535
JUST WE WERE AGAIN WE WILL BE

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:33.639
TAKING ACTION TODAY- AN EXCITED

02:08:33.705 --> 02:08:35.174
ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY DISCUSSION

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.508
THAT THIS TOOK PLACE AND JUST

02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:40.212
WANTED TO COUPLE UP ON THE-

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:41.547
FROM THE DRUG DISCUSSION SINCE

02:08:41.613 --> 02:08:42.414
THEN THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT

02:08:42.481 --> 02:08:43.549
WE'RE ALSO SEEING AN INCREASE

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:45.084
GOING ON EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:45.551
LESS MOVEMENT UNLESS

02:08:45.617 --> 02:08:47.686
VISITATION. AS YOU GUYS ARE

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:48.854
WORKING ON THAT SO I HOPE IN

02:08:48.921 --> 02:08:51.457
THE FUTURE I IT AFTER YOUR- GET

02:08:51.523 --> 02:08:53.892
THE REPORT FROM. HEALTHY FAST

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:55.561
THOUGH YOU'RE ABLE TO SHARE

02:08:55.627 --> 02:08:56.862
WITH THE SOME ADDITIONAL

02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:58.864
STRIDES HE'S GOING TO BE USING

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.499
TO HELP PREVENT THE CONTRABAND

02:09:00.566 --> 02:09:02.401
FROM COMING INTO THE FACILITIES

02:09:02.468 --> 02:09:03.769
SO WERE LITTLE BETTER EQUIPPED

02:09:03.836 --> 02:09:07.372
TO HELP OUR AND MATES- BE ABLE

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:08.373
TO BE SUCCESSFUL AS THEY'RE

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.975
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THEIR

02:09:10.042 --> 02:09:11.243
SUBSTANCE ABUSE. HEALTHCARE SO

02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:14.813
WITH THAT I'M AND I'M GONNA GO

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:15.380
AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO PUBLIC

02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:19.118
COMMENT NOW. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT

02:09:19.184 --> 02:09:20.686
