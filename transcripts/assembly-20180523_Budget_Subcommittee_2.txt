CERTAINLY PLEASED TO PROVIDE A PLAN THAT. THAT'S A REALLY ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA WHERE THAT CERTAINLY THAT. TALKED ABOUT FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. IN THE GLOBE THAT WE'RE NOT ALWAYS UP THERE AS FAR IS ADEQUATELY FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT SAD. TODAY'S BUDGET THIS YEAR WILL ALLOW US TO GET CLOSER TO TO THAT MARKER SO I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE. NOTABLE INVESTMENTS WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS YEAR. AND I'LL BEGIN BY. TALKING ABOUT COARSER LCF AFTER PROGRAM AND I THE GET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WE KNOW. FULLY FUNDS LCF F. IN AND OUT FRONT LOADS THE FUNDING OUR EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED AND OUR BUDGET INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED LEVEL FOR LCF AT. BASE FUNDING WHICH WE HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND CALIFORNIA. FOR A TOTAL OF THREE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR LCF AT IMPLEMENTATION THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO INCLUDE INTENT LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE. PASSED AROUND TO INCREASE THE LC AT THAT TARGET BASE RATES. BEGINNING IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. BUDGET WE THOUGHT THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ITEM TO ADDRESS I KNOW MISTER MARTZ SUITS YOU BROUGHT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S ATTENTION. OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THAT WERE ALSO LOOKING TO INVEST THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION TO CREATE A NEW SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT FOR OUR LOWEST PERFORMING A SUBGROUP THROUGH THE LCF AFT. ALLOCATION WE THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE EMISSIONS IN THE FIRST. EARLIER IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE ELSE IF THAT PROGRAM. AND WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY FUNDING FOR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. CT <u>&lt;c.green&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;</u> OF CREEK TECHNICAL EDUCATION AT TOP PRIORITY FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE ANNA BIPARTISAN ONE AS WELL YOU WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE DID TWO THINGS. EXPANDED THE ONGOIN FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS THAT WERE ESSENTIALLY DOUBLING. BUT THE GOVERNOR HAD IN JANUARY BUDGET TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING. AND PROVIDING LANGUAGE THAT WE. CONTINUE THE. THE IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WE ARE. PROVIDING TWO HUNDRED MILLION TOWARDS EQUALIZING SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES. A NOT FULLY BUT PARTIALLY ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES WHICH I KNOW. ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL AND I TALKED ABOUT IN A JOINT COMMITTEE. IN THE SPRING IT'S ALLOWS US TO PARTIALLY ADDRESS HAT. WE ARE PROVIDING HUNDRED. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE AN ADD ON TO INCENTIVIZE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS TOO MANY OF OUR. KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS AND FORCE THEY ARE PART DAY. IMPACT FAMILIES AND PARENTS AS WELL AS LIMITS. EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES SO THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT VESTMENTS. WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S FAR AS. SQUEEZING ACCESS THIS OVERALL POPULATION OVERALL SLOTS AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES SO WE'RE. PLEASED TO PROVIDE SEVENTY SIX MILLION ONGOING FOR ACES PROGRAMS. WE HAVE FIFTY MILLION. ONE TIME FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR OUR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE SUMMER FURLOUGH FIND. TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO OUT ON FOR AFTER SCHOOL EFFORTS TO. HELP CREATE COMPUTER CODING PROGRAMS THAT ARE EXISTING AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME FOR TEACHER RESIDENCY. PROGRAMS AND WE'RE GOING TO BROUGHT IN. THE. APPLICATION THAT PROPOSAL NOT JUST FOR SPECIAL ED THE FOR ALL HARD TO SERVE AREAS SO THAT. A A RECAP OF OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE AND. SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE'RE ALSO GOING TO. INCLUDING THIS PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. A PIECE THAT THAT OF THE BUDGET AND THAT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT TWO MAJOR PROPOSALS HERE WE HAVE. AND ASSEMBLY I AM RESPONSIVE THAT ONE IS REALLY TO THE GOVERNOR'S ONLINE COLLEGE PROPOSAL. AYE WE'RE GOING TO REJECT THAT PROPOSAL. WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT COMMUNICABLE JUST. IRAQ CALIFORNIA ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH WITH FLEXIBLE PROGRAMS ALLOWING OLDER ADULT WORKERS STRANDED WORKERS TO TAKE AYE COURSES RELATE TO SHORT TERM. OUTCOMES. BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS A THE RIGHT APPROACH HERE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER IN IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. WE ARE ASKING OUR EXISTING COLLEGES TO STEP UP AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES THROUGH EXISTING ONLINE EDUCATION. RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S FUNDING FORMULA PROPOSAL FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE. WE'VE EMBRACE THIS THIS IDEA FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW THINK IT'S A WORTHY. INCLUSION AS WE HAVE DONE WITH IN K. TWELVE WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND. HAVE A DON'T THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS READY FOR US. NOT PRIME TIME JUST YET RASKIN THE CHANCELLOR AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE TASK FORCE. THAT INCLUDES STAKEHOLDERS. THROUGHOUT THE FALL AND TO COME BACK COME BACK TO US NEXT YEAR WITH CONSENSUS AS WE DID WITH THE LCF PROPOSAL A FEW YEARS AGO. WE ALSO KNOW THE LOT OF COLLEGES ARE IN TROUBLE UNDER THE CURRENT FUNDING FORMULA WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENTS. SIR WE PROVIDE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT ALL COLLEGES ARE HELD HARMLESS FROM ENROLLMENT DECLINES AND RECEIVE A CALL AT. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND REAL ON ACT FORMULA LATER THIS NEXT YEAR. AS EARLY THERE OUGHT LOT OF OTHER ELEMENTS I KNOW WE TOOK A LOT OF THE THE OXYGEN OUT OF THE ROOM LATER THESE TWO PROPOSALS BUT. CERTAINLY VERY PLEASED WITH THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE WE'RE ABLE TO. REALLY I INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE A SYSTEM A FEW HIGHLIGHTS ARE FIFTY FIVE MILLION. TO INCREASE FULL TIME FACULTY AND BETTER SUPPORT PART TIME FACULTY WITH FACULTY OFFICE HOURS. AND WE STREAMLINED TO COMMUNICABLE IS FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. TO SIMPLIFY THESE THESE EFFORTS PROVIDE MORE A NON TUITION A TO COMMITTEE CALLED STUDENTS. INCENTIVIZE STUDENTS TO TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS OF PER SEMESTER THIRTY UNITS THROUGH THAT THROUGH THE COLLEGE YEAR AND HELP SENSE TO GET THROUGH COLLEGE MORE QUICKLY. WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION FOR INCOMMUNICADO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. A SIX MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR OUR SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY PROGRAM. AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME TO SUPPORT OUR. VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS ONE IT HAD KNOWLEDGE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL WILL PUT% TOGETHER THIS PROPOSAL IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUDGET. SO I THAT THAT WE HAVE. FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PIECE OF PROP TWENTY EIGHTH. YES SO BEFORE WE. PROCEED WITH THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE VOTES THERE WILL BE SOME SOME ITEMS WE. TAKE OUT HAVE SUB VOTES ANY ITEM ANY COMMENTS FROM. A COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE DISCUSSION. I HAVE A DONALD SO TO YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY FULL ITEMS OFF THAT LISTS OF JIM CARREY GREAT. DID YOU WANT GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE HOPE NOT MANY PROPOSAL TO. I'LL JUST GIVE YOU SOME THOUGHTS WE OUGHT SPEAKERS OF THE TO THE FULL DAY CARE PROPOSAL. THAT GIVES ME CONCERN BECAUSE THATSTRIKES ME AS A WANT VERSES IN NEED. AND THE MAY EXPLAIN WHY I'M IF THAT MONEY IS TARGETED TOWARDS A DUPLICATE STUDENTS THAT IS THOSE STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEED THOSE STUDENTS. WHO FALL UNDER THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT WE'RE TARGETING A NEED? BUT IT'S IT'S JUST OFFER YOU NO LONGER SCHOOL DAYS OF PARENTS DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE CHILDCARE I DON'T THINK THAT'S. AN APPROPRIATE USE THE MONEY SO HOPE GOING FLORIDA NOT APPLAUD I'M NOT AS WE PULL THIS I MUST SIMPLY. BUT HOPE THAT FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE AS WE GO FORWARD REALLY LOOK AT. TARGETING THIS MONEY TOWARDS THOSE STUDENTS THAT CAN BETTER BENEFIT FROM FULL DAY CANDOR AND DON'T HAVE IT NOW. THEN THOSE STUDENTS WHO MIGHT NOT. THAT THANK YOU. THIS ARE MURATSUCHI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I UP. WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR. WORKING WITH ME TO INCORPORATE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA LEGISLATIVE INTENT LANGUAGE. OF FOR THE TO EXPRESS INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE. THE LCF AT. TARGET BASE RATE. I I WANT TO CLARIFY. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE THAT THE WORK MORE TALK ABOUT THE BASE RATE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BASS GRANT. PORTION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FOR. CORRECT OKAY SO THIS IS TO. IMPLEMENT. THAT AT LEAST THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO. SET AN ASPIRATIONAL TARGET. TO INCREASE THE BASE RATE. GIVEN THE TESTIMONY THAT WE RECEIVED FROM. URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ABOUT THE INADEQUACY OF THE BASE RATE EYES ACCRA MISTER CHAIR. YES THANK YOU WELL STATED THANK YOU. FUTURE MARRIAGE COMMENT ON THE PROPOSAL. THAT I JUST WANNA THANK YOU ESTHER MURATSUCHI FOR BRING THAT FORWARD. AND THAT IS TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE ESTABLISHES HARD TARGETS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. BUT ALSO I THINK FOR THIS BODY I MEAN THE WHOLE LEGISLATIVE BODY IN THE GUT THE NEW GOVERNOR AS WE WE HAD A NEXT YEAR. IT ALSO SETS UP A PARADIGM THAT WE SUPPORT LCF F. WE SUPPORT LOCAL CONTROL. AND WE DON'T GO BACK TO THE AGE OF CATEGORICAL SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT FORD. EXCEPT FOR ONE CATEGORICAL WE LIKE THAT'S THEIR CAREER TECHNICAL I WOULD LATER. HAVE CLOSE THAT'S ACTUALLY A NEED MISTER CHAIR I NEED OUT OF ONE. YEAH. YEAH. MUSLIM OF. I THINK YOU AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION I GETTING TO THIS POINT AND I WANT TO THINK THAT CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. OF FOR GETTING US ADD TO THIS POINT ADDITIONALLY I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT'S COME UP WAS AROUND. CHILD CARE. AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. WHERE WE'RE GONNA DO THAT JUST NEXT? SO THEN I WANT. YEAH. BUT PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKETS ANY COMMENTS ON THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT THERE WERE A LOT AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GET TO A A GOOD POINT I THINK ESPECIALLY WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA BASE. WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD. A LOT FROM AND DISTRICTS AS WELL AS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. I'M SOME OF THE TOP ISSUES NOT THE ONLYIMPORTANT ISSUES BUT ON ISSUES THAT ARE GENERATED A LOT OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION. MISS THEIR. LAST YEAR EACH. MEMBER CHáVEZ THANK YOU YES RIGHT AFTER SIX YEARS. I'M GONNA PROBABLY. PRODUCE IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY. THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS IN HERE THAT ARE REALLY GOOD THAT WE WERE MOVING RIGHT DIRECTION BUT. SIX YEARS AGO YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA WAS RAIDED. WHAT FORTY NINTH IN THE NATION AS FAR AS EDUCATION NOW IF YOU WERE FORTY THREE? SO WE WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BY. THERE SOME OF THEM MEMBERS ITEMS OUT THERE YOU WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE BEFORE AND THAT'S. IMPORTANT ME FOR. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF EQUITY. AND NAGS CHILDREN THAT WERE BEING LOST. IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T READY TO GO TO SCHOOL WHEN THEY STARTED IN THE FIRST VERSE DO THREE A THREE. AND THAT WAS INVESTMENT THAT WE HAD DONE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND HOW TO GET THERE. ONE OF THE NUMBERS I READ THE OTHER DAY THAT I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING AS WITH THE HOPE. GROUP LAST NIGHT. THE FASTEST GROWING GRADUATION RATE IN THE STATE IS THAT AT OUR LATINAS. THEY WERE GOING UP GRADUATION RATES SIX PERCENT PER YEAR FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. AND THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT. A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE MOVING FORWARD IS LEADERS WITHIN OUR. WITH OUR ECONOMY. WE SOMETIMES APPEAR WILL ARGUE OVER. A PARTICULAR PROGRAM OR I WANT THIS SHINY ROCK BUT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I THINK WE NEED TO STAND BACK LOOK AT OURSELVES. AND HOPE THE PRESS GETS THIS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S MOVING FOR YOU LOOK AT OUR UP ARE YOU OUR CHILDREN BEING PREPARED TO GO FOR HIGHER ED. ANY STATE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ALWAYS HAS TWO OR THREE OF THE TOP TEN. AND YOU ONLY HAVE THOSE COULD YOU HAVE GREAT PEOPLE IN THE K. TWELVE PROGRAM COMING FORWARD. AND I THINK THE LOCAL ELECTORAL FUNDING TO DASH BOARD. OF THE INVESTMENT WE MADE IN TEACHERS A BRING IN TECHNOLOGY WITHIN OUR SCHOOLS. THE ISSUE OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. ALL THOSE ARE REALLY GREAT THINGS GOING FOR THAT WE NEVER EVER TALK ABOUT. IN MY DISTRICT AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS TWO POINT SEVEN. AND THAT'S PRETTY DARN GOOD. AND I CAN TELL HAVING WALKED NEIGHBORHOODS FOR THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS. THAT. SIX SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WALKED NEIGHBORHOODS PEOPLE WERE STRESSED. LAWNS WERE DYING AND PEOPLE WANT PAIN IN THEIR FRONT DOORS THINGS ARTS UPGRADE PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT THE SCHOOLS WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE THEY TALKED ABOUT THE SCHOOLS. WHEN I TALKED GO THROUGH THERE NOW PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE SATISFIED FEEL EMPOWERED THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE LOGAN DRAW FUNDING. AND THE AND THE EL CAP AND THE I THINK THE RISE OF THE IMPORTS OF THE PTA. SO LOT OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING HERE AS FAR AS CTE SPECIAL EDUCATION AFTER SCHOOL SUPPORTING CHARTER'S. EVEN LOOKING HERE WE HAVE SOME ITEMS OUT THERE DON'T CALLED OUT IN THAT IS THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR. RECOGNIZING THE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK IN OUR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES I'M MOVING ACROSS THE. THE ESTATE WORKING TO ASSURE ONE OF OUR MOST VIBRANT AREAS AGRICULTURE GO FORWARD THERE WERE MISSING THE OPPORTUNITY OF EDUCATION BOARD RECOGNIZING. THEIR WORK CARE. SO. FOR THE PUBLIC THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF HAS HAPPENED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN EDUCATION AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT. THE NEXT GOVERNOR COMES IN ALL HAVE THE SAME SORT OF. ARE ONLY COMES ENVISIONED AT THE GOVERNOR BROWN HIS HAD AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO THERE'S SOME THINGS WE'RE GONNA PLOT HERE. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO IS REPUBLICANS WE GOT A VOTE NO ON SOME. BUT THE. BUT THE BUT THE LARGER GENERAL ISSUE IS IS THAT. THIS ISN'T A BAD PROGRAM WILL MAKE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS FOR THE FAMILIES OF CALIFORNIA. OKAY MISTER VOEPEL. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT I WAS THAT. A POPULAR ITEM FOR FOR MANY IN OUR CAUCUS BUT WE DO FIND THE FULLTIME COMMUNITY. A FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSAL AS WELL SO. BUT OVERALL BEFORE TAKE THE VOTES I WILL NOTE THAT AND WE WON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST. FORTIFIED BILLION DOLLARS IN PROP NINETY EIGHT TEN. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY NEXT YEAR AND SO. I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US. TO DO IT WISELY IN AND I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW SOMEONE SAY THAT. THROWING MONEY AT EDUCATION. ISN'T ALWAYS THE ANSWER BUT I THINK WE LOOK AT WHAT OUR CHALLENGES ARE. AND OUT WHAT WORKS AND I THINK THAT. WHAT WE'VE DONE NETWORK WE WE HEARD FROM OUR? SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TALKING AS FAR AS JUST. OVERALL MONEY THROUGH OUR LCF FAST AND LOCAL CONTROL AND WE WERE ADDRESSING THAT. LOOKING AT PROGRAMS THAT YOU KNOW WORK AND WE HAVE A HUGE. DEMAND IN SUPPORT FOR LIKE MIKE CTE AND WHERE DO WERE DOING THAT. A SIMILAR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS LOOKING A PROBLEM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SEE HOW WE CAN. ADDRESS THAT'S IN WERE FOR ADDRESSING THAT AS WELL SO. CERTAINLY THINK THAT WHERE AND WE'RE STEPPING UP IN THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT WELLNESS FARSCAPE TWELVE AND I MAY SAY WE'RE NOT THROWING MONEY IN EDUCATION. FOR INVESTING MONEY IN OUR PEOPLE IN EDUCATION SO YES WE ARE A GOOD THING. GOOD DATA INVEST IN EDUCATION HERE TODAY SO WITH THAT WE WILL START THE. VOTES NOW IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE.

THIS IS THE EARLY CARE AND. EDUCATION. PACKAGE ARE. WE SEE PACKAGE. RIGHT. ONE. OKAY THIS IS OUR E. C. E. PACKAGE HERE AND. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE. REALLY EXCITED ABOUT I KNOW MISTER CHAVEZ TOUCHED ALREADY AND MISS LEE MON WILL WILL WILL SPEAK TO AS WELL. WE HAD CERTAINLY A ROBUST HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO. ABOUT ARE EASY AND. THAT EFFORTS HEARING CALIFORNIA KNOWING THAT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. TOOK A BIG BIG HIT AND WE TRY TO ADDRESS THAT THE PAST FEW YEARS BUT CERTAINLY. HAVE NOT GONE ALL THE WAY. AND I THINK WITH WITH THIS PROPOSAL TODAY WHERE WE'RE JUST ABOUT THERE. OVER ANNUALIZED THIS WILL PROVIDE. NORTH OF NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO MEET THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF OUR CHILDREN. ZERO THREE SIX AND THOSE CHILDREN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. A HIGHLIGHTS OF THESE YOU SEE OUR PROGRAMS AND PACKAGE INCLUDE. NEARLY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM SLOTS AND THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED GENERAL CHILD CARE. SLOTS FOR OUR FAMILIES AND ADDITIONAL FIVE THOUSAND STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS THE GOVERNOR ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. ADDRESSES THAT PART DAY LICENSE EXEMPT RATES. INCREASES THE INFANT AND TODDLER ADJUSTMENT FACTOR AND THE SPECIAL NEEDS ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. A AS A BIG CONVERSATION PIECE KNOWING THAT ARE INFANTILE THEIR PROGRAMS ARE REALLY STRUGGLING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO TO STEP UP. AS WELL THAT WE PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED MILLION AT ONE TIME FUNDING TO ADDRESS FACILITY NEEDS FOR FULL FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND WE MAKE OTHER. CHANGES TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS TO ALLOW FOR MORE READING OF FUNDING I KNOW THAT'S VERY A GENERIC BUT SO I'M. THIS I THINK WILL GO A LONG WAY IN HELPING. BLENDS ARE. SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS WITH OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT T. K. AND REALLY WE'VE HEARD FROM DISTRICTS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE FIELD AS FAR AS WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. EVEN WE'VE INCREASED OUR RATES LAST YEAR'S AND ALSO INCREASE NUMBER OF SLOTS BUT IT ISN'T ALWAYS WORKING AND SO WE THINK THIS WHAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ADDRESS THAT THERE'S ONE PIECE ALSO AND I WENT TO ADDRESS THIS STARTED. THREE YEARS AGO I THINK. THEN ASSEMBLY BUDGET CHAIR DR WEBER. NOTED THAT TOO MANY FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR TKO A BECAUSE ARE NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THEIR BABIES BORN DURING THE FALL MONTHS. AND THEY'RE NOT INCOME ELIGIBLE. BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU MAKE LET'S SAY SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER FAMILY OF THREE OR FOUR IN SAN DIEGO OR SACRAMENTO. DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN AFFORD. THE COST OF REALLY EDUCATION AS WE KNOW. SO WHILE WE ARE GOING TO THAT TO THAT ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THAT BY LOOKING AT OUR NEW AYE STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS. AND LOOKING AT THE INCOME LIMITS AND IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE AN ALLEY A DOING ST PRESCHOOL A TITLE ONE SCHOOL. WE WON'T HAVE THOSE INCOME LIMITS WILL TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO MAKE ONE THAT PROGRAMS AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO FIND PARTICIPANTS AND CAL UP THOSE SLOTS BUT ALSO. FOR PARENTS AND FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN AND IN A NEARBY. AND NEIGHBORHOOD ONCE A VENTURE OVER TO THAT ON SCHOOL TO BE A SLOT FOR YOU AS WELL SO WE THINK THAT. ADDRESSES. THE I DESIRE OF THAT ABOUT THREE K. FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA NOT FULLY THEY'RE NOT ALL THE WAY THERE THINK THIS GOES. A CERTAINLY A LONG WAY. I WITH THAT YOU KNOW MISS LEE MONN WANTED TO HAVE SOME. WANT TO SHARE SOME COMMENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU CHAIR THAT I DID IT AND I THINK THE COMMENTS TO OUR. COMMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD. OVER THE LAST MONTH OR SO AND WE'VE HAD MEMBERS OF THE AND THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HERE I'M TALKING AND ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE. AYE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AND SPECIFICALLY AB ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ONE TIME FUNDS FOR OUR FACILITIES AND START UP COSTS UNRELATED TO THIS. ON PART OF THE. WHILE THIS BUDGET AND OTHER BUDGETS. HELP US GET TO A BETTER PLACE AND THEY DON'T HELP US MEET THE NEED THAT IS OUT THERE. OR MEET THE FULL NEED. THAT IS OUT THERE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE SLOTS ARE MINIMAL. ON SLOTS ARE VERY MUCH NEEDED AND WE HOPE. THAT I IN A TIME WHERE. WHERE THERE'S A LOW BUT THERE'S A LOT OF? A LOT OF GREATER NEEDS AND WE DON'T FORGET THAT THE INVESTMENT WE MAKE VERY EARLY ON AND THE FACT THAT THE STATE. IS IN A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE WORKING WITH A SURPLUS AND WE MAY NOT BE HERE YEAR AFTER YEAR ON THIS IS A TIME. A TIMELY MATTER IN MAKING THIS INVESTMENT NOW.

SO I THANK THE CHAIR FOR THAT. ALSO WANNA THANK THE STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT HERE TODAY BUT HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN EVERYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE STATE WHETHER WAS HERE IN SACRAMENTO OR WHETHER IT WAS OUR HEARINGS. I END AT FRESNO CITY COLLEGE OR AT UC RIVERSIDE WHERE WE SAW. A STUDENT AFTER STUDENT. SPEAK ON ON THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND HIGHER EDUCATION. WERE THE STUDENTS WON'T HAVE TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF CONTINUING TO RAISE HIGHER TUITION. SO AYE I THINK IT'S A A GOOD FIRST STEP AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OTHER YEARS WHERE WE CAN CONTINUE.

WHILE THIS THE GOOD BUDGET YEAR AND THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO FULLY MEET THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA'S FUNDING REQUEST. THAT. THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IS IS THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO. TO BE SPENT ON INCREASING ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND LESS MONEY TO BE SPENT ON ADMINISTRATION. AND. AYE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT PRINCIPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. WORKING TO THIS A VERY GOOD BUDGET PACKAGE. I THINK AN ECHO THE THINKS TO ARE CHAIR. AND TO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT MEANING GATES I THINK IT'S REFLECTIVE OF. WHAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MEANS I TO OUR STATE BUT ALSO TO THE STUDENTS I'M WHO ARE ALUMNI WHO GO TO THIS AT UNIVERSITY? IE THAT. YOU KNOW I I HAVE AND I THINK I THINK THAT THE BUDGET IS REFLECTIVE UP OR. AT LEAST THE ASSEMBLY IS PROPOSAL IS REFLECTIVE OF OUR INTEREST IN TRYING TO BUY. ENSURE THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S UMBILICAL FOR MORE STUDENTS AND FROM OUR STUDENTS IN OUR STATE. AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE WE WANT TO CONSIDER. ENDING WE DO IN THIS BUDGET DEFINITELY DOES INCREASE. AND THEY HAVE TARGETS FOR ADMISSION GROWTH AND WE HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHOSE NEEDS. ARE SUCH AND THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF NOT JUST PROVIDING SPOTS BUT ALSO A QUALITY EDUCATION. AND I THINK THAT WE ARE GETTING THERE I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA. IS WORKING HARD AT THIS IS A GOOD YEAR. IT MAY NOT BE A GOOD HERE IN THE FUTURE SO I GO BACK TO WHAT'S BEEN SAID IN PRIOR COMMITTEES. ABOUT THE NEED TO THINK TO HAVE A LONG TERM VISION AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE AS A STATE TO MAKE THIS LEVEL OF INVESTMENT EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND WE WILL HAVE. HERE. AND SO I HOPE THAT THIS INVESTMENT. THIS YEAR ID INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE IN THE PAST AND THE COMMITMENT TO TRY TO. INSURE WORK. OPENING SPOTS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WERE OPENING SPOTS. FOR PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IS TRYING TO DO BETTER ABOUT MEETING THE NEEDS OF CURRENT STUDENTS ISN'T LOST WHEN THAT WHEN. I'M IN A HALF I HATE TO SAY BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES AND. CALIFORNIA'S I FISCAL OUTLOOK IS IS A DIFFERENT REALITY THAT WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW. JEFF JARVIS. YOU I KNOW THERE'S A LOT A STATEMENT CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL IN THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ECONOMY SHIFT IN THE FUTURE. AND. BUT. I WON'T BE HERE BUT A CAUTION I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN EDUCATION. AND THE PAST SIX YEARS. WHEN BUDGETS ARE SET OF PRIORITIES. AND I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND. EVEN IN A HARD TIME COMING IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST. IN EDUCATION BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT EVERY STUDY SHOWS THAT. INVESTMENT EDUCATION RETURNS A FIVER SEVEN FOLD RETURN IN THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE. MAKE MONEY AND HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS WE DO. ACROSS THE BUDGET. MET. THE VAST MAJORITY IN ON HER DON'T HAVE THAT RETURN. SAU JUST ASK YOU TO. CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EARLY CHILD EDUCATION KATIE TWELVE CHANGES. OUR CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; OUR COMMUNITY&lt;/c&gt;</u> COLLEGES BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GROW THE ECONOMY AND DEAL EQUITY ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN. OF COLOR COMING FROM REALLY STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENTS SO I'D HOPE THAT WE. IN THE FUTURE WE DON'T BACK DOWN ON EDUCATION I WOULD SAY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT DON'T.
