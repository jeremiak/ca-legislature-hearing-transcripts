THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD 2% AB SIX EIGHTY THREE A BILL THAT UPDATES THE OUTDATED MEDI CAL ASSETS TEST TO ALLOW SENIORS. ACCESS TO MUCH NEEDED HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ONCE AN ADULT TURN SIXTY FIVE OR BECOMES MEDICARE ELIGIBLE THERE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED BY A RESTRICTIVE SET OF RULES THAT REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE MINIMAL ASSETS TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE. THE LIMIT IS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE AMOUNTS THAT HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED SINCE I WAS NINE YEARS OLD IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. THE UNINTENDED RESULT IS THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REMAIN MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE ELIGIBLE DEPLETE ALL OF THE RESOURCES TO CONTINUE RECEIVING BENEFITS. THE MEDICAL PROGRAM HAS ALLOWED CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS TO THE ASSETS TEST INCLUDING EXCEPTIONS FOR SOMEONE'S PRIMARY RESIDENCE. HOWEVER THESE POLICIES ARE INEQUITABLE- ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE DISPARITIES IN HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE A LOW INCOME SENIOR WHO OWNS AN EXPENSIVE HOME CAN QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL BUT A RENTER WITH THE SAME INCOME WILL NOT QUALIFY IF THEY'D HAD. TWO THOUSAND AND ONE DOLLARS IN THE BANK AB SIX EIGHTY THREE WILL UPDATE THESE ASSETS LIMITS TO THAT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROGRAMS. SERVING SENIORS AND FIVE THOUSAND FOR INDIVIDUALS ADDITION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL- IN THE HOUSEHOLD. THE BILL WILL ALSO ELIMINATE THE ASSETS TEST FOR MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAM PROGRAMS OR MEDICAL PAYS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL'S MEDICARE PREMIUMS AND CO PAYMENTS.

MR MULLIN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. PRESENTE AB NINE NINE TWO TO MODERNIZE THE BROWN ACTS EIGHT AB NINE NINE TO SIMPLY CLARIFIES THAT MEMBERS OF LOCAL ELECTED BODIES MAY ENGAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDED THEY DO NOT INTERACT IN ANY WAY THAT VIOLATES THE RALPH M. BROWN ACT LANDMARK LAW FROM NINETEEN FIFTY THREE MORE SPECIFICALLY AB NINE NINE TWO ALLOWS MEMBERS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDED THAT A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS DO NOT DISCUSS AMONG THEMSELVES BUSINESS OF A SPECIFIC NATURE. THAT IS WITHIN THE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE LOCAL AGENCY AB NINE NINE TWO DOES NOT UNDERMINE EXISTING BRADDOCK PROHIBITIONS BUT CLARIFIES THE GREAT. WHO OFFICIALS AND THEIR TEAMS ARE STRUGGLING WITH WHEN CONNECTING WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS. THIS BILL DOES NOT ENCOURAGE ALLOW LOCAL OFFICIALS TO DELIBERATE WITHOUT NOTICE ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT INSTEAD PROVIDE STRUCTURING CLARITY TO INTERACTIONS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY ALREADY HAPPENING ONLINE ROUTINE- INTERACTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO EXCLUDE SOCIAL MEDIA PARTICIPATION HARM CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. AND DOES A DISSERVICE TO THE PUBLIC WHILE UNDERMINING TRANSPARENCY. RIGHT NOW WE UNDERSTAND SOME CITY ATTORNEYS ARE SUGGESTING THAT THERE COUNCIL MEMBER STAY OFF A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPLETELY- BECAUSE OF THIS GRAY AREA OF LACK OF CLARITY ON THE BROWN ACT. MEMBERS AS MODERNIZE THE BROWN ACT FOR THE SOCIAL MEDIA ARAB I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN MISTER STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE WITH. SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN MATTEO BECAUSE I KNOW THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE I I'M GONNA SPORTS YOU TODAY BUT- THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF. AS I READ THE BILL. AS WE STEP TO PREVENT TO MAKE SURE THAT. COUNCIL MEMBERS BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OTHER LOCAL ACTORS CAN IN FACT. COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR CONSTITUENCIES ONLINE. THE WAY SOME OF THE EXEMPTIONS ARE PROVIDED IN THERE AND THE ONE THAT WORRIES ME THE MOST IS ABOUT THE DIGITAL ICONS. IF WE ARE SETTING UP THE POSSIBILITY. WHERE I COULD AS A LOCAL ELECTED POST SOMETHING. ON THE INTERNET ABOUT IT AND ITEM THAT I HAVE. AND THEN RELY ON THE LAKES FROM MY COLLEAGUES. WHICH MY READING THE BILL CURRENTLY SEEMS TO ALLOW. THEN THAT SHOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE BROWN ACT BECAUSE NOW I HAVE COLLECTED VOTES A LITTLE BIT SURREPTITIOUSLY. SOCIAL MEDIA-PLATFORMS ARE NOT UBIQUITOUS AND NOT ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE CONNECTED ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. SO IT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO SAY WE CHECK THAT BOX BECAUSE IT IS PUBLIC DISCOURSE IT IS NOT PUBLIC DISCOURSE EVEN IF IT IS A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM THAT IS FAIRLY COMMONLY USE. SO I THINK WE DO NEED TO MODERNIZE AROUND ACT WE NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR MINOR TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS HOWEVER. IF WE ARE ALLOWING EXEMPTIONS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF ACTIVITY WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WE ALLOW DON'T ALLOW SO THAT WE ARE NOT WHICH I KNOW HE'S NOT YOUR TENSION. OPENING DOORS FOR UNDER THE CAN'T COUNTER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN MEMBERS TO BUILD CONFIDENCE IN THE VOTE SAID THEY HAVE WITHOUT HAVING THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE AND BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THEIR CONSTITUENCIES SO THAT IS MY CONCERN. THANK YOU MISTER STONE. SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER MULLIN YOU MAY CLOSE. THEY CAME OUT OF SPEAKER I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CRUZ- EXPRESSING HIS CONCERNS HE BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION- IS THE LACK OF CLARITY IN THE LANGUAGE WITH REGARD TO ONE OF THE EXEMPTIONS- WHEN.

OF THE BROWN ACT PROVISIONS ARE APPLICABLE I COULDN'T I AM TOTALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING ONTHAT ISSUE WITH REGARD TO THAT SPECIFIC EXEMPTION. AND CLARIFYING THAT THAT IS THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO- WITH THIS BILL SO I THANK YOU. TO THE MEMBER FROM SANTA CRUZ RAISING THAT ISSUE I AM FULLY COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING ADDITIONAL LOT DEFINITIONAL- ISSUES WERE GOING TO BE. A HOPEFULLY ON THE SENATE SIDE OF TWEAKING THIS LANGUAGE. LET ME JUST SAY MEMBER SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS AYE BROTHER BY THEIR VERY NATURE PUBLIC. AND THE BROWN ACT MUCH OF THE INTENT BEHIND THE ORIGINAL BROWN ACT WAS TO MAKE SURE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE OUTSIDE OF PUBLIC VIEW SOCIAL MEDIA BY ITS VERY NATURE. ARE PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT- INTERACTIONS OUGHT COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE COME TO MY OFFICE AND OTHER LOCAL FFICIALS ASKING FOR ACTION AND CLARITY.

BUT EVERYONE OF THEM WAS LEFT AND DEEPLY AND EVERYONE OF THEM IS MESSED PROFOUNDLY. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MISSING THEM EVERYONE OF THEM. WITH A SUPERSTAR HERO AND ELECTIONS. IS KOBE BRYANT HIMSELF SAID THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO TRY AND INSPIRE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE GREAT AT WHATEVER THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. THE WE REMEMBER THEM MAY THEIR MEMORY BE AN INSPIRATION AND A BLESSING. THANK YOU IS PETRIE-NORRIS DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I'D TO RISE SO ON OF IN MEMORY OF KOBE BRYANT AND THOSE WHO WERE LOST WITH HIM THIS PAST SUNDAY. AS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I STAND TODAY PARTICULARLY IN MEMORY OF KOBE BRYANT. NOT FOR THE FIVE TIME WORLD CHAMPION WITH THE LAKERS OR THE TWO TIME OLYMPIC MEDALIST. AND THE OSCAR WINNER MOST RECENTLY. BUT FOR THE IN HIM BEING A DEDICATED FATHER A HUSBAND A LOT PHILANTHROPIST AND A STRONG MENTOR IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. I'M SURE ALL OF YOUR WHERE HIS COURT SUCCESS IN NOTHING STANDS OUT MORE HOWEVER THEN HIS MENTALITY FOR SUCCESS. HIS TRADEMARK WAS THE MONUMENTALITY WHICH COULD BE APPLIED TO EVERYONE'S LIFE. IN THIS MENTALITY IS DESCRIBED IN HIS OWN WORDS WHEN HE SAYS THE MINDSET IS AN ABOUT SEEKING A RESULT. IT'S MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS OF GETTING TO THAT RESULT. IT'S ABOUT THE JOURNEY AND THE APPROACH IT'S A LIFE. WE TALKED KOBE BRYANT BEGIN OF. IS PEIRCE VENTURES WITH AND FAMILY HE CO FOUNDED THE KOBE AND VANESSA BRYANT FAMILY FOUNDATION THE OFFICIAL AND HE WAS THE OFFICIAL AMBASSADOR FOR THE AFTER SCHOOL ALL STARS A CHAMPION FOR STAND UP TO CANCER PROVIDING MOTIVATIONAL MESSAGES TO THOSE BATTLING CANCER AND I HAS DONATED MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS TO THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE IN WASHINGTON DC. AS POINTED OUT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HE WAS THE FOR HE HE WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO WIN AN ACADEMY AWARD FOR BEST. ANIMATED SHORT FILM WHEN HE WROTE IN THEIR RATED DEAR BASKETBALL. HIS FAVORITE PART OF RETIRING WAS SPENDING TIME WITH HIS FAMILY AND BEING A MENTOR SHARING HIS KNOWLEDGE WITH OTHERS ABOUT THE GAME HE LOVED. THIS YOUNG MAN WAS MAKING SURE THAT HIS POST CAREER FOOTPRINT WAS JUST AS IMPACTFUL AS A FOOTPRINT HE LEFT ON THE COURT. YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. KOBE BRYANT AND HIS IMPACT UPON OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND TALKING WITH A YOUNG MAN HE SAID THERE WERE THREE THINGS HE WANTED TO DO IN LIFE. HE WANTED TO MEET OBAMA. HONOR TO MEET JZ. AND HE WANTED TO BE KOBE. THOSE ARE THE THREE THAT HE FELT WERE IMPACTFUL IN HIS LIFE AND I FOUND THAT TO BE QUITE INTERESTING. WHEN I SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT HAPPENS IN DEATH IS JUST A PART OF LIFE. AND ANY OF US WHO THINK IT'S NOT WE'LL FIND OUT FAIRLY SOON. THAT I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WHAT IS IN ME WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHERE IT'S ALL ABOUT. WE CAN MOURN. WE CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES WE CAN DO THOSE THINGS THAT THE HELP EASE THE PAIN BUT THE PAIN WILL BE THERE IF YOU'VE EVER LOST. A LOVED ONE IT WILL BE THERE AT ONLY TIME AND WORKING THROUGH IT WILL BASICALLY HELP YOU. WITH A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE LEARN IN THE PROCESS WHEN WE WHEN WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH DEATH. I'M REMINDED OFTENTIMES ABOUT METHUSELAH. THE BIBLE TELLS AS WITH LOSE A LIVE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE YEARS. AND THEN DIED. THAT'S ALL WE HAVE IS A RECORD OF HIM. NO ACTIVITY. NO CONTRIBUTIONS. WE KNOW WHOSE FATHER WAS WHOSE CHILDREN WERE. BUT HE LIVE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE YEARS ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURE. AND THEN DIED. AND I THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OF US WHO. WHO WILL ONLY LIVE THIRTY FORTY YEARS. AND YET THAT'S PERIOD IN BETWEEN BIRTH AND DEATH. IS FIELD. FEEL WITH THINGS THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED. FEEL WHAT HOW WE MAKE PEOPLE FEEL. FILLED AT THINGS OF WHAT THEY DID IN OUR LIFE AND HOW WE SAW THEM AND THE IMPACT OF THEIR LIFE. WILL LIVE FOR EVER AND EVER BECAUSE IF NOT WHAT THEY DID BUT HOW THEY MADE YOU FEEL AS A HUMAN BEING. AND HOW THEY HELP YOU TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS. WHEN I THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY SAYS. CALL WAS LIFE ISTOO SHORT IT WAS UNTIMELY. AND ALWAYS. THE THING HOLES OF. WE'RE NOT CHARGE OF THE CLOCK SOME ELSE'S INTO OF THE CLOCK SO WE CALL IT UNTIMELY IT'S MAYBE OUR TIME BUT IT'S NOT THE REAL TIME BECAUSE ALL OF US DIE AT OUR TIME. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WHILE WE GRIEVE ABOUT IT WE HAVE SO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO FIGHT FOR OUR DREAMS AS HE FOUGHT FOR HIS. WE DOING TO HELP OTHERS ACCOMPLISH DEIRDRE HE DID HOW WILL WE MAKE OUR LEGACY AN IMPORTANT LEGACY A LEGACY THAT'S ONLY FORTY ONE YEARS LONG AND YET MORE IMPACTFUL THAN SOMEONE WHO LIVED NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE YEARS. I WANT TO FEEL OF THE OTHER DAY OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS NINETY FOUR YEARS OLD. AND PEOPLE THEIR GRIEVED AS IF HE WERE FOURTEEN. BECAUSE HE STILL WORKED EVERY DAY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND HE HAD PROJECTS HE WAS WORKING ON ANY HAD THINGS HE WAS GIVING PEOPLE AND HE WAS SHARING HIS HISTORY OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN SAN DIEGO. AND SO WE GRIEVE FOR HIM AS IF HE WERE JUST A KID GETTING READY TO DO SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE I ALWAYS WAS READY AND GETTING READY TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. WE GRIEVE FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY BECAUSE WE KNOW NOT SO MUCH FOR HIM BUT HIS FAMILY. THE THING MESSED. HE WILL DANCE DOOR WEDDING. YOU WON'T WALKING DOWN I. THESE ARE THINGS THAT MANY OF US HAVE X. IN OUR LIFE NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE FAMOUS BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT BRING US JOY BUT AT PURPOSE TO I'LL HAVE AND GIVE US A FOCUS IN LOOKING AT WHAT WE NEED TO DO. RIGHT I THINK OF THE FACT THAT. THE THING I WOULD MISS IS THE SECOND CHAPTER OF HIS LIFE. WE ALSO THE FIRST CHAPTER THE SPORTS. AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE SECOND CHAPTER WOULD LOOK LIKE AND YET HE GAVE US SOME EXAMPLES IN MANY WAYS OF HOW HARD HE WOULD WORK TO ACCOMPLISH HIS STRINGS. AND A HEART HE WILL WORK TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. BUT HE ALSO GAVE US ANOTHER EXAMPLE MOST PEOPLE. THE MORNING BEFORE YOU GOT ON THE PLANE. AFTER HE WENT TO CHURCH AND HE PRAYED. AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF HE KNEW WHO WAS IN CONTROL OF THE UNIVERSE NOT KOBE BRYANT NOT THE HELICOPTER DRIVER BUT THE PERSON HE PRAYED TO. AND IT WAS HIS TIME IN MAY NOT OF BEEN HOURS BUT WAS HE IS AND THE MOST WE CAN TAKE FROM IT IS THAT ALL OF US USE EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY TO THOSE THINGS WE KNOW ALL RIGHT TO NEVER DID LATE THE STATEMENT THAT I LOVE YOU. NEVER PLAY THE IMPORTANCE OF FOLKS IN YOUR LIFE NEVER FORGET TO SAY THANK YOU. NEVER FORGET TO DO THOSE THINGS THAT THANK YOU WOULD DO IN THE FUTURE BUT YOU GO TO THEIR PRO TIME THIS IS THE TOP. THE TIME. IS TO. I ACTUALLY ASSET WITH A J. MEMBER OF KOBE. AND WE GIVE LAW AND TO FAMILY AND TO THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM AT THAT TIME BECAUSE I'M SURE TE LIFE WAS FULL. COMPLEX MANY THINGS AND IT WAS THEIR TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER IS KAMLAGER. YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO RISE TO ADJOURN IN THE MEMORY OF THE NINE VICTIMS THAT PERISHED IN THE FIRE AND TO SPEAK TO A LIFE OF KOBE BRYANT. AN ICON IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND BEYOND. MANY OF HIS PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITIES AND COMMUNITY VISITS LANDED HIM IN THE FIFTY FOURTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AS WELL AS MANY DISTRICTS ACROSS THE SOUTH WIND. KOBE BRYANT PERSONIFIED PASSION PRIDE AND PERSEVERANCE. EVEN WITH HIS GOD GIVEN EXTRAORDINARY TALENT HE OUT WORKED EVERY OPPONENT HE FACED. HAVING MASTERED THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF HIGH STAKES COMPETITIVE SPORT HE TRANSCENDED EVEN THAT. AND BUILT A TWO BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. HE CHAMPIONED GIRLS ATHLETICS AND PREDICTED THAT THE DAY WILL SOON BE WHEN A WOMAN PLAYS IN THE NBA. HE NEVER FALTERED CARRYING THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF A PRIVILEGED METROPOLIS. EVEN WHEN THE CITY BLANCHED AT HIM. HE EMBODIED AT ONCE EXTREME GREATNESS AND PROFOUND NORMALCY. RIPPLE SORRY IN PART J. REST IN PEACE BLACK MAMBA. THERE WAS KAMLAGER. SHE APRIL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO RISE TODAY TO REQUEST THAT WE ADJOURNED IN MEMORY OF KOBE BRYANT AND OF THE OTHER EIGHT VICTIMS OF THE TRAGIC HELICOPTER CRASH ON SUNDAY AND ONE- ECHO THE VERY ELOQUENT COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS TRAGIC LOSS WAS FELT VERY DEEPLY IN MY COMMUNITY. FOR MANY REASONS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH WAS THAT THE HELICOPTER CRASH OCCURRED IN CALABASAS IN MY DISTRICT. I IN THE HILLS JUST ACROSS FROM A RIGHT MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THE LAS VIRGENES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN FOR SO MANY IN THE WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AS ACROSS LOS ANGELES KOBE. BRYANT WAS SO MUCH MORE THAN BASKETBALL HE WAS THE LAKERS HE WAS THE NBA. AND HE WAS THE CHILDHOOD HERO FOR MANY IN OUR DISTRICT. IS ALSO A OP. LOSS FOR OUR STAFF- MY DISTRICT DIRECTOR KATHRYN CODDINGTON WHO IS VERY ABLY SERVED OUR COMMUNITY. SINCE I. TOOK OFFICE- WORKED FOR KOBE BRYANT FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS. ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS SHE WAS INVOLVED IN HIS MEDIA RELATIONS A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. AND SO THIS WAS A VERY PERSONAL LOSS FOR OUR EIGHTY FORTY FIVE FAMILY. AND WAS SPEAKING WITH HER LAST NIGHT OF REFLECTING ON HER EXPERIENCE AS IN THE- REALLY UP CLOSE AND UNVARNISHED VIEW THAT SHE GOT OF KOBE OVER THE TIME THAT SHE- WORKED WITH HIM. AND SHE HAD A NUMBER OF REFLECTIONS THAT AND THOUGHT WERE WORTH WHAT WAS JUST THE VIEW THAT SHE OF HIS TIRELESS WORK ETHIC IN HIS RELENTLESS DRIVE TO BE VAST EVERYTHING HE DID. FROM THE FOR OUR THIRD. PRE WORKOUT THAT HE COULD DO OUT LEAVING A LATE THE GAME. TO THE FACT THAT WE MISSED SHOT THE STAFF FOR THE GAME AND TAKE THAT SHOT OFF INTO FOR AN HOUR. FROM EXACT SAME SPOT. A IS. DID ON INCREDIBLE FOR THE GAME OF SHE SAID HAD NO DOUBT IN HER THAT IF YOU DIDN'T MAKE A IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN PAID HE WOULD'VE WORK JUST AS HARD TO PERFECT HIS GAME BECAUSE THAT WAS WHO HE WAS AND THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND SHE ALSO REFLECTED ON HIS VERY VERY SINCERE AND GENUINE COMMITMENT TO PHILANTHROPY I SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW HE WAS ONE OF THE TOP WHICH GRANTORS FOR THE MAKE A WISH STATION. TO HUNDRED FAMILIES DATING SO WHERE HE CAME INTO A RASH AND ALMOST ALMOST ALL THE WITHOUT. OUT NO. NOBODY KNEW. THIS WOULD BE-TAKING TIME AWAY FROM SCHEDULE WHERE EVERY MINUTE OF HIS LIFE WAS SCHEDULED TO GO IN SAID. OFTEN FOR LENGTHY PERIODS OF TIMES WITH CHILDREN WITH FAMILIES THAT WERE STRUGGLING THROUGH DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. NOT BECAUSE ANYBODY WOULD FIND OUT ABOUT IT NOT BECAUSE IT WOULD GET HIM GOOD PUBLICITY. BECAUSE HE FELT THAT THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING. HELLO SO I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHEN REMEMBER KOBE BRYANT. AND FOR ME ONE OF THE MEASURES OF HIS IMPACT IS HOW. AM IS HOW DEEPLY HIS LOSS WAS FELT BY SO MANY IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY REGARDLESS OF. AGE OR BACKGROUND OR INTEREST IN THE GAME OF BASKETBALL OR WHETHER YOU KNEW HIM OR NOT. THERE WAS JUST THIS PROFOUND REALLY SHARED SENSE OF LOSS. AMONG PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND ACROSS. LOS ANGELES IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE WORLD AND SO. AS WE REMEMBER THOSE VICTIMS REMEMBER KOBE BRYANT SOMEBODY WHO TRANSCENDS THE GAME. HE WILL BE DEEPLY MASTIN I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT WE ADJOURN IN HIS MEMORY TODAY- AND ALSO THE MEMORY OF JOHN A BRYANT. OF JOHN KERRY AND I'LL SO ALL FELLOW. OF COURSE. MOST SARAH AND PAIN CHEST.
