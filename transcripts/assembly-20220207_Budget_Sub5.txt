FOR THEIR VALUABLE INSIGHT AND ANALYSIS AND SUPPORT AND TEXT AFTER HELPING WITH LOGISTICS. OF A REMOTE HEARING. I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT JENNIFER CAMPER FOR CHALICE TIRELESS EFFORTS AS WELL- BEFORE I GO INTO ANY OF THE HEARINGS I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WANT TO MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS TODAY. OKAY THEN. WITH THAT I DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE BEING HERE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. OUR FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS A PANEL THAT INCLUDED IN OUR REVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD. AND THE VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS DISCUSSION IS TO HEAR ABOUT THE PROGRAM THAT WE- WHAT WE ARE DOING WELL HOW WE CAN IMPROVE SUPPORTING VICTIMS OF CRIME TO EASE TEIR AND THEIR FAMILIES BIRD IN THERE IN A DRAMATIC TIME IN THEIR LIVES. AS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT AND AGREEMENT WAS MADE TO CONSOLIDATE THE LEAST TO CONSOLIDATE THESE SERVICES. AND PROGRAMS SO THAT WE CAN BETTER SERVE VICTIMS. WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. AND I HOPE THAT TODAY'S DISCUSSION WILL GET US CLOSER TO ACHIEVING THEIR- THE GOALS OF THE AGREEMENT MADE ALMOST FOUR YEARS AGO. BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO SHARE A STORY. AND PART OF WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS ITEM ON TODAY'S AGENDA. A COUPLE MONTHS AGO I READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND- THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT SUCK OUT IN THAT ARTICLE TO ME BUT THERE WERE THERE WAS TO MOTHERS. WHO WERE IN THAT ARTICLE AND THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY SINCE HER SHOP WHEN I WAS PARALYZED IN THE OTHER WAS LEFT WITH SERIOUS INJURIES. WHAT MOTHERS ARE FORCED TO ORGANIZE THE GOAL FIND ME CAMPAIGN TO HELP GET THEIR MED- HELP WITH THEIR KIDS MEDICAL EXPENSES. WE'VE ALL EARD ABOUT OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS HAVING TO ORGANIZE SIMILAR CAMPAIGNS FOR FUNERAL COSTS BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR LOVED ONES. I DON'T KNOW ALL THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH- AND I DO WONDER IF THEY WERE AWARE OF THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM OR THE REASONS WHY THEY'RE QUALIFIED BUT MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE. OR OF THE RESEARCHERS WERE NOT ENOUGH- BUT IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT PARTICIPATING JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES. IF YOU TRY TO MAKE THE MUSCLE AS POSSIBLE AND HAVING TO RESORT TO A GO FUND ME CAMPAIGN- IS NOT WHERE WE WANT CALIFORNIA TO BE. AND SO. I DO THINK EVERYONE HAS DURING THIS FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO THE WORK- WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO HOPEFULLY. CREATE A BETTER PROGRAM- AND HAVE THAT KIND OF CONSOLIDATION WHICH- ALL FOR THE BETTER PROGRAM AS WELL. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE ONE MORE NOTE- THE PANELISTS ARE LISTED IN OR A SPEAKING ORDER BUT I DO HAVE ONE PANELIST DR GINA CASTRO RODRIGUEZ THAT WILL NEED TO LEAVE AT THE THIRTY. WE WILL HEAR FROM ALL OF OUR PANELISTS. AND THEN RETURNED TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. UNTIL WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PANELIST. WE HAVE A SPEAKERS READING. WE CAN DO WE HAVE LINDA GLEDHILL EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR CAL VCB READY TO SPEAK. WHEN THEY'RE WALKING THE FLOOR IS YOURS. LINDA HOLD ON WE STILL CAN'T HEAR YOU. ARE YOU MEET AT BY ANY CHANCE ON YOUR END. NO WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HERE IN THE ROOM. THE. THEN THEY GO AHEAD. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH- EVERY DAY IS AN ADVENTURE IN THIS ONLINE WORLD SO. YEAH THANK YOU CHAIRED A SIERRA AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING TODAY MY NAME IS LINDA BLOOD ON THE DOCKING OF OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE DO ACTUALLY SEE B. AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE JUST OVER TWO YEARS AGO. PRIOR TO THIS POSITION I WAS AT THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. I ALSO HAVE WORKED IN THE STATE SENATE AND I WAS A REPORTER FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE. SINCE COMING OUT OF THE C. B. I HAVE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR OPERATIONS BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SERVE VICTIMS BETTER AND SO INTERNALLY I FOCUSED ON BUILDING A STRONG MANAGEMENT TEAM AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT OUR CHECK THAT TECHNICAL SECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE WAS UP TO DATE. AND EXTERNALLY I REALLY ASSESS THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS AND HOW WE MAY BETTER SERVE THEM. AND I'M PROUD OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE INCLUDING A SHARP DECREASE IN APPLICATION PROCESSING TIME BUT NO THERE REMAINS MUCH MORE TO DO. I'VE ALSO WORKED ON IMPLEMENTING CHIU IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION ONE OF WHICH COMPENSATES VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR INCOME LOSS. AND THE OTHER WHICH PAYS VICTIMS OF STATE SPONSORED STERILIZATION. I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT BOTH OF THESE A LITTLE LATER. TO BEGIN I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE HISTORY AND PURPOSE OF TRAVESTY BE. HAVING TO BE WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND IT WAS THE FIRST PROGRAM OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION. IN MY TIME HERE AT. B. C. B. I'VE LEARNED FIRSTHAND THE VITAL WORK THAT WE DO TO ASSIST THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS OF CRIME EACH YEAR. HELPING THEM RECOVER FROM TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE THIS POSITION AND I TAKE SERIOUSLY MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THOSE WHO NEED OUR SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE MIGHT BE HURT BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE. SEXUAL AND PHYSICAL ASSAULT. HOMICIDE HUMAN TRAFFICKING ROBBERY. VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER AMONG OTHER CRIMES. VICTIMS WHO SUFFERED PHYSICAL INJURY THREAT OF PHYSICAL INJURY OR EMOTIONAL INJURY AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THESE CRIMES MAY QUALIFY FOR ASSISTANCE THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS MAY ALSO QUALIFY. TELEVISI BT PROVIDES UP TO SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES AS A PAIR OF LAST RESORT. TO COVER COSTS CREATED BY THE FRONT. THESE INCLUDE MEDICAL AND DENTAL CARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES INCOME LOSS FUNERAL EXPENSES RELOCATION COSTS AND RESIDENTIAL SECURITY. THERE OF LAST RESORT MEANS THE COMPANY SHOULD BE CAN ONLY PET FENCES AFTER OTHER AVAILABLE SOURCES A PAYMENT HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO A BILL. THE SOURCES INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO HEALTH INSURANCE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MEDICARE AND MEDICARE. THE BENEFITS WOULD PROVIDE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR RECEIVING THEM OF COURSE THAT OUT AND STATURE. STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ARE IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL CATEGORIES. RELOCATION FUNERAL BURIAL EXPENSES AND CRIME SCENE CLEANUP ARE THERE IS MOST UNDER FUNDED BASED ON STATISTICS AND FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY. THE MAXIMUM BENEFITS IN THESE ERRORS WERE SET BY STATUTE IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED SINCE WHICH IS WHY WE ARE REQUESTING INCREASES THIS YEAR. ORGANIZATION LAID COVEY C. B. FALLS UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. WE'RE GOVERNED BY A THREE MEMBER BOARD THAT MEETS ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS. THE BOARD IS CHAIRED BY THE SECRETARY BELLHOPS AND ALSO INCLUDES THE CONTROLLER AND A NUMBER APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. THAT NUMBER IS CURRENTLY CONTRA COSTA DISTRICT ATTORNEY DIANA PATRONS. LAST FISCAL YEAR COPIES TO BE RECEIVED MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS AND PAID FIFTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS. THE TOP THREE TYPES OF CRIME RECEIVED APPLICATIONS FOR WORK ASSAULT. CHILD ABUSE AND HOMICIDE. AND THE TOP TOP THREE EXPENSES THAT WE COVERED FOR MENTAL HEALTH FUNERAL BURIAL AND INCOME LOSS OF WORK. THESE ARE SERIOUS CRIMES WAS SERIOUS IMPACTS IN THE STAFFORDSHIRE BCB ARE DEDICATED TO HELPING EVERY PERSON WE POSSIBLY CAN. WE KNOW THE IMPACT OF CRIME CAN BE FAR REACHING AND LONG LASTING AND WE DO ALL WE CAN WITHIN OUR STATUTORY FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE THE HELP THAT THE VICTIMS NEED. THEIR DIVISIONAL STATISTICS ABOUT OUR PROGRAM IN YOUR AGENDA PAPERS AND WE PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT. SUMMARIZING ART ACTIVITIES ENERGY DATA FROM THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR. I PROVIDED COPIES TO THE TWENTY AND THAT REPORT IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ON OUR WEBSITE. IN ADDITION TO THE CORE MISSION OF COMPENSATING VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME HEALTH NEEDS TO BE RUN SEVERAL OTHER PROGRAMS TO HELP VICTIMS. WOULD COMPENSATE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY CONVICTED OF A CRIME AND SPENT TIME IN PRISON. IT'S CASES ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS PENAL CODE SECTION FORTY NINE HUNDRED CASES. CURRENTLY ONE CALL THE C. B. APPROVES A CLAIM IT GOES TO THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE THE CLAIM TO BE PAID. ALSO CAN TAKE MANY MONTHS BETWEEN THE TIME THE CLAIM IS APPROVED BY THE BOARD THE BILL PASSES THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PAYMENTS MADE TO THE VICTIM. IN AN EFFORT TO EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES APPROPRIATING SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND CHAO B. C. B. AND THAT WE ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING STATUTORY CHANGES WOULD ALLOW COPIES TO BE TO PAY THE CLAIM DIRECTLY. B. C. B. ALSO PROVIDES GRANTS TO CROMER TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS BETTER KNOWN AS TRC'S ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP VICTIMS OF CRIME. SHARE SEIZE PROVIDE TRAUMA INFORMED EVIDENCE BASED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO CRIME VICTIMS WHO MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR VETERANS COMPENSATION OR MAYBE FAIR OF REPORTING CRIMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. HAVE A SEAT CURRENTLY FUNDS EIGHTEEN TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS THROUGH GRANT AGREEMENTS WITH THEM SURE THAT THEY MEET STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TREATMENT TEAM SIR VICTIMS OF ALL TYPES OF VIOLENT CRIME AND TREAT CLIENTS WITH COMPLEX PROBLEMS REGARDLESS OF THEIR EMOTIONAL OR BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. WCB ALSO SUPPORTS VICTIMS OF MASS VIOLENCE EVENTS SUCH AS THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTING THE GOVERNOR LET FESTIVAL AND MOST RECENTLY THE SAN JOSE VGA SHOOTING THAT OCCURRED LAST MET HELP VICTIMS BEGIN TO RECOVER FROM THE TRAUMA THAT THEY HAVE ENTERED AND HELP THEM MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES. IN ADDITION TO DIRECT VICTIMS OF CRIME WE COVER WHAT WE CALL DERIVATIVE VICTIMS. DRIVEN THE VICTIMS OR SURVIVORS OF CRIME VICTIMS WHO HAVE DIED. PERSONS ARE LEGALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE VICTIM FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND MEMBERS OF THE VICTIMS FAMILIES THIS CAN INCLUDE PARENTS GRANDPARENTS SIBLINGS SPOUSES CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN. TELL ME CITY IS FUNDED THROUGH RESTITUTION FINES AND PENALTY ASSESSMENTS LET ME KNOW FIRST AND CONVICTED OF CRIMES AND TRAFFIC OFFENSES AND RESTITUTION ORDERS. OBVIOUSLY THESE MAIN FUNDING SOURCES OF THE RESTITUTION FUND AND FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS. THE FEDERAL VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT KNOWN AS VOTER REIMBURSES WRITTEN THE RESTITUTION FUND 475% THE VICTIM CLAIM PAYMENTS MADE FOR STATE FUNDS. THIS IS AN INCREASE FROM PRESIDENT FINDS AND THE VOTER FITS THAT IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AS SUCH WE ARE REQUESTING AN INCREASE DROP FEDERAL PREPARATION THIRTY TO ACCOMMODATE THIS CHANGE ENABLE US TO PASS THE REIMBURSEMENT ONTO THE RESTITUTION FUND. IT IS A KEY SOURCE REVENUE SOURCE FOR THE RESTITUTION FUND WAS RE DIRECTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO COUNTY CITY HAS NEEDED INCREASING SUPPORT FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TREMAIN SOLVENT ENABLE US TO CONTINUE TO HELP VICTIMS. THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET PROVIDES THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR RESTITUTION FUND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE RESTITUTION ON. AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING ONE THING I'VE WORKED HARD TO DO A TRAVESTY IS IMPROVE OUR EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A WORKLOAD TRACTOR WE WERE ABLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT PROCESSES WERE SLOWING US DOWN AND CREATE NEW PROCESSES TO MOVE APPLICATIONS MORE EFFECTIVELY. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE NOW PROCESS APPLICATIONS 40% FASTER THAN WE DID TWO YEARS AGO. THE AVERAGE APPLICATION CURRENTLY TAKES US THIRTY TWO DAYS TO PROCESS WE STRIVE EVERY DAY TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THAT NUMBER APPLICANT WAITS TO HEAR FROM US IS A DATE THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED TO RECOVER FROM THE CRIME THAT THEY EXPERIENCED. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FOCUS FOR ME WAS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR VETERANS TO UNDERSTAND OUR PROGRAM AND SUBMIT AN APPLICATION. WE OVERHAULED OUR WEBSITE LAST SPRING TO MAKE IT SIMPLE EASY TO USE AND VICTIM CENTER. WE DID THIS BY CLEARLY LAYING OUT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND THE APPLICATION PROCESS. THE WEBSITE ALSO HAS THE LOOK AND FEEL THAT IS PURPOSELY DESIGNED NOT TO LOOK LIKE A GOVERNMENT WEBSITE AND IT INCLUDES A QUICK ESCAPE AND TO HELP VICTIMS. CALIFORNIA HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF SUPPORTING VICTIMS AND OVER THE YEARS PROBABLY SEE THESE MEASUREMENTS BROWN. UNDER LEGISLATION ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING- ENTITLED UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR TWO YEARS FOR INCOME LOST. UNDER THIS LAW SO FAR WE HAVE PAID TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY VICTIMS. AND THIS PAST SUMMER THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE FORCED OR INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION COMPENSATION PROGRAM TO PAY VICTIMS OF STATE SPONSORED FOR STERILIZATION. WE LAUNCH THAT PROGRAM ON JULY FIRST I'M SORRY JANUARY FIRST AND THE VICTIMS HAVE UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO APPLY. THERE IS FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN REPARATIONS TO SPLIT EVENLY AMONG ALL ELIGIBLE CLAIMANTS TO APPLY. CAMPISI BE CONTINUES TO WORK TO EXPAND ITS NOT WORKING BY WITH MEETING WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE VICTIM SERVICE PROVIDERS ADVOCATES COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS COURT OFFICIALS AS WELL AS OUR STATE COLLEGE. WE REESTABLISHED A VICTIM ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE A FORUM FOR VICTIM SERVICE TAKE ORDERS TO ADDRESS COMMON PROBLEMS SUCH AS HOW TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES CREATED BY THE CAN DOWN. AND WHILE THEY'RE ON THE ADVISER TOO MANY PROBABLY TO BE ALSO MEET SEPARATELY WITH GROUPS SUCH AS CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND THE AND THAT'S THE- INNOCENCE PROJECT. TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS FOR DISTRUST LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. WELL ALL FIFTY STATES HAVE NOW ESTABLISHED A VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM CALIFORNIANS IS THE MOST ROBUST IN TERMS OF THE SERVICE WE PROVIDE TO VICTIMS AND THE MOST COMPLEX IN TERMS OF OUR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON HELPING VICTIMS OF CRIME RECOVERED FROM THE PAIN AND INJURIES CAUSED BY VIOLENT CRIME. OR IN THE CASE OF THOSE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED OR SUBJECT TO GOOD FOR STERILIZATION OF A GRAVE INJUSTICE. I TRAVESTY BE WE ARE DRIVEN BY THIS IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL MISSION THAT EACH YEAR HELPS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS OVERCOME DRAMATIC PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I THINK IT'S A THIRTY MINUTE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF FOR OUR PANELISTS. DO WE HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE- NEXT. READ AND SHARE MEMBERS CHOOSE SORT OF MORE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WILL BE FILLING IN FOR JESSICA PETERS TODAY- I WAS NOTED EARLIER IN THEIR HEARING AS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN OF TWENTY BUDGET AGREEMENT THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE AGREED IN CONCEPT TO CONSOLIDATE THE VICTIM SERVICE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY OPERATED BY CAL B. C. B. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. INTO A NEW VICTIM SERVICES DEPARTMENT UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY CONSOLIDATION WAS DEFERRED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN ORDER TO GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION TIME TO. COME UP WITH A DETAILED PLAN ABOUT SPECIFICALLY HOW TO CARRY OUT THE CONSOLIDATION. HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION DECLINED TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET CITING THE ONSET OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE RESULTING WORKLOAD FOR- WE ASK AS BEING A BARRIER TO DOING SO WE WOULD NOTE HOWEVER THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DID SUBMIT AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PACKAGE A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE- YESS RESPONSIBILITIES. BY CONSOLIDATING THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION UNDER ITS PURVIEW. DEGREE NEED TO CONSOLIDATE THE PROGRAM UNDER THESE PROGRAMS UNDER NEW DEPARTMENT WAS THE RESULT OF MULTIPLE YEARS OF INTEREST FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND MAKING A CHANGE. FOR EXAMPLE A TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT FILED BY OUR OFFICE RECOMMENDED CONSOLIDATING VICTIMS PROGRAMS INTO A SINGLE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE WE IDENTIFIED VARIOUS WEAKNESSES IN THE EXISTING SYSTEMS SPECIFICALLY WE NOTED THAT THERE IS A LACK OF COORDINATION BETWEEN- YES THE BECOMES COMPENSATION BOARD. THAT THE STATE COULD BE MISSING OUT ON OPPORTUNITIES TO DRAW DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS. AND THAT UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM IN WHICH THERE'S NUMEROUS DUPLICATE OF SMALL GRANTS THAT ARE NARROWLY TARGETED. IT REDUCES THE EFFICIENCY AND POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE'S OVERALL ATTEMPT TO SUPPORT VICTIMS PROGRAMS. THESE CONCERNS THAT WE BROUGHT UP IN TWENTY FIFTEEN GENERALLY CONTINUE TO APPLY GIVEN THESE CONCERNS AND THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION. OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHAT ITS PLANS ARE TO COME FORWARD WITH A DETAILED PROPOSAL TO CONSOLIDATE THE VICTIMS PROGRAMS CURRENTLY OPERATED BY- YES. AND THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD INTO A NEW CONSOLIDATED. DEPARTMENT THANK YOU. THANK OU NEXT WE HAVE. TINASHE HOLLAND'S CALIFORNIA AND FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. AFTERNOON CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY MY NAME IS TO MEET TOLERANCE I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE I'M ALSO THE FORMER STATE DIRECTOR OF CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE WHICH IS OUR NETWORK OF CRIME SURVIVORS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WELL THE LARGEST MEMBERSHIP WITH OVER TWELVE THOUSAND MEMBERS pTHROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE I AM GRATEFUL FOR THIS CONVERSATION I'D LIKE TO COMMEND CAL B. C. B. S. SPECIFICALLY DIRECTOR CLINT HILL FOR ALL THE WORK AND AS SUPPORT SHE'S OFFERED TO CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR OFFICES OFTENTIMES THEY CAN THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH DOCTOR BACILLARY- IN UNICAST RODRIGUEZ AND OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THE ISSUES. OF THE CONTENTS. OF IRIZARRY DRESSED HERE IN THE STATE- THERE COUPLE THINGS I WON OFFERINGS. OF THE PERSPECTIVE AROUND CHALLENGES FOR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I AND MANY OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN NOTED BY DIRECTOR CLAY HILL AND I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS- AROUND THE CHANGES THAT ARE WORKING TO BE MADE- IN DESPITE. ALL OF OUR EFFORTS IT IS THAT THERE'S A VERY REAL WHO NEED FOR US TO CONTINUE PRIORITIZING. VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS AND REMOVE- CHALLENGES TO GETTING ACCESS TO THE SUPPORT THAT WE ALL NEED AND DESERVE. I HAVE A CRIME SURVIVORS SOME OF WHOSE BEEN INTEGRATED DRIVEN IT BIG TIME- BY LOSING TO AND THERE'S A NON VIOLENCE IN MY HOME TOWN OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND UNFORTUNATELY EXPERIENCING OTHER VICTIM EXPERIENCES I KNOW FIRST HAND- THE BARRIERS THAT WE HAVE FACED. AND THE COUNTERS THAT WE HAVE TO ACCESSING IMMEDIATE SUPPORT. OF WIND THERE IS A THAT INCIDENT THAT AFFECTS. US ALL IN OUR FAMILIES. DESPITE THESE. INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT BEEN DIRECTED. TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE SPENDING OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES. THE MAJORITY OF SURVIVORS THAT ARE ST STILL ARE STRUGGLING TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO. RECOVER FROM HARM. IN THE STATE SPENDING ON DEFENSE SERVICES. REPRESENTS ABOUT 1% OF WHAT THE STATE SPENDS ON THE PRISON SYSTEM AND THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. IN OTHER WORDS CALIFORNIA SPENDS NEARLY EIGHTY TIMES MORE. ON THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM CORPORATION IT DOES FOR VICTIMS. OF CRIME. AND EVEN WITH MILLION. RESIDENTS IMPACTED BY VIOLENCE EVERY YEAR THE STATE WE KNOW CAN DO MORE AND IS WORKING TO DO MORE TO SCALE UP. AN ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS THAT EXIST IN TO INTEGRATE SURVIVOR VOICES AND LEADERSHIP INTO POLICY MAKING- ENERGY PRESSING BARRIERS THAT MAKE IT HARD FOR US TO GET THE SUPPORT IN FACT. A TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY OF CALIFORNIA CRIME SURVIVORS FOUND THAT FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE VICTIMS ACTUALLY RECEIVED ANY MEDICAL FINANCIAL OR MENTAL HEALTH. SUPPORT ALONG WITH THE OTHER HEALING SERVICES TO HELP THEM RECOVER. DESPITE MAJORITY- THAT ARE WAITING TO GET ACCESS TO THE SERVICES. AND AGAIN ALL KNOWLEDGE IN THAT ARE BECOME COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND SAY IN CALIFORNIA IS A- NATIONAL LEADER- THE SURVIVAL OF THE SURVIVORS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION ARE STILL FACING VERY SIGNIFICANT HURDLES. TO ACCESSING IT THERE ARE STILL THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS THAT ARE DENIED EVERY YEAR AND IS A RECENT ANALYSIS THAT FOUND THAT THE TYPES OF COMPENSATION ELIGIBILITY RESTRICTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. INCLUDING CONVICTION BASED RESTRICTIONS DENIALS FOR ALLEGED LACK OF COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT RESTRICTIONS BASED ON A POLITICAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE VICTIMIZATION. ARE INHERENTLY AND SYSTEMICALLY RACIST AND THEY pRELY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT OPINION WHICH OF COURSE. BECAUSE OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE I DIDN'T ALLEN COMPENSATION FOR BACK FOR BLACK VICTIMS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE WAY DIFFICULT COM. PROGRAM IS FUNDED IS ALSO NOT SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TERM THE RESTITUTION FROM THE PROVIDES THE MAJORITY OF FUNDING FOR VICTIMS COMPENSATION. HAS IN RECENT YEARS IT MORE THAN IT IS TAKING IN THE STATE HAS BACK FLLED SOME OF THIS LOSS WITH GENERAL FUNDS AND HAS NOT- RETHOUGHT THE OVERALL MODEL FOR AND- WE DO APPLY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR SUPPORTING AN ONGOING THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION TO THE RESTITUTION FINE WE KNOW THE CALIFORNIA MUST COMMIT FULLY TO FUNNY THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM IN GENERAL FUND DOLLRS AND THIS FINE CURRENTLY RELIES ON REVENUE. FROM CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS FINES AND FEES IT'S INHERENTLY UNSTABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. OWNERS FINDING FEES ALSO TRACK PEOPLE IN THE JUSTICES. AND CYCLES OF IMPOSSIBLE DEBT FRUSTRATE INABILITY TO MOVE PAST THE CONVICTION DOES VERY LITTLE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IT ACTUALLY PUTS SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS IT MORE HARD. CONTINUE TO RELY THE SYSTEM IS COUNTER TO CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AND I KNOW IT'S ALSO COUNTER TO WHAT. MANY FOLKS WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY- ARE ALIGNED WITH IN WANT TO SEE MORE HAPPEN TO KEEP SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS STATE AT SAFE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPROACH THAT REALLY REQUIRES US TO EXPAND VICTIM SERVICES ELIGIBILITY TO ALL VICTIMS OF CRIME. AN ALL CRIME EXPERIENCES. THE EXCLUSION. THAT WE HAVE TO ACCESS VICTIM SERVICES. SHUT OUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED I'M PROVIDE BY VIOLENT CRIME IN DISPROPORTIONATELY AGAINST BLACK VICTIMS AND VICTIMS FROM COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SEVERELY IMPACTED BY CRIME. WHILE THESE WHILE THERE ARE BENEFITS- IN PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS. SUCH AS VICTIMS COMPENSATION VICTIM SERVICES AND SOME PROTECTIONS AGAINST THE BIXEL. OUR JOB LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM VICTIMIZATION THOSE BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS ARE STILL NOT READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL VICTIMS OF CRIME. CALIFORNIA HAS TO IN THE DISCRIMINATOR DISCRIMINATORY. RULES AND PRACTICES THAT TREAT VICTIMS DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR DEPENDING STATUS OR DEMOGRAPHICS. AND EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY TO SERVICES AND COMPENSATION TO ALL VICTIMS EXPLICITLY AFFIRMING PROTECTIONS TO ALL VICTIMS IS CRUCIAL TO HEALING. INTO STOPPING THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS INCLUDES ANY EXCLUSIONS THAT BLAME VICTIMS FOR THEIR OWN VICTIMIZATION. PREVENT ELIGIBILITY- IN EXTENDING ELIGIBILITY BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS TO FOLKS WHO WITNESS VIOLENCE. DRIVEN IF FAMILY MEMBERS. OF A VIOLENT CRIME. IN PEOPLE WITH PRIOR RECORDS- MAY. BE IN A PROBATION OR PAROLE- IN VICTIMS POLICE. I ELIGIBILITY ALSO NOT PLEASE REFER OF WHEN TYPE OF DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE AND SO WE WANT TO MOVE TOWARD OF THE NEW CHANGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. IN DISPENSARY IS. AND REDUCE BIGGEST DIFFICULT CONVERSATION WANT TO STABILIZE FUNDING WE WANT TO PROVIDE A LOCAL ARTIST FLEXIBLE CASH ASSISTANCE IN VERY QUICKLY TO SURVIVORS IN THIS IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE SAFETY THAT OUR DOLLARS ARE NOT ONLY READILY ACCESSIBLE BUT THAT THEY ARE FLEXIBLE. IT IS AN INDEPENDENT- EXPERIENCE FOR VICTIMS TO BE HARMED AND EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS VERY SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT UNFORTUNATELY OUR CURRENT SYSTEM DOESN'T OFTEN SUPPORT OF THE OPPORTUNITY. KIND OF THEY NEED IN THE MOMENT WHEN THEY REALLY FLEXIBILITY CASH ASSISTANCE TO SURVIVORS IS A CRITICAL PART. OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR STATE AND OUR SURVIVORS WHO WITH THE NEED- THAT INCLUDES DIRECT CASH ASSISTANCE. AND MADE READILY AVAILABLE THROUGH TRUSTED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE DON'T WANT SURVIVORS TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE- THE PROMISES THAT THE ADDITIONAL TRAUMA- IN SYSTEMIC BARRIERS OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH A LOCAL AGENCIES WHEN THEY CAN GET ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES AND SERVICES DIRECTLY FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH IN THEIR COMMUNITY. WERE ABLE TO SHOW UP AND CONTINUE SUPPORTING THEM AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE HEALING PROCESS AND RECOVER IN THEIR LIVES AND SO WE'RE REALLY CALLING FOR. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES GRANTS TO TRUST A COMMUNITY BASED IN SURVIVOR LED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ROOTED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AUTHORIZING THESE GRANTEES TO SUB GRANT AND DIRECTLY- PROVIDE CASH THE CASH SUPPORT TO VICTIMS. TRAUMATIZE AN ENDANGERED WITNESSES AND THEIR LOVED ONES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM ALSO LIMITS ANY BURDENSOME PAPERWORK TO MAKE SURE THAT- URGENTLY THE RESOURCES CAN BE MOVED TO SURVIVORS WITH VERY MINIMAL RED TAPE. WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND BUILD ON THE TRUMP RECOVERY SANTA MONICA SINGER MODEL- STATEWIDE. SINCE THAT WE MENTIONED BEFORE- OF. THE CHALLENGES- DID THE BARRIERS TO SAFETY THEY OFTENTIMES THIS PROVIDES OR CREATES FOR SURVIVORS ESPECIALLY BLOCK LIKE BECOMES AND SURVIVORS AND FOLKS WHAT IMPACT THE COMMNITY ONE INCENTIVIZE LOCAL JURY POSITION TO CREATE COMMUNITY BASED CULTURALLY COMPETENT TRUMP'S AMERICA EVERY CENTERS FOR MARGINALIZED VICTIMS I WANT TO CONTINUE TO REMOVE BARRIERS FOR HOUSING ADJUSTABILITY AND ENSURE LEGAL PROTECTION SO THAT ARE SPIDERS DO NOT CONTINUE TO ENDANGER THEMSELVES BY LOSING. THEIR STABILITY FOR THE SAKE OF MOVING TOWARDS SAFETY SUBJECT THANK YOU FOR THE TIME- TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON THE PRIORITIES THAT WE ALL AS SURVIVORS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. LIKE TO SEE THE STATE PRIORITIZE. THANK YOU MISS HOLLAND'S NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR GINA CASTRO RODRIGUEZ. ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. THANK YOU A CHAIR GARCIA AND THANK YOU TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I AM AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN THE GRADUATE COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT BUT I ALSO HAVE THIRTY YEARS OF WORK IN THE COMMUNITY ON VICTIM AND SURVIVOR ISSUES MOST RECENTLY I WAS THE CHIEF OF THE SERVICES IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR SEVEN YEARS BEFORE LEAVING- LAST SPRING. I COME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AND THE NEED FOR SUPPORT IN HEALING AND RECOVERY- APPRECIATE THE- REPORT BY- SQUAD HILL AND- ALL THE WORK THAT CAL BCB HAS DONE. TO IMPROVE- TIMES YOU KNOW THAT THE TIME IT TAKES TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION AND IMPROVING THE RATE OF DENIALS- BUT WE STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO HELP SURVIVORS HEAL AND RECOVER. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH WITH SURVIVORS OF CRIME AND HEARING DIRECTLY FROM THEM ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. ENGAGING THEM WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ACCESSING RESOURCES TO HEALING AND RECOVERY WE'VE A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING. OUT IN THE FIELD WITH SURVIVORS AND HOW THEY'RE ENGAGING WITH THE SYSTEMS WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND WHAT THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AND I'LL SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE TODAY. THE FIRST MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE FOCUS ON HEALING AND RECOVERY. WHEN PEOPLE DON'T FEEL AND RECOVER FROM TRAUMA FROM VIOLENCE FROM CRIME THERE ARE MORE AT RISK FOR ADDITIONAL VICTIMIZATION BEING A CRIME VICTIM IN OTHER CASES. THERE ARE MORE AT RISK FOR COMMITTING VIOLENT ACTS THEMSELVES. AND THEY REALLY DON'T RECOVER FROM THE INCIDENT AND INSTEAD THEY ARE BURIED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PREVENT THEM FROM FULLY ENGAGING AGAIN IN RELATIONSHIPS. IN SOCIETY AND IN MOVING FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES SO IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY HAVE WITH CALIFORNIA VICTIMS COMPENSATION. DOESN'T MEET THE NEEDS OF A LOT OF SURVIVORS SO WE KNOW THAT WITH ALL OF THE APPLICATIONS OF THE AND THE DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN PAID OUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'RE STILL OVER ONLY AVERAGING A LITTLE OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS A PERSON. ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE. DOLLARS AVERAGE. THAT ALL OF THE FUNDING REALLY DOESN'T START TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS IN THEIR RECOVERY AFTER CRIME VICTIMIZATION WE ALSO KNOW THAT LESS THAN 1% OF THE SURVIVORS APPLY FOR COMPENSATION EVER COME CLOSE TO THE SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR MAX- THAT NUMBER IS OFTEN USED TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO EXPAND SERVICES INVICTA POP STATION EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A REALISTIC NUMBER TO MEASURE. CHANGE AGAINST. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES IS RAISING THE CAPS ON THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN WHICH CRIME SURVIVORS CAN APPLY FOR WE COMPLETELY SUPPORT- IS QUITE HELD IN THE- THE PROPOSED RAISE ENOUGH CAPS PARTICULARLY FOR THINGS LIKE WE LOCATION. WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN A CRIME SURVIVOR IS NOT SAFE IN THEIR OWN HOME ANYMORE AND THEY NEED TO MOVE AND THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP DOESN'T GO VERY FAR IN CALIFORNIA. WE SUPPORT THAT OUR RECOMMENDATION AND ALSO FOR FUNERAL BURIAL THE AMOUNT OF SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH THE INCREASED INFLATION AROUND FUNERAL AND BURIAL AND IT DOES. LEAVE MANY SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS TO HAVE TO RAISE MONEY ON THEIR OWN TO BURY THEIR LOVED ONE WHILE THEY'RE STILL IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRAUMA AND GRIEF AND LOSS SO WE SUPPORT THOSE THINGS. WE DO THINK THOUGH THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THE THAT WE SHOULD THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT WHO ARE SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS OF CRIME. THERE ARE SO MANY SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE AND GUN VIOLENCE IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR VICTIMS COMPENSATION- WE NEED TO ALSO BROUGHT IN AS TO NEEDS HOLLAND SAID. THE IDEA OF WHO CAN RECEIVE COMPENSATION WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE. MIRED IN THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THEY HAVE BOTH EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE AND COMMITTED VIOLENCE THEY LIVE IN FAMILIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE VIOLENCE IS COMMON AND THE REPLICATION OF THAT VIOLENCE IS ACTUALLY HARMFUL TO THE INDIVIDUAL IT'S HARMFUL TO THE FAMILY. IT'S HARD FOR THE COMMUNITY AT THE MELANIE IT'S HARMFUL TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY YEAH I DIDN'T OUT IN SOCIETY AND SO TREATING VIOLENCE IS A FOUNDATIONAL MECHANISM FOR ENDING VIOLENCE AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THAT WAY. AND THE RESOURCES NEED TO BE DIRECTED IN THAT WAY IN ORDER FOR US. TO HAVE MORE SAFETY FOR PEOPLE. I'M ONE OF THE STUDY'S THAT I DIDN'T. YEAR WE ASK SURVIVORS OUT HOW THEY FELT ABOUT IN. BROADENING THE DEFINITION OF VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS TO INCLUDE MORE PEOPLE WHO HAD ACCESS TO RESOURCES- THERE WAS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THIS IDEA INCLUDING SEVENTY THREE PERCENT. IN 73% ENDORSED SUPPORTING SURVIVORS OF POLICE VIOLENCE AND 53% INDOOR SUPPORTING SURVIVORS WHO HAD HISTORIES OF PROBATION OR PAROLE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WITH PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW ARE ARE ENGAGED IN AFFECTED BY AND VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE SO THAT WE PREVENT FUTURE VIOLENCE- ANOTHER FINDING FROM THE STUDY IS THAT. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF REACH YOUR INFORMATION ABOUT THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM. IN THE STUDY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING CALLED SURVIVOR VOICES WHICH WILL BE RELEASED SOMETIME AT THE END OF THIS MONTH OR THE BEGINNING OF MARCH 60% OF THOSE POLLED SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT OFFERED COMPENSATION. OF THE OF THE PEOPLE WERE OFFERED COMPENSATION THOUGH 89% OF THEM APPLIED SO WHEN THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM THEY APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM. AND OF THOSE 89% THAT APPLIED 93% RECEIVED COMPENSATION SO WE KNOW THAT THE COMPENSATION IS VALUABLE IN THAT IT HELPS PEOPLE BUT WE NEED THE INFORMATION TO BE OUT THERE FOR THEM. AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW HOW THEY QUALIFY FOR IT AND WHAT THEY CAN USE IT FOR- UNFORTUNATELY 70% OF THOSE WHO DID NOT GET. COMPENSATION NEVER LEARNED WHY THEY DIDN'T GET COMPENSATION. SO THEY'RE LEFT BEING LET DOWN BY A SYSTEM THAT THEY APPLY TO FOR SUPPORT AND DIDN'T GET ANY A GOOD INFORMATION OR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THEY DIDN'T GET THAT SUPPORT. AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT FURTHER EXACERBATES THE TRAUMA AND THE GRIEF AND THE LOSS THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING WHEN OUR SYSTEM LET THEM DOWN. SO WE NEED BETTER COMMUNICATION WITH OUR SURVIVORS ALSO. I'M THE LAST THING TAT I WANT TO LAST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS JUST FROM THE SURVIVOR'S PERSPECTIVE A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT THINGS- SURVIVORS THEMSELVES HAVE RAISED SOME REALLY BIG ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY THAT I JUST LIKE TO ELABORATE ON THE FIRST IS THE COOPERATION RISK REQUIREMENT YOU KNOW COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR COMPENSATION IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR SOME SURVIVORS IT'S DETERMINED AT THE POINT OF THE POLICE REPORT SO RIGHT IN THE MOMENT SURROUNDING THE TRAUMA. YEAH IF THE SURVIVORS EXPERIENCING A DRAMATIC RESPONSE IF THEY ARE FEARFUL IF THEY ARE HURT IF THEY ARE GRIEVING IF THEY ARE IN SHOCK THEN THEY MAY NOT PARTICIPATE OR COOPERATE AND THAT MAY BE PART OF THEIR DRAMATIC REACTION NOT NECESSARILY THEIR LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT YET THOSE DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE VERY QUICKLY IN THE PROCESS. THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED AS A QUALIFICATION FOR ACCESSING COMPENSATION FOR SURVIVORS THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT W CAN DO THIS- FOR EXAMPLE THEIR INTERACTION WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THEIR INTERACTION WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT SERVICES WE CAN USE OTHER MECHANISMS TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE IS COMPLAINING OR TRYING TO REACH RECEIVE SERVICS RATHER THAN THE COOPERATION REQUIREMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT. ANOTHER DIFFICULT ONE THAT SURVIVES EXPRESSES THE REIMBURSEMENT ONLY MODEL THAT THE SURVIVORS HAVE TO PAY FIRST AND THEN WAIT TO BE REIMBURSED. AND WE APPRECIATE THE CALL B. C. B. HAS DECREASED THOSE NOTIFICATION TIME SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW- BETTER WHEN THEY ARE EITHER FUNDED OR NOT FUNDED FOR COMPENSATION BUT IT STILL REQUIRES THEM TO PUT MONEY UP FRONT. AND ONLY HAVE SURVIVORS THAT ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK THEY CANNOT PAY UP FRONT AND BE REIMBURSED SO THEY OFTEN JUST DON'T APPLY FOR SERVICES OR GET THINGS DONE LIKE HAVING THE CLOCK CRIME SCENE CLEANUP. OR MOVING TO BE SAFER OR SEEKING TREATMENT AND CARE AND SO THEY ARE NOT RECOVERING BECAUSE OF THAT. CONTRIBUTION IS ANOTHER BIG AREA- DECIDING IF SOMEONE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRIME CAN OFTEN BE SUBJECTIVE AND DETERMINED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND OFTEN LEAVES REALLY DESERVING VICTIMS OUT. I WAS IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY RECENTLY LISTENING TO SURVIVORS SPEAKING LIVE LISTENING SESSIONS. AND A SURVIVOR WHO- THEIR FAMILY MEMBER HAD GOTTEN INTO A CAR WITH SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN DRINKING. THAT DRUNK DRIVER GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT SHE WAS PARALYZED THE SURVIVOR WAS PARALYZED BUT LIVED- AND SHE DID NOT QUALIFY FOR COMPENSATION BECAUSE SHE GOT INTO A CAR WITH SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN DRINKING. AND SHE CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET INTO A CAR WITH SOMEONE WHO'D BEEN DRINKING THINKING THAT SHE WOULD END UP PARALYZED AND EVENTUALLY DYING FROM HER INJURIES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT OUR FAMILY GOT NO SUPPORT IN MEDICAL BILLS AND FUNERAL BURIAL OR ANY MAIL MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR THEM. TO HEAL FROM THIS TRAGIC LOSS. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE WE HAVE REALLY SIGNIFICANT HARM CAUSED BUT WE ARE OUR RESOURCES DON'T CONNECT FOR THAT KIND OF A SURVIVOR. ANOTHER ISSUE I'D LIKE TO RAISE AS A CLINICIAN IS THAT WE HAVE VERY LOW FEES FOR THERAPISTS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. AND THAT IS A REAL BERIT BARRIER FOR US ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDING PROPRIETORS AND TREATMENT FOR SURVIVORS- THE COMPENSATION RATE IS VERY LOW LESS THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS EVEN FOR LICENSED CLINICIANS. WHICH MEANS THAT MOST CLINICIANS WILL NOT TAKE CRIED SURVIVORS ON THEIR CASELOAD- IN THEIR PRIVATE PRACTICE MAKING IT REALLY HARD FOR US TO FIND TIMELY RESOURCES. FOR OUR SURVIVORS INCLUDING THINGS LIKE LANGUAGE CAPACITY OR A SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN TRAUMA OR CRISIS- IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO FIND PEOPLE THAT WILL WORK AT THOSE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES YET WE HAVE HUGE YOU NEED. BOTH IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND FOR CRYING BIG UP BECOMES. I'M THE LAST ONE IS THAT LOST WAGES ARE OFTEN DEPENDENT ON COOPERATION WITH AN EMPLOYER AND WE HAVE HAD MANY SURVIVORS DISCUSSED THEIR CHALLENGES WITH GETTING THEIR EMPLOYERS TO COOPERATE WITH US. AND THEREFORE MISSING OUT ON SUPPORT. SO WE KNOW THAT IF THISIS THE BARRIER FOR MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO APPLY FOR THE COMPENSATION AND THEN THEY DON'T USE THAT TO HEAL AND RECOVER AND TO GET BETTER FOLLOWING THE CRIME VICTIMIZATION. I'M IN A LOT I'M SORRY THE LAST ONE IS SURVIVORS OF GUN VIOLENCE WHO ARE OFTEN NOT ELIGIBLE BECAUSE OF CONTRIBUTION OR COOPERATION ISSUES. IT'S REALLY IMPERATIVE THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE HARMED NO MATTER HOW THEY ARE HARMED HEALING RECOVER IT PROTECTS THEM IT PROTECTS THE FAMILY IT PROTECTS THE REST OF US. WHO ARE AROUND HIM BECAUSE IT DECREASES VIOLENCE SO HEALING TRAUMA DECREASES VIOLENCE. AND THE LAST THING I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT- SOME GENDER RESPONSIVE- ISSUES THAT ARE PARTICULAR AROUND. VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND WORKING WITH PRIME SURVIVORS- COMPLEX TRAUMA WHICH IS TRAUMA REACTIONS THAT MANY WOMEN AND GIRLS EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY THE TRAUMA THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO OR HAVE BEE TOWARD. COMES FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE IN RELATIONSHIPS WITH WHETHER THOSE ARE FAMILY OR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS- ARE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS IN THE COMMUNITY THE KIND OF HARM THAT'S CAUSED FROM THAT KIND OF VIOLENCE. IS REALLY CHALLENGING TO TREAT AND IT TAKES- INTERVENTION AND SUPPORT AND TREATMENT BUT IT'S OFTEN NOT ACCESS BY PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE PROTECTING THE PEOPLE OF HARM THEM. AND THEY DON'T GET BETTER SO WE NEED WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEN MAKE THE TREATMENT AND SERVICES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THEM. WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER GENERATIONAL TRAUMA- GENERATIONAL TRAUMA MAY CAUSE PEOPLE TO NOT COOPERATE OR TRUST OR DISCLOSED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCES THAT THEY HAVE HAD. IN THEIR FAMILY OR IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHY THOSE CONTRIBUTION AND- COOPERATION. EXCLUSIONS REALLY A FACT PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. ALSO ECONOMIC ISSUES VICTIMS MAY BE MAY BE DEPENDENT ON THE PERSON THAT CAUSE THEM HARM THE PERSON THAT'S CAUSING BY VIOLENCE. AND IN THAT WAY THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO LEAVE OR TO DO ACCESS RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY MIGHT LOSE THEIR INCOME THEIR HOUSING. OTHER SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN THEY MIGHT HAVE IMMIGRATION ISSUES THAT ARE TIED TO THE PERSON THAT'S CAUSING THEM HARM- AND THIS THIS DOESN'T HELP THEM GET BETTER AND RECOVER. AND HEAL FROM THE TRAUMA SO WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WERE REQUIRING VICTIMS TO DO IN ORDER TO ACCESS SERVICES. AND THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO END WITH THIS REALLY FOCUSING ON HEALING AND RECOVERY. WHEN SOMEONE IS IN A DRAMATIC RESPONSE. PARTICULARLY IF THEY HAVE HAD MULTIPLE THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM IN THEIR LIFETIME. IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEEK OUT AND COMPLY WITH TREATMENT ESPECIALLY RIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED. SO WE NEED TO BETTER FOLLOW UP AND COMMUNICATION AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMELINE OF HOW PEOPLE REACT TO TRAUMA. AND CREATE OUR SYSTEMS AROUND THAT KNOWLEDGE NOT CREATE SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONDING TO TRAUMA AND VIOLENCE- AND NOT ABLE TO ACCESS. SERVICES IMMEDIATELY BUT MAY NEED THEM DOWN THE ROAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND FOR THE IMPORT WORK YOU'RE DOING WE'RE GONNA HAVE DOCTOR ALICIA. WHICH ARTILLERY DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL LINES THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DOCTOR ALICIA BACILLARY AND I'M ON THE FACT. THAT THE A OF THE IBC SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M ALSO ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER MODELED I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY. NOT TO HEAR ME TALK ABOUT THE TRUMP BECAUSE WE SENT A MODEL BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE OF SPIDERS FACE AS THEY TRY TO ACCESS SERVICES. TO BEGIN WITH YOU KNOW THAT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE A VIOLENT CRIME. END UP- EXPERIENCING SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES IF THEY'RE NOT GIVEN TREATMENT IN A TIMELY FASHION WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DELAY IN TREATING TRAUMA. ENDS UP HAVING A WHOLE HOST OF PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ARE WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE DEVASTATING AFTERMATH THAT DEPRESSION AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. CAN HAVE ON A VICTIM'S AND UNTREATED TRAUMA ALSO LEADS TO- PEOPLE BEING UNABLE TO WORK. LEADS TO BANKRUPTCY PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN STABLE HOUSING LEADS TO POOR QUALITY OF LIFE. AND ARE AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY WE KNOW THAT VIOLENCE NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE INDIVIDUAL BUT IT HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT. THROUGHOUT THEIR FAMILIES AND INTO THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE LIVE. AND BOB WHAT ARE GOING TO BE SAYING TODAY- IS REALLY ECHOING WHAT- THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE SAID AND THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE- ONE STUDY THAT WAS DONE. IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR OTHER STATES I ENDED UP- IDENTIFIED ONLY 20% OF THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME WHAT AWARE VICTIM COMPENSATION FUNDS. ONLY 4% OF SURVIVORS OF FELT THAT THEIR NEEDS WERE ADDRESSED BY THE CURRENT VICTIM SERVICE SYSTEM AND WE ALSO KNOW. THAT THE MOST HAUNTED BY THE LEAST HELPED AND WE KNOW THAT UP COMMUNITIES FALL BELOW AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE PARTICULARLY NOT GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED THAT THEY ARE FACING MANY MORE OBSTACLES AND POPS UP MANY. MORE BATTERIES AND OBSTACLES. SO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES. ARE THE STATE. OF ENDED UP CREATING A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AND ASKED- THE UC SAN FRANCISCO PARTNERING WITH THE CALIFORNIA- VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT CALLED THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER AND THE GOAL OF IT. WAS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL VICTIM SERVICES ARE WHICH IS BASED ON THE WEAK REIMBURSEMENT RATE BASED ON THE COMPENSATION FUND. AND SO THE TERRACING MODEL WE HAVE DEVELOPED THIS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AND THE THRUST OF IT IS THE OTHER MODEL REALLY I USED AS AN ASSERTIVE OUTREACH MODEL SO WHAT WE DO WE MEET THE CLIENT WHERE THEY ARE WE DO HOME VISITS WE MEET PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE PROVIDE PRACTICAL ASSISTANCE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES WE KNOW THAT OUR SURVIVORS NEED HELP WITH THE WHOLE ARRAY OF THINGS THEY NEED HELP. WITH GETTING SICK HOUSING MAY NEED HELP IN FILING A POLICE REPORT THEY NEED HELP IN HEALING. SO WE ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AS WELL. VERY IMPORTANTLY THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER THE ALSO HELPS TO COORDINATE CARE. OVER THIS HUGE SYSTEM THAT VICTIMS FIND THEMSELVES TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEMS OF MEDICAL CARE MENTAL HEALTH CARE LAW ENFORCEMENT LEGAL ISSUES AND SOCIAL SERVICES. THIS COORDINATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT PROVIDING THIS COORDINATION. WE KNOW WHAT SURVIVORS EASILY CAN FOR THE CRACKS AND EASILY CANNOT END UP GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. ALSO THE MODEL. I HAS BEEN TO BE BOTH AND COST EFFECTIVE OTHERS AROUND YOU STREET TRY THAT WAS ON IT AND SUBSEQUENTLY ADDITIONAL RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT THE MODEL IS BOTH CLINICALLY AND COST EFFECTIVE. FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RATE BY WHICH SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS RECEIVE ENTAL HEALTH FOLLOW UP INCREASED FROM 6% TO SEVENTY ONE PERCENT. WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW IT INCREASING COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH A 69% INCREASE IN POLICE REPORTS FILED. BUT VERY IMPORTANTLY. WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW 74% IMPROVEMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH AND- SIXTEEN SESSIONS PTSD SYMPTOMS WERE DECREASED BY FORTY SIX PERCENT. AND SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION DECREASED BY 47% AND IMPORT LEAD TO USC WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE THE T. R. C. MODEL COSTS. 34% LESS THAN USUAL CAL. SO WITH THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN MIND THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED INTO LAW SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT HAVE LEAD TO APPLICATION OF CHEER SEASON CALIFORNIA. AND BECAUSE OF THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF THIS MODEL AND BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD THEY ARE NOW EIGHTEEN TO YOUR SEIZE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS HAS LED TO A REPLICATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO THERE ARE NOW THIRTY NINETEEN OF CITIES LOCATED IN EIGHT STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I'M GRATEFUL TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOR THE SUPPORT AND- HELP THE CITY FOR THE SUPPORT AND BECAUSE OF THIS THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS. AND SURVIVORS OF VIOLENT CRIME I NEVER RECEIVING SERVICES THROUGH THE TNC MODEL OUT ABBA. FATHER IS. YOUR SEATS ARE NOT LOCATE IN EVERY COMMUNITY SO WE KNOW THAT THESE VARIOUS STILL EXIST FOR A LOT OF OUR- SURVIVORS AND EVEN OF. VICTIMS ARE TREATED AT A TSC STILL HAVING SOME PROBLEMS ACCESSING- REIMBURSEMENT TO THE VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND ALL WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT VICTIMS DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR OUT OF POCKET. EXPENSES SUCH AS BURIAL EXPENSES AND-THE LOCATION OF COURSE. AND SO THEY OFTEN HAVE TO WAIT YOU KNOW AT LEAST A MONTH TO TWO MONTHS TO HEAR WHETHER OR NOT THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN APPROVED OR DENIED. AND THEN IF IT'S BEEN APPROVED THEY OFTEN HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TWO MONTHS TO GET REIMBURSED. FOR SERVICES AND HAS BEEN HAS BEEN POINTED OUT MANY OF OUR OTHER SURVIVORS SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR- SERVICES UP FRONT- AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN. OUT OF THE- THE BANK POLICE. IS PROBLEMATIC MANY ARE ARE AFRAID OF RETALIATION BY PERPETRATORS OF MANY OF THEM- MAY MISTRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT OR MANY OF THEM ARE SIMPLY SO OVERWHELMED BY THE SYMPTOMS THAT DRIVEN INTO ISOLATION. ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE BARRIERS EXIST- I REALLY HAVE TO APPLAUD CAL B. C. B. FOR ALL OF THE CHANGES THEY'VE MADE OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE SIMPLIFIED THINGS AND IN FACT. THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TRANSLATING ANY OF THEIR BROCHURES AND APPLICATIONS INTO A LOT OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. HOWEVER MY SURVIVORS ARE STILL TELLING US THAT SOME OF THE CORRESPONDENCE THEY RECEIVED OF AROUND APPROVAL OR DENIAL I USUALLY JUST IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND I'M NOT TRANSLATED INTO OTHER LANGUAGES- I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER VIGNETTES BUT FOR THE SAKE OF TIME- I THINK I WILL. AND NOW AND I JUST WANT TO. MENTION THAT THE ISSUES THAT WERE TODAY CAL. I'M NOT UNIQUE TO. THE ARE ISSUES THAT. OF VIOLENT CRIME ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FACING- AND PARTICULARLY- THE SYSTEM OF CARE IS BADLY BROKEN IT'S IT IS NOT- THIS BURDENSOME AND NOT PARTICULARLY TIME TIME AWAY AND- I THINK CALIFORNIA REALLY HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN THE COUNTRY. AROUND VICTIM SERVICES AND- I BELIEVE CONGRATULATE THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WANTING TO ENVISION. RETHINKING THE WAY SERVICES ARE DELIVERING DELIVERED AT- THINKING ABOUT CENTRALIZING VICTIM SERVICES SO THAT THE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED IN A EQUITABLE AND- HEALING WAY FUMBLE MOMENT THIS FALL COMMUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THAT- WE WILL WE WILL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS NOW OF THE PANELISTS- WE ALSO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CORRECT THAT- BEFORE I OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES- HERE I WANT TO THANK ALL THE- PANELISTS WHO ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS BUT WANTED TO START OFF BY ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE A VICTIM SERVICE CONSOLIDATION PLAN WHERE IN THE THIRTY YEAR OF A PANDEMIC AND SO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT SOME THINGS WERE DELAYED BUT WE WE'VE LEARNED TO LIVE IN THIS NEW REALITY- AND SO WOULD DO WE HAVE A PLAN TO GET IS THAT CONSOLIDATION PLAN ANYTIME SOON IS LINDA GLADSTONE I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION- AS YOU HAD MENTIONED YOU KNOW SINCE THIS WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. BUDGET PROPOSAL MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED- AND IN THINKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING STEPS TO FULLY ANALYZE THAT. PULLING TOGETHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE THAT SERVE VICTIMS OF CRIME TO TALK THROUGH HOW THEY SERVE VICTIMS AND WHETHER THERE IS AN OVERLAP GAP OR NEED FOR CONSOLIDATION. GIVEN THAT THE STATE WE'VE HAD SO MUCH OF OUR VOTERS APPROPRIATELY DIRECTED TOWARD THE RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC WE'RE WE'RE JUST REALLY BEGINNING THESE CONVERSATIONS AGAIN. BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO KEEP THE COMMITTEE UPDATED AS THEY PROGRESS. I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT I WILL SAY THAT- THE YOUR STATEMENT INCLUDED THE NEED FOR CONSOLIDATION AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TROUBLING GIVEN THAT WE'VE COME. WE HAVE COME TO THAT AGREEMENT. I YEARS AGO- AND SO I JUST WANT TO PUSH BACK ON ON THAT PART AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE WITH THE LACES. FURTHER AS WE DO THIS THIS WORK OUT THERE. ON SO A DISBURSING AND THEN. ADD A NUMBER OF OUR PANELISTS TALKED ABOUT THE MODEL FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT MODEL THAT WE HAVE AND HOW IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK FOR A LOT OF OUR- VICTIMS. OUT THERE US IS THERE LOWER INCOME SO WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY THE MODEL BECOMES CUMBERSOME. AND LACKS EQUITY. ARE THERE ARE THERE OTHER PLACES WHERE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MODEL THAT'S BEING USED- OUT THERE RIGHT NOW OR- CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- CAL THE CV SPEAK TO ANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT WAY AGAINST YOU SEEN EVERY ENFORCEMENT MODEL AND I ALSO WANT TO BE FAIR. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO BE CIVIL. DEVIN CLARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER MODELS THIS TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONSIDER PROPOSALS THAT COULD STRENGTHEN VICTIM SERVICES AND RESULT IN DEFICIENCIES FOR STATE GOVERNMENT- AND BE HAPPY TO BE CONSTRUED BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR STAFF TO EVALUATE THAT. DO ANY OF THE PANELISTS KNOW IF THERE'S ANY MODELS OUT THERE. OR ANY ISSUES WITH USING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MODEL THAT THAT REIMBURSEMENT. WELL I CAN SAY THAT- AGAIN THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER MALL WELL THERE'S A TEAM IN THE STATE I WILL SAY THAT MOST OF THEM REALLY ARE NOT FUND IT UP TO THE LEVEL THAT WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE FUNDED YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SMALLER PROGRAMS ARE ONLY FUNDED AT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S CERTAINLY IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO RUN AN ENTIRE CENTER- AND THERE ARE SOME THAT. OF SO OUT OF THE EIGHTEEN TRC'S I THINK OF THERE WOULD BE ANY BECAUSE THE MODEL HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE SO EFFECTIVE TO BE ABLE TO. IMPROVE THE FUNDING FOR THOSE EIGHTEEN TO YOUR SEASON ALSO TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE FUNDING MORE AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL TIER CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I THINK YOU MIGHT MY LAST QUESTION IS- ABOUT THE- COMMENTS THAT WAS BY A MEMBER OF THE PANEL IS BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT- WITHIN THEIR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS COMPENSATION FOR NON COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT I KNOW THAT THOSE NUMBERS. POLICE THOSE COMMENTED THAT THEY IT HAS GONE DOWN BUT IT'S STILL EXIST. OUT THERE- THE FEDERAL LOCAL FIX ACT WHICH PASSED. JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE CLARIFY THE STATE ARE NOT REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL RULES TO THE NIGHT VICTIMS. OR SURVIVORS FOR COMPENSATION FOR NON COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. EIGHTEEN OPPORTUNITY FOR STATES TO CHANGE THESE POLICIES I KNOW THAT- TO REMOVE THE LAMPERT'S FROM ACQUIRE MANY TO STATUTORY CHANGE BUT ARE THERE ANY STEPS THAT CALVI CV CAN MAKE TO ADMINISTRATIVELY OR THE REGULATIONS TO EASE THIS REQUIREMENT- AND IS THIS SOMETHING THAT- CAL THE CV IS DOING. AS YOU NOTED AS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ARE TOP ECB- CORPORATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS ALREADY WRITTEN INTO STATUTE FOR CERTAIN CRIMES. SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT WE BELIEVE ANY AND FURTHER CHANGES WOULD REQUIRE A STATUTORY CHANGE. AT WHERE IS THERE ANY- IS ANYTHING THEY COULD ADMINISTER LEAD TO EASE THE REQUIREMENT ADDITIONALLY ARE. YOUR HANDS ARE COMPLETELY TIED I GUESS IS MY QUESTION. YEAH WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT MIND YOU KNOW OUR THEM READING OF THE STATUTE IS THAT- AGAIN OPERATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS KEY TO WANT IN AT THE END OF THE HAVE AN APPROVED APPLICATION. WHAT ABOUT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAS THE ONE OF THE COMMENTS MADE ABOUT THAT DECISION BE MADE REALLY EARLY ON AND THE PROCESS- BUT THEN WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT THE TRC'S WE HEARD THAT. VICTIMS SCHOOL. ACCESSING THE TEAR CEASE- SERVICES WERE MORE LIKELY TO INCREASE THEIR THEIR COOPERATION WITH. WITH LAW AND ENFORCEMENT- JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S I UNDERSTAND THE PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE DUTIES TO LOOK AT THAT YOU IN THAT LETTER THAT LIFE ON US AND THAT YOU AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US TO WORK THERE MAYBE THIS YEAR- AND SO- I APPRECIATE THAT BUT JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S- MORE CREATIVE WAYS TO. TO THINK ABOUT THIS THAT THIS WOMAN FROM FROM YOUR AT THE SIDE OF THINGS. I THANK YOU FOR THAT I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING R. AND IT. YOU KNOW IT'S THE WE WANT TO GET APPROVED APPLICATIONS BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO THEN BEGIN TO GET HAVE BILLS REIMBURSED- AND PART OF THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS MAKING SURE THAT A CRIME WAS COMMITTED THAT WAS A QUALIFYING CRIME. AND THAT THERE WEREN'T IT'S GENERATING CIRCUMSTANCES- SUCH AS CORPORATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT OUR INVOLVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE AN APPLICATION AN APPLICANT IN ELIGIBLE- SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE WORK THROUGH AND EVERY DAY HERE COUNTY CD DO TRY TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WORK CORRECTLY. APPLYING THE RULES AND REGULATIONS SURROUNDING THE PROGRAM THAT CURRENTLY ITS LAST STATUTE ALSO- I WAS- THAT A MEDICAL REPORT CAN BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF A POLICE REPORT. SO IF SOMEONE IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. AND THEY GO TO A HOSPITAL THE HOSPITAL IS ABLE TO SUBMIT RECORDS- AND THAT THAT SHOULD COUNT INSTEAD OF A POLICE REPORT- BUT NOT. ALL THE TIME MY- WITH SOME OF THE TIME THOSE RECORDS ARE REALLY NOT ACCEPTED. SO IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A- OF LACK OF CLARITY. HOW THAT IS BEING INTERPRETED AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM THAT WE AS- MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. SHOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY I HAVE SEEN THIS PERSON AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE A VICTIM OF A VIOLENT CRIME. SO I THINK WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE STATURE TO CHANGE. I THINK IF THERE COULD BE SOME MORE EDUCATION- THAT CAL THE CITY COULD OF PROVIDE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT WE CAN SUBMIT- THAT KIND OF DOCUMENTATION IN LIEU OF A POLICE. REPORT I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. RIGHT SURVIVOR REMARKS AS ARE FOR SPECIFIC CRIMES- THAT ARE LAID OUT AND STATUTES SO THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. ARE AREAS WHERE WE CAN CHANGE MENTAL HEALTH STATEMENT OR OR MEDICAL PROVIDER STATEMENT AND BLUE. OF A CRIME REPORT- AND STATEMENT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO EVERY CRIME. OKAY THE THANK YOU FOR. FOR THAT I WOULD HAVE AT. YOU KNOW AND EVEN WHEN WE DO HAVE THE STATUS IN THESE CASES LIKE YOU TO SET UP- THE COMMENT ABOUT NEEDING MAYBE ADDITIONAL EDUCATION- BOTH TO MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND THE SAME THING TO VICTIMS I DO APPRECIATE. THE WORK THAT'S GONE ON TO UPDATE THE WEBSITE TO HAVE LOCATIONS THERE. ARE THE TEARS HE SERVED IN OUR REGION SO I DO A KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN A LOT OF WAYS CALIFORNIA IS LEADING THE WAY- AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT. THAT WORK AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I THINK FOR MYSELF IT'S ALWAYS THAT NORTH STAR OF. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND BE LEADERS AND INNOVATIVE AND- AND OTHER WAYS WHEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT HELPING THE VICTIMS HE'LL IS NOT JUST INDIVIDUAL BUT- REALLY AFFECTS THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. OUT THERE- AND I APOLOGIZE I SAID THAT I WAS MY LAST QUESTION BUT- THIS REALLY WILL BE THE LEVEL AND- THE PATTERN- THE WE HAVEN'T RAISED THE CAP SINCE TWO THOUSAND THAT'S OVER TWENTY YEARS AND SO THANK YOU FOR OF THAT WORK TO START TO LOOK INTO RAISING BOTH CAPS DO WE HAVE A MORE IS THERE A WAY TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS MORE THAN JUST EVERY TWENTY YEARS OUT THERE WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT COST OF LIVING AND JUST THINGS IN GENERAL SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND- ARE GENERALLY BUDGET PROPOSAL- THERE'S ASPIRIN INCREASES YOUR TRY STARTING TO ADDRESS THAT. BUT I JUST AS IN GENERAL YOU KNOW HOW TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE US TWENTY YEARS TO BE LOOKING AT THESE THINGS. AND THE A TF- YES THANK YOU I'M SORRY- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN AS WELL BUT AND I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. CALLINGS MISTER BANKS FOR YOUR FLOOR. YES THIS IS A- YOU MENTIONED ABOUT COOPERATION OR LACK THEREOF COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WHAT CAME TO MIND. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO VICTIM ASSISTANCE- JUST RECENTLY. AFTER AMERICAN MALE WHO IS IN HIS HOME- NO KNOCK WARRANT. LAFOREST WE WENT IN AND KILLED NOT ONLY WAS NOT THE PERSON THEY WERE LOOKING FOR- IT SEEMED AS IF THE CHIEF OF POLICE IN THAT PARTICULAR AGENCY. WAS ALMOST LIKE THIS IS JUST A CASUALTY OF WAR. AND PEOPLE ESPECIALLY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE NOT CASUALTIES OF WAR WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT MAKES A MISTAKE. AND ALSO APPEARED AS IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE A COVER UP. OF THAT INCIDENT WHICH IS VERY DISTURBING. SAME THAT THE PROCEDURES THAT WE USE WERE CORRECT. AND WE HAD AN ACCIDENT. IN THAT CASE IT WERE TO HAPPEN HERE. BOB I COULD SEE WHERE. BECAUSE OF FUTURE LITIGATION- UNIONS GETTING INVOLVED PROTECTING OFFICERS THAT YOU MAY NOT GET COOPERATION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CONVERSELY THE FAMILY MAY NOT WANT TO COOPERATE WITH SOMEONE THAT MAY HAVE KILLED. THEIR LOVED ONE AND SO HOW WOULD THAT PERSON WHO NOW IS LOST THEIR LOVED ONE IN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT. NOW ACCESS THIS IF THEY NEED COOPERATION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANY OF THESE ON AND I WOULD ALSO ADMIT AS OF FORMALLY WORKED IN A MORTUARY FOR TEN YEARS- SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED IS WAY TOO LITTLE TO PAY FOR FUNERAL ESPECIALLY OF ONE AT THE LAST MINUTE SO WHAT IF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT. FULLY COOPERATING OR BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATION IT MAY NOT BE IN IRAN FOR BEST INTEREST TO HELP WITH THIS. ANYONE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR QESTION WOULD YOU YOU KNOW TRY TO LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CRIME AND WE WERE COMPENSATING FOR THE CRIME THAT OCCURRED RATHER THAN THE INJURY SO THOSE ARE TWO IMPORTANT POINTS THAT I WANT TO MAKE OBVIOUSLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC INCIDENT- AND I WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW THAT WOULD WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT WE DO. MAKE EVERY EFFORT IN OUR AND REVIEWING APPLICATIONS THAT COME IN TO HELP AS MANY VICTIMS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. WITH WITH THAT SAID THEN- WAS LIKE. FIFTY ONE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND DENIALS AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WIDER DENIED CAN YOU GET THAT INFORMATION LEADS TO THIS COMMITTEE WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA FOR DENIAL SO WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT. WHY YOU DENIED SO THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU WITH INCREASING THE NUMBER OF NILES. THERE IS SOME INFORMATION ON YOUR- I BELIEVE IT BUT IF YOU ON'T HAVE WHAT YOU NEED OR HAVE BEEN. ADDED TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU. AND I'M GOOD AT SOME PAGE SIX OF OUR AGENDA WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION THERE. WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET SOME OF THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE ON PAGE SIX- SO ABOUT THE NILES BASED ON RACE WITH GREAT RACIAL DEMOGRAPHICS AS WELL- DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION IS OPTIONAL WHEN WE RECEIVE APPLICATIONS BUT IF WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE. MISTER JONES SAWYER POLITICS PLEASE CONTINUE. I WOULD LIKE TO BREAK DOWN I MEAN LACK OF PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE OF THE LACK OF COOPERATION I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT. BASED ON ON QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK THEM WHAT WERE THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU FELT THERE'S LACK OF COOPERATION DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T COOPERATE LACK OF COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT THAT'S WHERE I'M GETTING TO THE THERE MAY BE. UNDERLYING REASONS FOR ALL OF THIS INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING. NO WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE PROACTIVE ABOUT GETTING TO EAT YES. AS YOU WANT TO BUT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WE SEND LETTERS WITH EVERY DENIAL EXPLAINING VERY CLEARLY WHAT INFORMATION WERE MISSING- AND WE ALSO. WORK WITH AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT INFORMATION WE MAY NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION- IT'S SO. WEIRD AND SO IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE TOO MANY REMOTE CERTAINLY TRY TO DO SO. OKAY WOULD BEGIN ADAMANT BELIEVER IT BUT I THINK WANTED TO SPEAKERS EITHER DOCTOR RODRIGUEZ R. DR. BOTH LOWRY BOTH DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WERE DENIED THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING. THE QUESTION. AND SO- IF YOU CAN PROVIDE A SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE SENDING OUT. TO VICTIMS WHO DENIED THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL HELPFUL. ABSOLUTELY. AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP WITH MR JONES SAWYER SAID WE WOULD LIKE THAT THE STATURE IN THE STATURE REQUIRES CALVI CB TO CONSIDER MITIGATING FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER CORROBORATION WAS REASONABLE AND CAL THE CITY HAS PRETTY BROAD DISCRETION LAID OUT IN THE STATUTE- DO WE HAVE SOME SORT OF A PROCESS OR TRAINING FOR STAFF THAT THEY ARE PROACTIVELY LOOKING INTO THESE MITIGATING FACTORS. WHEN SOMEONE IS NOT COOPERATING. BUT WE DO HAVE. DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT WE LOOKED AT AND WE TRY TO LOOK AT THAT WHICH HOLIDAY OF THE SITUATION WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT WHAT- WE FIND ON THEIR APPLICATIONS WE ABSOLUTELY DO YOU REACH OUT TO VETERANS TO TALK TO THEM MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE GIVEN US IF THERE'S MORE INFORMATION THAT WE CAN FOR. YOU RECEIVED FROM EITHER THEM OR FOR SOMEONE ELSE SO AND THIS IS NOT A MATTER SIMPLY LOOK APPLICATION AND CHECKING OUT POTS- AS I'VE SAID BEFORE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE ARE VERY DEDICATED TO THE WORK THAT THEY DO. A LOT OF THEM CHANGED ARE HERE BECAUSE THEY REALLY WANT TO HELP VICTIMS- AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY. DOES ANYONE HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY WELL I'D LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY A CONSOLIDATION PLAN I THINK THAT'S PART OF ALSO HELPING TO HAVE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH- THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE AND AT THE- HELLO YES US A LOT OF THE PLATE AND THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A LOT ON THEIR PLATE AS WE HAVE. YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS AND SO FORTH AND SO I HOPE THAT. WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE IN A MORE JUDICIOUS MANNER ON THIS CONSOLIDATION PLANS THAT WE CAN BETTER SERVE. VICTIMS OUT THERE I DO APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE I DO APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO INCREASE SOME OF THESE CAPS THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS- TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS BETTER FOR A FOR ALL OF OUR- CRIME VICTIMS OUT THERE AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO HELP WITH SOME OF THE STATUTORY CHANGES THAT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO THE PANELISTS. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TRY NEXT- PANEL. WE ARE LOOKING AT POLICE OFFICER IN THE CERTIFICATION. AND THE AGENDA WE HAVE IT. THANK YOU WE HAVE TO OUR PANELISTS ON MANY OF IT IS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. AND JESSICA PETERS WITH THE LISTED OF ANALYST'S OFFICE. YES GOOD GO AHEAD AND SPEAK. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME RESEARCH. HERE YOU OKAY THANK YOU.

I'M JOINED AT THE HEARING. MY COLLEAGUE JACKI NELSON. THE BUREAU CHIEF LEADING THE HOST SB TWO IMPLEMENTATION TEAM. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AT THIS HEARING. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SB TWO IMPLEMENTATION IN TWO PARTS. FIRST JUST A FEW KEY POINTS ON WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WHERE WE STAND. AND SECOND THE REASONS FOR THE RESOURCE REQUEST IN THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR YOU. FARGAS THIRD PRIOR TO IT SB TWO BEING SIGNED INTO LAW. WE DESIGNATED A PART TIME TEAM TO HOLD MONTHLY DISCUSSIONS ON IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. ON NOVEMBER FIRST WE DESIGNATED A FULL TIME TEAM TO SB TWO IMPLEMENTATION. THE TEAM CURRENTLY CONSISTS OF EIGHT FULL TIME PERSONNEL AND SEVERAL PART TIME PERSONAL. IN DECEMBER WE ISSUE BOTH INTO THE FIELD ADVISING THE NEW PIECE OF ADVISING OF THE NEW PEACE OFFICER SELECTION STANDARDS MANDATED AB EIGHTY NINE. AND SB TWO. WE'RE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF UPDATING THE POST PEACE OFFICER PERSONAL HISTORY STATEMENT. AND ARE NOW UPDATING THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION MANUAL TO COMPLY WITH THE RELEVANT SB TWO REQUIREMENTS. WE DRAFTED AN INVESTIGATIVE POLICY MANUAL WHICH ENCOMPASSES BOTH INVESTIGATIONS COMPLETED BY POST. AND THOSE COMPLETED BY AGENCIES AND REVIEWED BY POST. WE HELD TWO WORKSHOPS IN JANUARY TO IDENTIFY THE FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED. WHEN REVIEWING SERIOUS MISCONDUCT OR DECERTIFICATION. THE FIRST WORKSHOP WAS HELD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL AND THE SECOND WITH ADVOCATES FROM A LIST PREPARED BY SENATOR BRADFORD'S OFFICE. TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE FROM OTHER STATE ENTITIES. WE HELD ONE ON ONE LICENSING A DECERTIFICATION DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FOLLOWING STATES. WASHINGTON OREGON NEVADA UTAH ARIZONA TENNESSEE NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS. OUR COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS HAVE COMPLETED THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ONLINE PLATFORM FOR RECEIPT OF COMPLAINTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC A PLATFORM MODELED AFTER THE EXISTING PLATFORM USED BY DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. WE'VE ALSO SUBMITTED A STATE ONE BUSINESS ANALYSIS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF TECHNOLOGY TO CAPTURE AND MANAGE DATA ENUMERATED IN SB TWO. OUR STAFF HAS DESIGNED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE FORTY HOUR TRAINING COURSE MANDATED FOR MEMBERS OF THE NEW PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS ACCOUNT OF A- PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD. A TRAINING REQUIREMENT WE ALSO EXPECT TO PLACE ON POST STAFF MEMBERS ASSIGNED TO THE NEW STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY DIVISION. WE ANTICIPATE ROLLING OUT TO PILOT TRAINING COURSES THIS FALL. THE IMPLEMENTATION TEAM HAS DRAFTED TWENTY NEW REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB TWO AMENDED SEVEN REGULATIONS AND WILL PROPOSE THE ELIMINATION OF ONE. REGULATION WE SENT TO YEAH STORY WE SET AN INTERNAL DEADLINE THE PUBLISHED PUBLISHED THE BOOK OF THOSE REGULATIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. NO LATER THAN MARCH FIFTEENTH. WE ANTICIPATE PROPOSED PROPOSED REGULATIONS BEING COVERED BY THE POST COMMISSION ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH. OUR CURRENT YOUR HIRING STRATEGY IS TO INITIATE HIRING FOR ANY TWENTY FOUR POSITION AND FOR H. R. POSITIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT SB TWO IMPLEMENTATION. YOUR TWENTY FOUR WILL ASSIST WITH REGULATIONS AND OPERATIONAL SUPPORT RELATED SB TWO. AND WILL HATE HELP STAND UP A LEGAL UNIT. EACH OUR POSITIONS% WILL SUPPORT THE FUTURE HIRING OF PERSONNEL SHOULD THIS BE C. P. B. APPROVED. OKAY SITTING ON A HIRING FOR. NEWS HR STAFF WILL HELP US PREPARE FOR THE POTENTIAL HIRING REQUESTED IN THIS BCP. WITHOUT HAVING FOR ADDITIONAL HR PERSONNEL ARE H. R. UNIT WILL BE STAFFED WITH NINE PERSONNEL READY AND ABLE TO PROCESS LARGE SCALE HIRING. FURTHERMORE WE WILL ADVERTISE MANY OF THE POSITIONS CALL FOR IN THIS B. C. P. IN THE SPRING. WITH THE CABBIE OUT TO APPLICANTS OF THE HIRING WILL BE CONTINGENT UPON THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE BCP. IN TERMS OF THEIR REQUEST IN THIS B. C. P. WE'VE DONE PROJECTIONS ON THE VOLUME OF INCOMING DATA. THE NUMBER OF REVIEWS WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE. AND THE NUMBER OF THE CERTIFICATIONS. WE'VE UTILIZED SOME OF OUR OWN EXISTING DATA AS WELL AS DATA FROM OTHER STATES. TO MAKE THESE PROJECTIONS. THE CHALLENGES SUCH THAT POST R. S. B. TWO. HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED OR PERMITTED TO COLLECT THE DATA LISTED IN THE LEGISLATION. TO COMPOUND THE ISSUE EACH STATE HANDLES DECERTIFICATION DIFFERENTLY WITH THE BULK OF STATES PROCESSING REVOCATIONS BASED ON CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS OR SUSTAINED INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS. IN OTHER WORDS COMPARING DATA FROM OTHER STATES IS IN PERFECT. THUS WE UNDERSTAND THAT UNTIL WE HAVE DATA WE MUST BE OPEN TO MAKING ADJUSTMENTS. WE ARE HAPPY TO GO INTO DETAIL ON OUR PROJECTIONS AND HOW WE PLAN TO DEAL WITH THE WORKLOAD. TO ACCOMPLISH THE MANDATES IN SB TWO. A. B. C. D. ADDRESSES AMONG OTHER THINGS THE NEED FOR PERSONNEL RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY AND OFFICE SPACE. BCP REQUEST FUNDING FOR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN NEW STAFF POSITIONS TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR TECHNOLOGY IN YEAR ONE AND ONE MILLION I'M GOING. AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS I'M GOING FOR OFFICE SPACE. THE REQUEST FOR PERSONAL RESOURCES WILL ENABLE POSTED CREATING LEGAL UNIT STAFFED BY ANALYSTS AND ATTORNEYS AND AS MUCH AS WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE LEGAL STAFF. LEGAL UNIT WILL REVIEW PROPOSED DECERTIFICATION MATTERS. AND WILL WORK WITH THE NEW ADVISORY BOARD. THE COMMISSION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WITH ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES WHO WILL BE CONDUCTING EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS. BCP ALSO CALLS FOR A NUMBER OF KEY UNITS SUCH AS AN INTAKE UNIT TO RECEIVE TRACK AND FOLLOWED TO COMPLETION ALL ALLEGATIONS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT TO FIND IN SB TWO. A STANDALONE CERTIFICATE UNITY ISSUED AND ADMINISTRATIVELY REVOKE CERTIFICATES. A UNIT DEDICATED TO THE REVIEW OF MATTERS PERTAINING TO EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE AND TWO OTHER UNITS TO REVIEW ALL OTHER MATTERS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. FUNDING FOR STAFF POSITIONS IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. THE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS LISTED IN THE B. C. P. ONE ABLE CLOSE TO FINALISE IMPLEMENTATION IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. AND WILL ENABLE THE STATE TO MAINTAIN A ROBUST PROGRAMS YEAR AFTER YEAR. A. B. C. P. ALSO REQUESTS FUNDING FOR TECHNOLOGY AND ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT IS NOTED EXCHANGING DATA WITH OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS MUST BE DONE ELECTRONICALLY. S. B. C. P. REQUEST FUNDING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. TO RECEIVE INFORMATION CONDUCT REVIEWS. AND ACTIVISTS OCCASIONS REFORM CASE MANAGEMENT ELECTRONICALLY STORED DECERTIFICATION INFORMATION FOR THIRTY YEARS HAS CALLED FOR AN S. B. TWO. IN TERMS OF THE OFFICE SPACE CLOSE IS CURRENTLY STAFFED BY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE PERSONNEL. LOCATED% IN ONE PHYSICAL OFFICE SPACE. SECURING SPACE TO CO LOCATE THE NEW DIVISION IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY. ENTERTAINING ONE SINGLE OFFICE SPACE WILL INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY. WILL ALLOW CODES MANAGEMENT TO EFFECTIVELY MARSHAL RESOURCES WHEN NECESSARY. WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR WE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO TESTIFY- COMMITTEE. RIGHT TO TESTIFY TO YOUR COMMITTEE ON SORRY AND WE STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU REPORT QUESTIONS WILL HEAR FROM OUR SECOND PANELIST WITH THE ALLEY OF OFFICE. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE OB PRESENTING FOR- JESSICA PETERS TODAY. WE DOWANT TO NOTE THAT POSE HAS DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO BEGIN SB TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS SUCH AS CONSULTING WITH OTHER STATES AS WAS NOTED WE DO HOWEVER RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT POST TO SUBMIT AN UPDATED PROPOSAL THIS SPRING THAT ADDRESSES TWO CONCERNS WE'VE IDENTIFIED WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSAL. OUR FIRST CONCERN IS THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT APPEAR TO REQUEST RESOURCES FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF SB TWO IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICALLY HOSTED INFORMED US THAT THEIR REQUEST IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATED NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS. THAT POST EXPECTS TO GET IN THE FUTURE BUT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AN INITIAL SURGE OF WORKLOAD IT WILL GET FROM ALLOCATE ALLEGATIONS. OF MISCONDUCT THAT OCCURRED IN THE PAST. IN ADDITION. HE PROPOSAL DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR ONE TIME CERTIFICATION WORKLOAD TO ISSUE PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY CERTIFICATES TO OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO HAVE A BASIC CERTIFICATE. OR OTHER SECOND MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES FACING COAST- MOST NOTABLY AS WAS INDICATED POST WILL MEET TO ROUGHLY DOUBLE ITS STAFFING BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE ONLY SIX MONTHS AFTER RECEIVING FUNDING IN THE STATE BUDGET. ALSO HOSTS CURRENT OFFICE SPACE IS INSUFFICIENT AND TO ACCOMMODATE THE PROPOSED EXPANSION WILL NEED ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE WHICH THEY'RE REQUESTING. OTHER DGS HAS INFORMED THEM THAT ALL OF LIKELY TAKE A YEAR OR MORE TO SECURE. ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE. IN ADDITION I WAS WAS IN THE POST WILL NEED TO OBTAIN IN TAKES ON INTAKE SOFTWARE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE REPORTS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND HAVE THE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT OPPOSED TO SUBMIT A REVISED PROPOSAL AT THE MAY REVISION THAT PROVIDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH PAST ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. AND THE PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY ISSUE ONCE AND ALSO DETAILS HOW. WILL ADDRESS THIS WORKLOAD AND DESCRIBES HOW POST WILL GO ABOUT. ADDRESSING THE IMPLEMENTATION. CHALLENGES DISCUSSED ABOUT. I'M NOT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE NUMBERS THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR THAT CAN-MISTER ALVAREZ- COMMON RESPOND TO THE ELIAS'S CONCERN ABOUT HURRYING OVER A HUNDRED POSITIONS IN SIX MONTHS AND HOW WILL BE PREPARED FOR THAT. YES MADAM CHAIR SO WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN POSITIONS ON BOARD AS OF JANUARY ONE WE DO FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO HAVE. SOME OF THE POSITIONS ON BOARD TO PROVIDE TRAINING. AND TO HELP US MOVE ALONG BUT IN TERMS OF YOU NOW SUS OF DATA AND- THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED. THERE IS NO DATE UNTIL JANUARY ONE SO WE DO NOT FEEL THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ALL OF THOSE STAFF MEMBERS ON BOARD BY JANUARY ONE- WE DO FEEL LIKE WE WILL NEED SOME AND THAT IS. GEN STARTING IN THE SPRING. HIRING A NUMBER OF THEM IN JULY ON. JULY ONE SHOULD THE BCP BE APPROVED. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE- IS MENTIONED THAT WE NEED EVERYBODY ON ON BOARD. I'M ON DAY ONE. AND SO WHY IS THE REQUEST OF THE BUDGET REQUEST ASKING US FOR ALL OF THE FOR THE FUNDING FOR ALL THE POSITIONS VERSUS A STAGGERED APPROACH. WELL WE CAN DEFINITELY ADD. YOU KNOW REVISE IT FOR A STAGGERED APPROACH BUT THAT IS OUR STRATEGY AT THIS POINT- IS TO STAGGER THE HIRING- BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY ONE- I. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE PRECISE NUMBERS BUT I PRESUME THAT IF WE- IF WE ARE A 50% JANUARY ONE THEN I THINK WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO REVISED THIS PROPOSAL COME. FROM FUTURE- WE WELL WE DO HAVE A SURPLUS AND THE BUDGET WE WANT TO BE JUDICIOUS WITH THESE ALLOCATIONS AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE BEING USED APPROPRIATELY- AND IF WE ARE LOOKING AT A STAGGERED APPROACH WHICH IS FINE MORE PRAGMATIC I THINK OUR BUDGET SHOULD REFLECT THAT AS WELL- THANK YOU FOR THAT. DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. RIGHT WHILE I APPRECIATE THE UPDATE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION- SB TWO IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I THINK WELL COMMITTED TO A SUCCESSFUL WORKING WITH. WITH YOUR AGENCY TO ENSURE WE ARE SUCCESSFUL AND SO LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE DISCUSSIONS ON THE FIFTH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO A THIRD ISSUE ISSUE WHICH IS. OFFICER WELLNESS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FOR THIS TESTIMONY I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE ANDREW AND DANSA WHO IS COORDINATING OUR EFFORTS ON POST WELLNESS TRAINING. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SECOND BCP. WILL BE BRIEF AND WILL ADDRESS WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF WALLACE. AND SECOND THE REASONS FOR THE RESOURCE REQUEST IN THIS P. C. P. I WAY BACKGROUND. AB EIGHTEEN TWELVE IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MANDATED POST CREATED INNOVATIONS GRANT PROGRAMS. WERE IGP. IN HOPES OF REDUCING OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. AS PART OF THE IGP POST WAS DIRECTED TO DISTRIBUTE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER A THREE YEAR TIME PERIOD IN TRAINING GRANTS. TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES ONE OF THE FIVE TOPIC AREAS DEFINED IN AB EIGHTEEN TWELVE WITH PEACE OFFICER WELLNESS. POST COMPLETED THREE SEPARATE ROUNDS OF IGP FUNDING OVER TWO YEAR TIME PERIOD. AS A RESULT A TOTAL OF TEN GRANTS TOTALING ONE MILLION DOLLARS WERE ISSUED FOR PEACE OFFICER WELLNESS TRAINING. A TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE STUDENTS RECEIVE WELLNESS TRAINING. THE FINAL IGP GRANTS EXPIRED ON DECEMBER THIRTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DURING THE INITIAL MONTHS OF COVERAGE OF THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC- SUBMITTED A B. C. D. IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY FOR AN ONLINE TRAINING PROGRAM TO MAYOR THE FIVE TOPIC REQUIREMENTS. IN A. B. EIGHTEEN TWELVE A PROGRAM WE CALLED THE DISTANCE LEARNING GRANT PROGRAM OR DEAL G. P. THE PEACE THE BASIC HE WAS A BETTER THAN AS MUCH AS CLASSROOM BASED TRAINING WAS ALL BUT ELIMINATED. IN THE ENTIRETY OF TWENTY TWENTY. BCP WAS APPROVED. AND THE FUNDING WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE FY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. THE GRANT RECIPIENTS WERE LIMITED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS IN ACADEMIA. AS PART OF THE DEAL D. O. G. P. S. WAS GRANTED AUTHORITY TO DISTRIBUTE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FIVE TOPIC AREAS ONE OF WHICH BEING WELLNESS. AS A RESULT A TOTAL OF FOUR WELLNESS GRANTS TOTALING. NINE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WERE ISSUED. A TOTAL OF SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT STUDENTS RECEIVED ONLINE WELLNESS TRAINING. THE FINAL DETAIL GP GRANT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER THIRTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY RELEASED A PSA STYLE VIDEO ON WALLACE CALLED SILENT NO MORE. AS WELL AS A TWO HOUR CLASSROOM BASED FACILITATED TRAINING VIDEO. WE ARE SCHEDULED TO HOLD WORKSHOPS TO CREATE A MATT MANDATED BASIC. I'M SORRY WE WORK SCHEDULED TO HOLD A WORKSHOP TO CREATE MANDATED BASIC ACADEMY CURRICULUM ON WELLNESS IN LATE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE FORCED TO CANCEL THE WORKSHOP DUE TO COVERT. WE'RE NOW TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED TO START UP AGAIN WITH THE WORKSHOP IN MAY. SIMILARLY FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS WE'VE BEEN REVAMPING THE DISPATCHER BASIC TRAINING COURSE. THE NEW DISPATCHER BASIC TRAINING WHICH IS MANDATED FOR ALL NEW DISPATCHERS WILL INCLUDE STANDARD CURRICULUM ON DISPATCHER WELLNESS. WE HOPE TO HAVE A DISPATCHER BASIC CURRICULUM COMPLETED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. WITH THE PLANET SOMETIME IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE DISCUSSION AT THE BEGINNING OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS CAREERS AN IMPORTANT EARLY STEP FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THE DEPARTMENT AND OUR COMMUNITY. SUFFICE IT TO SAY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON TRAINING DELIVERY. THEREFORE THIS BCP SHIPS THE PRIMARY FOCUS TO DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC WELLNESS WORKSHOPS. EACH DEPARTMENT IS DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THE WELLNESS ISSUES THEY FACE. SOME MAY FACE HIGH ON DUTY INJURIES SUICIDES LACK OF EFFECTIVE PEER SUPPORT PROGRAMS AT CENTER AT CENTER. EACH DEPARTMENT IS DIFFERENT THUS THE DELIVERABLES OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES FOR EACH DEPARTMENT MUST BE TAILORED. HOST DESIRES TO PARTNER WITH ACADEMIA CLINICIANS AND EXPERTS IN THE AREA OF WALLACE TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS TO CREATE OR IMPROVE EXISTING PROGRAMS THEY MAY ALREADY HAVE. BY LEVERAGING THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH ACADEMIA. CLINICIANS IN THE EXPERTS POST WILL EVALUATE THE ISSUES. THE DELIVERABLES CONDUCT FOLLOW THROUGH. AND WILL DETERMINE THE OUTCOMES- WILL ASSESS THE OUTCOMES FOR EACH DEPARTMENT PROJECT. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY. OFFY NOT ONLY HELP THEMSELVES IN THEIR DEPARTMENT. BETTER BETTER FOR. OUR OUR BETTER SERVICE TO THEIR COMMUNITY. STATES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT TO BE TRUE AND WE CAN GO INTO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC STUDIES IF YOU'D LIKE. THEREFORE THIS B. C. P. ADDRESSES THE CONTINUE DELIVERY OF TRAINING. BUT PERMITS THE STATE A LEADERSHIP ROLE. TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS TO FURTHER THEIR INDIVIDUAL WELLNESS OBJECTIVES. WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR. WE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO TESTIFY. AND WE STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE THE L. L. YES TRUTH SO TO WORK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL COULD HAVE SOME MERIT HOWEVER THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT IT THAT- WE- RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT POST TO RESPOND TO BEFORE APPROVING IT. SPECIFICALLY POSTED SHOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE PROGRAM ARE WELL IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE OFFICER WELLNESS THE MORE SPECIFIC PRIMARY GOALS OF THE PROGRAM REMAIN UNCLEAR SUCH AS THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF WELLNESS MENTAL PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL FOR EXAMPLE THE PROPOSALS INTENDED TO ADDRESS. IT'S ALSO NOT CLEAR WHAT THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM POSED IS ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE WITH THE PROPOSAL. SAMPLE POST IDENTIFIED WITH THE HIGHEST PRIORITY NEEDS ARE FOR IMPROVING OFFICER AND WELLNESS OR WHETHER THERE ARE GAPS IN EXISTING WELLNESS PROGRAMS OFFERED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT IT'S ATTEMPTING TO FILL. IT'S ALSO NOT EXACTLY CLEAR WHAT PRECISE ACTIVITIES WOULD BE FUNDED IN THE PROPOSAL PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE THERE WHERE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT. POST INDICATED THEY MIGHT PURSUE BUT THE SPECIFIC ONES THEY WILL PURSUE REMAIN TO BE DETERMINED. IT'S ALSO NOT CLEAR WHAT OUTCOMES WILL BE EXPECTED FROM IT FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS THAT WILL BE REACHED OR THE NUMBER OF IN TRAINING SET POSTED TENDS TO OFFER. WE ALSO FROM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CLOSE TO INDICATE TO THE LEGISLATURE HOW IT WILL IMPLEMENT BOTH THIS NEW PROGRAM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CHALLENGES IT WILL FACE AND WANTING SB TWO. IT'S SUCH A- IF THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS ARE PROVIDED BY POSTING THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINES THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS OVER OVERALL GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES AND IS LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL THE LEGISLATURE COULD. APPROVE THIS PROGRAM HOWEVER TO THE EXTENT THAT POST IS UNABLE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE RETRACTED REJECTED A PROPOSAL WITHOUT. PREJUDICE AND DIRECT POSED TO COME BACK WITH A- MORE- FULLY DEVELOPED PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR BUDGET. I THANK YOU FOR THAT THIS THE INTERNET OFFER A REBUTTAL YES PLEASE DO. THANK YOU ANY FRIENDS OR THE PARTNER FINANCE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE- AS OPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO AS WELL- MY COLLEAGUE MISTER MADONNA'S ALSO ON THE LINE AT THE PROPOSED PROGRAM DOES HAVE FAIRLY SPECIFIC GOALS WHICH PRODUCE SUPPORT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. IN BUILDING THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY TO OFFER BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL BONUS PROGRAMMING- ONE OF THE PRIMARY WAYS THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED IS BY HOSTING AGENCY WELLNESS WORKSHOPS- IN FISCAL YEARS TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. A POST WILL ALSO FACILITATE THE CREATION OF WELL AS RELATED RESOURCE OF THE MULTI MEDIA WHICH WILL BE- HOWLS ON THEIR LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AGGREGATING SEVENTY BEST PRACTICES AND WORK WITH PARTNERS ACADEMIA TO UNDERTAKE EVALUATIONS THEY CAN SUPPORT THAT IDENTIFICATION OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT POST IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED- WITH INSIGHT INTO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT GENCY OPERATIONS IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH A WELLNESS IS HANDLED WITHIN THOSE AGENCIES- AS DIRECTOR HOURS I THINK TOUCHED ON POST HAS IDENTIFIED THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP AMONG AGENCIES AT AS IT PERTAINS TO OFFERING- BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL BONUS PROGRAMS. AND NOW SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS PROGRAM- IS TAILORED TO ADDRESS- THE IDEA REALLY IS TO CREATE ACCESS AT ONCE PROGRAM THROUGH THE WORKSHOPS AND THEN DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES THAT DAY AND LAW ENFORCING AGENCIES CAN TAKE TO BUILD THEIR OWN LOCAL CAPACITY. AND WE REALLY THINK THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT- AN OVERARCHING SHIFTED. TO INCORPORATE WELLNESS. AT THAT IN HERE PARTOF LAW FOR COURT. AND TRAIN WHICH WILL. GO TO IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY OVERALL- AND AGAIN TO TOUCH ON- THE L. A. WAS POINT ABOUT ADDITIONAL JUSTIFICATION ADMINISTRATION REPORTED HAPPEN TO PROVIDE. ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INVESTIGATION NECESSARY TO BOTH BE ALEJO AND LEGISLATURE I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE INTENT IS PROPOSED TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN DELIVERING THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE- IT'S ON A CIRCUIT ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE- OF ON. THE DEPARTMENT VARY SO MUCH AND SIZE CAPACITY- GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION ETCETERA- AND POST IS REALLY THE STATEWIDE LEADER IN A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SPACE AND IT HAS THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE. ITS EXPERTISE TO INFORM THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. AND THE LAST POINT M. THE L. A. RAISE CONCERN ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ONE'S PROGRAM SB TWO. AND AGAIN INSTRUCTOR OVER AS NOTED POST HAS SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE IMPLEMENTING TRAINING PROGRAMS- PROVIDING SUPPORT TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE STATE THIS WILL BE DIFFERENT STAFF COMPLETELY- YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT WELLNESS VERSES SB TWO- SO EVEN THOUGH. SB TWO WITH OF COURSE CRITICAL OF THE CENTER FOCUS- POST DEFINITELY HAVE THE CAPACITY. IN. THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT BOTH. NOT LOCAL COULD NOT COME AVAIL FOR OTHER QUESTIONS- YEAH I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR MICHAEL. SO YOU TALK ABOUT THE GOAL OF NC AT INCREASING ACCESS AND- FLEXIBILITY I THINK FOR US HERE AND FOR MYSELF IT'S ALSO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE EFFICACY. AND THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING- YOU KNOW TOWARDS WHILE LESSEN WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANS. CURRENTLY WE HAVE CRIME PROGRAMS ALREADY THAT EXIST AND TRAININGS DO YOU HAVE DATA OR MEASUREMENTS OF HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE. I DON'T HAVE ACCESS OKAY I BELIEVE MICHAEL YEAH. I CAN SPEAK TO THE MANAGER GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME CENTER AND ALSO I'M NOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON THE WEST COAST. BOB WE DO SO UNDER THE INNOVATIONS GRANT PROGRAM WE WERE ABLE TO AN ARTISTIC RESEARCH WITH THE UC SAN DIEGO CENTER FOR MINDFULNESS THAT WE JUST RECENTLY GOT THE REPORT BACK. YET ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THAT PROGRAM IS FROM WHAT'S WILL READ BYTES CONTROLLED TRIAL SO BUT WHAT WE DID IS WE LOOK AT THREE DIFFERENT MINDFULNESS INTERVENTIONS TO LOOK TO SEE IF THERE WERE DIFFERENCES ACROSS THOSE THREE. AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ANY OF THEM HAD ANY POSITIVE IMPACT ON. CIRCUMVENT ALL ASPECTS OF THE OFFICERS I AM JUST A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THAT REPORT. BY THE UC SAN DIEGO FOUND THAT THE COMBINED INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED MEASURES OF AGGRESSION MOTIONAL REGULATION. DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES AND ORIGINALLY WASN'T A LOT OF DIFFERENCE DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF AN INTEREST WHICH USED THAT MUCH THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE SOME OF THE RESEARCH WE'VE TRIED TO DO HERE WE'VE TRIED TO DO AROUND WALLACE. THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF RESEARCH IT'S BEEN DONE AROUND VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HONEST I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'RE GONNA HAVE IF I CAN SORT OF. THINK YOU BACK OFF AT WHAT MR FRANCIA SAID IN RESPONSE ALEJO IS IT THERE IS NO AGREED UPON DEFINITION OF WHAT WELLNESS SETS SILVA COULD INCORPORATE. MENTAL HEALTH THAT COULD INCORPORATE EMOTION ALL THE CUTTING CORPORATE PHYSICAL HEALTH EVEN WITHIN. EACH OF THOSE SUBCATEGORIES. THE COULD BE SPLIT UP RIGHT SO PHYSICAL COULD BE. A PROGRAM THAT AIMED AT ASPEN. AT IN REGARDS. RIGHTS OF THIS IS WHAT L. A. T. DE WHAT THEY WANT. A THERE WILL PROGRAM AND LOOKED AT WHAT OR NOT THEY COULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON WORKERS COMPENSATION CLIENTS. WILL BE OUT BUT BETTER FOR THAT ARE COULD BE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT THAN IF WE'RE LOOKING AT AN INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO SPEAK TO YOUR- MENTAL HEALTH AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE LOOKING AT ISSUES LIKE EMOTIONAL REGULATION OR DECISION MAKING. OR ITS IMPACT ON BIAS OR ISSUES AROUND CITIZENS COMPLAINTS A WHETHER OR NOT LOWER LEVELS OF. DEMONSTRATED AND MEASURED AGGRESSION I HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT. IN THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU'RE WITH US IN THE TICKET OR WHATEVER THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF COME LOOK OUT SO FAR. ONE OF MY CONCERNS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUTCOME MEASURES AND IT'S IT IT'S A- WELL MADE POINT TO THE FAIR CRITICISMS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE'RE DOING. BUT THAT WE HAVE SOME BASIS FOR ENSURING ITS EFFECTIVENESS. IT AT THE VERY LEAST DO NO HARM RIGHT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER INTERVENTIONS ARE. BUT DON'T HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE OFFICERS DON'T HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE AGENCIES DON'T HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITIES. BOB I THINK BURKE. I'M JUST CONCERNED IF WE TRY AND- TALK IN AGGREGATE TERMS AT THE STATE LEVEL ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE OUTCOME MEASRES FOR WELLNESS. THAT THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SORT OF PARSE OUT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT REALLY OUR VISION FOR THIS. PROJECT THIS PROGRAM. IS POPPING AGENCIES TO DEVELOP CAPACITY. I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME OUTPUTS. WE COULD GET FROM THERE. BUT ONE OF THE- THIS IS CHIU DEVELOPED AT EIGHT. WHILE THE WORKSHOP. WHICH ARE MODELED. TEAM BUILDING WORKSHOPS AND THAT'S A PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES OUR AGENCIES TO SUBMIT. AFTER ACTION PLANS TO POST WE WOULD BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THOSE WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE TYPES OF INTERACTIONS THAT WERE OFFERED. IN WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT SPECIFIC OUTCOME MEASURES FOR THAT PARTICULAR AGENCY. THE IDEA LONG TERM FOR US IS TO DEVELOP. ALMOST LIKE A KNOWLEDGE BANK WHERE. WE COULD HAVE A SET OF INTERVENTIONS THAT WE COULD OFFER TO OTHER AGENCIES WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING. WITH A SIMPLE TYPE OF WELLNESS ISSUE. THAT WOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE TO OFFER OF SOME SUPPORT FOR TYPES OF THINGS THAT SEEM TO WORK WELL FOR AGENCIES TO BEGIN A SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCE. BY THE GEOGRAPHICALLY OR RESOURCE WISE- MAY BE STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUE. I'M SORRY I COULD GO INTO THAT IN MORE DETAIL HAPPY TO IF IT'S OF ANY BENEFIT TO ANYBODY. SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND STOP TALKING DOWN THE TOPPINGS ARE FOR THE QUESTIONS. I WHICH IS REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK. AT THE L. A. O.'S- QUITE. AND TRY TO PUT SOMETHING AROUND THIS I THINK THE- IDEA THAT OUR BAR IS DO NO HARM THAN I COULD. NO MONEY IS ALSO GOING TO DO NO HARM. AS OF LATE LET'S START THERE SO THAT CAN BE OUR ONLY. THAT CAN BE OUR ONLY GOAL AT THE END THEY DO WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIVE AS LEGISLATORS TO OUR TAX. TO OUR TO OUR TAXPAYERS OUT THERE TO A CONSTITUENCY THAT OUR DOLLARS ARE BEING USED IN A WISE WAY AND THAT. WE ARE GETTING POSITIVE. RESULTS AND SO I THINK THE IDEA OF. OF HAVING SOME SORT OF MEASURING EFFICACY. NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED- AND WE COULD DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY BUT THIS IDEA. THAT WILL YOU KNOW LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE. AGAIN DOESN'T WORK WITH WITH THE DUTIES WE HAVE TO ENSURE TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING USED IN A WAY THAT THAT IS WHY SAID. RESULTING IN IN POSITIVE- IN PSITIVE OUTCOMES. ALONG THE WAY AND SO I HOPE. AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS OUT THERE BASED ON EXISTING WELLNESS TRAINING SOME PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AND- YOU KNOW. SOME BEST PRACTICES THAT WE PROBABLY ALREADY ARE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT. OUT THERE. AS WELL. IN MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- OKAY WELL IF NOT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR I MEAN I'M PRESENTING THIS I THINK THE GOAL OF OFFICER WELLNESS IS THE GOOD LOFTY GOAL BUT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT WILL- MISSILES AND REAL POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND NOT JUST US. DOWN THE ROAD AND WE SPEND MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THIS ITEM THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE HAVE ISSUES FOR FIVE AND SIX ARE NON DISCUSSION ITEMS. BUT YOU WANT TO SEE IF ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD. CAME SEEN NONE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. OF COURSE IS THERE PUBLIC COMMENT- LET ME SEE DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM. NOPE OKAY SO EACH PERSON WILL HAVE A TWO ONE MINUTE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL NOW TURN TO THE PHONES. THE PHONE NUMBER TO CONNECT TO THE COMMITTEE IS ON THE WEBSITE. IT'S ALSO ON THE SCREEN OF YOUR STREAMING THIS HEARING BUT JUST IN CASE THE TOLL FREE NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE.
