WE HAVE THE SENATE WOULD LIKE TO WISH BOTH SENATORS OR COLLEGE YOU KNOW WHAT AND WHERE A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY. SENATOR NELSON. THAT'S PRESENT ON THE CONDITION THE FILE. WITHOUT OBJECTION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE PASSED ON THE CONDITION THE FILE COMMENT ON THE ACTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES YESTERDAY. IN THE ARROGANT MANNER IN WHICH THEY RELIEVE CHANCELLOR JOE CASTRO. OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES. THE DELEGATION AND ACCUSATIONS. THE PRESIDENT CASTRO WAS NEVER ALLOWED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFUTE. WHATEVER'S AT HIS OWN SIDE OF THE STORY. AND THE TRUSTEES DID NOT ALLOW THAT YESTERDAY EITHER. IN FACT IN THE PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE HAD SUGGESTED TO HIM. THEY DEVIATED FROM. I WOULD ARGUE PURPOSELY. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY INQUIRY. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AN INVESTIGATION. THE SITUATION. THE BOARD PROCEEDED THE INVESTIGATION. PROCEEDED. BASED ON ALLEGATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE FALSE ONES. AND I'VE KNOWN THE MAN FOR DECADES. HE CAME UP THROUGH THE RANKS THE CSU. BECAME A KIND OF A BREAKTHROUGH PIONEER WHERE THE CSU FOR YEARS WAS TRYING TO FIND ITS PRESIDENTS AND- NATIONWIDE SEARCHES. INSTEAD OF LOOKING WITHIN AND LIFTING UP THEIR OWN. JOE CASTRO IS ONE OF THE FIRST RANKS. WHAT MESSAGE IS THAT TRUSTEES. TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR CSU. THE MESSAGES YOUR BACKUP. YOU'LL DO WHATEVER YOU DEEM POLITICALLY CORRECT INNER REGULARLY SO AND TRY TO INSULATE YOURSELF FROM AN INNING IN FOUR IS A CRITICISM OF YOU. WELL TRUSTEES I AM ENQUIRING ABOUT. I'M GOING TO SUBMIT A REQUEST. FOR INFORMATION. ABOUT SOME OF YOUR INTERNAL PROCEDURES. AND COMMUNICATIONS THAT CIRCULATED RIGHT BEFORE THE SECTION OF YESTERDAY BETWEEN THE TRUSTEES EACH OTHER AND OTHER PARTIES. TRULY IT'S A DISGRACE. THIS IS AN OUTRAGE. AND THEY'VE TRIED TO DESTROY THE CAREER. A LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO OUR STUDENTS. JOE CASTRO. I RESENT THAT THE CAST OF UNFAVORABLE LIGHT THE ENTIRE CSU SYSTEM. AND I HOPE THE LEADERSHIP IN THE AREA. THAT INCLUDES THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT. INDIRECT RYAN FILE. LET THEIR CONCERNS BE KNOWN AS A SIGN. MAYBE THESE TRUSTEES WILL GET IT. OR MAYBE THEY'LL GRACIOUSLY HELPED US ALL BY LEAVING OFFICE. IN OUR BORDERS FOR WHAT PURPOSE. THIS PRESIDENT TO CONDITION THE FILE PLEASE. WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HAMMER US AT A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT POINTS I WON'T BELABOR THEM FURTHER. I JUST THINK IT'S A MATTER OF DUE PROCESS. THAT ALL OF US SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS MATTER WAS HANDLED AND WHAT I MEAN BY DUE PROCESS. IS THAT IF SOMEBODY IS ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING OF MATTERS. IN THERE ARE ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS ESPECIALLY INSTITUTION TEAM THIS THIS ISSUE SYSTEM. THAT INDIVIDUAL ON BE AFFORDED A CERTAIN PRESUMPTIONS UNTIL AN INVESTIGATION YIELDS A RESULT. WHAT I'M SEEING RIGHT NOW IS A PRESUMPTION OF GUILT WITHOUT HAVING ALREADY CONDUCTED AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. NO I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HAVE MERITED DISMISSAL AT SOME POINT IN TIME. OR WHETHER HE SHOULD HAVE STAYED BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN- ARE FOUND TO HAVE. ACTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES AND EXPECTATIONS. BUT I WOULD EXPECT AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING BEING LED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES WOULD HAVE ALTERED THE NOTION. OF DUE PROCESS. AND IF THAT WASN'T AFFORDED THAT I THINK WE ARE BEING HYPOCRITICAL OF WHAT WE EXPECT OUR STUDENTS TO LEARN IN OUR SYSTEM. ALL IN MY COMMENTS HERE FOLKS. ONCE AGAIN IT'S NOT WHETHER OR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL MERITED A REPRIMAND TO DISMISSAL OR AN ACQUITTAL. BUT I GUARANTEE THAT. OUTCOME THAT OCCURRED WITH THAT FORMER FRESNO STATE EMPLOYEE. HOW DO WOMEN SIGNED OFF BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE CSU SYSTEM. SO IT KIND OF BEGS THE QUESTION IF THERE WERE INTERNAL PROCESSES THE PLAY THAT HAD TO HAVE BEEN GREEN LIGHTED BY INDIVIDUALS ON THE BOARD OR WITHIN STAFF. IT FURTHER BEGS THE POINT THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE AFFORDED DUE PROCESS AND FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THAT DID NOT OCCUR HERE. JENNER COVER YOUR- CAREER FOR WHAT PURPOSE- OUR MEMBERS WERE BACK TO THE PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR. GENERAL AMONG. THE COMPANY BECAUSE MINE IS. MARK IS AVAILABLE ON THIS TOPIC. OKAY SO MEMBERS OF THE SORRY TO CHANGE THE TOPIC BUT I DID WANT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT- WE HAD ANOTHER BIRTHDAY AS SENATOR MENENDEZ WAS BIRTHDAY WAS YESTERDAY- AND SO WE ALSO WANT TO WISH HER A HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND SHE JUST STEPPED OUTSIDE BUT SHE'S HERE SOMEWHERE SO HAPPY BIRTHDAY ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE WORD WHICH SENATOR MELINDA IS.
