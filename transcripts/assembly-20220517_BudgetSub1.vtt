EQUITY ISSUES INTO STARK RELIEF

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:39.370
OUR STATE'S INEQUITIES WERE NOT

00:30:39.437 --> 00:30:41.372
CREATED BY THE PANDA. BUT THE

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:43.708
PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THEM

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:47.078
AND ELIMINATED ANY EXCUSES WE

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:49.914
MAY HAVE HAD TO NOT ADDRESS THEM

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:51.716

ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY OVER

THE LAST- TWO YEARS. MEANING

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:25.530
THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD A VERY

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:29.567
LARGE SURPLUS TO ALLOCATE. A

FORECASTING BUT- DEFINITELY

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:12.857
HEIGHTENED RISK. SO WHAT THAT

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:14.425
ALL MEANS IN TERMS OF A BOTTOM

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:16.360

TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT IN SCHOOL

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:38.679
MENTAL HEALTH THAT WHAT WE'RE

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:40.380
HEARING IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:41.782
FOR SCHOOL AGE YOUTH TO BE

NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. AT THE

01:44:00.867 --> 01:44:02.669
SECOND ABOUT. A THIRD PROPOSAL

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:04.671
IS- WE RECENTLY LOST A

01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:06.406
COMMISSIONER SHE SHE PASSED AWAY

01:44:06.473 --> 01:44:08.809
RECENTLY AND SHE WAS A PEER. AND

01:44:08.875 --> 01:44:11.645
SHE WAS VERY UNIQUE IN THAT SHE

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:12.646
HAD WORKED FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

01:44:12.713 --> 01:44:15.115
HEALTH AND SHOULD WORK FOR THE

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:15.682
STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THAT

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:16.416
PERSPECTIVE GAVE HER A

01:44:16.483 --> 01:44:19.252
TREMENDOUS. LEVEL OF EMPATHY AND

01:44:19.319 --> 01:44:21.088
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENS IN

01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:21.655
OUR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:23.156
SYSTEM AND OUR STATEMENTS HEALTH

01:44:23.223 --> 01:44:24.958
SYSTEM. AND IT REVEALED TO US

01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:26.326
UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS HER PASSING

01:44:26.393 --> 01:44:28.128
THAT REVEALED TO US. THAT WHILE

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:29.363
THE STATE HAS MADE TREMENDOUS

01:44:29.429 --> 01:44:31.298
PROGRESS IN EMBRACING THE ROLE

01:44:31.365 --> 01:44:33.033
OF PEERS. IN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.302
HEALTH WE HAVE NOT YET DONE SO

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:37.304
IN STATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:39.272
SO THE ARGUMENT HERE IS THAT IF

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:40.574
WE REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:43.210
STATE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. CAN

01:44:43.276 --> 01:44:44.277
BE ALIGNED TO THE VERY REAL

01:44:44.344 --> 01:44:46.346
LIVED EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE WHO

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:47.547
HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THEIR MENTAL

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:49.583
HEALTH. ADDICTION AND SO FORTH

01:44:49.650 --> 01:44:51.485
THAT WE SHOULD EMBRACE PEERS NOT

01:44:51.551 --> 01:44:52.753
JUST IN OUR COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR

01:44:52.819 --> 01:44:54.154
HEALTH SYSTEM. BUT IN STATE

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:55.355
GOVERNMENT AND SO WE'RE ASKING

01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:56.390

01:45:04.364 --> 01:45:05.499
POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:45:05.565 --> 01:45:06.667
HAVE. IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:07.834
THAT WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN

01:45:07.901 --> 01:45:10.303
MAKING SURE THAT THE WORK WE DO

01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:11.371

01:53:02.408 --> 01:53:04.010
ENGAGEMENT BUT ALSO IN. THE WAY

01:53:04.077 --> 01:53:06.012
IN WHICH WE CAN ENGAGE IS SMALL

01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:09.782

THAT THEY HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO

01:53:11.918 --> 01:53:13.219
THE FUNDING AND THAT IS THAT IS

01:53:13.286 --> 01:53:14.721
REALLY OUR OUR FOCUS THEY'RE

01:53:14.787 --> 01:53:17.090
DOING THIS RIGHT BECAUSE WE

01:53:17.157 --> 01:53:20.927

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:24.364
AND I APPRECIATE WANTING TO DO

01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:26.599
IT RIGHT I THINK FOR MANY OF US

01:53:26.666 --> 01:53:28.535

VERY HIGH. IT'S BEEN

01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:21.774
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:48.568
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BUT IT HAS.

01:56:48.634 --> 01:56:50.203
FURTHER IN DINNER ABILITY. AS

01:56:50.269 --> 01:56:52.271
WELL AS WE ARE MUCH SLOWER IN

01:56:52.338 --> 01:56:53.606
GETTING INDIVIDUALS INTO THE

THEM AND TEST THEM AND SURE THAT

01:57:05.818 --> 01:57:07.420
THEY DON'T HAVE PROBABLY BEFORE

01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:08.554
WE MOVE OUT TO OUR VERY LARGE

01:57:08.621 --> 01:57:10.456
CONGREGATE ENVIRONMENT SO. IT'S

01:57:10.523 --> 01:57:11.991

HAD A CONTRACTOR ON THE UNIT

02:03:45.184 --> 02:03:48.954
ABOVE MINE THAT LEFT AND THEY

02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:49.688

UNIT NORMALLY WE HAVE TWO

02:03:59.465 --> 02:04:02.201

THIS IS KIND OF BECOMING THE

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:14.313
NORM I'M- FRANKLY I'M WE ARE

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:18.450
STILL WAITING ARM FOR SOME SORT

02:04:18.517 --> 02:04:22.021
OF- RELIEF AND WE HAVE NOT HAD

02:04:22.087 --> 02:04:26.458
ANY ARM THERE IS NO- RETENTION

02:04:26.525 --> 02:04:31.864
SORT OF. BENEFIT RIGHT NOW

02:04:31.931 --> 02:04:34.133
FRANKLY I'M LOOKING TO SEE

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.801
WHETHER IT'S WORTH FOR ME TO

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:40.940
STICK AROUND- THIS IS- THE

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:41.707
CENTURY THE WORKLOAD IS GOING

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:46.345
UP. THERE IS NO ACCESS CAPACITY-

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:49.148
YOU I NOTICE AND I JUST YOUR

02:04:49.215 --> 02:04:52.585
MISSION ABOUT I. S. TEASE HER

02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:54.286
EARLIER. I THERE IS NO CAPACITY

02:04:54.353 --> 02:04:55.988
BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE DON'T WANT

02:04:56.055 --> 02:04:58.357
TO COME AND WORK AT THE STATE

02:04:58.424 --> 02:05:00.326
HOSPITAL BECAUSE CURRENTLY. THE

02:05:00.392 --> 02:05:02.294
AMOUNT OF MONEY AND FRANKLY THE

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:04.630
RETIREMENT THAT'S BEEN

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.732
COMPLETELY GUIDED OUR- MAJOR

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:10.936
MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS I THE SOLUTION

02:05:11.003 --> 02:05:15.908
IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE- THE

02:05:15.975 --> 02:05:19.278
PSYCHIATRIST ESSENTIALLY ARM

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:22.147
WANT TO HAVE A FAIR THEIR PAY

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:24.884
AND BETTER. AT RETIREMENT

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:27.620
BENEFITS AND RIGHT NOW THOSE

02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:29.488
THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND IT'S

02:05:29.555 --> 02:05:31.357
HARDER TO GET PEOPLE BECAUSE OF

02:05:31.423 --> 02:05:33.559
THAT AND SO AS A BANDAID I THINK

02:05:33.626 --> 02:05:35.094
WITH THE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:37.196
IS DONE IS HIRE CONTRACTORS WHO

02:05:37.263 --> 02:05:39.198
ARE PAID ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH BY

02:05:39.265 --> 02:05:40.299
THE WAY- AND SO THAT'S BECOMING

02:05:40.366 --> 02:05:43.335
ANOTHER ISSUE BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE

02:05:43.402 --> 02:05:44.570
ARE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT. WHY AM

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:46.839

02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:48.107
ON AND BECOME A CONTRACTOR

02:05:48.173 --> 02:05:50.042
MYSELF WHICH SOME PEOPLE HAVE

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:53.279
DONE- SO THESE ARE THE BIG BIG

02:05:53.345 --> 02:05:55.047
ISSUES AND I THINK THE SOLUTIONS

02:05:55.114 --> 02:05:58.083
ARE RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD-

02:05:58.150 --> 02:06:01.320
I JUST HOPE THAT- THE STATE

02:06:01.387 --> 02:06:03.789
HOSPITAL SYSTEM- BARGAINS WITH

02:06:03.856 --> 02:06:05.791
