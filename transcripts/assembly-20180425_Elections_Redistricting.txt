FIRST ITEM NUMBER NINE THEN ITEM NUMBER FIVE THAT ITEM NUMBER THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS PRESENTING AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY WHICH SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC FACILITIES. REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR USE AS VOTE CENTERS THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. AS IMPLEMENTATION OF SP FOUR FIFTY THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS CHOICE ACT BEGINS THIS YEAR IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES INCLUDING MINE SAN MATEO COUNTY. AS MORE COUNTIES TRANSITION OF THE VOTES CENTER MODEL. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATORS HAVE AN ADEQUATE POOL OF POTENTIAL LOCATIONS. POR ELECTION DAY. IN THE EARLY VOTING PERIOD WHILE FEWER LOCATIONS WILL BE NEEDED ON ELECTION DAY ITSELF THE NUMBER OF LOCATIONS NEEDED DURING THAT EARLY VOTING PERIODIS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED UNDER THE SP FOUR FIFTY MODEL PUBLIC FACILITIES. INCLUDING SCHOOLS LIBRARIES COMMUNITY CENTERS AND CITY HALLS ARE IDEAL LOCATIONS FOR VOTES CENTERS BEING THAT THEY ARE QUICK WITH INTERNET AND WIFI INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY FOR ELECTRONIC VOTING EQUIPMENT. THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE AND VOTERS ARE GENERALLY FAMILIAR WITH WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SUCH FACILITIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY SERVICE POLLING PLACES UNDER THE CURRENT ELECTION MODEL AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY WOULD INSURE THAT THE SAME LOCATIONS REMAIN AVAILABLE DURING THE EARLY VOTING. UNDER THE NEW VOTES CENTER MODEL. WITHOUT A RELIABLE POOL OF AVAILABLE LOCATIONS ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATORS MAY STRUGGLE THE FIND ENOUGH LOCATIONS ARE HAVE TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ON OTHER COMMERCIAL LOCATIONS. TWENTY FIVE FORTY WILL PROVIDE ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATORS WITH MORE RESOURCES AND ULTIMATELY MAKE CERTAIN THAT VOTERS HAVE ACCESS TO VOTE CENTERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH ME TODAY HAVE LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGISTRAR RECORDER COUNTY CLERK DIEM LOGAN.

THIS IS REALLY ABOUT REALIZING THE BENEFITS OF THE VOTER CHOICE ACT IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE TO SELL THESE THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE CONVENIENT AND VISIBLE FOR VOTERS WHEN WE MOVE TO TO THIS MODEL. AS YOU ALL KNOW THERE'S GROWING PRESSURE FOR ELECTION ADMINISTRATORS THE CALIFORNIA TO SECURE LOCATIONS FOR POLLING PLACES ABOUT SENATE'S. UNLIKE POLLING PLACES TO GENERALLY OPEN ONLY ONE DAY UNDER THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT WE ARE LOOKING FOR LOCATIONS CONSENT CASES WILL BE OPEN FOR ELEVEN DAYS OTHERS THAT WILL BE OPEN FOR FOUR DAYS.

WHEN CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE THANKS KEVIN MCKINLEY I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR FAIRS WITH INTERNET ASSOCIATION. JUST GRABBED MICHAEL OF THE BANK OF THE AUTHORS OFFICE THE SPONSOR AND COMMITTEE STAFF. THINK OF DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB GETTING THE BILL WHERE IT IS. WE STILL HAVE SOME ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT THE. MECHANICS AND SOME OF THE USER INTERFACE THE WAY THAT. IT'S LEGISLATED IN THE LANGUAGE AND WE THINK THAT THE BIG ISSUES SURROUNDING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ADVERTISER IN THE PLATFORM WHICH REALLY THAT. THE TOUGH STUFF IS WORKED OUT. AND SO WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE PLACE ON THIS BILL WHICH NOT QUITE THERE YET. BUT AGAIN THANK YOU GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES EITHER NEUTRAL OR IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. WITH A MOTION AND A SECOND AND I'LL BRING BACK TO COLLEGE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AYE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE A GROUPS THAT ADVERTISE ON FACEBOOK OR TWITTER I TO INCLUDE A LINK ON THEIR WILL ON A WEB PAGE. WHICH IS LINKED FROM THAT OUT ITSELF. WHICH SHOWS THAT THE OTHER ADS FROM THE PAST YEAR IS WELL IT'S INFORMATION FROM EACH THE OTHER RATS INCLUDING TARGETED AUDIENCE THE TARGET AUDIENCE. NUMBER VIEWS AND THE AVERAGE RATE CHARGE FOR THE ADD ON ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WAS IS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT. THIS ISN'T EVEN REGARD BROUGHT REQUIRED OF. PRINT ADVERTISEMENTS AURA OR MAILERS OR SUCH BY THIS KIND OF CATALOGING. THAT'S. REQUIRED FOR UP FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO OUT TO VIEW I IN FACT CAMPAIGNS MAY BE TARGETING. THEIR COMMUNICATION FROM ONE GROUP VERSUS THE OTHER AYE INTENDING IT TO BE TAILORED AND SPECIFIC A TO THAT GROUP. I SO SO THE QUESTION I REQUEST I'M GONNA HAVE FIRST IS ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHY FOR THIS AND NOT FOR US. NOT FROM IN PRINT I IS THIS MEANT TO BE PERMANENT AYE IS THERE A TIME WHEN THE CAMPAIGN OR THE SOCIAL MEDIA. IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO. TO PURGE THIS AYE IN WHO'S RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING THAT CATALOGING IS THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITE OR IS IT THE CANDIDATES. NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THERE LET ME LET ME TRY TO ADD A TACKLE THAT THE TOP LINE HERE WHICH IS THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTAIN AS AN ESSENTIALLY DATABASE A TELEVISION OR RADIO MEDIA COMPANIES. WITH REGARD TO WHOSE PURCHASING OUR ADVERTISEMENTS THIS WAS SIMPLY APPLY THOSE SAME REGULATIONS OF VIA THAT TWO FORTY NINE AS IT APPLIED TO. TELEVISION OR RADIO OF MEDIA TO SOCIAL MEDIA BUT I WILL ALLOW TRENT TO COMMENT ON YOUR QUESTION AROUND PRINT MEDIA WHAT SOME OF THE DISTINCTIONS ARE BUT I THINK THAT. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE BILL THAT DOESN'T. YOU REALLY GET THE HEADLINES YA THE TOP THREE FUNDERS FINDING THE TRUTH. DISCLSING THE TRUE FUNDERS AT SO IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO READ I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. FOR JOURNALISTS TO BE ABLE TO CLICK AND SEE THAT IN AGGREGATE WHO WHERE THE MONEY IS MOVING AND SOCIAL MEDIA WHO'S TRYING TO INFLUENCE ADVERTISEMENT SO I THINK THIS IS A KEY PIECE OF THE BILL BUT I WILL LET TRENT ADDRESS SOME OF THE. PARTICULARS WITH THAT QUESTION. AT THANK YOU ARE ARMED YET THIS IS A KEY PIECE OF THE BILL AS AS WRITTEN DRAFT IS INTENDED TO BE THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THAT HAVE TO KEEP THE THAT THE DATABASE. THE BILL REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE A A LINK ON THEIR ON THAT SO THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM TO PUT A VIEW ADS OR SIMILAR SORT OF LINK. ON THE. PROFILE PAID THAT THAT THEY HOPE THEY DO THE LAYOUT PEOPLE CONTENT BUT. FACEBOOK DOES THE LAYOUT THAT WOULD GO TO THE DATABASE OF ADS PAID FOR BY THE COMMITTEE AGAIN THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT IN FACT FACEBOOK IS. PROPOSING TO ROLLOUTS A A SIMILAR DATABASE NATIONWIDE FOR. FOR. ARE ALL ADVERTISING AND SO THIS FITS IN KIND RIGHT EXACTLY WITHOUT THAT APPLIED TO ALL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IF NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMITTEE TO KEEP THAT DATABASE WOULD BE THIS RESPONSIBILITY THE PLATFORM WHICH. FACEBOOK'S ARE INTENDING TO DO. SO ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS. IS THIS REALLY RESTRICTED TO ONLY FACEBOOK AND TWITTER BECAUSE. OTHERS. PIC BECAUSE OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WHETHER INSTAGRAM OR SNAPCHAT. BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY UP PREDECESSORS I THERE ARE STILL A IN EXISTENCE BLOCKS. A IC'S SOCIAL MEDIA IS WELL AND THERE'S OFTEN BEEN A QUESTION OF. ARE BLOGGERS PAID. ARE THE YOU KNOW GETTING THEIR. THEIR THEIR FUNDS AND NOT. DISCLOSING FLORIDA THEY ACTUALLY I GOT PAID I CAMPAIGN OPERATIVES UP OR THE JOURNALISTS IN THIS IS WHERE THIS. SPECTRUM. THE LINES SEEM KIND OF BLURRED AS YOU GET FROM TWITTER AND SNAPCHAT I'D TO BLOGS TO THE NEW YORK TIMES A LOS ANGELES TIMES DOT COM. A WHO IS THE SOURCE ARE OR WHO IS THE IMPETUS OFFER AN EDITORIAL OR AN OPINION PIECE I THAT THAT THEY INDEED PUBLISH. WELL I THINK THE AND THE INTENT. THE INTENT OF THE FOCUS BY THE BILL WAS THE MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES WHERE MUCH OF THE POLITICAL MONEY NEW POLITICAL MONEY IS MOVING WITH REGARD TO S. STATEWIDE BALLOT MEASURES WE HAD BILLION DOLLARS. SPENT IN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN ON ON STATEWIDE BALLOT MEASURES I EXPECT MUCH OF THAT MONEY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY AND BEYOND WILL BE MOVING INTO. A FACEBOOK AND TWITTER BUT THOUGH THE WAY THE BILL'S CRAFTED IT'S PROBABLY APPLICABLE TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM IN GENERAL BUT YOU RAISE AN INTERESTING. ISSUE MISTER HARPER AYE I WANT TO AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. WILL MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S CLARITY ON DEFINITIONS AROUND SOCIAL MEDIA MY GOAL IS BROADLY APPLICABLE. AND AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE CAPTURING. THAT INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS BUT WEEKEND I'M FINE TUNE SOME OF THAT OF LANGUAGE IN TRENTON ENOUGH YOU WANT TO ADD ADDITIONAL CHARGES AT A THE COUPLE WORDS HERE SO THE. THE VERSION IN PRINT HAS A THRESHOLD THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL ANA STATS ACTIVE FIFTEEN A ANY SORT REDUCE PLAQUE FROM THE POSTS ADDS. THAT HAS FIFTY MILLION OR MORE A UNIQUE VISITORS PER MONTH. THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THAT WITH OUR. A NEGOTIATIONS WITH THAT FACEBOOK AND INTERNET ASSOCIATION WERE TAKEN TO AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD I THINK CLARIFY THE QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE. ONE IS TO REMOVE THE THRESHOLD SO IT'S NOT ONLY FIFTY MILLION OR MORE IT WOULD APPLY TO SOME OF THOSE. OTHER ONES. OF THE SPLIT SMALLER THE OLDER ONES ISSUES AS YOU SAID AT SECONDLY TO CLARIFY THAT IT'S IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT BY IT IF A BLOG POST GOOGLE ADS SECULAR REPLY TO GOOGLE ADS AS WELL AS AN ONLINE PLATFORM OUR YAHOO AFTER SOME OTHER AT. IT'S IT'S THE A RESPONSIBILITY THE ONLINE PLATFORM THAT INTERACTS WITH THE ADVERTISER THE TAKES THEIR INFORMATION SO AN ADVERTISER WILL GO TO GOOGLE AT AND SAY. DO THIS ADDON DO NOT THAT DESPITE ALL BUT DIFFERENT BLOCKS IN THE BLOCKS WILL. GIVE A BANK TO GOOGLE ADS IN GOOGLE. WILL GIVE THEM A CUT BASICALLY BUT NEVER TO THE BLOG OUR WEBSITE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AT ALL ABOUT THE AT THEY DON'T INTERACT WITH THE ADVERTISER SO. THOUGH CLARIFYING LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU HAVE NOW. CLARIFIES THAT SELLS ADVERTISERS APPLIES TO THOSE THAT DIRECTLY THAT PLATFORMS THAT DIRECTLY INTERACT WITH THE ADVERTISERS NOT THE. NOT THOSE SMALL BLOGS THAT THAT AREN'T DEALING WITH THEM AND DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. BUT THAT WOULD ALSO COVER. OTHER THINGS SO FOR INSTANCE THE I KNOW FOR A FACT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ADVERTISING. IN HOUSE SO THEY INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH ADVERTISERS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES. TAKES ADDS THEY WOULD HAVE TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION AND AND DISPLAYED IT JUST TO CLARIFY I'M NOT. TALKING ABOUT THE ADS I'M TALKING ABOUT CLONE EYES. CONTENT THAT REALLY MAYBE ACTS BUT IT'S MATT MASQUERADING AS CONTENT THAT'S FROM BLOGS THAT'S FROM AYE MEDIA AND I'M NOT SURE WHY WE SHOULD GIVE. QUOTE STANDARD MEDIA A PASS. WHEN WE'RE TARGETING SOCIAL MEDIA. A IF THAT THE VALUABLE POINT THAT THAT'S BILL IS NOT MEANT TO ADDRESS THAT IT'S MEANT TO ADDRESS PAID POLITICAL ADVERTISING AS DEFINED IN CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. AND THE THE LAST THING I THAT I WANTED TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE. A FOLK CENTER WHO WAS I CAME UP I'VE ALLUDED TO THIS POINT THOUGHT ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF FOREIGN MONEY. AYE AND. WHETHER THERE IS INDEED A RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE SIX OUTRAGE AND I WILL POINT OUT. THAT THE LAST YEAR I INTRODUCED I AB SEVEN FORTY FOUR WHICH WERE PREVENT FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS FOREIGN PRINCIPLES LIVING ABROAD IN FOREIGN NATIONALS LIVING INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. FOR MAKINGA CONTRIBUTION IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FIT STATE FEDERAL OR LOCAL CANDIDATE FOR ELECTION A BALLOT MEASURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT MEASURE. I WAS DEFEATED HERE IN THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE ON A PARTY LINE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OR GOVERNMENTS. GREAT SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MISTER MULLIN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. JUST AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR. THE EXCELLENT WORK ON THIS MIGHT THINK IT A TREND AND HIS CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN FOLKS WHO ARE REALLY UP PUTTING SOME MUSCLE ON THE GRASSROOTS BEHIND THIS EFFORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OR THINK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE AMENDMENTS A TO THIS BILL WHICH WILL A MOCKUP OF BUT WILL BE FINALIZED AND THE DAYS TO COME. GIVEN THE INCREASING ROLE THAT ADVERTISING ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS PLAYING IN CAMPAIGNS THIS BILL WILL BUILD ON LAST YEAR'S DISCLOSE ACT. KEEP CALIFORNIA AT THE FOREFRONT OF CAMPAIGN TRANSPARENCY. TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS TIME TO FINE TUNE THE LANGUAGE IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN WE WON'T BE AMENDING THE BILL IN COMMITTEE TODAY AS ALREADY MENTIONED. WELL SKIP THIS PART WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING I RECOMMEND AND I VOTE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN AYE.

ON TO ADVANCE THE IDEA IN THE POLICY OF DOING RISK LIMITING AUDITS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE AUDITS BASED STATISTICALLY MEANINGFUL AND RELEVANT DATA THAT ACTUALLY AUDITS THE OUTCOME OF ELECTIONS NOT JUST THE ACCURACY OF THE EQUIPMENT USED TO TO COUNT THE BALLOTS. UP WE HAVE AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID WE'VE SPENT MANY HOURS IN MEETINGS ON THIS IT'S A COMPLICATED THE TECHNICAL TOPIC I AM PLEASED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT WE HAVE WORKED. VERY CLOSELY WITH A DISTINGUISHED. GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS AND WHO CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND WHO ARE ONLINE THAT WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCURACY VALUES OF THIS INITIATIVE. AND OTHER NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT ARE READY TO GO ON THIS BILL THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ITEMS WERE STILL WORKING ON WE'RE MEETING AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON THAT I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE. WILL I'M COME TOGETHER ON A BILL THAT WE CAN STAND UNITED ON AND THAT WILL MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD THAT THE CHALLENGE WITH A BILL LIKE THIS IS WE WANT TO. ADVANCE THE IDEA OF RISK LIMITING OUT ITS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS COUNTIES THAT ARE READY TO MOVE FORWARD IN THAT TO LEAD THE WAY THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF COURSE IS FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO THE STATEWIDE AND TO BE ABLE TO DO. WITH WINNING OUT ITS ON THE OUTCOMES OF STATEWIDE CONTEST AND STATEWIDE MEASURES AYE BUT WE HAVE TO NAVIGATE THE. A LOCAL MANDATE LANGUAGE AND THEY THAT THE FISCAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO THE BILL BEFORE YOU. ARE ALLOWS COUNTIES THAT ARE READY TO MOVE FORWARD IN THAT I WE THINK THAT THAT WILL BE USEFUL IN AND ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING BEST PRACTICES AND POLICIES. I ALLOWS THE SECRETARY OF STATE AUTHORIZES SECRETARY OF STATE TO. I'M SET COMMON GUIDELINES AROUND THAT AND A WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN THE AMENDMENTS COMING FORWARD ARE VERY CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF VERY CLEAR STATED THRESHOLD FOR THE RISK LIMITING AUDITS. AND. A PATH FORWARD THAT WE THINK POSITIONS CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER ON THIS AYE IN THE NATION SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND LOOK FORWARD TO. WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK AND THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE AND OUR STAKEHOLDER PARTNERS SOUND TO SEE THIS. THEME SILICON. GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN CHAIR IN MEMBERS.

AT GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS TIFFANY MARK ON BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE AL EXPEDIENCY PORT. THANKS DIFFERENT. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND THE. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OR ANY NEUTRALS. BUT. AND CHAIR BERMAN MEMBERS NICOLAS ITEM WITH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE. WE WERE CURRENTLY NEUTRON THE BILL BUT WE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS RISK LIMITING AUDITS. A RISK LIMITING AUDITS ARE FORMER ACTOR WAYS IN THE ONE PERCENT MENTAL TALLY TO ENSURE THE. ACCURACY OF OUR VOTE COUNTING MACHINES. AND GENERALLY RESULTING FAR FEWER BALLOTS BEING COUNTED SO IT'S ALSO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING SO. WE ARE CURRENTLY NEUTRAL ON THE BILL BUT THE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT AND. CERTAINLY VERY PERCEPTIVE OF THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR WORKING WITH US. AS WELL SEE CO WE'VE HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS I THINK WERE REALLY GETTING CLOSE TO HAVING. POSITION THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON. WITH THE AMENDMENT CERTAINLY COMING FOR WE THINK THERE ARE VERY MANY POSITIVE ELEMENTS INCLUDING A PATH TO. HOPEFULLY EASING IMPLEMENTATION INTO THIS AS WELL AS SOME REAL STRONG PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE FOR EXAMPLE A HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE WHEN OUR LEASE PERFORMED FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT OFTEN. THERE ARE STILL SOME ELEMENTS THAT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THEY WERE WORKING THROUGH THE AUTHOR AND AND SEE CO. I'D NOTABLY THE IMAGE TO USE A BALLOT IMAGES WHICH I'VE. TO BE DONE WITH THE TO PERFORM THE OUR LOW USING BALLOT IMAGE IT'S ONE TALK ABOUT THAT VERY BRIEFLY. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE USE IN OUR LA IS TO VERIFY WITH A PHYSICAL BALLOT. LEAVE THE CASTRO RECORD WITH MACHINES ARE SAYING THE VOTE TALLY IS IF YOU RELY ON A DIGITAL PERSON TO VERIFY THAT. IT'S SUSCEPTIBLE TO POTENTIALLY THE SAME TYPE OF A POTENTIALLY HACKING THAT WERE TRYING TO GUARD AGAINST WHEN WE ACTUALLY GO BACK FISCAL ABOUT. SUCH AN ISSUE OF CONCERN BUT IT'S ONE THAT WE'VE HAD WONDERFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH CCO ON. AND SO OVERALL I WOULD SAY I'M VERY POSITIVE THERE WHERE THIS IS GOING CERTAINLY URGE THE BILL TO BE. VOTED OUT OF COMMITTEE SO THAT THIS CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE AND AGAIN THANKS TO THE THE AUTHOR FOR HIS. UP LEADERSHIP ON THIS WORKING WITH US BUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI GOOD MORNING KIM ALEXANDER WITH A CALIFORNIA VOTER FOUNDATION AYE WE ARE HOPING TO SUPPORT THE SPELL IN ITS CURRENT. GUIDE STATUS WE COULD NOT AYE WE WOULD OPPOSE IT BUT WE DO KNOW THERE. ARE AMENDMENTS IN THE WORKS AND WE ARE ENGAGING IN THAT PROCESS I'M AYE ONE ECHO WHAT NICHOLAS SAID ABOUT. BALLOT IMAGES THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING STRUGGLE IN ELECTION VERIFICATION IN CALIFORNIA'S STARTING WITH PAPERLESS ELECTRONIC VOTING THAT WAS INTRODUCED AND OUR STATE STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND ONE. THAT AYE NEGATED AYE THE ABILITY TO TRULY CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT WE GOT RID OF THAT WE REQUIRED A PAPER TRAIL THAT WE HAD A PASS AND OTHER LAW SAYING YOU HAVE TO USE THE PAPER TRAIL TO DO THE AUDIT. ON SO WE HAD TO KEEP GOING BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY AUDITING.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS I'M THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONFERENCE OF THEN DOUBLE ACP THANK YOU FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY. HOUSE SPEAKER BRIEFLY ABOUT THREE REASONS WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. FIRST ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL STAY. LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS THIS OWN PROGRAM IN PLACE AND IT HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM.

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TENS OF THOUSANDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN COUNTY JAILS. AND MANY MORE WHO HAVE BEEN IN INCARCERATED AT ONE POINT.

GOOD MORNING LOSE MARA MIND ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB THIRTY ONE FIFTEEN. LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES EACH COUNTY JAIL TO ALLOW ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE VOTER EDUCATION PROGRAMS THIS BILL TOUCHES ON THE PASSIONATE PRIOR THE OF THE LEAK. VOTING IS A FUNDAMENTAL CITIZEN RIGHT THAT MUST BE GUARANTEED. AND EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE. WE SUPPORT MEASURES THAT WILL ENSURE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THIS RIGHT THE REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES THAT IN COURAGE AND. AN INFORMED AND ACTIVE ELECTORATE. IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE ONE MUST BE A U. S. CITIZEN OF IS A RESIDENT OF THE STATE AND EIGHTEEN YEARS OR OLDER ON ELECTION DAY. MANY WHO ARE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS AND ARE ELIGIBLE TO REGISTER AND VOTE. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER A GIPSON HEAD CALIFORNIAN CAR STATE EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN ITS JAILS AND MORE THAN HALF. OF THE PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OR REMAIN ON SENTENCE. DUE TO EITHER MISINFORMATION OR LACK OF INFORMATION MANY WHO ARE BEHIND BARS DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY CAN REGISTER TO VOTE OR THERE ARE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS IN PLACE. THAT DO NOT ALLOW THESE PEOPLE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT. WE BELIEVE VOTER EDUCATION IS CRUCIAL FOR ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS AND RUSHED AND RESIDENTS. AND IT IS WHY WE SO STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK YOU THINK YOU VERY MUCH.

THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT STATE LAWS GOVERNING VOTING RIGHTS AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAVE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. SO PROVIDING ACCURATE INFORMATION AND VOTER EDUCATION IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT TO ADDRESS THE SECURITY CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AYE AND WITHOUT AMENDMENT I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PROCESS AMENDED AND WE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN AYE AYE BERMAN AYE HARPER. HARPER KNOW CALDERON. CALDERON AYE KNOW. LOW AYE MULLIN. OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE YES NO WEBER. WEBER I IS A THAT BILLS THAT WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH. AND THANK YOU AND NEXT UP WE HAVE IS MR ROW HERE WE HAVE MISTER CHOI. I WAS ROSE HERE WHERE. HOPE I DON'T SEE THEIR SORRY SIR. WE HAVE MISTER BOROUGH WITH. ITEM NUMBER SIX AB TWENTY TO THIRTY ONE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. BUT IN THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT PERVERTED PRESERVING A FLOATING FORMAT WHICH RESULTS IN POLARIZED VOTING IS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW. NOTHING IN AB TWENTY TO THIRTY ONE WILL CHANGE THAT IN THIS BILLS INTENT IS NOT TO UNDERMINE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AS A PROTECT AGAINST POLARIZED VOTING IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT AS A SIMPLE ONE SIZE FITS ALL REMEDY. EXPRESSLY IDENTIFIES DISTRICT ELECTIONS IS ONE OF THE CLEAR AVAILABLE REMEDIES AND WHILE ADOPTING A BY DISTRICT ELECTED ORDINANCE AS A LAWFULLY CRAFTED ELECTION DISTRICT IS A CONVENIENT RESPONSE. IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE SOLUTION THAT SOLVES A PARTICULAR ISSUE PRESENT WITHIN A CITY EACH CITY IS DIFFERENT WITH DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHY IN DIFFERENT LOCAL OBJECTIVES CURRENT LAW FOR TO CITY A SMALL WINDOW OF TIME TO CONSIDER NECESSARY CHANGES TO THE ELECTION SYSTEM AND RECENTLY. THIS COMMITTEE PASS AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE TO STAND THAT TIME FRAME. BUT WITHOUT FIRST ADDRESSING THE BASIS FOR WHICH THE VIOLATION OCCURS OR THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE PUBLIC AGENCIES WILL SIMPLY. TRANSITION TO BUY DISTRICT ELECTION PROCESS. AS IS IS PRESS WE IDENTIFIED AND IS THE MOST COMMON REACTION BY A CITY. A FAIR AND EQUAL REPRESENTATION REPRESENTATION IS NOT ALWAYS ENSURE BY DISTRICT ELECTION PROCESS. RATHER THAN ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE UNDER THE THREAT OF LITIGATION. THROUGH THE STANDARDS IN THIS BILL THEN IN SOME WAY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS NEED OPTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE THOUGHTFUL AND EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TAKE XIN. TOWARD AN AFFAIR IDENTIFY THE NECESSARY ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES TO A VOTING RIGHTS ACT VIOLATION. AB TWENTY TO THIRTY ONE SEEKS TO PROVIDE ACTUAL AND BENEFICIAL SOLUTIONS THAT WILL HELP RESOLVE THE POLARIZATION FACTORS PRESENT WITHIN COMMUNITIES. MISTER CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SCOTT SAYS BILL. AND. WITH ME TODAY IS COREY WILLIAMS ARE FROM TOWNS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF MISSION VIEJO THERE'S THE BILL SPONSORED. THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE MOTION AND A SECOND MAN THINK HE'LL PUBLIC AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE FACED RECENT LAWSUITS ALLEGING THAT THE OUT LARGE. ELECTION PROCESS VIOLATES THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT BY DILUTING THE MINORITY VOTES ALMOST ALL OF THESE PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE SETTLE CLAIMS OUT OF THE COURT BY VOLUNTARILY SHIFTING TO DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS. THE CITY OF MISSION VIEJO WAS RECENTLY FACED WITH THIS LAWSUIT ASSERTING THAT THE CITY'S OUT LARGE ELECTORAL SYSTEM DILUTES THE ABILITY OF LATINOS TO ELECT CANDIDATES OF THEIR CHOICE. ARTS OTHERWISE INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS. A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW OF ALL VOTING PATTERNS DATING BACK TO TWENTY TEN AND FOX SHOWS EVIDENCE OF RACIALLY POLARIZED VOTING IN MISSION VIEJO. HOWEVER IT ALSO SHOWS THAT DISTRICT ELECTION MAPPING WOULD NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY TO RESPOND TO THE RACIALLY POLARIZED VOTING. ADOPTING OF BY DISTRICT ELECTION ORDINANCE THAT PUTS INTO PLACE LAWFULLY CRAFTED ELECTION DISTRICTS IS A CONVENIENT RESPONSE BUT NOT ALWAYS THE SOLUTION THAT ACTUALLY SOLVES RACIALLY POLARIZED VOTING. AND ENSURES THAT ALL MEMBERS OF THE CITY INCLUDING MINORITY GROUPS ARE FAIRLY REPRESENTED. THE OPPOSITION WILL STATE THAT THIS BILL IS COUNTER TO CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CONVERT TO DISTRICTS BASED ELECTIONS. THIS IS NOT TRAIL WE FULLY SUPPORT DISTRICT ELECTIONS IF IT WILL SOLVE THE ISSUE OF DILUTING THE MINORITY VOTES HOWEVER AGAIN DISTRICT ELECTIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS A REAL SOLUTION TO THIS VERY REAL PROBLEM. EACH CITY IS DIFFERENT WITH DIFFERENT POPULATIONS DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHY AND DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS THERE'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. AB TWENTY TO THIRTY ONE WILL DEVELOP A MORE STRINGENT STANDARD FOR VOTING RIGHTS ACT VIOLATIONS TO ASSURE A FAIR AND UNBIASED ELECTION AND TO ENSURE THAT MINORITY GROUPS ARE APPROPRIATELY REPRESENTED. AND SAID OF ATTEMPTING TO THAT RESOLVE THE THREAT OF LITIGATION WITH THE REACTIVE HASTY SOLUTION THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT MINORITY GROUPS ARE REPRESENTED BY ENSURING THAT A THOUGHTFUL EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TAKEN TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. AB TWENTY TO THIRTY ONE DOES IMPOSE A HIGHER STANDARD TO ENSURE THAT SOLUTIONS WILL PROVIDE ACTUAL AND BENEFICIAL RESULTS THAT WILL HELP RESOLVE THE POLARIZATION FACTORS PRESENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE OXFORD YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLAYING GRAM LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA GOOD MORNING. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE SPELL BECAUSE OF SNIFFING CAN CHANGES IN THE LEGAL STANDARDS AND REMEDIES AVAILABLE UNDER THE CVR A. AND BECAUSE OF THE CHILLING EFFECT THE CHANGE IN THE ATTORNEY FEES PROVISION COULD HAVE ON CVR A PLAINTIFFS BRING IN THEIR CASES. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS COUNTER TO THE INTENT OF THE CVR A WHICH WAS ENACTED TO ALLOW. CHALLENGES TO DISCRIMINATORY VOTING AND RACIALLY POLARIZED VOTING. DAVID THIS BILL MAKES FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE LEGAL STANDARDS ON FOR PREVAILING ON CBR. CBR A CLAIMS IT REQUIRES A PLAINTIFF TO. DEMONSTRATE ALL THREE OF THE LEGAL PRECONDITIONS WHEN THE CVR I CURRENTLY ONLY REQUIRES TO. THIS CHANGES A CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE CVR A WHICH WAS TO ALLOW THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AT LARGE ELECTIONS ABRIDGED OR DILUTED THE RIGHTS OF VOTERS. FROM THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED. IT ALSO CONTAINS A PROBLEMATIC SHIFT IN THE REMEDIES UNDER THE SEA VERY NOW ONLY THE COURT CAN IMPOSE REMEDIES THIS ALLOWS THE VIOLIN TEEN VIOLATED ENTITY. TO IMPLEMENT ITS OWN REMEDIES AND THE BILL IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE VIOLIN AND TO DATE COULD DO SO OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF PLAINTIFFS THAT PREVAILED OR THE COURT. MAY ALSO THINK THAT THE SHIFT IN THE ATTORNEY'S FEES COULD CHILL PLAINTIFFS ABILITY TO BRING THESE CASES ON THAT RECEIVE ER. AND FORCE THEM TO MOVE TO HAVING TO BRING CLAIMS UNDER THE MORE CUMBERSOME AND BURDENSOME AND COSTLY FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AND THIS BILL IS COUNTER TO THE BIPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS OVER THE PAST YEARS TO BOTH EXPAND. WHAT JURISDICTIONS CAN MOVED OUT DISTRICT ELECTIONS AND TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO IMPLEMENT AND DISTRICT ELECTIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON THE SPELL? THANK YOU. COURTING MY NAME'S DOOR ROSE I AM DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH LEGAL MATTERS VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY WE ARE YEAR INDEED TO OPPOSE. AB TWO TO THREE ONE. THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS INTENDED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF RACIALLY POLARIZED VOTING IN VOTE DILUTION. OF. TO PROVIDE COMMUNITIES WITH THE ABILITY TO READ TOOK TO ELECT REPRESENTATIVES THAT WOULD REALLY REFLECT THE NEEDS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES TO EXPAND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY THAT'S THE POINT OF IT. THIS BILL UNDERMINES A OF THE INTENTION OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT. IT CURRENTLY TO MAKE OUT A CVR A CASE A A POLITICALLY COAST COHESIVE MINORITY IS GOT TO BE ABLE TO SHOW. THAT THERE IS RACIALLY POLARIZED VOTING AMONG THE MAJORITY COMMUNITY RIGHT. AB TWO TO THREE ONE A SUPER CHARGES THAT BURDEN OF PROOF IT SUPERCHARGES THE BURDEN OF PROOF IT REQUIRES THE PLAINTIFFS SHOW AS A THRESHOLD MATTER. THAT THERE IS A GEOGRAPHIC COMPACTNESS OR THEY COULD BE GEOGRAPHIC COMPACTNESS AMONG THE. MINORITY A DISTRICT THE CBR A WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED IN CONTRAST WITH FEDERAL LAW. RIGHT WE AT WHICH WORDS YOU WOULD OF A. THIS BILL TRIES TO PULL US BACK INTO IN CONTRAST WITH FEDERAL LAW TO ENSURE THAT GEOGRAPHICAL COMPACTNESS IS NOT A PART OF MAKING A THRESHOLD CASE IT'S NOT A BAR. TO BRINGING A A CVR A CASE IT IS A A COMPONENT IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT A A REMEDY IS APPROPRIATE. THAT'S WHERE IT BELONGS BUT NOT AS A BAR TO BRING THE CASE UP IN THE INITIAL CIRCUMSTANCE. THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES THIS THIS SCHEME WHEREBY PLAINTIFFS SEEKING INJUNCTIVE NOT MONETARY RELIEF WOULD. AND YOU ARE UNABLE TO MEET THIS NEW THIS. BURDENSOME BURDEN OF PROOF. WOULD HAVE TO PAY GOVERNMENT ATTORNEY FEES CLEARLY THAT. SHIFTING OF ATTORNEY FEES IT IS DESIGNED TO HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON PLAINTIFFS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE LEGITIMATELY. NEED TO BRING A CD ARE A CASE TO ADDRESS A THE DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT OF LOCAL ELECTIONS. LEAGUE SUPPORTS UP PLANS TO PROTECT AGAINST DILUTING THE VOTING STRENGTH OF LINGUISTIC AND RACIAL MINORITIES WE OPPOSE. ARE AB TWO TO THREE ONE STRONGLY. BECAUSE OF BY IMPOSING THESE DRACONIAN HURDLES TO SEE VERY LITIGATION BY CREATING THESE UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY BURDENSOME PROSPECTIVE PLAINTIFFS. THE BILL'S GOING TO IMPEDE REALLY CRITICAL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ACHIEVE REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HEARING CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. JANET SITE BUT THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF MULTI OF MEXICAN AMERICAN LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND ALSO IN STRONG OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS CITED. I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO NOTE THAT. THIS BILL DOES HAVE SEVERAL CHILLING EFFECT SMALL DEFENSE ONE OF ONE OF A HANDFUL OF OF ORGANIZATIONS HERE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT BRING SEE VERY CLAIMS AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. HAVE ABOUT WHAT EFFECT THIS WILL HAVE A MONTH FOR COMMUNITIES OF FOR PLAINTIFFS WHO UP HAPPEN RIGHT WHO HAVE BEEN. PRETTY MUCH LEFT OUT OF THE VOTING SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT. UMPS SOME JURISDICTIONS CONTINUE TO I'M EITHER USE THAT LARGE ELECTIONS OR CONTINUE TO DILUTE ON. MINORITY OUT VOTING THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SINGING NINE AGAIN VERY BACK TO COLLEGE FROM QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE OF ADVICE YOUR HARPER. NO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION SO I'D DO MY DUTY CO YOU. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. A PLAINTIFF SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVE THAT A SWITCHED TO BUY DISTRICT ELECTIONS WOULD BE BETTER THE FOR A PROTECTED CLASS. BEFORE FORCING AS CITY TO MOVE TO DISTRICT ELECTIONS. I THINK THE LEGAL STANDARDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE OF THE CVR A ADEQUATELY PROTECT BOTH INTERESTS AND PUTT. THE PROPER BURDEN ON THE PLAINTIFFS IN MAKING THEIR CASE TO PREVAIL. ALRIGHT ARM I I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THAT AND TO THE EVIDENCE IS ON MY SIDE BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE SEEING AN EXPLOSION OF WHAT I WOULD CALL FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AGAINST CITIES AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. THAT ARE ATTEMPTING TO FORCE TO MOVE THEM TO AT LARGE ELECTIONS FROM MY DISTRICT ELECTIONS I'VE SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. THAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE I THAT'S THE CITY THAT I LIVE IN THE CITY OF BIG BEAR LAKE. IDEAS. HAS KIND OF A PARTICULAR PROBLEM WE HAVE BY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSING STOCK UP THERE IS SECOND HOMES BECAUSE WERE VACATION DESTINATION SO THE FULL TIME POPULATION THE VOTING POPULATION OF THE IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE SMALL. ABOUT SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT A CITY COUNCIL ELECTION LOOKS LIKE IN THAT CITY. IF YOU HAVE A FOUR THOUSAND OF THOSE PEOPLE REGISTERED TO VOTE AND YOU HAVE A AND A GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION MAYBE. THIRTY OR FORTY PERCENT VOTER TURNOUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT ARE VOTING IN ELECTIONS WHICH IS INCREDIBLY SMALL. THEY RECENTLY GOT A LETTER. FROM A PREDATORY LAW FIRM AND ARE RATHER THAN BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO FIGHT IT AND HAVEN'T LOOKED AT PRESIDENT THEY. CONCLUDED THAT NO CITY THEIR SIZE COULD WIN. A CHALLENGE. UNDER THE CVR A. AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT A PROTECTED CLASSES RIGHTS WERE BEING VIOLATED AND YOU KNOW HAVING LIVED IN THAT CITY I I'D SHARE THEIR OPINION THAT. THERE'S NO VIOLATION OF A PROTECTED. CLASS BUT. BUT THEY THEY CONCLUDED THEY COULDN'T FIGHT IT IT NEVER FINANCIAL RESOURCES DO SO THEY'RE GOING TO DISTRICT pTHAT SO FIFTEEN OTHER PEOPLE VOTE NOW THEY HAVE FIVE DISTRICTS SO THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE. ARE VOTING IN EACH DISTRICT AND IT REQUIRES FIFTY PERCENT TO GET ELECTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE ARE ELECTING A CITY COUNCILMAN. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. OUR IT LEADS TO A COUPLE OF UNIQUE PROBLEMS FIRST OF ALL EVERYONE IN THE CITY NOW FEELS DISENFRANCHISED BECAUSE WHEREAS BEFORE THEY HAD A SAY. IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE ENTIRE COUNCIL NOW THEY ONLY HAVE A SAY IN THE COMPOSITION OF ONE. COUNCIL SEAT SO THAT'S ONE PROBLEM FOR LARGER PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS EVEN FINING PEOPLE. OF THOSE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WHO WHO WANT TO SERVE ON CITY COUNCIL YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PUT THEMSELVES OUT THERE AND. SERVE IN PUBLIC OFFICE AND SO. WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO TALK PEOPLE INTO RUNNING. I WHICH IS COMPLETELY COUNTER TO A FREE DEMOCRACY AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MULTIPLE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF HAVING. A. A OF ELECTION BY ACCLAMATION WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE BECAUSE THERE'S ONE NAME ON THE BALLOT. SO THEY'VE JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS THAT ARE ARE BEING CAUSED BY THIS AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE CITY I LIVE IN BUT IT'S ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT THIS PROBLEM IS OCCURRING AND. THAT I THINK THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A PROBLEM EXISTS. AND THAT'S IS NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE GOOD WORK THE TO SEE OVER THE ARE A DOES IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT ALL CITIES ARE LIKE. MY CITY. WHERE H. SWITCH TO BUY DISTRICT ELECTIONS WOULDN'T BENEFIT A PROTECTED CLASS BUT NOT ALL CITIES ARE LIKE THAT AND I THINK THAT IT'S A REASONABLE THING? TO BE ABLE TO TO HAVE TO REQUIRE A PLAINTIFF WHO BRINGS A CHALLENGE UNDER THE CITY ARE A TO PROVE THAT A SWITCH TO BUY DISTRICT ELECTIONS WOULD ACTUALLY BE BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT I DON'T THINK THAT'S UNREASONABLE AT ALL. SO I I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE. I THIS THIS BODY THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE ARE DOING A DISSERVICE TO GOVERNMENTS INTO CITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BY FAILING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. YOU'RE MUCH VICE ARBOR AND THEN. MISTER CALDERON THANK YOU I SHARE THE CONCERNS ARE THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM A BIG BEAR LAKE HAS. I AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SMALLER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE PUT OVER THE BARREL BY THIS PROCESS. I IT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME AFTER HEARING THE COMMENTS THAT UP PART OF THE. THE OPPOSITION'S MOTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE PIPELINES OF CASH FLOWING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO THE. THEIR TREASURIES TO ATTORNEYS TO LAWYERS AYE WHO HAVE THIS WEEK SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE WITH BEING ABLE TO I ASK FOR THESE ATTORNEYS FEES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS. OUT WHICH FEEL THE OBLIGATION TO PAY OUT BECAUSE IT'S SO RISKY FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. I FOR THE PURPOSES OF SLICING UP SMALL COMMUNITIES THERE ALREADY SMALL TO BEGIN WITH. IN DIVIDING OUR CITIES ARE I THINK THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES AN OUTSTANDING REMEDY FOR THIS SITUATION AND I THINK THAT. WHAT THIS IS DEVOLVED INTO IS ABSOLUTELY DEPLORABLE? THE VERY MUCH MISTER CALDERON. WELL FIRST MISSOURI THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION I ALWAYS THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND I I HAVE NO DOUBT. THAT WHAT YOU'RE OFFERING. IS IS SERVICING THE NEEDS OF YOUR DISTRICT IN YOUR COMMUNITY IN THE CITY OF MISSION VIEJO SUBSEQUENTLY I. I WENT TO IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. IN THE CITY A MISSION VIEJO HA. YEAH BUT I ALSO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE. WITH THIS I REPRESENT A COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY SEPT SEVENTY PERCENT LATINO AT MY DISTRICT. ARE AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CITY OF LA MIRADA PRICKLY IN A PREDOMINATELY LATINO NOW WHEN THE TINO SITS ON THE CITY COUNCIL THEY JUST MOVED DISTRICT ELECTIONS. IN THE CITY OF ANAHEIM DID THIS WAS NOT IN MY DISTRICT THE CITY OF ANAHEIM DID THIS HAD NO LATINO ON THE. ARE ON THE THE. THE CITY COUNCIL OTHER AS A EN. IT AND I THINK THE BIGGEST CASE A AND AND AND AND THE STRONGEST EXAMPLE THAT I HAVE IS MY CITY THE CITY THAT I LIVE IN IS THE CITY OF WHITTIER. WHICH WE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A CITY WITH. THE TWO CITIES WITHIN ONE AYE BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. ARE. DIFFERENCES VERY BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ARE AT THIS CITY OUT ONE SIDE VERSUS THE OTHER YOU HAVE ONE SIDE IS REALLY NICE REALLY IF ONE WERE ON THE HILLS. WELL LOT OF INVESTMENTS ARE MADE A LOT OF. A LOT OF THE CITY. HAS BEEN TAKING CARE OF WHERE ON THE SIDE CITY WHERE I LIVE ARE IT'S BEEN A VERY MUCH IGNORED AND THERE'S A LACK OF RESOURCES AND LACK OF. OUR INVESTMENT ON THAT SIDE OF WHITTIER AND AND I THINK. A THE ISSUE IS IS THAT. ALL OF THE. COUNCIL MEMBERS OF THE TIME WERE LIVING OBVIOUSLY IN THE VERY NICE PART. OF WHAT YOU'RE NOT LIVING ON THE PART. WHERE I LIVE? I AND AND SO WOULD HERE THE CITY OF WHAT YOU'RE VOLUNTARILY WENT TO DISTRICT ELECTIONS WITH AN AT LARGE MAYOR. AND AND NOW THERE ARE. THREE LATINOS THAT OUR ON THE CITY COUNCIL THE DISTRICT IN WHICH I LIVE NOW THERE IS A LOT INVESTMENT THEY'RE MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN IMPROVEMENTS ARE DOING HOUSING PROJECT. ARE WITHIN THAT SIDE IN THAT PART. OF OF MY TOWN A OUT OF MY SIGHT OF WHITTIER. AND AND JUST IN TERMS OF TURNOUT BECAUSE WE LOOK WE LOOKED AT. I THINK LOCAL ELECTION JUST IN GENERAL THERE'S ALWAYS VERY LOW TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY OF WATER BECAUSE IT'S AN OFF. CYCLE ELECTION IT'S AN APRIL IT'S NOT A JUNE OR NOVEMBER AND SO THE TURNOUT IS USUALLY VERY LEVEL WE BROKEN UP BY THE DISTRICTS WHAT THEY AT FIGURE OUT THE DISTRICTS. AND THE TURN ON THE DISTRICT WHERE I LIVE HAD MORE THAN DOUBLED. WITH WITH THE. WITH THAT ONE WE WANTED DISTRICT ELECTIONS AND ELECTED AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S NOT ONLY LGBT BUT ALL IS ALSO A LATINO THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ADVOCATE. AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH TO REOPEN A COURTHOUSE TO TO GET THESE INVESTMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS HOUSING PROJECTS. AYE AND SO IT REALLY HAS IS DONE A LOT TO HELP OUT. ME PERSONALLY IN TERMS OF WHERE I LIVE IN MY DISTRICT AND SO I'VE SEEN THE IMPACT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE IN THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AND YOU KNOW. I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL WOULD HAVE ON AND I NO DOUBT THINK THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN THE YOU ARE ADVOCATING FOR YOUR COMMUNITY I JUST FEEL LIKE. THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD WOULD WOULD BE HARMFUL TO MIKE. AT THIS TIME BUT I'D I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THE WORK THAT YOU DON. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON. I AM A COMMENTS THAT ARE GONNA LET. ASK YOU TO CLOSE THE AS OPPOSED ALLEN ONLY DO IT. BUT THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT HAS HAD A TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT ON THE WAY THE LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE ELECTING CALIFORNIA AND WHILE I AYE DIFFERENT KNOW. THAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY CITY IN HIS DISTRICT. I DO FEAR THAT THIS BILL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CHALLENGE AT LARGE ELECTION. THAT UNDERMINE VOTING RIGHTS. BUT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME I'D I'D. DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS IS PERFECT I ALSO DON'T THINK THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS PERFECT A AND I DO THINK THAT THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS BEING ABUSED. A BY LAWYERS. WHO WHO HAVEN'T NECESSARILY DONE THE PROPER RESEARCH INTO CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS AND WHETHER OR NOT MOVING TO ADD DISTRICT ELECTIONS IS THE IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION? FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S HELPFUL OR ACCURATE TO IMPUGN THE MOTIVES OF THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS HERE TODAY. BY IT BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THOSE STAKEHOLDERS ASIDE TO IDENTIFY. IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. I I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION TODAY. BY I'D I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THAT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS A AND LIKE TO GET. THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IMPORT ON. BECAUSE. NOW WE CAN'T JUST KEEP ON OPPOSING EVERY EVERY SOLUTION AND NOT INTRODUCE SOME SOLUTIONS OF OUR OWN SO ALEC FOR TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN IN. BOAT. WILL RECOMMEND IN THE POST POSITION ON ON YOUR BILL TODAY. AND I WITHOUT GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE WELL EARNED FIRST MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO PUBLICLY THANK YOU. THIS BILL CAME UP TO SHORTS WEEKS AGO BUT WITH THE SITUATION IN MISSION VIEJO YOU PROVIDED ME WITH THE COURTESY. OF GETTING IT ON THIS AGENDA ABOUT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT ADDITIONALLY THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. INITIALLY PROVIDED SOME ABOUT SOME OBSTACLES WE REMOVE THE FISCAL LABELED THAT GOT US PASSING GUIDELINES I JUST WANNA THANK YOU PUBLICLY YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR. FOR HELPING THE UP. IF THIS BILL ON THE AGENDA AND HOPEFULLY WE STARTED A CONVERSATION HERE. AS WAS SAID BY. COREY WITH TOWNS A PUBLIC AFFAIRS THE MISSION VIEJO EXAMPLE DID FIND SOME IRREGULARITIES BUT WAS SPREAD OUT THROUGH THE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES GOING TO DISTRICTS WOULDN'T SOLVE THAT ELECTION. AND SO AS WE WORK THIS LEGISLATION. WE FOUND IN THE LAW THAT THERE'S THESE ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES THAT AREN'T REALLY DEFINE SO REALLY MY INTENT HERE IS TO GET US OUT OF THE LITIGATION. BOTH SIDES. THE OPPONENT SAID IT WAS VERY COSTLY BURDEN ON PLAINTIFFS AND THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT ATTORNEYS FEES AND GOVERNMENT RATES. WELL IT'S VERY BURDENSOME ON THE TAXPAYER TO TO GO THROUGH THESE COSTLY ABOUT A LITIGATIONS. IF THE PARTIES CAN COME TOGETHER AND GOING TO MEDIATION SETTING AND COME UP WITH THESE ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES THAT WOULD SATISFY PROBLEM SO WHAT MY AND HOPEFULLY A START OF A CONVERSATION. THAT WE CAN GET OUT OF THIS STALEMATE LITIGATION AND FOR EXAMPLE LIKE MISSION VIEJO IF DISTRICT ELECTIONS WORK THE ANSWER. MAYBE THE PARTIES CAN GET TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT THESE ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES WHICH ARE DIVINE LAW BUT COULD BE SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS BILL. AND. YOU KNOW I RESPECT CLASH DRIVE VOTE BUT HOPEFULLY WE STARTED A CONVERSATION I KNOW IT'S LATE IN THE SESSION BUT MAYBE WE CAN TAKE THIS UP NEXT YEAR JUST. AND FIX SOME OF THE ISSUES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY BERMAN NO.

SO CALLED ACCIDENTALLY STATED THAT THAT HE WAS DUMB MAYO OFF AS CITY. UP WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. A HE WAS SO RUNNING FOR ON HIS STUCK CANDIDATES STATEMENT. THIS STATEMENT THE WASHED OUT INCORRECT NOW FOR THE CANDIDATE. OUT WAS THE MAYOR PRO TEM NOT FAMILIAR. NO ATTENDED IT THE STATE THE THAT THAT IT WAS SUB TYPE A TIGHT BALL AND THE PLAYING. OF STATE ELECTION LAW FOR NOT ALLOWING HIM TO CORRECT THE ERROR. EVEN BEFORE THE FILING DEADLINE. CURRENT LAW. ALLOWS. OF FOR STATEMENT TO BE WITHDRAWN. BUT DOES NOT CHANGE. DURING VIA PEORIA DUFFEL FIGHTING NOMINATION PAPERS AND UNTIL LATER FIVE P. M. OFTEN NEXT WORKING DAY AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE NOMINATION PERIOD. SO DE JA CONVENTIONAL LA OUT RESPONSE TO RESUME.

CASES OF ACCIDENTAL OR MISSION ONE MISTAKE I WOULD BE OUT TO ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION. HOW ON ARE MOSTLY ACCURATE THAT STATEMENT CANDIDATE THE STATEMENTS WHEN AN ARROW WAS OF FOUND THAT BEFORE THE ARE? DEADLINE. I'M WILLING TO. LIMIT. JUSTIN ONE TIME ARE CORRECTION TO PREVENT DATA MAY BE ABUSED. US SOMEONE RAISE THAT QUESTION. OUR AND THEN ALSO ATON. AS YOU KNOW THE DEADLINE HAS PASSED ABOUT THE WE CAN MAKE GOD THIS ONE TO BE EFFECTIVE OUT FROM. THE E.. JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN NOT TO AFFECT THIS YEAR'S SELECTION. ABOUT WHY THE CANDIDATES ARE CANNOT CHALLENGES ELECTION VICTORY. THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS SO. FIGHTING OF FILING A LAWSUIT IS SAW AN EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR AS YOU KNOW OF FOLK CANDIDATES ENDORSE IT TAKES TIME. FOR THIS REASON A. B. TWENTY FIFTY ONE OFFER SUCH A MORE RECENT EMPLOYER REMEDY. COLLEAGUES BY ENACTING AB. TWENTY FIFTY ONE WE PROVIDE A COMMON SENSE OF SOLUTION. SO ISSUES SO FUN NECESSARILY ARISING FROM AROUND THE CANDIDATES STATEMENTS. I RESPECT MEDIA ESCORIAL I'VE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OR CONCERN. GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN RIGHT RUN GO WITH THE PLASTIC COUNTY THAT COURT REPORTER ELECTIONS OFFICE AND CA CEO. WE ARE NOT. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WHERE I WORKING WITH DOCTOR CHOICE OFFICE WE'RE VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO. WORK ON THIS HE'S MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS THAT. ADDRESSING OUR CONCERNS BUT IN YOUR ANALYSIS YOU'LL SEE THAT WE STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL AND WE JUST WANTED OF KNOWLEDGE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL BONUSES IN OPPOSITION SAYING NINE BRING ABOUT BECAUSE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER OBERNOLTE AND MISTER THEM MUCH SHARPER. A THINK MISTER CHAIR TO THANK YOU FOR BIG BRING THE BILL FORWARD UP HAPPY TO SPORTED TODAY I DO HAVE ONE CONCERN THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO LOOK AT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. A AND THAT IS THAT WE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT TO ENABLE POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP. WITH THIS CHANGE TO THE TO ELECTION LAW SO. FOR EXAMPLE IF TWO CANDIDATES WERE TRYING TO ONE UP EACH OTHER EACH SUCCESSIVELY AMENDING THEIR BOOK. THEIR STATEMENTS THAT WOULD NOT BE YOU KNOW GOOD THINGS CORRECTING ERRONEOUS INFORMATION IS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD PERMIT SO. OKAY TO. REMEDY THAT CONCERN PLENTY A. THE END OF OF FILING PERIOD. NO ONE CAN SEE. EACH OTHER SO STATEMENT. SO YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE. BASED UPON YOUR OPPONENTS STATEMENT. SO IT'LL BE YOURSELF CORRECTION. A. SOMEHOW. THAT CANDIDATES SAID THE MAYOR. TO. YEAH GIVE HIM A BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THE AND MAYOR PRO TEM MAYOR AS SIZE AND NOT A TYPO BUT THE. IF FOR. HE OR SHE HAS CORRECTED THAT DURING THAT PERIOD THE WHY WOULD JULIUS ARE NOW BUT THEY'RE NOT THE CORRECTION. THAT IS A VERY LOGICAL TO ME. CHUCK WELL YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MY SUPPORT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WEREN'T ENABLING THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU. BUT HOWEVER. THANK YOU JUST UP ALONG A SIMILAR LINE I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT THAT YOU TOOK BECAUSE I THINK IT PREVENTS SAID THAT SITUATION BECAUSE WHAT I. I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE. WAYS FOR THEY STATEMENTS TO BE REVEALED PEOPLE MODIFY THEM IT WOULD BE MORE OF A REPORT ALL. I'D BEEN A STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS WHICH IS WHAT THE. ACTUALLY ARE IN SO WELL WITH THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS AYE AND DIE I WOULD ENCOURAGE TO KEEP. WORKING WITH THE RED SHARP VOTERS BY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS AYE CAPTAIN WITH WITH THEIR WORK FLOW. AYE BECAUSE THAT IS YOU AND I KNOW AT THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTRAR VOTERS OUT WITH SO MANY JURISDICTIONS. UNDER THE. THE COUNTY AYE IT'S CERTAINLY A CROWDED ATMOSPHERE THOSE THE LAST A COUPLE OF DECADES AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE APPROACHING AYE TOWARDS THE A VERY AND. BUT WITH THAT DEBT I'LL MAKE THE A MOTION NOW FOR YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ANY ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. BUT MANY ASKED WE ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND WHILE I APPRECIATE. A THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS GAME PLAYING ISSUES PREVIOUSLY REYES. I I STILL BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY. THAT THE BALLOT STATEMENT THAT WE MAKE IS. THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED TWO HUNDRED WORDS THAT I EVER WROTE. IN MY LIFE. AND. YOU KNOW WHAT A CANDIDATE SHOULD DO IS IS WAIT TILL THE END WAIT TILL THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH IT MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE. DONE ALL THE EDITS NECESSARY BEFORE SUBMITTING IT BUT EVEN IN THIS INSTANCE AT YOU AS YOU SAID WE WE DON'T ALLOW OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE IT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO ALLOW GAMESMANSHIP. NON THAT MEANS THAT IF SOMEBODY. BY ACCIDENTALLY CALLS THEMSELVES THE MAYOR. AMATEUR HOW SOMEBODY BY ACCIDENTALLY DOES THAT. THAT STILL WON'T BE REVEALED UNTIL AFTER THE FILING DEADLINE AND AND SO AND THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN REMEDIES THAT CAN BE MADE TO ADDRESS THAT AND AND I FEAR THAT THIS WOULD CREATE A LOT OF WORK. FOR OUR REGISTRARS ESPECIALLY AT AT THE TIME WHEN THEY'RE THE MOST BUSY BECAUSE OF US DIG CANDIDATES AND AND BY HUMAN NATURE WE. ARE DEADLINE DRIVEN AND NOBODY FALLS THEIR PAPERWORK UNTIL THE VERY END ANYHOW AND SO. BECAUSE OF THOSE CONCERNS IT THAT ARE OUT AND AND OTHERS THAT ARE ONE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I'M UNABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN. BERMAN NO HARPER. HARPER AYE CALDERON. LOW. MULLIN. OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE AYE WEBER. WEBER NOW. SO THAT BILL IS ON CALL THE TO TO VOTE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE ARE DID NOT BELONG CALL. AND NEXT UP. IS. NOW ABOUT. DOCTOR WEBER. LET'S DO IT AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY TWO. ITEM NUMBER FOUR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY HAVE THE PLEASURE PRESENTING AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY TWO WHICH MAKES TECHNICAL CHANGES TO FACILITATE THE NEW METHOD OF COUNTING STATE PRISONERS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. SINCE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES THAT OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IT TAKES. A NEW DISTRICT LINES FOR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS ARE BASED ON CENSUS COUNTS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE A CENSUS WHERE EVERYONE IS COUNT IT APPROPRIATELY. THAT INCLUDES A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND INCARCERATED PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. PRIOR TO TWENTY ELEVEN STATE PRISONERS WERE COUNTED AS RESIDING AT THE STATE FACILITY WHERE THEY WERE HELD INFLATING THE POPULATION OF COUNTIES WHERE THEY MIGHT WHERE THERE MIGHT BE FEWER PEOPLE OTHERWISE. IN TWENTY ELEVEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED AB TWO FOUR TWENTY WHICH REQUIRED ALL STATE INMATES TO BE COUNTED AT THEIR LAST KNOWN PLACE OF RESIDENCE INSTEAD OF AT THE CD. SEE OUR FACILITY STATED STARTING WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. THAT ALONE SHOULD THE PRISONERS WILL BE COUNTED AS AS PART OF THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES WHICH BETTER REPRESENT THEM. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE TECHNICAL CHANGESIT TO FACILITATE THE TWENTY TWENTY HAS CENSUS DATA TRANSFER FROM CDC ARE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. THAT DATA INCLUDES AN ANONYMOUS IDENTIFIER RACE ETHNICITY AND LAST KNOWN PLACE OF RESIDENCE WHICH WILL HELP THE COMMISSION DRAW THE NEW LINES INTO A FOOT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS AND HAS NO OPPOSITION WITH ME TODAY IS KAREN MCDONALD THE DIRECTOR OF THE STATEWIDE DATABASE AND ELECTION ADMINISTRATION. ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH CENTER AT UC BERKELEY. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR BERMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHEN MS CURRENT MCDONALD'S I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE STATEWIDE DATABASE ON A JOB THAT I FELT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. THE STATE WERE DATABASES THE REDISTRICTING DATABASE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO SERVE AS A LIAISON TO THE CENSUS REDISTRICTING AND VOTING RIGHTS STATE OFFICE. STATEWIDE DATABASE JUST TO GIVE YOU A QUICK OVERVIEW IS OUR LONGITUDINAL DATA BASE AT BILL STATE ASSETS OVER TIME SO THAT POPULATION PARTICIPATION AND VOTING TRENDS CAN BE ASSESSED. WE COLLECT DATA FROM EACH COUNTY REGISTRAR OF VOTERS FOR EACH STATEWIDE ELECTION WE PROCESS THE DATA AND THEN WE PROVIDED THROUGH. A WEEK PROVIDED PUBLICLY THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. AT THE END OF EACH DECADE WE MARCH ALL OF OUR PREVIOUS COLLECTED DATA SETS TO THE NEW CENSUS DATA. AND TO THIS TO THE NEW CENSUS GEOGRAPHY TO BUILD A REDISTRICTING DATA SET FOR USE ELSE. WHO IS INTERESTED IN USING THE STATE ARE? YES THEY WERE DATABASES A TRANSPARENT PUBLIC AND NONPARTISAN PROJECT ARE LOCATED ON THE UC BERKELEY CAMPUS. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT FOR NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING THAT IT STREAMLINED STATE OUR TRANSFERS SO ABOUT WORK ON INTEGRATING THE DATA INTO THE REDISTRICTING. DATA SAID CAN ARE BEGIN IN A TIMELY FASHION AND THAT WILL ALLOW FOR POTENTIAL PROBLEMS TO BE WORKED OUT IN ADVANCE AND THEN DOCUMENTATION TO BE CREATED FOR THE NEW DATA SET. SO THAT THE NEW CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WHICH OF COURSE WILL BE INCOMING AT THAT PARTICULAR ERA POINT IN TIME WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO USE THE AGES THE ADJUSTED DATA. SECOND IT CLARIFIES THE DATE ON WHICH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF OUR CORRECTIONS AND WE URBAN. REHABILITATION ARM HAVE TO GIVE US THE DATA SO ARM. THE DATA HAVE TO BE CURRENT ON THE SAME DATE ON WHICH THE CENSUS COLLECTS A TWENTY TWENTY DOESN'T SUIT AT DECENNIAL CENSUS WHICH IS ON APRIL ONE TWENTY TWO AND. TWENTY WHICH OF COURSE ISN'T STATE. IT ALSO ALLOWS THE CDC ARE TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INMATE POPULATIONS RACE AND ETHNICITY. SO THAT THE SENSE DATA CAN BE ADJUSTED ON BOTH ENDS ON THE END WHERE THE FACILITY IS AND THEN ALSO WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ALLOCATED. ARE IN THE SENSE BLOCK WHERE THE FACILITIES LOCATED AND THEN ON THE CENSUS BLOCK ON THE OTHER END. THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS THAT WOULD ARISE IF THIS BILL DID NOT PASS ARM ONE IT WOULD CREATE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN MAKING THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT AB FOR TWENTY THE POLICY THAT. PASSED IN TWENTY TEN HAD ENVISIONED A ONE WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ADJUST THE RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA WITHOUT CD SEE ARE GIVING IT TO US CLEARLY. AND ARE ALSO THE DATA STATE THE DATA SAID RECEIVED FROM CDC ARE MAY NOT BE FROM THE SAME DATE AS A CENSUS DATA BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CONSTANTLY FLUCTUATING POPULATION THIS WOULD CREATE DATA PROBLEMS. AND FINALLY THE STREAMLINED AT DATA TRANSFER WILL GIVE US SOME CERTAINTY FOUR WHEN THE DATA WILL ARRIVE SO THAT WE CAN PREPARE FOR IT. SO TO SUMMARIZE THIS IS REALLY A BILL ABOUT TECHNICAL DETAILS REGARDING THE DATA AND THE DAN DATA TRANSFER. AND ARE IT WILL REALLY MAKE THIS BILL ARM BETTER IMPLEMENTABLE AND MORE EFFICIENT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY THIS NOTICES IN SUPPORT. THOSE MODOC MINE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT THINK THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE I BRING ABOUT HER COLLEAGUES FROM QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BUT ROBERT. VERY MUCH MISSED. THIS BILL HELPS I IMPLEMENT AB FOR TWENTY. WHICH ASKS THE CITIZENS REDISTRICT MISSION TO ACCOUNT PRISONERS OUT WHERE THEY USED TO LIVE UP BUT NOT WHERE THEY LIVE NOW. USING PUBLIC RESOURCES IT WOULD ALSO APPLY TO PRISONERS ON DEATH ROW A IS WELL AS THOSE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES BUT WHY WOULD WE WANT TO COUNT PRISONERS ON DEATH ROW AND THOSE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES. I. INSTEAD COUNTING THEM PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO RETURN TO. WELL THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THEY MAY NEVER RETURNED BUT SOMETIMES THEY DO RETURN NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. OTHER STILL HAVE TO BE REPRESENTED I MEAN PEOPLE WHO INCARCERATED OFTENTIMES STILL PAY TAXES. AND. AND AND AND OWN A PROPERTY AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE AND THEY NEED TO BE COUNTED SO IT'S A MATTER OF THE CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY GIVING IT ACRID COUNT. OF THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT MAYBE A FEW PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT EVERY CALIFORNIANS CENSUS COUNTS EVERYONE WHETHER THEY'RE CITIZEN IN OUT. THE PURPOSE IS TO COUNT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. I AM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLACE IS THEY COME FROM WHAT THE PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTITY AS THEY HAVE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF REPRESENTATION FOR THEM. BEAR MANY WHO OUR WORK MAY BE ON LIFE SENTENCING WHO ACTUALLY GET OUT I MEAN WE DON'T KNOW. A AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT WE DO AND WE KNOW THE PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW STAY THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. IT IS NOT JUST A QUICK THING THAT THEY GO IN AND OUT. OF IT BUT IT THE CENSUS COUNTS EVERY PERSON WHO IS IN CALIFORNIA AND EVERY STATE. I AGREE WITH YOU ON MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE'S COUNTED BUT IT USE A VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE TO ASK THE QUESTION MANSON FAMILY MEMBER PATRICIA KRENWINKEL. IS SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE FOR MURDER. AND HAS BEEN LIVING AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN IN CHINO IN SAM BERTINO COUNTY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. PRIOR TO HER ARREST IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SHE LIVED IN CHATSWORTH. IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AT THE SPAHN RANCH. WHY SHOULD SHE BE COUNTED? AS LIVING IN LOS ANGELES RATHER THAN CHINO. THE QUESTION OF PEOPLE BEING REPRESENTED IF THEY'RE LIVING IN CORCORAN IF THEY'RE LIVING IN SAN QUENTIN THAT THEY'RE LIVING IN FOLSOM. OR IF YOU'RE LIVING IN CHINO SHOULDN'T THEY BE COUNTED WHERE THEY LIVE. THIS IS ANOTHER BILL THAT WE DID NOT THAT IS NOT THIS BILL BASICALLY THIS IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED WHAT IN TWENTY TEN. PUT ELEVEN. THAT WAS PASSED AT THAT TIME AND SO WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THAT BILL. WERE NOT BASICALLY. ARGUING WHETHER WHERE THEY SHOULD BE COUNTED THAT WAS ALREADY DECIDED IN THAT PARTICULAR BILL THIS HELPS TO IMPLEMENT IT. WHAT SPECIFIC TO THIS BILL BUT IT DOES REQUIRE THE CDC ARE TO REPORT INMATE CENSUS DATA TO THE LEGISLATURE? BUT THE LEGISLATURE IS YOU KNOW IS NO LONGER INVOLVED IN DRAWING POLITICAL DISTRICT BOUNDARIES SO WHY SHOULD THIS LEGISLATION REQUIRE THAT INFORMATION BE GIVEN TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE HER ANSWER FOURTH. YEAH THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTUALLY STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THEIR REDISTRICTING DATA SET. SO THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE DATA TO BE MORE STREAMLINED GIVEN TO US SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT. VISIT ON THANK YOU FOR CLARIFICATION THANK YOU MUCH TROUBLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I NEED A SO THAT ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES. I. I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. WE JUST CLOSED OUT WEBER OUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE THIS IS A TECHNICAL BILL BUILDING ON A OF A BILL THAT'S TEN YEARS OLD IN TERMS OF JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEPT ACCURATELY IMPLEMENT.

ONE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO ENSURE THAT PREVIOUSLY ENACTED LEGISLATION. CAN BE CARRIED OUT AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED. AS WE APPROACH THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE REDISTRICTING PROCESS. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ENSURE THAT THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION HAS THE INFORMATION IT NEEDS TO COUNT PRISONERS AT THEIR LAST KNOWN PLACE OF RESIDENCE FOR REDISTRICTING PURPOSES IF THE COMMISSION DECIDES TO DO SO. SO I RECOMMEND SUPPORT OF THIS BILL MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BERMAN AYE BERMAN AYE HARPER. HARPER NO CALDERON. LOW LEVEL AYE MULLIN.

IN OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO ADDRESS FEEDBACK FROM THE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND I APPRECIATE THOSE EFFORTS AND WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONTINUE.

MOVING DOWN THE ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN ARE MISTER HARPER ANY OF YOUR THREE BILLS IN ANY ORDER THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT NO GO AHEAD PRESENTED FOLLOWER GREAT THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE THIS BILL WOULD RESTORE THE CITIZENS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A SPEEDY RECALL AND REMOVE TO REMOVE ELECTED OFFICIALS. ACCUSE THE MISCONDUCT AND REPLACE THEM WITH A SUCCESSOR FOR THE TERM OF THEIR OFFICE THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SPECIFICALLY PROVIDES THAT ONCE THE REQUISITE NUMBER SIGNATURES ON A RECALL PETITION HAS BEEN PRESENTED CERTIFIED. THE RECALL ELECTION MUST BE HELD WITHIN SIXTY TO EIGHTY DAYS YET RECENTLY SOME CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS FILED TO RECALL SENATOR WHO REPRESENT HIM AND THE RULES WERE CHANGED WHILE THE PROCESS WAS UNDERWAY. CITIZEN ACTION WAS THE BIRDS TOOK THE MAJORITY PARTY COULD SAVE ONE OF THEIR OWN. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SENATE BILL ONE SEVENTEEN. THIS LAW NEW LAW ADDED COSTLY AND LENGTHY DELAYS TO THE RECALL PROCESS AND OBSTRUCTED THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. PREVIOUSLY EXISTING LAW GAVE VOTERS WHO SIGNED THE RECALL PETITIONS UP TO THIRTY DAYS TO WITHDRAW THEIR SIGNATURES. IF THERE WERE ENOUGH SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY THE RECALL THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES. WOULD HAVE TO ISSUE THE COST OF THE ESTIMATE RECALL ELECTION. AFTER THAT PART WAS COMPLETE THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WOULD HELP THERE ARE THIRTY DAYS FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT ON THE ESTIMATED COST OF ELECTION. SINCE NINETEEN THIRTEEN THERE'VE BEEN ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR RECALL ATTEMPTS LAUNCHED AGAINST STATE OFFICIALS BUT THE RECALL OF STATE SENATOR JOSH NEWMAN IS THE FIRST TO BE RECONSIDERED. UNDER THESE RULES THAT WERE CHANGED MID PROCESS ALTHOUGH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SIGNATURES WERE TURNED INTO TRIGGER THE RECALL ELECTION DUE TO SENATE BILL ONE SEVENTEEN. AND ITS MID PROCESS CHANGES CENTER NEWMAN'S CONSTITUENTS ABILITY BE ABLE VOTE ON HIS RECALL WOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL JUNE TWENTY ODD JUNE FIFTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN. STATEWIDE PRIMARY ELECTION WITHOUT THESE OBSTRUCTIVE CHANGES THE RECALL ELECTION WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD IN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN A SPEEDY PROCESS AS ASK FOR BY OUR CONSTITUTION. ADDITIONALLY THE NEW RULES DID NOT CHANGE THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS TO RECALL THEIR SENATOR. ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX OUT OF SEVENTY THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT VOTERS WHO SIGNED THE PETITION RECALL SENATOR NEWMAN WITHDREW THEIR SIGNATURES. SPIKE A WELL FUNDED CAMPAIGN. TO RECRUIT WITHDRAWALS. THIS WAS JUST ONE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL SIGNATURES A ON THE RECALL PETITION AND IT DID NOT AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF SIGNATURESNEEDED TO INITIATE THE RECALL ELECTION. THIS BILL WOULD RESTORE THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS A RIGHT TO A SPEEDY RECALL OF ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCUSED OF WRONGDOING. OR GET AND GIVEN THE JUSTICE THAT THEY SEEK WITH ME HERE TODAY IS IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE IS DAVID. DEEP WALL FROM THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. WE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MISTER HARPER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORNING DAVID WILL FOOT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BELL AND. MISTER HARPER I THINK APTLY STATED WITH THE BILL DID SOME MY REMARKS AGAIN BE PRETTY HAVE BREAST CAN SIMPLE. LISTEN TO CHANGE THE RULES OF THE GAME AT HALFTIME REGARDING AN ACTIVE RECALL IS INAPPROPRIATE AND IT DOES NEGATIVELY INFRINGE UPON THE DEMOCRATS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. MEMBERS THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO NEED HE PUT THE HINDRANCES IN THE RECALL PROCESS THAT S. B. ONE SEVENTEEN DEAD THERE'S NO REASON TO WAIT THIRTY DAYS. TO PAUL SIGNATURES OFF BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY A PROCESS TO PULL SIGNATURES OFF. IF PEOPLE DECIDE THEY NO LONGER WANT TO SUPPORT A RECALL PETITION. YOU KNOW THERE WAS NOT NO REASON FOR ANY OF THE DELAYS PUT IN PLACE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LAND THE RECALL BEYOND OCTOBER FROM WASHED YEAR. TO NOW JUNE OF THIS YEAR AND. FOR THOSE REASONS ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE AT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRINGING IT BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOU WANNA GRAB AB. MOST HAVING TO GIVE A COURTESY SECOND. SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. MISS ARE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE COURTESY YEAH. IN THIS CASE THIS THIS BILL WOULD NOT AFFECT THE CURRENT RECALL OF VERSES AT CENTER JOSH KNEW THAT RECALL WILL TAKE PLACE ON JUNE FIFTH. AYE AND UNLIKE A SENATE BILL ONE SEVENTEEN THE CHANGES TO THE RECALL PROCESS UNDER THIS BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE WILL AFFECT FUTURE RECALLS NOT THE CURRENT ONE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THOSE WHO SPOKE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE THE RECENT CHANGES TO THE RECALL PROCESS I BELIEVE WERE WRONG AND UNJUST AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TO RESTORE. THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY RECALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MISTER HARPER. IN THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE TO THE RECALL PROCESS IS PART OF THE BUDGET LAST YEAR WERE RESPONSE TO SERIOUS ABUSES TO THAT PROCESS. SO I'M NOT PREPARED AT THIS POINT TO VOTE FOR EFFORTS TO UNDO THOSE CHANGES AND AS A RESULT I'M UNABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN. BERMAN NO HARPER AYE HARPER AYE CALDERON. LOW. LOW NO MULLIN. OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE AYE WEBER. WEBER KNOW THAT BILL IS ON CALL. AND MISTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE ON TO. EITHER IN EXTRA BILLS YES I'LL DO WHAT AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY TO THE NEXT ONE ON PILE ORDER GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M HERE PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY TWO. THIS BILL REPEAL LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS TO AVOID DISCLOSED YOUR MARK CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT THEY SOLICIT FROM THEIR MEMBERS. INSTEAD SUCH ORGANIZATIONS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR THRESHOLD FOR DISCLOSURE THAT APPLIES TO EVERY SINGLE OTHER ORGANIZATION. CANDIDATE AND COMMITTEE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR PROHIBITS PERSONS FROM COLLECTING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE PURPOSES PARTICULAR CANDIDATE. UNLESS THE IDENTITIES OF THE CONTRIBUTORS ARE DISCLOSED IN THAT DOCUMENT. ACCORDINGLY PERSONS OR ORGANIZATIONS THAT SELECTION SOLICIT SUCH EARMARKED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OTHERS MUST DISCLOSE THE IDENTITIES OF CONTRIBUTORS TO GIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE. FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION HAS NOTED THAT THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT BANDS EARMARKED CONTRIBUTIONS WITHOUT DISCLOSURE OF THE TRUE SOURCE OF THE FUNDS. BECAUSE THEY COULD DEPRIVE THE PUBLIC OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION OF WHO IS DONATING TO CAMPAIGNS AND BECAUSE THEY FACILITATE THE UNLAWFUL CIRCUMVENTION OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE CALIFORNIA DISCLOSURE. TO INCREASE THE DISCLOSURE OF THE IDENTITIES OF GROUPS THAT PAPER POLITICAL ADS IRONICALLY THE ACT ALSO DECREASED THE DISCLOSURE OF PERSONS WHO MAY LAW UNDER CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS. BY RAISING THE DISCLOSURE CULTURAL FOR SUCH PERSONS FROM ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY IT STATED THAT EARMARKED EMBARK PAYMENTS OF UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ARE GIVEN BY PERSONS TO THEIR UNION. OR MY OTHER MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION FOR THE PURPOSE A BEING TRANSMITTED TO A CANDIDATE OR BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEE SHALL NOT BE EARMARKED AND THEREFORE SHALL NOT BE DISCLOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION. A. F. PPC REPORT NOTED THAT THE CALIFORNIA DISCLOSE ACT CREATED EIGHT WHOM TRACK DISCLOSURE SYSTEM FOR EARMARKED CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MEMBER OR MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING UNIONS ORGANIZED LABOR. ONLY HAVE TO DISCLOSE DONORS AT BUT THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR THRESHOLD. WELL OTHER ALL OTHER POLITICAL COMMITTEES HAVE TO DISCLOSURE CONTRIBUTORS AT THE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR LEVEL. SUCH LOOPHOLES ALLOW PERSONS TO EVADE CONTRIBUTION LIMITS BY GIVING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT DIRECTLY TO A CANDIDATE AND THEN POTENTIALLY LAUNDERING AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION OF UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE SAME CANDIDATE. THROUGH THE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION WITHOUT THEIR IDENTITIES EVEN BEING DISCLOSED. AS NOTED BY THE F. PPC ANALYSIS OF A SIMILAR BILL NO RATIONAL EXPLANATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO CREATE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLE TO CONTRIBUTION LIMITS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY TWO WILL DECREASE DARK MONEY. IN CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS AND MAKE IT HARDER TO LAUNDER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS BY REPEALING CLOSE THE IDENTITIES OF PERSONS WHO MAKE EARMARKED. POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WITH ME HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE. OR I'M SORRY TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY TWO IS DAVID WALL FROM THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS YES SOME BACKDATED WOLF WITH BARRY JARVIS TAXPAYERS SAY SHE NEVER LEFT I'D STROKE. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL HERE TODAY AS WELL. AND MEMBERS WE WERE BROADLY EVEN THOUGH WE OPPOSED AB TWO FORTY NINE LAST YEAR MR MULLIN BUT WE WERE BROADLY IN SUPPORT OF I THINK MANY MANY PIECES IN THIS BILL AND. YOU KNOW MISTER HARPER REFERENCES ONE PIECE THAT WE WERE OPPOSED TO FOR THE SIMPLE REASON OF IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE DISCLOSURE. LET'S HAVE DISCLOSURE. YOU KNOW WHY IT IS AVERAGE WIDER AVERAGE EVERYDAY PEOPLE HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATIONS AS MISTER HARPER MENTION WHICH INCLUDES. YOU KNOW LABOR PUBLIC COMPLAIN LABOR UNIONS HAVE TO DISCLOSE ITS FUN AT FIVE HUNDRED WHY NOT HAVE THE SAME STANDARD ACROSS THE BOARD THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO A DECREASE IN DARK MONEY AS MR HARPER SAT. AND MEMBERS THAT IS FAIR DISCLOSURE THAT'S ALL WE WANT HER CELL ASK FOR NUMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING A FEW GO AHEAD. BUT THE TRAVELING PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN SPONSOR OF A AB TWO FORTY NINE. WE WE CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO AN INCREASE IN THE MONEY LAUNDERING. OPPORTUNITIES OR OR LESSEN DISCLOSURE THAT IS THE ACT ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE A. PURPOSE OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ACT LAST YEAR I'M WE DO BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THIS THIS PARTICULAR. CHANGE WOULD BE ILL ADVISED FOR DOING SO FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. I'M A FIRST OF ALL. IT IS IT IS NOT A ALLOWING. LAUNDERING OF CONTRIBUTIONS IT ONLY APPLIES TO MEMBER DUES FEES AND ASSESSMENTS AS THE ASSEMBLY ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THOSE ARE SIMPLY MANDATORY CONTRIBUTIONS. A A A MEMBERS OF IT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS CAN OPT OUT BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY DO ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. OF MORE IMPORTANTLY IS IS THE A. I AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL EXTRA BURDENS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. A. DOING RAISING THAT THRESHOLD WOULD ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF THE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION ITSELF. BEETLE LABOR UNION OR ANY OTHER MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION. THEM THEMSELVES NOT BEING DISCLOSED ON ADS AS THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE DISCLOSE ACT BECAUSE THE CONTRIBUTIONS WOULDN'T BE. A EARMARKED FROM THEM THEY'D BE HERE MARK FROM THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF CAPE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. ON THAT. A A IT DOES NOT. AND I THINK THERE MAY BE MISREADING IT DOES NOT SAY THAT THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS AREN'T CONSIDERED YOUR MARKETS AS IT IS. SAYS AND I THINK IT'S BEEN INTERPRETED BY A PPC REGULATIONS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THOSE ARE CONSIDERED AS YOUR MARK FROM. THE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION ITSELF SO. THAT IS WHY THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WILL LESSEN THE DISCLOSURE IN CASES LIKE IN THE A A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DONE. IT WOULD CAUSE NOBODY TO BE DISCLOSED BECAUSE NONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS AGAPE TO INNER DOLLARS GOING TO REACH THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD. INTO WOULD MEAN THAT THE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION ITSELF WOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED ON ADS THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR MISTAKE FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW THEREFORE WE ASK YOU OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS TRISTEN BROWN OF CALVET FEDERATION OF TEACHERS JUST WANTED POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS IN OPPOSITION HERE'S THAT ONE. WHAT WE KNOW WHAT THIS A PORTION OF DISCLOSE ACT WAS A CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED AND WELL BALANCED TEST THAT? WAS UNDER MUCH SCRUTINY WHEN THE DISCLOSE ACT WAS PASSED. OF THE REASON FOR IT BEING OF COURSE THAT MEMBERSHIP BASED ORGANIZATIONS CONSISTENTLY ARE ATTEMPTING TO FUND RAISE FOR THEIR POLITICAL ACTION. MEMBERS HE ACTUALLY HAS VOLUNTARILY DO CONTRIBUTE TO THESE ARE POLITICAL ACTION FUNDS THE SPONSORED COMMITTEES AND THEY DO SO PREMIERED OF REASONS BUT MOSTLY TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF WHATEVER MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION THEY ALL BELONG TO SO YES IN THE IN THE LEAD. INSTANCE OF A STATE TEACHERS UNION AYE IT WOULD BE FOR THE PROTECTION OF PROP NINETY EIGHT AND ANOTHER LABOR STANDARDS IT SAID ABOUT THAT ARE. A BELIEF SHARED BY ALL THE MEMBERS OF THAT ORGANIZATION AS THE CHIP IN MONTHLY SAY A MODEST AMOUNT OF TEN DOLLARS PER MONTH THEY MIGHT RISE UP TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS. I AT WHICH POINT IT IS NICE TO POINT OUT THAT ON THE US SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS FOR SIXTY. ANYONE WHO DOES CONTRIBUTE TO A POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE OVER HUNDRED DOLLARS ARE ITEMIZED AS CONTRIBUTORS AND SO THERE IS A WAY TO FIND THIS INFORMATION IT IS ALREADY DISCLOSED. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE GIVEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ULTIMATELY AFFECTING A AS. THE. I GUESS AND RESULT THE RECIPIENT COMMITTEES CONTRIBUTION AND SO IF OF COMMUNICATION GOES OUT AS THEY PERIODICALLY DUE TO RALLY THE TROOPS AND SAY LET'S ALL COME TOGETHER. PLEASE CHIP IN TO YOUR POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN. ELECT OF THE FAMOUS CANDIDATE ACTS OF WAR CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINST BALLOT MEASURE WISE AND AND. IN ADDICTS AND I GUESS YOU SPUR AN EXAMPLE AS A RALLYING CALL NOT NECESSARILY THAT ALL OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DIRECTLY GOING. TWO CANDIDATE ACTS ABOUT MEASURE WHY I IT IS JUST MUCH EASIER AND I'VE MUCH TRUER TO SAY. THESE BOOKS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THE SPONSORING COMMITTEE NOT GIVING TO THE AS AN INTERMEDIARY AND AS AN EARMARK CONTRIBUTION TO THE. RECIPIENT COMMITTEE. AND SO DOING SO IF WE WERE TO LOWER THE SPECIAL FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ALL OF THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE YOUR MARK PERHAPS IN A WAY THAT IT'S FORCE ASSOCIATION THAT IS NOT INTENDED BY THE ACTUAL CONTRIBUTOR. AYE AND IS. A COSTLY. IT I GUESS SCHEME THAT VAN WOULD BE. SO IT WOULD COST SO MUCH TO THE SPONSORING ORGANIZATION THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER BE EFFECTIVE I ENABLE TO COMPLY WITH WITH THE NEW REGULATION AND THUS RENDER THEIR SPEECH. EARLY I GET CHILL THEIR SPEECH TO A POINT WHERE NOW ONLY THE VERY WELL FUNDED INTEREST COULD ACTUALLY TAKE PART. IN IN THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE SO THAT IS WHY THERE WAS A GREAT BALLOTS STRUCK FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND NOT THE ONE HUNDRED LEVEL AND AGAIN ALL OF THOSE CONTRIBUTORS OVER ONE HUNDRED. DO END UP ON A FOR SIXTY AT THE END OF THE DAY AND EVERYONE CAN AND THERE'S FULL DISCLOSURE OF THAT INFORMATION SO IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE WE ARE AS FOR A. A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL AND KEEP THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE DISCLOSE ACT HOLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MICHELLE CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE TWO PREVIOUS WITNESSES WHERE POST THANK YOU THANK YOU. A SONG OR FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. MUCH TIGHTER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN A POSITION THAT YOU'RE MUCH. PACMAN WITHIN READING ASSOCIATES REPEALING THE ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO COLLEGE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR ROTH OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE CELL. I I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL I'M USUALLY ALWAYS IN FAVOR OF A GREATER DISCLOSURE AND I ACTUALLY FIND IT SOMEWHAT IRONIC THAT THE CROWDS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THIS CHAMBER. COUPLE MINUTES AGO AS WE HEARD ANOTHER BILL. THAT I ADVOCATED FOR GREATER DISCLOSURE NOT HEAR CLAMORING FOR GREATER DISCLOSURE IN THIS CASE BECAUSE. IN I THINK IT'S A IT'S TWO SIDES OF THE SAME POINT. I ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT HOWARD JARVIS IS HERE SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION AND SO. ARE FOR THEM TO BE SAYING PLEASE WE WOULD LIKE GREATER DISCLOSURE LIMITS APPLY TO US I THINK IS REALLY COMPELLING SO I'M A HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AYE DUH. AYE MOVE THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU HAVE A MOTION THAT WE HAVE A SECOND. ARE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER HARPER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE MEASURE. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO I THINK THOSE WHO SPOKE UP BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOW FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF DARK MONEY TO BE DONATED THE CAMPAIGNS SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. AND I SAY RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH ONE OF THE COMMENTS PROP BY THE OPPOSITION I DO NOT THINK THE TRANSPARENCY IS A SCHEME. THERE SHOULD BE A UNIVERSAL CONTRIBUTION DISCLOSURE OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS APPLY TO ALL WITH EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WEREN'T I VOTE FOR THIS BILL. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A AND WHILE I UNDERSTAND OF THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL SEE THE PRISON IT SEE THIS PROVISION OF THE DISCLOSE ACT DEALING WITH MEMBERSHIP DUES AND FEES. TO BE SOME SORT OF LOOPHOLE THE IN FACT THE EXACT OPPOSITE IS TRUE. THAT PROVISION ACTUALLY PREVENTS A LOOPHOLE WHICH WOULD STOP. WHETHER IT'S A LABOR ORGANIZATION OR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OR THE NATIONAL RIFLE RIFLE ASSOCIATION FROM BEING LISTED ON ADS. AND THAT WOULD CREATE LESS DISCLOSURE FOR VOTERS TO KNOW WHICH ORGANIZATION ARE TRYING TO INFLUENCE. THEIR DECISION AND WHAT VOTE THEY MAKE AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. AND AS THE CALVET THE MONEY CAMPAIGN IS TESTIFIED THE ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL WOULD UNDERMINE THE PURPOSES OF THE DISCLOSE ACT. BY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION WILL BE LEFT OFF THE LIST OF TOP FUNDERS THAT MUST APPEAR ON ADVERTISEMENT'S UNDER THE DISCLOSE ACT. SO NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND RECOMMEND AND OPPOSED POSITION. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CULTURAL AND THE MOTIONS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN KNOW BERMAN NO HARPER AYE HARPER AYE CALDERON. LOW. NO NO MULLIN. OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE AYE WEBER. WEBER NOW. SO THAT BILLS ON CALL. IN VICE ARE EVER OF YOU LIKE TO MOVE ON DE. AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY THREE THINK IT FOR MY THIRD OF THREE BILL PRESENTATIONS HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A YES VOTE THE EFFORTS REAL. ABOUT THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HERE TO PRESENT TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE I TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY THREE OF WHICH IS TO REQUIRE BALLOT HARVESTERS WHO COLLECT BOAT BUT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. TO PROVIDE A RECEIPT TO THE VOTER UPON REQUEST IDENTIFYING WHO IS PICKING UP THEIR BALLOT. IN THE PAST VOTERS WERE ALLOWED TO DESIGNATE THEIR TRUSTED FAMILY MEMBERS AND ROOMMATES ARE TO RETURN TO THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT ALSO KNOWN AS A BBM DEL ON THEIR BEHALF. PRIOR LAW SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED CAMPAIGN WORKERS OR OTHER SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS FROM COLLECTING VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS FROM VOTERS. A TACTIC KNOWN AS BALLOT HARVESTING IN ORDER TO PREVENT VOTER CRUSH POTENTIAL VOTER PORTION FRAUD AND NON DELIVERED BALLOTS. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY REPEAL THOSE RESTRICTIONS AND PROVIDED INSTEAD THAT ANY GROUP INCLUDING CAMPAIGN WORKERS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS MAY NOW GO DOOR TO DOOR HARVESTING VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. FROM VOTERS. UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE LEGALIZATION OF BELT HARVESTING THEIR NOW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAMPAIGN OPERATIVES TO INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS. IN THE FIRST ASSEMBLY ELECTION AFTER BALLOT HARVESTING WAS LEGALIZED THERE WERE PUBLISHED REPORTS OF OVERLY AGGRESSIVE BALLOT HARVESTERS HARVESTING IN COURSING VOTERS. TO HAND IN THEIR BALLOTS. IT WHICH REVEALED. WHICH CANDIDATE THEY WERE VOTING FOR. WE HAVE TO WONDER WHY DID THAT BALLOT HARVESTER ASK WHO THE VOTER VOTED FOR. WITH THE HARVEST FIRST THEY'LL DELIVER THE BALLOT IF THE VOTER VOTED FOR THE WRONG CANDIDATE. UNDER CURRENT LAW. IT THE BALLOT HARVESTER DOES NOT DELIVER THE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT TO THE POLLS AND THEREBY DISENFRANCHISE IS THE VOTER THERE IS NOT A WAY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO TRACK DOWN THE PERSON. DOWN FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. NO WAY OF BEING ABLE TO FIND NO PAPER TRAIL. IN RESPONSE. THESE BELT HARVESTING ABUSES THE LOS ANGELES TIMES PUBLISHED IN OUR IN EDITORIAL ENTITLED DON'T ALLOW VOTER CORE XIN AND CORRUPTION TO TAKE HOLD IN CALIFORNIA. NOTING THAT VOTER PROTECTIONS NEEDED TO BE PUT IN PLACE AND THAT LAWMAKERS SHOULD REASSESS THE WISDOM OF ALLOWING UNKNOWN THIRD PARTIES TO COLLECT BALLOTS FROM VOTERS. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THEIR CONCERNS BY REQUIRING CANVASSERS. TO GIVE VOTERS A DETAILED RECEIPT VOTERS WILL FEEL MORE SECURE IN HANDING OVER THEIR BALLOT. THIS ADDED ACCOUNTABILITY WOULD DISCOURAGE ELECTION FRAUD AND ALLOW AUTHORITIES TO IDENTIFY ANYONE WHO INTERFERES WITH AN ABSENTEE BALLOT. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY THREE WILL PROTECT VOTERS BY ENSURING THAT THEIR VOTE IS COUNTED. AND THAT NO ONE DISENFRANCHISE THEM BY FAILING TO DELIVER THEIR BALLOT TO THE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. AGAIN WITH ME HERE TODAY. IS MY GOOD FRIEND IN SUPPORT OF THIS ASSEMBLY BILL DAVID WALL FROM THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I FEEL LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW LIKE GUY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND APPROPRIATIONS HEARING. BAILEY. RIGHT. NOW BUT I DO HAVE A FILE ON THIS BILL MEMBERS AND THAT WE ARE IN SUPPORT TODAY OF AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY TERRY. AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED MEMBERS THAT WE DID OPPOSE THE BELL. THAT LED TO THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY MUCH AS WE DID WITH THE OTHER TWO BILLS THE MISTER HARPER PRESENTED SO WERE ON OBVIOUSLY GOOD PRECEDENT GOOD GROUNDS TO BE HERE TODAY. MEMBERS WERE OBVIOUSLY NOT. IN FAVOR OF DISCOURAGING THEIR DISENFRANCHISEMENT VOTERS IN ANY WAY. I SPEAK TO YOUR HAIR YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE WITH A DISABILITY FOR WHICH AN ABSENTEE BALLOT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL. YOU KNOW PREVIOUS LA BEFORE. YOU KNOW THE PROVISIONS THAT WERE SEEKING TO REPEAL WERE IN PLACE ALLOWED FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THOSE LIVING IN THE SAME RESIDENTS TOGETHER TO TURN IN THESE ABSENTEE BALLOTS AND. YOU KNOW WE THOUGHT THAT WAS COMPLETELY FAIR AND APPROPRIATE AND ESPECIALLY FOR SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE DISABLED. YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THE BALLOTS WERE COUNTED IN A TIMELY MANNER. BUT NOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANYONE BEING ABLE TO TURN IN THESE BALLOTS NOT JUST ANYONE BEING ABLE TO TURN THE MEN BUT INCREASINGLY BEING ABLE TO TURN AND I'M AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF BALLOTS IN TEXAS AT LEAST WHEN IT SAID I THINK. TO TEN ABSENTEE BALLOTS THAT SOMEONE CAN TURN IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF BALLOTS HERE. THERE IS CERTAINLY IS AS MR HARPER MENTIONED AT THE POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD. YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE NOT OUT WE'RE NOT OUTLINED THIS PROCESS BROUGHT FORWARD IN IN THE PREVIOUS BILL WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECEIPT. AND THAT RECEIPT IS GOING TO PROVIDE PEACE OF MIND NOT ONLY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT GIVES THEIR BALLOT TO SOMEONE TO TURN IN FOR THEM. BUT ALSO I THINK TO COUNTY REGISTRARS TO BE ABLE TO AGAIN AS MR HARPER SAID TO HAVE A PAPER TRAIL GOING FORWARD SO WE KNOW HE'S TURNING IN THESE BALLOTS AND WE CAN CATCH. MALFEASANCE IF IT HAPPENS SO I THINK THIS IS A COMPLETELY RATIONAL BILL ASK FOR ANOTHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RICHARD CHAIRMAN OF THE VOTING RIGHTS TASK FORCE YES WE CONSIDER OF THE VOTE BY MAIL TO BE HAVE A VERY WEAK CHAIN OF CUSTODY SO. ALL WE'RE DOING IS GIVING RECEIPTS OF THE VOTERS WHO ASK FOR IT AND I. OF OUR OUR GROUP OF VOTED UNANIMOUSLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WE HAD A VERY MODEST. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ME WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HOPE. SO. OR NEUTRAL. NOT NEW TROLLED NOT FULLY OPPOSING WE HAVE A SUPPORTIVE AMENDED POSITION AKA THEY LOOK FOR THE OPTION. THIS IS THAT ONE OF HOUSING WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE WITNESS HERE SO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE COUNT ON OF THE PEOPLE TO TURN OUR ABOUT. OFTENTIMES IT'S FAMILY MEMBERS OFTENTIMES IT'S KICK CAREGIVERS. AND IF WE REQUIRE THE CAREGIVERS IN THE CIRCLE OF SUPPORT TO FILL OUT THESE RECEIPTS. THEY MAY NOT WANT TO BE. REQUIRED TO FILL OUT ALL THAT IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WHICH THEN WEAKENS THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THE PEOPLE DISABILITIES HAVE. AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE ONE TO HELP THEM TO TURN IN THEIR BALLOT HAVE THEIR VOTE COUNTED. SO WE HAVE REQUESTED IN AN AMENDMENT I THINK IT'S. LAID OUT WELL IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WITHOUT THAT AMENDMENT WE CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BOOK BILL FULLY SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. I DON'T KNOW WHERE ANY MORE OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT OF AMENDED NEWS ROLE. SUPPORT. YEAH PLEASE MY ANGER AND LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU CALIFORNIA WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL LOOKS WE THINK IT CRAFTSMAN AND PERFECT REMEDY TO AN UNVERIFIED PROBLEM. AS THE ANALYSIS LAYS OUT CURRENT LAW ALREADY PROVIDES FOR A VARIETY OF SAFEGUARDS AND PUNISHMENTS TO ADDRESS VOTER FRAUD AND ABUSE IN THE VOTE BY MAIL CONTACTS. THERE WAS MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER IS BELL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AB NINETEEN TWENTY ONE. FAR YOU KNOW FRAUD IMITATION TAMPA TAMPERING WITH VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS ALL HAVE CRIMINAL PENALTIES WERE UNAWARE OF VOTE. LARGE SCALE OR ANY PROBLEM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I'M BEING UNABLE TO TRACK DOWN INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMIT THAT WITH RESPECT TO BOTH BY MAIL BALLOTS WE THINK THE RECEIPT AS DESIGNED IN THIS BILL IS FLAWED FOR ONE IT REQUIRES. THE RETURNING INDIVIDUAL DISCS LESS THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR CALIFORNIA ID NUMBER. AND THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S EVEN REQUIRED TO VOTE MANY PEOPLE IN THIS. STAY IN COUNTRY DON'T HAVE GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION THEY ARE ELDERLY LOW INCOME SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT CAN AFFORD TO GET THIS. LICENSE OR FOR THE UNDERLYING DOCUMENTATION TO GET IT. TWENTY A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SURVEY FOUND THAT ELEVEN PERCENT OF US CITIZENS DON'T HAVE GOVERNMENT ISSUED PHOTO ID. WE ALSO THINK ITS FLAWED BECAUSE IT REQUIRES. A SIGNIFICANT AND PRIVACY INTRUSION IN THAT IT REQUIRES THE PERSON TO LESS THEIR HOME ADDRESS AND I'M RATHER THAN THE ORGANIZATIONAL ADDRESS. AND ALSO FAILS TO FIGURE OUT HOW A PERSON WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THEIR AFFIRMATIVE DUTY TO OFFER AND PROVIDE THIS RECEIPT AND. WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO RECEIVES SAID WHAT ACTUALLY DO WITH THE AND HOW THAT WOULD END UP MATCHING UP WITH THE? I INVESTIGATION OF SUCH A CLAIM SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND THE FLAWS AS THE AND THE BUTLER SPARKLY ASTORINO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE REMEMBER COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS MOTIONS SECONDS. THANK GOT A MOTION AND A SECOND. MISTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I. I THINK THE POINT WAS THAT BROUGHT UP A BY THE OPPOSITION. CAN'T VERIFY THE PROBLEM WITHOUT THE RECEIPT. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. YOU NEED TO HAVE THE PAPER TRAIL TO HAVE PEOPLE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE VOTE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WITHOUT ID'S OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS HERE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS ORGANIZED BALLOT HARVESTING BY SOPHISTICATED POLITICAL OPERATIONS UP WHICH MAY BE DISCARDING VOTES OR MAYBE PRESSURING PEOPLE'S VOTES LIKE IT'S SOME KIND OF UNION CARD CHECK COLLECTION. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE FOR THIS PROCESS I TO BE THE CASE BECAUSE OF THEIR UP POLITICAL TENDENCIES AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY WOULD LIKE THE. THE ELECTRIC TO BE REFLECTED DIE IN FAVOR OF THEIR UP POLITICAL IDEALS. BUT THIS SHOULD BE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL. THE ELECT BALLOT SHOULD HAVE INTEGRITY. PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW WHO IS CARRYING ON THEIR BACK AYE CARING THEIR BALLOT. AND A BUNCH OF BALLOTS GET DUMPED ON TO THE RETRO VOTERS THE RETRO VOTER SHOULD KNOW WHERE IT'S A IT'S A IS A COMING FROM AS WELL. THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO BE RIGHT. TAMMANY HALL STYLE. MODIFICATIONS AND INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS. LET'S HAVE THE RECEIPT. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT'S THE LOOPHOLE VICTOR VICTOR WAS NOT PLUGIN THAT WAS IDENTIFIED BY NGUYEN IS A SAID THE LOS ANGELES TIMES HAD ITSELF OPERA. BALLOT CORE XIN CORRUPTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET'S AVOID IT LET'S STOP IT LET'S NIPPED IN THE BUD LET'S HAVE A RECEIPT. PLEASE VOTE FOR A. B. TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY THREE. THANK YOU MISTER ARBOR. AND WHILE IT WAS A PLEASURE. TO SUPPORT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF YOUR BILLS AT THE LAST HEARING. I MUST OPPOSE A HUNDRED PERCENT OF YOUR BILLS AT THIS HEARING. ASIDE FROM THE LOGISTICAL ISSUES PRESENTED BY THIS BILL I'M UNSURE HOW VOTER FRAUD OF THIS TYPE WOULD BE PREVENTED BY REQUIRING IT DOESN'T NEED TO PROVIDE A VOTE BY MAIL VOTER WITH A RECEIPT.
