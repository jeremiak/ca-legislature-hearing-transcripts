USING A NEW COST ESTIMATES THAT

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:30.189

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:51.723
THANK YOU CENTER AND THANK YOU

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.025
RACHEL PLAYED A HIGH LEVEL THE

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:55.160
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- THE COST

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:57.095
ESTIMATE THAT WE PRODUCED FOR

00:19:57.162 --> 00:19:58.697
THE BROADBAND ACTION PLAN WAS

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:01.099
BASED ON A COST MODEL. AND IT

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:03.135
USED- DISTANCE BETWEEN

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:05.604
LOCATIONS AS THE CROW FLIES SO.

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:08.206
ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:09.908
FROM POINT A TO POINT B. IN THE

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:11.443
AIR AS OPPOSED TO USING ACTUAL

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.878
ROAD MILES SO THAT'S THE

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:14.780
PRIMARY DIFFERENCE. ANOTHER

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:16.448
DIFFERENCE IS THE MIX OF

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:17.883
UNDERGROUND VERSES AERIAL THAT

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.352
WE USE SO. THE NUMBER THAT WE

00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:21.887
HAVE FOR NOW BUT FOR BILLING IS

00:20:21.954 --> 00:20:24.156
BASED ON UNDERGROUND PRIMARILY

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:26.491
AS OPPOSED TO A LARGER MAKES AN

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.293
AERIAL PERSONS UNDERGROUND SO

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.128
WE SEE THAT NUMBER. EVENTUALLY

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:34.199
CHANGING AS WE GET DOWN TO

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:34.933
IMPLEMENTATION. WELL EVEN A GUY

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.134
LIKE ME RESTAURANTS FOR KNOWS

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:37.536
THAT UNDERGROUND COST A WHOLE

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:40.072
LOT MORE MONEY THAN THAN THAN

00:20:40.138 --> 00:20:42.474
ARIEL AND- THE BRINGS US TO THE

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.610
THIRD POINTED THE L. A. O.

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:45.978
RACES THAT. WHAT WE'RE GOING

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:49.081
FOR BIG ADDITIONS CHANGES THEY

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:50.115
SUGGEST THAT MAYBE SOME OF

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:52.017
THESE WHY NOT FOCUS ON SOME OF

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:54.519
THE SHORT TERM. FIXES WERE IT'S

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:55.754
JUST A MATTER PEOPLE NOT BEING

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:56.955
ABLE TO AFFORD THE INTERNET I

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.223
MEAN THEY THEY SAY THEY DON'T

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.491
HAVE THE INTERNET AND WE KNOW

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:00.859
THAT THEIR- THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:01.893
FOR A LOT OF THE PROBLEM THAT

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.695
WE'VE AT. LEAST THAT WE'VE

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:04.763
LEARNED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.732
IS PEOPLE JUST NEED AN UPGRADE

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:08.367
OF THEIR THE SYSTEM THAT THE

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.135
THIRD VICTIM THEIR HOUSES IT'S

00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:11.536
CRASHING. IN THE WHITE HOUSE

00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:12.437
THE HOUSE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:14.473
THAT ONE MY- WIFE WORKING ON

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:15.907
HER DISSERTATION AND MY SON

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:18.110
WORKING ON HIS THESIS IS. THAT

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:22.981
TIME FOR THE SENATOR SO WHY.

00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:24.182
NOT PUT SOME FOCUS ON THAT. SO

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:25.350
THERE'S A COUPLE ELEMENT BUT

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:26.918
WE'RE FOCUSING ON AS WELL TO

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:28.754
ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM THE FIRST

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.589
IS ON THE LIFELINE SIDE WHERE

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:31.857
IT WILL CONSIDERING WAYS THAT

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:33.125
WE AND THERE'S ALREADY A

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:34.292
FEDERAL PROGRAM UNDER WAY RIGHT

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:36.028
NOW FOR THE EMERGENCY BROADBAND

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:37.229
BENEFIT THAT IS LOOKING TO

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:38.930
SUBSIDIZE BROADBAND FOR LOW

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:41.333
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. ON THE

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.036
AFFORDABILITY BY. THE PROBLEM

00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:46.004
THAT WE SEE IS. IN COMMUNITIES

00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:47.606
THAT DON'T HAVE BROADBAND FORD

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:49.341
ABILITY AS AN OPTION BECAUSE

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:51.209
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND WHAT

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:52.944
THIS MIDDLE MOM PROPOSAL WILL

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:55.881
DO. IS PROVIDE OPTIONS FOR LAST

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:57.282
MILE PROVIDERS SO THAT YOU

00:21:57.349 --> 00:21:59.151
DON'T HAVE A ONE PROVIDER ONE

00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:01.620
TOWN SITUATION- THE OPEN ACCESS

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:05.390
ALLOWS. MULTIPLE PROVIDERS TO.

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:07.292
IF WE GET ON THE NETWORK ACCESS

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:08.460
TO COMMUNITIES SO WITH WITH

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:09.961
SERVE MATCH WITH HOUSEHOLDS BUT

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:13.265
ALSO LIBRARY PUBLIC SAFETY-

00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:15.067
HOSPITALS ALL THE COMMUNITY

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:17.269
ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SO THE

00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:17.869
FOCUS IS REALLY UP SERVING THE

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:20.072
WHOLE COMMUNITY. I DO HAVE SOME

00:22:20.138 --> 00:22:21.740
IDEAS JUST FOR US AS A WORKING

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:23.308
MODEL HOW MUCH OF YOU KNOW WE

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.876
HAVE A DEFICIENCY OKAY THAT'S

00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:27.112
GREAT HOW MUCH OF THAT IS. THE

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.214
BILL. COMMUNITY OR THE BILL

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:31.116
MIDDLE MILE AND HOW MUCH OF

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:33.318
THAT IS JUST THIS. LOCALIZE I

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:34.920
CAN'T AFFORD THE BROADBAND OR

00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:36.188
YOU KNOW THE BROADBAND RUNS

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:37.756
RIGHT PAST MY HOUSE I JUST. I'M

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.391
NOT IN ON IT BECAUSE WHEN WE

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:42.728
WHEN WE HEAR THESE NUMBERS

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:43.328
RECEIVING NUMBERS AND THIS AND

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:45.197
THAT. NEWSPAPER ON THE RADIO

00:22:45.263 --> 00:22:46.631
IT'S A GIGANTIC NUMBER YOU'VE

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:49.034
FIFTH MISS PETRSON. TOLD US

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:50.836
ABOUT IT BUT HOW MUCH OF THAT

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:53.472
IS REALLY JUST. APPLE COMPUTER

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:54.973
ALL UP WITH SOME SORT OF

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.008
MINIMUM FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH

00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:58.910
CHARGE THAT THEY HAVE THEIR

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:02.147
BROADBAND VERSUS THIS- TURN UP

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:03.215
THE ROAD AND BRING IN THE

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:04.683
MIDDLE MILE AND CREATED THIS

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.552
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:09.755
LAST MILE YOU KNOW PROVIDERS.

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.423
HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE

YOU MORE DETAILS ON THAT

00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:15.193
SENATOR. ON THE WITH THE GAP

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.528
BETWEEN WHERE YOU HAVE

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:19.364
AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM PERSISTS

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:20.899
AND ACCESS PROBLEM. AND YOU

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:23.001
THINK THAT BY THE HAVING THIS

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.669
OPEN ACCESS FOR THE MIDDLE MILE

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:27.172
SORT OF. EQUALIZES THINGS A

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:28.340
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT FEEL

00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:30.776
LIKE THEY'RE BEING LEFT OUT OF

00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:33.111
THE BIG BROADBAND GAME. IS AT

00:23:33.178 --> 00:23:35.113
THAT IS THAT THE THEORY THERE

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.283
AT THE CPUC. THAT'S CORRECT SO

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.152
THE MINIMUM PROPOSAL IS BASED

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:40.986
ON CONNECTING ALL THE

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:42.687
HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE BEEN ARE

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.389
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A HUNDRED

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:46.491
MEGABITS PER SECOND AND- SO WE

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:49.394
PUT THAT THAT PLAN TOGETHER.

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:50.061
AND IT RUNS ALONG STATE

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:51.763
HIGHWAYS WHEN WE ARE

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.931
IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN WE

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:54.933
OBVIOUSLY WILL FOCUS NOT JUST

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.635
ON STATE RIGHT AWAY BUT ALSO.

00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:58.003
CITY AND COUNTY AND PRIVATE

00:23:58.069 --> 00:24:00.605
RIGHT THE WAY- BUT THE BENEFIT

00:24:00.672 --> 00:24:02.808
FOR THE MIDDLE MILE UP PROPOSAL

00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:04.142
INCLUDE NOT JUST CONNECTING THE

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:05.777
HOUSEHOLDS BUT PROVIDING BUT

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:07.579
CONNECTIVITY SO THAT PEOPLE

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:10.215
CAN. DO THEIR WORK THEY CAN DO-

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.384
TELEWORK TELEMEDICINE ACCESS

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.052
GOVERNMENT SERVICES IT ALSO

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.387
PROMOTES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

00:24:15.453 --> 00:24:17.022
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT AS- A

00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:18.790
BASELINE THAT PUBLIC CONNECTED.

00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:20.492
CITIZENRY AS OPPOSED TO HAVING

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:21.927
THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS WHICH

00:24:21.993 --> 00:24:23.128
THE SITUATION WE'RE IN RIGHT

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:27.532
NOW. GOTCHA- LET'S HEAR FROM.

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:29.267
RURAL CENTERED RECOGNIZED YOU

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:31.102
MISTER CHAIRMAN OVER HERE JUST

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:34.239
ABOUT TO LOSE IT- FIRST OFF I

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.775
WANT TO TALK MISTER CALDERON UP

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:38.643
SOME I'M AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.745
BROADBAND FOR MINUTE. AND I

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:41.346
THINK THE INTENT LANGUAGE IT

00:24:41.413 --> 00:24:43.448
NEEDS TO BE WE NEED TO HAVE THE

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:44.149
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND I

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:46.518
THINK IT IS TIME FOR US TO

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.486
REALLY CONNECT AND BUT THIS IS

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:49.287
THAT THIS THE DEVIL'S IN THE

00:24:49.354 --> 00:24:51.957
DETAILS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:54.459
HOW WE'RE GOING TO. IF YOU GO

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:55.961
LOOK AT DIGITAL THREE NINETY

00:24:56.027 --> 00:24:57.662
FIVE WHICH I DON'T KNOW HOW

00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:58.230
MANY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

00:24:58.296 --> 00:24:59.497
DOLLARS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:00.765
PUT IN THERE I THINK THERE'S

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:02.234
LIKE ONE PERSON HOOKED UP. IT'S

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.104
THE- IT'S THE ABILITY TO GET ON

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:09.241
THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN IT'S IN

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:12.110
PLACE AND I'M FROM A RURAL

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.612
COMMUNITY AND I AND I REPRESENT

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:15.447
MOST OF THE RULES THE SOME OF

00:25:15.513 --> 00:25:17.182
THE RULES PARTS OF THE STATE

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:18.316
THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:20.685
THEIR- PRIVATE COMPANIES LET ME

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:23.221
GIVE AN EXAMPLE. THE RAIL LINE

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:26.725
RUNS UP. BOB TWO FIVE FIVE AND

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:27.525
THERE'S A RAIL LINE THAT GOES

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:30.161
ALL THE WAY TO WASHINGTON IN

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:30.762
EIGHTEEN T. HAS A LINE THAT

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:32.130
RUNS RIGHT TO DUNN'S MERE THAT

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.365
IS HI SPEED INTERNET WHICH

00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:35.033
CONNECTS THE WESTERN PART OF

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.668
THE UNITED STATES. AND MY

00:25:36.735 --> 00:25:37.903
COMMUNITY COULD NOT HAVE GONE

00:25:37.969 --> 00:25:39.404
TO THAT LINE BECAUSE THEY JUST

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:40.138
DON'T THAT THAT DOES NOT IN THE

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:42.007
BUSINESS PLAN. WE DO CAST A

00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:43.575
FUNDS WE DO ALL KINDS OF

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:45.810
OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO CONNECT

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:47.946
RULE AMERICA. AND WE'RE NOT

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:49.781
GETTING IT DONE I THINK THIS

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.049
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS SHOULD BE

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:52.117
PUT IN THERE BUT THE DEVIL'S IN

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:53.318
THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW WE GO

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:55.754
ABOUT IT WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.656
THE MIDDLE MILE- CAN'T CONNECT

00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.157
pTO IT DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD.

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:02.027
IF AND I. ASK YOU TO GO LOOK AT

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:03.128
DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE AND

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:04.329
FIGURE OUT HOW MANY. HUNDREDS

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:05.130

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:06.631
MANY PEOPLE SERVICE. THIS IS

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:07.933
NOT A GOOD USE FOR MONEY WE

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:08.867
NEED TO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT HOW

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:10.669
TO GET. PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:13.438

DELIVERS MIGHT. THE FOR

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:58.669
DECISIONS ON THIS PACKAGE UNTIL

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:00.270
THIS SUMMER- IS THAT WOULD

00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:02.439
ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO. LEARN

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.173
MORE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL'S

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.209
ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF THE NEW

00:44:05.275 --> 00:44:06.543
PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES THAT

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:07.111
ARE PART OF THIS PARTICULAR

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:09.813
PACKAGE- CRAFT IMPLEMENTING

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.016
STATUTORY LANGUAGE TO ENSURE

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:12.783
SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT AND

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.119
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND TO ENSURE

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:16.020
THAT ALSO INCORPORATES KEY

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:18.122
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AS WE

00:44:18.188 --> 00:44:20.991
JUST DISCUSSED- MORE- KIND OF

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:22.726
SPECIFICALLY I GUESS JUST SORT

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:23.527
OF THOSE THE SPECIFICS OF THE

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:25.796
PROPOSAL. I WE DO THINK THAT

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:26.296
YOU KNOW IT'S GENERALLY

00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:27.297
TARGETED AT PROMOTING

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:28.532
TECHNOLOGIES IN AREAS THAT

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.234
MIGHT BE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.502
CARBONIZATION GOALS THE

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:34.571
CALIFORNIA HAS SET- BUT WORK

00:44:34.638 --> 00:44:36.073
COMMERCIAL SCALE TECHNOLOGIES

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.307
MIGHT NOT YET BE AVAILABLE AND

00:44:37.374 --> 00:44:39.243
SO. WE THINK- YOU KNOW THAT

00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:40.677
KIND OF FOCUS IS REASONABLE AND

00:44:40.744 --> 00:44:42.446
CONCEPTS- BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:43.547
QUESTIONS AND DETAILS THAT

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:45.049
STILL. NEED TO BE WORKED OUT

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:47.051
AND ANSWERED. A COUPLE THAT ALL

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:49.720
HIGHLIGHTS. ONE OF A KIND OF

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:51.655
KEY QUESTION TO THINK ABOUT IS.

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:52.890
IS GENERAL FUND AN APPROPRIATE

00:44:52.956 --> 00:44:54.058
SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THESE

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:55.926
ACTIVITIES ARE TYPICALLY IN

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:56.860
THESE TYPES OF KIND OF CLEAN

00:44:56.927 --> 00:44:58.395
ENERGY ACTIVITIES ARE FUNDED

00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:00.297
DIRECTLY OR FUNDING OR OTHER

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.599
SPECIAL FUNDS. HOWEVER WE DO

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:04.034
THINK IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:04.802
THINK ABOUT USING ONE TIME

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:05.969
GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:07.938
RATEPAYER FUNDING. FOR SOME OF

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:08.672
THE ACTIVITIES AT LEAST

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:09.807
INCLUDING THE INCENTIVES AND

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:13.310
GRANTS- THIS IS. PARTLY BECAUSE

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.812
AT AS MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.713
WHAT CHRISTIE RATES ARE ALREADY

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.382
VERY HIGH WHICH RACES. ARE

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:19.817
QUITE A FEW CONCERNS AROUND

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:20.717
SORT OF JUST ENVIRONMENT

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:21.885
ACHIEVING OF OUR MIDDLE GOALS

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.387
ARE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES IN

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:25.322
EQUITY CONCERNS. SO USING

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.156
GENERAL FUND INSTEAD COULD

00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:28.492
PREVENT FUTURE. RATE INCREASES

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.094
RATHER THAN KIND OF RELYING ON.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.262
ELECTRICITY RATEPAYERS. ALSO

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:33.664
MANY OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAMS

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.165
ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE BROAD

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:36.500
PUBLIC BENEFITS WHICH MEANS

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:37.367
THERE COULD BE A REASONABLE

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:39.369
CASE AND I'M ROLE FOR A STATE

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:41.271
GENERAL FUND SUPPORT- AND I

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:43.006
THINK I THINK THE ARGUMENT FOR

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:44.007
GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR SOME

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:44.475
OF THE OTHER PLANNING

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:51.882
ACTIVITIES I. THINK IT'S AN

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:52.349
ISSUE THAT WE'RE STILL

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:52.983
EXPLORING OR NOT. ENTIRELY SURE

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:53.617
ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK FOR SOME

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:55.519
OF THE- ON SERVICE. THERE IS A

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:56.920
REASONABLE ARE- THE SECOND

00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:58.655
QUESTION- THEN I'LL IN MY FROM

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:00.691
OR- IS HOW MUCH IS. SHOULD BE

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:01.525
PLACED ON. INCREMENTAL IF

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:03.026
THEY'RE GAINS AS PART OF THESE

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.895
PROGRAMS. VERSUS PROMOTING

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:07.197
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:08.932
FOR DEEP DECARBONIZATION- SOME

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.100
OF THE PROGRAMS LIKE THE

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:11.301
INDUSTRIAL PROPOSED INDUSTRIAL

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:13.604
DECARBONISATION PROGRAM WOULD.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:14.771
MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR BOTH

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.140
OF THESE THINGS BOTH ENERGY

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:17.841
EFFICIENCY AS WELL AS- A NEWER

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:19.042
TECHNOLOGIES LIKE GREEN

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:20.911
HYDROGEN OR CARBON CAPTURE FOR

00:46:20.978 --> 00:46:23.547
EXAMPLE- ANYTHING IN GENERAL WE

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:24.615
THINK PROMOTING EARLY STAGE

00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:26.116
TECHNOLOGIES AGAIN IS IT A

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:27.651
REASONABLE AREA OF FOCUS BUT

00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:28.519
THERE IS KIND OF A TRADE OFF

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.787
THAT THOSE. TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:32.789
MORE EXPENSIVE AND FOCUSING ON

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:33.991
ENERGY EFFICIENCY MIGHT BE A

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:35.926
MORE. COST EFFECTIVE NEAR TERM

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:38.028
STRATEGY- SO THAT'S JUST KIND

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:38.996
OF ONE OF THE TRADE OFFS I

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.230
THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:41.265
THINKING ABOUT IN WAYNE WHEN

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:42.432
STRUCTURING THESE PROGRAMS IF

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:43.934
FUNDING IS PROVIDED. HOW IT

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:45.202
WANTS TO WAY KIND OF SOME OF

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:46.637
THOSE LONG TERM GOALS IN

00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:47.204
PROMOTING NEW OR INNOVATIVE

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:50.474
TECHNOLOGIES. AGAINST COMMITTEE

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:51.675
ON PERHAPS MORE COST EFFECTIVE

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:53.110
BUT SORT OF SHORT TERM GOALS

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:55.245
ARE. AND PROJECTS AROUND ENERGY

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:56.980
EFFICIENCY. SO WE HAVE A

00:46:57.047 --> 00:46:57.881
SEVERAL OTHER COMMENTS OR

00:46:57.948 --> 00:46:58.916
QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.717
THEY'RE LAID OUT IN YOUR AGENDA

00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:02.286
BUT I'M NOT IN THE INTEREST OF

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:03.487
TIME- IN MY COMMENTS THERE. THE

00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:05.289
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU COULD

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:08.825
TO TOUCH MINE. WE YOU'VE TOURED

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:11.228
US FOR YEARS ABOUT- THE CAP AND

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:12.329
TRADE PROGRAMS ARE COVERED

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:13.697
ENTITIES INCLUDING THE FOOD

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:16.366
PROCESSING. INDUSTRY THAT THEY

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:18.802
SHOULD THERE EMITTERS A CARBON

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:19.903
DAY SHOULD PAY THEIR OWN WAY

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.805
AND WE KNOW WE HAVE. A CARVE

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:23.373
OUT THE CAP AND TRADE TO PAY

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.242
FOR THEIR MANUFACTURES TAXES SO

00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:26.743
THEY DON'T PAY THIRTY TWO

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:34.184
MILLION. DOLLARS AND THAT THIS

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:35.686
IS. FOR YOU KNOW FOR PROCESSING

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:36.887
TO REACH. A CAR FELL TO REDO

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.288
THEIR AND- YOU IS. WHAT AN

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:39.656
COMPANY TO. INCREASE IN THE

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:40.924
FLOW PRICE ON THE CAP AND TRADE

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:42.259
IS SORT OF FIFTY THAT THAT

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:44.027
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE IS A- A

00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:45.329
BALANCE BETWEEN OKAY WE'RE

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:46.630
GONNA GIVE YOU THIS BUT THEN.

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:48.966
YOU COULD PAY MORE EVERYBODY

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:51.201
WILL PAY MORE. I'M GOING TO

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:52.703
HEAR FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:54.605
AND WHAT THEY THINK IT'S- WITH.

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:56.273
WHY SHOULD WE BE DOING THAT IS

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:56.974
A LEGISLATIVE WHY SHOULD BE

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.375
LOOKING AT ONE INDUSTRY

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:00.577
ADMITTEDLY IT MIGHT BE LOCATED

00:48:00.644 --> 00:48:02.412
IN A LOW INCOME AREA AND IT

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:03.780
MEDICALLY IT MAY BE A GOOD

00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:07.584
ENERGY. A BIG ENERGY. USER BUT

00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:09.486
WHY WOULD WE- WHY WOULD WE WANT

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:11.521
TO. FOCUS JUST ON THAT ONE

00:48:11.588 --> 00:48:15.325
INDUSTRY. YES I THINK THERE ARE

00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:16.593
A COUPLE IS KIND OF IMPORTANT

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.695
POINTS ON THAT QUESTION ONE IS

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:21.265
JUST KIND OF BROADLY- YOU KNOW

00:48:21.331 --> 00:48:22.666
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF CAP AND

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.501
TRADE VERSUS YOU KNOW A STATE

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:26.637
FUNDING PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE

00:48:26.703 --> 00:48:28.338
TECHNOLOGY OR SUPPORT A CERTAIN

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:29.973
TYPES OF INDUSTRIES I THINK.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.608
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION A POINT

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.310
THAT WE RAISED BEFORE AND WE DO

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:34.911
THANK THE KIND OF TRYING TO

00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:36.280
PROMOTE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

00:48:36.346 --> 00:48:37.881
EMISSION REDUCTIONS THE STATE'S

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.716
FOCUS SHOULD LARGELY BE ON I

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:40.817
HAVE BEEN TRAINED CAP AND TRADE

00:48:40.884 --> 00:48:42.686
PROGRAM IS SET UP IN A WAY. TO

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.054
DO THAT AND IN A WAY THAT'S

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:45.589
CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:47.991
GOALS NOW THERE MAY STILL BE-

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:49.793
HAVE A GOOD RATIONALE FOR OTHER

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.595
PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON THINGS

00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:53.063
THAT MAYBE CAP AND TRADE

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:53.897
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY

00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:55.098
INCENTIVIZE BUT ARE STILL KIND

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:57.701
OF NEEDED OR NEW TECHNOLOGIES

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:58.635
THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED BUT A

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.003
COUNTRY DOESN'T DO A GREAT JOB

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.772
OF COVERING AND HANDLING AND

00:49:01.838 --> 00:49:03.740
SO. PROGRAMS LIKE THIS TO KIND

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:05.075
OF PROMOTE YOU KNOW NEWER

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:06.610
TECHNOLOGIES IN DEMONSTRATIONS

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:08.545
MIGHT BE KIND OF A GOOD FIT FOR

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:09.646
YOU SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:10.714
TO GO ALONGSIDE CONCENTRATE

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:12.349
AGAIN ASSUMING AS WE TALKED

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:13.383
ABOUT BEFORE COUNTRY TO SET UP

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.885
AND IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT

00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:16.586
WITH THE STATE'S GOALS. THAT'S

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:18.522
ONE THING I THINK THE OTHER THE

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:19.256
OTHER ISSUE THAT YOU RAISED

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:20.891
SOME I WAS ALSO ONE OF OUR

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.225
COMMENTS THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:24.961
AGENDA AS BY THE ARGUMENT FOR-

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:26.797
PROVIDING A SPECIFIC CAR ABOUT

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:28.465
PROGRAMMER FUNDING FOR A

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:31.868
PARTICULAR INDUSTRY SO- AS YOU

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:34.171
NOTED THERE'S A PROGRAM FOR

00:49:34.237 --> 00:49:35.372
INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.808
ACTIVITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES AND

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:38.408
THERE'S A SEPARATE PROGRAM FOR

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:40.744
FOOD PROCESSING- INDUSTRIES AND

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:43.280
SO I THINK- I THINK THAT A GOOD

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:44.581
QUESTION I AM ONE OF THE

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:51.688
QUESTIONS. THAT WAS ON OUR MIND

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:52.789
WAS- WHAT IS THE SORT OF THE

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:53.890
RATIONALE FOR. UNNECESSARY

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:55.058
FOCUS ON JUST THE PROCESS

00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:55.592
INDUSTRY RATHER THAN JUST

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.494
WALKING ABOUT MY INTO ONE. OF

00:49:57.561 --> 00:49:58.962
PROGRAM. AND FUNDING TO THE

00:49:59.029 --> 00:50:00.230
MOST MERITORIOUS. WITHIN THE

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:01.431
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND SOME OF

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:02.666
THOSE LIKE A FOOD PROCESSING

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:04.234
BUT SOME OF IT MIGHT BE OTHER

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:05.369
PROGRAMS AND SO. ANYTHING ABOUT

00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:07.170
THE DESIGN AND STRUCTURE OF

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:07.904
FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS WE

00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:09.339
THINK THAT'S- KIND OF ONE

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:11.141
IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK AND I

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.576
THINK ABOUT. HOW TO STRUCTURE

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:13.844
THEM IN A WAY THAT KIND OF GETS

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:14.644
OUT THE MOST MERITORIOUS

00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:15.645
PROJECTS WOULDN'T YOU'RE

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:17.914
THINKING BEAT SINCE WE HAVE 80%

00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:19.950
OF THE MANUFACTURES ARE COVERED

00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:22.018
UNDER CAP AND TRADE. AT

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:24.121
TARGETING THE OTHER 20% SORT OF

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:26.056
THE SLOW LOPE PLAYERS THAT ARE

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:27.557
ENERGY INEFFICIENT. OR THAT

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:29.259
NEEDED DECARBONISATION AT THAT

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.828
WOULD BE. A WISE WISE

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:34.931
INVESTMENT. TO MOVE THAT

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:37.100
SECTOR. ASIDE I MEAN WE'RE NOT.

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:38.168
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:39.569
DON'T GIVE ANYTHING TO THE

00:50:39.636 --> 00:50:40.637
COVERED ENTITIES TO DECARBONISE

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:42.939
THEM. BE NICE THAT WE USE OUR

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.474
CAP AND TRADES TO ACTUALLY

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.575
DECARBONIZE THE COMMUNITY

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:47.310
RATHER THAN. WORK AFTER

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:48.311
POLLUTION AND OTHER PROJECTS

00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:50.547
THAT ARE. WONDERFUL BUT THEY

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.649
DON'T DO THE JOB OF. THAT IS

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:58.989
THAT IT IS AT A TARGET ARE.

00:50:59.055 --> 00:50:59.556
TARGETED IF WE DO GO FORWARD

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:00.557
WITH THIS. LONG TERM. DICKER

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:01.158
EFFORTS AT SHOULD BE LOOK AT

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:03.293
THOSE ANTI ENTITIES. COVERED

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.263
ENTITIES. YEAH I THINK THAT'S

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:07.497
THAT'S ONE OF KIND OF THE

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.499
PRINCIPLES IN AREAS THAT WE I

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:12.169
THINK WE'VE OUTLINED THAT IS-

00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:13.904
WHAT ARE SORT OF REASONABLE

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.071
AREA OF FOCUS ON KIND OF

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.339
FOCUSING ON THOSE ENTITIES THAT

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:17.741
ARE NOT COVERED LIKE YOU SAID I

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.376
DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE A SENSE

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:20.844
TO MAKE IT MINISTRATION DOES ON

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.647
KIND OF HOW MANY. ENTITIES THAT

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.148
WOULD CAP THAT WOULD CAPTURE

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:26.016
KIND OF THIS PART OF THIS

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:27.083
PROPOSAL HOW MANY SORT OF

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.553
SMALLER- INDUSTRIAL SOURCES ARE

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.121
KIND OF OUTSIDE OF THE CAPITAL

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:32.989
I THINK ONE THAT IS ONE

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:34.191
REASONABLE SORT OF AREA TO

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:35.859
EXPLORE AND ONE KIND OF

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:37.194
REASONABLE CRITERIA TO USE TO.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.762
PART OF THE FUNDING IN ADDITION

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:39.963
TO EVEN FOR THE LARGE PLAYERS

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.631
THATARE COVERED AS WE JUST

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.633
TALKED ABOUT- BUT IT THERE'S

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.335
SORT OF A- PILOT AND

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:47.971
DEMONSTRATION OF RATIONALE AND

00:51:48.038 --> 00:51:50.841
TECHNOLOGICAL- KIND OF

00:51:50.907 --> 00:51:52.676
PROMOTION ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:53.977
WHICH MEANS EVEN IF THEY ARE

00:51:54.044 --> 00:51:55.479
COVERED WE DO THINK THERE IS.

00:51:55.545 --> 00:51:56.980
SOME REASONABLE RATIONALE FOR

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:57.647
GOING TO THE STATE PLAYING A

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:58.915
ROLE IN AN AND PROMOTING THOSE

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:00.116
TYPES OF THINGS FINANCING

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:01.818
DELIVERY SPONSORED COMMISSIONER

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:06.089

AN EXPERT ON A CAP AND TRADE

00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:18.268
WHAT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT FOR

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:20.003
ME IS VERY DIFFICULT TO THE

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.205
CARBONIZED SECTORS AND WE'RE

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:24.107
WE'RE LOOKING FOR TECHNOLOGICAL

00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:26.042
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE YOU KNOW

00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:30.213
STILL NATION. THAT THAT CAP AND

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.815
TRADE DOESN'T DO A GOOD JOB OF

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:33.483
INCENTIVIZING THOSE DEEP

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:36.019
DECARBONIZATION INVESTMENTS

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:37.320
THAT WE WILL NEED. THE SAME

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:38.488
THING N THE TRANSPORTATION

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:39.723
SECTOR WHERE IT'S NOT EASY TO

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:41.358
SWITCH ONE FUEL TO ANOTHER

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:43.860
EXPENSIVE AND THERE'S- THERE'S

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:44.628
A LEARNING CURVE AND THERE'S A

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:48.198
COST THERE. AND SO WE WILL- YOU

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:50.066
KNOW INVESTORS THAT ARE REALLY

00:52:50.133 --> 00:52:51.568
TARGETED. AND I THINK

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:53.770
INDUSTRIAL IS WHERE WE DON'T

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:56.373
HAVE A SOLUTION SET YET FULLY

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:58.441

INVESTMENTS ARE REALLY TO HELP

00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:02.712

INVESTMENTS I MEAN ENERGY

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:10.854
EFFICIENCY AS PART OF THAT

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:12.355
BECAUSE THAT REDUCES THE AMOUNT

00:53:12.422 --> 00:53:13.356
OF ENERGY THAT WE HAVE TO USE

00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:15.992
FOR THESE. THESE ABOUT- MORE

THE SHORT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:59.075
IS YES OUR PROPOSAL WOULD

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:02.579

ASSIGNED A COUPLE HEARINGS

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.206
RECENTLY ON THIS TOPIC SO I

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:25.841
WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:27.609
BUT MONIES AS IS GENERALLY

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.311
CONSISTENT WITH VARIOUS STATE

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:30.779
KLEINER QUALITY GOALS

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.047
ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.849
AS TRANSPORTATION AS A AS A

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:34.583
MAJOR SOURCE OF THOSE

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.251
EMISSIONS. HOWEVER BEFORE

01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:37.686
APPROVING ALL OR SOME OF THIS

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:38.854
PACKAGE WOULD MAKE THE

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:39.955
LEGISLATURE ONE I'M SURE THE

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:41.790
PACKAGE IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.625
KIND OF BROADER FINER QUALITY

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:45.728
STRATEGIES AS WELL AS ENSURING

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:46.428
THAT THERE IS AN ADEQUATE

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:48.630
PROCESS IN PLACE TO EVALUATE

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.766
PROGRAM OUTCOMES SO MY PROVIDE

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:51.500
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:52.935
ONSOME OF THOSE COMMENTS AND

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.069
I. AND A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:57.106
SO WHEN HIGHLIGHT I REALLY FOUR

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:58.774
G. QUESTIONS BASED ON OUR

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:01.443
PRELIMINARY REVIEW. FIRST IS

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:02.745
ARE THE PROPOSED SPENDING

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:04.747
CATEGORIES AND PROGRAM DESIGNS

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:05.914
CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:10.085
PRIORITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE- THIS

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.820
PACKAGE I'M NOT A MONEY WOULD

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:12.755
GO TO HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.623
PROGRAMS THAT'S ABOUT ONE POINT

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:16.258
ONE BILLION COMPARED TO LIGHT

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:17.826
DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS WHICH

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.027
WOULD GET ABOUT SIX HUNDRED

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.596
MILLION. SO ALMOST TWICE AS

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:22.998
MUCH FOR HEAVY DUTY ALSO THE

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.234
PROPOSED FUNDING FOR CVR P.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.536
WOULD- GO TO ENTIRELY TO THE

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:28.971
LOW AND MODERATE INCOME PORTION

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:31.039
OF THE PROGRAM. OUR ELIGIBILITY

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:33.342
IS ONLY UP 24100% OF THE

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:33.976
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO THAT'S

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.811
A YOU CAN CHANGE FROM KIND OF

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:38.747
THE BROADER CTRP PROGRAM AND-

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:41.183
IS A MUCH LOWER INCOME CUTS FOR

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.484
ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE REBATES.

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:43.619
THE LEGISLATURE WE JUST WANT TO

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:44.820
INSURE THAT THOSE SPENDING

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:46.155
ALLOCATIONS AND PROGRAM DESIGNS

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:47.589
ALIGN WITH ITS PRIORITIES

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:49.591
HOWEVER MUCH MONEY IT ENDS UP-

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:52.694
ALLOCATING. I SECONDS HOW WILL

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:55.130
THE PROGRAMS BE EVALUATED- AS

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:56.698
NOTED IN PRIOR REPORTS MORE

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:58.200
OFFICE AND OTHERS THERE IS

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.635
LIMITED RELIABLE INFORMATION ON

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:01.336
THE RELATIVE COST EFFECTIVENESS

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:03.138
ORANGE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:03.639
TRANSPORTATION EMISSION

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:05.207
REDUCTION PROGRAMS. THE

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.809
LEGISLATURE WARRANTED CONSIDER

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:15.851
MAYBE REQUIRING. THE

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:16.418
ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:16.952
PLAN. ACTING CONSUL WITH

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:17.586
OUTSIDE RESEARCHERS TACKLE THE

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:18.854
NEST DATA. AND EVALUATE OUR OF

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.322
THE PRO BOTH THE FUN OF THE WAR-

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:21.223
WHICH COULD ENSURE THAT THERE'S

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:22.324
GOING TO. OF WHAT'S THE- AND

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:23.592
FUTURE YEARS ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:24.159
GETTING FOR THIS. OF WORKING

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:27.362
WELL AND WHAT ISN'T. THIRD-

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:28.897
SHOULD THE FUND FOR THE HEAVY

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.632
DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS BOTH

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:31.867
VEHICLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE BE

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:34.169
SPLIT BETWEEN CARBON CC HEARD

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:36.271
THAT- THE PROPOSAL WOULD

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.307
INCLUDE FUNDING FOR- BOTH OF

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:39.641
THOSE AGENCIES WHEN IT COMES

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.844
TO- DRAYAGE TRUCKS. TRANSIT

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:44.146
BUSES AND SCHOOL BUSES SO CC

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:45.647
WILL GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:46.915
PORTION OF THAT FUNDING AND CAR

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.684
WOULD GET THE- FUNDING FOR THE

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:52.487
VEHICLES- AND SWELL THIS. HAS

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:53.322
TRADITIONALLY SORT OF BEEN THE

01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:54.656
SPLIT ON THE LIGHT DUTY SIDE OF

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:55.724
THINGS WERE CARD GETS THE

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.392
FUNDING FOR VEHICLES ENERGY

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:58.293
COMMISSION GETS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.996
FUNDING- WITHIN SORT OF THE

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.097
RATIONALE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:02.798
DIFFERENT ON THE HEAVY DUTY

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:04.199
SIDE OF THINGS WHERE. A LOT OF

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:07.202
CASES- IT'S INITIALLY IS

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:08.871
ADOPTING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY.

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:10.005
THEY ARE PUTTING IN THE

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:11.240
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADOPTING THE

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:12.908
VEHICLES AT THE SAME TIME AND

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.943
SO THERE'S- OF THE FUNDING WILL

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.111
BE COMING OUT ABOUT THE SAME

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.145
TIME TO THE SAME ENTITIES AND

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:19.448
SO- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:20.382
QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:21.717
CONTINUES TO MAKE SENSE TO KIND

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:22.851
OF HAVE THAT FUNDING. AND THE

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.353
PROGRAMMATIC ADMINISTRATION

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:26.188
SEPARATE BETWEEN A. R. B. AND

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:27.689
ENERGY COMMISSION- BECAUSE IT

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.458
COULD CREATE POTENTIAL. ISSUES

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:31.226
AROUND COORDINATION AND ACCESS

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:33.028
TO MINISTRY OF COSTS SO. THAT'S

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:34.029
ANOTHER ISSUE FOR THE

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.564
LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:36.098
GOING FORWARD WITH THIS

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:38.567
PROPOSAL. AND THEN FINALLY THE

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:40.135
FOURTH QUESTION WHICH HAS BEEN

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.069
RAISED A COUPLE TIMES THE

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.804
EXTENSION OF AB EIGHT CITIES

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:44.740
WHICH IS. STILL PART OF THE

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:48.210
PROPOSAL- SINCE THE- CURRENT

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:49.444
PROPOSAL THE MAYOR VISION

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.480
DOESN'T CONTINUE THE- PROPOSED

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:53.849
SECURITIZATION OF THOSE AB

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:54.683
EIGHT. AND THE FEES DON'T

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.018
SUNSET UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:57.619
FOUR- THE EXTENSION OF THOSE

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.121
FEES ISN'T REALLY NECESSARY TO

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:01.089
AN AXE. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:01.690
PACKAGE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:03.225
PROPOSING. AS OF THE

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:04.626
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO DEFER

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:06.662
ACTION ON THAT PARTICULAR PART

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:07.529
OF THE PROPOSAL JUST TO ENSURE

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:08.964
THAT HAS. SUFFICIENT TIME TO

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:11.133
WEIGH THE MERITS OF THAT IN THE

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:12.434
CONTEXT OF ONE OF ITS BROADER.

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:13.835
OVERALL TRANSPORTATION EMISSION

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:16.104
REDUCTION STRATEGY. BUT SO I

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:17.205
WILL IN MY COMMENTS THERE HAVE

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:18.440
ANSWERING QUESTIONS DON'T YOU

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:19.741
INTERPRET THIS. THE

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.543
ADMINISTRATION'S NOT HAVING

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.145
CONTINUOUS FUNDING ON THE

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:30.686
PROGRAM SORT. OF A PROPER AS WE

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:31.520
THE LEGISLATURE THAT WILL WE

01:16:31.586 --> 01:16:32.654
CAN. THE FOR. HOW WE SPEND IT

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:33.455
IS GOING TO BE SET UP BY FUTURE

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:35.991
LEDGE. LEGISLATURE THERE THERE-

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:36.658
AND THAT'S IT THAT'S A-

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:42.564
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OR IS IT NOT.

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:46.101
YEAH I MEAN I THINK- YOU KNOW

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:48.170
THERE THERE'S- ADAM WAS WITH US

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:49.438
WE TALKED ABOUT ON KIND OF THE

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:50.439
EIGHTY EIGHT THE STUFF BEFORE

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:52.407
THERE'S- THERE'S GONNA

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:53.775
RATIONALE TO KIND OF TAKE

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:55.577
EXTEND THE SEASON THE PROGRAMS

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:56.178
TO KIND OF PLAY AN IMPORTANT

01:16:56.244 --> 01:16:58.113
ROLE I THINK AND- AND DIFFERENT

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.181
KIND OF FUNNY DIFFERENT AIR

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:01.216
QUALITY PROGRAMS THERE ARE BIG

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.417
QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:04.019
THAT BEST MAKES A PROGRAM

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.722
SHOULD BE GOING FORWARD- AND SO

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:08.090
YOU KNOW THE THAT YOU KNOW IT

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:09.591
MADE VERY WELL BE THAT THE

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:10.692
LEGISLATURE SORT OF THE SITES

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.127
YES WE DO WANT SORT OF THAT-

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:14.229
THAT FUNDING STREAM TO EXTEND

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:15.731
GOING FORWARD I THINK. THE MAIN

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:18.166
ISSUE ON THAT PARTICULAR PIECE

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:19.167
OF IT IS JUST IT TURNED OUT

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:20.936
THAT THE EXTENSION I'M NOT

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:22.204
DECISION DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:24.139
NEED TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW IN

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:25.073
PARTICULAR TO KIND OF ABOUT

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.541
THIS THIS PACKAGE BUT IF THE

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:27.809
LEGISLATURE SORTS USE THAT AS A

01:17:27.876 --> 01:17:29.011
VALUABLE FUNDING STREAM GOING

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:30.746
FORWARD AND- CLEARLY THAT'S

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:32.347
KINDOF WITHIN. A WITHIN ITS

01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:33.582
PURVIEW TO IT TO EXTEND THAT

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:39.654
FUNDING AND WORK OUT EXACTLY.

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:40.222
HOW IT'S HOW IT'S BEEN GOING

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:40.956
FORWARD. WELL I THINK CHECK

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:42.024
BENNY SAID TIMING IS EVERYTHING

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:44.760
ALRIGHT. AS ME LEFT WITH THAT-

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:47.362
OKAY. SENATOR DOLLY HAS THE

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.765

ALMOST OVER ALMOST A THIRD OF

02:00:00.393 --> 02:00:03.129
OUR COAST HI AND IT SHOULD BE

02:00:03.195 --> 02:00:05.431
ADVANCING A PROACTIVE EFFORT TO

02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:06.532
PROTECT THE PARKS IN THE

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:07.700
COMMUNITIES ADJACENT TO THE

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:11.270
PARK'S FROM SEA LEVEL RISE

02:00:11.337 --> 02:00:12.171
NEST. WOULD FIND THAT. SO TOLD

02:00:12.238 --> 02:00:13.773
THOSE THOSE CLIMATE RESILIENCE

02:00:13.839 --> 02:00:14.874
INVESTMENTS DEPENDING ON HOW

02:00:14.941 --> 02:00:17.410
YOU CUT THEM- ARE WELL OVER

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.512
ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. COMPARE

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:20.780
THAT TO THE INVESTMENTS IN

02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:22.281
JANUARY AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE

02:00:22.348 --> 02:00:24.050
OF ABOUT TWO BILLION. FROM MY

02:00:24.116 --> 02:00:25.084
PERSPECTIVE THIS IS OUR

02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:27.453
GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:28.888
MAKE THIS DOWN PAYMENT IN

02:00:28.955 --> 02:00:30.089
PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND

02:00:30.156 --> 02:00:31.524
NATURAL PLACES FROM WHAT WE

02:00:31.591 --> 02:00:33.426
KNOW IS. IS HERE AND GETTING

02:00:33.492 --> 02:00:35.394
WORSE ALL OF THESE CLIMATE

02:00:35.461 --> 02:00:37.063
DRIVEN THREATS. TWO MORE

02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:38.998
PRIORITIES I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

02:00:39.065 --> 02:00:40.733
ONE IS INVESTMENTS INTO OUR

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:43.002
STATE PARK SYSTEM AND OUR FOCUS

02:00:43.069 --> 02:00:44.704
ON EXPANDING RECREATIONAL

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:46.038
ACCESS WITH AN EYE TOWARDS

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:49.075
EQUITABLE RECREATIONAL ACCESS

02:00:49.141 --> 02:00:49.675
INTO OUR STATE PARKS AND OPEN

02:00:49.742 --> 02:00:52.244
SPACES- SIX OUT OF TEN

02:00:52.311 --> 02:00:53.879
CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN PARK POOR

02:00:53.946 --> 02:00:56.215
COMMUNITIES MEANING- THEY ARE

02:00:56.282 --> 02:00:58.217
GENERALLY DEVOID OF PLACES TO

02:00:58.284 --> 02:01:00.553
BE OUTDOORS IN NATURE- FOUR OUT

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:01.854
OF TEN CALIFORNIANS HAVE NO

02:01:01.921 --> 02:01:03.589
ACCESS TO. ANY OPEN SPACE

02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:05.625
WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. WE

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:06.926
KNOW THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE

02:01:06.993 --> 02:01:08.761
THIS WELL WE'RE VERY PROUD OF

02:01:08.828 --> 02:01:10.096
THIS THE STATE PARK SYSTEM

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:11.163
WHICH IS THE BIGGEST IN THE

02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:13.332
COUNTRY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY.

02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:15.301
UNITS WITHIN OUR STATE PARKS WE

02:01:15.368 --> 02:01:17.103
KNOW THAT THAT ACCESS IS

02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:19.271
ENJOYED IN IN AN EQUITABLE WAY

02:01:19.338 --> 02:01:20.740
MEANING SOME OF US CAN ACTUALLY

02:01:20.806 --> 02:01:23.342
GO FAIRLY EASILY OTHERS CAN'T.

02:01:23.409 --> 02:01:25.511
AND SO WE ALSO KNOW THAT COLD

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:27.046
ED ARE DEMONSTRATE HOW

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:28.547
IMPORTANT THESE OUTDOOR SPACES

02:01:28.614 --> 02:01:33.085
ARE ARE FOR US BUT ALSO

02:01:33.152 --> 02:01:34.920
THEY WERE CONTEMPLATING THEIR-

02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:36.255
PERSISTING THROUGH THE STAY AT

02:01:36.322 --> 02:01:37.223
HOME ORDER AND ALL THE

02:01:37.289 --> 02:01:39.125
CHALLENGES WE HAD. I DIDN'T

02:01:39.191 --> 02:01:40.726
HAVE PLACES TO BE OUTSIDE AND

02:01:40.793 --> 02:01:42.628
COULDN'T ACCESS THESE PLACES.

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:44.463
SO WE PROPOSE A BILLION DOLLARS

02:01:44.530 --> 02:01:46.565
IN OUR STATE PARK SYSTEM AND

02:01:46.632 --> 02:01:48.567
EQUITABLE ACCESS. ARE FULLY

02:01:48.634 --> 02:01:50.369
OVER THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:01:50.436 --> 02:01:51.971
MILLION DOLLARS TO STATE PARKS

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:53.873
OR WILDLIFE OR I SHOULD SAY

02:01:53.939 --> 02:01:55.808
WILDFIRE RESTORATION PROJECTS

02:01:55.875 --> 02:01:57.410
RIGHT NOW FIVE OF OUR STATE

02:01:57.476 --> 02:01:58.811
PARKS ARE FULLY CLOSED AS A

02:01:58.878 --> 02:02:00.980
RESULT OF WILDFIRE IMPACTS AND

02:02:01.047 --> 02:02:01.847
ANOTHER NINE ARE PARTIALLY

02:02:01.914 --> 02:02:03.816
CLOSED. THIS IS GONNA HELP

02:02:03.883 --> 02:02:05.384
THOSE PARKS ABI RESTORED AND

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:07.353
REOPENED AND THEN SIGNIFICANT

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:08.521
FUNDING INTO OUR DEFERRED

02:02:08.587 --> 02:02:10.589
MAINTENANCE ACROSS OUR PARKS

02:02:10.656 --> 02:02:11.691
WHICH IS CRITICAL AND THAT'S

02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:13.826
EVERYTHING FROM RESTROOMS TO

02:02:13.893 --> 02:02:15.795
PARKING LAST A TRAIL HEADS. ARE

02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:19.198
THE. PLACES WHERE- WE CAMP. SO

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:20.833
NOT ONLY STATE PARKS IS THE

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:23.703

INVESTMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

02:04:24.190 --> 02:04:27.493
RESTORATION BUT THEY CAN ALSO-

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.562
IMPROVE RECREATIONAL ACCESS.

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:31.230
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:32.298
RECORD IN THE OUTDOORS LIKE

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:34.466
FISHING AND HUNTING- AND THEN

02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:36.068
ALSO TOSSED MARC LAND

REMOVING CARBON FROM THE

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:43.108
ATMOSPHERE. SO WE PROPOSED TWO

02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:44.109
HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:45.211
FOR A WILDLIFE CORRIDOR AND

THE CHALLENGES THAT A LOT OF

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.083
OUR FISH AND OTHER ANIMALS

02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:54.987
HAVE. TO MIGRATE- ACROSS- THEIR

02:04:55.054 --> 02:04:56.889
LIFE CYCLES I AM REMOVING

02:04:56.956 --> 02:04:59.425
BARRIERS- AND CONSTRUCTING

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:00.459
WILDLIFE FRIENDLY HIGHWAY

02:05:00.526 --> 02:05:02.995
CROSSINGS EVERYTHING FROM LARGE

02:05:03.062 --> 02:05:05.231
ANIMALS BIG GAME TOO FAST. AND

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:05.731
THEN TWO HUNDRED MILLION

02:05:05.798 --> 02:05:08.000
DOLLARS FOR HABITAT RESTORATION

02:05:08.067 --> 02:05:09.268
THE SUPPORT WETLANDS

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.970
FLOODPLAINS MULTI BENEFIT FLOOD

02:05:11.036 --> 02:05:15.174
REDUCTION PROJECTS. AGAIN WITH

02:05:15.241 --> 02:05:15.774
THAT MULTIPLE BENEFIT FOCUS.

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:16.375
I'M REALLY PROUD OF THAT THE

02:05:16.442 --> 02:05:18.177
PROPOSAL INCLUDES TARGETED

PROCESS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:26.252
THREE YEARS TO MEASURE THAT'S

02:05:26.318 --> 02:05:28.420
THE DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES

02:05:28.487 --> 02:05:29.255
VERSES THAT STATUTORY

02:05:29.321 --> 02:05:31.190
REQUIREMENTS. AND WHAT WE FIND

02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:32.992
IS A MAJOR GAP BETWEEN THE

02:05:33.058 --> 02:05:34.627
RESOURCES THE FISH AND WILDLIFE

02:05:34.693 --> 02:05:37.229
HOUSE TO DO ITS JOB. AND WHAT

02:05:37.296 --> 02:05:40.232
WE ASK IS THAT- NOW THIS FIVE

02:05:40.299 --> 02:05:41.333
PROPOSED BUDGET DOESN'T PROVIDE

02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:42.568
THE BEST SOLUTION BUT IT

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:43.969
PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT BRIDGING

02:05:44.036 --> 02:05:46.038
SOLUTION WHICH IS EIGHTY

02:05:46.105 --> 02:05:47.172
MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME

02:05:47.239 --> 02:05:49.241

RECREATIONAL LAST LIKE FISHING

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:04.390
AND HUNTING- ARE THOSE WHO WORK

02:06:04.456 --> 02:06:06.225
RECREATION AT THAT WAY. AND

02:06:06.292 --> 02:06:07.726
IMPORTANTLY TO DO SOMETHING I

NEW PROGRAMS AND THAT'S REALLY

02:11:50.702 --> 02:11:52.304
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE- WHEN

JUST ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

ABOUT WHAT THE MEASURABLE

02:12:15.294 --> 02:12:16.495

02:20:04.162 --> 02:20:06.331
IS A TWO ONE TO TWO. BUT

02:20:06.397 --> 02:20:08.600
THERE'S AMOUNTS INDIA HERE SO

02:20:08.666 --> 02:20:10.635
IT'S A TOUGH OF ONE THREE- SO

CRITICAL AND I THINK THAT IS. A

02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:17.241

02:32:13.724 --> 02:32:14.859
SEVERAL TIMES. TO REALLY

02:32:14.925 --> 02:32:16.994
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE

02:32:17.061 --> 02:32:18.529
AS WE START START TO ESTABLISH

02:32:18.596 --> 02:32:19.897
CRITERIA FOR WHAT NEEDS TO BE

02:32:19.964 --> 02:32:22.299
GOING INTO PLANNING. ON MAKING

02:32:22.366 --> 02:32:24.001
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING

02:32:24.068 --> 02:32:25.236
THE COMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS LIKE

02:32:25.302 --> 02:32:27.137
WHAT YOU TARA ALREADY MENTIONED

02:32:27.204 --> 02:32:29.440
AS FAR AS CAPACITY BUILDING. SO

02:32:29.507 --> 02:32:30.774
THAT ALL VOICES ARE HEARD AND

02:32:30.841 --> 02:32:32.076
THAT PLANNING PROCESS TO MAKE

02:32:32.142 --> 02:32:33.544
SURE THAT WE CAN SAFELY

02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:35.946
EVACUATE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF

02:32:36.013 --> 02:32:36.847
THE LONG LIST OF NATURAL

02:32:36.914 --> 02:32:38.382
DISASTERS THAT ARE THAT ARE

02:32:38.449 --> 02:32:40.251
CAUSING THE EVACUATION. AND

02:32:40.317 --> 02:32:42.119
THAT WE HAVE FACILITIES THAT

02:32:42.186 --> 02:32:43.921
ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO DO

02:32:43.988 --> 02:32:45.956
SEVERAL THINGS ONE IS TO BE

02:32:46.023 --> 02:32:47.224
SAFE BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:32:47.291 --> 02:32:48.592
SIGNIFICANT DEFERRED

02:32:48.659 --> 02:32:49.860
MAINTENANCE AND HIGHER CHISEL

02:32:49.927 --> 02:32:51.362
OF THESE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE.

02:32:51.428 --> 02:32:52.696
THEY'RE SAFE WE WANT TO MAKE

02:32:52.763 --> 02:32:55.432
SURE THAT THEY HAVE. EXPANDED

02:32:55.499 --> 02:32:57.334
BATHROOM AND SHOWER CAPACITY IS

02:32:57.401 --> 02:32:58.702
THAT'S NOT NORMALLY SOMETHING

02:32:58.769 --> 02:33:00.471
THAT SHE WAS A LOT OF FOCUS ON

02:33:00.538 --> 02:33:01.872
FOR YOU KNOW THE EVENTS THAT

02:33:01.939 --> 02:33:03.674
HAPPENED ONE OTHER TIME SURE

02:33:03.741 --> 02:33:05.109
FOR PERSONAL KITCHENS. BUT HOW

02:33:05.175 --> 02:33:06.644
DO THESE FACILITIES ALSO HAVE

02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:08.212
THE BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY

02:33:08.279 --> 02:33:09.680
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN SOME

02:33:09.747 --> 02:33:11.749
EFFORTS- TO ENHANCE THAT

02:33:11.815 --> 02:33:14.818
PROCESS. AND THEN PRIORITIZING

02:33:14.885 --> 02:33:15.986
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THIS

02:33:16.053 --> 02:33:18.289
WIH LIMITED DOLLARS WITH INPUT

02:33:18.355 --> 02:33:20.090

USED FACILITIES. WHAT IS THE

02:33:24.194 --> 02:33:26.230
STATE OF THOSE FACILITIES SO

02:33:26.297 --> 02:33:28.165

YOU BELIEVE THAT THE ACTUAL

02:34:06.704 --> 02:34:08.172
INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS WOULD

02:34:08.238 --> 02:34:11.075
ROLL OUT. IN THE TWENTY ONE

02:34:11.141 --> 02:34:12.142
TWENTY TWO BUT YOU'RE NUMBER

02:34:12.209 --> 02:34:12.943
ONE I THINK THE OTHER REALLY

02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:14.778
BIG PIECE THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH

02:34:14.845 --> 02:34:16.313
EVACUATIONS WE'VE EVACUATED.

02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:17.715
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

02:34:17.781 --> 02:34:18.882

BE CANADA REAL CLUSTER- AND I

02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:41.305
THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE FOCUSING

02:34:41.372 --> 02:34:42.806
ON AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT SHOWERS

02:34:42.873 --> 02:34:43.807

WILDLIFE IMPACTS I'M I'VE HAVE

02:38:51.188 --> 02:38:53.123
LEGISLATION THAT IN ITS IN ITS

02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:55.125
MY BILLS ARE GOING TO SET THE

02:38:55.192 --> 02:38:56.260

02:38:56.326 --> 02:38:58.495
OUT. AT THE END OF THE WEEK

02:38:58.562 --> 02:39:01.164
IT'S- INTERESTING TO ME THAT WE

OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE

02:39:09.039 --> 02:39:11.241
SEEING INFLATION- BUILDING

02:39:11.308 --> 02:39:12.209
RIGHT NOW JUST BECAUSE THERE'S

02:39:12.276 --> 02:39:13.777
BEEN SO MUCH MONEY AND FUSED.

02:39:13.844 --> 02:39:16.980
NOT ONLY. IN CALIFORNIA BUT-

02:39:17.047 --> 02:39:19.549
NATIONWIDE. AND SO I'M I'M NOT

02:39:19.616 --> 02:39:20.817
GOING TO COMMENT MORE THAN THAT

02:39:20.884 --> 02:39:23.253
I JUST WANNA SAY I DO. THINK WE

02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:23.754
SHOULD BE SPENDING THESE

02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:25.555
RESOURCE ON ONE TIME PROJECTS

02:39:25.622 --> 02:39:26.490
THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED AND

02:39:26.556 --> 02:39:28.525
THEN- HITTING THOSE TARGETED

02:39:28.592 --> 02:39:30.294
AREAS THAT WE KNOW. HAVE BEEN A

02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:31.895
PROBLEM FOR SPURS FOR SOMETIME

02:39:31.962 --> 02:39:32.829
WHICH YOU HAVE ADDRESSED THE

02:39:32.896 --> 02:39:34.064
FIRE IN THE IN THE DROUGHT

02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:35.999
ISSUES AND TO GET THOSE. OF

02:39:36.066 --> 02:39:38.335
MONIES AVAILABLE- TO THE

02:39:38.402 --> 02:39:40.737
AGENCIES AND PLACES WHERE AS

02:39:40.804 --> 02:39:42.039
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY

02:39:42.105 --> 02:39:44.241
DURING THIS DROUGHT TIME- I

02:39:44.308 --> 02:39:45.609
THINK IS A- WOULD BE

02:39:45.676 --> 02:39:47.277
APPROPRIATE SO WITH THAT. I'LL

02:39:47.344 --> 02:39:48.245
SAVE A LOT OF MY COMMENTS

02:39:48.312 --> 02:39:49.446
ACTUALLY FOR WHEN WE SEE THE

02:39:49.513 --> 02:39:50.714
FINAL BUDGET WHERE WE ACTUALLY

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:52.316
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. DIG A

02:39:52.382 --> 02:39:54.384
LITTLE DEEPER- BUT THIS IS

02:39:54.451 --> 02:39:55.752
REALLY LARGE AND I THINK THAT

02:39:55.819 --> 02:39:57.287
IT IS SOMEWHAT SCARY TO ME THAT

02:39:57.354 --> 02:39:59.690
WE HAVE THIS MUCH. MOVING THIS

02:39:59.756 --> 02:40:01.625
FAST AND TO TRY TO. HAVE THE

02:40:01.692 --> 02:40:03.560
LEGISLATURE KEEP THEIR ARMS ON

02:40:03.627 --> 02:40:05.729
EVEN THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE-

02:40:05.796 --> 02:40:07.898
ADMITTED THAT THEY- YOU KNOW

02:40:07.965 --> 02:40:08.865
THEY HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

02:40:08.932 --> 02:40:09.933
TO REALLY DIG INTO THIS AND SO

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.135
I THINK. WE SHOULD MAYBE LOOK A

02:40:12.202 --> 02:40:13.904
LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION AS WE GO

02:40:13.971 --> 02:40:14.471
FORWARD AND JUST MAKE SURE

02:40:14.538 --> 02:40:16.340
