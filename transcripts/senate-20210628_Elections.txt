IT WILL NOW GO TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A LEAD OPPONENT. MISTER JOHN AT TO DO YOUR- WITH NAPA COUNTY- NOT PRESENT HERE IN THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE ASSUME HE'S ON THE PHONE LINES- MODERATOR WOULD YOU INVITE HIM TO PLEASE PROVIDE US TESTIMONY NOW. THANK YOU NOT LINE IS OPEN. SHARE GLAZER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN TUTOR NAPA COUNTY REGISTRAR OF VOTERS IN MY FORTY THIRD YEAR IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IN NAPA COUNTY AND MY TWENTY THIRD YEAR AS REGISTRAR OF VOTERS- THERE'S A BASIC PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL AND THAT IS THIS IDEA THAT GREATER TURNOUT IN LOCAL ELECTIONS WILL OCCUR IN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES. IN MY VIEW THE EXACT OPPOSITE IS TRUE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE DROP OFF FROM GOVERNOR TO THE NEXT- CONTEST ON THE BALLOT WHICH IS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WAS EIGHT POINT THREE FOUR PERCENT. IN JUNE OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY THE DROP OFF FROM PRESIDENT TO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WAS FORTY THREE POINT 7% THAT'S 35% INCREASE IN DROP OFF HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE VOTERS THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER WHO DO TURN OUT FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THEM ONLY VOTE FOR PRESIDENT. THEY DO NOT VOTE DOWN BALLOT ISSUES. AND ADDING ANY LOCAL OFFICIALS TO THE BALLOT. MAKE THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT IS ALREADY. THOSE RACES ARE FOR A REASON ON THE STATEWIDE GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY THE MAIN REASON IS TO BALANCE THE NUMBER OF CONTESTS ON THE BALLOT. SO THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WHICH IS ALREADY LONG CONFUSING AND WITH MULTIPLE BALLOTS CARDS WILL NOT GET WORSE. THE FINAL POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IS THAT THE STATEWIDE OFFICERS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ATTORNEY GENERAL ETCETERA ARE ALL ON THE GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY. AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO CARRY OUT FUNCTIONS SUCH AS THAT LIKE THE DA THE SHERIFF. AND THE COUNTY CLERK REMAIN ON THE- GUBERNATORIAL STATEWIDE PRIMARY I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I HAVE ASKED FOR A VOTE AGAINST THANK YOU MISTER TUTOR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL GO TO ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. HERE IN THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE C. NINE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES AT. THE SAME- GUIDANCE TO THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TESTIFYING OPPOSITION TO POLICE JUST NOW PROVIDE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION IN YOUR POSITION IN OPPOSITION MODERATOR WOULD YOU INVITE THOSE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. TO SEVEN FIVE NINE. TO SO INDICATE. THANK YOU TO SHARE YOUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL MANY PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. AGAIN THAT'S ONE AND THEN ZERO. WE'LL GO FIRST TO LINE TWENTY TWO TWO TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER NUMBER KAREN LAYING ON THE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNTY TREASURER AND TAX COLLECTOR. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL IN FRANCE BUT IT SOUNDS ABOUT THE COMMISSION TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT CERTAINLY OF THE COUNTY. YEAH ATTACK OF THE BILL ON COUNTY TREASURE'S AND WITH THAT I THINK THAT WOULD WITH OUR OPPOSITION. WITH WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE LINE. TWENTY NINE. HELLO RIGHT ROCKER REPRESENTED THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS WERE OPPOSED IN OUR LETTERS FORTHCOMING. WE HAVE LINE THIRTY FIVE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY CELLS L. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THERE FOR NO FURTHER LINES IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MODERATE WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I'LL GO FIRST IF THAT'S OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL I KNOW YOUR INTENTIONS ARE GOOD AND I APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY WE'VE HAD TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS- PRIOR TO WORK- HEARING TODAY- FOR ME AT LEAST IF YOUR BILL WAS TO GIVE OPTIONS TO THE LOCALS. IN TERMS OF- WHERE THEY COULD CHOOSE TO PUT THEIR ALEXION'S IDEA ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT. BUT BECAUSE IT'S A MANDATE- ON ON EVERY COUNTY- I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BILL LITTLE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. I DID FIND- SOMEONE KNOW WHERE THE POINT THAT WAS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS- THAT NOT ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT. OF THESE COUNTY ALL ELECTIONS ARE SETTLED IN THE PRIMARY IN THE PRIMARY. SO WHAT YOUR BILL AT THAT- CARRIED FORWARD WOULD REALLY MEAN IS THAT EFFECT ABOUT FIVE PERCENT- THAT WOULDHAVE THAT MATTERS THAT MOVING TO THE NOVEMBER ELECTION VERSES THAT. THAT THE PRIMARY ELECTION AND A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT. THE GOALS FOR THE BILL IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION- PRETTY PRETTY MODEST- CHANGES THAT I CAN SEE AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE PRIMARY- TURNOUT- I WOULD ALSO. NOTE THAT. THERE ARE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH- WE HEARD THE THIRD TO THE REGISTRAR FROM THE COUNTY. OF NAFTA TALK ABOUT THE DROP OFF RATE- IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT IN PRESIDENTIAL RACES. YET THE COST OF RUNNING IN A PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS DRAMATICALLY HIGHER- BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL AT LEAST FOR A GREATER PARTICIPATION WHICH ON% ONE HAND IS A GOOD THING. ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S BALANCED OUT BY SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GET THEIR MESSAGES OUT. AT NOT JUST IN TERMS OF A COST. PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM THE IS GETTING THE ATTENTION OF THE VOTERS TO THAT CONTEST ITSELF. AS WE KNOW IN THESE PRESIDENTIAL RACES IT'S KINDA SUCKS THE OXYGEN. OUT OF THE ROOM FOR A LOT OF THAT. REPORTING THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE EITHER ONLINE OR BROADCAST MEDIA FOR SOME OF THE OTHER RACES THAT WE ARE- FOLLOWING. SO WITH THAT I- WITH ALL RESPECT I'M NOT GOING TO JOINING YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL TODAY I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY HAVE THE VOTES TO MOVE THE BILL FURTHER. FORWARD IN ANY CASE AND THAT'S THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE BUT I DID WANT TO RAISE THOSE ISSUES- WITH YOU IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESSING YOU CAN'T WE CAN GO TO OTHER COLLEAGUES FOR COMMENTS. YEAH I'D AM WELL THANK YOU FOR RAISING THOSE ISSUES AND I DID WANT TO ADDRESS THAT THE OP THE OPPOSITION. THE TWO LATER CALLS- WERE SIMILAR TO THEM THE MAIN UPON IT AND ALL DRESSED THAT HIS HIS THREE ISSUES AS WELL. AS AS YOU KNOW THE TAX COLLECTORS AND THE OTHER COUNTY OFFICES OTHER THAN SHERIFF AND DA. THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO BE PART OF THE BILL SO I THINK THOSE. ARE A BIT MOVE ON ON THE ISSUE AS FAR AS HAVING A DROP OFF. IN THE PRESIDENTIAL A CERTAINLY THERE IS BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT EVEN THE DROP OFF. WITH THE DROP OFF IS STILL FAR GREATER POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND HAVING IT. IN THE GUBERNATORIAL YEAR AND THEN AS FAR AS- THE PRIMARY VERSES THE GENERAL THAT WOULD BE THE SAME WAY WHETHER IT'S IN. A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OR A- FOR I DO MAJORITY OVER SAYS THE PRIMARY. THERE'S ONLY TWO CANDIDATES GOING ON. ONTO THE GENERAL SO I DO THINK THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED- SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. AND THEN- A- THE MAIN CONCERNS WE HEARD THERE THEY WILL BE ADDRESSED THE NEXT COMMITTEE ONLY ONLY FOCUSING ON. THE TOP TWO ISSUES OF THE SHERIFF AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. VERY GOOD OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SENATOR NEWMAN- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I DO APPRECIATE THE CHEERS- COMMENTS AND CONCERNS IT. WAS RECORDED WHEN I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR. YOUR WILLINGNESS. TO BE THROUGH A THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE ABOUT THIS- AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED. THE TWO POSITIONS AT ISSUE HERE DA AND SHERIFF- ARE IMPORTANT I THINK IN THE LAST YEAR. WE HAVE SEEN. I JUST HOW IMPORTANT THESE TO PUBLIC SAFETY POSITIONS. ARE AND TO YOUR POINT YOUR GOAL- A MORE REPRESENTATIVE MORE DIVERSE ELECTORATE- IS CLEARLY A GOOD THING WHEN IT COMES TO DETERMINE WHO WILL STE WHO WILL SERVE IN THOSE POSITIONS- SO WITH THAT- BUT I. YOU KNOW GAD TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT RESPECT THE SBA L. AS A CO AUTHOR AS IT MOVES THROUGH- AND HAVE BEEN MOVED THE BILL IN THE TIMES PROGRAM. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS- C. NINE A CELL NUMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT DEBATE- THAT PRECIADO THE CONSIDERATION ASKREDDIT. THREAD I RECOGNIZE THE MOTION FOR THE SENATOR NEWMAN- TO- DO PATHS- THIS BILL THROUGH- THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE. AND FINANCE. WITH THAT AS THE CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AB SEVEN FIVE NINE MO IS TO. THE FIRST RE. TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. GLAZER NOPE GLAZER NO NIELSEN. HERTZBERG HERTZBERG AYE LIVE A LIFE LEYVA HI NEWMAN AYE NEWMAN I. REFLECT THAT YOUR BILL HAS THREE VOTES WERE GONNA LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ALL RIGHT THAT BRINGS US TO THE LAST- IT MATTER ON OUR AGENDA- ITEM NUMBER FIVE S. C. A. ONE BY SENATOR HERTZBERG WELCOME. AND YOU CAN PRESENT IN YOUR DESK IF YOU LIKE. THANK. GEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR. I HAVE BEEN A- DILIGENT STUDENT OF THE DIRECT DEMOCRACY THIS YEAR'S FOR MANY DECADES. YOU WILL FIND THIS BOOK ON MY DESK CALL CALIFORNIA ISSUES IN REFERENDUMS NINETEEN TWELVE TO NINETEEN NINETY BUT THE PAT BROWN INSTITUTE. AND DAVID BRODER WHO I INTERVIEWED WITH ON DEMOCRACY DERAILED. INITIATIVE CAMPAIGNS AND WHEN I SERVED IN MY LAST JOB I HAD A COMMISSION ON INITIATIVE REFORM. AND ALSO WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE- AT THE COUPLE OF YOUR EFFORT THAT WE PUT TOGETHER WITH RON GEORGE SHE WITH THE- COMMON CAUSE GROUP AND A HOST OF OTHERS- TO REFORM INITIATIVES. ALL OF WHICH ARE INFORMED BY THE UNDER THE BANNER OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY WHICH CAME UNDER HIRAM JOHNSON. WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY DIRECT DEMOCRACY CAME AT A TIME WHEN THE RAILROADS. AT THE END INAPPROPRIATE INFLUENCE ON THIS PLACE. AND BOND THERE WAS EXTRAORDINARY CORRUPTION AND THIS WAS A WAY TO GIVE POWER TO THE PEOPLE. POWER TO THE PEOPLE TO OVERTURN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES. WOULD YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE SEEN IT IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT BY OUTSIDE INTEREST GROUPS WE'VE SEEN IT IN THE REFERENDUM PROCESS. SIMILAR KIND OF A THING HAPPENING IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS PAT BROWN INSTITUTE BOOK IT'LL SHOW YOU THAT JUST VISTA HANDFUL WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INITIATIVES FOR EXAMPLE THE REFERENCED APPROPRIATELY IN YOUR ANALYSIS. VERY FEW IN THE EARLY YEARS AND THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE NINETY NINE IT WAS FORTY FOUR AT OVER FORTY S. SIXTY ONE. TO pNEXT NUMBER OF SIXTY ONE OF THE NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A MOVEMENT AFOOT. BY OUTSIDE INTEREST GROUPS AS WE HAVE MORE TELEVISION MORE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE PROCESS TO DRAMATICALLY UP USE THIS TOOL THAT WAS INITIALLY INTENDED TO GIVE POWER TO THE PEOPLE AND NOW IT'S EXCEPT THE APT IMPACT IS EXACTLY OPPOSITE AND REFERENDUMS. ARE PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME. BECAUSE THE IN THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IN THIS MEASURE. IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKES AN ACTION. SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR PASSED BY BOTH HOUSES. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN INTEREST GROUP COMES ALONG AND SAYS WE DON'T LIKE THE OUTCOME WE'RE GOING TO WRITE A CHECK AND CHANGE THE GAME. WE SEE IT NOW COMING UP ON THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO BALLOT WITH TOBACCO. THEY'RE SEEKING TO REFERENDUM CENTRE HILLS MEASURE SB SEVEN NINETY THREE. THEY'VE ALREADY RAISED TWENTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION TEN MILLION DOLLARS A LOAN FROM RJ REYNOLDS. IS THAT THE WAY TO GOVERN. IT YOU START WITH THE INDIAN GAMING SOME YEARS AGO I WAS INVOLVED IN THAT ONE IS PRIVATE LAWYER WE SEEDED IT WITH RESPECT TO PODERES AND DALY OWNS IN LARGE MEASURE ON. IN AND PROP SIXTY SEVEN IN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CORRECT HERE. CERTAINLY BURKE THE REFERENDUM IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT WHICH BASICALLY SAYS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MECHANISM TO WILL BE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OVERTURN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES A FAIR AND APPROPRIATE POWER BUT IT HAS TO BE EXERCISED IN A MANNER. THAT IS FAIR AND WHAT'S HAPPENED AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CORRECT IN THIS MEASURE ARE TOO THANKS. IT'S CONFUSING BECAUSE WHEN SOME VOTER COMES ALONG AND VOTES FOR YES OR NO ON THE BALLOT SUPPORT TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT THE VOTING YES OR NO ON ALL THE INITIATIVES AND THEN THEY HAVE A FLIPPED. RESPONSIBLE YES MEANS WHAT A NO MEANS WITH RESPECT TO A REFERENDUM IT'S QUITE CONFUSING SO CONFUSING THAT I GOT CALLS AND STREAM IMPORTANT ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO TOLD ME THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD VOTED ON A MEASURE ONE WAY THE NAY VOTE ANOTHER BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU ESTIMATE I WOULDN'T MATTER. SECOND UNDER THE CONSTITUTION THE WAY THE ORDERING HAPPENS IS THAT REFERENDUMS AT THE BOTTOM WOULD YOU WE CLEARLY KNOW IN THIS LAST ELECTION OVER A MILLION PEOPLE WHO VOTED THE TOP OF THE BALLOT. DROPPED OFF BECAUSE VOTER FATIGUE AND INVOLVED THE BOTTOM OF THE BALLOT. BUT IF EVERY OTHER CON. IT'S PUT IN ORDER OF QUALIFICATION. SO YOU KNOW HAVE THEM IF YOU DON'T% HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR IN THE L. DULY ELECTED IN THE ENDEAVOR TO WHO ARE BEING ELECTED AND THEN YOU HAVE A PROCESS THAT IS COMPLETELY RIGGED IN THE SENSE OF BOTH CONFUSION. AND VOTER FATIGUE AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO CHANGE THAT PROCESS TO PUT IN A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD NO ONE'S TAKING AWAY THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE THE REFERENDA SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO DO ESPECIALLY NOW WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE THESE REFERENDUMS COMING ALONG A TO OVERTURN WITH THE LEGISLATURE DOZEN I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S BECAUSE THE YOU KNOW. THERE'S THE LEGISLATURE IS COULD IS MORE CONTROLLED BY ONE PARTY VERSUS ANOTHER AND THAT HAPPENS. AND SO. BUT THAT'S A REFLECTION OF THE PEOPLE THAT THE REDISTRICTING IS DONE IN THE DISTRICTS ARE CHOSEN. NOT BY SOME GERRYMANDERING PROCESS BUT BY A COMPLETELY NONPARTISAN FAIR PROCESS AND JUST REFLECTS WHO WE ARE AS A STATE WE CAN LIKE IT OR NOT LIKE IT. BUT IT REFLECTS WHO WE ARE AS A STATE. SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS RIGGED. IN THE IN IN THAT IT IT IS TOTALLY. AGAINST AT THE FAIR APPROACH IT CREATES A PROCESS. WHERE A YES AND EVERY OTHER INITIATIVE YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE LIST YOU GET TO THE END AND IT FLIPS. YOU CAN'T LOOK AT IT OUT OF CONTEXT NOW. JUST LATE OPPOSITION BY THE CALCHAMBER SAYS. IT CITES A CASE CALLED STRAUSS FOR HIS HORTON. WELL WHEN BOB HERTZBERG NAY THEY GIVE THIS TO ME AT THE LAST MINUTE I OF COURSE READ THE CASE. BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT SAYS IS IT SUPPORTING THEIR POSITION. AND BASICALLY THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS DOESN'T CONSTITUTE A REVISION. BUT THAT THIS CONSTITUTES A- A FAR REACHING CHANGE THE NATURE OF OUR BASIC GOVERNMENT PLAN. WE LOOK AT THAT CASE AND THAT CASE DEALT WITH PROPOSITION. EIGHT IN IN IN SAME SEX MARRIAGES. AND WHAT THE COURT SAYS IN THAT IS SPECIFICALLY A CHANGE IN THE COST IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. IS REVISION ONLY IF IT INVOLVES A CHANGE THAT IS SUCH FAR REACHING SCOPE. THAT IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE RELATION OF GOVERNMENT IN THIS CASE VESTS ALL JUDICIAL POWER IN THAT CASE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THAT IS NOT HAPPENING HERE AND TO ME YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR IN TERMS OF WHOEVER WROTE THAT LETTER. TO BE ABLE TO CHEN WILL MAYBE THE LAST GIVEN THEIR OPPOSITION TO TRY TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT BY THROWING A CASE THAT'S ALREADY OUT TO. WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME BUT RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THE DETAILS OF THE CASE. YOUR ANALYSIS CITES A CASE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH. AN APPROPRIATE WITH RESPECT TO. THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE WITH THE IS THIS SHOULD BE A CONSTITUTIONAL AS OPPOSED TO THE STATUTORY APPROACH. TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. YES YES AND SO. I JUST I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING. HOW CRITICAL IT IS.AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WOULD HAVE CA DOES IS JUST SAY. WITH RESPECT. THE REFERENDUM PROCESS. LET'S JUST MAKE IT FAIR SO YES IS A YES AND NO IS A NO CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE OTHER VOTES THAT WE ASK VOTERS. AND TO. PUT IN THE ORDER. OF HOW THEY QUALIFY JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE RATHER THAN PUTTING. A REFERENDUM WHICH IS AGAIN THIS IS NOT SOME PIE IN THE SKY I THINK IT'S BEEN VETTED TO THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE. BEEN SIGNED BY GOVERNOR. AND PUTTING AT THE END F THE BALLOT WHERE YOU HAVE VOTER FATIGUE. THAT HAS A CHILLING EFFECT A WEAPONIZING A FACT I WOULD ARGUE. AGAINST THE POWER OF THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT TO ACT SO YOU WANT A FAIR PROCESS. AND WITH THAT I'D ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG AND I HAVE A WITNESS. I JUST ANY OF THE LEAD WITH AS MUCH EITHER ANDREW MUSE FISHER FROM THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS CORRECT MODERATOR WOULD YOU INVITE MISTER. MUSICIAN TO PROVIDE IS TESTAMENT TO REMIND. CANNON AND OTHERS THAT WE PROVIDE TWO MINUTES- EACH. FIVE ON LEAD WITNESS TESTIMONY. HI GOOD MORNING AGAIN THAT THE INTERNET FOR SURE WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. HE IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE A. ONE. WE BELIEVE THAT HAVING A CLEAR STATEMENT OF A YES VOTE IN FAVOR OF IRAQ RENDON COUNTY. SHINNING NO VOTE AGAINST BACKGROUND OF TORTURE AND THAT SHE WOULD GO A LONG WAY. FOR EACH. THE LEGAL EDUCATE EMPOWER PEOPLE TO VOTE WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALLOW. INTERNET BILLING INFORMATION ISN'T ACCEPTABLE LANGUAGE AND A CRITICAL PART OF THE ENTERPRISE. TO THAT END WE PUBLISH THE EVENING ORDER GUIDE EVERY I CALL. IN IT WE OFFER CLEAR UNBIASED ABOUT. IT BUT FOR. THE RECORD AND THAT WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING A CALL OUT BOXES YES BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT DOESN'T. REGULATE PROPOSITIONS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE KERR GREEN COUNTER TO THAT VOTERS HUNTINGTON BEACH AND NOT AVAILABLE VOTING OVERTURN OR PRESERVE A LOT. WE GET QUITE AT TO WHY AN ORGANIZATION WITH THE PORT OF THE LEGISLATION HEY. AND THEN ERICA YES SO ON THE RECORD AND I TOLD. HER NOT. THE VOTERS MONTH AND ABOUT THE VOTE THE PUBLIC. AFTER ALL WHILE PROPONENTS ABOUT WHAT ABOUT NOW. ANOTHER ASSEMBLY NOTED LENGTHS. RIGHT GAME ONE ONE OUR JOB EDUCATING VOTERS MY EASIER AND INCLUDING THE PLAN MEETING OTHER YOUNG OR NO. SHE WE'RE ALSO VERY MUCH FAVOR OF OFFICE TO WORKING A BY MY. BOB BY ELECTION UP ABOUT ABOUT IT OUR COPPER BOOK BUT- POLICE REPORT SB ONE HOW OTHERS ON I MAKING FOR. WE THANK HERTZBERG LEADERSHIP AND WE ARE I THOUGHT THANK YOU THEY YOU VERY MUCH GOING TO GO AND THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE TO SEE IF THERE'S A OTHER WITNESSES FAVOR. C. NINE WILL GO TO THE LINE THAT MATER YOU CAN ASK THOSE WITH TO TEST IN SUPPORT OF A CA ONE- TO BE PER. TO DO SO AND REMIND THEM THAT WILL JUST TAKE THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION IN EDUCATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE AT THIS TIME ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO PLEASE. FIFTY THREE. I SHOW NO PHONE LINES IN Q. FOUR SUPPORT OKAY VERY GOOD MODERATOR THANK YOU WERE MOVED TO OPPOSITION TO SCA ONE I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LEAD WITNESS IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THAT CHAMBER IN OUR- IN OUR MEETING ROOM HERE I MISSED THAT MUHAMMAD WELCOME TO THE CHAMBER YOU HAVE A FEW MINUTES AND PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOUR HONOR THANK YOU TERM MEMBERS OF ANY TWELVE MOM TO THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AT CA ONE- SCA ONE IN ADDITION TO ITS- ITS OWN CHANGES BRINGS A CHANGE THE ELECTION CODE FOUND IN SB FOUR FORTY THREE. WHICH IS CONTINGENT ON SCA ONE PASSING THIS MAY APPEAR AS A TECHNICAL CHANGE THE STATURE BUT THE REASONING BEHIND THE SUGGESTION IS UNSETTLING BECAUSE IN THIS BILL IT TENDS TO SUGGEST DEVOTED TO ONE THING OVER ANOTHER- SB FOUR FORTY THREE THREATS IS ONE PASSAGE WOULD CHANGE THE LANGUAGE ON BALLOTS TO REMOVE THE WORD REJECTED OR ADOPTED AND LEAVE THE VOTERS THE CHOICE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD MERELY REJECT ITEMS THE WORD REJECTED COMES WITH A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION AND LEAVING IT ON THE PAGE ALONG WITHOUT A BOUNCING TERM LIKE ADOPTED CREATES AN IMPLIED SUGGESTION BY THE STATE. VISUALLY THE TERM REJECTED ON THE PAGE ALONE LEAVES A MUCH STRONGER NEGATIVE CONNOTATION IN THE MIND OF A VOTER THAT CAN DISCOURAGE VOTERS FROM ACTING BEFORE REMOVING BOTH CHOICES FROM THE EYES OF THE VOTER IT SHOULD BE STUDY TO DETERMINE HOW THIS AFFECTS A PERSON'S. WILLINGNESS TO VOTE. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. SUCH A CHANGE TO THE WAY VOTERS. OP A LITTLE ON THE- TOWARD OUR OPTIONS NOT READ- THE ULTIMATE POINT OF FAIRNESS ON OUR ELECTIONS. SB FORTY THREE. HOWEVER I SUGGEST THAT. REQUIRES THAT AS A ONE GAME PASSAGE FIRST. SO IN ADDITION TO GIVING OPERATIVE WIFE HAS BEFORE FORTY THREE. SB ONE WILL REQUIRE THE ADDITION OF NEW LEGALISTIC DESCRIPTIONS TO THE BALLOT WHICH IN ADDITION TO ALL OTHER INFORMATION PRINTED. STATES THAT A YES VOTE. IS IN FAVOR OF THE REFERENDUM AND REJECTS THE STATUTE OR PART OF THE STATUTES SUBJECT TO THE REFERENDUM IN A NO VOTE. IS AGAINST THE REFERENDUM. AND APPROVED THE STATURE PART OF STATUTES SUBJECT TO THE REFERENDUM. THIS IS. UNUSUAL BECAUSE A REFERENDUM BY ITS NATURE CALLS. FOR THE REJECTION OF A STATUTE OR PART OF THE STATURE. THE RISK IS GREATER WHEN LOOKING AT THE WAY IN WHICH LANGUAGES PHRASE FOR EXAMPLE. EXPLANATIONS REQUIRED BY A CA ONE. WILL JUXTAPOSE THE WORD YES WITH THE DEFINITION DESCRIBING REJECTION. AND WE'RE NOW WITH LANGUAGE APPROVAL. HOWEVER THESE FOREGOING REASONS. AND OTHERS AS NOTED IN OUR LETTER WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO WHEN I SEE ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIFIED TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE AT ONE THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE. WHICH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. THE NINE WILL GO TO THE PHONE. MY AT. THAT ANYBODY THANK YOU THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION I REMIND THEM THAT IN THIS POINT IN THE HEARING WILL ONLY TAKE THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION. AND THEIR OPPOSITION TO SCA ONE. THANK YOU TO SHARE YOUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ME PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE. AGAIN THAT'S ONE OF THE BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU THERE ARE NO LINES IN Q. RIGHT WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THAT ARE IN THE- THE YES THANK YOU MISTER IN THE THROUGH THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY A QUESTION FOR MR MOHAMMED- JANET SO I'M INTRIGUED. BY THE POINT YOU MADE WITH RESPECT TO LANGUAGE- IN THE ELIMINATION OF THE WORD- ADOPTED. SURE YOU SURE YOU ARGUE THAT IT SHOULD BE STUDY IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND TELLING US HOW HOW HOW MIGHT YOU STUDY THAT- SHORT OF ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THE- PROVISION IS PROPOSED. YES YOUR HONOR IF I MAY SO- WITH REGARD TO STUDYING THE LANGUAGE- THERE THERE IS ACTUALLY A PROCESS WHEREBY BALLOTS ARE ARE STUDIED FOR FORM- FOR THE GRAPHIC DESIGN FOR THE CONTENT IN THE LANGUAGE. THESE TYPES OF CHANGES TYPICALLY WOULD BE AB TESTED RIGHT AGAINST ONE ANOTHER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A TENDENCY FOR VOTERS. TO HAVE THEIR OPINIONS ADJUSTED WILL BE SUGGESTED OR IMPLIED ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER BASED ON THE LANGUAGE ON PAGE. PRECIADO IT YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT SHORT I. I'VE- BECOME SOMETHING OF A STUDENT OF- THE WORK OF HIRAM JOHNSON IN THE REST OF THE GUYS WHO FORMS- AND I WANT TO SAY. SPECIFICALLY TO THE BILL LIKE I AGREE WITH CENTER HERTZBERG A YOU KNOW CERTAINLY- THE WORLD HAS CHANGED A GREAT DEAL SINCE NINETEEN TWELVE- PARTICULAR THE POLITICAL WORLD- AND THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY AND SIGNATURE GATHERING WITHIN THAT WORLD- I THINK THIS IS A VERY REASONABLE AND COMMONSENSE. APPROACH BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE LANGUAGE BUT ALSO TO PUT TO. RANGING REFERENDA TO THE TOP OF THE BALLOT IF SOMETHING'S IMPORTANT FOR VOTERS TO CONSIDER. A LET'S HAVE AS MANY VOTERS AS POSSIBLE PARTICIPATE- AND LET'S HAVE THEM DO SO INTELLIGENTLY AND WON'T FOR PATIENTS SO WITH THAT- WHEN THE TIME TO PROBABLY LOOK TO MOVE THE BILL. I'VE BEEN THINKING THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN. AT CENTER HERTZBERG AYE UP HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I SUPPORTED US BEFORE FOR THREE EARLIER I THINK THE GOALS. ARE LAUDATORY AND I THINK ARE ACCOMPLISHED BY WHAT YOU WOULD PUT BEFORE US AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. LIKE SENATOR HERTZBERG CLOSE. THANK YEAH I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND TO THE LATE OPPOSITION BY THE CHAMBER AND I YOU KNOW I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BE REAL TOUGH ON THIS- BUT I JUST THINK IT'S AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO. DETERMINE WHAT THE FOREGOING REASONS AREN'T WITH THE FOREGOING REASONS AREN'T I'M CERTAIN IF I HAD COME UP WITH- THE RIVER AT THE WAY TO MODIFY THIS IN A IN A WAY THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THE REASONS THEY SUGGESTED THEY WOULD STILL OPPOSE THAT HAPPENS A LOT IN THIS BUSINESS WHERE PEOPLE GIVE YOU A SERIES OF RACES BUT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO COME ALONG. AND THE REASON OR NOT IS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING THIS ARE THEIR MEMBERSHIP I DON'T BEGRUDGE THAT THEY SHOULD ARGUE FOR THE MEMBERSHIP I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THOSE INTEREST GROUPS SHOULD CREATE THIS WEAPONIZING ON LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND I THINK THE POINT THAT WAS MADE- I WHO HAS A QUESTION BUT IT'S REALLY IS COUNTERINTUITIVE IF YOU'RE GOING ON ON THE BALLOT. MAKING A DECISION AND ALL THE CITY GOT A FLIP YOUR REASONING THE NEW TO KNOW WHAT THERE'S A REFERENDUM AND INITIATIVE IS IT'S HARD FOR FOLKS TO DO THIS STUFF YOU KNOW ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS IN ALL THE POLLING THAT I'VE DONE IN ALL THE DISCUSSION GROUPS THAT IVE HAD. SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE ONE HAND YOU SURE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE ON THE ONE HAND THEY'RE SO FRUSTRATED WITH LIKE WHY CAN'T YOU PEOPLE OF THE LEGISLATURE SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS WHY DO THESE HAVE TO COME ON THE BALLOT WHY DO I HAVE TO DETERMINE THESE QUESTIONS RIGHT SOME OF MY BOND ISSUES AND SOME WERE CONSTITUTIONAL IN NATURE. AND THAT'S THE WAY WE'VE WRITTEN THE LAW BUT THEY WANT US TO SOLVE IT AT THE SAME TIME THEY ALSO WANT TO RESERVE THE POWER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHECK ON US WHICH IS ALSO APPROPRIATE BUT THAT POWER SHOULD BE RESERVED IN A MANNER THAT'S FAIR STRAIGHTFORWARD EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE FOR ALL FOLKS NOT COUNTERINTUITIVE AND NOT BEING WEAPONIZED AND WE SHIP EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. TO REINVIGORATE THE ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM. AND WISDOM OF HIRAM JOHNSON. ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU CENTER HEARD AMERICA THE NOT. SENT NEWMAN TO- MOVE THIS BILL FOR.
