00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:11.662
THE GUARANTEE.

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:13.297
AS A PAYMENT TOWARD SOME PRIOR

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:14.531
FISCAL YEAR IS.

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:16.233
AND THAT SIGNIFICANT BOTH

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.534
BECAUSE IT AVOID THIS --

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:18.969
MID YEAR CUTS AND PAYMENT

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:20.638
DEFERRALS SO IT'S UP MORE

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:22.139
STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY FOR

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.073
SCHOOLS.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.842
IT ALSO KEEPS THAT FUNDING FROM

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:26.644
BECOMING PART OF THE BASIS FOR

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.311
CALCULATING NEXT YEAR'S

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:28.679
GUARANTEE SO IT GIVES YOU A

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:32.449
LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:33.584
SUBSEQUENT BUDGETS.

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:35.185
I TURNING TO PAGE TWO OF OUR

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:36.287
HAND OUT AS YOU FOR THE

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:36.854
MINISTRATION SAY --

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:37.655
THE GUARANTEE UNDER THE

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.089
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD GROW

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:42.293
THREE POINT 6% IN.

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:42.927
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:44.228
YOU PROBABLY I RECOGNIZE THAT AS

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.230
BEING A BIT LOWER THAN WHAT.

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:47.064
WE'VE SEEN IN SOME PREVIOUS YEAR

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:48.933
IS A LOT OF THAT PREVIOUS GROWTH

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:50.501
HAD TO DO WITH THIS

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:52.369
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR

00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:53.604
THE STATE TO A STORY SCHOOL

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:56.273
FUNDING FOR INCREASES IT DIDN'T

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:56.840
PROVIDE DURING THE RECESSION

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:57.808
YEARS.

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.510
AND THE STATE AS OF LAST YEAR

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:01.145
HAS NO FINISHED MAKING THOSE

00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:03.213
RESTORATION PAYMENTS AND SO

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.082
SCHOOL FUNDING IS LIKELY TO GROW.

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:06.383
MORE SLOWLY MOVING FORWARD.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.852
EVEN IF WE HAVE A VERY STRONG

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.387
ECONOMY LIKE THE ONE RIGHT NOW.

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:13.724
I THINK THIS YEAR'S BUDGET GIVES

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:16.160
YOU A GOOD FLAVOR OF WHAT THAT.

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:16.760
KIND OF NEW GROWTH WILL LOOK

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:17.361
LIKE I WITH GROWTH MORE IN THE

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.530
RANGE OF 324% COMPARED WITH SIX

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:23.801
OR 7% IN PREVIOUS YEARS.

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:25.035
THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO WAS

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:26.370
UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF LOCAL

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:27.705
PROPERTY TAX REVENUE I WE CAN

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.039
COVER THAT IN MORE DETAIL IF

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:30.441
YOU'RE INTERESTED --

00:43:30.507 --> 00:43:31.842
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:32.743
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.011
ESTIMATES OF PROPERTY TAX

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:35.946
REVENUE I REASONABLE ACROSS THE

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:38.115
ENTIRE THREE YEAR BUDGET PERIOD

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:44.188
OF THEIR OUR ESTIMATES --

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:45.322
THE IN BELOW ARE IS STILL QUITE

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:47.725
CLOSE MUCH CLOSER EVEN THAN IN

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:50.027
SOME PREVIOUS YEARS.

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:51.362
TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF THIS IS

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:53.397
LARGELY JUST A RECAP OF ALL OF

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:54.631
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSITION

00:43:54.698 --> 00:43:55.733
NINETY EIGHT PROPOSALS IN THIS

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:56.834
YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.202
I WON'T COVER ANY OF THESE RIGHT

00:43:58.268 --> 00:44:00.204
NOW BECAUSE I THINK OF YOU ALL

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.705
OF THEM AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS.

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:02.973
WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:03.907
STRIKING FEATURE OF THE

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.709
GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PACKAGE IS

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:07.244
JUST HOW MUCH OF THE NEW

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.345
SPENDING IS DEDICATED TO

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:09.513
COVERING THE COST OF LIVING

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.714
ADJUSTMENT --

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:12.216
WE ESTIMATE THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:44:12.282 --> 00:44:13.817
HAS TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:14.918
NET NEW SPENDING.

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:16.487
ACROSS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY

00:44:16.553 --> 00:44:19.056
COLLEGES AND OF THAT AMOUNT TWO

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:20.224
AND A HALF BILLION IS DEDICATED

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.191
TO COVERING A THREE AND A HALF

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.493
HALF PERCENT COST OF LIVING

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:23.961
ADJUSTMENT.

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:24.828
SO THAT REALLY MAKES THIS FOR A

00:44:24.895 --> 00:44:27.498
OF A STRAIGHT FORWARD BUDGET.

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:28.732
TEN WITH MUCH FEWER NEW

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:31.301
PROPOSALS THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:33.103
SOME PRIOR YEARS.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.304
TURNING TO PAGE FOR I THINK A

00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:36.140
LITTLE HISTORICAL REVIEW MIGHT

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:37.541
HELP BUT THE BUDGET IN CONTEXT.

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:38.909
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:40.944
SCHOOL FUNDING WOULD BE TWELVE

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:41.545
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:43.914
PER PUPIL IN.

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:44.548
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AN

00:44:44.615 --> 00:44:46.116
INCREASE OF THREE POINT 8% OVER

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:48.152
THE REVISED TWO THOUSAND

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:49.820
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVEL.

00:44:49.887 --> 00:44:51.221
DUE IN LARGE PART TO A VERY LONG

00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:53.290
ECONOMIC EXPANSION THIS IS THE

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.324
HIGHEST LEVEL OF FUNDING THE

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:55.859
STATE HAS EVER PROVIDED.

00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:57.628
ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION A SCHOOL

00:44:57.694 --> 00:44:59.396
FUNDING IS FIVE HUNDRED PER

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:01.598
STUDENT ABOVE THE PREVIOUS PEAK

00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:03.100
IN.

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:03.700
TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE

00:45:03.767 --> 00:45:05.636
AND ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED ABOVE

00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:07.504
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT A

00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:09.606
PREVIOUS SESSION LEVEL.

00:45:09.673 --> 00:45:10.974
A TURNING TO PAGE FIVE WE

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.476
SOMETIMES LOOK BEYOND OUR OWN

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:14.111
BORDERS TO SEE HOW CALIFORNIA

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:16.580
EDUCATION SPENDING COMPARES WITH

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:16.914
OTHER STATES.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.415
THIS IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:45:18.482 --> 00:45:19.817
DIFFICULT COMPARISON BECAUSE

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:20.751
YOU'RE.

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:22.252
LOOKING AT NOT JUST VERY

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:25.055
DECISIONS BUT ALSO THE DECISION

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:26.390
STATE YOUR IS AFFECTING THOSE

00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:27.424
RANKINGS.

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:28.392
ARE THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:30.727
SOURCE FOR SPENDING COMPARISONS

00:45:30.794 --> 00:45:32.229
COMES FROM THE US CENSUS BUREAU.

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:33.664
THE MAIN DRAWBACK OF THEIR DATA

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.065
IS THAT IT TENDS TO LAKE A

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:36.733
COUPLE YEARS AND SO ANY TIME

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.835
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RANKINGS

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:39.903
WERE ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT BEHIND

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.171
THE TIMES.

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:42.773
WE DO REALIZE THAT SOME OTHER

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.041
ORGANIZATIONS SOMETIMES PRODUCE

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:46.076
THEIR OWN SPENDING RANKINGS --

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:47.511
BUT WOULDN'T LEAVE EXAMINE THOSE

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:48.545
ESTIMATES WE TEND TO FIND THEM

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:49.913
LESS RELIABLE IN A LITTLE BIT

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.883
LESS CONSISTENT THAN WHAT THE

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.284
CENSUS BUREAU PUTS FORWARD.

00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:56.220
SO AS A FIFTEEN SIXTEEN LATEST

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:56.987
YEAR WE HAVEN'T LEADERSHIP WE

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:58.755
HAVE DATA CALIFORNIA RANKS

00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:00.124
TWENTY THIRD IN PER PUPIL

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.459
SPENDING AMONG THE FIFTY STATES

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:04.428
AND DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:05.796
SOME ORGANIZATIONS THOUGH TRY TO

00:46:05.863 --> 00:46:06.930
GO FURTHER AND TRY TO ADJUST

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.665
THAT CENSUS BUREAU DATA FOR THE

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:10.167
REGIONAL VARIATION THAT WE SEE

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:11.768
IN COST ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:46:11.835 --> 00:46:13.971
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA

00:46:14.037 --> 00:46:15.639
IS RELATIVELY HIGH COST STATE.

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.407
THINGS TEND TO COST MORE HERE WE

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:19.476
TEND TO HAVE HIGHER WAGES AND SO

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:22.012
THOSE ADJUSTMENTS TEND TO RESULT

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.380
IN CALIFORNIA DROPPING.

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:24.448
THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:28.719
RELIABLE ACOSTA JUST THE DATA --

00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:29.353
FOR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:30.020
BUT OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS THAT

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:31.722
ONCE THAT DATA DO BECOME

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:32.923
AVAILABLE IN THE COMING MONTHS

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.458
CALIFORNIA WILL PROBABLY RANK IN

00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:36.193
THE MID THIRTIES ON THAT COST

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.529
ADJUSTED DATA.

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:40.264
I THINK THE STATE COMPARISONS

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.565
ARE ALSO REMINDER OF JUST HOW

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:43.600
VOLATILE I SPENDING IS COMPARED

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:44.501
TO OTHER STATES.

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:47.204
FROM 200-078-22000 TEN ELEVEN

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.305
SCHOOL SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:49.540
DROPPED MORE THAN ANY OTHER

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:54.444
STATE AND FROM 200-010-1122

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:55.078
THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IT GREW

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:55.679
FASTER THAN ANY OTHER STATE.

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:58.048
SO SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TO

00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.082
BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO A LOT MORE

00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:01.285
SWINGSAND SPENDING COMPARED TO

00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:04.254
SOME OTHER STATES.

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.189
AT THE TURNING TO PAGE SIX I'D

00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:11.295
LIKE TO SHIFT FROM A LOOK BACK

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:12.696
TO LOOK AHEAD AND WHAT THE MAY

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:13.330
REVISION MIGHT HOLD IN STORE FOR

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:14.064
YOU.

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.299
ON BALANCE WE THINK THERE'S A

00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:16.466
BIT MORE DOWNSIDE AN UPSIDE THIS

00:47:16.533 --> 00:47:17.701
YEAR AS PART AS POSSIBLE CHANGES

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:18.335
IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:18.902
BUDGET.

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:19.836
A PART OF THAT STORY HAS TO DO

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:21.271
WITH REVENUE AS I THINK MOST OF

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:22.573
YOU KNOW THE STOCK MARKET DROPS

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:24.942
NOTABLY AT THE END OF TWENTY

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.176
EIGHTEEN AND THAT DROP HAPPENED

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:26.944
AFTER THE POINT WITH THE

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.246
pADMINISTRATION TYPICALLY LOCKS

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:30.981
DOWN ITS ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS.

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:32.583
A STOCK MARKET HAS MADE UP A LOT

00:47:32.649 --> 00:47:34.084
OF GROUND SINCE THEN BUT WE

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:35.252
STILL THINK WE COULD SEE SOME

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.887
LOWER REVENUE PARTICULARLY IN

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.488
THE CURRENT YEAR.

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:40.190
WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME SIGNS THAT

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:41.758
THE ECONOMY MIGHT BE SLOWING A

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:42.659
TOUCH.

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:43.894
SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE WE'VE HAD

00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:45.562
A SMALL UPTICK IN UNEMPLOYMENT

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:47.397
CLAIMS RECENTLY AND AS WELL AS A

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:49.666
SMALL DOWN TAKEN HOME SALES.

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.735
AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE

00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:52.836
THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.871
GUARANTEE IS SENSITIVE TO OUR

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:56.273
REVENUE ESTIMATES. FOR THE

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.975
ADMINISTRATION STATE EARLIER FOR

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:01.478
EACH DOLLAR BUT FIFTY FIVE CENTS

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:03.313
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.948
NINETEEN AND ABOUT FORTY CENTS

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:06.650
IN.

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:07.284
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY THE

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:07.985
OTHER PART OF THE STORY IS THAT

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:08.819
WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:10.621
BUDGETING EXCLUDE SOME COSTS

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:12.189
THAT ARE LIKELY TO MATERIALIZE

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:13.657
IN THE COMING MONTHS.

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:15.125
THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS RELATED TO

00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:15.993
A KIND OF A ONE TIME PROPERTY

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.362
TAX BACK FILL IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:19.396
IT'S REALLY A KIND OF A

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:20.731
CORRECTION OF SOME PREVIOUS

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:22.699
PROPERTY TAX CALCULATIONS AND

00:48:22.766 --> 00:48:24.301
FROM PRIOR YEARS.

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:25.636
WE ALSO THINK THAT SOME OF YOUR

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:27.004
FORMULA DRIVEN SPENDING PUTTING

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.038
SPENDING AND COUNTY OFFICES OF

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:30.407
EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:32.609
IT'S LIKELY TO BE A BIT HIGHER

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:33.110
THAN THE ADMINISTRATION

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:33.644
ESTIMATES.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:34.411
YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT ALL OF

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:35.712
THESE ISSUES AND SUBSEQUENT

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:37.648
HEARINGS BUT IN TOTAL ACROSS ALL

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.483
OF THE ISSUES YOU'VE IDENTIFIED.

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:40.317
WE THINK THOSE X. ADDITIONAL

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:43.420
COSTS MIGHT BE IN THE RANGE OF A

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:44.988
FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:45.856
AT THE BETWEEN A LOWER MINIMUM

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:47.291
GUARANTEE AND HIGHER COSTS WE

00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:48.959
THINK YOU'RE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:49.593
EIGHT BUDGET COULD BE TIGHTER BY

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.827
MAY.

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:51.962
I TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN WE THINK

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:53.363
YOU HAVE A COUPLE OPTIONS TO

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:56.300
THINK ABOUT TO BEGIN PREPARING

00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:58.101
FOR THOSE POTENTIAL CHANGES. ONE

00:48:58.168 --> 00:48:59.102
IS TO USE THE COMING MONTHS TO

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:00.203
IDENTIFY PROPOSALS THAT YOU

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.705
MIGHT BE WILLING TO REJECT OR

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:04.541
PERHAPS REDUCE OF REVENUE COMES

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:06.610
IN LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED.

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:07.978
IF YOU WOULD IDENTIFY SOME OF

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:08.645
THOSE THINGS NOW THAT'S GOING TO

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:09.613
MAKE.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.882
THE MAJOR REVISION --

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:12.449
CHANGES FOR YOU A LITTLE BIT

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:13.383
EASIER.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.185
BUT WE ALSO THINK YOU SHOULD

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.653
CONSIDER BUILDING.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.888
I SING SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:19.623
PROPOSED ONGOING SPENDING I WITH

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.458
ONE TIME INITIATIVES RIGHT NOW

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:22.726
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:23.760
VIRTUALLY NO.

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:26.296
SPENDING BUILT INTO THE NINETEEN

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:27.798
TWENTY BUDGET THAT'S ONE TIME.

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:28.398
AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:30.167
RISKIER APPROACH COMPARED TO

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:31.335
SOME PREVIOUS YEAR IT'S BECAUSE

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:33.003
THE FUNDING DROPS EITHER NOW OR

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.504
PERHAPS IN A YEAR.

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:35.906
YOU HAVE FEWER THINGS THAT YOU

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:38.975
CAN REDUCE WITHOUT.

00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:40.677
WE THINK THAT BUILDING IN A

00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:41.311
LITTLE BIT MORE ONE TIME FUNDING

00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:42.145
WOULD --

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:43.880
POSITION YOU BETTER TO ADDRESS

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:46.783
ANY DROPS THAT HAPPENED BY NAME.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.151
ABOUT SO TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.720
TELL JUST ADDRESS ONE FINAL

00:49:49.786 --> 00:49:51.221
COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSITION

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:52.356
NINETY PACKAGE.

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:53.490
AT WHICH IS HOW THE STATE

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.092
ADDRESSES CHANGES IN THE MINIMUM

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:57.160
GUARANTEE THAT OCCUR AFTER THE

00:49:57.227 --> 00:49:58.362
YEAR IS OVER.

00:49:58.428 --> 00:49:59.663
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.298
REALLY KIND OF A UNIQUE --

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:02.399
PART OF STATE BUDGET AND NETWORK

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:03.867
IT'S NOT EVEN FINAL ONCE THE

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:04.968
YEAR AND WE HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:06.536
NINE MONTHS AFTER THE END OF THE

00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:10.407
YEAR AT LEAST TO GET FINAL DATA --

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:11.308
THOSE CHANGES HAPPENING AFTER

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:12.676
THE YEAR IS OVER CAN BE IN THE

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:14.478
RANGE OF A FEW OF TENS OF

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:15.812
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO IN SOME

00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:18.448
CASES LOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS.

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:19.716
AT TRADITIONALLY WHEN THE

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:20.917
GUARANTEE IS HIGHER THAN THE

00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:22.152
PREVIOUS ESTIMATE THE STATE

00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:23.620
MAKES A ONE TIME PAYMENT TO

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:25.389
SETTLE UP TO THAT HIGHER FUNDING

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:26.790
LEVEL.

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:28.191
AND WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:29.693
BELOW THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE THE

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.461
STATE TENDS TO REDUCE SCHOOL

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:32.696
FUNDING TO THE LOWER LEVEL.

00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:34.030
AND THE STATE USUALLY MAKES THAT

00:50:34.097 --> 00:50:36.032
REDUCTION BY CLASSIFYING SOME

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:37.300
FUNDING ABOUT THE GUARANTEE IS

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:39.569
BEING RELATED TO A PRIOR FISCAL

00:50:39.636 --> 00:50:41.037
YEAR A YEAR WHERE IT HASN'T

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:42.939
ALREADY MET THE GUARANTEE --

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.174
THAT APPROACH LET'S SCHOOLS KEEP

00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:45.375
THE FUNDING THEY WERE ALREADY

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:47.077
PLANNING TO RECEIVE --

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.678
BUT IT RECOGNIZES THE LOWER BASE

00:50:48.745 --> 00:50:49.813
FOR CALCULATING HE MINIMUM

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.181
GUARANTEED MOVING FORWARD AND

00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:52.416
THE FACT THAT I'M DESCRIBING IS

00:50:52.482 --> 00:50:53.750
EXACTLY WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:56.853
HAS PROPOSED FOR THE EIGHTEEN

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.889
NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR.

00:50:58.955 --> 00:50:59.790
A LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CREATED A

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:01.491
NEW TRUCK PROCESS TO TRY TO

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:02.826
AUTOMATE THOSE UPWARD AND

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:03.927
DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS.

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:06.530
AT THIS WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE

00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:07.898
CHANGES IN THE GUARANTEE AND THE

00:51:07.964 --> 00:51:09.699
ASSOCIATED FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS A

00:51:09.766 --> 00:51:10.934
LITTLE BIT MORE PREDICTABLE A

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:13.069
LITTLE BIT LESS DISRUPTIVE FOR

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:15.272
BOTH SCHOOLS AND THE STATE.

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:16.173
A TURNING TO PAGE NINE THE

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:17.207
GOVERNOR HAS TO PROPOSALS

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:18.675
RELATED TO DROPS.

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:20.944
HE'S PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE THE

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:22.712
AUTOMATIC PROCESS COULD LAST

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:23.380
YEAR.

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:24.381
AND TO PROHIBIT THE STATE FOR

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:27.384
MAKING GET WELL FUNDING IN THE

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:29.619
PRIOR YEAR WILL STILL REQUIRE AN

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:32.489
UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS --

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:34.724
WE THINK THAT --

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:36.460
IF YOU ADOPT THOSE PROPOSALS YOU

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:38.495
WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE COMMITTING

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:39.729
TO HAVING ANY DROPS IN STATE

00:51:39.796 --> 00:51:40.397
REVENUE.

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:42.532
IN THE PRIOR YEAR FALL ENTIRELY

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.967
ON THE NONPROFIT THIS NINETY

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:45.368
EIGHT SIDE OF THE BUDGET.

00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:46.303
AND WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:48.205
MAKE YOUR OVERALL BUDGET MORE

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:49.539
DIFFICULT TO BALANCE.

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.141
A BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:53.176
POTENTIALLY IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:54.811
TO AND THAT'S BECAUSE FUNDING

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:56.046
ABOVE THE GUARANTEE AND ONE YEAR

00:51:56.112 --> 00:51:57.614
BECOMES PART OF THAT BASE FOR

00:51:57.681 --> 00:51:59.316
CALCULATING THE MINIMUM

00:51:59.382 --> 00:52:00.550
GUARANTEE THE NEXT YEAR.

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:01.885
AND SO FOR BOTH OF THOSE REASONS

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:02.986
WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THE

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:04.521
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:06.890
PRESERVE YOUR FLEXIBILITY.

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:09.025
TO FIND OUT THE GUARANTEE OR

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:09.659
SOME OTHER LEVEL IF THAT'S WHAT

00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:12.362
YOU CHOOSE.

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:13.196
THAT'S THE TURNING TO PAGE TEN

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:14.865
I'D LIKE TO TRANSITION TO THE

00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:16.233
OTHER HALF OF YOUR AGENDA.

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:17.367
EVERYTHING I JUST TOLD YOU

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.035
RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:20.737
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET --

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.372
BUT THE NEXT FEW PAGES COVER

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.941
YOUR EARLY EDUCATION BUDGET THIS

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:25.141
YEAR.

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:27.577
AND UNLIKE WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:28.912
THIS PART OF YOUR BUDGET IS

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.747
ALMOST ENTIRELY OUTSIDE OF

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.215
PROPOSITION.

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:33.316
NINETY EIGHT SO THE CHART ON

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:35.185
PAGE TEN JUST LIST THE PROPOSALS

00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:38.021
IN THIS YEAR'S EARLY EDUCATION --

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:39.789
BUDGET AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS IT'S

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:43.059
A MIX OF ONE TIME INITIATIVES

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:45.295
AND NEW ON GOING COMMITMENTS.

00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:46.162
TURNING TO PAGE ELEVEN THE

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:47.964
LARGEST PROPOSAL IS SEVEN

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:49.633
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR

00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:51.334
KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANTS.

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:52.168
AND THIS BUILDS UPON SOME

00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:54.437
FUNDING YOU ALLOCATED THIS

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:56.473
COURAGE DISTRICTS TO CONVERT

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.240
THEIR PART TAKEN THE GARDEN

00:52:57.307 --> 00:53:00.243
PROGRAMS TO FULL DAY PROGRAMS.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:01.778
IN REVIEWING THE APPLICATIONS

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:04.514
THAT THE STATE'S RECEIVED SO FAR --

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:05.916
WE'VE CONCLUDED THAT THE CLINTON

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:07.150
GRANTS DON'T SEEM TO BE

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:09.019
ADVANCING YOUR CORE OBJECTIVE

00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:10.787
MOST OF THE APPLICANTS APPLYING

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:13.089
FOR THIS FUNDING ARE ARE ALREADY

00:53:13.156 --> 00:53:14.424
RUNNING FULL DAY PROGRAMS ARE

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:16.026
NOT APPLYING TO CONVERT TO RUN

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.761
MORE.

00:53:17.827 --> 00:53:19.162
MORE OF THOSE PROGRAMS.

00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:21.498
AND SO IN SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:22.065
YOU'LL HEAR US LAY OUT SOME

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:23.366
ALTERNATIVES.

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:24.501
THAT COULD PROVIDE STRONGER

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:26.202
INCENTIVES FOR FULL DAY PROGRAMS

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:28.238
AT A LOWER COST IN THE MEANTIME

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:29.439
WE RECOMMEND YOU HOLD OFF AND

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:31.441
NOT PROVIDE THE PROPOSED SEVEN

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:32.542
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:34.711
ADDITIONAL CAN GUARDED GRANTS AT

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:36.079
THIS POINT.

00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:36.947
AND SO WITH THAT LET ME TURN

00:53:37.013 --> 00:53:38.882
THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.350
TAKE US THROUGH THE FINAL --

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:41.952
PARTS OF OUR HAND OUT.

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:43.353
GOOD MORNING SERRA CORTEZ WITH

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.187

ELEVEN IS WITH REGARDS TO THE

00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:59.369
ONE TIMEFUNDING THE GOVERNOR

PROPOSES FOR WORK FORCE AND

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:02.572
FACILITY PURPOSE SAYS.

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:05.375
I'M IN WE GIVEN THE LACK OF DATA --

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:06.676
AVAILABLE ON WORKFORCE AND

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.912
FACILITY ISSUES WE THINK MAKING

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:11.281
OF PRIORITIZING A ONE TIME CHILD

00:54:11.348 --> 00:54:12.315
CARE AND PRESCHOOL FUNDING IN

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:14.150
THIS AREA IS CHALLENGING ON THE

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:15.418
GOOD NEWS IS THAT SOME KEY

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:17.187
INFORMATION IS COMING IN THE

00:54:17.253 --> 00:54:18.622
NEXT YEAR OR TWO AND THERE COULD

00:54:18.688 --> 00:54:20.056
ALSO BE SOME ADDITIONAL

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:21.725
INFORMATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:22.826
MAY WANT --

00:54:22.892 --> 00:54:25.195
TO HAVE BEFORE IMPLEMENTING A

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:28.598
TARGET ISSUES WITH HER --

00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:31.534
IN AND IN SPECIFIC REGIONS.

00:54:31.601 --> 00:54:33.203
A WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATOR

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:34.804
THE LEGISLATURE SATISFIED SOME

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:36.373
OF THE FUNDING AND ALLOCATED IN

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:37.874
FUTURE YEARS AS IT GETS BETTER

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:40.143
INFORMATION.

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:41.745
UNDER THE THIRD BULLET HERE IS

00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:43.446
WITH REGARDS TO THE PRE SCHOOL

00:54:43.513 --> 00:54:44.981
EXPANSION --

00:54:45.048 --> 00:54:46.383
THE GOVERNOR ADDS TEN THOUSANDS

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:47.851
PRESCHOOL SLOTS IN NINETEEN

00:54:47.917 --> 00:54:49.185
TWENTY AND WE THINK THIS --

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:51.021
EXPANSION IS QUITE AMBITIOUS --

00:54:51.087 --> 00:54:52.122
THERE'S MANY LOGISTICAL

00:54:52.188 --> 00:54:53.189
CHALLENGES FROM STATE

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:54.557
ADMINISTRATION AND ON THE

00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:58.361
PROVIDER LEVEL --

00:54:58.428 --> 00:54:59.262
ON THAT --

00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.863
THAT AND WE SUGGESTS A SLOWER

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:01.865
RAMP UP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:03.633
LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.768
AND THE LAST THE FINAL BULLET

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:06.002
HERE IS WITH REGARDS TO

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:08.304
ELIMINATING THE WORK REQUIREMENT

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:10.073
FOR FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL SO

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.474
UNDER CURRENT LAW PART A STEEPER

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:12.375
SCHOOL DOESN'T HAVE A WORK

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:14.144
REQUIREMENT AND FULL DAY STATE

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.445
PRESCHOOL DOES --

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:17.313
WE THINK THAT THIS ELIMINATING

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.815
THIS REQUIREMENT COULD HAVE

00:55:18.882 --> 00:55:20.450
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES --

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:22.852
THAT.

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:23.420
AND AND HERE'S TO SPECIFIC

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:24.621
CONSEQUENCES THAT WE HIGHLIGHT

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:25.722
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COULD

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:27.724
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.426
OF THE PROGRAM --

00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:31.494
AS A FULL DAY COST A FULL DAY

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:33.797
SLOT COSTS OVER TO OF OVER TWO

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:35.598
TIMES THE COST OF A PART DAIS

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:36.099
THOUGHT --

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:38.802
AND ABSENT ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:40.036
THE PROGRAM COULD RESULT IN

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:42.105
FEWER OVERALL CHILDREN AS WELL

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.707

FAMILIES BEING SERVED UP WITH WE

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:47.343
RECOMMEND REJECTING --

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.312
ELIMINATING THE WORK REQUIREMENT

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:50.714

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PAST

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:21.324
COUPLE OF YEAR IS THE NUMBER OF

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:22.825

DISABILITIES.

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:25.895
HOVERED JUST BELOW 11% FOR A

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:28.197
VERY LONG TIME FOR DECADES AND

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.899
IT'S STARTED ACCELERATING ABOUT

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.901
SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO AND

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:33.636
IT'S BEEN GROWING AT A MUCH

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:35.705
FASTER THAN INFLATION THE PAST

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:36.406
COUPLE YEARS.

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:37.573
METICULOUS EARLY THE COSTS HAVE

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.242
BEEN GOING UP BECAUSE MANY OF

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.710
THE STUDENTS NEWLY IDENTIFIED

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.881
AUTISM.

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:46.049
AND SO THAT'S BEEN KIND OF A

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:47.450
SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURE FOR

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:49.686
DISTRICTS AS ACCOMMODATING THOSE

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:51.187

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.361
TO DO THAT.

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:32.895
AND I'M NOT I DON'T NEED YOU TO

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:33.997
COMMENT ON THAT BUT AGAIN I JUST

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.331
WORK SOME OF SPEAKER BUYS INTO

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:36.432
THIS.

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:38.001
THIS THIS MANTRA THAT'S KIND OF

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:38.835
BEEN.

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:40.937
SATURATED IN INFUSED INTO THE

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:41.738
THING HERE I HAVE A JEEP

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:42.872
PROPOSITION ANYWHERE THEY GOT

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:44.674
MORE THAN NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:45.575
THAN THAN THAN THAN THAT.

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:46.843
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT'S A

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.344
PROBLEM NO THAT'S A GOOD THING --

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:49.479
BECAUSE IT'S TO SPEAK TO THE

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:50.380
INVESTMENT OUR CHILDREN IS THE

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:51.914
INVESTMENT A FUTURIST EIGHT I

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.449
THINK THIS THIS COMMITTEE REALLY

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:54.317
THIS YEAR AND IS IT NEEDS TO

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.284
THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.652
WE SHOULD NOT.

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.654
BE SET UP FOR THAT TYPE OF

01:00:58.721 --> 01:00:59.622
THINKING WE SHOULD NOT JUST SIT

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:00.556
DOWN.

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.692
AND WE SHOULD NOT JUST KICKED

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:03.292
THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD WHAT WE

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:06.195
SHOULD --

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.296
AND THEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:08.731
FULL THEY CAN --

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:09.732
PROGRAM AND I'VE HAD.

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:11.300
YOU KNOW QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:12.368
PROGRAM FOR A LONG TIME AND I

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:13.770
KNOW ON THE FACILITY SIDE A LOT

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.405
OF THAT MONEY IS NOT NINETY

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.406
EIGHT BUT IT'S STILL MONEY.

01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:17.740
IN THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.075
SOMETHING ELSE THE EDUCATION

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.110
SPHERE --

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:23.279
HOW MUCH EMPHASIS HAS THERE BEEN?

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.148
WE TALK ABOUT FULL THEY CAN --

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:25.948
FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT DON'T

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:26.883
HAVE HAVE FILLED AGAIN HOW MUCH

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:28.051
EMPHASIS HAS THERE BEEN WITHIN

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:30.353
THIS PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE.

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.688
PARTICULARLY TITLE ONE SCHOOLS

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:33.956
TO DEVELOP FULL THEY CAN --

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.558
BECAUSE I REALLY I THINK YOU

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:36.659
KNOW -- FOR

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:38.728
FOR FOR YOU KNOW MY OWN HOUSE I

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:39.328
WOULD SAY FULL THEY CAN THERE

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:40.096
WOULD BE A WANT.

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:41.531
BUT IN A TITLE ONE SCHOOL IT'S A

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:42.698
NEED.

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:43.866
I BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:46.169
FOCUS ON THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.170
SO HOW MUCH EMPHASIS HAS THE

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:48.538
PROGRAM PUT OR GOING FORWARD

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:49.472
WILL THERE BE.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.908
AND REALLY INCENTIVIZING THOSE

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.242
THOSE THOSE TAIWAN.

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:55.711
OUR TITLE ONE SCHOOLS TO CREATE

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:57.246
FULL THEY CAN NEVER.

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.948
GARDEN PROGRAMS FASTER.

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:02.285
MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY YES YES THANK

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:03.419
YOU SOMETHING MEMBER O'DONNELL

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:05.221
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AFTER THE

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:07.657
CURRENT ROUND OF OF FUNDING THE

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:09.792
PROGRAM DOES PRIORITIZE --

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:11.527
DISTRICTS BASED THAT HAVE

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.062
RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBERS OF LOW

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.297
INCOME STUDENTS AND DISTRICT

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:15.865
THAT HAVE TROUBLE RAISING THEIR

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:16.866
LOCAL MATCH.

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.234
I ONE OF THAT SORT OF

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:19.635
INTERESTING THINGS IS THAT LOW

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.304
INCOME STUDENTS ARE LOW INCOME

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.872
DISTRICTS ALREADY A BIT.

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:24.373
MORE LIKELY TO OFFER FULL DAY

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.741
PROGRAMS THAT MORE AT THE MORE

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:27.043
AFFLUENT COUNTERPARTS.

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.479
AND SO IN PRIORITIZING THE WAY

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:30.913
THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED NOW

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.281
MORE FUNDING WILL PROBABLY GO TO

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:34.050
THOSE LOW INCOME DISTRICTS.

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:35.384
BUT IT WON'T GO FOR CONVERTING

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:38.488
PARKED AT A FULL DAY PROGRAMS

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:40.123
WILL GO FOR A SORT OF UPGRADES

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.257
AND RETROFITS WITHIN DISTRICT

01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:42.859
THAT ARE ALREADY RUNNING THOSE

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:43.993
FULL DAY PROGRAMS.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:44.594
SO THIS MONEY AS AN ONLY TO

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.728
INCENTIVIZE THE CREATION OF FULL

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:46.863
THEY CAN --

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.531
BUT TO ENHANCE THE FULL THEY CAN --

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.099
SPIRITS.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.100
RIGHT DISTRICTS COULD USE THAT

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.568
IN EITHER WAY I THINK WHEN THE

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:54.370
PROGRAM WAS CREATED.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.872
MANY MEMBERS WERE CONCERNED WERE

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:57.540
INTERESTED IN HAVING AN

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.375
INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE MORE --

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.711
FULL DAY PROGRAMS BUT ALSO ALLOW

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.679
UPGRADES POTENTIALLY --

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:04.647
BUT THE WAY THE PROGRAM HAS

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.249
UNFOLDED SO FAR IT'S KIND OF

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:07.917
BEEN THE REVERSE MOST OF THE

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:08.885
FUNDING IS GOING FOR UPGRADE

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.620
CERTAIN POLITICALLY SMALL CHAIR

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:13.256
SHARES GOING TO CONVERT PARKED

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:14.157
IN A FULL DAY.

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.658
WE SAY UPGRADE WHAT DOING BUYING

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.593
PURCHASING A TRAILER UP I MEAN

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.529
WHAT.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:20.530
IN A CLASSROOM TO CLASSROOM WITH

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:21.764
A WHEN THEY HAVE TO MEET SOME

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:22.298
DIFFERENT STANDARD MAYBE.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:22.965
YEAH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:24.500
HAS KIND OF A LONG LIST OF

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:25.968
STANDARDS THAT KINDERGARTEN

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.436
CLASSROOMS ARE SUPPOSED TO MEET

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:29.105
EVERYTHING FROM KIND OF THE

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:30.173
HEIGHT OF THE FURNITURE IN THE

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:31.474
ROOM TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.042
CLASSROOM RELATIVE TO THE PARENT

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:34.177
DROP OFF AREA.

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:36.012
AND SO DISTRICTS COULD APPLY FOR

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:37.747
FUNDING UNDER THIS GRANT TO MAKE

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:38.347
SOME OF THOSE CHANGES TO THAT

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.883
CLASSROOM OR EVEN CONSTRUCTING

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:41.984
NEW CLASSROOM IF THEY WANTED.

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:43.786
AND I WOULD JUST CAUTION WHEN WE

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:44.353
TALK ABOUT FULL THEY CAN --

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.089
RESEARCH BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:48.558
BECAUSE NOW OFTENTIMES THEY'LL

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:49.492
BE HAPPY CAN --

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:51.460
AND THE TEACHER WILL SPEND THEY

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:52.094
WILL HAVE THEIR OWN CLASS HALF

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.263
THE DAY AND THEY WILL MOVE INTO

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.464
ANOTHER CLASSROOM GAVE THE

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:56.666
DISTRICTS DOING RIGHT.

01:03:56.732 --> 01:03:57.233
THEY WILL MOVE INTO ANOTHER

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.035
CLASS FROM THE OTHER BASICALLY

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:00.203
MOST OF THE OTHER HALF OF THE

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:01.671
DAY SO YOU'LL ACTUALLY HAVE

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:03.506
DOUBLE COVERAGE IN THAT CLASS

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:05.074
AND YOU HAVE TO TEACHERS MOVING

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:07.243
AROUND THAT'S OFTEN HOW IT WORKS

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:07.843
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS LIKE

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.011
THAT NEVER DISTRICT.

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:10.112
BUTWHAT THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:12.315
YOU GO TO FULL DAYS YOU HAVE ONE

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:13.449
TEACHER ALL DAY.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.917
INSTEAD OF TWO TEACHERS PART OF

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:15.585
THE DAY SO YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.119
DO THAT PULL OUT.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:18.421
YOU KNOW WHAT THE STUDENT CENTER

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:19.155
MAYBE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:20.890
SUPPORT SO I I JUST HOPE THAT

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:21.958
PEOPLE.

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:22.959
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.794
THE CLASSROOM TO NOT JUST WILL

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:25.094
THEY CAN --

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.062
GREAT THERE WE GO.

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:27.163
RIGHT AND I THINK THE WAY YOU

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:28.764
ARTICULATED IS EXACTLY HOW IT

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.600
TENDS TO PLAY OUT IN IN PRACTICE

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.268
IT TENDS TO BE PARKED A PROGRAMS

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:33.903
ARE TO TEACHERS SWITCHING OFF.

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:35.504
AND WHEN WE TALK TO DISTRICTS

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:36.539
MANY OF THEM SAID THEIR TEACHERS

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:37.974
DID PREFER AT BECAUSE THEY HAD

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.041
THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO NAY

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:40.876
COULD DO THOSE KINDS OF

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.111
PULLOUT'S YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT --

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:43.212
WITH MORE OF A FULL DAY MODEL

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:44.647
IT'S TYPICALLY JUST ONE TEACHER

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:45.815
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.316
IN SOME CASES THEY MAY HAVE AN

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:48.551
INSTRUCTIONAL AIDE ALTHOUGH A

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:49.485
LOT OF DISTRICTS DON'T PROVIDE

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:50.019
THAT.

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:51.654
AND SO IT SOME GIVEN THE CHOICE

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.089
BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS SOME

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:55.758
TEACHERS AND AND SOME PARENTS DO

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:56.959
PREFER THE PART DAY APPROACH.

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.594
RATE IN AND AGAIN PLANNING FOR A

01:04:58.661 --> 01:04:59.762
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM --

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.331
THERE'S A LOT OF PLANNING

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:02.932
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF HANDS

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:06.402
ON OUT OF STUFF.

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:08.170
PRIOR TO THE START OF THE DAY

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:09.505
AND THEY NEED MORE TIME OFF OF

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.374
PLANNING AND AND AND AND TO

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.642
CREATE THOSE THOSE DIFFERENT

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:13.909
ACTIVITIES.

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:15.278
AND THE MANIPULATIVESIX CETERA

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.946
THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:17.913
ACTIVITIES AND CLASSROOM

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.115
TYPICALLY GONNA TAKE MORE TIME

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:21.917
AND YOU KNOW I IS A MIDDLE SKATE

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:22.551
MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER FOR A LONG

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:23.419
TIME.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:24.086
TO SO THANK YOU AND I DON'T KNOW

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:25.988
OF ANY OTHERS WISH TO COMMENT ON

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:29.292
ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS.

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:29.859
QUITE OFTEN HEARING IT TEARS

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:31.594
OKAY WITH THAT.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:32.528
I SHOULDN'T WHERE THIRTY SO WITH

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:33.129

AND AS I SIT HERE --

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:37.513
IT SEEMS LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.081
THE THE POSITION RELATIVE

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:42.084

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.288
NOTCHES.

01:08:46.355 --> 01:08:49.558

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.663
BECAUSE AS YOU PROBABLY --

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:56.866
WERE ALLUDING TO THE FIGURE THAT

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:58.167
I'VE SEEN.

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.902
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS IS THAT

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.271
CALIFORNIA IS IT SOMEWHERE IN

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:03.639
THE LOWER FORTIES.

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:08.177
IN PER PUPIL SPENDING --

01:09:08.244 --> 01:09:09.478

THIS THE FIRST TIME I EVER SEE

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:10.946
[inaudible]

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:13.148
ANYWHERE.

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:16.485
CLOSE TO THE TWENTY SO IF YOU

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:18.120
COULD PLEASE.

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:19.822
ELABORATE THAT BECAUSE I'M VERY

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:21.290
SURPRISED BY THIS.

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:23.592
SURE SO I THINK THIS GOES BACK

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:24.393
TO A LITTLE BIT OF THE LEG IN

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.128
THE CENSUS BUREAU DATA HAD A LOT

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:27.062
OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE MORE

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:27.897
EFFECTIVE OF WHERE THE STATE

01:09:27.963 --> 01:09:29.798
STOOD KIND OF IN THE RECESSION

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:30.533
YEARS.

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:32.701
A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.136
IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:34.970
OR TWO OF THE BEST YEARS THAT IN

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:35.838
SCHOOL FUNDING THAT THE STATE

01:09:35.905 --> 01:09:37.406
HAS HAD IN A VERY LONG TIME AND

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:38.574
BOTH OF THOSE YEARS FUNDING WAS

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:40.943
GOING NEARLY 10% YEAR OVER YEAR.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.646
AND SO AS THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.447
KIND OF UPDATED ITS DATA AND

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:46.749
INCORPORATED THOSE ADJUSTMENTS

01:09:46.815 --> 01:09:48.417
CALIFORNIA HAS MOVED UP PRETTY

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:49.718
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:51.020
A WE WERE RANKED --

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:52.955
FAIRLY IN THE LOW FORTIES DURING

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:54.657
THE RECESSION YEARS BUT I WITH

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:55.858
THE MOVING UP WITH SOME OF THOSE

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:57.192
INCREASES AND PROBABLY WILL

01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:58.761
CONTINUE TO MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:00.629
BECAUSE THE PAST FEW YEARS WE'VE

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:01.397
ALSO HAD.

01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:03.399
SOME FAIRLY STEADY INCREASES IN

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.868
SCHOOL FUNDING BEYOND THAT.

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:06.468
I I YOU KNOW I'M GONNA GO OUT

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:10.439
AND AND AND AND CHECK BUT I

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:11.674
DON'T SEE ANYONE AGREED WITH THE

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.709
WITH THE THOSE NUMBERS SO IF I

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:15.411
COULD JUST ADD THE THE OTHER --

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:17.379
FACTOR THAT YOU YOU CAN NEED TO

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:19.648
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS THE

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.483
COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:22.918
THAT'S THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LOT

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:23.819
OF DIFFERENT.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.588
NUMBERS FLOATING AROUND AS TO

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:27.656
WHERE WE RANK --

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:30.426
WHEN YOU DO TAKE INTO THE COST

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:32.595
OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA THE COST

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:33.562
OF DOING BUSINESS THE?

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:36.198
HOW FAR THAT THE DOLLARS THAT

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:37.700
THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT RECEIVED

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.568
HOW FOR THE CONSTRUCTION HOW

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:41.003
MUCH THEY CAN SPEND TO IN THE ON

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.439
THE ON THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES?

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:48.210
VERSES THE THE OTHER OTHER COSTS --

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.312
THE OTHER IT COSTS A LOT MORE TO

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:55.484
DO BUSINESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.052
TO TO TO DO --

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:59.788
ALL YOUR UTILITY COSTS --

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:00.623
AO.

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:01.857
LAND BECAUSE BUILDING COSTS

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.392
CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE ALL THESE

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.594
COSTS ARE HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.529
AND SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU FACTOR

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:08.097
THAT IN.

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:10.132
AT NEO CALIFORNIA DROPS

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.167
PRECIPITOUSLY RELATIVE TO OTHER

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.436
STATES IN TERMS OF RANKINGS.

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:16.105
WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.706
LIKE CLASS SIZE --

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:19.341
IN CALIFORNIA IT COMPARED TO

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:20.709
OTHER STATES ARE COMPARED TO

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.778
STATES THAT SPEND MORE OF PER

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:24.413
PUPIL AS YOU COMPARE

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.315
CALIFORNIA'S CLASS SIZE TO WHAT

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:27.549
I UNDERSTAND.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.385
CLASS SIZES IN PLACES LIKE

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.186
CONNECTICUT --

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:34.723
IT IT'S DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT --

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:35.758
AND DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT OF

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.259
WHAT WE ASK OUR TEACHERS IN

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.594
CALIFORNIA TO DO --

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:40.496
WITH A CLASS OF THIRTY SIX

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:42.097
STUDENTS OR THAT YOU WOULD ASK A

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:43.465
TEACHER AND I'M JUST USING

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:45.234
CONNECTICUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.969
MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM.

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:50.139
UP WITH THE CLASS SIZE OF TWENTY

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:51.173
AND AND I THINK THE RESULTS

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.708
MIGHT MAYOR --

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.677
BEAR THAT OUT THAT'S TRUE WE DO

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.578
WE DO HAVE LARGER CLASS SIZES

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:59.314
THAN MOST OTHER STATES

01:11:59.381 --> 01:11:59.615

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:25.207
COMING OUT OF THESE TEACHER

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:26.175
STRIKES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:28.811
HIGHLIGHTING --

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:31.814
IN THEIR EYES A CRISIS

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.114
[inaudible]

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:36.218
OF THE LACK OF THE INADEQUATE

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.094
WOULD NOTE THAT --

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.028
WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:47.796
DIMINISH THE EXPERIENCES OF

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:50.199
DISTRICTS LIKE THAT BUT I THINK

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:51.867
WE WOULD ALSO POINT --

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:53.135
TO THE FLEXIBILITY CERTAINLY

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:55.170

YEARS SINCE ITS ENACTMENT --

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:01.710
AND I THINK THE PROPOSAL --

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:03.178
WITH THE COASTERS --

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:04.646

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:13.589
PRESSURES OF GROWING COST WITHIN

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:15.557
DISTRICTS THAT I'M OFTEN YOU

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:16.558

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.493
THERE REALLY CAUGHT BETWEEN A

LIGHT AS WELL AND INTO THE WORK

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:32.941

CLEARLY --

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:31.466
INCREASES BETTER THAN A DECREASE --

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:33.836
BUT I I KNOW THAT THE LAST TIME

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:35.637

EDUCATION WEEKLY --

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.413
A RANKING OF CALIFORNIA --

LIVING I BELIEVE WAS FORTY FIRST

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:52.421
IN THE NATION I I BELIEVE THAT'S

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.590
BEEN THE NUMBER THAT'S BEEN --

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:59.061

IN JUST POINTING OUT THAT THAT

01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:18.180
DATA --

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:20.115
UNFORTUNATELY IS LAGGED SELECT

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:20.549
DELI --

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:21.750
POINTEDOUT THAT RIGHT THE

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:22.918
RANKING THAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:24.419
CITING WITH ED WEEK --

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.154
IS BASED ON FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DATA

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:28.624
BUT ALSO AS A PART OF EDUCATION

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:29.358
NOTED --

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:30.726
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT A COST OF

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:31.827
LIVING ADJUSTMENT USING WHAT'S

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:33.395
CALLED A COMPARABLE WAGE INDEX

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:34.997
WHICH BASICALLY TAKES INTO

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:35.797
ACCOUNT --

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:38.567
SALARIES FOR NON EDUCATIONAL --

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:39.835
EMPLOYEES.

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:41.837
IN IN WHATEVER REGION THEY'RE

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:44.539
THEY'RE LOOKING DATA WERE IN THE

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:46.074
LOW TWENTIES WITH THAT

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:47.476
ADJUSTMENT FOR COST OF LIVING

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.311
THAT TAKES US UP TO FORTY FIRST

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.213
BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT --

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.781
THAT NOT WITHSTANDING THE COST

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:54.216
OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT ONE WAY OR

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:56.184
THE OTHER --

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:57.719
SENSE.

01:15:57.786 --> 01:15:58.954
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE LC A FAST

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.455
HAS RECEIVED JUST OVER TEN

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:01.657
BILLION DOLLARS --

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:02.858
UP THROUGH THE CURRENT BUDGET

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:04.393
THAT'S PROPOSED NOW AND

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:05.427
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ON THE

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:07.529

THIRTEEN POINT SIX BILLION

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:09.665
DOLLARS AN INCREASE FUNDING.

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:11.099
SENSE THOSE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:12.701
LEVEL SO WE WOULD ASSUME LIKE

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:13.168
THE LA --

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.636
POINTED OUT THAT --

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.305
WE WOULD START SEEING A RANKING

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:18.573
NOW IS AS THE THE GEAR START TO

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.775
SORT OF CATCH UP --

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.109
THAT THESE RANKINGS ARE DONE FOR

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.077
RESEARCH HERE BREAKING THAT'S A

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:23.745
LITTLE BIT MORE INDICATIVE OF

01:16:23.812 --> 01:16:26.515
YOU SUGGESTED AS A A MORE

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:27.916
BURGEONING ECONOMY.

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:29.084
AND IF I CAN JUST GATHER SO THE

01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:29.718
LATEST DATA FROM AND WE COULD

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.987
ACTUALLY FROM TWO THOUSAND

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:33.055
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SO.

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:35.090
FOR AT LEASTFOUR YEARS OLD --

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:36.358
I THINK THE STATE PUBLIC DID

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:37.893
STAND IN THE FORTIES AT THAT

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.895
POINT -- BUT

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:41.396
GIVEN THE NEW SORT OF THAT

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:43.198
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES THE STATE

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.166
PROVIDED IN SOME SUBSEQUENT

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.367
YEARS ARE PROBABLY NO MORE IN

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:46.268
THE MID HIRTIES.

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:47.703
NOW YOU MAY NOT STILL BE

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:48.937
SATISFIED WITH THAT RANKING

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:49.905
COMPARED WITH OTHER STATES AND

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:51.340
YOU MIGHT WANT TO IMPROVE UPON

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:52.240
IT MORE.

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:54.009
AND WE CAN HELP YOU THINK ABOUT

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.445
WAYS TO DO THAT.

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:57.746
THE HOW WELL THE ECONOMY IS DONE

01:16:57.813 --> 01:16:58.814
THE PAST FEW YEARS OUR RANKING

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.482
HAS BEEN MOVING UP RELATIVE TO

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:02.517
OTHER STATES.

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:05.187
HI I I APPRECIATE THAT --

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:07.089
YOU KNOW STATISTICS --

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:09.458
AND AND AND NUMBERS CAN BE

01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:09.758
DIFFERENT --

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.793
DEPENDING ON WHO YOU'RE.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.461
TALKING TO AND WHAT THEIR AGENDA

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:14.162
IS -- BUT I

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:16.031
I THINK YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS

01:17:16.098 --> 01:17:17.332
AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT --

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:18.967
YOU KNOW OAKLEY UNIFIED A I

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:20.535
BELIEVE THEY JUST --

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:21.803
TO THE OAKLAND SCHOOL BOARD JUST

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.271
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE GONNA

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:24.272
HAVE TO LAY OFF --

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:26.308
OF OVER A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:29.678
CLOSE DOWN PROGRAMS --

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:33.248
IN ORDER TO AFFORD AT THIS 11% --

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.850
TEACHER PAY INCREASE THAT --

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:37.486
THAT THE THAT THEY NEGOTIATED TO

01:17:37.552 --> 01:17:39.388
SETTLE THE OAKLAND STRIKE AND

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:41.590
AND AND SO THE REALITY IS THAT

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:43.291
YOU KNOW WHILE WE'RE TALKING

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:44.192
ABOUT -- YOU

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:46.228
KNOW HOW HOW HOW GOOD WE ARE

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:48.397
DOING IN TERMS OF INCREASING

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:50.532
STATE FUNDING THE THE REALITY

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:52.734
THAT THAT THE THAT THAT ARE THAT

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.436
ARE THE SCHOOL CHILDREN AND OUR

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.038
TEACHERS IN OUR AND OUR

01:17:56.104 --> 01:17:58.306
COMMUNITIES ARE FACING --

01:17:58.373 --> 01:17:59.775

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:03.078
OUR OUR OUR CUTS AND AND AND JOB

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:04.813
LOSSES AND AND PROGRAM.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.381
A PROGRAM LOSSES AND SO.

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:09.651
YOU KNOW I I YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:11.153
OF THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:13.188
THIS IS BEING DRIVEN BY.

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:14.923
INCREASING FIXED COSTS --

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.558
AND I KNOW THAT SPECIAL

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:18.860
EDUCATION IS ONE OF THOSE BIG --

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:20.328
ACOSTA BUT I I JUST WANNA MAKE

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:22.397
SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIDE IN

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:23.832
A WAY WE WE DON'T --

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:24.900
IN A WHILE WE'RE AT PATTING

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.568
OURSELVES ON THE BACK IN IN

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:28.970
TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:30.872
DOING ON ON K. THROUGH TWELVE

01:18:30.939 --> 01:18:33.075
EDUCATION FUNDING THE REALITY IN

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:34.009
OUR COMMUNITIES --

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:37.412
ARE JOB LOSSES IN PROGRAM CUTS --

01:18:37.479 --> 01:18:38.980
AND AND I I THINK THIS GOES TO

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:41.216
MR DOLLARS POINT ABOUT HOW WE

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.384
NEED -- TO

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:43.485
MAKE THE POLITICAL COMMITMENT

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:47.289
HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL IN ORDER.

01:18:47.355 --> 01:18:50.225
TO TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDING --

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:53.195
IF I MAY A MINIATURE --

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:56.364
I WOULD LIKE --

01:18:56.431 --> 01:18:59.201
TO SEGUE --

01:18:59.267 --> 01:19:00.769
TO THE LA ALL PRESENTATION AND

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:03.038
ESPECIALLY THE ALLY --

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:06.575
YOUR YOUR REPORT WHICH I YOU

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:10.345
HAVE IN AND AND PAGE --

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.747
FIFTEEN OF YOUR REPORT --

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:16.084
THE L. C. F. F. FUNDING TARGETS

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:18.353
AND HOW THE STATE.

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.688
HAS BEEN --

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:21.189
A PROGRESSING BASED ON THE

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:22.457
FUNDING TARGETS THAT WERE

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:24.960
ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED IN --

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:25.727
TWENTY THIRTEEN YOU RECOGNIZE

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:27.662
THIS GRASS YES AND SO WHAT WOULD

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:29.264
YOU SAY THAT THIS GRAPH AND OR

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:32.033
OR THE THE LCF FUNDING TARGETS.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.603
THAT WE ESTABLISH IN TWENTY

01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:35.670
THIRTEEN YOU KNOW WAS THE THEY

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:37.072
THEY WERE THEY THEY THE GUIDING

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:38.540
BENCHMARKS AGAINST WHICH WE

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:41.676
MEASURE OUR PROGRESS TOWARD --

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:44.546
THE THE THE GOAL THAT WE SET IN

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:45.647
TWENTY THIRTEEN IN TERMS OF

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:47.616
GETTING BACK TO THE PRE

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:49.718
RECESSION --

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:51.486
FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE STATE.

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:52.354
WHEN WE CREATED THAT WHEN THE

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.488
STATE CREATED THOSE TARGETS BACK

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:56.091
IN? TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:56.758
FOURTEEN I I THINK ORIGINALLY IN

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:58.326
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT WAS

01:19:58.393 --> 01:19:59.227
TO GET BACK TO THE SEVEN EIGHT

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:00.529
LEVELS SOME MEMBERS OF THE

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:01.863
LEGISLATURE THOUGHT THAT WASN'T

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.331
AMBITIOUS ENOUGH AND SO WE SET

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:04.566
TARGET THERE A LITTLE BIT.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.433
ACTUALLY ABOVE WHERE WE WERE

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.570
BACK IN --

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:09.204
TWO THOUSAND AND I THINK THE WAY

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:10.605
WE HAVE COME UP WITH THOSE

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:12.040
TARGETS AS WE TRY TO THINK ABOUT

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.742
WELL HOW MUCH MIGHT THE

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:14.476
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:16.178
GUARANTEE GROW OVER THE NEXT

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:16.978
SEVEN EIGHT YEARS.

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.013
AND WHAT BY THE STATE

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:19.481
REALISTICALLY BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:20.815
WITH THAT GROWTH.

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:22.584
SO THAT'S WHERE WE CAME UP WITH

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.186
THAT KIND OF THESE TARGETS I

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:25.487
THINK THE REASON WE REACH THEM

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:27.088
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE IS BECAUSE THE

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:28.156
ECONOMY JUST ENDED UP BEING A

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.724
LOT BETTER THAN WE THOUGHT IT

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:31.493
WAS -- THE

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.594
MINIMUM GUARANTEED GREW QUITE A

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.963
BIT PARTICULARLY IN FIFTEEN

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:36.064
SIXTEEN AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AS

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:37.232
YOU SEE ON THIS CHART.

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:39.167
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF BROUGHT US

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:41.670
TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY --

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:42.604
SO.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.306
WERE FINALLY WE'RE BACK TO WE'RE

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:45.073
ACTUALLY --

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.641
WE GOT BACK TO SEVEN EIGHT

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:48.677
LEVELS A FEW YEARS AGO AND NOW

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:49.678
WE STARTED TO PASSING THEM

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:50.912
BECAUSE THE ECONOMY HAS

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.180
CONTINUED TO GROW --

01:20:52.247 --> 01:20:53.615
BUT NOW I THINK JUST FOUR MONTHS

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.317
SHORT ABOUT LONGEST ECONOMIC

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:56.918
EXPANSION EVER AND SO THAT'S A

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.286
GIVEN US MORE ROOM TO INCREASE

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.455
FUNDING BEYOND JUST GETTING BACK

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:00.755
THIS OKAY.

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:02.524
BUT MY QUESTION WAS THESE

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.492
FUNDING TARGETS WORTHY GUIDING

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:05.961
BENCHMARKS --

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:08.029
BY WHICH WE MEASURE OUR PROGRESS

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:11.700
TOWARD THE GOAL THAT WE STATUS

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:13.535
IN.

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:14.135
THAT THESE TARGETS OF KIND OF

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:15.470
BEEN THE FOCUS OF OUR BUDGET

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:16.137
DELIBERATIONS THE GEFFEN LOCUSTS

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:18.707
AND AND AND THE PLANNING TOOL.

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:21.009
TO REACH THE GOAL THAT WE SET IN

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:21.676
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IT'S THE WAY

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:22.611
THAT DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN

01:21:22.677 --> 01:21:23.678
THINKING ABOUT THEIR BUDGETS

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:24.846
THEY BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOW

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.581
MUCH OF THIS SORT OF GAP IS

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:27.482
GOING TO BE CLOSED EACH YEAR

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:28.617
WHAT'S THE COST OF LIVING

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:30.518
ADJUSTMENT GOING TO BE.

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.020
THAT'S KIND OF BEEN.

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:32.621
HOW HOW DISTRICTS THINK ABOUT

01:21:32.687 --> 01:21:34.990
THEIR?

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:36.925
IN IN FACT IN YOUR REPORT YOU

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:38.526
YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THE STATE

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:41.963
REACHED THE LCF A FUNNY TARGET --

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:43.365
TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:44.799
SO CLEARLY WE'RE MEASURING OUR

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:46.835
PROGRESS BASED ON THE FUNDING

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.470
TARGETS THAT WE STAFF IS CORRECT

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:49.571
YEAH I THINK OF TRADE --

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:52.040
BUT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE FUNDING

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:54.276
TARGETS IS THAT CORRECT.

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.210
THAT'S CORRECT SO NOW WE'RE

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.845
WE'VE CREATED A STATE POLICY

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:58.313
THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDE

01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.447
A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:00.515
THOSE TARGETS.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:02.617
AND THAT'S KIND OF A LITTLE BIT

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:03.885
OF RETURN TO HOW THINGS WORKED

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:05.687
SAY TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:06.288
WHERE IT WAS JUST THE CURRENT

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:09.324
LEVEL ADJUSTED EACH YEAR.

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.659
SORRY YET BUT IT BUT THE THAT

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:11.960
THE JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:14.062
THE FUNDING TARGETS ONLY GOT US

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:17.966
BACK TO WHERE WE WERE --

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:20.035
IT IN --

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:20.502
SEVEN OH EIGHT WITH.

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:21.903
THE SOME COST OF OF OF LIVING

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.239
ADJUSTMENTS THEY GOT US BACK TO

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.106
ABOVE THAT LEVEL --

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:26.508
PARTLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:28.043
LEGISLATURE REALLY WANTED WE

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.544
WANTED TARGETS THAT WERE

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.112
SOMEWHAT AMBITIOUS AND WE TRY TO

01:22:31.179 --> 01:22:32.981
STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:33.715
WAS.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:35.050
PART OF WHAT WE WERE IT WHAT WE

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:36.117
COULD FIND WITHIN THE NEXT

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:37.519
COUPLE YEARS AND KIND OF WHERE

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:38.553
WE WANTED TO BE.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.654
AND THE TARGETS KIND OF

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:42.991
REFLECTED THAT KIND OF BALANCE

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:45.160
BETWEEN THOSE TWO OBJECTIVES.

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:47.329
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:48.897
MR O'DONNELL.

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:50.031
YEAH I I I THINK I I MAY WANT TO

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:51.766
DEFEND THE GOVERNOR HERE FOR A

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:52.701
SECOND --

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:53.501
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT THIS BODY

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:54.135
KEEPS DOING IT KEEPS DEFINING

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:55.537
THE PROBLEM BUT NOT SOLVING THE

01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:57.005
PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:58.406
EDUCATION FUNDING --

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.842
WHEN THE BUDGET IS IS IS?

01:23:00.909 --> 01:23:02.410
IT'S A TEAM EFFORT IT'S NOT JUST

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:03.845
ABOUT THE GOVERNOR IT'S ALSO

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:05.313
ABOUT THIS BODY.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.781
AND WE CAN FAULT THE PROPOSED

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:08.850
BUDGET BUT IN THE END.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.318
WE OWN THE APPROVED BUDGET.

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:12.420
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE COME

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:13.722

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.158
THINK.

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:17.759
IT TAKES MORE WILL FROM THIS

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:20.061
BODY. TO PUSH FOR MORE THAN.

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:22.564
NINETY EIGHT AND I THINK WE YOU

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.299
KNOW IT'S IT'S BEEN A MUTUAL FOR

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:25.767
EXERCISE WE'VE BEEN AWARE AND WE

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.001
WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE ALL SETTLE FOR

01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:28.436
THIS THIS NINETY EIGHT BEING THE

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:29.537
CEILING.

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:31.339
AS OPPOSED TO THE FLOOR.

01:23:31.406 --> 01:23:33.508
AND I THINK THIS YEAR I

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:34.909
HOPEFULLY THE POLITICAL WILL.

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:37.545
ANNA POLICY DESIRE WILL BE THERE

01:23:37.612 --> 01:23:39.881
TO GO WELL ABOVE PROPOSITION

01:23:39.948 --> 01:23:40.749
NINETY EIGHT WE NEED A STRONGER

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.150
COMMITMENT FROM THIS LEGISLATURE

AS WELL.

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:45.286
BUT AGAIN I THINK SOME OF THAT'S

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:46.521
US WE NEED TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:47.689
TO AND SEE WHAT OUR ROLE.

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:51.092

THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU I'LL

ALWAYS I WHAT MY COLLEAGUES.

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:58.600
TO SPEAK UP FIRST --

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.168
WITH THAT MISTER GALLAGHER

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:01.569
WELCOME TO SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:02.537
TWO BY THE WAY.

01:24:02.604 --> 01:24:03.972
GLAD TO BE HERE --

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:07.475
I I DIDN'T HAVE. TOO MUCH MORE

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.043
TO ADD IN THERE I JUST --

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:10.779
NO ONE IS.

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:12.113
I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS THE

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.448
DECLINE IN.

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:14.716
THE CLIENT ENROLLMENT DO WE HAVE

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:17.619
LIKE A REASONING FOR THAT WHILE

01:24:17.685 --> 01:24:18.787
WE'RE SEEN AS THE CLIENTS IN A

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:19.421
ROMAN RIGHT NOW.

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:20.722
SURE I CAN SPEAK TO THAT THE

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:21.956
BIGGEST FACTOR HAS BEEN AND A

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:23.191
DROP IN THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS IN

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:24.893
THE STATE A STARTING AROUND THE

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.261
TIME THE GREAT RECESSION BEGAN

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.396
THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS DROPPED

01:24:28.463 --> 01:24:29.898
THAT MAY NOT BE A BIG SURPRISE.

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:31.299
ABOUT WHAT WAS SURPRISING TO

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:32.600
SOME DEMOGRAPHERS IS THAT BIRTH

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:34.102
NEVER PICKED UP IN THE RECOVERY

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:36.304
STARTED AND SO EVERY YEAR THAT

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:38.339
GOES BY EACH COHORT OF INCOMING

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:39.574
STUDENTS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:40.975
THAN THE ONE AT YOUR PLACE AND

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:43.445
AND SO WITH THAT.

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:46.014
DECLINE WE THINK THAT NOT JUST

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.382
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS BUT

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:47.916
REALLY FOR THE FORESEEABLE

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:49.184
FUTURE.

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:50.785
REST ASSURED THE GALLAGHER

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:52.954
FAMILY YOU'RE DOING YOUR PART BY

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:56.724
AND WE HAVE DONE OUR PART OF THE

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:59.861
SIX KIDS RIGHT. FIVE FIVE AND

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.362
THEN THE OBVIOUS I THINK IT WAS

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:02.030
ALREADY KIND OF TALKED ABOUT BUT

01:25:02.096 --> 01:25:03.698
A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN I I

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.099
THINK I UNDERSTAND.

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:07.068
WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO

01:25:07.135 --> 01:25:08.236
DO HOWEVER?

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:09.871
WE KNOW THAT LIKE IF WE GET HIT

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.573
WITH A MILD RECESSION.

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:13.141
WE COULD HAVE A REAL BIG BUDGET

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.376
PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS AND I THINK

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.779
IF WE CUT A TIRE HANDS WITH BY

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:19.514
ELIMINATING THE TRUE UP.

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:20.815
YOU KNOW HAVING SOME OF THAT

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:22.450
FLEXIBILITY CERTAINLY WANT TO DO

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:23.485
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.186
EDUCATION HOLE EVEN WHEN WE GO

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:26.788
INTO --

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:27.956
TOUGHER TIMES BUT WE NEED TO

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.724
MAKE SURE THAT.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.359
WE HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:32.827
SO I MEAN I THINK WE SHOULD KIND

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:34.395
OF THINK THROUGH THAT.

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.297
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE EVEN

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:38.366
THE L. L. AS WARNED HEY.

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:40.635
A MILD RECESSION WE COULD HAVE

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:42.237
FORTY YOU KNOW WAS A FORTY

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:45.073
BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT --

01:25:45.139 --> 01:25:46.307
ON OUR HANDS SO.

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:47.408
I JUST THINK THAT SOMETHING TO

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:49.043
BE THINKING ABOUT AS WE AS WE

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:50.945
MOVE FORWARD AND IF WE MAKE ANY

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:53.014
CHANGES --

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:55.316
TO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR ME

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:55.950
I THINK WE HAVE TO KIND OF KEEP

01:25:56.017 --> 01:25:59.654
THAT IN MIND --

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:00.221
AND THEN LAW AND THEN I JUST

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:02.190
WANT.

01:26:02.257 --> 01:26:03.725
TO AND A BECAUSE I KNOW --

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.493
SIMON O'DONNELL IS REALLY WORKED

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:08.062
TRYING TO MAKE THAT

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:10.331
PRIORITIZATION AND AND SOME

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:11.966
WOMEN MARRIED TO DELUDED TO IT.

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.701
EQUALIZATION FOR SPECIAL

01:26:13.768 --> 01:26:15.837
EDUCATION FUNDING I THINK IT'S

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:17.338
GONNA BE A BIG ISSUE.

01:26:17.405 --> 01:26:19.140
THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AS WELL --

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:20.375
AND TRYING TO MAKE THAT A

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:22.343
PRIORITY.

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:23.945
AT SOME POINT TO OUR TO OUR

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.514
EDUCATION BUDGET AS WELL SO.

WRAP THIS UP SO I I APPRECIATE

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:37.358
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT --

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:38.726
PER PEOPLE FUNDING IS MISTER

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:40.895
MEDINA SAID OUR CLASS SIZES I

01:26:40.962 --> 01:26:43.131
THINK IT'S IT'S HARD IT'S APPLES

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:44.532
AND ORANGES NOT ALWAYS APPLES TO

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:46.134
APPLES ORANGES TO ORANGES BUT

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.469
THE BOTTOM LINE IS CALIFORNIA.

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:49.504
IS IN THE BOTTOM HALF.

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.506
IN PER PUPIL FUNDING AND CLASS

01:26:51.573 --> 01:26:54.208
SIZES AND SO REGARDLESS WHETHER

YOU LOOK AT OUR COST OF LIVING.

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:58.012
WE'RE STILL NOWHERE NEAR --

01:26:58.079 --> 01:27:00.648

FOR THEIR STUDENTS WITH SIMILAR

01:27:05.653 --> 01:27:07.789
DEMOGRAPHICS AND SO I THINK YOU

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:09.457

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:09.757

FROM THAT --

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.895

THESE DISTRICTS CAN'T AFFORD.

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:39.947

SO YOU KNOW.

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:05.373
IT EVENTUALLY IT LOOKS LIKE

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.276

HAPPENING HERE IN TOWN --

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:25.560
THAT SYNDICATE OF OF THAT BUT

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.595
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:29.063

IT'S HAPPENING I MEAN.

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:37.105
THE OTHER PART PART OF IT IS

01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:38.873
DECLINING ENROLLMENT WHICH WE WE

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.676
DISCUSSED EARLIER --

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:43.177
THE STATE YOU KNOW MOST

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.912
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE ARE ARE

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.714
IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT AS WELL

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:50.151
BUT A BIG PART OF IT IS ALSO YO.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.386
YO WE DISCUSS THE THE INCREASED

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:53.721
IN THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:55.523
IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.358
SERVICES AND AND THE COST OF

01:29:57.425 --> 01:29:59.393
THOSE SERVICES.

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.363
AS WELL AS JUST JUST IS JOE THE

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:05.299
THE COST INCREASES THAT YO THE

01:30:05.366 --> 01:30:07.034
INCREASE IN THE COST OF LIVING

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:08.703
THE INCREASING IN IN IN PENSION

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.204
COSTS AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:11.439

ALL CONTRIBUTING FROM FROM

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:20.515
DIFFERENT ANGLES AND EURO --

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:21.783
IN MY HEAD.

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:23.084

YOUR FORCES DATEABLE INVESTMENTS

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.388
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S VERY

01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:29.824
CRITICAL FOR FOR DISTRICTS GOING

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:30.892
FOR THAT I HOPE IN IN LOOKING AT

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:32.927
SO THE STRUCTURE OF NINETY EIGHT

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:36.597
AND THE THE STRUCTURE OF OF YOU

01:30:36.664 --> 01:30:37.431
KNOW THE STATE'S BUDGET GOING

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:39.333
FORWARD THAT YOU CONSIDER --

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.869
NOT JUST SORT OF THE STATE'S

01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:43.404
FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THE STATE

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:44.872

BUT ALSO WHAT WHAT.

01:30:49.443 --> 01:30:51.879
WHAT THAT DOES TO LOCAL AGENCIES

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:54.382
AND SCHOOL DISTRICT TEMPERATURE

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:57.618
WHERE IN THEIR THEIR ABILITY? TO

01:30:57.685 --> 01:30:59.053
TO TO REACTIVATE TO CHANGING

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.923
ECONOMIC AND FISCAL

01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:04.158
CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:45.559
WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:47.061
YET AND CERTAINLY THAT THAT

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:49.330
NEEDS TO BE ON ON THE RESOURCE

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:51.532
SIDE AND POTENTIAL.

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.401
ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF REVENUE

01:32:53.467 --> 01:32:55.236
BOTH FOR THE STATE AND ALSO

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.470
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS --

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:57.638
IT'S CURRENTLY --

01:32:57.705 --> 01:32:58.706
A CONVERSATION THAT THE

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:01.275
SUPERINTENDENT IS IS INTERESTED

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:03.477
IN IN BEGINNING TO HAVE WITH

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:04.912
WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND AND

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:09.917

AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR IN THE

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:16.590
STATE OF THIS OR I THINK THE

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:18.292
GOVERNOR'S MANSION THE OTHER.

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:20.695
OTHER IDEAS AS WELL --

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:23.197
THE THERE I I THINK WE WE NEED

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:25.499
TO THINK VERY VERY BROADLY NOT

01:33:25.566 --> 01:33:27.435
JUST [inaudible]

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:28.402
THE OLD.

01:33:28.469 --> 01:33:29.303
HAVEN'T STATE REVENUE IDEAS BUT

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:32.039
ALSO WAYS THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:33.774
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE HEALTH

01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:35.309
AND HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEM CAN

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:38.179
WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER. TO

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:39.213
TO TO BRING DOWN MORE FEDERAL

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.017
FUNDING --

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:45.353
YELLED --

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:47.021
SOURCES THAT MAY NOT BE FULLY

01:33:47.088 --> 01:33:48.956
UTILIZED AT THE MOMENT AT AT THE

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:50.891
LOCAL LEVEL SO I I THINK YOU

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.426
KNOW.

01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:52.860
WE WILL DO OUR THE

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:53.995
SUPERINTENDENT CERTAINLY

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:56.731
ADVOCATE THAT THAT WE AS A STATE

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:58.332
HAVE A DISCUSSION OF A BROAD

01:33:58.399 --> 01:34:01.268
DISCUSSION AROUND RESOURCES FOR

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:02.503
FOR EDUCATION AND REALLY

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:06.140
RESOURCES. FOR FOR CHILDREN IN

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:08.342
IN GENERAL.

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:10.277
THE DAILY I WANT.

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:10.978
TO JUMP IN ON WHAT SOME

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:11.679
DISTRICTS ARE.

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.781
GOING THROUGH RELATED TO THEIR

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:16.550
OBLIGATIONS THEIR CONTRACTS AND

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:17.118
HOW MUCH MONEY THE STATE HAS

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:17.985
GOING.

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.020
FOR YEAH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:20.521
TOO MUCH TO ADD TO WHAT THE

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:21.889
SUPERINTENDENT ON THE DEPARTMENT

01:34:21.956 --> 01:34:24.058
OF FINANCE ALREADY ADDED BUT I

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:24.658
THINK WE WOULD JUST REITERATE

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:25.292
ARE.

01:34:25.359 --> 01:34:26.427
KIND OF UNDERSTANDING AT THIS

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.596
POINT THAT IF ANYTHING THE

01:34:28.662 --> 01:34:30.264
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:31.832
MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER BY

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:34.235
MAY AND SO I THINK WE WANT TO

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:35.403

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:38.686
IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT SPECIAL

01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:40.120
EDUCATION IS AN AREA IN THE

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:41.555
STATE WHICH NEEDS SOME

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:42.890
ADDITIONAL FOCUS.

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:44.725
SO -- AND

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.527
I'M SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THE

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:47.394
QUESTION NOW --

01:37:47.461 --> 01:37:48.362
MIKE MIKE THE QUESTION IS --

01:37:48.429 --> 01:37:49.396
IT IS A CORRECT THAT THE

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:50.831
ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW IS ONLY

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:53.434
PROPOSING ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.869
ONLY FOR THE DISTRICTS SERVING

01:37:55.936 --> 01:37:59.974
LARGE -- THE

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.076
V. I. ON THAT THE THE DISTRICTS

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:03.644
WITHOUT WITHOUT --

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.846
HI UNDER TO GET A STUDENT COUNTS.

01:38:05.913 --> 01:38:06.947
YES THANK YOU YES THAT IS THE

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:08.415
WAY IT THAT THE FORMULA IS

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:09.984
DESIGNED FOR HIGH END DUPLICATED

01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:10.618
IN HIGH AA --

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:11.919
ABOVE AVERAGE SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.087
STUDENTS SO IT'S MORE OF A

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:14.922
TARGETED INVESTMENT WHERE WE

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:16.190
BELIEVE THERE'S HIGHER NEED --

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:18.325
AND HIGHER RISK OF BECOMING

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:20.694
SPECIAL EDUCATION IDENTIFIED BUT

01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:22.296
YOU KNOW MY MY CONCERN IS THAT

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:23.998
THERE ARE DISTRICTS --

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:25.599
THE THE VAST MAJORITY OF AT

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:27.067
LEAST IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF

01:38:27.134 --> 01:38:29.536
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE --

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:33.741
DATA THE FIGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:35.643
THEY THEY THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE

01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:38.045
THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:40.648
LOW INCOME FOSTER KIDS AND

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:42.850
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BUT

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:44.218
STILL THEY HAVE.

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.353
A HIGH POPULATION OF SPECIAL

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.022
EDUCATION STUDENTS.

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.690
THERE'S THERE'D THE OB

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.225
STRUGGLING ALSO YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:52.993
GOOD THEY'RE DEALING WITH THAT

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.462
SAME REALITY OF OF LARGER LARGER

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:58.732
PORTIONS OF THEIR GENERAL FUND --

01:38:58.799 --> 01:39:00.501
HAVING TO COVER THE SHORTFALL

01:39:00.567 --> 01:39:01.835
THAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:39:01.902 --> 01:39:03.637
SHORTFALL IN SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:39:03.704 --> 01:39:04.438
COSTS AND SO.

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:06.073
YEAH I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.075
THE GOVERNOR IS NOT RECOGNIZING

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:09.543
THE REALITY THAT.

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:11.278
TO THAT THE DISTRICTS WHO --

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:12.780
WITH THE LOWER UNTYPED ON

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:14.515
DUPLICATE STATE ACCOUNTS BUT

01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:16.650
STILL FACE --

01:39:16.717 --> 01:39:18.786
SPECIAL EDUCATION CHALLENGES WHY

01:39:18.852 --> 01:39:20.321
ARE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS

01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:22.056
NOT TRYING TO HELP THEM OUT ALSO.

01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:24.425
IT I AND IN THIS INVESTMENT IS

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:24.925
RELEASED.

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:28.195
AB TARGETED AND KIND OF

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:31.532
STRATEGIC REQUIRES ADDITIONAL

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:33.167
FOCUS -- THE

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:35.069
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IS

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:35.903
REALLY --

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:37.438
IT'S A FORMULA FOR ALL STUDENTS

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:38.572
GENERAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.007
EDUCATION TO THE EXTENT THE

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.241
SPECIAL EDUCATION NEED AT

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:42.509
STUDENT NEED SERVICES AND

01:39:42.576 --> 01:39:44.478
SUPPORTS THAT DRAW ON THE LOCAL

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:45.946
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:47.448
IT'S THEIR DOLLARS WELL SO I

01:39:47.514 --> 01:39:48.849
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:50.384
AND WE'VE SEEN TWENTY THREE

01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:51.318
BILLION DOLLAR INCREASES AND

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:52.753
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.655
SINCE SINCE INCEPTION.

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:55.656
SO ALL DISTRICT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:58.258
SEEN INCREASES IN FUNDING.

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.294
AND THAT SHOULD BE USED ON THEIR

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:01.562
SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AS

01:40:01.628 --> 01:40:02.429
WELL IBM BUT I YOU KNOW WANT TO

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:03.764
REMIND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:04.631
THAT -- YOU

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:05.899
KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WHILE WE'RE

01:40:05.966 --> 01:40:07.534
TALKING ABOUT --

01:40:07.601 --> 01:40:09.069
THE PER PEOPLE --

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:11.939
STUDENTS SPENDING GOING UP TO

01:40:12.005 --> 01:40:12.539
TWELVE THOUSAND PER STUDENT I

01:40:12.606 --> 01:40:13.841
KNOW THAT --

01:40:13.907 --> 01:40:15.109
THAT -- SOME

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:17.277
OF MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN IN IN

01:40:17.344 --> 01:40:19.446
MY DISTRICT ARE RECEIVING ON

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:22.516
AVERAGE ABOUT --

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:23.050
EIGHT THOUSAND FUNDING PER

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:26.487
STUDENT AND SO WHILE THE BE --

01:40:26.553 --> 01:40:29.022
THE THE THE INCREASES HAVE HAVE

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:32.393
BEEN THE MOST DRAMATIC WITH THE

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:32.960
WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE

01:40:33.026 --> 01:40:36.964

ALSO ALL DISTRICTS ARE ARE ARE

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:40.167
ARE STRUGGLING AND AND SO IT'S

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:42.069
IT'S NOT IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:42.870
THAT.

01:40:42.936 --> 01:40:44.138

SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FUNDING AND I

01:40:48.942 --> 01:40:50.844
I WOULD JUST ASK THE GOVERNOR'S

01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:52.179
OFFICE -- TO

01:40:52.246 --> 01:40:53.480
TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:54.648
THAT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:56.617
ARE STRUGGLING WITH --

01:40:56.683 --> 01:40:58.419
DRAMATICALLY INCREASING SPECIAL

01:40:58.485 --> 01:40:59.920
EDUCATION COSTS WE'VE HEARD

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:01.054
THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL AND WE

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:04.358
RECOGNIZE THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:06.460
TAKE THOSE CONCERNS BACK WITH US.

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:07.795
THANK YOU I WENT TO BEFORE WE GO

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:10.164

SUPERINTENDENTS REPRESENTATIVE.

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:13.066
TALK ABOUTTHE EARLY EDUCATION

01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:14.301
COMPONENT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIG

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:16.003
HEARING ABOUT THIS A FEW WEEKS

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:18.605
AND WE HAD A SPECIAL HEARING A

01:41:18.672 --> 01:41:20.407
FEW WEEKS AGO ON ON PRE K. FOR

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:21.675
ALL AND WHAT IT WOULD TAKE YOUR

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:22.509
CALIFORNIA SO.

01:41:22.576 --> 01:41:23.644
OBVIOUSLY IT I'M A BIG BELIEVER

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:27.014
THAT C. MATTERS AND CERTAINLY

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.315
PLEASED TO SEE THAT.

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:29.349
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET --

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:31.385
STEPPING UP TO INVEST IN OUR

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:33.620
YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND WANTED TO

01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:35.322
TO REALLY ASK THE LA ABOUT YOUR

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:36.657
RECOMMENDATION.

01:41:36.723 --> 01:41:38.459
THAT AS FAR AS THAT THE PRE K.

FOR ALL EXPANSION YOU.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.662
YOU -- MAYBE.

01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:43.630
SUGGEST THAT WE TAKE A STEP BACK

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:44.565
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME COME

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:46.967
CAPACITY ISSUES AND SO LOGISTICS

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:47.968
ISSUES SO.

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:49.937
THE FLIP SIDE IS MAYBE WE SHOULD

01:41:50.003 --> 01:41:52.005
LOOK AT THOSE CAPACITY ISSUES

01:41:52.072 --> 01:41:57.144
AND FACILITIES AND WORK FORCE --

01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:58.946
AS A WAY TO TURN TO WRAP UP AS

01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:00.948
OPPOSED TO NOT RAMP UP BECAUSE

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:02.583
WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED IT KIND OF

01:42:02.649 --> 01:42:03.584
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN.

01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:06.553
SO DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IN

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.088
YOUR ANALYSIS.

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:09.122
YES WE WE DID THINK ABOUT THAT

01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:10.390
SO THE GOVERNOR'S PERHAPS A

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:12.092
PROPOSAL FOR WORK FORCE AND

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.461
FACILITY --

01:42:14.528 --> 01:42:15.796
FACILITY GRANTS OF BOOK.

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:17.064
BUT AS WE LOOKED AT THOSE

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.365
SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WE HAD

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:19.700
CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:21.101
TARGETING ON THOSE PER THE

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:22.369
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO TARGET

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:23.871
THOSE PROPOSALS FOR SPECIFIC

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:25.672
ISSUES AND ALL PROVIDE ONE

01:42:25.739 --> 01:42:26.874
EXAMPLE HERE --

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:28.609
THE FOR THE THE FUNDING THAT'S

01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:29.443
PROVIDED FOR WORKFORCE

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:34.248
DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICALLY --

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:35.115
I THINK WE ARE WE THINK THAT THE

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:37.251
STATE LACKS SOME DATA ON

01:42:37.317 --> 01:42:38.619
WORKFORCE UP ON SOME BASIC DATA

01:42:38.685 --> 01:42:39.720
ON WORKFORCE ISSUES SUCH AS THE

01:42:39.786 --> 01:42:41.054
NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN THE STATE

01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:42.356
OR THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN

01:42:42.422 --> 01:42:43.924
SPECIFIC REGIONS --

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.225
AND IT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:47.694
FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE FUNDS --

01:42:47.761 --> 01:42:49.663
SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE THE

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:52.432
NUMBER OF TEACHERS --

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:53.734
IN THE WORK FORCE.

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.302
WITHOUT HAVING A SET TARGET GOT

01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:56.537
A NUMBER ABOUT THE SLOTS SO YOU

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:58.438
RECOMMEND NOT INCREASING.

01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:00.240
THE EN THOUSAND FEET WE DO

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:04.111
WELCOME TWO THOUSAND FIVE

01:43:04.177 --> 01:43:05.712
HUNDRED A NEW SLOT INCREASES AND

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:06.780
ALSO STARTING THOSE INCREASES

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.282
MID YEAR I'M PARTICULARLY

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:10.050
BECAUSE THE SLIGHT INCREASE THE

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:11.618
GOVERNOR PROPOSES --

01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:13.120
IS A TEN THOUSAND INCREASE WHICH

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:15.222
IS ABOUT 40% OF THE NON ELLIE A

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:17.157
FULL DAY SLOTS OVER ONE YEAR AND

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:18.191
WE THINK THAT MIGHT BE QUITE

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:19.593
CHALLENGING.

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:20.928
I'M GIVEN SOME LOGISTICAL TERM --

01:43:20.994 --> 01:43:23.597
CAN LOGISTICAL CONCERNS ON THE

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:25.198
ADMINISTRATION SIDE AS WELL ON

01:43:25.265 --> 01:43:28.235
AS A PROVIDER SITES A LOCALLY AT

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:32.306
THE STATE LEVEL.

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:34.141
OKAY WE OBVIOUSLY DISAGREE THAT

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:35.275
THAT'S WHY WE'LL HAVE OUR

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:36.777
HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE THE

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:38.745
SPRING TO IRON THIS OUT SO WITH

01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:40.681
THAT LET'S.

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:42.349
PROCEED WITH OUR NEXT --

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:43.383
SECTION OF THE AGENDA AND

01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:44.918
THEY'LL GET TO PUBLIC COMMENTS

01:43:44.985 --> 01:43:46.954
REALLY TO INVITE UP LUPITA

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.422
CORTEZ AKULA.

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:48.989

IN K. TWELVE THE WHATEVER A

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:40.466
RANKING WE HAVE --

02:05:40.532 --> 02:05:42.635
IT IS -- IT

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:45.504

02:05:55.814 --> 02:05:57.416
TRANSPARENCY ISSUE.

02:06:00.786 --> 02:06:01.954
GENERATED.

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:04.056

MADE TO DO SO --

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:13.799
WE BELIEVE THAT OF TRANSPARENCY

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:15.334
IS REALLY HAMPERING OUR

02:06:15.401 --> 02:06:17.903

A GOOD MORNING MUNCIE SALON KIA

02:09:17.716 --> 02:09:19.785
ON BEHALF OF THE HIGH SCHOOL

02:09:19.852 --> 02:09:21.453
STUDENT ADVOCATES FROM IRVINE

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.855
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

02:09:22.921 --> 02:09:24.423
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE

02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:26.091
ON THE ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCES

02:09:26.158 --> 02:09:28.360
THAT ARE DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY

02:09:28.427 --> 02:09:29.394
YOUR POLICIES.

02:09:29.461 --> 02:09:32.097
SO IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE --

02:09:32.164 --> 02:09:33.599
CLASS SIZES HAVE BEEN A BIG

02:09:33.665 --> 02:09:36.568
ISSUE OUR SCHOOL AND OUR EIGHTY

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:38.604
COST SIZE RANGE FROM THIRTY NINE

02:09:38.670 --> 02:09:40.339
TO FORTY STUDENTS AND AS YOU CAN

02:09:40.405 --> 02:09:41.740
SEE THAT IS A VERY LARGE AMOUNT.

02:09:41.807 --> 02:09:43.575
AND IN GENERAL WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:09:43.642 --> 02:09:46.545
SEE A LOT OF OTHER STUDENTS

02:09:46.612 --> 02:09:48.113
SERVICES THAT AREN'T PROPERLY

02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:50.382
FUNDED FOR INCLUDING MENTAL

02:09:50.449 --> 02:09:52.184
HEALTH SERVICES AND COUNCILLORS --

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:53.852
RECENTLY WE HAD A BIG TRAUMA AT

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.154
OUR SCHOOL AND WE DID NOT HAVE

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:56.522
ENOUGH GUIDANCE COUNSELORS TO

02:09:56.588 --> 02:09:58.157
ACCOUNT FOR THAT SITUATION.

02:09:58.223 --> 02:09:59.791
AND IN ADDITION --

02:09:59.858 --> 02:10:03.228
THE FUNDING FOR THIS WOULD BE IT --

02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:04.763
GREATLY HELPED THROUGH --

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:07.332
CFF UNFORTUNATELY IRVINE IS

02:10:07.399 --> 02:10:10.802
FACED WITH THE PROBLEM THAT THE

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:12.104
FORMULA --

02:10:12.171 --> 02:10:12.905
IS ACTUALLY LEAVING SO UNDER

02:10:12.971 --> 02:10:14.907
FUNDING DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE

02:10:14.973 --> 02:10:16.675
DO NOT HELD UP ADEQUATE NUMBER

02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:19.077
OF LOW INCOME AND ENGLISH

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:20.812
LEARNER STUDENTS AND DOES NOT

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:22.581
MEET THE PERCENTAGE THAT LEADS

02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:25.250
TO ON THE PROPER CONCENTRATION

02:10:25.317 --> 02:10:26.518
FUNDING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN --

02:10:26.585 --> 02:10:28.187
VERY BENEFICIAL FOR OUR SCHOOL

02:10:28.253 --> 02:10:30.656
DISTRICT SO WE ALSO LIKE TO

02:10:30.722 --> 02:10:32.791
FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT --

02:10:32.858 --> 02:10:33.859
PROBABLY NINETY EIGHT IS

02:10:33.926 --> 02:10:35.661
DEFINITELY JUST THE MINIMUM AND

02:10:35.727 --> 02:10:37.129
THOUGHT WE SHOULD NOT CONSIDER

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:38.030
THE CEILING.

02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:40.666
OF WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE --

02:10:40.732 --> 02:10:41.967
BETTER FUNDING IN THE FUTURE AND

02:10:42.034 --> 02:10:44.303
WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU.

02:10:44.369 --> 02:10:47.105

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:54.880

02:10:54.947 --> 02:10:56.648
BEGIN DEVELOPMENT OF A

02:10:56.715 --> 02:10:58.050
LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM.

02:10:58.116 --> 02:11:00.085
THAT FOLLOWS STUDENTS FROM EARLY

02:11:00.152 --> 02:11:01.820
AT THROUGH THE WORK FORCE --

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:03.522
WITHOUT SUCH A SYSTEM WE REALLY

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:05.991
ARE UNABLE TO ANSWER CRITICAL.

02:11:06.058 --> 02:11:08.227
QUESTIONS TO STUDENT PROGRESSION

02:11:08.293 --> 02:11:09.695
AND OUTCOMES FOR INSTANCE WERE

02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:10.896

THEY TAKE TO COMPLETE AND HOW DO

02:11:17.869 --> 02:11:19.338
THEY USE THEIR FINANCIAL AID --

SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:21.807
CONTINUED DISCUSSION ON THIS I

02:11:21.873 --> 02:11:23.508
WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO ENSURE

02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:25.611
THAT A SYSTEM IS CENTRALIZED

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:27.079
INDEPENDENT.

02:11:27.145 --> 02:11:29.281

I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE

02:11:42.694 --> 02:11:43.929
SPOKEN TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:11:43.996 --> 02:11:45.697
AND I'LL JUST TAKE OFF A COUPLE

02:11:45.764 --> 02:11:47.332

HIM FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

02:11:57.142 --> 02:11:58.810
AND WITH YOURSELVES ONE OF THE

02:11:58.877 --> 02:12:00.045
THINGS I WANTED TO MENTION WAS A

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:02.047
LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM THAT

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:02.748
WAS MENTIONED.

02:12:02.814 --> 02:12:03.382
A LAKE --

02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:05.484
ALREADY HAS A SYSTEM CONNECTING

02:12:05.550 --> 02:12:07.052
OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:12.691
ALREADY TAKEN THAT CHALLENGE ON

02:12:12.758 --> 02:12:13.925
SO WE REALLY WANT TO BE A PART

02:12:13.992 --> 02:12:15.160
OF THE DISCUSSION.

02:12:15.227 --> 02:12:16.295
ANOTHER THING WE'VE DONE IS

02:12:16.361 --> 02:12:17.963
WE'VE CREATED AN EDUCATIONAL

02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:20.232

ARE FOSTER AND HOMELESS YOUTH.

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:24.503
AND THAT ALLOWS ALL OF THE

02:12:24.569 --> 02:12:25.437
EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:27.906
ABLE TO OBTAIN RECORDS AND GET

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:29.308

02:12:29.374 --> 02:12:30.976
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTY.

02:12:31.043 --> 02:12:32.344
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

FOR US AND WE'D LIKE TO WORK

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:45.324
WITH OTHERS ON THAT.

02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:46.291
ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO POINT

02:12:46.358 --> 02:12:48.560

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:49.695

THIS YEAR WE HAVE THIRTY FIVE

SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT WE

02:13:12.784 --> 02:13:13.885
THINK THE FUNDING IS VERY

02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:15.120

02:14:51.416 --> 02:14:53.318
OUT LIKE MANY OF THE CONCERNS

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:54.719
RAISED BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS

02:14:54.786 --> 02:14:56.087
ESPECIALLY --

02:14:56.154 --> 02:14:58.290
MEMBER MARTUCCI AND THE MEDINA

02:14:58.356 --> 02:14:59.958
AND O'DONNELL --

02:15:00.025 --> 02:15:00.692
WHAT WE THINK THERE IS A

02:15:00.759 --> 02:15:02.627
DIFFERENT WAY TO PUT THESE FUNDS

02:15:02.694 --> 02:15:03.895
OUT WE KNOW THAT THE NEED IS

02:15:03.962 --> 02:15:05.063
STATEWIDE --

02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:06.298
THAT IS WHY FOR YEARS WE HAVE

02:15:06.364 --> 02:15:09.234
ADVOCATED FOR INCREASING FUNDING

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:10.936
AFTER THE EXISTING SPECIAL

02:15:11.002 --> 02:15:13.004
EDUCATION FORMULA FOR STUDENTS

02:15:13.071 --> 02:15:14.673
WITH DISABILITIES TO EQUALIZE

02:15:14.739 --> 02:15:15.974
THOSE FUNDING RATES --

02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:17.709
TO PROVIDE STATE FUNDS FOR

02:15:17.776 --> 02:15:19.711
PRESCHOOLERS WITH DISABILITIES --

02:15:19.778 --> 02:15:21.012
AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

02:15:21.079 --> 02:15:23.114
FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WITH THE

02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:24.783
MOST SEVERE DISABILITIES WE HAVE

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:26.151
TO ADD NOTES THAT THE STATE

02:15:26.218 --> 02:15:28.019
PROVIDES ZERO RESOURCES FOR

02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:29.421
PRESCHOOLERS WITH DISABILITIES

02:15:29.488 --> 02:15:30.355
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:15:30.422 --> 02:15:31.823
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US

02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:32.791
TO INVEST IN --

02:15:32.858 --> 02:15:34.292
AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS

02:15:34.359 --> 02:15:37.262
PART OF THE CONVERSATION THIS

02:15:37.329 --> 02:15:37.863
YEAR AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO

02:15:37.929 --> 02:15:38.864
IT.
