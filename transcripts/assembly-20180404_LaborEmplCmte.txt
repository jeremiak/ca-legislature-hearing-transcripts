A GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT. WE HAVE TWO BILLS TO BE HEARD TODAY. LAST THE SERGEANTS TO PLEASE CALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM. UNTIL WE DO WE WILL ACT AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. IT WILL HERE. THE BILLS THAT WE HAVE A BEFORE US IN WILL ALSO ASK. I IF THE SERGEANTS WOULD REACH OUT. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUBBY ARROWS OFFICE. SO THAT. HOW THE SENATE MEMBER MIGHT PRESENT? IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA WHO IS PRESENT. TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY THREE BUT WE ARE READY SIR WHENEVER YOU ARE THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S SHARE OF THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY THREE TODAY. AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REPORT TO CAL OSHA INSTANCES OF ELEVATED LEVELS OF LEAD AND WORKERS BLOOD. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE ANY FINES AND CITATIONS FROM INSPECTIONS BY CAL OSHA TO BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AS WE ALL KNOW OF THAT COULD HAVE PROFOUND AND PERMANENT ADVERSE HEALTH AFFECTS BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND AT VERY HIGH LEVELS LEAD POISONING CAN BE FATAL. ACCORDING TO THE CDC NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD LEVELS EXIST. DATA DERIVED FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BUT LED DIRECTLY HAS REVEALED THAT EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE HUNDREDS. AND PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WHO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF LEAD IN THEIR BLOOD. ONCE NOTIFIED THE PROBLEM BY THE CDP H. CAL OSHA IS RESPONSIBLE FOLLOWING UP WITH THESE CASES HOWEVER THERE'S OFTEN A DISCONNECT ABOUT WARNING THE AFFECTED WORKERS OR ADDRESSING THE EXPOSURE PROBLEM AT THE WORK SITE. EVEN AND EVEN WHEN EMPLOYERS REPORT HIDE LEAD BUT THE BLOOD LEVELS TO CDP H.. ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OF THE LACK OF ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT IS THE EXCITED BATTERY RECYCLING CLINTON VERNON WHICH WAS ALLOWED TO OPERATE YOUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND EMIT TOXIC POLLUTION INTO LOCAL ENVIRONMENT FOR OVER THREE DECADES. CAL OSHA PERFORMED LET INSPECTION UP EXCITE PLANT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND CPD H. WAS AWARE OF NUMEROUS LEAD POISONED WORKERS. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT THE PLANT WAS PERMANENTLY CLOSED BUT ORDER OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. TODAY WE KNOW THAT THOUSANDS OF HOMES NEAR EXCITE HAD HAVE UNSAFE LEVELS OF LEAD IN THE SOIL. CHILDREN OF THE PLAN HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF LEAD IN THEIR BLOOD. THAN THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN EXPOSED TO. THIS VILLAGE RIGHT WAY NOT ONLY HURTS FUTURE AND PRESENT WORKERS BUT THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE ALSO BELIEVE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY THOSE ELEVATED LEAD OF MY ELDERLY LET PLANTS LIKE EXCITED UNFORTUNATELY IT APPEARS THAT MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION BY STATE AGENCIES. COULD HAVE RESOLVED THE ISSUE MORE RAPIDLY. THEREBY SAVING HUNDREDS OF WORKERS SOME EXPOSURE TO THIS TOXIC METAL. AB TWENTY NINE SKIPPY WOULD IMPROVE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE MADE AWARE OF AND HANDLE CASES OF LEAD POISONING AMONGST WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WOULD HELP PREVENT REPEATED INCIDENTS OF LEAD POISONING IN WORKPLACES. UP I HAVE WITH ME TODAY IF IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR OF AS MY WITNESSES BILL I YOU'D BUT THE CONFERENCE RECOVERING DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR ABOUT NO WORKING GROUP. SPONSOR THE BILL AS WELL AS JOE RUBIN WHOSE. AN EMMY AWARD WINNING A BASKET WHERE THAT THE BILL WILL. HAVE FURTHER I INTRODUCTION OF. THANK YOU SOME NUMBER FIRST WITNESS WHY AM BILL ALLEY รณ WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION WE'RE PLEASED THAT MISTER KALRA WANTED TO GET INVOLVED. WE WORK ON TOXICS IN YOUR FOOD YOUR WATER AT THE WORKPLACE AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. A LETTUCE KIND OF THE TENSION OF THAT THE NATION AND THIS LEGISLATURE AND I'M MAJOR WAY THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH THE FLINT MICHIGAN PROBLEM. AND THEN WITH OUR EXIDE DISASTER IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA. LAST YEAR THERE WERE A COUPLE BILLS ON BETTER TESTING OF LEAD IN SCHOOL FOR DRINKING WATER SAFETY THIS YEAR THERE ARE FOUR MORE BILLS ABOUT LET TESTING IN CHILDREN PLUS THIS BILL ON LET WORKERS. IN ADDITION A PACKAGE OF SIX BILLS RESPONDING TO AN INITIATIVE ABOUT LEAD IN PAINT. SO LET IS A BIG ISSUE AND IT'S. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA SAID THERE'S NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD BOTH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN THE CDC SAY THAT. BOB JOE RUBIN WHAT WILL AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS WILL GO AFTER ME HE'S GONNA TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT US IS EXPERIENCE FIGURING OUT HOW. A LOCAL GUN RANGE A COULD GO FOR YEARS EXPOSING NEIGHBORS AND THEY WORKERS THERE TO HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD AND HE GOT ME INTERESTED IN THAT STORY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. BUT WORKERS AND PARDON ME ANALOGY ARE LIKE THE CANARIES IN THE COAL MINE. BUT THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS BEING AFFECTED BUT IF THEY'RE GETTING HIGH BLOOD LEVELS WE KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG AT THAT WORK SITE AND THEY CAN ALSO BRING THE BLOOD THE LEAD HOME. HAS DUST ON THEIR SHOES SO LITTLE CHILDREN GET EXPOSED TO AND CLEARLY AS MISTER RUBIN STORY. SUPPOSE THERE ARE GAPS IN LAPSES IN THE WAY WE OF RESPOND TO HIGH BLOOD BLOOD LEVELS THAT ARE REPORTED. I WANTED JUST BRIEFLY MENTION A COUPLE THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION IS RAISED IN THE LAST WEEK ONE IS THEY SAY THAT THIS BILL COULD. RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PRIVACY IN TERMS OF HIP OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS THE BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. AS IT RELATES TO HIPPA AND DISCLOSURE ON THAT. IF THEY SAY READ DIRAC'S THE CAL OSHA STAFF IMPLYING THAT THEY'LL BE THINGS THAT WILL BE MESSED WE THINK THE CALLUSES STAFF DOES A GREAT JOB IT SAFETY INSPECTIONS AND SPECIALLY IF THERE'S CRANES AND. DOORWAYS THINGS LIKE THAT WE LOOKED AT THE RECORDS THEY ISSUE FINES ENFORCEMENT. BUT ON LEAD THEY SEEMED OF FALLEN DOWN ON THE JOB SOMEWHAT AND THAT'S WHAT AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY THREE IS ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. YEAH I. PLEASURE TO BE HERE. I USUALLY COVER THESE KIND OF MEETINGS AND THE I GUESS IT UP AT SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OF. THE IMPACT OF LEAD THAT I'M HERE FOR FREE EFFENDI TODAY TALKING ABOUT HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN THE STORY AND WHAT WHAT KIND OF THE OVERALL STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING WORKERS. BUT YET MY NAME'S JOEL RUBIN AND I'M AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER. WORK FOR CAPITAL IN MAINE A PUBLICATION. REPORT FOR NPR AND AND OTHER OTHER PLACES. AND AND I IT'S I STARTED AS BILL MENTIONED I STARTED LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE OF A CONTAMINATED GUN RANGE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS CALLED THE MANGAN GUN RANGE AND. THE. THE RANGE CONTENT WITH BADLY CAN CAN LIVE INSIDE HUNDREDS OF TIMES ABOUT FEDERAL LEVELS. AND ALSO OUTSIDE THE FACILITY IN THE PARK AND IN NEIGHBORING HOMES WAS ALSO QUITE CONTAMINATED. AND I STARTED TO LOOK IN THIS STORY ONE OF THINGS THAT I LEARNED WAS THAT. YEARS BEFORE A CLOSED SYSTEM LIKE THIRTEEN YEARS PRIOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BECAME AWARE OF. VERY SERIOUS LEAD POISONING PROBLEMS INCLUDING AN INCREDIBLY LET PUTTING WORKER WHO SUBSEQUENTLY ACTUALLY DIED. ON THE MOST LIKELY FROM THE FROM LEAD POISONING IT IMPACTS I AM AND WHAT I FOUND JUST SURPRISING WAS THAT. THE. CITY P. H.. DIDN'T INFORM CALLOSUM THAT THIS WORKER HAD. IT OUT OF A POTENTIALLY DEADLY LEVEL OF OF OF LEAD POISONING AND THE REASON I THINK THEY SAID THEY. DIDN'T DO THAT WAS BECAUSE. THEY PREFER TO WORK WITH EMPLOYERS AND ONLY AS A LAST RESORT WOULD. INFORMED CAL OSHA OF THE SITUATION. AND SO THAT JUST YOU KNOW EITHER SO MANY STORIES AS YOU AS IF YOU FOLKS NOW. OUT I TO LOOK AT THAT JUST STRUCK ME IT'S JUSTIN SOUND RIGHT SO I STARTED LOOKING INTO IT. AND WITH THE HELP OF THE US C. I. ANNENBERG CENTER ON ON ON ON A ON HEALTH REPORTING. I DID OF EXTENSIVE PUBLIC RECORD SEARCH AND LOOK AT THE SITUATION WITH EXCITE YOU VERY FAMILIAR WITH EXCITE HIM SURE ON THAT THE LEGISLATURE TWO THOUSAND IT'S AND SIXTEEN. APPROPRIATED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO CLEAN UP THAT THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND THERE BE SOMETHING LIKE TEN THOUSAND HOMES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. I'M WITH UNSAFE LEVELS OF LEAD. AND SO. I'M I KNEW THAT WAS GONNA BE BAD I MEAN THAT THERE HAD TO BE SITUATIONS INSIDE THE PLANT BUT I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR WHAT WE ACTUALLY FOUND. WHICH WAS THAT BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN THE PLANT CLOSED CD P. H. WAS AWARE OF. OVER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED CASES OF. BOB DOUBLE OF LOW BLOOD LEAD TESTS WHICH WERE BASICALLY LEAD POISONED WORKERS WITH A VERY SERIOUS LEVEL OF OF OF LEAD IN THEIR FIGHT. OVER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER AND DURING THIS TIME. CALOSOMA KID ONE INSPECTION WHERE THEY FIND THAT EXCITE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. AND SO. THAT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST REALLY STRIKING AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WAS YOU KNOW WE FELT WE HAD TO REPORT OF COURSE. AND. WHAT WE ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE PROBABLY CALIFORNIA'S REALLY A SYSTEMIC ONE? I'M BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE ONE HAND YOU HAVE AN AGENCY COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION ANNA ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE ONE THAT'S. IF FORCING LABOR LAWS AND THERE'S ZERO CLARITY AS TO WHEN THAT INFORMATION MUST BE SHARED. IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW BASS WITH LIKE A BROKEN GAME OF TELEPHONE. AND. WHETHER THE SURPRISING THINGS THAT I FOUND I THINK WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. IS THAT THIS ISN'T THE CASE EVERY EVERYWHERE ON THE SAME YEAR THE CAL OSHA FINED EXCITE. TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. I. THE ANOTHER EXIDE BATTERIES LIKELY PLAN IN FORT SMITH ARKANSAS WAS FINE SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HAVING THE SAME KIND OF HIGH LEVEL THAT LEVELS OF LEAD AT THAT PLANT. SO WHY WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. HERE'S THE HERE'S THAT THE KEY DIFFERENCE ARKANSAS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT OTHER STATES HAS CLEARED LAWS WHICH STATE THAT ANY TIME WORKERS HAVE THAT TWENTY FIVE. MICROGRAMS OR HIGHER AYE LEVEL OF OF OF LEAD IN THEIR BLOOD WHICH IS THE SAME LEVEL AS AS ASSEMBLYMAN KALRA HAS IN HIS IN HIS BILL. I'M THAT DEALT THOSE THEN I'M QUOTING HERE I'M IN THE WORK THAT DOES. SHALL BE CONSIDERED HIGH GRAVITY SERIOUS AND MUST BE HANDLED BY INSPECTION I REPEAT MUST BE HANDLED BY INSPECTION YET AT EXCITE WE HAD THESE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED WORKERS. WHO HAD THIS LEVEL AND ONE INSPECTION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT? AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR OF FINES SO THIS JUST IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A KIND OF. DISCONNECT BETWEEN THESE AGENCIES ATTEMPT OF GETTING TOGETHER. AND MAKING SURE THAT THIS THIS THIS IS REALLY. REGULATED I'M. I JUST WANNA CLOSE BY SAYING. YOU KNOW MY ROLES INVESTIGATION THAT JOURNALISTS IS TO TRY AND EXPOSE PROBLEMS AND EXPLAIN COMPLEX STORIES. IT'S NOT RIGHT LOS. AT BUT I HAVE GOTTEN A LEAD PUT HIM WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES DURING THIS INVESTIGATION. AND I CAN TELL YOU I'M HAPPY IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TO GO WITH SOME DETAILS THAT LEAD POISONING IN ADULTS IS VERY SERIOUS. IT IT'S A CLEARLY THE SYSTEM AS PRESENTLY CONSTRUCTED IN CALIFORNIA. HAS FAILED THEM. I'M AND THESE WORKERS DESERVE THE CALIFORNIA'S BATH WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING THEM. LIKE YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU OR ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS RENEE BAYARDO ES HERE YOU CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT FROM BROWN INVESTMENT HERE ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS EIGHTEEN YEAR O. UTILITY WORKERS MACHINISTS LONGSHOREMEN IPT YOU LOCAL TWENTY ONE IN ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS OF CALIFORNIA WEIRD DRIVE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE. IS THEIR OPPOSITION TODAY. PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MARTY FISHER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AND WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ANOTHER AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO DICTATE THE PRIORITIES OF CAL OF CALLOSUM. AND A CLEAR CONDITION THAT DOES NOT VIOLATE ANY LAW AS AN ALLEGE SERIOUS VIOLATION OF A CAL OSHA REGULATION. WHETHER THERE ISN'T A REGULATION THAT EXISTS WITH THIS OF VIOLATION AND. A AND THEREFORE CAN'T BE CITED SO NO CITATION CAN BE ISSUED FOR A BLOOD LEAD LEVEL. OF ANY. OF ANY LEVEL. SO ESSENTIALLY THE BILL DIRECTS CALIPHATE TO ENFORCE A CONDITION THAT'S NOT A VIOLATION OF ANY LAW BUT TO TREATED AS SUCH. KELLER HAS LIMITED RESOURCES GRANTED THEY DO A GREAT JOB MORE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY DO. BUT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF REPORTED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS THAT EXCEED TWENTY. MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER AND THIS INFORMATION CAME FROM THE AUTHORS OFFICE. IF COLLEGES REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE ALL THESE ELEVATED. BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. THEN THIS COULD ADD ANOTHER SIX OR IT MAY BE EIGHT HUNDRED. INVESTIGATIONS AND INSPECTIONS TO CALIFORNIA LAW THAT MUST BE CONDUCTED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. THESE ARE THE INSPECTIONS AT A RESERVE FOR ONLY THE MOST SERIOUS AN IMMINENT WORKPLACE HAZARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE. A KEPT OUT OF HARM'S WAY SO THIS THIS COULD CERTAINLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT CALLUSES WORKLOAD. WE BELIEVE THAT IF A NEW REGULATION IS WARRANTED OR SUGGESTED ARE THAT WE NEED TO ESTABLISH NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR BLOOD LEAD LEVELS ARE FOR THE MONITORING OF BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. AND WE SHOULD DO IT THROUGH ESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. THROUGH THE RULE MAKING PROCESS IN WHICH WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE A THROUGH CAL OSHA. ANNA KELLER HAS THIS OF STATUTORY EXCLUSIVE STATUTORY JURISDICTION OVER WORKPLACE SAFETY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT ENFORCEMENT OF WORKPLACE SAFETY RULES. WE BELIEVE THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL IS UNPRECEDENTED NO AGENCIES SHOULD DIRECT QALISYA TO ALLEGED VIOLATION WHERE NONE EXISTS. OR TO DIVERT OR SKEW THEIR PRIORITIES WERE IMMINENT HAZARDS. SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU. AT OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. HELLO I FOUND THOSE WITH THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO POSED. AND LAGGED AND ABOUT HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ARE DISADVANTAGED SOME HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING THAT ON OPPOSITION. A SCENE NINE WILL TURN TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS WITH ANY QUESTION. IT MISTER JONES SAWYER ARM. THEY THE OPPOSITION ARM ACOUSTIC THEIR CLAIM IS. IF THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM. DON'T FIX IT UNLESS. PROVEN BROKEN UNLESS WE HAVE. LEGISLATION HAS SAID THAT BROKEN OR WE ESTABLISHED NEW CRITERIA. I'M OF THE OPINION. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT. UNTIL SOMEBODY DIES AT A LOWER LEVEL. LET PUT POISONING BEFORE WE GET INVOLVED. ON BY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH OTHERS KIN CAN MAKE THAT DETERMINATION SO CAN COLLECT CLARIFY OR MAYBE THEY NEED TO COME BACK AND CLARIFY I IS IT IS ABOUT. US CREATED IN THE LAW TO ESTABLISH A NEW LEVEL OR IS IT. OR IS IT MORE OF WAIT UNTIL SOMEBODY GETS SICK. AND THEN WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND CREATE A LAW COULD THIS SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE MORE PREVENTATIVE SO I TRIED UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE ISSUES? IRVINE I THINK YOUR SUMMER JONES SAWYER AYE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT IS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE IN THAT WE WANTED PREVENT. A MAJOR A PUBLIC HEALTH. ISSUES CATASTROPHE IS EVEN A TO OCCUR AND THE WAY WE DO THAT IS BY NOT JUST HAVING THE INFORMATION BECAUSE WE HAVE INFORMATION THE PROMISE OR NOT. DIRECTING. THE DEPARTMENT AS TO WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION GETTING IT OVER TO CAL OSHA. A IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT THEY CAN DECIDE THAT WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE THE BACK THE MATTER IS YOU CAN HAVE YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF DATA. AND IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT AND YOU DON'T DIRECT. THE PUBLIC PUBLIC HEALTH AS TO WHAT TO DO WITH THAT AND CAL OSHA IS NOT AWARE OF IT THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF COLLECTING THAT DATA AND LET'S KEEP IN MIND AS WELL. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. D. I AM THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WHAT WOULD REQUIRE. OF REPORTING IT A SETTING APART TO QALISYA. IS TWENTY FIVE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE CDC REVISED REVISES GUIDANCEON ADULT LED DOWN FROM TWENTY FIVE MICRONS. TO TEN. MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER EVEN LOWER THAN OUR RECOMMENDED THRESHOLD SO WE COULD EVEN GO TO A LOWER THRESHOLD I THINK. I THINK MATCHING ARKANSAS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T ALLOW. LEVELS OF LEAD TO CONTINUE AT THE WORK SITE BECAUSE FRANKLY I'M I THINK MOST EMPLOYERS WITH IF THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S THE CASE WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. UP BUT GO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IF THEY HAD INFORMATION AND CAL OSHA WORKS WITH THEM TO ENSURE THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT. SO AB AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT WORKER SAFETY WORKER PROTECTIONS BUT ULTIMATELY IT SAVES EMPLOYERS IN THE LONG RUN AS WELL FROM HAVING TO. DO A MUCH GREATER REMEDIAL WORK THAN IF THEY HAD THAT INFORMATION EARLY ON AND WERE GIVEN DIRECTION TO AN INSPECTION TO AN INVESTIGATION EARLY ON. AND AYE AND ACTUALLY HELPS EMPLOYERS MAKE THEIR OF. WORK SITE SAPER AND ECONOMICALLY A IS ALSO BENEFICIAL TO THEM AS WELL UP BUT OF COURSE THE CRUX OF THIS BILL IS WORKER SAFETY. NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY COMMUNITY SAFETY AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN FAR TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF. BECAUSE OF THAT LACK COMMUNICATION AND TO AND DIRECTION AS TO WHAT TO DO THAT INFORMATION. THAT UP WE'RE NOT DOING OUR JOB AS AS LEGISLATORS AND AS A STATE TO MAKE SURE PROTECTING OUR WORKERS. I KNOW CHAMBER CAME ITEM ONE OF. DID YOU. CAN ONLY GO OUT PLEASE COME FORWARD FAIRS COME FORWARD. AND I AYE MY AND MY DISTRICTS RIGHT NEXT TO THE EXCISE EXCITE PLANTS THEN AND IT'S HAD AN IMPACT ON MY. COMMUNITY MY RESIDENTS. AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED. WHAT HAPPENED ELECT SIDE OF? I'M MORE. WE SHOULD BEEN DOING THIS AWHILE AGO SO I JUST WANT TO HEAR. WHAT YOU'RE? THINK UNITS AGAIN OR DID I DESCRIBE IT WRONG. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. SO OUR OUR ISSUE ISN'T THAT WHETHER. THERE'S A SAFETY HAZARD HERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE PROCESS AND THAT CAL OSHA HAS THE JURISDICTION OVER WORKPLACE SAFETY IF WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH WITH LEAD LEVELS AND HOW WE'RE TREATING THEM AND HOWARD TREATING SPORTED A LEAD. IN THE WORKPLACE WE NEED TO GO THROUGH CAL OCEAN THROUGH STANDARD CHANNELS AND HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. IF THE INFORMATION THAT. DID THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS COLLECTING. IS NOT GETTING CAL OSHA IN A MANNER THAT. THAT IT SHOULD BE AND SO THAT IT CAN BE DEALT WITH AND AND REVIEWED AND PROPER STEPS CAN BE TAKEN. THAT THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION BUT TAKEN THE INFORMATION AND SETTING A LIMIT HERE WITHOUT. THE SCIENCE BEING DEBATED THROUGH THE THE MEANS THE CALIPHATE HAS TO REVIEW SCIENCE AND THEY DO THEY HAVE A SPECIAL COMMITTEE IN A SPECIAL PROCESS. FOR REVIEWING HEALTH HAZARDS. US SUCH AS LEAD. THEN WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT PERHAPS WITH CAL OSHA. HOW THIS HOW THIS INFORMATION CAN GET TO THEM AND AND WHAT WHAT THEY'LL DO WITH IT? SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S MORE FOR US IT'S A PROCESS QUESTION WE WE WE. WE RISK HIGHLY RESPECT THE WORK OF CAL OSHA AND THEIR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY HAZARDS AND DETERMINE THEIR PRIORITIES WITHIN THE LIMITS THAT THEY. THEY WORK WITH THEM WITHIN THAT THE RESOURCES SO. WE. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROCESS. WERE WE COULD LOOK AT AT THE ISSUE AND HOW TO PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES BETTER AND HOW IT YOU'D IN THAT IN THAT REGARD SO WE'RE NOT DISPUTING. THE HOUSE HEARD WERE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ESTABLISHING THROUGH THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT YOU OTHER QUESTIONS SOME COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEN NONE OF WILL GO AHEAD AND ESTABLISH. OUR ROLE FIRSTS. ANTIQUITY WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THURMOND HERE FLORA. GONZALEZ FLETCHER JONES SAWYER. KALRA. MCCARTY. MELENDEZ. CORMS DOT.

THE ASSASSINATION OF DR KING AND OF COURSE HE WAS MARCHING FOR MEMPHIS SILENCE SANITATION WORKERS. ID WAS THERE FOR THE CENTERS WAS NOT JUST. OF FOR THE DIGNITY OF WORK FOR WAGES BUT WHEN IT CAME THE DIGGING YOU WORK IN TERMS OF THE TOXICITY THAT THEY WERE FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND OF THE PROTECTION OF THE WORKERS AND SO. WE.

OUR NAMES WILL ASSIGN OPEN RICHARDSON WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING A BETWEEN NINE SIXTY THREE. WE KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW IMPORTANT THIS LEGISLATION IS PROTECT FUTURE AND CURRENT WORKERS FROM LEAD POISONING HURTING THEIR LIVES. OUT HIS ARTWORK AND THE BURN IMPLANT. IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES AFTER A FEW YEARS WORKING THIS MELTING THEM ALBUMS ARE EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS WE NOW KNOW WERE RELATED TO LET. EARLY ON IT WAS SMALL THINGS PROBLEMS ALBUMS HANDS HOLDING ON OBJECTS LATER THE ISSUES GOT MORE SERIOUS HAPPENED SPEECH BECAME SLOWER THERE WAS A SLOWNESS ABOUT ARMY SEEM DRAIN AND SLUGGISH. YOU MIGHT RIGHTLY ASK WHY WOULD ANYONE IS STILL A JOB LIKE THAT THE TRUTH IS. AYE ALLEN SIMPLY NEED A PAYCHECK AND MAYBE I TRUSTED TOO MUCH WE'RE FREQUENTLY LEAD TESTED MY NUMBERS GOT TOO HIGH WILL BE SENT HOME UPLAND WAS CALLED LIGHT DUTY THAT WAS MOSTLY OUTSIDE PAINTING WORK. WHEN LEVELS CAME DOWN IT WAS BACK TO THE STARTING ROOM AND WHEN I LIKE THAT TYPE MONEY THAT THE COMPANY TWO THOUSAND AD WITH THE SYMPTOMS GOT TOO BAD. WE READ THE RECENT BEST HISTORIAN WAS VERY HURTFUL TO LEARN THE CALLOW SHARE EXCUSE THE HIGH LEAD LEVELS AT ALBANY AND OTHER ACTS AYE WORKERS WERE CONSTANT EXPOSED TO. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE TREATED LIKE THEIR DISPOSABLE THAT'S NOT WHAT AMERICA CALIFORNIA'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. AGAIN THANK YOU OF FOR SUPPORTING THIS IMPORTANT BILL FOR MAKING CALIFORNIA BETTER PLACE SO OTHER FAMILIES DON'T HAVE TO ENDURE THE PAIN THAT WE HAVE. WITH THAT A RESPECT ESCRIBO. THANK YOU OF THIS BILL HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION LET US DO ALL WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR. OUR WORKERS AND OTHER SOFT FROM LEAD WITH THAT. MEN'S UPDATE THESE CULTURAL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMOND AYE THURMOND AYE FLORA. FLORA NOW GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER I JONES SAWYER BY JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA AYE KALRA AYE MCCARTY MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ NOT VOTING. NOT VOTING OR NO. NOT VOTING. OTHER BILLS OUT CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. KAT WILL NOW HERE A FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAMBIADO ON AB TWENTY NINE FIFTEEN WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUMBIA. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE FIFTEEN. WHICH WILL DIRECT THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO CONVENE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S TO DEVELOP AMENDED MEMORANDUM MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING. WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ASSIST REGION'S DAMAGED AND DEVASTATED BY A NATURAL DISASTER BY SENDING STAFF AND RESOURCES TO ASSIST IN OUTREACH AS WELL AS BUSINESS AND CLIENT SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY AN MOU BETWEEN THE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S WILL ALLOW FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BASS LINE SERVICE EXPECTATIONS ACROSS THE WORK FORCE SYSTEM AS WELL AS TRAINING FOR THAT BASS LINE. IT'S CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN FROM RECENT FLOODS FIRES AND MUD SLIDES THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO HELP BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES RECOVER. AND HELP WORKERS WHO ARE DISPLACED BECAUSE OF THE DISASTER. CURRENTLY NINETY PERCENT OF SMALL BUSINESSES FAIL WITHIN ONE YEAR IF THEY DO NOT GET SUPPORT WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF A NATURAL DISASTER. NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANT FUNDS WHICH ARE FEDERAL FEDERAL FUNDS. AND OUR DISCRETIONARY CONTAIN TAKE MONTHS TO ARRIVE THE GRANTS CAN PROVIDE FUNDING TO CREATE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT DISPLACED WORKERS TO ASSIST IN CLEAN UP. REPAIR AND RECOVERY EFFORTS AND TO LEARN ON THE JOB SKILLS WHICH MAY HELP THEM IN THE FUTURE. A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION THIS NECESSARY TO ALLOW THE FORTY FIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS TO COME TOGETHER AND UNDER ONE UMBRELLA OF MUTUAL AID SO THAT THEY CAN LEVERAGE RESOURCES IN TIMES OF NEED. CURRENTLY THERE'S NO MECHANISM FROM FOR THEM FROM OUTSIDE THE DISASTER AT AREA TO PROVIDE STAFF AND SUPPORT TO AID THE BUSINESSES FAMILIES AND WORKERS THAT ARE AFFECTED. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTEEN PROVIDES A MECHANISM TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES WHEN THEY MOST NEED IT. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ERIK FLORES WITH THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM ERIK FLOWERS IN THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION. WE ARE THE NONPROFIT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS THE FORTY FIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FEMA STATISTICS SHOW THAT NINETY PERCENT OF SMALL BUSINESSES FAIL WITHIN ONE YEAR OF A NATURAL DISASTER IF THEY DO NOT GET ASSISTANCE WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THAT DISASTER. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTEEN IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MUTUAL AID AMMO YOU IS MADE AND KEPT THE PRIORITY AMONG WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR CLARITY SURROUNDING MUTUAL AID ASSISTANCE ACROSS LOCAL WORKFORCE JURISDICTIONS IN THE EVENT OF WORK FOR SPORTS RESPONDING ACROSS BOUNDARIES TO NATURAL DISASTERS. WHILE LOCAL WORK FOR SPORTS HAVE A HISTORY OF REGIONAL WORK AND COLLABORATION DURING TIMES OF NATURAL DISASTERS THERE'S NEVER BEEN CLARITY ON WHAT REGIONAL ACTIVITIES LOCAL BOARDS MAY UNDERTAKE. MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS ARE USED EFFECTIVELY BY HOSPITALS AND FIRST RESPONDERS BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF CLARITY OF WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. AS NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE BECOME CALIFORNIA'S NEW NORMAL WE MUST LEVERAGE THESE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS TO ALLOW SWIFTER RESPONSES TO DEVASTATION. WHILE LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS BUSINESS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ARE PROFESSIONALS TRAINED TO PROVIDE TARGETED SERVICES TO BUSINESS OWNERS TO HELP KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. OFTENTIMES DISASTERS SUCH AS LAST YEAR'S FIRES IN THE NORTH BAY OR MONTHS HE DOES MUDSLIDES PREVENT THOSE WORKERS FROM REACHING THOSE AFFECTED. IN CINEMA COUNTY THE BURNING OF THE HILTON CINEMA RESULTED IN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE SUDDENLY WITHOUT THEIR LIVELIHOOD. YOU COMBINE THAT WITH OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE AFFECTED THE LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARD IT WAS QUICKLY OVERWHELMED. ENSURING MUTUAL AID COULD MEAN CRITICAL DAYS BEEN SHAVED OFF RESPONSE TIMES AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND AT A TIME WHEN OUR REGION NEEDS ECONOMIC INVESTMENT IN REBUILDING THE MOST. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTEEN IS SPECIFIC AND TARGETED IN SCOPE IT IS NOT A STATE MANDATE BUT RATHER DESIGNED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FROM STATE AND LOCAL POLICY LEADERS ON WHAT IS AND IS NOT AN ALLOWABLE ACTIVITY UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. WHEN LOCAL BOARDS WHICH TO UNDERTAKE MUTUAL AID EFFORTS TO HELP WITH CRITICAL TASK OF DISASTER RELIEF. CURRENTLY THERE IS A NEED TO TACKLE TEMPORARY WORKERS AND DISPLACED WORKERS TO LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT ARE SEEKING WE ARE. RECOVERY SERVICES. ACCORDING TO FEMA AGAIN FORTY TO SIXTY PERCENT OF BUSINESSES DON'T REOPEN AT ALL AFTER A DISASTER. IS MADE WORSE BY THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO MECHANISM FOR LOCAL AREAS TO PROVIDE STAFF AND SUPPORT THAT COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND BUSINESSES BEING SAVED OR LOST. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTEEN WILL ENSURE THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD CONVENES THE FORTY FIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE PORTS SO THEY CAN JOIN TOGETHER AND LEVERAGE RESOURCES IN TIMES OF NEED. ANIMAL YOU WITH THE STATE BOARD AS A PARTNER WILL ALLOW FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PEACE LINE SERVICE EXPECTATIONS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AS WELL AS TRAINING FOR THAT BASS LINE AS WELL AS PRIORITIZING WORK FOR SERVICES AND DISASTER RELIEF. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT.

AND SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE HURDLES TO GET PEOPLE TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE WHICH WE SEE WITH MUTUAL AID WITH WITH FIRE AND WHAT HAVE YOU. THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND OTHER SERVICES THAT. THAT BEACON WOULD REALLY HELP TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE SHORT TERM TRAUMA THAT A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE GOING THROUGH DURING A DISASTER SO THANK YOU SO MUCH IN THE BOOK FORD THANK YOU.
