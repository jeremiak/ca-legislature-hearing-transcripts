IN --

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:06.577
THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WAS GOING

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.112
TO SAY IN THIS HEARING I THOUGHT

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:09.213
A LOT ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.983
WAYS THAT WE ACTUALLY MEASURE.

00:34:12.049 --> 00:34:13.384

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:15.720
OUR PRIORITY IN PUBLIC HEALTH

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:17.355
AND SO I ASKED A NUMBER OF STAFF

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.823
FROM ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT TO

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.525
STOP DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:21.993
AND TRY TO CREATE FOR YOU A HAND

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:23.761
OUT THAT SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:25.797
KEY WAYS THAT WE LOOK AT HEALTH

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:27.165

BEFORE YOU YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:31.169
ARE GRAPHS THINGS LIKE THE

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:32.670
NUMBER OF DEATHS RESULTING FROM

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.405
OF A PARTICULAR CONDITION OR

00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:35.773
DISEASE.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.542
THE NUMBER OF PREMATURE DEATHS

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:39.243
WHERE EARLY DEATHS --

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:40.411
SO DUST OF YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:42.246
COUNT AS A HIGHER PRIORITY IF

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:43.881
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY.

00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:44.482
UNDER --

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:46.818
MORBIDITY OR HOW MUCH OF A THAT

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:48.953
A DISEASE THERE IS A SUPPOSED TO

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.521
DOCK WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE.

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:53.324
HOW MANY CASES THERE ARE --

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:54.292
FOR HOW MUCH DISABILITY DO THEY

00:34:54.358 --> 00:34:56.093
COSTS AND OVER WHAT PERIOD OF

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.396
TIME IS IT LIFETIME IS A CHORE

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:01.065
TO SUPPORT AND THEN.

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:02.233
ALSO.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.534
WHICH DISEASES COST MOST BECAUSE

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:04.635
ULTIMATELY WE ARE TRYING TO

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:06.437
BALANCE IN A VERY EXPENSIVE

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:07.872
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.540
SO -- AND

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.008
THEN FINALLY IN ONE OF THE

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:12.210
THINGS THAT THAT YOU'LL SEE IN

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:13.277

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:15.279
VERY OFTEN IS A A DISPARITIES

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:16.380
INDEX.

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:18.416
THIS IS LOOKING AT DISEASES BY

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:20.451
WHICH OF THEM HAVE THE GREATEST

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:21.919
DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:24.055
BASED ON THE SUB POPULATION THAT

00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:25.490
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE NEEDS IN

00:35:25.556 --> 00:35:27.225
PARTICULAR ARE DISEASES AND

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.159
CONDITIONS.

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:30.127
THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:31.195
OUR MOST VULNERABLE OR

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:33.698
CHRONICALLY DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE

00:35:33.764 --> 00:35:34.932
AND COMMUNITIES.

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.834
AND THEN FINALLY THERE ARE THE

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:39.303
REEMERGING OR EMERGING DISEASES.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.071
AND THEN THOSE THAT ARE

00:35:40.137 --> 00:35:42.006
INCREASING RAPIDLY ENOUGH TO

00:35:42.073 --> 00:35:43.941
PRESENT A CONCERN THAT IF

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:45.443
THEY'RE NOT A DRASTIC ACTUALLY

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.911
POSE A THREAT EITHER TO THE

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:49.046
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR TO THE

00:35:49.113 --> 00:35:50.781

SO COLLECTING AND ANALYZING DATA

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:53.417
AND THEN TURNING IT INTO

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.553
INFORMATION THAT INFORMS POLICY

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.021
IN ACTION IS A FOUNDATIONAL

00:35:57.088 --> 00:35:58.422
PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTION

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:08.366
CONDITIONS WE MONITOR OVER TIME

00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:10.902
AND WE CREATE MANY REPORTS SOME

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:12.303

AND OTHER KINDS OF REPORTS I

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:16.707
JUST WANTED TO MENTION THREE OF

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:18.142
THEM ONE IS --

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:19.076

CONTAINS STATE AND COUNTY DATA

00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:26.150
FOR A NUMBER OF INDICATORS THAT

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:27.752
ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE CDC AND

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:29.320
THE NATIONAL CENTER.

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:31.122
FOR HEALTH STATISTICS AND THEN

00:36:31.188 --> 00:36:33.758
IT PROVIDES PERCENTAGES FOR THE

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.560
COUNTIES AND RANKING HOW THEY

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:36.527
RANK IN THE STATE BUT THEN

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:37.929
COMPARES THEM TO THE HEALTHY

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:39.564
PEOPLE TWENTY TWENTY NATIONAL.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.998
GOALS FOR THESE --

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:42.233
INDICATORS.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.435
WE ALSO PUT OUT WE DIRECT AND

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:46.604
MANAGE THE LET'S GET HEALTHY

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:47.371
CALIFORNIA.

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:48.539
SAYS WHICH IS OUR STATE HEALTH

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:49.907
IMPROVEMENT PLAN.

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:50.808
AND THEN LET'S GET HEALTHY WE

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.610
HAVE SPECIFIC INDICATORS THAT WE

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:54.111
FOLLOW OVER TIME THAT ARE

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:56.414
DESIGNED TO REFLECT PROGRESS IN

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.015
SIX DIFFERENT GOAL AREAS --

00:36:58.082 --> 00:36:59.850
THAT ARE OF WITH WHICH WE ARE

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:00.885
ALIGNING WITH OUR LOCAL

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.887
JURISDICTIONS AND OTHER PARTNERS

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:04.121
TO TRY TO ADVANCE HEALTH IN

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:06.190
CALIFORNIA.

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:07.892
AND FINALLY THE SECOND EDITION

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:09.460
OF OUR BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASE

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:11.095
REPORT SHOULD BE COMING OUT

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:12.396
FAIRLY SHORTLY AS WELL.

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:13.831
BUT WE DON'T JUST GATHER DATA

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.166
FOR DATA SAKE IT'S REALLY

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:17.535
IMPORTANT TO US THAT WE USE THAT

00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:19.170
INFORMATION TO HELP SET

00:37:19.236 --> 00:37:21.172
PRIORITIES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:22.673
TO DRIVE EFFECTIVE ACTION.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.609
AND IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE A

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:26.043
FOCUS ON PREVENTION.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.244
AND THAT MEANS THAT WE DON'T

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:29.580
JUST COUNT HOW MANY CASES OF A

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:31.282
PARTICULAR THING THERE ARE BUT

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:32.984
TO THE DEGREE POSSIBLE WE TRY TO

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.186
SEE WHO IS IT IS BEING AFFECTED

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:37.288
WHAT ARE THE INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL

00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:38.856
AND COMMUNITY FACTORS THAT

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.491
EITHER PUT PEOPLE AT RISK.

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:42.994
OR PROTECTION AND THEN THE SAME

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.495
DATA CAN ALSO BE USED TO

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:46.464
EVALUATE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.265
PUT IN PLACE TO TRY.

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:49.467
TO EAT DECREASE THOSE DISEASES

00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:52.837
AND CONDITIONS OVERALL. FOR THE

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:53.971
PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING I'M

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:55.406
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:56.474
HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA BY

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.708
DISCUSSING SOME EXAMPLES WHERE

00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:58.909
WE'VE HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.144
SUCCESSES.

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.712
BUT THEN I ALSO WANT TO MENTION

00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:03.781
SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT THREATS THAT

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:05.383
I SEE TO THE STATE OF OUT TO THE

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:06.584
HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:07.818
AND WHAT I THINK IT'LL TAKE TO

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.520
ADDRESS THEM.

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:11.389
SO FIRST I'M GONNA START AT THE

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:12.890
AT THE BROADEST POSSIBLE LEVEL.

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.358
CALIFORNIA'S SEEN SIGNIFICANT

00:38:14.425 --> 00:38:17.094
IMPROVEMENT IN LIFE EXPECTANCY --

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.596
IN NINETEEN NINETY CALIFORNIA

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:20.097
RANK TWENTY FOURTH AMONG STATES

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:22.466
WITH A LIFE EXPECTANCY AVERAGE

00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:23.901
OF SEVENTY SIX YEARS BUT

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.369
ACCORDING TO MOST MORE RECENT

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:26.604
REPORTS --

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.406
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:30.241
RANK SECOND ONLY TO WHITE WITH

00:38:30.307 --> 00:38:32.076
AN AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:33.244
EIGHTY ONE YEARS THAT'S A PRETTY

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.212
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN LIFE

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:36.747
EXPECTANCY OVER ALL.

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.416
AND THIS WAS THE GREATEST GAME

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.418
OF ANY STATE OVER THAT SAME TIME

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:41.719
PERIOD -- IN

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.821
CHRONIC DISEASES ALL THE RATES

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:45.189
OF DEATH FROM CHRONIC DISEASE

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:47.591
HAVE STEADILY IMPROVED OVER TIME

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:49.427
THEY DO REMAIN SOME OF THE MOST

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:50.928
COMMON AND COSTLY EXPENSE M.

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.029
CONDITIONS.

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:54.265
THAT WE HAVE IN 75% OF ALL

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:56.500
DEATHS ARE ULTIMATELY DUE TO

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:58.035
CHRONIC DISEASES.

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.770
DISEASE AND CANCER --

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.572
BECAUSE NEARLY HALF OF ALL

00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:02.640
DEATHS -- AT

00:39:02.707 --> 00:39:05.076
APPROXIMATELY 25% EACH.

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:06.644
WORRISOME FOR THE FUTURE IS THE

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:08.379
FACT THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.114
CALIFORNIA CHILDREN AND ONE OUT

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:12.116
OF EVERY THREE TEENS ARE ALREADY

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:13.818
OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE.

00:39:13.884 --> 00:39:14.752
A RISK FACTOR FOR CORONARY

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:17.021
ARTERIES --

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.856
AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:20.324
INCLUDING DIABETES.

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:21.859
AND THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:24.061
AND CALIFORNIA'S INCREASED 34%

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:27.565
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN.

00:39:27.631 --> 00:39:29.867
TWENTY SIXTEEN AS OF 20169% OF

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:31.902
ALL ADULTS OR TWO POINT SIX

00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:33.337
MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:36.240
HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES.

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:39.143
AND EVEN MORE CONCERNING --

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.378
46% OF ALL ADULTS WERE THIRTEEN

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:43.247
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:44.749
DIAGNOSED WITH PRE DIABETES.

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:46.050
AND THAT END WITHOUT

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.718
INTERVENTION ON AVERAGE ONE OUT

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:49.120
OF EVERY FOUR OF THOSE PEOPLE

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:51.789
WILL GO ON TO DEVELOP DIABETES.

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:54.425
THIS HAS HUGE RAMIFICATIONS BOTH

00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:56.427
FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND HEALTH

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:58.395
OVERALL BUT ALSO FOR THE COST OF

00:39:58.462 --> 00:39:59.930
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:01.899
AND RATES OF DIABETES ALL OF OUR

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:03.267
DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:05.002
GEOGRAPHIC REGION.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:06.570
THE RATE IN IMPERIAL COUNTY IS

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:09.440
THE HIGHEST AT FOURTEEN POINT 8%.

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:10.641
AND IN MARIN COUNTY WITH THE

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:13.444
LOWEST AT TWO POINT 6%.

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:14.678
NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE GEOGRAPHIC

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.881
VARIATION BUT WE ALSO DIABETES

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.382
IS A DISEASE WHERE WE CAN REALLY

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:19.316
SEE.

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:21.152
THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL

00:40:21.218 --> 00:40:22.820
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:25.422
DIABETES RATES AMONG WHITES 27%

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:26.891
WHILE IT IS AMONG AFRICAN

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:29.360
AMERICANS 9% AND AMONG LATINOS

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:30.995
11%.

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.663
AND RATES ARE THREE TIMES HIGHER

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.231
IN PEOPLE WHO DID NOT COMPLETE

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.933
HIGH SCHOOL THEN THEY AREN'T WHO

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.035
COMPLETED COLLEGE.

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:39.703
AND THEY ARE TWICE AS HIGH IN

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.272
FAMILIES LIVING UNDER THE

00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:43.073
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO EACH OF

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:43.974
THESE.

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:46.377
CHRONIC DISEASES HAS IT'S ROOTS

00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:48.179
IN SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY FACTORS

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:50.281
AS WELL.

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:51.582
BUT WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:52.917
IMPROVEMENTS IN MANY CHRONIC

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:55.386
DISEASES INCLUDING CANCER HEART

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:56.554
DISEASE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.154
STROKES.

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:58.622
OVERALL THE RATES IN ALL OF

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:00.558
THESE HAVE DECREASED.

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:02.560
MANY FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THAT

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.061
DECREASE INCLUDING --

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:06.564
X. TERRIFIC EXTENSION EXPANSION

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.766
OF AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:10.034
HEALTH CARE AND PREVENTIVE

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.836
SERVICES BUT CALIFORNIA'S ALSO

00:41:11.902 --> 00:41:12.970
MADE SOME IMPORTANT POLICY

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:14.104
CHOICES.

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:16.907
A GOOD EXAMPLE IS AROUND SMOKING

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.375
REMAINS THE LEADING CAUSE OF

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:19.810
PREMATURE DEATH TO DISEASE AND

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:22.179
DISABILITY EVEN THOUGH RATES OF

00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:23.514
DEATH FROM LUNG CANCER

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:24.748
RESPIRATORY ILLNESS AND

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:26.116
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE HAVE BEEN

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:27.084
DECREASING.

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:29.286
IT'S STILL THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE

00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:30.688
OF PREMATURE DEATH.

00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:32.289
BUT CHANGES IN POLICY ENACTED

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:33.424
BOTH AT THE STATE AND THE LOCAL

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.727
LEVEL HAVE HAD A MAJOR IMPACT.

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:38.229
CALIFORNIA SMOKING RATES HAVE

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:41.699
DROPPED 54% AMONG ADULTS DOWN TO

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:44.301
TEN POINT 1%. ONE OF THE LOWEST

00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:45.569
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:47.838
AND DOWN TO FOUR POINT 3% FOR

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.540
YOUTH IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:50.975
AND BY TWENTY FOURTEEN LUNG

00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:52.610
CANCER MORTALITY IN CALIFORNIA

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:56.380
DROPPED 43% AND WAS 30% LOWER

00:41:56.447 --> 00:41:57.815
THAN THE REST OF THE NATION AND

00:41:57.882 --> 00:41:58.949
THIS IS GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:00.618
CONTINUE TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:01.819
OVER TIME AS WE HAVE MORE AND

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.287
MORE ADULTS WHO NEVER HAD.

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.222
EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO EITHER

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:08.058
DIRECTLY OR SECOND HAND.

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.326
SO THEN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:11.028
SOME ISSUES THAT I SEE IS REALLY

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:12.696
SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO PUBLIC

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:14.198
HEALTH OVERALL THAT ARE OR

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:14.865
MERGING.

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:16.600
OPIATES AS YOU ALL KNOW ARE

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:18.068
DRUGS THAT ARE TYPICALLY USED

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:19.003
FOR PAIN RELIEF.

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.771
THINGS LIKE CODEINE HYDROCODONE

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:22.339
IN FENTON ALL ARE THE WORDS THAT

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:23.474
YOU'LL HEAR MOST FREQUENTLY IN

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.975
THIS CONVERSATION.

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.777
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:28.178
CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL RATE OF

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:29.947
OPIOID ASSOCIATED OVERDOSES AND

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:32.850
DEATHS IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:33.717
NATIOAL AVERAGE.

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:36.353
WITH NEARLY TWO THOUSAND OPIOID

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.889
ASSOCIATED DEATHS AND OVER EIGHT

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:39.924
THOUSAND HOSPITAL EMERGENCY

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.758
DEPARTMENT.

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:42.259
ADMISSIONS AND TWENTY FOUR

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:44.028
MILLION PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:46.030
EVERY YEAR FOR OPIATES WE STILL

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:47.298
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:48.933
PROBLEM.

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:50.200
LIKE THE REST OF THE NATION

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:51.302
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN STRUGGLING

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:52.636
WITH THIS ISSUE FOR OVER A

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:53.971
DECADE.

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:56.707
THE RECENT SHARP INCREASE IN IN

00:42:56.774 --> 00:42:58.008
OVERDOSES AND DEATHS THAT HAS

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.944
GARNERED SO MUCH ATTENTION IS

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.745
LARGELY DUE.

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:05.983
TO THE I A POORLY UNDERSTOOD --

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.484
BASICALLY MALFUNCTIONING --

00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:09.186
PRESCRIPTION PAIN MANAGEMENT

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:11.288
ISSUE BUT IN RECENT RECENT THE

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:13.190
LAST TWO YEARS DESPITE EFFECTIVE

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:15.225
INTERVENTIONS THAT HAD INITIALLY

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:17.795
DECREASED PRESCRIPTION RELATED

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:19.396
OPIOID OVERDOSES AND US.

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:20.631
THE EPIDEMIC HAS INCREASINGLY

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:23.300
SHIFTED NOW TO ILLICIT DRUG USE.

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:25.936
WE'VE WE HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESS.

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:27.338
OPIOID PRESCRIBING RATES HAVE

00:43:27.404 --> 00:43:30.240
DECREASED SHARPLY SINCE TWENTY

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:31.442
FIFTEEN I'M PRESCRIPTION OPIOID

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:32.843
ASSOCIATED DUST REACHED THEIR

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.412
LOWEST LEVEL IN.

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:36.013
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS IS ALL

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:36.814
GOOD NEWS.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.282
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT HEROIN

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:40.084
ASSOCIATED OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:44.088
INCREASED 97% SINCE.

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:44.588
TWENTY TWELVE AND FENNEL

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:47.891
ASSOCIATED US HAVE INCREASED

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:48.859
FOUR HUNDRED AND 23%.

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.761
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:52.396
THAT WILL REQUIRE ENTIRELY

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.398
DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:55.299
AND THOSE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:56.600
USE TO BRING DOWN PRESCRIBING

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:59.203
RATES.

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:00.270
THERE IS WHY GEOGRAPHIC

00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:02.373
VARIATION IN THE OPIOID CRISIS

00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:03.774
ALSO WITHIN THE OUR NORTHERN

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:05.175
RURAL COUNTIES HAVING THE

00:44:05.242 --> 00:44:07.678
GREATEST BURDEN OF DISEASE AND

00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:09.947
THE MOST ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:12.249
ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE THAT IS

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:13.851
GETTING LESS ATTENTION IS

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:15.119
SUICIDE.

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:16.754
SUICIDE RATES HAVE DECLINED

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.255
SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE NINETEEN

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:19.890
NINETIES BUT THEY'VE INCREASED

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:21.592
IN THE MOST RECENT DECADE AND

00:44:21.658 --> 00:44:23.027
ARE NOW DOUBLE THE HOMICIDE

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.461
RATES.

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:26.296
IN FACT SUICIDE ACCOUNTS FOR

00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:28.265
NEARLY TWICE THE NUMBER OF DATE

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.933
DEATH STATE WIDE AS OPIOIDS OR

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.568
HOMICIDE.

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.070
AND IT'S ONE OF THE TOP TEN

00:44:33.137 --> 00:44:34.338
CAUSES OF PREMATURE DEATH IN

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:35.506
CALIFORNIA.

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:37.408
AND WE KNOW THAT SUICIDE IS

00:44:37.474 --> 00:44:39.810
ACTUALLY UNDER REPORTED ON DEATH

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:41.912
CERTIFICATES TO THE THE PROBLEM

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:43.380
IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT.

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:44.948
MEN COMMIT SUICIDE AT THREE

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:46.550
TIMES THE RATE OF WOMEN.

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:47.885
THAT ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY

00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:49.553
TO USE A FIREARM.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.621
AND WHILE THE HIGHEST RATES

00:44:50.687 --> 00:44:52.689
AMONG MALES ARE IN THOSE OVER

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.425
EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE SUICIDE IS

00:44:54.491 --> 00:44:55.793
THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:56.960
DEATH AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:59.396
YOUTH AGES.

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:00.030
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AND THAT

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:00.497
SHOULD CONCERN US ALL

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:02.332
TREMENDOUSLY.

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:03.801
MANY OF THE SAME COMMUNITIES

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.502
THAT SEE HIGH RATES OF OPIOID

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:07.337
OVERDOSES PARTICULARLY NOR THE

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:09.440
NORTHERN RURAL COUNTIES ALSO

00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:11.375
EXPERIENCE ASIDE RATES HIGHER

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:15.379
THAN THE STATE AVERAGE.

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:16.046
AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO TALK

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.247
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SEXUALLY

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:18.415
TRANSMITTED DISEASES IN THE

00:45:18.482 --> 00:45:20.050
SHARP INCREASE THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:21.452
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:22.953
THERE WERE OVER THREE HUNDRED

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.721
THOUSAND CASES OF STDS REPORTED

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:27.724
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH IS UP

00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:29.159
45% FROM JUST FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:30.127
AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST CONCERN

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:33.197
IS THE RESEARCH TIRE LEAP

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:34.765
PREVENTABLE CONDITION OF

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:36.400
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS.

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:37.835
DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE WERE

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:39.470
SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING AT

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.905
LEAST 70% OF POTENTIAL

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:43.841
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES BY

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:45.576
DETECTING IT EARLY IN TREATING.

00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:47.344
THE MOTHER THERE WERE STILL TWO

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:48.512
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE CASES

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:51.048
OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:51.615
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THIRTY

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:54.751
SURPLUS ASSOCIATED STILLBIRTHS.

00:45:54.818 --> 00:45:55.319
THAT'S THE HIGHEST IN TWENTY

00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:56.820
YEARS.

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.489
MOST OF THE WOMEN WHO GAVE BIRTH

00:45:58.555 --> 00:45:59.923
TO BABIES WITH CONGENITAL

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.958
SYPHILIS.

00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:03.060
HAD DID NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE OR

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:04.728
TIMELY PRENATAL CARE.

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:05.562
WHICH COULD HAVE PREVENTED

00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:07.331
TRANSMISSION.

00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:08.899
THE MOST COMMON MATERNAL RISK

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:11.201
FACTORS FOR CONGENITAL SYPHILIS

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.704
WERE SUBSTANCE USE HOMELESSNESS

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.706
THE EXCHANGE OF SEX FOR MONEY OR

00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:18.342
DRUGS AND CONTACT WITH THE SALE

00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:19.877
WITH THE JAIL SYSTEM.

00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:22.212
SO STRANGE AS IT MAY HAVE SEEMED

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:24.114
FROM THE OUTSIDE AS WE TALK

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:25.916
ABOUT THE RISK FACTORS FOR THESE

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:27.584
THREE EMERGING CONDITIONS.

00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:29.953
FATAL AND NO FATAL OVERDOSES

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.288
SUICIDE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:33.490
DISEASES SURE MANY OF THE SAME

00:46:33.557 --> 00:46:35.092
UNDERLYING CAUSES.

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:36.793
AND THEY ARE INCREASING DESPITE

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.061
THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WE'VE

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:39.730
MADE EXPANDING ACCESS TO

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:41.498
AFFORDABLE HER HEALTH CARE

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:42.799
ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:43.967
IN LARGE PART THIS IS BECAUSE

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:46.803
THESE DISEASES ARE NOT JUST

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:47.938
DISEASES OF PEOPLE BUT OF

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.606
COMMUNITIES AND OF SOCIETY

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:50.474
OVERALL.

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:51.675
AND THERE ARE RISING AT A TIME

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:52.776
WHEN INCREASING NUMBERS OF

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:54.845
CALIFORNIANS SIMPLY CANNOT

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:57.080
AFFORD THE BASIC COSTS OF LIVING

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.716
THINGS LIKE HEALTHY FOOD.

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:00.817
AND STABLE HOUSING.

00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:01.919
HOPELESSNESS AND DESPAIR ARE

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:03.854
COMMON SYMPTOMS REPORTED IN ALL

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:06.256
OF THESE CONDITIONS [inaudible]

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:08.125
THESE.

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:10.327
ALSO HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN ADVERSE

00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:12.262
EXPERIENCES IN CHILDHOOD THINGS

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:13.797
LIKE POVERTY.

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:14.798
VIOLENCE AND OTHER FORMS OF

00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:16.500
TRAUMA.

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:18.702
AND STICK MY REMAINS A POWERFUL

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:22.639
BARRIER TO SEEKING HELP.

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:24.975
IN ADDITION TO THAT EACH OF

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:26.310
THESE REFLECTS --

00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:27.878
AN INCREASING RELIANCE ON A

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:29.146
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT ALONE

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.281
SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:33.317
ADD TO FIX THEM BECAUSE IT CAN

00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:34.985
REALLY ONLY TREAT THE SYMPTOMS

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:36.486
AND NOT THE ROOT CAUSES.

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:38.322
ULTIMATELY ADDRESSING THESE AND

00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:41.191
OTHER DISEASES OF DESPAIR.

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:43.060
AS I LIKE TO REFER TO THEM WILL

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:45.495
REQUIRE A SYSTEM OF PREVENTION

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:47.664
THAT ADDRESSES ROOT CAUSES LIKE

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:49.233
POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS.

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:51.535
AND VIOLENCE IN ADDITION TO A

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:54.438
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT.

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:55.739
CAN PROVIDE TREATMENT FREE FROM

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:57.641
BIAS AND STIGMA AND THAT

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:58.775
RECOGNIZES THAT MENTAL AND

00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:00.911
EMOTIONAL HEALTH IS AS IN FOR

00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:03.413
GOAL AS PHYSICAL HEALTH TO THE

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.815
WELL BEING OF PEOPLE.

00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:06.416
MAKING SIGNIFICANT AND

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:07.651
SUSTAINABLE CHANGES IN THE

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:09.686
PUBLIC'S HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:10.787
GOING TO REQUIRE THAT WE HAVE A

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.823
GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW

00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:14.324
THESE SOCIAL PHYSICAL AND

00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:15.759
BEHAVIORAL.

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:16.326
FACTORS.

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:19.463
THAT AFFECT HEALTH AND FIGURING

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:21.531
OUT WHAT LEVERS WE CAN USE TO

00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:23.233
MOST EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVE AND

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.601
MAINTAIN A HEALTHY AND RESILIENT

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:26.069
CALIFORNIA.

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:27.904
THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:28.905

SEE IF ANYONE HAD ANY SPECIFIC

00:48:34.344 --> 00:48:38.715
QUESTIONS.

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:44.554
IF NOT THEN I WILL --

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:46.356

MISTER CHAIR --

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:49.459
JUST AS WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.028
INCREASED RATES OF SUICIDE

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.329
WITHIN OUR YOUTH IS THERE

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:53.964
ANYTHING.

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:55.666
LOOKING AT TIME LINES FROM WHEN

00:48:55.732 --> 00:48:57.868
WE STARTED IN OR DO YOU SEEN --

00:48:57.934 --> 00:48:59.269
CONVERSATIONS OF ASSISTED

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:01.171
SUICIDE WITHIN THE ELEMENTARY

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:03.640
SCHOOL CURRICULUM. TO I MEAN

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:04.608
JUST.

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.642
THE FACT THAT IT'S GOING INTO

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:08.945
THESE KIDS' HEADS MUCH YOUNGER.

00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:11.548
JUST MAKES ME WONDER --

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.916
THIS IS THE THE INCREASE STARTED

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:14.418
WELL BEFORE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:15.986
WERE HAPPENING AND SEEMS TO BE

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:17.587
MUCH MORE RELATED --

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:19.189
TO PARTICULARLY IN ADOLESCENCE A

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:21.258
FEELING OF HOPELESSNESS AND THEY

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:22.392
KNOW THEIR FAMILIES ARE

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:23.493
STRUGGLING AND THEY'RE

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.062
STRUGGLING AND A FEELING OF

00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:26.630
ISOLATION SOCIAL ISOLATION IN

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:27.764
PARTICULAR.

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.366
IS ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES AND

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:31.301
THEN IN SOME CASES --

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:32.703

AMERICAN POPULATION THE STATE OF

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:58.829
CALIFORNIA I SEE THE DIFFERENT --

00:49:58.895 --> 00:50:02.332
RATIO HIGHEST POPULATION OF

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:03.834
NATIVE AMERICANS --

MANY TIMES IN OUR REPORTS WHAT

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:30.427
YOU'LL SEE IS THEY WON'T BE

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:31.895
REPORTED AND IT'S BECAUSE THE

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:33.230
NUMBERS ARE SO SMALL THAT THERE

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.398
IS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:35.665
LOOKING OVER TIME.

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:37.467
THEY'RE NOT STABLE ENOUGH TO

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:39.369

OLDER OLDER CALIFORNIANS WHO MAY

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:10.460
BE ON HIGH DOSES OF OPIOIDS --

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:11.061
IS YOU KNOW THIS THAT IN THAT

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:14.364
BEING A THERE IN IN IN IN AN

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:15.866
EARLIER TASK.

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:18.468
SO I WONDER IF IS THAT.

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.003
BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.638
IS THAT A POSSIBILITY OR THE

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:23.740
NUMBERS POTENTIALLY UNDER

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:26.076
REPORTED --

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:27.577
A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:28.645
SENIORS DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:30.080
BE ON HIGH DOSES OF OPIATES IF

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:31.848
THEY'RE ALSO THEIR NUMEROUS

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:32.916
OTHER MEDICATIONS PARTICULAR

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.317
BENZODIAZEPINES AS WELL.

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:35.252
IN FACT WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.520
LAUNCHING --

00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:38.688
LATER THIS YEAR A AN EDUCATIONAL

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:40.457
CAMPAIGN SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.125
AT OLDER AMERICANS HELPING THEM

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:43.126
UNDERSTAND.

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.794
MY MOTHER FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:45.896
EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FOR

00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:47.697
MEDICATIONS IS AN OPEN RIGHT AND

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:48.899
SO -- THAT

00:52:48.965 --> 00:52:49.499
SOMETHING THAT WE THINK NEEDS

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:51.468
ATTENTION THERE'S NO QUESTION IN

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:52.035
MY MIND THAT THEY'RE UNDER

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:54.504
REPORTED PARTICULARLY ACCIDENTAL

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:55.672
OVERDOSES THAT --

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.374
MAY CONTRIBUTE TO AN EARLIER

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.542
DEATH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE

00:52:58.608 --> 00:53:00.777
BEEN THE CASE OR A COMBINATION

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:02.312
OF POLY PHARMACY MULTIPLE DRUGS

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:03.847
AT THE SAME TIME SUPPRESSING

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:04.881
RESTORATION.

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:06.416
HOW WE GET A HANDLE ON THAT IS

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:08.118
REALLY DIFFICULT MOST PEOPLE

00:53:08.184 --> 00:53:09.653
DON'T WANT TO HAVE AUTOPSIES?

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:11.521
CORNERS ARE OVERWHELMED DEALING

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:13.123
JUST WITH THE THE CASES THAT

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:14.991
THEY DO HAVE WE DO HAVE A

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:16.526
PROJECT ON GOING WITH CORNERS

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:18.261
RIGHT NOW WERE --

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:19.696
ENGAGED WITH AYE WE BURKE FROM

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:21.665
PROVIDING FUNDING. FOR THEM TO

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:23.066
TRANSFER TO A THEY HAVE A VERY

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:25.535
RICH DATA ABOUT THE THE CASES

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:26.903
THAT GET REFERRED TO CORNERS

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.471
THAT INCLUDE A LOT OF THE SOCIAL

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:29.906
SITUATIONS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:30.907
OF DEATH.

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:34.277
AND WE THINK BY LOOKING AT THAT

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:36.913
INFORMATION WILL THINK WE WILL

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.049
SEE SOME SENIORS IN THAT

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:40.817
POPULATION AS WELL.

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.018
SO FAR.

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:44.321
SO CORNERS ROUTINELY DO

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.722
TOXICOLOGY SKI --

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:49.225
PANELS ON ON PEOPLE DIE UNDER WE

00:53:49.292 --> 00:53:51.261
HAVE RISE SO OR OPIOIDS NOT

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:51.861
TRADITIONALLY A PART OF THAT

00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:52.963
PANEL.

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:55.665
THEY ARE THE THE DIFFERENCES

00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:56.066
THAT.

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:57.701
SENIORS ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO

00:53:57.767 --> 00:53:58.735
ACTUALLY --

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:00.136
BE TAKEN UP AS A CORONER'S CASE

00:54:00.203 --> 00:54:02.539
SO WHEN SO WHEN SOMEONE'S DIED

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:04.541
UNEXPECTEDLY WERE IN THE

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:06.876
HOSPITAL THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN

00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:08.278
WILL CALL THE CORONER'S OFFICE

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:09.512
WITH THE CORONER'S OFFICE

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:10.480
DOESN'T HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.881
TAKE THAT PERSON IF THERE'S A

00:54:11.948 --> 00:54:13.650
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY MAY

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:14.517
HAVE DIED THAT'S PARTICULARLY.

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:16.753
TRUE IN PEOPLE OVER EIGHTY FOR

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.521
EXAMPLE TO THEY RARELY END UP

00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:22.492
GOING TO A CORNER [inaudible]

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:25.495
THANK YOU.

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:27.063
ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.131
THANK YOU OF DOCTOR WHEN YOU

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:29.633
TALK ABOUT THE WELL BEING OR THE

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:31.568
MENTAL HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN.

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:32.802
AND YOU LOOK AT THE SILOS THAT

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:34.638
HAVE BEEN CREATED ABOUT THE WELL

00:54:34.704 --> 00:54:36.940
BEING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THE

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.074
HEALTH SYSTEM.

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:39.476
WE LOOK IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN THE

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:40.910
SCHOOLS HAD PSYCHOLOGIST IN

00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:43.413
ATTENDED TO THE CHILDREN AND

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:43.680
GUIDANCE.

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:45.215
COUNSELORS.

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:46.249
WHEN THERE BE A BETTER

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:46.549
[inaudible]

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:49.853
OPPORTUNITY TO CO MINGLE.

00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:53.156
WITH SCHOOL THE SCHOOLS AND ALSO

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:53.990
HEALTH CARE --

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:56.292
INDUSTRY.

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:57.827
BECAUSE I AM ITALIAN SOLANO

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:58.862
COUNTY WHERE I REPRESENT.

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:00.997
WE HAVE ZERO PEDIATRIC CRISIS

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:03.967
BEDS [inaudible] ZERO WHEN YOU

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:05.802
LOOK AT THAT THEN THEY

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:07.404
AUTOMATICALLY GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.305
INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AFTER

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:10.573
NOT SEVENTY OF FIFTY ONE FIFTY

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.308
THAT SEVEN TWO HOURS THE

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:13.510
RELEASED AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:15.979
WITH NO REAL CARE.

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:16.980
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WELL

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:19.449
BEING.

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:20.750
SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT A

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:22.619
HOLISTIC APPROACH.

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:25.522
AND THE WHOLE OVERALL --

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:27.824
A DEPUTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:29.759
STABILITY FOR THE CHILDREN.

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:31.361
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I THINK

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:32.729
THAT IT'S NOT JUST SCHOOLS

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:33.797
SCHOOLS ARE VITAL IS

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:35.665
PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNGER KIDS

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:36.800
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:38.334
DOING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:39.903
IDENTIFYING CHILDREN.

00:55:39.969 --> 00:55:42.272
EARLY WHO HAVE RISK FACTORS FROM

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:43.606
GOING ON TO HAVING SUBSTANTIAL

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:45.241
BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS AND WE KNOW

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:47.277
WHAT MANY OF THOSE ARE BUT AS

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:49.079
YOU PUT IT AS YOU'VE MENTIONED.

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:50.880
OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM HAVE WE'VE

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.248
LOST A LOT OF THE KINDS OF

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:53.950
ANCILLARY STAFF THAT WE USED TO

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.985
HELP SCHOOL COUNSELORS NURSES AT

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.487
CETERA -- WE

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:59.089
ARE SEEING AN INCREASING NUMBER

00:55:59.155 --> 00:56:00.623
SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CLINICS AND

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.525
I KNEW THAT THAT WILL HELP BUT

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:04.260
IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH WE WE

00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:06.496
WAIT TOO LONG PARTICULARLY IN

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:08.131
THE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND

00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:09.599
TELL SOMEONE IS IN CRISIS.

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:11.301
WHEN THE BETTER TIME TO

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:12.635
INTERVENE REALLY IS FURTHER?

00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:14.070
UP WHEN YOU FIRST START SEEING

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:15.705
BEHAVIORAL ISSUES AND CAN I YOU

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:17.140
KNOW IF IF YOU HAVE THE

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:17.674
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:18.808
CHILDREN.

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.443
AND DISCOVER WHAT THEIR SOCIAL

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.947
CIRCUMSTANCES YOU TRIGGERS ARE

00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:24.447
FOR THE BEHAVIORS THAT

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:27.817
ULTIMATELY BECOME UNMANAGEABLE.

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:29.352
IT IS JUST ANOTHER PART OF

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:30.186
ANOTHER QUESTION I APPRECIATE

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:32.088
THAT ANSWER BECAUSE IT DOES MEAN

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:33.757
THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS.

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:37.026
TO ABSOLUTELY 1100% NOTHING IT

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:39.262
IS FAR AS PART OF THE OF THIS

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:40.196
WHOLE.

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:42.298
SURVEY THAT IS PUT TOGETHER IT'S

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:42.665
VERY EXTENSIVE.

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:43.800
CAN YOU SHARE WITH ME WHAT

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:45.335
PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION OF

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.237
THE THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

00:56:47.303 --> 00:56:48.138
OR PART OF THIS ALSO BECAUSE

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:49.572
THERE.

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:51.441
THERE HAVE THEIR PART OF THE

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:53.109
THREE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:53.743
THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:54.644
CALIFORNIA.

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:56.646
THAT HAVE ALL OF THESE HEALTH

00:56:56.713 --> 00:56:59.816
ISSUES BUT THEY'RE HARD --

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:02.118
TO SCREEN EVEN EVEN IN SPECIAL

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:03.219
OF HIS WIT INSTITUTE OF HEALTHY

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:05.488
ATHLETES PROGRAM BECAUSE IT WORK

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:06.723
GETTING ADEQUATE CARE.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.358
SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:09.926
WE'RE TOUCHING HIS POPULATION

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:11.728
ALSO LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT THE

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:13.296
NATIVE AMERICANS --

00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:15.732
SO IN TERMS OF OF THE DATA THAT

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:17.000
WE ACQUIRE SOME OF THE DATA

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.067
SOURCES THAT WE HAVE ARE VERY

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:19.402
SPECIFIC AND ASKING ABOUT

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:20.937
DISABILITYTHAT'S WHY YOU SEE

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:22.705
SORT OF DISABILITY ADJUSTED LIFE

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:24.040
YEARS THAT WE THAT.

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:25.675
BUT THERE ARE OTHER DATA SOURCES

00:57:25.742 --> 00:57:26.643
THAT JUST DON'T TAKE THAT INTO

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:28.244
CONSIDERATION AND SO IT REALLY

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:30.213
IS GETTING A COMPREHENSIVE

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.282
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE THE

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.917
POPULATION LOOKS LIKE AS A WHOLE

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:36.219
REQUIRES WE HAVE WELL OVER TWO

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:37.220
HUNDRED DIFFERENT DATA STREAMS

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.221
AND THEY'RE ALL.

00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:39.889
THE DIFFERENT WHAT THEY

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:43.092
COLLECTED ABOUT RAM AND WHETHER

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:44.994
IT'S SURVEY AND SO IT'S A IT'S A

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:46.729
HUGE LEFT TO KIND OF TAKE ALL OF

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:48.198
THAT DATA.

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:49.499
DO AN ANALYSIS IT KIND OF PUTS

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:51.668
IT TOGETHER WE TAKE WE GO TO

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:52.969
SPECIAL LANCS TO LOOK FOR

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:55.038
DISABILITY BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:55.705
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:56.840
OUTCOMES.

00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:58.708
IF YOU CAN DECREASE MORTALITY

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:00.076
THAT'S GREAT BUT IF PEOPLE ARE

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:01.778
LIVING FOR YEARS IN DISABILITY

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:03.146
THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:04.581
BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:05.849
SOMETHING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:07.016
THEN THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:08.818
WORKING ON AS WELL AND SO I

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:10.687
SHARE YOUR PRIORITY AS FAR AS

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:11.788
WHETHER OR NOT.

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:14.057
WE'RE PROVIDING THEM WITH

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:15.592
ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE SERVICES

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:16.526
THAT'S REALLY.

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:18.461
I THINK PROBABLY NOT BUT I DON'T

00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:20.363
IT'S NOT AN AREA WHERE I HAVE

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:21.965
MUCH EXPERTISE I HAVE TO SAY.

AND I'LL BE BRIEF I APOLOGIZE I

00:58:26.936 --> 00:58:29.339
SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS FIRST BUT

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:30.807
THE NUMBER OF SUICIDE --

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:32.642
DOES -- ONE

00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:35.712
OF THE I JUST AND JUST MARON

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.280
MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.148
AND BUT BUT ONE OF THE THE IN

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:40.984
SOME OF THE BACKUP MATERIAL WHAT

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.285
WE WILL BE SEEN AS SAID IN

00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:43.052
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.520
RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:45.688
SUICIDE RATE IS.

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:47.457
TWICE THE STATE AVERAGE THIS IS

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:49.826
ON IS IS THERE ON DOING STUDIES

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:51.094
TO DETERMINE.

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.729
THE OTHER STUDIES OUT THERE IS

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:53.963
WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:56.299
THAT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE IN

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.767
RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:59.602
AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:00.436
POPULATION.

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:01.404
I THINK IT'SIT'S ESSENTIALLY

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:03.006
THE SAME CONSTELLATION OF

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:05.475
FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING OPIOID

00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:07.010
USE AND AND OTHER ILLICIT DRUG

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:09.212
USE -- IT IS

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:14.550
A COMBINATION OF HAVING.

00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:17.787
A SICKLY SEEING NO WAY TO A

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:19.656
FUTURE WHERE YOU THRIVE TWO

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:20.857
PEOPLE ARE LIVING.

00:59:20.924 --> 00:59:22.358
BARELY MAKING.

00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:23.693
ENDS MEET.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.695
NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR

00:59:25.762 --> 00:59:26.296
CHILDREN WHAT THEY'D LIKE TO

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:27.563
PROVIDE.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.165
NOT HADN'T NOT BEING WHERE THEY

00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:30.867
THINK THEY SHOULD BE AT THAT

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:32.368
TIME OF LIFE AND SEEING NO WAY

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:33.836
OF GETTING BETTER.

00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:35.838
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHRONIC DISEASES

00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:38.408
IN PARTICULAR ALSO --

00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:40.576
IF THEY LOSE IF IF YOU IF YOU

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:41.577
DEVELOP A CHRONIC DISEASE THAT

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:42.979
CAUSES DISABILITY AS YOU WERE

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:43.846
MENTIONING EVEN TEMPORARY

00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:45.415
DISABILITY YOU CAN END UP LOSING

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:47.216
A JOB THAT WAS ALREADY TENUOUS

00:59:47.283 --> 00:59:48.084
TO BEGIN WITH AND NOW SUDDENLY

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:49.619
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE HOMELESS

00:59:49.686 --> 00:59:51.254
OR CLOSE TO HOMELESS UNSTABLE

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:52.055
HOUSE.

00:59:52.121 --> 00:59:55.325
ALL OF THOSE THINGS CONTRIBUTE

00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:59.295
TO FAIR AND WE THINK THAT THAT.

00:59:59.362 --> 01:00:01.431
IS NO ONE SINGLE FACTOR THERE

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:02.498
ARE A LOT OF THINGS CONTRIBUTING

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:03.399
TO IT --

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.134
WHAT WE DON'T THINK IS HAPPENING

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:07.070
IS INCREASE IN SORT OF ORGANIC

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.905
BRAIN DISEASE THAT'S LEADING TO

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.306
IS THERE FUNDAMENTALLY?

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:13.076
ISSUES WITH POVERTY AND A LACK

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:16.179
OF JOBS IN A WAY TO WAY OUT OF

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:17.213
WHERE THEY CURRENTLY ON

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.681
BASICALLY I GUESS WHAT AT POINT

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:20.483
A LACK OF SERVICES YES I HAVE.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.318
SERVICES IN MANY OF OUR COMMUTER

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:23.619
THIS IS THAT RECOGNIZE WHERE

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:26.055
PEOPLE ARE AT THAT TIME AND AND

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.557
PARTICULARLY WITH SPECIAL

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:28.758
POPULATIONS LIKE THE HOMELESS

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:29.726
POPULATION.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:30.693
WILL HAVE TO MEET THEM WHERE

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.261
THEY'RE OUT AND TAKE AND DRUG

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:33.696
USERS AS WELL.

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:35.531
TAKES TIME TO GET THEM ONTO A

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:37.734
PATH THAT SUSTAINABLE --

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.568
AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:42.672
SERVICE THAN SAY THE HEALTH CARE

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:46.709
SYSTEM IS ABLE TO PROVIDE.

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:50.079

PLEASURE.

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:02.925
BUT BUT I WAS INTERESTED IN YOUR

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.193
TERMINOLOGY USED HE SAID MUCH OF

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.329
WHAT YOU REPORT ON OUR SYMPTOMS

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:09.332
AND NOT THE ROOT CAUSES --

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:10.700
BASICALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:11.167
IS THAT.

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:12.135
THE DISEASE DISEASES LIKE

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:15.505
CHRONIC DISEASES AND BEHAVIORAL

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:16.939
HEALTH ISSUES.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:19.475
ARE SYMPTOMS OF THE ROOT CAUSES

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.978
OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD AND

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:26.082
COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES AND THE

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:27.917
INCREASING DIFFICULTY THAT

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.119
PEOPLE HAVE IT BAD FEELING LIKE

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.487
THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:32.722
LIVES.

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:33.156
IN.

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:34.657
IN I. E. AGREE WITH YOU THAT

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:39.495
MOST OF OUR UNMET NEED IS IN FOR

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:41.998
CHILDREN AS WELL AS COMMUNITIES.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:44.100
AND YET WE NEED SOME DATA POINTS

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.102
THAT WE CAN TRACK AND FOLLOW SO

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.036
THAT WE CAN MAKE INFORMED

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:48.738
DECISIONS.

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:50.239
SO WHEN YOU SAID THAT WE USE

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.774
INFORMATION TO SET PRIORITIES

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:54.477
AND TO DRIVE FOR ACTION.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.179
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT OUR

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:57.947
COMMITTEE IS ALSO TRYING TO DO.

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:00.783
AND THE ROLE OF THE STATE OF THE

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.419
STATE PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BE TO

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:05.021
HELP DRIVE US TOWARDS ACTION.

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.923
WHERE IT'S NEEDED THE MOST BASED

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:09.358
ON THE SYMPTOMS THAT YOU PRESENT

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:11.327
IN SO WE'RE WANTING TO PROVIDE

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.262
SOME QUESTIONS SO THAT WE CAN

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:15.264
HAVE RECURRING?

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.567
DATA STREAMS COME BACK TO US I

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:19.268
WELCOME THEM. FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:20.503
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS THAT YOU

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:21.771
BROUGHT UP.

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.072
NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL OF THOSE

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:25.174
COULD GENERAL SYPHILIS OCCURRED

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.008
IN FRESNO COUNTY IN THAT

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:28.578
BACKYARD EXACT AND SO I'M QUITE

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:30.246
AWARE OF SOME OF THESE DATA

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:31.614
STREAMS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT WE

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.649
HAVE TO DO A LARGER ROLE TO HELP

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:34.417
US TO DRIVE.

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.185
PUBLIC POLICY AND HOPE THAT THIS

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.120
CAN DO IT.

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.888
MY QUESTION REALLY IS WHAT CAN

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:41.090
WE DO FOR YOU FOR RESOURCES.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:43.092
HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:44.727
WHAT YOU NEED? TO DO THE

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:47.430
DIFFICULT TASK OF PROVIDING DATA

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:48.865
TO THIS BODY SO THAT WE CAN

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.766
ENSURE THAT --

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.635
WE CAN ACT UPON THAT INFORMATION

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.971
APPROPRIATELY.

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.172
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW HOW TO

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:58.708
ANSWER THAT QUESTION --

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.977
I THINK IT IS YOU KNOW HONESTLY

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:03.312
IN TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE A

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.547
STATE OF THE STATE.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.482
ADDRESS IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.017
WE'VE EVER DONE.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.385
WE HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW TO GO

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.921
ABOUT IT --

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:14.090
AND WE HAVE DONE SOME WORK AT

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.592
THE REQUEST OF THE COMMITTEE AND

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:17.894
THE LA -- ON

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.462
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE AND JUST IN

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:21.697
TERMS OF OF OF HUMAN RESOURCES

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:22.999
TO ACTUALLY --

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:24.834
DO THAT THE CHALLENGE BEING THE

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.802
VARIETY OF DATA THERE'S SO MUCH

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.371
DATA THAT WE CAN'T PRESENT TO IN

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:29.539
A SETTING LIKE THIS SO WE KNOW A

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:30.840
LOT ABOUT THOSE WOMEN WITH

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:32.108
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS THAT COULD

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:33.342
TELL US A LOT ABOUT WHAT THINGS

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:34.977
WE COULD PUT IN PLACE TO

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.179
ACTUALLY ADDRESS.

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.648
IT -- BUT

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:40.183
RENDON DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:41.551
WANT TO ADD ON THAT.

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:42.552
MISTER CHAIR READINESS FOR THE

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:44.287
DEPARTMENT SO. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:45.488
YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR DEPARTMENT

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.456
PRODUCES QUITE A FEW REPORTS ONE

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:48.457
OF THE THINGS AND IF YOU LOOK AT

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:49.559
THE BACK YOUR HAND OUT LISTED

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.093
ACROSS THE TOP OR A NUMBER OF

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.361
THOSE TYPES OF REPORTS THAT WE

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.263
DO PRODUCE. ONE OF THEM DOCTOR

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.865
SMITH MENTION WAS THE COUNTY

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:57.300
HEALTH STATUS PROFILES REPORT

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.435
WHEN WE WENT BACK AND JUST KIND

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.436
OF TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.671
QUESTION THOSE IN IN THE AGENDA

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:03.239
AS FAR AS WHAT WE WOULD NEED AN

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.907
RESOURCES WE LOOK AT WHAT SOME

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.342
OF THESE REPORTS CLASSES AND I'M.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:09.845
NOT ON A BI ANNUAL BASIS WE'RE

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:12.148
TO DO.

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.916
PROBABLY AROUND FIVE HUNDRED

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:14.717
THOUSAND GENERAL FUND AND THREE

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.352
POSITIONS WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:17.787
TO PULL IN THE RESOURCES OF THE

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:19.455
NEEDED TO DEVELOP. ONE OF THE

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.923
REASONS WE WERE LOOKING AT A BI

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.258
ANNUAL REPORT RATHER THAN AN

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:23.693
ANNUAL REPORT WAS BECAUSE IT

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:25.394
MIGHT PRODUCE YOU --

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:26.829
MORE COMPREHENSIVE INVALUABLE

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.097
REPORT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:30.199
HAVE TO DO WE HAVE AN ANNUAL CUT

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:32.268
OFF AS WE HAVE A REVIEW PROCESS

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.003
AND IT CUTS OFF THE ANALYSIS

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.504
TIME FRAME AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:38.341
PRESIDENT EXTENDED OUT THERE --

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:39.809
TO IT EVERY TWO YEAR REPORT

I'M SURE YOU'VE NOTED IN THE

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.223
DEFERRALS THAT THEY ISSUE TO US

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:48.891
WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:49.992

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:52.294
AS WELL AS THEY DID NOT ISSUE

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:53.896
DEFERRALS IN THE AMOUNTS THAT WE

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:54.964

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.300
MILLION DOLLARS WE DO HAVE SOME

01:08:58.367 --> 01:08:59.969

MORE TRANSPARENCY.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.152

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:24.213
MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE IT

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.315
PASSED TOJUNE.

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:27.516
YEAH AND THIS IS --

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:28.817
JENNIFER CAN --

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.519
I THINK THAT WE ARE WILLING TO

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:32.454
HAVE THE CONVERSATION I THINK

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:33.489
OBVIOUSLY WITH THE NEW

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:35.224
ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW SOME OF

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.993
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY RELATED TO THE

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:38.794
THE TRANSITION IT'S A

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:40.329
COMPLICATED TAX --

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:41.664
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE IN THE

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.232
LEGISLATURE THE LAST TIME THAT

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:44.800
THAT WE DID THIS BUT IT IS IT IS

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:48.037
SOMETHING THAT IS --

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:49.705
IT CAME FROM MERRY SPRAIN AN

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:51.240
EXCEL SPREADSHEET --

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:52.408
IT REQUIRES A LOT OF

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:53.742
CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:55.911
INDUSTRY ITSELF AS WELL AS THE

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.913
LEGISLATURE AS AND THEN THE

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:58.881
FINAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:00.349
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:01.650
WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:02.885
CONVERSATION --

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.153
AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY MORE THAN

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:05.220
HAPPY TO ENGAGEWITH YOUAND

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:07.289
OTHERS AS THE AS THE BUDGET YEAR

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:10.426
GOES ON I DIDN'T FEEL THE NEED

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.327
TO EXTRAPOLATE ANY FURTHER THAN

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:13.929
THE STAFF COMMENT OR QUESTION

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.964
THAT WE HAD REGARDING THE PUBLIC

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:17.666
CHARGING THE EFFECT THAT THIS IS.

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.001
HAPPENING BUT JUST THAT WE WILL

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:21.537
CONTINUE TO TRACKING TREND THAT

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:22.905
AND MONITORING.

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:24.106
I WANTED TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.574
IF I COULD ON MENTAL HEALTH THIS

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:28.911
YEAR AND JUST WANTED.

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:30.245
TO PUT THIS IN AS A PRIMER FOR

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:31.847
CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL HAVE

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:33.549
LATER ON IN THE YEAR.

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:35.617
BUT I'VE FOUND IT EASIER WHEN

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.119
YOU LISTEN MORE THAN YOU TALK

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:40.189
AND SO SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING.

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:41.957
TO ME THE OTHER DAY DURING A

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.026
MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUS THE AUTHOR

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.461
OF PROP SIXTY THREE DARRELL

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:46.762
STEINBERG SAID THAT THERE WERE

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.931
SOME THINGS HE THINKS.

01:12:48.997 --> 01:12:49.565
HE COULD HAVE DONE A LITTLE BIT

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:50.466
BETTER.

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.367
AND SO I'M INTERESTED IN WORKING

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:53.635
WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION TO

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:55.370
FIGURE OUT.

01:12:55.437 --> 01:12:57.573
WHAT POSSIBILITIES WE HAVE THIS

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:58.607
YEAR?

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:00.342
AND SO I HAVE BOTH SOME IDEAS

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:01.944
AND SOME QUESTIONS ACTUALLY FOR

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:02.745
THE LA --

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:03.912
BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW WHAT'S

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:06.215
QUITE POSSIBLE AND HOW FAR WE

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:07.382
CAN PUSH.

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:09.618
BUT LET ME START WITH THE IDEA

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.120
WHICH IS THAT EARLY INTERVENTION

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:12.688
AND PREVENTION SERVICES

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.389
CURRENTLY WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:17.059
DIFFERENT MODELS WE HAVE.

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:17.659
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT ARE

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:19.461
ALL DOING IT INDEPENDENTLY AND

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.230
DIFFERENTLY.

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:22.464
ARE THERE THAT MANY BEST

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:24.800
PRACTICES.

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:26.034
OR COULD WE COME UP WITH THE

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:28.804
HANDFUL OF SUGGESTIONS.

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:31.340
THAT WE PROMOTE TO THE COUNTIES

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:32.775
THAT HAVE.

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:35.477
DELIVERABLE METRICS AND OUTCOMES

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.179
THAT WE CAN FOLLOW.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.214
THAT WE CAN BRING BACK AND ALLOW

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:40.849
THE REGIONS ARE COUNTIES TO

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.584
SELECT THEMSELVES WHAT THEY

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.153
THINK IS BEST FOR THEIR OWN

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:45.254
COMMUNITIES.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.489
BUT BY DOING SUCH WERE ABLE TO

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:48.423
REALLY DRIVE TOWARDS EVIDENCE

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.592
BASED PRACTICES TOWARDS MODELS

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.728
THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND COULD BE

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.029
IMPLEMENTABLE.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.164
IN SEOUL WANTS --

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:58.233
TO WORK WITH THE ADMIN THE TERM

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.736
STEINBERG CAME UP TO US.

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.437
BUT ALSO TO SEE IF THE COUNTIES

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:04.206
THEMSELVES HAVE ANY SPECIFIC

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.608
IDEAS THAT ARE SEPARATE AND

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:08.310
APART THAN WHAT HE CAME UP WITH.

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:09.411
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:10.712
THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:11.914
COMMUNITIES.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.649
BUT BY DOING THAT I THINK WERE

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.551
BETTER ABLE TO ACTUALLY

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.386
INTERVENE EARLIER.

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:19.121
WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT GETS

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:21.123
US TO THE SECOND PART THAT HE

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:24.026
WE CAN CHANGE IT

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.594
BUT HE SAID 80% OF THE DOLLARS

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.229
WE SPEND IN PROP SIXTY THREE

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:29.298
GOES TOWARDS TREATMENT.

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:31.633
ONLY 20% TOWARDS EARLY

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.435
INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION.

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:36.839
IS THAT THE RIGHT RATIO.

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:40.642
IS THAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT.

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.678
COULD THERE BE A TRANSITION.

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:44.413
AND THAT'S WHERE I BELIEVE I

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:46.481
NEED THE LA YELLOWS AND PUT.

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:48.417
IN WILL WANT TO MEET WITH THEM

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:49.751
OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.486
HOPEFULLY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:53.255
OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.190
HOW WE COULD THINK ABOUT THAT

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.426
TYPE OF TRANSITION AND WHAT TYPE

01:14:57.492 --> 01:14:59.161
OF CHANGES WOULD BE NEEDED?

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:00.562
IS IT SOMETHING THAT WILL NEED

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:03.131
TO GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC.

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:04.867
FOR SINCE PROP SIXTY THREE WAS

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.134
INITIALLY PASSED.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:07.469
IS THAT A TWO THIRDS VOTE IS

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:09.605
THAT A MAJORITY VOTE THESE TYPES

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:10.939
OF QUESTIONS MATTER.

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:13.308
BUT AS WE START THINKING AND ARE

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.143
CONTEMPLATING WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:16.311
BOTH AND SUB.

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:18.046
ONE I WANTED TO TAKE THIS MOMENT

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:19.381
TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:22.251
I BELIEVE THE NEEDS TO CHANGE

01:15:22.317 --> 01:15:23.886
THE WAY WERE FUNDING IT. TO MAKE

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:26.088
SURE THAT WE CAN HELP TO PREVENT

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:26.889
DISEASE AND GET AHEAD OF THE

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:27.789
CURVE.

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:30.259
SO WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:32.561
HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN.

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:34.096
BUT WANTS TO WORK WITH BOTH THE

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:35.931
ADMINISTRATION AND LA --

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:39.067
AFTER THIS TO CONTINUE THE

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:40.602
SESSIONS.

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:41.169
WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:45.741
ISSUE.

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:46.341
THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:46.942
BECAUSE FOR BACK HEALTH CARE

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.810
SERVICES SO JUST AS A BIT OF

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:49.978
BACKGROUND AND GIVEN THE

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:52.247
SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES THAT WE'VE

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.016
SEEN IN THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE --

01:15:54.082 --> 01:15:55.417
WE INITIATED A DEPARTMENT WIDE

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:57.452
EFFORT. TO EVALUATE OUR

01:15:57.519 --> 01:15:59.054
RESOURCES ARE PROCESS SEASON ARE

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:01.490
SYSTEMS FOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT --

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:02.658
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.793
WRITE A LITTLE CONTEXT AS IS

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.094
MERRY MENTION MEDI CAL IS IN

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:07.729
OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:08.864
PROGRAM.

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.532
WHICH OVER THE YEARS HAS GROWN

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.100
BOTH IN SIZE AS WELL AS

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.703
COMPLEXITY WITHOUT COMMENSURATE

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.538
ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES OR

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:18.407
SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS TO KEEP UP

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.675
WITH THE PROGRAM.

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:20.943
ADDITIONALLY IT'S ON A CASH

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:22.544
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING SO TIMING OF

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:24.012
PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS ARE

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.781
CRITICAL AND SOMETIMES DIFFICULT

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.082
TO MANAGE --

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:29.885
IT'S WORTH NOTING A 1% --

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:32.321
VARIANCE IN OUR ESTIMATE IS A

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:34.056
BILLION DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:36.491
MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND SO

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:38.093
JUST JUST FOR CONTEXT --

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.496
SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES IN THE

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:43.098
ESTIMATE --

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:43.832
GROWTH IN OUR MANAGED CARE

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:44.733
PAYMENTS --

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:45.767
WE'VE GROWN TO APPROXIMATELY 80%

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:47.703
OF BENEFICIARIES ABOUT 50% OF

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:49.905
OUR PAYMENTS ARE TO MANAGE CARE

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:52.274
WHICH PUTS A LOT OF MONEY AND

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:54.076
RELATIVELY FEW PAYMENTS --

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:55.911
AND THERE ARE OPERATIONAL ISSUES

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:57.446
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE PAYMENTS

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:58.780
THERE ARE FEDERAL APPROVALS

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:00.549
ASSISTED WITH THOSE PAYMENTS SO

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.317
WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY.

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:04.319
IN ONE AREA AND ADDITIONALLY WE

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:05.754
HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.289
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT SO THINGS

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:09.257
LIKE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEES EVEN

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:11.927
THEM CO TAXES AS YOU TOUCHED ON

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:13.462
ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ARE

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:16.298
MORE THAN --

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:17.632
FORTY THEY CREATE COMPLEX

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:20.435
ACCOUNTING ISSUES AND TIMING

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.336
ISSUES THAT THAT CAN BE

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:22.671
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE.

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.673
I'M AS WELL AS ARE DRUG FREE BAY

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.575
AREA WHICH MERRY ALSO TOUCHED ON

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:27.776
AND WE HAVE SOME --

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.044
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:31.947
PROPOSING CARE THIS DRUG REBATES --

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:34.049
TOTAL ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:35.650
GENERAL FUND A YEAR.

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:36.885
AND THEY'RE REALLY DIFFICULT IN

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:38.520
TERMS OF THE TIMING --

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:40.288
WHEN THEY COME IN AND SOMETIMES

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.490
THEY JUST COME IN?

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:43.892
AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO TO ACCOUNT

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.160
FOR THEM.

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:46.895
SO IN TERMS OF OUR BUDGET CHANGE

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:49.498

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:16.751
REBATE FUN AND IT REALLY WOULD

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.120
SERVE AS A FISCAL MANAGEMENT

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:20.789

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.190
REBATES INTO THE DEPARTMENT WERE

BETTER ABLE TO MANAGE THE TIMING --

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.428
TO WHEN THEY OFFSET GENERAL FUND

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:27.863
EXPENDITURES.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:28.830
SO -- YOU

THAT ALL SPEAK --

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:34.903

COUPLED WITH EITHER --

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:41.109
INSUFFICIENT INADEQUATE OUTDATED

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:44.646
CREATE SIGNIFICANT SWINGS IN AND

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.648
OR CANS CREATE SIGNIFICANT

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:48.984
SWINGS IN IN THE ESTIMATE --

THE ESTIMATE --

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.760
BUT WE ARE WORKING TO ENHANCE

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:00.462
PROCESS SEES AN ON A LONGER TERM

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:02.631
BASIS THE SYSTEMS THAT WE USE TO

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.966
ACCOUNT FOR THOSE A HUNDRED

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:09.271
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:13.508
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OLEO.

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:15.844
ANALYST'S OFFICE --

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:17.279
IN OUR VIEW THE THE SWINGS IN

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:18.413
THE MEDICARE BUDGET THAT HAVE

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.148
BEEN REFERENCED ARE SERIOUS

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:21.616
CONCERN THAT --

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:23.451
MERIT SOME SOME ATTENTION FOR

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:24.853
TWO REASONS NUMBER.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.454
ONE THE SWINGS ARE VERY LARGE

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:26.955
AND THEY'VE BEEN IN BOTH

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:28.423
DIRECTIONS IT WASN'T VERY MANY

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:29.424
YEARS.

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:30.659
BACK THAT THERE WAS A

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.794
SIGNIFICANT UPWARD SWING IN --

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:33.728
ESTIMATED --

01:20:33.795 --> 01:20:35.463
TO MEDI CAL SPENDING AND THIS

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:36.264
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:38.466
LEGISLATURE TO HAVE LONG TERM

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:39.334
PLANNING.

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:41.536
AND SITS PRIORITIES CAN BE UPSET

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:43.638
BY CHANGING BASELINE NEEDS IN

01:20:43.705 --> 01:20:46.474
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM --

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:50.779
BUT BEYOND THAT AND AND WARRANTS --

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:52.414
CLOSE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BUT

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.415
THAT OVERSIGHT.

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.283
IS MADE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:57.118
COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAM --

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.787
OFTEN THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD

01:20:58.853 --> 01:21:01.489
BE NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY --

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:02.824
TRACKING INDEPENDENTLY OVERSEE

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:04.292
THE PROGRAM IS NOT PUBLICLY

01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:05.961
AVAILABLE --

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.896
AND IN SOME CASES IT FOR THE

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:10.398
DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE --

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:12.334
IN LIGHT OF ALL OF THIS WE THINK

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.102
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:16.438
STAFFING HAS MERIT AND WE RECKON

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.006
RECOMMEND THAT IT BE APPROVED --

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:19.507
HOWEVER WE SUGGEST THAT

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:20.809
INCREASED TRANSPARENCY FOR THE

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.844
LEGISLATURE AND OTHER EXTERNAL

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:24.045
STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD BE AN

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:25.714
ADDITIONAL PRIORITY --

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:29.551
AS THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSIDERED --

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:30.619
IN THE SHORT TERM WE WOULD

01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:31.620
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:33.488
DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:34.789
CARE SERVICES.

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:36.258
TO SHARE KEY INFORMATION THAT

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:37.392
WOULD BE GAINED.

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:38.860
FROM THE APPROVAL OF THESE

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:42.230
POSITIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE --

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:43.832
FOR EXAMPLE REGULAR UP UPDATES

01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:45.600
ON CASH FLOWS --

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:47.269
AND HOW THOSE COMPARE WITH --

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:48.970
BUDGET ESTIMATES SEEMS LIKE A

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:51.473
REASONABLE FIRST STEP THAT WE

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:53.208
THINK SHOULD BE EXPLORED --

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:55.644
SECOND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS --

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.412
MENTIONED THAT THIS IS JUST THE

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:58.880
FIRST STEP IN THAT THERE'S AN

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:00.915
ADDITIONAL PLANNING ON ON LARGER

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:02.884
MORE STRUCTURAL CHANGES OCCUR WE

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:05.186
COULD BE MADE AND WE WE AGREE

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:06.187
WITH THAT ASSESSMENT.

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:07.255
WE WOULD SUGGEST AND RECOMMEND

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:10.158
THE WHERE THE DEPARTMENT TO COME

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.827

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:14.696
OF STEPS THAT COULD BE TAKEN IN

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:15.864
THE FUTURE THIS WHAT ALLOWED

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:17.232
LET'S LET LEGISLATURE TO BE

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:18.633
INVOLVED --

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.302
INTO TO MAKE ITS PRIORITIES --

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:24.139
REFLECTED IN IN FUTURE CHANGES.

01:22:24.205 --> 01:22:25.774
ON THE PROPOSED DRUG REBATES

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.076
SPECIAL FRONT FUND WE THINK THIS

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:29.778
IS ALSO PROMISING CONCEPT --

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:30.679

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:45.306
THINK THAT'S A WORTHWHILE --

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:45.873
ENDEAVOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:48.976
ENGAGING --

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:50.778
THE COINCIDING WITH THE

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:51.412
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROS TO WE

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:52.113
ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:52.814
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.248
SERVICES CONSIDER COMPLIANCE

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:55.716
MONITORING --

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:57.218
SPECIFICALLY THE USE OF A

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.619
DESIGNATED CPT CODE --

01:30:58.686 --> 01:30:59.587
COUPLED WITH SOME PROVIDER

01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:00.855
TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:02.790
SUCCESS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:03.658
TRAUMA SCREENING IS UNIVERSAL

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.393
ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS THERE ARE

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:07.628
SOME DISCREPANCIES AT COUNTY

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:08.963
ADMINISTRATION LEVEL TODAY.

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.764
FINALLY WE HAD MULTIPLE

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:11.332
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:12.633
OF SCREENING --

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.335
FOR ACES IN ADULTS --

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:14.869
AND THE INTER GENERATIONAL

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:17.104
IMPACT ON THE TRUMP HAS AYE KIDS

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:18.606
IN THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THAT

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:19.941
SO WE THINK THAT THE NEXT STEP

01:31:20.007 --> 01:31:21.042
THAT THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.009
COULD UNDERTAKE.

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:23.110
IS TO ALSO EXAMINE BEYOND THE

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:25.379
SCOPE OF CHILDREN.

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:27.815
AB THREE FORTY THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:28.349
DOING TRAUMA SCREENINGS IN

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:29.584
ADULTS.

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:30.418
FOLLOWING UP TO THOSE

01:31:30.484 --> 01:31:31.786
RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE --

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:33.821
WE HAVE A FEW OTHER IDEAS FOR

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:34.121
YOU -- BASED

01:31:34.188 --> 01:31:35.723
ON OUR CONVERSATIONS ON THE EP

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:37.558
STT BENEFIT --

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:38.326
WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:40.361
DOCTORS MISS OPENING COMMENTS ON

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:41.028
THE STATE OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:42.096
HEALTH.

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:43.598
SO EXTREMELY BROAD BENEFIT I'M

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:45.066
WORKING ON INTERVENTIONS FOR

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:46.767
TRAUMA FORCES THE OPPORTUNITY IN

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:47.835
GREAT PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:49.370

REALISTICALLY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:31:52.306 --> 01:31:53.774
IF WE IMPROVE DRAMA SCREENINGS

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:55.476
ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN ARE

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:56.143
PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:57.812
PREDICT MONITOR AND THEN PROVIDE

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.247
TREATMENT FOR THE MANIFESTATIONS

01:31:59.313 --> 01:32:00.615
OF TRAUMA DIFFERENT LEVELS IN

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.416
PLACES ACROSS THE HEALTHCARE

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:04.252
SYSTEM. ONE OF THE KEY NEXT

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:04.785
STEPS THAT WE BELIEVE IS

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:06.287
IMPRISONMENT IMPROVING THIS

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:07.755
PROCESS IS TO MAKE SURE THE

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:09.390
PROVIDERS ARE WELL TRAINED ON

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:10.358
FROM THE SCREENINGS.

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:11.726
THIS CAN INCLUDE HOW TO PROVIDE

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:12.960
FROM IN FRONT CARE WHEN THEY'RE

01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:14.262

AND WHAT THE WHAT THE

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.401
APPROPRIATE REFERRALS OR

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:22.036
INTERVENTIONS MIGHT BE TO HELP

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:23.037
ADDRESS CHILDHOOD TRAUMA.

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:24.472
ADDITIONALLY ADVOCATES RECOMMEND

01:32:24.538 --> 01:32:25.640
THAT THE LEGISLATURE EXPOSED THE

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:26.874
POTENTIAL OR EXPLORE THE

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:28.342
POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS WHEN IT

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:29.610
COMES TO EXPANDING THE ACTUAL

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:30.878
SERVICES THE TRAUMA VICTIMS

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:32.079
RECEIVE.

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:34.582
THIS WOULD REQUIRE --

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:37.652
DIFFERENT BY ARE THE VARIABLES

HAVE A NET POSITIVE IMPACT ON

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:51.432

THE CENTER AND USE WHILE THIS

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:28.636
BACK IN THE DAY --

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:31.105

TRAUMA SCREENS IN THE IN THE

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:05.406

I HAVE I HAVE TOLD PEOPLE THAT

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:10.044
ONE OF THE MORE NOTABLE --

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:12.046
COMMENTS FROM ONE OF THE PUBLIC

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:12.646

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:13.881
DIRECTORS --

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:15.549
FROM SHASTA COUNTY WAS THE

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:17.084
RECOGNITION THAT --

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:18.519
A LOT OF THE ADULT POPULATION OF

01:34:18.586 --> 01:34:20.621
THEIR THAT THEY HAVE FOUND --

01:34:20.688 --> 01:34:21.856
IT'S AN ENERGY IT'S A IT'S A

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:24.125
GENERATIONAL THING AND YOU CAN'T

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:26.327
ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:27.728
CHILDREN BEING IMPACTED UNLESS

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:28.929
YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:30.564
ADULTS I THINK THAT.

01:34:30.631 --> 01:34:33.000
SOME OF THE NATURE OF THAT --

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:34.535
IMPORTANCE WAS --

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:35.503
CARRIED FORWARD IN THE

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:37.304
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SO

01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:38.172
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT IT BOTH

TODAY AS WELL AS IN MENTAL

01:34:40.074 --> 01:34:40.875
HEALTH --

01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:42.576
DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE BEING --

01:34:42.643 --> 01:34:45.880
HEARD -- TO

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:48.149
MISSION AND THE PROPOSAL BEFORE

01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:49.850
THE LEGISLATURE TO DO TRAUMA

01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:51.252
SCREENINGS FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:53.087
ADULTS POPULATIONS --

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:54.655
I THINK IS INDICATIVE OF THE

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:55.956
ADMINISTRATION'S INTEREST IN

01:34:56.023 --> 01:34:57.491
GETTING --

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:58.993
TO NOT ONLY DOING THE SCREEN BUT

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.461
THE BROADER CONVERSATION IS IS

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.129
ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THE SCREENING --

01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:03.230
WHAT ARE THE SERVICES AND OTHER

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:04.632
OPTIONS THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:06.067
THAT WE'RE KIND OF --

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:07.168
DOING A LOT MORE EARLY

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:08.269
INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION

01:35:08.335 --> 01:35:10.938
ACTIVITIES AS YOU NOTED EARLIER --

01:35:11.005 --> 01:35:14.208
I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT --

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:16.077
AGAIN I'M KIND OF GETTING INTO

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:17.578
THE PROP FIFTY SIX AGENDA ITEM

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:19.947
BEFORE WE GET THEIR OFFICIALLY

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:21.148
IS THAT THE VALUE BASED

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:23.117
PURCHASING PROPOSAL THAT IS IN

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:24.218
THE GOVERNOR'S --

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:26.987
BUDGET ALSO CONTAINS --

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.422
IDEAS AND INCENTIVES AROUND

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:30.057
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION AS

01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:31.692
WELL AS OTHER ITEMS AND SO I

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:34.228
THINK WE ARE SAYING THAT --

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:35.729
THE TRAUMA SCREENS ARE AN

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:37.698
IMPORTANT FIRST COMPONENT BUT I

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.533
THINK AS MR BATRES IS CERTAINLY

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.502
INDICATED IS THAT ONCE A PERSON

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.403
ADMITS.

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:44.472
ON A SCREENING TOOL THAT THEY

01:35:44.538 --> 01:35:46.874
HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO QUESTION IS

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:47.975
AS WELL WHAT DO I DO WITH THAT

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:49.276
PERSON AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

01:35:49.343 --> 01:35:51.345
DO AND SO I THINK THAT IS OF A

01:35:51.412 --> 01:35:53.447
POLICY DISCUSSION THAT WE AS A

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:55.015
STATE HAVE TO HAVE IN TERMS OF

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:56.150
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS.

01:35:56.217 --> 01:35:57.451
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO

01:35:57.518 --> 01:35:59.053
CERTAINLY HAPPY TO BE A PART OF

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.122
THAT BUT REALLY WANTED TO SAY

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:03.157
THAT THE WORKGROUP WAS DOES --

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:05.059
ILLUSTRATIVE AND VERY POSITIVE

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:06.193
IN COLLABORATIVE AND I THINK

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:08.429
THAT WE WERE --

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:09.063
WITH PLEASE WITH THE OUTCOME OF

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:12.666

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:15.569
LET'S SEE.

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:16.570
I'M.

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:17.204
WITH THAT WILL BRING IT UP TO

01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:18.239
THE DIES FOR ANY COMMENTS OR

01:36:18.305 --> 01:36:20.374
QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE.

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:22.643

PRACTICE AND AND WHAT WHAT KIND

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:49.663
OF CARE DO THEY PROVIDE IN TERMS

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:50.864
OF CARE SOURCE.

01:42:50.931 --> 01:42:52.032

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:53.734
GUARANTEE THAT THEY ARE --

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.235
EMBEDDED IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:56.703
AND AND CERTAINLY ABLE TO STAY

01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:57.671
WITH US --

01:42:57.738 --> 01:42:59.239
FOR THE LONG HAUL SO --

01:42:59.306 --> 01:43:00.908
THERE IS A B. C. P. THAT I WILL

01:43:00.974 --> 01:43:03.110
JUST QUICKLY REFERENCE WHERE WE

01:43:03.176 --> 01:43:04.811
ARE SEEKING EIGHTEEN POSITIONS.

01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:05.579
AND APART AND THREE MILLION

01:43:05.646 --> 01:43:06.680
DOLLARS --

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.248
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN PROP

01:43:08.315 --> 01:43:09.616
FIFTY SIX FUNDS AND ONE POINT

01:43:09.683 --> 01:43:11.451
FIVE MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS.

01:43:11.518 --> 01:43:12.953
TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE NEW --

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.422
VALUE BASED PURCHASING --

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:17.124
INITIATIVE THIS IS A LOT MORE --

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:20.460
INTENSIVE A FEW TEENS TO SETTING

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:22.129
UP THE METRICS --

01:43:22.195 --> 01:43:23.030
THAT THE PLANS WILL BE WORKING

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:23.764
WITH PROVIDERS ON AN

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:25.499
INDIVIDUALIZED BASIS AS WELL AS

ACTUAL IN SOME OF THESE ARE NOT

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:29.002
ONE YEAR.

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:30.170
KIND OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS

01:43:30.237 --> 01:43:31.405
WHERE WE HAVE JUST --

01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:33.273
TRADITIONALLY ATTACHED A DOLLAR

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.809

CODE IT THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:40.647
GENERATED AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:41.715
AMOUNT --

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:43.050
VALUE BASED PURCHASING IS A LOT

01:43:43.116 --> 01:43:44.551
MORE TIME INTENSIVE BECAUSE

01:43:44.618 --> 01:43:45.786
YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE

01:43:45.852 --> 01:43:47.220
MUCH MORE GRANULAR LEVEL IN

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:48.388
TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE QUALITY.

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:49.323
SCORES AND WHAT'S THE

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:50.457
IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME IN THOSE

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:51.858
PROVIDERS AND HOW DO WE PROVIDE

01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:53.226
THOSE INCENTIVES AND SO.

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:54.528
CERTAINLY WE NEED THE ADDITIONAL

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:56.363
RESOURCES INTERNALLY IN ORDER TO

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:57.731
KIND OF DO THAT IN A LONG TERM

01:43:57.798 --> 01:43:59.900
BASIS AND COMMITTED TO WORKING

01:43:59.967 --> 01:44:00.500
WITH.

01:44:00.567 --> 01:44:01.802
THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:03.470
ON HOW THOSE ARE GOING TO BE

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:04.871
DESIGNED IN THE METHODOLOGY IN

01:44:04.938 --> 01:44:06.607
THE FUNDING AND DOLLAR AMOUNTS

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:07.307
ARE CERTAINLY --

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:08.241
DETAILS THAT WERE GOING TO BE

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:09.509
WORKING ON THROUGH THIS BUDGET

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:12.012
PROCESS SO HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:18.552
QUESTIONS.

01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:19.686
ANY COMMENTS BERMAN FINANCE

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:24.057
EARLIER.

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:25.592
I JUST THINK IT'S DEPARTMENT OF

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:26.927
FINANCE WILL ALLOW THE LA A

01:44:26.994 --> 01:44:30.230
COMMENT AND WE MAY I RESPOND

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:30.831
SHOULD THAT BE NECESSARY THANK

01:44:30.897 --> 01:44:34.735
YOU.

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:35.502
HI BEN JOHNSON WITH THE

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:36.803
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE --

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:37.971
ON FRIDAY WE RELEASED AN

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:40.173
ANALYSIS OF THE USE OF

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.808
PROPOSITION --

01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:43.243
FIFTY SIX FUNDING IN MEDI CAL TO

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:46.446
IMPROVE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE --

01:44:46.513 --> 01:44:48.115
THE REPORT REALLY FOCUSES I

01:44:48.181 --> 01:44:52.419
THINK ON BOTH THE NEW PER --

01:44:52.486 --> 01:44:54.087
BY THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS

01:44:54.154 --> 01:44:56.556
ON THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES UP OF

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:58.058
NO PAYMENTS AS THEY SORT OF

01:44:58.125 --> 01:45:00.594
INTERACT WITH MANAGED CARE WE

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:02.529
FOCUS ON ON THOSE PAYMENTS

01:45:02.596 --> 01:45:03.997
BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:05.465
BENEFICIARIES GATE GET THEIR

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:06.867
CARE THROUGH.

01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:09.836
MANAGED CARE AND IT HAS THE THE

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:12.005
CLOSEST NEXUS OF SORT OF A SORT

01:45:12.072 --> 01:45:13.140
OF A INTERACTION.

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:15.475
WHAT WE DO WHAT WE FELT WE WE

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:16.910
BREAK OUR REPORT DOWN INTO KIND

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:19.146
OF TWO DIFFERENT PARTS ONE IS

01:45:19.212 --> 01:45:20.647
ASSESSING HOW PROVIDER

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:22.416
REIMBURSEMENT WORKS WITHIN

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:23.984
MANAGE CARE AND SORT OF HOW?

01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:25.719
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PAYMENTS

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:26.787
LATER ON TO THAT.

01:45:26.853 --> 01:45:28.922
AND WE ALSO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:31.858
OF HOW ACCESS AND QUALITY --

01:45:31.925 --> 01:45:33.560
ARE MEASURED WITHIN MEDI CAL

01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:36.063
MANAGED CARE AND THEN FINALLY WE

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:38.198
TRY TO BRING THOSE TWO TOGETHER

01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:39.166
TO ASSESS --

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:40.901
THE APPROPRIATENESS OR THAT THE

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:43.003
SORT OF THE THE PROMISE OF

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.838
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:45.672
SPECIFICALLY FOR PHYSICIAN

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:46.540
PAYMENTS --

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:50.577
IN IMPROVING THAT QUALITY SO.

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:52.713
FIRST WE FIND THAT MANAGED CARE

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:55.649
PLANS DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY.

01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:57.484
TO SET PROVIDER PAYMENTS --

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:59.653
ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LOCAL

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.421
HEALTH CONDITIONS AND NEEDS --

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:01.922
THEY GET FUNDING THROUGH

01:46:01.988 --> 01:46:05.292
CAPITATED AND THEN THEY CAN SET

01:46:05.358 --> 01:46:07.027
THEIR PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:08.128
LEVELS --

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:12.065
ACCORDINGLY --

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:13.667
ON THE ACCESS AND QUALITY.

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:16.703
SIDE WE FIND THAT OVERALL THERE

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:18.205
AND THERE'S NO --

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:20.874
SORT OF WIDESPREAD EVIDENCE OF

01:46:20.941 --> 01:46:22.642
NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE'S

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:25.145
ACCESSING QUALITY STANDARDS --

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:27.948
GENERALLY THE MANAGED CARE PLANS

01:46:28.014 --> 01:46:30.117
DO MEET THE TIME AND DISTANCE

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:31.418
STANDARDS THAT THE STATE HAS --

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:34.054
BEEN IMPOSING IN RECENT YEARS --

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:35.889
BUT WE DO FIND THAT THERE IS

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:37.424
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. FOR

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:39.693
EXAMPLE WHILE MANAGED CARE PLANS

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:43.330
SEEM TO PHASE RELATIVELY --

01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:45.365
A LESSER AMOUNT OF DIFFICULTY

01:46:45.432 --> 01:46:47.534
FOR EXAMPLE RECRUITING PRIMARY

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:49.503
CARE PHYSICIANS THEY DO FACE

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:51.872
GREATER CHALLENGES IN RECRUITING --

01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:53.707
SPECIALIST PRIMARILY --

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.208
PEDIATRIC SPECIALIST IN

01:46:55.275 --> 01:46:57.077
LOCATIONS THAT ARE CLOSE TO

01:46:57.144 --> 01:46:58.311
WHERE THEIR MEMBERS ULTIMATELY

01:46:58.378 --> 01:46:59.546
LEFT.

01:46:59.613 --> 01:47:01.214
WE ALSO FIND THAT THERE'S A

01:47:01.281 --> 01:47:03.950
LARGE VERY BILL COMMENTS ON THE

01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:06.319
QUALITY METRICS THAT THE STATE --

01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:08.789
THAT THE STATE IMPOSES AS WELL

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:10.824
AS GENERAL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:12.793
ON IN TERMS OF MEMBER

01:47:12.859 --> 01:47:14.628
SATISFACTION WITH THE CARE THAT

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:16.463
THEY RECEIVE THROUGH --

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:19.232
THROUGH THEIR MANAGED CARE PLANS.

01:47:19.299 --> 01:47:21.902
TURNING TO THE PROPOSITION FIFTY

01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:23.370
SIX SIDE WE FIND THAT THE

01:47:23.436 --> 01:47:24.738
PHYSICIAN SERVICES PROVIDER

01:47:24.805 --> 01:47:26.673
PAYMENT INCREASES REALLY APPLY A

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:29.176
UNIFORM AND STATEWIDE --

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:30.811
SOLUTION TO POTENTIAL

01:47:30.877 --> 01:47:32.145
DEFICIENCIES IN ACCESSING

01:47:32.212 --> 01:47:34.748
QUALITY THAT REALLY VERY --

01:47:34.815 --> 01:47:36.316
BY MANAGED CARE PLAN AND IN

01:47:36.383 --> 01:47:37.851
VARIOUS DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:38.785
STATE.

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:40.520
SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY THINK

01:47:40.587 --> 01:47:41.822
THAT THE EXISTING APPROACH IS

01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:43.557
SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO MEET

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:45.559
THOSE VERY ABLE --

01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:47.327
HEALTH CARE NEEDS --

01:47:47.394 --> 01:47:48.962
MOREOVER WE FIND THAT THE

01:47:49.029 --> 01:47:50.197
EXISTING SO --

01:47:50.263 --> 01:47:51.765
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS.

01:47:51.832 --> 01:47:53.767
GENERALLY TARGET NON SPECIALTY

01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:56.136
SERVICES WHEREAS IN OUR

01:47:56.203 --> 01:47:58.071
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF WHERE

01:47:58.138 --> 01:48:00.106
THERE IS --

01:48:00.173 --> 01:48:02.309
SAY WHERE BENEFICIARIES I'M TO

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:07.214
SEE A THAT THAT HE CONCENTRATED

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.383
IN VERY SPECIALTIES.

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:12.719
ULTIMATELY WE WE RAISE CONCERNS

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:13.887
THAT THE GOVERNOR STATES AND

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:15.655
INTEND TO MAKE THE EXISTING

01:48:15.722 --> 01:48:17.624
PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES --

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:19.459
PERMANENT DESPITE NOT HAVING

01:48:19.526 --> 01:48:21.361
RELEASED AN EVALUATION SHOWING

01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:23.697
THEIR IMPACT ON ACCESS AND

01:48:23.763 --> 01:48:26.266
QUALITY IN INITIAL CONVERSATIONS

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.235
AND AND DEBATE OVER --

01:48:28.301 --> 01:48:30.737
OVER HOW TO USE PROPOSITION

01:48:30.804 --> 01:48:31.838
FIFTY SIX FUNDING --

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:33.173
WE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.407
THERE WAS A COMMITMENT TO

01:48:34.474 --> 01:48:35.976
PERFORMING THAT ANALYSIS AND

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:37.477
WE'D WANT TO SEE THAT --

01:48:37.544 --> 01:48:39.880
SEE THAT ANALYSIS BEFORE THEY

01:48:39.946 --> 01:48:41.581
ARE MADE PERMANENT.

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:42.883
FINALLY NOTE THAT GIVEN

01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:44.317
PROJECTED REVENUES AND THE

01:48:44.384 --> 01:48:46.486
PROPOSED LEVEL OF SPENDING UNDER

01:48:46.553 --> 01:48:48.388
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL --

01:48:48.455 --> 01:48:50.423
WE WE DO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:52.192
THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PROVIDER

01:48:52.259 --> 01:48:53.193
PAYMENT INCREASES UNDER

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:55.428
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX USING ONLY

01:48:55.495 --> 01:48:57.898
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING --

01:48:57.964 --> 01:49:00.901
THE LEVEL PROPOSED IN --

01:49:00.967 --> 01:49:01.534
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IT BY A

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:03.837
SMALL AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE LEVEL

01:49:03.904 --> 01:49:06.406
OF FUNDING FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:07.908
SIX THAT'S DEDICATED. TO MEDI

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:10.277
CAL AND WE WOULD EXPECT THIS TO

01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:11.945
BE A DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:14.147
GOING FORWARD SO THERE COULD BE --

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:15.916
THERE COULD BE NEED IF WE KEPT

01:49:15.982 --> 01:49:17.684
IF THINGS WERE --

01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:19.619
IF IT WERE JUST HELD FORWARD AND

01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:21.454
AND SUSTAINED IN TERMS OF THE

01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:24.157
PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES THERE

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:24.758
COULD BE NEED FOR SOME GENERAL

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:25.959
FUND.

01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:27.761
OVERALL WE JUST WE PROVIDE

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:30.030
SEVERAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION

01:49:30.096 --> 01:49:31.998
AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:33.133
WHAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:34.434
EXISTING PROVIDER PAYMENT

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:35.702
INCREASES SHOULD BE FURTHER

01:49:35.769 --> 01:49:36.970
ASSESSED BEFORE THEY ARE MADE

01:49:37.037 --> 01:49:39.372
PERMANENT AND RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:49:39.439 --> 01:49:41.107
LEGISLATURE DIRECT H. YES TO

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:43.009
REPRODUCE SO PRO REPORT ON THEIR

01:49:43.076 --> 01:49:44.411
IMPACTS AND --

01:49:44.477 --> 01:49:46.846
IMPACT ON ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE

01:49:46.913 --> 01:49:48.181
FIND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:49.582
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER --

01:49:49.649 --> 01:49:50.884
THE GOVERNOR'S VALUE BASED

01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:53.119
PAYMENT PROPOSAL AS WE DO

01:49:53.186 --> 01:49:54.621
BELIEVE THAT IT DOES TARGET

01:49:54.688 --> 01:49:56.756
AREAS WITH SOME DEFICIENCIES IN

01:49:56.823 --> 01:49:58.591
MEDI CAL AND WE FIND THAT PAYING

01:49:58.658 --> 01:50:01.227
FOR OUTCOMES AS OPPOSED --

01:50:01.294 --> 01:50:03.063
TO SERVICE UTILIZATION --

01:50:03.129 --> 01:50:05.265
IS A PROMISING APPROACH --

01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:06.299
TO IMPROVING CARE WITHIN MEDI

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:08.335
CAL IN SO FAR AS THE GOVERNOR'S

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:09.903
PROPOSAL IS --

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.237
APPROVED WE DO THINK THAT THE

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:13.073
STATE OPERATIONS RESOURCES WOULD

01:50:13.139 --> 01:50:14.307
BE -- WOULD

01:50:14.374 --> 01:50:15.809
BE APPROPRIATE --

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:17.210
THAT SAID WE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.611
OF DETAIL ON THE NEW PROPOSED

01:50:18.678 --> 01:50:19.980
PAYMENTS AND SO WE'D BE LOOKING

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.281
FORWARD --

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:22.082
TO SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL

01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:24.317
DETAIL AS THE BUDGET PROCESS

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:25.552
CONTINUES.

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:27.287
FINALLY WE WE DO RECOMMEND

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:28.254
REJECTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:29.956
PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS

01:50:30.023 --> 01:50:31.224
FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:32.859
WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS

01:50:32.926 --> 01:50:33.593
IS -- THAT

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:35.528
THE IDENTIFICATION TREATMENT OF

01:50:35.595 --> 01:50:37.030
INDIVIDUAL OF CHILDREN WITH

01:50:37.097 --> 01:50:38.631
DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS IS A WORTHY

01:50:38.698 --> 01:50:40.700
GOAL WE DO NT BELIEVE THAT THE

01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:42.202
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:43.503
COST EFFECTIVE.

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:46.106
APPROACH TO SOLVING THIS ISSUE --

01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:47.640
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS ARE

01:50:47.707 --> 01:50:49.509
CURRENTLY REQUIRED WITHIN MEDI

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:51.811
CAL AND FUNDED THROUGH MANAGED

01:50:51.878 --> 01:50:54.147
CARE AS WELL AS FEE FOR SERVICE

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:55.749
AND WE DO THINK THAT OTHER COST

01:50:55.815 --> 01:50:57.183
EFFECTIVE APPROACHES SUCH AS

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:58.618
IMPROVING THE STATE'S

01:50:58.685 --> 01:50:59.986
ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING

01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:00.887
REQUIREMENTS.

01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:02.188
AS WELL AS OTHER POTENTIAL

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:04.124
SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE TRIED BEFORE

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:06.159
PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:07.427
SO -- THAT

01:51:07.494 --> 01:51:09.896
CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BY ANY

01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:12.165
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:13.133

01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:17.163
THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS

01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:19.099

OBVIOUSLY IF THE SCREENS AREN'T

01:52:41.087 --> 01:52:42.789

DELAYS.

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:14.287
THERE'S FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:15.889
TESTING THAT OCCURS AND THEN IF

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:17.657

02:01:23.976 --> 02:01:25.911
IT'S THE REIMBURSEMENT IS LESS

02:01:25.978 --> 02:01:27.580
THAN SEVENTEEN DOLLARS

02:01:27.647 --> 02:01:27.880
[inaudible]

02:01:33.319 --> 02:01:35.154
NOW PAINTING THE PICTURE IMAGINE

THAT WE HAVE TO HIRE NURSES AND

02:01:36.956 --> 02:01:38.290
PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND

02:01:38.357 --> 02:01:39.825
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS.

02:01:39.892 --> 02:01:41.694
ARE REGULATIONS GET.

02:01:41.761 --> 02:01:43.929
MORE HEAVY THE ACUITY OF THE

02:01:43.996 --> 02:01:45.665
PEOPLE THAT WERE SERVING GOES UP

02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:46.599
WHEN I STARTED WE HAD A THREE

02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:47.433
PAGE.

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:49.135
INDIVIDUAL PLAN OF CARE WE NOW

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:50.970
HAVE AN EIGHTEEN PAGE INDIVIDUAL

02:01:51.037 --> 02:01:52.438
PLAN OF CARE.

02:01:52.505 --> 02:01:55.141
SO ARE BURDEN INCREASES.

02:01:55.207 --> 02:01:56.709
THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION HAS

02:01:56.776 --> 02:01:58.411
DOUBLED SINCE I STARTED THE COST

02:01:58.477 --> 02:01:59.779

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:05.017
REQUIREMENT.

02:02:05.084 --> 02:02:06.585
SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:08.254
ADDITION TO RESTORING THAT RATE

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.790

02:21:23.007 --> 02:21:24.075
HOSPITAL BASED PHYSICIANS WHEN

02:21:24.142 --> 02:21:26.444
THE THRESHOLD OF VISITS IN THAT

02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:26.978
QUARTER EXCEEDS A CERTAIN

02:21:27.045 --> 02:21:28.580
PERCENTAGE.

02:21:28.646 --> 02:21:30.215
IN MANY MORE THAN AND MANY

02:21:30.281 --> 02:21:31.850
MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS

02:21:31.916 --> 02:21:33.184
THESE HOSPITAL BASED PHYSICIANS

02:21:33.251 --> 02:21:34.385
PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES TO

02:21:34.452 --> 02:21:35.620
MEDI CAL PATIENTS WHO HAVE NO

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:36.654
OTHER CARE ACCESS POINTS

02:21:36.721 --> 02:21:38.089
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND SHOULD NOT

02:21:38.156 --> 02:21:39.991
BE EXCLUDED FROM INCENTIVES TO

02:21:40.058 --> 02:21:41.826
IMPROVE OR MAINTAIN ACCESS.

02:21:41.893 --> 02:21:43.428
THE INCENTIVE CRITERIA WOULD BE

02:21:43.494 --> 02:21:44.863
DESIGNED MY DH CS IN CONJUNCTION

02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:45.763
WITH CURRENT REGIONAL

02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:47.365
UTILIZATION DATA IN ORDER TO

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:48.700
ENSURE PROVIDERS PRACTICING IN

02:21:48.766 --> 02:21:50.435
THESE IMPORTANT SAFETY NET

02:21:50.501 --> 02:21:52.136
SETTINGS CONTINUE TO DO SO.

02:21:52.203 --> 02:21:53.638
THS MAY BE ABLE TO BE INCLUDED

02:21:53.705 --> 02:21:54.405
OTHER VALUE BASED PAYMENT

02:21:54.472 --> 02:21:55.874
PROGRAM AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:59.410
WORKING WITH PCS FOR THE DETAILS

02:21:59.477 --> 02:21:59.978
ON TO TOP DESIGNING THIS NEW

02:22:00.044 --> 02:22:04.883
PROGRAM.

02:22:04.949 --> 02:22:05.383
SO.

02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:08.152
I WE RECENTLY LEARNED --

02:22:08.219 --> 02:22:09.787
AND OPPOSE --

02:22:09.854 --> 02:22:12.557
A PROPOSAL BY CMS TO COLLAPSE

02:22:12.624 --> 02:22:13.691
TEN EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

02:22:13.758 --> 02:22:15.260
CODES SOME OF WHICH WE CURRENTLY

02:22:15.326 --> 02:22:16.661
SUPPLEMENT.

02:22:16.728 --> 02:22:17.762
SO WE SUGGEST TRAILER BILL

02:22:17.829 --> 02:22:19.297
LANGUAGE ALLOWING DH CS TO

02:22:19.364 --> 02:22:21.165
REASSIGN REASSESS CODES AFFECTED

02:22:21.232 --> 02:22:23.735
BY THIS POTENTIAL CHANGE WITHOUT

02:22:23.801 --> 02:22:25.370
A TRIGGER FOR AN ACCESS STUDY.

02:22:25.436 --> 02:22:27.372
THE COULD COLLAPSE WILL RESULT

02:22:27.438 --> 02:22:28.439
IN REDUCED PAYMENT.

02:22:28.506 --> 02:22:29.574
ESSENTIALLY IS THERE OR NO

02:22:29.641 --> 02:22:30.975
PAYMENT FOR SOME CODES BECAUSE

02:22:31.042 --> 02:22:33.578
IT WILL ELIMINATE THEM BUT PROP

02:22:33.645 --> 02:22:34.212
FIFTY SIX A MEDIC HOW WILL STILL

02:22:34.279 --> 02:22:35.713
BE PAYING THEM.

02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:36.314
JUST CONDENSED UNDER DIFFERENT

02:22:36.381 --> 02:22:37.482
CODE.

02:22:37.548 --> 02:22:38.816
SO SEE ME THINKING IS THAT WE

02:22:38.883 --> 02:22:40.218
DON'T WANT TO MAKE DH CS TO AN

02:22:40.285 --> 02:22:41.552
ACCESS STUDY AT GREAT COST IF

02:22:41.619 --> 02:22:43.087
THE SERVICE REALLY IS NOT BEING

02:22:43.154 --> 02:22:44.822
ELIMINATED OR PAYMENT IS NOT BE

02:22:44.889 --> 02:22:45.957
REDUCED.

02:22:46.024 --> 02:22:47.592
ITS BEING RENAMED.

02:22:47.659 --> 02:22:49.294
A CO CLASS OF THIS NATURE HAS

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.828
NOT BEEN ENACTED BUT CMS IS

02:22:50.895 --> 02:22:52.563
PURSUING IT FOR TWENTY TWENTY

02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:53.665
AND IS FACING GREAT OPPOSITION

02:22:53.731 --> 02:22:54.832
FROM THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY.

02:22:54.899 --> 02:22:56.334
COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO PROTECT

02:22:56.401 --> 02:22:58.202
WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE --

02:22:58.269 --> 02:22:59.904
THUS FAR [inaudible]

02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:02.340
LASTLY CMA SUGGEST THAT ANY NEW

02:23:02.407 --> 02:23:04.575

DENNIS ACROSS THE STATE --

02:23:55.326 --> 02:23:56.060

02:23:58.896 --> 02:24:00.198
I DO I HAVE TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS

02:24:00.264 --> 02:24:02.233
CDA LOOKS AT PROPOSITION FIFTY

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:03.468
SIX IS SOMETHING REALLY JUST OF

02:24:03.534 --> 02:24:04.602
A SEA CHANGE FOR THE MEDICAL

02:24:04.669 --> 02:24:05.136
DENTAL --

02:24:05.203 --> 02:24:07.405
PROGRAM AFTER DECADES OF RATE

02:24:07.472 --> 02:24:09.040
STAGNATION WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING

02:24:09.107 --> 02:24:10.942
THESE THESE RATES COME IN AND I

02:24:11.009 --> 02:24:11.609
THINK ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES ON

02:24:11.676 --> 02:24:12.844
THE MAT ON THE GENOCIDE IS

02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:14.245
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHERE OF THE

02:24:14.312 --> 02:24:15.780
DENTAL SERVICES ARE FEE FOR

02:24:15.847 --> 02:24:16.547
SERVICE.

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:17.215
THERE AREN'T THE SAME

02:24:17.281 --> 02:24:18.649
COMPLICATIONS AS UNDER THE MAN

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:20.218
IT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE SO

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:21.452
DENNIS ARE GETTING THOSE TRACKS

02:24:21.519 --> 02:24:22.653
THEY'RE GETTING THEM IN A SINGLE

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.622
CHECK WHERE THEY GET A YOU KNOW --

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:26.057
AN EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS THAT

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:27.291
THIS IS YOUR RATE AND THIS IS

02:24:27.358 --> 02:24:28.026
YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL BUT

02:24:28.092 --> 02:24:29.594
ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE GETTING ONE

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:30.995
PAYMENT AND THEY ARE SEEING

02:24:31.062 --> 02:24:32.697
THOSE THERE ARE SOME DELAYS --

02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:33.965
THAT WE'RE SEEING AT THE

02:24:34.032 --> 02:24:35.166
BEGINNING OF BOTH THREE YEARS

02:24:35.233 --> 02:24:36.968
THERE TOOK SOME MONTHS BEFORE

02:24:37.035 --> 02:24:37.969
THOSE RATES ACTUALLY GOT OUT THE

02:24:38.036 --> 02:24:39.837
DOOR SO DENNIS DIDN'T START

02:24:39.904 --> 02:24:41.472
SEEING THAT I'M THE PAYMENTS

02:24:41.539 --> 02:24:42.807
UNTIL SIX ABOUT FIVE TO SIX

02:24:42.874 --> 02:24:43.474
MONTHS AFTER.

02:24:43.541 --> 02:24:44.976
BUT THEY ARE GETTING THEM RIGHT

02:24:45.043 --> 02:24:46.544
NOW AND THEY'RE THEY'RE GETTING

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:48.346
THEM AT WITH THE REST OF THEIR

02:24:48.413 --> 02:24:49.147
CHECKS AND SO THEY ARE REALLY

02:24:49.213 --> 02:24:50.081
SEEING THAT --

02:24:50.148 --> 02:24:51.749
SO ANECDOTALLY WE'RE HEARING

02:24:51.816 --> 02:24:53.785
FROM THOSE MEMBERS THAT --

02:24:53.851 --> 02:24:55.219
THIS REALLY THESE ARE MAKING

02:24:55.286 --> 02:24:56.421
CHANGES TO THEIR PRACTICES

02:24:56.487 --> 02:24:57.255
THEY'RE MAKING THE MORE

02:24:57.321 --> 02:24:58.256
SUSTAINABLE THAT THEY'RE

02:24:58.322 --> 02:25:00.058
INTERESTED IN EXPANDING WE GET

02:25:00.124 --> 02:25:02.093
COMPLIMENTARY CALLS FROM MEMBERS

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.461
TALKING ABOUT HOW MEDI CAL AND

02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:07.532
THAT THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT --

02:25:07.598 --> 02:25:08.032
YOU KNOW NOT TO SAY THAT

02:25:08.099 --> 02:25:11.102
EVERYTHING SPACE VERY PLEASED

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:12.837
WHEN WE GET THOSE PHONE CALLS --

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:14.539
AND THEY CALL US AND THEY SAY

02:25:14.605 --> 02:25:15.773
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.375
WHERE I CAN EXPAND I'M LOOKING

02:25:17.442 --> 02:25:19.243
AT BRINGING A NEW ASSOCIATE ON

02:25:19.310 --> 02:25:20.478
I'M LOOKING AT BRINGING MEDI CAL

02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:21.446
AND SO.

02:25:21.512 --> 02:25:23.247
ANECDOTALLY WE DO BELIEVE THAT

02:25:23.314 --> 02:25:24.749
THAT MEDI CAL RATES ARE DOING

02:25:24.816 --> 02:25:25.850
WHAT THE VOTERS AND THIS

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:27.618
LEGISLATURE INTENDED --

02:25:27.685 --> 02:25:29.120
WE THINK BEYOND THE ANECDOTES

02:25:29.187 --> 02:25:30.221
THAT THERE ARE SOME NUMBERS

02:25:30.288 --> 02:25:31.189
AGAIN I THINK ONE OF THE

02:25:31.255 --> 02:25:32.657
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MEDICAL

02:25:32.723 --> 02:25:34.192
THE DENTAL SIDE IS THAT WHEN FEE

02:25:34.258 --> 02:25:34.892
FOR SERVICE.

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:35.960
IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO GET

02:25:36.027 --> 02:25:37.929
THAT DATA WE HAVE ANNUAL DENTAL

02:25:37.995 --> 02:25:40.198
VISITS WE HAVE HOW MANY KIDS ARE

02:25:40.264 --> 02:25:40.798
GETTING PREVENTIVE VISITS WE

02:25:40.865 --> 02:25:41.766
HAVE.

02:25:41.833 --> 02:25:43.634
NUMBER OF DENNIS TOUR AND ROLLED

02:25:43.701 --> 02:25:44.235
I'M ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE

02:25:44.302 --> 02:25:46.571
GETTING A MONTHLY UPDATES OF

02:25:46.637 --> 02:25:47.872
THROUGH THE DTI --

02:25:47.939 --> 02:25:49.574
PILOT PROGRAM SO WE ACTUALLY

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:52.410
HAVE PRETTY UP TO DATE DATA AND

02:25:52.477 --> 02:25:55.179
WE ARE SEEING --

02:25:55.246 --> 02:25:55.746
I THINK AFTER OVER EIGHTEEN

02:25:55.813 --> 02:25:56.647
MONTHS.

02:25:56.714 --> 02:25:57.782
SINCE THE PROP FIFTY SIX

02:25:57.849 --> 02:25:58.382
SUPPLEMENTAL RATES WENT INTO

02:25:58.449 --> 02:26:00.284
EFFECT WE'VE SEEN AT NEARLY 10%

02:26:00.351 --> 02:26:01.886
INCREASE IN PROVIDERS --

02:26:01.953 --> 02:26:03.855
SO WHICH IS --

02:26:03.921 --> 02:26:04.388
TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE NEW

02:26:04.455 --> 02:26:06.858
DENTAL OFFICES AND NINE HUNDRED

02:26:06.924 --> 02:26:09.160
AND TEN PROVIDERS SO AGAIN YOU

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:10.761
KNOW IT'S A PROGRAM THAT SERVING

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:12.063
THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE.

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:13.131
THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE

02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:14.599
DONE BUT THIS IS COMING AFTER

02:26:14.665 --> 02:26:16.634
DECADE OF DECADES OF STAGNATION

02:26:16.701 --> 02:26:18.302
AND DROPS AND SO FOR US THIS IS

02:26:18.369 --> 02:26:19.971
REALLY POSITIVE --

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:21.439
WE'VE ALSO SEEN UTILIZATION

02:26:21.506 --> 02:26:22.607
ESPECIALLY ON THE CHILDREN SITE

02:26:22.673 --> 02:26:23.841
IMPROVING IT'S A LITTLE HARDER

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:25.076
ON THE ADULT SIDE JUST WITH ALL

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:26.911
THE MORE RECENT CHANGES. TO A

02:26:26.978 --> 02:26:29.280
MEASURE THAT --

02:26:29.347 --> 02:26:29.914
AND AGAIN THE DTI WE HAVE BETTER

02:26:29.981 --> 02:26:33.851
DAYS DOLE'S BUT WE'VE SEEN A 3%

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:35.286
INCREASE THEIR SORT OF A A

02:26:35.353 --> 02:26:38.689
PRETTY STEEP DIFFERENT JUMP

02:26:38.756 --> 02:26:41.192
201-320-1420. 1620173% KIDS

02:26:41.259 --> 02:26:42.827
UTILIZATION AGAIN DOESN'T

02:26:42.894 --> 02:26:44.495
COMPLETELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT

02:26:44.562 --> 02:26:45.997
IF IT'S POSITIVE TO US --

02:26:46.063 --> 02:26:47.732
WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

02:26:47.798 --> 02:26:49.267
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE

02:26:49.333 --> 02:26:51.235
THE RATES AND OUR BIG ASK THIS

02:26:51.302 --> 02:26:53.104
YEAR IS STABILITY THE SAME AS A

02:26:53.171 --> 02:26:54.238
CNA --

02:26:54.305 --> 02:26:55.706
DENNIS ARE MAKING FINANCIAL

02:26:55.773 --> 02:26:57.508
DECISIONS ABOUT WE KNOW WHETHER

02:26:57.575 --> 02:26:58.709
TO OPEN A PRACTICE AND THEY NEED

02:26:58.776 --> 02:27:01.279
THAT STABILITY.

02:27:01.345 --> 02:27:02.613
BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE ONE YEAR.

02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:03.781
MRS BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE ONE

02:27:03.848 --> 02:27:04.615
YEAR SPAS.

02:27:04.682 --> 02:27:06.184
BUT WE WE CAN'T TELL THEM WHEN

02:27:06.250 --> 02:27:07.451
WE PROMOTE THIS OUT TO OUR

02:27:07.518 --> 02:27:08.386
DENNIS AND SAY HEY TAKE ANOTHER

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:09.620
LOOK -- AT

02:27:09.687 --> 02:27:10.855
THE DENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM WE

02:27:10.922 --> 02:27:11.822
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL

02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:13.157
WE SAY ONE YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL

02:27:13.224 --> 02:27:14.825
RATES WE CAN'T SAY THESE RATES

02:27:14.892 --> 02:27:17.762
ARE INCREASING --

02:27:17.828 --> 02:27:19.230
THE DAY SHE'S BEEN RAISED THAT

02:27:19.297 --> 02:27:21.098
WE DON'T HAVE ANY EVALUATION AND

02:27:21.165 --> 02:27:22.433
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT'S BECAUSE

02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:23.935
WE JUST HAVEN'T CREATED ONE YET --

02:27:24.001 --> 02:27:25.303
THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP US FROM

02:27:25.369 --> 02:27:26.304
DOING THAT.

02:27:26.370 --> 02:27:27.672
ON THE DENTAL SIDE WE DO HAVE

02:27:27.738 --> 02:27:29.307
DATA WE CAN LOOK AT SO WE JUST

02:27:29.373 --> 02:27:30.575
NEED TO DEVELOP AN EVALUATION

02:27:30.641 --> 02:27:31.842
PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT WE

02:27:31.909 --> 02:27:33.044
WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT.

02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:34.845
AND FROM CITIES POINT OF VIEW WE

02:27:34.912 --> 02:27:36.480
DON'T THINK THAT STABILITY AND

02:27:36.547 --> 02:27:37.815
EVALUATION ARE NECESSARILY

02:27:37.882 --> 02:27:39.717
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE YOU COULD DO

02:27:39.784 --> 02:27:41.285
BOTH WHETHER THAT WAS PERMANENT

02:27:41.352 --> 02:27:42.720
BASE RATE CHANGES WHICH IS WHAT

02:27:42.787 --> 02:27:44.689
WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE --

02:27:44.755 --> 02:27:46.357
AND SOME KIND OF EVALUATION

02:27:46.424 --> 02:27:47.992
NOTHING TIES YOUR HANDS OF THE

02:27:48.059 --> 02:27:48.926
OF THE HANDS OF THE FUTURE

02:27:48.993 --> 02:27:50.027
LEGISLATOR ABOUT MAKING

02:27:50.094 --> 02:27:52.763
DECISIONS DOWN THE LINE BASED ON

02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:55.666
EVALUATIONS REPORTS BUDGET

02:27:55.733 --> 02:27:57.335
BUDGETARY NECESSITIES --

02:27:57.401 --> 02:27:59.103
THE ONE ISSUE THAT I WOULD BRING

02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:00.371
BEFORE YOU AYE IS ACTUALLY NOW

02:28:00.438 --> 02:28:02.406
YOUR ISSUE IT'S AROUND KIDS

02:28:02.473 --> 02:28:03.741
PREVENTION --

02:28:03.808 --> 02:28:05.276
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX DOES NOT

02:28:05.343 --> 02:28:06.711
HAVE ANY RATE INCREASES FOR KIDS

02:28:06.777 --> 02:28:08.813
PREVENTION IT'S ADULTS AND KIDS

02:28:08.879 --> 02:28:10.615
TREATMENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE

02:28:10.681 --> 02:28:12.116
DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE

02:28:12.183 --> 02:28:13.718
WHICH IS FOCUSED SOLELY ON KIDS

02:28:13.784 --> 02:28:15.052
PREVENTION WAS PUT IN PLACE

02:28:15.119 --> 02:28:16.554
BEFORE WE HAD.

02:28:16.621 --> 02:28:17.421
FIFTY SIX SO WE'RE TESTING SOME

02:28:17.488 --> 02:28:18.923
REALLY INNOVATIVE --

02:28:18.990 --> 02:28:19.957
VALUE BASED CARE --

02:28:20.024 --> 02:28:23.261
AND WE'RE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT

02:28:23.327 --> 02:28:24.595
WE THINK ARE WORKING --

02:28:24.662 --> 02:28:26.163
IT'S KIND WHEN BEEN SLOW TO GET

02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:27.632
OFF THE GROUND BUT WERE SEEING

02:28:27.698 --> 02:28:29.700
SOME IMPROVEMENT THERE SO THAT

02:28:29.767 --> 02:28:31.002
IN THAT PILOT PROJECT WILL AND

02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:32.536
WITH THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER

02:28:32.603 --> 02:28:34.138
IN TWENTY TWENTY AND I KNOW THAT

02:28:34.205 --> 02:28:34.905
THIS IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:35.906
OTHER SETTINGS.

02:28:35.973 --> 02:28:36.907
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM

02:28:36.974 --> 02:28:39.343
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SOLVE AND AS

02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:40.144
WE LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:28:40.211 --> 02:28:41.846
PROPOSAL FOR THE VALUE BASED --

02:28:41.912 --> 02:28:43.914
PAYMENTS IT ALL THE LANGUAGE SO

02:28:43.981 --> 02:28:45.082
FAR AS TALKED ABOUT MEN AT

02:28:45.149 --> 02:28:46.484
MANAGED CARE AND PHYSICIANS BUT

02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:47.952
WE WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE

02:28:48.019 --> 02:28:49.253
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE LESSONS

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:50.655
WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE DTI

02:28:50.721 --> 02:28:51.956
AND I'M TRYING TO DECIDE IF

02:28:52.023 --> 02:28:53.324
THERE'S WAYS WE CAN BRING DENTAL

02:28:53.391 --> 02:28:55.059
INTO THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE HUGE

02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:55.393
CONNECTIONS.

02:28:55.459 --> 02:28:57.561
BETWEEN CHRONIC CARE AND ORAL

02:28:57.628 --> 02:29:00.031
HEALTH AND GETTING AN EARLY AND

02:29:00.097 --> 02:29:02.767
DOING SOME OF THIS PREVENTION

02:29:02.833 --> 02:29:04.302
COULD -- AB

02:29:04.368 --> 02:29:05.236
INVOLVE A LOT OF COST SAVINGS

02:29:05.303 --> 02:29:05.870
FOR THE STATE.

02:29:05.936 --> 02:29:07.238
THINK WE ALSO SECOND THE

02:29:07.305 --> 02:29:09.006
COMMENTS OF CMA ON THE LOAN

02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:10.841
REPAYMENT WE'RE VERY EXCITED

02:29:10.908 --> 02:29:11.709
THAT THAT'S GETTING UP AND

02:29:11.776 --> 02:29:12.910
RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT HAS

02:29:12.977 --> 02:29:14.345
WORKED REALLY WELL WITH THE CMA

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:15.446
FOUNDATION.

02:29:15.513 --> 02:29:16.547
ON GETTING THOSE OUT THE DOOR

02:29:16.614 --> 02:29:18.716
AND I BELIEVE WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:20.651
HAVING AND FOLKS WE'RE GONNA BE

02:29:20.718 --> 02:29:21.585

MADE THIS YEAR WHICHIS VERY

02:29:22.987 --> 02:29:23.654
FAST.

02:29:23.721 --> 02:29:25.256
AND IF THERE ARE EXTRA DOLLARS

02:29:25.323 --> 02:29:25.856
WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A

02:29:25.923 --> 02:29:28.326
GREAT PLACE TO REALLY CONTINUE

02:29:28.392 --> 02:29:29.160

FOR WE'RE GOING ON ELEVEN YEARS --

02:45:59.983 --> 02:46:01.818
THESE KIDS ARE MEDICALLY FRAGILE

02:46:01.885 --> 02:46:03.153

02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:10.493
OF THOSE SUCCESS STORIES.

02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:10.794
WE HAD -- A

02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:12.929
BOY THAT WAS WITH US SINCE HE

WAS TEN AND WHEN HE TURNED

02:46:15.598 --> 02:46:17.133
EIGHTEEN WE WERE ABLE.

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:18.635
TO TRANSITION HIM HOME.

02:46:18.702 --> 02:46:20.403
AND HE HAS A COMPLETELY

02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:22.339

02:46:22.405 --> 02:46:25.041
HE CAME BACK TO SEE ME AND I

02:46:25.108 --> 02:46:26.076
ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS DOING HE

02:46:26.142 --> 02:46:27.911
SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB

02:46:27.977 --> 02:46:28.578
AND NO ONE COULD HIDE WOULD HIRE

02:46:28.645 --> 02:46:29.646
HIM.

02:46:29.713 --> 02:46:31.381
SO AS HE WAS AFTER WE FINISHED

02:46:31.448 --> 02:46:32.716
OUR CONVERSATION HE WAS WALKING

02:46:32.782 --> 02:46:35.919
OUT AND WHEN HE WAS WALKING DOWN

02:46:35.985 --> 02:46:37.153
THE HALL I SAID TO MYSELF.

02:46:37.220 --> 02:46:38.688
WHY DON'T I HIRE HIM?

02:46:38.755 --> 02:46:40.724

AND WE WILL LOOK AT SOME OF THE

02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:32.208
FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:47:32.275 --> 02:47:34.077
LOOKING AT LET'S SAY THE THIRTY

02:47:34.144 --> 02:47:35.578
FACILITIES --

02:47:35.645 --> 02:47:37.247
THE NUMBER MEDI CAL RELEASE THEY

02:47:37.313 --> 02:47:41.684

02:47:41.751 --> 02:47:43.353
THE HIGHEST VOLUME FOR A

02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:45.288
FACILITY IN THIS IS NOT A SMALL

02:47:45.355 --> 02:47:46.956
FACILITY THIS IS A FACILITY.

02:47:47.023 --> 02:47:49.325

AND THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO

02:47:59.002 --> 02:48:00.804
STAFF THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:02.338
WITH EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IT

02:48:02.405 --> 02:48:04.107
BECOMES REALLY CHALLENGING SO

02:48:04.174 --> 02:48:05.909
HOW THEY DO IT IS A TEN THE RIDE

02:48:05.975 --> 02:48:07.010
A LITTLE BIT MORE MID LEVEL

02:48:07.076 --> 02:48:08.678

THROUGHPUT VOLUME AND YOUR WAIT

02:48:12.182 --> 02:48:13.650
