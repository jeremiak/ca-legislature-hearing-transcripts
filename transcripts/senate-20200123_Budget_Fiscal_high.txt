AND ANOTHER ROUND OF LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MANY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AS YOU ALL HOPE ARE WELL AWARE THROUGHOUT THE SPRING THE LEGISLATURE WILL REVIEW THESE PROPOSALS AS WELL AS DISCUSS ADDITIONAL PRIORITIES THAT WE MAY TWO FOUR IDENTIFY. WITH THAT SAID OF THE TWO NIELSEN ON IF YOU HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. JUST BRIEFLY THE- AND THIS IS A GOOD START. ON THE YEAR AND I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUS IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS NOT SIMPLY ON PROVIDING SHELTER BUT IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT CAUSE PEOPLE TO BE ENDEMIC PLEA HOMELESS THE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IF REALLY GOING TO DEAL WITH THE HOMELESS PROBLEM. AND ANOTHER TH COLLECTION THAT JUST AS WITH RECENT BUDGET THOUGH CREATE A BIT OF A SURPLUS IT'S VERY THIN AND I WILL STILL ARGUE THAT OUR BUDGET IS PRECARIOUSLY BALANCED AND WE BEST BE MINDFUL OF THAT AND CAREFUL ABOUT THE PLACE BUILDING EXPENDITURES HUGE NEW IDEAS OR EXPENDITURES AND AN ADDITION. WHEN WE'RE DOING A NEW AGENCY CREATIONS CONSOLIDATIONS LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THE FORMER AGENCY FROM WHICH- THE- HAVE BEEN TRYING. THAT THEIR BUDGET DOES NOT INCREASE WHEN THEY LOOSE WIRES THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME HE CHIEF DEPUTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON AND ARE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S MISTER THAT THIS ONE OFTEN AND- GAY PANIC THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING WE'LL HEAR FIRSTHAND PART IN FINANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHAT I'LL DO TODAY'S BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET. AS WELL AS SOME KEY HIGHLIGHTS AND THEN AFTER THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED A SPENDING PLAN THAT TOTALSTWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS GENERAL FUND. THAT BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSES BALANCED THIS YEAR AS WELL AS OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD MEANING THE NEXT THREE YEARS. SO THERE ARE OPERATING SURPLUSES MEANING THAT REVENUES EXCEED EXPENDITURES IN EACH OF THOSE FOLLOWING FOR YEARS. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE FORECASTING SLOWER GROWTH AND THERE ARERISKS AHEAD AND FOR THAT REASON- WE ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD RESERVES IN THIS BUDGET. GOTTEN IS PROJECTING THAT BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE PEOPLE HAVE TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVES. OF WHICH EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE IN THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT ALSO KNOWN AS THE RAINY DAY FUND. ANOTHER ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. AND THEN FINALLY NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SIXTY RESERVE. MISSION BUILDING ON A SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAY THAT WERE LAST YEAR. IN THE BUDGET THAT THE ONCE ENACT LAST YEAR- WE HAD TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO CALPERS AS WELL AS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THIS BUDGET PROPOSES TO ACCELERATE THAT FULL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT. INTO THE CURRENT YEAR. YOU MAY RECALL FROM THE BUDGET ACT LAST YEAR THAT THERE WERE SUSPENSIONS BUILT INTO THE BUDGET. OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE BUDGET IN STRUCTURAL BALANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR CONTINUES THE SUSPENSIONS BUT DELAYS THEM BY EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IN ADDITION I KNOW THAT IN THIS COMMITTEE THERE WAS A ROBUST DISCUSSION OF THE MCO TAX PROPOSAL- DEMONSTRATION CONTINUES TO ASSUME APPROVAL OF THE- NCO TAX CONSISTENT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW- BUT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD BACK FROM THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT ASSUME THOSE REVENUES IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND ASSUMES THOSE REVENUES IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THAT. FINALLY TODAY SENATOR NIELSEN'S POINT ON THE SURPLUS WE ARE AT PROJECTING A SURPLUS. F FIVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR WHILE NOT AS BIG AS THE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR. STILL IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT- BUT TO YOUR POINT- WE EXPECT THAT MOST THAT SURPLUS IS ONE TIME IN NATURE. AND THAT IS WHY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES ALLOCATING NEARLY 80% OF THAT SURPLUS TO TEMPORARY OR ONE TIME PURPOSES. SO THAT'S THE OVERALL STRUCTURE THE BUT BUDGET I WILL JUST- TAKE OFF A COUPLE KEY HIGHLIGHTS AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AFTER LA- IN ANY OF THESE AREAS. THE FIRST IS IN EDUCATION- SO EARLY CHILDHOOD IS A PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR- THIS INCLUDES BUILDING ON LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AN ADDITIONAL TEN THOUSAND SLOTS- FOR STATE PRESCHOOL THESE ARE FULL DAY. FULL YEAR SLOTS AND MOVES US CLOSER TO THE GOVERNOR'S CALL FOR UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL FOR ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE CHILDREN AND THAT WILL COME AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY. ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IN ADDITION THE BUDGET CHANGES THE CAL CAL WORKS CHILD SUPPORT PASSED THROUGH SO THAT. FAMILIES RECEIVING CHILD SUPPORT- WHO ARE ON CAL WORKS INSTEAD OF RECEIVING JUST FIFTY DOLLARS BEING PASSED FOR IT WILL BE A HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THAT WILL BE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A- MORE. CHILD IN THE VAN. IN ADDITION BUILDING ON THE- OF THE SURGEONS. OFFICE LAST YEAR. THERE'S TEN MILLION. FOR ACROSS PUBLIC AWARENESS AND TRAINING CAMPAIGN. TO BUILD AWARENESS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD- ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND MAKING SURE THE KIDS GET THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED- BUILDING ON LAST YEAR'S EXPANSION OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE- WE ARE PROPOSING ADDITIONAL CHOP PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE PEOPLE. CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT WE'VE- AND THEN FINALLY AS YOU ALL KNOW THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONTINUING THAT EFFORT TO COME UP WITH A BROADER PLAN TO INTEGRATE ALL THESE EFFORTS. WHEN IT COMES TO K. TWELVE OR RATHER K. FOURTEEN- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES THE HIGHEST EVER VIABLE. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING. IT'S EIGHTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY THREE BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN LAST YEAR. AND WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THEIR IMPORTANT INCREASES- AS THE CHAIR MENTION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND ADDITIONAL APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS. THERE'S A NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THIS WILL GO OVER SEVERAL SEVERAL YEARS. BUT FOR TEACHER PREPARATION AND TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. THERE'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON SCHOOLS WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF CHALLENGES. THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AFTER COMMUNITY SCHOOL GRANTS AND THESE ARE SCHOOLS THAT INTEGRATED EDUCATIONAL. AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH I ALSO KNOW IT'S BEEN A- SUBJECT OF A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN THIS COMMITTEE- AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S AN INCREASE IN. MEAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR SCHOOLS BY APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. MAIN TO INCREASE. SUBSIDY FOR FREE REDUCED PRICE AND FIRST. AND ALSO SO MONEY FOR TO FOR CASH. WORKERS TO HELP THEM LEARN HOW TO BETTER PREPARE HEALTHIER MEALS- FOR THE SCHOOL. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS SOME MONEY FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WHICH IS ALSO PRIORITY OF THE GOVERNOR. MOVING ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION- THERE ARE 5% INCREASES FOR ABOUT UC AND CSU. THAT ARE BUILT INTO THE BUDGET- THERE'S ALSO SPECIFIC ON GOING MONEY FOR THE UC RIVERSIDE MEDICAL SCHOOL- AS WELL AS FOR THE UC AT UCSF FRESNO BRANCH CAMPUS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT CAMPUS. TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ON GOING FOR UC RIVERSIDE- AND IN ADDITION ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL THERE'S EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. FOR APPRENTICESHIPS AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BROADER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA. AND THEN FINALLY- BECAUSE SO MUCH THERE'S SO MUCH DISCUSSION AROUND STUDENT AT. THE BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO MAKE SURE MORE PEOPLE MORE BORROWERS WERE STUDENTS KNOW ABOUT THEIR DEBT REPAYMENT OPTIONS AND THAT WE HAVE OUTREACH TO THOSE PEOPLE. SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE. AND THEN AS WE ALL KNOW FINALLY THERE IS A SCHOOL BOND. THAT WILL BE ON THE BALLOT IN APPROXIMATELY FIVE OR SIX WEEKS. THAT'S FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH NINE BILLION IS FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE- AND THEN TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TWO BILLION FOR YOU SEE AND TWO BILLION FOR CSU. MOVING ON TO HEALTH CARE THE FLAGSHIP IN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IS KNOWN AS THE HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL INITIATIVE. AND THIS INITIATIVE PROPOSES TO TRANSFORM OUR MEDI CAL PROGRAMS FOCUS ON INTEGRATING SERVICES. INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE TREATING THE WHOLE PERSON FOCUSING ON VALUE BASED CARE AND- DELIVERING ON PAYMENT REFORM. AND WITHIN THAT THIS BUDGET PUTS A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- EVERYTHING FROM SETTING UP A TASK FORCE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- ALL MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER- PROVIDING THE RESOURCES TO COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR EFFORTS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S HELP YOUR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. EFFORTS ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE I. S. T. THAT'S DEEMED COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL POPULATION WHERE THERE IS OFTEN OVERLAP WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND HOMELESSNESS NEEDS- AND THEN FINALLY- THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PROPOSE THIS SPRING- SOME REFORMS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN TREAT THAT. A RANGE OF PEOPLE PROVIDE THEM ALL THE SERVICES THEY NEED. THE MINISTER IS ALSO PROPOSED AND NOT OF CON. IN THE AREA PRESCRIPTION DRUGS- RANGING FROM THE MEDI CAL BEST PRICE ALLOWING MEDICAL TO CONSIDER INTERNATIONAL PRICES WHEN THEY DO THEIR BARGAINING. TO THE STATE ESTABLISHING ITS OWN CAL OUR ACTS PRESCRIPTION DRUG LABEL- TO CONTRACT WITH A MANUFACTURER IS FOR THE PROVISION OF GENERIC DRUGS. SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE REALLY FIRST IN THE NATION CALIFORNIA'S TAKING THE LEAD CERTAINLY ON THE SCALE. SO THE MINISTRATION- WE WILL REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL TIME TO FLESH OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE. TO PUT THAT OUT THERE AND HAVE YOUR FEEDBACK AND DISCUSS THIS WITH ALL OF YOU. AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCES. THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO PROPOSING AT TAX ON DATING THIS TO BE. A TWO DOLLAR TAX PER FORTY MILLIGRAMS. AND THIS IS TO COME BACK THE DATING APP ATOMIC THAT SO MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE US. MOVING ON TO THE AREA OF FOOD AND SECURITY. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT IMPACTS OUR CALPERS PROGRAM AND SOME RULES BEING ISSUED OR ABOUT TO BE ISSUED. SO FOR THAT REASON THIS BUDGET PROPOSES TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR FOOD BANKS TO HELP- WITH SOME OF THAT PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT BE RESERVING THE SERVICES THAT THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY RECEIVING. A AND THEN IN ADDITION FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE THE CALIFORNIA WEBSITE. SO THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENROLL MORE OF THE POPULATION THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE FEDERAL BENEFITS. THIS BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A GREAT BIG EXPANSION OF THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. TO INCLUDE UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS WERE AGED SIXTY FIVE AND ABOVE. I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A PRIORITY OF MANY MEMBERS INCLUDING ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND SO THAT THIS BUDGET OUTSIDE AND AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE YEAR AND THAT WILL GROW THIS IS GENERAL FUND WILL GROW TO APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE DOLLARS ON IT ON. THE BASIS IN THE OUT YEARS. AND THEN FINALLY IS THE CHAIR MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS A HEARING ON DDS YESTERDAY. BUDGET TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR AND- FOR THREE ADDITIONAL SERVICE CODES. AS WELL AS SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT PERFORMANCE GRANT FUNDING AND MORE DETAILS. OF THOSE PROPOSALS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE WEEKS TO COME. ON HOMELESSNESS WAS THE CHAIR MENTIONED THIS IS BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND HE'S BEEN OUT ON THE ROAD INCLUDING TODAY- ON THIS ISSUE- THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT CAME OUT THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY- TALKED ABOUT THE- DEPLOYMENT OF TRAILERS AND MEDICAL TENDS. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING ALL THE RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT WE CAN. BUY IN ADDITION AS THE TURN NOTED THIS BUDGET PROPOSES A CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HOUSING AND SERVICES FIND FUNDED WITH SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN MONEY TO PROVIDE A REGIONAL APPROACH AT THE MINISTRY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND THIS WOULD BE TO STABILIZE BOARD IN CARE HOMES DEVELOP MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS AND THEN FINALLY PROVIDE RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO PEOPLE IN NEED. THIS BUDGET ALSO DOUBLES DOWN ON SOME OF THE BIG HOUSING INVESTMENTS THAT WERE- IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET INCLUDING ANOTHER ROUND OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS. DESPITE THE GOVERNOR IS ALSO GONE OUT AND SECURED FUNDING HELP THAT ARE CAUSING CRISIS. NOW TO ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN PUSHING FOR IN TERMS OF THAT ACCESS LAND IN MAKING SURE THAT WE USE THAT ACCESS STATE LAND FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS WAS THIS NEED. THE GOVERNOR'S ALSO SIGNALED THAT HE'S OPEN TO THE CREATION OF A UNIFIED HOUSING AND HOME SAFETY SO THAT ALL OF OUR- IN THIS AREA EVEN FOR A WIND. SURE THAT WILL BE A DISK WITH ALL IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. WAY UP. WANT TO. CLIMATE TWELVE FIRE IN EMERGENCIES THERE'S A LOT IN THIS AREA ALL JUST TALK ON THE VERY BRIEF HIGHER THEY- GOVERNOR PROPOSED WHAT CALLING A- BY. OF TWELVE AND A HALF. DOLLARS OVERALL THIS IS A THREE PART STRUCTURE PART ONE IS- FOUR POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. CLIMATE RESILIENCE BOND WITH THE MAJORITY OF THAT BOND FOCUSED ON WATER NEEDS WHETHER FLOOD. DROUGHT DRINKING WATER- BUT ALSO SEE LEVEL RICE AND EXTREME HEAT AND DEALING WITH ALL THOSE CHALLENGES. THE GOVERNOR'S ALSO PROPOSED OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS INVESTING ONE BILLION DOLLARS CLIMATE CATALYST FUND- AND THIS IS TO INVEST IN SPECIFIC PRIORITIES. LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION WASTE DIVERSION AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE WHERE WE THINK THERE ARE GAPS IN THE MARKET THERE ARE PROVING COMMERCIALISED TECHNOLOGIES. THAT ARE GETTING THE FINANCING THAT THEY NEED. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AND THAT CAN HELP A SECURE CLIMATE GOALS. AND THEN FINALLY OUR- CAP AND TRADE PLAN- WE ARE PROJECTING LOWER CAP AND TRADE REVENUE THAN WE DID THE PREVIOUS YEAR. BUT EVEN THAT WE'RE PROPOSING A CAP AND TRADE DISCRETIONARY PLAN OF NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. A AND IN ADDITION TO THIS THE BUDGET INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN WATER RESULT OF RESILIENCE AND SIGMA SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. IMPLEMENTATION DGSE REFORM AS WELL AS ACCESS TO PARKS IN EQUITY GRANTS FOR PARKS AS WELL AS FUNDING TO PURCHASE A NEW STATE PARK AND EXPAND OUR STATE PARKS IT. SPEAK TO ON LAW FIRE BUT- IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE DOLLARS FOR COPS. HE TOWARDS PASS. AS WELL YOU'RE STAFF. RELIEF FOR. ZERO ENGINE. I WAS EIGHT FIND OUT. WHY CHECK NOT TO HELP WITH ALL. THAT MANAGEMENT. THERE'S ALSO THE WALL FARM PRODUCTION FOR. ON TOP OF- YOU FUNDING FOR YES AND FOR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE ASSISTS FOR POWER SHUT OFFS LIKE THE TYPE WE EXPERIENCED LAST FALL. AND THIS WILL HELP US MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING ALL THE INFORMATION INTO ONE SINGLE HOT. AND THAT THE STATE CAN RESPOND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN ON EMERGENCIES THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR CYBER SECURITY WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE GOVERNOR SPECIFICALLY THE CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER. AND THE JOINT INCIDENTS RESPONSE TEAM AS WELL AS SEISMIC SAFETY FOR EARTHQUAKES AND THIS BUDGET INCLUDES SOME MONEY TO MOVE THAT SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION. INTO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES SO THAT THERE'S GREATER ALIGNMENT. THE LAST TWO AREAS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NUMBER ONE IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE- THAT. GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED THAT IF CURRENT POPULATION TRENDS CONTINUE. HE INTENDS TO CLOSE A STATE PRISON WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AND IN ORDER TO DELIVER ON THAT GOAL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT BUDGET FOCUS ON REHABILITATION EFFORTS INTO THE BUDGET INCLUDES A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES. IN THAT REGARD ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER OFFENDERS THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX TO CLUSTER THEM IN SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE THEY CAN RECEIVE INTENSIVE SERVICES. THE BUDGET CONTINUES ON THE LAST COMMITMENT. TO MOVE THAT DEPART DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE CHANGES TO DEPARTMENT OF YOU THINK ANY RESTORATION MOVING TO HHS- THAT SHOULD GO INTO EFFECT ON JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR PARTNERSHIPS WITH CSU IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM. AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND FINALLY TRAINING FOR STAFF TO THE C. R. AS WELL. AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY OF THIS BUDGET. IS TO EXPAND LAST YEAR'S PILOT ON FINES AND FEES AND REDUCING THE BURDEN SPECIFICALLY ON LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WERE INTERACTING WITH THE COURT SYSTEM. SO THIS BUDGET PROPOSES ELEVEN AND A HALF NO DOLLARS. TO EXPAND THAT PROGRAM STATEWIDE AND EXPANDED ON SIMPLY TRAFFIC FINES AND FEES. WEEKS THAT'LL HAPPEN FIND OUR- FORECAST. PRO TO. FIFTY SIX POINT. THE OUT YEARS AND THAT IS FINE WITH THAT BAKER INVEST IN THE TRIAL COURT'S IS CHEN OVER A HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLAR. THE RESULT A BOLD PROPOSE ON THIS BUDGET ON PROBATION WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF SHORTENING PROBATION TERMS TO TWO YEARS. BUT ALSO PUTTING IN- SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EACH OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS FOR INTENSIVE SERVICES BECAUSE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THAT IS REALLY WHERE. YOU WANT TO FOCUS IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE RATES OF RECIDIVISM AND DELIVER SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY NEED THEM. THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONAL MONEY IN THIS BUDGET FOR POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION- AND THEN THE FINAL AREAS ALL TALK ABOUT IN PUBLIC SAFETY MORE TALK MORE BROADLY ARE NUMBER ONE. THE CREATION OF A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAW THE GOVERNOR IS WORRIED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED BACK IN THIS AREA WHEN IT COMES TO CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION. AND THE FEDERAL CFPB SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING AUGMENTING DEPARTMENT AT THE OVERSIGHT. GREEN. THING AT THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL PROTECTION. STATION BUT MORE THAN THE REMAINING. ADDING ADDITIONAL. A KEEP. AND GIVING THAT ASIAN THAT DEPARTMENT THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE DEBT COLLECTORS- SO WE THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE CALIFORNIA CAN REALLY LEAD THE WAY. IN ABSENCE OF FEDERAL EFFORT. AND THEN FINALLY IN CANNABIS- THERE IS- REORGANIZATION PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. RIGHT NOW SOME OF THE REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL. THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- THIS PROPOSAL PROPOSES BRING ALL OF THOSE INTO A SINGLE DEPARTMENT. WITHIN THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO JOB CREATION- THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN OUT THERE AND WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR BUDGET- DEPENDS ON CONTINUALLY GROWING CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT THAT GROWTH BE SEEN IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE STATE NOT SIMPLY ON THE COAST. SO THE GOVERNOR HAS TO PROPOSALS HERE ONE IS TO PUT GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STAFF. IN AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE WE GENERALLY SEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT MAY HAVE BEEN LESS THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR WEALTHIER COASTAL AREAS. SO WE'RE GONNA PUT STAFF IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE ILAND EMPIRE ON THE CENTRAL COAST AND IN THE NORTH OF CALIFORNIA NORTH OF HERE. TO HELP MAKE THE CASE FOR WHY BUSINESSES SHOULD RELOCATE AND TRAIN AND HIRE WORKERS OVER THERE. IN ADDITION TO PROMOTE SMALL BUSINESS CREATION THIS BUDGET INCLUDES OF. EXEMPTION FROM THE STATE'S MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX SO THAT'S APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT CORPORATIONS BECAUSE CORPORATION ALREADY TO RECEIVE THIS EXEMPTION. SEVERAL LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE BEST. OFF THE ABOUT THIS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR CHARGE. IN THE VERY NEAR. OF THESE PIECES BUT PEACE WITH GOVERNOR FIVE YOUR- PLAN WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS. PUTS NEW PUTS MONEY INTO BROADBAND SO THAT WERE NAPPING STATED ACTIVITY ALL ACROSS THE STATE IN THE SURE THAT. STOCK IS TO THIS SOUL RESEARCH. TO THE KEY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BUDGET ONCE JUST SIMPLY. SOME OF THE GOVERNOR PRIORITIES I KNOW THERE MAY BE OTHERS BUT- AFTER LA HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. I THAT YES COLLEAGUES WHO ARE TO HOLD OUR- AND THE LA HIS AT THE- PRESENT TO PRESENT AND BEFORE YOU GET. SIR IF YOU WOULD ALLOW US TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CENTERS MITCHELL HERE. NIELSEN YOUR SELF. A COUPLE AIR. DOLLY. FOR TITLE JONES. LEYVA MCGUIRE MORNING YOUR MORE LOCK. PAN HERE ROTH YOUR SKINNER HERE STERN HERE'S A BURKE. AYE CASKEY. IF. DID YOU GET THROUGH THE BILL HE HE WITH HIS RIGHT BEHIND YOU UNCHARACTERISTICALLY QUIET I HEARD YOU I HEARD YOU BUT I WASN'T SURE SHE DID HE'S HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ESTABLISH A QUORUM- CEPEK HAPPY NEW YEAR AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE THIS MORNING TODAY WHAT I WAS HOPING TO DO IS. CONCENTRATE MY REMARKS IN THREE MAIN AREAS TO HELP THINK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT- WE JUST. HEARD A DESCRIPTION OF. TO THE FIRST WOULD BE- I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A COMMON ON KIND OF THE OVERALL BUDGET STRUCTURE INCLUDING THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE SECOND AREA IT IS TO OFFER SOME COMMENTS ON SOME OF THE KEY CHOICES AS WE SEE THEM- WITHIN THE BUDGET PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE STATE'S ESTIMATED DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES. AND THEN THIRD- I WOULD JUST OFFER A VIEW OF. WHAT THE WHOLE PACKAGE AND WHAT ITS IMPLICATIONS ARE FOR THE STATE'S BUDGET CONDITION AND ITS MULTI YEAR FISCAL OUTLOOK. SO WITH THAT IF YOU HAVE THE HANDOUT. HELLO MOVE ON TO THE FIRST PAGE. AND HERE I'LL BEGIN WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT NO ADDRESS IT SEPARATELY BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES THE MINIMUM FUNDING LEVEL FOR SCHOOLS. AND AS WE ALREADY HEARD- IN THE IN THE COMING BUDGET YEAR THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES EIGHTY FOUR BILLION FOR THE TOTAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. NOW OF THIS THERE'S ABOUT DID THIS REPRESENTS A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FROM THE CURRENT YEAR. AND OF THAT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. ALLOCATING ONE POINT FOUR BILLION TO NEW ONGOING SPENDING PRIMARILY TO FIND THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND THEN HE HOLDS ONE POINT ONE BILLION IN ALLOCATE STAFF FOR ONE TIME PURPOSES. WE THINK THAT THAT SPLIT IS PRUDENT. BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE BUDGET THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET TO ACCOMMODATE A DECLINE IN THE GUARANTEE LEVEL- WITHOUT NECESSARILY NEEDING TO MAKE CUTS TO ONGOING PROGRAMS. A COUPLE OF OTHER COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE IS THAT ALTHOUGH. MANY OF THE PROPOSALS ARE IN THE ONE TIME- CATEGORY. B. ADDRESS IN MANY CASES THEY ADDRESS SOME LONG STANDING ISSUES FACING EDUCATION AND FACING THE STATE. AND SO YOU KNOW WE JUST THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY- HAVE PROPOSED TO ADDRESS. ARE ACTUALLY BETTER SUITED FOR- TO BE SUPPORTED BY A ONGOING FUNDING. THE SECOND. AREA THAT I WOULD MENTION IN THIS- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. SECTION IS JUST EXCUSE ME. THIS IS JUST THE- WHETHER OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PREFER TO REPURPOSE SOME OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING IN THE AREAS OF THE STATES THAT THE DISTRICTS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LONG TERM LIABILITIES AND THAT WOULD BE ONE CONSIDERATION IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO MAXIMIZE THE FISCAL IMPACT FOR THE DISTRICTS OVER THE LONGER TERM. YOU CAN SO MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE HERE REALLY MOVING PAST THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- PORTION OF THE OF THE BUDGET SOME REALLY TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE WITHIN THE PROPOSITION- WITHIN THE WITHIN THE BUDGET YOU'LL NOTE HERE AT THE TOP OF THE SLIDE WE REFER TO A SIX BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. AND IN THIS CONTEXT WHEN I SEE SURPLUS WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED RESOURCES. ABOVE WHAT THE STATE WILL NEED TO FIND ITS CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. AND IT'S EXISTING PROGRAM COMMITMENTS. SO ONE THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE SURPLUS THAT WE ESTIMATE FOR THE COMING YEAR- IN THE REASON THAT IT'S SO SIMILAR IS THAT WE HAVE VERY SIMILAR REVENUE ESTIMATES IN FACT. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS ONLY ABOUT THIRTY FOUR MILLION IN% HIGHER REVENUES IN THE BIG THREE REVENUES THAT OUR OFFICE SO THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR CELESTIN. POINT 1% OF- GEN OF THOSE REVENUES. ONE OTHER OBSERVATION THAT YOU'LL NOTE IN THE BUDGET IS THAT THERE ARE RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBER OF SMALL PROGRAM SO WHEN I SAY SMALL PROGRAMS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROGRAMS WERE A PROPOSALS WORTH LESS THAN A HUNDRED BILLION HUNDRED MILLION. AND OVER 95% OF THE PROPOSALS ARE ACTUALLY FOR LESS THAN THAT AMOUNT SO THAT'S A NOTABLE FEATURE OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. GOING TO THE NEXT SLIDE HERE WERE DISPLAYING IN THE FIGURE OUT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO ALLOCATE FOUR POINT ONE BILLION. IN THE SURPLUS ACROSS VARIOUS PROGRAM AREAS. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT AT A HIGH LEVEL. MUCH OF THE ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS ARE GOING TOWARD ADDRESSING THE HOMELESSNESS- ISSUE AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. WE'RE AS MUCH OF THE ONGOING FUNDING GOES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT MY POINT ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. THAT THEY'RE A HIGH NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALL PROPOSALS. THIS PRISON THIS RAISES SOMEWHAT OF A TRADE OFF FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT WOULD FIRST PREFER TO PURSUE THAT APPROACH OR IF YOU WOULD RATHER DIRECT. YOU KNOW MORE OF ITS RESOURCES TO A FEWER NUMBER OF BIGGER TICKET ITEMS AND SO THAT SORT OF ONE OF THE BIGGER CHOICES FACING THE LEGISLATURE IS A COASTER THAT GOES THROUGH THIS BUDGET. ANOTHER POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IN ITS ENTIRETY WE BELIEVE THAT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO EXERT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE STATE'S COST STRUCTURE OVER THE LONG TERM. IN WAYS THAT GO BEYOND WATER INCLUDED IN THESE ESTIMATES. SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN NEW ONGOING SPENDING AND WE CAN ESTIMATE THAT WOULD INCREASE TO ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION OVER TIME. BUT THEN HE DOES ALSO PROPOSE FOR THE STATE TO ENGAGE IN NEW ACTIVITIES AND AS- AN AS WE HEARD SOME OF SOME OF THESE ARE- REALLY BOLD AND IT WILL IN A WAY AND GO BEYOND. WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE EVEN DONE IN THE AREA OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR EXAMPLE. NOW MANY OF THESE IDEAS MAY HAVE MERIT. AND THEY MAY BE. WORTH CONSIDERING BUT WE JUST THINK THAT THERE'S THE POTENTIAL THAT THEY WOULD INCREASE COSTS TO THE STATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS OVER THE LONG TERM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF. AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION AT THIS POINT TO. DETERMINE THE PRECISE AMOUNT. NOW IN THE NEXT SLIDE WHAT I'M SHOWING HERE IS A CHART THAT- DISPLAYS. THE GOVERNOR'S. PLAN OVER A MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK. AND WHAT YOU WOULD SEE FROM THIS IF I COULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE DARKER SHADED PARTS OF THE BLUE BARS YOU WOULD SEE THAT THERE ARE SURPLUSES IN THE FUTURE YEARS BUT THE SURPLUS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL. FURTHERMORE THEY DEPEND ON THREE KEY ASSUMPTIONS ONE IS THAT THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW. THE SECOND IS THAT THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX IS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THEN FINALLY THAT THE SUSPENDED PROGRAMS THAT WERE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THOSE SUSPENSIONS DO TAKE A FACT IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND IN FACT IF YOU. YES IF THOSE SUSPENSIONS DID NOT TAKE AFFECTING AS YOU RECALL FROM LAST BUDGET PROCESS WE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDED WITH THE SUSPENSION PROVISIONS WERE REALLY- APPROPRIATE TO HAVE- THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE IN THEM AND IF THOSE SUSPENSIONS DID NOT TAKE EFFECT AND THE OUT YEAR WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW DEFICIT SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF. SO ON THE FINAL PAGE ALEVIATE YOU WITH A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THE FIRST IS JUST THAT- IF YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THE TOTAL LEVEL OF RESERVES. SHOWN IN THE BUDGET OUR. WHETHER THE TOTAL LEVEL ELEVEN RESERVE SHOWN IN THE BUDGET ARE. IT'S SATISFACTORY TO THE LEGISLATURE'S. PREFERENCES FOR ONE THING THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT ADD TO THE DISCRETIONARY LEVEL OF RESERVES IN THIS BUDGET AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS AN INCREASE UNDER THE PROPOSITION TO A REQUIREMENTS THERE'S NO ADDED LEVEL OF RESERVE IN THE DISCRETIONARY PORTION. SO ANOTHER WAY TO BUILD BUDGET RESILIENCE WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE STATE'S OPERATING SURPLUS FROM WHAT IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED WE MENTIONED IN NOVEMBER THAT NO MORE THAN ONE BILLION SHOULD SEE SHOULD BE SPENT ON. NEW ONGOING PURPOSES GIVEN OUR OUTLOOK AND THE GOVERNOR SPEND A BIT MORE THAN THAT AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE RISK OF A RECESSION COMING IN THE- OVER THE OUTLOOK PERIOD WE THINK IT IS SOMEWHAT ELEVATED GIVEN SOME OF THE INDICATIONS THAT WE SEE NOW AND THE FACT THAT THE MID THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION IS QUITE MATURE AT THIS POINT. AND SO GIVEN THAT WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER LARGER RESERVES FOR THE LARGER OPERATING SURPLUS EITHER WAY WE THINK THIS THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER CONTINUING TO BUILD THE STATE'S FISCAL RESILIENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SEE SENATOR RALPH FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORLOCK SENATOR OFF. THE MANAGER OF CAN EITHER OF YOU- FIGURE THIS OUT CAN EITHER OF YOU TELL ME WHAT THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE FAILURE PROVES THE EXTENSION OF THE MCO. TAX IS ON THE BUDGET IN TERMS OF DOLLARS. YEAH I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT IT WOULD BE SO WE ARE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS YEAH SO- WE'RE NOT ASSUMING IT FOR THE BUDGET YEAR ABOUT WERE IT NOT TO BE APPROVED- IT WOULD BE IN EXCESS OF A BILLION DOLLARS ON IN ANY. AND THEN SHIFTING GEARS TO. K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION YOU KNOW CONSIDERING THE COLA THE SIZE OF THE COLA OR SOME WOULD SAY THE LACK OF THE SIZE THE COLA AND THE ROUGHLY NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PROGRAM TO PROPOSED FOR- TEACHER RECRUITMENT IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER THINGS OVER OVER TIME. AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACED NOW AND WILL BE PHASED IN THE FUTURE BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH WITH REGARD TO. DISTRICTS PORTION OF THE UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY. WAS ANY THOUGHT GIVEN TO INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FLOWING TO DISTRICTS OR TWO COASTERS FOR OF. UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY DOWN. YES ALL MAKE A ONE OR TWO POINTS AND MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA MAIL OPERATE AS WELL I THINK THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE PAYMENT THAT WAS MADE LAST YEAR OF APPROXIMATELY AT THREE A LITTLE OVER THREE TWO THREE BILLION DOLLARS ON THAT WAS INTENDED TO FLOW AND THAT IF IT DISTRICTS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS AND NOT JUST IN INTENT THAT THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE WILL HAPPEN BUT IN THE WAY THAT IT WAS STRUCTURED IN SO THE WAY THAT THREE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WAS WAS TO HELP BY DOWN SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONTRIBUTIONS. IN THE CURRENT YEAR OR THE YEAR WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW BUT THEN ALSO A PORTION OF THAT OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS TO BE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR SO FOR THIS YEAR TO CALM AND VAST MAJORITY OF THAT MONEY TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WAS DEPOSITED TO CAL STIRS FOR THE LONG TERM SO THAT SHOULD REDUCE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONTRIBUTIONS WHENEVER YOU'RE TO CALM OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS AND SO WE PUT THAT THAT PROVIDE SOME RELIEF AND IT YOU KNOW. WAIT FOR LAW SCHOOL DISTRICT DOESN'T COULD NOT BUT THINK MAKE A DIFFERENCE OVER THE LONG TERM I THINK THE SECOND THING IS- THIS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT LEVEL- IT HAS THAT CALL UP VER 2% THAT YOU MENTION FOR LCS FAST AND WE PUT IT ALL TOGETHER- EVEN AGAINST THE ADJUSTED LEVELS LAST YEAR IT'S ADDITIONAL TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS SO WE THINK THAT MAKES A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. THERE WAS MY FOR TO WHAT YEAR AND THEN THE SEDITION ALL NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR AND THEN THE LAST THING I'LLMENTION- BECAUSE WE DID IT LAST YEAR BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THIS YEAR IS THIS EXPANSION OF STATE SCHOOL PROGRAM- IT'S FOR NON ALLEY A SPORTS FULL DAY FOR YOUR PRESCHOOL- THAT WAS PULLED OUT OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE LAST YEAR- AND SO THAT IT TOO TIONAL TEN THOUSAND SLOTS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO FUNDS THIS YEAR WHICH COMES AT A COST OF OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. ON THAT WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THE IGHTY FOUR GOING DOLLARS IN PROPERTY NINE EIGHT FUNDING SO WE THAT MY IS TIGHT AS FOR MANY DISTRICTS BUT WE THINK ALL THE IN TO GET WHAT CAN AND YOU WANT. I JUST CALLED. PERMANENT FINANCING. THE CAR. AND ROTH I WOULD ALSO ADD. HEAD TO THE X. AS IN THAT IN A TO THOSE IN THE- WE ALSO. ROLLING OVER THIS HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION WE PROVIDED YEAR FOR ED. INTO INCREASING THE BASE GRAND FOR ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IN ADDITION WE'RE ADDING ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ON TOP OF THAT FOR ON THE EARLIEST LEARNERS BUT DISABILITIES. I'M SO THOSE ARE INCREASES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT SHOULD HELP THEM ADDRESS SOME OF THE COSTS THAT THEY'RE SEEING WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE HAD IN MIND IN TERMS OF BUILDING AND QUITE A BIT OF ONE TIME- INTO OUR ON GOING WAS AS AND FEEDBACK WE GOT FROM DISTRICTS AROUND WHAT INFORMATION IT IS THAT WE PUT OUT ABOUT COLA- AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND HOW AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE PUT OUT A COLA ON THE SAY LIKE WHAT WITH SOMEONE CALL A SUPER COLA LARGER THAN THAT THE STATUTORY COLA. ON TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS THEN CUT MI REVISION- WHEN REVENUES IF REVENUES DROP- THAT THAT IS IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TO BUDGET BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF EVERYTHING. SO THOSE WERE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WERE KEEPING IN MIND WE WERE BUILDING THIS BUDGET. WELL I REALIZE IT'S NEVER ENOUGH MONEY. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND IT'S PROBABLY TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO SEVERAL THINGS IN CALIFORNIA BUDGET WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION CERTAINLY ONE AREA WHERE WE CAN. THIS IS COOL TRICKS UP AND DOWN THE STATE IS IN. CONTINUE INCREASED FUND FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND- I SUSPECT THAT IT IS TRUE AND THEY TELL ME THAT YOU KNOW THE FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVE IS ONLY ABOUT 40% DEPEND ON THE DISTRICT OF THE- PER. SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE. YOUNG PEOPLE SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL MONEY AVAILABLE IN THE BUDGET THAT WE CAN RE DIRECT. TO DISTRICTS. TO HELP THEM COVER THE COST OF. SPECIAL EDUCATION WHICH THEY OTHERWISE HAVE TO PULL OUT OF THERE. GENERAL FUND- WILL HELP AS WELL SO WILL CONTINUE TO THE CONVERSATION I. APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE IN THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SIR SENATOR MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS IF I. IF I COULD- JUST GOING HISTORICALLY WEAK WE KEEP REFERRING TO THE POTENTIAL OF A RECESSION. AND WHEN WE WENT THROUGH. OTHER RECESSIONARY PERIODS LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION THE STATE. HAD A HABIT OF TAKING MONEY FROM LOCAL- CITIES AND COUNTIES. KIND OF A DYSFUNCTIONAL HABIT BUT THAT'S JUST HOW IT HAPPENED THROUGH. EITHER TAKING OF FUNDS OR- REALIGNMENT HER OTHER. STRATEGIES SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ARE HAVE HAS THIS STATE REALLY PAID. ALL OF OUR CITIES IN CAP THIS. HE AT HAVE OCCURRED. TEN YEARS AGO DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. YOU'RE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT BORROWING FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES RIGHT YES SO- I WILL NEED TO DOUBLE THAT DEBT REPAYMENTS THAT OCCURRED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH THE WALL JACK INCLUDING IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- THERE MAY BE SOME OUTSTANDING- MANDATE SIR YOU KNOW AND CERTAIN PAYMENT SO I'LL HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT ISSUE AND GET BACK TO YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER PROTECT FOR PROVIDING AT IN THIS. STUDY THAT THE DEFINITION OF WHAT A SURPLUS IS AND SO I JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT SACRAMENTO ON THEM LOOKING AT ALL THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. THEY HAVE ISSUES OF DEBT- THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND- HE IT WAS SORT OF MENTIONED IN TRYING TO DO MORE IN YOUR OTHER REPORTS. FOR SCHOOLS WERE ACTUALLY FOR THE STATE IN SCHOOLS TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THE PENSION PLANS SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IS AS THE STATE ENJOYS A- SURPLUS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE LIKE A AN ALLOCATION TO CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND THEN. REQUIRE THAT THEY GET OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARE BASED ON A FORMULA POPULATION OR WHATEVER AND THEN THAT MONEY JUST GOES INTO THEIR PENSION PLAN SO THAT IN GOOD TIMES WERE SORT OF HELPING OUT CITIES AND COUNTIES SO THAT. WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME TO THEM IN BAD TIMES. IF WE NEED. SOME KIND OF CASH TO GET THROUGH A RECESSION BECAUSE OUR- TAXING SYSTEM IS MUCH MORE VOLATILE THAN A PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM. RESERVE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHY AREN'T WE- BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS LIKE THE STATE IS TALKING SURPLUS AND CITIES. ARE ARE TALKING FINANCIAL SCARCITY I MEAN WE'VE WE HAD A BILL THAT ASKS FOR EMERYVILLE IN SCOTTS VALLEY TO INCREASE THEIR SALES TAX WHICH THE GOVERNOR VETOED BUT- THOSE CITIES OUR MESSAGING. SOME AND WE GOT A BUT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HELP OUT. I'LL MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS AND I KNOW I WAY I MAY HAVE SOME AS WELL I THINK FIRST IS THAT- WITH THE SURPLUS BOTH LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR- THERE CERTAINLY WAS. IN ADDITION TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNANCE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND CITIES AND COUNTIES- WITH REGARD TO REALIGNMENT THAT YOU MENTIONED THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL MONEY IN THE BUDGET THAT FLOW DIRECTLY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IN SPECIFICALLY. ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS ALONE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OVER ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. WENT SPECIFICALLY TO CITIES COUNTIES IN CONTINUUM'S OF CARE FOR THESE TYPES OF SERVICES SO YOU KNOW WHAT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A SHARED PRIORITY AND WE HOPE THAT THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME RELIEF BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE THAT LOCALITIES ARE UNDER. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT IS ON LAST YEAR'S BUDGET OR- THAT COUNTY I AM- WE FOR AYE HSS- AND THAT WAS A RE NEGOTIATION WITH THE STATE AND CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE STATE IS PUTTING AND- SEVERAL HUNDRED EXTRA MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL AND THAT SHOULD PROVIDE SOME RELIEF. AS WELL FOR A PROGRAM WHERE WE KNOW WE'RE FACING. RISING COSTS- BUT ON THE BROADER ISSUE OF THE SURPLUS- THE STATE OF COURSE- HAS THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES BUT THE STATE AS YOU KNOW ALSO HAS ITS OWN OBLIGATIONS AND THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR PENSION AND RETIREE HEALTH CARE OBLIGATIONS. WE NEED TO PUT MY AS WELL IT'S WHERE THOSE OPTIONS AT THE STATE ITSELF IS ON THE HOOK FOR AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID- A GREAT DEAL ON A LAST YEAR'S ENACTED BUDGET. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO SO FAR TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES- FOR THE STATE'S SURPLUS- IT'S ONLY- RIGHT I THINK IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION. THAT THAT MONEY GO TO WORK STATE UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS FIRST. IN THE U. BROUGHT UP ALMOST AS AND THAT'S WHERE WHERE TO GO NEXT AND THAT'S WHERE I DO SEE THE STATE HELPING. CITIES AND COUNTIES- BUT IT SEEMS SILO TO ME SO WE'VE GOT ONE PROGRAM FROM LAST YEAR NEW PROGRAM FROM THIS YEAR WE HAVE PROPOSITION TWO. WHICH PROVIDES THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME. IN A FUNDING AND- WE'VE HAD A YEAR NOW SINCE. MEASURE PASS. HOW ARE WE DOING ON GRANT FOR. HOW COUNTY. DOING AND WHAT MY HAS BEEN TO. DISCUSS YES ALL FIRST ABOUT JAY. GOV AND IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY SO. FOR GOVERNANCE- THIS IS BEEN A PRIORITY SINCE THE GOVERNOR TOOK OFFICE BUT EVEN IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS AND MONTHS. YOU'RE SEEING THAT MINISTRATION FURTHER STEP UP IN THIS AREA SO THE GOVERNOR. HAS APPOINTED AND HIS OFFICE IS SENIOR COUNSELOR SPECIFICALLY ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. HE SAID ONLY HALF JOKINGLY DURING HIS OWN BUDGET PRESS CONFERENCE THAT HE HIMSELF WAS THE HOMELESSNESS ARE. ON AND THEN HE SIGNALED THE AND THE GUY AND- BUDGET EIGHT PAGES THAT YOU'D LIKE TO EXPLORE THE CREATION OF A HOUSING HOMELESSNESS. DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY- TO FURTHER A LINE THESE EFFORTS- SO THERE IS A REAL FOCUS ON MAKING SURE NOT ONLY THAT WERE. INVESTING THE RESOURCES THAT ARE REQUIRED. BUT THAT THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INTEGRATED ACROSS THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE. THAT ARE DEALING WITH THIS AND THIS SPECIFICALLY IS A PRIORITY. OF OUR HHS PROPOSAL AND OF COURSE A LOT OF OUR HOMELESSNESS EFFORTS. ARE WITHIN THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. BUT AS WE NOW- PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE OFTEN EXPERIENCING HEALTH CHALLENGES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. SO IT'S ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT THAT ANYTHING WE DO IN THE HHS SPACES ALSO COORDINATED. SO THAT'S ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE WHEN IT COMES TO PACIFIC WHICH TO THE FUNDING. AT THE GOVERNOR- IS- BELIEVES THAT THAT MONEY THAT NOW OVER BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CHARGE WAS TO BUDGET AX AGO. AND THEN THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE THE- TIME FROM LAST YEAR THAT IS ACT. IT'S GOING OUT RIGHT NOW. ON AND I KNOW CAN BE FRUSTRATING WHEN IT TAKES A COUPLE MONTHS FOR THE MONEY TO GO OUT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS GOING TO THE RIGHT AND TO BE THE- PLANS IN PLACE. TO I IT CAN THANK EFFECTIVELY. BECAUSE THE ADVOCACY OF THAT SPENDING IS KEEN READING OF WHETHER WE DECIDE TO INVEST FURTHER SOURCES. IN THE FUTURE. HE'S GOING TO SEE AND COUNTIES THE- TAX ARE MONTH THAT'S A SEVEN FIFTY NINE TO. IN TERMS OF THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME. THAT FINISHED AT THE UNITED THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS I BELIEVE THE FIRST TRY CHAT HAS GONE OUT A RISK. OUT AND THERE IS NO OF FUNDING AVAILABLE. FOR THE SECOND CRUNCH OF THAT AND MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS CAN ALSO SPEAK. TO THAT- THAT THAT'S ALSO A PLACE WHERE WE WANT TO GET THOSE RESOURCES OUT BUT AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND IT ALL IN ONE SHOT. BEFORE PEOPLE ARE READY AND WE GET A SENSE OF HOW TO MOST EFFECTIVELY SPEND IT AND WHAT WORKS. AND THEN THE FINAL POINT THAT'LL MAKE IS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS CALIFORNIA. HOUSE ACCESS TO HOUSING AND SERVICES FUND WHICH THAT YOU'RE MENTIONED IN HER OPENING. REMARKS THIS IS DESIGNED TO SUPPLEMENT AND NOT SUPPLANT THE EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON AT THE CITY AND COUNTY LEVELS SO. WHILE THAT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS FROM LAST YEAR'S PROJECT IS GOING OUT. WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING WITH THIS FUND AND WE'RE HOPING FOR EARLY ACTION ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THAT WILL BE A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF YOU. IN THE LEGISLATURE. THAT THAT WE'LL GET TO THESE OTHER PRIORITIES IN CONCERT WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES SPECIFICALLY FOR STABILIZING THESE PORTENT CRE HOMES WHICH WE ALL KNOW. FROM EXPERIENCE ARE FROM READING NEWS COVERAGE ARE AT RISK AND DO NEED TO BE STABILIZED. WE NEED MORE FLEXIBLE NIMBLE APPROACH FOR GETTING RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM. AND THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN DO ON DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AND NOT SIMPLY TAKING. A STATE YOU KNOW. OUCH WHERE IT'S ONE SIZE FITS ALL. BUT AT THIS. TIME NOT LETTING EVERY. ASSN CITY ITS OWN THING WITHOUT ANY SORT OF ACCOUNTABILITY. SO WE ARE PROPOSING A REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR MODEL. LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES IN BUILDING AND ACCOUNTABILITY INTO THAT SYSTEM. AND I THINK WHEN YOU PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER. THIS IS NOT A CHALLENGE THAT CAN BE SOLVED IN ONE YEAR OR TWO YEARS. BUT WE HOPE THAT NOT ONLY THIS INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES BUT HOW IT'S A WIND AND HOW THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS. WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE BEST RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT. IN SENATOR MORE LIKE. YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL- IN PARTICULAR WITH REGARD TO HOMELESSNESS- YOU KNOW THE- ONE. WOULD YOU THE QUESTION ABOUT RESOURCES FOR CITIES. WE NOTED THAT IN THE PRESS IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET. THERE WERE RESOURCES GIVEN DIRECTLY TO THE CITIES BUT IN THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE US THERE IS A SHIFT A CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT THE- HOMELESSNESS DOLLARS ARE ADMINISTERED AND WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME. REASONABLE QUESTIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE DATE- WHAT ARE THE WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION LED TO THAT SORT OF CHANGE. AND WHY. CHANNELING THOSE INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES VERSES THAT THE PRIOR MODEL. AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS WE THINK ARE PROBABLY- PRODUCTIVE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO FIND OUT THROUGHOUT THIS BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR RESPONSES ARE APPRECIATED I DO NOT FOR TODAY BUT FOR THE FUTURE- I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS ARENA. NUMBERS THEY HAVE BECOME SO LARGE- FOR CITIES THAT THEY'RE CHOKING- WERE WERE ASKING CERTAIN CITIES TO BUILD. A NUMBER OF UNITS THAT THEY HAVEN'T BUILT IN FORTY YEARS. OF HISTORY SOLDIERS JUST. JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO. SEE WHAT WE CAN DO IT ARE CAN. OUR STAR CITY- IN OUR IN OUR DISTRICT HOW WE GET SOME BALANCE. IN ANOTHER SUBJECT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE IS WHAT WE'RE DOING THE FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER- AND DO WE KNOW WE APPROVED. DOING ASIDE STUDY BUT THERE WAS ALSO ABOUT A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION LECTURE BUT I. I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE. AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COULD MORE. THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR REPORTING IT'S VERY HELPFUL. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF THE PRIVATE FUNDING THAT THE GOVERNOR SECURED FOR HOMELESSNESS WHERE DID THAT COME FROM WHO WHO DID HE SECURE FROM. SURE SO IT WAS FOR- IT'S FOR HOUSING OF COURSE THESE ISSUES ARE INTERTWINED AND IT TOTALS FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SOURCES BUT THE BULK OF IT IS- FROM THE STATE'S BIG TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES INCLUDING APPLE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK. AND ARE THEY GIVING IT TO US OR WE HAVE TO REPAY THAT BACK A CITY SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF GRANTS- AS WELL AS- SUPPORTING OUR LOAN PROGRAM- AT BELOW MARKET RATES. HE AND IT BELOW MARKET RATES DO WE HAVE A NUMBER FOR THAT WITH THAT WOULD BE DON'T HAVE IT WITH ME WE CAN WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON HOW THOSE THAT WAS- SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED STRUCTURE BUT I'M SURE. YOU ON THAT. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I ALSO HAVE. A QUESTION ABOUT AB SIX SEVENTEEN. OF THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM. MICHELINE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PUT INTO THIS PROGRAM AND IT'S NOW BEEN REDUCED TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION. WHICH FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO'S FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR MORE PROTECTION FOR OUR AIR QUALITY AND HOW DO WE REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. HOW TO READ WE REDUCES PARTICULATES JUST CURIOUS WHY IT WAS CUT FROM FIFTY TO TWENTY FIVE. YES SO TO ON THIS ISSUE ONE BE VERY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES THINKING COMMITTEE- PROTECTION IS A KEY PRIORITY- AND SAID THIS WAS. NOTHING TO DO WITH ME EVERY ACTION BEING LESSEN PRIORITY AND MUCH MORE THE FACT THAT OVERALL FUNDING FOR CAP AND TRADE. IS NOT WHAT WE WE'RE NOT PROJECTING IT AT A LEVEL THIS YEAR WHAT WE PRINT WHAT WE HAD FOR LAST YEAR SO SOME OF THE PROGRAMS IN CAP AND TRADE. HOW TO TAKE THEIR CUT OR EVEN BEING BROUGHT DOWN SEEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THAT- AND SO WE'RE HOPING THAT COME A OR YOU KNOW THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS WILL GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW OUR- TEAM CAP AND TRADE REVENUES EVERY YEAR TO CALM AND- IF THEY DO INCREASED AND WE'LL HAVE. MORE RESOURCES TO PUT INTO POSSIBLY BASE AS WELL AS OTHER PROGRAMS THAT TOOK A HAIR CUT. BUT THAT'S THE REASON FOR IT NOT ANY DEITIES IS ON THE- OF THAT PROGRAM OKAY SO JUST PUT A PLUG FOR. WHEN THEY'RE MORE MY REACT. THAT BACKS SO WE HAVE THE MILLION I THERE'S- A THAT OUT. TO THAT IS CLEAN AND LET FREE I THINK BREED AIR THE DAY HOUSE IT'S MY SHOULD BE OUR TOP PRIORITIES. ARE WILL WE LOOK AT PROP NINETY. FUNDING AS CHAIR OF- SENATE ED. I WOULD JUST KIND OF GENTLY CAUTION US WHEN WE SAY THAT EIGHTY FOUR BILLION IS THE MOST WE'VE EVER PUT INTO PROP. NINETY EIGHT WHILE I KNOW THAT IS TRUE. TRUE I THINK THERE ARE MANY OF US THAT. THAT ARE STILL FUND EDGE. AND WE CAL IT IN THE WAY. I'M A PEOPLE WILL THINK OF IT- WE'VE DONE JOB WE'VE GOT ALL THE MONEY WE NEED AN EDUCATION. SO I WOULD JUST CAUTION US THERE- AND THEN THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. IS THERE SOME SPECIFICITY TO THAT DO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT MONEY'S GOING TO GO OR PROGRAMS THAT WILL GO TO. YES SIR THIS IS A PHASED APPROACH ABOUT ONE OF THAT COMMITMENTS- IN THE BUDGET THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOTCHED LAST YEAR WAS WE HAD A- BIG INCREASE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. LAST YEAR BUT IT WAS CONTINGENT IN FUTURE YEARS ON THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING AND WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. ON AN UPDATED FUNDING FORMULA TO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE BEST OUTCOMES FOR THOSE DOLLARS AND HELPING AS MANY PEOPLE IN THE BEST WAYS. AS POSSIBLE SO THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR OR THERE ABOUTS REFLECTS NUMBER ONE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS. BUT MORE THAN THAT AND YOU WAY OF ALLOCATING THE MONEY AND THIS WILL HAPPEN OVER A COUPLE YEARS BUT MY COLLEAGUES ASK I CAN TALK ABOUT. SOME TO KEEP TEAMS IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE ALLOCATING THAT MONEY. WOULD BE GREAT THE S. JUST COMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT WE PROVIDED SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR- SPECIAL EDUCATION OF THAT SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION WENT TO INCREASE THE BASE RATES. OF A CELL BUSINESS SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAD RATES THAT WERE BELOW. ON THE STATEWIDE TARGET RATE FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION WENT- TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE- EXPECTATION THAT WAS USED FOR. THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE YEAR OLDS ANALYST WITH DISABILITIES THAT ARE. TO BE BY. WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS YEAR. WE ARE PRETTY BAD. A NEW. FORMULA THE EIGHT IS THE OVER SEVEN YEARS. WE COMPLETE. CAN BE. BY THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. INCLUDE ALL THAT'S COMPONENT BUT WE'RE- WITH THIS YEAR. IT IS THE BASE FUNDING FORMULA. AND THEN PLANNING ON LOOKING AT ALL THE DIFFERENT SPECIAL EDUCATION CATEGORICAL CENTER ADDED ONTO. TOP OF THAT FUTURE YEARS SO THE BASE. WOULD TAKE THREE YEAR ROLLING OUT. OF SCHOOL THIS. EIGHTY AS OPPOSED% TO THE ONE YEAR. ON EIGHTY EIGHT- OF THE CELL BUT THAT'S CURRENTLY USED- AND THE THREE RULING EVER TO HELP KIND OF. EVEN OUT AND DIPS AND PEAKS IN THE FUNDING- AND THEN THE FUN WOULD STILL GO THROUGH SELFLESS- BUT THE BASE RATE WOULD BE INCREASE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TAKING THAT SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION THAT WE PROVIDED LAST YEAR. AND RULING THAT INTO THE NEW BASE RATE. IN ADDITION THE TUNER FIFTY MILLION THAT- MISTER MISTER NOT BEEN. A REFERENCE WOULD BE FOR- PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. GRAY THAT ALL SOUNDS REALLY GOOD ALL OF IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND ACCOUNTABILITY HOW DO HOW WILL WE MAKE SURE THAT DISTRICTS ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING WITH THE MONEY. THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION- ED I THINK ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT FOLKS ABOUT UP TO US- WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH PEOPLE IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ABOUT SOCIAL EDUCATION IS THE FACT THAT WE HOLD SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE- FOR THEIR STUDENT OUTCOMES IN SPECIAL EDUCATION- BUT THE FUNDING DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE TOP LEVEL. AND SO WE ARE PROPOSING- AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION OF A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. I'M TO CREATE. A WORK GROUP ON AND GOVERNANCE- FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING- AT FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND- FISCAL YEAR- TO PROVIDE US WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE AND STRENGTHEN THE ACCOUNTABILITY- AROUND. THE SPECIAL EDUCATION OUTCOMES AND USE OF FUNDS- AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. THAT SOUNDS GREAT IF I CAN BE HELPFUL IN ANY WAY PLEASE LET ME KNOW ONE LAST QUESTION. DID I READ CORRECTLY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW. CHILD CARE. ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE ALSO THERE IS A NEW DEPARTMENT OF EARLY. DEVELOPMENT OKAY YES AND THAT WOULD BE WITHIN HHS AGENCY AND BASICALLY RESULTED FROM THE SENSE THAT SOME OF THESE DEPARTMENTS WERE SCATTERED OR IN DIFFERENT PLACES SO WE WANT TO BRING. MOST OF THOSE CHILD CARE FUNCTIONS UNDER ONE ROOF AND THE EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION WILL BE SPENT FOR THAT DEPARTMENT I BELIEVE SO YES I CAN DOUBLE CHECK THE FIGURE BUT IT'S T GET THAT- GET THAT DEPARTMENT GOING. IN AND I JUST YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU DEPARTMENTS ARE GREAT AND MUCH NEEDED BUT I WONDER IF THAT EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION COULD BE BETTER SPENT- FIXING THE DEPARTMENT WE ALREADY HAVE I DON'T KNOW- BUT I JUST WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS THAT WE'RE NOT SPENDING MONEY. THAT THEY COULD MAKE THE DEPARTMENT BETTER AND THEN WE'RE CREATING ANOTHER BUREAUCRACY SELF JUST A COMMENT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU JUST BEFORE I GO ON- TO CENTER NIELSEN IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON THE- ECT QUESTION- ASK BY- SENATOR LEYVA- WHILE I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL TEN THOUSAND SLOTS FOR PRESCHOOL. YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. AS I RECALL. BOB PRESCHOOL. IS ONE YEAR- AND AS WE KNOW INFANT CARE IS PREMIUM- IT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND HARDEST TO FIND ACROSS THE STATE. AND SO IN THE INTENTION ON CONTINUING TO LOOK AT ADDITIONAL SLOTS FOR ZERO TO THREE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I THINK OUR GOAL IS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE TO MAKE SURE CHILDREN ARE SCHOOL READY. AND YOU COULD HAVE THE ABSOLUTE BEST PRESCHOOL EXPERIENCE. UP POSSIBLE BUT IF YOU HAVE NOT INVESTED ZERO THREE YOU CAN CATCH UP IN ONE YEAR. AND SO ANY ADDITIONAL AND- IDEAS OR CONCEPTS AROUND. THE EXPANSION OF SLOTS FOR ZERO TO THREE. SO THAT WILL- GENERALLY DEPEND ON AVAILABLE REVENUE SO WE'LL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT IN MAY. THANK YOU. SENATOR NELSON. THE HOMELESS INITIATIVE AND FOCUS IT IS REPORTED THAT THERE WILL BE SOME TRACKING IS THAT BEEN DECIDED HOW THAT WILL BE DONE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IF WHAT WE ARE DOING IS HAVING OR- SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. YES THAT'S CORRECT WE'RE GONNA LOOK CLOSELY BOTH THAT THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS THAT'S FLOWING TEARS CITIES COUNTIES CONTINUUM'S OF CARE THAT IS ONE TIME FUNDING SO- BEFORE THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT FLOWS THAT WAY SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE ENTITIES WE WANT TO SEE HOW WE'RE SPENDING THIS MONEY. ON HOW YOU MEASURE IT THOUGH SAY AGAIN HOW DO YOU MEASURE IT HOW YOU MEASURE A SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OUTCOMES BUT IN TERMS OF WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GETTING SHELTERED WHETHER THEY'RE TRANSITIONING TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- WE OF COURSE NEED A DOCTOR THIS MORNING WAS OUT ON THE STREET IN AT FOUR IN THE MORNING YOU KNOW. GETTING THE P. I. TO DETECT COUNT- SO THEIR NUMBER OF IMPORTANT METRICS THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT. ANOTHER ASPECT OF IT AS I UNDERSTAND. THAT IF VOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO NOT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE STATE THAT WILL BE SOME SANCTIONS IMPOSED OF THOSE BEEN DECIDED WHAT SANCTIONS WILL BE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO I THINK YOU MAY BE REFERRING- TO A PROPOSAL- FROM- THAT THAT GOVERNOR'S DISCUSSED WITH SOME OF THE ADVISORS- TO HIM ON HOMELESSNESS REGARDING- PUTTING IN OBLIGATIONS- FOR. LOCAL AND OUR STATE AND TO DECIDE TO. HOUSE THE HOMELESSNESS OR AND DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY- THE GOVERNOR HAS- EMBRACE THE GENERAL IDEA OF DOING SOMETHING BIG HERE BUT HE'S ALSO BAGHDAD THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE SO I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE DETAILS TO COME ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A BIT OF AN- IRONY HERE. A PART OF OUR PROBLEM OUR LOCAL CAN STUDENT BY THE TICKET LET BRANCH OF ON. TO REALIGN. AND THEN PUNISH THEM FOR NOT MEETING OUR- OF WHAT WE HAVE PUBLISHED ON THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A BURDEN I THINK OF THIS HE MENTIONED A BIT OF A DOLLAR FOR POST REACH LEAST. NOW THERE'S VERY LITTLE OR MUCH POST. REALLY SUPER NOW BOTH REALIGN. THE SO WHAT PHARMACISTS TO TAKE IS THIS MORE TO THE PROBE. DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTIES. YES SO- I LIKE SHALL HAVE A COLLEAGUE OF MINE SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THAT IT'S A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL IT'S ON TOP OF THAT PROBATION PROPOSALS THAT I WAS DISCUSSING- BUT THEY CAN TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE MORE IF YOU WOULD BE TO. THE SKY. KERN COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- THE THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS A REFLECTION THAT- AT THE STATE LEVEL WHEN THERE ARE POPULATION CHANGES- MORE PEOPLE ARE RELEASED AND THEREFORE THERE'S MORE PEOPLE IN POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION SO THAT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. IS REFLECTIVE OF A SHORT TERM BUBBLE THAT WAS CREATED BY PROP FIFTY SEVEN BY. PEOPLE EARNING MORE CREDITS AND THEN THOSE RELEASES GENERATING MORE PEOPLE ON HERE CS SO THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A MULTI YEAR EFFORT TO FIND THAT MOBILE. FOR COUNTIES- AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE IT'LL SORT OF PLATEAU AND WE'LL GO BACK TO A NORMAL HOMEOSTASIS LEVEL. OKAY WELL THE JUST BE ADVISED I HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS REDUCING THE PROBATION PERIODS AT CETERA- I DON'T BY THE LOGIC THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO RESULT IN. BETTER REHABILITATION OR SUCCESS. ON FOR BUT THAT'S UP ON PROBATION THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PLACE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THREE RESPONSE THERE. OF THE IN THIS BUDGET THERE'S A BIT LESS MONEY FOR WHAT WE CALL DEBT REDUCTION IS THAT BECAUSE THE- EXTRA MONEY IS BLESSED AND IN THIS BUDGET THAN SOME PREVIOUS ONES. IT SEEMS LIKE. AND YOU DID MENTION FOR EXAMPLE THAT TO ACCELERATING THE OF PENSION REDUCTIONS THAT WOULD BE. PRIOR DONE ALREADY SO NOTHING NEW- BUT DESERVED IT IS THAT THE REASON THAT WE YOU'RE ANTICIPATING LESS SURPLUS MONEY. I THINK I NUMBER ONE IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER ALTHOUGH STILL NOT INSIGNIFICANT- SURPLUS OVERALL- BUT NUMBER TWO IS THE FACT THAT- YOU TO PROPOSITION TWO IS STILL IN EFFECT SO WE'VE STILL GOT. BOTH OUR DEPOSIT OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE RAINY DAY FUND AS WELL AS OUR- TO DEBT PAYMENTS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY PROJECTING. OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD- IN THE YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR UNDER PROPOSITION TWO THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT ONE. BILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT TO THAT WOULD BE TO CALPERS A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT AT THE SCALE THAT WE SAW LAST YEAR BUT OF COURSE THE PAYMENTS THAT WE MADE LAST YEAR WILL BENEFIT THE STATE FOR YEARS TO COME. AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD. PRESERVE SOCIETY REMBRANDT BY. I SHOULD ACT LAST YEAR. WE ARE PROJECT AROUND NINE. DON'T DOLLARS OF RESEARCH IN THIS YEAR WE'RE- TO ONE DOLLAR DOLLARS IN THANK YOU. UP PS PS. THIS JUST MY OPINION. BE A WAY OF LIFE NEW NORM AND CAL. IT'S TO JUST FOR. OF THE- PUBLIC. BUT THAT SAID- OUR SPECIAL DISH. BASED TO BE- NOT MENTIONED IN TERMS OF THESE PUBLIC SAFETY THE NOTIFICATION MONIES THAT ARE COMING FOR PROFESSIONAL DISTANCE MONEY WILL GO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT IT IS ARE GOING TO BE ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE SUCH SPECIAL DISTRICTS BEING A PART OF THAT. SAW SPEAK GENERALLY TERRA HOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING ABOUT THAT MONEY AND THEN MY TALK TO RESET MAIL EVERY AS WELL AS SO IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET YET SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A AND THIS YEAR IT'S AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR WHAT WE'RE CALLING. COMMUNITY RESILIENCE- WHICH IS P. S. P. S. AS YOU MENTIONED AND I THINK THE FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT GOVERNOR'S MADE CLEAR HE AGREES. WITH YOUR SENTIMENT THAT THIS CANNOT BE A WAY OF LIFE AND SO HE'S SPENDING HOURS AND HOURS WITH HIS SENIOR ADVISERS THINKING ABOUT THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UTILITIES EMERGES PROVIDE SAFER FIVE AFFORDABLE RELIABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY- AND SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S- EVEN IF IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. CANNOT BE WAY OF LIFE. AND THEN THE SECOND THING BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR- THE BUDGET INCLUDES AT FIFTY NINE DOLLARS WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON SCHOOLS COUNTY VOTED VOTING OFFICES IN CASE- WE WERE TO EXPERIENCE THAT. YES YES. THE FACT. AND IT FINALLY FOR BANKS IN FOOD STORE BECAUSE KNOW THAT'S IN. OF NEED PARTICULARLY DURING THAT TYPE OF THAT SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR SWEETS. DO NOT TAKE. AT THE MOMENT WHEN WE NEED THEM MOST. AND MY COLLEAGUE THERESA MAY COLLABORATE AS WELL THANK YOU. THIRTY SIX HOUR WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IT IS SPECIFIED THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING SPECIAL DISTRICTS WOULD- BE- CONSIDER FOR THESE FUNDS SO IN A LANGUAGE THE- IT WILL BE MENTIONED SPECIAL DISTRICTS OF WORDS WILL OCCUR. IN THE IN THE- LANGUAGE AND OPEN THE TRAILER BILL OR IN THE BUDGET. RIGHT IN THE IN THE BUDGETING PROPOSAL THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS- REQUEST IT IS MENTIONED THERE. WE DON'T HAVE ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AT THIS TIME BUT- OUR PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE SPECIAL DISTRICTS. NOW IS MONEY FLOWS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ALSO INCLUDED THE- FOR MONIES. I AM NOT SURE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE CONSIDERED SPECIAL DISTRICTS WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT TIME THAT SPECIFIC I DON'T THINK THEY ARE BUT I WOULD JUST DIG KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE VERY HELPFUL AND VERY IMPORTANT. AS WE MOVE INTO THIS PARTICULAR AREA. OF THE I MENTIONED IN MY- BRIEF INTRODUCTORY. ABOUT THE CONSOLIDATIONS OF THE CREATION OF NEW DEPARTMENTS. OF IS IT ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WILL BE NO NET INCREASE IN P. WHY IS WITH THESE REORGANIZATIONS IF YOU WILL OR THE CREATION OF NEW ENTITIES OR THE RENAMING OF ENTITIES. HOW WHAT WHAT SAID IN A LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF. JUST THE- NUMBER OF STATE EMPLOYEES. YES SO SOME OF THESE ARE CONSOLIDATIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOME OF THEM ARE NEW LINES OF THAT BUSINESS OF LIKE THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION WORK THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO DO FOR EXAMPLE OR INCREASES TO OUR CYBER SECURITY CAPABILITIES- OR THE WILD FIRES RIGHT INTELLIGENCE IN INTEGRATION CENTER. TO SOME OF THESE ENTITIES WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AND SPENDING- AT THE SAME TIME WE HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE CONSOLIDATIONS- YOU MAY HAVE A VERY SIMILAR LEVELS EMPLOYEES AND SPENDING TO WHAT YOU HAD BEFORE. BUT HOPEFULLY A BETTER LEVEL OF SERVICE SO THAT CERTAINLY THE IDEA YES IS BETTER YEAH I WAS JUST GOING TO A SUPPLEMENT THAT CENTER MEALS AND WITH- THE FACT THAT WE THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT- BLINDS OF DISCUSSION THE YOU MAY HAVE THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT. THE ADDITION OF SOME DEPARTMENTS CONSOLIDATIONS. ALL OF THE ESTIMATES THAT I TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARD TO THE FUTURE OF OPERATING POSITION OF THE STATE'S BUDGET DO NOT REALLY TAKE THOSE INTO ACCOUNT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WOULD ADD TO ONGOING COST THEY'RE NOT REFLECTED IN THAT. AND SO WHAT ELSE MANY OF THEM HAVE GOOD IDEAS BEHIND THEM WE THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF IT FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT TO TAKE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. THE END I WOULD VICE AT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SHOULD AS WELL THE- THERE'S NOT. IS BEEN DURING IS A NEWLY CREATE. STATE AGENCY. END OF THE THAT'S JUST SOMETHING WE HAVE TO ACCEPT SO WE HAVE TO BE. I I'M ARGUING TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT- DIMENSION BROADBAND EXPANSION- VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THAT BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL YESTERDAY THE BROADBAND PLAN IS IN WITHIN OUR FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN AND THAT MOST OF THE MONEY FOR THIS COMES FROM SPECIAL FUNDS THAT'S NOT COMING FROM. GENERAL FUND TAX PROCEEDS BUT% FUNDS- WITHIN THE QC OR RELATED ENTITIES AND BASICALLY. IT'S ABOUT NAPPING THE STATE OF CONNECTIVE ITTY IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE- AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT WERE DEPLOYING RESOURCES INCLUDING A BIG INVESTMENT FOR SCHOOLS BECAUSE THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF BROADBAND CANNOT CONNECTIVITY. BUT ALSO IN OTHER AREAS WHERE WE THINK THE FUNDING TO MAKE THE BIGGEST IMPACT AND PLEASE ANYONE ELABORATE YES. THE MIDDLE PART OF FINANCES THE BUDDING A- DOLLARS LESS THAN NINE HUNDRED MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS FOR BROADBAND PURPOSES. OKAY THAT'S THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND I THANK YOU WE'VE HAD SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH THAT AND RURAL AREAS FOR SURE. LASTLY LOCAL JAILS. THE REALIGNMENT AND OTHER THINGS INCLUDING INITIATIVES HAVE RESULTED IN A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LOCAL JAILS. BUT ONE ON Sí MOMENT. IS THE IMPACT OF INMATE LAWSUITS THAT HAVE MARCHED FROM THE STATE PRISONS OUT INTO OUR LOCAL JAILS FRESNO COUNTY WAS ONE OF THE FIRST HIT RIGHT AFTER REALIGNMENT. AND THE JAILS ARE NOW BEING REQUIRED OR BEING ASKED TO. DO THINGS THAT THEY'VE NEVER BEEN DESIGNED TO DO. HOW OR VISIT MINISTRATION LOOKING AT THAT THE LOOMING CRISIS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES DEALING WITH THESE POPULATIONS IN OUR JAILS AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE HOUSING AND MANAGER OF THOSE POPULATIONS. YES ALL MENTION TWO THINGS BRIEFLY BUT THEN- MY COLLEAGUE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL OPERATE I THINK THE FIRST IS THAT- THE GOVERNOR SIGNAL BOTH IN THE BUDGET EIGHT PAGES AND PRESS CONFERENCE AT LOCAL JAIL OVERSIGHT WILL BE A PRIORITY OF HIS- AND THEN SECOND- WHEN IT COMES TO HER PROBATION REFORM SPECIFICALLY- MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF JAILS- AS- ALONG SIDE STATE PRISON. YOU ARE NOT CYCLING BACK INTO THE SYSTEM- BUT THE FOR DELIBERATE. PLEASE THANK YOU ROBERT NELSON PART OF FINANCE. THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING. WASTE INCREASED OVERSIGHT. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES WAY IS THAT CAN BE DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY LIKE WHAT YOU PROVIDED A SHAWL GUIDANCE. ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT- RE REPORTS THEY'RE BORED ENHANCE FOLLOW UP WITH FACILITIES. AS WELL AS LORD YOU SEE BORDERED WITH BORDER CORRECTIONS. YES FOR CORRECTIONS SORRY BUT COMMITTED IS STRANGELY INCREASE INSPECTION REPORTS- BREEN REPORTS TO THE BOARD MEETINGS HAS ALSO IF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL AS THEY CONTINUE THEIR EVALUATION WILL BRING THAT FORWARD AND DISCUSS THAT. WELL I'D SUBMIT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED THE SPECTER LA- HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THIS JAIL SITUATION AT ALL YET YOUR DEPARTMENT- WE- WE- LOW- MY COLLEAGUE DREW IS PROBABLY. FESTIVAL TO A. SO TOWARD LEGISLATIVE IN WE ARE IN THE OF LOOKING AT THE LEVEL OF JAIL OVERSIGHT THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PLACE FOR JAILS AND MODELS THAT EXISTS AROUND THE STATE TO HELP ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE ON WHATEVER PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION COMES FORWARD THE OTHER THING THAT I'D ADD THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTICE THE STATE HAS PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN FUNDING FOR JAIL CONSTRUCTION COM TO COUNTIES ALL OVER THE STATE A LOT OF THIS FUNDING WAS INTENDED TO HELP RETROFIT JAILS TO- MAKE THE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR LONGER TERM PLACEMENTS THAT STARTED OCCURRING AFTER THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. BUT I'D ARGUE THAT THE IMPACTS ARE ACCELERATING VIA THE LAWSUITS AND MY POINT IS WE NEED TO BE ATTENDED TO THAT. THE TWO OF THE- THANK YOU MANAGER. CENTER LIKE ASKING. PICKING UP ON THE CONSOLIDATION REORGANIZATION SINCE I USED TO DO THAT BEFORE I GOT HERE MISTER PECK. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME ADVICE HERE BECAUSE HIS FAVORITE THROUGH THE INITIAL DOCUMENT IT SEEMS SOME OF THIS IS IN FACT. REALLY GOVERNMENT EXPANSION I MEAN THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION WHICH I HAVE A BILL ON LICENSING DEBT COLLECTOR SOME HAVE SOME INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT MATTER LOOKS LIKE A GROWING. STATE GOVERNMENT IN ITS FORTY FOUR POSITIONS- THIS FIRST YEAR NINETY POSITIONS IN NEXT YEAR BUT SOME OF IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE CHANGING THE LAWN FURNITURE MOVING IT FROM HERE TO THERE AND IT'S JUST IT'S AND IT HAS A HUGE COST. HAS HUGE COST THE GOVERNMENT HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE US CANCERS HELIO ON TO LOOK AT EACH AND EVERYONE OF THESE CONSOLIDATIONS REORGANIZATIONS RENAMING SOME OF IT JUST LOOKS LIKE. WE'RE IT'S THE SAME FUNCTION. YES SENATOR WIECKOWSKI I MEAN WE- WITH RESPECT WE ALSO HAD QUESTIONS. AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. WILL BE AT THE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER BECAUSE- YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED IN THE MULTI YEAR OUTLET- THE ESTIMATES REALLY DON'T ACCOUNT FOR THAT SO THERE COULD BE HIGHER COST AND WHAT WERE SEEN SO WE THINK THERE. I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME KIND OF GLOBAL FIGHTS THE YOU MAY WANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU THINK THROUGH THIS ONE IS YOU KNOW WITH THE REORGANIZATION LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVENESS OR BETTER SERVICES. WOULD IT- INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE THE CHANGES IN WHATEVER PARTICULAR- DEPARTMENT THE THIRD DISCUSSING- YOU KNOW. WITH THAT AND THERE'S ALSO A PUBLIC RELATIONS ELEMENT TO IT HOW WITH THE PUBLIC RELATE TO THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD IT WOULDN'T ALTER THAT- CONNECTION THAT THEY HAVE IN A WAY THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND SO THEY'RE SORT OF A- A PUBLIC FACING ELEMENT TO THIS. AND THEN- THE- WE ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S A CO ABOUT HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION PLAN TO EFFECTUATE THESE CHANGES WOULD BE THROUGH TRAILER BILL-LANGUAGE OR WOULD IT BE THROUGH. FROM FROM THE- THE INTENT OF THE REORGANIZATION OR THE NEW DEPARTMENTS THE- OBJECTIVES THAT ARE- HOPE TO BE ACHIEVED WITH IT. AND THEN ALSO HOW IT WOULD BE PUT INTO A FACT THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT I THINK SHOULD PROBABLY- SERVICE THE BACKDROP TO ANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. ANYTHING THAT MR THIS MORNING OFTEN. IS THE MAIN THING IS WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING THE DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE I WILL SAY THAT- FOR SOME THE ENTITIES LIKE THAT PROPOSED CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION THAT YOU MENTIONED- THOSE WOULD BE FUNDED OUT OF PECIAL FUNDS- SO WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE COMPETING. WITH OTHER GENERAL FUND RESOURCES- AND THEN I THINK THAT TWO OTHER POINTS ALL MAKE MORE BROADLY ARE NUMBER ONE YEAH I CERTAINLY I THINK EVERY PROPOSAL OF OURS AND SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO THE ORGANIZATION- DESERVE SCRUTINY. I DO THINK THAT FOR SOME OF THE KEY PRIORITY AREAS FOR EXAMPLE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OR CANNABIS WERE RIGHT OR SETTING UP A NEW REGIME- OR SOMETHING THAT'S VERY RECENT OR SOMETHING WHERE THE ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IS CHANGING AND WE WANT TO ADOPT WITH THAT- WE DO THINK THAT IT MAKES SENSE. EVEN IF IT DOES INVOLVE MOVING DEPARTMENTS- FROM OR DIVISIONS FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER AND I GUESS THAT'S WHERE THE BROADER POINT- WHICH CENTER NIELSEN AND ALSO MENTIONED IN ITS OWN WAY IT OFTEN AND GOVERNMENTS WHEN YOU CREATE SOMETHING. IT STAYS THERE AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANNA SHUFFLED DEPARTMENTS ARE A AT AROUND FOR DIVISIONS FOR THE SECOND SHUFFLING BUT IF IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO OBJECT GOVERNMENT FOR THE NEEDS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AD. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD WANT TO PROPOSE. CAN THE CONCERN FIND. OUR PROTECTION BUREAU USED REGULATION HE WON'T HAVE MORE REGULATION THIS OBVIOUSLY I HAVE AN INTEREST IN LICENSING DIED AND TO INTRODUCE BILL THE THAT BUT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT REGISTRATION WHAT DO YOU GUYS AND THE THIS IS THE EARLY STAGES ON WHAT. DEREGULATION SCARE SOME PEOPLE OF HER ENOUGH. MORE REGULATION I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD OR WHAT'S THE GOAL. I SEE MORE LOOKING AT THE CONSUMER RIGHT YES AND SO THE FIRST BROADER POINT I'LL MAKE FOR THIS SPECIFIC ENTITIES THAT ACTION THIS CASE ALTHOUGH IT ISN'T THAT I MENTIONED IT MYSELF ANALOGOUS TO THE CFPB IN MANY AYS. THE CFPB IS AN INDEPENDENT FEDERAL BUREAU IN THIS CASE WE'RE NOT PROPOSING CREATING A BRAND NEW- AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT THIS WOULD BE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT RATHER IT'S GIVING THAT NEW POSITIONS FORTY FOUR AS YOU MENTIONED. AND NEW POWERS WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIFICALLY WHAT THOSE POWERS ARE AT I THINK I WOULD SUB SEPARATE THEM INTO FOUR GENERAL AREAS IN ONE CERTAINLY IS THIS- ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING AND REGULATION AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN THINK ABOUT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT OCCASION AND- HOLDING PEOPLE TO ACCOUNT. AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT THAT CERTAINLY NOT THE WHOLE EXTENT OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE IN ADDITION- THERE IS THE AREA OF SUPERVISION WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND LICENSING. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT CITY SO THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO AFTER THEM WHEN THEY'RE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW- THE THIRD AREA IS ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT OF PLACES YOU KNOW. THERE'S FINANCIAL INNOVATION BUT THERE'S ALSO FINANCIAL FRAUD INNOVATION AND PARTICULARLY IN AN ERA THAT WE LIVE IN WHICH YOU KNOW BLOCK CHAIN AND FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED A GOVERNMENT- FUNCTION THAT IS LOOKING AT WE ARE ALL THIS IS GOING IN ANALYZING WHERE WE NEED TO PUT MORE RESOURCES AND NEW TYPES OF PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TO ATTACK. AND THEN FINALLY THE LAST AREA BUT CERTAINLY WE SEE PUBLIC AWARENESS WHICH IS EASY TO. DOWN BUT CERTAINLY PEOPLE ARE APPLYING FOR LOANS ARE APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL PRODUCTS YOU WANT TO REGULATE AND SUPERVISE- THE ENTITY THAT IS PROVIDING THOSE PRODUCTS BUT IT ALSO HELPS IF THE CONSUMER THEMSELVES AS AS EDUCATED AS POSSIBLE AND AS WARY- AS TO WHAT NOT TOUCH THE PRICE MIGHT BE VULNERABLE. SO WE SEE ALL THOSE FUNCTIONS RELEVANT THIS NEW THE WITHIN TO BE. OUT SO WHAT'S- THE- GOVERNOR'S ROCK CLIMB BUDGET SO WE'RE AT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR YOUR- FUNNY THING. IS MY- YEAR. IN THE ON THE BUDGET. AND EACH YEAR WHETHER WAS BROWN TO MINUTES. THE NEW SEMESTER. THEY PROPOSE. REVENUES FROM CAPTAIN TREAT BEING ABOUT TWO POINT THREE TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND EVERY YEAR SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE IT COMES IN BETWEEN THREE POINT FOUR AND THREE POINT SIX. SO FOR THE MISTER PATRICK- WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS ON REVENUES BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING OR READ ANYTHING THAT SOMETHING IN THE MARKETS CHANGING THAT WOULD GIVEN THE SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY THREE CENTS WHATEVER THE- WHATEVER THE FLOW OF THE- ALLOWANCES FOR THE COST IS ON THE BUDGET ONE. IS TO THE CHANGE THAT WOULD MAKE THE REVENUES GO DOWN WELL I MEAN I THINK OUR NUMBERS ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR TO THE ADMINISTRATION BRIAN- BRIAN BROWN MY PEOPLE TO HELP. GOOD MORNING BRIAN. GOOD MORNING BRIAN BROWN WITH THE LA L. I OUR- REVENUE ESTIMATES FOR CAP AND TRADE. ARE PRETTY SIMILAR TO THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE- ALLOWANCE PRICES- BUT BOTH OF OUR MODELS ASSUME THAT ALL OUR TO SELL- AND THE CURRENT PRICE IS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE FLOOR. THERE WERE SOME HANDS AT LEAST FOR THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YOU WERE PRETTY CLOSE. WHAT COULD CHANGE GOING FORWARD IS REALLY- THE THAT THAT PRICE SO IF ALLOWING PRICES GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY THAT WILL GENERATE MORE REVENUE. OF COURSE REMIND MEMBERS SAY 60% OF. CAP AND TRADE REVENUES ARE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SO WHATEVER ADDITIONAL REVENUES COME IN IT LESS THAN HALF THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR. THOSE THE DISCRETIONARY- EXPENDITURES- WE WILL HAVE TO MORE OPTIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO WE WILL KNOW BEFORE THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR WHAT THE EXACT. LEVEL REVENUE IS- THAT'S AVAILABLE- GOING INTO THE NEW FISCAL YEAR BUT OF COURSE IT IS A PROJECTION GOING FORWARD AFTER THAT. YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE IN THEIR WISDOM WHEN THEY SET UP THE CAPTAIN TREAT THEY GAVE THE AUTHORITY TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. DEAR RESOURCE BOARD RIGHT NOW HAS THE AUTHORITY TODAY TO SET THE PRICE OF THE ALLOWANCES BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BUDGET THAT WOULD SUGGEST. A SIGNAL TO THE MARKET THAT WE MAY BE CHANGED RAISING THE PRICE OF THE ALL OF THE OPTIONS. YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIG DISCUSSION OUT THERE ON THE PRICE OF CARBON SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT DOLLARS IS EMBARRASSINGLY LOW. YOU'VE HEARD REPORTS WITH THE LA- THAT HAVE SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD BE IN THE FIFTY TO SIXTY. DOLLARS HOW DO YOU HAVE A CLIMATE POLICY OVER FIVE YEARS FOR TWELVE. MILLION THE TO GIVE US A HAND. OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH SETTING THE PRICE. SO THAT'S JUST A QUESTION BECAUSE YOU COULD COME BACK FOR ON THIS CLIMATE AND YOU COULD COME BACK TO SEPT TWO BUT THERE'S IT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A MEAGER AMOUNT OF REVENUE WHICH YOU CONTROL. RIGHT NOW YOU COULD SAY TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AND THE NEXT OPTION. WOULD NOT ACCEPTING ANY BITS AND THAT WOULD SEND THE PRICE THE MARKET WOULD ALSO SEND THE PRICE FOR WHAT THE REVENUES MAY BE FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO INCREASE FOR THE LAST EIGHTY BE LITTLE QUESTION. PUBLIC THE FINES IN TRAFFIC- FOR THE INDIGENT HERE'S LOOKING AT ELEVEN MILLION. DOLLARS I THINK WAS THAT ALL THE DOLLARS SOB BUT IT'S LIKE. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT THE COURTS. COLLECT IS GIGANTIC I MEAN IT'S- I DIDN'T SEE THAT THE OFFSET THE LOSS THAT THE IF THE- ALLOW INDIGENT PEOPLE NOT TO PAY THEIR FINES WITCH HUNTS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. IT'S MUCH MORE THAN ELEVEN MILLION WE'RE WHAT IS THE COURTS TO WHAT THE. MISSING GAP OF WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE NOT COLLECTING IN THE ELEVEN MILLION THIS PEN IDENTIFIED YES SO I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT PROGRAM WE'RE PROPOSING AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE ANNE JARVIS- MAY AT SOME COMMENTS AS WELL SO. YOU ARE RIGHT WHEN YOU ADD UP ALL THESE FINES AND FEES FOR YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING IN EXCESS OF A BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT IN SO THIS IS YOU KNOW A SMALL PART OF THAT I THINK OF WHAT WE GOVERNOR'S POPOSING IS NUMBER ONE EXPANDING A PILOT WHICH WAS A PILOT PROGRAMS. THAT STARTED LAST YEAR IT WAS FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS AND THE FINES AND FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FOR LOW INCOME AN INDIVIDUAL INDIGENT INDIVIDUALS OR INTERACTING WITH THE COURT SYSTEM- SO THIS WOULD EXPAND THAT PILOTS STATEWIDE- EXPANDED TO INCLUDE SOME NON TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON. LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS- BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A PROPOSAL- TO WHITE SUEDE COMPLETELY CLEAN WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE FINES AND FEES- BECAUSE THAT WOULD TAKE THE LEVEL FUNDING THAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING IT'S RATHER TO EASE THE BURDEN AND INCREASE THE RELIEF THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS OVER TIME. SIR SERVICE TO. FINANCE AND- THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANTED TO ADD WAS THAT THAT ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IS THE PORTION RELATIVE TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND IT DOES GO TO FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AND OVER AT OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD AND WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS- OR THE NUMBER I'M SORRY THE REVENUE BACK FILL IS BASED ON THE PILOT TODAY AND ITS OPERATING ONLY IN FOR COURT SO- HARD TO. JUDGE WHETHER OR NOT AND- THIS IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT BUT WILL ADJUST AS WE GO FORWARD BUT SINCE FOR EXPANDING TO ALL COURTS AND WE- THE- IT. PHASES ANIMALS OUT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. THAT'S THE BACK FILL OR EXPECTING. THANK YOU SIR SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HI AND WELCOME BACK MR RESPONSE ON AND- MISTER PECK THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK. TWO ISSUES I WANT TO FOCUS ON FIRST. ONE IS FOR THE CONTINUE TO CLIMB A CONVERSATION THAT CENTER Y. CASKEY STARTED- WITH A LITTLE DIFFERENT LANES I KNOW LAST. LAST YEAR WE HAD IT IS THE SAME OVERVIEW HEARING IN. MY QUESTION IS STILL THE SAME. WHICH IS VIEWING CLIMATE IN A FISCAL LENDS NOT JUST AS A CATEGORY FOR EXPENDITURES HER FOR MITIGATION BUT LOOKING AT IT AS A LIABILITY I CAN TO OTHER LIABILITIES AND DEBTS WE HAVE IS A STATE THAT. WILL IN THEORY GROW SUBSTANTIALLY OVER TIME I KNOW WE DO A PRETTY THOROUGH ANALYSIS ON OUR PENSIONS AND RETIREMENT- OTHER DEBTS THAT- ME A CREW OVER OVER- COURSE OF DECADES. BUT MY BIG CONCERN IS THAT. WE'VE NOT YET TO MY KNOWLEDGE ANALYZED WHAT CLIMATE WRIT LARGE COULD POSE TO THE STATE BUDGET- I KNOW THAT THE FOURTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT DID SORT OF LOOK AT SOME VERY HIGH LEVEL NUMBERS IS A STATE FOR WHAT WE COULD BE SEEING SAY OUT TO TWENTY FIFTY OR EVEN THE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED- BUT I'M WONDERING IF ANY FURTHER ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE- SAY ON THE- THIS YEAR BASIS BUT MAYBE ON A FIVE OR TEN YEAR PROJECTION OF. WHAT KIND OF UNFORESEEN EXPENDITURES WE MIGHT BE FACING IF WE DON'T JUST GET YOUR FIRES BUT WE ALSO GET A YEAR OF FIRES AND A YEAR WITH A SUPER FLOOD- ON TOP OF THAT DROUGHT. USGS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THEIR RECENT PROJECTIONS BUT YOU KNOW THEIR MODEL THEY MODEL ARC STORM RIGHT WHICH IS JUST ONE FLOOD INCIDENT ALONE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR EVENT MEANTIME AT THE MOST CATASTROPHIC EVENT. IN THE NATION IS SITTING RIGHT HERE STARTING IN SACRAMENTO IF WE GET THE WRONG KIND OF ATMOSPHERE COLLISION ALL THE SAME TIME. THAT'S AN EXTREME EXAMPLE BUT IT'S A LIKELIHOOD ACCORDING THEIR MODELING- AND SO. WHAT WHAT EFFORTS HAVE WE MADE THIS SORT OF ANALYZE WHAT THOSE LONG TERM LIABILITIES COULD BE AND PLAN FOR THEM BECAUSE I'M LOOKING HERE. AT THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT OR EVEN THE SFE YOU RIGHT SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES WHERE IT A PROPOSED ONE POINT SIX BILLION OVERALL SAFETY NET INCLUDED ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY ONE BILLION. OKAY YOU ADD FIRE AND FLOOD ALONE HE WIPED THAT FORGET RAINY DAY FUND FLOOD FUND  WIPE SO WE STARTED LOOKING AT THIS QUESTION THROUGH A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SURE SO I CAN SPEAK TO THAT SO WE'RE CERTAINLY THINKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT ALL THE RISKS- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAD THE KIND OF THAT QUANTIFICATION EFFORT THAT I KNOW GUY YOU'VE DISCUSSED BUT ONE THING I WILL SAY THAT IS DIFFERENT FOR THIS YEAR. IS THAT I KNOW CENTER WHAT BECAUSE HE TALKED ABOUT THE CLIMATE BUDGET AND THAT SOME THAT'S NOT A TERM THAT WE'VE USED LAST YEAR THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN BEFORE AND THE REASON WE WANTED TO PUT ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER IS BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THIS PRIORITIES IMPORTANT THAT PRIORITIES IMPORTANT WE ACTUALLY WANTED TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND THAT WAY. WE ARE BASICALLY IN OUR PROPOSED SPENDING PLAN MAKING AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE RISKS REALLY ARE AND WHERE WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY AND SO THE THREE COMPONENTS OF THAT ARE THAT CLIMATE CATALYST FIND CAP AND TRADE AND THEN THE PROPOSED CLIMATE RESILIENCE BOND AND I KNOW THERE'S ALSO A PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE FOR SOMEWHERE BOND AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE ALLOCATION. OF OUR MONEY AMONG THOSE THREE POCKETS THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE SENSE OF HOW THE MINISTRATION SEEING THEIR BREASTS AND WHERE WE WANT TO INVEST WE KNOW THAT THE FINAL APPLICATION AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF THAT CLIMB RESULT FUNDING PARTICULAR WILL DEPEND ON THE- SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. COMMENTS HERE. ONE ONE THING I DON'T THAT WE THE THIS TIME NECESSARILY A GLOBAL LONG TERM ESTIMATE OF THE LATE OF KIND THAT YOU REFERRING TO BUT WHAT A COUPLE OF POINTS I WOULD MAKE IT- WE DID TAKE THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME KIND OF A NATURAL DISASTER OCCURRING INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE DID OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK IN NOVEMBER AND THERE IS THE YOU KNOW THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING- FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS TO FEMA SO WE ADDED. A BILLION OR TWO TO THE CAUSTIC COULD COME IN BE FELT BY THE STATE GENERAL FUND AND YOU KNOW I THINK JUST TO KIND OF REITERATE- POINT THAT EVEN ONE OR TWO OF THOSE KIND OF EVENTS COULD JEOPARDIZE THE OPERATING SURPLUS JUST IN THE NEAR TERM AND THAT'S ONLY ONE. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE RISKS THAT ARE OUT THERE- BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I THINK MORE INFORMATION. OF THE KIND THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PROBABLY YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DRILL DOWN FURTHER ON THAT AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS AND I KNOW OF I THINK OUR OUR FIRST SPECIFIC HEARING WILL BE ON CLIMATE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN. SO WILL DRILL DOWN MORE ON THAT THEN BUT- I WOULD I WOULD JUST CLOSE AT THAT POINT BY SAYING. THE REACTIVE INSERT A RESPONSIVE CAPACITY DO DISASTER IS ONE THING ANSWER TO HAVING THAT SURGE CAPACITY BUILT IN SAY WE GET. AN INCIDENT I MEAN I THINK WE DID FIVE BILLION LAST YEAR IN WILD FIRE RESPONSE OF WE GET HIT. OUT OF THE BLUE WITH ANOTHER SERIES FIRES IN A FLOOD. IF TO COME UP WITH FIFTEEN BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTING HOW WE BY DOWN THAT RISK. RIGHT AND LOOKING AT THE GOVERNOR'S BOND PROPOSAL THROUGH THAT LENS THAT'S REALLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE. TRYING TO ANALYZE IT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK THAT REALLY OUGHT TO BE THE TEST. IF YOU'RE GONNA SPEND FIVE BILLION HOW MUCH RISK YOU ACTUALLY GONNA BUY DOWN SEEM AS MATH IS FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT N DISASTER. AVOIDANCE YOU'RE GOING TO SAVEABOUT SIX DOLLARS ON THE BACK IT RIGHT IN DISASTER RESPONSE MUCH EASIER PREVENT ONE. THAT ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE ONE SO- THANK YOU FOR LOOKING FURTHER AT THAT AND- YEAH WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP SOON AND I THINK YOU'VE GOT A LETTER IN YOUR YOUR- I THINK IT MS FOSLER ACTUALLY IS A LETTER ON THIS FRONT WITH A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. YEAH MISTER PECK I'M SERIOUS NO I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD I MEAN I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT- POINT THAT CONNECTS BACK TO Y. THING TO THE YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE- WEATHER. YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE LEVEL RESERVES FOR PROPOSED A THE GOVERNOR AND THE BUDGET BECAUSE- RIGHT NOW OUR TOTAL RESERVE LEVEL. IS NOT REALLY DIFFERENTIATING AMONG THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RISKS THAT THE STATE COULD FACE WHETHER IT'S- CAN. FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR. I'M CIOTAT YOU. YOU KNOW. THE THAT THE KINDS OF REST YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SENATOR YEAH AND EVEN JUST BILL THAT CAN AND LIKE I SAW THAT YOU ANALYZE TO. BASED ON SAVES NCO TAX APPROVAL. WHAT IF THERE'S FOR MORE FIRES AND FLOODS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE SORT OF AT LEAST GOING THROUGH THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS- LAST THING I WOULD JUST ADD AND THANKS FOR THE INTELLIGENCE MANAGER BUT- YES THERE IS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE OVERSIGHT HEARING ALREADY- WITH DOCTOR PANS. DOES SUBCOMMITTEE LOOKING AT- DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES AND I I'D I DON'T KNOW DID MISTER DID YOU TESTIFY THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE SAID ADD. TO JUST WANT TO GET YOUR HIGH LEVEL TAKE HIS WRIST WANT ON ON- I THINK DOCTOR PAN IT'S SORT OF ASKED ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF PUTTING TOGETHER- A PLAN. TO LOOK AT THE RATE STUDY IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW WE ACTUALLY START TO MEET THIS. HUGE GAP WERE FRANKLY FACING ON DELIVERING THOSE SERVICES SO JUST TO GET A SENSE- SO WE DON'T SIR TO CHASE IT YEAR AFTER YEAR BUT- WHEN YOU GET YOUR FEEL FOR THE FEASIBILITY OF PUTTING THAT KIND OF PLAN TOGETHER TO GIVE OURSELVES- A RUNWAY FOR HOW WE ACTUALLY FILL THIS GAP AND- NOT. CREATE FALSE HOPE IN A GOOD YEAR AND THEN DASH EVERYONE'S HOPES IN IN IN THE YEAR AFTER THIS VERY VULNERABLE PEOPLE COUNTING ON US HERE SO I'LL MAKE TWO COMMENTS AND THEN MY CALLING THE ELABORATE AS WELL I THINK THE FIRST IS THAT. THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT INCLUDED A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND IT'LL BE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- FOR THESE RATE INCREASES. AND THEN THERE WERE THREE SERVICE CODES THAT WERE NOT FUNDED TO THIS BUDGET INCLUDES NEARLY ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON TOP OF THAT AND SO THAT WILL HELP US MAKE PROGRESS ON THE RATE- STUDY INCREASES THAT YOU MENTIONED WE ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR PERFORMANCE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT'S ALL. THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING RATES AS WELL AS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND GET BETTER PERFORMANCE METRICS AND OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE- BUT THE SECOND THING ON THE LONGER TERM YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THIS AND- YOU KNOW WE KNOW WE HAVE THE SUSPENSIONS IN THE BUDGET ACT LAST YEAR. AND THOSE HAVE BEEN DELAYED NOW BY EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUT WE CERTAINLY SEE THAT ON THE CALENDAR AND WE WANT TO FIND A WAY WHERE THAT STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT- SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY UPDATING OUR PROJECTIONS BOTH IN TERMS OF THE GENERAL MULTI YEAR. AND SPECIFICALLY THIS CATEGORY SPENDING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AS WELL. NOTHING FOR THE TO ADD SPECIFIC JUST TO. REITERATE THE POINT THAT THE RATES THAT HE HAS ALREADY INFORMED INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MADE THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT AS WELL AS WITH PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THE RACE THAT HE HAS INFORMED THE NEED TO. LOOK AT SYSTEM REFORM HOLISTICALLY AND THAT'S WHAT KIND OF. ENCOURAGE THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. THANK YOU FOR THE TO SKINNER FOLLOWED BY SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR PRE SHE EIGHT FIVE I KNOW ALL OF US ARE. GETTING READY FOR OUR- GOOD AND THOROUGH PROCESS OF REVIEWING THIS THROUGH OUR SUBCOMMITTEES AND THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE AND APPRECIATE THIS INITIAL OVERVIEW SO I WANT TO THANK- ARE. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE BUDGET FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MISTER VISITS WERE NOT THEN AND ALSO- MISTER PATRICK FROM OUR ILIO FOR YOUR OVERVIEWS ADDITIONALLY AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF KIND OF COMMENTS AND THEN. A FEW SPECIFICS- SO I APPRECIATE THE ALEJO'S WARNING ABOUT NEW ON GOING SPENDING AND THE ESTIMATE FOR- YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF IT. MAY BE JUST WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE BUT WHAT I THINK WOULD ALSO BE VERY HELPFUL. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THERE'S MY COLLEAGUES RELEASE FOR ME IS THAT SOME OF THE SPENDING. IS A POTENTIALLY PREDICATED ON SOME REDUCTIONS THAT WE WOULD BE CHIEF AND I KNOW THAT THOSE AREN'T ALWAYS IT'S HARD TO- IT'S MUCH EASIER TO MAKE THE BALLOT SHEET SHOWING THE EXPENDITURES VERSES THE COST REDUCTIONS O I JUST GIVE THE PRISON CLOSURE AS AN EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE OTHERS BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH IT FOR US TO SEE AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE BALANCING HEY WAIT A MINUTE MAY WE SHOULDN'T PURSUE. NEW SPENDING. IN WHAT WAYS ARE NEW INVESTMENTS POTENTIALLY GOING TO BRING DOWN OUR COSTS IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY WHEN I LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROPOSED NEW EXPENDITURES. THERE REALLY VERY RESPONSIVE TO CALIFORNIANS- YOU KNOW AT A VERY STRONG DESIRES IF WE LOOK AT POLLS IF WE LOOK AT OUR OWN EXPERIENCE IN OUR DISTRICTS WHETHER IT'S- THE- HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WHICH AGAIN IS. ACROSS THE STATE. REALLY BUT CALIFORNIANS HAVE SAID LOUD AND CLEAR WE WANT THIS FIXED WE WANT THIS ADDRESSED. AND THEN I THINK BACK WHILE ALIVE- WELL I CAN'T TURN TO A PARTICULAR POLL AT THIS MOMENT AROUND. DRUG COSTS I THINK WE COLLECTIVELY KNOWN IF WE WERE TO DO ONE TOMORROW- NOBODY LOOKS THEIR HIGH COST OF DRUGS. AND AIDING WE KNOW THAT OUR OWN ANALYSIS OF THE COSTA MEDI CAL. DUE TO THESE REALLY OUTRAGEOUS PRESCRIPTION COSTS AND WE'VE NOT GOTTEN THE TYPE OF REDUCTIONS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROMISED US WE'VE NOT GOTTEN THOSE SO I THINK IT IS VERY RESPONSIVE FOR CALIFORNIA IF WE CAN ACHIEVE IT. TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND COULD GIVE US SOME COST REDUCTIONS SO. I'VE THE INTEREST I HAVE IS BOTH IN WHAT WAYS MIGHT SOME OF THIS NEW SPENDING BRING US DOWN COSTS AND THEN ADDITIONALLY THE MAYBE THIS ISN'T FOR IMMEDIATE. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR A THIS NEWS. COULD INCREASE ONGOING GENERAL FUND THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP ON GOING GENERAL FUND AS IT IS AND I THINK IT'S ALWAYS WORTH IT TO LOOK BACK AT THERE COULD BE SOME. SOME ONGOING GENERAL FUND CLEARLY NOT IN K. TWELVE SCHOOLS NOT IN A FEW OTHER AREAS BUT THAT ARE KIND OF REDUNDANT NOW OR NOT REALLY YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS WE KNOW THAT WE NEED SOME NEW SPENDING IN SOME AREAS THAT RE REALLY. DIRE NEEDS NOW MAYBE THERE'S SOME SPENDING THAT ISN'T AND OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE THE PRESSURE TO MAKE A CUT AT THE MOMENT AS WE DID DURING THE RECESSION BUT IDENTIFYING WHICH ONES WHICH AREAS MAYBE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH JUSTIFICATION NOW SO AS WE THINK INTO THE FUTURE. THAT WAY I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL. FIVE AND FOR ALL GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHAT I THINK. THE A YOU KNOW AGAIN WE HAVE TO GET IN OUR WHOLE DISCUSSION AS A LEGISLATURE BUT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. I THINK THAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT CALIFORNIA. DIRECTING BEING SMARTER ABOUT INVESTMENTS THERE WHILE IT WON'T GIVE US BUDGET SAVINGS IN A SINGLE YEAR. COULD IN FACT GIVE US GREAT REDUCTIONS IN OUR IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SPENDING FOR EXAMPLE IF WE IF QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION HELPS US IDENTIFY KIDS SPECIAL NEED MOM FAR EARLIER. COULD GIVE US GREAT REDUCTIONS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGAIN WE KNOW THAT- MANY OF OUR FOLKS WHETHER THEY'RE IN JAIL OR PRISON. IF THEY HAD THE- FOR EXAMPLE. CAN'T READ THEY DON'T HAVE FULL LITERACY SO WHAT HOW I MEAN HOW ONE COULD IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO FUNCTION WELL IN OUR CULTURE SO IF YOU IF YOU IF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM AND I'M NOT TRYING TO POINT FINGERS AT OUR SCHOOLS BUT AGAIN IF YOU HAD A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. THAT WAS NOT ADDRESSED OR TENDED TO WHICH THEN BASICALLY YOUR MASKING AND LEAD TO YOU CANNOT- FUNCTION WITHIN OUR JOB TYPE BASED ECONOMY AND EVERYTHING IN A WAY THAT. YOU CAN PUT YOU IN SITUATIONS THAT LATER COST US A LOT. SO I THINK THAT THOSE KINDS OF NEW DEPARTMENTS AND AGAIN WE STILL HAVE TO DEBATED WORKING THROUGH MIGHT BE EXACTLY THE THING THAT THE STATE NEEDS RIGHT NOW TO BE MORE ATTUNED TO WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE BECAUSE OF CERTAIN OF OUR OTHER LATER. LATER INCREASED EXPENSES WHETHER IN SOCIAL SERVICE AREAS EDUCATION AREAS OR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERIOUS AND SIMILARLY. ARE MOVE TOWARDS THE CHANGES IN JUVENILE JUSTICE AGAIN WE WE'RE WE ARE MAKING THE- ALL THEN WHEN USE GAMBLE THOUGH I SAID IT ALREADY. BUT WE THE RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THEY ARE NOT INCORRIGIBLE AND SO THE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS TO MOVE THEM AWAY FROM A BAD DECISION THEY MAY HAVE MADE CAN REPURPOSE GREAT BENEFITS INTO THE FUTURE THAT'S WHAT THE RESEARCH IN THE DATA SHOWS AND THAT'S HOW I SEE THIS MOVEMENT INVESTMENTS IN. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM REFORMS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND SWITCHING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE BUT I THINK THAT THAT IT WOULD HELP US TO HAVE SOME ANALYSIS THAT IS MORE THAN JUST O. OKAY LOOK BETTER WATCH. BY YOUR INCREASED ONGOING EXPENDITURES SO THAT'S KIND OF MY GENERAL COMMENT THEN SOME SPECIFICS- VERY HAPPY THAT OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. HAVE GREAT INCREASE SPENDING OF COURSE WE KNOW EVEN WITH OUR YOU KNOW EVEN WITH A GOOD GENERAL FUND OUR PER PUPIL SPENDING IS STILL NOT WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED I DON'T KNOW HOW WE ADDRESS THAT WITHOUT SOME REAL STRUCTURAL CHANGES WITHIN OUR WHOLE REVENUE SYSTEM BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE INCREASES. AND I WANT TO END THE INCREASE TO SPECIAL ED. VERY IMPORTANT AND THEN ADDITIONALLY WASN'T MENTIONED IN OUR OVERVIEW BUT I NOTICED THERE'S A PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AROUND. AN INCREASE TO THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR SCHOOL MEALS. AND I THINK AGAIN THAT ONE IS- IS ONE OF THOSE WHERE YEAH IT'S INCREASE SPENDING BUT AGAIN WE KNOW THAT A LARGE PERCENT OF OUR KIDS. GET MOST OF THEIR MEALS AT SCHOOL SO THEY'RE IN THE FACT RECEIVING THEIR CALORIES AND NUTRITION AT SCHOOL SO IF WE CAN. ENSURE THAT THAT CALORIES IN THE NUTRITION IS THE HIGHEST QUALITY WE KNOW WE WILL GET BETTER HEALTH AND EDUCATION OUTCOME SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THAT- IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IN OUR- RELY ON OUR ON BUDGET I THINK SO OF ONE CHAIR TO BE GETTING INTO SOME OF THESE DETAILS BUT I NOTICED THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. AND FOR ONE I'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE WHETHER THOSE WHERE THERE THAT PROPOSAL IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IS GEOGRAPHIC SPECIFIC OR JUST ALL ACROSS THE STATE. AND I NOTED BECAUSE- WE- LAST YEAR. WE HAD WE LOTS OF JOB GROWTH AND WHAT TO JOBS. IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND THERE'S GROWTH IN HIGHER WAGE JOBS AND IF WE CAN TAILOR. AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THESE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE IF WE CAN TAILOR MORE OF OUR- JOB TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIPS TOWARDS THOSE HIGHER WAGE JOBS. THEN WE CAN ASSIST. THE FOLKS IN OUR STATE UNFORTUNATELY SO MANY THAT ARE IN THESE LOW WAGE JOBS AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SURGICAL. AND SO I'LL- IS IT'S NOT MY SEVEN COMMITTEE I WILL ASK MY- CHAIR OF THAT TO DIG DOWN INTO THAT TO HELP SOME OF US. IN A MAKING OUR DECISION AROUND IT- AND THEN IN THE CLIMATE BUDGET. AGAIN I'M NOT OPPOSED TO NEW AREAS OF SPENDING THEIR OR EVEN TO AN INCREASE IN OUR AUCTION REVENUE BUT I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE REDUCTIONS IN AB SIX SEVENTEEN FUNDING. THE REDUCTIONS IN MONIES THAT WILL HELP MOVE US OFF FOSSIL FUEL TO DIESEL AND THE REDUCTIONS- WHICH WHICH INCLUDED SOME OF THE ACT THINGS BUT ALSO THE HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY DUTY VEHICLES. ARM AND ARE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND THE REASON I RAISE IT IS BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THOSE AREAS STILL HUGE CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEMS. THEY ARE THE AREAS THAT MAKE ART HERE THE MOST UNHEALTHY AND WE STILL HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IF WE TAKE THE TEN CITIES ACROSS THE US WITH THE WORST AIR POLLUTION SEVEN OF THEM ARE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT REDUCTIONS IN THE G. G. R. F. THAT ARE THAT WILL ALSO HURT OUR OUTCOMES FROM AIR QUALITY- AND THEN LASTLY ON THE HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW MOST OF IT. IT'S NOT JUST ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS WHO ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY HOMELESS BUT ALSO IT IS KEEPING OUR CALIFORNIANS HOUSED WHO MIGHT BE ON THE BRINK BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT INVESTMENT AND I'M VERY GLAD GOVERNOR RECOGNIZED IT AND THAT THE- COMMITTEE THAT. OF MAYOR STEINBERG AND- THE LA COUNTY YES A RIDLEY THOMAS ARE TEARING HAVE ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT INVESTMENTS IN KEEPING FOLKS HOUSE IS REALLY SMART REALLY WISE. BUT I KNOW THAT MOST OF IT IN THIS BUDGET IS ONE TIME. WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN THIS YEAR THAT MAY BE AN AREA THAT NEEDS TO BE ON GOING SO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. THREE IN THE EXPECTATION ABOUT A RESPONSE- SKINNER FROM IF THEY WANT TO BUT OTHERWISE IT'S A MORE A MORE. MY OVERVIEW. ALRIGHT WE WILL TAKE ALL THAT FEEDBACK BACK TO OUR IS DEPENDING- THE COMMON AND SEEMS WHETHER IT WOULD BE OKAY IF THE LA- FELT LIKE THEY COULD DO THE KIND OF. THAT KIND OF EXERCISE. YES SENATOR SKINNER I THINK WHAT YOU ARE RAISING IS A REALLY IMPORTANT- CONCEPT. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I MAY NOT IN- YOU KNOW RETICULATED WELL ENOUGH BUT THAT WE- WE DO THINK THAT MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS HAVE MERIT. MANY OF THEM HAVE- PROBABLY AN ALIGNMENT WITH THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS EXPRESSED PREVIOUSLY AND EVEN. THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT DID CALIFORNIANS AS WE SEE IT TOO. I THINK WHAT. I WAS JUST RACINE IS THAT. THERE IS KIND OF A WIDE RANGE OF PROPOSALS MANY OF THEM I THINK WE'RE STILL AWAITING SOME OF THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND SO WE'RE JUST RAISING THE QUESTION OR THAT THE POINT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WOULD USE THEM LOOK AT THE ESTIMATES BEFORE YOU THEY DON'T TAKE ANY OF THAT INTO ACCOUNT YET. AND TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE THE DATA THAT COULD SUPPORT IT SOME OF THE TYPES OF NEAR TERM SPENDING THAT GENERATE LONG TERM SAVINGS SOME OF THOSE ARE VERY HARD TO. IT IS YOU KNOW VALIDATE- IN IN DATA BUT BUT TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT WE WILL BE HAPPY TO TRADE INCORPORATED SO. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU SO MUCH A MADAM CHAIR AND AGAIN OUR THANKS- BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. I THINK. SPREAD ECCA I THINK YOU'RE STAFF IF THEY HAVE BEEN RE TOLD YOU KNOW THAT I ASKED THIS VERY QUESTION ALL THE TIME LIKE OKAY WHAT HAPPENS IF WE MAKE THE INVESTMENT WHAT'S THE OUT YEARS WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T MAKE THE INVESTMENT THE OUT YEAR AND- I AGREE WITH YOU CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SOMEONE WHO DOES HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH BY SAID EVEN THAT'S BUT EVEN HOLDING A VERY HIGH STANDARD FOR THE QUALITY OF DATA RIGHT AND SAY- THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE SAVINGS THROUGH INVESTMENT SO WE THINK ABOUT- HOW DO WE PREPARE FOR THE NEXT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CERTAINLY AND I'VE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IN A MANY OF US. AND WE HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND SO FORTH BUT ALSO THIS IS THE TIME YOU WANT TO INVEST IN MAKING THE KIND OF CHANGES THAT THAT LEAD TO LOWER EXPENDITURES LATER ON THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF TRYING TO- PREPARE FOR DOWNTURN AS WELL- NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE SEVERAL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON VERY SPECIFIC TOPICS LIKE HOMELESS SO FORTH SO I WHY WHY FOCUS MY COMMENTS AND ACTUALLY QUESTIONS ON- HERE TODAY IS REALLY SORT OF THE OUT YEARS pBUDGET PROCESS WERE MAINLY LOOKING AT. THE PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THIS COMING YEAR BUT- YOU KNOW ALSO COVERING BEHIND THAT IS THE OUT YEARS AND SOMETIMES IT USES AN ARGUMENT FOR AGAINST A PARTICULAR BUDGET PROPOSAL SO- I THINK- AGAIN I KNOW THAT MY GOOD FRIEND- CENTER SKINNER I MENTIONED THE HOMELESSNESS I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PUTTING THAT INVESTMENT LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THE DETAILS WE'LL TALK ABOUT BUT THAT MORE HERE- FUTURE COMMITTEE HEARING BUT. THE IDEA THAT IT'S GONNA BE A ONE YEAR. I THINK IS THAT AND SAYING THAT AS PROJECT A BUDGET OUT YOU. THAT WOULD GO DO THIS IS A ONE YEAR THING IS. I'M NOT SURE THAT'S A REALLY A REALISTIC ASSUMPTION RIGHT IF WE ACTUALLY GO OUT TO COMMUTING SAID. HERE'S ONE YEAR FUNDING. AND THERE'S NO COMMITMENT TO FURTHER YEARS I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA BE EFFECTIVELY EVEN USE THE MONEY. NOT TO SAY- IS THAT TRULY REALISTIC PROJECTION ON HOW WE AND SPEND DRAPED. SO AS WE LOOK AT THAT. I KNOW THAT. IN THE PROPOSAL THERE'S OFFICIALLY EIGHTEEN MONTH. EXTENSION OF THESE AUTOMATIC SUSPENSIONS. YOU KNOW I EIGHT I JUST THINK THAT SURE WE CAN I MEAN AND WE DID VOTE FOR- ON EXPENSES LAST YEAR THAT'S SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR PUSHED FOR AND WE EXCEEDED BUT I'D REALLY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT AUTOMATIC SUSPENSION BE IF WE TRULY CARRY IT OUT. IS IT SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO BE TELLING PEOPLE THAT. YOU KNOW I MEAN LOOKS GREAT ON THE GRAPH AND WE HAVE THIS LITTLE POP UP HERE AND TWENTY THREE YOU KNOW. TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE BEING. ENTIRELY FORTHRIGHT WITH PEOPLE INCLUDING OURSELVES IF WE THINK THAT'S REALLY HOW WE WANT TO DO THINGS RIGHT. SO AND OF COURSE MOST OF OUR FOCUS ACTION HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- AGAIN SO IS THAT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO TELL PEOPLE- INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISABILITIES PEOPLE WHO NEED SOCIAL SERVICES THAT OH BY THE WAY AND- TWENTY TWENTY THREE WERE YES THINGS AREN'T GOOD WE'RE JUST GONNA AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT ANY ACTIVE ACTOR DESCRIPTIO BY THE LEGISLATURE JUST AUTOMATICALLY LET THOSE THINGS FALL OFF THAT CLIFF. AND THEN IT SO I THINK IN TERMS OF TRYING TO LOOK AT OUT YEARS. I YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA RAISE MY CONCERN ABOUT EVEN IF IT'S QUOTE N THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE A GRASS AND IT SHOWS THAT AND I GUESS LEGALLY TECHNICALLY THAT'S WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IS THAT REALLY HOW WE WANT TO LOOK AT THINGS IS THAT REALLY WHAT OUR TRUE INTENTION IS AND- MAYBE WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE. I MAYBE ON IS TO THROW BUT YOU KNOW I'M CELL ABOUT WHAT WE REALLY WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IS THAT REALLY ARE PRIORITY THAT WE WOULD JUST AUTOMATICALLY LET THESE THINGS HAPPEN. SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE AND THEN. AS WE GET AND THINK ABOUT OUT YEARS- I THINK A CENTER STERN MENTIONED YESTERDAY WE HAD A HEARING ABOUT. DD AND THE RATE STUDY AND AFTER ALWAYS SPENT THREE YEARS SAYING WELL WAIT FOR THE RIGHT SO YOU WAIT FOR THE RATE STUDY APPRECIATE THAT THE PART IN THE AGENCIES WORKING HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE APPLICATION. AND I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU KNOW I ASSN THE AGENCY SAID WHEN THEY COME BACK IN A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WILL. PRESENT A TIME LINE. BUT I ALSO ASKED FINANCE- SO. IN THE OUT YOUR PROJECTION WHAT DID YOU DECIDE TO DO AND WHAT THEY SAID IS YES AND I AGREE AND I WANNA THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO ESSENTIALLY A BILLION DOLLARS OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN GENERAL FUND- TO INCREASE. THAT PAYMENTS FOR DD SOMEONE'S CASELOAD CENTER I WILL GET TO THE DETAILS AND WE'LL LOOK AT THAT ONE DEVICE OKAY. BUT IN THE OUT YOUR PROJECTION THEY'RE PROJECTING OUT YEAR NOTHING NO INCREASE FOR THE FOR THE YEARS SO THE PATENT THIS PROPOSED. AND WE KNOW THERE OKAY IT'S A ONE POINT TWO BILLION I GUESS BECAUSE SOME OF THE MONEY WE'RE CLOSING TO SOME OF THE GAPS. IS THAT REALLY OUR INTENTION AGAIN IN THE OUT YEARS. RIGHT TO REALLY SO- AND I HOPE WE CAN REVISIT THAT SO YES WE ARE FOR MAILING ONLY FOCUSING ON NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT THOSE OUT YEARS. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT IN THE OUT YEARS LAST YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO. ADDRESS EXTREME POVERTY RATE AND GETTING FAMILIES OUT OF THAT- AND YET. SO WE HAD A PATH BUT WE DECIDED LOOKS LIKE IN THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL NOT THEM AT BEGIN THE GOVERNOR. GIVE A COST OF LIVING INCREASE BUT NOT CONTINUING THAT PATH THAT THE SAME DEGREE THAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY. PROPOSED BEFORE. SO OF COURSE THAT'S A MAYBE CONSCIOUS DECISION WILL HAVE THAT DISCUSSION IN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE BUT- AGAIN I. YOU KNOW I THINK. IS WE'RE LOOKING AT A OUT YEARS- NO WE- THINKING ABOUT SOME THE COMMITMENTS WE MADE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE ACTUALLY APPRECIATE WE HAVE THIS EARLY AT. CARE AND EDUCATION OFFICE- INDIA WILL HAVE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. BUT THAT EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION IS THERE. PROJECTION THERE FOR IN. OUT YEARS. TO SAY THAT IN ADDITION TO CREAMY OFFICE THE MORE WE ARE WE JUST YOU OFF OKAY SO I MEAN THAT'S A BE QUESTION GONNA WANNA KNOW THE IN TO ACTUALLY ACTUALLY OVER TO PUT MORE MONEY THIS YEAR TOO BUT THAT IT BUT IN ADDITION ARE YOU PUT MORE WHAT KIND OF COMMITMENTS ARE WILLING TO MAKE OUT TO THE FUTURE- ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT YOU GET OUT YOUR SO AGAIN THANK YOU GOVERNOR FOR RECOGNIZING AS WERETRYING TO COME UP THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND- YEAH WE HAD A FOUR POINT 5% INCREASE- FOR HSS- BUT WE ACTUALLY HAD INFORMATIONAL HEARING. LAST YEAR TALK ABOUT WELL WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF AGING SO I DON'T KNOW IN YOUR OUT YOUR PROJECTIONS EXACTLY WHAT RATE OF INCREASE ARE YOU PLANNING YEAR BY YEAR ON ICE SS AND OTHER LONG TERM SUPPORT SERVICES- FOR SENIORS OKAY IS THAT GOING TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE WHAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS- AND SO FORTH SO AS AGAIN THAT'S THE OUT YOUR PART THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE WE'RE BUILDING IN INTO OUR OUR- OUR BUDGET. THEN OF COURSE OTHER RISKS E TALKED MC TAX WE ARE GONNA HAVE AN OVERSIGHT HEARING. LOOKING AT- WELL NOW IT'S YOU SEE CAL AIM NOW IT'S- WITH A HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA'S FOR ALL. AND APPRECIATE THAT'S A MAJOR INITIATIVE- EFFORT BY THE GOVERNOR AND THAT- GENERALLY SUPPORT OF THERE STILL SOME DETAILS YOU WANT TO KNOW. AND WE NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IN THE WAIVERS ARE COMING UP AND WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT RIGHT NOW. FEDERAL YELL CENTERS FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID SERVICES IS PROPOSING A SET OF REGULATIONS. THAT COULD COSTS CALIFORNIA. BILLIONS MAYBE EVEN TENS OF BILLIONS. OF MAYBE EVEN THAT SIZE- SO. AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER RISK AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE THAT ASIDE FROM THE ALSO PUSHING BACK ON THAT. SO JUST ONE OF YOU KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO BE PART DISCUSSION AGAIN THINKING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF RISK WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH- THEN FOR. FIVE SELL AND FIND I GUESS ONE OF SECOND WHAT- MY GOOD FRIEND THAT CENTER SKINNER MENTIONED ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE NINE OF US ARE LIKE HOUSE KEY- YEAH WE HAVE- FUNDS FOR ACTUALLY INTERESTING ENOUGH WE TALK A AIR POLLUTION- WHAT'S THE RESULT- IF CUTTING BACK MONEY FOR AIR POLLUTION BECAUSE WE HAVE LESS MY AGE YEAR ACCESS MY GUESS IS THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF KIDS ON THAT ACCOUNT HE MORE ASTHMA TREATMENTS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SO YOU KNOW THIS IS BLOOM TO GET SQUISHED HERE GETS OVER HERE SO. I'M HOPING WE CAN THINK ABOUT SOME REFORMS TO HOW WE'RE HANDLING OR JEER AT FAST AND SO FORTH IN A WAY THAT- BOTH GETS US OR CARBON GOALS I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN PURPOSE AND THAT SHOULD BE THE MAIN PURPOSE BUT MY GUESS IS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT CURVE WOULD PROBABLY MIGHT BRING IN LEX OR REVENUE TO SO WE CAN SUSTAIN OUR INVESTMENTS AND- THEIR POLLUTION AND THEN FINALLY- WE TALKED ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF RISKS THE ALLOWED TO DEAL WITH WILDFIRES- SO IMAGINE FLOODS SACRAMENTO IS WHAT ABOUT FLOODS- AND THEN I HAVE TO SAY IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSON IS THAT WE HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS RIGHT SO ACTUALLY EVEN TYPE THAT HOMELESSNESS AND I'D BE CURIOUS- WE CAN. GET INTO MORE DETAILS. IN A- FUTURE HEARING. SO YOU KNOW WE HAD TO HAVE THE- A. L. BECAUSE OF HOMELESS RIGHT WE HAD. IN IN. BUT SAN. RIGHT SO. WHAT INVEST ARE WE MAKING ON THE POP. HEALTH SO IN PREPARATION FOR THESE TYPES BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE. IN THE END RIGHT SAN DIEGO SPENT A LOT OF MONEY TRYING TO. DEAL WITH HEPATITIS A- AND THEN. YOU KNOW WE- READ THE NEWS AND THERE'S THIS. PANDEMIC THIS NEW MYSTERY VIRUS FROM CHINA THAT. SHOWING UP RATE AND DEAL WE HAD A BULLET SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SO. THE OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS FOR BOTH OUTBREAKS IN OUR ONGOING ISSUES LIKE ARE. VERY HIGH STD RATES AND SO FORTH SO. AD SO WANT TO DELVE INTO THAT BY JUST WHAT THE MARKER ON THAT AS WELL- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE- ISSUES- BUT MAYBE PERHAPS YOU CAN JUST COMMENT. BRIEFLY I. POINT OUT ISSUES THAT MAYBE CAN CALM ABOUT HOW FINANCE AND ALSO ELLIE AS PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WE'RE FIGURING OUT. EXACTLY WATER OUT YEARS LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE CERTAINLY WE ALL TOGETHER. MUTUALLY WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE MAKE INVESTMENTS WE CAN SUSTAIN THEM THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE THAT USUALLY REQUIRES MORE THAN. A SINGLE YEAR DEPENDING. ARE HAVING A FUND THAT WE CAN AND THEN OF COURSE BE SURE THAT WE ARE. YOU KNOW WE CAN. MITIGATE THE RISKS THAT MIGHT BE BEFORE US. YES HE- SAW ALL MAKE THREE BRIEF POINTS AND ARE YOU COVERED A LOT OF GROUND SO HI. THIS IT COVER THREE POINTS IN THAT I KNOW AND THAT YOU TO COMMITTEE HEARINGS CAN DELVE INTO ALL THESE ISSUES AND- WE HAD TO DEPART FINANCES ALSO FOLLOW UP ON ANY OF THE QUESTIONS. I THINK FIRST- MOST IMPORTANT ON THE SUSPENSIONS- CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ABSORB THERE'LL BE PAINFUL FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE. AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO AND SO. YOU KNOW WE WERE PLEASED THAT WITH THE PROJECTIONS COMING IN THIS YEAR WE CAN DELAY THEM BY EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT THE REASON THAT. WE PROPOSED BUILDING THAT MAN AND THEY WERE BUILT INTO THE ENACTED BUDGET- IS SIMPLY BECAUSE- AND WE- THIS CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR YEAR OVER YEAR. PROJECTIONS THE RATE OF GROWTH. AND REVENUES IS LOWER EACH YEAR THAN PRECEDING. SO INTO ONE TO TWO THEN THE BUDGET YEAR. LOWER TWENTY TWO TO THREE THAT'S TWO AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND LOWER THE YAR AFTER THAT. AND SO. I THINK THE FOR POINT IS THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO MAY. AT THE SUSPENSIONS YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO COMMUTER PUSHING THEM OUT OR IS. THE PICTURE CHANGES OR THE REVENUE SYSTEM CHANGES IN SOME WAY AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. THAT WE COULD DO AWAY WITH THAT MANY OF CONTINUE THOSE PROGRAMS ON THE PATH BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO DO AS WELL. IT'S SIMPLY PLACING A MARKER- SHOULD OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW COME TRUE. THEN WE ARE GOING TO BE IN A LITTLE BIT OF A CRUNCH AND THEN OF COURSE AT THAT TIME. THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN WORK THROUGH YOU KNOW WHICH OF THOSE PROGRAMS SUSPEND MAYBE THEIR PROGRAMS IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THIS ASSEMBLY OUR CURRENT. SPENDING PLAN THAT WE'RE BUILDING INTO A MULTI YEAR. BUDGET AND THAT LEADS TO THE SECOND POINT WHICH IS THAT I THINK YOU KNOW EVEN THIS MAY BUT CERTAINLY. IN THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE RIGHT THAT'S- MORE THAN THREE YEARS AWAY. WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL CLARITY BOTH IN TERMS OF OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. BUT ALSO TO THE POINT YOU RAISED ABOUT ANY FEDERAL CHANGES WITH MEDICAID- FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY ROLE. THERE'S OF COURSE ELECTION COMING UP THIS FALL AND THERE MIGHT BE CHANGES IN THE CONGRESS AND OR THE WHITE HOUSE. AND SHOULD GIVE US SOME ADDITIONAL CLARITY IN TERMS OF WHAT TYPES OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS. WE WOULD BE EXPECTING AND THAT'S MAINLY ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE. BUT ALSO ON THINGS WITH A YOU KNOW FEDERAL WILD FIRES AND WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE SO FAR THAT THE ASK. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS- RESPONDED TO OUR REQUESTS- BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON BECAUSE THE RAPPER THAT MONEY COMING IT IS FUNGIBLE. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY THAT WE HAVE. A AND THEN THE FINAL POINT ALL NAY GOD JUST ON THREE OF THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT YOU MENTIONED I KNOW THERE WILL BE TIME TO GO INTO. SOME OF THE OTHERS- BUT FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE YOU MENTIONED EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS CERTAINLY IT'S THAT. GOVERNOR'S HOPE THAT WE CAN INVEST MORE IN THERE THAT'S PART THE REASON YOU WANT TO PUT TOGETHER THIS OVERALL MASTER PLAN AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT MASTER PLAN. SHOULD BE BEING RELEASED IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. IF I RECALL CORRECTLY AND SHOULD INCLUDE IN ADDITION TO ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS. SOME. SENSE OF HOW. AVENUES WILL BE GENERATED INVEST SOME EASIER. THAT DOESN'T MEAN. THAT THEY- BE. OR BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE'RE H THERE THAT WE GET IS. OF HOW CAN WE ASK. PUT IN. MONEY BEYOND THE IN. TO WE'VE CURRENT. MADE WHEN IT COMES TO H. THAT IS MORE OF A CASELOAD ENTITLEMENT ISSUES SO THAT. MAKE GROWING THE NATURAL OF COURSE OF THE ECONOMY TURNS AS YOU KNOW. THINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT BUT- THAT GROWTH THAT WE CONTINUE TO BUILDINGS ARE MULTI YEAR PROJECTION- AND THEN FINALLY ON HOMELESSNESS- VERY COGNIZANT OF YOUR POINT THAT THIS CAN'T BE SOLVED. IN ONE YEAR AND SO ONE YEAR OF FINDING. IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.I THINK OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR BUDGET- WHAT THE GOVERNOR WORKING WITH LEGISLATURE'S. IS OUT ON HIS TOWARD THIS YEAR AND THEN THE RECOMMENDATIONS AB MAYOR STEINBERG AND- SUPERVISOR RIDLEY THOMAS. IS THAT THERE IS A LOT FLOWING IN THE SPACE- IN TERMS OF NEW PROPOSAL SOME OF WHICH WE PROPOSED ON OUR OWN. SO I THINK IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE GONNA TRY TO COME TOGETHER ON A STRATEGY FOR. HOW TO ATTACK THIS BOTH IN THE BUDGET BUT ALSO TAKING OVER THE LONG TERM. A YES SO. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN I THINK YOU YOU MADE A LOT OF- GOOD OBSERVATIONS- FOR US- BUT- AS FOR THE L. YEAR. I THINK IT IS PRUDENT TO PLAN FOR AN OPERATING SURPLUS PARTICULARLY IN A TIME WHEN REVENUE GROWTH IS SLOWING. AND WE THINK THAT THERE COULD BE SOME RISKS TO THE- TO THE OUTLOOK AND CERTAINLY THE- GOVERNOR'S PLAN DOES SHOW THAT THERE WOULD BE- AN OPERATING SURPLUS. ON PAPER. BUT YOU KNOW AS YOU POINTED OUT THAT IF THE SUSPENSIONS- DID NOT TAKE EFFECT. THEN THE LARGER SURPLUS IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE. LIKE A TWO BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. AND SO. ARE WE JUST THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE. BETTER IF THE LEGISLATURE CARES ABOUT THE COMMITMENTS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE SUSPENSION PROGRAMS THAT. TO RECOGNIZE THE FULL COST OF THEM UP FRONT AND THEN DECIDE ON THE MERITS OF THOSE OF THOSE COMMITMENTS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT WANTS TO FUND THOSE ARE OTHER PRIORITIES- KIND OF FROM A CLEAR I PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHAT IT IMPLIES FOR THIS THE STATE'S OUT YOUR PHYSICAL CONDITION. YEAH THANK YOU AND I JUST MAKE ONE LAST MARK- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THINGS WE ALSO TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT RECOGNIZING WE A WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH OUR ECONOMIC AND OTHERS UNCERTAINTIES OTHER RISKS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES THAT WERE USING BASICALLY YEARS PUSHING THAT UNCERTAINTY ON TO ALL THE PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH THE STATE ALRIGHT PEOPLE RECEIVE SERVICES PEOPLE DELIVERING THE SERVICES. SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT GOING OUT THERE SUSPENSION IT'S GONNA HAPPEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND WE HAVE A SON CUT WHAT DO I DO RIGHT HOMELESSNESS MONEY WILL AND AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR RIGHT SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF HOW THAT THAT AFFECTS HOW OTHER PEOPLE MAKES DECISIONS AND- SOMETIMES. BECAUSE SITUATION WHERE. WE MAY BE LESS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE PEOPLE MAKE CERTAIN DECISIONS. BASED ON- BASICALLY TOLD THEM. AND THAT MAY NOT BE WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IN TERMS OF HOW THE END UP BEHAVING SO I JUST WANNA SAY THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OUT COLLEAGUES WE HAVE TO ADDITIONAL MEMBERS IN Q. AND I JUST WANNA REMIND US ALL THAT THIS FIRST OVERSIGHT HEARING IS REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR US TO ENGAGE FINANCE AND A AND THE LA SHOW. IN THE OVER ARCHING ARCHITECTURE OF THE BUDGET ALL OF YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OPPORTUNITY. IN YOUR NUMEROUS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS IN MARCH TO DELVE DEEPLY INTO THE SPECIFICS OF TH BUDGET PROPOSALS BUT I DON'T WANT US TO LOSE SIGHT OF. THIS IS THE ONE OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE GET TO HAVE THE TEN THOUSAND FOOT. ARCHITECTURE CONVERSATION FORGOT TO ADDITIONAL PEOPLE ON CUE. YOU KNOW I AS CHAIR TEND TO GO LAST TO. AFFORD MY COLLEAGUES AN OPPORTUNITY BUT I'M GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION AROUND REVENUE AND- A RECESSION MITIGATION AND SPENDING PROPOSALS I KNOW WE'RE LOSING PEOPLE. BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT I AM GOING TO BRING US BACK THERE. SOMEONE ASKED MY LAST TWO MEMBERS TO THINK ABOUT THE CON THE POINT OF TODAY'S HEARING- AND USE THIS OPPORTUNITY ACCORDINGLY. WITH THAT WE HAVE MISTER BAIL FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MCGUIRE INCIDENT TO NIELSEN HOUSE. AND ADDITIONAL ENQUIRING SENATOR BAIL. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERS AS CHAIR. AND THE FACT. THIS IS THE ERROR THAT- IS A LOT DIFERENT THAN BUDGET WE HAD- WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND MY FIRST YEARS IN THE SENATE WHERE WE WERE CUTTING THIRTY FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF THE BUDGET WE- REMOVE THE BUDGETS NOW WE HAVE A BUDGET THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF. SURPLUS WERE- PROCEEDING AHEAD WITH A NEW GOVERNOR AND WITH NEW IDEAS- CHANGES THAT HE WANTS TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN GOALS ERIC AND I THINK IN TERMS OF OUR OVER ARCHING ISSUE FOR ME IS. SOMETIMES JUST A ADVICE SOMETIMES IS A LITTLE EASIER TO LOOK- THINGS LIKE ARE THESE PROGRAMS WORKING WELL ARE THEY PERFORMING WORKING WELL. DO YOU FUNDAMENTALLY HAVE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE. OR AS EFFICIENT AS A SHOULD. AND MAYBE IT'S TIME TO SHARPEN THE PENCIL NOW ON SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS RATHER THAN TRY TO DEAL WITH THOSE KINDS OF PROBLEMS WHEN THE BUDGET CRISIS IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE ALL THE CUTS SO LITTLE EASIER TO. COME UP WITH SOME EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS. IN THIS SITUATION. SO I AGREE WITH CENTER SKINNER SHE MAKES REMARKS ABOUT OUR COMMITTEE AND I'M CERTAIN- OTHER COMMITTEES- WILL BE DOING THE SAME THING BUT- OF WHEN WE WHEN WE WROTE SP ONE. WE PUT IN THERE THAT- CALTRANS SAID TO HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF EFFICIENCY IN A REPORT EVERY YEAR OR SO IT'S KILLER BUT NOW THEY'RE UP TO. TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FISH AND SEES THAT WE FORCED ON THEM THROUGH A STATUTE THAT WE PUT IN A STATUTE THAT WE'VE FORCED ON THEM. AND THEY HAVE. COME UP WITH THAT. NOW OVER OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD THE LEVEL OF MONEY WE'RE GOING TO SAVE IS IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WE'LL HAVE THAT MONEY REINVESTED IN PROJECTS. OF THAT WE CAN BUT WHAT WE WANT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO FUN. SO I THINK. THE A MINOR NIT YOU KNOW I WANT TO ADMONISH YOU TO. DON'T JUST FOCUS ON THE BUDGET CHANGES THEIR PROPOSED BUT FOCUS ON THE EXISTING BUDGET TO TRY TO FIND WAYS THAT WE CAN DO. THINGS BETTER MAKE EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS OF BRING UP WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN MY COMMITTEE WITH WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN SP ONE MADAM MADAM SURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN SP ONE OVERSIGHT HEARING JUST TO GET AN UPDATE ABOUT ALL WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS BE ONE. AND HOW WE'RE TRYNG TO BE EFFICIENT WITH THE USE OF THE FUNDS- THE DMV- IT HAS- I NOTICE- THEY DIDN'T REALLY ASK FOR ANY MONEY CORRECT. SO I THINK- YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE CHANGING THE DAY OF THE TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT THAT WAS BUILT ON NECESSITY FOR DIEM WORRIED ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM- THEIR FUNCTION BY THE TIME THE REAL ID DEADLINE OMES IN OCTOBER. OF THIS NEXT YEAR SO THAT'S GOING TO BE. A ISSUE I THINK ON A IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO ONE BILLION ONE POINT FOUR BILLION ONGOING PROGRAMS. I LOOK AT LOOKING AT THE SUFFICIENCY THING AS AN EASY WAY TO CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN THE TWO. OKAY SO MAYBE IF YOU WORK TOGETHER AND FOUND SOME AFFECTION SEES HERE AND THERE THAT WE COULD. THE CHIEF OF THAT WILL CLOSE THE GAP OF HOUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOUSING BECAUSE I'M I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE FACT THAT THIS BUDGET REPRESENTS- JUST A ONE TIME MAINLY IN ALMOST ALL THE MONEY IS ONE TIME NOT ON GOING BUT WE HAVE A COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE TO DO AN UNDERSTANDING I THINK WE WERE ETTING FROM YOU IN THE IN THE READING THE BUDGET. THAT WE HAVE TO DO AN ONGOING- HOUSING PROGRAM TO THE GEE WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE AND HOUSING. AND I WOULD URGE YOU TO LOOK AT AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FINDING. A SUCH AS WE PROPOSED LAST YEAR IN THE SENATE. AND THE GOVERNOR VETOED WITH SAM ACQUIRE ANTHONY PORTANTINO ME. PROPOSING A BILL THAT ACTUALLY WORKED IN A COLLABORATION WITH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. YOU'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE A COLLABORATION WITH ALL THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THERE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HANDLE. THE TYPES OF PEOPLE THERE HOMELESS THE- WELL THAT IS- ALMOST BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC REASONS. BECAUSE OF THE RATE GOING UP TOO MUCH OF THE SOCIAL REASONS THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND- OTHER TRAUMA. AND AS RESULTS- HAD TO RUN AWAY FROM THAT KIND OF SITUATION. AND THEY BECAME HOMELESS SEVEN THERE'S- THERE'S DIFFERENT REASONS- THERE'S- PEOPLE THAT ARE DISABLED THERE ARE- I THINK WE'RE WE'RE VERY SCARED THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DISABLED ARE LOSING THEIR GROUP HOMES THEY'RE CLOSING GROUP PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT'S CAUSING SOME HOMELESSNESS. THAT'S KIND OF SCARY THAT SOMEBODY IT CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF WE NEED TO HAVE THAT SAFETY NET FOR THOSE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE LOSING OF WE'RE WE'RE LOSING GROUP HOMES THAT THEY ARE CARED FOR IN. AND THIS INCLUDES PEOPLE- THAT HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. SO I TAKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOUSING. OF IT SEEMS TO ME THAT- THIS KIND OF SAFETY NET WITH THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE IS VERY IMPORTANT I I'M I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. I THINK YOU SHOULD SET GOALS AND NUMBERS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU WANNA HOUSE AND WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE EACH YEAR TO ELIMINATE HOMELESSNESS. AND REALLY GET DOWN TO REFINING THAT AND pCOMING UP WITH THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS. I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOMELESS BECAUSE- ONE MY FAMILY WE HAD A FIRE OUR HOUSE BURNED DOWN AND THE TWELVE OF US BECAME HOMELESS SO I HAD EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW IT IT AND THAT'S A TEPER THAT WAS A TEMPORARY A YEAR AND A HALF WE IN A PLACE TO LIVE WE KIND OF CANCER THE FAMILY ALL OVER THE PLACE- BUT IT DISRUPTED THE FAMILY AND WE FINALLY KIND OF. BECAUSE OF THE HARD WORK OF MY FATHER AND MOTHER. WE TOOK CARE THAT AND WE BOUNCE BACK BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE A LONGER TIME IT'S HARDER- THEY HAVE VARIOUS BARRIERS. THERE THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS THE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS IT'S NOT JUST ONE ANSWER IS THAT THE HOMELESS IS NOT JUST PEOPLE THAT HAVE MENTALLY ILL AND DRUG ABUSE. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE THERE HOMELESS SAY THE- IF YOU GO TO THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY COUNT THE HOMELESS YOU'LL FIND OUT. I THINK WE UNDERESTIMATE FOR EXAMPLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE PEOPLE IN THE SHELTERS. WE WORK ON MENTAL HEALTH I WANT TO. I I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED I DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THE QT BECAUSE I THINK WE LEARNED THROUGH A LOT OF STUDIES ON MENTAL HEALTH THAT WE HAVE TO. FOCUS ON. EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION WHERE AND- THERE UNDER EIGHTEEN- YOUNG KIDS EVEN THE PRE K. THE TRUMP YOU KNOW THE TRUMP DRAMATIC EXPERTS IS THAT KIDS GO THROUGH WHEN THEY'RE TO AFFECT THE NOT THEIR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS I THINK THE SURGEON GENERAL'S CORRECT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT. I THINK THE EARLY- ALL THESE PROGRAMS THAT THE CHAIR IN THE CENTER PAN AND OTHERS HAVE ADVOCATED FOR. A CHILD CARE- THAT'S THAT'S ACTUALLY PREVENTING A CUTIE AND THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE. IF YOU WANT TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT YOU'LL HAVE LESS SPECIAL ED KIDS OF YOU TAKE CARE OF THEM. EARLY AT THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. BUT WE'LL WE'LL TO PICK UP EARLIER THE FAMILIES SO NEEDS IN TERMS OF A KID DO WITH DISABILITIES- THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES AND SOME FAMILIES DON'T GET DISCERN UNTIL IT SO. LIKE FOR PHYSICS GREATER EVEN LATER NOT AND THAT'S THAT'S WRONG THAT'S THAT'S THE DISPARITY RACIAL ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL IT MIGHT MY- A MENTOR MY MOTHER MY MOTHER. AND I STILL HAVE IT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT I THINK I SHOWED YOU THIS MY MOTHER DID UP. I ASKED HER I SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO DO WITH EDUCATION SHE SAID. TRAINED AS TEACHERS AND GIVE THEM EXTRA AFTER TAKING CARE OF. KIDS AND- KIDS IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE HARDER. TO TEACH AND- HELP THE SPECIAL ED TEACHERS. WITH BENEFITS IN TRAINING. AND THE GOVERNOR I SHOW THE GOVERNOR. ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR MY MOTHER'S. VIDEOTAPE I GUESS YOU LISTEN TO MAMA. AND HE PUT SOME MONEY IN THE BUDGET SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S LISTEN TO MY MAMA SHE'S NINETY THREE YEARS OLD RIGHT AND SHE STOPPED TO CHEN WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHTY SIX. SO SHE TALKED TO SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHTY SIX SO I APPRECIATE. DEALING WITH THE SPECIAL ED. PROGRAM IN AND MORE OF A STRATEGIC VIEW I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY FOR MAYOR OF COURSE- A DAD OF SOMEBODY THAT WENT THROUGH THE SPECIAL ED SYSTEM. WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SO. THE LAST THING I WANT TO RAISE MIDDLEMAN CHURN I THINK. YOU'VE HEARD FROM ME BEFORE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA YOU'RE NOT GONNA. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND HOMELESS AND LESS YOU UNDERSTAND SSI. THERE'S ALL THERE'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ON SSI. GIVING THEM A HAIR CUT IN TERMS OF. THE INCREASED S. ASIDE IS NOT A GOOD IDEA IF YOU WANT TO SOLVE YOUR HOMELESS PROBLEM. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT FALL INTO PRO HOMELESS ACTUALLY ARE PEOPLE. THAT EITHER ELIGIBLE. FOR MORE ON SSI AND ARE LOSING THEIR GROUP HOMES THEY'RE LOSING THEIR HOUSING THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE HOUSING VOUCHER- THEY MAY BE DISABLED AND NOT GETTING PROPER CARE. OF THEY MAY BE AN ELDERLY PERSON THAT BECAME HOMELESS WE'RE STARTING TO SEE MORE ELDERLY. THAT ARE HOMELESS. IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE I SEE IN MY COMMUNITY WHICH- SAN JOSE IS THE ABOUT THE SECOND I THINK WE'RE THE NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF HOMELESS. THE SAN JOSE COMMUNITY IS A NUMBER TO SECRETARY. IN TERMS OF THE COUNTS. OF SO THERE'S A LOT OF ELDERLY THAT HAVE BECOME HOMELESS. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT SSI BENEFITS SHOULD BE INCREASED AND I THINK THAT THIRTEEN DOLLARS. IS PARSIMONIOUS AND SHOULD BE LOOKED OUT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AMOUNT. AND NOT BE A HINDRANCE IN SOLVING THE HOMELESS PROBLEM. IS I THINK PEOPLE NEED THE INCOME TO. PAY FOR THE NEXT WEEK'S RANT THAT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE AND I THINK THIRTEEN DOLLARS. I DON'T THINK IT I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH I THINK IT SHOULD BE INCREASED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE MY INSURER- THE THOUGHTS I'M ALWAYS GOING TO SPEAK UP OF THE SAFETY NET. SO MY LAST BUDGET. I HAVE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT FOR EVERYBODY THAT THE DAY CARES ABOUT THIS AND- I THINK GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS ON HIS WAY TO SOME GOOD IDEAS HE JUST HAS TO. FINALIZES STRATEGIES. AND COME UP WITH SOME ONGOING WAYS OF FINDING OUT I THINK THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE FOR HIM. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE THANK YOU SIR- SENATOR REQUIRE YOUR LAST UP. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WILL BE BRIEF IN THREE QUICK POINTS ON THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN WHICH- THE GOOD CENTER FROM SAN JOSE DANCE AT SOME SOLUTIONS I THINK THAT IS VERY MUCH A VALUABLE TOOL. THAT HE'S BEEN FOCUSING ON AND WOULD HOPE THAT IS GONNA GET SOME CONSIDERATION. UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE POINT OF VIEW- IN POTENTIAL AVENUE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE BUT I THINK- THE SINNERS HARD WORK- SHOULD BE EVALUATED SERIOUSLY. TAKE A LOOK AT A GLOBAL VIEW PRETTY CHAIR ON TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN DECISION BE EIGHT CODE. I'D ALL THOSE WHO ARE FOR AND OF WAS NOT IN THE ROLE THAT YOU WERE AT THIS POINT. BUT THAT IS- TAKING EXCESS PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATION THAT WAS DEDICATED TO SCHOOLS AND THEN TAKING IT- AND FINDING A TRIAL COURT'S. SO I THINK LAST YEAR IT WAS APPROXIMATELY NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN EXCESS PROPERTY TAX- ALLOCATIONS EXCESS EDUCATION FUNDING. WHICH IS FUNDING TRIAL COURTS NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK IN A TRAILER BILL IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ADVANCE THAT. SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR I THINK THAT IT NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT MOVING THE BALL FORWARD ON EIGHTY EIGHT- IN IMPACTS CITIES. EXCUSE ME IMPACTS COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA AS WELL SEVEN CALIFORNIA- AT APPROXIMATELY NINETY MILLION A KNOW THAT. AT SOME CHALLENGES IN LAST ITEM ALL SAY. BEN CHAIR IN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CENTER NIELSEN HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON OF SEE SENATOR STERN AND MANY WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY. WHILE AND FIRES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ADVANCED LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT APPLICATIONS- IS TO BE FOCUSED ON THE 200-017-2000 EIGHTEEN WHILE THEN FIRES- IT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW TREASURER Mà IS LOOKING AT. AND LOOKING AT THE INTERPRETATION ABOUT HOW THESE TAX CREDITS ARE GOING TO BE SPENT. THE INTERPRETATION AT LEAST BY THOSE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEY'VE ALSO SUBMITTED A LETTER ON THIS- THAT TO SECURE THE TAX CREDITS. IT WOULD BE FOCUS ON THE COUNTIES THAT WERE IMPACTED IN WHILE AND FIRES. ON THE STATE HAS AT LEAST UP UNTIL THIS POINT TAKING A MUCH BROADER VIEW. IN FOCUSING UP POTENTIALLY THERE'S BEEN NO FINAL DECISION. ON USING X. TAX CREDITS ON HOUSING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE COUNTIES THAT WERE INTENDED WERE BUTTE LAKE MENDOCINO NAPA NEVADA OR IN CINEMA YUBA LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO SANTA BARBARA PRINTER AND SHASTA ALL THE IN BEEN IMPACTED BY WILD EMPIRES ALL OF SEEN SIGNIFICANT HOUSING STOCK LOST THAT IS SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO GET A FOLLOW UP WITH APARTMENT A FINANCES IN THE WORLD TO WORKING WITH- TREASURE MáS OFFICE. AS WELL- AT A FURTHER DATE AND THAT IS ALL FOR ME AND IF IT'S ALRIGHT TO THE CHARITIES HEARING TO RESPONSES FROM BOTH THE LEFT. AND BACK THANK YOU. UPLOAD GO AHEAD. HELLO WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT FINALLY SHE IN PARTICULAR. ANY COMMENT ON OR HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO HAVE A OFTEN CONVERSATION ON AND THE EXCESS EDUCATION HAVE. ON THIS ISSUE YES A MEMBER OF THE ISSUE YOUR CURRENT BUDGET IS- CONSISTENT WITH THE EXISTING EDUCATION CODE SO WE HAVEN'T PROPOSED ANY CHANGES SO IT'S NOT IN OUR JANUARY BUDGET- BUT HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL AWARE OF ALL THE DETAILS. YEAH I THINK THE ISSUE IS THE- THE POTENTIAL LEGALITY OF THAT- AND PROP NINETY EIGHT. YES TO OUR CURRENT VIEW IS THAT- THE WAY THAT IT'S ALLOCATED CURRENTLY IS A IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING LAW- SO THAT CERTAINLY THAT ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW- BUT WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE IN TERMS OF TALKING FOR SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH. ELIA INTO FLORA JUST LEAVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE TOO CAN ALL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU SENATOR WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK IN THE SYRIAN AND PLAYED TO ADVISE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU TO BOTH LA- IS WILL THE PRIME IN FINANCE THANK YOU SO MUCH VENTURE THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN YOUR FOLLOW UP. TWO OBSERVATIONS NO QUESTION WE WANT TO DEFER TO THE CHAIR. FOR HER LAST THE INCREASE THE DD ISSUE AND THE RATE SO I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THAT YOU SEE UP VERY HIGH PRIORITY TO SEVERAL OF US HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THAT ADDRESSED. IN THE BUDGET. AND THEN I WANT TO PUT ON YOUR RADAR SCREEN FISCALE. I THINK WE'RE HEADED TOWARDS ANOTHER DISASTER. DISASTERS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A- CREDIBLE EXPENSIVE AND LONG OVERDUE BUT OVER TIME. TECH THE- IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST KEEP NOT GETTING IN RIGHT. SO I'M GOING TO BE REALLY THAT THE INQUISITIVE AND ALL OVER THAT FISH SCALE PROGRESS THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE GENTLEMAN I HAVE FOR. QUESTIONS ONE ON REVENUE SECOND RESET RECESSION MITIGATION THIRD SPENDING PROPOSALS AND FOR- QUESTION ON THE- BSA THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT FIRST OF ALL THE- BUDGET REVENUES ARE UP APPROXIMATELY FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION FROM THE ADOPTED NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET AND FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE POINT ONE BILLION IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF ABOUT FIVE BILLION FROM THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ACT. I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOU THINK THE PRIMARY DRIVING FACTORS ARE ON THAT ARE DRIVING THE REVENUE GROWTH AT IF YOU ASSUME A SIMILAR LEVEL OF GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE FORECASTED PERIOD. SURE I'LL MAKE TWO BRIEF POINTS I THINK THE FIRST IS THAT- BOTH LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR WE HAVE SEEN SEVEN ECONOMIC AND IN PARTICULAR CAPITAL GAINS GROWS ABOUT EXPECTATIONS SO- WHEN THE GOVERNOR WAS COMING INTO OFFICE IN DECEMBER OR JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN. WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE STOCK MARKET- BUT NOW THAT WE'RE IN TWENTY TWENTY WE CAN LOOK BACK AND LOOK AT THE TWENTY NINETEEN YEAR AND WE SAW A PRETTY HISTORIC YEAR FOR STOCK MARKET GROWTH YOU KNOW WELL ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER- SO WE'RE PROJECTING GENERALLY BOTH IN CAPITAL GAINS SPECIFICALLY BUT ALSO ECONOMIC GROWTH GENERALLY- THE ECONOMY CONTINUING TO GROW FOR TIME AND THAT'S WHY REVENUES ARE GOING UP. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE PROJECTING SLOWING GROWTH IN EACH OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH YOU DO SEE EXPENDITURE GROWTH IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS- IT'S A SLOWING RATE OF GROWTH AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES. YOU MENTIONED ASK FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN LAST YEAR AND PROJECT FOR THIS YEAR BUT FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WERE PROJECTING ONLY ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS- FOR THE YEAR OF GROWTH FOR THE YEAR AFTER THAT EXPENDITURE. GROWTH I'M SORRY MILLION WRONG WHY BUT ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN THE YEAR AFTER THAT WE'RE PROJECTING UNDER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT WE'RE PROJECTING IN THE RANGE OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS CC IN EACH YEAR ALONGSIDE A PROJECTION OF. SWUNG REVENUES WE ARE PROTECTING OUR MULTI YEAR SONG EXPENDITURES AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER AND YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE NUMBERS. YES WE WOULD OF COURSE A LOT OF THE REVENUES TO BE WE ARE HOPING THEIR AVENUES WILL BE HIGHER BUT THAT CERTAINLY THE WAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. RIGHT NOW AND THEN MYCOLOGY CHAMBERLAIN WHO LEADS ARE REVENUE UNIT. MAY WANT TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT. I'M ACTUALLY I THINK OKAY. YOU COVER ALL COME TO THE LA WE OFTEN OF TRIED YOU BOTH TO THIS OVERSIGHT HERE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHO'S PROJECTIONS ARE HIGHER WHOSE LOWER WHO WAS CLOSER TO REALITY THE YEAR BEFORE. AND SO I DON'T REMEMBER- MY NINE YEARS NOW IN THE LEGISLATURE A TIME WHEN- FINANCE AND ELLIE OWES PROJECTIONS WERE SO CLOSE- IS THAT TELL ME WHY YOU THINK THAT IS THERE ARE YOU ENGAGE IN A NEW. METHOD OF MODELING OR- WELL EVERYBODY SHARING THE SAME CRYSTAL BALL NOW HOW DO WE GET THERE- WILL LET ME START WITH A HIGH LEVEL COM IN THE MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN CAN- WAY IN. WE HAVE VERY SIMILAR REVENUES FOR THE THREE YEARS THAT MAKE UP THE BUDGET WINDOW AS I MENTIONED IN THE OPENING. SO THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT THOUGH IS THAT THE COMPONENTS OF OUR REVENUE GROWTH ARE ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WE HAVE. MORE OF OUR REVENUES IN THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND I THINK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES. SEEN SOME MORE REVENUE IN THE CORPORATION TAX AND THEN. I THINK ONE IMPLICATION OF THAT IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK TO THE OUT YEAR WITH OUR PERSONAL INCOME TAX- HIM DRIVING IT THERE IS. OUR OUR L. YOUR REVENUES ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PART OF THE REASON I DON'T KNOW BRIAN IF YOU CAN. SETTLEMENT YEAH I MEAN I THINK ONE FACTOR THAT SOME PLAY HERE IS JUST THE KIND OF THE POINT IN THE ECONOMIC CYCLE OR AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF THOSE EARLIER YEARS AND WE WERE HAVING KIND OF MORE TURBULENT BUDGETS IN THE ECONOMY WAS. JUST COMING OUT OF THE RECESSION AND IT WAS A LITTLE HARDER TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE IT WHAT'S THE PATH IT'S GOING TO TAKE OVER THE NEXT YEAR. AS THE RECOVERIES YOU KNOW KIND OF MOVED ALONG WE'VE WE'VE BEEN KIND OF STEADILY TRENDING UPWARD IN A WAY THAT. NOT JUST OUR OFFICES BUT THE KIND OF THE CONSENSUS ECONOMIC FORECAST SO WE BOTH LOOK TO. YOU KNOW THEY'VE ALL KIND OF TENDED TOWARDS TO GATHER AROUND YOU KNOW A MORE. TIGHT CONSENSUS AS YOU KNOW THE STRAINS OF ALL KIND OF CONTINUED ON GRADUALLY- YOU KNOW I THINK AS AS AS GAVE IS MENTIONED YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE'S MAYBE SOME. SOME GROWING RISKS THAT SOME OF THAT TURBULENCE COULD BE COMING BACK IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS YOU KNOW WE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DON'T. FORECASTERS SESSIONS AND SO THAT IS YOU KNOW PART OF WHY WE CONTINUE ON THAT KIND OF GRADUAL TREND- SO I THINK YOU KNOW KIND OF THE- THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF WHY. WE'RE MAYBE A LITTLE CLOSER THAN WE HAVE BEEN IN SOME OF THE PAST YEARS. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M GONNA MOVE QUICKLY INTO OUR- RECESSION MITIGATION TO THE LA ALL. IN THE HANDOUT YOU GAVE US TODAY YOU AGAIN ENCOURAGE A LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHETHER IT WE'RE SATISFIED WITH THE LEVEL THE LEVEL OF RESERVES PROPOSED- IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- I CONTINUE TO BE. CURIOUS AS TO YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOU THINK THE APPROPRIATE. LEVEL OF RESERVE SHOULD BE. IF YOU COULD FIND ON THAT YEAH WELL. IT RELEASED THE TARGET YES IT'S THE- KIND OF. SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IT IS. AGAINST OVERSIGHT- SO I THINK. IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU VIEW THE WORLD IN CERTAIN WAYS ONE IS WHAT KIND OF A RECESSION ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING PREPARING FOR- THE MORE SEVERE THE RECESSION THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY GREATER CUSHION THAT YOU WOULD NEED. AND THEN ALSO WHAT IS THE STATE'S CURRENT SPENDING TRAJECTORY RELATIVE TO ITS REVENUE GROWTH- IN THE THROUGHOUT THE MULTI YEAR PERIOD AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN THOSE TWO- VARIABLES THAN. THE SHORTFALL REVENUE THAT WOULD OCCUR IN A RECESSION AND WOOD MORE IMMEDIATELY NEED TO BE OFFSET BY EITHER USE OF RESERVES OR CUTS TO PROGRAMS OR SOME KIND OF INCREASED REVENUES SO WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE SOME SOME ESTIMATING OF WHAT THE EFFECT OF A RECESSION WOULD BE AND WE TOOK WHEN WE DID OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK IN THE FALL WE TOOK THE AVERAGE- TYPE OF RECESSION SINCE WORLD WAR TWO THERE BEEN TWELVE RECESSIONS WE KIND OF AVERAGE THE- THE METRICS THAT. WITH THAT- THOSE REPRESENTED AND WHEN YOU DID THAT AND YOU COMPARED IT TO THE STATE'S CURRENT RISEN PROJECTED RESERVES AT THAT TIME PLUS WHAT WE VENN PROJECTED THE- BUDGET SURPLUS TO BE. ASSUMING NO NEW COMMITMENTS ARE MADE OUR OUTLOOK SAID WELL YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE PRETTY CLOSE TO HAVING ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THAT BUT OF COURSE IF YOU YEAH THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS MAKE NEW COMMITMENTS- HEN THEN THAT PICTURE COULD CHANGE AND THEN WE ALSO POINTED OUT YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING TODAY ABOUT THE OTHER RISKS THAT ARE OUT THERE SO IF YOU HAD A RECESSION IN ANY OF THOSE OTHER RHYS HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME. THEN IT WOULD BE- EVEN MORE OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU HAVE AND WHAT YOU WOULD NEED BUT I THINK- I THINK- IN GENERAL THE STATE IS MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS. AND AT END OF THE DAY THIS THE ANSWER ISN'T THE SADDEST BECAUSE I THINK. TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE IS READY REALLY DEPENDS ON THE COLLECTIVE RISK TOLERANCE OF THE KEY DECISION MAKERS. THANK YOU- MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN WHAT ARE YOU COMFORTABLE. KIND OF WAYNE IN IN TERMS OF ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION- DO YOU THINK YOUR PROPOSAL LEAVES THE STATE AND OR OR WHERE DO YOU THINK YOUR PROPOSAL LEAVES THE STATE. IN A POSITION IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO MINUTE MITIGATE OUR MANAGE OUR WAY THROUGH UP AT LEAST A MODERATE RECESSION SCENARIO. YES SO ALL MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS- THE FIRST IS OUR OVERALL RECESSION SCENARIO WHICH WE RAN AGAIN IS SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR WHICH IS WHERE IN A RECESSION THAT IS. MAYBE NOT QUITE AS SEVERE AS WHAT WE SAW DURING THE GREAT RECESSION BUT STILL PRETTY SEVERE WE COULD EXPERIENCE REVENUE DROPS OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN A SINGLE YEAR AND UP TO NEARLY SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS. OVER THREE YEARS TO SIR CERTAINLY WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO. HOW PREPARED WE FEEL I THINK THE FIRST POINT I MAKE IS ARE PROJECTED RESERVES LEVEL OF TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. IS NOT ONLY- HI FOR CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S ALSO IF YOU COMPARE TO OTHER STATES AND YOU LOOK AT IT AS A PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL GENERAL FUND SPENDING- WORK COMFORTABLY IN THE UPPER TIER AT COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND I THINK THAT WAS REFLECTED. IN THE RATINGS UPGRADE- THAT WE RECEIVED- LAST YEAR AFTER THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN REST EASY TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IS NOT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS OR FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. BUT I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE NOW THAT WERE IN THIS POSITION. THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IT SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS MADE LAST YEAR WERE AS YOU KNOW FOR SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PENSION PAY DOWN AS WELL AS TO PAY OFF THE WALL JACK. AND SO THESE ARE INVESTMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR COULD HAVE SAID HEY WE DON'T WANT TODO THESE THINGS WE WANT TO PUT THEM INTO RESERVES. AND THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE RESERVES LEVEL EVEN HIGHER MAYBE IT WOULD'VE BEEN TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS- BUT WE ALSO THOUGHT THAT THESE OTHER PRIORITIES BUILD FISCAL RESILIENCY AS WELL AND OF COURSE THE DEBATE THAT WE OFTEN HAD THESE. RESERVES VERSUS. SPENDING ON ONE TIME OR ONGOING PROGRAMS BUT IT'S ALSO WE'RE THINKING A ABOUT RESERVES PERSIST. ON PAID ARE PAN OFF OTHER. I'M SO WEEKS UP A SLIGHT LOWER. WHILE BUT WE DO THINK THOSE. IN FACT THEY ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL BENEFIT US OVER THE LONGER TERM. AND THEN THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE IS THAT WITH THAT BSA IN A YOU MENTION THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. WITH THE DEPOSIT PROJECTED THIS YEAR WILL BE AT NINE POINT 8% OF THAT. CONCERT TOUR THE CONSTITUTIONAL 10% CAP- AND THAT'S JUST WHAT THE MANDATORY DEPOSIT SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT. MANDATORY FOR AB PLUS DISCRETIONARY WERE ABOUT SO I THINK IT'S WORTH A DISCUSSION I'M SURE THE LA- HAS THOUGHTS ON THIS AS WELL. AS WEATHER 10% IS ENOUGH OR WHETHER WE SHOULD BE PUTTING MONEY IN OTHER PLACES OF COURSE LAST YEAR. WE PUT MONEY IN THE SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM THE BSA. BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED AT THE ESSAY- WITH THE HOPE THAT WOULD BE FILLED UP ALL GOES WELL. IN THE BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE WILL BE ATTHAT 10% LEVEL FOR MANDATORY DEPOSITS. AND SPEAKER THE BSA TO THE YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE- THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO GROW THE RESEARCH. DEFINITELY EITHER THROUGH VIA. LIKE THE SAFETY NET RESERVE DEPOSITS ME TOO SO TO USE THE BSA PROCESS IS THE PROPER THING TO DO. SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT RESERVES ACCOUNTS INCLUDING THE SAFETY NET RESERVE VENDORS ALSO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM RESERVE- SO I THINK THAT'S A DISCUSSION- WE DEFINITELY. YOU KNOW WOULD BE INTERESTED AND IN TERMS OF. IF WE WANT TO BUILD ADDITIONAL DESERVES WHAT WE HAVE. RESERVES BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE. HOW TO DO THAT- I THINK IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF SLOWING GROWTH AT THAT THAT DOES ACTUALLY COME TO PASS- MOST OF ANY AVAILABLE MONEY- MAY BE ALLOCATED TO DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS RATHER THAN RESERVES- BUT- YOU KNOW SHOULD THERE BE ADDITIONAL REVENUES WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUR RESILIENCY. YES I AM FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. WE THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. THAT ALMOST AS IF YOU KNOW THE FIRST QUESTION BEFORE IT MIGHT BE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT IS COMFORTABLE WITH. THE LEVEL OF DISCRETIONARY RESERVES AND- JUST MAKING NOTE I AM ME AND MENTIONED IT A LITTLE BIT AGO BUT- JUST MAKING NOTE THAT RECENT BUDGETS HAVE TAKEN PART OF THE SURPLUS AND USED IT TO BUILD UP LARGER STE- DISCRETIONARY RESERVE SUCH AS THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. AND THAT THOSE WOULD BE- AT. THE ALTERNATIVES THE YOU COULD CONSIDER AND- AND WOULD CERTAINLY- IT ADD TO THE STATE'S BUDGET RESILIENCE. BUT AGAIN- YOU KNOW. IF THE IF THAT WASN'T THE CHOICE THAN WE THINK YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER. MAINTAINING SOME DEGREE OF OPERATINGSURPLUS- IN THE IN THE MULTI YEAR PLAN- IT MAY BE SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE KIND OF THE SIMILAR EFFECT. IN A WAY YOU COULD THINK OF THE- OPERATING SURPLUSES KIND OF YOUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF A RECESSION IT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING TO ABSORB. THE SHORTFALL SO THAT WOULD BE ONE ALTERNATIVE IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO USE YOU KNOW MAKE A- A DISCRETE DEPOSIT. LAST FOR ME. MY COLLEAGUES DELF QUITE DEEPLY INTO MANY THE SPENDING PROPOSAL SO I WILL JUST. ASK ONE QUESTION ONE IS REALLY KIND OF PROCEDURAL. WE'RE CLEAR THAT A NUMBER OF YOUR PROPOSALS WILL REQUIRE STATUTORY CHANGES. THREE ONE OF THE LEGISLATURE BE RECEIVING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR ALL YOUR PROPOSALS IN FEBRUARY IF NOT IF YOU COULD LET US KNOW WHEN WE CAN EXPECT TO GET THAT LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT'S ME THE STUFF IT'S NOT JUST DOLLARS AND SUSAN COLLINS IT'S REAL. STATUTORY WE'LL HAVE THAT STORY IMPACTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO PROCESS ALL OF THAT FLOWS FEBRUARY REASONABLE OR NOT YES SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET AS MANY OF OUR PROPOSALS AT RELEASED ON FEBRUARY FIRST AS POSSIBLE AND YOU I'M SURE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE HEARING MY COLLEAGUES AND I WERE ALL GONNA RUN BACK TO FINANCE AND- CONTINUE PLUGGING AWAY ON THAT. THERE ARE CERTAIN NUMBER PROPOSALS- INCLUDING SOME OF THAT VERY NEW CONCEPTS OF THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED WHERE WE HAVE- WE DO NEED ADDITIONAL TIME- AND WHAT LOOKING MORE TOWARD A SPRING RELEASE OF THAT LANGUAGE IN THE PROPOSAL BUT WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT THE WAY TO RE RELEASE THOSE PROPOSALS THE LAST TIME THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO CONSIDER THEM- SO WE ARE WORKING TO GET THEM OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WE WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH BUDGET STAFF ON THE- SPRING AS IN PRE MAY REVISE. PULSE MAY REVISE EARLY SPRING. WHERE ARE YOU. OR YOU BUT YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE. PROPOSALS COMING OUT MAY REFER. DOING A BUDGET WINDOW BUT S. WE'LL BE IN CLOSE TOUCH INTO OKAY WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF THE TIME WHEN THOSE WILL BE. ONE MORE QUESTION- FOR ME ON SPIN PROPOSALS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS FOR NEW DEPARTMENT TORE REORGANIZATIONS OR NEW NAMES I THINK. MY BONE OF CONTENTION IS THE NEW NAMES. BECAUSE BECAUSE IT JUST RENAME THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T NECESSARILY YOU KNOW CANNELLA CULTURE SHIFT. I DON'T THINK THE NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT NECESSARILY ASK THE YOU KNOW. REFLECT WHAT EVER ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES THAT THE- ADMINISTRATION SEEMS APPROPRIATE AND SO WHAT'S THE COST ESTIMATE. FOR CHANGING THE NAME OF AN ORGANIZATION. SO I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU OKAY I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT. ALL RIGHT THINK ANY OF CLOSING REMARKS FROM EVEN IF YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO- HAVE LENGTHY CONVERSATION NOT IN THE OVERSIGHT HEARING ANY. CLOSING COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH ANY OF US. BEFORE I OPENED IT UP TO- PUBLIC COMMENT THAT'S ALREADY QUEUING UP ANYTHING FROM THE GENTLEMAN. ALL RIGHT OF PUBLIC COMMENT WITH THE OUR OF A QUARTER TO ONE HAVING ARRIVED I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ALL TO BE PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE SO THINK THAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN ALL MORNING. ADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BRENDAN TO ACHE. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS THAT SEE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM ALL THIRTY FIVE LOCAL THEIR DISTRICTS. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS REGARDING THE- EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITY YEAR PROTECTION. LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING CUTS- I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE WAS FIFTY MILLION FOR LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND THE YEAR BEFORE- AND THE BREAKDOWN WAS IT WAS TWENTY MILLION FROM THE- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. AND THIRTY MILLION FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND. SO THIS BUDGET- PROVIDES A BOMB OF. OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS MONEY FROM TWENTY MILLION UP TO TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S THE CAP AND TRADE MONEY. BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE IT COMPLETELY ZEROS OUT THE THIRTY MILLION. IN AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUNDING OF IT'S GOING TO HAVE A DRAMATIC AT AND NEGATIVE IMPACT. ON THE PROGRAM- AIRED AT COMMUNITIES AND AIR DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN WORKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- TO REDUCE. EMISSIONS WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS VERY WORTHY IMPORTANT. COMMUNITY FOCUS PROGRAM- IT WILL REDUCE OUR SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS. THERE'S REAL PUBLIC HEALTH **** CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS CUT IS NOW OCCURRING AT A TIME. WHEN YOU'RE EXPANDING THE PROGRAM FROM TEN COMMUNITIES TO THIRTEEN. SO AND THE OTHER THING IS I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. OF THE PROGRAM FRANKLY HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDER FUNDED SO. IT WE SEE THE REAL COST AT CLOSER TO A HUNDRED MILLION. ANNUALLY WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THAT THE ADDITION OF NEW COMMUNITIES AND SO IN ORDER TO DO THE WORK WELL IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PROMISE OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN. IT REQUIRES INTENSIVE RESOURCES AND SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE ALSO WOULD LOOK FOR INCREASED INCENTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRORAM AS WELL AND OF COURSE WE'LL DELVE INTO THIS MORE IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE CAPSULE HAS YOU AS YOU RECALL YOU'LL HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M GOING TO ASK. MEMBERS TO THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO HELP KEEP YOUR COMMENTS WITH IN A TWO MINUTE TIME FRAME NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU REMEMBER FROST BUCKLEY ON BEHALF OF SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT I KEEP MY COUNTRY FREE ASSOCIATES. ARE CAUGHT TO THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER ABOUT THE DISH ONLY FOR SIX SEVENTEEN FUNDING AND PICKERS RELATES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION CENTER DOLLARS THANKS. ALLEN ABS WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT- IS BURNED INTO A NOTED- RIGHT NOW WE'VE WERE UP TO THIRTEEN COMMUNITIES IN THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM FOR THE BAY AREA- SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE THE WEST OAKLAND IN THE RICHMOND SAN PABLO AREA. HOWEVER WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES IN THERE'S PROMISES THAT- WE COMMUNITIES OF VALLEJO- SOUTH SAN JOSE- SOUTH OF SAN FRANCISCO- TRI VALLEY AREA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE BAY AREA CAN BE ADDED TO THE SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM AND SO IT'S- REALLY DISCONCERTING TO SEE THAT WE'RE GETTING A 50% CUT. IN AB SIX SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE EXPANDING COMMUNITIES- THE MEMBERS MAY HAVE SEEN THAT- IT ONE OF THE UNIQUE THINGS WE'VE DONE IN THE SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM IN THE BAY AREA. IS WERE CURRENTLY- DRIVING- ELECTRIC VEHICLES WITH SENSORS ON EVERY ROAD IN THE BAY AREA- FOR THE NEXT YEAR TWENTY TIMES. TO GET A HEAT MAP OF ALL THE AIR POLLUTION SOURCES- AND THEN BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY TO FIND OUT. US WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SO IT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING. A CULT LIKE THIS WILL BE DEVASTATING TO NOT ONLY THAT PROGRAM BUT TO PROGRAMS IN FUTURE COMMUNITIES. I HOPE THE COMMITTEE- WILL SEE FIT TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTER GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S BRIAN BEVERAGE ON THE CO DIRECTOR OF THE WEST OAKLAND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS PROJECT AND WE WERE THE COMMUNITY PARTNER WITH THE- BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT ON THE- R. A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN AIR PLAN. THE FIRST OF THE STATE- SO WE WERE KIND OF THE GUINEA PIGS. AND I WANNA- I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM SENATOR BALANCE AND SKINNER- PARTICULAR COMMENTS AROUND. FINDING PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN CONTINUING TO FUND THEM. A COMMON- TO YEAH I THINK WE- WENT TO THE POINT OF. WE NEED- POPULATIONS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY ISSUES TO BE- TO BRING FORTH THEIR THEIR PERSPECTIVE. SO THAT WE GET GOOD SOLUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. AND ULTIMATELY WE NEED TO CUT ACROSS AGENCY SILOS. SO THAT WE GET- COLLABORATION BETWEEN AGENCIES AND WE'RE- WE'RE ONLY A MONTH INTO OUR IMPLEMENTATION. AND WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE CITY OF OAKLAND THE PORT OF OAKLAND THE AIR DISTRICT. AND LOCAL DEVELOPERS. TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE USE MULTIPLES RESOURCE- MULTIPLE SOURCES OF RESOURCES TO BRING ABOUT THIS PLAN TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS. OF AIR QUALITY POLLUTION IN OUR COMMUNITY TO THIS REALLY IS A PROGRAM THAT'S TURNING OUT THAT IT WORKS. HAND WASH IT WOULD BE A BUT IT WOULD BE A SAD TIME AT THIS MOMENT WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE AND I THINK THIS COULD ACTUALLY BE DUPLICATED ACROSS OTHERS OTHER- SITUATIONS AND OTHER SOCIAL CONDITIONS SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI WITH NOTES TO KNOW. HI IT'S NANCY. MY NAME IS MISS MARGARET GORDON I'M THE ONE THE FOUNDERS OF THE CODE OF THE WAY OAKLAND IN PROJECT THIS IS MY SIXTH GENERATION A WEST OAKLAND RESIDENT- I DO NOT WANT TO SEE TWENTY FIVE MORE YEARS. OF POLLUTION BEEN IMPACTED ON HER I WANNA FOR BECAUSE OF LACK OF SB SIX ONE SEVEN LIKE BROWN TO SAY WE WAS THE FIRST COMMUNITY OBLIGATE THE DOING THE STEERING COMMITTEE PROCESS OF UP WE ARE CALLING BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING OUR OWN THEIR MONITORING OF ALMOST TWENTY YEARS I HAVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE INVESTED. IN THIS PROCESS AND MY LEGACY IS ALSO BEHIND SB SIX ONE SEVEN. I DO NOT WANT TO BE SET UP FOR FAILURE BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY DON'T TRUST GOVERNMENT ALREADY WE HAVE. HAD TO GO TO A LOT OF TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS TO GET THE RESIDENTS TO WANT TO BE ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF OUR ISSUES WITH IN WEST LOCAL RAP POLLUTION SO IS NOT THIS IS NOT TIME TO DO IN THE CUTTING. THIS I TIME TO TRY TO REALLY GO TO ANOTHER LEVEL THIS IS A TIME TO PUT THIS ON A NATIONAL PLATFORM THAT YOU HAVE THIS PROCESS GOING AND. DAHLE SET US UP FOR FAILURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS TWO MEN. HI MY NAME'S WILLIAM. I'M A RE YOU BERKELEY MEAN BOTH THE CITY PER AND PUBLIC HEALTH. SO I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING SB SIX ONE SEVEN GOING ALONG WITH WHAT WAS SAID BEFORE AND IT'S THE TOPIC MY MASTER'S THESIS. SO MY RESEARCH SO FAR SHOWS THAT THIS IS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL PROCESS. THE BAY AREA- DISTRICT HAS WORKED IN THE SPIRIT THE REAL SPIRIT OF EIGHTY SIX AND SEVEN TO MAKE THE PROCESS TRULY COMMUNITY DRIVEN AND COMMUNITY LEAD. WHICH IS AMAZING. AND PRESIDENT SETTING THE WEST OAKLAND PLAN GENERATED- IS STANCE REDUCE KEY HEALTH BURDENS IN THE COMMUNITY SUCH AS THE HIGH RATE OF ASTHMA IN CHILDREN AS YOU JUST SAW- MISS MARKETS GREAT DAN GRANDDAUGHTER. AND INCREASE CANCER RISK MY RESEARCH ALSO INDICATES THAT AB SIX ONE SEVEN CAN IMPROVE THESE HEALTH IMPACTS BUT FUNDING MUST CONTINUE AT THE CURRENT LEVEL. NOT REDUCED OR INCREASE TO MEET THESE HEALTH GOALS- THE PLAN ALSO OFFERS CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO LONG STANDING POLLUTION ISSUES. BY AS BRIAN SAID TO BRING TOGETHER NOT ONLY COMMUNITY MEMBERS BUT THE PORT THE CITY THE HEALTH. AUTHORITY ALL WORKING TOGETHER FOR THESE GOALS AND BREAKING DOWN SILOS SO IT GOES BEYOND A PARTICIPATORY MODEL INTO AN INTEGRATED PLANNING MODEL WHICH ME AND MY PROFESSOR BELIEVE. IS TRULY CUTTING EDGE IN PLANNING. A I ALSO SAY THAT BUT CUTS STAND IF THEY HAPPEN STAND TO REPLICATE HISTORIC PATTERNS OF POLICY VOLATILITY. AND THAT FAILED TO DELIVER CHANGES PROMISES LEGISLATION AND STAND TO GRADE COMMUNITIES TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. WE NEED TO FIND SB SIX ONE SEVEN. TWO RIGHT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SEEN HISTORIC- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS TO REALLY HEAL THEMSELVES FROM THESE ISSUES THAT THEY DID NOT BECAUSE SO I SAY PLEASE. CONTINUE TO FUND THIS BECAUSE OTHER STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE LOOKING AT A. B. SIX AND SEVEN AS A MODEL. FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE LEGISLATION AND CLIMATE LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES. MADAM CHAIRMAN TOMIC TOMORROW HERE BEHALF OF THE SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. I WOULD ALSO SINCE HE MY COMMENTS HEY WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS RELATIVE TO. A BE SIX ONE SEVEN AND ITS EFFECT ON THE COMMUNITY HIGHLIGHTING THESE ISSUES ONE THE COLLABORATION. BETWEEN VERY DIFFERENT GROUPS ACROSS THE BOARD IN IMPLEMETING SIX ONE SEVEN HAS BEEN REMARKABLE AND THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT HERE'S SEEN GREAT. STRIDES IN THE COLLABORATION WORKING WITH A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT DISADVANTAGED AREAS HIS SECOND ISSUE WOULD BE MORE MONEY IS BETTER THAN LESS. AND THE THIRD ISSUE IS I WAS DRAWN TO THE DOCTOR PANTS COMMENTS EARLIER WHERE HE SAID THAT IF WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH THEIR QUALITY THAN WE'RE DEALING WITH ASTHMA IN CHILDREN. WE'RE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR THIS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER I BELIEVE THAT MY CLIENT'S POSITION WOULD BE LET'S PAY FOR IT ON THE FRONT END. AND NOT DEAL WITH THE ASTHMA IN THE LONG RUN AND THEREFORE FUND THESE PROGRAMS THAT HAVEN'T SO PROMISING AND JUST GETTING STARTED. SO THEREFORE I GUESS SAID I'D HOW WE SUPPORT MORE FUNDING RATHER THAN LESSEN THE SIR THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON ANY ON. DIRECTOR BRIGHT LINE DEFENSE WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO SERVING LOW INCOME TENANTS AS WELL AS VERY LOW INCOME TENANTS. AROUND AIR QUALITY ISSUES AND WE ALSO BUILD UP YOUTH LEADERSHIP COHORTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL. AND WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MADE PRIOR SPEAKERS BUT ALSO ONE MORE THING TO ADD IS THAT. THIS PROGRAM EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN ALLOWS US TO TEST OUT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES ON A VERY LOCALIZED SCALE ALLOWS US TO MOVE QUICKLY ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND ALLOWS US TO SCALE THEM UP. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL A COUPLE POLICIES TO RATTLE OFF WOULD BE THINGS LIKE KERR FREE STREETS BUSTLE EDUCATION CLEAN ROOM INFRASTRUCTURE AND STUDYING WILDFIRE IMPACTS. TO LOCAL BUILDING HOUSING STOCK INSERTING LAND USE POLICY THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE CAN TEST OUT UNDER EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN. AND THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE IN THIS PROGRAM SO MUCH AND THAT CUTTING AWAY THE FUNDING RIGHT NOW CUTS AWAY AT THE EQUITY ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE A CENTERPIECE OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDING TO BEGIN WITH. SO WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY RESTORED BUT HOPEFULLY UP MORE BECAUSE THIS IS A SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED PROGRAM TO BEGIN WITH. AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNIZE OF COURSE SENATOR SKINNER SENATOR PENN CENTER LEYVA FOR THEIR COMMENTS AROUND EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.
