YEAH. THIS IS FILE ITEM TWENTY SEVEN A CA ONE. CORPORATE ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY AND OTHERS NATURALLY THE LOCAL FINANCE MS AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TO PRESENT A CA ONE A LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE TO ASK OUR STATE'S VOTERS IF THEY WILL REDUCE THE NECESSARY VOTER THRESHOLD FOR LOCAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FROM TWO THIRDS TO A 55% SUPERMAJORITY. UNDER CURRENT LAW 55% IS THE SAME VOTE THRESHOLD THAT IS NEEDED FOR LOCAL SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BONDS. IN OUR STATES DEMOCRACY ONE NO VOTE SHOULD NOT COUNT TWICE AS MUCH AS ONE VOTE IN FAVOR OF LOCAL INVESTMENT IN NEW HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WITH THE PAST ACA ONE WE ARE ONLY ASKING VOTERS TO DECIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE LOST CRITICAL TOOLS TO FUND PRIORITY PROJECTS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES LIKE REDEVELOPMENT. THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FUND EVERY LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE PRIORITY. A CA ONE WOULD PERMIT ARE LOCALS TO ASK THEIR VOTERS IF THEY SUPPORT BONDS OR SPECIAL TAXES THAT HAVE A SPECIAL SPECIFIC EXPENDITURE PLAN. CITIZENS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ANNUAL AUDITS AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS. MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY SUFFER FROM CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE FAILING WATER SYSTEMS RUN DOWN POLICE AND FIRE STATIONS AND THE LACK OF PARKS AND RECREATION NOT TO MENTION STATEWIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. THIS MEASURE WILL EMPOWER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TACKLE LOCAL PRIORITIES AS WELL AS BECOMING STRONGER PARTNERS IN LEVERAGING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDING. ALL. I ASK WITH A CA ONE IS FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND LETTING THE VOTERS DECIDE. TO BE CLEAR. NOTHING IN THIS BILL INCREASES ANYONE'S TAXES NOTHING IN THIS BILL REQUIRES A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PROPOSE A FUNDING MEASURE TO ITS VOTERS. WHAT THIS BILL DOES. WHAT IT DOES DO IS PRESENT THE QUESTION TO OUR VOTERS OF WHETHER OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A REALISTIC FINANCING MECHANISM TO HELP THEM BEST SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. ACA ONE WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BY PROVIDING PARITY BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS SO THAT ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL HELP YOU WILL HAVE AN EQUALLY VIABLE FINANCING TOOL TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS. WITH A VOTE IN SUPPORT OF A CA ONE TODAY WE ARE PROVIDING OUR VOTERS WITH THE POWER TO GIVE THEIR LOCAL LEADERS THE ABILITY TO PRIORITIZE. AND SEEK FUNDING FOR PROJECTS THEY NEED IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS AGUIAR-CURRY MR FRAZIER YOUR RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AS CO AUTHOR ENSURE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I RISE IN TOTAL TOTAL SUPPORT FOR A CA ONE. ACA WILL PROVIDE THIS LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH A REALISTIC FINANCING OPTION TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN SUPPORT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS HISTORICALLY FACE CHALLENGES IN SECURING FUNDING FOR IMPORTANT LOCAL PUBLIC PROJECTS. INVESTING COMMITTEE PROJECTS PAYS OFF IN MULTIPLE WAYS INCLUDING HOUSING CLOSER TO THEIR JOBS AND LIVING IN AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE A CHOICE OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. THIS BILL PROVIDES CLEAR VERY CLEAR LANGUAGE TO ENSURE FUNDING IS SPENT APPROPRIATELY INCLUDING SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR VOTER PROTECTION. PUBLIC NOTICE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY. AS A HUGE SUPPORTER OF THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND THE SELF HELP COUNTIES THROUGH THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE THERE'S TWENTY FOUR OF THEM NOW. THERE CAN TO CONTRIBUTING THROUGH THEIR. ONLY MEASURES FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND HELPING THE STATE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. MAKING INVESTMENT IN THEIR LOOK LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WITHOUT THAT WILLINGNESS TO DO SO THESE CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD BE FAR BEHIND WHERE THEY'RE AT NOW I RICHER AYE VOTE. THANKS FOR YOUR DOCTOR CHOI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER AND A COLLEAGUE SIDE RISE SAW IN STRONG OPPOSITION OF A CA ONE. COLLEAGUES SO THE PURPOSE SET IN OUR CONSTITUTION IS VERY CLEAR IN REGARDS TO A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE IN TAX RELATED MATTERS. BORDERS TO HAVE A REPEAT IT IS SUPPORTED THE TWO THIRDS REQUIREMENT SO SET IN THE CONSTITUTION THROUGH A PROPOSITIONS ARE LIKE A PROP THIRTEEN SIX A TWO AND A TWO HUNDRED SIX EIGHTEEN. BY REMOVING THIS OF THRESHOLD DON'T WE ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO RAISE OUR TAXES ON ALREADY OVER TAXED TO STATE. ISN'T IT ENOUGH FOR THOUGHT WE ARE ALREADY PAYING HIGHEST ATTACKS ARE IN THE COUNTRY. IN MANY AREAS. THE PURPOSE IS TABLETS DOWN IN SETTING THE TWO THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE THOUGHT FOR TAXES WAS TO CAPTURE THE ENTIRE POPULATION ONE MAJORITY WHAT TWO OR TWO THIRDS DEVASTATED. NOT JUST OR A SEGMENT THE WHOLE OF THE. TAXPAYERS IF WE REMOVE THIS A PROTECTION THE DAMAGES SO AND THE EFFECTS SO IT WOULD BE FAR REACHING FOR THESE REASONS I STRONGLY URGE YOU KNOW VOTE. MR OF REALTY YOUR ADDRESS I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO A CA ONE. THIS BILL WOULD LOWER THE VOTING THRESHOLD FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INCUR BONDED INDEBTEDNESS FROM THE TWO THIRDS REQUIRED IN PROP 13255% THE TWO THIRDS REQUIRED. OF MAKING THESE GOVERNMENTAL DECISIONS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE VOTE THRESHOLD AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE DECISION TO ENTER INDEBTEDNESS IS AMONG THE MOST SERIOUS DECISIONS THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAKE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT AN EXPENDITURE THE JUST OCCURS THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN MOST CASES GOING INTO DEBT FOR TWENTY YEARS. WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO BORROW MONEY. THAT MEANS YOU'RE CHOOSING TO REPAIR IT OVER TIME WITH INTEREST SO EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE BORROW TODAY. TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR ROAD REPAIR WE COULD DO TWICE AS MUCH AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR REPAIR TWICE AS MANY ROADS IF WE CHOSE TO PAY AS WE GO INSTEAD OF GOING INTO DEBT. SO THE DECISION TO IT BONDED DEBT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ONE. THAT IS APPROPRIATELY A REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE THRESHOLD. BUT I'VE A FURTHER CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL AND THAT IS BECAUSE THE BONDS THAT ARE FINANCED BY THESE TAXES ARE PAID BY PROPERTY TAXES WHICH WILL INVARIABLY INCREASE THE COST OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ALL KNOW. DIRE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THE COST OF HOUSING HERE ALREADY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST POVERTY OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST HOMELESSNESS OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. THIS BILL WILL MAKE THAT SITUATION MORE. BUT COLLEAGUES. YOU CAN ARGUE. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT HURTING. WE'VE GOT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. THAT ARE FLIRTING WITH BANKRUPTCY I HAVE ONE OF THE CITIES IN MY DISTRICT. IS TALKING ABOUT DISSING CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A ENOUGH REVENUE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS. BUT HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT WE GET A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS AT THE STATE LEVEL THIS YEAR. COLLEAGUES WHAT WE HEAR IS NOT A REVENUE PROBLEM IT IS A REVENUE ALLOCATION PROBLEM. LASTLY. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE AND YOU LOOK AT THE VOTE THRESHOLD THERE WAS REQUIRED THEIR OF TWO THIRDS AND YOU TALLY ALL OF THE BONDS THAT PASSED DID YOU KNOW THAT OVER 80% OF THE BONDS ON THE BALLOT LAST CYCLE PASSED OVER EIGHTY PERCENT. SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE VOTE THRESHOLD. WHAT DO YOU THINK. MESSAGE RATE WE WANT MORE THAN 80% OF THE VOTE THESE BONDS TO PASS. COLLEAGUES THIS BILL IS BAD FOR CALIFORNIA IT MORTGAGES OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE FOR THE SAKE OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY TODAY AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE NOW. MISTER DAVID CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP. I'M PLEASED TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR IN THIS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY MEASURE. YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE WE ALL KNOW THIS THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT THRESHOLD FOR LOCAL. MEASURES TIED THE HANDS OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THIS ACA'S CRITICAL TO ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO INVEST LOCAL DOLLARS BACK IN A HOUSING PROJECT INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. I WON A REMINDER COLLEAGUES A TWO YEARS AGO WE PLAYED THE STATE WIDE. AND AFFORDABLE HOW ONE PROPOSITION ONE ONLY NEEDED A SIMPLE MAJORITY TO PASS IT DID IF IT HAD BEEN LOCAL PARK SURE IT WOULD HAVE FAILED. REQUIREMENTS TOO MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD LOCAL MEASURES FAIL UNDER THIS BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY GOT WELL OVER A MAJORITY OF VOTES WE ARE ALLOWING IT 234% MINORITY TO RULE THE DAY. WE SPOKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE ARE SO MANY INTERSTATE. THAT NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE RESOURCES TO PAY FOR. FOR WHAT WE REALLY NEED NGUYEN DRESSES ISIS WE NEED TO ADDRESS A HOMELESSNESS ON OUR STREETS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR- THANK YOU MISTER CHIU MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK THANK A SPEAKER MEMBERS I'M RISING OBVIOUSLY IN OPPOSITION. I WANT US TO THINK VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES. OF REDUCING A THRESHOLD FOR PASSAGE. WITH REDUCING ACCOUNTABILITY AND REDUCING. THE PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT TO THE VOTERS THAT WE PRESENT THESE BONDS AND EXPENDITURES TO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT THE TWO THIRDS THRESHOLD HAS HISTORICALLY REQUIRED THE PROPONENTS OF THE DEATH. TO BE VERY CLEAR ON WHAT IT'S GOING TO GO FOR. WE HAVE SCHOOL BOARDS FOR EXAMPLE THAT I'VE SUPPORTED. BOND INCREASES FOR VERY GOOD REASONS WHY BECAUSE WHEN THEY WENT TO THE BALLOT BOX AND HAD TO GET THE TWO THIRDS THRESHOLD THEY WERE VERY VERY CLEAR. ABOUT THIS SCHOOL WILL RECEIVE THIS THIS WILL RECEIVE BACK THIS IS OUR PROMISE. THAT NUMBER TWO I COME FROM A SELF HELP COUNTY. ONE OF THE VERY FIRST POLITICAL. I INVOLVEMENTS WAS WITH MEASURES SEEK WHICH IS A TRANSPORTATION. TAX IT REQUIRES THE TWO THIRDS. IT HAS DONE WONDERS FOR OUR COMMUNITY IN FACT YOU CAN DRIVE AROUND THE FIFTH LARGEST CITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ABOUT A TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE MINUTE DRIVE TIME IN THE WORST. TRAFFIC LOCATIONS IT HAS BEEN OUT NOT ONLY PASSED BUT HAS BEEN PASSED AGAIN. WHY BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET TO THE TWO THIRDS THRESHOLD. IT REQUIRED US TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR. ON WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO WITH THE MONEY. I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LANGUAGE WITH RESPECT TO WELL THERE'S GOING TO BE OVERSIGHT AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS. MY POINT IS THAT AS YOU REDUCE THE VOTE THRESHOLD YOU INHERENTLY REDUCE THE OVERSIGHT. IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE ON NECESSARY TO BE VERY VERY SPECIFIC AND TO DEAL WITH THE THOSE WHO WOULD SAY I LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING A SELF HELP COUNTY BUT I WANT TO HAVE MORE. RESPONSIBILITY WITH MY VOTE TO BE ABLE TO REQUIRE THAT A PARTICULAR PROJECT BE ACCOMPLISHED AND BE DONE. SO I'M I'M I'M ASKING YOU TO RECONSIDER THE BASIC PREMISE HERE. THE HIGHER THRESHOLD NOT ONLY. GIVES THOSE WHO ARE PROPERTY OWNERS AND WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY IT. ALL THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE PROPONENTS AND I'VE BEEN ON THIS SIDE OF BEING A PROPONENT AND HAVING TO COME TO A TWO THIRDS VOTE AND TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE VOTERS. AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS IS OUR PROMISE TO YOU AND THE HIGHER THAT THRESHOLD THE MORE DIRECT AND CLEAR OUT WE HAVE BEEN. AND SO I WARN YOU AGAINST THE PRESUMPTION HERE THAT IF YOU RAISE YOUR REDUCE THE- THRESHOLD THAT YOU GET BETTER BOND EXPENDITURE I DON'T THINK YOU DO I THINK THE HIGHER THE THRESHOLD THE MORE SPECIFIC AND DIRECT A COMMITMENT. WE MUST MAKE IN ORDER TO GET IT PASSED IT IS NOT MERELY A PROTECTION FOR THOSE WHO WILL BEAR THE MOST BURDEN OF SPUR EXAMPLE PROPERTY TAX INCREASE. BUT IT IS A IT REALLY IS A GUARANTEE. THAT IF YOU ARE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE AND YOU PUT UP SIGNS ALL ACROSS YOUR SCHOOL BOARD LOCATIONS IN SCHOOLS A SAID THIS GETS A CAFETERIA THIS ONE GETS A- GYMNASIUM. THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT I THINK THE THRESHOLD. UP REQUIRES THE PROPONENTS TO DO. AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY FROM A THRESHOLD OF ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING A THRESHOLD ACCOUNTABILITY WE GET THOSE PASSED 80% OF THEM HAVE BEEN PASSED. I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE TOLD US HIGH AND SO THE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE TRANSPARENT AND RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE PROMISES AND THEN KEEP THEM IS ALSO A HIGH THRESHOLD. FOR THOSE REASONS I WOULD SUGGEST A NO VOTE. DOCTOR WOULD. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I'D I APPRECIATE THE DEBATE HERE AT I WOULD POINT OUT I BELIEVE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THAT. SCHOOL BOND MEASURES ARE AT 55% CURRENTLY. SO 55% IS THE NUMBER THAT I UNDERSTAND I ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE NOT THIS IS PAT VOTING TODAY DOES NOT PASS THIS THIS IS A MEASURE THAT GOES BEFORE THE VOTERS TO LET THE VOTERS DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE THRESHOLD OR NOT SO I RISE TO IT TODAY AS A CO AUTHOR TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE AND THE POSITIVE IMPACT IT COULD HAVE ON MY RURAL DISTRICT. COMMUNITIES IN RURAL CALIFORNIA DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MANY OF THE RESOURCES PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT PROVIDE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IT THAT URBAN COMMUNITIES DO FOR EXAMPLE BROADBAND INTERNET HINDERS EVERYONE FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL CHILDREN TO THE BILL COMMUNITY I DON'T HAVE IT WE DON'T HAVE IT FOR ECONOMIC FELLOW WE DON'T HAVE. FOR A LOT FOR EDUCATION. WE DON'T HAVE A- AREAS FOR TOP OF LIKE LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. IT IS MY COMMUNITIES THAT WANT TO RAISE A SPECIAL TAX OR A G. O. BOND DEFINED INFRASTRUCTURE OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. IN RURAL COMMUNITIES FACE SPECIAL CHALLENGES. EDUCATING VOTERS IN ADVOCATING FOR BALLOT MEASURES IN COMMUNITIES THAT CAN SPREAD OUT OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES CAN PROVE IMPOSSIBLE FOR SMALL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY STRAPPEDFOR RESOURCES. MEMBERS TO SIMPLE AMENDMENT IS THE KIND OF YOUR WE SHOULD BE PUTTING ON THE BALLOT. AND GIVEN THE VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THEY THAT WOULD MISTER COOLEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN THE AIR UNUSUAL PLACE OF ACTUALLY I KNOW A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES FAVOR THIS I ACTUALLY STRONGLY OPPOSE IT. AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK TO I THINK THE DISCIPLINE. OF ANY IN A COMMUNITY IN A TWO THIRDS CONVERSATION. IT ONLY A DISCIPLINE IN A DEMOCRACY THAT BROADENS PARTICIPATION SHARED COMMUNITY VALUES. CONFRONTS POLARIZATION. IT IS A SALVATORI EXPERIENCE TO HAVE TO SPEAK TO A LARGER COMMUNITY. WHEN A LONG TERM FINANCIAL GROUP IS BEING MADE. IN MY CAREER I PARTICIPATED IN NUMEROUS. BALLOT FIGHTS INVOLVED A TWO THIRDS VOTE AND ACTUALLY FEEL IT IS A WHOLESOME JUST WANTED DEMOCRACY TO HAVE TO REACH OUT TO BROAD LINES. I ACTUALLY. HAVE AN ISSUE SOME WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE ASPECTS OF THIS BILL THE TAX PIECES OF THE ONES A BOTHER ME WHEN I STARTED THIS BILL IN SO LONG AGO IT WAS BEFORE PROP THIRTEEN. NOW I REMEMBER THE MOST OF TAXATION GOING TO THE ROOF. AND IMPEDED MY ABILITY TO BUY A HOME. BECAUSE I WAS A RUNNER WHEN I STARTED HERE. IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE I KNOW YOUNG YOUNG COUPLES OUTSTANDING COUPLES CELLPHONE EMPLOYED COUPLES WITH WITH GOOD JOBS WORD ABOUT. BUYING A HOME IN CALIFORNIA. I KNOW YOUNG COUPLES ARE THINKING GEE MAYBE WE SHOULD UNDERTAKE TO GET OUT OF READING. FIND A WAY TO RUN A MOTOR HOME. AND LIVE THROUGH YOUR STARTED I TENER WAY TO SET ASIDE FUNDS SO THEY CAN SOLVE A CONUNDRUM OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. SO I'M ACTUALLY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE TAXATION PIECE OF THIS. I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS IT'S SUCH A BIG ARTICLE BECAUSE THIS IS A DEMOCRACY. THE GLOBE NEEDS EXAMPLES OF DEMOCRACIES THAT LISTEN EVERYBODY. THE PUBLIC POLICY DEBATE ACTUALLY RECKONS WITH THE VIEWS OF PEOPLE THEY'RE DIFFERENT TO BE. AND MOVE THE STATE FORWARD. I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA THINGS IMPORTANT IN THE GLOBAL. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL AS I SAY GOOD WITH INFRASTRUCTURE PRIESTS I THINK THE TAXATION PIECES BAD I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE BURDEN. THE CHALLENGER GET INTO TWO THIRDS I THINK THAT REQUIRES A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SKILL SET. SO THE CAMPAIGN I LOGS OF THE DEATH BUT ENGAGING PEOPLE LISTENING AND WORKING TO GROW CONSENSUS AROUND A FUTURE. WHETHER IT'S OF WHATEVER TYPE. WE'RE BASE OF THE CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT WHAT IS EXIST IN THE STATUS QUO IS INIMICAL TO THE WELL BEING OF PEOPLE. AND THEREFORE THEY WILL SERVE BY GOING TO DIFFERENT DIRECTION. WHICH CAN INCLUDE UNDERTAKING OF FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES YEAH IN MY OWN COUNTY I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN MEASURE REIN IN TWO THOUSAND FOR MY FIRST NINE MONTHS IS ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND WORKED THERE TWO THIRDS VOTE IN SECOND COUNTY AS A SELF HELP COUNTY. BUT THE IN EVENTS SO I LOOK AT THIS I ACTUALLY FEEL THERE'S IMPORTANT DEMOCRATIC VALUES IMPLICIT IN THIS I DON'T THINK THE TWO THIRDS IS AN INSUPERABLE BARRIER INDEED I THINK IT. TESSA BRUCEI COMMITTEE WHERE. YOU WORK THROUGH THE DIFFERENCES SO YOU PULL TOGETHER WORKING ON THE FUTURE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT ASSET. THERE WAS COOLEY MS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IS A CO AUTHOR IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF A CA ONE IT'S NO SECRET THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE TO MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THAT REALITIES COMPOUNDING ARE GROWING NEED ADDRESS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS BECAUSE I CLASS CHANGE POPULATION GROWS GROWTH DEFERRED FINANCE. IN ON TOP OF THAT WERE ASKING HER COMMUNITIES TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUPPORT OF HOUSING FOR CONSTITUENTS. SOMETHING THAT. SOMETIMES IS A LITTLE TOO DIVISIVE TO GET A TWO THIRDS AGREEMENT UPON WHERE THAT SHOULD BE. IT'S TIME WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR OUTDATED TWO THIRDS APPROVAL REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL MEASURES WHICH ONLY SERVES TO HAMSTRING OR COMMUNITIES FROM TAKING LOCAL PRIOR TEETH INTO THEIR OWN HANDS WITH A MAJOR PORT. FOR MAJORITY VOTE WHEN PROP THIRTY NINE PASSED WE LOWERED THE THRESHOLD FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION WANTS TO FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED HAS BEEN GOOD. AS WE SEE IN OUR SCHOOLS IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND OUR SCHOOLS WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF GOOD LOCAL JOBS WE'VE RE AND IN HER GREAT AT THE ECONOMY THE LOCAL ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME. AS DOING GOOD FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN DO THAT AGAIN TODAY. AC WHAT A CA ONE SIMPLY EMPOWERS VOTERS TO MAKE THAT DECISION TODAY I'D IT'S TIME TO LOWER THAT THRESHOLD I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN YOU'LL BE VOTING FOR THIS A CA WHEN IT'S ON YOUR BALLOTS MEANS. THAT YOU RESPECT YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO ALLOW THEM TO VOTE ON IT. THERE WAS GOODS ALSO MISTER BONTA YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE AS A CO AUTHOR AND A STRONG SUPPORTER OF A CA ONE A TWO THIRDS SUPERMAJORITY THRESHOLD AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS UNDEMOCRATIC. WHEN ONE THIRD PLUS ONE OF THE VOTERS TERMINA FUTURE FOR A LOCALITY AND UP OUT VOTE TWO THIRDS MY ONE OF THE VOTERS SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG. THE TWO THIRDS MAJORITY THREE. BONDS AND TAXES BUYS ON THE FALSE PREMISE THAT THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO WISH TO INVEST IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY ARE SOMEHOW. LESS VALID. LESS IMPORTANT AND LESS VALUED THAN THOSE WHO OPPOSE THOSE INVESTMENTS. IT'S WRONG THAT WE REQUIRE THAT TWO OF OUR CONSTITUENTS VOTE IN SUPPORT OF LOCAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING PUBLIC SAFETY OR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS FOR EVERY ONE. PERSON WHO SIMPLY SAYS NOW. NOW MORE THAN EVER OUR COMMUNITIES NEED EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS HOUSING CRISIS. AFFECTING OUR STATE CHANGING THE VOTING THRESHOLD STANDARD FOR VOTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ONE IN WHICH THEY ARE EMPOWERED TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS. ON LOCAL MATTERS A CA ONE IS SIMPLY GIVING A CALIFORNIA VOTERS ANOTHER TOOL ONE THAT IS MORE FAIR ONE THAT IS MORE DEMOCRATIC TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND PUBLIC IN TRUCKS ACCEPTS BACK FULLY ASKED WE AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BONTA MISTER GLORIA YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE A PROUD CO AUTHOR TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM WINTERS ON SUPPORT OF A CA ONE MEMBERS ALL OF US CAME TO OFFICE MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS CALLING UPON US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT OUR STATE TERRIFIC HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND DEMANDING THAT WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE DESPITE SOME OF THE MANY HER ROGUE EFFORTS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE VOTERS HAVE DONE. STILL IS INADEQUATE FOR THE SIZE THE NEED OF THE GROWTH THAT WE EXPERIENCING HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACA ONE ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH THAT WOULD RUN. WE'RE GOING TO DIFFERENT ROCK A ROUTE WHERE THERE'S A CALIFORNIA THAT WORKS REALLY FOR ALL OF US ALLOWS MORE PEOPLE TO ENVISION A FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY AFFORD TO LIVE HERE AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE ACTUALLY DIRECTLY INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE I'VE HEARD WITH RESPECT POLICIES RATE THE ISSUE OF THE FIRST TIME HOME BUYER. WELL AS I UNDERSTAND FROM READING OF THE PRESS THE ONLY ONE ON THE SCHOOL AS AN ART FORM. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE SOCIALIZED COSTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE WE BOUGHT ME WHAT FROM EIGHT TO PUT. OTHER NAY. PILE NO NO IT'S. LONG AGO. THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THIS CRISIS IS WE WORK ON THIS ALL COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER. AND UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU KNOW THE BAR RIGHT NOW IS TOO HIGH. THE BAR WAS SET WHERE IT WAS SET NOT TO ACTUALLY FACILITATE THIS BUT SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE IT. A CREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY GET THE FOR PROGRESS THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS EXPECT FOR US. THEY DEMAND FROM US ON ABOUT YOU I HAVE TOWN HALL MEETINGS PEOPLE TALK TO ME ALL THE TIME WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY WHEN YOU GONNA FIX THE HIGHWAY WHEN YOU GET A PAVE THE ROAD. WENT AGAIN TO FIRE STATION IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I RECOGNIZE IT IF WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS ON THE BALLOT. IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. YOU ALL MANY OF YOU COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED THIS YOURSELF. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN I WORK TOGETHER WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS BIS IN LETZTER TRANSPORTATION ADVOCATES BARTON WAS TO PUT TOGETHER COMPREHENSIVE. MEASURE SAN DIEGO CAN. AFFECT THE THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHO COSTS INYO COUNTY HOME DESPITE THAT I'M PRESIDENT COALITION WE GOT 58% OF THE VOTE BUT AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT. IS NOT ENOUGH. THE PROGRESS THAT WE NEED TO SEE AND CHANGED OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM PRESERVING OUR OPEN SPACE AND INVESTING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IT'S STOCKS. BECAUSE A MINORITY OF PEOPLE SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO. MEMBERS SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN DONALD TRUMP CAN BECOME PRESENT NOT IT STATES WITH 46% OF THE POPULAR VOTE AND YET CALIFORNIA COULD NOT INVEST IN ITS NEIGHBORHOODS EVEN WHEN FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT. OF ITS RESIDENTS AGREE. LET'S DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THIS YOUR VOTE TODAY IS NOT DETERMINATIVE YOU WELL KNOW THAT THIS IS ABOUT GIVING THE PUBLIC THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON THIS MATTER. AND IF I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO MY CONSTITUENTS I KNOW THAT THEY WANT ME TO VOTE YES AND I WILL BE DOING THAT TODAY I WANT IT'S CLOSE BY GETTING MY EXTREME RESPECT. TO THE MEMBER FROM WINTERS THIS IS NOT AN EASY CONVERSATION BUT IT'S ONE THAT HAS BEEN. IGNORED FOR TOO LONG AND IT IS TIME THAT THIS LEGISLATION DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT GIVE THE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. VOTE YES ON A CA ONE. THANK WAS GLORIA DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I RICE IS A CO AUTHOR OF A CA ONE AND THANK THE AUTHOR VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'LL JUST MAKE ONE POINT IT'S BEEN SAID THAT 80% OF THE BOND ISSUES THAT HAVE TWO THIRDS DO PASS THAT YOU'RE SHOWS THAT YOU DON'T PUT A BOND ISSUE UP. IF YOU HAVE 58% APPROVAL. THERE MAY COUNTIES WHICH CAN'T DO THAT A LOT OF CONNIE'S TRIED FOREVER. TO GET TO DO WHAT MOST MANY COUNTIES HAVE DONE. UP WHICH IS TO HAVE A SELFIE A SELF HELP COUNTY IN TERMS OF GETTING UP ROADS DONE THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PASS THEY JUST. FOREVER REASON CAN'T REACH TWO THIRDS I THINK 55% IS ENOUGH THANK YOU. DATA CORPORATION IS AREA YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND I JUST WANTED TO. MAKE A BRIEF A NOTATION OF A COUPLE OF POINTS ONE IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE WE CONFUSE OUR COMMITMENT TO KEEPING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SAFE WITH BEING FINANCIALLY PRUDENT WHICH I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU SERVE ON A COMMITTEE SUCH AS THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD AND SEE TO WHAT EXTENT WE- SERVE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND SOME OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TO ALL TOO WELL THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH. UP WITH THE BODIES ALLOCATE FUND NECESSARY FUNDING TO THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN DISTRICTS WHERE BOND AFTER BOND HAS FAILED. THAT'S WHY I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF SELF HELP HERE. BOND AFTER BOND HAS FAILED. AND THAT'S WHY THE RELY UPON THIS STATE TO COME IN AND GIVE THEM THE ENTIRETY OF THE WITH THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS INSTEAD OF JUST A FIFTY PERCENT. BECAUSE OF THE 50% LOCAL AND STATE MATCH. YET WE STAND HERE AND WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD BE FISCALLY PRUDENT. THE THIS IS A ZERO SUM GAME. IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE PAID FOR FROM THE STATE. FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF WE CAN GET SOME ACTION AND SUPPORT OR IT'S GONNA COME FROM MORE VOTERS BUT WE CAN'T GO BACK AND CAMPAIGN AGAINST MEASURES. DEFEAT THEM AND THEN COME BACK IN BACK CHANNEL WE ASK FOR MORE FUNDING FROM THE STATE. AND MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT THE ENTIRE STATE HAS THE CONSTITUENT RESIDENTS IN THE STATE HAVE TO PAY FOR WHEN PART OF THAT OBLIGATION IS INCUMBENT ON OUR LOCAL RESIDENTS TO PAY FOR. JUSTIN LA I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT OF SOME YEARS AGO OF THE FOUR YEARS AGO WE HAD A TRANSPORTATION MAJOR TRANSPORTATION BALLOT WHICH FAILED BY. THREE POINT 3% POINTS. AND WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE COST ALL OVER AGAIN TO PLACE IT BACK AND GET IT PASSED THE SECOND TIME AND THAT WAS LA WHICH PROBABLY HAS THE HIGHEST OBLIGATION WHEN IT COMES THE BOND DEBT SO WITH THAT I ADAMANTLY SUPPORT AND VIGOROUSLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THERE SEEMS TO BE A GREAT MYSTERY TODAY AS TO WHY WE CAN'T GET SOME OF THESE BOND MEASURES PASSED WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE SO LET ME HELP SOLVE IT FOR YOU IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD IT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT IT. IF YOU CAN'T GET THE THRESHOLD THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SET. BY LAW THAT MEANS PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO. YOU MIGHT WANT IT BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY PAY THE BILL DON'T. PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE PAYING THAT BILL FOR TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS DON'T WANT THAT INVOICE. THERE'S NO REASON TO CHANGE IT I THINK THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN IF SOME OF THESE BOND MEASURES HAVE FAILED THAT'S WERE GOOD REASON BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BUY WHAT YOU'RE SELLING. I REGION ABOUT. ALL DEBATE AND DISCUSSION HAVING SEIZED ON THE ITEM. MS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU MAY CLOSE. WELL I TAKE A LITTLE EXCEPTION TO A FEW THINGS BUT I WILL SAY IS THAT YES FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US WHEN FIRST BY YOUR FIRST HOME. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. MY COMMUNITY AND I LOOK AROUND. AND THEY ARE SAYING TO ME THE SENIORS NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I NEED MY SENIOR SOMEWHERE. IF YOU'RE SENIOR IS THE SUM IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT OPENS UP SOME OF THE INVENTORY YOUR COMMUNITY. AND I THINK WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP SOME OF OUR SENIORS BE ABLE TO GO TO OTHER PLACES TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD A PLACE AS THEY AGE ON. I THINK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE SIT HERE NUMEROUS TIMES HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE I HAVE. BEEN ASKED TO VOTE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE CLEAN WATER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS. THIS IS A WAY TO HELP YOUR COMMUNITIES DO SO. YOU KNOW THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD BROUGHT UP BROADBAND. MY COMMUNITIES FIGHT FOR BROADBAND MY COMMUNITIES CAN EVEN GET HEALTH CARE ACCESS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IF I TELL HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC PROJECT. THIS FUNDING TO GO THROUGH THEY DO IT. YOU KNOW. ASSEMBLY ROOM MELINDA'S YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE VOTES GO THEY ASSUME THAT EVERYTHING IS A 55% OR 50% MOST PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT'S A TWO THIRDS THEY JUST DON'T. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU TELL ME THEY DON'T. YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A TAX THIS IS SIMPLY ASKING YOUR CONSTITUENTS IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A SPECIFIC PROJECT. IN THEIR COMMUNITY THAT THEY WANT TO BUILT. REFER REFURBISH THAT'S ALL IT DOES THIS IS ALL THIS IS JUST ASKING GIVING PERMISSION TO CITIES TO RUN THESE OF ALL THE IS GUYS I'M NOT ASKING FOR A TAX. I'M NOT YOUR COMMUNITIES MAKE THIS AND MAKE THIS DECISION ON THEIR OWN. YOU KNOW THIS TAKES COURAGE EVERYONE. BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MUCH OF IT HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE COURAGE TODAY THIS IS NOT A TAX I'M ASKING YOU TO STAND UP FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR PEOPLE BY PROVIDING THEM THE POWER TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THEIR OWN. BACK YARD. WE CAN'T DO IT ALL FOR WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT LET THEM AND LET THEM MAKE UP SOME OF THIS MONEY WHY CAN'T THEY LEVERAGE SOME OF THEIR MONEY FOR FEDERAL MONEY WHEN IT COMES FOR OPEN. WHY CAN'T WE LET THEM DO THAT. THEY ARE THE ONES ARE CONSTITUENTS KNOW WHAT PROJECTS MATTER TO THEM. THEY KNOW WHAT'S MANAGED TO THEIR CHILDREN THEY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO THEIR FAMILIES. OUR COMMUNITY SUFFER FROM CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. FAILING WATER SYSTEMS AFTERMATH OF NATURAL DISASTERS SEA LEVEL RISE RUN DOWN POLICE AND FIRE STATIONS. LACKS THE PARKS AND RECREATION.

SENATE BILL FOR NINETEEN STILL PRESERVES THE RIGHT FOR TEACHERS TO REMOVE A STUDENT FROM A CLASSROOM FOR DESTRUCTION INDOOR DEFIANCE IT SIMPLY MEANS THEY WILL NOT BE REMOVED FROM THE SCHOOL.

THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA MISTER CHOI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. MADAM SPEAKER AND THE MEMBERS SAW I RISE. IN OPPOSITION TO AS BL FOUR NINETEEN. COLLEAGUES SO I STAND UP TO A POST THIS BILL BECAUSE THAT'S ALL PASSED GOVERNOR BROWN THE STADIA. TEACHERS AND THE PRINCIPALS SAW ON THE FRONTLINE IS EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN AND THE ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS. ABOUT THE ORDER AND THAT THIS BELOW NOT IN THE CLASSROOMS. OUR LAWS ARE CURRENTLY RESTRICT OUT THE USE OF A SUSPENSION OF BY REQUIRING THAT. IT ONLY BE USED OVER AND OTHER MEANS OF A CORRECTION FAIL. WE MUST LOOK TO ENFORCING THE CAR IN LOSS IF THEY ARE BEING IGNORED AND THE FOCUS ON THE OVERALL ENVIRONMENT OF THE CLASSROOM BEFORE JUMPING OUT TO A NEW LAW SO AND THE REGULATIONS. AS AN EDUCATOR MYSELF LÃ  I BELIEVE THAT THE WE NEED TO A PLACE SO MORE TRUST IN OUR EDUCATORS AND TO GIVE THEM THE FLEXIBILITY. TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE OUR CHILDREN FOR THE FUTURE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK VIDEO NO VOTE THANK YOU. YOU MISTER TRY SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE. THERE MIGHT WEBER. DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR NINETEEN MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED I THINK WITH A LOT OF THINGS AND SPECIALLY THOSE WHO WORK THE BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR PROGRAM NO. THAT COULD EASILY BE APPLIED IN AREAS WHERE THE NECESSARY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY WE TALK ABOUT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS WE'VE HAD PEOPLE WHO TRY TO SUSPEND KINDERGARTNERS AND FIRST GRADERS FOR THEIR PERSPECTIVE THIS AT SOME ON THE WRONG PATH. AND WE NEED TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR THAT THEY'RE IN THE SCHOOLS THAT THE TIME IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE WHEN YOU START TO SPENDING A CHAU YOU REALLY ARE PUTTING THEM ON THE PATH FOR DROPOUTS AND BEING OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM EVERY KID NEEDS TO BE IN A SCHOOL WHERE THEY ARE LOVED CARED FOR AND THAT. WE HAVE THE- ENVIRONMENT IT'S BASICALLY STAYING. I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I SAW SO OFTEN IN MY SCHOOLS. I HAVE A COUNCIL WANTS TO SAYS PLEASE. OUR SCHOOL EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SCHOOL STARTS AT EIGHT. SHE WANTED ME TO COME. SO I WENT TO HERS. BOB WENT TO THE SCHOOL AND WENT TO THE- THE LIBRARY WHERE HER CONFERENCE. ROOM WAS A COUNSELOR. AND PROBABLY THE BELL RANG EIGHT. BY EIGHT TEN THE ROOM WAS FULL. FOR WHAT KIDS OF PEOPLE DID ONE DEAL WITH. THEY'VE SOLD AS A CHILD WALKING SAVE ARE YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD DAY I'M GOING TO BE PROBLEMS TOO AGAIN DAY AND KEEP THE PRICE SO YOU'LL PROBABLY BE A PROBLEM AND SO THEY WOULD SEND THEM OUT WITH A PACKET OF MATERIAL AND SO SHE HAD. STUDENTS ARE. IN FULL BECAUSE THEY COULD BASICALLY. PUT CHILDREN OUT OF CLASS. AT THEY COULD ALSO SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL FOR THAT. WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT ALL THE RESEARCH SAYS VERY CLEARLY. THE STUDENTS WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE CLASSROOM DURING THE DAY. DO NOT DO BETTER THEY DO WORSE. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DROP OUTS AND OTHER THINGS AND KIDS BEING BEHIND WE HAVE AN ACADEMIC ISSUE OF. A PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF KIDS WILL POUR. AND THIS IS OFTEN DONE. TO KIDS OF COLOR. AND WE SAW THESE WE SEE THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN WILL PEOPLE MISINTERPRET THE ADDED TO THEIR PERSPECTIVE.
