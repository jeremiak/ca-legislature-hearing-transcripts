GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT AB EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN A BILL THAT WILL FUND. ARTICLE IN EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS TO OUR HOMELESS PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU'VE HEARD MANY TIMES TO THE C. CALIFORNIA HAS A SERIOUS HOMELESS PROBLEM. AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA AN ESTIMATED OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN DAY. AS REPORTED BY HOOD. OF THAT TOTAL EIGHT THOUSAND AND THIRTY MORE FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND VETERANS. TWELVE THOUSAND WERE UNACCOMPANIED YOUNG ADULTS. AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST FEEDERS TO HOMELESSNESS IS OUR SYSTEMS OF MASS INCARCERATION IN FACT IT HAS BECOME SUCH A FEEDER INTO HOMELESSNESS. THE CDC ARE ESTIMATED ABOUT 20% OF ALL PEOPLE LEAVING PRISONS WILL LEAVE ONLY TO BECOME HOMELESS. THEY ALSO HAVE ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT A THIRD TO HALF OF THE PEOPLE ON PAROLE LIVING LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCISCO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. RIGHT NOW 70% OF THE PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS HAVE AT ONE POINT BEEN INCARCERATED IN THE REASON IS BECAUSE- WHEN YOU CONTACT THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS INCREASES IN WHEN YOU HAVE. BECOME ONE HOUSE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CONTACTING THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM INCREASES WELL IN LOS ANGELES OVER FOUR YEAR PERIOD ONE AND FIVE ARRESTS WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS EXPERIENCING. HOMELESSNESS THIS LINKAGE BETWEEN OUR SYSTEMS OF MASS INCARCERATION. AND OUR SYSTEMS OF HOUSING IN EQUITY. OUR EXACERBATING ONE ANOTHER. FOR THAT REASON WE BELIEVE THAT POLICY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON CREATED PERMANENT HOUSING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE EXITING PRESIDENT. CURRENTLY CCR FUNDS PROGRAMS THAT PLACE PEOPLE IN TEMPORARY HOUSING FOR SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS. WHAT AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY WILL CREATE IS A REENTRY HOUSING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM TO DO FOR ADDITIONAL THINGS. ONE OFFER PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH RECENT PRISON STAYS AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. TO PROVIDE TENANTS WITH SERVICES TO HELP STABILIZE THE NEXUS WHATEVER TREATMENT THEY MAY NEED THREE READY TENANTS FOR THE WAGE JOBS TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT SO TEND TO AVENGE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER THEIR OWN RENTED FOR EVALUATE THE OUTCOMES. SO WE KNOW WHAT IS WORKING AND HOW WE CAN MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THIS MODEL IS NOT NEW SUPPORTIVE PERMANENT HOUSING PROGRAMS HAVE POPPED UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WITH. SURPRISING AN OPTIMISTIC AND HOPEFUL RESULTS FOR EXAMPLE THE RETURNING HOME. OHIO PROGRAM IN IN NEW YORK A RECORD ISLAND PROGRAM BOTH SHOWED. A TREMENDOUS RESULTS WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE HOUSING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ALSO THIS BILL IS NOT NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE. IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM IT WAS AUTHORED BY WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU- IN HIS ABSENCE OF THAT HAS NOT ELIMINATED THE PROBLEM AND THAT WE FELT COMPELLED TO BRING IT BACK AGAIN. WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE TWO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT ONE IS SCHON HEUTE THE INTER BOARD CHAIR FOR THE REENTRY PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPOT. AND BECKY GESTEDE THE REENTRY PROGRAM MANAGER FOR PATH. PEOPLE ASSISTING THE HOMELESS. FRANK IF TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU TO CHAIR WICKS VICE CHAIR SEYARTO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS BECKY JESTER AND I'M THE RE ENTRY PROGRAM MANAGER FOR PATH IN SAN DIEGO I'M ON THE GROUND EVERY DAY RUNNING EXACTLY THE KIND OF PROGRAM AB EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN WOULD FIND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO EXCITED TO CO SPONSOR THE BELL AND GRATEFUL TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY OUR PROGRAM IN SAN DIEGO WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH BOTH THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE THROUGH THE COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESAGENCY OUR PROGRAM SUCCEEDS BECAUSE EVERY STAKEHOLDER INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT WANTS TO STOP THE PRISON TO STREETS PIPELINE AS A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WE CAN STAY WITH SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT'S TRUE EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA IN OUR PROGRAM COUNTY STAFFER FOR INDIVIDUALS TO PASS THROUGHOUT RISK OF EXITING. INCARCERATION INTO HOMELESSNESS WELL AHEAD OF THEIR RELEASE STATES THAT OUR STAFF HAS THE TIME TO BUILD REPORT NECESSARY TO BE THERE FOR THEM AS SOON AS THEY'RE RELEASED. SINCE WE BEGAN IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE'VE HELPED OVER A HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY STAY IN A SAFE PLACE AFTER THEIR RELEASE. RECEIVE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES LIKE MENTAL HEALTH OR ADDICTION SUPPORT AND OBTAIN PERMANENT HOUSING. SO FAR NEARLY HALF OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE ALREADY SUSTAINING THEMSELVES IN PERMANENT HOUSING WITHOUT FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OUR PROGRAM. AND ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF OUR RECIPIENTS HAVEN'T BEEN BOOKED INTO JAIL FOR ANY REASON SINCE THEIR ENROLLMENT. OUR CLIENTS ARE GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED IN A WAY THAT SAFER FOR THEM. AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY THAN CARBURETION. BUT THE COUNTY'S OWN ESTIMATE OUR PROGRAM IS MORE THAN 20% CHEAPER THAN IT WOULD HAVE COST TO RE ARREST AND INCARCERATE OUR PARTICIPANTS. REENTRY PROGRAMS DON'T JUST LOWER THE HUMAN COST OF INCARCERATION BUT THE FINANCIAL COST AS WELL. WE CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT AB EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN WILL HELP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS GET THE HELP THEY NEED. TO MAKE GOOD ON A SECOND CHANCE WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN IT'S HARD WORK ON THIS BILL IN RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR A YES VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT ONE IS HI MY NAME IS JONATHAN THE INTERIM BOARD CHAIRMAN THREE THREE PRIVADAS ASSOCIATION. STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION THAT SUPPORTS ADVOCATE AND AN IPHONE SECTION. THAT WORK WITH RETIREMENT SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT. THEIR SUCCESS. AND WE- ALSO SOME WITHIN THE EXPERIENCE I'M A GRANDMA BUT WITHIN THE OF MEN RETURNING OUR COMMUNITIES WITH UNSTABLE HOUSING AND LIVING WITH THE REST OF HOMES WITHOUT PERMITTED. SUPPORT EVERYDAY CAL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON NO PLACE TO LIVE WITH AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY THOUSAND EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED AND OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THIS PRESENTS A HOMELESSNESS PIPELINE. JEOPARDIZED OWN STABILITY HELLO SAFELY AND WILL BE AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITIES. A SHORT PEOPLE HAVE STABLE AND SECURE HOUSING TO RETURN HOME TO IS KEY TO OUR SUCCESSFUL REENTRY AND REINTEGRATION. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO POSITION FOR MANY CARS READY COMMUTING THEN ALSO FAILED. INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING THEIR SUCCESS WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ON PAROLE ARE SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE A VACATION HOMELESS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT FORMERLY INCARCERATED. TWENTY SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE UNSTABLE HOUSE OR HOMELESS THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IN FACT CALIFORNIA DALLAS DATA HAS ESTIMATED THAT ONE THIRD TO ONE HALF OF ALL PEOPLE ON PAROLE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS AT ANY POINT. WE ALSO KNOW THE EVIDENCE BASED HOUSING DECREASES RECIDIVISM RATES BY 60% WE COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUPS AND REDUCES ARRESTS BY 40% AB EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN SUPPORTS THE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY AND REINTEGRATION OF FORMER INCARCERATED COMMUNITY MEMBERS BY PROVIDING PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS AND SUPPORTS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING THAT PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR PARTICIPANTS TO EXCESS LIVABLE WAGE JOBS. NOT LONG AGO I WAS IN A TRANSITIONAL HOME. I RECEIVED A CALL ON THE TUESDAY THAT TOLD ME MY FUNDING WOULD BE OVER ON FRIDAY. THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT GIVEN TO ME. THANKFULLY BY THE GRACE OF GOD I HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS ABLE. TO ALLOW ME TO STAY WITH HIM.

THANK YOU I'M WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR- BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD OBVIOUSLY- VERY CHALLENGING- BUT IMPORTANT TO WORK ON- THE SUBPOPULATION THAT YOU'RE TARGETING HERE- CRITICAL THAT WE PROVIDE THIS HOUSING ANY SERVICES I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE USING AND FOCUSING ON HOUSING FIRST MODELS THAT WE KNOW WORK- AND- I WOULD JUST. RECOMMEND GOING FOR HAPPY TO MAKE A- MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL- I'M ALWAYS INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT WOULD BE I KNOW THIS IS NOT A FUNDING BILL- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY. IF WE HAVE THIS GRANT PROGRAM AND IF WE'RE ABLE TO DO WE KNOW CERTAIN X. MILLION DOLLARS WE CAN HELP THIS NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. IN A BENCHMARK THAT AGAINST YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT THE POPULATION IS OUT THERE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO SERVE. AND ALSO- IT NEVER NEVER SKIP A MOMENT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT- THE COST SAVINGS THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULD BE SPENDING ANYWAY- I. ALMOST ARE ABLE TO PAY FOR THESE IF WE CAN JUST REALLY SEE THAT MONEY AND GET THESE PROGRAMS UP AND RUNNING SO THANK YOU FOR READING THIS BILL I THINK IT'S GOING TO DO A LOT OF GOOD. HAPPY TO SUPPORT CAME. I THINK MANAGER AND THANK YOU SUMMER BRIAN FOR BRING THIS FOR OUR PROJECT AND AUTHOR. OF THIS BILL AND THE YEARS THAT I WORKED AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER- AND AS MANY PEOPLE KNOW PUBLIC DEFENDERS YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE THERE TO. TO REPRESENT. THEIR CLIENTS AND IN THE COURT BUT- WE ALSO IN MANY WAYS SOCIAL WORKERS IN TERMS OF. TRYING TO HELP OUR CLIENTS. GET BACK UP ON THEIR FEET AND THE REALITY IS THAT. HOUSING EVEN BACK THEN WAS WAS ALWAYS THEM. THE MAIN ISSUE AND STRUGGLE- THAT THAT SO MANY OF OUR CLIENTS WITH. WOULD SUFFER THROUGH- THAT WOULD CAUSE THEM. TO BE SUBJECT TO PROBATION VIOLATIONS OR- OTHER. PUNITIVE MEASURES- BUT WE'RE REALLY JUST. IT JUST A CONSEQUENCE OF POVERTY IN NOT. HAVING THE SUPPORT NECESSARY- WE ARE IN A BETTER PLACE NOW I THINK WE'RE GOING IN THE BETTER DIRECTION. OF THANKS TO LEGISLATION SUGGESTED LIKE THIS- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND I THINK ESPECIALLY IN. WITH COVE AND- IT'S EXACERBATED. THE ISSUE- JUST LAST YEAR I WAS OUTSIDE THE JAIL IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WITH THE- A TABLE SET UP ON THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS THERE BECAUSE- WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE THIS SET UP- THEY WERE JUST PAYS ANYONE DOES GET RELEASED AND YOU HAVE HOUSING. YOU KNOW THE- WITH WITH THE BUDGET BETTER SOMETHING IDEA BUT WE'RE OUT THERE. JUSTIN WHAT CAN WE DO IN THIS URGENT SITUATION TO. TRY TO FIND A ROOF OVER THIS PERSON'S HEAD BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. THEY THEY THEY WERE. CLOSER TO GET RELEASED. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE LEFT IN MANY WAYS TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES AND GET EXPECTED TO DO SO MANY THINGS- L. AS A CONDITION OF THEIR PAROLE OR PROBATION. AND YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE ALL TO ME NOT ONLY IS THAT GOOD FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES- IT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US IS GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AS GOOD. AS SOME AWARD INDICATED. OF IN TERMS OF COSTS. IT COSTS A LOT LESS- TO GET AHEAD OF THIS AND OFFER THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. THOSE WHO TO FOLLOW THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL WHICH WORKS. IN SO MANY APPLICATIONS AND IT CERTAINLY WORKS. FOR THOSE ARE INCARCERATED SO- I'M VERY GRATEFUL. THAT THAT YOU'RE BRINGING THE SPORT INTO THE NUMBER OF ORGAN. SHINS AND ALL THE FOLKS A CALL IN. IN SUPPORT BECAUSE REALITY THAT JUST THIS BILL THROUGH- IS JUST. BY IT IS IT'S REALLY REALLY IT'S A IT'S A SIGNAL. TO THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY OKAY. ONCE WE GET THIS THROUGH WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT FOR FUNDING- I WOULD ARGUE THAT YEAH IT'S GREAT TO GIVE. MONEY IN REGARDS TO INCREASE GASKELL GAS PRICES I THINK THAT. PRETTY MONEY TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS- IS EQUALLY IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WERE. ACTUALLY SOLVING PROBLEMS THAT- I HAD REALLY. BEEN WITH US FOR DECADES- BUT WE HAVE A PATH OUT THANKS TO THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU SIR BRENT. ANYONE ELSE OUT MISTER SADDAM. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ONE OF THEM IS HOW DO YOU PREVENT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS FROM. OVERWHELMING ITSELF IN OTHER WORDS IT'S MEANT TO HAVE IT'S MEANT TO BE TAILORED AROUND PEOPLE THAT ARE IN NEED OF HOUSING AFTERWARDS HOW DO YOU WEED OUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN NEED VERSUS THE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T BATES DECIDE HEY YOU KNOW WHAT IF I CAN GET TWO YEARS OF FREE HOUSING. I'M GONNA BE IN NEED AND THAT HE HAS A TENDENCY TO DO WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE WITH THAT ARE TAILORED TO HELP PEOPLE IS IT OVERWHELMS THE PROGRAM SO HOW DO WE DIFFERENTIATE THOSE THAT ARE IN NEED VERSUS THOSE THAT ARE NOT. YES I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- IT AND I THINK THE GOOD NEWS FOR US IS WE'RE TARGETING A POPULATION THAT IS OVERWHELMINGLY AND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY AND MEET A COMING HOME FROM CAR SERRATION IN THE LA TIMES OF SUPPORT EDITORIAL WITH A HE JUST THIS QUESTION WE GIVE PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS OF GATE MONEY AND WE SAY GOOD LUCK- MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED HAD. A HOUSING AND SECURITY PRIOR TO INCARCERATION AT FOOD INSECURITY HAD A LIMITED ECONOMIC MOBILITY- FROM COMMUNITIES THAT THEY CAME FROM AND THOSE WERE ONLY EXACERBATED BY THE TIME THE STATE PRISON THESE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND ARE COMING HOME TO VIRTUALLY NOTHING. AND AS A RESULT DISPROPORTIONATE FALL INTO OUR HOMELESS POPULATION SO I'M NOT A CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT THIS PROGRAM BEING ABUSED BY FOLKS WHO ARE INCARCERATED FOR YEARS TO ACTUALLY HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO COME HOME TO I THINK A BY TARGETING THIS POPULATION IN LIFTING FROM THE BOTTOM- YOU WEED OUT PEOPLE WHO MIGHT. OTHERWISE NOT BE THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND ONE OF THE- CONCERNS I HAVE ABOUT OUR APPROACH I MEAN THERE'S DEFINITELY A SPACE FOR THE- APPROACH ON THAT SIDE WHEN THEY GET OUT. BUT WE DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON LOOKING AT THE INCARCERATION SYSTEM ITSELF AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE TIME THAT PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THEY DO COME OUT. THEY ARE DRUG FREE THEY HAVE BEEN REHABILITATED IT FOR INACTIVE FOR LENGTH OF TIME THAT WILL TRULY MAKE A DIFFERENCE- THIRTY DAYS DOES NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE THIRTY DAYS IS THIRTY DAYS OF DRY AND THEN GET OUT AND FIND. WHAT YOU WERE DOING BEFORE AND THEN THEY GO RIGHT BACK TO IT- IF WE'RE SPENDING ALL OUR MONEY ON THIS SIDE AND NOT SPENDING ANY MONEY ON THE OTHER SIDE TO REFORM THAT PART OF IT SO THAT PEOPLE THAT CAN BE REHABILITATED TRULY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE REHABILITATED CAN BE DRUG FREE AND THEY CAN HAVE A PIPELINE INTO THE MILLIONS OF JOBS THAT ARE OUT THERE THEIR ON FIELD. THAT WILL HELP SUPPORT THEM IN A LESS TIME THAN WORKERS SAYING THAT THIS THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM WOULD DO. SO I'D LIKE TO SEE IF A EIGHT A MORE BALANCED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. AND TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE BEFORE THEY GET OUT WHILE THEY'RE DOING THEIR TIME WHILE THEY'RE SERVING THEIR TIME. SO THAT WHEN THEY COME OUT WE DON'T GET STE WE WERE NOT IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY NEED DRUG COUNSELING. MARK AND ALL THESE AND JOB TRAINING THEY SHOULD ALREADY HAVE THAT DONE AND IF WE'RE NOT DOING THAT THAT'S OUR FAILURE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS IT FOR ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE AN IMPACT. ON THESE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE'RE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO FIND ENOUGH HOUSING. FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION IS OUT THERE. AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE ON A- VOLUNTARY BASIS WILL NOT COME IN. FOR DRUG TREATMENT. MADE THEY SIMPLY WILL GO BACK TO BEING HOMELESS INSTEAD OF NOT TAKING. YOU KNOW TO NOT HAVING THEIR DRUGS. SO I HAVE A LOT AND I MEAN THIS IS A VERY VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE. AND AND SO I JUST HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. MORE MORE PROGRAMS TO TRY TO DO. WORK ON ONE SIDE WITHOUT TRYING TO FIX THE OTHER SIDE- SO ANYWAY I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL IN THERE THE ATTEMPTS THAT YOU'RE MAKING TO TRY TO. ADDRESS THE AT LEAST THE ONE SIDE NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND THERE IS AN IN REACH COMPONENT TO OUR BILL TO START LOOKING FOR SOME THESE HOUSING MY FOLKS ARE STILL. INCARCERATED IN AND WERE IN FULL AGREEMENT THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE BEFORE AND I WOULD ARGUE THERE'S EVEN A THIRD SIDE. AND THAT'S PRIOR TO FOLKS EVER BEING INCARCERATED TO BEGIN WITH RIGHT THERE'S A LOT WE HAVE TO DO TO BUILD UP OUR SOCIAL. AND PUBLIC AND CIVIC INFRASTRUCTURES THAT PEOPLE DON'T FALL INTO THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AT ALL- INCLUDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT HOUSING- IN OTHER STRUCTURES AND SO THAT'S. DEVON SOMETHING I'D LOVE TO WORK ON TOGETHER- IN THE LAW RUN- THANK YOU. I MISSED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANNA COME IN MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES- FROM MURRIETA WHO'S ADVOCATING FOR MORE FUNDING FOR REHABILITATION WITHIN CDC ARE I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- WHICH SHOWS THE BIPARTISAN NEED AND NECESSITY TO ENSURE THAT LEGISLATION AND BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AND ENSURING THAT PEOPLE COMING OUT. OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM OR A SOFT AND SAY OUR INJUSTICE SYSTEM UP TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED- MY DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GENTRIFYING DISTRICTS WITHIN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND WITHIN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HISTORIC COMMUNITIES. MANY OF WHOM- MY FRIENDS FROM HIGH SCHOOL HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE PRISON SYSTEM THEMSELVES IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM HIMSELF COMING BACK OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND NOT ABLE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE THERE WHICH ONLY CREATES MORE ENCAMPMENTS AND LESS OPPORTUNITIES AND SO I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH A BUDGET AND THIS PAST YEAR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES WHICH IS A WORLDWIDE RECOGNIZED ORGANIZATION THAT DOES. EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF WORK AS WELL AS AN ORGANIZATION CALLED CROP WHICH IS CREATING RESTORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES AND PROGRAMS WHICH DOES EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOREIGN A AND YOUR ADVOCATING A MUCH LARGER SCALE SO I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO IT MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AS WELL AS GETTING AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN THE BUDGET. TO INSURE THAT WE MOVE THIS FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I ALSO WANT TO- REALLY THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING ON THE MANTLE OF ARE THE PREVIOUS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE MR CHIU WHO WE MISS. TERRIBLY AND ON THE IN THIS BODY- AND JUST YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND YOUR TIRELESS ADVOCACY IT'S CRITICAL I THINK THIS IS A PERFECTLY TAILORED PROGRAM TO HELP IT CONSTITUENCIES PEOPLE WHO. WE KNOW NEED THE HELP AND THIS IS WHAT GOVERNMENT IS FOR IS TO DO EXACTLY JUST THAT SO. I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR- AND I KNOW WE HAVE- A MOTION AND A SECOND- BEFORE WE CALL THE ROLL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THAT THANK YOU WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AS A CO AUTHOR AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS QUESTIONS CONCERNS AND TO THE WITNESSES TESTIFYING TODAY. WE DO A LOT TO TRY TO GET FOLKS OFF THE STREETS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE TO DO MORE- BEFORE WE HAVE WE GET OFF THERE'S A HANDFUL THAT FALLS INTO IT. AND PART OF THE HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN SOCIETY INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT HAVE PAID THEIR- THEIR DEBTS TO SOCIETY. AND WHAT THIS PROGRAM IS LOOKING TO DO IS. IS TO ALLEVIATE THAT ALLEVIATE WITH HOUSING AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IMMOBILITY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

NUMBER OF ISSUES BOTH FACTUAL AND LEGAL AND STRAW IN STRONG FAVOR OF THIS BILLS REJECTION. SINGLING OUT CALIFORNIA'S PUBLICLY OWNED GOLF COURSES FOR SUBSIDIZED DEVELOPMENT RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT SETTLED CALIFORNIA LAW. DEPLETES GREEN SPACE IN PRECISELY THOSE COMMUNITIES ALREADY DEEMED PARK POOR EXCOMMUNICATED OFF FROM THE PARK AND RECREATION FAMILY FOR WHICH IT HAS BEEN A PART OF FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS. PROMISES CAN'T HOUSING AT A VERY HIGH COST AND DOES ALL OF THIS PURPOSES ABOUT PUBLIC GOLF IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE FALSE. GOLF COURSES PROVIDER PRESERVE OPEN SPACE SEQUESTER CARBON PROVIDE ALLOW RAIN WATER TO GET INTO THE GROUND WHERE. GROUNDWATER BASINS AND IN TIMES OF GLOBAL WARMING AND RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES GOLF COURSES REDUCE TEMPERATURES IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS. PUBLICLY ON GOLF COURSES PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS ALMOST ENTIRELY IN DENSELY PACKED URBAN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THEY ARE MOST NEEDED. CONVERTING THEM TO HARDSCAPE EXACERBATE EXACERBATES BOTH PROBLEMS. AB NINETEEN TEN BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERABLY MORE HARM THAN ANY POSSIBLE HOUSING GOOD. THAT MIGHT COME FROM IT.

AB NINETEEN TEN SINGLES OUT GOLF AMONG ALL OTHER PARK FUNCTIONS IN CALIFORNIA FOR CONVERSION TO HOUSING YES MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSES ARE PARKS AT LEAST SO SAY CALIFORNIA'S COURTS. AND IT SINGLES GOLF OUT PROCLAIMS THE GAME IS IN DECLINE MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSES ARE SUBSIDIZED AND ITS USERS ARE SOMEHOW NOT THE SAME PERSONS WHO USE THE STATE'S OTHER PARK LAND AMENITIES. THE NATIONAL GOLF FOUNDATION WHICH IS FILED A SEPARATE LETTER IN OPPOSITION TO AB NINETEEN TEN. REPORTS THE FOLLOWING MORE ROUNDS OF GOLF OR PLAYED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAN ANY OTHER YEAR IN AMERICAN HISTORY. OVER THREE MILLION PEOPLE TOOK UP THE SPORT FOR THE FIRST TIME. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. 37% OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE FEMALE. AND 31% PERSONS OF COLOR. 70% OF CALIFORNIA'S GOLF COURSES ARE PUBLIC 22% OF THEM OWNED BY LOCAL AGENCIES AND MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THOSE WHO PLAY GOLF IN CALIFORNIA HAVE MEDIAN INCOMES BELOW THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE. WITH RESPECT TO SUBSIDIES IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND. MUNICIPAL GOLF PROGRAM SUBSIDIZED URBAN PARK BUDGETS TO THE TUNE OF FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND LOS ANGELES. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES SIX MILLION IN LONG BEACH AND JUST UNDER TEN MILLION IN SAN DIEGO ALL WHILE FOR GOING PUBLIC FUNDING FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. AB NINETEEN TEN AIMS AT GOLF BUT IT HITS EVERY OTHER ACTIVE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY BY CREATING A PRECEDENT FOR PEACE MAILING EVERYONE OF THEM OUT OF CALIFORNIA'S PARK FRATERNITY.

I'M SURE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE SHOULD SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. THIS QUIRK-SILVA. YES I SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I DO WANT TO JUST GIVE THE SUMMARY AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF- CONCERN WHEN THIS BILL ESTABLISHES AND AS THE CENTER OF PROGRAM TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES TO FACILITATE THE CONVERSATION. OF MELISSA PULLEY BONE GOLF COURSES INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO LET'S RESTATE WHAT THAT MEANS THAT MEANS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MEANING THE CITIES WOULD BE ABLE TO PURSUE THIS OR NOT PURSUE IT- THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO OPEN IT UP FOR A CONVERSATION IF THEY'RE- COUNCIL DOES NOT THINK THIS IS WORTHY OF A- CONVERSATION. SO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED I UNDERSTAND THAT IT FEELS LIKE A KIND OF LIKE WHY US VERSUS YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC PARK. THE REASON IS THAT MANY MANY GOLF PLACES FULLER TEN HOUSING MINISTER POKE GOLF UP YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY YOU DON'T JUST GET TO GO ON TO THE COURSE AND KIND OF HAVE A PICNIC WITH YOUR FAMILY- AND AGAIN THIS DOES NOT MEAN. THERE THERE ISN'T A GOOD USE. FOR GOLF- PLACES THERE'S ALSO VERY PRIVATE PLACES IN MANY CITIES BUT THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT CITY WOULD A TUB PARTAKEN IF THEY CHOOSE THEY DO NOT NEED TO PROMISES ARE BY PURPOSES WITH THE- GOLF COURSES A LOT OF PUBLIC COURSES ARE LONG ALONG FREEWAY ROUTES OR UNDER AIR THAT AIR TRAFFIC ROUTES AND THE REASON THEY'RE THERE IS BECAUSE THE THAT WAS LANDED A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO MAYBE DEVELOP BECAUSE OF THE- J. SENSE- IMPACTS FROM NOISE AND- AIR POLLUTION ETCETERA. PREVIOUSLY IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN THIS HOUSE- THE CONCERNS ABOUT BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING- ALONG AREAS THAT ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPACTED IN OUR EFFORTS TO AND PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT A LOT OF THE PUBLIC COURSES THAT ARE ALONGSIDE THE FREEWAYS IN IN AREAS THAT ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPACTED- HOW DO WE IMPORTANT ARE THOSE COMMUNITIES GOING TO BE EXCLUDED FROM A GRANT PROGRAM- BASED ON THAT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- FOCUS. OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE I HAD A YEAR- INTERESTED IN THE E. J. CLEAN AIR OF PIECE OF THE LEGISLATION BUT I LOVE TO WORK ON AND I WAS LISTENING TO THEM AND HOW YOU DID IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M INTERESTED BECAUSE ACTUALLY THOSE THOSE THINGS ALONG THE FREEWAY ARE MORE ACTUALLY SUITABLE FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE GREEN SPACE THAT WE HAVE. SO I'LL LET YOU ANSWER THAT FIRST AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER FOLLOWING AND I ACTUALLY I LIVE UP OF THOSE FREEWAYS THAT MOVE ALL THE BITS OF MANSON TRAFFIC DEFINES MY LIFE I HAVE SIX FREEWAYS THAT TOOK MY DISTRICT I DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF GOLF COURSES ALONG THE FREEWAY BUT I DO HAVE EIGHT GOLF COURSES WITHIN A SEVEN MILE RADIUS OF MY HOUSE FOR A REALLY IRVINE COMMUNITY. KIND OF THE ONLY SPACE WE HAVE ½T THERE SO I WORK ON A REGULAR BASIS TO CLEAN UP OUR ERROR- WHETHER THAT'S ENSURING THAT WE HAVE- CLEAN ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION- MONITORING AND OTHER WAYS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS OUT THERE ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR THE CJ COMMUNITIES THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM IF COMMUNITIES FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT SUITED FOR THEM AND WHAT THEY HAVE THERE'S A BETTER USE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO USE THIS PROGRAM THIS MAINTAINS LOCAL CONTROL AND ALLOW THE COMMUNITY. TO DICTATE HOW BEST TO YOU SPACES IN THAT COMMUNITY FEEL THAT IT'S A BETTER USE TO REPURPOSE UP OF COURSE WE WANT TO HELP INCENTIVIZE THAT SPECIALLY FOR CONTRACT CITIES LIKE THE METHOD I HAVE THAT DON'T HAVE OFTENTIMES THE BUDGETS TO PARTAKE THIS UP TO GO DOWN THIS THIS ROAD ON THEIR OWN OUT THERE BUT IF THEY DO ARE THEY GOING TO BE DENIED THAT OPPORTUNITY. BASED ON THE E. J. THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS BASED ON THE J. THE COMMERCE. OF THE- WOULD BE HAVING THEIR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ABOUT A PROPERTY AT THAT THEY ARE SUBSIDIZING AND THEY'RE PAYING FOR THEIR TAX DOLLARS SO. ONE A ONE OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER TO THAT ONE OF THE- COMMENTS IT IS ABOUT- THE- THE- USE OF AN EXPENSE YOU KNOW IT DOES SOME SOME PEOPLE DO HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY. AND GOLF COURSES BUT- I KNOW ONE GUY CHESTER WASHINGTON A GOLF COURSE DOWN THERE AND- JUST OUTSIDE OF- HAWTHORNE. IN SOUTH CENTRAL LA. HEAVILY USED AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS FOR THE USE THAT ARE IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND I FEAR THAT LOSING. SPACE LIKE THAT FOR THEM. WILL BE IMPACTING THEIR LIVES BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE AT CHESTER- WASHINGTON AND THAT'S TURNED INTO HOUSING INSTEAD- THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING-TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE TRAVELING FOR TEN TO FIFTEEN MILES. HAD TO GO TO ANOTHER COURSE- TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE HELP THOSE USE CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I WOULD CONJECTURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE POLY ACTIVITY- AND HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH THEIR LOCAL ELECTED- TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR- SPACE AND SAID THIS. CREATE A PROCESS TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE A- OFFERS THAT I PASS BY EVERY DAY HAVE BEEN PASSING BAD ALL MY LIFE THAT'S GATED- THAT HAS VERY FEW OF THE USERS AND IT. AND ON A REGULAR BASIS MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE ASKING FOR THAT SPACE TO PLAY SOCCER- THEY'RE ASKING VETS BASE TO THINK ABOUT IT AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE A LOT OF HOUSING INSECURITY IN MY COMMUNITY AS WELL. THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE ASKING FOR THAT THE COUNCIL MEMBERS TRYING TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS. WHEN YOU HAVE A GENERAL FUND OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IT'S HARD TO PARCEL OUT- THE MONEY STEVEN BEGIN THAT PROCESS. I'M AT I'M BEING RESPONSIVE TO THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS. LOVE THEIR GOLF COURSES IN THEIR COFFERS ARE GONNA STAY THERE BECAUSE THAT THAT CONVERSATION WITH DICK LOCAL LIKE THIS IT'S ALSO CLEAR. THAT THE SENATE ELIMINATE IT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES THAT PURCHASE STATION FOR THE COMMUNITY. TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THEIR LIKE THIS ABOUT HOW TO BEST USE. THE SPACE IN SOME FOR SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT THE ONLY SPACE THAT'S LEFT. J. TRANCERS THANK MISTER KALRA THANK YOU ADAM SHERIDAN THANK YOU THE AUTHORITY YOU BEEN LIKE THE ENERGIZER BUNNY. BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- AND AGAIN JUST. I THINK THAT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED ME WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU'RE NOT THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT YOU CAN ANSWER THAT BECAUSE- THIS IS A LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE YOU'RE ACTUALLY LETTING THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. MAKE THAT DECISION SOUNDS THAT WE HAVE THREE PUBLIC GOLF COURSES IN RECENT YEARS THE COUNCIL HAS HAD THAT CONVERSATION THEY'VE OPTED TO KEEP THEM AT THE END OF THE DAY. TEN YEARS NOW THEY OPTED. NOT KEEP ONE OF THEM THAT AGAIN WILL BE A LOCAL CONVERSATION THAT IF THEY CHOOSE TO GO THAT DIRECTION THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME IS AN ASSAULT IS A BIGGER CITY WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUDGET BUT TO YOUR POINT. SOME OF THE SMALLER JUST I JUST CAN'T EVEN CAN'T EVEN GO DOWN THAT ROAD BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT WHAT HAVE YOU SO I THINK THIS REALLY JUST FACILITATES ALL CONTROL. UP ON THIS ISSUE IF THERE'S A HEAVILY USED GOLF COURSE- IN THE COMMUNITY I THINK THE COMMUNITY WILL STEP FORTH SO YOU KNOW WHAT A LOT OF OUR KIDS GO THERE THE HIGH SCHOOL PROJECT. WHATEVER IT IS OF COURSE IS NOT BEING USED A LOT LESS THAN THEY CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S DEFINITELY WE HAVE SO COMPLY PRISTINE ALL THAT IN THERE AND DON'T. THEY THEY MAKE THE ARGUMENT OF THE CITY COUNCIL AS TO WHAT THE USE OF THOSE COURSE SHOULD BE ANNOUNCED LATE IT SHOULD BE RATIONALLY. BRING IN THAT CONVERSATION BACK TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT'S WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION IT ISN'T A TOP DOWN WHAT IT IS THAT LOOK. IF YOU DECIDE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION WILL HELP FACILITATE IT AND WILL HELP GIVE YOU INCENTIVES TO MOVE THAT DIRECTION- IF THERE'S OF COURSE THAT. YEP THERE IS A- DISTRICT. THEY DON'T TO SPEND THE- TO FIX IT UP OR- IS NOT. USED BY THERE'S TWO OR THREE OTHER ARE BEING HELD. USUALLY KNOW WE'LL KEEP. AND THIS ON. ONE THAT'S HAD THAT KIND. SO I THINK YOU'VE- IN ALL OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE MOVE THIS IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. I UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE SOME FOLKS THE GULF COMMITTEE AWAIT ABOUT A SLIPPERY SLOPE BUT- THIS IS REALLY JUST ABOUT. ALLOWING ALL THE OPTIONS ON THE TABLE FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS FOR THAT I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS. UP MR GABRIEL I THINK WHEN HE WANTS TO CLOSE OUR ANY ANYONE ELSE. ON THAT ICE OKAY- MY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AGAIN I SUPPORT IT LAST TIME IT MADE IT THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE- SIXTY. TO VOTE I BELIEVE- SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN AND ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WORK I KNOW YOU'RE VERY COMMITTED TO THAT AND I WAS DISCUSSED HERE- AND I WILL ALSO SAY THIS BILL I THINK OF IT. ALLOWS FOR MORE LOCAL CONTROL SO I WOULD ASSUME LOCAL CONTROL. SUPPORTERS WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL- SO I'M HAPPY TO- HOPEFULLY GET THIS BLOOD COMMITTEE TODAY- BEFORE WE DO ROLE I THINK WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. WE GOT IT. WE DID OKAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE BY. WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ROLL CALL PLEASE. THE MOTION TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WICKS I. SEYARTO NO THE ARSENAL. CORREO REAL I GABRIEL GABRIEL CALL. ALL RIGHT HI. QUIRK-SILVA HI QUIRK-SILVA WARD WARD I THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU MISTER SEA OF. NEXT WE HAVE MISSED YOUR CURRENT. GOOD MORNING WHAT A MAN CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN FORTY FIVE LEGISLATION TO SPEED AFFORDABLE HOME RECONSTRUCTION IN THE WAKE OF A DECLARED EMERGENCY CALIFORNIA'S RECENT NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE DEVASTATED COMMUNICATE COMMUNITIES AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THROUGH THEM MANY OF WHOM ARE STILL REBUILDING THEIR HOMES THEIR LIVELIHOOD. AND THEIR LIVELIHOOD YOU KNOW THE WILDFIRES OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DESTROYED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES IN THE COUNTIES OF BUTTE COLUSA GLENN LAKE MENDOCINO NAPA SANTA BARBARA SHASTA CINEMA TRINITY AND VENTURA. THE DEADLY CAMPFIRE ALONE DESTROYED THE ENTIRE TOWN OF PARADISE IN NEARLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES KILLED EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE WAS THE DEADLIEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. AND FIVE OF THE SIX BIGGEST FIRES IN THE TOTAL ACREAGE IN TOTAL ACREAGE OCCURRED IN TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE LOSS OF TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STRUCTURES MORE THAN THIRTY LIVES AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DAMAGE. FEDERAL DISASTER FUNDING TRADITIONALLY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR NATURAL DESERVE DISASTERS IS INSUFFICIENT AND IT TAKES YEARS TO OBTAIN. IT TOOK NEARLY TWO YEARS AFTER THE DISASTROUS FOR HAD TO SIGN OFF ON ANY OF THE STATE'S PROPOSALS TO RESPOND TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES AND IT WAS FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE FUNDS WERE DEPLOYED AS A RESULT RECOVERY HAS BEEN SLOW AND MOST IN NEED OF HELP. DO NOT GET IT UNTIL LONG AFTER THE DISASTER AB NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WOULD ETABLISH AN AFFORDABLE DISASTER HOUSING REVOLVING DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION PROGRAM TO FUND THE PRE DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ACQUISITION CONSTRUCTION RECKON RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION OF PROPERTY TO DEVELOP OR PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE'S FEDERALLY DECLARED. DISASTER AREAS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE DAMAGE AND LOSS OF HOMES OCCUPIED BY OR AFFECTING LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO APPLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR FUNDING TO MAKE SHORT TERM OR LOANS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CONSUMERS. THE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING RELATED POST DISASTER RECOVERY EFFORTS INCLUDING ACQUISITION REHABILITATION AND NEW CONSTRUCTION. THE SHORT TERM LOANS WOULD BE REPAID THROUGH THE FEDERAL DISASTER RECOVERY FUNDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPROVED PLAN OF ACTION WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTING THEIR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL R. BRIAN GUSTER RIVER. CALIFORNIA COLDEST COALITION OF RURAL HOUSING AND LARRY FLORIN- CEO AND PRESENT THE BURBANK HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU GO AHEAD GERMAN OF FIVE MINUTES BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU EXCELLENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- YOU. BRINING US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR RURAL HOUSING AND THE RURAL COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE CORPORATION. WHEN DISASTER STRIKES ARE ORGANIZATIONS WORK CLOSELY WITH THOSE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND FOR EXAMPLE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAMPFIRE WHICH THE AUTHOR MENTIONED- ORGANIZATIONS RCC THROUGH ITS T. A. M. ROLE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ROMANCES HERE H. ITS MEMBERS AS PROVIDERS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE WORKING CLOSELY ON THE REBUILDING EFFORT. THEY'RE PART OF THAT ONGOING EFFORT THE MONEY THAT WAS APPROVED BY CONGRESS AND CDBG DR- ALLOCATION SHORTLY AFTER THAT DISASTER STRUCK IS JUST NOW ARRIVING SO. THREE PLUS YEARS LATER WE'RE FINALLY SEEING THAT MONEY HELP US DELIVER HOUSING HELP US DELIVER INFRASTRUCTURE. THE URBAN INSTITUTE DID A STUDY OF HOW THE C. B. G. D. R. PROGRAM ROLLS OUT ACROSS STATES AND FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE IT TAKES TWENTY MONTHS. AND FEMA ASSISTANCE USUALLY ENDS AFTER EIGHTEEN AND OBVIOUSLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE SEEING EVEN LONGER THAN THAT SO THERE'S AN ENORMOUS GAP AB FORTY NINETY FIVE SOLVES THAT PROBLEM CREATES A REVOLVING LOAN FUND IT'S A MODEL THAT'S BEING USED IN OTHER STATES RIGHT NOW. SUCCESSFULLY AND IT'S ALSO A MODEL THAT WE HAVE USED SUCCESSFULLY IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE GHOST ACQUISITION FUN TO WORK WITH COMEDIC ELEMENTS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO QUICKLY DEPLOY RESOURCES THAT NEED TO GET OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THAT'S IT IT'S A WORKING MODEL THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS WOULD REPLICATE IT TO DELIVER DISASTER ASSISTANCE AND WE THINK SOLVE MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING AND FOR THAT WE WOULD URGE AND ABOUT. THANK YOU RYAN MY NAME IS LARRY FLORIN THE CEO OF BURBANK HOUSING WE'RE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING NONPROFIT BASED IN SANTA ROSA. WE'VE BUILT OVER FIVE THOUSAND HOMES IN SONOMA AND NAPA COUNTIES SINCE WE WERE FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FORMER OWNER OF THE JOURNEY'S END MOBILE HOME PARK. IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY WILDFIRES THE PARK WAS DEVASTATED BY THE FIRES FOR THE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO TRAILERS. DESTROYED AND FIVE PEOPLE SHOULD BE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO TRAILERS JUST TRY TO FIVE PEOPLE DIED IN THE FIRES. I'M IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I WAS PART OF A DELEGATION THAT TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON TO ADVOCATE FOR DISASTER RELIEF FUNDING. WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SECURING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR THE COUNTIES IMPACTED BY THE FIRES. IN THE FORM OF CDBG DISASTER RELIEF FUNDING THE FIRST TIME I SHOULD NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA'S RECEIVE SUCH FUNDING. UNFORTUNATELY LARGELY BECAUSE OF FEDERAL PROCESS HE'S IT IS TAKEN AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME TO ACCESS THE FUNDS. THE PROJECT HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND WENT THROUGH THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS IN AN AMAZINGLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME FOR SUCH A COMPLICATED PROCESS. WE ACTUALLY EARLIER THIS YEAR A LATE LAST YEAR ACTUALLY WITH THE FIRST PROJECT TO ACCESS THESE DISASTER RELIEF FUNDS AND CLOSED ON THE CDBG DR. CONSTRUCTION OF FUNDING AND STARTED CONSTRUCTION IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AFTER THE FIRES AND TWO YEARS AFTER WE WERE SEE FULL ENTITLEMENTS OR OTHERWISE READY TO GO. WITH AN EIGHTEEN MONTH CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE WILL BE CLOSE TO SIX YEARS BEFORE THE RESIDENTS ARE ABLE TO MOVE BACK THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY LONG TIME FOR SOMEONE DISPLACED BY NATURAL DISASTERS. ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE CUT OVER TWO YEARS OFF THE PROCESS- I SHOULD ALSO COME INTO ONE'S PERMANENT FINANCING CAME THROUGH. IT WILL ALLOW US TO REPAY WHATEVER FUNDS WOULD HAVE BEEN. PUT FORWARD FOR THE PROJECT TO PRE DEVELOPMENT. SO WE WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. Q.

I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING IN THE CHAIR FOR PROVIDING REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR MY WITNESSES THAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM LATER. AND OF COURSE TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS ANALYSIS. AB TWENTY TWO OH THREE WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS BY PROHIBITING HOUSING PROVIDERS FROM REQUIRING CREDIT CHECKS FOR APPLICANTS WITH PUBLICLY FUNDED HOUSING SUBSIDIES. THE BILL WILL ALSO ELIMINATE THE APPLICANT FEES SUBSIDY HOLDERS. AB TWO WHICH IS THE FEE IS USED TYPICALLY USED FOR CREDIT CHECKS. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO REDUCING RENTAL ASSISTANT BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN TWENTY NINETEEN SB THREE TWENTY NINE AUTHORED BY FORMER SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL PROHIBITED HOUSING PROVIDERS FROM REFUSING. TO RENT TO SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY USE A HOUSING SUBSIDY TO AFFORD THEIR RENT. UNFORTUNATELY RENTAL APPLICANTS APPLICANTS WITH HOUSING SUBSIDIES ARE BEING REJECTED BASED ON POOR CREDIT HISTORY EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY PAYS FOR ALL OR MOST OF THE RENT. THE STATE DOES NOT PROHIBIT A HOUSING PROVIDER FROM CONDUCTING A CREDIT CHECK ON AN APPLICANT USING A HOUSING SUBSIDY NOR DOES THE STATE PROHIBIT REJECTING AN APPLICANT BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THEIR CREDIT CHECK. A RECENT OP SACBEE ARTICLE CHRONICLED TO MEL BROWN WHO WAS UNDER HOUSE TO FOR TEN YEARS BEFORE RECEIVING A HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE MONTHS BROWN APPLIED TO OVER THIRTY APARTMENTS THAT REQUIRED A FORTY DOLLAR APPLICANT FEE. EACH TIME SHE IS STILL HOMELESS. HOUSING PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH HOUSING SUBSIDIES BY REJECTING THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHAKY CREDIT. TYPICALLY INDIVIDUALS WHO QUALIFY FOR HOUSING SUBSIDIES ARE LOW INCOME OR HAVE LOW OR NO CREDIT AT ALL. THEREFORE ASSESSING  RENTAL APPLICANTS ELIGIBILITY THROUGH CREDIT CHECKS CAN EASILY RESULT IN AN APPLICATION DENIAL AS PEOPLE WITH HOUSING SUBSIDIES OFTEN HAVE LOW CREDIT SCORES POOR CREDIT OR NO CREDIT HISTORY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW OR NO CREDIT CAN ACCESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHOUT A RISK OF PUTTING UP MONEY FOR THE APPLICATION FEES JUST TO GET DENIED. TODAY I HAVE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF STRONGER WOMEN UNITED CALLIE WRITER AND DEBORAH CRAFT PROVIDING TESTIMONY STRONGER WOMEN UNITED OUR COLLECTIVE OF WOMEN WITH LIVED EXPERTISE AND HOUSING DISPLACEMENT.

TWO FROM YEARS WHILE WAITING A WHILE ON THE WAITING LIST FOR THE STANDARD SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DURING THIS TIME I WORKED SPORADICALLY UNTIL I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER I SURVIVED CANCER TREATMENTS WHILE LIVING IN CROWDED MASS SHELTERS MY CREDIT SCORE DROP TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POINTS WHILE I WAS ANNOUNCED MOSTLY BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF INCOME. AFTER TWO AND A HALF YEARS I REPEAT THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED HOUSING VOUCHER I THOUGHT HOUSING WITHIN MY REACH HOWEVER I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. HOUSING PROVIDERS REJECTED MY APPLICATION EIGHTEEN TIMES IN A ROW EVEN THOUGH I HAD A VOUCHER AND HAND. MOST OF THE TIME THE HOUSING PROVIDERS REJECTED MY APPLICATION. BECAUSE OF MY LOW CREDIT SCORE EACH TIME I AM APPLYING FOR AN APARTMENT MY HOPES SOARED ONLY TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE GROUND. I KNEW THAT I HAD TO USE MY VOUCHER AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS OR LOSE THAT AS IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT MY CREDIT HISTORY WAS PREVENTING ME FROM USING MY VOUCHER I BECAME INCREASINGLY DISCOURAGED PARENTS. PANIC ANXIOUS DEPRESSED AND SCARED I FEAR THAT THE VOUCHER WAS JUST ANOTHER BROKEN PROMISE AND I WOULD REMAIN LESS. WHILE SEARCHING FOR AN APARTMENT I SPENT AROUND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS ON RENTAL APPLICATIONS I HAD TO CUT DOWN ON FOOD AND GAS IN ORDER TO PAY THOSE FEES AND I WAS LUCKY.

GOOD WHATEVER I'M KAREN MEMBERS IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AFTER TWO YEARS- DEBRA CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. TO THE LEGISLATION THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER ANSWERS HERE BUT UNFORTUNATELY- WE OBJECT TO A- APPS MAKING A LANDLORD HAVE TO BLINDLY ACCEPT AN INDIVIDUAL WHAT THE SIDE EFFECTS WILL BE HERE. IS THAT IF YOU CANNOT USE A CREDIT CHECK A RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER WILL REQUIRE EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION- THEY WILL PROBABLY REQUIRE BANK RECORDS TAX RECORDS CREDIT CARDS YOU NAME IT THEY'RE REQUIRE IT PERHAPS EVEN A- INDIVIDUAL TO GUARANTOR WHICH IS A POSITIVE THING IN THESE CASES TO ENSURE THAT SOMEBODY CAN GET HOUSING. REMEMBER ALSO THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE. PASSED RENT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS- REPORTED TO CREATE REPORTS BECAUSE WE HAVE A LAW THAT SAYS THAT WILL NOT APPEAR ON THE ON THE CREDIT REPORT- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S AT SENATORS STEVE RADFORD HAD A PRAGMATIC APPROACH WE BELIEVE WITH S. B. O. ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN AND THAT LAW REQUIRES. THAT LANDLORDS OF ASSISTING HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS OFFER TENANTS THE OPTION TO HAVE THEIR RENT REPORTED- YOU TO THEIR THEIR POSITIVE RENT REPORTED TO CREDIT AGENCIES AND THEN THERE'S ALSO- BENEFICIAL SERVICES TODAY THAT HELP INDIVIDUALS BUILD THEIR CREDIT REPORTS. SUCH AS EXPERIAN BOOST- FIGHT COKE I CHIME CREDIT REPAIR AND ALL THOSE OTHER EXAMPLES ARE OUT THERE I THINK TO HELP INDIVIDUALS BUILD THEIR CREDIT WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND AND- AND HEARD THE OPPOSITION. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE ALSO TO FIND SOME DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS. BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS WILL BLINDLY- HAND OVER HOUSING I'M WITHOUT ADDED DOCUMENTATIONS IF THEY CAN'T OBJECTIVELY LOOK AT A CREDIT REPORT SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE MR GABRIEL. I THINK YOU ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE COURTESY I WOULD HAVE TO STEP OUT A MOMENT FOR. A PHONE CALL I'D AND I WANT TO. THANK THE OTHER FOR THE BILL I HAD A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT IT AND AS I SHARED WITH HER M. I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THE BILL I HAVE A I HAVE AN AUTHOR PROBLEM HERE WHICH IS THAT I REALLY RESPECT AND ADMIRE THE AUTHOR. AND THINK THAT SHE DOES A LOT OF WONDERFUL PUBLIC POLICY PARTICULAR IN THIS AREA YOU'VE BEEN A REAL LEADER IN THE ASSEMBLY ON THIS- BUT I AM SO YOU KNOW I DUG INTO THE ANALYSIS IN THERE SOME PARTS OF THIS THAT I THINK MAYBE THEY'RESTRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND- OR OR OR I'M NOT SURE THAT I'M FULLY COMFORTABLE WITH AND SO I'M JUST GOING TO LAY IT OUT THERE AND WOULD LOVE. FOR YOU TO RESPOND TO AND THEN MAYBE IF- PRIMARY OPPOSITION WHEN THIS WANTS TO CHIME IN AS WELL- SO BE A FIRST I THINK IF YOU SEE IT ON A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE WHICH IS THAT IT'S WAY TOO HARD FOR FOLKS TO GET VOUCHERS AND TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING- AND I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S A CONTESTED ISSUE. I'M WHAT I'M WONDERING WITH IS A COUPLE THINGS HERE I'M AND ONE IS MAYBE JUST TO MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING TO ME. THIS ISN'T AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THIS REALLY REINFORCES SOURCE OF INCOME DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORK THAT WE DID WITH SENATOR MITCHELL'S BELL BECAUSE TO ME THIS IS ABOUT. IF IT'S ALL OF THE UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE OUR FOLKS ARE RECEIVING VOUCHERS WERE REALLY PICKING BETWEEN CHU CHU LOW INCOME FOLKS HERE RIGHT IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE DISCRIMINATING IN FAVOR AGAINST A LOW INCOME PERSON IN FAVOR OF A HIGH INCOME PERSON WE'RE TALKING THE UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE HERE. AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS LOW INCOME FOLKS ONE OF MY MISS UNDERSTANDING THAT. YEAH THIS BILL. ALL APPLY. TO INDIVIDUALS THAT. HAVE A HOUSING VOUCHER OF PUBLICLY FUNDED HOUSING VOUCHER. I'M THEY CAN BE APPLYING. FOR A HOUSING UNIT. AND IT COULD BE SOMEONE LIKE ME ALSO APPLYING FOR THAT SAME HOUSING UNIT. RIGHT IT'S NOT LIKE. THAT HOUSING UNIT. HASN'T ALL. OF PUBLICLY. FUNDED VOUCHER RECIPIENTS. APPLYING FOR THE SAME UNIT. AND SO IN THAT SITUATION THEY'D BE ABLE TO ASK THE- AND THE PERSON WITHOUT THE VOUCHER FOR CREDIT SCORE THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ASK THE PERSON WITH THE HOUSING ABOUT. OKAY I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING ABOUT THAT IS THAT ARE WE INADVERTENTLY- MAKING IT HARDER FOR THAT PERSON TO GET THE UNIT AND I YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION YOU KNOW ARE WE GONNA MAKE THE LANDLORD MORE RELUCTANT TO ACTUALLY LEASED TO A PERSON. WHO IS LOW INCOME IN WHO HAS THE VOUCHER BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE CREDIT SCORE. END OF ALTERNATIVELY ARE WE JUST SORT OF REPLACING ONE BARRIER WITH ANOTHER I MEAN I WAS READING IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT THAT THEY'LL ASK FOLKS FOR TAX RECORDS AND BANK RECORDS AND EMPLOYMENT RECORDS AND THOSE. AT LEAST AS I THINK ABOUT IT AND I'M OPEN TO BEING PERSUADED OTHERWISE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT COULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO GO COLLECT RIGHT IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO YOUR EMPLOYER AND ASK FOR SEVERAL MONTHS WORTH OF- PAY STUBS IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO YOUR BANK CAN GET BANK STATEMENTS IF YOU HAVE TO GO. AND PICK UP YOUR TAX RECORDS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE- I THINK THOSE COULD POTENTIALLY POSE BERRIES AND YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE CREDIT SCORES RIGHT AS ITS- AGGREGATES ALL THAT INFORMATION QUICKLY SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD. SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE PART OF OUR- OF REQUIRING A CREDIT CHECK THERE'S ALWAYS A FEAT THAT GOES TOWARD- GETTING THE CREDIT REPORT- AS I SAID IN MY- STATEMENT. BOB THESE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE APPLYING SOMETIMES IT'S USED TYPICALLY FORTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A CREDIT CHECK. AND THEY'RE APPLYING FOR MULTIPLE- RENTAL UNITS RIGHT AND THERE THEY GET REJECTED FROM ALL OF THEM SPENDING FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND SO. THIS IS NOT ONLY A BARRIER TO FOR THEM TO GET THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT IF SOMEONE HAS A HOUSING SUBSIDY THE LANDLORD KNOWS THEY'RE GOING TO GET PAID. RIGHT AND SO WHY ARE WE PUTTING THIS BARRIER THERE RIGHT THE OTHER- ITEMS THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT WILL BE COLLECTED IT DOESN'T COST. ANYTHING TO COLLECT THAT SHOW IS SO THEN THE CREDIT CHECK I CAN'T I CAN'T YOU CAN'T PROVIDE A CREDIT CHECK IF THE LANDLORD HAS TO PAY A SERVER S. TWO. TO COLLECT THAT CREDIT REPORT. DOWN TO THE NEW ISSUE HERE I GUESS I'M UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S LESS THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT REPORT IT'S MORE THE FEE. TO RUN THE CREDIT REPORT. I THINK IT'S BOTH OKAY. AND ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE. THAT HAVE LITTLE TO NO CREDIT HISTORY RIGHT THEY CAN BE PAYING FOR A CREDIT REPORT. AND IT COMES BACK WITH VERY LITTLE. UP CREDIT HISTORY- I KNOW YOU KNOW MY FAMILY. DIDN'T GET A CREDIT CARD UNTIL I WAS A TEENAGER. RIGHT ON I AM. VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE HAD PLACE TO LIVE- WHEN I WAS A KID. BUT YOU KNOW SOMEONE LIKE MY MOM WHICH WAS A SINGLE MOTHER. DIDN'T HAVE CREDIT CREDIT HISTORY SO COULDN'T APPLY. FOR AN APARTMENT UNIT RIGHT WE HAD TO RELY. ON HOMES WHERE THEY WERE RENT TÍNH AND- EIGHTY YOU IN THE BACK RIGHT WHERE. THE LANDLORD WAS LESS LIKELY TO. REQUIRE A CREDIT REPORT. ARE YOU KNOW LIKE ARE THE OPPOSITION MENTIONED- THE BRADFORD BUILD THE SENATE BILL THAT. WOULD HAVE ALLOWED SOMEONE WITH LITTLE TO NO CREDIT. TO OUR- INCLUDE THESE THESE RENT PAYMENTS AS PART OF THEIR CREDIT STRUM. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THAT. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE CREDIT YOU'LL NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. RIGHT IF YOU CAN GET INTO A UNIT. BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO CREDIT. ANNUAL YOU'RE HAVING TO PAY THESE FEES YOU'LL NEVER HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A CREDIT HISTORY- VIA YEAR OLD. RENTAL PAYMENTS MADE ON TIME. I KNOW THE YOU YOU BEEN A LEE. IN YOU KNOW PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS KEEPING PEOPLE HOUSED- IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THIS IS ONE WAY TO DO IT IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY. RIGHT IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALL OF OUR ISSUES ON HOMELESSNESS BUT- WE'RE SPENDING. OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND A UNIT. YOU KNOW FOR HOMELESS TO FOR UNITS FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND HEAR PEOPLE THAT. QUALIFIED FOR VOUCHER. WANT TO RENT A UNIT AND ARE NOT AND THERE'S A BARRIERS TO GETTING MEN. ARE I WOULD RATHER THEM GET IN AND THAT WAY IT SAVES US FUNDS FOR OTHERS YOU KNOW AND IT KEEPS THEM HOUSE STE. YEAH NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THE INTENTIONS HERE ARE ARE TOTALLY SPOT ON I AM I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AS I SAID IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE- I'M JUST TRYING TO. GREAT GRAPPLE WITH THE FACT ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS- WHAT I THINK THE BEST WAY TO GET AT THAT ISSUE IS CAN I ASK MADAM CHAIR A QUESTION OF THE OPPOSITION- SO- HOME. GIVE HER A MOMENT TO MAKE HER WAY UP HERE- ET I I'D HER JUNIOR TESTIMONY MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE- AB WITH SOME SYMPATHY TO WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE AND THERE MIGHT E OTHER WAYS TO GET OUT THIS AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REFERRING TO. THE FEE OF THE CREDIT CHECK OTHER INFORMATION SO I'M JUST WONDERING YOU KNOW TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT A LITTLE BIT WHAT ARE SOME OTHER WAYS THAT YOU THINK MAYBE. WE COULD ACCOMPLISH SOME OF THESE OBJECTIVES CERTAINLY WELL WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PAY ALL OF YOUR RENT DOESN'T PAY YOUR BILLS EXCEPT TRACK- THERE COULD BE A FUNDING PROGRAM TO HELP- WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF THE CREDIT REPORT THERE'S THIRD PARTY CIVIL HOW'S YOUR CREDIT REPORT- ON AN INDEPENDENT SYSTEM- I KNOW WE'RE TALKING WITH A SOME MEMBER WARD ABOUT OPTIONS LIKE THAT. SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY EVERY SINGLE TIME BUT THAT ONLY SOLVED PART OF YOUR ISSUE RIGHT I THINK THE I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON WHEN YOU INDICATED THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO COLLECT ALL THIS DATA IF THEY CAN'T- THEIR CREDIT REPORT IS NOT AVAILABLE- AND BY THEN THE- THE UNITS RENTED. SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A BARRIER SO I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS OF IT'S JUST ABOUT I THINK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REDUCE ADULTS ABOUT TWO THINGS IT'S THE COST OF THE CREDIT REPORT- AND IT'S ABOUT THE CREDIT SCORE NOW IN TALKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THEY SAY THE CREDIT SCORE IS NOT THE ONLY THING THEY USE. THEY USE EVERYTHING- DURING THE LAST FORECLOSURE CRISIS EVERYBODY BECAME SEEM LIKE EVERYBODY THAT CAME TO APPLY HOW TO FOR CLOSURE ON THE RECORD SO LANDLORDS SHOULD STOP USING THAT SCORE IT'S JUST NOT A SCORE THAT IS NECESSARILY DEPENDABLE ANYMORE. SO THEY HAD TOLD ME THAT THEY DON'T USE JUST THE CREDIT SCORE BUT A LOT OF OTHER INFORMATION. LANDLORDS CAN ASK FOR BANK RECORDS. AT FOR ANY OF US BUT- FINE. YOU KNOW I. RECENTLY APPLIED FOR A UNIT AND I HAD TO SUBMIT. RECORDS THAT DID TAKE ME AWHILE TO COLLECT RIGHT IN OF IT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN BECAUSE AND THEY OF COURSE I HAD TO PAY A FEE FOR A CREDIT SCORE- BUT THIS THIS BILL IS VERY NARROW IT'S ONLY FOR THOSE. THAT HAVE A PUBLIC SUBSIDY RIGHT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW I DON'T AGREE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD NOT GET YOU KNOW SHOULD NOT PAY FOR A CREDIT REPORT- ONLY FOR THOSE THAT HAVE. THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY VOUCHERS YEAH NO THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL I WILL TELL YOU PART OF WHAT GOT ME THINK ABOUT THIS AS CANDIDLY AS YOU KNOW WE JUST REFINANCED OUR HOME IT WAS SUCH A PAIN IN THE **** TO GO AROUND AND COLLECT ALL THE DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS MANY TOOK US. SO MANY DAYS TO JUST GOT ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLACES YOU FORGET YOUR PASSWORD YOU GOT TO RESET YOUR PASSWORD AND LOG ON AND PULL THAT DOCUMENT- YOU KNOW REALLY IT REALLY STIMULATED MY THINKING ABOUT. THE KIND OF BARRIERS THAT WE MIGHT SET UP SO I APPRECIATE THE INTENT. APPRECIATE WHAT I HEARD FROM YOU I THINK THERE- I'M VERY INTRIGUED BY WHAT YOU MENTION I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING MEMBER WHITE HOUSE THAT BILL BUT- RUNNING SO MUCH CREDIT CHECK ONCE AND THEN HAVING THAT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP PAYING THE FORTY DOLLARS FEE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THAT. THAT DID CATCH MY ATTENTION AS A REAL ISSUE FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS WHO ARE SEARCHING FOR SOMEWHERE TO USE THIS VOUCHER. AND ALMOST LIKE TEASING THEM BY SAYING HERE'S A VOUCHER AND THEN THEY CAN'T. YOU KNOW THE CAN'T GET A PLACE TO LIVE SO- APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS ON BOTH SIDES. AND IF YOU ALREADY COLLECTED. YOUR RECORDS FOR THE FIRST APPLICATION. BY THE TENTH ONE YOU ALREADY HAVE THEM. SO THAT TIME THAT YOU'RESAYING IS A BARRIER. RIGHT YOU ALREADY HAVE COLLECTED ALL OF THEM. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISS CARILLO AND THEN MISSED QUIRK-SILVA. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL I THINK WOULD- MY COLLEAGUE ALSO BRINGS UP IN TERMS OF. INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ARE REQUESTING- A CREDIT SCORES FROM OR YOUR BILL FOR POTENTIALLY NOT- REQUESTING. AS COURSE FROM REALLY IT'S REALLY AN ISSUE IT'S A PIVOTING OF TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION BETWEEN US VERSUS THEM THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ALREADY. BUT WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED I THINK EVEN A MINUTE THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT WERE IN PLACE BEFORE DIDN'T WORK. AND SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE SOMETHING DIFFERENT YOU HAVE I THINK YOU KNOW SAID IT REALLY WELL IN TERMS OF. INDIVIDUALS THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN A CYCLE OF POVERTY BECAUSE THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY THERE THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY ARE VERY HIGH. AND SO THEN HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON ISSUES RELATED TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ON THE PREVENTION SIDE NOT FOR FOLKS THAT ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING THAT BUT HOW DO WE MAKE IT EASIER FOR SOMEBODY TO HAVE AXES THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IS THE HEART OF YOUR BILL. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN TERMS OF. COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE COUNTRIES- THOSE ACCESS TO ENTRY AS EASILY AS IT IS AVAILABLE. AND EVEN MORE SO YOUNG PEOPLE GET CAUGHT UP WITHOUT CREDIT CARDS WHEN THEY FIRST ENTER A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SETTING I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS AT EAST LA COLLEGE. THE FIRST THING THAT I ENCOUNTER WITH SOMEONE TRYING TO GET ME TO GET A VISA AND BEFORE I. BEFORE I EVEN KNEW IT I WAS ALREADY AND THAT. AND SO BY. NINETEEN MY CREDIT SCORE BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CREDIT AND FINANCIAL LITERACY WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS AVAILABLE IN MY COMMUNITY. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT OF ALL OF THAT MEANT TO MY FUTURE AND MY ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO- RENT AN APARTMENT AT CETERA AND IT TOOK SOME TIME- TO LIKE REBUILD MY CREDIT. SO YEAH I THINK WHAT IT THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND FINANCIAL LITERACY AROUND EQUITY AROUND RESOURCES AROUND. US SYSTEMS THAT DON'T THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY EQUAL TO ALL. IS A LARGER CONVERSATION- IN TERMS OF HOW WE PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD. AND HOW ULTIMATELY WE HELP FAMILIES IT'S NOT. AN END ALL BE ALL LIKE A CREDIT SCORE IS A REFLECTION OF A OF A STAMP IN SOMEONE'S LIFE IT IS NOT A REFLECTION OF THEIR WHOLE LIFE. BUT WE USE THESE REPORTS TO KIND OF PAINT A PICTURE WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD OR IN BETWEEN. AND ULTIMATELY THERE ARE FAMILIES OUT THERE STRUGGLING THAT SIMPLY NEED AN OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH. AND GOVERNMENT SO JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT FOR THE RECORD I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. MISS QUIRK-SILVA- AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING IN THE SPACE- QUITE A BIT THIS BILL DOES BRING UP A LITTLE BIT OF- MIXED FEELINGS BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND OF COURSE I WANT TO SEE PEOPLE AND THIS BEST THIS PARTICULAR GROUP THAT ALREADY HAS IF YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT YOUR IN THEIR HAND I WOULD NOTE THAT SOMEBODY THAT ACTUALLY GETS INTO A VOUCHER IN THEIR HAND- THEY'VE GONE THROUGH A- MANY TIMES YEARS OF BEING ON A LIST TO GET THIS PARTICULAR VOUCHER. AND VETTING IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GO TO SOCIAL SERVICES AND THEY'RE JUST HANDING THEM OUT NO THERE IS A VERY LENGTHY PROCESS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IN THIS IS WHERE I MEAN SOMETIMES WE'RE WE'RE DOING THIS AT THE DIETS BUT SOMETIMES THERE THERE ARE THE UNINTENDED QUAN CONSEQUENCES IN THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- YOU MENTIONED- WHICH IS IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A CREDIT. REPORT THEY'RE GOING TO USE SOMETHING ELSE. AND IS THAT IN TURN GOING TO BE THE SAME BARRIER WHICH IS WE KNOW IF YOU PULL A BANKING RECORDS FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S REALLY IN A VULNERABLE POPULATION THEY MAY NOT EVEN USE A TRADITIONAL BANKS. WE KNOW THAT THEY MAY NOT- HAVE A CREDIT AS WE SAID CREDIT CARDS. BECAUSE THEY MAY BE MONTH TO MONTH HAVING LITERALLY AS WE KNOW SOME FOLKS. THAT AREN'T DISABILITY THEY LITERALLY GET ELEVEN HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MAYBE FOURTEEN HUNDRED- A MONTH. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A THOUSAND DOLLAR SAVINGS SO THIS IS REALLY KIND OF A PUSH AND PULL BETWEEN PROTECTING THE INVESTORS. WHO ARE WHETHER THEY'RE- SMALL INVESTORS ARE LARGER INVESTORS. APARTMENT RENTALS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE SOME TYPE OF PROTECTION BUT ALSO GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY- FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO HAVE A VOUCHER NEED TO USE IT AND I WILL DID WAS VERY STRUCK BY THAT. A REPORT FROM THE SIDE BELIEVE IT WAS A SACRAMENTO BEE- THAT CAME OUT MAYBE A MONTH AGO ABOUT THIS INDIVIDUAL WHO LITERALLY HAS A VOUCHER IN THEIR HAND AND CANNOT USE IT IN REMAINS HOMELESS AND THAT'S ONE STORY. SO I'M DOING A LOT OF SPEAKING HERE BUT IT IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN TWO. TWO EMERGING GROUPS AND HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT SO I AM. LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY I'LL KEEP LISTENING AND- YOU KNOW BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE IN THE SPACE WANTING TO SEE PEOPLE HOUSED. BUT ALSO KNOWING THE REALITIES THAT IF ONE GROUP- IS GOING TO LET SOMEBODY INTO THAT UNIT AND THEY CAN'T USE A CREDIT REPORT THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ANOTHER WAY IN IS THAT GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN HARDER. NO I AGREE WITH YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA- BUT RIGHT NOW. APPLICANTS ARE BEING ASKED FOR A CREDIT REPORT AND OTHER. RECORDS IT'S NOT EITHER OR- RIGHT AND TODAY RIGHT. CREDIT THAT HAVE TO PAY A FEE FOR THE CREDIT REPORT THEY GET IT THE CREDIT THE LANDLORD GETS THE CREDIT REPORT. BANK RECORDS HE'LL LOOK AT THE WHOLE PROCESS IT'S NOT. CHOOSE A OR B. RIGHT I'M SO IT IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW BUT THIS BILL IS ONLY FOCUSED ON THE CREDIT REPORT AND THE FEE. RIGHT AND WE DID NOT INCLUDE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT A LANDLORD CAN USE TO MAKE A DECISION. RIGHT TO WORK WE'RE WE'RE OF TARGETING- SO THERE'S STILL OTHER PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT THE LANDLORD TIME OR OR PERSON OWNING THE PROPERTY. IT'S LIKE YOU MENTIONED THE SAXBY STORY. OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT. HAD A HOUSING VOUCHER IN HAND AND COULDN'T. FIND A PLACE AND SPENT YOU TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE CREDIT REPORT FEE. EIGHT AND THIS IS JUST ONE WAY. TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MISTER CALLER IN THE MISTER WARD. THANK YOU- YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS A RUN A CRISIS AND A CRISIS- IS LEADING TO A LOT OF PAIN AND SUFFERING- AND WE NEED TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND THE REALITY IS AS A SUMMER QUIRK-SILVA INDICATED FOR SOMEONE ALREADY HAVE ULTRA QUALIFY FOR SOME KIND OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY. THEY'VE GONE THROUGH SO MANY HOOPS AND- IF YOU'RE GOING TO REQUIRE SOMETHING OF THOSE APPLYING TO A BRAND YOU HAVE TO APPLY TO EVERYONE YOU CAN'T. DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VOUCHER AND SO YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS THAT. THERE IS A PUT I MEAN I THINK A- SOMEONE RENTING A PROPERTY I THINK THEY CAN PRESUME THAT SOMEONE WHO QUALIFIES. FOR A VOUCHER. QUALIFIES FOR A REASON. MY FATHER FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS BEEN RUNNING OUT HOME TO SOMEONE ON SECTION EIGHT. I'M A GREAT FAMILY THAT TEN YEARS AGO COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN INTO THAT HOME IF IT RELIED UPON THE OTHER TRADITIONAL THINGS YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT. WHAT IS YOU GET OUT OF IT HE RENTS ARE BELOW MARKET HE GOES GOOD GIVING IT TO A FAMILY. THAT NEEDS IT BUT HE ALSO GETS FOR ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF APPROXIMATELY OF THAT MONEY EVERY A VERY REGULAR CHECK. FROM THE GOVERNMENT HE DOES LEAVE AT THE VERY LEAST IS THAT STABILITY THERE AND THEN THE FAMILY HAS COME UP WITH THE REST OF. THE DAY. YOU KNOW IF HE WAS GONNA SHOOT THAT FAMILY LIKE ANY OTHER PERSON THE PRIVATE MARKET COMING IN THERE'S NO WAY THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AT HOME SO WHY DO WE CREATE THESE PROGRAMS. THE BRIDGE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO STOCK ON THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY TO ACTUALLY USE VOUCHERS OVER PAYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NATIONALLY FOR. EVEN HER STATE ALONE WE SPEND SO MUCH MONEY BUT AND YET THE PROBLEM WE WONDER WHY THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. AND IS BECAUSE THE BARRIERS ASK STOCK UPON THE CUMULATIVE. AND SO ULTIMATELY WHAT IS THAT INFORMATION TELL YOU THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW BY THE FACT THAT SOMEONE HAS QUALIFIED FOR A VOUCHER. YOU KNOW THAT THEY IF THEY HAD THE VOUCHER THAT. IS GOOD THAT IS FOR A REASON AND AT THE END THAT WERE COMING TOGETHER AS A SOCIETY AND SAYING AS A PUBLIC POLICY MATTERS. THAT WE'RE GOING TO COMBINE SOME OF OUR MONEY. AS A SOCIETY. AND HOW OUT THIS MAY. THAT I. WE'RE PAYING A LOT MORE AS A- TO HAVE THEM HOMELESS OR ON THE VERGE OF HOMELESSNESS. AND SO IT DOESN'T IMPACT THE ABILITY FOR THAT PERSON. OR THAT THAT FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO PAY RENT. OR DOESN'T GET THE IN THE CREDIT SCORE BY ITSELF DOES NOT GIVE THE INDICATION. OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT PERSON TO BE ABLE TO PAY RENT. IF YOU'RE ADDING IT WITH THIS VOUCHER THE SUBS IF THEY HAVE. A IS IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T GIVE. AN ACTUAL PICTURE OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT. BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT'S ALREADY DONE THAT RISK ASSESSMENT. FOR YOU. AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY LOOK YOU KNOW- WE HAVE TO. IT IS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT. KIND OF COMPETING INTERESTS SOME EXTENDED END OF THE DAY THE POP OF THE PUBLIC POLICY NEEDS. OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS. DICTATES THAT WE DO HAVE A SOMETIMES PICK SIDES. AND ATM. AND THE FACT THAT. IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IT JUST WE'RE GOING TO SEE IT AS AN EVEN BATTLE- IN AND I HATE TO USE WOULD BATTLE BUT EVEN COMPETING INTERESTS. THAN THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMES ARE ALWAYS GOING TO LOSE OUT THE POT THE POOR. THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY ARE ALWAYS GONNA LOSE. IN THE BACK OF IT IN THAT EQUATION. AND WE HAVE TO DO. MORE THAN WE'VE BEEN DOING TO MAKE IT JUST A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR SOME. OF THESE FAMILIES TO GET A TO GET INTO HOUSES. THANK YOU. MR WARD. THANK YOU- I- GIVEN THIS BILL. BIT OF STUDY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING IN FOR IT- I RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE'RE TRYING TO BE FAIR IN AND HOW WE GO ABOUT MAKING OUR RENTAL DECISIONS. ON THAT WE WANT- YOU KNOW BUT WE WANT TO BE FAIR IN IN IN ALL OF OUR TOOLS ARE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. AND SO- ON ONE HAND I WAS THINKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW IF. WE DON'T WANT TO DISCRIMINATE BASED ON THE FORM- SOURCES OF INCOME OR WHETHER THAT IS BALLOTS OR OTHER OR OTHERWISE- AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO COMPARE APPLICANT APPLICANT IT'S NICE TO HAVE A FULL SET A FULL COMPLEMENT OF RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO A FAIR. AND FULL COMPARISON- BUT I DO SIDE WITH MINE I'M CALLING FROM SAN JOSE RAISES LIKE. THE EXACTLY THE RIGHT POINTS THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALSO- BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF SCREENING A LOT OF. TIME TO BE ABLE TO EVEN QUALIFY FOR SOMETHING IN THE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO YOU KNOW THE MONEY IS THERE YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE YOU'RE GOING TO BE MADE WHOLE- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS MOVE FOR TODAY MOSTLY BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER- IMPORTANT AND HELPFUL LEGISLATION IT'S ALSO MOTION. MOTION THIS COULD BE A REALLY GOOD TOOL- ARE CALLING FROM ORANGE COUNTY HAS A REALLY GOOD TOOL IN MOTION I'M WORKING ON REUSABLE SCREENING- REPORTS AS WELL THAT YOU KNOW SOMEHOW BETWEEN ALL THESE ACTUALLY MIGHT BE- SYMBIOTIC. OR OR OR OR WORK OUT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE HORRIBLY BURNED RIGHT NOW- AND ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND I MEAN SHUT OUT OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES- AND I WANT TO AND I WANT TO. GET THERE WITH YOU- ENCOURAGED TO HEAR- THERE WAS TESTIMONY TODAY THAT ORGANIZATIONS ARE ARE WORKING. WITH MY OFFICE I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET- BUT I'M MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS- SO I THINK- ANTENNA MIGHT I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE- SO THAT WE CAN ALL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS- COMPLEMENT. OF BILLS TOGETHER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH YOU ON THAT ALL THE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER SAID. THANK APART SO YEAH THIS IS A I THINK I A BANDAID TWO OF A LARGER PROBLEM WE ALL KNOW THE LARGER PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FIFTY PEOPLE ONE APPLY FOR ONE APARTMENT AND HALF OF THEM MIGHT HAVE VOUCHERS OF. YOU KNOW WITH A WHOLE RANGE OF A 50% OR A 100% OR WHATEVER AND SO THAT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT BUT A LOT OF ALL THE LANDOWNERS OUT THERE THE CORPORATIONS THEY'RE NOT ALL THE HUGE APARTMENT BUILDINGS THERE LOT OF MOM AND POP FOLKS THAT OWN HAVE OVER THEIR YEARS- BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR PROPERTIES. AND THOSE PROPERTIES ARE THEIR LIFELINE THAT'S THEIR INCOME AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT INCOME AND THEY DON'T HAVE A GUARANTEE OF THAT INCOME- DAN THEY TURN INTO PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING TRYING TO- YOU KNOW DO EXACTLY WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE. AND THEY DO USE THESE TOOLS AND THAT'S ONE OF THEIR TOOLS IS DOING A CREDIT REPORT AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS RELY JUST ON THAT CREDIT REPORT THAT'S KIND OF A SNAPSHOT OF THE OVERALL HISTORY BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT. GATHERING SOME OF THE DAY AND THERE'S NOT AS MUCH DATA AS THEY NEED BEFORE IF THEY DON'T HAVE A CREDIT REPORT THEN THEY'RE GONNA WANT A BUNCH OF THESE OTHER THINGS BUT IF THEY HAVE A CREDIT REPORT THAT SAYS THAT THIS IS KINDA IFFY ON THE CREDIT REPORT BUT BOY THEY'VE HAD A GREAT JOB FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. THEY'RE MAKING UP FOR IT OVER HERE AND THAT BALANCES IT OUT AND THAT HELPS BRING THAT SECURITY TO A INDIVIDUAL LANDLORDS- THAT HAS DON'T DOESN'T HAVE THE ROOM TO HAVE SOMEBODY NOT PAY HALF THE RENT AND THEN TAKE ANOTHER SIX MONTHS. TO EVICTING AND TRY OR NOT BE ABLE TO VICTOR ALL AND JUST HAVE TO EAT IT- THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY THEY DON'T HAVE THAT DATA THAT TO ABILITY- SO- I. IT'S A TWO THAT. IS NECESSARY FOR SOME. AND IT'S USEFUL FOR SOME BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS RELIED ON AND I WOULD I WOULD HESITATE TO TAKE IT AWAY. AND SAY. WE'RE NOT GONNA ALLOW CREDIT REPORTS- IT NO MATTER WHO IT IS WHETHER IT'S A SUBSIDIES OR IT'S A NON SUBSIDIZED PERSON- THOSE CREDIT REPORTS ARE PART OF THE TOOLS FOR ESPECIALLY SMALLER- LANDLORDS TO BE ABLE TO. ENSURE THEIR SURVIVABILITY AND- AND THEY DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY THEY HAVE A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT THIS HELPS THE I THINK THINGS LIKE THIS WILL. ENCOURAGE THEM NOT TO BE AS FLEXIBLE. BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE TOOLS THEY NEED AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE SAFE PLACE AND THAT SAFE PLACE ISN'T ALWAYS SOMEBODY HAS A SUBSIDY. AND DOES SO THAT THAT WORRIES ME IN THAT RESPECT AND THE YOU KNOW THE BY MY LAST COMMENT IS. THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS WE HAVE FALLEN WOEFULLY WOEFULLY BEHIND. IN IN BUILDING. HOMES IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER THEIR APARTMENTS TOWNHOMES SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WHATEVER AND IN THAT PROCESS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS AND- WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING IT IN A MANNER THAT WILL SPEED DATA. OR MAKE THAT BETTER AND THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUS IS BECAUSE IF WE CAN GET IT TO ONE PERSON HAS- YOU HAVE FIVE PEOPLE APPLYING FOR AN APARTMENT INSTEAD OF FIFTY. FIVE I THINK A LOT OF THESE ISSUES KIND OF WRITE THEMSELVES IN THE MARKET IT JUST'S TO WHAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD IN THEIR VOUCHERS CAN COVER BUT IF IT'S ANYTHING LESS THAN A 100% EIGHT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR LANDLORDS TO GET BEHIND THAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO ENSURE THAT SOMEBODY IS FINANCIALLY CAPABLE TO KEEP. KEEP THEM SURVIVING. THANK YOU I AGREE WITH. SOME OF WHAT YOU SAID RIGHT WE ARE NOT TARGETING ALSO SOME- AND- YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT- BUT- THIS LIKE I SAID IT'S VERY NARROW- IT'S SOMEONE WITH A VOUCHER. THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET. THE SOME OF THE RENT OR MOST OF THE RENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT. RIGHT I I'M A LANDLORD I'M A VERY SMALL I HAVE ONE UNIT- I RELY ON THAT INCOME GREAT AND DOT OF UNFORTUNATELY DURING OPEN. THEY WERE ABLE TO PAY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A VOUCHER SO I WASN'T GETTING PAID- BUT IN THIS CASE- THIS IS SOMEONE THAT IS APPLYING LIKE THE MEMBER FROM ORANGE COUNTY SAID. THEY'RE NOT JUST HANDING THEM OUT AT THE SOCIAL SERVICES CENTER RIGHT YOU GO THROUGH VETTING- AN APPLICATION PROCESS TO EVEN QUALIFY AND HOPEFULLY GET THAT VOUCHERS SO THEY'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH HOOPS. TO EVEN GET THAT VOUCHER IN THEIR HAND AND THIS BILL IS ONLY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THOSE HOOPS AND HAVE THAT VOUCHER IN HAND IT IS FOR NO ONE ELSE. RIGHT SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT BRINGING THE BILL FORD AND THE CONVERSATION ON THE DIRE CITY WE'VE DISCUSSED A NUMBER OF THINGS AND ALWAYS HAPPY TO HEAR DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ON THESE BILLS- YOU'RE TRYING TO TACKLE TOUGH ISSUE- BUT IT'S ADMIRABLE AND THAT THESE ARE FOLKS THAT NEED HELP THE MOST. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HERE IS A CREDIT REPORTED MEANINGFUL PREDICTOR OF SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO PAY WHEN. THEY HAVE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS RIGHT IN THAT SENSE I DON'T THINK THE CREDIT REPORT IS A MEANINGFUL PREDICTOR OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY I THINK THE SUBSIDIES MEANING. MEANINGFUL PREDICTOR OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY BUT I ALSO HEAR THE QUESTION UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BUT I WANT TO SEE THE BILL MOVE FORWARD- OUT OF MY COMMITTEE BECAUSE I TINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE- I'D- ARE WE WERE LOOKING FOR MOTION AND- SO MOVED SECOND. OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THIS CONVERSATION R. LIKE I SAID THIS IS A VERY. NARROW YOU KNOW BARRIER THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND NOT. ANY BILL THAT WE BRING FORWARD IS NOT SOLVING. OUR HOUSING CRISIS RAY AND BUT IF WERE ABLE TO HELP SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY. QUALIFIED FOR A HOUSING VOUCHER AND HAVE IT IN HAND AND WANT TO BE HOUSED- THEN THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD DO THIS AND I ASK THAT. YOU WOULD YOU ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE AND LET'S CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AND- AND- YOU KNOW BY VOTING FOR IT TODAY YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR ALL THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE ALREADY- SUPPORTED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT ON THIS- AND I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN JUDICIARY WICKS FIVE. I SEYARTO SAY ARE NO CARILLO. HI GABRIEL. KALRA KALRA I. KILEY QUIRK-SILVA. WARD OR DIE. THE BILL DOES NOT PASS- IT'S ON CALL I'M SORRY WE'VE GOT A COUPLE KILEY ABOUT SOUTH KOREAN ARE. GIVE. LET'S GO NOW TO MISTER JONES SAWYER. YOUR BRING. CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY THREE THE BAND THE BOX HOUSING ACT I LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND I'M ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT THE NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS. CALIFORNIANS WITH A CRIMINAL HISTORY ARE CONSTANTLY MARC WITH THE SCARLET LETTER THAT BLOCKS THEM FROM GETTING THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK AND REUNITING WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. THIS BILL WILL BAN THE BOX PREVENTING RENTERS FROM INCLUDING QUESTIONS REGARDING AN APPLICANT'S CRIMINAL HISTORY ON THE INITIAL ROUND OF APPLICATIONS WHILE SEEKING HOUSING. AS IT STANDS TODAY WE PUNISH THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED INCARCERATION FOR BEING HONEST ABOUT THEIR PAST WHEN TRYING TO SECURE HOUSING AT A TIME WHEN OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. SPECIFIC TERROR FORMALLY INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TERM AND PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY- INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR 61% REPORT DIFFICULTY FINDING HOUSING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE RATE OF OTHERS. HERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE FIRSTLY MOST HOUSING APPLICATION HAPPY AND OFTEN FORMALLY INCARCERATED FOLKS ARE HAVING TO SHELL OUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FIFTY DOLLARS EVEN A HUNDRED DOLLARS ONLY TO HAVE APPLICATION THROWN INTO THE TRASH. BECAUSE OF THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD EVEN WORSE FORMALLY INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS FACE CRIME FREE HOUSING POLICIES THAT EMPOWER RENTERS TO EXCLUDE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVED POPULATION FROM NEIGHBORHOODS WITH ACCESS TO BETTER SCHOOLS AND OPPORTUNITIES. ACCORDING TO THE LOS ANGELES TIMES ARTICLE SOME LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS OFFER TRAINEE TO RENTERS OR HOW TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A FORMERLY INCARCERATED WITHOUT SUFFERING LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. I'M OFFERING AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY THREE TO GIVE FORMERLY INCARCERATED A PATH TO LOOK TO LIFE SUSTAINING HOUSING WHILE. THANKS TO THE WORK OF COMMUNIQU OF THIS OF THE COMMITTEE- THIS BILL BUILDS ON AN ALREADY EXISTING REGULATIONS ADOPTED LAST YEAR BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CARE- EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. THE BILL PROVIDES NECESSARY CLARITY FOR RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS OF THEIR OBLIGATION UNDER THESE REGULATIONS THIS BILL WOULD NOT PREVENT OWNERS FROM REQUESTING A BACKGROUND CHECK. REQUIRED THAT AN OWNER PRESENTED IN DETAIL THE FINDINGS OF A BACKGROUND CHECK THEY DEEM SUFFICIENT FOR DENIAL WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF RECEIPT. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL GRANT APPLICANTS THREE DAYS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING EVIDENCE OF REHABILITATION REFERENCES AND OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION. MY BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT SOMEONE'S PAST DOES NOT UNDULY IMPEDE HIS OR HER FUTURE WHILE MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO PROMOTE EQUITY IN THE HOUSE IN SPACE. MANY BERRIES REMAIN ESPECIALLY BARRIERS THAT HINDER THE ABILITY OF THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED TO FIND HOUSING. IF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE A STAT OF SECOND CHANCES PERFORMING INCARCERATED WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO GIVE THEM A FAIR SHAKE AND THE ALREADY UPHILL BATTLE OF INSURING HOUSING CALIFORNIA. AS BY NOON YES AND I BELIEVE MANUAL GOLF GOMEZ OF ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION COALITION ONE OF THE COSPONSORED BY JOINING ME TODAY. THE PROVIDES TESTIMONY I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU AND I THINK WE HAVE A PRIMARY WITNESS MANUAL GOMEZ ON THE PHONE OPERATOR. PARDON ME MISTER GOMEZ IF YOU ARE CALLED IN AS A CO HOST FOR THE CALL YOUR LINE SHOULD BE OPEN. IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT MR GOMEZ HAS DIALED THEN AS A- A SPEAKER ON THE COLD TO JUST A MOMENT. WHAT WHY DON'T WE GO TO OUR WITH THE WITNESS HERE IN THE ROOM WE'LL DO THAT FIRST AND MR GONNA COME AS IF YOU'RE LISTENING PLEASE DIAL IN FOR AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY THREE TO BE A PRIME PRIMARY WITNESS AFTER WE HEAR FROM. A TESTIMONY HERE. A GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HI MY NAME IS AS FUNNY AS AND I'M HERE WITH ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. APOLOGIZE I HAVE WORKED IN ADVOCACY AND DIRECT SERVICES- FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE I'M AT THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION SINCE MY RELEASE. FROM INCARCERATION OF IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND- THE INADVERTENT CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DO NOT PROPERLY HOUSE. INDIVIDUALS COMING HOME. HOUSING IS A FUNDAMENTAL NEED FOR EVERYONE AND CONSIDERING FORMALLY INCARCERATE PEOPLE ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE HOMELESS WE ARE NO DIFFERENT. A. R. C. IS ACUTELY AWARE OF WHAT PEOPLE RETURNING HOME NEED TO SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY. AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMMUNITIES IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. STILL IT BECOMES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO WITHOUT ACCESS TO STABLE HOUSING. SOMEONE COULD NOT BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT EDUCATION WORK OR FAMILY REUNIFICATION IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WILL BE LAYING THEIR HEADS IN A DAY. A WEEK. OR A MONTH FROM NOW. SHE HAS MET HAVE MEMBERS THAT HAVE TAKEN PART IN OUR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SERVICES. AND WE PROVIDED THEM THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO FIND THEIR FOOTING. THEY FIND QUALITY JOBS AND CAREERS WHILE BEING ABLE TO SAVE MONEY. THEY'RE IN SCHOOL AND THEY'RE ABLE TO RECONNECT WITH THEIR FAMILIES YET WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THEM TO HAVE THEIR OWN HOUSING THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO WHAT THEN. DO THEY GO TO THE STREETS. DO THEY RETURN TO A COMMUNITY THAT IS DEEMED UNSAFE OR UNHEALTHY FOR THEIR PROGRESS. ALL OF THEIR UPWARD MOMENTUM IS SUDDENLY STIFLED. AND AT RISK OF REVERTING BACK TO SURVIVAL MODE CHANCE FIRST TO BE SEEN FOR WHO THEY ARE NOW NOT FOR WHO THEY WERE WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR OFFENSE. AND IT ALLOWS THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND FIND INDEPENDENCE. THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS THE RESULT OF YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS YEARS THAT PEOPLE RETURNING HOME FRANKLY DON'T HAVE. THIS BILL ALLOWS LANDLORDS T KEEP THEIR TIME TO ME THEY STILL GET TO SEE APPLICANTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION CREDIT HISTORY AND LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION. EVERYTHING ONE WOULD NEED TO DETERMINE IF SOMEBODY WOULD MAKE A GOOD AND RELIABLE TENANT. IF AFTER CONSIDERING ALL THOSE FACTORS THEY STILL WANT TO RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO. BUT THEY MUST ADHERE TO THE REGULATIONS ENACTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. ONE OF WHICH IS NOTABLY THE SEVEN YEAR LOOK BACK PERIOD. PEOPLE WHO WERE CONVICTED OVER SEVEN YEARS AGO HAVE PUT IN THE WORK TO REHABILITATE YET BECAUSE A QUESTION IS POSED THERE OFTEN TIMES OVERLOOKED. THEY HAVE THE LOWEST RECIDIVISM RATES AND THOSE RATES DROP EVEN FURTHER WHEN THEY HAVE STABLE HOUSING. SO BY DISALLOWING LANDLORDS TO ASK ABOUT SOMEONE'S CRIMINAL HISTORY ON THEIR APPLICATION THIS BILL ENSURES THAT APPLICANTS WHO ARE UNLIKELY TO KNOW ABOUT THE REGULATIONS ARE COMPELLED TO GIVE LANDLORDS INFORMATION THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE INSIGHT TO. ALLOWS THEM THE DIGNITY AND ABILITY TO APPLY FAIRLY WITHOUT JUDGEMENT OR SHAME. THEY ARE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND IF WE BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES AND BELIEVE IN FORGIVENESS THEN WE MUST CREATE POLICIES THAT REFLECT SUCH. FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE DESERVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE HEALTHY AND STABLE LIVES AS RESIDENTS RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. I URGE IN A VOTE FOR THIS FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU AN OPERATOR DO WE HAVE MANUAL GOMEZ NOW ON THE PHONE AS A PRIMARY WITNESS. EMELEC. PLEASE GO AHEAD.

SO I'M A LITTLE STRUGGLING WITH THIS- NUMBER ONE AND I MAKE NO IS A SMALL VERY SMALL JUST LIKE- MISS QUIRK-SILVA VERY SMALL LANDLORDS. SINGLE UNIT. I RUN BACKGROUND CHECKS THEY'RE EASILY AVAILABLE ON. THINGS AYE WHITE PAGES PREMIUM- YOU CAN GET CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ANYBODY AND I DO THAT WHEN THEIR PEOPLE ARE COMING TO DO WORK AT THE HOUSE TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU HAVE. READ IT AND I DON'T USE THAT NECESSARILY AGAINST THEM BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE RENTAL PART OF IT SINCE I HAVE A IT TAKES MORE OF A TOWN HOME AND YOU HAVE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND IT. AND YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHO MOVES IN. AND SO YOU KNOW I WILL I YOU KNOW WILL HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION AND IT'S I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE THAT OPEN DISCUSSION. BEFORE THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DOING AN APPLICATION FEE AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS AND THEN FIND THAT THE LANDLORD IS TOTALLY INTOLERANT. OF SOME OF THE OFFENSES THAT THEY DO BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT MAY NOT BE INTOLERANT OF SOME. THEY CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SAY ADDED LEARN THEIR LESSON THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT ANYMORE BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE THE YOU HAVE TO STRUGGLE AS A LANDLORD. AT TO SAY OKAY YOU KNOW I'M GONNA TAKE A CHANCE ON THIS AND SOME OF THOSE ARE- PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR DRUG DEALING- BECAUSE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE ASSOCIATION WILL. CERTAINLY HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE FOR- YOU KNOW CHILD MOLESTATION THOSE TYPE OF THINGS- AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. YOU LOOK FOR SOME OF THOSE BECAUSE OF THAT START HAPPENING IN THE UNIT YOU'RE RENTING- THE BUCK STOPS ON YOU. SO AS A LANDLORD I'D RATHER HAVE THAT CONVERSATION UP FRONT. AND I KNOW NOT ALL ARE IS MAYBE OPEN MINDED TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND NOT- NOT. IMMEDIATELY DISMISS SOMEBODY BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WE DO NEED PEOPLE THAT WANT TO REHABILITATE REHABILITATE THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. AND IF YOU CAN BE HELPFUL ALONG THAT PATH THAT'S AWESOME- BUT YOU STILL NEED. IT FOR ME YOU NEED TO HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO THAT. AND IN TAKING AWAY TOOL AND HAVING IT COME LATER IN THE PROCESS. TO FIND A PLACE THAT WHERE THEY ARE TOLERANT OF WHATEVER IT IS THAT IS ON THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA FIND IT ANYWAY. SO NOW I HAVE TO ORDER ONE. SO THAT'S WHY MAN AND OPPOSETHE BILL IS BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK. IT'S GOING TO BE USEFUL- AND THAT PLANNERS CAN ALREADY GET IT THAT DOESN'T THEY DON'T HAVE TO ORDER ONE UP FROM FROM THAT. THE TENANT. AND IT AND I WISH. THAT MMHM MOST LANDLORDS WOULD. WOULD TAKE THE TIME. AND EFFORT TO REALLY LOOK AT SOMEONE. THAT PERSON. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THEY CHECKED THAT BOX. IN A SEAT. PERFORMING CARCERI. THROW THROW IT AWAY. YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE GANDHI. MARTIN LUTHER KING AND OTHERS WHO HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS pWELL YOU KNOW WHO HE IS NOW BUT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM THAT OPPORTUNITY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SAY GIVE ME OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW YOU THAT ARE NOT ONLY HAVE I DONE MY TIME AND PAID MY DEBT TO SOCIETY BUT I MIGHT BE. A MAILER TO TRADE MAKE IT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR I NOW HAVE A GOOD I DON'T OR BRING UP THE PREVIOUS RIGHT NOW FOR GOOD CREDIT RECORD OVER SEVEN YEARS I'D I NOW CAN PAY MY BILLS AND MAKE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE OTHER FACTORS. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT MY CRIMINAL PAST AND I JUST THINK SECOND CHANCES ARE IMPORTANT- I GREW UP WHERE MY GRANDMOTHER'S USED TO SAY YOU CAN YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION. UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S A LOT OF TIMES THE WAY THINGS ARE SOCIETY. THIS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE FORMERLY INCARCERATED. AGAIN WHO WOULDN'T. PAGE ASSIST THEIR PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND NOW ARE PROBABLY SAFER THAN SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER GONE TO PRISON WE NEED WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THAT SECOND CHANCE THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

HOWEVER AMBIGUITIES IN THE LAW HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED TO DE RAIL DESPERATELY NEEDED HOUSING PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY EIGHT MAKES ONE CLARIFYING CHANGE TO ADDRESS AN EMERGENT LOOPHOLE IT CLARIFIES THAT IF A PROJECT APPLICATION HAS ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT MEETS THE OBJECTIVE STANDARDS.

OR DIE ISRAEL THREE I AND THE BILL EIGHT ZERO OKAY THAT'S OUT EIGHT ZERO THANK YOU THREE FOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS. MADAM CHAIR WHEN YOU ARE READY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND THE STAFF. I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMONS OUTLINE OF THE ANALYSIS TODAY ON A. B. TWO THREE THREE FOUR CALIFORNIA AS WE ALL KNOW- CURRENTLY HAS A GAP OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION HOMES- THAT WE ARE THAT AS A GAP OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION HOMES- FOR STRUGGLING THAT WE AFFORDABLE HOMES THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO FIND- WITH ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HOMELESS ON THE STREETS AT ANY GIVEN NIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA MANY OF US SEE THAT ON OUR STREETS AS WE GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICT AND IT'S IN EVERY COMMUNITY- ACROSS THE STATE. WELL THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BEAR TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A LACK OF PUBLIC FUNDING LAND USE POLICY ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF UNITS THAT CAN BE BUILT HERE IN CALIFORNIA A. B. NINETY S. R. IN IN TWENTY NINETEEN AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE BY FORMER CHAIR CHIU AMENDED STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW TO ALLOW 41100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS UNLIMITED DENSITY FOR DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN ONE HALF MILE OF A MAJOR TRANSIT STOP OR HIGH QUALITY BUS CORRIDOR. THAT BILL PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WITH UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT A. B. TWO TWENTY THREE THIRTY FOUR BUILT ON RECENT IMPROVEMENTS TO AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE BY ALLOWING A 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TO RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE FROM THE LOCAL AGENCY ADDED HEIGHT AND DENSITY OF THE PROJECT IS LOCATED IN URBANIZED LOW V. M. T. AREA. THE BILL DEFINES A LOW BEAM TEARY AS AN URBANIZED AREA WHERE THE EXISTING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT GENERATES VMT PER CAPITAL PER CAPITA THAT IS BELOW PER CAPITA OR CITY VMT PER CAPITA. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WILL BE RELEASING MAPS WITH REGIONAL BMP CALCULATIONS AT THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING. ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL IN THE COMING MONTHS. THESE MAPS ARE BASED ON LOCAL TRAVEL DEMANDS MODELED. MODELS DEVELOPED BY JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE PRODUCED THEIR OWN MAPS VMT THE BILL DRESSES THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT FURTHER. THAT FURTHERS ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY GOALS BY INCREASING THE UNIVERSE OF SITES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. ALL OF MY WITNESSES HERE SELF IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AND LOOKING FOR SUPPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE. YOU. YOU MAY GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIRED MEMBERS WEARING A WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM WERE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON THE PRODUCTION PRESERVATION OF LOW INCOME HOUSING- THE TWENTY TWENTY TO STATEWIDE HOUSING PLAN SPECIFICALLY LESS AS AN OBJECTIVE OF THE STATE QUOTE TO ENCOURAGE NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN EXISTING COMMUNITIES TO REDUCE VMT AND MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESSING HOUSING NEEDS. AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY FOUR DOES BOTH BY STRENGTHENING DENSITY BONE AT THE DENSITY BONUS PROVISION AT THAT MS WEEKS JUST ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS JUST NOTED THAT CURRENTLY ALLOWS A 100% AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS TO BE BUILT MORE DENSELY AND WITHIN A HALF MILE MAJOR TRANSIT STOP. BY EXPANDING IT TO LOGIN T. AREAS THESE ARE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE AS FAR OR AS MUCH TO GET TO SCHOOL WORK OR OTHER DAILY DESTINATIONS BY ITS VERY DEBT DEFINITION- LOW BM TEAM MEANS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE A LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GHG EMISSIONS. NOT ONLY IS THE REDUCTION A CRITICAL STRATEGY TO ACHIEVING OUR STATE'S CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS IT ALSO PROVIDES OTHER HEALTH EQUITY ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LOVE B. M. T. AREAS IS ASSOCIATE WITH EVEN DEEPER VMT REDUCTIONS BECAUSE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS USE LOCATION. EFFICIENT SPACE MORE EFFICIENTLY. THIS IS A SMART POLICY BILL THAT PROVIDES NO NEW FUNDING OR STREAMLINING OR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO THE DEVELOPERS BUT WHAT DOES IS ALLOW COMMUNITIES THAT WANT MORE HOUSING TO MOVE AHEAD WITH HIGHER DENSITY. DEVELOPMENT IN THE VERY AREAS WHERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS MOST NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO ITS PART. ON BEHALF OF THE ONE MILLION LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS LET CURRENTLY LIVING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE MILLIONS MORE IN DESPERATE NEED OF THIS HOUSING. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. NEXT SO IN THIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M NEVADA MERRIMAN POLICY DIRECTOR AND I'M PLEASED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE THIRTY FOUR O BEHALF OF MID PENN HOUSING CORPORATION AT MID PENN WE OWN MANAGE OVER EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED AFFORDABLE RENTAL APARTMENTS. AND HAVE A PIPELINE OF NEARLY A DISH AN ADDITIONAL FIVE THOUSAND HOMES THROUGHOUT ELEVEN COUNTIES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AND MONTEREY BAY AREA. LAST THURSDAY MID PENN HOUSING BROKE GROUND ON KEY TO CROSSING A TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE UNIT INNOVATIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY. ENVISIONED TO SERVE LOW INCOME FAMILIES PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND OTHER SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS INCLUDING MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THIS COMMUNITY WAS DEVELOPED IN DEEP PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OF SAN MATTEO AS IT IS ON LAND THAT'S OWNED BY THE CITY. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING PREVAILING WAGE JOBS FOR ABOUT FORTY BUILDING TRADES AND MEETING AN AMBITIOUS SUSTAINABILITY GOAL WITH ITS ALL ELECTRIC APPROACH. IT WAS AMONG THE VERY FIRST PROJECTS TO BE ENTITLED USING STATE LAW TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE. SENATOR WAS EXCITED TO UTILIZE THIS NEW ENHANCED DENSITY BONUS AS THEY HAVE A HUGE LOCAL NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOMES. BUT LIMITED SITES THAT ARE UNDER CITY CONTROL TO DEVELOP. SAN MATTEO BROUGHT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MID PENN AND EMBRACE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL AS A TOOL THAT WOULD HELP THEM MAXIMISE SCARCE AND PRECIOUS CITY RESOURCE. THEIR LAND. THE REVISED ENTITLEMENT PACKAGE. WITH A NET OUT OF SIXTY ONE HOMES FOR A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE WAS SUBMITTED AND PROCESSED QUICKLY WITH THE PROCEDURE STILL REQUIRING DISCRETIONARY ACTION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL PROVIDED THEIR UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AND WAS PROUD BEYOND MEASURE FORMER SAN MATTEO MARY JO GOETHALS SAID IN A STATEMENT WE HAVE OVER TWO THOUSAND UNITS IN THE DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE AND WITH THE HOUSE OF COMMUNITY THAT MID PENN THIS BUILDING. WE'RE PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERY INCOME LEVEL. BY EXPANDING THE DENSITY BONUS PROVISION TO LOW V. M. T. AREAS AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW MORE COMMUNITIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CRITICAL TOOL. LIKE CEMETERY DID.

SHE REGISTRY OKAY. OKAY. WELCOME THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN- OFF OF BELL AND THE TO THE COMMITTEE I'M I'M SUSAN KIRSCH DIRECTOR OF CATALYST FOR CALIFORNIA FOR CAME FROM HOMELESS FOR LOCAL CONTROL SO I APPRECIATE THIS CHANCE AS MUCH AS I SEE MOST OF YOUR MANY OF YOUR LOOKING AT YOUR CELL PHONES TO BE ABLE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THIS BILL AND WITH APPRECIATION THAT ALL OF US ARE WORKING SO HARD TO BE ABLE TO FIND WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN TRULY FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ESPECIALLY WHO ARE WAGE EARNERS OR WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CAPACITY WAIT TO. EARN WAGES SO I STARTED OUT IN LOOKING AT THIS BILL LOOKING AT THE PART OF THE STAFF REPORT THAT SAID THIS IS BUILT ON THREE PREVIOUS KIND OF LEGAL ACTIONS AND THE AUTHOR MADE REFERENCE TO AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE WHICH WAS INTO NINETEEN AND IT GOES BACK TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THE FIRST DENSITY BONUS LAW WAS PASTOR INJURED INTRODUCED SO WE NOW HAVE TWENTY FOUR YEARS A DENSITY BONUS LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN TWEAKING THE PROCESS OF CITIES BEING ABLE TO BUILD HOUSING. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED IT AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW WHAT IS THE MEANS WHEREBY WE DO THAT SO WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THESE TWENTY FOUR YEARS WE HAVE INCREASED HOUSING COSTS NCREASE LAND COST INCREASE LABOR COSTS LESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE INCREASED INVESTMENTS COMING IN TO BUILD HOUSING WE HAVE INCREASED HOMELESSNESS AND. OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT GO WITH THAT. TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF. AND WE'RE GETTING ANOTHER BILL WHICH IS CALLING FOR DEVELOPERS TO BE ABLE TO CALL THE SHOTS. IN THE STAFF REPORT THAT IS THE LANGUAGE OF GIVING THE DEVELOPERS THE CHANCE TO NAME WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. IMPACTING YOUR CONSTITUENTS. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE DEVELOPERS ARE ABLE TO DO. GET THE CONCESSIONS AND THE BONUSES AND THOSE BONUSES ARE COMING ON THE BACKS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHERE THE CITY STILL NEED TO PROVIDE THE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS THE EXPANSION COSTS. AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAN ARE THE ONES WHO ARE CALLED ON TO BE ABLE TO FUND THAT EXPENSE. THIS BILL GOES FURTHER INTO DETAILS OF LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT REAL EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE IT GOES INTO THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT HAVE TO BE BUILT AS YOU KNOW AS LOW AS FIVE WHICH MEANS THE- FIVE OR 10% OF THAT MEANS THERE'S REALLY HARDLY ANYTHING COMING. THE H. C. D. REPORT- OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO HOUSING PLAN. IS A VERY SIMPLE LOOK AT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IT IS LOOKING AT A SUPPLY DEMAND PROBLEM AS IF PRODUCTION IS GOING TO BE THE ANSWER TO THAT. IT IS MISSING WHAT MANY MANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND OTHER GROUPS ARE SEEING IN TERMS OF MULTIPLE CAUSES AND MULTIPLE WAYS TO RESOLVE THE HOUSING. AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM SO WITH THAT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO STOP TWEAKING MORE BILLS WE DON'T NEED TWENTY FOUR MORE YEARS OF TWEAKING BILLS LIKE BONUS BILLS. WE NEED DEEPER ANALYSIS OF WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS AND HOW DO WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO FIND THOSE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. SO DO WE HAVE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM THAT WISHES TO REGISTER THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER WEST CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEE MADAM CHAIR JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL WE ARE OPPOSED LESS A MINUTE POSITION WILL FOR THE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO.

TO THREE THREE FOUR. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. VERY GOOD THEN WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF FOLKS HAVE QUESTIONS GO AHEAD. I THINK THIS YEAR AND THANK YOU ARE SURE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- YOU KNOW BUT I KNOW THE TIME AND I WAS ON THE COUNCIL SOUNDS A OFTENTIMES THE RED- YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS WONDER LIKE WALL. WHY IT WHY ISN'T CA- WITH PARTICULAR DEVELOP BUILDING IS DIVIDEND SEASON POSSIBLY COULD ESPECIALLY IN AREAS LIKE IN THERE THERE'S CERTAIN AREAS OR MAKE SENSE. CERTAIN AREAS WHERE IT DOESN'T AND SO I THINK THAT HAVING- THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. BUILD A HIGHER DENSITY IN THE PLACES THAT MAKE SENSE I KNOW PLACES ARE CERTAINLY AND BIGGER CITIES THEY GO TO A VERY INTRICATE. IN A SPECIFIC PLANS AND WHAT HAVE YOU WERE DETERMINES THE CORRIDORS WHERE DOES MAKE THE MOST SENSE BUT SOMETIMES- YOU KNOW THERE THERE THERE ARE STILL OBSTACLES TO AS I THINK THIS LEASE. WHO'S ASKING THE RIGHT. TO BY. INCENTIVE TO. IMPOSE AROUND THSE TRANSIT AREAS WITH THE TO THE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENTS WHAT HAVE YOU AND- TRANSIT NODES WHICH IS AT SUCH A HIGH PRIORITY. I THINK FOR SO MANY COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO. INSURE BUILDING IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND BUILDING AS DENSELY. AS WE CAN AGAIN WHERE IT MAKES SENSE AND NOT JUST **** NILLY. BUT IN IN THE QUARTER IS WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE- AND I LEARN MORE. BOB CAN RECENTLY ABOUT SOME OF THE- CONCERNS FROM FRIENDS OF BUILDING TRADES AND CERTAINLY. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ALSO TO EVER EXTENT POSSIBLE HELP FACILITATE. CONVERSATIONS THAT REGARD I THINK THAT THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING WITH OUR FRIENDS- FROM LABOR IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT. WHEREVER WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE GOOD QUALITY JOBS I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN AN AREA. WHERE WHAT WHERE BOND SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE ESPECIALLY BEEN INSERTED BUT THAT BEING SAID BY HAVING A LOT OF. CONVERSATIONS UP IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANGLES I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT- AND- WE NEED TO HAVE AND SO- YOU KNOW APPRECIATE. THE DAUGHTER BRING IN THE BILL FORWARD- AND YOU KNOW HOW COULD HELP FACILITATE CONVERSATIONS GOING FOR BOTH WITH OUR- HOUSING ADVOCATE COMMUNITY AND BUILDING TRADES AND OTHERS- BUT THAT. MAY HAVE CONCERNS OR OR OR- QUESTIONS. ABOUT IT. A RESIDENT MOTION. THERE NOT BEEN- OPENED YET. DID YOU BOOK OKAY OKAY WE HAVE A BY MISTER A SECOND BY MISCREANTS- I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND I THINK MY QUESTION CAN BE DIRECTED AT ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- I'M A LITTLE HUNG UP ON THE PARKING. SO OF HELP HELP ME ALLEVIATE THAT THAT PROBLEM. YOU SAID YOU HAD EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED UNITS CORRECT SOMETHING LIKE THAT- THAT WAS IN THAT UP BUT- WELL THEN SHECAN COME UP TO. DO YOU ALAUSA QUESTION NOW SO YOU CAN CONSIDER IT. THEY ARE THERE YOU HAVE ESTIMATES OF HOW MNY OF THOSE EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED UNITS THE PEOPLE THAT INHABIT THEM OWN VEHICLES. DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THAT TYPE OF DATA AVAILABLE. SO IT'S DEPENDENT ON THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE SERVING OUR FAMILY PROJECT AND SAN MATTEO IT WOULD BE TYPICAL TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY ONE TO ONE RATIO. OKAY BECAUSE WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS I'VE NEVER BEEN TO ANY APARTMENT COMPLEX WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE VEHICLES SO IF THERE IS A REDUCED AMOUNT OF PARKING THAT NEEDS TO BE- GIVEN TO A ARE ARE SUPPLIED FOR A PART A UNIT- AT YEAH I WOULD I WOULD. BE MORE INCLINED TO AGREE WITH THAT- YES- YOU HAVE A LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE SOMETHING AT. MY I DON'T KNOW I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A BIT THE BILL DOESN'T. CHANGE MUCH IN THE PARKING INCENTIVES OF DENSITY BONUS BILL IT DOES SOME TECHNICAL CHANGES SO THERE IS A CLEAR IS THAT CLEANS UP THE DEFINITION. OF SORT OF THE 100% AFFORDABLE PROJECTS THAT QUALIFY FOR THE EXISTING PARKING BENEFIT AND THEN IT DOES LOWER THE AGE- FOR THE SENIOR PROJECT AT SENIOR FOR DOUBLE PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT THE ALL OF THOSE THAT HAVE LIKE THE LOWER PARKING MINIMUMS MUST ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL NEAR MAJOR TRANSIT OR FOR THE SENIOR PROJECTS HAVE. ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION MODALITY IS CONNECTED TO THE PROJECT THE LIKE A CARRIAGE PARA TRANSIT OPTIONS. YEAH I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT PART OF IT BUT- SO THIS DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE IMPOSITION OF ANY VEHICLE- PARKING RESPECT OUR STANDARDS FOR LOCAL AGENCIES. THERE ARE IT'S A 100% RIGHT OR DOUBLE. IT THE- THE BILL AND THE BILL ITSELF DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT IS ALREADY IN LAW WHICH DOES THE EXISTING WHY DOES HAVE- NO PARKING MINIMUMS FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE WITHIN A HALF MILE TRANSIT. SO FOR IT TWO HUNDRED UNITS IN THE DENSITY BONUS THING IS LIFTED TO UNLIMITED BASICALLY AND THEY BUILD SIX HUNDRED UNITS THEY JUST EXACERBATE THE ISSUE RIGHT THREE TIMES AS MANY. VEHICLE PROBLEM IS WHAT I'M GETTING AT WE NEED SOME PARKING. BECAUSE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY DO PARK. AND IT'S ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND IT'S ALL OVER THE STREETS AND WHEN THE STREETS ARE FILLED WITH CARS. THEN THAT'S A SAFETY ISSUE FOR KIDS THERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE CROSSING THE STREETS- SO IF THE YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE ARE ARE VERY WELL. YOU KNOW. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM BUT- SOMETIMES WE GO A LITTLE TOO FAR AND WHEN WE GO THAT FAR. WE CREATE MORE PROBLEMS THAN THAT THEN- WE ARE TRYING TO- ADDRESS SO. UNDERSTOOD MATT MASSIVE AMOUNT YOU CAN SAY ONE MORE THING. I'M OFTEN- SO I THINK ALSO KIND OF I HEAR I HEAR YOUR CONCERN AND I THINK FREQUENTLY WHERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN THERE'S A PARKING MAXIMUM THAT SAT RIGHT WHICH WOULD PROHIBITA DEVELOPER AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM GOING BEYOND THE MINIMUM. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF AND OF NEVADA WANTS TO PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW FREQUENTLY DID THE DEVELOPER DID EVEN DESPITE THAN THAT. THE BILL THIS IS THE EXISTING LAW MIGHT SAVE AND THERE ARE NO PARKING MINIMUMS. FREQUENTLY A DEVELOPER WILL STILL PROVIDE FAR AND ABOVE THAT MINIMUM BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMMUNITY WHAT THEY KNOW THAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS IN ORDER FOR THE PROJECT TO BE APPROVED. SINCE DENSITY BONUS DOESN'T SORT OF STREAMLINED ACTUAL APPROVAL PROCESS IN THE PROJECT STILL HAS TO BE APPROVED. IF THEY GO TOO FAR. YOU KNOW. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE OTHER CHALLENGES SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S HELPFUL TO YOU TO HEAR FROM YOU LATER ADD. YES THANK YOU- SO IN PRACTICE IN THE ANSWER THAT I GAVE PREVIOUSLY THE ONE TO ONE PARKING RATIO. THIS PRETTY COMMUNITY A MIX OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS SO THE DENSITY BONUS THEY DID ADDITIONAL SIXTY ONE UNITS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD. DID NOT HAVE PARKING BUT THE ORIGINAL UNITS DID. AND IT IS DONE IN AN AREA WHERE THE CITY HAS AN ADJACENT GARAGE SO WE WERE ABLE TO KIND OF LOOK AT OTHER RESOURCES WHERE WE CAN DO SOME SHARED PARKING. AND THEN THAT THE NEW UNITS ARE FOR PRIMARILY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR- THE CITY OF SAN MATTEO HAS MANY INTELLECTUAL AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES WHO TYPICALLY DON'T DRIVE IT THAT IT'S TYPICAL THAT THEY'D NEED ZERO CARS ASSOCIATED BUT THEY DO HAVE AVERY HIGH DEMAND FOR THAT SO BY A LAYERING IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS- YOU CAN CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S MORE SUSTAINABLE THANK YOU. I KNOW DEVELOPER ONCE TOLD ME THAT YOU CAN'T RENT OUT A PARKING LOT. SO SO YEP PARKING LOTS ARE NOT. CONDUCIVE TO A- A PROFITABILITY IN FACT THEY'RE ONE OF THE DRAINS ON BEING ABLE TO BUILD. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A NEED ANALYSTS IF IN ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE DRIVE. GONZALEZ TO IT AND THEY WANT TO DRIVE TO THEIR NET RELATIVE'S HOUSE IN TWO CITIES OVER THERE GONNA DRIVE. AND SO THEY ALL MOST OF THEM HAVE CARDS AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE THAT ACCOMMODATION- AND THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATION SO. ANYWAY I APPRECIATE YOUR GUYS INPUT ON THAT AND- GONNA BRING IT BACK- BELIEVE ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY OTHER ADDITIONS. IF NOT. I WILL ALLOW YOU TO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THANK YOU MEDICARE P. **** THAT QUESTIONS- THE COMMENTS APPRECIATE ART CHAIR OF LABOUR COMMITTEE OFFERING HIS HELP AND- HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR FRIENDS OF THE BUILDING TRADES I WELCOME THOSE I WANT TO WORK WITH. OUR ALLIES THERE- AND HOPEFULLY GET THE NICE STRONG BILL THAT WE CAN ALL SUPPORT. AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THAT THE SECRETARY GO AND CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE- AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HI FREAKS I'D SAY ARE DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW. CARILLO ARE YOU ALL RIGHT GABRIELLE I'M REALLY KALRA. KALRA KILEY. WORKS TO. THANKS TO BUY LORD. FORTY FIVE. COOL. LET ME. ALL RIGHT THAT MAY OUT FIVE ONE. MANY REYES RESET TANK HERO TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN- THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO STAY CLOSE SOME LOOPHOLES THAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED IN THE TENANT PROTECTION ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN ALSO KNOWN BY ITS NUMBER IS AB FOUR CD TWO OF WHICH I WAS A JOINT AUTHOR- AND HELPS AGAIN WITH OUR PREVIOUS CHAIR DAVID CHIU TO GET THAT BILL OVER THE FINISH LINE THAT BILLS A LANDMARK BILL IN THAT IT GAVE EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS PROTECTION AGAINST RENT GOUGING AND FRIVOLOUS. EVICTIONS HOWEVER SINCE ITS IMPLEMENTATION A SERIES OF EVICTIONS HAVE OCCURRED THAT ARE CLEARLY OUTSIDE THE INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL BILL AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO- WE ENUMERATED A NUMBER IN IN THAT BUILDING THAT NEGOTIATION AND IN THE DEAL WE ENUMERATED A NUMBER OF JUSTIFIABLE CAUSES FOR TERMINATION. OF A RENTER'S TENANCY THOSE INCLUDED AT FAULTS CAUSES FOR THINGS LIKE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ON THE PROPERTY. IT ALSO INCLUDED NO FAULT CAUSES WHEN THE TEN IT DID NOTHING WRONG BUT THE PROPERTY OWNER WANTED TO EXERT THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS- AND REALLY THREE MAIN INSTANCES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE ONE WAS- THE MOVER WANTING TO. MOVE THEMSELVES OR A FAMILY MEMBER INTO THE UNIT- THE SECOND IS WANTING TO SUBSTANTIALLY REHABILITATE THE UNIT IN A WAY THAT MADE IT TEMPORARILY. UNINHABITABLE AND THE THIRD IS WANTING TO TAKE THE UNIT OFF THE RENTAL MARKET. WHILE THESE NO FAULT CAUSES BURKE READ TO AS REASONABLE. WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING TO ON THE GROUNDS ON THE GROUND AS PROPERTY OWNERS. EXPLOITING LOOPHOLES BY TERMINATING TENDENCIES FOR THE CAUSES I JUST LISTED BUT NEVER ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THE ACTION. THAT IS THEY GET THE TENTATIVE ACTED BUT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY THEN MOVE IN OR IF THEY MOVE IN ITS FOR. A DAY A WEEK SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE- THEY THEY THAT THERE'S A SENTIMENT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REHABILITATE THE UNIT BUT IT'S NOT A SUBSTANTIVE REHABILITATION- OR THEY SAY THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THAT RENTAL UNIT OFF THE MARKET BUT THEN WEEKS LATER. THEY MOVE MORE TENANTS IN. SO WE NEED TO PUT MORE PARAMETERS AROUND THESE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WERE NOT REALLY DEFINED IS CLEARLY IN THE ORIGINAL BILL AND I WON ALSO SAY WE'RE KEEPING THE CORE TENETS OF THE BILL AND WE HAD VERY GOOD AND I WAS PART OF THEM. NEGOTIATIONS WITH ATTENDED COMMUNITIES WELL AS DEPARTMENT CESSATION AND THE REALTORS- BUT AT THROUGH THE COURSE OF TIME WE REALIZE THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIED- IN THE COURSE OF THAT LANDMARK DEAL THAT WE CREATED AND THAT IS THE GOAL AND INTENT OF THIS BILL. SO THAT'S THE GOAL IS TO REALLY- HELP DEFINE IN MORE SPECIFICITY- A STRONGER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS MEANS- I WELCOME. CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION I THINK WE PRODUCE BETTER. BILLS WHEN WE HAVE DIVERSE CONVERSATION DIVERSE VOICES- AND SO WITH THAT- WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR- WITNESSES TO THIS TO- SELF ADDRESSED THEMSELVES AND PROVIDE MORE PERSPECTIVE ON THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SARAH STEIN HEIMER AND I'M IN A HOUSING ATTORNEY AT LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN TWENTY THREE. CALIFORNIA COUNTIES INCLUDING HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION AND MOST OF THE COUNTIES NORTH OF HERE UP TO THE OREGON BORDER. WHILE WE REPRESENT AND LOWER INCOME PEOPLE ON A BROAD RANGE OF CIVIL LEGAL ISSUES ACCESS TO STABLE HOUSING AND EVICTIONS ARE THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT PEOPLE CONTACT US ABOUT IN EVERY COMMUNITY THAT WE WORK IN. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN BECAUSE IT'LL CLOSE LOOPHOLES IN THE TENANT PROTECTION ACT THAT HAVE RESULTED IN OUR CLIENTS LOSING THEIR HOMES DESPITE THESE NEW AND IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS IN THE STATE. ONE SUCH A LOOPHOLE IS WHEN A LANDLORD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION STATING A FAMILY MEMBER INTENDS TO MOVE IN. RIGHT NOW THE ACT DOES NOT REQUIRE LANDLORDS TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHO WILL MOVE IN AND HOW LONG THE FAMILY MEMBER WILL LIVE IN. THE RENTAL HOME. THE ACT ALSO DOES NOT REQUIRE THE FAMILY MEMBER TO LIVE IN THE RENTAL HOME FOR ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. THIS LEADS TENANTS IN THE IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION OF TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THEY ALLEGE REASON IS REAL OR A PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER REASON. TENANTS HAVE NO WAY TO CHALLENGE THE REASON THE LANDLORD ALLEGES WITHOUT RISKING AN INFECTION. A JUDGMENT AND A MONEY JUDGMENT WHICH HAS SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FOR TENANTS AND MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IF NOT POSSIBLE TO RENT NEW HOUSING. WE HAVE SEEN CASES WHERE THE TERMINATION WAS BASED ON THE ALLEGATION THAT THE OWNER WAS GOING TO MOVE IN BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES STRONGLY SUGGESTED THE OWNER NEVER DID SO. IN ONE CASE OUR CLIENT LIVED IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH ABOUT THIRTY APARTMENTS. THE FAMILY MEMBER WHO ALLEGEDLY PLANNED TO MOVE INTO THAT ONE APARTMENT OUT OF THAT LARGER COMPLEX LIVED OUT OF STATE. OWNED A HOME IN THAT OTHER STATE AND WAS A LICENSED REAL ESTATE AGENT IN THAT STATE. THE FAMILY MEMBER HAD ACTIVE REAL ESTATE LISTINGS SUGGESTING THEY CONTINUED TO WORK IN THAT STATE. OUR CLIENT MOVED OUT OF THE HOME. AND AFTER HE DID SO THE FAMILY MEMBER CONTINUE TO HAVE ACTIVE REAL ESTATE LISTINGS OUT OF STATE. SUGGESTING THINGS REMAINS IN THAT OTHER STATE. IN ANOTHER CASE OUR CLIENT LIVED IN A SMALL MULTI COMP MULTI FAMILY COMPLEX HE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF OWNER ME THEN. AND REPORTED THAT HIS NEIGHBOR RECEIVED THE SAME NOTICE HIS NEIGHBOR MOVED OUT IN RESPONSE TO THAT NOTICE AND THEN SAW THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY. HOLDEN OPEN HOUSE TO RE RENT THE NEIGHBOR'S APARTMENT THE NEXT WEEK. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN LANDLORDS. EMPTY ENTIRE APARTMENT COMPLEXES AND RAISE RENTS AFTER SERVING LONG. TIME TENANTS SUBSTANTIAL REHABILITATION NOTICES. THESE NOTICES MOST OFTEN PROVIDE NO INFORMATION OTHER THAN TO SAY THE LANDLORD INTENDS TO DEMOLISH OR SUBSTANTIALLY REMODELED THE HOME. IN A RECENT CASE OUR CLIENT WHO IS A SENIOR AND BIT BEDRIDDEN DUE TO PHYSICAL DISABILITIES FACE THE LOSS OF HER HOME SHE HAD RENTED FOR SIX YEARS. THE OWNER GAVE ALL OF THE TENANTS AT THE COMPLEX THIS NOTICE SAYING THE OWNER WILL BE REMODELING. THERE WERE NO CURRENT PERMITS ON FILE WITH THE CITY ALL REPAIRS THAT WE OBSERVED AT THE COMPLEX WERE COSMETIC. SUCH AS PAINTING OR MINOR REPAIRS THAT DID NOT REQUIRE TENANTS TO MOVE OUT. OUR CLIENT DID NOT MOVE OUT BECAUSE SHE PHYSICALLY COULD NOT ALL OTHER TENANTS AT THE APARTMENT COMPLEX DID MOVE OUT IN RESPONSE TO THAT NOTICE. OUR CLIENT SETTLED OF. WE REPRESENTED OUR CLIENT IN THE ADDICTION LAWSUIT AND DISCOVERY SHOWED. THAT ALL OF THE REPAIRS PLANNED AND DONE DID NOT RISE TO LEVEL OF SUBSTANTIAL REMODELING. THE OTHER UNITS AT THAT COMPLEX ARE NOW RENTING 440270% MORE A FRIEND THAN THEY WERE AT THE TIME OF THE NOTICE. WE STRONGLY ASK YOU TO SEE A SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN THE SECOND WITNESS IN FAVOR OF YOU CAN KIND OF KEEP IT SHORT YES SIR BURN THROUGH A LOT OF THE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BRYAN ACOSTA ON BEHALF OF. THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION ONE OF THE SPONSORS AND- I'M AMONG OTHERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY WAS AT THE TABLE DURING THESE NEGOTIATIONS. I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE FINAL POINT TO SIR PAUL THE STRINGS TOGETHER ASTHMA STEINER. IS DESCRIBING WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A BRIEF PROBLEM WE ARE NOT CHANGING THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WERE PRESERVING THAT IF THE OWNERS TRULY MOVING IN. THEY CAN AFFECT IF THE OWNER TRULY NEEDS TO- ASK TESTAMENT OFFER SUBSTANTIAL YOU HAVE THAT REMAINS A COST IF THEY'RE EXITING THE RENTAL MARKET. THAT REMAINS BECAUSE WHAT THEY CAN'T DO IS PROFESSOR KATE THEY CANNOT PROVIDE A FAKE REASON. TO EVICT THE TENANT ESCAPE THE PROTECTIONS OF THE LAW AND RAISE THE RENT AND DISPLACED TENANTS AND- WE BELIEVE THE PROVISIONS AND THEIR- SIMPLY SAY. A TO US THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE AND IF IT'S TRUE. THEN EVERYONE MOVES ON BUT IF IT'S NOT TRUE. EITHER THE TENANT SHOULD NOT LOSE THEIR HOUSING OR THE SHOW THE RIGHT TO COME BACK AND THOSE ARE REALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE LAW AND MAKE IT REAL. AND FOR THOSE REASONS- WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE. EVICTIONS OF THIS NATURE AND WE EXPECT TO SEE MORE- IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD URGE AND I'VE FOUGHT TO CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM THAT WISHES TO REGISTER AND THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. COME TO THE MIKE. PRESERVAR NUMBER HAVE A HOUSING CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT.

YET TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES FOR I CAN DO THAT I CAN TALK FOR LONGER EXCELLENT. I HAD DIFFICULTY WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION- ASKING FOR YOUR NO VOTE TODAY I'M AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN. OBVIOUSLY AS THE AUTHORS INDICATED. SEEMS TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES BUT IT DOES MORE THAN THAT- AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS THE BILL THAT- THAT THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE THAT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD BY OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TENANTS AND LABOR GROUPS. ORGANIZATION DID COME TO THE TABLE AND WE STRUCK SOME BALANCE IN THE BILL THAT WAS HISTORIC FOR A RENTAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION TO TALK ABOUT RENT CAPS AND JUST CAUSE EVICTION WHAT WE DIDN'T DO OR WHAT THE BILL DID DO IS LEFT. A BASS LINE IN PLACE RELATING TO- JUST BECAUSE IT LEFT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO DO WHATEVER ELSE THEY WANTED TO ADD AND THEY ARE DOING THAT TODAY. AS YOU KNOW AS SOON AS- AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO PASSED THE PANDEMIC HIT THIS BILL HAS NOT TAKEN FULL EFFECT- IF WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THESE CHANGES- AT LEAST. BY WAY OF WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- HONESTLY WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF SOME OF THESE VOTE THE CHANGES THAT THEY'RE MAKING THOUGH GO BEYOND FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO YOU CAN'T MOVE YOUR MOTHER IN NEXT DOOR IF YOU ALREADY LIVE THERE YOU CAN'T MOVE YOUR STUDENT INTO A HOUSE. IF THEY WON'T LIVE THERE FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COLLEGE AND THEY WOULD MOVE OUT AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME SO THIS BILL DOES MORE THAN JUST CLOSE WHAT ARE PERCEIVED LOOPHOLES. WE DON'T THINK IT'S IN TIME TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC TENANTS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MOVED OUT ANYWAY WE HAD PROTECTIONS IN PLACE- SO THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT WAYS TO AFFECT THAT- SO WHAT THOSE REASONS WERE ASKING FOR YOUR NO VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO REGISTER OPPOSITION IF YOU DO COME UP TO THE MIKE AND DO SO. I DON'T SEE ANYBODY SCRAMBLING TO THE MIKE SO WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP FOR- EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR IF YOU CAN OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ANYBODY WHO IS IN OPPOSITION. TO AB. TWO SEVEN ONE THREE.

ALL RIGHT WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. ANYBODY MR GABRIEL. YEAH I THINK YOU MISTER RIGHT TURN THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR FOR B. FORD THIS BILL I'VE I'VE SHARED WITH HER THAT I AM STRUGGLING WITH THIS ONE AS WELL- AND I'M STRUGGLING I THINK BOTH FINE. PROCESS IN ON SUBSTANCE HERE- AND YOU KNOW FROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE ON IBM. YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM FROM THE AUTHOR AND FROM THE WITNESSES ABOUT HOW CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. WELL AS I THINK YOU DESCRIBED A MADAM CHAIR IS A LANDMARK DEAL- I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION THE- OPPOSITION WITNESS SAID THAT THEIR HISTORIC COMPROMISES MADE BY THE- BY BY. LANDLORDS I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I WAS FRANKLY SHOCKED WHEN THEY AGREED TO- TO GO NUDE NEUTRON THAT BELL. AND WHAT'S GIVING ME PAUSE HERE IS IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK AND CHANGING THE TERMS OF A CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED DEAL- IN A WAY THAT I'M NOT SHORT. IS WARRANTED AND WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THE TABLE IN GOOD FAITH IN NEGOTIATING GET TO A PLACE I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL. FOR ANY HISTORIC FOR THE STATE AND DID A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND THEN IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK. AND MAYBE IN SOME WAYS PUNISHING THOSE WHO MADE CONCESSIONS TO- TO COME TO THE TABLE NINE I AM ALSO STRUGGLING. ON THE SUBSTANCE HERE. AM I THINK AND MR GUSTER DESCRIBED THIS AS AN ISSUE OF PROOF- AS I LOOK AT THE DETAILS IT GOES FAR BEYOND THAT. RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE LOKING HERE WE'RE SAYING. I'M IN OWNER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MOVE IN WITH NINETY DAYS AND STAY FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS I CAN IMAGINE A SCENARIO OF SOMEONE IN MY DISTRICT. WHO OWNS A DUPLEX WITH THAT THEY LIVE IN SOMEONE ELSE LIVES UPSTAIRS THEY HAVE A- CHILD COMING BACK HOME ONCE TO GET IT TO YOUR MASTER'S DEGREE CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE. THEY COULD EVEN MOVE THEIR CHILD BACK INTO THEIR UNIT. OR OR THAT HAVE TO NOT RENT A PLACE FOR YOUR KEEP THEM THERE EVEN IF THEIR CHILD WHEN GOT AT. A JOB IN ANOTHER PLACE SO THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO ME LIKE AN ISSUE OF PROOF THIS SEEMS TO BE CHANGING. SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE DEAL AND SO FOUR WERE REALLY TRYING TO GET OUT HERE AS A PROOF QUESTION AT FIRST I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A REMEDY HEARING WE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM. MR STEIN ABOUT HELD. BY LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUCCESSFULLY LEAD LITIGATING THESE CASES IF WHAT WE NEED IS MORE MONEY FOR LEGAL AID. I'M A THOUSAND PERCENT- IN SUPPORT OF THAT. BUT LET'S CHANGE THE STANDARD OF PROOF BUT TO GO BACK AND SAY YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE IN THE APARTMENT FOR THREE YEARS. YOU'VE GOT A MAIN GET PERMITS OF YOU CAN DO ANY. WE NEED SEEMS TO ME SEEMS THAT WE'RE GETTING AT. WE'RE GETTING AT THE FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE THAT DEAL. IN A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY- AND THEN THE OTHER THING I'D ASK FOR JUST- IN LOOKING IN THE- THE ANALYSIS HERE THERE WAS. IT SAID THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE DOING THIS. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT GIVEN WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE SHOULD BE MOVED OUT ANYWAY SO I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE'S ANY DATA OR RESEARCH. OR ANY METRICS OR STATISTICS THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE ABOUT HOW FREQUENTLY THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING. IF WE HAD A RENTAL REGISTRY WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION- SO I'LL LET SOMEONE ELSE ADDRESS THAT THE DATA AROUND WHO'S WHO'S SORT OF DEALING DAY IN AND DAY OUT WITH FOLKS ARE HAVING THIS EXPERIENCE- I WILL SAY YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAME TO TERMS WITH THE DEAL WE SAID. A NO FAULT EVICTION WOULD BE. YOU KNOW AN OWNER WANTS TO MOVE IN RIGHT AND SO IF AN OWNER WANTS TO MOVE IN IS ONE DAY FARE AND THEN THEY CAN PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET. I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT IS TO ME THAT'S A DEAL POINT THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN NEGOTIATED I I'D HAVE TO EXPECTED. CA WANT TO AGREE TO THAT IF YOU SAID THEY HAVE TO LIVE FORTHREE YEARS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TELLING US RIGHT NOW SO IT DOESN'T TO ME THAT FEELS LIKE AN IMPORTANT DEAL POINT. THAT WE'RE GOING BACK AND REWRITING AFTER THE FACT WHAT I THINK I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE WHAT MOVING MEANT RIGHT AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM IS ONCE WE'VE- THE BILL. ONCE THE LAW HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS. IT IS ESSENTIALLY BEEN USED AS A LOOPHOLE TO EVICT PEOPLE AND THEN TO BUMP UP THE RENT AND BRING INTENDED SAID AND SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE IT'S A LITTLE BIT. IN MY OPINION ADDING MORE DEFINITION TO A PRE EXISTING DEAL SO MAYBE THREE YEARS ISN'T FAIR. WE SHOULD GO SHAPE THAT WE SHOULD. WE SHOULD SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE THINK COULD WORK AND I WELCOME THOSE CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE DAY AND THREE YEARS MAYBE IS WHERE WE WOULD LAND ON THAT AND I THINK THAT'S MY HOPE IS THAT THE CONVERSATION CAN KEEP GOING. AND WE CAN SAY WHAT DOES SEEM FAIR FROM YOUR GUISES PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AROUND. YOU KNOW ENSURING THAT- IF AN OWNER IS TRULY MOVING IN THEN THEY'RE REALLY MOVING IN. AYE AYE AYE CHAU I SUPER APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. IT EEMS TO ME LIKE THE DEAL POINT WISE WILL LEAVE THIS QUESTION UP TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SO IT SEEMS LIKE THAT PART OF IT WAS NEGOTIATED. AND I GUESS I WOULD SAY SECONDLY FROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE. GIVEN THE WAY THAT FOLKS STRETCH TO CREATE CRAFTER THIS IS START DEAL. I WOULD I WOULD THINK THAT. THE RESPONSE WOULD BE TO GO TO THEM FIRST AND SAY HEY. WE THINK THERE'S A HANDFUL OF UNSCRUPULOUS FOLKS OUT THERE AND I WAS MOVED BY MISTIMES TESTIMONY I THINK IT SOUNDED LIKE. REAL SCUMBAGS OUT THERE. CAN WE WORK WITH YOU ON A- ON A FIX TO ADDRESS PEOPLE WHO ARE CIRCUMVENTING AS- AND- IT AND I WISH THAT THAT HAD HAPPENED FIRST RATHER THAN. JUST COMING HERE AND SAYING. WE'RE GONNA ROUTE GO BACK. CHANGE THE TERMS HERE AND ADD THIS THREE YEAR THING WHICH- TO ME THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT. YEAH AND I AND I ALSO AND LET. MISTER JUSTICE BECAUSE WELL- AND I THINK THAT'S- PART OF THIS PROCESS RIGHT AND- AND- RESPECTFULLY THE OPPOSITION LETTER DIDN'T REALLY ALLOWED ANY OTHER. COUNTERPOINT RIGHT IT WAS. JUST SORT OF A BLANKET OPPOSITION. MY HOPE IS WE CAN CONTINUE THE NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THAT'S- THE- THAT'S WHAT THIS. PRODUCT POLICY PROCESS IS FOR. WE HAVE ALREADY OPENED UP FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. WE DIDN'T TWENTY TWENTY. WE RENEGOTIATED SOME OF THOSE TERMS ALREADY. SO I DON'T THINK THE LANGUAGES IN SICILY SACROSANCT. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. FINE TUNE AND AS WE IMPLEMENT LAW WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING KIND OF. WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT IS NOT WORKING. AND I AND LIKE I SAID I WELCOME THE CONVERSATION AND I HOPE THAT THAT'S A PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET IF WE CAN. GET THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S IMPORTANT. AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE. THE PURPOSE OF STATION BUILDERS. REALLY CAME TO THE TABLE AND THAT PROCESS AND I WANT TO RESPECT. THEIR WORK IN THAT IN PERSPECTIVE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE. AND THE FACT THAT I THINK THEY ALSO HAD TO MOVE THEIR CONSTITUENCIES CONSIDERABLY. FOR THAT AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M I THINK I'VE NOTICED SOMEONE WHO WELCOMES THOSE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS SO IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE CAN KEEP DOING AYE AYE I APPRECIATE THEM AND IN TURN I THINK PART OF WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IT REACT TO IS THE CHARACTERIZATION THAT THIS IS A PROOF ISSUE. THREE YEARS DOES NOT STRIKE ME AS A PROFESSION. THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL DEAL POINT. AND TO HAVE IT REPRESENTED THAT WAY. IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING. NO I HEAR THAT AND I THINK- I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF I'M- VERY WILLING TO NEGOTIATE ON THAT. THEN IF I MAY JUST WRITTEN RESPONSE. I'M WELL I WAS TRYING TO CUT MY REMARKS ON MR GABRIEL BUT I DO. I DO THINK IT IS A PROBLEM A PROOF AND RIGHT NOW WHERE WE ARE. IS AS MISS NINE ARMORED TESTIFIED. IN A SITUATION WHERE LANDLORDS CAN SAY ARE MOVING AND- AND NEVER MOVE AND IT'S A HEAD FAKE.% SO HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE MEASURE. THAT THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH THAT THEY ARE. IN GOOD FAITH INTENDING TO MOVE IN. WELL CERTAINLY NUMBER ONE. THEY SHOULD MOVE IT. NUMBER TWO. THEY SHOULD REMAIN IN OCCUPANCY FOR SOME AMOUNT OF TIME SO I THINK. THAT IS THREE YEARS THE RIGHT. METRIC RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ZERO. SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ZERO AND THREE YEARS. WOULD SUBSTANTIATE THAT THEIR GOOD FAITH REASON WAS IN FACT A RECENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR. AND I THINK IF THAT'S THE POINT WE HAVE A VERY WELL DEVELOPED BODY OF LAW ON THE STATE FOR HOW WE DO PREFER RIGHT WE HAVE SHIFTING BURDENS WE HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS OF PROOF WE HAVE EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS. THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE COULD DO. DIFFERENT THAN SAYING. YOU HAVE TO LIVE THERE FOR THREE YEARS. SO IF IT'S REALLY A PROBLEM OF PROOF. LET'S GO LOOK AT THAT AND COME UP AND I THINK WE COULD NOT GET OUT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO PROVE. THAT YOU REALLY WERE MOVING IN. AND THIS IS IN A PRE TAX BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH THAT AND A WHOLE BROAD. ARRAY OF CONTEXT. BUT TO SAY YOU HAVE TO LIVE THERE FOR THREE YEARS. THAT IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL AND NOT AND NOT REALLY FRUSTRATES ME. ACTION ON THAT BUT- HOW. HOW POST TALK TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. HER GOOD FAITH INTENTION WAS REAL AND THAT'S THAT'S ALREADY COMING OUT OF THAT THERE WAS RELEASED ON. BUT WE DO THAT IN THE APPOINTED CONTEXT ALL THE TIME. I'M RIGHT I MEAN WHEN IT IS THIS A PRETEXT OR SOMEONE FIRED FOR DIFFERENT REASON I MEAN WE HAVE. THIS IS NOT. A UNIQUE PROBLEM TO THIS AREA OF LAW. THIS IS WHY WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH OPPONENTS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION. ANYBODY ELSE MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE AGAIN FOR THE DISCUSSION ON THE BILL I WILL HAVE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS AND SENTIMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE UP IN THE VALLEY HAS ALSO EXPRESSED IN YOU AND I HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS IS ALL I'M REALLY CURIOUS AS TO THE IMPACT TO SMALL MOM AND POPS I KNOW FIRST CONVERSATION ABOUT DUPLEXES I'D LIKE TO KNOW THE IMPACT TO. A HOMEOWNER THAT HAS A FOUR PLEX- AND REALLY JUST THE IMPACT TO EVERYDAY PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY THE MUCH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF HOUSING. HAS A HOME A DUPLEX AND EIGHTY YOU FOR SMALL UNITS ON THE PROPERTY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HUGE APARTMENT COMPLEXES WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SMALL RESIDENTIAL. THE UNIT THAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON TO- R. ONE ZONING ARE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR. AND I'M I AM CONCERNED. THAT WE MIX THESE SITUATIONS ARE THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HUGE HOUSING COMPLEXES WITH SMALLER UNITS- AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW FAMILIES IN MY COMMUNITY WOULD BE IMPACTED TO US WELL AND AS YOU CONTINUE TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD- THOSE ARE SOMETHING THAT I HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT. I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY TO ENSURE THAT THE CONVERSATION FROM FORWARD. BUT IF WE DON'T GET TO A GOOD PLACE BY THE TIME THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS REACHES THE FLOOR. THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION YEAH NO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND AGAIN I THINK THE- THE GOAL HERE IS YOU KNOW. WE MADE A DEAL THAT SAYS OWNERS CAN MOVE IN. WE JUST WANTED SURE THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT WE MADE A DEAL THAT SAYS YOU KNOW- IF THE PLACE NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW REHAB. THAT TENANTS CAN BE EVICTED IN AT NO FAULT AND THE PROPERTY OWNER HAS THE RIGHT TO DO THAT. WHICH IS ENSURING THAT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS RIGHT- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THINGS OR TRY TO TACKLE HERE LIKE I SAID I WELCOME THE NEGOTIATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO IT AND MY HOPE IS WE CAN GET THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO DO THAT. RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN KEEP HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE PURPOSES STATION THE REALTORS AND OTHERS- HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THIS BECAUSE I ALSO UNDERSTAND WITH THE LANDLORDS HAVE GONE THROUGH OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS RIGHT. AND A LOT OF THEM ARE MOM AND POPS AS YOU SAID WHO THIS IS THIS IS THEIR FOUR OH ONE K. OR THEIR PENSION FUND RIGHT THIS IS NOT. YOU KNOW- THEY'RE NOT SITTING ON A HUNDRED UNITS OR TWO HUNDRED UNITS THEY OWN A DUPLEX. YOU KNOW THEY'VE SPENT THEIR LIFE BUILDING UP EQUITY THERE THIS IS WHAT THIRD THIRD DRAWING ON FOR THEIR RETIREMENT SO I THINK WE WANT TO BE FAIR. THIS IS ONE ENSURE THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THE TRUE I THINK INTENT IS HONORED AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO TRY TO PROVIDE DEFINITION AROUND. HI ANYBODY ELSE. AND THEN MR GABRIEL YOU CAN FOLLOW. GO AHEAD AT THE RISK OF MAKING MY COLLEAGUES EVEN HUNGRIER SO I JUST WANT TO. SAY YOU KNOW- MADAM TRY I DEEPLY APPRECIATE YOU AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE TERM ARE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND OUT OF DIFFERENCE TO YOU AND RESPECT FOR YOU IN THIS NEW CHAIRMANSHIP I'M GONNA VOTE TODAY TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TO ALLOW US TO HAVE A CHANCE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION- I'VE SEEN YOU BE A SKILLFUL DEAL.MAKER NEGOTIATOR AND I'M I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY TO BRING FOLKS TO THE TABLE- BUT I DO WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU OFFLINE ABOUT SORT OF YOU KNOW HOW THIS BILL WORKS WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET OUT WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS IS BECAUSE BEFORE WE GO BACK AND- BLOW UP. WHEN EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM THINKS AS A LANDMARK DEAL- I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE REALLY THINK THAT THREAT SO LET'S I WILL VOTE TO MOVE THE BILL FOR TODAY BUT LOOK PART OF THOSE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU I APPRECIATE THAT MR GABRIEL. MISS QUIRK-SILVA- AGAIN THANK YOU TO FOR. TO THE AUTHOR BUT ALSO TO THE OPPOSITION AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF THESE BILLS THAT. I THINK IS DIFFICULT FOR THE MEMBERS HERE IT ISN'T THAT WEEK WE WANT TO. ENSURE THAT THERE AREN'T- PROPERTY OWNERS THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY AT THIS VERY VULNERABLE TIME. WE ALSO KNOW THAT TOO MANY OF THE PROTECTIONS. FOR RENTERS. HAVE NOT- THERE ARE MANY MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN LINE TO GET SOME OF THAT RENTAL PROTECTION WHICH IS GOING TO COMPOUND. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOW THAT BEING SAID- TOO OFTEN WE FIX ONE THING. AND THEN. LIKE I SAID IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS. MANY TIMES. ADD ANOTHER. BURDEN SO. I WILL ECHO MY- REMARKS TO. MY COLLEAGUE. TO THE LEFT HERE WHICH IS. AGAIN YOU KNOW WE LEARN THINGS AT THESE HEARINGS. SO EVEN IF WE- FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE BILL WE HEAR DIFFERENT- TESTIMONY AND THAT COULD VERY WELL CHANGE HOW WE INITIALLY FILL SO AGAIN I WILL SUPPORT IT COMING OUT BUT I REALLY HOPE THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF WORK THAT CAN BE DONE. SO THAT IN FACT THIS CAN GET THROUGH THE FLOOR AND GET THE SUPPORT YOU WANT. THANK YOU AND WE ALSO SPENT A PERIOD OF SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS.
