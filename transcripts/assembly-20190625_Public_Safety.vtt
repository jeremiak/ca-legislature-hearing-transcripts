THE DEFENSE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS

00:33:12.357 --> 00:33:14.258
IT'S INCONVENIENT FOR DEFENSE

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:16.494

JURISDICTION?

00:33:31.075 --> 00:33:34.078
JURISDICTIONS NOT ONLY IS THAT

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:36.114
CONSOLIDATION PROBLEMATIC FOR

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.049
THE DEFENSE BUT IT GIVES THE

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:40.718
PROSECUTION AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.286
THEY WILL GET CONVICTIONS IN

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:43.755
CASES WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:46.190
WASN'T GUILTY BECAUSE WE CASES

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:48.025

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:49.527
WEIGHT OF AGGREGATING THE

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.004
CONVICT.

00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:01.873

PROTECTED FROM THOSE THOSE

00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.928
ACTIONS SO I FEEL THAT IT'S VERY

00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:32.930
IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT WE MOVE

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:35.433
FORWARD WITH THAT OF IT AND WHEN

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.767
YOU LOOK AT THIS THIS IS NOT.

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:38.903
IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.171

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:43.941
NUMBER OF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE.

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:45.776
OF THE LOCATION AND COMPLEXITY

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:47.044
THE LIKELY EVIDENCE WHERE THE

00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:48.613

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:49.714

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.383
IT'S UP TO THE JUDGE TO MAKE THE

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.318
DECISION AND TO ALLOW THIS OR

00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:56.287
NOT ALLOWED THIS BASED ON THE

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:57.588

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.758

IN HERE THIS MORNING AND WE DO

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:18.943

WE'RE THE TO GO TO YOUR

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:22.613
DISCRETION STRUCTURE.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.849

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:26.717

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:38.696
REALLY DO NEED TO MOVE FORWARD

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.331
AND DO SOMETHING I BELIEVE THAT

00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:41.065
THE COURT AND IN THEIR

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:42.433

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:44.602

CITIZEN.

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:17.247
EAGER TO BUILD A PRODUCTIVE LIFE.

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:18.916
I WAS GIVEN FOUR MONTHS INSIDE A

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:20.717
TRANSITIONAL HOME IS SEEM LIKE

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:22.119
THE MOMENT I STEPPED THROUGH

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:23.187
THOSE DOORS.

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:24.655
I WAS GREETED WITH A HARSH

00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.023
REALITY.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.558
USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT

00:45:27.624 --> 00:45:29.359
THAT YOU JUST CAME HOME ONE OF

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:31.295
THE FIRST QUESTION IS -- HOW DO

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:38.435
ANXIETY WORRY AND FEAR.

00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:39.703
I QUICKLY LEARNED UPON MY

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:40.971
RELEASE THAT THE AVERAGE RENT

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:42.639
WAS AT LEAST A THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:43.674
OR MORE.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.975
I KNEW THAT FINDING ADEQUATE

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.977
HOUSING WAS A VITAL COMPONENT IN

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:48.612
THE SUCCESS OF MY FUTURE.

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:50.848
BUT I WAS GIVEN JUST FOUR MONTHS

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:51.982

LOSING CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF.

00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:01.758
LIVING IN A COLD WET HOME THE

00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:03.694
MAIN TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WAS

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.395
HOUSING I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT I

00:46:05.462 --> 00:46:06.697
WAS FAR FROM ALONE FOR MY

00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:08.265
ANXIETY AND WORRIES.

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:09.933
OUR CASE MANAGERS HAVE LITTLE TO

OF TIME BEFORE FINDING HOUSING

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:30.654
SO SHE HAD TO LIVE IN A CAR FOR

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:32.456
A WHILE.

00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:34.057

PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED FOR THE

I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION OF THE

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:50.420

OUR EMPLOYEES.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:08.038
AND IN MY OPINION THIS BILL IS

00:50:08.105 --> 00:50:11.875
PREMISED ON INACCURATE DATA.

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:13.410
WHEN THE BILL WHEN I READ THE

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:14.911
BILL THEY WERE REFERRING TO A

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.880
UCLA STUDY?

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:19.516
THAT WAS FROM THE YEAR TWO

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:20.751
THOUSAND SIXTEEN WORD THE IS ME

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:22.753
DOLLARS WORSE AND WORSE SPEND

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:25.188
ABOUT -- THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PER

MONTH FOR HOUSING PURPOSES.

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:30.761
AS OF OF MAY OF TWENTY NINETEEN

00:50:30.827 --> 00:50:31.962

IS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:41.905
AND I BELIEVE THAT IF ANYTHING

00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:44.107
WE NEED MORE RESOURCES FOR

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:45.776
HOUSING PURPOSE IS NOT TO

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:47.110
REDUCING OR GIVING IT TO A

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:48.178
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT WHICH I

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:49.212

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:57.954
SO.

00:50:58.021 --> 00:50:59.823
THE BILL WAS BASED ON THE

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.058

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:07.030
ON THE UCLA STUDY.

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:09.232
NOW WE'RE SPENDING FIFTY TWO

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:09.833
THOUSAND THIS IS NOT REFLECTED

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.036
IN THE BILL AND I BELIEVE THIS

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:14.304
IS THE AT OWN USE FOUNDATION.

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:16.740

AND WE OPPOSE THIS -- BILL FOR

00:51:31.888 --> 00:51:33.690
THREE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS THE

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:36.092
FIRST REASON THAT WE OPPOSE THIS

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:38.328
BILL IS BECAUSE THAT IS THE

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:40.797
SMITH PROGRAM IS FOR THOSE WHO

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:44.034

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:03.553
DISABLED.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:08.625
SECONDLY -- AND CANDIDLY -- THIS

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:11.495
IS ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS THAT

00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:14.130
AFRICAN AMERICANS -- AND

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:16.333
MINORITIES ARE PLAYING A

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:19.336
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN RUNNING.

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:22.372
OPERATING AND HAM DILLON.

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:25.342

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:31.248
PARTICULAR POPULATION BUT THAT

00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:32.616
THE EMPLOYMENT PIECE.

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:36.720
IS IS RIGHT AND FINALLY -- MY

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:39.089
COLLEAGUE THE PSYCHOLOGIST HERE

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:40.590

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:42.559
WHAT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS I

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:44.594
BELIEVE THIS IS A RECIPE FOR

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.397
FAILURE I BELIEVE THE INTENT?

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:49.833
IS GOOD BUT I THINK IT'S A

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.636
RECIPE FOR FAILURE BECAUSE THIS

00:52:52.702 --> 00:52:55.739
PARTICULAR POPULATION -- THE

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:58.174
DUALLY DIAGNOSED SEVERELY

INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT IN PLACE

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:09.486
TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AND

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:13.523
MANY OF THESE PEOPLE -- NEED THE

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:16.192
WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT THE

00:53:16.259 --> 00:53:18.828
OTHER HOUSING PROVIDERS MAY NOT

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:21.064
BE IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE.

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:23.500

AND I WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO DO

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:31.508
WHAT YOU DID THE PREVIOUS THREE

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:35.845
TIMES AND THAT IS OPPOSE THIS

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:37.881
BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:38.748
ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:41.351
OPPOSITION.

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:42.452
COMPARING QUESTIONS FROM

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:45.188
COMMITMENTS THERE QUIRK YES --

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:46.890
WITH REGARD TO THE OPPOSITION.

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:47.991
YOU REALLY SHOULD PUT IN THE

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:50.660
LETTER BECAUSE COMING UP AT THE

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:52.095
LAST MINUTE LIKE THIS.

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:53.997
WE DON'T HAVE A WAY OF CHECKING

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:54.898
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:57.267
THE OTHER THING IS THERE WAS A

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:58.368
TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDY FROM UCLA

00:53:58.435 --> 00:54:00.003
YOU SAID THE LAST STUDY WAS MANY

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:00.870
YEARS AGO.

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:03.239
WHICH SHOWED THAT THIS DOES NOT

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:05.575
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM.

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:07.210
AND IN ADDITION ONCE YOU'VE GOT

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:08.745
HOUSING IF THE PERSON IS

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:10.547
MENTALLY ILL THEY GET THEIR

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.449
SUBJECT TO MEDI CAL.

00:54:12.515 --> 00:54:14.951
AND THE REASON I FIRMLY BELIEVE

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:16.920
THAT THIS IS A GOOD.

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:19.255

00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:31.735
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:32.302
YES MISTER LACKEY.

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:35.038
A FIRST OF ALL I'D I FIND THE I

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:35.572
HOPE WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:36.573
ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.141
BECAUSE OUR NEW TO ME.

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:39.576
AND THEY SEEM TO BE QUITE THE

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:41.411
GENTLEMAN AS YOU KNOW ALL THE

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:42.779
THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED --

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:45.649
SERVICE NETWORK IS CLEARLY IN

00:54:45.715 --> 00:54:46.483
JEOPARDY.

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:49.552
WITHOUT THE INCARCERATED PIECE --

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.354
THIS BODY IS NOT DOING A GOOD

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:53.223
JOB OF FUNDING.

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:55.458
THAT SERVICE ASPECT AND THIS

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:57.961
JUST ADDS TO THE DISTRESS TO

00:54:58.028 --> 00:54:59.162
THAT THAT WHOLE.

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:01.231
A SERVICE MODEL THAT. ONE OF THE

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:05.468
OTHER QUESTIONS I HAD IS -- THE

00:55:05.535 --> 00:55:06.469
DURATION OF ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:07.170
IT SEEMS TO BE SOME.

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:10.240
SOME NEXT -- INDICATORS IN THE

00:55:10.306 --> 00:55:11.474
ACTUAL BILL.

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:13.610
AND IN ONE PORTION OF THE BILL

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:15.111
IT INDICATES THAT -- THEY'RE

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:17.447
ELIGIBLE SO LONG AS MEDICALLY

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:18.748
NECESSARY.

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:21.618
THEN JUST FURTHER IN THE BILL.

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:23.420
AS SAYS THE ELIGIBILITY LAST AS

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.221
LONG AS A PARTICIPANT NEEDS THE

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:26.456
ASSISTANCE.

00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:28.024
AND THEN IN THE THIRD.

00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:29.526
JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:30.860
AT SAYS THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE SO

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.495
LONG AS A PARTICIPANT NEEDS THE

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:35.031
SERVICES OR THE GRANT PERIOD

00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:35.699
DOWNS.

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:37.400
SO IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT

00:55:37.467 --> 00:55:38.334
CONFUSING TO ME.

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:39.536
AND IF YOU COULD TRY TO BRING

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:42.005
SOME CLARITY TO THAT PIECE I

00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:44.140
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT ALSO.

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:44.741
THE RAINY OTHER.

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:45.709
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:48.311
OKAY GOOD.

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:50.880
THE ONE OKAY -- ESSENTIALLY

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:53.216
HERE'S THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:54.818
CORRECTIONS IN CARS RICH PEOPLE

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:57.554
IN THE STATE FACILITIES.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.656
ONCE THEY LEAVE THE STATE FOR SO

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:00.957
THERE IN THE COMMUNITY AND

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.425
THEY'RE ON A ROLL IN THE PAROLE

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:03.660
SYSTEM.

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:08.531
AND IF THEY HAPPEN TO NEED.

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:12.368
MENTAL HEALTH -- PROGRAMS --

00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:13.937
THEY SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND ARE

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:17.540
ELIGIBLE -- UNLESS THEY HAVE A

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:19.075
LOT OF MONEY IN INCOME.

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:20.577
WHICH IN THAT CASE THEY WOULD

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:22.512
HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE THEY

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:23.880
WOULD BE IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM.

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:26.049
THE MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:27.817
SYSTEMS RUN BY THE COUNTY.

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:31.387
AND I WILL QUOTE A LETTER FROM

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:32.989
THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES FOR

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:35.125
YOU -- THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:36.159
MENTAL HEALTH NOTICES THE

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.594
COUNTY'S INVOLVEMENT IN THIS

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.129
NEWLY CREATED PROGRAM WOULD

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:41.965
FACILITATE CONNECTING PAROLEES.

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:43.366
THAT NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:45.535
TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY NETWORK OF

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:46.903
RESOURCES AND SUPPORT OF

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.104
PROGRAMS.

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:50.707
SO THE IDEA OF THIS PROGRAM IS

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.075
TO GET HIM INTO THOSE COUNTY

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:53.777
SYSTEMS.

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:55.111
PROVIDE THAT HOUSING.

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.279
AND THEN CONNECT THEM WITH THE

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:59.649
EXISTING COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH

00:56:59.716 --> 00:57:02.118
SYSTEMS WITCHER THE SYSTEMS THAT

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:03.286
PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH IN THE

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:03.720
COMMUNITY.

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:05.755
SO THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:06.823
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:08.525
ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:09.692
THE EXISTING.

00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:12.395
PROGRAM WHICH IS A SEGREGATED

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:13.830
OUTSIDE THE COUNTY.

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:15.565
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT WE THE

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:18.301
STATE ARE PAYING FOR A 100% OF

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:19.636
THE MENTAL HEALTH.

00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:24.541
COST SO SEND MY OPINION THE BILL

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:25.809
IS AN IMPROVEMENT.

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:27.510
IN A IN A AN IMPROVEMENT AND AND

00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:28.578
AND AND ESTABLISHES A

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:31.314
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE COUNTIES.

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:33.950
IN THE STATE.

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:35.652
FOR A PROPERLY HANDLING.

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:37.153
OF PAROLEES LEAVING THE

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.421
INCARCERATED SYSTEM IN

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:40.523
CALIFORNIA SO.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.159
THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF HOW.

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:44.661
THE COUNTIES TO MILL HEALTH.

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.229
YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:47.730
HEALTH.

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.732
SO WE WANT TO LINK THESE PEOPLE

00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:51.467
UP WITH THE COUNTY SYSTEM AND

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:52.702
THAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT THING

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.404
WE CAN DO AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.538
PROGRAM DOES.

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:58.374

SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL TO BE

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.616
ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEW PROGRAM AS

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:10.053

00:58:20.763 --> 00:58:23.566
IN WHICH THAT TIME THEY TRY THEY

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:24.968
BASICALLY DROP OUT OF THE

00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:26.436

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:29.439
EVEN IF THEY DO CONTINUE TO

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.174
RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.542
THROUGH THE TERM OF THEIR PAROLE

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:33.443
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A BREAK

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.815
SEEK MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:39.849
FROM THE COUNTY.

EXPERIENCING.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.156
AND THE TRAUMAS THAT MY FAMILY

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:42.724
HAD EXPERIENCE THAT IT LED TO

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.125
THOSE TWO DEATHS.

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:45.393
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.295
DECISION TO START RECEIVING THE

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:48.730
SUPPORT THAT I NEEDED FOR MYSELF

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:49.597
AND MY CHILDREN.

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:50.899
I WISH THAT I COULD SAY THAT THE

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:52.300
REST OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:53.668
DONE THE SAME.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:54.769
I'M HERE TODAY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.204
WHEN THEY ARE READY THEY HAVE

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:58.973
ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.042
SEEING SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IS

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:02.544
ABOUT MORE THAN A TIME TABLE IS

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:04.279
ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:05.246
IT'S ABOUT CENTERING THE NEEDS

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.448
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:08.283
IMPACTED BY CRIME BECAUSE IF

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.684
WE'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE TRAUMA

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:10.952
THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED.

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:12.320
AND ALLOW THEM TO STABILIZE

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:13.855
THEIR LIVES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:14.689
THEY'LL BE SAFE IN THE

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:16.057
COMMUNITIES OF THE SAFE WILL BE

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:17.892
GREATER WHAT DO WE KNOW TO BE A

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:19.828
FACT ONE TO THREE ONE IN THREE

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:21.196
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:22.297
CRIME.

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:23.732
THE BIGGEST PREDICTOR OF BEING A

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:24.999
VICTIM OF CRIME IS THAT YOU'VE

01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:26.568
BEEN A VICTIM BEFORE AS IN THE

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.002
CASE OF MY FAMILY.

01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:30.138
THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.573
A REPEAT VICTIMISATION.

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.308
ARE LEAST LIKELY TO ACCESS ANY

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:34.743
KIND OF HELP.

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:35.944
AND THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.112
CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE THINK

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:39.447
ABOUT WHO NEED SUPPORT AND HOW

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:40.415
THESE RULES WORK FOR THEM.

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:42.417
WE AS A STATE OR IN THE PROCESS

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:44.419
OF BECOMING MORE TRAUMA INFORMED.

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:46.154
WE UNDERSTAND AND KNOW SO MUCH

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:47.288
MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS AND

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:48.556
WE'RE WORKING EVERY DAY TO BE

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:49.924
MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:51.292
OUR COMMUNITY.

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:52.694
THE VAST MAJORITY OF VICTIMS

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:53.962
DAHLE ACCESS VICTIMS

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:56.097
COMPENSATION BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:57.532
CONNECT TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:59.334
AND EVEN REPORTING CRIME.

01:23:59.401 --> 01:23:59.934
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.069
TRAUMA DOESN'T EXIST IN THAT WE

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.604
DON'T NEED TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:03.738
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:06.741
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ADDRESS IT.

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:07.876
WITHOUT REPEATEDLY IN STUDIES

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:09.577
THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:11.112
REPORT TO THEIR FRIENDS OR TO A

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:12.781
HOSPITAL THEN TO THE CRIMINAL

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:13.782

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.417
ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR PEOPLE OF

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:17.986
THAT EXPERIENCE REPEAT

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:19.754
VICTIMISATION SO WE MUST MAKE

01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:22.056
THE WHOLE SYSTEM MORE ACCESSIBLE

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:23.425
AND MORE COUNTABLE.

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:24.559

BILL'S AUTHOR IN LAW ENFORCEMENT --

01:51:02.856 --> 01:51:04.424
THAT THROUGH THIS BILL THEY ARE

EVERY AGENCY REQUIRES DE

01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:11.698
ESCALATION.

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:13.566
REQUIRES OFFICERS TO REPORT AND

01:51:13.633 --> 01:51:15.368
INTERVENE IN EXCESSIVE USE OF

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:17.203

01:51:20.974 --> 01:51:22.375
HOWEVER.

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:24.177
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL EVEN

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:25.678
WITH THE AUTHOR'S LAST MINUTE

01:51:25.745 --> 01:51:27.981
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- WHICH WE

ARE PROVIDED WITH JUST THIS

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:29.616
MORNING.

01:51:29.682 --> 01:51:31.351
RETAIN SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS

01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:33.253
THAT UNDERMINE REFORMS SOUGHT BY

01:51:33.319 --> 01:51:36.423
AB -- THREE NINE TWO AND THESE

01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:39.526
MUST BE ADDRESSED AND WE REMAIN

01:51:39.592 --> 01:51:41.061
OPPOSED AND LESS AMENDED.

01:51:41.127 --> 01:51:42.195
FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:44.297
BILL DEFINES THE WORD FEASIBLE

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:45.665
IN A WAY THAT UNDERMINES THE DE

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:47.033
ESCALATION REQUIREMENTS IN THIS

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:50.203
BILL AND KEY ELEMENTS OF AB

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.737
THREE NINE TWO BY DEFINING

01:51:50.804 --> 01:51:53.006
FEASIBLE. TO MEAN IT AN ACT THAT

01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:54.941
CARRIES NO INCREASE IN RISK TO

01:51:55.008 --> 01:51:56.709
AN OFFICER THAT IS NOT A

01:51:56.776 --> 01:51:58.278
REALISTIC DEFINITION FEASIBLE

01:51:58.344 --> 01:52:00.213
DOES NOT MEAN ZERO RISK IT MEANS

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.548
REASONABLE RISK.

01:52:01.614 --> 01:52:03.016
AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFTEN NOTES

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:04.651
OFFICERS FACE SOME RISK IS PART

01:52:04.717 --> 01:52:06.386
OF THE JOB.

01:52:06.453 --> 01:52:07.654
IN THE CASE OF DEADLY FORCE THE

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.522
SAFEST ROUTE WILL ALWAYS BE FOR

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:11.124
OFFICERS TO SHOOT ANY POTENTIAL

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:13.393
THREAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:14.494
ANY OTHER COURSE OF ACTION

01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:16.429
INCREASES THE RISK TO OFFICERS

01:52:16.496 --> 01:52:18.031
TO SOME DEGREE BUT THAT SHOULD

01:52:18.098 --> 01:52:19.332
NOT BE THE MEASURE WE MUST

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:21.134
REQUIRE OFFICERS TO TAKE TIME TO

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:22.869
DE ESCALATE WE'RE DOING SO DOES

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:24.771
NOT UNREASONABLY.

01:52:24.838 --> 01:52:26.439
INCREASE THE RISK TO OFFICER.

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:27.674
THE DEFINITION OF FEASIBLE AS

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.008
WRITTEN NOT ONLY MAKES THE DE

01:52:29.075 --> 01:52:30.343
ESCALATION REQUIREMENT IN THIS

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:31.978
BILL EXTRAORDINARILY WEAK BUT

01:52:32.045 --> 01:52:34.814
UNDERMINES KEY LANGUAGE IN AB

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:35.482
THREE NINE TWO THAT WAS ADDED TO

01:52:35.548 --> 01:52:36.816

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:38.918
LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISE.

01:52:38.985 --> 01:52:40.954
SECOND THE BILL IN SECTION ONE

01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.255
SUBDIVISION AFTER CLAIRE'S THAT

01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:44.290
NO POLICY CAN ANTICIPATE EVERY

01:52:44.357 --> 01:52:45.959
CONCEIVABLE SITUATION OR

01:52:46.025 --> 01:52:47.494
EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:50.430
OFFICERS MAY FACE.

01:52:50.497 --> 01:52:52.298
THIS SUGGESTS THE DANGEROUS IDEA

01:52:52.365 --> 01:52:53.766
THE POLICIES ARE NOT DESIGNED TO

01:52:53.833 --> 01:52:55.602
APPLY TO ALL SITUATIONS IMPLIES

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:57.070

AN AGENCIES USE OF FORCE POLICY

01:52:58.872 --> 01:53:00.707
IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:53:00.773 --> 01:53:02.041
BUT THE VERY POINT OF USE OF

01:53:02.108 --> 01:53:03.743
FORCE POLICIES AND OF THIS BILL

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:05.145
IS TO REGULATE OFFICERS USE OF

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:07.080
FORCE AT ALL TIMES INCLUDING

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:08.515
EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS WHERE

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:11.217
DEADLY FORCE IS REQUIRED.

01:53:11.284 --> 01:53:11.851
AND THE BILL LANGUAGE SHOULD NOT

01:53:11.918 --> 01:53:12.619
MONEY THAT.

01:53:12.685 --> 01:53:14.554
THIRD IN SECTION ONE G. THE BILL

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:15.622
CONTINUES TO INCLUDE THE

01:53:15.688 --> 01:53:16.756
DECLARATION THAT A LAW

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:18.258
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE OF

01:53:18.324 --> 01:53:19.325
FORCE POLICY IN TRAINING SHOULD

01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:21.427
BE ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE IN ANY

01:53:21.494 --> 01:53:22.829
PROCEEDING INVOLVING A USE.

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:24.264
AN OFFICER'S USE OF FORCE.

01:53:24.330 --> 01:53:25.832
THIS LANGUAGE UNFORTUNATELY

01:53:25.899 --> 01:53:27.567
CREATES A PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:29.169
HAVE POLICIES IN TRAINING ON USE

01:53:29.235 --> 01:53:30.303
OF FORCE THAT ARE AS LACKS AND

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:31.704
PERMISSIVE AS POSSIBLE.

01:53:31.771 --> 01:53:33.072
SO THAT OFFICERS CAN BE SHOWN TO

01:53:33.139 --> 01:53:34.340
BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICY

01:53:34.407 --> 01:53:35.475
IN TRAINING.

01:53:35.542 --> 01:53:36.776
IS INTRODUCED INTO EVIDENCE IN

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:38.211
ORDER TO REDUCE LIABILITY FOR

01:53:38.278 --> 01:53:40.446
OFFICERS AND THE COSTS OF

01:53:40.513 --> 01:53:42.115
AGENCIES THAT INDEMNIFY THEM.

01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:43.349
INDEED THIS CRITICISM WAS LEVIED

01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:45.451
AGAINST LAST YEAR'S AB NINE

01:53:45.518 --> 01:53:46.052
THREE ONE IN AN OPINION PIECE

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:47.787
WRITTEN JOINTLY BY THE LAPD'S

01:53:47.854 --> 01:53:49.889
HEAD OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING

01:53:49.956 --> 01:53:52.225
AND A LEADING EXPERT IN POLICING.

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:53.526
THIS SHOULD BE REMOVED.

01:53:53.593 --> 01:53:55.862
FINALLY IN SECTION TO BE TWO THE

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:56.296
BILL WOULD MANDATE A

01:53:56.362 --> 01:53:57.964
PROPORTIONALITY REQUIREMENT THAT

01:53:58.031 --> 01:53:59.699
MISSTATES THE CONSIDERATIONS FOR

01:53:59.766 --> 01:54:01.034
THAT TEST.

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:01.601
THE BILL MAKES FORCE

01:54:01.668 --> 01:54:03.836
PROPORTIONAL TO THE SERIOUSNESS

01:54:03.903 --> 01:54:05.004
OF A SUSPECTED OFFENSE A

01:54:05.071 --> 01:54:05.939
CONSIDERATION THAT SHOULD

01:54:06.005 --> 01:54:08.007
ABSOLUTELY AFFECT THE OFFICERS

01:54:08.074 --> 01:54:09.576
ASSESSMENT OF THE THREAT.

01:54:09.642 --> 01:54:11.311
POSED OR THE NEED TO OVERCOME

01:54:11.377 --> 01:54:12.679
RESISTANCE BUT THAT SHOULD NOT

01:54:12.745 --> 01:54:14.247
BE AN INDEPENDENT CONSIDERATION.

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:15.782
AN OFFICER MAY RIGHTLY EXPECT TO

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:17.650
USE MORE FORCE RESPONDING TO A

01:54:17.717 --> 01:54:18.985
REPORTED SHOOTING INTO A NOISE

01:54:19.052 --> 01:54:22.522
COMPLAINT BUT AN OFFICER TRYING.

01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:23.856
TO MY APOLOGIES BUT AN OFFICER

01:54:23.923 --> 01:54:25.725
TRYING TO APPREHEND.

01:54:25.792 --> 01:54:27.994
AN ELDERLY ON ARM SUSPECT IN A

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:29.329
FORTY YEAR OLD MURDER CASE WOULD

01:54:29.395 --> 01:54:31.364
CONSIDER MORE IN EVALUATING THE

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:32.699
THREAT THAN JUST THE SERIOUSNESS

01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:34.267
OF THE SUSPECTED OFFENSE.

01:54:34.334 --> 01:54:35.568
AND FORCE USED TO GAIN

01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:36.803
COMPLIANCE SHOULD CONSIDER THE

01:54:36.869 --> 01:54:38.338
SERIOUSNESS OF OFFENSE AND

01:54:38.404 --> 01:54:39.472
DEGREE OF RESISTANCE TO AVOID

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:41.207
USING SIGNIFICANT FORCE AGAINST

01:54:41.274 --> 01:54:42.809
AN INDIVIDUAL SUSPECTED OF ONLY

01:54:42.875 --> 01:54:44.177
A MINOR INFRACTION.

01:54:44.244 --> 01:54:45.245
BUT SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER

01:54:45.311 --> 01:54:47.580
MITIGATING SUBS CIRCUMSTANCES OR

01:54:47.647 --> 01:54:49.015
VULNERABILITIES OF THE SUBJECT

01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:50.283
AN OFFICER SHOULD NOT USE

01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:52.051
SERIOUS FOR FORCE AGAINST AN

01:54:52.118 --> 01:54:54.220
ELDERLY PERSON OR PREGNANT WOMAN

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:55.822
EVEN IN THE FACE OF A

01:54:55.888 --> 01:54:58.391
CATEGORICAL REFUSAL TO COOPERATE.

01:54:58.458 --> 01:55:00.493
THE PROPORTIONALITY TERM SHOULD

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:03.029
BE AMENDED TO REFLECT THAT.

01:55:03.096 --> 01:55:04.364
FINALLY IN OUR LETTER WE HAVE

01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:05.331
MADE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS WE

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:06.566
BELIEVE WOULD INCLUDE PROVEN

01:55:06.633 --> 01:55:08.434
CLARIFY THE BILL CLARIFYING THE

01:55:08.501 --> 01:55:10.169
MANDATE ON POLICIES REQUIRING DE

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:12.472
ESCALATION -- THAT THAT SHOULD

01:55:12.538 --> 01:55:14.140
INCLUDE LESS LETHAL FORCE THAT

01:55:14.207 --> 01:55:15.174
THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:16.409
DEADLY FORCE SHOULD NOT REQUIRE

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:17.877
OFFICERS TO MAKE A CALL ON

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:19.646
WHETHER FORCES EXCESSIVE.

01:55:19.712 --> 01:55:20.179
AND LEAVE THAT TO THEIR

01:55:20.246 --> 01:55:21.781
SUPERVISORS THE TRAINING

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:23.483
REQUIREMENTS ON DE ESCALATION

01:55:23.549 --> 01:55:24.951
AND COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:26.486
SEPARATED FOR CLARITY.

01:55:26.552 --> 01:55:27.420
THESE ARE NOT THE BASIS OF OUR

01:55:27.487 --> 01:55:29.155
OPPOSITION BUT OUR EFFORTS TO

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:31.391
IMPROVE THE BILL.

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:32.458
WE KNOW WITH AN INCREDIBLE

01:55:32.525 --> 01:55:33.960
AMOUNT OF ENERGY HAS GONE INTO

WE SHOULD NOT UNDO THE GOOD WORK

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:40.033
THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY LETTING

01:55:40.099 --> 01:55:41.200
HARMFUL POLICIES IN AT THE

01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:42.935
ELEVENTH HOUR AND WE URGE THE

LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES AS

BY ACLU BUT QUITE FRANKLY.

01:58:01.574 --> 01:58:02.542
THE LIST THAT I HAVE.

01:58:02.608 --> 01:58:04.944
HEARD TODAY IS LONGER THAN THE

01:58:40.847 --> 01:58:42.515
LOT OF WORK PUT INTO THAT -- AND

YESTERDAY WE STOOD ON THE FLOOR

AND WE HAD A MOMENT OF SILENCE

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:54.827
FOR TERROR O'SULLIVAN WHO PASSED

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:56.662

SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:59.298
AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:58:59.365 --> 01:59:00.466
THAT WE REMEMBER THE LIVES THAT

01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:01.934
ARE TAKEN ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:03.369
SIDE AS WELL AND I THINK THE

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:04.704
DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK.

01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:07.640
ON SB TWO THIRTY AND AB THREE

01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:08.741
NINETY TWO HONORED.

01:59:08.808 --> 01:59:10.343
THE LIVES LOST ON BOTH SIDES AND

01:59:10.409 --> 01:59:11.878
I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE AS A

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:12.812
COMMITTEE.

01:59:12.879 --> 01:59:14.413
AND LEADERSHIP AND THE AUTHORS

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:16.349
WORKED SO HARD TO GET TO TO MAKE

01:59:16.415 --> 01:59:17.583
SURE THAT WE HAD A BILL THE

01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:18.317
MAJOR THAT.

01:59:18.384 --> 01:59:20.419
USE DEADLY FORCE WAS ONLY USED

01:59:20.486 --> 01:59:21.787
WHEN NECESSARY.

01:59:21.854 --> 01:59:22.622
WE GAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT THE

01:59:22.688 --> 01:59:24.957
TRAINING THEY WERE ASKING FOR

01:59:25.024 --> 01:59:26.192
THE ONLY TIME.

01:59:26.259 --> 01:59:27.059
I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE SIX MONTHS

01:59:27.126 --> 01:59:28.594
BUT ONCE SOMEBODY'S COMING TO MY

01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:29.662
OFFICE AND SAID.

01:59:29.729 --> 01:59:31.697
WE COULD DO BETTER WE WANT TO DO

01:59:31.764 --> 01:59:33.499
BETTER GIVE US TRAINING AND I

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:35.601
SAID WOW WHO'S WE HAVE SOMEBODY

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:36.602
WHO'S ADMITTING THEY WANT TO DO

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:38.471
BETTER AND I WILL HAPPILY JOIN

01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:39.705
YOU IN MAKING SURE YOU DO BETTER

01:59:39.772 --> 01:59:41.340
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

01:59:41.407 --> 01:59:43.042
AND SO I HOPE WE CAN MOVE

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:44.844
FORWARD TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN

01:59:44.911 --> 01:59:46.612
BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:48.447

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:49.949
CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO

01:59:50.016 --> 01:59:51.984

02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:56.749
EVERYBODY ALL EYES ARE ON US.

02:05:56.815 --> 02:05:58.217
EVERYBODY'S WATCHING TO SEE WHAT

02:05:58.284 --> 02:05:59.818
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

02:05:59.885 --> 02:06:02.087
AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:06:02.154 --> 02:06:02.855
DO SOMETHING.

02:06:02.922 --> 02:06:05.591
IS UNBELIEVABLY SIGNIFICANT AND

02:06:05.658 --> 02:06:06.592
WE NEED.

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:08.227
TO TAKE CREDIT FOR IT.

02:06:08.294 --> 02:06:09.995
AND STOP IN FIGHTING WITH ONE

02:06:10.062 --> 02:06:11.730
ANOTHER AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:13.299
MAKE SURE THIS IS THE MOST

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:14.767
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM.

02:06:14.833 --> 02:06:16.135
BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

02:06:16.201 --> 02:06:17.503
IS THE IMPLEMENTATION.

02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:18.971
WITHOUT A DOUBT WE DON'T

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:20.639
IMPLEMENT THIS RIGHT.

02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:23.742

02:06:23.809 --> 02:06:26.478
THE HE THE THREATS ALL OF THE

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:29.214

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:31.183
COMMITTEE.

02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:32.651
EVERYONE HAS LOOKED AT BOTH

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:35.120
BILLS HAD LOOKED AT THE AT EVERY

02:06:35.187 --> 02:06:36.855
WORD.

02:06:36.922 --> 02:06:39.491
AND WHEN I SAY WE DEBATED EVERY

02:06:39.558 --> 02:06:42.127
WORD.

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:43.662

02:06:46.732 --> 02:06:47.666
BILLS.

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:49.134
SO THIS BILL HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY

02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:50.869
VETTED BY EVERYBODY ON THIS

02:06:50.936 --> 02:06:51.737

02:07:02.247 --> 02:07:04.249
RECOMMEND IN HIGH VOTE.

02:07:04.316 --> 02:07:04.750

THE MORNING COMMITTEE HI MY NAME

IS MELISSA O'CONNELL I'M AN

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.041
ATTORNEY WITH THE NORTHERN

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:11.276
CALIFORNIA INNOCENCE PROJECT AND

02:09:11.343 --> 02:09:12.578
I'M ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

02:09:12.644 --> 02:09:14.713
THE TWO OTHER INNOCENTS PROJECTS

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:16.515
IN CALIFORNIA -- WRONGFUL

02:09:16.582 --> 02:09:19.251
CONVICTIONS DON'T START AT A

02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:21.854
TRIAL -- THE COMPANY IN ONE

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.021
PHONE FOUR CONVICTIONS TYPICALLY

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:24.823
HAPPEN BECAUSE AN INVESTIGATION

02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:26.925
HAS GONE AWRY AND SO ACCESS TO

02:09:26.992 --> 02:09:30.529
PRE TRIAL DOCUMENTS IS CRITICAL

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:31.530
TO A POST CONVICTION REVIEW.

02:09:31.597 --> 02:09:33.732
HOWEVER IT TAKES OUR OFFICES

02:09:33.799 --> 02:09:35.134
THREE TO FOUR YEARS TO REVIEW

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.369
OUR CLIENTS CASES -- BECAUSE

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:39.705
WORD WORKING WITH INCOMPLETES OR

02:09:39.771 --> 02:09:41.406
PIECEMEAL FILES BECAUSE OUR

02:09:41.473 --> 02:09:43.275
CLIENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

02:09:43.342 --> 02:09:44.243
POST CONVICTION DISCOVERY.

02:09:44.309 --> 02:09:46.411
UP UNTIL LAST YEAR ONLY INMATES

02:09:46.478 --> 02:09:47.913
SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT THE

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:49.915
POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE OR CAPITAL

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:51.550
PUNISHMENT HAD RIGHT TO POST

02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:52.818
CONVICTION DOCUMENTS.

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:54.119
BUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE

02:09:54.186 --> 02:09:55.387
LAST THIRTY YEARS OF INNOCENCE

02:09:55.454 --> 02:09:56.889
WORK IS THAT OUR CLIENTS ARE

02:09:56.955 --> 02:09:58.724
MORE OFTEN SENTENCED TO HIGH

02:09:58.790 --> 02:10:01.260
DETERMINATE SENTENCES OR FIFTEEN

02:10:01.326 --> 02:10:03.095
OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE.

02:10:03.162 --> 02:10:04.530
PUTTING THEM OUTSIDE THAT RIGHT.

02:10:04.596 --> 02:10:06.064
THAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR LAST

02:10:06.131 --> 02:10:08.500
YEAR IS AB NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN

02:10:08.567 --> 02:10:09.601
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY

02:10:09.668 --> 02:10:11.436
WHICH EXPAND EXTENDED THE

02:10:11.503 --> 02:10:12.905
CATEGORY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:10:12.971 --> 02:10:14.439
COULD SEEK DISCOVERY.

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:16.108
HOWEVER THE LAW AND ITS CURRENT

02:10:16.175 --> 02:10:17.943
FORM HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO

02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:19.945
LITIGATION SUGGESTING THAT ONLY

02:10:20.012 --> 02:10:22.047
THOSE INMATES CONVICTED AS OF

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:23.482
JANUARY ONE OF THIS YEAR.

02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:25.083
COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS CHANGE

02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:25.851
IN THE LAW.

02:10:25.918 --> 02:10:27.619
BUT WE KNOW IS A STATE THAT

02:10:27.686 --> 02:10:28.453
THERE ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:30.122
CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN OUR

02:10:30.189 --> 02:10:31.089
PRISONS.

02:10:31.156 --> 02:10:32.424
I WANTED TO JUST GIVE A BRIEF

02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:34.660
EXAMPLE WE HAVE A CLIENT WHO WAS

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:37.229
SENTENCED TO THIRTY TWO YEARS TO

02:10:37.296 --> 02:10:38.931
LIFE IN STATE PRISON -- WHEN WE

02:10:38.997 --> 02:10:45.070
GOT INVOLVED IN HER CASE -- I A

02:10:45.137 --> 02:10:45.604
LAWYER HAD PASSED AWAY.

02:10:45.671 --> 02:10:46.705
THE STATE COURT HAD DESTROYED

02:10:46.772 --> 02:10:47.206
THEIR FILE AND THE TRIAL

02:10:47.272 --> 02:10:48.307
EXHIBITS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IN

02:10:48.373 --> 02:10:49.675
HER CASE.

02:10:49.741 --> 02:10:51.143
THE STATE DENIED US ACCESS TO

02:10:51.210 --> 02:10:52.611
POST CONVICTION DISCOVERY

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:53.979
BECAUSE HER SENTENCE FELL

02:10:54.046 --> 02:10:56.882
OUTSIDE OF EXISTING LAW.

02:10:56.949 --> 02:11:00.052
I'M CARLA SPENT SEVENTEEN YEARS

02:11:00.118 --> 02:11:01.286
WRONGFULLY INCARCERATED AND THE

02:11:01.353 --> 02:11:02.854
AND ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF OF

02:11:02.921 --> 02:11:04.590
THOSE YEARS WERE SPENT BEHIND US

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:05.791
TRYING TO INVESTIGATE AND

02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:08.961
LITIGATE HER CASE UNTIL SHE WAS

02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:10.829
EXONERATED TWO MONTHS AGO -- WE

02:11:10.896 --> 02:11:12.431
TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY VERY

02:11:12.497 --> 02:11:13.966
SERIOUSLY AS INNOCENCE PROJECTS

02:11:14.032 --> 02:11:15.701
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

02:11:15.767 --> 02:11:17.069
VICTIMS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

02:11:17.135 --> 02:11:19.071
THESE CASES AND THAT'S WHY A

02:11:19.137 --> 02:11:20.772
COMPLETE AND ACCURATE REVIEW OF

02:11:20.839 --> 02:11:22.407
THESE CASES IS CRITICAL.

02:11:22.474 --> 02:11:24.843
AND SB SIX FIFTY ONE ALLOWS US

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:25.911
TO DO THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:11:25.978 --> 02:11:26.878
RIGHT FOR CONVICTIONS REMAIN

02:11:26.945 --> 02:11:28.714
INTACT AND WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:31.083
ARE RECTIFIED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY

02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:32.017
AS POSSIBLE.

02:11:32.084 --> 02:11:32.284

COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY I'M

02:13:12.617 --> 02:13:15.687
PRESENTING -- SB SIXTY ONE WHICH

02:13:15.754 --> 02:13:17.622
BROKE WHICH PROHIBITS ANY PERSON

02:13:17.689 --> 02:13:19.224
FROM MAKING AN APPLICATION TO

02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:21.760

WITHIN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD

02:13:23.161 --> 02:13:24.730
FIREMAN'S WILL NOT BE DELIVERED

02:13:24.796 --> 02:13:26.631
WHATEVER THE DEALERS NOTIFY THE

02:13:26.698 --> 02:13:29.034
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT

02:13:29.101 --> 02:13:30.869
WITHIN THE PRECEDING THIRTY DAY.

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:32.137
THE PURCHASER HAD BAITED OTHER

02:13:32.204 --> 02:13:33.672
APPLICATION TO PURCHASE.

02:13:33.739 --> 02:13:36.208
A FIREARM IN NINETEEN NINETY

02:13:36.274 --> 02:13:37.242
NINE LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED TO

02:13:37.309 --> 02:13:39.211
LIMIT THE PURCHASE OF HANDGUNS

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:41.179
BUT RECENT DATA SUGGEST.

02:13:41.246 --> 02:13:42.247
THAT LONG GUNS ARE BECOMING A

02:13:42.314 --> 02:13:43.382
SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF

02:13:43.448 --> 02:13:45.550
CALIFORNIA'S GUN TRAFFICKING

02:13:45.617 --> 02:13:47.719
PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS

02:13:47.786 --> 02:13:49.354
CALIFORNIANS HAVE TYPICALLY

02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:51.123
PURCHASE MORE LONG GUNS AND HAND

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.957
GUNS.

02:13:52.023 --> 02:13:53.925
THERE'S NO REASON WHY SOMEONE

02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:56.061
WOULD NEED TO BUY MORE THAN ONE

02:13:56.128 --> 02:13:57.863
LONG GONE HER MONTHS PREVENTING

02:13:57.929 --> 02:13:59.464
THE FLOW OF GUNS IS IMPORTANT TO

02:13:59.531 --> 02:14:01.166
PUBLIC SAFETY REGARDLESS OF

02:14:01.233 --> 02:14:02.968
WHETHER THE FIREARM.

02:14:03.034 --> 02:14:04.703
IS A HANDGUN OR A LONG GUN -- OR

02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:06.505
PURCHASE NEW FROM A DEALER OR

02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:09.074
THROUGH A PRIVATE TRANSACTION

02:14:09.141 --> 02:14:11.042
LIMITED FIREARM SALES TO ONE GUN

02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:12.477
PER MONTH IS A RECOGNIZED

02:14:12.544 --> 02:14:14.146
STRATEGY. TO REDUCE GUN

02:14:14.212 --> 02:14:16.615
TRAFFICKING AND KEEP FIREARMS

02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:19.251
OUT OF DANGEROUS HANDS THE BILL

02:14:19.317 --> 02:14:21.286
WAS ALSO RECENTLY AMENDED TO

02:14:21.353 --> 02:14:23.188

TODAY I HAVE.

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:46.978
A MANDATE FROM THE BRADY

02:14:47.045 --> 02:14:48.213
CAMPAIGN UNITED AGAINST GUN

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.615
VIOLENCE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:53.084
SB SIXTY ONE WE THINK CUTTING

02:14:53.151 --> 02:14:54.953
DOWN ON BULK PURCHASES IS A GOOD

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:55.587
IDEA.

02:14:55.654 --> 02:14:57.722
AND OBVIOUSLY WOULD RESPECTFULLY

02:14:57.789 --> 02:14:58.390
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN

02:14:58.457 --> 02:14:59.291
APPROPRIATE.

THANK YOU YES GOOD MORNING.

02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:03.895
AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY

02:15:03.962 --> 02:15:05.330
CALIFORNIA.

02:15:05.397 --> 02:15:06.765
SO IN GENERAL OF BRADY

02:15:06.832 --> 02:15:08.567
CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THAT HAND

02:15:08.633 --> 02:15:10.402
GUNS AND LONG GUNS SHOULD BE

02:15:10.469 --> 02:15:12.037
SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAWS.

02:15:12.103 --> 02:15:13.705
IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE

02:15:13.772 --> 02:15:16.641
LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED THAT CAP --

02:15:16.708 --> 02:15:20.779
THE NUMBER OF HANDGUNS THAT

02:15:20.846 --> 02:15:21.480
COULD BE.

02:15:21.546 --> 02:15:23.582
PURCHASED IN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD

02:15:23.648 --> 02:15:24.683
TWO ONE HAND GUN PER MONTH PER

02:15:24.749 --> 02:15:26.418
BUYER PER MONTH -- IN THE

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:29.287
PURPOSE OF THAT IS.

02:15:29.354 --> 02:15:30.722
TO PREVENT THE TRACK OF

02:15:30.789 --> 02:15:33.225
TRAFFICKING OF HANDGUNS IT

02:15:33.291 --> 02:15:35.227
STANDS TO REASON -- THAT OF

02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:37.128
SOMEONE IS BUYING FIFTY GUNS AT

02:15:37.195 --> 02:15:38.864
ONCE THERE MOST LIKELY TURN

02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:40.398
AROUND AND SELLING THEM ON THE

02:15:40.465 --> 02:15:43.468
BLACK MARKET FOR PROFIT -- WE

02:15:43.535 --> 02:15:45.036
OBVIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THAT SAME

02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:47.105
CAPTION APPLIED TO LONG GUNS

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:49.074
BASED ON A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:51.443
REQUEST THAT -- MY HUSBAND AND I

02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:52.544
DID WITH THE CALIFORNIA

02:15:52.611 --> 02:15:54.012
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE A NUMBER

02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:57.382
OF YEARS AGO WE FOUND THAT

02:15:57.449 --> 02:15:58.850
EIGHTY ONE POINT 9% OF LONG GUNS

02:15:58.917 --> 02:16:00.018
WERE SOLD AS A SINGLE

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:01.253
TRANSACTION.

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:03.054
SO THEREFORE MOST LONGER BUYERS

02:16:03.121 --> 02:16:05.690
WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS LAW

02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:06.925
HOWEVER AT THE OTHER END OF THE

02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:08.827
SPECTRUM ONE INDIVIDUAL PURCHASE

02:16:08.894 --> 02:16:10.362
A HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN LONG

02:16:10.428 --> 02:16:11.463
GUNS AND ONE MONTH.

02:16:11.530 --> 02:16:13.431
FURTHER WE FOUND THAT WHEN GUNS

02:16:13.498 --> 02:16:16.067
WERE ACQUIRED LONG GUNS WORK

02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:17.369
WIRED -- WITH A BALL PURCHASE

02:16:17.435 --> 02:16:19.237
THERE MOST LIKELY TO BE LOWER

02:16:19.304 --> 02:16:21.106
RECEIVERS WHICH AGAIN CAN BE

02:16:21.172 --> 02:16:23.508
SOLD PERHAPS ON THE BLACK MARKET

02:16:23.575 --> 02:16:24.776
AND BUILD UP INTO.

02:16:24.843 --> 02:16:26.845
ILLEGAL ASSAULT WEAPONS -- SO WE

02:16:26.912 --> 02:16:28.713
CONSIDER THIS TO BE A GOOD

02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:31.316
STRATEGY FOR CURBING GUN

02:16:31.383 --> 02:16:33.385
TRAFFICKING AND REDUCING OUR THE

02:16:33.451 --> 02:16:35.220
PLAY WE HAVE OF ILLEGAL GUNS.

02:16:35.287 --> 02:16:36.454
AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT

02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:37.689
OUT BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THE

02:16:37.756 --> 02:16:39.724
CONCERNED REPEATEDLY IN THIS

02:16:39.791 --> 02:16:41.560
COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW ARE WE

02:16:41.626 --> 02:16:43.495
IMPACTING LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:44.296
AND ARE WE HAVING

02:16:44.362 --> 02:16:46.064
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON

02:16:46.131 --> 02:16:47.432
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WITH OUR

02:16:47.499 --> 02:16:48.066
LAWS.

02:16:48.133 --> 02:16:49.968
AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

02:16:50.035 --> 02:16:51.970
THIS BILL PLACES THE BURDEN ON

02:16:52.037 --> 02:16:53.939
THE GUN DEALER THEY'RE THE ONES

02:16:54.005 --> 02:16:55.407
WHO CANNOT MAKE THE SALE WHEN

02:16:55.473 --> 02:16:59.277
THEY'RE NOTIFIED BY DOJ THAT --

02:16:59.344 --> 02:17:00.545
THAT THE PERSON'S ALREADY AND

02:17:00.612 --> 02:17:02.180
PURCHASE A GUN WITHIN THE LAST

02:17:02.247 --> 02:17:03.682
OUR THIRTY DAY PERIOD SO THE

02:17:03.748 --> 02:17:06.351
BURDENS ON THE DEALER NOT ON THE

02:17:06.418 --> 02:17:07.886
INDIVIDUALS KNOWING THIS LAW.

02:17:07.953 --> 02:17:09.688
ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW FOR THAT

02:17:09.754 --> 02:17:11.690
MATTER AND THEN FINALLY -- THE

02:17:11.756 --> 02:17:14.059
CENTER MENTIONED THE THAT THE

02:17:14.125 --> 02:17:15.794
BILL WAS AMENDED TO NARROW THE

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:20.932
EXEMPTION THAT'LL THAT ALLOWS

02:17:20.999 --> 02:17:23.268
THOSE UNDER AGE TWENTY ONE TO

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:24.102
BUY CINEMA SEMI AUTOMATIC

02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:25.537
CENTERFIRE RIFLE WHICH SADLY

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:26.438
SEEMS TO BE THE WEAPON OF CHOICE --

02:17:26.504 --> 02:17:27.706
IN TODAY'S MASS SHOOTINGS THERE

02:17:27.772 --> 02:17:29.207
ARE STILL WAYS THERE ARE

02:17:29.274 --> 02:17:32.544
EXEMPTIONS -- FOR THOSE UNDER

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:34.045
TWENTY ONE TO ACQUIRE A FIREARM.

THEY CAN OBTAIN SUCH A GUN WE

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.622
THINK THAT IS ALSO IN THE

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:45.624
INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:47.926
THIS COMMITTEE HAS PASSED A LAW

02:17:47.993 --> 02:17:48.660

02:19:36.468 --> 02:19:38.103
CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO HUNDREDS

02:19:38.169 --> 02:19:39.838
AND HUNDREDS OF GUN LAWS AND

02:19:39.904 --> 02:19:41.673
THIS IS A CONCEPT WE HAVE HEARD

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:43.641
BEFORE ON FARM RATIONING AND AND

02:19:43.708 --> 02:19:44.809
THIS IS ONE MORE LAW THAT'S

02:19:44.876 --> 02:19:45.877
THAT'S FOCUSED ON LAW ABIDING

02:19:45.944 --> 02:19:48.179
CITIZENS WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS.

02:19:48.246 --> 02:19:50.181
THAT -- WHEN IT COMES TO

02:19:50.248 --> 02:19:51.382
PURCHASING A FIREARM YOU NEED A

02:19:51.449 --> 02:19:53.351
FARM SAFETY CERTIFICATE YOU NEED

02:19:53.418 --> 02:19:54.352
TO UNDERGO A BACKGROUND CHECK

02:19:54.419 --> 02:19:55.820
PHILIP A FEDERAL PAPERWORK STATE

02:19:55.887 --> 02:19:57.722
PAPERWORK -- UNDERGO A TEN DAY

02:19:57.789 --> 02:19:59.457
WAITING PERIOD WE ALSO OF LAWS

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:00.925
DEALING WITH TRAFFICKING OF

02:20:00.992 --> 02:20:02.427
FIREARMS WITH STRAW PURCHASES.

02:20:02.494 --> 02:20:04.162
AND THIS LAWS IS REALLY FOCUSED

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:05.730
ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS BECAUSE

02:20:05.797 --> 02:20:08.133
CRIMINALS WHO ARE OUT THERE

02:20:08.199 --> 02:20:09.267
ACQUIRING FIREARMS REALISTIC

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:11.369
MEANS OR WHO MAY BE TRAFFICKING

02:20:11.436 --> 02:20:12.170
FIREARMS.

02:20:12.237 --> 02:20:15.840
OR ACQUIRING THEM THROUGH STRAW

02:20:15.907 --> 02:20:17.742
PURCHASE OR ANY ANY OF THE THE

02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:18.309
THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:20:18.376 --> 02:20:18.977
TARGET ARE NOT GONNA BE IMPACTED

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:19.577
BY THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE NEVER

02:20:19.644 --> 02:20:20.145
GOING TO GO TO A DEALER TO

02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:20.411
PURCHASE.

02:20:20.478 --> 02:20:21.913
A FIREARM THEY'RE OPERATING

02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.281
OUTSIDE THE LAW THIS IS FOCUS ON

02:20:23.348 --> 02:20:24.883
LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AND I THINK

02:20:24.949 --> 02:20:25.984
WE SHOULD REALLY FOCUS ON THE

02:20:26.050 --> 02:20:27.285
CRIMINAL MISUSE OF FIREARM.

02:20:27.352 --> 02:20:29.654
RATHER THAN ADDING ONE MORE LAW

02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:30.522
ON THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT

02:20:30.588 --> 02:20:32.190
THERE WHO MAY BE ACQUIRING MORE

02:20:32.257 --> 02:20:33.658
THAN ONE FIREARM FOR A VARIETY

02:20:33.725 --> 02:20:35.894
OF PURPOSES -- INCLUDING -- COST

02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:37.495
SAVINGS TIME SAVING SIX CETERA

02:20:37.562 --> 02:20:39.430
BECAUSE PURCHASING A FIREARM THE

02:20:39.497 --> 02:20:41.699
STATE IS IS A COSTLY PROCESS AND

02:20:41.766 --> 02:20:43.334
IT REQUIRES MULTIPLE TRIPS THE

02:20:43.401 --> 02:20:45.336
TO A DEALER AND AND SO SOMETIMES

02:20:45.403 --> 02:20:46.404
IT'S A CONVENIENT SAYING

02:20:46.471 --> 02:20:47.338
SOMETIMES IT'S YOU'RE GETTING

02:20:47.405 --> 02:20:48.173
INTO A COMPETITIVE SHOOTING

02:20:48.239 --> 02:20:49.641
SPORTS THAT MIGHT REQUIRE MORE

02:20:49.707 --> 02:20:50.642
THAN ONE FIREARM.

02:20:50.708 --> 02:20:51.643
AND SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD

02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:52.777
REALLY FOCUS ON THE CRIMINAL

02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:54.546
MISUSE RATHER THAN THOSE WHO ARE

02:20:54.612 --> 02:20:55.947
COMPLYING WITH OUR LAWS HERE IN

02:20:56.014 --> 02:20:57.549

THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE VERY

02:21:51.336 --> 02:21:52.971
BEGINNING OF NEXT SESSION WHICH

02:21:53.037 --> 02:21:56.674
BEGINS IN OCTOBER.

02:21:56.741 --> 02:21:57.842
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM

02:21:57.909 --> 02:21:59.777
COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible]

02:21:59.844 --> 02:22:01.346
YES.

02:22:01.412 --> 02:22:04.415
I'M THANK YOU I HAD -- TWO

02:22:04.482 --> 02:22:05.950
QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS JUST TO

02:22:06.017 --> 02:22:09.787
CLARIFY DOES THIS IMPACT -- THE

02:22:09.854 --> 02:22:14.259
FOLKS WHO WILL SELL -- WHO ARE

02:22:14.325 --> 02:22:16.761
BUYING -- WHO ARE ALSO PART OF A

02:22:16.828 --> 02:22:18.396
BUY BACK PROGRAM [inaudible]

02:22:18.463 --> 02:22:20.932
NO.

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:22.433
SOME PART OF A BUY BACK PROGRAM

02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:24.502
OKAY SO THIS WOULD THAT'S A LIKE

02:22:24.569 --> 02:22:25.169
A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S RIGHT

02:22:25.236 --> 02:22:26.304
RIGHT NOW IT WOULD NOT IMPACT

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:27.071
THAT AT ALL OKAY.

02:22:27.138 --> 02:22:28.506
AND THOSE HAVE BEEN VERY

02:22:28.573 --> 02:22:30.675
SUCCESSFUL IN SEVERAL OF BEEN.

02:22:30.742 --> 02:22:31.609
DONE IN MY DISTRICT.

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:33.378
OKAY SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY

02:22:33.444 --> 02:22:35.113
BECAUSE MOST FOLKS WHO ARE.

02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:36.381
GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN A BUY

02:22:36.447 --> 02:22:38.182
BACK PROGRAM MAY HAVE MORE THAN

02:22:38.249 --> 02:22:39.550
ONE GUN.

02:22:39.617 --> 02:22:43.454
THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHY ARE --

02:22:43.521 --> 02:22:46.157
WHY IS THERE AN EXEMPTION -- TO

02:22:46.224 --> 02:22:51.629
VETERANS AND THOSE -- WHO ARE?

02:22:51.696 --> 02:22:54.065
HAVE AN ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN

02:22:54.132 --> 02:22:56.968
ARMED FORCES NATIONAL GUARD --

02:22:57.035 --> 02:22:59.537
NATIONAL GUARD. FOR TWO REASONS

02:22:59.604 --> 02:23:01.572
TO STATISTICALLY THEY TEND NOT

02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:02.607
TO BE THE BULK PURCHASERS WHO

02:23:02.674 --> 02:23:04.575
ARE RESELLING THE GUNS TO THE

02:23:04.642 --> 02:23:06.511
NEFARIOUS HANDS AND WE JUST

02:23:06.577 --> 02:23:07.211
THOUGHT IT WAS A PRUDENT

02:23:07.278 --> 02:23:08.913
EXEMPTION THAT'S NOT WHERE THE

02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:11.349
PROBLEM LIES.

02:23:11.416 --> 02:23:13.484
OKAY THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE

02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:17.488
I GUESS THREE OF THE TEN MOST

02:23:17.555 --> 02:23:19.857
DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTINGS --

02:23:19.924 --> 02:23:20.658
OCCURRED BY FOLKS WHO ARE

02:23:20.725 --> 02:23:22.627
VETERANS AND SO I CERTAINLY

02:23:22.694 --> 02:23:23.861
CONSIDER THEM TO BE PART OF THE

02:23:23.928 --> 02:23:25.330
CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:26.731
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:23:26.798 --> 02:23:28.900
FIREARM SAFETY AND GUN VIOLENCE

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:31.936
PREVENTION.

02:23:32.003 --> 02:23:34.105
ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

02:23:34.172 --> 02:23:39.877
COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- YOU MAKE.

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:40.778
EIGHT YOU MAY CLOSE I WAS GONNA

02:23:40.845 --> 02:23:40.945
DO.

02:23:41.012 --> 02:23:42.613
MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD COMMENT

02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:44.716
ON TWO OF THE OTHER POINTS.

02:23:44.782 --> 02:23:46.184
THAT WERE MADE BY THE OPPOSITION.

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:47.752
OBVIOUSLY THE HANDGUN LAW THAT

02:23:47.819 --> 02:23:50.355
WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY

02:23:50.421 --> 02:23:51.823
NINE HAS NOT BEEN CHALLENGED --

02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:53.958
AND SO THAT'S BEEN UPHELD. FOR A

02:23:54.025 --> 02:23:55.560
LONG TIME SO WE DON'T ANTICIPATE

02:23:55.626 --> 02:23:57.028
THAT BEING.

02:23:57.095 --> 02:23:58.830
AN ISSUE AND FRANKLY IT'S THE

02:23:58.896 --> 02:24:00.798
BALL PURCHASES THAT WE'RE TRYING

02:24:00.865 --> 02:24:02.233
TO GET AT AND THAT'S WHERE --

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:04.135
THE BAD GUYS DO GET THE GUNS

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:05.770
FROM THOSE BOB FOR PURCHASE

02:24:05.837 --> 02:24:06.971
PURSES SO WE THINK IT'S A

02:24:07.038 --> 02:24:09.107
PRINTING AND WITH THAT I'LL

02:24:09.173 --> 02:24:10.942
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

02:24:11.009 --> 02:24:13.011
THANK YOU AND I I THINK THE THE

02:24:13.077 --> 02:24:13.578
REASON I ASK THE OPPOSITION

02:24:13.644 --> 02:24:15.113
ABOUT.

02:24:15.179 --> 02:24:16.581
NGUYEN SUPREME COURT WOULD RULE

02:24:16.647 --> 02:24:19.717

THE SECOND MINUTE TALK ABOUT

02:24:28.559 --> 02:24:30.795
REGULATED MILITIA SO -- I THINK

02:24:30.862 --> 02:24:32.997
RIGHT NOW TODAY -- BASED ON THE

02:24:33.064 --> 02:24:34.799
SECOND AMENDMENT WE HAVE THAT.

02:24:34.866 --> 02:24:38.236
ABILITY TO REGULATE -- HOW WE

FOR BRINGING THIS BILL.

02:36:55.606 --> 02:36:56.707
THE COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT

02:36:56.774 --> 02:36:58.942
ARE WORKING TO PASS A STORAGE

02:36:59.009 --> 02:37:00.177
ORDINANCES BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

02:37:00.244 --> 02:37:01.578
DONE IT IS A STATE.

02:37:01.645 --> 02:37:02.813
AND TWO CITIES HAVE PASSED IT

02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:03.914
OTHERS ARE WORKING ON IT BUT THE

02:37:03.981 --> 02:37:05.415
PATCHWORK IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE

02:37:05.482 --> 02:37:06.617
COMPLICATED I THINK THEN ASKED

02:37:06.683 --> 02:37:07.951
STEPPING UP AND DOING IT ON A

02:37:08.018 --> 02:37:09.319
STATEWIDE BASIS.

02:37:09.386 --> 02:37:11.388
AS A MOTHER I KNOW THAT WHEN IT

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:12.523
COMES TO FIREARMS ONE OF THE

02:37:12.589 --> 02:37:15.025
GREATEST RISKS THAT MY KIDS FACE

02:37:15.092 --> 02:37:16.260
IS ON PLAY DATES WHERE THEY

02:37:16.326 --> 02:37:17.928
MIGHT ENCOUNTER AND UNLOCKED.

02:37:17.995 --> 02:37:20.597
AND FIREARM THAT IS LOADED AND

02:37:20.664 --> 02:37:22.699
SO I'M NOT CRAZY MOM WHO ASKS

02:37:22.766 --> 02:37:23.300
BEFORE MY KIDS GOING TO PLAY

02:37:23.367 --> 02:37:23.934
DATE.

02:37:24.001 --> 02:37:25.035
BUT I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE'RE

02:37:25.102 --> 02:37:26.436
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP

02:37:26.503 --> 02:37:28.071
KIDS SAFE IN THE HOME BECAUSE

02:37:28.138 --> 02:37:29.406
THAT IS OUR JOB.

02:37:29.473 --> 02:37:31.408
AND AS TO THE OPPOSITION'S POINT

02:37:31.475 --> 02:37:32.476
ONE OF THE CITY COUNCILS THAT IN

02:37:32.543 --> 02:37:35.679
AN A PASSING ONE OF THESE

02:37:35.746 --> 02:37:37.381
ORDINANCES. ONE OF THE CITY

02:37:37.447 --> 02:37:37.981
COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO IS A GUN

02:37:38.048 --> 02:37:39.149
OWNER HAD CONCERNS ABOUT HER

02:37:39.216 --> 02:37:40.651
ABILITY TO ACCESS HER FIREARMS

02:37:40.717 --> 02:37:41.618
WAS LOCKED.

02:37:41.685 --> 02:37:43.220
AND THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO

02:37:43.287 --> 02:37:44.755
ARE PUSHING FOR IT GAVE HER A

02:37:44.822 --> 02:37:46.256
TRIGGER LOCK AND SAID WOULD YOU

02:37:46.323 --> 02:37:47.825
JUST GO HOME AND TRY THIS.

02:37:47.891 --> 02:37:49.226
AND SHE WENT HOME AND IN THE

02:37:49.293 --> 02:37:50.494
DARK JUNGLE IT'S OFF LIKE SHE

02:37:50.561 --> 02:37:52.229
WAS ASLEEP SHE COULD UNLOCK THAT

02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:53.864
GUN SO QUICKLY THAT SHE ENDED UP

02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:55.165
VOTING FOR THE ORDINANCE.

02:37:55.232 --> 02:37:55.999
SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:37:56.066 --> 02:37:57.701
DOES HAMPER THE ABILITY TO

02:37:57.768 --> 02:37:59.036
ACCESS A FIREARM JUST BECAUSE

02:37:59.102 --> 02:38:00.270
IT'S LOCKED WE HAVE.

02:38:00.337 --> 02:38:02.539
SUCH AMAZING TECHNOLOGY THESE

02:38:02.606 --> 02:38:03.607
DAYS WHERE YOU COME AGAIN USING

02:38:03.674 --> 02:38:05.042
YOUR FINGERPRINT IN A SECOND AND

02:38:05.108 --> 02:38:06.210
SO I JUST THINK.

02:38:06.276 --> 02:38:07.311
THAT THIS DOESN'T HAMPER ON THE

02:38:07.377 --> 02:38:08.378
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND WE

02:38:08.445 --> 02:38:10.180
HAVE LIVES AT RISK AND SO WE

02:38:10.247 --> 02:38:11.682
NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

02:38:11.748 --> 02:38:13.250
SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS --

02:38:13.317 --> 02:38:14.084
I WOULD LOVE TO BE A PRINCIPAL

02:38:14.151 --> 02:38:17.721
CO AUTHOR AND I HOPE EVERYONE

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.668

02:38:31.735 --> 02:38:33.937
UNFORTUNATELY I WILL NOT BE ABLE

02:38:34.004 --> 02:38:35.739
TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I AM VERY

02:38:35.806 --> 02:38:37.174
CONCERNED ABOUT ADDING

02:38:37.241 --> 02:38:40.077
ADDITIONAL CRIMES TO OUR LIST --

02:38:40.143 --> 02:38:42.813
AND THE PENAL CODE AND ALSO JUST

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:45.983

JUST SORT OF THIS STATE THAT

02:39:01.531 --> 02:39:03.600

02:53:10.146 --> 02:53:10.379
REFRESHING.

03:05:59.815 --> 03:06:01.083
PRISON MAKES NO SENSE.

03:06:01.149 --> 03:06:03.552

CLAIM THAT THE UNDERLYING

03:06:08.624 --> 03:06:11.293
PREMISE OF SB ONE THIRTY SIX IS

03:06:11.360 --> 03:06:12.761
THAT A RECALCITRANT CRIMINAL

03:06:12.828 --> 03:06:14.663
SHOULD BE SENTENCED THE SAME AS

03:06:14.730 --> 03:06:16.498
A FIRST TIME OFFENDER DESPITE A

03:06:16.565 --> 03:06:18.033
LENGTHY CRIMINAL HISTORY.

03:06:18.100 --> 03:06:20.302
THIS ARGUMENT IGNORES OTHER

03:06:20.369 --> 03:06:22.037
PROVISIONS THAT PROSECUTORS

03:06:22.104 --> 03:06:23.772

POINT FOUR TWO ONE BI THREE

03:06:27.409 --> 03:06:29.545
WHICH ALLOWS A JUDGE TO CONSIDER.

03:06:29.611 --> 03:06:30.779
A PRIOR PRISON TERM AN

03:06:30.846 --> 03:06:32.648
AGGRAVATING FACTOR TO INCREASE

03:06:32.714 --> 03:06:33.916
THE DEFENDANT'S SENTENCE.

03:06:33.982 --> 03:06:36.118
SB ONE THIRTY SIX DOES NOT TAKE

03:06:36.184 --> 03:06:37.319
AWAY THIS TOOL.

03:06:37.386 --> 03:06:38.887

ENHANCEMENTS.

03:06:40.122 --> 03:06:41.423
NOT ONLY ARE THE ARGUMENTS

AGAINST SB ONE THIRTY SIX

03:06:43.225 --> 03:06:45.928
DISINGENUOUS THEY ALSO IGNORE

03:06:45.994 --> 03:06:47.329
THE REALITY OF ENHANCEMENTS.

03:06:47.396 --> 03:06:49.097
THESE ENHANCEMENTS DO NOT REDUCE

03:06:49.164 --> 03:06:51.033
RECIDIVISM THEY ADD TO OUR

03:06:51.099 --> 03:06:52.734

03:06:52.801 --> 03:06:53.702

03:06:53.769 --> 03:06:54.970
IT IS NOW AN OFT CITED

03:07:00.809 --> 03:07:02.811
EVERY TIME ONE OF MY CLIENTS

03:07:02.878 --> 03:07:05.247

A PRISON TERM.

03:07:10.953 --> 03:07:13.288
I HAVE TO ADVISE THEM THAT A

03:07:13.355 --> 03:07:15.490
POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PLEA

03:07:15.557 --> 03:07:18.493
IS THAT A YEAR IN CUSTODY ABOVE

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:19.962

03:07:20.028 --> 03:07:22.064

03:07:22.130 --> 03:07:23.265
IN THE FUTURE.

03:07:23.332 --> 03:07:25.167
THAT IS BECAUSE IF A PERSON IS

03:07:25.233 --> 03:07:26.969
REVOKED ON PROBATION AND

03:07:27.035 --> 03:07:28.971
SUBSEQUENTLY GETS SENTENCED TO

03:07:29.037 --> 03:07:30.839
PRISON THAT TIME IN CUSTODY WILL

03:07:30.906 --> 03:07:33.642
ALSO COUNT AS A PRISON PRIOR.
