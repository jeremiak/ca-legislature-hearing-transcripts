FIVE NINE EIGHT THE FIRST MONTHS AND YEARS OF OUR LIVES ARE CRUCIAN DEVELOPING THE HEARING PATHWAYS IN OURBRAINS AND HANDS ARE OR LANGUAGE. THERE'S OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT THE CHILDREN DEPRIVE THE NORMAL ACCESS CITY HERE HAVE SIGNIFICANT SPEECH AN ORAL LANGUAGE THE LACE. THIS IMPACT THEIR ACADEMIC LIFE CAUSES PROBLEMS WITH SOCIAL INTERACTION AS WELL AS EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES. DEAF.

DEAR HEARING AFFECTION IN TURN INTERVENTION PROGRAM HAS INSTITUTED IS ONE THREE SIX GUIDELINES SCREENING BY ONE MONTH OF AGE DIAGNOSIS OF HEARING LOSS WITH THREE MONTHS OF AGE. AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT BY SIX MONTHS OF AGE. CALIFORNIA THOSE EAT BEAUTIFUL JOB IN SCREENING AND IDENTIFY OUR CHILDREN WITH HEARING LOSS BUT FAILS MISERABLY WHEN IT COMES TO TREATING THEM. I SEE THIS EVERY DAY WHEN I TAKE CARE CHILDREN WHO ARE HARD OF HEARING IT READ THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. I SEE THE DIFFERENCE THAT I HEAR RATE MAKES IN THE LIVES AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CHILDREN. HOWEVER BECAUSE ONLY ONE IN TEN CHILDREN HAVE HEARING AIDS COVERED BUTTER PRIVATE HEALTH PLAN IN CALIFORNIA.

WE ARE LUCKY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE INSURANCE HOWEVER THE DOCTORS JUST HOWEVER AFTER THE DOCTORS DISCOVERED THE HEARING LOSS. I FOUND OUT THAT MY INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER HEARING AID. FOR MY BOYS THE COST OF ONE PEDIATRIC HEARING AID IN ONE EAR IS SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THAT'S FOR ME IT WILL BE ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE COST DOES NOT INCLUDE THE MOLD THAT ARE REQUIRED TO HELP -- TO TED KINDA TRANSMIT THOSE HEARING AIDS THAT COST OF SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER YEAR AND THAT HAS TO BE REPLACED EVERY THREE MONTHS AS THESE CHILDREN ARE DEVELOPING. SO AT THIS POINT EVERY THREE MONTHS I HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN COSTS FOR MY CHILDREN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO HEAR AND DEVELOP LANGUAGE APPROPRIATELY.
