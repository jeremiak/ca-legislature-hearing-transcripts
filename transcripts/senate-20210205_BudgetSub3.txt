IN BUILDING A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. NOT REALLY BLACK CONTINUING TO HELP OUR FIVE. AT THE VARIOUS EFFORTS THAT HAVE.BEEN IN PLACE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE. ACCESS TO COVERAGE ACCESS TO CARE. WE'RE EQUALLY- FOCUSED ON INTEGRATING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. HI THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR WORK. AND IT CENTERS ON THE NOTION THAT. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE SERVING- WHO HAVE. BOTH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NEEDS. AND IT'S PARAMOUNT THAT WE LOOK AT THAT TURNED OT OF THEIR NEEDS- AND NOT. AT THE BUREAUCRATIC STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS. REALLY LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE WRAP OURSELVES AROUND. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING FORWARD ASKING FOR SERVICES FOR PROGRAMS. AND THINKING ABOUT THEIR NEEDS T AND THEN THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WRAP OURSELVES AROUND THEM. AND SO THE INTEGRATION OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THERE IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- YOU. GIVE SOMEONE HEALTH INSURER COVERAGE BUT IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO FOOD IF THEY KNOW HAVE ACCESS TO HOUSING IF THEY DON'T ACCESS TRANSPORTATION. THOSE ARE ALL PARAMOUNT. TRUSTING THOSE SOCIAL. OF HEALTH AND ALTERNATELY REALIZING SOME POSITIVE OUTCOMES ON THE HEALTH SIDE. ANSWER COLLECTIVELY THAT CONTINUES TO BE A PRIORITY RUN INTEGRATION. FINALLY IT'S REALLY ABOUT IMPROVING. THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG STATUS I'M DYING CLUNES. INDIVIDUALS WERE GETTING SERVICES FROM OUR DEPARTMENT OF HOMELESS SERVICES IT'S OUR FOSTER CHILDREN WHICH ARE OUR CHILDREN AND THEY AREN'T ALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND IS A PARAMOUNT THAT WE WORK TO ENSURE.

THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BOTH INTELLECTUAL AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES CT IN WAYS IN WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS FOR THEM AS WELL AND SO. IN TOTAL THOSE FOUR OUT FOR PRIORITIES REALLY INCOME PRESS ARE WORKING AND IT'S HOW WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THE BULK OF. THE VARIOUS PROJECT COMPONENTS ARE THERE ARE JUST NOT ONLY HERE WITH REGARDS TO THAT HHS SESSION TO YOUR HEARING AS PART OF THIS VERY BEGINNING. ALL TWELVE DEPARTMENTS AND FIVE OFFICES WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION WE WANT TO BE PERSON CENTRED WE WANT TO BE DATA DRIVEN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. AS PEOPLE ARE GETTING SERVICES. FROM US THAT THEY'RE GETTING. HIGH QUALITY SERVICES THAT WE HAVE. UP WITH OUR LOW. ARE AND ALLOW PIECE HERE IS A- OUR LOCAL. AND TELLS WHICH IS OUT WHICH IS SOMETHING VERY OF THIS HELPING YOU SERVICES. DELIVER BY AT THE STATE. AND THEY'RE NOT CENTRALIZE ACTUALLY. IN THE DELIVER CAL. AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND THAT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- IT EACH PROGRAM AND THEN HAS THE ABILITY TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY AND IT IS PARAMOUNT THAT WE CONTINUE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE COUNTY PARTNERS. SO ABDUCTOR A MINUTE I WILL START THERE AND WITH REGARDS TO THE OVERVIEW WHICH WAS ISSUE ONE. FIVE AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CENTER MELENDEZ HAS ANY QUESTIONS. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO. INTO ISSUE TOO ON YOUR AGENDA. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THIS TIME. MELISSA NOTHING FOR ME OKAY ALL RIGHT MY COLLEAGUES TO GET TALKER WITH THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION IS GOING TO TAKE LEAD AND PRESENTING TO YOU AND ANSWERING HER QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO SENT YET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO MY NAME IS CYNTHIA TUCKER WITH OFFICE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND I'M HERE TO DISCUSS THE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION PROJECT PHASE TWO OF OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST CONTINUES THE EXISTING TWENTY LONGER TERM RESOURCES FOR THE COMPLETION OF PLANNING EFFORTS AND ADDITIONAL CONTRACTOR RESOURCES TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- FOR THE FIRE. DEPARTMENTS PROGRAMS THAT ARE WITH THIS PROJECT THESE CONTINUE RESOURCES ARE SPECIALLY NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE IMPACTED BY THIS PROJECT AS WELL AS A VERY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE IN ORDER TO AVOID FURTHER FEDERAL PENALTIES. OUR SOLUTION THAT WE'RE BRINGING FORWARD- WILL NEED TO INTERFACE WITH MULTIPLE OTHER SYSTEMS INCLUDING- SOME DH YES SYSTEMS LIKE FEVER SERVICE MEDICARE. MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE- THE MEDI CAL DATA WAREHOUSE AND LSO WITH THE S. SYSTEMS FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS. IN OUR PLANNING PROCESS WE DETERMINE THAT THE STATE WILL USE AN OPEN TENDER MODEL- FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF EDV SIMILAR TO THE APPROACH BEING TAKEN OTHER STATES. AND THIS IS GOING TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO OUR PROVIDERS AND WILL ACCOMMODATE BOTH ARE AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE AS WELL AS THE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS THAT THIS PROJECT WILL SERVE. I'M CURRENTLY WE HAVE SUBMITTED OUR PAL STAGE THREE SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT- PACKAGE CHIU CDG IT WAS. SUBMITTED ON FEBRUARY FIRST. AND WORKING VERY CLEVERLY WAS CDG THE PROJECT WAS ABLE TO RELEASE THE PRIME VENDOR RFP- ON DECEMBER TWENTY THIRD OF TWENTY TWENTY- IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE SOLICITATION PROCESS AND SUPPORT THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE FEDERAL PENALTIES. THE ADDITIONAL CONTRACTOR RESOURCES MOSTLY FOR THE UNITY SOLUTION VENDOR AND SUPPORT CONTRACT COSTS. ARE NEEDED FOR THE SUCCESSFUL DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION PHASE OF THE PROJECT- THE ACTIVITIES THIS PHASE INCLUDES SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT CHANGES TO. THE SYSTEM THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER INTERFACES WITH NONSTATE ENTITIES AND CHANGES TO SYSTEMS JUST. ABOUT THE NEW DATA TO OUR FEDERAL PARTNER. I BELIEVE WE CAN GO INTO THAT SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. PARDON ME I'M. FINDING THE QUESTION. OKAY SO THAT WAS ABOUT HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW I DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT. OTHERWISE GOING INTO QUESTION TO WHAT IS THE CURRENT EXPECTED TIMELINE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION. SO THIS IS FOR BOTH PERSONAL CARE SERVICES AND HOME HEALTHCARE SERVICES. FOR PERSONAL CARE SERVICES PCS IMPLEMENTATION IS TARGETING BY THE END OF THIS YEAR BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OF FOR HOME HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE IMPLEMENTATION IS TARGETED FOR DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IN REGARDS TO EXPECTED TOTAL OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING PENALTIES FOR EDIE FACE TO PERSONAL CARE SERVICES IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE HAVE FEDERAL PENALTIES EXPECTED OF ELEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND. AND WITH EACH YEAR THE FEDERAL PENALTIES INCREASED BY POINT TWO FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS- GOING UP 21% ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO. THIS ITEM CAN I IF I IF I MAY ASK- SO IT IN TAKING ON THIS NEW BIG PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO MAKE US MORE EFFICIENT- WE'VE HAD A HISTORY MOST RECENTLY IT'S BEEN VERY APPARENT WHEN WE WHEN WE PUT NEW SYSTEMS A SPECIALIZED TRAINING SYSTEMS INTO PLACE. WHAT KIND OF CHECKS TO WE HAVE INTO PLACE TO MAKE SURE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD HISTORICALLY. WITH NEW ELECTRONIC PROGRAMS. WERE NOT CONNECT EXPERIENCE WITH THIS AND- AND CONTINUE TO ACCRUE A CREW. FEDERAL PENALTIES. I THINK ONE IS THE DEPARTMENTS AND ALWAYS SAW I HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY COLLABORATIVE LEADS TO DO SOME DETAILED ANALYSIS IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE AFFECTED XCERRA- AND LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN INTERFACE. WE ARE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF TESTING EFFORTS WERE GETTING UP. THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL A SOFTWARE IS A SOLUTION WE'RE NOT DOING CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT- FROM THE BEGINNING- WE'RE TRYING TO LEVERAGE EXISTING WORKERS ARE NET THAT'S OUT IN THE MARKET PLACE TO LEVERAGE- WHICH ALREADY DOES THIS WORK FOR OTHER STATES. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TO MITIGATE RISK. OKAY THURMOND AS ANYTHING. YES YOU CAN NOT AND SHOULD I JUST WANT TO DUMP HIM ON WHAT YOU WERE ASKING BECAUSE I'M YOU KNOW YOU GOT SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE- ABILITY TO ROLL THIS OUT IN A WAY THAT'S EFFECTIVE I'M GIVEN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND I JUST WANTED COULD YOU JUST PLEASE- IT EXPAND ON BLIND THERE ARE FEDERAL. FEDERAL PENALTIES. IN IT IS ONLY. QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S IS I MEAN YOU CAN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. WE JUST WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE ANOTHER- LAST WEEK WE'RE EXPERIENCING WITH EDT YOU COULD PROVIDE TO THAT THAT BE GREAT. SO WITH REGARDS TO THAT FEDERAL PENALTIES- ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION IS A REQUIREMENT UNDER THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CURES ACT. SO WHICH IS THE REASON WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH EBV IS TO MINIMIZE COUNTIES BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY GO UP. EACH YEAR- WITH REGARDS TO. YOUR COMMENT OR YOUR QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO. OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAVING ISSUES I THINK ONE FIRST AND FOREMOST IS A CURRENT- HOW DO YOU CALL THIS THE SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE UTILIZING ITS CURRENT TECHNOLOGY IT'S CURRENTLY WORKING- WE'RE LOOKING FOR THINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORING OUT IN THE MARKETPLACE OTHER STATES ARE USING SO WE'RE NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH OR NOT- LOOKING TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE- EXISTING OUR OLDER SYSTEMS RIGHT. WILL BE INTERACTING WITH THEM FOR DATA. OKAY IN WE ARE BEING RELEASED ONE. OKAY SO THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT IS IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IMPLEMENTED ORIGINALLY BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. I DON'T SEE WE GOT A GOOD FAITH EXTENSION THROUGH THE END. I'M SORRY YOUR BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY WE GOT A GOOD FAITH EXTENSION OF BROADEST THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND NOW UNTIL WE GET THIS IMPLEMENTED TO MEET FEDERAL REGULATION THERE ARE PENALTIES AND THEY'LL CONTINUE TO BE UNTIL IT'S IMPLEMENTED. IN SO- NOT TO GET TOO MUCH INTO THE WEEDS YEAH. NEW WINE WE ARE NOW. EIGHTY NINE. I'M I CAN'T HEAR YOU. WHAT'S THE REASON THAT WE ARE ON TIME ENGINEER I THINK IT IS RIGHT- I THINK IT REALLY IS THE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS- THERE WAS A LOT OF ANALYSIS INDIVIDUAL KERR- AND WE'VE BEEN C. T. AND THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO EXPEDITE THIS. TO MINIMIZE THE PENALTIES. I CAN ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE HERE THIS IS MARCO MEETS WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. SO THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DELAYS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN PROVIDING US GUIDANCE AROUND HOW TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS REQUIREMENT. AS A PART OF THAT WAS BAD THE SECOND PART REALLY WAS THE PANDEMIC AND REALLY BEING DELAYED IN TERMS OF- DELIVERY. OUT OF THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THIS REALLY IS THAT IT'S A IT'S A PHASED IN APPROACH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MITIGATE THEIR RISKS SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR- COUNTY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO REALLY BUILD THIS OUT IN A WAY THAT ROLLS IT OUT. IN PHASES THAT WE BUILD OFF OF THE PHASES SO THAT WE LEARN FROM THE PRIOR PHASES BEFORE WE SCALE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. THE PENALTIES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE OUR PENALTIES FROM THE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PURSUANT TO THE STATUTES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS VERY DELAYED IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SPEEDS I DIDN'T SPROUT. HOW IT WOULD ULTIMATELY ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT THIS. PARTICULAR PROVISION OF THE LAW. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO IF THE FOR THIS AND EVERYTHING AND SO CENTER MELINDA'S WILL HAVE TIME TO GET BACK TO THIS AT ANOTHER POINT BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THIS ITEM OPEN. CORRECT WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. OKAY THANK YOU DR AMEN I FOR ISSUE THREE WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA AFFORDABLE DRUG MANUFACTURING ACTING LIKE MEDITATION OR OR SB EIGHT FIVE TWO I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE FOR SHOPPERS JOHNNY ON THE PHONE OR UNDERSTAND MY APOLOGIES AT INTEREST ALL WHO'S AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY AT THE AGENCY WILL TAKE. INCREASING YOU ON THIS RIGHT. A GOOD AFTERNOON SO JUST TO GIVE EVERYONE AN OVERVIEW OF. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WE HAVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PORTABLE DRUG MANUFACTURING ACT OF THE RESOURCES IN THE DCP. FACULTY IF I COULD THAT STOP YOU ONE MINUTE- CAN I SUPPOSE IT BUDGET CHAIR AND I'M GETTING NOTES THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO ASK THE L. A. O. OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE IF THEY'D LIKE TO RAISE THEIR HAND TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS OR IF THEY LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS. SENATOR EIGHT MINUTES- THIS IS TONY PIC FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- THANK YOU SO MUCH I JUST HAD A- VERY BRIEF COMMENTS ABOUT- THE FIRST ITEM- CONCERNING- ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION- WOULD IT BE OKAY TO GO. TO GO BACK TO THAT ISSUE AND JUST MAKE. MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT PLEASE. OKAY SO OUR OFFICE DALY- HAS REVIEWED THE PROPOSAL FOR EDV PHASE TO PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION DOLLARS AND WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BUT WE WANTED TO RAISE ONE POSSIBLE ISSUE- THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT. SO DREAMS IF THE PHASE ONE PART OF- DEVELOPING ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION THE ISSUE OF CAPTURING A SERVICE PROVIDERS LOCATION BY ELECTRONIC MEANS AT THE START AND END OF A SHIFTER THE WORKDAY. ENDED UP CAUSING A DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION IN THE RECENT WISE- ORIGINALLY- THIS FIRST PHASE CONCERNED IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WORKERS AND THEY HAD EXPRESSED SOME PRIVACY CONCERNS WITH. EEVEE V. ELECTRONICALLY CAPTURING THEIR LOCATION. AND CALIFORNIA HAD INITIALLY PLANNED TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM THAT DID NOT. CAPTURED ELECTRONICALLY THE LOCATION. I'M NEVER THE LESS- AND RECEIVED- WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS APPROVAL FROM THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES TO DO THAT. NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS- NATIONWIDE GUIDANCE THAT WAS ISSUED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES THAT WAS SORT OF IN CONFLICT WITH HIS INITIAL PLAN. SO THE REASON I'M- AND SO CALIFORNIA HAS A RECONFIGURE THE SYSTEM- WHICH CAUSED A SLIGHT DELAY AND SO THE REASON I'M RAISING THIS ISSUE IN RESPECT TO PHASE TWO. IS JUST TO AT WORK WERE WONDERING IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ACCOUNTED FOR THIS. SLIGHTLY SENSITIVE ISSUE- REGARDING ELECTRONIC- BETTER CAPTURING OF A SERVICE. PROVIDER'S LOCATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN UP PLEASE. HI ANASTASIA DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES- YES SO WE HAVE HAD IN A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDER MEETING ON BEHALF OF THE FUNDING DEPARTMENT AT THE STATE TO INCLUDING DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES FOR ME HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND OTHERS AND WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS WITH THE COLORS WE KNOW THAT WOULD BE TO WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ON. A LEFT TRYING TO GRIEVE VERIFYING. THE LOCATION AT THE START TIME AND END TIME OF SERVICES NOT THINKING TRACKING BUT FIFTH CAN AND FIND. SO WE HAVE MADE THAT ASSUMPTION IN OUR SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT IN THAT OUR XP. AND SO WE WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE AND AGAIN WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES. SEVEN OTHER STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSION. COMING UP SHORTLY. CHRIS THANK YOU SEND YOUR QUESTIONS ARE. AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. OKAY WE'LL CONTINUE. I BELIEVE THAT ITEM OF. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER. THREE GROUNDHOG DAY YESTERDAY BUT HERE WE GO. SURE SO I JUST TO KIND OF GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL FOR US SENATE BILL. FIVE TO THE CALIFORNIA PORTABLE DRUG MANUFACTURING OCT- THE P. C. P. THAT WE PUT FORTH WHICH GIVES RISE FUTURE TO US THE RESOURCES TO. JANGAN SERVICES AND ONE OF TEACHERS THAT WOULD SERVE IN A PROJECT MANAGEMENT CAPACITY. THE BILL ITSELF. SB TWO CALLS FOR THE AGENCY TO ENTER INTO PARTNERSHIPS TO INCREASE GENERIC MANUFACTURING- IN THIS LEGISLATION ALIGNED WITH AN EARLIER PROPOSAL. ENDS AT THE SCHOOL YEARTWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE STATE TO INCREASE GENERIC MANUFACTURING. AND WHAT THE RESOURCES WILL ALLOW US TO DO AND SOME. ADDRESS VARIOUS RESEARCH AND ANALYTICAL TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL YOU CAN DO IT PROCEED ALONG THREE INTERRELATED TRACKS- THE FIRST TRACK IS FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING TOP DRUGS. THIS WOULD BE A DATA DRIVEN ANALYSIS WHICH LAYERS ON. OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS ON PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ECONOMIC. FOR EXAMPLE PUBLIC HEALTH AFTER WOULD BE DRUGS THAT ADDRESS OUR HIGH RISK OR HIGH MORTALITY CONDITIONS ECONOMIC FACTORS LOOK AT COST- AND THEN THE SECOND TRACK- FOR THE RESOURCES THAT IN THIS PROPOSAL WOULD FOCUS ON LEGAL MARKET POLICY AND REGULATORY FACTORS. SO THIS IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE FEASIBILITY OF WHICH DRUGS TO MANUFACTURE- AND THEN LASTLY THAT THE THIRD TRACK IS FOCUSED ON STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES. THIS IS MORE ABOUT THE HOW OF GETTING DRUGS INTO THE HANDS OF CONSUMERS. SO FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CONTRACT WE LOOK AT DISTRIBUTION MODELS. SUCH AS RETAIL PHARMACIES OR MAIL ORDER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. SERVICES. AND I JUST WANTED POLICY HEARING CASE- THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS AND IS IT IS THE ARE WE PROPOSING- DOES DID THE BILL PROPOSED THAT THE STATE ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURING OR TO CONTRACT WITH THE MANUFACTURER. SO THE WAY THAT THE BILL'S STRUCTURED IS- THERE'S TERM. DEFINED AS PARTNERSHIPS. AND PARTNERSHIPS IS DEFINED BROADLY THIS COULD MEAN- AND GENERIC PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BY WAY OF CONTRACTS WERE PURCHASED THANK THROUGH. YOUR REPAIRS OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES- AND THEN THERE'S A- LEGISLATIVE REPORT THAT'S DUE AND- SHIP IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT'S MORE FOCUSED ON THE STATE ITSELF- DIRECTLY MANUFACTURING DRUGS AND THAT ONCE HE'S ABILITY STUDY. EXAMINING YOUR THAT THE TRADE OFFS OF. AT THE STATE GOING DOWN THAT PATH. SO THAT WOULD BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE CONSULTANTS AND WHAT THEY COME UP WITH AFTER LOOKING AT THE- AT THE ISSUE THE CORRECT YES CORRECT. OKAY ALL RIGHT AND IT DOES IT ALSO CONTEMPLATE THE MANUFACTURING TAKING PLACE IN CALIFORNIA DESPITE IF WE ARE EITHER. CONTRACTING WITH OR DOING IT OURSELVES. THE BILL DOESN'T. HIDE SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY TO MANUFACTURING CALIFORNIA- BUT WE ARE TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WERE KIND OF LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE OF POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIPS. OKAY THANK YOU. AND THEN THE NEXT ITEM- THE NEXT QUESTION PLEASE. YES SIR. TODAY WE DON'T HAVE A CONCRETE TIMELINE FOR WHEN THE FIRST CONTRACTS WOULD BE ENTERED INTO THE BILL RECENTLY CAME INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. CURRENTLY WE'RE JUST USING INTERNAL RESOURCES TO DO INITIAL PLANNING AND STRATEGY. BUT THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WILL BE ON. SHOULD IDENTIFY THE TOP DRUGS WHICH THE RESOURCES IN THE PCP WILL ENABLE AGENCY TO DO. AND ONCE WE GET THAT DATA ON THE TOP DRUGS THAT'S REALLY GOOD AND I DON'T APPLY IT OUR- POTENTIAL PARTNERS TO THIS PROJECT. DOUBLE DOUBLE THE STATE ON THE PATH- SHOULD SELLING THE REQUIREMENTS INVESTIGATE I TO MANUFACTURE. CARE HI GENERIC DRUGS. OKAY MADAM CHAIR WHEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS MMHM THE PROPOSAL OKAY DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE ANSWERED AS RESPOND TO THE THIRD QUESTION AND YOUR RESPONSE TO ME. FOR THE THIRD QUESTION- RESOURCES- IN. IN THE PCP WOULD COMFORT THE THIRD MAN DAY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE REPORT ON A FEASIBILITY OF DRUG MANUFACTURING. OKAY THANK YOU ORIGINAL MELINDA'S. I'M SURE I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO COST JUST BE SEATED WITH. YOU'RE PUTTING A DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIP PLAN TOGETHER THERE'S COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND I'M CURIOUS. WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING TO COME FROM TO FUND THAT- AND THEN I DO HAVE TO GO BACK TO THIS QUESTION- I GUESS I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING- YOUR Y. GERMANIC MEANS ARCH WOULD WANT TO GO INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. I THINK IT'S- MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY. YOU KNOW AND PRIVATE MARKETPLACE RENDON CARTON WITH THE STATE MUST YEARS. THIS HOSTAGE GREEN I'M NOT AWARE OF INSTRUCTIONS SHE. SO ON. THERE ARE SOME INCENTIVES FOR YOU KNOW DRAMATIC ACTRESS TO WORK WITH THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE LARGE VOLUME THAT'S A CITY CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS- YOU KNOW THERE'S CALPERS DH CS- ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA AND THEN THERE'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES SOME STATES ARE COUNTER COSTS BUT ALSO KIND OF DEPENDING ON WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE THERE CAN AND THE VOLUME THAT IT REPRESENTS OUR COULD BE OPPORTUNITIES US FROM A STATE PURCHASER PERSPECTIVES. AND THEN- ANY ON THE KIND OF THE DEALS AT THE STATE CAPS. THIS COULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE. ON AS OTHER ENTITIES KIND OF BEING. GATHERED ON TO THAT THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY YEAH. AND THEN- REGARDING YOUR EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT ON. THE COSTS FOR DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS- WE ARE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE EXISTING MODEL WHERE. THERE IS- PHARMACIES RETAIL PHARMACIES SO- WE ARE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ACOSTA TACTIC MASS AND BEING ABLE TO. THANK THREE VAST AND- ALSO KIND OF ALSO THINKING OF OTHER CHANNELS SUCH AS MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES THAT ARE MORE DIRECT TO CONSUMER. THAT OUT INCREASING UTILIZATION SINCE THE PANDEMIC SO- WE WILL. BE WHAT I WANTED TO RAISE COSTS BY MANUFACTURER TRUCK WE WOULD. TAKE A KIND OF AN ON APPROACH ON- BENEFACTOR OF THE DRUG AND ALSO GETTING INTO THE HANDS OF THE CONSUMER. I TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE TYPES OF FACTORS. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE THEM WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ALSO LOOK THROUGH AN EQUITY LENS A LOT OF OUR SMART SMALLER PHARMACIES IN OUR IN OUR- COMMUNITIES ARE ARE THOSE THAT ARE REALLY ON THE GROUND WITH OUR- COMMUNITIES WHO ARE MOST AT RISK. WHO MAY NOT AVAILABLE SELVES TO A MAILING. SO LET'S JUST MAKE SURE WE KEEP THAT IN MIND AS A PROGRAM DEVELOPED. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY ANY COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENT FINANCE OR THE ELIA. OKAY WELL WE'LL LEAVE THAT ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. FOR DR AMEN SO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR IS THE CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION MY COLLEAGUE JOHN ARMENIAN IT'S GONNA TAKE LEAD IN BRIEFING ON THAT PARTICULAR ITEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON I HAD THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ESTABLISHES THE CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION WITHIN THIS- CGHS. THE BILL INTEGRATES THE FOLLOWING ENTITIES THE OFFICE OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND INTEGRITY. THE OFFICE OF THE PATIENT ADVOCATE THE OFFICE OF INNOVATION AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS THE LANGUAGE AUTHORIZES THE CENTER TO KEEP CERTAIN FUNCTIONS FROM THESE ENTITIES SUCH AS THE ANNUAL REPORT CARD ON QUALITY CARE AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE. LIKE HEALTH COVERAGE PROGRAMS AND GUIDANCE ON HEALTH DATA SHARING AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH INFORMATION PRIVACY LAWS AND REVIEW THESE RESEARCH PROPOSALS USING STATE DATA ASSETS. IN ADDITION THE LANGUAGE AUTHORIZES THE CENTER TO DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER- A RESEARCH DATA HUB- ADMINISTERED THE C. H. H. AS OPEN DATA PORTAL ENGAGE AND COORDINATE WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH COVERAGE PROGRAMS. TO HELP ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH EXPAND HEALTH DATA SHARING AND HEALTH INFORMATION PRIVACY COMPLIANCE GUIDANCE AMONG STATE ENTITIES. AND DEFINITELY WORK ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF. IMPROVING DATA SHARING- AND DATA PROCESSES AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE CGHS DEPARTMENTS. I'LL STOP THERE AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. I'M AT THIS TIME. MOVE ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION PLEASE. I THINK HE LAST PIECE THAT THERE WERE THREE QUESTIONS SUBMITTED- THE LANGUAGE ALSO PERMITS FOR THE CENTER TO COLLECT FEES FROM STATE DEPARTMENTS FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO SEE COSTS FROM RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS- FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS. THE LANGUAGE ALLOWS STATE ASSETS TO BE DISCLOSED TO ALL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND NONPROFIT HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES WHICH WILL BENEFIT THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS THE LANGUAGE AUTHORIZES THE CENTER TO ADOPT REGULATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THESE FUNCTIONS. ALL RIGHT. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR L. A. O. OR DEPARTMENT FINANCE. ANY OF THE SENATORS. ALL RIGHT WELL WE WILL LEAVE THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE. OKAY. HI DOCTOR AYMAN THIS IS MARCO BEACH AGAIN AND I WILL PRESENT ON ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS THE EQUITY CENTER PROGRAMS PROPOSAL AT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL JUST TO GIVE YOU A QUICK OVERVIEW IS CONSISTED OF FORTY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND I'LL BRIEFLY WALK YOU THROUGH EACH ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS AND THEN CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS FROM ONE OF OUR ONE IS REALLY FOCUSED ON- COLDER CLOSE PROBABLY NINETEEN EQUITY ANALYSIS. AT THIS IS ALL CENTERED AROUND THE NOTION THAT FOR MANY YEARS THAT'S AS MANY OF US WORKING TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR SEATS AS OUT WE ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE INEQUITIES ARE THE DISPARITIES AS WE SEE AND- IN IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THOSE INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES POOREST SIGNIFICANTLY EXACERBATED BY THE COLD THE NINETEENTH AND I MIGHT ANSWER THE PREMISE BEHIND THIS PARTICULAR ANALYSIS IS REALLY WORKING WITH RESEARCH PARTNERS CAN BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW DEEP THOSE INEQUITIES AS A RESULT OF THE COOKING NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND WE'RE REALLY WORKING WITH OUR STATE COLLEAGUES LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES THAT BETTER THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT AS PART OF OUR RECOVERY AND WE'RE DISRUPTING THOSE INEQUITIES. AND BUILDING BACK BETTER. THE SECOND COMPOUND OF THIS. IS A LINE ACCESS POLICY FRAMEWORK. AND THE PROMISED REALLY IS TO ON OF WHERE THAT HAS DONE BY THE LARGEST. AND MINISTER AND THE SERIES PROGRAMS ACROSS OR AGENCY AROUND LANGUAGE ACCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT WE'RE DELIVERING HAVE. A SET STANDARD IN TERMS OF WHAT LANGUAGES. WE'D TRANSLATE MATERIAL IN THAT THE INFORMATION HAS MOST OF ALL. PART THREE OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS BUILDING AT EQUITY DASHBOARD ACROSS OUR MAJOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. AND THE IDEA HERE REALLY IS TO. REALLY ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE DATA. AROUND EQUIT WITH-REGARDS TO THE PROGRAMS IN SOME INSTANCES WE MAY HAVE THE DATA IN OTHER INSTANCES WE MAY NOT HAVE THE DATA. AND SO PART OF THE PREMISE IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE ENGAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD BEGIN COLLECTING DATA. CERTAINLY IT ALLOWS US TO REALLY WORK WITH THE PUBLIC OR STAKEHOLDERS COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE COUNTIES. AS WELL AS YOU THE LEGISLATURE AROUND. AREAS WHERE WE DO HAVE INEQUITIES IN HOW WE TO CLOSE IN EQUITIES ARE. AND ALL FINALLY CLOSE WITH THE FOURTH PIECE OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WHICH IS TO EXPAND. WORK FORCE TRAINING FOR STATE EMPLOYEES AROUND RACE. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE BUILDING COLLECTIVELY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. AT THAT THEY ARE ROOTED IN RACIAL JUSTICE AND- YEAH IMMEDIATE ANY INDIVIDUAL I. ALSO DOCTOR EGGMAN I WILL PAUSE HERE TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION AND I'M HAPPY TO GO THROUGH THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR GENDER IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU OKAY OF JUST TWO QUESTIONS I HAD WITH THE EQUITY DASHBOARD SO. WELL WE'VE BEEN OUT OF SESSION LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE I GO TO THE STATE DASHBOARD THE PUBLIC HEALTH THAT DASHBOARD MY COUNTY DASHBOARD WILL THIS NEW EQUITY DASHBOARD BE JUST OFF ON ONE OF OUR ALREADY EXISTING DASHBOARDS WILL BE A NEW DASHBOARD AND WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE PUT INTO THE DASHBOARD AND WEBER. WHERE DO WE GET THAT INFORMATION FROM. GREAT QUESTION SENATOR SIR RIGHT NOW WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL AN OPEN DATA PORTAL ON OUR WEBSITE AT C. HHS DOT CA DOT COM. AS PART OF THE OPEN DATA PORTAL WE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY HAVE A PROGRAM'S DASHBOARD AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO ON THE PROGRAM'S DASHBOARD AND BY. I BELIEVE DISTRICT FOR SENATE DISTRICT I COUNTY LOOK AT. UTILIZATION OF SERVICES ACROSS OUR MAJOR PROGRAMS AT THE MOMENT. AND SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE REALLY IS TO BUILD OFF OF A CONCEPT LIKE THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO GET DIG DEEPER INTO THAT. MEASURES ARE REALLY FOCUSED AROUND EQUITY- I THINK RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE. THAT ANSWER FOR YOU AND IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE MEASURES EXACTLY WHAT HE- PROMISED YOUR WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD CONVENE SIR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS TO REALLY HELP US UNDERSTAND. AND DIG DEEP INTO THE DATA THAT WE HAVE TO IN ORDER FOR US TO FOCUS MEASURES THAT. PROMOTE THAT PASSPORT. IT SO WHO'S THE AUDIENCE FOR THE DASHBOARD IS A PROVIDERS OR IS IT. CONSUMERS OF SERVICES. I DON'T THINK THAT THIS ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE IT'S REALLY CONSUMER DRIVEN- I THINK IT THIS IS REALLY FOR US COLLECTIVELY AFRO GRAHAM. WELL FOLKS PROGRAM LEVEL AT. RISK LIKE YOURSELF YOU'RE REALLY BE ABLE TO SHINE A LIGHT ON WHERE DO WE SEE THE INEQUITIES AND THEN WORK WITH OUR POLICYMAKERS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE GAPS. ADMINISTRATOR OR LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BUY DOWN THOSE GAPS INTENT REALLY IS NOT THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S GETTING SERVICES INTENT REALLY IS US COLLECTIVELY AS A COMMUNITY. AND THAT COULD BE DIFFERENT LEVELS IT COULD BE AN INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM LIKE AN MSSP PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE OR AND I JUST THIS PROGRAM BACK ON THE LEVEL. IT CERTAINLY CAN BE- A STATE DEPARTMENT LOOKING AT ITS IT'S- PROGRAM AND THEN YOU AS THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU CONTEMPLATE WORKING ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT POLICY PIECES. AND OUT WHERE THE GAPS. ARE WITH REGARDS TO EQUITIES. AND ON WORKFORCE AS YOU WILL ALLUDED THE MOST THE- ARE DELIVERED BY COUNTY STAND OR ARE A NONPROFIT PARTNERS WHO WHO IS WHO GETS THIS TRAINING MONEY ISN'T THROUGH A GRANT FOR. LOCALS OR IS IT FOR STATE TRAINING. EXCELLENT QUESTION DOCTOR A MAN SO WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF VARIOUS TRAININGS FOR OUR- BUCKETS OF TRAINING DOLLARS FOR- OUR AND OUR COUNTY. THE PROGRAM THE TYPE OF THIS PURPOSE PROPOSES REALLY FOCUSED ON THE STATE WORKFORCE AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE STATE WORKFORCE OUR ACCESS TO TRAININGS ARE FOCUSED REALLY ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC THIS IS HARD HONES IN SPECIFICALLY ON THE STATE WORKFORCE. OKAY THANK YOU ANY ANY QUESTIONS CENTER MELINDA'S BEFORE WE HAVEN'T RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE PROVIDED. DO YOU THINK YOU- OKAY SO. HEALTH CARE INEQUITIES CERTAINLY ARE REAL ENOUGH QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT- I'M I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IS GOING TO HELP- THE HEALTH INEQUITIES THAT EXIST IN MY DISTRICT IN THE EASTERN PART OF MY DISTRICT CERTAINLY- HAS SOME ISSUES AND- WHAT I NOTICED GOES ON OFTEN TIMES IS THAT THE MORE URBAN AND- COASTAL COMMUNITIES SEEM TO GET MORE ATTENTION ONE RESOURCES ASSISTANCE TO. PLACES INLAND TYPES OF CITIES OR THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF MY DISTRICT SO WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE CONSUMERS AS IT IS MORE OR THE- GOVERNMENTAL SIDE AND I WOULD JUST. EVEN THAT POSITION YOU KNOW WE HAVE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AN ADDITIONAL MONEY I'M- CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS GOING TO BENEFIT. PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT. ABSOLUTELY CENTER I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. THERE'S TWO RESPONSES TO THAT QUESTION THE FIRST RESPONSE REALLY IS AROUND CHANGING SYSTEMS AT THE POLICY LEVEL. OUT WE CAN DO A LOT BACK TO DISRUPT INEQUITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITHIN PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED. BUT THE PREMISE BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL REALLY IS LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE ACROSS THE AGENCY FIVE AND A TWELVE DEPARTMENTS AND FIVE OFFICES. AWAITING THE DATA AND DEVELOPING POLICIES IN ORDER FOR US TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL I. THINK THAT ONCE WE BEGIN TO pCOMPONENTS. ALTERNATELY HAS PROFOUND IMPACTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE IF WE CAN CHANGE THE SYSTEM. I ANY AND WHAT IN WAYS IN WHICH WE ADMINISTER PROGRAMS THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT WE PUT FORWARD. THOSE ALL WILL HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON EITHER THE CONSUMER. WHO HE OR SHE MIGHT BE GETTING SERVICES DIRECTLY OR THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT IT TOO FULL IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT INEQUITIES IN WHAT WE CAN DO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL AND HOW WE. ADDRESS THAT AT THE- LOCAL. OKAY THANK YOU. YOU CAN START RESPONDING TO THE QUESTIONS. DR EGGMAN'S ALSO WITH QUESTION NUMBER TWO AROUND WITH THE- EQUITY ANALYSIS ALSO INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS. WITH REGARDS TO ACTIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN I THINK OUR INTENTION HERE REALLY IS TO WORK FIRST OUT WITH THEIR RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TO HELP US DEVELOP THE ANALYSIS. AND THEN COLLECTIVELY TAKE THAT ANALYSIS OF WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO THINK THROUGH WHAT ARE THE PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE COLLECTIVELY AND I'LL GO INTO SO WHAT I WILL SAY HERE IS THAT THAT THAT BE ANALYSIS ITSELF FOR THE ENTITY THAT WOULD BE DOING THE LICENSE WOULD NOT BE MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION. THE INTENT IS THAT WE TAKE THAT AND THEN WORK WITH A BROADER STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY THINK ABOUT WHAT THE RECOMMENDATION. PRESCOTT ON. THE THIRD QUESTION. YOU HAVE IN YOUR A GENUINE IS RELATED TO THE LANGUAGE ACCESS POLICY FRAMEWORK- AND- ITS ABILITY TO APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OR HEALTH INFORMATION. THE INTENT REALLY BEHIND THE LANGUAGE ACCESS IS THAT STATE RUN PROGRAMS AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE BOTH ON THE HOUSE SIDE AND THE HUMAN SERVICES SIDE. HOW ABOUT BASED STANDARD OUT SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS HAVE MUCH HIGHER STANDARDS IN TERMS THRESHOLD LANGUAGES- AND REQUIREMENTS BOTH FROM LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE IS REALLY CREATE A SPOT THAT UNIFORM STANDARD ACROSS OUR ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER. IN A NATURAL IT COULD POTENTIALLY TRANSLATE INTO A BETTER INFORMATION AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL. BUT THE INTENT REALLY ISN'T THIS BE HIGHER LEVEL WITH REGARDS TO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE MISTER WITHIN. ARE THERE THE AGENCY IN TERMS OF NEXT STEPS HERE WHICH IS THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION. WE HAVE ALREADY FORMULATED A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS ACROSS OR AGENCY WHO ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ACROSS. A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAM AREAS. OUT THAT STANDARD LOOK LIKE IN THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THIS IS THE KNOW WHAT YOU OF OUR DATA. BEIJING GUIDELINES SO WE HAVE ARE WE HAVE BASIC STANDARDS THE AGENTS. AND THEN DEPARTMENTS CHOOSE GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT I SHOULD THEY WANT. BE INTENT HERE IS TO ENSURE POLICY ALL THE PART IN EACH YEAH I IS OUR EACH UP BY. AND THEN THEY START CAN GO BONTA TO PERSON ORDER ME BUT WE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S BASIC AT LEVEL ACROSS. AGENCY. FOREST ARE. QUESTION YOU HAVE IS RELATED TO THE EQUITY GAS SPORTS IN THE CURRENT GAPS IN THE COLLECTION OF CERTAIN DEMOCRATS FOR A QUIRKY INFORMATION AND HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS THAT PREVENT. IDENTIFICATION OF INEQUITIES AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I THINK IS THE PROMISE OF WHY WE WANT TO DO THIS. SO IT'S NOT ONLY TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT DID I DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE THAT HELPS US BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INEQUITIES. IT'S ALSO A TO SAY WHAT DATA DON'T WE HAVE BUT WE WANT TO HAVE IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND SO PART OF THE THAT THE EXERCISE HERE IS DIGGING DEEPER IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE PACKAGE THE DATA THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE TO HELP AND- OUR WORK. AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN FURTHER BUILD ON THAT BY ADDING DATA ELEMENTS INTO OUR WORK MOVING FORWARD. IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE SOME VISIBILITY THAT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT HERE THAT ARE WEEK IMPROVES AT THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS SEES AND WORK WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AND PROVIDER GROUPS. I TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEING COLLECTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. HAS I LOVE OF QUALITY BECAUSE- AS MANY OF KNOW. THE PALMER OF THAT IS AS GOOD AS IT'S PART SO. WORK WITH LOCAL. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COLLECT. THE SECOND PART OF THIS IS RELATED TO OUR THE MINISTRY PLAN IF YOU WOULD JUST ROLL OUR WORK AROUND TO MAKE CARE AT THE MINUTE CARE PRICE ESTIMATE HEALTHCARE. PROJECTS I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS NOT JUST HEALTH RELATED% IS HUMAN SERVICES RELATED WE GOTTA THINK ABOUT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T PER SE RIGHT NOW SUGGEST ANY CHANGES TO ANY ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS BUT THAT CERTAINLY COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE COME FORWARD. ON ONCE WE IDENTIFY OR OR REALLY DIG DEEP INTO IT OUT WHAT DATA WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND SO WHEN I WAS VERY TO THAT QUESTION IS THAT THE PREMISE HERE REALLY IS THAT. WE ARE NOT FUNDING WITH THESE DOLLARS SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW BUT WE ARE FUNDING REALLY IS BARBARA JEAN- EXISTING DATA TO BUILD THE PAST. AND THEN REALLY WORKING WITH YOU ASK FOR FUTURE OF MEDICATIONS AROUND SISTER JEAN JUST MIGHT BE NEEDED RELATED SCREW I'VE DIVISIONAL DATA THAT WE. MIGHT NEED TO PROCURE. QUESTION NUMBER FIVE IS A SURPRISE THE CORRECT. OF THE WORK FORCE TRAIN OR- AND REYES EQUITY OUT AND- THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS EXIST. LIKE YOUR PROGRAM ITS THAT SB APART USE. I WHAT WE CAN. HAPPENING IS US WORKING WITH ALL TO ALL DEPARTMENTS AND FIND OFFICES. UNDERSTAND THE PROS AND CONS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXIST AND THEN THINK ABOUT THEIR CURRICULAR DAD IS GOING TO FIT. THE NEEDS OF OUR DEPARTMENTS COLLECTIVELY I JUST WILL EMPHASIZE HERE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE AUDIENCE. WHO WERE TRYING TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THIS TRAINING IS AVAILABLE FOR AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE REALLY MAKING SURE THAT MY LOCAL STAFF ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS TRAINING IN ORDER. TO BE ABLE TO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. A RATIO AYE ACT WHICH- INDIVIDUAL BIAS THAT'S- I PROMISE YOU'RE WITH TO. OUT WE DON'T A PARTICULAR. AT IT DOWN RIGHT NOW I DON'T REALLY LOOK WEBER WITH. AS WELL AS- OUR INTERNAL. THINK ABOUT WHICH PROGRAM MIGHT BE. IT NEEDS IS BOND. THE WAY THAT WERE TO ACCOMPLISH IF FINALLY I YOUR LAST QUESTION HOW DOES THE- PLAN TO. EFFORTS BUT POP EQUITY NATIONAL RECENTLY ANNOUNCED BY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. WE CERTAINLY ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PINE HARRISON DISTRIBUTION. AND THE WORK THAT HAPPENED IN THE TRANSITION PARTICULARLY AROUND KOBE AND THE STROKE EMPHASIS ON EQUITY OBVIOUSLY THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BECOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TOPICS RELATED TO COMPANY NINETEEN. AND THIS CERTAINLY WILL BE ONE OF THOSE PIECES I DON'T HAVE A CONCRETE ANSWER FOR YOU IN TERMS OF WHAT SPECIFICS WHAT WE DO HERE TOGETHER I THINK THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT ON BOTH ENDS TO REALLY WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LEVERAGE EACH OTHER'S WORK. AND ACCELERATE SOME OF IT MOVING FORWARD. OUR DOCTOR EGGMAN I WILL HERE IN SEE IF YOU ARE OR CENTER. MELENDEZ HAVE ANY FUN UP QUESTIONS TO ASK OF THOSE ANSWERS. I DO NOT. OKAY ANY COMMON OR QUESTIONS FROM THE OF FINE CERTAINLY. OKAY THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. GREAT DR AMEN I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE STEPHANIE IS WELL SPOKEN BECAUSE HE WILL TAKE LEAD AND AB RESPONDING TO THIS PARTICULAR ITEM TO BRIEF YOU ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME STEPHANIE. IS WELSH THANK YOUNG THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN AND DATA CENTER EVELYN DOES IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO TALK ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. AND I DID THE SECRETARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT I GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP WITH THIS BECAUSE- OF THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AND AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. SO I'LL BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SETTING UP OUR OFFICE IN HOUSTON COMMUNITY RESTORATION AND THE POSITIONS THAT WE ARE REQUESTING AS WELL AS ONGOING BUDGET COST. SO SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE WHICH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNS REPEAL PROVISIONS THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED THE DEPARTMENT AT HOUSTON COMMUNITY RESTORATION. AND THE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD HAVE TRANSFERRED THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF. DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. ALBANY ALBANY SERVICES AGING. STASHED ALSO A ESTABLISHED THE OFFICE OF YOU THINK REST. WITHIN OUR AGENCY AFFECTED JULY ONE TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT IS SUPPORT THE TRANSITION AND THE PURPOSE OF THE OFFICES IS TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH TO BE SERVED IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES CONSISTENT WITH OVER A DECADE OF REFORMS TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ESTABLISHED IN THE OFFICE AT THE AGENCY FEDERAL LINES WITH RESEARCH AND BEST PRACTICES THAT FOCUS ON REHABILITATION AND SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF TRAUMA INFORMED AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. RESEARCH SUPPORTS THAT KIDS BEING CLOSER TO HOME IS MORE LIKELY TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. FOR THESE REASONS HOUSING THE OFFICE WITHIN AGENCY WILL BE A FACTOR THE SCOPE OF OUR DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN OFFICE JUST LIKE THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL CAN SUPPORT THE NEW OFFICE IN ITS EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES TO SUPPORT CONNECTIONS. TO LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS WHO ARE GOING TO SERVE THESE UNITS IN ADDITION TO PROBATION INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE DEPARTMENT. TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE TREND. THE LEGISLATION. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SUBCOMMITTEE AT THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL TO ADVISE AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE OFFICE RELATED TO THE POLICIES -GRAMS APPROACHES THAT. IMPROVE YOU THE OUTCOMES REDUCE YOUTH DETENTION AND OF COURSE REDUCE RECIDIVISM- THE- OFFICE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR STAFFING THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. THE STATUTE CLEARLY OUTLINES THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICE THESE INCLUDED PROMOTING TRAUMA RESPONSIVE CULTURALLY INFORMED SERVICES. IDENTIFYING AND DISSEMINATING BEST PRACTICES. ASSESSING THE AFFECT THE EFFICACY OF LOCAL PROGRAMS. REVIEWING LOCAL JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT GRANTS TO ENSURE THEY CONTAINS ALL NECESSARY ELEMENTS AND IT'S NOT THE OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT PLAN IMPROVEMENTS. AND TO DEVELOP POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND INTEGRATE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU. THE OFFICE ALSO- WILL STAND OUT AND I SERVICE AN OMBUDSPERSON SERVICE THAT WILL BE MANNED BY SEVERAL STAFF. IN ORDER TO. RECEIVE REVIEW AND ASSESS- ISSUES AND COMPLAINTS. THAT COME FROM THE COMMUNITY- THAT IS A BROAD OVERVIEW ALL VERY SEE IF THEY ARE ANY. QUESTIONS BEFORE I AM. FANS OF THE QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE BY THE CAN. ARE YOU EXCITED TO GET THIS GOING. I AM. I AM I THAT I KNOW THAT YOU AND I HAVE A BRIEF OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS IT AND- I COULDN'T THINK OF A BETTER PLACE AT THE HOUSE THIS AND TO REALLY LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE OF OUR VARIOUS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS- TO FIND CREATIVE AND EFFECTIVE WAYS TO SERVE EASIEST LOCALLY- I THINK YEAH IT'S- A VERY EXCITED. OKAY I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THURMOND IS IT. ON THE OVERVIEW BEFORE SHE GETS IN THE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS- I WILL ASK THE QUESTION UNLESS YOU'RE PLANNING ON A DIRECTION- AND DRESSING QUESTION. REPRINTING OR INTERESTING- WHICH I THINK. I THINK HE'S GOING TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS THAT WE SKED AFTER THE OVER YOU JUST WONDER IF THERE WAS ANY QUESTIONS. BASED ON THE OVERVIEW. YOU'RE IN SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN QUESTIONS NO I WILL GO TO. OKAY WELL LET'S LAUNCH INTO THE QUESTIONS THEN SO THE FIRST QUESTION- TALKS ABOUT WHAT DUTIES ARE STAFF WILL BE. PROVIDING BUT OVER THE COURSE OF TIME AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS ARE REALLY KIND OF WANT TO WALK THROUGH THE STATUTE HAS THREE DIFFERENT TO- POTS OF RESOURCES. AND IT'S IT IS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING- BUT THE OFFICE ITSELF REALLY HAS. TO RESPONSIBILITIES IT STARTS WITH THE FIRST ROUND OF JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT GRANT PLANTS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE FILED WITH THIS OFFICE BY JANUARY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND SO THEREFORE THAT OUR UNIT ACCOUNTING LIAISONS AND IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR POLICY UNIT WILL BE BUSY REVIEWING THESE PLAN ELEMENTS. AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO RETURN THOSE PLAN ELEMENTS FOR COUNTY REVISIONS OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACCEPT RESTED THIS THIS WORK WILL ALL HAPPEN. WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE OFFICE STANDING UP- AND THIS IS AN ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY- THE UNIT STAFF THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO AS COUNTY LIAISONS WILL BE WORKING ON WITH THE COUNTY IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THIS TIME. IDENTIFYING TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS IN PARTICULAR- AND OFFERING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- THEN THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT AND- IT IS TRUE. THAT THE STATUTE AS WRITTEN PROVIDES THAT BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. MODEL JUVENILE JUSTICE GRANT ADMINISTRATION THAT CURRENTLY. ARE IS BEING- OVERSEE AT THE BOY OF STATE COMMITTEE. WILL TO THE TWO OFFICE. AND IT'S A BILL THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND AT THAT TIME- DO YOU KIND OF HAVE A LIST OF THE FIRST BIG PLAN THAT WILL COME IN UNDER THE JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT GRANT PROGRAM. WILL HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND COUNTIES WILL BE PROVIDING ANNUAL UPDATES THEY MAY PROVIDE A MUCH LARGER UPDATE ON ITS THREE YEAR CYCLE BUT- THE LONG THE SHORT OF IT IS THAT BAD STAFF WILL NOT HAVE TO DO SO MUCH WORK TO REALLY- REVIEW. JUVENILE JUSTICE PLANS BUT THEY WILL BE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS OF THAT TIME BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND THEN. ALSO THERE IS A GRANT THAT'S REALLY ACTUALLY UNDER WAY ALREADY B. I. C. C. IS DOING SOME OF THIS WORK NOW AND THAT'S A ONE TIME GRANT AND THAT'S REALLY SOME RESOURCES FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO DEVELOP INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN BE PREPARED TO ANSWER THESE FOLKS LOCALLY- AND SO THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DETERMINE OUR STAFFING LEVELS- AND- I THINK- WE FELT IT WAS REALLY AFFECTED TO DIVIDE THE OFFICE INTO TWO UNITS THAT WERE LED BY. AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY COORDINATION UNIT WHICH I KIND OF SPOKEN ABOUT QUITE A BIT WHICH- I SIX LIAISONS THAT CAN WORK WITH THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO REVIEW THEIR- REALIGNMENT BROUGHT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAMS. AND THEY ALSO THE KIND OF PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THEN WE HAVE A POLICY RESEARCH OPERATIONS UNIT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. THE OFFICE HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO BEST PRACTICES- AND ALSO- SUBMITTING REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE IN ANALYZING THE ADVOCACY PROGRAMS. AND SO THIS IS REALLY WHAT THIS YOUNG UNIT WOULD. BE FOCUSED ON- AND THAT IS ALL THE AREA OF OUR OFFICE THAT WOULD. INCLUDE AND JUST BILL- DUTIES- AND THEN LAST-WHICH THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WINX SOME. CON FUNDS BECAUSE WE FELT LIKE WE WOULD NEED TO ACQUIRE SOME NECESSARY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN THE AREA OF TRAINING OR JUST FEET. EVOLVING SCIENCE SCIENCE OF ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT THINGS THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE- YOU KNOW CLOSELY AT HAND AND IT GIVES US SOME FLEXIBILITY TO BE NIMBLE AND ADDRESS COUNTY ISSUES- SO. THE NEXT QUESTION- DOES AGENTS EXPECT TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE FTURE AND FUTURE BUDGET YEARS TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- WE DO NOT AT ALL AND WHEN WE DID OUR STAFFING ANALYSIS WE KNEW THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF POTENTIALLY SOME ADDITIONAL. RESPONSIBILITIES AND FULLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY WITHIN OUR EXISTING I REQUEST HERE AND TO MEET THOSE PARTICULAR. RESPONSIBILITIES. AB I THINK THIS IS THE SECOND TO LAST ONE PLEASE PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICE IN REGARDS TO JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT BLOCK GRANTS. IS THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE COUNTY PLAN TIED TO FUNDING- THE STATUTE IS VERY CLEAR ON THIS- BEGINNING IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I COUNTIES MUST FILE A PLAN WITH THE OFFICE- AND THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENTS TO THAT PLAN THEY RANGE FROM ALL OF THE SPECIFICS AROUND THE TARGET POPULATION THE FACILITIES THAT WILL BE USED THE PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE IS AND THE PROVIDERS THAT WILL BE. DELIVERING SERVICES- THEY ALSO MOST DOCUMENTS HOW THEY'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. IN EVERY AREA FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO RE ENTRY SERVICES. AND FAMILY REUNIFICATION. I AM- AND THE PLAN ALSO NEED OUTLINE WHAT DATE THEY WILL BE. ON YOU SERVED HOW THOSE KIND WILL BE MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE RESULTS OF PROGRAM'S INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTED BY THE BLOCK GRANTS. SO WE WILLBE ASSESSING ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS AND COMPONENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE. IN THE PLAINS- WE ALSO REALLY RECOGNIZED THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET THESE RESOURCES OUT TO COMMUNITIES AND TO SUPPORT OURLOCAL IMPLEMENTERS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SERVING NEEDS YOU. AND SO IT'S REALLY PARAMOUNT THAT WE WORK TO GET THESE PLANS APPROVED AND AT THAT SUPPORT THE COUNTIES TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED- HE WILL THAT SERVE THESE THESE YOU. AND THEN LAST. TO WHAT YOU WANT. AND YOUR TEAM WILL BE PERSON BURKE COMPLY- IN THE YOU KNOW- AS ORGAN OR CHART WHICH I THINK YOU HAVE IN YOUR AGENDA WE HAVE BROAD AND- SEVEN X. INTO OUR OFFICE TO HELP ASSIST ARE- PERSON. I DON'T IF YOU SAME PERSON BUT IT'S SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO WILL BE WORKING ON THIS- THEY WILL RECEIVE RUBIO AND RESOLVED AND REFER COMPLAINTS- FROM YOUTH FAMILY STAFF AND OTHERS ABOUT- ANY KIND OF CONDITIONS VIBRATIONS. OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE PRESENTING AN EMERGENCY SITUATION AND THE OFFICE MAY DETERMINE THAT IT CAN RESULT THE COMPLAINTS- DIRECTLY I THINK WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT THAT IS- THAT'S THE NORM WE HAVE. STAFF ON HAND THEY CAN DETECT SINCE. AND WE CAN WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE FACILITY ADMINISTRATORS TO TRY TO RESOLVE ANY ISSUES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT PART OF OUR TA AGENDA TO USE THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THOSE COMPLAINTS TO DELIVER BETTER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE STEP THERE CERTAINLY MAY BE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH COMPLAINTS NEED TO BE REFERRED WE HAVE AN ATTORNEY- WITHIN THE OFFICE THAT CAN HELP ASSIST. WITH GUIDING US ON WHAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE REFERRAL- I THINK THAT IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE DIFFERENT BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH IN THE OFFICE AND TO GET BACK ITEMS- THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS JUST REAL QUICKLY IS THAT THE OFFICE IS REQUIRED. TO PROVIDE REGULAR REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT A VARIETY OF THINGS BUT IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED AND. THE FINDINGS AND ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN. SO WITH THAT I BELIEVE I AM ALL THE QUESTIONS AND- WANT TO OPEN UP AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE AREN'T ANY MORE QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT IN THAT AND WE WANT TO WELCOME A DOCTOR PANELIST WHO'S JOINED US LIVE IN THE HEARING ROOM- AND WHEN HE WAS COMING AND I MAY HAVE MISSED IT BUT I KNOW SOMETIMES WE SET UP. OVERSIGHTSIT AND AS WE KNOW ALL COUNTIES ARE NOT. CREATED EQUAL OR HAVE THE SAME AMOUNTOF RESOURCES OR ABILITY. THE PLAN TO WHILE WE'RE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THEN BRINGING IN DATA. WITH THE REALIGNMENT. WILL WE ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO IF COUNTIES ARE NOT PERFORMING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PERFORMING TO WITHHOLD FUNDING OR OR- WELL THIS WILL IS ACTUALLY HAVE TEETH. WELL I BELIEVE THAT- WE WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE- ISSUES CERTAINLY IF THERE ARE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS VIOLATIONS OF LAW AND THAT WE HAVE PLACES THAT WE CAN GO THERE OBVIOUSLY ARE ENTITIES THAT REGULATE THESE FACILITIES- AND SO I BELIEVE YOU KNOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT- THIS IS. THESE ARE SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE PROVIDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SUPPORT THE COUNTIES TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE IN THIS AND THAT REQUIRES THE RESOURCES- AND DAD. THAT'S MY ANSWER TO THAT. OKAY SO NOT QUITE WE DON'T QUITE HAVE HAVE TEETH BUT BUT WE HOPE THE COUNTIES WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES SO OUR YOUTH AND FAMILIES. CAN BE THEIR MOST SUCCESSFUL AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK TO LOOK FOR WAYS. TO HELP COUNTIES AND CONSTITUENTS BE SUCCESSFUL BUT WHAT I UNDERSTAND. YES AND OF COURSE WE WILL BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE I THINK THREE DIFFERENT REPORTS THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE- AND- AGAIN IF THERE ARE VIOLATIONS OF LAW- CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PRESENTED AN EMERGENCY OF COURSE. OUR OFFICE WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT. OKAY BECAUSE WE ARE WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE- USE IN RESIDENTIAL KIND OF SERVICES CORRECT IT'S A BROAD SPECTRUM. THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NEEDS AND THEY ALSO WORK FOR THE MOST PART HAVE COMMITTED MORE SERIOUS FELONIES. AND SO THESE ARE LIKELY PEOPLE WHO WILL BE HOUSED IN FACILITIES- FOR AT LEAST PORTIONS OF THE OF THAT TIME IN WHICH THEY ARE REHABILITATING. AND SO AS I I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE THE SCOPE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FACILITIES CERTAINLY MANY OF THEM WILL BE OBVIOUSLY. RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS IN THE COMMUNITY. A QUESTION AND I AM I AM I HOPE WOULD JUST BE THAT. AGAIN BEST PRACTICES WOULD SAY THAT WHATEVER FACILITY UP TO YOU THIS IN. THE END THE INTEGRATION BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY HAS TO START SOONER THAN LATER AND THAT'S BEEN ONE OF I THINK OUR STUMBLES ON OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE STOOD UP THAT PEOPLE COME OUT AND THEN THEY ARE JUST KIND OF. SWEPT AWAY WITHOUT ANYTHING OR THE MORE WE TRY TO CONNECT THEM TO SERVICES AFTER THEY'RE OUT AND OFTENTIMES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. THERE'S A LACK OF FOLLOW THROUGH SO DO WE HAVE THE MEANS TO BE ABLE TO. I'M SAY MANDATE BUT BUT REALLY ENCOURAGED THAT THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE MADE SOONER THAN LATER. ACTUALLY THE PLANTS REQUIRE THEM TO FOCUS ON RE ENTRY SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW RE ENTRY IT SHOULD BEGIN WITH YOUR ENTRY INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM- I THINK THAT'S THE BEST PRACTICE THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN MOVING TOWARDS AND THAT THE THAT THE REHABILITATION AND THE WORK THAT WE DO- WHILE SOME OF THIS IS IT WITHIN OUR CUSTODY OR OVER SUPERVISION- EVERYTHING SHOULD BE GEARED TOWARDS FOCUSING ON SUCCESSFUL RE ENTRY- AND THAT IS PART OF THE- THAT IS PART OF THE PLAN THAT THE COUNTY MUST ADMIT. THAT WE WILL BE REVIEWING AND AGAIN FORGIVE ME IF I MISSED IT THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE- A NEW CAR NEW I WANTED TROUT DIDN'T GIVEN JUSTICE YOUTH OF. ARE MEETING RESTORATION AND THEY'RE GOING TO INNER INTERFACE WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AS MANY OF THESE YOUTH ARE DULY- INVOLVED IN TWO TO SYSTEMS. ABSOLUTELY I MEAN AS I MENTIONED THAT I'M A DEPUTY SECRETARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BUT I REALLY SEE THIS OFFICE BEING WITHIN OUR AGENCY AS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY INTERACT VERY DIRECTLY WITH THE DIRECTORS OF OUR VARIOUS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. I'M ALSO VERY SPECIFICALLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT THIS STATUTE DICTATES THAT THERE MUST BE A LOCAL COMMITTEE THAT PUTS TOGETHER THIS PLAN AND THOSE KINDS OF PARTNERS LIKE CHILD WELFARE WE PART OF THAT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU BUT CENTER MELINDA'S- CENTER PAN. TERAPIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE AN OUNCE OF FRIENDLY BUT- OR THERE'S A REAL ISSUE STAFF THE COUNTIES COMING UP PLANS ARE THERE STATEWIDE METRICS THAT APPLY ACROSS ALL COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT- THE- THAT WE HAVE- THE WAY TO MEASURE THE OVERALL SUCCESS AS WELL AS HOW EACH COUNTIES DOING RELATIVE TO OTHER COUNTIES. YEAH GREAT QUESTION- I CAN GIVE YOU A FEW MORE DETAILS BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PART OF THE STATUTE THAT- DOES EXPLORE AT UPDATING A SYSTEM THAT I WORKS ARE AT THE TOP OF MY NAME I CAN'T RECALL THE NAME- BUT IT IS IT FOR THE PURPOSES OF REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT TO THE METRICS NEED TO BE FOR THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION- I BELIEVE THAT THAT- TRANSITION OR OR THAT RECOMMENDATION EXCUSE ME THAT WOULD COME FROM. THAT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON HOW TO IMPROVE THAT COMES TO OUR OFFICE WITHIN THE FIRST FEW YEARS- BUT IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY FRANKLY TO DEVELOP THAT AND TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES THAT SUBMIT AS DATA TO DEVELOP DATA REPORTS FOR ALL OF YOU AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IT AND ATION OF THAT. WAS TO HOUSE A RESEARCH SPECIALIST RESEARCH DATA SPECIALIST WITHIN OUR UNIT- AS WELL AS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I REALLY ENVISIONED AS HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY YOU SOME BAR CONTRACT PLANS- TO HELP DEVELOP GUIDANCE AROUND WHAT KINDS OF DATA WE SHOULD BE COLLECTING AND WHAT KINDS OF DATA WE WANT TO WORK FOR ALL OF YOU AND HAVING THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT LEVEL OF ANALYSIS- LEAKAGE EXCEPT. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO RELEASE DATACORE OF THE ASKED FOR JUST. WITH OUR VARIOUS DEPART. OBVIOUSLY SIR THESE KIDS IN CHILD WELFARE. BEHAVIORAL PROGRAM EXCEPT. OKAY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF IS THAT. AND I GUESS THE ONE CAUTION I WOULD HAVE THE SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY GAUGES AND RESEARCH IS THAT WE DON'T WANT OVER DATING FOR DATA BURDEN PEOPLE ETHER SO. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT INTERESTING YOU SPEAK TO IS THE TIMELINE FOR DEVELOPING THESE METRICS BECAUSE IT'S HARD YOU CAN'T BUT YOU KNOW THE METRICS YOU CAN'T DO A DATA COLLECTION METHOD WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO COLLECT SO. YOU SPEAK TO THE TIMELINE WHICH ANTICIPATE WITH THE STATEWIDE METRICS WOULD BE DEVELOPED SO THAT FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE WITH A FOLLOW UP ON THAT. YEAH I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I'M NOT SURE I KNOW THE SPECIFICS ON THE TIMELINE I APOLOGIZE I HAVE TO. GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST US BECAUSE WE DO IT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THAT. D. O. J. AND SO. IF YOU- IF THAT WOULD BE A CAMPAIGN TO GET BACK TO I DON'T WANT TO BE INCORRECT. I'M PUTTING TOGETHER A TIME LINE FOR YOU OKAY NO THANK YOU- THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO GET A TIME LINE I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR OUR DELIBERATIONS BEFORE WE FINALIZE BUDGET TO HAVE THAT TIME LINE AND BE SURE THAT THE TIMELINE IS SUCH THAT WE WILL. KNOW WE WILL HAVE TIMELY- ACCESS TO. DATA TO EVALUATE THIS PROGRAM SO I APPRECIATE THAT IF YOU GET BACK TO THE STAFF OF THE TIMELINE. OF BEFORE WE REVISIT THIS ISSUE- AT. NAY REVISED THAT WOULD BE EXCELLENT THANK YOU. YES CENTER. IN THE SEVENTIES FROM THE HOSPITAL. THINGS WE WANT TO HELP. PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN OVERFUNDED OR IF YOU ARE A NUMBER OF YEARS AND YOU CONSEQUENCES THAT IS WE HAVE A NUMBER MANY MANY AB ONE THOUSAND NOW. ONE WAS. LIVING ON THE SOME ISSUES THAT YOU CAN YOUR NOT. I THINK WE- OF THE AND THE REQUESTED- COUNTIES WERE NOT FROM TO BRING TO ADEQUATELY. ADDRESS THEM OF THE ON NOW WE HAVE THE YOUTH SUFFICIENT POINTED OUT SOME OF THE MOST- THE BEER RESPONSES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. AND BEGAN OPPORTUNITY QUESTIONS DOWN TO THE COUNTY LEVEL WHERE RESOURCES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE I'M JUST WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT WHY YOU THINK THAT THIS TIME- YOU THINK IT WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO DO WHAT WHAT EXPERIENCE. IT WAS A LITTLE BIT HARD TO HEAR YOU BUT I THINK I GOT THE MOST OF IT WHICH WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS THAT THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH RESOURCES LOCALLY TO SEVERITIES KIDS ADEQUATELY- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD ALSO- WHAT I WOULD ALSO SAY IS THAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S A MUCH BETTER USE OF FUNDS TO SERVE THESE. CHILDREN OR YOUNG PEOPLE- LOCALLY AT IT ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO. SAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DOLLARS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THESE INDIVIDUALS GRADUATING INTO THE ADULT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH LOCAL JAILS- AND OR BUT UNFORTUNATELY MAYBE EVEN ENDING UP IN ANY OF OUR STATE FACILITIES- AND SO. I THINK THAT- THIS IS AN AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT RESEARCH WOULD SAY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND THAT ULTIMATELY. IS GOING TO SAVE THAT THE LOCAL. COUNTY MONEY BUT ALSO BE. IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE YOUTH AND THE FAMILIES AND I THINK GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES- AND SO I THINK WE FEEL PRETTY I THINK WE FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT WILL ALSO OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE REALLY LOOKING AT THE EXPENDITURES THAT IS DEFINITELY PART OF THE PLAN REVIEW PROCESS. IT NIGHT YOU PROBABLY A BIT WITH DIFFICULT TO HEAR ME. I'M JUST. IS TO SUMMARIZE BECAUSE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT IDEALLY. WE WOULD. GET THIS PRINTED UP THE PROBLEM RIGHT RATHER THAN DEAL WITH IT. BACK IN THE OFFICE I DON'T DISAGREE. IN MY- I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THEIR RE ENTRY PROCESS SHOULD START REALLY ONCE THEY- ENTER THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT'S BETTER FOR EVERYONE BUT MY CONCERN. IS- YOU KNOW HAVE TRIED THIS BEFORE IN THE STATE WITH WHEN WE CLOSE DOWN THE STATE HOSPITALS AND CREATED A COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES AND THAT HAS NOT WORKED AS AS EVIDENCED BY THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE WE SEE IN THE STREETS OF MENTAL ILLNESS ISSUES AND WE'VE SEEN THIS WHEN YOU DON'T ALLEN'S WORK CHRISTIANITY COUNTY LEVEL. THE COUNTIES WERE GIVEN THE MONEY AND THE RESOURCES. PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND THINGS THAT THEY NEEDED IN THE- IN I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN WITH THIS JUVENILE POPULATION SOMETHINGTHAT REALLY WAS THERE. THE COURT MY QUESTION WAS. YOU KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME. WHY YOU HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE THAT THIS TIME. IT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE AND IT'S GOING TO WORK. I THINK THE THING THAT I WOULD SAY IT IS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING AND EXCITING NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO EXPAND AND MAKE A VERY FOCUSED EFFORTS ON INVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM- WELL NOT ALL OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE CERTAINLY MANY OF THEM. I HAVE SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES AND I THINK WE'RE REALLY. WE'RE TRYING I RECOGNIZE WITH WHAT THE U. SAYING CLEARLY YOU KNOW MY BACKGROUND SO- I'M I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT WE WANT TO INVEST MORE IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM IMPACT. I KNOW. CONSIDERING THAT THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE TWO OTHER SENATORS WHO ARE HERE. EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO THAT AND SO I THINK WE REALLY MADE AN EFFORT AS THE ADMINISTRATION IN THIS PARTICULAR YEAR YOU REALLY LOOK AT THAT BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTINUUM. AND AGAIN. THESE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WILL BE SERVED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES CAN REALLY LEVERAGE THOSE PROGRAMS. THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE INVESTING IN- THE ONLY PART OF THE SEATING AS ADDITIONAL SERVICES SO- I RESPECT YOUR PERSPECTIVE. I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING- BUT A VERY- I FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THESE CHEAP THAT THESE CAMPS AND ALSO THAT THE. COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR- THE NEW YORK QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE REALLY- OKAY THEN WE WILL LEAVE THIS OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. HEY MAN THIS IS MARK ON EACH WITH HOUSING HUMAN SERVICES THE LAST ITEM IN THIS MARKET IS THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION REAPPROPRIATION. AND AGAIN MY COLLEAGUE FOR SELF DRIVING IS GOING TO TAKE THE LEAD IN CREATING A GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN HI. THIS IS A RESPONSE TO THE COMMITTEE'S FIRST QUESTION- TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW HOW DOES THIS PROPOSAL IS REQUESTING TO RE APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS THAT- THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WORK- GIVEN THE PRIORITIES TO COATED IN THE VACCINE ROLLOUT. THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION WAS PUT ON HOLD. BACK IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY AND THIRTY MINISTRATION WAY WORKING ON PLANS TO RESUME PUBLIC MEETINGS. THIS SPRING.

NOW LAST SUMMER WE ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FIRST REPORT WHICH WAS FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL WHICH WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS THIS STORE- CURRENT STATE OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND JUST TO GO ON TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION- REGARDING THE RELEASE OF THE SECOND REPORT. WORSE STILL WORKIN ON THE PLAN TO RESUME THE PUBLIC MEETINGS FOR THE COMMISSION WHAT WE EXPECT FROM THE WORK ON THE SECOND REPORT TO CONTINUE THIS SPRING AND INTO THE FALL. AND WE DON'T EXPECT THE SECOND REPORT TO BE FINALIZED TOM ANY SOONER THAN EARLY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS HERE BUT CENTER GRANTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AS I GUESS ONE THE X. OFFICIALS ON THE COMMISSION- APPRECIATE THE WORK I LOOK FORWARD TO- THE COMMISSION CONTINUING ITS WORK- YEAH THAT- HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A LITTLE BETTER ENGAGEMENT WITH COMMISSIONERS FOR THE SECOND REPORT THEN WE DID THE FIRST ONE. BUT OVERALL I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- THAT WE CONTINUE THIS- VERY IMPORTANT EFFORTS SPECIALLY WITH THE NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION.

THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES SYSTEM WAS CREATED BACK IN EIGHTY ONE BY HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE DIVISION TWO POINT FIVE WITH THE INTENT OF CREATING A STATEWIDE SYSTEM. WITH EMSA RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION OF ALL STATE ACTIVITIES CONCERNING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. TO ENSURE A PROVISION OF EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. I AM SAYS A SMALL DEPARTMENT WITH SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITIES THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES FALL PRIMARILY INTO THREE CATEGORIES OR DIVISIONS. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY SERVICES- THAT'S ONE PIECE OF EMERGENCY CARE NETWORK THAT'S INTEGRATED WITH HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER SERVICES. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND CERTIFIED EMTS. TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND LICENSEDPARAMEDICS THAT RESPOND TO ABOUT FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION NINE ONE ONE CALLS. I CAN ONLY. IN THEIR OVERALL FORTY TWO HUNDRED GROUND AMBULANCES AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN AIR AMBULANCES WITHIN THAT SYSTEM SO THESE FOLKS RESPOND TO THE ILL OR INJURED. AND LET ME THEM TO ONE OF THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS OF IT MAY ALSO BE DESIGNATED SPECIALTY CENTERS. FOR TIME SENSITIVE EMERGENCIES LIKE TRAUMA STROKE SCAMMY- SPECIFICALLY ANSWER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING PARAMEDICS IN DISCIPLINING THOSE LICENSES WHEN NECESSARY PROVIDING SCOPE OF PRACTICE TRAINING STANDARDS REGULATIONS FOR ALL EMS LEVELS. INCLUDE INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST DAY- THERE'S BEEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS CONCERNING MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS ALIGNED FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL ASKING MS ALSO WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION- IN ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE PIECES SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE.

THE RESULTS OF THESE PILOTS DEMONSTRATE THAT PARAMEDICS CAN EFFECTIVELY IN SAFETY WORK SAFELY WORK. WITH PATIENTS TO REDUCE REPEAT HOSPITALIZATIONS DECREASED NINE ONE ONE CALLS. REFORM OUTRAGE FOR HARD TO REACH PATIENTS AND IDENTIFY PATIENTS SECOND BETTER BE TREATED IN SETTINGS. OTHER THAN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. ALL WITHOUT DISPLACING ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. SECONDS CATEGORY OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR RAMPS- THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS A TWO TIERED SYSTEM OF EMS RESPONSE SO WE HAVE A TYPICAL TEACHER RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES EPSRC DEVELOPS GUIDELINES AND APPROVES PLANS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATED BY LOCAL EMS AGENCIES OFTEN KNOWN AS LAMB SAYS. SO THERE ARE THIRTY THREE LAMB SAYS THAT INCLUDE TWENTY SIX SINGLE COUNTY LANCERS ENDS IN MULTI COUNTY LEADS US OF THE MULTI COUNTIES TYPICALLY SERVE LARGE RURAL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA- THESE LOCAL LAMB SAYS DIRECT NINE ONE ONE AMBULANCE SERVICE.

ONE OF OUR PRIORITY INITIATIVES IS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EMS SYSTEM. USING IMPROVE LOCAL AND REGIONAL DATA SO WITH THE SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN TWENTY NINE WHICH WAS CHAPTER IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE HAVE CONVERTED ALL PROVIDERS TO ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTATION OF PATIENT CARE THAT CAN BE AGGREGATED ANALYZED. USED FOR SYSTEM EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT. WE HELP LOCAL EMS SYSTEMS. IN PROVIDERS EXCHANGE CLINICAL DATA WITH HOSPITAL SO THAT PARAMEDICS CAN OUT PATIENT INFORMATION IN THE FIELD AND HOSPITALS CAN RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM YOUR MOUSE OF THIS INITIATIVE ALSO IMPROVES CARE DURING A DISASTER BY MAKING CRITICAL PATIENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE. WHEN PATIENTS ARE TREATED IN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. ON THE THIRD A MAJOR AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT SFA. ADMINISTERS IS THE MEDICAL RESPONSE TO DISASTERS WE'VE BEEN SO. FIND IN OVER THE LAST YEAR I AM SO PARTNERS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH UNDER WHAT'S CALLED THE ESFA ESFA GUIDELINES TO BUILD A PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESPONSE EMERGENCY SYSTEM.

OF THESE UNITS ALONG WITH AMBULANCE STRIKE TEAMS ARE ROUTINELY USED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SECOND MULTI CASUALTY EVENTS OR HOSPITAL EVACUATION. OF THE STRIKE TEAMS WERE RECENTLY USED TO EVACUATE OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY WILDFIRES. INTO TRAIL SCORED TO APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS OUT OF IMPERIAL COUNTY TO RECEIVE HOSPITALS RECEIVING HOSPITALS AND- THE LINE CARE FOR THOSE FOLKSTHAT DURING THE COLD NINETEEN SURGE PROMINENTLY HOW BACK IN MAY AND JUNE. THIS SECOND TIER CONSISTS ALSO OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TEAMS YOU'LL HEAR CALMATTERS FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO. THAT CAN DEPLOY WITHIN TWELVE HOURS OF ACTIVATION AND SUPPORT ANY LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE ONE OF THE MOST FLEXIBLE DIRECT PATIENT CARE ASSETS THAT WE COVER A BECAUSE THEY CAN BE DEPLOYED AS A FIVE TO FIFTY MEMBER HEALTHCARE TEAM. ARE THEY CAN TAKE ON HEALTH CARE MISSIONS RANGING FROM ACUTE EMERGENCY CARE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF EVACUATED LONG TERM CARE PATIENTS WE'VE EVEN HAD COME OUT TEAMS IN HOSPITALS OVER THE LAST A- RESPONSE FOR COVERAGE.

QUESTIONS SO THE FUNDING IS THIS TO THE THIS DOESN'T LOK LIKE IT'S FOR STATE STAFF IS JUST TO PAY FOR A LOCAL STAFF AT THE REGION'S I JUST. LIKE LOW CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THE MONEY IS CORRECT IT'S A REQUEST FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING OKAY SO WE WILL GRANT IT TO A LOCAL ENTITY WITHIN HIRE THE PERSON. OUR PAY FOR HER PART OF THE PERSON. OKAY YES SIR OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THE THURMOND IS. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER FOUR COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC OR TRIAGE- YEAH THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS TO POSITIONS IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF- AT SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE OF FORTY OF SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. TO IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE PROJECTS FOR LOCAL EMS AGENCIES PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR STATUES OF TWENTY TWENTY. AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR CREATES THE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE ARE TRIAGED ALTERNATE DESTINATION AFTER TWENTY TWENTY. WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE A LOCAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY OR LAMBS ARE TO DEVELOP AND SEEK APPROVAL FOR A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES VARIOUS THE VARIOUS COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS IN TRIAGE PARAMEDIC SERVICES. COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE IS A NEW ANY EVOLVING METHOD OF COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH CARE IN WHICH PARAMEDICS FUNCTION OUTSIDE OF THEIR CUSTOMARY EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRANSPORT ROLES. HERMETIC PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC LOCAL PROBLEMS AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LOCALLY DEVELOPED COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. CALIFORNIA THROUGH MS- IN THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT HAS PILOTED COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC PROGRAM FOR SIX YEARS INDEPENDENT EVALUATORS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO I FOUND THE PILOTS TO BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MEANS OF UTILIZING PARAMEDICS. TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC ALLOWING EXPANDED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND CASE MANAGEMENT. SB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR REQUIRES ENDS OF THE PROVIDE ONGOING SERVICES IN OVERSIGHT TWO LENSES REGARDING COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS PROMULGATE AN UPDATE MULTIPLE CHAPTERS OF REGULATIONS. AND IT SAYS HERE THAT. THE PROJECTS ARE TESTING SEVEN DIFFERENT CONCEPTS FOR THE PRACTICE THE WHICH ARE LISTED BUT WE ALSO SEE FOURTEEN PROJECTS ARE STILL IN ROLLING AND SOME HAVE ALREADY CEASED TO EXIST FROM THE- FROM TO HELP THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WHAT WERE THE OUTCOMES FOR THOSE DO WE KNOW AND WHAT KIND OF METRICS ARE WE MEASURING JUST ALL THE METRICS. THAT ARE LISTED IN FORTY PEOPLE APPLIED TO DO ONE OF THE SEVEN OR ALL OF THE SEVEN FOUR IS THAT A COMBINATION. WHEN COMMUNITIES APPLY FOR THAT. THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION I'M GOING TO DEFER TO OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR LOUIS BROWN KEY TO PROVIDE AN ANSWER ON THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR TELEMATICS THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. IN THE OVERSIGHT FOR THOSE OR THE- FOR THOSE PROGRAMS WAS PROVIDED- THE SYSTEM EVALUATION WAS PROVIDED. BY THE UNIVERSITY OF. SAN FRANCISCO WHO MONITOR THE PROGRAM AND- IN COLLABORATION WITH EMSA AND ARSHAD I DEVELOPED A- EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. AND THE IN THE OUTCOME THE ANSWER IS- WHAT IS CURRENTLY APPEARING THE- REPORT OR- PUBLICATION. WE'RE SO PREPARING THE REPORT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE OF THE OUTCOME IS YET THE OUTCOMES WERE ALL FAVORABLE AND THEY CONTRIBUTED TO THE- TO THE- THAT. LEGISLATION AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR. THAT WILL IT WHAT BEGAN. IN ON JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. MAY I ALSO ADD ONE QUICK COMMENT LOS UPON ME- DURING THESE PILOT PROGRAMS WE'VE ALSO HAD EXTENSIVE AND DETAILED QUARTERLY REPORTS ALIGNED ON ALL THE PILOT PROGRAMS LOOKING AT SPECIFIC METRICS AND OUTCOMES ALONG THE WAY FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THEN WE GET A MORE DETAILED ANNUAL REPORTS SO WE'RE WE'RE CAREFULLY MONITORING METRICS OUTCOMES WITH RESPECT TO ALL. SEVEN OF THE PILOT PROGRAM- CATEGORIES OF THE OTHER ANSWER THE OTHER QUESTION YOU HAD WAS A PICK ONE OR A COMBINATION ARE THEY CAN'T PICK A COMBINATION SOME COUNTIES ARE INTERTWINED IN. HIS MANY AS TWO OR THREE OF THESE CATEGORIES BUT MANY OF JUST TAKEN ONE CATEGORY ON. OKAY BUT IS THERE IS THERE ONE THAT PEOPLE TAKEON MORE THAN THE OTHERS ONE THAT'S USED MORE. ALL TAKE THAT AS WELL- AND I WILL ALSO REMEMBER ONE OTHER QUESTION YOU ANSWERED WERE YOU ASKED WHICH WAS- YOU KNOW HELLO FOLKS DROPPED OUT OR OR HOW MANY AND WHAT'S TENDED TO HAPPEN IS- SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS HAS HAS DRIED UP IN A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE PRIMARILY BASED ON FUNDING ISSUES. I THINK THE MOST COMMON OF THIS SEVEN- IS THE SOBERING CENTER IN THAT WE HAVE I THINK THREE DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT HAVE TAKEN OUT ON. BUT MANY MANY HAVE TAKEN ON TWO OF THESE SO IT'S FAIRLY UBIQUITOUS UBIQUITOUS ACROSS THE- THE LIST OF SEVEN. HOSPICE WOULD BE THE LEAST. A DOCTORED PROGRAM- IN PLACE CURRENTLY- THAT INDIRECT DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY FOR TUBERCULOSIS THOSE TO HAVE BEEN SORT OF A MINIMALLY ADOPTED BUT CLEARLY STUDY. THANK YOU OKAY I THINK YOU KNOW JUST TO ADD DENTAL TO TOUCH A COP DR DUNCAN SCOTT COMMENTS ON THE- PRO PROGRAMS HAVE ENROLLED- FIVE THOUSAND AND NOW THREE MIDDLE AND IN THE MENTAL HEALTH. PROGRAM HE END UP IN THE ALTERNATE DOES DESTINATION SOBERING CENTER PROJECTS IN ROME IT WAS TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE. BUT I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND DIE I DID HAVE A CHEAT YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL WENT THROUGH THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND- I KNOW THAT- WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE FOLLOWING DATA I BELIEVE THAT- MANY OF THEM DID SHOW GOOD RESULTS- THE POST DISCHARGE SHORT TERM FOLLOW UP I THINK THAT RESULTS OF SOMEONE NEXT- AND- AND I THINK THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS THEN. ABOUT- HOUSE ALSO THAT WAS SO I THINK WE MAINLY IN THE BILL EXPANDED THE OTHER ONES AND SAID WILL SORT OF. BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS I SEE THAT NOW THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL OF COURSE IS ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF. THE ANALYSIS DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY MENTION THIS BUT IF IT DOES REFER TO. FUNDING GOING TO THE M. S. INFORMATION SYSTEM AND OF COURSE WE'RE HAVING. IT TECHNOLOGIST ETCETERA. THE IS THERE GOING TO BE ON GOING EVALUATIONS OF THE PREVIOUS PILOTS WERE OF- THERE'S A CONTRACT I THINK WAS UCSF THE DID THE EVALUATION ARE THEY STILL GOING TO CONTINUE TO. DO AN EVALUATION OR IS THAT GOING TO BE BROUGHT IN IN STATE THAT'S ALL WE CAN CONTINUE THE VALUATION IS GOING TO BE DOING THAT AS WE'RE EXPANDING THIS UP. THE PROGRAM. THE FOURTEENTH OF. FORTY FOUR- IT PROVIDES FOR THE CREATION OF AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO OVERSEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGULATIONS SURE FRANK V. PARAMEDICINE PROGRAM IN THE- IN THE- EVALUATION BUT WILL- CRITERIA WILL BE A- DEVELOPED BY THE ACTED BY THREE COMMITTEE AND IN- WHICH WILL BE SUPPORTING THEM SO. IN THE PROPAGATION OF THE OF THE REGULATIONS. CRYSTAL CLEAR FIVE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE EVALUATION WILL BE DONE IN HOUSE INSTEAD OF BY UCSF WHICH DID THE INITIAL EVALUATION CORRECT. IT WILL BE BILL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAMS. AND THAT WILL BE DONE BY UCSF WE HAD WE HAD IT AT THIS POINT. OKAY A CONTRACT WITH THEM TO CONTINUE THE EVALUATION THEN. OKAY IS THAT IS THAT ACTUALLY OUTLINED IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL I DIDN'T SEE THAT. LOOTED AND A PIECE THAT'S REFER TO. YES DOCTOR DOCUMENTED THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. OKAY IS THAT THE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ARE I MEAN I'M JUST AND I'M BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE HOUSES ON THE SHORTS COMING OUT OF. OKAY LOVE YOU CAN THAT PLEASE- CLARIFIED THAT- FOR ARE WE YOU KNOW. AS WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET MOVING FORWARD I DON'T I KNOW THAT WE DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME. INTO THAT BUT- AT THE TELEPHONE NO- VALUATION YOU KNOW SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO USE USE YEP THAT'S FINE I MEAN THEY DID THE PREVIOUS ONE RIGHT EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY. IT'S GOING TO BE DONE- YELPING CONTRACTED FOR THE EVALUATION TO HAVE KNOWN AT LEAST THE RANGE MAYBE THE BIT HASN'T GONE OUT YET. AND SO FORTH- I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE THAT INFORMATION THANK YOU. CERTAINLY DOCTOR WE WILL ENSURE THAT YOU. GET THAT INFORMATION. OKAY THANK YOU. CENTER OF HONEST QUESTIONS. OKAY SHALL WE MOVE ON THEN. THIS IS RICHTER ALSO BE SPEAKING ON ISSUE FIVE OKAY WHICH IS REGARDING OUR COVE IN NINETEEN FUNDING AND- YOU- QUESTION NUMBER ONE IS TO PROVIDE A BRIEF ACCOUNTING OF ALLOCATIONS OF FUNDING. MS OUR FOR PANDEMIC RELATED EXPENDITURES AND FISCAL YEARS NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE UNDER SB EIGHTY NINE. I AM SO RECEIVED TEN POINT SIX FOUR SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS UNDER SB EIGHT EIGHTY NINE OR SECTION THIRTY SIX ADJUSTMENT. WE UTILIZE THAT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW VENTILATORS THE REFURBISHMENT OF EXISTING VENTILATORS ALREADY POSSESSED BY THE STATE. AND IN THE VENTILATOR CERTIFICATION BY- LICENSED BY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS- THE FUNDING WAS ALSO USED TO PROVIDE PATIENT TRANSPORTATION MEDICAL STAFFING AND STAND BY SERVICES AT VARIOUS LOCALS MEDICAL SITES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR MOVE ON QUESTION TO- I WOULD GUESS I WOULD DISTINCT CARRY ALSO YOU WHAT WE DO WITH ALL THE TRADITIONAL RESPIRATORS THAT WE PURCHASED GOING FORWARD. IF WE DID A WHOLE BUNCH MORE FOR THE PANDEMIC. THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY A QUESTION FOR ME- THESE HAVE ALL BEEN EVALUATED REPACKAGED CHARGED AND READY TO DEPLOY- WE'VE DEPLOYED ON THE- CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LOT MORE THAN THAT I'M JUST DOUBLE CHECKING- WE HAVE TWELVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AVAILABLE- THE PROJECTIONS. ALIGNED A WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT WOULD REQUIRE OVER TEN THOUSAND VENTILATORS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THAT NUMBER IN PLACE. WELL THAT'S SAID WHAT WILL WE DO WITH ALL THESE WE WILL CAREFULLY STORE THEM IN A TEMPERATURE REGULATED ENVIRONMENT BIOMED THEM AS REQUIRED TO KEEP THE FUNCTIONAL IN THE EVENT THAT THERE REQUIRED AGAIN. ALL RIGHT. BUT DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT ACTUALLY I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AFTER MAYBE AFTER THE ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS OKAY THAT'S IMPOSED. PLEASE PROCEED- SO QUESTION NUMBER TWO WAS PRODUCED PROVIDED REVIEW COUNTY REVOCATIONS STEMS OF FOR PANDEMIC RELATED EXPENDITURES IN THE TWO FISCAL YEARS UNDER THE JURY OR THE DISASTER RECOVERY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT. DURING THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS MS OUR RE HAS RECEIVED FROM THE JURY ACCOUNT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FOUR POINT TWO SEVEN FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THIS FUNDING HAS BEEN USED IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES AMBULANCE TRANSPORTS OF BIO MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CALMAC PERSONNEL SUPPORT. IT'S ME CAL MASS HOURS AND BENEFITS CHALAMET SUPPORT. MS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS. MS OUR OVERTIME HEALTH CORPS PERSONNEL SALARIES AND BENEFITS HEALTH COURSE SUPPORT- MEDICAL SUPPLIES- PURCHASE OF PP. TRAVEL EXPENSES FOR BOTH ENDS AND CAL MAN STAFF AND AS WE JUST DISCUSSED THE PURCHASE OF VENTILATORS- SO ALL RIGHT AND JUST FOR MY UNDERSTANDING YOU. YOU ARE THE PURCHASER FOR THE PP THAT THEN GOES TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY. NO WE ORIGINALLY AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WE ESSENTIALLY SPENT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON PP. SINCE THEN- CDPH AND DGS AND OTHER ENTITIES HAVE BEEN PURCHASING HE P. E. AND WE ARE- CORRECT- WHEN WE NEED P. P. WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THROUGH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. IF THE CARD. A QUICK QUESTION ON THE HEALTH CARE FOR UP HEALTHCOR PERSONALE- LOOKS LIKE WE SPENT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION AND REAL FUNDING. HE I KNOW WE DOES A STRAIGHT A HOW MANY PEOPLE SIGNED UP BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY. SO HOW HOW MANY HEALTH CORPS PERSONNEL WAS THE THREE POINT FOUR MILLION CAN GET A LITTLE BREAK DOWN IN TERMS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE DEPLOYED. AND SO FORTH THAT- WE- EXPENDED THIS FUNDS FOR. YOU'RE VERY WITH ME ONE SECOND- WE LARA EIGHT APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN HEALTH CORPS MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO VARIOUS MISSIONS SINCE THE PANDEMIC HAS BEGUN. THAT WOULD INCLUDE SITES SUCH AS SLEEP TRAIN ARENA SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ELDER CARE FACILITIES LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. OKAY SO IN THE SUM OF MONEY THE THREE POINT FOUR MILLION- WHAT KIND AND WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY COVERS A WEEK CALL THAT DEPLOYMENT- BUT IS THAT ALSO FOR EXAMPLE PAY FOR THEM OR OTHER EXPENSES I MEAN I THINK IT COMES OUT TO ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PER PERSON SO. DOES THAT IS SALARIES AND BENEFITS OKAY IT'S ALWAYS BENEFITS OKAY THANK YOU- OKAY. QUESTION NUMBER THREE IS A BRIEF ACCOUNTING OF THE ALLOCATIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING TO MS- FOR PANDEMIC RELATED EXPENDITURES IN THE TWO FISCAL YEARS NOTED FROM FEMA I'M MS OUR HAS RECEIVED MOST OF OUR COVERT RESPONSE FUNDING VIA THE JURY- AND S. B. EIGHTY NINE WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY FEMA FUNDING DIRECTLY FOR RESPONSE ACTIVITIES HOWEVER WE HAVE STARTED THE FEMA REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS AND WORKING WITH- YES TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR US TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY FEMA. WELL SO- I UNDERSTAND THE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MONEY WILL BE REIMBURSED BY FEMA- AND MAYBE IT'S MORE A QUESTION FOR FINANCE THAN FOR YOU- SO IF WE DO GET REIMBURSEMENTS FROM. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR SOME OF THESE EXPENSES THAT WE RECOUNTED FOR- HOW THIS IS THAT FUND IS THAT MONEY COME BACK TO- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO READ DISPERSE ARE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- THAT IT JUST DOESN'T GO INTO A POT THAT SOMEONE ELSE DISPENSES WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT SO I REALIZE YOU KNOW WE SPENT THIS MONEY WE MAY OR MAY NOT GET BACK. CERTAIN AMOUNTS FROM FEMA- AND FREESHEET THE REPORT BUT I JUST WANT CLARITY ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE WHEN WE DO GET THE REIMBURSEMENT WHENEVER THAT MAY BE THAT- WE HAVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HEALTH OF ON. HOW THAT FUNDING BECAUSE THAT GRAYSON THAT RELEASES NEW FUNDING THAT- WE HAVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER HOW THAT FUNDING WILL BE REGIS BE DISPERSED. REFINANCE BY HARDWARE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WHEN WE RECEIVE THAT A FEMALE IN THE FORMER REIMBURSEMENTS- THE SHIP WILL GO WITH YOU TO THE STATE- GENERAL FUND. OKAY SO WE'LL GO INTO THE- GENERAL FUND AND THEN WE WILL THROUGH ARE. YOU THE BUDGET PROCESS OTHER PROCESSES THEN DECIDE HOW THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE USED THANK YOU. TWENTY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU DOCTOR. OKAY NEXT. HELLO QUESTION NUMBER FOUR PLEASE PROVIDE A BRIEF ACCOUNTING OF ALLOCATIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING DAMS ARE FOR PANDEMIC RELATED EXPENDITURES IN THE TWO FISCAL YEARS FROM THE CORONAVIRUS RELIEF UNDER OTHER DIRECT FEDERAL FUNDING- MS IS NOT AGAIN RECEIVE NO DIRECTION AT ALL FUNDING FOR RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SINCE DECEMBER AND WE HAVE PROVIDED THEM APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN A LATER EXPENSES WHICH ARE. A WHICH WILL BE REIMBURSED THROUGH THE CORONA VIRUS RELIEF FUND DIRECTLY BACK TO THE STATE- WE ARE AND ACT SUPPLYING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR THE REMAINING EXPENDITURES FOR THE VENTILATOR PURCHASES AND UPKEEP AND MAINTENANCE. THAT WILL BE PROVIDING BY THE START OF MARCH TO FINANCE SO THEY CAN ALSO INCLUDE THOSE PART OF THE CORONA VIRUS RELIEF FUND. THANK AND THEN THERE'S THAT THAT TAKE CARE OF A BAD NUMBER FIVE AS WELL. YEAH WELL IS MY ANSWER IS THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING TO BE RECEIVED DURING TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON THE LEVEL OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE STATEWIDE EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE INVOLVED WITH- IS KIND OF DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW. GETTING ON THE WAY THIS PANDEMIC IS GOING. TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WILL NEED TO COVER WHICH RESPONSE ACTIVITIES IN THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR. OKAY OF BEFORE WE MOVE ON ANY FINAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS DR. AFFECT THANK YOU- SO JUST TO CLARIFY YOU SAID YOU DO YOU- IN TERMS OF SO WE JUST THE HEALTHCARE GOVERNMENT JUST PASSED THE STIMULUS PACKAGE- SIGNED BY- THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT'S AT THE END OF THE YEAR. WE MAY HAVE ANOTHER ONE THAT'S WORKING THROUGH CONGRESS- WHAT'S THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS BY WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THIS MAY BE A QUESTION FOR FINANCE MORE SO- TO THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WIN IN NEW FUNDS MAY BE ANTICIPATED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AS WE TRY TO MAKE OUR BUDGET DECISIONS WE WILL I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE SO YOU KNOW WE'RE FOLLOWING BUDGET STATE FUNDS WE WOULD ALSO NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING IS COMING TO WEAR TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPORT. ACROSS YOU KNOW FOR THE ENTIRE YOUR RESPONSE OR SERVICE AND- APOLOGIZE EMS YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE UP ON THE AGENDA SO THIS IS SOMETHING ON FRIDAY ASKING OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL- BUT- I JUST WANT TO GET CLARITY AS FAR AS- HOW THIS NEW FEDERAL FUNDING SOME MAY SHOW UP AND VARIOUS- PACKAGES WAS THE LAST TO MILES'S ARE JUST ANOTHER PACKAGE GOING THROUGH. HOW'S THE LEGISLATURE NOTIFIED IF THERE ARE THINGS WE'VE ALLOCATED FUNDING FOR WE'RE BUDGETING FUNDING FOR THAT THERE'S NOW FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MONEY THAT'S COMING IN FOR THE SAME THING OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR SO THAT WE CAN REVISIT AND LOOK AT WHETHER DEBT TOTAL ALLOCATION.

THAT WE GET NOTIFICATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AS THESE DIFFERENT- YOUKNOW FEDERAL PACKAGES ARE PASSED AND WE GET INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. THAT WE HAVE TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO GET TO VARIOUS OF OUR OWN RESPONSE ACTIVITIES SO WE CAN MAKE. THE OPTIMAL USE. OF OUR STATE RESOURCES I'M SURE DEMONSTRATION SHARES THETHING. SAME THING BUT IT WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR US. AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO MAKE. APPROPRIATE DECISIONS O. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE VERY TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF ANTICIPATED FUNDS- THAT MAY COME AS A RESULT OF FEDERAL ACTIONS. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE TIMELY DECISIONS ABOUT STATE RESOURCES.

ASHRAE HAS MADE PROGRESS IN MEETING ITS PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS AND STATUTORY MANDATES AS A RESULT OF THESE READ DIRECTIONS. HOWEVER THERE IS STILL MORE WORK TO DO WE STILL HAVE PROCESSES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED IN OVERTIME FOR STAFF IS VERY HIGH THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDETHE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR US TO ACHIEVE FISCAL COMPLIANCE.

WORKLOAD OR WHAT HE'S SPEAK PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT TOO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH DATA PLANNING FUND. OKAY LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THAT HERE.

RIGHT SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE ARE TAKING POSITIONS THAT WERE FUNDED BY THE- DATA FUND AND THOSE GET MOVED OVER INTO THE PROGRAM THIRTY EIGHT SIXTY ONCE THOSE POSITIONS GET MOVED INTO THIRTY EIGHT SIXTEEN THERE'S AN ALLOCATION PROCESS THAT OCCURS. OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY IT'S JUST MONEY MOVING OUR POSITIONS ALSO MOVING. THIS IS MONEY MOVING OKAY SO ANOTHER WORDS ESSENTIALLY THE POSITIONS ARE STILL THE SAME JUST FUNDING FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S THE CLARIFICATION I WANTED OKAY I WASN'T SURE OF THOSE PEOPLE OF POSITIONS WERE MOVING THEN THERE'S A RE ORIENTATION IN TERMS OF. EFFORT THAT I WANT TO CLARIFY BUT IF THAT'S MAINLY IT'S WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM BUT THE POSITIONS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY STABLE THAN THAT. THAT'S FINE OKAY THANK YOU DR GRANT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE NO FUNDS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM ANY OF OUR SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS- OR RESIDENCY SUPPORT PROGRAMS.

LIFE CYCLE- WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES REQUIRE A MEDIC CAL DEEPER SERVICE MANAGED CARE DATA- AND- WERE ALSO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP THE REGULATIONS WHICH MUST BE IN PLACE BY THE END OF DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THAT WILL OVERSEE THE COLLECTION OF COMMERCIAL I DATA FROM HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS OKAY SO THAT'S EXCELLENT SO WE'RE TALKING LIKE JULY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND I NEED TO DEVELOPING THE VARIOUS PIECES- JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE OBVIOUSLY DIAZ- YOU HAVE TO. I GUESS ANONYMIZE THE DATA DE IDENTIFIED THE DATA IS AS ANY. IN IT IS EARLY WAYS IN WHICH PART RELEASED PORTIONS OF THE DATA WITH THE FOR PROPRIA PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN PLACE- WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC OR TO RESEARCHERS- FOR INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS BEYOND- THE STATE.

COSTS OF LITIGATION RECENTLY SHIFTED TO OUR- TO PROVIDE FEES LITIGATION EXPENSES THEPRESENT BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO INCREASE TRANSFER FROM MANAGED CARE FUND AN INSURANCE FUND. SHOULD BE PRESENT SOURCE ABBAS PODS DRUG COST TRANSPARENCY PROGRAM IS REQUIRED BY STATUTE. WITHOUT HAVING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. BUT IN JUST THE PAUSE FOR SECOND CENTER MELINDA STILL ON BOARD WE LOSE YOU OKAY. CLOSE WE HOPE YOU'RE BACK THEN YOU'RE OKAY. HI ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE THANK YOU DOCTOR SPEND EGGMAN- SO I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AS THE GOVERNOR HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS BUDGET RELEASE YET MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE AND HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WHILE LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE HOUSE THE OFFICE WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THIS YEAR PROPOSES TO HOUSE IT WITHIN OPTION AS- WELL CALIFORNIA HAS HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN EXPANDING COVERAGE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IS A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON INDIVIDUAL CALIFORNIANS. EMPLOYERS AND THE STATE. WE NEED FULL ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES IS SIMPLY NOT. POSSIBLE WITHOUT AFFORDABILITY SO BUILDING ASHRIDGE WORK DEVELOPING THAT EACH TV THAT THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENTS DATABASE THAT WAS JUST DISCUSSED THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WILL COLLECT DATA. ON THE TOTAL COST OF CARE IN THE STATE AND SET COST TARGETS FOR THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. THE OFFICE ENFORCE COMPLIANCE OF THOSE TARGETS THROUGH PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT AND FILLING GAPS IN MARKET ANALYSES OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACTS YEAH PARDON THE IMPACT MARKET COMPETITION. PRICES QUALITY ACCESS AND THE TOTAL COST OF CARE. NOTE THAT THE MARKET ANALYSES WOULD FOCUS ON THOSE HEALTHCARE TRANSACTIONS THAT DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A PROCESS SO THE AGENDA RIGHTLY NOTES THAT DMH CCDI AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE OVERSIGHT OF MANY TRANSACTIONS AND WE WHICH WE WOULD FILL IN THE GAPS WHERE THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY OVERSIGHT. WELL THE FOR ARCHING GOAL IS TO LOWER COSTS THE OFFICE WANTS TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS NOT DONE AT THE EXPENSE OF QUALITY. EQUITY OR WORK FORCE ACCORDINGLY THE OFFICE WILL PROMOTE HEALTH CARE WORK FOR STABILITY AND TRAINING THESE. REPORT QUALITY PERFORMANCE AND EQUITY METRICS ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ADVANCE PAYMENT MODELS THAT REWARD HIGH QUALITY COST EFFICIENT CARE AND PROMOTE INVESTMENTS IN PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WILL BE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE OFFENSE WE DO HOPE TO RELEASE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE VERY SHORTLY AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING INPUT FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS. BUT THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFICE THAT I'LL GO AHEAD AND ADDRESS UNLESS YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. YOUR INITIAL TWELVE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND DRESS THE CURRENT AND I DO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. OF COURSE. IN TERMS OF HOW THE OFFICE WOULD SET COST TARGETS- WE WOULD COLLECT DATA- AND SET AN OVERALL HEALTH CARE COSTS TARGET GROWTH FOR PER CAPITA SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO SET SECTOR AND REGION SPECIFIC TARGETS. SO THE TARGETS WOULD BE BASED ON- A PARTICULAR OR A COMBINATION OF ECONOMIC INDICATORS SUCH AS GROSS STATE PRODUCT FOR THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED A SIMILAR COST GROWTH TARGET HAS HAVE TO HAVE TAKEN DIFFERENT CHOICES- OR SOMETIMES HAVE GONE ABOVE OR BELOW. A GIVEN ECONOMIC INDICATOR. THE SENATE OF DIFFERENT TARGETS WILL BE BY HISTORICAL COST DATA AND OTHER RELEVANT DATA WITH CONSIDERATION AGAIN FOR A FOR ACCESS QUALITY EQUITY AND WORK FOR STABILITY. THE METHODOLOGY AND PROCESS FOR REVIEWING AND UPDATING THE COST GROWTH TARGETS WILL BE INFORMED BY STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPORT EXPERTS THE REVISED REPORT. SO WE WAITED TO BE OFFICE WILL BEGIN SETTING THE BENCHMARK TARGET IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY THREE. AND THEN BEGIN COLLECTING TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE DATA FROM PAYERS AND WE WOULD HAVE THEM BREAK IT DOWN BY SERVICE CATEGORY SUCH AS HOSPITAL CARE INPATIENT OUTPATIENT PHYSICIAN SERVICES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE COST TARGETS MAY BE ADJUSTED FOR INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE ENTITIES ONE WARRANTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ENTITIES BASELINE COSTS IN COMPARISON TO OTHER HEALTHCARE ENTITIES THAT OUR REGION OR HEALTH CARE SECTORS. THE NEXT QUESTION ASKS HOW THE COMPLIANCE AND PENALTY PROCESSES WOULD BE ENFORCED SPECIFICALLY AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL- SO IN COMBINATION WITH THE DATA REPORTED BY PAYERS THE OFFICE WOULD ALSO BE GETTING AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORTS FROM PROVIDERS TO DETERMINE HOW PROVIDERS ARE PERFORMING AGAINST THAT COST TARGET. TO THE EXTENT OF PROVIDER EXCEEDED THE COST TARGET ENFORCEMENT WOULD BE VERY MUCH PROGRESSIVE SO IT WOULD BEGIN WITH ASSISTANCE TO BRING THE PROVIDER INTO COMPLIANCE- LOOKING AT THE DATA. MAKING SURE IT'S ALL CORRECT HAVING THE PROVIDER SUBMIT A CORRECTED CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS- AND IF THAT DOES NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUES THEN. THERE IS THE ABILITY TO ASSESS PENALTIES. IN TERMS OF WHAT DATA WOULD BE. USED TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE AN APPEALS PROCESS THE OFFICE WOULD DETERMINE OMPLIANCE USING DATA COLLECTED BY THE OFFICE- AGAIN. A LARGELY FROM THAT FROM THE HEALTH CARE ENTITY ITSELF. AND THEN THROUGH THE PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS THE HEALTH CARE ENTITY WOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO REVIEW AND SEE CORRECTION- WITH THE OFFICE. THERE CERTAINLY WOULD BE AN APPEALS PROCESS SO WE WOULD WE WOULD ASSESS THE PENALTY AND THEN THERE WOULD BE FORMAL DUE PROCESS OPPORTUNITIES TO CHALLENGE AND NON COMPLIANCE DETERMINATION INCLUDING ADMINISTRATORS. AND ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS AND RIGHTS FOR THE- SO THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE IN THE AGENDA I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU- IT APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I KNOW THAT THIS WAS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- AT LEAST BECAUSE IT WAS AN OFFICE OF AFFORDABILITY I THINK THERE WASN'T AS MUCH DETAIL- AND THE LAST. PROPOSAL AND THEN OF COURSE CODE HERE. I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE WELL I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND- AND HOPE THAT WE CAN GET CLARITY ON THIS IS- THE BUDGET PROCESS MOVES FORWARD AND I KNOW THAT- MY COMPATRIOT- ASSEMBLY CHAIRS THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE IS ALSO WORKING ON SOME OF LEGISLATION AS WELL SO. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THESE IN THE POLICY CONTACTS AS WELL AS THE BUDGET CONTEXT. BUT I'LL I WOULD MAKE NOTES THAT- YOU TALKED ABOUT THE STATUS IN CART COST TARGETS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. BUT AS I JUST ASKED HER COLLEAGUES- FOR THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE WE DON'T EXPECT THAT TO GET UP UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT THERE AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU GUYS COLLECTED DATA FROM THE HEALTH CARE ENTITIES THEMSELVES. BUT IT S. FIND IT. INTERESTS ME I GUESS I'LL FIND IT CHALLENGING TO THINK THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE DATA ON THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT NOW THERE STILL BE SOME LIMITATIONS ON ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. THE LARGER PICTURE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON BUILDING THIS DATABASE OVER TIME AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST YEAR WE'RE STARTING ON THAT SO IT DOES TAKE TIME AND EFFORT TO DO THAT. BUT YET WE'RE GONNA BE SETTING COST TARGETS A YEAR BEFORE WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA. TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS COST TARGETS MAKES SENSE AND HOW THEY FIT IN THE OVERALL PICTURE. SO AND THEN WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA FORCE PEOPLE BEFORE EVEN HAVE THE OVERALL PICTURE- SO I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL- THAT- ACTUALLY WELL AS THE SECOND LARGEST SECTION YOU KNOW PART OF THE BUDGET OF THE STAFFING REQUEST IS ACTUALLY THE INVESTIGATION ENFORCEMENT BRANCH I GUESS THE FOLLOWS AFTER THE I. T. BRANCHES WITH THE L. FOURTEEN POSITIONS FOLLOWED BY FORTY FOUR POSITIONS. THE FOLLOWING FIVE EIGHT FIFTY TWO POSITIONS. SO I GUESS CONCERN IS THAT AND I. YOUR A PRESS- BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT- WERE. GETTING A LITTLE AHEAD OF OURSELVES NOT FOR OF TERMS AFFORDABILITY IF NOT OPPOSED TO THE IDEA IN OFFICE AFFORDABILITY. BUT THAT OUR APPROACH IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SET COST TARGETS IN THE ABSENCE OF- GOOD DATA. AND I WILL TELL YOU TO SOMEONE WHO STUDY QUALITY IMPROVEMENT YOU KNOW WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS WE TRY TO MOVE FROM WHAT WE CALL EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE WHICH IS PEOPLE LIKE- WE GOT. YOU KNOW EXPERTS AND FAMOUS PEOPLE OF PROCLAIMING WHAT SHOULD BE. VERSUS EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE WHICH IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE DATA. SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS WE ACTUALLY COST TARGETS BASED ON EVIDENCE. PEOPLE WHO. ARE SELF PROCLAIMED EXPERTS AND YEAH PRAYER DO HAVE ACTUALLY SOME EXPERTISE. BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF DATA IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT THEY'RE MAKING THEIR JUDGMENTS BASED ON AND THEN ACTUALLY HAVING PENALTIES ON PEOPLE FOR THAT. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THIS DISCONNECT. THIS LARGER DATA AND HELL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND ESTABLISHING COSTS WE'RE SORRY YOUR CONFERENCES ENDING NOW PLEASE HANG UP. THERE YOU GO. A YES ANSWER. SO WE'LL TRY TO PROCEED UNLESS WERE WERE KICKED OUT YES. YEAH OKAY- RESEARCH FOR ONE OF THIS MANUAL HOLDEN RECESSED. MANY HEARING BACK TO ORDER HELLO GLITCH WE THINK BUT WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD. ALL RIGHT. THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION DOCTOR GEORGE AND WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THE ANSWER DOCTOR PENSION PRESSURES YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YEAH ARE WE GOING TO ENFORCE THINGS BEFORE WE HAVE THE DATA WE'RE GONNA WE ARE NOT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION DOCTOR PAN WE LOVE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA THAT THE ALL ARE ALL PLAYERS CLAIMS DATABASE ARE EACH P. PROGRAM WILL BE COLLECTING AND THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. SO THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WILL BE COLLECTING AGGREGATE COST DATA FROM PAYERS SO THAT WILL INCLUDE- ALL OF THE COSTS IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SO- NOT. CLAIMS PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS- ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS PROFITS COST SHARING PAID TO CONSUMERS THAT AGGREGATE DATA THAT'S COMING IN TO THE- OFFICE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY STARTING IN IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE- ARE ALL PAYS PAIRS CLAIMS DATABASE ARE HEALTHCARE OUR HEALTH CARE- PAYMENTS DATABASES YOU KNOW IS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON CLAIMS DATA SO IT DOESN'T GO TO THE TOTAL COST OF CARE PER SE THE DATA COLLECTED BY THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY- IS TRYING TO GET TO THE TOTAL COST OF CARE- WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE COMPLETE. SELF AND SHORT- DATA AT THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WHERE IS THE H. P. D. WE'RE HAVE TO SEE HOW MUCH THE SELF INSURED PLANS CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE- IT'LL BE VOLUNTARY. SO H. P. D. WILL BE. USED AS- CALL STRIVE THAT WERE. BUILDING ON THAT DAY. BUT THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE. WILL HAVE TO COLLECT- ITS OWN AGGREGATE DATA TO DETERMINE COST OF CARE SO WE'LL BE DOING THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND SETTING- ACROSS TARGETS. AND HEN HAVING THAT THE SECTOR BASED ON THE LINE SO IT IS A VERY PROGRESSIVE PROCESS OKAY SO- AND AGAIN IN. THE PERHAPS SOME OF THIS WEEKEND- TAKE A LITTLE- OFFLINE LATER BUT I JUST. SO IF YEAH I GET IT THAT THE ITS CLAIMS DATA YOU'RE GETTING AND THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE BUT THE DATA YOUGET FROM ANY HEALTH PLAN IS ALSO CLAIMS DATA SO YOU- SO THE DATA YOUR PLAN TO GET FOR YOU YEAH YOU KNOW YOU MADE REFERENCE TO HEALTH CARE ENTITIES IS THIS NOW GOING TO BE A REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY PROVIDER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE TO PROVIDED PROVIDE AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORTS TO THIS ENTITY I MEAN THAT SOUNDS LIKE A HUGE BURDEN. AND ACTUALLY HUGE TASK EVEN PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH STAFF YOU HAVE YOUR EVEN FOR THE AYE EVEN FOR THE HUNDRED THREE I. T. PEOPLE YOU EVENTUALLY BE BUDGING FOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THE HANDLED EVERYONE'S HAVING TO SEND AUDITED FINANCIAL DATA TO THIS OFFICE. SO CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT SOURCE OF SOURCES OF DATA. S. IT'S NOT CLAIMS DATA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE COLLECTING AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO COLLECTED I MEAN ARE YOU GONNA MANDATE THAT PEOPLE PROVIDE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EVERY PRACTICE IN THE- STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AGAIN DR PENSO YES MOVING FORWARD IN ORDER TO- MEASURE WHETHER A GIVEN TO HEALTH ENTITY IS MEETING THE COST TARGET WE WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE TO GET AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A LITTLE CLINIC PRACTICE. NOW AS WELL SO WE WILL BE DEVELOPING REGULATIONS DEFINING- HEALTHCARE ENTITIES AND EXCLUDED HEALTH CARE ENTITIES AND CERTAINLY WE WILL NOT BE. IT IS NOT ENVISIONED THAT THE OFFICE WILL GO DOWN TO TWO YOU KNOW AND I'M A MOM AND POP PROVIDE OKAY SO ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK- MY CONCERN IS THAT IN WHICH CASE YOU ALSO HAVE A MISSING PIECE OF DATA THERE RIGHT SO. WE GOT YOU KNOW YOU ONLY WANT TO COLLECT THE DATA FROM THE BIG ONES AND YOU KNOW I'VE DONE BILLS AND I KNOW WE WORK TOGETHER ON- I AND I AND I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW GET DATA BUT I JUST. WANT TO. BE CAREFUL ABOUT AND AGAIN I'M NOT OPPOSED TO AN OFFICE OF AFFORDABILITY AND I THINK THERE'S THINGS WE NEED TO DO. I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT DEALS WE HAVE DELIVERED ON ONE SIDE. ON THE FLIP SIDE- KNOWN RECOGNIZING TRYING TO MINIMIZE DATA BURDEN. IS ALSO INCOMPLETE DATA RIGHT SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE GAPS RIGHT SO. ARE THEY GONNA HAVE SO YES THE LARGE ENTITIES PROVIDE A MAJORITY OF THE HEALTHCARE BUT NOW I'M GOING CREEK COST TARGETS THAT ARE BASED ON. JUST THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LARGE IDENTITIES AND WHAT'S GOING ON SMALLER ENTITIES IN FACT OFTENTIMES IS WEIRD EVEN DEALING WITH VACCINATION DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER THINGS ABOUT COVE IT IF YOU GO LOOK AROUND AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHERE I PRACTICE. I SEE A LOT A LITTLE MOM AND POP STUFF GOING ON BECAUSE- THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY ARE LARGER WITH MORE MONEY TEND TO GO TO MIDDLE CLASS AREAS THERE'S MORE MONEY THERE. SO AT SO I IT JUST. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LOT OF THOUGHT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT. ABOUT HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THIS SO THAT. AND AS WE'RE TRYING TO APPROACH THIS IT THE ISSUE AFFORDABILITY THAT WE DON'T MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON INCOMPLETE OR DISTORTED DATA. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE DOING COST TARGETS OF PENALTIES AND I KNOW AND I APPRECIATE THE STAGE THEN YOU'RE NOT JUST HITTING PEOPLE IN THE HAMMER WITH WITH THE RIGHT AWAY. BUT IT CAN CAUSE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE DISTORTIONS AND DATA AND THEN THERE'S CONSEQUENCES TO PEOPLE. THEN YOU START GETTING- BEHAVIORS THAT ARE- NOT NECESSARILY OPTIMAL FOR CARE YOU GET BEHAVIORS THAT ARE RESPONDING TO THE SIGNALS THAT YOU'RE SENDING THAT CLASS AND YOU CAN HAVE THE FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIORS. SO HI. YEAH IF I MADE AFTER PAN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE QUESTION SO I THINK WE WANT TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN SETTING THE TOTAL COST OF CARE. AND THEN THE COMPLETE AND THEN MONITORING COMPLIANCE- AT THE SECTOR OR PROVIDER LEVEL SO IN TERMS OF CALCULATING TOTAL COST OF CARE THAT WILL BE DONE WITH DATA FROM THE PAYERS NOT FROM THE PROVIDERS. SO IN TERMS OF ANY CONCERN ABOUT IF A GIVEN A PROVIDER ISN'T SUBMITTING THEIR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE WON'T BE USING THOSE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL COST OF CARE AGAIN WILL BE USING AGGREGATE DATA FROM THE PAYERS. RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE WE NEED TO SET A SECTOR TARGETS WE USED. HOSPITAL OR LARGER MEDICAL BROUGH- FINISH STATEMENTS TO MONITOR. OF OUR WELL I'D- BY A SECOND GET FOR THIS HEARING. I'VE THE RESPONSE I LOOK FOR TO FOR CONVERSE. I THINK THEM THE DETAILS DO MATTER. AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT TOO AND I JUST- I THINK I WANT TO BE A LITTLE CAUTIOUS ABOUT- HOW WE'RE APPROACHING THIS SO THAT WE DON'T CREATE PERVERSE INCENTIVES I KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE- YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT AND THAT YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN EITHER. BUT I THINK WE DO NEED TO HAVE SOME FURTHER CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GETTING- PLAN DATA THAT'S CLAIMS DATABASE THAT'S ALSO THAT BACKS TO THE- PURPOSE OF AN OFF FAIR CLAIMS DATABASE IS. CAPTURING THOSE PLAN REIMBURSEMENTS I MEAN THAT'S- A THAT'S CLAIMS DATA SO YOU'RE GETTING THAT'S CLAIMS DATA ON THE FLIP SIDE YOU TRYING TO GET COST ACTUAL COST DATA THEN YOU'RE HAVING TO GET FROM THE PROVIDERS UNLESS YOU THINK CLAIMS REFLECT THOSE IN WHICH I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME THAT. WELL WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT SO WE DO NEED TO SORT THESE KIND OF THINGS OUT. I THINK EVENTUALLY WE DO WANT TO GET THEIR FOR AFFORDABILITY AND THERE'S SOME BROUGHT THINGS WE CAN DO- BY LOOK FOR TO THIS CONVERSATION AND- I THINK THERE'S THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS THAT. WE'D LIKE TO HAVE SORTED OUT BEFORE. WE DO THIS AND FOR EXAMPLE- JUST BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THE QUESTION IS FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE NEED INVESTIGATION ENFORCEMENT AND WHEN I GIVEN THE TYPES OF DATA THAT WERE AVAILABLE AVAILABLE AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME AT WHAT POINT. YOU KNOW DO THEY- DIG INTO WHAT ITEMS SELL AND AGAIN THIS IS A SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY SUPPORTED LEGISLATION FOR MORE OVERSIGHT OVER CONSOLIDATION LAST YEAR HERSELF. OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT OPPOSED TO LOOKING. AT THESE DRIVERS OF COST THANK YOU. CHU COOLEY WILL A LOT MORE CONVERSE. ON ON THIS FUND BUDGET ITEM I AND I KNOW IT'S- WITH DARK WOOD YESTERDAY HE'S GOT ALOT OF. INTERESTING IDEAS AS WELL SO. WE'LL DO A LOT OF COLLABORATION AS WE GO FORWARD TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT. WE WELCOME THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR LAST ITEM- IS GOING TO BE PRESENTED BY DEPUTY DIRECTOR KAREN MYSELF THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON- RIGHT MY NAME IS KAREN RIGHTS OUT AND I'M HERE WITH TE HEALTH CARE WORKERS FROM DIVISION I WILL ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING ISSUE SIX. I'M FIRST QUESTIONS PLEASE PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE BUDGET INCLUDES A THREE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT TO GROW AND DIVERSIFY THE PIPELINE FOR THE GERIATRIC MEDICINE WORKFORCE. INCREASING AND DIVERSIFYING THE NUMBERS OF OLDER ADULTS LIVING LONGER LIVES REQUIRES DEVELOPING A LARGER AND MORE DIVERSE POOL OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS THE EXPERIENCE IN GERIATRIC MEDICINE AND CARE. THE CALIFORNIA ALZHEIMER'S TASK FORCE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLAN ON AGING. REPAIRED REPORTING RECOMMENDED THAT CALIFORNIA BESTING CAREER INCENTIVES FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. THE FUNDING ALLOWS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO PURSUE CAREERS IN HEALTH FIELDS EXPAND THE CAPACITY TO SERVE. OLDER ADULTS. TO IMPLEMENT THE SPENDING HOSPITAL USE EXISTING HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS INCLUDING PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY PROVIDE AWARDS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO SERVE GERIATRIC POPULATION. WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS WE CAN MAKE AWARDS MORE EASILY AND QUICKLY. OUR PROGRAMS ALREADY FOCUS ON EXPANDING PROVIDER DIVERSITY AND INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL REQUEST MULTI YEAR EXPENDITURE OF THEIR OWN TO ALLOW OUR SPEND SUFFICIENT TIME TO ADMINISTER THE FUND- SECOND QUESTION HOW WOULD ARCH VENTURE THESE FUNDS SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT GERIATRIC REMINDERS. AND WOULD THERE BE SLOTS IN THE EXISTING WORKFORCE PROGRAMS DEDICATED TO GERIATRIC PROVIDERS. AS STATED PREVIOUSLY WE WERE USING EXISTING PROGRAMS TO IMPLEMENT THIS FUNDING. AND WE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY PROVIDE AWARDS TO GERIATRIC PROVIDERS. FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM ALREADY CAN PROVIDE TOWARDS THE POSITIONS THERE'S PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIANS' ASSISTANTS WITH A SPECIALTY IN GERIATRICS AND GERONTOLOGY. THE STEVEN M. THOMPSON PRECISION CAR LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM AWARD PROVIDERS WHO AGREE TO PRACTICE IN GERIATRIC CARE SETTING. BUT PRIMARILY SERVES ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE FOR ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES. WE CAN ALSO USE OUR OTHER MOMMY PAYMENT PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS FOCUS ON NURSING ALLIED HEALTH AND LICENSE MENTAL HEALTH. AWARD PROVIDERS THAT SERVE OLDER ADULTS BY MODIFYING OUR APPLICATION TO INDICATE WHETHER THEY ARE PROVIDING GERIATRIC CARE. YOU ALSO GROW AND DIVERSIFY THE GERIATRIC HEALTHCARE PIPELINE WE HAVE THE MANY GRANTS PROGRAM. A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO INTRODUCE YOU AND STUDENTS TO HEALTH CARE CAREERS AND WE WILL MODIFY THIS PROGRAM TO INCLUDE EXPERIENCES THE GERIATRIC POPULATIONS IN GERIATRIC CAREER. THE THIRD QUESTION DOES ARE SPENDING TEN TO ADDING NEW GERIATRIC SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OR CONDITIONS. THE SCHOLARSHIP OR LOAN REPAYMENT AWARD SUPPORTED BY THIS REQUESTED FUNDING. FOR SOME PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE STEVEN THOMPSON LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM AWARDEES ALREADY PROVIDERS PERIODIC DOCUMENTATION TO SUPPORT THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING GERIATRIC CARE NEED THEIR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER PROGRAMS WE WILL ADD A REQUIREMENT AWARDEES PROVIDE PROOF OF POPULATION SIR THE PHOTO THEIR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I FOUND. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION CERTAINLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL- THE ONE I GUESS THE ONE COMMENT I WOULD JUST MAKE IS THAT- AND CERTAINLY THIS PROPOSALS ABOUT TRYING TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN HELP ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ENTER TRAINING IN PARTICULAR SPECIALTIES LIKE GERIATRICS WE ALSO TO BE SURE THERE'S A STRONG MARKET FOR THEM WHEN THEY FINALLY FINISH YOUR TRAINING INTO WORK SO. UNTIL CERTAINLY THIS PROPOSAL ITSELF IS EXCELLENT I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALSO EXAMINE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS THE- PAY STRUCTURE AND THE FINANCING OF SERVICES FOR SENIORS I KNOW WE HAVE A MASTER PLAN ON AGING THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT BUT THAT GOES TO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT MONEY WERE PUT INTO THINGS LIKE I. HSS INTO NURSING HOMES AND SO FORTH LIKE ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO HIRE GERIATRICIANS- TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF CARE. OR OR WEAKENED STRAINING THEIR RESOURCES SO THAT THEY ARE NOT AS MANY POSITIONS AVAILABLE- TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN THESE FIELDS SO APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO INCREASE THE TRAINING AND THAT'S GREAT YOU NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE ALSO HAVE- IN OUR POLICIES IN OTHER AREAS THAT WE CREE OPTING FOR THEM TO BUILD CAREERS WANT. TO COME OUT TRAINING IN THIS FIELD AS WELL THANK YOU. ANY COMMENT FROM A FINANCE OR HELLO. OKAY WELL THAT COMPLETE THIS SECTION AND WE THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR PRESENTATION.

SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE GMAC HAS SAVED CALIFORNIANS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION IN HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS THROUGH OUR RATE REVIEW PROGRAM. AND FINALLY OUR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT PROSECUTE VIOLATIONS OF THE KNOX KEEN ACT THE GMAC MAY USE A VARIETY OF TOOLS TO ENFORCE THE LAW WHEN VIOLATIONS AREN'T COVERED SUCH AS CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN SETTLEMENTS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. FINANCIAL PENALTIES CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS A FREEZE ON A ROMAN AND INSTALLATION OF MONITORS ARE CONSERVATORSHIP. THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW OF OUR DEPARTMENT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. APPAM OF FOR MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENT. I DID HAVE SOME- ON THE- SAYS IT INVESTED UNDER THE OTHER TWO- SO FIRST OF ALL- THE- IN TERMS OF THE TIMELY ACCESS REPORTS SO YOU KNOW WE HAD SOME PROBLEMS SEVERAL YEARS AGO I KNOW THERE'S A LAG- IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF DATA. AT LEAST ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS DALY SAID SOME ERRORS REMAIN SO WHAT'S BEING DONE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE REPORTS THAT YOU GET.FROM THE HEALTH PLANS AND MINIMIZE THE ERRORS FOR QUALITATIVE SUBSEQUENT YEAR BECAUSE THAT'S POINT OUT BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS DISK SUBCOMMITTEE SHOCKINGLY GOT REPORTED NINETY PERCENT. OF ALL THE INFORMATION WE GOT WAS BAD- SO- I KNOW IT'S MUCH BETTER NOW CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE QUALITY OF DATA THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY REPORT AND HOW DO YOU EXPECT THE QUALITY DATA WILL BE. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT- THAT IT NEXT YEAR IN TERMS OF. THE BECAUSE THAT DATA COLLECTIONS HAPPENING NOW. NO NO GOOD QUESTION AND I WILL SAY THAT TWENTY FIFTEEN MEASUREMENT YEAR WHICH IS THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORTED SHE MENTIONED- WE COULD NEVER REPORT ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE DATA SUPPORT- WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT. WE CONTINUE TO REFINE AND WORK WITH THE PLANS ON THE FINALLY REQUIREMENTS IN THE TEMPLATES- SO WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN- THE OTHER THING THAT WE ARE WORKING ON AS WE ARE- ACTUALLY INFORMAL RULEMAKING RIGHT NOW IN OUR TIMELY ACCESS REGULATION- AND SO WE ARE CODIFIED IN OUR METHODOLOGY AND OUR APPROACH TO THE TIMELY ACCESS MEASUREMENT. PROCESS WE ALSO HAVE A RATE OF COMPLIANCE IN THEIR- AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD CLIENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RATE OF COMPLIANCE- THERE'S A LOT THAT WE WILL BE DOING IN TERMS OF OUR REPORTING OUT I'M NOT. ONCE NOT REGULATION- IS IT'S APPROVED AND I BELIEVE WE JUST CLOSE OUR SECOND COMMENT. ON THAT SO. AGAIN WE COME A LONG WAY ON THE DATA ERRORS AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK- THROUGH THAT. AND JUST A REMINDER TO THAT WHEN WE WHEN PLANS HAVE DATA ISSUES WE ALSO DO MAKE REFERRALS TO OUR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT OKAY AND THEN I GUESS THE FOLLOW UP AND I UNDERSTAND YOU SAID YOUR- AND SECOND COMMENTARY FOR YOU REGULATIONS. FIVE MILLION THE ROUTES. THE REPORT ITSELF- NO THAT FOR FULL SERVICE HEALTH PLAN- WE HAVE WAIT TIMES THE- WILL. GOOD NEWS SUMMER 94% BAD NEWS ONLY 52% AND FOR URGENT APPOINTMENTS- THE WAIT TIME- THE SURVEY PROVIDERS AGAIN GOOD THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MINIMUM STANDARD SHOULD ALWAYS BE A HUNDRED PERCENT. AND THEN TO A LOW OF FORTY FIVE PERCENT. SO AND THESE ARE BECAUSE THE MINIMUM STANDARDS. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO- AND I KNOW YOU'RE NO HOPEFULLY WERE FINALIZING REGULATIONS SOON MAYBE CAN MATCH WHAT THE TIME LINE IS FOR THAT. BUT SO WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU HAVE. CURRENTLY SOME PLANS REPORTING. FOR APPROXIMATELY LESS THAN HALF OR HALF OR STUDENTS EVEN LESS THAN HALF A NIGHT POINT OUT THE URGENT- THAT IN TERMS OF NOT MEETING THE STATE TIMELY ACCESS. STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. I REQUEST SO A COUPLE OF THINGS- ONCE WE HAVE THE REGULATION OF THIS FINAL WE WILL WE WILL FINALLY HAVE A RATE OF COMPLIANCE THAT IS A LOT THAT WE CAN FOR IN FORCE AGAINST- WHAT'S EMBARRASSING RATE IN THE- IN THE REGULATIONS. WHAT'S THE PROPOSED RATE MINIMUM RATE OF COMPLIANCE HE PERCENT SENATE IT'S 0% MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE LET ME RESPOND TO LITERATURE WHICH SHOULD ALWAYS BE A HUNDRED PERCENT- AGAIN THE TIME WE HAVE TO SERVICE A POINT IN TIME SURVEY THAT IS MEASURING THE AVAILABILITY OF A SAMPLE OF PROVIDERS AT THAT POINT IN TIME- AT. ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME- THAT WE MAY HAVE PROVIDERS THAT- ARE ON VACATION AND- FOR OTHER REASONS. OUT ALSO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE EXACT PROVIDER THAT YOU WANT AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME- THE NETWORK NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A TIMELY ACCESS APPOINTMENTS AND SO WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO ASSESS THE CAPACITY OF THE NETWORK TO MEET. THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE UP IN THE LAW- AGAIN THAT 70% COMPLIANCE RATE WILL BE ALLOW US TO MEASURE THE ABILITY OF THE NETWORK TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS- WE WILL ALSO THEN BE ABLE TO TAKE. CORRECTIVE ACTION ENFORCEMENT AGAINST THAT TIMELY ACCESS COMPLIANCE STANDARDS. I WILL ALSO JUST MENTION THE TIMELY ACCESS IS JUST ONE COMPONENT OF HOW WE MET MEASURE- CONSUMER ACCESS TO CARE- WE ALSO OBVIOUSLY HAVE OUR HELP CENTER MONITOR COMPLAINTS WE ALSO MONITOR. ON THE NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS AGAINST THE GEOGRAPHIC- AND PROVIDER RATIOS AS WELL SO IT'S ONE COMPONENT BUT WE WILL BE TAKING A HOLISTIC REVIEW. TO THE- ACCESS ADEQUACY OF. OKAY SO I A- I APPRECIATE THE WORD HOLISTIC REVIEW BUT- IN SOME WAYS THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS ARE WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROLE ROAD- I THINK IT'S- FOR US HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AS WE PASS LAWS AND WHEN THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS LAWS ARE PASSED I'M NOT SURE OF THE AUTHORS. OF THOUGHT THAT. THIS THE IN I THOUGHT THE STATE STANDARDS WERE SET PERCENT I MEAN I WHAT YOU'RE- AND I KNOW PACKED ISSUES. THAT FOR TO CHEAT A HUNDRED PER IS MAY NOT. TOTALLY REALIST BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE THE IS THAT. OKAY YOU SAID THAT SANDERS THAT WE PUT INTO LAW THAT YOU'RE NOW IMPLEMENTING TO REGULATION YOU ONLY HAVE TO HIT IT 70% IS THERE SOME MINIMUM STANDARD. LIKE SO WHAT'S THE TAIL OF THAT SO YOU KNOW WE GOT- WHAT'S A TALE OF THAT CURVE- THAT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS PLAN REALLY IS- ELSE OKAY THEY GOT PORTION. OF THAT 30% THAT'S REALLY DRAGGING OUT OR SOMETHING. IS AND AGAIN I KNOW YOU SAID HOLISTIC SO MAYBE LOOK SOME OTHER FACTORS BUT- I GUESS- I JUST. WANTED ONE BE CAREFUL THAT- WHAT. SHOULD PEOPLE REALLY EXPECT AND IS THAT REALLY GOOD ENOUGH. AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE PASS A LAW HERE- AND I DON'T I'M NOT SURE THE AUTHORS ARE THINKING LIKE- WHAT IS THE STANDARD 470% OF PEOPLE. AND I GET THE PRACTICAL REALITIES OF THIS SO I IT INTERESTING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I JUST WANNA BE REALLY. CAUTIOUS WITH THAT WHEN WE SAY SKILL OR THE PARTICULAR SPECIALTIES OR SOMETHING BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE SOMEWHERE MAYBE A LITTLE CHALLENGING TO GET BUT THEN. STRATEGICALLY ALLOWS. A PLAN NOT TO CONTRACT AS WELL FOR CERTAIN MORE EXPENSIVE SPECIALTIES OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT. MAY BE MORE CHALLENGING. AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE SKEWING SO I THINK WE NEED TO. SO CERTAINLY THE OVERALL PERCENTAGE IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR AREAS WHERE ACCESS IS. A PERHAPS LESSENED- IN THAT MAY BE MORE CONCERNING. THAN WHEN WE LUMP EVERYTHING TOGETHER. RESP THAT REALLY QUICKLY I THINK WOULD WORSEN THE RATE OF COMPLIANCE AND 70% WHAT WE'RE SAYING THAT IS THAT AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME WHEN WE MAKE THESE CALLS TO ASSESS THE AVAILABILITY OF AN- THAT SEVENTY. PERCENT COMPLIANCE INDICATE THAT IN MOST CASES OF A CONSUMER CALL THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. WITHIN THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. IT'S NOT SAYING 30% OF THE NETWORK NUMBER HAS AN APPOINTMENT AND TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS AND AGAIN. CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO GET A TIMELY APPOINTMENT WITHIN TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS EVERY SINGLE TIME AND IF THEY CAN'T- THE HEALTH PLAN IS OBLIGATED TO ALLOW THEM TO GO OUT OF NETWORK AT THE END NETWORK KASHIRI RATE SO I THINK. WE STILL HAVE THAT CONSUMER PROTECTION. THE 70% OF THE WAY TO WAS SAYS YEAH. IF THE- THE ABILITY OF THE NETWORK TO SUPPORT THE TIMELY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS IT MAY MEAN THAT IF YOU CALL THAT INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT YOU COULD CALL. IT A ONE OR TWO OTHER PROVIDERS WITHIN THE NETWORK AND BE ABLE TO GET IN A TIMELY. WELL THAT OKAY FAA APPRECIATES THAT- I THINK ULTIMATELY. IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THIS YEAR A REGULATORY AGENCY IS HOW YOU GO ABOUT ENFORCING AND AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE THIS DATA AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THAT DATA IS VASTLY IMPROVED NOW. THAT YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT ENFORCING IN A WAY THAT SENDS A STRONG ENOUGH SIGNAL. AND I KNOW MOST PLANS ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT- THE SENATE APPROPRIATE SIGNALS TO THE PLANS THAT- ARE. BEING MADE SEE. IS LOOKING CAREFULLY AT ACCESS AND I KNOW YOU ARE. BUT REALLY AND BEING SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS NUANCES. OF HOUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND THAT- THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES IF PEOPLE AREN'T IT IF THERE IS CAN IT'S YOU KNOW PEOPLE THERE ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE CONSISTENTLY HAVING CHALLENGES GETTING ACCESS THAT THE- AGENCY- AS THE REGULATOR WILL ACT. AND HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO TAKE COMPLAINTS A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DON'T COMPLAIN NOT BECAUSE- DATE AND THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM BUT- BUT OFTENTIMES YOU PEOPLE. MEAN FEEL LIKE ANYTHING WHAT. OR IS TO CALM. TO GO AND YEAH USUALLY TOLD THE CULT FOR AND THEN. THE END OF. LIKE YOU YOU SOMETHING AND- IT OUT FOR AWHILE THEN YOU CALL THE INMATES SEE ITS ADDRESS AND SET ITSELF. SO I THINK INTHE END WE WANT TO SEE. AND MY CONCERN BEFORE WHEN WE HAD THE BAD DATA WAS WELL HOUSE THE- HOUSE REGULAR GOING TO ENFORCE THE LAW. RIGHT AND SO- SO I THINK THE ULTIMATE RESULT IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. DATA ON. EXACTLY YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE FOR PLANS THAT TO DATE AT LEAST SEEMS OF. PEER TO SHOW. THAT ARE NOT MEETING THE STANDARDS AND- WHAT. WHAT STEPS. THAT THE- US REGULATORY AGENCY ARE TAKING TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING PREMIUMS ARE GETTING. WHAT THEY SHOULD BE GETTING. FOR THE- FOR WHAT THEY ARE PAYING. FOR AND THAT THEY GET THE CARE THEY NEED. NINE AND ARE REGULATIONS BE A GOOD. TO HELP HELP US TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT OKAY THANK YOU OKAY. OKAY THE MOVE ON.

CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. RICHARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION AND- I APPRECIATE I THINK WHEN THE BILL WENT THROUGH FOR THIS PARTICULAR- PILOT- I KNOW THAT THE ME SEE DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS- BUT NOBODY WANTED WHEN THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO MONITOR IS- IS ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE A LIMIT WELL THE LEMONADE BUT WE CERTAINLY DECREASE THE S. OR THE FINANCIAL RESERVE PART OF THINGS- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE SAID WELL THE TRUST FUND- IS- SO IT IS THE THIS PART OF THE VALUATION I KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS REQUIRED IN THE LAW. I THINK BUT CAN BE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED IS ALSO WHAT QUE EL IN WHICH WAYS THE BENEFIT DESIGN PERHAPS VERY FROM THE CURRENT STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE AND ALSO THE- IS THERE ANY POINT IN TIME IN WHICH THE- AND MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN- DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD THAT IS IN THE PILOT WHERE DEER MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXCESSIVE FINANCIAL RISK- AND HOW AND HOW OLD THE ENTITIES RESPONDED TO THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YEAH AND I KNOW THE PROVIDE FINANCIAL REPORTS IS THAT SOMETHING. TEAM MEETS HE'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AT. NOT WHAT WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OF THAT NOT EASILY WHAT THE FIGHT. RISK WE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE AN RBO OR A LIMITED OR RESTRICTED LICENSE PLAN THAT'S INVOLVED SO WE HAVE OUR ON GOING REPORTING OF THOSE ENTITIES. IN ADDITION TO THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE REPORTED BY THE BEEP AND TRUST FUND- WE'VE ALSO DONE A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT MANY OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN THE BOXYOU KNOW ACTOR ALSO PART OF THOSE SO. THAT WILL ALL BE PART OF WHAT WE REVIEW AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. OKAY WELL THANK YOU I THINK STEPS- A VERY. VERY IMPORTANT AND I ALSO KNOW THAT AND IF THEY DON'T IF MANAGER IF YOU DON'T HOUSES- ARE. NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO ISSUE THREE BUT I DO WANT TO JUST- APPRECIATE THE WORKERS TEAMMATE CS WE'RE DEALING WITH A COLD AND I KNOW IT'S NOT A BUDGET ITEM IMMEDIATELY BUT- IN TRYING TO- DO REGULATIONS TO ENSURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THINGS LIKE TESTING AND VACCINATIONS. I GUESS MY BUDGET QUESTION TO THAT IS THAT- AT LEAST THERE'S AT LEAST I HAVEN'T SEEN A BUDGET REQUEST SO IN TERMS OF DAEMI T.'S RESOURCES AND CAPACITY AND DOING ESSENTIALLY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THE DRESS CODE- IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY ADDITIONAL BUDGETARY REQUESTS IS THAT IS THE V. AS- WELL. SO THAT. I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE BANDWIDTH NECESSARY TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON ON. THESE REGULATIONS ENFORCEMENT- AS WE'RE TRYING RESPOND CODED. NO NO DO AND A GOOD. WE'VE YOUR- REGULATION AND I THINK WE UP TO A THIRTY ALL PLAN WATERS THAT WE'VE ISSUE. AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY COVERED RESPONSE HAS BEEN OUR PRIORITY FOR THE LAST TEN MONTHS NOW- AND WHO KNOWS TO AN AMAZING TEAM THAT WE HAVE THAT IS. HAS PRIORITIZE THAT WORK IN THE WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE USING ARE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. TO DO SO TO CONTINUE TO ENFORCE ABOUT THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ON pABSORBING THOSE COSTS WITHIN OUR WITHIN OUR EXISTING STAFF AT THIS POINT. OKAY THANK YOU FOR KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORK ABOUT THE L. K. WELL I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING. AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANY FEDERAL MONEY WILL EVER WILL TRICKLE YOUR WAY FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING BUT I ALSO CERTAINLY IS THE LEGISLATORS WERE DOING THE BUDGET WANT TO BE SURE THAT OUR REGULATORY AGENCIES LIKE THE MEET SEE. DO HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT- THESE POLICIES APPRECIATE THAT'S BEING QUOTE ABSORBS UP LASSEN KNOW YOU'RE READY PRETTYBUSY WE DON'T USUALLY STAFF YOU WITH A LOT OF EXCESS CAPACITY SO- I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT ISSUE TO BE SURE THAT- WE ADDRESS THAT. IF NECESSARY IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN A- COMMENTS FROM- DEPART FINANCE. OKAY THEN I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS TO BE DOING THE CANNELLA SERVICES OVER SECOND KIND OF THE COMMISSION. AND I'M JOINED BY OUR DEPUTY NORMAN EIGHT. ANSWER QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY- FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO BE HERE TODAY AND APPRECIATE ALL THE PROTOCOLS THAT YOU'RE TAKING TO KEEP EVERYBODY SAFE- AND I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO. TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE P. C. P. THAT'S IN THE PACKAGE. FIRST IN TERMS OF THAT. BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE COMMISSION'S WORK. WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT AGENCY THAT WE WORK WITH OUR STATE COUNTY COMMUNITY PARTNERS. TO PROMOTE AND REALIZE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WE HAVE I WOULD SAY FOR VERY BROAD ASPECTS OF OUR WORK THAT INVOLVED DATA. FUNDING INCENTIVES CAPACITY BUILDING AND WORKING TO INFORM POLICY% DECISIONS. ARE DATA WORK SOME SOME OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE DATA MAY BE FAMILIAR WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE IT VERY EASY FOR THE PUBLIC AND POLICY MAKERS. TO UNDERSTAND HOW OUR SYSTEM IS FINANCED. THE KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUPPORTED IN THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE ACHIEVED. OUTCOMES REPORTING IS THE MOST DIFFICULT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. BASED ON SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THIS MORNING AROUND. MONITORING THINGS LIKE- OUR PLANE HEALTHCARE CLAIMS DATABASES. GETTING DATA TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES VERY DIFFICULT. WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS PARTICULARLY. IN IN TERMS OF REDUCTIONS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT THROUGH THE RIGHT. TYPE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT WE CAN DELIVER TO OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. WE PROVIDE. WHAT WE REFER TO AS FUNDING INCENTIVES THROUGH THINGS LIKE OUR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. GRANTS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE B. C. P. THAT'S ON THE AGENDA. WERE WORKING TO BUILD OUT A STRONGER RESPONSE EARLY PSYCHOSIS IN CALIFORNIA RICE'S SERVICES AND SERVICES FOR YOU. WE DO A RANGE OF WORK THAT IS REALLY ABOUT CAPACITY BUILDING HOW CAN WE SUPPORT EFFORTS YOU ARE COUNTING COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO REDUCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. TO STRENGTHEN OUR FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS TO PREVENT PEOPLE LOOK TURNING TOWARDS CRISIS ORIENTED SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'VE GOTTEN EARLY INTERVENTION KINDS OF SUPPORTS FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND WE'RE WORKING TO BUILD AND ESTABLISH LEARNING NETWORKS AND COLLABORATIVE SO THAT OUR SYSTEM IS IMPROVING CONSTANTLY OVER TIME. WE ALSO INFORM POLICY AND PRACTICE THE COMMISSION. LAST YEAR ADOPTED THE SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN WE'RE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THAT NOW WE ARE STRENGTHENING CRISIS RESPONSE STRATEGIES WE'VE GOT THREE PROJECTS UNDER WAY. ON MENTAL HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE WHICH IS AN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE STIGMA STRENGTHEN PREVENTION AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE WE HAVE A PROJECT THAT'S REALLY EXPLORING. THE BOUNDARIES OF PREVENTION WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WITH A STRENGTH IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH PREVENTION EFFORTS AND THEN OF COURSE EVERY STATE OPERA REPORT ON SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. AS PART OF THAT THE COMMISSION HAS RELEASED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN N. IN FUNDING FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH% STUDENT SERVICES ACT AND AS PART OF THE B. C. P. WE'RE ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD THAT OUT AS MENTIONED IN THE B. C. P. THE COMMISSION LAST YEAR RECEIVED JUST OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN APPLICATIONS FOR GRANTS TO SUPPORT SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. AND IT TO BE HONEST IT WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE MORE THAN DOUBLE OF WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED TO BEGIN TO MAKE PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AROUND THE STATE THE FUNDING THE EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS THAT WOULD COVER THE UNFUNDED APPLICATIONS WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW US TO MAKE SOME DOWN PAYMENTS AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTIES SO WE REALLY THINK THIS IS PART OF A LONGER CONVERSATION IN A BROADER STRATEGY TO STRENGTHEN HOW WE DELIVER CARE TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND OUR SCHOOLS SO IT'S A PLACE TO START. AT WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS WORK WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS RESPONSE FROM OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IN BUILDING OUT THESE COLLABORATIVES IT WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO BUILD A LEARNING COLLABORATIVE SO THAT THEY CAN COLLECTIVELY SHARE INFORMATION. IDEALLY WITH SUPPORT FROM THE COMMISSION AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES AROUND FINANCING PROGRAMMING STAFFING CARE DELIVERY AND THE CONNECTION OF SCHOOL BASED CARE WITH COMMUNITY BASED CARE. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN LINK MENTAL HEALTH DATA AND EDUCATION DATA SO WE CAN TRACK THE IMPACT THAT THESE INVESTMENTS ARE HAVING. ON OUTCOMES ASSOCIATE WAS STUDENTS BOTH EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THIS EFFORT AGAIN AS PART OF THIS BROAD PORTFOLIO OF WORK THE COMMISSION HAS IT REALLY DOES LOOK AT DATA. INCENTIVES CAPACITY BUILDING AND STRATEGY AND THAT'S VERY QUICK I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HERE MOST OF THE AFTERNOON SO I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT EITHER A SPECIFIC WORK OR THE ROLE THAT THE MEDICAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT PLAYS. IN A BROAD PORTFOLIO EFFORTS AT THE COMMISSION HAS UNDERWAY. THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORTY SPEAKING TO A TO WITH YOU A LOT MORE AND- BUT I AM ALSO AWARE OF OUR TIME AND I KNOW OUR CALLS. ARE RECALL CAPACITY IS GOING TO STOP BY FIVE SO WE'RE GONNA. GET THROUGH THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WOULD COME BACK AND SPEND A LOT MORE TIME WITH MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A- HUGE AREA OF CONCERN FOR ALL OF US RIGHT NOW AND CERTAINLY A- SPECIAL AREA OF CONCERN FOR ME- THE BATTLE JUST OVERALL WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVER EUROPE YOUR COMMISSION. ARE YOU ARE YOU JUST LOOKING. AB AT THE MONEY TAT COMES IN FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT OR DO YOU ALSO LOOK AT THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALL OTHER WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING OUTCOMES AND SEEING HOW A PERSON IS A- TREATED IN THE SYSTEM. ARE YOU ABLE TO TRACK ALL THE INPUTS THAT COME IN TO THE SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT KIND OF CARE IS REALLY BEING PROVIDED. NOT YET I THINK THAT THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT OUR WORK IS IT SO. NOW SERVICES ACT ACTUALLY INCLUDES A PROVISION THAT SAYS THE PUBLIC THE COMMUNITY SHOULD BE PART OF THE DESIGN OF COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND THAT LANGUAGE IN OUR MINDS REALLY APPLIES TO THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. RIGHT INCLUDING. ACCESS TO CARE THROUGH COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PLANS HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE. THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO CARE IN WAYS THAT IS TIMELY. CULTURALLY LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE. IN THE TOOLS THAT THE STATE HAVE EXTEND BEYOND THE DOLLARS THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. THAT THE POLICY IN THE ACT REALLY ENVISIONS THAT THAT BROUGHT EFFORT TO. ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. CURRENTLY HOWEVER BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS IN OUR ACCESS TO DATA. ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT BOTH REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES WE'RE REALLY ONLY ABLE TO TELL A LIMITED STORY. THAT IS FOCUSED ON THE IMPACT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DOLLARS. AND EVEN THAT STORY IS VERY LIMITED BECAUSE OF. VERY SIGNIFICANT DATA CHALLENGES. BUT IN MANY CASES THE STATE ACTUALLY HAS THE DATA. BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IS PUT IN PLACE THE SYSTEMS AND STRATEGIES TO USE THE DATA SO I MENTIONED. WAYS TO LINK MENTAL HEALTH DATA AND EDUCATION DATA. OUR TEAM HAS DONE AN EFFECTIVE JOB OF LINKING MENTAL HEALTH DATA IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA AND CAN DEMONSTRATE IN SOME INSTANCES. IF THE RIGHT KIND OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CAN HAVE AS MUCH AS A SIXTY NINE PERCENT. REDUCTION IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE WE DELIVER CARE IN A TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE FASHION. SO OUR GOAL OUR INTENT IS TO ANSWER THE BIGGER STORY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SENATOR BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE LIMITED BY CAPACITY AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. AND MOSTLY FOCUSED ON IMAGES SAY. OKAY SO YOU'RE INTERACTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE DO YOU HAVE MUCH INTERACTION WITH THEM AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANAGING COST AND- IN TREATMENT. WHAT HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE MET WITH SAID THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE WE DO INTERACT WITH THEM- WE ARE INCREASINGLY TALKING WITH THEM VERTICALLY THROUGH THIS EFFORT THAT WE HAVE UNDER WAY. WITH THE DEPART WITH THE THIS FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE WE RECOGNIZE THAT EMPLOYERS TO KEEP PARTNERS IN ENSURING ACCESS TO CARE AND THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MEET THESE BROAD STATEWIDE GOALS OF ENSURING THAT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO CARE YOU CAN'T SIMPLY BE THROUGH MEDICARE. OR AM I JUST SAY AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE IS A IS A KEY PARTNER WE'RE STILL LEARNING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S WORK WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THE PARITY LEGISLATION HOW THAT'S IMPLEMENTED. AND WE'RE ALSO TALKING FOR EXAMPLE WITH CALPERS AS A LARGE PURCHASER OF HEALTH CARE ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN LEVERAGE THE STATE'S PURCHASING POWER OR THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR. REALLY SHAPE THE WAY THE MARKET IS DESIGNED AROUND CREATING AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE. AND APPROPRIATE CARE ACROSS THE STATE. SO IF IT JUST AND AGAIN I AM NEW AT THIS I DON'T HAVE THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF- OF DOCTOR PAN BUT- IN IN ESSENCE YOU SERVE AS THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE FOR. PROP SIXTY THREE NINE. WELL THEY SAW THAT THE ORIGINS OF THE COMMISSION ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE FIRST THATTHE MSA REVENUES THAT ARE GENERATED- YOU TO CREATE THAT PUBLIC TRUST THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IN PUBLIC TRUST THESE DOLLARS ARE WELL SPENT I WOULD SAY MORE BROADLY IT'S ALSO TO CREATE THE POLITICAL CAPITAL THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS CARE GETS CARE. IT'S SO. MET QUITE OFTEN THE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE COMMISSION REALLY OVERSEAS DAMAGES A DOLLARS BUT THE LAW IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE COMMISSION IS AN OVERSIGHT AGENCY OVER THE OUR SYSTEMS OF CARE CHILDREN'S SYSTEM OF CARE ADULT SYSTEM IF YOU'RE AN OLDER ADULT SYSTEM A CARE BUT THAT THE COMMITTEE BUT BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE OF PREVENTION. IN THE ACT WHICH IS VERY EXPLICIT BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT RESPONDING TO PEOPLE AFTER THEY HAVE NEEDS IT'S REALLY ABOUT THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY PREVENT THE ONSET OF OR THE ESCALATION OF. FOR SYSTEM L. L. AND BECAUSE OF THAT PREVENTION LANGUAGE WE REALLY SEE THAT AS A WAY IN WHICH WE NEED TO APPROACH THESE CHALLENGES TO A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL. OF REALLY THINKING ABOUT POPULATION BASED STRATEGIES SO IT'S VERY BROAD- OUR PRIMARY ROLE ACTUALLY IS ADVISORY TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE ALTHOUGH IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE GIVEN THE COMMISSION MORE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ALREADY. AROUND THINGS LIKE LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS. WE ISSUE REGULATIONS FOR PREVENTION AND INNOVATION OUR WORK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PREVENTION CAN MEAN AND SHOULD MEAN IN THE MIDDLE HOLE SPACE REALLY COMES OUT OF SOME LEGISLATION FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. THAT ASK THIS QUESTION OF HOW CAN WE BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR PREVENTION EFFORTS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PART OF THAT IS REALLY TRYING TO START WITH WHAT WE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH PREVENTION. AND WE DON'T HAVE BROAD BASED AGREEMENT ON THAT AT THE MOMENT NOT JUST NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIABUT IT BUT YOU KNOW CROSS THE COUNTRY THAT'S AN AREA WHERE- WE REALLY HAVE TO. BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES LOOK LIKE THAT WE CAN SHAPE HOW CALIFORNIA CAN PURSUE THEM. AND IF YOU'RE AN ADVISORY BUT IN SOME RESPECTS OF A REGULATORY WITHOUT ANY KIND OF REGULATORY POWER CORRECT IF I'M WE REGULATIONS FOR P. E. I. N. FOR INNOVATION AND THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS SUCH THAT IF WE IDENTIFY A CHALLENGE WE ARE DIRECTED TO REPORT THAT REPORT THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR- FOR FOLLOW UP THROUGH THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. I THINK YOU HAVE WHAT WE HAVE WORK TO DO OKAY THANK YOU TO WORK TO GET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT'S- IT'S GOOD TO THE- PARTY AND I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY JUST A TOUCH ON TALK ABOUT HISTORICAL IS THAT- AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AT THE INTEREST IN HEARING MORE ABOUT HOW THESE DIFFERENT DIESEL. AND- GREAT- I THINK THAT THAT WOULD AND SO I MEAN WE CAN TAKE TO DO THAT- OFFLINE- JUST THE- THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD WITH AN HSA FUNDING BEFORE AT HAS BEEN IS THAT SOMETIMES SOME OF THE LOCALS THAT SAT ON THE MONEY IN FACT- SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE FOUND OUT THAT- WE DON'T EVEN COLLECT DATA ON HOW. QUICKLY TO MOVING THE MONEY OUT. DESPITE THE DEMAND YOU'LL THINK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS THINGS OUTSIDE SCHOOLS ETCETERA- IS THAT IS THAT PROBLEM BEEN RESOLVED ARE WE GETTING- GOOD DATA FROM COUNTIES ON HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THE MONEY ON A SPENDING THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE GETTING IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND SO I GUESS THAT'S A QUESTION FOR BOTH- DAY OVERSIGHT COMMISSION AND ALSO L. A. L- THANK YOU CENTER PAN- YEAH I APPRECIATE THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE I THINK WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY- BUT YOU KNOW BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT YOU AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAVE RAISED IN THE PAST WE HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT WAYS TO GO. OKAY YEAH.

YEARS IT. I AND- PORTABILITY THE FIRST. IT SHOWED. IT'S CAN. PORTABILITY. FIFTY AND STATE EIGHT INDIVIDUAL IF YOU COULD HOLD ON ONE SECOND I'M KATLEHONG OF CONNECTIVITY PROBLEMS ON OUR SIDE WE'RE NOT JEALOUS PEOPLE FOR FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR ALL. EXCUSE ME THE PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDED ASK FOR INCREASED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR AN INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW LEVEL. WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE SECOND YEAR IF YOU'RE READY FOR ME TO MOVE TO QUESTION TO OUR REGION WE LOST YOU FOR MOST OF THAT AND YOUR WE ARE CURRENTLY FROZEN ON OUR SCREEN AND YOU'RE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH YOUR CONNECTION. WELL. I THINK YOU BY I THINK I'M BACK. OKAY I I'LL REPEAT MYSELF A LITTLE BIT AND TELL ME IF YOU'RE IF YOU HEARD BECOME PARTS. WITHIN AN HOUR OKAY. ALL RIGHT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. CALIFORNIA ENACTED THE FIRST STATE A SUBSIDY PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS OVER LEVEL. WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL SUBSIDIES TODAY. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THAT THREE YEAR PROGRAM AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE AN ENROLLMENT UPDATE IF YOU'RE READY FOR ME O MOVE DOWN TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION ON THE AGENDA. I AM DOCTOR OKAY. GREAT WILL HAVE FINAL NUMBERS TO SHARE IN THE COMING WEEKS BUT THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT OUR MOST RECENT OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD WHICH CLOSE JUST ON SUNDAY ON JANUARY THIRTY FIRST. HAND THREE JANUARY TWELFTH OF THIS YER. WE HAD NEARLY ONE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS I TO RENEW THEIR COVERAGE OR SIGN UP FOR NEW COVERAGE WITH US- THIS NUMBER REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PLAN SELECTIONS OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD LAST YEAR. ABOUT FEDERAL AND STATE FINANCIAL HELP. SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND RECEIVE THE STATE'S SUBSIDIES THAT I MENTIONED AND OF THOSE ABOUT- FORTY FOUR THOUSAND. MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS WITH INCOME BETWEEN POVERTY LEVEL STEEP STATE SUBSIDIES. AN ODD THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED UNDER THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. THAT QUESTION TO A QUESTION THREE- ALSO TALK ABOUT OUR RECENT FEDERAL ACTIONS IN THE FEDERAL A SPECIAL ENROLLMENT EVENT SO I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT NOW UNLESS THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS- SO ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT ESTABLISHED A FEDERAL SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD FOR ALL THE STATES THAT ARE ON THE FEDERALLY FACILITATED MARKETPLACE NOT SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD. I READ. BONZI. TWO FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH THE CALIFORNIA IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FOLLOWED THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE ANNOUNCED OUR OWN SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD FOR ALL CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET I PUTTING THOSE WHO PURCHASED INDIVIDUAL HEALTH COVERAGE OFF EXCHANGE. SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD IT'S GOING NOW IT RUNS FROM FEBRUARY FIRST THROUGH MAY FIFTEENTH OUT WE IN ADDITION COVER CALIFORNIA WILL BE INVESTING AT LEAST SIX MILLION OVER THE COMING MONTHS TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT THE SPECIAL ENROLLMENT EVENT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS. ANYONE WHO NEEDS COVERAGE IS ABLE TO SIGN UP. I WOULD JUST MENTION THAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD THAT WE. OFFERED IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE CODE NINETEEN. INTERNET WE ACTED QUICKLY IN MARCH TO IMPLEMENT THAT RAN THROUGH AUGUST- WE INVESTED ABOUT NINE MILLION IN PUBLIC AWARENESS- TO MAKE SURE THAT. CONSUMERS CAN SIGN UP FOR THAT EVENT AND ALMOST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TO SIGN UP INTO THAT SPECIAL ENROLLMENT EVENT. I THINK THAT WAS A RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS WHO AND THREE ARE THERE ANY ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR ME THERE. THANK YOU. OKAY I QUESTION FOR TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PROPOSED CHANGES TO BE S. FEDERAL PREMIUM TAX CREDIT PROGRAM- THOSE ARE UNDER DEBATE NOW. UNDER THE FEDERAL PROGRAM A FEDERAL PREMIUM SUPPORT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AT BOTH FOR INDIVIDUALS FOR L. PEOPLE TODAY WITH INCOME UNDER LEVEL IT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE CURRENT FEDERAL CUT OFF FOR SUBSIDIES AT FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. SO ANYONE OVER 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL COULD RECEIVE SUBSIDIES. IN EXCHANGE SO THAT PREMIUMS WOULDN'T HAVE TO COST THEM ANY MORE THAN EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME- WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT THIS PROPOSAL DETAILS ARE EMERGING- BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE A SUBSIDY STRUCTURE THAT WOULD BE MORE GENEROUS. THAN THE STATE PROGRAM THAT OUR STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM. AND WE ARE ANALYZING THAT LIFE IS BAD. AND WEBER HELLO WORK WITH THE MANY STRICT ADDITIONAL. ME BE EIGHT EIGHT SUBSIDY CORRUPTION PER US. LESTAT AND TO ANY YOU HAVE. DR PLAN HAS SOME QUESTIONS AND- AND YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME CONNECTIVITY ISSUES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION AND QUESTIONS. YES YES A DOCTOR AND RICHARD PAN- SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO KNOWLEDGE THE- THE AMAZING WORK BEING DONE AT COVERED CALIFORNIA AND- BY HERE AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE FACT IS THAT- IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE HAD AN AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASES UNDER 1% THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE EXCHANGE UNDER ONE PERCENT- USUALLY WE CELEBRATE ANY TIME THE PREMIUM INCREASES LESSEN THE G. P. INCREASE CELL BUT IT'S AGAIN GREAT JOB. I GUESS MIKE- AND MAYBE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO LOOK AT IT SO MAYBE YOU CAN FOLLOW UP ON THIS IS THAT. SOME OF THE CHANGES BEING PROPOSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- WHICH D EXCEED WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO HERE IN STATE BUT YET WE DID TAKE THE FIRST STEP THE STATE AT OUR OWN RISK TO PROVIDE THOSE SUBSIDIES. WOULD PART OF THE REASON WE WERE ABLE TO GET THOSE- COSTS. DOWN SO I DID SO AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT BE VERY INTERESTED AND WHAT THE ANTICIPATED ACTUARIAL IMPACT OF THESE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES. WILL BRING IN BECAUSE AS WE BROADEN THE BASE OF PEOPLE IN THE EXCHANGE- WE- THAT ALSO CAN HELP BRING PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON- DEEP ON PREMIUMS AS WELL- SO- YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN- FOLLOW UP ON. IF THESE THINGS COME TO PASS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- THE IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON THE- RATES EXPECTED FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND HOW THAT WILL AFFECT NEGOTIATIONS COVER CALIFORNIA. HAS AS AN ACTIVE PURCHASER. IT'S A GREAT POINT SENATOR CAN WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT AND LIKE YOU MENTIONED IT WILL DEPEND ON THE LENGTH OF THAT THAT AT. A TIME PERIOD OF THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE ILLEGAL OR DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. OKAY I THINK. SO JUST- SO WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING THE CURRENT SUBSIDIES SO ESSENTIALLY ISRAEL GOVERNMENT CARRIES THROUGH THAT AND WE WOULD. NEED TO DO THAT. CORRECT.
