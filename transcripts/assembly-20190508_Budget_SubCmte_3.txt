THE MORNING JR BLOOM SEVEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JIM DAVIS AND I AM SPECIAL ADVISER TO WRECK TO DIRECTOR BERMAN IT CALTRANS. AND WITH ME IS COURT PAULSON OR DIVISION CHIEF OF BUDGETS. CALTRANS REQUEST AN INCREASE OF EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN FORTY EIGHT FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS FOR PROJECT DELIVERY WORKLOAD. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES INCREASING WORKLOAD TO DELIVER PROJECTS TO MEET SENATE BILL ONE REQUIREMENTS. TOTAL WORKLOAD RESOURCES REQUESTED THE TRADITIONAL 90% STATE STAFF IN 10% ARE. MARKET TEXTURE IN ENGINEERING CONSULTANT RATIO. AFTER AFTER A DECADE OF DECLINING WORKLOAD. PHYSICAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MARK THE FIRST MAJOR INCREASE IN THE CAPITAL IS SUPPORT PROGRAM. DUE TO SB. ONE CALTRANS DEVELOPED AND EXECUTED AN AGGRESSIVE RECRUITMENT PROGRAM TO MEET INCREASING STAFFING NEEDS. BY THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THE COS PROGRAM IS ESTIMATED IT WILL HAVE SUCCESSFULLY HIRED ALMOST FIFTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES TO MEET WORKLOAD DEMANDS. THE TOTAL RESOURCES REQUESTED ALLOW CALTRANS TO PRESERVE AND IMPROVE ON THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTED IN THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION THE STATE'S ECONOMY ENABLING EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE GOODS AND SERVICES. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE CS PROGRAM WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ITS COMMITMENT TO DELIVER PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCTION. AND OVERSEE THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CURRENTLY FUNDED OR PROGRAMMED. OR EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION OR BY ITS OR BY OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. RESOURCES CONTAINED IN THIS REQUEST ARE CRUCIAL COMPONENTS IN THE DELIVERY OF TRANCE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. ENSURE THE CONTINUEDECONOMY. AND LIVABILITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND NOW HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU -- AT THE THE FINANCE LETTER INDICATES THERE WILL BE A FUTURE NEED. FOR MORE -- A COS STAFF FOR A IS THERE AN UNDERLYING CAUSE A A CAUSE FOR THE FIVE ABSOLUTELY SENATE BILL ONE REALLY DOUBLES THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THE SHOP. AND COMMENSURATE WITH THAT FUNDING WILL CONTINUE TO GROW SO WE CAN PLAN DESIGN AND BUILD THOSE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THE CREW THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I KNOW -- LA -- AS COMMENTS MISS PETERS. THANK YOU JUST COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PROPOSAL HERE -- I DO JUST WANT TO POINT OUT IN TERMS OF THE INCREASE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT ITS -- FORTY EIGHT FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS BUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE STAFF POSITIONS AND THIS IS REALLY JUST TAKING DOWN THE AMOUNT OF OVERTIME NOW THAT CALTRANS HAS. HIRED FOLKS IN SORT OF RESTORING OME OF THE HISTORICAL AND PERCENTAGES OF HOW THEY DIVVY UP OUR WORKLOAD AMONGST THE RESOURCES. ARE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THAT WE WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT AND GIVEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY LIKELY TO COME IN WITH. A VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND STOPPING INCREASE IN THE NEXT -- MAYBE A YEAR OR TWO OR THREE AND AFTER THAT -- I BELIEVE IT WAS FIFTEEN HUNDRED POSITIONS THEY'VE HIRED UP THIS YEAR. AND THIS IS SORT OF A PAUSE AND IT GIVES THE LEGISLATURE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW SOME OF THE MANY OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT IN PLACE ARE FUNCTIONING BEFORE AND YOU'RE ASKED TO APPROVE A REQUEST FOR ANOTHER THOUSAND OR TWO THOUSAND POSITIONS. ON IN THE COMING YEARS AND SO SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD RECOMMENDED THAT YOU AND I DROP SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. TO DO SORT OF A LOOK BACK ON A SAMPLE OF PROJECTS TO SAY WHAT WAS THE BUDGET FOR THE PROJECT ESTIMATED TO BE AND WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE WITH THE THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES ASSUMED AGAIN THAT IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET ASSUMPTIONS -- FOR THOSE PROJECTS TO IT TO GET THE LEGISLATURE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND HOPEFULLY COME FOR THAT AND SOME OF THE ESTIMATES IN THE DATA QUALITY HAD IMPROVED. I THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN AND NUMBER OF STEPS INTERNALLY TO IMPROVE THEIR ESTIMATING AND THEIR DATA QUALITY AND RESPONSE TO CONCERNS THAT OUR OFFICE HAD RAISED. AS WELL AS IN RESPONSE TO A TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION -- WORKING GROUP THAT LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE AND FOUND THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT AND HOW PROJECT BUDGETS ARE ESTIMATED AND HOW THE ANNUAL FUNDING REQUEST FITS INTO THAT. AND SO WE THINK CAN NOW THAT YOU HAVE TASK THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WITH DOING THIS PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT -- UNDER SB ONE AS WELL AS PRIOR LEGISLATION THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BENEFIT FROM THAT NEW OVERSIGHT THAT THE CDC IS DOING BY HAVING THEM TAKE A LOOK AT A SAMPLE OF PROJECTS -- AND REPORT BACK TO GIVE THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND HOPEFULLY COMFORT LEVEL IN INFORMATION YOU'LL NEED WHEN YOU'RE ASKED. TO APPROVE AND POTENTIALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE COMING YEARS -- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS GREAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SOUND SOUND ADVICE TO INCLUDE SOME -- REPORTING LANGUAGE GOD DOES THE APARTMENT FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENTS -- NOT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU -- WILL AT THERE'S NO -- ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE AND FOR AFTER ISSUE NUMBER TWO ON I'M SORRY I DIDN'T SEE YOUR HAND GO UP. MS REST. JUST AS A THOUGHT AS THIS AND OTHER OTHER ITEMS OTHER ISSUES -- THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT UP WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW STUFF. I WOULD ONLY ASK THAT WE LOOK AT DIVERSITY -- DEBT AS WE ARE HIRING NEW PEOPLE THAT WE WOULD DO LOOK SERIOUSLY AT DIVERSITY AND I'M NOT SINGLING OUT CALTRANS I THINK THAT'S TRUE FOR ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER THANKS FOR THE COMMENT. AND US WILL MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE. TO THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF AUDITS. AN INVESTIGATION IS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS WILLIAM LEWIS I'M THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OVER THE END HAD OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY JEAN SHEER WHO'S THE CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. SO THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF AUDITS INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION REQUEST LANGUAGE BE ADDED TO THE ROAD. REPAIR AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT PROVIDE SIMILAR PROTECTIONS OF CONFIDENTIALITY. CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY STATUTE TO THE STATE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS. THE ROAD REPAIR AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CHAPTER FIVE STATUTES. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OR WE CALL IT SB ONE CHAPTER IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. FOURTEEN FOR SIXTY ONE VESTED THE OAG WITH FULL AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE ALL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MAINTAINING A FULL SCOPE. INDEPENDENT AND OBJECTIVE AUDIT INVESTIGATIVE PROGRAM HOWEVER. THE SPECIFIED POWERS RESPONSIBILITIES IDENTIFIED IN SB ONE FOR THE AG DID NOT PROVIDE FOR A FULL ACCESS. TO INFORMATION OR FOR THE PROTECTION OF INFORMATION DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL BY LAW. THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION IS TO ENSURE THAT BOTH THE IG AND THE LEGAL DIVISION OF THE STATE TO PUT TRANSPORTATION APARTMENT ARE ABLE TO CONDUCT THEIR INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF COMPROMISING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE PROPOSE HARMONIZING THE AUDIT STATUTES FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR THE OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS AND THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. THIS PROPOSED LANGUAGE IS SIMILAR AND TO THE PROTECTIONS ALREADY STATUARY PROVIDED TO THE STATE AUDITOR AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS. IF CONFIDENTIALITY OF DOCUMENTS CANNOT BE TO PROTECTED IT WILL HAMPER THE O. I. G.'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT COMPLETE AND THOROUGH AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. A LINE IN THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE IS NOT INTENDED TO BROADEN THE AUTHORITY THE ORGY BUT TO AVOID POTENTIAL CONFUSION BETWEEN VARIOUS. STATE AUDIT STATUTES. THE STATUTES REFERENCED IN SB ONE PERTAIN TO THE OTHER RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INTERNAL AUDIT ORGANIZATION. AS SUCH THAT ALL THE PROGRAM WOULD BE AFFORDED THE CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS OF THAT DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER BECAUSE SB ONE SPECIFICALLY CREATED THE ID TO BE AN INDEPENDENT OF THE DEPARTMENT. THE INTERNAL AUDITING STATUTES IN SB ONE ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO THE EXISTING INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. AND THEREFORE THE PROTECTIONS OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS IS NOT PROVIDED. A COMMON UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO AND WHICH ARE EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE WOULD BENEFIT BOTH THE IG AND THE DEPARTMENT'S LEGAL COUNSEL. BY AVOIDING CONFUSION THE O. I. G. AND THE DEPARTMENT CAN FOCUS MORE ON RESOURCES AT THEIR CORE MISSIONS. RATHER THAN ON DISCLOSURE DISPUTES. AND FINALLY PROMOTING PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IS A CORE VALUE OF THE IG AND THE DEPARTMENT. SO THEREFORE THE PURPOSE OF THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY CAN CONTINUE. WITHOUT COMPROMISING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. WITHOUT THE ASSURANCE OF CONFIDENTIALITY HE IG IS UNABLE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OBTAINED. FROM THE DEPARTMENT NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE RESPONSIBILITIES OUTLINED IN SB. ONE WE'RE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU -- SO I THINK THAT THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION MIGHT BEEN BURIED AND THAN THAT -- STATEMENT THAT YOU JUST GAVE -- BUT THE QUESTIONS RAISED WHY -- THE IG NEEDS MORE PUBLIC RECORDS AUTHORITY THAN THE STATE AUDITOR. CURRENTLY HOUSE SO REALLY WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO HAVE ANY MORE AUTHORITY WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE STATE AUDITOR'S STATUTE AND ALSO THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES OFFICE OF STATE AND EVALUATIONS AND REALLY TRY TO TAKE. FROM THERE THE SIMILAR TYPE -- LANGUAGE THAT WE USE IN THIS TRAILER BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE PROVIDED THE ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE RECORDS. AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO GET MAINTAIN THAT LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT. WE WILL NOT ONLY WE DON'T FEEL THAT MORE AUTHORITY YEAH WE DON'T FEEL THAT THIS TRAILER BILL AS PROVIDING ANYMORE AUTHORITY LEAST IT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT IT -- IN FACT A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I DON'T KNOW HOW -- TO RESULTS THAT TOWARDS THE PINYIN A LOT AND WE'RE HEARING THAT THEY'RE THIS THIS MORNING THAT THAT -- SOMETHING THAT I THINK -- OUGHT TO BE EXPLORED MORE SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THE THERE'S HARMONY BETWEEN -- A THE STATE HONOR AND AND AND THE AUTHORITY THAT TO AND WE'RE MORE HAPPY WE'VE DONE I'LL -- SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS AND WE'RE VERY MORE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOUR STAFF AND BE ABLE. TO SHARE CHAU WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN OF COURSE THE LARGER QUESTION -- IS -- WHETHER OR NOT THIS -- ISN'T BETTER -- DEALT WITH IN A POLICY COMMITTEE SINCE IT DOES. NOT APPEAR -- TO OF FACILITATE -- NEW POLICY -- BUT I THINK THAT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT LA -- AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCEWANT TO ADD SOME COMMENTS SO -- BUT I'LL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THAT ISSUE AND TELL US WHY YOU THINK -- IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE HERE AS OPPOSED TO A POLICY COMMITTEE IMMEDIATELY AFTER BIRTH -- THE OTHER COMMENTS JUST BRIEFLY WE WOULDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE TRAILER BILL. LANGUAGE -- OBVIOUSLY WITH A DEPARTMENT AS LARGEST CALTRANS HAVING AND YOU KNOW WELL FUNCTIONING OVERSIGHT SYSTEMS IN PLACE IS A GOOD THING. I'M YOUR STAFF HAS NOTED AS YOU ALREADY INDICATED MISTER CHAIR AND THAT THIS MIGHT BE A BETTER FIT TO GO THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS IF YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- HOW THE AUTHORITY FOR CALTRANS A LINES IN MEASURES UP WITH OTHER SIMILAR THIRTIES IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS I'M CERTAINLY THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS WOULD BE ABLE TO THAT THOSE THINGS AND PROVIDE DOT COM -- FOR BUT IT'S TOTALLY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE LEGISLATURE READY WANT TO PURSUE THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IN THE POLICY PROCESS. THANK YOU. YOU HAVE COME. HERE THE NEWMAN ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT WHETHER THIS MOVES TO THE POLICY PROCESS OF THE TRAILER BILL PROCESS THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION. IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LANGUAGE -- THAT WAS ULTIMATELY INCLUDING STATUTE MEETS THE GOALS THAT I MISTER LEWIS JUST OUTLINED IN ITS PRESENTATION. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU FOR THAT -- SO -- POLICY OR BUDGET. WELL THE READ ONE WAY IN ON THAT YEAH THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE WHEN WE SAW THAT WEAKNESS OR THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH THE HAVING THAT CONFIDENTIALITY. STATUTES WE FELT SOONER WAS BETTER AND THAT'S YOU KNOW CERTAIN WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS AND TAKE -- AFFORD THAT ACTION BUT WHAT YOU WILL BE SEEN AS SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR COMING THROUGH THAT POLICY -- PROCESS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CLARIFIED YOUR RESPONSE BUT IT I KNOW WHEN -- YOU MEAN ORTEGA -- FOR ME THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH GINGER THEY TALKED ABOUT THAT WITH THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES AND THIS WAS JUST. THE JEWS OPPORTUNITY WE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY BRING SOMETHING BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE AND SHARE WITH THEM THE CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT WHAT LANGUAGE IS IN THE SB. ONE SET YOUR NOW AND THEN JUST TO ADD TO THAT -- WE ARE CURRENTLY [inaudible] EXPERIENCING OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES IN THIS REGARD -- IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A SPECULATIVE IN THE FUTURE PROBLEM IT IT ACTUALLY EXISTS NOW AND SO THAT'S WHY WE THOUGHT ARENA THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY TO GO DOWN THIS PATH I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT REALLY A FISCAL ISSUE. BUT BY HAVING IT -- BE PART OF A TRAILER BILL SUCH AS THIS -- WE'D BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE THE INTERNAL CONFLICTS THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AS REYES. MISTER CHAIR I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED MY THINK THAT. IT DOES APPEAR SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE -- MORE APPROPRIATE IN POLICY TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE FOR THE DISCUSSION ON IT. OTHER EXAMPLES I KNOW THAT THE COMMENT WAS THAT IT'S NEEDED NOW. OTHER EXAMPLES OF WHERE. THE ABSENCE OF THIS HAS CAUSED PROBLEMS. SO IN A NORMAL SITUATION YES TO ANSWER YOUR CANS QUESTION YES I CAN GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES IN THE NORMAL SITUATION WHEN THE STATE AUDITOR'S REACH OUT TO CALTRANS AND WOULD LIKE TO GET INFORMATION AS PART OF AN AUDIT THAT THEY HAVE GOING ON WE ARE ABLE TO FREELY. SHARE THAT WITH THEM -- WITHOUT WAIVING ANY PRIVILEGES FOR EXAMPLE I'VE BEEN ASKED IN THE PAST -- BY THE STATE AUDITOR'S FOR INFORMATION THAT'S ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION PRIVILEGED AND SO IS VERY HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL BUT I'M ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S AS PART OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO AN AUDIT. CURRENTLY WE HAVE SEVERAL INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT LEGAL IS INVOLVED WITH I'M UNABLE TO AUTHORIZED MY ATTORNEYS TO SHARE ANY INFORMATION WITH THE IG. BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD WAIVE THE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE THERE AND IN THERE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THEY'RE AN INDEPENDENT I MEAN THEY'RE SITTING IN CALTRANS. THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED UNDER SB. ONE WHAT USED TO BE OUR INTERNAL. AUDITING PROGRAM IS NO LONGER INTERNAL THEIR NEXT THEY'RE AN EXTERNAL THEIR INDEPENDENT THEY HAVE INDEPENDENT RESPONSIBILITIES TO REPORT. OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THEREFORE WERE I TO AUTHORIZE ANY OF OUR ATTORNEYS TO RELEASE INFORMATION. TO ASSIST THE O. I. G. N. ONGOING AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS I WOULD BE BREACHING THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE -- AND THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM. SO [inaudible] RESTAURANT -- YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR ANSWER THAT -- THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL IS WITHIN THE AGENCY AND THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL -- EFFORTS TO CREATE A EXTERNAL AND INSPECTOR GENERAL OUTSIDE THE AGENCY TO OVERSEE A WHICH I THINK THE LA ACCOUNTABILITY. TO HOW DOES THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL CURRENTLY OPERATE WITHIN THE CAL IT WITHIN CALTRANS IS IT. INDEPENDENT TRULY YES IT ABSOLUTELY IS SO THERE ARE NO OTHER FOR ANY CLIENT PRIVILEGE WITH THEM WHATSOEVER -- THEY DON'T SEEK LEGAL ADVICE FROM US FOR EXAMPLE -- THEY ARE AND ALL IT BILL SPEAK TO IT BUT THEY ARE INDEPENDENT. AS OTHERS ARE THERE SPECIFIC FIRE LAWS THAT EXIST THAT THE CREATED WITHIN WITHIN WITHIN YOUR OPERATION TO ENSURE THE INDEPENDENCE. WELL THERE'S FIRE WALLS TO ENSURE THE CONFIDENTIALITY -- WE DON'T SHARE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WITH THEM CURRENTLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM THAT THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY AND AS FAR AS THE ALL AS FAR AS THE AUDIT FUNCTION YES WE AND ALSO HONOR INVESTIGATION FUNCTION WE ARE INDEPENDENT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE WHAT WE OUGHT. WE NO LONGER HAVE THE DEPARTMENT -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENT CAN ADVISE US AND SHARE WITH US THE CONCERNS THEY MAY HAVE. WE CAN USE AS WE DEVELOP OUR RISK ASSESSMENT AND THEN. THERE ARE OTHER PLAN BUT NO LONGER DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THE DID DEPARTMENT I DIRECTOR SIGNING OFF ON A LOT OF MY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH THEM GET INFORMATION. BUT THE AYE AYE INDEPENDENT OFFICE ABOUT ITS INVESTIGATIONS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF AN INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS FULL AUTONOMY DID AUDIT WHAT THE BILL IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THAT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT CALLOUSED -- AND ALSO TO THE PUBLIC. IF I COULD ASK DELEO CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT IN TERMS OF THE BEST PRACTICES OF OF WHETHER AN EXTERNAL AN INSPECTOR GENERAL IS PREFERENTIAL TO ONE AS WITHIN AN AGENCY -- BUT WE CAN FOLLOWUP WITH YOU ON MORE OF THAT BUT I THINK HE JUST SPEAKING GENERALLY AND IN ORDER FOR THAT IT'S AN INSPECTOR GENERAL OR REALLY ANY SORT OF OVERSIGHT AND TWO T. -- AS I THINK AS LONG AS IT'S STRUCTURED IN A WAY WHERE YOU HAVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND THE INFORMATION THAT IS COMING OUT IS. AND YOU KNOW HELPING TO IDENTIFY ISSUES AND AND GIVING THAT SORT OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS THAT IT CAN BE STRUCTURED -- WENT WHEN AN ENITY IS COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT AND YOU CAN CERTAINLY MAKE IT CLEANER MAY BE EASIER TO SEE AND LINES OF OF ON INDEPENDENCE. BUT AS LONG AS IT'S STRUCTURED IN SUCH A WAY WHERE YOU HAVE -- CHECKS AND BALANCES AND ITS FUNCTIONING AND THE OVERSIGHT ENTITY IS ABLE TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE PUBLIC ON ON WHAT ITS FINDINGS ARE THERE THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN STRUCTURE IT. LOOKING AT OTHER INSPECTOR GENERAL'S IN OTHER AGENCIES HOW ARE OTHER AGENCIES STRUCTURE. I'M WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE AND WITH SOME SOME MORE INFORMATION AND BEST PRACTICES IF YOU COULD PROVIDE -- SOME INFORMATION IN TERMS OF OTHER INSPECTOR GENERAL'S IN AND WHICH ONES ARE EXTERNAL AND WHICH ONES. IT IS OUR HOUSE WITHIN THE AGENCY I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US TO SEE WHAT THE BEST STRUCTURE WOULD BE. APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. IF THERE'S NO -- FOR THE QUESTIONS WE'LL HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC ON ISSUES ONE AND TWO AND THEN WE CAN PROCEED TO A VOTE -- TO I'LL LET YOU KNOW JUST AS THE IF THIS MIGHT HELP INFORM THE REMAINDER THE DISCUSSION WHAT I'M THINKING IS -- RATHER THAN -- FOLLOWING THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO REJECT THAT WE HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN -- WITH THE DIRECTION -- TO COMMITTEE STAFF AND TO THE OFFICE -- TO TRY TO WORK TOGETHER -- TO HARMONIZE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE -- BEEN BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEE IF WE CAN DO THAT OF I CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FROM. OF FROM BOTH PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST I THINK I'M BEGINNING -- TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND AND TO I COULD SEE I COULD SEE BOTH SIDES OF IT SO GIVING A LITTLE BIT. MORE TIME AGO FOR THIS WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE LA -- TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO US. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE BAKER WITH THEIR AND RE DISSOCIATES FOR THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. WE'D LIKE TO SUPPORT THE VERY MODEST -- CAPITAL OUTLAY SUPPORT INCREASE OF FORTY EIGHT POSITIONS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. WE WANTED TO COMMEND THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE OUTSTANDING JOB THAT THEY DID ON HIRING AND THE LAST YEAR -- WHEN THIS COMMITTEE MET LAST YEAR I THINK THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONCERN BY BOTH THE? COMMITTEE THE STAFF AND AND US THAT THEY WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTIES REACHING THOSE HIRING LEVELS AND THEY REALLY HAVE -- IN CREATIVE AND HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB MEETING THE HIRING GOALS THAT YOU ALL SETS WE WANTED TO THANK HIM FOR THAT. ALSO JUST ON ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES COMMENTS ON DIVERSITY -- THE DEPARTMENTS ALSO DONE A VERY GOOD JOB HIRING A VERY DIVERSE. GROUP OF ENGINEERS OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT IS A FEMALE OUR PAST PRESIDENT WAS A FEMALE IS A FEMALE -- WE'VE HAD LEGISLATORS OF COME TO OUR MEETINGS AND SAID IT LOOKS LIKE GOING TO A YOU AND MEETING IN. SO AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT HAS A GOOD JOB AND SHOULD BE COMMENDED ON BOTH THOSE THINGS THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND THAT APPEARS TO BE THE ONLY A SPEAKER ON THESE TWO ITEMS -- IS THERE -- CONSENSUS AROUND TO HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN WITH THE DIRECTION -- TO WORK AS A PREVIOUSLY INDICATED EVERY OKAY WITH THAT RIGHT THEN THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO HOLD THE ITEM OPEN -- SEE YOU AGAIN IN A FEW WEEKS. WE'RE NOW MOVING ON TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY -- AND ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. WELCOME SURE BROUGHT MY REPORT WITH ME. GOOD MORNING CAN FOLLOW ALONG. MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SET MY NAME'S BRIAN ANISE -- I'VE RECENTLY BEEN APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME AS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AT HIGH SPEED RAIL. ABBOTT PENNY MY START DATE THERE I COME TO YOU TODAY IS THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION -- I'M ALSO JOINED ON MY LEFT HERE BY RUSSELL FONG WHO'S THE CURRENT CFO AT HIGH SPEED RAIL AND HE'S MOVING OVER TO THE CFO. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO HELPFULLY THEIR EXPANSION AND IN HOUSING ACTIVITIES THEY'RE GOING TO DO OVER THERE -- THE TWENTY NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT WAS RELEASED ON MAY FIRST AND RECONFIRMS GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S APPROACH TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. A VERSION THE FIRST LAID OUT IN THE STATE OF THE STATE IN FEBRUARY THAT VISION GETS HIGH SPEED TRAINS ON THE GROUND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE LIVES WITHIN OUR FISCAL MEANS AND REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE VISION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL CONNECTING THE BAY AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT ADDRESSES STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORTING ELEMENTS SUCH AS UPDATES ON COST ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RISKS. ADDITIONALLY THIS YEAR'S PER OR PROJECT UPDATE REPORT INCLUDES INFORMATION THE AUTHORITY COMMITTED TO PROVIDE AT THE TIME OF LAST YEAR'S BUSINESS PLAN. FIRST THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLANET INDICATED A FUNDING GAP FOR THE VALLEY TO VALLEY SEGMENT. THAT WAS THE COST OF TIMELY AND PACHECO PASS FROM YOUR EYE TO MADERA. AT THE AUTHORITY INDICATED THE TWENTY NINETEEN PROJECT UP THEY WERE POOR WOULD INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF EARLY HIGH SPEED SERVICE -- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SAN FRANCISCO SEGMENT. THAT ANALYSIS INDICATES THE BEST SEGMENT FOR EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICE IS THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. THAT SEGMENT WOULD DECREASE TRIP TIMES BY NINETY TWO HUNDRED MINUTES AND ABOUT DOUBLE RAIL RIDERSHIP ACROSS THE ACE SAN JOAQUIN AND NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE [inaudible] SECOND. A TRAIN OPERATOR REVIEWED THE CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES AND PERFORMED A BENCHMARKING EXERCISE FOCUSED ON CAST COST CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT LOCATION DEPENDENT SUCH AS TUNNELS. VIADUCTS AND BRIDGES. AND COMPARED THAT TO COST EXPERIENCE IN GERMANY WHICH IS WHERE THEY DETAILS FROM. AT THAT ANALYSIS SUGGESTED SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR COST SAVINGS WHICH WILL BE FURTHER EXPLORED DURING PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING AND FINAL DESIGN PHASES. LASTLY THE AUTHORITY COMPLETED A MORE RIGOROUS RISK EVALUATION AND MADE UPDATES TO CENTRAL VALLEY COST ESTIMATES. THESE ESTIMATES INCREASE THE CONTINGENCY FROM ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. AND INCLUDED SOME SCOPE INCREASES. AB THREE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MILLION AND COST INCREASES FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION. THESE. INCLUDE. ITEMS SUCH AS INTRUSION BARRIERS LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AND TRACKS AND SYSTEMS. THIS PROJECT UP THE REPORT FOCUSES THE EXISTING FUNDING RESOURCES THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED TO GET A SECTION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL UP AND RUNNING. THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY OF THE BROADER PROJECT. SPECIFICALLY THE REPORT PROPOSES BUILDING THE FRESNO SHE'S ME MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD LYING. A BUILDING BLOCK PROJECT THAT MATCHES THE AVAILABLE FUNDING WE HAVE BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION WE HAVE TODAY. AT THE SAME TIME THE PROJECT UP THE REPORT MAINTAINS EXISTING COMMITMENTS TO BOOK AN PROJECTS. AND COMPLETION OF ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS ON THE ENTIRE SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM SIX SECTION. WHEN THESE INITIAL INVESTMENTS ARE COMPLETE THE STATE WILL HAVE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN UPGRADING RAIL IN THE STATE? CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION IN THE BAY AREA ON A FIFTY MILE SEGMENT INITIALLY USED BY CALTRAIN BUT LATER I SHARED WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL THIS INVESTMENT INCREASES SPEEDS CAPACITY IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY. CENTRAL VALLEY HIGH SPEED RAIL EARLY INTERNS SERVICE ON A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILES. MAKING THE MAJOR SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN CITIES OF OUR SAID FRESNO BAKERSFIELD GETTING HIGH SPEED TRAINS OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. IN ACHIEVING SUBSTANTIAL MOBILITY ECONOMIC AND AIR QUALITY BENEFITS. LOS ANGELES UNION STATION RUN THROUGH TRACKS IN ROSECRANS MARK OR GRADE SEPARATION. INCREASING SPEEDS IN CAPACITY THROUGH LOS ANGELES INITIALLY BENEFITING METROLINK CAM SURFLINER AMTRAK. BUT LATER SHARED WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. TO GOVERNOR NEWSOME REMAIN SUPPORTIVE OF THE VALLEY TO VALLEY VISION OF HIGH SPEED GROUND BELIEVES THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUILDING BLOCK. IS A TANGIBLE FIRST STEP TO REALIZING THAT VISION. TO MAKE THE FALL SAN FRANCISCO TO LA LA ANAHEIM SYSTEM A REALITY WE FIRST NEED TO BUILD A WORKING SEGMENT. TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH SPEED RAIL TO CALIFORNIANS. THIS PROJECT UP THE REPORT ALSO FULLY EMBRACES THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS FROM THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN NOT IT. CLEANING SIGNIFICANT TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT REFORMS. INSPIRATION IS ALREADY MADE THE PROJECT MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE. BY POSTING CHANGE ORDERS ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WEBSITE. ADDITIONALLY THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT INCLUDES THIS THOROUGH DISCUSSION OF RISK INCLUDING RISK RELATED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. CAN YOU GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW. YOU -- WHAT WHAT THE PARAMETERS WERE THAT WERE USED -- AFTER THE EARLY OPERATOR -- OPTIONS SURE. WELL THIS WAS BASED OFF THE THE CALL IN THE TWENTY EIGHT BUSINESS PLAN TO LOOK AT THE VALLEY TO VALLEY SEGMENT REALIZING THE CURRENT FUNDING WASN'T SUFFICIENT TO FULLY BUILT VALLEY TO VALLEY. WITH THAT GAP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THE TUNNEL SUPER JACO SO THE ET -- FOCUSED BOTH ON THE SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY SEGMENT. AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT. AND LOOKED AT WHAT THE BENEFITS WOULD BE OF HAVING A HIGH SPEED OPERATION ON THOSE SEGMENTS AND OF COURSE IN THE BAY AREA -- YOU HAVE THE CALTRAIN SERVICE THAT WOULD BE RUNNING -- ON THOSE SAME -- ALIGNMENTS IN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEYRECOGNIZING THE ACE AND THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE -- LA -- DID YOU WANNA MAKE SOME COMMENTS LATER HAILING CHRISTY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SIX MAJOR ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION -- PRELIMINARILY I'M SO BROUGH BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THOSE FOR YOU THAT'S ACCESSIBLE YES -- SO AS WAS INDICATED BY THE AUTHORITY. THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT REFOCUSES THE PROJECT IT REFOCUSES IT ON A SEGMENT BETWEEN MERCED IN BAKERSFIELD. THIS IS BASED IN PART BY THIS ANALYSIS THAT THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR -- WE WOULD KNOW HOWEVER THAT THE THAT ANALYSIS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SOME THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THAT REALLY TRAIN OPERATOR MADE IN TERMS OF HOW THIS. US SERVICE WOULD INTEGRATE WITH EXISTING OTHER SERVICES INCLUDING A SEND AN AMTRAK AS WELL AS THE CUSTOM CAPITAL PROJECT THAT WE NEED TO OCCUR I FOR EXAMPLE HAVING SHARED STATION AT MERCED WHICH IS NOT I AM CURRENTLY -- I SO CERTAINLY -- SHOULD THESE ASSUMPTIONS NOT MATERIALIZE THAT COULD AFFECT BOTH THE RIDERSHP AND REVENUE PROJECTIONS THAT ARE ASSUME. THE SECOND ISSUE WANTED TO FLAG IS THAT WE BELIEVE THE ACTUAL COST OF THE PROJECT COULD POTENTIALLY BE HIGHER THAN ARE ESTIMATED. I'M PART OF THIS IS JUST INTRINSIC TO ANY LARGE MAKE UP PROJECT WHICH IS OF COURSE -- SUBJECT IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY I THIS PROJECT ALSO HAS SOME UNIQUE RISKS INCLUDING REGARDING SCHEDULING -- WHICH COULD INCREASE COSTS -- FOR THE MORE WE JUST WANTED TO ALSO HIGH LATE -- AN ASPECT OF THE FORTIES ASSUMPTIONS FOR HOW IT HAS COME TO ITS ITS ESTIMATE SO IT'S INDICATED THAT -- IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PLAN IT'S AT THE BASELINE BUDGET SUCH THAT THERE'S A 10% CHANCE THAT -- THAT BASICALLY THE THE PROJECT WILL COME IN AT OR BELOW THAT BASELINE BUDGET -- IT'S NOT REVISED THAT APPROACH TO TO BASICALLY ASSUME A 70% CHANCE THAT THE PROJECT WILL COME IN AT OR BELOW THAT COST ESTIMATE BUT ONLY FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. WE HAVEN'T RE LOOKED AT THE ENTIRE PROJECT COST AND WE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU DID THAT FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT YOU PROBABLY END UP WITH THAT A HIGHER COST ESTIMATE AND THAT IS REFLECTED FOR THE ENTIRE. WHO HELPED HOW COULD YOU DO THAT IF YOU DON'T KNOW -- AT THIS POINT THE THE ROCK HASN'T BEEN DETERMINED SO. SO THEY DO HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY YEAH THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION THEY THEY HAVE SOME -- COST ESTIMATES THAT THEY PUT TOGETHER FOR PHASE ONE IN PREVIOUS BUSINESS PLANS OF FOR EXAMPLE -- THAT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. IDENTIFIED ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF A TOTAL COSTS THAT WAS ASSUMING A ROUTE -- THAT WOULD YOU THE ROUTE THAT SORT OF BEEN DISCUSSED I CERTAINLY THEIR REFINING THAT THE SPECIFICS OF IT BUT I THINK THE GENERAL ROUTE HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW HAS BEEN -- LAID OUT SUCH THAT THEY FELT COMFORTABLE THAT THEY COULD IDENTIFY THAT PROJECT COST -- CERTAINLY THERE'S MORE -- THERE'S A GREATER RANGE OF POTENTIAL COSTS -- FOR THOSE ASPECT THAT HAVEN'T BEEN BEEN PRECISELY NAIL DOWN TO THOSE SEGMENTS THAT -- THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT EXACTLY THAT PICKED THE CORRIDOR ARE SUBJECT MORE UNCERTAINTY BUT THEY WERE STILL ABLE TO PROVIDE A RANGE AND AT A POINT ESTIMATE. BUT THE POINT ESTIMATE I THINK OUR OUR POINT IS THE POINT ESTIMATE WAS SAT ON IT. USING A LESS CONSERVATIVE METHODOLOGY THAN THEY'RE USING NOW FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD AND IF THEY APPLIED THAT MORE CONSERVATIVE METHODOLOGY TO THE ENTIRE COST ESTIMATE. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST AS IT WOULD BE HIGHER THAN THAN NOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS AT SEVENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THERE'S AT A ROUGHLY TWO BILLION DOLLAR COST. THAT THAT THE US 70% -- ESTIMATE ABOVE OR BELOW IS. KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A OF A LARGE NUMBER -- IT. IT IT'S A IT'S IT COULD BE 70% HIGHER 70% LOWER OR IS A 70% CHANCE THAT IT COULD BE HIGHER. OR LOWER OR IS THAT SKEWED TO IN ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE. YES TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE WAY THEY DID IT BEFORE THEY BASICALLY -- DID A SIMULATION A MODELING EXERCISE TO LOOK AT SORT OF WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THE COST ESTIMATES WOULD WOULD. BE IT WOULD FALLING DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS BASICALLY AND PREVIOUSLY THEY TOOK THAT SORT OF I'M GONNA DISTRIBUTION AT THAT LEVEL OF LITTLE BIT OF TECHNICAL. KIND OF EXERCISE BUT AND THEY BASICALLY SET THE POINT ESTIMATE -- ASSUMING THAT ESSENTIALLY -- THERE'S ONLY A 10% CHANCE THEY WOULD STAY WITHIN THAT THAT BUDGET THAT'S PRETTY LOW I MEAN WHEN THERE'S A 90% CHANCE ARE GONNA GO OVER BUDGET RIGHT. AND THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A PRETTY THAT'S NOT A VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE SO THEY'VE INDICATED THAT NOW BASED ON BEST PRACTICES THE REVISING THAT ASSUMPTION AND NOW THEY'RE TAKING A MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH -- AND TAKING A 70% SO NOW THEY'RE ASSUMING -- A CONTINGENCY SUCH THAT THERE'S A BELOW THAT COST ESTIMATE. THAT SEEMS VERY REASONABLE TO US. MISS HURT YEAH I KNOW IT'S AT OR% BACK OR BELOW SO NOW THEY'RE DOING 70% AT OR BELOW THAT COST AFTER I I NEED MAY HAVE NOT MADE THAT CLEAR I APOLOGIZE BUT THAT'S A MUCH. THAT DOES SEEM LIKE A MUCH PREFERABLE KIND OF ASSUMPTION IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN THAN THE 10% APPROACH -- BUT WE WOULD AND WE WOULD KNOW THAT THEY ONLY APPLY THAT METHODOLOGY. TO MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD NOT TO THE ENTIRE PROJECT SO IF YOU DIDN'T IF YOU HAD APPLIED THAT METHODOLOGY TO THE ENTIRE PROJECT. I YOU WOULD LIKE WE HAVE A HIGHER COST ESTIMATES WOULD I BE CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT'S BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT -- AS AS WE SIT HERE NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROJECT THAT -- TO AS IT MOVES FORWARD INTO THOSE OTHER AREAS IS FAR LESS PREDICTABLE -- FORCE AS HERS SITTING HERE NOW SO YEAH I AND I BILL EIGHTY TO KIND OF USE THAT THAT MORE CONSERVATIVE NUMBER. OF APPLIES HERE BUT IT. WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO APPLY TO THE LONGER TERM -- YET THEY DO HAVE THEY DO HAVE A RATIONAL WITHIN THE BUSINESS AND I THINK IT'S SOME ALONG THOSE LINES AND THEY CAN PROBABLY SPEAK TO THAT IN MORE DETAIL. HOWEVER I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD ARGUE THAT ACTUALLY YOU MIGHT WANT TO I THINK HOW THAT CONSERVATIVE APPROACH FOR THOSE VERY AND CERTAIN AREAS AS WELL -- BECAUSE THERE'S I MEAN YES YOU CAN HAVE A LARGER RANGE IN TERMS OF YOUR YOUR POSSIBLE COST BUT IN TERMS OF SETTING YOUR POINT ESTIMATE FOR BUDGETING PURPOSES. WE STILL BELIEVE THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO SET THAT SUCH THAT THERE'S A RELATIVELY SMALL CHANCE TO GO OVER THAT BUDGET BECAUSE WHEN YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANNA -- WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE REALISTIC IN SETTING THAT BUDGET A SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HAS A SENSE OF WHAT IS COMMITTING. TO SO I I THINK I INTERRUPTED TELL YEAH. AS FOR THAT BUT BEFORE YOU MOVE ON WHEN -- LA WAS COMPLETED -- HER REMARKS MR ANAS MAYBE YOU CAN RESPOND TO THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN APPLY A MORE CONSERVATIVE -- APPROACH TO COST -- AT ESTIMATES FOR THE FUTURE SEGMENTS. SO AT THE I APOLOGIZE -- IT SO THE THIRD MAJOR ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO FLAG FOR FOLKS IS THAT WE BELIEVE IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THEY'LL BE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETE THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT -- AND PARTLY THAT'S BECAUSE OF THIS COST UNCERTAINTY CERTAINLY COSTS COULD BE HIGHER IT'S ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ON THE REVENUE SIDE AS WELL -- AS WAS MENTIONED -- THERE'S A THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE IS AWARE OF THIS THAT -- THAT THE PROJECT HAS RECEIVED HOWEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- HAS THREATENS TO RESCIND THESE DOLLARS AND SHOULD THAT OCCUR -- THAT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PROJECT TO BE FULLY FUNDED -- ADDITIONALLY THERE'S ALWAYS SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH CAP AND TRADE REVENUES AS THE AS THE COMMITTEE IS IS AWARE AND I'M SO WE THINK THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS ON THE CABIN TRADE REVENUES ARE REASONABLE BUT BUT SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTIES WE WANTED TO FLAG THAT FOR FOLKS AS WELL -- CERTAINLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE FUNDS DON'T MATERIALIZE OUR COSTS ARE HIGHER THE GENERAL FUND -- OTHER FUNDING SOURCES COULD BE REQUIRED -- FOURTH WE WANTED TO FIGHT THAT THERE'S NO FUNDING PLAN BEYOND MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD AT THIS POINT SO ON TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO GO BEYOND THAT SEGMENT AND WANTED TO EXTEND AND YOU ALL ABOUT IT VALLEY OR DO ALL OF PHASE ONE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WOULD BE. REQUIRED -- LIKELY FROM THE GENERAL FUND -- AT LEAST AND IN WHOLE OR IN PART -- FIFTH -- WE DID WANT TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR MOVING FORWARD SO WE CONTINUE TO THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS WHAT IT'S PRIORITIES ARE AND HOW IT WANTS TO APPROACH THE PROJECT. ON THIS IS THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A SHIFT IN APPROACH FOR THE AUTHORITY AND ALSO JUST GIVEN GIVEN THIS FUNDING GAP AND GIVEN. SORT OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS FACING THE LEGISLATURE WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD CHANCE TO SERVE STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT -- WHAT AT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO DO IN TERMS OF ITS -- IT'S PRIORITIES FOR THIS PROJECT I THEY SAID THERE ARE THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE OPTION BUT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD COMMIT FOR EXAMPLE TO A SHORTER SEGMENT JUST DOING FOR EXAMPLE THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT. COULD DO A LONGER SEGMENT -- IT COULD IT COULD FOCUS ON HIGH SPEED SERVICE AS IS PROPOSED IN THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT OR IT COULD -- HAVE SOME KIND OF EITHER IN AROUND OUR LONGER TERM SERVICE THAT WOULD BE. LESS HIGH SPEED IT UP POTENTIALLY OR COULD EVEN USE CONVENTIONAL DIESEL A SERVICE THERE VARIETY OF OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO LEGISLATURE -- WE THINK THAT THEY SHOULD ALL BE CONSIDERED AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD EVALUATE THEM -- AND THEN FINALLY WE DO LAY OUT SOME POTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS AS AS LEGISLATURE EVALUATE THOSE OPTIONS ALL JUST VERY QUICKLY. BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THEM ONE IS COST -- TO THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT IS NOW ESTIMATED TO COST TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION THAT'S UP BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION FROM PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. ON THE EXTENSIONS TO MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD IN TOTAL ARE ESTIMATED TO COST ABOUT FOUR BILLION MORE. THE SECOND CONSIDERATION IS TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS SO WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO WANT TO WEIGH THE TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS THEM ACCESSIBILITY MOBILITY BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH A DIFFERENT OPTIONS AGAINST THEIR COSTS. SO FOR EXAMPLE THOSE EXTENSIONS YOU DO THOSE PROVIDE FOR BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BENEFITS -- AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT THE CHOICE FACING THE LEGISLATURE. I'M ALSO WE WE RECOMMEND CONSIDERING EFFECTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUT IN TERMS OF CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS -- AND AND DISRUPTIONS AS WELL AS ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT CAN BE PROVIDED -- AND THEN ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE ARE -- THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA WANNA CONSIDERED ANY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPTIONS THAT AGENDA DOES A REALLY NICE JOB OF OUTLINING A NUMBER OF THOSE -- YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE INVOLVED COST INCREASES COORDINATION WITH OTHER ENTITIES WE BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON THOSE AS WELL AS A POTENTIAL ISSUES RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION ONE A REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL FUNDS -- SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU AB STRATEGY WANNA TAKE A CRACK AT ANSWERING THAT EARLIER QUESTION SURE SURE. AND THE ISLAND IT UP TO QUESTIONS FROM FROM THEM THAT WAS A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THAT THE CHANGE IN THAT AND PROBABILITIES AND RISK AND SO FORTH AND THAT. GENERALLY THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT DOES NOT INCLUDE AT REEVALUATION OF ALL PROJECT CASA TYPICALLY IS THAT BUSINESS PLANS THAT ARE DONE IN THE EVEN NUMBERED YEARS. SO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BE WORKING ON UPDATED ESTIMATES FOR THE AT TWENTY TWENTY A BUSINESS PLAN. AND CERTAINLY BRING SOME OF THESE THESE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY INTO THAT -- INTO THAT RE ESTIMATION OF THAT THE BROADER PHASE ONE COST. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU A MISS PATTERSON AND YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP FOLLOWED BY MISS RIVAS. AND MISTER PHONE. THANK YOU. LET ME START WITH PAGE A FIFTEEN OUR FOR THE FIRST TIME IT IS NOW APPARENT IN YOUR OWN. PLAN THAT THEY HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL REQUIRE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SUBSIDY. AND THAT'S ON PAGE. FIFTEEN I WANT TO READ TO YOU. STREETS AND HIGHWAYS CODE SECTION TWO SEVEN OH FOUR POINT. OH EIGHT THE AUTHORITY CANNOT SPEND THIS IS A SUMMARY THAT CANNOT SPEND BOND FUNDS. UNTIL IT OBTAINS A CERTIFICATION FROM INDEPENDENT FIRM THAT THE SERVICE WILL NOT REQUIRE A SUBSIDY. THE LANGUAGE IS PROUD TO COMMITMENT BY PROCEEDS OF THE BOND AND THEIR SEVERAL STORY SHALL HAVE PROVIDED. AND GOES ON TO SPECIFICALLY OUTLINED PRECISELY. WHAT HAS TO BE? CONCLUDED A REPORT REPORTS PREPARED BY -- INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL FIRMS IT'S AFTER. AND I CAN I DRIVE YOUR ATTENTION -- TO THE SECTION NO SUB HEADED. D. AND I'M QUOTING. THE PLANNED PASSENGER. TRAIN SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITY. OR PURSUANT TO ITS AUTHORITY WILL NOT REQUIRE OPERATING SUBSIDY. HAVE YOU NOT JUST DISQUALIFIED YOURSELF FROM PROP ONE A FUNDS. NO SIR A FEAR LOOK AT THAT PROP ONE EIGHTY AND THE REQUIREMENTS -- AROUND THAT IN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- WHEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT -- SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT AS WITH THE FEDERAL GRANT ALWAYS ENVISIONED THIS IDEA OF INTERIM SERVICER INTERIM USE OF THAT FACILITY. AS AS BEEN PLANS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON RUNNING TRAINS ON THAT SEGMENT -- IF THERE'S SAY ANY GAP BETWEEN YOU KNOW HAVING THAT SEGMENT BUILT OUT. AND AND ADD LONGER HAVE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE SO -- WITH LOOKED AT THAT SERVICE WITH THE IDEA THAT OTHER OPERATORS -- WOULD BE USING THE FACILITY IN THE INTERIM BEFORE YOU HAVE THAT LONGER HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT THAT WOULD BE OPERATED. DIRECTLY BY HIGH SPEED RAIL -- CONSISTENT WITH THAT REQUIREMENT -- LEGALLY -- IT'S SIMILAR TO THE CALTRAIN EXAMPLE IN THE BAY AREA -- THERE WITH THE BOOK AND FINDS ABOUT SAYS SIX HUNDRED MILLION A PROP ONE A FUNDS -- HAVE GONE OR ARE GOING TO THAT -- SEGMENT OF CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION THAT WOULD BE -- USED INITIALLY BY CALTRAIN -- CALTRAIN RECEIVES OPERATING SUBSIDIES TO RUN THAT SERVICE -- LATER ON HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL WILL BE ON THAT SEGMENT AS WELL AS A SHARED SEGMENT -- THERE WAS MENTION ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS A A BILL BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MALL AND AB -- EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE THAT -- CLARIFIED AS SOME OF THOSE PROVISIONS AROUND INVESTMENT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDS THAT SERVE -- OTHER PASSENGER RAIL OPERATORS AND THEIR INVESTMENTS THAT ARE USEFUL FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL -- WHEN HIGH SPEED RAIL EVENTUALLY GETS TO THOSE SEGMENTS -- BUT IN THE INTERIM IT'S APPROPRIATE WITH BOND PROCEEDS TO HAVE THOSE EARLY INVESTMENTS IN THE CORRIDOR. AGAIN I'M I'M SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO OPERATIONAL SUBSIDY. AND THE EXPRESS LANGUAGE IN THE BOND. WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS THAT YOU WILL ESSENTIALLY OFF LOAD TO AMTRAK FOR EXAMPLE IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA? AND THEREFORE AMTRAK WILL HAVE TO ABSORB -- THE THE SUBSIDY. BUT THE LANGUAGE IS IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE SERVICE. PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITY OR PURSUANT TO YOUR AUTHORITY. THE HAND THAT OFF. TO ANOTHER AGENCY THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE. TAX PAYER AND AND CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. SUBSIDY WILL NOT REQUIRE OPERATING SUBSIDY -- TO ME THAT LANGUAGE IS IS IS IS VERY CLEAR AND I I THINK THAT -- THIS. I THINK PUTS AT RISK. AND I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY. DISCOVERED THAT -- THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL NOW NEW. INFORMATION [inaudible] THAT FUELS. THE ONGOING LITIGATION AND LAWSUIT OVER THE PROP ONE A FUNDS. WHAT I SUGGEST IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY VERY HARD TIME? OFF LOADING THAT -- TO AMTRAK OR SOME OTHER OPERATOR BECAUSE IT IT IT'S IT'S STILL PURSUANT TO YOUR AUTHORITY. YOUR YOU ARE CREATING A SYSTEM. INITIALLY OPERATED WITH A SUBSIDY WHICH I THINK IS EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN [inaudible] BUT IT IS CLEAR YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON THAT AND MY GUESS IS THAT THIS WILL AGAIN FEED -- LITIGATION -- I WANT -- TO WHAT TALK ABOUT [inaudible] UP. I WOULD I WAS REALLY STUNNED. WHEN I WATCH AN NBC BAY AREA INVESTIGATIVE [inaudible] JOURNALISM [inaudible] REPORT. I WANT TO QUOTE -- JOE HEDGES THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER. NBC BAY AREA STORY ON APRIL TWENTY NINTH. SAYS I CAN'T SPEAK FOR YESTERDAY I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING. REPORTER ASKS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE DOING IN DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY MRHEDGES SAYS WE'RE GOING TO SEE INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE WITH PRANK PLANE. RAIL. ON TOP OF THAT [inaudible] THE NBC. REPORTER -- FOLLOW THAT UP -- AND THEN MISTER HEDGES CLARIFIED. WHAT WE CALL PLANE RAIL? SIMPLE RAIL THAT IS BASICALLY CAPABLE OF RUNNING A TRAIN ON IT. THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION FROM NBC NOT A HIGH SPEED TRAIN. QUOTE NO. PROBABLY NOT. END OF QUOTE. ON TOP OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF HIGH SPEED. CONCRETE. YOU PLAN TO PUT. SLOW SPEED RAIL. AND YOU'RE CALLING THAT AN INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT. NO THAT AND THAT THE QUOTE FROM. THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WAS WAS MISINTERPRETED SO. WHAT SAID WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GRANT IS TO LAY DOWN THE TRACK WORK AND THAT WAS WHAT IS BEING REFERRED TO SO BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO END OF? TWENTY TWENTY TWO REQUIREMENT. TO LAY DOWN THE TRACK LATER THE PROJECT WAS EXPANDED WHEN WE DID THE FUNDING PLAN AND AT LAKE TWENTY SIXTEEN EARLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR THAT ONE A BONDS TO INCLUDE ELECTRIFICATION. OF THAT -- HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT SO IT THAT'S THE DISTINCTION I BELIEVE THAT WAS BEING REFERRED TO YOU HAVE. BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO PUTTING DOWN THE TRACK BUT THAT TRACK IS FULLY SUITABLE FOR HIGH SPEED TRAINS. THAT TRACK WON'T CHANGE WHAT WILL BE ADDED THEN AS PART OF THE THAT. LATER PHASES THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THAT WITHOUT THE ELECTRIFICATION IT DOESN'T WORK FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL TRUE OR NOT. WHAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE WE'RE IT'S PART OF THE COST IT'S PART OF THE THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IS THE ELECTRIFICATION THERE AGAIN THE THE CONCERN I AM RAISING HERE IS CENTRAL CALIFORNIA? HAS BEEN THE BEGINNING PIG IN ALL OF THIS AND WE HAVE HAD THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF PRIME AG. TORN UP WE HAVE -- LOTS OF OUR STREETS AND ROADS AT THAT TORN UP. WE HAVE THESE CONCRETE MONUMENTS TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND YET. BY THIS. ADMITTANCE BY THE PLAN IN FRONT OF US. YOU'RE GONNA PUT PLAIN RAIL UP THERE AND YOU'RE GONNA RUN SLOW SPEED FOR WHAT A DECADE OR MORE. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT IS IS TO BUILD THE HIGH SPEED RAIL -- CAPABLE SYSTEM AND THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT INDICATES THAT -- YOU'D HAVE SERVICE RUNNING FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD HIGH SPEED SERVICE -- BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND THEN THE EXTENSION NUMBER SAID BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN THAT. THAT. IS PREDICATED UPON YOUR ABILITY. TO GET THE NECESSARY FUNDS INCLUDING SUBSTANTIAL. AMOUNTS OF FUNDS. UP. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- I WANT. TO DRAW YOUR TENSION AGAIN TO THE NBC BAY AREA MAY. THIRD STORY THESE ARE QUOTES DIRECTLY OUT OF THE STORE THIS IS. SOME VERY GOOD INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM AND I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT. WE BASICALLY GET -- ACCURACY FROM. THE MEDIA AND FROM OUR AUDITOR WE RARELY GET ACCURACY FROM THIS AUTHORITY. AT THE PRESENT RATE OF CONSTRUCTION HIGH SPEED RAIL CANNOT MAKE THE FEDERAL DEADLINE USE THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE STORY. HIGH SPEED RAIL NEEDS TO BE SPENDING A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH TO REACH THE TARGET DEADLINE. AND THEY SAY AS OF MAY THIRD YOU ONLY HIT THAT TARGET ONCE. AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WAS CONSTRUCTING THREE TIMES SLOWER THAN THE NECESSARY. PACE. AND WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING WAS IN THIS STORY ACCORDING TO THREE HSR OFFICIALS WHO DID NOT WANT TO BE QUOTED FOR FEAR. OF RETRIBUTION THAT THEY'LL MISS. AND THAT THE DEADLINE BY YEARS [inaudible] YOU YOU. SO I THINK I NOT ONLY ARE YOU I THINK YOU'RE RISKING THE PROP ONE A BUT I THINK YOU'RE RISKING THE FEDERAL. MONEY AND I THINK GIVEN THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE PLANNED. IS. VERY ALMOST -- ANNUALLY OR BIANNUALLY -- I THINK YOU'RE RUNNING INTO VERY SERIOUS -- CREDIBILITY PROBLEMS WITH -- WITH THE FEDERAL. THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK. I DON'T I THINK THAT. ANYBODY THAT LOOKS AT WHAT IS BEFORE US HAS TO HAVE A REAL GRAY RESERVATIONS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MEET THESE KIND OF DEADLINES. WHEN WE LOOK BACKWARDS YOU'VE NEVER MET DEADLINES OF COST -- BUT BEFORE NEVER MET DEADLINES OF COMPLETION. BEFORE WHY SHOULD WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU CAN THE DEADLINE. COMPLETIONS THAT PUT IF YOU DON'T MEET THEM WILL PUT AT RISK BILLIONS OF A FEDERAL DOLLARS. BUT THE THE SCHEDULE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS A IS A CHALLENGING SCHEDULE BUT THE PROJECT ON THE GROUND AND SOME OF THE RISK AND THE INFORMATION THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORTS SHOW HOW WERE ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S MUCH MORE GRANULAR AS THE PROJECT GOES FURTHER ALONG -- TO THERE'S IN YOUR AGENDA FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON RIGHT AWAY ACQUISITION AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO. THERE'S YOU SEE THAT THE NUMBER A SHRINKING -- RIGHT AWAY IS. NEARING COMPLETION -- THE STRUCTURES -- YOU LOOK AT THEM ONE BY ONE AND THERE'S A LOT OF GRADE SEPARATIONS -- THERE'S GRADING WORK AT BETWEEN THOSE GRADE SEPARATIONS SO AGAIN -- THE PROJECTS ADVANCING WITH THE WORK BEING DONE WITH AT NEW. TEAM COMING AND THE CEO ALL OTHERS REALLY LOOKING AT MUCH MORE GRANULAR ISSUES WITH EACH SECTION EACH STRUCTURE. ADDRESSING THOSE AND AGAIN GETTING THOSE TO CONSTRUCTION AS YOU SAY IS IS KEY AND THAT'S HOW WE THINK OVER THE NEXT PERIOD. REBUILD THAT CREDIBILITY IS SHOWING THOSE STRUCTURES GETTING UNDER CONSTRUCTION SHOWING THE STRUCTURES GETTING COMPLETED. YOU ARE PRESENTLY I UNDERSTAND UNDER -- FEDERAL AUDIT. BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. MUCH OF THIS. CONCERN WAS RAISED. WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. AND IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S CONCLUSIONS AND REPORT -- HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS AT GRAVE RISK. OF CLAWBACK. THIS HAD TO DO WITH THE EARLY SPENDING -- LETTING OUT CONTRACTS WHEN THE AUTHORITY KNEW PRECISELY THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PROPERTY UPON WHICH TO DO THE CONSTRUCTION. LOTS OF DELAYS AND AND THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED THOSE WITHOUT FUNDAMENTAL REASONS FOR THE EARLY -- DELAYS -- YOU ARE UNDER AUDIT ALRIGHT. THAT HAVE YOU HAD REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTATION ARE YOU BEING. A FOURTH RIGHT AND TRANSPARENT WITH -- THIS AUDIT I NOTICE IN. YOUR REPORT THAT. YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS RADIO SILENCE AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- DOES THAT NOT INDICATE TO YOU THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS ONGOING EFFORT HERE. TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIGH SPEED RAIL AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SHOULD BE CLAWED BACK BECAUSE OF THE PAST PERFORMANCE AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS GOING TO MISS. OUT ON DEADLINE. ARE YOU AWARE OF THE AUDIT AND ARE YOU PARTICIPATING IN DOCUMENT REQUESTS OR INFORMATION YEAH. SO WE ARE WHERE RESPONDER OUTGOING CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WE ARE WE ARE THAT TO THAT FOR A IS ACTUALLY BEING AUDITED FROM THEIR SIDE AND PART OF THAT AUDIT IS LOOKING AT HIGH SPEED RAIL INVOICES -- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT PERFORMANCE -- IT WHAT I CAN SAYS WE WE ARE HAD NOT TOUGH STRETCH RIGHT NOW ON OUR PERFORMANCES BELOW WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. WHEN WE WENT TO THE BOARD BACK IN JUNE TO ASK FOR A BUDGET OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR -- WE DID HI LIKE THAT IT WAS A VERY AGGRESSIVE BUDGET AND A VERY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE -- WITHOUT BEING SAID WHAT GOING TO SURE YOU IS THAT WE DO REPORT TO THE BOARD OF FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE EVERY MONTH ON OUR PROGRESS AND THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY. PROBABLY COME FROM OUR BOARD REPORTS OF OUR PROGRESS SO WE ARE MONITORING OUR PROGRESS ON A MONTHLY BASIS WE DO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE THAT WE BELIEVE. WILL GET US BACK ON TRACK BUT IT IS IT AN AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE. ONE FIVE MISTER CHAIRMAN ABOUT -- CONTINGENCY PLAN A PLAN B.. SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE AND SENSE I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE I'VE ASKED REPEATEDLY WHAT IS YOUR PLAN B.. IT IS APPARENT THAT [inaudible] THE PLAN. ENVISIONED IS NO LONGER THE PLAN. AND IN FACT I'VE SUGGESTED THAT. THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU SCALE DOWN CHOPPED UP CHANGED MOVED AROUND THIS ENTIRE. OPERATION IS IS THAT IT'S NOT THIS IS IN THE BUSINESS PLAN THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A GOING OUT OF BUSINESS PLAN. IT DEMONSTRATES THE UNRAVELING IN MY JUDGMENT BECAUSE OF THE RISK FACTORS AND AND AND PREVIOUS HISTORY. AND SO I WANT TO REFER TO THE AUDITOR. CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR TO ENSURE THAT IT IS ADEQUATELY PREPARED. IF IT IS ON ABLE TO MEET THE FEDERAL GRANT DEADLINE OF DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE AUTHORITY SHOULD BY MAY TWENTY NINETEEN DEVELOP A CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR RESPONDING TO SUCH A SCENARIO. THIS WAS THE AUTHORITIES RESPONSE. THE AUTHORITY CONCURS WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION I GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM [inaudible] APLICA PARAGRAPH. AND WE WILL PREPARE A CONTINGENCY PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CSA. RECOMMENDATION. PLANNED COMPLETION DATE MAY. TWENTY NINETEEN I SEE NO. PLAN B. IN. THIS REPORT. WHAT ON EARTH IS YOUR CONTINGENCY PLAN? YOU HAVE RIPPED UP CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF PRIME AG LAND THAT IS NO LONGER IN USE. ON TOP OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF HIGH SPEED CONTRACT YOU BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION ARE LAYING DOWN. PLAIN RAIL. AND AND THE RESULT OF THIS IS THAT [inaudible] CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- IS EXPERIENCING UP OF REAL LET DOWN IN A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AND WHAT WAS PROMISED. AND WHAT IS PERFORMED. AND WHAT WE SEE. IS THIS PLAN ESSENTIALLY ESTABLISHES WHAT AMOUNTS TO A SLOW SPEED. ROCK RAIL ROAD BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD AND MADERA AND I THINK IT'S QUESTIONABLE WHETHER YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO GET IT. TO MERCED SO WHAT ON EARTH. DON'T DONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT YOU WAKE UP SAYING OH MY GOD THIS THING HAS REAL PROBLEMS. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IF? EVERYBODY THAT DOES ANY KIND OF LARGE SCALE PROJECTS LIKE THIS HAVE CONTINGENCY PLANS. WHERE IS YOUR PLAN B.? YOU WERE ASKED. BY THE AUDITOR TO PROVIDE. ONE THE AUTHORITY COMMITTED TO PROVIDING IT. MAY OF THIS YEAR. HERE WE HAVE LOTS OF PAGES COLOUR PRETTY LOTS OF LANGUAGE. WHAT'S MISSING ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE AUDIT THAT YOU COMMITTED [inaudible] TO PRODUCE. IF I COULD ANSWER A COUPLE WAYS FIRST AT THE TIME LINE FOR THAT IS THE SIX MONTH AUTO REPLY WHICH IS -- COMING UP IN A FEW WEEKS YEAH. I WOULD MENTION AS FAR AGAIN ON ON THE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREEING WITH YOU ON WHAT IS PROPOSED FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY AGAIN. WHAT'S PROPOSED FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL -- THE THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT AS AN ELECTRIFIED SEGMENT. IF LESS IS IS ULTIMATELY BUILT OUT -- THERE ARE CERTAINLY EVEN IN THE GRANT AGREEMENT -- THERE'S CONTINGENCIES FOR CUT OVER RAIL TO AMTRAK AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT WHAT. IS PROPOSED HERE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY CONSISTENT WITH PROP ONE NAY IS TO BUILD HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE OPTIMAL% USE OF THE FUNDS WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO COMPLETE THE BEST A HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH THE FUNDING AVAILABLE AND AGAIN. BELIEVE THAT SAY. HIGH QUALITY HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILES SO WE STAND BESIDE SO YOU ARE YOU ARE -- ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT. JOE HEDGES AND HIS COMMENTS ON THE PUBLIC RECORD IN AN INVESTIGATIVE. STORY THAT SAID YOU PUT IN PLAIN RAIL UP THERE AND KNOW WHAT PROBABLY WILL NOT BE HIGH SPEED. KNOW WHO'S TELLING US THE TRUTH. WHAT WHAT IS BEING BUILT IS IS HIGH SPEED RAIL AGAIN IT'S GETS TO THE PHASING? THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TIMELINE DOESN'T REQUIRE THE ELECTRIFICATION THEY CAN'T MERRY'S BE BUILT ON THAT SCHEDULE. BUT THOSE ARE PART OF THE FUNDING PLAN AND THAT IS WHAT IS PROPOSED IS TO BUILD ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL. DO YOU HAVE IT ARE YOU PLANNING TO BUY ANY HIGH SPEED EQUIPMENT OR ARE ARE DOES THAT WAIT. UNTIL SUNDAY DECK MAYBE A DECADE FROM NOW YOU HAVE THE MONEY. TO MAKE PLAIN RAIL HIGH SPEED. WHAT'S WHAT'S GONNA RUN ON THIS THING. WHEN YOU? OPEN IT UP AND CALL THAT AN INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT. ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES OF HIGH SPED RAIL AND WHEN YOU PUT PLAIN TRACK ON IT AND THERE'S A EIGHT NINE TEN YEAR WINDOW. WHERE WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE THAT YOU ELECTRIFY IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME AS MISTER PATTERSON AND IF YOU MISTER AND IF YOU MISSED THE DEADLINE YOU HAVE FUND ISSUES WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT A QUEUE YOU'RE ASKING QUESTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN -- ANSWER BUT IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE A A RELATIVE ZERO THAT'S MISTER JENNER AND THINK THE ANSWERS OF THAT ACT. AND YOU AND THEY ARE AT FINAL QUESTION THE PLAN DOES INCLUDE FUNDING FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS. AND A MAINTENANCE FACILITY FOR THOSE TRAINS [inaudible] AS RIVAS -- CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN AGAIN EXACTLY HOW THIS PROJECT UPDATE -- CAME UP WITH TOTAL FUNDING AVAILABLE OF WHAT TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION YEAH. SO IN THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN WE HAD RANGES OF WHAT FUNDING COMMENT MAINLY DUE TO THE FLUCTUATION OF CAP AND TRADE EVERY YEAR. SO IN THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT WE REALLY FOCUSED ON TWO SCENARIOS -- WE HAVE A LOS SCENARIO WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT BASICALLY SCENARIO SAYING THAT CAP AND TRADE WILL COME IN AT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- WE HAVE A HIGH SCENARIO THAT ASSUMES THAT CAP AND TRADE WILL COME IN AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WHICH BRINGS THAT UP TO TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS -- ANYWHERE WITHIN THAT RANGE WE FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED THE WERE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD -- BUT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT CAP AND TRADE COMES AND WE DO MONITOR THAT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS -- I CAN TELL YOU AS OF TODAY OUR ACTUAL DOLLARS -- WERE ACTUALLY COME IN HIGHER THAN WHAT OUR HIGHEST PROJECTIONS ARE WE SHOULD BE AT ABOUT NINE POINT SEVEN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WILL ROUTE TODAY -- SO CAPTURE IT IS ACTUALLY COMING IN A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN A HIGH ASSESSMENT. HOWEVER WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT AND WE DO MONITOR THAT QUARTERLY EVERY TIME AN OPTION COMES IN YEAH -- OKAY THINKS AND CAN NOW KEEP PLEASE WALK ME THROUGH HOW YOU DETERMINE. OF THE ANTICIPATED AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT YOU EXPECT TO BE AVAILABLE TO COMPLETE. THE ENTRANCE SEGMENT. SURE SO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WERE VERY AWARE OF WE HAVE THE PROPER NAY NINE BILLION DOLLARS JUST ABOUT FOUR POINT TWO BILLION THAT. WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO OF THAT NINE BILLION. AND THEN THE REST IS CAP AND TRADE THE OPTIONS THAT COME IN EVERY QUARTER. SO PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF OUR FUNDING IS WE HAVE THE PROBLEM A FUNDS OF AGAIN NINE BILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE THE FEDERAL FUNDS OF THREE POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION. BUT THAT THE CHALLENGES THE CAP AND TRADE BECAUSE THAT COMES IN ON A QUARTERLY BASIS -- AND WE CAN'T REALLY PREDICT WHAT THAT WHAT THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT IS NOW WHAT I CAN SAY IS WE DO TRACK IT VERY CAREFULLY. AND IT'S ACTUALLY COMING IN HIGHER THAN WHAT OUR HIGHEST PROJECTIONS ARE. SO IT IS A FORECAST ARE FUNDING AND AND IT IS SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING. THANK YOU -- I SAID MAKE A COMMENT THAT I THINK IT'S JUST CONVENIENT THAT THE COST OF THIS. PROPOSED INTERIM SEGMENT IS PRECISELY EQUAL TO THEM AN AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT YOU EXPECT TO HAVE AVAILABLE. TO TWENTY THIRTY IT'S NOT TAKING ANY. OF COST OVERRUNS INTO ACCOUNT OR YOU KNOW THE PROPERTIES HAVE NOT BEEN PURCHASED WRITER THE RIGHT OF WAYS HAVEN'T BEEN. SECURED IS THAT CORRECT SIR SO THAT IS PART OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED ABOUT ARE CONTINUOUSLY AND I GET TO TECHNICAL ON OUR OUR SEVENTY P. SEVEN IN A P. TEN BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT A PIECE OF INDIA'S WE HAVE A 70% CHANCE OF BEING ACCURATE ON OUR BUDGET. A 30% CHANCE OF NOT BEING ACCURATE -- THE WAY WE GOT TO OUR BUDGET IS TO ADD ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OF CONTINGENCY -- WHAT THE WAY I LOOK AT THAT IS IT'S IT'S MONEY SET ASIDE FOR THOSE REST THAT WE NOW WE HAVE MEDICATIONS FOR BUT IT MIGHT NOT WORK? OR EVEN THOSE UNKNOWN REST THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF BUT THAT'S A BIG PART THAT'S YOU KNOW THE 70% VALLEY. ABOUT 9% OF THAT IS JUST ADDITIONAL CONTINGENCY FUNDS TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS THAT WE'RE AWARE OF OR THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF KATE. SO. I REPRESENT THE THIRTY NINTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH WHICH THE THE SEGMENTS THE SOUTHERN SEGMENT OF THE RAIL THE ORIGINAL VISION -- WERE TO GO THROUGH -- AND SO CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THIS PROPOSAL BENEFITS DISTRICTS LIKE MINE OR ANYTHING SOUTH. OF BAKERSFIELD [inaudible] SURE. WHAT THE F.? IF THIS IS. THE STRUCTURE OF STATEWIDE RAIL INVESTMENT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL ALONE BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY AREAS WERE HIGH SPEED RAIL WON'T. REACH THE I WON'T YOU KNOW GET TO THOSE CITIES SO FAR HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE IDEA OF A STATEWIDE RAIL MODERNIZATION APPROACH. AND THAT'S BEEN REFLECTED IN IN SEVERAL WAYS AND SEVERAL NEW FUNDING PROGRAMS OF COURSE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM OF TWENTY FOURTEEN A SET UP A NEW FUNDING PROGRAM. IN SB ONE AUGMENTED THAT AS WELL SO WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT STATE FUNDING SOURCES PRIMARILY THE CAP AND TRADE IN SB ONE WITH ALONG WITH A LITTLE HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT'S THE BOOK IN MONEY. I SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RAIL INVESTMENTS ARE ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS -- THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THIS PAST PERIOD DOES SINCE -- TWENTY FOURTEEN AND IN THAT INCLUDES SAY AGAIN BUT SOME OF THE NEW SB ONE MONEY THAT STILL COMING IN BUT THOSE ARE AWARDED PROJECTS TO IMPROVE METROLINK -- SURFLINER ALL THOSE RAIL SERVICES AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY SERVICE AND MANY TRAVELERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL ALSO CHOOSE TO USE THE EXISTING BUS CONNECTION TO GET DOWN TO LOS ANGELES AS WELL. SO SOME OF THE TRAVELER'S COMING TO AND FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WOULD CHOOSE TO USE. THE CENTRAL VALLEY RAIL AS THEY DO TODAY BUT IT MUCH EXPANDED NUMBERS -- GIVE A PROJECTION ON HOW. THOSE EXPANDED NUMBERS LAKE YES THAT'S HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH DOES THIS REDUCE THE TRIP TIME SURE CAN ALSO DOES DOES THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE WRITING RAIL TODAY THAT TO PASS THROUGH OR WITHIN THAT BAKERSFIELD MERCED SEGMENT WOULD SAVE NINETY TO A HUNDRED MINUTES? OF TRIP TIME -- ANDY AT THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ARE IN THE THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR REPORT WHICH IS ON HIGH SPEED RAILS WEBSITE BUT AT THE TIME HIGH LEVEL WHAT ABOUT. DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS LOOKING ACROSS THE THREE SERVICES. THE EIGHT THE ALTAMONT COMMUTER EXPRESS THE SAN JOAQUIN'S WILL BE OPERATING AS HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THEN THOSE BUS CONNECTIONS FROM BAKERSFIELD TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT WITH THE BUS CONNECTIONS ARE THEY REALLY SAVING NINETY TWO HUNDRED MINUTES. WELL AGAIN FOR THOSE EXISTING PASSENGERS THAT WOULD START IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WANT TO TAKE A A RAIL TRIP TO SAY SACRAMENTO -- CURRENTLY THERE'S DICKEY GO THE COASTAL RAIL ROUTE AND THAT. TAKES A THINK ABOUT ELEVEN HOURS TO GET TO HAVE FROM MY LOS ANGELES UP TO SACRAMENTO SLIGHTLY SHORTER IF YOU TAKE THE BUS CONNECTION FROM LA TO BAKERSFIELD AND GET AND GET ON THE TRAIN AT BAKERSFIELD TO GO TO SACRAMENTO. SO THAT THAT THAT PARTICULAR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRAVELER WOULD SEE AN INCREASE. OR DECREASE RATHER IN TRIP TIME BY THAT NINETY TWO HUNDRED MINUTES. YOU KNOW I NOTICED THAT YOUR PROJECT UPDATE -- HAD NO ALTERNATIVES PROPOSED OF MEA THE ONLY OPTION THAT YOUR PRESENT TEAM. IS THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD YOU KNOW AS A LEGISLATOR I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN VARIOUS OPTIONS LIKE. THE LA -- MENTIONED -- THIS IS NOW. OF SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO CONSIDER -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN MORE OPTIONS IN EUROPE. PROJECT UPDATE SURE APPRECIATE THAT YET THE GIVEN THE THE FRAMING IT WAS COMMITMENTS MADE AT THE TIME OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN TO LOOK AT THAT VALLEY TO VALLEY AND LOOK AT THE BUILD OUT ON EITHER END OF VALLEY TO VALLEY AND HOW WE COULD DO THAT IN. A ROOM SERVICE GET THROUGH OUR BROADER RAIL MODERNIZATION EFFORTS WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA -- THERE WAS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED FOR THE CALL THIS THE SCORE PROJECT THAT METROLINX LOOKING AT FOR HOW TO UPGRADE A NUMBER OF LINES INCREASE FREQUENCY TO SOMETHING LIKE EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES ON SOME OF THE MOST TRAVELED LINES DOWN THERE. SO THERE IS WORK BEING DONE ON ON THOSE TYPE OF IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL AND AGAIN IT'S THEY'RE NOT DEPENDENT ON HIGH SPEED RAIL -- COMING INTO THOSE CORRIDORS BUT THEIR MUTUAL BENEFIT PROJECTS THAT -- AT THE THE L. UNION STATION THE ROSECRANS MARQUARDT WINDOWS FREE OUT MORE GRADE SEPARATED SEGMENTS IN SOME CASES ALLOW FOR MORE CONTINUOUS THIRD TRACK. OF THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT IMPROVE THE EXISTING RAIL SERVICES TODAY. ARE YOU KNOW. THERE IS NO PROPOSED STOP IN MY DISTRICT YOU KNOW THE THE THE RAIL -- JUST GOES RIGHT THROUGH IT -- AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE -- MY CONSTITUENTS WOULD EVEN BE ABLE TO AFFORD -- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL -- IF IT THERE WERE A STOP IN THE DISTRICT -- IN SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF WHEN I SEE THIS PROJECT -- I THINK OF OF WHETHER. YOU KNOW PEOPLE YOU KNOW MY MY DISTRICT IS MMHM -- PRIMARILY LOW INCOME -- YOU KNOW THE HOUSE CURRENTLY NO TRANSIT CORRIDORS VERY LITTLE -- IN MOST PEOPLE. ONE TRANSIT WITHIN THIS THE AREA THE WITHIN THE REGION YOU KNOW TO GET TO WORK YOU KNOW TO THIS AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE -- AND BUT A PROJECT LIKE THIS -- WOULD DISRUPT -- YOU DON'T THEIR LIVES BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW YET -- YOU KNOW WHERE WHAT HOMES WILL YOU KNOW WHICH FAMILIES WILL BE DISPLACED IN IN THE DISTRICT. OF IN SO. THAT'S WHERE. A YOU KNOW MY CONCERNS ARE -- JUST FOR THE OVERALL VISION OF THE PROJECT -- BUT AS FAR AS THIS SEGMENT GOES -- I AM ALSO CONCERNED -- THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT TWITCH I THINK THIS PROJECT IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON NOT JUST IN. THE FUNDING OR YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A FUNDING SOURCE -- BUT THE NEED FOR REVIEWS THAT YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR UPDATE ORIGINALLY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CONDUCTED. AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BERMAN VIA MENTAL IMPACT REVIEWS RIGHT. AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IF. IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN CONCURRENTLY. YOU WON'T MAKE THE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT YEAH AND AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING -- UPDATED IN THERE'S THERE'S TWO CENTRAL VALLEY THERE'S THE BAKERSFIELD AREA LOCALLY PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE AND THEN THERE'S THE Y. WHICH IS IN THE MADERA MERCED AREA. SO BOTH OF THOSE CURRENTLY BECAUSE OF FEDERAL ENGAGEMENT A GOING FIRST IS GOING FOR TO SEE FOR FIRST. SO THERE'S PUBLIC AT HEARINGS IN PUBLIC PROCESS ON THE SEQUENCE SIDE BUT WITHOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGING ON THE KNEE BESIDE WERE UNABLE TO GO FORWARD WITH THOUSAND THAT. CREATE THAT DELAY -- WE DO NEED THEIR RE ENGAGEMENT -- BECAUSE IT A WE WANNA CLEAR THOSE SEGMENTS AND THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS TO NEARBY THAT'S THAT THE PLAN. AT WITH THE GRANT AGREEMENT SO -- YOU KNOW THE FOR THE FEDS -- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS INTERESTED IN AND HOLDING US TO THE SCHEDULE BUT WE DEFINITELY NEED THEIR ENGAGEMENT. AT TO REVIEW THE NEPA DOCUMENT OR TO GO FORTH AND I DO NEED BY ASSIGNMENT WHICH IS A PROCESS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE CALTRANS IS ABLE TO ACT AS THE FEDERAL NEPA LEAD? AND CERTIFY ON THEIR BEHALF AND THAT WE'VE APPLIED FOR THAT AS WELL TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR A NEAT ASSIGNMENT FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. YEAH I THINK WITH ALL OF THIS UNCERTAINTY -- NOT JUST AND FUNDING BUT IN LIKE. THE THE NEPA -- ENGAGEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE'RE STILL CONDUCTING THE E. I. R. AS IN. IN FOR THE WHOLE. OF HIGH SPEED RAIL INCLUDING MY DISTRICT IN THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF OF THE RAIL. PLAN [inaudible] WELL I WOULD JUST MENTION THAT AS FAR AS THE THE BENEFIT OF DURING THE III OURS IS A A IT. IT RESOLVE SOME OF THOSE RADISHES AND OF COURSE THE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS THAT'S WHERE YOU LOOK AT EVERY OPTION TO MITIGATE AND REDUCE ANY. UNNECESSARY -- A STRUCTURE AS BEING TAKEN OR IN -- TRY TO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO FIND THE BEST ALTERNATIVE SO IN IN GOING FORWARD WITH THOSE NO HOPE THAT THAT PROVIDES MORE CERTAINTY. ON ON ROUTES AND AND THAT -- PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT -- ALSO DURING THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK CAN HELP SOME OTHER RAIL PROJECTS WE MENTIONED SOME OF THE SHARED CORRIDORS SOME SOME INSTANCES OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ABLE TO CLEAR SOMETHING ENVIRONMENTALLY -- THAT SUBSET OF THAT PROJECT MAY BE ABLE TO GO FOR IT UNDER THAT ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVAL -- FOR ANOTHER PROJECT TO A SMALLER SUBSET PROJECT. HEY WELL YOU KNOW. THIS IS THE HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT YOU KNOW PRIDE THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY -- AND YOU KNOW THE LOTS OF UNCERTAINTY. AND FUNDING IN FEDERAL ENGAGEMENT WHICH IS NECESSARY -- FOR THIS T. EVEN BE A REALITY EVEN FOR THE SMALL SEGMENT THAT IS BEING PROPOSED TODAY -- AND I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE OTHER OPTIONS -- FOR THIS. YOU KNOW THIS PROJECT IN -- AND YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF IT ALREADY THE LAST YEAR'S -- HAS BEEN LOTS OF COST OVERRUNS -- AND EACH YEAR IN OF THE PUBLIC HEARS. THE INCREASE IN PROJECTED BUDGET FOR THE OVERALL PROJECT -- AND I JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO GET. EVEN OUR OWN STATE ENGAGED IN THIS -- HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT AND THE WILL TO FUND IT -- SO I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE UPDATES. AND MORE OPTIONS FOR IT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU [inaudible] MR FUNG. BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- I SAID BEFORE IT THE ONLY PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS PAST BEHAVIOR SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND. THAT LOW EVERYONE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ORIGINAL. I INTENT OF PROP WHEN IT WAS SO DALY OPENED EXPLAINED OR TAKE A WHAT THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM A DESIGN SYSTEM WAS WAS TO BE. SURE SO PROP ONE A ENVISIONED -- KIND OF TWO PHASES TO THE PROJECT SO PHASE ONE WAS TO GO FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA DOWN TO ANAHEIM PHASE TWO IS TO EXTEND FURTHER. ON SACRAMENTO IN THE NORTH IN SAN DIEGO IN THE SOUTH AND SO THAT WAS THE ON THE GENERAL BROAD VISION AND THERE IS SOME ADDITIONAL SPECIFICITY ALSO LAID OUT SO FULLY ELECTRIFIED COMPLETELY SEPARATE LINE. I I BELIEVE IT WAS INTENDED TO BE. I DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT IT READ IT THAT IT SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT WHETHER IT'S TO BE. FULLY SEPARATED OR NOT BUT CERTAINLY THE IMPLICATION OF THE BUILDING UP. OF RAIL LINE FROM THOSE POINTS I DON'T THINK IT WAS IT WAS SUPER STRESSED THAT SPECIFIED IN THE IN THE MEASURE OKAY SO BUT AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE A LINE THAT GOES FROM. SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM. ELECTRIFIED -- SEPARATE OR BLENDED IN SOME FASHION CORRECT. I BELIEVE SO YEAH OKAY SO I HEAR A LOT OF WORDS LIKE -- RE FOCUSED. DOWNSIZED -- CHANGE SO THAT I TO AUTHORITY CAN TELL ME IT HAS THE GOVERNOR DOWNSIZE THIS PROJECT WHAT IS TO THE POSITION OF THE ADMINISTRATION ARE WE GOING TO STILL DO. A SAN FRANCISCO IN ANAHEIM AS PROP ONE A VISION A VISION OR WHAT IS THE PROJECT IN ITS CURRENT FORM SURE. FOR WHAT THE GOVERNOR STATED THE STAY REFERRED TO NO REGARDING THE PROJECT IN LOOKING AT THE MONEY WE HAD AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE. SO -- YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE PRIOR BUSINESS PLAN TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE TO TWENTY FIFTY THINGS LIKE THAT SO THIS DOESN'T ASSUME THAT. THIS JUST LOOKS AT THE CURRENT MONEY THAT'S DIRECTED TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND WHAT'S -- CITED AS IS EARLIER MENTIONED IS SEVEN ABOUT TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION FROM THE VARIOUS SOURCES WHICH ARE ONE A TO CAP AND TRADE IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS ALREADY -- AWARDED TO THE PROJECT. SO I GUESS THAT'S THE CONFUSION I I SAT AND LISTENED TO THE SAY THE STATE. AND AND ALL THE REPORTS AFTERWARDS WAS THE GOVERNOR DOWNSIZE THE PROJECT SO HAS THE GOVERNOR DOWNSIZE THE PROJECT. NO IT THEY WERE RECOGNIZING THE BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH THESE ARE THE MONIES WE HAVE THIS IS WHAT WE CAN GET DONE WITH THE MONEY WE HAVE. IN GETTING THIS DONE AND I THINK THIS GETS TO THIS ISSUE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON RAISED A CREDIBILITY WHO NEED TO DELIVER THOSE. CAPITAL PROJECTS ON THE GROUND AND HAVING DELIVERED THAT HAVING. AB DEMONSTRATING HIGHS RAIL SERVICE BY GETTING THE TRAIN SETS GETTING THAT UP AND OPERATING. NO THAT IS THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK AND THINK THAT FOCUS ON DELIVERY FOCUS ON BUILDING WHAT WE CAN WITH THE EXISTING MONEY. THAT'S THE FIRST IMPORTANT STEP AND THEN ULTIMATELY YES THAT EXTENSION TO THE BAY AREA THAT EXTENSION TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT STILL PART OF THE VISION BUT WE DON'T HAVE A FUNDING PATH RIGHT NOW TO GET THERE. BUT IN GETTING THIS FIRST BUILDING BLOCK WERE ADVANCING THE SYSTEM AND I BELIEVE THAT AT SOME POINT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL RE ENGAGE BECAUSE HIGH SPEED RAIL AROUND THE COUNTRY. YEAH THERE'S INCREASING INTEREST OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AT THIS WELL SO I DO BELIEVE AT SOME POINT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL RESEARCH THE SO LET LET LET'S LET'S FOCUS ON THE FUNDING -- YOU KNOW AS AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED BEFORE E. WEBER NO MARGIN OF ERROR -- MAG I GET THE CONTINGENCY ARGUMENT BUT YOU YOUR COST FOR THE CENTER VALLEY IS TWENTY POINT FOUR AND YOU'VE IDENTIFIED TWENTY POINT. FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ASSUME. RIGHT SO [inaudible] UNDER. THE ON PAGE THIRTY TWO YOU'VE INDICATED THAT THE ON GOING CONSTRUCTION OF MADERA AND WASCO HAS INCREASED ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S CORRECT [inaudible] AND THEN. YES THAT THE PROJECT IT'S A DEVICE GOING UP ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. INCLUDE YES INCLUDING THE CONTINGENCY WE HAVE A BASELINE COST IS UP ONE POINT EIGHT SO THAT'S THE BEST LIKE US WHAT IS THE HIGHER RANGE COST. IT'S THE HIGHER RIGHTS THIRTEEN THIRTY THIRTEEN BILLION SO THE THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION THAT ALSO REPRESENTS THE COST FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT ALSO THE BOOKENDS INVESTMENTS. SO AS IT SO JUST TO BE ACCURATE WE GOT A RANGE. RIGHT AS YOU INDICATED A CONTINGENCY SO THE COST COULD BE. TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION OR IT COULD BE THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION NOW LET ME IF I SAID SOMETHING EARLY I APOLOGIZE THE RANGERS ARE FROM THE FUNDING. THE FUNDING RANGES ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION TO TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE RANGE FOR THE POTENTIAL FINDING. MAINLY DUE THE CAP AND TRADE BECAUSE THAT FLUCTUATES. THE COST OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY DID GO FROM TEN POINT SIX TO SEVEN OTHER TWELVE POINT FOUR THAT'S THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S ABOUT A 17% INCREASE. AND AGAIN OF THAT 17% ABOUT 10% OF THAT 9% OF THAT IS THIS CONTINGENCY THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. BUT AT THE PREVIOUS YEAR THE COST SEGMENT WENT UP TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION. FROM THE SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT SO SO WE ARE NOW SEEING A PATTERN. YOU DIDN'T DO AGENT DO A COST ESTIMATE AT THE BEGINNING A TWENTY TWELVE RIGHT AND THEN NOW IT'S THERE WAS THE TEN BILLION. NOW IT'S TWELVE BILLION. WHAT I WOULD EXPLAIN THAT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR THE 17% INCREASE IS? AGAIN YOU HAVE ABOUT 9% CONTINGENCY I WOULD SAY YOU HAVE ABOUT -- THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT IS SCOPE CHANGE SO WE ADDED SCOPE TO THE PROJECT. WHICH IS THE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION. IS WHAT I WOULD CALL COST INCREASES BECAUSE WE KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW MUCH SOMETHING'S GOING TO COST YOU. BUT YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER COST OVER A NO ONE CAN GUARANTEE IF IT WILL BE COST YOU CRY THAT'S PART OF THE THE THE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A CONTINGENCY SO THE LIKELIHOOD OF A COST OVERRUN IS PRETTY. CERTAIN. THERE'S A IF IF I AND IF I IF I OUTLINED WHAT WHAT IS AND READ THIS IS INDICATED. IF THE FED THE NEED FOR REVIEW ISN'T COMPLETED IF THE FEDS DON'T RE ENGAGE IF THE RIGHT AWAY ACQUISITION GOES UP IF THERE'S LAWSUITS THAT SAY THAT YOU KNOW LONGER -- A BYE BYE PROP ONE EIGHTY THAT DELAYS THE PROJECT THAT ALSO INCREASES COSTS CORRECT THE THOSE WOULD BE REST YES THAT WOULD. ALL THOSE ARE ALL ASSUMPTIONS BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM AND INTO THIS REPORT. WHICH IS WHY THE LA L. AS INDICATED THAT THIS REPORT IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE AND THE ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE IS VERY VERY. CONCERNING CORRECT. THE ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE OF THE REST THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY AND YES THE REFEREE ENGAGEMENT IS IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS PROJECT -- WE DID FACTOR IN THAT PIECE -- AND ALL THE OTHER WRIST AGAIN WHICH IS WHY WE INCREASED. AGAIN WITH IMITATE A P. TEN FROM THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. TO A PIECE OF A NUMBER TO ADDRESS THOSE REST THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO THE SO THEN IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING WHY DIDN'T YOU DO AB SEVENTY OR OR HIGHER ON THE FULL. THE FULL ONLINE. THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS THE MORE THIS PROJECT GOES ON THE MORE WE NOW UTILITY COSTS -- RIGHT AWAY COST -- WE LEARN FROM THOSE THINGS AND SO I WOULD SAY EARLIER ON IN THE PROJECT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH THE P. -- SEVENTY BUT I THINK WE FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE NOW AT LEAST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PIECE. A PIECE OF ANY NUMBER IS IS PRETTY ACCURATE WHICH AGAIN. WHICH IS THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. SO YOU SAY THAT YOU KEEP CAN'T DO A P. SEVENTY FOR THE FULL ALIGNMENT OF THE FOR ALIGNMENT IF THAT WERE NOW STIPULATING THAT THE PROJECT HASN'T CHANGED WHAT WE WERE. WERE BOND BY THAT -- THE NEXT TWO THOUSAND TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN WE WILL HAVE TO DO ANOTHER ESTIMATE ON WHAT THE VALUE TO VALLEY'S GONNA COST AN ACTUAL CHANGE ONE'S GOING TO COST SO THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THAT REPORT TODAY WE DON'T HAVE THAT THAT'S AND TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS TODAY. SO WHY WHY WOULD WHY WASN'T THERE DECISION BE MADE THAT MAYBE PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF WHY ON THE FULL LINE. THE TO DO A PIECE OF ANY OR ANY TYPE OF ESTIMATE FOR THE VALLEY VALLEY OR THE PHASE ONE IS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME AGAIN THIS PROJECT OF THE REPORT FOCUSED ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING TODAY -- BUT IT IT IS A REQUIREMENT OF TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN AND IT WILL BE THERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION TODAY. SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TO DO A AT A COST ASSESSMENT FOR THE ACTUAL AND WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THE ANALYSIS DONE. TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THAT NUMBER TODAY AND SO WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL TWENTY TWENTY TO GET THAT YES AS NOW IN TERMS OF WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON RELATED TO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT. REGIONAL INNER CITY SERVICE IS AS USUAL YOU ALLUDED TO IT AND ON PAGE. SIXTY FOUR SO YEAH YOU'RE NOW DOING REGIONAL REGIONAL INNER CITY SERVICE. ON THIS A LOT ON ON THIS ALIGNMENT [inaudible] SURE [inaudible] WHAT ARE? YOU KNOW WHAT'S PROPOSED. IS -- BEGIN THAT HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILE A HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT THAT'S FULLY INTEGRATED WITH THE OTHER RAIL AND IN THE SOUTH CAN ADD BUS CONNECTING SERVICE. AS SO THAT THAT WOULD BE. DESCRIBED IN THE PLAN IS THE IT'S SAFE. WHAT WE'RE DESCRIBING THE CONNECTIONS OF THE RAIL IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE JUST RUNNING A WE JUST RUNNING TRAINS DIESEL TRAINS OR ART AMTRAK TRAINS -- CONNECTING THE THE CITIES OR MAYBE I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHEN YOU SAY -- AND REGIONAL INTERCITY SERVICE IS GOING TO BE USED SURE. SO -- PASSENGER GOING TO SAY FROM BAKERSFIELD MERCED WOULD GET ON A HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAIN. AND THAT TRIP FROM BAKERSFIELD MERCED WOULD TAKE SOMETHING LIKE AN HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES. FOR PASSENGERS THEIR CONTINUING FURTHER NORTH PERHAPS TO SACRAMENTO IN MERCED -- THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BOARD A EITHER SAN JOAQUIN OR A STRAIN AND CONTINUE THAT TRIP FURTHER NORTH AGAIN EITHER TO SACRAMENTO OR INTO THE BAY AREA -- AS WELL TO THE ACE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN CONNECTION. THIS. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT AND TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BUT WELL IN THE MEANTIME WHAT IS WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THAT AND LOOK LIKE. SURE FOR THE MEANTIME WE'RE CONTINUING TO BUILD THE SYSTEM WE'RE CONTINUING TO EXPAND SOUTH AT BAKERSFIELD AGAIN -- BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN THAT'S WHEN THE BAKERSFIELD EXTENSION WAS HIS PLAN TO BE COMPLETED. AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS WOULD INITIALLY SO YOU'RE TELLING ME AT NO TIME IS THERE GOING TO BE -- CONVENTIONAL RAIL BEING USED ON THIS LINE. THAT'S CORRECT SO IT'S ALL IT'S GOING TO HIGH SPEED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOK CORRECT LOOKING AT GETTING. BUILDING ON TO BAKERSFIELD BUILDING ON TO MERCED AND HAVING THE TRAIN SERVICE BE THE ELECTRIFIED RAIL SERVICE SO SO FROM STE WELL I DON'T YOU'RE GOING TO BAKERSFIELD BUT FROM SO POPULAR AVENUE. TO HER SAID IT'S HIGH SPEED RAIL. THIS ONE AND INITIATE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL UNTIL THOSE EXTENSION TO BAKERSFIELD OCCURS AGAIN THIS IS -- WOULD GO FROM MADERA TO BAKERSFIELD AS THE FIRST RAIL SERVICE ON THE NEW AT SYSTEMS AND THAT INITIATE BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN SIR WHEN I WHEN I READ -- IN THE REPORT. YOU SAY THAT -- YOU HAVE GAINED FROM SERVICE SO IN TERMS SERVICE IS A PASSENGER TRAINS. BUT I'M NOT HIGH SPEED. OR THE HIGH SPEED. NO FOR THAT SEGMENT THAT MADERA MADERA TO BAKERSFIELD HIGH SPEED TRAINS AND HOW FAST THEY GONNA GO. WELL THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GO OUT THE UP TO TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR AT THAT THAT HIGH SPEED. OKAY SO YOU YOU'RE GOING TO GUARANTEE THAT GOES TO HER MILES AN HOUR THROUGH BUT FROM BAKER TO THE MADERA -- BECAUSE THEY THEY GET THIS IS THE WERE BUILDING THE ALIGNMENT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE PROP ONE A REQUIREMENTS ON SPEED SO YEAH THE SYSTEMS BEING BUILT FOR THAT SPEED AND THE TRAINS WILL BE ACQUIRED. AT TO TO MEET THOSE SOME SPECIFICATION WHERE THERE'S NO XIN COME THAT DID SLOW TRAINS ARE GOING TO PUT ON THIS TRACK. BUT AGAIN WHAT'S HOSTESS IS FAST TRAIN SO I'M NOT SURE WITH AS I MENTIONED WITH THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION OVER TIME YOU KNOW THEY'VE ASKED FOR DIFFERENT PLANS FOR EARLY USE OF THE SYSTEM BUT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. WANTING TO DO ELECTRIFIED SERVICE AND GO DIRECTLY TO THAT -- NOT THE DIESEL TRAINS IN THE INTERIM SO THAT'S WHAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WITH FRA IN RECENT -- IN PRIOR YEARS DISCUSSION OF EARLY EARLY OPERATION OF THE SEGMENT SO LET ME READ ON PAGE. NINE SAYS AS PART OF THE FACE OF LIMITATION THE ASSETS BUILT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY COULD BE USED BY AN INTERIM PASSENGER TRAIN OPERATOR. UNTIL ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECAME AVAILABLE. THIS APPROACH WAS MEMORIALIZED IN THE FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENTS SPECIFICALLY THE DIESEL SAN JOAQUIN INTERCITY PASSENGER TRAINS WHICH OPERATE ON SHARED FREIGHT RAIL TRACKS COULD BE SHIFTED TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRACKS TO REALIZE. A REDUCE PASTOR TRAIN TRAVEL TIME IN CENTRAL VALLEY. I THINK THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY CORRECT WELL THAT THAT -- DIESEL USE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT IS AN INTERIM USE OPTION. BUT WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED IN INCLUDING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE ELECTRIFIED WITHIN A FOLLOW UP ON PAGE TEN WHICH IS HOWEVER THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT FUNDING. TO COMPLETE THE VALLEY TO VALLEY LIVE WITH THE CURRENT AVAILABLE COMMITTED FUNDING THEREFORE THE AUTHORITY STATED ITS INTENT TO SEEK THE SUPPORT. OF THE T. L. UNVEILING THE POTENTIAL FOR AN INTERIM SERVICE IN THE CENTER VALLEY REVISED EARLY BENEFITS CORRECT IN AN INTERIM SERVICES THE ELECTRIFIED SERVICE OKAY. SO THEN ON PAGE FIFTEEN YOU INDICATED A SIXTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL IF EVEN IF WE RAN. THIS INTERIM SERVICE IN AN EXHIBIT ONE POINT TWO IT'S POTENTIALLY EIGHTY TWO POINT EIGHT IF YOU DON'T DO IT. RIGHT IF I'M THE FARE BOX REVENUE SURE AND WHAT THAT'S INDICATING AND THIS IS IN THE EACH YEAR ANALYSIS IS LOOKING AT THE COMBINED SERVICE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH IS ACE AND SAN JOAQUIN AND THE INTERVIEWS HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT. AND INDICATING WITHOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL THERE'S A OPERATING SUPPORT OF ABOUT EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN RIDERSHIP THE INCREASE IN FAREBOX RECOVERY. THAT OPERATING SUPPORT ACTUALLY FALLS BY TWENTY MILLION TO ABOUT SIXTY THREE ZERO SIXTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL. WHY DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A SHORTFALL THE CURRENTLY -- ACE AND THE SAN JOAQUIN'S RECEIVE -- OPERATING SUPPORT AS DO THE COMMUTER RAIL AND OTHER INTERCITY RAIL -- PROVIDERS RIGHT BUT IS IT DOESN'T COVER THE COST. BUT IN LOOKING AT YOUR REPORT IT DOESN'T COVER THE COST COST IS TWENTY TWO TO TWO AND A TWENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION AND THE REVENUES IS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE ONE EIGHT MILLION. THERE YOU HAVE AN ARROW SHOWING AT A SHORTFALL HOW DO YOU MAKE UP THAT SHORTFALL. WELL THAT THAT IS THE OPERATING SUPPORT AGAIN THAT FALLS WITH THE ADVENT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL RELATIVE TO EXHIBIT ONE POINT TWO ON THE RIGHT SO DINNER I I AGREE WITH ME I I'M WITH YOU. THE SHORTFALL DROPS FROM EIGHTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION TO SIXTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION. SO YOU SAID THAT SIXTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL. WHY I WANTED I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S FAIR TO CALL THE SHORTFALL SO THESE ARE AS I MENTIONED WITH COMMUTER RAIL WITH INNER CITY RAIL? THOSE ARE SERVICES THAT TODAY RECEIVE OPERATING SUPPORT SO FAREBOX RECOVERY DOESN'T FIND A SUPPORT COME SOMEWHERE. WHEN THE CASE OF INNER CITY RAIL -- THE STATE -- PROVIDES FUNDING SO THE STATE. MAKES UP A SHORTFALL. THAT'S CORRECT IGHT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COSTA REVENUE IS A SHORTFALL CORRECT -- I'M USING THE LANGUAGE OF THE REPORT SURE I JUST IN IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT OF A BASELINE FUNDING IS IS WHAT I'M GETTING AT THAT WEEK WE FIND THESE SERVICES TODAY THESE INTER CITY RAIL SERVICES. AND IS OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING AS WELL FOR COMMUTER RAIL SERVICES SO THOSE ARE EXISTING. FUNDING MECHANISMS AND AND I MEAN FOR THESE [inaudible] SO. I THINK WE'RE SAYING I THINK I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO TO TRY. TO NOT REALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT LET ME READ FROM THE REBUTTAL FROM PROP ONE A IN THE ON THE BALLOT [inaudible] WHICH IS. IT'S SIMPLE AND FAIR ONCE COMPLETED THE USERS OF THE SYSTEM PAY FOR THE SYSTEM. RIGHT SO THERE'S NO SUBSIDY THERE'S NO THERE'S NO STATE FUNDING IN ADDITION TO MAKING UP THE SHORTFALL. I MEAN THIS IS WHAT IS ON THE MEND PATTERSON'S ALLUDING TO WRITE. WHICH IS. WHAT WHO MAKES WHO PAYS FOR THE SHORTFALL? AS A STATE AT THE COMMENT. AND SUBSIDIZE AND BACK FILL. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST IN THE REVENUES OF THE SYSTEM. BUT AGAIN IT'S AN EIGHT I THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'RE GENERALLY IN IN AGREEMENT ON ON THE STEPS FACTUAL ISSUES THAT FOR THE THE FALL -- NON SUBSIDIZED THE READ THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LINKING -- HIGH SPEED RAIL PROVIDED SERVICE -- THAT IS LOOKING AT A LONGER SEGMENT THAT WOULD GET VALLEY TO VALLEY SAN JOSE TO BAKERSFIELD SAY THAT'S THE SEGMENT THAT WOULD. WHERE YOU'D HAVE THE RIDERSHIP -- REVENUE FULLY FUNDING THE OPERATIONS AGAIN THESE INTERIM SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES BE A CALTRAIN ALBEIT CENTRAL VALLEY SERVICE -- THESE ARE SERVICES WHERE THERE ARE IS OPERATING SUPPORT CURRENTLY AND THAT WOULD CONTINUE WITH THE OPERATE WITH THE INTERIM SERVICES LET ME ASK THE QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY. DOES. THE CENTRAL VALLEY PORTION PAY FOR ITSELF. IN TERMS OF OPERATIONS IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING. BUT THERE THERE WOULD BE ONGOING OPERATING SUPPORT -- FOR THE THREE SEGMENTS THAT ARE OPERATING THE SYSTEM TOGETHER AGAIN THE A FOR A FOUR BY WHO. AT THE STATE WOULD BE PART OF THAT THE STATE WOULD PAY FOR IT WE ARE TODAY SO THAT IS NOT. SO WHAT WAS IN THE BALLOT ARGUMENT IS THAT TRUE. THE USERS OF THE SYSTEM PAY FOR THE SYSTEM. YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW THAT THE STATE'S GONNA OP THE OFFSET SOME OF THE COSTS. WELL AGAIN THIS IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHO'S PROVIDING THE SERVICE IT WOULD NOT BE DIRECTLY HIGH SPEED RAIL PROVIDING THE SERVICE IT WOULD BE ONE OF THESE OTHER RAIL PROVIDERS. AGAIN IS DONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN LOS ANGELES WITH THE THE BOOK IN INVESTMENTS SO MY LAST QUESTION IS THIS -- AND I APPRECIATE THE GERMANS PATIENTS SO IN IN THIS OUR NEWS ARTICLE I THINK OFF THE NBC IS NBC STORY. I WANT TO READ THIS QUOTE AND I WANT TO GET YOUR ANSWER OR YOUR PERSPECTIVE. LUTON SENSORS ON AN INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW GROUP THAT OVERSEES THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT FOR THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE THOMPSON TOLD NBC BAY AREA HE BELIEVES THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS IN CRISIS. QUOTE THE TRUTH IS THAT THE PACE OF CONSTRUCTION REALLY WILL HAVE TO PICK UP RAPIDLY IF IN FACT IT'S GOING TO BE FINISHED BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE THOMPSON SAID. CAN THIS BE DONE. WE WELL WE NEED TO ASK THE AUTHORITY AND WE NEED TO MAKE THEM. WE NEED TO MAKE THEM MAKE A STE FOUR SOLID ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENT ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO. THOMPSON BELIEVES THAT THE ONLY WAY THE PROJECT CAN CONTINUE AS DESIGNED THIS FOR THE STATE TO RAISE TAXES AND DRASTICALLY INCREASE CONSTRUCTION. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT. STATEMENT. BUT THE I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO ACCELERATE OUR DELIVERY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO I AGREE WITH THAT A 100%. SO THAT'S NOT A HARD GO IS THAT A MAYBE. GETTY HAVE AGREED WITH THE STABLE WE NEED TO ACCELERATE OUR OUR CONSTRUCTION SO THE SAME MSQ IN HIS THAT THOMPSON BELIEVES THE ONLY WAY THE PROJECT CONTINUOUS DESIGNED IS FOR THE STATE TO RAISE MORE TAXES AND DRASTICALLY INCREASE CONSTRUCTION. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'D THAT THE ALREADY AND ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING. AGAIN NOT ON THE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MONEY WE HAVE INTO DELIVERING. A HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT WITH THE MONEY WE HAVE AN FOR C. TO HAVE IN THE FUTURE. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT INCREASING TAXES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THE IDEA IS TO GET THE DELIVERY DONE GET THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS UP AND OPERATING AND THEN YES I BELIEVE LOOK FOR THAT FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP TO RESUME. SURE THAT WOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. SO ALL THIS AND WITH THIS STATEMENT -- THIS THE LAST RECORD AS WE NEED TO HAVE THAT THE ALREADY MAKE A FULL SOLID ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENT AND I DON'T HEAR A FULL SOLID ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENT. THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THIS REPORT OUR OUR ARE DIFFICULT. TO BE CUT TO TO ACCEPT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T. YOU THE REPORT ISN'T IN REALITY RIGHT SO THE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE HIGHER. THE MARGINS ARE JEWS ARE YOU USE THAT YOU HAVE NO MARGIN. THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING GOES DOWN OVER TIME IF CAP AND TRADE IS GOING TO SUCCEED. IF IT AND AND THAT IS BEEN ACCEPTED BY BY BY EVERYONE EVEN WHO DOES YOU DESIGN CAP AND TRADE. NEED BUZZ -- AND UNCLEAR WHETHER YOU CAN GET A PROPOSAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ENGAGED -- SICK REVIEWS ARE GOING FORWARD LAWSUITS ARE GOING FORWARD. THEY WHAT WAS TOLD TO THE VOTERS IN TWENTY AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND WHAT THE DESIGN OF THIS PROJECT IS NOW IS NOT THE SAME. IT IS NOT THE SAME NO ONE CAN TELL ME THAT WHAT WAS TOLD TO THE VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHAT THAT SEGMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. FROM BAY THE BAY AREA TO ANAHEIM THAT THIS REPORT DOES NOT OUTLINED THAT AND SO I CAN WAIT TILL TWENTY TWENTY FOR YOU TO TELL ME WHAT THIS NEW ALIGNMENTS GOING TO BE AND WHETHER WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE OR NOT. BUT WE'RE GONNA WAIT TWENTY TWENTY AND WE'RE GOING TO SPEND AND YOU GUYS ARE GONNA SPEND A WHOLE LOT MORE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT YOU CAN GIVE ME A FULL ANALYSIS A WITH THIS ENTIRE PROJECT IN A LOOK LIKE AND GIVE ME SOME RANGES BUT RIGHT NOW IF I EVEN IF I ACCEPTED THE L. E. L. ANALYSIS WHICH IS TRUE. ALL SIX OF FOR ASSUMPTIONS ARCHER OUR OUR OUR OUR OUR CONCERNS ARE TRUE. YOU REFOCUS THE PROJECT WHICH IS NOT WHAT DOES PROMISE TO THE VOTERS. ACTUAL COSTS CAN BE HIGHER THEY WILL BE HIGHER WE HAVE A 70% CHANCE OF SUCCESS AT 30% CHANCE OF FAILURE THERE'S UNCERTAINTY WITH CAP AND TRADE. THERE'S NO FUNDING OUTLINED. THAT IN DETAIL FROM MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD -- AND THE LEGISLATURE NOW HAS TO REASSESS THAT IS PROJECT. AT A TIME WHEN YOU'RE NOT GIVING US ANY INFORMATION UNTIL NEXT YEAR. AND SO THIS IS REALLY TROUBLING TO ME AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THIS PROJECT GOT STOP. AND AND AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE AS A MEMBER RIVAS OR WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE YOUR COMMUNITY. I LAYS AS SUGGESTED YOU TALK TO SOME AND PATTERSON BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FRESNO RIGHT NOW [inaudible] MISTER MOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU -- MISS RANDA'SFOR YOUR GOOD WORK ON A COMPLEX PROJECT AND FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS TODAY. WELL I JOIN THE CONVERSATION MIDSTREAM HERE ON THE DAY SO OF MY APOLOGIES IF -- YOU'VE TOUCHED ON THIS BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE REFERENCES -- TO UNDER THE EARLY -- INTERIM SERVICE SCENARIO THAT THE SERVICE IS CONTINGENT. ON A HIGHLY INTEGRATED RAIL SERVICE FROM SACRAMENTO OAKLAND AND SAN JOSE INTO -- THE BAY AREA DO YOU ANTICIPATE. ANY DELAY SPECIFICALLY -- WITH THE BOOK AND PROJECTS OBSERVATION -- THE JOB CENTERS -- TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH UNDER THIS SCENARIO DO YOU EXPECT -- DELAY. NO AND YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW CARE CALTRAIN IS IS MOVING FORWARD WITH CONSTRUCTION AND THE RAIL CARS I BELIEVE -- ARE BEING BUILT. ALREADY AS WELL IN UTAH -- SO THAT PROJECTS IS CLEARED ENVIRONMENTAL ALL THE FUNDING AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED. MONEY IS BEING REIMBURSED TO CALTRANS -- FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECTS SO THAT THAT FIFTY MILE -- SEGMENT BEING ELECTRIFIED YEAH ON THE PENINSULA IS IS GOING FORWARD AND THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT WOULD WOULD CHANGE THAT. I WILL MENTION IN LOS ANGELES -- THE LOS ANGELES UNION STATION PROJECT. AS ALSO HAVING SOME CHALLENGES WITH NEPA -- THEY'RE GOING FORWARD WITH A SEQUEL FOR STRATEGY AS WELL AT THIS PERIOD OF TIME. BUT AGAIN AS FAR AS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDING AND THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT WOULD CHANGE THAT COMMITMENT. TO WE'RE STILL VERY MUCH -- SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PROJECT AND WANT TO BE A FUNDING PARTNER FOR THAT PROJECT RIGHT SO YOU'VE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. NIPAH NET. TENUOUS RELATIONSHIP -- TO PUT IT. A NICELY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN A IN. TWENTY NINETEEN DO YOU EXPECT. THE BOOK AND PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY -- YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT NEPA I THINK YOU SAID DEEPER FIRST IS THAT RIGHT SO SO. ARE THERE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS THAT ARE STILL NEEDED. OUTSTANDING APPROVALS FOR THE TO BOOK AND PROJECTS -- FOR THE LA UNION STATION LA ONLY BUT I BELIEVE CALTRAIN IS ALL ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEARED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OKAY AND I WOULD JUST I CONCLUDE YOU KNOW THIS THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER THE TIME HORIZON OF THIS PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO SEE MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS PROBABLY. WITH PERHAPS A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW. FACT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. LET'S TALK ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS INFRASTRUCTURE NATIONALLY IS GOING TO GET. ADDITIONAL ATTENTION BY MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS MOVING FORWARD SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IN A TWENTY NINETEEN CONTEXT. BUT THIS IS A LAUNCH TO DON'T PROJECT. OF OF MASSIVE SCALE. NOT AND I ANTICIPATE AT SOME POINT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE A FULL PARTNER IN THIS AND WE NEED THAT WE DO. BUT LOOKING AT THE TWENTY NINETEEN SORT OF A CONFIGURATION AND UP AND UP EXTRAPOLATING THAT OUT -- IN WELL INTO THE FUTURE I THINK IS IS UP. A LITTLE BIT OF FOLLY BUT I SHARE THE ANXIETY ABOUT THE CURRENT. RELATIONSHIP -- BUT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON A VERY VERY DIFFICULT TOPIC AS CHAIR. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR AND I THINK WE'LL TAKE UP PUBLIC COMMENT ON ON ON ON THE SIDE A BIT BEFORE WE MOVE ON ISSUE -- FOR SINCE WE'VE ALREADY SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THIS ITEM WE SHOULD ISOLATE THE PUBLIC COMMENT TOO I THINK. BUT I WANT TO BE -- A CLEAR IN UNDERSTANDING -- THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY IS IT CORRECT THAT WE'RE BEING ASKED -- TO A DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROJECT CAN MOVE FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. CORRECT YEAH THEIR DATES IN A LETTER OF COURSE -- INDICATING CONCERN ON ON THE SCHEDULE -- HIGH SPEED RAIL RESPONDED NO INDICATING WERE COMPLYING WITH THE GRANT AGREEMENT AND STILL ABLE TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINES FOR THE SCHEDULE -- SO AGAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A IS A PARTNER IN ACHIEVING SOME OF THOSE DELIVERABLES SUCH AS THE FEDERAL NEPA -- HAVE REVIEW AND APPROVAL. AND YET IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW IS -- ESSENTIALLY REFUSING TO ENGAGE -- ON MOVING THE PROJECT FORWARD. WOULD THAT BE AN ACCURATE STATEMENT THAT'S CORRECT YEAH THEY HAVEN'T SAID. THAT THEN PENCILS DOWN ON THAT THE NEED FOR WORK I BELIEVE SINCE LAST AUGUST. AND AS SINCE THE LETTERS CAME OUT THEY THEY HAVEN'T -- HAVEN'T MET WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. WELL I THINK THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. LET'S TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO BE. HEARD ON THE ON THE SIDE OF ISSUE. THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE BIG WITH THEIR NEED ASSISTANCE FOR THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. THIS COMMITTEE FOR SEVERAL YEARS GOING ON TEN YEARS NOW HAS HEARD ABOUT THESE. COST INCREASES THAT YOU'VE ALL BEEN DISCUSSING. IN ADDITION TO THE NBC -- INVESTIGATION THE LA TIMES ALSO RECENTLY COMPLETED THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST REASONS FOR THESE COST INCREASES. IS BECAUSE OF THE OVER RELIANCE FOR ALMOST COMPLETE RELIANCE ON PRIVATE SECTOR ENGINEERING CONSULTANTS TO RUN THE PROJECT. THEY HAVE PRIVATE SECTOR CONSULTANTS HIRING PRIVATE SECTOR CONSULTANTS TO OVERSEE PRIVATE SECTOR CONSULTANTS. HAVE BEING INSPECTED BY PRIVATE SECTOR CONSULTANTS ALL AT A COST OF TWO OR THREE TIMES THE COST OF WHAT. THE STATE EMPLOYED ENGINEER WOULD BE. WE THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD FIND A WAY OF HAVING THE AGENCY STAFF UP OVER THE LONGER TERM SO THAT YOU CAN REDUCE YOUR COSTS AND GAIN CONTROL OF THE PROJECT. AND REDUCE THESE COSTS IN GOING FORWARD WE DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD WAIT FOR FUTURE BUDGET YEAR -- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY SHOULD HEART START HIRING DESIGN ENGINEERS AND CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION ENGINEERS TO SAVE COSTS ON THE PROJECT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR BLOOM AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROLAND TO BROWN HI COME FROM SAN JOSE I HAVE NO AFFILIATION. I'D LIKE TO VERY BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE ALIGNMENT AND THE DECISION TO START OPERATIONS CENTER VALLEY. STARTING WITH THE ALIGNMENT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY. THAT THE NON ALIGNMENT BETWEEN MISS SET AND BAKERSFIELD WILL EVER BECOMPETITIVE WITH A TRAVEL IN BETWEEN LA AND SAN FRANCISCO. SO I URGE YOU TO HOLD ON THE FOOT OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT. UNTIL THE AUTHORITY TERMINATE ALL CONTRACTS SOUTH OF FRESNO. AND STARTS ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE ON A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN ZERO AND FRESNO. THAT REQUIRES LITTLE TO NO COMMENT. WITH REGARDS TO OPERATIONS. THE BUSINESS CASE FOR STARTING OPERATIONS CENTER VALLEY. IS BASED ON INCORRECT DATA. PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITY TO JUDGE THE TRAIN OPERATOR. INCLUDING INFLATED RIDERSHIP FIGURES IN CENTRAL VALLEY. LOW RIDERSHIP ESTIMATES AND INFLATED COST OF OPERATIONS IN THE PENINSULA. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST. THERE IS NO MENTION IN THE RIPPLES OF EMERGING OF EMERGING. PRIVATE SECTOR INTEREST. IN OPERATING A HIGH SPEED SERVICE BETWEEN. SAN FRANCISCO AND GET WROTE AND POTENTIALLY HOLLISTER THANK YOU. SO LET ME -- CLOSE THIS -- ITEM OUT WITH A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND THANK YOU -- MISTRANSLATED TEAM FOR PROVIDING US WITH -- WITH AN UPDATE HERE TODAY IT IS JUST AN UPDATE IT'S ONE STOP ALONG THE WAY -- THE THIS -- AT IN MY VIEW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT THAT REMAINS -- NOT JUST -- ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST IMPORTANT -- INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS BUT ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WE ARE -- ONE OF THE FEW INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS IN THE WORLD -- THAT TODAY NOT -- DO NOT HAVE HIGH SPEED RAIL NOW IS THAT IN AND OF ITSELF A REASON WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE IT HERE NO -- BUT THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS WHY HIGH SPEED RAIL IS IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA TO THE COUNTRY OF THOSE OF ALL BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE PAST THE VOTERS ACTUALLY WEIGHED IN ON THIS ALTHOUGH. I YOU KNOW IT WAS SOMETIME AGO BUT THEY PROVIDED THE SEED MONEY FOR THE PROJECT -- OPPOSITION TO THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN -- AGAIN OF THIS BIG PROJECT IT GENERATES OPPOSITION I GUESS I GET THAT -- BUT WHETHER -- THE SAME FOLKS WERE IN OPPOSITION WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY AND NOW THAT -- I THINK A MORE REALISTIC PROPOSALS BEING MADE -- IN RESPONSE TO THOSE WHO SAT AND COMPLAINED -- THERE'S NO MONEY TO BUILD OUT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE ACTUALLY CAN DO AND NOW WE HAVE AN UPDATE THAT TRIES TO DO EXACTLY THAT. AND THE SAME CRITICS ARE OF ALL OVER THE PROJECT SAYING WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS -- AND YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING AND ALL THE OTHER ARGUMENTS THAT WE HEAR AND I YOU KNOW I RESPECT THE FACT THAT THERE. ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROJECT PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S SO BIG AND PARTLY BECAUSE I'VE IT TAKES. UGH UGH A LONG TIME UNDER. ANY SCENARIO TO BUILD OUT A PROJECT TO OF THIS LENGTH AND THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF IN SPEND CERTAINTIES -- WHICH COME ALONG WITH ANY PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE. OF WE NEED TO WORK THROUGHOUT THE THROUGH THOSE ISSUES STEP BY STEP AND STAGE BY STAGE AND I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR. IS TRYING TO DO THAT NOW AND TAKE A MORE REALISTIC OF OF YOU OF WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE NEAR TERM UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STEPS. AND THAT THE FULL BUILD OUT OF THIS PROJECT IS ESSENTIAL -- AND AND NEEDS TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THE IN THE UPDATE -- I DON'T I DON'T THINK A AND THIS IS STILL TRUE AND IN EVERY DISTRICT IN THE STATE I THINK THIS IS A PROJECT THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT KIND OF SCRATCH THEIR HEADS AND THINK. IS IT REALISTIC IS IT NOT COULD THIS MONEY BE BETTER SPENT IN OTHER WAYS THERE ARE A LOT OF LEGITIMATE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS. BUT THE PROJECT ITSELF THE NEED FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL AS A ENVIRONMENTALLY FAVORABLE PROJECT -- AS A RELIEF VALVE FOR OUR BE LEADER -- AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FOLKS OUR AIRPORTS -- I YOU KNOW I KNOW MOST OF YOU WHO ARE HERE AND OR LISTENING -- TO THIS HEARING TODAY -- TRAVEL BY AIR FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. OF OUR AIRPORTS ARE NEAR MAXED OUT AND WE NEED TO BE THINKING LONG TERM FOR THE FUTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AIR TRAVEL -- IS ALSO. YOU KNOW USES A LOT OF FOSSIL FUELS AND WERE ABLE THROUGH HIGH SPEED RAIL TO SHIFT INTO A MORE SUSTAINABLE. OF A SYSTEM THERE ARE -- AMIRI OUT OF OTHER REASONS WHY THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT -- AND I THINK THE DEBATE IS GOING TO CONTINUE -- I REACHED SPECTRUM AS TRANSFER STEPPING INTO THIS ROLE COMING HERE TODAY AND SUFFERING THE THE THE SLINGS AND ARROWS -- WHICH THIS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THAT ARE THAT OVERSIGHT BUT YOU'RE HERE YOU'RE STILL STANDING THE PROJECT IS STILL STANDING AND I EXPECT THAT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. THE OVERSIGHT DEMANDING ANSWERS FROM YOU THAT -- HELP MAKE THIS A LONG TERM PROJECT THAT IS MAXIMALLY SUCCESSFUL FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS -- YOU'RE WELCOME AND WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE -- FOR BY THE WAY -- ISSUE THREE WAS JUST -- FOR THE SUIT DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS AS INFORMATION ONLY -- AND FOR WAS HERE A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT THE ISSUE FOR IS -- CONTRACT MANAGEMENT FINANCIAL OFFICE RESOURCES -- AGAIN WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ITEM TO HOLD OPEN AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE BIT LESS TIME ON THIS ONE THAT WE DID ON LAST. ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR RELEASES REPORT ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND AMONG OTHER FINDINGS FOUND THAT THE AUTHORITY SHOULD SHIFT. CERTAIN WORKLOAD ACTIVITIES FOR THE PRIVATE CAUGHT FROM THE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS THE STATE STAFF. WELL THE THOUGHT IS CONDUCTING A BROADER REVIEW OF THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION. THE INITIAL REQUEST YOU'VE WRITTEN FOR THE U. TODAY WILL REDUCE THE OVERALL PROGRAM COSTS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THANK YOU BE IMPLEMENTED FAIRLY QUICKLY BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ASSAULT POSITIONS SUPPORTING ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS CONTRACT MANAGEMENT. IN THE FINANCIAL OFFICE AND REPLACING THOSE CONSULTANTS WITH STATE STAFF. THE REQUESTED CLOSE AN INCREASE OF THIRTY FIVE STATE POSITIONS AT FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN PROPOSITION ONE A FUNDING WHICH WILL BE OFFSET BY REDUCTION OF THIRTY FIVE AND SO ON IF TEAS. AND FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THUS FREEING UP THE CONTRACT FUNDING FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES SUCH AS REAL OPERATIONS ENGINEERING AND INFRASTRUCTURE DELIVERY -- THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS SEEING NONE ALEJO. HI HOW INCREASING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL IT DOES SEEM REASONABLE -- TO FOLLOW THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION AND START SHIFTING TOWARDS MORE STATE STAFFORD FOR THESE TYPES OF FUNCTIONS WE JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S NO COMMENSURATE REDUCTION ON THE CONSULTING STAFF AND THE REASON. OF CREATED A FORTY FOR THAT IS THAT THEY EXPECTED TO BASICALLY WE ALLOCATE THIS CONSULTING CONTRACT FUNDS -- TO OTHER ACTIVITIES JUST WOULD NOTE THAT THE BUDGET THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THROUGH ITS OVERSIGHT PROCESS THAT THAT REALLY THE REDUCTION CONSULTING STAFF IS OCCURRING -- AS PLANNED AND AND AND JUST BE ABLE BUT MY FOCUS A LITTLE BIT LESS DIFFICULT AT LAST IT WAS EASY TO SORT OF MONITOR GIVEN THAT BUDGETING APPROACH. THANK YOU BERMAN FINANCE A NO COMMENT. RIGHT -- IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE. FOR SEEING NONE -- THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD OPEN SO WE'LL KEEP THAT -- ONE HOLD THAT IN ADVANCE AND UP -- DRESSER TO FUTURE MEETING. OUR NEXT DEPARTMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR THE PRESENTATIONS THIS MORNING. I WE HAVE A THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION NEXT ISSUE. FIVE ENERGY RESOURCES PROGRAM'S ACCOUNTS. WELCOME GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORNING DREW BONE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. THIS ITEM DEALS AS YOU NOTED SHARE WITH THE ENERGY RESOURCES PROGRAMS ACCOUNT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS HERBA. AND IT IS IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. HAS BEEN FOR A FEW YEARS. OVER THE LAST DECADE THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAVE BEEN INCREASING WE HAVE GOTTEN -- ABOUT SEVENTY NEW PEOPLE -- AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION BY OF THE LEGISLATURE. AT THE SAME TIME A REVENUES HAVE BEEN DECLINING. WHY IS THAT THERE'S TWO MAIN FACTORS THE FIRST IS BUYING THE METER SOLAR WE'VE BEEN? TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO IN INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. FACT WE HAVE EIGHT GIGAWATTS TODAY GIVE OR TAKE WHICH IS ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER THE STATE OF VERMONT. SO WE DON'T REALLY WELL THERE SECONDLY WE'VE DONE VERY WELL IN TERMS OF CONSERVATION WE ARE A PER CAPITA ELECTRICITY USAGE 44% BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND THAT'S DUE TO A WHOLE HOST OF FACTORS BUT AMONG THEM ARE THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S A PLANTS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS THAT DRIVE DOWN ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION. THESE TWO FACTORS TOGETHER -- HAVE CONSPIRED TO REDUCE OUR REVENUES THEY'VE BEEN GREAT FOR CALIFORNIANS IN TERMS OF REDUCING ENERGY BILLS THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT FOR HELPING US ACHIEVE OUR AIR QUALITY IN OUR CLIMATE GOALS BUT THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS SUFFERED BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR BUDGET. AND THIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN CONTRIBUTED OR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WHAT IS KEPT US AFLOAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BUILT A RESERVE. AND WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING DOWN THAT RESERVE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- LAST OVER THE LAST TWO BUDGET CYCLES WE HAVE REDUCED PRESSURE ON THIS -- BUT ACCOUNT BY TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH TO CLOSE THE DEFICIT ENTIRELY SO WERE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH A SUITE OF MEASURES THAT WILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT FURTHER. BY ANOTHER -- APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION DOLLARS -- IN THAT IS WHAT WE ASK TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU -- ANY QUESTIONS. IS THERE A REPORT FROM MILLIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RICH ROSS BROWN OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUT WE WE DO THINK THE PROPOSED PROPOSAL IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND CONTINUES ON SOME OF THE ACTIONS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ANNUAL DEFICIT ARPA. AND SO WE DID DO RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS THE PROPOSED CHANGES. WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THE PROPOSED CHANGES ONLY PARTIALLY ADDRESS THE ANNUAL DEFICIT. EVEN IF THOSE CHANGES ARE ADOPTED THEY'RE STILL -- THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS ROUGHLY SIX TO EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL DEFICIT -- GOING FORWARD AND SO -- UNDER THOSE PROJECTIONS THE FUND WOULD BE INSOLVENT AND TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE A BUDGET YEAR AND SO -- THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER TAKING SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIONS IN THE NEAR TERM A WE WANNA KINDA HIGHLIGHT A FEW EXAMPLES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION -- LAID OUT AS OPTIONS IN A REPORT THAT IT ISSUED EARLIER THIS YEAR FOR ADDITIONAL ACTIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIT. THOSE INCLUDE -- EXTENDING THE SURCHARGE THAT RAISES REVENUE TO BEHIND THE METER ELECTRICITY THAT'S ONE OF THE THE MAIN -- CAUSES OF OF THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IS THE DECREASE IN REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH -- ROOFTOP SOLAR BEHIND THE METER ELECTRICITY -- DIRECTING THE PC TO REMOVE THERE'S CURRENTLY A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER THE EPIC PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND THAT DOESN'T COVER ALL OF CECE'S CURRENT COST ADMINISTER THOSE PROGRAMS AND SO -- AT THE BUT KIND OF PICKS UP A PORTION OF THOSE COSTS AND SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD LOOK AT CAMP DIRECTING PC TO REMOVE THAT CAP SO THEY CAN FULLY REIMBURSED CC FOR THE COSTS -- ALL AS WELL AS LOOKING AT JUST -- FIFTEEN FUNDING SOURCES FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES ARE RECEIVE SUMMER BUT FUNDING FOR WATER EFFICIENCY ACTIVITIES AND SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD LOOK AT OTHER FUNDING SOURCES FOR EXAMPLE THE GENERAL FUND TO FUND THOSE. ACTIVITIES SO WE THINK IT -- THE LEGISLATURE MY ONE ASKS THE ADMINISTRATION'S REPORT ON THE FEES OF THE FEASIBILITY OF SOME OF THESE OPTIONS IN BUDGET HEARINGS. AND TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T TAKE ADDITIONAL ACTIONS TO FULLY ADDRESS THE DEFICIT -- WE RECOMMENDED A MINIMUM THEY DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO ISSUE ANOTHER ANOTHER REPORT IN PLAN NEXT YEAR TO FULLY ADDRESS THE ANNUAL DEFICIT -- AND SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN KIND OF HAVE THAT AVAILABLE IN FUTURE YEARS ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU PARIS FRANCE KATHY MACLEOD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU -- AND LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SIDE OF A ONE ONE SPEAK TO THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE -- THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO APPROVE -- WITH A PLACEHOLDER SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE -- THERE ARE ADDITIONAL ACTIONS IT'LL -- NEED TO BE TAKEN TO FULLY ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT HAS BEEN REFERENCE AND OF COURSE WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION -- TO A ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND WITH THAT IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE WITH A PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE. THE MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU. BLOOM HI FONG [inaudible] GARCIA [inaudible] MULLIN [inaudible] PATTERSON [inaudible] YES RIVAS. THANK YOU OUR NEXT ITEM IS -- ISSUE. SIX THE CPUC RESPONSE TO UTILITY -- BANKRUPTCY. AND THE GUY IN THE COURSE OF YOUR PRESENTATION IF YOU CAN JUST ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHY YOU CAN'T - ABSORB THE COST THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WITHIN YOUR CURRENT BUDGET THAT WOULD HELP EXPEDITE THINGS HELLO CHAIRMAN. AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME IS BERNARD AS A VETO. I AM THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES DIRECTOR FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TODAY I HAVE WITH ME MISTER JEFF ADDRESS. DRIVEN SIDE HERE TO DISCUSS ISSUE SIX PC RESPONSE UTILITY BANKRUPTCY AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING THANK CHAIRMAN JEFFORDS OF INSIDE FROM THE LEGAL DIVISION. THIS IF YOU SEE IS REQUESTING FUNDING FOR LEGAL SERVICES CONTRACT TO ADDRESS THE P. JEANNIE BACKUPS IN RELATED MATTERS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS. THE LEGAL SERVICES CONTRACT ISN'T UNANTICIPATED COST FOR ADVICE AND REPRESENTATION ON RESTRUCTURING FINANCE AND BANKRUPTCY MATTERS. AND TO YOUR POINT DE OF ABOUT OF SERVICES THAT WE ARE PRO CHOIR TO PAY FOR THESE SERVICES. IS TOO LARGE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE -- TO I THINK OBSERVER WITHOUT REQUESTING -- APPROVAL FOR THESE FUNDS. WE ARE ASKING FOR APPROVAL FOR THE FUNDS BECAUSE THE PC IS AN IMPORTANT STATE PARTY WAS STANDING IN A SIGNIFICANT ROLE TO PLAY. IN THE PGA BANKRUPTCY. THE CPC REGULATES MANY ASPECTS OF P. GENIES OPERATIONS INCLUDING ITS RATES ITS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE. AND SO WE NEED WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS SUCH AS CLEAN ENERGY. ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS. BECAUSE OF ITS ROLE OVERSEEING P. JEANNIE. ANY PLAN OF REORGANIZATION OR P. O. R. THAT IS PROPOSED IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. WOULD NEED TO BE APPROVED BY THE CPSC AS WELL AS THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AS IT WILL MOST CERTAINLY INVOLVED RATE MAKING ISSUES. AND ANY EXIT FINANCING WILL REQUIRE THAT AGENCIES APPROVAL. THE P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY IS A LARGE DOLLAR VALUE CASE AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX DEBT HOLDERS EQUITY HOLDERS WELL FOR VICTIMS AND OTHERS ARE ACTIVE IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. AND WILL BE THEMSELVES REPRESENTED BY EXPERT COUNSEL. BANKRUPTCY AND RESTRUCTURING ARE SPECIALIZED AREAS OF LEGAL PRACTICE AND IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THE CPC MUST THINK A SPECIALIZED. EXPERIENCE COUNSEL TO REPRESENT OUR INTEREST AS A REGULATOR. AS A RESULT THE CPUC MUST HAVE FUNDS IN ITS BUDGET TO PAY FOR EXPERT REPRESENTATION IN BANKRUPTCY COURT. COUNSEL FURTHER MUST BE ABLE TO RELY ON AN EXPERT ADVISOR TO EVALUATE THE COMPLEX FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS. AND TO MONITOR THE FLOW OF INFORMATION IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THE CONTRACT IS BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE PRIOR BANKRUPTCY WHERE WE SPENT APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TODAY'S FUNDS. I CAN ADDRESS ANY OF THESE POINTS IN MORE DETAIL OR ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE SO THAT -- THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR EXPECTATION -- AND THE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ASK YOUR TO IS THAT TWO MILLION DOLLAR -- DELTA IS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS TO ABSORB -- AND IT'S ONGOING OPERATION -- NO I THINK WE BASED THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PART ON A BACK OF THE ENVELOPE LOOK AT THE PRIOR PROCEEDING AND THAT ON SOME ESTIMATES THAT WE RECEIVED FROM OUR COUNCIL. A WE CAN'T SAY HOW MUCH. I DON'T THINK WE CAN PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY HOW MUCH THIS WILL END UP COSTING BUT RIGHT NOW WE FEEL THE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION. IS A REASONABLE AMOUNT. FINANCE I'M IN MY DEPARTMENT THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IS WHAT THE LAST BANKRUPTCY WOULD HAVE ADJUSTED TO IF IT WERE HAPPENING TODAY THAT'S NOT BE ESTIMATE OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF HOURS. AGAIN AN ESTIMATE THEY THINK THAT THIS -- THAT THIS PARTICULAR BANKRUPTCY WELL IN HER SO IT'S IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT APPLES AND ORANGES THERE BUT IT DOES GIVE YOU A REASONABLE NESS. OF THE AT THAT LEVEL OF EFFORT IT WAS NEED TO COMPARING THE LAST BANKRUPTCY TO THIS. ONE IS THIS ALL -- PREDICATED ON THE USING CUT OUTSIDE COUNSEL OR CEMEX OR I'M SORRY. OUR IS IS PREDICATED ON USING OUTSIDE COUNSEL OF VERSES IN HOUSE YES THIS IS PREDICATED ON USING OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND OUTSIDE FINANCIAL ADVISER. AN OUTSIDE COUNSEL ON THE BANKRUPTCY -- AND A FINANCIAL ADVISER ON THE AREAS FOCUS THE BANKRUPTCY FOR WHICH PC DOESN'T HAVE EXPERTISE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEIR EXISTING LOCAL COUNCILS ARE OUT OF THE PICTURE OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE EXTENSIVE S. EXPERTISE AND RATE MAKING WILL BE WORKING WITH THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL BUT BANKRUPTCY IS NOT. SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED HOUSE. UNDERSTOOD LA -- ANY COMMENTS YEAH -- I MEAN AS AS NOTED THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT AND EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY WILL BE NEEDED FOR THESE CONTRACTS SERVICES ARE WE DID LOOK AT THE ESTIMATES NAY SEEMS REASONABLE TO US ON WE DO WANT TO JUST KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THAT THE ESTIMATES ARE KIND OF OVER. A THREE YEAR PERIOD AS WELL SO THIS IS KIND ONE CHUNK OF MONEY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD -- IF THEY SORT OF FIND IN THE FUTURE YEAR THAT THING ACOSTA COMING IN HIGHER THAN THAT THEN THEY CAN. COME BACK FOR A REQUEST FOR SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY AT THAT TIME -- ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE -- JUST FOR THE COMMITTEES -- KNOWLEDGE THERE IS A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ASSOCIATED WITHOUT THIS ALLOCATION THAT RESTRICTS THE FUNDS JUST TO KIND OF THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART OF RELATED TO THE BANKRUPTCY CASE AND THEY WOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PC RELATED ACTIVITIES. ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. YOU'RE STANDING WE HAVE A HOLD OPEN RECOMMENDATION. SEEING NONE WE WILL -- WAIT. WE WILL HOLD SAFE MODE VOTE BUT WE'RE GONNA GET ONE COMMENT -- WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND TO TAKE ACTION AT A LATER MEETING AND OUR NEXT ITEM IS -- OF VARIOUS INVESTMENT REQUESTS -- MEMBER REQUESTS -- FOR INVESTMENT DOLLARS.

AND MS AGUIAR-CURRY. WE'RE ASKING GOD MEMBERS TO KEEP YOUR PRESENTATIONS TO ABOUT TWO MINUTES THANK YOU THE CLOCK ON THAT YOU'RE ALL CAPABLE OF THAT HELPING YOURSELF TO THAT TIME LIMIT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME SOME TIME TO PRESENT THIS YEAR I'M OFFERING NINE A. B. NINE FIFTY EIGHT WHICH CREATES A CALIFORNIA. ORGANIC TO SCHOOL PILOT PROGRAM THIS PILOT WILL ALLOW SCHOOLS TO APPLY FOR UP. TO FIFTEEN CENTS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING PER MEAL TO PURCHASE ORGANIC CALIFORNIA GROWN LOCAL FOOD. COSTS AND AVAILABILITY ISSUES PREVENT MANY COMMUNITIES FROM ACCESSING THESE HEALTHY FOODS BUT MEALS PROVIDE IN THE SCHOOL SETTING ARE A PRACTICAL WAY TO INCREASE CHILDREN'S NUTRITION. AND EXPOSED TO THESE A HOLE IN MINIMALLY PROCESSED FOODS IN ADDITION TO HAVING SCHOOLS PURCHASE ORGANIC FOOD THE PILOT WILL IDENTIFY BARRIERS THAT PREVENT SCHOOLS FROM EX ASSESS ACCESSING. ORGANIC AND FACILITATE ACTIVITIES THE SIR TO MAKE THE SHIFT. TOGETHER WITH A BROAD RANGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND EDUCATION SUPPORTERS I REQUEST A TWO MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS FOR THIS PROGRAM. TO BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE OFFICE OF FARM TO FORK WITHIN CDFA. WITH THIS FUNDING THE SECRETARY WILL BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER THE PILOT AND THE PROVIDE AT LEAST FIVE GRANTS TO SCHOOLS THE GRANT MONEY WILL MAKE COVER THE PREMIUM ACOSTA PURCHASING CALIFORNIA GROWN ORGANIC FOODS. BUT MAY NOT REPLACE FEDERAL FUNDING BY RECORD REQUIRING A REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WE'LL BE ABLE TO REVIEW THE CHALLENGES THE BENEFITS. AND THEN USE THIS INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER INVESTING IN PROVIDING KIDS A HEALTHY LOCAL AND ORGANIC FOOD MONEY IS WELL SPENT. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. FOR INCLUDING THIS IN YOUR BUDGET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION NEXT UP WE HAVE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU. OF FOLLOWED BY -- O'DONNELL RIVAS AND OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES -- I'M HERE TO REQUEST SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO HELP US TRANSITION FROM DIRTY DIESEL SCHOOL BUSES TO CLEAN ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES. IN OUR STATE WE HAVE ALMOST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSES ON A ROAD. MOST OF WHICH ARE DIRTY OIL -- OLDER DIESEL FUEL MODELS THAT WILL SOON AGE OUT OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE SPENT -- THESE ARE MODELS THAT -- CAUSE RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND WORSEN EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA AND PARTICULARLY IMPACT CHILDREN WHOSE LUNGS ARE STILL DEVELOPING. NATIONALLY IT'S ESTIMATED -- THAT THEY'RE OVER FIVE POINT THREE TONS MILLION TONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES EMITTED EVERY YEAR BY THESE DIRTY SCHOOL BUSES. WE ALL KNOW THAT CLEAN ELECTRICAL BUSES WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH THE HEALTH YOUR COMMUTE. THEY WILL ALSO OFFER VALUABLE SAVINGS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY THESE BUSES ARE A MUCH MORE VIABLE COST EFFECTIVE OPTION AND IN FACT THE OVER THE LIFETIME OF AN AVERAGE SCHOOL BUS. EACH OF THESE BUSES COULD SAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN REDUCED FUEL AND MAINTENANCE COSTS COMPARED TO THEIR DIESEL COUNTERPARTS THE CHALLENGES. THE UP FRONT COST FOR THESE BUSES ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS -- ALLEGED BUSES CAN ALSO PROVIDE ELECTRIC GRID AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY DISCHARGING ENERGY AT CRITICAL MOMENTS. I AND I'LL JUST MENTION AS A DATA POINT. IN THE TWIN RIVERS SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SACRAMENTO WHICH IS MOVING TOWARD AN ALL ELECTRIC BUS FLEET. EVERY MILE DRIVEN BY AN ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUS COST LESS THAN TWENTY CENTS PER MILE WHERE IS A STANDARD DIESEL MODEL COSTS AROUND EIGHTY CENTS PER MILE. SO WITH THAT -- WE'VE A BUDGET ASK OF SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- AS PART OF A BROADER ASKED THAT I KNOW AROUND CLEANER TRANSPORTATION AND VERY MUCH HOPE THAT CLEAN SCHOOL BUSES WILL BE PART OF THIS AND WITH THAT TO APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER TO MISTER O'DONNELL EUROPE NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD -- GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT MY BUDGET REQUEST TODAY I AM REQUESTING BE ALLOCATED TO OUR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FROM THIS FISCAL YEAR THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD FUND A WIDE VARIETY OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT USED BY THE IN VARIOUS APPLICATIONS BOTH ON AND OFF ROAD. THIS INCLUDES FREIGHT TRUCKS TRANSIT BUSES PORT EQUIPMENT AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT AND ACTUALLY SCHOOL BUSES AS WELL WHICH WE JUST HEARD ABOUT. THE STATE IS WORK DILIGENTLY TO COMBAT TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ACROSS MANY PLATFORMS AND WE HAVE MADE SOME GREAT PROGRESS. UNFORTUNATELY STATEWIDE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ARE STILL ON THE RISE AND MANY COMMUNITIES STILL SUFFER FROM HARMFUL POLLUTION AND POOR AIR QUALITY. IF WE TRULY WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING OUR CLIMATE GOALS THEN WE MUST DELIVER THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO TRANSFORM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR SECTOR. THAT IS THE PLACE TO ADDRESS THIS IN OTHER WORDS WE NEED TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS AND ALSO WHERE THE POLLUTION IS. WE NEED TO DEDICATE MORE FUNDING TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE YET STILL EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGY TODAY WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT ONGOING FUNDING IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE STATE'S OVERALL STRATEGY FOR USING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT NEW TECHNOLOGIES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE SHOULD NOT JUST REGULATE BUT WE SHOULD AND OF EIGHT THIS MONEY WILL DO THIS. FOR EXAMPLE FLEET OPERATORS LOOKING TO PURCHASE NEW TECHNOLOGIES MY SCHEDULE THE RETIREMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THEIR EXISTING VEHICLES -- SEVERAL YEARS AHEAD SIMILARLY FLEET MANUFACTURES NEED SEVERAL YEARS TO IMPLEMENT A SERIES OF INVESTMENTS WHEN BRINGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO MARKET. IS EXPONENTIAL ESSENTIAL THAT THE STATE LINES IT'S FUNNY INCENTIVES TO THESE BUSINESS CYCLES TO PROVIDE CERTAIN CERTAINLY THAT INVESTMENTS WILL BE AVAILABLE. THIS BUDGET ALLOCATION REPRESENTS A CRITICAL DOWN PAYMENT TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE STATE'S NEAR TERM AND LONGER TERM CLIMATE CHANGE IN AIR QUALITY GOALS -- THERE ARE NUMBER OF MEMBER OTHER MEMBERS IT ALSO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST I KNOW SOME REMEMBER RACE WAS GOING TO BE HERE TODAY BUT IS PRESENTING OF LEAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE ISSUES SUPPORT AS WELL. AND I THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] MR RIVAS. CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU AND I'M HERE TODAY -- TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FIVE MILLION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION TO FIND THE REGIONAL ECONOMIES IN EQUITY IN AGRICULTURAL LAND PROGRAM OTHERWISE AND IS THE REAL PROGRAM -- ESSENTIALLY THIS PROGRAM IS ABOUT CREATING OPPORTUNITY -- NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIALLY -- THE DISADVANTAGE FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO GAIN ACCESS TO AGRICULTURAL LAND -- THE REAL PROGRAM WOULD CREATE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE AGRICULTURAL LAND -- SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICAL IN IN IN THIS STATE -- THAT LOSES AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND RANGE THAT PER YEAR -- SUCH LOSSES POSE A SERIOUS THREAT TO AGRICULTURE AND CERTAINLY TO OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIES AND STATEWIDE FOOD. PRODUCTION -- NOW THIS PROGRAM THE REAL PROGRAM WOULD -- PROTECT AGRICULTURAL LAND AND SURE IT IS ASSESSABLE TO SOCIALLY -- DISADVANTAGE FARMERS AND RANCHERS THROUGH OWNERSHIP OR LONG TERM LEASES THROUGH FREE TITLE ACQUISITION AN AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION EASEMENTS ADDITIONALLY THE REAL ACT ESTABLISHES AN EQUITABLE -- ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO AWARD GRANTS A SOCIALLY -- THE DISADVANTAGE FARMERS THE GRANTS HELP FARMERS WITH DOWN PAYMENTS INTEREST RATE ASSISTANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR LAND IMPROVEMENT. THIS FUNDING WOULD CERTAINLY HELP SOCIALLY -- THE DISADVANTAGE THE THE DISADVANTAGE FARMERS AND RANCHERS WHILE SAFEGUARDING THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE STATE WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SO MANY REGIONS -- IN OUR STATE SO I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND REQUEST -- TO FIND THE REAL ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION. THANK RESEARCHER THANK YOU MISTER AVIS [inaudible] MR OBERNOLTE. GOOD MORNING. MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALMOST AFTERNOON. I REPRESENT. OF THE VERY SMALL COMMUNITY AND DISADVANTAGED MEDIA BIG BEAR LAKE IT'S WERE USED TO BE THE MAYOR BEFORE BEING ELECTED TO THIS JOB IT'S SMALL COMMUNITY AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN 1100% OF THE WATER FOR THAT COMMUNITY COMES FROM GROUND WATER. BOB RIGHT NOW THAT WATER IS TREATED UP TO A MINIMUM STANDARD WHEN IT'S COLLECTED AND THEN PIPED OFF THE MOUNTAIN -- IS WASTE WATER. 1100% OF BIG BEAR'S OUR WATER COMES IN THE FORM OF RAINFALL AND SNOWFALL THAT'S THE ONLY THING THEY CAN REPLENISH THE GROUNDWATER SO OBVIOUSLY -- PIPING ALL OF THIS WATER OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN IS NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE -- THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REQUEST FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR TERTIARY WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT THAT WOULD TREAT THAT WATER UP TO A LEVEL SUFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO BE PUT INTO THE LAKE AND EVENTUALLY PERCOLATED BACK INTO THE GROUND WATER. THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A VERY INNOVATIVE WAY TO ALSO -- SATISFIED BAR MENTAL STEWARDSHIP GOALS THE WATER WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE STANFIELD MARCH WHICH IS A SANCTUARY FOR MIGRATORY WATERFALL AND ALSO THROUGH PERCOLATION PONDS THAT BENEFIT A NUMBER OF OTHER -- THREATENED SPECIES INCLUDING THE LARGEST -- POPULATION OF WINTERING BALD EAGLES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO I THE COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY THAT THE MODERN IN THE REQUEST IS ABOUT FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PLANT OTHER COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN SECURING. OF LOCAL AND FEDERAL FUNDS TO FOR ABOUT HALF OF THAT SO IF THE STATE TO COME UP WITH THE OTHER TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE COULD DO SOMETHING THAT. IS REALLY INNOVATIVE HERE THAT NOT ONLY SATISFIES SEVERAL OF THE STATE'S PRIORITIES OF OF INCREASING -- RESILIENCY OF GROUNDWATER IN RENEWABLE WATER BUT ALSO I ADMIRE MIDDLE STEWARDSHIP SO I'D RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT WITH THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] THE STROLLER. FOLLOWED BY MS KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I ACTUALLY HAVE THREE REQUESTS. TO MAKE A TO YOU TODAY -- FIRST IS THE GAME ARE MARKED YOU STILL ONLY HAVE TO THE SAME TWO MINUTES EVERYBODY ELSE I APPRECIATE THAT I'LL GET IT ORDERED INSPECT ME TO BE FAIR AND BENEVOLENT. AS ALWAYS -- I'M ASKING FOR TWO POINT ONE MILLION FOR THE CITY OF CLAREMONT TO FUND A PILOT PROGRAM TO CREATE A LOCALLY OWNED NONPROFIT SOLAR. PANEL ASSEMBLY FACTORY. KIND OF PROJECT THAT YOU WOULD SEE MAYBE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SANTA MONICA [inaudible] AND BAKERSFIELD. OF THE CITY OF CLAREMONT LOCAL COLLEGES THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS AND RESIDENTS OF POMONA OR JOINING TOGETHER. WITH THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION COMMUNITY HOME ENERGY RETROFIT PROJECT. TO BUILD A SOLAR PANEL PROGRAM OR FACTORY THAT EMPLOYEES AND SERVES THE PEOPLE OF CLAREMONT AND MONA. THE PANELS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AND COST LESS THAN MOST SOLAR PANELS SO TODAY AND BECAUSE THEY ARE MANUFACTURED BY A NONPROFIT WILL NOT MARK UP TO TURN A PROFIT. THIS WILL BE THE WORLD'S FIRST REPLICABLE NONPROFIT SOLAR PANEL ASSEMBLY FACTORY THEY CAN BRING BACK MIDDLE CLASS MANUFACTURING JOBS. ADDRESS OR VINYL OF OUR MIDDLE JUSTICE ISSUES AND CUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT THE SAME TIME. THE FUNDS WILL GO TOWARDS ALL EQUIPMENT MACHINES TOOLS MATERIALS AND HIRING NEEDED TO BUILD A FACTORY. THAT CAN PRODUCE FIFTY THOUSAND PANELS A YEAR. THE SECOND REQUESTED FOR THE CITY OF PASADENA SIGN MONUMENT. A LANDMARK OF THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA MY DISTRICT HAS BEEN THE MONUMENT SIGN. A LARGE SIGN NESTED IN THE HILL IT'S BESIDE THE ONE TEN FREEWAY. THE SIGN IS MADE OF THE NATIVE A ROYAL STONE AND READ CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA. IT WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND WAS A SOURCE OF PRIDE BUT IT RECENTLY HAS BEEN OVERTAKEN BY BRUSH AND OTHER SIGNS OF WEAR AND TEAR. THE BRUSHES AND CALTRANS RIGHT AWAY BUT IS NOT CLEARED REGULATE DESPITE REQUEST BY THE CITY. THE CITY'S PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT AND VOLUNTEERS HAVE DONE WHAT THEY CAN TO MAINTAIN IT BUT THE YEARS HAVE TAKEN ITS TOLL. THAT IS WHY I REQUEST IN ONE TIME FUNDING OF NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO RESTORE THE ICONIC SIGN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND ON GOING. TO MAINTAIN BRUSH CLEARANCE. STUDENTS TRANSIT PASS. STUDENT LIFE IS INHERENTLY UNSTABLE IS THE SUBJECT OF FLUCTUATING INCOMES. INCONSISTENCY GOGGLES AND A PREDICTABLE EXPENDITURES OFTENTIMES RESTRICTING FUNDS FOR TRANSPORTATION. ALTHOUGH SUBSIDIZE STUDENT TRANSIT PASS PROGRAMS ARE COMMON AMONG SCHOOLS AND TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES A STATEWIDE FUNDING SOURCE WILL STABILIZE POSTER AND EXPAND THESE PROGRAMS. GUARANTEEING AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WILL RELIEVE FINANCIAL STRESS. OPEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL GROWTH AND INCREASE RIDERSHIP OF ALL THE WHILE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AS WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TO HELP TRANSIT AGENCIES FUND THESE PROGRAMS AND OFFSET THE COSTS. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMISSION'S CONSIDERATION OF THESE THREE REQUESTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SHE AT THE AND MS KAMAGRA OF THANK YOU GOOD. AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM REQUESTING A TEN MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS THIS MUSEUM HAS BEEN A CRITICAL RESOURCE AND THE FOUNDATION FOR CULTURAL SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. AND RESEARCH NOT ONLY FOR LA IN CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE WORLD. THE FUNDS WILL GO TOWARDS THE FIRST PHASE OF THE EXPANSION PROJECT WHICH WILL UPDATE AND RE ORIENT THE MUSEUM'S ENTRANCE INTO EXPOSITION PARK. AND TO CREATE A STRONGER CONNECTION TO OTHER AREA INSTITUTIONS AND PROVIDE MORE CONVENIENT ACCESS FOR THE COMMUNITY AND OTHER VISITORS. IT -- IS WEDDED. BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM WITH THE LUCAS MUSEUM NOT FAR BEHIND AND SO. THIS IS PART OF AN APPROPRIATION REQUEST TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT IT MAINTAINS ITS VISIBILITY AND ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF CULTURAL EXHIBITIONS -- AND TO DO THE KIND OF RESOURCE A RESEARCH THAT WE'VE COME TO ADAM NEED FROM THEM. EARLIER THIS WEEK THE UNITED NATIONS REPORTED THAT A MILLION SPECIES ARE AT RISK OF EXTINCTION. IN THIS EVER CHANGING WORLD IT'S EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL THAT MUSEUM SUCH AS A NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM. USER UNIQUE RESOURCES AND POTENTIALS TO PROMOTE AND FOSTER THE BEST CULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IDEALS OF OUR STATE AND COUNTRY. I SHOULD ADD THAT THE MUSEUM CONDUCTS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE MILLION SPECIMENS DATING BACK FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION YEARS. IT HAS EXHIBITIONS RANGING FROM THE NEW DINOSAUR HALL -- BOASTING TWENTY COMPLETE DINOSAURS TO THE BECOMING LA EXHIBIT IT ALSO TRACKED -- THE MOUNTAIN LION P. FORTY SEVEN BEFORE IT SUCCUMBED -- TO DEATH THROUGH RHODEN SIDE AND IT'S CURRENTLY SERVES ONE POINT THREE MILLION VISITORS AND THEY ESTIMATE THAT THE EXPANSION WOULD ALLOW THE MUSEUM TO SERVE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATRONS EACH YEAR. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THIS FUNDING TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF A ONE OF A KIND SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL DESTINATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU YOU THE COLLECTED TO NOTE THAT THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IS ALSO THE HOME -- OF AUGUST IN A LAW OFFICE MORE SEE THE CALIFORNIA STATE DINOSAUR THANK YOU I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO ADD THAT AS YOU HAD DONE ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE SAME REASONS -- I THINK THE MISTER PATTERSON YOU HAVE -- PRISON TASTED LIKE MAKE. NOW WOULD BE THE TIME AND OF THEM WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT TO IF THERE'S NO OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE PRESENTING. THANK THANK MISTER APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AT THREE TO PRESENT I'M GONNA TRY TO MAKE HIM. A QUICK AS MY UP -- COLLEAGUE GUESS -- MISSED MR HOLDEN DEAD SO HERE WE GO OUT THERE TO RELATED. ASKED TO PRESENT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE DAY WITH RESPECT CAL FIRE THE FIRST IS A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE APPROPRIATE FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO CAL FIVE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESEARCH. THIS MONEY WOULD ALLOW CAL FIRE TO OFFER GRANTS TO SCHOOLS OF THE CSU SYSTEM TO STUDY AND PUBLISH FINDINGS. ON THE PHYSICAL MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL TOLL THAT LONG INTENSE FIRE SEASONS TAKE ON FIREFIGHTERS IN THE WILD LAND IN THE WILDLAND URBAN. INTERFACE -- WE KNOW THAT MANY MANY FIRE FIGHTERS IN THIS. NEW ERA I JUST WORK HOURS AND HOURS DAYS ON END -- THIS MEANS THEY DON'T GET ADEQUATE REST THERE'S NUTRITIONAL ISSUES UP BATHROOM BREAK ISSUES AND MUCH MUCH MORE BUT ADDITIONALLY THERE. EXPOSED TO HARMFUL POLLUTANTS -- FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE FIRE -- BUT THAT SO FAR THE STATE I THINK HAS FAILED ADEQUATELY TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND -- THESE DIFFICULTIES AND FIREFIGHTERS IN THESE SITUATIONS -- I HAVE MANY CAL FIRE AB MEMBERS THAT RESIDE IN SEVERAL CALIFORNIA WHO FIGHT FIRES UP AND DOWN STATE. AND THEY ARE STRESSED AND AS I'VE NEVER SEEN AND MANY OF THEM ARE FRIENDS OF MINE. THAT I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. OBVIOUSLY THE TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF THE FIRES LIKE A CAMPFIRE THEY GET NO SLEEP THEY'RE BATTLING THIS BLAZE IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO STAY ON THE FIRE LINE FOR DAYS. ON END. AND SO WE WERE WERE ASKING -- IT IS POLICY MAKERS THAT WE TRY TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE DEMANDS WE PLACE ON OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS TO AND SIDE EFFECTS OF THESE.
