THE US SUPREME COURT RECENTLY PILED ON AND TOLD THE IN SITU WAY THAT THEIR MONOPOLISTIC PLAQUE PRACTICES ARE NO LONGER LAWFUL ANY NCQA FOLDED ON JULY FIRST THEY ELIMINATED THEIR RESTRICTIONS ON NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS RIGHTS WE CHANGE THE WORLD OF COLLEGE SPORTS FOR THE BETTER WE CHALLENGE THE ON THEIR EXPLOITATION OF STUDENT ATHLETES. BUT TODAY WE NEED TO PASS SB TWENTY SIX. TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA'S NOT DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE LAWS IN FOURTEEN OF THE STATES. THAT COPIED US OR GOING INTO EFFECT RIGHT NOW. WE ALSO NEED S. B. TWENTY SIX TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF OUR STUDENT ATHLETES SO COLLEGES CAN'T MAKE UP THEIR OWN RULES. AND TO PROTECT OUR- COLLEGES BECAUSE WE BUILT INTO THIS LAW PROTECTIONS FOR THE COLLEGES SO THAT THE STUDENT ATHLETES COULD NOT TAKE. CONTRACTS THAT WOULD BE IN CONFLICT. WITH CONTRACTS THE COLLEGE HAD. SO THERE ARE TWO AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN SINCE WE'VE SEEN THE BILL ONE IT'S NOW URGENCY TO IMPLEMENT R. N. I. L. WRITES ON SEPTEMBER FIRST. RATHER THAN JANUARY FIRST AGAIN TWO SO WE ARE NOT AT A DISADVANTAGE. TO OTHER STATES. DANTE IT INCLUDES WE'VE INCLUDED COMMUNITY COLLEGES NOW. BECAUSE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORKING GROUP. RECOMMENDED THAT THEY BE INCLUDED AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE UPPORTS.

IN A GAME AND NOT HAVE A WINTER COLD TO WEAR OF THE SCHOOL FOR TIM THAT JUST. TWO WEEKS AGO WE ALL WITNESSED THE OLYMPIC THAT'S CLEARLY THE QUINTESSENTIAL AMATEUR- SUPPORT- THE AROUND THE WORLD BUT- HOW MANY KNOW THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ATHLETES THOSE PREMIER ATHLETES. ARE PAID. THEY ARE PROFESSIONALS AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO COMPETE FOR THEIR COUNTRIES AND WHAT WAS CLEARLY. AMATEURISM FOR ALL OVER A- WOMAN'S TWO HUNDRED YEARS NOW MOST OF THE ELITE ATHLETES OR PROFESSIONAL FROM SKATEBOARDING. TO TEN TO GOLF TO TRACK AND FIELD MOST OF THEM ARE MILLIONAIRES BUT THESE COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE NOT AFFORDED THIS RIGHT. IN MANY ARE UNAWARE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE ATHLETES LESS THAN 10% EVER PLAY PROFESSIONAL SPORTS THEIR TIME TO SHINE IS IN COLLEGE SO THIS AFFORDS THEM- THE RIGHT OF ANYONE ELSE TO OWN THEIR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY SAYS INCLUDES NOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE MANY- ATHLETES GET THEIR START AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE BEFORE GOING ON TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. SO I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR SUPPORTING I SPEAK TO ALL SIX TWO YEARS AGO AND- MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY WILL TELL YOU WHEN IT LEFT OUR ASSEMBLY FLOOR SENATE FLOOR AND ONE OR TWO CERTAINLY WHEN WE WERE ON SUMMER BREAK.

ASSEMBLY BILL SIX SIXTEEN BY FAMILY MEMBERS DOWN AN ACT RELATING TO LABOR RELATIONS CENTER LEVEL FLOORS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS IT IS MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY A. B. SIX ONE SIX. MEMBERS WHEN EACH OF US VOTES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO DO THAT SOME OF US WILL GO TO THE POLLS TO CAST HER BALLOT. OTHERS WILL MAIL IT IN SOME CALIFORNIANS WILL NEED HELP FILLING OUT THEIR BALLOT WELL OTHERS OF US WILL DROP IT OFF BEFORE ELECTION DAY. WE HAVE CHOICES THE CALIFORNIA VOTING CHOICE ACT GAVE US THOSE CHOICES CHOICES THAT DID NOT EXIST IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHEN CALIFORNIA GAVE FARM WORKERS THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN UNION REPRESENTATION ELECTIONS. MEMBERS AV SIX ONE SIX IS THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS VOTING CHOICE ACT. IT MODERNIZES SECRET BALLOT ELECTIONS FOR FARM WORKERS BY GIVING THEM OPPORTUNITIES TO VOTE TO MANY OF THE SAME WAYS THAT EACH OF US HAVE WHEN WE VOTE MEMBERS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THOUGHT THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR DR. THANK YOU- I RISE TO SUPPORT- A. B. SIX ONE SIX- THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SOME OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL HAVE ASSERTED THAT. THIS IS ACTUALLY A CARD CHECK. BUT LET'S PUT ASIDE THE FACT THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE AND I JUST WANT YOU TO CONSIDER ONE OTHER ISSUE. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA TEACHERS FIREFIGHTERS POLICE OFFICERS HOME CARE WORKERS CLERKS RESEARCHERS WHETHER THEY WORK FOR THE STATE A CITY COUNTY OR SPECIAL DISTRICT EVERY CALIFORNIAN UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD HAS HAD THE RIGHT TO JOIN A UNION BY USING A CARD CHECK PROCESS SINCE TWENTY TWELVE. SO IF BY CHANCE YOU THINK THAT THE CAR CHECK IS DEFACTO DENIAL OF A SECRET BALLOT THEN WOULD YOU REALLY WANT TO REPEAL THAT RIGHT THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING IS PLEASE DON'T USE THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN CIRCULATED TO TRY AND JUSTIFY VOTING AGAINST A. B. SIX ONE SIX I SINCERELY. HOPE YOU VOTE AND SUPPORT THIS URGENT LIBEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER GROVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- THE F. W. THE AUTHOR AND THE FLOOR MANAGER OF THIS BILL OF ARGUING THAT THIS DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE WORKERS RIGHT TO SECRET BALLOT- AND THAT THE BILL WOULD NOT ALLOW FOR A UNION MEMBER TO FILL OUT THE BALLOT ON BEHALF OF THE WORKER IN TURN IT IN. BUT I'D LIKE TO DIRECT YOU TO THE LANGUAGE- IN THE CODE SECTION ONE ONE FIVE SIX POINT THREE FIVE AC THREE THE SIGNATURE OF THE PERSON WITNESSING THAT THE EMPLOYEE SIGNED THE BALLOT CARD OR ASSISTING THEM TO FILL IT OUT OR THE BALLOT CARD OR BOTH AND THEN ON SECTION FOUR THERE'S A SECTION IN THERE THAT SAYS THE BALLOT CARD SHALL BE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO THE OFFICE OF THEBOARD IN AN ENVELOPE PROVIDED BY THE BOARD OR MAIL TO THE BOARD OFFICE- IN IN THAT CAN BE PROVIDED- BY AN INDIVIDUAL THAT'S COLLECTING THAT BALLOT THIS. BILL CONCERNS ME DRASTICALLY WE HAVE THE TOP THREE AGRICULTURE PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD WE ALL KNOW THAT FARM WORKERS. ARE ESSENTIAL COG IN THE WHEEL IN ORDER TO CREATE FOOD SECURITY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT BY REPLACING THE CURRENT WAY THAT EMPLOYEES ARE EXCUSE ME THAT THAT FARM WORKERS VOTE BY SECRET BALLOT. TOO MUCH LESS PRIVATE REPRESENTATION- AND APPORTION. AND PLEASE DON'T BE NAIVE TO THINK THAT THINGS LIKE THIS DON'T HAPPEN. THEY CAN BE PRESSURED BULLIED AND EVEN ATTACKED BY U. S. W. AND THEIR MEMBERS. WE WITNESS THIS FIRST HAND WITH THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE GRAMMAR AND FARM WORKERS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LRB IN THE U. F. W. I CAN TELL YOU THAT YEARS. SIX YEARS. OF GATHERING SIGNATURES ON PETITIONS BY SYLVIA LOPEZ AT A LOCAL FARM WORKER IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT TIME WAS NOT INTIMIDATING SHE'S ALL OF FIVE FEET TALL. SHE WENT OUT AND GATHERED SIGNATURES OF PEOPLE TO DECERTIFY THE U. F. W. WANTED TWENTY YEAR ELECTION THE DID NOT- EVEN TAKE PART IN THE TWENTY YEARS THAT THEY WERE. ASSESSED TO HAVE THE CONTRACT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE SIGNATURE PROCESS WAS D. SIR- DISMISSED TWICE BY THE ADMINISTRATION THE LRB. I CAN TELL YOU THAT COURT CASES AFTER COURT CASES AND FINALLY A CERTIFIED ELECTION. THAT WAS TAKEN AND OVERSIGHT SEEN BY THEN. THE D. I. R.THE ADMINISTRATION THE CURRENT D. I. R. V. IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THAT SHE WAS ON THE GROUND THERE AND EVEN THAT ELECTION THE ADMINISTRATION LOCKED UP THOSE BALLOTS FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE THOSE VOTES COULD EVEN BE COUNTED DURING THAT FIVE YEAR PROCESS FARM WORKERS WERE ATTACKED THEIR TIRES WERE SLASHED THEIR CARS WERE KEYED THEIR HOMES WERE VANDALIZED AND THEIR CHILDREN WERE STOCKED WHEN THEY WENT TO SCHOOL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THESE THINGS ARE REAL AND IT HAPPENS TO ELIMINATE OR TO NOT JUST ALLOW A SECRET BALLOT VOTE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD KEEP THEIR VOTE PRIVATE JUST LIKE WE DO IN THE ELECTION PROCESS WE KEEP OUR VOTE PRIVATE YOU WALK INTO THAT VOTING BOOTH YOU MAIL YOUR BALLOT- ALL THE WAYS THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE IT'S ALL PRIVATE. AND WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE ASSIST US IF WE NEED ASSISTANCE BUT YOU STILL RETAIN. HARVESTING I CAN TELL YOU AFTER SIX YEARS OF A COURT BATTLE THE VICTORY CAME TO THE FARM WORKERS WHEN THE BALLOTS WERE FINALLY COUNTED AFTER A JUDGE ORDERED THEM TO BE COUNTED COUNTED AND THE VOTE WAS ONE THOUSAND NINETY EIGHT FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE OF THE- UNION CONTRACT BY SECRET BALLOT AND A HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN. TO KEEP IT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE SIX YEARS THAT THESE FARM WORKERS WERE IT WAITED FOR JUSTICE WAS JUST HORRENDOUS ON THEM AND THEIR PERSONAL LIVES I AM GETTING A CROSS PICKET LINES EVERY SINGLE DAY FROM FARM WORKERS THAT WERE- PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT REALLY FARM WORKERS THAT WERE PAID TO BE THERE- IN PAID ON THE SIDELINES. IT'S JUST HORRENDOUS AND I THINK THAT PUTTING OUR FARM WORKERS IN JEOPARDY IS JUST ONE REASON THIS BIT THIS BILL SHOULD NOT PASS AGAIN OUR FARM WORKERS ARE AN INTEGRAL COG IN THE WHEEL FOR OUR FOOD SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF FOOD PRODUCTS AND TO PUT THEM UNDER THIS TYPE OF PRESSURE. COUNTLESS FARM WORKERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR NOT FOR THIS AND I WOULD ASK YOUR NO VOTE SENATOR GLACIER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TODAY- WITH- I DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU NOW. IT'S EASY TO- CHARACTERIZE THE DEBATE TODAY AS PRO UNION OR ANTI UNION AND I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING OF THE KIND. IF THE BILL BEFORE US WAS ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROTECT THE RIGHT OF THE UNIONS FOR FAIR AND FREE ELECTIONS. OF OUR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS I'D BE STANDING WITH ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT THOSE RIGHTS. BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY AND I ASK YOU THIS QUESTION IF THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM WAS BEFORE YOU AND GAVE THE SAME RIGHTS IN THAT BILL TO THE EMPLOYER THAT THEY COULD CIRCULATE A PETITION THAT THEY COULD GET A SECRET BALLOT IN THIS FORMAT THAT'S PROVIDED FOR THIS BILL TO DECERTIFY A UNION WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT LEGISLATION SAME RULES BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO APPLY IT TO THE EMPLOYER NOT JUST TO. THE EMPLOYEE FOR THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO REPRESENT THE EMPLOYEE AND I WOULD SUGGEST YOU THAT MANY OF YOU WOULD HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ALLOWING FOR THE DECERTIFICATION OF A UNION UNDER THOSE TERMS. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THIS CHAMBER. PROTECTING THE SANCTITY OF THE BALLOT BOX. IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND CERTAINLY THIS YEAR YOU'LL SEE AND HEAR AND PASS MANY BILLS PROTECTING THE RIGHT OF THE BALLOT BOX THE SECRET BALLOT MAKING SURE THAT- VOTER CAN CAST THEIR VIEWS- WITH PROTECTIONS. BUT I SUGGEST TO YOU THAT THE BILL BEFORE YOU WOULD ELIMINATE THAT ASSESS FOR FARM WORKERS YOU CAN HAVE AN ELECTION WHERE THERE ARE FOLKS THAT WE ARE PART OF THE AT THE REPRESENTED CLASS THAT'S BEING PROPOSED THAT WOULD NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THE ELECTION DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT EVERYBODY GET A BALLOT IT'S A SELECTIVE GROUP THEY CAN GET A BALLOT. AND WHETHER IT'S DONE BY A UNION OR THE EMPLOYER I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. WILLIAM GOULD WHO IS- PROFESSOR EMERITUS AT STANFORD LAW SCHOOL AND FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD I WROTE A PIECE ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION AND- THE IT'S CAPTURED IN THE HEADLINE FARMWORKERS DESERVE DEMOCRATIC PROTECTIONS. AND HE GOES ON TO SAY IN THE IN THE IN THE PIECE THAT THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD IS THE APPROPRIATE NEUTRAL PARTY TO HANDLE THIS RESPONSIBILITY NOT PRIVATE PARTIES SINCE. WE HAVE A PROCESS TO ENSURE FAIR ELECTIONS IN OUR FIELDS. WE WANT TO HAVE FAIR ELECTIONS. IN THE FIELDS BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. I THINK THAT THE BILL BEFORE US AS THE BEST OF INTENTIONS BUT IT DOES IT IN A WAY THAT UNDERCUTS OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES OF FEDERAL ACTIONS FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST THE SELECTED FEW AND MEMBERS WANT TO GET THIS BILL WAS BEFORE YOU GIVEN THE SAME RIGHTS TO THE EMPLOYER TO DECERTIFY I THINK WE WOULD ALL HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT OF EXPRESSING HERE TODAY ACCORDINGLY I WOULD RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON A. B. SIX SIXTEEN. SENATOR BURGESS. MADAM PRESIDENT I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP SOME VERY IMPORTANT POINTS SO I WON'T. RECITE. THEM IN TOO MUCH DETAIL THIS IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE ISSUE FOR MANY YEARS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT- VOTER PROTECTION IN FRANCHISE MEANT WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR TO OUR TO OUR AMERICAN SYSTEM OR OR FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IF YOU BELIEVE IN VOTER PROTECTION IN THE SANCTITY OF THE VOTE DISCLOSING AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE INFLUENCE INTIMIDATED THREATENED THAT'S ANATHEMA TO WHAT WE STAND FOR. SO COLLEAGUES- I'D HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE FORMER PRESENTER THIS IS NOT A FULLY BAKED IDEA IT DESERVES A LOT MORE REVIEW A LOT MORE EXAMINATION BECAUSE I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME PASS FORWARD BUT UNDER ITS CURRENT FORM THIS IS AN ON DEMOCRATIC PIECE OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE. AND ASK THE AUTHOR TO REVISIT THIS WITH MORE INDIVIDUALS- AT THE TABLE MORE STAKEHOLDERS- TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO VOTE AND TO VOTE SAFELY. SENATOR NIELSEN OKAY MADAM PRESIDENT LAYS DOWN ON THE SENATE HIRED YOUR NO VOTE AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I HAVE DEALT WITH SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IT'S BEEN AROUND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN NOW YOU DON'T IF YOU WANT TO USE ME FOR MYSTICALLY NOT CALL A CARD CHECK THAT'S OKAY BUT IT IS NOT DEMOCRATIC IT ALLOWS AN INTERMEDIATE PARTY A PARTISAN PARTY TO INTERFERE IN THE PROCESS THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD WAS SET UP DECADES AGO TO COULD THE MINISTER THE SELECTION IT FOR THE FARM WORKERS AND THE DESERTIFICATION ELECTIONS AS WELL AS THE ELECTIONS FOR REPRESENTATION AND I'VE SEEN THE ABUSE OF THIS VOTING METHOD OVER THE YEARS UPFRONT AND PERSONAL ON THE LINE WHERE THESE ELECTIONS WERE BEING ARE THESE CARDS WERE BEING COLLECTED THIS IS NOT DEMOCRATIC THIS IS A VERY PARTISAN WAY ARE NOT PARTISAN WAY BUT A VERY SELF INTERESTED WAY. TO ENHANCE REALLY ONE UNION WHO HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL OVER DECADES AND PROVIDING GOOD SERVICES TO THEIR WORKERS THAT THEY REPRESENT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE NEVER GROWN IT'S NEVER BEEN A UNION THE PROSPECT IT'S A GOOD CAUSE AND THEY'RE IN WHAT HAS BEEN THEIR SUCCESS BUT IN TERMS OF GETTING EMPLOYEES BARM WORKERS TO JOIN THE UNION THE ALLEN WANTED TO. THAT UNION HAS LANGUISHEDIN DIFFERENT PRODUCT UP BY FEDERAL FUNDS OVER THE YEARS AND BY LEGISLATION OVER THE YEARS HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS PROPPING UP ONE UNION. SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU- THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX ONE SIX- AS A TEACHER OF THE SENATE LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT COMMITTEE- I WANT TO. MAKE SURE TO- GET THE STATEMENT ON THE FOREIGN ON THE RECORD THAT THIS BILL WAS VETTED THOROUGHLY BY COMMITTEE STAFF- BETTER THOROUGHLY BY THE COMMITTEE ITSELF I GOT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE ON A FOUR TO ONE VOTE. IN ALL THE ISSUES THAT I'VE HEARD RAISED TODAY- HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. THIS BILL IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL ANALYSIS REQUIRES THESE BALLOTS THAT WERE REFERRED TO BE SEALED IN ENVELOPES. AND SIGNED UP BY THE ACTUAL EMPLOYEE. OF THEY CAN BE DELIVERED BY SOMEONE ELSE- NOT. UNLIKE WHAT VOTERS WILL BE DOING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION AND MOST UPCOMING ELECTIONS- NOT UNLIKELY TO SOLUTION THAT WE'VE ADOPTED HERE. IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW RANK AND FILE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA- TO PUT THEIR BALLOTS IN ENVELOPES. AND SEAL THEM. SIGN THEM- AND THEN HAVE THOSE ENVELOPES DESTROYED BEFORE COUNTING OR SET ASIDE. SO THAT THE BALLOT ITSELF REMAINS SECRET- THINK CAN BE DELIVERED BY THIRD PARTY AGAIN. MUCH LIKE WE DO WITH CALIFORNIA ELECTION LAW- I THINK THE BILL IS SOLID. I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED TO SOME DEGREE OTHER THAN- THE OBVIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE FOLKS WOULD HAVE WHO ARE AGAINST ORGANIZED IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHY AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS YOU KNOW SPENT SOME TIME IN THAT SPACE- WOULD WANT THE DISRUPTION. OF THESE ELECTIONS GOING ON ON SITE- WITHOUT THE ABILITY OF PUTTING BALLOTS AND ENVELOPES IN GATHERING THEM REMOTELY AND GETTING THEM DELIVERED- IN IN AN EFFICIENT. MANNER AND IN A MANNER THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE SAME EFFICACY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS IN THE SAME LACK OF CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE. IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH OUR OWN. ELECTIONS COLLECTION PROCESSES SO I STRONGLY. URGE AND I VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU SENATOR TIGHTER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT. MY PARENTS WERE FORMER OCCURS AND I USED TO BE A LABOR ORGANIZER FOR SEVERAL YEARS- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I NOTICED AS AN ORGANIZER- TRYING TO RECRUIT MEMBERSHIP INTO A UNION IS THAT- INDIVIDUALS HAD TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF HAVING A UNION. TELLING THEM OR EVEN SENDING A BALLOT DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE UNION NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF VALUE IN HAVING MILLIONS IN THE WORKPLACES- I'LL TELL YOU THAT I'VE ALSO MET THIS WEEKEND WITH FARMERS. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE LAST THING ON THEIR MIND IS WHETHER OR NOT TO JOIN THE UNION RIGHT NOW THE ONE MAIN CONCERN ON THEIR MIND IS WATER BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY WATER THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB AND THIS BILL CAN MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH AND IT IT IT I'M SURE THE DEAN THE INTENTIONS OF THE BILL. I SEEK TO DO GOOD FOR FARM WORKERS THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT. HOWEVER BY THE TIME IT GETS THERE. WILL BE THOUSANDS OF FARM WORKERS WITHOUT JOBS THE FARMWORKERS NEED ACTION RIGHT NOW AND- I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE SPELL LIKE I SAID IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR FARM WORKERS THEY NEED WATER. THEY NEED OPPORTUNITIES AND- FOR ALL THESE REASONS I'LL BE. STAYING OFF THE SPOT TODAY IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SINGMAN SENATOR LABOR YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OF WHAT A LOT OF THINGS TO UNPACK HERE TO THE SENATOR FROM SANGER DO NOT CONFUSE THIS ISSUE WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT FARM WORKERS NEED WATER AND JUST BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT VOTE FOR UNION TODAY THEY MIGHT NEED THAT RIGHT AND HAVE IT IN PLACE TOMORROW OR IN THE FUTURE SO YOU COULD STILL VOTE YES ON THIS BILL AND WE COULD STILL DO SOMETHING FOR THEM. AND THEIR GUARDS TO WATER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD I KNOW THAT YOU OWN A TEMPORARY WORKER AGENCY I DID NOT KNOW YOU HAD SO MUCH EXPERTISE IN ORGANIZING WORKERS I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. YOUR BALANCE IS KEPT SECRET. UNLESS SOMEONE HELPS YOU THAT IS NOT KEPT SECRET SO WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY ANYONE'S RIGHT HERE TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO REFERRED TO MR GOLD'S PEAS MR GOLD PIECE WAS MISLEADING AND IT WAS AN ACCURATE AT BEST MEMBERS WHEN I LOOK AT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WHO ORGANIZED FOR AS MANY OR MORE YEARS THAN I DID. WE KNOW IT'S NOT UNION INTIMIDATION WE KNOW THAT IT IS PLACES LIKE HOME DEPOT WALMART CORPORATIONS WHO WILL SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WITH ANTI UNION RHETORIC IN CAMPAIGNS TO KEEP THE UNION OUT WE KNOW THAT IN SMALLER VENUES WITH SMALLER EMPLOYERS. THEY DO DIFFERENT THINGS I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO ORGANIZE A MACARONI PLANT IN CHINO ORLANDO'S MACARONI THE EMPLOYERS CAME IN THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION AND GAVE EVERYONE A THOUSAND DOLLAR BONUS AND WHAT I SAID TO THOSE WORKERS AS I SAID TAKE THAT MONEY AND VOTE FOR THE UNION TO. A SET BECAUSE DID THEY EVER GIVE YOU A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR BONUS PRIOR TO YOU WANTING TO FORM A UNION. NO THEY DID NOT THE CARDS ARE ALWAYS STACKED AGAINST THE WORKER WHO IS TRYING TO FORM A UNION. TO HAVE A MORE JUST AND FAIR WORKPLACE. THIS BILL IS SIMPLE MY FRIENDS THIS BILL IS ABOUT ALLOWING A DIFFERENT OPTION. FOR FARM WORKERS TO VOTE. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK.
