00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:45.851
IMPORTANT SPUR AND HOW IN THIS

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:48.920
OF. AND OUR LOOK FOR TO

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:03.868
BONDS. THAT WOULD ENABLE

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:05.269
ACCELERATING TRANSPORTATION

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:08.172
MAINTENANCE AND REHAB PROJECTS

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:10.274
INCLUDED IN THE SHOP. I'LL ALSO

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:12.009
COMMENT ON THE ABILITY OF THE

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.844
CHANCE TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:16.080
REVENUE TO REPEAT THE BOND.

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:17.982
THERE ARE THREE REASONS THAT

00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:19.617
RAISING REVENUE IN THE COMING

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:22.119
YEARS MAYBE WORTH UNDERTAKING

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:24.421
RIGHT NOW. FIRST IT WOULD

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.157
ENABLE THE STATE TO ACCELERATE

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:28.425
SPENDING ON PROJECTS FEDERAL

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:30.261
READY INCLUDED A SHOP. WHAT THE

00:40:30.327 --> 00:40:31.729
ECONOMY IS DEPRESSED AND

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:34.131
CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE LIKELY

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.667
TO BE LOW BECAUSE OF A HIGH

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:38.769
LEVEL OF COMPETITION. AMONG THE

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:41.705
CURRENT. CHECK IN WELL WHAT THE

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.374
STATE TO ISSUE REVENUE BONDS

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.275
WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:46.477
RELATIVELY LOW. AND THEY'RE

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:48.612
BACKED BY A C. LEVY ON EVERY

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.247
REGISTERED VEHICLE IN

00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:52.183
CALIFORNIA IN THE ANNUAL FEE

00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:53.751
THAT RANGES FROM TWENTY FIVE

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:55.386
DOLLARS TO A HUNDRED AND

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:56.453
SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS. DEPENDING

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.222
ON THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLES

00:40:58.289 --> 00:40:59.623
AND THAT VALUES INGESTED

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:02.226
ANNUALLY FOR INFLATION. AND

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:04.628
THIRD WHILE REVENUE GENERATED

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:05.930
BY THE CHIEF IS DIFFICULT TO

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:08.165
PREDICT WITH PRECISION. IN MY

00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:10.534
OPINION IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:12.336
TO JUSTIFY THE ISSUANCE OF THE

00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:14.672
REVENUE BONDS AT A LEVEL THAT

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:16.073
CAN FINALLY MANY OF THESE

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.409
PROJECTS. DO REVENUE CAN'T BE

00:41:18.475 --> 00:41:19.443
PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.879
BECAUSE VEHICLE PURCHASES AND

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:23.514
THE COMPOSITION OF THE STATE'S

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:24.682
FLEET OF PRIVATELY OWNED

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:27.084
VEHICLES WILL BE DETERMINED BY

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.719
THE DEATHS OF THE CURRENT

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:30.554
ECONOMIC DEPRESSION. AND THE

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:32.623
PACE OF RECOVERY. ANNOTATION

PURCHASES DURING A PERIOD OF

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.128
UNCERTAINTY. AND WHETHER THERE

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.363
WOULD BE VEHICLE PURCHASE

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.031
INCENTIVES THAT COULD BE

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:43.234
IMPACTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AS

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.935
PART OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY

00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:47.137
PACKAGE. THE STATE OF THE RICH

00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:49.874
DIVERSITY BUT EVEN CONSERVATIVE

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.777
ESTIMATES OF THE TEST. EVEN IN

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.846
A SITUATION OF CERTAINTY

00:41:55.913 --> 00:42:01.318
SUGGEST STATE AND. STREET PRIOR

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:04.622
TO THE- ECONOMIC DATA. WOOD

KING FROM UCLA I PARTICIPATED

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.698
IN THE STUDY THAT ESTIMATED

TRIP REVENUE BETWEEN TWENTY

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:18.869
EIGHT AND TWENTY FORTY UNDER A

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.871
RANGE OF WHAT TENDS AND

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:25.542
UNCONTROVERSIAL ASSUMPTIONS-

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:27.044
AND- ONE THE BIG FACTORS IS HOW

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:29.380
MANY. IN THE FLEET WILL BE

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:31.415
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. DEPENDS UPON

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:32.950
THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE AND

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:34.652
ELECTRIC VEHICLES TEND TO BE

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.854
TAPPED HIGH VALUE. WE ESTIMATE

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:38.889
THAT ANNUAL REVENUE FROM THE

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:42.626
TEST WOULD INCREASE STEADILY TO

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:43.427
TWENTY FORTY IT WOULD BE ABOUT

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:45.229
A BILLION POINT FIVE BILLION

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:49.366
THAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR TO- TWO

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:51.135
AND A HALF BILLION AND REALLY-

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:54.605
BY TWENTY FORTY- AND OBVIOUSLY.

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:56.941
THE CATASTROPHIC ECONOMIC

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:59.009
IMPACT OF THE COLD WITH

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:01.679
NINETEEN- WILL AFFECT THAT SO

00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:03.347
IN MAY WE PUBLISHED A PEER

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:05.316
REVIEWED UPDATE OF OUR EARLIER

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:06.850

NINETEEN. AND WE AGAIN

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:12.056
ESTIMATES THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:13.157
THE END OF THE REVENUE COULD BE

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:15.826
BELOW BUT CLOSE TO TWO BILLION

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:17.928

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:22.967
HOW QUICKLY BOUNCED BACK. WE

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:25.836
ARE NOW. BEGINNING A ROUND OF.

LOWER TAX REVENUES AND WE MIGHT

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:51.395
HOPE FOR. BUT OUR PROJECTIONS-

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:52.963
THAT WERE MADE A FEW MONTHS AGO
