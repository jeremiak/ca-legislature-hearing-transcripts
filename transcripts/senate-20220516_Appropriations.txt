YES THANK YOU MY NAME IS ALEX STUBER I HAVE A SON WHO- YEAH SAY YOU KNOW SAYS I AM SUPPORTING THIS BILL. JUDGE MANLEY SCORED IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS BEING THE ONLY TIME THE LIFE THANK YOU SIR. THE BOOK. AND CURRENTLY NOT TRIGGERING QUEUE ALL RIGHT WE'VE TAKEN OUR SUPPORT NOW WE WILL GO WE HAVE I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THREE LEAD WITNESSES OUR PRIMARY WITNESS TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION- WE HAVE KAREN THE CARI ON BEHALF OF MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA CALIFORNIA ERIC HARRIS ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY RIGHTS. AND THEN WE HAVE SOMEBODY- MICHELLE CABRERA FROM THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION WHO ALL EXPRESSED CONCERNS. THE THREE OF YOU HAVE A TOTAL OF FIVE MINUTES I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SPOKEN AMONGST YOURSELVES TO KAREN BUKHARI ON BEHALF OF MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA AND OU CAN PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR KAREN TO CARRY MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH EMPOWERMENT NETWORK. MY SISTER JENNIFER LIVES WITH SMI S. U. D. AND IS OVER TWENTY YEARS HOMELESS I HAVE SEEN THE EFFECTS ON HER OF THE EXTREME TRAUMA SHE HASN'T TOWARD OVERTIME. THIS TRAUMA LEADS TO FEAR OF THE SYSTEM WHICH MAKES PEOPLE LIKE HER VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY COSTLY TO SERVE. REQUIRING JENNIFER TO ATTEND COURT BECAUSE OF A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION WILL ONLY EXACERBATE HER TRAUMA AND CAUSE HER TO RUN. THE LAST TIME SHE WAS IN TREATMENT SHE STARTED OUT EXCITED BUT WITHIN THREE WEEKS AS SHE BEGAN TO WORK THROUGH HER TRAUMA SHE COULDN'T HANDLE IT AND SHE LEFT THE PROGRAM. THAT WAS ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO AND I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER SINCE. JENNIFER REALLY WANTS SERVICES BUT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE LIKE HER MONEY WILL BE WASTED AND THE TARGET POPULATION WILL NOT BE HELPED. CARE COURT WILL REQUIRE MUCH MORE STATE FUNDING THAN THE MAY REVISE ADDRESSES. INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS FOR DIVERSE HOUSING. FUNDING FOR COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES AND ADDITIONAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS. SB THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT INCLUDES THE GUARANTEE OF HOUSING THE CYCLE OF HOMLESSNESS CRISIS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS WILL NOT BE BROKEN UNTIL CALIFORNIA INVEST INVOLUNTARY COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. WITH PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. NOT ONLY WILL CARE COURT NOT WORK FOR LIKE MY SISTER IT WILL BE A COSTLY MISTAKE FOR CALIFORNIA. I URGE YOU TO VOTE KNOWING CARE COURT AND TAKE THE TIME TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE COST EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL SOLUTION WITHOUT PEOPLE LIKE JENNIFER THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE WILL GO TO OUR NEXT WITNESS ERIC HARRIS. GOOD MORNING SHARE MY NAME IS AIR CARRIERS AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I HAVE A PHYSICAL DISABILITY AND HAVE SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES INCLUDING ONE SPECIFICALLY WHO HAS BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED AND ALMOST. THE R. C. IS PART OF A COALITION WITH MORE THAN FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS IN COMPLETE OPPOSITION TO S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT. KERA COURT IS A COMPLETE VIOLATION OF DISABILITY RIGHTS HUMAN RIGHTS AND IS A RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUE THAT WILL HARM BLACK IN LINE NEXT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AT A DISPROPORTIONATE RATE. WE KNOW THE BLACK PEOPLE ESPECIALLY ARE MISDIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND ARE NOT GIVEN ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IF THEY NEED THEM. OUR HOUSE PEOPLE WILL BE TARGETED SO IT'S LIKELY MORE MANY MORE PEOPLE DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK INDIGENOUS AND OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR WILL BE SWEPT UP WHICH IS A WASTE OF RESOURCES AND WILL CAUSE MORE HARM THAN GOOD. ALTHOUGH THE BILL ANALYSIS ESTIMATES THAT 700-021-2000 PEOPLE COULD BE INCLUDED IN CARE COURT. THAT COULD BE SERVED A SEVERELY LOW ESTIMATE WITH ANNUAL COST IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACCOUNT FOR TREATMENT COURT COSTS TRANSPORTATION HOUSING STAFF AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES. WE HAVE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE ON HOUSING CALIFORNIA ANY NUMBER OF THEM COULD BE EXPERIENCING VARIOUS DISABILITIES AND TRAUMA AT ANY TIME. THE POLICY AND COST OF S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT COULD BE ASTRONOMICAL BASED ON OUR RESEARCH AND THE WORK OF ORGANIZATIONS WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR THIS FRAMEWORK OF THE BILL IS HALF BAKED AT BEST AND COULD BE A DISASTER WORSE. THE STATE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB SAVING AND HAS AN ESTIMATED SURPLUS OF NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS CALIFORNIA CAN NOT GO BACKWARDS BY TAKING ON A FRAMEWORK THAT CREATES AN UNKNOWN BURDEN ON THE STATE. YOUR ADVOCATES HOUSING ADVOCATES AND OTHERS BELIEVE THAT HAVE BETTER MENTAL HEALTH STRATEGY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED FOR NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU AND I URGE A NO VOTE ON SB THIRTEEN THIRTY. THANKS VERY MUCH MISTER HARRISON WE HAVE MICHELLE CABRERA. NOT SURE IF SHE'S HERE IN PERSON THANK. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MICHELLE KEPT IT UP WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS BELIEVE THAT WE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT NEW COSTS WHICH THE STATE WILL BE OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE AS A RESULT OF SB THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT. THESE INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT COSTS OUTSIDE OF MEDICAL SERVICES CURRENTLY COVERED THROUGH THE STATE'S REALIGNMENT DEAL WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES WE BELIEVE THE STATE LINKER NEW MANDATE AND RIVER REIMBURSEMENT REQUIREMENTS IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OR MORE FOR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS HOURS OF TIME SPENT IN COURT AS WELL AS PERFORMING OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT. THAT IS TIME SPENT LOOKING FOR RESPONDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY AND ATTEMPTING TO CONVINCE THEM TO WORK WITH US AT EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS FROM THE SETTLEMENT TO EVALUATION TO DEVELOPMENT OF THE TREATMENT PLAN AND ONGOING ENGAGEMENT AND SERVICES. NON MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM THE COURT AND OTHER NON MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS SERVICES ORDERED BY pTHROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR MEDICAL INSURANCE TIME SPENT ENGAGING INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR HOUSING PLANT AND COORDINATION OF HOUSING WITH THOSE HOUSING PROVIDERS. TIME SPENT ENGAGING AND SERVING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PRIVATELY INSURED AND SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT FROM THEIR INSURANCE IN TO MEET WITH COURTS ON REFERRALS EVALUATION SETTLEMENTS AND ONGOING HEARINGS. AND THE TIGHT TIMELINES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL WILL REQUIRE HIGHER THAN NORMAL STAFFING LEVELS IN TERMS OF THE IMPACTED POPULATIONS CBH DA BELIEVES THAT REFERRAL SECURE PORT WILL RANGE IN THE HIGH TENS OF THOUSANDS TO LOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS. AS WE BELIEVE THAT THE INITIAL INTERESTING USING CARE COURT- TO ADDRESS THE BROADER HOW ISSUE OR THE- IN ABILITY OF PEOPLE WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE TO ACCESS ADEQUATE COVERAGE WILL FAR EXCEED THE TARGET. RANGE A CITED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. PROCESSING THESE REFERRALS ALONE WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT COUNTY STAFF TIME WORKLOAD CAN CLICK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
