WITH THE LOW STATUTE SAYS IS

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.487
THAT.

00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:39.423
A MANUFACTURER IT'S NOT ALLOWED

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:41.491
TO COMPETE AGAINST A DEALER OF

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:43.193

00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:50.767
STATUTE.

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:52.803
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEN IS THAT

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:54.938
ONE MANUFACTURER STARTED SELLING

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:57.608
PARTS DIRECTLY ON AMAZON NOW OUR

00:47:57.674 --> 00:47:59.176
PROBLEM ISN'T THE FACT THAT IT'S

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.545
BEING SOLD ON THE INTERNET? WE

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:03.213
DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT WE CARE IS

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.514
THAT A MANUFACTURER'S NOW

00:48:04.581 --> 00:48:05.916
COMPETING AGAINST A DEALER BY

00:48:05.983 --> 00:48:07.851

THREE RESPONSES IN THE LETTER

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:26.136

TWO IF WE WERE SELLING PARTS

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.408

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:33.377
ABOUT THAT WE CAN'T COMPETE

AGAINST YOU WANT PARKS AND THREE.

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:38.448

STATE NOT IRRELEVANT MARKET AREA

00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:47.858

IT'S NOT GOING IN MY RELEVANT

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:53.964
MARKET AREA AND IT'S GOING TO

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:55.832
THE STATE. THAT'S NOT FAIR THAT

00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:57.434

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:30.339
ONE THERE WAS A THERE WAS A VERY

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:32.542
CLEAR DESIGN FLAW IN THIS BILL

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.644
AND AS IT WAS CONSTRUCTED THAT

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:35.244
EVERY EXPERT THAT'S LOOKED AT

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:36.679
THIS.

BEEN DONE AND IS THAT WHAT IT IS

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.184
IS EMBEDDING THE DRAINS IN THIS

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.085
BILL WAY CONSIDERING THE

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.720
GEOLOGIC CONDITIONS UP THERE.

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.789
AND WHAT SHOULD BUT NOT AT THE

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.257
TIME THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.825
NOTICED AS A DESIGN FLAW.

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:51.627
EW ARE NEVER LOOKED BACK AT THE

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.198
PROJECT.

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:59.068
AND SO THIS CONTINUE TO BE GO.

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:00.970
UNNOTICED AND UNRECOGNIZED.

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:02.638
AT THE DEPARTMENT.

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:04.840
CRACKING THAT CONTINUALLY

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.209
HAPPENED EVERY TEN YEARS ON THE

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:07.476
SPILLWAY.

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.412
SHOULD HAVE RAISE RED FLAGS

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:11.113
THIS WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.015
REPORT. AB WAS IT INSTEAD

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.283
NORMALIZED.

BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:17.153
RESOURCES.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.355
AND THE OVER CONFIDENCE FACTOR

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:20.957
NINE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.226

AT HERB BROUGHT TO.

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.030
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:29.665
ATTENTION THAT THERE WERE

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:31.767
GEOLOGIC ISSUES WITH WHETHER OF

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.469
ROCK ON THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.605
DE W. R. RESPONDED AND SAID NO

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.341
THIS IS BUILT ON COMPETENT ROCK.

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:39.842
AND ACTUALLY RESPONDED WITH AN

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:42.411
ATTACHMENT TO ONE OF THEIR MEMOS.

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:45.281
SHOWING SOME OF THE GEOLOGIC LE.

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.283
BOREN'S

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:48.584
IF THEY WERE TO LOOK CLOSER AT

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:49.919
THOSE ACTUAL BORING'S THAT THEY

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:52.388
SHOWED THAT THEY ACTUALLY GAVE A.

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.990
TO FOR THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.658
THAT THERE WAS GEOLOGIC.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:56.859
WEATHERED ROCK IN THOSE

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.494
FORMATIONS.

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.263
SO THERE'S SOME VERY SERIOUS

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.564
ISSUES HERE AND IT RAISES

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.199
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE ENTIRE

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:04.834
PROJECT BEING. OPERATED

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.901
REGULATORY DECISIONS ARE

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:07.737
ULTIMATELY.

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:08.571
THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW THE STATE

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.172
WATER PROJECT IS OWNED AND

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.874
OPERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT. IT'S

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:14.710
ALSO REGULATED AND INSPECTED BY

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.379
THEIR DIVISION OF THEM SAFETY.

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:17.613
AND THIS IS BY ONE OF THE ONLY

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.382
PLACES I'VE SEEN WHERE WE THE

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:20.116
OWNER AND OPERATOR ALSO

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:21.684
REGULATES.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.886
THE SAME PROJECT REGULATORY

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:24.820
DECISIONS ARE ALSO WE MADE BY

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:25.988
THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.324
WHO ALSO ACTS AS A WATER MANAGER.

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:29.959
IS INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:31.494
THAT THE OWNER OF THE PROJECT.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.329
IS ALSO THE REGULAR MOVED MOVING

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:33.996
FORWARD.

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.898
MY MOVING THE PROJECT TO AN

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:36.766
INDEPENDENT BODY NOT ONLY

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:37.933
REMOVES THIS CONFLICT OF

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.402
INTEREST BUT IT ALSO INCREASES

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.003
TRANSPARENCY.

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.772
ABOUT PROJECT OPERATIONS AND I

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:43.406
THINK THIS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:44.674
POINT.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.742
IN THE.

01:05:46.809 --> 01:05:47.476
IN THE INDEPENDENT FORENSIC

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.612
REPORT IT STATED THAT WHAT THERE

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:51.080
WAS COST PRESSURES

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:52.648
APPLY TO YOU W. OR BY THE WATER

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:54.717
CONTRACTORS THEY WERE NOT

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.819
SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT HAPPENED.

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.387
THEY SAID THESE ISSUES MAY HAVE

01:05:58.454 --> 01:05:59.488
BEEN RAISED IN MEETINGS HERE'S

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:00.756
THE PROBLEM A LOT OF THOSE MEANS

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.258
ARE NOT PUBLIC.

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:03.592
THIS INDEPENDENT COMMISSION

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.328
WOULD BE SUBJECT TO BAGLEY KEENE

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:06.329
AND THEREFORE THESE

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:07.963
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OPERATION

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:09.332
AND MAINTENANCE WOULD BE MUCH

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:10.866
MORE TRANSPARENT.

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:13.502

DECISIONS ABOUT THESE PROJECTS

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:22.912
ARE MADE IN PUBLIC MEETINGS BY

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:24.413
INDEPENDENT BODIES THAT

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.249

THERE.

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:49.505
WHATEVER FEMA DOESN'T COVER AND

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:50.773
RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.374
THEY ARE GOING TO COVER THAT
