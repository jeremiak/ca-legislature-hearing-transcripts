WE WANT TO BE IN THE SAME POSITION REGARDING HYDROGEN. HYDROGEN CAN BE MADE FROM ELECTRICITY THAT WAS GENERATED FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES SUCH AS OLAR AND WIND. IT CAN DECARBONISE DIFFICULT SECTORS LIKE SHIPPING FREIGHT VEHICLES AIR TRAVEL DIFFERENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES IT ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A GREAT FORM OF STORAGE FOR ELECTRICITY. AND BECAUSE HE CAN UTILIZE MUCH EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IT CAN PRESERVE WELL PAYING JOBS THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE BILL INCLUDED ABOUT TEN BILLION IN HYDROGEN INVESTMENTS IN UP TO TWO BILLION EACH FOR REGIONAL HYDROGEN HUBS. THIRTY SP TEN SEVENTY FIVE ADVANCES GREEN HYDROGEN BY ESTABLISHING A GREEN HYDROGEN HUB FUND TO PROVIDE STATE MATCHING WHICH WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR US TO BE COMPETITIVE IN ORDER TO GET ACCESS FEDERAL MONIES. AND IT ALSO DIRECTS STATE AGENCIES TO ADOPT GREEN HARD TO CHANGE INTO THEIR DECARBONIZATION PLANNING EFFORTS SO REQUIRES R. AGIR RESOURCES BOARD FOR EXAMPLE TO DEVELOP A ROAD MAP FOR HYDROGEN ROLL OUT IN CALIFORNIA. AND REQUIRES OR VARIOUS OTHER AGENCIES TO ESTABLISH SOME DEFINITIONS FOR CLEANER GREEN HYDROGEN THERE IS A DEFINITION IN THIS BILL BUT IT IS THE DEFINITION OF- THAT THE FED GOVERNMENT IS USING AND THE DEFINITION IN THIS BILL IS ONLY RELATES TO THE HUB. AND IT STATED PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND TO ENABLE US TO BE COMPETITIVE FOR THAT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS TO ENABLE TO US TO ALIGN HOPEFULLY GET SOME OF THAT MONEY.

IN A WAY THAT IS ACTUALLY LOW CARBON IS THAT IT CAN ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE AIR POLLUTANTS THAT CAUSE SMOG BECAUSE IT HAS THE BENEFIT TO BE APPLIED TO THINGS LIKE GOODS MOVEMENT IN OUR PORTS WHICH ARE SOME OF OUR LARGEST SOURCES. OF THE THINGS THAT ARE DIRTYING THE AIR IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO IT SAYS IT'S ONE OF THOSE TOOLS THAT- LIKE OUR SENATOR FROM IRVINE ORANGE COUNTY REFERENCED. IN I'M I LIKE TO BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL HOWEVER I THINK WE WANT TO BE POSITIONED AND THIS WOULD HELP US POSITION BECAUSE THERE'S ALL THE ADVANCEMENTS AROUND HYDROGEN ARE HAPPENING FAST AND FURIOUS AND WE WANT TO BE RIGHT THERE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD MORNING- I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT US B. ELEVEN OH FOUR WHICH WILL DANCE THE COORDINATION ECONOMIC VITALITY OF OUR FREIGHT SECTOR. OF THE FREIGHT SECTOR DRIVES ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY CREATING MILLIONS OF JOBS AS WE KNOW IN MOVING TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF GOODS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. HOWEVER DESPITE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE FREIGHT SECTOR THE RECENT SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS IS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS COMPLEX SYSTEM IS BETTER HIGH LEVEL COORDINATION IN PLANNING S. B. ELEVEN OH FOUR ACTUALLY ADDRESSES THAT. BY CREATING AN OFFICE OF FREIGHT WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND REQUIRING THIS OFFICE TO DEVELOP AN ASSESSMENT PLAN- FOR THE ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS OF THE SECTOR. THE OFFICE OF FREE WILL ALSO ACT AS THE STATE ENTITY THAT WILL FACILITATE COORDINATION FOR THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN- AND A GLARING EXAMPLE OF THE LOSSES CALIFORNIA INCURRED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FREE. ECONOMIC PLANNING IS THAT WE'RE MISSING OUT ON FEDERAL DOLLARS AS WELL WEST COAST PORTS HAVE RECIEVED ONLY ABOUT 10% OF FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR PORT INFRASTRUCTURE HISTORICALLY WHEN COMPARED TO THE DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO EASTERN GULF COAST. S. B. ELEVEN OH FOUR WILL ADDRESS THESE SHORTCOMINGS AND ENABLE BETTER STATEWIDE ECONOMIC PLANNING AND COORDINATION TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY IN PERSON I BELIEVE I HAVE MARTHA MILLER FROM THE CALIFORNIA PORT AUTHORITIES AND MIKE JACOBS FROM THE PACIFIC MARITIME.

OF WE DO HAVE A VERY SERIOUS- ISSUE AS YOU ALL KNOW WITH RESPECT TO SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS. AND OUR ONGOING IMPACTS FROM COVE IN PANDEMIC AND RESULTING- IMPACTS TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE- REALLY SORELY MISSED- AND THE RESPONSES SUPPLY CHAIN IS DIRECT COORDINATION ACROSS ALL OF OUR AGENCIES. AS AN INSTITUTIONAL MATTER AT THIS STAGE. VISIBILITY DRESSES THAT. IT FACILITATES COORDINATION IN INSTITUTIONAL WAY BY MAKING THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF GO B. AS AN OFFICE OF FREIGHT IS ESTABLISHED. WE SUPPORT THAT. WE ASK FOR THAT AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION FOR THIS BILL. IN ADDITION THE BILL DOES FOSTER A LONG TERM PLACE FOR THE STATE TO ADDRESS COMPETITIVENESS. WHICH AS YOU ALL KNOW IS- A LONG TERM ISSUE FACING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND REPORTS AS WE- TRY OUR BEST TO MAINTAIN. OUR CARGO IN THE FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IN CANADA AND MEXICO. SO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION THIS MORNING. THANK YOU SIR MS MILLER. HELLO MY NAME IS MARTHA MILLER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PORT AUTHORITIES WHICH CONSISTS OF THE ELEVEN COMMERCIAL SEAPORTS IN CALIFORNIA- AND WE'RE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN OH FOUR BY SENATOR LENA GONZALES. AND DESPITE THE TO CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE AND ECONOMY THE RECENT SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS IS SHOWING THE CONFERENCE RATE SECTOR IS IN NEED OF BETTER PLANNING AND COORDINATION ACROSS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IN RESPONSE TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS THE BY THE MINISTRATION RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR CENTRALIZED LEADERSHIP APPOINTED A POOR ENVOY TO MEET ACROSS SECTORS WITH STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE NATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN. TO MITIGATE THE CONGESTION IN REAL TIME WE SAW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS FEDERAL APPROACH. AND WHILE GO BIZ AND HOUSE TO HAVE TAKEN LEADERSHIP ROLES IN FACILITATING COORDINATION THERE'S CURRENTLY NO STATE ENTITY OFFICE OR POSITION WITH THE AUTHORITY AND CAPACITY TO COORDINATE ACROSS THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN AND SUPPORTING AGENCIES. CAPA ALONG WITH OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE GOODS MOVEMENT SECTOR INCLUDING GO BANDS CAL STAR. THE CDFA- PARTICIPATED IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN SUCCESS SUMMIT THIS PAST FALL I KEEP FINDING FROM THE SUMMIT WHICH AIMS TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX CHALLENGES FACING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN WAS THAT OUR STATE MUST DEVELOP A CENTRALIZED STATE OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING. AND SETTING CLEAR GOALS THAT PROMOTE ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS IN THE FREIGHT SECTOR HAS TO BE ELEVEN OH FOUR WILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS RECOMMENDATION BY ESTABLISHING THE OFFICE OF FREIGHT THE SERVICE THE COORDINATING ENTITY TO STEER COMPETITIVENESS AND SUSTAINABILITY. ACROSS EVERY SECTOR AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOLUTIONS THAT WILL HELP GET KIDS MOVING FASTER WE BELIEVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND SMARTER COORDINATION WITHIN STATE LEADERSHIP IS CRITICAL. THANK YOU AGAIN AND WE APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR GONZALES. THANK YOU MA'AM. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. USING THE WITNESS. WILL NOW MOVE TO.

I. COMMUNITY OR THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY- WHICH COURSES AND- PARTICULARLY CITED- AND ANALYSIS- AND I JUST MAKE NOTE THAT- WE NEED TO DO BETTER JOB OF GETTING DATA.

BILL HAS TWELVE VOTES WILL HOLD ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. CENTER OF SHOWBOAT YOUR ONE BILL TODAY SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE. YOU'RE FREE TO- PRESENT FROM YOUR DESK RECEIVE ONE READING. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE WILL FULLY INTEGRATE ALL UNDERGROUND UTILITIES INTO THE CALL BEFORE YOU DIG LAW BY ADDING CALTRANS AS A UTILITY OPERATOR UNDER THE STATE'S TWO REGIONAL SUB SERVICE UTILITY NOTIFICATION CENTERS AND BY ADDING NON PRESSURIZED SEWER LINES AND STORM DRAINS TO THE DEFINITION OF. SUB SERVICE INSTALLATION CURRENT LAW REQUIRES AN INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY PLANNING TO PERFORM AN EXCAVATION TO INFORM ONE OF TWO REGIONAL NOTIFICATION CENTERS SO OPERATORS OF ANY UNDERGROUND UTILITIES IN THAT AREA CAN MARK THEIR FACILITIES. THE LAW IS INTENDED TO PREVENT EXCAVATORS FROM DAMAGING UNDERGROUND UTILITIES ONCE IN THIS COMPUTER CONTACTS A REGIONAL NOTIFICATION CENTER CALLED LOCALLY REFERRED TO AS EIGHT ELEVEN. OR EIGHT ONE ONE ONE OR MORE UTILITY OPERATORS MARK THE LOCATION OF THEIR UNDERGROUND FACILITIES WITH PAINT FLAGS OR BY OTHER MEANS. IT IS THEN THE ESCALATORS RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE FACILITIES AND AVOID DAMAGING THEM. EIGHT TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN FEDERAL REPORT PRODUCED BY PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION GAVE CALIFORNIA A LOWER GRADE BECAUSE THE TWO NOTIFICATION CENTERS DO NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDE CALTRANS. WHO OPERATE RELATIVELY FEW SUB SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE ADJACENT TO ITS RIGHT OF WAYS. THE REPORT ALSO CITED THE EXCLUSION OF NON PRESSURIZED SEWER LINES OR STORM DRAINS AS REASONS FOR THE LOWER ASSESSMENT. THIS BILL SEEKS TO REMEDY BOTH OF THOSE DEFICIENCIES ADDITIONALLY THE CALIFORNIA COMMON GROUND ALLIANCE A STATE CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO EXCAVATION SAFETY CONSISTING OF UTILITIES YOU DON'T UTILITY LOCATING COMPANIES AND EXCAVATORS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL ADDITIONAL SHORTCOMINGS WITH CALIFORNIA'S EIGHT ONE ONE LAW. AND THOSE ARE THE FUNCTIONAL AND CLARIFYING ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL. I ALSO WANTED TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE QUICK MOVING NATURE OF THIS BILL AND THE LAST MINUTE OPPOSITION WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ADDRESS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES CONCERNS. IN THIS COMMITTEE. HOWEVER I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM MOVING FORWARD AND HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED WITH THEM THIS WEEK.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN BURST HOT BALLOON SIGN ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE ALERT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CALMLY CALLED DIGGER ALERT- I ALSO SPEAK IN SUPPORT FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE AMENDS THE CALL BEFORE YOU DIG LAW IT IS A FREE SERVICE FOR ANY PERSON OR COMPANY PLANNING TO DIG INTO THE GROUND. THE SERVICE REQUIRES MOST UTILITIES TO LOCATE AND MARK THEIR UNDERGROUND UTILITIES IN ORDER FOR THE PERSON OR COMPANY EXCAVATING TO DO SO SAFELY AROUND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS UNDERGROUND UTILITIES DILLARD REPORTS A SUCCESS RATE OF 99% IN AVOIDING UNDERGROUND UTILITIES FOR THOSE THAT USE THE LAW. SB THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE ORIGINATED FROM AN INDUSTRY WORKING GROUP CALLED CARGA THE CALIFORNIA REGIONAL COMMON GROUND ALLIANCE CARGO CONSISTS OF UTILITY COMPANIES EXCAVATORS AND COMPANIES THAT LOCATE AND MARK UNDERGROUND UTILITIES S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE IS PRIMARILY A TECHNICAL BILL DEVELOPED BY CORGAN'S INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES. THE BILL DOES EXPAND THE SERVICE TO GRAVITY DRIVEN SEWER LINES AND OF OTHER SIMILAR INFRASTRUCTURE. WE UNDERSTAND THE OPPONENTS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE COST AND ABILITY TO ACCURATELY LOCATE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE SCHEDULED TO MEET AS THE AUTHOR SAID I WITH THE OPPONENTS AND WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES- THIS WEEK. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT OVER THE LAST DECADE NOTABLY ASSEMBLYMEN LEVINS AT ELEVEN SIXTY SIX WHICH WAS SIGNED IN TWENTY NINETEEN REDUCES SOME OF THE WORKLOAD ON UTILITY OPERATORS BY TRANSITIONING TO PURELY ELECTRONIC REPORTING- THIS CHANGE MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL TO THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT COST AND WORKLOAD ISSUES.

FOR THIRTEEN HUNDRED UTILITY OPERATORS THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL STRONGLY- WE HEAR MANY TIMES FROM EXCAVATORS ABOUT YOU WERE LINES THAT ARE DAMAGED AS WELL AS FACILITIES OWNED BY CALTRANS. AND WHILE THE BILL IS PRIMARILY TECHNICAL IN NATURE WITH A NUMBER OF- SMALL- ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL HELP FACILITATE BETTER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ACTIVATOR AND UTILITY OPERATORS THE- REQUIREMENT TO ADD CALTRANS AND THE OPERATORS OF NON PRESSURIZED SEWER AND DRAIN LINE INTO THE FOLD IS CRITICAL TO SUCCESS OUR UNDERGROUND UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. IS UNDER MORE PRESSURE THAN EVER BEFORE WITH THE- COBIZ PAVING THE WAY FOR WORK AT HOME ALL THAT HAPPENED EXACTLY ONLY IF THE UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IS UP AND WORKING PROPERLY. ALL THE THINGS WE TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT DEFINE US AS A FIRST WORLD COUNTRY COMPARED TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES ARE ALL RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO PROTECT IT YOU CAN HAVE CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS INCLUDING UP TO DEATH WHEN- WHEN UTILITY LIKE COULD BE DAMAGED SO.
