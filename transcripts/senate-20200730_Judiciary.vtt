EXPERTS ON THE LINE WHO MAY BE

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:22.053
ABLE TO ASSIST IN ANSWERING

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.623
THAT QUESTION THE STANDARD ARE

MERRY WHICH USED MY UNDER IS

00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:38.904
YEAH AND IF THE IF THE MATTER

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.805
IS SETTLED THAT BIN AND THEN IT

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:42.540
WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE

00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:44.910
LABOR COMMISSIONER'S PROCESS TO

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:46.544
A FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT BETWEEN

00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:49.748
THE PARTIES THAT'S REACHED-

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:51.082
COULD CRITICIZE TO ASIAN WHERE

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:53.518
THE GRIEVANCES WITHDRAWN FROM

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:54.786
THE LABOR COMMISSION. THAT'S

00:25:54.853 --> 00:26:00.258
CORRECT. MY UNDERSTANDING THE

00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:01.893
REASON THE REASON WHY I ASK

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.697
AUTO BUT IT. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD.

00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:08.733
I KNOW GO AHEAD. THE REASON WHY

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.869
I ASK IS IN THE COURSE OF

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:13.438
BUSINESS I THINK WHAT IS LIKELY

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:15.941
TO HAPPEN. AND I WITH ALL DUE

00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:17.676
RESPECT THE FOLKS THAT DON'T

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:20.145
THINK THAT PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS

00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:21.613
FOR CONSUMER ATTORNEYS WHO

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.081
WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

00:26:23.148 --> 00:26:25.250
OPPORTUNITY. IS THAT IF IT'S

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.886
THE CASE THE ATTORNEYS FEES

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:30.021
COULD BE COLLECTED AND IT IS A

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:34.292
ONE SIDED- AS OPPOSED TO WHAT

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:36.061
WE LEARNED IN LAW SCHOOL THE

00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:39.197
BRITISH RULE AND- BY WAY OF

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:42.033
BACKGROUND. THE BRITISH RULE IS

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.070
THAT THE PREVAILING PARTY IS

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:49.140
ABLE TO COLLECT NOT JUST. ON

00:26:49.207 --> 00:26:51.142
ONE SIDE A SITUATION LIKE THIS

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:52.978
SO I THINK IN TERMS OF EQUITY I

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:54.546
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL

00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:56.214
LIKELY BE AN IMBALANCE OF

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:59.117
RESOURCES BETWEEN A LOW WAGE

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:01.419
EMPLOYEE VERSES EIGHT

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:03.888
CORPORATION I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.358
BUT FOR PURPOSES OF EQUITY. IF

00:27:06.424 --> 00:27:06.858
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE FOR

00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:10.061
ATTORNEYS FEES- ON THE TABLE I

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:12.130
THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS IN

00:27:12.197 --> 00:27:13.898
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT ON

00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:15.300
THEY DON'T HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:18.303
THE EXTENSION OF THE- STATURE

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.705
THE LIMITATIONS THEY HAVE ISSUE

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:22.607
WITH THE ATTORNEYS FEES AS TO

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:25.443
WHY SO I THINK. IF EQUITY IS

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.312
GUIDING THIS THEN I THINK IT

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:29.681
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO I'LL-

00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:31.716
BOTH PARTIES THE ABILITY TO

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:34.252
COLLECT BUT HERE'S REALLY WHERE

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:35.487
IT'S GONNA GO I SUSPECT. IS

00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:40.091
THAT. ONE DO WE HAVE A DEFINITE

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:41.626
DO WE HAVE A DEFINITION OF THE

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:43.294
PREVAILING PARTY IN A CIVIL

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:45.897
ACTION. I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:48.133
LABOR CIRCUMSTANCE BUT A CIVIL

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:51.503
ACTION. IT COULD BE A PARTIAL

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:53.505
VICTORY. LAW WOULD ALLOW AN

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:54.606
INDIVIDUAL TO DECLARE

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.107
THEMSELVES A PREVAILING PARTY

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:59.277
IT COULD BE 51% OF THE ACTIONS

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:00.845
OR DETERMINATIONS IN ONES

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:04.282
FAVOR- WHATEVER THE GUIDING

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:06.251
PRINCIPLE IS SO I DON'T KNOW

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:08.286
HOW IT PERTAINS IN A LABOR-

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:10.789
CONTEXT OF RETALIATION WHETHER

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:12.490
TO ONE DETERMINED OF. JUDGMENT

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:14.626
ON THE ISSUE OR THURSDAY

00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:16.761
ASSEMBLY OF DIFFERENT ISSUES SO

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:18.763
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW YOU

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.931
WOULD COME ABOUT WITH A

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:21.399
PREVAILING DETERMINATION THE

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:23.902
PREVAILING PARTY BUT MORE

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:25.804
REALISTICALLY. IF WE CAN IF WE

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.173
CAN APPRECIATE THAT THESE

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:30.542
THINGS ARE GOING TO BE SETTLED

00:28:30.608 --> 00:28:32.744
BY VIRTUE OF THE ELIGIBILITY

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:36.247
FOR- FOR THE FOR THE

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:38.349
ELIGIBILITY OF ATTORNEYS FEES.

00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:41.386
I CAN EASILY SEE. ATTORNEYS

00:28:41.453 --> 00:28:44.022
RACKING UP RETALIATION

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:46.091
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST AN EMPLOYER.

00:28:46.157 --> 00:28:48.059
EMPLOYER CALCULATING THE COST

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.962
OF GOING TO TRIAL OR GOING TO A

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:52.997
REGULATORY BODY IN DEFENDING

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:56.468
ITSELF IN SIMPLY SAYING I WILL

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:58.436
OFFER YOU THIS TO WITHDRAW YOUR

00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:01.539
COMPLAINT. AND THAT I THINK IS

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:03.808
A TERRIBLE DISINCENTIVE IN THE

00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:06.244
WORK FORCE BECAUSE THE

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:07.545
CORPORATION OR THE BUSINESS

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:09.080
WILL SIPLYLOOK AT THE

00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:10.849
OVERHEAD OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GO

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:13.118
THROUGH A REGULATORY REVIEW

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:15.153
WORD MINISTRY TO REVIEW. AND

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.857
JUST PAY IT OUT SO BY VOLUME

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:19.357
YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:23.361
ATTORNEYS. ASSEMBLING A NUMBER

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:25.096
OF INDIVIDUALS AND HAVE THIS

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:27.732
BEING A CASH COW SO- I THINK I

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:29.567
WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:31.870
FIRST PART OF IT. I WOULD ASK

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:35.039
THE AUTHOR OR THE PERSON

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:37.175
REPRESENTING THE AUTHOR. CAN'T

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:38.810
WE JUST LEAVE THE FIRST PART

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:40.979
THERE FOR THE EXTENSION. AND

00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:42.714
WITHDRAW THE ATTORNEY'S FEES

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.048
PORTION THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:46.918
THIS. A BI PARTISAN IN

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:47.952
CERTAINLY AN ACCEPTABLE BILL IN

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:49.721
MY OPINION THANK YOU CENTER

00:29:49.787 --> 00:29:50.889
PORCHES BEFORE I GO TO SENATOR

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:53.391
MORNING LET ME OBSERVE WE DON'T

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:54.959
USE THE BRITISH SYSTEM- AND

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.127
THERE'S A GOOD REASON WE DON'T

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:57.829
WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

00:29:57.896 --> 00:30:00.865
OF JUSTICE. AND IN TERMS OF THE

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:03.768
BALANCE OF POWER. THERE'S NO

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.570
QUESTION THAT CORPORATIONS.

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:08.439
HAVE MUCH GREATER RESOURCES AND

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:10.108
WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO HAVE AN

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:11.209
ATTORNEY'S FEES PRISON

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:13.811
PREVENTION. MANY PARTICULAR OF

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:15.713
OUR LOW WAGE WORKERS HAVE NO

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.682
RESOURCES I DON'T KNOW TOO MANY

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:19.517
ATTORNEYS WHO ARE WILLING TO

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:21.586
WORK FOR FREE THESE DAYS. AND

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.321
WE CERTAINLY PULL THE PLUG ON A

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:25.790
LOT OF OUR LEGAL AID PROGRAMS

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:26.991
THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD DO THAT

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:30.428
SO- I THINK THAT TO. YOU'D LIKE

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:32.163
TO BRING A BILL PERHAPS PICTURE

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.665
THAT PUSHED MOVES US INTO THE

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:35.633
BRITISH SYSTEM I'M SURE THAT

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.902
THAT WOULD TO. BE SOMETHING

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:40.505
THAT- YOU COULD TO- I THINK THE

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:42.106
SYSTEM WE HAVE HERE WORKS WELL

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:44.576
AND THESE DIRE PREDICTIONS JUST

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:46.844
DON'T EVER SEEM TO HAPPEN- SO.

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:49.080
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS MORE

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:51.549
FICTIONAL THAN FACT AND- I

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:54.485
THINK WE- WE REALLY NEED TO.

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:57.855
RECOGNIZE THAT. LAWSUIT AND-

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:59.857
THE OPPORTUNITY TO EQUALIZE THE

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:02.060
PLAYING FIELD JUST SIMPLY DON'T

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:04.529
HAPPEN IF. PLAINTIFFS WHO ARE

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:06.297
MOST OF THEM. WITHOUT THE

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:08.433
RESOURCES ARE FIGHTING THE

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:11.803
GOLIATH OF CORPORATE AMERICA

00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:12.303
WE'RE MANY OF THEM HAVE

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.840
STABLES. ALL FOR A- UP ON ON

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:21.246
SITE COUNCIL. THE RARE IN TO GO

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:22.280
AND VERY HAPPY TO. AND THESE

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:23.648
CLAIMS AND OF COURSE IF IT'S A

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:25.116
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT AGAINST

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:26.150
THROWN OUT AND THERE ARE

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.952
ATTORNEYS FEES PROVISIONS LET'S

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:29.621
NOT FORGET. THAT THERE IS AN

00:31:29.687 --> 00:31:31.155
INHERENT BALANCE THAT IS

00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:32.523
CREATED WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.459
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT. LAWYERS

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:36.094
GENERALLY WON'T TAKE A CASE

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.895
UNLESS THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE

00:31:37.962 --> 00:31:38.997
IS MERIT TO IT BECAUSE THEY

00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:41.032
WON'T GET PAID. AND AS SOMEONE

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:43.334
WHO HAS PRACTICED LAW- YOU

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:45.803
DON'T. WANT TO TAKE THOSE CASES

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.639
BECAUSE THERE'S USUALLY NOT

00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:49.574
ONLY YOUR TIME THAT IS NOT

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.709
COMPENSATED BUT OUT OF POCKET

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:54.379
EXPENSES AS WELL. AND OF COURSE

00:31:54.445 --> 00:31:55.980
IF A SETTLEMENT IS REACHED- THE

00:31:56.047 --> 00:31:58.383
CASE IS RESOLVED AND- THAT'S

00:31:58.449 --> 00:32:00.752
WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE

00:32:00.818 --> 00:32:02.920
HAPPEN AND FRANKLY SOME OF US

00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:04.188
ARE HOPING THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:06.924
TO EVEN. UP THE SHOULD BE. COMP

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:09.027
WILL COMPLY. AND THAT'S THE

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:10.461
ULTIMATE GOAL IN IF YOU HAVE A

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:11.629
HEAVY CAMERA THAT'S THE

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:17.302
INCENTIVE. OFFER COMPLIANCE AND

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:20.905
CHANGED THE WORKING WELL SO

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:24.542
WITH THAT SENATOR MONNING. I

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.711

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.436
A MOTHER WHO HAS HE'S TAKING

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:42.670

EXCELLENT QUESTION SENATOR- ONE

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.156
THING THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER

WHEN A PARENT IS INCARCERATED

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:06.160

01:29:25.593 --> 01:29:31.432
PARENT TO IN MARCH. AND NOT

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:38.840

YES YEAH MA'AM IN A APPRECIATE

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:43.845
CLARIFICATION SO I AS A PANDERS

01:29:43.911 --> 01:29:47.014
IT THEN WE BE IF THE MOTHER

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:48.049
DOESN'T HAVE A WAY TO STOP THE

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:49.550
IN. FOR SUPPORT SHE WOULD HAVE

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:50.651
BEEN GETTING SHE WOULD THEN

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:52.887
HAVE TO GO AND SOME SORT OF-

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:54.255
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE WHICH I

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:56.124
BELIEVE IS WHAT YOU WERE.

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:58.326
RECOMMENDING OR SUGGESTING AND

01:29:58.392 --> 01:29:59.060
THE CHAIR SAID THAT YOU HAD

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:02.730
AGREED TO PUT A STUDY IN PLACE-

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:05.633
THOUGH THE STUDY- CERTAINLY

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:07.435
DOESN'T HELP THE CUSTODIAL

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:09.403
PARENT DURING THE TIME WHEN SHE

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:10.772
STILL NEEDS TO FEED HER

01:30:10.838 --> 01:30:12.373
CHILDREN INCLUDE HER CHILDREN

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.442
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT TAKE

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:16.844
PLACE SO I DON'T KNOW I THINK

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.946
THIS STUDY MIGHT COME A LITTLE.

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:19.580
CONSOLATION TO THE ACTUAL

01:30:19.647 --> 01:30:22.784
BECAUSE OF TO BE YOU KNOW.

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:24.218
SORRY FOR BEING A ABOUT THIS.

01:30:24.285 --> 01:30:26.154
THE I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:29.223
QUESTION- IT SAYS THIS DOES NOT

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:30.725
APPLY WERE THE INCARCERATED

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.827
INDIVIDUAL HAS THE ABILITY. TO

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.829
CONTINUE MAKING CHILD SUPPORT

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:37.732
PAYMENTS AND THAT- DOES THAT

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:40.434
MIRROR FEDERAL LAW. OKAY AND

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:42.203
THEN IT ALSO SAYS- IT DOES NOT

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.940
APPLY. WHERE INCARCERATION IS

01:30:46.007 --> 01:30:47.909
THE RESULT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:49.443
AGAINST THEIR SUPPORTED PARTY

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:52.046
OR CHILD IS DOES THAT ALSO MERE

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:52.914
FEDERAL LAW OR IS THAT

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:57.218
SOMETHING. THAT'S JUST STATE

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:57.852
LAW. I'LL HAVE TO THE BY TO YOU

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:58.486
ON ONE I BELIEVE IN THEIR STATE

01:30:58.553 --> 01:30:59.987
LAW BUT LET ME DOUBLE CHECK ON

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:01.856
A STEER YOU IN THE WRONG OKAY

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:03.357
AND IT'S JUST A MISTAKE

01:31:03.424 --> 01:31:05.226
VIOLENCE SO NO WEATHER SO IN

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:05.960
OTHER WORDS IF THERE WERE ANY

01:31:06.027 --> 01:31:08.196
SORT OF SEXUAL ABUSE. THAT'S

01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:10.731
NOT FACTORED INTO THIS LIVE

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:12.767
USES FACTORED INTO IT. OKAY IT

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:13.935
IS FACTORS OR ANYTHING ELSE

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:15.236
FACTORED IN THAT. I DON'T HAVE

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:18.472
IN FRONT I DON'T I JUST HAVE A

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:19.073
DOMESTIC ABUSE IN FRONT OF ME

DOMESTIC PEOPLE SERVING PRISON

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:32.587
TIME FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:31:32.653 --> 01:31:35.289
ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS

01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:36.591
FOR AUTOMATICALLY SUSPENDED

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:37.992
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:39.760
SITUATION WOULD APPLY TO THEM

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.629

YOU AGREE TO WITH THAT GIVE US

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:48.703
REPORT ON THE IMPACT THAT.

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:50.705
ALLOWING THE DEBT BURDEN TO

01:31:50.771 --> 01:31:52.006
CONTINUE ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:52.874
BEEN CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.909
VIOLENCE AND MONTHS SAID AND

THE NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS WHAT

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:58.913
THAT IMPACT MAY HAVE WANTS TO

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:01.849
RELEASE FOR PAYING CHILD

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:04.352
SUPPORT. FINDING A JOB DOING

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:05.419
ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS I DON'T

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:06.954
KNOW ITS ACT READ THE AMENDMENT

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.856
BUT IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:10.892
THAT IT'S ASKING FOR THOSE

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:11.926
IMPACTS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF

01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:13.861
THAT WAS. DISCUSSED WITH YOU IN

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:16.264
THE CHAIR WELL THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:16.998
HAS ALREADY BEEN RESEARCH ON

01:32:17.064 --> 01:32:19.567
THAT. AND THE RICHARD RESEARCH

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:22.303
DOES SHOW- THAT MOST OF THE

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:24.405
CHILD SUPPORT THAT COMES FROM

01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:26.140
PARENTS MAKING LESS THAN TEN

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:27.875
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:31.078
THAT- WHAT WE'VE DONE NOW IS

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:33.147
THERE ON TOP OF THE REAR RIDGE

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:38.886
IS A 10% INTEREST PENALTY. SO

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:40.187
OF THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT

01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:41.322
WHEN A PERSON COMES OUT OF

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:43.658
PRISON. GET BACK ON THEIR FEET

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:45.993
THEY ARE THEY PERCEIVE THAT

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.895
THEY ARE IN SUCH ENORMOUS DEBT.

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:50.031
THAT FREQUENTLY THEY WON'T THAT

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:53.134
DAY. DISASSOCIATE FROM ANY KIND

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.101
OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR

01:32:54.168 --> 01:32:56.003
CHILDREN THAT'S FINANCIALLY

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:57.905
BASED THE ROOM BARROW STORE

01:32:57.972 --> 01:32:59.073
THERE ARE DATE THEY FEEL

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.741
INADEQUATE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:03.244
PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES AND

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:05.613
THAT- THEY DON'T REUNITE WITH

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.415
THEIR FAMILY SO WOULD IT

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:08.149
APPARENTLY INCREASES

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:10.651
RECIDIVISM. ME TO IT'S A LOSE

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:13.854
LOSE SITUATION I MEAN I SEE

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:14.355
THAT WERE YOU KNOW WE'RE

BEEN CONVICTED OF A DOMESTIC

01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:26.934
VIOLENCE AND I'M JUST THINKING

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:30.204
THAT. DAY THE POLICY GOALS FOR

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.106
THE GOALS WE STAYED OF FREE

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:34.709
REUNIFICATION AND MAKING SURE

01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:35.810
THAT ONCE THEY'RE OUT. THEIR

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:38.179
BEHAVIORS IMPROVE THAT THEY PAY

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:40.348
WHATEVER THE AMOUNT WAS JUST

01:33:40.414 --> 01:33:41.949
WONDERFUL SHOULD BE STARTING

01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:44.518

INTO ALL THE OTHER CATEGORIES

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:53.160
EXCEPT FOR THE CRIME THAT THEY

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:56.263

MAJORITY OF PARENTS WANT TO

REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES

01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:09.503
THEY WANT TO BE A PART OF THEIR

01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:12.440
CHILD'S LIFE. BUT THE BURDENS

01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:13.674
THAT THEY ENCOUNTER ALONG THE

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:17.678
WAY ARE SO HIGH. THEY'RE COMING

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:19.747
OUT OF PRISON DURING PULLED IT.

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:23.851
NO JOBS LACK OF HOUSING AN

OPPORTUNITIES IT IS OUR

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:29.690
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

EVERY MEMBER OF SOCIETY. WHO

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:33.961
HAVE CLEARLY PAID THEIR DEBT TO

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:36.664
SOCIETY AND WANTS TO RENO TO

AGENDA THAT HELPS FAMILIES AT

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:55.783
THE END OF THE DAY MADAM CHAIR

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:57.184
I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE

01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:59.186
WERE SAYING EXACT THAT'S TRUE

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:00.654
FOR EVERY THING EXCEPT FOR THE

01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:02.490
PERSON WHO SERVING TIME FOR

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:04.358
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ABUSE AS

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.127
I UNDERSTAND THE BILL. I THINK

01:36:06.193 --> 01:36:07.194
THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T WANT TO

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:10.498
CREATE ANY POTENTIAL IN SAN.

01:36:10.564 --> 01:36:12.533
SOMEONE COMMITTED A STICK FILA

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.802
AND GETS THE OPPORTUNITY IS A

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:16.270
RESULT OF THAT TO AVOID THE

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:17.938
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYING CHILD

01:36:18.005 --> 01:36:20.207
SUPPORT. THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM

01:36:20.274 --> 01:36:21.976
RIGHT RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY I'M

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:24.044
I'M NOT. I'M JUST RAISING THE

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:25.513
ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:28.015
IS. THIS IS A- AND JERRY THE

01:36:28.082 --> 01:36:30.684
LAW THAT WE TEND TO WE DON'T.

01:36:30.751 --> 01:36:32.686
ISN'T PICKY. A SITUATION WHERE

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:34.788
PEOPLE ARE ABUSING THEIR LOVED

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:37.525
ONES AND WE THINK YOU GET

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:38.459
THROWN IN JAIL AND- PART OF THE

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:40.828
GOAL HERE IS THAT REUNIFICATION

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:42.897
AND BRINGING PEOPLE BACK IN.

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:45.199
AND I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S- I

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:46.233
WOULD SAY TO CARPOOL BUT THIS

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.869

SHARING DISCUSSION OR EVERY

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:27.973
NUMBER OF YEARS- I'M SURPRISED

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.642
JUST BY VIRTUE OF LOCAL CONTROL

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:31.711

02:02:42.688 --> 02:02:44.523
FOR- THAT CONSIDER CROSS

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:46.058
AMERICAN SINCE THIS NOT EVIDENT

02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:48.294
IN THESE OTHER. CITIES THAT THE

CHAIR REFERENCE AS A

02:02:49.695 --> 02:02:51.130
CONSEQUENCE THE BILL HAS BEEN

02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:52.932
NARROWED TO EXCLUDE THEM. ALL

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:55.668
RIGHT- I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:59.271
IF THIS HAPPENS IN SAN DIEGO-

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:01.941
WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE THAT-

02:03:02.007 --> 02:03:03.743
THE CITY OF FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:05.177
IS GOING TO WANT TO HAVE-

02:03:05.244 --> 02:03:06.412
SOMETHING DIFFERENT- FRESNO

02:03:06.479 --> 02:03:08.047
COUNTY OR JUST ACROSS THE

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:12.618

PARTICULAR FOR THE RECORD

02:03:34.807 --> 02:03:37.276
BECAUSE UP FRESNO CANNOT BRING

02:03:37.343 --> 02:03:38.511
THESE KINDS OF ACTIONS UNDER

02:03:38.577 --> 02:03:39.678
STATE LAW CURRENTLY IS TOO

02:03:39.745 --> 02:03:42.248
SMALL. SO IT'S ONLY CITIES OF

SEVENTY THOUSAND OR MORE SO IF

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:44.683

COVET YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT

02:03:49.688 --> 02:03:50.823
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE BEING

02:03:50.890 --> 02:03:52.925
SQUEEZED IN THIS PANDEMIC AND

02:03:52.992 --> 02:03:54.426
THEIR REVENUES ARE PLAN. MAKING

02:03:54.493 --> 02:03:57.062
AND HAVING TO CHOOSE VERY VOCAL.

02:03:57.129 --> 02:03:58.097
FORTIES ABOUT WHAT TO PERSON

02:03:58.164 --> 02:03:59.832
WHAT NOT TO PURSUE TO THE

02:03:59.899 --> 02:04:01.267
EXTENT THAT OUR CITY ATTORNEY

02:04:01.333 --> 02:04:03.202
HE HEARD FROM A MOMENT AGO IS

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:06.105
ACTIVELY HAND COLLUDED CONSUMER

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:08.107
PROTECTION CASES BUT HAS TO

02:04:08.174 --> 02:04:09.642
JUDGE ON THE FACT THAT IF SHE

02:04:09.708 --> 02:04:12.211
SPENDS A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:04:12.278 --> 02:04:15.147
DOLLARS IN DOING IT. SHE'LL FOR

02:04:15.214 --> 02:04:21.187
THE REVENUE BACK SO. FOR SHADI

02:04:21.253 --> 02:04:23.155
TESTING. THROUGH DOING I DID

02:04:23.222 --> 02:04:24.323
DRIVE OF OPERATIONS CHARGING

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:26.225
CUTS NOT DOING CALL TEST. ARTS

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:27.059
TWENTY WANTS TO PASS THAT THE

02:04:27.126 --> 02:04:27.927
RIGHT NOW SHE ONLY GETS HOW OF

02:04:27.993 --> 02:04:29.461
THE- THAT COMES TO THE PROJECT.

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:31.030
THE COMES AFTERWARDS AND IF THE

02:04:31.096 --> 02:04:32.364
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO THE SAME

02:04:32.431 --> 02:04:34.934
THING SHE GETS. NOTHING SO I

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.569
HUMBLY SUGGEST THAT THIS TIME

02:04:36.635 --> 02:04:37.937
WITH CONSUMERS ARE BEING

02:04:38.003 --> 02:04:40.773
SQUEEZED BY UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS.

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:41.774
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE OUR

02:04:41.841 --> 02:04:43.008
PUBLIC WATCHDOGS AFTER DOING

02:04:43.075 --> 02:04:44.610
THE WORK AND THIS WILL MAKE IT

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:46.245
MORE LIKELY AND BECAUSE THE

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:47.713
REVENUES UPON MANY ACTION MAKES

02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:49.548
IT LESS LIKELY WITHOUT THIS

02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:51.217
LEGISLATION. I WILL CERTAINLY

02:04:51.283 --> 02:04:53.419
APPLAUD THAT EFFORT TO DRAW A

02:04:53.485 --> 02:04:56.222
NEXUS OUGHT TO COVERED AS

02:04:56.288 --> 02:04:59.491
UNIQUE AND CREATIVE AS IT WAS.

02:04:59.558 --> 02:05:02.061
AND WHAT IF. BIGGIE GETS BACK

02:05:02.127 --> 02:05:04.296
THE- THE OVERALL ON THE OVERALL

02:05:04.363 --> 02:05:06.365
IMPORT OF THIS IS WHETHER IT'S

02:05:06.432 --> 02:05:08.934
LIMITED TO COUNTIES OVER SEVEN

HUNDRED THOUSAND OR CITIES

02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:13.372
RATHER- THE IDEA OF CREATING A

02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:16.008
CONTEST BETWEEN MUNICIPALITIES

02:05:16.075 --> 02:05:18.277

BE. HAVING SERVED AT THE LOCAL

03:11:18.700 --> 03:11:20.802
AMERICANS BE IN A POSITION TO

03:11:20.869 --> 03:11:23.004
SEEK REDRESS. UNDER THE

03:11:23.071 --> 03:11:25.140
CIRCUMSTANCES WE FIND OURSELVES

03:11:25.207 --> 03:11:28.777
IN AS AMERICANS. IT'S ONLY FAIR.

03:11:28.844 --> 03:11:33.515
HERE'S MY REQUEST TO. THE

03:11:33.582 --> 03:11:34.883
AUTHOR PERHAPS A BIT WILL BE

03:11:34.950 --> 03:11:40.622
THROUGH. THE CENTER BRADFORD- I

03:11:40.689 --> 03:11:43.458
THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE

03:11:43.525 --> 03:11:45.427
FOR A BODY TO BE CONVENED TO

03:11:45.493 --> 03:11:48.930
STUDY THIS ISSUE. I'D SURPRISE

03:11:48.997 --> 03:11:53.235
THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE- BY OTHER

03:11:53.301 --> 03:11:55.170
STATES MAYBE IT HAS BEEN I

03:11:55.237 --> 03:11:57.138
DON'T I DON'T NOW. BUT HERE'S

03:11:57.205 --> 03:11:58.273
WHAT I WOULD WANT TO SEE

03:11:58.340 --> 03:12:00.675
DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PROPOSED

03:12:00.742 --> 03:12:04.913
CONSTITUTION OF THIS GROUP. IS

03:12:04.980 --> 03:12:06.748
RIGHT NOW THE APPOINTMENTS

03:12:06.815 --> 03:12:08.884
WOULD BE FROM THE GOVERNOR AND

03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:10.685
THE LEADERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND

03:12:10.752 --> 03:12:14.623
THE SENATE. WHAT I DON'T SEE I

03:12:14.689 --> 03:12:16.858
THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL JUST AS

03:12:16.925 --> 03:12:20.028
WE'VE- LOOK AT SOUTH AFRICA

03:12:20.095 --> 03:12:22.330
CAMBODIA ARMENIA AND ELSEWHERE

03:12:22.397 --> 03:12:23.565
AROUND THE WORLD WE'VE HAD

03:12:23.632 --> 03:12:26.768
THESE CATASTROPHES IS THAT WHEN

03:12:26.835 --> 03:12:28.503
A GROUP IS CONVENE. THESE

03:12:28.570 --> 03:12:31.339
INDIVIDUALS BE PROPERLY

03:12:31.406 --> 03:12:35.944
SCHOOLED AND- ARE DISCIPLINED

03:12:36.011 --> 03:12:37.512
ON MATTERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO

03:12:37.579 --> 03:12:40.882
THE BODY ITSELF. SO HERE'S MY

03:12:40.949 --> 03:12:42.717
RECOMMENDATION WOULD THE AUTHOR

03:12:42.784 --> 03:12:47.122
CONSIDER. THAT THE EIGHT

03:12:47.188 --> 03:12:51.359
APPOINTMENTS. BE EXPANDED I

03:12:51.426 --> 03:12:54.429
DON'T KNOW TO WHAT AMOUNT. BUT

03:12:54.496 --> 03:12:56.731
THAT IT INCLUDE COMPARED OF LAW

03:12:56.798 --> 03:12:59.935
EXPERTS. INNING THE REASON I

03:13:00.001 --> 03:13:02.904
BRING THAT UP IS BECAUSE- THE

03:13:02.971 --> 03:13:05.440
REPORT ON THE CREATION OF THIS.

03:13:05.507 --> 03:13:08.443
COMMISSION TALKS ABOUT. THIS

03:13:08.510 --> 03:13:10.712
UNITED NATIONS ORGANS IN

03:13:10.779 --> 03:13:12.247
DIFFERENT TREES AND OTHER

03:13:12.314 --> 03:13:15.083
OBLIGATIONS TO UNDERSTAND HOW

03:13:15.150 --> 03:13:18.787
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE THIS.

03:13:18.853 --> 03:13:20.889
SO COMPARED OF LAW EXPERT.

03:13:20.956 --> 03:13:22.757
SOMEONE EXPERIENCED IN FOR

03:13:22.824 --> 03:13:26.328
EXAMPLE AS A HOLOCAUST SCHOLAR.

03:13:26.394 --> 03:13:27.862
OR SOUTH AFRICAN APARTHEID

03:13:27.929 --> 03:13:30.665
SCHOLAR THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE

03:13:30.732 --> 03:13:32.500
A BACKGROUND IN DEALING WITH

03:13:32.567 --> 03:13:36.471
REPARATIONS BUT THIS IS NOT.

03:13:36.538 --> 03:13:38.873
JUST A- NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

03:13:38.940 --> 03:13:40.575
APPOINTED BY THE PRO TEM THE

03:13:40.642 --> 03:13:42.577
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THE GOVERNOR

03:13:42.644 --> 03:13:45.313
AND LASTLY IT WOULD BE THAT

03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:46.815
THERE BE A POLITICAL CROSS

03:13:46.881 --> 03:13:48.783
SECTION REPRESENTED HERE.

03:13:48.850 --> 03:13:50.352
BECAUSE IF IT'S JUST THOSE

03:13:50.418 --> 03:13:51.753
THREE ENTITIES MAKING THE

03:13:51.820 --> 03:13:54.222
APPOINTMENT. I THINK IT WOULD

03:13:54.289 --> 03:13:57.125
BENEFIT. THE COMMISSION OR THIS

03:13:57.192 --> 03:14:00.462
COUNCIL. THAT BODY IN BENEFIT

03:14:00.528 --> 03:14:02.897
ALL OF US IF WE HAD SOME

03:14:02.964 --> 03:14:07.168
REPRESENTATION THAT REPRESENTED.

03:14:07.235 --> 03:14:09.204
THE CROSS SECTION OF OUR

03:14:09.270 --> 03:14:12.874
POLITICAL SYSTEM. I THINK DOES

03:14:12.941 --> 03:14:15.410
A REASONABLE REQUEST I DON'T

03:14:15.477 --> 03:14:16.911
KNOW IF I'D LIKE TO LEAVE IT

03:14:16.978 --> 03:14:21.116
OPEN TO. BOB THE PRESENTER I

03:14:21.182 --> 03:14:23.051
THINK THIS HAS A LOT OF MERIT.

03:14:23.118 --> 03:14:25.587
I'M SCARED. THAT IF THE

03:14:25.653 --> 03:14:28.656
COMPOSITION IS NOT. ALL TO

03:14:28.723 --> 03:14:30.825
MODIFY. DATA WON'T BE IS AS IT

03:14:30.892 --> 03:14:33.728
NEED TO BE AND I'M ALSO AFRAID

03:14:33.795 --> 03:14:36.064
THAT WILL UNNECESSARILY IGNITE

03:14:36.131 --> 03:14:39.401
PARTISAN PASSIONS. THAT I THINK

03:14:39.467 --> 03:14:42.337
ARE INAPPROPRIATE. SOME SOME

03:14:42.404 --> 03:14:43.938
MANAGER DO YOU MIND IF I

03:14:44.005 --> 03:14:47.275
THROUGH YOU. HOSE THAT REQUEST

03:14:47.342 --> 03:14:50.712
TO THE PRESENTER. I SIR THE

03:14:50.779 --> 03:14:52.747
PRESENTER CAN COMMENT ON IT IN

03:14:52.814 --> 03:14:55.183
HIS CLOTHES A BOAT YOU KNOW WE

03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:58.553
DON'T NEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF

03:14:58.620 --> 03:15:00.088
THE BILL IN ADVANCE BUT I DO

03:15:00.155 --> 03:15:02.424
BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONS IN

03:15:02.490 --> 03:15:04.225
THE BILL CALL FOR EIGHT PEOPLE

03:15:04.292 --> 03:15:07.195
ARE AND THAT THEY CANNOT ALL BE

03:15:07.262 --> 03:15:08.663
OF THE SAME PARTY SO BAD THAT
