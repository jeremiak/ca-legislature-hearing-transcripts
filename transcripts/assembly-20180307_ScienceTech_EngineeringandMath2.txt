FOR OUR SELECT COMMITTEE ON STEM WE'RE GOING TO WORKING ON CHANGING THE NAME OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO STEAM BECAUSE WE THINK THAT ARTS PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE FUTURE. AND IF I DISAGREE WITH CALLING IT SEEMS THAT A STEM. WELL I WISH YOU COULD GO BACK AND NATION A WELCOME TO OUR HEARING. PLEASE BE JOINED BY OUR COLLEAGUES WILL BE MAKING SOME REMARKS IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS. I'M MY NAME IS TONY THURMOND I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHARING OUR STEM COMMITTEE. UP WE WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW. HOW WE ALIGN EDUCATION HOW TO REALIGN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE HOW WE MAKE SURE THE GETTING THE RIGHT EXPERIENCES? HOW WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY IN THE WORKFORCE HOW DO WE ADD TO THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR FOR WOMEN? AND FOR OTHERS TO BE INVOLVED IN JOBS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE KNOW WILL SUPPORT OUR ECONOMY SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES. SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN THEM IN THEIR ABILITY TO WORK IN THEIR FAMILIES ALSO WE ARE PLEASED IT YOU'RE HERE TODAY. TO JOIN US FOR THIS CONVERSATION I'M WE HAVE SEVERAL. IMPRESSIVE SPEAKERS TODAY. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE BEEN ASSET EVERYBODY GIVE KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW. SO WE CAN SAY THE MAJORITY THE TIME FOR CONVERSATION IN QUESTION AND DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE WE NEED TO GO NEXT. SO HAVING SAID THAT ALLOW ME TO WELCOME YOU HOW I TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON WHO MAKE A FEW REMARKS AT THE. THANK. S. A DELIGHT TO BE WITH YOU. HERE TODAY AND. TO SHARE THAT PASSION THAT YOU HAVE FOR EDUCATION AND SPECIFICALLY TODAY TO HEAR ABOUT US STEM OR SHALL WE SAY STEAM. AND. THERE ARE SOME THINGS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING. ABOUT AND AND ONE OF THOSE. QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE THAT THAT. KINDA RULES OVER MY MIND IS THE IS THE EFFORT THAT IS BEING MADE IN THE EDUCATION UNIVERSE. ON HOW WE ARE ADDRESSING. SHALL I SAY STEEN BUT WE WE AS. THE CHAIR AND I COME FROM A REGION. THAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE OF THE GLOBAL LEADER IN TECHNOLOGY THAT PUTS A DEMAND UP ON A WORK FORCE THAT REQUIRES TRAINING IN SCIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL ANALOGY ENGINEERING MATH. AND INCLUDING THE ARTS. AND SO WITH THAT WHAT EFFORTS. ARE HAPPENING WITH IN THE EDUCATION UNIVERSE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS THAT EXIST IN OUR IN OUR REGIONS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SPECIFICALLY FROM WHERE I'M COMING FROM. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I I KNOW WAS AT THE FOREFRONT OF MY MIND IS ACCESS TO STEM. AND WHEN I TALK ABOUT ACCESS TO STEM WHETHER IT'S AN A FLUENT. SCHOOL DISTRICT VERSUS ON UNDERSERVED OR WHETHER IT'S. THE GENDER DISPARITY OR EVEN IN RACE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL YOU HAVE. FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS FAR ARE ABLE TO ACCESS STEM EDUCATION AND THEN THE ANOTHER ISSUE THE PRESSES. MY MIND WOULD BE BAD THE ISSUE WHERE THE BUSINESS AND EMPLOYER SECTOR HAVE ACCESS TO A POOL OF WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN WELL TRAINED WELL EQUIPPED. AND ARE READY TO WORK. IN A STEM ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN EDUCATED AND TRAINED IN A STEM ENVIRONMENT SO. LOOKING FOR TO HEARING YOUR COMMENTS TODAY FROM THE EXPERTS. THANK YOU SIMILAR GRAYSON FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO STAND INTO STEAM ALSO WERE HONORED TO BE JOINED BY COLLEAGUE WHO'S BEEN A LEADER ON ISSUES RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING IN REMARKS AFTER LISTENING TO MICHELLE PULPIT YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I. WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR OPENING TO SELL HEARING TOGETHER. ARE IN FACT JUST YESTERDAY I HAD A HEARING ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE A WHICH IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT PROMISES TO TRANSFORM THE WORK. PLACES SO IN THE FUTURE. AND OUT ONE OF THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAS A. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE PREPARE OUR. AFFORD THIS TRANSFORMATION AND ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS WAS THAT WE NEED TO TRAIN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE IN A COMPUTER SCIENCE AND STEM RELATED FIELD AND AND THAT'S THE VERY ESSENCE OF STEM AND THAT. THE RELEVANCE OF TODAY'S HEARING SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS FOR JOINING US TODAY AND. BEFORE TO YOUR TESTIMONIES IS OFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH OUT OF WE HAVE. A NUMBER OF PANELISTS TODAY. WILL BE JOINED BY MEMBERS. AS ABLE TO ON THEIR NUMBER OF PRESENTATIONS. PROTESTS PROCLAMATIONS YOU NAME IT THEY'RE ALL HAPPENING. AND SO MEMBERS WILL KIND OF COME IN AND OUT AS THEY ARE ABLE TO. BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU AND. BEFORE FIRST PANEL OUT WERE HONORED ON TO HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF CAL STATE EAST BAY DOCTOR THE WAY MORISHITA. WE'RE ALSO HONORED TO HAVE THE EXACT DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR STEM EDUCATION TRINA OSTRANDER. THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AT CAL STATE EAST BAY DR CAROLYN NELSON. AND FROM THE ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WEBER EDUCATORS DONALD CONNOR OF THAT WELCOME AND WITH THAT I GOT MORE SHEET IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR THURMOND AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON STEAM EDUCATION. GLAD TO BE HERE I'M HERE MARIE STEP PRESIDENT CAL STATE EAST BAY. AND SO YOU MAY WONDER WHY IS A PRESIDENT OF A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT SEEM EDUCATION AND THE URGENCY OF IMPROVING. MATH EDUCATION FOR PRESCHOOLERS. EVERY YEAR MANY STUDENTS ARRIVE AT CAL STATE EAST BAY. UNPREPARED FOR MATHEMATICS. AND WE NEED TO SEE IF WE CAN HELP THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE STRUGGLE TAKES THEM EXTRA TIME EXTRA EFFORT. IN LONGER AND MORE EXPENSE. CAN CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. AND I'M HERE BECAUSE CAL STATE EAST BAY IS AT THE CENTER OF A REGIONAL ECOSYSTEM. THAT IS WORKING TO FIND WAYS TO SUCCESSFULLY PREPARE. ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND FOR US TO DELIVER ON THAT MESSAGE. OUR RESEARCH IN PRACTICE HAS PROVEN THAT WHEN WE START EARLY. WE CAN CLEAR AWAY A LOT OF THE BARRIERS THAT OUR STUDENTS FIND ALONG THEIR PATH TO COLLEGE AND CAREERS IN THE FIELDS. OF THEIR CHOOSING. SO CAL STATE EAST BAY HAS BECOME A LEADER IN STEM EDUCATION AS A MATTER OF EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY. FOR OUR STUDENTS WHO COMPRISE THE MOST DIVERSE PUBLIC FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES. AND WE STRIVE TO DELIVER A REGIONAL WORKFORCE AS YOU'RE ASKING FOR THAT POWERS ARE INNOVATIVE INCREASINGLY STEM BASED ECONOMY. WHAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT IN ADDITION TO SERVING OUR STUDENTS THE C. ISSUES ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES ARE CHARGED HIM HEARING CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS? TKA THROUGH FOURTEEN BOTH IN SERVICE AND UNDERGRADS. IN THESE DUAL ROLES CASTING EAST BAY HAS BEEN ENGAGED FOR YEARS IN INNOVATIVE COLLABORATION TO BIG STRONG STEM EDUCATION TO OUR DIVERSE REGIONS. ONE OF THESE IS THE SPACE STEM NETWORK. ACROSS SECTOR COLLABORATION WITH EDUCATORS COMMUNITY MEMBERS INDUSTRY LEADERS AND POLICY MAKERS. THE NETWORK BEGAN ITS INNOVATIVE WORK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WITH A ROAD MAP TO STUDENT SUCCESS. HONING IN ON FOR PRIORITIES. EARLY EDUCATION. OUT OF SCHOOL TIME. STUDIES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS IN HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE TRANSITIONS. TODAY'S RECOMMENDATIONS SIGNED BY LEADERS IN EDUCATION INDUSTRY AND OUR COMMUNITIES CAME OUT OF THE NETWORK'S EARLY EDUCATION WORKING GROUP. THESE EXPERTS EXAMINE THE COMPELLING RESEARCH. SHOWING THE PROFOUND IMPORTANCE OF EARLY MATH TWO ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN ALL DISCIPLINES. THEY CONVENE CONFERENCES AND ISSUE REPORTS WHICH HAVE BEGUN TO HAVE IMPACT AMONG TEACHERS AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO TODAY WE'RE HERE TO BE BRING TO YOU THIS KNOWLEDGE. HOPING FOR SYSTEMIC CHANGE TO BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MATH DEFEAT DEFICITS. THAT EXIST UPON ENTRY INTO KINDERGARTEN. CAN BE OVERCOME QUICKLY. WITH LASTING EFFECTS. OUR WORK WITH THE HE WOULD PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT TODAY. AS PUT THIS RESEARCH INTO PRACTICE THE REAL RESULTS ARE VERY VERY EXCITING. WE'RE PLEASED WE JOINED TODAY BY COLLEAGUES. TOGETHER WE ARE BUILDING IN AND DURING. NETWORK DEVOTED TO APPEARING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS FOR THE STEAM CAREERS THAT DRIVE OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT WE CAN MAKE A WELL PAYING STEM CAREER REALITY FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WHO SO CHOOSE THIS PATH BANKING? THANK YOU DOCTOR MARIE SHOULD I AND I I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHY WOULD PRESIDENT BE HERE. Y. WITH THE PRESIDENT BE HERE IN A SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT YOU BEING HERE IN THE DEAN BEING HERE. AND THE COMMITMENTS OF RC ISSUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SUCH AND THERE CERTAINLY SOMEONE'S BEEN NO STRANGER TO HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE PREPARE FOR JOBS AND TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE. BIOTECH WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HEARING FOR CALLING THE SKY CONFERENCE TOGETHER. I'M. I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE MATH POLICY STATEMENT THAT HAS COME OUT OF THE EAST BAY STEM. NETWORK BY AS DOCTOR MARCIA EXPLAINED THE NETWORK IS A CROSS SECTORAL. OF COLLABORATION THAT'S BEEN WORKING I'M FOR WHAT THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS. I AM ON DELIVERING QUALITY STEM EDUCATION STEAM EDUCATION TO OUR. ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE COUNTRY PRIDE REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY. SO THERE ARE POLICY STATEMENT IS THAT A PROCESS THAT A PRODUCT OF YEARS OF WORK IN COLLABORATION AND STUDY AND RESEARCH AND ACTIVISM. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE IN PACKETS YOU HAVE AND WE HAVE HARD COPIES FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS. MORE I'M JUST GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH IT VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO CAN TELL YOU ABOUT HOW THESE PRACTICES. HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. FIRST WE START WITH WHY IS EARLY NOW IMPORTANT SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THAT IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THINGS LIKE LITERACY. AND IT'S REALLY KEY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS ONE IS MATH PROFICIENCY AT KINDERGARTEN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AS IMPORTANT A PREDICTOR OF EARLY OF FUTURE ACADEMIC SUCCESS. IN ALL DISCIPLINES AS LITERACY. ARE AND YET IT'S TAUGHT A FRACTION OF THE AMOUNT. BY KINDERGARTEN THERE'S ALREADY A DEMONSTRATED ACHIEVEMENT GAP GUESS WHAT CORRELATED TO THINGS LIKE INCOME AND. ETHNIC. I BACKGROUND AND THOSE KINDS OF SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE GAP FIVE STARTS OUT A KINDERGARTEN AT TWENTY MONTHS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS WHO ARE LIKE SIXTEEN MONTHS OLD. AND THEY'VE GOT A TWENTY MONTH. HANDICAP WHEN THEY WHEN THEY GET TO FORMAL SCHOOLING KELLY GETS WORSE AS STUDENTS WHO FLEW WITH. A. A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL UNPREPARED. AS DOCTOR ARISTA POINTED OUT FOR COLLEGE LEVEL MATH. I THIS COST THEM TIME AND MONEY IS BOMB SOME OUT THEY GET DEPRESSED AND OFTEN THAT'S. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN NOT COMPLETING THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE IN SIX YEARS OR ANY OTHER NUMBER OF YEARS. I AS W KNOW CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS DRIVEN BY STEM STEAM BASED INDUSTRIES. THEIR ONE MILLION ENTRY LEVEL JOBS YEAH REQUIRE IT IN STEAM. DISCIPLINES COMING UP WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA. THE EMPLOYERS WHO'VE SIGNED ON TO OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDE AMPLE TESTIMONY ABOUT THE. I COME FROM BAYER CORPORATION YOU KNOW AND LEAD SORT OF CHARACTERIZE IT AS STARVATION MODE THAT EMPLOYERS ARE AND. FOR LOCAL TALENT ESPECIALLY IN A HIGH COST OF LIVING AREA LIKE THAT'S. I AND FINALLY CALIFORNIA RANKS AT THE BOTTOM THE HOUSE FOR YEARS. AYE FOR THINGS LIKE ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE COMPLETION ESPECIALLY AMONG STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO FIX THAT AND WE CAN'T. SO I A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE ACTUAL POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WINE IS TO BEGIN BY LAUNCHING A BROAD PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY MATH EDUCATION. AND HOW FUN IT CAN BE ARE AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IS A FACTOR IN FUTURE ADULTS SUCCESS. I DO TOO IS PROVIDE PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS WITH AFFORDABLE MATH EDUCATION RESOURCE SINCE. ARM AND AGAIN THAT ARE FUN MATH EDUCATION THAT AN EARLY AGE IS FUN. AYE TRACK I MEAN I'M AN ENGLISH MAJOR BUT IT MIGHT EVEN BE MORE FUN THAN LITERACY SO. GET WAY THAT YOU'VE GOT TO TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T KNOW IT BUT THAT'S THE POINT OF THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO GET THAT WORD OUT. AND FINALLY IT'S IN THIS GETS A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX BUT WE CAN DO IT. BY INCREASINGLY UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERTISE OF EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDERS ARM AND THAT'S STARTING IN PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE. IT MEANS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS. ARE IT MEANS RETHINKING CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS IN INCENTIVIZING PARTICIPATION. IT MEANS INSTITUTING MOSCOW'S ASSESSMENTS OF STUDENTS EARLY ON SO THAT WE CAN TELL WHAT'S WORKING AND WHERE THE GAPS NEED. TO BE FILLED. I THINK IT LEAVES ONE MORE THING. I KNOW BECAUSE IT'S SO THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE START. I DO NOT THIS COMPLETE SOLUTION TO STEM EDUCATION WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT MAYBE AT SOME OTHER FUTURE MEETING BUT THEY'RE DOABLE AND WOOD HEALED YOU ARE MISS RESULTS FOR STUDENTS IN ALL. AREAS OF STUDY. SEAN HOW IT WORKS. REGULAR SESSION AND THERE'D BE NELSON. LOOK YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS SHARE WITH YOU WHAT IT DOES TAKE. TO MAKE THIS WORK AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT SOME SCALE FOR. FOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES. HE WOULD PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR WHICH I'M THAT THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR. IS A CRADLE TO CAREER CROSS SECTOR PARTNERSHIP LED BY CAL STATE EAST BAY WHOSE PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO ALLEVIATE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF POVERTY. OF FOUR OUT COMES. OUTCOMES FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED TYPICALLY. AND AS THE LEAD AGENCY CSU EAST BAY COORDINATES ACTIVITIES SILICATES MEETINGS MONITORS PROTOCOLS. PRODUCT PERFORMS DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS AND AS A PARTNER. WE ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES BY ENGAGING OUR GREATEST ASSETS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FACULTY. THROUGH OUR THROUGH OUR SERVICE LEARNING INTERNSHIPS THAT WE OFFER THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. AND WE ALSO PROVIDE COMMUNITY COUNSELING CLINIC SERVICES FOR AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT IS THE MOST CHALLENGING FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. BOB MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO. WE ARE A PARTNER AS WELL AS THE LEAD AGENCY. HEY REPUBLIC STABLE HOOD IS THE COMMUNITY BASED INITIATIVE THAT RECEIVED A PROMISED NEIGHBORHOOD AWARD IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. AND WE WERE WHEN THE FIRST FIVE INITIATIVES IN THE COUNTRY WE WERE THE ONLY PUBLIC UNIVERSITY TO LEAD ONE OF THE AWARDS. SO I THINK THAT A PART OF IT HAD A LOT OF FAITH IN THE COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS THE UNIVERSITY WEREN'T SURE IF UNIVERSITIES SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN THIS WORK I SAY. UNIVERSITIES MUST BE ENGAGED IN THIS WORK THIS IS THE WORK. OF EDUCATION. A. WE'RE ALSO. LET'S SEE WE ENDED THIS GRANT IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THE DATA THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TODAY IS FROM THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. OF OUR WORK WE HAD A TRANSITION YEAR. AND BASED ON THE COMMITMENT OF OUR PARTNERS WE ALL WE ALL HUNG TOGETHER APPLIED FOR ANOTHER AWARD AND RECEIVED THE GOOD NEWS JERRY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT WE WERE A SECOND A WORDY. TO SCALE UP THE WORK TO A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD UP THREE SENSES CAME UP THREE CENSUS BLOCK AREA. THAT IT'S IN THE TENNIS AND QUARTER NOW. SO BUT I BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF THIS WORK IS DUE IN PART TO THE INTENTIONALITY OF THE COLLABORATIVE HAD. TO WORK DIFFERENTLY TOGETHER. NOW WE'VE HAD COLLABORATIVE AND GRANT AWARDS FOR DECADES. BUT WHAT IS IT DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS IS WHAT WE TELL YOU WHAT IS TO TRADITIONAL. USUALLY PARTNERS ARE GIVEN AN AWARD EVEN IF YOU REQUIRE COLLABORATION THERE GIVEN AN AWARD. AND THEN EVERY PARTNER GOES OFF PERFORMS ITS SERVICES PROVIDES ITS IT SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY AND MAYBE THEY'LL MEASURE IT AND THEN PEOPLE OFTEN WORK THE SAME AS IF THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TOGETHER. AND SO WE HAVE WHICH A TYPICALLY HAVE IS PROVIDING INTERVENTIONS THAT ONLY HAVE ISOLATED IMPACT. OKAY AND AND WHAT WE HAVE REALLY WORKED HARD TO DO. IS CREATE COLLECTIVE IMPACT AS AN ORGANIZATION OF THE COLLABORATIVE TO PERFORM LARGE SCALE. SOCIAL CHANGE NOT TO PERFORM IT TO ENABLE IT. OKAY. AND THE SEARCHING THROUGH THE STRATEGIC COORDINATION OF SERVICES. MUTUALLY REINFORCING ACTIVITIES AND ALIGNMENT OF SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN DUPLICATION OF SOLUTIONS BECAUSE ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOW PART OF THIS WORK WE STARTED WITH TEN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. WE'RE NOW UP TO FOURTEEN. AND THIS NEW BODY OF WORK SOME OTHER FOR OUR FUNDED SOME OF THEM ARE NOT. BUT THEY'VE ALL COMMITTED TO SHARING DATA. THEY'VE ALL COMMITTED TO REVIEWING THE DATA. AND WE SHARE THE DATA WITH THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY'RE TELLING US WHAT'S WORKING WHAT ISN'T. BUT OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FOR COMMUNICATION SUPPORT ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE PIPELINE. AND WHERE WHERE THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OCCURS ACROSS THE NETWORKS. SO THIS IS COLLABORATION WITH THE CAPITAL CITY. ON THE BILL EARLY LEARNING NETWORK IS ONE OF OUR WORK ON NETWORKS THAT HAS DATA THAT I WILL BE SHARING WITH YOU IN JUST A SECOND. THE SECOND NETWORK IS OUR CRADLE TO CAREER EDUCATIONAL REFORM NETWORK AND THE THIRD WORK NETWORK IS THE NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH AND EMPOWERMENT NETWORK. WHERE EACH NETWORK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDRESSING ONE OR MORE OF OUR TENT OUTCOMES BENCHMARK BY FIFTEEN INDICATORS? PARTNER MEETINGS INCLUDING OUR ADVISORY BOARD WHICH IS PRIMARILY MADE UP PARENTS IN THE COMMUNITY COALESCE. AROUND DATA. AND THE IMPACT OF THE SERVICES OFFERED. INSTEAD OF SAYING THIS IS MY FAVORITE SERVICE SO YOU HAVE TO LIKE IT. WERE AFTER HIM DO THAT WORKING AND SO WE CENTER OUR CONVERSATIONS AROUND A RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK THAT ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS. HOW MUCH DID IT TO? HOW WELL DID WE DO IT? AND BY THE WAY IS ANYBODY BETTER OFF. THAT'S A KEY QUESTION THAT'S OFTEN LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION. SO. LET'S SEE JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME LET ME JUST. JUMPED TO THE PERCENT OF INTERNS O.. BARTLETT EARLY LEARNING NETWORK I THINK IS PART OF YOUR PACKET. YOU HAVE SOME INFO GRAPHICS BUT I'D LIKE TO JUST HIGHLIGHT IT WON'T READ EVERYTHING ON THERE TO YOUR POINT OUT EVERYTHING. IN YOUR SPARE TIME. ASSUMING YOU EVER HAD ANY YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT THESE BUT I THINK THEY SPEAK LOUDLY ABOUT. THE KEY. HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS WORKING DIFFERENTLY TOGETHER LEVERAGING EACH OTHER'S WORK LEVERAGING EACH OTHER'S MONEY NO WE DON'T ALL HAVE TO PERFORM THE SAME ACTIVITY WEEP? WE PERFORM INTERVENTIONS THAT WORK BEST AND WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT RATHER THAN RECREATING THE WHEEL ACROSS ALL PARTNERS. NOT SO TRADITIONAL THAT IS SO TYPICAL OF WHAT HAPPENS TO IT FOR GRANT MONEY IN OUR FEES. OKAY SO TAKE A LOOK AT THE EARLY LEARNING NETWORK. AUSTIN'S OUR FOCUS IN THIS CONVERSATION'S BEEN ON EARLY MATH. AND THIS NEW POLICY RECOMMENDATION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THEY ABOUT TEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED RESIDENTS. THERE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND LEVIN TWELVE LABOR NO PRESCHOOLS. NO PRESCHOOL. AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THERE'RE A HUNDRED AND NINETY SLOTS NOW FOR PRESCHOOL. WHATEVER OUTCOMES IS NOT JUST ANY OLD PRESCHOOL WE'RE TALKING QUALITY PRESCHOOLS IT'S NOT A PLACE TO HOUSE CHILDREN. IS THE PLACE TO HELP CHILDREN GROW. AND DEVELOP. AND THE CHILDREN ENTER KINDERGARTEN READY TO SUCCEED SO IT'S NOT JUST HOUSING THEM IT IS MAKING SURE THAT WHEN THEY ARE THERE. THEY LEARN AND ARE PREPARED TO SUCCEED IN KINDERGARTEN SO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCORES. THESE PERCENTAGES. THEY ARE MEASURED BY THE D. RDP WHICH IS ACTUALLY AN ASSESSMENT PUT TOGETHER BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THE EARLY CHILDHOOD. COALITION. AND THE D. RDP HAS TOLD US THAT IN KINDERGARTEN WHEN THE CHILDREN FIRST GET THERE FROM MORE HERE PROMISE TO BIRDS PRESCHOOLS. NINETY TWO PERCENT OF THEM ARE READY TO ENTER KINDERGARTEN TO SUCCEED IN MATHEMATICS. IN SCIENCE EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THEM ARE READY TO SUCCEED. AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT EMERGES OUT OF GOOD HANDS ON QUALITY ACTIVITIES. LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT NINETY THREE PERCENT AND LITERACY DEVELOPMENT NINETY TWO PERCENT. YOU KNOW FIGURE SOMETHING KID SOMETHING INTERESTING TO ENGAGE IN THE GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEWS LANGUAGE IN POWERFUL WAYS SORT MID SENSIBLE IF YOU HAVE HANDS ON MATH AND STEM ACTIVITIES. WE'RE GOING TO TALK. IN FACILITATED TEACHER TALK. I THINK ALSO IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL JUST. THERE'S LOTS MORE THERE. BUT I THINK I'LL JUST MOVE TO THE NEXT NETWORK JUST BRIEFLY AND HIGHLIGHT. HIGH SCHOOL. TRANSITION FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL TO HIGH SCHOOL CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS OFTEN A PROBLEM IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE ABSENTEEISM RATE. AND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM MOVED FROM. BY TWENTY FOUR PERCENT DECREASED CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM DURING THAT TIME FRAME. AND CESAR CHAVEZ THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CHRONIC AS ANTI ISM FOR. ABS AFRICAN STUDENTS DROPPED FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM THE THIRTY THEIR POPULATION. WERE CHRONICALLY ABSENT DROP TO SIXTEEN PERCENT. OKAY UP FOR MALE ABSENTEEISM DROPPED TO EIGHT PERCENT EIGHTEEN PERCENT. THESE ARE BIG NUMBERS. SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES REALLY IMPORTANT. THEY'VE INCREASED ARE NOT ENOUGH WERE STILL IN THE BEGINNING BUT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE INCREASED YOU SEE IT ON THE CHART THERE. HERE'S SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT I WANTED TO JUST PUT A POST SECONDARY DEGREE EVERYONE HAS SAID IN THE LITERATURE COURSE AND THEN THE COMPANY SAYING WE NEED MORE POSTED POST SECONDARY EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. TENNYSON HIGHS. POST SECONDARY ACTIVITY IN A TEST OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. INCREASED BY EIGHTY NINE PERCENT SHOWBOAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN FIVE YEARS THAT'S A REMARKABLE FIGURE. THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD DO THIS. BUT CREATING THE SMOOTH TRANSITION PATHWAYS MAKE SHOW THEM IT'S POSSIBLE. AND I THINK I NEED TO CLOSE TO. I'M DONE THERE'S MORE GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT HEALTH EMPOWERMENT THIS IS A TO THE ONE PART PART ABOUT THIS IS A TO GENERATION APPROACH. YOU WE ARE JUST WORKING WITH THE KIDS ARE WORKING WITH THE FAMILIES AND YOU'LL SEE ON THAT LAST NETWORK THAT HOW MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR TECHNICAL EDUCATION THE PARENTS OF ALSO HAD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPEN FOR QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS. THAT TO NELSON SAYS ON GUNS WE CALL DROP IN THE MIKE. I COULD SEE ON YOUR FACE AND I'M GLAD. AND. IT'S A THANK YOU FOR THE LEVEL OF OWNERSHIP. NOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BEING THE PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER OF FOR THE HEREBY PROMISE UNLESS SOME OF HER TO DEAN. A SAY THAT KIND OF THING AND FOR TALKING ABOUT RESULTS BASS ACCOUNTABILITY HOW DO WE KNOW THAT ANYBODY IS BETTER OFF CAN WE PROVE IT. WILL HAVE QUESTIONS IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS AT THAT THANK YOU AND WE LOVE TO HEAR FROM OUR MISCONDUCT. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. I'M HERE TODAY TO COULD TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE NEEDS OF THE STATE RELATED TO. TEACHER DEVELOPMENT AND STUDENT LEARNING AND HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL MODELS A COLLABORATION THAT ARE. SUPPORTING STEM DEVELOPMENT AND OUR REGION AS YOUR PUPPY WHEREIN TWENTY THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA ADOPTED NEW SCIENCE STANDARDS NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS ARE FOUNDATIONAL. TO. TO ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO A ROBUST HIGH QUALITY SITES EDUCATION STARTING IN THE EARLY SERVE GRADES. THE GOAL OF THE STANDARDS IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE WELL INFORMED CITIZENS TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE AND CAREERS AND UNDERSTAND APPRECIATE THE SCIENTIFIC ENTERPRISE. THAT'S HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN THE CASE IN OUR SCIENCE STANDARDS AND THE PASTOR ST SCANNERS BEEN TAUGHT AS A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE FOR STUDENTS TO MASTER. AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE THAT MASTERY OF CONTENT BACK IN A WAY THAT'S BEEN PRESCRIBED IT WITH THE ONE ANSWER ONLY APPROACH. THE INJUSTICE CALLS FOR REFOCUSING QUE TWELVE SIGNS FOR IMPROVED COLLEGE PREPARATION STEM CAREER READINESS. AND ABILITY OF ALL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. TO ACCOMPLISH AS THE INJUSTICE FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING THE HABITANTS SKILLS THAT SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS USE IN THEIR DATED A LIFE. STUDENTS WILL SHIP FROM LEARNING ABOUT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND MAKING SENSE OF PHENOMENA AND LOCAL PROBLEMS. THIS DEEPER FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING AND APPLICATION REQUIRE NEW APPROACHES TO PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FOR TEACHERS AND A RECOGNITION THAT BECOMING AN EFFECTIVE SCIENCE TEACHER OR STEM TEACHER IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS THAT. STRETCHES FROM PRE SERVICE EXPERIENCES AN UNDERGRADUATE YEARS TO END OF A PROFESSIONAL CAREER. I LIKE HIGHLIGHTS SEVERAL KEY PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FEATURES THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO REALIZE. STEM QUA HIGH QUALITY STEM PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS. AND TEACHERS. ONE WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT. TEACHERS ARE GOING TO MAKES NEED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS IN THE WAY THAT CONTENT AND THE MATTER THAT THEY DELIVER CONTENT IN THEIR CLASSROOMS IF STUDENTS ARE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THESE TO. NEW SET OF STANDARDS. AND THAT SHIFT IT'S GOING TO HELP THEM REQUIRE THEM TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW THEY LEARN SCIENCE ESPECIALLY IN THEIR UNDERGRADUATE YEARS. TYPICALLY. WE NEED TO DESIGN PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. THAT ALLOW TEACHERS TO GRAPPLE WITH BOTH THE SCIENCE OR STEM CONTENT AS WELL AS TO THINK ABOUT HOW STUDENTS THINK AND LEARN ABOUT THE CONTENT AREA. WE NEED TO ALSO A PROFESSIONAL LEARNING THAT I INTRODUCES NEW INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES THAT'S GROUNDED IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT CONTENT WHETHER IT'S SCIENCE OR ENGINEERING AMOUNT. NOT HAVE THOSE AYE INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES BE DELIVERED IN ISOLATION IT'S REALLY HARD FOR TEACHERS TO MASTER THAT AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THAT MEAN AND THE CONTENT. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS. LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR TEACHERS TO BE CLOBBERED IN SUPPORT TEACHERS AND WORKING TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND APPLY AND REFLECT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. R. SCIENCE STANDARDS AS WELL AS OUR UP AND COMING NEW COMPUTER SCIENCE STANDARDS. WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE A ONE SIZE FITS DOZEN BURKE. TEACHERS ARE UNIQUE ON THE HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS AND TEACHERS IN ELEMENTARY MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL HAVE. VERY UNIQUE NEEDS. AS WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT PROFESSIONAL LEARNING IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE DESIGNED AS PART OF A COHERENT SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. AND FINALLY IN THINKING ABOUT. SINCE RECORDS TALK THAT EARLY MATH INITIATIVE AN EARLY SCIENCES I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO START IN THE EARLY SAID GRADES. AND OUR ELEMENTARY STUDENTS ARE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES OPPORTUNITIES FOR LITERACY DEVELOPMENT. THEN COMES ELT AND MOUTH. AND OCCASIONALLY SCIENCE AND A RECENT STUDY THAT WE DID ALAMEDA COUNTY WE SERVER DISTRICTS ANNUALLY. AND QUE TO TEACHERS ARE. ABLE TO PROVIDE ON AVERAGE THIRTY MINUTES OF SCIENCE INSTRUCTION WEEKLY IF IT'S OCCURRING AT ALL. AND UP TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES IF IT'S IN THE THREE THREE FIVE. WE SEE A HIGHER NUMBER MINUTES OF COURSE IN FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADE BECAUSE HISTORICALLY THAT'S WHAT OUR SCIENCE ASSESSMENT HAS TESTED. TEACHERS REPORT THAT THERE ARE NOT PERMITTED AT TIMES TO TEACH SCIENCE THAT THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE LITERACY. BUSINESS OUT OF SCIENCE STANDARDS ARGUE THAT WE DEVELOP LITERATE STUDENTS THROUGH THE CONTEXT OF SCIENCE MATH APPLICATION. AS CAROLYN MENTIONED ARE CAN ALSO MENTIONED THAT IS THE GREAT WAY FOR LITERACY TO DEVELOP. FOR OUR SCHOOLS BOTH THE NUMBER AND AGREE A CHANGES REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THESE NEW STANDARDS IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT. A CONSIDERABLE PREPARATION TIME IS NEEDED BEFORE AND AFTER FORMALLY ADOPTION FOR BOTH SIDES EDUCATOR IN SCHOOL LEADERS UNDERSTAND THE SHIPS TO PARTICIPATE IN PROFESSIONAL LEARNING. PILOT WORK CONTINUES SHE CHANGES MOST DISTRICTS RECOGNIZE THAT THEY NEED PARTNERS TO INITIATE AND SUSTAIN THIS WORK. MANY PROGRAMS AND STRUCTURES IN THE STATE STRUGGLE WITH INCONSISTENT FUNDING THOUGH. ON YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT OUR CALIFORNIA MATH SCIENCE PARTNERSHIP GRANT THAT REALLY FUNDED AND SUSTAINED A LOT OF WORK ACROSS THE STATE. OR NONEXISTENT THIS COMING YEAR AND SO THE EXPERTISE AND THE STRUCTURES THAT EXISTED THERE HAVE GONE AWAY AND DISTRICTS ARE LEFT GRAPPLING WITH THESE. THESE VERY COMPLEX SET OF NEW STANDARDS. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE MODEL THOUGH THAT'S BEEN SUPPORTING PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NEEDS US HAS A GREAT SUCCESS. AS MENTIONED EARLIER. I'M AT ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE SAID BUT I'M ALSO A CAL STATE EAST BAY IS ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA SCIENCE PROJECT DIRECTORS. AND IT'S SUCH A PRIVILEGE PLACE TO BE ABLE TO BE A PARTNER BETWEEN ON A UNIVERSITY IN A COUNTY OFFICE ADD AS WE GET. LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE OF OUR SCIENCE FACULTY ARE EDUCATION FACULTY AND THEN THE PRACTITIONER EXPERTISE THAT AND THE STEM. AT THE COUNTY OFFICE. WORKING COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE. FOR FUNDING AND. DESIGN AND DELIVER HIGH QUALITY. PROFESSIONAL LEARNING THROUGH GRANT. ONE OF OUR BIGGEST FUNDING. WAS INTERPRETED MIDDLE SCHOOL SCIENCE FOTOS AND US HAVE FUNDED WAS TARGETING STUDENTS AND TEACHERS THAT ARE OF HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM. AND ELEVEN OF OUR DISTRICTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. THE RESULTS FROM THAT. WORK I'VE BEEN PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL RECEIVED ON TEACHER AND STUDENT CONTENT GAINES AS MEASURED ON PRE AND POST. WE SEE THAT TEACHERS ARE UP TAKING NEW INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES AND STUDENTS ARE REPORTING. A GREATER. IDENTITY OF SCIENCE AND MORE EFFICACY. WE ALSO SEE A SHIFT IN AND AND FACULTY PRACTICES AS OUR FACULTIES ENGAGE IN THIS COMMITTEE OF PRACTICE WITH TEACHERS. AND WITH ON THE PETITIONS THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE THEY BEGIN TO THINK AND REFLECT ABOUT WHAT THEIR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS NEEDS IN ORDER TO LEARN. A NEW. GRANT. THAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO USE WE HUNDREDS SESSION FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL AND ELEMENTARY RECOGNIZING THAT THAT WAS THE GREATER NEED AND SO WE HAD CALIFORNIA MUST P. WHICH WAS FOCUSING ON TEACHERS IN GRADES THREE THROUGH FIVE. AND MEASURED BY THE EXTERNAL EVALUATION BECAUSE OF OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL WE HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST COURT OF CONTENT CANYON FOR TEACHERS AND NEW PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE. IN JUST TWO YEARS WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS PROFESSIONAL DEFAULT MODEL IS IS NOT JUST CONTENT DELIVERY FOR TEACHERS. IT'S CONTENT WITH NEW INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES THAT SUPPORT THE CONTENT. WITH INTENSIVE FOLLOW UP DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR WERE TEACHERS ENGAGE IN LESSON STUDY WHICH IS A CYCLE OF INQUIRY. AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT. WE BRING TOGETHER LEADERS AT THE DISTRICT INSIGHT LEVEL WITH THESE TEACHER LEADERS THINK ABOUT TRANSFORMATIONAL PRACTICES THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO MAKE DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY THAT SCIENCE HAS TALKED. ON. THERE'S ANOTHER. PROGRAM THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COUNTY OFFICE AND I'D LIKE TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT AND ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IS COMPATIBLE BUT MORE IN DETAIL. AND THAT'S THE ALIGNMENT BAY AREA THE ALIGNMENT VERY SICK CLOBBERED OF IMPACT INITIATIVE BRINGING TOGETHER LEADERS OF EDUCATION INDUSTRY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PORTS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT LEAD YOU THROUGH COLLEGE TO CAREERS TO INTEGRATE AND TRANSFORM SYSTEMS THIS MODEL BEGAN WITH THE CREW TRUST PATHWAY WORK. AND WAS EXPANDED WITH IBM INTERCEPT RANDOM WHICH OF THE INCLUDES GRANT. AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A HAND OUT YOUR PACKET AND THAT GRANTS ARE CALLED. RECESS OR REGIONAL COLLABORATION TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN STEM. THE LYMAN BAY AREA JOINS BOTH OF THESE EFFORTS TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE REGIONAL FOCUS THREE NETWORKS PARTNERSHIPS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. I POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE THIS IS AGAIN ANOTHER COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN A COUNTY OFFICE AND UCSF. AND A CALIFORNIA SCIENCE PROJECT SITE. BOTH OF THESE MODELS ANY POLICY IN FUNDING TO CONTINUE SUPPORT. EARLY ENTRANT ENTRY AND PIPELINE STEM CAREERS IN IMPORTS CITIZENS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CONNOR WHO KNEW THIS TURNED INTO A CAL STATE EAST BAY OUT PANEL. YOU KNOW CHINA I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER CAL STATE EAST BAY YOU WEAR A LOT OF HATS IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER STUFF. AND IT TENDS. Y. HELL LIVE YOU HAVE. A FULL DISCLOSURE OF PIN A LECTURER CAL STATE HE SPEAK ALSO WHO KNEW. THAT STEM A CALLOUSED EIGHTY SPAY WAS THE CONVERSATION THAT I POINT OUT ONE THING PLEASE AND CAL CD SPIN A WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IN THIS FIELD. BUT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES AND. FRANKLY I'VE JUST BEEN THERE FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF OR SO BUT I'VE BEEN SO AMAZED AT WHAT DOES GO ON IN TEACHING TEACHERS HOW TO TEACH. STAND TO HURT DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND SORT OF THE WHOLE GAMUT AND OUT OF SCHOOL TIME AND EVERYTHING. BUT THE CAL STATE SYSTEM IS. THE PRESIDENT AND I WENT TO A MEETING LAST YEAR THAT THE CHANCELLOR CALLED. STATEWIDE TO TALK ABOUT THIS WORK A LOT OF THE CSU CAMPUSES ARE DOING REALLY INNOVATIVE VALUABLE WORK IN THIS VERY FIELD. SO TO AND THEN. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS YOU KNOW SHORT CHANGING BUTTON EVERYBODY BUT. DIDN'T TAKE ANYWAY SUPPORTING RECOGNIZING THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM PARTICULARLY FURTHER VALUE IN TRAINING TEACHERS. WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATION IN ALL FIELDS BUT PARTICULARLY STEM. THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD JUST MAKE WHENEVER THEY WANTED TO. I THINK THAT'S AN ACCURATE IN RIGHTEOUS SHAMELESS PLUG UP AND RIGHT ON TIME THAT. IT'S TRUE. WE HAVE GREAT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING THAT NEED INVESTMENT. IN IN THE CSU SYSTEM. AYE IN THE UC SYSTEM AND I COMMITTEE COSTUMES ARE ALL FANTASTIC. ARE CLEARLY TODAY'S PANEL IS A A TESTAMENT TO CAL STATE EAST BAY AND WHAT THAT INVESTMENT HAS BEEN MEANT. AND I SURE HOPE THAT THE ENROLLMENT JUST SHOT UP IN THIS WAS A GREAT COMMERCIAL CAO YEAH. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ALL DO I'M I WANT YOU THE QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TERROR SAW CHAU SPEAKING OF CAL STATE EAST BAY. I'M JUST WONDERING. IF THERE IS ARE YOU UNDER REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN STEM AT THE ACCOUNTS THAT YOU SPACE. BECAUSE HISTORICALLY WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE REPRESENTED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE THEM WHAT'S UP STEAM AYE EDUCATION SO AND IF SO ARE WAY DOWN HOW DO WE RECTIFY THAT SITUATION. OF FOR FOR YOU FOLKS OUT YOU KNOW AND ALSO FORECASTING IN GENERAL AND AND ALSO THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I THINK YOU SHOULD. ALRIGHT WE'RE VERY DIVERSE WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT WOMEN IN IN THE UNIVERSITY AND WE HAVE GOOD REPRESENTATION IN THE SCIENCES WE ARE HIRING WOMEN INTO THE FIELDS WE. IN OUR PHYSICS DEPARTMENT THE LAST THREE HOW FOR HIRES THREE HAVE BEEN WOMEN TO MINORITIES AND SO WE'RE REALLY WORKING VERY HARD IN TERMS OF DIVERSIFYING OUR FACULTY. AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN REPRESENT. THE FACES OF OUR STUDENTS AS WELL AND THEN TO REALLY WORK TOWARDS THEIR GRADUATION AND SO WE'RE DOING A LOT OF EFFORTS IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. ENCOURAGE PEOPLE INTO THE FIELDS. SO WE'RE STARTING AT THE SCHOOLS RIGHT AND TEACHING THEM IN THROUGH. THE SCIENCE DAYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT BAYER AND OTHERS HAVE HELP TO SUPPORT WE ARE GETTING MORE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THE FIELDS AND LEARN EATEN THEM KNOWING ABOUT IT. SO IT'S REALLY BUILDING THAT PIPELINE IN THERE ONCE THEY'RE WITH US TRIED PROVIDE SERVICES SUCCEED. THANK YOU. LIQUIDATED CLAD ONES ONTO IT YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS TO LEARN THAT WE THINK BROADLY ABOUT IS HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE AN IDENTITY AS A SCIENCE CAPABLE PERSON. MULLIN TALK WITH EDUCATORS OFTEN WILL SEE THESE AMAZING STUDENTS BOTH MALE AND FEMALES THAT COME THERE ARE CLASS. RARELY DO WE RECOGNIZE AND SAY THAT YOU MAKE A GREAT EDUCATOR A SCIENCE EDUCATOR WILL SAY THAT YOU'LL MAKE A GREAT SCIENTISTS MIGHT MAKE A GREAT ENGINEER. I THINK THAT IS TEACHERS DEVELOPMENT THEIR IDENTITIES SPECIAL OUR ELEMENTARY WHICH HAS TEACHERS. AS THEIR IDENTITY IS SCIENCE CAPABLE AND THAT THEY CREATE ROBUST LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS AND THEN ME AND FEMALE STUDENTS IN THOSE GRADES FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG IN THOSE COURSES AND SUPPORTED. IN ENGAGING AND SINCE MAKING AND THAT THEIR IDEAS COUNT THEM WE WILL SEE MORE STUDENTS INTO READING COLLEGE PREPARED AND FEEL LIKE THAT'S A PLACE TO BELONG. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE CONVERSATION THAT WE STARTED WITH ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MATH AND EARLY LEARNING AND MATH LITERACY AND MISS OFFENDER WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT MATH FUN I HAVE TO ADMIT. I HAD FLASHBACKS TO SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH MY YOUNGEST THAT. I THINK GRUELING MIGHT BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT. AND THAT'S JUST ME A LOT OF CRYING. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO HER MATH PACKET CLOWN CAN THE YOU TALKED ABOUT MATH LITERACY. A KINDERGARTEN. IT INTO THAT MEAN BY. TIME THE STUDENT STARTS KINDERGARTEN OR BY THE TIME THEY'VE COMPLETED CAN THE GARDEN. AND WHAT COMPONENTS ARE REALLY ADVOCATING I KNOW THAT SO MUCH OF LITERATURE TALKS ABOUT. OR LITERACY IN GENERAL AND USING KINDERGARTEN IS A TIME TO REALLY SOCIALIZE STUDENTS TO SCHOOL AND NOT OVERWHELMING THEM. OR INTIMIDATING THEM WHAT ARE WE ASKING. OUR STUDENTS TO KNOW AND LEARN. BY KINDERGARTEN AS RELATES TO MATHEMATICS. BECAUSE SOME OF MY CONTENT EXPERTS TO BACK ME UP ON THIS. IT'S EASIER THAN I THOUGHT BEFORE I STARTED UNDERSTANDING THE STUFF I IT'S NOT. PRE ALGEBRA BY AGE THREE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEIR FUNDAMENTAL MATH YEAR INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTS THAT COME WITH MATH THINGS LIKE GROUPING. AND. PARA RANCIC'S EDUCATION WHO HAVE TIES SUBITO ICING. ANYBODY KNOW IT SUMA TYSON MEANS ZERO. YOU ARE. PLAYING A BOARD GAME. YOU LOOK AT. THAT DIETING ROLL FIGURE OUT HOW MANY SPEAKING. THAT ACTUALLY. DIE. THERE ARE. SO THERE SYMPATHETIC. KIDS CAN LEARN THROUGH EXPERIENCES. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THERE SIMPLY. HAVING A. THEY'RE NOT HAPPY BENEFITS COUNTING THEIR NOT HAVING EXPERIENCES PLAYING GAMES THEY'RE NOT HAVING USED. WITH OUR GROUP BEING AND HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES THAT ALLOW THEM TO. SO SAY POINTING OUT OF THE BLUE THINGS IN HER ROOM OR A LOT OF LITTLE KIDSTHEY CAN COUNT TO THREE. AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING HARD ABOUT FOUR AND HARD ABOUT GETTING INTO YOUR ARE THE TO YOUR OTHER HAND AND LEARNING SIX THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW VERY YOUNG AGES. SO IF PARENTS ARE KIND OF AWARE OF HIS STUFF IT'S VERY EASY TO DO AND THEN THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW THEN THEY CAN GROUP AND PATTERN AND DO ALL THAT STUFF. THAT BUILDS LATER WHEN THEY WHEN THEY GO AND SUMA TIES. SYMPATHIZING. IT'S GOING ON MY FACEBOOK RIGHT NOW. HOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE SYMPATHIZE? AFTER WAS INTERPRETED YEAH YEAH I UNDERSTOOD THAT WE COULD DO THAT BUT NO UNTIL I HEARD YOU DESCRIBE IT I'VE NEVER HEARD THE PHRASE. I GUESS MY QUESTION RELATES TO THE LAST THING THAT YOU SAID THAT PARENTS WHEN THEY KNOW. HOW DO WE PACKAGE THIS IN WAYS THAT PARENTS CAN SUE THE TIES WITH THEIR KIDS THAT THEY CAN DO GROUPING? IN WAYS THAT DON'T AN INTIMIDATE THEM OR CALL ON THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE. ALLEGEDLY YEAH. HOW DO WE HELP PARENTS TO DO THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY? I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT TODAY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SEND THAT WE'VE DONE A FLYER DATES IN THREE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ENCOURAGING PARENTS TO DO THAT. AND IT'S INTENDED IT HAS IT'S STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ALLIANCE AYE. IT'S TO BE DISTRIBUTED AT PEDIATRICS OFFICES AND PRESCHOOLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO SHOW HOW SIMPLE AND FIND IT CAN BE AND THEN TO LINK TO RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN GO ON AND YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A MORE. SIRIUS IS APPARENT BUT IT'S TOO AND IT'S TO. THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF THE PLAN THAT INVOLVES TEACHING. ADULTS NOT TO BE AFRAID OF MATH ME NOT TO RESPOND LIKE YOU AND I DO OWE MATH GRUELING. A WITH THEIR KIDS IT'S TO HIM IT IT IS FUN. WE'RE DOING THAT. I. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM CIRCLE ARABS AND IT'S CALLED MATH REALLY MATH GAMES AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR FACULTY AND BRUCE OF PUT TOGETHER. TO SHOW CARE GIVERS AS WELL AS LITTLE KIDS ARM THE FUN STUFF. AND I'LL JUST ADD ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PIECES OF. OF HELPING PARENTS SEE WHAT THEIR CAPACITY IS IS JUST TALKING TO THEM HAVING THEM TAKING THEM THROUGH SOME OF THESE MATH ACTIVITIES. PARENTAGE EDUCATION. IS AS IMPORTANT AS A CHILD'S EDUCATION YOU EDUCATE YOUR PARENTS TO EDUCATE YOUR CHILDREN AND PROVIDE IT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM SO WE OFFER ALMOST AS MUCH IN PARENTING EDUCATION. IN OUR PRESCHOOLS IN OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. ACTUALLY EVEN AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL WE HAVE A PATHWAY THAT INVOLVES PARENTS STARTING IN THE TENTH GRADE. WHERE AND STARTING TO BUILD A COLLEGE CULTURE WITH THEM BUT REALLY EARLY ON IN THE PRESCHOOLS? THIS PARENT EDUCATIONS ARE SUCH RICHARD PERTINENTES TO TAKE THEM THROUGH THE MATH GAMES. AND I DON'T THINK WHEN WE THINK OF EDUCATION WE DON'T TYPICALLY THINK OF PARENT EDUCATION WHO THINK OF IT AS ó THEY HAVE A DEGREE OR NOT ARE THEY GRADUATED MY SCORE NOT. ITS CONTINUAL. AND WHEN THE KIDS WHO THEIR PARENTS LEARN AND ENJOY IT. THEY ALSO THAT'S A MODEL FOR THE KIDS. IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF EMPOWERING THE PARENTS. IN IN THE HP AND ONE OF THE PROP PROGRAMS IS WORKING WITH THE PARENTS TO TEACH THEM AND THAT ADVISORY BOARD THAT CAROLYN TALKED ABOUT. IS A PARENT ADVISORY GROUP THAT COMES TO THE UNIVERSITY TO MEET PAY CHOSE TO MEET UP AT THE UNIVERSITY ON SATURDAYS CAROLINE MEETS WITH THEM. AND THEY WANT ONCE A MONTH AND THEY WANT TO P. THEY'VE TAKEN THE UNIVERSITY AS THEIR HOME. IT'S THEIR UNIVERSITY AND BUT IT IS EMPOWERING THEM TO KNOW THE QUESTIONS TO ASK IN THE THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO AND THEY EMBRACE IT. LIKE YOU WERE GONNA ASK OUR FRIENDS THE FIRST FIVE TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE CAMPAIGN YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT TALK READ SEEING THAT TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND HOW EARLY IT WE MUST EXPOSE KIDS EARLY. IS GOING TO BE TALK READ SEEING SUMA TIES YEAH AN AD THAT WE CAN AND THAT IS. WE'RE GONNA FIND ANOTHER WAY TO SAY SUMA TIES SO IT FITS INTO THE COMMERCIAL ON HOW TO TALK READ SAYING SUPERSIZED. COULD YOU SAY ONE LAST WORD ON THE AREA OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS IN THIS CONVERSATION COMES UP A LOT. FOR TEACHERS WHO DON'T HAVE AN IT BACKGROUND. HOW DO WE SUPPORT EDUCATORS ON TO BEING GAUGED AND PREPARING STUDENTS? FOR STAND FOR. BEING INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION EVEN WHEN THE EDUCATORS THEMSELVES ON HAVING IT BACK. SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. SO IT COMES ON THE SUMMATION OF COLLABORATION SO AT OUR COUNTY OFFICE LIKE MANY COUNTY OFFICES WE HUB INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE AN IT ENGINEERING AND MAKER SPACE. MENTALITY BACKGROUND AND TRAINING AND REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE BREAK DOWN THE SILOS OF EDUCATION WHERE. IT'S MATH PERIOD AT SCIENCE PERIOD ITS TECHNOLOGY TIME MORTON INSTEAD HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE UTILIZATION AND LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY. IN WAYS THAT HELP YOU MAKE SENSE OF THE SCIENCE THE MOUTH AND THE LITERACY. AND AND AND UP OF THE APPLICATION OF THAT TECHNOLOGY SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE PARTNERED WITH EXPERTS WHO. ARE TEACHERS WHO HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH OTHER TEACHERS THE POWER OF TEACHERS LEADERSHIP. AND TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN A WAY WHERE THEY COME IN AND THEY LEARN THROUGH APPLICATION HANDS ON. AND THE CREATE. SOMETHING THAT'S RELEVANT TO THEIR DATED A PRACTICE AS A TEACHER THAT THEY'RE GONNA TAKE BACK IN USE IN THE CLASSROOMS. IS ONE OF THE BEST APPROACHIS THAT WE HAVE FOUND BUT IT DOES REQUIRE US TO. MOVE AWAY FROM A SOLID APPROACH OF. CONTENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT AROUND. BUT WE HAVE I THINK A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS AND WHEN WE WERE PUZZLING OVER HOW DO YOU DRAW MORE FEMALES IN SCIENCE EARLIER ON. WE HAD SOME FACULTY OFFICE OR SCIENCE AND SCIENCE AT FACULTY WERE PUZZLING OVER THIS. AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK. TO GET SOME SOLAR SUITCASES IN OUR WATER PHYSICS PROFESSOR. WAS ABLE TO GET SOME FUNDING TO ORDER REAL SOLAR SUITCASES AND TEACH THE CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS. BY BUILDING THE SOLAR SUITCASES THEY DID THIS WITH A GROUP OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. MORE THAN HALF OF THEM WERE FEMALE. BECAUSE THE PURPOSE WASN'T LET'S LEARN PHYSICS LET'S LEARN SCIENCE THAT CAN BE APPLIED IN MEANINGFUL PURPOSEFUL WAYS. THE STUDENTS AND THAT'S THE KEY THEY FOUND NO WOMEN DROPPED OUT NO YOUNG WOMAN DROPPED OUT. THEY LOVED IT THEY THEN TOOK THE SOLAR SUITCASES TO SOME OF OUR PROMISE. TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS. BRAVE TRYING TO PILOTED AS AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AGAIN HALF THE CLASS WAS WOMEN WERE WITH HALF OF THE CLASS NINE YEAH MORE THAN ACTUALLY HAVE CLASS. THERE WAS AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM NOT ONE STUDENT FOR SIX WEEKS MISSED A CLASS BECAUSE THEY WERE BUILDING IN A HANDS ON WAY SOMETHING INTERESTING AND PURPOSEFUL. IS THERE SOLIS SUITCASES WERE GOING TO BE SHIPPED TO A COUNTRY WHERE THEY SAW PICTURES OF THE CHILDREN WHERE THAT WOULD BE USING THESE IN THEIR CLASSROOMS CROP OVERSEAS. SO THE FACULTY NOW HAVE BUILT THIS APPROACH INTO THEIR THEIR CURRICULUM. FOR IT NEXT YEAR AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL AND AGAIN TAKING A BACK. I THINK KEEPING THE INTEREST OF FEMALES. ARE OF GIRLS IN SCIENCE IT HAS TO BE HANDS ON PASTOR PROPOSAL AND I WOULD SAY IT NOT EVEN JUST FOR WOMEN FOR MEN TOO. FOR YOUNG MEN. THERE WAS A MIX OF NON SCIENCE MAJORS ALSO THAT ARE THE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY WASN'T ALL SCIENCE PAGE NEWS BUSINESS MAJORS IT WAS PEOPLE IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. TAKING THAT CLASS AND THINKING WELL I CAN DO THIS I CAN LEARN ABOUT SCIENCE AND I CAN EMPLOYER. BUT THE OTHER PART OF IT WAS THE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY COMPONENT OF IT. OF REALLY TALKING ABOUT THAT PART IN WHAT THE SOLICITOR EXTRA GONNA DO TO THESE PEOPLE IN COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE ELECTRICITY AND DON'T HAVE POWER AND DON'T HAVE LIGHTING. KEEP DO NOT SOLICIT CASES ARE. THANK YOU WE. WE WANT TO INVITE SOME OF OUR OTHER PANELISTS TO HAVE A WORD BUT IF YOU COULD WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU'D STAY. I'M WE DO HAVE SOME. COME A FEW AT A TIME A BILL TEN AND I SUSPECT THERE MAY BE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR ALL OF YOU. AGAIN AT LET'S THINK OUR FIRST PANEL. YEAH SURE. LOW ON. WELL OUR NEXT PANEL COMES FOR ALSO WHEN KNOWLEDGE. OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA A GREAT EDUCATOR HERSELF WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE. WE WELCOME TO. PRESENT. VINCE STUART. FROM THE CALIFORNIA STAND NETWORK. HE'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. DARIEN LOUIS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EAST BAY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ALLIANCE. A DOCTOR BERT LUBIN A THE DEAN OF PEDIATRIC HEALTH AT BENNY OFF CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. AND DOCTOR RENEE NAVARRO. UCSF EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR OF DIVERSITY AND OUT REACH. WELCOME AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION. WHENEVER YOU ARE READY WE'RE READY PERFECT. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN A MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY. SELECT COMMITTEE ON STEM EDUCATION. I'LL START BY SAYING I AM NOT FROM CS YOU EAST BAY BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE COLLEAGUES THERE. I AM THE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STEM NETWORK. AND I AM HERE TO PROVIDE A STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE ON SOME OF THE. ACTIVITIES INITIATIVES AND EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDERWAY. WITH RESPECT STEM EDUCATION AND WE WILL I'LL LIKELY PROCEED TO CHANGE OUR NAME FROM STEM TO STEAM. ALTHOUGH I KNOW DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE STATE OF THE A COULD BE ARTSY COULD BE AGRICULTURE SO. THAT MIA GENERATE LITTLE THE CONVERSATION BUT I'M SURE WE CAN WORK IT OUT. SO WITH RESPECT OF THE NETWORK. WE BRING TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS FROM TKD TWELVE HIGHER EDUCATION BUSINESS INDUSTRY GOVERNMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PHILANTHROPY. TO REALLY IDENTIFY SCALE AND SO STAINED EFFECTIVE STEM TEACHING AND LEARNING. HOW WE WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THIRTEEN AFFILIATED REGIONAL STEM NETWORKS ACROSS THE STATE THAT STRETCH FROM STRESS SHASTA COUNTY THE SAN DIEGO AND OF COURSE THAT INCLUDES US YES YOU EAST BAY? THROUGH POLICY ADVOCACY COMMUNICATIONS OUT REACH WE STRIVE TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO'VE BEEN UNDERSERVED AND UNDERREPRESENTED. IN STEM DISCIPLINES TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE HIGHEST QUALITY STEM EDUCATION POSSIBLE. COME I'D LIKE TO START WITH A FEW. IMPORTANT DATA POINTS. JUST TO FRAME MY COMMENTS. I THINK MOST FOLKS ARE AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF STEM OR STEAM TO OUR ECONOMY. SEVEN OF THE TEN FASTEST GROWING OCCUPATIONS IN STEM FIELDS. SEVEN OF THE TEN EXCUSE ME FASTEST GROWING OCCUPATIONS ARE IN STEM FIELDS. AND IN BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN STEM JOBS IN CALIFORNIA GREW BY NINETEEN PERCENT. AND I THINK THAT GROWTH IS CERTAINLY PROJECTED TO. AT LEAST MAINTAINED IF NOT INCREASE. NOW DESPITE THESE NUMBERS OUR SCHOOLS DON'T OFFER COURSES THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR STEM EDUCATION AND PREPARING FOR STEM CAREERS. SO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR SCHOOLS DON'T OFFER CALCULUS. FIFTEEN PERCENT DON'T OFFER PHYSICS AND TEN PERCENT DON'T OFFER CHEMISTRY. SO. IN ADDITION THOUGH TO THIS LIMITED ACCESS TO STEM COURSES WE ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS IN STEM EDUCATION. THAT ARE MOST. PRONOUNCED BY RACE AND ETHNICITY AND THIS TRANSLATES INTO MAJOR INEQUITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE SO THIS IS BASED ON THE NATIONAL. REPORT CARD SOME NAY DATA. BUT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF LATINO FOURTH GRADERS WERE PROFICIENT IN MATH. BY THE EIGHTH GRADE THOSE NUMBERS DROPPED TO FOURTEEN PERCENT AND THIRTEEN PERCENT RESPECTIVELY. THE NUMBERS FOR SCIENCE ARE EQUALLY TROUBLING. PROFICIENCY FOR OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO STUDENTS IN GRADES FOUR AND A REMAIN STATIC AT ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENT. SO WE SEE THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND INSTEAD OF MAKING PROGRESS AS CHILDREN PROGRESS THROUGH THEIR ORIGINAL EDUCATIONAL CAREERS WERE ACTUALLY MOVING. BUT THEY ARE BACKWARD OR WERE STAYING THE SAME. SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE NETWORK THE ISSUES OF ACCESS EQUITY AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN STEM EDUCATION HARI STATEWIDE CONCERN. AND ONE THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REQUIRES STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP. HAS A STATE CALIFORNIA MUST MAKE STEM EDUCATION A PRIORITY AND INVEST ACCORDINGLY. SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO. I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF EARLY MATH INSTRUCTION AND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE FOLKS AT FIRST FIVE I KNOW THAT I'VE RECENTLY SEEN SOME OF THEIR. NEW COMMERCIALS RUNNING WHERE IT IS BOTH TALK READ SING AND COUNT. WILL HAVE TO GET THEM TO MAYBE BROADEN THAT LITTLE BIT BUT I THINK THERE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. THAT THAT MATH LITERACY IN THE EARLY GRADES IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. WE CERTAINLY KNOW BASED ON BRAIN RESEARCH ECONOMIC ANALYSES THAT INVESTING IN OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN YIELDS THE MOST POSITIVE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM BENEFITS. EXPOSURE TO HIGH QUALITY ENGAGING MATH AND SCIENCE INSTRUCTION IN THE EARLY YEARS HELPS TO CREATE A MORE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH THE SUBJECTS. AND PROMOTE GREATER STUDENT INTEREST. TRINA HAD MENTIONED I THINK. THE. BENEFITS OF EARLY MATH SKILLS WE KNOW THAT COMPREHENSION. A OF DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE MATH SKILLS AND CONCEPTS IS ACTUALLY A STRONGER PREDICTOR OF LONGER TERM ACADEMIC SUCCESS EVEN MORE SO THAN LITERACY. I THINK THIS RESEARCH COMING OUT OF UC IRVINE. THAT REALLY SUBSTANTIATES THIS AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE. DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE. MATH AND SCIENCE CURRICULUM ALSO PROVIDES ENGLISH. LEARNERS WITH CONCRETE OPPORTUNITIES. PRACTICE REFINED THEIR SPEAKING LISTENING CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS. SO THE QUESTION ISN'T SO MUCH WHETHER KIDS ARE READY TO ENGAGE IN THE SUBJECTS HAVE AN EARLY AGE BUT RATHER OUR COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING THE NECESSARY ACCESS AND SUPPORTS FOR HIGH QUALITY STEM INSTRUCTION. THROUGHOUT T. K. BUT ESPECIALLY THE ELEMENTARY GRADES. AND THAT IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA THEM EDUCATION AND INCREASED SUPPORT FOR EDUCATORS IN STEM SUBJECTS. AS POLICY PRIORITIES. A RECENT REPORT I THINK THIS IS FROM THE. A NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOUND THAT AMONG ELEMENTARY EDUCATORS ONLY ABOUT A THIRD REPORTED HAVING COMPLETED AT LEAST ONE COURSE. IN THE STEM SUBJECTS OF LIFE. EARTH AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES DURING THEIR EDUCATION PROGRAMS. SO THIS IS WHY WE SUPPORT SOME VERY SPECIFIC STEPS THAT WE THINK WILL HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF TEACHER TRAINING THE TEACHER PIPELINE AND REALLY BUILDING OUT A MUCH MORE ROBUST. INFRASTRUCTURE TO SERVE MORE TO SUPPORT STEM TEACHING AND LEARNING. SO FIRST A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR STEM TEACHERS PRINCIPALS AND SCHOOL LEADERS IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES. WE NEED TO EXPAND THE PIPELINE OF NEW STEM TEACHERS BY FUNDING MORE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS I'M I THINK THIS IS A POINT THAT CAME UP EARLIER IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THE CSU CERTAINLY AT THE FOREFRONT WEEDS I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH FOLKS FROM CAMPUSES IN THE. CSU CHANCES OFFICE AS TO HOW WE CAN REALLY DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THOSE EFFORTS. WE NEED TO FUND INCENTIVES TO ATTRACT NEW AND RETAIN EXISTING TEACHERS TO MAKE THIS PROFESSION APPEALING AND TO COMPETE QUITE HONESTLY FOR THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST FOR BEING LURED AWAY. BY CAREERS IN IN TACK AND AND WE KNOW THAT THE DISPARITIES THERE IN TERMS OF OF THE ECONOMIC REWARDS BUT THERE ARE OTHER REWARDS. IN TERMS OF COMING INTO THE TEACHING PROFESSION THAT WE REALLY NEED TO TALK UP. WE NEED TO PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO STEM INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS IN RURAL SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS GREAT DISPARITY IN TERMS OF. THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS THAT INSTRUCTION IN THAT RANGES EVERYTHING FROM. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO THE ACCESS OF. AP COURSES AND A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS. WE WANNA SEE AN INCREASED FUNDING FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IN TERMS OF STEM PROFESSIONS WE KNOW THAT. THE GROWTH. WITHIN JOBS THAT REQUIRE COMPUTER SCIENCE TRAINING OR DEGREES. IS AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT IF NOT MORE OVER THE NEXT. SEVERAL YEARS. WE ALSO WANT TO SEE A STUDY OF THE AMOUNT OF INSTRUCTIONAL TIME IT'S BEING SPENT ON MATH AND SCIENCE. SO WE CAN WORK TO BALANCE THAT OUT SO THAT STUDENTS DO GET THE SKILLS THEY NEED FROM A VERY EARLY AGE WITHIN THEIR EDUCATIONAL CAREER. TO BECOME MORE PROFICIENT AND. DO WELL ACADEMICALLY AS THEY MOVE FORWARD. ALL OF THESE ITEMS ARE DRESSED. OR WILL BE ADDRESSED IN ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE EIGHTY SIX. BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN. THE CALIFORNIA STEM NETWORK IS PLEASED TO BE A SPONSOR OF THAT LEGISLATION WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE CAN I COUNT ON THE SUPPORT OF OF THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO MOVE THAT FORWARD. SO WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND JUST THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR THE TIME AND ATTENTION THIS MORNING. THANK YOU AND I'M GLAD WE GOT A BILL RIGHT. WE ARE ASKING FOR A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT. TO SUPPORT EXPANDING COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MORE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ARE AROUND STEM AND A FOCUS. ON RURAL. AREAS THAT HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS THANK YOU SO MUCH OBSERVE STUART I WENT OVER TO OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE DEMOCRAT SILVA FOR FEW REMARKS. GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY AND NINE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON THIS COMMITTEE. I DO HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND THEN A FEW QUESTIONS AND AS I CAME IN LATE I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR ALL OF THE PRESENTATION BUT THERE WERE A FEW THINGS THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME. I'VE BEEN A A. B. ELEMENTARY TEACHER FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AND I. I JUST WANNA SEE WHO'S IN THE AUDIENCE DO WE HAVE ANY PRINCIPLES OUT THERE. IN THE AUDIENCE. ANY TRUSTEES PART OF TRUSTEES. A ANY SUPERINTENDENTS. OKAY IT'S GOING THROUGH. SO FIRST EARNED IN AGAIN I'M JUST I'M I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO TAKE TOO MUCH TIME HERE BUT. IN THIRTY YEARS YOU SEE SWINGS FROM. WAY BACK IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN I STARTED TEACHING THAT WE DID MATH THEIR WAY I DON'T DOES ANYBODY REMEMBER MATH THEIR WAY. SO WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE MATH THEIR WAY WAS ACTUALLY EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THAT FOCUSED ON HANDS ON MATH. WHERE KIDS WERE COUNTING TOUCHING MEASURING ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE HUGE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT AND KIT SIN? AND ALL OF THESE THINGS TEACHERS SPEND THEIR WEEKENDS COLORING LITTLE. BEINGS MAKING FACES ON I'M COLLECTING THINGS ON THE WHOLE EMPHASIS WAS THINGS LIKE MAKING PATTERNS SO EVENTUALLY WHEN THEY GOT OLDER. THEN THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND SOME OF THESE. KIND OF PATTERNS YOU SEE AND HIGHER ED IN MATH AND. THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY BACK TO EVERYTHING WAS KIND OF PAPER PENCIL AND VERY RIGOR AND WE'RE NOT DOING THIS PLANE DEVELOPMENTAL STUFF AND THEN WE CUT IT. BACK THE OTHER WAY AND BY NOW WE'RE MOVING BACK THE OTHER WAY SO. WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THINGS LIKE TEACHER TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DIE IN A. AYE AYE I DO WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE TEACHERS BECAUSE EVEN SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT LIKE HOW MUCH TIME IS SOMEBODY REALLY SPENDING ON MATH OR SCIENCE IN THEIR CLASS. I WOULD ASK ALL OF YOU TO DO THE MATH EQUATION OF HOW MANY MINUTES ARE MANDATED FOR EACH SUBJECT AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT TEACHERS CAN DO EVERY SINGLE THING. THAT IS REQUIRED EVEN BY THE STATE FOR CURRICULUM WHETHER BP. UP P. E. HERE ARE ACTOR ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DONE AYE AND DO YOU KNOW A HUGE INVESTMENT AS YOU'RE SAYING. NOW THERE WAS A TIME WHEN TEACHERS DID QUITE A BIT OF THEMATIC TEACHING THAT ALLOW THEM TO MAYBE PULL IN SOME LITERATURE LITERACY AND THINGS THAT MIGHT MAYBE THEY WERE DOING MATH ALONG WITH THAT. BUT THE THE OVERALL ARCHING THING IS WE WANT THIS CURRICULUM YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD WE KNOW IT'S GOOD THE KIDS KNOW IT'S GOOD YOU SEE AN ENGAGEMENT YOU SEE A RESPONSE BUT THEN THE WHOLE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY. IS AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED ABOUT PRINCIPLES ADMINISTRATORS AND TRUSTEES THEY WANT HIGH TEST SCORES. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY THEY WANT ENRICHED CLASSROOMS AND THEY WANT EVERYBODY GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP BUT COLLABORATIVE THINKING AND ALL OF THESE THINGS. BOTTOM LINE IS THEY WANT. HIGH TEST SCORES AND THE WAY THE STATE TESTS KIDS AND ALL THE OTHER TESTING THAT DISTRICTS ARE PUTTING ON TEACHERS SO IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE TETE TESTY BUT IT'S ALSO INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS THAT PUT THEIR OWN TESTING ON. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CURRICULUM BOOKS THAT PUT TESTING ON. IN ORDER FOR THOSE KIDS TO DO WELL THIS STUFF GETS CUT OUT SOME OF THE DISCONNECT HOW YOU THAT WE CAN GO AROUND IN CIRCLES TALKING ABOUT THIS AND WE CAN TALK FOR WEEKS AND DAYS. BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THOSE CLASSROOMS AND YOU HAVE TO SEE ABOUT WHAT IS EXPECTED WITH THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND TO EVEN GET JUST IMAGINE THIRTY THIRD GRADERS. ON TO ALL KINDS OF COMPUTER STUFF AND FINING THE CHARGERS THAT WORK AND FINDING YOU KNOW WHO'S COMPUTER DOESN'T LOAD UP AND WHO DOESN'T KNOW THEIR NUMBER TO GET AND. THESE YOU HAVE TO BE IN THERE TO SEE THIS AND IT ISN'T THAT IT CAN'T HAPPEN BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE ALL THE OLD STUFF AND SAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL THIS NEW STUFF. AND THEN WHEN YOU TELL TEACHERS LET'S GET RID OF THE OLD STUFF AND START THE NEW STUFF. THEN WE'RE DOING MORE AND MORE IN TRAINING AND THEY NEVER REALLY GOT IT GET GOOD AT ANYTHING THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES. SO I YOU KNOW HAVE FOR MY OWN CHILDREN MY LAST WHEN THE GRADUATING FROM CAL STATE THIS THE MASTER. THEY CAME FROM ALL OF THOSE SWINGS YOU NOW FROM WHOLE LANGUAGE WHERE CHARTS WERE FALLING OFF THE CLASSROOM WALLS AND EVERYBODY'S READING LITERATURE IN GROUPS AND STUFF TO NOW WE'RE DOING THE WROTE. UP WITH WE'VE GOT A NEW PHONICS ONLY. AND THAT YOU KNOW BUT BECAUSE I WAS A TEACHER I READ TO THEM FROM THE TIME THEY WERE IN PRESCHOOL I HAD EARLY READERS IN KINDERGARTEN. BUT IT WAS LIKE THE FIRST FIVE WHERE WE READ WE SAYING WE GET BUT AGAIN. NOT EVERYBODY DOES THAT SO EVERYTHING IN HERE THE PIPELINE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANY OF IT BUT I GUESS AS THE PANELS GO ON AND I HEAR PEOPLE. JUST THAT SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO TAKE THE REALITY. WITH WHAT WE WANT. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET THERE I JUST WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME TEACHERS HERE BECAUSE IT ISN'T THAT THEY SHOULDN'T. I MEAN IN MY OPINION YOU SHOULD SPEND ALL DAY ONE DAY JUST DOING. PROJECT BASED LEARNING AND HAVE EVERYTHING OUT ON THE TABLES AND THEY'RE PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER IN THEIR FIXING THINGS AND THEN MAYBE A WHOLE NOTHER DAY WE'RE DOING ALL LITERATURE. BUT IF YOU GO INTO A CLASSROOM THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE STANDARDS UP AND NOW WE'RE DOING EMAIL DE AND NOW WE'RE GOING OUT P. E. SO. JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND HE KEEPS SMILING SO I KNOW HE KNOWS SOMETHING FFF. AFTER THE IT'S NOT TO BE NEGATIVE I LOVE EDUCATORS I LOVE ALL OF THE OPTIONS UP THERE BUT IT'S TO BE PRACTICAL. THANK YOU YEAH I THINK THAT. SIMILAR KRYSTLE OR ON POINTS OUT. THAT THERE ARE SOMETIMES PRACTICAL BARRIERS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE BEST RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE. YEAH AND I CAN'T FORGET THE CONVERSATION THAT SCENE I HAD ABOUT KIDS KEY BEING GIVEN TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS INCOMPLETE. BEING GIVEN GREAT COMPUTERS AND THERE'S NO MOUSE TO WORK WITH THE COMPUTER. OF THIS NO KEYBOARD TO THINGS THAT ARE MISSING. AND WE OFTEN DO HERE TEACHER SAY THAT IF THEY WERE TO IMPLEMENT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT COME DOWN FROM THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH HOURS IN THE DAY TO DO THAT AND SO AN ARMY JUST JUMP IN AND THE ONE THING THAT REALLY JUMPS OUT AT ME AS A STATE TESTING FOR THIRD GRADE. ART REQUIRES THAT THEY ACTUALLY WRITE AN ESSAY ON THE COMPUTER A THREE PARAGRAPH KIND OF WELL PUT TOGETHER ESSAY AT THIRD GRADE. MOST OF I WOULDN'T SAY ALL BUT A GOOD AMOUNT CAN DO THAT AND PAPER AND PENCIL IT'S STILL ROUGH BUT THEY CAN DO IT. BUT A GOOD MAJORITY CANNOT DO IT ON THE COMPUTER BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY TYPE OF KEYBOARDING. AND A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS AND THEY DO HAVE THE KEYBOARDS. FOR THE TEST BUT THEY SAVED THE KEYBOARDS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEM RUINED. BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE SAME STATE TEST YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE THOSE THINGS SO THEY DON'T GET THE PRACTICE NOW SOME OF THE FAMILIES WHO KNOW ABOUT THAT LET THEM GO ON LINE AND YOU KNOW WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THAT BUT AGAIN WE KNOW THERE. IS WHERE THE GREAT DIVIDE HAPPENS I AM THAT SHE MEANT GAP THERE WILL BE FAMILIES THAT WILL PUT HIM ON ONLINE AND AND YOU KNOW HELP THEM LEARN THAT. SO IT IT'S AGAIN THAT ASKING OR MAKING OR MANDATING AND THEN THE REALITY. SO I'M GONNA RECOMMEND WE DO TWO THINGS ONE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND IRE ARE GONNA WORK ON SOME THINGS LONG TERM WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND. OUT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT. ALL OF THESE GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS. THE STATE BOARD RECENTLY CAME UP WITH A GREAT. BLUEPRINT IN ANOTHER AREA HOW TO IMPLEMENT. NEW BEST PRACTICES AROUND BILINGUAL EDUCATION. I THINK WE NEED A SIMILAR ROAD MAP FOR MANY TOPICS INCLUDING UP WHAT WE DO AROUND STEM. SO THAT WE SO THAT WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND PROVIDE THESE GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS IN WAYS THAT ACTUALLY. CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR STUDENTS AND SO. THAT'S A LONG TERM WORK THAT'S A LONG TERM HOME ASSIGNMENT I'M EXCITED TO WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SUNDAY GONNA BE KEEPIN IT REAL. AND BRINGING SOME PRACTICAL INSIGHTS. FROM WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM TO HELP US REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO GET AWAY OF ACTUALLY MAKING THESE THINGS HAPPEN. I'LL ASK EACH PANELIST IF YOU HAVE A FOUGHT TO A CORPORATE THAT IN YOUR PRESENTATION. IF NOT WE'LL SAVE IT FOR THE QUEUE IN A. AND SO. SO THAT WE GET TO THE PANELISTS. MRS STUART VIA IF YOU WANNA JUST A MINUTE TO ADDRESS US SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE DO THAT WHILE WE DO THAT AND THEN WE'LL MOVE THROUGH THE REST OF THE CAMP. CERTAINLY AND AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THURMAN SO I THINK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA RAISES SOME VERY VERY GOOD POINTS. I DON'T THINK AT LEAST IN MY MIND THAT THIS IS AN EITHER OR PROPOSITION I THINK BOB CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS TKD EIGHT. I THINK IT IS REALLY MORE ABOUT HOW DO WE INTEGRATE OF MATH AND SCIENCE AND STEM. WITH IN E. LA AND AND AND MATH QUITE HONESTLY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TESTING. SO IT'S IT'S IT'S THAT INTEGRATION AND A HOLISTIC APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO ADDING ON. I ALSO THINK THAT THERE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUT OF SCHOOL TIME MANY OF OUR REGIONAL NETWORKS ARE REALLY LEVERAGING WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT OF SCHOOL. AND AND AND WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS CONNECTED STRONGLY TO WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING THE SCHOOL DAY SO THERE'S SOME SOME STRONG LINKAGE THERE. AND THEN THERE ALSO INFORMAL OPPORTUNITIES AROUND STEM THAT I THINK COULD BE LEVERAGED. GREAT INTEREST AROUND MAKER SPACES SO I THINK IT IS REALLY ABOUT HOW DO WE CONNECT THE DOTS. THE MANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US TO TOUCH PARENTS FAMILIES AND AND AND STUDENTS. SO THAT THEY GET A MUCH. BETTER EDUCATION THERE'S GREATER EXPOSURE AND THEY ACTUALLY GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IN TERMS OF THEIR UP PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVEMENT SO I% APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL TIME TO RESPOND. OUT THANK YOU KNOW I THINK YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT WE DISCUSSED IT BRIEFLY EARLIER IN THE FIRST PANEL IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATING. YOU KNOW SITE CONCEPTS IN IN OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CURRICULUM AND I AGREE IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR. PROPOSITION AND. TO YOUR POINT ABOUT TOM HOW WE USE A NIGHT CLASS TIME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND I ARE GOING FORWARD A BILL THAT WOULD FOCUS ON HOW WE PROVIDE MORE STEM SUPPORT DURING THE AFTER SCHOOL HOURS IT SPONSORED BY. ON TECHNET AND THEIR MANY THERE WHO BELIEVE THAT I'M SOME OF THE BEST WORK AROUND STEM. HAPPENS DURING THE AFTER SCHOOL pWE THINK THAT THERE'S A. LOT LESS USED A WHOLE DAY THE WHOLE SCHOOL DAY ON TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. AREN'T WELCOME YOU MISS LOUIS HERE YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU AND I THINK SOME OF MY COMMENTS WERE ACTUALLY ADDRESSED TO THE ROLE OF BUSINESS. AND HOW THE COMPLIMENT. THE PROMOTION OF STEM OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL DAY SIDE FIRST LIKE TO THANK CHAIRMAN TONY THURMOND AND SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF STEM AS IT RELATES TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. MY ORGANIZATION IS THE EAST BAY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ALLIANCE WHERE EAST BAY EDA. WHERE CROSS SECTOR HIGH LEVEL LEADERSHIP GROUP DEDICATED TO BUILDING ECONOMIC DICK WEALTH AND PRESERVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE EAST BAY WE UTILIZE CROSS SECTOR LEADERSHIP? REGIONAL MARKETING RESEARCH ADVOCACY AND BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. TEN YEARS AGO CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES CONVENED EDUCATION AND BUSINESS LEADERS IN AND INNOVATION AND ONE POINT OVER RUPE. TO DISCUSS WAYS THE UNITED STATES COULD REMAIN GLOBE. AND THIS RESULTED IN TWENTY ONE PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT SENATE ON TEACHER PREPARATION CURRICULUM AND THE DELIVERY OF EDUCATION LAW. IN FEBRUARY TWENTY SIX TEAM DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LAST TERM IN OFFICE HE AND LEADER PELOSI AFTER UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. FOLLOW UP WITHIN INNOVATION TWO POINT OH CONVENING TO REEXAMINE THE NATION'S GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS IN LIGHT OF HOW TECHNOLOGY HAD CHANGED THE WORLD. OUR UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE EAST BAY CONGRESSWOMAN LEGAL CONGRESSMAN SWALWELL CONGRESSMAN TO SONG A INVITED REGIONAL LEADERS TO RESTART THE DIALOGUE IN APRIL OF THAT YEAR. SEVERAL OF THE ATTENDEES OF THE INNOVATION TWO POINT OH MEETINGS REQUESTED THAT A PLAN OF ACTION BE DEVELOPED TO ENGAGE BUSINESS AND EDUCATION TO PROMOTE STEM EDUCATION. MY ORGANIZATION WAS ASKED TO RECONVENE THE GROUP IN OCTOBER OF THAT YEAR TO SOLICIT MORE DETAILED INPUT ON LONG AND SHORT TERM ACTION ITEMS. ALL OUR EMPLOYER ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS TASKED WITH DOCUMENTING THE DISCUSSION INTO A FORMAL REGIONAL STEM ACTION PLAN. THAT BUSINESS GOVERNMENT EDUCATORS AND THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY COULD EMBRACE. OUR EMPLOYER ADVISORY COMMITTEE CO CHAIR TRINA OSTRANDER IN FROM FROM HOW CAN A CAL STATE EAST BAY. AND ALSO THE HEAD OF THE INSTITUTE FOR STEM EDUCATION. IS HERE TODAY AND SHE WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN THE PROCESS AND BY THE WAY SHE WILL BE INDUCTED INTO THE ALAMEDA COUNTY WOMEN'S HALL OF FAME IN TWO WEEKS. SO THIS DISCUSSION IN THIS WORK FROM COMMITTEE CULMINATED INTO A FORMAL INNOVATION TO POINT ONLY SHALL STEM ACTION PLAN. WHICH I'VE BROUGHT OUT COPIES FOR ALL OF YOU TODAY AND IS ALSO VISIBLE ON OUR WEBSITE WE ROLLED HIS PLANNED OUT IN ME. WITH OUR CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS WHO THEN BROUGHT THE PLAN BACK TO WASHINGTON DC TO SHARE WITH THE COLLEAGUES. THIS WAS THE NATION'S VERY FIRST UPDATE TO THE ORIGINAL INNOVATION A ONE POINT OH PLAN AND WE'RE VERY PROUD AND HONORED TO HAVE A KEY ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT. THE NEED FOR THIS PLAN TODAY IS GREATER THAN EVER. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE NESS AND FEELS THAT REQUIRES STEM SKILLS. OUR BUSINESS LEADERS NEED ACCESS TO HOME GROWN TALENT. TO MAKE TODAY MANY OF OUR JOBS HERE AT HOME OR OUT SOURCED THROUGH H. ONE B. VISAS OR COMPANIES ARE FINDING THEMSELVES HIRING TALENT WHO LIVE FARTHER AWAY FROM OUR JOB CENTERS. AND THAT CONTRIBUTES TO TRAFFIC CONGESTION POOR AIR QUALITY AND A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. AND THIS IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE WAY TO CAPTURE A SKILLED WORKFORCE. EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS THEY CAN BE ENGAGED IN THE EDUCATION OF STUDENTS TO PROMOTE THEIR ADOPTION OF STEM SKILLS AND STEM RELATED CAREERS. EMPLOYERS KNOW THAT EVEN WHEN THEY SHARE THEIR TRAINING NEEDS WITH EDUCATORS. SKILL REQUIREMENTS CAN CHANGE FREQUENTLY WITH TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FASTER THAN A CURRICULUM CAN BE DEVELOPED TEACHERS CAN BE PREPARED AND CAN EVEN ASSEMBLED STUDENTS TO COME IN THE CLASSROOM. PARA PLAYERS OPEN THEIR DOORS TO YOUTH FAMILIES AND TEACHERS ON NATIONAL MANUFACTURING DAY TO DEMYSTIFY WHAT FACTORIES LOOK LIKE A SHOW HOW ROBOTICS AND TECHNOLOGY ARE KEY. TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. BUSINESS VOLUNTEERS MEET WITH YOUTH ON STEM CAREER AWARENESS DAYS TO DISCUSS WHAT THEY STUDIED WHEN THEY WENT TO SCHOOL WHAT KIND OF JOBS THEY HOLD AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WITH THE EARNED. THE SHOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF JOBS ACROSS INDUSTRIES THAT NOW REQUIRES STEM SKILLS AND THESE AREN'T JUST JOBS IN LABS THEIR CAR DEALERSHIPS BAKERIES. CONSTRUCTIONS FIGHTS AND FOOD PROCESSING COMPANIES. I WOULD THE VERY VERY YOUNG PRE KINDERGARTEN AGE CHILDREN BUSINESS VOLUNTEERS CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS AND MATH PUZZLES AT LOCAL CHILDREN VENUES LIKE OUR ANNUAL FAIRYLAND DAY. AND COMMUNITY LAPSED MANY WHICH ARE FUNDED ACTUALLY BY BUSINESS. ALL OF THESE ARE TO ACT ALL THESE ACTIVITIES ARE REPLICABLE SCALABLE AND IMPACTFUL AND WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES CAN REACH MORE YOUTH WHO NEED THIS DAMN ORIENTATION AND MOTIVATION. AND THE LONG TERM GOAL OF ALL THIS BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT IS TO ADDRESS THE AFOREMENTIONED CONCERN OF DEVELOPING A LOCAL. TALENTED AND DIVERSE WORKFORCE READY TO HIRE. YOU WILL SEE MANY EMPLOYER LET STRATEGIES IN THE INNOVATION TO PLANO REGIONAL STEM ACTION PLAN BECAUSE BUSINESSES REALIZE STEM APTITUDE IS NOT A LUXURY. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO BUSINESS SUCCESS EMPLOYEES SAID SUSTAINABILITY CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND YES GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO WHERE WE LOOK FOR TALKING WITH YOU MORE ABOUT THE COMPANY SAID SUPER YOUR EFFORTS AND SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS. AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME OUR THIS YEAR TO FAIRYLAND DATE WAS A GREAT EVENT THANK YOU. I'LL DOT TO LIVE AND WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY. OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR REMARKS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. I'VE I'M AB MAYBE UNIQUE PERSON IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE I'M THE ONLYPEDIATRICIAN. AND ARE PROBABLY THE OLDEST PERSON IN THIS ROOM BUT I'VE BEEN A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN OAKLAND FOR FIFTY YEARS. AND I STARTED HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY THAN I'VE DIRECTED TO RESEARCH PROGRAM AND NOW ON THE ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTHY UCSF. I AM MY COMMITMENT IS TO SOCIAL JUSTICE IN EQUITY AND I AM SO PLEASED AND PROUD TO HEAR ALL THE PRESENTATIONS THAT OCCURRED TODAY. ANDTHE COMMITMENT OF THIS COMMITTEE TO REALLY ADDRESSING A MAJOR MAJOR PROBLEM. BUT I THINK. TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK OF ALL THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH EDUCATION IS HEALTH. BUT WHEN A FAMILY HAS NO ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD WHEN THERE'S NO FOOD ON THE TABLE. WHEN THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR EDUCATION AT ALL AND WITH THERE'S SO MUCH STRESS PLACED ON. I HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS WE'VE HEARD TODAY WHICH ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS EQUITY. THOSE KIDS THAT ARE THE MOST STRESSED ARE GOING TO BE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THIS SO I THINK IS WE THINK OF OUR PLAN. OF HOW WE IMPLEMENT THIS WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. THE KIDS THAT ARE MARGINALIZED IN OUR SOCIETY AND THAT THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND BROUGHT INTO THIS. DECADES AGO WITH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDED SOMETHING CALLED SCIENCE EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS SEPA AND WE HAD ONE IN OAKLAND. AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TEACHER'S ROLE I REMEMBER ARE MAJOR ISSUES TEACHERS SAID THEY LOVE THIS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY TIME IN THE DAY. AND WHEN CAN WE DO THIS AND WAS THERE A COMMITMENT FROM FROM THE HIGHER REPS TO REALLY PRIMITIVISTS SO WE WENT TO AFTER SCHOOL AND WE ALSO SHOWED THAT. PARENTS NEED TO BE PART OF THE WHOLE PROCESS. AND WHEN I CAME IN TODAY I SAW THESE ALL THESE YOUNG CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND DOWNSTAIRS WHERE AND I THOUGHT. THERE ARE PROBABLY NOBEL LAUREATES IN THAT GROUP THEY ARE NEVER GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN TO REALLY DEVELOP TO WHAT THEY CAN. AND IN THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE HAD AS PILOT PROJECTS A CHILDREN'S IN OAKLAND WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE QUALITY OF THOSE CHILDREN. AND MANY OF THE TEENAGERS ESPECIALLY. IF YOU TRY TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM. THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO WORK HARDEST ARE THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING HARD TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. SO WE HAVE TO REALIZE IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER PROGRAM WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO FOR THEIR OVERALL TO KEEP THEIR FAMILIES TOGETHER AND I THINK IS WE THINK OF THESE NEW EDUCATIONAL THINGS. THERE HAVE TO BE SOME RESOURCES TO DO IT SO WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT AT OUR RESEARCH INSTITUTE IT'S FUNDED BY THE AND I H. IT'S FINE ADVICE ARM. CALIFORNIANS INTO FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE SURROUNDED BY DORIS DUKE IT'S ALL WRITTEN UP IN THE MATERIALS THAT YOU HAVE BUT IT HAS A STIPEND. AND AS FOR UNDERSERVED STUDENTS AND IF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE STIPEND THEY COULDN'T TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY. I'M BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES THESE ARE THE KIDS THAT THAT THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO. SAY THERE'S ANOTHER CAREER AND IT'S AMAZING. I CAPABILITIES THEY HAVE AND THEIR HOPE AT THE END OF DECEMBER THAT THEY COULD DO SOMETHING MORE THAN THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD DO BEFORE. AND I THINK OF ALL THE PRESENTATIONS I HEARD TODAY WHICH WERE WONDERFUL HOPE IS ALL PART OF IT. HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER AND I'M I'M REALLY PROUD OF THAT ANOTHER PROGRAM WE HAVE IS IT'S CALLED THE CHAMPS PROGRAM WHERE WE WORK WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND GIVE A OPPORTUNITY THESE ARE ALL THAT I THINK ATTACHED IN YOUR BROCHURE OUT FOR STUDENTS TO GET CREDIT WORKING AT THE HOSPITAL. EYES DOING. MEDICAL THINGS THINKING ABOUT CAREERS IN MEDICINE SO WE HAVE A SCIENCE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE A CAREER PROGRAM. BUT I THINK IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THEIR MANY WONDERFUL ONES THEY ALL DO THIS. AND THEY CALL THEM A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT EVERYBODY HAS A PROGRAM ALL THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE PROGRAMS. AND IN THE HEALTH SYSTEMS AND ALL THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS WE NEED TO COORDINATE THAT TOGETHER I HEARD SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS TODAY. THAT IF WE CAN NETWORK THIS WITH YOUR BILL. WE COULD REALLY MAKE THIS STATE THE LEADER IN THE WORLD AND I I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH. AND I AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO WITH THE TERM YOU USED WHICH. DOCTOR NEVER ARE AND I ARE FACED WITH EVERY DAY IS BEST PRACTICE. WHAT IS THE BEST PRACTICE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AND I THINK WE CAN DO THIS HERE AND I THINK IF YOU TAKE? ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS STATE AND WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING WE HAVE A REALLY REALLY WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. AND WE NEED TO REALLY ADDRESS MORE THAN JUST EDUCATIONAL GAP IF WE WON EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT COULD OCCUR IF WE DON'T LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HOUSING FOOD A JOB OPPORTUNITIES I GAVE. THE A I'M NOT PATTING MYSELF HER BETTER HAVE A COUPLE YEARS AGO I WAS FORTUNATE TO GET A TED TALK ON POVERTY IS A DISEASE OF CHILDREN. AND IT IT SIDE YOU TO BET IT'S BETTER BETTER REALLY TALKS ABOUT EDUCATION FITTING AND IF YOU DON'T ADDRESS THE POVERTY CHALLENGE. THEN HOW YOU COULD EDUCATE SPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS EQUITY SO THE KIDS THAT HAVE COMPUTERS WITH MASSES AT HOME THEY HAVE MONEY. AND THEY HAVE THOSE RESOURCES FOR THEIR FAMILIES THOSE THAT DON'T DOWN. AND LASTLY AND THERE'S A ORGANIZATION CALL YOU S. SPIRE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE BUT THIS IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. THAT HELPS KIDS APPLY TO COLLEGE DOES THE PAPERWORK HELPS BECAUSE MANY FAMILIES ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT TO DO IN THE KIDS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND. NEXT WEEK I'M GIVIN AND GET A RECEIVE THE HONORARY AWARD FOR THIS COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ASPIRE FOR KIDS. SOUND. SO AS A PEDIATRICIAN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GOOD YOU DO BECAUSE THE FUTURE OF OUR SOCIETY IS IN THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU. DO NO NORMALLY WE KNOW WE'RE TOLD NOT TO ALLOW ON THE APPLAUSE IN THIS CHECK. YOU KNOW WE DON'T FALL RULES ARE GOOD FOR KIDS GOOD PEOPLE AND. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN THE CHAMBER TODAY WHO WHO DESERVE THE RECOGNITION AND DOCTOR LUBIN AND INTRIGUE OSTRANDER FOR YOUR RECOGNITION SOME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. I'M. UP FIRST I HOPE THAT MISTER STEWART DOESN'T THINK I WASN'T BEING POSITIVE ABOUT I I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE. LIKE COMBINE. PRACTICAL AND REALITY WITH NEW INNOVATION AND EXCITEMENT. A AND I DO THINK IT DOES AS THE DOCTOR LEVINE SAYS YOU KNOW KIDS HAVE TO HAVE HOPE AND IT REALLY STARTS WITH THE VERY BASICS. WHEN I STARTED TEACHING AT TWENTY. ONE OR TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD I. I ACTUALLY TAUGHT IN PHILLY TEN AT WHAT WE'D CALL HILL SCHOOL IN FULLERTON ACTUALLY HAS HILLS AND AND SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE UPPER. TYPE OF SCHOOL WITH THE. OF THE LOT OF FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN AT THAT SCHOOL THERE WASN'T ANY ISSUES AT ALL BUT IT DEFINITELY WOULD MOST OF THE MOMS AT THAT TIME. YOU KNOW IN THE EIGHTIES WERE STAYING HOME AND SO HOLD DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT. AND THEN I CHOSE TO TO MOVE TO THE SCHOOL I ACTUALLY ATTENDED IN FULLERTON A WHICH IS A TITLE ONE SCHOOL AND SPENT MOST OF MY UP YEARS TEACHING THERE. AND WHEN I FIRST STARTED TEACHING MY WHOLE KIND OF PASSION FOR TEACHING WAS ABOUT CREATIVITY IT WAS ABOUT. THINGS THAT I LIKE TO DO WHETHER IT BE OUR TOUR LIKE I SAID VIETNAM. BIG CINEMATIC THINGS ON LITERATURE RAN AND WRITING AND AND YOU KNOW AND AND MAYBE I WEAVER DURING THE MASS OUR WAY SO YOU KNOW I REALLY ENJOYED THAT TOO. BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON IN EDUCATION WE DIDN'T HAVE DISCUSSIONS THIRTY YEARS AGO ABOUT ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WHEN I MOVE BACK TO THE SCHOOL THAT I HAD ACTUALLY GONE TO. OF COURSE IT WAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT. ISSUE AND EVEN THOUGH THOSE. IT DEMOCRATS AS WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY THAT IF A KID OR A STUDENT HAS AN ABSCESS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD DENTAL CARE. OR LIKE YOU SAY THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE SLEEPING. ARM AT NIGHT LOW'S ARE ALL THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THEIR DAY BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO THE CURRICULUM. BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO THE BEST PRACTICES. AND WAY BACK TWENTY YEARS AGO SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THERE WAS A GRANT. THROUGH THE STATE CALLED HEALTHY START AND THIS THIS GRANT WAS REALLY. FORM TO MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH IN YOUR DISTRICT SO WHAT WHETHER IT BE BUSINESS. OR OTHER CONNECTIONS THAT DIDN'T START A NEW PROGRAM THAT BUT YOU WOULD BE A LIAISON IN YOUR COMMUNITY TO GO OUT. AND MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS SO ONE CONNECTION WE MADE IN IN FULLERTON WAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL OF OPTOMETRY WAS RIGHT THERE. SO WE WERE ABLE TO CONNECT THEM TO DO EYEGLASS EXAMS AND SO SURE ENOUGH WHAT DID WE FIND OUT THAT A LOT OF OUR FIRST GRADERS NEEDED GLASSES AND WORK. SO IT WAS KIND OF GOING BACKWARDS IN DOING SOME OF THE HOLISTIC ISSUES OUT WE WEE ABLE TO BUILD A HEALTH CLINIC RIGHT BEHIND OUR SKILL SCHOOL BECAUSE THEN I WENT ON CITY COUNCIL ON I REALIZED HEY. WE CAN GET THINGS DONE WE PUT LIGHTING AND SO THAT THE KIDS COULD DO SOCCER AFTER SCHOOL THAT THE CITY PAID AND IT WAS A PARTNERSHIP. BUT IT WHAT REMAINS IS SOME PEOPLE THINK HOLISTICALLY OR. I'M I'M DEATHLY KIND LIKE A HOLISTIC KIND OF PERSON AND THEN OTHERS BECAUSE OF THE TRAINING OR BECAUSE OF WHATEVER THEY SEE THEIR LANDS THROUGH MIGHT SAY THAT'S NOT MY JOB. THAT'S A SOCIAL THING WE DON'T DO SOCIAL THINGS WE DON'T HAVE COUNSELORS ON SCHOOLS WE DON'T. IT ISN'T OUR JOB TO ASK THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS AND LATER EVEN ALLOW UP TO THE LAST FEW YEARS OF TEACHING WHICH IT WAS ONLY FOR ME IS. LESS THAN IT ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. ONE I'D HAVE STUDENT PARENT CONFERENCES IT WOULD ALWAYS USED TO BE YOU WOULD TELL THEM HOW THEY WERE DOING IN SCHOOL. AND THEN IT BECAME THIS WHOLE THING OF JUST GIVEN THE SCORES AND ALL THIS STUFF. BUT MY LAST FEW YEARS I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS I TOOK OUT A NOTEBOOK AND ASKED THEM. WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE OVER AN OVER THE PARTICULARLY IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THINGS JUST? DECLINED WE HAD KIDS WHO ARE HOMELESS WE HAD PARENTS WHO WEREN'T GETTING HEALTH CARE WE HAD A DREAMER KIDS WHO WERE OLDER STUDENTS OF MINE NOW TRYING TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I WOULD JUST WRITE THIS LIST. AND BECAUSE I HAD BEEN THE HEALTHY START COMPORTED NADER AS A TEACHER I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT ON SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT. I CAN THEN MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS AND ONCE YOU MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS LIVES DO CHANGE BECAUSE AND THEN THEY'RE FREED UP FROM ALL THIS ANXIETY OF A ONE IN TROUBLE. BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY UNIFORM OR I'M BEING PUNISHED BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO MY HOMEWORK AND I'M SITTING AT THE WALL AND I. CAN'T PLAY RICK GO TO RECESS OR I DON'T GO ON THE FIELD TRIPS NOW SOME OF THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN RECTIFIED WITH THE LEGISLATION. NOW TEACHERS CAN'T KEEP KIDS FROM GOING ON FIELD TRIPS BECAUSE TYPICALLY THOSE ARE THE KIDS WHO NEED TO GO ON THE FIELD TRIPS. SO I THINK THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. SPECIFIC CURRICULUM LIKE STEM I'M A HUGE SUPPORTER BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW IS KIDS ARE DOING THINGS I MEAN WHEN THE PASSIVE IN A GROUP WHETHER IT'S LOOKING AT A COMPUTER SCREEN AND AGAIN NOW MORE AND MORE AS COMPUTER LEARNING WE GOT SCREENS IN FRONT OF US. A LOT OF TIMES THE CLASSROOMS ARE DARKENED BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A SCREEN THERE AND THE KIDS BECOME A VERY PASSIVE AUDIENCE OF THE WHOLE POWER POINT THINGS. I MEAN AND HOW MANY OF US ARE YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE TEN SLIDES NOT FIFTY BUT THE POINT IS THAT THEY'RE NOT ACTIVE THEY'RE NOT MOVING AROUND SO. I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN STEM BUT AGAIN AS WE HAVE ALL OF YOU WHO ARE OUR VOICES ON THE COMMUNITY. THE FIRST THING THAT THEY CARE ABOUT. KIDS CARE ABOUT IS IF THEY'RE HUNGRY. THE JUST NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEARN AND WE CANNOT FORGET THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU I HAD BOXES OF GRANOLA BARS IN MY. DESK AND. I'M NOT TRYING TO PAINT THE WORST SCENARIO AND BE THE BLEEDING HEART I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU. THESE ARE HILL SCHOOLS IN FULLERTON BECAUSE I WENT BACK TO THE HILL SCHOOL AT THAT TOWARDS THE END. BUT. CURRICULUM MATTERS AND IT'S ESSENTIAL IN ENGAGEMENT IS HUGE BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COMBINING NAM WITH THOSE HOLISTIC THINGS THAT WE KNOW KIDS NEED SO THANK YOU DOCTOR LIBIN. PROMISE I WON'T SAY THAT MUCH THAT ANOTHER. I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT YOU AND DOCTOR LUBIN POINT OUT THAT THERE HAVE TO BE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS TO HOW WE DO STEM. IT REMINDS ME THAT WE STARTED THE STEM. IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION ARE VERY FIRST SESSION WITH THE CONVERSATION ABOUT SUPPORTING GIRLS AND WOMEN IN STEM. WE HAD SOME GREAT PARTNERS WHEN WE STARTED WITH AND GIRLS AND WOMEN STAND WEEK. THAT LED TO US TALKING ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS DISPARITY FOR OTHERS. WE FOUND OURSELVES IN A JUVENILE CAN'T. WITH THE TECH PROVIDER LEADING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT CODING. AND. WHICH WAS BRILLIANT AND I THINK THE ONLY COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR ALLOW ME TO TEACH CIVICS CLASS TO A GROUP OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS WHO FIND THEMSELVES. IN A JUVENILE CAN. WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GET ARRESTED TO LEARN ABOUT CODING? OR RE THAT SHOULD NOT BE YOUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO A SECTOR THAT PROMISES TO PROVIDE A MILLION AND A HALF JOBS AND SO I THINK YOU BOTH ARE. ARE CORRECT IN SAYING WE MUST ADDRESS THE KIND OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY FACTORS SO THAT ALL THESE GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS REACH MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE POPULATION SO WE WANT TO REACH. AND SO WE GOT A LOT OF IT WORK TO DO HERE. THANK YOU DOCTOR THE BEEN FOR ALWAYS REMINDING US THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND THE IMPACT POVERTY. AND GOOD MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND REALLY WRAPAROUND SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE OUR FAMILIES ARE PREPARE TO TAKE IN ALL THESE GREAT. RESOURCES. I I THINK IT'S A NICE SEGUE TO THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU SEE A STAFF IS DOING AROUND MAKING SURE THAT IN OUR WORK FORCE IT IS DIVERSE AND CLEARLY WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND WE LOOK FORTY HANDSOME THE GREAT BEST PRACTICES TAKING PLACE THERE. WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY DOCTOR TOMORROW. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING IT'S A PLEASURE FOR ME TO BE HERE THANK YOU CHAIR FOR THE INVITATION TO MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. I'M DOCTOR NAY CHAPMAN NOVARRO AND I AM THE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR DIVERSITY IN OUT REACH. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. OUR CAMPUS IS A GRADUATE CAMPUS ONLY ONE OF THE TEN UC CAMPUSES SEND REALLY FOCUSED ON HEALTH SCIENCE EDUCATION IN GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION WE ACTUALLY LIKE TO THINK OF. STEAM M. M. WITH EXTRA M. FOR MEDICINE BECAUSE HEALTH CARE OBVIOUSLY AS TO MEDICATION IS CRITICAL FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE. AYE IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD AS A VICE CHANCELLOR AND THE CAMPUS LEADER AN EXPERT ON DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION INITIATIVES AND BEST PRACTICES. AS WE SEEK TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION OF OUR OWN STUDENT BODY OUR FACULTY AND OUR STAFF AS WE PROVIDE. PATIENT CARE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH OUT THE DOCTOR LIVING ALLUDED TO. WE'RE HERE TO EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND SCIENTIST IN THIS KIND IN THE STATE. I AS WELL AS ENGAGING IN LIFESAVING OUR RESEARCH FOR THE SECOND LARGEST EMPLOYER I. IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE LIVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES ON OUR CAMPUS. OUR WORKERS ALSO ENGAGED IN THE COMMUNITY TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SENSE GO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN OTHER DISTRICTS. TO SERVE OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WE ALSO HAVE A STUDENTS. HAVE SCIENCE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE WORKING WITH THE TO THE TEACHERS YOU OF TEACHER SCIENCE CAMP TO HELP THEM TO TEACH. AS SCIENCE IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. I'M A PROFESSOR OF ANESTHESIOLOGY AND I PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS THE ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR FACULTY. I'VE BEEN STUDYING AND WORKING AND LEARNING LEARNING ON ISSUES RELATED TO STEM AND HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE DIVERSITY FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. MY WORK ATUCSF OFFICE WELL AS MY LIVED EXPERIENCES AS I COMPLETED BOTH PHARMACY SCHOOL AND MEDICAL SCHOOL. REALLY DRIVE MY PASSION FOR STEM EQUITY. AND LED ME TO SEEK TO BE AND BECOME THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR REGIONAL COLLABORATION TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN STEM WE AFFECTIONATELY CALL AT RECESS. REALLY BRIBING THE PROTEST. UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES IN STEM. ARGUABLY AS HAS BEEN STATED IN ONE OF THE REGIONS THAT IS MOST DENSELY POPULATED WITH CAREERS IN TECHNOLOGY SCIENCE. AND HEALTH CARE UTILIZING A REGIONAL COLLECTIVE IMPACT STRATEGY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO ACCESS AND SUCCESS BY BRINGING TOGETHER ALL OF THE PARTNERS IN THIS ROOM AND ALL OF. US WHO'VE BEEN HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY ALONG WITH THE YOUTH THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE REALLY NAVIGATING INEQUITIES ON A DAILY BASIS. WHEN TO JUST BRIEFLY SHARE MY PERSONAL STORY BECAUSE ELECTED ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS. I KNOW THAT AND WERE IT NOT FOR MY FAMILY AND MY COMMUNITY SUPPORT I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY. I WAS BORN IN MOBILE ALABAMA DURING THE NATIONAL SHAME OF JIM CROW SEGREGATION. FORTUNATELY WE MOVE TO CALIFORNIA WHERE I COMPLETED K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN NORTH HIGHLANDS. AND I WAS AN EXCELLENT STUDENT SUCCESSFUL IN MATH AND SCIENCE BUT I WAS ENCOURAGED. FACT. ONE TEACHER SAID YOU'RE YOU ARE REALLY SMART YOU COULD BE A GREAT EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT AND HAD ME TAKING SHORTHAND AND TYPING WHICH I USED WHEN THEY IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AS I WAS TAKING NOTES. BUT DESPITE THAT I REALLY I FOUND MY WAY. AND TEACHERS AND COUNSELORS WITH THEIR OWN UNCONSCIOUS BIAS YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT ABOUT THE THIRD GRADE PARTICULARLY FOR BLACK MEN. TEACHERS I HAVE BEEN COURAGEOUS BIASES AGAINST OUR KIDS AND SO IN THE CONTEXT OF TEACHING. ABOUT STEM PEOPLE HAVE PRECONCEIVED BIASES ABOUT WHO'S GONNA SIX SALAR SUCCEED IN THESE AREAS AND WHO WHAT WHO WILL NOT. I HAD THE BENEFIT A. OF A PERSISTENT I MOTHER WHO ACTUALLY BAT REALLY HELPED ME TO PERSEVERE AND AYE I DEVELOPED THAT PERSEVERANCE ALONG THE WAY. AND. WITHOUT HAVING HAD A ROLE MODEL I HAD NEVER SEEN A BLACK WOMAN PHYSICIAN I HAD NO ROLE MODELS I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE PATHWAYS TO ACTUALLY. GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL. SO I FOUND MY WAY TO PHARMACY SCHOOL. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS IN A SENIOR POSITION OF PHARMACY SCHOOL THAT I SAW MY FIRST HAND THE ROLE OF A PHYSICIAN AND HEALTH CARE TEAM AND I. WHAT REALIZE THAT THAT WHOLE HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO DO THAT I GAINED CONFIDENCE THAT I? HAD LACKED BEFORE. SO WITHOUT ROLE MODELS WITHOUT MENTORS WITHOUT A PATH THAT COULD BE EASILY NAVIGATED IT WAS CIRCUITOUS FOR ME TO FIND MY WAY AND THESE. KINDS OF INEQUITIES REALLY PERPETUATE TODAY THEIR BARRIERS THAT PERPETUITY INEQUITIES. MANY YEARS LATER I NEVER WOULD HAVE ENVISIONED THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN I WOULD BECOME THE FIRST. AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO EVER BE A VICE CHANCELLOR. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS HISTORY. YOU KNOW YOU ASK YOURSELF WHY SO SLOW YEAH. WHILE. AND YOU KNOW FOR YOU FIND THAT LITTLE HAS CHANGED IN THIRTY YEARS STEM CAREERS IN THE U. S. CONTINUED TO LACK THE DIVERSITY. THE PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS EMPLOYED INSTANT CAREERS HASN'T CHANGED OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES. WE FIND HAS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT THE EDUCATIONAL GAPS BEGAN SO EARLY IN MATH. WITH MATH BEING A PREDICTOR AND THAT THESE DISCREPANCIES CONTINUE PERSISTENT EXPAND. OVER TIME. ULTIMATELY ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF HISPANIC HIGH SCHOOL. GRADUATES COMPLETE THE A THROUGH G. CURRICULUM REQUIRED FOR CS YOU AND FOR YOU SEE ADMISSION THIS IS COMPARED TO FIFTY PERCENT ARE WHITE STUDENTS. THROUGH THIS REGIONAL COLLABORATION TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN STEM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE SAN FRANCISCO IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO AND ALAMEDA COUNTY. OUT BOARD OF EDUCATION TO COLLABORATE WITH OVER A HUNDRED BAY AREA PARTNERS IN BUSINESS EDUCATION NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT SECTORS AS WELL AS WITH YOU THAN THEIR FAMILIES THEMSELVES. TO REALLY IDENTIFY AND PROMOTE THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO CREATE A SEAMLESS SYSTEM CREATING THAT PATHWAY. AND AS WE'VE HEARD ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDINGS FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IS THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO PURSUE A STEM CAREER. IF AT AN EARLY AGE THEY SEE PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE THEM. THEY'RE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH STEM. SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED SOME INTENTIONALITY FOR THESE PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO START EARLY WE HAVE TO CREATE AND CURATE THEIR CURIOSITY AND INTEREST WE HAVE TO HAVE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES. FOR THEM WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES WE HAVE TO CREATE A CULTURE THAT'S WELCOMING COLLABORATIVE AND FOSTERS A POSITIVE SELF IMAGE FOR STUDENTS WITHIN THE TEACHER DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE. BREAK DOWN THESE BARRIERS THESE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS BARRIERS THAT. REALLY. FOSTER THE STEREOTYPE THREAT THAT OFTEN OF MINORITIES FEEL. EXPERIENCE IN THESE FIELDS. WE HAVE TO OFFER THE HANDS ON EXPERIENCES WITHIN THE FELL OF THE FIELD AND WE TALK ABOUT THE INFORMAL LEARNING DE. KEEP THESE ARE KEY TO REALLY MAINTAINING THE ACTRESS AND I AM PLEASED TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT WE'RE WORKING IN THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS AND. IN THE YMCA TO REALLY BRING THE SCIENCE EDUCATION TO THOSE PROGRAMS THIS WHILE. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE STEM MENTORS AND NETWORKS THAT ARE CULTURALLY ALIGNED. AGAIN YOU NEED TO SEE OURSELVES IN THESE ROLES WE HAVE TO EDUCATE AND ENGAGE OUR FAMILIES ON THE DIMMER DIVERSE AND EMERGING STEM CAREERS. AS YOU KNOW FAMILIES ARE SO CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS STUDENT SUCCESS WE HAVE TO REACH OUT TO THOSE PARENTS AND ENGAGE THEM AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND. HOW THEY CAN? PREPARE THEIR STUDENTS AT EARLY EARLY ON. SUPPORTING. OUR COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL APPROACH WITH THE COURT NATING ALLIANCE THE ALIGNMENT BAY AREA REALLY CREATES THE ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO INITIATE AND SUSTAIN ENGAGEMENT THEREBY PROVIDING. THE EVIDENCE BASE CULTURALLY INFORMS PATHWAY FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES I THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED TO ME TODAY AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. THANK YOU DOCTOR NAVARRO YOU REMIND ME THAT WE STARTED OUT CALLING THIS. STEM HEARING. WE CALL THAT THE. ECOSYSTEM. THAT WE USE THAT TERM AND I THINK YOU ADDED SOME INTENTIONALITY TO THAT TIME THAT. FOR US TO BE THINKING ABOUT MENTORS IN COACHING OPPORTUNITIES. INSTITUTIONAL BIAS IN HOW WE SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS ITEM WHERE WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF WHO PERSISTED. BEYOND. AND THAT BIAS AND AND THOSE MESSAGES THAT COULD HAVE DETERRED YOU WEAR LUCKYTHAT YOU ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. REMINDING US AS I KEEP TELLING MY DAUGHTER THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE DREAMING ABOUT BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR SCIENTISTS ARE AN INNOVATOR. HOW SHE'S ELEVEN YEARS OLD AND SHE SAYS SHE'S A SCIENTIST AND I TELL HER I WANT YOU TO JUST CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF AND DON'T? AND DON'T BLOW UP THE HOUSE. ANYTHING BEYOND THAT I WONDER TO DREAM ABOUT IT AND I THINK THAT IN THIS SPACE WE WE HEAR FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALL THE TIME. STRUGGLE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MAKERS SPACES ARE PARTNERS TO HELP THEM HAVE THE TOOLS FOR MAKERS SPACES SO THAT OUR OUR KIDS CAN DREAM AND SO THANK YOU FOR. I'M GIVING INTENTIONALITY TO THE USE OF THE TERM BUILDING A COMPLETE ECOSYSTEM. TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS AND INCLUDING MENTORING AND ROLE MODELING AND COACHING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. COMES QUESTIONS. I JUST THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER WOMAN HERE THAT DESERVES A PICK UP APPLAUSE I MEAN AND LAWS ARE VITAL. TO ALL THE WOMEN. AND I ONLY SAY WOMEN BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A WOMEN'S. HISTORY MONTH SO WE'LL JUST GIVE THAT A GOOD REASON TO GIVE IT OUT A SHOUT OUT. BEG YOU FOR MAKING HISTORY. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ALL OF YOU ABOUT HOW WE HELPED CREATE THE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE. PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE TECH COMPANIES AND OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY. WHO SAY WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE? A BENEFACTOR. YOU KNOW. LIKE SALES FORCE IN OUR AREA WE LOVE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED AND THE CONNECTION FOR PRE K. TWELVE. COMPUTER SCIENCE DISTRICT IT'S AMAZING. AS I WORK WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHO SAY WE DON'T HAVE ANY TECH PARTNERS OUT WHAT CAN WE DO. TICKET AND THAT. ARE DISTRICTS THAT WANT HELP AROUND THAT YOU SAY MISS LOUIS. SPENDING THEIR STEM PROGRAMS BUILDING THEIR MAKER SPACES I'M WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING. TO BECAUSE THE STATE IS NOT PROVIDING THE DOLLARS TO THE LOCAL TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'M THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE DEFINITELY NEED THE PARTNERSHIP AND HELP. OF OUR TECH PARTNERS IN A BUSINESS COMMUNITIES WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE US FROM MOVING FORWARD. ONE OF THE THINGS OUR ORGANIZATION DOES ANNUALLY IS CELEBRATE INNOVATION IN OUR REGION AND WE HAVE AN ANNUAL. EAST BAY INNOVATION AWARDS. ALL COMPANIES COMPETE FOR THESE AWARDS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND MANY OF THEM ARE BASED WHETHER THEY'RE MANUFACTURING OR ICICI OR. EP WE EVEN HAVE AN EDUCATIONAL WAR ACTS DUBBED TARGETED TOWARDS GROUP TO PROMOTE STEM. OF WHAT WE DO WITH THESE ARM COMPANIES IS TO CULTIVATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM SO THAT WE CAN MAKE CONNECTIONS AND THE CONNECTIONS OFTEN. OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AND DISK ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS SO ONE CONNECTION. THAT WHO STRONG AND ONE OF OUR AWARD WINNERS WAS OF PROGRAM CONVEX TO TAX. IT'S FOR OLDER ADULTS BUT IT WAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH LOTS PROCEED IS COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORKING WITH LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY. OF RECOGNIZING THERE WAS A NEED FOR HIRING ENGIEERING TAX BUT THAT THE VETS A HAD NOT HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF. OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE ACCELERATED MATH THAT WAS NEEDED FOR THIS POSITION SO THE COLLEGE WAS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO CREATE THAT. AND NOW WE HAVE A ROBUST PROGRAM AND WE WERE ALL ABLE TO BRING OTHER FINALISTS FROM OUR INNOVATION AWARDS AND WE NOW HAVE A POOL OF EMPLOYERS WHO ARE HIRING FROM THIS TRAINING PROGRAM. WE SEE THIS AS A MODEL OF FLEXIBILITY WITH OUR EDUCATORS PREPARING PEOPLE FOR WORK AND THEN PULLING ARM PLAYERS TOGETHER FOR HIRING. ANOTHER WAY IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYERS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT. OF ANY OFF CAN BUT THEY CAN OPEN THEIR DOORS SO THEIR OPENING THEIR DOORS THEY REALIZED THAT THERE ARE MANY INFLUENCERS IN A YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE. AND ALTHOUGH WE DO VALUE EDUCATORS WE KNOW THE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE. INFLUENCERS WE KNOW THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE WE KNOW THAT FAITH LEADERS ARE AND UNFORTUNATELY OR FORTUNATELY EVEN LIKE ATHLETES HERBIE INFLUENCERS. SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE MESSAGING TO PROMOTE STEM THROUGH THOSE INFLUENCERS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL. WILL WE HAVE BUSINESSES ENGAGE WITH FAMILIES AND WAS STUDENTS WILLIS HOW THE BUSINESSES. OF HAVE A SPOKESPERSON THAT LOOKS LIKE THE KIDS. SO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE LUNCH WITH THEM AT CAREER STEM AWARENESS WE WANT THE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE YOUNGER. CREW CAME FROM INNER CITY NEIGHBORHOODS THAT LOOKED LIKE THEM THAN WE HAVE TAUGHT TUESDAY MATH PIERCINGS BUT THE STUDENTS CAN RELATE TO THEM AND SAY. I CAN DO THIS BECAUSE YOU DID THIS. SO THOSE ARE IN WAYS THAT BUSINESSES CAN PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT THAT PROMOTION OF STEM EDUCATION AND ASPIRATIONS FOR STEM CAREERS WITHOUT HAVING THE ABILITY TO GIVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF CASH. AND IT'S VERY FULFILLING FOR THE COMPANIES AS WELL THEY LOVE IT THEY PROVIDE INTERNSHIPS THEY PROVIDE JOB SHADOWING. AND. AS MANY OF OUR EMPLOYERS THEY ARE BEING ONE OF THEM ALL THEY DO PICK UP A LOT OF THEIR INTERNS INTO STABLE EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY. IF YOU. OTHER PANELS. OUT OF TWELVE IT UCSF SIMILARLY WE ARE CERTAINLY PARTNERING WITH MANY IN THE BIOTECH INDUSTRY GENENTECH IS A BIG PARTNER. I'D ADDITION KELLY OUT AND WE HAVE A AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THROUGH A SEVERAL PROGRAMS WHEN A BRIDGE TO BIOTECH WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY COLLEGE. IN SAN FRANCISCO TO TAKE THE CITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WE USE OUR UNIVERSITY LABS IS A PLACE FOR THEM TO GET THEIR INTERNSHIP. AND TRAINING EXPERIENCES AND THEN MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE BOOK BIOTECH SPECIALLY AS WE'VE GROWN THE MISSION BAY CAMPUS SEE US AS A PLACE FOR THEM TOTAKE OUR GRADUATES. INTO THEIR INSTITUTIONS SO WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THEM AND THEY WANT OUR GRADUATES ARE THERE THEY BE FIVE THEY PROVIDE A CONDUIT FOR OUR. OUR CURRENT TO AND TO ANTICIPATING STUDENTS TO ACTUALLY BRIDGE THOSE I'M DIVIDE ACROSS BUSINESS AND IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL FOR OUR STUDENTS TO HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND IT'S AN ESSENTIAL FOR THE. IS INSTITUTIONS TO HAVE OUR RESOURCES WELL WE LOVE THE BRIDGE TO BIOTECH. NOT JUST BECAUSE I WORK THERE TWENTY YEARS AGO. BUT BECAUSE IT LET US KNOW THAT THERE ARE JOBS IN BIOTECH THAT EVENIF YOU DON'T HAVE A DEEP SCIENCE BACKGROUND YOU CAN WORK IN AND THAT HE WAS THE BEST PART. THE MORE YOU LEARN THE MORE YOU CAN AND YOU CAN KEEP GROWING CLIMBING AND SO WE LOVE THOSE PROGRAMS I WANNA SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT AND SO THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO ADD TO WHAT'S BEEN SAID IS THAT. MANY PLACES HAVE TO HAVE A CAMINO BENEFIT ACTIVITY AND THEY REALLY NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY KAISER I'M SURE IS ALREADY DOING IT. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A REALLY BROAD COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITY BUT BUT THAT THIS COULD BE THEIR COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITY AND THEY MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IT. SO AS PART OF THIS NETWORKING IS SAYING WELL HERE'S A WAY TO REALLY CONSIDER AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT OPPORTUNITY. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY I THINK? THANK YOU MISTER SEWER HERE AND I THINK BUILDING ON THAT I THINK WE HAVE A NUMBER OF REALLY IMPRESSIVE PROGRAMS WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS STEPPED IN. AND SUPPORTED SOMEWHAT LOCALIZED REGIONAL PROGRAMS MANY COMPANIES WILL SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH THEIR OWN LOCATIONS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THAT SORT OF THING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THE COMMITTEE COULD DO IS HOW CAN WE BRING THAT CONVERSATION AND BROUGHT IT TO WHERE WE BRING IN BUSINESSES THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY ENGAGE THAT ACTIVITY. AND TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE LIFTED UP FROM A LOCAL. PROGRAM TO SOMETHING THAT IS SCALABLE STATEWIDE WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER SO INSTEAD OF IMPACTING A HUNDRED OR THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE ACTUALLY IMPACTING A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND WERE ABLE TO ACCELERATE IT SO WE'RE NOT HAVING TO GO COMPANY BY COMPANY BY COMPANY SO IF THERE'S A WAY TO. AMPLIFY WHAT'S GOING ON AND BRING MORE PEOPLE TO THE TABLE AND AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE COMMITTEE IN THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO GET THAT CONVERSATION GOING. BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF INDUSTRIES THAT ARE ON THE TABLE OR PARK AT THE TABLE THEY WANT TO BE HERE AND THAT'S JUST HOW DO WE MAKE THAT EASY FOR THEM TO ENGAGE AND AND AND HAVE THAT COVERS. WE ACCEPT YOUR OFFER MASSAGE. BETTER FOR WHICH YOU HOUSE FOR. ARE WE GOING TO MAKE IT SO THAT OUR NEXT DAM HEARING IS REALLY MORE FOCUS ON NOT HEARING. BUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID. HOW DO WE GET THOSE COMPANIES THAT CURRENTLY ARE INVOLVED IN THESE WAYS INVOLVED IN IT THAT MEANS? LIFTING UP THE COMPANIES THAT ARE PROVIDED. YOU KNOW FROM THE EAST BAY ETA'S AND. THEM BRIDGE ABOUT TAKEN OTHERS THAT WE CAN LIFT UP. AND DO PEER MENTORSHIP BUSINESS TO BUSINESS PEER MENTORSHIP TO TALK ABOUT IT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WILL DO THAT SO WE ACCEPT YOUR OFFER. TO HELP AND THAT I KNOW THAT WE CAN COUNT ON THIS ENTIRE PANEL TO HELP HERE LOOSELY ABOUT. AT AROUND THE TIME WE DEVELOPING THE RACIAL SOME ACTION PLAN ON MY EMPLOYER ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH IS WITH THE COMPRISED OF VERY PASSIONATE ORGANIZATIONS THAT FUND AND THEY'RE ENGAGED IN STEM PROMOTION. MET WITH CONGRESSWOMAN LEAN. AND A WHAT WE DID IS WE COMPILED FOR EACH COMPANY. ALL THEIR OWN STEM PROGRAM AND PUT IN A DIRECTORY FOR HER. AND EACH OF THE REPRESENTATIVES WAS ABLE TO TALK ABOUT WHY THEY DEVELOP THIS PROGRAM WHAT IT MEANS TO THEIR COMPANY AND THEY'RE PLAYING GAUGE WENT. I THINK THAT RECOGNITION FROM LEGISLATORS GOES A LONG WAY WITH THE COMPANIES AND SO. IF THERE'S A WAY THAT. THERE'S SOME KIND OF RECOGNITION FROM THIS COMMITTEE OR GREATER ASSEMBLY FOR OUTSTANDING. COMPANIES BIG AND SMALL WHO ARE ENGAGED IN SOME PROMOTION AND ENCOURAGING STEM JOBS ALL THAT IS A WAY TO GET OTHER COMPANIES INVOLVED AND ALSO WILL GET A DIRECTORY OF GREAT BEST PRACTICES FOR REPLICATION. I THINK THAT WOULD BE EASY FOR US TO DO YOU KNOW THERE ARE. EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND. FORTY SENATORS AND WE ALL CARE ABOUT HIGHLIGHTING BUSINESSES THAT ARE DOING GREAT THINGS IN OUR COMMUNITY I THINK COULD BE VERY EASY FOR US. TO PROVIDE SOME RECOGNITION. AND TO LIFT THEM UP IF YOU ALL WOULD HELP US IDENTIFY THEM. I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY EASY FOR US TO DO. I ANYTHING FURTHER FROM THE COMMITTEE A ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. WELL I THINK WHEN I CAME AND I WAS EXPECTING TO BE THINKING ABOUT STEM. AS THAT'S THE TITLE OR DOING AND. BUT IT REALLY DOES REMIND ME ACTUALLY OF GOING BACKWARDS AND I MANAGED IT OFF HAND BUT I THINK IT COULD ACTUALLY BE A SOLUTION TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS. TWENTY TWENTY YEARS AGO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE STATE ACTUALLY FUNDED THROUGH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THROUGH A GRANT PROCESS. A HEALTHY START COORDINATOR. AND THE HEALTHY START COORDINATOR LIKE I SAID WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON STARTING A NEW PROGRAM IT WAS MAKING THOSE CONNECTIONS WITHIN THEIR. CITIES OR REGIONS AND FOR. MANY OF THEM IT WAS OF COURSE YOU KNOW LIKE I MENTIONED I GLASS EXAMPLES BUT THERE'S ALSO BUSINESSES AND OTHERS THAT WANT LIKE YOU SAY THEY'RE THERE THEY JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO. WHETHER IT BE CONTRIBUTE WHETHER IT BE. JOIN TOGETHER AND IN I THINK THERE'S EXAMPLES EVERYWHERE OF SOMEBODY'S ABLE TO GET. PORT FOR A ONE TIME EVENT. AND THEY WILL DO THAT BUT TO REALLY. MOVE FURTHER THAN THAT AND BUILD A RELATIONSHIP AND HAS TO BE KIND OF TWO FULL BECAUSE OTHERWISE. IT'S LIKE CAN YOU GIVE US THE US THEY DO AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE KIND OF DONE BUT AS THE CHAIR OF THE JOBS COMMITTEE. WE CONTINUE TO. IT'S AN ODD LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE FUTURE WORKFORCE GONNA LOOK LIKE. AND ARE WE PREPARING OUR STUDENTS FOR THOSE FUTURE JOBS WE KNOW THAT. WE ARE. MOVING IN ONE WAY BUT THERE'S OTHER AREAS WERE NOT DOING WELL SO THERE'S BEEN A BIG EMPHASIS ON. KIND OF RE LOOKING BACK AT CT  <u><c.green>WHICH IS A WHOLE NOTHER</c></u> CONVERSATION WE WON'T GET INTO THAT. BUT THE POINT IS NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO GO DOWN ONE PASSED AWAY AND STE TO MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER IT'S THE TWO YEAR THE FOUR YEAR OR. ARE PRACTICAL. WELL PAIN PROFESSIONS BUT THERE COULD BE A SIDE CONVERSATION AND ALL OF THIS IS MAYBE WE REALLY DO LOOK MAYBE IT ISN'T A HEALTHY START CAREER COORDINATOR BUT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING. LIKE A NAVIGATOR THAT COULD WORK THROUGH. IN THAT CASE IT WAS OUT OF THAT I THINK QUE EIGHT SCHOOLS OUT WHERE THEY. MAY KNOW TEACHERS WOULD APPLY BUT THEIR JOB WAS TO REALLY BUILD A BUILD UP. A COLLABORATIVE AND SO TWENTY YEARS AGO WE STARTED THE FULLER CHEN COLLABORATIVE AND THAT STILL EXISTS. SO THERE'S BEEN EVERYTHING FROM YOU KNOW MAJOR GARDENING PROJECTS TO LIKE I SAID UP MEDICAL CLINIC BUT ALL TYPES OF THINGS. BUT IT ISN'T JUST KINDA NONPROFITS THAT HAVE AND THEN BITE ITS LEADERS YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE LOCAL COUNCIL SO THEY REALLY GET AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ARE THE NEEDS WHAT CAN WE DO. BUT YOU COULD FOCUS AT MORNING BUSINESS TYPE OF STEM FOCUS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. QUOTE HEALTH RELATED OR HOLD PASSED IT SO THAT COULD BE AN IDEA BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS BASICALLY PAYING. UP THE SALARY FOR. AND I DON'T EVEN THINK IT WAS EVERY DISTRICT I THINK IT WAS THE DISTRICTS THAT APPLIED. NAM I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT COSTS THE STATE AND WHY THEY STARTED DOING IT. BUT. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY HERE NOW I KNOW THAT THERE IS I I JUST HEARD TODAY THERE'S A LETTER CIRCULATING TO REQUEST A PILOT TO REESTABLISH THE HEALTHY START PROGRAM IT WOULD BE AT THE AMOUNT OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND I KNOW THAT THE COALITION THAT IS. MOVING THIS FORWARD IS IS LOOKING FOR OUT LEGISLATORS WHO'D BE WILLING TO SIGN ON TO THAT LETTER AND HELP TO. TO BRING THAT EFFORT IRONING SOMETHING AND SO. MY STAFF HASN'T EVEN HEARD ABOUT THIS ONE YET NOW BUT. YOU KNOW WE COME OUT OFA BACKGROUND OF WORKING WITH HEALTHY START PROGRAMS THAT WE THINK THAT THEY ARE EXCELLENT. COMPLEMENT TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND STUFF. AND MAYBE pHEALTHY START BECAUSE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY THINK OF. YOU KNOW HEALTH AS A BUT THE IDEA IS HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. AND YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE GOOD LIBRARIES DO YOU HAVE GOOD PARK SPACE AND A HAVE AND THAT'S WHERE THOSE. THOSE BRIDGES ARE BILL BUT I COULD SEE THAT BEING VERY EFFECTIVE SO THAT YOU COULD BUILD COLLABORATIVE SO THAT THE MODELS YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOW OR EVEN WHAT YOU'VE DONE. YOU COULD COME TO TALK TO THESE COLLABORATIVE THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT BECAUSE IT IS REALLY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE. STATEWIDE I MEAN AS MUCH AS YOU TRY TO DO THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BUT GIVING PEOPLE. IN ESSENCE THE TOOLS ARE THE BACKGROUND AND THAT IT GIVE SOMEBODY A PLACE TO. MOVE TOWARDS. I'LL JUST SAY THE LAST THING IS I KNOW A LOT OF STUDENTS IN HIGHER ED HAVE A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THE INTERNSHIPS. THAT THEY NEED THERE ARE MANY OF THEM ARE REQUIRED IN THEIR LAST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL BUT ALSO IN COLLEGE. AND THAT EXPERIENCE IT SOUNDS GRAY. EVERYBODY LOVES THE IDEA BUT WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY KNOCKING ON DOORS TO TRY TO GET AN INTERNSHIP A IT'S NOT ONLY VERY DIFFICULT BUT THEN SOMETIMES SIX BARYONS. IS YOU KNOW I'M ANSWERING PHONES ARE FILING PAPERS SO I THINK THERE COULD BE A LOT OF WORK DONE ON THAT. WE'RE THAT WE'RE GONNA BRING THIS TO A CLOSE I AM AND I KNOW THAT STUNNED MANY ON THIS PANEL ARE DOING OTHER PANELS BECAUSE I'M GONNA SEE SOME OF THEM IN LESS THAN A MINUTE. AND SPEAK ON THOSE PANELS BUT NOT THIS YEAR SOME APPRECIATION FOR THIS PANEL AND THE RICH CONVERSATION. THAT WE HAD. AS ALWAYS I'M THANKFUL TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR REALLY PROMOTING DEEP THOUGHT AND HOW WE THINK BROADLY ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH ALL OF THESE ISSUES. THERE ARE NO SIMPLE EASY ISSUES HERE BUT THEY'RE IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR US TO WORK ON. NELSON Y. KNOWLEDGE. MY DISTRICT DIRECTOR OF SITTING TO MY LEFT VERY NICELY AND MY STAFF FOR ORGANIZING TODAY'S HEARING AND UP FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DIDN'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY.
