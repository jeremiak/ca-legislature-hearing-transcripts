IN THE DEPARTMENT AND WILL FOLLOW EACH BLOCK WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS SO [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- ON BEHALF OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL IN THE TWENTY THOUSAND IN AND SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS OF FAMILIES THAT MAKE UP THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTS -- GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT GIVEN UPDATE AND TAKE WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE -- I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY IMPORTANT START OUT JUST BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT THE MILITARY PART IN HIS HOUSE ORGANIZED WE HAVE FOUR MAIN COMPONENTS WITHIN THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA AIR NATIONAL GUARD. THE CALIFORNIA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD OUR YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS TASK FORCE WHICH WILL A TALK ABOUT A BIT LATER. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE MILITARY RESERVE AND THAT'S VERY MUCH LIKE AN AUXILIARY -- MAINLY VOLUNTEERS -- AND THEY PROVIDE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VALUE -- OR ORGANIZATION. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS EXTRAORDINARILY BUSY TIME FOR THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT -- WE'VE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF MITIGATING IN RESPONDING TO THE THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS THE CLIMATE CHANGES HAD OUR STATE. WHO PARTICIPATED IN A MAJOR FARMERS AND SEES WE WERE CALLED OUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN TIMES? THAT'S A LITTLE OVER ONCE EVERY THREE DAYS LAST CALENDAR YEAR -- FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN DEPLOYED ACROSS THE STATE AND WE ALSO CONTINUE. TO FIGHT AND WIN OUR NATION'S WARS IN SUPPORT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUE SEE OPERATIONS ABROAD -- WE'VE DEPLOYED. TO A LOT OF PLACES LIKE I WANT. TO WALK THROUGH EACH ONE SIX IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDS WE DEPLOYED TO IRAQ TO AFGHANISTAN. TO JORDAN TO CUTTER TO BAHRAIN TO KUWAIT TO KUANTN WILL BE CUBA TO NIGER TO CLOSE OF A IN UKRAINE ALL IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN SOURCE SOLDIERS ARE COMMITTED GLOBALLY. BUT THEY'RE ALSO COMMITTED TO THE STATE AND THAT'S WHAT DIFFERENTIATES THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM. THE RESERVES OR FROM THE ACTIVE COMPONENT STATE MISSION TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE LIVE AND WORK -- TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SOLDIERS DEPLOYED LAST YEAR WE HAVE THIRTEEN HUNDRED SOLDIERS DEPLOYED TODAY ACROSS THE GLOBE. AND WE FULLY EXPECT THE TEMPO NEXT YEAR THIS YEAR RATHER TO BE AS AS EXTRAORDINARY AS LAST YEAR'S WAS -- A COUPLE MORE TO BUT STILL GET INTO QUESTIONS -- OUR COMPUTER NETWORK DEFENSE TEAM TEAMS TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR CORE FOR PARTNERS. AND WE PERFORMED AT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SUBSTANCE LAST YEAR WE TALK ABOUT THAT IN SOME DETAIL ARE YOU THINK COMMUNITY PROGRAMS ARE USED CHALLENGE ACADEMY STARBASE CONTINUE TO BE WILDLY OVERSUBSCRIBED. A THEY ARE POPULAR -- BEYOND BELIEF. SO THE LAST THING ON LEAVE YOU FROM A STATEMENT TODAY'S IS PLEASE BE REST ASSURED THAT THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT A NATIONAL GUARD CALIFORNIA. IS COMPLETELY COMMITTED INVESTED IN THE ENSURING THE SAFETY OF FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SO I WOULD YOU WILL BE ASKED TO GO THROUGH A A CAN YOU TELL REVIEW OF A SPECIFIC TOPIC OR START WORK FOR YEARS I THINK NEMESIS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] ONE OKAY CERTAINLY. YES TO FOR THE NEW MEMBERS ARE. BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IT WAS CLEAR TO THE ACTION GENERAL MYSELF THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD A SIGNIFICANT READING THIS CHALLENGE BUT IT DEALT WITH UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT OF OUR SERVICE MEMBERS. ITS WE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM CALLED WORKFORCE ESSENTIALLY AN IN HOUSE HEAD HUNTING FIRM. IN IT'S NOT IT IT'S NOT A WEBSITE IT'S NOT A RESUME MIL IT'S INDIVIDUALIZED. ATTENTION TO EACH SOLDIER AIRMAN THAT'S UNEMPLOYED AROUND IN A UNDER EMPLOYED. WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW ALMOST SIX HUNDRED BUSINESS PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE. INDIVIDUALLY TO TO GET OUR SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN JOBS WHO WHEN THEY WERE UNEMPLOYED. WE'VE. WILDLY EXCEEDED OUR ORIGINAL GOAL OF REDUCING IN THE DEPARTMENT BY. A GUEST 50% IN TWO YEARS AND UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT NOW RESTED ABOUT 4% -- WHICH IS GREAT -- THE CHALLENGE WE'RE GONNA HAVE WITH WORKFORCE GOING FORWARD -- AS WE HAVE STRONG ECONOMY WE HAVE A WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AND THAT. THOSE CHALLENGES KIND OF COMPOUND -- ON HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO DELIVER VALUE IN WORK FOR WARS WE FOUND THAT -- DELIVERING VALUE OR FOR IS REALLY COMES -- TO LOOKING AT FOLKS THAT ARE UNDEREMPLOYED THOSE SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN THAT DON'T HAVE JOBS THAT THAT THE FUNDAMENTALLY SHOULD HAVE AND ALSO LOOKING AT THOSE WHO ARE CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED. OFTENTIMES CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE WE'VE DEPLOYED THEM SO MANY TIMES OVER YEARS THE COME BACK WITH SOME. HEALTH CHALLENGES SO WE WERE VERY HARD TO TRY TO TO TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY GETS LEFT BEHIND. AND I I THINK THAT'S THE REALLY UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION OF WORK FOUR HOURS. DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS ON WORK FRAZIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE -- EXPERTISE THAT CAN BE GAINED. WITH THEIR SERVICE ON YOU'RE FREE MECHANIC WHATEVER. WHEN WE LOOK AT THEIR SERVICES OVER NAY? QUITE IN THE WAY. OPPORTUNISTS WORKFORCE IT SEEMS LIKE THE WITH THE THE WAY THE STRUCTURE IS IS. YOU HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN WITH THEIR GI BILL FOR CERTIFICATION OR OR ANY OF THE OTHER PROCESSES OF THEIR QUALIFIED HIGHLY QUALIFIED -- FOR JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S A REDUNDANT KIND OF WORK. PROCESS GOES FORWARD IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO IN THIS PROCESS THAT COULD ACTUALLY HELP THIS PROGRAM. EXPEDITE. EIGHT EXPERT IN THE FIELD INTO THE WORKFORCE YES. I THINK -- THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO GO THERE IS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND OTHERS TO TO ENSURE THAT MILITARY SKILLS LEARNED AND EARNED IN THE MILITARY ARE. TRANSPARENTLY PORTABLE INTO THE CIVILIAN SECTOR -- MY COLLEAGUE DIFFERENCES BEHIND ME TODAY'S DONE SOME SIGNIFICANT WORK ON THAT BUT THEY'RE ALL THERE IS A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I THINK IT'S FRANKLY LOW HANGING FRUIT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD HAVE -- A HUGE CHALLENGE WITH THAT WITH THAT LEVEL OF TRANSPARENT PORTABILITY ACROSS THIS THE MILITARY TO CIVILIAN SECTOR. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF -- FOR NOT HAVE TO UTILIZE THE G. A BILL THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT. FOR THAT CHILD OF THAT INDIVIDUAL MOVING FORWARD. ABSOLUTELY [inaudible] IT [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA. THANK YOU CHAIR -- IN GENERAL THINK YOU'VE WITH PRESENTATIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR ON THE WAR FOR WARRIORS -- IN THE REPORT TO THE COMMITTEE AND MENTION SIXTY SIX HUNDRED PLACEMENTS AT SIX HUNDRED BUSINESSES HE SPEAK TO THE QUALITY OF THE THE NATURE OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE IDENTIFYING WITH FOLKS WHO ARE THE PARTNERS YOU'RE GETTING -- TO TO COLLABORATE HIGHER -- THESE FOLKS. ABSOLUTELY THAT IT REALLY RUNS THE GAMUT. WE PLACE PEOPLE IN TESLA. AMAZON WE PLEASE PAY ERA PLACE PEOPLE AT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WE ALSO PLACE PEOPLE AT HOME DEPOT WE ALSO PLACE PEOPLE THAT -- TO DO SECURITY GUARDS WORK SO IT REALLY RUNS THE GAMUT AND IT FUNDAMENTALLY DEPENDS ON THE SKILL SET OF THE OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOLDIER OR AIRMAN -- SO IT IT'S IT'S EVERYTHING AND YEAH WE CAN SHOW YOU SOME CAN BE SOME BACKGROUND OUT ON ON THE SPECIFICS OF ALL SIX HUNDRED BUT IT REALLY RUNS THE GAMUT. SO IT IT'S AT ANY SITUATION IT'S MATCHED UP IT'S NOT COOKIE CUTTER IT'S NOW YOU YOU THAT YOU HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF FOLKS TO WORK THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT MAKES OUR PROGRAM UNIQUE. AND THEN EAT MY CONTACT MY OFFICE HAS BEEN CAUGHT RICHARD SEE -- YOU KNOW INTERESTED IN HELPING FOLKS TO TRANSITION -- FROM -- THERE -- MOS NEWS -- TO TO CIVILIAN SECTOR CAREERS AND SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH -- CERTIFICATIONS AS THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ANY YOU KNOW SPONSORED RECOMMENDED LEGISLATION AND YOU COME ACROSS THIS DO YOU HAVE -- REQUEST OF THE OF THE OF THE LEGISLATURE TRYING FACILITATE THE TRANSITION -- WHEN IT COMES TO SORT OF A SPECIFIC SKILL SETS RIGHT I I THINK -- I THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH CAL THAT WE'RE WE'RE FUNDAMENTALLY EMBEDDED IN THE IN THE THE TRANSITION PROGRAM TAP -- SO I THINK WE CAN WORK WITH THAT WITH YOUR WITH YOUR OFFICE CAL BATS IN YOU -- TO TO EXPLORER EXPLORE WAYS TO TO TRANSFER FROM TO THE CIVILIAN SECTOR THINGS ABSOLUTE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD SAY ANYTHING. ELSE. WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH A GREAT PLEASE WOULD LOVE YOUR HELP AND EXPLAIN LÃ  HOW THIS IS -- TRANSFERABLE -- EXPERTISE PERFECT THANK YOU. AND CAN YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON HOW -- HOW YOU'RE PLACING OTHER -- OF BENEFICIARIES IN QUALIFYING CATEGORIES OVER VIOLATIONS SULA. YET IN TOUCH ON IN MY OPENING REMARKS BUT WE DO WE WE WE HAVE OPENED UP WORK FOR YEARS NOW TO EVERY VETERAN. ACROSS THE STATE EVERY SPOUSE OR CHILD THE VETERAN OR SERVICE MEMBER MY ORGANIZATION IS NO LONGER WHAT IT WAS WHEN IT STARTED TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE'VE EXPANDED DRAMATICALLY -- WE'VE EXPANDED IT TO ENGAGE WITH FOLKS THAT ARE COMING OFF OF ACTIVE DUTY CAMP PENDLETON OR OUT OF THERE FOR SPACES LIKE TRAVIS RUBIO. AND TRIED IT TO RAPIDLY INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE CIVILIAN WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'VE ALSO TAKEN THE EXTRAORDINARY STEP IN MY MIND OF GOING OUTSIDE OF THE STATE SO. IF YOU'RE A SOLDIER FOR BRAG YOU DON'T SERVICE IN IN IN A STAND FOR BRAGS AREA YOU CAN GO BACK HOME A LOT OF THOSE KIDS THAT SERVE THEIR COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA. SUPER WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT INVENTIVE WAYS OF WORKING WITH CAL THAT TO TO BE ABLE TO GRAB THOSE KIDS. WHILE THEY'RE DETERMINING IF THEY'RE GONNA COME OFF BACK TO SERVICE WE GRAB THAT IN IN RE INTEGRATE THEM QUICKLY BACK INTO THE STATE. AND KELLY CHAR IN IN EDT AND OTHERS ARE ARE WORKING WITH US. TO TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE. SERVICE MEMBERS TO APPLY FOR STATE JOBS OF IT IS A GREAT PLACE TO COME TO WORK AFTER THE MILITARY TO COME TO WORK IN SERVICE OF THE STATE -- AND IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE TO THAT DEMOGRAPHICS ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO TRY TO DO THAT. AND AND CAL TAP HAS BEEN EXPANDING PRETTY RAPIDLY SO CAN HOW IS THAT -- THAT SORT OF PARTNERSHIP GOING HOW HOW WELL ARE YOU FUNCTIONING WITH CAT AS AS I MENTIONED% EARLIER WERE COMPLETELY INTEGRATED WITH CAL TAP -- WE PARTICIPATE IN IN IT MOST IF NOT ALL OF OF THEIR PROGRAMS ON THE VARIOUS -- POSTS CAMPS AND STATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. AND AND JUST ONE OTHER -- QUESTION THERE IS THERE ARE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE SAME GOALS OF OF EMPLOYING VETERANS HAVE YOUR A AND METRICS LOOK COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. FOR THE THE COST PER PLACE BEFORE WORKFORCE IS GONE UP SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY A FUNCTION OF IN TWO THOUSAND LEVEL A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IF YOU REMEMBER AND WE WERE ABLE TO TO GRAB A LOT OF LOW HANGING FRUIT IF YOU WILL. NOW IT THE DEPARTMENT AND NOT SURE WHAT THE THE CURRENT EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE ACROSS THE STATE. MOST FOLKS THAT THAT WANT A JOB HAVE -- ONE AND IT BECOMES A FUNCTION LIKE I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE OF TRYING TO GRAB THE CIVIC CENTER UNDER EMPLOYED. IN THE MORE IMPORTANTLY. GRABBING THE SPOKES THAT ARE CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED TRYING TO GET THEM IN A POSITION TO WHERE THEY CAN HAVE A MEANINGFUL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. SO WHAT IS RIGHT NOW THE TO THE COST REPLACE THE TODAY IS ABOUT TWENTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A PLACEMENT. AND THAT MIGHT SOUND A LOT LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY NOT THE THE PRIVATE SECTOR COST PER PLACEMENT TODAY IS ABOUT FORTY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THE NEXT BEST COMPETING FEDERAL PROGRAM LIKE OURS THE COST REPLACEMENT IS NEXT ALMOST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WE STILL ARE BARGAIN. OKAY AND I'VE ACTUALLY ONE OTHER THING IN THE I REPEAT FUTURE NORTH. WE I OFTEN HAVE PEOPLE COME THAT EMPLOYERS COMING INTO THE OFFICE AND TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO HIRE MORE VETS. SO WE'LL LOOK AT HOW DO THEY GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU HOW WE YOU KNOW. WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR HIGH -- PUTTING ADDITIONAL EMPLOYERS ON REALLY VERY SIMPLE JUST BE REACH OUT TO OUR WORK FORCE TEAM ABOUT TWELVE FOLKS RIGHT NOW. A RUN BY AN EXTREMELY CAPABLE -- MAJOR SHANNON TERRY AND THAT THEY BE MORE THAN HAPPY -- TO TO GET THEM LINKED TOGETHER WITH OUR TEAM AND GET THEM ON THE LIST OF BUSINESS PARTNERS. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING BY THIS AFTERNOON YOU MENTIONED THAT OUR GOVERNMENT RULES CAN BE A AT A GOOD STEP FOR FOR PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE MILITARY WHAT SPECIFIC THINGS CAN WE DO. TO HELP BY TO HELP YOU MAKE THOSE MORE POSSIBLE YEAH. I THINK A LOT'S BEEN DONE ALREADY COMING AT THE STATE HAS DONE SOME EXTRAORDINARY WORK IN ENSURING THAT WE AT THE VETERANS PREFERENCE POINTS STILL APPLY AND AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S USUALLY IMPORTANT. I SEE NO SIGNIFICANT -- STUMBLING BLOCKS A ROAD BLOCKS TO TO EXECUTING THAT. THE TASK AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. EVERYBODY'S VERY VERY SUPPORT FOLKS EDT THINGS A GREAT IDEA AND THEY HAVE -- THEY HAVE A RELATIVELY ROBUST WELL SO I THINK. WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY WELL LOCK STEPPED OKAY SET FEELS LIKE YOU'RE ON TRACK AND I THINK SEVEN OBJECTIVE GREAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THE GENERAL IN YOUR OPINION A AND VETERANS PURPOSE POINTS OF A LINE I KNOW THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF ASKED A LOT ABOUT SIR CERTIFICATIONS AND AND ALL OF THAT I KNOW -- FOR FROM THE MILITARY STANDPOINT YOU GUYS AREN'T USED TO THE TRADITION OF OVERSTEPPING YOUR OPINIONS -- BUT WOULD IT BE SAFE TO SAY THAT INCREASING VETERANS PROP FROM POINTS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP A LOT OF THESE -- VETERANS GET THE PLACEMENTS COMING BACK. AND AS WELL AS LOOKING AT DIRECT SEARCH [inaudible] SHOULD [inaudible] CERTIFICATION -- FOR SOME OF THESE THINGS -- WITH DIFFERENT LIKE PILOT LICENSES SIGNED OUT WITH -- TRANSPORTATION CORPS YOU STILL GOT TO GO OUT AND GET EVEN THOUGH YOU DROVE EIGHTEEN WHEELERS YUKON THAT'LL AS AS I WELL NOW -- SO MAKING YOU. TOUCH BASE A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. YEAH I I I I THINK I'M IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO ADVOCATE FOR THE INCREASE VETERANS PREFERENCE POINTS AND I THINK I GET IN TROUBLE FOR THAT -- AND WE NEED TO DO MORE WORK WITH WITH CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND OTHERS IN THAT SPACE TO TO MAKE THOSE THINGS TRANSPARENTLY PORTABLE MAKE THOSE CERTIFICATIONS THAT YOU CAN THE MILITARY. DOUBLE ACROSS THE THE MILITARY TO PRIVATE SECTOR DIVIDE AND IF THERE'S FRANKLY KNOW REASON WHY THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE IF YOU CAN DRIVE A AN EIGHTEEN WHEELER. INTO IN FALLUJAH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRIVE AN EIGHTEEN WHEELER DOWN I FIVE FRANKLY SOMETIMES I FIVE LOOKS LIKE POLLUTION BUT BUT YOU GET MY POINT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OKAY THANKS. SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE BILL MISTER CHAIR. ALL RIGHT AND HOW ABOUT THE STATE OF ARMORIES OKAY YEAH THE STATE ARMORIES -- SAID THE STATE OWNS NINETY SEVEN ARMORIES IN CALIFORNIA -- THE CHALLENGING ASPECT OF THAT IS THERE ARE ON AVERAGE ABOUT SEVENTY YEARS OLD -- AND WITHOUT THE STATE'S SUPPORT AND FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS -- WE COULD NOT -- SUSTAINABLE ARMORY RENOVATION PROGRAM FEDERAL FUNDING FOR STATE ARMORIES NONEXISTENT. FEDERAL FUNDING FOR FEDERAL ARMIES THE STATE IS ALSO ALMOST NONEXISTENT -- IT IS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT IS THE ABSOLUTE LACK OF FEDERAL MILITARY CONSTRUCTION FUNDING COMING IN THE STATE -- SO WE RELY HEAVILY ON THE STATE TO MAINTAIN OUR REASONING CONDITION THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO THE SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN THAT WORK AND LIVE IN THEM -- BUT I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE ARMORY RENOVATION FOR OR SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM IN GENERAL -- REALLY HAS FOUR PRIMARY PILLARS. FIRST IS DIVESTITURE WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL OVER LAST YEAR'S I'VE DONE IT DIVESTING OBSOLETE ARMORIES ARE RESET SIMPLY ARE BEYOND ECONOMICAL REPAIR. AND IN THAT CREATES AND GENERATES CASH FOR US THAT WE PUT INTO THE ARMORY FUN WHICH WE IN TURN. CAN BUILD YOUR WRISTS WITH SO IT'S IT'S A GOOD IT REDUCES DRAMATICALLY OUR BACKLOG REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE. SO WE'RE TAKING THOSE THOSE PROPERTIES THAT WOULD BE SUPER EXPENSIVE TO RENOVATE WERE TAKEN WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCES COSTS -- THE STATE'S ALSO DONE A VERY VERY GOOD JOB PAYING DOWN -- OUR BACKLOG REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE AND I THINK TO THE TUNE OF TWENTY SIX MILLION OR SO SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THIS IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT AS WE CONTINUE TO RENOVATE APPROXIMATELY THREE ARMORIES PER YEAR. AND THAT'S NEW ROOFS ADA COMPLIANCE APPROPRIATE BATHROOMS ALL THOSE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO TO ENSURE THAT THE SOLDIERS AIRMEN THAT THAT WORK FOR US HAVE THE HAVE THE RIGHT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO WORK AND LIVE. IN THE LAST THING REALLY THOSE FOUR PILLARS IS -- OUR OUR PURCHASE OF OF NEW FACILITIES AND AND WE HAVE TO ONGOING RIGHT NOW WE EXPECT BREAK GROUND ON A NEW READINESS FACILITY THAT ARE THE JOINT FORCES TRAINING BASE LOS ELEMENTOS. IN THE SPRING. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY BUILDING A NEW STATE FUNDED HEADQUARTERS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND THAT'S ABOUT IT -- NEXT TO MAKE THEIR AIRFIELD SO NEW CONSTRUCTION DIVESTITURE. BUYING DOWN ARE A ARE OUR A OR BACKLOG REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS SUSTAINING THE ARMORIES THAT WE HAVE A REALLY THE FOUR PILLARS. OF OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN I IN MY OPINION VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL -- BEEN VERY FRUGAL WITH HOW WE DO IT -- BE WE HAVE A CHALLENGE IN THE DEPARTMENT WHERE WE HAVE TO FUNDAMENTALLY LOOKING TO THE FUTURE AND SAY WHERE WHERE CAN WE RECRUIT IN FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS WHAT IS A DEMOGRAPHIC LOOK LIKE WE'RE THE SKILL SETS THAT WE NEED. AND WE NEED TO PLACE THESE FACILITIES IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE DON'T OBSOLETE. WHEN THEY'RE BUILT A BUILDING IN THE TURN AROUND TEN YEARS LATER AND WE DON'T NEED BECAUSE WE MADE A MISTAKE ON WHERE WE PUT IT -- SO AND I THINK WE'VE MADE THE RIGHT CALLS -- SO. FOR DON'T TELL TO QUESTIONS. DO WE HAVE ANY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER. THANK YOU MEASURE THE SO THE DIVESTITURE APPROACH THAT'S BASED ON THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR THE STRATEGIC NATURE OF THE PROPER HEALTH BOTH SO IT IT'S IT'S THE LOCATION. IT'S THE ABILITY TO REPAIR IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT WOULD BE INHABITABLE -- FRANKLY SOME OF THE ARMORIES THAT WE'VE HAD IN YEARS PAST OF BLIGHTED THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHICH THEY WERE AND AND WE WE TRY TO DIVEST OF THOSE WE ALSO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE WHERE WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO RECRUIT IN FIVE TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS. AND WE HAVE TO TO PLACE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE LOCATIONS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WERE FUNDAMENTALLY A COMMUNITY BASED FORCE. SO WE HAVE TO BE IN THE RIGHT COMMUNITIES. I'M SORRY SO SORRY AT A DISTANCE OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- ARE. ARE ALL THE FUNDS FOR THE REFURBISHMENT OF THESE OF FACILITIES THAT YOU'RE RETAINING IS ALL THROUGH -- LAND CELLS OR IS THAT SOME OF THAT FROM THE BUDGET. UP SOME OF THIS FROM THE BUDGET ALSO SIMMONS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO ON SO YOU WORKING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S ABOUT THE MATCH. SUCH YES SO LET ME LET ME BE CLEAR SO ON MANY PROJECTS WE GET AT FIFTY FIFTY MATCH SO. HALF THE MONEY COMES THE STATE HALF CONSIST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN MY OPENING COMMENTS ON THIS WHEN I TALKED ABOUT FEDERAL MILITARY CONSTRUCTION DOLLARS THAT'S THAT'S MONEY SOLELY FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE PROJECTS FULLY FUNDED BY THE FEDS. THAT DOESN'T EXIST BUT THERE'S RIGHT ACTION FUNDS ABSOLUTELY -- SO AND THAT'S A GREAT VALUE TO THE STATE WHEN THE STATE PUTS IN ONE BUCK AND GETS TWO BOOKS BACK I CAN'T BE THAT I TAKE THAT ABSOLUTELY -- WE DO EVERY DAY -- IT. I LIKE I SAID I SET ASIDE LONG TERM QUESTIONS ABOUT OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT -- ARMY TO BECOME AN ISSUE -- IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY WITH REGARD TO THE NEED TO HOUSE -- MIGRANTS -- THAT ARE BEING -- NEGLECTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THAT IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT TODAY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THOSE WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO TAKE WHETHER NOT TO OPEN THE ARMOURIES -- TO NON DEPARTMENT USES YEAH SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT. LAST CALENDAR YEAR WE DID PROBABLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND SHELTER NIGHTS AGO ACROSS THE ARMORIES THAT WE HOUSE THE HOMELESS AND I'M NOT AND I'M NOT SURE WHICH SPECIFIC ARMY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT DEPENDS IF THE ARMORIES BEING USED -- WE CAN'T. OPEN EVERY ARMORY FOR HOMELESS SHELTERS BECAUSE THEN IT BECOMES A IMPACT ON OUR READINESS OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM OUR MISSIONS BUT WHERE WE CAN -- WE DO WE DO AND WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING CONSTANTLY OUT WAYS TO TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT HOMELESS INITIATIVES ALSO TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR MIGRANT AGED ESPECIALLY DOWN IN IN THE IN YOUR AREA -- SO WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO THAT IF YOU EVER HAVE A QUESTION AND JUST GIVE US A CALL BILL WALK YOU THROUGH THE WITHOUT KNOWING THE SPECIFICS AYE. CANNELLA JUSTIN SO THE FOCUS ON MIGRANTS NOT NOT THE HOMELESS ALTHOUGH THAT CERTAINLY CONCERNED AS WELL BUT FROM THE TEMPORARY NATURE HOPEFULLY -- OF OF THIS RIDE REQUIREMENT -- I THINK WAS A PART OF THE ISSUE I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO INTERPRET PAN AND ARE JUST NOW KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT QUITE OVER. WE HAVE FOUND A COUNTY FACILITY THAT'S NOT SO SURE THAT WILL COME COMING BACK PLEASE -- AND I'D LIKE THE STATE TO THE STATE'S ALREADY PUT UP SOME SIGNIFICANT MONEY. WHICH IS GOOD I DON'T A NEVER COME HOME EMPTY HANDED RIGHT RIGHT -- SO GLORIOUS NOT COMING HOME EMPTY HANDED ON THIS ISSUE BUT AT THE IT OUT IN A FEW YEARS TIME IF THERE CONTINUE TO PERSIST IN THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM. OF HOPE FOR THE STATE CAN BE SOLUTION ORIENTED BEYOND MONEY BUT HOPEFULLY THE WITH FACILITIES -- IF IT'S STILL NEED. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. I JUST LIKE TO MAKE COMMON BASED ON WHEN YOU HAVE. AN ARMORY IN A COMMUNITY GENERALLY. IF IT'S COMMITTEE AND IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IN THE IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT SERVE IN THAT IN THAT ARMORY. OUR COMMUNITY BASED IN COMMUNITY FOCUSED ON HELPING AT ALL MANNERS OF AND SO I JUST GOT TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW. AS YOU. DISSOLVE THE ABILITY YOU DISSOLVE THE SPIRIT NERO CAM IN GO BECAUSE IN CONCORD. YES I WAS -- YOU KNOW. GOING UP AS YOUNG BOY. THAT WAS THAT ARMY WAS COMPLETELY ENGAGED IN THE COMMUNITY IN SO MANY DIFFERENT FASHIONS. AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S A HUGE LOSS AS WELL AS WE SEE THESE GO. THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GET BACK THERE WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE THE THE CALL MOSCOW IS. THE NAME WHAT THE STATION THERE THEY HAVE THEY HAVE SOME PROPER THAT THEY WANNA SURPLUS LEAD WE SEE THAT AS POTENTIALLY VERY FAVORABLE FOR US WE HAVE -- WE CAN RECRUIT THERE -- WE HAVE A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN UNITS ALREADY THERE AND IT'S DEFINITELY ON THE ON OUR WATCH LIST TO TO DO SOMETHING THERE SIR. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU -- WHY DON'T WE GO ON TO USE CHALLENGE OKAY? SO WE'RE EXTRA NEARLY PROUD OF THIS PROGRAM IT LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE THIS IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT DOES RIGHT WE DO A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT -- FOR FOLKS THAT ARE NEW TO THE COMMITTEE OUR YOUTH CHALLENGE PROGRAM WE HAVE -- A THREE ACADEMIES THIS ONE IN THE LOS ARE SAN LUIS OBISPO AND THEN ONE IN STOCKTON -- THEY'RE FUNDED BY A SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE SPLIT 75% FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 25% STATE GOVERNMENT WITH THESE PROGRAMS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY IS TWENTY TWO WEEK RESIDENTIAL MILITARY STYLE. OF SCHOOLS THAT. SEEK TO REALLY EMPOWER -- KIDS THAT HAVE CHALLENGES EITHER ACADEMICALLY OR SOCIALLY THESE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY LAST CHANCE SCHOOLS. AND WE BRING THEM IN LIKE I SAID BEFORE THE MILITARY TYPE ENVIRONMENT WE TAKE A VERY HOLISTIC APPROACH WE LOOK AT ACADEMICS WITH LOOK AT PHYSICAL FITNESS WE ALSO LOOK AT AT ACADEMICS PHYSICAL FITNESS WE LOOK AT AND A VARIETY OF THINGS. TO TO TRY TO PROVIDE A HOLISTIC APPROACH -- TO DELIVERING VALUE FOR THE STUDENTS -- LAST YEAR -- WE GRADUATED ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE STUDENTS FROM ALL THREE PROGRAMS WE HAD ABOUT 87% RETENTION RATE. AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO BUILD OUT AND GROW THIS PROGRAM. I THINK WE'RE ONE OF THE VERY FEW STATES THAT HAS THREE PROGRAMS ARE THE MOST HOW ONE VERY FEW HAVE TO WE HAVE. THREE AND THAT WE'RE VERY VERY PROUD OF IT I THINK WE HAVE -- OF DELIVER A LOT OF VALUE TO THE STATE. MULTI QUESTIONS. YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THERE ARE OF SO WHAT. DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS A NEED OR DESIRE TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM IS THIS PROS WILEY OVERSUBSCRIBED MA'AM WITH. IT'S A SHAME WE THE THE KIDS WE HAVE TO TURN AWAY. ABSOLUTELY AT IT DOES SOUND LIKE IT -- GREAT PROGRAM AND THEN IS IT TOO EARLY TO KNOW WHETHER -- THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY HAS HAVING WITH HIRING COUNSELORS. I BELIEVE IT HAS. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. ENTER IS ONE OF THE FOLLOW UP. AS YOU MENTION THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE WIDELY OVERSUBSCRIBED ANSWER WHAT YOU WANT. WELL WE'D LIKE ANOTHER PROGRAM RIGHT BUT THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS TO APPROVE SO I'M NOT IN A POSITION TODAY TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM -- STANDPOINT OF OF OF DEMAND IN THERE'S A DEMAND THERE FOR AND THE CHALLENGES YOU KNOW WHERE YOU PUT IT -- AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO PARTNER WITH WHOEVER WANTS TO HELP US DO THAT. AND THAT'S WHY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN SHARE TECHNICAL ADVICE IN THE SUBJECT ABSOLUTELY AND WILL BE. PEOPLE WHO. GREAT HAVE A FOLLOW UP CONVERSATION WITH YOU ELICITATION WHEN WE CAN WE CAN -- UNDERSTAND THE OUTCOMES OF ABSOLUTE PROGRAM DOES PROVIDE ONE PER SHARE SPORTS SIR THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NO MORE QUESTIONS THEN WE WILL GO ON TO OUR LAST SUBJECT OKAY EVASIONS I KNOW YOU COVERED A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR OPENING BUT MAYBE WE CAN HERE'S MORE DETAILS. SO. AS I WAS AS AN EXTRA NO NO AT THE ACTIVATIONS -- ACTIVISTS I'M SORRY YEAH I MENTIONED IT IN SOME LEVEL OF DETAIL IN MY OPENING COMMENTS NOT A WHOLE LOT TO SHARE BEYOND THAT -- IT'S INTERESTING TODAY OUT MY AND MY BOSS IS NOT HERE TODAY'S ACTUALLY AMMAN JORDAN A HE'S VISITING OUR CAVALRY SQUADRON WHO IS CURRENTLY IN JORDAN. ON THERE WITH THE CALL THE JORDAN TRAIN AND EQUIP MISSION -- STILL BE MEETING THE SPOKESMAN RETURNING YOUR LATER IN THE WEEK. BUT I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOTICE IS THAT THESE DEPLOYMENTS THESE ACTIVATIONS DESCRIPTION SEE DEPLOYMENTS -- ARE NOT WINNING -- WE CONTINUE TO BE FULLY INVESTING GAUGE TO ACROSS -- EVERY MAJOR THEATER IN THE EUROPEAN. THEATER WITH THE DETERRENT SUPPRESSION AGGRESSION OR WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH OUR PARTNERS IN UKRAINE TRYING TO HELP THEM. UP -- TO THE CENTRAL COMMAND BUT WE HAVE -- THE MAJORITY OF OUR FORCES AND WE ALSO DO -- THEY ARE CALLED TO DO THAT WORK SO WELL WALL THE DEPLOYMENT CYCLES AND PARTICIPATION EMERGENCIES CATASTROPHIC EMERGENCIES LIKE THE ONES -- THIS FALL -- IT'S IT'S WHAT MY FOLKS DO SO. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DO IT AT FIFTEEN OF OBVIOUSLY THE INTENSITY OF THESE WILD FIRES IS INCREASING DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF PERSONNEL. TO AT TO MEET THE DEMAND WE DO. WE DO AND WHAT WE ARE CONTINUE. FOR WAYS TO INNOVATE -- IT'S NOT A MATTER OF MANPOWER AND NOVEMBER WITH THE WILL OF THE FIRE AND AND PARADISE AT THE SAME. TIME AND AND CERTAINLY -- IT WAS A BIG RELIEF TO HAVE YOU AVAILABLE SPAM. AND I THINK IT'S A SUPPORT YOU KNOW TO BEFORE MOVE OFF THAT SUBJECT IS THAT IF WE RUN INTO A SITUATION WHERE. OUR CAPACITY IS TAPPED OUT. WE HAVE THE FIFTY THREE OTHER STATES TERRITORIES THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FROM WHICH WE CAN ASK AND WHEN THEY WILL DELIVER. SO IT'S WE WILL NOT BE SHORT. I'M DISTRICT WHERE DID YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON FEDERAL BORDER DEPLOYMENT AYE AYE WOOD ACTUALLY AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS OF OUR OPERATIONS ON THE BORDER CERTAINLY SO. THE OF THE CURRENT STATUS ARE OPERATIONS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN PARTICIPATING ON THE BORDER. THEY ARE DOING SOLELY -- COUNTER NARCOTICS OPERATIONS SO MAJORITY OF THEM DO YOU INTELLIGENCE -- WORK WITH THE OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE WE HAVE MANY MANY SOLDIERS WORKING SECONDARY VEHICLE CHECKPOINTS. ON AND SPORTY OPS FIELD OPERATIONS THE PORTS OF ENTRY ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO BORDER -- WE ALSO HAVE SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN THAT MAN -- COME ACROSS THE TERRESTRIAL BORDER AND NOT THE PORTS OF ENTRY. HOW MANY PERSONNEL DO WE HAVE THEIR? THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT AND HAS THE MISSION ITSELF CHANGED ALL BETWEEN THE CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATIONS. NO -- THE EITHER MORE OR LESS IT'S THE IS IT HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL OKAY -- AND THAT IS IT THIS THEIR ROLE IS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- IT'S PERSONAL IS DOING ITS ABSOLUTELY DISTINGUISHABLE. AND WE WENT AND MADE GREAT STRIDES TO ENSURE THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY DISTINGUISHABLE. THERE ANY INCIDENTS OF USE OF FORCE BY ANY OF OUR PERSONNEL KNOWN AS WORK NONE -- AND WHAT'S THE COST OF THIS AT THIS POINT -- I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I'LL GET IT TO YOU. MILLIONS OF ABSOLUTELY AS A REIMBURSABLE. IT'S SERVE IT IS WELL THERE AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT STAND THESE THIS THE SOLDIERS AIRMEN THAT ARE ON THE BORDER THERE UNDER WHAT THEY CALL TITLE THIRTY TWO AUTHORITIES SO. THAT MONEY FLOWS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTO THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT DOESN'T TOUCH THE STATE AT ALL OKAY. SO IN FACT IT'S NOT REIMBURSABLE PER SE THE CHALLENGE I THINK WHERE WE TALK ABOUT REIMBURSABLE SIN AND THIS IS. I THINK IT FOR A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T KNOW IS THIS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS NOT BEING REIMBURSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FOR ANY OF THIS -- WHICH I FIND. EXTRAORDINARY. SO BUT TO ST ME IT ME -- TO WITH REGARDS TO OUR PERSONNEL WHO ARE THERE THERE'D BE THE THE IT'S NOT REIMBURSABLE BECAUSE IT'S BEING PAID DIRECTLY BY THE FEDERAL AYE THAT'S CORRECT THERE'S NO DIRECT COST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NAY ON WHATEVER WE WOULD -- IN THE FUTURE IF THERE'S NO NONE. THANK YOU YOU BET [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY UNIFORMED CBP OFFICERS BACK IN THE FIELD -- BY OUR PRESENCE THERE -- TO DATE. WE'VE ASSISTED OR PARTICIPATED IN THE SEIZURE OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. OF DRUGS METHAMPHETAMINE FAN AND ALL OPIOIDS MARIJUANA -- THAT CAME THROUGH THE PORTS OF ENTRY OUR SOLDIERS AIRMEN MANDY AT SECONDARY VEHICLE CHECKPOINTS. GOOD JOB THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT AND AND WE WEREN'T GOING TO SKIP THE DISCUSSION BUT MAYBE SENT TO BROUGHT IT UP ON THE TRANS GENDER. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND -- CAN WEAR OUT WHERE WE'RE GOING. ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES THE NATIONAL GUARD SHOW. WE'RE COMPELLED BY STATUTE TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELATIVE TO FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD SO WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THOSE RULES. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A IF YOU'RE HOWEVER THE GENDER IDENTIFY IT DOESN'T MATTER TO US WE DON'T ASK WE DON'T CARE AS LONG AS YOU CAN FIGHT WE DON'T CARE. WHAT YOU AYE GENDER IDENTIFY ASSET -- AND WE TAKEN FOLKS IN. IN WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE AND WE WE SIMPLY DON'T CARE -- I BELIEVE THAT THAT -- THAT THE BANWILL BE LIFTED AGAIN I I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING IT WILL BE AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT. IF YOU'RE TRANSGENDER YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE MILITARY REGARDLESS OF YOUR COMPONENT THE THE THE THE LAW OR THAT THE COURT. THE AT THE COURT ORDERED. DOES NOT. BOUNCE YOU OUT YOU CAN STAY IF YOU'RE THE GOING THROUGH GENDER REASSIGNMENT SURGERY YOU CAN DO THAT AS WELL CURRENTLY -- NOBODY'S NOBODY'S GONNA KICK YOU OUT THESE THEY FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT IT DID WAS CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR -- THEN I I WHICH ONE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY WAS WHERE THE YEAH I WAS AND THE REASON I SAID WE WERE GOING TO SKIP IT IS BECAUSE WE HAD THE QUESTION THERE BUT THERE IS THERE'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING FOR ONE MORE COURT CASE WAS -- SET THAT UP CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT BACKGROUND SURE. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER. THAT IS SO THAT WAS A GREAT DANCER AND I YOU KNOW IT IS A MEMBER THOSE TWO COMMUNITY MIGHT IMAGINETHERE'S A TIME IN MY LIFE I NEVER THOUGHT SOMEONE WAY WHAT YOU'RE WEARING WOULD SAY SOMETHING.
