BUILDING CODE TO MEET THE SOLAR

00:45:12.242 --> 00:45:15.045
REQUIREMENTS ONE OF IT IS ONE OF

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:16.547
THOSE WAYS IS LEASING.

00:45:16.613 --> 00:45:19.516
WHERE -- THE PANELS CAN --

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:22.686
BECAUSE ZERO MONEY UP FRONT WAS

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:24.421

NUMBER ONE I'M NOT -- THIS BILL

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:47.111
IS IS ONLY REDUCING THE SOLAR

00:45:47.177 --> 00:45:48.612
MANDATE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WE

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:50.614
ARE WE WANT THEM TO REBUILD A

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:51.381
HOME THERE'S GONNA BE FIRE

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:52.216
RESILIENT.

THAT I THINK IS.

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.898
THE ELEPHANT ROOM IS THAT.

00:46:07.965 --> 00:46:08.932

HERE THAT THAT WERE PRODUCING

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:11.702
MORE SOLID THAN WE ACTUALLY NEED

00:46:11.768 --> 00:46:13.003
AND WE HAVE THE VALLEY IF THEY

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.805
WERE IF THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY

TO BE ABLE.

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:16.640
TO FILL IN THAT GAP AT THE

00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:17.207
BOTTOM I THINK IT WOULD BE

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:18.876
TOTALLY PROBATE BUT AT BUT YOU

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:19.476
REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS

THAT.

INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T COVER

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:22.579

ENFORCE THAT MAKE THEIR HOME

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:31.021
SAFER TO FIRE SOLAR DOES NOT DO

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.389
THAT IT SIMPLY.

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:33.690

NOT LIMITING IT TO THAT THEY

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:41.498
CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A

THE U. S. IS TO CREATE.

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:49.799
PAPER RECEIPTS -- SO THESE ARE --

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:51.501
TOTALLY UNNECESSARY AND IF YOU

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:54.571
TALK TO RECYCLERS MANY RECYCLERS.

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:56.673
HAVE DIFFICULTY RECYCLING THE

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.742
PAPER RECEIPTS BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:52:58.808 --> 00:53:00.810
VERY SMALL AND THEIR SYSTEMS

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:01.811
HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME CATCHING

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:02.279
THEM.

COMPOST -- THESE RECEIPTS ARE

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:09.052
NOT COMPOSTABLE BECAUSE OF THE

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:19.362

OPPOSITION WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:24.568
HOW THE RECEIPTS ARE RENEWABLE

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:25.602
BECAUSE TREES ARE RENEWABLE.

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:26.202
AND BY RENEWABLE THEY MEAN BY

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:27.137
WHAT YOU CUT THE TREES YOU CAN

00:53:27.203 --> 00:53:28.805
REPLANT THEM AND THAT'S THEIR

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:30.540
DEFINITION OF RENEWABLE WHICH I

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:31.908
I DISAGREE WITH SO.

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:33.577

00:53:56.499 --> 00:53:58.134
CONTAMINANTS THAT WE SEND ALONG

00:53:58.201 --> 00:53:59.502
WITH OUR RECYCLABLES.

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:01.037
MANY CITIES ARE FORCED TO

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:03.506
RETHINK ABOUT -- RETHINK WHAT

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:05.642
THEY ARE COLLECTING IN THEIR

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:05.875
SYSTEMS.

00:54:05.942 --> 00:54:08.278
AND IT REALLY IS FORCING US TO

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:09.980
THE STATE TO RETHINK OUR WHOLE

00:54:10.046 --> 00:54:11.348
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:13.116
PART OF THAT IS FOCUSING ON THE

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:15.285
FIRST ARE IN THE THREE R'S AND

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:16.686
THAT'S REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:17.687
WASTE WE GENERATE.

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.522
IF FOR LOOKING AT REDUCING WASTE

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:20.390
PROBABLY THE EASIEST THING WE

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:22.325
CAN DO IS GET RID OF THE THE

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:24.327
MATERIALS THAT SOMEBODY HANDS TO

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:25.895
US THAT WE DON'T WANT.

00:54:25.962 --> 00:54:28.932
THAT WE HOLD ON TO UNTIL WE GET

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:31.067
TO NEXT TRASH CAN AND THROW AWAY --

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.202
THIS BILL DOES NOT PANDER SEATS

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:32.836
IT JUST SAYS THE RECEIPTS MUST

00:54:32.902 --> 00:54:34.170
BE PROVIDED ONLY TO THOSE WHO

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:36.106
ACTUALLY WANT THEM WHICH IS A

00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:37.641
VERY COMMON SENSE MOVE.

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:41.978
THANK YOU.

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:43.446
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M BILL

00:54:43.513 --> 00:54:44.614
ALLEY -- WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:46.349
WORKING GROUP -- THIS BILL

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:47.350
THERE'S A HEALTH ISSUE HERE AND

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.685
IT'S BEEN DOUBLE REFER BUT NOT

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:49.552
TO HEALTH COMMITTEE AND I THINK

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.054
IT'S APPROPRIATE TO QUICKLY

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:52.522
ADDRESS THAT HERE -- THESE

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:54.391
RECEIPTS HAVE BISCAYNE ALL A OR

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:56.693
BISCAYNE ALL ELSE IN THEM IT FOR

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.261
A WHILE WE WERE SAYING BPA FREE

00:54:58.328 --> 00:55:00.630
RECEIPTS IT TURNS OUT THAT BE PS.

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:02.565
MUCH LIKE DRINKING WATER BOTTLES

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:04.768
NOW SAY BPA FREE MOST OF THEM

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:07.103
HAVE BE PS ARE BISCAYNE ALL ELSE.

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.371
BUT SCIENCE IS SHOWING US THAT

00:55:08.438 --> 00:55:10.507
BPA HAS REALLY NEGATIVE EFFECTS

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.642
ON PREGNANT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:14.678
FETUSES AND ADULTS -- AND

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:16.813
SOMETHING LIKE 90% OF AMERICANS

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.048
THAT BP AND THEIR URINE WE WERE

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:19.549
ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:21.384
LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.186
THE DAMAGING IMPACTS OF THE PA

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:25.021

THAT WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR --

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:30.560

BE HOLDING YOUR BODY LAST TIME

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.097

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:34.964
EFFECTS.

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:37.434
ON OVER 80% OF AMERICANS THAT BP

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.369
ASSN THEIR URINE AND SO THERE

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:40.637
ARE HORMONAL EFFECTS OF SUSHI

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:41.738
WITH THIS WE THINK IT'S A GOOD

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:43.807
IDEA TO NOT HAVE PEOPLE TOUCHING.

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:45.542

CHAIR AND MEMBERS MET CERTAIN

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:26.910
THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:29.312
ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN OPPOSITION

00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:30.914
TO THE BILL -- WE BELIEVE THAT

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.615
PROPOSING A MANDATORY ELECTRONIC

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:33.516
OR SEEN AS THE DEFAULT

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:35.318
TRANSACTION AS A RECORD BETWEEN

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:36.753
THE CONSUMER IN THE BUSINESS IT

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.954
COMES WITH UNIQUE IMPACTS FOR

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:39.489
THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY.

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:40.590
IT MAY SEEM THAT THESE

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:42.492
ELECTRONIC RECEIPTS ARE SUPER

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:43.993
COMMON PLACE AND THERE'S NO

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.962
QUESTION THAT SOME RESTAURANTS

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.830
USE THEM IN SOME BUSINESSES USE

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:47.497
THEM.

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:49.132
BUT THEY ARE NOT WIDESPREAD AND

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:50.900
IT DOESN'T CHANGE WITH THE FLIP

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.368
OF A SWITCH THERE'S A LOT THAT

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:53.970
GOES ON THE BACK AND IT'S QUITE

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:54.838
COSTLY.

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:56.206
SO I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY WALK

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:57.574
YOU THROUGH THAT.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.775
A LITTLE BIT IS CERTAINLY A LOT

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:01.311
OF THE GOAL TO GO -- AND ADDRESS

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:03.680
PAPER WASTE BUT THIS COMES WITH

00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:04.781
A LOT OF FINANCIAL COST

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:07.050
LOGISTICAL HURDLES -- AND SOME

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.952
CONSUMER PRIVACY IMPACTS THAT WE

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:11.354
WANTED TO ADDRESS HERE TODAY --

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:12.422
MOST BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:13.623
STATE ARE USING SOME SORT OF

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:15.091
POINT OF SALE SYSTEM.

00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:16.526
NOT ALL POINT OF SALE SYSTEMS

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:18.761
ARE EQUIPPED NOW TO DEAL WITH

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:20.797
ELECTRONIC RECEIPTS AND SO WHAT

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:23.600
IT OFTEN REQUIRES IS A SOFTWARE

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:25.268
UPGRADE OR A FULL CHANGEOVER OF

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:27.237
A POINT OF SALE SYSTEM AND THE

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:28.738
NUMBERS THAT WE KEEP HEARING.

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.106
FROM INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS OR

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.108
SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THE THIRTY

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:32.775
FIVE THOUSAND AND FORTY THOUSAND

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:33.843
DOLLAR LEVEL TO EITHER DO THE

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:38.147
SOFT GRADE OR MORE EXPENSIVELY

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:38.748
TO SWAP OUT THE POINT OF SALE

00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:39.515
SYSTEM.

00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:41.317
SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE WAY

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:42.719
THIS BILL IS STRUCTURED I KNOW

00:58:42.785 --> 00:58:44.287
IT'S BEEN SAID IT MANY TIMES

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:46.789
THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S AN OPTION.

00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:48.958
OUT OF THE GATE IT'S A MANDATE

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.493
THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE AN

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.095
AVENUE FOR THE ELECTRONIC

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:54.430
RECEIPT THAT'S WHERE THE COST

00:58:54.497 --> 00:58:56.432
IMPLICATIONS COMMON RESTAURANTS.

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:58.501
AT THE SAME TIME YOU CONTINUE TO

00:58:58.568 --> 00:58:59.802
OFFER THE SAME LANE THAT YOU

00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:00.803
HAVE NOW WHICH IS THE

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.572
TRADITIONAL PAPER RECEIPT SO IT

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:04.574
IS A MANDATE TO GO DOWN THAT

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:06.342
ROAD OF UPGRADING YOUR SOFTWARE

00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:08.211
IN YOUR LACK CONICS WHICH AGAIN

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:09.412
COMES AT GREAT COST.

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:10.813
IT COMES AT GREAT COST TO

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.548
INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS AND EVEN

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:14.284
IF YOU'RE IN A FRANCHISE MODEL

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:16.185
THAT FRANCHISE IS TREATED AS AN

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.387
INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS BY THE

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:19.689
CORPORATION IN MANY CASES SO

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:21.357
THOSE COSTS ARE BORNE.

00:59:21.424 --> 00:59:23.326
BY THE INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISEE OR

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:26.429
FRANCHISE OR LOGISTICS IF YOU

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:28.031
IMAGINE A FAST PACE RESTAURANT

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:30.066
ENVIRONMENT WITH A FAST CASUAL

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:31.434
OR A QUICK SERVICE TYPE

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:32.402
RESTAURANT.

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:34.003
NOW WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT EACH

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:36.072
TRANSIT ACTS EACH TRANSACTION

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:37.874
TAKE MORE TIME BECAUSE WE'RE

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:40.443
GOING TO BE ASKING -- FOR EMAIL

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.378
OR CELL PHONE INFORMATION OR

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:43.513
SOME PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:45.248
INFORMATION TO GET SOMEONE

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:46.616
ELECTRONIC RECEIPT.

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:47.583
THAT'S GOT LOGISTICAL AND

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.452
OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS FOR FOR US

00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:50.520
ON OUR END AND CERTAINLY

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:52.288
NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE GUEST

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:53.890
EXPERIENCE.

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:56.192
THE ISSUE APPEARS TO BE DRIVEN

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:58.728
BY PAPER WASTES AND THE STAFF

00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:01.364
ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.099
THAT PAPER WASTE FROM THIS FRONT

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:04.567
IS NOT.

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:06.669
DETECTABLE IN CALIFORNIA NOT NOT

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:08.037
QUANTIFIABLE AS IT RELATES TO

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.939
PAPER RECEIPTS THE OTHER ISSUE

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:11.441
THAT CONTINUES TO COME UP IS

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:12.642
CHEMICALS.

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.344
AND SO I GUESS WE'RE LEFT ASKING

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:15.411
IN RESTAURANTS ON THE GROUND --

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:18.715
LEFT ASKING WHY CAN'T WE USE

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.516
TRADITIONAL RECEIPTS AS AN

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:23.019
OPTION THAT DON'T HAVE THE

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:24.587
CHEMICALS IN QUESTION.

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.255
THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:27.390
OTHERWISE WE THINK THAT THIS

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.926
MANDATE IMPOSES COSTS ON US --

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.527
CREATE SOME PRIVACY CONCERNS FOR

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.196
OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.597
NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE GUEST

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:36.299
EXPERIENCE IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:37.967
SO WITH THAT WE ARE OPPOSE THANK

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:41.938
YOU THANK YOU.

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.272
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:44.007

SOMEONE NUMBER GARCIA -- I HAVE

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:06.081
A MORE A MORE OF A COMMENT ABOUT

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:09.018
THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR AS THE

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:11.153
DEFINITION FOR SMALL BUSINESS.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:11.654
AND I KNOW IT IS IN SAN

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.955
FRANCISCO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:13.856
CLEAR DEFINITION HERE IN THE

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.524
LEGISLATURE WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:17.660
DIFFERENT THINGS OUT THERE.

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:19.662
I'M NOT SURE.

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.263
IF IT'S THE BEST DEFINITION I'M

REVISIT THAT I WAS SEEING A

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:26.602
LITTLE BIT OF QUICK MATH --

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:28.537
BEFORE I CAME IN AND I THINK

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.206
ABOUT COMMUNITIES LIKE SOUTH LA

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:33.108
WHERE THEY HAVE LITTLE MARKETS.

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:33.876
AND I LOOK AT GROSS RECEIPTS

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.277
THEY MIGHT BE HITTING CLOSE TO

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:37.213
THAT ONE MILLION DOLLAR ON DOWN

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.581
PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THE WIFI IN

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:40.049

IMPACT ON THE VERY SMALL BIZ

HEARD OR OR NOT BUT I MEAN.

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:55.317
HOW EXPENSIVE OR INEXPENSIVE IS

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.386
THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT THE YOU CAN

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:59.054
SEE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.389
ALREADY MOVED TO THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:02.391
BECAUSE PROBABLY IN THE LONG RUN?

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:04.193
CHEAPER ON THEIR BOTTOM LINE --

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:06.662
MUCH OF THE NEWER TECHNOLOGIES

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:10.132
ACTUALLY COME IN LESS EXPENSIVE

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.167
THAN SOME OF THE OLDER OR LEGACY

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:13.836
TECHNOLOGY THAT MANY SYSTEMS

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.204
HAVE BEEN IN PLACE WHICH IS WHY

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.872
YOU FRANKLY I'VE SEEN.

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.641
SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES I DO

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:19.875
WITH IT TO GET THE TRADITIONAL

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.644
QUITE A CREDIT CARD SWIPE OR

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.112
MACHINES FROM THE BANKS WAS YOU

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:24.947
KNOW QUITE QUITE COSTLY SAID.

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:26.582
THESE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:31.453
HAPPENS TO BE LESS EXPENSIVE IN

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.888
MY OPINION NOW.

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.089
HAVING SAID THAT -- MANY SMALL

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:34.923
BUSINESSES THAT JUST THEY HAVE A

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.592
CERTAIN HABIT OF DOING BUSINESS

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:37.192
A CERTAIN WAY SO WHAT WE'VE

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:38.794
TRIED TO DO IS FIND A DEFINITION

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:42.031
SOME NOT TO BE A BURDEN -- TO

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:43.532
SMALL BUSINESS BUT AS YOU CAN

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:44.833
SEE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES EVEN

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.834
WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE FROM THE

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:47.169
COUPLE HAVE ALREADY MOVED IN

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:48.470
THIS DIRECTION I THINK.

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:51.173
A LOT OF IT IS REALLY JUST BASED

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.375
ON COMFORT WITH TECHNOLOGY ONCE

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:54.476
THEY MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION THEY

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:55.277
FIND OUT IT'S ACTUALLY

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:57.413
INCREDIBLY EASY TO USE SO THEY

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.415
ACTUALLY -- HAVE MAY HAVE A

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:00.716
BREAST [inaudible]

ABOUT THE THE GROSS INCOME OF A

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:28.110
MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE IF YOU

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.395
THEIR DOING OTHER THINGS I MEAN.

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.630

YOU'RE ON THE COUNTRY LIKE ME.

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:56.438

THE THINGS THAT WERE GOOD AND

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.659

IN THE COUNTRYSIDE OF A LOT OF

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.732
CONCERNS THERE -- THERE ONE

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:24.900

THEIR RAISED -- A BROW FOR ME --

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.172
TALKING ABOUT WITH WITH THE

CHEMICALS WITH THIS -- BPA B. P.

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.477

RECEIVES PAPER STRAWS SO.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:48.757
THIS RAISES THE QUESTION.

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:50.025
ANYWAY IN IN INTEL I CAN LOOK AT

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.427

TO WORK WITH YOU AND FIGURE OUT

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:01.603
HOW.

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:07.509
HOW THIS COULD -- COULD WORK IN

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:08.010
YOUR IN YOUR PART OF THE

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:10.379
DISTRICT.

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:10.946
THANK YOU SOME MEMORABLE ONE

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.147
DOES.

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:12.881
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.416
TING -- CAN I JUST ASK.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:15.384
YOUR GOAL OBVIOUSLY IS TO REDUCE

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:16.351
WASTE WHICH IS IT THAT'S A GOOD

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.453
THING BUT GIVEN THE OPPOSITION

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.321
IN THE COMMENTS THAT YOU'VE

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:20.589
HEARD TODAY WHICH I'M SURE

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:21.190
YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:21.990
PROCESS.

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.992
MAY I ASK WHAT YOUR OPPOSITION

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:26.895
IS TO ALLOWING -- THE MARKETS TO

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:27.963
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.598
TO GO PAPERLESS WHICH AS YOU

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:32.935
STATED MANY STORES HAVE DONE

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.169
ALREADY I'M JUST CURIOUS.

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:35.137
WHY YOU THINK THE STATE SHOULD

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:37.005
MANDATE RATHER THAN ALLOWING --

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:39.107
BUSINESSES TO IMPLEMENT THAT

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:39.708
THEMSELVES -- I THINK IT'S A

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:40.475
FAIR POINT.

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:43.212
WHILE WE'VE SEEN INTERESTING

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:45.347
ENOUGH ADOPTION AND A MORE LOCAL

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.282
SMALL BUSINESS LEVEL YOU REALLY

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.852
HAVEN'T SEEN ADOPTION.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:52.654
OF MUCH BROADER LEVEL SO -- IT'S

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.156
UNFORTUNATE THAT THE THE

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.924
COMPANIES OR THE ENTITIES WITH

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:58.360
FRANKLY THE MOST MEANS IN THE

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.161
**** AND THE FACTS ABILITY TO

01:14:59.228 --> 01:14:59.361
THIS.

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:00.362
NEW THEORY WITH THE MOST

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:02.097
SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY --

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.533
REALLY HAVEN'T DONE IN MY

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.770
OPINION THEIR PART TO REALLY

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:10.772
MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION.

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:11.373
OKAY THAT THAT'S A FAIR ENOUGH

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.609
POINT -- I WILL JUST SAY THAT.

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:16.178
FOR ME AS A CONSUMER I WANT -- I

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.779
JUST WOULD PREFER THAT WE ALLOW

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:19.548
BUSINESSES TO MAKE THIS DECISION

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:20.449
WHETHER THAT'S GOOD FOR THEIR

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:21.683
COMPANY'S BOTTOM LINE OR THAT

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.685
SOMETHING THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS

01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:24.920
ARE CALLING FOR I THINK WE

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:25.587
SHOULD LET THEM MAKE THOSE

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:26.655
DECISIONS.

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.190
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.524
YOU ON THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW

01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:31.660
SIX FOOT LONG RECEIPT IS KIND OF

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:33.729
RIDICULOUS BUT BUT I KNOW THAT

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.430
THIS BILL IS ALSO GOING TO THE

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:38.567
PRIVACY COMMITTEE WHICH IS

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:39.701
PROBABLY WERE MORE OF MY

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:40.936
CONCERNS ARE.

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:42.170
JUST IN THAT I'M THINKING OF

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:43.805
CERTAIN FAMILY MEMBERS OF MINE

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:45.340
WHO WOULD HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY.

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:48.410
IN -- GETTING A RECEIPT LIKE

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:49.978
THIS ELECTRONICALLY OR EVEN

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:51.613
BEING ABLE TO FIND IT NOT TO

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.881
MENTION THOSE WHO ARE

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:54.516
CATEGORIZING THE RECEIPTS FOR

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:57.719
TAX PURPOSES -- I MEAN THERE'S

01:15:57.786 --> 01:15:59.221
PLENTY OF APPS AND AND SOFTWARE

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:00.889
NOW TO DO THAT FOR US BUT NOT

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:02.024
EVERYONE IS.

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.692
IS LIKE US YOU KNOW WITH THE YOU

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:04.726

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.662
FUNDS AT OUR COMPUTERS VERY

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:09.031
QUICKLY SO -- SO FOR THAT REASON

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:10.832
THOUGH I'M WITH YA ON THAT YOU

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.701

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:14.236
TREES ARE IT IS YOUR PAPERS

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:16.805
RENEWABLE SOURCE -- WE WANT TO

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:20.475
THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT I'M WITH

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:22.577
YOU ON GETTING ON THE WAYS BUT

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:24.079
I'M FORCE I CAN'T BE WITH YOU IN

THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU THANK

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:24.880

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:27.449

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.617
MEMBERS FRIENDS WHO WANT

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:29.952
RECEIPTS FOR TAX PURPOSES OF

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.286
SPECIFIC REASONS.

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:33.689
OBVIOUSLY DOT THAT'S WHAT'S

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:34.723
ABSOLUTELY ALLOWABLE.

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.124
WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS YOUR IN

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:37.392
THE COFFEE SHOP IN THE RECEIPT

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:38.694
GETS PRINTED YOU YOU HAVE NO NO

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.162
NEED FOR THAT?

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:41.630
THE RECEIPT IN THE COFFEE SHOP

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:42.831
COULD NOT RETURN THE COFFEE --

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.399
SO AGAIN IN THOSE KINDS OF

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:46.201
CIRCUMSTANCES WE'RE TRYING TO

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.036
FIGURE OUT OKAY DO WE CAN WE CAN

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:50.739
WE REALLY -- NOT HAVE THAT PAPER

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:52.174
WASTE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN I'VE

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.943
BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE AS MY

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.211
COLLEGES DOCTORS THAT YOU SAY NO

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:57.446
RECEIPTS BUT WHAT THEY DO IS

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.014
THEY PUT THE RECEIPT OUT NO

01:16:59.081 --> 01:16:59.781
RECEIPT OKAY THEY TAKE IN THE

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:00.415
THIRD WAY.

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:02.551
SO AGAIN -- WE'RE REALLY TRYING

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:09.191
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE MUCH

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:10.492
MORE MONEY.

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:11.460
SAYS AND I'M.

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:13.061
MY CONCERN IS THAT I NOW IT'S

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:14.162
OPTIONAL.

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.763
IN MAYBE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:15.397
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL ANYMORE THAN

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.999
WE SEE THE BILL THAT SAYS OKAY

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:17.599
NOW IT'S MANDATORY AND THAT.

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:18.233
IS CAN WHEN WE SEE THAT HAPPEN

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.067
ALL THE TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:20.168
WE START OFF WITH THE GOOD IDEA

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:21.803
WITH GREAT INTENTIONS AND THEN

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:22.971
WE SEE IT MORPH INTO SOMETHING

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:24.172
ELSE DOWN THE ROAD NOT SAYING

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:26.375
THAT THAT YOUR INTENTION -- BUT

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:28.910

ON THAT LEGISLATIVE TRIP AND

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:40.602
I'LL TELL YOU IT WAS SO.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.671
EMOTIONALLY AFFECTING TO SEE THE

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:45.140

WERE PARTICULARLY POIGNANT

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:50.912

IN TOWN BEING DESTROYED. ONE OF

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:01.022
THE THINGS THAT WAS AMAZING

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:01.623
ABOUT THAT FIRE IS THAT THE

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:02.390
BEHAVIOR OF THE FIRE WAS NOTHING

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:03.391
LIKE.

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:05.060
WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN CALIFORNIA

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.361
IF YOU READ SOME OF THE CAL FIRE

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:08.196
REPORTS THEY COMPARE THE SPREAD

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:10.565
OF THAT FIRE. TO THE FIRE

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:14.102
BOMBING OF HAMBURG IN WORLD WAR

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:15.704
TWO IT WAS NOT LIKE A WILDFIRE.

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:18.607
IN IN BEHAVIOR AT ALL IN FACT

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:19.241
THE MAJORITY OF THE STRUCTURES

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:20.008

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:25.714

COST OF TRANSPORTING BIOMASS

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.507

WHICH WAS.

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:17.211
VERY HELPFUL I DO THINK WE STILL

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:19.147
HAVE A FEW CONCERNS JUST ABOUT

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:20.815

PRACTICE THIS KIND.

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:42.403
OF REDUCTION IN THAT COST FOR

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:44.372

GREATEST DISADVANTAGES THAT BIO

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:14.168
MASS FACES COMPARED TO WIND OR

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:16.437
SOLAR IS THE THE TRANSPORTATION

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:18.172
OF ACTUAL FUEL ITSELF AND THAT'S

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:19.874
THE PURPOSE OF AB THREE FORTY

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:20.942
THREE AND WHY WE THINK IT IS SO

01:31:21.008 --> 01:31:21.542
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS BILL

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:22.476
PASSED TODAY.

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:23.778

PRECLUSION OF BIOMASS FACILITIES

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:34.188
WHO HAVE CONTRACTS UNDER SB NINE

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:36.357

LOCATED IN NON ATTAINMENT AREAS.

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:41.929
CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS TWENTY

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:44.365
THREE BIOMASS FACILITIES IN

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:45.499
THEIR TOTALITY. SEVEN OF WHICH

01:31:45.566 --> 01:31:47.335
HAVE BIRAM CONTRACTS SO IF YOU

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:49.170
SUBTRACTED SEVEN FROM TWENTY

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:50.238
THREE IN.

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:50.872
I'M NOT A MATH MAJOR BUT I THINK

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:52.807
AT SIXTEEN AND THEN IF YOU THERE

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:54.208

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:55.409
THAT ARE NON ATTAINMENT

01:31:55.476 --> 01:31:56.777
SUBTRACTED THAT THEN.

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:57.879
YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT TWELVE

01:31:57.945 --> 01:32:00.014
FACILITIES AND THEN PRESUMABLY

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:01.215
SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONLY

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:02.817
SMALL DIAMETER MORE MATERIAL

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.518
HAVING TO DO WITH FOREST WE'RE

01:32:04.585 --> 01:32:06.787
NOT INCLUDING AG FACILITY SO.

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.656
I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY LEFT

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:10.691
FACILITIES ARE LEFT ELIGIBLE FOR

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:11.993
THIS MONEY UNDER THIS BILL IN

01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:14.462
PARTICULAR AND THAT IS A CONCERN

01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:16.564
THAT I HAVE -- WE WANT TO BE

ABLE TO MAKE THIS SOMETHING THAT

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:19.467
WE CAN REDUCE THE COST OF

01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:20.434
TRANSPORTATION AND THAT

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:22.136
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WE

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.704
ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:25.339
SPECIFY WHAT SMALL DIAMETER

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:26.841
MATERIAL IS I'M NOT SURE WHAT

01:32:26.908 --> 01:32:29.543
THAT IS -- WE CURRENTLY DON'T

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:30.978
HAVE.

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.813
NOR WOULD WE EVER WANT TO TAKE --

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.715
LARGE DIAMETER TREES THAT

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:36.417
WEREN'T ALREADY DEAD AND TAKEN

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:37.952
TO A BIOMASS FACILITY BECAUSE

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:38.853
THERE'S A HIGHER AND USE FOR

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:39.553
THOSE.

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.455
MATERIALS HOWEVER WE WANT TO

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:43.257
MAKE SURE THAT IT ISN'T INTENDED

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:44.759
TO MEAN THAT SLASH FROM A LARGER

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:46.727
DIAMETER TREE COULDN'T BE TAKEN

01:32:46.794 --> 01:32:48.462
TO A BIO MASS FACILITY -- I

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:49.830
THINK OUT OF FORCE WE'RE GONNA

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:50.298
HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:54.402
ASCERTAINING THAT ONE LOT OF

01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:55.836
THREE SLASH CAME FROM AN

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:58.005
EIGHTEEN INCH DIAMETER TREE AND

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.307
IN ANOTHER SECTION OF THE FORCE

01:32:59.373 --> 01:33:00.942
THAT ONE CAME FROM THIRTY SIX WE

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:01.909
HAVE TO KEEP THE SEPARATE THAT'S

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:03.210
JUST NOT THE WAY THAT WORKS.

01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:04.745
OUT IN THE FOREST SAID THOSE ARE

01:33:04.812 --> 01:33:08.649
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:09.951
AMENDMENTS THANK YOU.

01:33:10.017 --> 01:33:11.819
THANKS VERY MUCH DOCTOR.

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:12.987
LOW IN NAME IS STEVE KAFKA I'M

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:13.554
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:14.355
SCIENCES AT UC DAVIS AND

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:15.856
DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:17.591
BIOMASS COLLABORATIVE.

01:33:17.658 --> 01:33:19.126
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT OF MANY

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:20.494
PARTS ARE FOR CERTAIN DIRE

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:21.963
CONDITION TERMS OF NUMBERS OF

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:24.065
DEAD TREES BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF

01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:25.666
OVERCROWDING HAVE CANOPY.

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:26.801
OF STRUCTURES THAT LEAD TO

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:28.769
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES MANY

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:30.571
PARTS OF OUR FORESTS.

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:31.706
WE ALSO KNOW THE NUMBER OF

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:32.940
DEVASTATING WILDFIRES ARE

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:34.942
INCREASING AND I'M ACTUALLY

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:36.477
MYSELF PERSONALLY VERY CONCERNED

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:38.379
THAT WE COULD SEE CONFLAGRATIONS

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:40.581
IN THE FUTURE THAT EVEN FOUR

01:33:40.648 --> 01:33:41.716
FOOT WHICH ASSAULT LAST SUMMER.

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:42.883
WITH SO MANY DEAD TREES IN

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:43.484
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE SIERRA

01:33:43.551 --> 01:33:46.487
NEVADA PARTICULARLY IN OTHER

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.356
PARTS OF THE STATE'S FORCE THAT --

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:48.990
AND IF CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT IT

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:49.924
COULD BE JUST EXTRAORDINARILY

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:51.892
BAD.

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.527
WE ALSO I THINK ALL AGREE THAT

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:55.396
HEALTHY FORESTS ARE AN

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:56.764
UNAMBIGUOUS PUBLIC GOOD.

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:59.033
SO HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THAT GIVEN

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.535
THE GIVE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS --

01:34:01.602 --> 01:34:03.170
THAT WE FACE THE HEALTHY FOREST

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:04.171
CONNECTED.

01:34:04.238 --> 01:34:05.439
CONNECTORS CARBON SINKS NAY DO

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:06.474
ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.042
CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S FORCE ARE

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:09.076
SHIFTING OVER TO COURT AND

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.578
SOURCES IN THIS UNDERMINES THE

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:12.246
STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND VERY

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:13.247
SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:16.317
VERY HARD EARNED AN HARD WON

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:19.420
CLIMATE GAINES.

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:20.821
THE PRUDENT USE IN FACT WE'VE

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:22.656
SEEN WE SING RECOGNITION THIS

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:24.358
THE RECENT GOVERNOR'S UP A

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:25.693
PROPOSAL.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.894
TO DEVELOPERS A STATE OF

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:29.764
EMERGENCY AHEAD OF THE FORCE FOR

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:31.132
SEASON TO FACILITATE.

01:34:31.198 --> 01:34:33.667
SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ACTIONS

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:34.301
AT THIS BILL WOULD FACILITATE AS

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:34.769
WELL.

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.937
WE KNOW THAT THE PRUDENT USE OF

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:38.205
FORCE BY MASS CAN LEAD.

01:34:38.272 --> 01:34:39.240
TO ALL KINDS OF NEW PRODUCTS

01:34:39.306 --> 01:34:41.575
TRANSPORTATION FUELS BIOPRODUCTS

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:43.344
AND ENERGY PRODUCTION.

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:44.512
WE KNOW THAT WILL REDUCE

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:46.047
POLLUTION AND HEALTH COSTS AND

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:47.048
LOSS OF LIFE.

01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:48.282
WE KNOW THAT WILL HELP CREATE

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:50.084
NEW JOBS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:51.452
AREAS AND AMONG DISADVANTAGED

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:53.287
COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO THE SOURCES

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:54.288
OF THESE BIOMASS.

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:56.557
AND IT'LL HELP OFFSET THE COSTS

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:59.193
OF CREATING RECREATING HEALTHY

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.528
FORCE IN THE STATE.

01:35:00.594 --> 01:35:01.595
THERE MANY FORMS OF BIOMASS

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:03.197
AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:05.533
A THIRD POSSIBLY -- ACCESSIBLE

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:07.134
FROM URBAN SOURCES IN RESIDUALS

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:09.870
THIRD FROM AGRICULTURAL SOURCES

01:35:09.937 --> 01:35:11.005
NO THIRD FROM FORESTRY.

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:13.274
BY AND LARGE THE MOST EXPENSIVE

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:14.875
SOURCES OF BIOMASS OR FROM

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:16.343
FORESTRY.

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:17.711
SO TRIPS AND TRANSPORTATION

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:19.346
COSTS OR MAJOR REASON THAT --

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:22.183
FORESTRY BIOMASS IS AMONG THE

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:23.317
MOST EXPENSIVE SOURCES.

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:24.652
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:26.454
SUBSIDY PROGRAM TO FACILITATE

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.988
THE USE OF THIS BIOMASS TO

01:35:28.055 --> 01:35:30.357
ACHIEVE THE MANY POSITIVE

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:30.991
BENEFITS THAT CAN COME FROM ITS

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:31.725
USE.

01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:33.861
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES IN

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:35.229
THE LAST MINUTE BUT I HAVE.

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:36.630
A COMPANY CALLED SWEET WATER

01:35:36.697 --> 01:35:38.399
ENERGY FOR EXAMPLE A CALIFORNIA

01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:40.401
BASED TECHNOLOGY COMPANY HAS THE

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:42.036
ABILITY TO TAKE WOODY BIOMASS

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:44.004
NOW AND CONVERTED INTO SIMPLE

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:45.473
SUGARS.

01:35:45.539 --> 01:35:47.374
CLEAN LIGNIN AND DUST REAL

01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:49.143
ALCOHOLS THEIR BUILDING

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:50.478
INTERESTING NEW PROJECTS WHERE

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.146
MINNESOTA.

01:35:52.213 --> 01:35:53.614
NEW YORK IN ESTONIA NOT

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:55.783
CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA IS AN

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:57.651
EXPENSIVE PLACE TO TO ACHIEVE

01:35:57.718 --> 01:35:59.153
THESE TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED TO

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.254
MAKE A CONDITION WHERE WE CAN

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:01.922
SEE THESE INNOVATIVE

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:03.224
TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP.

01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:04.925
CARBON NANOFIBERS CAN BE ADDED

01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:06.227
TO CONCRETE WHAT DOES THAT DO

01:36:06.293 --> 01:36:07.328
THAT REDUCES THE ABOUT A

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:08.562
CONCRETE YOU NEED IN A

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:10.931
PERMANENTLY REDUCES MOVES CARBON

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:12.800
FROM THE ATMOSPHERE.

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:13.601
AS A POSITIVE MY PROFILE

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:15.236
PRODUCTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT CAN BE

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:16.704
MADE FROM FORCED BY A MESS.

01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:17.738
AND LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

01:36:17.805 --> 01:36:19.073
FROM ONE CALIFORNIA COMPANY

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.241
THAT'S ABOUT READY TO BREAK

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:21.775
GROUND ON A NEW FACILITY THAT

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:23.611
WILL CONVERT WOULD INTO

01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:24.612
TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN THIS

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:25.946
CASE ETHANOL.

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:27.014
THAT'S A MEDICINE.

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:29.049
THEY COULD AS EASILY USE ORCHARD

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.217
WOOD FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:31.185
WHICH WILL REDUCE THE BURNING

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:32.786
PROBLEM BUT THEY COULD ALSO USE

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.021
SOFT WHICH SMITH FROM THE STAIRS

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:35.756
BUT TRANSPORTATION COSTS IN

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:38.225
THOSE CASES OR SIGNIFICANT

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:39.660
BARRIERS TO THE USE OF THAT.

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:42.329
SO I WOULD SUPPORT.

01:36:42.396 --> 01:36:45.933
THE PASSAGE OF AB OF THREE FORTY

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.067
THREE BECAUSE IT SOME MEASURE IT

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:49.036
WILL HELP REDUCE THE TO START ON

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:50.471
HELPING TO DIVERT TO ADDRESS

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:51.839

01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:52.673
PROBLEMS.

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:53.941
AND IT SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE

01:36:54.008 --> 01:36:56.143
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BUSINESSES IN

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:57.478
CALIFORNIA AND JOBS.

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:58.579
WHICH ARE.

01:36:58.646 --> 01:36:59.980
A WAY OF HELPING REDUCE SOME OF

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:01.048
THE EXPENSIVE COSTS OF OUR

FIRE WOULD BE A NATURAL

01:47:04.885 --> 01:47:06.486
OCCURRENCE NOT A CATASTROPHE.

01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:07.721
AND THAT REQUIRES CERTAIN TYPES

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:09.122
OF RESTORATION ACTIVITIES

01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:10.223
STANDING AND THAT'S THE

01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:11.825
LEGISLATURE TAKEN A LOT OF STEPS

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:12.859

PLAN OF A HALF MILLION ACRES OF

01:47:19.299 --> 01:47:20.801
FOREST ACTIVITIES DOESN'T

01:47:20.867 --> 01:47:21.701
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE

01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:23.837

WE'VE FOCUSED ON ONE OFF BANDS.

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:47.640
OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO TRY TO

A MOLE.

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:50.910
HOWEVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:52.912

LESS THAN 9% THE PLASTIC IS

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:07.927
RECYCLED AND THAT PERCENTAGE IS

01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:09.129
DROPPING SINCE THE INTERNATIONAL

THE TRAGIC IMPACTS OF PLASTIC

01:53:26.933 --> 01:53:28.668

I SEE TURTLES WITH THE WITH THE

STRAWS UP THEIR NOSE IN ALL THE

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:39.779

01:53:41.414 --> 01:53:43.016
THE PLASTIC PRODUCED A PLASTIC --

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:44.517
PRODUCTION PRODUCTION AND

01:53:44.584 --> 01:53:45.919

VARMINT.

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:49.689
AND THE WILDLIFE EFFECTS -- IT'S

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:51.691
VERY REAL AND DEVASTATING.

01:53:51.758 --> 01:53:53.560

REASONS TO WHY THIS BILL IS

01:53:58.965 --> 01:53:59.666
NECESSARY.

01:53:59.732 --> 01:54:02.101
SPECIFICALLY PLASTIC PRODUCTION.

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:03.336
FACILITIES ARE TYPICALLY

01:54:03.403 --> 01:54:05.171
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED AT THE

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:06.139
SOURCE OF OIL PRODUCTION AND ARE

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:07.907
LOCATED ALONGSIDE REFINERIESIN

01:54:07.974 --> 01:54:08.841
THE MOST DISADVANTAGED

AND ON THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING

01:54:13.179 --> 01:54:14.614
ON NEARBYCOMMUNITIES.

01:54:14.681 --> 01:54:15.915
ADDITIONALLY ONE PLASTIC WASTE

01:54:15.982 --> 01:54:17.517
IS EXPORTED TO OTHER COUNTRIES

01:54:17.584 --> 01:54:19.118
THE EXES THAT CAN'T BE PROPERLY

01:54:19.185 --> 01:54:20.587
MANAGE ALMOST ALWAYS ENDS UP

01:54:20.653 --> 01:54:22.088
BEING DUMPED IN OR NEAR THE

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:23.456
POOREST COMMUNITIES.

01:54:23.523 --> 01:54:24.857
AND EXACERBATE TO CYCLE OF

WE SUPPORT THIS APPROACH BECAUSE

01:55:47.807 --> 01:55:49.275
IT FOCUSES ON THE FRONT AND ON

01:55:49.342 --> 01:55:50.576
THE SOURCE REDUCTION RATHER THAN

01:55:50.643 --> 01:55:51.944
DEALING WITH THE WASTE AFTER

IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME

02:04:29.829 --> 02:04:30.896
CLARITY AND UNDERSTANDING OF

02:04:30.963 --> 02:04:32.464
WHAT ALL THIS MEANS THAT'S AN

02:04:32.531 --> 02:04:35.234
IMPORTANT POINT I THINK NEEDS TO

BE CONSIDERED AS THIS BILL MOVES

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:36.869

02:04:46.111 --> 02:04:47.379
NECESSARY.

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:48.747
THIS IS A SWEEPING DELEGATION OF

02:04:48.814 --> 02:04:50.783
AUTHORITY TO CAL RECYCLE WE

02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:51.784
THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME

02:04:51.851 --> 02:04:54.153
OVERSIGHT AND RULE BY THE ROLE

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:55.688

PRACTICAL TIME LINES.

02:04:57.256 --> 02:04:59.291
IN OUR VIEW.

02:04:59.358 --> 02:05:00.926
ARE NECESSARY RIGHT NOW THE BILL

BE DETERMINED BY.

02:05:08.567 --> 02:05:09.268
TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE DON'T THINK

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.769
THAT'S AN ACHIEVABLE GOAL

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.438

02:05:20.412 --> 02:05:22.281
NECESSARY.

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:23.949
DEVELOPING DOMESTIC MARKETS FOR

02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:25.284
MATERIAL THAT ONCE PREVIOUSLY

02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:26.485
WAS EXPORTED CHINA.

02:05:26.552 --> 02:05:29.655
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:31.123
IT'S UNCLEAR ON THE TOPIC OF

02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:33.325
SOURCE REDUCTION IT'S UNCLEAR TO

02:05:33.392 --> 02:05:34.960
US WHAT EXACTLY.

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:36.495
THAT MEANS AND HOW RESPONSIBLE

02:05:36.562 --> 02:05:38.597
ENTITIES WOULD COMPLY PACKAGING

02:05:38.664 --> 02:05:40.933
SERVES A NECESSARY PURPOSE TO

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.002

FEASIBLE OR MAY NOT EVEN BE.

02:05:53.012 --> 02:05:55.080

02:05:55.147 --> 02:05:55.714
CONFLICT WITH WITH STATE FEDERAL

02:05:55.781 --> 02:05:57.616
LAW.

02:05:57.683 --> 02:05:59.118
THE FINAL POINT I MAKE IS THAT

02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:00.653
THE STATE CURRENTLY OPERATES HAS

02:06:00.719 --> 02:06:01.720
BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE THE

02:06:01.787 --> 02:06:02.888
EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES.

02:06:02.955 --> 02:06:04.890

MANY COMPANIES ARE COMPLYING

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:16.835
WITH THAT HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO

02:06:22.308 --> 02:06:24.677
IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THIS LAW THE

EXISTING LAW.

NOT GONNA WORK BANDS AND OTHER

02:10:49.641 --> 02:10:51.043

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:52.177
THAT'S LEFT TO US.

02:10:52.244 --> 02:10:53.879

HOW WE MANAGE THE RECYCLING.

02:11:21.974 --> 02:11:24.676
AND WHEN WE FOCUS ON TO THAT END

02:11:24.743 --> 02:11:26.578
BUT WE CAN'T FORGET THE WE'VE

02:11:26.645 --> 02:11:27.546
ALWAYS HEARD THIS AS WE WERE

02:11:27.613 --> 02:11:29.815
GROWING UP REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE

02:11:29.881 --> 02:11:31.316

02:11:36.388 --> 02:11:37.522
NOT WORKING.

02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:38.991
SO WE HAVE TO REDUCE WHAT WE USE

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:40.158

CREATED OUR ENVIRONMENT IS A

02:12:21.566 --> 02:12:23.969
LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING WHEN A

02:12:24.036 --> 02:12:24.836
BETTER SOLUTION WOULD BE TO

IN ORDER TO COMBAT SEA LEVEL

02:17:14.392 --> 02:17:16.728
RISE AS THIS BODY WELL KNOWS

02:17:16.795 --> 02:17:18.196
CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE

02:17:18.263 --> 02:17:19.297
FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE

02:17:19.364 --> 02:17:20.932
CONFRONTING OUR GENERATION.

02:17:20.999 --> 02:17:22.434
AS OUR STATE CONTINUES TO LEAD

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.502
ON COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND

02:17:24.569 --> 02:17:25.537
WE WORK TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:27.339
GOALS WE ALSO MUST SAFEGUARD

02:17:27.405 --> 02:17:29.140
CALIFORNIA DEVELOPING STRATEGIES

02:17:29.207 --> 02:17:30.809
TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:17:30.875 --> 02:17:34.980
AND STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THEN

02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:36.915
ON OUR COAST THE CALIFORNIA

02:17:36.982 --> 02:17:38.583
COAST IS EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY

02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:40.719
MILES OF BREATHTAKING BEAUTY.

02:17:40.785 --> 02:17:43.788
HOME TO NEARLY 70% OF

02:17:43.855 --> 02:17:47.158
CALIFORNIANS AND CRITICAL ENGINE

02:17:47.225 --> 02:17:48.526
OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY.

02:17:48.593 --> 02:17:49.828
BUT THAT'S ALL UNDER THREAT FROM

02:17:49.894 --> 02:17:51.262
SEA LEVEL RISE SEA LEVELS ARE

02:17:51.329 --> 02:17:53.531
PROJECTED TO RISE BY FIVE FEET

02:17:53.598 --> 02:17:55.300
BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY AND

02:17:55.367 --> 02:17:57.102
IF WE DO NOT ACT CALIFORNIA WILL

02:17:57.168 --> 02:17:58.303
LOSE MORE THAN HALF OF OUR

02:17:58.370 --> 02:17:59.804
COASTAL HABITAT TO SEA LEVEL

02:17:59.871 --> 02:18:00.705
RISE.

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:02.040
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND BILLIONS

02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:04.476
OF DOLLARS ARE DIRECTLY AT RISK

02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:06.011
UNLESS WE ACT NOW.

02:18:06.077 --> 02:18:07.779
AND OUR BEST DEFENSE IS NATURE

02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:09.381
ITSELF OUR COASTLINES ARE AMONG

02:18:09.447 --> 02:18:11.349
THE MOST DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS ON

02:18:11.416 --> 02:18:11.983
EARTH.

02:18:12.050 --> 02:18:13.251
THEY'RE CONSTANTLY SHAPED BY

WAVES WINDS TIDES AND STORMS

02:18:15.854 --> 02:18:18.056
NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS THRIVE ADMITS

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:19.524
THIS CHANGE AND HAVE INDEED

02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:21.426
DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO SHAPE

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:22.594
THAT CHANGE.

02:18:22.661 --> 02:18:24.129
SOME EXAMPLES OF NATURAL OR

CAN REDUCE FLOODING AERATION.

02:18:36.074 --> 02:18:37.075
AND NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE

02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:38.643
DOESN'T JUST COMBAT SEA LEVEL

02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:40.278
RISE THIS APPROACH CREATES

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:41.780
COASTAL HABITATS THAT ARE

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:42.881
IMPORTANT FOR CARBON

ADDITIONALLY ACCORDINGTO THE

02:18:47.919 --> 02:18:50.121
EPA GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO

02:18:50.188 --> 02:18:52.824
COSTS LESS THAN CONVENTIONAL

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:54.626
GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE MAKING THIS

02:18:54.693 --> 02:18:55.960
A COST EFFICIENT.

02:18:56.027 --> 02:19:00.565
RESILIENT APPROACH TO COASTAL

REMAIN OPPOSED TO IT FOR SEVERAL

02:34:48.112 --> 02:34:50.914
REASONS -- FIRST -- BASICALLY IT

02:34:50.981 --> 02:34:52.683
SEEKS TO NEARLY DOUBLE THE TIRE

02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:53.651

SUPPORTERS -- THERE MANY METALS

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:02.459
THE FALL IN THE WATER YET WE'RE

02:35:02.526 --> 02:35:04.028
IDENTIFYING ZINC AS ONE THE

02:35:04.094 --> 02:35:05.696
AUTHORS ALSO STATED THAT IS

02:35:05.763 --> 02:35:07.297
CAUSED BY TIRES.

02:35:07.364 --> 02:35:09.266
IN BY MOST OF THE STUDIES THAT

02:35:09.333 --> 02:35:10.134
HAVE BEEN DONE THROUGHOUT THE

02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:13.070
WORLD TIRES ARE ACTUALLY BUT ONE

02:35:13.137 --> 02:35:14.038
ELEMENT THAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTING

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:14.705
TO IT.

02:35:14.772 --> 02:35:16.607
THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF ZINC SEEMS

02:35:16.674 --> 02:35:18.275
TO BE GALVANIZED METAL BUT IT'S

02:35:18.342 --> 02:35:20.244
ALSO A NATURALLY.

02:35:20.310 --> 02:35:20.811
OCCURRING SUBSTANCE IN THE

02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:23.847
ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS USED IN --

02:35:23.914 --> 02:35:27.518
INDUSTRIAL USE.

02:35:27.584 --> 02:35:30.721
SECONDLY -- YEAH THE COST -- AND

02:35:30.788 --> 02:35:31.321
GOT TO MENTION THIS TO BE IN

02:35:31.388 --> 02:35:33.257
EXCESS OF TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS

02:35:33.323 --> 02:35:33.791
TO ADDRESS IT IN SOUTHERN

CALIFORNIA.

02:35:35.059 --> 02:35:38.696
RAISING THE TIRE FEE DOLLAR --

02:35:38.762 --> 02:35:39.296
FIFTY FOR THE ROUGHLY THIRTY

02:35:39.363 --> 02:35:41.265
MILLION TIRES ARE SOLD ANNUALLY

02:35:41.331 --> 02:35:43.200
IS A BUT A DROP IN THE BUCKET IS

02:35:43.267 --> 02:35:44.768
NOT GOING TO GET THERE TO

02:35:44.835 --> 02:35:47.905
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- THIRDLY

02:35:47.971 --> 02:35:49.139
I'D SAY.

02:35:49.206 --> 02:35:50.240
TIRES ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE

02:35:50.307 --> 02:35:52.609
SOURCE THE PROBLEM IN FACT MAY

02:35:52.676 --> 02:35:53.711
BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.

02:35:53.777 --> 02:35:55.679
AND CURRENTLY CAL RECYCLES

02:35:55.746 --> 02:35:57.181
ACTUALLY STUDYING THIS LOOKING

02:35:57.247 --> 02:35:59.650
AT LEACHING FROM -- GROUND TIRE

02:35:59.717 --> 02:36:00.284
RUBBER SEE IF IT ACTUALLY IS AN

02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:02.419
ISSUE -- THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING

02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:03.921
THE STUDY THIS YEAR THEY SHOULD

02:36:03.987 --> 02:36:05.823
BE ALLOWED TO FINISH ALSO

02:36:05.889 --> 02:36:07.191
THEY'VE ACTUALLY FUNDED STUDIES

02:36:07.257 --> 02:36:08.959
IN ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED GROUND

02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:10.994
TIRES AS A WAY TO REDUCE HEAVY

02:36:11.061 --> 02:36:12.730
METALS FROM GOING INTO THE STORM

02:36:12.796 --> 02:36:13.630
RUNOFF.

02:36:13.697 --> 02:36:15.199
THEY ANISHA RESULTS ON THAT ARE

02:36:15.265 --> 02:36:17.201
VERY VERY POSITIVE SAID THIS MAY

02:36:17.267 --> 02:36:18.669
ACTUALLY PART OF THE SOLUTION

02:36:18.736 --> 02:36:20.604
NOT NECESSARILY THE PROBLEM.

02:36:20.671 --> 02:36:22.439
AND FINALLY I'D LIKE TO SAY -- I

02:36:22.506 --> 02:36:24.441
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW

02:36:24.508 --> 02:36:25.943
THIS IS PRIMARILY A SOUTHERN

02:36:26.009 --> 02:36:27.578
CALIFORNIA ISSUE YET THE

02:36:27.644 --> 02:36:29.246
SOLUTION IS TO TAX EVERYBODY IN

02:36:29.313 --> 02:36:31.582
THE STATE -- IF THIS WAS AN

02:36:31.648 --> 02:36:33.717
ISSUE FOR THIS FOR THE ENTIRE

02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:36.320

02:41:05.222 --> 02:41:06.823
A DE MINIMUS FEET.

02:41:06.890 --> 02:41:09.493
A DOLLAR FIFTY PER TIRE -- AND

02:41:09.559 --> 02:41:10.861
TYPICALLY FOLKS REPLACE THEIR

CONSUMER.

02:41:22.005 --> 02:41:23.507
THERE'S BEEN -- QUESTION AS TO

02:41:23.573 --> 02:41:25.042
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A WAY TO

02:41:25.108 --> 02:41:27.844
DIRECT THIS TO THE MANUFACTURER --

02:41:27.911 --> 02:41:29.379
FRANKLY I WISH THERE WERE

02:41:29.446 --> 02:41:30.547

ROADWAYS AND IS WASHED INTO THE

02:41:35.685 --> 02:41:37.754
STORM WATER SYSTEM -- BUT RIGHT

BURN PILES OR SOME OTHER

03:16:27.108 --> 03:16:30.912

ATTEMPT HERE BUT TO FOR US TO BE

03:16:53.835 --> 03:16:55.270
PIECE MEALING OUT G. G. R. F.

03:16:55.336 --> 03:16:56.971
WITHOUT A BROADER PLAN I THINK

03:16:57.038 --> 03:16:58.940
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SUB THREE

03:16:59.007 --> 03:16:59.941
NEEDS TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK

03:17:00.008 --> 03:17:02.143
AT AND THAT.

03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:03.011
I WOULD.

03:17:03.077 --> 03:17:04.045
KEEP WANTING TO COME BACK AND

03:17:04.112 --> 03:17:05.146
MAKE SURE THAT THE ASSEMBLY

03:17:05.213 --> 03:17:07.482
LOOKS BROADLY AT HOW WE'RE GOING

03:17:07.549 --> 03:17:08.783
TO BE SPENDING GIGI ARRIVE.

03:17:08.850 --> 03:17:10.652
COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR THAT SO

03:17:10.718 --> 03:17:11.953
THAT WE CAN PHILLIP CONSISTENTLY.

03:17:12.020 --> 03:17:14.355
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS INSTEAD OF

03:17:14.422 --> 03:17:16.324
THAT HAPHAZARD WAY THAT WE HAVE

03:17:16.391 --> 03:17:17.592
BEEN ADDRESSING IT SO I'M NOT

03:17:17.659 --> 03:17:18.826
GOING TO SUPPORT THAT IS AT THIS

03:17:18.893 --> 03:17:20.395
POINT IS I JUST.

03:17:20.461 --> 03:17:21.196
I THINK THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO

03:17:21.262 --> 03:17:22.730
GO ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS

03:17:22.797 --> 03:17:23.965
REDUCTION.

03:17:24.032 --> 03:17:26.401
FUNDS EXPENDITURES AND IN TRYING

03:17:26.467 --> 03:17:29.170
TO MANAGE THAT PROGRAM.

03:17:29.237 --> 03:17:30.438
THANK YOU AND I WOULD JUST LIKE

03:17:30.505 --> 03:17:31.839
TO COMMENT THAT I AGREE WITH YOU

03:17:31.906 --> 03:17:35.009
ABOUT THE ISSUE OF G. R. FUNDING --

03:17:35.076 --> 03:17:36.678
IN GENERAL ON THE AMENDMENTS TO

03:17:36.744 --> 03:17:38.546
REMOVE THE JUROR FUNDING PORTION

03:17:38.613 --> 03:17:41.316
FROM THE BILL SO NOW THE BILL

03:17:41.382 --> 03:17:44.752
DOES NOT EXPRESSLY -- USE YOUR

03:17:44.819 --> 03:17:46.020
RIGHT NOW I'M MORE OF THAT BUT

03:17:46.087 --> 03:17:47.589
THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY SOURCE

03:17:47.655 --> 03:17:49.524
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE VIABLE

03:17:49.591 --> 03:17:51.159
FOR SO IN THIS CASE WE HAVE A

03:17:51.226 --> 03:17:52.727
PROGRAM WITHOUT ANY FUNDING.

03:17:52.794 --> 03:17:54.429
AND WITHOUT NECESSARILY A

03:17:54.495 --> 03:17:56.097
MECHANISM TO TRY TO APPROACH

03:17:56.164 --> 03:17:57.465
THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S IT'S AN

03:17:57.532 --> 03:17:59.167
APPROPRIATE GENERAL FUND

03:17:59.234 --> 03:18:01.102
EXPENDITURE AGAIN CHOOSE YOUR

03:18:01.169 --> 03:18:02.737
OFFICE THAT THE LOGICAL PLACE

03:18:02.804 --> 03:18:04.906
FOR THIS TO GO WE SHOULD BE

03:18:04.973 --> 03:18:05.773
TALKING ABOUT THESE KINDS OF

03:18:05.840 --> 03:18:06.040
PROGRAMS.

03:18:06.107 --> 03:18:09.477
AND LOOKING AT ITEMS THAT ARE

03:18:09.544 --> 03:18:10.545
REDUCING.

03:18:10.612 --> 03:18:12.280
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SORT OF

03:18:12.347 --> 03:18:13.548
MORE BROADLY IN A MORE

03:18:13.615 --> 03:18:14.616

LIKE TO CLOSE ABSOLUTELY I THINK

03:18:22.257 --> 03:18:23.958
THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START

03:18:24.025 --> 03:18:25.793
GETTING RID OF BURN PILES --

03:18:25.860 --> 03:18:28.496
ACTUALLY USE THAT INSTEAD OF

03:18:28.563 --> 03:18:31.599
LOSING THAT ENERGY -- AND HAVING

03:18:31.666 --> 03:18:33.134
THE ADMITTANCE GOING TO THE YEAR

03:18:33.201 --> 03:18:35.103
WE CAN ACTUALLY HARNESS THAT IN

03:18:35.169 --> 03:18:37.705
MAKE IT INTO RENEWABLE ENERGY.

03:18:37.772 --> 03:18:40.508

DISASTERS DROUGHTS.

03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:41.336
SADLY IT'S OUR LOW INCOME

03:19:41.402 --> 03:19:42.937
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE.

03:19:43.004 --> 03:19:48.042
THAT ARE THE MOST AFFECTED.

03:19:48.109 --> 03:19:49.610
OUR LAST ROUTE RESULTED IN THE

03:19:49.677 --> 03:19:51.946
DISASTER IN ONE OF MY

03:19:52.013 --> 03:19:53.247
COMMUNITIES EAST PORTICO.

03:19:53.314 --> 03:19:54.549
AS MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE THE

03:19:54.615 --> 03:19:57.218
TOWN STILL HASN'T HAD RUNNING

03:19:57.285 --> 03:19:58.720
WATER IN FIVE YEARS.

03:19:58.786 --> 03:20:00.321
FAMILIES ARE STILL LEFT WITHOUT

03:20:00.388 --> 03:20:02.290
ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER

03:20:02.357 --> 03:20:04.659
RUNNING WATER IN GENERAL.

03:20:04.726 --> 03:20:07.095
WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN MANY STEPS.

03:20:07.161 --> 03:20:08.930
TO GET THE TOWN CONNECTED TO

03:20:08.996 --> 03:20:10.164
NEIGHBORING PORTABLES WATER

03:20:10.231 --> 03:20:11.899
SYSTEMS HOWEVER THE PROCESS IS

03:20:11.966 --> 03:20:13.668
SLOW.

03:20:13.735 --> 03:20:15.269
ALTHOUGH WE ARE NEARING THE

03:20:15.336 --> 03:20:16.771
POINT WHERE EAST PORTABLE CAN

03:20:16.838 --> 03:20:19.707
RETURN TO SOME SENSE OF NORMALCY.

03:20:19.774 --> 03:20:22.210
SMALL LOW INCOME TOWNS LIKE THIS

03:20:22.276 --> 03:20:23.578
ONE ARE SEVERELY.

03:20:23.644 --> 03:20:25.079
UNDER PREPARED FOR THE NEXT

03:20:25.146 --> 03:20:26.381
DROUGHT.

03:20:26.447 --> 03:20:28.116
WE MUST ALWAYS LOOK AHEAD.

03:20:28.182 --> 03:20:29.951
A WHAT MIGHT BE FALL OR

03:20:30.017 --> 03:20:31.352
DISADVANTAGE.

03:20:31.419 --> 03:20:34.722
AND AT RISK COMMUNITIES ONE WAY

03:20:34.789 --> 03:20:36.824
THAT WE CAN BETTER PREPARE. FOR

03:20:36.891 --> 03:20:38.326
THE DISASTERS AHEAD.

03:20:38.393 --> 03:20:39.160
AND EVEN TO MITIGATE THEIR

03:20:39.227 --> 03:20:40.928
DAMAGES.

03:20:40.995 --> 03:20:45.533
THIS FOUND WITHIN AB. TWO THIRTY

03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:46.000
ONE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE

03:20:46.067 --> 03:20:48.503
LEGISLATURE ADOPTED SB EIGHTY

03:20:48.569 --> 03:20:50.004
EIGHT WITHIN THE LANGUAGE THERE.

03:20:50.071 --> 03:20:51.739
WAS A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR

03:20:51.806 --> 03:20:54.642
RECYCLED WATER FACILITIES AND

03:20:54.709 --> 03:20:56.210
TERTIARY TREATMENT PLANTS.

03:20:56.277 --> 03:20:57.979
WHY THIS EXEMPTION WAS VASTLY

03:20:58.045 --> 03:20:59.814
NEEDED THE SHORT SUNSET DATE

03:20:59.881 --> 03:21:01.349
ALONG WITH THE SPECIFIC

03:21:01.416 --> 03:21:02.950
REFERENCE TO THE DROUGHT?

03:21:03.017 --> 03:21:04.218
STATE OF EMERGENCY HAMPERED

03:21:04.285 --> 03:21:07.088
EFFORTS TO UTILIZE THE EXEMPTION

03:21:07.155 --> 03:21:08.189
FOR THE EXPANSION OF THESE

03:21:08.256 --> 03:21:11.125
FACILITIES UNFORTUNATELY NO NEWS

03:21:11.192 --> 03:21:12.794
FACILITIES WERE ABLE.

03:21:12.860 --> 03:21:14.395
TO CAPITALIZE ON THE SEQUEL

03:21:14.462 --> 03:21:16.431
EXEMPTION BECAUSE OF THE SHORT

03:21:16.497 --> 03:21:17.765
TIME FRANK.

03:21:17.832 --> 03:21:19.267

03:21:19.333 --> 03:21:19.967
ANY FUTURE.

03:21:20.034 --> 03:21:21.702
DROUGHTS.

03:21:21.769 --> 03:21:24.138
WHICH IS SO SEVERE AS TO MERIT A

03:21:24.205 --> 03:21:26.441
DECLARATION OF OUR EMERGENCY BY

03:21:26.507 --> 03:21:28.443
THE GOVERNOR SHOULD RECEIVE THIS

03:21:28.509 --> 03:21:31.345
EXEMPTION.

03:21:31.412 --> 03:21:33.514
MEMBERS THIS IS VERY SIMPLE.
