THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OUR COUNTRY'S LIVING THROUGH A GUN VIOLENCE CRISIS OF EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS KILLED EVERY YEAR AND MANY MORE WOUNDED. OVER THE COURSE OF OUR LIFETIMES I BELIEVE EVERY AMERICAN WILL KNOW SOMEONE WHO LOSES THEIR LIFE TO GUN VIOLENCE. THIS IS UNIQUELY AMERICAN PHENOMENON AND THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THIS HAPPENING SO MUCH MORE IN AMERICA THAN EVER EVERY PLACE ELSE. WHY DOES VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER FIRST WORLD COUNTRY HAVE SO MUCH LESS GUN VIOLENCE IT'S PREPOSTEROUS TO THINK THAT ALL OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE. I THINK THE REASON IS OBVIOUS WE HAVE THE WEAKEST GUN CONTROL BILLS THE STRONGEST GUN LOBBY AND THE MOST PERVASIVE GUN CULTURE IN THE FIRST WORLD. IN TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA SOLVE TROUBLING RISE OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED HOMICIDES WHICH IS THE LARGEST JUMP IN THE STATE'S HISTORY SINCE RECORD KEEPING BEGAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY. SIMULTANEOUSLY THE STATE RECORDED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND HANDGUN TRANSACTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY. UP 65% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. GUN SHOWS ARE DEDICATED EVENTS TO DISPLAY AND SALE OF FIREARMS AND FIREARM RELATED ACCESSORIES THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ATTEND GUN SHOWS HELD EACH YEAR CONTRIBUTING TO A GROWING GUN CULTURE. THAT IS SO CLOSELY CORRELATED TO THE RISING GUN VIOLENCE WE ARE EXPERIENCING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE PROFITS EARNED BY GUN MANUFACTURERS HAVE AN RICH THEIR TOP EXECUTIVES AND FUNDED THE GROWTH OF THE OF THIS GUN CULTURE THAT IS SO UNIQUE TO THE UNITED STATES. WE DON'T NEED TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR OUT REACH BY MAKING LARGE PUBLIC VENUES AVAILABLE FOR GATHERINGS THAT ADVANCE A GUN CULTURE THAT ENRICHES THEM AND SHATTERS THE LIVES OF SO MANY. IT'S TIME TO END THE PRACTICE OF MAKING THESE GUNS AVAILABLE AT PUBLICLY OWNED SITES LIKE OUR FAIRGROUNDS THAT IN OUR COMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR. WHICH THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES. IS WHERE OUR COMMUNITY GOES FOR RECREATION FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FAIR GROUNDS ALL OF OUR USED ACTIVITIES MANY OF OUR YOUTH ACTIVITIES ARE CENTERED AROUND OUR FAIR GROUNDS. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE TAKES A SMALL FIRST STEP IN MY COMMUNITY THAT SEEKING TO PROHIBIT THE SALE OF FIREARMS AND FIREARM PICTURES OR PARTS OR AMMUNITION AT THE VENTURA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS AND TO TAKE A SMALL STEP TOWARDS ENDING THE GROWTH OF THE GUN CULTURE. WHEN I WAS READING A BEDTIME STORY TO OUR FIRST GRADER AND HE ASKED ME IF I COULD GET TO HIS CLASSROOM IN TIME TO PROTECT HIM OF A SHOOTER CAME ON CAMPUS. I HAVE TO TELL YOU I GULPED HARD THE MAJORITY OF THE PARENTS IN MY DISTRICT WANT TO DECREASE THE PRESENCE OF A GUN CULTURE IN OUR COMMUNITY THIS IS ONE STEP TO DO THAT. HERE WITH ME TODAY SPEAKING AT THE PORT OF THIS BILL IS FORMER VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISOR KATHY LONG WITH VENTURA COUNTY BRADY AND PIPER BENHAM FROM THE WOMEN FOR AMERICAN VALUES AND ETHICS THANK YOU VERY MUCH JR. THURMOND BEGAN WITH THE WITNESSES SUPPORT WITNESSES DUE TO WITNESSES FIVE MINUTES TOTAL. THEN THE REMAINING WILL BE SUPPORT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT I AM SPEAKING TODAY OF THE FORMER VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISOR TWENTY METERS A THIRTY FIVE YEAR RATHER THAN THAT BURKE COUNTY A MOTHER ADVOCATE WITHIN THEIR CUNNING GRADY. WE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS. ABOUT UNSPOKEN ARE OUT. OWN PROPER. WE. THANK IMPLEMENTED PARK REFLECT IS A VIRTUAL. WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATE AND THE FOUNDER OF. THAT ARE. UNFORTUNATELY WE RESIDENTS OF THE THIRD PARTY WORK BUT- THE FACT THAT IT. BARBARO BOB HERTZBERG ON BLACK COMMITTEE CLUSTER ARE YOU HAVE A POP YOU BREAKING UP CAN YOU. IT CLOSER MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT. AIR LIMITED AFTER THAT BETTER HUH. OKAY ANYWAY- THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN- AS WAS MENTIONED WE'VE HAD MASS SHOOTINGS THAT ARE COUNTY BOARD GOING BY OUR GIRL IS THE MOST NOTED ONE CULTURE IN OUR COMMUNITY REALLY MY CHANGES MUST BE TREATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS TO CHANGE THE PARADIGM OF HOW WE HUMAN BEINGS WILL ADVANCE SAFER COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE OVER THIRTEEN RETAIL GUN SHOP IN VENTURA COUNTY PROVIDING REGISTERED SAFE ACCESS TO OWNERSHIP OF THE COALITION TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE UNLIKE LICENSED GUN STORES BOTH FEDERALLY LICENSED DEALERS AND UNLICENSED SELLERS CAN SELL GUNS AT GUN SHOWS GUN SHOWS ARE NOT A PROTECTED CLASS IN SHOULDN'T BE GRANTED THAT STATUS. GUN SHOWS AT THE FAIRGROUNDS ENHANCE THE CULTURE. THE GUY BEING- EVERY DAY EVERY USE- AND BEING AS WAS PART OF OUR CHILD'S REGULAR SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT WHEN YOU STEP UP AND SPEAK UP TO CHANGE THE PICTURE OF THIS. YOU CAN'T BRING NORTH SELL GUNS IN CITY HALL OR COUNTY BUILDING. WILL SHOULD BE APPLIED TO ALL TAXPAYER PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTIES. WITH OF COURSE EXCEPTIONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS. WE REALLY MUST CHANGE THE CULTURE NO LONGER PUT PROFITS IN FRONT OF OUR COMMUNITY TO START AT THE FAIR GROUNDS THAT CELEBRATE. OUR YOUTH AND OUR FAMILIES AND NOT GUN SHOWS. IT IS REALLY INCUMBENT ON US TO TAKE A STRONG STATEMENT THAT THIS PUBLIC OWNED PROPERTY REPRESENTS A MAJORITY OF OUR RESIDENTS YOU STRIVE FOR SAFE COMMUNITIES. AND A CULTURE THAT PROMOTES HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. WITH YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION THE PARADIGM WILL SHIFT AND WE CAN ALL WORK TO ADVANCE HEALTHCARE SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. I THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME. OKAY AND NOW- PARKER. THE NON ON THE WAY TESTIFIED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS PAPER BAN- I AM A MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN AND I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE. GUNS ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION CIVILIAN OWNED FIREARMS IN THE U. S. MORE GUNS THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE AND THAT NUMBER IS ONLY INCREASING. TWENTY TWENTY RECORDED THE MOST GUN SALES IN A SINGLE YEAR EVER. IN CALIFORNIA AND SOMEONE IS KILLED WITH A GUN EVERY THREE HOURS. THE HUMAN AND FISCAL HOLE IN HIS GUN VIOLENCE CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD DOWN THE STREET FROM MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL. THERE WAS AN ANGRY BOYFRIEND WITH A GUY THIS FATHER THE- PROCEDURE TEACHERS LOCK THEIR- DOORS TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS AND THE KIDS HAD TO HIDE UNDER THEIR DESKS. TWENTY MINUTES PAST WELL NOBODY KNEW IF THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER ON CAMPUS CIRCUIT WITH THE DROUGHT GRADE AT THAT TIME HER CLASSROOM WAS FILLED WITH TERRIFIED TEN YEAR OLD HIDING IN THE DARK AND A TEACHER TRYING TO CALM THEM. PLEADING WITH THEM TO BE QUIET. IT WAS EXTREMELY TRAUMATIZING EXPERIENCE FOR THE KIDS THAT WAS. THREE YEARS AGO AND SHE STILL TALKS ABOUT IT. NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BOYFRIEND HAD A GHOST GUN BY SOMEONE WITH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RECORDS WOULD NOT PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK. BUT EVEN WITH THE PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD HE COULD WALK INTO A GUN SHOW INVITED MANY GOES GUNS AS HE WANTED CASH AND CARRY. IT'S INTUITIVE THAT DOMESTIC ABUSERS SHOULD NOT HAVE EASY ACCESS TO GUNS BUT THEY DO IN CALIFORNIA. GHOST GUNS ARE RECOVERED FROM CRIME SCENES IN INCREASING NUMBERS THERE ARE A GROWING PROBLEM FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WEAPON OF CHOICE FOR. CRIMINALS OR ANYONE WHO WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK OR IS UNDER AGE.EITHER UN SERIALIZED AND UNTRACEABLE GUNS. FLOODING INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND FUELING OUR GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC. THE SHOOTER DOWN THE STREET AT THE BORDERLINE BAR AND GRILL USED BANNED HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES. THESE MAGAZINES ALLOWED HIM TO FIRE UNINTERRUPTED WITHOUT HAVING TO PAUSE TO RELOAD AND POSSIBLY GIVE HIS VICTIMS THE CHANCE TO GET AWAY. DID HE BY THOSE HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES AT THE GUN SHOW. HE KILLED THIRTEEN PEOPLE THAT DAY WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP THIS SENSELESS GUN VIOLENCE AND NOW IS THE TIME. THE GUN SHOW CAN MOVE TO A VENUE THAT ISN'T OWNED BY THE STATE AND SUBSIDIZE WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE. THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY.

OF WELL NOW- BERTIE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS MANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS. AT THE SERVICE HERE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT FOR YOUR BILL- THIS IS SPECIFIC TO RIVERSIDE ARMENIA VENTURA COUNTY CORRECT. SO WHY DID THE BOARDS NOT JUST DO THIS THEMSELVES IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MENTOR COUNTY EMBRACES. GOOD QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE VENTURA COUNTY FAIR BOARD JUST BEEN VOTING FOUR TO THREE- CONSISTENTLY ON THIS ISSUE AND ONE OF THE REASONS CITED BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO SUPPORT YET AS THEY FEEL LIKE THE STATE- THIS SPRING A STATE FAIRGROUNDS AT THE STATE SHOULD BE TAKING THIS ACTION THEY'RE GETTING ADVICE- THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL. EXETER THAT THAT'S THE MORE APPROPRIATE LEVEL TO DO THIS SO- BUT BOTTOM LINE IS. AN ISSUE THE PEOPLE ON- EVERYWHERE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ARE FAIR BOARD- ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE MEANT ANYWHERE NEAR THE MAJORITY VIEW OF THE PEOPLE OF VENTURA COUNTY I THINK THE MORE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE IS THE FACT THAT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF INTER COUNTY VOTED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THE CITY COUNCIL OF VENTURE OF WHERE THE FAIRGROUNDS IS LOCATED OR VOTED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. IN OXNARD- THE LARGEST CITY IN VENTURA COUNTY ALL THREE AND THEY'RE THE CLOSEST CITIES TO THE FAIRGROUNDS SO THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN VERY CLEARLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THE FAIR BOARD- UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T I THINK REFLECT THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY AND- VENTURA COUNTY AND PARTICULARLY ANYWHERE NEAR THE FAIRGROUNDS THANK YOU DO YOU. THINK MAYBE THAT'S BE. BUSINESS TO. AND MAKING THEM VIABLE OR DID THEY FEEL OTHER PEOPLE PEOPLE INVENTOR WILL GO TO NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES AND SHOP THERE INSTEAD I THINK I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS THAT IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS TO ATTRIBUTE WHAT WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE'S MOTIVES ARE FOR WHAT THEY DO UNDERSTAND. FOR THE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEEN OTHER- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE INTEREST FROM OF PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE STATE THAT HAVE- CALLED IN ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A REQUEST OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN VENTURA COUNTY- THIS IS A BILL THAT IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO VENTURA COUNTY THE VENTURA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD THIS WAY. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADJOURNMENT YOU'RE WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR THIS I KNOW OTHER OF PARAGRAPHS HAVE COME TO THIS THIS IS COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY- TO DO THE SAME DANCE- IT MUST BE SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK IS APPROPRIATE THAT THE STATE TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN STATE FAIRGROUNDS AND SO I DID IS TELLING APPROPRIATE FOR US. TO MAKE DETERMINATION WITH THAT. AND I VOTE. I NEED A SECOND. A SECOND OVERALL ON EIGHTY SEVEN SIXTY NINE BY SUMMER BENNETT THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER I'D LACKEY LACKEY NO BONTA.

TO KILEY IT THE OTHER ONE WENT A LITTLE LONGER. AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD WE WERE. HOPEFULLY WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND AGAIN THANK YOU TO MR KILEY MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR WOULD EXTEND THE SUNSET ON THE AUTHORITY USE ACTUAL PERSPIRATION JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT WATCHING PERSPIRATION IS A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS VIOLATIONS OF AN OFFENDER AS CONDITIONS OF PROBATION. OR MANDATORY SUPERVISION BY OPPOSING THE SHORT DETENTION OF UP TO TEN DAYS AND CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN DETERRING FUTURE VIOLATIONS. THE SANCTIONS LIKE FLASHING CARS IN BOUNCE THE NEED TO HOLD OFFENDERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR VIOLATIONS. OTHER SUPERVISION WHILE FOCUSING ON SHORTER DISRUPTIONS FROM WORK HOME OR PROGRAMMING WITHOUT FLASHING CARS RACING NORMAL REVOCATION HEARINGS WOULD TAKE PLACE RESULTING. IN LONG COURT PROCEEDINGS AND UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IN CUSTODY. THIS BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. ARE SIMPLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU AND I WITH ME AS A WITNESS IS DANIEL SANCHEZ FROM THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHEAP PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA- PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR- PROBATION UTILIZES GRADUATED INTERVENTIONS- TO ADDRESS VIOLATIONS OF A PERSON'S COURT ORDERED- TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION THESE GRADUATED INTERVENTIONS ARE INTENDED TO BE- INCREMENTAL AND PROPORTIONAL- AND REALLY REFLECTS A LOT- THE SCIENCE AND THE EVIDENCE. BASED RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENING WITH SWIFT AND CERTAIN RESPONSES WHILE TRYING TO BE AS LESS DISRUPTIVE AS POSSIBLE TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S- REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND OTHER CONTINUITY OF SERVICES- THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING. CAN YOU TO USES OPTION SHORT OF USING FLASH OR FILING A PETITION OF REVOCATION WHEN SAFE AND APPROPRIATE TO ADDRESS COURT VIOLATIONS OF PROBATION VERY MUCH RECOGNISES THAT CHANGES A PROCESS AND WE ARE INVESTED IN SEEING PEOPLE SUCCEED AND DO WELL- HOWEVER THERE ARE CERTAIN. INSTANCES AND SIGNIFICANT VIOLATIONS THAT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BRINGING SOMEBODY BACK BEFORE THE COURT. AND USING A FLASH IS A GRADUATED INTERVENTION IS A WAY TO ADDRESS- THOSE SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS IN A BALANCED WAY TOO AGAIN TRY TO KEEP CONTINUITY FOR THEM- IN IN THEIR- PROBATION. WITHOUT FLASHES AN INTERMEDIATE RESPONSE THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF BRINGING SOMEBODY BACK BEFORE THE COURT. AT THE EXISTING MECHANISM TO ADDRESS THESE TYPES OF VIOLATIONS IS TO INITIATE FORMAL REVOCATION COURT PROCEEDINGS- WHICH IS A MUCH LENGTHIER PROCESS I CAN RESULT IN MUCH LONGER PERIODS OF CUSTODY- I WOULD JUST KNOW WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE COURTS AND MANY MANY STAKEHOLDERS- OVER THE YEARS AND DEVELOPING THIS. THERE IS LANGUAGE THAT I MEAN THIS BILL. THAT PROVIDES THE ABILITY FOR A PERSON TO DECLINE FLASH INSTEAD GO THROUGH THE COURT REVOCATION PROCESS- AND SO IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- WE CERTAINLY SEE THIS AS A BALANCED APPROACH TO- HOLDING INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE MAINTAINING SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS BUT AGAIN IN A WAY THAT FOCUSES ON. SHORTER DISRUPTIONS FROM WORK HOME PROGRAMMING THAT CAN RESULT FROM THOSE LONGER TERM REVOCATIONS- BECAUSE ULTIMATELY OUR GOAL IS TO. AT YOU KNOW ENSURE THE SAFETY BUT TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT WORKING- IN THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. AS A WITHOUT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON AB SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR THANK YOU.

PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN A PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS THE BILL BE SAFER NEIGHBOURHOOD AND SCHOOLS ACT- THE INITIATIVE IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO LOWER CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION WILL ALLOW IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM FOCUS ON MORE SERIOUS CRIMES BUT WHAT WE'VE NOW SEEN SEVEN YEARS LATER IS THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LESS SAFE THAN EVER. PROP FORTY SEVEN- WHEN IT WAS IT INTRODUCED WHEN HIS PROPOSED WAS NEARLY UNIVERSALLY OPPOSED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE REASONS BECAME CLEAR SOON AFTER ITS PASSAGE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE YEAR AFTER- PROP FORTY SEVEN PASSED THE LA TIMES REPORTED THAT QUOTE LAW. OFFICIALS AND OTHERS HAVE AIMS PROP FORTY SEVEN FOR ALLOWING REPEAT OFFENDERS TO CONTINUE BREAKING THE LAW WITH LITTLE CONSEQUENCE. A SEPARATE PIECE IN THE TIMES FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORTED THAT IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES PROPERTY CRIMES SUCH AS BURGLARIES AND MOTOR VEHICLE THEFTS HAVE RISEN TEN POINT 9% COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR VIOLENT CRIMES SUCH AS AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS AND ROBBERIES HAS SOARED TWENTY POINT SIX PERCENT. OUR STUDY WHO IS MARITIME I TOLD THE TIMES THAT THOSE INCREASES MAY BE LINKED TO PROP FORTY SEVEN. IN MAY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED LARGE RETAILERS INCLUDING SAFE WAY TARGET RITE AID AND CVS PHARMACIES SAY SHOPLIFTING INCREASED AT LEAST 15% AND IN SOME CASES DOUBLED SINCE VOTERS APPROVED PROP FORTY SEVEN. A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA FOUND THE PROP FORTY SEVEN LED TO A SPIKE IN CASES OF LARCENY AND MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT. DESCRIBING THAT STUDY THE LA TIMES REPORTED THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS DECISION TO REDUCE PENALTIES FOR DRUG AND PROPERTY CRIMES IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CONTRIBUTED TO A JUMP IN CAR BURGLARIES SHOPLIFTING AND OTHER THEFT LARCENIES JUMPED IN CALIFORNIA AS THEY DECLINED ELSEWHERE. WE ALSO SAW A MARKET DECLINE PARTICIPATION IN A DRUG ARTS DRUG TREATMENT- OWING TO THE LACK OF LEVERAGE THE PROSECUTORS NOW HAD I TO ENCOURAGE OFFENDERS TO SIGN UP FOR TREATMENT. OVER TIME THE SITUATION HAS CONTINUED TO WORSEN IT IS REACHED A BREAKING POINT IN RECENT MONTHS LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER MAJOR CITIES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN STRICKEN BY LARGE SCALE ORGANIZED RETAIL STOPS RESULTING IN NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE BEING STOLEN. A SPOKESPERSON FOR TARGET ANY TO SAID IN A STATEMENT FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT AND ALARMING RISE IN THEFT AND SECURITY INCIDENTS. AT OUR SAN FRANCISCO STORES SIMILAR TO REPORTS FROM OTHER RETAILERS IN THE AREA. IN THE LAST YEAR TRAIN COMPANY OFFICIALS AT UNION PACIFIC RELEASED DATA SHOWING A ONE HUNDRED AND 60% YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IN THEFT ALL THEIR LINES BLAMING THE SPIKE ON CHANGES TO HOW LOW LEVEL OFFENSES ARE PROSECUTED. TAKING IN THE SCENE GAVIN NEWSOM SAID THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. ALL THE ALL PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT. RETAILERS ARE OFTEN I AT THIS POINT I JUST AVOID CONFRONTATIONS WITH SHOPLIFTERS OR DON'T EVEN FILE POLICE REPORTS- BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT- NOTHING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IF THEY DO. SO THIS CREATED THIS IS CREATED A TOTAL BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF LAW SYSTEM WAR CRIMINALS FEEL WHOLLY FREE TO ACT OUTSIDE OF THE LAW WITHOUT FEAR. OF LEGAL CONSEQUENCES WE'VE ALL SEEN VIDEOS OF WHAT HAPPENS- THERE WAS ONE THAT WENT VIRAL RECENTLY WHERE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO WALGREENS A MAN CASUALLY LOADS HIS BICYCLE I WITH THE BAG FULL OF STOLEN GOODS. AND IS BARELY EVEN OUT HAPA BOTHERED AS HE AS HE RIDES OUT AS HE WALKS OUT THE DOOR. IT IS SIMPLY NOT FAIR TO LAW ABIDING CALIFORNIANS WHO DESERVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SAFE SAFE TO LIVE IN SAFETY. AGAIN BEEN STATE. KIDS OPEN AND IT'S ALL NOT FAIR TO THE- THEMSELVES WHO ARE DEPRIVED OF THE TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION NEEDED. TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND. IF WE ARE GOING TO DO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A SMART STRATEGIC. EVIDENCE BASED WAY. PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS THE OPPOSITE A BLIND AND SWEEPING DECRIMINALIZATION. WHICH TOOK A HATCHET TO OUR PENAL CODE AND IMPERILLED OUR CITIZENRY. CALIFORNIANS ARE UNWILLING TO TOLERATE THIS ANY LONGER. ACCORDING TO A POLL BY UC BERKELEY'S INSTITUTE OF GOVERNMENTAL STUDIES 78% OF RESPONDENTS FEEL THAT CRIME IS INCREASING IN CALIFORNIA. AND BY A TWO TO ONE MARGIN. CALIFORNIA VOTERS FAVOR CHANGES TO PROP FORTY SEVEN. EVEN ATTORNEY GENERAL ART ROB BONTA SAID THAT SOME FOLKS ARE WONDERING IF THERE IS CAUSATION BETWEEN THESE PROPOSITIONS REFERRING TO 47-57 AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY AND ATTORNEY GENERAL DECIDED THAT YES THERE MAY BE. HE SAID HE BACKS CHANGES TO ADDRESS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES CONSEQUENCES AND TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. NOW I SERVED WITH MR BONTA FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE WE ARE NOT EXACTLY IN LOCKSTEP ON ISSUES OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ARE PRETTY MUCH DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED DIFFERENT VOTING RECORDS BUT AT THE POINT AT WHICH BOTH OF US ARE SAYING THERE NEEDS TO BE CHANGES- I THINK THAT IS A VERY GOOD REASON. FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO ADVANCE THIS BILL TODAY AND IN FACT BY VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS MEASURE YOU'RE NOT EVEN SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO NECESSARILY I'LL GET RID OF PROP FORTY SEVEN ALL YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU WANT TO LET THE VOTERS DECIDE. THAT IS WHAT THIS MEASURE DOES AS GEORGE SKELTON WROTE IN THE LA TIMES PROP FORTY SEVEN SHOULD B RETURNED TO THE VOTERS AND EXCHANGE FOR A PRODUCT THAT WORKS BETTER FOR US ONE. MY FIRST WITNESS SIDE TO IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE DIVERT YOUR SON WHO IS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY- ELDORADO COUNTY IN THE IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT. OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. ONE DIDN'T USED TO BE IRISH TIMES THE- OKAY WE CAN ABOUT THAT OKAY THANK. CHAIR IN THANK YOU S. MEMBER- KILEY AND THANK YOU TO THEM ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. FOR PERMITTING US TO BE HERE AS INDICATED I'M MY NAME IS VERN PIERSON AND IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT OF CDA. I'M HERE TODAY BOTH AS THEY'LL DORADO COUNTY D. A. AS WELL AS ON BEHLF OF. THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. ENCOURAGING YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I WILL WILL ECHO JUST A FEW THINGS THAT- SIMILAR KILEY ALLUDED TO. BUT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IS A RECOGNITION OF OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL. THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE AND- HOWEVER WELL INTENTIONED PROP FORTY SEVEN. A WELL INTENTIONED. SUPPORTED IT- OVER TIME WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. IS THAT IT HAD HAS HAD NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. THAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO GIVE THE VOTERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT- MOST NOTABLY THAT I WANT TO DRESS TODAY. IS THAT- PROP FORTY SEVEN ESSENTIALLY KILLED THE DRUG COURTS IN CALIFORNIA. BY ELIMINATING ANY CONSEQUENCE- IN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THE JUDGES THAT HAVE WERE CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE DRUG COURTS- AND LEADING TO EFFECTIVE REHABILITATION. ALL OF THEM ARE UNANIMOUS IN SAYING IF YOU TALK TO THEM OBVIOUSLY JUDGES ARE NOT LOBBYING BUT- TALK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES PROP FORTY SEVEN K. RECORDS. AND WITH THAT I WOULD YIELD BACK TO REBEL TO THE TIME TO THE. OTHERS- YES. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN UNDERSTAND DICUS IN THE SHERPAS ALBERTINO I REPRESENT TWO POINT TWO MILLION RESIDENTS I ALSO REPRESENT TEN MUNICIPAL POLICE CHIEF FOURTEEN CONTRACTS CITIES AND THE LAWN JUSTICE GROUP IN SAN MARINO COUNTY. SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN WE'VE EXPERIENCED A NUMBER OF STATE REALIGNMENT INITIATIVES THAT HAVE PUSHED TRADITIONALLY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL COUNTIES AND CITIES AND AS A RESULT OF THAT PROP FORTY SEVEN IS JUST ONE OF THESE THINGS. AS WE WRANGLE WITH THIS CONVERSATION I'M GONNA COME INTO LOCKSTEP IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR IN A RECENT CONVERSATION WITH YOU WE SAID THIS WASN'T AN PROP FORTY SEVEN PROBLEM WELL I BEG TO DIFFER IT IS A PROP FORTY SEVEN PROBLEM. WHERE I AM IN LOCKSTEP WITH YOU IS THAT ANYTIME YOU TALK ABOUT ANY OF THESE INITIATIVES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAPACITY AND MOSTLY LACK THERE OF. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES TO PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE AND FORCE YOUR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO TRY TO BUILD THESE CAPACITIES THAT DO NOT EXIST. I WOULD EXPRESS TO YOU THAT YOU WOULD SUPPORT FIFTEEN NINETY NINE SO THAT IT CAN GO BACK TO THE VOTERS AND HEAR WHAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE TO SAY AS A RELEASE AS IT RELATES TO CRIME. AND THE NUMBER OF CAPACITIES EXIST THIS IS BRITTANY FOR ALL OF US TO PARTNER ACROSS THE AISLE FROM EACH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT. BLUE LAUNCHED ABOUT DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR CITIZENS IF WE MEET TOGETHER WE BUILD THESE CAPACITIES WILL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF DATA. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A LOT OF DATA FROM YOUR BUSINESS IS OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T REPORT PETTY THEFT ANYMORE BECAUSE THERE'S NO. POINTS IS FOR THAT CRIME. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE COMMISSION CALIFORNIA FORD IN SAN MARINO COUNTY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE JAIL UTILIZATION STUDY. IN THAT STUDY. BASED ON PRISON REALIGNMENT WE HOLD PEOPLE THAT SOCIETY ARE TRULY AFRAID OF. THE ONES THAT WE CAN AFFECT THE MOST TWO DIFFERENT REFORMS. ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH TIME IN JAIL THIS IS WHAT THE STUDY PROVED FORWARD NOT EVEN THIRTY DAYS SO NO G. E. D. NO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TRAINING THEY GET STARTED AND THEY DON'T FINISH WHILE THEY'RE IN CUSTODY WITH US. THE LACK OF DRUG COURT WE HAVE A HUMAN CONDITION THAT'S EXPRESSED IN OUR STREETS RIGHT NOW OUR PEOPLE ARE RIDING IN THEIR OWN SKIN BECAUSE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO INTERVENTION. AS IT RELATES TO THIS. AND THE LIFE'S BLOOD. OF THIS STATE IS OUR BUSINESSES WHO ARE LEAVING BECAUSE WE CANNOT PROTECT THEM AND THEY'RE BECOMING VICTIMIZED. AND LOSING MONEY WHICH ALSO RESULTS OBVIOUSLY AND TAXES AND OUR ABILITY IS PUBLIC SAFETY TO SUPPORT HIM. I WOULD URGE ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN NINETY NINE. GET BACK TO THE VOTERS HERE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY UNLESS MAKE CALIFORNIA SAFE. AND BRING. CONGRESSIONAL SEATS BACK TO THE STATE AND SHOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IS ALIVE AND WELL THANK YOU.

AND IF WE NEED TO BE FOR CLASS PLEASE BE CLOSE. AND I HAVE TOM HOFFMAN'S THE- CALIFORNIA STATE DIGESTIVE AND ST LOUIS AT THE RECIDIVISM COALITION. BOTH TESTIFYING IN PERSON. SAME RULES YOU HAVE A FIVE MINUTES TOTAL WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO SPLIT UP BECAUSE SENIOR PUBLIC SAFETY ADVISER FOR CALIFORNIA FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. IN A PREVIOUS LIFE I SPENT THIRTY ONE YEARS IN MUNICIPAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY YEARS LIVING WITH PD OFFICER TO CAPTAIN ELEVEN YEARS WITH WAS SACRAMENTO DO A DIP THE CHIEF. CAPTAIN THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF OUR RETIRED FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPOINTED THE HEAD OF STATE PAROLE BY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AND I WASN'T SIX. AGAIN UP APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- SERVE IN THAT CAPACITY FOR ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS. OF WE'RE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO OF FIFTEEN NINETY NINE. OF THE IF WE LOOK AT THE CENTRAL PREMISE OF THE OF THIS BILL. SUGGESTING THAT- PROP FORTY SEVEN DECRIMINALIZE THESE OFFENSES AND BASICALLY DOG BECAUSE DOOR TO APPROVAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO BE NEUTERED. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. ALL THESE CRIMES ARE STILL MISDEMEANORS THEY CAN BE PROSECUTED. THE DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE IS JUST THAT A DISCRETIONARY DECISION NOT TO SPEAKERS OF THE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR TIRE SYSTEM IS OVERLOADED. BUT THEY CAN BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THEY CAN'T BE CONVICTED THEY CAN BE SENTENCED TO A COUNTY JAIL THEY CAN BE ORDERED INTO TREATMENT IS A DECISION NOT TO DO THAT. SECONDARILY IT'S LOG ON THE PREMISE THAT IN THIS NOT TO BE. BUT CHIEF WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ARREST PEOPLE IN PUT THEM IN BY THIS IS AS FAR. WELL WE ALL BE JUST FINE. THAT COLLIDES WITH HISTORIC FACTS AND THAT FACT IS THAT IN THIS IS A BIT PAINFUL. TO TO ADMIT AS A CAREER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AFTER THE FACT VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE CAPTURED AND IDENTIFIED AND BROUGHT TO TRIAL VERY FEW. THE JUNGLE CURRENT DOJ STATS FOR CASE CLEARANCE OF THE CRIMES LISTED IN IMPROV FORTY SEVEN THIS YEAR OR LAST YEAR'S USE ME EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT. THAT DOES REPORTED CRIMES HALF OF THESE CRIMES ARE NEVER REPORTED WHICH IS A PROBLEM WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT. SAN FRANCISCO PD IS AN EXAMPLE WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES WE'VE ALL ABOUT FOR THE FORTY FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS. TWO PEOPLE ARE THREE POINT SIX SEVEN CLEARANCE RATE. SO IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE IS THAT AN OUTCOME THERE'S A CHEAT LESS THAN 5% OF THE TIME LESS THAN THAT IS SOMEHOW THE CORNERSTONE PIECE OF. LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE PUBLIC SAFETY AND THEN TO MAINTAIN IT. AND THEN ALSO SAYS THAT IF WE CAN'T DO THAT THEN THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S ALSO NOT TRUE. THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SYSTEM IF IT'S GOING TO BE EXERCISED. ROAD TO THE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR THRESHOLD. WELL I'M THINKING WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY STATE IN THE UNION HAS A THRESHOLD THAT TRIGGERS THE MOVEMENT BETWEEN MISDEMEANOR FELONY. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS A THRESHOLD THAT EXCEEDS THE THRESHOLD IN THIRTY NINE OTHER STATES. IT BROILED RELATIVE TO THE FUNDING WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT. IN THIS COMING YEAR A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GO BACK INTO COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND RESOURCES INCLUDING VICTIM HELP. THAT'S GENERATED UNIQUELY BY PROP FORTY SEVEN AND UNIQUELY TARGETED TOWARDS THOSE- THOSE SORT. OF THOSE RESOURCES AND HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY THE- BORDER STATE COMMIT A COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS THAT WORK IT REDUCES RECIDIVISM WHY WE TURN AROUND SAY WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ANYMORE WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIGNIFY THAT MONEY. WHAT'S THE PUBLIC BENEFIT I TELL. YOU MINUTES LEFT ARE YOU OKAY TO QUICKLY. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. WHAT IS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT TO TELLING PEOPLE THEY CAN NO LONGER CHANGE THEIR OR THE RECORD FROM A FELONY TO A MISDEMEANOR. WHY WOULD WE DO THAT DO WE NOT UNDERSTAND THAT A FELONY CONVICTION IS A IT PUTS A BALL AND CHAIN AROUND PEOPLE'S FEET THAT IS JUST INCREDIBLE BY SOME COUNTS FOUR THOUSAND LEGISLATIVELY IMPOSE YOU CAN'T LOSE AS A FELON. WHY WOULD WE NOT ALLOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LAW ABIDING WHOSE CONVICTIONS ARE DECADES OLD NOT COME BACK IN A POSITION THE COURT TO GET THOSE SENTENCES OF THOSE CONVICTIONS REDUCED TO MISDEMEANOR. I JUST THINK THAT IS ILL CONCEIVED AND LARGELY- I DON'T WANT TO SEE DISINGENUOUS BUT- I THINK OF THE PUBLIC REALLY KNOWS THE TRUTH ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS THEY CONTINUE TO VOTE FOR- THERE WAS AN INITIATIVE JUSTIN LAST THE LAST YEAR'S ELECTION. THAT 62% OF THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR SO. IT WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE FOR THAT AND MANY OTHER REASONS. YEAH THANK YOU FOR A- GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN- CHAIRMAN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SAM LEWIS AND I'M THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB ONE FIVE NINE NINE. KERN IN EXISTING RETAIL THEFT STATUTES ALREADY ALLOW PROSECUTORS BRING FELONY CHARGES AGAINST ANYONE WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR CARRYING OUT THESE TYPES OF THIS. ASK OUR VOTERS TO GET TOUGHER ON CRIME DOES NOT GIVE ANYONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS THAT STILL HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEFT CRIMES. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS AT ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION KNOW FIRST HAND HOW INCREASED PUNISHMENT OF INCARCERATION DO NOT MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFER BUT HAVE HAD SEVERE LONG LASTING EFFECTS ON OUR COMMUNITIES. A. R. C. MEMBERS KNOW FIRST HAND THE BALLOTS THAT THAT THAT VERSE OUTCOMES OF TOUGH ON CRIME THAT LEGISLATION MANY OF OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE MYSELF SERVE LONG PRISON TERMS BECAUSE OF THOSE LEGISLATION. BUILT ON THE FEAR OF RISING CRIME. OUR MEMBERS HAVE ALSO BENEFITED FROM PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN AND BOTH SENTENCE REDUCTION AND THE CHANCE TO HAVE THEIR RECORDS EXPUNGED OR RE ENTRY. THIS OPPORTUNITY HAS LED MANY R. C. MEMBERS INFORMED INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN GENERAL TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY BY GIVING THEM HOPE AND INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THIS REENTERING PROCESS. FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE BENEFITED FROM PROGRAMS A PROP FORTY SEVEN SAVINGS SUPPORTED SUCH AS DRUG TREATMENT. IN A HEALTH AND MANY OTHER VITAL RESOURCES THESE SERVICES ARE USED BY PHONE AND COURSE RATED PEOPLE THAT PROVIDE NOT ONLY INCOME BUT OUTCOMES. I'M AN EXAMPLE OF NOW BECAUSE- BETTER STABLE LONG JOURNEY SECOND LONG TERM AND FOR FEEL CAREERS THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS SOME OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE TOUGH ON STATE CRIMES HAVE HIRED DIVIDING LINES IN CALIFORNIA- AND PROPS PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN TEXAS WAS AT ONE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SINCE TO RAISE THE BAR AND IT HAS SINCE RAISED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. TEXAS IS A TOUGH ON CRIME STATE SOUTH CAROLINA AND EVEN MORE SPACE IN THAT AGAIN AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID THIRTY NINE OTHER STATES HAVE A FELONY THEFT THE US FROM THE THREAT OF STREP THRESHOLD HIGHER. IN CALIFORNIA ROOM THERE IN OPPOSITION NAME AN ORGANIZATION. THE MORNING IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK- BARCODEGEORGE OF THE HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU.

I WAS FIRST SWORE INTO THE LEAD ON DECEMBER SECOND. TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE VERY FIRST BILL I INTRODUCED WAS AB FORTY SEVEN. AND IT WAS A MEASURE TO- ATTEMPTS TO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE PROP FORTY SEVEN. AND THEN ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS FOUND A POSITION OF DATE RAPE DRUGS. WE'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE HELLO CASUALLY WALK AROUND ACADEMY IN ROHYPNOL FOR RECREATIONAL USE. LET'S BE HONEST FOLKS PEOPLE IN POSSESSION OF DATE RAPE DRUGS ARE PHYSICALLY TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOMEONE. WHETHER IT BE YOUR DAUGHTER AT COLLEGE YOUR LIFE FOR SOMEONE ELSE YOU LOVE. VICTIMS BY NOW MORE VULNERABLE DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT TELLS CRIMINALS THAT THE STATE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT JUSTICE. YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. DUCT TAPE REPAIR JOBS LIKE LOWERING THE THRESHOLD AMOUNTS FOR PETTY THEFTS ARE ADMIRABLE. BUT THEY DON'T FIX THE ACTUAL PROBLEM AT HAND. WE NEED A FULL BLOWN REPEAL OF THE DANGEROUS PARTS OF PROP FORTY SEVEN. AND I WOULD SAY THE REALITY OF THE OUTCOME WHETHER I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE INTENT BUT IT IS THE REALITY. I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT WORKED IN RETAIL. JUST RECENTLY AND- SHE WAS ADVISED BY HER MANAGEMENT THAT WHEN THEY WITNESS PEOPLE ACTUALLY STEALING FROM THAT RETAIL CENTER THAT THEY'RE NOT TO EVEN BRING ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM MUCH LESS REPORT. THAT'S THE REALITY THAT WE'RE FACING FOLKS AND I TELL YOU THAT I'M A BIT ENTERTAINED BY. THE OPPOSITION'S. ACCUSATION THAT PENALTY HAS NO IMPACT ON BEHAVIOR. THAT SIMPLY THEM WHY IN THE WORLD WE PASSED PROP FORTY SEVEN IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THAT YOUR PREMISE THAT'S AT ITS VERY FAULTY IN MY OPINION. THE COUNT ABILITY. MAY NOT BE WOKE BUT IT'S DESERVED AND FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE OPPOSING THIS. THANK YOU I LIKE THE COLORS I GOOFED UP. I'LL BE SPORTING AND HEART. MR FARAI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE WITNESSES TODAY. PROP FORTY SEVEN PAST SEVEN YEARS AGO IT WAS A FIRM BY VOTERS AND IT WAS REAFFIRMED. THROUGH THE OPPOSITION OF PROP TWENTY JUST LAST ELECTION CYCLE FORTY SEVEN PASSED. AND EVEN WITH A SLIGHT BUMP LAST YEAR WE ARE STILL NEAR FORTY YEAR HISTORICAL LOWS. AS WAS MENTIONED BY OUR WITNESSES HERE THIRTY EIGHT STATES THIRTY NINE STATES HAVE A HIGHER FELONY. THRESHOLD THAN EVEN CALIFORNIA NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THE PROGRESSIVE ALABAMA IS THAT FIFTEEN HUNDRED. GEORGE'S AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED TEXAS REYES THERE'S TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. COVED WRECKED COMMUNITIES IT TOOK PEOPLE'S BUSINESSES TO PEOPLE'S HOMES TO PEOPLE'S LIVES RISEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IT'S POVERTY IT'S STRUGGLE WITH DESPERATION I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM LANCASTER THAT DUCT TAPE MEASURES TO TRY TO REPAIR THESE HARMS ARE GOING TO DO ENOUGH WE NEED A FULL SCALE. ATTACK IN THAT ATTACK HAS TO BE ROOTED IN GETTING PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES GETTING PEOPLE ECONOMIC MOBILITY GETTING PEOPLE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET THAT BY SPENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE FOR STEALING LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS. THAT'S HOW WE GOT INTO THIS PROBLEM AT LEAST TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK TIME AND TIME AGAIN IT'S HOW WE IN THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WORLD GRATION WE OUT INCOME RIGHT SOME OF OUR CLOSEST PEERS CHINA RUSSIA. IN CALIFORNIA WE STILL SPEND FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR INCARCERATING EVEN NOW WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN. BUT PROP FORTY SEVEN HAS. GIVEN A SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN COST SAVINGS COST SAVINGS THEY HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN THE COMMUNITIES. THERE'S OVER A DOZEN TRAUMA CENTERS THAT HAVE COME UP BECAUSE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN. THE VICTIM SERVICES THAT HAVE INCREASED BECAUSE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN. IT WAS SMART STRATEGIC. EVIDENCE BASED AND APPROVED BY THE VOTERS NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO GO BACKWARDS. NOW IT'S TIME TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES THE MOVE FORWARD IN THOSE ROOT CAUSES. WE NEED COST SAVINGS TO ADDRESS PROP FORTY SEVEN REPEALING IT WOULD ROLL US BACKWARDS. I URGE THIS COMMITTEE IN MY COLLEAGUES TO STAND WITH ME IN OPPOSING THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU. IS THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE MR HOFFMAN I KNOW YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE MAY HAD HERE MORE LIKE MR KILEY WHEN YOU SAW ME LAST LIKE WAS LIKE WORK. THANK YOU- ANYWAY FIVE I THINK. THAT I GO BACK TO THE PREMISE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN WHEN IT WAS PRESENTED TO THE VOTERS. SAFE COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS. THAT'S WHAT THEY VOTED ON THAT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE VOTING ON THAT IN FACT WHAT HAS RESULTED IN THAT IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED THEY GET OUT AND THEN THEY CONTINUE TO GO DOWN THE PATH. OF COMMITTING CRIMES AND THOSE CRIMES ARE COMMITTED AGAINST WHO. ALLOW LIVE BY LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO. FIX THIS PROBLEM BY ALLOWING LOW LEVEL DRUG OFFENSES WHAT WE CALL LOW LEVEL DRUG OFFENSES TO BE TO MANIFEST THEMSELVES INTO PEOPLE. WHO CAN NO LONGER CARE FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A CONSTANT DRUG INDUCED PSYCHOSIS. SO NOW WE HAVE FAR MORE HOMELESS PEOPLE THAN WE EVER HAD IN A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE. ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THIS DRUG INDUCED PSYCHOSIS BECAUSE GUESS WHAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SIGN UP FOR THOSE BADLY NEEDED REHABILITATION FACILITIES AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET BETTER IN THIRTY DAYS I'VE SEEN THAT CYCLE. AS A PARAMEDIC IN INGLEWOOD. I GOT TO GO ON PEOPLE THEY WOULD GET ARRESTED FOR BEING ON HEROIN OR DOING THOSE TYPE OF DRUGS THEY WOULD GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM. I GUESS WHAT THEY'RE RIGHT BACK ON THE STREETS THIRTY DAYS LATERAND I'M GIVING HIM NOR CAN SO THEY CAN LIVE AGAIN. FOR NOT HELPING THOSE FOLKS OUT BY NOT BY BY ABIDING BY THIS PROP FORTY SEVEN IT DID NOT HELP THOSE PEOPLE AT ALL IT'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO HELP PEOPLE. SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS FOR THE VOTERS WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING SAFE COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO RECONSIDER WHETHER THAT IS THE END RESULT OF A POLICY THAT THEY SAID- WE BUY IT WE YEAH WE WANT SAFE COMMUNITIES SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET IT. AND NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY UPSET. AND WHETHER YOU THINK THEY'RE AT THEIR I'M JUSTIFIED OR NOT. I THINK GIVING THEM THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT THE PARTS OF PROPER FOR PROP FORTY SEVEN THAT THEY MAY NOT AGREE WITH AND IF THERE ARE PARTS IF THEY DO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN HAVE A WE CAN HAVE ABILL THAT THAT ADDRESSES THOSE. BUT YOU CANNOT SIT HERE AND TELL ME THAT PROP FORTY SEVEN HAS NO EFFECT ON CRIME. OR RECIDIVISM. THE ONLY RECIDIVISM IT HAS AN EFFECT ON. IS ONCE SOMEBODY GETS OUT OF PRISON THEY JUST SAY. ANY CRIMES ARE THE CRIMES YOU COMMIT BELOW THIS LEVEL FROM NOW ON WE'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY CONSIDER. YOU KNOW GETTING YOU BACK INTO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE% WE CAN FIX YOU WHAT NEEDS FIXED IS THE ENVIRONMENT. THE INCARCERATION ENVIRONMENT YES THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CAN BE REHAB AND WE NEED TO FIX THAT. BUT WE DON'T WORK ON THAT AT ALL STEP IN RECOGNIZING WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS AND THAT PROBLEM IS WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REHABILITATE PEOPLE THE RIGHT WAY. EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT. BECAUSE WE DON'T WE'RE DOING THEM A DISSERVICE WE'RE DOING EVERY LAW ABIDING CITIZEN WHO BECOMES A VICTIM AND I DON'T CARE IF THAT MEANS SOMEBODY BROKE OUT YOUR WINDOW. THEY ARE BECOMING A VICTIM AND THEY'RE SICK AND TIRED OF IT. I HEAR HIM ALL THE TIME. LIESER IS SICK AND TIRED OF IT. SO THAT'S WHY I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS. IS THAT RIGHT RIGHT M. SPORT YES. BECAUSE I WANT THIS I WANT US TO RECOGNIZE WHAT THE REAL PROBLEMS ARE IN OUR SYSTEM AND FIX THOSE AND STOP IGNORING THOSE PARTS OF IT. BECAUSE WE DO THAT I THINK THEN WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER OPPORTUNITY. DECORATE BETTER HUMAN BEING BETTERS BETTER CITIZENS JUST LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN HERE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU BONTA. I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT WE FOR DECADES HAVE BEEN OVER INCARCERATING AND UNDER REHABILITATING THE FACT THAT WE'VE ONLY SPENT- IN OUR CDC ARE BUDGET 1% OF OUR BUDGET TOWARDS REHABILITATION IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE ISSUE NOT WHETHER OR NOT PROP FORTY SEVEN EXISTS AND PROP FORTY SEVEN STILL DOES ALLOW AND DOESN'T PREVENT PROSECUTORS FROM CHARGING WHO WHEN WE PARTICIPATE IN ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT FOR FOUGHT WITHOUT. END AND FOR THAT REASON I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO. AT REPEAL. OF A LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED BY VOTERS. IN TWENTY TWENTY AND FOR THAT REASON I AM GOING TO OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. YOU MAKE CLOSEST KILEY YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED AT AS WITNESSES ON BOTH SIDES ON TESTIFIED TODAY- I DO NOT EXPECT ALL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO FULLY ADOPT MY WORLD WORLD VIEW WHEN IT COMES TO MATTERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE- BUT I WOULD ASK THAT YOU TO FOR- TO THE JUDGMENT OF OUR TWENTY GENERAL ROB BONTA. WHO SAID THAT WE NEED TO HAVE CHANGES I'D PROP FORTY SEVEN IN ORDER TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE TO ADDRESS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN FACT WHAT I'M ASKING IS EVEN MORE MODEST THAN THAT IT'S SIMPLY THAT YOU YOU DON'T NEED TO SUPPORT GUY OVERTURNING PROP FORTY SEVEN ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT YOU GIVE VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE SIDE THAT MATTER FOR THEMSELVES OUR LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS HERE SAID THAT HE BELIEVES THAT VOTERS- WOULD SUPPORT PROP FORTY SEVEN AGAIN. OKAY LET'S HAVE THAT DEBATE LET'S GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE THANK YOU AND- I DO BELIEVE WE DO NEED TO HAVE TO DISCUSSION- AS SOMEONE. THAT HAS THAT CAME IN. WITH AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA. AND PLANS TO LEAVE WITHIN ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA. I THINK I KNOW HOW TO BOXES. THANK YOU. I WORK WITH. D. A. BONTA TO LEGALIZE CANNABIS HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA SO I KNOW WHERE HIS HEART IS AND WHAT WHAT HE MEANT. AND WHAT HE REALLY MEANT WAS WE SHOULD BE GOING FROM HERE BEEN DRIVING LAW ENFORCEMENT POLICIES PROCEDURES STRATEGY FOR CENTURIES WE'VE GOT TO STOP THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE KEEP GOING UP AND DOWN LIKE THAT YOU'RE STATING THE FEAR POLL RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT HAS SWUNG IN THE SIDE OF TOUGH ON CRIME. AS SOON AS UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO DOES SOMETHING REALLY HORRENDOUS GOOD AFTERNOON AMERICAN OR A DEPORTATION OF LATINOS GOING GROW UP IN A RICE IN AUGUST AND THE FEAR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT APPROVAL. WE CANNOT BE ON THE SEASONAL GOING BACK AND FORTH WE NEED TO STOP WE CHECKED WE ALL. AGREE I WENT TO A MEETING WITH MY- LET. AT MR LACKEY SAID YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL RISEN ROOM FULL OF ALL. LAW ENFORCEMENT N. B. I'M FOR ALL OF AMERICA WHERE WE TELLING ME HOW PROP FORTY SEVEN DIDN'T WORK. AND THEY WERE BURKE RATING WHAT WE HAD VOTED ON. AND GUESS WHAT I UNDERSTOOD THAT MR LACKEY SAID NOW YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL. AND IT IT WHAT IT EXPRESSED TO ME IS. WE'RE NOT WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY. WE'RE TALKING AT ONE ANOTHER. I WISH WE COULD MAKE A LAW. RIGHT NOW WE GET. MISTER MISTER LEWIS MISTER HOFFMAN PUT HIM IN A ROOM WITH MR DICHAS AND MISTER PEARSON IT HAD WORKED OUT A COLLABORATIVE JOINT IDEA OF HOW WE SOLVE CRIED AND HOW WE HOW WE WORK TO MAKE PROP FORTY SEVEN BETTER. THIS BILL THROWS THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER IT DOES NOT GIVE THE CITIZENS AN OPPORTUNITY AND I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYONE. THAT HAD DIFFERING VIEWS ON PROPERTY SEVEN. IN A WAY WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER NOT ELIMINATED NOT GET RID OF IT NOT DEMONIZED IT. WE NEED TO MAKE IT BETTER SO THAT IT DOES WORK FOR WHAT PEOPLE WANTED TO BE. A LOT OF US BECAUSEWE DID NOT PUT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE IS AB ONE OH NINE STEPS STARTED THIS UP INTO NINE WE NEVER REALLY INVESTED. THE MONEY PROPERLY IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT IS HOUSING. DRUG TREATMENT. MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT GETTING PEOPLE JOBS GETTING EDUCATED. LET ME TRIED THIS THIS COURT AGREED THAT. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO EITHER GO TO JAIL. ARE YOU GOING TO DRIVE YOU HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH. WE DID IN L. A. COUNTY YOU KNOW WE GOT. THE LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY IMAGE AND THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE SHERIFF IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT EQUIPPED AND SHOULD THEY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT BECAUSE OF THESE TOUGH ON CRIME LAWS. THAT'S WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH YES SHE GOT HIM OFF THE STREET OUT OF SIGHT THEREFORE FOR WEALTHY AMERICA THEY MADE TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. AND GIVE YOU SOME SENSE OF PRIDE BUT IT ALSO INCARCERATED MANY POOR BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS AND TOTALLY DECIMATED. DECIMATED AREAS RILEY LIKE SOUTH LA EAST LA AND OTHER PLACES. AND SELL LESS BLAMING ONE ANOTHER. AGAIN I WISH I COULD MAKE A LAW. THE FORCE BOTH SIDES GET HIM IN A ROOM I THOUGHT WHEN WE WERE SITTING WITH MR LACKEY AND I'M- IT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD EVER COME IN MASS TO TALK TO ME. ABOUT HOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING RID OF PROP FORTY SEVEN BUT I LOOKED AT IS HOW TO MAKE PROP FORTY SEVEN BETTER. AND THAT IS THE APPROACH. I THINK IF YOUR BILL HAD GONE IN THAT DIRECTION- I WOULD BE TOTALLY IN SUPPORT OF THAT HOW DO WE MAKE PROP FORTY SEVEN BETTER AND WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY UNFORTUNATELY THIS AGAIN BECAUSE THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER AS LIKE IT'S SUPPORTED TODAY MESSAGES FROM CHURCH RECOMMENDING AND THEN AND NAY VOTE INTO THAT. RIGHT TO START. BUT I THINK JUST. IS STILL. FOR SOME COLLAPSE AND I SAYING A WORD TO. SOME COOLER. EFFORT BECAUSE IF WE KEEP FIGHTING EACH OTHER ON BOTH ENDS. THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT BENEFIT OUR CRIMINALS IN THE MIDDLE. AS LIKE TO WARN PARENTS IN THE DIVORCE DEAL ARGUING ABOUT IT'S BEST FOR THE CHILDREN BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE HURTING THEIR CHILDREN WERE ARGUING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY FOR BOTH BANDS BUT IN THE MIDDLE. THE PUBLIC IS HEARD WE ARE HURTING THE PUBLIC ON BOTH SIDES AND WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO COME WITH. WITH LONG RANGE PLANS WHICH IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE PART WHICH YOU GOTTA HAVE SOME PATIENT IT TAKES TIME TO PEOPLE FOR DRUG MENTAL HEALTH. AND THEN JUST LOCKING THEM UP AND THROWING AWAY THE KEY. THAT DOESN'T. WORK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SOLVE LONG RANGE SO WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH WAYS. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC BUT AT THE SAME TIME SONG. THE PROBLEM WITH CRIME IN AMERICA. NOT PUSH IT INTO PRISONS INTO JAILS. OR INTO MENTAL INSTITUTIONS. SO DO WE HAVE A MOTION. I'LL MOVE IT. YOU MAY CALL THE ROLL ON AB FIFTEEN NINETY NINE BY SEVEN MEMBER KILEY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER NAY LACKEY LACKEY I BONTA NAY BONTA NAY BRIAN NAY BRYAN NAY STONE.

WITH THE TWO BILLS AB SIXTEEN NINETY EIGHT AB SEVENTEEN HUNDRED- WHICHEVER ONE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH STARTING WITH. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED IN THE PALACES AND THANKING YOU. MISTER CHAIR. BEST FOR EIGHTY SIXTEEN NINETY EIGHT CORRECT THE- AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL PORCH PIRACY HAS LONG BEEN AN ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA THE RATE OF THEFTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AT PARTICULARLY NOW AS CONSUMERS RELY MORE AND MORE HEAVILY ON ONLINE SHOPPING. LAST YEAR AN ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS MILLION PACKAGES WENT MISSING FROM DOORSTEPS NATIONWIDE AND 64% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY'VE BEEN A VICTIM OF PACKAGE THAT. FIRST PARRIS HAVE BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED AND ORGANIZED SOME EVEN RESORTING TO RENTING U. HAUL TRUCKS AND FOLLOWING DELIVERY OF ANSWER NEIGHBORHOODS. AB SIXTY NINETY EIGHT RECOGNIZES THE GROWING PROBLEM OF RESIDENTIAL PACKAGE THAT BY CLASSIFYING IT AS ITS OWN CRIME AND ALLOWING FOR A PENALTY OF UP TO ONE YEAR IN COUNTY JAIL OF PACKAGE THEFT IS COMMITTED. IN CONCERT WITH ONE OR MORE PERSONS. WITH ME AT TODAY AND AT TESTIFIED TELEPHONICALLY IN SUPPORT IS A LEASE OUR CITY OF KANO WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND BRUCE MACRAE WITH UPS. ARE YOU A FAMILY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THESE ARE CITY AKON NOW WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT OF AB. NINETY EIGHT AS AMENDED. CITIES HAVE SEEN THE RISE PACKAGE THAT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUING A STATE HOME ORDER IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. CONSUMERS THINK. SHIFTED THEIR SHOPPING HABITS ILLUSTRATING RECORD BREAKING ONLINE SALES AND OF COURSE DELIVERY. ORDING TO A TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT CALIFORNIA CITIES ACCOUNTED 430% OF ALL STOLEN PACKAGES THROUGHOUT THE NATION. SAN FRANCISCO TOPPED THE LIST FOR THE CITY WITH THE MOST PACKAGE THAT'S WITH LOS ANGELES AND SACRAMENTO AMONG THE TOP TEN. ADDITIONALLY ACCORDING TO A TWENTY TWENTY SURVEY BY LENDING TREE. ONE IN FIVE AMERICANS REPORTED BEING VICTIMS OF PACKAGE THAT AMID THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS. WITH 18% HAVING THE PACKAGE OR DELIVERY STOLEN SINCE MARCH OF THAT YEAR. MULTIPLE PACKAGE THAT IN THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTH. AND 33% KNEW SOMEONE WHO HAD HAD A PACKAGE STOLEN DURING QUARANTINE. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE BEHAVIOR RESIDENTS HAVE HAD TO BEAR THE COST OF INSTALLING HOME CAMERAS IN HOPES OF COMPENSATING FOR THE LACK OF AVAILABLE ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES. STILL BE ISSUES PROCESS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY STATING THAT THE STRATEGY IS ONE OF MANY SUPPORTED BY COUNTIES IN ADDRESSING CRIME AND ITS UNDERLYING CAUSES. I CALIFORNIANS HAD PUT AN END TO IT IN RECENT YEARS TIME ADVOCATING FOR IMPROVED SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. WE REMAIN INTERESTED IN ENGAGING ON IMPROVEMENTS TO CALIFORNIA'S CULTURAL SYSTEM INTERRUPTING AN ENDING CYCLE OF RECIDIVISM AND BUILDING A COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEM OF CARE APPROPRIATE FOR MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

CAN NOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MISTER FRED WILLIAMS. REALLY OKAY DEDICA. YOUR UP. GOOD MORNING DENIGRATE ARM ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S UP OFFICE AT IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS AMENDED WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE AMENDMENTS AND NOTE THAT THEY DO MITIGATE MANY OF OUR INITIAL CONCERNS BUT WE STILL MUST OPPOSE. A STANDARD PRACTICE WE OPPOSE THE CREATION OF NEW CRIMES BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT MORE CRIMES AND HARSHER PUNISHMENT ARE NOT THE SOLUTION TO OUR SHARED SOCIETAL PROBLEMS. SPECIFICALLY AS DETAILED IN THE IN COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE CONDUCT THIS BILL TARGETS IS ALREADY CRIMINAL COVERED BY APPROXIMATELY EIGHT DIFFERENT PENAL CODE SECTIONS. WHICH SUPPORTS OUR ASSERTION THAT OF CRIMINALIZATION WAS THE SOLUTION WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY SOLVED THIS PROBLEM. HAVING TO BE A DIFFERENT CRIME UNDER DIFFERENT CODE SECTION IS NOT GOING TO HAVE THE INTENDED ADDITIONAL IMPACT INSTEAD AB SIXTEEN NINETY EIGHT PROPOSES DOUBLING PUNISHMENT. FOR EXACTLY THE SAME ACT SIMPLY BECAUSE MORE THAN ONE PERSON WAS INVOLVED. THIS WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY EVIDENCE IT WILL DETER THESE KINDS OF ACTS AND AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SAYS SIMPLY EXPLAINS- THE EVIDENCE ACTUALLY SUGGESTS THE CONTRARY. THIS BILL DOESN'T GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT MORE TOOLS IT JUST GIVE THEM A BIGGER BACK AND THAT BACK IS ALWAYS USED MOST AGAINST THE COMMUNITIES WE REPRESENT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING POVERTY THIS BILL TO EXPLORE OTHER SOLUTIONS TO THEIR STATED GOALS OF INTERRUPTING AND ENDING CYCLES OF RECIDIVISM AND BUILDING A COMMUNITY BASED. SYSTEM OF CARE APPROPRIATE FOR MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES TO CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT INCARCERATION. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AT ANY TIME THANK YOU.

THE BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO MAINTAIN AN INTERNET WEBSITE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING REPORTS OF POTENTIAL STOLEN GOODS THE BILL FURTHER REQUIRES TECH PLATFORMS THAT ALLOW FOR THE BUYING AND SELLING OF GOODS TO PROPERLY DISPLAY A LINK TO THIS REPORTING LOCATION ON THEIR WEBSITES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS.

OUR COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN NATIONAL CONVERSATIONS- TO ADDRESS ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME INCLUDING AND CONVERSATIONS WITH A LEGISLATORS- IN THIS BODY. AND ARE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL RETAILERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DEVELOP A UNIFIED STRATEGY TO PREVENT AND PROSECUTE THE STAFFS- IT'S ALREADY AN INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICE- TO HAVE A REPORTING MECHANISM FOR USERS TO REPORT SUSPICIOUS LISTINGS AND GOODS- MARKETPLACES USE THESE REPORTS. TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST ACCOUNTS THAT TRAFFIC IN STOLEN GOODS AND CLICK TO REPORT EVIDENCE- IN ORDER. TO PROVIDE THAT TO THE PROPER LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES- HOWEVER A. B. C. SEVENTEEN HUNDRED WILL DIVERT THOSE REPORTS ALREADY OCCURRING- FROM OUR COMPANY SITES TO THE PROPOSED ATTORNEY GENERAL SITE- WHICH WILL UNNECESSARILY DUPLICATE THESE EFFORTS- BY COMPILING REPORTS FROM THEIR OWN. MECHANISMS ARE COMPANIES CAN OFFICIALLY TAKE ACTION- COMPILE PERTINENT INFORMATION AND LIKE I SAID REFER IT TO PROPER LAW ENFORCEMENT- THIS BILL WILL COMPLICATE AND FRUSTRATE.

FIFTEEN WHO'S BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY AND I WANT TO THANK HER- HE'S PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT MORE ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY THIS YEAR WANTED TO HEAR. FOR ONE MORNING. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING SHARON MEMBERS I WANNA THANK BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN THIRTY. A BILL THAT TACKLES AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS ONE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. THOSE THAT ARE MENTALLY INCOMPETENT. THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY DOES TWO THINGS. ONE IT REMOVES THAT HE'D THE TENUOUS BURDEN FROM THE DEFENSE TO PROVE THAT THEIR CLIENT IS INCOMPETENT DESPITE HAVING THE DIAGNOSIS FROM THE COURT APPOINTED PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST. AND TO IT PROTECTS INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY DEEMED INCOMPETENT FROM STANDING TRIAL IN TOWN COMPETENCY IS OFFICIALLY RESTORED. CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT A DEFENDANT IS COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL FOR A CRIMINAL CHARGE. COMPETENCY INVOLVES AN ACCUSED PERSON BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCEEDINGS AND PLAY A ROLE IN HIS OR HER DEFENSE. ALTHOUGH A QUESTION OF MENTAL COMPETENCE SUSPENSE ALL COURT PROCEEDINGS FOR DEFENDANT DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL MAY STILL BE PROSECUTED EVEN IF THEIR COMPETENCE WAS NEVER RESTORED. UNFORTUNATELY A PREVIOUS RULING BY ONE SHIRT JUDGE THAT DETERMINED THE DEFENDANT WAS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. ISN'T CONSIDERED IF A DEFENDANT APPEARS BEFORE A DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA JUDGE EVEN WHEN COMPETENCE RESTORATION WAS NEVER ESTABLISHED. IN ADDITION UNDER EXISTING LAW FROM A COURT CASE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX BEFORE I WAS EVEN BORN. EVEN WHEN THE COURT APPOINTED PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST STATE THAT THE DEFENDANT IS INCOMPETENT THE COURT MUST STILL PRESUMED THAT THE DEFENDANT IS MENTALLY COMPETENT AND THE DEFENDANT'S ATTORNEY MUST PROVE BY QUOTE A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE. THAT THE DEFENDANT TRULY IS MENTALLY INCOMPETENT. COMPETENCY PROCEEDINGS ARE THE ONLY CALIFORNIA CIVIL COMMITMENT PROCEEDING WHERE THE PERSON SUBJECT TO INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT. MUST PROVE THAT THEY ARE MENTALLY ILL IN ORDER TO RECEIVE NECESSARY TREATMENT. THIS LEADS TO A DISPROPORTIONATE INCARCERATION FOR VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND OTHER UNDER RESOURCE GROUPS WHO CANNOT AFFORD BAIL AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO ACCESS TREATMENT. THIS BILL WOULD SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO THE STATE TO PROVE A DEFENDANT IS COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL WHEN A COURT APPOINTED EXPERT INDICATES THE DEFENDANT IS INCOMPETENT. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE A PSYCHIATRIST OR PSYCHOLOGIST EXAMINING THE DEFENDANT'S COMPETENCE TO STAND TRIAL TO ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT IS ELIGIBLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. THIS BILL WOULDALSO REQUIRE INFORMATION. THAT IS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE STATE SUMMARY CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION. THE BILL ESTABLISHES THAT IF A PERSON COULD NOT BE RESTORED TO COMPETENCY THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE RELEVANT IN DETERMINING THE PERSON'S MENTAL COMPETENCY AND SUBSEQUENT CRIMINAL CASE UNLESS THE DEFENDANT HAS PARTICIPATED IN MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION ONE ZERO ZERO ONE POINT THREE SIX OR HAD THEIR CHARGES DISMISSED AT THE END OF THE PERIOD OF DIVERSION. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY IS SPONSORED BY SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING TEAM JUSTICE SAN DIEGO. THERE'S OF THE COMMUNITY SHOWING UP FOR RACIAL JUSTICE SAN DIEGO UPRISE THEATER AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER ASSOCIATION. AND HAS A SUPPORT FROM ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION.

STATE HOSPITAL AND PRISON MOST RECENTLY JEREMY SAT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR NINE MONTHS I'M MEDICAID BEFORE HE WAS FOUND INCOMPETENT. TO STAND TRIAL IN SAN DIEGO. BEING SPENT THREE MORE MY- IN. GOOD STILL ON MEDICAID. AWAITING A BAD AND PAT STATE HIG IN DECEMBER IN. ONE WEEK AT HIS ARRIVAL AT THE STATE HOSPITAL NEAR ME PLAYED GUILTY TO AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED THE VERY FIRST DAY YOU'RE RIGHT AT THE STATE HOSPITAL. INTERLINK COMPETENCY TO STAND TRIAL. AND THE PATTON STATE HOSPITAL IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S LIKE IT NEVER EVEN EXISTED JEREMY ARRIVED AT PENN STATE HOSPITAL AFTER NEARLY A YEAR IN JAIL WITHOUT MEDICATION NO CONTINUITY OF CARE BUT MY SON WAS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IN SAN DIEGO HE WAS MOST DEFINITELY INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IN DECEMBER TO DINO. AS HIS MOTHER IS HOPEFUL AND THEY NEED TO SEE MY SON RIGHT BEING VIOLATED IN A COURT OF LAW AND CONSEQUENCES CAN BE ADDITIONAL YEARS IN PRISON FOR HIS CONDITION CAN ONLY BE FURTHER EXACERBATED IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL IT SEEMS TO ME THE SYSTEM IS IN HUMANE PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS ARE HUMAN BEINGS THEY DESERVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS ANYONE ELSE INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS AND THE RIGHT TO BE MENTALLY TREATED. WITH MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TO BE RESTORED THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING. ME TO SHARE THIS. THANK YOU THE NET. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NICK STEWART OATEN AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AS A SPONSOR OF AB SIXTEEN THIRTY. YEAH IT'S NO SECRET MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT CALIFORNIA DESPITE SOME OF OUR RECENT ADVANCES CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FISHING CARE TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR SIBLINGS PARENTS AND CHILDREN LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS- ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IS MY BROTHER- WHO REMAINS IN STATE PRISON- DESPITE NUMEROUS SUICIDE ATTEMPTS THAN A LONGSTANDING DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER. FOR DECADES INSTEAD INVESTING IN TREATMENT BEDS AND PERSONNEL WE SIMPLY FUNNELED OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS INTO CRIMINAL COURT RELYING ON JAILS AND PRISONS TO DO THE JOB OF DOCTORS AND TREATMENT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT METHOD USED TO IDENTIFY CALIFORNIANS WITH THE MOST SEVERE FORMS OF MENTAL DISORDERS. THE TENTATIVE ILLNESSES ARE SO SEVERE THAT THEY ARE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. CURRENTLY COMPETENCY PROCEEDINGS OF THE ONLY CALIFORNIA CIVIL CMMITMENT PROCEEDINGS FOR THE PERSON SUBJECT TO THE INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT MUST PROVE THAT THEY ARE MENTALLY ILL IN ORDER TO BE HOSPITALIZED AND RECEIVE NECESSARY TREATMENT. BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STATUTORY TIMELINES TO CONDUCTING THIS EVALUATION IT IS NOT UNCOMMON IN FACT IS FREQUENT FOR SEVERELY ILL CALIFORNIANS REMAIN IN JAIL CELLS FOR MONTHS- WAITING FOR TRIAL TO BE CONDUCTED AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE TO FROM WHAT INDEPENDENT EXPERTS OF ARE DETERMINED. THAT THEY ARE IN FACT TOO ILL TO STAND TRIAL. EIGHTY SIXTY THIRTY WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA'S COMPETENCY PROCESS COMMITMENT PROCEDURES BY SHIFTING THE BURDEN TO THE STATE. TO PROVE THE DEFENDANT INCOMPETENT WHEN INDEPENDENT COURT APPOINTED EXPERT HAS ALREADY FOUND THAT THEY'RE NOT. THE PROCESS ENACTED BY SIXTEEN THIRTY IS CONSISTENT WITH BEST MEDICAL PRACTICE AND HAS ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED BY RED AND BLUE STATES ALIKE INCLUDING IN WYOMING NEBRASKA NEW YORK DELAWARE ILLINOIS IS- AND A DOZEN OTHERS. THE SECOND PART OF AB SIXTEEN THIRTY WOULD WHEN A PERSON IS NOT A CONTENT TO STAND TRIAL AND NOT RESTORED TO COMPETENCY TRANSMITTED INFORMATION DEPARTMENT JUSTICE FOR INCLUSION IN THAT PERSON'S CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION. BY PROMOTING THE SHARING OF RELEVANT MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATION ACROSS COUNTY LINES CALIFORNIA FROM THE INFORMED JUSTIN MEDICALLY ACCURATE OUTCOMES FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS. THE FISCAL HUMAN COSTS PROLONGED COMPENSATED TERMINATIONS AND LATE ACCESS TO TREATMENT IMMEASURABLE WITH DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ON- POOR FOLKS OF COLOR. WITH THIS IN MIND WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF MODERNIZING AT LEAST ONE SMALL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL. HEALTH SYSTEM THANK YOU ANY ENTERED. AND IS SUPPORT. OF THE BILL. A SIXTEEN THIRTY.

GOOD MORNING MEMBERS NICE TO BE HERE IN PERSON AFTER SO LONG MY NAME IS KIM STONE WITH STONE ADVOCACY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN RESPECTFUL- OPPOSITION CALIFORNIA CASE LAW HAS LONG HELD THAT THE DEFENDANT IS PRESUMED TO BE MENTALLY COMPETENT UNLESS THAT DEFENDANT PROVES OTHERWISE- JUDGES ARE REQUIRED UNDER PEOPLE VERSUS WHAT DRIVE TO VALUATE THE COMPETENCY OF THE DEFENDANT IF EVIDENCE REQUIRES THAT THIS BILL UPENDS THAT PRESUMPTION SO THAT IF DEFENDANT ONCE FOUND INCOMPETENT WOULD BE FOREVER PRESUMED TO MAINTAIN THAT INCOMPETENCE REGARDLESS OF ANY OF RECOVERY OR TREATMENT THAT THAT DEFENDED MAY- HAVE. OCCURRED THE FINDING OF INCOMPETENCE DOESN'T MEAN THAT A DEFENDANT COULDN'T BENEFIT FROM MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT INCOMPETENCE MEANS THAT THE DEFENDANT IS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE CHARGES AND UNABLE TO ASSIST IN THEIR DEFENSE- THIS BILL- THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS FEAR THAT THIS BILL WILL TAKE RESOURCES- FROM POTENTIAL ALREADY SCARCELY SORT RESOURCES FROM POTENTIAL TREATMENT- TOWARDS EVALUATION AND WILL REDUCE.

THIS PROPOSITION ALSO CONTAIN LANGUAGE THAT REDUCED SEVERAL PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CANNABIS VIOLATIONS THESE REDUCTIONS WERE MEANT TO BE RETROACTIVE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA ENACTED LEGISLATION MEANT TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BY WHICH INDIVIDUALS COULD GET THEIR RECORDS AUTOMATICALLY REDUCED DISMISSED OR SEALED FOR ALL OFFENSES THAT HAVE BEEN DECRIMINALIZED UNFORTUNATELY IN TWENTY TWENTY TO IMPLEMENTATION REMAINS INCOMPLETE CURRENTLY THE STATUTE LACKS A CERTAIN DEADLINES TO ENSURE THE COMPLETION OF THE PROCESS THIS HAS RESULTED IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS NOT RECEIVING THE RELIEF. THEY WERE PROMISED TO REMEDY THE INEQUITY AB SEVENTEEN OH SIX SUCH A FIRM TIME LINE FOR COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S LOCAL COURTS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO COMPLETE THE WORK OF PROCESSING PAST CANNABIS CONVICTIONS DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR AUTOMATIC SEALING. AB SEVENTY NO SIX PROVIDES CLEAR DEADLINES GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THE JOB DONE RIGHT THIS TIME. THIS THERE'S NO REASON WHY IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE LEGAL RELIEF TO WHICH THEY WERE FIRST PROMISED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AB SEVENTEEN OH SIX ALLOWS PEOPLE TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES WITHOUT SERVING THE LIFE SENTENCE OF COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES FROM HAVING A CRIMINAL HISTORY.

OUR GOAL IS SECURING FULL FREEDOM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN CRIMINALIZED BY CANNABIS SPECIFICALLY THROUGH RESENTENCING RELEASE AN AUTOMATIC RECORD CLEARANCE. AS THE US MOVES AWAY FROM THE CRIMINALIZATION OF CANNABIS GIVING RISE TO A MAJOR NEW INDUSTRY THERE REMAINS THE FUNDAMENTAL INJUSTICE INFLICTED UPON THOSE WITH CANNABIS CRIMINAL RECORDS RELATED TO BEHAVIOR THAT YOU AND I CAN NOT ONLY FREELY ENGAGE IN TODAY.

AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL BEING HELD BACK FROM THE LIVES THEY DESERVE TO LIVE FROM RECEIVING THE RELEASE THEY ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR UNDER THE LAW.

WITHOUT THIS BILLS NECESSARY FIX TO THE RECORD SEALING STATUTE OUR STATE WILL CONTINUE TO FAIL THE VERY COMMUNITIES WHO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE WAR ON DRUGS TO THIS DAY OF PROHIBITION AND MAKE LEGALIZATION ACCESSIBLE TO ALL RESIDENTS THE ONUS MUST BE ON THE GOVERNMENT TO REMOVE THESE ERRONEOUS CONVICTIONS FROM PEOPLE'S RECORDS.

THE SEATTLE YOU MAY BEGIN I THANK YOU AUDIBLE CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COLLABORATING ON THIS BILL WITH ME- TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE. OF THE BILL. CALIFORNIA LAW DEFINES TRAFFICKING AS DEPRIVING ARE VIOLATING THE PERSONAL LIBERTY OF ANOTHER WITH THE INTENT. TO OBTAIN FORCED LABOR SERVICES PROGRAM PROCURER OR SELL THE INDIVIDUAL FOR COMMERCIAL SEX OR EXPLOIT THE INDIVIDUAL IN AN OBSCENE MANNER. CURRENT LAW CLASSIFIES ALL CASES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS A REGULAR FELONY HUMAN TRAFFICKING ARE THE SAME I'M SPEAKING OF COURSE ABOUT CHILD TRAFFICKING. UNLESS YOU'VE ACTUALLY SEEN IT. WISE I HAVE- IT'S HARD TO GET IT GET YOUR ARMS AROUND HOW ATROCIOUS THIS IS AND WHAT THE EFFECT IS ON THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE VICTIMS. CHILD TRAFFICKING CASES IN PARTICULAR SAW SHARP RISE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO I DO SHOW THAT THE CHILDREN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ARE INCREASED RISK OF SECONDARY INJURY SEXUAL ASSAULT INFECTIOUS DISEASES. SUBSTANCE MISUSE MALNUTRITION MAJOR DEPRESSION ANXIETY POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND SUICIDE IT'S HARDLY A WAY FOR THEM TO SET UP BEING SUCCESSFUL AS A AN ADULT. AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHAT ELEVATE THE CRIME OF CHILD TRAFFICKING TO BEING CLASSIFIED AS A SERIOUS FELONY AS OPPOSED TO ITS CURRENT. CLASSIFICATION AS A REGULAR FELONY. ELEVATING THIS TO A SERIOUS FELONY WOULD PROHIBIT PLEA BARGAINING AND PROVIDE A FIVE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT ON TOP OF THE COURTS SENTENCE FOR EACH PREVIOUS SERIOUS FELONY COMMITTED. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY CEO PRESIDENT AND CO FOUNDER OF THREE STRANDS GLOBAL FOUNDATION. ASHLEY ARE BRIAN TO TALK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND I BELIEVE SHE'S ON THE LINE. I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES MY BRYANT BEGAN BUT NEVER OKAY. YES THANK YOU AND CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ASHLEY BRYANT AND THE CO FOUNDER PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THREE STRANDS GLOBAL FOUNDATION ORGANIZATION IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ANTI TRAFFICKING WORK STRUCK PREVENTION EDUCATION AND TRAINING. AND CURRICULUM AS WELL AS OUR DIRECT SERVICES PROGRAMMING OVER THE PAST TWELVE YEARS I HAVE LED THREE STRANDS GLOBAL FOUNDATION WITH A DELIBERATE FOCUS ON PREVENTION PREVENTION IS THE TACTIC THAT GOES UPSTREAM TO STOP THE CRIME OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING BEFORE IT STARTS. PROTECT OUR PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAM HAS REACHED OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND ADULT AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND YOU ACROSS SIX STATES HEY I'M QUICKER THAN POWER PROGRAM HAS REACHED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SURVIVORS. AND IRIS CLIENTS IN SACRAMENTO AND SAN FRANCISCO. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS THE EXPLOITATION OF HUMAN THROUGH FORCE FRAUD AND COERCION FOR THE PURPOSES OF A COMMERCIAL SEX OR FORCED LABOR FOR THE BENEFIT. OF THEIR TRAFFICKERS ACCORDING TO THE ILO INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION THERE ARE TWO MILLION CHILDREN GLOBALLY THAT ATTRACTED EVERY YEAR INCLUDING AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND UNITED STATES. HEY HUMAN TRAFFICKING HIDES IN PLAIN SIGHT IT IS A CRIME THAT GENERATE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION GLOBALLY. IT IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING AND MOST LUCRATIVE IN SERIOUS CRIME TRAFFICKERS PREY ON ARE VULNERABLE AND BECAUSE THEY DID NOT STOP THEIR TACTICS. CALIFORNIA IS ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING BECAUSE OF FACTORS SUCH AS LARGE A LARGE RUNAWAY FOSTER. AND HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION A LARGE ECONOMY PROXIMITY TO INTERNATIONAL BORDERS. SIGNIFICANT IMMIGRATION POPULATION DIVERSE YOUTH POPULATION EXCEPT TRY IN TWENTY TWENTY MORE REPORTS WERE MADE TO THE NATIONAL. TRAFFICKING HOTLINE THAN ANY OTHER STATE COMMENT FROM CALIBER IN CALIFORNIA 20% OF THOSE INVOLVED AT LEAST ONE MINOR. CALIFORNIA HAS THE TOP THREE CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND SECOND PLEASE GOING CAN YOU GO. THEY'RE ALL HUMAN TRAFFICKING. OF ARGUES. I THREE TRANSFER FUNDING WE HAVE THE HONOR WORKING IN SCHOOL WITH AS- AND ARE USED TO PROVIDE TRAFFIC. AND FOR HE ALL TOO OFTEN A THE X. OF MINOR BOTH ON MY AND IN PERSON. IN FACT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN REPORTED IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT AND THAT TO THEIR CYBER TIP LINE THAT THEY RECEIVED MORE THAN TWENTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION REPORT UP FROM SIXTEEN POINT NINE NINE YOUR PART IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THOSE REPORTS IN TWENTY TWENTY. ON THE PUBLIC AND TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION WERE FROM ELECTRONIC SERVICE PROVIDERS. REPORTS OF ONLINE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF ARE YOU. MORE THAN DOUBLED IN TWENTY TWENTY OUR CHILDREN ARE TARGETS OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE EMPLOYED WITHIN POWER PROGRAM SERVED A HUNDRED AND FORTY CLIENTS. IN SACRAMENTO 77% OF OUR CLIENTS WORK ON FOSTER YOU AND 79% OF OUR CLIENTS WERE SURVIVORS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION PLEA BARGAINING PLEA BARGAINS ARE COMMONLY USED TO SAVE TIME AND EXPENSE AND AVOID THE UNCERTAINTY OF A TRIAL. EDA ALSO DEFINES THE ROLE OF THE PROSECUTOR STATING THAT THE WORK IS TO INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY BY PURSUING APPROPRIATE CRIMINAL CHARGES APPROPRIATE SEVERITY THE PROSECUTOR SHOULD TAKE TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT AND CONVICT THE GUILTY. CONSIDER THE INTERESTS OF VICTIMS AND WITNESSES AND RESPECT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL RIGHTS OF ALL PERSONS INCLUDING SUSPECTS AND DEFENDANTS. IN SOME CASES IT'S POSSIBLE FOR A PROSECUTOR TO DO BOTH OF THESE THINGS BUT SIMILARLY TO OTHER CRIMES INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS FELONIES THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN CHILD TRAFFICKING. A PLEA BARGAIN AND THE RE QUALIFICATION OF THE FENCES THAT OFTEN COMES WITH IT THE TRACKS FROM THE TRUE NATURE OF THE TANIS CRIME. THERE CANNOT BE TWO SIDES BY DEFINITION IT IS NOT A CRIME AND THEN POLLSBUT ONE OF KNOWLEDGE. WE KNOW FROM PERPETRATORS THAT THEY USE ONLINE AND IN PERSON GROOMING TACTICS FRAUDULENT PROMISES FOR A BETTER FUTURE OR EVEN PARTNERING FOR BASIC NECESSITIES TO PREY UPON VULNERABLE CHILDREN. WITH EXPLICIT IN TENSION OF RECEIVING SOMETHING IN RETURN. OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS I'VE SPENT ENDLESS HOURS WITH SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE STORIES I'VE HEARD THE PAIN I'VE WITNESSED THE BROKEN LINES I'VE SEEN ARE ALL BEYOND DESCRIPTION. THE IMPACT AND THEIR ABUSERS AFTER WILL EXTEND THROUGH THE SURVIVORS LIFETIME THIS IS NOT THE SPACE TO SAVE TIME OR RESOURCES. FOR A PROSECUTOR TO CONSIDER A BARGAIN WITH OFFENDERS TO HAVE DELIBERATELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CLASSES AMONG IS DISMISSIVE. OF THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF THE VICTIM AT BEST. BUT CAN BE BETTER DESCRIBED AS NEGLIGENCE IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO BOTH INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY AND PROTECT YES THAT. WE MUST CONFRONT THE CRIME AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHEREVER WE SEE IT AND PUNISH THOSE WHO COMMITTED A SERIOUS CRIME. TRAFFICKER SHOULD NOT FULLY ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF A PEACEFUL SOCIETY. UNTIL THEY'RE WILLING TO HOLD THEMSELVES IT'S ALL THE DAMAGE THEY HAVE CAUSED. THE MARK EVAN SOCIETY WE HAVE THE TO REMEDY THE PAIN OF THIS CRIME IF AT ALL. WHEN I ARISES IN TAKE ACTION AND THIS IS AFTER A. B. SIXTEEN FIFTY FIVE IMPROVE THE PROCESS. RESPONSE TO CHILD TRAFFICKING IN PER THE PROTECTION VICTIMS IN POTENTIAL OF. ALLOWING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAINTAIN ITS STANDING AS A LEADER IN THE ANTI TRACKING SPACE AND ENSURING THAT WE DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

MISTER CHAIR FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AT THIS TIME PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO PRESS ONE ZERO SIGNAL THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. TO CHAIR NO ONE IS SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK GOOD MORNING AGAIN GOOD MORNING THIS WORK- GEORGE ON TH I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION TO AB. SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE. AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE OPPOSED TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING OF EITHER MINORS OR ADULTS. WE BELIEVE THAT INCREASING PENALTIES IS A FAILED POLICY THAT HAS NEITHER DETERRED CRIME NOR PREVENTED FUTURE VICTIMS AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE IN PARTICULAR IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THE UMAN TRAFFICKING ONE NOW ALREADY PROVIDES FOR SUBSTANTIAL STENSON STREET PRISON EIGHT FOURTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS. IN SOME INSTANCES FIVE EIGHT OR TWELVE YEARS AND OTHERS AND IN CASES INVOLVING A MINOR WITH DURESS IS PUNISHABLE BY FIFTEEN YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON. AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE DOES NOTHING TO SOLVE THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS IN OUR SOCIETY WHICH WE TO STATE SEX TRAFFICKING. INSTEAD WE ASK YOU. TO ADOPTS A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AND FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE RESEARCHERS THAT YOU HEARD FROM LAST MONTH FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOLD SCHOOL OF LAW. WHO WERE PART OF YOUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AND THEY SAID. THAT THEIR STUDY FOUND THAT THE UNITED STATES OVER RELIED ON LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A RETRIBUTIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM APPROACH TO ADDRESS. COMPLEX SOCIETAL ISSUES THAT INSTEAD REQUIRE NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF TRAUMA RACE AND POVERTY. IN THEIR SEMINAL REPORT WHICH I THINK THEY MUST'VE REFERENCED THEY ASKED. FOR MOVING THEY SAID AFFECT OF ANTI TRAFFICKING EFFORTS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR USE OF OPERATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS AND FOCUSING INSTEAD ON COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES. AND INVESTING IN POVERTY RELIEF ANTI DISCRIMINATION INITIATIVES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT THE UNDERLYING CAUSES. AMONG THEIR SIX RECOMMENDATIONS OR SUPPORT COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY VICTIMS AND TRAFFICKERS OUTSIDE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SEVENTH SYSTEM THAT REDUCE THE VULNERABILITY OF POTENTIAL VICTIMS- I THINK ONE OF THE WITNESS THE WITNESS AND SUPPORT TALKED ABOUT FOSTER CHILDREN THEY ARE VULNERABLE AND MAY NEED ASSISTANCE INCREASED SERVICES AVAILABLE TO VICTIMS AND SYSTEMATICALLY OFFER COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES TO EVERY SUSPECTED VICTIM THESE ARE PROVEN EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES. AND LIKELY IN ORDER TO HELP THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND HUMAN IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING BY SUPPORTING THEIR PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES. YOU CAN MEET VICTIMS NEEDS AND I BELIEVE COMING BEFORE YOU IS THERE'S GOING TO BE A BUDGET ASK FOR HOUSING. FOR SEX WORKERS AND FORMER SEX WORKERS WHO INCLUDE THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND MONIES. FOR A PILOT PROGRAM TO SUPPORT FIVE. TO TEN HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR UN HOUSED. AND CULTURALLY. ON COMPETENT SERVICES HOUSING IS ONE OF THE KEY NEEDS OF THIS COMMUNITY.

JUST OVERLOOKED AND TO SOME DEGREE DISMISSED AND I BELIEVE THAT BURKE WHAT THIS DOES THIS DOES NOT. RISE THE ISSUE- OF CRIME TO A VIOLENT FELONY WHICH IS WHEN I WOULD EVEN PREFER. IT GOES TO SERIOUS WHICH IS A STEP PRIOR TO WHICH MEANS IT DOESN'T COUNT AS A STRIKE- AND THE OTHER SOME OTHER VERY VERY POWERFUL. COMPROMISES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO MAKE THIS A US A SERIOUS FELONY VERSUS SAY A VIOLENT FELON AND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T ALLOW OF. PLEA BARGAINS IN THE SITUATION THAT'S ONE OF THE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS AT THIS BILL WILL ALLOW. BECAUSE WAIT WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT. THE WHERE'S OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM WORKS IN SENTENCING AND IT'S FOR THE OFFENSE YOU'RE CONVICTED OF AND THE MOST RECENT THAT YOU'RE CONVICTED OF NOT ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU DID WHICH YOU'RE CONVICTED OF WHICH OUR PLEA BARGAINS OVER 90% OF THE TIME. AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE HOLD THESE. UNIQUE OFFENDERS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR THEIR VERY- CRASS BEHAVIOR AND SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WILL BE STRONGLY SUPPORTING. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR CONTENT. SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THAT- SO WHATEVER IT IS A GIVEN THE TESTIMONY TODAY WHATEVER THAT ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE TO ADDRESS THIS. IN A DIFFERENT MANNER THEY'RE NOT WORKING- IF YOU WOULD GO OUT AND ANYONE YOUR COMMUNITIES YOU CAN FIND. HOUSING UNITS APARTMENTS CONDOMINIUMS- THAT THE ONLY. TOOLS ARE THE ONLY FURNITURE INSIDE OUR MATTRESSES ON THE FLOOR OF EACH BEDROOM EACH ROOM AND THOSE ARE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPLOITING CHILDREN THEY HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED HAVE BEEN DRUG AND HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THIS UNDER WORLD WORLD OF. STAY HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING OF CHILDREN. I HAVE SEEN IT. I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE IN HERE CAN SAY THAT THEY HAVE SEEN IT. AND EVERY TIME I SAW IT GONNA TRY TO TRY TO HELP THESE PEOPLE. HUMAN TO DRUG TRAFFICKING HUMAN TRAFFICKERS OF CHILDREN. ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS WHERE WE CAN REHABILITATE THEM THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE AND JUST FEED THEIR FAMILIES. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOWERED TO THIS BY MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. JUST LIKE DRUG DEALERS ONE MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THEIR USE IN OUR KIDS TO DO IT. THEY HAVE NO SOUL OF OUR KIDS AND RUINING THEIR FUTURES. BECAUSE WE WANT TO PUT THEM BACK OUT INTO SOCIETY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THIS BILL SAYS NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT AND AS MR LACKEY HASSAID IT DOESN'T TAKE IT TO THE HARSHEST PENALTY. ALTHOUGH I MAY AGREE WITH HIM. BUT IT TAKES ANOTHER STEP BECAUSE WHATEVER WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING AND IF YOU THINK FAILING ARE YOU THINK IT WAS FAILING BECAUSE OF THE INCARCERATION RATES FAN NO IT'S FAILING. BECAUSE THE BAD GUYS ARE OUT THERE TAKING THOSE KIDS AND PUTTING THEM IN THE POSITION THAT THE RAN WHERE THEY CAN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES THAT'S OUR JOB AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY AND THAT'S WHY I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON SIXTEEN.

INMATE WELFARE FUND. PLEASE I W. APPS SHOULD BE USED BY THE SHERIFF'S PRIMARILY FOR THE BENEFIT EDUCATION AND WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE INCARCERATION. THE CURRENT LAW ALLOWS DID ANY LEFT OVER FUNDS MAY GO TO FACILITIES MAINTENANCE SALARIES AND BENEFITS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY TO SHARE. BECAUSE THIS DISCRETION THE MANAGER OF THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF GRAND JURY IN CARS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SURE AN EVIDENCE I W. HATCH HAVE BEEN USED INAPPROPRIATELY. AS A RECENT EXAMPLE REPORTS LAST SUMMER FROM THE SACRAMENTO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT USED TO FUNDS TO PAY FOR TRIPS TO LAKE TAHOE RESORT AND OTHERFLIGHTS AND LODGING ASSOCIATED WITH CONFERENCES. ADDITIONALLY REPORTS HAVE CITED THAT IN SOME YEARS SALARIES AND MAINTENANCE HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR BETWEEN SIXTY SIX TO NINETY FROM SAID THREE PERCENT. OF THE MONEY SPENT FROM THE FUND. WHILE PROGRAMS THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT INCARCERATED PEOPLES SUCH AS THE LAW LIBRARY AND EDUCATION ACCOUNT FOR AT LEAST 31% WHEN THE FUNDS ARE INCREASINGLY SPENT TO BENEFIT. THE SHERIFF'S DISCRETION OVER THESE FUNDS ARE USED BEYOND THE SCOPE OF IMF'S ORIGINAL INTENT AND AT THE EXPENSE OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. BY REQUIRING THE FUNDS TO BE SPENT SOLELY NOT PRIMARILY FOR THE BENEFIT EDUCATION AND WELFARE OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING INCARCERATION AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL ENSURE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY OVER THESE BONDS THE BEST ENSURING A MORE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY OF INDIVIDUALS INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES.

MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS CORY CELLS ALONE WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO. AS THE AUTHOR SAID THERE ARE STATUTORY LIMITS ON HOW- THE PROCEEDS AND THE FUNDS THAT ARE IN THESE FUNDS CAN BE SPENT- THE PENAL CODE SECTION FOUR ZERO TWO FIVE IT'S BEEN VERY CLEARLY LAID OUT- WITHIN THAT SECTION THERE IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT THAT. THE SHARE FILE AN ANNUAL ITEMIZE REPORT TOTHE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS UPON THOSE EXPENDITURES. THE LAW ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE EDUCATION TREATMENT AND OTHER PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED BY THESE FUNDS- REQUIRE SUPPORT AND THEY REQUIRE STAFF TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN- AS WE NOTED IN OUR LETTER THIS CHANGE IS NOT DONE IN A VACUUM- JUST MONTHS AGO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TOOK ACTION TO CAPTURE ALL PHONE RATES ON INTRASTATE COLES. THIS CHANGE HAS AND WILL REDUCE THE FUNDING SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR THE IWS- I NOTE THIS BECAUSE WE SHOULD CONSIDER ALL OF THESE CHANGES POTENTIAL CHANGES TOGETHER. WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER THAT THE EXPECTATION OF JAILS AND SHERIFFS HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS CERTAINLY SINCE- THE ENACTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT. AND THOUGH THE STATE DOES PROVIDE FUNDING- TO THE COUNTIES- IN CONNECTION WITH THESE DUTIES COUNTIES TOOK OVER- SIGNIFICANT ROLE CHANGES- AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THE PROGRAMS FOR INCARCERATED PERSONS. WILL RECEIVE THESE FUNDS THAT COME FROM REALIGNMENT DEMAND FOR MORE PROGRAMS. CONTINUES TO RISE- WHILE THE STATE AND ITS VARIOUS FORM CONTINUES TO ELIMINATE RESOURCES AND FLEXIBILITY AND HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE SPENT. AGAIN THE LAW REQUIRES ANNUAL ITEMIZE REPORTS ON THE USE OF THESE FUNDS THIS FOSTERS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY- AND FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED CSSA MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THANK YOU.

THAT WAS STOLEN AS L. E. L. Y. FOR THE USE OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS LOSS FOR IN AND MAYBE IN SOME CASES. THE I DON'T EVEN USE THE WORD MISUSE BUT THAT THE USE OF IT THAT IS NOW DEEM INAPPROPRIATE IS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T CLARIFY IT CORRECTLY THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES MAKE IT VERY CLEAR.
