THAT REQUIRES PHLEBOTOMIST TO

00:59:13.516 --> 00:59:15.685

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.729
CLARIFIES THAT'S THE HOSPITAL

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.464
DOES HAVE TO PROVIDE TRAINING

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.232
FOR THE PHLEBOTOMIST IT IS THAT

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:05.201

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:03.746
BEGAN THAT OF MEDICAL

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.481
PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS NURSES

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:07.750
PHLEBOTOMIST AND DOCTORS. THE

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:10.619
SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS IMPLICATED

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.421
BY THE FILM. REGRETTABLY WE ARE

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:13.522
IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:15.057
OPPOSE THE LATEST ITERATION OF

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:16.559
THE BILL WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.260
TO THE LEGISLATURE BY SINGLE

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:19.495
HEALTHCARE DEVICE MANUFACTURER.

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.564
VILLADA VASCULAR WHOSE SOLE AIM

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.566

EFFECTIVELY IN CALIFORNIA. THE

SPONSORS HAVE NEVER DENIED THAT.

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:47.122
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PEOPLE

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.390
DEVICES ONLY A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.392

TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS COME AFTER.

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:31.373

ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT LIABILITY

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:46.922
LIABILITY WOULD BE ON THE

PHLEBOTOMIST AND THE HOSPITAL IF

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.192

TWO AND A HALF MILLION TIMES.

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.570
AND OVER HALF OF THOSE TIMES IT

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:04.406
WAS BY A PHLEBOTOMIST. SO DR DEF

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:08.577

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:10.445
MORE TO ADD TO THAT. WELL I'M

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:11.647
NOT REALLY OF THE SOME OF THE

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.582
CAPITAL BOTANIST LEARN IS. OF

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:14.750
THEIR CERTIFICATION IS DONE AND

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:16.351
BY IN FULL BOTTOM ME SCHOOL ARE

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.053
CONTROLLED BY THE STATE. AND

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.155
SOME OF IT IS ACTED ON BY THE

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:21.256
HOSPITAL FACILITIES IN THE

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:22.991
CURRENT WAY THE STATUTES ARE

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.126
WRITTEN. AND SO IT'S BOTH IT'S

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:25.460
KIND OF SPLIT DEPENDING ON WHAT

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.029
YOU HAVE TO LEARNING SO IT'S

01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:28.297
VERY COMMON FOR A LOT OF US TO

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:31.133

QUESTION MY NEXT QUESTION WAS

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:39.842
ABOUT THE LIABILITY BECAUSE-

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:40.976
THERE ARE LICENSURE

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:44.246
IMPLICATIONS. AND IT'S MY

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.881
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S NOT A

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.516
DOCTOR OR A NURSE THAT'S

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:48.150
RETURNING WHETHER PHLEBOTOMIST

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:49.551
ISSUES IT'S REALLY. AN

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:51.353
ADMINISTRATOR OF A HOSPITAL THAT

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.289

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.557
BACK TO THE LICENSOR

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.659
IMPLICATIONS WHAT. ARE THE

01:14:57.726 --> 01:15:00.462
IMPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE IF

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:01.563
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT GOES

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.232
AWRY. SO DOCTORS HAVE GONE DO

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:06.535
YOU MIND ANSWERING THAT. SURE OF

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.136
COURSE BOB SO FULL BOTTOM IS

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:09.738
WORK FOR THE LABORATORY IN THE

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:11.874

POSITION OF THE LABORATORY OF

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:17.746
THE HOSPITAL. SO THAT THAT WOULD

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:18.247
BE THE PERSON ULTIMATELY

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.482
RESPONSIBLE FIRST. OVERSEEING

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.484
THEM THE SUPERVISING THEM. SO

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.953
THEN IF A NURSE OR A DOCTOR IS

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.689
PRESENT AND AVAILABLE WHAT WOULD

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.825
BE THE BENEFIT FOR THE ADVANTAGE

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:32.094
OF USING A PHLEBOTOMIST OVER A

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.731
NURSE OR A DOCTOR. THERE IS NOT

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:37.399
NECESSARILY A BENEFIT IN IN

NURSES ARE NOT DOING THE BLOOD

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.504
DRAWS SO IF THERE IS A NURSE OR

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.172
A DOCTOR AVAILABLE NURSES ARE

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:46.408
ALREADY ALLOWED TO USE THESE
