THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE. TODAY RAINY HERE THE HIGHER READ MAY REVISED PROPOSALS TODAY'S. HEARING IS INFORMATIONAL ABOUT THE MAY REVISED PROPOSALS WE WILL NOT BE TAKING ANY ACTIONS TODAY WE'LL BE. WRAPPING UP OUR OUR OUR WORK NEXT WEEK BUT TODAY WE HEAR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FROM THE MAY REVISE -- HIGHER YOU SEE CSU COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN STATE COMMISSION. AS WELL AS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM RELATED TO THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH RELATED -- TO THE INNOVATION GRANTS SO LET'S START WITH THAT ISSUE NUMBER ONE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH REBEKAH KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME TO SUPPORT GRANTS TO K. TWELVE AND POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN AND INLAND EMPIRE REGIONS. IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL STRATEGIES. THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES MORE DETAILED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ON THIS PROPOSAL WHICH IN PART SPECIFIES THAT CONSIDERATION FOR THESE GRANTS WOULD PARTICULARLY EMPHASIZE PROGRAMS THAT BETTER ALIGNS SECONDARY AND POST SECONDARY PROGRAMS. ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. AND ARE CAPABLE OF CREATING A MULTI GENERATIONAL CULTURE OF EDUCATIONAL ENTERTAINING. EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. CHASING CONCENTRA SALLY L. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR AGENDA IT DESCRIBES IN MORE DETAIL BOTH A PROPOSAL AND ALSO THE SPECIFIC -- CHANGES THAT ARE MADE IN A REVISION. WE HAVE TO OVER ARCHING -- CONCERNS OF THIS PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL APPEARS TO SHARE A LOT OF THE SAME SHORTCOMINGS. WITH PREVIOUS -- HIGHER EDUCATION -- AB INNOVATION GRANT INITIATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IN PREVIOUS YEARS. AS A REMINDER THOSE PROGRAMS TENDED TO PROVIDE A LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS. TO INCOME IMPLEMENT LOCAL INITIATIVES WITHOUT A CLEAR PLAN FOR DISSEMINATING THAT THAT -- THOSE INNOVATIONS ARE ACROSS THE STATE. SECONDS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO DUPLICATE MANY OTHER MORE IMPACTFUL EFFORTS OF THE STATE HAS UNDERTAKEN IN RECENT YEARS. TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. THOSE -- EFFORTS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ADOPTING THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND START WISHING SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY -- CREATING -- A COMMUNITY COLLEGE% PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS STUDENT SUCCESS IN INCLUDING STUDENT SUCCESS AS A COMPONENT IN THE APPORTIONMENT FORMULA. pAUGMENTATIONS A TO CSU FOR ITS GRADUATION INITIATIVE. IN EACH OF THESE CASES EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO YOU TO ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS. AND TO USE THEM TO FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS AND IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. GIVEN THESE TWO CONCERNS WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT THAT WE NOTED IS THERE ARE. EXISTING PROGRAMS IN THAT STUDENT COMMISSION WHICH DO THIS WORK THE CAL SO PROGRAM IT'S NOT IN THE AGENDA WE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST. YEAR'S I'M FAMILIAR WITH IT FROM COUPLE DECADES BACK. IN SO -- WANTED TO ASK IF YOU WOULD RESPOND TO TO THAT AND WHY THE DUPLICATION AND RICK REINVENT THE WHEEL WHEN WE HAVE. EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN BEEN DOING JUST THIS -- TARGETING. HIGH SCHOOL POPULATIONS WITH LOW COLLEGE GOING RATES THAN HELPING THEM NAVIGATE THE COLLEGE MAYES. YES -- SO THE CAO ALSO PROGRAM WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THE VALUE IN THAT PROGRAM AND THOSE CONSORCIO THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- THIS PROPOSAL REVIEWING AS SORT OF A A COMPLIMENTARY PROPOSAL TO BOTH CAL SOAP IN THE OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE ALLEY OWES COMMENTS. THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S PRIORITIZE FOR THE TWO REGIONS INLAND EMPIRE. AND THE SAN JOAQUIN REGION OF THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AREAS WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION -- IN WHICH WE COULD REALLY USE SOME ADDITIONAL INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL STRATEGIES. ONE WAY IN WHICH THIS PROPOSAL IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE AS WELL IS THAT IT'S REALLY STIMULATING. INNOVATIVE IDEAS IN THESE PARTICULAR AREAS BOTH OF THE K. TWELVE OR POST SECONDARY LEVEL. AND WERE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THESE CHALLENGES SUCH AS ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND CREATING A MULTI CAR GENERATIONAL -- CULTURE OF COLLEGE ATTAINMENT. THOSE ARE CHALLENGING ISSUES THAT NECESSITATE A MULTI FACETED APPROACH SO WE DON'T SEE THE ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL IS NECESSARILY BEING DUPLICATIVE OR IN CONFLICT WITH THE OTHER EXISTING APPROACHES. I GUESS THE ONLY. CONCERN IS THAT. THIS IS AN OBVIOUS YET A BIG ISSUE -- AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A COUPLE DECADES IN. THE WE STEPPED UP A FEW YEARS AGO WITH THE UC WESTWOOD ACADEMIC OUT REACH PROGRAMS AND SAY PET PROGRAMS I GUESS THE COLUMN. AND WE PUT SOME MONEY IN THE STATE COMMISSION PROGRAMS NOW AND SO. WE KIND OF KNOW WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND THAT THIS -- YOU KNOW TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. SO WE DIDN'T THIS PROBABLY NOT WORTH EXPERIMENTING WITH ME NOW BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WORK ESPECIALLY IN THESE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE. THESE PROGRAMS AND SOME SOMETHING THAT WILL CONSIDER WITH THE FINAL ACTION SO THANK YOU. OKAY -- THANK YOU MUCH. WELL THIS ISSUE OPEN MISTER DOT. THANKS SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S TEN MILLION DOLLARS A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. DOLLARS -- FOR GRANTS TO EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN INLAND EMPIRE REGIONS WHAT EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. SPECIFICALLY THEY COULD BE K. TWELVE OR POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL AND SO IT'S NOT EVEN DEFINED YET AS TO WHO WOULD GET THEM. IT'S MORE FLEXIBLE CURRENTLY ANYONE WHO WOULD BE THE LEAD AGENCY. AT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCHWOULD BE ADMINISTERING THE GRANT FUNDS. WHY IS IT IN THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES? YES RIGHT INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. OF THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IDENTIFIES A FEW PRIORITIES SO BETTER ALIGNMENT OF SECONDARY AND POST SECONDARY PROP PROGRAMS. REDUCTION OF ACHIEVEMENT GAPS FURTHERING SUCCESS FOR ALL THE AREA AND A LOT OF MONEY FOR THAT NOW. YES THERE ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS SO JUST QUICKLY IS THAT WE HAVE. L. C. F. F. AT K. TWELVE IN THE NOW BEYOND THAT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL WE HAVE A SOMETHING THAT REFLECTS ALL SEE OF HAVE SO WHY WOULD BE. WHAT WOULD MORE MONEY DO? MY ONLY CONCERN IS DOESN'T SEEM REALLY DEFINED IT DON'T REALLY SEEM. THERE'S NO SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT. WHAT WHAT WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE ON THE GROUND OR EVEN EVEN THE OUTCOMES? IS A DEFINED HOW THE OUTCOMES WOULD BE MEASURED. AT THERE WERE THERE IS REPORTING LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HAVE. THE GRANT RECIPIENTS REPORT BACK TO THE PART OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE ON OUTCOMES THE RECIPIENTS OF THE GRANTS -- AS WELL AS SOME OUTCOME INFORMATION FOR STUDENT OUTCOMES. IT JUST SEEMS IS THIS SEEMS TO ME. MISTER CHAIR OF DISSOLVED ISSUE MY OPINION US JUST DOES SEEM CLEAR IS WHAT THE GOALS NUMBER. ONE IT SHOULD BE MORE SPECIFIC THE OUTCOMES. AND I'VE BEEN JUST IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S JUST TOSSING MONEY OTHERS HE WANTS TO GRAB IT QUITE FRANKLY. SO IN IN IN IF K. TWELVE ARE YOU REALLY LISTEN TEY COULD USE MORE MONEY. BE THE FIRST CHAMPION OF THAT IN THIS BODY BUT IF YOU JUST CAN OFFER A MONEY FOR SOMETHING THEY'RE ALREADY DOING. SHOULD WE OFFERED ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE. RIGHT SO THAT THE TWO AREAS FOR THIS PROPOSAL THE INLAND EMPIRE AND SAN JOAQUIN REGIONS WERE IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITIES BY THE ADMINISTRATION -- A FEW REASONS THAT LED TO THAT PRIORITIZATION INCLUDING REAL PERSONAL INCOME BEING LOWER IN THOSE AREAS THAN THEY ARE FOR THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT BEING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THOSE REGIONS THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. AND THEN ALSO WHILE THEY SEE -- INCREASING NUMBERS OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WERE SEEING LOWER THAN STATEWIDE AVERAGE NUMBER THAT MEET THE ADMISSIONS CRITERIA FOR UC AND CSU. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY AIMED AT JUST GENERATING -- AND INCENTIVIZING SOME INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES THAT K. TWELVE OR POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS MAY COME UP WITH IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER ENTITIES AS WELL -- AIMED AT AT ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES SO IT IS FOCUSED MORE AT IMPLEMENTING INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES THAT ARE NEW IDEAS. TO CREATE MORE OF A A MULTI GENERATIONAL COLLEGE ATTAINMENT -- CULTURE IN THOSE REGIONS AND TO GENERATE MORE COLLEGE ATTENDANCE GOT IT GOT IT WELL LISTEN I WAS FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. OR FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE. I UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD SUPPORT THIS BUT ALTHOUGH I'M NOT. I'M NOT SAYING THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA AS MUCH AS I'M SAYING THIS DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE FLUSHED OUT TO ME. AS SOON TO WHAT THE FULL INTENT IS BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THESE ISSUES NOW SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU AGAIN WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. LET'S PROCEED NOW WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND NAY REVISED PROPOSAL STUFF SKEWS ME FIRST. STATE LIBRARY. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES FOUR ITEMS OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY. THE FIRST IS DIGITAL CONCIERGE SERVICES AND CULTURAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION. MAY REVISION INCLUDES ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ON GOING. TO SUPPORT THREE POSITIONS THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A TEAM PROVIDING DIGITAL CONCIERGE ARCHIVAL SERVICES FOR STATE ENTITIES. AND TO ALLOW FOR COMMISSION OF A SURVEY TO INVENTORY CULTURAL HERITAGE ASSETS. WITH THESE FUNDS THE STATE LIBRARY WOULD BE ABLE TO PRESERVE IMPORTANT RECORDINGS GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS MAPS AND OTHER ITEMS CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE. AND CREATE A CENSUS OF RARE ITEMS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE HOUSING CARED FOR APPROPRIATELY. WOULD YOU LIKE THE TO HEAR THE OVERVIEW OF THE OTHER ITEMS OR SHIRT ON RECEIPT OKAY. AND THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME FOR THE STATE LIBRARY TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL LIBRARIES TO ACQUIRE BOOK MOBILES AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH VEHICLES. THIS WILL BE PRIORITIZE FOR LIBRARIES WITH LOW PER CAPITA LIBRARY SPENDING AND IN NEED FOR MOBILE SERVICES BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. AT THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME TO PROVIDE GRANTS FOR LOCAL LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS TO IMPLEMENT EARLY LEARNING AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. PRIORITIZE TO LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS WITH THE LOWEST PER CAPITA LACKEY SPENDING. ANIME REVISION INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND GENERAL FUND ONE TIME TO SUPPORT THE PRESERVATION OF HISTORICAL LGBT Q. SITES. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO. SO REVIEWING THESE PROPOSALS ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA. FROM WHAT WE IDENTIFIED A FEW CROSS CUTTING -- ISSUES TO CONSIDER AND ALL ALL WALK THROUGH A THREE OF THOSE ISSUES RIGHT NOW. THE FIRST ISSUE IS WHILE A NUMBER OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE ONE TIME -- THEY ARE UNDERSTANDING IS THERE THEY COULD THERE COULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS IN LATER YEARS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS. YOU MIGHT WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THOSE POTENTIAL OUT YOUR COSTS COULD BE. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS ONE OF THE PROPOSALS WOULD BE TO PROVIDE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE TIME TO START THE INITIAL STAGES OF DEVELOPING A STATE WIDE INVENTORY OF CULTURAL HISTORICAL ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A STEP FOR THE STATE LIBRARY NOTED THAT THE FUNDING MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO FULLY COMPLETE THE INVENTORY THIS COULD JUST SORT OF BE THE FOR THE FIRST STAGES OF OCT FOR MULTI YEAR EFFORT. THAT WOULD NOT ONLY DEVELOP THE INVENTORY BUT ALSO IDENTIFY LONG TERM STRATEGIES. TO PROTECT. RESOURCES DEEMED AT RISK OF DAMAGE OR OR LOSS. AND SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ADDITIONAL OUT YOUR COSTS ARE AND WHAT THE OVER ARCHING PLAN IS AS YOUR AS YOUR WEIGHING WHETHER OR NOT TO ADOPT THIS PROPOSAL. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF IT -- FOR ONE OF THE GRANT LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAMS FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. ARE THIS IS FUNDING ACTIVITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT LIBRARIES ARE PROVIDING AFTER SCHOOL SERVICES TO STUDENTS. AND SO THE QUESTION HERE IS -- HOW WITH THE LIBRARY SUSTAIN THOSE -- ACTIVITIES ON AN ONGOING BASIS IN LATER YEARS GIVEN THAT THIS IS ONE TIME FUNDING. A SECOND CONSIDERATION OF THAT WE RAISES THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSALS. WOULD HAVE. SOMEWHAT LIMITED BUDGET BILL. A LANGUAGE STATING HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED ANOTHER SORT OF PARAMETERS -- YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE LIBRARY WOULD ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU. STRONGER BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT SETS PARAMETERS FOR EXAMPLE HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE PRIORITIZED -- WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE GRANTS? AND THE THIRD FOR FOR EVERY SINGLE ITEM WE RECOMMEND -- REPORTING LANGUAGE -- AFTER APPROPRIATE IF YOU WERE TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A FACT OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ARE YOU COULD THE REPORTS COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE HOW THE FUNDS WERE SPENT. ON THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE -- THAT RESULTED FROM THE FUNDING AND WE WE CAN WE WE CAN WORK WITH STAFF ON ON CLARIFYING THAT LANGUAGE THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU STATE LIBRARY. THANKS GREG LOCUSTS FROM THE STATE LIBRARY -- MAIN CHASE -- NAY IS RIGHT THAT IF WE CONDUCT OR BEGIN TO CONDUCT A SURVEY OF CALIFORNIA'S CULTURAL ASSETS I MEAN THE SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED MSEUMS LIBRARIES GALLERIES ARCHIVES. HISTORICAL SOCIETIES IT'S LIKELY THAT'S GOING TO AND COVER THE SAME SORT OF ISSUES THAT ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LAST BUDGET ITEM TO HELP ARCHIVES FOR LGBT. Q. -- MATERIALS MAKE CALIFORNIA HAS. TWO OF THE THREE LARGEST ARCHIVES -- LGBT Q. ARCHIVES AND THEY FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES TO EVERY OTHER ARCHIVE AND THE STATE -- REPORTING. IF. HAPPY TO DO THAT -- BUT INCLUDED AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT AS AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW MULTIPLE DISCRETE REPORTS. THANK YOU ALL WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO LOOK AT IT IF IT WAS IN ONE DOCUMENT AS WELL. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'VE YET TO HEAR FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S AGE AND ABOUT THAT PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR ZIP BOOKS OKAY MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ON THE CASE. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY HEARING NONE THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OF IT THANK YOU. PROCEED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BUDGET PROPOSALS GOOD MORNING JESS WALTER FROM THE FINANCE -- IN ADDITION TO THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT MADE IN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAN A REVISION INCLUDES SEVERAL KEY INVESTMENTS. IN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- THE FIRST IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT UC'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES IN THE UC RETIREMENT PLAN. AT THE SECOND IS THREE POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR DYSLEXIA SCREENING PILOT OPERATED BY THE TO SO AT UCSF DYSLEXIA CENTER -- THE PILOT WILL LEVERAGE A A NEW APPLICATION. TO IDENTIFY LEARNING DISABILITIES EARLIER AND INTERVENE -- WE ARE. ALSO PROPOSING THREE POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR A RAPIDLY HOUSING AT THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA. AND THE MAYOR VISION PROVIDES ADDITIONAL CLARITY REGARDING THE USEOF THE ONGOING FIFTEEN MILLION -- GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS JUNE HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS. THESE USES INCLUDE FOOD PANTRIES CAL FEDERAL MEANT -- YOU'LL DONATION AND HOUSING SUPPORT -- WE ARE. ALSO PROPOSING LANGUAGE THAT WILL ALLOW THE CITY USE. FIVE MILLION OF THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND PROVIDED FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. TO CONDUCT A PLAN FACILITIES ASSESSMENT THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY ELIA. PAGE SIX OF YOUR GENDER DESCRIBES EACH OF THEM A REVISION PROPOSALS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO YOU SEE. OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE OUR MOST NOTABLE -- COMMENTS ARE ON THE FIRST THREE PROPOSALS. A RETIRED THE RIVER THE UC RP PROPOSAL DYSLEXIA AND RAPID RE HOUSING. I'M GOING TO ADDRESS THE FIRST TWO PROPOSALS ON IF IT'S IF IT HELPS THE COMMITTEE. ON THE RAPID RE HOUSING PROPOSAL FOR YOU SEE IS VERY SIMILAR TO A A LITTLE MUCH LARGER DOLLAR AMOUNT PROPOSAL FOR CSU. WE THOUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF TIME WE COULD CONSOLIDATE OUR COMMENTS ON THE CSU ITEM -- SAW FOCUS MY MY COMMENTS ON THE FIRST TWO ITEMS. WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST PROPOSAL FOR YOU SEE OUR P.. WE THINK THIS RAISES THREE KEY ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATION IS A FAIRLY BROAD ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE FACES EACH YEAR AS IT'S THINKING ABOUT ADDRESSING THE STATE'S. A LONG TERM LIABILITIES. ARE THE CITY CURRENTLY CONTRIBUTES FUNDS INTO THREE PENSION SYSTEMS CALPERS CASTERS AND USE YOUR PC. AND SO THE QUESTION IS. GIVEN THAT ALL THREE OF THESE SYSTEMS HAVE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES WHAT'S HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE FUNDS TO ADDRESS THESE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. WHAT APPROACH WOULD BE TO ADDRESS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND PERSON STIRS FIRST? THE RATIONALE BEHIND APPROACH WHERE THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THAT APPROACH WOULD BE THAT THE STATE ALL UP LARGELY DETERMINES PENSION BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE SYSTEMS. IT ALSO DETERMINES THE FUNDING POLICIES. BY CONTRAST THE REGION'S NOT THE STATE LEGISLATURE DIRECTLY ADOPT PENSION BENEFITS IN THE FUNDING POLICY FOR YOU SEE OUR P.. SO THERE'S A SOMEWHAT LESS CLEAR -- STATES -- RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS ANY UNFUNDED LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM UNDER FUNDING -- THE PENSION SYSTEM IN PREVIOUS YEARS NOT SO THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT BE INTERESTED AND ADDRESSING COST PRESSURES AT THE UNIVERSITY. IF I WERE INTERESTED IN DOING THAT -- IT COULD A BIG COULD APPROPRIATE THE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR YOU SEE OUR P.. THAT SAID OUR SECOND ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATION IS THAT ONE WAY THE LEGISLATURE COULD SORT OF GAUGE HIS QUESTION IS BY HAVING. AN ASSET AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE FISCAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH PAYING DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FASTER. RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T PROVIDED THAT ESTIMATES THE LEGISLATURE'S LACKING A KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION THAT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD REQUEST FROM THE ADMINISTRATION BEFORE MAKING FINAL DECISIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL. THIRD. WE RECOMMEND THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES DECIDE TO ADOPT -- FUND THIS PROPOSAL IT COULD CONSIDER -- SOME SORT OF MATCH BETWEEN THE GENERAL FUND IN UC'S NON STATE FUNDING. FOR SOME CONTEXT OF UC'S ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLAR LIVE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THAT'S ROUTE REPRESENTS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. BOTH WITH ITS CORE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND ITS NON CORE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS ITS MEDICAL CENTERS OF STUDENT HOUSING PROGRAMS. I'M A FIRM IN PROVIDING SOME SORT OF MATCH WOULD ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS PAYING FOR THE PORTION THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND THAT THE NOT SAFE PORTION IS PAYING FOR THE NON STATE FUNCTIONS OF THE OF THE SYRUPY. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS CONCEPT OF OF SHARING BETWEEN CORE NON CORE FUNDING. IS ALREADY PRESENT USE YOUR P. CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY MAKES A CONTRIBUTIONS TO USE YOUR PC. AND MAKES US CONTRIBUTIONS OF A COMBINATION OF CORE FUNDING AND AND NON CORE FUNDING. SO THIS WOULD THIS THIS MATCHING POLICY WOULD EFFECTIVELY RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT WHAT HOW IT'S ALREADY FUNDED. REGARDING THE SECOND PROPOSAL ON OF THE DYSLEXIA CENTER PILOT PROGRAM. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT THE PILOT WOULD BE PART OF A BROADER EFFORT. TO SCALE ACROSS THE STATE NEW WAYS TO TEST AND TO INTERVENE. FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE DYSLEXIA OR OTHER FORMS OF LEARNING DISABILITIES. THE FIRST CONSIDERATION THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE IS HOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD INTERACT WITH THE STATE'S EXISTING SPECIAL EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HELPS US SCHOOLS IDENTIFY IN SUPPORT STUDENTS HAVE LEARNING DISABILITIES. SECOND GIVEN THAT THE OVER ARCHING ARE FULL OF THE PILOT IS TO POTENTIALLY SCALE THIS STATE WHY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO UNDERSTAND. OF THE THE THE PATH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SEES TO GET THERE BEFORE PERFORATING FUNDING. THIRD OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE CENTER HAS RAISED TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY DUE TO COVER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PROGRAMMING THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO UNDERSTAND. WHY THESE FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN WIDE STATE FUNDING IS NEEDED TO CARRY OUT THIS PILOT? AND FINALLY WERE THE LEGISLATURE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING -- THIS PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THAT INCORPORATE -- OF REPORTING LANGUAGE ON HOW THE FUNDS ARE SPENT ON THE OUTCOMES AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEXT STEPS WOULD BE TO SCALE THE STATEWIDE. THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU -- FIRST UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA. I THINK YOU SAVOR CANON UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT WE'RE PLEASED THAT THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZES THE FUNDING NEED FOR YOU SEE OUR P.. AS THE LA -- STATED YOU SEE OUR P. CURRENTLY HAS AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY TEN BILLION DOLLARS WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL PAY THAT -- WE WILL MAKE THAT MONEY UP BY -- TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN UNDER THE CURRENT ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS -- HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YOU SEE DEPOSITED ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TO USE THE R. P. FROM EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS OF WHICH ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION CAME FROM. COR FUNDS -- AND WE ALREADY IN NINETEEN TWENTY AN ADDITION TO OUR EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS WERE PLANNING AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT. FROM STEP BROTHER NEWS INTO YOU SEE OUR PEACE SO WE DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED YET ANOTHER MATCH ON TOP WITH THE GOVERNOR'S -- TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TO USE THE RPG -- THEN REGARDING DE DYSLEXIA CENTER WE BELIEVE THAT THE UC FACULTY CAN CREATE UP AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THAT TEACHERS STATEWIDE COULD USE. TO IDENTIFY STUDENTSWITH DYSLEXIA. IT IS -- TYPE OF LEARNING DISABILITY THAT CAN BE EASILY MISUNDERSTOOD BECAUSE THE STUDENT HAS TROUBLE READING AND SPELLING. AND WITH UC FACULTY USING THEIR RESEARCH AND LEARNING DISABILITIES AND ARE COMBINING TALKED WITH OTHER FIELDS THAT THEY STUDY WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY. CREATE POSITIVE CHANGE FOR THE STATE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. IN REGARDS TO THE FACILITIES NEED STUDY UC'S SUPPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE LANGUAGE AND CHANGING THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR OUR FACILITY STUDY. I HAVE -- CHECKED IN WITH OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY FOLKS AND THE BOND SALES -- WILL NOT BE INTERFERED WITH BY CHANGING THE FUNDING SOURCE OF THIS STUDY. IN TERMS OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR YOU SEE LEGAL SERVICES FOR ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY -- BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN YOU SEE PRESIDENT APOLLO TANO BEGAN FUNDING A LEGAL SERVICES CENTER AT UC DAVIS FROM THE U. C. O. P. FUNDING. AND FROM ITS OPENING IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CENTER SO A THREE HUNDRED AND 40% INCREASING CASES. IT STARTED WITH THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN CASES AND IT HAS GROWN TO OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED ANNUALLY -- IMMIGRATION CASES ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND EXPOSURE WITH STUDENTS TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE TURNING TWENTY ONE CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO LEGALLY STAY IN THE COUNTRY AND NOT BEING ABLE TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY -- WE CURRENTLY HAVE A LAWYER AT EVERY CAMPUS ACCEPTED UC BERKELEY WHICH CONTRACTS OUT CHOOSE THE CONTRACT OUT BUT WE HAVE A UC LAWYER AT EVERY CAMPUS. ASSISTING OUR STUDENTS AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROGRAM AND HOW THE STUDENTS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES UPON GRADUATION AND WE REQUEST THAT YOU APPROVED OF EARNERS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT LEGAL SERVICES -- NOW I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO WILL DISCUSS RAPID RE HOUSING EFFORTS. YEAH. WELL TO MIKE'S [inaudible] OKAY BACK. TURN INTO A DJ BOOTH OKAY HI GOOD MORNING WE PRAYED -- SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT YOU REQUESTED FOR US TO GO INTO THE DATA WAS THE LAST TIME SO. AS PART OF THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO STUDENT WILL BEING YOU SEE HAS PRACTICALLY BEGUN TO EXAMINE THE HOUSING CHALLENGES STUDENT FACE. CURRENT DATE IN THIS AREA ARE LIMITED AT BOTH THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL NEVER THE LESS YOU SEE TOOK A FIRST INTERNAL STEP A PRELIMINARY ASSESSING HOUSING CHALLENGES BY INCLUDING ONE QUESTION OF HOMELESSNESS. IN OUR LARGEST STUDIES THE UC UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE SERVING THE GRADUAL BEING SURVEY -- THE U. CUES IS A CENSUS SURVEY AND AS SUCH EVERY MEMBER OF UC'S UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION IS ASKED TO COMPLETE THE SURVEY THE LARGE SAMPLE SIZE AND GOOD RESPONSE RATE OF 33%. OF YOU KEY SURVEY ALLOWS RESEARCHERS TO PRODUCE MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF FOOD INSECURITY WITHIN THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT POPULATION AS MUCH AS THE HOMELESSNESS. THE GRADUAL BEING SERVICE A LARGE SCALE SAMPER SERVER WITH ROBUST ENOUGH SAMPLE TO CREATE ACCURATE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF HOMELESSNESS AMONGST OUR POPULATIONS. SO THE STUDY IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS -- SHOWCASE AT 5% OF BOTH YOU SEE UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE STUDENT POPULATIONS SAY THAT HAD EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AT SOME POINT DURING THEIR ENROLLMENT WITH VARIOUS DEGREES ACROSS THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES WARRING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HOUSING MARKETS. AND THE DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS AND YOU SEE QUESTION PROVIDED MULTIPLE EXPONENTIAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOR PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY WITH BEYOND JUST HOMELESSNESS SUCH AS COUCH SURFING -- AT A FRIEND'S PLACE OR LIVING ON THE STREETS OR SLEEPING OVERNIGHT AT LIBRARIES WHAT WE LEARNED HERE IS THAT LGBT PLUS STUDENTS TRANSFER STUDENTS LOW INCOME STATUS STUDENTS. AND FORMER FOSS YOUTH EACH HAVE HIGHER RATES AS COMPARED TO THEIR COUNTERPARTS -- AND THE IMPACT ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IS THAT FOR STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR HOUSING IN SECURITY THE CONSISTENTLY OUTPERFORM LOWER THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS WHO ARE HOUSING SECURE AND OUR FOOD ARE AND OR FOOD TO CARE. SOMETHING THAT'S NOTABLE IS THAT STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING BOTH FOOD AND SECURITY IN HOMELESS LANCE IN THEIR FIRST YEAR SECOND YEAR AND THIRTY YEAR ALL ARE BELOW THREE POINT OH GPA. WHICH MAKE SIX SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND ON AND OFF CAMPUS JOBS AND THEN IMPACTS THEIR TRANSITIONS TO GRADUATE SCHOOL AFTER THE FACT. SO WHEN IT COMES TO THIS RAPID RE HOUSING STRATEGY WE'RE VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT THE POINT MILLION DOLLAR OF ONGOING ALLOCATION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISED. FOR RAPID RE HOUSING SERVICES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO UTILIZING OUR CAMPUS BASIC NEEDS COMMITTEES THE SYSTEM MIGHT COMMITTEE AND ARE CALIFORNIA HIGHER ADD BASIC NEEDS ALLIANCE. TO LAUNCH HOUSING NAVIGATION AND RENTAL SUBSIDIES AND INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS OF THE AFOREMENTIONED POPULATION THAT HIGHER RATES OF HOMELESSNESS WILL POWER TIES THOSE POPULATIONS AS WE MOVE EQUITABLY TOLL WORDS. A BETTER HOUSING EXPANDS OR STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS CHALLENGE THE FUNDING ALLOCATION WILL BE DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY AND FORM BY THE CAMPUS HOMELESS RATE IDENTIFIED IN THE STUDY ABOVE -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ALL FOR THOSE MEMBERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT PER CAMPUS -- WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR ON GOING BELIEVING COMMITMENT TO OUR BASIC NEEDS EFFORTS OF ALL THREE OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS. THESE FUNDS FOR CCCC ISSUING YOU SEE WILL ALLOW US TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS IN NEED AND LEARN WITH EACH OTHER HOW TO BETTER SERVE OUR STUDENTS. AND MOVE TOWARDS ERADICATING ECONOMIC FOOD AND HOUSING CHALLENGES THE BETTER THAT WE CARE FOR OUR STUDENTS TODAY THE BETTER THEY WILL CARE FOR OUR STATE TOMORROW AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. GO TO MIKE'S. OKAY NICE JOB THANK YOU. MR O'DONNELL. THANK YOU I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR-WE COVERED ISSUE [inaudible] THREE AND WAS JUST THREE THERE WHAT WE DO. FORTY WE COVER FOR THEIR AS WELL. NOT YET NO OKAY. I WAS LISTENING MOSTLY. THANK YOU NO I JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- WITH REGARD TO THE THE THE USE RETIREMENT PLAN WHO'S THAT GOVERNED BY WE HAVE KßT WE HAVE STIRS WE A PERSON I KNOW THE GOVERNING STRUCTURE THERE. WHO GOVERNS THE UC RETIREMENT SYSTEM THAT WILL BE THE UC REGENTS UC REGENTS? ARE THEY TODAY WHEN WE DID THE THE PEPPER CHANGES TO THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM MAYBE SIX YEARS AGO OR SO TODAY IT UP THE SAME CHANGES TO THE TO THE UC SYSTEM. YES WE DID UP A DOCTOR PEPPER CHANGES NOW THERE ARE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE GRANDFATHERED INTO THE OLD SYSTEM. BEGAN IN -- TWENTY THIRTEEN THE PEPPER CHANGES WERE ADOPTED FOR TO USE YOU HAVE NOW OFFERED TO FIND IN AND AND I FOUND IT. A DEFINED AN UNDEFINED PLAN CORRECT YOU CAN CHOOSE AS YOU. THAT'S CORRECT SO WE IDENTIFY A WE OFFER TO TRADITIONAL PLAN AND THEN WE OFFER WHAT'S CALLED A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN WHICH IS MORE OF A FOR A ONE CASE STYLE PLAN SO IS THAT ALL EXASPERATING. THE PENSION PROBLEM. WE DON'T THINK SO WE ACTUALLY THINK THE FOUR ONE CAPE STYLE PLAN IS CREATING SAVINGS WITHIN YOU SEE OUR P. WE DO TAKE -- 6% OF EVERY EMPLOYEE'S SALARY -- OR SORRY AND EQUIVALENT OF 6% OF EVERY EMPLOYEE'S SALARY AND DEPOSITED INTO THIRD TRADITIONAL PLAN WHETHER OR NOT THAT EMPLOYEE CHOOSES TRADITIONAL OR THE FOUR OH ONE K. STYLE PLAN. THAT IS USED TO PAY DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF THE TRADITIONAL PLAN -- WHAT MAKES THE FOUR ONE CASE STYLE PLAN OTHER DEFINED CONTRIBUTION ATTRACTIVE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES? IS WE FIND THAT THE YOUNGER WORKFORCE MOVES -- IN AND OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM QUITE RAPIDLY THEY COME FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND THEN I UNDERSTAND THAT I JUST IN THE THE THINKING THERE. AGAIN I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT I JUST WANTED MY QUESTION WAS REALLY POURED INTO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S EXASPERATING. THE ANY LIABILITY -- IMPACTING ANY LIABILITY AND YOU RESPONDED SO THANK YOU AND THEN IT SAYS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR YOU WANT TO SHIP FIVE BILLION DOLLARS APPEARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS TO CONDUCT A FACILITY NEEDS STUDY. THAT'S CORRECT WE WERE GOING TO USE FIVE MILLION OF OUR A. B. NINETY FOUR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS. FOR THE FACILITY STUDY THAT'S BOND DEBT AND DELAY -- HAD RECOMMENDED WE INSTEAD USE ONE TIME MONEY SO WE'RE SAYING YES WE CAN DO THAT. SO WHY IN THE WORLD WILL COST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A FACILITY NEEDS STUDY -- SUCCESS I AM I GONNA BE US THAT IS JUST CRAZY HOW MANY CAMPUSES. TEN CAMPUSES HOW MANY MODERN LOT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE WHEN I WAS TEN CAMPUS SEVEN CAMPUSES SO IT'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO DO A FACILITIES ASSESSMENT STUDY FOR EACH CAMPUS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I THINK THAT'S CRAZY. I I JUST THERE IT'S BEEN CANNOT CONVINCE ME THAT IT'S FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WERE THE WORK TO SAY WELL WE NEED THIS MUCH SPACE WE WE HAVE TO HAVE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS WHO HAVE A LOT OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE. AND THE COST AND I DON'T. I DON'T BUY IT I JUST YOU KNOW YOUR COST PER QUARE FOOT IN YOUR BILL IS ALONE A PRETTY OUT OF THE NORM AND MAYBE THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY BUT I I JUST DO NOT BY THAT -- BUT LET'S MOVE ON THERE'S FOR HIM IS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS CORRECT IS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO INCREASE -- INCREASE TO THE UC LEGAL IMMIGRATION SERVICES PROGRAM IT'S NOT FOR HER MILLION ISN'T NO NO IT'S NOT FOR MY NUMBERS WRONG FOUR HUNDRED IT'S LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE FIRST YEAR. ONE THOUSAND YES AND OKAY INCREASING DOES A LOT DIFFERENT. OKAY MY NUMBER WAS INCORRECT THANK YOU -- GREAT -- AND AND I KNOW THAT --UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN. WE ALLOCATED ONE TIME FUNDS THE UC I THINK IT WAS. SEVENTY MILLION THAT WAS USED FOR ENROLLMENT SO YOU THEN NOW HAVE A WHOLE CORRECT BECAUSE THAT WAS FUNDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS. THAT'S CORRECT WE OWE LESS GOING FOR A REFUND YOU ON A ONE TIME BASIS OR WE WE WE ARE BY SOMETHING ON A PERMANENT BASIS YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS WHOLE. THAT'S CORRECT SIR WE ARE REQUESTING -- THAT THE PRIOR YEAR ONE TIME FUNDS BE MADE PERMANENT AND THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISED HAS NOT DONE THAT YET SO IN THE NUMBER FOR THE ONGOING IS. OF WE'VE WE WOULD LIKE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING BUT THE ONE TIME MONEY IS. NINETY FIVE RIGHT OKAY SAID DON'T SPEAK TO THE ONE TIME RIGHT NOW YEAH SO I I THINK IT'S IT'S INCOME ON THIS BODY MISTER CHAIR TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THAT MONEY ON GOING -- SPECIALLY THAT THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION. IN A BILL THAT IN ON ON GOING BASIS AS WE CONSIDER WHAT WE FORWARD OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WITHOUT A TURN ABOUT YOU YEAH THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL GOOD QUESTIONS ON A FOLLOW UP ON THOSE IN IN A BIT -- FIRST THOUGH MISTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- MS SO. THE PART IN IT. YES. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PROVIDING THIS. TELEPHONE BOOK OF THE INFORMATION ON TO SUPPORT THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA -- BUDGET REQUEST AND I YOU KNOW. I I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET A OF A MORE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE DECLINING STATE -- SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND I I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I THAT I HAD THIS INFORMATION -- CORRECT -- HI I SHOULD HAVE ASKED. YOU. TO BUT I BRING YOUR COPY BUT PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE SOUTH THE TOP YOUR HEAD -- FIRST OF ALL -- IN THIS REPORT THERE'S A SECTION THAT TALKS ABOUT HISTORICAL CHANGES TO STATE FUNDS SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT TALKS ABOUT HOW -- IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE THE STATE DEDICATED FOUR POINT ONE OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND TO THE UNIVERSITY TODAY FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS JUST TWO POINT FIVE IN THE STATE BUDGET THAT. IS AT THE SOUND ACCURATE YES OKAY. AND THEN -- IN THAT SAME SECTION IT TALKS ABOUT -- IT OUT USE EITHER I KNOW THAT THERE IS -- AN EMPHASIS ON THE CORE FUNDS -- FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AS DISTINGUISHED FROM SOME OF THE OTHER MAJOR SOURCE OF REVENUES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM LIKE THE MEDICAL CENTERS. BUT THE CORE FUNDS IS IS KIND OF LIKE YOUR GENERAL FUND THAT THAT PROVIDES THE PRIMARILY THAT THE SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR THE OPERATIONS FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. THAT'S CORRECT AND THE REASON WE FOCUS ON THE CORE FUNDS AS WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TRANSFER FUNDING BETWEEN THOSE VARIOUS POTS THEIR LEGALLY RESTRICTED SO THE CORE FUNDS PAY FOR THE INSTRUCTORS THE FACULTY. ALL THE STUFF ON THE CAMPUSES. OKAY SO -- IN THIS -- SECTION TALKING ABOUT. THE HISTORIC DECLINE IN STATE OF SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. THERE IS A SECTION THAT TALKS ABOUT STATE SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S BASE BUDGET. DECLINED BY 56%. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE IS THAT. I'M SON RIGHT A MINIMUM READING FOR A FROM THE REPORTS I ASSUME THAT THAT'S CORRECT YES THAT WOULD BE CORRECT OKAY AND IT SAYS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE STATE FUNDING FOR YOU TO UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. CONTRIBUTED ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PER STUDENT OR ABOUT 72% OF THE TOTAL COST -- WHEREAS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE STATE'S SHARE DECLINE -- TOTAL COSTS YES THAT'S CORRECT THERE'S BEEN A RAPID DECLINE IN THE STATE FUNDING COMPONENT FOR YOU OKAY FOR STUDENTS. SO SO IN OTHER WORDS -- YOU KNOW. WHEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE -- THE HISTORY AT LEAST SINCE. TWO THOUSAND IT SEEMS LIKE. WE HAVE HAD DRAMATIC DECLINES AND THE STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- ESPECIALLY DURING THE THE TWO RECESSION SINCE. TWO THOUSAND AND WE NEVER. RECOVERED -- THE LOSSES FROM THOSE TWO RECESSIONS IS IS THAT A FAIR DESCRIPTION OF THAT'S CORRECT SIR AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO UNIVERSITY MADE UP. FOR THAT REVENUE WEST BY ADMITTING OFF MORE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DISCUSS NEXT OKAY SO -- YEAH. EXACTLY SO SO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FELT LIKE IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR THE THE DRAMATIC DECLINE IN STATE. A SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA GOING TO HEAD TO MAKE IT UP WITH THE WITH THE REVENUES FROM THE NON RESIDENT TUITION. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND AND THAT HAS LED TO RESULTS LIKE. 25% OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION ADD TO OUR MOST -- POPULAR -- CAMPUSES -- BERKELY UCLA AND UC SAN DIEGO ONE OUT OF FOUR OF THE UNDERGRADS LOTS GOING. TO NON CALIFORNIA KIDS. THAT'S CORRECT THOSE CAMPUSES ARE ABOUT 2423% OKAY SO YOUR POSITION IS IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S POSITION IS THAT. AS THAT -- THE THE FACT THAT ARE. YOU KNOW ONE OUT OF EVERY FOR UNDERGRAD SLOTS FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA GOING TO NON CALIFORNIA KIDS IS. A REFLECTION OF OR OR OR IN IN IN YOUR OPINION A INEVITABLE -- WAVE IT WAS A IT WAS A RESPONSE TO THE DRAMATIC DECLINE IN STATE FUNDING FOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS A RESPONSE AND DURING THAT TIME WE HAD A LOT OF NEW COST PRESSURES WE JUST DISCUSSED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RETIREMENT PROGRAM -- TO UNIVERSITY HAD HAD NO CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THE RETIREMENT PROGRAM BETWEEN THE LATE EIGHTIES AND TWENTY TEN AND THEN IN TWENTY TEN WHEN -- THE GREAT RECESSION HAVE COST A COLLAPSE IN THE VALUE OF THE PLAN WE HAD TO START UP -- CONTRIBUTIONS AGAINST THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE UNIVERSITY ARE NOW AT 14% OF EVERY EMPLOYEE'S SALARY. SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURE FOR THE UNIVERSITY IN ADDITION -- TO ALL THE OTHER COST PRESSURES ANOTHER FACTOR THAT OCCURRED IS BECAUSE THE STATE HAS HAD NO GEO BONDS FOR THE UNIVERSITY SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SIX YOU GAVE US THE AUTHORITY TO FIND -- BOND FINANCING OUT OF OUR OWN BUDGET AND WE STARTED DOING THAT IN ORDER TO RESPOND. TO CREATING MORE SPACE HOWEVER -- THAT BOND DEBT IS NOW CREATING A PRESSURE ON THE UNIVERSITY'S OPERATING BUDGET ON THE COR FRONT SIDE AS WELL -- AND BECAUSE OF THESE COST PRESSURES AND INFLATION. THE THOUGH THE STATE HAS RESTORED OUR FUNDING FROM BILL ONE BILLION DOLLAR CUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TWENTY TEN WHEN THAT OCCURRED. BECAUSE OF THESE ADDITIONAL PRESSURES AND INFLATION AND HAVING TO PAY OUR FACULTY MORE -- WE HAVE FEWER DOLLARS AVAILABLE PER STUDENT AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT. BUT A I I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP OUR FOCUS I MEAN I I I APPRECIATE BASICALLY COST PRESSURES -- HAVE GONE UP AS A AS IT'S GONNA FOR ALL OF OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS BUT I IN IN TERMS OF THE THE HIGH LEVEL BIG PICTURE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THEY GOING FROM THE FROM THE THE THE STATE LEGISLATURES. US SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FROM ABOUT 70% 72% TO ABOUT 37% I MEAN THAT KIND OF CAPTURES THE THE ESSENCE OF OF THE DRAMATIC DECLINE RANK. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY -- DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGREE WITH -- THOSE NUMBERS. MISTER TUCCI OUT AND LOOKING AT THE TRANS IN STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORTED THE UC FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TO THE CURRENT YEAR -- YOU KNOW YOU DO WE DO HAVE. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PER STUDENT SUPPORT BUT I THINK IT'S NOT CAPTURE HERE'S THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY SINCE THAT TIME PERIOD. BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO INCREASE NONRESIDENT ROLE MEANT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. BASED TUITION DURING THIS TIME SO NOT ONLY ARE THEY TAKING AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM SUSAN FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FROM OUT OF STATE AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THEY'RE ALSO LEVERAGING ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND THROUGH CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND THE LAST I CHECKED I THINK THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA WITH A SIZEABLE CHUNK OF MONEY AS WELL. SO WHILE THOSE PARTICULAR GRAPHS AND FIGURES TELL ONE STORY I THINK THERE'S A BROADER LOOK AT HOW THE FUNDING SOURCES OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S CHANGE OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. OKAY SO THE A FAIR ENOUGH SO -- FOR THE CAL GRANT -- STATE. FUNDING AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP -- WHAT DO YOU DO YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH IS GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- WELL A THROUGH. THE STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR FINANCIAL AID I EXITED THE EXACT FIGURE I DON'T HAVE -- THE S. WHEN I COULD GIVE YOU BASED ON NUMBERS I'VE SEEN PREVIOUSLY. THAT'S HONOR MILLION. I'M SURE A LOT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION OKAY SEVEN PLUS THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WHICH IS MAYBE CLOSE TO A HUNDRED MILLION YEAH LET ME. GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I WOULD SAY THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS IS IS WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LAST COUPLE YEARS. SO YOU SO GET GIVEN THAT -- THE THE THE THE STATE TO IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE CREDITED -- I MEAN THAT THAT THAT IS A SUPPORT -- FOR A YOU SEE -- STUDENTS -- IN IN TERMS OF THIS -- THIS THE PICTURE THAT THE THE STATE FUNDING AT LEAST SAID AS THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA PRESENTS AT THE STATE FUNDING FOR THE UC -- DROPPED FROM 72% 237%. IF IF YOU WERE TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT -- THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID CONTRIBUTION -- HOW WOULD YOU ADJUST TO THAT THAT DECLINE IN STATE FUNDING? WELL I'M NOT SURE I HAVE THAT ANNOUNCES PREPARED BUT THE STATE BUDGET IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS IS IN THE STATE ECONOMY IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN. TWO THOUSAND AND OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS FAN A STRUGGLE BUDGETARY LEE PARTICULARLY IN THE INTO THE PAST RECESSIONS. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR COMMITMENTS BOTH NOW IN THE FUTURE. AND STRUCTURALLY TRYING TO RETURN. TO AREAS OF OF FUNDING WHERE WE HAD A MUCH STRONGER. REVENUE BASE -- WOULD BE TRUE DIFFICULT TO O CURRENTLY. IS IN A FACT THAT. FOR THE LAST. EIGHT YEARS WE'VE HAD. DISTRAUGHT BAKED CONSISTENT ECONOMIC GROWTH RECOVERY WITH POSITIVE BUT BUDGETS IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. THAT IS TRUE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S IS HAS RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT REINVESTMENT INCLUDING THIS YEAR WHICH IT'S RECEIVED. LIKELY THE LARGEST INFUSION OF ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT SINCE. TWO THOUSAND I GUESS I'M I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW I I'M I'M HEARING. YOU KNOW NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS THIS NATIONAL TREND IN DECLINING STATE FUNDING FOR FOR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION -- AND AM SEEING THESE THESE NUMBERS BEING PRESENTED BY THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE A PLAN AS TO HOW -- TO YOU KNOW GET US BACK AT LEAST TO TO WORRY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE OR WE'RE CERTAINLY OPENING UP A LONG TERM CONVERSATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO FOCUS ON LONG TERM FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THEUNIVERSITY. ACCESS FOR STUDENTS SAND -- FISCAL CERTAINTY FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. OKAY BUT IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL -- INSTITUTION THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA I MEAN YOU KNOW I I CONSIDER THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE. YOU KNOW -- AMONG THE THE BEST THINGS THAT WE HAVE GOING FOR US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M ALWAYS BRAGGING ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW NOT ONLY UC'S BUT THE CSU SECOND COLLEGES THAT WE HAVE THE BEST PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY -- AND AND AND YET I MEAN I'M HEARING. YOU KNOW. A ONE THAT IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS TO GET INTO OUR SCHOOLS AND INTO. THAT WE MAY BE AT RISK OF OF OF YOU KNOW -- DAMAGING THE THE THE THE THE REPUTATION AND AND AND THE THE QUALITY THE FUNDAMENTAL QUALITY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM I I WOULD JUST ASK ME -- MISTER CHAIR THAT THAT WE THEY SAID THAT WE KEEP -- THIS BIG PICTURE IN MIND THAT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] YOU KNOW. DYSLEXIA EARLY INTERVENTION PILOT PROGRAMS AND RAPID RE HOUSING AND YOU SEE LEGAL IMMIGRATION SERVICES. WITH THAT WE KEEP THE BIG PICTURE MIND ABOUT HOW THIS IS PART OF WE WE HAVE WE HAVE WE'RE FAR FROM -- RESTORING -- THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THEY THAT THEY HAD. TO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE -- NOT YET RESTORED. TO A FROM THE LAST TWO RECESSIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER. MARTUCCI. I THINK THAT YOU. A RAISED THAT A FEW ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ALWAYS KEEP. KEEP OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE ABOUT. AND THAT'S JUST THE OVERALL. HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AND IT IS SOMEWHAT. FRANKLY HONEST WITH THE U. DEPRESSING THAT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS SEVEN YEARS AND FIVE FIVE SEVEN CAM FUNNY -- TRACK RECORD FOR YOU IT TEARS UP A YOU'VE BEEN HERE -- IN THE ERA WHEN WE'VE INVESTED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS MORE. FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT NEARLY ENOUGH AND I THINK ONE OF THE REALITY CHECKS IS THAT WE DO MOST LIKELY HAVE A DOWNTURN COMING. AND AND EVEN DURING THESE GOOD TIMES WE HAVEN'T KEPT UP THE THIS YEAR THERE'S NOT. MONEY AND THE BUDGET TO ENROLL ONE NEW CALIFORNIA STUDENT I KNOW THIS MONEY TO FOR PRIOR YEARS COMMITMENTS BUT THAT'S WHAT WE GET IN OUR COMMUNITIES ALL THE TIME WE TALK ABOUT THE NEXT ITEM THAT. PEOPLE COME OUT SAY MY KID MY NEIGHBOR MY NEPHEW SOMEBODY WE NOW AS A FOUR POINT THREE GPA PLAYED UCLA YOU SEE IRVINE UC BERKELEY AND THEY CAN'T GET IN THEY HAVE TO GO OUT OF STATE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS CALIFORNIA KIDS? AND WE DON'T HAVE A REALLY GOOD ANSWER FOR THEM. AND SO THESE THE WHOLE NOTION ABOUT THESE COST DRIVERS WHICH GOVERNOR BROWN TALKED ABOUT FOR YEARS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO GO BACK TO BECAUSE THIS CURRENT MODEL IS NOT SUSTAINABLE IT'S A HOUSE OF CARDS. I CAN 1100% THAT WERE NOT. STEPPING UP WHEN IT COMES TO TO FUNDING HIGHER ED LIKE WE USED TO AS FAR AS THE PERCENT OF OF THE BUDGET -- YOU CAN'T JUST GO BACK IN TIME ALL WE CAN DO IS GO FORWARD. AND AND WITH THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE DO PUT OTHERS AS YOU SAID -- JACK I'M SORRY LAST IMMIGRANTS FORGETS WALLED SWELLED YES -- WE DO HAVE TO CHECKS THAT WE GIVE THE UC ESSENTIALLY WE GIVE THE GENERAL FUND JACK AND THEN. THE CHECK ITS WAY TAXPAYER MONEY -- FROM THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS YOU KNOW THREE QUARTERS OF BILLION DOLLARS SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN IT DOLLARS IT TAKES A NOR THAT. BUT EVEN THOSE THE COMBINED I WOULD I WOULD -- PROBABLY SEE PLATE YOU SAID MR MURATSUCHI THAT THE PERCENTAGE THEY WERE PUTTING INTO OVERALL HIRED FUNDING THROUGH UC'S PROBABLY AS A PERCENTAGE OF OF OF THE BUDGET -- NOT WHERE WE WERE NOT WHERE WE WE'RE WHERE WE SHOULD BE -- BUT WE HAVE A REALITY -- LIMITED -- FOUGHT FUNDS HERE FOR US ALL THIS PROPOSALS RIGHT HERE THERE -- IT'S ONE TIME IN THE MAY REVISE. SO WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THIS THIS NOTION OF THAT THE COST DRIVERS BECAUSE THE YEAR AFTER YEAR PROPOSAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY I'M NOT DIMINISHING IT BUT WHEN YOU WANT THREE AND% COVERS THE BASICS YEAR. YOUR COST FOR FACULTY IN YOUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND YOU AND JUST THE THE COR STUFF AND DOESN'T EVEN GET TO THE ISSUES THAT. ARE CONSTITUENTS TALK TO US ABOUT -- AND YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T ADD UP AND IT'S INTO A SHOULD BE A STARK WARNING THAT AGAIN WHO HAD FIVE YEARS IN A ROW. OF A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND AS YOU SAID. THIS YEAR THE LARGEST INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND. IN THE LAST -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND YOU SENT. YEAH YEP ROUGHLY ALMOST TWENTY YEARS. SO -- WE NEED. TO HAVE THAT AS A REALITY CHECK AS WELL -- I DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE THE ENROLLMENT. SO THAT THE UNIT AT THE UNIVERSITIES -- COMMITMENT IS THE THE THE MONEY YOU GOT LAST YEAR ONE TIME USE THAT TO BRING IT IN AT TO FOCUS ON A IN A NEW INCOMING CLASS OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND THAT GOING TO CONTINUE -- WITH OR WITHOUT THAT THE NEW -- ONGOING CAME IN THE BUDGET SO YOU'RE SAYING. THAT'S CORRECT -- IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE'LL LET IN OVER -- TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADS WE RECEIVED ONE TIME. A FUNDING FOR THEM AND THOSE KIDS WILL STILL BE HERE IN FALL TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE'VE HIRED -- LECTURES T. A.'S WE'VE HIRED SOME PERMANENT FACULTY TO TEACH THE CLASSES AND WE'RE HOPING TO GET THOSE FUNDS ON GOING. SO REALLY YOU GOT MONEY TO FUND THEM FOR TWO YEARS RIGHT BECAUSE IF IF IF IF IT'S IT'S ABOUT FIFTY MILLION. ISN'T IT FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS -- UNTIL WE RECEIVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THEM. TWENTY FIVE MILLION [inaudible] OKAY. SO SERE YOU RECEIVED A HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME IF THEY ARE GRADUATE FOR YEARS. YOU SPEND THAT OVER FOUR YEARS AS AN THAT ADD UP TO COULD KICK CARRYING THAT COURT. I KNOW THE THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR TO TUITION BUYOUT HAS ALSO. OPENED SPENT ON CAMPUS COSTS IT THERE TO USE THE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS WELL. WE WE USE IT -- FOR YEAH INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES ON THE CAMPUSES STUDENTS SERVICES CAPITAL OUTLAY YES. OKAY AND AS YOU KNOW WE WE DO HAVE ANOTHER IDEA THE WILL GONNA BRING BACK NEXT WEEK. FOR FOR FUTURE ENROLLMENT GROWTH I'M NOT SURE WE SETTLED IT AS FAR AS LAST YEAR'S COMMITMENT IN THE DECISION THAT THE THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE WHICH WE SUPPORT AND SHE SAID PASSED THE CAMPUSES TO STEP IT UP IN A ROLE -- MORE STUDENTS AND SO THAT WAS THAT WAS THE RIGHT CALL THAT WAS IT'S A DECISION THAT YOU ALL MADE WITH THAT. ONE TIME -- THE MONEY AND I KNOW YOU'RE MAKING YOUR CASE TO HE TO THE GOVERNOR UNSUCCESSFULLY BUT YOU'RE CONTINUE TO DO SO -- YES. AND AND THEN -- LASTLY AS FAR AS THE DID THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES. GO -- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO GET A GOOD UNDERSTANDING ON IT BUT I WILL SAY THAT IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN. WE HEAR THESE CAMPUSES COME IN AND TALK ABOUT THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND I AGREE WITH THE MALL AND SEEN THE THE ISSUES AND SEISMIC ISSUES CERTAINLY AT THAT UC BERKELEY AND HERE DAVIS AN AGING CAMPUS AND SANTA BARBARA WOULD HAVE USE THAT. WE ALWAYS GET APPLES AND ORANGES AS FAR AS THE INFORMATION WHO IS THE WHO HAS THE MOST AND SEISMIC IS THE MOST AND DEFERRED HOW MUCH WE NEED HERE HOW MUCH NEED THERE AND SO -- AND EVERY YOU KNOW WE ASK ABOUT THIS WEEK CAN I GET A PHONE BOOK AB SPREAD SHEETS OF THE PROJECTS WHICH IS. INTERESTING I'M AT SHIRT HELPFUL FOR US INTO FIGURING OUT THE MAGNITUDE AND TO PRIORITIZE. TO PRIORITIZE THIS ISSUE -- AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GET A HOLD OF THIS AND HAVE COME UP WITH A PLAN I THINK WE'RE VERY. AGGRESSIVE OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ARE YOU SEE HOSPITALS BUT SHE WAS SEISMIC. WE KNOW THAT HEY IF YOU DON'T HAVE THESE -- IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY BY THIS YEAR YOU CAN'T OPERATE IN THE STAKES ARE SUPER HIGH OF COURSE FOR OUR HOSPITALS AROUND CALIFORNIA -- YOU KNOW WITH A SERVE DON'T HAVE THE SAME URGENCY FOR OUR UNIVERSITY -- SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT THAT A TRAGEDY TO HAPPEN TO TO MAKE US WAKE UP TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SO. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT -- THAT -- WE WE ARE INTERESTED IN -- I KNOW WE HAVE SOME. KIND OF A MATCHING ISSUE COMING UP ON ENROLLMENT SO WON'T DIG INTO THE WEEDS TOO MUCH SO WAIT FOR THAT. BUT WITH THAT -- AND GO BACK TO MISTER MARTZ SEARCHING THANK YOU I WANTED -- TO AS MISS VIRGIN AND WHEN OTHER -- ITEM. THE I I I I KNOW YOUR YOUR REQUEST WAS -- TO TO KEEP THE COMMITMENT THAT WE HAD MADE. IN THE LAST BUDGET YEAR -- TO TO COMMIT ONGOING FUNDS THAT GUY GOVERNOR BROWN -- AND MADE ONE TIME FUNDS THAT AT THAT'S THE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO ADVISE REQUEST OKAY AND AND COULD YOU WERE. A EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN LIKE. WHY THE GOVERNOR IS -- ALSO DOES NOT ADDRESS THE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ON GOING GENERAL FUND. I REQUEST. I'M NOT CERTAIN WHY THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T INCLUDE THOSE FUNDS IN HIS YOU SEE AND SEVENTY MILLION OF THAT WAS FOR A TUITION BY OUT. OF WHICH HAS BEEN PARTLY USED TO FUND OF PERMANENT FACULTY AT SEVERAL CAMPUSES -- AND WE WE VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THE UNIVERSITIES NEED WILL BE RECOGNIZED THE GOVERNOR AND HIS BUDGET. OF FUNDED MANY OF OUR MANDATORY COST INCREASES IN LABOR AND HEALTH COSTS SO IT APPEARS THAT HE PUT HIS EMPHASIS IN THAT AREA HOWEVER [inaudible] OF THE FUNDING THAT THE GOVERNOR PROVIDED TO US IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BOTH PAY FOR OUR NEW MANDATORY COSTS. ARE DEBT SERVICE CAPITAL OUTLAY DOT SERVICE INCREASES AND TO FUND THE FACULTY TO HAVE BEEN HIRED WITH THE NINETY FIVE MILLION SO. IF WE DON'T GET THE NINETY FIVE MILLION WILL ACTUALLY BE IN A POSITION TO HAVE TO DO CUTS ON OUR CAMPUSES DESPITE THIS HISTORICAL INCREASE THAT WE RECEIVED. SERVICE OF THESE ARE THERE ARE NEW ON GOING COSTS THAT -- THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIANS TAKEN ON WHERE THERE IS NO. LINE ITEM IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THOSE ONGOING COSTS IS THAT. THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED US WITH THE FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE LABOR CONTRACT INCREASES AND THE UC OUR P. AND THE HEALTH. INCREASES BUT WE DID NOT GET THE FIFTEEN MILLION FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY BOND DEBT SERVICE INCREASE. AND WE DIDN'T GET THE OF FUNDING FOR THE WE DIDN'T GET THE NINETY FIVE MILLION FROM THE CURRENT YEAR ON GOING WHICH WE WERE HOPING. TO RECEIVE BECAUSE IT'S PAYING FOR PERMANENT INSTRUCTORS AND STUDENTS WHO ARE HERE SO. WE'RE WE'RE USING IT FOR ACADEMIC QUALITY TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE CLASSES AVAILABLE SO THEY CAN GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER. DIZZY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF RESPONSE YES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MAY REVISIONS INFORMED BY -- THE FIRST ADDRESSING THE MOST PRESSING NEED TO THE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS AGAIN WHY. ARE PROPOSAL -- COVERS THEIR MASTER LABOR COSTS -- HEALTH COSTS AND OTHER FACTORS THE SECOND IS THAT THE HUNDRED FIVE MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU SEE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS IDENTIFIED AS BEING A SOURCE OF ONE TIME FUNDS. THE THIRD IS THAT YOU SEE HAS A MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS BY WHICH IT CAN IT CAN ADDRESS IT'S CASA MAKE PRICE YOU SHIFT ITS PRIORITIES INCLUDING NON RESIDENT TUITION IDENTIFIED SAVINGS IN ITS PROCUREMENT. AND OTHER SOURCES THAT IS -- THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AND AND THAT TELEPHONE BOOK SO THOSE THREE FACETS ADDRESSING THE MOST NECESSARY COSTS --CONTINUING THAT THE EXPECTATION THAT THOSE FUNDS WERE PROVIDED ONE TIME AND A LINE YOU SEE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT A PRIVATE WHEN IT NEEDS TO PRIORITIZE. BASED ON ITS MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS IS ALL OF THE THIS IS SERVICE SEVERAL PIECES THAT INFORMED. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PACKAGE. BUT AGAIN WE'RE RELYING ON AS YOU INDICATED IN PART. ONE OF THE MEASURE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING -- FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WOULD BE. TO CONTINUE RELY ON THE NON RESIDENT TUITION REVENUES ONE REVENUE SOURCE OF THE IDENTIFIED IN THE CLASS OF PLAN FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS WAS AN INCREASE IN NON RESIDENT AND ROMAN. I EXCUSE ME WE ARE RESIDENT TUITION. AND THOSE FUNDS -- I BELIEVE THE REGION'S WILL BE VOTING ON THIS WEEK. IN TERMS OF INCREASING THE TO IT THE NON RESIDENT TUITION THAT'S RIGHT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH. ALL I WILL ASK QUESTIONS OF THAT THE SECOND TWO BUT I DID JUST WANT TO CLARIFY -- WE WE JUST GOT A NOTE FROM THE LA YOU KNOW THAT. THE AMOUNT FOR CAL GRANT AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP FROM THE GENERAL FUND THREE CITY COMMISSION BACK TO YOU SEE IS ONE POINT ONE BILLION. SO IT'S SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION SO GRANTED I'M NOT SAYING THAT GIVES US A PASS BUT I'M SAYING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO A TALLY IN EVERY TIME YOU SEE COMES UP HERE AND SAYS -- IT BASICALLY THAT THAT'S HALF TRUTH AND SO I THINK WE NEED. TO TO FOCUS ON THE TOTAL PICTURE OF OF THE STATE MONEY. GOING TO HELP OURGREAT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THANK YOU MISTER CARR EVAN OFF A BUDGET FOR A COUPLE YEARS THAT'S THANK YOU -- BUT THAT. WINDOW -- HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND HAVE A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON YOU SEE ENROLLMENT AND SPECIFICALLY THE NON RESIDENT ISSUE. WITH THE NON RESIDENT IN ROMAN REPORT WHICH WAS SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE -- A FEW -- WEEKS AGO -- WHICH WAS PREDICATED ON LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACTION ASKING THE SEATED TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT COULD BE DONE. TO TO GO BACK IN AND LOWER THE AMOUNT OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AND CONVERSELY ENROLL MORE. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID ALCOCER. AND THE ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR BUDGET ANALYSIS AND PLANNING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE REPORT SUBMITTED BY THE UNIVERSITY IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST. IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT IF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. DESCRIBES THE IMPACT OF REDUCING THE ENROLLMENT OF NON RESIDENT FRESHMEN STUDENTS TO NO MORE THAN 10%. OF THE FRESHMAN CLASS AT EVERY UC CAMPUS BY THE TWENTY TWENTY NINE THIRTY ACADEMIC YEAR. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A HAND UP TODAY THAT'LL BE REFERENCING -- ON SLIDE TO MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL FOCUS ON THE ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF REDUCING NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT. I DO NOT MEAN TO DISCOUNT THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS OF LEARNING AND LIVING ALONGSIDE STUDENTS FROM OTHER STATES COUNTRIES AND CULTURES. BUT THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL SEEM MOST RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEES DISCUSSIONS TODAY. AND REALLY ARE THE FOCUS OF THE REPORT. WE LOOK AT FOR AREAS A FINANCIAL IMPACT. FIRST THE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT HIGHER LEVELS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ENROLLMENT. TO FILL THE SEATS THAT WOULD BECOME VACANT. AS NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT DECLINES. WE ASSUME THAT'S KEY TO THIS PROPOSED POLICY THAT THE GOAL IS NOT TO REDUCE NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT FOR ITS OWN SAKE. BUT TO DO SO IN ORDER TO ENROLL EVEN MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS. SECOND WE ESTIMATE THE REVENUE FROM NON RESIDENT TUITION THAT WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED UNDER THE SCENARIO. AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THAT I JUST MENTIONED. WE ALSO EXPECT INCREASED DEMAND FOR FINANCIAL AID FROM UC'S ON INSTITUTIONAL IN PROGRAM. SINCE NON RESIDENTS WERE INELIGIBLE FOR YOU SEE GRANTS WOULD BE REPLACED BY NEW CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WHO LIKE OUR CURRENT STUDENTS OFTEN RELY ON YOU SEE GRANTS TO FINANCE THEIR EDUCATION? FINALLY IN ROLLING MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED WOULD ALSO INCREASE AWARDS FROM THE STATE'S CAL GRANT PROGRAM. I DISPLAY THREE SHOWS THE COMBINED MAGNITUDE OF THE FISCAL IMPACT OF REDUCING NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT. IN EACH OF THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IN THE FIRST YEAR AS YOU CAN SEE THE COMBINED IMPACT WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL. ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. BUT WOULD QUICKLY GROW AND WOULD ADD ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW FUNDING NEEDS BY THE YEAR -- TWENTY NINE TWENTY TWENTY NINE THIRTY THE CUMULATIVE COST OF THE TEN YEAR PERIOD WOULD EXCEED FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. I WANT TO NOTE THAT THESE FIGURES ARE IN ADDITION TO THE STATE FUNDING NEEDED FOR CATS Và HORNET RESIDENT ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THAT WE ARE ALREADY ASSUMING EVEN WITHOUT THIS POLICY CHANGE. IN NINETEEN TWENTY AS YOU KNOW WE ARE REQUESTING TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A TREATABLE TO CALIFORNIA ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF TWENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES NEXT YEAR THAT'S BUILT INTO A NINETEEN TWENTY PLAN. I'D LIKE TO NOW DESCRIBE SOME OF THE PROJECTIONS FOR ENROLLMENT FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FUTURE YEARS THAT UNDERLIE THESE ESTIMATES. TURNING TO SLIDE. FOR A TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES THAT YOU SEE HERE -- WE COMPARED ESTIMATED IN ROMANS AGAINST A BASE CASE ENROLLMENTS AREA. THAT WE THINK REPRESENTS A REASONABLE LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH TO EXPECT OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IT IS BY NECESSITY AN ESTIMATE SINCE CAMPUS DO NOT HAVE FULLY DEVELOPED TENURE ENROLLMENT PLANS. SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE ASSUMED AN ANNUAL INCREASE OF ABOUT 1% IN CALIFORNIA AND ROMAN ACROSS THE SYSTEM EACH YEAR. DISTRIBUTED ACROSS CAMPUS IS BASED ON RECENT GROWTH TRENDS. WE ALSO SING THE CAMPUSES WOULD MAINTAIN A TWO TO ONE FRESHMEN TO TRANSFER RATIO AMONG NEW STUDENTS. AND THAT NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT WOULD INCREASE GRADUALLY AMONG CAMPUSES THAT HAVEN'T ALREADY HITTHEIR NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT CAP UNDER A REGION'S POLICY. WE CAN COMPARE THAT BASE CASE SCENARIO AGAINST A 10% SCENARIO WERE NEW NONRESIDENT FRESHMAN GRADUALLY FALL 210% OF INCOMING FRESHMEN BY. TWENTY NINE DISPLAY FIVE SHOWS THE ROMAN PROJECTIONS THAT RESULT UNDER BOTH AREAS. UNDER THE BASE CASE SCENARIO FROM FIRST YOU CAN SEE THAT TOTAL RESIDENT ENROLLMENT. PROS FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND AND TWENTY NINE THIRTY A GROWTH OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. YOU'RE ON THAT DISPLAY FIVE DISPLAY FIVE THAT'S RIGHT YOU'LL SEE THE THAT THE TOP PART BASE CASE THERE'S A SECTION THERE FOR TOTAL ENROLLMENT. AND YOU CAN SEE THE CATTLE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT CORRECT COMING FROM. ONE NINETY TWO TO ONE NINETY NINE UNDER THE 10% IN ARE YOU FROM BELOW. NON RESIDENTS DECLINE FROM 19%. OF THE INCOMING FRESHMEN CLASS IN. 2021210% AND TWENTY NINE THIRTY UNDER THIS SCENARIO TOTAL CALIFORNIA RESIDENT CLOSE BY ABOUT THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND OVER THIS PERIOD. BUT AS WE SHOULD EARLIER THAT HIGHER GROWTH COMES AT A VERY SUBSTANTIAL POSSIBLE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MORE DISPLAY. SIX FOCUSES ON THAT CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AND ROMAN UNDER BOTH SCENARIOS AND THE COST THE INCREMENTAL COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE 10%. ONE HERE YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT OF THE 10% SCENARIO ON CALIFORNIAN ROMAN EACH YEAR COMPARED TO THE BASE CASE. SUGG THE BASE CASE IS GOING UP BY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR. ACTUALLY THE THE BASE CASES BYE BYE OVER THIS PERIOD WE SAID 1% A YEAR. WHAT'S THAT WHICH IS ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED OR SO ON AVERAGE. AND AGAIN THESE ARE BASED ON A REASONABLE PROJECTION NOT NOT ON CAMPUS SPECIFIC PLANS ADDRESS THOSE DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST. SO THAT'S THE BASE CASE -- THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE ADDITIONAL AROMA THAT YOU SEE UNDER THE 10% SCENARIO -- YOU'LL SEE THAT IT GROWS EACH YEAR IT'S DROPS OFF RELATIVELY MODEST BUT IS A MUCH LARGER BY THE TIME YOU GET. TWENTY NINE THIRTY WE ALSO SHOW THEM THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF THAT 10% SCENARIO AND IT HERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THIS IS THE COST IN ADDITION TO THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND BASS BUT ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY BUILT INTO THAT BASE CASE. THIS IS ON TOP OF THAT. ARE THE STATE WOULD NEED TO INVEST AND AND WE CAN BE BASICALLY LOOK AT WHAT IS THAT INCREMENTAL CALIFORNIAN ROMAN. THE FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THREE STUDENTS IN THE FIRST YEAR WHICH THEN GROWS. TO THE INCREMENTAL COST UNDER THE PLAN. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THE STATE WOULD NEED TO INVEST ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT AT THE START OF THE PLAN. RISING TO ALMOST FIFTY TWO THOUSAND BY THE END. THAT'S THE COMBINED IMPACT. OF THE MARGINAL COST OF IN ROWING ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. OF REPLACING THE LOS NONRESIDENT TUITION. AND FUNDING THE ADDITIONAL UC GRANTS AND CAL GRANTS TO PRESERVE AFFORDABILITY FOR THE STUDENTS. IF THE COST WERE NOT FULLY COVERED BY ADDITIONAL STATE SUPPORT THERE WOULD BE REAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO CAMPUSES AND STUDENTS. AS NOTED IN THE REPORT ITSELF NOT REPLACING THE LOST INTEREST HE REVENUE AT BERKELEY FOR EXAMPLE WOULD LEAVE THAT CAMPUS WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL. IN TWENTY NINE THIRTY ALONE. THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO THE SALARY AND BENEFITS FOR SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE FULL TIME FACULTY POSITIONS. IF FUNDING WERE NOT PROVIDED FOR YOU SEE GRANTS FOR CAL GRANTS THE IMPACT WOULD BE FELT ON CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS THROUGH HIGHER LEVELS OF STUDENT DEBT. I HOPE THAT PROVIDES A SUBCOMMITTEE WITH SOME HELPFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE REPORT AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY. SO ON THE SCENARIO OF COST PER STUDENT. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IN A FOR EVERY STUDENTS THAT WE DO THIS CHANGES ADDITIONAL. FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ROUGHLY THAT'S RIGHT YEAH. SO YOU SOMEONE SOMEONE PROBABLY THE FLIP SIDE THAT HE BE. YOU WOULD ARGUE BE BETTER OFF TO FOCUS ON THE EXISTING. KAPOR RATIO AND FUN ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIAN ROMAN CROSS YOU GET MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK YEAH I THINK THE QUESTION THIS THIS BEGS IS EXACTLY THAT SORT OF WHAT'S THE THE BEST USE FOR THOSE FUNDS -- IS IT TO FULLY FUND -- BETWEEN SURE THAT WE CAN FIND -- ADEQUATE LEVELS OF CALIFORNIAN GROWTH EVEN WITHOUT TO THIS REDUCTION AND NON RESIDENT STUDENTS -- IS IT TO HELP RESTORE SOME OF THE INDICATORS OF ACADEMIC QUALITY THAT WE'VE SEEN WHICH I KNOW HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE -- THINGS LIKE -- DECLINING A STUDENT SATISFACTION WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU SEE INCREASED DIFFICULTY IN GETTING TO THE MAJORS THAT THEY WANT. OTHER ISSUES WAS RELATED TO ACADEMIC -- SUPPORT AND THROUGHPUT AND STUDENT SUCCESS SO THERE'S ONE I THINK FLYING ALL THIS IS WE NEED AS WE KNOW. WE DO HEAR FROM EXISTING YOU SEE STUDENTS COME UP HERE AND SAY HEY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING. MY LITTLE SISTER IN THE SEATS ABOUT MAKING SURE I HAVE A PLACE TO GO STUDY AND I CAN GET MY COURSE OFFERING AND I HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE AND ALL JUST TO JUST THE BASICS AND SO. THE CURRENT POLICY WE HAVE THIS -- SO CALLED CAP IT'S REALLY A RATIO SO IT'S THAT ONE TO FOUR RATIO FOR EVERY. 20% REQUEST RATIO SO FOR EVERYONE -- NON RESIDENT YOU NEED TO ENROLL -- FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS RIGHT CENTER THAT'S THE MATH RIGHT YEAH AND SO -- THAT DIDN'T DIDN'T THE NOTION. OF THAT IN IN YOUR ARGUING FOR THE UC I WOULD THINK THAT NOW WE SHOULD JUST CONTINUE THE CURRENT POLICY. AND FIND MORE ENROLLMENT GROWTH. BUT THAT -- ASSUMES THAT THERE IS CAPACITY TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND AND AND THIS POLICY. WOULD WOULD WOULD DEAL WITH THE PHYSICAL SPACE ISSUE RIGHT BECAUSE THE REGARDLESS OF MONEY THERE'S A DOES THAT JUST A NOTE HOW MNY SEATS YOU HAVE IN THIS. IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW RIGHT. AND SO. DOES THAT TAKEN TO CONSIDER THAT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ISSUE. WELL YES I THINK IT DOES SORT OF RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHAT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE LONG TERM WAY TO DEAL WITH SPACE CONSTRAINTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IS IT TO ADDITIONAL NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AND THEIR BY CREATING SOME SPACE WITH AN EXISTING FACILITY. WITH THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES WITH THEIR SIZE MATTRESS AT CETERA UP OR IS IT TO INVEST IN LONG TERM GROWTH OF FACILITIES THROUGH WHETHER IT'S A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND OR JUST SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF ITS OWN CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND EXPANSION. USING THE AB NINETY FOUR PROCESS UP IF IF WE THINK SORT OF STRATEGICALLY NOT JUST DURING THIS TEN YEAR PERIOD BUT EVEN BEYOND UP WHAT'S THE RIGHT LONG TERM WAY TO ADDRESS WHAT WILL BE LONG TERM NEEDS AROUND CAPACITY AT THE UNIVERSITY. AND THEN I REALIZE THAT -- YOU KNOW I I WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO TO DO THIS TO GO BACK TO THE POLICY. THAT WE HAD IN -- BASICALLY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAD ABOUT A 10% NON RESIDENT GROWTH AND I FLATLY REJECT THE NOTION THAT WE'RE DOING THIS FOR MORE. DIVERSITY BECAUSE FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS YOU SEE WAS TOTALLY GREAT WITH EXISTING GREAT DIVERSITY FROM. FRANKLY THE CALIFORNIA DIVERSITY -- SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT SIMPLE MY SIMPLE NOT ECONOMICS IN OUT YOU HAD TO DO THIS TO KEEP. THE LIGHTS ON DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND WE GET THAT AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE THE GREATEST PUSH BACKS THAT THE WILL THE WITH THE WILL PUT OUT IS THAT. EVEN AFTER WE STARTED GIVING. EIGHT SUMS OF MONEY THE LAST FIVE YEARS -- MAYBE AS MUCH AS YOU SEE WAS ASKING FOR YOUR BUDGET REQUEST BUT WELL WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. THESE NON RESIDENT NUMBERS KEPT GOING UP AND UP AND UP AND I THINK AT SOME POINT THE POLICY. WAS -- WAS ENOUGH AND AND THAT'S KINDA -- THE FOCUS ON BUT BUT THE ISSUE HERE THOUGH IS THAT YOU KNOW EVEN IF WE DID GO BACK -- AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO TO LEVERAGE AT THE HIGH LEVERAGE SITUATION IN THE NEXT LET'S SAY FOUR YEARS TO GET UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION A YEAR. IF WE DID THAT THAT'S THAT'S AT THE EXPENSE OF SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT. TO TO FOCUS ON OUR DEBT FREE COLLEGE PLAN TO DRESS FINANCIAL AID TO POTENTIALLY MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THE USE THE UC ISSUE SO THERE IS A RISK INVOLVED HERE WE WE WE OUGHT WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED. TO CERTAINLY -- EVALUATE -- WELCOME BACK IN A SEC BUT FOR NOW MISTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER OCT OFFICER YES. SO -- BOTTOM LINE IT IN THIS REPORT YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT -- IN ORDER -- FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENGAGE IN A TEN YEAR PLAN. TO GET US BACK -- TO NO MORE THAN 10%. SYSTEM WIDE OF A NON RESIDENTS THEY WOULD COST FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S CORRECT -- NAY BUT THAT. BUILT INTO THAT NUMBER ARE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU STARTED OUT WITH -- THAT -- NG INCLUDING THE THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF YOU SEE FINANCIAL AID AND INCREASED COSTS OF CAL GRANTS AS WELL AS A LOSS OF NON RESIDENT TUITION. AND FUNDING ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA GROWTH THAT'S CORRECT OKAY -- A A YOU KNOW I MEAN I I I HAVE TO ADMIT I I I ALWAYS FEEL THAT. I OFTEN FEEL THAT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- BUDGET REQUEST THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MOVING PIECES THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GET A YOU KNOW. MM MM PERHAPS I YOU KNOW I I NEED TO HEAR -- YOU KNOW AND AND PERHAPS HAVE HAVE A SEPARATE MEETING IN TERMS TO TRY TO DIVE INTO. POTENTIAL ALTERNATES INTO THESE NUMBERS BUT I'M I'M LOOKING AT THE THE STAFF A AND NOW SAYS FOR TODAY'S COMMITTEE HEARING AND AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THERE THERE'S TO SISTER CAN HEAR THAT KIND OF JUMPS OUT TO ME THAT -- THAT IN AS RECENTLY AS JUST TEN YEARS AGO 200-082-0009 ACADEMIC YEAR. SYSTEM WIDE THE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WERE ONLY ABOUT 5%. OF OUR OF OUR STUDENTS. AND AND AND TODAY -- WORK OR ABOUT 18%. AND SO I I JUST HAVE A HARD TIME. YOU KNOW. UNDERSTANDING WHY WE WOULD. YOU KNOW IT NOT IN THE NOT EVEN TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE TEN YEARS AGO BUT BUT TO GET. 210%. OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS THAT IT WOULD COST A FOUR POINT TWO IT WILL BE A FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR OBLIGATION ECLIPSING THE ENTIRE -- YOU KNOW STATE GENERAL FUND BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM ME JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. SO REMEMBER SOMETHING ARE MEANT CITY THE AMONG THE FOUR POINT TWO MILLION FIGURE IS NOT. THE ANNUAL INCREASE IN THAT LAST YEAR IT'S THE IT'S THE SOME OF THE ANNUAL INCOME SAYS ALONG THE WAY THANK YOU -- SECONDLY YOU KNOW WE THIS ACTUALLY -- HARKENS BACK TO A COMMENT YOU MADE EARLIER. ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT -- WHY EVERYONE IN THE CLOCK IN SUCH A SENS IS SO EXPENSIVE IS BECAUSE AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER PART OF THAT GROWTH AND NON RESIDENT ROMAN I THINK A LARGE PART OF IT WAS? AS CHAIR MCCARTY MENTIONED IN RESPONSE TO FUNDING SHORTFALLS AT THE CAMPUSES. AND SO ON DOING THAT. INCLUDES NOT JUST FUNDING THE COST OF EDUCATING A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT IN LIEU OF THAT NON RESIDENT BUT IN ESSENCE. UNDOING THE SUBSIDY FROM NON RESIDENTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROVIDING SINCE THEN RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S ESSENTIALLY DOING WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER -- BUYING RULING A DIFFERENT MIX OF STUDENTS -- AND IT IS PRICEY BECAUSE WE'RE ESSENTIALLY -- REDUCING THE SUBSIDY THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS ALREADY GETTING FROM NON RESIDENTS AND ESSENTIALLY REPLACING THAT WITH STATE TAXPAYER SUBSIDY. YEAH THERE IS SO AND SO I I I GET THE BASIC PICTURE THAT -- THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO REDUCE OR INCREASE THE PROCESS THE THE PROPORTION OF CALIFORNIA KIDS ATTENDING A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THAT IT WOULD. TAKE GREATER -- STATE GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS -- YEAH I I'M I'M JUST. TO A LITTLE HEALTHY SKEPTICISM ABOUT THIS FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR -- PRICE TAG TO TO COMP CYCLE -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. YEAH I JUST THINK THAT ILLUMINATES HOW MUCH WE WE CHARGE FOR NON RESIDENT ROMAN AND I SUPPORT THAT MEASURE FOR THE REGION'S THIS WEEK I THINK IT'S THAT THE SOUND ONE I THINK THERE'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY. MORE -- YOU KNOW -- MORE ANGST FROM YOUR STUDENT POPULATION ABOUT THIS BUT THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO YOU SAID IT WAS ONLY 5% NON RESIDENTS NOW IS 20% OF MORE THE STUDENTS ARE PART OF YOUR CONSTITUENCY. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS THAT EVEN AS WE'VE INCREASE ENROLLMENT -- I'M SORRY EVEN AS WE MAKE CREASE THE NON RESIDENT -- TUITION A NUMBER OF THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FROM THE UC. INTERNATIONALLY AND ACROSS THE THAT THE THAT THE US CON CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES -- HAS INCREASED CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT YEAH WHAT WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS ON ON THAT AS FAR AS THE THAT THE STUDY -- CLIP OF NON RESIDENT SUPPLYING. OUT WELL WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TRENDS BOTH IN APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS IN YIELD RATES. WE DON'T SEE MUCH CHANGE OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS EVEN WHEN WE DID HAVE -- INCREASES IN ON RESIDENTS OF MEL TUITION -- RE ANECDOTALLY WE WE KNOW THAT CAMPUSES ARE CONCERNED AS TO AT WHAT RATE COULD WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE -- NON RESIDENT TUITION WITHOUT SAYING A DROP OFF IN APPLICANTS. AND AS YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO BE ADMITTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAP FROM THE CAMPUS OF THOSE NON RESIDENTS NEED TO COMPARE FAVORABLY TO THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WERE AT THAT CAN SO IT'S A IT'S A HIGH BAR -- WE DO THINK THAT THE PLAN THAT'S BEING PRESENTED TO THE REGENTS A TOMORROW. AT WHICH IS TO ESSENTIALLY KEEP THAT INCREASE PEGGED GENERALLY TO THE RATE OF INFLATION WHICH BASICALLY HOLES AT FLAT AND CONSTANT DOLLARS -- BOTH PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED REVENUE WITHOUT PROVIDING A MATERIAL A BARRIER TO ENROLLMENT OR TO SUCCESS FOR THOSE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WE ALREADY HAVE. AND THAT KIND OF AN INFLATION BASED ADJUSTMENT IS BUILT INTO THE LONG TERM FUNDING PLAN THAT WE SHARED WITH THE REGION'S IN MARCH. WE WE HAVE -- INCREASED IT BY A GREATER RATES IN THE PAST. WHEN WE LOOKED TO SEE AND THIS IS MENTIONED IN THE REPORT -- WHAT KIND OF INCREASES WOULD BE NECESSARY -- AMONGST OUR SMALLER POPULATION OF NON RESIDENTS IF WE WERE TO REDUCE IT. IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOST NONRESIDENT REVENUE IT WOULD REQUIRE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES OF ABOUT 7% -- FOR THIS THE TEN YEAR PERIOD. IT WOULD MAKE THE TUITION INCLUDING NOT JUST NON RESIDENT TUITION BUT BASS TUITION A BECAUSE THE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR NON RESIDENTS. RIDLEY ALREADY WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR TUITION AS WELL OF COST OF LIVING -- MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOR NON RESIDENTS IN THE COUNTRY A MERCED RIVERSIDE SEVERAL OTHERS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THEN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA -- SO WE ARE MINDFUL OF AT WHAT POINT DO WE TIP THE SCALES AND AND SEE THAT. WE IN FACT ARE DRIVING STUDENTS AWAY AND WE CAN'T ACTUALLY SO THE THE 10%. PROPOSAL FOR TOMORROW. 10% NON RESIDENT TUITION INCREASE EVERY SENSE IT'S A IT'S A NO IT'S A IT'S A TWO POINT 6%. TO POINTS RIGHT IT'S AN INFLATION BASED INVESTMENT THAT YOU'RE AN EXTRINSIC DALY SAID WHAT WHAT WAS IS WHAT YOU SAY 10% THEN. I'D I'D A DID I I DON'T OKAY I DIDN'T MEAN TO IF I DID I HAVE YET [inaudible] OKAY AT SO YES IT WOULD I SUPPORT THAT WE THE WAY I THINK WE SUPPORT THAT -- THE CONSCIOUSNESS WE'VE HAD WAS YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP HERE AND LEGISLATURE ON THIS ISSUE -- IN THE SUMMER SAID OF COURSE. CAN SPEAK FOR THE SENATE. ONE THING THAT THAT I WOULD YOU WANT TO RAISE THE NOTION OF THE FINANCIAL AID. AND THE YOU KNOW. A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION AS FAR AS THE THE UC. THE RETURN THE RETURN EIGHT ON TUITION A THIRD OF THE TUITION GOES BACK FOR FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND YOU'RE USING SOME OF THAT FOR TO GET FINANCIAL AID FOR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW WE THOUGHT THAT WAS. INAPPROPRIATE SO DID -- THAT THE CONCLUSION WITH WITH THAT YOU YOU SEE LEADERSHIP AND YOU'RE LOOKING TO TO GO BACK AND AND UNRAVEL THAT ARRANGEMENT SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT -- YES I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE IT THAT WAY BUT IT WOULD BE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM THE LEGISLATURE WAS THAT -- TUITION THE BASE FEE PAID BY ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING NON RESIDENTS A PORTION OF THAT WAS BEING USED TO REDUCE -- FINANCIAL BURDENS ON NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AND THAT THERE IS A HIGHER BETTER USE FOR THOSE DOLLARS WHICH IS TO SUPPORT ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND WE MADE THAT -- CHANGE AND HAVE BEEN PHASING OUT THE STUDENTS ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT -- EVER SINCE THE ENTERING CLASS OF SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE ISSUE THAT'S ON THE TABLE NOW IS ONLY ABOUT THE MARGINAL. NONRESIDENT TUITION REVENUE NOT THE BASE TUITION AVENUE BUT THE MARGINAL WE CALL AND R. S. T.. THAT WOULD BE DERIVED FROM THE PROPOSED INCREASE. FROM FROM FROM THIS SMALL TWO POINT 6% ACCESS. AND 7% OF THIS 2% INTEREST SO NOT A DIFFERENT BEFORE BECAUSE THAT WAS THE FINANCIAL AID OVERALL FOR EVERYBODY YOU'RE USING SOME OF THAT TO FOCUS ON NON RESIDENT STUDENTS THAT'S CORRECT SO ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS THAT -- UNIVERSE ACTUALLY PROPOSING AT A SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY DOT TWO DOLLAR INCREASE FOR A NON RESIDENT STUDENTS -- IN TO A SMALL EXTENT. SOME OF THOSE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WILL BE CONTRIBUTING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT A TO HELP OFFSET THE COSTS FOR OTHER NON RESIDENTS DID YEAH AND WHAT ARE THE WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR THAT WHAT. WELL OUR CONCERN WAS EXPRESSED YOU MIGHT GIVE ME COULD PAINT A PICTURE OF THE STUDENTS AND IT'S I KNOW THAT. I WANT TO GET TO THIS THE SECOND THERE ARE SOME HYPOTHETICALS ABOUT SOME -- SEVEN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO WERE PAYING NON RESIDENT TUITION AND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS JUST A BLABBER THAT WAS A GREAT NUMBER. CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WAS REYES WE THINK THOSE ARE ACTUALLY VERY FEW STUDENTS BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR AN INTEREST EXEMPTION FOR UNDER EIGHTY FIVE FORTY IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TO FINANCE. YOUR EDUCATION EITHER ACTS OUT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO HAVE THE STATUS OF THAT WAS INACCURATE AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT WE IT PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE VERY UNLIKELY THAT YOU WOULD SEE THAT TO HAPPEN YES I THINK THERE WAS. ONE UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE MAGNET BUT WAS THERE A EXAMPLE OF IN THAT SCENARIO I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT THE I DON'T WANNA SAY THAT THERE'S NOBODY AT THE UNIVERSITY BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE NUMBER IS LIKELY TO BE -- WITHIN THE LOW DOUBLE DIGITS BUT SAY OKAY -- TO NOW THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED THAT WAS THAT THERE ARE A NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WHO -- WHETHER THEY'RE FROM OTHER STATES OR FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THAT MAY FOR WHATEVER REASON FIND THEMSELVES IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS -- IN THE CASE OF AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT MIGHT BE THE EXAMPLE RAISED IF THERE'S A ECONOMIC TURMOIL AT THEIR HOME COUNTRY -- ARE UNKNOWN RESIDENTS TO FOR WHATEVER REASON THERE'S THERE THERE THERE REALLY STRETCHING THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND YOU SEE ALREADY. I'M WE WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A THAT THAT NUMBER IS A PARTICULARLY LARGE AND WE SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF NON RESIDENT TO TAKE OUT A STUDENT LOAN. YEAH IT'S ABOUT 10%. AND SO THAT'S ONE GOOD INDICATION THAT IT IS OUT OF LESS NEEDY POPULATION THAN THAT THE POPULATION AT LARGE BUT NEVER WAS THERE IS INTERESTING IT OPEN IN HAVING AT LEAST A PORTION OF THIS REVENUE AVAILABLE TO HELP THE STUDENTS AND TIRED. AND THEN -- LASTLY THAT THE THE REVENUE THAT WHICH BE GENERATED BY THIS INCREASE -- WHERE WOULD I GO WHAT IT GOT HELP IN ROME MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS? NO IT IS ALREADY IN THE SENSE ACCOUNTED FOR IN OTHER PARTS OF OUR BUDGET REQUEST AS AS MR SALTED MENTIONED. IN OUR BUDGET PLAN WE DO HAVE OTHER REVENUE SOURCES INCLUDING AND RST -- BUT THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING WE'RE SEEKING FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER. EXPENDITURE INCREASES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE OF THE LEDGER YEAH WELL THE REASON I ASK THAT IS BECAUSE IT HAD YOUR ANSWER IS YOUR ANSWER BUT IT'S SOMEWHAT UNSATISFACTORY TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU'VE MADE. OVER THE YEARS AS BY ENROLLING MORE NON RESIDENTS WE'RE GOING TO HELP AND MORE. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SEE WOULD THINK THAT. ADDITIONAL REVENUE WOULD GO NOT TO MAKE IT EQUAL OUT FOR THAT POPULATION BUT HELP. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS GROW WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY SAID THAT IS HELP SUPPORT IN ROMAN OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND I'LL SHOW YOU ONE WAY IN WHICH IT WILL HELP -- IF HE WOULD LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS IS KIND OF A A DISTURBING TREND BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AMONG CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AT NEARLY EVERY UC CAMPUS. THE PERSISTENCE RIGHT AFTER ONE YEAR HAS DECLINED. SO IN OTHER WORDS WE'VE HAD A HIGHER PERCENTAGE AND IT'S NOT HUGE BUT IT'S WE FEAR THAT IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE CAMEL'S NOSE UNDER THE TENT. OF OF A CHANGING OUTCOMES THAT WE FIND DISTRESSING AND THAT WE THINK IS AN INDICATOR FOR JUST THAT RATE OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS IN OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO CALIFORNIA'S MISTER. THAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO. REMAIN ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA THERE TO RE ENROLL IN CALIFORNIA THE SECOND YEAR AFTER BEING HERE THEIR FIRST YEAR. YOU SEEN OTHER INDICATORS OF DISTRESS AROUND THE STUDENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION OR A LESS ABLE TO GET INTO THEIR OWN MAJORS THIS IS YET ANOTHER ONE THAT WERE NOW SAYING AND IT'S AS I SAID IT'S FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS. AND WE THINK IT IS A CONCRETE INDICATOR THAT -- THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AND SO THIS FOR SOLDERING IRONS ALL THAT ALL THAT STUFF. WHETHER IT'S ACADEMIC ADVISING WHETHER ITS COURSE OFFERINGS I MEAN ALL OF THESE PLAY INTO -- WHAT MIGHT CAUSE A STUDENT -- TO TO NOT PERSIST AND SO THESE YOU KNOW THESE ARE IMPORTANT I THINK COMPELLING REASONS. IF WE IF WE WAIT TOO LONG WE WILL SEE THIS AND FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES AND ANOTHER LONGER TERM INDICATORS OF STUDENT SUCCESS SO I THINK IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE WOULD LOVE TO PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP ADDRESS AND RATHER THAN LATER AND AND MAKE SURE THOSE RESOURCES FOR THEIR OKAY -- I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON MESSAGING. OKAY THANK YOU THIS IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT. ALL RIGHT -- THEY'RE GONNA DO COMMUNITY COLLEGES NOW SO JUST DO THAT THE WORD WE CAN JUST KEEP GOING OKAY YEAH OKAY SO NOW WE'RE GOING -- TO GO. TO THE CSU. HOUSE OF THIS [inaudible] CSU [inaudible] YEAH. AND WE JUST JUST GOING TO NOTE THAT FOR THE I KNOW WE DO HAVE THE HASTINGS REPRESENTATIVE HERE -- YOU WE HEARD YOUR BUDGET A FEW WEEKS GOT A ROBUST CONVERSATION THERE'S A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT HERE. AND THAT WILL BE TAKE ACTION ON THAT NEXT WEEK BUT WE'RE WE'RE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS THAT THIS MORNING SO. YOU MAY BE DISPENSED THE COURT [inaudible] YES [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. REBEKAH KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF THERE ARE THREE ISSUES FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND TODAY'S AGENDA. FOR MAY REVISION PROPOSALS THE FIRST IS RAPID RE HOUSING THE MAY REVISION INCLUDE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT RAPID RE HOUSING OF HOMELESS AND HOUSING AND SECURE STUDENTS. THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS UPON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTMENT OF FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CSU TO ADDRESS STUDENT FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR PROJECT REBOUND WHICH WAS INCLUDED AT THE LEVEL OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. FOR NOW A TOTAL OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND PROPOSED FOR THE PROGRAM. AS DISCUSSED IN A PREVIOUS HEARING PROJECT REBOUND IS A PROGRAM PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE EITHER SEEKING TO ENROLL IN A CSU. OR ATTENDING PARTICIPATING CSU CAMPUSES. THE THIRD PROPOSAL IS THAT THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT A FIRST STAR FOSTER YOUTH. PROGRAM COHORT AT CSU SACRAMENTO. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ENABLE A HORDE OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FOSTER YOUTH TO ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES SUPPORTING LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. SUCH AS ACADEMIC COURSES FOR COLLEGE CREDIT SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES SERVICE LEARNING AND OTHER RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. LA UP. AUSTIN HOUSE IN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR GENDER LISTS THE MAIN MAY REVISE PROPOSALS FOR CAL STATE UNIVERSITY. THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAM AT C. S. U. AS WELL AS AT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA RACES SEVERAL ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. RAPID RE HOUSING IS A WIDELY USED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IN THE COUNTRY BUT IT DOES TEND TO BE COSTLY MODEL COMPONENTS INCLUDE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE. FOR RENT. FOR UP TO TWO YEARS AS WELL AS A PERSONAL CASE MANAGER. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS COSTLY AND THERE ARE SO MANY STUDENTS AT UC AND CSU REPORTING. HOUSING AND SECURITY. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- PROPOSE LEVEL FUNDING LIKELY WOULD ONLY SERVE A SMALL PROPORTION OF HOMELESS AND HOUSING AND SECURE STUDENTS AT AT THOSE SEGMENTS -- SO APPROVING FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSAL COULD CREATE LARGE OUT YOUR COST PRESSURES ON THE STATE. IT'S JUST SOMETHING A KID KEEP IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL YEAH. IN ADDITION AS THIS COMMITTEE HEARD IN HEARINGS EARLIER THIS SPRING THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. BASIC NEEDS PROPOSALS FOR UC AND CSU. SO LEGISLATURE IN ASSESSING THE RAPID RE HOUSING PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE PROPOSALS IN JANUARY IN THIS NEWS THESE NEW SET. SETS A PROPOSALS IN MAY WILL. WILL INTERACT AND SO YOU LEGISLATURE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE PROGRAMS WILL WORK IN A COHESIVE WAY RATHER THAN A SEPARATE SILER PROGRAMS. IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO FUND RAPID RE HOUSING THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE INFORMATION DETAIL ON THE PROPOSAL AS PROPOSED IN MAY JUST LAST WEEK. THERE IS NO DEFINITION OF RAPID RE HOUSING HOW THE MONEY WOULD GO OUT TO CAMPUSES HOW CAMPUSES WOULD IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS HOW THE RESULTS WOULD BE SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND SO ALL THAT INFORMATION WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE -- IN FRONT IF. THE LEGISLATURE TO FUND THIS PROGRAM. THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSED THE SECOND ISSUE ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF THE AGENDA PROJECT REBOUND JUST LAST MONTH AS WE NOTED THEN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL -- PROVIDES FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN BASE AUGMENTATIONS TO SEE ISSUES GRADUATION INITIATIVE WHICH IS INTENDED TO HELP STUDENTS PARTICULARLY AT RISK STUDENTS. COMPLETING THEIR DEGREES FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS REPRESENTS A 23% YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE -- BRINGING TOTAL FUNDING FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE PROVE THAT -- JANUARY PROPOSAL. TO RATHER THAN PROVIDING A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT FOR PROJECT REBOUND THE LEGISLATURE COULD INSTEAD ENCOURAGE CSU TO PRIORITIZE USING THIS MUCH. LARGER POTOF MONEY THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE MONEY TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. REGARDLESS OF HOW THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO FUND PROJECT REBOUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE. CONSIDER REQUIRING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO REPORT REGULARLY ON THE PROGRAM INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT CAMPUS IS SPEND ON THE STUDENTS GRADUATION OUTCOMES AND RECIDIVISM RATES. WITH REGARD TO THE THIRD ISSUE LISTED ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. LIKE THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL IN THE RAPID RE HOUSING -- THIS PROPOSAL -- TO FIND A COHORT OF HIGH SCHOOL FOSTER USE THIS -- FIRST STAR PROGRAM WOULD ONLY SERVE A SMALL SUBSET OF STUDENTS. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT THIRTY STUDENTS TOTAL OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD AND ONLY IT. IN SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY. SO THE PROPOSAL DOES RAISE EQUITY QUESTIONS AND EQUITY ISSUES FOR FOSTER YOUTH LIVING OUTSIDE OF SACRAMENTO. AS WELL AS FOSTER YOUTH LIVING IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA THAT THAT ARE NOT SELECTED -- AS PART OF THE THIRTY THAT WERE CHOSE. THEY COULD BE CHOSEN. SO WHERE THE LEGISLATURE TO WANT TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO FOSTER USE THROUGHOUT THE STATE COST OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T BE MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SO IT'S JUST THIS COST PRESSURE ISSUE SOMETHING AGAIN TO KEEP IN MIND FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS YOU DELIBERATE ON THIS ISSUE. THAT HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU CSU. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE C. ISSUES THOUGHTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE NEW PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION MY NAME IS RYAN STORM I REPRESENT THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. SO FIRST I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CSU APPRECIATES OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE C. ISSUES -- OR THE TRUSTEES BUDGET REQUEST. SO ITS CONTINUED SUPPORT OF HIS JANUARY PROPOSAL AT THAT MAY REFER AGE AT THE MAY REVISION -- WILL WILL CERTAINLY GO A LONG WAY -- BUT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S REVISED PROPOSAL WOULD -- AS BEST MENTION AN AS IDENTIFIED ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA -- THAT THAT PROPOSAL WOULD FUND ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST. FOR THE SEIZURE GRADUATION IT SHOULD HAVE. I JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ABOUT WHAT A FULLY FUNDED GRAD MISSION OF WILL DO. WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL THREE THOUSAND COURSE SECTIONS APPROXIMATELY. IN THE UPCOMING YEAR AND SERVE ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS OFFERING ADDITIONAL SEAT AT IN A CLASS. ALSO -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD SUPPORT A 2% ENROLLMENT INCREASE -- VERSES THE 5% INCREASE THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED THAT'S A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS -- SO WE STAND READY TO BETTER SERVE OUR CURRENT STUDENTS THROUGH THE GRAD MISCHIEF. AND SERVE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS WITH THE DISH ON ENROLLMENT FUNDING -- SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR -- DECIDE FULLY FUND THOSE COMPONENTS OF THE REQUEST -- MY SECOND SET OF COMMENTS RELATES TO THE NEW MAY REVISION ITEMS DESCRIBED IN ISSUE SIX IN ARTICULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE IN LA -- THE GOVERNOR'S MADE IT CLEAR -- THAT A PRIORITY FOR OF HIS IS TO INVEST MORE IN HELPING STUDENTS WITH THEIR WITH THE LARGEST. WITH LARGE CHALLENGES. AND WE AGREE THOSE GOALS ARE LAUDABLE. HOWEVER THERE IS A CHALLENGE HERE AND I THINK IT THIS GOES TO YOUR POINT EARLIER DURING THE UC IN THE C. ISSUE JUST AREN'T DURING THE UC ITEM. IN IN KEY IN THE IDEA OF KEEPING THE EYE ON THE PRIZE OR THE IDEA OF OF SPORTING UNIVERSITY. AND NOT BEING DISTRACTED BY A NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS THAT. THAT COULD BE GOOD AND BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR STUDENTS BUT REALLY DO NOT FIND THAT THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY. AND SO WE BELIEVE THE BEST APPROACH IS A FIRST FOR FIRST FOR THOSE COMPONENTS OF THE TRUSTEES BUDGET REQUEST TO BE FUNDED -- LIKE I MENTIONED GRAN ISSUED IN ROMAN -- EVEN CAPITAL IF THAT'S A POSSIBILITY -- WHEN THIS ISACCOMPLISHED MAKES SENSE TO PERSON AFTER THAT'S ACCOMPLISHED AND MAKE SENSE PURSUE THESE OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS THANK YOU? YES SO ARE YOU SAYING MR STORM THAT Q. YOU DON'T -- WELL YEAR PRIESTS OF THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING SOME OF THESE MONIES TO CSU YOU'D RATHER. A RE DIRECT THAT TO GENERAL CSU SUPPORT WELL I THINK THE IDEA HERE IS THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO FILL THE BUCKET OF THE BUDGET REQUEST FIRST FROM THE TRUSTEES AND AND AND THAT AND THEN ATTACK SOME OF THESE ISSUES THEY ARE YOU KNOW AS AS POINT OUT THERE. ARE SOME ISSUES ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER IS. IF YOU DO ESTABLISH A CERTAIN POPULATION OF STUDENTS RECEIVING EMERGENCY HOUSING OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT A NEED RIGHT ON THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS WE HAD A SURVEY DONE BACK IN BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND LATE SEVEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND INTO TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORTING. THAT ABOUT 10% OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION DEALS WITH A HOUSING AND SECURITY WILL EXTRAPOLATE THAT ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. SO ONE OF THE POINTS IN IN IN IN CONSIDERING THESE SORTS OF INVESTMENTS IS IF YOU DO CREATE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT THAT MIGHT REPRESENT YOU KNOW ONE TENTH OF THAT POPULATION. THEN IT CREATES A PRESSURE FREE IN THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER ABOUT UPCOMING RECESSION. OF OF ESTABLISHING MAYBE A GOAL OF TRYING TO TO HOUSE EVERY SINGLE STUDENT EVERY SENSE EVERY SINGLE WAY NOT HAVING TO THE ABILITY TO FUND THAT AS WELL AS MAYBE THE FOOD COURT TENANTS OF THE UNIVERSITY YEAH. JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. WELL SURE I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- IS KIND OF A RESPONSE THAT -- WE'RE SEEING FROM OUR COMMUNITIES AS FAR AS THE BASIC NEEDS THAT IF IT'S CRAZY TO THINK THAT. THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FOOD PANTRY AT SAC STATE YOU KNOW WE YOU WOULD NOT THINK THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO WALKING INTO SEX STATE MAYBE THAT HAVE SOME TYPE OF PROGRAM BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM A YOU KNOW ONE OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- FOOD PANTRIES AND IT'S FOR STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT INSIDE RECENTLY. I KIND OF SMILED THE LIKE WELL IS PRETTY COOL I ALSO WALKED AWAY PRETTY GUARD PRETTY DARN DEPRESSED LIKE WHY DO WE NEED THIS AT ISSUES YOU CAMPUS NOT JUST SHOWS. AT THE REALITIES AND SO. I THINK THAT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T IGNORE THAT AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS TO WHERE I THINK THIS. RAPID RE HOUSING. AND THE PROPOSAL IS IT ISN'T HOUSING PER SE IT'S LIKE HOW DO YOU GET SOMEBODY WHO'S. YOU KNOW ON THE VERGE OF DROPPING OUT. YOU KNOW WALKING AWAY TO GIVE THEM SOME TEMPORARY STABILITY. LIKE THESE YOU KNOW TEMPORARY MATTEL VOUCHERS TAKE TO GET SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW A BRIDGE TO GET TO SOMETHING ELSE AND I I THINK THAT'S HOW WE NEED TO VIEW THIS WE CAN'T THINK OF THIS AS HOUSING. CSU STUDENTS BUT PROVIDING YOU KNOW LACK OF BETTER TERM LIKE A BANDAID ON A SITUATION TO JUST HELP. STUDENTS IN CRISIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT. IT. MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ANXIETY -- IN A FOOD ISSUES HOUSING THOSE ARE ALL REAL FOR OUR CSU POPULATION MANY COME FROM EXTREMELY LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS YOU KNOW TO TWO THIRDS OR MORE ARE ON SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL AID CELL. IT'S NOT THAT THAT THE OTHER STUDENT POPULATION WERE SAYING THAT YOU SEE YOUR SOME OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS PER SE. SO I I THINK THERE IS THERE IS A NEED -- FOR AT SOME TYPE OF STATE INVESTMENT HERE LIMITED AND REALIZING THAT WE CAN'T TACKLE TACKLE EVERYTHING. I DID WANT AYE AYE MR DISCUSSION -- LAST MONTH AND FORTUNATELY ON ON PROJECT REBOUNDS AND I AM A SUPPORTIVE OF OF THIS. PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AS WE FOCUS ON OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. IN TRYING TO RE INTEGRATE PEOPLE BACK INTO. SOCIETY THAT THAT FOCUSES ON EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AND BEING GATED COMMUNITY BUT AS FAR AS EMPLOYMENTS WITHOUT KNOW THAT THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW ACQUIRED HIGHER EDUCATION AND HAS SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OF STUDENTS. A LOCAL EVEN PARTICIPATING IN THIS IN THESE PROGRAMS OBSCENE SOME HERE AT THAT SEX STATE SO -- WANT I KNOW WILL HAVE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT PROBABLY ABOUT THIS IN A BIT AND SO I DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO IT TO GO UP -- FROM TWO FIFTY TO I'M A MILLION WITH AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND I REALIZE THAT'S NOT THE FULL REQUEST I KNOW THEY HAD SOME ONGOING MONEY THAT WENT AWAY AND IT'S A GRANT PROGRAM FOR SAYING SO. YOU KNOW WE ARE EVALUATING THE NOTION OF OF OF OF THEIR THEIR TOTAL REQUEST BUT WANTED -- TO ASK YOU IF YOU WANTED TO COMMENT ON THIS PROGRAM. I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING -- YOU KNOW WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF PROJECT REBOUND -- AND I AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOME OF THE EARLIER POINT YOU MADE OBVIOUSLY WE HAD AS YOU AS UNIVERSITY ARE VERY STE. DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BE SUPPORT OF A RIVER STUDENTS IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND FOOD PANTRIES THAT SORT OF THING. OBVIOUSLY BY YOUR ATTENDANCE AT SEX STATE DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS AN EFFORT THEIR CHALLENGES THERE'S LIMITED RESOURCES RIGHT IN THE STATE AT THE UNIVERSITIES. AND SO YOU HAVE TO PRIORITIZE I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO PROJECT REBOUND I THINK -- THE POINT TO BE MADE WITH WITH THIS IS THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GRANTS -- PHILANTHROPIC GRANTED IS EXPIRING. AND LARGELY WHAT THE I DON'T WANNA BUT WORDS MY MOUTH MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM FINANCE BUT I THINK LARGELY THE INTENT HERE IS SYSTEM. IS TO BACK FILL THAT LOSS OF THAT GRANT FUNDING IN THAT SUPPORT THE PROGRAM PERMANENTLY. I THINK WE SEE THE VALUE IN MAINTAINING THE PROGRAM THERE'S A FANTASTIC I'D NEWS FROM THAT PROJECT. MANY OF THE STATE MANY OF YOUR STAFF HAVE BEEN ON ON VISITS -- TO TO EXPERIENCE BRIEFINGS ON THAT ANSWER VERY GOOD PROGRAM SO -- WE ARE DEFINITELY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PROGRAM. AND THEN LASTLY THE PROGRAM AT THAT CSU SACRAMENTO THE FIRST STAR FOSTER YOUTH ON I BEYOND CITY I I HADN'T HEARD OF THIS PROGRAM BEFORE IT WAS THAT. WRITTEN UP IN THE MAY REVISE LAST WEEK BUT WE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY ANY PROGRAMS THAT. SUPPORT OUR OUR OUR FOSTER YOUTH -- SCHOLARS IS THAT IS THAT IS AN IMPORTANT -- ENDEAVOR FOR CALIFORNIANS SO. I APPRECIATE THIS PROPOSAL FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- MR MURATSUCHI. SO -- MISTER STRONG MY I WANTED -- TO AS FOR A LITTLE CLARIFICATION. YOU YOU YOU YOU INDICATED THAT -- THAT -- WE SHOULD FOCUS ON ON FUNDING THEY THEY THEY THEY DID THE CORE MISSION -- THROUGH THE REQUEST. PROVIDED BY THE THE THE TRUSTEES BEFORE WE START FOCUSING ON THESE -- INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS -- SO. I MEAN THEY THAT THAT KIND OF GOES -- TO MY MY MY GENERAL CONCERN ABOUT. WHENEVER WE HIGHLIGHT THE SPECIAL PROGRAMS -- IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE LOSING SIGHT OF THE CORE MISSION AND AND WERE FOR WE'RE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ON YOU KNOW. SPECIFIC ISSUES I AND AND YOU KNOW GRANTED. WE WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY STUDENTS TALKING ABOUT -- TO HOMELESSNESS HOUSING AND SECURITY FOOD AND SECURITY -- THAT YOU KNOW WERE TRYING TO RESPOND TO THAT. AND YET. IT'S NOT AS CATCHY TO FOCUS ON THE CORE EDUCATIONAL MISSION -- IN AND THEN SO. I I GUESS YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE POLITICAL REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW SAY WELL WE PROVIDED YOU KNOW THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO TO TO YOU KNOW AND RESPONSE TO T. T. YOUR DEMANDS -- AND AND AND TRYING -- TO MAKE A DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCIES HAPPY -- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW IT'S THERE IS ALSO THE CONCERN THAT IF WE DON'T. SPECIFY THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS LIKE. HOUSING AND SECURITY THEN IT WON'T BE A WILL BE ADDRESSED SO GET GET CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT I MEAN LIKE YOU KNOW HOW HOW CAN. HOW WOULD WE BE ASSURED THAT THAT IF WE? FOCUSED ON ON FUNDING THE THE CORE -- MISSION THAT THAT THESE -- YOU KNOW SPECIFIC NEEDS WOULD NOT BE -- YOU KNOW AT ADDRESSED WELL I DON'T THINK WE I DON'T THINK THERE WE'RE IN A POSITION ANYBODY IN THE STATE NOR THE UNIVERSITIES ARE IN A POSITION TO MEET EVERY SINGLE NEED OF EVERY SINGLE STUDENT I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE REALITY OF IT. I THINK WHAT I'M WHAT I'M TRYING TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE HERE IS THAT. ULTIMATELY OUR OUR GOAL AS AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO EDUCATE STUDENTS. AND ONE THING THAT WE HAVE NOTICED -- IN MANY YEARS AND HAVE DONE THROUGH THE GRAD INITIATIVE LAUNCH IS TO REALLY. STATE CENTRALLY FOCUSED ON THE NOTION OF HAVING STUDENTS PERSIST AND GET THEIR DEGREE AT THE SAME TIME BEING ABLE TO GET THE COURSES THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO GRADUATE. AT THE TIME THAT THEY WANT TO GRADUATE. IDEALLY IF THEY WANT TO GRADUATE IN FOUR THEY AT GRADUATE FORTY ONE GRADUATE THREE THREE IF IT'S IF THEY'RE ON THE SIX YEAR PLAN INTENTIONALLY. THERE IS WELL. NOW THE GRANITE SHOULD HAVE DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS IN TERMS OF FUNDING IT LIKE I MENTIONED IT IT ADDS ADDITIONAL COURSES SO THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE STUDENTS. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE MORE THAN THE AVERAGE WHICH IS ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT THREE UNITS PER TERM NOW IF YOU DO THE MATH YOU NOT GONNA GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS IF EVERYBODY WAS IN THAT SITUATION. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR TENANTS THE OTHER PIECE OF IT. IS. ARE THESE OTHER PIECES RIGHT IT'S MEETING BASIC NEEDS. RIGHT IT'S BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO FOOD PANTRIES AND TO BE ABLE TO OFFER EMERGENCY HOUSING VOUCHERS. SO WE ARE TRYING TO DO SOME OF THAT AND CAMPUSES HAVE PLANS IN ACTION SO THAT THEY CAN. DO ALL OF THIS TRY TO ATTEMPT TO DO ALL OF THIS THE KNOCKING AT THE NOT GONNA MEET EVERY SINGLE NEED THOUGH THAT'S JUST NOT THE REALITY THAT'S NOT. THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. BUT I THINK WE WE WILL GET THERE THE OTHER THING TOO THAT IF YOU IF YOU ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS. COMPLETELY DOVE TAILS AND WHAT THE TRUSTEES REQUEST. IT'S FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME FOR BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVES. AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO IT ATTEMPT. TO MEET A LOT OF THESE NEED SO IT'S IT'S ALSO HOUSING BUT IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE HAVE AN AWARENESS AND HAVE THAT CONNECTION. TO A LOT OF OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WE HAVE. ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THE LOCAL LEVEL AND IN THE PHILANTHROPIC WORLD -- WE ARE PERFECTLY ALIGNED WITH EVERY SINGLE ENTITY THAT THAT CAN HELP STUDENTS WITH EXISTING MONIES THAT ARE ALREADY BUDGETED OUT THERE AND IN THE STATE BUDGET. AND SO THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF THAT FIFTEEN MILLION WILL DO IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE OF THAT. CAN ACTIVITY. OF OUR STUDENTS WITH THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED IN PARTICULAR. SO I THINK. ADOPTING THE THE BUDGET REQUEST AS WE'VE LAID OUT IS A LONG IS IS IS MILES AHEAD OF WHERE WE WOULD BE. BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDING MONEY ON GRANITE SHOULD BE ADDING MONEY ON BASIC NEEDS. AND THEN IF YOU DO WANT TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FUNDS LIKE PROPOSED BY THE IN THE ADMINISTRATION I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S IN ADDITION TO IN WOULD BE BE SUPPLEMENTAL TO AND AND ULTIMATELY WOULD BE WOULD BE -- SATISFIED WITH THAT AS WELL. ANY OTHER ON QUESTIONS MISTER GALLAGHER TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SO WHAT I'M SORRY I MISSED SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION -- BUT YOU KNOW ONE I I DO WANT TO AND I CREDIT. FOR WHAT THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE YOU KNOW AND BEING AHEAD OF THIS ISSUE IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH HOMELESS. AS STUDENTS AND COMMISSION IN THEIR STUDY AND SO IN A LOT OF WAYS I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW IN THIS DISCUSSION. IN IN FIGURING OUT HOW WE HOW WE DO THE FUNDING AND NOW WE DO THE BUDGET ON THIS WE SHOULD SAY LOOK THERE'S ARE A LOT THAT CSU. HAS ALREADY DONE AND IS DOING ON THIS FRONT. AND I AND I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING IS SAY YOU KNOW. I KINDA DON'T DON'T DON'T -- HAND CUFF AS BY SAYING HEY THIS IS JUST ONLY THIS MONEY AND AND KIND OF MAKING THIS. MONEY SORT OF JUST ATTACHED TO THAT PROGRAM MEAN. WHEN THEY'VE KIND OF ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND PROGRAMMING RIGHT -- AND AND THEN I ALSO HERE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THERE'S NO. MORE NEED TO THEY NEED FOR THEIR CORE MISSION -- WORK -- IS KIND OF WHAT I'M HERE AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US AS A COMMITTEE -- SEE IF WE CAN GIVE THEM SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY HERE BASED ON THE FACT THAT. THEY HAVE BEEN ADDRESS IN THIS YOU KNOW IT'S AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ANOTHER A WEATHER. AHEAD OF YOU SEE -- IN SCENE YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE IN AND TRYING TO ADDRESS IT -- I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I WOULD. I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAS YOU KNOW HOW OUR THE LIMITED NUMBERS OF FOSTER YOU SIR BY THIS -- BY THIS PROGRAM SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE. UNDER THE CURRENT PRO YOU ARE THE THE FIRST OUR PROGRAMS AT CSU SAMBAR ENDINO -- FOR EXAMPLE -- HOW ARE THOSE? YEAH HOW ARE THOSE FUNDED AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW DO WE SELECT WHO GETS TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE PROGRAMS [inaudible] SO. WE'VE SPOKEN WITH A FIRST OUR STAFF. ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND THERE ARE TWELVE ACADEMIES CURRENTLY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO IN CALIFORNIA U. C. L. A. AND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SAMBAR DINO. UNIVERSITY UTAH HAS WON THIS ONE YOU CONNECTICUT NOW THERE'S UNDERSTANDING FROM THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE FIRST OUR STAFF IS THAT THE UNIVERSITIES. HIRE A DIRECTOR AND THAT DIRECTOR WORKS FOR THE UNIVERSITY IS AN AND CHARTS AND IS IN CHARGE OF SELECTING. FOSTER USED TO BE IN THAT PROGRAM. AND FIRST ARE ACTUALLY HAS A SUGGESTED RUBRIC FOR CHOOSING -- THE FOSTER USE BUT BASICALLY THAT THE DIRECTORS WORK WITH THAT CHILD WELFARE WELFARE AND OTHER AGENCIES TO TO TRY TO IDENTIFY. INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE SUITABLE AN APPROPRIATE SUCCESSFUL IN THE PROGRAM. IT'S FUNDED THROUGH VARIOUS MEANS AS WELL BRUCE LOCAL MONEY SERVICE IN SOME STATES SOME STATE MONEY VARIOUS PHILANTHROPIC SO VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES. AND THEN HAS AND MAYBE YOU ALREADY ANSWERED THIS RATE HAS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALLOCATED IN THE ON GOING FUNDS -- FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS PROGRAM. ARE THESE PROGRAM IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE -- NOT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PER SE -- I'M NOT AWARE THAT PERHAPS IN BERNIE DINO HAS CONTRIBUTED SOME OF THEIR OPRY BUDGET FROM THEIR CAMPUS BUT I'M UNAWARE SPECIFICALLY WHAT IF ANY WHAT ABOUT FOR PROJECT REBOUND I THINK THAT WAS OF THAT THOSE MEXICO YEAH YEAH THERE'S WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IS ABOUT. I THINK IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS -- TO PROJECT REBOUND -- FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALSO -- THERE'S INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES ARE ARE CONTRIBUTING VERY SMALL. AMOUNTS IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. ON THEIR FROM THEIR PARTICULAR -- OPERATING BUT SUPPORT THE PROGRAM I THINK OVERALL -- THE THE PROGRAMS ABOUT ONE ONE MILLION ONE POINT TWO MILLION PER YEAR -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT MONEY THOUGH IS IS HAS BEEN -- HAS BEEN FROM -- THIS PARTICULAR PHILANTHROPIC ENTITY. THAT MONEY IS EXPIRING SOON AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS YOU HAVE IN ESSENCE BACK FILL OF THAT THE PHILANTHROPIC SIDE. AND MAYBE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING WHEN THAT WHEN WE DO THE MATH ON THAT THEY MADE YOU KNOW TURN OUT THAT IT'S YOU KNOW. A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY THAT COULD BE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. I THINK WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT CAMPUSES IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN OF THAT PARTICIPATE IN -- PRIDE AGREE ABOUT AT THIS POINT -- THE LARGEST PROGRAM IS AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE AND THERE ARE OTHER CAMPUSES THAT OR I JUST GETTING OFF THE GROUND WITH THAT PROGRAM -- AS WELL AS FOLKS OTHER CAMPUSES THAT ARE DEFINITELY INTERESTED BECAUSE OF THAT. THE GREAT SUCCESS THAT THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN AT SEVERAL SCHOOLS STATE OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS. IN THIS ROOM REALLY QUICKLY. SO MY EYES OF INITIAL COMMENTS THERE IS THAT IS THAT A PRETTY GOOD. SYNTHESIS OF WHAT YOU GUYS HER SANE WITH REGARD TO TAKE COMPLIMENTS ANY DAY. YEAH BUT I MEAN BUT AS A AS AT A SYNTHESIS OF WHAT YOU GUYS ARE ASKING ESSENTIALLY THAT HEY DON'T. WE ARE ALREADY DOING THIS. DON'T TARGET THIS MONEY IF IF WE COULD HAVE SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY AND HAVE THIS MONEY GO TOWARDS OUR CORE PROGRAM I THINK I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY ARE OUR POSITION IS THAT THE MORE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY OF MORE WE CAN PIVOT AND DO THINGS THAT ARE. UNIQUE NOT ONLY FROM A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO COULD BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE POTENTIALLY -- SO I WOULD SAY ONE EXAMPLE IS TO THE GRAD THE GRADUATION ISSUED OF WHAT WHAT CAMPUS IS DO AS THEY ESTABLISH A PLAN. AT THEIR LEVEL OF WHAT THEY ARE INTENDING TO DO. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMETIMES -- AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPEN WHERE THEY HAVE ACTUALLY PIVOTED. AND HAVE DECIDED WELL WE HAVE WE HAVE INVESTED IN THIS SO FAR AND WE ARE NOW WANTING TO PAY THAT AND AND INVEST A LITTLE BIT MORE. FOR EXAMPLE ON ONE CAMPUS THAT THE REAL DETRIMENT AT ON THE CAMPUS WAS A LACK OF ECONOMIC COUNSELING. RIGHT A GRAND ISSUED IF THE FUNDING THAT YOU PROVIDED BASICALLY SO HERE'S A BUNCH OF MONEY CAMPUS IS YOU DECIDE WHAT'S THE BEST NEED ON YOUR CAMPUS SO THIS PARTICULAR CAMPUS SAID WE HAVE WE WE NEED MORE ACADEMIC COUNSELORS TO ADVISE STUDENTS ON THE BEST PATH TO DEGREE. OKAY FIRST YEAR THEY PUMP IT ALL INTO THEIR QUE ALL THEIR MONEY GOES INTO ECONOMIC COUNSELING. SECOND YEAR GRAD MISSION OF FUNDING. THEY INVESTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN ADDITIONAL FACULTY SO NOW WE HAVE CANCERS IN PLACE WHICH IS A IN AN INCREDIBLE. LACK ON OUR CAMPUS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD MORE COURSE SECTIONS BECAUSE AS WE NEED TO DO. AND SO CAMPUSES ARE ARE ARE HAVE PLANS IN PLACE TO REALLY PUT MORE AND MORE MONEY IN STRATEGIC AREAS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY IF THE LEGISLATURE OR THE GOVERNOR DECIDE THAT YOU KNOW ALL THIS MONEY SHOULD BE THIS WAY AND ALL THIS MONEY SHOULD BE THAT WAY. THE CHALLENGES THAN THAN CAMPUSES CAN'T PAY THAT THEY HAVE TO SPEND MONEY. POR BUNCH MONEY INTO SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE GOOD BUT AT THE COST OF SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAY BE A CHALLENGE SO WE ARE ALWAYS ADVOCATES FOR ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY. THANK YOU SO. THEY AGAIN I I I I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT -- ON THIS IS SAME POINT ABOUT -- TO DIRECTING THE FUNDS FOR CORPS FOR CORE FUNDING TO PROVIDE THEM THAT MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY -- I KNOW YOU INDICATED THAT THAT YOU KNOW. PART OF THAT FLEXIBILITY WOULD BE TO ALLOW THE CSU CAMPUSES TO TAP INTO EXISTING COUNTY OR OTHER. POTENTIAL SOURCES OF OF OF OF FUNDING -- TO TO SUPPORT AND ADDRESSES HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY ISSUES WITH HOW WOULD WE BE ASSURED THAT THAT THE THE THESE NEEDS ARE BEING ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. WHILE THE SEE THROUGH REPORTING AND WE HAVE -- DONE -- A LITTLE BIT OF THAT TO BEGIN WITH WITH OUR EXISTING LIST OF OUR BASIC NEEDS SHOULD OF THERE ALSO IS ADDITIONAL. WORK BEING DONE NOW THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR THERE'S A BASIC NEEDS -- I GUESS FOR LIKE UBER WORD -- CONFERENCE THAT WE HOSTED -- IN SO WHAT YOU'RE HAVING IF YOU'RE HAVING A LOT OF ACTIVITY WHERE YOU'RE CONNECTING THE UNIVERSITY WITH THOSE OTHER ENTITIES BUT THEN ALSO -- THERE IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT TO REPORT ON ON WHERE WE ARE AND THINGS SO WE SUBMIT A REPORT EARLY THIS SPRING. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IF THERE IS -- CONTINUED -- FUNDING FOR THIS THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY CARRY THAT REPORTING LANGUAGE GOING FORWARD WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT HOW HOW WE'RE DOING ON THINGS. OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IF YOU I LIKE TO MOVE ON TO TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COMMUNICATIONS GOOD MORNING MICHELLE NEW IN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE ME REVISION CONTINUES THE REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA PROPOSED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND ALSO PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE HOLD HARMLESS. OF THE PROVISION OF THE FORMULA TO A FOURTH YEAR OR FISCAL YEAR. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO WORK WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMING MONTHS TO EXPLORE REVISIONS THE FORMULA TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA REPORTED BY DISTRICTS. ADDRESS THE FORMULAS LONG TERM FISCAL STABILITY AND HELP FURTHER THE GOALS OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. THE INTENT IS THAT THE REVISIONS BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET CYCLE. FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE MAY REVISION INCLUDE A PROPOSED THIRTY NINE POINT SIX MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO LARGELY REVERSES A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ADJUSTMENT THAT SWAPPED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION IN ONGOING RESOURCES FOR ONE TRUCK ONE TIME FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION IN FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM IS NOW MADEUP OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION. ON GOING FUNDS AND ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ONE TIME FUNDS. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO PROPOSES FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE FOSTER CARE EDUCATION PROGRAM TO SUSTAIN THE% PROGRAM'S CURRENT LEVEL OF FUNDING. BASED ON PROJECTED DECREASE IN FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS FOR THE PROGRAM. AND AS IS THE CASE FOR K. TWELVE THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A DECREASE OF TWENTY POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO REFLECT THE CHANGE IN THE COLA FROM THREE POINT 46% TO THREE POINT 26%. THIS CHANGE AFFECTS A PORTION MEN'S AND VARIOUS COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS. SIMILARLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A CHANGE FOR THE CAL STIRS SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT TO DECREASE THE CONTRIBUTION RATE FOR EMPLOYERS FROM EIGHTEEN POINT 13% TO SIXTEEN POINT 7% WHICH IS A ONE POINT 43% DECREASE. THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT IS NOW THREE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION IS ESTIMATED TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES. FOR STATE OPERATIONS THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING ON PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND FOR THREE NEW POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICES STATE OPERATIONS. THESE INCLUDE TWO POSITIONS FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICES ACCOUNTING SHOP AS WELL AS ONE POSITION TO MONITOR DISTRICTS FISCAL HEALTH AND TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR DISTRICTS AND NEED. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. VERY MUCH -- THE HELLO. EDGAR CABRAL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON TWO OF THE OF THE PROPOSES MOMMY REVISION. FIRST REGARDING THE PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION FOR A FOURTH YEAR. AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL WE DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY NEED TO EXTEND THE PRISON RIGHT NOW. THE THE AS THE ADMINISTRATION -- NOTED THAT THEY ARE NOT -- PURSUING ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO THE FORM OF THAT THIS TIME AND MOST OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE MIRROR VISION. WE WOULD ARGUE ARE ACTUALLY CREATE MORE STABILITY IN IN IN THE FORMULA SO WE WE DON'T THINK THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY A REASON TO EXTERNAL HARM IS AT THIS TIME. THAT THE EXTENDING IT DOES CREATE SOME COST PRESSURE IN THAT FOURTH YEAR. AND SO -- IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE PRESSURE BUT PROBABLY IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO WE DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON TO DO THAT NOW IF IN JANUARY WITH THERE IS A PROPOSAL FOR A BIGGER FORMER BIGGER CHANGES WE THINK AT THAT TIME YOU COULD CONSIDER. WHETHER YOU WANTED TO EXTEND THAT. IN TERMS OF THE STATE OPERATIONS -- WE HAVE NO SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE PARTICULAR POSITIONS BUT WE DO CONTINUE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT WITH TRANSPARENCY FROM THE CHANCES OF AND HOW IT HAS. SPENT MORE RECENT AUGMENTATIONS THE OFFICES RECEIVED TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN AUGMENTATIONS OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. OF THE DATE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CáC. CLEAR INDICATION OF HOW THOSE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN USED AS A WITH OTHER INFORMATION WERE CONCERNED THAT ANY FURTHER AUGMENTATIONS MIGHT NOT BE USED FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSES SO -- OUR RECOMMENDATION -- WOULD BE TO TO FIND A NEW POSITION TO REQUIRE HAVE THOSE POSITIONS BE FILLED WITH EXISTING RESOURCES -- WHETHER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU TAKE OUR APPROACH OR YOU DO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE MIRROR VISION WE WOULD RECOMMEND ADDING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE -- THAT SPECIFIES EXACTLY WHAT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS TO BE USED FOR IT TO SPECIFY BOTH POSITIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A CLEAR EXPECTATION OF HOW THE FUNDING SHOULD BE USED. AND WE ALSO -- THE LEGISLATURE ALSO MAY WANT TO CONSIDER REQUIRING THE CHANCES OFFICE TO REPORT I ALWAYS SPENT THESE MOST RECENT BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS. I'M JUST SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS A BETTER SENSE OF HOW FUNDS OF IN SPENT AND HOW I CAN BETTER ASSESS FUTURE OF BUDGET PROPOSALS. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHRISTIAN US WHEN IF FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE MAY REVISION -- WITH REGARD TO THE STUDENTS UNDER CENTER FUNDING FORMULA AGAIN WE THANK THE GOVERNOR. OF FOR THE PROPOSAL'S HE'S MADE -- TO CONTINUE IMPLEMENTATION -- JUST TO BEGIN FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE WOULD ARGUE. THAT WE REALLY SHOULD BE HOLDING IT -- COMMUNITY COLLEGES HARMLESS -- FOR ANY CHANGES IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT KAREN T.. BOTH YOU KNOW I THINK THE PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A RECENT HEARINGS WAS AROUND PROPERTY TAXES -- WE ALSO THINK THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAN FOR THE AMOUNTS. THAT THE FORMULA HAS GENERATED TO DATE FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN UNDER CURRENT LAW. YEAH THE FISCAL YEAR ENDS I BELIEVE FORTY FIVE DAYS FROM NOW IF I GOT MY DATES CORRECT AND SO. YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WE'RE ARGUING IS THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WOULD MAKE NO CHANGES TO THE FORMULA FOR THE CURRENT YEAR -- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS. POTENTIALLY ONE TIME FUNDING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN FIND DISTRICTS FOR WHAT WE'VE -- BUT THE FORMULA HAS GENERATED TWENTY AND BEYOND -- WE ARE COMFORTABLE -- WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETY OR EXCUSE FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WERE COMFORTABLE BUT THE PROPOSAL SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL. TO CHANGE THE RATES IN THE FUNDING FORMULA -- TO TO GENERATE ABOUT EIGHT SEVENTY TWENTY TEN SPLIT WE ARE ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE EXISTING HOLD HARMLESS. THREE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WITH REGARD TO OTHER PROPOSALS THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES IN THE MAYOR OF FISH AND WE WOULD REQUEST SOME ALTERNATIVE SPECIFICALLY RELATED -- TO THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION ONE THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE INCLUDING BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO COUNT ONLY THE HIGHEST AWARD AS PART OF THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION. WE SPECIFICALLY REQUEST THAT -- AS PART OF THE FUNDING FORMULA MOVING FORWARD WE WOULD HELP THE HIGHEST OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR CHANCE FOR THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE THE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE OTHER CREDIT CERTIFICATE. I THINK THIS IS -- YOU KNOW RESPONSIVE TO CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN THIS COMMITTEE -- EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT THE FUNDING FORMULA COULD GENERATE -- COULD. HAVE INCENTIVES THAT WOULD -- EXPECTED STREAKS TO GENERATE AS MANY CREDENTIALS AS POSSIBLE. WITH REGARD TO WE YOU KNOW I THINK CAN KERR WITH THE INTEREST THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS WITH REGARD -- TO THE DEFINITION OF A SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY WE THINK THAT THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION THAT ACCOMPLISHES THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS BUT IS PREFERABLE WITH REGARD TO INCENTIVES. ACCOUNTING STUDENTS -- COUNTING STE -- THE OUTCOME IN ANY DISTRICT WHERE STUDENTS HAVE ATTAINED A MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS WE SUGGEST TWELVE UNITS BE THAT THRESHOLD -- IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE TRANSFER OUTCOME AND THEN THERE'S AN EXISTING MEASURE IN THE FUNDING FORMULA WITH REGARD TO COMPLETION OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION UNITS. WE CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND -- THAT THAT OUT CAN BE. ACCOUNTED ONLY IF THE STUDENT HAS ATTAINED THOSE IN A SIMILAR PROGRAM AREA A SIMILAR DISCIPLINE SO THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGING THOSE PATHWAYS TOWARDS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION OUT COMES. UP WE HAVE A SET OF TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS WE'VE SHARED WITH THEIR STAFF HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THOSE -- IN FURTHER DETAIL -- JUST MAKE MORE BROADLY WE HER SUPPORT OF AN THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS PROPOSALS -- TO EXPAND -- THE CAL SISTERS RELIEF IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AGAIN THAT -- WILL PROVIDE OUR DISTRICTS WOULD SOME SHORT TERM RELIEF FUND THE COST PRESSURES THAT THEY FACE FOR A RISING PENSION COSTS. AS YOU KNOW OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE THIS YEAR'S TO MAKE PROGRESS ON AFFORDABILITY FOR STUDENTS WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR PROPOSALS AROUND FINANCIAL AID -- WE APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION OF THE GOVERNOR PLACES IN THIS BUDGET IS MAYOR VISION AROUND RAPIDLY HOUSING. YOU KNOW WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE RAPID RE HOUSING PROPOSALS ARE FOR UC AND CSU OUR STUDENTS FACE SIMILAR ISSUES AND SO WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. AND THEN -- LASTLY THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS -- STATE OPERATIONS -- BUDGET -- PROPOSALS WE HAD REQUESTED A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN AND A HALF ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IN THE BUDGET -- WE ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR THE FOR POSITIONS BUT YEAH I THINK WE WOULD JUST. WANT TO POINT OUT BE BOTH SIDES OF THE SYSTEM THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS THE CONTINUED AND RAPID PACE OF CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM. AND SO WOULD LOVE TO HAVE -- FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OUR OFFICES CAPACITY. WITH THAT HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS SHE GALLAGHER -- ON THE SO FOR THE A MINISTRY IS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERING A PERMANENT HOLD HARMLESS LIKE KATE TWELVE HAS WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THE MAYOR VISION OF PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION THAT'S IN CURRENT LAW FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA RIGHT NOW THAT. PROVISION IS OVER THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE FUNDING FORMULA SO. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT HOLDS DISTRICTS HARMLESS AT A LEVEL OF THEIR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TOTAL COMPUTATIONAL REVENUE ADJUSTED FOR COLA FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR. IN THE MAYOR VISION WE ARE PROPOSING TO EXTEND THE HOLD HARMLESS FOR AT THE A FOURTH YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OKAY SAYS AN ADDITIONAL YEAR THEN RIGHT -- I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE. OKAY A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO ON THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR THE CURRENT YEAR IS IS THERE -- SOME SHORTFALL THERE THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF OR ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO TAKE CARE THAT. OF THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THERE IS NO CURRENT YEAR APPORTIONMENT SHORTFALL. OKAY. CONSIDERS TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT. HOUSE OF OUR CURRENT. YOU KNOW OUR FIRST PRINCIPLE PORTION IT'S HOW WE GET MONEY OUT. WE DO. STILL BELIEVE THAT. WE RECOGNIZE THE GOVERNOR -- WOULD ADDRESS PART OF THAT PROBLEM MOST OF THAT PROBLEM WITH REGARD TO ADDITIONAL REVENUES THE GOVERNOR -- PROVIDE SOME GENERAL FUND -- TO TO BACK FILL LOWER PROPERTY TAX ESTIMATES ASSUMES THAT -- PROPERTY TAXES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE WE'VE SEEN THAT IN A HISTORICALLY AND SO -- WE ARE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE REVENUE DIFFERENCES NAIL WE STILL DO YOU SEE A DIFFERENCE IN THE TOTAL COST OF THE FUNDING FORMULA. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- IT WOULD BE IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- TO TO AMENDED THE DEFINITION OF A TRANSFER STUDENT AND SO COMPARED TO WHAT WE'VE TOLD DISTRICTS THEY WOULD RECEIVE -- WE WOULD BE REDUCING APPORTIONMENT STE TO DISTRICTS BASED ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION -- FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BACK FILL BOB WHAT WE BELIEVE IS ABOUT A FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR DIFFERENCE -- FOR EIGHTEEN NINETY OKAY THANK YOU -- WE'RE GONNA HOLD THESE -- THESE ISSUES OPEN THERE'S JUST ONE THING I JUST WANT TO NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT [inaudible] WE HAVE. A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THE FUNDING FORMULA. WHAT WE SHOULD DO GOING FORWARD -- AND WILL HAVE SOME TYPE OF PROPOSAL TO PROBABLY GUESS A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND WHERE NOW WE HAVE RESOLUTION THIS YEAR BUT OF COURSE ONE OF THINGS WE NEED -- TO ADDRESS IS TO FIGURE OUT THEIR PERFORMANCE PERCENTAGE AND WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT TO THAT SO -- THEY'LL ONGOING -- DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT. SO WITH THAT WILL HOLD IS HOLED UP IN THE IT COMMUNITY COLLEGE. MAY REVISED PROPOSALS AND PROCEED NOW WITH. THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. MAY REVISED PROPOSALS GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR -- SO I'M GONNA BEGIN BY GIVING YOU HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW THAN DISCUSS THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION. AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES TOTAL FINANCIAL AID EXPENDITURES OF TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S APPROXIMATELY SHARED 50% BETWEEN GENERAL FUND AT 50% BETWEEN TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES FEDERAL FUNDS. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ONE TIME PROPOSALS AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE LARGEST OF WHICH IS THE CREATION OF A TEACHER SERVICE CREDIT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. OF EIGHTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. AND THAT PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE LOAN FORGIVENESS GRANTS TO TEACHERS MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA AND WHO TEACH IN SPECIFIC SUBJECTS AT CERTAIN SCHOOLS AS IDENTIFIED BY -- TRAILER BILL THAT WAS TRANSMITTED WITH THE MAYOR OF VISION. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THAT THE FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. AND THAT PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON LARGELY SEATING NEW PROGRAMS IN AREAS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION ALONG WITH SOME MONEY TO ENHANCE EXISTING CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS PROGRAMS. BEYOND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO TRANSFERS THE STUDENT LOAN AWARENESS INITIATIVE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. AND THEY WILL WORK IN CONCERT WITH CERTAIN NON PROFITS TO DEVELOP A PLAN. TO SEND THAT MONEY OUT INTO THE FIELD TO HELP STUDENTS AND BORROWERS WITH UNDERSTANDING THEIR STUDENT LOAN OBLIGATIONS. LASTLY THE MAY REVISION ALSO EXTENDS THE TIME LINE FOR PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS TO MEET THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR MAXIMUM CAL GRANT TUITION AWARD. AT NINE THOUSAND EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS BY ONE YEAR SO ALL THE DEADLINES HAVE BEEN SHIFTED BY ONE YEAR FOR THAT. IN ADDITION JUST BROADLY THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO ESTIMATES FOR THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU LA OF THANK YOU THE SECOND WITH LA L.. WISCONSIN THREE OF THE PROPOSALS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE INTRODUCED. I'LL TAKE THEM IN THE ORDER THEY LISTED IN YOUR AGENDA AND PAGE. TWENTY THREE STARTING WITH THE TOP SAVINGS ACCOUNT GRANT PROGRAM. THE RECALL THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAD DECIDED IN MARCH WHILE PROGRAM DETAILS FOR UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IN THE MAYOR REVISION DOES RESEMBLED ADVOCATE COUNTS INITIATIVE WHICH THE LEGISLATURE CREATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO PROVIDE LOCAL GRANTS FOR CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAMS. EVEN THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE COUNTIES FOR EVERY KID COUNTS WE CAN GET COULD BE CONSIDERED PREMATURE TO CREATE A NEW INITIATIVE BEFORE WE HAVE SOME SHORT TERM OUTCOMES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE EXISTING. ONE IF LEGISLATURE DOES WISH TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER WITH YOU MAY ALSO WISH TO CONSIDER STRENGTHENING ITS OPPORTUNITIES TO FIGHT OVERSIGHT OF THE NEW PROGRAM. BY INCLUDING SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND POTENTIALLY BY HAVING A LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE ON THE PROPOSED PROGRAM ADVISORY COUNCIL. AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWENTY THREE YOU'LL SEE A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED STUDENT LOAN AWARENESS INITIATIVE WHICH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES ALSO INTRODUCED. AS NOTED THE MAYOR VISION TRANSFERS THIS INITIATIVE FROM THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. THE ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY PROPOSED FOR THIS INITIATIVE APPEAR TO DUPLICATE SOME CURRENT EFFORTS THAT ARE CONDUCTED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH IS THE PRIMARY LENDER OF STUDENT LOANS. THE SEGMENTS WHICH PACKAGE STATE LANDS OF THE CAMPUS LEVEL. IN A SEVERE OF PRIVATE FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION WHICH CONDUCTS OUTREACH TO STUDENTS CONSIDERING ARE ATTENDING PRIVATE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. IN LIGHT OF THIS DUPLICATION RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. FINALLY TURNING THE PAGE TO SEE A DESCRIPTION OF THE TEACHER SERVICE CREDIT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES LOAN FORGIVENESS GRANTS TO TEACHERS AND SPECIFIED SHORTAGE AREA. AS AN INCENTIVE AVAILABLE FOR A LIMITED TIME WE DON'T THINK THIS PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN A SUSTAINED INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF TEACHERS IN SHORTAGE AREAS. IF DESIGNED WELL HOWEVER IS AN INCENTIVE IT COULD POTENTIALLY ASSIST WITH SHORT TERM TEACHER RECRUITMENT RETENTION NEEDS. WE DON'T ONE CONCERN REGARDING THAT CURRENT DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM. WHICH RELATES THE TIMING OF THE INCENTIVE. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE PRIORITY SCHOOLS WOULD PROMOTE THE LOAN FORGIVENESS GRANTS TO TEACHER CANDIDATE STRING HIRING AND RECRUITING PROCESS. OUR CONCERN HERE IS THE TEACHERS WOULD BE LEARNING ABOUT THIS INCENTIVE IN APPLYING FOR BEING SELECTED FOR IT. AFTER THEY'VE ALREADY MADE A DECISION ABOUT WHICH SUBJECT AREA DOWNTURN POTENTIALLY WHAT TYPE OF SCHOOL TO WORK ACT. WITH THAT IN MIND WE THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LEGISLATURETO IMPROVE THIS PROPOSAL PERHAPS BY REACHING TEACHERS EARLIER IN THE PIPELINE. LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WISH TO DIRECT THE STATE NEED COMMISSION REPORT ON SOME PROGRAM OUTCOMES AS THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION COULD GUIDE FUTURE DECISIONS ABOUT THE USE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO TRUST EACH WORKFORCE ISSUES. THANK YOU CAPITA [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] COMMISSION STAFF. GOOD MORNING CHAIR DAVID O'BRIEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION -- WE JUST ONE ANOTHER WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND FINANCIAL AID AND COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION -- AND OUR STAFF INTERNALLY TO ANALYZE HOW SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BUT THERE ARE SOME VERY PROMISING ITEMS IN THIS BUDGET -- DRESSING TEACHER SHORTAGE WHICH WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THROUGH OUR ASSUMPTION PROGRAM ALONE FOR EDUCATION. THE CARD JING INCENTIVIZING FAMILIES TO OPEN COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WE DISCUSSING THIS SUBCOMMITTEE THROUGH OUR EVERY KID COUNTS PROGRAM. AND PERFORMING OUTREACH IN INCREASING AWARENESS AROUND -- CALLED FINANCING OPTIONS WHICH IS ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES AND HAS BEEN FOR QUITE SOME TIME. SO -- JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE APPRECIATE HIS INVESTMENTS AND OF COURSE WE DO APPRECIATE THE ONGOING OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU THE ADMINISTRATION IS STAKEHOLDERS. ON A SYSTEMIC OVERHAUL OF OUR STATE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM -- BUT IN -- CERTAINLY IN THE INTERIM -- APPRECIATE THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE MAY REVISE AND ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT ON PAGE TWENTY FOUR THE COMMISSION IS STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOANS PROPOSAL WHICH IS INCLUDED HERE IS A AS A LEGISLATIVE BUDGET REQUEST TO CREATE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AID OPPORTUNITIES. FOR A. B. FIVE FORTY AND DREAMER STUDENTS THIS -- SOMETHING LEGISLATION THAT OUR COMMISSION -- COSPONSORED LAST YEAR AND WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE MONTH LEADERSHIP ON THAT ISSUE. DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU JUST A FEW QUESTIONS GOING GOING FORWARD -- ONE AS FAR AS THE CHILD A SAVINGS ACCOUNT -- PROGRAM -- I'M A BIG SUPPORTER THAT WOULD TALK ABOUT FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS AS AS WE NOW -- I THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE TO PUT THIS IN A COMMISSION WEEK WE HAVE SPOKEN TO THE GOVERNOR'S -- TEAM ABOUT THIS AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S PARTY'S PROPOSAL I THINK YOUR YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GOOD ONES WILL LOOK TO INCORPORATE THOSE FROM THE ANALYST NOT GETTING RID OF IT BUT MAKING IT BETTER -- AS FAR AS THE THE THE CAL GRANT AWARDS FOR STUDENTS PARENTS WERE STILL EVALUATING THAT AND THE WHOLE FINANCIAL AID -- PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS FOR REFORM THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT SO I COULD HAVE A PROPOSAL -- FOR NEXT. WEEK I DO WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME. ON THIS -- TEACHER ISSUE THOUGH -- SO THIS IS THIS IS OBVIOUS IS A KIND OF A HYBRID ISSUE WITH OUR K. -- TWELVE WE HAVE WE'VE WE'VE FOCUSED ON THE TEACHER -- SHORTAGE AND YOU KNOW DEALING WITH THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHO ARE AND CREDENTIALED IN CLASSROOMS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND SO IT'S REALLY NOT CAPE. HIGHER AT THINGS MARKET TWELVE THING BUT THIS IS A FINANCIALLY PROGRAM SO I THINK IT THING HERE TO TO REALIZE IS IS TWO THINGS. ONE THERE'S TEACHERS WHO GRADUATE WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. OF OF DEBT. AND HAVE THAT JUST A TOUGH TIME. ENTERING THE WORK FORCE AND YOU KNOW MAKING A GO OF IT THERE IS THIS -- YEAH. I OPENING REPORT I THINK IN ONE OF THE EAST BAY NEWSPAPERS A FEW WEEKS AGO WHAT ALL THESE TEACHERS WHO ARE. FRANKLY LIVING WITH THEIR MOM OR GRANDMA OR TRIPLING OR QUADRUPLING UP IN AN APARTMENT AND JUST. YOU KNOW HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME LEADING NORMAL LIVES WITH FRANKLY A GREAT JOB A GOOD PAYING JOB -- WHEN THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN SOCIETY IT OUT OF A TEACHER? AND SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS AS FAR AS THE FINANCIAL PIECE OF THAT. BUT THE OTHER THING AS FAR AS THE NEED TO GET MORE TEACHERS IN THE WORK FORCE AND FRANKLY WORKING IN. SCHOOLS WHERE WE NEED THE MOST HELP BECAUSE YOU KNOW FRANKLY IF THERE WERE SIX IF THEY'RE A BUNCH OF AN CREDENTIALED TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL OR MY KIDS GO TO SCHOOL. NOW THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE A REVOLT AND THEY'D BE IN THE DISTRICT OFFICES WILL THAT HAPPEN BUT THE T. TO SCHOOLS IN OUR IN A FIVE MILES SOUTH OF HERE LOWER INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IS JUST THAT IT IS WHAT IT IS AND I THINK THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE. DISGRACE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE -- QUALIFIED TEACHERS SO I GUESS THE ISSUE THAT I'M WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IS THAT. THIS SOUNDS LIKE AT A REASONABLE PROPOSAL BUT YOU KNOW IS THIS THE BEST ONE TO ADDRESS THOSE -- TWO THOSE ISSUES -- THAT THEIR DUAL ISSUES THERE -- IMPORTANT ONES I KNOW WE'VE HAD. THESE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS OVER THE YEARS WHICH HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THE WORKFORCE NOT JUST MONEY GETTING IN -- BUT SUPPORT TO KEEP THEM IN THE CLASSROOM -- AND AND THAT IS IS AN ISSUE AND I THINK WE TAKE A LOOK AT AND THEN. FOR THE OVERALL FINANCIAL AID IS WE'VE HAD AS YOU MENTIONED THE LOAN FORGIVENESS THE APPLE WHICH I THINK IS AN INTERESTING -- NOTION TO BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PERFORM YOU HAVE TO YOU CAN'T JUST GET THE MONEY. ON THE LOAN FOR FORGIVENESS AND GO AWAY YOU GET IT EVERY YEAR YOU STICK AROUND. A CLASSROOM SO. I THINK THIS. ON THE RIGHT -- THE POINT HERE BILLION TO EVALUATE YOU KNOW THAT LOGISTICS OF THIS. AND WHAT MAKES -- WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE SO WILL CERTAINLY? TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IN THE COMING WEEKS AND WITH THAT. NOBODY HERE TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT ME SO -- I'M GOOD SIR GONNA HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND PROCEED NOW WITH PUBLIC COMMENT. I SEE THIS BAKER IS ALREADY LINE DEATHS IS A PRO.
