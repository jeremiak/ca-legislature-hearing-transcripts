MR ROSS THANK YOU THANK YOU SURE WELL DONALD- FOR THOSE KIND WORDS HELLO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR COLLABORATION AND MAKING THIS HEARING- COME TO FRUITION. CERTAINLY IT'S A TOPIC THAT WARRANTS DISCUSSION- AND SIT IN THE LEGISLATURE WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IN ENGAGING IN THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS- THE CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EXAMPLES OF WHY- THIS TYPE OF- EDUCATION ALL- AWARENESS OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING HERE WITH THE HEARING. NEEDS TO BE DONE AND JUST RECENTLY THERE WAS A SITUATION THAT THAT HAPPENED IN- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA'S DISTRICT THAT I THINK I'M THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I COULD- GO AHEAD AND ALLOWS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. TO COMMENT ON THAT SITUATION. THANK YOU ARE YOUR RAMOS AND J. OF. I DO WANNA. THE STORY OF THE RECENT INCIDENT. THAT OCCURRED IN MY DISTRICT. A RIVERSIDE THE LAST WEEK LAST WEEK THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL. TO WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY. LAST WEEK AT ONE OF OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS A MATHEMATICS TEACHER WAS TEACHING A LESSON. WHERE SHE INCLUDED ON THE MONIC DEVICE. THE TEACHER BEGAN TO IMITATE NATIVE AMERICANS TO THE POINT THAT A STUDENT THE CLASS. WHO FELT UNCOMFORTABLE BEGAN RECORDING THE INCIDENT. AT THE TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ADVANTAGES AND HI ALL CONDEMN THE TEACHER'S BEHAVIOR WHICH WAS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE AND OFFENSIVE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS MORNING HOWEVER THAT THIS ISN'T THIS IS AND WAS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS PARTICULAR TEACHER DEMONSTRATED THE SAME BEHAVIOR. PICTURES OF THE YEAR IN THE YEARBOOK OF HER- WITH HEADRESTS- FROM TEN YEARS EARLIER. NOR WAS THIS THE FIRST TIME IN ANY CLASSROOM WERE NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED IN SUCH A TRITE INACCURATE AND HARMFUL WAY. THIS IS BENNETT ONGOING FAILURE ACROSS THE AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM FOR GENERATIONS AND CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE. I OFTENTIMES STUDENTS ONLY EXPERIENCE OR INTERACTION WITH INDIGENOUS CULTURE IN THE CLASSROOM HAS BEEN A CARTOONISH SCHOOL MASCOT. AND AN ACCURATE OR EUROCENTRIC ACCOUNT OF HISTORY THAT'S GOOD. NOT ONLY HAS THIS PREVENTED STUDENTS FROM HAVING A RICHER MORE ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR COMPLEX HISTORY. BUT ALSO THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY HARMFUL FOR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CONDUCTED STUDIES TO EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND REPRESENTATION IN THE CLASS IN THE CLASSROOM. FOLLOWING THIS INVESTIGATION THE ADMINISTRATION THE ADMINISTRATION DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR NATIVE YOUTHS AND THEIR EDUCATION. AMONG THE PROBLEMS INCLUDED WE'RE UNDER ACHIEVEMENT LOW RETENTION LIMITED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND LACK OF COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS. THOSE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE SEVEN YEARS AGO BUT LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS IN THE SUCCEEDING TIME IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION OF NATIVE CULTURE WHERE STUDENTS SUPPORT. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I HAVE ADVOCATED SO LONG FOR ETHNIC STUDIES IS BECAUSE OF THE BENEFIT IT BRINGS TO STUDENTS. STUDIES THIS YEAR PROVED THAT THE ACCURATE AND POSITIVE REPRESENTATION OF CULTURES IMPROVES ACHIEVEMENT FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. NOW THAT AB ONE OH ONE HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR I AM FULLY COMMITTED THAT WE DO EVERYTHING AS A STATE AND AS THE LEGISLATURE. TO ENSURE THAT INCIDENTS INCIDENTS LIKE THE ONE LAST WEEK IN RIVERSIDE DO NOT HAPPEN AGAIN WE DO WE MUST DO BETTER. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS HEARING AND SEEING HOW WE ADVANCE AND IMPROVE EDUCATION. FOR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS AND ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- MEDINA FOR- FOR ALLOWING US TO CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FURTHER DISCUSS NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA INDIAN CULTURE- IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT ALL NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE AND THE TEACHINGS THAT ARE GOING ON- CERTAINLY THESE INCIDENTS pOR DISRESPECT TOWARDS. THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE AND ALL NATIVE AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE NATION WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE HOME. TO MORE- NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION IN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION BUT YET WORKING- TO ENSURE THAT OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER LIKE WE ARE TODAY WITH THIS JOINT HEARING AND BRINGING FORWARD. THOSE AREAS ARE STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED- WE LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING AND THEN WITH THE HISTORY OF THE STATE AND WITH THE WHOLE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM NOT JUST TODAY BUT WHAT HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ULTIMATELY FROM THE EARLY EXPLORATIONS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE KNOW TODAY AND WHAT WE CALL CALIFORNIA TODAY AND THE TREATMENT TOWARDS CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE THROUGH THAT WHOLE- EXPLORATION THE COLONIZATION UP TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. WHICH IS STILL HAPPENING IN THE CLASSROOMS AS FAR AS BLATANT DISRESPECT TOWARDS THE CULTURE THAT WAS FIRST YEAR. SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK AT THE- THOSE AREAS AND THE TREATMENT TOWARDS CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE AS A HISTORY. THAT IS STILL LACKING OF A TRUE PORTRAYAL OF THE VOICE OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ITSELF. LOOKING AT A TROOPER TRAIL WITHIN THE THIRD AND FOURTH GRADE OF LEARNING ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN AREAS AS WELL AS THE HISTORY THE HISTORY THAT CONTINUES TO BE TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS THAT WE NOW ARE ABLE TO BRING BEFORE FRONT TALK ABOUT. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EIGHTH GRADE IN THE AREAS THAT HAVE HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES AND HOW THE UNITED STATES AND SOME OF THOSE POLICIES LED TO REIMBURSEMENT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR MALICIOUS BEING FORMED AND READING AREAS OF INDIAN PEOPLE IN OUR OWN AREA IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ULTIMATELY IN BED IN THE ELEVENTH GRADE IN THE GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S AN INCLUSION OF THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS I'M INCLUDED IN TE FEDERAL THE STATE AT THE LOCAL. AND TRIBAL. THESE ARE AREAS THAT ARE STILL- NEEDING TO HAVE THAT THE VOICE OF THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE- DOES THESE ARE AREAS ARE GOING TO HEAR TESTIMONY ON TODAY- DURING OUR PRESENTERS IN THE PANEL. IN THE THANK YOU AGAIN- CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL FOR- COMING TOGETHER CONVENING THIS JOINT HEARING THIS IS SO IMPORTANT AND HISTORIC AND I WANT TO- ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THROUGH YOUR CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE THIS IS HISTORIC. TO BRING THESE ISSUES TO LIGHT IN THE FOREFRONT OF MOVING FORWARD IN HOPES OF CONTINUING TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE THAT VOICE AND SUCCEED IN EDUCATION SUMMIT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. TERMINAL DAHLE FOR THAT. THANK GOD. THANK YOU A- THE GERMAN RAMOS AND MEDINA IS FOR YOUR MEDINA FOR YOUR COMMENTS- SO THAT WHEN WE MOVE INTO OUR FIRST PANEL- SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND IS DELAYED I'VE BEEN TOLD SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO START WITH HIM WHAT WE ARE GOING TO START WITH- CHAIRMAN KENNETH KAHN THE TRIBAL CHAIRMAN OF THE SANTA YNEZ BAND OF CHUMASH INDIANS WHO IS JOINING US FIVE WEBEX- CHAIRMAN CON. YOU MAY RECEIVE ALREADY. COOL STRAW PARTY NINE HELLO AND GOOD MORNING I'M CATCON ON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE'S BAND OF CHUMASH INDIANS. I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL- CHAIRMAN ROLLO'S IN MEMBER MEDINA FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR CALIFORNIA AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULA OUR TRIBE SPONSORED AB FIVE FORTY FOUR TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE AND TEACHING CREDENTIAL- WE WORK HARD TO GET THE SUPPORT OF BOTH THE CALIFORNIA- TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION FOR A BI POP FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. I TRIED ALSO SPONSORED AB ONE SIXTY THREE TO EXTEND THE NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE TEACHING CREDENTIAL- TO ALSO INCREASE INCLUDE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE TEACHING CREDENTIAL IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. OUR CLUB ALONE HAS- THREE CREDENTIAL NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE TEACHERS I WHAT WE NEED NEXT IS WAS A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM TO COMPLETE THE TEACHING OF NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE SO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE SPONSORED AB SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT WITH AN ASSEMBLY WOMAN- AND NOW STATE SENATOR MONIQUE LIMON. TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA NATIVE CURRICULUM ADOPTING THE INSTRUCTIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE WITH CONSIDERATION BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. REGRETTABLY AB SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT WAS NEVER FUNDED AND THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS STATEWIDE ON A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM UNTIL HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR. AND THIS YEAR THE AB ONE SIXTY SEVEN BUDGET TRAILER BILL- BUDGET OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION FOUR FOUR MODEL CURRICULUM FOR THREE SOUTH EAST ASIAN GROUPS. AND NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM. IT'S UNCLEAR HOW AB ONE SIXTY SEVEN PLANNING WILL BE ALLOCATED BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT- CALIFORNIA TRIBES WILL GIVE ME. FOR THAT FUNDING- ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON AS EACH TRIBE IS DEVOTED TO EDUCATING THEIR- TRIBAL CHILDREN ARE TRIED THAT SETTING IS BANDED TO MATCH HAS. A DEDICATED EDUCATION DEPARTMENT WITH DEDICATED IN PERSON AS SOON TUTORS FOR TEACHING ABROAD AS A RESULT WE'RE PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED A 100% HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE IN OUR SERVICE AREA. EACH OF THESE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THE TRIBE HAS PLEDGED TO FULLY. FUND UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE DEGREES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT OUR TRIBAL STUDENTS HAVE EARNED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN BACHELOR DEGREES. GALLUP POLL FOUR FORTY SIX MASTER'S DEGREES AND EIGHTY PHD OR VERY VERY PROUD OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS SO WE WANT TO PLEDGE THE SUPPORT OF THE CHUMASH BIRD BILLS BEING DISCUSSED TODAY. WE APPRECIATE THE ALL THE WORK THAT THIS ELEMENT RAMOS HAS BEEN DOING TO SUPPORT- ARE NATIVE AMERICAN EFFORTS WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE THAT THE SELLER ALMOST WILL SUCCEED- WERE AB SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT- MAY HAVE FALLEN SHORT- DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING. THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE TESTIMONY ON THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS. CALIFORNIA EDUCATION AND IN GENERAL- AND NATIVE AMERICAN CRITICAL SPECIFICALLY. PAKI NICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I'M IS SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN READY TO TESTIFY DO WE KNOW. WE'RE TOLD NOT YET SO WHY DON'T WE MOVE ON AND MOVE MAYBE IF WE HAVE A- COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE CHAIRMAN I PROBABLY HAVE MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A QUESTION- YOU NEED CURRICULUM. AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER THAT'S MY BACKGROUND AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. BOB CERTAINLY UNIT CURRICULUM BUT YOU ALSO NEED RESOURCES. SO AS WE GO FORWARD- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS A CLASSROOM TEACHER GONNA NEED THEY WALK ANOTHER CLASSROOM IN THE MORNING. OR THE AFTERNOON PRIOR- IT WHEN DID TO THE DAY THEY'RE GOING TO DELIVER THE LASSEN AND THEY'RE PLANNING THEIR LOSS AND WHAT THEY REALLY NEED FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ARE OUR RESOURCES RIGHT- BECAUSE OF THEY'VE- GOT A REPEAT WHAT THEY HEARD IN THIRD GRADE LIKE. IS PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENED. IN ABOUT GLEE WAS RIVERSIDE OR SAMBAR DINO THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING. HEY SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I JUST WANT TO INJECT INTO THIS CONVERSATION THE IMPORTANCE OF. ENSURING THAT TEACHERS HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES. AND BREAD THAT'S THEY CAN GO TO A WEBSITE WHATEVER IT IS- NOT A BOOK REALLY. BUT THINGS THAT ENGAGE KIDS RIGHT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT TYPES OF- RESOURCES THAT ENGAGE KIDS THAT THEY CAN. THEY CAN THE KIDS CAN ACCESS. EITHER THROUGH THEIR- THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR CHROMEBOOK WHEN THEY'RE IN CLASS OR OR OR TEACHER CAN. SHOW TO THE CLASS OR HAND OUT TO THE CLASS PRINT OFF EXTENDER THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IS UP TO DATE SHOULD NOTICE I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN BACK IN THE CLASS WAS NOT MUCH PRUNING GOING ON RIGHT NOW. WELL A LOT OF CHROMEBOOKS OUT THERE SO THERE'S- A BIT RUNNING AT THE SCHOOL'S BEEN DOES DROP BY 80% PLUS. BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S REALLY ON A CHROMEBOOK NOMINAL AND MANY SCHOOLS NOT ALL BUT MANY SCHOOLS. BUT AGAIN THOSE RESOURCES NEED TO BE AMPLY AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS SO THAT THEY CAN TEACH. THIS CONTENT. IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. AND THAT'S JUST FROM SOMEONE WHO'S- YOU KNOW GONE EITHER HAD TO LOOK FOR DIFFERENT RESOURCES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF LESSONS. AND THERE MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE ONE GOOD PLACE TO GO AND IF WE GET ESTABLISH ONE GOOD PLACE TO GO. I THINK THAT'S OUR GOAL HERE- THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK. MOST CLASSROOM TEACHERS PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS- CHAIRMAN DONAL- CHEN CON I DON'T KNOW IF YOU A LOSE SOME OTHER TEACHING MATERIALS THAT- THE CHUMASH INDIAN AS PEOPLE HAVE CREATED- WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL AREA WITHIN YOUR OWN TRY BUT ALSO SHARING THOSE RESOURCES WITH THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ABSOLUTELY I MEAN. YOU KNOW NOT ONLY IS THE FUNDING NEEDED BUT- OUR OUR TRANSPACIFIC WE YOU KNOW OUR OUR DREAM IS THAT A PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT- YOU KNOW WOULD BE WORKING WITH CULTURAL DEPARTMENTS- WITH OUR LANGUAGE DEPARTMENTS AND WITH OUR MUSEUMS- YOU KNOW THE TEN IT'S BEEN A TWO MATCH WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE ABOVE. AND I KNOW THAT OTHER TRIBES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AND YOU KNOW IDEALLY- WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THOSE DISTRICT. THIS WAY WE CAN REALLY TEACH OUR KIDS ABOUT THAT THE ABORIGINAL TERRITORIES THAT THEY- THEY'RE LEARNING WITHIN. THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR THAT AND SURE AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED- IS THERE'S A 100% GRADUATION RATE DO YOU A TEST THAT TOO- THE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY AND THE EDUCATION THAT COMPONENT THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT THAT INCREASES THAT. ATTAINMENT WELL YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY HAVE A HANDS ON- LEARNING MODEL I WOULD LEARNING CENTER HERE ON THE RESERVATION BUT WE ALSO REACH OUT TO OUR STUDENTS NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE- WITHIN THE STATE OR WITHIN THE NATION AND SO- YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THE LANGUAGE LEARN ABOUT THEIR CULTURE IT'S JUST AN ADDITIONAL- LEARNING OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM- BUT THAT EXTRA SUPPORT REALLY HELPS THEM ONCE A WEEK YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ALWAYS A 100% ON ANNUAL BASIS BUT THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PROUD TO REPORT THAT THAT THAT WAS OUR CURRENT. REPORT SELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS TO MR MEDINA YEP MAYBE JUST A COMMENT- FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT CHAIR RAMOS I THINK THE RECENT STUDY AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY OF FOUR YEARS AGO AND AGAIN THIS YEAR- SHOWS EXACTLY THAT THE DATE THE DATA- PROVES AND SUBSTANTIATES A WHAT YOU JUST SAID THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE GROUNDED. IN THEIR OWN CULTURE- THEY HAVE A SENSEOF WHO THEY ARE AND DO MUCH MORE- ARE ARE MUCH. APPLIED YOUR EFFORTS OUT IN THE SANTA BARBARA VENTURA COUNTY. THANK YOU MR MEDINA ALL ALL HAND OVER THE GAVEL TO MISTER RAMOS IS GOING TO INTRODUCE OUR SECOND PANEL ON THE SUPERINTENDENT- IS AVAILABLE WE WILL HAVE HIM- SHARE HIS THOUGHTS.

WE WILL ALSO HEAR AND WE'RE ALSO FORTUNATE TO HEAR AND HAVE WITH US A REPRESENTATIVE- FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVE SHARON TO ME BECAUSE SANTOS CHAIR OF THE WASHINGTON STATE HOUSE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND WE ALSO ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE WITH US THE DISTINGUISHED FORMER SENATOR JOHN MCCOY. HE IS A REGISTERED MEMBER OF THE TULALIP TRIBE IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON AND THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THE LEGISLATION THAT MOVED FORWARD TODAY TO.

WILL NOT ALLOW THE GOOD MORNING TERMINAL CHAIRMAN DRAMAS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. NO MERRY LEVI I AM VERY LEAVE I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE- THE ANCESTRAL LANDS OF THE MOONWALK AND THE NAY SUNNY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHO HAVE WALKED THESE LANDS BEFORE US. I SPEAK TO YOU HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION CTA. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AN EDUCATOR'S VOICE AT TODAY'S HEARING ON CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM AND STUDENT SUCCESS. IT IS MY HONOR TO SERVE AS THE CHAIR OF CTAS AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE CAUCUS. AND AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CTA POLICY MAKING STEP THE STATE COUNCIL OF EDUCATION A GOVERNING BODY OF EIGHT HUNDRED ELECTED CLASSROOM TEACHERS. CTA'S ORGANIZATIONAL POLICY. STRONGLY SUPPORTS TEACHING STUDENTS ABOUT ANCESTRAL LEGACIES AND THE CULTURE OF OUR CALIFORNIAN NATIVE PEOPLE. WE FEEL THAT IT IS IN THE CENTRAL- IN THE STRUGGLE OF RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY. CTA SUPPORTS PROMOTING GENUINE RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY BY PROVIDING STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A WELL ROUNDED EDUCATION THAT INCLUDES NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE SHOWN THIS IN SUPPORT OF MANY ASSEMBLY BILLS I WAS- CHAIRMAN KHAN HAS SAID WE HAVE A SUPPORTED ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WAS A LOW MOAN- MODEL CURRICULUM FOR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES BUT HAD NO FUNDING TO IT. AND AB ONE SIXTY THREE THAT ALLOWED- THAT WAS IN TEACHING CREDENTIALS FOR ELDERS TO TEACH NATIVE CULTURE AND LANGUAGE. AND OF COURSE THE NINE AB NINE FORTY FIVE RAMOS pGUARANTEED OR HELPED IN OUR NATIVE STUDENTS WEAR THEIR REGALIA AT GRADUATION. AND IN THE FIGHT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES INCLUDING NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM. THIS ENHANCES STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF CULTURAL DIVERSE EDUCATION. HOWEVER EVEN THOUGH WE GIVE OUR SUPPORT AND WE CONTINUE TO FIND WE CONTINUE TO FIND EDUCATORS. NEEDING TO HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION A CURRICULUM TO PRESENT TO THEIR STUDENTS. THESE ARE ALL A SMALL STEP IN ACHIEVING A VERY LARGER PICTURE. TEACHERS FACE MANY CHALLENGES FACED A FINDING- ADEQUATE CURRICULAR RESOURCES ON THIS ISSUE. FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS WE TEACH ABOUT OUR LOCAL NATIVE COMMUNITIES AND I AM FORTUNATE TO HAVE LOCAL CONNECTIONS TO ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT I THAT DON'T ROMANTICIZE HISTORY M. PRESENTS. AND THE PRESENCE OF NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT I SHARE WITH EVERYONE I CAN IN THE SPACES I OCCUPY. CONNECTIONS TO CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SACRAMENTO PROVIDES LESSONS ON THE WINDOW MAINT WOULDN'T TWO TRIBES ON SALMON- CAL STATE SAMBAR ANY DINO UNIVERSITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL SAN MANUEL BAND OF INDIANS PROVIDE FIELD TRIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR MY STUDENTS TO LEARN IN A HANDS ON MANNER ABOUT THE SERRANO PEOPLE. AND MY OWN FATHER IN LAW ROBERT LEVI PROVIDES OFF THEN TAKE COOLEY OF BIRD SONGS THREE CDC RECORDED BEFORE HIS PASSING. THESE CURRICULAR RESOURCES DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR NATIVE THE IMMINENT CALIFORNIA NATIVE TRIBES SHOULD BE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED AND FUNDED FOR ALL TEACHERS TO HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THEM. RESEARCH SHOWS OFFERING OF FINTECH ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM IN IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT FOR A CULTURALLY DIVERSE AT EDUCATION ENHANCING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. AND IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. STUDENTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AUTHENTIC CURRICULUM THEY ARE MORE ENGAGED IN LEARNING AND LEARN UNDERSTANDING NATIVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA MINISTRY TO PROCESS FOR REVIEWING ALL ACADEMIC CONTENT STANDARDS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUSIVENESS OF NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM THROUGH OUT KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE. TIM STEELE AT BIG PINE HIGH TEACHES NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIS STUDENT OF THE PAIUTE AND SHOSHONE DESCENT WANT TO LEARN THEIR HISTORY WHICH INCLUDES THE ALICE PIPER AND BIG PINE COURT CASE THAT ALLOWED NATIVE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA TO ATTEND CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. TODAY THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CALIFORNIAN NATIVE AMERICANS INTO THE TEACHING PROFESSION. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MORE THE MORE OUR STANDARDS REFLECT APPROPRIATE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM THE MORT STAR STUDENTS BECOME ENGAGED IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. AND THEREFORE WOULD BE WANT TO TEACH THE CURRICULUM THAT TELLS THEIR ACCURATE HISTORY AND CULTURE OF WHO THEY ARE. IN CLOSING I AM ONE OF HUNDREDS OF DEDICATED TEACHERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS APPROPRIATE AND ACCURATE ACCESS TO NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM. WITH LIMITED CURRICULAR RESOURCES CALIFORNIA TODAY HAS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION TO CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT OF COLLABORATION AND FUNDING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WITHIN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS WILL BENEFIT ALL STUDENTS. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE A SCHOOLING.

BOTH YOU- SUPERINTENDENT AND TO- MERRY LEVI. IF YOU COULD. THE SUPERINTENDENT. THANK YOU THROUGH THE CHAIRS- AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA GOOD MORNING ONE OF THE S.

LITTLE CHILD WHO IS ENTERING KINDERGARTEN AND UGH THIS STUDY THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED IN WAS ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION AND SO THE TASK IN FRONT OF HER WAS TO NAME THIS ANIMAL. SO THE CHILD THOUGHT ABOUT IT. ONLY FOR A MOMENT AND QUICKLY RESPONDED TO HER TEACHER. AND NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND WHAT SHE SAID I'M GOING TO JUST PULL THIS UP BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP- AND HOW TO SAID. WHAT SHE SAID WAS THIS. COOPER CALLING EACH. AND THE TEACHER LOOK AT THIS CHILD IN SAID ALL RIGHT DEAR THAT'S NOT CORRECT. THAT'S WHY DON'T YOU TRY AGAIN. NEXT SLIDE. SO THE TRUCK WAS A LITTLE PUZZLED BECAUSE SHE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE ANIMAL. SO SHE SAID ALL DO YOU MEAN THE OR PROC. THE TEACHER LOOKED AT THE CHILD AGAIN SADLY AND SHOOK HER HEAD AND SAID I'M SORRY DEAR. WE TRY ONE MORE TIME I'M SURE THAT YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT THE NAME OF THIS ANALYSTS. NEXT SLIDE. NOW THE CHILD WAS VERY VERY PUZZLED. AND SHE TOOK A LONG TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS. AND FINALLY SHE SAID. DO YOU MEAN KILLER WHALES. AT WHICH POINT THE TEACHER SMILED AND PRAISE THE CHILD PROFUSELY ABOUT GETTING THE RIGHT ANSWER. THAT RAISES THE QUESTION NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. HOW IS SUCCESS MEASURED. THIS CHILD NEW THREE DIFFERENT WAYS BY WHICH TO IDENTIFY AND IDENTIFY THE ANIMAL. THAT SHE WAS ASKED TO NAME AND YET THE TEACHER ONLY RECOGNIZED ONE. GET THAT RAISES THE FURTHER QUESTION NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IT WHO DECIDES WHAT IS RIGHT. WHO GETS TO DECIDE. THE OLD START BACK UP ONE OR PLEASE. THERE YOU GO. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. I LEARNED FROM SENATOR JOHN MCCOY. BECAUSE THE CHILD INVOLVED WITH HIS GRAN TRIED. THE WHALE THE KILLER WHALE. THE ORCA. AND THE NATIVE BELOVED NAME. OUR IS AN ANIMAL THAT IS SACRED. TO THE TULALIP TRIBE TO WHICH SENATOR MCCORD BELONGS AND TO WHICH THERE FOR HIS CHILD GRANDCHILD BELONGS. THIS COMMITTEE IS WHY THIS MEETING IS SO IMPORTANT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IT IS ABOUT RESPECT. I'VE SHARED WITH YOU ON THIS SLIDE. OF FAVORITE QUOTE OF MINE BY AN INDIGENOUS A WOMAN FROM AUSTRALIA BUT I THINK IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO ME AS A NON NATIVE PERSON. BUT TO ALL OF US. BECAUSE OUR LIBERATION IS BOUND UP WITH ONE ANOTHER. THE MORE THAT WE CAN LEARN ABOUT OUR NEIGHBORS. OUR CHILDREN. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I SHARE WITH YOU AN OVERVIEW TIMELINE OF WASHINGTON AT THE END OF EDUCATION POLICY OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. ARE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT MORE DEEPLY AT YOUR LEISURE BUT THERE ARE THREE POINTS THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AS IMPORTANT PRECEDENTS. TO HOWL WASHINGTON STATE WAS ABLE TO ENGAGE IN TRAVEL HISTORY AND CULTURE LEGISLATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST. BEGINNING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND THEN REMOVED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SEVERAL FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN WASHINGTON STATE. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SOVEREIGNTY WHICH IS INHERENT IN INDEPENDENT FOR EACH OF THE TRUCKS. AND THAT WE AS CO GOVERNMENTS HAD MUTUAL INTERESTS IN A VARIETY OF ISSUES INCLUDING THE EDUCATION OF INDIAN STUDENTS. SECONDLY I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT WITHOUT THE ELECTION OF NATIVE LEGISLATE WARS WHO CHAMPIONED THE EDUCATION OF NOT JUST THEIR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. WAS ESSENTIAL PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR MCCORD. PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR CLAUDIA KAUFMAN AND I CURRENTLY SERVE WITH REPRESENTATIVE DEBORAH LOOK KIND OF. ALL ARE IMPORTANT TWO HELPING KEEP OUR LEGISLATURE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE UP PROVISIONS. AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CENTENNIAL ACCORD AND MILLENNIAL AGREEMENT AND THEN FINALLY. WE HAD MULTIPLE EFFORTS THAT FOCUSED ON. WHAT ADDITIONALLY WE CALLED THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR DIFFERENT RACIAL AND ETHNIC SUBGROUPS BUT EVENTUALLY CAME TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY GAP WHERE AS THE CHAIRMAN INDICATED WE HAVE OVER A LACK OF RESOURCES THAT ARE ACTUALLY DEDICATED TO NARROWING AND EVENTUALLY ELIMINATING THE DIFFERENTIAL PERFORMANCE UP ON ACADEMIC MEASURES AND TESTS FOR DIFFERENT STUDENTS. I WILL DISCUSS THOSE ELEMENTS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THAT- IN THE REMAINING PORTION OF THIS SLIDESHOW. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE SUBJECT OF YOUR INTEREST AS I UNDERSTAND IS THIS BILL. SUBSTITUTE HOUSE BILL FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE WHICH WAS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE CREATING THE TRAVEL HISTORY AND CULTURE OF. POLICY FOR THE STATE OF WASHINGTON AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE HIGHLIGHTED A LOT STATEMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT THE LACK OF ACCURATE AND COMPLETE CURRICULUM MAY CONTRIBUTE. TO THE PERSISTENT% ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN INDIAN AND OTHER STUDENTS WAS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS BILL. HOWEVER AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A HANDOUT FOR YOU OF THE FULL BILL- ED. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT NOT ONLY WAS THEIR FOCUS ON NATIVE STUDENTS BUT IMPLICITLY RECOGNIZING THAT ALL STUDENTS ESPECIALLY IN THE OUR INCREASINGLY INTERCONNECTED INTERNATIONAL WORLD. THAT ALL STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM INCREASED KNOWLEDGE. ABOUT NATIVE HISTORY CULTURE AND LANGUAGE. THE HEALTH EDUCATION COMMITTEE ON WASHINGTON HAD MULTIPLE AFTER OPPORTUNITIES TO VISIT SCHOOLS THAT ACTUALLY ARE PRACTICED OUR TRAVEL HISTORY AND CULTURE WHICH LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS LEGISLATION. WHERE NATIVE FOCUSED CURRICULUM. IMPROVED ACADEMIC MEASURES OF SUCCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS. FURTHER WE FOUND THAT THE PRACTICE BECAUSE OF THE FOCUS ON SOVEREIGNTY IMPROVE COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND THE PLACES WHERE THE SCHOOLS ARE EXISTED AS LOCAL SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS ADMINISTRATORS AND ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD DIRECTORS LEARN HOW TO ENGAGE IN AUTHENTIC AND MEANINGFUL GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND COORDINATING TOGETHER A PROGRAM OF EDUCATION FOR THEIR STUDENTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT BOTH AND THIS BILL FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE AS WELL AS IN THE PRACTICE BEFORE. THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS THAT HELPED DEVELOP THE CURRICULA. WAS LOCALLY DRIVEN AND WE HAVE NOT AS MANY AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT WE HAVE TWENTY NINE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND PROBABLY TEN OR DOZEN NON RECOGNIZED TRIBES EACH UP WITH ITS OWN CULTURE. ITS OWN HISTORY AND AGAIN ON FOREVER THE RECOGNIZED TRIBES THE ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY WHICH IS INHERENT AND INDEPENDENT AND LEARNING TO WORK TOGETHER WAS AN IMPORTANT LESSON NOT ONLY FOR THE ADULTS IN THE SYSTEM. BUT ALSO FOR MODELING FOR THE STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM. HOUSE BILL FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE THEN ALLOWED FOR THE STATE I BEG YOUR PARDON I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY MOUTH- AT ALLOWED FOR THE STATE. TO ENGAGE IN DEVELOPING THROUGH OUR OFFICE OF NATIVE EDUCATION IN THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE ON DEVELOPING A STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK BECAUSE WHILE THESE EXAMPLES OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS LEADING TO GOOD LOCAL MADE OF HISTORY AND CULTURE CURRICULUM. WERE I SHINING SPOTS THE WORD JUST THAT JUST SPOTS AND WE WANTED TO SEE THIS. OUR EXPANDED ALL ACROSS THE STATE SO THE FRAMEWORK PROVIDED BY SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. HAS A BASIC FRAMEWORK WHICH THEN LOCAL DISTRICTS CAN ADAPT TO IN IN COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL TRIBES. OUGHT TO MEET THEN THE LOCAL CONDITIONS THE LOCAL HISTORY THE LOCAL CULTURE BECAUSE LIKE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A COASTAL PORTION OF OUR STATE BUT WE HAVE AN INTERIOR PORTION OF OUR STATE AND THE CULTURES ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT. AT THE SAME TIME I MENTIONED THAT- WE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE WE HAD OTHER EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF LOS LASH OPPORTUNITY GAPS FOR MULTIPLE RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. FOR THE NATURE OF OUR COMMUNITY- WE HAD COMMISSIONED. A REPORT. TO ASK THE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN THE STUDENTS OF NATIVE AMERICAN AMERICAN INDIAN NATIVE ALASKAN HERITAGE. WHAT THEY WANTED FROM SCHOOL WHAT THEY EXPECTED OF THEIR SUDENTS AND THAT DOCUMENT THREE HUNDRED PAGE DOCUMENT OF WAS ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ENTITLED FROM WHERE THE SUN RISES. THAT HELPS CREATE THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY GAP OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE LEADING TO POLICIES THAT INCLUDED DISAGGREGATED DATA. ULTRA COMPETENCY STANDARDS AND TRAINING INCREASING THE DIVERSITY OF OUR ETHNIC TEACHERS. REFORMING DISCIPLINE AND FACILITATING FAMILY AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OR ENGAGEMENT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SADLY OUR EFFORTS WERE STILL SPORADIC BECAUSE SHE IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE- BILL WAS TRYING TO RESPECT LOCAL CONTROL OF OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SO THE WORD WAS TO ENCOURAGE. LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TEN YEARS LATER AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE THE LEGISLATURE FELLOW THAT MERELY ENCOURAGING EDUCATION REGARDING WASHINGTON'S TRIBAL HISTORY AND CULTURE AND GOVERNMENT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT AND THEREFORE THE LEGISLATURE DECLARED ITS INTENT THAT SUCH EDUCATION BE MANDATORY IN WASHINGTON COMMON SCHOOLS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TWO THINGS OCCURRED. IN THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL ONE BY THEN WE HAD THE STI CURRICULUM DEVELOPED AND SHARED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT TO. I FOR INSIDER POLITICS IN WASHINGTON I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PRIME SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. I IS A IS THE REPUBLIC REPUBLICAN CHAIR OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME. WELL SENATOR MCCOY OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT THE POINT IS WE RECOGNIZED IN THE WASHINGTON STATE LEGISLATURE THAT THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS IS A BI PARTISAN MANNER. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I DO WANT TO STAND FOR YOUR QUESTION FOR THE LAST TWO SLIDES ARE REALLY- THIS ONE TALKS ABOUT OTHER EDUCATION NATIVE EDUCATION INITIATIVES THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THIS TIME THAT YOU MIGHT FIND OF INTEREST UP AGAIN SENATOR MCCOY HELPED SHEPHERD THE STATE TRIBAL EDUCATION COMPAQ SCHOOLS WHEREBY. ARE RELYING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS THE STATE OF WASHINGTON AND A TRIED CAN ENTER INTO A CONTRACT AGREEMENT WHERE THE TRIED PROVIDES THE BASIC EDUCATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATE'S UP REQUIREMENTS AND MANDATES AND THEREFORE RECEIVES FUNDING FROM THE STATE FOR THAT CHILD'S EDUCATION THIS IS A VOLUNTARY- CONTACT WE HAVE DEVELOPED RACE ETHNICITY GUIDES FOR THE DATA DISAGGREGATION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT AS YOU ALL KNOW BECAUSE NOT ALL TRIBES. I HAVE THE SAME CULTURE AND SO WE WANT STUDENTS TO BE ABLE AND THEIR FAMILIES TO HELP IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES FINALLY I THINK GERMINAL DONAL HAD TALKED ABOUT- TRAINING SO IN ADDITION TO THE TRAINING THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR TEACHERS ARE IN THE FORM OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND IN THEIR TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. THIS YEAR WE ACTUALLY MADE A REQUIREMENT FOR TEACHERS AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATORS- OUGHT TO RECEIVE A MANDATORY A PERCENTAGES OF THEIR TRAINING TEACHERS I THINK IT'S 15% OF THEIR RECERTIFICATION HOURS MUST BE DEVOTED TO. LEARNING ABOUT MULTI CULTURAL HISTORY. AND CULTURE. FOR A MINUTE THERE'S A PARTICULAR ADDITION OF 5% OF THEIR CERTIFICATION HOURS MUST BE DEVOTED SPECIFICALLY TO DEVELOPING GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP. AND THAT THAT CURRICULA IS ACTUALLY APPROVED BY THE TRIBES AND PROVIDED BY THE TRIBES. FINALLY AND THIS IS- A NOTE TO A REP ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA WE- WE STAND NATIVE NAMES AND SYMBOLS AND IMAGES FROM SCHOOLS FROM SCHOOL TEAMS- JUST THIS YEAR AND SOME OF THE MOST MOVING TESTIMONY THAT I HAVE HEARD IN MY COMMUNITY. CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE STUDENTS WHO TALKED ABOUT THE TRAUMA OF HEARING. AND SEEING IMAGES AND HEARING NAMES THAT WERE INTENDED TO BE DISPARAGING AND DISRESPECTFUL. IN THE FUTURE WE DO HOPE TO CONTINUE OUR WORK BOTH IN OFFERING INTO THE EARLY LEARNING. ARENA OF FOR STI TRADING FOR LIFTING UP DUAL LANGUAGE TRAINING FOR OUR- NATIVE STUDENTS TO NOT FORGET THEIR NATIVE TONGUES. AND FINALLY TO- HOPEFULLY CREATE A SEPARATE BODY WHEREBY AN ACCORD OR AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENTS CAN EXIST BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE OF WASHINGTON. AND THE SEPARATE TRIBES BECAUSE CURRENTLY THE CENTENNIAL ACCORDING MILLENNIAL AGREEMENT ONLY- AFFECT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I WILL END UP BY SAYING OUR EFFORTS IN WASHINGTON STATE HAVE ALL FOCUSED ON. WHAT OUR MOTTO ON THE HOUSE EDUCATION COMMITTEE WHICH IS TO BE STUDENT CENTERED AND SUCCESSFUL COST WHERE WE FIND STUDENT ENGAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL. TO SUCCESS. AND THAT THAT ENGAGEMENT NEED MUST BE BASED ON MEANINGFUL RELEVANT CURRICULUM AND TRUTH TRANSFERABLE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS. I DO OFFER THIS ARE CLOSING- AS I SAY I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE OVERVIEW OF WASHINGTON STATE'S EXPERIENCE I WISH TO STAY GREAT SEED. THANK YOU- YOU YOU HAVE COOPER I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT ARTIST ONLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON HAS EVOLVED FROM THE WHERE THE FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND NOW TO WHERE YOU'RE AT AT THIS TIME WE LIKE TO CALL ON SENATOR MCCOY- WE'VE ASKED THE MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE ALLOW HIM ACCESS I UNDERSTAND HE'S GOING TO BE OFFERING TESTIMONY. THROUGH OUR PHONE LINES. SENATE DEMOCRATS YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING- A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE EXCELLENT JOB ON THE LAW. THE HISTORY OF- HOUSE BILL. FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE- THIS THIS LEGISLATION. OUR BEGAN THEY ARE RIVALED STATE MEANING I WAS BEING HELD ON THE CLAN ALL NUMEROUS PATIENTS. WE CAN NOT TO THOUSAND THREE. AND- SO THAT'S WHERE- THAT WAS MY FIRST YEAR. I IN THE LEGISLATURE AND SO I WAS OUT THERE TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL. AND OUR EVENTUALLY WELL THE QUESTION WAS THAT WHAT WHAT IS IT IS THE TRIBES WANT. AND- A TRAVEL LEADERS STOOD UP AND SAID WE WANT OUR TRIBAL HISTORY AND CULTURE TAUGHT. IN THE SCHOOLS. SO THAT BEGAN THE PROCESS- WHICH CREATED HOUSE BILL FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE. THEN AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT VEHICLES- GOOD GOOD STORY- THAT- THE PRESENT OF SOME SALT THOSE- SPOKE ABOUT MY GRANDSON GOING THROUGH. MORE OF SECOND GRADE WITH THE U. H. THAT THEY'RE REALLY UPSET ME AND NOW WHEN HE CAME ALL. AND TOLD ME ABOUT IT NATURALLY I WENT DOWN TO THE SCHOOL AND MOM LET THEM KNOW ABOUT MY DISPLEASURE. SO- SO. THERE'S JUST SHOWS. HOW QUARTERLY- HISTORY HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT TRUMP GROUPS. SO THE BILL WILL GET THE BALL- THERE'S A LOT OF TRIBAL INVOLVEMENT- IT'S THE TRIBES. WHO- THEIR HISTORY. CLICK TRIED TO HOLD LANGUAGE. SELBYVILLE THE INDIVIDUAL THAT- ARE THE KEEPERS- OF THEIR HISTORY AND LANGUAGE AND SO- WE ALSO DID ANOTHER BELL. THAT- BASICALLY SAYS THAT- IT'S TO TRY. THAT CERTIFIED SOMEONE IN OUR LANGUAGE. AND NOT A- ALL RIGHT ALSO IN ART HISTORY- S. T. E. R. IT'S A VERY- GOOD DOCUMENT AND- WHAT IT PROVIDE IS BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT ALL CHARGE. SO WHEN YOU GET IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE CREATION OF THE TRIED- IN THEIR LANGUAGE- THAT COMES FROM THE CHART- SO. HAVE THAT SUPPORT NETWORK COMPANIES STRONG. SO- WE ARE- WASHINGTON SAY THAT SLOWLY BUILDING- IT A CLOUD NATIVE AMERICAN- CAGING GROUP. AND- SO IF THAT IS GROWING- WE HAVE- OKAY- HELLO TRY TO REMEMBER- SHE- IN THE TEACHING OF- PRINCE. AND THEN- SHE DOES THAT WORK AND THEN HER HUSBAND. IS THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON. AGING SUPERINTENDENT. THEN THIS IS IMPORTANT AND YOU YOU NEED TO WORK WITH YOUR COLLEGES OF EDUCATION. TO ENSURE THE FOLKS THAT THE- COMIC TEACHERS. THEY GET THE EDUCATION ALSO. THEN THAT DAY BE ABLE TO TEACHER IN A MANNER THAT'S RESPECTFUL. TO THE TRIBAL NATIONS. VERY IMPORTANT- HELLO YOU YOU MAY HAVE LEGISLATION HERE YOU DID AT THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM YOU ALSO NEED LEGISLATION COULD. COLLEGES OF EDUCATION- SO- ALL THAT TOOK A LOT OF WORK ON. AND- IT'S GROWN AND- AGAIN- THE REPRESENTED SANTIAGO GOOD GOOD A LOT OF THE HISTORY- ON THE LEGISLATION. AND SO I I'M AT A POINT WHERE WE JUST NEED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR WORK- NOT ONLY IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON BUT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE NATION AND LEADING- THE INDIAN PEOPLE THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE NATION ARE MOVING FORWARD A PIECE OF LEGISLATION- AND ALSO- RECOGNIZING CINEMA BECAUSE I AS A MEMBER OF THE- TO ALLOW THE TRIBE IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON- SO MUCH HAS BEEN DONE. ON TO- ENGAGE IN THE LEGISLATURE THEIR WASHINGTON FROM EARLY BEGINNINGS OF SEEING WHAT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HIS GRANDSON SCHOOLS THAT PROMPTED THAT THAT THAT PASSION TO SEE A CHANGE MOVE FORWARD I THINK- REPRESENTATIVE US ON THOSE FOR SHARING A TESTIMONY OF WHERE THE STATE OF WASHINGTON HAS COME FROM- FROM THE FIRST. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL TO WHERE YOU'RE AT NOW AND I WOULD ONLY HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO START WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE YOU STARTED OFF AT AN ULTIMATELY GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. ARMED WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE DICE MANY QUESTIONS FOR REPRESENTATIVE SIMON SENATOR MCCOY. FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. THANK YOU TEREMOS UM MAYBE. JUST A CO. YEAH I WERE TO THANK REPRESENTATIVES. FOR BEING WITH US AND I DO THINK THAT THE STORY THAT YOU SHARED AT THE BEGINNING IS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE IT'S SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE- OF. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. OF WHAT THEY CAN AND- CAN DO. AND HOW THEY APPROACH STUDENTS WHETHER THEY SEE THE CULTURE THAT STUDENTS BRING WITH THEM. AS A PLUS. OR THE MINUS. AND TOO OFTEN IT'S BEEN THE LATER- AND- STUDENTS I THINK OF ALL CULTURES BRING SUCH RICH EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. AND DID THE JOB OF EDUCATORS IS TO VALIDATE THAT EXPERIENCE. AND NOT TO DO THE OPPOSITE WHICH IS TO DISCARDED- THE HISTORY I THINK OF NATIVE AMERICANS AND WITH BOARDING SCHOOLS WHERE THEY STE STRIPPED. STUDENTS OF THEIR CULTURE- IS THAT LONG HISTORY AND- I THANK YOU. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE THIS MORNING TO HELP AS. DO MUCH BETTER HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I JUST HAVE A YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ANY OF ANY OTHER ANYBODY ALSO DIVES GERMAN. JUST JUST A FOLLOW UP- QUESTION AS FAR AS I MIGHT IDENTIFIED- AND TALKING- WHAT THE- CHAIRMAN DONALD ALLUDE TO AS FAR AS RESOURCES BEING AVAILABLE RIGHT RESOURCES THAT HOPEFULLY ARE APPROVED BY THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT ULTIMATELY. TEACHERS ARE ABLE TO USE BECAUSE WE HEARD- AND IN TESTIMONY EARLIER THAT AT ONE POINT THERE WAS A HIGH A 5% NATIVE AMERICAN TEACHERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THIS WOULD BE ON TOP BY NON NATIVE TEACHERS BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CURRICULUM IS ONE THING IN THE IN THE CHAIRMAN SO ELOQUENT BRINGING UP THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE CLASSROOM. HOW DID THE STATE OF WASHINGTON DEAL WITH THAT COMPONENT- CONTINUE TO MOVE PIECES OF LEGISLATION FORWARD TO FURTHER- AWARENESS OF THE NATIVE. AMERICAN PEOPLE THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS CHAIRMAN FOR THAT. AND I DON'T. WANT TO SOUND AS IF I AM- BEING MAKING LIGHT OF THE QUESTION BUT OF COURSE EVERY STATE KNOWS. THERE'S NEVER GONNA BE ENOUGH MONEY. TO DO. THE BEST THAT WE PLANT THEM UP AND YET AT THE SAME TIME WE DO HAVE A WEALTH OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AT OUR DISPOSAL AND THAT'S WHY I THINK SO. IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE BEDROCK OF HOSTILE FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE THE FOCUS ON THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE RICH CONTENT HISTORY. OF A AND KNOWLEDGE IS ACTUALLY AS SENATOR MORE QUARRY ALREADY INDICATED. IN THE- THAT. IT'S IN THE HANDS ARE AND THE PROTECTION OF OUR TRIBES. AND SO IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR WE AS NOT ONLY A STATE REPRESENTATIVE OR STATE OFFICIAL BUT ALSO FOR US TO ENCOURAGE OUR OTHER LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS TO LEARN HOW TO ENGAGE IN THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP IN AN AUTHENTIC AND RESPECTFUL FASHION. I WILL SAY ALL OF THE OTHER THING THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO. IS AND THIS IS NOT TO GET INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT IN A VARIETY OF PLACES WHETHER IT WAS UNDER THE OLD NCLB FRAMEWORK OR UNDER THE NAME S. A FRAMEWORK. WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD IN- BOTH REQUIREMENTS AROUND- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING FOR CULTURAL COMPETENCY WE WERE ABLE TO- BUILD IN ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH THE- FOUR TIERED SYSTEM. OF EVALUATION OF WE WERE SO IT WAS A- IT WAS A MANUAL OF BOTH- CARROTS AND- STICKS I SUPPOSE OUGHT TO HELP. OF THAT ALREADY EXISTED IN OUR SYSTEM WHERE WE JUST ADDED TO IT ON AND USE WHAT WAS ALREADY AVAILABLE TO US. ON INCLUDING AGAIN THE RESOURCES THE RICH RESOURCES OF OUR TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND SENATE MCGUIRE WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD TO THAT. THOSE COMMENTS. YEAH IN THE BEGINNING OF UNDER. FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE- THAT'S WHY WE PUT SUCH AN EMPHASIS. ON- THE TEACHERS AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE TRIBES GETTING TOGETHER AND WORKING TOGETHER- IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY CURRICULUM- AGAIN IT'S YOU TRIED THAT THAT- HAS YOUR CREATION STORY AND THAT'S WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT. SO- THERE THE HOLDERS OF THAT STORY. SO THEY NEED TO WORK WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE DELIVERY. AND NOW IT'S THE LEOPARD- THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO WORK WITH THE COLLEGES OF EDUCATION. TO H. THEM ON HOW TO DEVELOPER THE STORAGE- BECAUSE- ALL TRIBES- OUR STORYTELLER AND. SO THE TEACHERS CREATURE THAT WAY SO THAT THE STUDENTS ALL UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS BEING DONE. AND NOW IT GETS CLEANED OUT OF. IF THE STORY CORRECT. I WANT TO THANK- THE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL- THAT BROUGHT TO LIGHT- AGAIN HISTORIC INFORMATION TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND- TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- MERRY LEAVE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVE OF SANTOS IN SENATOR MCCOY FOR BRINGING TO LIGHT THE ISSUES AND TROUBLESHOOTING THROUGH SOME OF THE BILLS AND IMPLEMENTING ALL THESE PIECES OF LEGISLATION.

TO AFFORD THIS MAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEY YOU. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO A PANEL NUMBER THREE. AGAIN PANEL NUMBER THREE WILL FIRST HEAR FROM CENTER WEBER INDIAN EDUCATION SPECIALIST. WITH THE SAMBAR DINO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IT WAS JOINING US IN PERSON I BELIEVE. THERE SHE IS. COME FORWARD WHEN YOU PERCEIVE AND READY. MISS WEBER. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN ROSS AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. MY NAME IS SAM COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR JUST COULD YOU MOVE THAT MICROPHONE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER SUIT. HELLO AS FAR AS HEARING YOUR VOICE THANK YOU. OKAY MY NAME IS SANDRA WEBER. I AM A DESCENDANT OF THE LAKOTA NATION MY LOOK UP THE NAME. I HAVE WORKED FOR THE SAMBAR TO DINO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TITLE SIX INDIAN EDUCATION PROGRAM. FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE PROGRAM SINCE ITS CONCEPTION IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. THE PROGRAM HAS ITS ORIGINS IN THE WORK OF TRIBAL ELDERS FROM THE SAN MANUEL BAND OF MISSION INDIANS WHO FOR DECADES WENT TO LOCAL SCHOOLS TO SHARE THEIR SERRANO CULTURE WITH LOCAL AREA STUDENTS WHILE EXPLORING GRANT PATHWAYS. TO CONTINUE THESE PROGRAMS. THERE AT. THERE ADVOCACY AND PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR EDUCATORS HELPED ESTABLISH A GRANT FOR INDIAN EDUCATION IN THE DISTRICT WHICH IS STILL BEING USED TODAY. THE TITLE SIX PROGRAM MAKE SURE THAT ALL FOURTH GRADE TEACHERS HAVE THE CURRICULUM TO TEACH THE TRUTH. ABOUT CALIFORNIA INDIAN HISTORY. INCLUDING A RESOURCE BOOK ABOUT THE SAN MANUEL TRIBE CALLED PEOPLE OF THE PINES WITH ACCOMPANYING LESSON PLAN THAT MEETS DISTRICT AND STATE STANDARDS. FOR THE PAST TWENTY TWO YEARS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S TITLE SIX INDIAN EDUCATION PROGRAM HAS PARTNERED WITH SALMON WELL TO BRING STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ON FIELD TRIPS AND WORKSHOPS. FOR THE WEEK LONG CALIFORNIA INDIAN CULTURAL AWARENESS PROGRAM HELD IN HONOR OF OUR STATE'S NATIVE AMERICAN DAY. I COORDINATE WORKSHOPS THAT BRING TEACHERS IN FROM ALL OVER OUR DISTRICT AND DO FOLLOW UP WORK AT THEIR SCHOOL SITES WITH THE INFORMATION LEARNED FROM THE TRIBALLY LED WORKSHOPS. AND FIELD TRIPS FOR STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY TO PERSONIFY THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN EXPERIENCE I EMPLOY THE BOOK. LAND OF OUR ANCESTORS BY GARY ROBINSON WHICH IS GIVEN TO EVERY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LIBRARY AND CLASSROOM IF REQUESTED. THIS BOOK PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE TYPICAL TEACHING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MISSION PERIOD. MISTER ROBINSON'S BOOK WRITTEN FROM A SHOE MATCH CHILD'S PERSPECTIVE SHOWING THE REALISTIC PAIN AND SUFFERING OF CALIFORNIA INDIANS DURING A BRUTAL PERIOD IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. AND I HAVE BROUGHT YOU ALL A COPY OF THE PUT. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A MORE ACCURATE TALLY OF THE MISSION ERROR IN CALIFORNIA OUR CURRICULUM ALSO PROVIDE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE MANY NAMES OF CITIES STATES MOUNTAINS. AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT LANDSCAPES THAT ORIGINATE FROM CALIFORNIA NATIVE PEOPLES AND THEIR LANGUAGES. THE CREATION OF CURRICULUM THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE EXPERIENCE BOTH IN THE PAST AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE UNDERSTANDING APPRECIATION FOR DIVERSITY AND EMPATHY THAT IT CREATES LET ME SHARE WITH YOU AND IT- INCIDENT. THAT ILLUSTRATES THIS POINT. I HAVE A STUDENT WHO WHEN HE WAS IN SECOND GRADE. WAS BEING BULLIED VERBALLY AND PHYSICALLY ABOUT HIS LONG HAIR. AND FOR HAVING A DIFFERENT NAME. WHEN THE PLAYGROUND WRECKAGE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT HIS COMPLAINTS HIS MOTHER AND I WORKED WITH A FOURTH GRADE TEACHER TO HAVE BEEN GO TO HER CLASS IF YOU IS HAVING ANY. PROBLEMS HE WAS NOT DOING WELL ACADEMICALLY. DUE TO THE BULLYING AND HE DID NOT FEEL A SENSE OF BELONGING TO HIS SCHOOL. TODAY AT THAT YOUNG WARRIOR. ACHILLES WAR CRY HEART THE WALLACE. IS IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL LAST YEAR TO EIGHTH GRADE HE FINISHED NUMBER ONE. OF IN HIS CASS BY SHARING HIS NATIVE CULTURE WITH HIS CLASSMATES THEY WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CERTAIN THINGS THAT THEY MAY NOT EXPERIENCE IN THEIR OWN LIVES. BUT OUR IMPORTANCE TO OTHER COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT EXPERIENCE HE HAS BLOOD STEM ACADEMICALLY AND SOCIALLY. HAVING CALIFORNIA INDIAN HISTORY IN OUR CURRICULUM IS NEEDED NOT ONLY FOR OUR NATIVE STUDENTS TO FEEL SEEN HEARD AND VALUED BUT FOR ALL STUDENTS TO BENEFIT FROM LEARNING ABOUT NATIVE TRADITIONS AND CULTURE. WE HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN WE INCLUDE IN DEPTH AND HISTORICALLY ACCURATE NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM ARE NATIVE STUDENTS ARE AFFIRMED. THE IMPACT IS SIGNIFICANT AND REAL. TO FURTHER EXPLAIN SALMON TO DO YOU KNOW CITY IS A DISADVANTAGED SOCIO ECONOMIC AREA THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS APPROXIMATELY. FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE STUDENTS. I WORK WITH APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED SELF IDENTIFIED NATIVE STUDENTS IN GRADES K. THROUGH TWELVE. FOR THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION DASHBOARD LAST YEAR OUR DISTRICTS NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS HAD CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM DROPPED BY FOUR POINT 3% AND THEIR SUSPENSION RATE DECLINED BY 4% IN THE. NINETEEN TWENTY ACADEMIC YEAR BURKE IN INDIA AND- GROWGENERATION RIGHT WAS 95% THE HIGHEST IN CALIFORNIA UTTARAPATHA RESERVATIONS AND THAT IS SOMETHING I AM VERY PROUD OF.

I GREW UP IN SHASTA COUNTY AND I. WANT SHASTA COUNTY. AND I QUIT SCHOOL. YOU KNOW THE BEGINNING OF SEVENTH GRADE I JUST COULDN'T TAKE THE ABUSE THAT WAS AT THE SCHOOLS THE NON BELIEFS IN OUR WAYS OUR TRADITIONS OUR CULTURE YOU KNOW I HAD A LOT OF ABSENTEEISM BECAUSE OF CEREMONY AND EVERYTHING AND SO I'M GRATEFUL THE STATE. AND THE I'M REPRESENTATIVES HAVE PUT LEGISLATION FORWARD TO ALLOW THAT. IF WE COULD JUST EXPAND ON THAT AND YOU KNOW MAYBE POSSIBLY. GROW THAT WHERE WITH A LETTER FROM THE TRIBAL LEADER OR SOMETHING YOU CAN WRITE SOMETHING TO THE SCHOOL TO ALLOW THOSE CHILDREN TO GET CREDITS. OR CAN BE IN THEIR SERMONS IN CEREMONIES AND THINGS AND SO THAT COULD BE SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT YOU ADD TO THE BILLS THAT EXPAND ON BECAUSE- THERE'S VALUE IN OUR CULTURE. WE WERE AND I ASKED THEM LATEST. AFTER LOCALS AND ALL THESE THINGS WE ARE SPEAKING A LANGUAGE THAT IS FOREIGN TO ME I'M NOT ABLE TO TRULY EXPRESS MYSELF WHEN I LAUGH I LAUGH BECAUSE I WAS TAUGHT YOU SHOULD LAUGH AT THIS BUT I TRULY WOULD LIKE TO WHEN THEY SPEAK. IN MY LANGUAGE YOU GET AND HOW A HUMOR MY PEOPLE GET ICING IN THE OLD PEOPLE WHEN THEY SPOKE IN THEIR LANGUAGE AND IT WAS A LOT MORE YOU KNOW AND I BELIEVE WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT EVENTUALLY. BUT THESE BABY STEPS WE'RE TAKING IS BENEFICIAL. AND ARE. I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS IT IS HARD BECAUSE SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO GO BACK INTO AND TALK ON. BRING UP A LOT OF THE MOTIONS. THANK ARE. YOU KNOW CHILDHOOD TRAUMAS INSTRUMENT I WAS IN SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW. I'M GOING TO. I SPOKE ENGLISH BACK MY PRONUNCIATION AND SO I HAD TO GO TO SPEECH THERAPY EVERY DAY THERE WAS A LITTLE BAND VAN OUTSIDE OF PROJECTS TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND I HAD TO GO OUT THERE AND HE I- APPROVED AND YOU KNOW LEARN ONLY SOUNDS AND STUFF AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF WEIRD BECAUSE I LOOKED AROUND AND I WAS YOU KNOW THIS LITTLE. BLACK AND BROWN SKINNED INDIANS IN THERE AND I THOUGHT WHAT'S WRONG WITH CASH NOW I'M PRETTY SURE SPEAKING ENGLISH BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I SAID IN THAT. STATE OF INDIAN. OR OVER THERE INSTEAD OF OVER THERE AND NOW A LITTLE BIT OF MY- INDIAN IS THAT I HAD THEY TOOK FROM ME IN THE SEVENTIES EVEN THOUGH I WAS SPEAKING. ENGLISH MY DOCTOR'S WORDS THAT ACCENT FROM MY GRANDPARENTS AS THEY TALKED AND SO EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ENGLISH. IT WAS I GUESS EIGHT OF DIALECT BUT THEY REMOVED THAT AND- NOW YOU KNOW WHEN I DON'T HAVE MY OWN PEOPLE BACK. I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE WHEN AS I GOT OLDER AND I WOULD TALK WITH THEM THEY WOULD STILL STICK OVER THERE THE INDIANS AND I WAS LIKE IN THE END YOU KNOW AND I FELT SO. AWKWARD AND IT MADE ME THINK. THAT'S STILL WITH MY LANGUAGE BUT YET IT WAS REMOVED BECAUSE IT WASN'T APPROPRIATE AND AFTER THE STANDARDS. AND SO I. BELIEVE YOU KNOW WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE. YOU KNOW. THESE THINGS ARE BETTER FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. AND OUR ONLY GET BETTER AND I WHEN I THINK THE CHEST CAN IT RIGHT TO PUT IT IN THE IN THE CLASSROOM WORK.

AND REP THAT READ TO READ JUST OPEN UP AND IT WAS GIVEN. ME A LOT OF THINGS GOOD TEACHERS TO REMEMBER STERN I ALSO THE STUDENTS AND SEE THEMSELVES IN THE PRINTER- INSTEAD AS WE HAVE CHILDREN TO REFRESH YES THIS IS IBM. THIS HAS EVER REALLY BAD CONGRESO. WITH THOSE WHO SAID OUR ROADS AND COUNTY AT AMERICAN ADVENTURE GIVING INPUT TO SAY. LIVES CAN. NEVER PRESENTED WITH BEFORE AND AS A REAL TRASHED I. WOMEN'S TOGETHER.

THANK YOU FOR THAT AND DID YOU- REMIND ME- IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU MENTIONED THE- THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN POPULATION WITHIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SOUTH THAT YOU REPRESENT. THE SIR I AM REPRESENT SHASTA COUNTY RETIREMENT FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN. ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS OVERALL JUST OVER 4% OF THE POPULATION. OF THE COUNTY I HAVE STUDENTS. THANK YOU- AND THAT MAKES UP THE POPULATION OF THE SCHOOL ITSELF ABOUT 4% NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS. THAT IS CORRECT. IN TALKING ABOUT IT I REALLY DO. ASSEMBLY BY ISRAEL SOME WAS MET WITH AND SERVICE ANY THAT ONE WORKING ON A TRYING TO HELP THEM CENTERS WHAT CHECK. BOX THE MINISTRATION FROM SCHOOL THAT PUT INTO THE- OF OR MORE RACES READ. AMERICAN AND THAT'S WHEN I WE ARE EITHER RESEARCH IS REALLY DEVELOPED IS. TO EACH ONE OF THE SCHOOL AND SHALL COUNTY THIS STE THERE'S SOME BUTTONS SELECT. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE COUNTY IN CONSIDER IN I ABOUT STARTING AND THAT. THANKS THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR THAT I ALSO- RESELLER THIS LEVEL OF EDUCATION- WE SEEN IN ROUND VALLEY THE HIGH POPULATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS THERE WAS ANYWHERE FROM 6270% OF THE STUDENTS THAT WERE THERE SO. THE POINT IS TO HIGHLIGHT THAT EVEN THOUGH WHEN WE SEE THE DEMOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS OF THE STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOMETIMES IT IS BETWEEN 12% THERE'S POPULATIONS IN THE STATE THAT MAKE UP HERE IN THIS CASE- OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS NATIVE AMERICAN. IN IN ROUND VALLEY IT WAS AS HIGH AS SO JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AND BRING THAT FORWARD MISTER CHIP. I JUST. MAYBE THIS IS PROBABLY A QUESTION FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT- IT DO YOU DO YOU ANY SCHOOL SITES REALLY THEY THEY ARE CONSIDERED A SUBGROUP. YOU WHAT DO YOU WHAT IS A HUNDRED STUDENTS TO BE A HUNDRED STUDENTS OR- ANYTHING. PLUS THIRTY PLUS. PLEASE CHECK. YES WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF BAD DISTRICTS THAT DO HAVE ENOUGH STUDENTS TO BE COUNTED AS A STUDENT GROUP. THANK YOU. BUT AGAIN YOUR POINT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YEAH I THINK WOULD YOU YOUR POINT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THEIR CONTENT THE STUDENTS CONCENTRATED MAYBE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS IN ACCOUNTING BUT- THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION AB CONCENTRATED. AT CERTAIN SCHOOLS THIS. OPEN IN THE IN THE COUNTY. AFTER THAT WARRANTS THE FOR DISCUSSION OF THE LOCAL- INPUT INTO THE CURRICULUM AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT SHERMAN POTTER WE TRIED TO MAKE A COMMENT- YEAH I WAS JUST STATING THAT I DO BELIEVE ALL NUMBER IS LOW BUT STRONG- LIKE OUR IHS A SERVICE AREA ACCOUNT FOR A SHASTA COUNTY. WE HAVE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND NATIVE AMERICANS REGISTERED THAT ARE HEALTH FACILITY. AND SO I'M NOT SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE. YOU KNOW ABOUT SIX OR. SEVEN THOUSAND SO THAT NUMBER TWELVE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND THE TESTIMONY THAT YOU PROVIDED I FIND IT VERY RESOURCEFUL AND AN EDUCATIONAL WHAT'S GOING ON IN LOCAL AREAS AND IDENTIFYING. SUBPOPULATIONS THAT COULD WARRANT FURTHER DISCUSSION THAT'S THERE- SYNDROME YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH- THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN DAY CONFERENCE AT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SAN MEDINA WHICH WE ARE RUN- MYSELF AS THE CULTURAL ADVISOR- FOR- THE PEOPLE ASIDE THIS BEEN WELL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. N. N. WHAT WE FOUND DURING THAT CONFERENCE IN ITS IT'S GEARED TOWARDS THIRD AND FOURTH GRADERS TO COME IN AND LEARN ABOUT THE FACTUAL SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE WE SHARE TRADITIONAL SONGS. UBER'S SONGS BE COURTSHIP SONGS AND BASKETRY TO FIT INTO THE ARTS THERE ARE THERE- AND TO DATE WE FIVE EDUCATE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND THIRD AND FOURTH GRADERS FROM OUR REGION- WE ALSO SEEN- THE NEED. TO THE CHAIRMAN'S- COMMENTS AS FAR AS RESOURCES SO WE INCORPORATED A TEACHER CONFERENCE- AS PART OF THAT CONFERENCE WHERE WE ACTUALLY BRING NATIVE AMERICAN EDUCATORS- FORWARD. TO BE ABLE TO GIVE LESSON PLANS AND APPROVED- THROUGH THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THERE FROM THE INDIAN PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE USED IN THE CLASSROOM. CAN YOU- TOP A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THAT IS INVOLVED TO FILL THAT GAP AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AGAIN BRINGING THOSE RESOURCES INTO THE CLASSROOM- THERE IN THE SAN MARINO ERIN HOW THAT'S EVOLVED WITHIN THAT CONFERENCE. WELL DURING THE- TEACHERS WORKSHOPS- THEY LEARN. DIFFERENT WAY. TO T. AND NATIVELY- THEY HAVE THE BOOK THE PEOPLE OF THE PINES AND THERE'S- CLASS LESSONS IN THERE AND AFTER THE WORKSHOP AND THE STUDENTS FIELD TRIPS WERE. THEY ARE ALL EXCITED- I GO WHERE IT AFTERWARDS AND- TAKE THE LESSONS FROM PEOPLE THE PINES OR- SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE HAVE MADE UP WITH- YOUR EDUCATION DEPARTMENT. AND PRESENT THAT TO THE FORTY THIRD AND FOURTH GRADE CLASSES. SO I CONTINUED ALL YEAR. THE POINT IS LIKE X. WHAT'S GOING ON IN SHASTA COUNTY AS FAR AS A LOCAL INVOLVED WITH THE LOCAL TRIBES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE- THE TIMES WE TRY TO PAN AMERICANIZED. ALL CULTURES ALL DIFFERENT- THINGS THAT ARE THERE SO HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S IS SO MUCH DIVERSITY DIFFERENT LANGUAGE LIKE WE'RE SERRANO MICHAEL WE HAVE. WE SAY HELLO AND SERRANO DIFFERENT THAN WE SAY HELLO IN CAREER. AND THE SONGS ARE DIFFERENT MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME SING TRADITIONAL- COOPER SONGS THAT WERE TAUGHT TO BE FUN MR ROBERT LEVI THE FATHER OF. THE FATHER LAW A MERRY LEVI AND ROBERT LEVI THIS THERE. BUT ALSO WHEN WE USE THE HOST THOSE ARE FOR SERRANO BEFORE SHE'D SUNG SO HAVING THAT. THAT DIFFERENCE RIGHT. WE CAN'T LOOK AT- ONE OVERVIEW FOR THE STATE SAY HERE NOW. HOW YOU TEACH ABOUT CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. MAYBE THE RESOURCES AND GETTING TO THAT COMPONENT. COULD BE THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF LOCAL ALLEY AS TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR LOCAL TRAVEL PEOPLE TO BUILD THOSE RESOURCES. THAT ARE THERE THAT MANY TRIBES ALREADY DOING BUT JUST HASN'T BEEN HIGHLIGHTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO MAYBE THAT'S A DISCUSSION COULD HAVE AS FAR AS A CLEARING HOUSE ARE. SOMEHOW WE LOOK AT THAT- BUT BUT IT IS HAPPENING I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT- THE THAT IN SAMBAR DINO. WE DO HAVE PART OF OUR COMPONENTS- THEY'RE TEACHING AGAIN SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. I'M INVOLVED IN THAT- BUT TEACHER- CONFERENCE THAT GIVES MATERIAL TO TEACHERS TO USE IN THE CLASSROOM. THAT'S APPROVED BY THE LOCAL INDIAN PEOPLE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO USE IN THE CLASSROOMS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT I THINK THERE'S- A LOT OF WORK THAT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. TO ENCOURAGE THIS THIS RESOURCES- CLEARING HOUSE RESOURCES OR HOW YOU WANT TO GET THAT INTO THE CLASSROOMS. WHETHER IT'S AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR THE STATE ENCOURAGES THE LOCAL DISTRICTS TO ENGAGE. WITH THE LOCAL INDIAN PEOPLE SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WILL FURTHER DISCUSS UP MR CHANNEL WOULD BE OPEN. TO CONTINUING THAT DISCUSSION. THANK YOU ARM YOU MISTER.

THAT I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT IN ANY KIND OF DISCUSSION OF NATIVE AMERICAN EDUCATION- AND THAT IS CERTAINLY UNFORTUNATE- IT WEEK WE HAVE REFERRED TO THE PAST YEAR THE PAST SUMMER.

ENCOURAGED US TO PROVE TO OTHERS THAT WE COULD DO IT AND WE WERE SUCCESSFUL. THE CALIFORNIANS ARE SURVIVORS MOST OF YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES CONDENSE IT IT ALSO HAPPENED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO WITH THAT. THIS HISTORY CURRICULUM MUST BE APPROVED AND BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS A CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER. FOR HISTORY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MEAL AND MY NAME IS ROBERT LEVI I AM A MEMBER OF THE TOWARDS MARTINEZ BAND OF COURSE THERE'S A CREATE INDIANS FROM THERMAL CALIFORNIA. I YEAH WHAT YOU GUYS ALL TALKED ABOUT OF WHAT WE ALL TALKED ABOUT I AM THE PRODUCT OF I TAUGHT AP US HISTORY AND COLLEGE PREP U. S. HISTORY FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS IN THE UPLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH THAT THE CURRICULUM THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ESTABLISHED IN THE IN CALIFORNIA IS DRASTICALLY NEEDED. FROM WHAT THE TRIGONOMETRY TEACHER DID LAST WEEK TO WHAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF- MASCOTS IN RIVERSIDE NOTICED- BRAVES IT'S STILL THERE IN SAMBAR DINO ABSALOM A BRAVES IS STILL THERE WE NEED TO EDUCATE TEACHERS STUDENTS PRINCIPALS SUPERINTENDENTS EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED AS CALIFORNIANS IN TERMS OF THE CURRICULUM WHAT MY WIFE SAID EARLIER.

MY DAD'S HOUSE. THANK YOU JUST. HEY ON HEATHER HOSLER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN LEGAL SERVICES AND A MEMBER OF THE HOOP OF ALLEY TRIBE. AS WELL AS MOTHER TO TRIBAL MEMBER CHILDREN. AT THREE POINTS TODAY FIRST POINT IS IT CERTAINLY IS NOT THE LOCAL LEVEL. MIGHTN'T DURING A OF MY CHILDREN'S UPBRINGING I WAS IN SCHOOLS ALL THE TIME SAYING THIS CURRICULUM IS THAT RIGHT IT'S NOT FAIR TO MY CHILDREN. THEY SAID IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME DO A PRESENTATION. AND THAT WASN'T THE ANSWER MY CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER MY DAUGHTER WAS CORRECTING THE TEACHER AND THE PRONUNCIATION OF OUR TRIBE HOOPA TRIBE. SECOND POINT AT GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS MATTER LOCALLY I THINK WE HAD SOME GREAT EXAMPLES TODAY FROM SHASTA COUNTY. AS WELL AS FROM THE HOOPA YUROK IT'S A NON WAY AND KRUG AREA THAT AT MARGO ROBBINS SHARED TODAY SO I THINK THERE'S SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OUT THERE. AS WELL AS OUR- OTHER STATE FROM WASHINGTON. GREAT RELATIONSHIPS UP THERE AND I THINK THEY HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF WE CAN'T USE WORDS LIKE ENCOURAGE. IT MUST BE SHALL I THINK STATEWIDE CURRICULUMS ARE IMPORTANT AS FRAMEWORKS BUT LIKE ASSEMBLYMAN RAMOS POINTED OUT. WE ARE NOT MONOLITHIC IT NEEDS TO BE APPLICABLE TO EACH REGIONAL AREA BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY. AND THEN MY THIRD POINT IS THAT NOT ONLY IS KNOWLEDGE BUILDING IMPORTANT IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM I THINK THAT'S ONE APPROACH BUT IT DEFINITELY THERE NEEDS TO BE KNOWLEDGE BUILDING. FOR FOLKS IN POSITIONS OF POWER. I'VE BEEN APPOINTED BY TWO GOVERNORS OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS WORKED WITH INTELLIGENT. WONDERFUL WELL INTENTIONED FOLKS WHO DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT TRIBES IS GOVERNMENTS AND SIMPLY SUMMER EDITION.

THIS WILL BE QUESTION THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION OF LOCAL IGNORANCE AND THIS WILL CONTINUE WITHOUT REAL IMMEASURABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR SUCH BEHAVIORS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA I HAVE COME TO EXPECT MORE FROM OUR EDUCATORS ALIENATING NATIVE CHILDREN AND CREATING BARRIERS TO THEIR SENSE OF BELONGING HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OUR CHILDREN AND LEARNING OUTCOMES.
