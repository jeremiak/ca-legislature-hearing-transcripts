AUTO INSURANCE IS A ZERO SUM

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.712
SYSTEM THE WAY IT WORKS IS AN

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:50.614
INSURER COLLECTS PREMIUM AND

00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:52.716
FOR THOSE PEOPLE IT PROVIDES A

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:54.151
DISCOUNT TO IT MUST

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:55.886
COUNTERBALANCE THOSE DISCOUNTS

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:57.521
WITH SURCHARGES TO OTHER

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:00.624
MEANT BY A ZERO SUM STUFF SOME

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:01.759
OF CALLED IT IN THE WAY OF

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.460
SQUEEZING A BALLOON WHERE IF

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:06.897
YOU HAVE A SQUEEZE ON ONE AND-

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:07.498
IT MUST FLOW TO THE OTHER SIDE

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:08.566
OF THE BLUE AND IT'S THE SAME.

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:10.901
SYSTEM OF MONEY IT HAS BALANCE

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.870
OUT THAT'S THE SOME NATURE WE

00:41:12.937 --> 00:41:15.372
FIND BASED UPON OUR STUDY THAT

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:20.511
DRIVERS WHO RECEIVE. DIRECTOR

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:22.246
AND YET WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:24.949
FIND AFFINITY GROUPS FOR

00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:26.550
DRIVERS LIKE A FACTORY WORKER

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:27.985
THAT BALANCE OUT SO WHAT

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:29.687
HAPPENS IS IT IS FOLKS WHO ARE

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:31.088
FACTORY WORKERS THOSE WERE NOT

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:33.290
DESIGNATED INFINITY GROUP THAT

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:36.961
PAY FOR THE DRUG THE DRIVERS

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:37.561
THEY GET THOSE DISCOUNTS SUCH

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:40.030
AS IT GIVES. WHAT WE- TOUCH

00:41:40.097 --> 00:41:42.132
WHICH IS A TWO TIER SYSTEM

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:43.901
WHERE THOSE WHO MAKE LESS GET

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:45.436
CHARGE HIGHER RATES SO THAT THE

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:46.904
CURRENT AFFINITY GROUP SYSTEM

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.939
BECOMES A PROXY FOR ONE'S

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:50.507

00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:51.675

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:16.760
TWO THOUSAND HOWEVER. THAT'S

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:18.095
NOT THE FIGURES THAT I WOULD

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:20.631
HAVE AS FAR AS- INCOME IN MY

00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:22.966
AREA AS FAR AS AN AVERAGE

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:25.002
INCOME SO. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.670
YOU CAME FOR THESE TWO YEARS

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.705
ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:30.641
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON A

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:32.709
COUPLE OF POINTS SO THAT THE

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:36.246
FIGURES COME FROM. CENSUS DATA.

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:36.813
THERE IS A COMPANY AS REPEAT

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.651
DEMO. THAT US INSISTS. FOR PER

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:43.320
CAP INCOME FOR ZIP CODES THAT'S

00:48:43.387 --> 00:48:44.621
THE DATA SOURCE. I WANT TO

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:45.756
EMPHASIZE WHAT PER CAPITA

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:47.424
INCOME GAINS HEARING BECAUSE IS

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:48.992
AN IMPORTANT TIME TO DO THAT.

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.427
PER CAPITA INCOME IS NOT THE

00:48:50.494 --> 00:48:51.795
SAME THING AS AVERAGE SALARIES

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:54.197
SO. WHAT PER CAPITA INCOME

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.667
MEANS LET ME JUST TAKE AN

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:57.334
EXAMPLE OF A FAMILY OF FOUR.

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:59.169
YOU HAVE LET'S SAY A HUSBAND

00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:02.973
AT. A SPOUSE TO CHILDREN. BUT

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.875
IN THE HOUSE TURN ONE HUNDRED

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:05.876
DOLLARS AND OF COURSE THE

00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:08.478
CHILDREN HAVE NO INCOME SO TWO

00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:09.379
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:11.114
THAT FAMILY OF FOUR YOU TAKE

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:12.249
THE TWO HUNDRED DIVIDED BY

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:14.384
FOUR. AND THE PER CAPITA INCOME

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:15.419
OF THAT HOUSEHOLD IS FIFTY

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:17.387
THOUSAND. TWO I DO BESIDES THAT

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:19.456
WHEN YOU SEE A FIGURE LIKE LIKE

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:21.291
A TWELVE THOUSAND THAT MAY NOT

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:24.594
BE THE SALARIES OF THE PEOPLE

00:49:24.661 --> 00:49:25.228
DISTRICT. IT'S ON A PER CAPITA.

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:30.867
SO IF. TO DO AVERAGE. INCOME

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:33.003
FOR THE HOUSEHOLD WITH THAT

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:38.742
CHANGE THIS AT. THE GLEE.

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:41.645
RATHER BUT A I'M JUST ASKING

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:44.081
POLICE SUBMIT TO YOU THAT WHEN

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.148
WHETHER YOU LOOK AT THIS ON A

00:49:45.215 --> 00:49:47.317
PER CAPITA BASIS OR JUST AN

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:49.553
INCOME EARNER BASIS THE TRAINS

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:51.121
WILL REMAIN THE SAME. IF YOU

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:52.522
LOOK AT THE REGIONS OF THE

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:54.458
CITIES WHERE YOU SEE. ALL THESE

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:57.027
HOW THESE. ARE GETTING MORE AND

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:58.395
LESS AFFINITY GROUPS. THAT'S

00:49:58.462 --> 00:49:59.663
GOING TO EXIST THESE ARE THE

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.264
DROP IN THESE CATIONS

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:03.233
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE'RE

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.604
TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU SUGGEST

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.706
THEY WERE GONNA REMAIN THE SAME

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:10.474
IS A REASON WHY WE DIDN'T USE

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.209
INCOME BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:13.844
WOULD RELATE TO INCOME MORE

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.612
THAN THEY WOULD PER CAPITA. AND

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:16.646
IT'S A FAIR POINT ASSEMBLY

00:50:16.713 --> 00:50:18.849
MEMBER. THE RESOURCES WE HAD US

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:20.050
CENSUS DATA AND AS RE

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:22.085
DEMOGRAPHICS DATA WERE THE BEST

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:24.221
TOOLS WE HAD TO USE BASED UPON

00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:26.423
THE STUDY. IT EITHER CONCERT

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:27.724
OTHER WAYS TO SHOW THE SAME

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:30.160
IMPACT. THANK YOU. MISTER

00:50:30.227 --> 00:50:31.661
COOPER. TO QUESTION SO

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:32.863
OBVIOUSLY YOU WANNA DO IT

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:34.931
DISCOUNTS FOR THE STUDY GROUPS.

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:36.166
BUT WILL STILL BE OTHER

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:36.733
DISCOUNTS IN THE INSURANCE

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.669
ARENA FOR OTHER THINGS CORRECT

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:40.604
THAT IS CORRECT AND THEN ON THE

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.439
AS FAR AS CLAIMS GOOD. THE TWO

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:44.007
DIFFERENT GROUPS YOU'RE MISSING

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:47.477
HERE. FOR THE CLAIMS OF TO HIRE.

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:49.146
LOWER GROUPING BUT SINCE. WE

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:49.713

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:51.915
THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.917
QUESTION AND- AND I SHOULD

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:55.919
EMPHASIZE WHAT ARE DATA DOES

INFORMATION WE RECEIVE WE STUDY

00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:05.262
JUST. ZIP CODE LEVEL. VEHICLES

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:06.663
WHO GETS GROUPS WHO DOES NOT A

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.532
QUESTION WE CONTINUE TO ASK

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:11.301
INSURERS AND AGAIN WOULD VAST.

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:11.768
WE HELD A WORKSHOP IN

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:13.036

US. IF POOR DRIVERS BECAUSE

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:22.979
POOR DRIVERS LESS EDUCATED

00:51:23.046 --> 00:51:24.648
DRIVERS ARE REPRESENTED HERE.

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:26.850
WHY WHY IS THAT WE'VE NOT

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:30.420
RECEIVED AN ANSWER TO THAT

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:31.021
DATA TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OR-

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:32.622

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:34.224
RISKIER DRIVERS. WE JUST

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.928
FOLKS TALKS ABOUT UNINSURED LAW

00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:38.929
OF PEOPLE NEED TO CARRY MORE

00:51:38.995 --> 00:51:40.597
UNINSURED MOTORISTS INSURANCE

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:41.798
THESE DAYS RICHARD MOTORS

00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:44.067
THAT'S A BIG ISSUE. IS DOES

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:44.901
THAT FACTOR THAT I MEAN THERE

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:46.203
ARE A LOT OF OTHER. MOVING

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:47.871
PARTS TO THIS SO I'M TRYING TO

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:49.439
WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT I THINK

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:50.607
THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMMON

00:51:50.674 --> 00:51:51.975
ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER IT THERE

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:52.976

THIS BUT I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU.

00:51:54.744 --> 00:51:57.347
THAT FOR THOSE DRIVERS WHO ARE.

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:59.182
JUST GETTING BY BUT PURCHASING

INSURANCE WHICH IS REQUIRED BY

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:02.118
LAW. IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:04.621
DISCOUNTS THAT IS NOT HELPING

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:06.223
AN UNINSURED MOTORIST ISSUE IT

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:07.958
IS MAKING IT WORSE. WE'RE

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:08.658
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:10.393
CHOOSING WHETHER TO BUY

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:17.334
DRIVERS ARE SAFE DRIVERS AND

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.536

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:50.934
COMBAT CENTER AND MY GUESS IS

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:54.037
THAT MIDDLE THE MEN AND WOMEN

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:55.205
WHO ARE IN THE MILITARY- ARE-

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:58.742
PERCENT A PRETTY CLOSE TO IT.

00:52:58.808 --> 00:52:59.743
IS THAT ACCURATE. ALL OF YOUR

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:01.177
IS THERE ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAYES

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:02.746
THAT THAT IS TWENTY NINE PALMS

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:05.015
THE GREEN AREA YOU SEE AND THE

00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:06.216
REASON WE DIDN'T HIGHLIGHT THAT

00:53:06.283 --> 00:53:07.517
AREA IS WE WERE WE WANTED TO

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:08.485
MAKE SURE WHERE WE SHOULD

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.253
HIGHLIGHTED THESE BALLOONS THAT

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.622
WE HAD A STATE CREDIBLE AMOUNT

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.124
OF DRIVERS WITHIN THAT ZIP CODE

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.759
AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.360
YOU JUST HAD TEN DRIVERS AND IS

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:18.728
IT CODE. NOT A VERY

00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:19.629
STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.398
SAMPLE- SO WE WANTED TO

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:22.933
HIGHLIGHT ZIP CODES THAT HAD AT

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:25.201
LEAST A THOUSAND VEHICLES A

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:26.303
THOUSAND AND EIGHTY TO BE

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:27.470
PRECISE WAS DETERMINED AS THE

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.472
RIVER ABILITY SO THAT'S WHAT

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:31.975
HIGHLIGHT COMES BUT TO SET THIS

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:34.444
SUMMER MAYES UNDER THE CURRENT

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:36.046
SYSTEM. HELLO TERRY MEMBERS DO

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:39.049
BENEFIT FROM A GROUP OUT UNDER

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:40.750
THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:42.185
ARE NOW DRAFT WORKS SET

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:44.454
MILITARY MEN WOULD CONTINUE TO

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:50.226
BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THOSE

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:54.164
LONG AS THEY AT A LOWER RISK

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:57.968
ACCESS. WE'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE

00:53:58.034 --> 00:53:58.602
IT SEEMS THOUGH IN YOUR-

00:53:58.668 --> 00:53:59.202
TESTIMONY THAT YOU'RE MAKING

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:02.038
THE CASE. ALMOST AS IF. THE

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:02.739
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:04.040
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:06.443
POOR PEOPLE- BUT I DIDN'T QUITE

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:09.079
HEAR THAT DIRECTLY- ARE ARE YOU

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:10.547
SUGGESTING THAT INSURANCE

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:11.715
COMPANIES DON'T WANT POOR

00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:13.383
PEOPLE TO BE TO JOIN AFFINITY

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:16.386
GROUPS- AND IF. THAT IF THAT'S

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:18.388
THE CASE WHAT WE DO TO RESOLVE

00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:20.123
THAT THAT'S- I APPRECIATE THAT

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.891
QUESTION ASSEMBLY. TO BE CLEAR

00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:23.994
ON. WE ARE NOT. CERTAIN THAT

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.395
INSURERS ARE INTO ITALY

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:27.197
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST DRIVERS.

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:29.633
BUT WHAT I THINK IS TELL IS

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:31.368
THAT THAT THE TESTIMONY I READ

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:32.002
TO YOU FROM WANTING FOR COMPANY

00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:35.305
IT'S- TENDS TO DISCRIMINATE. IS

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:37.207
IN IT TO MAKE MONEY I MEAN IF I

00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:39.175
WERE AN INSURER AND I DIDN'T

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:40.510
CARE TO MAKE MONEY I WOULDN'T

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:42.379
BE IN INTERPHALANGAL. AND AS

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:44.948
WE'VE HEARD FROM TESTIMONY.

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:47.250
FROM THIS INSURANCE COMPANY

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:49.519
CALLED CURE. HIGHER INCOME

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.554
DRIVERS OFFER A LARGER REVENUE

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.056
STREAM. SO THERE IS A PRE

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:53.823
ELECTION A PREFERENCE FOR

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.959
HIGHER DRIVERS THAT MAY BY MORE

00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:57.794
PER. IT'S THAT THAT IS A BETTER

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:58.995
PROFITABLE INVESTMENT FROM

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:00.764
INSURERS PERSPECTIVE AND

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:05.669
PROBABLY THERE IS LESS ENERGY

00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:06.236
FOCUSED ON POOR DRIVERS THAT

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:07.003
ARE AS LIKELY TO PERCH MULTIPLE

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.238
PRODUCTS. IT'S AN INTENT TO

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:10.040

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.480
A AT THIS POINT I'M NOT EVEN

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:40.982
SURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:43.751
APPROVAL FILING LIKE IMPORTANT.

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:45.153
FOR THREE DECADES INTO THIS IF

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:46.054
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.255
THOUGHT ANY GROUP THAT'S

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:49.624

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:50.224
INAPPROPRIATE THEY WOULD HAVE

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:52.260
DISAPPROVED. YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:53.494

CHANGED PRICE FOR THAT GROUP

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.236
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:04.472

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:05.773
A FAIRLY ARDUOUS PROCESS- WE

THE BEST THING THE DEPARTMENT

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:09.343
COULD DO. IS TO MAKE THE

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:12.013
APPROVAL OF GROUP- PROGRAMS

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.915
EASIER- SO THAT IT'S SOMETHING

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:15.116
CARRIERS WOULD BE MORE LIKELY

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.051

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:17.585

KNOW MY GRANDFATHER WHEN HE

02:14:19.151 --> 02:14:21.853
FELT VERY WEAK THIS WAS BACK IN

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:23.588
THE FORTIES. HE HAD STRUGGLE

02:14:23.655 --> 02:14:27.058
WITH HIS BODY AND THE ADVICE-

02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:29.694
FOR HIS HEART PROBLEM WAS TO

02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:32.364
DRINK A LOT OF CREAM. AS IN TO

02:14:32.431 --> 02:14:33.999
STRENGTHEN HIMSELF AND TO

02:14:34.065 --> 02:14:36.468
FATTEN HIMSELF UP. OBVIOUSLY

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:38.170
THAT WAS THE MEDICINE THAT WAS

02:14:38.236 --> 02:14:39.337
ABSOLUTELY CONTRARY TO

02:14:39.404 --> 02:14:40.172
EVERYTHING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE

02:14:40.238 --> 02:14:41.940

SOMETIMES PROBLEMS ARE EGGNOG

ARE RECOGNIZED AND I THINK THAT

02:14:48.013 --> 02:14:49.080
COULD THE DEPARTMENT HAS

02:14:49.147 --> 02:14:51.917
IDENTIFIED A CHALLENGE OF A

02:14:51.983 --> 02:14:54.653
LACK OF EQUITY BUT THE SOLUTION

02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:56.822
IS NOT TO JUST TAKE IT AWAY

02:14:56.888 --> 02:14:58.824
FROM EVERYONE. THE SOLUTION IS

02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:00.158
TO GO JUST IN THE OPPOSITE

02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:02.327
