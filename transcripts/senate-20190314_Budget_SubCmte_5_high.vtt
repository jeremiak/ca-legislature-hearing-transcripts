00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.055
THEY HAVE SEEN THE DATA AND THEY

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.658
HAVE DECIDED TO INVEST IN SOME

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.360
OF OUR COURT.

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:08.227
FROM THAT.

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:08.961
AND WE HAVE A VERY GOOD

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:12.131
RELATIONSHIP WITH A RURAL HEALTH

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:13.099
AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH COURT IS

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.101
ACTUALLY FUNDED PROP SIXTY THREE

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:15.568
DOLLARS.

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:18.571
ON SO THERE'S NO ONE FORMULA

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:20.239
IT'S JUST TRYING.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:21.374
TO GET --

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.209
MID TO MATCH --

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.978
RESOURCES THE NICE PART ABOUT

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.446
FOR US WOULD INNOVATION DONE OUT

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.715
LOUD US TO DO IS LEVERAGE OTHER

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:33.319
SOURCES IN COMBINATION WITH THAT.

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:34.587
AND THEN BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:34.887
[inaudible]

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:35.454
AN OVERALL.

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.423
SO BUT IN THAT RESPECT WOULD YOU

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.858
CALL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.960
RANT SOURCES AVAILABLE NOW.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:42.762
BUT IF THOSE GRANTS SOURCES WERE

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:45.198
TO GO AWAY I MEAN IS THIS.

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:47.700
I ASK ABOUT --

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:48.334
FOR SURE YOU KNOW HOW IN A WAY

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.303
THE QUESTION I'M REALLY TRYING

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.904
TO GET IS IS THIS A PRIORITY OF

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.473
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IF.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.042
IF FROM MY POINT OF VIEW OF THE

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.376
JUDICIAL COUNCIL ITSELF IS NOT

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:59.011
DIRECTING SOME PORTION OF ITS

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:00.646
FUNDS TOWARDS HIS PURPOSE.

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:03.482
AND IS JUST RELYING ON THE

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:06.018
CREATIVITY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL OR

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:07.687
TO GO AND PURSUE GRANTS.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.823
THEN IT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.459
MAN -- WAYS

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:16.429
WHAT LEVEL PRIORITY AND I'M.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:17.830
I THINK THAT.

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.166
I'M SURE THERE'S A VARIATION

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.034
DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.471
AND THE WHAT THE POPULATION IS

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:26.205
THEY'RE DEALING WITH WITH THE

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.140
AXE OR PARTICULAR CLLABORATIVE

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:28.808
COURT.

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.776
BUT OVERALL THE REPORTS I'VE

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:32.345
SEEN IS THAT.

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:37.450
THEY ARE A RATHER SUCCESSFUL ON

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:40.820
I MET THE DAD THE STATE IS

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:42.555
EMPLOYING.

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:43.489
TO APPROPRIATELY DEAL WITH A SET

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:48.361
OF FOR WHOM.

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:50.696
HOLDING INCARCERATION ALONE OR

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:52.298
EVEN COUNTY JAIL ALONE.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.066
IS NOT GOING TO ADEQUATELY

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.001
ADDRESS.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:09:00.273
AND SO SLOW BUT TALK A LITTLE

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:02.241
BIT MORE ABOUT THE JUDICIAL

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:04.577
COUNCILS PRIORITY ON THIS --

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:07.013
WELL FIRST. ONE THING THAT THAT

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:08.281
I WOULD SAY IS YOU ARE

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:09.982
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT CRAP

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.784
FUNDING CREATES THAT KIND OF AN

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.252
IN.

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:15.187
INSTABILITY IN MAY MAKES YOU

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.723
WANT RESCUE ALWAYS.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.724
GO OUT THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTE.

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:20.026
ON THE OTHER SIDE THOUGH THE ONE

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:20.993
THING.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.395
I SPEAKING.

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:25.998
OF JUDGES ENCOUNTER AND COUNTIES

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.267
ARE ALL INDIVIDUALLY

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.369
CONSTITUTIONALLY ELECTED.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:31.771
NO PROGRAM.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:34.307
YOU HAVE A JUDICIAL COMMITMENT --

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:36.509
AND AND NO JUDGE.

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:38.511
THE JUDGE WHAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:40.479
TO DO AND HOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT --

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.814
SO YOU DO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.283
DOES DIRECT THE FUNDING TO OUR

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.319
COURT THE TO THE COURTS YES.

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:47.086
YES.

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:47.987
DID YOU HAVE TO IF YOU WANT TO

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:49.956
BE EFFECTIVE YOU HAVE TO GET BY

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.757
YOU HAVE TO GET THAT BUY IN FROM

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.125
FROM THE JUDGES --

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.560
AT LEAST IN MY OPINION I'M GONNA

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.562
I'M GONNA REFER THE JUDICIAL

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:57.897
COUNCIL QUESTIONS TO THOSE LOCK

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.432
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN WORK MORE

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:00.166
CAPABLE OF ANSWERING THAT THE

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:01.500
MIND --

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:04.036
BELIEVED TO MY CONCEPT OF WHAT'S

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.738
HAPPENED WITH THE INNOVATIONS

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:06.372
GROUNDS.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.441
ON THE GROUNDS HAS BEEN REALLY A

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:11.711
FACTOR THE COURTS WANT TO MOVE

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:12.778
FORWARD --

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:15.281
TO MOVE FORWARD --

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:16.849
YOU KNOW AND THEN KIND OF CAN

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:18.184
COULD KIND OF BE A MOP.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.386
OTHER JUDGES WILL COME IN SO I

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.555
THINK THAT EXTENT --

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:23.322
WHAT'S HAPPENED HAPPENED RIGHT

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:24.824
NOW -- HAS

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.959
ALLOWED US THE COURTS TO MOVE

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:27.727
FORWARD --

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.795
I'LL WORKERS WELL I'LL LET YOU

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:31.364
CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION IN A

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.964
MINUTE BECAUSE I'M GONNA ASK A

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.466
DIFFERENT.

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:35.234
ONE AND THEN ARE YOU MAY --

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:39.572
OPINE ON BOTH BUT THE OTHER

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:40.373
THING I'M INTERESTED IN IS.

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:41.640
WHICH COLLABORATIVE COURTS HAVE

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:47.279
THE HIGHEST CASELOADS.

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:48.047
IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DO IT FOR

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.715
US.

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:52.018
OF THE D. Y. COURT I ESCAPE.

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:52.785
OKAY --

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.320
BECAUSE WE HAVE STRUCTURED IT AS

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:55.154
MAN.

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:57.089
EVERY REPEAT YOU I OFFENDER IN

00:10:57.156 --> 00:11:00.493
IN MYCOUNTY IN OUR LARGEST.

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:04.830
IN STOCK AND HOUSE TO GO IN

00:11:04.897 --> 00:11:06.198
UNDATED THEY CAN ASSESS THE GET

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:09.001
TRAILER GET COUNT ABILITY

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:10.603
MONITORING IN PLACE THEN WE EVEN

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:12.304
IF NEEDED AND WE ABOUT WHEN WE

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:13.239
EVALUATE THEM.

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:15.708
SO ALEX PEAK I HAD A THOUSAND

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:16.609
PEOPLE IN THERE WERE NOW DOWN TO

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.711
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OR THREE

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:21.514
HUNDRED AS IT WORKS THE FINDINGS

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.448
AND EVERYTHING I'VE GONE

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.350
DRAMATIC DOWN ON YOU ARE SITE

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.851
BECAUSE WE BROUGHT

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:26.752
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TO PLAY.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:28.587
ON THE OTHER COURT DATE FOR MY

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:29.789
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT I THAT

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:33.759
I IS GROWING IN IS THE COMING

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.061
WAVE OF THE FUTURE IS MENTAL

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:38.464
HEALTH BEHAVE.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.000
ALMOST ALL THE THROUGH US HAVE

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:43.202
THESE TRAUMAS THAT ARE ON

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:44.603
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BASED ROCK

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.905
KIND ALMONDS.

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:47.173
AND IF WE REALLY WANT.

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:49.408
TO BE A FACTOR WE NEED TO BRING

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:51.110
BEHAVIOR HALL IN.

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:52.845
BY THAT TREATMENT SO THOSE ARE

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:55.214
THE TWO THAT I SEE --

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.248
BIGGEST NEED.

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:57.850
A SEMI.

00:11:57.917 --> 00:11:59.218
FINAL QUESTION GRASS OF MY

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:00.586
COLLEAGUES GOING IN.

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.421
IS HOW IS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:04.623
AND YOU CAN ADDRESS THE OTHER

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.194
QUESTION I MENTION BUT HOUSE

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.563
JUDICIAL COUNCIL MEASURING OUR

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:12.031
COLLABORATIVE COURTS.

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:14.033
AND IN THE CASE OF FOR EXAMPLE

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.634
THE JUDGE JUST DESCRIBED THAT

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.470
THE DO YOU I CORD IS MANDATORY

00:12:17.536 --> 00:12:18.437
SO WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:21.040
THAT WOULD BE FUNDED DIRECTLY BY

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.742
JUDICIAL COUNCIL VERSUS GRANTS.

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:25.444
IN TERMS OF THE THE MEASUREMENTS

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:28.614
AND KNOW THAT THE INNOVATIONS

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:30.082
GRANT FUNDING DOES HAVE A LOT OF

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.184
DATA NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.919
ITS OF THE PROGRAM'S

00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:35.554
EFFECTIVENESS AND WHETHER OR NOT

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.523
THERE'S VIABILITY GOING FORWARD --

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.691
UNDER TO WHAT EXTENT --

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:40.493
JUDGE CAN SPEAK TO THROUGH THE

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.061
INTERACTIONS OF THE OTHER

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:43.129
ADVISORY COMMITTEES WHAT KIND OF

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:45.231
DATA IS BEEN GATHERED AND WHAT

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:46.465
ARE YOU DOING AT YOUR CORD --

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:48.100
CPARS IF MEASURING THE FACT THAT

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:51.537
THE REASON I ASKED IF I WAS

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.404
ASKING WITH THE JUDICIAL.

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:53.405
AS WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS.

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:54.940
HOW MUCH ARE WE TREATING THIS IS

00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:56.075
JUST SOMETHING THAT IN A WAY

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:58.444
EVEN IF IT'S IN FOUR HUNDRED

00:12:58.511 --> 00:12:59.044
TWENTY FIVE JURISDICTIONS HOW

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.246
MUCH ARE WE READING THIS IS JUST

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:01.714
SOMETHING THAT SELECTIVE?

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.149
AND HOW MUCH IS THAT A PRIORITY

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.350
NO I UNDERSTAND AND AT THIS

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:04.717
POINT --

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:06.719
AREN'T SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS THE

00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.220
EACH COUNTY DOES HAVE IT GETS

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:09.755
ITS ALLOCATION AND AND IS --

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:10.823
THE JUDGES DISCUSSED --

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.926
THEY ARE ORTIZ AND ALSO THE

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:15.261
NEEDS IN THE OF THE LOCAL

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:16.295
COMMUNITY --

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:17.563
AND ALSO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.565
RESOURCES BY THE LOCAL JUSTICE

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:23.102
PARTNERS IT WAS A STATE ONES.

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:26.172
THAT WAS DONE AWHILE BACK ON ON

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:28.274
THE DRUG FORCE HIMSELF.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.209
ON THERE HAS NOT REALLY BEEN

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:31.177
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS.

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:33.612
IS REALLY KIND ARE THERE'S

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:36.215
DIFFERENT WORDS ARE TARGETING.

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:37.316
PROBLEM.

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:37.883
SO IF YOU HAVE A HOME COURT

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.486
RECIDIVISM ISN'T NECESSARILY --

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:41.387
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:44.256
OUT THERE LOOKING AT CONNECTIONS

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:45.424
OF SERVICES ANOTHER KIND.

KIND OF KIND OF STRUCTURES AND

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.994

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.417
TO COURT REPORTERS AND OUR

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:48.485
ALLOCATION OF FUNDING TO LAST

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:50.620
YEAR WHEN WE DISTILL JUDGES FOR

00:49:50.687 --> 00:49:52.989
A LITTLE BIT LONGER --

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.592
SO CLEARLY THE LEGISLATURE BACK

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.194
IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN FELT

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.995
THAT FIFTY ADDITIONAL JUDGES

00:49:59.062 --> 00:50:00.297
WERE NEEDED.

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:01.565
BUT DIDN'T FIND THEM AND

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.066
PROBABLY WE COULD SAY MAYBE THAT

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:04.468
WAS WHY IS.

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:06.370
BECAUSE GIVEN THAT THE RECESSION

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:07.871
WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.306
THEY'RE VERY WHAT A CUT THEM.

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.541
BUT AND IT'S PROBABLY WHY.

00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:13.744
MORE HAVE NOT BEEN FUNDED SENSE

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:18.115
BECAUSE UP UNTIL YOU KNOW UNTIL.

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:18.582
TWENTY FOURTEEN A NEW

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:20.717
ALLOCATIONS TO MOST DEPARTMENTS

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.119
WERE REALLY BEING MADE.

00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:22.986
I'M.

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:25.122
BUT THAT SAID THINGS HAVE

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:27.090
CHANGED A GREAT DEAL SINCE TWO

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.759
THOUSAND AND SEVEN OF THE FUNDS

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:31.762
ONE LET IN THE COURTS SOME MORE

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:34.398
RESPONSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF RE

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.066
SENTENCING IN VARIOUS THINGS ON

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:38.368
THE OTHER HAND WE'VE CHANGED.

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:40.737
A VARIETY OF LAWS WHERE PERHAPS

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:42.305
THERE ARE.

00:50:42.372 --> 00:50:46.476
MORE OR LESS OF SET OF THINGS

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:47.844
THAT USED TO COME BEFORE THE

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:49.146
COURTS THAT AREN'T COMING BEFORE

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:50.247
THE COURTS.

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:54.384
SO I THINK CLEARLY AS REEVALUATE

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:57.354
WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER.

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:59.556
OF AND I'M NOT.

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:01.057
I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN TRY.

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:02.759
TO SPECULATE THAT WE COULD LAND

00:51:02.826 --> 00:51:04.528
EXACTLY ON WHAT WE THINK IS THE

00:51:04.594 --> 00:51:06.129
RIGHT NUMBER BUT AS WE TRY TO

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:07.197
EVALUATE.

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:08.665
WHAT IS?

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:10.434
THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER FOR US TO

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.235
AT THIS TIME FIND.

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:13.203
I'M.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:15.605
IT MAY BE WORTH FACTORING IN

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:17.307
SOME OF THOSE THINGS NOW IT'S A

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:19.242
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN NOW

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:21.211
AND WHEN WE ADOPT THE BUDGET TO

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:23.280
REALLY UNDERSTAND.

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:26.183
THE VARIETY OF CHANGES SINCE TWO

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:27.851
THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND NOW BUT

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:29.386
I'M HOPING THAT THE LA --

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:31.888
RATHER THAN IN ASKING YOU.

00:51:31.955 --> 00:51:33.390
TO DO.

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:34.891
FIND UPON THAT NOW.

00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:35.725
THAT YOU MIGHT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:38.962
GOING TO BE THE P. C. PEAS IN

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:40.430
THIS AREA.

00:51:40.497 --> 00:51:42.532
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE.

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.067
THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:51.208
SENSE OF OF ON KNOW WHETHER AN

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.742
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF CHANGES

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.578
AND WHAT KIND OF NEW DEMANDS ARE

00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:56.079
ON THE COURTS THAT MIGHT.

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:58.215
JUSTIFY EVEN ADDITIONAL JUDGES

00:51:58.281 --> 00:52:01.017
THAN WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE.

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:03.520
AND AGAIN NOT ASSERTING THAT WE

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:04.988
WOULDNECESSARILY HAVE THE

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:07.023
CAPACITY TO FUND THE ADDITIONAL

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.125
BUT OR OR WHETHER THERE'S A

00:52:09.192 --> 00:52:11.027
SENSE THAT ADDITIONAL ARE NOT

00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:11.728
NEEDED.

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.396
JUST SO WE CAN KIND OF GRAPPLE

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.765
WITH I MEAN ANY TIME WE ARE

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:17.400
GIVEN.

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:19.970
A PROPOSAL FOR YOU KNOW FIND EX

00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:21.605
NUMBER WHY NUMBER.

00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:23.373
IT'S GOOD FOR US TO TRY TO

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.708
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW HOW WE

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:27.210
LANDED ON THOSE NUMBERS.

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:29.813
SO -- IF LA --

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.481
CAN NOW THINK ABOUT THAT IN TO

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:33.483
SPEAK THAT AS WE GO INTO THAT

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.751
DISCUSSION THE FUTURE

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:35.051
[inaudible]

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:36.453
I'M NOW [inaudible]

LESS THAN TEN MILLION OF THAT

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:58.975
WENT. TO COURT REPORTERS.

00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:01.611
AND I WANT TO GET A BETTER

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.880
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY.

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.715
WHY THE FULL TEN MILLION WAS NOT

00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:07.150
DISTRIBUTED FOR IT WASN'T?

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:08.885
AND WHETHER IT WAS USED WHATEVER

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:10.654
WAS DISTRIBUTED WEATHER WAS USED

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.055
FOR COURT REPORTERS AS WAS OUR

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.041
IT IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:46.109
PEOPLE LEAVING THE WORK FORCE OR

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:51.975

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:56.012
ALL SHORTAGE.

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.714
I'M IS THERE.

00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:01.684
HAS THERE BEEN A A LOOK AT ALL

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:05.622
ABOUT WHETHER ON WE SHOULD BE.

00:57:05.688 --> 00:57:09.092
RE EXAMINE RE LOOKING AT WHAT

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:11.161

YOU KNOW WE COULD LOOK AT

00:57:22.806 --> 00:57:24.374
SALARIES AND SUCH.

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.709
BUT I'M IT COULD BE IT MAY NOT

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:28.244
BE SALARIES ALONE THAT ARE THE

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:29.779
REASON THAT WE'RE NOT BEING ABLE

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.247
TO FILL THESE POSITIONS AND I

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:32.782
THINK GIVEN.

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:34.551
THAT OUR COURTS NEED COURT

00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:37.086
REPORTERS TO FUNCTION ADEQUATELY

00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:38.755

FULL AGREEMENT ABOUT THE NEED TO

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:44.861
LOOK AT WHAT IS THE REASON IS

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:46.196
THAT THE COURT REPORTERS AT THE

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:47.630
CHALLENGES WERE FACING.

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.299
OFF ON IT AND WORKING WITH THE

00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:50.500
COURT REPORTER BOARD.

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:53.102
YOU KNOW THAT ENTITY SEEMS LIKE

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:54.771
THE LIKELY PARTNER THAT WE WOULD

00:57:54.838 --> 00:57:55.738
NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:57.373
WITH I'M IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.042
YOU UNFORTUNATELY TODAY I'M NOT

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:00.143
IN A POSITION TO TELL YOU

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.611
SPECIFICALLY.

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:02.078
THE STATUS OF THOSE

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:03.980
CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU ARE

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:04.781
HAVING THEM.

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:07.617
I I I CANNOT SAY CONCLUSIVELY

00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:09.752
THE WHEN AND HOW OFTEN WERE

00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:11.454
HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS YEAH

00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:13.623
I KNOW THAT IT IS A PIECE OF THE

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:15.291
DIALOGUE AMONGST THE CORE FAMILY

00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:17.994
ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WERE FACING.

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:20.363
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW FREQUENTLY

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:21.831
WE'VE MET WITH THE BOARD ON THIS

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:24.334
TOPIC THOUGH.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.135
RIGHT AND I MIGHT ADD THAT.

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:28.404
FROM WHAT WE HAVE HEARD AND

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:30.073
RECENT REPORTS.

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:32.275
THERE ARE FEWER SCHOOLS.

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:33.509
THERE ARE FAR FEWER PEOPLE

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:35.144
COMING INTO THE PROFESSION.

00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:36.913
AND STAYING WITH THE PROFESSION.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.281
AND IT'S REACHED A POINT WHERE

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.850
THEY'RE NOT ATTRACTING NEW.

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:42.785
INTEREST AS QUICKLY AS PEOPLE

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.621
ARE AGING OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:45.855
AND AGAIN THIS WAS SOMETHING WAS

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:48.791
FORECAST BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:49.659
TWENTY FOURTEEN AT THE NATIONAL

00:58:49.726 --> 00:58:51.928
LEVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO --

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:53.596
IT'S HAPPENING --

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:54.731
TODAY.

00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:56.933
AND SO IF A HUNDRED PEOPLE EVEN

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.701
ONLY FORTY EIGHT PEOPLE STEP UP

00:58:58.768 --> 00:58:59.802
TO TAKE THE TEST.

00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.671
THAT DEFICITS GONNA CONTINUE TO

00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:02.205
CLIMB OVER TIME THAT'S OUR

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:04.007
CONCERN.

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:06.242
BETTER MORE LUCK.

00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:07.210
I COULD JUMP INTO THIS

00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:08.678
DISCUSSION AND ASK YOUR STRANGE

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:11.781
QUESTION BUT THIS THIS SOUNDS

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:14.083
LIKE IT COULD BE REPLACED BY.

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:18.788
VIDEO TAPES AND ALL THE REST SO.

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.223
IS IT THAT WAY I WOULDN'T

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:21.958
INCENTIVIZE ME TO WANT TO GO

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:24.193
INTO A PROFESSION THAT COULD BE.

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.862
ELIMINATED IN IN ONE BROAD SWEEP

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.563
HOW DO YOU MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.265
BECOME COURT REPORTERS AND WHY

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:30.800
DON'T WE TRANSITION OVER BUDGET

00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:34.037
BECAUSE OF BOLD AS TO ASK --

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:36.806
WE CAN'T TRANSITION OVER BECAUSE

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:39.142
MY DECISION PERMITS US USE THEM

00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:40.977

COMPLETE STATE SYSTEMS USE OTHER

00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:49.919
TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS TO CAPTURE

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:51.521
THE RECORD.

00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:52.989
WE ARE PROHIBITED HERE IN

00:59:53.056 --> 00:59:54.991

TO SEE HOW IT.

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.395

WELCOME THAT --

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:08.698

NECESSARILY WE THINK THAT THAT'S

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:37.126
A DISCUSSION.

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:38.194

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.032
THAT WHICH YOU REPLACE IT WITH

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.667
THE TECHNOLOGY BUT RATHER WE

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.336

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE POSITION

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.809
THAT ARE SOMEHOW EXCLUDING US

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:01.077
FROM HAVING A WORK FORCE THAT IS.

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:03.179
AT IT ABLE TO FILL THESE

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:06.149
POSITIONS AND PERHAPS THEN THERE

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:08.851

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:09.886
TO THAT.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:12.021
BUT I THINK ANY OF US WHO HAVE

WATCHED FOR EXAMPLE THE CAL

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:14.857

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:33.643
THAN WHAT THOSE WORDS ARE ON THE

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.978
SCREEN AND SO CERTAINLY IF WE'RE

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:37.146
RELYING.

OPTIMAL FOR REPLACEMENT SO I I

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:05.007

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:25.794
AGO --

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.363
INDICATING THAT LOW INCOME

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:29.031
LITIGANTS ARE THAT THEIR RIGHTS

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.466
ARE BEING VIOLATED BECAUSE THEY

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:31.901

NINETEEN NINETY BY THE

LEGISLATURE AND HAS NOT BEEN

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.080
INCREASED SINCE THEN.

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:52.047
THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM

01:10:52.114 --> 01:10:53.682
RECRUITING INDIVIDUALS IT'S ONE

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:56.151
OF MANY PROBLEMS THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:57.686
HAS PASSED.

01:10:57.753 --> 01:11:00.322
LEGISLATION TO INCREASE.

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:01.790
THAT FEE A FEW TIMES.

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:03.359
I'VE BEEN VETOED A HAS NOT BEEN

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:05.060
SUPPORTED BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:06.362
OFFICIALLY --

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:07.563
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE THINK

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:09.965
COULD HELP IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.900
SOME OF THESE THESE ISSUES --

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:12.534
THE LASTING ALL ADDRESS BECAUSE

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.871
I KNOW SOME OF IS IS WHAT

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:17.473
HAPPENED WITH THE TEN MILLION.

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:18.607
I'M I CAN TELL YOU AND YOU'LL

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:19.475

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.843
HAPPENS BECAUSE IN SPECIFIC

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:21.877
COUNTIES.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.479
BUT AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:24.747
MEETING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:26.415
AND IF I HAVE THIS WRONG I CAN

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:27.883
BE CORRECTED BY THE VIDEO

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.019
IRONICALLY --

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:32.488
V. JUDICIAL COUNCIL MADE CLEAR

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.056
THAT IF THERE IS A COUNTY.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.324
THAT ALREADY IS PROVIDING FAMILY

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.792
LAW COURT REPORTERS OR IF

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:38.160
THEY'RE FULL OR YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.262
FULLY PROVIDING THE SERVICES IN

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:41.497
FAMILY LAW.

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:42.765
THEN THEY COULD STILL GET ACCESS

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.133
TO SOME MONEY AND USE THAT MONEY

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:45.367
FOR OTHER PURPOSES SO I WANT TO

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:46.535
BE CLEAR WHEN THEY SAID.

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:47.870
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE SAID IT

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.171
COULD ONLY BE FOR FOR FOR COURT

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.673
REPORTERS THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT

01:11:50.739 --> 01:11:52.441
OF A CABBIE ON ASTERISK AND IT

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:53.142
WAS A VERY BIG.

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:55.144
DEBATE I'M AT THE TIME THAT THE

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.312
JUDICIAL COUNCIL MADE ITS MOTION

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:58.313
IN THERE ARE CHANGES TO THE

01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.081
MOTION.

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:00.215
BUT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:02.151
LEVERAGE AND BECAUSE OF THAT YOU

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.887
WILL HEAR.

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:06.055
IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES.

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:06.989
REPORTER TO BE MOVED FROM ONE

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.223

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:09.692
DEPARTMENTS OVER TO FAMILY LOT

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:11.493

IT FULLY PROVIDE.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:15.597
POTENTIALLY IN FAMILY LAW.

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:16.699
THEY WER ABLE TO GET THAT MONEY

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:18.000
DO OTHER THINGS WITH IT AND THEN

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.535
THEY CREATE A PROBLEM.

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:21.070
IN OTHER CASES NON FAMILY LAW

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:22.204
CASES WHERE THERE WASN'T A COURT

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.005
REPORTER AVAILABLE YOU CAN HEAR

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:24.573
MORE ABOUT THAT LET ME JUST

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.241
CLOSE ON BEHALFOF ANOTHER

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:27.576
CLIENT BUT ON THIS ISSUE --

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:28.844
THE CALIFORNIA TERMS FOR

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:29.912
CRIMINAL JUSTICE WHICH IS

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:32.014
STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION FROM

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:33.282
DEFENSE LAWYERS.

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:34.817
AND HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.218
THEY'VE AUTHORIZED ME TO SHARE

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:37.453
WITH YOU.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:40.489
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN A THE

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:41.957
USE OF ELECTRONIC RECORDING

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.692
EQUIPMENT IN MISDEMEANOR CASES

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:44.827
AND GROWING.

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:47.229
AND THEY ARE EXTREMELY I'M

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:49.264
PLEASED WITH IT SO FOR THE BAR

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:51.100
THAT HANDLES THESE CASES THEY DO

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:53.001
NOT THINK OF TRONIC RECORDING

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:58.941
EQUIPMENT IS THE WAY TO GO.

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.809
ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG WAY TO GO

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:01.844
AND HAVE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.178
AND THEY HAVE TAKEN SITE --

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:06.248
IN THEIR CASES WITH ON GETTING

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:08.150
ACCURATE LOT OF VOICES TALK OVER

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:11.120
EACH OTHER IN AUDIBLE. SEVEN

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:12.387
ZERO HERE THE JUDGES SO THEY'RE

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:14.790
REALLY NOT HAPPY WITH SEEN IN

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:15.657
SOME COURTROOMS WHERE THEY'RE

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.259
INCREASING ELECTRONIC RECORDING

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.393
THERE --

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.928
BECAUSE A MOVE CORE PART IS THE

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:21.296
FAMILY LAW SO THAT THEY CAN USE

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:22.498
THE MONEY FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:25.033
OPPOSED TO I THINK THE INTENT.

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.502
OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:28.203
SUPPLEMENT THE COURT REPORTER

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:31.240
WORK FORCE AND I THINK SOME

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:31.740
COURTS OF TAKE COULD BE

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:32.975
SUPPLEMENT.

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.376
YOU KNOW JUST MAKE SURE FAMILIES

OTHER THINGS WITH THE MONEY IN

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:38.180
IN PART IS BECAUSE JUDICIAL

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.449

NUMBERS NOW THERE'S LIKE.

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:00.235
I'M SO NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:00.902
ABOUT --

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:03.405
SACRAMENTO IF I MAY SO AT

01:24:03.471 --> 01:24:05.607
SACRAMENTO GOT MONEY FOR FAMILY

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:10.178
HIRED. TWO FOR FAMILY LAW

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:11.613
HOWEVER IN THE MEANTIME THEY

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:13.982

HAPPENED THEY JUST INSTALLED E.

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:18.586
R..

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:20.021
IN -- THREE

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:21.790

SO -- WE

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:29.097
OBVIOUSLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:30.532
THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:32.734

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.486

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:53.988

NOT WORKING ON THE RECORD

01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:59.093
BECAUSE A REFUSING TO HIRE STAFF.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.896
SO DO WE NEED JUDICIAL POSITIONS.

01:25:01.963 --> 01:25:03.264
NOT JUST ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.866

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:08.963
ABOUT -- THE

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.965
ISSUE OF A COST OF LIVING

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.901
ADJUSTMENTS. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:18.273
TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR COST OF

LIVING ADJUSTMENTS IT IS VERY

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:21.643
DIFFICULT TO CONTINUE TO SERVE

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:22.710
THE PUBLIC --

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:24.479
EFFECTIVELY WHEN WE ARE

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:26.014
CONSTANTLY HAVING TO THINK ABOUT

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:26.681
HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:29.484

CONVERSATION ABOUT RETENTION AND

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:35.056
LOOKING AT THE COURT REPORTERS.

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.057
BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:37.492
JUST AN ISSUE THAT --

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:41.129
IS AFFECTING QUICKLY PUT.

01:26:41.195 --> 01:26:42.697
THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL COURT.

SO I'M HERE TO ASK THAT THE

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:45.800

CENTER OF CALIFORNIA WE

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:57.512
REPRESENT ALL THE CHILDREN IN

01:26:57.579 --> 01:26:59.247
FOSTER CARE IN LOS ANGELES

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:01.015
SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTIES.

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.317
AND JUST ONE OFFER OUR SUPPORT

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:04.686
BOTH THROUGH THE JUDICIAL ITEM --

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:07.221
WE ARE MANY OF OUR JUDGES AND

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:08.089
THE COUNTIES THAT WE PRACTICE

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:09.090
AND STRUGGLE WITH CRUSHING

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.658
CASELOADS AND WITHOUT THOSE

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:12.193
POSITIONS FILLED WE CAN'T MOVE.

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.128
ANY OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE

01:27:14.195 --> 01:27:15.763
MADE DON'T HAVE ANY EFFECT WE

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:17.065
CAN STAFF MORE ATTORNEYS IN THE

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:17.865
COURTROOM BUT IF THERE'S NO

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:19.367
JUDGE OR THE JUDGE IS STILL

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:20.501
TRYING TO GET THROUGH A VERY

01:27:20.568 --> 01:27:21.970
HEAVY CALENDAR IT DOESN'T SOLVE

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:23.471
THE WHOLE PROBLEM AND I THINK.

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.872
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE COURT

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:26.274
REPORTER P. SIMILARLY.

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:27.609
WE CAN'T BREAK UP THE COURT

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.544
SYSTEM INTO PIECES OF LAWYERS OR

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:32.180
JUDGES OR COURT REPORTERS OR

01:27:32.246 --> 01:27:33.448
DAFT BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE TO WORK

01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:35.149
TOGETHER TO MOVE OUR CALENDARS

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:35.850
ALONG.

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:37.318
THE IMPACT ON THAT FOR THE I'M

01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:38.353
NOT AN EXPERT ON THE COURT

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:39.954
REPORTER ISSUES ARE THAT THE

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.723
DIFFERENCES OF PERSPECTIVE. FOR

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:43.257
SURE BUT I CAN SAY THAT ON A DAY

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:45.026
I WOULD SAY ONCE A WEEK WE HAVE

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:46.294

CANNOT DO CASES UNTIL AT LEAST

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:50.865
AFTER LUNCH TIME BECAUSE THERE'S

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:51.799
NO COURT REPORTER.

JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS YOUR

01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:55.049
QUESTION.

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:58.886
OF OF WHY.

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:00.087
I BELIEVE IT WAS SOMETHING LONG

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:03.257
LINES OF WHY AREN'T THE STUDENTS.

01:31:03.324 --> 01:31:04.559
PASSING THE TEST AS THEY WERE

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:07.195
BEFORE.

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:08.696
OR FOR THAT MATTER WHY AREN'T

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:10.331
MORE PEOPLE APPLYING TO BE TO BE

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:11.365
A COURT ORDER.

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:12.967
YOUR QUESTION WAS A PERFECT

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.869
EXAMPLE THE RUMOR THAT WHY ARE

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:17.205
WE REPLACED WHY ARE WHY ARE

01:31:17.271 --> 01:31:18.472
ISN'T WHAT WE DO.

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:19.574
SO VALUABLE THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.243
REPLACED BY ELECTRONIC RECORDING.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:23.444
WHEN I START WHEN I WENT TO

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.112
SCHOOL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:25.680
THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION I

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:26.848
ASKED BEFORE I WENT TO SCHOOL

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:27.949
FOR SOMETHING OR WE'RE GOING BE

01:31:28.015 --> 01:31:28.549
REPLACED?

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:31.619
SO. THIRTY YEARS LATER.

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:33.588
I'M GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:36.224
I CAN DO WHAT NO MACHINE CAN DO.

01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:37.592
AND AS FAR AS GETTING AN

01:31:37.658 --> 01:31:39.126
ACCURATE RECORD WHICH IS WHAT

01:31:39.193 --> 01:31:41.395
EVERYONE WANTED FIGURE IN COURT.

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:41.996
AND YOU'RE HAVING THINGS TAKEN

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:43.431
DOWN -- I

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:44.799
CAN STOP PEOPLE.

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:46.000
PAPERS ARE CRUMBLING AND I CAN'T

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:47.301
HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING WHAT

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:48.369
PEOPLE CALL OFF WHEN THE DOOR

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:50.204
SLAM WHEN I DON'T KNOW WHICH

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:52.006
WORD THEY ARE DID YOU SAY ISSUES

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:53.140
ARE HIS SHOES.

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:53.841
NOT NORMALLY ON THOUGH THERE

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:55.142
TALK TALKING ABOUT SHOES OR

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.077
ISSUES.

01:31:56.143 --> 01:31:59.647
BUT ONLY A PERSON CAN MAKE THAT.

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:01.315
IN MY OPINION I PLAN ON LOOKING

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:02.483
INTO THIS BECAUSE THIS AFFECTS

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:04.352
MY CAREER.

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:06.320
THE SCHOOLS THE CORPORATE

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:06.921
SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW CHANGE THEIR

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:08.856
THEORY.

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:10.658
THEIR THEORY THAT'S OUR STOMACH.

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:11.792
AND THE NUMBERS WENT DOWN WE HAD

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:13.494
A 19%.

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:15.730
NOW 5%.

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:17.365
SO I PLAN ON LOOKING AT THE

01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:18.966
NUMBERS AND THEN WHEN THEY

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:20.167
CHANGE THE THEORY ON WHY WERE

01:32:20.234 --> 01:32:21.669
NOT PASSING.

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:22.336
BUT WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GET

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:24.005
INTO A PROFESSION THAT EVERYONE

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.640
SAYS WE CAN BE REPLACED.

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:27.575
WE CAN'T BE REPLACED.

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:29.610
AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:31.312
ATTORNEYS THE JUDGES THEY DON'T

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:32.747
LIKE THE ARE THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:35.016
SAY ABOUT IT I DON'T LIKE YOUR

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:35.616
THEY WANT A PERSON THEY WON A

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:36.417
COURT ORDER.

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.152
THEY WANT THE BEST MOST ACCURATE

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:39.453
TRANSCRIPT THEY CAN HAVE WHICH

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.888
IS WHAT EVERYONE WANTS.

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:42.189
SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE RIGHT

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:46.794
THANK YOU SO MUCH FREE TIME.

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.229
MORNING GOOD MORNING I'M SURE

01:32:48.296 --> 01:32:50.197
MANY MEMBERS MACHON CAST OF THE

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:50.831
SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:51.799
UNION.

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:53.367
SEIU REPRESENTS TRIAL COURT

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:54.635
EMPLOYEES AND THIRTY NINE COUNTY

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:55.603
SO I I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:57.338
SUM UP WHAT OUR OVERALL POSITION

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:58.706
AS AND THEN ANSWER.

01:32:58.773 --> 01:32:59.507
THE DRESS A COUPLE ISSUES THAT

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:00.141
CAME UP.

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:01.275
FIRST -- WE

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:02.510
WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO FOR THE

01:33:02.576 --> 01:33:03.411
DISCRETIONARY FUNDS WERE

01:33:03.477 --> 01:33:05.012
PROVIDED LAST YEAR AS WELL AS

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.547
THE ADDITIONAL FORTY SEVEN

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:07.415
MILLION THAT WENT TO THE MOST

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:08.783
UNDER FUNDED TRIAL COURTS.

01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:10.651
WHAT THAT DID WAS ALLOW ALL

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:12.920
COURTS TO BENEFIT A MODEST

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:13.821
AMOUNT FROM THE SEVENTY FIVE

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:14.488
MILLION?

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:15.990
AND THEN GIVE THAT EXTRA AMOUNT

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:19.160
TO THE YES TO THAT --

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.761
THE EFFORT WAS TO EQUALIZE

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:22.196
FUNDING AMONG THE TRIAL COURTS

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:23.998
WITH A FINITE POT OF MONEY SO

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:24.665
YOU HAD.

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:27.068
DONORS AND RECIPIENTS SO LAST

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:28.669
YEAR WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:31.038
KIND OF ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:33.007
SCENARIO WAS WAS RECTIFIED --

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:35.276
WE HOPE TO SEE SOME FUNDING --

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:36.777
AGAIN THIS YEAR ALLOCATE IN A

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:38.045
SIMILAR MANNER --

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:38.946
FOR THOSE MOST UNDERFUNDED

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:40.348
COURTS EQUALIZER FUNDING BUT

01:33:40.414 --> 01:33:42.516
ALSO TO ALLOW OTHER TRIAL COURTS

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:44.318
THAT WERE ALSO UNDER FUNDED TO

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:45.987
CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS.

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:47.355
TOWARDS THINGS THAT WERE

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.256
DELINEATED EARLIER RESEARCH RE

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:50.891
HIRING STAFF --

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.393
LENGTHENING HOURS OF OPERATIONS

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.327
THOSE SORT OF THINGS WE HAVE

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:55.696
SOME MODEST MOMENTUM WOULD LIKE

01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:56.230
TO SEE THAT CONTINUE TO GO

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:58.132
FORWARD. ONE THING THAT'S REALLY

01:33:58.199 --> 01:33:59.166
MISSING IN THE TRIAL COURT

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:00.901
BUDGET THAT IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER

01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:02.503
BUDGETS IS THAT THE TRIAL COURT

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:04.972
BUDGET DOES NOT HAVE A COLA

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.607
MECHANISM. FOR COST OF DOING

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:08.042
BUSINESS ADJUSTMENT TO IT.

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:10.177
SO THEIR BUDGET IS HELD FLAT

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:12.546
EACH YEAR UNLESS YOU ALLOCATE

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:14.081
ANY MONEY SO THERE'S NO LIKE I

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:15.282
SAID NO COLA.

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:17.451
SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY PROGRAMS

01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:19.053
EVERY OTHER PROGRAM HAS AT TRIAL

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.588
COURTS A TRUST FUND DID HAVE

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:21.856
THAT FUND --

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:22.656
AND IT WAS A STRAIGHT

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:24.125
APPROPRIATION LIMIT --

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:29.130
ADJUSTMENT TO IT IT PREVIOUSLY

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:29.930
IT'S TIME TO REINSTATE THAT

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:30.598
MONEY.

01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:32.333
I'M SO THE COURTS CAN PREDICT

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.168
FROM YEAR TO YEAR WHAT MODEST

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:35.169
GROWTH THEY MAY HAVE IT ALSO

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:36.570
GIVES THEM AN ABILITY TO

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:37.571
COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN WITH THEIR

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:38.572
EMPLOYEES WHICH IS ALSO

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:40.908
DIFFICULT FOR COURTS WHEN

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:41.542
THEY'RE OPERATING AND FIND A POT

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:43.611
OF MONEY --

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:45.146
WITH REGARD TO COURT REPORTERS

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:46.647
SINCE LAST YEAR'S MODEST

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:48.382
ALLOCATION OUR OUR LEGISLATIVE

01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:49.550
INTENT TO SPEND TEN MILLION

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:52.019
DOLLARS TO HIRE FAMILY LAW COURT

01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:53.754
I'M TWO CASES WERE --

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:54.989
WERE DECIDED SOMEONE MENTIONED

01:34:55.056 --> 01:34:56.424
JAMISON --

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:58.759
THE DESTA WHICH ADDRESS INDIGENT

01:34:58.826 --> 01:34:59.627
LITIGANTS.

01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:01.128
BEING ENTITLED TO THE SAME

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:02.696
RESOURCES AS ANOTHER INTO.

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:04.999
INDIVIDUAL THE OTHER CASE WAS DO

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:06.901
CAN BE COMANCHE HILLS THAT

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:08.669
STATED THAT THE REPORTER SHALL

01:35:08.736 --> 01:35:09.837
BE REQUIRED --

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:12.573
PROVIDED FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS --

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.009
SO WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:17.211
DEMAND IN THE REQUIREMENTS IS

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:19.513
THERE IS EVEN GREATER NOW THAN

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.881
IT WAS LAST YEAR AND THE COURT

01:35:20.948 --> 01:35:21.082
HAS.

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:22.583
COURTS HAVE SPOKEN TO THAT

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:24.485
MATTER -- AS

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.220
MENTIONED THE COURT REPORTER

01:35:26.287 --> 01:35:28.222
TRANSCRIPT RATE IS THIRTY YEARS

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:29.790
OUTSTANDING AND WE WOULD ALSO

01:35:29.857 --> 01:35:31.125
ASK FOR A MODEST INCREASE WITH

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:32.626
THAT -- THE

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:33.994
RESERVES ARE VERY RESTRICTIVE

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:35.796
AND IT'S HARD FOR TRIAL COURTS

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:38.132
OPERATE WITH THAT 1% RESERVE CAP

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.266
SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME

01:35:39.333 --> 01:35:40.835
ADJUSTMENT TO THAT --

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:42.570
WE ARE SUPPORTED OF FUNDING FOR

01:35:42.636 --> 01:35:43.571
DEPENDENTS TO COUNSEL WE THINK

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:45.372
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT --

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:46.941
THE JUDGESHIPS IT'S VERY

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:48.309
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE JUDGE

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:51.112
THAT SHIP AMOUNTS COMES WITH.

01:35:51.178 --> 01:35:53.747
FUNDING FOR STAFF BUT IT'S NOT

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:55.449
ALWAYS ALLOCATED IN THAT WAY WE

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:57.017
THINK IT MUST BE USED IN THAT

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:57.718
WAY.

01:35:57.785 --> 01:35:59.787
I'M ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE ALL

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:01.655
THIS DEMAND FOR COURT REPORTERS --

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:02.256
THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

01:36:02.323 --> 01:36:04.058
SAN DIEGO SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:05.593
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE --

01:36:05.659 --> 01:36:07.828
IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THERE ARE

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:08.329
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THREE

01:36:08.395 --> 01:36:10.231
LICENSED COURT REPORTERS OVER

01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:11.298
SIX THOUSAND LICENSE REPORTERS

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:12.533
IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.568
APPROXIMATELY TWELVE TO FOURTEEN

01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:15.870
HUNDRED JUDGES STATEWIDE.

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:16.637
THERE'S A LOT OF COURT REPORTERS

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:19.707
OUT THERE THERE ARE THOSE JOBS I

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.041
WOULD SAY PART OF THE PROBLEM IS

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.076
NOT NECESSARILY A SHORTAGE

01:36:22.143 --> 01:36:23.410
PROBLEM BUT A RECRUITMENT

01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:25.112
PROBLEM. FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN

01:36:25.179 --> 01:36:27.314
DIEGO COUNTY THE STARTING WAGE

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.083
IS EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.651
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:32.653
PREVIOUSLY NOT SERVED.

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.787
AS AN OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

01:36:33.854 --> 01:36:35.022
SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE COURT

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:35.823
BUT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN A

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:37.158
FREELANCE COURT REPORTER FOR

01:36:37.224 --> 01:36:38.359
TWENTY YEARS.

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:39.827
THE SAME STARTING WAGE FOR THAT

01:36:39.894 --> 01:36:41.529
SAME INDIVIDUAL IN RIVERSIDE AND

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:42.363
SAN DIEGO --

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:44.398
RIVERSIDE IN ORANGE COUNTY IS

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:46.066
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED EIGHT

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:47.201
THOUSAND THAT'S MORE DESIRABLE

01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:48.569
TO LIVE AND WORK IN RIVERSIDE.

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:51.539
CHEAPER COSTS OF CHEAPER COST OF

01:36:51.605 --> 01:36:52.907
LIVING HIGHER WAGE.

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.608
THE OTHER THING IN SAN DIEGO AS

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:56.110
SOMEONE MENTIONED IS ALL THE

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:57.478
FAMILY LAW CIVIL REPORTERS WERE

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:58.612
LET GO.

01:36:58.679 --> 01:36:59.980
SO WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH A

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:01.715
LOWER WAGE A HISTORY OF

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:03.884
TERMINATING STAFF DOESN'T BECOME

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:05.452
THE MOST DESIRABLE PLACE.

01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:07.421
ADDITIONALLY THE REPORT RECORD

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:08.923
REPORTERS REPORT TO ME.

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:11.091
THAT THE CORE IS ONLY PROVIDING

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.193
INDIVIDUALS IN MANY OF THESE

01:37:12.259 --> 01:37:15.262
PROCEEDINGS UPON REQUEST DESPITE

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:16.530
THE COURT SAYING THE REPORTER

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:17.765
MUST BE PROVIDED.

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.700
THE REPORTERS ALSO REPORT THAT

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:21.235
THEY ARE SITTING THERE WAITING

01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:23.470
TO BE ASSIGNED TO COURT ROOMS.

01:37:23.537 --> 01:37:24.605
AND WE'LL HAVE EIGHT TO TEN OF

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:25.606
THEM SITTING THERE BUT THEY'RE

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:26.707
NOT BEING ASSIGNED AN

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:28.909
INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GETTING A

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:30.945
RECORD -- SO

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:33.447
AGAIN I WOULD SAY IT'S A A

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:34.848
RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS SOME PLACES

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:36.283
I ALSO WANT TO SAY IN DEFENSE OF

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:39.119
SAN DIEGO AND OTHER COURTS LIKE

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:40.654
DIFFICULTY RECRUITING.

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:42.089
IS IT THOSE COURTS WERE DONOR

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:44.358
COURTS UNDER THE THE MODEL SO

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:46.327
THEY WERE NOT.

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:47.761
ENJOYING THE SAME AMOUNTS OF

01:37:47.828 --> 01:37:49.697
INCREASES OTHER COURTS SO THEY

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.365
MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN HALF IN

01:37:51.432 --> 01:37:53.167
BRINGING UP THOSE WAGES TO BE

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:54.935
COMPETITIVE TO RECRUIT PEOPLE.

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:56.237
SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE

01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:57.137
PART THAT COULD BE PART OF THE

01:37:57.204 --> 01:37:58.405
PROBLEM --

01:37:58.472 --> 01:37:59.506
MISTER MOORE LIKE ELECTRONIC

01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:01.242
RECORDING AND VIDEO REPORTING IS

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:03.043
NOT A VERBATIM RECORD IN

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.211
CALIFORNIA ARE STANDARD FOR

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.880
TRANSCRIPTS IS A VERBATIM RECORD

01:38:06.947 --> 01:38:07.414
FOR NUMBER OF REASONS AND

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:08.549
AUDIBLES --

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:10.084
VOICES GET LOST SOME MACHINES

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:11.252
CAN'T --

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:13.821
PICK UP FEMALE VOICES WHICH

01:38:13.887 --> 01:38:15.823
PRIVILEGED CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:19.026
A LAWYER AND A CLIENT --

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:21.895
AND IT'S EXPENSIVE TO TRANSCRIBE --

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:25.366
ACCORDING TO A TRANSCRIPT.

01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:26.634
MR RODDY MENTIONED THAT THE

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.602
STATE LEGISLATURE DID IT DO A

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:30.371
PILOT OF ELECTRONIC RECORDING.

01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:32.339
AND WHAT THAT YIELDED WAS A

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:34.141
STATUTE THAT IS IN PLACE NOW

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:36.510
THAT THE RECORDINGS WERE SO

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:38.712
INCONSISTENT THAT THEY SHOULD

01:38:38.779 --> 01:38:40.180
NOT BE USED FOR THE MOST --

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:42.249
IMPORTANT TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:43.984
ADDITIONALLY I'VE FOUND THAT ONE

01:38:44.051 --> 01:38:45.519
PERSON THE COURT REPORTER WAS

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:47.054
THEN REPLACED BY FOUR PEOPLE.

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:48.756
BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:50.824
REMEMBER IS THAT THE COURT

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:51.692
REPORTER HANDLES ADMINISTRATION.

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:53.827
OF ALL THE TRANSCRIPTS THE

01:38:53.894 --> 01:38:55.362
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CLIENTS

01:38:55.429 --> 01:38:56.864
AND THE AND OTHER WERE ON THE

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:58.232
COURT ABOUT.

01:38:58.299 --> 01:38:59.033
GIVING TRANSCRIPTS OUT

01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:01.268
MAINTAINING TRANSCRIPTS SO YOU

01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:02.603
ALSO THEN SO THE COURT REPORTER

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:04.138
WENT AWAY BUT YOU HAD SOMEONE

01:39:04.204 --> 01:39:05.706
MONITORING EQUIPMENT THE HOW TO

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:06.874
E. R. MONITOR.

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.642
YOUR SUPERVISOR GOT TO BRING IN

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:10.678
ADDITIONAL CLERKS TO MANAGE THE

01:39:10.744 --> 01:39:12.212
TRANSCRIPTS --

01:39:12.279 --> 01:39:13.647
COLLECTING FEES FROM INDIVIDUALS

01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:14.948
AND TRANSCRIPTS BECAUSE THAT'S

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:16.717
ALL DONE BY THE COURT REPORTER

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.319
OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC'S COST.

01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:19.353
SO WE THINK THAT THE COURT

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:21.155
REPORTER IS HIGHLY EFFICIENT FOR

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:22.756
THE PUBLIC YOU'RE CERTAINLY THE

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.191
GOLD STANDARD --

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:26.727
AND ENSURES THAT EVERY INDIGENT.

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:28.395
INDIVIDUAL ACTUALLY GETS A

01:39:28.462 --> 01:39:30.798
TRANSCRIPT WITH REGARD TO

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:34.568
INDIGENT LEADING.

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.270
THEY DON'T GET A TRANSCRIPT THEY

01:39:36.337 --> 01:39:38.339
GET A DESK WITH THE RECORDING OF

01:39:38.405 --> 01:39:39.773
THE PROCEEDINGS FROM THE ENTIRE

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.775
DAY AND THEN THEY HAVE TO GO OUT

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:43.143
INTO THE FREE MARKET AND FIND

01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:44.345
SOMEBODY TO TRANSCRIBE THAT FOR

01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:44.678
THEM.

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:45.312
THAT'S A VERY VERY EXPENSIVE I

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:47.848
PROBABLY COULD.

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:49.016
SO WE THINK THE COURT REPORTER

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:50.451
IS A GOLD STANDARD BECAUSE IT'S

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:51.485
BEEN PROVEN.

01:39:51.552 --> 01:39:52.419
WE'VE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:53.887
ELECTRONIC RECORDING NVIDIA

01:39:53.954 --> 01:39:56.190
REPORTING AND THEY DON'T WORK.

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:57.658
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS ALL

01:39:57.725 --> 01:39:59.626
GETS DOWN TO FUNDING I'M SURE OF

01:39:59.693 --> 01:40:01.128
MISTER RODDY HAD MORE MONEY HE

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:02.863
COULD PROBABLY HIGHER HAVE A

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:04.031
MORE COMPETITIVE WAGE.

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:06.233
ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE AND I'M SURE

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.067
THAT'S WHAT OF COURSE WOULD WANT

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:09.269
BUT IT'S REALLY HARD BECAUSE NO

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:10.404
ONE REALLY WANTS TO ADEQUATELY

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:12.139
FUND THE SYSTEM OR EVEN GIVE

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:13.741
THEM THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS

01:40:13.807 --> 01:40:15.042
TO THEIR BUDGETS WITH THE COLA.

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:16.744
SO WITH THAT --

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:21.115
AND THANK YOU.

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:22.549
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF MANY BY

01:40:22.616 --> 01:40:23.550
NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN

01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:24.551
FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:26.086
MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES I THINK --

01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:27.221
MY COLLEAGUES --

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:28.722
AND OUR MEMBERS I HAVE DONE A

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:29.957
PHENOMENAL JOB --

01:40:30.023 --> 01:40:31.625
KIND OF DESCRIBING WHAT THE

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:32.626

OVER THE PAST DECADE A LONGER US

01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:57.651
IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

WANT TO PURSUE THE PROFESSION SO

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:46.733
I THINK THIS IS PRECISELY TOM

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.835
ADDRESS.

01:41:47.901 --> 01:41:50.103

01:42:02.382 --> 01:42:03.917
SHORTAGE --

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:05.452

POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT

01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:13.126
TARGETING A RE INVESTMENTS WE'VE

01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:14.561
BEEN DOING THAT FOR A NUMBER OF

01:42:14.628 --> 01:42:15.429
YEARS AND THIS COMMITTEE WHAT

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:16.230
WE'VE BEEN.

ACCESS TO JUSTICE WE KNOW WE

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:22.035

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:45.759
LOOK AT OUR POSITIONS LIKE THIS

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:46.894
IN OUR COURT TO HAVE BEEN

COURSE IN FUNDING.

01:42:55.869 --> 01:42:57.404
HI ELEMENT AND IN THE FINAL

01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:59.506
POINT I'D RACES JUST TO SUPPORT

THE ARGUMENT ABOUT --

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:02.242

SECONDLY --

01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:04.825
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A DIRECT

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:06.526

THE REQUESTED AMOUNT WE DO

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:07.414
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.748
ADOPTS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:11.017
LANGUAGE IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:48:11.084 --> 01:48:12.319
ON THE FIRST SET OF RECOMMENDED

01:48:12.385 --> 01:48:13.854
LANGUAGE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.022
JUDICIAL BRANCH REPORT NO LATER

01:48:16.089 --> 01:48:18.825
THAN JANUARY FIRST.

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:19.426
TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON HOW THE

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:20.193
DEFERRED BAT --

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.995
BACKLOG HAS CHANGED --

01:48:22.062 --> 01:48:23.730
TO THE EXTENT THE BACKLOG ROSE

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:24.865
THE LANGUAGE REQUIRE THEM TO

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:26.967
REPORT ON THE REASONS FOR THAT

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:28.668
GROWTH AND WHAT STEPS ARE BEING

01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:29.903
TAKEN TO ADDRESS IT.

01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:31.104
AND THIS WILL REALLY HELP THE

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:34.007
LEGISLATURE MONITOR THE ACTUAL

01:48:34.074 --> 01:48:35.375
ROUTINE ACTIVITY MAINTENANCE

ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON

01:48:36.743 --> 01:48:38.044
AGAINST ACTUAL NEED.

01:48:38.111 --> 01:48:39.512
AND DETERMINE WHAT ACTIONS IF

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:42.315
ANY NEED TO BE MADE ON AN

01:48:42.382 --> 01:48:43.216
ONGOING BASIS.

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:44.284
THE SECOND SET OF LANGUAGE WOULD

01:48:44.351 --> 01:48:45.051
REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:46.820
FINANCE TO REPORT NO LATER THAN

01:48:46.887 --> 01:48:49.256

TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON THE

01:48:49.856 --> 01:48:50.957
ACTUAL PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:48:51.024 --> 01:48:52.392
SUPPORTED USING THIS MONEY AND

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:53.426
THIS WILL HELP THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:53.493 --> 01:48:54.961
ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE USED

01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:56.596
ACCOUNT OF LEE AND CONSISTENT

01:48:56.663 --> 01:49:00.767
WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES --

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:02.002

FUNDS THAT YOU HAVE.

01:49:07.574 --> 01:49:09.776
AND ONE OF THE ONES I WAS

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:11.311
QUESTIONING WAS THOUGH.

01:49:11.378 --> 01:49:12.412
THE COURT FACILITIES

01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:14.180
CONSTRUCTION FUN WHERE YOU'RE

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:15.949
DRAWING DOWN SO.

01:49:16.016 --> 01:49:18.718
FUNDS FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS

01:49:18.785 --> 01:49:19.019
[inaudible]

01:49:19.085 --> 01:49:25.759
AND IT SAYS THAT THE IT'S GOING

01:49:25.825 --> 01:49:28.228
TO CONTINUE AT A CERTAIN LEVEL

01:49:28.295 --> 01:49:29.562
FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS

01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:31.598
THAT'S GONNA DROP.

01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:33.733
AND WHAT IS THE I ALSO.

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:35.869
HOW HOW DO YOU --

01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:38.371
THE TERM IN.

01:49:38.438 --> 01:49:41.942
ABOUT THAT BUT PLAN TO YOU. ONE

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:43.476
OF THE RESPONSE SO YOU CAN YOU

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:44.945
GIVE ME THE IDEA WHERE THE MONEY

01:49:45.011 --> 01:49:45.812
COMES.

01:49:45.879 --> 01:49:47.347
IT'S LIKE GOING OVER THE

01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:49.349
DIFFERENT FUNDS IN TERMS OF THE

01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:52.018
INSTANT CENTER FROM ADDED THE

01:49:52.085 --> 01:49:54.321
SCS YOU HAVE TO STATE COURT.

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:56.356
SO THIS CONSTRUCTION FUND --

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:57.023
THAT --

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:58.391
FUNDING THOSE LEVELS WERE

01:49:58.458 --> 01:49:59.693
PURSUANT TO A BUDGET CHANGE

01:49:59.759 --> 01:50:00.860
PROPOSAL THAT WAS SUBMITTED AND

01:50:00.927 --> 01:50:02.796
SO IS A MULTI YEAR ASPECT OF IT

01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:05.398
IN TERMS OF THAT FUNDING AND SO

01:50:05.465 --> 01:50:07.934
THAT WAS WHAT WAS OR IS THE

01:50:08.001 --> 01:50:09.135
BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL.

01:50:09.202 --> 01:50:10.470
I KNOW I WOULD SAY IS THAT IN

01:50:10.537 --> 01:50:11.972
THE PAST WE'VE REQUESTED A

01:50:12.038 --> 01:50:13.540
GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:15.041
SUPPORT OUR PROGRAMS.

01:50:15.108 --> 01:50:16.343
BUT GIVEN THE THE FISCAL

01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:17.711
CONSTRAINTS OF THE STATE THE THE

01:50:17.777 --> 01:50:19.112
APPROVALS WERE OUT OF THESE

01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:20.780

01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:22.349
THESE REVENUES BOTH IN THE

01:50:22.415 --> 01:50:24.117
MEDIANCRITICAL NEED ACCOUNT AND

01:50:24.184 --> 01:50:26.686

CIVIL FILING FEES --

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:31.992
AND SO THEY'RE NOT STATE GENERAL

01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:33.560
FUND RESOURCES THEY ARE IN

01:50:33.626 --> 01:50:35.462
EFFECT TO THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGING

01:50:35.528 --> 01:50:36.930

AS THE CASE MAY BE --

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:45.005
AND SO WE HAVE SPECIFIC

FOR THESE DIFFERENT NEEDS

01:50:47.407 --> 01:50:49.042
BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT --

01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.809
EXPENDITURES FOR EXAMPLE FROM

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:34.440
[inaudible]

01:58:34.507 --> 01:58:35.475
CERTAINLY [inaudible]

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:40.413
RIGHT -- GO

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:42.048
AHEAD CENTER.

01:58:42.114 --> 01:58:44.116
IF YOU BUILD A NEW BUILDING IS

01:58:44.183 --> 01:58:46.319
THAT A THAT THE PROBABLY

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:48.621
WOULDN'T BECAUSE AT STAKE IS

01:58:48.688 --> 01:58:51.457
THAT RIGHT RIGHT.

01:58:51.524 --> 01:58:52.625
SO YOU'RE REALLY CREATING A

01:58:52.692 --> 01:58:55.394
BRAND NEW.

01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:56.929
IN CENTER TO THE EXTENT THAT.

01:58:56.996 --> 01:58:58.664
YOU COURTHOUSE WOULD PLACE ONE

01:58:58.731 --> 01:59:01.367
ARM OLD AGING COURTHOUSES THEN

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:02.201
THAT.

01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:03.269
WOULD COME OFF THE BOOKS SO WHEN

01:59:03.336 --> 01:59:06.239
YOU CALCULATE THE DEFERRED

01:59:06.305 --> 01:59:06.539
MAINTENANCE.

01:59:06.606 --> 01:59:07.507
TRACK THE ARE YOU REDUCE THE

01:59:07.573 --> 01:59:09.442
COST BY.

01:59:09.509 --> 01:59:11.644
FACT THE FACILITY.

01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:13.479
OF THIS FREEDOM MAY NOT.

01:59:13.546 --> 01:59:15.314
THAT'S CORRECT WE WOULD TAKE OLD

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:16.716
BUILDING OUT OF THE OUT OF THE

01:59:16.782 --> 01:59:18.751
SYSTEM.

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:20.820
FOLLOWING UP ON THAT WHAT YOU

01:59:20.887 --> 01:59:22.522
MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO US TO KNOW I

01:59:22.588 --> 01:59:24.357
MEAN GIVEN THAT THERE ARE.

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:26.292
I'M SURE THEY'RE ALREADY PLANS

01:59:26.359 --> 01:59:30.229
IN SOME JURISDICTIONS.

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:31.831
TO I'M I KNOW IT'S NOT A LOT BUT

01:59:31.898 --> 01:59:33.799
TO BUILD NEW COURTHOUSES OR TO

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:34.834
ACQUIRE [inaudible]

01:59:34.901 --> 01:59:37.970
I'M.

01:59:38.037 --> 01:59:39.372
WE COULD HAVE SOME SENSE OF HOW

01:59:39.438 --> 01:59:40.606
THAT WOULD AFFECT THAT BACKLOG

01:59:40.673 --> 01:59:41.607
BECAUSE IF WE'RE JUST READING

01:59:41.674 --> 01:59:43.242
THIS BACKLOG IS SOMETHING WE

01:59:43.309 --> 01:59:45.945
MUST FUND VERSUS SOMETHING THAT.

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:48.548
WOULD BE REDUCED WHEN.

01:59:48.614 --> 01:59:51.651
A NEW COURT.

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:52.685
BUILDING WAS --

01:59:52.752 --> 01:59:54.453
PROCEEDED WITH WHICH MAY ALREADY

01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:56.889
BE PLANNED.

01:59:56.956 --> 02:00:00.192
FOR THAT HELPS US IN TERMS OF

02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:01.761
CALCULATING THOSE TYPES OF

02:00:01.827 --> 02:00:03.729
DECISIONS.

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:05.765

I AM NOT SURE BECAUSE MOST OF

02:07:44.223 --> 02:07:45.457
THE MONEY.

02:07:45.524 --> 02:07:48.260
AND MOST OF THE CASES ARE IN

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:49.928
LARGE URBAN AREAS.

02:07:49.995 --> 02:07:51.463
AND I THINK THAT --

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:54.633
AND THERE'S SERVED BY LARGER

02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:57.536
STREAM WE COMPETENT FIRMS.

02:07:57.603 --> 02:07:59.738
SO I REALLY THINK THAT THE POPE

02:07:59.805 --> 02:08:04.610
WOULD BE VERY FAST.

02:08:04.676 --> 02:08:08.747
ALL RIGHT BEFORE I ASK FOR

02:08:08.814 --> 02:08:10.315
PUBLIC COMMENT ARE THERE ANY

02:08:10.382 --> 02:08:12.284
OTHER QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS

02:08:12.351 --> 02:08:13.318
WANT TO MAKE ON THIS

02:08:13.385 --> 02:08:13.619
[inaudible]

02:08:13.685 --> 02:08:14.586
OKAY [inaudible]

02:08:14.653 --> 02:08:19.725
I'M.

02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:21.226
I'M SURE IF I MAY ASK HER YOU

02:08:21.293 --> 02:08:22.127
FINANCE --

02:08:22.194 --> 02:08:23.462
AMAZON OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:24.963
I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT --

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:26.298
THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS

02:08:26.365 --> 02:08:27.266
THE IMPORTANCE OF FUNDING

02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:29.168
DEPENDENCY COUNCIL WHICH IS BY

02:08:29.234 --> 02:08:30.769
THE BUDGET INCLUDES A TWO ON

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:33.138
GOING TWENTY MILLION INVESTMENT --

02:08:33.205 --> 02:08:34.973
IN THE QUARTER POINT IN THESE

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.542
ATTORNEYS --

02:08:36.608 --> 02:08:38.210
I DO WANT TO KNOW --

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:39.611
YOU KNOW IN DECEMBER WE RECENTLY

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:40.712
FOUND OUT THAT DEPENDENCY

02:08:40.779 --> 02:08:43.282
COUNCILS ELIGIBLE FOR TITLE

02:08:43.348 --> 02:08:44.116
FORTY FUNDING --

02:08:44.183 --> 02:08:45.451
AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

02:08:45.517 --> 02:08:46.718
SERVICES AS WELL AS THE JUDICIAL

02:08:46.785 --> 02:08:47.953
COUNCIL HAS BEEN WORKING

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:51.924
TOGETHER. TO MAKE SURE THE STATE

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:54.393
CAN.

02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:56.128
I AND YOU KNOW THIS FUNDING CAN

02:08:56.195 --> 02:08:57.763
HELP REIMBURSE 50% OF

02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:59.098
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR

02:08:59.164 --> 02:09:00.199
ATTORNEYS --

02:09:00.265 --> 02:09:01.166
AND SO WE'RE HOPING THAT CAN

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:03.202
HELP SUPPLEMENT OUR INVESTMENT

02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:06.839
IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

02:09:06.905 --> 02:09:08.540
WELL WHEN WE MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:09.875
THAT THERE MAY BE SOME ISSUES AS

02:09:09.942 --> 02:09:11.143
TO WHETHER THAT FEDERAL FUNDING

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:14.046
WOULD BE. TO BRING US UP TO SAY

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:16.048
THE FULL FIFTY MILLION

02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:17.850
AUGMENTATION.

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:20.219
SO IN OTHER WORDS THE ADDITIONAL.

02:09:20.285 --> 02:09:22.054
TWENTY FROM THE TWENTY MILLION

02:09:22.121 --> 02:09:23.322
YOU'RE RECOMMENDING ON GOING.

02:09:23.388 --> 02:09:27.159
ON AND SO WHEN WE RIGHT NOW

02:09:27.226 --> 02:09:28.961
WE'RE HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN BUT

02:09:29.027 --> 02:09:30.929
WHEN WE REVISIT IT IF THERE

02:09:30.996 --> 02:09:34.500
COULD BE A LITTLE MORE --

02:09:34.566 --> 02:09:36.068
WE CAN GET MORE INFORMATION

02:09:36.135 --> 02:09:37.035
ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MORE

02:09:37.102 --> 02:09:40.072
ASSESSMENT AS TO HOW MUCH WE CAN.

02:09:40.139 --> 02:09:42.941
A POTENTIALLY RELY ON THAT

02:09:43.008 --> 02:09:43.242
[inaudible]

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:43.942
WELL THERE [inaudible]

02:09:44.009 --> 02:09:46.645
OKAY.

02:09:46.712 --> 02:09:47.412
ALL RIGHT --

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:55.087
PUBLIC COMMENT.

ACKNOWLEDGING AND APPRECIATING

02:10:02.327 --> 02:10:03.328
THE TWENTY MILLION THAT WAS PUT

02:10:03.395 --> 02:10:05.130
INTO THE JANUARY BUDGET AS WELL

02:10:05.197 --> 02:10:06.231
AS THE PREVIOUS.

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:07.065
INCREASES --

02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:09.635
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY

02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:10.536
SEVENTEEN BUT ALSO WANT TO

02:10:10.602 --> 02:10:12.704
REITERATE AS THE AS MADAME CHAIR

02:10:12.771 --> 02:10:14.006
AS YOU NOTED THAT.

02:10:14.072 --> 02:10:15.274
IN TODAY AND IS IS NOTED IN

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:16.808
TODAY'S ANALYSIS THAT UNTIL WE

02:10:16.875 --> 02:10:18.410
REACH THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:19.912
MILLION THAT WAS RECOMMENDED

02:10:19.978 --> 02:10:21.380
BASED ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

02:10:21.446 --> 02:10:22.281
FORMULA.

02:10:22.347 --> 02:10:24.550
WE CONTINUE TO BE SEVERELY

02:10:24.616 --> 02:10:26.752
UNDERSTAFFED WITH AND I CARRY

02:10:26.818 --> 02:10:28.120
VERY IGH CASELOADS AND WOULD

02:10:28.187 --> 02:10:30.222
ALSO NOTE THAT THE HUNDRED AND

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:31.557
FORTY ONE CLIENTS PER ATTORNEY

02:10:31.623 --> 02:10:35.093
WE SEE IT AS I'M NOT AS A GOLD

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:38.297
STANDARD OR OR AS THE DESIRED

02:10:38.363 --> 02:10:39.364
CASELOAD --

02:10:39.431 --> 02:10:40.599
BUT IT'S CONSIDERED TO BE THE

02:10:40.666 --> 02:10:42.201
MAXIMUM THAT ONE ATTORNEY CAN

02:10:42.267 --> 02:10:44.203
MANAGE WITH --

02:10:44.269 --> 02:10:46.104
APPROPRIATE MULTI DISCIPLINARY

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:48.574
SUPPORT STAFF AND IT IS EXAMPLE

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.075
TO HELP YOU MAYBE THINK ABOUT

02:10:50.142 --> 02:10:51.243
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE.

02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:52.978
WE HAVE A GRANT FUNDED PROJECT

02:10:53.045 --> 02:10:54.546
WHERE WE SERVE SOME OF OUR MOST

02:10:54.613 --> 02:10:55.647
COMPLEX CLIENTS WHICH YOUR

02:10:55.714 --> 02:10:56.915
CHILDREN HAVE ALSO BEEN ARRESTED

02:10:56.982 --> 02:10:58.283
AND ARE INVOLVED WITH THE CHURCH

02:10:58.350 --> 02:11:00.319
THE DELINQUENCY COURT SYSTEM.

02:11:00.385 --> 02:11:03.121
AND WE STAFF THAT PROJECT WITH

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:06.258
SIX TWO ATTORNEYS AND FOR CASE

02:11:06.325 --> 02:11:09.127
MANAGERS WHO SERVE BETWEEN THEM

02:11:09.194 --> 02:11:10.662
SIXTY CLIENTS AT ANY GIVEN TIME

02:11:10.729 --> 02:11:12.831
OBVIOUSLY MUCH SMALLER RATIOS

02:11:12.898 --> 02:11:14.533
THAN WHAT OUR STATE FUNDING

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:16.101
COULD EVER ALLOW.

02:11:16.168 --> 02:11:17.336
FOR BUT AS A RESULT OF THAT

02:11:17.402 --> 02:11:18.770
INTENSITY OF THE INTENSIVE

02:11:18.837 --> 02:11:20.305
SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO

02:11:20.372 --> 02:11:21.607
THOSE CHILDREN WE HAVE VIRTUALLY

02:11:21.673 --> 02:11:22.975
ELIMINATED THE FOSTER CARE TO

02:11:23.041 --> 02:11:25.043
PRISON PIPELINE FOR THOSE SIXTY

02:11:25.110 --> 02:11:26.645
CHILDREN WE HAVE ONE CHILD IN

02:11:26.712 --> 02:11:28.247
THREE YEARS WHO WENT INTO ADULT.

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:29.381
THE INTO THE ADULT CRIMINAL

02:11:29.448 --> 02:11:30.415
JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH IS

02:11:30.482 --> 02:11:32.584
REMARKABLE WE THINK --

02:11:32.651 --> 02:11:33.685
IN ONLY TWO THAT FOUND

02:11:33.752 --> 02:11:35.654
THEMSELVES IN CAMPS 86%

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:37.522
COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL ARE THERE

02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:38.824
IN HIGH SCHOOL OR HAVE COMPLETED

02:11:38.890 --> 02:11:39.891
HIGH SCHOOL AND ALL OF THE

02:11:39.958 --> 02:11:41.226
GRADUATES ARE WORKING OR IN

02:11:41.293 --> 02:11:42.094
COLLEGE.

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:44.096
WHICH IS REMARKABLE AS I SAID

02:11:44.162 --> 02:11:45.030
FOR YOUTH WHO ARE DEEPLY

02:11:45.097 --> 02:11:45.964
INVOLVED WITH BOTH THE CHILD

02:11:46.031 --> 02:11:47.366
WELFARE AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

02:11:47.432 --> 02:11:48.267
SYSTEM.

02:11:48.333 --> 02:11:50.769
THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE LEARNED

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:53.372
IN THE PAST FIVE AND THAT WE ARE

02:11:53.438 --> 02:11:55.107
POISED TO IMPLEMENT IN ALL OF

02:11:55.173 --> 02:11:56.308
OUR PROGRAMS STATEWIDE --

02:11:56.375 --> 02:11:57.909
MANY OF HER PROGRAMS --

02:11:57.976 --> 02:11:59.711
BUT WE CAN'T WITHOUT ADDITIONAL

02:11:59.778 --> 02:12:01.446
STAFFING AND WITHOUT THE FUNDS

02:12:01.513 --> 02:12:02.814
TO NOT ONLY HIRE LAWYERS BUT TO

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:04.116
ALSO HIRED THE MULTI

02:12:04.182 --> 02:12:05.550
DISCIPLINARY STAFF THAT GO ALONG

02:12:05.617 --> 02:12:06.752
WITH THAT.

02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:07.853
I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS A

02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:09.021
COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT YOU

02:12:09.087 --> 02:12:10.689
RAISED DURING THE QUESTIONING --

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:12.257
THE FIRST BEING OVERALL NUMBERS

02:12:12.324 --> 02:12:13.859
AND WHILE WE AGREE THAT WE

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:15.560
GENERALLY HOWEVER AT A AT A

02:12:15.627 --> 02:12:17.296
STABLE CASELOAD THERE'S RESEARCH

02:12:17.362 --> 02:12:19.031
FROM THE CHILDREN'S DATA NETWORK

02:12:19.097 --> 02:12:19.998
AT USC --

02:12:20.065 --> 02:12:21.967
THAT PROJECTS IN ON A STEADY A

02:12:22.034 --> 02:12:23.635
SLOW BUT STEADY INCREASE IN THE

02:12:23.702 --> 02:12:25.237
CHILD WELFARE POPULATION.

02:12:25.304 --> 02:12:26.538
IN THE COMING YEARS --

02:12:26.605 --> 02:12:28.373
AND THAT'S BASED ON VERY COMPLEX

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:29.875
LONGITUDINAL STUDIES AND

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:31.610
ASSESSMENTS OF STATE DATA COUNTY

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:32.544
DATA.

02:12:32.611 --> 02:12:34.913
AND SO ON AND IS THE CHILDREN'S

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:37.482
DATA NETWORK IS AT USC AS I SAID

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:39.217
AND IS DEDICATED TO STUDYING

02:12:39.284 --> 02:12:41.253
CHILD WELFARE ON AND MAY HAVE

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:42.688
PUSHED PROVIDED SOME RESEARCH ON

02:12:42.754 --> 02:12:43.355
THAT.

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:45.290
WITH REGARD TO HIRING WELL WE

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:46.992
DON'T HAVE THE OVERALL SUPPLY

02:12:47.059 --> 02:12:48.327
PROBLEM THAT WE HEARD ABOUT

02:12:48.393 --> 02:12:49.861
EARLIER THERE ARE SOME POCKETS

02:12:49.928 --> 02:12:51.596
NORTHERN AND RURAL COUNTIES

02:12:51.663 --> 02:12:53.165
WHERE IT SOME WHERE A SINGLE

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:54.966
POSITION MAY REMAIN.

02:12:55.033 --> 02:12:56.435
VACANT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BUT

02:12:56.501 --> 02:13:00.205
WE SOLUTION TO THAT IN TERMS OF

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:01.640
THE BUDGET INCREASE BECAUSE THE

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:03.275
ISSUE IS NOT THAT THE ATTORNEYS

02:13:03.342 --> 02:13:05.143
DON'T EXIST BUT THE VAGUE THERE

02:13:05.210 --> 02:13:06.545
ARE WAGES ARE NOT COMPETITIVE.

02:13:06.611 --> 02:13:08.313
SO THE INCREASE AND THE WORK AND

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:10.048
THE PROSPECT OF TAKING ON AN

02:13:10.115 --> 02:13:11.350
OVERWHELMING CASELOAD SCARES

02:13:11.416 --> 02:13:13.552
PEOPLE AWAY WROTE REALISTICALLY.

02:13:13.618 --> 02:13:14.686
SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:15.954
AUGMENTATION --

02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:17.089
WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM

02:13:17.155 --> 02:13:18.590
SIGNIFICANTLY --

02:13:18.657 --> 02:13:20.158
WHEN MR WELL SPOKE ABOUT THE

02:13:20.225 --> 02:13:21.993
LARGE URBAN AREAS WHERE WE ARE

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:23.362
POISED TO GO I'M PRETTY SURE

02:13:23.428 --> 02:13:24.796
HOUZZ MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT MY

02:13:24.863 --> 02:13:26.098
ORGANIZATION --

02:13:26.164 --> 02:13:28.433
CLC REPRESENTS OVER ALMOST HALF

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:30.035
THE CHILDREN IN THE WHOLE STATE --

02:13:30.102 --> 02:13:32.571
AND WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:34.306
200- FULL TIME ATTORNEYS OVER

02:13:34.373 --> 02:13:35.640
FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY STAFF

02:13:35.707 --> 02:13:37.342
BETWEEN OUR THREE COUNTIES --

02:13:37.409 --> 02:13:39.411
AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY READY TO

02:13:39.478 --> 02:13:40.846
GO AND BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE

02:13:40.912 --> 02:13:42.147
IS I WOULD SAY IN THE PAST FEW

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:43.949
YEARS WE LEARNED VERY QUICKLY

02:13:44.015 --> 02:13:45.884
WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO WE HIRED --

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:48.286
CLOSE TO FORTY ATTORNEYS --

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:50.088
WITH THE RECENT INCREASES AS

02:13:50.155 --> 02:13:51.390
WELL AS SUPPORT STAFF TO GO

02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:52.791
ALONG WITH THAT AND WERE ABLE TO

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:54.092
CREATE OUR SPECIALIZED

02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:55.160
COLLABORATIVE UNIT.

02:13:55.227 --> 02:13:57.596
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF MIDDLE

02:13:57.662 --> 02:13:58.964
MANAGERS THAT ARE VERY READY TO

02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:00.265
MOVE UP IN A LOT OF SENIOR

02:14:00.332 --> 02:14:01.500
ATTORNEYS THAT ARE VERY READY

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:03.101
ALSO TO TAKE ON THOSE ADDITIONAL

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:04.436

02:27:26.571 --> 02:27:27.605
SO.

02:27:27.672 --> 02:27:29.574
IF IF PART OF OUR OBJECTIVE IN

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.742
THIS IS PART OF MY QUESTION IS

02:27:31.809 --> 02:27:33.144
WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE THIS PART

02:27:33.211 --> 02:27:34.912
OF OUR OBJECTIVE IS.

02:27:34.979 --> 02:27:38.082
TO BEGIN TO LAND ON THE MOST

02:27:38.149 --> 02:27:40.818
EFFECTIVE.

02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:43.854
PRE TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT --

02:27:43.921 --> 02:27:49.427
SO THAT IN THE YOU KNOW WE KNOW.

02:27:49.493 --> 02:27:51.095
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ITSELF

02:27:51.162 --> 02:27:53.130
ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED AS EARLY AS

02:27:53.197 --> 02:27:54.498
I THINK WAS TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:55.967
MIGHT'VE BEEN EARLIER.

02:27:56.033 --> 02:27:59.303
THAT -- OUR

02:27:59.370 --> 02:28:02.573
CURRENT SYSTEM OF OF BAIL WAS

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:04.408
DISCRIMINATORY ON THOSE WHO ARE

02:28:04.475 --> 02:28:07.311
LOW INCOME AND SO AND IT DOESN'T

02:28:07.378 --> 02:28:09.180
NECESSARILY.

02:28:09.247 --> 02:28:10.414
THAT ARE IF WE THINK ABOUT WHAT

02:28:10.481 --> 02:28:11.415
IS OUR PURPOSE OUR PURPOSE IS

02:28:11.482 --> 02:28:12.950
PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:28:13.017 --> 02:28:16.220
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THOSE --

02:28:16.287 --> 02:28:18.322
PEOPLE HAT ARE CHARGED WITH

02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:20.157
SOMETHING THAT ARE AT THAT WOULD

02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:22.860
MEAN MOST LIKELY.

02:28:22.927 --> 02:28:24.929
CONTINUE TO OFFEND OR BE A

02:28:24.996 --> 02:28:26.797
THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:28:26.864 --> 02:28:28.566
OURS ARE THAT WERE PROTECTED

02:28:28.633 --> 02:28:30.201
FROM THAT AND OTHERWISE THE

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:32.470
ASSUMPTION IS YOU ARE INNOCENT

02:28:32.536 --> 02:28:33.838
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

02:28:33.904 --> 02:28:36.073
SO IT SEEMS TO ME GIVEN THAT THE

02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:37.508
JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS YOU KNOW

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:38.943
ALREADY HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT

02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:40.411
THIS AND CLEARLY LOTS OF OUR

02:28:40.478 --> 02:28:41.746
COURTS HAVE.

02:28:41.812 --> 02:28:44.582
WHY WOULD WE BE NOW TRYING

02:28:44.649 --> 02:28:44.882
[inaudible]

02:28:44.949 --> 02:28:46.617
TO YOU ARE.

02:28:46.684 --> 02:28:48.386
IDENTIFY A I DON'T KNOW SOME

02:28:48.452 --> 02:28:49.654
NUMBER OF THESE COUNTIES OR

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:51.422
ALREADY ENGAGED IN SOME LEVEL OF

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:53.057
THIS ACTIVITY.

02:28:53.124 --> 02:28:54.292
AND THEN BE EVALUATING THEM SO

02:28:54.358 --> 02:28:56.060
THAT WE COULD.

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:58.329
YEAH SO YES THANK YOU THANK YOU

02:28:58.396 --> 02:29:00.464
MADAM CHAIR I'M THE CHIEF

02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:01.999
DESCRIBE THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM

02:29:02.066 --> 02:29:03.434
IS SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT YOU

02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:04.835
DID SHE SAID THAT IT WAS UNSAFE

02:29:04.902 --> 02:29:06.437
AND UNFAIR RIGHT SO IT'S AND IT

02:29:06.504 --> 02:29:08.039
DOESN'T WORK IN TERMS OF ALL IS

02:29:08.105 --> 02:29:09.073
NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS COULD BE.

02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:11.008
IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND

02:29:11.075 --> 02:29:13.010
IT'S UP POTENTIALLY COULD

02:29:13.077 --> 02:29:14.545
PENALIZED FOR PEOPLE FOR BEING

02:29:14.612 --> 02:29:16.147
POOR -- SO

02:29:16.213 --> 02:29:18.749
IN TERMS OF STUDYING THIS --

02:29:18.816 --> 02:29:21.319
WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING WELL

02:29:21.385 --> 02:29:23.120
FUNDED THE RECIDIVISM REDUCTION

02:29:23.187 --> 02:29:24.822
FUND SEVERAL YEARS AGO NOW AND

02:29:24.889 --> 02:29:26.257
BY THIS FALL WE ARE GOING TO BE

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:27.558
PROVIDING A REPORT TO THE

02:29:27.625 --> 02:29:28.659
LEGISLATURE.

02:29:28.726 --> 02:29:31.295
THAT LOOKS AT THOSE PROGRAMS

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:32.730
THAT WERE FROM --

02:29:32.797 --> 02:29:34.031
FUNDED BOTH FOR COLLABORATIVE

02:29:34.098 --> 02:29:36.100
WORDS AND FOR PRE TRIAL WE'VE

02:29:36.167 --> 02:29:37.535
ELEVEN PRE TRIAL PROGRAMS --

02:29:37.601 --> 02:29:39.303
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW

02:29:39.370 --> 02:29:43.307
OF DOING A MUCH DEEPER DIVE INTO --

02:29:43.374 --> 02:29:44.809
SIX OF TOSE PRE TRIAL PROGRAMS

02:29:44.875 --> 02:29:46.510
AND WHEN I SAY A DEEPER DIVE I

02:29:46.577 --> 02:29:48.979
MEAN WE ARE COLLECTING DATA FROM

02:29:49.046 --> 02:29:50.815
LOCAL JAILS WE ARE COLLECTING

02:29:50.881 --> 02:29:53.250
DATA FROM THE CAL DOJ AND WE'RE

02:29:53.317 --> 02:29:54.685
COLLECTING ADDITIONAL DATA FROM

02:29:54.752 --> 02:29:56.921
THE COURTS IN ORDER TO LOOK AT

02:29:56.987 --> 02:29:58.489
THOSE PROGRAMS --

02:29:58.556 --> 02:30:00.224
AND PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS VERSUS

02:30:00.291 --> 02:30:01.726
PEOPLE WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE

02:30:01.792 --> 02:30:03.027
IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND REALLY

02:30:03.094 --> 02:30:05.596
MEASURE BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY --

02:30:05.663 --> 02:30:07.698
AND RETURN TO COURT I THINK WHAT

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:09.433
IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE

02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:12.470
PROGRAMS AND THE OTHER --

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:13.104
FORTY SIX PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT

02:30:13.170 --> 02:30:14.739
THERE VERSUS WHAT IS BEING

02:30:14.805 --> 02:30:16.374
PROPOSED RIGHT NOW IS PART OF

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:17.775
THE BUDGET IS THIS IS A MUCH

02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:19.210
DEEPER DIVE --

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:20.711
WE ANTICIPATE WHAT --

02:30:20.778 --> 02:30:23.080
GOING INTO THIS COUNTY IS FAR

02:30:23.147 --> 02:30:24.882
MORE COMPREHENSIVE SEVENTY FIVE

02:30:24.949 --> 02:30:26.450
MILLION DOLLARS FOR EIGHT TO TEN

02:30:26.517 --> 02:30:28.185
PLACES IS IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:30:28.252 --> 02:30:29.854
AMOUNT OF MONEY AND AND WE THINK

02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:31.789
BECAUSE OF THAT.

02:30:31.856 --> 02:30:35.059
WE ENVISION PROGRAMS WHERE --

02:30:35.126 --> 02:30:38.629
ASSESS YOU KNOW P. ELIGIBLE FOR

02:30:38.696 --> 02:30:40.564
WILL BE WILL BE ASSESSED --

02:30:40.631 --> 02:30:42.199
IT WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:30:42.266 --> 02:30:43.334
TO DO -- A

02:30:43.401 --> 02:30:44.602
DEEPER DIVE ABOUT VALIDATION OF

02:30:44.668 --> 02:30:47.671
THOSE TOOLS YOU MENTION THE

02:30:47.738 --> 02:30:48.239
FORTY SIX FORTY SIX PROGRAMS

02:30:48.305 --> 02:30:49.907
THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

02:30:49.974 --> 02:30:51.208
WHERE WHERE TOOLS ARE BEING USED.

02:30:51.275 --> 02:30:52.743
I'M IN VERY FW HAVE THE TOOLS

02:30:52.810 --> 02:30:54.645
ACTUALLY BEEN VALIDATED ON THEIR

02:30:54.712 --> 02:30:56.747
LOCAL POPULATIONS AND SO PART OF

02:30:56.814 --> 02:30:58.349
THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO BE

02:30:58.416 --> 02:31:00.017
VALIDATING THOSE TOOLS --

02:31:00.084 --> 02:31:01.685
ANOTHER BIG ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

02:31:01.752 --> 02:31:03.220
RUN INTO --

02:31:03.287 --> 02:31:04.955
WITH WITH THAT WHAT I CAN THE

02:31:05.022 --> 02:31:05.890
BIG ISSUE THAT WE HAVE RUN INTO

02:31:05.956 --> 02:31:07.458
BUT ISSUE THAT OUR RECIDIVISM

02:31:07.525 --> 02:31:08.893
REDUCTION FUN COURTS HAVE

02:31:08.959 --> 02:31:10.161
IDENTIFIED IS.

02:31:10.227 --> 02:31:11.462
THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATION

02:31:11.529 --> 02:31:13.197
AND DATA EXCHANGE SO THIS

02:31:13.264 --> 02:31:15.733
PROGRAM IS ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE

02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:17.201
FOR A COLLABORATION AND HAVE

02:31:17.268 --> 02:31:18.269
OPERATION AMONG LOCAL JUSTICE

02:31:18.335 --> 02:31:19.603
SYSTEM PARTNERS.

02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:21.105
THROUGH DATA EXCHANGES AND WE

02:31:21.172 --> 02:31:23.107
ANTICIPATE THE DOLLARS WILL GO

02:31:23.174 --> 02:31:24.675
TO THE COURTS SO THAT PROVISION

02:31:24.742 --> 02:31:26.043
IN THE JAILS IN THE COURTS CAN

02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:27.344
CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER.

02:31:27.411 --> 02:31:28.846
HOW THAT INFORMATION SHARED AT

02:31:28.913 --> 02:31:30.648
THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THE DECISIONS

02:31:30.714 --> 02:31:32.416
CAN BE MADE MORE QUICKLY AND

02:31:32.483 --> 02:31:34.051
THEN THAT WILL ALSO ENABLE US AT

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:35.886
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL LEVEL TO GO

02:31:35.953 --> 02:31:38.088
IN AND PULL THAT DATA AND DO A

02:31:38.155 --> 02:31:39.690
DEEPER ANALYSIS AND WERE ABLE TO

02:31:39.757 --> 02:31:41.325
DO RIGHT NOW AS IT RELATES TO

02:31:41.392 --> 02:31:41.559
ISSUES?

02:31:41.625 --> 02:31:42.960
THAT I THINK ARE I KNOW ARE OF

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:44.261
GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE

02:31:44.328 --> 02:31:45.863
LEGISLATURE AND ALSO THE CHIEF

02:31:45.930 --> 02:31:46.530
JUSTICE AND AND THE

02:31:46.597 --> 02:31:48.065
ADMINISTRATION AROUND POTENTIAL

02:31:48.132 --> 02:31:49.467
BIAS IN THE TOOLS.

02:31:49.533 --> 02:31:50.835
BUT IF YOU DESCRIBE THAT YOU'RE

02:31:50.901 --> 02:31:52.803
GONNA BE DOING THIS DEEPER DIVE

02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:56.173
AND THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS THE

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:56.707
GRANT PROGRAM [inaudible]

02:31:56.774 --> 02:31:58.609
ARE YOU.

02:31:58.676 --> 02:31:59.910
ARE YOU GOING TO BE JUST

02:31:59.977 --> 02:32:01.545
ASSESSING [inaudible]

02:32:01.612 --> 02:32:03.380
THOSE TOOLS.

02:32:03.447 --> 02:32:04.915
THAT RISK ASSESSMENT THAT

02:32:04.982 --> 02:32:06.450
WHATEVER COUNTIES ARE AWARDED

02:32:06.517 --> 02:32:08.385
ARE ALREADY USING.

02:32:08.452 --> 02:32:10.554
OR DO YOU HAVE A OR YOUR IS

02:32:10.621 --> 02:32:12.823
THERE GOING TO BE RECOMMENDED AT

02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:13.424
A CERTAIN PART OF THE QUESTION

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:15.092
IS.

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:16.360
WE HAVEN'T REALLY VALUE WITH

02:32:16.427 --> 02:32:17.495
THESE TOOLS.

02:32:17.561 --> 02:32:19.196
AND MAYBE THERE HAS MAYBE THERE

02:32:19.263 --> 02:32:20.498
IS A BEST PRACTICE SOMEWHERE

02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:22.867
WOULD WE BE ASKING CERTAIN

02:32:22.933 --> 02:32:25.102
COURTS THAT WE FUNDED. TO

02:32:25.169 --> 02:32:26.904
UTILIZE TOOL EXOR TOOL WHY SO

02:32:26.971 --> 02:32:28.472
THAT WE COULD THEN COMPARE THE

02:32:28.539 --> 02:32:30.107
EFFECTIVENESS.

02:32:30.174 --> 02:32:33.811
OF TOOL EXOR TOOL WHY ME WHAT IS

02:32:33.878 --> 02:32:35.913
IT'S NOT CLEAR FROM THE FROM

02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:37.915
LATE YES SO SO A VARIETY OF

02:32:37.982 --> 02:32:39.250
COURTS --

02:32:39.316 --> 02:32:41.785
WILL BE WILL BE ONE OF THE SO

02:32:41.852 --> 02:32:43.354
WITH SIMILAR TO ARE THERE WHEN

02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:44.955
YOU SAVE RIGHT OF COURT SO

02:32:45.022 --> 02:32:45.523
MEANING WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY

02:32:45.589 --> 02:32:46.390
USING.

02:32:46.457 --> 02:32:47.458
I I MEAN A COUPLE DIFFERENT

02:32:47.525 --> 02:32:49.426
THINGS ONE IS IN PART DIFFERENCE

02:32:49.493 --> 02:32:50.995
CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS RIGHT SO

02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:52.296
DIFFERENT COURT CASE MANAGEMENT

02:32:52.363 --> 02:32:55.065
SYSTEM SO THAT ANYTHING THAT WE

02:32:55.132 --> 02:32:57.368
LEARN AND ANY --

02:32:57.434 --> 02:32:59.603
IN PLACE FOR A MAJOR COURT CASE

02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:00.738
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE CAN

02:33:00.804 --> 02:33:02.139
REPLICATE THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:33:02.206 --> 02:33:03.974
THAT'S ONE ANOTHER IS QUART SIZE

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:05.509
RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:33:05.576 --> 02:33:07.011
COURTS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY

02:33:07.077 --> 02:33:08.345
LARGE AND OTHER COURTS THAT ARE

02:33:08.412 --> 02:33:09.780
YOU KNOW TWO TO FIVE JUDGES IN

02:33:09.847 --> 02:33:11.048
THE STATE AND SO MAKING SURE

02:33:11.115 --> 02:33:11.649
THAT.

02:33:11.715 --> 02:33:12.383
WE HAVE A DIVERSITY OF THOSE

02:33:12.449 --> 02:33:14.552
COURTS LOOKING AT NORTHERN

02:33:14.618 --> 02:33:15.886
STATES.

02:33:15.953 --> 02:33:17.254
FAITH NORTHERN CHORDS SOUTHERN

02:33:17.321 --> 02:33:18.989
COURTS A COASTAL AND AND RURAL

ALSO SO LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF

02:33:20.724 --> 02:33:21.592
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT I

02:33:21.659 --> 02:33:24.261
ONLY SEE GOD SAY'S IT SO YES.

02:33:24.328 --> 02:33:26.163
WE HAVE GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES

02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:30.000
BUT DO WE ARE THOSE.

02:33:30.067 --> 02:33:31.669
ARE THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF

02:33:31.735 --> 02:33:33.237
THE COURTS AN INDICATOR OF

02:33:33.304 --> 02:33:34.371
WHETHER THEY'RE USING A

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:35.940
DIFFERENT RISK ASSESSMENT FREE

02:33:36.006 --> 02:33:37.041
TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL OR

02:33:37.107 --> 02:33:38.576
NOT OR SO I GUESS WHAT I'M

02:33:38.642 --> 02:33:40.044
REALLY TRYING TO GET AT YOU

02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:41.812
HAVEN'T MENTIONED YET IS.

02:33:41.879 --> 02:33:44.915
PART OF THIS PILOT IS.

02:33:44.982 --> 02:33:45.950
TO GIVE US BETTER INFORMATION

02:33:46.016 --> 02:33:48.652
ABOUT OUR PRE TRIAL RISK

02:33:48.719 --> 02:33:51.956
ASSESSMENT TOOLS SO ARE WE GOING

02:33:52.022 --> 02:33:53.090
TO BE.

02:33:53.157 --> 02:33:56.126
MEAN OR GONNA BE COMPARING.

02:33:56.193 --> 02:33:57.328
APPLE'S INCOME QUOTES AND

02:33:57.394 --> 02:34:01.832
PINEAPPLES OR SO ARE WE IS PART

02:34:01.899 --> 02:34:03.767
OF THE CRITERIA THAT.

02:34:03.834 --> 02:34:05.469
ALL OF THE PILOT.

02:34:05.536 --> 02:34:06.670
ALL USING DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT

02:34:06.737 --> 02:34:08.372
TOOL SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH

02:34:08.439 --> 02:34:09.540
MIGHT BE.

02:34:09.607 --> 02:34:11.542
THE MOST USEFUL OR ARE WE GOING

02:34:11.609 --> 02:34:13.043
TO BE RECOMMENDING CERTAIN

02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:15.379
ASSESSMENT TOOLS SO THAT THEN

02:34:15.446 --> 02:34:17.481
WERE EVALUATING WHETHER.

02:34:17.548 --> 02:34:20.417
IDENTIFIED ASSESSMENT TOOLS.

02:34:20.484 --> 02:34:22.152
IN YOU CELLS WERE SOMETHING YOU

02:34:22.219 --> 02:34:23.354
KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE THE BEST

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:24.822
PRACTICE OR NOT.

02:34:24.888 --> 02:34:27.658
YES SO LIGHT I UNDERSTAND --

02:34:27.725 --> 02:34:29.360
I SHOULD SAY THAT --

02:34:29.426 --> 02:34:31.261
THIS PRE TRIAL OF REFORM

02:34:31.328 --> 02:34:32.863
OPERATIONS WORKGROUP PROWESS OR

02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:34.398
CALLING IT IS IS THE GROUP THAT

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:35.733
REALLY IS DEVELOPING.

02:34:35.799 --> 02:34:37.067
THE APPLICATION AND THE AND THE

02:34:37.134 --> 02:34:38.569
CRITERIA BASED UPON THE THINGS

02:34:38.636 --> 02:34:40.237
THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE THE

02:34:40.304 --> 02:34:41.338
CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED

02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:41.605
TO DATE.

02:34:41.672 --> 02:34:44.274
HAVE HAVE DISCUSSED THE BENEFIT

02:34:44.341 --> 02:34:47.211
OF LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF TOOLS --

02:34:47.277 --> 02:34:48.278
THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE

02:34:48.345 --> 02:34:49.913
PROGRAM I SHOULD SAY THE ANOTHER

02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:51.281
PRIORITY OF THIS GROUP ANOTHER

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:52.816
CHARGE OF THE GROUP FROM THE

IS LOOKING AT I'VE INTO THESE

02:34:59.023 --> 02:35:00.424
TOOLS AS YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE

02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:01.625
MANY TOOLS THAT ARE BEING OUT

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:02.660
THERE NOT ONLY ARE THERE

02:35:02.726 --> 02:35:03.861
DIFFERENT TOOLS WITH THE TOOLS

02:35:03.927 --> 02:35:05.562
ARE ARE BEING MODIFIED IN

02:35:05.629 --> 02:35:06.697
DIFFERENT COUNTIES BECAUSE OF

02:35:06.764 --> 02:35:08.399
DIFFERENT COUNTY CULTURES.

02:35:08.465 --> 02:35:09.767
AND SO WHAT THAT GROUP IS DOING

02:35:09.833 --> 02:35:11.468
SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THE WORK THAT

02:35:11.535 --> 02:35:12.970
IT'S DOING AROUND THE SEVENTY

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:14.738
FIVE MILLION IS LOOKING AT THOSE

02:35:14.805 --> 02:35:17.207
TOOLS AND COMING UP I ANTICIPATE

02:35:17.274 --> 02:35:17.808
THAT THEY'LL BE COMING UP WITH

02:35:17.875 --> 02:35:19.576
THE SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR

02:35:19.643 --> 02:35:20.911
TRIAL COURTS TO CONSIDER WHEN

02:35:20.978 --> 02:35:22.079
THEY'RE ADOPTING THESE COOL

02:35:22.146 --> 02:35:23.180
TOOLS AND SO WHAT --

02:35:23.247 --> 02:35:24.782
THAT THEY WERE BEING ASKED --

02:35:24.848 --> 02:35:26.050
TO OKAY FUNNY BEFORE THAT'S

02:35:26.116 --> 02:35:27.785
BEFORE YOU REALLY WORKED THAT

02:35:27.851 --> 02:35:30.287
OUT BUT IT JUST COMMENT.

02:35:30.354 --> 02:35:33.057

I NOTE YOUR COMMENT ABOUT A

02:35:35.392 --> 02:35:38.562
DIFFERENT.

02:35:38.629 --> 02:35:40.564
NOT SURE IF YOU SAID.

02:35:40.631 --> 02:35:43.067
OR CULTURES ARE COUNTY CULTURES

02:35:43.133 --> 02:35:43.400
VERB.

02:35:43.467 --> 02:35:46.637
CLEARLY THERE IS --

02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:50.174
OBVIOUSLY VARIATIONS IN THE IN

02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:51.141
THE DEFENDANTS THAT ARE COMING

02:35:51.208 --> 02:35:53.711
FORWARD AND SAY REGION X. OR Y.

02:35:53.777 --> 02:35:57.047
THOUGH IF OUR OBJECTIVE.

02:35:57.114 --> 02:35:58.615
OUR PURPOSE FOR THIS.

02:35:58.682 --> 02:36:01.819
IS TO HELP US [inaudible]

02:36:01.885 --> 02:36:02.986
BETTER.

02:36:03.053 --> 02:36:05.255
UNDERSTAND EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR

02:36:05.322 --> 02:36:07.391
THE PUBLIC SAFETY OBJECTIVE OF

02:36:07.458 --> 02:36:10.894
OF SO MINIMIZING.

02:36:10.961 --> 02:36:13.363
MINIMIZING EITHER HOLDING PEOPLE

02:36:13.430 --> 02:36:15.165
ARE CHARGING THEM BAIL IF

02:36:15.232 --> 02:36:16.867
THEY'RE NOT.

02:36:16.934 --> 02:36:19.470
A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK.

02:36:19.536 --> 02:36:22.239
AND YES THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME

02:36:22.306 --> 02:36:27.411
FACTORS THAT ARE --

02:36:27.478 --> 02:36:29.880
NO MY TWO VAX VERY

02:36:29.947 --> 02:36:31.615
GEOGRAPHICALLY.

02:36:31.682 --> 02:36:32.883
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEE THAT

02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:35.152
THERE'S HUGE AMOUNT.

02:36:35.219 --> 02:36:36.587
OF FACTORS THAT ARE GONNA VERY

02:36:36.653 --> 02:36:38.255
GEOGRAPHICALLY THAT WHEN WE'RE

02:36:38.322 --> 02:36:39.857
GETTING RIGHT DO WHEN WE GET

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:41.892
DOWN TO THE BASIS OF OUR PRIMARY

02:36:41.959 --> 02:36:43.494
OBJECTIVE IS THAT ACHIEVING THE

02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:45.329
PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:36:45.395 --> 02:36:47.998
SO I GUESS WHERE I'M GOING IS

02:36:48.065 --> 02:36:50.968
WHAT YOU KNOW ARE WE IF I FIND A

02:36:51.034 --> 02:36:52.903
PILOT I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE ARE

02:36:52.970 --> 02:36:55.005
MORE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT

02:36:55.072 --> 02:36:56.573
WE'RE TRYING TO YOU BOTH WHAT

02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:58.041
THE CRITERIA IS OF WHAT WE WE

02:36:58.108 --> 02:36:59.176
HOW YOU VALUE IT HAD A FUNDED.

02:36:59.243 --> 02:37:00.677
WHAT'S OUR OBJECT WHAT ARE WE

02:37:00.744 --> 02:37:02.646
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.

02:37:02.713 --> 02:37:03.747
I I WOULD SAY THAT THE

02:37:03.814 --> 02:37:08.318
OBJECTIVES ARE THREEFOLD ONE IS --

02:37:08.385 --> 02:37:11.522
TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS-OF PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN IT COMES

02:37:11.588 --> 02:37:12.956
TO PRE TRIAL RELEASE RIGHTS WILL

02:37:13.023 --> 02:37:14.458
BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE AND

02:37:14.525 --> 02:37:15.659
MEASURING THAT.

02:37:15.726 --> 02:37:17.661
A SECOND IS RETURNED TO COURT

02:37:17.728 --> 02:37:19.196
AND TO HAVING SUCCESSFUL --

02:37:19.263 --> 02:37:21.165
IN TERMS OF RETURN TO COURT THAT

02:37:21.231 --> 02:37:22.432
THE DEFENDANTS COME TO COURT

02:37:22.499 --> 02:37:24.201
WHEN THE DEFENDANTS ARE REQUIRED.

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:25.903
TO MITIGATING BIAS IS ANOTHER

02:37:25.969 --> 02:37:27.538
OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IN SO

02:37:27.604 --> 02:37:29.740
DOING THAT LOOK AND SEEING IF

02:37:29.807 --> 02:37:30.741
THERE IS BIAS IN THE SYSTEM

02:37:30.808 --> 02:37:31.742
WHERE THERE IS BIAS IN THE

02:37:31.809 --> 02:37:33.177
SYSTEM AND HOW IT IS THAT THAT

02:37:33.243 --> 02:37:34.578
WE CAN WORK.

02:37:34.645 --> 02:37:35.746
TO REDUCE THAT BIAS ANOTHER

02:37:35.813 --> 02:37:38.816
ANOTHER YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT

02:37:38.882 --> 02:37:41.051
WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND

02:37:41.118 --> 02:37:42.486
THEN ONCE WE LEARN WHAT WORKS WE

02:37:42.553 --> 02:37:43.687
CAN SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND

02:37:43.754 --> 02:37:45.222
SHARE THOSE BEST PRACTICES AMONG

02:37:45.289 --> 02:37:45.889
THE COURTS.

02:37:45.956 --> 02:37:47.491
AND INFORM --

02:37:47.558 --> 02:37:48.625
THE POLICY MAKERS.

02:37:48.692 --> 02:37:49.827
SO PART OF MY QUESTION THEN IS

02:37:49.893 --> 02:37:51.361
THAT NOTION OF WHAT WORKS AND

02:37:51.428 --> 02:37:52.496
WHAT DOESN'T WORK.

02:37:52.563 --> 02:37:54.031
I'M NOT TRYING TO PRESUPPOSE

02:37:54.097 --> 02:37:55.899
THAT WE KNOW WHAT WORKS.

02:37:55.966 --> 02:37:57.601
BUT CERTAINLY.

02:37:57.668 --> 02:37:59.069
AND I ALSO DON'T KNOW WHETHER

02:37:59.136 --> 02:38:01.071
HOW MUCH UNIFORMITY THERE MIGHT

02:38:01.138 --> 02:38:02.072
BE.

02:38:02.139 --> 02:38:04.875
IN THESE FORTY EIGHT BACK HER

02:38:04.942 --> 02:38:06.610
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE USING THE

02:38:06.677 --> 02:38:09.313
DIFFERENT FORMS OF RISK

02:38:09.379 --> 02:38:09.813
ASSESSMENT IN PRE TRIAL

02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:10.113
[inaudible]

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:16.887
I'M -- BUT

02:38:16.954 --> 02:38:18.689
IT SEEMS THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME

02:38:18.755 --> 02:38:19.556
STUDIES.

02:38:19.623 --> 02:38:23.327
THAT [inaudible] FOR SOME.

02:38:23.393 --> 02:38:24.661
AS THEIR FAVORITE TURNED OUT

02:38:24.728 --> 02:38:26.563
EVIDENCE BASED.

02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:30.000
INDICATORS OF WHAT'S.

02:38:30.067 --> 02:38:31.668
WHAT MAKES SOME REMOTE MAKES

02:38:31.735 --> 02:38:32.502
THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY MORE

02:38:32.569 --> 02:38:34.538
EFFECTIVE SO WOULDN'T WE WANT TO

02:38:34.605 --> 02:38:36.039
BE?

02:38:36.106 --> 02:38:38.442
ENSURING THAT ANY PILOTS WE ARE

02:38:38.508 --> 02:38:41.011
FINDING ARE HELPING US OF THAT

02:38:41.078 --> 02:38:43.714
HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD. TO DATE

02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:45.315
AS BEING THE MOST EFFECTIVE SO

02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:46.817
THAT WE CAN THEN.

02:38:46.884 --> 02:38:48.752
HAVE THE EVIDENCE THAT IN FACT

02:38:48.819 --> 02:38:50.787
THEY ARE FOR US.

02:38:50.854 --> 02:38:53.390
YES AND AND THE LANGUAGE EXPERT

02:38:53.457 --> 02:38:55.592
TALKS ABOUT VALIDATED TOOLS AND

02:38:55.659 --> 02:38:56.526
IT TALKS ABOUT --

02:38:56.593 --> 02:38:58.495
QUICK DECISION MAKING RIGHT SO

02:38:58.562 --> 02:39:00.230
SO STUDIES HAVE COME OUT THAT

02:39:00.297 --> 02:39:02.432
SHOW THE IMPACT WHEN SOMEONE IS

02:39:02.499 --> 02:39:04.201
DETAINED PRE TRIAL AND AND

02:39:04.268 --> 02:39:06.136
LITERALLY BY THE DAYS THE IMPACT

02:39:06.203 --> 02:39:08.405
THAT HAS ON THEIR FAMILIES ON

02:39:08.472 --> 02:39:10.440
THEIR JOBS OF SOMEONE'S CAR IS

02:39:10.507 --> 02:39:11.441
TOTALED THINGS LIKE THAT THAT

02:39:11.508 --> 02:39:11.942
THAT.

02:39:12.009 --> 02:39:12.976
PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY THINK

02:39:13.043 --> 02:39:14.778
OF IMMEDIATELY WHAT THE IMPACT

02:39:14.845 --> 02:39:16.513
IS AND SELL PART ANOTHER

02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:18.215
OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM THAT'S

02:39:18.282 --> 02:39:18.949
INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET BILL

02:39:19.016 --> 02:39:20.083
LANGUAGE --

02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:22.019
RIGHT NOW IS QUICKER DECISIONS

02:39:22.085 --> 02:39:24.087
BY JUDICIAL OFFICERS IN SO DOING

02:39:24.154 --> 02:39:26.556
WHAT WE CAN AGAIN A LOT OF IT IS

02:39:26.623 --> 02:39:27.824
THROUGH I. T. MAKING SURE THAT

02:39:27.891 --> 02:39:29.092
RISK ASSESSMENT IS DONE.

02:39:29.159 --> 02:39:32.829
MOST OF ALL OF THE REQUEST YOUR

02:39:32.896 --> 02:39:34.298
BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WERE ALL

02:39:34.364 --> 02:39:36.166
I. T. SO I'M HOPING THAT THIS

02:39:36.233 --> 02:39:37.834
PILOT IS NOT PRIMARILY REQUESTS

02:39:37.901 --> 02:39:39.636
FOR IT.

02:39:39.703 --> 02:39:41.305
I I JUST IN TERMS OF THE MONTH

02:39:41.371 --> 02:39:42.239
THE DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

GOING TO THE COUNCIL TO ENSURE

02:39:44.141 --> 02:39:45.742
THAT WE CAN HELP THE COURTS.

02:39:45.809 --> 02:39:47.544

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:49.279
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT

02:39:49.346 --> 02:39:51.214
IT CAN COME TO A JUDICIAL

02:39:51.281 --> 02:39:52.816
OFFICER SO JUDICIAL OFFICER CAN

02:39:52.883 --> 02:39:54.318
MAKE THAT DECISION.

02:39:54.384 --> 02:39:56.119
IN ORDER TO ENHANCE PUBLIC

02:39:56.186 --> 02:39:58.255
SAFETY RETURN TO COURT AND

02:39:58.322 --> 02:39:59.756
MAKING SURE THAT THAT WHEN

SOMEONE IS SAFE TO BE TO BE

02:40:01.892 --> 02:40:03.327
RELEASED PRE TRIAL --

THAT THEY ARE SAFE TO BE

02:40:04.461 --> 02:40:05.662
RELEASED AND THEY DON'T THEY

02:40:05.729 --> 02:40:06.830
DON'T HAVE --

02:40:06.897 --> 02:40:08.632
TO LIVE WITH AND AND DEAL WITH

02:40:08.699 --> 02:40:10.801
THE VERY EXPENSIVE COSTS OF OF

02:40:10.867 --> 02:40:13.270
COMMERCIAL BAIL BONDS IF THERE'S

02:40:13.337 --> 02:40:14.104
A WAY TO GET PEOPLE OUT SOONER.

02:40:14.171 --> 02:40:15.772
I AM SURE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

02:40:15.839 --> 02:40:17.407
QUESTIONS APOLOGIES --

02:40:17.474 --> 02:40:19.876
DOMINATING THIS BUTTON PERHAPS.

02:40:19.943 --> 02:40:20.877
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I

02:40:20.944 --> 02:40:23.213
RACED WERE ONES THAT IN OUR

02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:25.082
MATERIALS EVEN LA ALWAYS RAISE

HAPPY BEFORE.

02:40:32.622 --> 02:40:33.156
EIGHT AS MY COLLEAGUES AS SOME

02:40:33.223 --> 02:40:34.358
OTHER QUESTIONS.

02:40:34.424 --> 02:40:35.459
ABSOLUTELY --

SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE

02:40:37.194 --> 02:40:38.228

02:40:44.368 --> 02:40:45.869
CAN CONSIDER IT AS PART OF YOUR

02:40:45.936 --> 02:40:47.771
SPRING DELIBERATIONS --

02:40:47.838 --> 02:40:49.339
AND WE RECOMMENDED THIS BECAUSE

02:40:49.406 --> 02:40:50.374
WE THOUGHT THAT THE PROGRAM

02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:52.109
COULD BE WORTHWHILE THERE IS

02:40:52.175 --> 02:40:53.477
POSSIBILITY BUT REALLY THE FAULT

02:40:53.543 --> 02:40:54.578
OF THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T HAVE

02:40:54.644 --> 02:40:57.214
ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO EVALUATE

02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:57.781
IT AND WEIGHED AGAINST OTHER

02:40:57.848 --> 02:41:00.283
GENERAL SPECIFICALLY THE KEY

02:41:00.350 --> 02:41:01.518
INFORMATION THAT WE THOUGHT

02:41:01.585 --> 02:41:03.086
NEEDED TO BE ANSWERED SOME OF

02:41:03.153 --> 02:41:04.154
WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY RAISED BY

02:41:04.221 --> 02:41:04.788
MADAM CHAIR.

02:41:04.855 --> 02:41:06.757

02:41:08.625 --> 02:41:09.626
THE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE

02:41:09.693 --> 02:41:10.794
FUNDED AND HOW ARE THEY ALIGN

02:41:10.861 --> 02:41:12.262

02:41:12.329 --> 02:41:13.930
FUNDING TO BE ALLOCATED.

02:41:13.997 --> 02:41:16.299
AND THEN FINALLY HOW WE ENSURE

02:41:16.366 --> 02:41:17.834
THAT THE FUNDED PROGRAMS AND

02:41:17.901 --> 02:41:18.935

02:41:19.002 --> 02:41:20.737

02:41:20.804 --> 02:41:21.805
DECISION MAKING.

02:41:21.872 --> 02:41:23.106
WAS WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION WE

02:41:23.173 --> 02:41:23.840
FOUND THAT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT

02:41:23.907 --> 02:41:25.308
DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:41:25.375 --> 02:41:26.777
EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE WHETHER IT

02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:28.745
WAS STRUCTURED OPERATED AND

02:41:28.812 --> 02:41:30.514
FUNDED IN A MANNER THAT WOULD

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:31.281
REFLECT.

THIS.

02:55:07.964 --> 02:55:09.298
VERSION PROGRAM.

02:55:09.365 --> 02:55:10.566
THAT WE CAN START TO HAVE

02:55:10.633 --> 02:55:13.236
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

02:55:13.302 --> 02:55:15.304
IN TWO OF THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING

02:55:15.371 --> 02:55:18.140
AND HAVE.

THE PRE TRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM

02:55:19.475 --> 02:55:21.711
IT. FOR FULL WEIGHT NOW THAT THE

02:55:21.777 --> 02:55:22.311
WHAT.

02:55:22.378 --> 02:55:24.080
WORKS SO HARD TO GET ALL THAT

02:55:24.146 --> 02:55:25.848
HOUSING LINED UP BECAUSE THAT

02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:27.650
WAS THE BOTTOM RIGHT.

02:55:27.717 --> 02:55:29.185
NOT NOT HAVING A PLACE FOR THE

02:55:29.252 --> 02:55:30.519
PERSON -- TO

02:55:30.586 --> 02:55:32.622

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS

02:55:54.176 --> 02:55:57.146
IMPLEMENTING WHAT WE ALREADY DID

02:55:57.213 --> 02:55:59.148

BUT THIS THE ITEM WE'RE LOOKING

02:56:42.491 --> 02:56:44.794
AT IN THIS PILOT I THINK WHAT WE

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:45.928

THERE'S ALSO VERY SPEECH.

02:56:57.606 --> 02:56:59.108
LANGUAGE.

02:56:59.175 --> 02:57:01.477
VERSION IS CLEARLY.

02:57:01.544 --> 02:57:05.047
NOT ONLY BUT IS BEING APPLIED

02:57:05.114 --> 02:57:07.817
AND WE HAVE MANY --

02:57:07.883 --> 02:57:09.952
PROGRAMS LIKE FIFTEEN ARE BEING

02:57:10.019 --> 02:57:13.622
APPLIED WHERE WE'VE YOUR THAT.

02:57:13.689 --> 02:57:16.225
WE MAY OPT TO NOT EVEN TO BRING

02:57:16.292 --> 02:57:17.626
THE PERSON HOLY.

02:57:17.693 --> 02:57:19.095
BREIL ANOTHER WORDS IT'S NOT

02:57:19.161 --> 02:57:21.464
JUST A PRE TRIAL DIVERSION IT'S

02:57:21.530 --> 02:57:23.666
ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY TRYING TO

02:57:23.733 --> 02:57:25.468
AVOID THE PERSON EVEN BEING

02:57:25.534 --> 02:57:27.837
DEALT WITH WITHIN THE CRIMINAL

02:57:27.903 --> 02:57:28.738
JUSTICE THIS.

02:57:28.804 --> 02:57:31.407
AND THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS

02:57:31.474 --> 02:57:33.642
BRIEF FILED ITS DECISION MAKING

02:57:33.709 --> 02:57:36.412
PILOTS ARE MORE AROUND THOSE.

02:57:36.479 --> 02:57:38.914
INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO WE'RE GOING

02:57:38.981 --> 02:57:40.182
TO ASSUME ARE GOING TO GO TO

02:57:40.249 --> 02:57:41.550
TRIAL.

02:57:41.617 --> 02:57:43.519
BUT HOW DO WE HANDLE.

02:57:43.586 --> 02:57:46.555

OR DO WE RELEASE THEM AND HOW DO

02:57:50.292 --> 02:57:51.961
WE ASSURE PUBLIC SAFETY IN THAT

02:57:52.028 --> 02:57:54.530
AND SO -- I

02:57:54.597 --> 02:57:55.765
WANTED JUST TO MAKE THAT

02:57:55.831 --> 02:57:57.933
DISTINCTION AS I THINK IT IS

02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.301
YOUR POINT IS LEGITIMATE THAT

02:57:59.368 --> 02:58:00.636
IT'S NOT.

02:58:00.703 --> 02:58:03.172

WE HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR ARE

02:58:23.159 --> 02:58:25.094
VERY IMPORTANT.

02:58:25.161 --> 02:58:28.397
IS ELECTED --

02:58:28.464 --> 02:58:30.533
KIND OF LIKE [inaudible]

02:58:41.677 --> 02:58:42.778
THAT.

02:58:42.845 --> 02:58:45.114
WE NEED TO EXPAND THE LAW TO

02:58:45.181 --> 02:58:47.650
COVER OTHER AREAS.

02:58:47.716 --> 02:58:49.885
WELL HEALTH IS LOCAL.

02:58:49.952 --> 02:58:51.887

HAVE A ITEM WHERE WE JUST TALK

02:59:02.198 --> 02:59:03.666

STAFF AND I JUST.

02:59:12.308 --> 02:59:14.510

AS THE CHAIR --

MENTIONED IS A LITTLE BIT

03:00:28.951 --> 03:00:30.753
DIFFERENT IN THAT IT'S GOING TO

ADDRESS ALL THE TRIAL MATTER --

03:00:33.189 --> 03:00:34.690

WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND SEND IT?

03:00:55.311 --> 03:00:56.312
ALRIGHT HONEY IS THAT A MODEL

03:00:56.378 --> 03:00:57.546
THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS THAT THE

03:00:57.613 --> 03:01:00.249
RESOURCES WHERE THEY ARE HAPPEN

03:01:00.316 --> 03:01:01.450
THAT IT.

03:01:01.517 --> 03:01:02.785
AND DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE THE

03:01:02.851 --> 03:01:04.687
WHOLE IDEA OF THIS PROJECT IS TO

03:01:04.753 --> 03:01:07.890
GO DEEPER RECOGNIZING ANIMAL

03:01:07.957 --> 03:01:10.759
LIKE IMPLEMENTING THIS WEEK AND

03:01:10.826 --> 03:01:11.026
AND THAT.

03:01:11.093 --> 03:01:12.328
IS ON BUT OTHER THINGS ARE

03:01:12.394 --> 03:01:13.495
HAPPENING.

03:01:13.562 --> 03:01:15.497
RE TILE RIGHT NOW JUST LAST WEEK

03:01:15.564 --> 03:01:17.433
WE HAD TWO SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS

03:01:17.499 --> 03:01:19.268
THAT HAPPENED BOTH IN THE IN THE

03:01:19.335 --> 03:01:20.402
STATE COURT --

03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:21.737
AND IN THE FEDERAL COURT AS IT

03:01:21.804 --> 03:01:23.205
RELATES TO THE TRIAL IN

03:01:23.272 --> 03:01:24.573
CALIFORNIA.

03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:26.208
THINGS ARE REALLY SHIPPING AS AS

03:01:26.275 --> 03:01:28.110
B. O. F. MENTIONED ON A DAY TO

03:01:28.177 --> 03:01:28.978
DAY BASIS --

03:01:29.044 --> 03:01:30.646
AND WHAT THIS IS DOING IS THIS

03:01:30.713 --> 03:01:32.314
IS GONNA ALLOW US TO REALLY

03:01:32.381 --> 03:01:34.950
CONTINUE TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION.

03:01:35.017 --> 03:01:37.086
TO A DEEP DIVE AND SELL IF AND

03:01:37.152 --> 03:01:38.921
WHEN THE TRIAL HAPPENS BECAUSE

03:01:38.988 --> 03:01:40.456
LIKE MOST PEOPLE AGREE THAT THE

03:01:40.522 --> 03:01:42.024
TRIAL IS NOT GONNA LOOK THE WAY

03:01:42.091 --> 03:01:42.791
IT DOES NOW.

03:01:42.858 --> 03:01:43.926
WE DON'T KNOW DEFINITIVELY WHAT

03:01:43.993 --> 03:01:45.427
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE BUT THIS IS

03:01:45.494 --> 03:01:48.664
ALLOWING US TO PLANT THE SEEDS --

03:01:48.731 --> 03:01:50.733
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PRACTICES

03:01:50.799 --> 03:01:53.068
THAT ARE TESTED AND THAT WORK IN

03:01:53.135 --> 03:01:57.773
ME YEAH.

03:01:57.840 --> 03:01:58.407
BUT WHAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

03:01:58.474 --> 03:01:59.708
DRESSES I I UNDERSTAND.

03:01:59.775 --> 03:02:00.676
SENATOR BILL'S CONCERN IS THAT

03:02:00.743 --> 03:02:01.277
ARE YOU LOOKING AT A PILOT TO

03:02:01.343 --> 03:02:02.077
TEST.

03:02:02.144 --> 03:02:03.178
PRE DIVERSION PROGRAMS WE'VE

03:02:03.245 --> 03:02:06.081
ALREADY AUTHORIZED AND I AND SO

03:02:06.148 --> 03:02:08.584
THAT IS ONE OF THESE CONFUSIONS

03:02:08.651 --> 03:02:10.019
ABOUT THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS.

03:02:10.085 --> 03:02:11.387
AND SO.

03:02:11.453 --> 03:02:12.154
I AGREE WITH SENATOR BELL I
