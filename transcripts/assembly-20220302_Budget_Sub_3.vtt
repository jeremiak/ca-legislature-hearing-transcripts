WOULD EVEN BE NEEDED I GUESS ONE

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.781
SILVER LINING WE CAN FIND IN

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:11.816
CURRENT CONDITIONS IS BUT AT

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:13.617
LEAST BY THE TIME YOU NEED TO

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.753
MAKE YOUR FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.654
WE DO HAVE MORE CLARITY

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:17.922
TYPICALLY ABOUT WHAT THE

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:19.690
HYDROLOGY. IT'S GOING TO BE FOR

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.926
THE COMING YEAR AND IT'S- AS THE

00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:23.260
SECRETARY NOTED NOT LOOKING

00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:25.930
GREAT SO KIND OF KEEPING YOUR

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:26.997
EYE ON THAT ON THAT FUNDING SET

00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:28.699
ASIDE FOR FUTURE DECISIONS IN

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.401
THE COMING MONTHS PROBABLY THAT

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.870
WILL BE MERITED. BUT OF THE FIVE

00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:34.205
MILLION IN SPECIFIC PROPOSALS

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.307
THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IT'S

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:37.775
REALLY IN OUR CHARACTERIZATION

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:39.543
OF PRETTY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:41.312
THAT THAT IS FOR THE IMMEDIATE-

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:45.116
URGENT. WE HAVE. AROUND SIXTY

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.350
FIVE. OF THE FIVE HUNDRED

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:48.519
MILLION WOULD BE FOR MORE.

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:51.522
SENATE URGENT. BUDGET YEAR. THE

00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:54.425
BEST MY- OF IT IS FOR A LONGER

00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:56.494
TERM. DRIVERS ON. THAT NOT A BAD

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.928
THING AS THE SECRETARY NOTED I

00:39:57.995 --> 00:40:00.164
MEAN IS THAT THE BEST TIME TO.

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.732
PREPARE FOR A DROUGHT AND

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:03.234
RESPOND TO DROUGHT IS BEFORE IT

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.401
HAPPENS BECAUSE THE PROJECTS

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:06.637
TYPICALLY DO TAKE. PART IN SOME

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.739
KEY YEARS TO DEVELOP AN PERMIT

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:10.541
AND CONSTRUCT OR IF THERE ARE

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:12.843
POLICY CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.678
MADE- THAT SAID THAT YOU MADE A

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:17.381
VERY SIGNIFICANT. INVESTMENT AND

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:18.682
DROUGHT AND WATER RESILIENCE IN

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:21.719
THAT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:23.687
BUDGET PACKAGE INCLUDING FUNDING

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:24.855
EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.090
THAT WILL BE FOR THAT UPCOMING

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:27.925
BUDGET YEAR. SO EVEN IF YOU

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:29.393
APPROVE NONE OF THESE NEW

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.594
PROPOSALS THE STATE WOULD STILL

00:40:30.661 --> 00:40:32.263
BE MAKING REALLY SIGNIFICANT

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:34.431
PROGRESS ON THAT GOAL. TOWARDS

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:35.566
BUILDING GREATER DROUGHT

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:38.102
RESILIENCE. SO WE WOULD JUST

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:39.537
ADVISE YOU TO WEIGH THIS AMONGST

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:41.572
ALL OF YOUR OTHER BUDGET

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:42.706
PRIORITIES. SHOULD YOU DECIDE

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:43.941
THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE ADDITIONAL

00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:46.544
INVESTMENTS IN THESE GOALS. THAT

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.812
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:49.146
PACKAGES THE ONLY A BRIBE.

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:50.848
OPTION AVAILABLE FOR YOU YOU CAN

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:53.384
ALSO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THAT

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.919
TO REFLECT YOUR PRIORITIES. IN

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:57.121
PARTICULAR- WE WOULD SUGGEST YOU

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.290
THINK ABOUT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:00.791
IT'S A PRETTY MODEST AMOUNT IN

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.326
THIS PACKAGE THIRTY MILLION

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:04.361
DOLLARS FOR THAT- KIND OF

00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:07.031
ACTIVITY. WHICH AS THIS IS A

00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:08.766
VERY PROMISING FOR BOTH THE

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:10.367
WATER SUPPLY AND WATER STORAGE.

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:12.102
APPROACH BUT ALSO FOR OTHER

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:14.205
BENEFITS LIKE FLOOD CONTROL SO

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:15.940
THINKING ABOUT IF YOU WANTED TO

00:41:16.006 --> 00:41:17.675
DO PERHAPS GREATER INVESTMENT IN

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:19.410
GROUNDWATER STORE AT RECHARGE

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:22.213
PROJECTS. IN CONTRAST YOU MIGHT

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:23.981
WANT TO THINK ABOUT A SMALLER

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.216
INVESTMENT IN WATER CONSERVATION

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:26.951
GIVEN HOW MUCH WORK THE STATE

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:29.019
HAS DONE. EIGHTY THREE POLICY

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:33.557
CHANGES AND HOW MUCH PROGRESS.

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:35.125
WE HAVE SEEN IN REJECT AND IN

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:36.727
WATER USE AND IN. EFFICIENCY IN

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:37.928
THE URBAN. AND GIVEN THAT THE

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.630
URBAN SETTING IS ROOM IS ABOUT.

00:41:39.697 --> 00:41:41.732
SMALL SHARE OF OVERALL WATER USE

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:42.600
AS COMPARED TO AGRICULTURE FOR

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:44.802
EXAMPLE IN THE STATE. OF THE

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:46.737
LABOR PURPOSING PROGRAM THAT THE

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:47.872
SECRETARY MENTIONED IT SHOWS A

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:49.640
LOT OF PROMISE BUT WAS JUST

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:51.475
STARTED LAST YEAR WE STILL DON'T

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:52.710
HAVE A SENSE OF. HOW THAT

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:54.578
PROGRAM WILL SHAPE UP WITH THE

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:55.980
DEMAND IS SO YOU COULD THINK

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.581
ABOUT KIND OF WAITING TO SEE HOW

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:59.250
THE FIRST ROUND AND FIRST YEAR

00:41:59.316 --> 00:41:59.950
ON THAT PROGRAM GOES BEFORE

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:02.720
MAKING FURTHER INVESTMENTS. SO

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:03.921
IS IT REALLY A LOT OF OPTIONS

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:05.789
BEFORE YOU AS YOU THINK ABOUT

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:07.024
WHAT THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES FOR

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.592
ACHIEVING THESE IMPORTANT GOALS

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:10.961
ARE. WE WOULD OF COURSE ALSO

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:11.662
REMIND YOU THAT THE STATE

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:13.163
APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OR GAN

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.531
LIMIT IS GOING TO BE AN

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:15.900
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AGAIN

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:17.768
THIS YEAR SO THINKING ABOUT IF

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:19.737
YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT CATIONS TO

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:21.238
THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE. HOW THAT

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:23.307
WILL FOCUS AFFECT YOUR OVERALL

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:27.344
GAN OR SELL THEM THE PACKAGE AND

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:29.113
REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN THE FINAL

00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:31.248
POINT THAT WE WOULD MAKE IS JUST

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:32.650
THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERSIGHT. AT

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.852
WHEN THE STATE HAS IN THE PAST

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.353
PASSED A LARGE WATER BONDS

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.255
THERE'S A LOT OF OVERSIGHT AND

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:40.057
REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.392
THAT'S BUILT INTO THE LANGUAGE

00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:43.694
TYPICALLY. THIS WAS ALMOST LIKE

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.262
A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR WATER BOND

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:48.332
THAT WAS PASSED. IN IN THE MOST

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:49.066
RECENT YEAR BUT DIDN'T HAVE ALL

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:50.501
OF THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:52.569
AND REPORTING LANGUAGE BUILT IN.

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:53.604
SO THAT'S WHY THE

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:55.172
ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN REALLY

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.707
HELPFUL ABOUT PROVIDING A LOT OF

00:42:56.774 --> 00:42:57.841
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH

00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.044
FUNDING HAS HAS BEEN COMMITTED

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.079
ALREADY BUT THOSE ARE THE KINDS

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:03.380
OF REPORTS THAT WE WOULD.

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:04.515
ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE

00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:05.249
REQUESTING FROM THE

00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:07.685
ADMINISTRATION NOT JUST BECAUSE

00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:09.386
GOOD OVERSIGHT OVER SPENDING IS

00:43:09.453 --> 00:43:10.754
GOOD GOVERNMENT TO AND

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:12.356
ACCOUNTABILITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:13.791
THAT INFORMATION CAN REALLY HELP

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.626
GUIDE YOUR FUTURE DECISIONS NOT

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:16.961
JUST FOR THIS YEAR BUT IN THE

00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:18.295
COMING YEARS ABOUT. WHERE

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:20.230
THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND WHERE

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:21.799
THERE MAY BE SOME CHALLENGES

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.600
WHERE IT'S HARD GETTING FINDING

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:26.003
OUT THE DOOR- WHERE THERE MAY BE

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.005
VERY OR REAL SUCCESS. AND I

CAN'T IT. AS YOU'RE MAKING

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.744
FUTURE. SPENDING DECISIONS. SO

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.546
WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY.

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:36.747

THE ADMINISTRATION IS EXTREMELY

00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:47.324
HELPFUL AND IMPORTANT. AND-

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:49.727

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:03.540
BILLION DOLLAR CONTINGENCY- ON

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:06.610
DROUGHT I- COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:09.546
THAT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE

00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:10.914
WE'RE HEADED WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:14.485
DROUGHT BUT- ON THE FLIP SIDE.

00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:17.354
BOB IF WE WAIT UNTIL MAY REVISE

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:21.658
TO- THINK ABOUT AND DISCUSS-

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:22.926
WHAT THIS QUARTER OF A BILLION

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:24.728
DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE UTILIZED

00:44:24.795 --> 00:44:25.696
FOR THAT'S PRETTY LATE IN THE

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:28.198
GAME I MEAN MAY REVISE IS

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:32.302
ALREADY- A BIG RUSH TO THE BIG

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.405
COMMENCES A BIG RUSH TO THE- TO

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:37.608

00:44:37.674 --> 00:44:40.544
TO ME. THAT THIS CONTINGENCY

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:44.448
FUND IF WERE. WAITING TO UTILIZE

IT FOR- TO ADDRESS WHATEVER THE

00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:51.555
CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE AT. A LATER

00:44:51.622 --> 00:44:54.124
TIME THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS FOR

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:56.493
URGENT NEAR TERM USES. AND THERE

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.195
OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST SOME

00:44:58.262 --> 00:44:59.563

REVISED. WHAT THE TRIGGERS ARE

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:06.503
WITH THE METRICS ARE FOR THE USE

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.739
OF- OF THAT MONEY IS THAT

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:11.108
SOMETHING. THAT YOU THINK YOU

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:15.612
CAN GET TO US- SHORTLY. AS

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:17.481
OPPOSED TO HAVING TO WAIT UNTIL

MAY. WELL THANKS FOR THE COMMENT

AND POINT WELL TAKEN THE LAST

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:23.687
THING THAT WE WANT TO DO IS JAM

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:24.955
THE DISCUSSION ON SUCH A LARGE

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.757
AMOUNT OF FUNDING- AT THE SAME

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:29.460
TIME OBVIOUSLY WE WANTED TO BE

00:45:29.526 --> 00:45:30.427
RESPONSIVE TO THE SPECIFIC

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:31.228
CONDITIONS THAT THEY WERE

THE ONE OF THE SNOW YES AND WHAT

00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:39.236
IS DECEMBER THAT WE HAD SO WE

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:40.604
JUST WEREN'T SURE YOU KNOW HOW

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:42.506
AND IF AND HOW THE FUNDING WOULD

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.441
BE NEEDED THAT BEING SAID I WILL

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:45.042
WORK WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:47.211
FINANCE IN OUR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.384
DOLLARS BEFORE THE MAY REVISED

UNLESS SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:34.918
IT SEEMS LIKE WE OUGHT TO BE

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:36.720
ABLE TO START TO. TO UNDERSTAND

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:37.821
WHAT THE SITUATION IS WHICH IS

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:40.591
IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS AS WE AS WE

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.626
MOVE FORWARD SO. I'LL LEAVE THAT

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:43.660

OUT THERE IT'S IDENTIFIED THAT-

00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:56.607
THERE IS JUST- INSUFFICIENT

00:47:56.673 --> 00:48:00.510
CAPACITY- IN TERMS OF- BEING

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:01.812
ABLE TO ADMINISTER ALL THINGS WE

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:04.448
HAVE TO DO AND AS A RESULT. WE

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:06.817
DO HAVE- ONE TIME FUNDING FOR

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:08.218
EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS FOR

I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHY WE INVEST

00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:16.193
THAT WAY AND NOT JUST BUILD UP

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.295
THE CAPACITY. AND I HAVEN'T

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:19.830
NUMBER QUESTIONS ALONG THIS

00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:24.368
LINE. AND I GUESS I WOULD BUT

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:25.802
PREFACE THAT MALL BY SAYING

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.204
THIS. IT'S VERY POSSIBLE

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:30.007
CALIFORNIA IS NOT JUST IN A

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:32.109

00:48:32.175 --> 00:48:33.744
CHARACTERIZATION. OF WHICH THE

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.112
DIFFERENCE BEING THAT DROUGHT

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:36.580

THIS NEW NORMAL WHICH IS. YOU

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:41.084
KNOW IT'S KIND OF HYDROLOGICALLY

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:41.585
AND MEDIA ARE LOGICALLY

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:43.587
TERRIFYING AND I THINK THE MORE

00:53:43.653 --> 00:53:46.022
WE TALK ABOUT IT. THE BETTER

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:50.427
EVERYONE WILL BE. YES PLEASE.

THERE I ON VIDEO- VERY QUICKLY

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:04.040
THE DEPARTMENT- IS DOING QUITE A

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:06.176
BIT OF WORK AS A RESULT OF THE

00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:07.344
LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:10.847
FUNDING LAST YEAR TO IMPROVE OUR

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:13.783
ABILITY- FRANKLY TO UNDERSTAND

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.752
THE NEW NORMAL AND IT THE LEVEL

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:17.020
OF DESTRUCTION UP TO OUR WATER

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:19.589
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO A COUPLE OF

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:22.826
THE THINGS. OF THE ONE IS WE ARE

00:54:22.892 --> 00:54:25.729
INVESTING IN IMPROVEMENTS TO

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:28.231
FORECASTING FROM THE DEPARTMENT

00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:30.333
ACTUALLY THROUGH ITS FLOOD

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.737
MANAGEMENT- CANDLES FORECASTING-

00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:35.839
BEFORE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:38.241
AND THAT INFORMATION IS VERY

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:40.677
IMPORTANT- NOT JUST TO- D. W.

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.979
ARE THE STATE WATER PROJECT BUT

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:45.181
ALSO MANY MANY LOCAL WATER

00:54:45.248 --> 00:54:47.350
DISTRICTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.785
CAPACITY TO DO THAT KIND OF

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:50.320
TECHNICAL WORK THEMSELVES THEY

00:54:50.387 --> 00:54:51.921
RELY ON THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:53.623
THEIR OWN WATER MANAGEMENT

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.825
DECISIONS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:56.860
INFORMATION FOR THE WATER

00:54:56.926 --> 00:54:59.496
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD OF LAST

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:02.132
YEAR- AS YOU KNOW AND THIS YEAR-

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:03.733
IN TERMS OF DROUGHT RESPONSE

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.569
THERE'S- AT ALL LIKELIHOOD WHEN

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.872
THE HYDROLOGY DOESN'T PROVIDE

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:10.607
ENOUGH WATER FOR ALL LEGITIMATE

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:13.410
WATER NEEDS OF TYPICALLY THE

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:15.478
WATER BOARD GOES THROUGH OUR A

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:17.647
CURTAILMENT PROCESS AND ALL OF

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:18.548
OUR FORECASTING INFORMATION

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.684
HELPS THE WATER BOARD ALSO MAKE

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:23.086
THOSE KINDS OF DETERMINATIONS SO

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.020
THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'RE

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:25.989
DOING THIS YEAR FRANKLY IN REAL

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:29.626
TIME IS MOVING TOWARDS- ARIEL

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:32.128
SNOW OBSERVATION. SO IF YOU CAN

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:35.532
IMAGINE- YOU KNOW WE'VE RELIED

00:55:35.598 --> 00:55:38.935
ON- BOTH OUR PHYSICAL- OUR OUR

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:40.737
PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT OF SNOWPACK

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.772
THAT'S THE THING THAT REALLY

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:45.475
ATTRACTS A LOT OF- SORT MEDIA

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:47.777
IT'S JUST VERY ACCESSIBLE WHERE

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:52.682
WE GO WITH THESE TOOLS AND. WE-

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:55.452
WE MEASURE THE SNOW WHY CON. THE

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:56.486
DEPARTMENT BEEN DOING THAT- FOR.

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:58.688
WE HAVE AN AND- A RESOURCE OF

00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:01.357
DATA- I'M GOING BACK TO-

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:03.159
ESSENTIALLY A HUNDRED YEARS WERE

00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:06.329
WERE- WE'RE MEASURING PHYSICALLY

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:07.764
AND ALL THE SAME LOCATION SO WE

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:09.599
UNDERSTAND SNOW PATTERN WITH

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:12.936
THIS YEAR- BUT WE ALSO- YOU SNOW

00:56:13.002 --> 00:56:15.438
SENSORS- WHAT WE LEARNED LAST

00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:17.340
YEAR- WHAT IS THAT THAT'S NOT

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:19.142
ENOUGH. I'M LAST YEAR WE HAD A

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:21.745
TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE- IN TERMS

00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:25.148
OF UNDERSTANDING SNOW PACK AND-

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.450
WHAT IT WOULD TRANSLATE IN TERMS

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:29.986
OF- RUN OFF INTO RIVERS STREAMS

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:32.088
AND RESERVOIRS SO THIS YEAR

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:34.090
WE'VE ADDED- THIS ARIEL SNOW

00:56:34.157 --> 00:56:36.659
OBSERVATORY. THAT CAN LOOK AT

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:38.962
THE SIERRA- ALL THE WAY TO THE

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:42.165
TOP- IN PARTICULAR WATERSHEDS

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:45.034
AND IT ENABLES US TO IDENTIFY-

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:46.836
HOUSE OF THE LINE FOR SNOW PACK

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:49.706
IS RETREATING FURTHER UPS UP THE

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:51.608
SLOPES OF THE SIERRA. AND WE CAN

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.643
DO THAT YOU KNOW EFFECTIVELY ON

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:55.979
A MONTHLY BASIS AND WE CAN ALSO

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:58.715
ANALYZE IN THREE METER GRIDS THE

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:01.651
SNOW WATER CONTENT DOWN TO ABOUT

00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:03.253
AN INCH OR TWO. SO IT'S AN

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:05.855
AWESOME- A SET OF TOOLS THAT THE

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:07.190
DEPARTMENT IS DEPLOYING MORE

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:09.192
WIDELY THIS YEAR TO INTEGRATE

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:11.561
INTO OUR FORECASTING. OF THE

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:13.363
SECOND THING THAT WE'RE WORKING

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:14.898
ON WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE A

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:16.366
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO THE

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:18.101
THREE YEARS OUT. BECAUSE IT'S

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:20.136
MORE COMPLEX IS INTEGRATING INTO

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:22.505
OUR MODELING SYSTEMS THAT SOIL

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:25.675
MOISTURE IN AMBIENT TEMPERATURES

00:57:25.742 --> 00:57:27.577
SO THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:28.611
CAPTURE WHAT'S HAPPEN WHEN WE

00:57:28.678 --> 00:57:30.947
HAVE THE SNOW PACK. WHAT'S THE

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:33.116
LIKELIHOOD THAT IT'S GOING TO

00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:35.051
SEEP INTO THE GROUND AND

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:37.554
EVAPORATE AMIDST- INCREASING

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:39.589
AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND FRANKLY

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:41.558
INCREASING LOW TEMPERATURES ON

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:43.526
AVERAGE AND WE'RE VERY MUCH.

00:57:43.593 --> 00:57:46.429
SEEING THAT TREND- THAT WILL

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:53.436
REQUIRE A PEER REVIEW- THAT. IS

00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:54.537
A REAL ADJUSTMENT TO IN HISTORY

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:56.506
STAND- CAL IS VERY MUCH THE- IN

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:58.575
THAT KIND OF WORK HAVE A LOT OF

00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:01.177
PARKER IN THAT WORK. AT THE

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:01.845
FEDERAL LEVEL OUR COLLEAGUES AT

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:03.513
THE U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.515
PARTICULARLY IN DENVER BUT ALSO-

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:09.519
AT. AND U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:10.653
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.422
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING I

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:14.224
THINK THE NEXT SET OF

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.625
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:17.527
WHICH IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL A

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:18.094
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE THINK

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.996
ABOUT- SOME OF THE PRODUCT

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:22.365
CHALLENGES THAT. WE HAVE THE

00:58:22.432 --> 00:58:23.666
OVERDRAFT IN THE VALLEY OF

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.568
CENTRAL VALLEY AND WHAT IT'S

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:27.637
GOING TO TAKE TO- REVERSE THAT

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:30.707
TREND- LAST YEAR- THE

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.742
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:35.078
OFFICE PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENT.

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:36.613
WITH MONEY TO BUILD UPON SOME

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:38.815
IMPORTANT PILOT WORK THAT WE

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:42.619
STARTED- IN THE MERCED WATERSHED

00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:44.621
IN THE TWELVE. WOLLEMI RIVER

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:47.323
WATER. WHERE WE GO S. HEADWATERS

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:49.592
TO FLOODPLAIN AND WE EVALUATE

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.527
THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE AND OTHER

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:55.031
RISKS ON. ON WATER QUALITY ON

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:57.634
THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE ON WATER

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:01.537
SYSTEMS ON FLOOD- AND HOW WE CAN

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:04.440
ACTUALLY MOVE THAT WATER- TO

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:05.775
MEET ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF.

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:08.511
CLIMATE DRIVEN INTENSE DEMANDS

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:10.546
BOB THE DEPARTMENT IS EXPANDING

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.515
THAT RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS TO

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.417
ALL WATERSHEDS THAT FEED INTO

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:15.919
THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALL OF THOSE

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:18.554
MAJOR WATERSHEDS. SO THAT WE CAN

00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:20.556
PROVIDE BETTER INFORMATION- NOT

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:22.759
ONLY TO THE- GROUNDWATER

00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:25.161
SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES BUT ALSO

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:28.264
THE SURFACE WATER- WATER SUPPLY

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:30.433
DISTRICT IN THAT AREA. AND

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:31.868
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S GOING TO

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:33.703
TAKE IT AND- AND EVERYONE'S

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.438
REALLY GOING TO TAKE NOTE OF

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:38.141
THAT WATER. SCENE GOING TO BE A

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:39.709
VERY PROMINENT THEME IN OUR- A

00:59:39.776 --> 00:59:41.577
CALIFORNIA WATER PLANTS WE ARE

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:43.546
JUST STARTING THE UPDATE. ON

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:46.249
THAT AS YOU KNOW THAT'S- THAT'S

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:47.750
MANDATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:50.353
BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS AND

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.221
YOU'LL SEE ALL THAT KIND OF

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:53.489
ADVANCE PLANNING WORK. ON THAT

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:55.692
HELPS US REALLY ADAPT THE NEW

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:58.027
NORMAL IT WILL BE HUGELY

00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:00.396
IMPORTANT- AND WORKING- BETWEEN

LONGER DO WHAT WAS DONE IN

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:48.578
RECENT DECADES WAS THINK ABOUT

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:50.213
DROUGHT ISN'T AS AS AN EPISODE

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:52.281
THAT HAPPENS ONCE A DECADE OR

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:54.951
TWO. BUT RATHER- ESSENTIALLY-

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:57.887
CONSISTENT OR CONSISTENT THREAT-

THESE TO GENERAL COMMA AND ONE

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:24.514
IS THAT. DEMOCRACY IS JUST DON'T

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.549
NORMALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.351
PLANNING AHEAD. YOU KNOW WE ARE

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.753
SO RESPONSIVE TO END UP AND THE

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.754
PUBLIC DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.790
LOOK AHEAD. AND THE PUBLIC DOES

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.625
WANT TO HEAR YOU KNOW IF YOU DO

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:36.859
THIS HARD THING NOW THINGS WILL

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:38.594
BE BETTER FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.829
AT THAT JUST DEMOCRACY DON'T DO

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.631
THAT VERY WELL. IN THOSE OF US

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:43.399
IN A POSITION OF LEADERSHIP HAVE

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.635
A RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO DO AS

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:47.737
MUCH OF THAT AS POSSIBLE SO I

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:48.571
APPRECIATE. THE GOVERNOR'S

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.006
POSITION AND I APPRECIATE YOU

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:52.809
COMMUNICATING THAT- THE- THE

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.310
SECOND THING THAT I'D LIKE TO

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.746
JUST POINT OUT AS YOU KNOW WE

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:57.647
TALK ABOUT THE NEW NORMAL AND-

01:01:57.713 --> 01:02:00.216
THAT MEANS FOR EXAMPLE AS WE

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:02.251
TALK ABOUT CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.286
IT'S NOT JUST IN THE CENTRAL

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.588
VALLEY THAT WE HAVE TO. WE'RE

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:06.789
GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE HEARD OF

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.858
OUR PROJECTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:10.827
SUSTAINABLE BUT IN ADDITION TO

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.895
THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WE

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:14.831
WEREN'T SUSTAINABLE. BEFORE THE

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.800
NEW NORMAL. AND SO WE SORT OF

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.302
HAVE A DOUBLE THE DOUBLE PROJECT

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:22.371
AHEAD OF US WE NEEDED TO GET TO

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:23.906
SUSTAINABLE IF WE WOULD HAVE

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:25.608
STAYED IN THE OLD CONDITIONS AND

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.110
NOW WE HAVE EVEN THE MORE

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.412
EXTREME ISSUE OF. HAVING A NEW

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:30.680
NORMAL HIT US ON TOP OF THAT SO

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:36.152
THE URGENCY. IS- IT IS GOOD TO.

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:38.654
COME AND IT IS LIKE THAT KIDS

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:40.756
AND- OF THE LILIES ON THE THING

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:43.826
THAT. THE DID DID DID NEED THE

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.962
PUBLIC'S GONNA BE ON TOP OF THIS

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:47.630
REALLY FAST- IF THE DIRE PROJECT

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.866
PROJECTIONS- COME FORWARD. SO

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.834
WITH THAT I HAVE I'LL TRY TO

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.836

HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS SMALL

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.342
PROGRAM- WE'RE GOING TO MAKE TWO

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:08.544
MORE ROUNDS OF GRANTS AND SO WE

MILLION MORE IN ADDITION- IT

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:23.025
SHOULD BE- CONSIDERED IN

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:24.894
COMBINATION WITH FUNDING THAT

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.462
THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:29.165
BOARD ALSO PASSED IN TERMS OF-

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:31.667
RESPONDING TO SOME OF THESE-

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.436
SOME OF THESE SMALL WATER SYSTEM

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:36.138
ISSUES SO FOR EXAMPLE ASSEMBLY

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:39.342
MEN. I'M A LOT OF THE WORK THAT

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:41.777
WE DO- IN RELATIONSHIP- WITH THE

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:45.448
WATER BOARD IS FOCUSED ON- THAT

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:48.184
DOLLARS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:50.286
COMPLIMENTING OR OR WORKING IN

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:52.188
TANDEM WITH DOLLARS THAT THE

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:55.291
WATER BOARD- HAS TO PUT TOWARDS

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.159
SMALL SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION FOR

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.262
EXAMPLE OR OTHER KINDS OF

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:02.598
DRINKING WATER FOCUSED- DROUGHT

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:06.002
RESILIENCE DOLLARS- INTERN. OF

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:08.137
WHAT WE THINK YOU KNOW THE

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:10.840
OVERALL- SORT OF APPETITE IS FOR

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:14.010
THOSE THAT FUNDING- I WILL BE

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:16.479
ABLE TO GIVE YOU WHAT A DOLLAR

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.314
ANSWERED TODAY BUT- AND WE CAN

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:21.284
COME BACK AND TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.386
MORE ABOUT THAT. BUT WE THE

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:25.554
DEPARTMENT PUT OUT. AN

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:27.056
ASSESSMENT OF- DROUGHT

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.025
VULNERABILITY FOR THESE SMALL

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:31.527
SYSTEMS AND WE EXPECT THAT ON

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.729
THE THROUGH THE FUNDING THAT'S

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:35.331
BEEN MADE AVAILABLE THAT WE

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:37.033
WILL. ESSENTIALLY BE ABLE TO

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:40.703
ADDRESS ABOUT THE TOP 10215% OF

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:42.305
THOSE IDENTIFIED THAT SMALL

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.640
SYSTEMS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AND

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:45.908
THEN TOGETHER WITH THE WATER

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:47.476
BOARD- THERE'S PROBABLY IT'S

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.712
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OF. A SMALL

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.580
AGENCIES THAT WE HAVE ALREADY

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:53.449
IDENTIFIED AS BEING. UNIQUELY

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.551
VULNERABLE TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.420
SO WE THINK THAT THE SIXTY

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:59.722
MILLION- WILL ENABLE US TO GET.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.824
A WHOLE LOT FURTHER- I WOULD

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:05.194
ALSO SAY THAT. THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:08.264
IMPLEMENTING- SENATE BILL FIVE

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:09.465
FIVE TWO WHICH IS PUTTING

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:13.569
TOGETHER A TASK FORCE- OF- NOT

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:16.305
JUST STATE AGENCIES BUT LOCAL

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:18.874
AGENCIES TO HELP DIRECT THE- D.

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:21.711
W. R. AND- ALSO SOME OF THE

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:24.246
WATER BOARD'S EFFORTS- TO. BE

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:26.682
RESPONSIVE TO THOSE- WATER

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:29.352
SUPPLY NEEDS- FOR THOSE WERE ALL

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.187
KINDS OF COMMUNITIES SO WE WOULD

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:34.223
EXPECT- GETTING THAT- TASK FORCE

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.691
UP AND GOING IT WAS- I'M STARTED

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.560
AT THE BEGINNING OF. JANUARY

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:40.162
ONE- WE EXPECT TO HAVE THAT- UP

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:43.165
AND GOING AND AS- A MECHANISM TO

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:46.569
HELP DIRECT FUTURE FUNDING- THAT

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:48.404
MIGHT BE. NEEDED IN THESE KINDS

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.473
OF COMMUNITY THANK YOU. I DON'T

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:54.009
WANT PUSH TO AND CHAIRMAN GOOD A

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:55.111
BLUE SAYS GOOD GREAT INTER

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.947
ACROSS SO- I I'VE THIS IS THIS

01:06:58.013 --> 01:06:59.682
IS. THIS ISN'T A COMBINATION OF

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:02.017
A QUESTION THAT THEY'LL DO IT IN

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.652
THE FORM OF A COMMENT AND HOPE

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:05.287
THAT- OF AGENCY- OVERALL WILL

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.723
CONSIDER THIS BUT WE HAVE FOUR

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.525
HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILLION FOR

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.260
WATER AND WASTEWATER- NOW-

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:14.630
ARRANGE PAYMENT PROGRAM- AND I.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.966
I JUST WONDER WHETHER SOME OF

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:19.735
THAT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THREE

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:20.836
MILLION COULD INSTEAD BE USED IT

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:26.175
TO SUPPLEMENT. A SIXTY MILLION

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:28.043
GOING TO THE AND SMALL. DROUGHT

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.945
RELIEF. THAT ACTUALLY- TO

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:31.580
MILLION FOR WANTED SIXTY MILLION

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:32.648
FOR THE OTHER BUT- AND THE

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.718
REASON I SAY THAT IS THAT I FEEL

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.453
PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THE LARGE-

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.488
PUMPERS ARE GOING TO BE PRETTY

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:43.192
SUCCESSFUL- AT- LOBBYING HERE

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:44.760
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE THE SMALL

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:46.328
WATER AGENCIES IN THE SMALL

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.898
FARMERS THAT ARE- THAT WE WERE

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:51.467
ALREADY SEEING STORIES OF YOU

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:53.502
KNOW IF THE COMMUNITIES OF YOU

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:54.970
KNOW THOUSAND FARM WORKERS AND-

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:55.771
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.273
TO. DEEP IN THERE WELL THEY

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:59.308
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.210
THEY'RE LITERALLY OUT OF WATER I

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.912
WANT TO MAKE SURE SO I HOPE THAT

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:03.679
WE COULD INCREASE THE CAPACITY

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:05.614
THERE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.316
WITH THAT I'LL JUST JUMP OVER

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:09.151
TO- TWO OTHER QUICK THINGS I

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:10.553
HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF-

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:13.155
CONSERVATION- WHEN THEY'RE

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:14.156
AROUND LOOKING AT THE MULTI

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:17.359
BENEFIT RE PURPOSING OF LAND-

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.329
WOULD CONSIDER SOLAR FARMS ON

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:22.331
THAT LAND IF WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW.

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:25.534
FARMLAND WE HAVE HUGE ENERGY

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:27.369
NEEDS AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:28.571
WITH OUR ENERGY NEEDS IS THAT WE

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:31.207
DON'T HAVE PLACES- FOR YOU KNOW

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:32.541
FIGHT FINDING THE RIGHT AMOUNT

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:35.277
OF LAND- AND IN APPROPRIATE

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:37.480
PLACES AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:38.614
THE DEPARTMENT WOULD CAREFULLY

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:39.982
LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:42.384
BE A WIN WIN ON BOTH SIDES SOLAR

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:43.986
PANELS. AND FOLLOWING THE LAND-

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:47.156
TO TRY TO HELP US WITH- THE

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:49.758
WATER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AND

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:52.695
THEN- HE GIVEN HOW LONG THIS IS

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.597
GOOD IT THE RIDGES BOXES OF

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:55.931
BENTON AND DISK BEST PART A

01:08:55.998 --> 01:08:57.967
CONVERSATION I JUST WOULD SAY I

01:08:58.033 --> 01:09:04.240
AM VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT- SIGMA

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:06.041
AND THE- PUMPING THAT IS STILL

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:07.176
GOING ON AND SO. OF THESE THESE

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.711
PLACES AND WE'RE HAVING OVER

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:10.913
PUMPING AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:14.283
HAVING- DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.618
AND AT RISK COMMUNITIES

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:16.652
LITERALLY RUNNING OUT OF

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:20.356
DRINKING WATER. AND- IT IT SEEMS

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:21.724
TO ME THAT- WE HAVE TO

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:25.127
ACCELERATE- WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:28.230
WITH WITH CIGNA- SO THAT WE YOU

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:30.199
KNOW WE DON'T HAVE WITHOUT

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:32.167
THOUSAND DOMESTIC WELLS GO DRY

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:36.205
LAST YEAR- THAT. THIS COULD BE

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:38.741
MANY THOUSANDS MORE THAN THAT IF

01:09:38.807 --> 01:09:40.276
THE NEW NORMAL CONTINUES- AND WE

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:41.844
DON'T PUT A PRIORITY ON THAT SO

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:44.513
I HOPE THAT WE CAN REALLY WE'D I

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.515
DID JUST THINK THAT. OF THE

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:47.983
TWENTY YEAR TIME FRAME AND SIGMA

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:52.121
IS- IS VERY GENEROUS AND TO WITH

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:53.589
THE NEW NORMAL OUT THERE IT'S

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.691
GOING TO BE A REAL PROBLEM FOR

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:56.692
DRINKING WATER SO- THEY'LL BE

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:58.093
MORE THINGS ON THAT THAT'LL

WANT TO ON PARTICULARLY THINK

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.732
THE SECRETARY WHO I THINK IT'S

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:39.101
REALLY BEEN A AMAZING LEADER IN

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:41.170

ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO SEE HIM

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.673
HERE- FIRST MY COMMENT IS THAT

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.309
WE I THINK THAT AS WE HAVE THESE

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:49.745
DISCUSSIONS WE REALLY DO NEED TO

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:50.679
ALWAYS REMEMBER. THAT WHAT WE'RE

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.448
SEEING NOW WITH CLIMATE. AND

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:53.916
WITH DROUGHT WHICH IS THE NEW

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:56.785
NORMAL IS THE RESULT OF HUMAN.

01:10:56.852 --> 01:10:58.454
CAUSED CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT'S

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.155
UNDENIABLE IF YOU BELIEVE IT ALL

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:01.924
IN SCIENCE IF YOU THINK THAT

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:05.461
NASA JPL- HAS ERA- IF YOU

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:06.061
BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:11:06.128 --> 01:11:09.765
PUT. A ROVER ON MARS LITERALLY

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.300
ONE FOOT FROM WHERE THEY HAD

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:11.867
ORIGINALLY PLANNED YOU ALSO

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:13.502
SHOULD TRUST THEM WHEN THEY HAVE

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:15.237
THE MOST ADVANCED SENSING

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:15.838
EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD. ALL

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.339
AROUND THIS PLANET AND SAY THAT

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:18.440
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:21.577
OF US HEATING UP OUR CLIMATE.

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.213
AND SO ALL OF THE ALL OF US.

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:25.214
WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SEE THE

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.582
COST THE FINANCIAL COSTS

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:29.451
ASSOCIATED. WITH THESE CHANGES.

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:30.853
NEEDS TO REMEMBER THAT EVERY

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:33.122
TIME THEY TALK ABOUT. ANYTHING

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:34.657
THAT WE DO FOR RESILIENCY OR TO

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.392
COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BEING TOO

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.427
EXPENSIVE. BECAUSE THE COST OF

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.195
DOING NOTHING OR CONTINUING AS

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:42.531
WE ARE IT'S ASTRONOMICAL AND

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:44.166
IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE SO

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:45.501
THAT'S MY COMMENT FIRST.

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.102
SECONDLY I WANT TO GO BACK TO

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:48.604
SOMETHING THAT THE SECRETARY I

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:49.938
THINK HE MAY HAVE REFERENCE WHEN

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.707
HE TALKED ABOUT LEGISLATION. MY

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:54.076
BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND SIX

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:56.412
OH SIX. WHICH MOVED US AWAY FROM

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:57.579
DROUGHT PLANNING INTO EFFICIENCY

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:59.348
AWAY FROM CONSERVATION AND MORE

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:01.016
TOWARDS INVESTING IN EFFICIENCY.

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:03.786
AND MY QUESTION IS WHETHER. THE

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:05.621
DO YOU HAVE YOU ARE IN THE STATE

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:06.755

WE NEED TO DO. WORK TO QUALIFY

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:16.198
THOSE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.100
WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE IN THIS

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.602
BUDGET TO. REALLY GIVE OUR

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:22.304

NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:26.909
AS EFFICIENT AS WE CAN SO THAT

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.110
WE'RE NOT CONSTANTLY IN THIS.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.212
BILL OF TELLING EVERYBODY TO CUT

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:31.580
BACK WHEN IT FOR MORE EFFICIENT

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:33.182
WE HAVE MORE WHAT MORE WATER TO

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:34.750
USE FOR THE THINGS WE REALLY

CONSERVATION AS A WAY OF LIFE-

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.479
PRESS IN BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:38.914
WORKING TO GET AWAY FROM HIS

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:40.549
TEMPORARY CHANGES IN WATER USE

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:43.552
AND MORE TOWARD. DURABLE WATER

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.320
EFFICIENCY. ULTIMATELY WHAT WE

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:46.588
WANT EVERYBODY TO DO IN

CALIFORNIA IS B. AS EFFICIENT

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:49.858
WITH WATER AS WE ARE WITH

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:52.728
ENERGY. YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.463

MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT. WE NEED

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:03.705
TO BECOME MORE WATER EFFICIENT

CONTINUE TO PUT TOGETHER- OUR

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.259
OUTDOOR WATER USE EFFICIENCY

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:27.462
STANDARDS- AS YOU KNOW- THIS IS

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:30.132
A- COMPLEX ARE PIECE OF

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:33.669
LEGISLATION THAT- WAS MEANT TO-

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:36.572
SET SOME STANDARDS- IN MULTIPLE

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:38.607
WAYS ONE FOR INDOOR. ONE FOR

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:41.009
OUTDOOR BUT THEN ALSO- PROVIDE

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.045
WATER DISTRICTS WITH MAXIMUM

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:45.214
FLEXIBILITY TO WORK BETWEEN

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.816
THOSE TO MEET AN OVERALL BUDGET-

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:51.920

TERMS OF THE OUTSOURCING- ONE OF

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:56.592
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LEARNING-

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.294
IS THAT. THERE ARE SOME- START

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:01.964
SIMILARITIES TO SIGMA IN THAT-

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.199
WE DO HAVE A NEED TO COLLECT

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:06.802
DATA ACTUALLY AS WE GO THAT

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.171
INFORMS WATER USE EFFICIENCY

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.306
EFFICIENCY STRATEGIES SO YOU

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:15.777
WILL SEE IN- ARE. BUDGET FOR- A

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.279
FUNDING FOR CONSERVATION

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.747
PROGRAMS WE DO HAVE A FIVE

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:21.450
MILLION DOLLAR- THAT SORT OF SET

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:23.118
ASIDE IF YOU WILL FOR THE

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.487
DEPARTMENT TO DO ADDITIONAL

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:28.824
MAPPING- TO REALLY UNDERSTAND-

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.125
ON SOME OF THESE LANDSCAPE

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.827
ISSUES PARTICULARLY AS IT

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:33.595
PERTAINS TO. COMMERCIAL AND

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:36.331
INDUSTRIAL USES WHERE I THINK WE

01:15:36.398 --> 01:15:36.832
THINK THERE'S SOME REAL

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:40.469
OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING DOWN- OR

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:43.105
TO IMPROVE WATER USE EFFICIENCY-

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.740
ACROSS THE BOARD IN CALIFORNIA

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.942
AND THAT'S INFORMATION THAT WE

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:50.512
YOU KNOW WE- NEED TO DEVELOP- AS

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:52.848
WE MOVE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:56.585
NEW STANDARDS- THAT MAY IN FACT-

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:58.387
TRIGGERING NEED FOR ADDITIONAL

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:00.622
RESOURCES ONCE WE GET MORE

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:02.624
DEEPLY INTO- INTO ACTUAL

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:05.794
IMPLEMENTATION- BOTH OF OUR-

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:08.030
APPROACHES I THINK TOWARDS.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:08.964
INDOOR ARE INDOOR

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:11.667
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE PROVIDED

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:13.402
TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT ARMOR

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:15.704
OUTDOOR RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WE

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:18.173
WILL PROVIDE TO THE WATER BOARD

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.575
HAVE KIND OF A TO A STUDENT THAT

01:16:20.642 --> 01:16:23.145
TWO STEP APPROACH ONE IS AN

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:25.814
INTERIM EFFICIENCIES. AND THE

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:27.683
TWENTY FIVE AND THEN A NEW

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:33.121
STANDARD. IN TWENTY THIRTY TO

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:36.258
HELP WATER- REALLY MAKE A PRETTY

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:38.660
SICK. EVENTS TO OPTUM ALL

01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:40.862
THERE'S MORE EFFICIENT- AS WE

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:44.433
SAY- THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL. TO

01:16:44.499 --> 01:16:46.168
ACT IMPLEMENT THOSE- NEW

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:48.437
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS- WE WILL

BUDGET FOR STORAGE IN A WHAT

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:42.858
POINT EVER GOING TO RECOGNIZE

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:44.593

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.586
SMART STORAGE IS IMPORTANT I'M

BY SMART STORAGE CERTAINLY WE

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:15.957
MEAN UNDERGROUND STORAGE WE KNOW

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:18.226
WE HAVE A LOT OF CAPACITY IN OUR

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:20.662
UNDERGROUND AQUIFERS. WE NEED TO

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.998
DO MORE TO GET DEBATE THESE

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:25.767
WINTER RAINS THIS WINTER STORM

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:27.903
WHAT FLOWS UNDERGROUND. AND AS I

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:29.671
MENTIONED WE HAVE THIRTY MILLION

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:31.039
DOLLARS PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:33.008
TO HELP LOCAL AGENCIES DO THAT

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:36.144
WE HAVE MILLIONS OF ACRE FEET OF

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:37.345
CAPACITY OUR IN OUR UNDERGROUND

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:39.414
WATER BASINS AND WE KNOW WE NEED

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:41.650
TO RECHARGE THEM TO IMPLEMENT-

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:44.152
SIGMA SO. BUT MY PERSPECTIVE

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:46.188
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE NO BRAINER.

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.589
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN A LOT

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:48.857
OF PEOPLE REALIZE BECAUSE WE

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:50.926
NEED TO ENABLE OR THE LOCALS

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.761
NEED TO DO THIS RECHARGE IN WAYS

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:55.030
THAT DON'T. IMPAIR WATER RIGHTS

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.798
OF OTHER WATER USERS SO THERE IS

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:59.000
A WATER RIGHT PROCESS THAT CAN

01:18:59.067 --> 01:18:59.935
BE COMPLICATED BUT- THE WATER

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:01.536
BOARD'S DONE A GREAT JOB WITH

01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:02.671
THE W. R. OF TRYING TO

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.706
STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. I IN

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:06.241
ADDITION TO THE FUNDING SO

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:07.843
UNDERGROUND STORAGE IS IMPORTANT

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:10.112
AS IT IS REGIONAL STORAGE ONE OF

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:11.413
THE REASONS WHY GREATER LOS

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.583
ANGELES. IS A LOT MORE DROUGHT

01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:16.251
RESILIENT THAN IT WAS TWENTY

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:18.019

BELIEVE WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:26.228
REGIONAL RESERVOIR IN THAT AREA

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:29.030

AND THEN ALSO I WOULD MENTION

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:34.970
THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.538
ALLOCATING OVER TWO BILLION

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:38.573

THAT TASK REGISTRY OF THREE

01:52:07.987 --> 01:52:10.457
THOUSAND. WE GO BACK TO THE SAME

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:12.892

YEAR SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:25.472
AT YOU KNOW DATA A YEAR OLD. WE

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:28.041
HAVE A STAFF PERSON WHOSE SOLE

01:52:28.108 --> 01:52:30.143
JOB IS MANAGING THIS INFORMATION

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:32.612
ON OUR AUTOMATED SYSTEM ENGAGING

01:52:32.679 --> 01:52:34.881
WITH OUR ENTERPRISE SOME OF THE

01:52:34.948 --> 01:52:37.517
THINGS WE SEE IN THE COMPARATIVE

01:52:37.584 --> 01:52:43.957
ANALYSIS. IS THAT- WE SEE MOSTLY

01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:47.093
UP A SLATE- DECREASE IN OUR

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.963
CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS SO A

01:52:50.029 --> 01:52:52.098
SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE GAS. WE

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:53.800
THINK THAT COULD BE ATTRIBUTABLE

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:56.169
JUST TO THE UNIQUENESS OF THE

01:52:56.236 --> 01:52:57.904
LAST YEAR AROUND THE PANDEMIC.

01:52:57.971 --> 01:53:00.340
THE GAP ACTUALLY GREW THE MOST

01:53:00.406 --> 01:53:02.709
IN OUR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH

01:53:02.775 --> 01:53:05.678
SERVICE AREA AND WE THINK THAT

01:53:05.745 --> 01:53:07.213
IT IS IN PART POTENTIALLY

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.848
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE OUTREACH

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:11.918
WORK WE DO REST ON VOLUNTEERS.

01:53:11.985 --> 01:53:14.487
AND KIND OF THE ABILITY TO USE A

01:53:14.554 --> 01:53:16.356
VOLUNTEER BASE LAST YEAR WAS

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:17.924
COMPROMISED OR CHALLENGE BECAUSE

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:20.426
OF THE DYNAMICS AROUND THE

01:53:20.493 --> 01:53:22.095
PANDEMIC. WE DO SEE A SLIGHT

01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:24.230
INCREASE MEETING OUR SERVICE

01:53:24.297 --> 01:53:26.699
LEVEL WENT UP. AND THE GAP

01:53:26.766 --> 01:53:29.335
SHRUNK A TOUCH OVER THE SPECIES

01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:30.937
HABITAT CONSERVATION WORLD AND

01:53:31.004 --> 01:53:33.239
NOT MY ANALYSIS MY GUESS ON THAT

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:35.508
WILL BE. IMPOSED IN PART IT'S

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:24.717
THE EXPONENTIAL INCREASE OF FEES

01:55:24.784 --> 01:55:28.021
NECESSARY TO KIND OF MATCH UP

01:55:28.087 --> 01:55:29.055
MISSION AND CURRENT. SO I THINK

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:31.024
THIS PROCESS IS REALLY

01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:34.027
REPEATEDLY ILLUSTRATED. TO SOLVE

01:55:34.093 --> 01:55:35.395
THIS PROBLEM PERMANENTLY

01:55:35.461 --> 01:55:37.196
REQUIRES THINKING THROUGH WHAT'S

01:55:37.263 --> 01:55:40.166
AN ADDITIVE LONG RUN SUSTAINABLE

01:55:40.233 --> 01:55:43.269
FUND SOURCE TO DEAL WITH SOME OF

01:55:43.336 --> 01:55:44.537
THESE MISMATCHES. AND ON THAT

01:55:44.604 --> 01:55:48.574
FRONT CHAD NO- YOUR ATTENTION

01:55:50.476 --> 01:55:52.278
SIDE I JUST GOT A WITH KNOWLEDGE

01:55:52.345 --> 01:55:53.513
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:55:53.579 --> 01:55:55.515
CONTINUING TO EVALUATE

01:55:55.581 --> 01:55:57.216
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING OPTIONS TO

01:55:57.283 --> 01:56:00.987
ADDRESS WHAT WE SEE IS THE GAP

01:56:01.054 --> 01:56:02.622
AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ALSO

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:04.891
CONTINUING TO EXPLORE WAYS TO

01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:06.592
ADVANCE EFFICIENCIES AND

01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:09.429
MAXIMIZE EXISTING RESOURCES WHAT

01:56:09.495 --> 01:56:11.497
HAPPENED LAST YEAR ON THE THIRTY

THE PROPOSALS FIRST WE HAVE-

01:57:11.457 --> 01:57:14.093
PROPOSAL FOR UP MODEST SOME

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:16.062
MIGHT THINK OF EIGHT HUNDRED TEN

01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:17.897
THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO COMPLETE A

01:57:17.964 --> 01:57:20.600
TECHNOLOGY PROJECT TO GET MORE

01:57:20.666 --> 01:57:23.936
PEOPLE OUTDOORS AND THIS IS TO

01:57:24.003 --> 01:57:26.406
EARN OUR FISHING LICENSES FROM

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:30.042
CALENDAR YEAR. TWO EIGHT THREE

01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:31.711
HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS FROM

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:33.646
DATE OF PURCHASE OPPORTUNITIES

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:35.782
SO HISTORICALLY YOU BY YOUR

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:38.084
FISHING LICENSE IN THE MOMENT

01:57:38.151 --> 01:57:40.520
YOU BUY IT IT'S VALID FOR

01:57:40.586 --> 01:57:41.921
WHATEVER THE REMAINDER OF THE

DECIDE TO GO FISHING IN OCTOBER

01:57:48.928 --> 01:57:49.996
AND YOU BY THEN YOU ONLY GET A

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:51.798
COUPLE OF MONTHS. WE BELIEVE

01:57:51.864 --> 01:57:52.965
THAT IF WE TRANSITION THAT TO. A

01:57:53.032 --> 01:57:54.734
PROGRAM THAT OTHER STATES ARE

01:57:54.801 --> 01:57:56.769
DOING FROM THE MOMENT YOU

01:57:56.836 --> 01:57:59.238
PURCHASE IT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY

01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:00.740
FIVE DAYS BOARD IT'S VALID WE

01:58:00.807 --> 01:58:03.409
MAY SEE MORE PEOPLE BUY LICENSES

01:58:03.476 --> 01:58:05.378
WHICH WILL INCREASE OUR REVENUE.

01:58:05.445 --> 01:58:07.346
IN THE LONG RUN. THE OTHER

01:58:07.413 --> 01:58:11.717
CHANGE WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL IS-

01:58:11.784 --> 01:58:14.787
TO GIVE A DISCOUNT TO SENIORS

01:58:14.854 --> 01:58:16.789
FOR THEIR FISHING LICENSES NOW

01:58:16.856 --> 01:58:19.158
THIS ASPECT COULD AFFECT OUR

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:21.227
REVENUE IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE

01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:24.063
WE DON'T YET KNOW. WHAT SENIORS

01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:25.164
WILL AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE

01:58:25.231 --> 01:58:27.967
DISCOUNT BUT IT'S EQUALLY TRUE

01:58:28.034 --> 01:58:29.535
THAT DISCOUNT COULD MOTIVATE

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:32.338
MORE SENIORS WHICH I THINK IS TO

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:34.073
FIND A SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER SO A

01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:34.941
LOT OF GOOD FISHING TIME. FROM

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:37.210
SIXTY FIVE ON. THE BOTTOM MORE

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:39.512
LICENSES AND WE COULD SEE MORE

01:58:39.579 --> 01:58:41.814
REVENUE. SO THE EIGHT HUNDRED

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:43.082
THOUSAND ALLOWS US TO COMPLETE

01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:44.951
SOME OF THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

01:58:45.017 --> 01:58:46.652
TECHNOLOGY WORK AND GET THIS

01:58:46.719 --> 01:58:47.553
AUTOMATED WITHIN OUR LICENSE

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.622
AUTOMATION SYSTEM. WHAT'S THE

01:58:49.689 --> 01:58:51.123
NEXUS THE SERVICE BASED

01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:53.893
BUDGETING. THIS IS ACTUALLY

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:56.896
MANDATED BY THE BILL ASSEMBLY

01:58:56.963 --> 01:59:00.466

01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:01.067
A PROPOSAL TO FUND THE

01:59:01.133 --> 01:59:03.503
DEPARTMENT WORK TO AVOID AN

01:59:03.569 --> 01:59:05.605
UNFUNDED MANDATE AND THE SERVICE

01:59:05.671 --> 01:59:06.939
BASED BUDGETING PROCESS

01:59:07.006 --> 01:59:09.842
IDENTIFIED LEGISLATIVE MANDATES

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:12.178
BOOK THE LACK OF FUNDING TO

01:59:12.245 --> 01:59:14.914
MATCH WITH THE MANDATE. A REASON

01:59:14.981 --> 01:59:16.883
WHY WE GET A GAP SALUTE THE

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:19.285
NEXUS IN MY VIEW IS FINDING A

01:59:19.352 --> 01:59:21.921
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE SAME IS TRUE

01:59:21.988 --> 01:59:23.489
FOR THE NEXT BUDGET PROPOSAL ON

01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:27.293
THIS ISSUE. SENATE BILL EIGHTY

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.195
CREATES A NEW ENDEAVOR FOR THE

01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:30.696
DEPARTMENT TO DO AVARIETY OF

01:59:30.763 --> 01:59:34.400
THINGS IMPROVE OUR SAMPLING OF

CRAB. IT A CERTAIN TIME OF YEAR.

01:59:37.537 --> 01:59:39.705
HE ENGAGE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

PUBLIC HEALTH TO CREATE AN OF

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:44.110
THIS ARRAY SHOULD PROGRAM WHICH

01:59:44.176 --> 01:59:46.746
MEANS THAT CRABBERS CAN

01:59:46.812 --> 01:59:49.849
POTENTIALLY- CLEAN THE CRAP IN A

01:59:49.916 --> 01:59:52.385
WAY THAT REDUCES THE POTENTIAL

01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:55.488
RISK AROUND TOXINS IN THE- NUTS

01:59:55.555 --> 01:59:58.824
OF THE CRAB. YET STILL SAIL CELL

FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION BUT

02:00:00.393 --> 02:00:02.628
BEATING THE CRAP. SO THIS IS A

02:00:02.695 --> 02:00:04.830
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE THE REQUEST

02:00:04.897 --> 02:00:08.467

SAMPLING AND OTHER CRAP PROGRAM

02:00:17.243 --> 02:00:19.145
ELEMENTS. MANY OF THAT THAT'S

02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:23.015
WHY GENERAL FUND AND WHY NOT FEE

02:00:23.082 --> 02:00:23.683
COMMERCIAL FISHING. WE TRIED TO

02:00:23.749 --> 02:00:25.451
FEED COMMERCIAL FISHING AT A

02:00:25.518 --> 02:00:27.353
RATE THAT RECEIVED A LOT OF

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:29.322
RESISTANCE THE LEGISLATURE IN

02:00:29.388 --> 02:00:30.990
THE ADMINISTRATION ULTIMATELY

02:00:31.057 --> 02:00:34.293
ADOPTED US ALL THE INCREASE. BUT

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:36.162
THERE ARE PUBLIC BENEFITS IN

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:38.464
THIS SPACE AS WELL. YEAH

02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:41.233
DESTABILISE PORTS ACROSS OUR

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.802
RURAL COMMUNITIES ON THE COAST

02:00:42.868 --> 02:00:45.838
CLIMATE CHANGE IS INCREASING THE

02:00:45.905 --> 02:00:47.673
RICH TO OUR VALUABLE COMMERCIAL

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:50.242
FISHERIES WERE FACING JOB LOSSES

02:00:50.309 --> 02:00:53.446
AND REGIONAL DEPRESSION. AND IF

02:00:53.512 --> 02:00:54.780
WE DON'T AKE THE KIND OF STEPS

02:00:54.847 --> 02:00:56.716
REQUIRED BY THIS BILL IT'S

02:00:56.782 --> 02:00:58.651
POSSIBLE WE'LL SEE A REDUCTION

02:00:58.718 --> 02:01:00.219
OF GOOD CLEAN SEAFOOD ON THE

02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:02.121
PLATES FOR CALIFORNIANS TO ENJOY

02:01:02.188 --> 02:01:04.457
SO THERE'S A LOT OF BROAD PUBLIC

02:01:04.523 --> 02:01:05.625
BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM.

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:07.059
THAT'S THE SECOND PROPOSAL THE

02:01:07.126 --> 02:01:10.129

AND TURTLES. SO I THINK MOST

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:23.709
PEOPLE REALIZE NOW WE HAVE A

02:01:23.776 --> 02:01:27.113
CONFLUENCE OF. A STANDING EVENTS

ALONG OUR COAST HAS THAT

02:01:39.225 --> 02:01:42.495
MIGRATION PATH IS ALTERING THESE

FULLY. IN HERE WE HAVE ABOUT

02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:52.465
THIRTY VESSELS THAT ARE NON LAW

02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:55.367
ENFORCEMENT VESSELS THAT WE USE

02:02:55.434 --> 02:02:56.736
AS THE BACKBONE FOR OUR

02:02:56.802 --> 02:02:58.304
SCIENTIFIC MONITORING AROUND THE

02:02:58.370 --> 02:03:01.707
STATE. IN WITHIN THE SAN JOAQUIN

SACRAMENTO DELTA ESTUARY

02:03:03.275 --> 02:03:05.578
ENVIRONMENT WE TOOK A LOOK AT

02:03:05.644 --> 02:03:07.680
OUR AGING VESSEL FLEET WE LOOKED

02:03:07.747 --> 02:03:11.417
AT TWELVE VESSELS AND OF THOSE

02:03:11.484 --> 02:03:13.719
TWELVE WE CONCLUDED FIVE OF THEM

02:03:13.786 --> 02:03:15.821
ARE AT MOST RISK OF JUST THEY'RE

02:03:15.888 --> 02:03:17.323
TAKING TOO MUCH MAINTENANCE

02:03:17.389 --> 02:03:20.326
TIME. THEY'RE OUTDATED AND WE'RE

02:03:20.392 --> 02:03:22.795
GONNA HAVE TO RETIRE THEM SO

02:03:22.862 --> 02:03:24.663
THESE VESSELS SUPPORT THE

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:27.566
MONITORING- OF- LEGALLY

02:03:27.633 --> 02:03:30.069
PROTECTED AND RECREATIONAL USE

02:03:30.136 --> 02:03:33.806
FISH. THEY RELATE TO ABOUT FIFTY

02:03:33.873 --> 02:03:37.510
THREE SURVEYS WE DO- EACH YEAR

02:03:37.576 --> 02:03:39.945
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MONITORING

02:03:40.012 --> 02:03:43.716
TRIPS WE NEED TO MODERNIZE THIS

02:03:43.783 --> 02:03:44.850
PART OF OUR SCIENTIFIC VESSEL

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:48.988
FLEET. SO THE WHALE PROPOSAL IS

02:03:49.054 --> 02:03:51.223
NEXUS TO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING

02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:53.592
IS OUR GREATEST GAP IS

02:03:53.659 --> 02:03:55.094
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SPECIES

02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:58.864
CONSERVATION. BROUGHT BENEFIT TO

02:03:58.931 --> 02:04:00.232
SAVING WHALES IN THE OCEAN AND

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:03.135
ENSURING A SUSTAINABLE DUNGEON

02:04:03.202 --> 02:04:04.870
THIS CRAP FISHERY IN CALIFORNIA

02:04:04.937 --> 02:04:07.673
. THE VESSEL PROPOSAL THE FOURTH

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:09.241
IT'S NEXUS TO SERVICE BASED

02:04:09.308 --> 02:04:11.210
BUDGETING YOU CAN MAKE A ONE

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:12.645
TIME CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN YOUR

02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:14.513
INFRASTRUCTURE AND GAINED GREAT

02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:16.615
EFFICIENCIES AND CONVERTING YOUR

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:20.653
GAP- MEMBER SMITH I CAN'T SEE

02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:22.721
WHETHER CHAIR BLOOMS COME BACK

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:24.523
BUT THAT'S MY STORY ON ISSUE SIX

02:04:24.590 --> 02:04:26.025
AND I'M BACK. IF THERE'S ANY

02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:28.160
QUESTIONS I'M BACK- AND I DO

02:04:28.227 --> 02:04:30.830
HAVE A QUESTION- THAT'S ABOUT

02:04:30.896 --> 02:04:32.464
SPECIES CONSERVATION BUT FIRST I

02:04:32.531 --> 02:04:35.267
WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON- REALLY

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:37.203
EMBRACING SERVICE BASED

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:40.840
BUDGETING- I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:04:40.906 --> 02:04:41.607
THAT I KNOW THE COMMITTEE

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:45.110
APPRECIATE THAT- AND I THINK IT-

02:04:45.177 --> 02:04:46.979
WE'RE SEEING FROM YOUR REPORTS.

02:04:47.046 --> 02:04:49.748
THAT IT'S REALLY PAYING OFF AND

02:04:49.815 --> 02:04:52.785
THE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL SO MY

02:04:52.852 --> 02:04:53.786
QUESTION ABOUT SPECIES

02:04:53.853 --> 02:04:57.623
CONSERVATION HAS TO DO WITH

02:04:57.690 --> 02:04:58.824
BLACK BEARS SOME. DO WE KNOW HOW

02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:01.694
MANY THERE ARE IN THE STATE. HAS

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:03.395
THERE BEEN A STATEWIDE COUNTLESS

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:05.965
SO WHEN WAS THAT- HOW DO YOU

02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:07.933
PERFORMANCE STATEWIDE COUNT AND

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.668
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THE

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:12.504
APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF HUNTING

02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:15.174
PERMITS FOR THE SPECIES. WE DO

02:05:15.241 --> 02:05:17.409
ALL OF THOSE THINGS USING BEST

02:05:17.476 --> 02:05:20.379
AVAILABLE SCIENCE. AND DECADES

02:05:20.446 --> 02:05:21.547
OF LEADERSHIP AND WILDLIFE

02:05:21.614 --> 02:05:23.649
MANAGEMENT. SO WE HAVE AN

02:05:23.716 --> 02:05:26.185
ESTIMATE. AND LET ME TELL YOU

02:05:26.252 --> 02:05:28.721
HOW WE GET TO THAT ESTIMATE

02:05:28.787 --> 02:05:31.023
CHAIR SO. YOU KNOW WE HAVE

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:31.724
SCIENTISTS- ACROSS THE

02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:34.793
DEPARTMENT WE MIGHT HAVE AS MANY

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:36.395
STATE SCIENTIST AS ANY OTHER

02:05:36.462 --> 02:05:38.864
DEPARTMENT AND STATE SERVICE

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:41.367
PERHAPS MORE. THESE ARE TRAINED

02:05:41.433 --> 02:05:43.569
BIOLOGIST- COMING OUT OF

02:05:43.636 --> 02:05:45.237
UNIVERSITIES AND YOU KNOW WORK

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:47.840
EXPERIENCE ELSEWHERE. AND THEY

02:05:47.907 --> 02:05:49.875
DO THIS ACROSS ALL THE ANIMALS

02:05:49.942 --> 02:05:52.611
AND PLANTS WE MANAGE SO IT'S NOT

02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:55.481
LIMITED THE BEARS. SAGE GROUSE

02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:58.817
HALIBUT- YOUR WHALES SHARKS SO

02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:01.620
ON SO FORTH. THIS IS A COMPLEX

02:06:01.687 --> 02:06:03.856
SPACE FOR THE SCIENTIST THERE

02:06:03.923 --> 02:06:05.591
ARE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN

02:06:05.658 --> 02:06:07.726
DETERMINE A POPULATION. AND

02:06:07.793 --> 02:06:10.162
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THE

02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:11.130
BIOLOGIST IS CALCULATING

02:06:11.196 --> 02:06:14.233
ECOSYSTEM ERRAIN TO SPECIES

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.035
YOU'RE TRYING TO ESTIMATE.

02:06:16.101 --> 02:06:20.673
WHETHER COST AND THE ASSESSMENTS

02:06:20.739 --> 02:06:23.142
TYPICALLY USE SOME CORE DATA

02:06:23.208 --> 02:06:26.011
STREAMS ONE IS HARVEST WHICH IS

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:27.613
A EUPHEMISM FOR WHAT KIND OF

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:30.749
LEGAL TECH THE USE OF AN ANIMAL

02:06:30.816 --> 02:06:32.451
OR A PLANT. ABUNDANCE SO YOU'RE

02:06:32.518 --> 02:06:33.752
LOOKING ACROSS THE POPULATIONS

02:06:33.819 --> 02:06:36.355
RANGING DISTRIBUTION ANY DATA

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:39.558
STREAMS. AND TYPICALLY STANDARD

02:06:39.625 --> 02:06:43.862
PRACTICE ALL THAT FEEDS INTO UP

02:06:43.929 --> 02:06:45.731
SOME MATHEMATICAL MODEL. IN THE

02:06:45.798 --> 02:06:48.567
MODEL THEN PRODUCES ESTIMATES

02:06:48.634 --> 02:06:51.070
THAT ALLOWS THE MANAGERS TO MAKE

02:06:51.136 --> 02:06:53.238
DECISIONS WITHIN OUT WE'RE

02:06:53.305 --> 02:06:55.841
SEEING THAT POPULATION STABILITY

02:06:55.908 --> 02:06:57.843
INSTABILITY. ERTZ FEATURES

02:06:57.910 --> 02:07:02.648
PLANTS WE DON'T DO A CENSUS IT'S

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:05.584
NOT ANALOGOUS TO SAY THE CENSUS

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:07.653
BUREAU TRYING TO COUNT EVERY

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.955
CITIZEN THAT IS NOT STANDARD

02:07:10.022 --> 02:07:12.057
PRACTICE FOR ANY STATE OR

02:07:12.124 --> 02:07:14.259
FEDERAL WILDLIFE AGENCY. SO WE

02:07:14.326 --> 02:07:17.296
DON'T LITERALLY SEEK TO TELL

02:07:17.363 --> 02:07:19.264
EACH INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL ON A

02:07:19.331 --> 02:07:23.035
POPULATION- THERE ARE SOME

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:26.872
PLACES- HERE ON THE EAST SIDE OF

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:29.475
THE SIERRA SAGE GROUSE WE'RE

02:07:29.541 --> 02:07:31.343
WE'RE ABLE TO DO AERIAL

02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:33.579
SURVEILLANCE. AND THE SPECIES

02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:35.981
LIFE'S STRATEGY THE TEND TO

02:07:36.048 --> 02:07:38.317
CONGREGATE IN OPEN SPACES AND

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:41.820
YOU CAN COUNT FROM THE AIR THAT

02:07:41.887 --> 02:07:42.921
BECOMES A DATA STREAM FOR A

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:45.591
MODEL. BUT WITH THE BEARS. WE

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:47.026
DON'T THINK THERE'S A SIMPLE WAY

02:07:47.092 --> 02:07:48.861
TO DO IT TRUE CENSUS ON EVERY

02:07:48.927 --> 02:07:50.763
SINGLE PAYER THEY MOVE PLACE TO

02:07:50.829 --> 02:07:53.432
PLACE. THEY HIDE THEY HIBERNATE

02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:56.468
TO CAMOUFLAGE SO IT'S NOT

02:07:56.535 --> 02:07:58.570
LITERALLY THE CASE WE COUNT. AT

02:07:58.637 --> 02:08:00.572
THE STATE WIDE POPULATION FOR

02:08:00.639 --> 02:08:02.341
BEARS AND I WOULD SUBMIT IF

02:08:02.408 --> 02:08:04.176
THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO HEAD.

02:08:04.243 --> 02:08:07.646
ROUTE WE MAY FIND OUT- THE

02:08:07.713 --> 02:08:09.615
RESOURCES TO LITERALLY DO THAT

02:08:09.681 --> 02:08:11.150
ARE PRETTY ASTRONOMICAL LIKE

02:08:11.216 --> 02:08:14.420
ADDICTS LOST AND STAFF LABOR

02:08:14.486 --> 02:08:16.355
PERSON OUR LEVEL. SO HERE'S HOW

02:08:16.422 --> 02:08:19.391
WE DO IT WITH BEARS. WE TAKE

02:08:19.458 --> 02:08:22.094
THAT INFORMATION AND WE

02:08:22.161 --> 02:08:27.466
CALCULATE IT FROM WHAT HUNTERS

02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:29.935
REPORT EACH SEASON. THE HUNTER

02:08:30.002 --> 02:08:32.304
OF THE BEARS REQUIRED TO BRING

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:34.440
TO BEAR BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT.

02:08:34.506 --> 02:08:38.544
AND WE TAKE A PREMOLAR TOOTH OUT

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:41.146
OF THE BEAR AND YOU CAN DO A LOT

02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:42.815
OF SCIENTIFIC WORK BUT IT'S

02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:46.118
CREDIBLE AND PRECISE FROM THAT.

02:08:46.185 --> 02:08:49.922
LOCUSTS DESCEND ON EACH AND SEX

02:08:49.988 --> 02:08:51.957
AT THAT MOMENT OF THAT

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:53.492
PARTICULAR BEAR. AND THEN WE

02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:55.394
AGGREGATE THAT INFORMATION FROM

02:08:55.461 --> 02:08:58.130
THE TOOTH ANALYSIS. WE TAKE THE

02:08:58.197 --> 02:09:01.433
AGGREGATION AND WE PLUG IT INTO

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.202
A MODEL AND THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS

02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:05.571
US TO PRODUCE AN ANNUAL BEAR

02:09:05.637 --> 02:09:07.973
POPULATION DYNAMICS. NOW MORE

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.975
RECENTLY WE'VE BEGUN TO AUGMENT

02:09:10.042 --> 02:09:12.211
THAT WITH LOCALIZED VERY

02:09:12.277 --> 02:09:16.181
SPECIFIC KIND OF GPS DRIVEN WORK

02:09:16.248 --> 02:09:18.383
ON REGIONAL BEAR POPULATIONS

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:20.519
WERE CLOSE TO COMPLETING. AN

02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:22.287
ASSESSMENT ON THE EAST SIDE AND

02:09:22.354 --> 02:09:24.256
MODOC COUNTY THERE WILL BE JUST

02:09:24.323 --> 02:09:26.825
LOOKING AT THE BEARS AND MONO

02:09:26.892 --> 02:09:28.560
USING KIND OF GPS DATA. WE'RE

02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:31.997
TAKING THOSE STREAMS AND WE'RE

02:09:32.064 --> 02:09:33.198
PUTTING THEM INTO OUR STANDARD

02:09:33.265 --> 02:09:35.801
MODEL APPROACH AND WE COME UP

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:37.169
WITH AN ESTIMATE. WE THINK

02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:39.771
THAT'S PRETTY CREDIBLE. IN WHAT

02:09:39.838 --> 02:09:41.473
WE SEE RIGHT NOW USING THAT

02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:44.109
EFFORT IS WE ESTIMATE- BLACK

02:09:44.176 --> 02:09:46.145
BEAR POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA IS

02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:49.248
ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND. THE MOST

02:09:49.314 --> 02:09:50.749
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT ESTIMATE

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:53.285
IS REALLY TO LOOK BACKWARDS AND

02:09:53.352 --> 02:09:54.720
GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT ESTIMATE

02:09:54.786 --> 02:09:58.123
OF FORTY THOUSAND. IT'S WITHIN A

02:09:58.190 --> 02:09:59.925
PRETTY STABLE POPULATION TREND

02:09:59.992 --> 02:10:02.961
SO THE OVERALL POPULATION BASED

02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:04.997
ON OUR WORK IS NOT GOING DOWN.

02:10:05.063 --> 02:10:07.633
OUR STATE IS GOING UP BUT IT

02:10:07.699 --> 02:10:09.034
LOOKS PRETTY STABLE. SO WHEN YOU

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:10.536
GET TO AN ASSESSMENT AT THE

02:10:10.602 --> 02:10:13.739
BIOLOGIST LEVEL OF STABILITY.

02:10:13.805 --> 02:10:16.341
THAT'S REALLY WHEN YOU GET INTO-

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:18.177
CHAIR HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT.

02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:20.379
WHAT'S A SUSTAINABLE POTENTIAL

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:23.415
USE OF THE ANIMAL. SO UNLIKE

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:25.050
SOME OTHER DYNAMICS YOU FIVE

02:10:25.117 --> 02:10:27.786
DIGIT AND BOBCATS AND ELSEWHERE.

02:10:27.853 --> 02:10:30.989
PEOPLE ACTIVELY CLIENT BEAR FOR

02:10:31.056 --> 02:10:33.792
USE THERE'S CONSUMPTION AT A LOT

02:10:33.859 --> 02:10:36.228
OF THE BEAR PRODUCT IS USED. SO

02:10:36.295 --> 02:10:38.030
RIGHT NOW ALL THE WAY THE

02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:40.599
DEPARTMENT MAN JUST BEAR HUNTING

02:10:40.666 --> 02:10:43.936
IS COURSE YOU CAN'T USE DOGS THE

02:10:44.002 --> 02:10:45.137
LEGISLATURE IN THE DEPARTMENT

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:47.339
ARE COMMISSION WORK THROUGH THAT

02:10:47.406 --> 02:10:50.809
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. WE CAP. THE

02:10:50.876 --> 02:10:53.512
AMOUNT OF BEARS THAT CAN BE

02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:55.380
TAKEN EACH YEAR THROUGH HUNTING.

02:10:55.447 --> 02:10:58.116
BACK CAP AS IT IS AT SEVENTEEN

02:10:58.183 --> 02:11:01.954
HUNDRED. THAT NUMBER OF

02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:04.456
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED. REFLECTS

02:11:04.523 --> 02:11:06.425
PRETTY STANDARD SCIENTIFIC

02:11:06.491 --> 02:11:07.893
THINKING WITHIN WILDLIFE

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:10.095
MANAGEMENT SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:11.830
AT A POPULATION. THE SCIENTISTS

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:14.099
WILL TELL YOU 10% OF THE

02:11:14.166 --> 02:11:17.669
POPULATION IS A STANDARD THAT IS

02:11:17.736 --> 02:11:19.104
CONSIDERED AMONG WILDLIFE

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:21.573
MANAGERS WILL BE A CONSERVATIVE

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.942
KIND OF NUMBER FOR YOUR HUNTING

02:11:24.009 --> 02:11:26.211
IMPACT. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT

02:11:26.278 --> 02:11:29.047
THAT CURRENT CAP OF SEVENTEEN

02:11:29.114 --> 02:11:30.482
HUNDRED RELATIVE TO THAT 10%

02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:32.884
FIGURE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED IS

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:36.321
ABOUT FOUR POINT 25% OF THAT

02:11:36.388 --> 02:11:38.957
STABLE POPULATION. SO WHAT WELL

02:11:39.024 --> 02:11:41.159
BELOW WHAT ARE WILDLIFE

02:11:41.226 --> 02:11:42.928
SCIENTIST INDICATE IS KIND OF A

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:45.597
SUSTAINABILITY HARVEST LEVEL

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:47.366
WITHIN THE HUNTING CONTEXT BUT

02:11:47.432 --> 02:11:48.900
THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL AND THEN

02:11:48.967 --> 02:11:50.769
I'LL PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS WHAT

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:52.504
WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE

02:11:52.571 --> 02:11:54.973
YEARS IS ACTUALLY THAT WE'RE NOT

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:57.776
NEAR THAT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED

02:11:57.843 --> 02:12:00.145
LEVEL THE CAP IF YOU WILL. AND

02:12:00.212 --> 02:12:03.382
I'VE GOT IT IN MY NOTES HERE

02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:05.150
SOMEWHERE UP HERE IS. IN TWENTY

02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:05.817
TWENTY ONE SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:08.387
AT THAT DATA NOW. THE NUMBER OF

02:12:08.453 --> 02:12:13.525
BEARS HARVESTED WAS ACTUALLY.

02:12:13.592 --> 02:12:14.593
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.528
SIX SO WE'RE EVEN BELOW THE CAP.

02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:18.363
WHICH MEANS IF YOU'RE THINKING

02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:19.931
OF THAT 10% SUSTAINABILITY

02:12:19.998 --> 02:12:20.932
NUMBER. WILL PROBABLY MORE

02:12:20.999 --> 02:12:24.202
AROUND THE 3% NUMBER RELATIVE TO

02:12:24.269 --> 02:12:26.738

THAT'S A REAL EDUCATION THANK

02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:51.556

MY EDIFICATION- THAT TEN

02:13:54.693 --> 02:13:57.929
PERCENT. TO A FIGURE THAT'S

02:13:57.996 --> 02:14:00.499
ACROSS SPECIES OR THAT'S

02:14:00.565 --> 02:14:03.435
SPECIFIC TO BEAR. YEAH I THINK

02:14:03.502 --> 02:14:06.671
THAT THERE'S A- THE SPECIES

02:14:06.738 --> 02:14:08.306
INDIVIDUALISTIC NATURE AND

02:14:08.373 --> 02:14:10.742
THAT'S THE NUMBER I AYE MINOR

02:14:10.809 --> 02:14:12.978
THINGS WERE USING IMPAIR WHETHER

02:14:13.044 --> 02:14:14.913
IT'S UP OR DOWN FOR DIFFERENT. I

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:17.516
THINK IS TRUE AND RELATES TO

02:14:17.582 --> 02:14:21.052
WHAT OUR OUR- UNIONS AROUND ANY

02:14:21.119 --> 02:14:23.021
GIVEN POPULATIONS ABUNDANCE.

02:14:23.088 --> 02:14:24.756
LIKE WE'RE DEALING WITH SAGE

02:14:24.823 --> 02:14:26.625
GROUSE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS A

02:14:26.691 --> 02:14:29.461
FEDERALLY PROTECTED SPECIES BUT

02:14:29.528 --> 02:14:32.097
YOU CAN STILL HUNT SAGE GROUSE

02:14:32.164 --> 02:14:34.699
IN THE EASTERN SIERRA. AND THERE

02:14:34.766 --> 02:14:36.668
ARE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT HUNTING

02:14:36.735 --> 02:14:38.437
HARVEST LEVELS ANYWHERE NEAR

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:40.305
THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE POPULATION

02:14:40.372 --> 02:14:42.774
OF THE SPECIES IS MUCH LOWER SO

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:44.242
YOU DO HAVE TO TAILOR YOUR

02:14:44.309 --> 02:14:46.545
MANAGEMENT DECISION WITH THOSE

02:14:46.611 --> 02:14:49.014

COMMITTEE HEARING SO IF THIS

02:14:57.389 --> 02:14:59.357
SOMEHOW HAS BEEN COVERED AT- I

02:14:59.424 --> 02:15:01.560
HAVEN'T I'M INTERESTED IN THE

02:15:01.626 --> 02:15:04.830
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE-

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:07.332
WE'RE FINDING WITH GENERAL FUNDS

02:15:07.399 --> 02:15:09.401
AND THERE WAS- SOME TALK ABOUT

02:15:09.468 --> 02:15:12.003
WHILE AGO ABOUT INCREASING FEES.

02:15:12.070 --> 02:15:13.939
HOW TO HELP WITH A FUNDING- THE

02:15:14.005 --> 02:15:15.507
HAD A BIG FEE INCREASE AND

02:15:15.574 --> 02:15:17.209
THERE'S LOTS OF OPPOSITION TO

02:15:17.275 --> 02:15:19.010
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO REVISIT THE

02:15:19.077 --> 02:15:21.079
TOPIC THAT I BROUGHT UP- IN THE

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:23.915
PAST WHICH IS. TO HAVE A FEE AND

02:15:23.982 --> 02:15:26.451
THE HAVE- AT LEAST START TO HAVE

02:15:26.518 --> 02:15:29.087
A SMALLER INCREASE BUT MORE

02:15:29.154 --> 02:15:30.655
IMPORTANTLY TIE THAT SMALLER

02:15:30.722 --> 02:15:32.157
INCREASE TO THE CONSUMER PRICE

02:15:32.224 --> 02:15:34.326
INDEX IN SOME WAY SO THAT IT'S

02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:35.927
TOTALLY GOES UP TO TRY TO

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:37.596
DECREASE THE CHANCES THAT WE

02:15:37.662 --> 02:15:40.265
HAVE- THE DEFICIT SO I'M JUST.

02:15:40.332 --> 02:15:42.000
CURIOUS IS THERE- IS THE

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:45.036
DEPARTMENT CONSIDERING- LOWER-

02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:48.139
FEE INCREASE- RATHER THAN THE

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:50.175
LARGE ONE THAT- MET WITH SO MUCH

02:15:50.242 --> 02:15:53.044
OPPOSITION AND IF THE-

02:15:53.111 --> 02:15:54.112
DEPARTMENT IS CONSIDERING A

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:55.747
LOWER FEE INCREASE WOULD IT ALSO

02:15:55.814 --> 02:15:58.650
BE MATCHED WITH A- A WRITER FOR

02:15:58.717 --> 02:16:00.819
SOME KIND OF- CONSUMER PRICE

02:16:00.886 --> 02:16:05.957
INFLATION- ADDED TO IT. ASSEMBLY

02:16:06.024 --> 02:16:07.492
MEMBER MY ANSWERS KIND OF YES

02:16:07.559 --> 02:16:09.828
BUT AND HERE'S HERE'S THE BUT

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:12.898
PART. OF THE HOWEVER PARK- I

02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:17.369
PEOPLE APPROPRIATE SO. WE HAVE

02:16:17.435 --> 02:16:18.236
HUNDREDS OF FEES ACROSS THE

02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:21.306
DEPARTMENT WE CAN GET THERE SO

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:23.275
YOU MAY BE ASKING ABOUT ONE. AND

02:16:23.341 --> 02:16:25.243
I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO FEES

02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:26.778
ON COMMERCIAL FISHING BUT WE

02:16:26.845 --> 02:16:29.714
HAVE HUNDREDS THE WAY WE DO OIL

02:16:29.781 --> 02:16:32.317
SPILL RESPONSE IS WE HAVE FEES

ON THE PRODUCTION OF BARRELS OF

02:16:34.886 --> 02:16:37.122
OIL AT THE FACILITY. REPHRASE

02:16:37.188 --> 02:16:39.691
THAT RECENTLY WE HAD FEES ON

02:16:39.758 --> 02:16:41.893
PEOPLE WHO NEED PERMITS FOR

02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:44.496
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WE RAISE

PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HUNT AND FISH

02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:50.969
. SOME OF THOSE MORE RECENTLY

02:16:51.036 --> 02:16:54.139
HAVE. BECAUSE THE LEGISLATIVE

02:16:54.205 --> 02:16:57.142
WORK BEEN GIVEN ABILITY FOR US

02:16:57.208 --> 02:16:58.476

SAY WE- SOUGHT TO RAISE THEM TO

02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:14.593
EXPONENTIALLY HIGH. THE OUTCOME

02:17:14.659 --> 02:17:15.794
BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AND

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:17.662
ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH WAS A

02:17:17.729 --> 02:17:21.299
MODEST FEE INCREASE BUT I GOT TO

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:23.335
BE FRANK. A LOT OF OUR USER

02:17:23.401 --> 02:17:27.305
COMMUNITIES CANNOT FATHOM. THE

02:17:27.372 --> 02:17:30.008
COST OF WHAT THE FEE WOULD BE TO

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:32.143
TRULY ALIGN OUR MISSION AND OUR

02:17:32.210 --> 02:17:34.446
CURRENT SERVICE LEVEL SO MY

02:17:34.512 --> 02:17:36.581
PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT APARTMENT

02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:38.717
CAN'T FEED ITS WAY OUT OF A LOT

02:17:38.783 --> 02:17:41.186
OF THE PREDICAMENT WE'RE IN AND

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:44.155
THE BEST EXAMPLE IS. OUR WORK IN

02:17:44.222 --> 02:17:45.857
SPECIES CONSERVATION

02:17:45.924 --> 02:17:47.559
PARTICULARLY ENDANGERED SPECIES

02:17:47.626 --> 02:17:49.427
IS TO THE GENERAL BENEFIT OF THE

02:17:49.494 --> 02:17:52.230
PUBLIC. I MEAN WHAT WOULD BE A

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:53.431
FEE. CHARGE SOMEONE WHO SUBMITS

02:17:53.498 --> 02:17:55.934
A PETITION TO PROTECT AN ANIMAL

02:17:56.001 --> 02:17:58.637
UNDER THE STATE ESA OF THREE.

02:17:58.703 --> 02:18:00.372
MAGIC IT'S HARD TO CONTEMPLATE

02:18:00.438 --> 02:18:02.140
WHAT WOULD BE A VARIETY OF FEET

02:18:02.207 --> 02:18:04.876
SOURCES TO TRULY GET OUT OF THIS

02:18:04.943 --> 02:18:07.178

YOU THAT THERE ARE MANY PUBLIC

02:18:11.282 --> 02:18:13.551
BENEFITS- TO WHAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:18:13.618 --> 02:18:15.220
DOES IN. ALL OF THOSE SHOULD NOT

02:18:15.286 --> 02:18:19.724
BE. GOOD FUNDED BY BY FEES I'M

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:21.860
PROBABLY FAR MORE INTERESTED IN

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:24.429
MAKING SURE WE CONTINUALLY HAVE

02:18:24.496 --> 02:18:28.299
MODEST FEE INCREASES. A. N. I

02:18:28.366 --> 02:18:30.068
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE STATE OF

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:31.670
CALIFORNIA ADOPT WHAT I THINK IS

02:18:31.736 --> 02:18:33.171
BEST PRACTICE WHICH IS TO HAVE

02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:34.572
THOSE FEE INCREASES HAVE AN

02:18:34.639 --> 02:18:36.541
AUTOMATIC CONSUMER PRICE.

02:18:36.608 --> 02:18:39.611
INFLATION ADDED TO IT I THINK

02:18:39.678 --> 02:18:41.913
IT'S A IT IS YES THERE WILL BE A

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:42.981
POLITICAL BATTLE TO THAT BUT

02:18:43.048 --> 02:18:44.849
THAT OF POLITICAL BATTLE IS ONE.

02:18:44.916 --> 02:18:46.451
WELL WORTH HAVING IF YOU IF YOU

02:18:46.518 --> 02:18:49.487
WIN IT ONCE- YOU YOU ADDRESS A-

02:18:49.554 --> 02:18:52.424
LONG TERM PROBLEM- CHAPTER SEVEN

02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:53.591
THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

02:18:53.658 --> 02:18:56.294
YOUR RESPONSE THANK YOU. AND ALL

02:18:56.361 --> 02:19:02.133
I'LL JUST SAY- I THINK- IT'S

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:03.935
CLEAR THAT INCREASING GOT WE'VE

02:19:04.002 --> 02:19:05.336
WE'VE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH

02:19:05.403 --> 02:19:07.172
ATTEMPTING TO AND INCREASED FEES

02:19:07.238 --> 02:19:12.310
AND WE KNOW- THAT- YOUR SENSE

02:19:12.377 --> 02:19:13.511
THAT WE'VE KIND OF REACHED A

02:19:13.578 --> 02:19:15.547
LIMIT OF HOW FAR WE CAN GO WITH

02:19:15.613 --> 02:19:16.881
MANY OF THESE FEES IS. PROBABLY

02:19:16.948 --> 02:19:19.084
TRUE AND I ALSO AGREE WITH

02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:21.386
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT THAT-

02:19:21.453 --> 02:19:23.388
HAVING A COLA WOULD BE HELPFUL

02:19:23.455 --> 02:19:24.556
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK IT WOULD

02:19:24.622 --> 02:19:27.392
SOLVE. THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE

02:19:27.459 --> 02:19:31.296
BECAUSE- THEY PUT THEIR- WE

02:19:31.362 --> 02:19:33.465
WE'VE GONE SO LONG WITHOUT IT-

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:36.201
ADDRESSING ANY ADJUSTMENTS AT

02:19:36.267 --> 02:19:40.772
ALL IN MANY. CASES- BUT I I'M

02:19:40.839 --> 02:19:46.611
pWE GET TO A PLACE WHERE- WE

02:19:46.678 --> 02:19:48.947
BRING IN THE NECESSARY FUNDING-

02:19:49.013 --> 02:19:51.182
WITHOUT RESORTING TO SOME KIND

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.884
OF FEE INCREASE SO WE'RE SORT OF

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:55.687
IN A CIRCULAR ZONE HERE WHERE WE

02:19:55.754 --> 02:19:57.756
DON'T WANT TO DO WHAT WE MAY

02:19:57.822 --> 02:20:01.126
HAVE TO DO- AND- WE KEEP PUTTING

02:20:01.192 --> 02:20:04.062
IT OFF. AND THINGS KEEP GETTING

02:20:04.129 --> 02:20:07.999
WORSE SO- I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:20:08.066 --> 02:20:10.034
THERE'S AN ANSWER TO THAT IT'S

02:20:10.101 --> 02:20:11.803
REALLY MORE OF AN OBSERVATION A

02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:15.807
FRUSTRATION- IT. COULD I JUST

02:20:15.874 --> 02:20:16.841
RESPONDED THAT REAL QUICKLY

02:20:16.908 --> 02:20:19.310
THERE IS TO IT THE IDEA OF JUST

02:20:19.377 --> 02:20:20.745
GOING YEARS AND YEARS WITHOUT

02:20:20.812 --> 02:20:22.647
ADJUSTING A FEAT THAT'S THAT'S

02:20:22.714 --> 02:20:24.516
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE

02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:25.583
AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS

02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:27.652
THERE'S A DEFICIT YOU KNOW WE'VE

02:20:27.719 --> 02:20:29.220
BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THAT WE'RE

02:20:29.287 --> 02:20:30.054
WE'RE BEHIND. BUT AT LEAST LET'S

02:20:30.121 --> 02:20:31.456
QUIT DIGGING THE HOLE DEEPER

02:20:31.523 --> 02:20:32.891
BECAUSE EVERY YEAR WE DON'T HAVE

02:20:32.957 --> 02:20:35.360
A COLA- WE JUST MAKE WE JUST GET

02:20:35.426 --> 02:20:36.528
THE FEE FURTHER AND FURTHER

02:20:36.594 --> 02:20:37.996
BEHIND WHERE IT SHOULD BE AYE

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:40.465
AYE AYE SO I WE DON'T NEED TO

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:42.066
GET ENGAGED IN A GONNA CALL

02:20:42.133 --> 02:20:43.635
CLEAR BUT I CERTAINLY. DON'T

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:46.104
DISAGREE WITH THAT SENTIMENT- OF

02:20:46.171 --> 02:20:48.506
MY POINT WAS SIMPLY THE WHOLE IS

02:20:48.573 --> 02:20:50.842
ALREADY SO DEEP THAT EVEN WHEN

02:20:50.909 --> 02:20:53.011
WE MOVED TO AS I THINK WE

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:55.980
SHOULD- REGULAR INCREASES BASED

02:20:56.047 --> 02:21:00.218
ON. A SOME KIND OF COLA- WE'RE

02:21:00.285 --> 02:21:02.720
WE'RE NOT GOING TO CLOSE THE-

02:21:02.787 --> 02:21:04.889
THE EXPECT THE GAP AND TO

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:06.825
DECREASE THE DELTA SIGNIFICANTLY

02:21:06.891 --> 02:21:08.960
ENOUGH BUT ENOUGH SAID ABOUT

02:21:09.027 --> 02:21:13.498
THAT- I IN THE COLLECTED THE- TO

02:21:13.565 --> 02:21:16.234
CALL ON ALEJO AND DEPARTMENT OF

02:21:16.301 --> 02:21:17.902
FINANCE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY

02:21:17.969 --> 02:21:23.141
COMMENTS ON. A ISSUE. SIX THE

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:24.542
WILL MOVE TO ISSUE SEVEN. THANK

02:21:24.609 --> 02:21:26.244

APPRECIATE THAT. AND JUST WITH

02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:30.348
ECHO- THAT REQUEST THAT THAT

02:21:30.415 --> 02:21:31.916
THAT SERVICE BASED BUDGET DATA

02:21:31.983 --> 02:21:34.385
BE INTEGRATED INTO FUTURE BUDGET

02:21:34.452 --> 02:21:35.153
REQUEST FROM THE DEPARTMENT

02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:36.588
GREAT TO HEAR THAT COMMITMENT

02:21:36.654 --> 02:21:37.989
FROM THE DIRECTOR THAT. AB

02:21:38.056 --> 02:21:39.958
REALLY WILL HELP YOUR DECISIONS

02:21:40.024 --> 02:21:41.926
TO UNDERSTAND HOW PROPOSALS

02:21:41.993 --> 02:21:45.330
MIGHT HELP CLOSE OR WIDEN GAPS.

02:21:45.396 --> 02:21:47.131
ALSO JUST REITERATE THAT PART OF

02:21:47.198 --> 02:21:48.266
THE REASON THE LEGISLATURE

02:21:48.333 --> 02:21:50.702
PURSUED THIS S. B. B. EXERCISE

02:21:50.768 --> 02:21:52.704
WAS TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THESE

02:21:52.770 --> 02:21:53.872
FEET VERSUS GENERAL FUND

02:21:53.938 --> 02:21:56.074
ALIGNMENT ISSUES SO. THAT DATA

02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:58.643
WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT- IN ANY

02:21:58.710 --> 02:22:00.912
FUTURE DECISION. WHILE I THINK

02:22:00.979 --> 02:22:02.647
THE DIRECTOR MAKES A GOOD POINT

02:22:02.714 --> 02:22:03.715
THAT THE GAPS ARE LARGE ENOUGH

02:22:03.781 --> 02:22:06.651
THAT. THAT FEES WOULDN'T BE

02:22:06.718 --> 02:22:08.019
FEASIBLE NOR APPROPRIATE IN MANY

02:22:08.086 --> 02:22:09.954
CASES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE

02:22:10.021 --> 02:22:11.856
PUBLIC TRUST RESPONSIBILITIES.

02:22:11.923 --> 02:22:13.691
TO HELP CLOSE THIS GAP. THAT

02:22:13.758 --> 02:22:14.692
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WHEN YOU'RE

02:22:14.759 --> 02:22:16.361
ADDING NEW IN PARTICULAR WHEN

02:22:16.427 --> 02:22:18.129
YOU'RE ADDING NEW EXPLICIT

02:22:18.196 --> 02:22:20.098
ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE EXPLICIT

02:22:20.164 --> 02:22:21.933
BENEFICIARIES BUT IT'S NOT

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.868
APPROPRIATE TO THINK ABOUT. WHO

02:22:23.935 --> 02:22:26.070
SHOULD PAY FOR THAT- JUST

02:22:26.137 --> 02:22:27.538
BECAUSE THERE WAS A VERY

02:22:27.605 --> 02:22:30.241
SUBSTANTIAL FEE PROPOSAL SEVERAL

02:22:30.308 --> 02:22:31.910
YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BROAD BASE

02:22:31.976 --> 02:22:33.778
THAT HAD A LOT OF RESISTANCE.

02:22:33.845 --> 02:22:35.079
SHOULDN'T PRECLUDE YOU FROM

02:22:35.146 --> 02:22:37.482
CONSIDERING INDIVIDUAL FEE

02:22:37.548 --> 02:22:39.684
INCREASES- WHEN APPROPRIATE FOR

02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:41.920
EXPLICIT ACTIVITIES. AT WITH

02:22:41.986 --> 02:22:43.788
REGARD TO LIVE FOR PROPOSALS

02:22:43.855 --> 02:22:45.456
BEFORE YOU IN THIS AGENDA ITEM

02:22:45.523 --> 02:22:47.258
WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS IN

02:22:47.325 --> 02:22:48.693
PART BECAUSE OF AS THE DIRECTOR

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:49.727
MENTIONED THERE ARE SOME PUBLIC

02:22:49.794 --> 02:22:51.896
BENEFIT. ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL

02:22:51.963 --> 02:22:52.964
OF THEM THAT THAT COULD

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:54.666
POTENTIALLY ALSO HAVE A FEE

02:22:54.732 --> 02:22:57.368
PAYING BENEFICIARIES BUT- JUST

02:22:57.435 --> 02:22:58.670
ONE ECHO THAT THIS IS A REALLY

02:22:58.736 --> 02:22:59.570
IMPORTANT CONTINUOUS

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:01.506
CONVERSATION I HAVE EVERY YEAR

02:23:01.572 --> 02:23:02.874

DO HAVE MULTIPLE CONSTITUENCIES

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:05.643
MULTIPLE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES.

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:08.112
AND MULTIPLE FUND SOURCES- SO

02:23:08.179 --> 02:23:09.647
ASKING THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS

02:23:09.714 --> 02:23:11.716
THAT CAN CONTINUES TO BE REALLY

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:13.151
IMPORTANT IT'S BEST ESPECIALLY

02:23:13.217 --> 02:23:14.252
WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

02:23:14.319 --> 02:23:15.954

PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION

02:23:38.109 --> 02:23:38.810

THEY'RE COSTING MORE THAN- THAT

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:23.821
IS REASONABLE. IF YOU WERE TO

02:24:23.888 --> 02:24:27.225
LOOK FORWARD THREE OR FIVE YEARS

02:24:27.291 --> 02:24:28.826

WE WILL TAKE THAT AND USE THAT

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:24.135
MONEY FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

02:27:24.202 --> 02:27:26.170
