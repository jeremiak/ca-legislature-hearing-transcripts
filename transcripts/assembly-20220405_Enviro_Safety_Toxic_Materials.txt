WE HAVE SEVEN BILLS ON TODAY'S COMMITTEE TWO OF WHICH ARE ON CONSENT. WE DON'T YET HAVE A QUORUM WILL ESTABLISH THAT- WILL NEED FIVE AND- WE DO WE ONLY HAVE THREE AT THE MOMENT SO WE WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND HEAR TESTIMONY ON OUR FIRST BILL- LET'S SEE. WHO IS THE ORDER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN AB NINETEEN FIFTY THREE DRINKING WATER ACCESSIBLE WATER BOTTLE REFILL STATIONS. PLEASE PERCEPT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EVERY OUR CONSUMERS THROW AWAY TWO AND A HALF MILLION PLASTIC BOTTLES IN LESS THAN 30% OF THESE PLASTIC BOTTLES ARE RECYCLED THIS YEAR THE CONSUMPTION OF PLASTIC BOTTLES IS SET TO HIT HALF A TRILLION THIS OUTWEIGHS RECYCLING EFFORTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MASSIVELY JEOPARDIZE THE ENVIRONMENT ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT NEARLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER. CALIFORNIA FACES MANY CHALLENGES IN PROVIDING CLEAN SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. TO ALL OF ITS CITIZENS INCLUDING ON HOUSE LOW INCOME AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES AB NINETEEN FIFTY THREE WILL REQUIRE THE OWNER OPERATOR OF A TRANSIT HUB LOCAL PARK. PUBLIC BUILDING SHOPPING MALL OR GOLF COURSE TO INSTALL AND MAINTAIN AT LEAST ONE ACCESSIBLE WATER BOTTLE REFILL STATION. ENSURING THE STATIONS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IMPROVES ACCESSIBILITY TO DRINKING WATER REDUCES PLASTIC WASTE AND CREATES LASTING INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT FOR CONSUMERS OPTING TO REUSE. WITH ME I HAVE ELECTED TO CHAVEZ ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND RESPECTFULLY WOULD REQUEST ABOUT ABOUT. ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME'S LEXI CH√ÅVEZ SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE OF THE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE SPELL. EVERY YEAR MORE THAN THREE POINT FIVE BILLION PLASTIC BOTTLES ARE THROWN INTO THE LANDFILL OR LATER IN CALIFORNIA SINGLE USE PLASTIC BOTTLES ARE RESOURCE INTENSIVE TO MANUFACTURE FILL AND SHIP AROUND THE GLOBE. EACH ONE COMES WITH A HEFTY CARBON FOOTPRINT BESIDES RE USE AND RECYCLING WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO REUSE OUR- REDUCE OUR SINGLE USE PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES. THE EASIEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT SINGLE USE PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES DON'T END UP SITTING IN A LANDFILL OR FLOATING IN OUR WATERSHEDS. AND OCEANS IS TO AVOID THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE THE AVERAGE CONSUMER DRINKS AROUND SIXTY FOUR OUNCES OF WATER PER DAY WHICH CAN AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SINGLE USE PLASTIC BOTTLES PER YEAR. BY SWITCHING TO JUST ONE REUSABLE WATER BOTTLE FOR THE YEAR CONSUMERS CAN GREATLY REDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT ALREADY OPT FOR REUSABLE WATER BOTTLE. WHAT'S LEFT IS CREATING ACCESSIBLE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THIS PRACTICE OF FOR USE WITH WHICH AB NINETEEN FIFTY THREE WILL DO. THIS BILL REQUIRES PUBLICLY ACCESSED X. AREAS SUCH AS TRANSIT HUBS AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS TO HAVE ACCESSIBLE REFILLABLE WATER BOTTLE STATIONS. AB NINETEEN FIFTY THREE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CLEAN WATER ACCESS EASIER OR REDUCING THE DEMAND FOR SINGLE USE PLASTIC. WATER BOTTLES THANK YOU KNOW RESPECT LAST YEAR ABOUT.

TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY SIX OH ONE A BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE ISSUANCE OF A WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT FOR A NEW LANDFILL WAIT LATERAL EXPANSION OF ANY EXISTING AND FILL THAT IS USED FOR THE DISPOSAL OF NON HAZARDOUS SOLID WASTE IF THE LAND IS LOCATED WITHIN THE VICINITY OF THE U. S. MEXICO BORDER. THIS BILLS ATTEMPTING TO HELP CURB THE AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS AND AIR QUALITY IMPACTS THAT HARM THE HEALTH OF OUR BORDER COMMUNITIES WHY NOT ASK AND- I APOLOGIZE MISS IRWIN WAS NEXT IF YOU DON'T MIND WILL HEAR MR GARCIA. I JUST DIDN'T SEE YOU. WHICH IS RIDICULOUS BUT SOMETIMES WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES. A GUY HAD MISTRIAL BE EVEN. SHORTER OUR GOAL HERE IS TO. ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN PLAGUE IN THE- ORDER COMMUNITIES OF CALIFORNIA- THE U. S. MEXICO BORDER. WITH ME IS MY BE CAST A DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR THE OFFICE OF VICE CHAIR NORA VARGAS COUNTY SUPERVISOR. FOR SAN DIEGO WHO IS HERE TO TESTIFY ON THIS BILL. HI EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD TODAY ON BEHALF OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY VICE CHAIR NORA VARGAS IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX OH ONE. AB TWENTY SIX A ONE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF MANY RESIDENTS IN SANTA COUNTY ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO LIVE IN BY STROKES IS DISTRICT NEAR THE US BORDER WITH MEXICO. OUR FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES NEAR THE BORDER FACE MANY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES- THAT INCLUDE POOR AIR QUALITY AND LACK OF GREEN OPEN SPACE. LANDFILLS ARE AMONG SOCIETY'S MOST IMPACTFUL LAND USES AND NUMEROUS LAWS ARE IN PLACE RESTRICTING THEIR CITING TO SAFE DISTANCES FROM HOMES SCHOOLS AND OTHER SENSITIVE AREAS. HOWEVER STATE LAW DOES NOT CURRENTLY ADDRESSED THE IMPACT OF LOCAL. OF LOCATING PROPOSED LANDFILLS AND COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN YOU'RE THE U. S. MEXICO BORDER. OUR BORDER AREA WAS RECENTLY RATED NINETY OUT OF ONE HUNDRED ON THE LATEST CALAVERAS SCREEN MAKING IT ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA. NOT SURPRISINGLY OUR BORDERS PREDOMINANTLY LATINO WORKING FAMILIES AND HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED. THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IDOLING OF VEHICLES INCLUDING BUT IN IN THE CROSSLAND PORTS OF ENTRY. I'M THE PRESENT HUGE CHALLENGE TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND LOCAL AIR QUALITY AS A RESULT IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY AND MORALLY WRONG TO PLACE OUR MOST POLLUTING LAND USES IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AB TWENTY SIX OH ONE WILL PROTECT OUR BORDER COMMUNITIES FROM BEING FURTHER FOR IN WITH AIR POLLUTION MORE GROUND ARE PER WATER POLLUTION AND MORE TRUCK TRAFFIC. IT WILL ALSO HELP ENSURE THE TROUBLE BE CUENTA RIVER VALLEY IS NOT FURTHER POLLUTED BEYOND CURRENT LEVELS. AND IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR COUNTIES CLIMATE ACTION PLAN ON BEHALF OF VICE CHAIR MARKETS I WANT TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL. IT'S TIME THE STATE LAW PROTECT THESE BORDER COMMUNITIES FROM THE IMPACTS OF LANDFILLS IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT DES FOR SCHOOLS ANOTHER SENSITIVE LAND USES. FURTHERMORE AB TWENTY SIX A ONE ALSO HAS ECONOMIC BENEFITS. I UNDERSTAND YOU WOULD BE PART OF A NATIONAL REGION CURRENTLY FUELS A TWO HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION CROSS BORDER ECONOMY. AND SOFOR THE REASONS ARE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CLIMATE ACTION AND OUR CROSS BORDER ECONOMY. WE ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT. OF AB TWENTY SIX A ONE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD ARM. I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. I KNOW IT'S REGISTERED FOR THAT SO- WHAT I'LL DO NOW IS ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO IS IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. ALEXA CH√ÅVEZ OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANYONE IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM LINES- AND WE'LL HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO HAS SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION AGAIN THIS IS ONLY ON AB TWENTY SIX OH ONE GARCIA.

FOR OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SIX OH ONE. YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME.

WHERE SHALL LEVY BALANCE BUT THE FIVE GYRES INSTITUTE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX OH ONE. THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN THE QUEUE FOR AB TWENTY SIX OH ONE ALL RIGHT- FIRST STEP- QUESTIONS THEN OR COMMENTS FROM THE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'LL JUST MAKE A COMMENT WHICH IS- I THINK IT'S GOOD TO KEEP WHAT COULD BE A CONTROVERSIAL FACILITY AWAY FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER- JUST MAKES THINGS THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND SO I THINK THIS IS A WORTHWHILE BILL MR GARCIA WOULD YOU BUT SEE CAN WE HAVE A MOTION ARE WE'VE HAD A- AS WE HAVE THE MOTION YET NOW. OKAY AND THEN YOU MAY CLOSE I CONCUR WITH YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR AND I WOULD SAY IN THE CON THE CONSENT CALENDAR YOU APPROVED ANOTHER BILL DEALING WITH BORDER REGION POLLUTION TIJUANA NEW RIVER HI AND SO- IT IT CLEARLY MAKES SENSE THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS AND THOSE WHO CROSSED THE BORDER ON A REGULAR BASIS- WITH MEXICO AT PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR US IN CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL ABSOLUTELY AND YOUR COMMENT ON. OTHER BILLS AND THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEW RIVER- THE- OTHER POLLUTION COMING ACROSS THE BORDER A CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE COMBAT GOING TO BE CAN DONATE MONEY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THE SICK SO. MISTER ROSS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWENTY SIX OH ONE EDUARDO GARCIA THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES. CORK HI GREGORY SMITH. SMITH NOW A REGULAR OUR QUE HAN CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA HI HOLDEN MURATSUCHI I WALDRON. CURRENTLY AT THREE OKAY WE HAVE THREE AND- IT'S JUST A BUSY DAY WITH PEOPLE PRESENTING ANOTHER COMMITTEE SO WELL WE'LL GET WE'LL GET EVERYBODY HERE EVENTUALLY. OUR JUST EVEN BEFORE YOU START ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN. WE'VE HAVE OTHER BILLS ON BATTERY RECYCLING BEFORE I THINK THIS IS THE BEST VERSION WE'VE EVER SEEN I GUESS I'M LETTING PEOPLE KNOW WHAT I THINK YOUR BELT AND YOU OF WORK BETTER WITH- ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND- LET ME SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH DOCTOR QUIRK FOR THAT AND I HAVE TO SAY WE- HAVE EXCELLENT STAFF ALLEN OF THEY HAVE WORKED THEY THEY HAVE. HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE BUT WE DO NEED TO. RESOLVE THAT. SO AB AT TWENTY FOUR FORTY WOULD CREATE A SAFE ACCESSIBLE SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIANS TO DROP OFF BATTERIES FOR PROPER DISPOSAL. BATTERIES ARE BECOMING MORE PREVALENT IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES AND THE LACK OF CONVENIENT DISPOSAL OPTIONS IS LEADING TO HIGHER LEVELS OF TOXIC BATTERIES ENTERING INTO OUR WASTE STREAM. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY EIGHT TEEN SURVEY OF TWENTY SIX OF CALIFORNIA MARCH TWENTY FACILITIES EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE FIRE DURING THE PRIOR TWO YEARS. AND BATTERIES BECAUSE 65% OF THOSE FIRES WE MUST DO BETTER WITHOUT DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BATTERIES ENTERING CALIFORNIA'S WAY STREAM WE CAN UNDOUBTEDLY SUFFER ADDITIONAL FIRES THAT COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF LIVES AND PROPERTY. AND- JEOPARDIZE CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE I WANT TO THANK AGAIN THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL. AND EMPHASIZE MY COMMITMENT TO FINDING SOLUTIONS AND ALLEVIATING CONCERNS. AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE- KAYLA ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE AND CHASE AND SMELTER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STILL STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. VERY WELL WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST. OKAY HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAN ROB ON THE OF READ WASTE WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY BASED IN SAN MATEO COUNTY- THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY. FORTY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND RESIDENCES AND ELEVEN THOUSAND BUSINESSES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS OF A LITHIUM ION BATTERY INDUCED FIRE AT A RECYCLING CENTER. THEY COMPLETELY DEVASTATED OUR FACILITY SHUTTING US DOWN FOR NINETY DAYS AND CAUSING EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY A YEAR TO FULLY REPAIR EVERYTHING. PRIOR TO THE FIRE WE HAD JUST ONE SHERMAN SOME PROVIDER NOW WE NEED SEVEN TO PROVIDE THE SAME KIND OF COVERAGE. INSURANCE PROVIDERS ARE FINDING IT TOO RISKY TO COVER FACILITIES LIKE OURS AFTER THE EXCESSIVE DAMAGES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PREVENTATIVE MEASURES TO REMOVE BATTERIES FROM ARE WE STREAM BUT LAST YEAR ALONE WE SUFFERED TWELVE FIRES BETWEEN OUR MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITY AND TRANSFER STATION. TEN OF THEM COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. ANYONE OF THESE FIRES COULD GROW INTO A FIRE LIKE THE ONE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND ANOTHER MAJOR FIRE COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE OUR INTERNS COMPLETELY. FURTHERMORE THESE BATTERIES THREATEN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PUBLICLY FUNDED WASTE COLLECTION AND RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND INSPIRES POSE A SAFETY HAZARD TO OUR WORKERS. THIS ISSUE IS COMMON AT MARKS ACROSS THE NATION THIS IS A CRISIS THAT NEEDS A SOLUTION NOW AS LOOKING MINE BATTERIES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMON EVERYDAY PRODUCTS. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY IS CRITICAL TO DIVERTING BATTERIES AND PRODUCTS IN THE WASTE STREAM TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR ENVIRONMENT AND I RESPECTFULLY OR DRIVE UP. THANK YOU. MISTER SMELSER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE WITH YOU- IN PERSON AGAIN. ADJACENT SPONSOR SHAGARI ATTRITIONAL THROUGH AND LAYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL A CO SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE BUT ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL ALAMEDA. COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY OR STOP WASTE AND THE WESTERN PLASTER WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY SO. KILL SPOKE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY FOUR FORTY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF TAXPAYER TAXPAYER FUNDED SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE I'M GONNA FOCUS ON WHAT THE BILL. DOES KIND OF MECHANICALLY. AT FIRST I WANNA BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH DEMONIZING SPECIFIC PRODUCTS THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT AT ALL- IT'S SIMPLY A RECOGNITION THAT SOME PRODUCTS HAVE UNIQUE IMPACTS- AND PRODUCERS- SHOULD THEREFORE SHARING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COLLECTION AND RECYCLING. SO IT'S NOT ABOUT DEMONISATION IT'S JUST ABOUT COLLABORATION AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY REQUIRES PRODUCERS OF LOOSE BATTERIES. AND BATTERY AN EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. HIGHER VERSIONS OF THIS BILL. HAD BOTH PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN ONE PROGRAM THIS BILL SPLITS THEM SEPARATELY SO THE- MANUFACTURERS CAN RUN THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT PROGRAMS- MORE SUITED TO THE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. SIMILAR TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL BILL- WHEN IT DID SHARP SINBAD'S SEPARATELY- THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY TWENTY TO FOUR FORTY IS STRUCTURALLY CONSISTENT WITH RECENTLY PASSED YOUR CHIP PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE AGAIN SB TWO ONE TWO. IS THE MOST RECENT VERSION THE BILL DOES SEVERAL THINGS AT REQUIRES PRODUCERS TO DESIGN FUND AND IMPLEMENT A TAKE BACK AND RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR THEIR PRODUCTS- IT CONTAINS A PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS THAT PROVIDES OVERSIGHT THE GIVES PRODUCERS THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM. IT'S A PERFORMANCE BASED METRICS AS OPPOSED TO A COMMAND CONTROL REGULATION. SEES ME. IT ESTABLISHES MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COLLECTION NETWORK THAT CREATES AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE SO ALL STAKEHOLDERS CAN HAVE A VOICE IN THE PROCESS- ANY CREATES AN OBLIGATION ON SOME RETAILERS BUT NOT ALL. A TO COLLECT LOOSE BATTERIES- AND SOME- BATTERY AND BETTER PRODUCTS. AND FINALLY IT ESTABLISHES STRONG OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS- I ALSO WANT TO THINK- THE DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE WORKING CONSTRUCTIVELY ON AB. TWENTY FOUR FORTY SOME OF WHOM WERE PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED BY THE CONVERSATION THIS YEAR. HAS BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE AND WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY THE DISCUSSIONS- AND THEN FINALLY AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS USUALLY SOME OF THE DETAILS OF TWENTY FOUR FORTY WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE YOU MAY NOTICE A FEW BLANKS IN THE BILL- WERE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND COME TO AGREEMENT BEFORE WE FILL IN SOME OF THOSE DETAILS. THAT'S WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE- AND CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. A COLD FRONT TO DO SO. VERY GOOD- WE HAVE. A PRIMARY. OPPOSITION WITNESS FOR AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY- AND I BELIEVE HE IS ON THE LINE WALTER ALL POWER AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL VICE PRESIDENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND INDUSTRY SUSTAINABILITY I DON'T HAVE MY NOTES WHAT THE ORGANIZATION IS SIMPLY STATE THAT- SO MISTER A ALCORN YOU SHOULD BE LIVE ON THE LINE AND IF YOU WANT MEET YOURSELF WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE HEAR YOU FINE. OKAY THANK YOU AND- THANK YOU ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN- I AM WALTER ALCORN ON THE CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS OF CONSUMER ELECTRONICS. WHICH ACTUALLY INCLUDE BATTERIES AND HAVE BEEN BATTERED BATTERIES- SIXTY EIGHT PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR THE PRODUCE AT THE PRODUCER OF STEVIA THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW. IN LAS VEGAS EVERY YEAR AND- WITH THAT- BUT THAT EVENT WHAT THE LARGEST TRADE SHOW IN THE COUNTRY AND THE WE HAVE. AN EVENT WHERE MANY INNOVATORS HAVE PRODUCED PRODUCTS USED IN OUR HOMES FOR THE FIRST TIME- WE SEE A LOT OF INNOVATION THERE. MY COMMENTS ARE GONNA FOCUS ON BATTERY INVENTED PRODUCTS- ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED- SPECIFICALLY ON BATTERY COLLECTION PROGRAMS- THE BEST- MOST IMPORTANT PROGRAM ELEMENT FOR DIVERTING BATTERIES TO PROPER RECYCLING IS BETTER PUBLIC EDUCATION- SO WE'RE REALLY NOT ADDRESSING. BATTERY PORTIONS OF THE BILL. ALTHOUGH I DO APPRECIATE SOME OF THE DETAILS ARE STILL BEING WORKED OUT THERE TO. PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH BATTERY IN PLAN AS THEY VERY NEEDS THAN BLUE SPATTER. THAT NEED TO BE CALLED- FIRST. BATTERIES ARE IN THEY'RE INVISIBLE TO CONSUMERS AND THEREFORE- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COLLECTION SYSTEM THAT WILL NOT BE INTUITIVE BUT TO CONSUMERS THERE ARE A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN BETTER BATTERIES. THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BETTER BATTERIES OR MAY NOT YOU KNOW LIKE HEADPHONES OR EAR BUDS SMARTPHONE CASES PORTABLE PRINTERS WATCHES- LOTS OF SMALL APPLIANCES. THERE REALLY IS- IT'S REALLY A MODEL BY MODEL IN SOME CASES DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A BATTERY IN BETTER THAN US AND WE WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE WAY THIS IS STRUCTURED THAT WOULD NOT BE INTO TO CONSUMERS AND RETAILERS. AND OTHERS ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM THE OTHER CONCERN WE HAVE IS ON THE PRE APPROVED TO SELL PROVISIONS- BASICALLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY THAT PRODUCTS ARE MENTIONED BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING FROM CAR KEYLESS ENTRY REMOTES TO PORTABLE GLUCOSE READERS AND SMOKE ALARMS YOU KNOW THEY ALL INVOLVE HAVING BETTER BATTERIES AND THE CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET AND THEY'RE GONNA BE FUTURE INNOVATIONS THAT COME TO SO. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH THE IMPACT OF THE BATTERY BETTER PRODUCTS THE SAME WAY AS LOOSE BATTERIES. EXPAND I THINK OUR COME ELECTRON WASTE PRO. WITH THE- CONSUMER FOR. TO COVER THE PRODUCT THAT. IN BETTER BATTERIES AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE. WITH A SPONSOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE. WE CAN- WORK IN THAT DIRECTION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY CLEAR TESTIMONY- SO NOW WE WILL GO TO- YES WELL ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO IS IN SUPPORT. HI MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AT BETWEEN YOUR POSITION HERE FIELDING GRIEVES OF VIACOM CALIFORNIA REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL ADDRESSING CLASS TO CLASS THREE MEDICAL DEVICES WERE STILL HAVE REMAINING TECHNICAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF APPLICATION FOR CLASS ONE MEDICAL DEVICES.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS ON AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY POINT I'D LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL AND I WOULD ASK THE VICE CHAIR OF HE MIGHT GIVE ME A COURTESY SECOND. YES BUT I DO HAVE A ONE QUESTION OR JUST A CALL YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO VOTE FOR JUST A MINUTE JACKSON'S. DOING ANYTHING. THANK YOU WE'RE WE'RE A LITTLE. SHORT ON THE MODEL NOW SO. IN JUST JUST AWARENESS OF THE BATTERIES WERE START WITH YOUR BILL HERE. GOING INTO THE FUTURE WITH A LITHIUM BATTERY FOR THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE READY TO. DO SOMETHING WITH THESE RECYCLE BATTERIES. WE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE SHIP THE BURNED UP WITH A THOUSAND CARS AND- BECAUSE A LITHIUM BATTERIES. BUT THE START THAT CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD NOT PART OF A NUMBER OF THIS WITH PROGRAM BUT IT IT IS CERTAINLY A BIG CONVERSATION WE DO NEED TO KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF THOSE- CAR BATTERIES. OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE RECYCLED. AND BUT IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON. HAVE RIGHT NOW I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT WITH THAT STUFF. LIKE TO START THE SECOND I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORTER RIGHT NOW BUT I LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION APPRECIATE THAT. I HAVE A QUESTION AND I APOLOGIZE IF THIS STARTED ADDRESSED RUNNING FROM ONE COMMITTEE HEARING TO ANOTHER DIFFERENT BUILDINGS- BUT I KNOW THAT THE PREDECESSOR BILL HAD AN EXEMPTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THOSE WITH GROSS RECEIPTS OVER MILLION DOLLARS HAVING TO DO THESE TORTURE PROGRAMS. AND I THINK THAT'S IN THE BILL NOW BUT IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'RE CONSIDERING. THERE THERE IS A FOR COLLECTION SITES YES AN EXEMPTION FOR. IT IS THE ID NUMBER FIVE YEAH IT'S FIVE ONE MILLIONS OF UNDER FIVE LOCATIONS YET AND STATE OKAY THANK YOU. VERY GOOD- YOU MAY CLOSE ALL RIGHT AND I DO WANT TO ADDRESS JUST QUICKLY SOME OF THE ISSUES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS OBVIOUSLY THE WHAT WE HAVE FOR RECYCLING RIGHT NOW IS A BATTERY RECYCLING IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND THIS IS A CRUCIAL ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE IT'S TWO SEPARATE IF YOU ARE PROGRAM SO YOU HEARD A LOT OF THE- OPPOSITION MENTIONED THE CONCERN ABOUT EMBEDDED BATTERIES BUT THEY ALMOST WENT ALONG THEIR OWN ARGUMENT WHEN THEY STARTED ALONG THE LIST OF WELDERS CELLPHONES AND THERE'S WATCHES AND THERE'S THIS AND THERE'S THAT AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROBLEM SO IT IS. REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE DEAL WITH NOT ONLY THE EMBEDDED ISSUE WHICH WILL BE SEPARATE FROM THE LOOSE BATTERIES AND I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO MISTER SMELLS ARE TO SEE IF HE HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD ON TO THAT BUT I JUST I JUST WANT TO SAY NO EVEN I GUESS GOOD MISTER GOVERNOR AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SOMEBODY THAT HAS IT. FOUR YEARS WE ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EVERY SINGLE STAKEHOLDER AND- I HEARD. ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE SPEAKERS TALK ABOUT EDUCATION. EDUCATION IS THE BOTTOM LINE THE MOST THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF IT WE CANNOT BE SUCCESSFUL UNTIL EVERYBODY KNOWS EXACTLY. WHERE WHEN THEY'RE VAPING PEN IS OF IT IS IT IS COMPOSED. THE HEAD WE THAT THAT THAT THEY PUT IT IN A SAFE SPOT SO IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE IT CAUSING FIRES IN OUR RECYCLING. FACILITIES AND POLLUTING OUR ENVIRONMENT SO I THINK THAT YOU HAD A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON SOME OF THE OPPOSITION BEYOND THAT. YEAH I MEAN I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST OBSERVE I THINK- HISTORICALLY THESE PROGRAMS WORK BEST- WHEN THERE'S A NEGOTIATED COMPROMISE IN THE GUEST BE TWO ONE TWO AGAIN TO GO BACK. THAT IS REALLY MAYBE THAT'S- WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO FOLLOW THAT SAME. PATH HERE WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH FOLKS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE OPPOSE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY BUY INTO- SO THAT'S CERTAINLY OUR GOAL WILL CONTINUE DOWN THAT PATH. YES SO THANK YOU. VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL AND THE- WOULD JUST APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT WELL IF ANYONE CAN DO IT YOU AND I. REALLY HOPE THAT THAT WILL MAKE IT THIS TIME. MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I DON'T NUMBER TWO AB TWO FOUR. IRWIN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES. WORK HIGH. COURT HI SMITH. SMITH NO ARAMBULA OUR QUE HAN BURKE AND I CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA HI HOLDEN. MATHIS HOW DOES NOT VOTING MURATSUCHI WALDRON. WILL EVENTUALLY GET ENOUGH PEOPLE THAT ARE TO PASS THEY'LL- THANK YOU AT THE MOMENT THEN I'D LIKE TO BRING UP MISS FRIEDMAN. AND I'D LIKE I HAVE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE TO ADD ON AND PUBLIC SAFETY. ARM AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS MAKE A MOTION AND JUST IN CASE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE LATER ON COULD I HAVE A SECOND. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. SO MOTION AND A SECOND. MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OF COURSE I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU- QUIRK AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS. AB TWENTY SEVENTY ONE WOULD PROHIBIT THE INCLUSION OF P. FOSS CHEMICALS IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS SO THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE LIPSTICK AND FACE CREAM AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS IN THE CLASS OF CHEMICALS KNOWN AS OUR I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT. THE P. FOSS ARE A LARGE FAMILY OF CHEMICALS KNOWN FOR THEIR LONG LASTING WATER AND OIL RESISTANT AND TEMPERATURE RETAINING PROPERTIES HOWEVER THESE PRODUCTS SHED P. PASSED CHEMICALS OVERTIME AND EXPOSE PEOPLE O THE CHEMICALS. PFOS CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON HUMAN HEALTH INCLUDING ON CHILDREN AND IS SOMEONE WHOSE EIGHT YEAR OLD IS GETTING INTO HER MAKE UP PRETTY MUCH ON A DAILY BASIS IT IS A CONCERN TO ME PERSONALLY. RECENT TESTING SHOWS THAT MANUFACTURERS INTENTIONALLY ADD P. FOSTER PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS LIPSTICK MASCARA AND SHAVING CREAM SO YOU MEN ARE NOT IMMUNE. SINCE THE P. FAST CHEMICALS ARE NOT ESSENTIAL FOR THESE PRODUCTS TO BE USED AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS WITHOUT P. FAUCETS ARE AVAILABLE PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED. LITTLE REASON. A RESTRICTION ON THE KILLER CARE AT THE SALE OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING P. FOSS. IS REALLY THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS TO PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT PRESENT A HEALTH RISK TO THEIR FAMILIES. JUST BY THEIR MERE PRSENCE IN THEIR HOME. AND I WANT TO SAY THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I DID NOT INTRODUCED THIS BILL. UNTIL I FIRST REACHED OUT TO INDUSTRY. AND ASK THEM IF THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THE EFFORT TO BAN P. FAUCETS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. AND THEY ARE ALL CHOSE TO WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL ONE TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE AND I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THAT. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO MEET AND WORK WITH THEM. REGARDING WE AMEND THIS BILL TO ALLOW FOR SOME UNINTENTIONAL CONTAMINATION OF PRODUCTS. THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SUPERIOR IN MANY PRODUCTS. AT THAT DON'T HAVE P. FAUCETS ON THE INGREDIENT LABEL. SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TRYING TO SCREEN THEM OUT IN YOUR HOME IT WILL BE VERY VERY HARD TO. AND THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF PEOPLE PAST. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO WAS ON OF WATER BOARD FOR ALMOST EIGHT YEARS. FOSSE'S ARE ALSO A REAL EMERGING. CONTAMINANT OF CONCERN BECAUSE THE LEECH OFF OF THESE PRODUCTS WHEN YOU WASH YOUR FACE. AND GO INTO THE WATER SUPPLY AND RIGHT NOW THE EATABLE. I TO GET OUT OF WILL. AT THEIR- CUSTOMERS AND WHY DON'T WANT TO BE DRINKING THE STUFF. AND REALLY WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET A HANDLE ON IT. NOW P. FAUCETS CANNELLA FUNCTIONALLY FUNCTIONAL USE A VERY LOW LEVEL SOME COSMETICS. FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN BE INTENTIONALLY ATTITUDE INGREDIENT- INTO A COSMETIC THEN. AND THEN THE P. FOSS MY ONLY JOB IS A VERY TRACE AMOUNT IN THE OVERALL PRODUCT- THAT SAID I AM WILLING TO WORK. WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WITH MANUFACTURERS TO IDENTIFY A SAFE BUT REASONABLE AWAY WAY. TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS UNINTENTIONAL CROSS CONTAMINATION OF PEOPLE ASSETS AND PRODUCTS. TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE ISSUES A LITTLE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AT DOCTOR. LYDIA JOB WITH THE GREEN SCIENCE. POLICY INSTITUTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR- YOUR PRESENTATION FOR OUR FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL. MY NAME IS SUSAN LITTLE ON THE AND I'M WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP A CO SPONSOR OF AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN ONE. BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS AND CAL PERGER ALSO CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. CONCERNS ARE MOUNTING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ABOUT THE TOXICITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERSISTENCE AT THE FAST CHEMICALS THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED IT PLANS TO PHASE OUT ALL NON ESSENTIAL USES A P. FAST. AND CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN THESE BILLS HAS MOVED FORWARD TO PROHIBIT THE ENTIRE CLASS OF P. FAST. FOR MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND OUR DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL HAS ALSO TAKEN ACTION ON THE ENTIRE PATH CLASS OF P. FAST AND OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE CARPETS- SO HOW ABOUT P. FAST IN THE PRODUCTS THAT WE APPLY TO OUR BODIES EVERY DAY. RESEARCH INDICATES THAT MANY COSMETICS CONTAIN P. FAST EVEN WHEN THE P. FAST IS NOT LISTED ON THE PRODUCT'S LABEL. BECAUSE WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE THE PRIMARY. USERS OF COSMETICS THERE GET GUYS YOU GUYS USE IT TOO. BUT WOMEN AND GIRLS WE KNOW EVEN TEENAGE GIRLS CAN USE AS MANY AS A DOZEN PRODUCTS EVERY MORNING WHEN THEY'RE GETTING READY. TO GO TO SCHOOL. TO GET OUT THE DOOR. THIRTY FASTER LINK SHOULD LINK TO A RANGE OF HEALTH EFFECTS INCLUDING THE DESTRUCTION OF HORMONES AND HORMONE RESPONSES TO WOMEN AND GIRLS. BECAUSE MEDICS WITH P. FAST. COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THEIR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHILDREN. PLEASE PROTECT WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM THIS DALY AND UNNECESSARY EXPOSURE TO P. FAST AND SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU- PHONE MODERATOR YOU CAN DO YOU HAVE A DOCTOR LYDIA CHAHAL BUT THE GREEN SCIENCE POLICY INSTITUTE ON THE PHONE LIKE. AS WE LOOK UP AND REMIND US OF. THANK YOU HI CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES. RIGHT ON MY NAME IS WHAT THE DOCTOR LYDIA DAHLE I HAVE A PHD IN CHEMISTRY AND I CURRENTLY WORK WITH THE GREEN SCIENCE POLICY INSTITUTE WE ARE A GROUP OF FINE BUT WORK TOWARDS THE REDUCTION OF HELP COMING CHEMICALS IN EVERYDAY CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND THE SUPPORT AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE. WHAT JUNIOR MY INSTITUTE CO AUTHOR TO PEER REVIEWED PAPER WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME THAT MEASURE TEETH IN CHEMICAL OUR RESEARCH SHOWED HIGH LEVELS OF FLOORING WHICH IS THE MARKET PRETTY FAST IN MORE THAN HALF OF. HIS THIRTY ONE COSMETIC PRODUCTS WHEN WE TESTED SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS BURKE UP WITH MALTA SOMETHING THAT OF INDIVIDUAL FEEDBACK COMICAL EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT CONTAINS AT LEAST A DIFFERENT PATH ALL OF WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF HEALTH HARMS INCLUDING CAN'T. PRESS WHAT- AND DISRUPTION ALL COME UP ALL CRESSMAN TESTED FROM THE STATES CONTAIN A PIZZA COMICAL CALLED FORD HOW ALSO WHICH WAS ACTUALLY PHASED BY THE FDA TWENTY TWO TO CONCERN ABOUT PROCESS OF FEEDBACK COMICAL INTERFOR. THE PRODUCT ACCEPTED THAT REMOTE LIKELY TO CONTAIN FOR WHAT APPROVED BY COLOR BUT- AND FROM THE- AND THESE ARE ALL THE MOST LIKELY TO RESULT IN HELP HARM BECAUSE OF THEIR USAGE. FOR EXAMPLE MASCARA IS APPLIED TO THE I AREA WORKING TO THE BODY FEATURE DOC PEOPLE WHO USE BUT THANK AN IMPORTANT COMPOUNDS THAT DOCTOR LIFE AND FOUNDATIONS APPLIED ACROSS THE ENTIRE FEE. IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING THE FACT ARE FOUND IN PRODUCTS THAT HAVE A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE ESPECIALLY THE CONCENTRATION COMMONLY FOUND IN COSMETICS OFTEN EXCEED SAFE DRINKING. WATER LEVEL. I THINK THE INCREDIBLE CARE PRODUCTS NOT ONLY A- BUT- HARMS PEOPLE OVERLY OTHER PARTS OF PRODUCTS USED BY WHO DON'T WEAR MAKE. SUCH AS WHO ARE MUCH- OUR THIRTY ALL DISCOVERED THAT MOST OF THE TIME FIFTY WERE NOT EVEN PRESENT INGREDIENTS FONG PRODUCT- LABEL WITHIN FEEDBACK HAD INCLUDED ON THE INC LIST ONE REASON FOR THIS BUT IF I SOME PEOPLE ASKING FROM INADVERTENT. THERE IN YOUR- AND IT HIM OCCURS BY THE WAY AND UNNECESSARY USE A FACT BUILT SUCH AS ONE. WHAT. OTHER KEY FACTS ARE TO MAKE UP INTENT. BUT ARE OFTEN LABEL WHICH MEANS THAT FOLKS CONSUMERS AND OUR COUNTRY AND INCOME. COULD NOT SHOOT PROTECT THEM. WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON WHY SUCH. IF NEED. AND AMONG FOLLOWING OUR RESEARCH EVEN MAIN MAKE COMPANIES LIKE KILEY. OR AND VOEPEL I PLEDGE THEIR NEW EATING WHEN CONTAIN PEOPLE. AND MIGHT. WORKING WITH COSMETICS. HELP THEM REMOVE ATHENEX BIKING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND OUR WEBSITE PEOPLE THE PRICE HOW THOUSANDS OF AGREEMENT. THE BOSTON BUT WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT IT CLEAR TO GO UP THEIR LIVES HAVING WORRY ABOUT THE PRODUCT USE ARE. ESPECIALLY THE THAT ARE CONTACT THEIR SKIN EVERY DAY. THE FINANCES CLEAR FEEDBACK FOR HER WELL THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT STUFF. AND DIFFERENT YOU. NO PEOPLE TO GETTING DETAIL BY FIND HAVE. HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO LOCK. THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE. OF STRONG. FLUORINE FONG DETER FUNCTION. BUT ALSO THE TERM HOW AND THEN BY. HARM WHICH IS WHY BANNING MEANS. CLASS OF PEOPLE. OF NECESSARY. TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF COLOR. MY THANK HAS BEEN I SUPPORT. A TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE FOR THE COUNTRY COULD GREATLY. THE HEALTH OF OUR CITIZENS AND THE- THANK YOU. THANK YOU- AT THE TIME ALASKA THERE'S ANY WAY IN THE HEARING. IN AB SEVEN SEVENTY ONE. KEN ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT AND ALSO REJOICING SINCE REGISTERING SUPPORT FOR CAMPAIGN FOR SAFE COSMETICS THANK YOU. FOR. WHAT WILL IT BE WITH ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. WHO KNEW WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN THE ROOM- THE OPPOSITION. THIS BILL FROM. OKAY YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN BERS MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL- TODAY I AM JOINED BY DR J. ANSELL WHO IS A PC PC'S VICE PRESIDENT OF COSMETIC PROGRAMS HE IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE- WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY IN AN- OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION WE APPRECIATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE HOWEVER WE ARE- STILL REMAIN AND- OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO. TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE. IN CONCEPT WE SUPPORT THE PHASE OUT OF FOSSIL COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. HOWEVER OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS A LACK OF NEW ONES AROUND WHAT IT IS EXACTLY THAT WERE BANDING. THIS BILL AS DRAFTED BANDS ALL P. FIVE SWITCH AS DEFINED CAPTURES ANYTHING THAT HAS FULLY FLUORINATED CARBON ATOMS. THIS WOULD CAPTURE OTHER FLUORIDES LIKE TFA WHICH ARE READY PRESENT IN THE WATER SUPPLY SO. CLAYS ETCETERA. TO BE CLEAR WE WILL NOT INTENTIONALLY ADD P. FIVE US INTO OUR PRODUCTS. HOWEVER IF COMPANIES ARE USING MINERALS AND WATER THERE MAY STILL BE TECHNICALLY UNAVOIDABLE TRACE LEVELS IN THE WATER AND THEREFORE GET INTO THE PRODUCT. THIS DOES TWO THINGS IT MAKES US LIABLE FOR INGREDIENTS THAT WE ARE NOT INTENTIONALLY ADDING INTO OUR PRODUCTS BUT ARE RATHER UBIQUITOUS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND NUMBER TWO. IT COULD PROHIBIT MANUFACTURERS FROM USING WATER OR OTHER NATURAL MINERALS AS A COSMETIC INGREDIENT AND JUST OF THE COMMITTEES A WHERE WATER IS THE SINGLE MOST USE INGREDIENTS IN COSMETICS. COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COMPANIES REMAIN COMMITTED TO ADVANCING INNOVATIVE PRODUKTIVNOST. AS ADDRESSED ABOVE. AND JUST AS A REMINDER IN TWENTY TWENTY PC PC AND A WIDE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS- JOINTLY SUPPORTED A PHASE OUT OF CERTAIN P. FOSS IN AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY TWO WHICH MOVED OUT OF THIS BODY. THIS LEGISLATION ONLINE CALIFORNIA LAW WITH THE E. U. M. ANNEXED TO FOR COSMETICS AND PROVIDED CONSISTENCY AND A PREDICTABLE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. WE ARE ASKING FOR THIS M. AND THE SPELL. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. ARE LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE NEGOTIATED IN AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY TWO. NUMBER ONE IT'S A IT'S A CONSISTENT DEFINITION OF INGREDIENT- NUMBER TWO AS MENTIONED EARLIER INTENTIONALLY ADDED IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. NUMBER THREE LANGUAGE AROUND- TECHNICALLY UNAVOIDABLE TRACE CONTAMINANTS MUST BE INCLUDED AS GUARDRAILS IN THE BILL. NUMBER FOUR WE'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE AN INTERNATIONAL DEFINITION OF P. FIVE US BECAUSE OUR MEMBERS OPERATE GLOBALLY ANDNO THOSE INTERNATIONAL DEFINITIONS AND RECOGNIZE THEM AND KNOW HOW TO COMPLY WITH THEM. NUMBER FOUR IS A SOUTH OF PERIOD SO THAT RETAILERS AREN'T BURDENED WITH HAVING TO DISPOSE OF THESE MATERIALS UPON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS BILL WHICH COULD. CREATE AN ENVIRONMENTAL- BURDEN BECAUSE THOSE PRODUCTS HAVE TO BE DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE. AND THEN FINALLY A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE THAT ALIGNS WITH AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY TWO ONCE AGAIN PASSED BY THIS BODY WHICH IS JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS AND THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU AND I WILL CALL ON DR J. ANSELL AFTER WE GET THROUGH WITH A WITNESSES AT A RENDERING SO WHO HAD COME FORWARD AND- HELLO. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON OF COOKING UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION. WHOSE MEMBERS INCLUDE BUSINESSES ACROSS THE AEROSOL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. AS WELL AS THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION WHICH IS THE LEAD FRAGRANT IT ASSOCIATION WITH MEMBERSHIP. COMPRISING OF BUSINESSES ACROSS THE FRAGRANCE OF POT CHAIN- IN ADDITION TO THE CONCERNS AND AMENDMENTS LAID OUT BY ME DEEPLY I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THE BROAD DEFINITION. OF P. FAST IN THIS BILL WOULD REMOVE HF FOES WHICH ARE USED AS AEROSOL PROPELLANTS FROM THE COSMETIC MARKET. AGE OF THOSE OF EMERGED AS IT. AN AEROSOL AT THAT THE U. S. EPA HAS DEEMED ACCEPTABLE AS IT RELATES TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. HFO IS A VERY LOW GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND REDUCE GROUND LEVEL OZONE FORMATION GIVING THEM AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REACHING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. FOR EXAMPLE THE HFO ONE TWO THREE FOUR Z. E. AEROSOL PROPELLANT IS VITAL FOR MANUFACTURERS TO HAVE AVAILABLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH UPCOMING LOWER VOC LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY CAR. IN CONTRAST TO BE FAST EACH OF THOSE ARE NOT PERSISTENT OR BIO ACCUMULATIVE FURTHER THE U. S. EPA'S WORKING DEFINITION FOR THEIR P. FOSS REPORTING ROLE. ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BY AN ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT INCLUDE HFO IS AN TO THE EPA'S MASTER LIST OF NINE THOUSAND P. FAST SUBSTANCES THAT WAS REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE HFO ONE TWO THREE FOUR Z. E. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AMENDMENT TO ALLOW THE USE OF EACH OPPOSE GIVEN THEIR ROLE IN ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL CLIMATE AMBITIONS. AND PROVIDING SAFE PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS IN HOPES OF ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS BUT TODAY WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF FOR MODERATOR DO WE HAVE DR J. ANSELL. WITH THE PC PC. ON THE PHONE LINE. YEAH YEAH AND THE LINE IS OPEN WITHIN SPECIFIC GIVING OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE AUTHOR AND- OKAY SERVICE. M. AT LEAST REMEMBER SERVICE THING THANKS FOR IN THE BILL I THINK I AM YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYBODY INCLUDING OPPOSITION FOR THOSE THAT WE HEARD FROM TODAY AGREE THAT- MORE P. FAST COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE LIST THAT WE PASSED UNDER MEROM STRATEGY FELL. IN A RIVER HAVE YEARS AGO I WAS- BUT I GUESS I'M A LITTLE BIT. I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THIS BILL ISN'T SORT OF USING THE SAME FRAMEWORK AND JUST ADDING THOSE P. FAST TO MR MERCER TWO THREE MARKETING WORK FOR TWO YEARS ON I THINK. WE GOT TO A REALLY GOOD PLACE. WELL BECAUSE- THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND WHAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS IS THAT THE FORMULA A- BILL CHANGE A LITTLE BIT OF THE FORMULATION BUT ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE STILL DOING. THE FAUCET. SO IT'S BETTER TO WHAT IT COMES TO LARGE CLASSES OF CHEMICALS LIKE THIS TO ADDRESS THEM AS A CLASS. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH FOR THEM TO TWEAK IT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S ON THE LIST HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE LONG PROCESS AGAIN. OKAY THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT HASN'T WORKED TO DO IT SORT OF ONE BY ONE. SO COULD WE HAVE THE WHOLE CLASS OF P. FIVE TO THE FRAMEWORK CREATED BY THE- I. WHATEVER THE NUMBER WITH A CUSTOMER SEARCHES FELL TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SIX YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THAT BILL TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT IS A LINE- BUT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TRYING TO ADD TO. THE CLASS OF CHEMICALS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW EVEN AFTER THAT THE OLDER STILL. RIGHT WAY TOO MUCH OF THIS IN THE PRODUCTS AND IT'S STILL GETTING INTO THE WATER. SO WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AN YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION TO REALLY FROM ALL THAT OUT. AND I AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND- AS I SAID. WHEN I BEGAN I HAVE. A SUPPORT I GUESS. YOU KNOW PART OF WHAT I THINK WORK THIS COMMITTEE WORKED. HARD ON IN THAT PROCESS AND IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THIS. WAS THIS PIECE ABOUT. YOU KNOW THAT AT. WITH WE COMMENTED ON ABOUT. THE YOU KNOW THE UNINTENTIONALLY ADDED THAT YOU KNOW THE PARTS THAT ARE COMING FROM SAY WATER OTHER INGREDIENTS AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE- YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- DOING THAT WHICH I THINK. MR RESEARCH YOU DID A GOOD JOB OF MAKING SURE WAS DONE IN THE END OF HIS BILL BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE NOW BACK TO SQUARE ONE AND I'M JUST FEELING LIKE. WHY RE WE RENEGOTIATING. VINEGARS YEAH. BACK TO SQUARE ONE I FEEL LIKE WE'RE BUILDING ON THE- EXCELLENT WORK THAT HE DID. IS REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. FORGET AT OKAY DO IT SO I GUESS I'D WANT TO HEAR FROM OF YOU I ARE YOU COMMITTEE TO GETTING TO BASICALLY WHERE WE GOT TO IN TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH WAS INSURING THAT THOSE FILES THAT ARE NOT INTENSELY ADDED THAT ARE JUST IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT END UP IN THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT PART OF WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON. DIFFERENT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COSMETIC INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS INTENTIONALLY ADDED ACCOUNT WE DON'T WANNA YOU KNOW WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT SORT OF THIS LOOPHOLE AND HE COULDN'T THEY THEY CAN JUST SAY HEY WE DON'T MEAN TO SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM AND YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE LETTER OF SUPPORT THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF COSMETIC COMPANIES HAVE SIGNED ON IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL- AND- AS YOU HEARD EVEN THE OPPOSITION. I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO THIS THEY KNOW THERE'S STILL A PROBLEM SO WE'RE WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING WORKING WITH THEM AND THE FACT THAT I DID REACH OUT TO THEM BEFORE WE EVEN STEP TO SAY WE'RE THINKING OF DOING THIS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND- WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM AND I THINK I'M BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD PARTNERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS DOABLE FOR THAT WE'RE NOT HOW TO DO A GUY. WE WANT TO PUSH THEM. ALL THE MANUFACTURER. WE CLING. THEIR ACT. BECAUSE NONE OF US. WE ALL WANT TO. HELLO THOUGH HE BUYS A- ON THE SHOW. HERE THAT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT HURTING OURSELVES. ARE HEARD AND WATER SUPPLIES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. SEVEN CAN YOU ADDRESS THE- M. TICKET. THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY TALKED. CHAU WHICH I'D NEVER. BEFORE READING THE ANALYSIS OF THE HONEST- BUT- ARE WE ADDRESSING THAT CONCERN. ANALYSIS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S- POSING THE SAME CONCERN THE P. FIVE SAYS. SO WE FEEL THAT THE EVEN THOUGH INNER DIDN'T REFRIGERATE AND REFRIGERATE INDUSTRY THESE ARE SAFE PRODUCTS BUT THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE THAT WHETHER YOU SOME PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT COME IN CONTACT WITH WATER THEY TURN INTO ANOTHER MATERIAL. WHICH IS CALLED TFA WHICH DOES HAVE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS SO WE'RE SAYING FINE USE THAT IN YOUR REFRIGERATION PRODUCTS BUT LET'S NOT PUT INTO PRODUCTS THAT WERE SPRING ON OUR BODIES THAT END UP NEXT IN WATER. BECAUSE THOSE HEALTH IMPACTS IT'S NOT SO CLEAR ABOUT THAT SO BENIGN. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE BECAUSE THERE ARE KNOWN ALTERNATIVES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE USED. AT OUR STATE WHICH IS COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN. AND ALSO THE OF THE H. OPPOSE ARE NOT. MEDICS AT THIS POINT SO YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO DISRUPT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN COSMETICS WE JUST DON'T WANT THEM TO BE USED UNTIL WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE REALLY SAFE YOU KNOW IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. VERITY AND VERITY BEING I DON'T KNOW AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE BEING USED IN AEROSOLS RIGHT WHICH ARE YOU. KNOW THEY'RE NOT. OKAY SURE. SURE IF I COULD- EACH OF THOSE ARE JUST NOW BEING- THE PLAN IS TO INTRODUCE THEM AS AN AEROSOL. AND ACCORDING TO EWG HAS ITS LARGE SKIN DEEP DATABASE AND WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND. PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE- INGREDIENTS FOR AND WE DID A POLL OF THAT. AND FOUND THAT ONLY TWO OF THOSE PRODUCTS CONTAINED IT H. F. O.'S OKAY. AND SO IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING- FROM. TALKING WITH THE MANUFACTURERS THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE POISED TO BRING INTO THE MARKET AND SO WE WOULD JUST HOPE THAT THEY WOULD. MAYBE TRY TO PIT YOU KNOW AWAY BECAUSE IT IT DOES ACTUALLY BREAK DOWN INTO ANOTHER TYPE OF P. FAST WHICH IS THE TFA THAT IS A PERSISTENT CHEMICAL. IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE CONCERNED WILL CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE CONTACT M. AS A CHILD OF THE EIGHTIES WHO LEFT MY HAIR SPRAY. AND REMEMBERS WHEN WE ALL HAD TO GET RID OF OUR AEROSOL HAIRSPRAY IS BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON. THE VARMINTS- AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR FRIEDMAN IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENT JUST MAKING SURE THAT IT ISN'T SORT OF A MORE BENEFICIAL. USE THE WORD WEIGHING ALL OF THE- THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING HERE YET- THE TFA IS VERSUS THE IMPACT THAT THESE PRODUCTS HAVE A MUCH. LARGER GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION WAS THE AND THE QUESTION ABOUT THE SELL THROUGH DATE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE. HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE TIME FOR THESE INDUSTRIES TO. GET RID OF WHAT'S ALREADY ON THE SHELVES ARE IN THE MARKET WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM. YEAH. WITH A HUGE HAZARDOUS WASTE PROBLEM. OUT LAUGHING. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A SIMILAR POWER QUE HAN I DID SEE THE OPPOSITION FLINCH OUT THERE BUT I'M GONNA GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYOR SEARCHING FOR RESPONSIBLE. THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO THANK A- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR. TRYING TO FINISH TO WHAT I CONSIDER UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF EFFORT FROM MY BILL FROM TWENTY TWENTY- YOU KNOW THE SAME. SCIENCE APPLIES TO- B. A CLASS OF P. FOSS THAT THAT YOUR- SEEKING TO BAN- AS AS THE CHEMICALS FOR MY TWENTY TWENTY BILL ON THAT THE SAME. CANCER CAUSING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HARMING. DEVELOPMENT DISABILITY CAUSING- PROPENSITIES OF THESE CHEMICALS- HEY I JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR FOR THE- FOR THIS COMMITTEE THAT- THAT- YOU KNOW THE ONLY REASON WHY WE DIDN'T INCLUDE THESE AND OUR EARLIER BILL WAS BECAUSE- OUR EARLIER OUR REGIONAL VERSION OF OUR BILL. DIED IN THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE AND SO WAS IT WAS A MORE OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE OF THE POLITICS RATHER THAN THE POLICY- BUT I AM FULLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. YOU'RE TRYING TO REPAIR IT THANK THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU THE OPPOSITION WANT TO SAY I'VE SEEN SOME MOVEMENT BACK THERE. WE CALLING WITNESSES BACK UP YES SHE PICKED SHE HAS TO BE CALLED BACK UP SO YES. GO AHEAD. I JUST M. IT REALLY ANSWERED IT BUT YES WE ARE MOVING INTO HFO IS FOR MANUFACTURING OF SOME AEROSOL PRODUCTS AND AS A MEMBER FRIEDMAN DID MENTION COMPRESSED GAS IS AN OPTION IN SOME PRODUCT THAT'S NOT ALL- I WILL NOTE THAT WITHOUT- THIS HFO WHICH IS REPLACING THE HSCS DUE TO A TWO YEAR. MAYBE THREE YEAR- REGULATORY PROCESS WE CONDUCTED A CARB OUT WITHOUT IT- MANUFACTURES MAY HAVE TO MOVE TO BUTANE- WHICH IS FLAMMABLE BUT WOULD NOT BE CAUGHT UP BY THIS BILL SO- AGAIN JUSTIN WEIGHING THOSE ALTERNATIVES- AT THE POSSIBILITY. THANK YOU FOR. I DO HAVE A LOOK I DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. AND THEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. IN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. OKAY- I'M SO SORRY BUT THAT'S OKAY OFFER TO CLOSE JUST THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO INDUSTRY AND YOU KNOW AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS WORKABLE FOR EVERYBODY. AND I APPRECIATE THEIR COUNCIL AND THEIR PARTNERSHIP SO FAR ON THE BILL. AND I WOULD REDUCE ASPIRIN AYE VOTES THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION THANK YOU. I DON'T GET THIS POSITION TOO OFTEN SO EXCUSE ME. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL COMPLEX I WERE TO GET TO CLOSE AS WELL. IN THE SAME BOAT. SURE AND AT YOUR- HELLO AS YOU IN ASPECTS. HAS TO MENTION THAT IS OUR IN A AYE VOTE. I DON'T FOUR BEACH SEVEN SEVENTY. FRIEDMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH CORK. HI SMITH. NO WITH THIS TIME BUT LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION SMITH NO ARAMBULA. REGULAR I'D STARKEY HAD. OKAY HAND I CRISTINA GARCIA MATHIS MURATSUCHI MURATSUCHI AYE WALDRON. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. OKAY. BUT SO FAR. LAST FILM OF THE DAY I THOUGHT IT WAS NEXT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THE FORWARD YEAH. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER K. HAND NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDES PROHIBITED NON AGRICULTURAL USE THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY STRONG CLARIFICATION THERE AND I WANT TO THINK THAT CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK ON THIS BILL OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND WE'VE REALLY BEEN A PARTNERSHIP FOR COULD THINK GIVEN MAYBE A YEAR- TO TRY TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND I THINK IT'S IN A REALLY GOOD PLACE AND THAT'S IN LARGE PART DUE TO YOUR EFFORTS SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. AT SO BECAUSE OF THE COMMITTEES THAT REQUEST I WANT TO BE CLEAR I'M ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS TO BETTER REFLECT THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS MOVING TO RESTRICT. AN ASSOCIATION CLARIFY USES ONLY. AND SHORING UP THE EMERGENCY YOU MEAN NON AGRICULTURAL NOT A GREAT THANK YOU. BAKER CULTURALLY THAT. M. SO WE'RE HERE TODAY REALLY TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS A PROBLEM PLAGUING CALIFORNIA AND TO BE FRANK THE ENTIRE WORLD WHICH IS AB THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE KILLING OUR BEE POPULATION WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO BIODIVERSITY BUT ALSO TO OUR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY- CALIFORNIA BEEKEEPERS LOST OVER ONE OF THE WORST YEARS ON RECORD. EVIDENCE IS MOUNTING THAT THIS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY PESTICIDES AND SPECIFICALLY THE CLASS OF PESTICIDES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY NEONICOTINOIDS LHASA POLLINATORS ENDANGERS UPWARDS OF ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN STATE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND IS ALREADY LIMITING DEALS AND DRIVING UP FOOD PRICES THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BEES TO POLLINATE OUR PLANTS FOOD IS HARDER TO GROW AND PRICES RISE AND RIGHT NOW WITH PRICES RISING ALREADY IN FOOD AND OTHER NECESSITIES IT'S REALLY CRITICAL WE DO WHAT WE CAN. TO PROTECT OUR FOOD CROPS CALIFORNIA HAS A ROBOT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR REGULATING PESTICIDES AND A PERMANENT SIDE REGULATIONS HAS ALREADY INCREASED RESTRICTIONS OF NEONICOTINOIDS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SETTING. THAT'S WHY WE'RE FOCUSED ON NOT AGRICULTURAL HERE TODAY- AND THOSE ARE THE GAPS THAT WE SEE FOR THE USE OF THESE CHEMICALS NEONICOTINOID USE ON LAWNS GARDENS AND GOLF COURSES IS ALMOST ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY USERS COVER THEIR PROPERTY WITH GRANULES AND WATER THEM INTO THE SOIL MANY LONDONERS DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING THE CHEMICALS PROCEED TO SEEP INTO THE WATER SUPPLY TRAVEL TRIP TO SPENDING IT'S AN ABSORBENT PLAN THAT. NADER'S CONSUME. COMMENTS ARE LEARN AS A I NEED AND ARE A- BUT ALTERNATIVES LIKE DYNAMITE THAT CAN REPLACE NEAR NEXT WHEN NECESSARY. THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUED THAT THE BILL LIMITS NECESSARY USE OF NEONICS IN ADDITION TO THESE NON ALTERNATIVES I WANNA BE CLEAR ABOUT THE WHAT THE BILL EXEMPTS THE BILL INCLUDES EXEMPTIONS TO ALLOW FOR EXTERMINATION USE USE FOR INVASIVE SPECIES AND OTHER NECESSARY USES THE POSE LIMITED RISK TO POLLINATORS. OTHER COUNTRIES AND STATES WE WON'T BE THE FIRST DAY AND THEN YOU NEED TO DO THIS HAVE ALREADY RECOGNIZE THE HARMS OF NEONICS. THEY ALREADY ARE BANNED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR NEARLY ALL USES THE NEW JERSEY HAS BANDS THEIR NON AGRICULTURAL USE IN EXACTLY THE WAY WERE CONTEMPLATING TODAY. IT'S TIME THE CALIFORNIA CATCHES UP WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD TO ADDRESS THE LOSS OF OUR POLLINATORS AND THE HEALTH OF OUR ENVIRONMENT WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT ARE ANDREA WILLIAMS DIRECTOR BIO DIVERSITY INITIATIVES. FOR THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY AND LUCAS ROADS AN ATTORNEY WITH THE NRDC POLLINATOR PROGRAM WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. ARE VERY GOOD AND THEY'RE ON THE PHONE LINE. YES ALL RIGHT- WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK FIRST. AT ANDREA ANDREA UP YOU SHOULD HAVE A LIFELINE. AND IF YOU WELL LET'S START TAKE YOURSELF OFF MUTE AND START SPEAKING WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD AFTERNOON TWENTY MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANDREA WILLIAMS I'M THE DIRECTOR BY THE NATION'S FOR THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY.

AND INCREASE THE BILL TO PARASITES. THANK SISTER GENERATION. I AM ON THE PHONE OF THE FOOD WEB THE AND THE EFFECTS ARE SEEN IN FISH REPTILES CROSS ENAMEL INCLUDE WAKE TIRE MORTALITY RATES PARTICULAR FOR YOUNG ANIMALS- WERE WITH COMMUNITIES WITH LEARNED THAT THE MAIN REASON MANY PEOPLE GARDEN WITH PLANTS WHICH TO CREATE HAVOC. FOR BIRDS ABOUT A ANOTHER WOULD BE. THAT'S WHY MANY OF THE NATIVE PLANTS IS A LOT ABOUT THE NUMBERS OF ALLOCATED AGAINST UNIX WHICH THE YEAR. YES SUPPORTERS BILL WHICH MAKES IT EASY FOR PEOPLE ON AND HARM AND- I THINK THE CAN FOR THEIR ATTENTION AND I BELIEVE WITH THIS ON THE LINE TO OTHER CONTENT- HELP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANDREA OUR NEXT FOR LOW. ROWE AND ARE. PLEASE GO AHEAD MISTER KIRK YOU HEAR ME ARE YEAH YEAH. THE FACT THAT I GET UP TO MEMBERS OF THE AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING UP THIS CRITICAL BILL HI MY NAME IS LUCAS ROAD CONTEST ON BEHALF OF AN RDC AND ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA- URGE THE COMMITTEE TO ADVANCE AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SIX. FOLLOW PETE MADE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION NEW JERSEY AND MAINE THE BAN ON HARMFUL AND UNNECESSARY USES OF NEONICS HAVE BEEN GREAT I'VE EXPLAINED MUNICH'S HAVE WIDESPREAD ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS THEY'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE LEADING CAUSE OF BEE DECLINES FRIGHTENING POLLINATOR SERVICES THAT SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. ALSO WHEN COULD NOT THE- CLUB AQUATIC KEEP. AND EVEN BIRTH DFECTS IN WHITE TAILED DEER. OUTDOOR NON AGRICULTURAL USES TARGETED BY THIS BILL ARE CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THIS CRISIS. WHAT ARE CUTTING BACK CALIFORNIA DPR HAS FOUND AT LEAST ONE UNIT IN 92% OF SURFACE WATER SAMPLES IN URBAN AREAS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STRONGLY SUGGESTING THAT NON AGRICULTURAL USES OF NEONICS ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF POLLUTION. IT ALSO PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF UBIQUITOUS CONTAMINATION OF NOT JUST CALIFORNIA'S BORDER BUT ALSO IT'S SO IT'LL AND PLANT LIFE. INSEMINATION EVEN EXTENDS TO OUR BODIES CDC MONITORING SHOWS THAT HALF OF AMERICANS ARE EXPOSED TO NEONICS ON ANY GIVEN DAY BUT THE HIGHEST LEVELS FOUND IN CHILDREN. RESEARCH INDICATES INCREASINGLY INDICATE CAUSE FOR CONCERN ABOUT EXPOSURE TO THESE NEUROTOXIC CHEMICALS. MEDINA LOGICAL STUDIES LINKING UNIX WITH INCREASED RISK OF MALFORMATIONS OF THE DEVELOPING HEART AND BRAIN AND RODENT STUDIES LINKING THE ANNEX WITHIN OUR LOGICAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HARMS. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW NEEDLESS EXPOSURE TO THESE CHEMICALS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NON AGRICULTURAL USES ARE UNNECESSARY FOR REPLACEABLE. BECAUSE NEONICS ARE SYSTEMIC THEY'RE ALMOST ALWAYS APPLIED PREVENTIVELY BEFORE THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE OF A PATH PROBLEM SO IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST ALTERNATIVE TO USING NEONICS IS NOTHING. BUT EVEN WHERE THERE THE PAST PROBLEM THERE ARE OTHER EFFECTIVE AND LESS HARMFUL OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR ALL THESE REASONS NRDC STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND REQUEST HER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- NEXT I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE PRIMARY- WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. AND. LET'S SEE I HAVE PLEASE COME FORWARD. YEAH YEAH I JUST THAT HAVE A SEAT WE LIKE TO SEE YOU. YOU'RE ONE OF OUR FRIENDS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CHAIR MEMBERS KNOW COOKING UNITS AGAIN HERE AGAIN ON THAT- BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WHOSE MEMBER COMPANIES MANUFACTURE NON AGRICULTURAL USE NEONICOTINOID BASED PRODUCTS OTHER USED TO CONTROL PESTS SUCH AS BED BUGS FLIES- STINK BUGS COCKROACHES- CERTAIN INVASIVE SPECIES AND- CONTROLLING PAT PASSED- INSECTS SUCH AS FLEAS AND TICKS- CONSUMER PASS PRODUCTS ALLOW CALIFORNIANS THE ABILITY TO CLEAN AND PROTECT THEIR HOMES AGAINST A VARIETY OF PUBLIC HEALTH PASS WITH SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PRODUCTS WITHOUT ACCESS TO SUCH PRODUCTS. CONSUMERS MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN TAKING NO ACTION AGAINST THESE PASS OR PAYING SOMEONE TO PERFORM THOSE SERVICES AS THE ANALYSIS EXPLAINS AN APPLICATION OF NEARLY SIX- HAVE BEEN EVALUATED BY THE U. S. EPA ANTI PR FOR BOTH ECOLOGICAL AND HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS AND THE EPA IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING REGISTRATION REVIEW OF THE CLASS OF NEW ANNEX AND EXPECTED TO FINALISE EVALUATIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SIX ADDRESS THE USES OF MUNICH PRODUCTS THAT WERE NOT A PART OF DPR IS A VALUATION. AT WHICH LOOKS AT OUR CULTURAL USES IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT DPR CHOSE NOT TO EVALUATE- RISK IS TO INDOOR USES STRUCTURAL USES AND NON AGRICULTURAL OUTDOOR USES SUCH AS LAWNS GARDENS AND GOLF COURSES. DUE TO LACK OF POLLINATOR EXPOSURE- I. E. NOT ATTRACTIVE TO BEES NO FOOD SOURCES FOR BEES TO FEED ON AND LOWER USE RATES OR LACK OF WIDESPREAD USE ABOUT A QUOTE FROM A DOCUMENT THAT THEY PUT OUT. THAT WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL HOWEVER WOULD NOTE THAT WHILE THE BILL EXEMPTS PRODUCTS USED ON. PETS TO TREAT FLEAS AND TICKS PRODUCTS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE USED ON PLANTS WHERE THOSE FLEAS AND TICKS LIVE AND ARE PICKED UP BY PETS AND BROUGHT INTO THE HOME. THEREFORE LEAVING CONSUMERS WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PREVENT FLEA AND TICK INFESTATIONS. WE SUPPORT INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE POLITY- HEALTH AND BELIEVE IT ITS COMPS GROWTH COMPLEXITY CALLS FOR THOUGHTFUL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGE SOLUTIONS WE ALSO SUPPORT CONTINUED RESEARCH ON THE REST TO BE HEALTH AND READILY ACKNOWLEDGE. THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF POLLINATORS TO OUR ECOSYSTEM AND ECONOMY. HOWEVER IN RECOGNITION OF THE WORK BY THE USEPA AND THE LACK OF ADEQUATE SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SIX THANK. VERY GOOD. GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIDGE THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL- AND A NUMBER OF OTHER AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS WESTERN PLANT HEALTH ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS. IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- AND WANT TO FIRST EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR- AND- CLEARLY THE INTENT THAT SHE'S MADE TO- NOT TO BRING AGRICULTURAL USES INTO THE BILL. I DO BELIEVE THAT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS HELP MOVE IT IN THAT DIRECTIONS BY TAKING OUT THE LANGUAGE DEALING WITH RESTRICTED. USE PRODUCTS. HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BILL IS THE WAY IT'S- SET UP. PRIMARY CONCERN AT THIS POINT IS THE- LANGUAGE IN THE BILL DEALING WITH THE EMERGENCY- AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENT EMERGENCY. HOW IT OULD PUT TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. IN THE LEAD OF ACTUALL DETERMINE WHEN THERE IS A PASSED EMERGENCY. HI DPR THEY'RE GREAT WHAT THEY DO BUT THEY'RE TOXICOLOGIST THEY'RE NOT ENTOMOLOGISTS. AND SO IT'S CDFA- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE THE DETERMINES INVASIVE PESTS LOOKS AT INVASIVE PRESS PROGRAMS. ESTABLISHES QUARANTINES ESTABLISH MEDICATION MEASURES- THAT DEALS WITH THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES AND SO. I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE A REALLY RE THOUGHT ABOUT- IF WE'RE MOVING DOWN THAT PATHWAY. THEN WE HAVE THE EXAMPLE OF THE CALIFORNIA'S CITRUS INDUSTRY- THAT- REALLY HAS THIS INTERFACE WITH URBAN USE OF PRODUCTS. HOW WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THE ASIAN CITRUS PSYLLID WHICH TRANSMITS ONE LONG BANG FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THERE ARE MORE BACKYARD CITRUS TREES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEN THERE ARE CITRUS TREES IN PRODUCTION. AND IT'S THOSE BACKYARD CITRUS TREES WERE WE FOUND THAT THEY HARBOR AND THEY SPREAD THE ASIAN CITRU PSYLLID. AND SO WE IN THE CITRUS INDUSTRY HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE LAST DECADE. ON A PROGRAM THAT DOES EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO THOSE CONSUMERS TO BETTER PROTECT THEIR TREES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR THAT. NOT ONLY SO CONSUMERS CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE BACK ARE COME CHRIS AT. CITRUS TREES. BUT THAT THEY DON'T CREATE THAT ADDITIONAL HARM. AND EXPOSURE- TO THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR COMMERCIAL CITRUS INDUSTRY. AND OUR FINAL POINT WOULD BE MORE ON JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PRINCIPLE WE DO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION IT IS WORLD RENOWNED. FOR ITS TOXICOLOGIST AND THE MITIGATION MEASURES IN THE SCIENCE THAT ARE PUT INTO THE REGISTRATION OF PRODUCTS AFTER A PRODUCT IS REGISTERED AT USEPA IT TAKES ANOTHER THREE TO FIVE YEARS. ANOTHER TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO REGISTER THAT PRODUCT FOR THE USE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF WE THINK THAT THEY'RE RE. MISSED THE MARK- AS IT RELATES TO THESE PRODUCTS THEN LET'S ASK THEM TO DO IT AGAIN THEY CHOSE NOT TO USE TO LOOK AT THE NON AGRICULTURAL USES BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THE RISK WAS LOW. IF YOU THE LEGISLATURE DISAGREED WITH THAT RATHER THAN TAKING THE CHEMISTRY AND TAKEN THE SCIENCE INTO YOUR HANDS LET'S DIRECT THEM TO GO BACK AND DO WHAT THEY'RE PAID TO DO REEVALUATE THAT SCIENCE AND COME BACK TO ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS. USE RESTRICTIONS EXCEPT FOR IF THAT THE SCIENCE LEAD TO MINUTE DIRECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL. CAN FOR MY OKAY SORRY FOR ALL OPEN THE ROOM TO TESTIMONY FIRST THAT'S IN FAVOR AND THEN IMPOSED. GOOD AFTERNOON MELISSA LEVY WITH ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA AS A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL BE- IN STRONG SUPPORT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE ON THEIR BEHALF THANK YOU.

ABOUT SORT OF OUR CONCERNS AND I KNOW YOU JUST AMENDED A BILL AND WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH- THAT VERY MUCH BUT WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS OF HOW THE SCIENCE I DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR EXEMPTION A ONE IN FOUR FEET. NUMBER ROSSOW CONCERNED ABOUT THE ROLE OF DPR WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF HAVE HAVEN'T SPENT A LOT TIME FOR MYSELF IT'S THE DEFINITIVE PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT IN THE COUNTRY SO WE THINK IT'S SUPPORT WHAT THEY DO AS WELL. I THINK WE ALSO WANT TO WITH AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AS WELL SO- WE WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AS WE PROCEED FOR THIS BILL AND HOPE THAT- WE COULD MAY RESOLVE SOME ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT LENGTH AS WELL SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

DR RAMBLING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M GONNA START- I WAS QUITE MOVED BY THE COMMENTS ABOUT NEEDING TO HELP TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR BEE POPULATION AS THE AUTHOR OF THE APIARY PROTECTION ACT WE PASSED IN. TWENTY NINETEEN AND BEFORE THAT THE B. WHERE PROGRAM WE WORKED AT I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE THOSE POLLINATORS PLAY- I DID WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON WHY WE WOULD NOT I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL HERE TODAY IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE. WHY WOULD A NASTY PR TO EVALUATE NON AG YOU. CONCLUSION I. THINK IT'S LOGICAL FOR US TO. ASK THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S MADE AN ASSESSMENT WHY THEY DIDN'T JUST IN TRYING TO GET CLARITY ON THAT- SAUCE EVERYTHING BOTH THE COMMITTEE AND I HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PAIR ABOUT THIS BILL AND I. I DON'T KNOW THAT MY ASSESSMENT MY CONVERSATIONS ALIGNS WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY THINK THIS IS A NECESSARY I'LL SAY THAT- THEY HAVE DONE INCREDIBLE WORK IN THE AGRICULTURAL SPACE WHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF SMITH. THAT'S WHAT I RECALLED HER IN REALLY DEALING WITH SORT OF TIME OF YEAR SPRAY RIGHT SO WHEN WE DON'T EXPECT FLOWERS THEY ALLOW IT WHEN WE DO HAVE FULL POWERS THEY DON'T BECAUSE THAT REALLY ALIGNS WITH. PROJECT MANAGERS YOU THIS IS BEING USED IN OUR I'M NOT A- REAL SETTINGS WHICH IS. LOOSELY PUT ON YOUR GRASS GLASSFORD LONG. AND THEN. LAUGHED RATE IS IT JUST DOESN'T ALIGN WITH THE SAME WAY WE SEE AGRICULTURE. I'M GOING TO TELL USERS DOING IT JUST THEY OPERATE DIFFERENTLY THAN ARE AT HOME SO IT DIDN'T FIT INTO THE SCHEME THEY WERE USING AND THEY WERE GOING DOWN THIS PATH. IT IS NOW BEEN. OF SINCE THEY STARTED THE PROCESS FOR OUR CULTURAL USES AND THEY'RE GETTING THERE THEY'RE NOT THERE YET BUT THEY'RE GETTING THERE AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE TOUCHING IT WE THINK THEY'RE DOING A FINE JOB- BUT THEY HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED DISCUSSING THIS AND I'VE I AM PERPLEXED AND I DID REACH OUT AS I THINK THE OPPOSITION INDICATED I REACHED OUT TO OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT I'M NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT TARGETING THEM IN THIS BILL WE BELIEVE THIS IS BENEFICIAL FOR CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY THEY NEED THESE BEES AND AS YOU HEARD. FROM OUR WITNESS WHEN YOU'RE FINDING NEW UNIX IN 92% OF WATER SAMPLES COMING OUT OF LOS ANGELES IT IS PREVALENT AND SO IT IS GOING TO BE STILL JUST IN ONE AREA. THE WE BELIEVE BELIEVE THIS IS BENEFITS. FOR AGRICULTURE. TO SAY TO BE. DOING THIS AT HOME. NOT TO DO IT AND THEN AGAIN TO ALLOW IT UNDER THE PR SYSTEM FOR THOSE THAT NEED A NAP CULTURAL SETTING. AND WE DID AND I WILL SPEAK ALSO TO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT INVASIVE SPECIES- WHICH WAS ADDRESSED AN INJURED. YOU'RE CHOOSING LAW THEY HAVE DIFFERENT BASIC SPECIES BUT THE- PROBLEM. HE SAID. WELL AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT AND WILL BECAUSE WE TRY TO ATTEMPT THAT WE THOUGHT WE DID A GOOD JOB BUT YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST. SO THIS. ISN'T WHAT. WE DO. SAID CAL. I LOOK. AT IT. TO OWN TODAY. BUT HLB. FOR CITRUS. P. AND AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY HEARING OUR STATE QUITE A SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT BEING RESOLVED BUT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BELTWAY THANK. VERY GOOD DO YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT A MORE. VERY GOOD. OTHER COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. THAT ALL RIGHT SO I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S NOT ONLY POLLINATORS AND EVEN WELL IN GERMANY THEY KNOW THAT ABOUT 30% OF THEIR- OF THEIR INSECTS TOTAL INSECT POPULATION HAS GONE DOWN. THE INSECTS ARE AT THE BASE OF THE FOOD CHAIN. WINDOW IN THE US WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME SORT OF LONG TERM LOOK AT INSECTS WE NEED ANY OF THAT. THE BIRD POPULATION FROM USING THE DOPPLER RADAR IS DOWN THIRTY PERCENT. GOOD ONE OF THOSE IS LIKELY TO BE THE FACT THAT THESE INSECTS THAT. WE DON'T WANT CERTAIN PLACES REALLY NEED TO BE IN OTHER PLACES TO SUPPORT THE BIRD POPULATION AND OTHER POPULATIONS THIS IS A BASE OF THE FOOD CHAIN. IT IS VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT THE NEO NECKS ARE ENDEMIC IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT IS A REALLY BIG PROBLEM- THE AUTHOR IS DEDICATED TO MAKING SURE. THAT THE OUR OUR ARMS GROWS ARE CITRUS GROVES ARE PER ARE AND YOU KNOW IT IN TERMS OF THE OPPOSITION YOU HAVE TO BUT ASK. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE I KNOW. AND A VERY GOOD LEGISLATOR SHE WAS BORN TO BE A LEGISLATOR- I AM SURE. THAT THE- THAT WE WILL END UP WITH THE BILL THAT PROTECTS OUR CITRUS OUR AGRICULTURE ENTERING CHECKS NOT JUST POLLINATORS BUT ALL OF THEM THEY ARE THE BASE OF THE FOOD CHAIN. SO MR SECRETARY.
