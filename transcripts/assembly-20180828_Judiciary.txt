WE WILL BE A OPERATING AS SUBCOMMITTEE WE DON'T QUITE GET HAVE A QUORUM OF PLEASE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. STR TWENTY NINE CALLS UPON THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO ISSUE A FORMAL APOLOGY TO ALL IMMIGRANT DETAINEES WHO HAVE BEEN FORCIBLY SEPARATED FROM THE PARENTS. THE RESULT OF OUR BORDER POLICIES FOLLOWING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ISSUED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP IN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND A MEMO BY THE TOURNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS IN APRIL THIS YEAR THE UNITED STATES HAS INSTITUTED. IT'S CALLED A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY REGARD TO IMMIGRANT VIOLATIONS. HOWEVER THIS AND PRESENT IN HUMANE POLICY HAS LED DIRECTLY LEAD TO THE FORCIBLE SEPARATION OF OVER. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IMMIGRANT INFANTS AND CHILDREN OR FROM THEIR PARENTS TO REMAIN IN CUSTODY WHILE AWAITING TRIAL. WELL SUPPORTERS OF THE POLICY OF CLAIM THAT'S MERELY ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAW LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE. THE HIGH COMMISSIONER HAS STATED THAT FAMILY SEPARATION THEMSELVES SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD. ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THE PRESIDENT AMERICAN CAN BE PEDIATRICS HAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT THIS THAT THIS IS GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED CHILD ABUSE. SO EVEN THOUGH THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY MEMBER STATE NOT TO HAVE RATIFIED THE CONVENTION THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD THE UNITED NATIONS HAS STATED THAT SINCE WE SIGNED. THAT SINCE WE TIED AN INTERNATIONAL COURT WE DO HAVE SOME LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO CHILDREN A CUSTODY. ASIDE FROM THE INHERENT CRUELTY OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES THERE'S ALSO CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH SHOWING THEIR SIGNIFICANT PROLONGED HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS AND CHILDHOOD. IF YOU ARE TWENTY NINE FIRST SEEKS TO HIGHLIGHT THE OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS AMONG RESEARCHERS THAT PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO TOXIC STRESS FX SHORT AND LONG TERM HEALTH. WHILE MOST OF US ARE LIKELY WHERE THE POTENTIAL MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS SUCH AS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. THERE ALSO LONG TERM SERIOUS PHYSICAL HARMS ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESSIVE CHILDHOOD STRESS IN FACT ON GOINGS AND EXPOSURE TO STRESS CAN ACTUALLY DISRUPT THE FORMATION OF THE CHILD'S BRAIN ARCHITECTURE. AND CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. SECOND S. YOU ARE TWENTY NINE CALLS UPON THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO FORMALLY APOLOGIZE NOT ONLY FOR THE SEPARATION FAMILIES BUT ALSO FOR TO PROLONG INCREASED HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMAGE UNIMAGINABLE STRESS. EXPERIENCED BY THOSE WHO CAN SEPARATE FROM THEIR FAMILIES. NOW THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN A LEADER AND SETTING STANDARDS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE WORLD AND THAT WE HAVE -- ALWAYS SAID THAT WE ARE EXCEPTIONAL IN OUR OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IN TERMS OF UPHOLDING THIS HIGHER STANDARD IN FACT BECAUSE OF THAT -- THE UNITED STATES ALSO I ISSUED FORMAL APOLOGIES FOR OUR PAST -- HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS CERTAINLY WE ARE NOT PERFECT BUT WE RECOGNIZE OUR HEIRS -- AT SOME OF THE EXAMPLES INCLUDE RONALD REAGAN'S THAT ARE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT APOLOGY FOR THE INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE CITIZENS DURING WORLD WAR. TWO AND THE CLINTON'S ADMINISTRATION'S NINETEEN NINETY SOME APOLOGY FOR THAT TUSKEGEE EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED. IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES THROUGH THE SEVENTIES. NOW WHILE THESE APOLOGIES I CAME DECADES AFTER VIOLATIONS TAKING PLACE THERE'S NO REASON FOR US TO HAVE TO WAIT. WHY SHOULD WE WAIT TO APOLOGIZE TO CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN FORCIBLY REMOVED FROM THEIR FAMILIES? WE NOTE WE MADE A MISTAKE AND THIS IS WRONG. SO WHAT THAT YOU ARE TWENTY NINE WE ASK CONGRESS APOLOGIZE NOW FOR THE HARMS THOSE PRET BOTH PRESENT AN ON GOING BECAUSE BY.
