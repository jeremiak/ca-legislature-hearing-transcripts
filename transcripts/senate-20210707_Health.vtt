FOR REFERRING TO SPECIALISTS

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:35.999
WHEN NEEDED. THAT WOULD NEGATE

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:37.334
THE WHOLE IMPETUS FOR THE BELL

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:39.536
N. AS A LICENSED ADDICTION. I'M

USE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AS

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:49.011
PRIMARY CARE. BECAUSE THEY DO

POLICY ADOPTED. MMHM THE BOTTOM

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.376
LINE IS THAT WE ARE REALLY GOOD

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:03.345
AT TESTING PEOPLE IN A LOT OF

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:05.013
DIFFERENT MEDICAL FACILITIES.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.748
WHERE WE'RE NOT GOOD ABOUT

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.250
DOING THAT IS IN EMERGENCY

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:10.652
DEPARTMENTS- SOME HOSPITALS ARE

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:12.187
BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT MANY ARE

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.856
NOT DOING ROUTINE HIV TESTING.

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:16.158
AND WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:17.959
IS TO REQUIRE THAT AT LEAST A

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:20.629
MANDATE TO OFFER- IS- IS

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:22.798

NEW CASES OF HIV EVERY YEAR.

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:32.574
THAT IS CAUSED IN GREAT PART BY

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:34.409
THE 15% OF THE PEOPLE WITH HIV

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:35.777
WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:38.613

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.287
AND THEY'RE CAUSING FORTY

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:47.622
PERCENT. OF THE NEW INFECTIONS.

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:48.957

EDUCATE THEM- MAKE SURE THEY'RE

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.928
AWARE OF THEIR HIV STATUS. SO

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:54.629
THEY'RE NOT UNINTENTIONALLY-

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:56.631

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:12.026
IN RESPONSE TO WHAT THE

01:27:12.093 --> 01:27:13.461

THINKING THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:20.935

WANNA THANK YOU FOR WORKING

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:26.407
WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THE BILL-

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:27.675
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- WE WANT

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:28.943
TO BE SURE WE ADDRESS. THAT THE

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.745
OPPOSITION RACE WAS ABOUT-

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:33.181
PAYMENT ACTUALLY AND- AND

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:34.415
SUPPORTING THIS AND I WILL MAKE

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:36.718
NOTE THAT- NOT ONLY OF COURSE

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:38.019
HE TOOK THE AMENDMENT ON US

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:39.354
PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.989
WE ALSO LOOKED UP AND- FOUND

01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:42.957
OUT THAT. IT IS ACTUALLY RATED.

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:44.392
AS A PREVENTIVE SERVICE IT WAS

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:46.060
RAISING EIGHT WHICH MEANS THAT

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:47.462
IT ACTUALLY IS COVERED WITHOUT

01:27:47.528 --> 01:27:49.230
CO PAY FIVE. HUNDRED AFFORDABLE

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:51.265
CARE ACT. AND WE EVEN CHECKED

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:52.400
TO BE SURE THAT MERGES TWO

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:53.701
ROOMS WOULD STILL COULD AVAIL

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:55.103
THEMSELVES OF THAT PROVISION

01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:57.171
SO. THEREFORE IF YOU ARE HAVE

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:59.807
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE- YOU ARE

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:00.875
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THAT

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:03.211
WITHOUT COST SHARING- IT'S ALSO

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:05.613
COVERED BY MEDI CAL AS WELL- SO

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.614
I CERTAINLY DO MAKE NOTE THAT

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:08.716
IF SOMEONE'S. TOTALLY UNINSURED

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:10.685
THAT COULD BE A GAP BUT-

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:12.787
FRANKLY BETWEEN THE INSURED IT

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:13.688
WHETHER YOU HAVE MEDIC HOW ARE

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:14.722
INSURED THAT WILL BE COVERED

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:18.126
WITHOUT COST SHARE- I DO FIND

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:19.494
OUT WHAT WE DID HAVE JUST A

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.995
PRESENTATION ALSO ON STREET

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:22.263
MEDICINE AND WE TALKED ABOUT

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:23.431
HOW WE HAVE TO. REACH PEOPLE

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:25.566
WHERE THEY ARE AND SO I DO FIND

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:26.501
A LITTLE CHALLENGING TO SAY

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:27.568
THAT THE ANSWER WOULD ACTUALLY

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:29.771
BE IS THAT ONCE YOU HIT SOMEONE

01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:30.805
SHOWS UP EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WE

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:32.707
THEN. SAY IF YOU WANT TO TEST

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:34.108
WE HAVE SEND YOU SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:35.109
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:36.244
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO TRY TO

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.911
CLOSE THAT GAP BUT ALSO

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.613
APPRECIATE THAT YOU. TOOK AN

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.781
AMENDMENT THAT SAID IF THE E.

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:41.549
OURS AWARE AND IN THEIR OWN

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:42.750
RECORD AND BY LIKE THE WHOLE

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.152
ENTIRE HOSPITAL RECORD YOU KNOW

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:45.853
WHATEVER THE R. HAS ACCESS TO.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:46.888
THAT PERSON'S EITHER GOTTEN THE

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:48.356
TESTER READY IN THE LAST TWELVE

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.323
MONTHS OR ACTUALLY THE

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:51.626
REPOSITORY KNOW. THEN ACTUALLY

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:52.794
THEY DON'T NEED TO DO THAT IT'S

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.362
UP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:55.096
OTHERWISE TAKE TIME TO CHECK

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.764
THAT OUT BUT- AGAIN THAT WOULD

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:58.633
REDUCE THAT TIME BURDEN AS WELL

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.034
AS WE ARE HOPEFULLY.

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:02.270
IDENTIFYING PEOPLE. WHO HAVE

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:03.838
HIV GETTING THEM TO CARE I

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:05.106
THINK THAT'S THE PART WE NEED

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.507
TO BE SURE WE CONTINUE TO WORK

01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:07.842
ON GETTING THE CARE SO

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:09.610
HOPEFULLY WE CAN AGAIN. I HAVE

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:12.013
THIS. REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THIS

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.848
CONTAGIOUS DISEASE AND THAT'S I

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.216
THINK THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.984
ACTUALLY IDENTIFY SO WE CAN

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:22.356
LIMIT THE SPREAD. AND

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:22.890
EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY EVEN

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:23.691
ELIMINATE- IT H. IDEAS WELL. SO

01:29:23.758 --> 01:29:24.559
I AM. APPRECIATE THE- THEY WERE

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:25.226
BROUGHT UP BY A PHONE. OF PEACE.

01:29:25.293 --> 01:29:27.228
THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW- BUT

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:28.396
WORKING WITH THEM THAT WE'RE

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:29.464
TRYING TO FIND OUT THE PATH

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.632
FORWARD TO- SHOULD RETIRE AND

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.501
THEN A FIGHT. AND THEN GET.

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:35.336
PEOPLE ACCESS TO THE CARE THEY

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:38.706
NEED- IF THEY ARE HIV POSITIVE-

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:39.774
AND ALSO TRYING NOT TO

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:41.242
OVERBURDEN EMERGENCY ROOM SO I

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:43.611
APPRECIATE THAT WORK. I WOULD

01:29:43.678 --> 01:29:45.780
LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU DR PAN

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:48.916
I. JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO MENTION

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:49.550
A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:55.323
I. HE WAS A- I WAS A STAFFER

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:56.290
WITH A LOT MORE HERE AT THAT

01:29:56.357 --> 01:29:59.127
TIME HERE WHERE I WORKED ON A.

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:01.295
B. E. THIRTY FIVE FOR MY FORMER

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:03.397
FOR MY FORMER BOSS- SOME LIMIT

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:04.265
AND THEN SOME REMEMBER PAUL

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:06.801
KRIKORIAN- AND WE DO AGREE THAT

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:08.736
INSURERS NEED TO FULFILL THEIR

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:11.272
PAYMENT OBLIGATION AND WILL

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:12.974
WORK WITH CAL A STEP. TO

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.342
RESOLVE THAT ISSUE BUT WOULD HE

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:15.810
BE WITH EIGHT THIRTY FIVE DATE

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:18.913
WAS OBLIGATED INSURERS TO PAY

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.082
FOR HIV TEST SO THERE'S ALSO

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:21.682
THAT PIECE AS WELL BUT I JUST

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:25.019
WANTED TO MENTION- SECOND-

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:27.488
AGAIN IT HAVING WORKED ON THIS

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:29.257
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN RUN

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:30.558
A BUILD THAT CAME UP WITH THE

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:32.260
STUDY WHICH DISCOVERED THAT ONE

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:35.329
POINT 7% OF UNSUSPECTING

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:40.001
INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGES OF

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:40.535
FIFTEEN FOURTEEN TO THIRTY

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:42.837
FIVE. WHO WENT TO THE ER ROOMS

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:44.605
WERE CAPTURED AS INDIVIDUALS

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:46.140
WHO DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WERE

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:48.009
HIV POSITIVE I MEAN THAT'S A

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.710
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER AND

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.412
THAT'S WHY WE FELT IT WAS

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:53.314
IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD NOW

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:55.917
WITH WITH REQUIRING THIS ON AN

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:57.819
ONGOING BASIS IT'S REQUIRED.

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:59.854
BUT IT GIVES THE OPTION FOR THE

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:01.856
INDIVIDUAL TO OPT OUT THAT'S

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:03.758
REQUIRED FOR THE HOSPITAL TO

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:05.927
PASS THE E. OUR ROOM TO ASK-

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:07.695
AND LOGISTICALLY WE TRY TO DO

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.397
EVERYTHING WE COULD WORK HAVING

01:31:09.463 --> 01:31:11.299
WORKED WITH THE ER DOCTORS

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:13.768
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:14.368

01:31:14.435 --> 01:31:17.872
FIRST BILL- EVERY IT AT EVERY

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:19.440
ITERATION WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.576
IT EASIER FOR THEM. BECAUSE WE

01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:23.711
DO UNDERSTAND THE STRENUOUS

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:25.947
CONDITIONS OF IN YOUR ROOM SO

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:27.348
THE JUST SPEAKING TO THE

01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:28.749
LOGISTICS IF I'M UNDERSTANDING

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:30.418
IT CORRECTLY WE WANTED THAT'S

01:31:30.484 --> 01:31:31.919
WHY E INSERTED LANGUAGE THAT

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:35.489
WOULD ALLOW- FOR THE POSITIVE

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:37.959
RESULT TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:39.694
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND FOR

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.996

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:46.300
COUNSELING SO WE'VE TRIED TO

01:31:46.367 --> 01:31:49.604
TAKE EVERY. DIFFERENT APPROACH

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:54.942
IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:55.543
E. R. THE STRESS ON THE E. R.

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:56.244
ROOM IS REALLY BUT THAT'S THE

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:57.945
LAST. THATWE CAN ACTUALLY

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:01.082
CAPTURE. ANY OUTLINE

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:02.683
INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE

NOT BE TESTED THAT THAT WOULD

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:09.056
BE THE BEST PLACE. SO- PROBABLY

01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:11.993
ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON THIS.

THIS BILL FROM A PARENT'S

02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:01.219

02:26:07.825 --> 02:26:08.960
EIGHT PUT MUCH OF THIS ALREADY

INTO STATUTE. BUT AS A PARENT-

02:26:15.032 --> 02:26:15.967
EIGHT I AM I'M TRYING TO

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:17.301
UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S A GOOD

02:26:17.368 --> 02:26:19.170
THING THAT A CHILD WHO'S GOING

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:20.705
THROUGH SOMETHING THAT COULD BE

02:26:20.771 --> 02:26:22.273
LIFE CHANGING OR SOMETHING

02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:26.110
THAT'S- REALLY AND- AN

02:26:26.177 --> 02:26:27.778
EMOTIONAL DIFFICULTY THAT THIRD

02:26:27.845 --> 02:26:31.149
STRUGGLING WITH HOW. IT'S OKAY

02:26:31.215 --> 02:26:32.316
TO KEEP THE PARENTS FROM

02:26:32.383 --> 02:26:34.085
KNOWING THAT IN AN EFFORT TO

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:35.153
YOU KNOW FOR THOSE PARENTS OR

02:26:35.219 --> 02:26:37.922
OTHER CAREGIVERS- TO HELP THEM

02:26:37.989 --> 02:26:40.424
THROUGH THAT AND- YOUR CHILDREN

02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:43.327
YOUR YOUR YOUR SON HE'S LITTLE-

02:26:43.394 --> 02:26:45.062
SO YOU HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED YET

02:26:45.129 --> 02:26:47.598
THE- THE EMOTIONAL ROLLER

02:26:47.665 --> 02:26:50.568
COASTER KNOWN AS- TEENAGERS.

02:26:50.635 --> 02:26:52.837
BUT I WILL TELL YOU IT'S- IT

02:26:52.904 --> 02:26:55.339
CAN BE A STRUGGLE IN TEENAGERS

02:26:55.406 --> 02:26:57.041
AND EVEN YOU KNOW PRETEENS

02:26:57.108 --> 02:27:00.011
TYPICALLY. YOU KNOW THEY DON'T

02:27:00.077 --> 02:27:00.578
LIKE TO TALK TO YOUR PARENTS

02:27:00.645 --> 02:27:02.246
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. WE

02:27:02.313 --> 02:27:03.514
DIDN'T I'M SURE THEIR RATINGS

02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:04.615
WOULD PREFER TO TALK TO OUR

02:27:04.682 --> 02:27:06.250
FRIENDS ABOUT OR SOMEONE ELSE

02:27:06.317 --> 02:27:07.084
BUT NOT CERTAINLY NOT HER

02:27:07.151 --> 02:27:09.287
PARENTS. THE SAME GOES HOLDS

02:27:09.353 --> 02:27:11.556
TRUE FOR TODAY HOWEVER THAT

02:27:11.622 --> 02:27:13.691
DOESN'T NEGATE THE FACT THAT

02:27:13.758 --> 02:27:15.459
CHILDREN REALLY DO NEED THEIR

02:27:15.526 --> 02:27:17.628
PARENTS INPUT AND GUIDANCE AND

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:18.529
COUNSEL ON SOME OF THESE

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:20.932
ISSUES. AND BY PASSING

02:27:20.998 --> 02:27:22.667
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS THIS

02:27:22.733 --> 02:27:23.768
MEANS THAT THE PARENT HAS NO

02:27:23.834 --> 02:27:27.004
HOPE OF EVEN BEING ABLE TO

02:27:27.071 --> 02:27:33.678
ADDRESS IT- AND- I THINK ABOUT.

02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:35.680
BUT CHECK MY CHILD A MINOR WHO

02:27:35.746 --> 02:27:38.616
IS ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:41.352
SERVICES NOW. IF A PARENT

02:27:41.419 --> 02:27:42.453
DOESN'T KNOW THAT THIS IS

02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:44.789
TAKING PLACE AND A PARENT

02:27:44.855 --> 02:27:46.691
DOESN'T KNOW THAT THIS. MINOR

02:27:46.757 --> 02:27:50.895
IS. SEEKING THESE MENTAL HEALTH

02:27:50.962 --> 02:27:52.330
SERVICES PERHAPS BEING GIVEN

02:27:52.396 --> 02:27:55.499
MEDICATION TO TREAT IT HOW IN

02:27:55.566 --> 02:27:57.068
THE WORLD IS APPARENT ABLE TO

02:27:57.134 --> 02:27:59.070
RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS THAT

02:27:59.136 --> 02:28:00.271
SOMETHING MAY BE GOING TERRIBLY

02:28:00.338 --> 02:28:01.906
WRONG CAN BE ABLE TO REACH OUT

02:28:01.973 --> 02:28:05.176
AND HELP THEM. IMAGINE THE-

02:28:05.243 --> 02:28:06.744
LIKE THE GUILT THAT WOULD

02:28:06.811 --> 02:28:09.914
OVERWHELM THE PARENT IF. YOU

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:10.514
KNOW SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN

02:28:10.581 --> 02:28:12.450
TO THEIR CHILD AND- THEY WERE

02:28:12.516 --> 02:28:13.684
IGNORANT OF WHAT WAS TAKING

02:28:13.751 --> 02:28:15.286
PLACE THAT SAID THAT'S TERRIBLE

02:28:15.353 --> 02:28:18.522
BURDEN. TO PLACE ON A PARENT

02:28:18.589 --> 02:28:20.958
WHO- LIKELY LOVES THEIR CHILD

02:28:21.025 --> 02:28:21.726
MAYBE THEY'RE HAVING SOME

02:28:21.792 --> 02:28:23.728
DIFFICULTY IN SOME DIFFERENCES

02:28:23.794 --> 02:28:26.697
BUT STILL LOVES THEIR CHILD- SO

02:28:26.764 --> 02:28:28.933
FOR THAT REASON I AM NOT ABLE

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:30.201
TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:32.103
I WONDER IF. PERHAPS YOU COULD

02:28:32.169 --> 02:28:33.771
COMMENT ON SOME OF THOSE

02:28:33.838 --> 02:28:34.905
CONCERNS IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:36.741
THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY I WOULD BE

02:28:36.807 --> 02:28:37.908
HAPPY TO LET ME JUST START BY

02:28:37.975 --> 02:28:41.846
SAYING. AS APPARENTLY Q. ALL OF

02:28:41.912 --> 02:28:43.314
US CARE VERY DEEPLY FOR OUR

02:28:43.381 --> 02:28:45.216
CHILDREN WANT TO WANT TO ENSURE

02:28:45.283 --> 02:28:47.952
THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE BEST

02:28:48.019 --> 02:28:50.254
CARE POSSIBLE- WHAT I. WILL SAY

02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:52.890
A FEW THINGS- I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:28:52.957 --> 02:28:55.426
FOR. MANY OPPONENTS OF THIS

02:28:55.493 --> 02:28:57.161
BILL WE ALL MAY HAVE A BIT OF A

02:28:57.228 --> 02:28:58.663
PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE OF

02:28:58.729 --> 02:29:00.197
OPINION ON A PATIENT'S RIGHT TO

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.132
PRIVACY AND THE RIGHT TO

02:29:01.198 --> 02:29:02.500
CHOOSE. BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE

02:29:02.566 --> 02:29:04.035
IT VERY CLEAR WHAT THIS BILL

02:29:04.101 --> 02:29:05.202
DOES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT

02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:06.737
BECAUSE I THINK- THE

02:29:06.804 --> 02:29:08.939
OPPOSITION'S. ARGUMENTS ARE BIT

02:29:09.006 --> 02:29:11.342
MISPLACED. WITH REGARD TO WHAT

02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:12.977
IS CURRENT LAWSUIT THE

02:29:13.044 --> 02:29:14.045
OPPOSITION HAS BEEN ASSERTING

02:29:14.111 --> 02:29:15.379
THAT SOMEHOW THIS BILL WILL

02:29:15.446 --> 02:29:16.580
ALLOW CHILDREN TO ACCESS

02:29:16.647 --> 02:29:18.416
MEDICAL CARE IN SECRET. FROM

02:29:18.482 --> 02:29:19.483
THEIR PARENTS AND THAT

02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:21.452
STATEMENT IS JUST FRANKLY NOT

02:29:21.519 --> 02:29:24.522
TRUE- THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE

02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:25.423
ANYTHING ABOUT EXISTING

02:29:25.489 --> 02:29:27.858
MEDICAL. CONSENT LAW IT DOESN'T

02:29:27.925 --> 02:29:29.360
CHANGE WHAT SERVICES A MINOR

02:29:29.427 --> 02:29:31.896
CAN CONSENT TO WITHOUT PARENTAL

02:29:31.962 --> 02:29:33.597
SIGN OFF- SO THERE ARE MANY

02:29:33.664 --> 02:29:35.766
LAWS STATE AND FEDERAL. ON

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:37.301
MINOR CONSENT TO GIVE MINERS

02:29:37.368 --> 02:29:38.669
THE RIGHT TO ACCESS SERVICES

02:29:38.736 --> 02:29:40.438
LIKE PREGNANCY AND ABORTION

02:29:40.504 --> 02:29:42.540
CARE. MENTAL HEALTH CARE STD

02:29:42.606 --> 02:29:44.475
SERVICES WITHOUT PARENTAL

02:29:44.542 --> 02:29:45.943
CONSENT AND SO I APPRECIATE

02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:47.311
THAT- I THINK A LOT OF

02:29:47.378 --> 02:29:49.213
OPPOSITION. MAY WISH THAT THOSE

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:51.349
LAWS WERE DIFFERENT. BUT THIS

02:29:51.415 --> 02:29:53.918
BILL DOESN'T IMPACT THAT SO

02:29:53.984 --> 02:29:54.985
JUST WANNA MAKE THAT CLEAR WHAT

02:29:55.052 --> 02:29:56.954
THIS BILL DOES SAY THOUGH IS IF

02:29:57.021 --> 02:29:58.389
A PARENT CAN CAN IF IT IF THE

02:29:58.456 --> 02:30:01.859
PATIENT WAS A YOUNG PERSON. BUT

02:30:01.926 --> 02:30:04.095
CAN CONSENT TO A SENSE OF

02:30:04.161 --> 02:30:05.763
SERVICE WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS.

02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:06.764
THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:30:06.831 --> 02:30:08.132
RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS ON THE

02:30:08.199 --> 02:30:10.101
CARE THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL SO

02:30:10.167 --> 02:30:11.836
THAT'S WHAT THIS WHAT THIS BILL

02:30:11.902 --> 02:30:13.070
DOES SPIKE AGAIN I APPRECIATE

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:14.472
THAT WE MAY HAVE A DIFFERENCE

02:30:14.538 --> 02:30:16.540
OF OPINION ON. THE AGE OF

02:30:16.607 --> 02:30:18.209
MEDICAL CONSENT AND WHEN THAT

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:19.443
COULD HAPPEN BUT THAT'S A

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:21.145
DIFFERENT BILL FOR DIFFERENT.

02:30:21.212 --> 02:30:23.080
CONVERSATIONS AND I APPRECIATE

02:30:23.147 --> 02:30:24.482
THAT IN YOUR RATE I THINK MANY

02:30:24.548 --> 02:30:25.883
OF US WOULD PREFERRED THAT

02:30:25.950 --> 02:30:27.685
THOSE LAWS WERE IN PLACE THAT

02:30:27.752 --> 02:30:29.553
WE COULD YOU KNOW BE THERE FOR

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:31.188
KIDS WHEN THEY MAY NEED US EVEN

02:30:31.255 --> 02:30:33.758
THOUGH THEY MAY NOT. BE OPEN TO

02:30:33.824 --> 02:30:35.459
DISCUSSING THE ISSUE BUT I

02:30:35.526 --> 02:30:37.194
THINK. ALSO THE HEART OF THE

02:30:37.261 --> 02:30:38.829
BILL IS THAT IT REALLY IS

02:30:38.896 --> 02:30:41.999
CEILING. THIS WHOLE EVOLUTION

02:30:42.066 --> 02:30:44.201
INVOLVED SO THAT A PARENT HAS

02:30:44.268 --> 02:30:46.036
ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF KNOWING

02:30:46.103 --> 02:30:49.673
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THEIR

02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:50.307
CHILD WHILE IT'S TRUE. THAT YOU

02:30:50.374 --> 02:30:50.941
YOU KNOW EXIST LINE WILL ALLOW

02:30:51.008 --> 02:30:52.276
THEM TO. THIS CARE WITHOUT

02:30:52.343 --> 02:30:53.611
THEIR PARENTS KNOWLEDGE THIS

02:30:53.677 --> 02:30:56.046
BILL. GOES FURTHER TO MAKE SURE

02:30:56.113 --> 02:30:58.783
THAT ANY- BILLING INFORMATION

02:30:58.849 --> 02:31:00.684
IS ALSO KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AND

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:02.820
IS NOT SENT TO THE PARENT. WHO

02:31:02.887 --> 02:31:04.989
IS THE POLICY HOLDER WHO IS YOU

02:31:05.055 --> 02:31:06.557
KNOW PAYING FOR THAT INSURANCE

02:31:06.624 --> 02:31:09.427
POLICY SO IT REALLY DOES. LOCK

02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:11.862
IT AWAY SO THAT A PARENT. JUST

02:31:11.929 --> 02:31:13.097
HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:15.032
THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S THE CORE

02:31:15.099 --> 02:31:16.934
ISSUE BUT I APPRECIATE YOU.

02:31:17.001 --> 02:31:18.369

02:31:29.146 --> 02:31:31.081
ALSO THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION

02:31:31.148 --> 02:31:32.416
IS CONFUSED ON WHAT THIS BILL

02:31:32.483 --> 02:31:34.852
DOES AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY

02:31:34.919 --> 02:31:36.620
MAY WANT TO CHANGE CURRENT AND

02:31:36.687 --> 02:31:38.222
EXISTING LAW BUT I WOULD ALSO

02:31:38.289 --> 02:31:39.657
SAY THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO

02:31:39.723 --> 02:31:40.891
CALLED IT IN OPPOSITION ARE

02:31:40.958 --> 02:31:42.026
PROBABLY THE ONES WHO NEED THIS

02:31:42.092 --> 02:31:44.361

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:45.362
THESE PARENTS ARE NOT PARENTS

HOUSE WHEN THEY SAID THAT THEY

02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:08.452

MAKING SURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE

02:32:14.158 --> 02:32:15.559
ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE THAT

02:32:15.626 --> 02:32:17.428
THEY NEED I WISH WE LIVED IN A

02:32:17.495 --> 02:32:18.662
WORLD WHERE EVERY FAMILY

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:20.264
ACCEPTED THEIR CHILD THE WAY

AS A SURVIVOR MYSELF. AN

02:33:11.315 --> 02:33:12.516
ADVOCATE FOR VICTIMS I DO

02:33:12.583 --> 02:33:14.184
UNDERSTAND JUST HOW IMPORTANT

02:33:14.251 --> 02:33:15.319
IT IS TO KEEP SOME OF THE

02:33:15.386 --> 02:33:18.556

02:33:18.622 --> 02:33:21.358

RETALIATION I THINK IT'S

02:33:41.612 --> 02:33:43.948

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:44.354
FOR. THE INCREASE CAN- IN

02:37:44.421 --> 02:37:45.255
MESSED VIOLENCE SO WE TO REGRET.

02:37:45.322 --> 02:37:46.423
THE WE NEED TO GIVE THOSE

02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:48.458
TOOLS- TO PATIENTS SO THEY HAVE

02:37:48.525 --> 02:37:50.527
THOSE TOOLS. BUT ALSO IN TERMS

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:52.930
OF- CHILDREN YOU KNOW- WHEN I

02:37:52.996 --> 02:37:54.364
SEE A CHILD NAME WANTS TO

02:37:54.431 --> 02:37:56.266
DISCLOSE SOMETHING TO ME- AS IN

02:37:56.333 --> 02:37:59.736
A VISIT. IN PRIVACY I DO ALWAYS

02:37:59.803 --> 02:38:00.504
ENCOURAGE THEM TO DISCUSS IT

02:38:00.571 --> 02:38:02.339
WITH THEIR PARENTS. ALL RIGHT.

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:03.407
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO

02:38:03.473 --> 02:38:05.075
HAVE HAPPEN THAT'S IDEAL. BUT

02:38:05.142 --> 02:38:07.411
THE SAME TIME- WE ALSO KNOW

02:38:07.477 --> 02:38:09.646
THAT IF THEY KNEW THERE WASN'T

02:38:09.713 --> 02:38:11.014
THE PRIVACY AND THAT AND NOT

02:38:11.081 --> 02:38:12.149
SAY ONLY DID IT WITH THEIR

02:38:12.216 --> 02:38:13.217
PERMISSION THEY WOULD DISCLOSE

02:38:13.283 --> 02:38:14.718
IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND WHAT DO

02:38:14.785 --> 02:38:17.421
KNOW IS THAT. CHILDREN IF THEY

02:38:17.487 --> 02:38:18.655
CAN GET ADULT GUIDANCE ARE

02:38:18.722 --> 02:38:20.624
GONNA MAKE BETTER DECISIONS. SO

02:38:20.691 --> 02:38:23.527
THE ISSUE THEN BECOMES. WELL IF

02:38:23.594 --> 02:38:24.728
THEY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

02:38:24.795 --> 02:38:25.963
ENOUGH AND I KNOW IT'S

02:38:26.029 --> 02:38:27.231
SOMETHING THAT CAN YOU KNOW THE

02:38:27.297 --> 02:38:28.365
PARENTS YOU ALWAYS WANT YOUR

02:38:28.432 --> 02:38:29.466
CHILD TO COME TO TELL YOU

02:38:29.533 --> 02:38:30.534
EVERYTHING BUT LET'S FACE IT

02:38:30.601 --> 02:38:32.236
THAT'S NOT REALITY ALL THE TIME

02:38:32.302 --> 02:38:33.370
RIGHT FOR WHATEVER. REASONS

02:38:33.437 --> 02:38:34.805
DYNAMICS MARISSA NET DOESN'T

02:38:34.872 --> 02:38:36.473
HAVE TO DO WITH. A JUDGMENT ON

02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:38.175
TERMS OF. WHAT THE OTHER

02:38:38.242 --> 02:38:40.244
PARENTS CARE FOR THAT CHILD.

02:38:40.310 --> 02:38:41.078
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEENAGERS

02:38:41.144 --> 02:38:43.313
RATE AND- AND ADOLESCENTS ARE

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:44.081
GOING UP TRYING TO BECOME

02:38:44.147 --> 02:38:45.649
INDEPENDENT AND SOMETIMES THEY

02:38:45.716 --> 02:38:46.583
JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:48.652
TELLING US AS PARENTS. BUT WE

02:38:48.719 --> 02:38:50.554
BASICALLY CLOSE OFF ALL AVENUES

02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:51.488
FOR THEM TODAY AND TALK TO

02:38:51.555 --> 02:38:52.656
ANOTHER ADULT WHERE DATA

02:38:52.723 --> 02:38:54.258
PRIVACY CAN BE MAINTAINED.

02:38:54.324 --> 02:38:56.526
INCLUDING PHYSICIANS OR HEALTH

02:38:56.593 --> 02:38:58.028
OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS.

02:38:58.095 --> 02:38:59.863
THAT ACTUALLY CAN LEAD TO POOR

02:38:59.930 --> 02:39:02.099
DECISIONS BEING MADE AND ALSO-

02:39:02.165 --> 02:39:03.834
ENDANGERED THEIR HEALTH AND

02:39:03.901 --> 02:39:06.069
SAFETY AS WELL. AND SO I THINK

02:39:06.136 --> 02:39:09.172
pLAWS. THAT BY THE WAY IS AS

02:39:09.239 --> 02:39:10.941

THROUGH THE HEALTH PLAN THAT

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:24.821
BASICALLY UNDERMINES THOSE

02:39:24.888 --> 02:39:26.623
PARTICULAR PRIVACY LAWS. AND
