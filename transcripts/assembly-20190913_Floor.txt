BECAUSE THIS WILL DO REAL HARM TO THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT SAID NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT THE TIME AT THIS HOUR TO BE PASSING LEGISLATION TO MAKE HERE POLITICAL STATEMENTS WATER IS CRITICAL TO THE ECONOMIC HEALTH OF OUR ENTIRE STATE. THIS LEGISLATION THREATENS THE WATER RELIABILITY OF OUR ENTIRE STATE THIS BILL SPLIT WOULD COST THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND WATER USERS IN EXCESS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER. THAT IS TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR BILLION GALLONS THAT COULD BE GOING TO SUPPORT OUR ECONOMY TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY INTO SUPPORT EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS THAT IS ENOUGH WATER. TO SUPPORT SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL THREATENS ALL THAT. THIS BILL WOULD SET OUR STATE BACK WATER WISE TENNEY BACK TEN YEARS. THERE IS BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. NOT ONLY FROM REPUBLICANS BUT FROM DEMOCRATS THAT REPRESENT FROM DIANNE FEINSTEIN. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CONGRESS MEMBERS IN THE CENTER VALLEY. WE SHOULD TAKE THE TIME TO MAKE SURE IT THIS POLICY IS DONE RIGHT IF YOU THIS BILL NEED TO MOVE FORWARD THERE AMENDMENTS WE'VE DRAFTED. THAT WOULD BE A WHAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE CONCERNS OF US IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND IT WOULD FIX THIS PROBLEM. THAT WOULD PRESERVE THE WATER RELIABILITY OF THE ENTIRE STATE BUT RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME BECAUSE THIS BILL IS BEING JAMMED UPON US. FOR SOME POLITICAL STATEMENT. THIS IS A NOT RESPONSIBLE THIS IS NOT THE WAY WATER POLICY SHOULD BE MADE IN OUR STATE WE SHOULD BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER AND FIND SOME FORM OF COMMON SENSE BUT IF THIS BILL CONTINUES YOU'RE JEOPARDIZING THE WATER STABILITY OF THE ENTIRE STATE AND THE ECONOMIC HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OF ALL OF US I URGE NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISS FARMERS FLOOR YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I'M A KEEP MY REMARKS VERY VERY SHORT BUT- THIS BILL ACTUALLY BREAKS MY HEART. THIS BILL IS A BILL THERE'S A PARTICULAR SECTION IS BILL TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN THAT HAS BEEN. A HUGE BATTLE WITHIN OUR AREA. FOR LAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE BEEN HOLDING MEETINGS WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS WORKING WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. TO TRY TO COME UP WITH AN AGREEMENT. THIS BILL TAKES IT ALL AWAY. COLLEAGUES I JUST IMPLORE YOU. TO TAKE A MOMENT. WITH RESPECT OF THE AUTHOR BUT TAKE A MOMENT TO PAUSE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. THIS IS OUR LIVELIHOODS. THIS IS OUR WATER WE CAN GET THIS RIGHT. WE JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN OVER. AMOS PHARMACY PATTERSON YOUR RECOGNIZE. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. TO DIRECTLY QUOTE THE VOICES OF THE OPPOSITION. QUOTE SB ONE GENERATE THAT WILL WILL GENERATE YEARS OF LITIGATION. QUOTE IN THE MIDST OF SUCH FUNDAMENTAL UNCERTAINTY WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO THE UP TO DEVELOP ANY VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT OF SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVER OUTFLOW STANDARDS. SB ONE QUOTE WOULD PREVENT AND FREEZE IN PLACE STATE AND FEDERAL BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS DEVELOPED OVER TEN YEARS REGARDLESS. OF WHETHER THERE IS MORE SCIENCE END OF QUOTE. SB ONE QUOTE COULD UNDERMINE THE PROGRESS BEING MADE ON VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. WHAT THIS BILL HURTS THE INCENTIVE TO CONTINUE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS AND WILL END UP COSTING OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY DEARLY. SB ONE WOULD CODIFY IN STATE LAW THE OUT DATED TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND NINE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WHICH SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH A NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINION THAT UTILIZES. THE LATEST DATA METHODS AND QUOTE. FURTHERMORE BLOWING UP THIS PROCESS BY. ENACTING THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROVISION OF SENATE BILL ONE WOULD RESULT IN THE MAJOR PARTIES WALKING AWAY FROM THE GOVERNOR'S COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. INSTEAD OF WORKING TOGETHER AND QUOTE. QUOTE THIS COULD RESULT IN LITIGATION THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION LITIGATION IN THE WATER WORLD DOES NOT RESOLVE CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM WATER PROBLEMS END OF QUOTE. SB ONE QUOTE IN ITS PRESENT FORM IS A STEP BACKWARDS QUOTE IT IS JUST NOT PROPER AND GOOD. FOR ANYBODY TO LOCK IN OUTDATED SCIENTIFIC MODELS END QUOTE. QUOTE SP ONE IS FLAWED AS THE BILL REJECTS NEW SCIENCE THAT WOULD CHANGE HOW WATER SUPPLIES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR MANAGED. VOTE I WANT TO ROLL BACK THE SCIENCE TO RELY ON ONE OUTDATED VERSION THE CALLS FOR GREATLY INCREASED SERVICE WATER BEING DIVERTED FROM THE DELTA AND QUOTE. QUOTE I WILL STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNOR TO VETO. MEMBERS THESE ARE NOT TO THE TALKING POINTS OF THE REPUBLICANS. THESE ARE THE VOTE THE VOICES OF THOSE FEDERAL LEGISLATORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED. BY THE VOTERS INCLUDING SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN. OTHER KEY CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS LIKE JOHN GARAMENDI JIM COSTA TJ NOT ALLOW. YOUR HATRED FOR THIS PRESIDENT. MOVE YOU TOWARD A DECISION. THAT YOUR OWN DEMOCRAT FEDERAL LEGISLATORS OPPOSE. YOU ARE TAKING AN ANTI TRUMP STEP WAY TOO FAR. AND THESE WERE THE. QUOTED SENTIMENTS OF YOUR DEMOCRATIC. ELECTED. MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND U. S. SENATE. LISTEN TO THEIR VOICE PLEASE IF YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO MINE THANK YOU. MR RIGHT YOUR RECKLESS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION. HOPEFULLY TO. SHOW TO SELL ME ON THIS FOR THAT THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN ISSUE. IT CERTAINLY IS A BILL THAT HAS A PARTISAN EDGE TO IT. AND FRANKLY THOSE ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL THAT I SUPPORT. BUT SOME OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES FROM THE VALLEY OF STOOD UP IN OPPOSITION TO THIS. AS IT RELATES TO WATER. AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO COMMUNITIES THE LARGELY. EMPLOYED BY AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS. SMALL FARMERS BIG FARMERS GROWING COMMUNITIES LIKE MY HOME TOWN MERCED NOT HOME OF UC MERCED THAT DEPENDS ON WATER IS THE VERY LIFEBLOOD OF OUR ECONOMY. AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY IN THIS BILL BECAUSE WERE LIVING IN A TIME OF HARDEN PARTISANSHIP WHERE SIDES ARE TOO FAR APART IS WAS GOING TO DESTROY. THE PROGRESS THAT I'VE WORKED FOR SEVEN YEARS IN THIS OFFICE. THROUGH TWO ADMINISTRATIONS TO ACHIEVE. WHILE WE HAVE THOSE ON THE LEFT. TO TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO CRITICIZE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT. AND THE POLITICS MAY BE GOOD FOR THEM. WEEK WE HAVE THOSE ON THE RIGHT. FOR MANY YEARS WERE TOO STUBBORN TO COME TOTHE TABLE. ON AGREEMENTS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH PEOPLE ON THE LEFT THAT THEY DIDN'T SEE THE WORLD'S AND THEY COULDN'T SEE IT THROUGH THEIR LIVES. THEY SAW SOMEONE TRYING TO TAKE THEIR LIVELIHOOD. FOLKS ON THE OTHER SIDE LOOKING TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT PROTECT OUR NATURAL HABITAT THE- BEAUTIFUL RIVERS THAT RUN THROUGH MY DISTRICT. THROUGH BY CALLING FOR REFERENCE DISTRICT AND THE REST OF THE DELEGATION SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THROUGH TWO ADMINISTRATIONS AND THROUGH SEVEN YEARS OF DISCUSSION WE'VE ACTUALLY. GOTTEN PEOPLE WHO SEE THE WORLD VERY DIFFERENTLY TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH THE JOB. AND WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN THIS NEW GOVERNOR HAS REITERATED A COMMITMENT TO THAT PROGRESS. AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE HAVE IN PART OF THIS BILL TODAY. WILL DESTROY THAT WILL SHOW BAD FAITH WILL CAUSE PEOPLE TO WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE AND- THINGS WILL GO ON. WATER. IN SOME CASES WILL CONTINUE TO FALL IN SOME CASES WON'T. WE ALL TO NO END OF LITIGATION WITH OUR WATER DISTRICTS AND SOME OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND STAKEHOLDERS. IT'LL GO ON DECADES AND DURING THOSE DECADES. NOTHING CHANGES NO IMPROVEMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT NO MORE SECURITY FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND THAT IS UNFORTUNATE. WHERE THE FIRST YEAR OF A TWO YEAR SESSION MEMBERS. THERE'S TIME. THERE'S NO NEED THERE'S NO URGENCY THERE'S NO DEADLINE THIS EVENING THE REQUIRES US TO MOVE THIS BILL TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. AND FRANKLY IF WE'RE. GOING TO MOVE THIS BILL THE GOVERNOR'S DESK I HOPE THE GOVERNOR'S THAT BACKSTOP THAT WE NEED I HOPE THAT HE CAN STAND UP AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE PARKS WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO EMBRACE COMPROMISE AND CONSENSUS BAD WORDS IN TWENTY NINETEEN POLITICS MAYBE BAD WORDS IN SOME OF YOUR- DISTRICTS. BUT THEY'RE NOT BAD WORDS WHEN IT COMES TO POLICY MAKING. SO PLEASE CONSIDER BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS IMPORTANT VOTE IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE BIPARTISAN ISSUE FOR THOSE OF US. IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THEIR CULTURAL COMMUNITIES. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. HERE TONIGHT. THING WAS GRAY MISTER STONE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. THIS IS TRULY A CALIFORNIA ISSUE. AND FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS LONG BEEN A FEDERALIST IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME. THIS IS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKING DOWN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS PROTECTIONS CIVIL RIGHTS TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN. I HEAR THE RHETORIC HERE I HEAR THE FEAR. BUT THIS IS BEEN BLOWN UP TO BE MORE THAN IT REALLY IS THIS IS CALIFORNIA WHO HAS RELIED ON FEDERAL POLICY FOR MANY YEARS GOOD FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY FOR MANY YEARS. AND WE HAVE BUILT OUR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. WITH GAPS IN IT BECAUSE OF WHAT THE FEDS IT DONE NOW THE FEDS ARE TAKING AWAY SIGNIFICANT PIECES OF WATER PROTECTION LAW OF AIR PROTECTION LAW AND CALIFORNIA HAS TO STEP INTO THE VOID. THIS IS FILLING THAT VOID THERE IS NO OTHER TIME TO BE DOING IT RATHER THAN NOW BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION IS FINDING ITS- VOICE AND FINDING ITS- WAY OF STARTING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN TEARING DOWN WHAT WE HAVE LONG VALUE. SO IF WE'RE NOT WILLING TO SAY THIS IS ABOUT CALIFORNIA LAW. AND ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS IN SPITE OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. THEN THEN DON'T KNOW WHAT CALIFORNIA IS REALLY ABOUT OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING TO US TO SET A FRAMEWORK. TO SHOW HOW TO PUSH BACK AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD ON TO WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY VALUABLE. NOW THIS BILL. PUTS IN PLACE CALIFORNIA RULES WHERE THERE HAD BEEN FEDERAL RULES THAT'S REALLY ALL IT DOES. THERE ARE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS IS THERE ARE WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF. CAN BE DEALT WITH UNDER THIS AND IT RELIES ON THE ADMINISTRATION TAKING STEP. BY STEP BY STEP TO IDENTIFY. WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS WALKING BACKWARDS IN WHERE AREAS WE DON'T WANT THEM TO AND CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE TO STEP INTO. THAT VOID. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. IT IS TIME WE STAND UP FOR OURSELVES IT IS TIME WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT SO DEPENDENT ON THE VAGARIES OF FEDERAL POLICY THAT UP TILL NOW HAD BEEN STALWART. AND NEVER AN OUR ROADING FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER. THIS IS A GOOD BILL MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST EITHER. DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU CHAIR ARM I'D LIKE TO READ FROM THE SALMON FISHER SAID ABOUT OBJECTION INDUSTRY. UP THEIR COMMENTS ARE GIVING IS CLEAR THAT THE TWO THOUSAND NINE PROTECTIONS BEEN AN ADEQUATE TO STOP THE DECLINE LISTED BAY DELTA SALMON RUNS. YET IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ABANDONED SCIENCE IN THIS DEVELOPING NEW DRAMATICALLY WEAKER BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FOR LISTED BAY DELTA SALMON SPECIES SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR DEVON BERNHARDT FORMER LOBBYIST FOR THE WEST PLAINS WATER DISTRICT. HAS ENGINEERED THE REASSIGNMENT OF TWENTY TO THIRTY FEDERAL AGENCY STAFF WHO ARE EXPERTS ON SALMON IN THE BAY DELTA IN THEIR PLACE HE HAS APPOINTED THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION TO THE TEAM RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE CONDITION VERREAUX'S PERMIT. THIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST WILL LEAD TO A DRAMATICALLY FLAWED FINAL FEDERAL BIOLOGICAL OPINION IN FACT THAT NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINION COULD PROVE TO BE WEAKER THAN THE SCIENTIFICALLY AND LEGALLY FLAWED RULES LED TO THE SHUTDOWN EVERY INDUSTRY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE. SB ONE IS A CENTRAL TO HELP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESPOND IN A TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MANNER TO THIS AND EVERY OTHER. FEDERAL ROLL BACKS I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SP ONE AND- THE REALITY IS. THAT THIS IS NOT AND I AGREE EVEN WITH THOSE BEGIN OPPOSITION THAT THIS IS NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE. AN ISSUE OF PARTISANSHIP BUT IT IS AN ISSUE BASED ON FACT. BECAUSE WE MUST REMEMBER THAT EVEN. FOR DECADES WE THINK ABOUT PRESIDENT NIXON THE BY NOW PROTECTION PROTECTION AGENCY WE THINK ABOUT LONG STANDING LAWS INCLUDING A BILL I HAD A THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED UNDER BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS IT WAS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WITHIN A YEAR THE PULLED US OUT OF THAT TREATY. SO IT'S NOT ABOUT REPUBLICAN A DEMOCRAT IT IS ABOUT AND MINISTRATION RIGHT NOW. THAT IS DISMANTLING ONE BY ONE DAY BY DAY. BUT NOT JUST CALIFORNIA HAS BILL WHAT THIS NATION HAS DONE TO SHOW THAT IT HAS A COMMITMENT TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THE URGENCY. IS NOT IN MY CONCERN THAT THE GOVERNOR OR THAT THIS BODY OR THAT THE SENATE. ISN'T WILLING TO WORK AND TO CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH CONSTITUENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITH THE SCIENCE WITH ENSURING THAT WE CAN PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE THAT INDUSTRY CAN CONTINUE TO THRIVE I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH WHETHER. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE WILLING TO DO THAT THE URGENCY IS THE FACT THAT EVERY DAY WE WAIT AS WE SEE. COMING NOT JUST WITH ADMINISTRATION A CABINET MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE RAVAGED OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR DECADES. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DISMANTLE WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS FOUGHT FOR SO LONG WE CAN'T CONTROL WHAT WASHINGTON DC IS DOING A WHAT THE LEADERSHIP OR LACK THERE OF IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS DOING WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER IN OUR SO. IN AND WHAT WE DO HERE ON THIS FOR WHAT WE DO FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND NOT JUST OTHER STATES OTHER NATIONS ARE LOOKING AT US AND WORKING WITH US. IN TERMS OF FIGHTING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IN TERMS OF AIR QUALITY IN TERMS OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WILDLIFE. NOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S NOT ONLY DISMANTLING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS THEY'RE ALSO DISMANTLING LONG STANDING WORKER PROTECTIONS. INCLUDES PROPOSING TO WEAKEN LIMITS ON WORKPLACE EXPORT EXPOSURE TO BRILLIANT. IT INCLUDES. IT INCLUDES UP ROLLING BACK WORKPLACE REPORTING. AND INJURIES AT THE WORKPLACE SO THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT ROLLING BACK ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS IT'S ROLLING BACK PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE THAT WORK. TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY OUR ENVIRONMENT IS PROTECTED BUT DOES NOT WORK IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE TRYING THEIR BEST TO MITIGATE THEIR DAMAGE THAT THE WORKERS ARE PROTECTED AND SO I IMPLORE YOU TO SUPPORT SB ONE WE'RE NOT GONNA STOP WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT ARE LEGISLATION MATCHES THE SCIENCE AND THERE ARE SIGNS OF EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL INDUSTRIES TO ENSURE WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT TO SAY THAT WE CAN TRUST THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION TO HAVE OUR BACK IS A JOKE. AS I EMPLOYEE TO SUPPORT SB ONE. MS BARRICADE HEN CORRECTNESS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY AS A MOTHER. THREE KIDS THAT ARE GOING TO INHERIT THIS WORLD. AND WHAT DO THEY DESERVE. THEY DESERVE CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE AND CLEAN WATER TO DRINK THEY DESERVE A ONE WORLD AS LEAST AS CLEAN AS THE ONE WE INHERITED. USED TO ONE FOR THEM TO DO THEIR TO GET A WORLD BETTER THAN THE ONE WE INHERITED BUT I'VE GIVEN UP ON THAT ALL EXCEPT AT LEAST AS GOOD AS THE ONE WE INHERITED. AND RIGHT NOW THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN ISSUE I WANT TO REMIND THIS BODY THAT THE EPA WAS STARTED UNDER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. ACTING THE ENTIRE MENTION VIETNAM PARTISAN IN A BIPARTISAN ISSUE. BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE TO DRINK THIS WATER IN PRE THIS AIR. AND SO I IMPLORE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO TAKE THE PARTISANSHIP OUT OF THIS AND TO REMEMBER. WHAT IT IS WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY AND THAT IS PROTECTING THE WORLD THAT MY CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. ARE GOING TO INHERIT. AND EVERY DAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ROLLS BACK THESE REGULATIONS. THE HARDER IT GAPS TO PROTECT THAT ENVIRONMENTS. AND I SAT IN COMMITTEE AND I HEARD THIS AND I HEARD THE OPPOSITION. AND I SUPPORTED IT BECAUSE. WHEN WE HEAR JUST THE WEEK ACTUALLY THAT WE HEARD THIS ANY STM WAS THE WEEK THAT THEY ROLL BACKS MINDY INJURED SPECIES REGULATIONS. AND AS I HEARD IT ON MY DRIVE UP HERE I THOUGHT GOD I WISH SB ONE WE'RE LAW RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS. BUT IT WASN'T. BUT I HOPE IT WILL BE. BECAUSE AT THE VERY LEAST. WE SHOULD BE KEEPING OUR REGULATIONS THAT ARE PROTECTIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AS GOOD AS THEY WERE. WHEN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S ALL THIS BILL IS ASKING. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MEMBERS SAYING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. MS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AND I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DEBATE IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE HAVE THAT AND LEGISLATION THAT IS SWEEPING AND IMPORTANT SUCH AS THIS ONE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BILL DOES TOO AND WHAT IT DOESN'T DO. THE BILL DOES NOT. UNDERMINE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. IN TERMS OF WATER. ISSUES THOSE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ARE NOT REGULATIONS THERE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS THAT ARE AGREED TO BY VARIOUS PARTIES AND THEREFORE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. AND IN FACT THOSE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT EVEN IN PLACE YET AS THEY ARE STILL BEING NEGOTIATED. I REMEMBER. THIS BILL IS ABOUT REGULATIONS THAT EXIST TODAY. NOT REGULAR NOT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ENTERED INTO OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THIS BILL WILL NOT TURN AREAS OF THE STATE INTO A DUST BOWL. IF THEY'RE NOT A DUST BOWL TODAY NOTHING SHOULD CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT THEIR WATER IS DELIVERED IN THE WILL AND THEIR WATER RIGHTS ARE ENACTED. THIS BILL DOES NOT FREE SCIENCE. IN FACT. WITH THE IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THE VERY IMPORTANT SECTION THAT DEALS WITH WATER REGULATIONS WAS CHANGE FROM SHOWER TO MAY TO GIVE US THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHICH OF THOSE REGULATIONS AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO IMPOSE RATHER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKING THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT RIGHT. AWAY FROM US. THE BILL DOES NOT WAS NOT SPRUNG ON THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST MINUTE OR NEGOTIATE INNER DARKNESS IN FACT THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED EARLY IN THE SESSION WAS DEBATED MULTIPLE TIMES IN COMMITTEE. THERE WERE HOURS AND HOURS OF MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE THAT RESULTED IN MANY AMENDMENTS BEING TAKEN THE ROUTE THE PAST YEAR AND I THINK MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN THIS BODY SINCE IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. GOING BACK INTO LAST YEAR. WHAT THE BILL DOES DO IS GIVE US TOOLS TO MAINTAIN WHAT WE HAVE NOW. NOW. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAS THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL GESTURE THIS IS HYPERBOLE THIS IS A STATEMENT. THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT. WHAT THIS IS A LACKS JUST DITCH EFFORT FOR CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT. WHAT WE HAVE HAD IN PLACE IN IN SOME REGARDS TAKEN FOR GRANTED FOR DECADES. ACTIONS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED FOR YEARS ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER IN THE FLOORS OF WASHINGTON DC. BEEN RESPECTED BY ADMINISTRATIONS DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND BEFORE WE WERE SO COMFORTABLE AND SO SURE THAT THOSE LONG STANDING REGULATIONS I'M PROTECTIONS WOULD REMAIN. THAT WE NEVER TOOK JURISDICTION OF THEM INTO OUR OWN HANDS. AND NOW IN A IN A PERIOD OF JUST A COUPLE SHORT YEARS WE'VE SEEN THOSE DECADES OF WORK ONE AFTER THE OTHER BEING TAKEN AWAY AND TOPPLE DOWN WITHOUT US HAVING THE CAPACITY TO COME IN EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND RESPOND THROUGH LEGISLATION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE AWAY THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTION OR OTHER ACTIONS. IN A WEEK A LAW THAT WILL TAKE US A YEAR TO PUT BACK INTO PLACE AND WE ARE LEFT MEANWHILE DEFENSELESS FOR OUR WATER AND FOR OUR AIR AND FOR OUR WORKERS LET'S JUST QUICKLY JUST GO THROUGH A FEW OF THOSE HAD BEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO REMIND EVERYONE WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE THE CLEAN WATER ACT TRUMP HAS PUT IT. OUT THERE THAT THAT ENFORCING THE CLEAN WATER ACT IS ONE OF THE EPA'S MOST INTRUSIVE RULES AND SINGLE THAT IS TRANSITION TEAMS WEBSITE FOR POSSIBLE ELIMINATION THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE OF US. HAS TO CARE A LOT ABOUT BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT WATER QUALITY IN THIS BODY AND HOW IMPORTANT IS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO RE EXAMINE THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE STANDARDS WE HAVE FOR LEAD CHROMIUM SIX ARCHERY ARSENIC AND NITRATES IN DRINKING WATER BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THAT THE SCIENCES ESTABLISHED THAT WE SHOULD KEEP THOSE CONTAMINANTS OUT OF OUR WATER. THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT THE ANIMALS THAT I KNOW MY CHILD CARE IS ABOUT PROBABLY YOURS OR BECAUSE HUMPBACK WHALES SOUTHERN SEA OTTERS SEA TURTLES AND THE ICONIC RED LOG FROG TRIGGERED A SECOND LISTEN THAT HE WANTS TO WEAKEN OR REPEAL. ALL TOGETHER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS SAME THING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYING THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO ENFORCE THEM FALL PROTECTION OSHA. SO CODE IN SO ELATION PENALTIES FOR WORKER SAFETY VIOLATION ALL ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION AND IF WE DON'T ACT WE ARE DEFENCELESS. MEMBERS I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB ONE THANK YOU.

AND IT'S MY TURN TO SPEAK MAN. LET ME JUST SAY THE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. UNIQUELY QUALIFIES ME TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAVE I DEALT WITH. I THINK SAFETY. I WORK THESE HOURS IN QUESTION FOR OVER TWO DECADES. LET ME JUST TELL YOU A REALLY QUICK STORY AND I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT QUICK. WHEN I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD. I WOKE UP. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. WITH A BROKEN PELVIS. AND A TRUCK DRIVER HOLDING MY HAND I COULDN'T SEE BECAUSE BLOOD HAD CAKED. ACROSS MY FACE. MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT I HAD LEARNED HOW TO WALK AGAIN. BECAUSE THE DRIVER FELL ASLEEP. DURING THESE HOURS FATIGUE IS IMMENSE AND IT GETS. EXPONENTIALLY WORSE AS THE TIME TICKS AWAY. NOW WE ARE ALSO WHAT WE THIS BILL CONSIDERS. EXTENDING THE TIME THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO BE DEALING WITH FATIGUE BUT ALCOHOL IMPAIRMENT. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT UP I NEED TO I FEEL RESPONSIBLE TO SHARE WITH YOU. REALITY ALL THE POLITICS OUT. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A RIGHT LEFT ISSUE THIS IS A RIGHT OR WRONG ISSUE. LET ME JUST TELL YOU. DEATH WILL COME BECAUSE OF THIS POLICY ADDITIONAL DEATH. THAT'S WRONG I DON'T TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL I DON'T CARE WHO'S IN CHARGE A POLICY THAT IS GOING TO FACILITATE NEEDLESS DEATH. BOOKS I'VE SAT IN THE IN THE HOMES OF PEOPLE TO SHARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST NEWS. HAVE LOST LOVED ONES BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE PAIRED. ALCOHOLISM PERRY SUBSTANCE AND PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE TO DRIVE IMPAIRED. AND WHEN WE EXTEND THAT. JUST SOLD THERE'S SOME KIND OF I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF GAME YOU TRADE FOR LIFE. I REALLY DON'T I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY. THIS IS A. LET'S SEE THAT IS SO ALARMING TO ME THAT. IT'S COME THIS FAR. I MEAN I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE JUSTIFICATION HERE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOSS OF LIFE AND IT'S AN ARGUABLE THAT THIS POLICY WILL RESULT. THE POLICY WILL. IS GOING TO ADD TO DEATH. TRAGIC DEATH UNNECESSARY DEATH. I JUST AS YOU PUSH THE GREEN BUTTON BECAUSE I KNOW TOO MANY OF YOU WILL. I JUST WANT TO STAND AS A WITNESS TO YOU. THAT IT'S GOING TO SEND SOME PEOPLE TO THEIR GRAVE. HOW YOU RECONCILE THAT I'LL NEVER KNOW. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME BECAUSE I'M DONE BEFORE MIDNIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY MISTER FRAZIER. YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. YOU'VE SEEN US TRY TO GET AT ADD ADDITIONAL CHP OFFICERS IN THE LAST SESSION. YOU ALL UNANIMOUSLY VOTED FOR ADDING FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY OFFICERS OVER FOUR YEARS WHICH WAS VETOED LAST YEAR BY THE GOVERNOR WE ARE DOWN ONE THOUSAND CHP OFFICERS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MOST OF OUR CITIES ARE CONSTRAINED FOR POLICE ENFORCEMENT. THEY'RE GOING OUT TRYING TO DO SALES TAX MEASURES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE MORE OFFICERS. TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY. WHY ARE WE GOING TO PUT MORE LAWS ON THE BOOKS TO ALLOW. A LARGER BURDEN ON PUBLIC SAFETY. UNTIL WE FIX THE MATTER OF THE PROBLEM FIRST. I LOST A DAUGHTER IN A CAR ACCIDENT. AND THANKS TO. THE FIRST RESPONDERS THE HIGHWAY PATROL MY LITTLE GIRL LIFT. WE'RE UNDERSTAFFED UNDER MANNED. AND WE CAN NOT CONTINUE TO ADD A BURDEN TO PUBLIC SAFETY I ASK YOUR NOVA. MISTER COOPER I'LL BE QUICK IF YOU THINK ABOUT AND HEARING THIS BILL EVERY HEARING CHP NEVER OPPOSED IT. WHAT IT SEES PETER TESTIFIED TO HEARING. WHO SEES P. WORK FOR THAT'S A BIG QUESTION IN THEIR TESTIFIED THE SOCIALIZATION NEVER OPPOSE THE BILL. AND FINALLY THEY BOTH OPPOSE THE BILL THE FIFTY MINISTRATION AND THE RECORD FILED ASSOCIATION. BUT THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT THAT'S WITH THE BIGGEST THING IS A BIG ISSUE PEOPLE DO DRIVE DRUG THEY DO SILLY THINGS RIGHT NOW NOT HAS NOT GONE DOWN. THE TALK ABOUT THE MONEY AS FAR AS FUNDING AND LOCALS GET TOGETHER AND DO THAT BUT THE PAY FOR CH PEACEFUL SACRAMENTO FIFTH LARGEST COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW GRAVEYARD. THERE ARE TWO TWO MILLION UNITS SOUTH OF THE RIVER AND ONE SERGEANT. TO TOO MANY VETS NORTH THE RIVER ONE SERGEANT YOU CAN ASK THAT YOU COME TO JEOLLABUK SOMEONE. YOU'RE OFF THE STRETS. THAT'S WHAT IT IS A GREAT ROCK IS GRAVEYARD MOST FOLKS ARE ASLEEP. EXCEPT PEOPLE GOING OUT AND YOU KNOW DOING SILLY THING SO. YOUR STAFFING IS LOW. EVEN FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT DOWNTOWN IS LOW STAFFING BECAUSE- GRAVEYARD YOUR SLOW SHIFT. SO IT'S VERY EASY GET TIED UP ON A CRASH. ON A RESTRICTED VIEW FOR TWO HOURS. AND LATER ON THE MORNING'S GUESS LATER. ALSO TRYING TO FINISH THE REPORTS. BEFORE THE GOING TO WATCH BECAUSE I'M GRAY YOU'RE GETTING OFFICE SIX OR SEVEN. THEY'VE GOT TO FINISH THE REPORTS. SO THEY'RE NOT OUT THEIR HUNT FOR DRUNK DRIVERS AT SOME POINT BECAUSE- THEY DON'T WANT THEM HAVING OVER TIME IN MY COLLEAGUES LOCALLY. HAS TRIED TO GET SEIZE POSITIONAL FUNDING. FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND YOU SURE THEY'RE TURNED DOWN. SO SEIZE PEOPLE TOOLS ARE FREE BUT FOR SACRAMENTO ON THE FREEWAYS. IN NIGHT. TIME YOU HAVE A TOLD THINK ABOUT THAT. TOLL OF TEN OFFICERS. IT'S NOT VERY MANY OFFICERS AND IN THE BAY AREA THE SAME THING LA COUNTY THE SAME THING FOR DRIVING ON FREEWAYS SO JUST SOMETHING THINK ABOUT IT SOUNDS GOOD BUT IT WHAT COST TO THINK ABOUT IT YOU GO OVER THE JAIL RIGHT NOW. EVEN A FRIDAY NIGHT LOCALS AGAIN LOOK FOR DRUNK DRIVING THAT'S A LABRYS PROCESS TO GO DOWN THERE THE TODDLER'S GONNA BLOW ON IT FILL OUT PAPERWORK TAKE THE PROPERTY HAVE THE NURSE EXAMINE THEM SO. IT'S A VERY LENGTHY PROCESS IS SOMETHING THINK ABOUT SO JOURNAL VOTE. MISTER MESS YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU SPEAK YOUR COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BUT NOT BECAUSE I DON'T AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION. ADD TO THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY ARE A RIGHT. BUT CALIFORNIA'S IN THE INCREDIBLY DIVERSE STATE. THERE ARE OVER WITH OUR FOUR HUNDRED AND MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED CITIES THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES IS DIFFERENT I'LL TELL YA I DON'T THINK THREE O'CLOCK IS THE RIGHT NUMBER I DON'T THINK TWO O'CLOCK IS THE RIGHT NUMBER. IT STARTED OFF AT FOUR O'CLOCK I THINK THAT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHAT THAT WHAT WHAT THAT OUR IS AND IF YOU BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT IS BEST THAT WHICH GOVERNS CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE THEN WHY NOT GIVE OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. THIS DECISION FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE. THIS EVENING AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL. MISS KOREA YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FIFTY EIGHT LATE NIGHT CLOSING TIMES HAVE BEEN EXAMINED IN ALL FIFTY STATES AND HAVE BEEN COMPARED TO THE DO YOU AYE STATISTICS PROVIDED FROM THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CORRELATION BETWEEN STATES WOULD LATER CLOSING TIMES AND HIGHER RATES OF DRUNK DRIVING IN FACT ONE STUDY DONE BY THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE ECHOED THIS FINDING EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS EXTENDING DRINKING HOURS. BY UP TO TWO HOURS DOES NOT AFFECT EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION OR INCREASED ALCOHOL RELATED HARMS IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS BILL STRICT LOCAL CONTROL AS NO CITY WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS EXTENDING CLOSING OUR WITHOUT THE CITY COUNCIL FIRST VOTING TO APPROVE THE ORDINANCE AND DEVELOPING AN APPROVING A LOCAL PLAN SHOWING THAT PUBLIC NECESSITY AND CONVENIENCE WILL BE SERVED NEXT THE CITY MUST CONVENE A PUBLIC SAFETY TASK FORCE COMPROMISED OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND C. H. P. OFFICIALS TO DEVELOP. A PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN OF ACTION TO KEEP THEIR COMMUNITIES SAFE THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MY COMMUNITY OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THIS PLAN MUST ALSO EXHIBIT RESIDENTS AND BUSINESS SUPPORT AND SHOW THAT TRANSPORTATION SERVICES ARE READILY ACCESSIBLE BEFORE IT IS EVEN SUBMITTED TO THE STATE FOR APPROVAL ESSENTIALLY SB FIFTY EIGHT REQUIRES LOCALITIES TO GO THROUGH NUMEROUS PROTECTION MEASURES TO ENSURE THE ENTIRE CITY IS AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE IT IS TIME THAT WE RE EXAMINE OUR STATE WHY CLOSING HOURS. AND GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS BEST. FOR OUR COMMUNITIES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THE MYSTERY OF MS MELENDEZ. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS SPEAKERS BEFORE ME WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MADE SOME VERY GOOD POINTS I THINK THERE ARE A FEW THAT WE WANT TO ADD TO THIS NUMBER ONE GOVERNOR BROWN DID VETO THIS BILL ARE READY AND FOR VERY GOOD REASON I WOULD URGE YOU TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT HIS VETO MESSAGE NUMBER TWO THE LA CITY COUNCIL. IS AGAINST THIS MEASURE. UNANIMOUSLY I BELIEVE. THE THIRD POINT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE TO YOU IS. I WANT TO APPEAL TO THE PARENTS IN THIS ROOM. AND THIS IS A YOUNGER LEGISLATURE NOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN AT HOME. SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOUR YOUNG CHILDREN ARE GOING TO PLAY SPORTS LIKE MINE DO. AND MY CHILDREN WHEN THEY'RE SPORTS LEAGUES STARTS DEREK PRACTICE IF FIVE IN THE MORNING WHICH MEANS THEY'RE ON THE ROAD A FOUR THIRTY IN THE MORNING TO GET A PRACTICE. TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS A LOCALIZED ISSUE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STAYING OUT LATER AND DRINKING WILL ONLY STAY IN THAT LOCAL AREA TO DRIVE HOME. IS A FALSE ASSUMPTION THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO OTHER COMMUNITIES. IN DO YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR CHILDREN IN EVERYONE ELSE'S CHILDREN AT RISK. BY HAVING MORE PEOPLE WHO RIDE TOO MUCH TO DRINK ON THE ROAD HE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE THE LIVES. OF YOUR BABIES YOUR CHILDREN YOU THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT IS IT WORTH IT. TO ALLOW A FEW MORE HOURS OF DRINKING ISN'T WORTH IT. TO PUT CHILDREN AT RISK. I ORIGINAL VOTE. MEASURE OF ARNOLDI THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM NOT A PARTICULAR FAN OF BARS AND THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME KNOW I'M PROBABLY AMONGST THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE FOUND AT A BAR AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. HOWEVER I AM A FAN ALSO OF LOCAL CONTROL LIKE MOST OF YOU. I SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT I WAS THE MAYOR OF A CITY AND I REMEMBER VIVIDLY. HOW FRUSTRATING IT WAS TO BE TOLD BY PEOPLE IN SACRAMENTO WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WHAT WAS WRONG FOR MY COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S WHY I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT THIS IS NOT A STATE WIDE LAW THIS IS A NARROWLY TARGETED PILOT PROGRAM. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. THE CRUCIBLE OF EXPERIMENTATION AND GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS A WAY OF FINDING OUT WHETHER OR NOT. SOME OF THE OBJECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE TONIGHT ARE TRUE. THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO BE PART OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. THEY HAVE ALREADY ARE DECIDED AT THE CITY COUNCIL LEVEL THAT THIS IS GOOD FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEY WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH A PAGES LONG LIST. OF PUBLIC SAFETY REQUIREMENTS PUBLIC HEARINGS I ENGAGEMENT WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO JOIN. SO I THINK THAT WE ARE TAKING A BALANCED APPROACH HERE. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD LET OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEN. WHEN THIS PILOT PROGRAM IS RUN ITS COURSE. SEVERAL YEARS FROM NOW WE CAN LOOK AT THE STATISTICS AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT. THIS WAS A REASONABLE POWER TO GIVE THEM. AND I SUSPECT THE ANSWER WILL BE YES BUT IF THE ANSWER IS NO. THEN WE SHOULD TERMINATE THE PILOT PROGRAM. BUT BECAUSE I'M A BELIEVER IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT I ORIGINAL VOTE. THIS MURATSUCHI. I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE. THE IRONY THAT. WE HAVE. SO MANY PEOPLE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TALKING ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL WHEN WE VOTED ON SO MANY BILLS TODAY TO TAKE AWAY LOCAL CONTROL YOU KNOW TO BUILD MORE HOUSING AND YET HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL SO THAT WE CAN SELL GIVE OUR PURCHASE ALCOHOL BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TO A AND A FOUR AM. I BELIEVE. THREE AM. TO AIMED AT THREE AM I STAND CORRECTED. I. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE STATISTICS THAT THERE ARE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM YOU STILL A CITED BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THOSE STATISTICS TO ME. IT JUST. MAKES COMMON SENSE THAT OFFERING SELLING ALCOHOL A LATER HOUR WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE D. WISE WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE DEATHS I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANKS THANK YOU FOR THE DEBATE MEMBERS SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE ITEM MISTER SANTIAGO YOU MAY CLOSE. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK THE ENTIRE BODY FOR PUTTING A ROBUST ARGUMENT BEFORE US BUT LET'S BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS A MODEST BILL. COMPARED TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PASSED BEFORE ON THIS ISSUE. LET ME CORRECT THE FAX IT'S THREE AM IT'S NO LONGER FOUR AM. IT'S TEN CITIES AND IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM. L. LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR BECAUSE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT LA PAST RESOLUTE LUCIEN AGAINST IT. LA ASKED TO BE IN IT OR IT WOULD NOT BE IN IT. THE TEN CITIES WERE IT IT REEKS WERE REQUESTED TO BE IN ITS. YES OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED BUT WE DO HAVE THE LETTER THE REQUESTED TO BE IN IT. LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR IT WAS BROUGHT UP CONVERSATIONS OF BEING BROUGHT UP ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE C. H. P.'S NEUTRAL. LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. NO THEY HAD A CHOICE THEY CAN SUBMIT A SUPPORT LETTER BECAUSE THE MINUTE OPPOSITION LETTER AND THEY CAN MAKE ARGUMENTS LIKE ANYBODY ELSE BUT THEY'RE NEUTRAL. BUT WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THAT AND WE CAN TABLE THAT FOR SECOND. LET'S ALSO TALK ABOUT THE WAY THE ECONOMY IS CHANGED. PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED. IF YOU GO DOWN AS SOME OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. PEOPLE GET OFF OF WORK AT TEN PEOPLE GET OFF AT ELEVEN. WE'RE NOT EVERYBODY GETS UP AT SIX IN THE MORNING AND I BABIES TUCKED IN BED AT NINE AT NIGHT. LET'S BE VERY CLEAR. AND SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WE REPRESENTS. IF YOU TALK ABOUT LOS ANGELES YOU TALK ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO OR SOME OF THESE OTHER AREAS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR CONVENTION CENTERS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING OUT AT TEN ELEVEN O'CLOCK. WE ARE NOTTALKING ABOUT FOLKS RUNNING AMOK LET'S BE VERY CLEAR. AND IT'S AND IT WAS SAID BEFORE BUT I'LL RESTATE ITS ABOUT PURE LOCAL CONTROL. NO ONE IS GOING TO FORCE IMAGES A PAL DID YOU DO ANYTHING. EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY THAT THERE IS A VERY ROBUST. PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE IN INTO THIS PILOT PROGRAM. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE INVOLVED. ABC WILL BE INVOLVED AND THE LOCAL COUNCIL WILL BE INVOLVED SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU PASS IS BUILT INTO MORROW MORNING EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE DRINK UNTIL THREE O'CLOCK AT MORNING THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS A SAYS THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WILL HAVE THE ABILITY WHERE THEY DEEM RESPONSIBLE. THROUGH A RIGOROUS PROCESS THAT INVOLVES LAW ENFORCEMENT THREE A RIGOROUS PROCESS THAT INVOLVES ABC TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES THEY COULD DECIDE THAT IT'S POTENTIALLY AT VENUES WORK WHERE YOU HAVE A HOTEL ROOM THEY COULD DECIDE THAT IT'S ONLY ONE DAY A YEAR THEY COULD DECIDE THAT THEY DON'T DO IT AT ALL BUT THEY'VE REQUESTED. THE ABILITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEMSELVES. SO TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT GIVES YOUR LOCAL CONTROL. WITH A STRONG FRAMEWORK IN A IN A VIGOROUS PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THIS THAT'S ALL IT DOES. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BUILT. WITH THAT CLICK LIBERAL.

STILL BEGAN BEFORE EIGHT THIRTY AM SO EARLY THAT THEY PREVENT MOST TEENS FROM GETTING THE DOCTOR DOCTOR RECOMMENDED NINE HOURS OF SLEEP FOR THEIR GROWING BODIES AND BRAIN NEEDS. GOING THE CDC THE AVERAGE SECONDARY START TIMES IN CALIFORNIA IS EIGHT OH SEVEN A. M. AND MANY START WELL BEFORE SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING. RELEASE SECOND SECONDARY SCHOOL START TIMES HARM CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND SAFETY AND MANY WAYS. INSUFFICIENT HEALTH AMONG ADOLESCENTS BECAUSE HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. OBESITY DIABETES DROWSY DRIVING WHILE DRIVE CAR ACCIDENTS SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SPORTS INJURIES. THIS IS AN EXPANSIVE EVIDENCE SPANNING DECADES THAT WHEN SCHOOL STARTS LATER TEENS GET MORE SLEEP THEY'RE HEALTHIER THEY'RE HAPPIER THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO COMP AND CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE LESS LIKELY TO GET IN CAR ACCIDENTS AND THEIR TENETS GO UP THEIR GRADES GO UP IN GRADUATION RATES GO UP. MEMBERS I WILL NOT BELABOR THE POINT BECAUSE THE HOURS LATE BUT I NEED YOUR VOTE ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM TODAY AND YESTERDAY WE START A LITTLE LATER IN THE LEGISLATURE AND ALL OF YOUR HAPPY ABOUT IT. SO IF YOU LIKED IT. I THINK IT'S PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH FOR OUR CHILDREN TO START LATER AS WELL SO I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE MISTER SPEAKER PLEASE VOTE YES ON ON SAYS SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY EIGHT. I'M NOT SURE OF THE WORD LATER IS A SELLING POINT RIGHT NOW MISTER GLORIA. DOCTOR CHOI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. SPEAKER ON THE MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF IS SO SB THREE. TWENTY EIGHT THIS BILL WAS BROUGHT. IS TO A PROHIBITS THE MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS OF FROM OPENING BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK OR EIGHT THIRTY. AM. COLLEAGUES SO WE DEALT WITH THESE SAME BILL I BELIEVE LAST YEAR. I UNDERSTAND THE ALSO SO INTENTIONS OF BEHIND THIS BILL. AND THE FEELING SELF THE CONCERN OF THE CHILDREN OF THE CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER I FEEL LIKE GOD THIS BILL IS THE WRONG APPROACH TO THE ISSUE. AS SO SOME OF US ARE COLLEAGUES ARE ARE TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES TO BE UP HERE AT THE CAPITOL. AND THEN ALSO I HAD TO GET UP EARLY TOMORROW MORNING TO GET SAKIC OF FLIGHT TO HOME. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST STATE AND AS SUCH THE SUNLIGHT. AND THE LIFE ACROSS THIS STATE IS THE DIFFERENT DEPENDING UPON WHERE YOU LIVE. WHAT I MEAN COLLEAGUES SO IS THAT ON A DAY OUT WE HAD THE SUN RISES IN SAN DIEGO AT THE SEVEN FORTY. THE SAME SUN NOT WOULD BE RISING IN SOME FRANCISCO. AT EIGHT TWENTY AM AND THE CRESCENT CITY AT THE EIGHT FORTY AM. IN ADDITION TO THIS. THIS STUDY THAT THE INSPIRED THE DESPAIR Là HAS BEEN ANALYZE THAT AND THE NAME THE INCONCLUSIVE. THE EVIDENCE IS SOME MIXED. THERE IS A FURTHER NEED FOR RESEARCH. GIVE ME FOR WE CHANGE TIMES FOR SCORES THE TIME THAT THE PARENTS SO CALLED WORK DOES NOT CHANGE. SO THEREFORE CHILDREN WOULD BE IN SCHOOL LONGER. WITH THE LAST TIME TO DO HOMEWORK AND THE LAST US TO THE BALL ORDER TO GET THE. THEY CAN NO JUST A DAY OR LIFESTYLE KNOWING THAT THAT THEY HAVE TO GET UP EARLY MORNING THINKING WATER BED DAHLE EARLY. IN THE EVENING. IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THIS CITY A CITY OF IRVINE. THEY YOU STOP THOSE SOME SCORES ARE HIGH SCHOOL THAT THE MY CHILDREN ATTENDED THE SEVEN THIRTY. THE STATE. FOR THIS REASON SIZE STRONG YOU HEARD YOU AND NOBLE. LET THE GOVERNOR. MS BURKHARDT BATH YOUR RECOGNIZE YES MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS YOU ALL KNOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AS YOU ALL KNOW MY YOU MET MY SON MONTEREY IS ELEVEN YEARS OLD HE STARTED MIDDLE SCHOOL THIS YEAR IF WE HAVE PUT HIM IN THE SCHOOL IS MEANT TO GO TO HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CATCH THE BUS AT SIX FORTY FIVE IN THE MORNING. YOU TELL ME THAT'S OKAY WE HAVE SCIENCE WE HAVE DATA WITH THE POWER TO CHANGE THIS SO THE FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN IN THE STATE SO I APPEAL TO YOU AS A MOTHER APPEAL TO YOU AS A PARENT. PLEASE VOTE YES ON THIS BILL. WE NEED TO BE DOING THE RIGHT THING TONIGHT THANK YOU. MR O'DONNELL. YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LET'S SEE WHO SUPPORTS LOCAL CONTROL NOW. I OPPOSE SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT. IT HAS MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES LET ME LIST A FEW OF THEM JUST A FEW OF THEM. SB TWO SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT OF US RATES A LOW OVER THE ROLE OF LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND SETTING THE BELL SCHEDULES. I DENTURES MANY PARENTS WILL HAVE CHILD CARE PROBLEMS IN THE EARLY MORNING. AND SOCIETY TELLS US THAT BURDEN WILL TYPICALLY FALL ON WOMEN. SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT WILL REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PURCHASE AND OPERATE MORE SCHOOL BUSES THIS IS COSTLY. SB THREE TWENTY OR REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO FLIP THEIR SCHEDULES SO MENTERI SCHOOL STUDENTS GO EARLIER THAN THEY PRESENTLY DO. SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT HAMMER IS A SCHOOL DISTRICT'S ABILITY TO USE BLOCK SCHEDULING SPECIALLY THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL NOT THAT MEANS MORE ACADEMIC TIME. FOR STUDENTS SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT THREATEN C. T. E. AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS THAT START IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT HAS TECHNICAL FLAWS THAT MAY LEAD TO A LOSS OF EIGHTY EIGHT THERE SOME UNKNOWNS THERE. SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT KILLS EARLY MORNING SPORTS SPORTS PROGRAMS LIKE SURFING AND MY OWN COMMUNITY. WE WON'T HAVE SERVE TEAMS ANYMORE MY CHILD'S ON A SURF TEAM SO I KNOW ALL YOU LAND DOGS DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS PEOPLE THAT LIVE NEAR THE OCEAN HAVE SERVE TEAMS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO OUR KIDS. SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT PUT PUTS RURAL STUDENTS IN DANGER. AS A NOW MAY TRAVEL ON A BUS IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT TO GET HOME IN FACT AS I UNDERSTAND IT SOME THESE SCHOOLS ONLY OPERATE FOUR DAYS A WEEK SO THEIR DAY. IS ACTUALLY LONGER SO YOU'LL BE PUSHING THOSE BUSING HOURS INTO THE INTO IT INTO THE HOURS WHEN IT'S DARK. RECENT STUDIES SHOW. THAT LATER START TIME SIMPLY LEAD TO CHILDREN GOING TO BED LATER. AND IF YOU HAVE A TEENAGER YEAH NO THAT'S VERY TRUE. SO LET'S. LET'S SUPPORT LOCAL CONTROL. VOTE NO ON THIS WE SHOULD NOT SET. THE BELL SCHEDULE FROM SACRAMENTO. SACRAMENTO DOES NOT KNOW BEST. MR GLORIA. MR. FOR THE BILL MISTER CALDERON IS NOT AS DESK. THIS YOUR OBERNOLTE. MISTER% SPEAKER I RISE AS SEEMS TO BE MY HABIT THIS EVENING TO ARGUE IN SUPPORT OF ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC BILL. SO I HAVE JUST FINISHED MY SIX YEAR AND FINAL YEAR AS THE PARENT OF A HIGH SCHOOLER. AND WHERE WE LIVE IN BIG BEAR LAKE FIRST BELL FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL FOR FIRST PERIOD RINGS AT SIX FIFTY FIVE AM. AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM SIX YEARS OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. THAT MANY TIMES MY SONS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DRIVING SAFELY. THAT EARLY IN THE MORNING AND JUST IN THE LAST YEAR I HAVE DRIVEN MY SON TO SCHOOL RATHER THAN HAVE HIM DRIVE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HIM DRIVING AT THAT EARLY HOUR. AND THIS LAST YEAR MY YOUNGEST SON HIS FIRST PERIOD WAS AP CALCULUS. SO THINK ABOUT THAT WERE SENDING A TEENAGER. BUT I DON'T EVEN TRUST TO DRIVE AT THAT HOUR IN TO DO AP CALCULUS I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A GOOD RESULT. HI TESTIFIED. IN FOR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IN THE PAST AND I HAVE CITED THE NUMEROUS STUDIES ACROSS THE WORLD THAT HAVE VERIFIED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. THAT LEADER HIGH SCHOOL START TIMES RELIEVED TO DECREASE ABSENTEEISM. DECREASED TARDY'S INCREASED SLEEP INCREASED GRADES INCREASE TEST SCORES AND BETTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES THE DATA IS ABSOLUTELY CRYSTAL CLEAR. BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD A VERY EXCITING DEVELOPMENT JUST IN THE LAST YEAR AND THAT'S THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THE ENTIRE CITY OF SEATTLE. VOTED TO MOVE OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL START TIMES FORWARD. BY ABOUT FIFTY MINUTES. AND BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE WORLD TO MAKE THIS MOVE THERE WAS A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS. THAT ELECTED TO GO IN AND DO A VERY COMPREHENSIVE STUDY AND THEY STARTED BEFORE THE CHANGE WAS MADE AND THEY WANTED DETAILED EMPIRICAL DATA SO RATHER THAN JUST ASKING PEOPLE THEIR OPINIONS THEY ACTUALLY FITTED GROUPS OF STUDENTS WITH SLEEP MONITORS. AND A MONITOR TO BEFORE AND AFTER THE LOOK TO TEST SCORES BEFORE AND AFTER AND THAT DATA WAS JUST PUBLISHED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY FOUND CONTRARY TO WHAT HAS BEEN STATED IN OPPOSITION HERE ON THE FLOOR THEY FOUND THAT STUDENTS DID NOT GO TO SLEEP LATER IN FACT OF THAT FIFTEEN MINUTES THEY MOVED THE START TIME BACK. THE AVERAGE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT GOT AN EXTRA THIRTY FOUR MINUTES OF SLEEP. THEY FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE ARE GRADE FOR THOSE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS INCREASED BY ALMOST 5% TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT THAT'S ALMOST HALF THE AGREED THAT THEY THEY INCREASED ON AVERAGE. THEY HAD SUBSTANTIALLY LESS TARDY'S SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ABSENTEEISM. THOSE ARE POWERFUL RESEARCH RESULTS. AND THEY'RE VERY APPLICABLE TO WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING TODAY NOW I HAVE HEARD. THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS BELIEVE ME I'VE HEARD IT BECAUSE I THINK I'VE GOT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS THAT ARE GONNA BURN BE AN EFFIGY. IF THE GOVERNOR SIGNS THIS BILL THIS YEAR. AND SOME OF THEM HAVE VERY FIRST OF ALL I'VE HEARD. A PARENT CONVENIENCE. WELL TELL YOUR FOR THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO WORK AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTY FIVE IN THE MORNING SO IT'S NOT TERRIBLY CONVENIENT FOR MY PARENTS. BUT IT DEPENDS ON HOW FAR YOU'RE DRIVING I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A WASH. CERTAINLY SCHOOL BUS SCHEDULES IS GOING TO BE A REAL PROBLEM. CERTAINLY HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS IS GOING TO BE WROTE REAL PROBLEM BUT EVEN IF WE HAVE TO BUY A BUNCH OF MORE BUSES AND HIGHER SO MORE BUS DRIVERS. EVEN IF WE HAVE TO PUT LIGHTS ON A BUNCH OF ATHLETIC FIELDS. THIS WILL BE THE SINGLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE THING WE CAN DO. TO IMPROVE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES IN CALIFORNIA. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER ONE OF THE MISTER MARTUCCI. YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW I FEEL REALLY CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY MY STAFF KNOWS THAT I LIKE TO SLEEP IN AND I'M A LATE OWL AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH. MEDICAL EVIDENCE THAT THAT THAT SUPPORTS THIS BUT I WANT TO CITE.A STUDY EIGHT EIGHT A CAUGHT CONTRARY STUDY THAT WAS PUT OUT BY SLEEP SCIENTISTS BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS WHICH A LOT WAS SUBMITTED AND CIRCULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION THAT ALSO OPPOSES THIS BUT THERE THERE LETTER INDICATES THAT BASED ON A COMBINED EIGHTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD OF SLEEP RESEARCH IN OVER TWO DECADES OF STUDY OF ADOLESCENT SLEEP. WE WRITE AND OPPOSITION TO SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT. THEY CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY AN SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A STATE WIDE LIMIT OF EIGHT THIRTY AM FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL START TIMES. ON TOP OF THAT YOU KNOW I WANT TO EMPHASIZE WHAT THE ART THE CHAIR OF THE IS EDUCATION COMMITTEE INDICATED THE COST TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS CASE IN POINT OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THAT THAT'S BECAUSE IF WE ADOPT THIS BILL. IT'S GOING TO IMPOSE THE BEFORE SCHOOL ARE YOU A CHILD CARE EXPENSES IS GOING TO IMPOSE THE BUSING EXPENSES ON A READY STRUGGLING SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE OAKLAND UNIFIED THERE ARE DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE READY STRUGGLING AND THIS IS GOING TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS. YOU KNOW SO AGAIN I KNOW THAT THERE IS THE STRONG EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUT- I THINK THERE IS THERE IS EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY ARE ALSO AND THAT. PRECISELY BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH CONFLICT IN THE EVIDENCE AS WELL AS THE FISCAL IMPACT ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WE SHOULD LEAVE IT TO LOCAL CONTROL. SO I I'M NOT GONNA BE OPPOSE IN THIS BILL BUT YOU KNOW I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL. MR GABRIEL YOUR RECKLESS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I'LL BE BRIEF I JUST WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM MY END TO NEED US AND FROM BIG BEAR I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED LAST YEAR IN THIS BILL CAME UP I WAS VERY MUCH TORN ON THE MEASURE. AND I HAVE A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO IT AND I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT SO I REALLY SAT DOWN AND DUG INTO THE SUPPORT LETTERS IN THE OPPOSITION LETTERS IN THE RESEARCH IN THE EVIDENCE IN THE DATA. AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS TREMENDOUSLY COMPELLING THERE'S A TREMENDOUSLY COMPELLING CASE HERE TO CHANGE SCHOOL SCOTT START TIME AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM TORRANCE THE OPPOSITION THIS YEAR HAS COME UP WITH A LETTER FROM ONE RESEARCHER OPPOSING THIS BILL BUT THERE IS VIRTUAL UNANIMITY IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE SCIENCE IN THE RESEARCH AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOOKED INTO THIS. THEY TELL US ONE VERY SIMPLE FACT THAT MAKING THIS CHANGE WILL SAVE LIVES IT WILL SAVE LIVES IN AVOIDED SUICIDES IT WILL SAVE LIVES IN AVOIDED CAR CRASHES THIS IS IN A MEASURE THAT WE CAN TAKE THAT WILL HELP SAVE LIVES I KNOW THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS NOT TO DO THIS THE INCONVENIENCE FOR SOME FOLKS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE PUT OUT. BUT DO MAKING THIS CHANGE IS A REALLY POWERFUL WAY FOR US TO SAVE LIVES AND I WOULD COURAGE ALL OF YOU TO. VOTE I ON THIS MEASURE. MR KILEY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WOULD ANY BELL WE HAVE TO ASK WHETHER IT'S THE RIGHT POLICY AND WHETHER WERE THE RIGHT INSTITUTION. TO BE MAKING THE POLICY. ON THE FIRST QUESTION AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED. THE OVERWHELMING WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT WHILE SCHOOL START TIMES ARE NOT A PANACEA FOR OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. THEY DO LEAD. MORE THAN MARGINAL. THEN THERE'S THE INSTITUTIONAL QUESTION AND MY OWN PHILOSOPHY IS THAT DECISION MAKING PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD BE MADE AT THE MOST LOCAL LEVEL PRACTICABLE WHERE THE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND VALUES OF COMMUNITIES CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR WE'RE DECISION MAKERS ARE CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE IMPACTED WERE FLEXIBILITY ALLOWS FOR INNOVATION AND FOR IMPROVEMENT THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR AND WE SHOULD REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTION ON THE CROSS JURISDICTIONAL OR STATE LEVEL IN LAST THERE'S A COMPELLING. BASIS FOR DOING SO THAT'S WHY I DID NOT SUPPORT PRIOR VERSIONS OF THIS BILL. BUT I REACHED A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION WITH THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. FOR ONE THING THIS BILL IS HAS BEEN AMENDED IN WAYS THAT ADDS A GREATER LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY AND GET CLOSER TO STRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE AND THE AUTHOR IS COMMITTED TO WORKING IN THE YEARS BETWEEN PASSAGE AN IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED TO IT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BALANCE. IS STRUCK IN THE RIGHT WAY. BUT MORE THAN THAT THERE HAS IN MY VIEW A MERGED A COMPELLING BASIS FOR STATE ACTION AND THAT IS THE DIFFICULTY. THAT THE BARRIERS THAT EXIST DID DISTRICTS THAT ACTUALLY DO WANT TO CHANGE THEIR START TIMES. BECAUSE WE HAVE A STATE WITH A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE YOU CAN HAVE DOZENS OF DISTRICTS WITHIN A GIVEN REGION AND THEY ARE GOVERNED INDEPENDENTLY BUT- THE AFFAIRS OF THESE DISTRICTS ARE INTERTWINED WITH THINGS LIKE TRANSPORTATION. AND EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND SO FORTH AND SO THERE IS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEIR SCHEDULES ARE GENERALLY ALIGNED AND IF YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR DISTRICT THAT WANTS TO CHANGE IT START TIME THAT MY THROAT SO I TO SYNC WITH SCHOOLS IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. THE BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO SO AND I'VE HEARD FROM DISTRICTS THAT FACE THIS VERY DONNA. SO THE TENDENCY IS FOR THE TIMES IN A GIVEN REGION TO BE COORDINATED IN THE MOST NATURAL COORDINATION POINT IS THE STATUS QUO. SO I HAVE YOU THIS BILL AS PROVIDING A NEW COORDINATION POINT THAT IS BASED UPON RESEARCH AND BASED UPON SCIENCE AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME DISTRICTS THAT HAVE CAREFULLY THOUGHT THROUGH THE ISSUE OF START TIMES. THERE WILL HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES AND THAT WEIGHS HEAVILY ON MY OWN THINKING. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE DISTRICTS THAT WILL BE EMPOWERED TO MAKE THE SORT OF CHANGES THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE TO BETTER REFLECT THE PREDICAMENT AND THE DESIRES AND THE INTEREST OF THEIR COMMUNITIES SO IN OTHER WORDS. THE LOCAL CONTROL ARGUMENT CUTS BOTH WAYS. AND AT THAT POINT I THINK WE CAN DEFER TO THE EVIDENCE THAT OVERWHELMINGLY SHOWS. THAT THIS WILL BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA'S KIDS I ASKED FOR A VOTE. MISS SMITH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE AS AN IMMEDIATE FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. AND SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A DISTRICT WHERE NOT A SINGLE ONE OF MY LOCAL DISTRICT CAN FIND THEMSELVES IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AND IT'S NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY FAVOR LOCAL CONTROL BUT A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE PRACTICABILITY OF SCHEDULING IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND SCHEDULING. ON A SCHOOL SITE. WE STILL ARE REMINDED THIS BODY REMAINS ONE OF THE LOWEST FUNDED STATES IN PER PUPIL SPENDING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS MEASURE WILL COST MONEY IT IS QUITE SIMPLY IT WELL INTO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR WHOSE SON WAS ABLE TO TAKE AN A. P. COURSE VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING. VERY OFTEN THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS FACE A CHALLENGE OF MATCHING THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENT POPULATION WITH THE FACILITIES AND THE INSTRUCTIONAL TIME THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. SO FOR MANY MANY KIDS MY OWN INCLUDED THERE OPPORTUNITY PART OF HER DISSIPATE IN BOTH ADVANCED PROGRAMMING AND IN SOME CHILDREN'S CASES REMEDIATION PROGRAMMING DEPENDED ON A SCHEDULE THAT WAS FLEXIBLE THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL DAY. AND YES THE EVIDENCE IS COMPELLING AND I HAVE SHARED WITH THE AUTHOR THAT I DO BELIEVE IT'S COMPELLING I DON'T YET BELIEVE IT IS COMPELLING ENOUGH FOR US TO COMPLETELY OVERRIDE ALL OF THE LOCAL PRACTICAL CONCERNS ASSOCIATED AN AFFILIATED WITH THIS BILL. BECAUSE AMONG MY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HAVE THESE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM ALSO IS IMPLEMENTING STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAMMING NEXT YEAR IN ORDER TO ALSO ADDRESS THOSE VERY KEY AND CRITICAL STUDENT NEEDS. I JUST URGE THAT WE EXT EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION HERE AND TO ALLOW OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS TO DO WHAT'S BEST IN OUR COMMUNITY INTO THE POINTS OF MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE RISEN AND SUPPORT. YOUR LOCAL DISTRICT MAY FIND ITSELF IN SUPPORT AND FIND THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY FOR THEM TO GO AND WE SHOULD SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE THAT ALONG WITH THE PARENT COMMUNITY BEING INVOLVED IN THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BUT FOR US TO MAKE A SWEEPING DECISION LIKE THIS HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHEN IT REALLY HAS. SOME VERY DETAILED PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT VOTE TO TAKE. MISTER CALDERON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISS MEGAN MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I REPRESENT. THE CITY OF LOVE POINT THEY IT IS THE POOREST COMMUNITY IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY AND ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY MOVE THEIR START TIME. AN HOUR LATER THIS IS A SCHOOL WHERE THEY HAD TRUANCY THAT WAS REALLY BAD THEY HAVE POOR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND THEY HAD A LOT OF DISCIPLINARY ISSUES. BY MOVING THAT START TIME AN HOUR LATER TRUANCY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE DISCIPLINARY ACTION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE SIGNIFICANTLY. INCREASED I SUPPORT DOES NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE DATA AND ALL OF THE IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR KIDS. BUT I SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IT IN ACTION AND KNOW THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKS AND I WILL SAY. THAT MY BIGGEST. PET PEEVE OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE HAS EVERY TIME THAT I'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY THE OPPOSITION TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE ADULT'S LIFE. HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE MEMBERS OF THE SCHOOL BOARD WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RESCHEDULE BUS TIMES RESCHEDULE SCHOOL START TIMES AND- EVERYTHING ELSE THE PARENTS. EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE LIVES OF THE ADULTS. SO EASILY WE THEN THROW ASIDE WHAT IS CLEARLY THE RIGHT MOVE WHICH IS THIS IS THE RIGHT THING FOR KIDS I THINK THAT THAT IS INCORRECT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD. DO IN TERMS OF POLICY BECAUSE WE KNOW BECAUSE OF THE EVIDENCE AND THAT ALL OF THE STUDIES IN THE DATA POINT TO THIS BEING THE RIGHT THING. I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING THIS DECISION BASED ON HOW THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT ADULTS LIVES MY KID. CHARLIE SHE'S GONNA START PRESCHOOL VERY SOON. AND I KNOW THAT MY WIFE AND I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO MAKE IT WORK REGARDLESS OF THE TIME THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE STARTING SCHOOL AND I KNOW THAT. SURFING WAS BROUGHT UP AS EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GONNA BE ABLE THE IMPLEMENTERS OR SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU GO EARLY IN THE MORNING ANYWAY SO QUITE HONESTLY THEY'RE GONNA HAVE MORE TIME TO SURF. AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT THING TO SELL I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING. IS THE RIGHT POLICY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. AMOS CALDERON. MR A GLORIA. YOU MAY CLOSE. YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE AN ISSUE THIS HOUSE OR SEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW I THINK THE FIRST YEAR I JOCKEY THIS WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THIS OFF THE FLOOR SECOND YEAR WE DID BUT IT DID NOT PASS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. NOW HERE WE ARE. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. I HEARD THE CONVERSATION I AGREE WITH OUR MAJORITY LEADER YOU KNOW. IF YOU CARE ABOUT CHILDREN THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IS EXTREMELY SIMPLE YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL. YEAH THERE ARE PARENTS WILL SAY THIS IS DIFFICULT THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY'LL TALK ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION THERE IS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL COST BUT I ASK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU IS THERE ANY GREATER COST. TO US IN THE IMPACT ON OUR CHILDREN. AND THE SCIENCE IN THIS DEBATE IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. DATA SPANNING DECADES NOT JUST A YEAR NOT JUST ONE LITTLE FLIMSY STUDY NOT A TWITTER POLL DATA OVER DECADES HAS PROVED THAT NGUYEN SCHOOLS START LATER TEENS GET MORE SLEEP. THEY'RE HEALTHIER THEY'RE HAPPIER THERE MORE LIGHT LET'S THEIR MORE LESS THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET IN CAR ACCIDENTS THERE TENANTS GO UP. THEIR GRADES GO UP THEIR GRADUATION RATES GO UP SO MEMBERS I THINK THIS IS A NO BRAINER BUT I KNOW FOR MANY OF YOU YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS QUESTION. SO IF YOU ARE NOT ELECTED HERE TO PUT CHILDREN FIRST. AND WHY IN THE HELL ARE YOU HERE. RIGHT. RIGHT AND FOR THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THIS CAUCUS MANY OF YOU HAVE MARCHED IN SIGHT IN MARCHES FOR SCIENCE WITH SCIENCE IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THE SCIENCES ON THE SIDE OF VOTING HI ON THIS MEASURE. OKAY. AND IF ANY OF YOU PREFER A TWELVE A CLOCK STARTING TIME FOR THIS LEGISLATURE AS COMPARED TO NINE AM THEN YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO VOTE HI ON THIS MEASURE MEMBER OUR CHILDREN ARE LOOKING TO US FOR LEADERSHIP THE DATA IS CLEAR. TEENS AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS NEED TO START LATER SO I ASK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SET ASIDE THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE MONEY I STATE PEOPLE WHO WILL TELL YOU WHY WE SHOULD NOT DO THIS AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT BY THE CHILDREN OF THIS GREAT STATE AND VOTE I ON SENATE BILL.

ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SEVENTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO EMPLOYMENT. IT'S GONZALEZ GOOD MORNING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED GOOD MORNING MISTER SPEAKER I AM I BRINGING UP AB ONE SEVENTY I WILL START BY TELLING YOU THIS IS A TERRIBLE BILL AND I DO NOT PLAN TO VOTE FOR IT HOWEVER. I DID IN FACT AGREED TO TAKE THIS BILL AS THE ONLY CONDITION IMPOSED UPON ME BY THE SENATE IN ORDER TO GET AB FIVE TAKEN UP EARLIER THIS WEEK. AB ONE SEVENTY PROVIDES A ONE YEAR EXTENSION FOR NEWSPAPERS TO COMPLY WITH THE DYNAMAX AND AB FIVE RULING. AND WHILE THAT MAY SEEM INNOCUOUS. IT IS SOMETHING IT'S FOR NEWSPAPER CARRIERS IN PARTICULAR. NEWSPAPER CARRIERS IF YOU DON'T KNOW IN NEWSPAPER PUBLICATIONS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF MISS CLASSIFYING THEIR WORKERS IN FACT THE FULL. FOUGHT OFF AND ACTUALLY PAID OFF MULTIPLE LAWSUITS UNDER THE PREVIOUS FOR ELLO TEST. THE CASE IS THAT THEY'RE NOW FACE SEEN INCLUDE WE JUST HEARD ABOUT A SEVENTY YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO. WORKS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR. EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND GETS PAID ABOUT THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. IF SHE MISSES THE DAY SHE ACTUALLY HAS TO PAY THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER HUNDRED DOLLARS IF SHE MISSES AYE HOW SHE HAS TO PAY AT A DOLLAR. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MISS MOST EXPLOITIVE. JOBS THAT WE HAVE IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE DYNAMICS RULING IT REALLY WAS MADE FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. THE VISUALS WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY MISCLASSIFIED. WHO UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO ABILITY TO SEARCH THE RIGHTS EXCEPT THROUGH MASSIVE CLASS ACTION SUITS AND THEY'RE OFTEN SETTLED INTO NIGHT JUSTICE SO WE ARE GOING TO DELAY IN TONIGHT JUSTICE FOR ANOTHER YEAR. TO THESE POOREST OF POOR WORKERS MOST OF WHOM ARE WOMEN MANY OF WHOM ARE IMMIGRANTS.

THANK YOU MS REVERSE THIS CALL MADRE THAT YOU'RE RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND GOOD MORNING TO ALL OF YOU ALL I RISEIN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SEVENTY I'M I HAVE A NUMBER OF SMALL ETHNIC BASED FAMILY OWNED NEWSPAPERS IN MY DISTRICT THEY ARE LOCATED IN THE DISTRICT THEY SERVICE THE DISTRICT AND BEYOND I THINK IT IS FAIR TO GIVE THEM A ONE YEAR EXTENSION SO THAT THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO FIND COMPLIANCE WITH THIS LAW AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. THEIR COMMUNITIES MY COMMUNITY WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE RELY ON THANK YOU I ASK FOR YOUR EYE ON AB ONE SEVEN. THANK YOU MS KAMAGRA THAT DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SEVENTY AND THIS IS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION PARTICULARLY WITH THE WITH AB FIVE AND ALL THE ISSUES IN THE COMPLEXITIES AND THE CONFUSION SURROUNDING THE BILL. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ON ON YOUR DESK FOR MY DESK THAT THERE WOULD NUMBER OF BLACK NEWSPAPERS OPPOSED TO THIS AND THAT THEY IN DOUBLE ACP AND OTHERS HAVE TAKEN POSITIONS AGAINST AB FIVE. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION IT THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN AGREEMENT REACHED AS A RESULT OF THAT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS PULL BACK THEIR OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE BASED ON THE FACT THAT AB ONE SEVENTY WAS GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM TO GIVE THEM A ONE YEAR REPRIEVE TO GET ORGANIZED IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE LIVE UP TO THE AGREEMENTS THAT WE MAKE WITH INDIVIDUALS I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. I'VE LEARNED THAT AT THE ON THIS HOUSE ANY TIME I'VE HAD A BILL WE JUST DID THAT WITH THREE NINE TWO WHEN YOU MAKE A DEAL AND YOU MAKE AN AGREEMENT YOU'RE SUPPOSE YOU SHOULD LIVE UP TO IT AND I THINK THAT THE BLACK PRESS HAS CALLED ME SEVERAL TIMES A DAY TO MAKE SURE. THAT AB ONE SEVENTY WAS COMING TO THE FLOOR I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS FINE I DID NOT KNOW THAT THE THAT THE AUTHOR ROBERT WAS NOT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BECAUSE I WAS ON THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT AGREEMENT HAD BEEN MADE AND THAT IT WASN'T A PERFECT BILL BUT MANY OF YOU HAD ISSUES WITH THE BILL. AB FIVE AND SOLD UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THERE WAS SOME AGREEMENT SO WILL COMING FORTH PARTICULARLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE SO I STRONGLY SUGGESTED WE LIVE UP TO THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED OBVIOUSLY WITH THE PRESS FOR A. B. R. ONE SEVENTY IT'S A ONE YEAR EXTENSION IT'S NOT PERFECT GOD. I WAS NOT I WAS CONCERNED WITH THE PRESS BASICALLY RAISING A NUMBER OF ISSUES BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK ALL THOSE ISSUES WE'RE GOING TO BE TRUE IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL SO BUT BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT WAS MADE I WAS GOING TO BOTH AB FIVE ANYWAY. BUT BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT WAS MADE THAT THEY WOULD BE PROTECTED FOR ONE YEAR UNTIL THEY WORKED OUT THIS ISSUE I THOUGHT OKAY FINE THEN THEY WHAT THEY PULL BACK THEIR OPPOSITION. SEVERAL OF YOU ASKED ME ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE IN DOUBLE ACP AND I SAID I THINK THAT HAS BEEN PULLED BACK. THE BLACK PRESS IS PULL BACK THEIR OPPOSITION AND I RECOMMEND IT TO SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY BOTH AB FIVE. SO I THINK AT THIS POINT AB ONE SEVENTY IS THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO WITH A ONE YEAR EXTENSION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LIVE UP TO THE AGREEMENT. THAT THAT PRESS THINKS THAT WE MADE TO THEM. AND I'VE HAD AS A SAID SEVERAL CALLS FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE BLACK PRESS AND A HOST OF OTHERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. CONCERNING AB FIVE IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF HOW IT WAS GOING TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEM. AND THE ONE YEAR EXTENSION WOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH THE ABILITY. TO ADJUST BECAUSE MANY OF THEM BELIEVE IN MAYBE AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT TRUE. BUT IF THEY DO THAT IF. THE WAY AB FIVE WAS PUT IN PLACE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE IT WAS SMALL. NEWSPAPERS RUN BY JUST SOMETIMES THEIR FAMILIES AND IT WAS A LOT OF. COMPLICATED ISSUES ABOUT THE COURIERS AND THIS AND THAT. AND THIS GAVE THEM THE ASSURANCE THAT THEY'D HAVE A YEAR. TO RESPOND TO IT SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU BOTH AB ONE SEVENTY. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A PERFECT MEAL BUT I THINK THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT MATE. AND THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WAS GOING TO COME FORWARD. TO HANDLE THE ISSUES AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THEY HAVE. BUT AB FIVE. I HOPE THAT WE BOTH FOR AB ONE SEVENTY. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. MR HOLDEN. IF YOU LIKE TO FOLLOW DOCTOR WHETHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT MY COLLEAGUES TO BASICALLY LAID OUT THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF. THIS PARTICULAR BILL AB ONE SEVENTY I CONCUR WITH THEM AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I DON'T. THANK YOU MISTER HOLDEN. MISTER BASS THANK YOU IS BRB QUICKLY WITH THIS LATE HOUR OF I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL MY FIRST JOB WAS DID WAS A PAPER BOY AND I TURNED TO MY ONE ROUTE INTO SIX OR SEVEN ROUTES AND I WELL I HEARD THE STORY ABOUT OTHERS WHO WEREN'T ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET WITH THEIR PAPER OUT I BOUGHT MY FIRST VEHICLE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE DOTS AND PICK UP. WITH THE MONEY THAT I MADE IT SO THAT I INSTEAD OF RIDING A BIKE COULD USE A TRUCK OF FOR THAT ROUTE AND I TURNED THAT TRUCK INTO. MY VEHICLE WHICH WAS A JEEP WRANGLER WHICH WAS PRETTY FANTASTIC BUT NOT JUST THE BUYING VEHICLES IT ALSO PUT ME THROUGH COLLEGE NOT ONLY DID IT PUT ME THROUGH MY FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF COLLEGE IT PUT SOME FRIENDS OF MINE WHO. WERE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AYE AYE ALLOWED THEM TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT ROUTE AND HELP TO HELP THEM OUT AND I'LL STILL NEVER FORGET WHEN MY MOM CAME TO ME WITH TEARS IN HER EYES BECAUSE SHE WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT THAT MONTH THAT SHE HAD TO BORROW FROM HER EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SON. BECAUSE OF WHAT THAT PAPER OUT DID SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THIS EVENING KNOWING THAT ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR US OPTIONS FOR WORKERS AND FOR ME THAT PAPER OUT OF MADE A HUGE IMPACT IN MY LIFE AND TAUGHT ME THE DIGNITY OF WORK I RISE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES. SENIOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION IS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DESERT IPAD I BELIEVE IN THE YEARS PAST SINCE YOU WERE EIGHTEEN MAYBE THE FOLKS WHO HAVE TAKEN ON THOSE JOBS MIGHT CHANGE A LITTLE I ALSO HAD A PAPER ROUTE. WHEN I WAS TWELVE IT WAS AN INTERESTING WAY TO START WORK I'M I WILL SAY THIS IN IN REGARDS TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO THERE WAS A DEAL CUT APPARENTLY THE DEAL BETWEEN THE NEWSPAPERS WAS NOT A DEAL WITH ME. AND IF I HAD CUT THAT DEAL I WOULD NOT STAND UP AND SAY. I DON'T SUPPORT A BILL I'M TAKING. I WAS FORCED. TO ADD NEWSPAPERS. NEWSPAPER CARRIERS. TO A BILL IN ORDER TO BRING UP MAYBE FIVE. I WAS VERY CLEAR WITH THE FOLKS IN THE SENATE. THAT I WOULD DO THAT AND I SAID FILLED MY RESPONSIBILITY IN FACT BY NOW PRESENTING THIS FOR THE THIRD TIME. BUT I WAS ALSO VERY CLEAR THAT I PERSONALLY WOULD NOT BE VOTING FOR IT. AND THAT I WOULD EXPRESS THAT IN SO I WOULD BE. I I'M NOT ASKING ANYBODY TO NOT VOTE FOR IT I'M NOT ASKING ANYBODY TO VOTE OR SOMETHING I CAN'T VOTE FOR. SO I JUST WANT TO BE ON IS THAT WHILE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN AGREEMENT. THE NEWSPAPERS NEVER TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT AGREEMENT. OF MY GREEN MEANT WAS SIMPLY WITH THE SENATE TO BRING UP A BILL THAT I STILL BELIEVE IS A VERY BAD BILL. AND THE REASON I A I AM SO STRONGLY PERSONALLY OPPOSE QUITE FRANKLY IS BECAUSE WHEN I APPROACHED I KNOW MAX WOULD TAKE A LOT OF. CRITICISM FOR. IN THE AB FIVE. WE HAD A SPECIFIC TASK WE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW WE THOUGHT ABOUT. THE JOBS THAT SHOULD BE EXACT. FROM FROM DYNAMAX JOBS WITH HIGH BARRIER TO ENTRY. SO THAT INDIVIDUALS COULD BARGAIN FOR THEMSELVES. JOBS WHERE THAT WORKERS GETTING AT LEAST TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE. JOBS WHERE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE TO ACTUALLY GET INTO A JOB AND YOU HAVE. OUR THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS. WHEN YOU READ THE DYNAMICS DECISION IF YOU EVER HAVE. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SUPREME COURT WAS TRYING TO GUARD AGAINST THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY I WANT TO POINT OUT HAS A LONG HISTORY. A MISS CLASSIFICATION THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE FACING. WHEN THEY BROUGHT THIS OFFER TO THE SENATE THEY KNEW THE NUMBER OF LAWSUITS THAT THEY'RE FACING AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR CARRIERS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO JUST AND POWER. I'M EATING THAT'S JUST THE FACTS IN I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T STATE THEM UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T GET TO HEAR THE STORIES ABOUT THOSE DELIVERY FOLKS AND SO IT IS MY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW MY PASSION TO REPRESENT WORKERS AND I'M JUST DOING MY BEST TO MY OBLIGATION TO THE SENATE WHICH WAS TO BRING ONE SEVENTY UP.

OUR STUDENT SUCCESS DEPENDS ON I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE MISTER SPEAKER. MR MCCARTY HERE RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I KNOW THE HOUR IS LATE THE MORNING IS EARLY ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT TO SUPPORT IN THIS MEASURE WE KNOW THERE IS THE DOCUMENT IN NEED. IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM FOCUS ON OUR FACILITIES FRANKLY FUNDING OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION BUT THIS IS OF COURSE THE FACILITIES BOND. IN OUR OWN DISTRICTS WE SEE OUR HIGH SCHOOLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS. THE TRUE DOCUMENT IN NEED SO WE GET THAT. BUT I DO HAVE SOME SERIOUS MISGIVINGS ABOUT THIS FOR ONE FOR ONE MAJOR ISSUE. THERE IS. A GLARING OMISSION HERE THE IT'S SOMEWHAT IRONIC BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS THE PRE SCHOOL K. TWELVE. AND HIGHER EDUCATION BOND BUT THERE IS NO SET ASIDE. FOR PRESCHOOL. THERE IS OF COURSE A AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN ELIGIBILITY FOR THE NINE BILLION BUT SET ASIDES MATTER THAT'S WELL AS A SET ASIDE FOR YOU SEE. FOR THE COMMUNICABLE **** FOR THE CSU FOR CAREER TACK FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS AND SO FORTH SO. THERE THERE WILL BE PERMISSIVE LANGUAGE PERMISSIVE LANGUAGE WHICH IS HELPFUL BUT AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS WEEK. THERE ARE SO MANY NEEDS TODAY TO MODERNIZE OUR CLASSROOMS TO DEAL WITH THAT DID THE CURRENT NEEDS IF YOU'RE A SCHOOL BOARD YOUR YOUR POPULATION YOU SERVE. OUR STUDENTS FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY SERVING PRESCHOOL THAT'S NOT YOUR CONSTITUENCY THAT SOMETIMES UNFORTUNATELY. A LUXURY SO ONCE AGAIN. UNFORTUNATELY PRESCHOOLS GONNA GET A LEFT BEHIND WHICH IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON A SOUND INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA GOING FORWARD FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. AND WHY THIS MATTER WE YOU KNOW WE GET IT WE KNOW THAT PRESCHOOLS APPROVING DIFFERENCE MAKER. THE RESEARCH IS CLAIRE IF YOU WANT MORE KIDS IN COLLEGE AND SUCCEEDING WANT MORE KIDS GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL. READY TO BURKE COLLEGE AND CAREER WE NEED MORE KIDS IN PRESCHOOL AND WE NEED MORE CLASSROOMS AND JUST TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT TO THIS THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE STEPPED UP TO EXPAND PRESCHOOL ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EXPANDING PRESCHOOL IT'S REALLY TWO THINGS IT'S A IT'S THAT WILL ACTUALLY THREE I'M SORRY IT'S EXPANDING SLOTS. BUT IN ORDER TO FILL SLOTS TO WORK YOU NEED TWO THINGS YOU NEED ADEQUATE RATES AND YOU NEED. FACILITIES SO WE HAVE INCREASE THE RATES BUT WE'VE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAY. THEY CAN'T FILL THE SLOT BECAUSE THEY NEED FACILITIES SO IT'S LIKE A KIND OF A CATCH TWENTY TWO YEAR WHICH IS WHY THIS ISSUE. IS SO IMPORTANT SO THIS MEASURE IS. IS UNFORTUNATELY. INCOMPLETE AND I'M VERY CONFLICTED TONIGHT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CARE SO MUCH OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION CARE SO MUCH ABOUT HER SCHOOL CHILDREN BUT WE'RE NOT STANDING UP FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO EXPANDING ACCESS AND FACILITIES SO. YOU KNOW AS AS AS AS MEASURE A PASSES AND GOES BEFORE THE VOTERS IN MARCH YOU KNOW I SUPPORT ALL THESE PIECES IN THERE AND SO THAT'S WHY IT IS CONFLICTING BECAUSE I REALIZE THERE IS SO MUCH POSITIVE HERE BUT WE DO HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS WHEN IT COMES TO FACILITIES FOR PUBLIC PRESCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA AT OUR L. AT R. ELLIE ACE. I AM PLEASED WITH THE TALKS THAT WE'VE HAD ALL DAY TODAY AND ALL WEEK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHERE MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE FROM OUR BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION FROM COLTON IS GOING TO OUTLINE A FEW MOMENTS AND I'M CERTAIN THAT WOULD LEADERSHIP OF OUR SPEAKER. AND WITH OUR BUDGET SHARE AND I KNOW ALL BE WORKING AS CHAIR THE BUDGET SUB TO COMMITTEE THAT WILL MAKE A PRIORITY OF ONE TIME INVESTMENTS FIRST PRE SCHOOL FACILITIES AS WE RECONVENE IN JANUARY AND TALK ABOUT OUR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THEY REST REGARDING MS RACE. YEAH DON'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE. MR DOLLAR YOU CAN ADDRESS ISSUES IN YOUR CLOTHES MITHRAS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I WANT TO THANK BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT WAS PUT INTO THIS. THERE'S GREAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A MISNOMER AS WAS NOTED EARLIER. THIS IS AN EDUCATION BOND. THAT IS CALLED PRE K. K. THROUGH TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION. YET THERE WAS NO MONEY SET ASIDE FOR PRE K. THERE'S PROGRESSIVE YEARS FOR PRE K. BUT THERE WAS NO MONEY SET ASIDE FOR PRE K. I WANT TO THANK. THE FORTY THREE FORTY FOUR FORTY THREE MEMBERS WHO AGREED. THAT PRE K. NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED. AND THERE HAD TO BE FUNDING FOR FACILITIES FOR PRE K. BECAUSE IT YOU GAVE US THE POWER. AND YOU GAVE US THE INSTRUCTION TO ENGAGE WITH THE GROUP WITH THE GOVERNOR. TO KNOW WHAT WE HAD FOR THE FUTURE. I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE ON THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR SPENDING THE TIME. THE HOURS TO DISCUSS HOW WE CAN BEST. DEAL WITH THIS IN THE FUTURE. I WANT TO SHARE THE LANGUAGE THE WE HAVE AGREED UPON. PRE K. AND FUNDING PRE SCHOOL FACILITIES ARE SHARED HI PRIORITIES OF THE GOVERNOR. THE SPEAKER AND THE LEGISLATURE. WITH THE GOVERNOR WE HAVE A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM HIM TO ADDRESS THESE PRIORITIES AND TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET. THERE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AFFORD. WE ALSO AGREE THAT FUNDING FACILITIES AND WORK FORCE NEEDS ARE A PRECONDITION OF UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. MEMBERS WITH THE LEVEL OF THE GOVERNOR'S DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AND WITH A COMMITMENT FROM OUR SPEAKER WHO HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD. EDUCATION. I THINK WE CAN SAFELY EXPECT THAT THE GOVERNOR. WILL LEAD THE EFFORT TO FUND THE PRE SCHOOL FACILITIES THAT ARE MISSING FROM THIS PARTICULAR BOND. THANK YOU. MR OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB FORTY EIGHT THIS MEASURE WOULD AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS TO FUND SCHOOL FACILITY% CONSTRUCTION I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF SCHOOL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THE STATE SHOULD FUNDED. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH FIFTEEN BILLION AS I DON'T THINK IT'S HIGH ENOUGH I WHICH WAS MORE BUT MY PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS THIS. WE'RE ISSUING FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS IN A YEAR WHEN WE HAVE A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS. TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT IT'S LIKE A FAMILY HAS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK THEY WANT TO TAKE A THOUSAND DOLLAR VACATION BUT INSTEAD OF USING THE MONEY THAT THEY PUT IN THE BANK. THEY CHARGE THE VACATION ON THEIR HIGH INTEREST CREDIT CARD THAT MAKES NO SENSE. CURRENTLY THE STATE HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF LONG TERM BOND DEBT. SO BY AUTHORIZING THIS WE'RE GOING TO ADD ABOUT TEN PERCENT. DOOR STATES OVERALL DEBT AT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. NOW THAT IS IN A YEAR. WHEN DEBT SERVICE IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING OBLIGATIONS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR. ECONOMIC TIMES HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY GOOD SO THAT'S THE LAST THING THAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD IS TO ADD TO THE DEBT IN FACT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS THE OPPOSITE WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD YOU WANT TO PAY DOWN. THAT LONG TERM DEBT. PUT LESS COST PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND LEADER IN YEARS WHEN TIMES ARE NOT SO GOOD. AND I THINK THE WORST PROBLEM WITH THIS MEASURE IS THIS WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE BORROW MONEY. WE FINANCE A BOND OVER TWENTY YEARS IT ACTUALLY COSTS US TWO DOLLARS TO PAY BACK THAT MONEY FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE BORROWED. SO TO PUT THAT A DIFFERENT WAY IF WE INSTEAD DECIDED TODAY. WE WERE GOING TO TAKE THAT ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS GOING TO A YEAR THAT IS GOING TO TAKE TO SERVICE THAT BOND. OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS AND SPEND THAT MONEY. ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES WE COULD BUILD TWICE AS MANY SCHOOLS TWICE AS MANY PRESCHOOLS TWICE AS MANY COLLEGES. THAT'S A MUCH BETTER WAY OF GOING ABOUT THIS THAN TO PUT THE STATE FURTHER IN DEBT I ORIGINAL VOTE. MR STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER A MEMBERS. THIS HOUSE HAS HAD A LONG STANDING COMMITMENT TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THIS GOVERNOR CAMPAIGNED ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND I KNOW THAT PRESCHOOL IS PERMISSIVE IN THIS BONDS. BUT RECOGNIZE WE HAVE STARVED SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR YEARS. OF FACILITIES MONEY AND THEY HAVE LOTS OF NEEDS OF THOSE NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE MET FIRST ANY SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WILL TELL YOU THAT. PLUS WE HAVE NOT FUNDED THE RATES FOR PRESCHOOL AT LEVELS THAT ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO REALLY BE ABLE TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS AT LEVELS THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO. SO WITHOUT THE RATES WITHOUT THE MONEY GOING IN AND WITH THE HIGH FACILITIES NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL BE APPLYING FOR THIS MONEY FOR PRESCHOOL. SO IF WE PUT IT IN THERE. AS PERMISSIVE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT EFFECT. IF WE CAN PUT SOME MONEY SET ASIDE SPECIFIC FOR PRESCHOOL THAT SHOULD HOPEFULLY IF WE CAN ALSO ADDRESS THE RATES ISSUE. SIGNAL THAT WE'RE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT DOING PRESCHOOL. SO I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS LOVE THE MONEY FOR HIGHER AT. LOVE MONEY FINALLY FOR THAT K. FOURTEEN SYSTEM. BUT IF WERE SERIOUS ABOUT PRESCHOOL WE HAVE TO NOW WE HAVE THE HOUSE IF THIS BILL PASSES. AND WE PUT THIS ONE MEASURE FORWARD IS GOING TO BE INCUMBENT ON US TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BUDGET PRIORITIES REFLECT. OUR RHETORIC AND WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO PRESCHOOL. THE GOVERNOR HAS GIVEN US. REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN THE SHADOW OF A COMMITMENT SO THROUGH THIS FALL AND IN OUR BUDGET CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT CLEAR. ON OUR BEHALF AND ON THE GOVERNOR'S WE HAVE AND WITH THE SENATE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE WE REALLY MOVE TOWARDS EVERY WHAT EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT IS UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL BUT PUTTING THE RATES IN PLACE AND PUTTING THE FACILITIES IN PLACE. THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THIS HAPPENS. MR MEDINA YOUR RECORD THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE WE'VE HAD A HIGHER EDUCATION BOND ON THE BALLOT IT'S PAST TIME THAT WE HAVE A EDUCATION BOND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. FORTY EIGHT.

IT INCLUDES FUNDS DIRECTLY TO SCHOOLS FOR NEEDED FACILITIES AND ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS THAT ARE SMALLER HAVE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL THERE'S A FOCUS ON FUNDING FOR SAFETY FOR SAFETY PROJECTS LIKE FIRE EARTHQUAKE AND MAINTENANCE WITH INCENTIVES FOR INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE ATTENTION TO AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOW TO HOUSING AND AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY.
