FOR THE LIVE DRIVERS WHO CAME I FEEL SO BAD WHEN DROPPED WHEN WORKERS COME IN THEY'VE BEEN TOLD SOMETHING BY THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF AMENDED. AND THEY WANT. I'LL SAY THIS I'D BE HAPPY TO ADD INTO THIS BILL THE LAW AS IT IS TODAY AND THAT IS THAT IT IS THE EMPLOYER WHO PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY. ALL THE TIME WE HEARD FROM STAFFING COMPANIES. LEFT AND UBER TODAY DECIDE. WHETHER OR NOT THESE WORKERS ARE FLEXIBLE WILL DECIDE TOMORROW I'LL DECIDE IF THEIR EMPLOYEES. THAT IS IN THEIR HANDS IT IS NOT ANYTHING IN THE LAW THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T BE A PART TIME WORKER YOU CAN'T WORK FIVE HOURS A WEEK ARE YOU CAN'T WORK. TWO HOURS HERE IN THREE HOURS THERE THERE IS NOTHING IN OUR LABEL THAT'S A JUST AND BE HAPPY TO PUT THAT IN HERE. I THINK THE WORKERS IN THIS INDUSTRY SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT. AND AND HE EMPLOYERS IN THIS INDUSTRY AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE THE EMPLOYERS SHOULD UNDERSTAND. THAT ANY COMPROMISE COULD NOT COME AT AT THE COST OF THE WORK. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M REFUSING TO DOING THIS I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND ALL CONTINUE TO TALK I'VE COME UP WITH LIKE FIVE WAYS THEY COULD. WORK THROUGH THIS YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE AN APP IT'S A STAFFING HALL WITH ALL THESE DRIVERS WHO ARE EMPLOYEES OF THE OF THIS NEW. STAFFING AGENCY I I WOULD GET A YOU KNOW IF I COULD CREATE AN APP I WOULD. YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN ALLOW THEM TO BE EMPLOYEES AND GIVE THEM CARD CHECK NEUTRALITY AND ALLOW THEM TO ORGANIZE WITHOUT INTERFERENCE AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A REAL. A REAL CONVERSATION WITH THE WORKERS WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY UNIONS THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR THEM. WE CAN ALL BE INNOVATIVE. LET'S START WITH PROTECTING WORKERS AND PROTECTING TAXPAYERS BY DOING IT SO WITH THAT I'LL. BE SAID LAST NIGHT. THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES SENATOR JANET IF I MAY UM AND I APOLOGIZE TO ME AGAIN TOO MANY THINGS GOING ON THE GREED THAT WE'VE SEEN I THINK HAS SO DISTORTED OUR REALITY. ON THAT. AT THE SAME TIME. PART OF WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA'S SO GREAT IS OUR ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND OUR CREATIVITY AND OUR INNOVATION. SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE SAID BUT I THINK WE ALSO. IF THERE'S WE GOTTA FIND THAT BALANCE AND IT'S NOT REALLY THE SMALLER BUSINESSES THAT ARE MOM AND POP AND MAYBE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE THAT COME IN ON A YOU KNOW PART TIME BASIS WHEN THEY NEED A LITTLE EXTRA HELP. IT'S THESE BIG GUYS WHO FIGHT THAT THE BATTLE NOW IS HOW. HOW YOUNG CAN I BE TO BECOME A BILLIONAIRE? I MEAN IT'S THE WHOLE WE'VE SKEWED -- OUR SENSE OF PRIORITIES AND VALUES IN THIS COUNTRY AND AND I THINK THE WORKERS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE THERE. THERE'S A WAY YOU KNOW I THINK OF IN THE FIFTIES AND IN THE SIXTIES WHEN WE REBUILD THIS COUNTRY AFTER WORLD WAR. TWO THE TAX RATE FOR THE HIGHEST INCOME PEOPLE. WAS 90%. AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY. AFTER HE WAS TWO MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS NOT CHICKEN FEED. YES THE PEOPLE WHO MADE MORE WE'RE TAX THAT 90%. NOBODY WANTS TO PAY 90% THEIR MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT SO WHAT DID THEY DO THEY REINVESTED IN THEIR BUSINESSES AND IN THEIR PEOPLE AND THEY CREATED LOYALTY AND THEY CREATED. A FISSION SEASON COMPETENCIES AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE. BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO PUT A CEILING ON PEOPLE'S INNOVATION. AND YOU KNOW I THINK OF SOME OF MY FISH FROM. YOU KNOW THEY GOT A BOAT. AND THEY WANT TO GO OUT AND IT'S THAT THERE ARE FISH OUT THERE AND GRAB A COUPLE PEOPLE OFTEN. WHO ARE YOU KNOW K&lt;c.cyan&gt; LOOKING&lt;/c&gt; FOR WORK AND THEY GO OUT FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS TO COME BACK WITH A BUNCH OF FISH? AND THIS GUY GETS 15% THIS GUY GETS. YOU KNOW. IF WE SAY THEM YOU GOTTA PAY FOR THE TIME THEY SLEEP ON THE BOND THE TIME THEY DO THIS. AT THE MOST THESE GUYS HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THEIR FISHERMEN THEY'RE NOT BUSINESS PEOPLE SO I THINK OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT. AND AND PEOPLE WHO CAME UP AND SAID SUPPORT UNLESS AMENDED. WELL THEY WANTED EXEMPTION. BUT I DON'T THINK THE WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS AND YOU KNOW THIS BETTER NOW AND I HAVE TO COMMEND YOU FOR TAKING ON THIS PUPPY THIS IS NOT A NATION -- ONE IS TO SOME CRITERIA RATHER CHOOSE WHO WE'RE GOING TO EXEMPT THIS GROUP AND WE ONE EXCEPT THIS ONE THIS ONE WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF STANDARDS THAT ARE BOTH. IT SEEMS TO ME BOTH REFLECTIVE OF THIS NEWER ECONOMY AND YET IS THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY AND THAT WILL KEEP THIS COUNTRY GOING. BECAUSE IF WE LOSE THAT MIDDLE CLASS WE ARE IN BIG TROUBLE AND WE SEE THAT HAPPENING ON A DAILY BASIS SO. AGAIN -- I URGE YOU TO KEEP GOING I THINK THIS IS IN ORDER. DIRECTION I'M GONNA RESERVE MY RIGHT IF THE AS THIS THING COMES FORWARD BECAUSE YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE REALLY NEED TO CELEBRATE INNOVATION AS WELL. AND I THINK OF SOME OF THESE PLATFORMS I WAS HEARING ABOUT THEM OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. WHAT IS IT LIKE RABBIT TO AND AND -- AND THESE OTHER YOU KNOW THEIR PLATFORMS YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES. THERE THE YELLOW PAGES ON A PLATFORM SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S OF GREAT NEW IDEA PER SE WE USED TO WANT TO FIND A PLUMBER YOU GO TO THE YELLOW PAGES. I'M NOW YOU CAN GO TO THESE VARIOUS PLATFORMS WHICH I THINK IS GREAT BUT THE QUESTION IS. ARE WE ARE WE GOING TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION. ARE WE GOING TO ENCOURAGE GREED. ARE WE GOING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THEM AND RESPECT THEM AND REALIZE THEY HAVE FAMILIES AND THEY NEED. TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO YOU KNOW WE WERE OFFER PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY SO LET'S FIND A WAY THAT WE HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY AT THE SAME TIME WE RESPECT. WORKERS AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW WE GET THERE BUT I COMMEND YOU FOR TRYING AND AGAIN -- JT OPPORTUNITY SHARE MY THOUGHTS BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS REALLY. SORT OF AN EXISTENTIAL MOMENT FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AND AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING MEANINGFUL FOR EVERYBODY SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL THANK YOU SENATOR TO ACTUALLY HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR PAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR HILL BY HILL AYE MORRELL. MORRELL NO JACKSON. JACK. JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. PAN HI CAN I THREE VOTES WILL HOLD THE ROLL OVER FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO MOVE NOT ITEM NUMBER THREE AB ONE SEVENTY ONE HOPEFULLY A LITTLE LESS. THIS IS JUST AN EASY ONE A GOOD ONE ALL THEY'RE ALL GONE. AB ONE SEVENTY ONE OF THE BILL FROM LAST YEAR THEY RE INTRODUCED BECAUSE VULNERABLE LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE STILL TOO OFTEN LEFT BEHIND IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PROTECTING WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE. BASICALLY THIS BILL CAME ALONG BECAUSE WHEN WE DID A LISTENING FOR OF WORKERS WE FOUND OUT THAT% A LOT OF WOMEN -- IN PARTICULAR IN SERVICE INDUSTRY AT WE'RE HAVING EXPERIENCE OF NOT WANTING TO FILE A LAWSUIT BUT SIMPLY GOING TO THE SUPERVISOR TO REPORT. I ACTIONS THAT WERE HAPPENING AND I I'LL USE THIS IS WHAT WE HEARD BUT IT WAS THE AS THE COOK CAM CHAIN THE WAITRESSES BACKED. AND THE WAITRESS WOULD GO TO OUR SUPERVISOR AND SAID I JUST WANT THIS TO STOP WELL RATHER THAN -- THEN IT SHOULD NOT FILING A LAWSUIT SO SHE HAS NO IF YOU HAVE PROTECTIONS THE SHE WOULD GET HER SCHEDULE CHANGE SHOULD GET FIRED -- AND THAT'S HOW IT WOULD STOP AND SO THIS WOULD JUST BE A PRESUMPTION OF RETALIATION IF AFTER DOING THAT% SIMPLE REPORTING -- I HEARD HER JOB CHANGED OUR FOR HIS BUT IT'S LARGELY HER -- IT'S A WAY TO PROTECT LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO ARE NEVER GOING TO SUE UNDER FEE HEN DON'T HAVE THE SIMPLE PROTECTIONS BUT DON'T WANT TO BE MESSED WITH ON THE JOB. THE BILL THANK YOU A GOOD WITNESSES SUPPORT MISTER TURN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HERE IN SUPPORT I WOULD JUST NOTE THIS IS A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION WE FEEL THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE A MUCH GREATER ABILITY. TO READ BUT A PRESUMPTION THAN A LOW WAGE WORKER DOES TO TRY TO MEET THE BURDEN OF PROOF ESPECIALLY WHEN MOST WORKERS CAN BE FIRED AT WILL SO ALL THE EMPLOYER HAS TO SAY IS I FIRED HER BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT. AND TO GET OUT OF IT BEING RETALIATORY HERE IF THERE'S A LEGITIMATE REASON IT IT JUST COINCIDENCE THAT SHE FELT THAT SHE REPORTED SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT THERE IS A LEGITIMATE REASON THE EMPLOYER SOMETHING HAS TO MAKE THAT CASE. WE THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT BALANCE TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN ARE ABLE TO COME WOMEN AND MEN ARE ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND IN DOING SO NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE THE CHANCE OF GETTING JUSTICE. BUT THEY ARE ALSO ABLE TO PROTECT THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] MR BROAD. REMEMBER. THERE'S ANY NIGHT HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. TAKE A BREAK OR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORK CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. FOR THANK YOU. GESTURE ON THE CW A SEND YOU CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY GOOD OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANYONE HERE IN SUPPORT. THOSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD THANK. I KNOW YOU. AFTER THE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU I'M ABOUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. I'LL BE BRIEF YOU'VE HAD A LONG MORNING THEN A LONG EVENING. LAST NIGHT. WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T CONDONE RETALIATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE APPROACH TAKEN BY THIS BILL. WE HAVE A THRESHOLD CONCERN WITH STATUTORY REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION SWITCH WE'VE TRADITIONALLY OPPOSED -- OUR FUDAMENTAL ISSUE WHEN I WANT TO FOCUS MY ATTENTION ON IS. IN OF A NEW BODY OF LAW RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION. IN THE LABOR CODE S OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE WHERE FAIR THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROTECTIONS CURRENTLY RESIDE. WE THINK IT'S CONFUSING WHEN YOU HAVE A NEW BODY OF LAW IN THE LABOR CODE AND A DIFFERENT AGENCY ENFORCING THAT BODY OF LAW. AND CAME RESULT IN SOMETHING CONSISTENT INTERPRETATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT DOES. NOT COVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION AND PROVIDE WORKERS WITH REMEDIES AND WE THINK THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THESE. TO BE WE THINK THE GOVERNOR AND HIS VETO MESSAG SB THIRTY EIGHTY ONE LAST YEAR RAISE THIS IS A CONCERN. THEY WERE SIMILARLY DIFFERENT LEISLATION AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE SIXTY NINE WHICH TRIED TO ADD DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION PROJECTS TO LABOR CODE. GOVERNOR BROWN VETO THAT BILL AND SAID EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION SHOULD. RESIDE IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. SO WE HAVE CONCERNS BASED ON THE PLACEMENT OF THE LANGUAGE. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU ADDED TO THE LABOR CODE IT IMPLICATES PAGA. AND SO ON TOP OF THE FEE HAVE REMEDIES IN THE REMEDIES IN THE LABOR COULD THAT THIS BILL WOULD CREATE. WOULD ALSO -- PAGA VIOLATIONS FOR THIS. FOR THOSE REASONS WERE WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YES SOUNDS GOOD TO ME -- I APPRECIATE THIS YOU KNOW. THIS KIND OF MISBEHAVIOR GOES ON AND IN THE WORKPLACE. IN SUCH STAGGERING. OF PERCENTAGES THAT -- SHADE THE THE IDEA THAT THIS DOES CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION UNLIKE THE CHAMBER I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA IT. FORCES YOU TO COME FORWARD AND IT FORCES EMPLOYERS HOPEFULLY WILL ENFORCE. A FORTUNE PORTION THINK TWICE ABOUT THIS IT JUST ISN'T ACCEPTABLE IT'S NOT WORK RELATED IT'S DEMEANING IT'S DEGRADING AND HUMILIATING TO THE WORKERS. IT ACTUALLY IMPACTS THEIR ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB. SO I WOULD THINK MOST EMPLOYERS WOULD WOULD WANT TO PROTECT THEIR WORKERS IN THE WORKFORCE BUT IT'S A CULTURE SHIFT. OTHER JUST HASN'T HAPPENED JUST BECAUSE IT'S IT IS LOGICAL AND MAKES SENSE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THE BILL ALL MOVE IT -- AND AWHILE I GUESS ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THE WORST THE RIGHT PLACE TO PUT IT AND ALL -- I DO THINK THAT THIS. THIS IS A STEP FORWARD AS WE KEEP READING ABOUT THE JEFF. PEELING BACK A CURTAIN NOW THAT MANY OF US. HAVE KNOWN AS SIX IT HAS EXISTED. FOR DECADES TO AND THIS I THINK IS GOOD BILL AND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUING IN THIS AREA I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WORKPLACE NEEDS TO BE SAFE FOR EVERYBODY AND I DO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL TAKE THAT MOTION IS SECONDS ONE TO CLARIFY THAT THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WILL BE. FORCED OUT IN IN APPROACH SHOULD TAKE THAT. THERE. GIVEN ME YET YES THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE FOR THE DISCUSSION TO NOW WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR JACKSON WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE BY THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE I REMEMBER THREE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. SENATOR HILL I I BROWN. JACKSON AYE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. TO VOTE WILL CALL THE ROLL OPEN THANK YOU MOVED ITEM FOR AB. TEN SIXTY SIX ABC THANK YOU AB TEN SIXTY SIX IS NOT A NEW IDEA SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY EXIST IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT -- WORKERS WHO ARE LOCKED OUT OR ON STRIKE CAN ACCESS UNEMPLOYMENT. INSURANCE BENEFITS IT WOULD APPLY TO LOCKED OUT WORKERS AFTER WEEK LIKE ANY OTHER WORKER -- WE WE SAW DURING THE GROCERY WORKERS STRIKE YEARS AGO -- THAT THAT BECAME A PROBLEM IN IT WOULD ALLOW STRIKING WORKERS AFTER FOUR WEEKS OF BEING ON STRIKE IN IN RECEIVING NO FUNDS TO ACCESS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS -- DISTRICTS ARE EXTREMELY RARE I IN OFTEN WHEN YOU GET TO A FOUR WEEK STRIKE THE EMPLOYER HAS AGES BALANCE OF POWER IN IS ENCOURAGED ACTUALLY. JUST KEEP WORKERS OUT SO THAT THEY WILL AGREE TO LESS MONEY BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN OUT FOR SO LONG PEOPLE OFTEN LOSE THEIR HOUSES AND OTHER THINGS. I DON'T CLAIM INSURANCE IS NOT INCENTIVE TO STRIKE IT'S BASICALLY HALF FOR OF YOUR INCOME OR BORN IN FIFTY DOLLARS WHICHEVER IS LESS. NOT ENOUGH TO LIVE IN BUT IT'S ENOUGH SOMETIMES TO NOT LOSE YOUR HOUSE AND NOT LOSE YOUR LIVELIHOOD SO WITHOUT A RESPECT LAST NIGHT ABOUT -- THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT GOOD MORNING. MY NAME'S DIANE HACKER AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE F. C. W. FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT IN CLAREMONT CALIFORNIA. I'M A FRONT END MANAGER FOR MONTHS AND I'VE BEEN WITH BONDS FOR FORTY TWO YEARS. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU FIRST HAND ABOUT BEING A STRIKING WORKER AND A PICKET CAPTAIN DURING THE DEVASTATING STRIKE A MOCK OUT OF THREE A NO. FOUR WHEN WE WALKED IN THE COLD AND THE RAIN AND EVEN DURING A FOREST FIRE TO STAND UP FOR WORKPLACE JUSTICE THREE DESERVED. WE WERE LOCKED OUT -- ON STRIKE DURING HOLIDAYS WE RELIED ON FOOD BANKS IN CHURCHES TO PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLES ON A DAILY BASIS. MY FELLOW BONTA EMPLOYEES AND I WERE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FIGHTING FOR JOBS AND PROVIDING FOR FAMILIES. WORKERS AT RALPH AN ALBERTSON'S DIDN'T GET A CHOICE WORKERS CAME TO WORK THEY WERE READY TO WORK. THEY WERE ABLE TO WORK BUT THEIR CORPORATE EMPLOYERS CHOSE TO LOCK THEM OUT INSTEAD. GROCERY WORKERS LOST THEIR HOMES THEY WORK THEIR WHOLE LIVES. FOR WORKERS COULD HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK IF I WON THE EMPLOYERS HAD CONTINUE TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH. ONE COUPLE WHO WORKED WITH ME FOR FUNDS HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE NECESSARY MEDICAL TREATMENTS FOR THEIR DISABLED DAUGHTER WHEN OUR HEALTH INSURANCE RAN OUT. TREATMENTS THAT SHE COULD NOT DO WITHOUT. STRIKING IS ALWAYS A LAST RESORT FOR WORK STANDING UP FOR FAIR TREATMENT AND SAFE WORKPLACE CONDITIONS. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DON'T REPLACE THE PAYCHECK BUT THEY WILL HELP KEEP OUR HEADS TO FLOAT WHEN ONE MISSED PAYCHECK TO DROWNED US. THE GROCERY STORES KNOW THAT IF THEY HOLD WITHOUT LONG ENOUGH WE WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO THEIR DEMANDS IN ORDER TO FEED OUR FAMILIES AND KEEP A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS. WHEN WORKERS ARE ALREADY LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK  MONTH LONG STRIKE TO DEVASTATE A FAMILY AND THAT'S WHAT THE CORPORATE BOSSES ARE COUNTING ON? UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN WORKERS AND THEIR EMPLOYERS GIVING US THE ABILITY TO FIGHT FOR THE BASIC DIGNITY OF FAIR WAGES AND HEALTH COVERAGE. WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT COMING HOMELESS NO ONE SHOULD BE TREATED WITH THE COLD HEARTLESS DISRESPECT THAT WE SAW DURING THE WINTER OF THREE AND FOR PLEASE SUPPORT AB. TEN SIXTY SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THIS AFTERNOON OTHERS IN SUPPORT. AFTERNOON. HELLO THERE GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIRMAN L. HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE YOU GUYS HAVE IN THIS YEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS JUST YOUR HONOR I WORK FOR EIGHTEEN T. FOR ALMOST GOING ON TWENTY YEARS -- MEMBER OF CW A UNION -- NINETY LOCAL NINE FIVE ONE IN THE SAN DIEGO. AND JUST WANTED TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW. WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING C. W. MEMBERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. IF YOU LIVE WORK DUE TO A TRADE DISPUTE. THIS END OF THE BUILDING CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYERS TO DELAY NEGOTIATIONS. I PUT FORWARD ON REASONABLE TERMS. THE LONGER THE DISPUTE THE RARE CHANCE TO WORKERS OWN FINANCIAL HARDSHIP WILL PERSON BACK TO WORK. AB TEN SIXTY SIX TO RESTORE ELIGIBILITY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO STRIKING WORKERS. AFTER FOUR WEEKS OF PAST. THIS BILL WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH OTHER STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK. THAT OFFERS THAT OFFER SIMILAR BENEFITS THE STRIKING WORKERS. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS ONLY COVER A FRACTION OF THE WORKER'S PAYCHECK. THESE MODEST PAYMENTS TO HELP WORKERS MAKE ENDS MEET AS BARGAIN THIS PROBLEM. BY REMOVING THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTREME FINANCIAL HARDSHIP DURING A TRADE DISPUTE. AB TEN SIXTY SIX WILL CREATE A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. MANY OF OUR SHE TO BE MEMBERS HAVE WORKED FOR THEIR COMPANIES FOR YEARS AND DESERVE ACCESS TO THESE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COMPANIES ARE PURPOSELY DELAYING NEGOTIATION. WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING FOR THE ABILITY TO FIGHT FOR OUR RIGHTS. WITHOUT HAVING TO COMPROMISE ON ESSENTIALS LIKE RENT AND FOOD. THIS BILL IS CRUCIAL TO MAKING SURE WE ARE TREATED FAIRLY ON BOTH SIDES. ARE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION HIRED YOU GUYS -- FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR COMING TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MUCH TIGHTER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL ALONG WITH CW AND UFCW. FALL REASON STATED SO WELL BY THE AUTHOR AND PREVIOUS WITNESSES. JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY COVER WHAT THE BILL DOESN'T DO -- WE REALLY DON'T THINK THE BILL IN ANYWAY FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERS THE U. I. SYSTEM ALL IT DOES IS BETTER ALIGNED THE INTENT OF THE U. I. SYSTEM. WITH THE WAY THAT IT WORKS OUT IN PRACTICE WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT JUST INDIVIDUAL WORKERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS BUT ALSO THAT. THERE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES -- ALSO DON'T SUFFER THE IMPACT OF ESPECIALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOB AT ONCE AND THAT'S WHY THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN UPHELD BY COURTS IN OTHER STATES. IT ALSO DOESN'T CREATE ANY KIND OF AN INCENTIVE TO STRIKE OUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WITH THE WAY THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WORK IN PRACTICE IT STARTS WITH THAT MONTH DISQUALIFICATION THAT'S A MONTH WITH NO WAGES. AND THEN THE BENEFITS THAT STAR AFTER THAT THERE ARE SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY ON AVERAGE YOU AYE BENEFITS ARE ABOUT 26% OF WHAT YOU WERE EARNING AND SO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SYSTEM WHERE YOU ARE NOTHING FOR A MONTH AND THEN A QUARTER OF WHAT YOU WERE EARNING ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER REASONS WHY WORKERS DON'T WANT TO GO ON STRIKE IT'S A GRUELING DEVASTATING EXPERIENCES A LOT OF TIME ON A PICKET LINE IT'S A LOT. OF ORGANIZING IN DAYCARE AND IT'S NOT FUN AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS A DECISION THAT WORKERS MAKE LIGHTLY SO WHEN YOU ADD THAT ON TOP OF THE VERY LOW BENEFITS AND THE MONTH DISQUALIFICATION THERE'S REALLY NOTHING HERE THAT'S GOING TO CREATE AN INCENTIVE TO STRIKE AND THAT'S WHY. ET DE ESTIMATES THAT THE COST OF THIS IS SO LOW AND THAT'S WHY DOESN'T CREATE ANY KIND OF A SOLVENCY RISK THE ESTIMATE IS THAT THIS WOULD ADD SOMEWHERE ON THE HIGH END OF POINT 1% OF THE COST OF THE U. I. SYSTEM TO ON THE LOW END. POINT 001% TO THE COST OF THE U. I. SYSTEM SO. IT'S NOT IN ANY WAY GOING TO DEAL WITH -- SORRY NOT ANYWAY IN A WORSE IN THE EXISTING STRUCTURAL INSOLVENCY ISSUES THAT WE'VE GOT IN THE US SYSTEM THAT. EXISTED LONG BEFORE THIS BILL THEY'LL KEEP GOING UNTIL WE DEAL WITH THOSE SEPARATELY BUT THE IMPACT OF IT IS SMALL BECAUSE THE STRIKES ARE SO RARE BUT THE IMPACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER WOULD BE GREAT IN TERMS OF ALLOWING THEM TO HELP STAY AFLOAT DURING SUCH A DEVASTATING LONG.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. T. KNOWN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD AND MAKE A LITTLE ROOM THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] YEAH -- A GOOD MORNING AFTERNOON. AFTERNOON -- CREATURE MEMBERS AND APOLOGIES -- FOR SO YOU TO BE THIS LONG TO TRY TO BE AS QUICK AS I CAN -- RUN WHICH WE CAL CHAMBER AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB. TEN SIXTY SIX FIRST I WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID I'M I'VE DISCUSSION OF WALK OUT IS MY UNDERSTANDING PRESENTLY LOCKOUTS AT THIS POINT ALREADY. THERE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AVAILABLE I'M IT'S NOT OUR INTENTION TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT OR TO TO FIGHT THAT BUT I I UNDERSTOOD THAT TO ALREADY BE THE LAW -- SO STATE EARLIER TO CLARIFY THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR OPTIONS ABOUT -- SO TRYING TO THAT. EIGHT MILLION THEY ARE OPTION IS NOT ABOUT HIS BENEFITS TO STRIKERS CHANNEL IF THE STATE WANTS TO PASS YOU KNOW EQUIVALENT OF OF WHAT IT BENEFIT PROGRAMS IT DOES NOT PUT THE BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS IN A LABOR DISPUTE. THAT WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR US YOU KNOW WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THAT OUR CONCERN IS JUST WITH THE REASON YOU WILL PAY TO HELP THEM FIND OTHER OPPORTUNITY RIGHT. AT THE SAME WAY THE EMPLOYEE UNDER CURRENT LAWS REQUIRED TO BE LOOKING FOR WORK AND ABLE TO TAKE THAT WORK I'M SO THEY CAN RECEIVE THAT TRANSITORY HELP TO HELP THEM FIND THE RIGHT SPOT RIGHT. THAT IS WHAT ON EMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN SO I'M GOING TO DISAGREE WITH THAT THIS IS A CHANGE TIME. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT AWORKER WHO IS LOOKING FOR WORK AND TRANSITION THIS IS A LABOR DISPUTE. I'M WHICH I I DON'T THINK IT'S BE A SURPRISE IT IS A PROFOUND CHANGE ONLY A FEW STATES DO THIS. NO CHANGE OUR CONCERNS ABOUT IT. FIRST WE REMAIN CONCERNED THIS. PLACE IS AN UNPREDICTABLE AND AND CONSIDERABLE RISK FOR EMPLOYERS NOW A WELL WE ARE PUSH OF THE DATA REGARDING THIS RELATIVE SHORTNESS OF STRIKES AND WE ALSO HOPE THAT STRIKES ARE BRIEF. AND RESOLVED QUICKLY IN AMICABLY ABSOLUTELY OUR CONCERN REST THAT IF A STRIKE IS NOT. INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE OR TWO OR THREE WORKERS GOING ON EMPLOYMENT A GIVEN PERIOD ALL OF A SUDDEN ROUTING HUNDREDS YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE UNION IS DOWN OF BY WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT CONCERN TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. A MACRO SENSE WELL I APPRECIATE THE POINT THAT INDIVIDUAL WORKERS IS NOT MUCH OF A PAYMENT. TO RIGHT NOW AS THE STATE'S CHOICE REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF UNEMPLOYMENT PROVIDES. I'M ON A MACRO SENSE IF YOUR EMPLOYER WITH THOUSANDS OF THOS. YEAH THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- SECONDARILY IT'S IMPORTANT OVER THIS AFFECTS EVEN PLAYERS WERE NOT HAVING LABOR DISPUTES. RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU AYE FUND IS STRUCTURED OUR CONCERN IS THAT THIS WILL RAISE THE RATES FOR EVEN EMPLOYERS WHO. HAVE NEVER HAD A LABOR DISPUTE. AND AS TO THE DATA REGARDING THE SOLVENCY OF THE U. I. FUND WE WE'RE GLAD WE WHEN WE HOPE THAT IT DOES NOT AFFECTED HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS THAT. GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S RANKING AS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PART OF LABOR RANKED CALIFORNIA'S YOU I FIND HEALTH AS LAST IN THE NATION. WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS EVEN SMALL CHANGES HERE SIGNIFICANT TO US STAYING IN THE BLACK. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POSTED AYE. IT WAS WRITTEN OFF THAT WAS VERY NICE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE -- NICOLE RICE CALIFORNIA MANY FACTORS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE TOO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND BASICALLY WE JUST HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT OF THE POLICY EXPANSION IN THIS BILL WE KNOW THAT OTHER. TO OTHER STATES HAVE ATTEMPTED THIS BUT BASED UPON WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN OUR HISTORY WITH THIS THE FACT THAT EMPLOYERS. PAY 1100% INTO THIS FINE WE JUST HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THIS POLICY EXPANSION -- WE AS IN THE MANUFACTURER'S ASSOCIATION WE HAVE LABELED THIS A MANUFACTURING BREAKER BILL BECAUSE WE WERE AT THE TABLE FOR THE NEGOTIATIONS RELATED TO OUR DEEPER SESSION A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE HAD JUST COME OUT OF THAT -- AND THERE WERE ADDS OF PREVIOUS TESTIMONY INDICATED THERE ARE STILL SOME WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RELATED TO THE SOLVENCY OF THE FUN. BUT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AGAIN AS A 1100% EMPLOYER FUNDED BENEFIT PROGRAM THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL TO REALLY ENSURE. THAT THE EMPLOYERS INVESTMENT INTO THAT FUND IS PROTECTED AND THAT THE SOLVENCY OF THE FUND IS PROTECTED SO NO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT -- WERE. CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT LABOR STRIKES ARE ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS. IT'S NOT ABOUT EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION AND THAT IS THE CRITERIA FOR THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND THAT YOU ARE PERMANENTLY SEPARATED FROM YOUR EMPLOYMENT THROUGH NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN. OTHER THINGS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL IS -- THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WHAT IS IT TERM TO ACTUALLY BE ON STRIKE IF SOMEBODY. DECIDES TO A STAND WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON STRIKE ARE DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ALSO EVEN THOUGH THEIR UNION. MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE INVOLVED IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS THEY'RE JUST A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE NOT COVERED IN THIS BILL AGAIN TO ADDRESS THE EMPLOYERS INVESTMENT INTO THIS FIGHT. I'M TO ADDITIONAL POINTS ARE -- FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST AS I SAID -- A SITUATION WHERE WE'VE HAD THE FUN COMPLETELY DEPLETED AND NEEDED TO GO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR ASSISTANCE IN ORDER TO KEEP THOSE BENEFITS FLOWING. THE SITUATION IN THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP THAT CALIFORNIA HAS AND THIS IS A REAL CONCERN FOR US IS EMPLOYERS THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP THAT CALIFORNIA HAS IF WE GOT INTO THAT SITUATION WHERE A WE WOULD NEED A FEDERAL LOAN IN ORDER TO KEEP UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS GOING TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY. NEED THEM WELL WE HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION STAYS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE RESOURCES -- AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS NOT NECESSARILY GUARANTEED THAT HAD NEEDS TO BE GRANTED THAT REQUEST NEEDS TO BE GRANTED SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. ALSO TRADITIONALLY WHEN THE POLICY MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TAKEN FROM ONE PARTICULAR RESOURCES OR POT OF RESOURCES TO PROVIDE FOR DIFFERENT -- OR EXPERIENCE FOR DIFFERENT. PURPOSES OR EXPANSION OF PURPOSES THAT. ULTIMATELY THE HEALTH OF THAT ORIGINAL FUN NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. TO LOOK AT PUTTING MORE RESOURCES FROM EMPLOYERS INTO THAT FINE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ACTIVITY AND AND THE FIVE THE LAST THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT WHILE THERE HAS BEEN A DISCUSSION ABOUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN. MANY OF THE STRIKES OCCURRING THE COMMITTEES ALL ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN UP TO UP TECH IN STRIKES AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT TYPE OF VOLUME AND AN INCREASE IN VOLUME. THEN AGAIN I THINK OUR CONCERNS AS EMPLOYERS ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE FUN AND AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT WILL HAVE ON US THE FIND. RESOURCE PROVIDERS IF YOU WILL -- BECOMES A REAL ISSUE SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL VERY GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. WE KNOW ONE THING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS. CONCERNS. SO -- THANK YOU SUMMER GONZALEZ RING THIS BILL FORD CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES FACED BY WORKERS WHO WERE YOU KNOW WHO. REALLY ARE TRYING TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS. BUT CAN YOU TURN THE OPPOSITION RAISED I MEAN THAT THE HEALTH OF THE FIVE STAR AND AND AND SO YOU KNOW DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WE HAD SOME CHALLENGES THERE -- AND SO WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT ALSO. WORKERS WHO WERE LAID OFF. DOESN'T HAPPEN BUT AND PART OF THE REASON PEOPLE ALSO. CAVS LABOR DISPUTES IS TO TRY TO PREVENT THINGS LIKE THAT FROM HAPPENING BUT ALSO IS LIKE. TO BE SURE THAT FUND IS THERE FOR THE PEOPLE ALSO WHO MAY BE EMPLOYED SO CAN GIVE ME SPEAK TO ARE THERE THINGS THAT YOU'VE LOOKED AT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROVIDE. THOSE PROTECTIONS AND THE SHIRT AT THE FUND IS THERE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. TWO YEAH THAT THAT THAT NEED IT. WELL I AM WE WORKED WITH AT FOR LAST TO BE HONEST THREE FOUR YEARS -- IN TRYING TO BRING THIS FORWARD AND AND HELD OFF UNTIL THE FUN WAS IN BETTER SHAPE I'M BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO SO FEW WORKERS -- IN SUCH RARE CIRCUMSTANCES EDT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE AN ADDITIONAL PRESSURE THE FUND THE FUND THE PROBLEMS WITH THE FUNDERS PROBLEMS WITH FIND IN AND I THINK THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. BUT THIS WOULDN'T -- HAVE THIS WOULD BE SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THAT IT WOULD THAT NOT HAVE AN ADDITIONAL -- IT'S NOT GONNA BE THE TIPPING POINT ON IT AND SO WE BROUGHT IT IN A WHEN WE WERE OUT OF KIND OF THAT SITUATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT YET THE FUND IS IN A BETTER SPOT.

AND FOR THIS WONDERFUL BILL. THIS REALLY IS A IT TURNED INTO A I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL I AM I AM EXCITED ABOUT IT AND I THINK THERE WAS A PROBLEM THAT WE NO ROOM EXISTS AND I THINK THIS THIS IS A GOOD SOLUTION TO GET TO THE HEART OF THE ME. IN THE HEART OF IT SOLVE. THANK YOU. THERE AND NUMBER [inaudible] ASSEMBLY. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE MITIGATION STRATEGIES IN PLACE WHEN A CITY COUNTY OR SPECIAL DISTRICT DIRECTS FIRE SUPPORT SERVICE EMPLOYEES TO AN INCIDENT. FIRST THE BILL REQUIRES THE CREATION OF EMERGENCY REGULATIONS FOR THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT. ON OUTDOOR FIRES AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED INSURERS FRONTLINE SUPPORT FIRE PERSONNEL RECEIVE PROPER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. AND POST FEEL DE COUNT DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES FOLLOWING A FIRE RESPONSE. THIS MEANS THE FIRE SERVICE PERSONNEL HAVE A THOROUGH AND AGGRESSIVE DECONTAMINATION STRATEGY FOLLOWING A FIRE EVENT TO CONTROL CONTAMINATION AND REMOVE HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THESE FIRE SERVICE EMPLOYEES SERVING COUNTY FIRE SERVICE OUTFITS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ARE KNOWN AS FIRE MECHANICS FIRE EQUIPMENT MECHANICS. AND OTHER MECHANIC WORKERS. THESE POPULATIONS OF WORKERS ARE SOMETIMES CALLED DIRECTLY TO THE FRONT LINES OF ACTIVE FIRES TO MAINTAIN AND REPAIR FIRE EQUIPMENT THAT IS USED BY OUR FIREFIGHTERS. THIS WAS A CASE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN RESPECTIVELY WHEN THE THOMAS AND WILL THE FIRES RAVAGED COMMUNITIES IN LA SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES. NEXT REPRESENTED BY ASKED ME SPENT OVER A WEEK ON THE FIRE LINES ALONG SIDE OUR FIREFIGHTERS WITH OUT THE SAME EQUIPMENT. THE PROTECTIVE GEAR AND CONTROLLED BREATHING APPARATUS IS MEANT TO MITIGATE FIREFIGHTERS EXPOSURE REST TO CARCINOGENS. THEY ARE VITAL TO A FIT ADD TO INCREASING EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSE TIME OF ANY FIRE FIGHTING OPERATIONS SECONDLY AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED CREATES CAL OSHA REGULATIONS THAT SET A PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LIMIT. FOR DIESEL PARTICULATE AS PER CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU KNOW FIREFIGHTERS ARE EXPOSED TO DIESEL EXHAUST BOTH IN THE STATION AS THE EQUIPMENT STARTS UP AND LEAVES AND ENTERS THE STATION. AND IN THE FIELD AS THE EQUIPMENT IS IDOLING. UNIQUE TO MANY FIREFIGHTERS IS THAT THEY BOTH WORK AND LIVE IN THE FIRE STATION SOMETIMES FOR PERIODS OF TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT HOURS LONGER. WHICH INCREASES THE POTENTIAL DURATION OF EXPOSURE OVERALL HARMFUL EFFECTS OF DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER. FINALLY THE BILL MANDATES THAT THE COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY OF LA WILL SUBMIT A STUDY ON THE EXPOSURE IN CANCER RISK A FIRE FIGHTER MECHANICS. I WILL TELL YOU THAT MY VISIT WITH LA FIRE SERVICE EMPLOYEES WHO REPAIR AND MAINTAIN. THE FIRE SERVICE VEHICLES I'M WAS [inaudible] HEART RENDERING. AND AND SO BRING TO SEE THE WORK THAT THEY DO EVERY DAY. PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. AND WATCHING THEM TELL ME THAT THE WAY THAT THEY DECONTAMINATE YOU KNOW IS BY TAKING THEIR CLOTHES ON WITH THEM AND WATCHING THEM IN THE WASHING MACHINE THE SAME WASHING MACHINE THAT THEY'RE USING TO WASH THEIR CHILDREN'S CLOTHES. I'M AND THE USING A MASK THAT ANYONE OF US CAN BUY AT HOME DEPOT OR LOWES I'M TO KEEP OUT THE PARTICULAR MATTER -- SO WITH THAT I WILL -- ALLOW GEHRY HODGES -- I FIRE EQUIPMENT MECHANIC FROM LA COUNTY -- TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. THANK YOU -- CHEERING ME FOR BEING ABLE TO HEAR. PEOPLE IN MY JOHN TODAY. WE'VE WRITTEN. WE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH FIRE DEPARTMENT TO KEEP THE FIRE APPARATUS IS SERVICE THAT'S THE HELICOPTERS FIRE TRUCKS AND EVERY APPARATUS AS PART OF THEIR OF PART OF THE PROCESS OF DOING OUR JOB. WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY EXPOSED ON A DAILY BASIS TO THE CARCINOGENS AND THE UNKNOWN MATERIAL THAT THE FIREFIGHTERS ACTUALLY. ARE PRESENTED WITH. THE ISSUE THAT WE COME ACROSS IS THOUGH THAT WHEN A FIRE. ONE FIREFIGHTER GOES TO A AND AN INCIDENT THEY HAVE THEIR PROCESS WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THAT WANT ONE CARCINOGEN OR THAT EXPOSURE LIMIT. WHEN WE SEE THE APPARATUS EVEN IF THE FIRE SHOP THAT? FIRE APPARATUS MIGHT BE OUT ON FIFTY DIFFERENT FIRES SO THERE'S A LAYER OF DIFFERENT EXPOSED -- KRISTIN ENGINES THAT WERE EXPOSED TO ON A DAILY BASIS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY PREVENTIVE MEASURE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE -- ONE NINETEEN DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE THE SELLING ARMS WORK HEARING OUR VOICE AND THIS COMMITTEE AND SUPPORTING LEGISLATION THAT WILL COME OUT AND CREATE A STANDARD. THAT WAY CAL OSHA CAN BE INVOLVED THAT THERE BE SOME KIND OF PRESIDENT THAT WOULD BE SET FORTH. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MITIGATE SOME OF THESE EXPOSURES I WITH THE PEOPLE IN OUR A BARGAINING UNIT ARE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT UNIONIZED. WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO BE. REJECTED. ULTIMATELY WE DO NOT WANT ANYONE TO COME DOWN WITH CANCER THAT'S THE WHOLE PREMISE BEHIND THAT. BY AND WE JUST ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE FACT THAT YOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY HEARING US IN TAKING OF OUR COSTS [inaudible] THANK YOU.

FOURTEEN HUNDRED AS OUTLINED BY THE THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN AS WELL AS MISTER HAJJ REFLECTS THE PROGRESS IS MADE. BY THIS LEGISLATION THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION A FORMAL LETTER SLATER'S ABOUT THE HAZARDOUS WORKING CONDITIONS THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE GOING THROUGH IN THESE SITUATIONS -- THESE OFTEN OVERLOOK CIVILIAN FAR MECHANIC SUPPORT OUR FIREFIGHTERS THIS BEEN SAID -- WITH DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITY GETTING BIGGER AND DEADLIER EVERY EVERY YEAR -- WE THINK THIS REPRESENTS A RESPONSIBLE COMMITMENT TO PROACTIVELY MITIGATING EXPOSURE TO THE WHAT WE KNOW ARE KNOWN CARCINOGENS -- THEN CARCINOGENIC MATERIAL RESULTING FROM FIREFIGHTING OPERATIONS THAT GETS ON THE MATERIAL ON THE VEHICLES THAT ARE FIREFIGHTERS USE. AND ARE LEFT -- FOR OUR FARM MECHANICS AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO TO HANDLE -- AS MENTIONED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN ON JULY SECOND -- TAKE -- SOME VERY CRITICAL STEPS IN MOVING FORWARD IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS GOAL THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS A CRITICAL -- BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TO ENSURE THE MECHANICS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING. AND REPAIRING FIREFIGHTERS FIREFIGHTING EQUIPMENT OF VEHICLES -- EITHER AT AN ACT THE FAR SIDE OR IN THEIR REPAIR STATIONS RECEIVE. APPROPRIATE IN SAFETY. AFFECT THE SAFETY EQUIPMENT -- SECONDLY THE PERMIT REGULATIONS THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADOPT BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WELL TAKEN PER -- PORTS THAT WE BELIEVE AND ENSURING THAT THE REPAIR STATIONS THAT THESE WORKERS MOVE FORTY PLUS HOURS A WEEK AND ARE SAFE. MORE HOSPITAL WORKING MORE HOSPITABLE WORKING ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE WORKERS -- AND WE BELIEVE THAT INCLUDES THE FOR THE PROPER EQUIPMENT THINGS LIKE -- PROCEDURES AND EQUIPMENT TO EVACUATE KNOWN CARCINOGENS LIKE DIESEL EXHAUST ARE THE PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LIMIT THIS MENTION OF THESE ARE CRITICAL STEPS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ALSO. WHAT WE ARE MOVING THIS CONSISTENT WITH THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION'S OUR STANDARDS FOR PROTECTIVE GEAR? THIS WELL AND FINALLY BY REQUIRING THE COMMISSION ON HEALTHY ON HEALTH SAFETY OF WORKERS COMPENSATION TO CONDUCT THE STUDY OF REPAIR SITES -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH LA COUNTY -- AND WITH OUR APPS MUTE THE THE THE THE UNION REPRESENTING THE WORKERS.

COMPENSATION FOR THOSE WHO TRULY DO NEED IT -- SO FOR ON BEHALF OF THE NINETEEN MEMBERS WHO. OF COME DOWN IN THE SIXTY PERSON UNIT IN LA COUNTY -- WITH CANCER THAT IS LINKED.
