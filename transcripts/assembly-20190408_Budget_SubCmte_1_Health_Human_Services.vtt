THIRD OPTION REINSURANCE WOULD

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:09.665
REQUIRE FEDERAL ENGAGEMENT

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:11.601
THROUGH A WAIVER PROCESS.

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.302

MILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR OF

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:30.987
INCREASE ENROLLMENT BY ABOUT

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:31.587

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.068
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT WHEN PAIRED

MORE AFFORDABLE.

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.572
IN ADDITION TO GENERATING

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:50.606
OFFSETTING REVENUE.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.141
AND INDUCES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.810

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.611
TURN PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:56.712
PREMIUM INCREASES.

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:58.314
AND IT INDUCES MORE FEDERAL

FUNDING BECAUSE THOSE WHO ENROLL

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.251
WITH INCOME BELOW 4100% OF THE

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.719

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.692
BUT AS WE KNOW PREMIUM AND COST

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.194
SHARING SUBSIDIES MAKE COVERAGE

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:14.464
MORE AFFORDABLE AND CREATE

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.498
SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN ENROLLMENT.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.065

RECEIVE HELP PAYING FOR THEIR

4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.722
LEVEL BIGGER SUBSIDIES DO MATTER

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:40.857
AND GENERATE SIGNIFICANT NEW

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.391
ENROLLMENT.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:43.593
AS EXPECTED OR MODELING SHOWS

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:46.829
GREATER ENROLLMENT GAINS AND

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.464
COST SHARING SUBSIDIES BUT COST

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:49.499
SHARING SUBSIDIES ARE AN

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.100
EFFECTIVE TOOL TO INDUCE

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.735
CONSUMERS TO ENROLL MORE

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.570
GENEROUS COVERAGE.

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:55.471
WITH THAT HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY I

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:56.973

MILLION. FOR THE FEDERAL MANDATE --

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:23.826
KIND OF BASED OFF ADDITIONAL

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:26.028
RESEARCH WE'VE DONE WITH FTP AND

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:28.497
THE DIFFERENCES IN THE FEDERAL --

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:31.067
FILING THRESHOLDS FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:32.902

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.804
RUN A PROJECTIONS MAY BE A

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.072
LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH THE FEDERAL

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:38.541
FALLING AT THRESHOLD IS 26%

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:39.709
LOWER THAN CALIFORNIA'S SO FEWER

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.010
CALIFORNIA'S WOULD BE PAYING THE

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.979
PENALTY UNDER.

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.614

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:47.817
INTENDED TO BE AN ANNUAL GENERAL

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:49.719
FUND APPROPRIATION SO THIS WOULD

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:52.922
NOT BE AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM --

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:53.789
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE REVENUE

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:55.625
ESTIMATES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:57.526

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:04.634
IN THE SYSTEM AND HOW THAT MIGHT

ABOUT FROM COVERED CALIFORNIA

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:39.548
WHAT THEIR ANALYSIS SHOWS IS

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:41.116
THAT IT TAKES A SIGNIFICANT

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:43.385
INVESTMENT TO REALLY REDUCE THE

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.154
NUMBER OF UNINSURED TO CUT THE

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:49.425
NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN HALF.

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:50.659

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.164
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:56.699
LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN A SINGLE

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.701
YEAR BUT WE HOPE OVER THE COURSE

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:00.469
OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:02.204
THE TRUST AS CALIFORNIA MADE A

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:04.173
COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE CAL WORKS

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.641
AND A COMMITMENT MULTI YOUR

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:07.209
COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE THE

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:09.478

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:21.457
PENALTY AND THINK IT'S AN

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:23.125
IMPORTANT PART OF A BALANCED

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:26.028
PACKAGE WE HOWEVER DO NOT THINK

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.563
THAT THE MANDATE REVENUE.

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.965
ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.600
THE LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY THAT

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.103
IS NECESSARY ONE OF THE THINGS

01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:35.604
WE LEARNED IN THE AFFORDABILITY

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.706
WORK GROUP IS THAT ABOUT A THIRD

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:39.642
OF THE PEOPLE WITH INSURANCE AS

WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE BELOW

01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:55.157
210050% OF POVERTY I THINK WE

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.759
HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:58.327
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE THINK

01:09:58.394 --> 01:09:59.995
FOLKS IN THAT THOSE INCOME

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:01.030
LEVELS.

NEED HELP AS WELL WE HAVE

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:04.800
CALIFORNIANS WHO MAKE LESS THAN

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.669
A HUNDRED AND 38% OF POVERTY

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:08.537
THAT'S ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:09.638
DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:10.906
MOST OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:13.609
MEDICARE ALL BUT A SMALL NUMBER

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:15.477
OF THEM OUR EYES ARE THERE

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:16.612
LAWFUL IMMIGRANTS OR P..

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.280
PEOPLE MOSTLY WOMEN WHO ARE NOT

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:19.715
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE AND WHO

01:10:19.782 --> 01:10:22.251
HAVE TO PAY 2% OF THEIR INCOME

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:23.752
FOR PREMIUMS WHICH DOESN'T SOUND

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:24.620
LIKE A LOT OF MONEY UNLESS

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:26.789
YOU'RE TRYING TO LIVE ON FIFTEEN

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.457
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:29.792
AND MORE FOR COPAYS AND

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.393
DEDUCTIBLES.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.095
AND SIMILARLY WHEN PEOPLE HIT

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:35.431
THAT HUNDRED AND 38% OF POVERTY

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:37.299
THEY GO FROM ZERO PREMIUM MEDI

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:40.235
CAL AND ZERO COPAY MEDI CAL TO

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:42.071
PAYING 2% OF INCOME.

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:44.440
AGAIN THAT'S NOT FOLKS MAKE IT

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:47.943
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU'RE

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:49.278
NOT MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:50.312
THERE'S ANOTHER CLEAR FOOT 2100%

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:51.547
OF POVERTY PEOPLE DON'T GET VERY

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:53.482
MUCH HELP PAYING FOR COPAYS AND

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:54.717
DEDUCTIBLES THERE ARE.

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.352
A LOT OF THEM BY WHAT'S CALLED

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:57.753
BRONZE COVERAGE WHICH HAS A

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.821
DEDUCTIBLE.

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:03.292
OF ARE YOU READY FOR THIS SIX

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:04.126
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:05.661
AND THE ONLY THING YOU GET

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.262
BEFORE THE DEDUCTIBLE ARE THREE

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:09.865
DOCTOR VISITS AT SEVENTY FIVE OR

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.133
EIGHTY DOLLARS A VISIT.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.368
THEY MAKE THAT CHOICE BECAUSE

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:14.036
THE PREMIUMS ARE LOWER THAN THE

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:18.107
STANDARD COVERAGE WHICH HAS A

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:18.741
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:19.041
DEDUCTIBLE.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.644
SO WE THINK THE PEOPLE BELOW

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.245
210050% OF POVERTY NEED HELP WE

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:25.914
ALSO THINK THAT PEOPLE LIKE MISS

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:27.182
HAAS IS GOING TO SPEAK NEXT.

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:29.351
UP COR ABOVE 4100% OF POVERTY

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.120
NEED HELP AS WELL AND WE VERY

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.155
MUCH APPRECIATE THAT PART OF THE

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:36.025
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- WE ARE A

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.126
LITTLE TROUBLED THAT THERE'S A

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:39.061
SUNSET ON THE AFFORDABILITY HELP

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.530
BUT NOT A SUNSET ON THE PENALTY

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:43.432
THAT SEEMS ODD TO US.

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:45.501
WE UNDERSTAND SUNSETS FOR PRETTY

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.803
COMMON IN THIS TOWN. FOR NEW

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:51.040
PROGRAMS BUT IT DOES SEEM ODD TO

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:51.907
US THAT THERE WOULD BE A SUNSET

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.375
ON ONE PIECE AND NOT THE OTHER

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:54.276
SO.

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.211
WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION

01:11:56.278 --> 01:11:57.746
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:11:57.813 --> 01:12:00.049
APPRECIATE -- UNDERSTANDING

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:02.317
BETTER THEY'RE THINKING -- AND

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:03.385
LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:05.254
WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WITH

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.555
THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE OTHER

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:09.658
HOUSE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:10.459
BUDGET PROCESS [inaudible]

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:13.495
THANK YOU.

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:15.798
HI MY NAME IS CLARE HOSP -- I

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:17.166
LIVE IN OAKLAND.

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:20.069
AND BEFORE THE ACA I KNEW THAT I

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:21.470
NEEDED A JOB THEY GAVE ME HEALTH

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.472
CARE -- I HAVE MITRAL VALVE

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:25.507
PROLAPSE WHICH IS A HEART MURMUR

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:27.209
THAT DOESN'T CAUSE ME ANY

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:29.645
CHALLENGES AT ALL IN MY LIFE --

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.080
BUT WAS THE PRE EXISTING

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.515
CONDITION THAT DENIED INSURANCE

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:35.851
TO ME FROM AN INSURANCE COMPANY --

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:37.453
BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE COVERED

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:39.221
CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR I LEFT MY

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:41.957
JOB AS A NONPROFIT ADMIN -- AND

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.425
I STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS AND I

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:45.160
KNEW THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:47.663
HEALTH CARE -- MY HUSBAND IS AN

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.099
ADJUNCT PROFESSOR HE GOT A PHD

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:52.000
FOUND A JOB TEACHING -- BUT GETS

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:54.169
PAID VERY LOW AS L. ADJUNCT TO

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:58.107
AND DOES NOT GET ANY BENEFITS --

01:12:58.173 --> 01:13:00.576
IF WE WERE NOT MARRIED WE WOULD

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:02.978
BOTH QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES --

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:06.148
INDIVIDUALLY WE A INCOME IS

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:07.316
WITHIN THE THRESHOLD THAT WE

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:09.284
WOULD GET A SUBSIDY BUT BECAUSE

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:11.420
WE'RE MARRIED -- INCOME JUST

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:13.555
EXCEEDS THAT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:15.390
DOLLAR CAP AND WE DON'T GET ANY

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:17.292
SUBSIDY AT ALL.

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:19.795
AND THE GRATES ARE KEEP GOING UP

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:22.898
EVERY YEAR -- SO I ENROLLED IN

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.266
COBRA FROM MY FORMER EMPLOYEE

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.001
EMPLOYER BECAUSE IT WAS ACTUALLY

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.603
A BETTER VALUE.

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:29.338
AND MY HUSBAND AND ROLE THAN

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:30.405
THAT BROWN'S PAYMENT PLAN THAT

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:32.341
BETH WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT --

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:34.276
AND TOGETHER WE PAY MORE THAN

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:35.711
NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AND

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.012
HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:39.381
THAT COMES OUT TO A LITTLE OVER

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:41.250
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR --

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:43.952
IT'S ABOUT 15% OF OUR INCOME.

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:46.355
AND IT'S FOR PREMIUMS IT'S NOT

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.290
FOR ACTUAL HEALTH CARE IT'S JUST

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:51.627
TO PAY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES --

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:52.828
SO EVERY MONTH WHEN WE HAVE TO

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:53.662
PAY OUR BILL WE HAVE THE

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:55.697
CONVERSATION AGAIN OF SHOULD WE

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:58.100
JUST GET DIVORCED -- BECAUSE

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.501
THEN WE WOULD GET SOME SUBSIDY

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:01.103
AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY SO

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.005
MUCH FOR HEALTH CARE.

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:03.539
WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT GOING

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:04.706
WITHOUT.

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:07.009
HEALTH INSURANCE AND EVEN IF

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:08.744
THERE WAS A PENALTY -- WITHOUT

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.245
IT BEING MORE FOR AFFORDABLE

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:13.515
THAT WOULD.

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:16.385
PROBABLY BE BETTER FOR US --

01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:18.120
HEALTHCARE IS A GUY IT SHOULD BE

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:19.755
QUALITY IT SHOULD BE FREE -- AND

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:21.023
IF IT'S NOT FREE AT AT LEAST

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:23.458
SHOULD BE VERY AFFORDABLE -- ONE

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:24.493
OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS I HAVE

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.028
ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:28.163
THE VARIABLE FUNDING LEVELS FROM

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:30.666
YEAR TO YEAR -- AS A SELF

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:32.668
EMPLOYED INDIVIDUAL THE THOUGHT

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.169
THAT I COULD GET A SUBSIDY THAT

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:35.737
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:37.105
HELP ME ONE YEAR.

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:38.674
AND THAT THEN THE NEXT YEAR IT

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:42.177
COULD GO AWAY -- SEEMS LIKE.

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:43.612
BOTH REALLY DIFFICULT TO TO

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:44.479
MANAGE IN TERMS OF

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:47.149
PREDICTABILITY -- BUT IT ALSO

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:48.483
SEEMS LIKE A BIG IT WOULD JUST

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:50.385
BE VERY HARD TO SUDDENLY NOT BE

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:52.321
ABLE TO AFFORD IT -- SO I THINK

01:14:52.387 --> 01:14:53.522
THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:54.556
REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:55.724
I I REALLY WOULD LIKE IT'S NOT

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.326
SUNSET AND THREE YEARS I WOULD

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:58.293
LOVE TO KNOW THAT I HAVE

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.094
AFFORDABLE.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.330
COVERAGE FOR THE LONG TERM SOME

01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:02.831
THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible]

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:05.234
THANK YOU.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.602
GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:07.936
MEMBERS HAD CHEN FLORI WITH

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:09.071
WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:11.807
POVERTY -- I AGREE WITH A LOT OF

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:13.775
WHAT MS KAPELL SAID REGARDING --

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.143
YOU KNOW WHO STILL CAN'T AFFORD

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:16.979
HEALTH CARE -- YOU KNOW WE

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:18.213
UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.115
ABOVE 4100% THEY HAVE A REAL

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:22.150
CLIP FOR THEIR GETTING NO HELP --

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:23.886
BUT IT WILL TAKE CONSIDERABLE

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:25.621
INVESTMENT FOR HEALTH CARE TO

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:27.956
TRULY BECOME AFFORDABLE -- WE DO

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.391
HAVE CONCERNS AS WESTERN CENTER

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:30.659
REINSTATING THE INDIVIDUAL

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:32.494
MANDATE WITHOUT GIVING MORE

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:34.997
AFFORDABILITY ASSISTANCE --

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:37.099
IRONICALLY THE PROPOSAL THAT

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:39.001
TIES THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE TO

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:40.168
THE STATE FILING THRESHOLD DOES

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:42.204
ALLEVIATE A LOT OF OUR CONCERNS

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:43.906
IN THAT AREA BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:45.274
LOW INCOME PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE.

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.375
SUBJECT TO THE INDIVIDUAL

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:47.809
MANDATE BUT THEY STILL WOULDN'T

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:48.644
HAVE COVERAGE THAT THEY COULD

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.412
AFFORD SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.347
BETTER -- YOU KNOW AS LONG AS

01:15:52.414 --> 01:15:53.415
WE'RE DOING THIS HALL IT'S DO

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.550
THIS TOGETHER SO THAT -- YOU

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:56.952
KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT --

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:58.153
MISS CAPELL MENTIONED THERE'S

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.656
THE GROUP BETWEEN BELOW 138% OF

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:01.924
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THEY

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:03.558
CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY ANYTHING FOR

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:04.893
HEALTH CARE AND STILL PAY FOR

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.795
RENT AND FOOD -- THESE PEOPLE

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.931
BUT FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:09.765
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:12.100
AL -- THEIR QUALIFIED -- THEY'RE

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:13.568
LAWFULLY PRESENT IMMIGRANTS WHO

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:14.403
JUST DON'T HAPPEN TO BE

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:15.938
TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED UNDER THE

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:18.140
MEDIC HOW RULES -- AS BETH

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:19.875
MENTION THERE'S A SMALL SUBSET

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.009
OF PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY WHO ARE

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:23.078
OVER SIXTY FIVE WHO QUALIFY FOR

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:25.213
NEITHER MEDI CAL NOR MEDICARE

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.750
WHO ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THIS

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.118
RULE -- AND THEN FOR THOSE GOING

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:31.586
JUST ABOVE 138% THE PARTICULARLY

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:32.821
IF YOU CONSIDER THAT A LOT OF

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.156
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:35.857
FROM MEDIC HAL INTO INDIVIDUAL

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:38.493
MARKET COVERAGE -- IT'S IT'S NOT

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.028
LIKE YOU TYPICALLY GO FROM MEDIC

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:41.630
HOWTHE EARNING A LOT OF MONEY

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:42.864
AND IN FACT A LOT OF THEM HAVE A

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:44.533
LOT OF UNMET NEEDS THAT THEY'VE

01:16:44.599 --> 01:16:45.734
BEENGOING WITHOUT FOR QUITE

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:46.868
SOME TIME.

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.203
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:51.940
BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL -- SO.

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.008
YOU THEY GO FROM BEING A

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:54.910
ELIGIBLE FOR FREE CARE TO HAVING

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:56.445
MONTHLY PREMIUMS AND OUT OF

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:58.113
POCKET COSTS AND IF THEY ENROLL

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.648
IN THE RIGHT PLAN THEY GET

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:01.383
CONSIDERABLY MORE ASSISTANCE BUT

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.718
MANY OF THEM SEE THAT ONE DOLLAR

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:04.152
PREMIUM ON THE BRONZE PLAN THEY

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:05.721
MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND THEN.

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.189
THEY FIND THEMSELVES SUBJECT TO

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:10.058
VERY HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS SO.

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:11.460
IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE EITHER WAY

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:13.295
AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S THAT

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:15.630
OTHER CLIFF -- I THINK WHEN THE

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.632
GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION IS

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:18.233
TALKING ABOUT THERE'S QUITE A

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.736
LOT OF HELP AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.471
BELOW 210050% OF THE FEDERAL

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.638
POVERTY LEVEL.

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:25.140
PART OF WHAT THEY'RE REFERRING

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:25.607
TO IS THE COST SHARING

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:27.542
REDUCTIONS BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:30.345
WHAT YOU PAY. FOR YOUR SILVER

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:32.180
PLAN WHETHER YOU'RE A BETWEEN AT

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.482
2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:35.884
LEVEL OR 210050% OF THE FEDERAL

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:38.754
POVERTY LEVEL IS NOT A LOT --

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.623
PEOPLE WHO ARE AT 210050% OVER

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.492
IT THEY WOULD ENROLL IN A SILVER

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.760
SEVENTY PLAN WITH AN ACTUARIAL

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:46.962
VALUE OF SEVENTY PEOPLE WHO

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:49.398
ENROLL AT 2100% WOULD ENROLL IN

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:51.333
A SILVER SEVENTY THREE PLAN WITH

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.502
AN ACTUARIAL VALUE ON AVERAGE OF

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:55.003
73%.

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:56.972
THAT DIFFERENCE IN 3% SOMETIMES

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:58.640
IT'S JUST FIVE DOLLARS IN A CO

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:01.676
PAY -- SO YOU INSTEAD OF PAYING

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:02.677
THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR YOUR

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.279
PRIMARY CARE YOU PAY FORTY

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.714
DOLLARS FOR PEOPLE AT THESE

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:07.349
INCOME LEVELS THAT'S NOT REALLY

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:09.184
A SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE AND SO

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.586
IT'S PEOPLE STARTING AT 2100%.

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:13.522
THAT REALLY NEED QUITE A LOT OF

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:16.024
EXTRA SYSTEMS -- TO A PREVIOUS

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:17.659
STUDY THAT ACTUALLY WAS CITED IN

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:20.228
THE AB EIGHTEEN TEN A REPORT OF

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:22.597
INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES --

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:23.698
TALKING ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.267
AFFORD THEIR PREMIUMS AN OUT OF

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.735
POCKET COSTS FOUND THAT PEOPLE

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:29.371
EARNING BELOW 210050% REPORTED

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:31.440
THE EXACT SAME DIFFICULTY AND

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:32.941
AFFORDING PREMIUMS ARE USING

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:33.809
THEIR HEALTHCARE.

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.077
DESPITE ALL OF THIS EXTRA

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.945
ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:38.513
HAVE LESS MONEY.

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.682
ON THE FLIP SIDE WHEN THEY DID

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:42.184
THE MODELING FOR THE UPTAKE IF

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.552
WE GIVE PEOPLE ADDITIONAL

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.454
ASSISTANCE PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:47.189
END OF THE INCOME SCALE ARE ALSO

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:48.690
THE MOST PRICE SENSITIVE AND ARE

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:50.192
MORE LIKELY TO ENROLL EVEN WITH

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.127
SMALL AMOUNTS OF ADDITIONAL

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:53.428
ASSISTANCE.

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:55.430
SO -- WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.732
THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY

01:18:57.799 --> 01:18:59.768
LOOK AT AFFORDABILITY THAT WE'RE

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:02.204
LOOKING AT IT IN TOTALITY AND

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.939
NOT JUST ON WHO'S GETTING HELP

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.407
AND WHO'S NOT GETTING HELP.

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:06.842
BUT IN WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS HELP

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:07.742
AND IT'S QUITE A LOT OF

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:11.113
CALIFORNIANS AND IT'S GOING TO

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:12.747
TAKE SOME OF TIONAL INVESTMENT

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:13.448
BEYOND WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:15.784
MANDATE PENALTIES WILL GENERATE.

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:17.519
MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD JUST ADD

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.054
ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:20.655
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:22.757
IS THE STRUCTURE THAT THEY HAVE

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:25.026
PROPOSED TO CREATE WHICH IS THAT

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.195
YOU WOULD APPROPRIATE ANNUALLY

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:30.065
AND THEN COVERED CALIFORNIA.

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:31.366
WHICH HAS A HISTORY OF WORKING

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:32.901
VERY COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.269
HEALTH PLANS.

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:36.905
AND WITH THE CONSUMER ADVOCATES

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:38.773
WOULD THEN DEVELOP WOULD THEN

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.643
LOOK AT HOW -- TO MAKE THAT

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:43.879
AFFORDABILITY MONEY WORK AND SO

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:45.914
THAT STRUCTURE OF THE FRANCHISE

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:48.116
TAX BOARD IMPOSES THE PENALTY

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:50.785
COVERED CALIFORNIA DESIGNS THE

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:52.154
AFFORDABILITY HELP.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.022
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:58.493
DOING EVERY YEAR SINCE GOSH --

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.060
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IT'S AN

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.295
ANNUAL PROCESS CALLED BENEFIT

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:01.363
DESIGN WORK GROUP WE DO WITH SO

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:03.131
WE DO WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:04.900
DESIGN WHAT THE FEDERAL HELP

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.668
WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR CONSUMERS.

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:08.904
AND THIS WOULD ADD ON THE STATE

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:11.907
HELP AND SO THAT BASIC STRUCTURE

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:12.741
THAT IS PROPOSED IN THE

01:20:12.807 --> 01:20:14.643
GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL MAKES A

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.478
LOT OF SENSE I THINK TO THE

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:17.879
ADVOCACY COMMUNITY.

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:18.914
AND IT'S SOMETHING WE THINK

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.882
COULD WORK WELL WE JUST WANT TO

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:21.616
MAKE SURE.

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:23.852
THAT AS THEY'RE DOING THAT THEY

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:26.855
HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO HELP

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.957
PEOPLE.

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:29.558
BELOW THE LOWEST INCOME THE

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:31.359
PEOPLE BELOW 210050% AS WELL AS

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:34.563
THE PEOPLE 2100526100%.

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:36.164
AND THEIR COURSE FEW OTHER

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:37.232
CHANGES WOULD LIKE IN THE

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:38.800
TRAILER BILLS WE INDICATED BUT

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:41.369
THAT THAT BASIC STRUCTURE WE

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:43.505
THINK IT'S VERY SOLID WARY --

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:46.274
APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:47.475
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:47.776
[inaudible]

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:53.081
THANK YOU.

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:56.051
I THINK RYAN.

01:20:56.117 --> 01:20:57.919
YOUR LAST.

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.854
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR RYAN WILL

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:01.389
SAY THAT.

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:02.791
THANK YOU RIGHT.

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:03.391
WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:06.394
OFFICE -- IN EARLY FEBRUARY --

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:07.429
OUR OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:08.096
WITH PRELIMINARY COMMENTS ON THE

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:08.730
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO IN STATE

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.031
AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE FOR HEALTH

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:11.533
INSURANCE COVERAGE.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.469
AND TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIES -- THAT

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.438
THAT REPORT WAS PRESENTED AT A

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:17.505
JOINT HEARING THAT THIS

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:19.608
COMMITTEE PARTICIPATED IN -- I'M

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:20.308
HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH THOSE

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:21.843
COMMENTS AT YOUR DIRECTION BUT

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.545
WANTED TO DEFINITELY HIGHLIGHT --

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:24.813
SOME ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT WE

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:25.914
THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PAY

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:27.315
ATTENTION TO NOW THAT MORE

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:29.117
DETAILS -- HAVE AS HAVE BEEN

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.485
DESCRIBED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:32.287
FINANCE ARE NOW AVAILABLE ABOUT

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:33.421
THE PROPOSAL.

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:34.923
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:37.559
WOULD ECHO IS -- SOMETHING'S

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.094
BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY ABOUT HOW

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.229
VERY CLOSELY TYING THE AMOUNT OF

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:43.598
SUBSIDIES TO THE AMOUNT OF

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.200
PENALTY REVENUES GENERATED COULD

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:45.867
RESULT.

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:48.103
IN SOME SWINGS IN THE AMOUNT OF

01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:49.638
ASSISTANCE THAT'S AVAILABLE THAT

01:21:49.704 --> 01:21:51.039
COULD CREATE SOME UNCERTAINTY

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:53.174
AND CONFUSION -- FOR PEOPLE THAT

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:55.110
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FOR THE

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:56.711
SUBSIDIES.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:57.912
WHEN I AM WE WOULD JUST NOTE

01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:01.082
HOWEVER THAT-- THE STRUCTURE

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.317
THAT IT'S BEEN PROPOSES THAT THE

01:22:02.384 --> 01:22:03.618
PENALTY REVENUES WILL GO INTO

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.920
THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN THE

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:07.455
COST OF THE SUBSIDIES WILL ALSO

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:08.857
COME OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND SO

01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:10.258
FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE.

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:12.427
THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU HAVE

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:15.397
TO TIE THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE --

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:17.032
SO CLOSELY TO THE AMOUNT OF

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.600
PENANCE PENALTY REVENUES SO.

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:20.602
THE LEGISLATURE COULD CHOOSE.

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:23.204
TO SET THOSE -- SUBSIDY LEVELS

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:23.972
THAT MORE CONSISTENT AMOUNT --

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:26.074
AT THAT THAT WOULDN'T HAVE TO

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:28.209
CHANGE NECESSARILY TO REFLECT.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.644
CHANGES IN PENALTY REVENUES.

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:32.514
THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO NOTE

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.182
IS THAT -- IT'S BEEN MENTIONED

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.818
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:38.386
TO MODEL VERY CLOSELY ON THE

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.422
FEDERAL STRUCTURE -- AS PART OF

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:41.756
THAT THE ASSISTANCE WOULD BE

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.491
PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF TAX

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:44.159
CREDITS.

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:45.927
THAT IS OF COURSE AND THE WAY

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.829
THAT THE FEDERAL ADVANCE PREMIUM

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:49.230
TAX CREDIT WORKS HOWEVER.

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.733
IN -- SOME STATES THAT HAVE

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.435
STATE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE ON THIS

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:55.704
ASSISTANCE IS VERY SIMILAR TO

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.105
THE FEDERAL ADVANCE PREMIUM TAX

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.473
CREDIT EXCEPT THAT.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.842
IT IS NOT ACTUALLY A TAX CREDIT

01:23:00.909 --> 01:23:02.377
FOR EXAMPLE IN IN THE STATE OF

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:03.478
MASSACHUSETTS.

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:04.946
ADDITIONAL STATE ASSISTANCE IS

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.881
PROVIDED -- DIRECTLY TO

01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:08.450
INSURANCE COMPANIES UP FRONT

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:09.651
MUCH LIKE THE ADVANCE FROM TAX

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:12.487
CREDIT WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:14.756
THERE IS NO NEED TO RECONCILE

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.991
THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE THAT

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:19.894
WAS ADVANCED EARLIER IN THE YEAR.

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:20.995
AT TAX FILING TIME.

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.163
THIS MEANS IS THAT IF A PERSON

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:24.132
HAS A SITUATION THAT CHANGES

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:25.400
DURING THE YEARS SAY THEY START

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.535
EARNING MORE OR LESS MONEY THAN

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:28.436
THEY DID.

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:29.804
WHEN THEY ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:31.473
THEIR ASSISTANCE AMOUNT?

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:33.041
THEY WOULD PROSPECTIVELY HAVE A

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:34.476
DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:35.810
THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE BUT

01:23:35.877 --> 01:23:37.579
THERE WOULD BE NO -- ATTEMPT

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:40.115
MADE BY THE STATE TO GO BACK AND

01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:41.516
RECONCILE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:44.185
ANNUAL INCOME WAS VERY CLOSELY.

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:45.754
TIED TO THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.455
RECEIVED -- IN THE CASE OF

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:48.656
MASSACHUSETTS IT'S OUR

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:50.191
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS DESIGN

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:51.459
DECISION WAS MADE.

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:52.961
FROM A RECOGNITION THAT IT

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:53.895
WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT FOR THAT

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:56.264
STATE TO TO DO THE

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:57.399
RECONCILIATION THAT WAY.

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.200
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO

01:23:59.267 --> 01:24:00.869
BE THE CASE FOR CALIFORNIA -- WE

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:01.836
UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:03.438
ADMINISTRATION IS PREPARING AN

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:05.607
ESTIMATE OF THE COST FOR

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:06.808
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.176
ADMINISTER THIS TAX CREDIT.

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:09.444
AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:10.779
LEGISLATURE COULD ASK THE

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:11.446
ADMINISTRATION TO FURTHER

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:14.082
CONSIDER WHAT WOULD BE THE

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:16.818
IMPLICATIONS OF PURSUING THIS

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.686
ASSISTANCE NOT OF THE TAX CREDIT.

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.255
WE COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE SOME

01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:21.790
MONEY IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:23.792
COSS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:25.727
WOULD BE THE IMPLICATIONS ON THE

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:27.328
AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED.

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:28.196
AND IN THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:30.799
MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THE

01:24:30.865 --> 01:24:34.135
CORRECT COURSE OF ACTION ON THAT.

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:37.639
VERY GOOD THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:38.706
WOULD.

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:40.341
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR --

WE'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN WORKING ON

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:45.113
THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW --

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.016
AND AFTER A SELECT COMMITTEE AND

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:49.451
THAN THE BILLS WERE INTRODUCED --

01:24:49.517 --> 01:24:51.286

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:54.989
THAT MARCH OF LAST YEAR -- AND

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.357
SOME OF THE BILL'S MADE IT SOME

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:59.427
OF THEM DIDN'T MAKE IT -- AND WE

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:00.628
WERE ABLE TO MAKE A A LITTLE BIT

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:01.830
OF PROGRESS THIS YEAR I'M

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:04.165
CARRYING A BILL AB ONE SEVENTY

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:05.800
FOUR WHICH MIRRORS IN SOME SOME

01:25:05.867 --> 01:25:07.402
RESPECTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:09.771
ON AFFORDABILITY -- AND WE ARE

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:11.773
STILL WORKING WITH THE NUMBERS

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.007
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:14.375
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:16.144
POSSIBLE RANGE BUT IT IS.

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:18.413
A SIMILAR TO TO WORK WE HAVE WE

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.981
HAD ANTICIPATED BASED ON OUR

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:22.817
FINDINGS -- OVER A YEAR AGO NOW.

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:25.920
SO I AM A COUPLE THINGS I AM I I

TO THE LA -- THAT MAYBE THERE

01:25:31.025 --> 01:25:32.160
MIGHT BE ANOTHER OPTION OTHER

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:34.295
THAN A TAX CREDIT -- I DO WONDER

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:35.196
IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:37.532
THAT -- UNLESS I'M

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:39.434

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.005
AFTER THE FACT SO YOU'RE PAYING

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:46.674
UP FRONT -- AND IF IF I'M

01:25:46.741 --> 01:25:49.010
MISUNDERSTANDING THAT -- I'D

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:50.278
LIKE TO KNOW THAT BUT BUT IT IF

01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:51.246
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:52.647
AFFORDABILITY IN PEOPLE'S

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:55.116

01:25:55.183 --> 01:25:56.751
NOT SURE THAT HELPS IN THE WAY

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:59.120
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT HELP THE

01:25:59.187 --> 01:25:59.821
SUBSIDY.

YEP MORE CONSISTENT OR OVERTIME

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:07.195
MIGHT MIGHT BE I THINK A MORE

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:09.063
VALUABLE WAY TO DO THAT.

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:09.697
BECAUSE I THINK IT ONE OF THOSE

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:10.899
CHALLENGES PEOPLE HAVE IS

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.267
ACTUALLY WRITING THAT CHECK ON A

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.635
MONTHLY BASIS.

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.336
SO THEY'RE WAITING FOR A TEMP

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:16.971
FEDERAL TAX CREDIT TO COME BACK

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:19.307
AND IF I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THIS

PLEASE RYAN -- OR SOMEBODY HELP

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:22.810

HERE BECAUSE I'M I'M A LITTLE

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:28.349
UNCLEAR QUITE FRANKLY -- SUBJECT

LAND APARNA FINANCE SO THE TAX

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:31.052
CREDITS PROBABLY A BIT OF A

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:33.588
MISNOMER WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:35.223
IS ENVISIONING WITH THE PROPOSAL

01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:36.257
IS THAT.

01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:37.492
ON BENEFICIARY WOULD ENROLL FOR

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:38.726
COVERAGE AND COVER CALIFORNIA

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:40.261

SUBSIDY AMOUNT DETERMINED.

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:42.664
AND WHAT THAT SUBSIDY AMOUNT IS

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:44.198
DETERMINED COVERED CALIFORNIA

01:26:44.265 --> 01:26:45.567
WOULD BE PAYING THOSE HEALTH

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:51.172
PLANS ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:53.575
TO READ USE THOSE.

01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:54.809
OKAY PREMIUM COSTS FOR THOSE

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:55.743
CONSUMERS -- AT THE END OF THE

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:57.645
YEAR WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.280
REPORT THEIR ACTUAL INCOMES TO

01:26:59.347 --> 01:26:59.881
F. THREE B. THEN WE WOULD GO

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:01.382
BACK AND RECONCILE TO THE ACTUAL

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:03.851
INCOME COMPARED TO THEIR

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:07.889
REPORTED INCOME.

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:10.592
OF BETH BELL HEALTH IF MANAGER

01:27:10.658 --> 01:27:12.493
WITH BETH CAPELL HEALTH ACCESS --

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:13.628
SO THE RECONCILIATION OF THE

01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:15.229
FEDERAL TAX CREDIT WHICH IS IN

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:19.367
FACT IN INCOME TAX CREDIT -- IS

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:20.935
MAKES SOME SENSE TO US BECAUSE

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.437
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GET A LOT

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.005
OF HELP YOU KNOW THE KIDS IT CAN

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:25.807
BE AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:26.441
A MONTH.

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:27.275
HOWEVER AS THE COMMITTEE

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:29.444
ANALYSIS SUGGEST IN THIS CASE

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:30.979
FOR MANY PEOPLE IT WILL BE MORE

01:27:31.045 --> 01:27:32.880
ON THE ORDER OF TWENTY OR THIRTY

01:27:32.947 --> 01:27:35.950
DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:27:36.017 --> 01:27:37.251
AND SO DEPENDING ON WHETHER WE

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:38.286
HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:40.054
REVENUE PROPOSAL OR SOMETHING

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:42.023
CLOSER TO WHAT THE ASSEMBLY

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.125
CONTEMPLATED BLASTER.

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:47.495
BUT WE WE HAVE QUESTIONS WE

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:50.098
DON'T THINK TECH RECONCILIATION

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:52.100
ON YOUR INCOME TAXES NECESSARILY

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:55.236
MAKE SENSE OR IS NECESSARY.

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:56.638
AND IT SAID MEN AS LA --

01:27:56.704 --> 01:27:58.640
INDICATED ITS ADMINISTRATIVELY

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:01.342
BURDENSOME AND AND EXPENSIVE.

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:02.110
FOR PEOPLE ARE GETTING A LOT OF

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.845
HELP WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:06.180
TRUE UP BUT WE WOULD ALSO REMIND

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:09.717
CHIU THAT MOST PEOPLE USE ABOUT

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:10.518
HALF OF THOSE WHO ARE IN COVERED%

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:13.955
CALIFORNIA -- THERE FOR LESS

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:14.722
THAN A YEAR.

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:15.857
AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE THERE'S AN

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:17.058
ANNUAL INCOME RE DETERMINATION

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.693
WHEN THEY RE ENROLL SO THERE'S

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.695
NO REASON WHY WE COULDN'T DO

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:23.197
WHAT MASSACHUSETTS AND VERMONT

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:25.366
ACTUALLY BOTH DO WHICH IS TO NOT

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:28.302
USE THE INCOME TAX STRUCTURE.

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:29.103
WHAT AND I ADMIT WE'RE LOOKING

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.538
AT THE TAX CREDIT PART OF IT IS

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:31.639
IN OUR BILLS WELL BUT WE'RE

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:33.441
STILL WE'RE STILL SOMEWHAT IN

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:35.376
FLUX AND IS HOW HOW WE COULD

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:35.576
MAKE?

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:38.312
US TO MAKE THIS WORK -- THIS THE

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.148
THE MANDATE AS I UNDERSTAND IT

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:43.584
WOULDN'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL.

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:44.952
TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT BY LAW BUT

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:48.990
THE REVENUE WOULDN'T COME UNTIL.

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.425
TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE YOU

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:52.427
BECAUSE OF THE FOR THE WAY TAXES

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.528
ARE FILED.

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:55.296
SO THAT MEANS.

01:28:55.363 --> 01:29:00.068
A COUPLE YEARS OF SO SIGNIFICANT

01:29:00.134 --> 01:29:01.102
GENERAL FUND SO BACK FROM

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.603
MECHANICALLY HOW THIS WOULD WORK

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.138
YES WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT IT

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:06.407
WOULD THERE BE A GENERAL FUND --

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:07.408
SHOULD THE JENNIFER WILL BE ON

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:09.177
THE HOOK FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS

01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:11.145
BEFORE THOSE PENALTY REVENUES --

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:13.114
ACTUALLY ACCRUED TO THE GENERAL

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:15.516
FUND BASED OFF THE THE FIRST

01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:16.150
YEAR THE MANDATE PENALTY AND SO

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:17.051
I THINK.

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:18.152
THE REASON WHY THE

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:19.320
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:20.722
DEPOSIT PENALTY REVENUE INTO THE

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:21.789
GENERAL FUND AND PAY FOR THE

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.758
SUBSIDY PROGRAM OUT OF THE

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:24.459
GENERAL FUND.

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:25.460
I NATIONALLY WE HAD CONTEMPLATED

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:26.527
SETTING UP A SPECIAL FUND TO DO

01:29:26.594 --> 01:29:28.529
THIS BUT BECAUSE OF THE TIMING

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:30.198
DELAYS WITH THE KIND OF ONE THE

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:33.201
REVENUE WOULD ACTUALLY -- COME

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:34.435
INTO THE STATE WERE HIS ONE WE'D

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:38.473
WANTED TO START THIS PROGRAM

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:40.641
THAT DATES JUST DIDN'T OUTLINE.

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:41.709
SO SO IS MY IS MY UNDERSTANDING

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:43.411
AND THAT THE THE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:44.245
PLAN IS THAT THE BUT IS THERE

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:45.379
ANY WOULD THERE BE ANY GENERAL

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:46.814
FUND.

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:49.784
EXPENDITURE -- BE ON THE

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:52.520
PENALTIES IN TO HELP WITH THE

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:53.921
WITH THE AFFORDABILITY.

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:56.424
RIGHT NOW THERE ISN'T DOES NOT

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:57.625
INTEND RIGHT NOW THE ANTENNAS

01:29:57.692 --> 01:29:58.860
THAT TRACK IS CLOSER TO THE

01:29:58.926 --> 01:30:00.061
PENALTY REVENUE AS POSSIBLE WITH

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:01.596
THE TIMING ISSUE OBVIOUSLY THE

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:03.297
FIRST YEAR IS GOING TO BE BASED

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:04.632
HEAVILY ON THOSE REVENUE.

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:05.800
ESTIMATES THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:06.601
WORKING WITH THAT TO BE TO

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:08.002
DEVELOP RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.538
AT A MULTI YEAR REVENUE ESTIMATE --

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:12.073
BASED OFF THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.375
IT MAKES SENSE TO LOOK AT THE

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:15.143
REVENUE WE THINK WE COLLECT IN

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:16.377
THE FIRST YEAR.

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:17.678
SECOND YEAR AND THIRD YEAR TO

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:20.281
KIND OF HAVE A YOU -- OVER

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:22.316
ARCHING REVENUE ESTIMATE TO BEST

01:30:22.383 --> 01:30:24.152
DESIGN THAT SUBSIDY PROGRAM --

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.253
BUT YOU ARE CORRECT THERE WOULD

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:27.054
BE SOME TIMING ISSUES IN TERMS

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.122
OF ON THE DOLLARS WOULD COME IN

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.090
AND WHEN THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:30.358
WITH FIRST START.

01:30:30.424 --> 01:30:31.659
MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS.

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:33.828
SO OTHER THAN ADMINISTERING THIS

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:35.429
IT'S NOT THERE REALLY ISN'T --

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:37.265
THE STATE IS IS THERE TO HELP

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:38.699
YOU IT'S IT'S WE'RE HERE.

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:42.703
TO USE THE PENALTY MONEY TO PAY

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:43.538
FOR THIS [inaudible]

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:46.741
SO.

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:48.376
AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE THAT.

01:30:48.442 --> 01:30:49.177
I THINK.

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:49.844
AGAIN WITH THE SAUCE THE PROGRAM

01:30:49.911 --> 01:30:51.546
GENERALLY THE ANTENNAS TO HELP

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:53.614
THE BROADER ISSUE AFFORDABILITY

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:56.083
BUT WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:57.385
GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED A

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:59.153
PARTICULAR FUNDING SOURCE FOR

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.321
THIS PROPOSAL AND THAT'S IT IT

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:01.656
IS ENTIRELY SO THERE'S NO

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:02.990
THERE'S NO INTENT NO INTENTION

01:31:03.057 --> 01:31:04.458
FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY. TO HELP

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:07.295
WITH AFFORDABILITY IT'S JUST

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:08.329
GONNA BE BASED ON THE PANEL.

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:10.731
WHICH WON'T BE FOR AWHILE YET SO

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:12.400
SO HOW HOW WAS HOW WAS HOUSING

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:13.601
ADMINISTRATION GOING TO HOW HOW

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:14.836
IS THE ADMINISTRATION GOING TO

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:15.937
PROJECT.

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:18.906
HOW MUCH REVENUE WILL BE AND AND

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:21.142
WHAT HAPPENS IF IF IT'S?

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:23.010
UNDER PROJECTED ROBERT OVER

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:24.879
PROJECTED I'M A NO I WOULD DO WE

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:26.714
REALLY KNOW WE NEED WE MIGHT I

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:27.582
MEAN MAYBE THIS QUESTION FOR

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:28.616
CANCER COVER CALIFORNIA.

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:30.351
DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:31.219
WHAT THE WHAT THE PANEL WELL

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.020
GUESS WHAT THE PENALTY IS GOING

01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:33.688
TO BE.

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:35.122
AND WHAT KIND OF REVENUE IT

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.890
WOULD GENERATE.

01:31:35.957 --> 01:31:37.859
AND AND SO WE ARE WORKING VERY

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:39.227
CLOSELY WITH THE F. T. B. AND

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:40.995
COVER CALIFORNIA MODEL WHAT THAT

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:42.630
PENALTY REVENUE WOULD LOOK LIKE

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:44.098
AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY.

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:46.467
WE HAVE THE IRS DATA THAT IS OUR

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:48.169
ACTUAL FOR WHAT CALIFORNIA'S PAY

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:49.136
FOR THE FEDERAL PENALTY BECAUSE

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:50.071
WE'RE NEARING THE FINAL FEDERAL

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:51.772
PENALTY SO CLOSELY THAT'S A GOOD

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:52.840
STARTING POINT.

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:53.808
HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME VERY

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.042
ABILITY WITH OUR DIFFERENT

01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:57.712
FILING THRESHOLDS -- LACKING THE

01:31:57.778 --> 01:31:58.980
MANDATE FOR A YEAR HOW WHAT

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:00.214
IMPACT THAT HAD ON THE NUMBER OF

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.582
PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE SO

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:02.416
THAT.

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:03.451
AMOUNT PROBABLY INCREASE

01:32:03.517 --> 01:32:05.386
COMPARED WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF

01:32:05.453 --> 01:32:07.855
WE HAD MAINTAINED THAT PENALTY

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:10.825
ON GOING.

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:12.293
AND I THINK.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.995
I THINK MODELING THIS WERE BEING

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:15.529
VERY COGNIZANT OF THE

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:17.598
FLUCTUATION OF VERY ABILITY

01:32:17.665 --> 01:32:18.633
CONCERNS OUT THERE ARE.

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:19.667
RELATED TO CHANGING THAT SUBSIDY

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:22.770
AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:25.740
AND SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE.

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.875
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DESIGN A

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:29.143
SUBSIDY PROGRAM THAT.

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:30.344
LOOKS AT THE THREE YEAR PERIOD

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:33.347
OF AVAILABLE FUNDING AND TRYING

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:35.283
TO MODEL IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:36.550
IN A WAY THAT.

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:38.152
MAYBE LIMITS THAT VARIABILITY

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:41.722
YOUR TWO YEAR.

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:44.125
SO WHAT IS THE IS SO WE'RE WE'RE

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:44.759
IN THE PROCESS THE MODELING NOW

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:46.294
SO WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.561
OF WHAT FOOT ROUGHLY WHAT THAT'S

01:32:47.628 --> 01:32:48.562
GOING TO BE.

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:50.097
AT THIS TIME THE ONLY NUMBER I

01:32:50.164 --> 01:32:51.032
CAN SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT FIVE

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:52.333
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.035
LESS 26% FOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:55.536
FILING THRESHOLD WERE HOPING TO

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:56.771
HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:59.607
WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL NUMBERS TO

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:00.875
SHARE WITH YOU I'M A REVISION.

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:03.344
AND THAT POTENTIALLY -- HELPS

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.780
WITH WHAT TWENTY TO THIRTY

01:33:05.846 --> 01:33:08.683
DOLLARS A MONTH IS THAT ROUGHLY

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:10.451
WHAT WE'RE PROJECTING AS FAR AS

01:33:10.518 --> 01:33:12.987
I THOUGHT I GET THAT SO MAKE

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:15.556
NEXT QUESTION GOING TO BE. TO

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:16.891
THANK YOU I JUST WANT NO I MEAN

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:18.893
IS IT GONNA HELPERS AGAIN OUT

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.227
TWENTY THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH IS

01:33:20.294 --> 01:33:25.299
THAT GOING TO HELP.

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:26.267
IN WORK KATY REBEL COVER

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:27.735
CALIFORNIA WERE ALSO PROVIDING

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:29.003
SUPPORT TO THE ADMINISTRATION ON

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:30.538
THIS I THINK THE FUNDING WILL

01:33:30.604 --> 01:33:31.639
LOOK DIFFERENT THE AMOUNT OF

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:32.640
STATE SUPPORT WILL LOOK

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:34.342
DIFFERENT UNDER 4100% OF THE

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.043
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WERE WILL

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:37.611
BE ADDING.

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.547
TO AN THAT FURTHER ADDING TO THE

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:40.915
FEDERAL CAP THAT EXISTS.

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:43.217
OVER 4100% WILL BE PUTTING A CAP

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:45.219
IN PLACE RIGHT NOW SO CONSUMERS

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.754
TODAY PAY ANY PERCENTAGE OF

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:48.055
THEIR INCOME THAT IT WORKS OUT

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:49.357
TO THE PREMIUM AS A PERCENTAGE

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:50.524
OF THEIR INCOME.

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:52.760
WILL BE PUTTING IN A CAP AND SO

01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:53.694
THOSE CONSUMERS WILL THEN HAVE

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:54.729
THE BENEFIT OF A SIMILAR

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:56.230
STRUCTURE THAT PEOPLE DO WITH

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:57.832
THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT TODAY.

01:33:57.898 --> 01:34:00.935
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT POINT THANK

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:01.669
YOU.

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:03.004
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THEN

01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:04.105
MY FINAL QUESTION THANK YOU

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:05.906
MADAM CHAIR FOR I I APOLOGIZE

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:06.941
FROM TAKING UP TOO MUCH TIME

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:07.341
HERE.

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:10.144
SO THE THE MANDATE PENALTY IS

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:12.947
GOING TO GO ON IN PERPETUITY.

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:15.850
BUT THE PROGRAM SUNSETS IN.

01:34:15.916 --> 01:34:16.684
TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'M SORRY I'M

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:20.955
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:22.656
SO I THINK WITH THESE WITH THE

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:24.191
SUBSIDY PROGRAM HAVING THE

01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:25.459
SUNSET PERIOD AND TWENTY TWENTY

01:34:25.526 --> 01:34:26.861
TWO ALLOWS TO ASSESS WHETHER OR

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:28.229
NOT THE PROGRAM IS ACHIEVING THE

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:30.297
BROADER GOALS OF AFFORDABILITY

01:34:30.364 --> 01:34:31.298
THAT WE'VE LAID OUT.

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:33.868
REGARDING THE PENALTY SIDE --

01:34:33.934 --> 01:34:35.236
YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE PENALTY

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:37.538
ITSELF DOES NOT SUNSET TO TWENTY

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:38.639
TWENTY TWO THERE IS LANGUAGE IN

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:39.807
THERE THAT WOULD TIE IT.

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:40.474
THAT WOULD ADJUSTED

01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:42.243
AUTOMATICALLY IF THE FEDERAL

01:34:42.309 --> 01:34:43.577
GOVERNMENT WERE TO REINSTATE A

01:34:43.644 --> 01:34:45.513
PENALTY AT THEIR LEVEL AND SO

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:46.847
THE CALIFORNIA PENALTY WOULD

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:48.482
DECREASE CORRESPONDINGLY.

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:49.850
I THINK.

01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:56.057
OVERALL AS NOTED BY THE GOVERNOR --

01:34:56.123 --> 01:34:56.657
ADDRESSING THESE AFFORDABILITY

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:57.725
CHALLENGE WILL TAKE FEDERAL

01:34:57.792 --> 01:34:58.359
PARTNERSHIP IN FEDERAL ACTION I

01:34:58.426 --> 01:34:59.360
THINK THAT THIS IS THE FIRST

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:01.228
STEP IN TRYING.

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:02.463
TO ADDRESS THESE AFFORDABILITY

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.298
OF AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES WERE

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.833
WE CAN BUT IT WILL.

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.234
TAKE FOR THE CORONATION AND FOR

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:08.402
THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:09.937
GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO BROADEN THE

01:35:10.004 --> 01:35:11.472
ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:12.573
BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY.

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.008
SO I GUESS I GUESS WHAT I'M WHAT

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:16.944
I'M GETTING AT IS IS WHITE WIRE.

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:18.612
WITH WHY NOT HAVE LANGUAGE THAT

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:23.417
SAYS THAT -- THAT LEAVES A MORE

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:24.418
OPEN ENDED I MEAN THE LAST.

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:25.553
WITH THE SUNSET THAT REQUIRES

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:27.021
YOU GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK WITH

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:28.789
ANOTHER BILL AT SOME POINT IF

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.391
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T.

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:32.193
GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER OR OR WE

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:33.694
DON'T BUT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO

01:35:33.761 --> 01:35:34.662
COURT AND AND I'M NOT SURE.

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:37.698
IF WE DON'T GET A COOPERATION WE

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:38.265
DON'T GET SOMETHING WITH THE

01:35:38.332 --> 01:35:39.500
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TWENTY

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:40.935
TWENTY TWO IS NOT THAT FAR AWAY

01:35:41.001 --> 01:35:43.537
AND AND SO -- IN THE MEANTIME

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.306
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO COLLECT

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:47.741
TO THE THE THE REV THE PENALTY

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:51.846
REVENUE -- AYE AYE I JUST.

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:53.047
IS THERE A WAY TO STRUCTURE THIS

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:54.615
SO THAT THE LANGUAGE WOULD SAY

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:56.584
THAT YOU KNOW THIS IF IF THE IF

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:58.385
IF THEREIS NO AGREEMENT THAT

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE --

02:10:33.725 --> 02:10:36.695
WE WE ANALYZE THIS ISSUE IN A

02:10:36.762 --> 02:10:38.096
COUPLE OF REPORTS ONE ON THE

02:10:38.163 --> 02:10:39.598
MEDI CAL SPECIFICALLY AND ONE ON

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:41.233
THE GENERAL REALIGNMENT

02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:41.934
STRUCTURE.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.870
AND WE FIND THAT -- FOR THE A.

02:10:44.937 --> 02:10:46.605
B. EIGHTY FIVE PROPOSAL THAT

02:10:46.672 --> 02:10:48.207
SOME INCREASE IN THE RE

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:50.209
DIRECTION -- IS LIKELY

02:10:50.275 --> 02:10:51.710
APPROPRIATE.

02:10:51.777 --> 02:10:53.478
TO A HELP -- PAY FOR THE COST OF

02:10:53.545 --> 02:10:55.514
THE EXPANSION BUT MORE SO TO

02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:57.616
ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE COSTS

02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:59.251
THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN ON FOR

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:01.420
EXPANDING COVERAGE -- WE BELIEVE

02:11:01.486 --> 02:11:03.155
IT'S APPROPRIATE GIVEN -- THAT

02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:05.524
HOW HOW INDIGENT CARE CASELOADS

02:11:05.591 --> 02:11:08.460
HAVE GONE DOWN AND ALSO FOR THE

02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:10.629
REASON THAT -- THE CMS P. BOARD

02:11:10.696 --> 02:11:12.631
HAS ACCUMULATED A LARGE RESERVE

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:14.132
THAT WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS TO

02:11:14.199 --> 02:11:15.934
SPEND DOWN -- EVEN UNDER ITS

02:11:16.001 --> 02:11:17.636
CURRENT BUDGET WITH THAT WITH

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:19.037
THE COVERAGE EXPANSION.

02:11:19.104 --> 02:11:20.606
THAT SAID WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS

02:11:20.672 --> 02:11:22.140
ABOUT THE SCOPE AND THE

02:11:22.207 --> 02:11:23.675
MAGNITUDE OF THE PROPOSED

02:11:23.742 --> 02:11:26.478
INCREASE IN THE REDIRECTION --

02:11:26.545 --> 02:11:28.247
FIRST WE BELIEVE IT COULD HAVE

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:30.449
AN IMPACT ON CERTAIN COUNTIES

02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:33.218
NOT NOT THE C. M. S. P. COUNTIES

02:11:33.285 --> 02:11:35.053
BUT FIVE OTHER COUNTIES --

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:36.455
ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:37.623
EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH

02:11:37.689 --> 02:11:40.492
ACTIVITIES AND THEN SECOND EVEN

02:11:40.559 --> 02:11:43.262
WITH REGARD TO THE CMS BE IT THE

02:11:43.328 --> 02:11:44.763
THE PROPOSAL DOES CALL INTO

02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:46.732

FUTURE -- EVENTUALLY MAYBE THERE

02:12:00.412 --> 02:12:02.180
WOULD BE HAVE TO BE CHANGES --

02:12:02.247 --> 02:12:03.548
TO TO THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE OR

02:12:03.615 --> 02:12:05.350
SO FORTH TO ALLOW IT TO HAVE

02:12:05.417 --> 02:12:06.752
FUNDING GOING FORWARD SHOULD

02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:08.820

EIGHT COUNTIES.

02:18:06.945 --> 02:18:07.779
I THINK.

02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:09.180
THIS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:11.049
OBVIOUSLY BUT IF YOU TOTAL IT UP

02:18:11.116 --> 02:18:12.484
IT'S THIRTY NINE COUNTIES THAT

02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:13.952
WOULD BE AFFECTED IT'S THE

02:18:14.019 --> 02:18:15.353
ARTICLE THIRTEEN COUNTIES IN THE

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:16.588
C. M. S. P. COUNTIES.

AND WHILE THIS ADVERSELY

02:18:18.423 --> 02:18:20.625
AFFECTED ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE

02:18:20.692 --> 02:18:22.327
SAME AS PEOPLE WARD THIS.

02:18:22.394 --> 02:18:25.897
CHANGE IN RATIO FROM SIXTY FORTY

02:18:25.964 --> 02:18:26.464
TO SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE

02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:27.098
WOULD AFFECT THE SAME MUST BE

02:18:27.165 --> 02:18:28.133
BORED BUT THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY

02:18:28.199 --> 02:18:30.235
AFFECT THE SAME SP COUNTIES AND

02:18:30.301 --> 02:18:31.102
THE PATH TO HEALTH PROGRAM YOU

02:18:31.169 --> 02:18:31.870
HEARD ABOUT.

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:33.471
ALSO ARE -- ALL THIRTY NINE

02:18:33.538 --> 02:18:36.207
COUNTIES -- IN VARIOUS WAYS ARE

02:18:36.274 --> 02:18:38.009
OFFERING SOME SERVICES TO

UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS AS WELL AS

02:18:39.611 --> 02:18:41.212

LAINSON AND OTHERS.

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:46.051
AND SO THIS PROPOSAL THIS CHANGE

02:18:46.117 --> 02:18:48.787
FROM SIXTY FORTY TO SEVENTY FIVE

02:18:48.853 --> 02:18:49.320
TWENTY FIVE IS ARBITRARY.

02:18:49.387 --> 02:18:50.889
IT'S NOT REALLY BASED ON ANY

02:18:50.955 --> 02:18:52.257
MATH THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

02:18:52.323 --> 02:18:54.426
DETERMINE -- WE DO REALIZE THAT

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:56.127
WITH THE EXPANSION -- BUT THERE

02:18:56.194 --> 02:18:57.662
COULD BE SOME SAVINGS ON THE

02:18:57.729 --> 02:18:59.264
COUNTY SIDE BUT AGAIN -- MANY

02:18:59.330 --> 02:19:00.832
COUNTIES ARE OFFERING SERVICES

02:19:00.899 --> 02:19:03.068

THE STATE AND I THINK IT'S JUST

02:19:57.288 --> 02:19:58.423
IMPORTANT TO WALK BACK IN REAL

02:19:58.490 --> 02:20:00.291
RECOGNIZE HOW NINETEEN NINETY

02:20:00.358 --> 02:20:01.059
ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT IS USED

02:20:01.126 --> 02:20:02.293
SO IT'S BOTH INDIGENT CARE

02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:03.528

CITIZENSHIP STATUS AND I SAY

02:20:10.135 --> 02:20:13.037
THAT BECAUSE WHEN COUNTIES OPTED

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:14.139
FOR THE SIXTY FORTY OUR

02:20:14.205 --> 02:20:15.807
UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT 40% UNDER

02:20:15.874 --> 02:20:17.509
THIS DEAL OF AB EIGHTY FIVE IS

02:20:17.575 --> 02:20:19.043
THAT THAT 40% WOULD BE RETAINED

02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.344

02:20:26.651 --> 02:20:28.052
EXPANSION OF MEDIC HOW IN SOME

02:20:28.119 --> 02:20:30.054

02:20:30.121 --> 02:20:31.923
TO JUST RECALL THAT UNDER THE AB

02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.557
EIGHTY FIVE CONSTRUCT THERE'S A

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:34.492

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:35.860
THE JURISDICTIONS THAT OPTED TO

02:20:35.927 --> 02:20:36.861
USE THAT.

02:20:36.928 --> 02:20:38.296
THERE IS A IS A PROTECTION THERE

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:39.564
IT'S A MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:42.100
THAT THEY DON'T -- SWEEP MORE

02:20:42.167 --> 02:20:43.401

02:25:07.198 --> 02:25:08.733
RAISE THE INCOME LIMIT AT THE

02:25:10.234 --> 02:25:12.203
PROGRAM TO A HUNDRED AND 38% OF

02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:13.738
THE FEDERAL FEDERAL POVERTY

02:25:13.805 --> 02:25:14.605
LEVEL.

02:25:14.672 --> 02:25:16.307
CREATING PARITY BETWEEN SENIORS

02:25:16.374 --> 02:25:17.742
AND THE DISABLED MEDICARE

02:25:17.809 --> 02:25:19.410
BENEFICIARIES AND OTHER MEDICARE

02:25:19.477 --> 02:25:20.812
BENEFICIARIES.

02:25:20.878 --> 02:25:22.280
SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA

02:25:22.346 --> 02:25:24.015
MOST ADULTS CAN NOW QUALIFY FOR

02:25:24.082 --> 02:25:25.349
MEDI CAL IF THEY HAVE AN INCOME

02:25:25.416 --> 02:25:27.685
BELOW 110038% OF THE FEDERAL

02:25:27.752 --> 02:25:28.953
POVERTY LEVEL.

02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:30.655
THE ACA HOWEVER DID NOT CHANGE

02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:31.756
THE INCOME LEVEL FOR THE MEDI

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:33.491
CAL AGED AND DISABLED PROGRAM

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:34.926
WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO A HUNDRED

02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:37.495
AND 22% OF THE FEDERAL PART OF

02:25:37.562 --> 02:25:38.830
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

02:25:38.896 --> 02:25:40.098
THIS MEANS THAT A SIXTY FOUR

02:25:40.164 --> 02:25:41.199
YEAR OLD ADULT WITH FREE MEDI

02:25:41.265 --> 02:25:42.533
CAL CAN LOSE IT.

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:44.602
THE DAY THEY TURN SIXTY FIVE

02:25:44.669 --> 02:25:45.403
YEARS OLD.

02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:46.504
THE SENIOR WITH AN INCOME OF

02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:49.340
EVEN ONE DOLLAR OVER THE 122% OF

02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:51.142
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THRESHOLD

02:25:51.209 --> 02:25:52.643
IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE.

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:55.246
WITH EXPENSIVE SHERIFF COST THE

02:25:55.313 --> 02:25:56.180
ONLY WAY FOR SENIORS WITH

02:25:56.247 --> 02:25:58.382
INCOMES ABOVE A HUNDRED AND 22%

02:25:58.449 --> 02:25:59.550
OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO

02:25:59.617 --> 02:26:01.586
ACCESS MEDI CAL BENEFITS IS TO

02:26:01.652 --> 02:26:03.054
PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.

02:26:03.121 --> 02:26:04.956
IN A MONTHLY MEDI CAL SHARE CROC

02:26:05.022 --> 02:26:07.024
COST OF OVER SIX HUNDRED AND

02:26:07.091 --> 02:26:08.426
FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH WHICH

02:26:08.493 --> 02:26:10.661
MANY SENIORS SIMPLY CANNOT

02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:11.496
AFFORD TO PAY.

02:26:11.562 --> 02:26:12.864
THIS CREATES A SIGNIFICANT BERRY

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:14.565
FOR SENIORS TO EXCESS AFFORDABLE

02:26:14.632 --> 02:26:15.867
HEALTH CARE.

02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.502
RATED THE AGED RAISING THE AGED

02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:19.337
AND DISABLED INCOME LIMIT TO A

02:26:19.403 --> 02:26:20.638
HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FAR

02:26:20.705 --> 02:26:22.106
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS THE

02:26:22.173 --> 02:26:23.074
MOST APPROPRIATE.

02:26:23.141 --> 02:26:24.775
AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ENSURE

02:26:24.842 --> 02:26:26.511
LOW INCOME SENIORS HAVE ECOBILL

02:26:26.577 --> 02:26:28.045
EQUITABLE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE

02:26:28.112 --> 02:26:29.113
HEALTHCARE.

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:30.114
THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD

02:26:30.181 --> 02:26:31.115
ENSURE THAT THE VULNERABLE

02:26:31.182 --> 02:26:33.151
POPULATION OF LOW INCOME SENIORS

02:26:33.217 --> 02:26:34.218
ARE TREATED FAIRLY.

02:26:34.285 --> 02:26:35.620
AND COULD HAVE ACCESS TO

02:26:35.686 --> 02:26:37.155
AFFORDABLE MEDICAL CARE WITHOUT

02:26:37.221 --> 02:26:38.623

LAW AND POVERTY THANK YOU FOR

02:26:51.068 --> 02:26:52.737
CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL.

02:26:52.803 --> 02:26:54.071
IT IS UNFAIR THAT SENIORS AND

02:26:54.138 --> 02:26:55.439
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE

02:26:55.506 --> 02:26:57.108
SUBJECT TO A LOWER INCOME

02:26:57.175 --> 02:27:00.077
ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD OF ABOUT A

02:27:00.144 --> 02:27:01.045
HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS LOWER A

02:27:01.112 --> 02:27:03.681
MONTH TO QUALIFY FOR FREE MEDI

02:27:03.748 --> 02:27:05.249
CAL IF A SENIOR PERSON.

02:27:05.316 --> 02:27:07.218
WITH DISABILITY HAS AN INCOME OF

02:27:07.285 --> 02:27:08.719
MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED AND

02:27:08.786 --> 02:27:10.521
FORTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH HERE

02:27:10.588 --> 02:27:12.390
SHE CAN ONLY GET FREE MEDIC.

02:27:12.456 --> 02:27:14.192
CAN GET MEDICARE WITH A SHARE OF

02:27:14.258 --> 02:27:15.726
THE COST I SHARE CAST IS THE

02:27:15.793 --> 02:27:17.428
AMOUNT AN INDIVIDUAL MUST PAY

02:27:17.495 --> 02:27:19.130
FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE BEFORE MEDI

02:27:19.197 --> 02:27:20.398
CAL KICKS IN.

02:27:20.464 --> 02:27:21.899
A PERSON'S SHARE COST IF THEIR

02:27:21.966 --> 02:27:24.335
MONTHLY INCOME MINUS SIX HUNDRED

02:27:24.402 --> 02:27:26.103
DOLLARS THIS IS BASED ON THE

02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:27.672
ANTIQUATED IDEA THAT PEOPLE CAN

02:27:27.738 --> 02:27:29.207
LIVE OFF OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:27:29.273 --> 02:27:29.907
A MONTH.

02:27:29.974 --> 02:27:32.176
THIS MAY MADE SENSE IN NINETEEN

02:27:32.243 --> 02:27:32.944
EIGHTY NINE WHEN THAT THRESHOLD

02:27:33.010 --> 02:27:36.814
WITH THAT BUT CERTAINLY DOESN'T

02:27:36.881 --> 02:27:37.848
MAKE SENSE NOW.

02:27:37.915 --> 02:27:39.183
EVERY YEAR THERE AGING DISABLED

02:27:39.250 --> 02:27:40.251
INCOME LIMIT LOSES GROUND BUT IS

02:27:40.318 --> 02:27:42.620
ESPECIALLY HARD FELT THIS YEAR I

02:27:42.687 --> 02:27:44.622
LEGAL AID ADVOCATES REPORT AN

02:27:44.689 --> 02:27:45.756
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

02:27:45.823 --> 02:27:47.458
CLIENTS WHO ARE NO LONGER

02:27:47.525 --> 02:27:49.093
ELIGIBLE FOR FREE MEDI CAL.

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:51.262
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF A COST OF

02:27:51.329 --> 02:27:52.463
LIVING ADJUSTMENT IN THEIR

02:27:52.530 --> 02:27:53.598
SOCIAL SECURITY.

02:27:53.664 --> 02:27:54.999
THE AVERAGE COST OF LIVING

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:56.934
ADJUSTMENT INCREASE FOR SOCIAL

02:27:57.001 --> 02:27:59.337
SECURITY IS THIRTY NINE DOLLARS

02:27:59.403 --> 02:28:01.138
FOR THIS YEAR TEN DOLLARS HIGHER

02:28:01.205 --> 02:28:03.441
THAN THE AGING DISABLED INCOME

02:28:03.507 --> 02:28:04.875
INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR.

02:28:04.942 --> 02:28:06.377
MANY OF THESE RETIREES WOULD

02:28:06.444 --> 02:28:09.313
HAPPILY GIVE UP THAT EXTRA

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:10.348
THIRTY NINE DOLLARS IN INCOME

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:12.783
RATHER THAN PAY A SEVEN HUNDRED

02:28:12.850 --> 02:28:14.151
DOLLAR SHERIFF COST.

02:28:14.218 --> 02:28:15.720
FORCE BETWEEN PAYING FOR RENT

02:28:15.786 --> 02:28:18.089
AND FOOD OR THEIR MEDI CAL SHARE

02:28:18.155 --> 02:28:19.490
OF COSTS MANY FOREGO NEEDED

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:21.492
MEDICAL SERVICES PROMPTING THEM

02:28:21.559 --> 02:28:22.693
TO MOVE INTO A SKIRT SKILLED

02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:24.462
NURSING FACILITY AT A HIGH COST

02:28:24.528 --> 02:28:26.063
TO THE STATE.

02:28:26.130 --> 02:28:27.865
AND EVEN HIGHER PERSONAL COSTS

02:28:27.932 --> 02:28:28.933
TO THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND WELL

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:29.734
BEING.

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:31.969
WE URGE THE SECOND SUBCOMMITTEE

02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:35.506

CARE SERVICES SO JUST FROM --

02:28:42.847 --> 02:28:44.215
TECHNICAL OPERATION STANDPOINT

02:28:44.282 --> 02:28:45.583
CERTAINLY IF THE PROPOSAL IS

02:28:45.650 --> 02:28:47.084
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE COULD

02:28:47.151 --> 02:28:48.619
SEEK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:28:48.686 --> 02:28:50.054
THERE ARE FISCAL ISSUES THAT

02:28:50.121 --> 02:28:51.656
I'LL DEFER TO MY DEPARTMENT

02:28:51.722 --> 02:28:52.890
FINANCE COLLEAGUE.

02:28:52.957 --> 02:28:54.425
JUST A COUPLE THINGS TO NOTE ONE

02:28:54.492 --> 02:28:55.459
WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY NEED FEDERAL

02:28:55.526 --> 02:28:57.895
APPROVAL TO DO THIS EXPANSION

02:28:57.962 --> 02:29:00.665
AND THE OTHER BEING THAT --

02:29:00.731 --> 02:29:02.533
BECAUSE AS THIS COMMITTEE WEALTH

02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:03.834
KNOW WHO'S AS DO THE PEOPLE

02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:05.369
SITTING AT THIS TABLE MEDI CAL

02:29:05.436 --> 02:29:07.772
BEING AS COMPLICATED AS IT IS.

02:29:07.838 --> 02:29:09.840
IT'S NOT EXACTLY PARITY BECAUSE

02:29:09.907 --> 02:29:11.008
OF THE DIFFERENT INCOME

02:29:11.075 --> 02:29:12.343
DISREGARD SO I THINK WE WOULD

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:14.211
WANT TO UNDERSTAND -- OF WHAT IS

02:29:14.278 --> 02:29:16.180
THE END GOAL IN TERMS OF IS IT

02:29:16.247 --> 02:29:17.548
PEOPLE WHO AT THE END AFTER

02:29:17.615 --> 02:29:18.883
THEIR INCOME DISREGARDS ARE IT'S

02:29:18.949 --> 02:29:20.284
PARITY SO I THINK THERE'S SOME

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:21.719
TECHNICAL ISSUES WE WOULD NEED

02:29:21.786 --> 02:29:22.386
TO WORK THROUGH SO THAT WE COULD

02:29:22.453 --> 02:29:24.488
PRESENT THOSE. TO SEE A MASS TO

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:25.389
THE DEGREE THIS WAS SOMETHING

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:26.090
THAT.

02:29:26.157 --> 02:29:27.224
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

02:29:27.291 --> 02:29:28.726
ENDED UP INCLUDING THE FINAL

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:32.029
BUDGET BUT I'LL DEFER THE FISCAL

02:29:32.096 --> 02:29:35.099

INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

THANK YOU. ONE OF THE COMMENTS

02:30:09.066 --> 02:30:12.236
FROM A AN ADVOCATE.

SAID TO ME THAT THIS ABSOLUTELY

02:30:14.405 --> 02:30:16.574
LOOKS LIKE.

OUT RIGHT AGE DISCRIMINATION.

02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:19.744
AND IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:21.645
LOOK AT THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER

02:30:21.712 --> 02:30:24.315
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

02:30:24.382 --> 02:30:25.483
110023%.

02:30:25.549 --> 02:30:28.519
VERSUS THE 110038% ESPECIALLY

02:30:28.586 --> 02:30:30.554
BECAUSE OF THE OTHER OTHER

02:30:30.621 --> 02:30:32.523
ELIGIBILITY ISSUES.

02:30:47.605 --> 02:30:49.573
JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT --

02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:51.142
WE REVIEWED THE FISCAL ESTIMATES

02:30:51.208 --> 02:30:52.843
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:54.912
MENTION FROM LAST YEAR -- AND

02:30:54.979 --> 02:30:55.746
FOUND THEM TO BE LARGELY

02:30:55.813 --> 02:30:56.614
REASONABLE THERE WERE SOME

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:58.182
CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT

02:30:58.249 --> 02:30:59.850
A COUPLE OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT I

03:04:13.909 --> 03:04:14.910
WATER.

03:04:14.977 --> 03:04:16.845
UNDER BOTH PROPOSALS ALL OF

03:04:16.912 --> 03:04:18.914
THESE TYPES OF WAYS OF

03:04:18.981 --> 03:04:20.282
DELIVERING SERVICE IN THE

03:04:20.349 --> 03:04:23.118
COMMUNITY WOULD BE COVERED.

03:04:23.185 --> 03:04:24.920
THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE

03:04:24.987 --> 03:04:26.221
BETWEEN THE TWO PROPOSALS AND

03:04:26.288 --> 03:04:28.023
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I DO NOT

03:04:28.090 --> 03:04:29.792
SEE THEM AS COMPLEMENTARY THEY

03:04:29.858 --> 03:04:31.093
ARE DIFFERENT.

03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:33.462
THE KEY DIFFERENCE IS THAT UNDER

03:04:33.529 --> 03:04:36.131
THE C. PEN PROPOSAL THERE'S A

03:04:36.198 --> 03:04:37.766
BUILT IN STRUCTURE OF

03:04:37.833 --> 03:04:40.969
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:04:41.036 --> 03:04:43.472
UNDER THE OTHER PROPOSAL THERE'S

03:04:43.539 --> 03:04:46.141
A SUGGESTION THAT IN INTERESTED

03:04:46.208 --> 03:04:48.844
AND TO TEA RECEIVE THE FUNDS AND

03:04:48.911 --> 03:04:50.212
MAKE THE DISTRIBUTION.

03:04:50.279 --> 03:04:52.181
AND I HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM

03:04:52.247 --> 03:04:53.916
WITH THAT I HOPE THE MEMBERS CAN

03:04:53.982 --> 03:04:56.585
ALSO SEE THAT FOR TRANSPARENCY

03:04:56.652 --> 03:04:58.554
AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE CAN'T BE

03:04:58.620 --> 03:05:00.889
GRANTING THE FUNDS TO ONE OF THE

03:05:00.956 --> 03:05:02.558
INTERESTED ORGANIZATIONS.

03:05:02.624 --> 03:05:04.626
I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE OF

03:05:04.693 --> 03:05:06.929
THE COMMENTS BY THE DEPARTMENT

03:05:06.995 --> 03:05:09.164
UNDER THE A. B..

03:05:09.231 --> 03:05:11.066
EIGHTY TO PROCESS THAT WE HAD IN

03:05:11.133 --> 03:05:12.434
CALIFORNIA WHERE THESE FUNDS

03:05:12.501 --> 03:05:13.602
WERE DISTRIBUTED.

03:05:13.669 --> 03:05:16.371
A MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAIN

03:05:16.438 --> 03:05:18.340
COMPLEXITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT

03:05:18.407 --> 03:05:20.409
WAS THAT IT INITIALLY STARTED

03:05:20.476 --> 03:05:22.377
WITH TWO TYPES OF PROGRAMS ONE

03:05:22.444 --> 03:05:24.146
WAS GRANTS FOR COMMUNITY BASED

03:05:24.213 --> 03:05:26.181
ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE

03:05:26.248 --> 03:05:26.982
ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE

03:05:27.049 --> 03:05:27.850
COUNTIES.

03:05:27.916 --> 03:05:29.351
AND HAD REPORTING FROM THE

03:05:29.418 --> 03:05:32.187
COUNTIES THE OTHER WAS DIRECT

03:05:32.254 --> 03:05:34.923
THE INVOICING BY INDIVIDUAL

03:05:34.990 --> 03:05:36.825
COMMUNITY WORKERS WHO WERE

03:05:36.892 --> 03:05:40.662
PROVIDING ASSISTANCE. TO THE

03:05:40.729 --> 03:05:42.264
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

03:05:42.331 --> 03:05:43.599
SERVICES IN SACRAMENTO AND NOT

03:05:43.665 --> 03:05:44.399
STILL APART RAPIDLY BECAUSE IT

03:05:44.466 --> 03:05:46.068
WAS JUST BEYOND THE CAPACITY.

03:05:46.134 --> 03:05:48.003
OF THE DEPARTMENT TO DEAL WITH

03:05:48.070 --> 03:05:50.305
SO I AM EAGER TO LEARN FROM THE

03:05:50.372 --> 03:05:51.340
DEPARTMENT.

03:05:51.406 --> 03:05:53.509
IF THERE WERE OTHER COMPLEXITIES

03:05:53.575 --> 03:05:55.043
THAT IT'S REFERRING TO WE WOULD

03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:56.512
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE KNOWING

03:05:56.578 --> 03:05:57.079
THAT.

03:05:57.145 --> 03:05:59.014
OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE

03:05:59.081 --> 03:06:01.650
THAT THE COMMUNITY IS SIR THAT

03:06:01.717 --> 03:06:03.352
EVERYONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS

03:06:03.418 --> 03:06:05.187
WHO'VE SPOKEN HERE TODAY GETS

03:06:05.254 --> 03:06:07.623
GOOD TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM

03:06:07.689 --> 03:06:08.924
THEIR ASSOCIATION.

03:06:08.991 --> 03:06:11.126
ABOUT THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY

03:06:11.193 --> 03:06:12.794
AND GETS TO WORK WITH THEIR

03:06:12.861 --> 03:06:16.164
COUNTY TO GET THE MONEY OUT THE

03:06:16.231 --> 03:06:17.499
DOOR IN THE RIGHT WAY -- WE

03:06:17.566 --> 03:06:19.501
WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE IN

03:06:19.568 --> 03:06:21.003
THE TRAILER BILL WITH THIS

03:06:21.069 --> 03:06:23.272
MEASURE WHICH WE REALLY HOPE

03:06:23.338 --> 03:06:24.806
WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE

03:06:24.873 --> 03:06:26.808
STATE BUDGET WE WOULD LIKE TO

03:06:26.875 --> 03:06:29.278
SEE A STRENGTHENING.

03:06:29.344 --> 03:06:31.280
OF THE CORE STRUCTURE THAT WE

03:06:31.346 --> 03:06:33.081
HAD IN PLACE WITH A. B. EIGHTY

03:06:33.148 --> 03:06:35.117
TWO SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE BEEN

03:06:35.183 --> 03:06:37.786
ASKING FOR A LONG TIME. TO HAVE

03:06:37.853 --> 03:06:39.288
A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

03:06:39.354 --> 03:06:41.557
INCORPORATED SO THE DEPARTMENT

03:06:41.623 --> 03:06:43.258
CAN HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITIES

03:06:43.325 --> 03:06:45.260
ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO FEEL

03:06:45.327 --> 03:06:46.595
MORE SECURE ABOUT THE PROGRAM

03:06:46.662 --> 03:06:48.263
WE'D ALSO LIKE MUCH MORE

03:06:48.330 --> 03:06:50.365
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THEIR

03:06:50.432 --> 03:06:52.501
ASSOCIATIONS SO THEY KNOW ABOUT

03:06:52.568 --> 03:06:54.336
THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY AND THE

03:06:54.403 --> 03:06:55.203
DEADLINES.

03:06:55.270 --> 03:06:59.107
ON ANOTHER ISSUE HERE IS THE

03:06:59.174 --> 03:07:02.544
LEGISLATION IN THE PAST GAVE

03:07:02.611 --> 03:07:03.912
SMALL COUNTIES THE OP THE

03:07:03.979 --> 03:07:06.949
OPPORTUNITY THE OPTION TO GROUP

03:07:07.015 --> 03:07:07.916
TOGETHER.

03:07:07.983 --> 03:07:10.619
AND GO THROUGH THE COUNTY

03:07:10.686 --> 03:07:12.588
MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM MORE

03:07:12.654 --> 03:07:14.289
THE SAME S. P. PROGRAM BOARD AND

03:07:14.356 --> 03:07:15.891
GET THEIR FUNDING ADMINISTERED

03:07:15.958 --> 03:07:17.826
THAT WAY FOR EFFICIENCY AND MANY

03:07:17.893 --> 03:07:19.628
GROUPS JUST DIDN'T REALIZE THAT

03:07:19.695 --> 03:07:20.696
THEY WERE ACTUALLY GETTING

03:07:20.762 --> 03:07:21.663
FUNDED.

03:07:21.730 --> 03:07:22.898
BUT IT WAS COMING THROUGH THE

03:07:22.965 --> 03:07:24.433
SAME AS PEOPLE ARE SO IN

03:07:24.499 --> 03:07:26.401
CONCLUSION I URGE MEMBERS TO

03:07:26.468 --> 03:07:27.970
THINK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY

03:07:28.036 --> 03:07:29.638
ACCOUNTABILITY THE FUNDS REALLY

03:07:29.705 --> 03:07:31.173
SHOULDN'T GO TO AN INTERESTED

03:07:31.239 --> 03:07:31.873
PARTY THEY SHOULD BE

03:07:31.940 --> 03:07:33.308
ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE

03:07:33.375 --> 03:07:34.476
THROUGH THE COUNTIES FOR

03:07:34.543 --> 03:07:37.512

PATHWAY THIS IS ON BEHALF OF THE

03:08:45.614 --> 03:08:47.149
CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S COVERAGE

03:08:47.215 --> 03:08:48.550

C. H. I. AS WELL AS ON MARCH OF

03:08:56.758 --> 03:08:59.428
DIMES -- SO WE ESTIMATE THAT

THIS WILL BE ABOUT -- FIVE

03:09:01.129 --> 03:09:02.831
MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN

03:09:02.898 --> 03:09:04.299
THE BUDGET YEAR.

03:09:04.366 --> 03:09:06.001
RIGHT NOW THERE'S UP ABOUT HALF

03:09:06.068 --> 03:09:08.570
OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

03:09:08.637 --> 03:09:10.138
THAT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:09:10.205 --> 03:09:11.540
UNINSURED KIDS AND CHILDREN AND

03:09:11.606 --> 03:09:12.541

03:09:14.509 --> 03:09:16.378
RIGHT NOW SO REALLY THE WORK IN

03:09:16.445 --> 03:09:18.213
ON BEHALF OF COVERAGE FOR

03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:20.148
CHILDREN INVOLVES MAXIMIZING

03:09:20.215 --> 03:09:22.350
ENROLLMENT GOING TO THE PLACES

03:09:22.417 --> 03:09:24.519
WHERE THEY ARE -- ONE SMART

03:09:24.586 --> 03:09:26.288
STRATEGY THAT WE'VE COME ACROSS

03:09:26.354 --> 03:09:28.190
IS GOING TO OTHER PROGRAMS IN

03:09:28.256 --> 03:09:29.725
THE STATE WHERE ARE THESE

03:09:29.791 --> 03:09:31.960
CHILDREN ARE FINDING WHICH ONES

03:09:32.027 --> 03:09:33.195
ARE NOT ENROLLED IN MEDICAID OUT

03:09:33.261 --> 03:09:35.197
AND ROLLED ENROLLING LARGE

03:09:35.263 --> 03:09:36.965
NUMBERS OF THEM THERE -- FOR

03:09:37.032 --> 03:09:38.834
EXAMPLE THE WICK PROGRAM WHICH

03:09:38.900 --> 03:09:40.202
IS A NUTRITIONAL PROGRAM FOR

03:09:40.268 --> 03:09:44.139
PREGNANT MOTHERS INFANTS AND

03:09:44.206 --> 03:09:46.742
CHILDREN -- HAS RIGHT NOW ABOUT

03:09:46.808 --> 03:09:48.043
NINETY THOUSAND OR AND THE MOST

03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:50.479
RECENT DATA WE GOT WAS EIGHTY

03:09:50.545 --> 03:09:51.113
FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT ARE

03:09:51.179 --> 03:09:53.115
RIGHT NOW ON WAY BACK THAT ARE

03:09:53.181 --> 03:09:54.449
NOT ROLLED IN MEDI CAL.

03:09:54.516 --> 03:09:55.984
BUT BECAUSE OF THE ELIGIBILITY

03:09:56.051 --> 03:09:57.819
RULES EVERYONE OF THEM SHOULD BE

03:09:57.886 --> 03:10:01.623
ENROLLED SIMILARLY THERE'S ABOUT

03:10:01.690 --> 03:10:02.224
ELEVEN THOUSAND PREGNANT WOMEN

03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:04.159
ON THE WICK PROGRAM THAT ARE NOT

03:10:04.226 --> 03:10:05.160
ENROLLED.

03:10:05.227 --> 03:10:07.262
IN MEDICAID I'LL AND AGAIN

03:10:07.329 --> 03:10:08.530
THEY'RE ALL ELIGIBLE.

03:10:08.597 --> 03:10:10.832
SO -- THAT'S KIND OF CONCERNING

03:10:10.899 --> 03:10:12.768
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BECAUSE THE

03:10:12.834 --> 03:10:15.237
STATE WE KNOW -- THE NAMES AND

03:10:15.303 --> 03:10:17.539
CONTACT INFORMATION OF ALL OF

03:10:17.606 --> 03:10:18.673
THESE THOUSANDS TENS OF

03:10:18.740 --> 03:10:20.642
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN THAT ARE

03:10:20.709 --> 03:10:22.077
ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ENROLLED BUT

03:10:22.144 --> 03:10:23.445
THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S A

03:10:23.512 --> 03:10:25.147
REALLY SMART STRATEGY THAT WE

03:10:25.213 --> 03:10:27.449
COULD UTILIZE TO ENROLL THEM

03:10:27.516 --> 03:10:28.150
QUICKLY.

03:10:28.216 --> 03:10:29.551
USING THE INFORMATION THAT'S

03:10:29.618 --> 03:10:31.720
ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED FROM WORK

03:10:31.787 --> 03:10:33.421
THIS IS CALLED A OF FEDERAL

03:10:33.488 --> 03:10:35.724
MEDICAID LAW -- CALLED EXPRESS

03:10:35.791 --> 03:10:37.959
LANE ELIGIBILITY HOW THAT WORKS

03:10:38.026 --> 03:10:40.862
IS THAT -- THE WICK INFORMATION

03:10:40.929 --> 03:10:43.498
CAN BE USED AS FINDINGS FOR MEDI

03:10:43.565 --> 03:10:45.500
CAL SO MEDI CAL DOESN'T NEED TO

03:10:45.567 --> 03:10:47.369
RE ASK THESE QUESTIONS AS A NEED

03:10:47.435 --> 03:10:49.004
TO RECALCULATE IN COMICS THAT

03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:50.105
ARE A WE CAN USE THAT

03:10:50.172 --> 03:10:51.907
INFORMATION ALREADY COLLECTED

03:10:51.973 --> 03:10:53.241
FROM WAY BACK. TO START A

03:10:53.308 --> 03:10:55.210
MEDICAID APPLICATION AND EXPRESS

03:10:55.277 --> 03:10:56.077
AND ROLL THEM.

03:10:56.144 --> 03:10:57.612
JUST QUICKLY ON THE BUDGET

03:10:57.679 --> 03:10:59.881
NUMBERS WE ESTIMATED FIVE

03:10:59.948 --> 03:11:02.017
MILLION -- ON THE ASSUMPTION

03:11:02.083 --> 03:11:03.618
THAT ARE A LOT OF THE FIRST YEAR

03:11:03.685 --> 03:11:05.587
WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEM

03:11:05.654 --> 03:11:07.989
MODIFICATIONS OF WHICH THERE'S A

03:11:08.056 --> 03:11:09.357
NINETY TEN MATCH IN MEDICAID

03:11:09.424 --> 03:11:10.892
THIS IS A MEDICAID.

03:11:10.959 --> 03:11:12.327
ENROLLMENT SYSTEM SO MEDICAID

03:11:12.394 --> 03:11:15.297
WOULD COVER ALL OF THOSE COSTS --

03:11:15.363 --> 03:11:17.432
OTHER NINETY TEN MATCH -- AND

03:11:17.499 --> 03:11:19.534
THEN IN WHEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED

03:11:19.601 --> 03:11:20.535
LET'S SAY IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN

03:11:20.602 --> 03:11:22.304
THE FINAL QUARTER OF THE BUDGET

03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:24.506
YEAR THAT WOULD BE COVERAGE FOR

03:11:24.573 --> 03:11:25.974
THOSE CHILDREN THAT OTHERWISE

03:11:26.041 --> 03:11:27.742

ABSOLUTELY MUST LOOK AT IF IF

03:17:49.757 --> 03:17:52.026
WE'RE GOING.

03:17:52.093 --> 03:17:53.394
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE THAT WE

03:17:53.461 --> 03:17:54.862

FOR MOST OF MEDI CAL POPULATION.

03:18:39.507 --> 03:18:40.575
IN ADDITION TO ADDING ADULTS

03:18:40.642 --> 03:18:42.110
UNDER AGE SIXTY FIVE WITH NO

PREVIOUS LINK TO THE PROGRAM WE

03:18:44.112 --> 03:18:45.446
ALSO IMPLEMENTED TO SYNC UP A

03:18:45.513 --> 03:18:46.781
SIMPLIFIED INCOME COUNTING ROLE

03:18:46.848 --> 03:18:48.182
BASED ON HOW AN INDIVIDUAL FILES

03:18:48.249 --> 03:18:49.150

03:18:49.217 --> 03:18:50.985
AND ELIMINATED THE ASSETS TEST

03:18:51.052 --> 03:18:51.819
OR THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY AND

OTHER RESOURCES YOU MAY HAVE AND

STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

03:18:55.056 --> 03:18:55.423
PROGRAM.

03:18:55.490 --> 03:18:57.692
HOWEVER ADULTS OVER AGE SIXTY

03:18:57.759 --> 03:18:58.493
FIVE IN MANY PERSONS WITH

03:18:58.559 --> 03:19:00.061
DISABILITIES ARE STILL SUBJECT

03:19:00.128 --> 03:19:01.629
TO THE OLD PROGRAM RULES.

03:19:01.696 --> 03:19:03.531
RULES THAT ARE BASED ON SSI

03:19:03.598 --> 03:19:05.099
ELIGIBILITY RULES.

03:19:05.166 --> 03:19:06.501
BY SIMPLIFYING THE INCOME

03:19:06.567 --> 03:19:08.136
DETERMINATION AND ELIMINATING

03:19:08.202 --> 03:19:09.337
THE ASSETS TEST COUNTIES ARE

03:19:09.404 --> 03:19:10.805
ABLE TO ADMINISTRATIVELY VERIFY

03:19:10.872 --> 03:19:12.774
ELIGIBILITY IT RE DETERMINATION

03:19:12.840 --> 03:19:14.008
FOR MANY RECIPIENTS UNDER THE

03:19:14.075 --> 03:19:16.077
NEW RULES BUT VERY FEW UNDER THE

03:19:16.144 --> 03:19:18.112
OLD RULES. FOR EXAMPLE IN

03:19:18.179 --> 03:19:20.315
SEPTEMBER THE MOST RECENT MONTH

03:19:20.381 --> 03:19:21.516
FOR WHICH WE HAVE DATA.

03:19:21.582 --> 03:19:22.884
LA COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVELY

03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:25.219
VERIFIED AT RENEWAL ALMOST A

03:19:25.286 --> 03:19:25.853
HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES USING THE

03:19:25.920 --> 03:19:27.755
NEW RULES BUT NO CASES OF

03:19:27.822 --> 03:19:28.856
INDIVIDUALS IN THE PROGRAM

03:19:28.923 --> 03:19:31.292
SERVING ADULTS OVER AGE SIXTY

03:19:31.359 --> 03:19:31.759
FIVE AND PERSONS WITH

03:19:31.826 --> 03:19:32.460
DISABILITIES.

03:19:32.527 --> 03:19:34.696
PRECISELY THOSE WERE MORE LIKELY

03:19:34.762 --> 03:19:39.500
TO LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME

03:19:39.567 --> 03:19:40.668
CREATION WE COULD DO A LOT MORE

03:19:40.735 --> 03:19:42.170
TO ALIGN THESE TWO SIDES OF THE

03:19:42.236 --> 03:19:44.305
MEDICARE PROGRAM [inaudible]

03:19:44.372 --> 03:19:46.541
HOWEVER.

03:19:46.607 --> 03:19:48.943
ABSENT THAT COOPERATION.

03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:50.211
THERE ARE STILL THINGS THAT

03:19:50.278 --> 03:19:52.213
CALIFORNIA CAN DO AS AUTHORIZED

03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:54.215
BY FEDERAL STATUTE ONE OF THEM

03:19:54.282 --> 03:19:55.917
AS YOU HEARD EARLIER IS RAISING

03:19:55.983 --> 03:19:57.819
THE INCOME TEST FOR OUR AT

03:19:57.885 --> 03:19:59.554
PEOPLE ON THE A AND D. PROGRAM.

03:19:59.620 --> 03:20:01.089
ANOTHER WOULD BE ELIMINATING A

03:20:01.155 --> 03:20:02.590
RAISING THE ASSETS LIMIT.

03:20:02.657 --> 03:20:04.592
AS WELL AS SIMPLIFYING THE RULES

03:20:04.659 --> 03:20:06.327
USED TO DETERMINE ASSETS.

03:20:06.394 --> 03:20:07.829
FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT STATES

03:20:07.895 --> 03:20:09.397
HAVE AN ASSET LIMIT THAT IT'S NO

03:20:09.464 --> 03:20:11.232
MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE LIMIT

03:20:11.299 --> 03:20:12.734
FOR SSI.

03:20:12.800 --> 03:20:14.635
FEDERAL GUIDANCE FROM CMS HAS

03:20:14.702 --> 03:20:15.703
CLARIFIED THAT THE NO MORE

03:20:15.770 --> 03:20:17.271
RESTRICTIVE TEST INCLUDES

03:20:17.338 --> 03:20:18.139
ELIMINATING ASSETS

03:20:18.206 --> 03:20:20.141
CONSIDERATIONS FOR SUMMER ALL OF

03:20:20.208 --> 03:20:21.909
THE PROGRAM'S COMPLETELY.

03:20:21.976 --> 03:20:24.078
WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS ADDED SOME

03:20:24.145 --> 03:20:26.314
EXCLUSIONS TO ITS ASSET LIMIT?

03:20:26.381 --> 03:20:28.383
AT THE OVERALL CAP JUST LIKE THE

03:20:28.449 --> 03:20:29.417
OVERALL.

03:20:29.484 --> 03:20:31.452
FEDERAL ASSET CAP FOR FED FOR

03:20:31.519 --> 03:20:33.588
SSI HAS REMOVED MADE AT TWO

03:20:33.654 --> 03:20:34.088
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN

03:20:34.155 --> 03:20:35.757
INDIVIDUAL OR THREE THOUSAND

03:20:35.823 --> 03:20:38.459
DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE SINCE.

03:20:38.526 --> 03:20:39.093
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE CURRENT

ASSET LIMIT PREVENT SENIORS AND

03:20:40.628 --> 03:20:41.896
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES FROM

03:20:41.963 --> 03:20:43.331
HAVING ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR

03:20:43.398 --> 03:20:44.799
WHETHER CRISIS SUCH AS AN

03:20:44.866 --> 03:20:46.801
EVICTION A LEAKING ROOF OR MAJOR

03:20:46.868 --> 03:20:48.936
VEHICLE REPAIR.

03:20:49.003 --> 03:20:50.304
THE INEQUITIES BETWEEN THE TWO

03:20:50.371 --> 03:20:51.372
SIDES OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM

03:20:51.439 --> 03:20:52.807
ARE HIGHLIGHTED AS MANY PEOPLE

03:20:52.874 --> 03:20:54.542
ARE NOW AGING INTO THIS PART OF

03:20:54.609 --> 03:20:56.310
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. ONE OF OUR

03:20:56.377 --> 03:20:57.545
PARTNERS REPORTED HELPING A

03:20:57.612 --> 03:20:59.013
WOMAN WHO LOST HER MEDI CAL WHEN

03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:00.581
SHE TURNED SIXTY FIVE BECAUSE

03:21:00.648 --> 03:21:01.949
SHE HAD AMASSED A SMALL AMOUNT

03:21:02.016 --> 03:21:03.451
OF SAVINGS TO PAY FOR TERMINALLY

03:21:03.518 --> 03:21:05.219
ILL HUSBANDS FUNERAL THAT SHE

03:21:05.286 --> 03:21:06.587
WAS UNWILLING TO GIVE UP.

03:21:06.654 --> 03:21:08.623
SURE REMAIN OFF MEDI CAL UNTIL

03:21:08.689 --> 03:21:10.725
SHE ACTUALLY SPENDS THAT MONEY.

03:21:10.792 --> 03:21:11.759
OTHER PART ANOTHER PARTNER

03:21:11.826 --> 03:21:13.261
REPORTS HELPING AN ELDERLY

03:21:13.327 --> 03:21:14.762
INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS EVICTED TO

03:21:14.829 --> 03:21:16.397
OBTAIN A RELOCATION FEE TO FIND

03:21:16.464 --> 03:21:17.532
A NEW APARTMENT.

03:21:17.598 --> 03:21:19.033
BUT BECAUSE HE WAS NOT ABLE TO

03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:20.601
IMMEDIATELY FIND A NEW PLACE HE

03:21:20.668 --> 03:21:22.870
HAD TO SPEND DOWN THE RELOCATION

03:21:22.937 --> 03:21:23.471
MONEY IN ORDER TO KEEP IS MEDI

03:21:23.538 --> 03:21:24.705
CAL.

03:21:24.772 --> 03:21:25.873
BECAUSE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE

03:21:25.940 --> 03:21:28.075
SO HIGH AND LOW INCOME SENIORS

03:21:28.142 --> 03:21:29.410
AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

03:21:29.477 --> 03:21:31.546
HAVE SO FEW ASSETS TO BEGIN WITH

03:21:31.612 --> 03:21:33.247
WHEN FACED WITH A MEDIC WITH THE

03:21:33.314 --> 03:21:35.183
OUTDATED MEDI CAL ASSET RULES.

03:21:35.249 --> 03:21:36.551
PEOPLE SIMPLY SPEND DOWN THEIR

03:21:36.617 --> 03:21:39.420
ASSETS OFTEN ON HEALTH CARE

03:21:39.487 --> 03:21:39.954
UNTIL THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR

03:21:40.021 --> 03:21:41.155
MEDICARE.

03:21:41.222 --> 03:21:41.856
THIS PUTS THEM AT RISK OF

03:21:41.923 --> 03:21:42.924
FURTHER INSTABILITY ARE

03:21:42.990 --> 03:21:44.592
HOMELESSNESS WHEN FINANCIAL

03:21:44.659 --> 03:21:45.927
CRISES HAPPEN.

03:21:45.993 --> 03:21:47.261
FURTHERMORE THESE RULES ALSO

03:21:47.328 --> 03:21:48.496
DISPROPORTIONATELY PUNISHED

03:21:48.563 --> 03:21:50.064
SENIORS OF COLOR BECAUSE THEY

03:21:50.131 --> 03:21:51.199
ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CASH

03:21:51.265 --> 03:21:52.800
STATE SAVINGS INSTEAD OF AN

03:21:52.867 --> 03:21:55.403
EXEMPT HOME. FOR EXAMPLE A LOW

03:21:55.470 --> 03:21:57.205
INCOME SENIOR WHO OWNS OUT RIGHT

03:21:57.271 --> 03:21:58.172
AN EXPENSIVE HOME IN THE BAY

03:21:58.239 --> 03:22:00.741
AREA CAN QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL.

03:22:00.808 --> 03:22:01.776
BUT A RENTER WITH THE SAME

03:22:01.843 --> 03:22:03.511
INCOME WOULD NOT GET MEDI CAL IF

03:22:03.578 --> 03:22:04.912
THEY HAD TWO THOUSAND AND ONE

03:22:04.979 --> 03:22:06.514
DOLLARS IN THE BANK.

03:22:06.581 --> 03:22:08.282
SYDNEY SIGNIFICANTLY RAISING THE

03:22:08.349 --> 03:22:09.484
MEDI CAL ASSET LIMIT WILL

03:22:09.550 --> 03:22:11.152
INCREASE FINANCIAL STABILITY SO

03:22:11.219 --> 03:22:12.820
SENIORS CAN SAVE FOR CRISIS AND

03:22:12.887 --> 03:22:14.522
DECREASE RACIAL INEQUALITY SAID

03:22:14.589 --> 03:22:16.524
SENIORS OF COLOR ARE PUNISHED

03:22:16.591 --> 03:22:17.058
FOR RACIAL DISPARITIES IN

03:22:17.124 --> 03:22:19.360
HOMEOWNERSHIP.

03:22:19.427 --> 03:22:23.164
ACCORDING TO A TWO HUNDRED AND

03:22:23.231 --> 03:22:23.798
TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

03:22:23.865 --> 03:22:25.399
STUDY BY THE BY THE KAISER

03:22:25.466 --> 03:22:27.502
FAMILY FOUNDATION. TWELVE STATES

03:22:27.568 --> 03:22:29.203
PLUS WASHINGTON DC RAISE THEIR

03:22:29.270 --> 03:22:30.404
ASSETS TEST AND SOME DID SO

03:22:30.471 --> 03:22:32.340
SIGNIFICANTLY IN SUMMER ALL OF

03:22:32.406 --> 03:22:33.875
THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAM SERVING

03:22:33.941 --> 03:22:34.942
SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH

03:22:35.009 --> 03:22:36.077
DISABILITIES.

03:22:36.143 --> 03:22:38.145
ARIZONA ELIMINATE AS ITS ASSETS

03:22:38.212 --> 03:22:39.547
TEST COMPLETELY TO SIMPLIFY

03:22:39.614 --> 03:22:41.315
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AFTER

03:22:41.382 --> 03:22:42.984
FINDING ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS

03:22:43.050 --> 03:22:44.619
LARGELY OFFSET BY ANY INCREASE

03:22:44.685 --> 03:22:45.987
ENROLLMENT.

03:22:46.053 --> 03:22:47.522
WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING THREE

03:22:47.588 --> 03:22:48.823
CHANGES WOULD DRASTICALLY

03:22:48.890 --> 03:22:50.925
DECREASE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF

03:22:50.992 --> 03:22:52.593
THE MEDICARE ASSETS TEST.

03:22:52.660 --> 03:22:54.629
FIRST WE SHOULD INCREASE THE

03:22:54.695 --> 03:22:56.597
OVERALL CAP ON ASSET SO PEOPLE

03:22:56.664 --> 03:22:58.099
CAN SAVE MONEY FOR EMERGENCIES

03:22:58.165 --> 03:22:59.634
AND INDEX IT SO IT GOES UP EVERY

03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:02.136
YEAR.

03:23:02.203 --> 03:23:04.438
SECOND SIMPLIFY THE EXISTING

03:23:04.505 --> 03:23:06.440
ASSETS EXCLUSIONS TO DECREASE

03:23:06.507 --> 03:23:08.242
THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF

03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:09.744
RENEWING MEDI CAL EVERY YEAR.

03:23:09.810 --> 03:23:11.045
MANY PEOPLE SUBJECT TO THE

03:23:11.112 --> 03:23:12.079
ASSETS TEST HAVE TO GET

03:23:12.146 --> 03:23:14.015
CONSIDERABLE HELP INTERPRETING

03:23:14.081 --> 03:23:15.650
FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS OR OBTAIN

03:23:15.716 --> 03:23:16.984
ASSESSMENTS ON LOW VALUE

03:23:17.051 --> 03:23:18.152
PROPERTIES IN ORDER TO KEEP

03:23:18.219 --> 03:23:19.220
THEIR MEDI CAL.

03:23:19.287 --> 03:23:20.788
WE THINK LARGER CATEGORIES OF

03:23:20.855 --> 03:23:23.658
ASSETS CAN BE EXCLUDED ENTIRELY.

03:23:23.724 --> 03:23:25.793
AND THIRD ELIMINATE THE ACID

03:23:25.860 --> 03:23:26.894
TEST ASK.

03:23:26.961 --> 03:23:28.963
ASSETS TEST FOR THE MEDICARE

03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:30.565
SAVINGS PROGRAM.

03:23:30.631 --> 03:23:32.033
THESE ARE PROGRAMS OR MEDI CAL

03:23:32.099 --> 03:23:34.135
JUST PAYS FOR THE MEDICARE COSTS

03:23:34.201 --> 03:23:35.570
RATHER THAN AND ROLLING THE

03:23:35.636 --> 03:23:37.238
INDIVIDUAL AND MEDIC HOUSE.

03:23:37.305 --> 03:23:39.206
SEVEN STATES PLUS DC HAVE GONE

03:23:39.273 --> 03:23:41.075
THIS ROUTE FOR SUMMER ALL OF

03:23:41.142 --> 03:23:42.543
THEIR MEDICAL SAVINGS PROGRAMS.

03:23:42.610 --> 03:23:44.111
BECAUSE THE STATE IS NOT ON THE

03:23:44.178 --> 03:23:45.613
HOOK FOR SOME OF THE MOST COSTLY

03:23:45.680 --> 03:23:47.815
EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH END OF

03:23:47.882 --> 03:23:49.183
LIFE CARE FOR THESE PROGRAMS.

03:23:49.250 --> 03:23:50.851
IT COULD BE AN IMPORTANT TESTING

03:23:50.918 --> 03:23:52.019
GROUND FOR A COST BENEFIT

03:23:52.086 --> 03:23:53.988
ANALYSIS AS WHETHER AN ASSET

03:23:54.055 --> 03:23:55.523
TEST CONTINUES TO MAKE SENSE AT

03:23:55.590 --> 03:23:56.157
ALL.

03:23:56.223 --> 03:23:57.224
WE SHOULD NOT AS A STATE

03:23:57.291 --> 03:23:59.026
SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTE THE VALUE

03:23:59.093 --> 03:24:00.294
OF SAVINGS WHILE PUNISHING THOSE

03:24:00.361 --> 03:24:02.096
WHO ATTEMPT TO SAVE BY TAKING

03:24:02.163 --> 03:24:03.564
AWAY THE ONLY HEALTH CARE THEY

03:24:03.631 --> 03:24:05.199
CAN AFFORD [inaudible]

03:24:05.266 --> 03:24:08.302
Q. [inaudible]

03:24:08.369 --> 03:24:12.273
THANK YOU.

03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:13.741
CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE SERVICES

03:24:13.808 --> 03:24:15.876
SO OBVIOUSLY NOT A PART OF THE

03:24:15.943 --> 03:24:17.612
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS NO SPECIFIC --

03:24:17.678 --> 03:24:19.213
POSITION ON IT I WOULD SAY FROM

03:24:19.280 --> 03:24:20.781
AN IMPLEMENTATION STANDPOINT WE

03:24:20.848 --> 03:24:22.817
CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THERE ARE

03:24:22.883 --> 03:24:24.118
FEDERAL AVENUES THAT WOULD

03:24:24.185 --> 03:24:25.419
PERMIT SOME OF THESE CHANGES

03:24:25.486 --> 03:24:26.921
WHETHER TO THIS DEGREE YOUR HOW

03:24:26.988 --> 03:24:27.855
MUCH I THINK.

03:24:27.922 --> 03:24:29.056
THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT HAVE

03:24:29.123 --> 03:24:30.224
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE EN

03:24:30.291 --> 03:24:32.627
MASSE -- THERE IS I WOULD SAY

03:24:32.693 --> 03:24:34.629
SOME SUBJECTIVITY ON THE CMS

03:24:34.695 --> 03:24:35.329
SIDE AS TO WHAT THEY COULD

03:24:35.396 --> 03:24:36.931
APPROVE AND SO WE WOULD HAVE TO

03:24:36.998 --> 03:24:38.466
WORK THROUGH THOSE AND AGAIN WE

03:24:38.532 --> 03:24:39.433
HAVE NOT HAD ANY OF THOSE

03:24:39.500 --> 03:24:41.068
CONVERSATIONS BUT IN ADDITION

03:24:41.135 --> 03:24:42.169
THAT OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE

03:24:42.236 --> 03:24:43.537
FISCAL COST FROM HAVING

03:24:43.604 --> 03:24:44.805
ADDITIONAL.

03:24:44.872 --> 03:24:46.340
PEOPLE ON THE PROGRAM THAT WE

03:24:46.407 --> 03:24:49.744
HAVE NOT HAD A FISCAL ANNOUNCES

03:24:49.810 --> 03:24:53.714
OF THAT DONE AT THIS POINT.

03:24:53.781 --> 03:24:55.316
QUESTIONS COME.

03:24:55.383 --> 03:24:56.250
TO THIS IS JUST GOING BY WHAT

03:24:56.317 --> 03:24:57.418
WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL LOGIC WITH

03:24:57.485 --> 03:24:59.420
THAT.

03:24:59.487 --> 03:25:01.088
ASSET TESTING YOUR OPINION.

03:25:01.155 --> 03:25:03.491
AT THAT TIME ALL PUBLIC PROGRAMS

03:25:03.557 --> 03:25:05.793
HAD AN ACID TEST -- MORE

03:25:05.860 --> 03:25:07.628
RECENTLY WE GOT RID OF THE ACID

03:25:07.695 --> 03:25:09.196
TEST FOR MOST OF THE MEDICARE

03:25:09.263 --> 03:25:11.699
PROGRAM -- IN ADDITION FOR OUR

03:25:11.766 --> 03:25:13.401
FOOD STAMPS PROGRAM CAO FRESH WE

03:25:13.467 --> 03:25:14.602
FUNCTIONALLY HAVE GOTTEN RID OF

03:25:14.669 --> 03:25:16.704
THE ASSETS TEST FOR ANYONE BELOW

03:25:16.771 --> 03:25:17.571
2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

03:25:17.638 --> 03:25:20.041
LEVEL -- THE LOGIC AT THAT TIME

03:25:20.107 --> 03:25:21.175
THOUGH WAS JUST MUCH MORE

03:25:21.242 --> 03:25:23.344
PUNITIVE ON WHO WAS ELIGIBLE FOR

03:25:23.411 --> 03:25:25.279
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND THE IDEA

03:25:25.346 --> 03:25:27.081
WAS THAT YOU NEVER WANTED

03:25:27.148 --> 03:25:29.150
ANYBODY WITH ANY SORT OF MEANS

03:25:29.216 --> 03:25:29.684
GETTING FOR THAT PUBLIC

03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:30.551
ASSISTANCE.

03:25:30.618 --> 03:25:31.919
WHEREAS NOW WE'VE MOVED TO

03:25:31.986 --> 03:25:33.587
LOOKING AT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AS

03:25:33.654 --> 03:25:34.755
A WAY TO HELPING FAMILIES

03:25:34.822 --> 03:25:37.692
STABILIZE AT TO HELPING PEOPLE

03:25:37.758 --> 03:25:39.427
ACTUALLY SUSTAIN THEMSELVES.

03:25:39.493 --> 03:25:42.163
I I ALWAYS SAID IF WE KIND OF

03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:43.764
SAID WE HAD AN ASSET TESTING FOR

03:25:43.831 --> 03:25:46.233
PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO PUT MONEY

03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:47.768
INTO A FIVE TWENTY NINE THE

03:25:47.835 --> 03:25:48.903
COUNTER PEOPLE WANT TO SAVE

03:25:48.969 --> 03:25:50.137
MONEY TO AN IRA I MEAN.

03:25:50.204 --> 03:25:51.605
YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE ANYBODY

03:25:51.672 --> 03:25:52.273
DOING THOSE THINGS BECAUSE IT'S

03:25:52.339 --> 03:25:54.909
SO SO DRACONIAN TO NOT ONLY HAVE

03:25:54.975 --> 03:25:56.944
THE TO DO AN ACID TEST BUT ALSO

03:25:57.011 --> 03:25:58.846
ALL THE PAPERWORK YOU HAVE TO

03:25:58.913 --> 03:25:59.547
FILL OUT SO.

03:25:59.613 --> 03:26:01.482
ON THIS SAME SORT OF LONG

03:26:01.549 --> 03:26:02.950
OVERDUE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE

03:26:03.017 --> 03:26:03.984
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN

03:26:04.051 --> 03:26:05.720
ORDER TO STREAMLINE STREAMLINE

03:26:05.786 --> 03:26:07.722
IT I THINK THERE ARE --

03:26:07.788 --> 03:26:11.325
REASONABLE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

03:26:11.392 --> 03:26:15.196
FISCAL FISCAL SITUATION BUT

03:26:15.262 --> 03:26:16.497
HAVING SAYS GIVING THAT YOU KNOW

03:26:16.564 --> 03:26:17.331
THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY HIGH

03:26:17.398 --> 03:26:20.668
LEVELS OF POVERTY IN OUR STATE.

03:26:20.735 --> 03:26:21.602
KNOWING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

03:26:21.669 --> 03:26:23.104
THAT IF THEY'RE NOT ON THAT

03:26:23.170 --> 03:26:24.004
ACCOUNT MAYBE THEY'RE DOING

03:26:24.071 --> 03:26:25.573
OTHER THINGS LIKE GOING INTO THE

03:26:25.639 --> 03:26:27.141
EMERGENCY ROOM OR THEY'RE NOT.

03:26:27.208 --> 03:26:27.908
THEY'RE NOT OUT COOLEY TAKING

03:26:27.975 --> 03:26:29.210
CARE OF THEMSELVES WE HAVE TO

03:26:29.276 --> 03:26:30.845
PICK UP THE COST SOMEWHERE ELSE

03:26:30.911 --> 03:26:32.379
IT SEEMS LIKE.

03:26:32.446 --> 03:26:33.748
ON WALL THAT MIGHT.

03:26:33.814 --> 03:26:34.682
BE AN INCREASE IN COST OF

03:26:34.749 --> 03:26:36.884
MEDICAL AYE IT'S PROBABLY BETTER

03:26:36.951 --> 03:26:38.652
FOR THE OVERALL HEALTH.

03:26:38.719 --> 03:26:39.820
HEALTH OF THE STATE.

03:26:39.887 --> 03:26:41.122
MY ONE QUESTION WAS DO YOU DO

03:26:41.188 --> 03:26:43.524
YOU FEEL LIKE THE PROPOSAL AND

03:26:43.591 --> 03:26:46.127
MISS CAREERS BUILD THE TEN

03:26:46.193 --> 03:26:46.660
THOUSAND FIVE DOLLARS IT'S

03:26:46.727 --> 03:26:51.932
REALLY HIGH ENOUGH GIVEN THE

03:26:51.999 --> 03:26:53.634
HUGE COST OF LIVING.

03:26:53.701 --> 03:26:55.870
IN THE STATE YOU KNOW LIKE TEN

03:26:55.936 --> 03:26:57.371
pYOU KNOW I MEAN A GOOD CHUNK OF

03:26:57.438 --> 03:26:58.139
THAT COULD EVEN BE FIRST AND

03:26:58.205 --> 03:26:58.773
LAST MONTH'S RENT DEPENDING ON

03:26:58.839 --> 03:27:00.474
WHERE YOU WORKED WHICH PART OF

03:27:00.541 --> 03:27:01.876
THE STATE YOU'RE RENTING IT.

03:27:01.942 --> 03:27:03.544
WE WOULD LIKE TO LEMONADE

03:27:03.611 --> 03:27:04.411
ENTIRELY.

03:27:04.478 --> 03:27:06.347
IF I'M HONEST -- WITH WHICH YOU

03:27:06.413 --> 03:27:07.314
CAN'T DO BUT THE QUESTIONS ARE

03:27:07.381 --> 03:27:09.016
JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU CHOSE THIS

03:27:09.083 --> 03:27:10.251
TWO NUMBERS WELL EITHER.

03:27:10.317 --> 03:27:11.952
TAKING IN CONSIDERATION WITH THE

03:27:12.019 --> 03:27:13.487
OTHER PIECES OF THE PROPOSAL

03:27:13.554 --> 03:27:14.955
THAT ARE EXCLUDING BROAD

03:27:15.022 --> 03:27:17.258
CATEGORIES RETIRE EARLY -- SO

03:27:17.324 --> 03:27:18.159
FOR EXAMPLE YOU BROUGHT UP

03:27:18.225 --> 03:27:20.094
RETIREMENT RIGHT NOW RETIREMENT

03:27:20.161 --> 03:27:21.629
IS OFTEN EXCLUDED BUT IT DEPENDS

03:27:21.695 --> 03:27:22.596
IF YOU'RE TAKING THE

03:27:22.663 --> 03:27:24.064
DISBURSEMENTS AND A LOT OF OUR

03:27:24.131 --> 03:27:25.199
LOW INCOME CONSUMERS ARE

03:27:25.266 --> 03:27:26.734
HESITANT TO TAKE DISBURSEMENTS

03:27:26.801 --> 03:27:28.235
WHEN THEY HAVE A VERY TINY.

03:27:28.302 --> 03:27:29.804
RETIREMENT BUCKET TO BEGIN WITH

03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:31.972
SO WE PROPOSE EXCLUDING ENTIRELY

03:27:32.039 --> 03:27:32.940
AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS LIKE

03:27:33.007 --> 03:27:34.408
LIFE INSURANCE POLICIESWE

03:27:34.475 --> 03:27:36.811
PROPOSE ENTIRELY -- BUT WE WOULD

03:27:36.877 --> 03:27:39.880
NOT BE OPPOSED TO ANY PROPOSAL

03:27:39.947 --> 03:27:42.349
THAT RAISES IT EVEN FURTHER.

03:27:42.416 --> 03:27:43.450
GREAT THANK YOU I MAKE IT JUST

03:27:43.517 --> 03:27:44.485
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IF WE

03:27:44.552 --> 03:27:47.855
ACTUALLY -- WANT BETTER PUBLIC

03:27:47.922 --> 03:27:49.924
HEALTH WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE

03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:51.625
INSURED AND AND THIS SEEMS TO

03:27:51.692 --> 03:27:53.127
HAVE COUNTER INTUITIVE TO KEEP

03:27:53.194 --> 03:27:54.195
THEM.

03:27:54.261 --> 03:27:55.729
KEEP THEM OFF MEDI CAL AND I

03:27:55.796 --> 03:27:56.297
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY

03:27:56.363 --> 03:27:57.097
COMMENTS FOR THE YOU KNOW I MEAN

03:27:57.164 --> 03:27:59.233
I AGAIN I THINK -- OBVIOUSLY AT

03:27:59.300 --> 03:28:00.134
THE END THE DAY AT THE DECISION

03:28:00.201 --> 03:28:01.335
THAT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE AS

03:28:01.402 --> 03:28:02.937
PART OF THE BUDGET I THINK WHERE

03:28:03.003 --> 03:28:05.072
I JUST COME IN AT THE CAUTION IS.

03:28:05.139 --> 03:28:07.074
HOW WHAT THE A MESSAGE RESPONSE

03:28:07.141 --> 03:28:08.042
WOULD BE ON WHAT'S REASONABLE

03:28:08.108 --> 03:28:09.310
AND HOW DO WE DEMONSTRATE WHAT'S

03:28:09.376 --> 03:28:10.778
APPROPRIATE AND SO THAT'S JUST

03:28:10.845 --> 03:28:12.046
WHERE WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT

03:28:12.112 --> 03:28:13.447
CONVERSATION SO I?

03:28:13.514 --> 03:28:14.915
I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER CMOS

03:28:14.982 --> 03:28:16.750
WOULD BE FINE WITH THIS OR

03:28:16.817 --> 03:28:17.818
SOMETHING HIGHER SOMETHING LOWER

03:28:17.885 --> 03:28:19.320
I THINK YOU KNOW THEY'RE

03:28:19.386 --> 03:28:20.020
PROBABLY ONLY A COUPLE FEET THAT

03:28:20.087 --> 03:28:21.055
HAVE.

03:28:21.121 --> 03:28:22.489
AROUND THESE TYPES OF LEVELS --

03:28:22.556 --> 03:28:24.325
NEW YORK BEING ONE OF THEM --

03:28:24.391 --> 03:28:26.093
THAT IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN

03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:26.994
THAT WHAT'S PROPOSED IN THE BILL

03:28:27.061 --> 03:28:28.629
BUT IT MOST STATES ARE AROUND

03:28:28.696 --> 03:28:29.797
OUR LEVEL SO IT'S JUST THAT

03:28:29.864 --> 03:28:30.965
CONVERSATION WITH THE FEDERAL

03:28:31.031 --> 03:28:32.466
GOVERNMENT AND WHAT SUBJECTIVITY

03:28:32.533 --> 03:28:33.667
THEY HAVE AN APPROVING SOMETHING

03:28:33.734 --> 03:28:33.968
LIKE THAT.

03:28:34.034 --> 03:28:36.003
IN IN THEIR ONLY RESTRICTIONS AT

03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:37.204
THAT WE HAVE A LIMIT THEY DID

03:28:37.271 --> 03:28:38.739
THEY DO THEY HAVE SAID AFTER

03:28:38.806 --> 03:28:40.241
PROVE OUR LIMIT AB SURVEY DO SO

03:28:40.307 --> 03:28:42.643
ANY CHANGE IN OUR PROPOSED ASSET

03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:44.345
LIMITS IN ANY EXEMPTIONS ARE ALL

03:28:44.411 --> 03:28:46.347
REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH A FEDERAL

03:28:46.413 --> 03:28:46.747
APPROVAL PROCESS.

03:28:46.814 --> 03:28:51.318
THAT WAS BEFORE.

03:28:51.385 --> 03:28:53.520
ALWAYS FIND.

03:28:53.587 --> 03:28:53.721
OKAY.

03:28:53.787 --> 03:28:54.588
I I I THINK THAT WE WHATEVER WE

03:28:54.655 --> 03:28:55.823
COULD DO TO I THINK SUPPORT YOUR

03:28:55.890 --> 03:28:57.558
EFFORTS IT WOULD BE GOOD -- TO

03:28:57.625 --> 03:28:59.560
GET FROM FINANCE SOME ESTIMATES

03:28:59.627 --> 03:29:02.496
OF COSTS EVEN WITH THIS AYE AYE

03:29:02.563 --> 03:29:04.298
SOMEONE TO GO TO THIS BILL YOU

START TO GET SOME.

03:29:05.199 --> 03:29:06.533
THAT'S NO COST BUT WOULD BE GOOD

03:29:06.600 --> 03:29:08.903
SO THAT WE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND

03:29:08.969 --> 03:29:10.771
THAT OF SARS FINANCE COMING UP.

03:29:10.838 --> 03:29:12.873
MY GOD GOOD.

VISION A WORKLOAD WERE HAPPY TO

03:29:25.152 --> 03:29:26.520
WORK WITH YOUR STAFF ON A

03:29:26.587 --> 03:29:28.222
PARTICIPATION APPROACH ON ON

THANK YOU.

03:29:31.225 --> 03:29:33.494
ON THE ESTIMATES I MEAN WE DON'T

HAVE AN ESTIMATE TO PUT ON THE

03:29:35.195 --> 03:29:35.729
TABLE EITHER BUT OUR AREAS OF

03:29:35.796 --> 03:29:37.231
WORKING WITH CLIENTS WHEN WE

03:29:37.298 --> 03:29:38.499
TELL THEM THEY CAN HAVE MEDI CAL

03:29:38.565 --> 03:29:40.467
OR THEY CAN HAVE -- AMOUNT OF

03:29:40.534 --> 03:29:41.902
ASSETS OVER THE LIMIT.

03:29:41.969 --> 03:29:43.504
THEY GET RID OF THOSE ASSETS AND

03:29:43.570 --> 03:29:45.739
GO ON MEDI CAL -- IT'S JUST

03:29:45.806 --> 03:29:47.608
NORMAL LOW INCOME PEOPLE CAN

03:29:47.675 --> 03:29:48.876
AFFORD HEALTHCARE YEAH AND AGAIN

03:29:48.943 --> 03:29:50.110
THAT WHICH IS WHICH IS LIKE A

03:29:50.177 --> 03:29:51.946
HORRIBLE DECISION.

03:29:52.012 --> 03:29:52.546
BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THEY ARE

03:29:52.613 --> 03:29:53.447
PUTTING.

03:29:53.514 --> 03:29:54.982
THEIR FAMILIES AT MUCH GREATER

03:29:55.049 --> 03:29:56.483
RISK RIGHT IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT

BOTH WHAT WHAT ARE THE EFFORTS

03:31:15.863 --> 03:31:17.231
REQUIRED ON OUR SIDE BUT REALLY

03:31:17.297 --> 03:31:18.799
SORT OF WHAT'S THE EFFORT ON THE

03:31:18.866 --> 03:31:20.134
FEDERAL SIDE AND IF THEY HAVE A

03:31:20.200 --> 03:31:21.835
LOT OF CONCERNS OR ISSUES

03:31:21.902 --> 03:31:24.004
TYPICALLY THE DOING ADDITIONAL

03:31:24.071 --> 03:31:27.074
QUESTIONS IS A IS A METHOD FOR

03:31:27.141 --> 03:31:28.776
DELAYING THE IMPLEMENTATION.

03:31:28.842 --> 03:31:30.077
DO YOU GENERALLY SEE THE

03:31:30.144 --> 03:31:31.912
QUESTIONS A COME BACK OR A

03:31:31.979 --> 03:31:32.846
MATTER OF JUST TRYING TO BE

03:31:32.913 --> 03:31:34.181
RELEVANT OR ARE THEY ACTUALLY

03:31:34.248 --> 03:31:36.650
AFFECT FACTUAL QUESTIONS FOR ME

03:31:36.717 --> 03:31:38.285
OR THEY JUST WANT TO PROLONG.

03:31:38.352 --> 03:31:39.620
THE BUREAUCRACY BECAUSE I MEAN

03:31:39.686 --> 03:31:42.156
THIS IS THIS IS AFFECTING

03:31:42.222 --> 03:31:42.890
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

03:31:42.956 --> 03:31:44.525
BUT AGAIN I WOULD SAY IT VARIES

03:31:44.591 --> 03:31:46.160
I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE

03:31:46.226 --> 03:31:49.129
ISSUE -- AND HAVING NOT

03:31:49.196 --> 03:31:50.764

VIEWPOINT IS OR WHETHER.

03:31:57.838 --> 03:31:59.273
THE PROCESS WOULD BE COMPLICATED

03:31:59.339 --> 03:32:01.708

TAKEN SOMETIMES IT'S JUST THAT

03:32:11.085 --> 03:32:13.153

03:36:39.686 --> 03:36:41.088
STREAMS OF WORK THAT ARE BEING

03:36:41.154 --> 03:36:42.589
DONE PURSUANT TO THE GOVERNOR'S

03:36:42.656 --> 03:36:45.459

03:36:45.525 --> 03:36:47.294
IS UNDER WAY WITH THE DEPARTMENT

03:36:47.361 --> 03:36:49.262
OF GENERAL SERVICES AROUND THE

03:36:49.329 --> 03:36:52.165
BOOK PURCHASE SEEN -- AND FOR

03:36:52.232 --> 03:36:53.967
FOLKS THAT ARE NOT AS FAMILIAR

03:36:54.034 --> 03:36:54.568
WITH.

03:36:54.634 --> 03:36:56.937
HOW WE AND DDS ARE VERY

03:36:57.003 --> 03:36:58.805
DIFFERENT -- I LIKE TO EXPLAIN

03:36:58.872 --> 03:37:00.741
IT IN SIMPLE TERMS AND THAT TGS

03:37:00.807 --> 03:37:02.509
PURCHASES DRUGS FOR

03:37:02.576 --> 03:37:04.244
INSTITUTIONALIZED POPULATIONS

03:37:04.311 --> 03:37:06.413
AND SO IF YOU ARE A JAIL A

03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:08.014
COUNTY JAIL OR DEPARTMENT OF

03:37:08.081 --> 03:37:08.982
CORRECTIONS OR DEPARTMENT OF

03:37:09.049 --> 03:37:11.251
STATE HOSPITALS OR ONE OF THOSE

03:37:11.318 --> 03:37:12.786
STATE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS --

03:37:12.853 --> 03:37:14.755
YOU WORK WITH THE GS TO PURCHASE

03:37:14.821 --> 03:37:16.390
A CERTAIN KIND OF DRUG IN A

03:37:16.456 --> 03:37:17.724
CERTAIN AMOUNT THEY GO THEY

03:37:17.791 --> 03:37:19.493
NEGOTIATE THE CONTRACT BUT THEY

03:37:19.559 --> 03:37:20.594
DELIVER THE DRUG TO THAT

03:37:20.660 --> 03:37:22.763
INSTITUTIONAL FACILITY AND IT'S

03:37:22.829 --> 03:37:23.397
DISTRIBUTED TO PATIENTS

03:37:23.463 --> 03:37:26.400
ACCORDINGLY -- AS A PAYER --SO

03:37:26.466 --> 03:37:27.834
IN TERMS OF HOW MEDI CAL

03:37:27.901 --> 03:37:30.871
OPERATES WE DON'T PURCHASE DRUGS --

03:37:30.937 --> 03:37:34.107
AS A AS A HARD AS YOU KNOW KIND

03:37:34.174 --> 03:37:37.477
OF COST IS WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE

03:37:37.544 --> 03:37:39.379
AGREEMENTS WITH MANUFACTURERS --

03:37:39.446 --> 03:37:40.714
A PATIENT WILL GET A SCRIPT FROM

03:37:40.781 --> 03:37:41.948
A PHYSICIAN THEY WILL GO TO A

03:37:42.015 --> 03:37:43.383
PHARMACY THE PHARMACY WILL FILL

03:37:43.450 --> 03:37:45.118
THE PRESCRIPTION WE REIMBURSE

03:37:45.185 --> 03:37:46.286
THE PHARMACY BOTH THE

03:37:46.353 --> 03:37:47.354
ACQUISITION COST IN THE

03:37:47.421 --> 03:37:49.823
DISPENSING FEE -- WE HAVE TWO

03:37:49.890 --> 03:37:51.124
KINDS OF REBATES THAT WE

03:37:51.191 --> 03:37:54.394
NEGOTIATE -- ONE IS A FEDERALLY

03:37:54.461 --> 03:37:57.030
MANDATED REBATE FOR ALL DRUGS

03:37:57.097 --> 03:37:58.565
BOTH FEE FOR SERVICE AND MEDI

03:37:58.632 --> 03:37:59.900
CAL MANAGED CARE.

03:37:59.966 --> 03:38:01.034
AND THEN WE AS A STATE HAVE

03:38:01.101 --> 03:38:02.569
NEGOTIATED SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE

03:38:02.636 --> 03:38:04.504
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WITH

03:38:04.571 --> 03:38:06.440
MANUFACTURERS IN FEE FOR SERVICE

03:38:06.506 --> 03:38:10.043
AND SO ANY DRUG THAT IS SOLD --

03:38:10.110 --> 03:38:12.078
IN A CALIFORNIA PHARMACY -- AND

03:38:12.145 --> 03:38:13.447
WE HAVEN'T SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE

03:38:13.513 --> 03:38:15.248
IN PLACE WE GET IT AN ADDITIONAL

03:38:15.315 --> 03:38:16.450
AMOUNT OF FUNDING ABOVE AND

03:38:16.516 --> 03:38:19.186
BEYOND WHAT THE MANDATED FEDERAL

03:38:19.252 --> 03:38:21.755
REQUIREMENTS ARE -- I THINK ONE

03:38:21.822 --> 03:38:23.223
OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS

03:38:23.290 --> 03:38:25.459
OF HAVING A PRESCRIPTION DRUG

03:38:25.525 --> 03:38:27.661
DISCUSSIONS IS THE THE WAY THE

03:38:27.727 --> 03:38:30.997
PRICING WORKS -- EACH PURCHASER

03:38:31.064 --> 03:38:32.666
HAS DIFFERENT APRES SAYS THAT

03:38:32.732 --> 03:38:34.301
THEY CAN NEGOTIATE -- A LOT OF

03:38:34.367 --> 03:38:36.236
THOSE ARE -- OBVIOUSLY

03:38:36.303 --> 03:38:38.839
CONFIDENTIAL AND THEN -- AS YOUR

03:38:38.905 --> 03:38:40.874
AGENDA NOTES WE GET SIGNIFICANT --

03:38:40.941 --> 03:38:42.976
MANDATORY REBATES -- AND SOME

03:38:43.043 --> 03:38:45.312
SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES -- FOR THE

03:38:45.378 --> 03:38:46.780
PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE.

03:38:46.847 --> 03:38:48.515
WHEN THE GOVERNOR I SIGNED THE%

03:38:48.582 --> 03:38:51.785
EXECUTIVE ORDER -- WE HAVE TO

03:38:51.852 --> 03:38:53.653
SEPARATE WORK STREAMS ON TOP OF

03:38:53.720 --> 03:38:55.355
WHAT THE WORK IS THAT TGS IS

03:38:55.422 --> 03:38:57.757
CURRENTLY DOING ONE OF WHICH IS

03:38:57.824 --> 03:38:59.759
AN INITIAL FIRST STEP TO CARVE

03:38:59.826 --> 03:39:02.629
OUT -- THE PHARMACY BENEFIT FROM

03:39:02.696 --> 03:39:03.864
OUR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS

03:39:03.930 --> 03:39:05.232
AND RETURN IT AS A FEE FOR

03:39:05.298 --> 03:39:06.333
SERVICE BENEFIT.

03:39:06.399 --> 03:39:08.301
THE SECOND WORKSTREAM WAS TO

03:39:08.368 --> 03:39:10.704
LOOK ACROSS NOT ONLY OUR PROGRAM

03:39:10.770 --> 03:39:13.039
BUT ACROSS ALL PURCHASERS ALL

03:39:13.106 --> 03:39:14.241
PEERS IN CALIFORNIA.

03:39:14.307 --> 03:39:17.143
ALL PROGRAMS UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:39:17.210 --> 03:39:19.779
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT

03:39:19.846 --> 03:39:22.249
WE AS A STATE CAN USE OUR

03:39:22.315 --> 03:39:23.950
ECONOMIC LEVERAGE SO TO SPEAK TO

03:39:24.017 --> 03:39:26.553
DRIVE LOWER DRUG PRICES I THINK --

03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:28.555
WE WOULD NOT WANT TO SAY THAT

03:39:28.622 --> 03:39:30.090
JUST GETTING -- SAVINGS AND

03:39:30.156 --> 03:39:32.092
MEDIC COW IS ENOUGH -- FROM THE

03:39:32.158 --> 03:39:33.593
STANDPOINT THAT WE ARE A VERY

03:39:33.660 --> 03:39:35.462
KIND OF UNIQUE PURCHASER BECAUSE

03:39:35.529 --> 03:39:36.863
OF OUR FEDERAL AND STATE

03:39:36.930 --> 03:39:38.532
PROTECTIONS AROUND REBATES AND

03:39:38.598 --> 03:39:40.000
MEDICAID BEST PRICE.

03:39:40.066 --> 03:39:41.301
SO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE

03:39:41.368 --> 03:39:43.036
ORDER IS REALLY CHALLENGING US

03:39:43.103 --> 03:39:44.237
TO WORK ACROSS THE DIFFERENT

03:39:44.304 --> 03:39:46.806
DEPARTMENTS -- TO COME UP WITH

03:39:46.873 --> 03:39:48.742
RECOMMENDATIONS TO LOWER DRUG

03:39:48.808 --> 03:39:51.177
PRICES NOT ONLY FOR OUR PROGRAM

03:39:51.244 --> 03:39:52.512
BUT FOR OTHER PURCHASERS

03:39:52.579 --> 03:39:54.514
INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS

03:39:54.581 --> 03:39:55.916
AND THE STATE AND SO THAT IS A

03:39:55.982 --> 03:39:58.218
SEPARATE -- AND DISTINCT PART OF

03:39:58.285 --> 03:39:59.719
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WERE

03:39:59.786 --> 03:40:02.856
ALSO WORKING ON FOR PURPOSES OF

03:40:02.923 --> 03:40:05.759
THE AGENDA AND THE QUESTIONS --

03:40:05.825 --> 03:40:07.661
FOR THE CAR ABOUT -- OF THE

03:40:07.727 --> 03:40:09.629
PHARMACY BENEFIT FROM THE

03:40:09.696 --> 03:40:11.932
MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS --

03:40:11.998 --> 03:40:15.268
THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE --

03:40:15.335 --> 03:40:16.169
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR

03:40:16.236 --> 03:40:20.073
THIS THE FIRST IS -- WE HAVE --

03:40:20.140 --> 03:40:23.176
REALLY -- STRONG INTENTION OF

03:40:23.243 --> 03:40:24.411
STANDARDIZING THE MEDICAL

03:40:24.477 --> 03:40:26.613
BENEFIT ACROSS THE MANAGED CARE

03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:29.049
MARKET SO WE HAVE -- WAIVERS

03:40:29.115 --> 03:40:31.818
THAT ARE COMING DUE AND TWENTY

03:40:31.885 --> 03:40:32.919
TWENTY A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT

03:40:32.986 --> 03:40:34.921
WE AS A STATE PROGRAM WOULD LIKE

03:40:34.988 --> 03:40:36.856
TO DO AS IT TURNED AS IT --

03:40:36.923 --> 03:40:38.858
TALKS ABOUT WHOLE PERSON CARE

03:40:38.925 --> 03:40:39.626
AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF

03:40:39.693 --> 03:40:41.761
INITIATIVES IT REALLY REQUIRES

03:40:41.828 --> 03:40:43.330
US TO STANDARDIZE THE BENEFIT --

03:40:43.396 --> 03:40:46.633
IN A WAY THAT WE CAN START TO DO

03:40:46.700 --> 03:40:47.734
MORE REGIONALI STRAIGHT AND

03:40:47.801 --> 03:40:48.435
SIMPLIFY SOME OF OUR RATE

03:40:48.501 --> 03:40:48.702
SETTING.

03:40:48.768 --> 03:40:49.903
BY PULLING OUT THE PHARMACY

03:40:49.970 --> 03:40:51.471
BENEFIT AND STANDARDIZING NOT

03:40:51.538 --> 03:40:53.306
ACROSS THE MARKET THAT ACHIEVE

03:40:53.373 --> 03:40:55.241
CERTAINLY THAT GOAL -- AS IT

03:40:55.308 --> 03:40:57.344
PERTAINS DIRECTLY TO THE

03:40:57.410 --> 03:40:59.613
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER -- WE

03:40:59.679 --> 03:41:00.914
ONLY RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL

03:41:00.981 --> 03:41:03.083
REBATES ON THE FEE FOR SERVICE

03:41:03.149 --> 03:41:04.718
POPULATION TODAY WHICH HAS

03:41:04.784 --> 03:41:06.786
DRAMATICALLY SHRUNK -- IN SOME

03:41:06.853 --> 03:41:09.489
CASES -- DOWN TO VERY SMALL

03:41:09.556 --> 03:41:11.758
POPULATIONS -- ELIGIBLE FOR FULL

03:41:11.825 --> 03:41:13.660
SCOPE BENEFITS A LOT OF OUR FEE

03:41:13.727 --> 03:41:15.695
FOR SERVICE POPULATION ARE THOSE

03:41:15.762 --> 03:41:17.197
THAT ARE ON RESTRICTED SCOPE --

03:41:17.263 --> 03:41:19.499
MEDI CAL WITH ONLY ACCESS TO

03:41:19.566 --> 03:41:21.568
EMERGENCY SERVICES -- THE OTHER

03:41:21.635 --> 03:41:23.670
POPULATION THE OTHER LARGEST

03:41:23.737 --> 03:41:25.472
POPULATION FEE FOR SERVICE ARE

03:41:25.538 --> 03:41:28.541
DUAL ELIGIBLES -- I FEEL REALLY

03:41:28.608 --> 03:41:30.844
OLD WHEN I TALK ABOUT -- LOOKING

03:41:30.910 --> 03:41:34.114
BACK ON TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN WE

03:41:34.180 --> 03:41:35.815
SAW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

03:41:35.882 --> 03:41:37.784
MEDICARE PART D. BENEFIT AND ON

03:41:37.851 --> 03:41:39.686
A SINGLE DAY APPROXIMATELY A

03:41:39.753 --> 03:41:41.721
MILLION DUAL ELIGIBLES HAD THEIR

03:41:41.788 --> 03:41:42.989
COVERAGE CHANGE FROM OUR

03:41:43.056 --> 03:41:44.758
PHARMACY BENEFIT AS A STATE

03:41:44.824 --> 03:41:46.026
MEDICAID PROGRAM.

03:41:46.092 --> 03:41:47.527
OVER TO THE MEDICARE PART D.

03:41:47.594 --> 03:41:49.763
BENEFIT IN WHICH A LOT OF BEEN

03:41:49.829 --> 03:41:51.765
FISHERIES HAD NO UNDERSTANDING

03:41:51.831 --> 03:41:53.533
OF HOW WHICH PLAN THEY WERE IN

03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:56.403
ROLLED AND HOW DID THEIR DRUG

03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:56.670
PLAN WORK.

03:41:56.736 --> 03:41:57.537
AND SO.

03:41:57.604 --> 03:41:59.172
I'M A LOT OF OUR RESIDUAL FEE

03:41:59.239 --> 03:42:00.540
FOR SERVICE POPULATION IS REALLY

03:42:00.607 --> 03:42:01.841
NOT GENERATING THE SAME KINDS OF

03:42:01.908 --> 03:42:03.143
SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES THAT IT

03:42:03.209 --> 03:42:05.345
ONCE DID AND I THINK -- PART OF

03:42:05.412 --> 03:42:06.646
THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER

03:42:06.713 --> 03:42:08.815
IS CERTAINLY -- IN THE SHORT

03:42:08.882 --> 03:42:10.650
TERM INTERESTED IN RETURNING

03:42:10.717 --> 03:42:12.419
THAT THIRTEEN MILLION MEMBER

03:42:12.485 --> 03:42:14.220
POPULATION INTO FEE FOR SERVICE

03:42:14.287 --> 03:42:16.389
SO THAT WE CAN BE -- KIND OF

03:42:16.456 --> 03:42:17.724
GENERATING AND RECEIVING THE

03:42:17.791 --> 03:42:18.925
FULL LEVERAGE OF THOSE

03:42:18.992 --> 03:42:20.694
SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES THAT WE

03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:22.162
OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE TODAY.

03:42:22.228 --> 03:42:23.897
AND THEN LASTLY I THINK THAT

03:42:23.963 --> 03:42:25.965
WHEN WE LOOK AT DRUG PRICES ALL

03:42:26.032 --> 03:42:27.500
TOGETHER WE ARE DEPARTMENT THAT

03:42:27.567 --> 03:42:29.369
SPENDS APPROXIMATELY TWELVE

03:42:29.436 --> 03:42:30.570
BILLION DOLLARS.

03:42:30.637 --> 03:42:32.906
IN PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS A YEAR --

03:42:32.972 --> 03:42:34.407
COMBINED ACROSS MANAGED CARE AND

03:42:34.474 --> 03:42:36.509
FEE FOR SERVICE AND CERTAINLY TO

03:42:36.576 --> 03:42:38.411
THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN --

03:42:38.478 --> 03:42:40.346
EXTRICATE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS IN

03:42:40.413 --> 03:42:43.717
THAT AREA IT OBVIOUSLY HAS -- IF

03:42:43.783 --> 03:42:45.185
THOSE ARE BIG DOLLARS AND SO ANY

03:42:45.251 --> 03:42:46.753
SPUR CENTERS THAT WE CAN SAVE A

03:42:46.820 --> 03:42:48.755
CERTAINLY -- SIGNIFICANT FROM

03:42:48.822 --> 03:42:50.290
BOTH A SHORT TERM IN A LONG TERM

03:42:50.356 --> 03:42:52.058
GOAL GOING FORWARD SO WITH THAT

03:42:52.125 --> 03:42:53.626
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

03:42:53.693 --> 03:42:55.195
BUT THOSE ARE THOSE THE EFFORTS

03:42:55.261 --> 03:42:56.863
THAT WERE UNDER WAY WITH THE

03:42:56.930 --> 03:42:58.398
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER.

03:42:58.465 --> 03:43:01.434
THANK YOU.

03:43:01.501 --> 03:43:03.136
THANK YOU VERY HAS A LITTLE.

03:43:03.203 --> 03:43:05.338
AND YOU WANT TO PRESENT

03:43:05.405 --> 03:43:05.638
[inaudible]

03:43:05.705 --> 03:43:07.273
ALRIGHT.

03:43:07.340 --> 03:43:08.575
HI JENNY HANDLES ELIGIBILITY

03:43:08.641 --> 03:43:09.743
I'LL I'LL TAKE.

03:43:09.809 --> 03:43:10.443
ALL RIGHT [inaudible]

03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:15.682
IS -- JENNY -- WELL ABOVE THE

03:43:15.749 --> 03:43:17.150
COVER FOR DAILY YEAH HUNDRED

03:43:17.217 --> 03:43:17.784
GUESS YOU LET SOMEONE TAKE AS

03:43:17.851 --> 03:43:19.219
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

03:43:19.285 --> 03:43:20.487
SO WE DO KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL

03:43:20.553 --> 03:43:23.490
DOESN'T HAVE A FISCAL IMACT IN --

03:43:23.556 --> 03:43:24.557
NINETEEN TWENTY DAMAGE AT THAT

03:43:24.624 --> 03:43:25.625
MINISTRATION IS WORKING ON

03:43:25.692 --> 03:43:27.594

ANALYST'S OFFICE WE LAST WEEK WE

03:43:49.949 --> 03:43:52.786
RELEASED A REPORT ANALYZING THE

03:43:52.852 --> 03:43:54.320
CARVE OUT OF PHARMACY SERVICES

03:43:54.387 --> 03:43:56.689
WITHIN MEDI CAL AND WE FOUND

03:43:56.756 --> 03:43:58.358
THAT -- THE CAR ABOUT WOULD

03:43:58.424 --> 03:44:00.727
LIKELY RESULT IN SAVINGS FOR THE

03:44:00.794 --> 03:44:02.328
STATE BUT OF AN UNKNOWN

03:44:02.395 --> 03:44:05.231
MAGNITUDE -- THE SAVINGS -- WE

03:44:05.298 --> 03:44:08.134
THINK OF LEND ITSELF LEND

THEMSELVES TO THE LEGISLATURE

03:44:09.335 --> 03:44:10.737
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THIS

03:44:10.804 --> 03:44:12.972
ACTION AND AND I'LL DISCUSS SOME

03:44:13.039 --> 03:44:14.040
OF THE MEANS FOR OVERSIGHT HERE

03:44:14.107 --> 03:44:16.776
AND IN JUST ONE MINUTE -- BUT A

03:44:16.843 --> 03:44:18.077
SIGNIFICANT OF THE PORTION OF

03:44:18.144 --> 03:44:19.846
THE SAVINGS WE THINK COULD COME

03:44:19.913 --> 03:44:21.748
FROM THAT THREE FORTY BE --

03:44:21.815 --> 03:44:23.216
ELIGIBLE ENTITIES SUCH AS

03:44:23.283 --> 03:44:25.218
HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AND SO

03:44:25.285 --> 03:44:26.920
FORTH THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

03:44:26.986 --> 03:44:28.388
THOSE FEDERAL DRUG DISCOUNTS.

03:44:28.454 --> 03:44:30.323
AND THAT SOME OF THE SAVINGS

03:44:30.390 --> 03:44:31.891
COULD ALSO COME FROM THE

03:44:31.958 --> 03:44:33.693
SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES AND OTHER

03:44:33.760 --> 03:44:36.396
SORT OF REDUCE COST UNDER THE

03:44:36.462 --> 03:44:38.898
CARVE OUT -- SUCH AS REDUCE

COSTS IN MANAGED CARE -- WE DO

03:44:41.968 --> 03:44:43.136
FIND THOUGH THAT THE CAR ABOUT

03:44:43.203 --> 03:44:44.604
WOULD ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT

03:44:44.671 --> 03:44:46.506
IMPACTS ON A MAJOR MEDICAL

03:44:46.573 --> 03:44:48.708
STAKEHOLDERS -- FROM FIRM A

03:44:48.775 --> 03:44:50.743
BENEFICIARY PERSPECTIVE WE

03:44:50.810 --> 03:44:52.345
BELIEVE THAT THE CARVE OUT WOULD

03:44:52.412 --> 03:44:54.881
SERVE TO STANDARDIZE THE BENEFIT --

03:44:54.948 --> 03:44:57.383
CURRENTLY -- IF -- MEMBERS WHICH

03:44:57.450 --> 03:44:58.718

03:44:58.785 --> 03:45:01.421
EXAMPLE -- THEY MIGHT HAVE A

03:45:01.487 --> 03:45:03.156
LIST OF DRUGS AT DIFFERENT LIST

03:45:03.223 --> 03:45:04.190

03:45:04.257 --> 03:45:05.758
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND AND WHILE

03:45:05.825 --> 03:45:06.626
I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME

03:45:06.693 --> 03:45:08.061
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR THEM

03:45:08.127 --> 03:45:09.095
THERE COULD BE SOME AND

03:45:09.162 --> 03:45:11.598
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THAT THEY

03:45:11.664 --> 03:45:11.798
WOULD.

03:45:11.865 --> 03:45:14.534
HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- THAT SAID --

03:45:14.601 --> 03:45:16.236
WE DO RAISE SOME QUESTIONS AND

03:45:16.302 --> 03:45:18.404
CONCERNS IN THE REPORT ABOUT.

03:45:18.471 --> 03:45:19.906
WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE ON THE

03:45:19.973 --> 03:45:21.374

03:45:21.441 --> 03:45:22.909
THAT THAT PLANTS HAVE SUCH AS

THEIR DISEASE MANAGEMENT

03:45:24.477 --> 03:45:26.512

HIGH NEED POPULATIONS AND SO

03:45:28.348 --> 03:45:29.749
FORTH THEY DO TRACK --

03:45:29.816 --> 03:45:32.185
MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND SO --

03:45:32.252 --> 03:45:34.053
WE WOULD WE DO WE DO REYES CELLS

CONCERNS AN ASTON MINISTRATION

03:45:35.855 --> 03:45:37.724
TO COME UP WITH A PLAN -- TO

03:45:37.790 --> 03:45:39.392
INSURE SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES

03:45:39.459 --> 03:45:41.861
CAN CONTINUE OR EVEN BE IMPROVED

03:45:41.928 --> 03:45:43.897
ALSO NON CONSUMER STAKEHOLDERS

03:45:43.963 --> 03:45:45.398

03:45:53.039 --> 03:45:54.674
FUNDING GOING FORWARD -- THOUGH

03:45:54.741 --> 03:45:56.075
A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS

03:45:56.142 --> 03:45:57.477
REDUCTION IN FUNDING WOULD

03:45:57.543 --> 03:45:58.678

03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:14.894
THE ADMINISTRATION ASSERTS THE

03:46:14.961 --> 03:46:17.697
NO STATUTORY CHANGES ARE NEEDED --

03:46:17.764 --> 03:46:20.366
TO AFFECT THIS CARVE OUT AND GET

ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT THEY DO

03:57:05.511 --> 03:57:07.112
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND I

03:57:07.179 --> 03:57:08.547
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT ARE WORKS

03:57:10.182 --> 03:57:11.116

CLINICS OR THEIR THEIR GOOD WORK.

03:57:14.353 --> 03:57:16.488
OF INSTEAD WHAT WE'D LIKE TO

03:57:16.555 --> 03:57:18.891
TALK ABOUT IS HOW EFFECTIVE

03:57:18.958 --> 03:57:21.226
CALIFORNIA WAS IT MAXIMIZING

03:57:21.293 --> 03:57:23.762
DRUG SAVINGS WHEN THE MEDI CAL

03:57:23.829 --> 03:57:25.030
PROGRAM.

03:57:25.097 --> 03:57:27.132
NEGOTIATED SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES

03:57:27.199 --> 03:57:28.767
WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST STATES

03:57:28.834 --> 03:57:30.336
IN THE NATION TO DO THAT.

03:57:30.402 --> 03:57:32.504
OVER THE YEARS WE SAVED BILLIONS

03:57:32.571 --> 03:57:34.106
AND BILLIONS NOT MILLIONS

03:57:34.173 --> 03:57:37.309
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

03:57:37.376 --> 03:57:39.345
BY HAVING A SUPPLEMENTAL DRUG

03:57:39.411 --> 03:57:41.046
REBATE THAT WAS NEGOTIATED ON

03:57:41.113 --> 03:57:44.083
TOP OF THE MANDATORY REBATE

03:57:44.149 --> 03:57:46.285
FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT THE

03:57:46.352 --> 03:57:48.087
MEDICAID PROGRAM GET THE BEST

03:57:48.153 --> 03:57:49.388
PRICE.

03:57:49.455 --> 03:57:51.890
AS WE TRANSITION TO PEOPLE INTO

03:57:51.957 --> 03:57:54.193
MANAGED CARE WE GAVE UP THOSE

03:57:54.259 --> 03:57:56.495
SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES ON THE

03:57:56.562 --> 03:57:57.763
SCIRI.

03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:59.932
THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS

03:57:59.999 --> 03:58:01.100
WOULD DO A BETTER JOB

03:58:01.166 --> 03:58:03.469
NEGOTIATING WE SPENT A LOT OF

03:58:03.535 --> 03:58:05.471
TIME LOOKING AT WHAT MANAGED

03:58:05.537 --> 03:58:07.006
CARE PLANS DO IN NEGOTIATING

03:58:07.072 --> 03:58:08.807
DRUG PRICES IN THE COMMERCIAL

03:58:08.874 --> 03:58:11.410
SPACE AS A RESULT OF SB.

03:58:11.477 --> 03:58:12.578
SEVENTEEN OTHER PIECES OF

03:58:12.645 --> 03:58:14.146
LEGISLATION.

03:58:14.213 --> 03:58:16.715
AND BY AND LARGE WERE NOT VERY

03:58:16.782 --> 03:58:19.184
IMPRESSED -- WE THINK THAT THE

03:58:19.251 --> 03:58:20.686
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHE HAD A

03:58:20.753 --> 03:58:22.655
MUCH BETTER TRACK RECORD IN PART

03:58:22.721 --> 03:58:24.390
DRIVEN BY THE NEEDS OF OUR STATE

03:58:24.456 --> 03:58:25.290
BUDGET.

03:58:25.357 --> 03:58:26.825
IN ORDER TO BE THE MOST

03:58:26.892 --> 03:58:28.794
EFFICIENT WE COULD BE IN TERMS

03:58:28.861 --> 03:58:30.763
OF NEGOTIATING SUPPLEMENTAL

03:58:30.829 --> 03:58:31.730
REBATES.

03:58:31.797 --> 03:58:33.599
I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT STATE

03:58:33.666 --> 03:58:35.701
AND FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT

03:58:35.768 --> 03:58:37.369
THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM GIVE PEOPLE

03:58:37.436 --> 03:58:39.138
ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY

03:58:39.204 --> 03:58:42.174
DRUGS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:58:42.241 --> 03:58:43.876
IS A PREFERRED DRUG LIST.

03:58:43.942 --> 03:58:44.943
LITERALLY.

03:58:45.010 --> 03:58:47.279
THE MEDIC CAL PROGRAM NEGOTIATED

03:58:47.346 --> 03:58:49.615
WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER

03:58:49.682 --> 03:58:51.483
TO GET ADDITIONAL REBATES IN

03:58:51.550 --> 03:58:56.522
ADDITION TO THE 23% MANDATORY

03:58:56.588 --> 03:58:57.756
REBATE AND THEY ALL.

03:58:57.823 --> 03:58:58.424
ABOUT DOUBLE THAT AMOUNT THAT'S

03:58:58.490 --> 03:59:00.959
A LOT OF SAVINGS THAT GOT HANDED

03:59:01.026 --> 03:59:02.895
OFF TO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN

03:59:02.961 --> 03:59:04.496
THEORY IT'S REFLECTED IN THEIR

03:59:04.563 --> 03:59:05.998
RATES.

03:59:06.065 --> 03:59:07.866
WE CAN'T TELL WHAT'S ON THE MEDI

03:59:07.933 --> 03:59:09.735
CAL SIDE BUT ON THE COMMERCIAL

03:59:09.802 --> 03:59:12.037
SIDE WE KNOW NOW.

03:59:12.104 --> 03:59:13.539
THEY MOST THEM.

03:59:13.605 --> 03:59:15.674
DON'T BARGAIN HARD AT LEAST AS

03:59:15.741 --> 03:59:17.276
BEST WE CAN TELL.

03:59:17.342 --> 03:59:18.911
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS

03:59:18.977 --> 03:59:20.012
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND HAVE

03:59:20.079 --> 03:59:21.447
BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THEM

03:59:21.513 --> 03:59:23.115
ON HOW THEY CAN BE EVEN MORE

03:59:23.182 --> 03:59:24.616
EFFECTIVE THAN THEY WERE IN THE

03:59:24.683 --> 03:59:27.453
PAST WE SUGGEST FOR EXAMPLE.

03:59:27.519 --> 03:59:28.087
THAT THEY THINK ABOUT A

03:59:28.153 --> 03:59:30.456
FORMULARY THAT'S BY CONDITIONS

03:59:30.522 --> 03:59:33.425
SO IF YOU HAVE ASTHMA THAT THEY

03:59:33.492 --> 03:59:35.060
NEGOTIATE A COUPLE OF THE

03:59:35.127 --> 03:59:36.762
INAPPROPRIATE FORMULAR A FOR THE

03:59:36.829 --> 03:59:38.697
ASTHMA DRUGS IF YOU HAVE HIGH

03:59:38.764 --> 03:59:39.331
BLOOD PRESSURE.

03:59:39.398 --> 03:59:41.233
THEY HAVEN'T ACOSTA ENOUGH

03:59:41.300 --> 03:59:42.735
GENERICS IN EACH CATEGORY TO

03:59:42.801 --> 03:59:44.303
TREAT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE BUT

03:59:44.369 --> 03:59:45.838
NOT EVERY DRUG.

03:59:45.904 --> 03:59:47.506
AND THAT THEY NEGOTIATE BUT

03:59:47.573 --> 03:59:49.575
CONDITION WE'VE ALSO SUGGESTED

03:59:49.641 --> 03:59:51.243
THAT SOMETHING THAT THE HEALTH

03:59:51.310 --> 03:59:52.945
PLANS THEMSELVES ARE REQUIRED BY

03:59:53.011 --> 03:59:54.913
FEDERAL LAW TO HAVE A EIGHT

03:59:54.980 --> 03:59:56.181
WHAT'S CALLED A PAEAN TO

03:59:56.248 --> 03:59:57.649
COMMITTEE OF PHARMACEUTICAL IN

03:59:57.716 --> 03:59:58.917
THERAPEUTICS COMMITTEE WOULD BE

03:59:58.984 --> 04:00:00.419
GOOD FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE

04:00:00.486 --> 04:00:02.121
SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HELP THEM

04:00:02.187 --> 04:00:02.321
WITH.

04:00:02.387 --> 04:00:03.622
THESE CLINICAL DISCUSSIONS.

04:00:03.689 --> 04:00:05.357
AND CERTAINLY PRESCRIBING

04:00:05.424 --> 04:00:07.126
INFORMATION IS SOME OF THE MOST

04:00:07.192 --> 04:00:08.927
REAL TIME INFORMATION THAT WE

04:00:08.994 --> 04:00:10.829
HAVEN'T HEALTH CARE IT SHOULD BE

04:00:10.896 --> 04:00:13.699
AVAILABLE IN REAL TIME IT'S ALL

04:00:13.766 --> 04:00:15.167
IT'S ALMOST ALL OUR TRONIC AND

04:00:15.234 --> 04:00:17.035
HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME SO.

04:00:17.102 --> 04:00:19.471
THAT MAKES SENSE TO US AS WELL.

04:00:19.538 --> 04:00:21.340
WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:00:21.406 --> 04:00:23.709
IS PEOPLE ARE GIVEN ACCESS TO

04:00:23.776 --> 04:00:25.043
MEDICALLY NECESSARY DRUGS THAT

04:00:25.110 --> 04:00:26.712
THERE'S A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES

04:00:26.779 --> 04:00:28.514
CLINICIANS IN MAKING THAT

04:00:28.580 --> 04:00:30.415
DECISION. FOR MANAGED CARE WE

04:00:30.482 --> 04:00:31.784
HAVE THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL

04:00:31.850 --> 04:00:33.085
REVIEW PROCESS IT'S A LITTLE

04:00:33.152 --> 04:00:34.920
DIFFERENT FOR MEDI CAL WE WOULD

04:00:34.987 --> 04:00:36.688
HOPE THAT IS THIS IS DEVELOPED

04:00:36.755 --> 04:00:38.157
THERE WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING

04:00:38.223 --> 04:00:39.892
THAT INVOLVES CLINICIANS WITH

04:00:39.958 --> 04:00:42.194
THE RELEVANT EXPERTISE.

04:00:42.261 --> 04:00:43.662
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS SALES MUST

04:00:43.729 --> 04:00:44.997
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS LUPUS

04:00:45.063 --> 04:00:46.765
WHATEVER THE CONDITION IS THAT

04:00:46.832 --> 04:00:51.537
WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE THAT'S

04:00:51.603 --> 04:00:53.705
NECESSARY.

04:00:53.772 --> 04:00:55.240
SO YOUR ANALYSIS OF NOTES A

04:00:55.307 --> 04:00:56.875
NUMBER OF OTHERS WERE WE MADE

04:00:56.942 --> 04:00:59.178
SUGGESTIONS -- BUT THE HOURS

04:00:59.244 --> 04:01:00.579
LATE AND WE WILL.

04:01:00.646 --> 04:01:01.914
LEAVE HE WE WERE SURE YOU'VE

04:01:01.980 --> 04:01:04.883
DONE YOUR READING SO WE WERE

04:01:04.950 --> 04:01:07.719
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

04:01:07.786 --> 04:01:09.655
THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ALL OF THE

04:01:09.721 --> 04:01:12.224
COMMENTS -- WERE VERY IMPORTANT

04:01:12.291 --> 04:01:14.059
I THINK ALL OF THOSE ARE GOOD

04:01:14.126 --> 04:01:16.962
SUGGESTIONS [inaudible]

04:01:17.029 --> 04:01:20.165
QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible]

04:01:20.232 --> 04:01:21.700
DOCTOR WOULD.

04:01:21.767 --> 04:01:23.969
HI I'M JUST YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE

04:01:24.036 --> 04:01:25.671
HEARD I'VE HEARD FROM.

04:01:25.737 --> 04:01:27.406
MANY MANY CLINICS IN MY DISTRICT

04:01:27.472 --> 04:01:29.641
ABOUT SIX THEIR CONCERN HERE --

04:01:29.708 --> 04:01:31.410
AND SO.

04:01:31.476 --> 04:01:32.411
ARE THERE MEETINGS HAPPENING

04:01:32.477 --> 04:01:34.213
WITH.

04:01:34.279 --> 04:01:36.748
I DIED AT TO TRY TO RESOLVE.

04:01:36.815 --> 04:01:38.450
RESOLVE THE CONCERNS.

04:01:38.517 --> 04:01:40.219
YES SO WE HAVE MET WITH THE

04:01:40.285 --> 04:01:43.021
CLINICS THE HOSPITALS THE PLANS --

04:01:43.088 --> 04:01:45.023
I THINK IN SOME CASES IT'S BEEN

04:01:45.090 --> 04:01:46.391
ASKING QUESTIONS YOU KNOW FOR

04:01:46.458 --> 04:01:47.659
CLARITY AROUND WHAT THE

04:01:47.726 --> 04:01:49.862
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IS

04:01:49.928 --> 04:01:52.130
AND HOW WE'RE PROCEEDING -- I

04:01:52.197 --> 04:01:53.832
THINK WE HAVE CHALLENGED THE

04:01:53.899 --> 04:01:55.067
PLANS IN THE HOSPITALS AND THE

04:01:55.133 --> 04:01:57.970
CLINICS -- TO YOU KNOW IF

04:01:58.036 --> 04:01:59.304
THERE'S A PROPOSAL OR A COUNTER

04:01:59.371 --> 04:02:01.673
PROPOSAL -- THAT MEETS THE

04:02:01.740 --> 04:02:03.141
GOVERNOR'S OBJECTIVES AROUND

04:02:03.208 --> 04:02:05.477
PRICE SCENE AND GREATER

04:02:05.544 --> 04:02:07.312
TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE THREE

04:02:07.379 --> 04:02:09.848
FORTY B. -- REVENUES THAT WE

04:02:09.915 --> 04:02:11.550
WOULD BE OPEN TO SEEN THAT AND

04:02:11.617 --> 04:02:12.818
SO I THINK IN SOME CASES THERE'S

04:02:12.885 --> 04:02:14.353
AN ONGOING DIALOGUE AS IT

04:02:14.419 --> 04:02:16.421
PERTAINS TO THE DATA ISSUE WITH

04:02:16.488 --> 04:02:18.657
THE HEALTH PLANS -- WE'VE HAD

04:02:18.724 --> 04:02:20.292
BOTH GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

04:02:20.359 --> 04:02:22.227
PLANS AS WELL AS WE HAVE BEEN IN

04:02:22.294 --> 04:02:24.062
CONTACT WITH A COUPLE.

04:02:24.129 --> 04:02:26.398
OF OUR MANAGED CARE PARTNERS

04:02:26.465 --> 04:02:28.367
THAT WE RELY PRETTY HEAVILY ON

04:02:28.433 --> 04:02:30.569
FOR TECHNICAL FEEDBACK SOMETIMES

04:02:30.636 --> 04:02:31.904
I THINK THAT WE HAVE HEARD LOUD

04:02:31.970 --> 04:02:33.472
AND CLEAR THAT DATA.

04:02:33.538 --> 04:02:35.674
AND REAL TIME DATA IS IS THE

04:02:35.741 --> 04:02:37.442
IDEAL AND WE AGREE AND SO I

04:02:37.509 --> 04:02:38.911
THINK WE INTERNALLY YOU'RE

04:02:38.977 --> 04:02:40.379
LOOKING AT OUR SYSTEMS THAT ARE

04:02:40.445 --> 04:02:41.880
CAPACITY IN CAPE CAPABILITY TO

04:02:41.947 --> 04:02:43.148
DO THAT SO.

04:02:43.215 --> 04:02:44.483
I THINK YOU KNOW WE ARE OPEN TO

04:02:44.549 --> 04:02:46.451
A DISCUSSION AS LONG AS IT IS

04:02:46.518 --> 04:02:48.186
HITTING SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES

04:02:48.253 --> 04:02:49.855
THAT WE NEED IN TERMS OF THE

04:02:49.922 --> 04:02:51.089
STATE'S PROPOSAL AROUND.

GREATER SAVINGS GREATER LEVERAGE --

04:02:54.393 --> 04:02:55.928
TO ACHIEVE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES

04:02:55.994 --> 04:02:57.629
TO THE EXTENT THAT DRUGS REMAIN

04:02:57.696 --> 04:02:58.864
IN THE MANAGED CARE PROGRAM WE

04:02:58.931 --> 04:03:00.132
LOSE ALL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL

04:03:00.198 --> 04:03:01.667
REBATE DISCUSSION SO THERE IS.

04:03:01.733 --> 04:03:04.670
AN ATTENUATED -- NEED TO KIND OF

UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE

04:03:06.171 --> 04:03:10.542
THINKING FOR CONSIDERATION THERE.

04:03:10.609 --> 04:03:11.176
WELL I GUESS MY CONCERN IS AND

04:03:11.243 --> 04:03:13.145
THE I'VE HEARD THIS SENSE ALMOST.

04:03:13.211 --> 04:03:15.280
INSTANTLY SINCE THE INTRODUCTION

04:03:15.347 --> 04:03:17.449
OF THE THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN AND

04:03:17.516 --> 04:03:19.084
AND I AM CONCERNED IS IS.

04:03:19.151 --> 04:03:19.851
YOU KNOW.

04:03:19.918 --> 04:03:21.520
I'M NOT AND I'M NOT IN THE BEST

04:03:21.586 --> 04:03:23.055
POSITION TO JUDGE ARE THERE IS

04:03:23.121 --> 04:03:24.489
THE POTENTIAL.

04:03:24.556 --> 04:03:26.058
FOR CLINICS TO CLOSE BECAUSE OF

04:03:26.124 --> 04:03:27.559
THIS CHANGE IN POLICY.

04:03:27.626 --> 04:03:30.562
THAT WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE --

04:03:30.629 --> 04:03:33.532
AND SO I'M I'M I LOOK FORWARD TO

04:03:33.598 --> 04:03:34.900
HEARING THE RESOLUTION OF THESE

04:03:34.967 --> 04:03:37.135
DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE AT A TIME

04:03:37.202 --> 04:03:40.205
WHEN YOU KNOW WE WE DESPERATELY

04:03:40.272 --> 04:03:41.807
NEED -- CLINICS AND TO BE ABLE

04:03:41.873 --> 04:03:43.375
TO PROVIDE CARE AT THE THOUGHT

04:03:43.442 --> 04:03:44.376
THAT WE MIGHT LOSE SOME OF THEM

04:03:44.443 --> 04:03:46.912
BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN POLICY.

04:03:46.979 --> 04:03:48.780
I'D I'D I NEED TO UNDERSTAND

04:03:48.847 --> 04:03:51.550
THAT BETTER SO I WILL I WILL

04:03:51.616 --> 04:03:52.317
LOOK FORWARD -- TO RESPONSE AT

04:03:52.384 --> 04:03:53.485
SOME POINT AND I WOULD SAY THAT

04:03:53.552 --> 04:03:56.121
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY --

04:03:56.188 --> 04:03:57.622
OF SUPPORTING AND BUILDING THE

04:03:57.689 --> 04:03:59.191
SAFETY NET GREAT YOU KNOW WE WE

04:03:59.257 --> 04:04:00.926
NEGOTIATE ENTIRE MEDICAID

04:04:00.993 --> 04:04:03.362
WAIVERS TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL

04:04:03.428 --> 04:04:04.796
YOU KNOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO

04:04:04.863 --> 04:04:07.199
SUPPORT -- OUR SAFETY NET AND SO

04:04:07.265 --> 04:04:09.134
IT'S NOT OUR INTEREST NOR OUR

04:04:09.201 --> 04:04:11.803
INTENTION TO HARM THAT WE FULLY

04:04:11.870 --> 04:04:13.939
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CLINICS

04:04:14.006 --> 04:04:15.540
PROVIDE THE BACKBONE OF OUR

04:04:15.607 --> 04:04:16.608
PRIMARY CARE SYSTEM IN THE

04:04:16.675 --> 04:04:18.210
MEDICAID PROGRAM.

04:04:18.276 --> 04:04:20.379
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS --

04:04:20.445 --> 04:04:22.948
SAID IS THAT IN THIS KIND OF AND

04:04:23.015 --> 04:04:24.082
IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A

04:04:24.149 --> 04:04:25.817
PAINFUL DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF

04:04:25.884 --> 04:04:28.286
THE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

04:04:28.353 --> 04:04:29.388
THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM.

04:04:29.454 --> 04:04:33.091
IS COME TO US AND SHOW US WHAT --

04:04:33.158 --> 04:04:34.192
THE CLINICS BOTH.

04:04:34.259 --> 04:04:35.927
I RECEIVE THE REVENUE FOR AND

04:04:35.994 --> 04:04:37.295
WHAT YOU USE IT FOR AND TO THE

04:04:37.362 --> 04:04:38.230
EXTENT THAT THE STATE

04:04:38.296 --> 04:04:39.898
COLLECTIVELY SEES.

04:04:39.965 --> 04:04:41.867
THAT IN A IN A MORE TRANSPARENT

04:04:41.933 --> 04:04:43.869
WAY IT'S A POLICY DISCUSSION

04:04:43.935 --> 04:04:44.803
ABOUT HOW THE STATE WANTS TO

04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:46.905
PRIORITIZE THOSE FUNDS AND AND

04:04:46.972 --> 04:04:48.006
THE TYPES OF SAFETY NET

04:04:48.073 --> 04:04:49.641
INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE

04:04:49.708 --> 04:04:51.309
WANT TO COLLECTIVELY SUPPORT AND

04:04:51.376 --> 04:04:51.810
SO.

04:04:51.877 --> 04:04:53.979
I THINK THAT'S THE DISCUSSION

04:04:54.046 --> 04:04:54.946
THAT WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE AND

04:04:55.013 --> 04:04:57.749
SO WOULD CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO

04:04:57.816 --> 04:04:58.316
TO WORK WITH YOU AS WELL AS

04:04:58.383 --> 04:05:02.687
OTHERS ON THAT.

04:05:02.754 --> 04:05:04.423
AND I TEND TO TALK ABOUT CLINICS --

04:05:04.489 --> 04:05:06.091
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS -- THAT

04:05:06.158 --> 04:05:07.859
WE ARE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A

04:05:07.926 --> 04:05:09.828
TRANSPARENCY PROPOSAL SINCE LAST

04:05:09.895 --> 04:05:11.897
YEAR -- TO AND KNOWING THAT

04:05:11.963 --> 04:05:13.165
THAT'S BEEN A TOUGH.

04:05:13.231 --> 04:05:14.666
PLACE TO TALK ABOUT AND WORKING

04:05:14.733 --> 04:05:15.834
ON IT SINCE EVERYBODY DOES A

04:05:15.901 --> 04:05:16.968
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THE NOTES

04:05:17.035 --> 04:05:18.403
I HAVE HERE SHOW TO HEALTH

04:05:18.470 --> 04:05:18.970
CENTERS DOING A LITTLE BIT

04:05:19.037 --> 04:05:21.339
DIFFERENTLY -- BUT WE WANT TO BE

04:05:21.406 --> 04:05:22.808
TRANSPARENT AND THE SAVINGS

04:05:22.874 --> 04:05:24.643
MEANS SO MUCH TO US AND ARE ABLE

04:05:24.709 --> 04:05:25.544
TO SUPPORT.

04:05:25.610 --> 04:05:26.745
THINGS LIKE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS

04:05:26.812 --> 04:05:27.846
OF HEALTH THINGS LIKE CARE

04:05:27.913 --> 04:05:29.648
COORDINATION ALL THE THINGS -- I

04:05:29.714 --> 04:05:30.549
THINK THE PROBABLY THE MOST

04:05:30.615 --> 04:05:32.050
EXCITING THINGS ABOUT HEALTHCARE

04:05:32.117 --> 04:05:33.418
ARE IN THE THREE FORTY B.

04:05:33.485 --> 04:05:34.686
PROGRAM AND SO WE DON'T WANT

04:05:34.753 --> 04:05:36.254
THEM TO GO AWAY AT ALL AND IF WE

04:05:36.321 --> 04:05:37.556
CAN BE MORE TRANSPARENT AND

04:05:37.622 --> 04:05:39.057
DELIBERATE AND CLEAR BACK TO THE

04:05:39.124 --> 04:05:41.393
STATE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING.

04:05:41.460 --> 04:05:41.993
WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO DO

04:05:42.060 --> 04:05:43.295
THAT.

04:05:43.361 --> 04:05:46.131
THANK YOU I I WANT TO SAY THAT I

04:05:46.198 --> 04:05:47.432
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE

04:05:47.499 --> 04:05:49.968
GOVERNOR CAME IN AND HE KNEW

04:05:50.035 --> 04:05:51.236
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

04:05:51.303 --> 04:05:53.105
DRUG PRICES ARE TOO HIGH AND WE

04:05:53.171 --> 04:05:54.372
KEEP HEARING.

04:05:54.439 --> 04:05:55.807
ESPECIALLY WITH FAMILIES AND

04:05:55.874 --> 04:05:57.109
WITH OUR SENIORS THAT THEY HAVE

04:05:57.175 --> 04:05:59.077
TO DECIDE OR DO I FEEL THE

04:05:59.144 --> 04:06:00.745
PRESCRIPTION OR DO I PUT FOOD ON

04:06:00.812 --> 04:06:02.180
THE TABLE.

04:06:02.247 --> 04:06:04.116
A SITE I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

04:06:04.182 --> 04:06:06.351
HE SAW HOW SERIOUS IT WAS AND

04:06:06.418 --> 04:06:07.352
THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE

04:06:07.419 --> 04:06:09.020
ABOUT IT.

04:06:09.087 --> 04:06:11.690
I TOO HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM MY

04:06:11.756 --> 04:06:14.493
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS -- THEY

04:06:14.559 --> 04:06:16.394
ARE SOUL IMPORTANT IN OUR

04:06:16.461 --> 04:06:18.063
COMMUNITY.

04:06:18.130 --> 04:06:23.301
AND WE WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT

04:06:23.368 --> 04:06:24.369
THAT DOESN'T BECOME THE

04:06:24.436 --> 04:06:26.605
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE.

04:06:26.671 --> 04:06:28.406
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE

04:06:28.473 --> 04:06:30.542
DEVASTATING TO THE COMMUNITIES --

04:06:30.609 --> 04:06:31.943
THE TRANSPARENCY IS EXTREMELY

04:06:32.010 --> 04:06:34.179
IMPORTANT SO IF IF THE

04:06:34.246 --> 04:06:36.314
ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING WE WANT

04:06:36.381 --> 04:06:37.549
TO EVALUATE.

04:06:37.616 --> 04:06:38.850
BUT DON'T GIVE A SANTA DON'T

04:06:38.917 --> 04:06:40.585
ONLY INFORMATION GIVE US HARD

04:06:40.652 --> 04:06:43.955
FACTS -- THEN THE VALUATION CAN

04:06:44.022 --> 04:06:47.025
BE PROPERLY MADE -- AS OPPOSED

04:06:47.092 --> 04:06:48.660
TO YES WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE DOWN.

04:06:48.727 --> 04:06:50.428
SHOW ME THE NUMBERS SHOW ME

04:06:50.495 --> 04:06:52.430
EXACTLY WHY YOU WOULD BE CLOSING

04:06:52.497 --> 04:06:54.966
DOWN -- IF IF WE WERE TO

04:06:55.033 --> 04:06:57.869
IMPLEMENT THIS -- HOW IMPORTANT

04:06:57.936 --> 04:06:59.604
IS A THREE FORTY PROGRAM HOW

04:06:59.671 --> 04:07:01.506
MUCH MONEY IS COMING IN?

04:07:01.573 --> 04:07:02.974
AND I THINK THAT.

04:07:03.041 --> 04:07:04.276
AS OPPOSED TO DOING IT

04:07:04.342 --> 04:07:06.645
ANECDOTALLY IF WE HAVE TOTAL

04:07:06.711 --> 04:07:08.680
TRANSPARENCY THE INFORMATION IS

04:07:08.747 --> 04:07:09.814
PROVIDED.

04:07:09.881 --> 04:07:10.782
THEN THE SOMETHING THE

04:07:10.849 --> 04:07:12.584
ADMINISTRATION COULD SAY -- THAT

04:07:12.651 --> 04:07:14.553
MAKES SENSE NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY

04:07:14.619 --> 04:07:17.622
YOU SAY YOU MAY CLOSE DOWN BUT

04:07:17.689 --> 04:07:19.157
IF THE CLINICS ARE SAYING.

04:07:19.224 --> 04:07:20.058
WE MAY HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN

04:07:20.125 --> 04:07:21.726
BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

04:07:21.793 --> 04:07:23.495
PART THE REBATE TO SUCH AN

04:07:23.562 --> 04:07:26.398
IMPORTANT PART -- I CAN SEE THE

04:07:26.464 --> 04:07:27.866
PUSH BACK I CAN UNDERSTAND THE

04:07:27.933 --> 04:07:29.701
PUSH BACK SO I WOULD HOPE LIKE

04:07:29.768 --> 04:07:30.869
DOCTOR WOULD DO THAT.

04:07:30.936 --> 04:07:33.939
THE CONVERSATIONS WOULD CONTINUE.

04:07:34.005 --> 04:07:35.340
BECAUSE WHAT THE GOVERNOR DID

04:07:35.407 --> 04:07:38.810
WAS VERY BOLD AND THE WE HAVE TO

04:07:38.877 --> 04:07:41.246
WE HAVE TO GET FULL CREDIT. FOR

04:07:41.313 --> 04:07:44.282
FOR HIS COURAGE TO TO DO THAT.

04:07:44.349 --> 04:07:46.284
WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE.

04:07:46.351 --> 04:07:47.652
AND HE WOULD BE JUST AS

04:07:47.719 --> 04:07:48.320
CONCERNED ABOUT COMMUNITY HEALTH

04:07:48.386 --> 04:07:49.554
CENTERS.

04:07:49.621 --> 04:07:51.122
WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT ARE A

04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:52.691
COMMUNITY CENTERS COMMUNITY

04:07:52.757 --> 04:07:55.927
HEALTH CENTERS DO NOT CLOSE DOWN.

04:07:55.994 --> 04:07:57.662
SO THE INFORMATION I THINK HAS

04:07:57.729 --> 04:08:01.466
TO BE PROVIDED FOR FOR FOR FOR

04:08:01.533 --> 04:08:05.403
FOR FULLY VALUATION [inaudible]

04:08:05.470 --> 04:08:08.073
ANYTHING FURTHER.

04:08:08.139 --> 04:08:09.774
NO I I AGREE I THINK -- WE ALL

04:08:09.841 --> 04:08:10.909
SHARE THE VISION OF THE GOVERNOR

04:08:10.976 --> 04:08:12.277
THE GOVERNOR'S VISION OF FINDING

04:08:12.344 --> 04:08:14.145
A WAY TO REDUCE DRUG PRICES I

04:08:14.212 --> 04:08:14.679
MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING OF

04:08:14.746 --> 04:08:15.780
TEMPERATE AND THAT'S THE DAY I

04:08:15.847 --> 04:08:18.049
GOT HERE AND YES -- AND WILL

04:08:18.116 --> 04:08:20.318
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE

04:08:20.385 --> 04:08:22.387
IT YOU KNOW AT AS DRUG PRICES

04:08:22.454 --> 04:08:23.788
CONTINUE TO RISE.

04:08:23.855 --> 04:08:25.757
AT THE HIGH AT FASTER THAN ANY

04:08:25.824 --> 04:08:27.392
OTHER SECTOR OF HEALTH CARE --

04:08:27.459 --> 04:08:28.994
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET OUR

04:08:29.060 --> 04:08:30.528
ARMS AROUND THIS AND SO I I

04:08:30.595 --> 04:08:31.663
APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS

04:08:31.730 --> 04:08:32.530
IN AND THEY JUST.

04:08:32.597 --> 04:08:34.899
MY CONCERN IS IS IS NOT WANTING

04:08:34.966 --> 04:08:36.001
TO HAVE AN UNINTENDED

04:08:36.067 --> 04:08:37.602
CONSEQUENCE AND AND LOSE

04:08:37.669 --> 04:08:38.903
PROVIDERS BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF

04:08:38.970 --> 04:08:41.473
THAT.

04:08:41.539 --> 04:08:42.107
SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL

04:08:42.173 --> 04:08:44.109
BE.

04:08:44.175 --> 04:08:44.909
EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T

04:08:44.976 --> 04:08:47.112
HAPPEN WILL YOU WILL YOU GIVE ME

04:08:47.178 --> 04:08:48.313
ONE ANECDOTE WILL YOU ALLOW ME

04:08:48.380 --> 04:08:50.482
ONE ENACTED.

04:08:50.548 --> 04:08:52.017
YES OKAY.

04:08:52.083 --> 04:08:54.953
SO -- WE HAVE I ASK QUESTIONS OF

04:08:55.020 --> 04:08:55.587
MY DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I REALLY

04:08:55.654 --> 04:08:57.522
LIKE DATA AND I ASKED A QUESTION

04:08:57.589 --> 04:08:59.391
OF MY DATA ANALYTICS PEOPLE A

04:08:59.457 --> 04:09:00.892
FEW YEARS AGO AND SAID WHAT.

04:09:00.959 --> 04:09:02.160
WHAT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE

04:09:02.227 --> 04:09:04.062
PERSON IN MY PROGRAM RIGHT I

04:09:04.129 --> 04:09:06.498
KNOW HOW MUCH ONE PERSON THERE'S

04:09:06.564 --> 04:09:08.133
GOT TO BE ONE PERSON THAT HAS?

04:09:08.199 --> 04:09:09.668
HAS RECEIVED A LOT.

04:09:09.734 --> 04:09:11.736
AND WE HAVE ONE PERSON THAT HAS

04:09:11.803 --> 04:09:14.773
RECEIVED IN THE IN THAT YEAR --

04:09:14.839 --> 04:09:15.774
TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THEY

04:09:15.840 --> 04:09:17.309
WERE THEY COST US TWENTY ONE

04:09:17.375 --> 04:09:18.510
MILLION DOLLARS I HAVE FIVE

04:09:18.576 --> 04:09:20.879
PEOPLE THAT OF COST OVERTEN

04:09:20.945 --> 04:09:21.246
MILLION DOLLARS.

04:09:21.313 --> 04:09:22.580
AND YOU CAN HAVE THESE

04:09:22.647 --> 04:09:24.082
THEORETICAL CONVERSATIONS AROUND

04:09:24.149 --> 04:09:25.583
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS HEALTH CARE

04:09:25.650 --> 04:09:27.852
COST IN IS IT TOO MUCH AND ARE

04:09:27.919 --> 04:09:29.287
YOU DOING A BETTER JOB YOU KNOW

04:09:29.354 --> 04:09:30.288
WHY DON'T PEOPLE TAKE MORE

04:09:30.355 --> 04:09:31.823
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR COSTS

04:09:31.890 --> 04:09:32.757
YOU KNOW WHATEVER.

04:09:32.824 --> 04:09:34.759
AND WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THAT I

TRADITIONS.

04:10:00.352 --> 04:10:01.820
THAT ARE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

04:10:01.886 --> 04:10:04.255
A YEAR -- WHICH WITHIN HOURS WE

04:10:04.322 --> 04:10:06.024
HAVE REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION I

04:10:06.091 --> 04:10:08.593
MEAN WE DO SOME REALLY AMAZING

04:10:08.660 --> 04:10:10.161
AND INCREDIBLE THINGS I THINK WE

04:10:10.228 --> 04:10:12.330
RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT -- THE

04:10:12.397 --> 04:10:14.699
AVAILABILITY AND ACCESS TO

04:10:14.766 --> 04:10:16.634
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS.

04:10:16.701 --> 04:10:17.569
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THAT CAN

04:10:17.635 --> 04:10:19.137
SUPPORT A TWENTY ONE MILLION

04:10:19.204 --> 04:10:20.138
DOLLAR INDIVIDUAL OTHER THAN THE

04:10:20.205 --> 04:10:21.373
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

04:10:21.439 --> 04:10:23.174
PROGRAM THAT WE RUN -- THAT IS

04:10:23.241 --> 04:10:25.143
NOT POSSIBLE AND AS AN EMPLOYER

04:10:25.210 --> 04:10:27.045
BASED COVERAGE ON IT WOULD

04:10:27.112 --> 04:10:27.779
CRIPPLE SOMEONE WITH AN

04:10:27.846 --> 04:10:29.414
INDIVIDUAL POLICY AND SO I THINK

04:10:29.481 --> 04:10:32.183
WE'RE EXTREMELY MINDFUL OF THE

04:10:32.250 --> 04:10:33.451
IMPORTANCE OF THE BENEFIT.

04:10:33.518 --> 04:10:34.919
BUT ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE

04:10:34.986 --> 04:10:37.122
THAT WE ARE USING ALL OF THE

04:10:37.188 --> 04:10:38.923
POWER OF OUR DEPARTMENT AND THE

04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:40.425
FACT THAT WE'RE THE FIFTH

04:10:40.492 --> 04:10:42.026
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE STATE.

04:10:42.093 --> 04:10:44.329

TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE NEGOTIATE

04:10:46.531 --> 04:10:48.333

04:10:48.400 --> 04:10:49.100
YOU HEAR A COMMITMENT FROM US

04:10:49.167 --> 04:10:49.768

04:10:51.403 --> 04:10:52.737
IMPORTANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT

WE ALSO ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE

04:10:55.206 --> 04:10:55.707

UNWILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS THIS

04:16:19.063 --> 04:16:20.832
