PROTECTIONS WHEN BUILDINGS ARE

DEEMED UNSAFE. CURRENT LAW

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.855
PROVIDES THAT IF ANY DWELLING

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:54.958

ZONED EVEN IF THEY ARE BEING

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:12.075
INHABITED. AS WE KNOW SADLY

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.243
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DIRE

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:16.546
CONSEQUENCES WITH PEOPLE LIVING

SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS AND

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:30.526
ASSOCIATED DANGERS DO NOT CEASE

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.261
TO EXIST JUST BECAUSE OF ZONING

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:33.896
FOR THE PAST DECADE CALIFORNIA

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.765
HAS AND CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.600
A HOUSING SHORTAGE OF

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:38.901
SIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.570
PARTICULARLY IN THE FOR DOUBLE

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.772
HOUSING SECTOR AND THE HOMELESS

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:45.041
POPULATION HAS ALMOST DOUBLED

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:47.677
SINCE THE PANDEMIC. INDIVIDUALS

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.078
AND FAMILIES WHO ARE UNABLE TO

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:51.147
FIND AVAILABLE BEDS IN HOMELESS

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:52.648
SHELTERS ARE SEEKING SHELTER

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.951
FROM THE STREETS AND TAKING UP

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:56.419
RESIDENCE AND BUILDINGS THAT

HAVE NOT BEEN ZONED RESIDENTIAL

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.392
. THIS HAS ENHANCED A PROBLEM

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.093
WHERE BOTH WAREHOUSES AND

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.695
FACTORY SPACES ARE BEING

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.030
CONVERTED TO RESIDENTIAL USE

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:09.766
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF LOCAL

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:10.299
OFFICIALS AND WITHOUT THE

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:14.003
BUILDING BEING HABITABLE DESPITE

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.640
MANY PAIN THE OWNER RENT MANY

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:18.841
WHO ARE PAYING THE OWNER TO RENT

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.109
THE SPACE. MANY OF THESE

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.277
WAREHOUSES FACTORIES AND

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.845
BUILDINGS ARE NOT IN RESIDENTIAL

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:25.148
ZONES AND THEREFORE HAVE EVADED

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:27.950
MUCH NEEDED INSPECTION. IN

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:30.653
DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN AS I

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.954
MENTIONED DEADLY

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.823
FIRE IN OAKLAND WHERE HOUSE

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.259
KNOWN AS THE GO SHIP THAT KILLED

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:38.928
THIRTY SIX PEOPLE. THE HIGHEST

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.763
DEATH TOLL FOR STRUCTURAL FIRE

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.398
IN THE UNITED STATES IN OVER A

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:44.901
DECADE. GO SHIP WAS A TWO STORY

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:46.569
WAREHOUSETHAT WAS ILLEGALLY

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.337
BEING LEASED TO ARTISTS WHO LIVE

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.606
AND WORK IN THE BUILDING AND

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:53.076
PERIODICALLY USING IT FOR EVEN.

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:55.044
ZONED AS A WAREHOUSE NEITHER

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:57.180
RESIDENTIAL NOR ASSEMBLY USES

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.082
WERE PERMITTED BY THE CITY AND

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.050
THE BUILDING WAS NOT DESIGNED OR

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.019
BUILT FOR HUMAN HABITATION.

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.821
UNFORTUNATELY THIS TRAGEDY IS

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:07.256
NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:09.525

MANY CALIFORNIANS FOR TOO LONG.

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:16.566
WHAT I'LL JUST ADD TO THIS IS

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:18.768
THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE AS WE

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:21.504
KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.574
PEOPLE SEEKING HOUSING THERE ARE

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.743
MANY. INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY OWN

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.012

TELL YOU FROM FIRST PERSONAL

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:05.161
EXPERIENCE. I WAS IN A PROPERTY

BED BUG. BITES THIS COULD NOT

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.736
CONTINUE TO OCCUR IN CALIFORNIA.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.604
FORTUNATELY WE HAVE GOOD HOUSING

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:17.773
LAWS THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.475
ARE LOOPHOLES IN THESE LAWS. AND

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:20.876
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:22.478
SLUMLORDS OR DRIVING TRUCKS

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.814
THROUGH THESE LOOPHOLES TO AVOID

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.151
RESPONSIBILITY. TO REFUSE OR OR

COST FOR COMPLIANCE. AS A RESULT

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:35.624
OF THAT WE ARE SEEING TRAGEDIES

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.360
OCCUR IN PROPERTIES LIKE THE

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:38.994
GHOST SHIP FIRE. I KNOW GO SHIP

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:40.863

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:45.901
ISOLATED INCIDENT. THIS OCCURS

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:48.504
AND I SEE IT ALL THE TIME IN

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:50.106

MEMBERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:54.844
WE CANNOT ALLOW SUB STANDARD

HOUSING- TO BE EXCUSE FOR A

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.049
HOUSING CRISIS. THIS BILL DOES

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:01.417
THREE THINGS THESE THREE THINGS

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:02.985
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE OUR

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:05.020
LAWS MORE EFFECTIVE. EFFICIENT

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:06.889
AND FAIR FROM THOSE SUFFERING

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:08.824
AND SUBGENERA HOUSING. ONE IS A

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:10.659
CLOSES A LOOPHOLE THAT MAKES

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:13.229
CLEAR NOW WITH THIS BILL. THAT

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:15.664
THIS LAW APPLIES TO ANY PROPERTY

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:17.566
OCCUPIED REGARDLESS OF ZONING.

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:19.802
MOLD BED BUGS FIRE HAZARDS

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.303
ELECTRICAL HAZARDS THE DOES

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.806
THESE ITEMS DON'T KNOW. A ZONING

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.808
DISTRICTS THEY DON'T KNOW

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.276
PROPERTY LINES. SO THEY DON'T

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:29.879
CARE SO IS LIVING IN A WAREHOUSE

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.614
OR NOT THEY'LL KILL THEM OR HURT

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.882
THEM JUST THE SAME. SECONDLY IT

01:07:32.948 --> 01:07:35.084
GIVES A JUDGE DISCRETION. TO

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:38.020
GIVE TENANT RELOCATION BENEFITS

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:39.188
THAT ACTUALLY ARE EFFECTIVE I'VE

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:41.056
SEEN CASES WHERE BECAUSE OF THE

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:43.159
STRICT FORMULA IN THE LAW. THE

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:45.127
RELOCATION BENEFITS ARE SO SMALL

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:48.597
NO WE CAN ACTUALLY LIVE ANYWHERE

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:51.867
WITH THAT THAT'S A REAL. CLEAR

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:53.035
HERE. CURRENT LAW AND THIS LAW

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:55.004
DOES NOT CHANGE THIS IS BILL NOT

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:56.172
IT CURRENT LAW SAYS THE ONLY

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:58.073
LAWFUL TENANTS ARE ENTITLED TO

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.708
RELOCATION BENEFITS. THIS DOES

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:02.678
NOT COVER AND WE DO NOT CHANGE

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:03.579
THIS THIS DOES NOT COVER

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:06.148
SQUATTERS OR TRUST PASSERS THIS

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:08.584
IS ONLY PAYING TENANTS. WHO HAVE

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:10.286
BEEN PAYING FOR THE INDIGNITY OF

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:11.887
LIVING IN SUBSTANDARD HOUSING IN

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:14.824
IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT THAT

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.659
UNITIS SUB STANDARD AND NEEDS

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.360
TO BE FIXED UP. THERE IS FOR

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:19.995
SOMEONE TO LIVE IN IT WHILE THE

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.197
OLDER OPEN WHILE LOGICAL ISSUES

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:22.965
ARE BEING REPAIRED AWHILE KISSED

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.233
BY HEAT IS NOT EVEN BEING

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.635
PROVIDED THEY HAVE TO LIVE

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:27.136
SOMEWHERE. ONLY IN THAT

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.637
CIRCUMSTANCE DOES THIS TENANT

01:08:28.704 --> 01:08:30.873
RELOCATION BENEFITS KICK IN AND

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.142
THE ONLY THING THE BILL DOES. IS

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:34.844
GIVE THE JUDGE DISCRETION TO SET

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.879
OF VALUE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.815
FINALLY. THIS MAKES CLEAR THAT

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:42.251
IF A SLUM LORD APPEALS THE ORDER

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:43.986
WHICH IS THEIR RIGHT THIS IS NOT

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.588
CHANGE THAT DUE PROCESS RIGHT.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.289

FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL TO STOP

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.760
THE PROPERTY FOR BEING FIXED UP

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.229
IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY USE A TWO

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:55.130
OR THREE YEAR- PROCESS TO DRAG

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:57.867
OUT A PEEL. IT CANNOT RESULT IN

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:59.168
PEOPLE BEING FORCED FROM THAT

01:08:59.235 --> 01:09:01.504
PROPERTY WHILE THAT CONTINUES SO

01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:02.938
DOES NOT DIMINISH DUE PROCESS

01:09:03.005 --> 01:09:04.940
RIGHTS WHICH IS SACROSANCT. BUT

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:06.475
IT DOES ENSURE THAT THE PROPERTY

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.077
CAN BE FIXED UP WHILE SOMEONE

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:11.480
DOES EXERCISE HIS DUE PROCESS

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:15.117

DOING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:29.870
I'M ALSO A BIG BELIEVER THAT WE

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:31.572
NEED TO BE DOING ONE WORK FORCE

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.674
HOUSING AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:36.477
NOT AN OPINION THAT IS SHARED BY

01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:37.778
EVERYBODY- INSIDE. BY YOU KNOW I

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:39.780
SEE THIS IN MY DISTRICT AND I.

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:40.247
THAT I YOU KNOW I WANT

01:38:40.314 --> 01:38:42.316

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:43.284
FIREFIGHTERS AND TEACHERS AND

01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:44.218
OTHER FOLKS ARE BEING PRICED OUT

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.153
OF SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. TO LIVE

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:48.722
IN MY COMMUNITY AND MANY OF

01:38:48.789 --> 01:38:49.356
THOSE FOLKS DON'T QUALIFY FOR.

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:51.091
LOW INCOME. I DID RESTRICTED

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:51.892
AFFORDABLE. THEY ARE BEING

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:53.394
THEY'RE BEING PRICED OUT OF. BIG

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.729
PARTS OF MY DISTRICT AT A VERY

01:38:55.796 --> 01:38:56.463
RAPID RATE SO I THINK THERE IS.

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:58.299
A REAL PUBLIC POLICY CASE TO

01:38:58.365 --> 01:38:59.400
SUPPORT MISSING THAT'LL WORK FOR

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:00.901
HOUSING. IT'S A GOOD USE OF

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:03.671
TAXPAYER FUNDS TO DO THAT- AND

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:05.739
SO TO ME I WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:39:05.806 --> 01:39:06.273
THAT IS WORK MOVING THIS

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:08.075
PROPOSAL FOR DOING SO- WITH A

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:10.277
LOT OF NEW WANTS BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:11.178
TWO OBJECTIVES HERE I THINK

01:39:11.245 --> 01:39:12.379
IT'S- EXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT WE

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:13.914
ARE GOOD STEWARDS OF PUBLIC

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:14.815
RESOURCES. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:39:14.882 --> 01:39:16.317
TO BE THE THRUST OF YOUR BILL-

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:18.252
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:20.654
WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:21.422
TO. INADVERTENTLY MAKE IT MAKE

01:39:21.488 --> 01:39:22.289
IT MORE DIFFICULT. OR

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:24.091
CHALLENGING OR- A BALL TO

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:26.160
DEVELOP MISSING THAT'LL WORK FOR

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:26.994
HOUSING SO I THINK THE TRICK

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:28.962
HERE IS TO. CRAFT THE GUARDRAILS

01:39:29.029 --> 01:39:30.698
IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE. NOT

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:32.132
PROVIDING ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:33.767
BUT NOT MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE. TO

01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:35.235
DEVELOP THIS HOUSING AND SO. ON

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:37.805
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU'RE

01:39:37.871 --> 01:39:38.972

OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW LOOKING AT

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:43.277
THE MATERIALS THAT PER. THAT

01:39:43.344 --> 01:39:43.811
WERE PROVIDED THIS IS A-

01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:44.878
COMPLICATED TECHNICAL SUBJECT

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.113
AND SO. THE CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.514
YOU'RE HOT. YOU HAVE THEM. BUT

01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:49.149
BUT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:39:49.216 --> 01:39:51.251
ME. YOU KNOW THE- HAD A BILL

01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:52.086

ASSEMBLY BY A VOTE OF SEVENTY

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:58.992
NINE TWO ZERO SO I THINK THERE

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:00.060

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.095

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:07.694
DO AND WHEN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

01:41:07.761 --> 01:41:08.595
AND YES THE DATA. ALAS MARC TO-

01:41:08.662 --> 01:41:10.297
COMMENTED THAT IN THE SECOND

01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:11.231
QUESTION- IS SHOWING SOME

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:12.800
EXCEPTIONS TO THAT THAT'S WHY IT

01:41:12.866 --> 01:41:14.067
WAS NECESSARY TO COME IN AND SAY

01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:15.469
OKAY THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:17.171
CASES WERE YOU'RE USING PUBLIC

01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:18.105
SUBSIDY. AND IN THIS CASE FOR

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:20.707
YOU ARE NOT ACQUIRING ANY- TAX

01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:22.643
AND PROPERTY TAX. BECAUSE USING

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.511
PROPERTY TAX EXEMPT TEAM TAXES

01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:27.648
THAT BONDS. DOT IS IMPORTANT

01:41:27.714 --> 01:41:29.082
THEN FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:31.018
SURE THESE GUARANTEES ARE THERE

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:31.852
. ONLY DELIVER TO ALTERNATELY

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.887
PURDUE AND RENT OUT- THESE UNITS

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:35.823
THAT NEED TO BE THERE FOR THE

01:41:35.889 --> 01:41:38.091
ONE HUNDRED THE ONE TWENTY IN MY

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:39.092
CATEGORY- I KNOW THAT YOU PASSED

01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:41.595
OUT SOME DATA BUT MAYBE WANT TO

01:41:41.662 --> 01:41:43.130
ELABORATE ON THAT AS WELL AGAIN

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:44.298
IT UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR THIS

01:41:44.364 --> 01:41:45.199
BILL. HIS PRIVILEGE THERE ARE AT

01:41:45.265 --> 01:41:47.634
LEAST FORTY TWO OF THESE

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:48.268
DEVELOPMENTS THAT I THINK THAT

01:41:48.335 --> 01:41:49.303
OCCURRED DURING. MR MAS MAY BE

01:41:49.369 --> 01:41:51.371
ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT BUT- WE'VE

01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:52.005
LOOKED AT DATA FOR TWENTY ONE OF

01:41:52.072 --> 01:41:55.576
THEM I THINK WE HAVE GOT. IT ON

01:41:55.642 --> 01:41:56.243
THE RENTS I THINK WE HAVE GOOD

01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:58.378
DATA ON WHAT THE FEES ARE THAT

01:41:58.445 --> 01:42:00.147
ARE BEING CHARGED. AND I THINK

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:01.014
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SORT OF DONE

01:42:01.081 --> 01:42:03.050
THE BAY AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF

01:42:03.116 --> 01:42:04.318
CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS

01:42:04.384 --> 01:42:04.952
TO. SAY YOU KNOW THE PROPERTY

01:42:05.018 --> 01:42:06.720
TAX ABATEMENTS GENTLY WORTH

01:42:06.787 --> 01:42:08.255
ABOUT. 10% AND IT SAVES ABOUT

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:09.223
10% OF YOUR EXPENSES. AND THAT'S

01:42:09.289 --> 01:42:11.758
WHERE WE GET TO THIS FOR A 10%

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:12.893
RATE SAVINGS IN THE BILL THAT

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.294
WE'RE TRYING TO. ACHIEVE AND SO

01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:15.963
THAT'S- THAT'S- WE HAVE

01:42:16.029 --> 01:42:17.030
SIGNIFICANT DATA THERE COULD

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:19.733
ALWAYS BE MORE BUT I THINK

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:20.667
THAT'S A GOOD. START TO. GET

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:22.202
INTO THIS FIELD BEFORE TO GET

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:24.071
AWAY FROM US AND GUESTS TO BE-

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:25.138
YOU KNOW. BUT A POTENTIAL.

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:26.473
PURCHASE IT'S SOMETHING. IN ALL

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:27.975
A HUGE AMOUNT. PROPERTY COULD BE

01:42:28.041 --> 01:42:29.309
TAKEN OFF THE PROPERTY TAX ROLLS

01:42:29.376 --> 01:42:31.345
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:32.679
DOING THAT RIGHT. FROM THE GET

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.214
GO. IT JUST M. E. AWAY AS YOU

01:42:34.281 --> 01:42:35.916
LOOKED AT THOSE TWENTY ONE

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.885
PROPERTIES I MEAN WAS THERE ARE.

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:39.419
AND TRY TO THINK WHAT THE

01:42:39.486 --> 01:42:40.020
DISTRIBUTION OF RENTING WHERE

01:42:40.087 --> 01:42:41.088
THY PRETTY CLUSTERED AND- YOU

01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:42.289
KNOW. SORT OF SIMILAR MODELS AND

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:49.963
ALL OF THEM OR WAS THERE. A

01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:51.999
VARIETY OF WAYS THAT. APPROACH

01:42:52.065 --> 01:42:52.866
THIS. I DO THINK THE VERY. A

01:42:52.933 --> 01:42:55.402
BIT- MISS. MAS MAY. L. S. B. TO

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:56.470
THAT AS- BUT- THERE ARE USUALLY.

01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:58.138
UNITS AT EIGHTY PER. OF A- AGAIN

01:42:58.205 --> 01:43:00.340
THEY CAN. 84% IN AMERICA VERY

01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:00.974
DIFFERENT. WE DO IN THE

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:01.975
TRADITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:43:02.042 --> 01:43:03.310
WORLD. WE THINK OF AFFORDABILITY

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:04.411
AS- THIRTY PERCENT. OF THE

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:05.312
TARGET FAMILIES INCOME. THEY

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:08.582
OFTEN USING 35% OF FAMILIES

01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:09.249
TARGET INCOME. BUT NONE THE LESS

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:11.051
THEY ARE HAVING UNITS AT. ONE

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:12.986
HUNDRED AND- TWENTY. THE ISSUE

01:43:13.053 --> 01:43:13.921
THOUGH IS THAT. THE AS A MAN IN

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:16.056
A REMARKS THE HUNDRED AND 120%

01:43:16.123 --> 01:43:17.257
IN MY RENTS ARE OFTEN WAY ABOVE.

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:19.259
JUST THE NORMAL MARKET. AND SO

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:20.093
IT'S NOT. ME IT'S ONLY SORT F.

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.762
AFFORDABLE IF YOU'RE COMPARING

01:43:21.828 --> 01:43:22.429
IT TO CLASSE LUXURY. PROPERTIES

01:43:22.496 --> 01:43:25.132
KNOCKED IT. IN THE MARKET- YEAH

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:27.668
I GUESS I YOU KNOW I HESITATE TO

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:28.602
USE THE WORD. I SO I. TEACH

01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:32.205
WHERE ABOUT. PRETTY GOOD ACTORS

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:50.791
BUT OUR THEIR- EXAM.

01:44:56.123 --> 01:44:57.958
DON'T KNOW IF THE OPPOSITION.

01:44:58.025 --> 01:45:00.594
HAS ANYTHING TO ADD TO IT TO THE

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:01.228
QUESTIONS I HAD ASKED. FOR I'D

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:03.263
BE HAPPY TO THANK YOU. JUST GET

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:04.297
THAT. UNIT COUNTER THE

01:45:04.364 --> 01:45:06.466
TRANSACTION COUNT. WE DID AN

01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:08.001
AUDIT OF THE ENTIRE. ESSENTIAL

01:45:08.068 --> 01:45:11.505
HOUSING SPACE- ALL OF THESE ARE

01:45:11.571 --> 01:45:12.406
. ALL THESE BONDS ARE PUBLICLY

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:14.074
OFFERED ALL OF THE INFORMATION

IS FREE TO ANYONE WHO'S

01:45:15.809 --> 01:45:17.911
INTERESTED ON THE INTERNET- OUR

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.946
ACCOUNT IS THAT THERE'S BEEN

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:20.547
FORTY SIX TRANSACTIONS THOSE

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:21.815
WOULD BE. BOND FINANCINGS SOME

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:23.617
OF THOSE WERE SMALL PORTFOLIO SO

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:24.618
THERE'S MORE THAN FIFTY ASSETS

01:45:24.685 --> 01:45:27.020
TOTAL. THAT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:29.222
THOUSAND UNITS ACROSS THE STATE-

01:45:29.289 --> 01:45:30.724
THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:33.126
OF NOT EVERYTHING IS. SUPER HIGH

01:45:33.193 --> 01:45:35.529
END LUXURY BRAND NEW PRODUCT- WE

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:37.064
PERSONALLY A CATALYST OVERSEE

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:39.733
WHAT WE CALL VALUE ADDED. THE

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.834
INDUSTRY OR NATURALLY OCCURRING

01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:42.769
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MUCH OLDER

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:44.371
ASSETS WERE A LOT OF MONEY. IT'S

01:45:44.438 --> 01:45:45.772
CHUNK OF THE BOND PROCEEDS ARE

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:47.307
ACTUALLY BE SPENT BEING SPENT ON

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:50.077
UPGRADING SUBSTANTIALLY. THOSE

01:45:50.143 --> 01:45:52.446
THOSE PROPERTIES- I DO THINK

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:54.548
THERE'S A LOT OF COMMON GROUND

01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:56.583
HERE 10% IF YOU WERE TO PICK A

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:59.052
NUMBER AS TO. WHAT TYPE OF RENT

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:00.487
REDUCTION- SHOULD BE HAD FOR A

01:46:00.554 --> 01:46:01.822
PRETTY TAX EXEMPTION TO PROVE

01:46:01.888 --> 01:46:03.123
THE PUBLIC BENEFITS BEEN CREATED

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:06.193
10% SEEMS TO BE A FAIR NUMBER-

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:07.794
ALL I CAN SPEAK TO IS CATALYST

01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:08.762
UNDERWRITING PRACTICES I CAN.

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:10.564
SPEAK TO THE GRANULAR DETAIL

01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:12.265
ACROSS THE FOURTEEN ASSETS THAT

01:46:12.332 --> 01:46:14.801
WE CURRENTLY OVERSEE WHICH IS

01:46:14.868 --> 01:46:15.402
ABOUT FORTY TWO HUNDRED UNITS

01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:16.970
TOTAL WERE ABOUT A THIRD OF THIS

01:46:17.037 --> 01:46:18.772
TOTALLY CO SYSTEM- WE HAD A

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:21.641
THIRD PARTY. MARKET STUDY DONE

01:46:21.708 --> 01:46:23.009
WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE A

01:46:23.076 --> 01:46:24.811
BETTER EVALUATION OF WHAT

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:26.913
CURRENT MARKET RENTS ARE. WITHIN

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.081
ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:29.883
CATALYST OVERSEAS ASSETS ON

01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:31.785
BEHALF OF TWO DIFFERENT J. P.

01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:33.019
AS- IN COMPARISON TO OUR IN

01:46:33.086 --> 01:46:34.821
PLACE RENTS A WE SHIPPED OFF.

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:36.656
THE RENT ROLLS AS OF A CERTAIN

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:38.792
DATE. TO THIS THIRD PARTY MARKET

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:40.093
PROVIDER SO THEY COULD SEE THE-

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.528
THAT WERE BEING PAID THAT CAME

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.163
UP WITH THEIR OWN CONCLUSION.

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.565
THEY LANDED AT A 16% DISCOUNT IT

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:47.667
RIGHT TODAY. AS MARKET RENTS ARE

01:46:47.734 --> 01:46:49.002
DETERMINED TODAY RENTS HAVE

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:50.270
OBVIOUSLY BEEN CLIMBING

01:46:50.337 --> 01:46:51.671
SUBSTANTIALLY ESPECIALLY ON THE

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:53.106
BACK OF CODE AND SOME OF THE

01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:54.641
TENANT PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE

01:46:54.708 --> 01:46:56.510
BEEN PEELED OFF. THAT AMOUNTS TO

01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:57.144
TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR. BILL

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:59.012
SUBSIDY JUST AT ALL PROPERTIES

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:01.848
AGAIN WE'RE ABOUT A THIRD OF

01:47:01.915 --> 01:47:02.516
THIS TOTALLY COOL SYSTEM. WE DO

01:47:02.582 --> 01:47:04.551
SHOOT WHEN WE UNDERWRITE THESE

01:47:04.618 --> 01:47:05.352
ASSETS FOR AT LEAST A 10%

01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:06.987
DISCOUNT TO MARKET RENTS. I

01:47:07.053 --> 01:47:08.655
THINK THE NEW WANTS TO USE THE

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:10.090
WORDTHAT HAS COME UP A COUPLE

01:47:10.157 --> 01:47:12.459
TIMES HERE. IS IN HOW YOU

01:47:12.526 --> 01:47:16.530
CALCULATE MARKET RENTS- WE-

01:47:16.596 --> 01:47:18.298
CALCULATE RENTS YOU KNOW IT WAS

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:18.865
REFERENCE THE THIRTY FIRST.

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:20.801
PERCENT INCOME RATIO. BUT THE

01:47:20.867 --> 01:47:23.703
QUESTION AS TO WHAT YOU'RE

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.305
MULTIPLYING THAT BY WE

01:47:25.372 --> 01:47:26.873
MULTIPLIED BY. COUNTY Y. T. CAC

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.375
FIGURES THAT ARE USED IN

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:29.442
TRADITIONAL CAPITAL A AFFORDABLE

01:47:29.509 --> 01:47:31.344
HOUSING. A LOT OF OUR PROPERTIES

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:33.013
ARE ACTUALLY AT 30% A VERY

01:47:33.079 --> 01:47:35.015
MEDIAN INCOME. WERE AWARE OF THE

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:37.150
FACT THAT SOME OTHERS OF USE 35%

01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:39.820
SOME OF OUR TRANSACTIONS WITH

01:47:39.886 --> 01:47:40.453
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT- BUT I DON'T

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.755
THINK THAT THE METHODOLOGY

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:42.489
THAT'S BEING USED IS

01:47:42.556 --> 01:47:44.825
NONSTANDARD. WE ARE IN SUPPORT

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:47.527
OF A 10% MINIMUM DISCOUNT.

01:47:47.594 --> 01:47:49.696
THERE'S JUST A LOT OF NEW WANTS

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:51.364
AROUND HOW YOU CALCULATE THAT.

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:53.466
WHEN A PROPERTY IS HAD RAPIDLY

01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:54.601
ESCALATING RENTS AND I THINK

01:47:54.668 --> 01:47:56.903
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE THIRD

01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:59.306
PARTY VALIDATED DATA THAT WE CAN

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:00.373
PROVIDE TODAY. THAT WITH THE

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.142
ROCK. RIGHT GROWTH THAT WE ARE

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:03.643
SEEING AND UNFORTUNATELY EXPECT

01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:05.078
TO CONTINUE SEEING GIVEN HOW

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:07.247
DIFFICULT IT IS TO BUILD NEW

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:08.348
SUPPLY IN THE STATE. THAT THIS

01:48:08.415 --> 01:48:10.584
IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A

01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:14.287
MASSIVELY VALUABLE PRESERVATION-TOOL AND OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. IS

01:48:14.354 --> 01:48:17.324
THAT WE QUICKLY LEGISLATE AWAY

01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:18.625
THE ONLY PRESERVATION TOOL THAT

01:48:18.692 --> 01:48:21.228
EXISTS TODAY FOR MIDDLE. EAST

01:48:21.294 --> 01:48:22.495
YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT I

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:24.497
APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK- YOU

01:48:24.564 --> 01:48:26.766
KNOW BY. PROBABLY SPOKEN AND I

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:27.968
THINK EVERYBODY IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:48:28.034 --> 01:48:30.070

THERE'S SOME DETAILS THAT NEED

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:34.908
TO BE WORKED OUT- I THINK WE'RE

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:37.377

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:38.979

SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY WITH

01:48:41.915 --> 01:48:43.717
THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

01:48:43.783 --> 01:48:45.252
COLLEAGUES. AND IS THERE A

TO SECOND BUT YOU KNOW THAT I

01:48:57.998 --> 01:49:00.066
KNOW THIS BILL DOES TRY TO SET

01:49:00.133 --> 01:49:01.902
SOME OF THOSE- PARAMETERS ON HOW

01:49:01.968 --> 01:49:04.004
GPAS AND THEIR PARTNERS CAN USE

01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.638

BONDS TO PURCHASE A MARKET

01:49:07.674 --> 01:49:09.876
HOUSING I THINK ALSO CRITICALLY

01:49:09.943 --> 01:49:11.878
THE BILL DOES THIS BY REQUIRING

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:13.146
INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT RENTS TO

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:14.848
BE MORE DEEPLY AFFORDABLE WHICH

01:49:14.915 --> 01:49:16.216
I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:18.385
ALL TRYING TO GET OUT HERE AND I

01:49:18.451 --> 01:49:20.587

FLEXIBILITY. AFTER THE GPAS AT

01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:24.891
USE THIS MODEL WALK WHILE

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:26.459
CREATING MORE PUBLIC BENEFIT

01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:27.360
THROUGH LOWER RENTS I WOULD JUST

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:29.663
ASK THAT THE- OPPOSITION REALLY

01:49:29.729 --> 01:49:31.431

UNITS USING A SIMILAR APPROACH

01:53:58.731 --> 01:54:00.400
pTO WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:02.769
IN CALIFORNIA OVER 97% OF CITIES

01:54:02.835 --> 01:54:04.304
AND COUNTIES HAVE NOT PRODUCED

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:05.572
ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND

01:54:05.638 --> 01:54:06.673
MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE BURDENED

WHEN. AT TIMES I SALAS A LOT

02:15:05.697 --> 02:15:08.033
WHEN I WAS IN THE COUNCIL SAN

JOSE AT TIMES WHEN IT CAN BE

02:15:09.201 --> 02:15:10.502
CHALLENGING TO FIND AFFORDABLE

02:15:20.745 --> 02:15:22.547
IT HAPPEN- AND- WITHOUT RUNNING

02:15:39.164 --> 02:15:41.299
PART OF THE ARGUMENT AS LITTLE.

02:15:41.366 --> 02:15:42.701
PECULIAR PARTICULARLY THE- LAW

02:15:42.767 --> 02:15:45.036
ON THE- PRODUCTION OF PROPERTY

02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:46.905

02:15:59.317 --> 02:16:00.719
REDUCING SOME OF THOSE LOCAL

02:16:00.785 --> 02:16:02.387

CONCERN ARE ALL FIRST OF ALL

02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:05.844
SETTING UP A NEW AUTHORITY AS

02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:07.812
I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO YOU ABOUT

02:18:07.879 --> 02:18:10.382
WE HAVE MULTIPLE AUTHORITIES

02:18:10.448 --> 02:18:12.484
UNDER THE HOUSING UMBRELLA AND

02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:15.053
WITH THOSE MULTIPLE AUTHORITIES

02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:17.922
WE STILL SEEM TO HAVE. AN ISSUE

02:18:17.989 --> 02:18:19.391
WITH BRINGING FORWARD MORE AND

02:18:19.457 --> 02:18:21.292
MORE LEGISLATION TO STREAMLINE

02:18:21.359 --> 02:18:23.461
TO REDUCE ALL OF THESE THINGS

02:18:23.528 --> 02:18:25.530
AND WE'RE KIND OF STUCK SO TO

02:18:25.597 --> 02:18:28.900
ADD YET ANOTHER AUTHORITY- BY

02:18:28.967 --> 02:18:31.136
THE WAY WE HAVE SO MANY

02:18:31.202 --> 02:18:32.170
AUTHORITIES IN CALIFORNIA I

02:18:32.237 --> 02:18:34.039
CAN'T EVEN COUNT A MALL UNDER

02:18:34.105 --> 02:18:38.143
MANY UMBRELLAS AND THIS CAUSES A

02:18:38.209 --> 02:18:40.211
LOT OF THIS BUREAUCRATIC ISSUE I

02:18:40.278 --> 02:18:42.914
MEAN RIGHT IT CHAIR. OF

02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:44.382
COMMUNICATION AND CONVEYANCING

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:46.284
PULLING BROADBAND ACROSS THE

02:18:46.351 --> 02:18:49.187
STATE SOUNDS GREAT BROADBAND FOR

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:50.822
ALL AND NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH

02:18:50.889 --> 02:18:52.857
MULTIPLE AUTHORITIES AND FINDING

02:18:52.924 --> 02:18:54.392
THAT IT'S NOT SO EASY WHEN YOU

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:57.295
HAVE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS SO

02:18:57.362 --> 02:18:59.597
THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR ME-

02:18:59.664 --> 02:19:01.066
JUST SETTING UP A NEW BOARD IN

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:03.134
YOUR BILL THE FINANCING AND

02:19:03.201 --> 02:19:05.503
START UP COSTS THIS IS ANOTHER

02:19:05.570 --> 02:19:09.274
ISSUE THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE

02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:10.909
ADDRESSED. IT SAYS THE BILL

02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:12.177
STATES THAT THE C. HA HE

02:19:12.243 --> 02:19:14.179
CALIFORNIA HOUSING AUTHORITY NEW

02:19:14.245 --> 02:19:17.716
AUTHORITY. SO NOT. WORKING WITH

02:19:17.782 --> 02:19:19.084
THE OTHER AUTHORITIES BUT THE

02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:21.920
NEW AUTHORITY OPERATE ACCORDING

02:19:21.986 --> 02:19:23.655
TO PRINCIPLES OF REVENUE

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:25.590
NEUTRALITY THOUGH IT DOES NOT

02:19:25.657 --> 02:19:27.325
SPECIFY THE TIME PERIOD OVER

02:19:27.392 --> 02:19:28.793
WHICH REVENUE NEUTRALITY WOULD

02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:32.063
BE ACHIEVED- AND THAT OF COURSE

02:19:32.130 --> 02:19:33.998
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE START UP

02:19:34.065 --> 02:19:36.267
CAPITAL. SO THE START UP CAPITAL

02:19:36.334 --> 02:19:38.103
MEANS WHERE YOU GET GETTING THE

02:19:38.169 --> 02:19:39.137
FUNDS TO START THIS NEW

02:19:39.204 --> 02:19:41.206
AUTHORITY AND IN THE BILL IT

02:19:41.272 --> 02:19:44.876
SAYS OBLIGATION BY. SO IN-

02:19:44.943 --> 02:19:47.145
GETTING THIS THEN YOU WOULD HAVE

02:19:47.212 --> 02:19:48.480
TO HAVE ANOTHER PIECE OF

02:19:48.546 --> 02:19:49.714
LEGISLATION FOR THESE OBLIGATION

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:50.949
BONDS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:54.252
THIRDS. VOTE SO AGAIN I'M JUST

02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:56.287
POINTING THIS OUT BECAUSE AS

02:19:56.354 --> 02:19:58.757
ATTRACTIVE AS THE SET THIS SEEMS

02:19:58.823 --> 02:20:00.692
AN AS MUCH OF A COALITION AS YOU

02:20:00.759 --> 02:20:02.594
HAVE ON BOARD CERTAINLY NOT

02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.796
SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING TO GET IN

02:20:04.863 --> 02:20:07.565
THE WAY. OF THE- BUT WE HAVE TO

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:08.466
BE ABLE TO PEEL THE ONION

02:20:08.533 --> 02:20:11.236
BECAUSE- THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN

02:20:11.302 --> 02:20:12.604
HERE IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN

02:20:12.670 --> 02:20:13.938
ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE KEEP

02:20:14.005 --> 02:20:16.074
MAKING THESE BROAD ATTEMPTS. AND

02:20:16.141 --> 02:20:17.842
THEN WE HAVE YET ANOTHER

02:20:17.909 --> 02:20:20.445
AUTHORITY TO FUND. AND WHEN WE

02:20:20.512 --> 02:20:22.580
HAVE TO FUNDED AUTHORITY WITH

02:20:22.647 --> 02:20:25.283
THE NINE MEMBER PANEL PLUS THE

02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:27.719
EMPLOYEES AND ALL OF THE- ARTS

02:20:27.786 --> 02:20:29.053
THAT IT WOULD TAKE ONCE THE

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:31.156
UNITS ARE BUILT THEY'RE NOT JUST

02:20:31.222 --> 02:20:33.458
BUILT THEY HAVE TO BE SUSTAINED.

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:34.926
SO YOU'VE ADDRESSED THE WORK

02:20:34.993 --> 02:20:36.594
FORCE TO BUILD THEM BUT THEN

02:20:36.661 --> 02:20:38.296
THERE'S ALSO THE SUSTAINABILITY

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:40.398
AND ALL TOO OFTEN AND PUBLIC

02:20:40.465 --> 02:20:42.433
HOUSING THAT WE'VE SEN ACROSS

02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:44.169
THE STATE OF CRIME CALIFORNIA.

02:20:44.235 --> 02:20:47.972
THERE ARE SOME DIRE IMAGES OF

02:20:48.039 --> 02:20:50.742
WHAT WE CALL PROJECTS. AND WHAT

02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:52.911
HAPPENED AND HE'S COUNTIES WHEN

02:20:52.977 --> 02:20:56.714
THEY WEREN'T SUSTAINED. SO THAT

02:20:56.781 --> 02:21:00.385
THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT I

02:21:00.451 --> 02:21:01.920
CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE

02:21:01.986 --> 02:21:03.621
OPPORTUNITIES AND YOU'VE HEARD

02:21:03.688 --> 02:21:05.523
MAYBE A BROKEN RECORD UP HERE I

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:07.192
MEAN WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE

02:21:07.258 --> 02:21:08.760
HOUSING WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE

02:21:08.827 --> 02:21:11.763
HOUSING BUT- WHEN WE ADD

02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:13.832
ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES I MEAN I

02:21:13.898 --> 02:21:15.366
YEAH I THINK IN THIS AGENDA WE

02:21:15.433 --> 02:21:17.135
HAVE THREE TYPES OF AUTHORITIES

02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:19.137
THAT WE COULD BE APPROVING SO

02:21:19.204 --> 02:21:21.005
I'M JUST MAKING THOSE COMMENTS-

02:21:21.072 --> 02:21:23.308
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT AS THIS

02:21:23.374 --> 02:21:24.876
MOVES FORWARD THOSE THINGS ARE

02:21:24.943 --> 02:21:27.545
SERIOUS. ISSUES THE FINANCING OF

02:21:27.612 --> 02:21:29.347
THE AUTHORITY THE BONDING OF THE

02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:32.083
STORY AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:34.552
THESE UNITS- IF AND WHEN THEY

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:35.854
GET BILLED BECAUSE HOPEFULLY

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.655
THAT IS THE END RESULT THAT

02:21:37.722 --> 02:21:40.792
THERE ARE. MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF

02:21:40.859 --> 02:21:42.794
AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT LIKE WE

02:21:42.861 --> 02:21:43.828
TALKED ABOUT ANOTHER WE DON'T

02:21:43.895 --> 02:21:45.964
WANT TO JUST BUILD SOMETHING IF

02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:47.599
WE CAN'T SUSTAIN IT. BECAUSE WE

02:21:47.665 --> 02:21:51.502
DON'T SUSTAIN IT THEN WE HAVE-

02:21:51.569 --> 02:21:53.338
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT

02:21:53.404 --> 02:21:54.906
THE FIRST YEAR IT'S BUILT BUT

02:21:54.973 --> 02:21:57.175
TEN YEARS DOWN TWENTY YEARS DOWN

02:21:57.242 --> 02:21:59.010
THIRTY YEARS WHAT IS THAT GOING

02:21:59.077 --> 02:22:00.311
TO LOOK LIKE SO THAT'S MY

02:22:00.378 --> 02:22:01.880
QUESTION THAT IS NOT REALLY

02:22:01.946 --> 02:22:04.382

HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS I

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:15.713
THINK IS PART OF THE SOLUTION I

02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:16.481
THINK INVOLVING VARIOUS

02:24:16.547 --> 02:24:18.082
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS NOT ONLY

02:24:18.149 --> 02:24:19.817
IN HOUSING COMMITTEE- BUT ALSO

02:24:19.884 --> 02:24:23.855
AND BUDGET. TO INSURE THAT WE'RE

02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:25.023

CALIFORNIA SOCIAL HOUSING IS AN

02:24:30.862 --> 02:24:32.864
ANSWER TO THAT- I ENVY OTHER

02:24:32.930 --> 02:24:33.498
CITIES THAT HAVE MORE SPACE.

02:24:33.564 --> 02:24:34.132
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:36.968
PART OF THE CONVERSATION I GETS

02:24:37.035 --> 02:24:38.703

02:24:38.770 --> 02:24:40.371
THE POTENTIAL AND OPPORTUNITIES

02:24:40.438 --> 02:24:43.875

02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:07.945
I THINK. THIS SUMMER QUIRK-SILVA

02:28:08.012 --> 02:28:09.480
DOES BRING ABOUT CONCERNS ABOUT

02:28:09.547 --> 02:28:10.982
IT. AND THIS IS KIND OF THE

02:28:11.048 --> 02:28:12.250
GRAND VISION AND I THINK THE

02:28:12.316 --> 02:28:14.318
FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING SOCIAL

02:28:14.385 --> 02:28:15.620
HOUSING IS WE HAVE TO CREATE THE

02:28:15.686 --> 02:28:17.221
FRAMEWORK FIRST. AND THEN IN THE

02:28:17.288 --> 02:28:18.522
LARGER STRATEGY DESCRIBING.

02:28:18.589 --> 02:28:19.890
ITSELF TO GO OUT FOR BOND AND

02:28:19.957 --> 02:28:21.592
HOPEFULLY GO OUT FOR ALL THESE

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:23.227
OTHER MEASURES TO IT BECAUSE I

02:28:23.294 --> 02:28:24.762
THINK THIS IS THE FIRST

02:28:24.829 --> 02:28:25.429
COMPREHENSIVE SEVEN I'VE ALWAYS

02:28:25.496 --> 02:28:27.965
BEEN VERY TRANSPARENT THERE ONE

02:28:28.032 --> 02:28:28.633
THAT I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST.

02:28:28.699 --> 02:28:30.201
IN A SERIES OF ORDER OF

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:31.202
OPERATIONS. AND I THINK IT'S

02:28:31.269 --> 02:28:32.570
IMPORTANT THAT WE REPLICATE. NOT

02:28:32.637 --> 02:28:33.838
JUST SO WE SEE THE POSTER CHILD

02:28:33.904 --> 02:28:36.440
IN VIENNA AND IN EUROPE BUT ALSO

02:28:36.507 --> 02:28:37.241
LOOK AT ASIA WHICH WE DO

02:28:37.308 --> 02:28:38.709
INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE IN

02:28:38.776 --> 02:28:40.344
SINGAPORE AS WELL- BECAUSE THESE

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:41.178
MODELS HAVE EXISTED- JUST AS

02:28:41.245 --> 02:28:43.147
LONG AS THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT

02:28:43.214 --> 02:28:44.515
US PUBLIC HOUSING HAS EXISTED IF

02:28:44.582 --> 02:28:45.082
NOT LONGER. AND THERE IS A

02:28:45.149 --> 02:28:46.050
REASON PARTICULAR REASONS WHY WE

02:28:46.117 --> 02:28:48.219
IN THIS COUNTRY FAILED. AND HOW

02:28:48.286 --> 02:28:49.520
THAT'S RACISM. AND APART AND WHY

02:28:49.587 --> 02:28:50.221
YOU KNOW OTHER PLACES THEY

02:28:50.288 --> 02:28:52.256
SUCCEEDED WHICH IS JUST AS LONG.

02:28:52.323 --> 02:28:53.224
AND IF WE LEARN FROM OUR

02:28:53.291 --> 02:28:55.293
MISTAKES THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE A

02:28:55.359 --> 02:28:56.260
SUSTAINABLE TO MAKE THEM

02:28:56.327 --> 02:28:57.495
BEAUTIFUL MAKE THE MIXING COMING

02:28:57.561 --> 02:28:58.429
NOT CONCENTRATION POVERTY AND

02:28:58.496 --> 02:29:00.231
MAKE THEM AS- OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:01.999
MY FOLKS. AND WE CAN BUILD MORE

02:29:02.066 --> 02:29:02.967
HOUSING THAT'S NOT JUST FOR

02:29:03.034 --> 02:29:04.568
PROFIT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. IN OUR

02:29:04.635 --> 02:29:06.404
BEST INTENTIONS WE ONLY HAVE TO

02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:07.972
RELY ON THE PRIVATE MARKET AS

02:29:08.039 --> 02:29:09.240
THE MAJORITY WERE HOUSING AND

02:29:09.307 --> 02:29:10.875
THEY ALWAYS DO IT. WITH A PROFIT

02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:12.677
MARGIN AND THAT'S JUST THAT'S

02:29:12.743 --> 02:29:14.045
JUST NATURE OF THE GAME RIGHT.

02:29:14.111 --> 02:29:15.913
BUT IF WE CAN BUILD HOUSING IS A

02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:17.515
PUBLIC COULD. AND THAT MONEY

02:29:17.581 --> 02:29:18.115
GETS RECYCLED BACK INTO THE

02:29:18.182 --> 02:29:19.083

WHILE ALSO KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY

02:34:54.652 --> 02:34:56.854
SAFE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED TWELVE

02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:59.289

NOT ONLY WILL IT TAKE TIME MONEY

02:35:40.497 --> 02:35:41.832
AND THE USE OF OUR ALREADY

02:35:41.899 --> 02:35:43.300

COMMITMENT TO TRYING TO MAKE

OF THE STATE. I AM SURE ALL DAY

02:52:08.651 --> 02:52:11.187

HOUSING PRICES WENT UP TWELVE

02:52:18.461 --> 02:52:20.096
POINT THREE PERCENT. ALMOST

02:52:20.163 --> 02:52:21.197
DOUBLE THAT RIGHT HERE IN

02:52:21.264 --> 02:52:23.332
SACRAMENTO WHICH IS SIMILAR TO

02:52:23.399 --> 02:52:25.568
OTHER SMALL METRO AREAS. BUT

02:52:25.635 --> 02:52:27.904
TEACHERS SALARIES BY CONTRAST

02:52:27.970 --> 02:52:30.673
WENT UP ONE POINT SIX PERCENT.

02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:32.075
THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE

02:52:32.141 --> 02:52:34.911
INCREASINGLY UNABLE TO AFFORD

02:52:34.977 --> 02:52:36.646
THE HOUSING THEY NEED TO SERVE

02:52:36.713 --> 02:52:37.980
THEIR DISTRICTS AND TO LIVE NEAR

02:52:38.047 --> 02:52:40.016
THEIR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND

02:52:40.083 --> 02:52:42.819
JOBS- THE RECRUITMENT AND

02:52:44.053 --> 02:52:45.655
INCREASINGLY SERIOUS PROBLEM

02:52:45.722 --> 02:52:48.424
WITH 75% OF CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS

02:52:48.491 --> 02:52:50.126
REPORTING PROBLEMS WITH

02:52:50.193 --> 02:52:52.962
RECRUITMENT. ONE OF THE MOST

02:52:53.029 --> 02:52:54.897
COMMON REASONS THAT CALIFORNIA

02:52:54.964 --> 02:52:56.833
TEACHERS- GIVE FOR LEAVING OUR

02:52:56.899 --> 02:52:58.367
STATE IS THE HIGH COST OF

02:52:58.434 --> 02:52:59.936
HOUSING AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY

02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:01.938
TRUE FOR ENTRY LEVEL TEACHERS

02:53:02.004 --> 02:53:03.139
AND IF IT'S TRUE FOR ENTRY LEVEL

02:53:03.206 --> 02:53:05.274
TEACHERS. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW

02:53:05.341 --> 02:53:06.843
UNATTAINABLE HOUSING IS FOR THE

02:53:06.909 --> 02:53:09.112
CLASSIFIED STAFF WHO KEEP OUR

SECRETARIES AND CAFETERIA

02:53:13.249 --> 02:53:17.386
WORKERS. IN OUR RESEARCH WE

02:53:17.453 --> 02:53:20.656
FOUND THAT THERE ARE ELEVEN

02:53:20.723 --> 02:53:22.859
THOUSAND ALMOST DISTRICT OWNED

02:53:22.925 --> 02:53:25.461

02:53:25.528 --> 02:53:27.830
AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES AND

02:53:27.897 --> 02:53:29.499
EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THOSE ARE

02:53:29.565 --> 02:53:30.867
ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY DEVELOPER

02:53:30.933 --> 02:53:33.770
WILL LANDS- THAT'S TE SIZE OF

02:53:33.836 --> 02:53:35.872
SIX MANHATTAN'S AND WHEN WE LOOK

02:53:35.938 --> 02:53:37.206

02:53:37.273 --> 02:53:39.375

02:53:39.442 --> 02:53:41.811
RESOURCE THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:53:41.878 --> 02:53:43.713
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. AS

THERE'S NEW DEMAND FOR THIS

02:54:23.085 --> 02:54:27.156
THAT'S REALLY OVERWHELMING AND-

02:54:27.223 --> 02:54:28.724
A LOT OF THIS COMES FROM THE

02:54:28.791 --> 02:54:31.060
FACT. THAT IT TAKES SEVEN TO

02:54:31.127 --> 02:54:34.130
NINE YEARS TO MOVE THROUGH THE

02:54:34.197 --> 02:54:35.898

LIKE WHAT ABOUT HOUSING AND HOW

03:36:01.315 --> 03:36:03.417
DOES IT WORK TOGETHER. SO MY

03:36:03.483 --> 03:36:05.152
UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT IN THE

03:36:05.218 --> 03:36:07.554
CREATION OF THIS COUNCIL IN THE

03:36:07.621 --> 03:36:09.323

HOUSING ON ON ALMOST NIS. AND IT

03:36:30.444 --> 03:36:33.146
ALSO CREATED A PROCESS TO STRING

03:36:33.213 --> 03:36:34.147
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HOUSING

03:36:34.214 --> 03:36:35.882
AND SERVICES A CONNECTION THAT

03:36:35.949 --> 03:36:37.784
IS MISSING WHEN THE TWO.

03:36:37.851 --> 03:36:40.187
AGENCIES OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY.

03:36:40.253 --> 03:36:42.689

CREATING A NEW POSITION. THAT

03:36:58.004 --> 03:37:01.341

CABINET POSITION RIGHT NOW IT'S

03:39:17.310 --> 03:39:20.213
A DIRECTOR SIMILAR TO THE

03:39:20.280 --> 03:39:23.116
DIRECTOR OF YES RIGHT THAT. THE

03:39:23.183 --> 03:39:24.784

EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION- THE

03:39:29.656 --> 03:39:31.758
COUNCIL DOES HAVE LEGISLATIVE

03:39:31.825 --> 03:39:34.160
OVERSIGHT FROM WHEN IT WAS

03:39:34.227 --> 03:39:36.663

03:39:59.386 --> 03:40:00.186
. GENERALLY I'M TRYING TO

03:40:00.253 --> 03:40:02.355
UNDERSTAND HOW WE WOULD OPERATE

03:40:02.422 --> 03:40:04.491
WHETHER IT'S THE CREATION OF A

03:40:04.558 --> 03:40:06.159

03:40:07.561 --> 03:40:09.496
SUBMERSION OF VARIOUS DIFFERENT

03:40:09.563 --> 03:40:12.666

INDIVIDUAL- IT DONE OFFICE. THE

03:40:15.468 --> 03:40:18.538
DIRECTOR WOULD SERVE AS A CORNER

03:40:18.605 --> 03:40:20.974
COORDINATOR AMONGST THESE

03:40:21.041 --> 03:40:22.342
AGENCIES THE PROGRAMS WOULD

03:40:22.409 --> 03:40:25.011
STILL BE PART OF THOSE AGENCIES

03:40:25.078 --> 03:40:26.079
AND ADMINISTERED BY THOSE

03:40:26.146 --> 03:40:29.015
AGENCIES SIMILAR TO WHAT LIKE I

03:40:29.082 --> 03:40:29.950

03:40:30.016 --> 03:40:32.752
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IS

03:40:32.819 --> 03:40:34.487
WHICH- WE HAVE THE SAME NAME.

03:40:34.554 --> 03:40:37.090
AND I KNOW IT IT WAS INSPIRED BY

03:40:37.157 --> 03:40:39.159
THE FEDERAL AGENCY LAST YEAR

03:40:39.225 --> 03:40:42.162

FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. BUT

03:40:46.900 --> 03:40:49.436
THE ONLY THING WE DIDN'T DO WAS

03:40:49.502 --> 03:40:52.706
STRUCTURE IT THE SAME AS THE

03:40:52.772 --> 03:40:57.510

03:45:19.539 --> 03:45:21.307
ALREADY PART OF THE FRAMEWORK ON

03:45:21.374 --> 03:45:23.276
HOLD LEGISLATIVE OVER YOU KNOW

03:45:23.343 --> 03:45:24.477
THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THAT

THEY HAVE. RIGHT SO IT'S ALREADY

03:45:29.315 --> 03:45:31.684
PART OF THIS COUNCIL. BUT THE

03:45:31.751 --> 03:45:33.519

03:45:33.586 --> 03:45:35.521
NEW POSITION THE DIRECTOR THE

REPORTS TO THE GOVERNOR IS A

03:45:38.091 --> 03:45:40.226
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENTITY. SO

03:45:40.293 --> 03:45:41.895
THAT'S THAT'S WHERE IT'S

03:45:41.961 --> 03:45:46.633
DIFFERENT THAN THE COUNCIL. BUT

03:45:46.699 --> 03:45:49.202
THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAVE MORE OF

03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:51.170
POWER RIGHT TO COORDINATE

03:45:51.237 --> 03:45:52.839
BECAUSE CURRENTLY THERE'S A

03:45:52.906 --> 03:45:54.741

03:46:01.481 --> 03:46:03.283
DIRECTOR WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO

03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:05.451
MORE OF THE OTHER AGENCIES RIGHT

03:46:05.518 --> 03:46:08.721

OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

03:46:17.297 --> 03:46:19.165
SUBCOMMITTEES. THEN THE

03:46:19.232 --> 03:46:20.800
CONVERSATIONS CAN POTENTIALLY BE

03:46:20.867 --> 03:46:23.236
STILL IN SILOS IF YOU'RE WORKING

HOME KEY SOME I'M TRYING TO

03:46:35.381 --> 03:46:37.116
UNDERSTAND AGAIN JUST SIMPLY

03:46:37.183 --> 03:46:38.785
WHERE THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE

03:46:38.851 --> 03:46:41.087
LEGISLATURE WOULD BE IF THIS ONE

03:46:41.154 --> 03:46:42.555
INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE VARIOUS

03:46:42.622 --> 03:46:45.525

04:21:35.179 --> 04:21:37.715
HARDER ABOUT WHO THEY INVITE TO
