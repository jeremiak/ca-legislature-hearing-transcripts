RUBIO HERE SALAS RESIDENTS SMITH HERE TO RECORD WELL CAN MISTER COOPER PLEASE NOTE THE BILL. WELL AB ELEVEN THIRTY THREE PASSES COMMITTEE THE BILL ADDRESS EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF THOROUGHBRED HORSE RACING. IN THE SENATE I MOVE THE BILL TO REMOVE THE THOROUGHBRED RACING PROVISION AND INSTEAD ADDRESS THE PROCESS FOR DETERMINING COMPENSATION PAID THE LICENSE ACCOUNT WAGERING SERVICE PROVIDERS. FOR PROCESSING WAITERS ALIVE COURSE RACES INCLUDES AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE WOULD CLARIFY THAT THE DECISION OF THE ARBITRATOR IS NOT FINAL AND BINDING BROTHER SAID TO ISSUE REVIEW. AND WHAT AT A STANDARD FOR THE ARBITRATOR TO PLAN REACHING HIS OR HER DECISION. THIS PROVISION WAS SUGGESTED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD. THE BILL ALSO MODIFY THE RATE OF COMPENSATION TO BE PAID BY THE COMPANY PROCESSING THE WAGERS DURING THE ARBITRATION IN ANY SUBSEQUENT COURT CHALLENGES. FOR THE SUCH INTERMARRY OF COMPENSATION IS FAIR TO ALL PARTIES. I WOULDN'T SAY WITH ME TODAY IS THE SCOTT LET. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN A MEMBER SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES TURF CLUB THE PACIFIC RACING ASSOCIATION SANTA ANITA PARK IN GOLDEN GATE FIELDS. MEMBERS MAKE NO MISTAKE. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE IS ABOUT PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S HORSE RACING INDUSTRY. AND ITS THOUSANDS OF UNIONIZED WORKERS FROM BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY OUT OF STATE INTERNET ADVANCE DEPOSIT WAGERING COMPANIES. SINCE EIGHTY W. WAS FIRST AUTHORIZED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO SECTION NINETEEN SIX OH FOUR HAS PROVIDED CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING ENTITIES WHO ARE NOT SIGNATORY TO AN EIGHTY W. HUB AGREEMENT. THE RIGHT TO TRIGGER BINDING ARBITRATION IF A PAYMENT DISPUTE ARISES. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WITH THE COVERT PANDEMIC THE PERCENTAGE OF WAGERS MADE THROUGH ADW SKYROCKETED. CONSEQUENTLY THE CONTRACTS IN PLACE DID NOT FAIRLY COMPENSATE ALL PARTICIPANTS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT THE ARBITRATION PROVISION WAS APPROPRIATELY TRIGGER. UNFORTUNATELY ONE OUT OF STATE EIGHTY W. PROVIDER ATTEMPTING TO HANG ON TO THEIR WINDFALL PROFITS SUED TO OVERTURN THE CALIFORNIA STATUTE ON TO CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. THAT THE STATUTE FAILED TO PROVIDE DUE PROCESS BY NOT PROVIDING ARBITRATORS WE STANDARDS TO BASE A DECISION. AND SECONDLY IT DID NOT AFFORD PARTIES ARE RIGHT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE REMEDIES THESE TWO LEGAL QUESTIONS. WITHOUT AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE BECOMING LAW THE CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY AND ITS WORKERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AT THE MERCY OF OUT OF STATE COMPANIES WHOSE ONLY INTEREST IS EXTRACTING AS MUCH PROFIT FROM CALIFORNIA AS POSSIBLE I WOULD URGE YOU TO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER WHICH THE MOVE ON TO MISTER HAVE YOU LEAVE MODERATORS MISTER OF YOU'LL BE ON THE LINE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS GREG ANNUALLY THE PRESS THOROUGHBRED OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA. I REPRESENT SEVEN THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN WHO OWNED THOROUGHBRED RACEHORSES IN THIS GREAT STATE. THIS BILL IS A TECHNICAL FIX AS MR WEBB JUST TESTIFIED WHEN THE THOROUGHBRED OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA SOUGHT TO EXERCISE THE ARBITRATION RIGHTS THAT ARE IN THE STATE IN THE HORSERACING LAW. CHURCHILL DOWNS FILED A FEDERAL LAWSUIT SAYING THAT THE THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE LAW IN PARTICULAR THAT THE ARBITRATION STANDARD WAS NOT REVIEWABLE BY A COURT THAT MADE IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL WE ATTEMPTED TO HAVE THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAY AND THEIR ADVICE TO US WHICH I BELIEVE IS IN THE RECORD. IS THAT HOW WE SHOULD GO AHEAD AND I'M AMEND THE STATUTES SUCH THAT THE FINAL ARBITRATION DECISION WAS IN FACT REVIEWABLE BY A COURT OF LAW IN ADDITION TO MORE CLEARLY SPECIFIED STANDARD THE ARBITRATION BUT A BUTTERFLY WHICH IS BEEN DONE- INTENDED SPELL. WE ARE TO PASSAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR. SO WHAT WILL NOW MOVE ON TO IS THE OPPOSITION WE HAVE A LISTED IS- JOHN NORWOOD. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF CHURCHILL DOWNS- WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL ROBISON YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT PROVIDE FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. HAS INDICATED THAT WAS RAISED IN OUR LAWSUIT HOWEVER WE QUESTION THE OTHER AMENDMENTS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS SKEW THE PROCESS IN THE FAVOR OF THE INTERVENOR. UNDER CURRENT LAW- THERE'S A CERTAIN PRESUMPTION GIVEN TO THE RATE OF PAY THAT IS BECAUSE SHE'S IN THE HAVE A GREAT NOT BECAUSE IT WAS THE GOSHEN ARM'S LENGTH WITH IT WITH A TRACK. WITH THIS BILL DOES IS CHANGE DURING DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE ARBITRATION COURT CHANGES THAT NUMBER- FROM THE WHAT'S BEING WHAT WAS ALLOWED IN THE HAVE AREEMENT TO AN AVERAGE BETWEEN WHAT WAS STATED IN THE AGREEMENT AND WHAT THE INTERVENOR ONCE WE THINK THAT'S- PREJUDICES- THE ARBITRATOR. AND PUTS IN THEIR MIND THAT SOMETHING LESS IS WARRANTED ONE THAT MAY NOT BE THE CASE AT ALL ACTUALLY IN THIS CASE THE- AMOUNT THAT WAS- BEEN AT THE RETURN HAVE AGREEMENT RATE WAS WHICH IS TRADITIONALLY BEEN CHARGED- IN ADDITION THIS BILL TRIES TO SET FORTH A STANDARD FOR THE ARBITRATOR LOOK AT. AND IN FAIRNESS THAT WAS AN ISSUE RAISED IN OUR LAWSUIT. HOWEVER- THE STANDARD THIS PUT IN THEIR BASE LOOKS AT CAL. FAN AND THE RATE- EIGHTY W. PROVIDERS ARE BEING PAID IN CALIFORNIA- TRADITIONALLY CHURCHILL DOWNS HAS BEEN ABLE TO NEGOTIATE. A HIGHER RATE BASICALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BETTER PRODUCT- SO THE WAY THIS STANDARD WORKS. ESSENTIALLY IS THAT NOW IN ARBITRATION BILL THEIR PRODUCT IS VIEWED THE SAME AS A SUB STANDARD PRODUCT THE STRUGGLE A LOWER RATE- LASTLY. I THINK THE IDEA OF THE STATUTE ALL ALONG WAS TO PROVIDE THAT IF THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THAT INTERFERE COULD COME IN AND- NO BECAUSE A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH COUNTERED AGREEMENT THERE. THE WAY THE STATURE ACTUALLY WORKS OUT I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT'S EVER BEEN USED IN FIFTEEN YEARS- ON THE BOOKS IS THAT- YOU CAN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE- AS AN ART OF WITH THE RATE BEING PAID WAS THE SAME IT'S ALWAYS BEEN PAID. THERE'S NO REALLY ISSUE AT ALL BUT YOU CAN HAVE AN INTERVENOR THAT FOR INSTANCE- YOU KNOW DOESN'T LIKE SOMETHING ELSE YOU'RE DOING IN THE MARKET PLACE. AND SO TO MESS WITH YOU THEY WANTED THEY BASICALLY BECAUSE AN INTERVENTION IN THIS AND THREATEN AN INTERVENTION THAT'S IN FACT WHAT KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED. IN THIS SITUATION I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THE STATUTE WAS INTENDED TO DO. YOU KNOW- IN THE- IN THE END- I THINK ONE OF THE WITNESSES EXPERT WITNESSES IN THE SENATE SAID. THIS BILL BUT ON THE- ARE THE STATUES BROWN THE BOOKS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND PRINT FAIR AT ALL. WELL THAT'S THE CASE THEN OTHER THAN CHANGING THE- APPEAL ISSUE WHY ARE WE MAKING THESE OTHER CHANGES. AND WHY ARE YOU MAKING THESE CHANGES. IN THE PROCESS OF A GUT AND AMEND WHERE YOU LIMIT. A FULL DEBATE WHEN EVERYBODY KNEW. THIS WAS IT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE SECTION WAY BEFORE. THE AG'S OPINION IN MARCH. SO THERE IS NO REASON AT ALL WHY THIS BILL COULDN'T GOT THROUGH THE REGULAR PROSTOR WHAT I'M ASK YOU TO WRAP UP PLEASE. THANK YOU.
