AREN'T OFFICIALLY MEMBERS OF THE G. L. B. C. -- AND IT'S AT THE DISCRETION OF THE CHAIR TO ALLOW MEMBERS TO JOIN US AT THE DAY YES AND YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME SAUL. AND BIDED ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRASIER TO PLEASE COME JOIN US. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME ALL MY COLLEAGUES ON AND EVERYONE ON AS WELL AS OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE JOINING US TODAY. ON ANTAR WITNESSES THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. APPRECIATE YOU FOR BEING HERE I APPRECIATE -- ALL OF THE PERSPECTIVES ON THAT WE WILL HEAR TODAY IN THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THIS HEARING. AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW IS UNUSUAL FOR THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE JAIL BC. MOST OF OUR WORK INVOLVED BEHIND THE SCENES OVERSIGHT. OVERSIGHT NONE THE LESS WE REVIEW MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES ARE PROPOSED TO THE STATE BUDGET WHICH IS WHY I HAVE -- SENATOR MITCHELL I ASSURE THE SET BUDGET COMMITTEE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO CHAIR THE T. L. B. C.. I'LL GIVE YOU A RECENT EXAMPLE AT THE END OF LAST WEEK CAL FIRED NOTIFIED US OF THE REQUEST TO INCREASE THEIR EMERGENCY FIRE SUPPRESSION BUDGET. BY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. OF COURSE WE'RE ALL AWARE THE CRITICAL SITUATION FACING OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE GROUND WITH ALL OF THESE CRISES THAT WE CAN'T SEEM TO EX GAY. IT'S PART OF THE GOP SEES ROLE TO HELP MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE. FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO SUCH AS THESE I MERRY ROLE AT THE JAIL BC TO BE ABLE TO ALLOCATE FUNDS KIND OF MID BUDGET CYCLE. TODAY'S HEARING AS YOU ALL ARE AWARE AS ABOUT THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH IS OPERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. THIS SEVEN HUNDRED MILE LONG WATER STORAGE AND DELIVERY SYSTEM PROVIDES WATER TO TWENTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE AND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND. MOST OF THE COST OF THE PROJECT ARE FUNDED THROUGH TWENTY NINE LONG TERM WATER SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN MAY OF THIS YEAR THE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIED THE JAIL BC OF ITS INTENT TO RENEW THOSE CONTRACTS. NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE PROPOSED CONTRACT EXTENSIONS BEGAN BACK IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN UNDER STATE LAW THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO PRESENT THOSE PROPOSED CONTRACT RENEWALS IN AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING BEFORE THE GOP SEE. TODAY'S HEARING SERVES AS THE ROOT HEARING REQUIRED BY THAT STATE LAW. TODAY'S HEARING HOWEVER IS NOT THE FIRST LEGISLATIVE HEARING ON THE SUBJECT. ON JULY THIRD TO FINISH NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING ON THE SAME SUBJECT WHERE THE PROPOSED CONTRACT A MEMBERS WERE REVIEWED AND DISCUSS AND THE PUBLIC WAS INVITED TO TESTIFY. IN ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE BUT I SURE THE GOP SEE I SAT IN ON THAT FULL HEARING. THIS HEARING IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION AMENDMENTS WE WILL NOT BE TAKING ANY ACTIONS ARE VOTE BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. REQUIRED BY LAW. AND WHILE THE WATER FIXER DELTA TUNNELS PROJECT IN ITS FINANCING ARE OF GREAT INTEREST TO ALL OF YOU HAVE GATHERED TODAY AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE -- TODAY'S HEARING DOES NOT AUTHORIZE OR PREVENT THE WATER FIX PROJECT FROM MOVING FORWARD. NOR ARE WE VOTING ON THE DETAILS. OF WHO WOULD PAY FOR THE WATER FIX IF INDEED IT DOES MOVE FORWARD. THERE ARE SEVERAL LEGAL REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL PROPHECIES THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE WATER FIX PROJECT COULD MOVE FORWARD. AND THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO BE FULLY ENGAGED IN EVERY STEP ALONG THAT PROCESS. THIS HEARING DOES NOT CHANGE OR SHORT CUT THOSE REQUIREMENTS. AND THE POLICY IN THE SCHOOL COMMITTEES OF THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONDUCT FURTHER OVERSIGHT. AS THOSE PROPHECIES UNFOLD HEY AS WE FOCUS ON OVERSIGHT OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACT EXTENSION AMENDMENTS WE WILL BEGIN WITH TESTIMONY FROM THE EL AL'S OFFICE. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS -- AND WE WILL ALLOW EVERYONE WHO'S HERE WHOSE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. WITH THAT -- I WOULD ASK MEMBERS OF THE JAIL BC COMMITTEE IF YOU HAVE OPENING COMMENTS. OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE JOINED US HERE TODAY CAN PROVIDE ANY OPENING COMMENTS AND FEEL FREE TO ENGAGE IN FULL DISCUSSION -- WHEN WITNESSES COME FORWARD BUT WE'LL ASK ONLY THAT SEE THAT MEMBERS OF THE JAIL BC I WAS NOT INFORMED FROM -- IS SIMPLY RULED THAT ANYONE WAS APPOINTED TO REPLACE THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE OFFICIALLY. IT'LL WORK ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU AS OUR GUEST DOCTOR PAN YOU'D LIKE TO PROVIDE OPENING COMMENT. AND THEN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MINING THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I JUST WANT -- TO FIRST OF ALL MAKE NOTES AND I THINK. OUR CHAIR -- FOR FOR ACTUALLY -- THIS I KNOW THIS HEARING WAS PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED TWO WEEKS AGO AND TO AND AND AND THE FOURTEEN THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR MEMBERS LIKE ME LIKE MYSELF TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THE MATERIALS IN PREPARATION AND SO I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR FOR FOR DOING THAT AND REALIZE THAT NOT THAT REQUIRED YOU TO NOW TRAVELS BACK UP SACRAMENTO AFTER SPENDING. A LOT OF TIME IN SACRAMENTO ALL OF US TOGETHER -- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE OF THAT AND I LOOK VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING OUR WITNESSES -- WHO ARE GONNA BE COMING UP AND PARTICULARLY FROM THE WATER RESOURCES -- CERTAINLY THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS ONE THAT'S CRITICAL -- TO THE STATE SOME. PROJECT THAT -- AND THAT IT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON ON THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING MY CONSTITUENTS -- APPRECIATE THE THE CHAIRS REMARKS -- ABOUT THE NEED. TO HAVE THIS HEARING SO WE CAN HEAR ABOUT THESE CONTRACT MINUTES BUT ALSO. ABOUT THIS THE STATE WATER FIX IT WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT -- I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE -- KLAY MAIN BY CONSTITUENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT -- AND AND I THINK IN MANY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FOR AGAIN FROM THE PRESENTATIONS. I THINK WHAT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY AND AND AND THAT -- WE EXPECT THE AGENCIES TO BE VERY UP FRONT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE NOT ONLY THEIR INTENTIONS BUT THEIR ACTIONS ARE. BECAUSE IT THINK THERE IS A LOT OF SUSPICION THAT'S OUT THERE AND WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD IN A POSITION OF TRUST. SO I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS HEARING WOULD NOW ALLOW D. W. R. TO MOVE FORWARD. IN A WAY THAT -- MAY NOT. NECESSARILY HAVE SUPPORT OF PEOPLE IN IN THE DELTA COMMUNITY AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT -- WE'LL HEAR REASSURANCES FROM THE W. ART THAT'S NOT THE CASE -- THAT -- THINGS WILL NOT BE HAPPENING THE BACKGROUND AND SO I LOOK FOR TO TO TO THAT. TESTIMONY AS WELL I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A CORE OF THE COMMITTEE PRESENTS HERE AT THE MOMENT -- BUT CERTAINLY -- LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING PRESENTATIONS THAT WE HAVE. BEFORE US THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DOCTOR PAN AND AGAIN TO CLARIFY -- NO ROLE IS TAKEN NO PHOTOS TAKEN IN THERE'S NO QUORUM REQUIREMENT FOR AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING CENTER MINING. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TOO WANT. TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO IN THANKING YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND FOR FACILITATING -- BROAD PARTICIPATION FROM OUR SENATE COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING. FROM BOTH THE PLANS PRESENTERS AND STAKE HOLDERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY. I SHARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS VOICED BY MY COLLEAGUE THAT I WILL WAIT AND GET THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE CHAIR TO ASK QUESTIONS AS THE APPROPRIATE WITNESSES COME FORWARD SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR REMINDING SENATOR FOWLER. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR I THINK THIS IS -- VERY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US TO GET THE QUESTIONS OUT ON THE TABLE TO MAKE. THE DISTINCTIONS THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO DO OUR DAILY BUSINESS -- IN THE WATER PROJECT WHICH IS CRITICALLY NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE OTHER NEW PROJECTS UP ALONG THE WAY. AND THAT THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY INTER DEPENDENT UPON THIS HEARING BUT THAT IT IS A PART OF THE OVERALL BUSINESS OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AND THE DVR AND ALL OF THE WATER STAKE HOLDERS THAT ARE HERE SO. THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THAT. AND ASK OUR QUESTIONS IN A TIME WHERE WE HAVE A LITTLE LESS DISTRACTION AND WE HAD HIM SECTIONS OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE WE HAVE L. A. L. COME UP I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT -- OF REALLY AMONG HUNDREDS OF LETTERS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED BUT LETTERS FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE -- FROM THE DELTA CAUCUS THANK YOU AS WELL AS FROM A SITTING MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND I'M JUST GOING TO READ IT EXCEPT IF YOU DON'T MIND SIR BECAUSE I WANT -- THE WITNESS FIRST FROM -- THE DID IF YOU ARE TO BE PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. THE POINT OF THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING. IS FOR US TO GET INFORMATION. AND THAT IS WHAT I FULLY INTEND TO HAVE HAPPENED TODAY. AS A PART OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL OVER SEX THIS LECTURE AND SO FROM -- THE LETTER FROM THE DELTA CAUCUS -- SIGNED BY MEMBERS OF BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. ON IT SAYS AND I QUOTE AT PRESENT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE POORLY DEFINED AND EXPLAINED THAT HAVE POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS FAR BEYOND THEIR PARENTS GO. THERE IS MUCH THAT REMAINS UNKNOWN REGARDING THE EXTENSIVE CHANGES TO THE SWP CONTRACTS ARE BEING PROPOSED AND HOW THE CHANGES WILL IMPACT PROPERTY TAXES WATER RATES THE FISCAL INTEGRITY OF THE SWP. AND GENERAL FUN. NEITHER THE PROPOSALS AS TO BE CONTRACT EXTENSION AMENDMENTS NOR THE WATER FIX CONTRA COMMITMENTS HAVE FULLY COMPLETED THE CALIFORNIA. IN ITS SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS THE LACK OF ANALYSIS AND TRANSPARENCY OF THESE AMENDMENTS CREATES A FAULT OF COMPLEXITY FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE LEGISLATURE TO CONDUCT APPROPRIATE. LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. EQUALLY IMPORTANT THE DVR'S CURRENTLY NEGOTIATED THIS ALL MEMBERS OF THE SWP CONTRACTS REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX PROJECT THOSE AMENDMENTS WOULD ALLOW PERMANENT TRANSFERS OF WATER BETWEEN SWP CONTRACTORS. IN ORDER TO ALLOW URBAN SBP CONTRACTORS SUCH AS THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO PERMANENTLY PURCHASE WATER FROM AGRICULTURE AND CITY CONTRACTS SUCH AS THE KERN COUNTY WATER MORE OF THE COST. FOR THE WATER FIX PROJECT I'M GONNA GO DEEPER INTO THE WATER FIX PEACE BUT I WANTED TO FOCUS ON THAT. LINE OF QUESTIONING AND THAT. CLEAR CONCERN WITH REGARD TO THE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS THAT AT THE POINT OF TODAY'S HEARING. AGAIN WE RECEIVED A SIGNED LETTER FROM FOUR SITTING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND WE HAVE -- WITNESSES HERE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY DURING PUBLIC COMMENT -- AGAIN THEY'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXORBITANT COST OF THE PROJECT AND THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS SO I THINK BOTH LETTERS GENERALLY -- REFLECT COMMON SENT THIS WILL BE ABLE -- TO DEALT A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY BUT I WANTED TO AT THE ONSET OF TODAY'S HEARING. IDENTIFY THOSE CONCERNS AND LET THE DEPARTMENT NO WE ARE FULLY EXPECTING TO ENGAGE IN A HEARTY DISCUSSION ALL AND AND EXPECT TO GLEAN ANSWERS TO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. SO IT WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH THE HEARING I'LL INVITE -- DELI ELSE OFFICE TO STEP FORWARD RACHEL ELLERS. GOOD MORNING EVERYTHING YOU MAN I'M GOING TO ASK THAT AFTER YOU FINISH THE TESTIMONY THAT YOU STAY AT THE TABLE SO AS WE GO INTO QUESTIONS WHATTHE DEPARTMENT COMES FORWARD TO BE. READY AND AVAILABLE LOOSELY THANK YOU THANK YOU GOOD MORNING RACHEL EHLERS WITH THE LEGEND LESS OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT'S BEING DISTRIBUTED RIGHT NOW THE HAND IT'S ALSO ON OUR WEBSITE FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT ON THE DANCE. I'VE BEEN ASKED BY SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY THE STATE WATER PROJECT ITSELF AND ITS CONTRACTING PROCESS TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR THE DISCUSSION. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CONTRACT AMENDMENT TO BE DISCUSSING TODAY ALTHOUGH CLEARLY DID DETAILED DISCUSSION AND PRESENTATION WILL BE FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON THAT. AND THEN CONCLUDE WITH SAM SUGGESTED OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS FOR YOU AS YOU PROCEED THROUGH THE HEARING. SO TURNING TO THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT AS AS THE CHAIR NOTED THIS IS A SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL ROLE FOR THE JAIL BC BUT IT IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. THAT ANY RENEWAL OR EXTENSION. OF A LONG TERM WATER SUPPLY CONTRACT BETWEEN D. W. ARE AND THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTOR HAVE THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE IN THE CONTRACTORS' CANNOT PROCEED TO FINALIZE THOSE AMENDMENTS UNTIL SIXTY DAYS AFTER THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TAKES PLACE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN APPLICABLE SINCE THAT STATUTE WAS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SO. HAVE. UNUSUAL SITUATION. AND HERE WE ARE -- THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR THAT DATE OF YOUR PRESENTATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CONTRACT AND AND HOW THOSE -- DIDN'T SERVE S A TEMPLATE FOR THE REMAINING LONG TERM WATER SUPPLY CONTRACTS. AND AS THE CHAIR NOTED THE STATUTE DOES NOT REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM THE JAIL B. C. OR ANY FORMAL ACTION JUST THAT THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TAKE PLACE. SO TURNING TO PAGE TWO TO SOME BACKGROUND ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT ITSELF -- IN SIMPLEST TERMS IT'S A STATE OWNED. WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT BRINGS WATER FROM NORTH TO SOUTH -- IT'S IT'S QUITE LARGE -- ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE NATION IT HAS THE TALLEST DAM IN THE NATION IN ORVILLE AND THE HIGHEST WATER LEFT IN THE WORLD TO BRING THE WATER OVER THE TO HATCH BE MOUNTAINS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT'S A SYSTEM OF RESERVOIRS AQUEDUCTS POWER PLANTS AND PUMPING PLANTS THAT AS THE CHAIR NOTED EXTENDS MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED MILES. AND IT APSOS WATER TO THESE TWENTY NINE LONG TERM WATER CONTRACTORS SOME OF THESE CONTRACTORS -- USE THE WATER DIRECTLY THEIR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT THAT BRINGS THE WATER DIRECTLY TO RESIDENTS AND SOME OF THOSE CONTRACTORS ARE WATER WHOLESALERS THAT RECEIVE THE% WATER AND THEN IN TURN SELL IT. TO CITIES AND COUNTIES ONE OF THE LARGEST WATER WHOLESALERS AS METROPOLITAN WARM WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM -- LATER TODAY. MOST AS FOR RESIDENCES AND BUSINESSES FROM ABOUT 30% IS USED FOR AGRICULTURE SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A SWITCH FROM THAT OTHER BIG WATER SYSTEM THE STATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT ON BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT PRIMARILY SERVES AGRICULTURAL -- CUSTOMERS THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL. HOW MUCH WATER IS DELIVERED EVERY YEAR REALLY VARIES VARIES -- IN PART BASED ON HOW MUCH WATER WE RECEIVE AS A STATE -- IN RAIN AND SNOW FALL IN A GIVEN YEAR BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE SALINITY IN THE DELTA WATER NEEDED FOR MIGRATING FINISH THEIR STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT GOVERN HOW MUCH WATER CAN BE PUMPED IN THE SET THROUGH THE PUMPS IN THE SOUTH OF THE DELTA. I'M DOWN TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE LONG TERM AVERAGE. ACROSS THE PAST TEN YEARS IS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRE FEET HAS BEEN DELIVERED. THROUGH THE STATE WATER PROJECT -- THIS IS MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT THE DATA WOULD YOU W. R. DOCUMENT STATE CAN BE THE FULL OPERATING. KAT CAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM IN PART BECAUSE OF THOSE LIMITING FACTORS THAT I MENTIONED ALTHOUGH THAT THIS THE PROJECT IS NEVER DELIVERED THE FULL AMOUNT OF WHAT IS STATED AS ITS OPERATING CAPACITY -- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE SYSTEM DELIVERED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET SO HIGHER THAN THE LONG TERM AVERAGE SINCE WE HAD A RELATIVELY WENT YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN AS AS WE ALL KNOW THAT MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED A MAJOR MODIFICATION TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN THE DELTA. KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA WATER FIX AND THAT PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF SEEKING REGULATORY AND PERMISSIONS AND FUNDING COMMITMENTS. TURN TO PAGE. THREE HIS SYSTEM MAP OF THE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE OF FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE VISUAL LEARNERS -- MAKE OR A BILL AT THE TOP OF THE FEATHER RIVER IS THE LARGEST RESERVOIR IN THE SYSTEM. AND YOU CAN SEE THE DELTA IS THE SPIDER WEB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAP AND THEN THE STARK LINES ARE THE THE MAIN AQUEDUCT CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT THAT BRINGS THE WATER TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS JUST SHOWS THE STATE OWNED FACILITIES THERE ARE MANY LOCAL AND AND ALSO FEDERALLY OWNED -- FACILITIES THAT BRING THAT WATER TO THE LAST TWELVE CITIES THAT YOU SAID WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY THESE LONG TERM CONTRACTS SIX SIXTY ARMS TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY EIGHTY FIVE ONE OF THE MAJOR CHANGES IS ABOUT THE BILLING AND FOR CAPITAL COSTS CHANGING FROM THE CURRENT CONTRACTS OF WHERE -- COSTS MUST BE AMORTIZED OVER MANY YEARS TO PAY AS YOU GO SYSTEM -- THERE'S A PROVISION TO INCREASE THE INCREASE THE ALLOWABLE RESERVE -- AMOUNT FOR THE PROJECT -- IT EXTENDS EXPANDS THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DATE OF YOUR CAN ISSUE WATER SYSTEM FACILITY REVENUE BONDS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS SO WHEN THE CURRENT CONTRACT IT'S LIMITED -- TO FACILITIES IN ORDERTO TO ISSUE THESE BONDS IS LIMITED TO FACILITIES THAT WERE IN PLACE BEFORE. NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SO THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR ISSUING THESE TYPES OF BONDS FOR NEW FACILITIES -- IT ESTABLISHES A NEW FINANCE COMMITTEE FOR D. W. R. AND CONTRACTORS TO DISCUSS WITH EACH OTHER -- FINANCIAL PROVISIONS OF THE PROJECT AND THEN FINALLY THE LAST BULLET. SOMETHING THAT THE CHAIR NOTED IT DOES NOT INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO CALIFORNIA WATER FIX BUT I JUST SPEND A MA'AM MOMENT ADDRESSING THAT. WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS IT DOESN'T INCLUDE PROVISIONS RELATED TO HOW WATER FIX COSTS WOULD BE ALLOCATED ACROSS THE CONTRACTORS ARE HOW ANY WATER THAT WOULD COME AS A RESULT OF THE WATER FIX PROJECT WOULD BE ALLOCATED? THAT IS BEING NEGOTIATED IN A SEPARATE CONTRACT AMENDMENT RIGHT NOW THAT IS NOT PART OF WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY. BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW SOME OF THESE TERMS CLEARLY WOULD AFFECT AND FACILITATE A WATER FIX PROJECT IF IT WERE TO GO FORWARD. FOR EXAMPLE -- THE ABILITY. TO ISSUE NEW WATER SYSTEM FACILITY REVENUE BONDS FOR A NEW FACILITY CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE ESSENTIAL IF A WATER FIX PROJECT WERE TO GO FORWARD -- EXTENDING THE CONTRACT TERMS TO FINANCE AIMING A PROJECT FINANCING OF A PROJECT CLEARLY WOULD BE ESSENTIAL. SO I THINK ONE WAY THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS -- SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THESE AMENDMENTS BEFORE YOU. WOULD WOULD FACILITATE AND PROBABLY BE NECESSARY FOR WATER FIX PROJECT TO GO FORWARD. BUT THESE PROVISIONS WOULD ALSO FACILITATE AND BE NECESSARY FOR THE EXISTING OPERATIONS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHETHER OR NOT WATER FIX GOES FORWARD. SEVEN FINALLY TURNING TO PAGE SIX THESE ARE JUST SOME OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS WE WANTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND PROCEEDING WITH THE HEARING TODAY -- WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY PROBLEMS THESE CONTRACTS ARE AMENDMENTS ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS AND DO YOU FEEL THAT THEY ADDRESS THEM? ARE THERE OTHER PROBLEMS OR ISSUES THAT AREN'T ADDRESSED BY THESE CONTACT AMENDMENTS AND WHY NOT AND HOW WILL THOSE BE ADDRESSED -- WAS THERE ADEQUATE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AND INPUT IN DEVELOPING THESE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS. HOW WILL THESE AFFECT THE RATE PAYERS WHO ULTIMATELY WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR ANY CHANGES AND BRAND EXISTING OPERATIONS? AND NOT ONLY HOW MUCH THEY PAID BUT WHAT THEY PAY FOR THE WATER THEY RECEIVE WILL THESE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT -- THE ULTIMATE END USERS WILL RECEIVE. WHAT'S THE STATUS OF OTHER CONTRACT AMENDMENTS IN PARTICULAR THOSE AMENDMENTS RELATED TO WATER FIX WHY WERE THOSE NOT INCORPORATED HERE AND AND MOVING INTO THE LAST PIECE WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT. NOT ONLY ON CONTRACT CHANGES BUT OVER ALL OVER THE STATE WATER PROJECT OPERATIONS AND DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES AND IF NOT HOW MY TO PURSUE INCREASING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. SO WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS NOW AND CERTAINLY WILL STAY OF OTHER QUESTIONS ARISE LATER. VERY MUCH QUESTIONS OF COMMITTEE. TALK TO PAM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WHILE I'M GOING TO SUGGEST JUMP DOWN TO EAT YOU HAVE HIS RECOMMENDATION. AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ONE THINGS IS -- ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEGISLATIVE -- WHAT BE TOLD AS WE HAVE THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING THEY HAVE THESE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS WE DON'T EVEN VOTE ON THEM? THEY'RE OFF TO THE RACES IN ALL THIS SIXTY DAYS. SO. WHAT? WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE L. A. L. AS TERMS OF OUR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT -- THESE -- CONTINUES IT PROPRIA WE HAVE -- YOU MADE MENTION THAT ONE OF THE THANK YOU KNOW WHEN THE ITEM THIS IS ACTUALLY -- BUT NOT NOT ONLY OF COURSE THE TIME PERIOD BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO JUST SEARCH THE FORM YOU CONTRACTS FRIGHTENED AND PUT NEW BONDS RIGHT FOR FOR THINGS. AND THOSE ARE CONTINUES THE APPROPRIATE SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN TERMS OF FROM THE L. AS PERSPECTIVE AS TO HOW WE CAN EXERCISE. ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OVER THESE ACTIONS OR IS IT D. W. R. TO CONTRACTORS OFF DOING THEIR OWN THING AND WE JUST SIR WATCH ON THE SIDELINES. YEAH AND OUR OFFICE HAS HISTORICALLY IN THE PAST RECOMMENDED -- EXPLORING BRINGING THIS ON TO BUDGET JUST FOR INCREASED LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IT'S IT'S QUITE A LOT OF MONEY AND AND QUITE A SIGNIFICANT -- STATE. INVESTMENT AND CONCERN -- FROM. CANCER NOT AS A IMPLYING THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS BUT JUST AS AN ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND STATE -- SHOULD SHOULD BE EVER SINGS ABOUT SOMETHING OUR OFFICE HAS HAS RECOMMENDED IN THE PAST JUST FOR GREATER UPSET THAT COMES THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. YOU DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NOW TO APPROVE POSITIONS BUT THAT'S REALLY THE THE NEXUS WITH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT -- THE FUNDING AGAIN IS CONTINUOUSLY PURPOSE SO THAT WOULD BE ONE THING YOU COULD EXPLORE. AND DO WE HAVE ANY I MEAN. TONE ONE LEVEL DOWN THERE FLOATING BONDS OVER IT TO HAVE ANY FINANCIAL LIABILITY FOR ANY OF THESE THINGS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS. ONE STOPS AYING RIGHT WE HAVE THIS HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE SOMEONE STOPS PAYING THE BOND IS IS THERE SOME POINT WITH THE STATE OBLIGATED TO STEP IN AND RESCUE. OF CONTRACTORS OR IS GOD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENS I MEAN WHAT'S OUR LIABILITY IS A STATE. EVEN THOUGH TECHNICALLY THE CONTRACTORS PAYING FOR THAT SET HER UP BUT DO WE HAVE FISCAL LIABILITY -- FOR ANY OF THIS IS SOMETHING BLOWS UP QUESTION I THINK IT'S ONE I I'M THAT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO ASK THE DB ARE LAWYERS WHO ARE HERE IN THE ROOM AND HOPEFULLY COMING UP I'M. YOU KNOW I THINK THE WAY IT HAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO US IS THAT THE CONTRACTS ARE WRITTEN SUCH THAT IF ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS DEFAULTS THAN THOSE COSTS TO FREE THEM WOULD SHIFT TO THE OTHER CONTRACTORS THAT THAT THEY ARE -- KIND OF THE PROJECT ITSELF MUST COVER IT BUT AGAIN AS WE SAW WITH ORVILLE THIS YEAR IT'S THERE'S SOME SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES THERE SO -- YEAH I ATE AT NOT BEING THE WAY I DON'T WANT TO ADDRESS THAT BUT I I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION WHAT APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE WELL CERTAINLY HOPE IT NEVER HAPPENS -- WHEN THE FISCAL COLLAPSE HAPPEN IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD THIS WHOLE INTERLOCKING WEB RATE BECAUSE THEY'RE ONES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY INSURING EACH OTHER IT CETERA SO? WHAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW IT'S A DOMINO WHAT HAPPENS IS ONE CONTRACTOR THAT LEADS TO ANOTHER CONTRACT AT LEAST ANOTHER CAT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL THE WATER BUSINESS RIGHT SOMETHING HAPPENS -- THE AND THEN THIS IS A STATE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY. IS THE STATE HAVING THIS IS THE STATE GOING TO HAVE TO STEP IN. I THINK I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND SAY OBVIOUSLY HAS A BIG INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT ITS RESIDENTS HAVE WATER IS RIGHT. OKAY SO THAT THAT WOULD BE. BEDFORD RATIONALE FOR US BEING EXERCISING MORE OVERSIGHT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED A RATIONALE -- QUITE FRANKLY SENATOR PAN BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD EVER DIMINISH OR UNDER ESTIMATE. THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AROUND. LEGISLATIVE AND BUDGETARY OVERSIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF LA L.. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRASIER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTRACT AMENDMENT WAS A ANY OTHER CASH BENEFIT ANALYSIS DONE THAT ACTUALLY PROVE THAT IT NEEDED TO BE AMENDED I MEAN WE'RE LOOKING AT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE VARIOUS DATES CENTER DATE PLEASE CONTRACTS AND WHY. NOW -- YEAH I THINK I'M I'M SURE THE THE SUBSEQUENT PANELISTS WILL ADDRESS THAT I THINK ONE OF THE BIG RATIONALES IS -- THAT. THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTORS OFTEN TAKE OUT BONDS IN ORDER TO FINANCE SOME OF THE COSTS OF THE REPAIRS ST I'M GOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND THE SHORTER TERM -- ON YOUR CONTRACT THE HARDER IT IS TO GO GET FINANCING FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND HIGHER INTEREST COSTS THAT THOUGH THAT THE REPAIRS ULTIMATELY HAVE TO PACE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE STRONGEST RATIONALES THAT WE'VE THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US BUT AGAIN I THINK YOU'LL HEAR SOME. ABOUT FROM THE CONTRACTORS AND SUB CMPANIONS. THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT SONS IN SOME INSTANCES ENVIRONMENTAL. PROTECTIONS.% ARE SUSPECT IN AND PUT IT PUT IT -- TO RISK BECAUSE OF A DEBT SERVICE MAYBE -- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE THE FISSION POSSIBLY. IT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE -- THAT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW AND YOU KNOW SO IT'S LIKE A WE DEFINITELY JUST ON A DEED OF YOURS -- MERCY IS A AS A LEGISLATURE TO THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND THE BEST -- YOU KNOW INTEREST OF PROTECTING US -- HAVING OUR BACKS SO THAT WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG. YOU DON'T. ULTIMATELY THERE TO LOOK AT US. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO USE. A HIGH SPEED RAIL AS A AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUBLIC WAS TOLD ONE THING. NOW IT'S COSTING ANOTHER. AND WHO'S GOING TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THAT. IF IT DOES GO IN PEOPLE A KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAY THAT DEBT SERVICING THE PAPER OUT IN HIS HEAD. CENTER PANDAS OPENLY STATED. WE'RE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG. WE HAVEN'T DONE MEGAPROJECTS WELL YET. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE GO FORWARD. WITH NOT TO EXCEED THE COSTS. AS A FORMER CONTRACTOR. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE RATE PAYERS. GET A VALUE FOR THEIR DOLLAR AND NOT IF HE COMES INTO A DROUGHT YEAR. THAT DOES SERVICE DOESN'T STOP AND IF THEY'RE NOT TRANSFERRING WATER. OKAY WATER PRICES GO UP TO PAY FOR THAT DEBT SERVICE AND SOYOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN A VICIOUS CYCLE AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT ALL OF THOSE ASPECTS WHEN THEY LOOK AT LONG TERM EFFECTS THROUGH VARMINT THE ECONOMY -- AND THE SUBSEQUENT POSSIBILITY THAT -- SOMEBODY WAS OUT -- SO IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT YOU ASKING ABOUT THE WATER FIX PROJECT IN PARTICULAR OR I'M A CLEVELAND. GENERAL IS THAT I'M GONNA JUST CALL IT IS A OVERALL THE GENERAL CONSENSUS BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW NOT OLD TWENTY NINE CONTRACTS. WOULD BE AFFECTED. BUT I THINK IT'S FEATURED THE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WE'RE SAYING. DOES THIS EQUATE. TO UP BY NECESSITY RIGHT NOW WHERE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD. WE AND I MEAN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO GO IN BONN WITHOUT. PERMISSION OF THIS LEGISLATURE. WE GIVE US AGENCIES LESS OF FORTY SALUCES WHO SEEMS LIKE IT'S A KIND OF UNPRECEDENTED. YEAH I AM I WILL DEFER SOME IN TO THE ACTUAL CONTRACT JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT THE FINANCIAL BURDEN IS ON THEM ON IN TERMS OF THE FINANCING I MEAN I IT'S IT IS. CLEARLY STILL YEARS AWAY THE EXPIRATION I DO THINK THEY ARE THEY THEY START TO GET SQUEEZED DOES ACTION DOES ACTION NEED TO HAPPEN TODAY -- TO AVOID THAT SQUEEZE WITH ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO WHAT THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS WOULD BE YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THEM TO MAKE THAT CASE -- I THINK CLEARLY AS I STATED EARLIER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WATER FIX GOES THROUGH OR NOT FROM AN OPERATIONS PERSPECTIVE OF THE EXISTING PROJECT AT SOME POINT. THESE -- EXISTING CONSTRAINTS WILL START TO BE PROBLEMS AND WHEN WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. SENATOR PAN YOU HAVE THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER JOHNNY YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR SAYING THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS NOT -- TO CAST ANY TYPE OF BOAT OR ANY APPROVAL OF THE WATER FIX BUT RATHER TO LOOK AT THAT CONTRACT EXTENSION AND I TINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THAT ON THE RECORD -- SO I THINK THE CHAIR FOR THAT -- pWE'RE REALLY -- LOOKING TO YOU FOR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE CAN HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT OVER THIS PROJECT -- I DON'T MY QUESTION TO YOU WILL BE WHETHER THERE ARE ANY OTHER SIMILAR STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS IS PAYING AND THAT. PAYS YOU GO AND THE BENEFICIARY PAYS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH WE LOOK AT EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS USED TO HAVING -- OVERSIGHT OVER ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS -- HIGH SPEED RAIL A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER USED BY AUTHOR THAT AND AND AND NOT PROJECT WE HAD A BUSINESS PLAN THAT MUST COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. EVERY TWO YEARS BEFORE THERE IS ANY FINDING THAT'S EVER REQUESTED TOWARD THE PROJECT. THEY HAVE TO HAVE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL AND IT HAS TO BE IN THE BUDGET AND THEN THERE'S A PRE. EXPENDITURE PROCESS WHERE APPROPRIATED AUTHORITY MUST COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE FINAL PLAN BEFORE THEY EVER CUT A CHECK. AND WITH THIS PROJECT WE HAVE THIS HEARING THAT'S IN PLACE AND THEN THERE WILL BE NEGOTIATIONS THAT TAKE PLACE WITH D. W. A. R. AND THE AND THE CONTRACTORS BUT LARGELY WE ARE LEFT OUT OF THIS PROCESS. AND WE JUST AS A LEGISLATURE WENT THROUGH THE THE CHANGES WITH REGARD TO P. JEANNIE AND OUR ENERGY PROVIDERS BECAUSE OF THE WILD FIRES THAT OCCURRED. AND IT IS IN THIS IS A SIMILAR THING WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE'S WATER GRID SIMILAR TO THE ENERGY GRID AND EVERYBODY HAS AN INTEREST IN IT. ANNA SENATOR PAM POINTED OUT OF SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG -- WE ARE WE ARE GOING TO BE ACCOUNTABLE AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BAIL OUT WHOMEVER TO MAKE SURE THAT WATER CAN STILL BE DELIVERED AS IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE WE CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT OBVIOUSLY. SO I THINK WE ARE ALL LOOKING TO YOU. TO MAKES SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHAT MORE WE SHOULD BE DOING AND WHAT ARE SOME OTHER SIMILAR PROJECTS AND AND WHAT THAT OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU CENTER AND THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE AS YOUR AS YOUR ADVISORS ON THAT I THINK -- ON THE RECORD WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS IS BRINGING THE ON BUDGET WHICH I THINK WOULD WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND AND YOU'RE OVER SEVERAL QUITE A BIT BUT SPECIFICALLY RELATED. TO NINE AM. OTHER STATE WATER PROJECT -- PROJECTS WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND I THINK ONE IMPORTANT POINT. TO YOUR POINT ABOUT -- MADE HAPPENING OFF BOOKS AND BETWEEN TWO TO BR IT'S IT'S NOT THE RIVATE SECTOR IT'S ME IT'S PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES AND AND PUBLIC RATE PAYERS CALIFORNIANS ARE PAYING SO MUCH ENERGY GREAT IN THAT WAY SO. YOU ELEVATES THE IMPORTANCE OF OF STATE OVERSIGHT EVEN MORE. YEAH I THINK TO THAT POINT YOU KNOW WE DID HAVE A COLLEAGUE OF SUPERMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM WHO. INTRODUCED THE BILL VERY LATE IN THE PROCESS BEFORE WE ADJOURN THAT BE ATTEMPTED TO BEGIN TO STIPULATE WAYS IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE. SHALL BE INVOLVED -- L. A. L. -- THROUGH THE COURSE OF INTERIM -- TO TO HAVE YOU -- PROVIDE US WITH -- MORE OPTIONS AS REQUESTED BY CENTER COUNTY RD BACK TO A DOCTOR PAN. TO JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION -- BECAUSE I'D MAKE NOTE THAT THE LAW SAYS WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS HEARING AND THEN SIXTY DAYS OF THE LEAST. THEY CAN FINALIZE SO AND WE'VE HAD SOME LETTERS FROM PEOPLE INDICATING THAT THE MEN MEN SIR NOT YOU'LL STILL VEGAS CENTERS SO THAT I SOON YOU'VE LOOKED AT THE M. A. CONTRACTS AMENDMENTS AND SO FORTH. IS YOUR VIEW THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS RIGHT NOW ARE ESSENTIALLY THAT THE FINAL FORM OR DAYS STILL US LOTS OF STUFF STILL NEGOTIATE. FROM THIS FROM TODAY IN WHICH WE'RE HAVING HERE AND ALERTS AND WILSON LAST YEAR WE ARE WHEN THEY COME UP HERE BUT IS THE VERSION SO YOU A DIVERSIONS YOU REVIEWED ARE THOSE ESSENTIALLY THE FIRE. PRETTY MUCH THE FINAL VERSIONS THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO US I BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING FOR TWO YEARS AND HAD MULTIPLE PUBLIC OKAY BUT THE FINAL VERSIONS ARE WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING MY UNDERSTANDING AGAIN I I WOULD DEFER TO THEM THAT'S ME OKAY. ALL RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU AND JUST TO CLARIFY ITS FIVE YEARS TO TWENTY THIRTEEN THEY BEEN INVOLVED IN. THE PROCESS. ANY ONE ELSE. OKAY THANK YOU WILL HAVE YOU SET THE TABLE -- DIRECTING THEM. AND I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME OTHER COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT FEEL FREE -- TO BRING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS CARLA NEMETH I AM THE DIRECTOR OF TE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND JOINING ME HERE TODAY IS JOEL LEDESMA HE'S THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AND STEVE COLL IN OUR DEPARTMENT ATTORNEY WHO PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES RELATED TO THE CONTRACT EXTENSION AMENDMENT. WE ARE HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU THE PROPOSED CONTRACT AMENDMENT THAT WOULD EXTEND THE STATE'S TWENTY NINE WATER CONTRACTS BEYOND THEIR EXISTING TERMS. UNDER EXISTING AGREEMENTS THE TERMS OF THESE VITAL WATER CONTRACTS BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU TODAY WOULD EXTEND THESE. TWENTY EIGHTY FIVE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S GAVE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND I WANT TO BRIEFLY ADD THAT THE STATE WATER PROJECT EXTENDS FROM PLUMAS COUNTY IN THE NORTH TO RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN THE SOUTH. IT SERVES THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY THE NORTH AND SOUTH BAY AREA THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE CENTRAL COAST AND SIGNIFICANT REACHES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE INLAND EMPIRE. IT'S DAMS RESERVOIRS PUMPING PLANTS HYDROELECTRIC FACILITIES AND HUNDREDS OF MILES OF AQUEDUCT. PROVIDE NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE THAT'S TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION WITH SOME PIECE OF THEIR WATER SUPPLY. THE CONTINUED SUPPLY OF WATER FROM THE STATE WATER PROJECT WILL REMAIN AS VITAL FOR THE NEXT SIXTY YEARS AS IT HAS FOR THE LAST SIXTY YEARS. AND THIS AMENDMENT WILL ENSURE THE FINANCIAL STABILITY NEEDED TO DO THIS. FOR THE AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH BLANKS IN THE EXISTING TERM OF THE WATER SUPPLY CONTRACTS BY FIFTY YEARS. THESE WERE FIRST ENTERED INTO IN THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN SIXTY AND BEGAN EXPIRING IN. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE YOU MAY ASK WHY THIS AMENDMENT IS NEEDED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE TERM DOESN'T EXPIRE UNTIL. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES THE CAPITAL COSTS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT HAVE BEEN FINANCED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF REVENUE BONDS. TODAY WITH THE FIRST CONTRACTS EXPIRING IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE DEPARTMENT IS LIMITED TO SELLING BONDS WITH MATURITY DATES THAT EXTEND ONLY TO THAT DATE. AS A RESULT BONDS SOLD THIS YEAR WOULD HAVE MATURITY DATES THAT EXTENDED ONLY SEVENTEEN YEARS. AND BONDS TO BE SOLD WILL HAVE THE MATURITY -- BONDS TO BE SOLD NEXT WE'LL HAVE MATURITY DATES THAT EXTENT ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS RATHER THAN THE THIRTY YEARS AS IS CUSTOMARY FOR SUCH REVENUE BONDS. THIS SHORTER REPAYMENT PERIOD INCREASES OUR ANNUAL REPAYMENT COSTS THAT WE EXTEND TO THE CONTRACTORS AND RATEPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE US -- HAS THE ULTIMATE POTENTIAL OF IN. OF HOW WE ACTUALLY RUN THE EXISTING STATE WATER PROJECT. OUR FACILITIES ARE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY YEARS OLD AND MANY ARE IN NEED OF CAPITAL UPGRADES AND REPAIRS. ANNUALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES UNDERTAKES CAPITAL PROJECTS TO DO JUST THAT. SOME EXAMPLES ARE THE RECENT SEISMIC REINFORCING OF PARIS DAMN. THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE FAMILY -- POWER PLANT IN THE AFTERMATH OF A DAMAGING FIRE. AND THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SPILL WAY SAID ORVILLE DAMN. THESE REALLY JUST SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF THE REPAIRS AND REFURBISHMENTS AND REPLACEMENT THAT WE ANTICIPATE -- NECESSARY ON FOUR HUNDRED PLUS MILES OF THE AQUEDUCT THREE HUNDRED MILES OF PIPELINES INTO THE THIRTY TWO PUMPING AND HYDROELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS. LIDDY TO EFFECTIVELY AND AFFORDABLY FINANCE THESE PROJECTS THROUGH THIRTY YEAR BONDS IS VITAL TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT. THE PUBLIC WATERAGENCIES AND THEIR RATE PAYERS. IN ADDITION TO EXTENDING THE CONTRACTS THE AMENDMENT WOULD ELIMINATE THE NO LONGER NEEDED. AMORTIZATION SCHEDULES OF REPAYMENT AND INSTEAD IT WOULD SHIP THIS AMORTIZATION TO A PAY AS YOU GO SYSTEM. AND THIS EFFECTIVELY BETTER MATCHES REVENUES WITH EXPENDITURES. IT ALSO INCREASES ARE OPERATING OF RESERVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT FROM THIRTY MILLION. TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AN AMOUNT WHICH BETTER REFLECTS THE REALITY OF OPERATING A WATER UTILITY OF THIS SIZE. AND IT WAS DERIVED FROM AN ASSESSMENT OF SOME SHE WAITED UTILITIES AND AN ESTIMATE OF FUTURE OPERATING EXPENSES. IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A FINANCE COMMITTEE TO RECOMMEND FINANCIAL POLICIES SUCH AS APPROPRIATE DEMINT DEBT LIMITS AND CRITERIA FOR PROJECTS TO BE FINANCED OR PAID FOR IN THE YEAR OF THE INCURRED COST. AND FINALLY -- THE AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU ESTABLISHES A REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT. THIS WOULD FUND SOME OF THE CAPITAL PROJECTS IN LIEU OF ISSUING ADDITIONAL REVENUE BONDS AND A SUPPORT ACCOUNT THAT WOULD FUN ACTIONS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE CHARGEABLE TO THE WATER CONTRACTORS AS WATER SUPPLY CHARGES. I DO WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE THE THEME OF THE INTER RELATEDNESS OF THE CONTRACT EXTENSION TO THE WATER FIX PROJECT. AND THE AMENDMENT THAT IS THE CONTRACT AMENDMENT THAT IS UNDER WAY IT RELATED TO THAT PROJECT. I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT IT AND IT'S IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY IS ESSENTIALLY -- IT'S CRITICAL TO THE FINANCIAL UNDERPINNING OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND OUR ABILITY TO RUN THE LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ASSETS WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE GROUNDS THAT ARE MOVING WATER ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. WATER FIX AS I MENTIONED HAS ITS OWN SEPARATE CONTRACT AMENDMENT PROCESS THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE'VE HANDLED OTHER PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT. RECENTLY THAT SUPPORT THE STATE WATER PROJECT THAT INCLUDES THE SOUTH BAY AQUEDUCT IT INCLUDES THE EAST BRANCH OF THE AQUEDUCT DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IT INCLUDES -- PORTIONS OF THE COASTAL AQUEDUCT THAT SERVE THE COAST A PORTION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- CENTRAL CALIFORNIA RATHER. SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON THAT THE DEPARTMENT PURSUES A SEPARATE CONTRACT AMENDMENT WHEREBY WE ESTABLISH HOW COST FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT WOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG ITS CONTRACTORS AND CHARGED. THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF AND AS FOLKS HAVE MENTIONED -- THAT IS -- IS INTERRELATED BUT VERY MUCH SEPARATE FROM THE NEED FOR THE CONTRACT EXTENSION IN THE MET AMENDMENT THAT WE PRESENT BEFORE YOU TODAY -- I'D BE DELIGHTED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THE AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU TODAY AND AND OUR PROCESS ON THE WATER FIX AMENDMENT AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DIRECTOR I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES BUT I WANT TO START BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A FOLLOW UP -- TO FAR LAST OPPORTUNITY -- TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS -- AT THE JULY THIRD HEARING AT THAT HEARING I ASKED ABOUT THE IMPACT. OF THE WATER FIX PROJECT TO RATE PAYERS AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM YOUR FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT. RESPONDED THAT QUOTE A REVISED ESTIMATE WAS IN THE WORKS IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAPPEN BY THE END OF THE SUMMER I PUSHED HARD TO GET A SENSE OF TIMING. I THINK I OFFERED THE SEASON'S OPTION AND I WAS TOLD BY THE END OF SUMMER -- WE ARE NOW. IN THE SECOND WEEK OF SEPTEMBER AN ODD. TO MY KNOWLEDGE -- SUCH REPORT HAS NOT BEEN SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY. AND WHEN WE CAN EXPECT IT. YOU CAN EXPECT US SENATOR MITCHELL AND THAT WAS ME WHO PROVIDED THAT RESPONSE AND YOU CAN EXPECT THAT NEXT WEEK EXCELLENT THANK YOU WITH THAT I'LL OPEN UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS I HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO FOR YOU THE OPPORTUNITY. FIRST. DON'T EVERYONE JUMP AT ONCE I WILL GO AHEAD SENATOR FULLER FOLLOWED BY MINING AND PAN -- FULLER -- TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE KIND OF GOT TWO QUESTIONS BEFORE US HERE THAT WE'RE TRYING -- TO LAY OUT -- SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. WITH WHATEVER WE'RE GOING TO DO AT THE END OF THIS MEETING THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING. AND IN THE WAY OF MAYBE MORE OVERSIGHT OR DIFFERENT OVERSIGHT. UP ONE IS -- WHAT THE EFFECT ON THE LIST CALL IT WATER GREETED AS? HE IS -- FOR A DAILY USE AND REGULARLY USE ACROSS THE STATE AND THE OTHER IS WHAT IS THE EFFECT F WATER FIX AND ITS AMENDMENTS AND IT SEEMS LIKE BASICALLY WE'VE LAID OUT TO DIFFERENT OPTIONS NOW. AND I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE FOR A MINUTE -- ISN'T IT TRUE THAT SOME STATE WATER CONTRACTORS HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED YOU ASKING FOR AUTO RENEWAL OF THEIR CONTRACT WHICH WAS ALLOWED IN THEIR CONTRACTS BECAUSE IT PUTS THEM IN A DIFFICULT POSITION NOT TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE BEYOND SEVENTEEN YEARS NOT. TO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE THESE HUGE FACILITIES IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR WATER PLANTS IN YOUR YOUR DISTRICTS AND YOU KNOW THE MILES AND MILES OF PIPELINES AND THE EMPLOYEES AND ALL OF THAT PEOPLE WHO. DEPEND ON THOSE WHOLESALE WATER SUPPLIES GETTING THEM. THOSE AREN'T JUST GOING TO GO AWAY SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO FINANCE THEM AND SEVENTEEN YEARS IS YOU CAN'T EVEN HARDLY FINANCE HOUSE FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS MUCH LESS. THIS KIND OF FACILITY SO ISN'T IT TRUE THAT SOME OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS HAVE ALREADY ASKED FOR AUTO RENEWAL. AS WAS ALLOWED IN A CONTRACT BUT MY MY INFORMATION IS IS THAT IT'S SORT OF THOSE THOSE. THOSE REQUESTS OF SORT OF BEEN IGNORED BY THE DB ARE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS. AUTHORITY TO GO FOR HIS COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT. SURE IN TERMS OF YOUR PRECISE QUESTION ABOUT A REQUEST FOR AUTO RENEWAL I THINK I'LL DEFER TO JOEL LEDESMA -- THE HEAD OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. OKAY OR STEVE. GOOD MORNING STEVE COLIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. THE CONTRACTS A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR LONG CONTRACTS THAT WERE ENTERED INTO IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES HAD A PROVISION IN THERE WE CALL IT AN EVERGREEN PROVISION. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE CONTRACTORS AND NOTICE TO THE DEPARTMENT AT LEAST NINETY DAYS BEFORE THE CONTRACTS EXPIRE. TO HAVE THOSE CONTRACTS RENEWED ON THE SAME COST SPACES THE SAME WATER QUALITY THE SAME DELIVERY. SO SENATOR I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS EVEN THOUGH THE REQUIREMENT IS AT LEAST SIXTY DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THE CONTRACT YOU CAN PUT IN THIS NOTICE. WE'VE HAD ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED THAT NOTICE EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN YEARS IN ADVANCE. OF THE EXPIRATION OF THEIR CONTRACT SO. WE HAVEN'T IGNORED IT WHAT WE'VE DONE. IS HELD TWENTY THREE PUBLIC NEGOTIATING SESSIONS OVER THIRTEEN MONTH PERIOD BACK IN THE TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IT'S A TWENTY FOURTEEN POINT. THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THE THINKING IS. IT'S NICE TO GET IN A SENSE INDIVIDUAL REQUESTS FOR RENEWAL. THIS IS THE POOL CONCEPT OF THE CONTRACTORS ARE CHIPPING IN. FOR OUR DELTA FACILITIES ARE ORVILLE FACILITIES WHAT WE CALL OUR CONSERVATION FACILITIES. WE NEED TO RENEW THESE CONTRACTS ON THE SAME TERMS FOR EVERYBODY SO THE CONTRACT IS A PROVIDED THOSE NOTICES THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO RENEW. THEY WERE PART OF THE TWENTY NINE CONTRACTORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THESE -- IN THESE PUBLIC NEGOTIATIONS AND HAVE SIGNED THE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WHICH IS WHAT RESULTED FROM THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. SO WHAT'S YOUR OPINION THEN TO ANYONE OF YOU ON THE PANELS. THAT BY NOT ALLOWING A LONGER WINDOW FOR WATER AGENCIES TO PLAN AND RENEW ESPECIALLY SINCE WHEN THESE PROJECTS WERE STARTED IT WAS SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AND NOW WE'RE DOWN -- TO SEVENTEEN AND MOST OF THEM HAVE GROWN MULTIPLE IN MULTIPLES MUCH MUCH BIGGER THAN THEY WERE WHEN THEY STARTED [inaudible] THAT. PERHAPS YOU'RE ACTUALLY ENDANGERING THE FISCAL STABILITY OF THE PROJECTS. MORE AS THEN BY. LIKE BY NOT HAVING THIS HEARING THAN BY HAVING THIS HEARING BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DOCTOR PAM BROUGHT UP WAS. IT WHAT IS THIS FINANCIAL STABILITY IF YOU KNOW OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AND WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE. THAT THEY'RE GOING WELL AND IF YOU CONSULT WITH THE HISTORY JACK'S -- HOW THE FINANCIAL? STABILITY WAS BASED WAS REALLY PRETTY STRONG -- BUT THAT WAS BASED ON A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR CONTRACT AND THE ABILITY FOR THEM. TO BE ABLE TO PLAN THEIR OWN RESERVES BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE THE WATER RATE PAYERS PROPERTY RATES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. YEAH SO WHAT THE WHAT IFS ABOVE WE DO NOTHING. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS HEARING TODAY. WOULD BE BE ENDANGERING THE PROJECT MORE OR LESS. I'D I'D ALL RESPOND TO THAT SO WE WOULD BE ENDANGERING THE PROJECT MORE IT'S SIMPLY PUT -- IT WITHOUT THE HEARING TODAY IT WOULD REALLY CHALLENGE THE AFFORDABILITY OF KNOWN PROJECTS THAT. WE NEED TO START BONDING FOR SO THAT WE CAN GET THEM ONLINE. AND CONTINUE TO TO RUN AND OPERATE THE EXISTING SYSTEM WITHOUT THE HEARING TODAY ULTIMATELY THAT BECOMES LESS AND LESS AFFORDABLE TO OUR STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. MANY OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN LOCAL PROJECTS WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND THOSE ARE PROJECTS THAT. ARE MEANT TO INTEGRATE INTO THEIR STATE WATER PROJECT'S SUPPLIES SO. YOU KNOW I THINK -- VERY IMPORTANT AND IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL TO THE NOT ONLY THE PHYSICAL INTEGRITY OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT THAT IS. MAINTAINING ITS AFFORDABILITY BUT ALSO THE WATER SECURITY OF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THEN I WOULD [inaudible] PERHAPS. READ INTO THIS. THAT THE SECOND PART LIKE IF WE GO FORWARD JUST AS WE ARE AND WE WE ALLOW THIS HEARING TO ALLOW BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTS WHICH BY THE WAY FRANKLY SOME OF THE SEA WATER CONTRACTORS FEEL THE NEED TO BE OURS SOMEWHAT LIKE. THE P. YOU SEE INDICATING RATES TO THEM IT'S NOT REALLY THAT PRIVATE PEOPLE COME UP WITH HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO DO BUT REALLY WHAT THAT. THE THE POOL COSTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE. IT IS THE NEW WATER FIX KEYS THAT PERHAPS WOULD BE THE OVERSIGHT PEACE. IF THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SPEND ITS TIME MOST WISELY AND THE OVERSIGHT DOLLARS MOST WIDELY. WHICH WOULD THEN BE IN ANOTHER CONTRACT HOWEVER WE ARE ALLOWING THAT -- TO GO FORWARD BY GIVING THEM. THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE NEW BONDS WITH LONGER TERM SO MY SUGGESTION AS I'M TYPING OUT MY SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE THE STANG. IS THAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR OVERSIGHT. THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEWHERE AROUND NEW BONDS BEING. BEING RENEWED RATHER THAN THE WHOLE STATE WATER CONTRACT AND ITS WHOLE HISTORY WHICH MOSTLY IS PRE EXISTING WHICH IS OPERATING. REALLY VERY WELL AT LEAST UP UNTIL NOW. AND IT WHICH CAN GO FORWARD WITH MORE CERTAINTY AFTER THIS HEARING TODAY IN TERMS OF LOCAL PLANNING. WELL IF THERE IS. ONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN.-I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTORS SOME. PRESENTATION IF IF I CAN SIMPLIFY WHATEVER HEARD THE URGENCY OR BENEFIT. OF THESE AMENDMENTS MOVING FORWARD. IS TO ALLOW THE ISSUANCE OF LONGER TERM BONDS THAT TRANSLATE INTO. LOWER COSTS AND RATES TO PAY OFF THOSE SPONSORS THAT ACCURATE WRECKED YES -- IN I THINK THIS WAS YOUR RESPONSE TO CHAIR MITCHELL BUT JUST TO BE. CLEAR. ARE YOU ABLE TO GIVE US ANY ESTIMATE OF THOSE SAVINGS HOW. THE UNIVERSE OF SAVINGS THAT MAY TRANSLATE. TO TO RATEPAYERS. ARM. WITH THE ABILITY TO TO ISSUE LONGER TERM BONDS OR WAS THAT WHAT YOU SAID YOU'RE GETTING TO US NEXT WEEK NO THAT'S THAT SEPARATE -- WITH THEM OKAY YES SO SO WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION -- THERE IT'S IT'S REALLY CENTERS AROUND AT SERVICE AND WHAT OUR ANNUAL DEBT SERVICE PAYMENT WILL BE IF WE CONTINUE TO DELAY. AND JUST AS A AS A MARKER IF YOU WILL WE ANTICIPATE THE DEBT SERVICE ON REVENUE BONDS WOULD IN EFFECT REALLY DOUBLE -- IF WE WERE UNABLE TO EXTEND THE CONTRACTS IN ISSUE BONDS AND AND WEREN'T LET'S SAY LIMITED -- TO THE REMAINING TEN YEARS FOR EXAMPLE IF WE IF WE PURSUED THIS EXTENSION -- DISCUSSION OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS YOU CAN VERY QUICKLY GET TO SET SITUATION WHICH YOU'RE DOUBLING THAT THE DEBT SERVICE. FOR BRIAN IS IT FAIR TO EXTRAPOLATE IF YOU DOUBLE THE DEBT SERVICE THAT. YOU'RE GONNA DOUBLE POTENTIAL RATES TO REPAIRS. OR I WOULD YOU KNOW I WOULD DEFER TO THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THEY ARE -- THEY ARE THE ONES WHO LATELY -- ESTABLISH THE RATES THAT -- BEN AND HOW THOSE OF RATES ACTUALLY AFFECT THEIR RATE PAYERS AND THAT'S TYPICALLY A MIX OF NOT ONLY STATE WATER PROJECT CHARGES. BUT ALSO THEIR LOCAL PROJECTS -- BUT ULTIMATELY YOU CAN ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT CROSS COST INCREASE TO BE PASSED ALONG. THROUGH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTS. THANK YOU SOON NOW SHIFTING BACK TO THE CORRELATION WITH THE WATER FIX. CLEARLY WHAT YOU DESCRIBED. IS BROADER THAN THE WATER FIX BUT YOU'VE ALSO. DISCUSSED OPENLY THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION. WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE WATER FIX NEGOTIATIONS IN TERMS OF TIME TABLE [inaudible] PUBLIC. INPUT INTO THAT PROCESS. AND LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. FOR ANY CONTRACTS THAT ARE NEGOTIATED ON THE WATER FIX. SO THE PUBLIC PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS ON THE ONE THAT WE USE FOR THE WATER FIX AMENDMENT IS THE SAME ONE THAT WE USE FOR THE CONTRACT EXTENSIONS WE ARE OBLIGATED TO HOLD THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND PUBLIC. THEY BEGAN -- IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR AND WENT THROUGH JUNE -- WE HAVE A DRAFT AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE THAT IS THE THE DOCUMENT BY WHICH OUR OUR ATTORNEYS START -- TO RIGHT AND AND THEN THAT -- ALSO GOES THROUGH ITS OWN -- SEQUEL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW -- WHICH IS A PROCESS THAT IS JUST UNDER WAY I THINK WE HAVE A NOTICE OF DETERMINATION AS OF MAYBE A MONTH AGO -- THOSE AS I MENTION THOSE NEGOTIATIONS -- WERE HELD WITH PUBLIC NOTICE WE DID GET SOME FEEDBACK -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT AND WE CAN CERTAINLY IN THE FUTURE -- MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURES RECEIVING THOSE KINDS OF NOTIFICATIONS -- BUT THAT'S HE TIMELINE FOR THE THOUGH WATER FIX AMENDMENT WE WOULDN'T EXPECT IT -- TO BE COMPLETED UNTIL THAT THE VERY END OF THIS YEAR. SO THAT'S ELPFUL BUT WHAT I HEAR IN THERE IS THAT WHILE WE MIGHT RECEIVE SOME NOTICE. THERE IS NO LET JUST DIRECT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT RELATED TO THOSE NEGOTIATED AMENDMENTS ON THE WATER FIX. CORRECT THERE IS NOT THE LEGISLATIVE THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT THAT YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH A CONTRACT EXTENSION. SO WHAT WHAT ARE THE PATHWAYS. FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHTOF THE WATER FIX IN THOSE NEGOTIATED AMENDMENTS. WELL YOU KNOW I WOULD DEFER TO THE THE LA -- I MEAN THAT. OVERSIGHT IS I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE THE PURVIEW OF THIS BODY IF YOU WILL -- AND WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OF BRINGING THAT INFORMATION -- TO IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD FRANKLY DEFER TO THE LEGISLATIVE BODY ABOUT -- HOW? DO YOU WOULD WANT TO EXERCISE -- SOME DEGREE OF OF OVERSIGHT OVER THOSE THAT AMENDMENT PROCEDURE. THANK YOU MAYBE COULD I JUST. TURNED TO THE LA -- AND GET YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION YEAH I THINK THERE IS NO STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ON THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW. AND SO I THINK -- HAS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED IT IS YOUR BEER PER VIDEO -- TO TO EXERCISE THE OVERSIGHT THAT YOU FEEL IS APPROPRIATE EITHER BY REQUESTING THAT THEY COME IN HAVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS IN. AND PRESENT -- OR IF THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND YOU FEEL THAT IT NEEDS TO BE STATUTORY OR MORE RIGOROUS THAN TO TAKE ACTION TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THAT. SO THAT IS A POTENTIAL PATHWAY -- WE DID CONVENE AN OVERSIGHT HEARING A NATURIST SOURCES IN WATER COMMITTEE FOR IN ENDING IN AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. BUT WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT. A PATH TO EXPLORE COULD BE -- RIGHT AT THE CHECK IN AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED THERE WAS A PROPOSAL FROM MISTER BLOOM AND THAT DIDN'T AND ULTIMATELY MOVER GET ENACTED THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SOME NOTIFICATION TO THE JAIL BC AND SOME DELAY. BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE A FACT AND TELL THEM THE WC HAD REVIEWED IT. SO -- WHILE THAT BILL DIDN'T PASS AND AND AND COULD BE RESURRECTED IN THE FUTURE -- YET YOU KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH YOU AND SO YOU COULD REQUEST THAT YOU GET SUBMITTED AND HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW AND THEN IF THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT FOLLOW THROUGH. AT GIVEN THAT THE LEGISLATURES IN RECESS RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU AND I THINK. WE'LL BE HEARING FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SO I THINK THAT DOES INFORM IN A BROADER IF CONCERN OF MANY PEOPLE HERE TODAY. BUT I ALSO DO RECOGNIZE THAT THE KIND OF PRO FORMA INFORMATIONAL GATHERING HERE TODAY. SERVES A PURPOSE. PERHAPS MORE IMMEDIATELY FOR THE BROADER STATE WIND. WATER PROJECT -- IN PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES -- SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR A FOLLOW UP VERY QUICKLY BEFORE WE MOVE TO DOCTOR PAN -- AGAIN 640-9 WAS. UNFORTUNATELY JUST ADMITTED AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH AND SO WE DIDN'T GET TO REALLY SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY BECAUSE IT WOULD. ANSWER IT WOULD BE AN ANSWER FOR US AS THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF DOCUMENTING THE MAKING INTO LAW IF THE GOVERNOR SOFFIT TO SIGN IT WHAT OUR OFFICIAL ROLE IS BUT AGAIN WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'M CLEAR. THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN -- EXERCISE ARE RIPE FOR OVERSIGHT IS ABOUT -- YOU KNOW NEGOTIATIONS CONVERSATIONS FOR ONE THING I WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU -- WE'RE CLEAR THAT THE CURRENT AMENDMENT BEFORE US TODAY WAS A FIVE YEAR PROCESS. AND YET I ATE SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO REALLY GET A SENSE OF IF IF THIS IS WISHFUL THINKING THAT YOU'RE HOPING THAT YOU'LL BE DONE WITH. THE WATER FIX AMENDMENT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT WAS ON A MUCH FASTER TRACK. THEN CERTAINLY THE CURRENT AMENDMENT AND SO. HOW REALISTIC IS THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR IN TERMS OF COMPLETING THAT PROCESS -- WELL YOU KNOW WE LIKE. TO WE LIKE TO DO THINGS WITH ALL DELIBERATE SPEED -- AND NEED A KEY MILESTONE IS GAY IN PRINCIPLE -- AND WE SET OURSELVES A FAIRLY RIGOROUS TIMELINE AND WE'VE EFFECTIVELY MET THAT TIME LINE -- WE DO NEED TO DRAFT AND WE NEED TO COMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS AND YOU KNOW WE'LL KEEP MOVING WE THINK THAT'S A REALISTIC SCHEDULE WHETHER OR NOT WERE ABLE TO MEET IT -- HIM. CURRENTLY IN EVEN COLLEAGUES EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN THE INTERIM -- SHE'LL BE SEE. POLICY COMMITTEES INDIVIDUALS CAN CERTAINLY OUR LEADERSHIP CAN CERTAINLY ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH THE DIRECTOR TO REALLY TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT OVERSIGHT WILL LOOK LIKE -- OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW MONTHS [inaudible] DOCTOR PAYNE. THANK YOU AND THAT ONE THANK -- DIRECTOR AND YOUR STAFF FOR BEING HERE TODAY -- SO AT THE END I APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU KNOW WE ARE FACING A CRUNCH IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DO LONG TERM FINANCING FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH IS AGAIN AS I SAID IN MY OPENING VERY CRITICAL TO THE STATE. SO I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT. I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION I JUST HAVE BECAUSE YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIRTY YEAR BONDS IT'S A STANDARD THING -- SO WHAT THESE CONTRACTS DO IS THEY GO OUT TO TWENTY EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS SIXTY SEVEN YEARS AWAY FROM NOW. SO THERE'S THE TIES SEES IT FIFTY BUT ACTUALLY FIFTY YEARS PLUS THE TIME WE HAD SEVENTEEN YOURSELF I MEAN SIXTY SEVEN YEARS IS. WIDE SIXTY SEVEN YEARS AND SO THAT'S TWICE AS LONG AS SIX THAT'S TWICE AS LONG AS THE THE MORE TWICE AS LONG ACTUALLY YOU KNOW -- SO -- THAT WHY WHY SO QUITE SO FAR OUT. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THE RATIONALE FOR THE EXTENSION I MEAN I GET I GET THE THE WAY IT WORKS THE CRUNCH THAT SEVENTEEN BUT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST EXACTLY THIRTY BECAUSE YOU HAVE FEARS BUT WHY SO FAR OUT YES -- WE HAVE FIFTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW OPERATING THE WATER PLUS OF LESS THAN YOUR AT EXTENSION ASKING. FOR FIFTY EIGHT YEARS ASKING FOR SIXTY SEVEN NOW BUT OUR ORIGINAL. CONTRACT TERMS GO OUT. HI SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AND SOME OF THEM DON'T I EXPIRE UNTIL TWENTY FORTY TWO DOES FOR THE LAST CONTRACTORS TO SIGN UP. WITH SIXTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT GOING OUT ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS. MAKES SENSE IN AND GOING OUT FIFTY YEARS FROM TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT NOT GETTING INTO THIS COMPRESSION PROBLEM. WHICH IS. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN RAISING THE MONEY WE NEED -- TO REPAIR AND RECONSTRUCT INTO OUR SEISMIC REPAIRS SO THE THINKING WAS. WE GO OUT FIFTY YEARS -- COMPRESSION THIS COMPRESSION PROBLEM WE'RE FACING NOW WE'LL HAVE SOME LEEWAY WILL HAVE -- BEFORE THIS STARTS OCCURRING AGAIN. AND IN IT AND IT'S REALLY CONSISTENT WITH. FIRST TERM WAS SEVENTY FIVE YEARS SECOND TERM OF FIFTY YEARS SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE FOR A PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE OF THIS COST OF THE SIGNIFICANCE TO THE STATE. AT THAT I I GUESS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT I MEAN I DON'T CONCEPTUALLY HOW TO GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING -- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT -- THAT'S A LOT OF TIME AYERS WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE. HERE ON THE TH WHAT WHAT WE'LL BE DOING IN THIRTY YEARS AND OUR SUCCESSORS AND SO FORTH AND SO I MEAN I I I I GET THAT WHEN YOU SAID. FIFTY YEARS ACTUALLY SAID THIS IS SIXTY SEVEN YEARS SO I MEAN IT'S ANOTHER SEVENTEEN YEARS BEYOND THAT FROM TODAY. RIGHT SO I I I I I GET THAT WE STARTED AT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS -- BUT BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF ON GOING OVERSIGHT AND SO FORTH THAT'S A REALLY LONG TIME AND THAT. MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO THAT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED IS OF COURSE AS WE GET CLOSER YOU GET COMPRESSION RATE BUT FRANKLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST THIRTY YEARS IT'S DIFFICULT THING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN YEARS OF NINE COMPRESSION SO -- DOES IT HAVE TO BE THAT LONG I MEAN I MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO BE HERE BEYOND THE TERM LIMITS ASSUMING THE VOTERS DON'T CHANGE A TERM LIMITS I MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO BE AROUND HERE. IN THE LAST ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT THE I MEAN CERTAINLY. THAT JUST SEEMS TO BE A VERY LONG TIME IF I COULD ADD AN ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS. FOR CONSIDERATION AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE PLANNED -- WE HAVE AN ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT -- THAT'S WHERE WE ASSESS -- THE NEEDS OF ALL THE STATE WATER PROJECT ASSETS AND AND SET OUT -- RESPONSIBLE COURSE FOR THE REPAIRS WE LOOK AT A FIFTY YEAR TIME FRAME AND THAT ALSO CORRESPONDS TO THE THE LIKELY. LIFE CYCLE OF FACILITIES OF THIS MAGNITUDE SO THAT IS. ALSO VERY MUCH PART OF OUR THINKING IS THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE PROJECTS WE ANTICIPATE OF THESE KIND OF REVENUE BONDS WOULD FUND OKAY SO RIGHT AWAY WHAT I KEEP HEARING IS IT HEARD THIRTY YEARS FOR A LOT FOR FINANCING. RIGHT AND NOW I'M HEARING FIFTY YEARS. AND THEN WE HAVE SIXTY SEVEN YEARS SO -- I GUESS AT THAT. I I WOULD IN AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A MEAN THIS IS NOT FOR ME AND THAT WILL BE AN OFFICE THEN BUT I I DO THINK IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT IT CETERA THAT. MAYBE WE OUGHT TO HAVE A CYCLE THAT MAKES YOU KNOW IT AND THEN PUT THAT MEANS IS THAT IT'S NOT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE. THAT DOES MEAN THAT MAYBE EVERY DECADE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THESE CONTRACTS THINGS INSTEAD OF THIRTY EL TWENTY THIRTY YEARS OUT EVERY THIRTY YEARS I MEAN I JUST. RIGHT EVERY TIME RIGHT SO BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WERE YOU ACTUALLY DOING IT YOU KNOW AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE END WILL PUSH IT OUT WILL PUSH IT OUT BECAUSE EXACTLY WE WE DON'T WANT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW YOU. TO DO LONG TERM FINANCING WE WANT YOU TO THINK YOU KNOW AND LONG TERMS THAT YOU HAVE ASSETS THAT ARE BUT ALSO I THINK IN TERMS OF BEING SURE THAT'S THE IT'S A PUBLIC I MEAN SO IMPORTANT EVERYONE'S PUBLIC PROCESS THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE ENGAGE THAT. PEOPLE ARE COMING BACK WE'RE HAVING THESE TYPES OF YOUR IT HAPPENED ONCE EVERY THIRTY YEARS SO JUST JUST WHAT THROW THAT OUT THERE. LET ME VERY QUICKLY WITH TURBO RETURN TO SENDER FULLER FOR A FOLLOW UP AND THEN I'LL COME BACK HERE TO MISTER FRAZIER AND THEN SENATOR GAL JOHNNY. SORRY YOU HAVE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS OKAY HANG ON LET ME DO A QUICK FOLLOW UP AND I'LL CONNECT YOU. TO GO BACK INTO MY CLEAR FULLER -- ON THIS POINT -- PERHAPS IT WOULD BE EASIER IF WE ASK. THE DIRECTOR TO PROVIDE US WITH. SOME INFORMATION SUCH AS WHAT IS THE BOND DEFAULT RATE IF THERE IS. ONE OF A WHAT IS THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF YEARS -- BEFORE DID ON THE DEFAULT RATE. AND THEN WE MAY BE TAKE THAT INFORMATION IF THAT COULD BE SENT TO THE CHAIR HAVE A SMALL SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WE LOOK OVER. AND THEN WE HAVE SOME BETTER CONCLUSIONS. ABOUT. NEW BONDS AND NEW BOND OVERSIGHT BASED ON SOME STATISTICS SINCE. ADMITTEDLY THEY HAVE SIXTY EIGHT YEARS OR SO. EXPERIENCE IF WE FIND FOR EXAMPLE THAT THERE IS RELATIVELY FEW BOND DEFAULTS OR IF THERE IS A A PERIOD IT'S WORSE SHORT OR LONG. THEN IT WE COULD MAYBE DRILL DOWN JUST ON THOSE AREAS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING WITH TWENTY NINE STAY WATER CONTRACTORS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HUGE. DATABASE AND SO THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT HELP GET TO THE PLACE YOU WANNA START. AND WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT JUST BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS CURIOUS I PARTICULARLY LIKE YOU TO ADD SOME INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THE COLD FIRED PLANTS IN NEVADA THAT WAS. ESTABLISHED IN GOVERNOR BROWN'S FIRST. OF ROUND HERE A DEFAULTED ON THE BONDS ARE PAID OFF OF WHAT WE DID ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT WILL BE THE PROVIDE GREAT INSURANCE FOR US IF IT WAS WELL DEALT WITH. THAT EVEN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS CAN BE ADDRESSED. OR IT WILL GIVE YOU A A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT YOU'RE. TRYING TO OVERSIGHT AND PREVENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND DOCTOR BANDS. THANK YOU ENTER SO THE NEXT I GUESS THE OTHER COURT IS THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE IS ACTUALLY. IS SO ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS -- BASICALLY ALLOW ISSUE BONDS IN CHARGE CONTRACTORS REGARDLESS SO RESISTANCE BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND ALSO TO FINANCE OTHER CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT WERE NOT ARRAY LIST IN THE CONTRACT. IF THE DEPARTMENT 80% -- AFFECTED CONTRACTORS TO FIND MUTUALLY AGREES WITH THIS SEEMS TO BE PRETTY OPEN ENDED. I MEAN CLEARLY THAT CONTRACTORS NEWBIE ON BOARD BUT AT THE END SO I I JUST DO HAVE TO ASK IS IS THAT. IS THIS ISN'T T WHO IS THE WELL THE DEPARTMENT CLEARLY DECLARED HERE IN PUBLIC AT THIS HEARING THAT THAT PROVISION WILL NOT BE USED TO FINANCE -- THE WATER FIX AND THAT WE WILL NOT BE FLOATING BONDS TO FINANCE TO FUND THE WATER FIX USING THIS MECHANISM -- USING THIS STUFF AT THIS -- AMENDMENT PROPOSED AMENDMENT CONTRACT AMENDMENT. SO -- IF I COULD JUST TAKE A STEP BACK -- SO. WE DO HAVE A LIST OF FACILITIES AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST DECADES IT BECAME CLEAR -- THAT IF WE WERE OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE ON THAT LIST IT DISABLED THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY -- TO TO CAPITALIZE IMPORTANT PROJECTS SOME OF IT IS EMBRACING NEW TECHNOLOGIES SO AND SKATE A SYSTEMS CAME ONLINE ETCETERA -- THE DELTA FACILITIES THE LISTING OF ADULT OF FACILITIES EIGHT TOPICAL AREAS ALREADY USED TO FUND IMPORTANT PROJECTS IN THE DELTA SUCH AS A LEVY WORKING THIS IS SOON MARSH. A FEW SCREENS THAT WE'RE DOING SOME WORK OUT IN THE A LITTLE BY PASS ON THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT -- THAT THIS CONTRACT EXTENSION WOULD ENABLE US TO CONTINUE TO PROCEED WITH THE WATER FIX PIECE IS THE PEACE WHERE AS A SEPARATE AMENDMENT WHERE WE DIVIDE OUT COST ALLOCATION IT'S IT'S VERY CRITICAL BECAUSE AS YOU MAY BE AWARE. WE HAVE NORTH OF DELTA CONTRACTORS WHO WOULD NOT RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF WATER FIX AND THEREFORE DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT. AND WE HAVE OTHER PARTIES -- THAT WOULD LIKE TO TRANSFER THEIR INCREMENTAL BENEFIT FROM WATER FIX TO OTHER STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. AND THAT'S THE WAY IN WHICH WE ARE INSURING -- IN THE CONTEXT OF A CONTRACT AMENDMENT THAT THERE THAT WATER FIX IS PAID FOR ONLY BY THOSE PARTIES -- WHO SEE A BENEFIT AND ACTUALLY WANT TO PAY FOR THAT KIND OF I I DON'T HEAR AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION SO AGAIN I'LL ASK MY QUESTION AGAIN SERVE WILL? CAN YOU STATE HERE CLEARLY THAT WE YOU WILL NOT BE USING THIS AMENDMENT WHICH ALLOWS. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OTHER COUPLE PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT READY LISTEN THE EXISTING CONTRACTS. DEAD DEAD BASICALLY WERE KNOCKED ME USING BASICALLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE FINANCING THE WATER -- SIX USING THIS WEEK I GET THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN WE HAVE CAPITAL PROJECTS FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS. PROVISION IS NOT GOING TO USE TO BASICALLY FIVE EFFECTS AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE TILES. WILL. HERE'S HERE'S THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION SO WE SAY YES OR NO. ABOUT OUR TEAM JUST SIMPLY CANNOT DO THAT -- NO BECAUSE WE WILL USE PART OF THIS CONTRACT AMENDMENT TO HELP FINANCE WATER FIX AND HERE'S WHY. BECAUSE WATER FIX INCLUDES WHAT IT SAID. IT AS ENABLES US -- TO ISSUE REVENUE BONDS INTO THE FUTURE WE HAVE A CATEGORY THAT EXISTS IN OUR CURRENT CONTRACTS THAT AS PART OF THIS NEW AMENDMENT MOVING FORWARD. THAT -- DESCRIBES THE ABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FUN PROJECTS IN THE DELTA INCLUDING DELTA FACILITIES AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE WATER FIX SO YOU JUST SAID YES YES WE'LL BE USING THIS PROVISION OF THE WATER FIX AND IN THE WATER AND THE DEPARTMENT IS. PURSUING A VALIDATION. WORDS THAT WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO SIR I I WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU. TRANSPARENCY IS ESSENTIAL AND SO THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT -- ASSUMING IT HAS THE ALLOCATION FOR A LOOK THOUGH IN OKAY SO SO I WILL I JUST SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WHAT I WAS TOLD THE HEARING WAS ABOUT WAS ABOUT. THE REST OF THE STATE THE STATE WATER PROJECT CAN BE SURE WE KEEP THAT MAINTAIN BUT YOU HAVE JUST SAID. HERE THIS HEARING THAT YOU ALSO WITH THE PURPOSE OF THIS WAS TO TRY. TO FLOAT BONDS TO FUND THE WHAT IT DOES TUNNELS LET ME CLARIFY WE CANNOT FIND ANYTHING RELATED TO WATER FIX UNTIL THE WATER FIX CONTRACT AMENDMENT OKAY SO LET ME GO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION THAN WHAT WAS SO YOU SAID YOU'RE WORKING ON THE ACTIVE AND CAN I JUST BRING. THE QUESTION A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU DID. BECAUSE I I THINK WE'RE HAVING THIS KIND OF CONVERSATIONS I WANT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR QUESTION GETS ANSWERED AND YOU ANSWER IT. TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY IN TERMS OF WHAT YOUR TENNIS. IS FUNDING FOR THE WATER FIX PROJECT LINKED TO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS BEFORE US TODAY. NO THIS IS GOOD EXTENDS THE CONTRACTS. WELL THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU JUST SAID. SO CAN YOU SAY CLEARLY I'M GONNA ASK YOU THEN THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY THAT WE WILL NOT BE USING THE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS THERE BEFORE US TO FINANCE. THE WATER FIX INCLUDING FLOATING BONDS RIGHT SO. THE THREE PART ANSWER AND YOU FEEL FREE OF ME SO THE CONTRACT NUMBER FOR YOU TO KNOW. THE CONTRACT AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU TODAY. EXTENDS THE CONTRACTS WHICH ENABLES THE DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE BONDS OVER THE LONG TERM. WATER FIX IS A PROJECT IN WHICH WE DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT AMENDMENT IN PLACE YET. THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DO SO SO WHEN THAT AMENDMENT IS COMPLETED. THAT AMENDMENT WHICH STIPULATES HOW WE WOULD CHARGE OUR CUSTOMERS WOULD ESSENTIALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS EXTENSION. OF THE WATER CONTRACTS AND THE ABILITY TO ISSUE LONG TERM REVENUE BONDS. AS A MECHANISM TO FINANCE WATER FIX SO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT WHEN YOU SAY FINANCE OTHER CAPITAL PROJECTS THREE NOT LISTED THAT THAT'S AN OPEN ENDED THING TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. WE HAVE CAUGHT WE HAVE CAPITAL PROJECT CATEGORIES AND WE ALSO HAVE A FINANCE COMMITTEE THAT'S PART OF THIS AMENDMENT THAT ESTABLISHES A DIALOGUE WITH OUR WATER CONTRACTORS. TO DESCRIBE THE CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED -- OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT. SEVERAL DECADES. OKAY SO LET ME -- SO WHEN YOU MENTION THESE WATER FIX AMENDMENTS AND EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT THEN SO ARE YOU GOING TO RETURN TO THE LEGISLATURE AND AMP SO I'VE GOT IT WE DON'T HAVE STATUTORY. RIGHT BUT NOT EVERYTHING REQUIRES A LOT. WE CAN DO THINGS WITHOUT LOSS THAT WE CAN DO THAT ON OUR OWN SO ARE YOU GOING TO COME BACK. TO YOU CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT HERE YOU'VE GOT RETURNED WITH THE WATER FIX AMENDMENTS. TO THE APPROPRIATE AT THAT WELL I'VE DEFERRED TO THE CHAIR BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WITH HER FOR JAIL BC AND ALSO PERHAPS APPROPRIATE POLICY COMMITTEE WHERE WE WILL HAVE. HEARINGS ABOUT -- PUBLIC HEARINGS ABOUT THE THE WATER SIX AMENDMENTS FOR BEFORE BEFORE THEY ARE ACTUALLY A FINALIZED AND SIGNED. I'D BE GLAD TO MEET WITH ANY LEGISLATOR ON AND I'M SAYING WELL YOU BRING THEM PUBLIC AT A HEARING. WELL THAT WOULD BE UP TO US TO ACTUALLY CONVENIENCE I THINK. THAT A PART OF THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT PENCIL WHAT I AM HEARING FROM DIRECTED NAME IF IT'S A WILLINGNESS TO RESPOND TO THE LEGISLATURE. EITHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSE TO CONVENE OURSELVES IN SOME CAPACITY A POLICY COMMITTEE WHATEVER THE CASE THE CASE IT IS WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE DIRECTOR AS A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE. OKAY IS THAT WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE INCLUDES -- ASSUMING THAT THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES ASIDE TO HOLD THE HEARINGS -- TO APTITUDE TO TO STOCK TO HOLD THOSE HEARINGS PRIOR TO THOSE -- CONTRACTS BEING FINALIZED AND BIG AND SIGNED. BY I BELIEVE THAT'S UP TO THE PURVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ESTABLISH THOSE OPPORTUNITIES I AM WELL WITH THE RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP YOU FROM GOING FORWARD INTO SIGNING THEM AND THEN TELLING US LATER SO THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO GET. THIS THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU IS THAT YOU GIVE US A PROPIONYL IT IS SO WE CAN ACTUALLY IF WE CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE A HEARING THAT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IT'S ON US. BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY IS THAT. RIGHT THE D. ARE YOU GOING TO COOPERATE TO THE DEGREE OF ACTUALLY AND FORMING THE LEGISLATURE IN A TIMELY MATTER TO ALLOW US TO HAVE THE HEARING. CERTAINLY I WANT TO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE WATER FIX CONTRACT AMENDMENT ITSELF IS SUBJECT TO SEQUEL REVIEW. ON THESE THIS INFORMATION IS ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND I WOULD BE GLAD TO MEET WITH. ANY MEMBER OR SHOULD YOU ESTABLISH A A POLICY COMMITTEE OR GROUP THAT WANTS TO HEAR THAT INFORMATION I AM. I AM. CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO TALKING ABOUT IT PUBLICLY IN IT AND IT IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE NOW. OKAY WELL I THINK THERE WILL CERTAINLY ISN'T IT AS AN INDIVIDUAL LEGISLATOR WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU BUT ALSO WOULD ALSO URGE THAT WE HAVE. A PUBLIC HEARING ABOUT THAT -- AND AGAIN IN A TIMELY MY FINAL QUESTION APPRECIATE CONSULTANTS TO THE CHAIR I DID ASK THE QUESTION L. A. L. BUT THE FOLLOW UP -- IN TERMS OF THESE CONTRACTS WHAT'S THE LIABILITY TO THE STATE. US OF A CONTRACTOR SEVERAL CONTRACTORS -- HAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS ARE UNABLE TO WHAT POINT DOES THE STATE HAVE TO STEP IN AND INTERVENE [inaudible] RECEIVE. STEVE GOING AGAIN. WE CURRENTLY SELL REVENUE BONDS IS SUPPOSED TO GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS REVENUE BONDS ARE BACKED BY A SOURCE OF REVENUE THAT WE DESIGNATE IN OUR RESOLUTION IN THAT THE BOND HOLDERS ARE AWARE OF BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACT WITH THE BOND HOLDERS IN EFFECT. OUR ONLY SOURCE OF REVENUES THAT WE PLEDGED TO PAY OUR REVENUE BONDS ARE RECEIPTS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR WATER CONTRACTORS. AND AND SO THERE WOULD BE. ZERO LIABILITY TO THE STATE OR THE STATE GENERAL FUND IF THERE WERE A DEFAULT. IN ALONG THOSE LINES AND I THINK SENATOR FULL OR GET TO IT IN WITH THE THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES CURRENTLY RECEIVES FROM THE STANDARD AND POOR'S A TRIPLE A BOND RATING. ON A REVENUE BONDS IT'S VERY HIGH IT'S BACKED BY. THE THE REALLY FINE FINANCIAL -- CONDITION OF OUR WATER CONTRACTORS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT. PAY US THE BILLS THAT WE PAY OUR BILLS THAT WE THEN IN TURN PAY OUR DEBT SERVICE ON SO. IT'S ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS A BURNS PORTER ACT -- PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN -- IN NINETEEN SIXTY THE STAB WHICH THE STATE WATER PROJECT. THAT PROVIDED A ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. BOND ISSUE GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND ISSUE. THAT'S VERY CLOSE TO BEING PAID OFF I MEAN I THINK I THINK WE HAVE. A WE JUST DON'T HAVE WHAT WE PAID MOST OF THAT'S WHERE THE ONLY LIABILITY WOULD BE WE HAVE NEVER HAD A DEFAULT OF OUR WATER CONTRACTORS. IN THE PAYMENT OF THEIR BILLS TO US IN IN TURN WE'VE NEVER DEFAULTED ON PAIN OUR BOND HOLDERS THE DEBT SERVICE THAT. THAT WE JUST TO CLARIFY DOES THE ONE INITIAL MIND YOU SAID THAT -- WORK LIFE. SO THE SECOND REVENUE BONDS VERSUS ONE INITIAL BOND -- GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND YET THE ONE THAT YOU MADE REFERENCE TO RIGHT YEAH WE IN NIGHT THAT'S SORTED JUMPSTARTED THE STATE WATER PROJECT KNOW HOW MUCH HOW MUCH. IT WE WERE YOU WE REPAY REPEATED INTO. HAS RECEIVED PAYMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO PAY THE DEBT SERVICE AND THEN HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE HAVE ON THAT -- I THINK IT GOES INTO THE MIDDLE TWENTY TWENTIES BUT WE MAY BE. WE MAY -- LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON ALL RIGHT. WELL YOU MENTION FIFTY EIGHT YEARS I SOUL YEAH YOU'RE PAID THAT OFF BY NOW AND I MIGHT MENTION JUST. TO SHOW YOU TIME LENGTH THOSE ORIGINAL GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS THAT WERE ISSUED IN THE SIXTIES AND EARLY SEVENTIES THEY WENT OUT FIFTY YEARS. THERE IS A REALLY LONG TERM HORIZON FOR A PROJECT. NOT LIKE IT OF THE SITES. ARE. THANK YOU OF JUST BEFORE I MOVE ON TO A THREE MEMBER FRASIER. I WANTED TO JUST DIRECTOR NAMED ASK YOU TO ONE MORE TIME. PROVIDE THE CLARIFICATION AND I'M GONNA SAY IT IN MY LANGUAGE AND I WANT YOU TO SAY THUMBS UP THUMBS DOWN OR RESTATED BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT -- THE RECORD ACCURATELY PHRACK REFLECTS THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION. YOU KNOW THE AMENDMENT TODAY CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND THESE BONDS HERE. THE WATER FIX AMENDMENT -- IT'S NOT ON THIS CONTINUUM. MINUTE AS A SECOND SEPARATE TO PROCESS. THAT IF THE ENGAGED. WOULD DIDN'T PERHAPS BENEFIT FROM. THE ACTIONS TAKEN HERE BUT IT IS NOT -- A FOREGONE CONCLUSION CORRECT SOLD. ME RESETTING YOUR LANGUAGE. SO ON MY EVERYBODY'S CLEAR THE AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU TODAY. EXTENDS THE CONTRACTS WHICH ENABLES THE DEPARTMENT -- TO ISSUE LONG TERM REVENUE BONDS -- FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS FOR THE STATE WATER PER. THAT IN AND OF ITSELF -- DOES NOT AUTHORIZE WATER FIX. AND DOES NOT AUTHORIZE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BUILD TO BUILD WATER FIX OR CHARGES WATER CONTRACTORS FOR WATER AFFECTS THE AUTHORIZATION FOR WATER FIX IS A SECOND SEPARATE. CONTRACT AMENDMENT PROCESS YES OKAY. WITH -- THANK YOU GOING BACK TO PAN I'M TRYING TO MANAGE THIS WHOLE PROCESS HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRASIER MANAGER YOU DOING WELL. THE DIRECTOR YOU KNOW YOU WE LOOK AT THE EXHILARATION OF OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. YOU KNOW AT A PROJECT WHEN YOU ARRIVE TALKED ABOUT IN IN MY DISTRICT WAS CALLED TOUCH THE TITLE. HER PROJECT ROOMS IN TITLE IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO AND HERO. ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ALL THE PROCESSES WE JUST PROGRAM THIS YEAR [inaudible] SIXTEEN YEARS. BUT THIS PROCESS YOU XCELERATED. SO MY DISTRICT IN MATTER THAT PROJECT IN MATTER BUT WAS A RESTORATION OF TIED AND WATER LINES IN THE DELTA WOULD HELP THE HEALTH OF THE DELTA. BUT WE'VE XCELERATED THIS PROJECT TO NO END TO MAKE SURE THAT. SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE CATERED. TO BUT THE PEOPLE THE DELTA WERE LEFT ON THE BACK CAN'T. AND O WE LOOK AT THESE THESE -- EXHILARATION SO YOU CAN GET BONDING AND ONE NOT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT FACTORS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM YOUR YOUR EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE OR WHATEVER AND AND WHO SITS ON THAT IS IT AGENCY PEOPLE OR IS IT PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY HAVE VALUE. STAKEHOLDERS THAT ACTUALLY CAN WEIGH IN. OR IS IT JUST A RUBBER STAMP LIKE. MOST AGENCIES DO HAVE. AN INTERNAL -- BUT YOU KNOW JUST GENTLY BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE PACES -- MY CONCERN IS IS THAT YOU HAVE THE STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD. THAT CAN ACTUALLY STOP ANY FLOAT ANY PROJECT. AND ACCELERATE THROUGH PUT THROUGH THE DELTA [inaudible] ONE DETERMINATION -- WHICH WOULD COMPLETELY. BLOW [inaudible] YOUR ABILITY -- TO PAY FOR A DEBT SERVICE. ON THE OTHER PROCESS IS. YOU KNOW THERE'S A PROJECTION OF A POSSIBLY OF AN EXTENDED DROUGHT. UP TO TEN YEARS. SO YOU'RE CIRCUMVENTING THE LOWER DELTA BY DOING IT OF A WATER FIX. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE RATE PAYERS AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE TAXPAYERS. AND AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT ORVILLE. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SPILL WAY. YET POOR. CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES. WHERE WHAT'S THE COST WHERE WE ARE NOW ON THAT PROJECT? IS IT OVER BILLION. YES ONE POINT ONE BILLION. OKAY. SO [inaudible] SEEING THAT. THAT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS COULD HAVE BEEN UTILIZED FOR SO MANY OTHER PROJECTS HAVE THE PROJECT AND DONE WELL -- I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TRUST. BEING ABLE TO TRUST IS TO ME -- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU IN A LOT OF OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN JAMMED THIS SEEMS THIS WHOLE PROCESS FOR CONTRACT EXTENSIONS. ABSOLUTELY IS BEING JAM. AND WHEN YOU HAVE SEVENTEEN YEARS TO TO INCLUDE THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDE THE PUBLIC. I THINK THAT SERIOUSLY WE NEED TO GO TO A PROCESS WHERE. THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPENDITURE PLAN TO THE THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO APPROVE -- WE'VE SEEN IT ON OTHER PROJECTS YOU KNOW A MANAGER -- THAT. WE'RE TAKING A GOOD FAITH THAT THE YOU'RE JUST GONNA DO RIGHT WELL WE HAVE A ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR EXPENSE. NOW. THAT. WE HAD TRUST IN AN AGENCY AND WASN'T DONE RIGHT. SO I JUST. I'M HOPING. THAT YOU CAN SLOW YOUR ROLL. AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALL HAVE CONCERNS AND THE PROBLEM IS IS WE JUST WENT INTO RECESS AND NOT A LOT OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN WEIGH IN -- TO THIS COMPONENT BUT ANYTIME THAT WE DO LEGISLATION. TO TWO PART OF THIS PROCESS. IT SEEMS TO NOT MAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BUILD THIS RELATIONSHIP -- SOCIALLY TRIP BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A PART OF THE PUBLIC IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. BET AGAIN D. W. OR I THINK THE EXAMPLE IS TOUCH SLOUGH VERSES FOR FIX. YOU KNOW -- IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY DISHEARTENING THAT I SEE -- THAT WERE HERE AND I HAVE TO BE HERE IN -- REPRESENT MY MY CONSTITUENTS BUT I APPRECIATE THE CHEERS -- ABSOLUTELY BEING [inaudible] TRANSPARENT AND UNBIASED THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE OPPORTUNITY I AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER FRASER APPRECIATE YOU WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SENATOR GAL JOHNNY. FOLLOWED BY CITY TO NIELSEN AND THEN WE'LL LOOP TO DOCTOR PANTHER TO GUARANTEE ON I WANT TO THANK SENATOR PAN AND SENATOR MITCHELL FOR ASKING THE QUESTION THAT I WANTED TO PUSH ON AND THAT IS WITH REGARD TO WHETHER THE AMENDMENT BEFORE US. WOULD ALLOW FOR ANY FIND DOLLARS TO GO TOWARD THE WATER FX ITSELF -- I I THINK RATHER THAN ASK IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING I'D LIKE TO SEE THE COMMITTEE REQUIRE THAT YOU COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE. WITH THE F. ANY WATER FIX AMENDMENT. PRIOR TO THAT YOU ACTUALLY ARE WITH THAT WE'RE REQUIRING YOU TO DO SO -- I WISH THAT I WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THIS LAST YEAR TO REQUIRE THAT AND I WILL DO SO NEXT YEAR. I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPERATIVE WE HAVE DONE THAT WITH OTHER -- MAKE A WATER PROJECTS PROJECTS IN GENERAL HIGH SPEED RAIL IF YOU WERE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY YOU WOULD BE COMING BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE BUSINESS PLAN YOU WOULD BE COMING AND MAKING A REQUEST FOR DOLLARS TO BE USED. EVEN KNOW YOUR CONTRACTS ARE WITH -- WITH WATER DISTRICTS ANOTHER PROVIDERS AND THE CONTRACTORS WEEDS ARE STILL USING STATE DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE AND WE'RE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROJECT AS A WHOLE. AND THE SECOND THING THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOU MENTIONED THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN CAN YOU TALK TO US MORE ABOUT THAT AND WHAT THAT IS EXACTLY IS AND AND HOW YOU INSURE WHAT THE DELIVERABLES ARE IN THAT AND WHAT. WHAT THE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE ACTUAL PROJECTS AND WHAT'S THAT LOOK LIKE BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK AS MEMBERS WE SHOULD ALL SEE WE SHOULD BE REVEALING THAT? SO -- THE I'M I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO TO JOEL LEDESMA WHOSE -- MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS ON THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN BUT YOU KNOW THE OVERARCHING MESSAGE FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH IS TRUE OF A LOT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA. ITS ITS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND WATER IN PARTICULAR ALSO SUBJECT -- TO THE CHALLENGES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON TOP OF THAT. AGING INFRASTRUCTURE SO -- THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN IS A DOCUMENT THAT'S BEEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- AND IT WHAT IT IS CENTRALLY DOES IS THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT THAT ARE. COMING TO THE CLOSE OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE OR ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR AND AND REHABILITATION. AND WE ARE VERY MUCH ENTERING INTO AN ERA OF OF REINVESTMENT AND SOME OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO THAT -- IN A TRANSPARENT WAY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF ABILITIES -- THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE WHEN THE STATE WATER PROJECT WAS WAS ORIGINALLY ORIGINALLY BUILT. AND SO THE DEPARTMENT -- UNDER MY LEADERSHIP I THINK IS GOING TO BECOME A LOT MORE TRANSPARENT AS AN ORGANIZATION NOT ONLY WITH THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES WHO YOU KNOW. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY WITH OUR PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE THINGS D. W. R. HAS DONE WELL IN THE ONES WE HAVE NOT DONE WELL -- AND THOSE FOLKS ARE ALSO VERY MUCH ACCOUNTABLE IN AN ELECTED WAY TO THEIR RATE PAYERS. AND SO. IT'S MY VIEW THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE REINVESTMENT THAT IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED -- TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR WATER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS FUNCTIONING AND SUPPORTS NOT ONLY THE ECONOMY BUT ALSO SUPPORTS THE ECOSYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA ANNUAL BASIS AND OPERATE RAJA ACT OUR WAYS IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- HAS ALREADY WEIGHED IN -- AND AND NECESSARILY INAPPROPRIATELY -- TO MAKE THE STATE WATER PROJECT A LITTLE BIT MORE TRANSPARENT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING -- I'D BE GLAD TO PURSUE AND I THINK OUR STATE WATER CONTRACTORS -- WOULD ALSO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF THAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY IN IN AND PARTLY BECAUSE AGAIN THEY'RE ALL ACCOUNTABLE TO CALIFORNIANS IN THE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION RATE PAYERS THAT -- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HAVE REINVEST IN OUR SYSTEM -- ON TO TURN IT OVER TO TO JEWEL MORE SPECIFICALLY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN. GOOD MORNING -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THE DEPARTMENT IS YOU KNOW IN MY VIEW IS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL. OPERATION OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS AND IT'S CREATED YOU KNOW IT'S CREATED A LOT OF BENEFIT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN AN ENGINEER THERE KIND OF SEEING THE FACILITIES WHEN SOME OF WHOM WERE VERY NEW AND KIND OF SEEN THE AGING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS YOU WOULD SAY. AND MY PREDECESSOR ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO YOU KNOW MADE THE COMMITMENT THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE A STRONGER ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM SO WE ALREADY HAD ONE IT'S A COMMON UTILITY PRACTICE TO HAVE AN ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. TO MANAGE THE LIFE AND TO GET THE MOST -- EFFICIENT LIFE OUT OF EVERY ASSET WE OWN. SO HE STARTED A NEW A NEW PROGRAM THAT WAS GOING TO HOLD US TO A HIGHER STANDARD OF ASSET MANAGEMENT SO WE'VE ADOPTED WHAT'S CALLED ISEL FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT AROUND THE WORLD. SO OUR GOAL FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN WEARING YEAR THREE HAS BEEN LET'S UPDATE OUR PROGRAM SO THAT INCORPORATES ALL ASSETS WHETHER THE ROTATING EQUIPMENT LIKE OUR PUMPS OR GENERATORS. OR CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURES LIKE OUR DAMS IN ACADEMICS AND PIPELINES IN BRING THEM ALL IN INTO ONE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. THAT CAN REALLY EVALUATE THE CONDITION. AND THE EXPECTANCY AND THE RISK OF EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT SO THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY MAKE CREATING A FINANCIAL PLAN TO PUT OUR CAPITAL DOLLARS. WHERE RELIABILITY IS MAINTAINED OR ENHANCE BUT ALSO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT RISK INFORMED DECISION MAKING SO WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE PUBLIC? OR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT RISK SO WITH THIS NEW PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO EXTEND FIFTY YEARS OUT. WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE CONDITION OF EVERY ASSET WE HAVE. APPLY RISK TO IT WHETHER IT'S PUBLICRISK RELIABILITY RISK ENVIRONMENTAL RISK COMPLIANCE RISK. AND PUT OUR DOLLARS WHERE WE ARE THEIR BEST APPROPRIATE TO NOT PUT ANY RISK ON THE PROJECT BUT YET. ALLOW THE AFFORDABILITY LIKE WATER AGENCIES IN THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE MONEY WHERE IT'S BEST FIT AND BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND UPDATED AS AS APPROPRIATE. SO IN THIS ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN IT EIGHT CONTAINS THEM ASSETS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE DOES IT HAVE THE ASSETS THAT ARE PROPOSED [inaudible] NO. IS THERE A PLAN TO HAVE THE ASSETS AS OPPOSED. SORRY AND YES AS ASSETS ARE BROUGHT ON LINE OR BUILT OR CONSTRUCTED. THEN THEY'RE PULLED INTO THE ASSET MANAGEMENT IT'S MORE OF A MAINTENANCE PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING WERE DOING THE RIGHT MAINTENANCE ON THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO GET THE LIFE THAT WE EXPECT AUTUMN S THAT PROGRAM WOULD NOT HAVE FUTURE PROJECTS UNTIL THEY'RE CONSTRUCTED IN THEIR ACTUAL ASSETS ON THE BOOKS. SO THERE IS NO MECHANISM. TO BRING TO THE IN THAT THERE IS NO VEHICLE TO BRING TO THE LEGISLATURE PER SE. THAT HAS -- AN OVERALL SUMMARY AND PLAN FOR A NEW ASSETS SUCH AS THE WATER FIX THAT IS PROPOSED. BUT RATHER IT'S IN YOUR INNER WORKINGS AND THERE'S NOT A FORMALIZED PLAN THAT WE HAVE ANY ABILITY TO REVIEW. OR COMMENT ON WELL THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN AS THE WATER PLAN THAT WE UPDATE EVERY FOUR YEARS AND WERE DUE TO RELEASE. A NEW VERSION OF IT AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT YOU KNOW. TAKES AN INVENTORY OF ALL THE HYDROLOGIC REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA -- WATER AVAILABILITY FROM ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOURCES BECAUSE YOU KNOW DUE TO BE OURS IS. IN A BIGGER THAN PROJECT AND THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE WE INTEGRATE -- POTENTIAL NEW PROJECTS -- THAT COULD COME ONLINE -- INCLUDING UNDERGROUND STORAGE ABOVE GROUND STORAGE NEW CONVEYANCE -- OTHER KINDS OF LOCALIZED PROJECTS IT -- DESALINATION. RECYCLED WATER THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES DOES A MUCH BROADER CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL -- THAT OFFERS YOU KNOW POTENTIAL PATHS FOR FOR WATER SECURITY IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WELCOME SIR TO NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY I'VE BEEN A NINE ONE ONE EIGHT MINUTES THIS MORNING. DEALING WITH ACTUALLY VICTIMS OF THAT TRAGEDY. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT HERE. I MUST SAY THAT IT IS OF SOME CONCERN TO ME THAT. THIS IS OCCURRING AFTER THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADJOURNED -- BUT AT LEAST WE'RE GETTING I HAVE AN AN OPPORTUNITY. HERE TO COMMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO COMPLIMENT THE DIRECTOR'S. BUT WE'VE HAD MANY MEETINGS OVER THE MONTHS SINCE HER APPOINTMENT. AND IT APPEARS TO ME SHE'S VERY SINCERE ABOUT REACHING OUT. AND INJURING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. YOU HEARD ME MANY TIMES IN THIS VERY ROOM SAY THAT THERE IS NO TRUST IN THAT DEPARTMENT. ZERO AND IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT IT'S DOUBLE. ZERO BECAUSE OF OUR BILL BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SO FOR THE DEPARTMENT MAKING A GOOD FAITH FAITH EFFORT TO TO WORK WITH US AND YOU DID WORK GO WITH ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER AND I ON SOME DAMN INSPECTION LEGISLATION LAST YEAR. AND ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK RIGHT NOW IS ANOTHER MAJOR TO ALLOW COMMUNITY INPUT. A NOT DIRECTLY IN VOTING AND DOESN'T HAVE POWERS BUT IT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET AND BE INFORMED. AND TO INFORM THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT'S MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I WOULD ITERATE FROM MY OWN PERSPECTIVE THAT INDEED THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT WATER FIX. AND WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO. AND WHAT ITS FUTURE IN FACT WILL BE. pWHAT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THOUGH? THERE MUST BE. VERY STRICT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF EVERYTHING THAT IS DONE. THE OVERRUNS ON OR REAL RIGHT NOW FRANKLY ARE OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME. NOW I KNOW WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS SAID ABOUT. THOSE OVER RUNS AND WHY. BUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE JUSTIFICATIONS. OUR PRESENT DAY ARE THE PRODUCT OF FIFTY YEARS OF NEGLECT. AND THE GREATEST NEGLECT WAS THE LACK OF BORING OR UNDERGROUND. EXPLORATION AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE SPELL WORKS N. INATTENTION TO FIXING. THOSE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY EXPLODED INTO THIS NEAR DISASTER THAT WE JUST EXPERIENCED. THAT THEN EMPHASIZES THE POINT THAT ON I SAY ALL INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS MUCH MORE SCRUTINY. AND MANAGEMENT BY THE LEGISLATURE [inaudible] SUCH PROJECTS. UNDER THE AUTHORITY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES MOST ASSUREDLY DO. AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE NOT ONLY IS THE FIXING IF YOU WILL. OF THE DAM [inaudible] ORVILLE DAMN. BUT REPAIR MAINTENANCE OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THAT INCLUDES THE LEVEES IN THE BY PASSES THAT CONVEY. AND IN FACT THE DELTA ITSELF. WHICH BY THE WAY THEY THROUGH DELTA FACILITY IS A POSSIBILITY. THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE. BY THE RED TUNNEL. OR CAN NOW. I WOULD HOPE THAT WOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND. AS WE LOOK AHEAD. THE NOW TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE. SPECIFIC. IS THIS HEARING NOW BEING CONSTITUTED AS A FINAL -- LEGAL. REQUIREMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO PROCEED. WITH WATER FIX I THINK I HEARD THAT SAID BUT I CAME IN LATE. I WANT TO BE VERY SURE ABOUT THAT IF IF I CAN REPLY PLEASE MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE I OPENED WITH MAKING THE CLARIFICATION SO LET ME JUST STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT. WATER CODE SECTION ONE FOUR POINT SEVEN REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO PRESENT IN THE RENEWALS AND EXTENSIONS OF A LONG TERM WATER SUPPLY CONTRACTS. TO AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND SO WHILE WE'VE TALKED. MANY PEOPLE THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT WATER FIX OWN RESPONSIBILITY HERE TODAY. IT'S TWO HERE AND ASK QUESTIONS OF THE PROPOSED. CURRENT CONTRACT AMENDMENTS UNDERSTAND OKAY. WELL THAT DOES IT COMPORT WITH MY UNDERSTANDING. AND THEN A MY THEN OFFERING AS WE PROCEED. IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT ROLE THE SENATE IN ITS COMMITTEES THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THOUGH THE CASE SHOULD BE THE RESOURCES COMMITTEE AFFECTING THIS AREA. HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. AND IT WOULD BE MY INTENT. TO SEE THAT. IF ANYTHING STEP UP. AS WE PROCEED SO WE DON'T GET DRIFTING OFF. ON THE SIDE TRACK HERE OR GET DIFFERENT AGENDAS. THERE'S ALSO CONCERN BECAUSE IT WAS MENTIONED THE WATER COMMISSION AND THE WATER BOARD. CERN'S ABOUT THOSE PARTICULAR ENTITIES THEMSELVES GOING QUOTE THEIR OWN WAY. AND I'VE HAD MANY CONCERNS AND OBJECTIONS AND VERBAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR -- PHENOMENA IN GOVERNMENT -- WITH THAT KIND OF A SOLILOQUY -- DIRECTED THEM WITH. WHAT WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SAY TO ME TO GIVE ME COMFORT? THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A COMPLETE HUGE OVER RUN. THE CONTROLS ARE GOING TO BE IN PLACE. THE THINGS THAT ARE PROPOSED -- THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF EFFICACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU SENATOR -- ID EXPECT THAT YOUR YOUR QUESTION IS RELATED TO WATER FIX -- RELATED TO ACCOUNTABILITY COST SO -- WELL THE FIXING OF WAR BILL TO THAT'S FAR FROM DONE AND THE CONVEYANCES. TO SO -- SO WELL MAYBE I'LL START WITH OR THEY'LL -- YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW AND I I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN IN SOME DIALOGUE WITH YOU AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER ON THE THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WE MOST RECENTLY REPORTED -- IN A LARGELY DUE TO A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THAT. WE ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY DESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTING -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PUBLIC SAFETY DEMANDS -- WE WILL AS A AS AN OUTCOME OF THE COMP OR THE COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT -- UP IT OR THEY'LL WHICH WILL DESCRIBE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE FACILITY NECESSARY INTO THE FUTURE. TO MAKE SURE WE MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST RE OF PUBLIC SAFETY -- THAT THAT WILL HAVE ITS OWN PROJECTS AND THOSE PROJECTS WILL BE ONES THAT WOULD BE -- DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED AS PART OF THIS ACT -- IN TERMS OF THE COST FACTOR ON THOSE PROJECTS THEY HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE IN THOSE WE WOULD YOU KNOW EFFECTIVELY HAVE THE LUXURY OF OF DESIGNING AND REVIEWING THOSE DESIGNS AND MUCH GREATER DEGREE OF OF MANAGEMENT OVER TIME AS THOSE. AS THOSE KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE -- AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE DEPARTMENT -- WOULD DO SO IN THE CONTEXT OF A BROADER -- SUITE OF TRANSPARENCY KINDS OF ISSUES -- WE NEED TO ADDRESS AS IT RELATES -- TO YOU KNOW. THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS DORAVILLE BUT ALSO ANY NEW KIND OF PROJECT THAT COMES ON LINE -- AND ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE WOULD DO SO IS -- IS DISCLOSING ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS -- WHERE WE ARE WITH OUR -- WHERE WE ARE IS OUR COSTS AND -- AS IT PERTAINS TO THE TO THE WATER FIX IN PARTICULAR -- WE DO HAVE COST ESTIMATES OUT THERE -- THEY DO HAVE A 37% CONTINGENCY -- TUNNEL PROJECTS -- TECHNICALLY HAVE A A MORE DEGREE A HIGHER DEGREE OF OF COST UNCERTAINTY AND THAT'S WHY THE INTO THE THE COSTS AS DESCRIBED -- ADMIN ITSELF -- THROUGH -- MR LEDESMA'S LEADERSHIP IS -- IS I THINK MAKING SOME IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS IN TERMS OF BRINGING ON A CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER THAT WOULD BE A NEW POSITION AT THE DEPARTMENT IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL -- FOR HOW WE MANAGE THE STATE WATER PROJECT'S FINANCES SO THAT -- THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES WHO -- WHO ESSENTIALLY PAY FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAS IMPORTANT -- OVERSIGHT AND AN INTEREST IN IN THAT UTILITY RUNNING AS COST EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE THAT THAT FOLKS HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND WE'RE DOING JUST A MUCH BETTER JOB AT PROACTIVELY COMMUNICATING WHAT THE INVESTMENTS IN TAIL AND AND WHY THEY'RE NECESSARY. I THANK YOU FOR THAT. LET ME JUST ANOTHER FOLLOW UP THEN. THIS WOULD RELATE TO THE UTILIZATION OF THE PROP ONE BOND MONEY. THE WATER COMMISSION HAS JUST MADE SOME DECISIONS [inaudible] ABOUT THAT. TO WHAT DEGREE WILL THEN NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ENGAGE. BUT NOW I'M SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO SITES RESERVOIR. THEN THE HAVE BEEN ACCORD CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEY ARE. SEEKING OTHER REVENUE SOURCES. BUT HOW AND WHEN WILL THE DEPARTMENT NOW ENGAGED IN THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT. WELL WE WOULD ENGAGE IN IN MULTIPLE WAYS -- AND AND PROJECTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED STORAGE PROJECTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY PROPOSITION. ONE AND AS YOU KNOW THE WATER COMMISSION THERE -- THEIR DECISION WAS TO EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISH A MAXIMUM ELIGIBILITY. FOR A PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT -- WOULD BE FOCUSED ON PUBLIC BENEFITS AS DESCRIBED. AS DESCRIBED IN THE LAW AND AND WHAT THAT ENTAILS FOR THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE A SPECIFIC ROLE AND HAD A SPECIFIC ROLE IN FRONT OF THE WATER COMMISSION -- TO ESTABLISH -- A MONETARY VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH -- RECREATIONAL -- POTENTIAL ITS EMERGENCY RESPONSE BENEFITS AND FLOOD KIND OF FITS SO ANY -- WATER PROJECT -- THAT HAS RECEIVED OUR STORAGE PROJECT THAT HAS RECEIVED PROP ONE DOLLARS OR WOULD IS IN ANTICIPATION OF RECEIVING PROP ONE DOLLARS -- THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ENGAGE WITH THOSE PARTIES WHO ARE THE PROJECT SPONSORS -- AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT -- SUCH THAT AS THE PROJECT IS DESIGNED AND OPERATED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BEIN RECEIPT OF THOSE KINDS OF BENEFITS THE RECREATIONAL THE FLOOD CONTROL IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. SITES RESERVOIR OF COURSE -- IS -- HAS AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT -- IN PARTICULAR -- THAT RELATES TO THE POTENTIAL INTEREST OF STATE WATER CONTRACTORS INDIVIDUAL STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AND BUYING INTO THAT PROJECT -- AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES -- SHOULD THAT PROJECT PROCEED QUITE A BIT OF WORK FIND MORE FOR THAT PROJECT IS IN THE FINANCING PARTNERS. BUT SHOULD THAT PROJECT -- PRECEDE THE DEPARTMENT WOULD -- NEED TO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH THOSE INTERESTED STATE WATER CONTRACTORS -- TO ESTABLISH -- THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL MECHANISMS -- FOR MOVING WATER STORED IN SITES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. SOUTH OF THE DELTA AND THAT WOULD ENTAIL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OF DISCUSSION AND AND LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS TO TO ENABLE THAT INVESTMENT TO HAPPEN. AND AS YOU ACCOUNT FOR THIS. YOU MENTIONED CERTAIN CRITERIA IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA HUMAN. USE OF WATER. WHICH BE DAGGER CULTURAL USE DOMESTIC INDUSTRIAL USE OF WATER. WHILE I WOULD ANTICIPATE -- I DIDN'T HEAR THAT SAID AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THERE'S THE HUMAN WATER RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT SO SO WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO SIR WAS THE THE SPECIFIC PUBLIC BENEFITS. ALL THE STORAGE PROJECTS -- THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BUILDING BE BUILT THAT WOULD HAVE A A LOCAL FINANCING COMPONENT SOME OF THEM COULD HAVE A FEDERAL FUNDING COMPONENT. AND THOSE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE -- NEEDS AND GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO PROVIDING CLEAN WATER TO TO FARMS IN COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO WHAT DEGREE. ARE YOU GUIDED BY THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE LEGISLATION. THE CAPE BROUGHT FORTH THE NEW WATER PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA YOU MENTION THE WATER PLANT AWHILE AGO IS THAT THE WATER PLAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UPDATING. I KNOW THAT WAS A SEPARATE UNDER THE WATER CODE AND CALIFORNIA'S D. W. R. AS REQUIRED TO PUT A PLAN TOGETHER EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO OUR LAST ONE WOULD HAVE COME OUT IN -- TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THIS IS THE FIVE YEAR UPDATE OF THAT OF THAT WATER PLANT I SEE. THOUGH DO YOU FEEL. GUIDE INDEED REQUIRED TO BE GUIDED BY AN AD HERE. TO THE WATER PLANT OF NINE THOUGH THE FOUND FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THAT WATER PLAN OF NINE IS THAT GOING TO BE ALSO RECTOR MAC MOST CERTAINLY YES OKAY THANK. YOU I I DID A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE LEDGE ANALYSTS. ANALYSTS DO YOU BELIEVE THE YOU'RE SO FAR AND I'VE. REVIEWED YOUR DOCUMENTS. CARDS ARE THERE ENOUGH CONTROLS. OF THE LEGISLATURE. AS WE PROCEED FORWARD. EXPANDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. HOURS ARE GOING TO BE OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE. ARE ACTUALLY I THINK WE HAVE LONG RECOMMENDED -- THAT AN IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE ROLE FOR OVERSIGHT OVER THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONS TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT OR EXISTING ONE EXAMPLE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AS WE'VE RECOMMENDED. I BRING THE PROJECT ON BUDGET RATHER THAN HAVING THE FUNDING BE CONTINUOUSLY PERFORATED SO THAT THERE'S AN ANNUAL CHECK IN THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PROCESS ON EXPENDITURES AND AND FUNDING SO THAT'S ONE AVENUE BUT CERTAINLY GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF NOT ONLY THE DOLLARS IN THEIR PUBLIC DOLLARS COMING. FROM THE PUBLIC THROUGH PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES BEING SPENT BUT ALSO THE IMPORTANCE TO THE VITALITY OF CALIFORNIA THE WATER THAT -- IT'S-IMPORTANT THAT THAT YOU ALL AS AN ELECTED BODY HAVE SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT AND SO LOOKING FOR AVENUES TO INCREASE THAT WE THINK IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA YOU'VE STILL THAT ROUTE. WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION OR DO YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS NOW SUFFICIENTLY WITH IT'S POWERS. EMPOWERED. TO EXERCISE CERTAINLY YOU HAVE. RIGHT A BIT OF OF OPPORTUNITY THROUGH OVERSIGHT HEARINGS THAT YOU COULD EXERCISE MORE GREATLY THAN YOU CURRENTLY DO BUT I'M AT THINGS LIKE CHANGING THE BUDGETARY PRACTICES OR REQUIRING CERTAIN REPORTS COMING TO YOU WOULD REQUIRE STATUTORY CHANGES. AND WE STILL HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER THE BUDGET ITSELF DO WE NOT. THROUGH POSITIONS THAT'S REALLY THE THE PEACE THAT COMES BEFORE YOU EACH YEAR IS HOW MANY IF THEY ARE REQUESTING NEW POSITIONS OF STATE EMPLOYEES THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE NEXUS OF THIS POINT. LOOK WHAT. LET LET LET ME GET TO SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC I MENTIONED AWHILE AGO GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE COSTS OF WAR WILL HAVE EXPLODED. NOW I UNDERSTAND PART OF THE REASON FOR THE FAILURES F THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IN THERE HAPPEN TO MAKE UP FOR THAT. AND WHATEVER YOU DO NOW IS ON A NEW BASIS AND WITH NEW STANDARDS BUT DO WE HAVE AN ABILITY. TO PREVENT SUCH THINGS AS WHAT HAPPENED OR WILL HE END THIS OVER RUN THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW. FOR THAT THAT FROM HAPPENING GOING FORWARD. YEAH AND I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE CLARIFIED YOU DO HAVE A LARGE PIECE OF DATA WE OURS BUDGET THAT COMES BEFORE YOU WERE YOU'RE JUST NOT THE STATE WATER PROJECT THAT'S THE PIECE THAT'S CONTINUOUSLY PURPOSE OF THEIR DAMN INSPECTIONS BUDGET AND THERE WAS ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROVIDED AND AND REQUIREMENTS. I GUESS ACTUALLY SOME FUNDING AND ALSO AUTHORITY -- TO CHARGE DAM OWNERS ADDITIONAL FEES TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR WORK SO -- THERE ARE CERTAINLY AVENUES OF D. TO BE OURS BUDGET THAT DO COME BEFORE YOU BUT THAT THAT FUNDING FROM THE STATE WATER PROJECT TO SUPPORT SEA WATER PROJECT ACTIVITIES TYPICALLY ARE THE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED PIECE WELL IN THIS BUDGET I THINK WE MADE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN TERMS OF SOME. REHABILITATION. OF THE CONVO THE MANAGER THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE SENATOR NELSON WE'RE GOING TO CIRCLE BACK TO DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE DOES I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY -- THE THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER SO I SELF JUST TO BE CLEAR SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ART CHAIR HAS ARTICULATED. ONE PIECE THAT YOU WILL BE LOWER THAN WHAT THE WATER FIXES WITH A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OF COURSE YOU'RE ABLE TO FINANCE OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OKAY GOT THAT. THERE IS. THEN YOU'RE WORKING ON A SEPARATE SET OF WATER FIX AMENDMENTS THAT. I HEARD THAT WE WILL HOPEFULLY BE DISCUSSING -- PRIOR TO THEIR APPROVAL -- THE LEGISLATURE BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER MINNESOTA SIDE FROM EXTENDING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE LENGTH OF YOUR FINANCING YOURBONDS THAT. THAT ACTUALLY CHANGED OUT THIS AMENDMENT BASICALLY. ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT ISSUE BONDS IN CHARGE CONSTRUCTORS FOR THE FINANCING COSTS OF REPAIRS IN CAPITAL PROJECTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FACILITIES RESISTANCE PRIOR TO JUNE FIRST NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH IS A CURRENT CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS SO THAT REQUIREMENTS BEEN CHANGED SO NOW THERE'S NO DATE. AND TO FINANCE OTHER CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT ALREADY LISTED IN THE CONTRACT IF THE DEPARTMENT LEAST 80% EFFECTIVE CONTRACTORS AGREE WHICH BASICALLY MEANS LOTS A PRISON THE CONTRACTORS AND THE DEPARTMENT SAVE. FINE WE CAN FINANCE ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE EXISTING CONTRACTS. SO MY QUESTION IS WILL THIS PROVISION THIS CHANGE IN THE CONTRACTS. B. E. IS OUR WILL YOU CAN YOU ASSURE US THAT THIS PROVISION WILL NOT BE USED SO THIS IS A SITE FROM LET'S SAY BE ABLE TO DO A THIRTY YEAR BOND VERSES SEVENTEEN YEAR BOND THAT THIS PROVISION WILL NOT BE USED. FOR THE WATER EFFECTS IN OTHER WORDS BECAUSE ACTUALLY YOU BASED ON THE LEASE WHAT I READ HERE 80% THE CONTRACTORS AND YOU SAY. HEY WE'RE GOOD WE'VE GOT FLIPPED HIS BOND GO BUILD SOMETHING YOU COULD BUILD SOMETHING WHATEVER IT IS SO CAN YOU ASSURE ME THAT THIS PROVISION WILL NOT BE USED AT THE I GOT IF YOU WORK ON SOME WATER FIX AMENDMENTS MAY HAVE pCETERA. BUT THAT THIS PROVISION WILL NOT BE USED IN AND AND AND AND AND AND AND FINANCE -- PROJECTS THAT BABY OBJECTED BY A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF PEOPLE CALIFORNIA CORRECT NAME WITH BEFORE YOU ANSWER YOU CLEAR WITH THE QUESTION IS I AM CLEAR THINKING OKAY. TO MAKE SURE. THIRD ROUND OF CLARIFICATION ALRIGHT [inaudible] YES YES. I I WILL BE USED KNOW IT WHAT CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT IT SAYS RIGHT. CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT THIS AMENDMENT WILL NOT HE USES OKAY I'M SAYING GAS IT WILL NOT BE USED FOR THE WATER FIX OKAY I JUST WANNA BE VERY CLEAR ON THAT OKAY THANK YOU. THIS IS A ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I I IN IN HEARING -- DIRECTOR NAMES BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO HEARING FROM CONTRACTORS WHO WILL BE THE NEXT THE FOCUS OF THE NEXT PANEL -- I THINK I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS IN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE HEARD. MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE MISTER FREEZE REPRESENTING THE ASSEMBLY TODAY -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE IN THIS INCIDENT. EXPRESS A REAL DESIRE TO BE ENGAGED -- BEYOND THE POINT OF TODAY'S HEARING WHICH IS TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT CONTRACT A MINUTE BEFORE US BUT TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION AROUND WATER FIX. AND SO -- AS CHAIR THE JAIL BC WE WILL ENGAGE WITH YOU IN YOUR DEPARTMENT. TO HOPEFULLY COME TO SOME AGREEMENT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM YOU. ON BEAT THE GL BC OR OTHER -- INSISTS HE WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE PRIOR TO THE FINALIZATION OF THE WATER FIX AMENDMENT. GREAT. WITH THAT LET ME INVITE THE THIRD PANEL WE'RE GOING TO ASK -- THE DIRECT YOU TO STAY. IF YOU DON'T MIND -- WE'LL ASK YOU TO GERMAN PLEASE IF YOU DON'T MIND TO MAKE SPACE AT THE TABLE THE THIRD ON THE FRONT ROW THERE IN CASE WE NEED -- TO TAP INTO YOUR EXPERTISE ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WE'RE GOING TO ASK. CONTRACT REPRESENTATIVES TO STEP FORWARD ROM BOTH METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT. AND THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICT ZONE. SEVEN AND A WHEEL ALIGNMENT INTRODUCED HIMSELF [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. SEVEN PRONOUNCE YOUR LAST NAME FOR ME. IT'S A PARTY A BOOKING FEE I WOULD'VE GOTTEN THAT RIGHT I'M GLAD I ASKED WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM MR POTTY A FIRST REPRESENTING AGAIN THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR MITCHELL AND GOOD AFTERNOON -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DEVIN A POTTY -- AND I'M THE ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. METROPOLITAN IS A STATE ESTABLISH COOPERATIVE OF TWENTY SIX CITIES AND WATER AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE DRINKING WATER TO APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE AND SIX SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. METROPOLITAN IMPORTS WATER FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE COLORADO RIVER TO SUPPLEMENT LOCAL SUPPLIES. AND WE HOLD A LONG TERM CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FOR PARTICIPATION RATES IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT. TODAY ALL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHY IT'S NECESSARY TO EXTEND THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTORS TO ENSURE RELIABLE SUPPLY TO ABOUT TWENTY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION HERE A GATED ACRES. MY TESTIMONY FOCUSES ON THE ISSUES RELATED TO D. W. OURS ABILITY TO ISSUE REVENUE BONDS TO SMOOTH THE STATE THROUGH THE STATE WATER POJECT COSTS. COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE FINANCING COMPRESSION ISSUES. PRIOR WILL BE PROVIDING TESTIMONY ABOUT CONTRACT LANGUAGE THAT IMPROVES THE FINANCIAL INTEGRITY OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO US AS PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. FOR OVER TEN YEARS THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THE CONTRACT WITH D. W. R. HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEED TO EXTEND THE LONG TERM WATER SUPPLY CONTRACTS. TO ALLOW D. W. R. TO ISSUE BONDS BEYOND. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TO ACHIEVE THIS DID YOU ARE AND THE PWA IS ENGAGED IN TWENTY THREE PUBLIC NEGOTIATING SESSIONS SPANNING FROM MAY OF TWENTY THIRTEEN THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY FOURTEEN ALTERNATELY RESULTING IN AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE. D. W. R. THEN RELEASED A DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO AT THIS POINT THE SECRET PROCESS IS NEARLY COMPLETE. AND THE AGREEMENT OF PRINCIPLES BEEN CONVERTED INTO THE CONTRACT LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY. EVEN WITHOUT CONSIDERING CALIFORNIA WATER FIX OR THE ORVILLE SPILL WAY REPAIRS. THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES HAVE PROJECTED THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE D. W. R. WILL NEED TO INVEST SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND A HALF AND THREE BILLION DOLLARS. TO REPLACE AND REPAIR AND AGING SO THIS IS SIMPLY THE NORMAL UPKEEP OF THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS SERVING ROUGHLY TWENTY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS. EXAMPLES OF THIS KIND OF WORK INCLUDE REFURBISHING AND REPLACING PUMPS AT THE ADMIN SIM PUMPING FACILITY. GW OURS DELTA COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. SEISMIC UPGRADES TO CISCO DAMN AT ST LOUIS RESERVOIR AND FIRE SYSTEM UPGRADES. AT FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WATER PROJECT. UNFORTUNATELY IN CARRYING OUT THIS IMPORTANT WORK D. W. R. ISN'T ABLE TO USE THE FINANCIAL TOOLS THE TYPICAL MODERN UTILITIES WOULD USE. THEIR CONSTRAINED TO ISSUING BONDS THE ONLY FINANCE THESE FACILITIES. TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE RIGHT NOW THAT MEANS YOU'RE ONLY ABLE TO ISSUE BONDS FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS WHEN THIRTY YEARS OR POSSIBLY FORTY YEAR BONDS WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE. THIS CREATES A SERIOUS COST COMPRESSION ISSUE FOR US IS WATER AGENCIES AND ONLY SERVES TO ARTIFICIALLY DRIVE UP THE WATER RATES FOR MILLIONS OF LOCAL RATEPAYERS. TO DEMONSTRATE THE FINANCIAL COMPRESSION ISSUE WE PROVIDED A HAND OUT WITH GRAPHICS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN REFERRING TO HAND OUT THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS. THE FIGURES IN THIS HANDOUT SHOW HOW CAPITAL CHARGES WILL INCREASE. AT REMARKABLE RATES FOR MUNICIPAL INDUSTRIAL AGENCIES AND AGRICULTURAL AGENCIES IF THE CONTRACT ISN'T EXTENDED. THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THESE FACILITIES WHICH WOULD LAST FOR MANY YEARS BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE HAVE TO BE PAID IN AN EVER SHRINKING PERIOD OF TIME. THE GRAPHICS ALSO SHOW HOW THE ANNUAL COST WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. BY SIMPLY EXTENDING THE CONTRACT THUS ALLOWING D. W. R. USE BOND RATIONS THAT ARE MORE CONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS. THIS AMENDMENT WOULD EXTEND THE STATE WATER CONTRACT AND ALLOWED YOU TO YOUR TO IMPLEMENT BILLING PROVISIONS CONSISTENT WITH MODERN UTILITY BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THESE THINGS WOULD REDUCE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS AND HELP MAINTAIN THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A COLLEGE WHEN WE HEAR FROM BOTH PANELS BEFORE WE OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS -- SO MISS PRIOR WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VALERIE PRIOR AND I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICT ZONE. SEVEN WE ARE LOCATED IN EASTERN ALAMEDA CAN PROVIDE WATER FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN LIVERMORE DUBLIN PLEASANTON AND SAN RAMON AND WE ALSO SERVE AGRICULTURAL CUSTOMERS. I AM GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE AMENDMENTS RELATED TO D. W. R. STATE WATER PROJECT FINANCIAL INTEGRITY AS A LARGE PUBLIC UTILITY WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. DID OF YOURS RESERVE LEVELS ARE SET IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN ANNUAL REVENUES AVERAGE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO INCREASE THE RESERVE LEVEL FROM THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. REFLECTS MORE APPROPRIATE RESERVE LEVEL FOR A SIX BILLION DOLLAR WATER UTILITY WITH ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE. MANY UTILITIES MAINTAIN OPERATING RESERVES OF APPROXIMATELY 25% OF OPERATING EXPENDITURES FOR EMERGENCY IN CAPITAL AND THIS PROPOSED AMOUNT FOR D. W. R. IS MORE IN LINE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICES ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE A BIT LESS AN INDUSTRY PRACTICES. NEW RESERVE FUNDS THEY'RE CLEARLY DEFINED AS TO THE USE AND PURPOSE FOR EACH ONE OF THE FUN SO THIS PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY TO THE PUBLIC AND THE RATE PAYERS. THE NEW RESERVE FUNDS WILL PROVIDE THE STATE WATER PROJECT FINANCIAL STABILITY AND TIMES OF OPERATIONAL EMERGENCY AND THIS AGAIN PROVIDES RATE STABILITY FOR THE RATE PAYERS. THE NEW RESERVE FUNDS WILL ALSO HELP MAINTAIN HIGH BOND RATINGS WHICH KEEP INTEREST COSTS LOW AND AGAIN LEAD TO COST SAVINGS FOR THE RATE PAYERS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS A DISCUSSION ABOUT -- AMENDING ARTICLE ONE H. H. OF THE CURRENT CONTRACT IN LEADING UP TO THIS HEARING THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION OVER THE PURPOSE OF THE MODIFICATION. TO ARTICLE ONE H. H. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS PROVISION DOES NOT ADDRESS THE FINANCING OR COST ALLOCATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER FIX WHICH AS WE DISCUSS WILL BE A SEPARATE CONTRACT AMENDMENT. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTS ONE H. H. SPECIFICALLY LISTS WHAT CAN BE CAPITALIZED AND DOES NOT INCLUDE MORE MODERN PROJECTS SUCH AS SKATER OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OR NEWER IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM. ANY ITEMS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS ARTICLE WHICH WAS WRITTEN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE TO BE CASH FINANCE WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A MORE. EXPENSIVE MEANS OF FINANCING LONG TERM CAPITAL ASSETS THIS UPDATED LANGUAGE WILL ALLOW D. W. R. TO DEBT FINANCE THESE INVESTMENTS AS LONG AS OUR GENERAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE CONTRACTORS WHO WOULD PAY FOR THESE IMPROVEMENTS. AGAIN THESE WOULD INCLUDE ITEMS THAT WERE NOT LISTED IN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T CONTEMPLATED AT THAT TIME SUCH AS STATUS SYSTEMS -- MORE MODERN COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS MORE MODERN SOFTWARE SYSTEMS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT -- WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EXTENDING THE CON FOR MULTIPLE YEARS LONGER THAN THIRTY YEARS IN THE USE OF THIRTY YEAR BONDS. THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAS LONGER LIVES THAN THIRTY YEARS -- IT CAN BE COMMON FOR PUMP STATIONS TO HAVE FIFTY OR FORTY YOUR LIVES PIPELINES CAN HAVE FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE YOUR LIVES SO IN DEVELOPING. THE FIFTY YEAR ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR D. W. ARE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT ISSUING. YOU KNOW THIRTY OR FORTY YEAR BONDS AND MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE PLANNING INTERVAL SO THAT WOULD PROVIDE BETTER FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY. FOR THE RATE PAYERS IT WOULD BE PAYING FOR THESE COSTS. THESE AMENDMENTS TO THE JUST THE BILLING PROBLEM PROVISIONS WILL PROVIDE STABLE RATES AND CHARGES FOR THE TWENTY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT WILL SERVE. THE STABILITY WILL HELP US AS A PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES AND OUR FINANCIAL PLANNING AND THAT WILL HELP US PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO OUR RATE PAYERS. THE MINUTES ALSO PROVIDE ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY TO THE PUBLIC AND THE RATE PAYERS AND THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES BY CREATING THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER -- OFFICER POSITION AND ALSO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE THAT WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN ON POLICY LEVEL ITEMS. FINALLY LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE CHANGES TO THE BILLING PROCESS WHICH WILL BE EASIER FOR DATE OF YOUR TO ADMINISTER EASIER FOR D. W. ON THE CONTRACTORS TO UNDERSTAND. AND WILL ALIGN COST RECOVERY WHICH WITH WITH WHEN THE CHARGES ARE ANCHORED WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES TO PROTECT THEIR RATE PAYERS. AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN. THE PREVIOUS HEARING WAS DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF OF CONTRACTORS PERHAPS DOING THIS LONG TERM FINANCING ON OUR OWN. AND WE DON'T THINK COULD BE FEASIBLE FOR ALL CONTRACTORS TO DO TAT NOT ALL CONTRACTORS HAVE ACCESS TO LONG TERM BOND MARKETS NOR THE FINANCE STAFF TO ADMINISTER LONG TERM FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY SEPARATE LONG TERM FINANCING TRACKS TRANSACTIONS WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY INEFFICIENT AND WOULD INCREASE THE OVERALL COSTS WHICH WOULD THEN INCREASE THE COST TO THE RATE PAYERS. OF THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY HE VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA START WITH SEVEN TWO NELSON AND MOVE ON TO SET A PANTHER GINNY ALSO. WITH THE BOTH OF YOU BE ABLE TO REPRESENT. THAT YOU SPEAK FOR OF ALL THE WATER CONTRACTORS NORTH AND SOUTH CENTRAL. TO CALIFORNIA THE REMARKS YOU'RE MAKING THEM SEE MORE FLEXIBLE TO YOUR OWN AUTHORITIES. BUT DO YOU SPEAK FOR THE REST OF THE WATER CONTRACTORS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. OR WHO SPEAKS FOR THEM. SO. I CAN CERTAINLY SPEAK FOR METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT -- AS IT RELATES TO THE CONTRACT EXTENSION I BELIEVE ALL OF THE TWENTY NINE CONTRACTORS ON BOARD IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE EXTENSION. YES I WOULD CONCUR -- THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AS A WHOLE SUPPORT THIS EXTENSION OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE SEE FOLKS SHAKING THEIR HEADS IN THE AUDIENCE AND YOU CAN FEEL FREE DURING PUBLIC COMMENT TO SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE IF YOU SO DESIRE [inaudible] WELL [inaudible] RIGHT. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE DEGREE TO WHICH YOU REPRESENT ALL THOSE OUT THERE SO WE'LL SEE IF THEY WANT TO COME FORWARD THEY'LL COME FORWARD THAT. I THINK THAT'S THE POINT THAT'LL THANK YOU SIR THIRTY GRAND. THANK YOU AND I DID IT FOR SO I JUST ONE THING DIRECT NAME IT'S FOR YOUR PREVIOUS COMMITMENT -- BECAUSE I I DO THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL WE WANNA CHIEF THE AIMS WHICH WERE -- THAT PRESENT AND DISCUSS I MEAN I THINK THE YOUNG WE'RE NOT. WE DON'T WANT TO RAISE COSTS ON WATER USERS AND AND CONTRACTORS RIGHT WE WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO DO CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WE WHAT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED OVER THE PAST YEARS IT CETERA. BUT I DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS GOES BACK PARENTS SEE -- AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. THAT THEIR SIDE THAT THAT TRUST IS BUILT AND I THINK THAT -- THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW LEVEL HOW MUCH FREQUENT OVERSIGHT BROUGHT AND EVEN THE LENGTH OF THE HOW LONG YOU ARE MAKING GO OUT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S BASICALLY YOU CAN'T DIVE DOWN AND YOU'RE DOING STUFF AND THEN YOU POP UP EVERY YOU KNOW COUPLE DECADES. OR PEOPLE ARE WORRIED THAT YOU GOT TO GET THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR FARMS AND THEIR THEIR THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR PROPERTY IT CETERA. AND THAT AND THAT -- PEOPLE WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT -- IT'S ALL TOO LATE -- TO WHAT WE SIGNED ALL THE CONTRACTS AND WE HAVE ALL THE COMMITMENTS WE FOLLOW THE BONDS THAT CREATES A LOT OF DISTRUST SO -- I APPRECIATE THAT -- HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO ALLOW YOU TO GO FORWARD -- I APPRECIATE DIRECTORS COULD -- YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID I THINK AGAIN WHAT TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS IS WE DON'T SIT THERE AND MICRO MANAGE EVERY LITTLE EXPENDITURE RIGHT AND THAT IT'S BETTER. BUT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT IF SOMETHING IS OUT OF THE NORM OF FEATURE NORMAL OPERATIONS ARE NORMAL CAPITAL. AND THAT'S GONNA START AFFECTING A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT GREAT -- BUT HAVING YOU COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USES THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT YEAH THAT SOUNDS GOOD GO AND DO THAT SO BEGAN TRANSPARENCIES AND BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND AND THE BUILDING THAT TRUST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEN THAT YES. FROM ANIME IF WE'RE WINDING DOWN MADAM CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO THINK AGAIN DIRECTOR NUMBERS SHE HAS REACHED OUT AND I HAVE. VERY MUCH VALUE TO OUR PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS AND YOUR ACCESS AND RESPONSIVE TO ME THUS FAR. THANK. WERE FAR FROM WINDING DOWN SIR WE HAVE ONE MORE PANEL AND PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS PAM -- WE'RE GONNA INVITE -- ROGER MOORE -- WHO IS AN ADVOCATE? TO PRESENT HIS PERSPECTIVE THE COMMITTEE EIGHT OF YOUR LETTER. THANK YOU AND WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M ROGER MOORE AND BY THE WAY I I PROVIDED TWO LETTERS ONE WAS PREPARED. FOR THE PREVIOUS. HEARING. FROM. I HAVE GONE WAY BACK WITH THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND REALLY WANT TO SEE IT BRING OUT ITS BEST WHICH WILL REQUIRE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- I MY INVOLVEMENT ON STATE WATER PROJECT ISSUES GOES BACK MORE THAN TWO DECADES. FLYING COLLUDING LITIGATION IN LATER NEGOTIATION ON THE MONORAIL AMENDMENTS WHICH BY THE WAY IS THE SOURCE OF THE REQUIREMENT D. W. ARE FINALLY COMMITTED TO TO ALLOW PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. BY IN STATE WATER CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS ON I AM HERE REALLY HOPING TO NOT HAVE TO SPEND THE NEXT TWO DECADES -- BY TRYING TO DECIPHER WHAT THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACT MEANS -- WE ALL HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO BUT I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE DELTA CAUCUS ACT APPELLEE REFERRED TO AS THE FOG OF COMPLEXITY SPELL SOME EXAMPLES OF WHICH WE HAVE SEEN THIS MORNING. SO I WILL BE ADDED IN BACK AS MANY TIMES AS IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE THAT FULL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACCOMPANIES THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH WILL BRING OUT ITS BASS -- IN -- RECENT -- ON MATTERS RELATING TO THE EIGHT PUBLIC AGENCIES IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY AND THE DELTA COUNTIES -- IN THE CURRENT VALIDATION ACTION D. W. R. BROUGHT ON WATER FIX REVENUE BONDS I HAVE FOUR YEARS REPRESENTED -- BUTTE COUNTY IN. MATTERS RELATING TO OR THEY'LL DAM AND BY THE WAY I SHOULD POINT OUT I TAKE STRONG EXCEPTION TO THE NOTION THAT ALL TWENTY NINE WATER CONTRACTORS -- HAVE ENDORSED THE CONTRACT EXTENSION THAT IS BEFORE THE IN THE COMMITTEE ON THREE OF THEM INCLUDING BUTTE LOOMIS AND AND SANTA BARBARA DID NOT -- SIGN ON TO THE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE AND SINCE THEN SOME CONTRACTORS OR MEMBERS WITHIN LIKE SAN DIEGO FOR EXAMPLE HAVE RAISED SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT'S ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO WATER FIX ANOTHER THINGS IMPLIED FOR THEIR CONTRACTS. SO THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ON THE TABLE THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. ON THE FIRST POINT THAT I WANT TO WALK THROUGH IT I THINK THE SIMPLE AS FOREIGN. AND SOME OF YOUR IT REFERRED TO IT AND I'VE BEEN VERY ENCOURAGED BY WHAT YOU'VE HEARD. AND THAT IS QUITE SIMPLY. THIS NEEDS TO BE THE BEGINNING NOT THE END OF THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND THAT REFERS TO BOTH SETS OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THE THE CONTRACT THE SO CALLED CONTRACT EXTENSION AMENDMENTS WHICH ACTUALLY INCLUDE MORE. AND THE LEADERS SET OF WATER SUPPLY BEAMED ONES FOCUSED ON WATER FIX. OVERSIGHT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED ON BOTH MATTERS AND YES THEY ARE INTER RELATED. ON I AM A SOCCER DAD AND I'M GONNA RAISE WHAT I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE POINT HERE. ON EVENIF YOU LOVE WHAT D. W. R. IS TRYING TO DO INCLUDING THE WATER FIX PART OF IT -- I WOULD DESCRIBE. ANY ATTEMPT TO RELY THIS HEARING TODAY AS THE OPERATIVE HEARING REQUIRED UNDER WATER CODE ONE FORTY SEVEN POINT. FIVE ON THE B. FOR WHAT WHAT WHENEVER YOU REFERRED TO BEING OFF TO THE RACES ON THE SIXTY DAY PERIOD BEFORE YOU EXTEND THE CONTRACT. IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT IT WOULD BE THE LEGAL EQUIVALENT OF AN OWN GOAL IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE. THE TIMING THE THE SENSE OF URGENCY THAT D. W. ARE AND SOME OF THE CONTRACTORS HAVE BROUGHT IN HERE IS A BIT OUT OF SYNC WITH THE SEQUENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC REVIEW OF THE EXTENSION AMENDMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENTS CLOSE IN OCTOBER -- TWENTY SIXTEEN AND OF OR ON THE DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR THE CONTRACT EXTENSION PROJECT. LOOK CAREFULLY THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PACKET IN THE MATERIALS PROVIDED AN EVEN W. OURS WEBSITE. WHERE ARE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS? ON THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CRAFT E. IR YOU WILL UNFORTUNATELY NOT FIND THEM THERE YOU WILL FIND SOME EARLIER SCOPING COMMENTS BUT NOT THOSE. WHY IF THERE IS SUCH A RUSH IS GW ARE TAKEN SO LONG? TO RESPOND -- IN THE COMMENTS IF YOU LOOK THROUGH THEM SCOPING AS WELL AS THE THE COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT DIR WERE NOT SIMPLY GARDEN VARIETY YOU KNOW ARE ARE ALL THE DOTS -- DOTTED AND SO FORTH KINDS OF OBJECTIONS ON SANTA BARBARA COUNTY OFFICIALS ASKED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR A SPECIFIC ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE OF THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT SPECIFICALLY FOR TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS. WHETHER WERE VOTED THE PEOPLE WOULD BE REQUIRED -- TIONAL PROVISIONS ARE THEY COVERED OR THEY'RE NOT THAT ANALYSIS HAS NEVER BEEN PROVIDED. VIEWED IMPLEMENTS COUNTIES WERE CONCERNED THAT. EVEN IF OTHER APPROVALS WERE REQUIRED IT'S BEEN HAS BEEN DISCUSSED HERE -- THE EXTENSION AMENDMENTS BY PLANE INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN FACILITATING THE WATER FIX PROJECT THEY WERE TOLD IT TURNS OUT INCORRECTLY THAT WATER FIX WOULD ONLY BE ADDRESSED IN THE SECOND SET OF AMENDMENTS -- AND WE HAVE WE HAVE HEARD MORE ABOUT THAT. THAT TODAY IT IS VERY UNFORTUNATE THE D. W. R. HAS SAT ON THOSE COMMENTS FOR SO LONG BECAUSE IT THE DAY IT WOULD BE THE LINK BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF AMENMENTS AND THE REASON WHY THERE IS AN INDISPENSABLE STEP ON THE EXTENSION PARK FOR WATER FIX SPECIFICALLY. WOULD BE SO MUCH CLEARER IF THOSE COMMENTS HAD BEEN ADDRESS. THE REASON IT MATTERS UNDER WATER COOLED ONE FORTY SEVEN POINT FIVE IS THAT D. W. WARS OBLIGATION IS TO PROVIDE THE DETAILED TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WOULD SERVE AS THE TEMPLATE. FOR THE OTHER CONTRACTS. IF THIS WERE TREATED AS THE FINAL HEARING IT WOULD BE ON THE COLLISION COURSE WITH THE SEQUEL PROCESS WHICH MUST BE INTERACTIVE AND ALLOW FOR CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO PROJECT MODIFICATION INTACT. RELYING ON THIS IS THE HEARING WOULD CREATE KIND OF OF A PERVERSE DISINCENTIVE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROJECT THAT MIGHT IMPOSE LESS ENVIRONMENTAL AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN RESPONSE TO THAT PUBLIC CRITICISM. SO -- THE REASON WHY I CALLED IT AN OWN GOAL IS THAT THERE'S NO GOOD REASON THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE FINAL HEARING D. W. R. AS CONCEDED IN ITS MATERIALS THAT IT IS. IT CAN NOT ACTUALLY EXECUTE EITHER SET OF CONTRACT AMENDMENTS INCLUDING THE EXTENSION AMENDMENTS UNTIL IT COMPLETES ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AT LEAST ON THAT STAT -- SO THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT TO COME BACK AND I WOULD SAY ONCE BOTH THE INTER RELATED SETS OF AMENDMENTS. ARE TOGETHER AND WE KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT WHERE THIS PROCESS IS GOING AND AS IT'S BEEN CORRECTLY NOTED. THIS MORNING. THE COMMITTEE HAS THE DISCRETION TO IMPOSE OTHER KINDS OF OVERSIGHT AND PERHAPS LEGISLATION SHOULD BE IN ORDER AS WELL. BOMB. OF THERE ARE OTHER REQUIREMENTS BESIDE SICK WITH THE NEED TO BE MANAGED WELL THE DELTA COUNTIES COALITION IS CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THAT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES ANOTHER REQUIRED ANALYSES UNDERWATER CODE. ONE FORTY SEVEN HAD NEVER BEEN PROVIDED AND THEY ALSO POINTED OUT I THINK QUITE CORRECTLY THAT IT WOULD BE A CLASSIC PIECE MEALING ERROR. TO BOMB TO FAIL TO CONSIDER THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THESE TWO VERY RELATED SETS OF CONTRACT AMENDMENTS ONE AND THE EXTENSION ON AND THE OTHER ON WATER SUPPLY. AMENDMENTS IN SOME THERE IS NO DOWNSIDE TO BRINGING THE DEPARTMENT BACK HERE THEY CANNOT LAWFULLY FINALLY EXECUTE THE AMENDMENTS UNTIL THEY COMPLETE THAT PROCESS WHICH MAY GENERATE A WHOLE LOT MORE LIGHT. THAN THOSE SUPERFICIAL DISCUSSION OF THESE SUBJECTS WE HAVE SOMETIMES HEARD. THIS MORNING -- WITH RESPECT TO THE FORTHCOMING PROCESS ON THE WATER SUPPLY CONTRACT AMENDMENTS ONE CORRECTION OF I THINK THE DEPARTMENT AT ONE POINT REFERRED TO A NOTICE OF DETERMINATION ISSUING. IN IN FACT THAT WAS A NOTICE OF PREPARATION. THERE IS MUCH MORE TO BE DONE. THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO RAISE TODAY. IS THAT I THINK YOU HAVE ACTUALLY HEARD CONFIRMATION BEFORE THE PANEL THAT CONTRARY TO WHAT WOULD SOMEONE PUT IT SOMETIMES SAID BEFORE THIS HEARING. THE ELEPHANT REALLY IS IN THE ROOM. THE EXTENSION. SEPARATELY AND EVEN IN ADVANCE OF THE WORK -- SO CALLED WATER SUPPLY -- WATER FIX CONTRACT AMENDMENTS WOULD TAKE AN INDISPENSABLE STEP TO MAKE POSSIBLE REVENUE BONDS FOR WATER FIX THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE LAWFULLY ALLOWED UNDER THE STATE WATER PROJECT -- CONTRACTS I AM QUITE GRATEFUL. TO MS EHLERS OF FOUR CANDIDLY SAYING I THINK QUITE CORRECTLY THAT WALL OF COURSE OTHER APPROVALS ARE INVOLVED IN THE WATER FIX PROCESS -- IT -- BUT THE CONTRACT EXTENSION AMENDMENTS IN THEMSELVES WOULD I THINK -- FREEZE WAS PERFECT AND FACILITATE WATER PHIPPS THE LACK OF CANDOR THAT WE FRANKLY HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT TODAY QUESTION CLEARLY AND AND THROWING IN MORE FOG OF COMPLEXITY. I THINK IT SHOWS THE WISDOM OF THE APPROACH THAT THE L. A. L. HAS LONG ADVOCATED SUGGESTING A MORE RIGOROUS KIND OF OVERSIGHT OVER D. W. R. PERHAPS BRINGING IT ON TO THE BUDGET BUT CERTAINLY MAKING SURE. THAT THEY THAT THAT NEED EITHER SET OF AMENDMENTS WILL NOT PROCEED BASED AND BLIND FAITH THAT THEY ARE SERVING THE PUBLIC WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL BUT WE WILL BRING OUT THEIR BEST BY INSURING OVERSIGHT -- THE CONTRACT EXTENSION AMENDMENTS ARE UNFORTUNATELY QUITE MISNAMED BECAUSE WHILE IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE AND IT IS A BIG DEAL IN ITSELF THAT THERE IS A PROPOSED FIFTY YEAR -- EXTENSION OF THE CONTRACT TERMS pTHIS IS A BIGGER. THERE IS AND IT IS IN FACT A MAJOR REDEFINITION AN EXPANSION OF WHAT COUNTS FOR REVENUE BOND PURPOSES AS STATE OF AS AS FACILITIES -- THAT -- THAT WOULD IMPOSE ENORMOUS NEW RISKS AND COSTS ON THE PROJECT WORSE IS WHAT SOME EDITORIAL WRITERS OF KIND OF CORRECTLY ANALOGIZE TO A TIME MACHINE -- NOT IF IF OF WATER FIX AND PERHAPS OTHER BIG PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE. BECOME COVER PROJECTS THEY WILL BE TREATED AS IF THEY WERE PART OF THE ORIGINAL PROJECT LIKE THE PRE EIGHTY SEVEN FACILITIES -- WHICH ALSO RAISES A GRAVE CONCERN ABOUT CIRCUMVENTION OF THAT -- CONSTITUTIONAL TAX PROVISIONS. THAT. THAT ARE NOW IN PLACE THAT. THEY WERE THERE ARE MAJOR RISKS FOR REPAIRS AND TAXPAYERS THAT HAVE NOT. BEEN ADDRESSED -- THE FACT ISTHAT -- BE EXTENSION AMENDMENTS THEMSELVES ARE. INDISPENSABLE FOR REVENUE BONDS TO BE IMPOSED FOR BEFORE WATER FIX -- THE URGENCY FRANKLY IS BECAUSE D. W. R. BY TRYING TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION OF MOMENTUM ON THE FOUNDERING WATER FIX PROJECT. PUT ITSELF IN A BOX BY MOVING AHEAD TOO FAST ON TWO THINGS IT HAS A PENDING APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL FUNDING -- THAT AS SOON AS A FIFTY YEAR TIME FRAME -- ALSO -- JUMPED THE GUN AND WENT TO COURT LAST JULY TO VALIDATE REVENUE BOND RESOLUTIONS -- FOR WATER FIX IT AS SOON THAT THEY CAN BE PAID BACK TO TWENTY EIGHTY FIVE AND COVER FACILITIES THAT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACTS. THE CONTRACTS THEMSELVES THOUGH ARE NOT -- ARE ARE NOT SOUGHT FOR VALIDATION ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL HAVE TO BE DETERMINED THERE IS OUR BELIEF THAT THAT THE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ATTEMPTING AN END RUN AROUND THIS VERY. THIS VERY PROCESS. YOU HAVE HEARD A FEW THINGS HERE TODAY -- THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DEFLECT ATTENTION FROM THE CLEAR NEED. TO AMEND. THROUGH THESE SO CALLED EXTENSION PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT WATER FIX WILL BE COVERED BUT FOR REVENUE BONDS -- ONE IS REFERRED TO IN THE BACKGROUND. MEMO -- FOR THIS HEARING IT'S ON PAGE THREE THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT ARTICLE ONE EIGHTY OF THE EXISTING CONTRACTS WHICH DEFINES WATERFORD SYSTEM FACILITIES FOR WHICH REVENUE BONDS MAY BE SOLD. ALREADY AUTHORIZES THE SALE OF BONDS TO FINANCE CONSTRUCTION OF WATER FIXED FACILITIES. ARTICLE ONE EIGHTY IF YOU LOOK THROUGH THE CURRENT CONTRACTS DOES NOT EXIST. WATER RESISTANT FACILITIES ARE DEFINED IN ARTICLE ONE H. H. AND FRANKLY THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT CLEARER IF YOU W. R. HADN'T BURIED AND NOT CONFRONTED THOSE COMMENTS ON THE CONTRACT EXTENSION DRAFT ER. ALTHOUGH WE'VE HEARD A SUGGESTION FROM ITS PRIOR THIS MORNING I BELIEVE THAT THAT -- THAT. ARTICLE ONE H. H. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ALL OF THIS. BK OR AT LEAST IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE FINANCING -- ALLOCATION I THINK THE PHRASE WAS AS WELL OF WATER FAVES. THE PAPER TRAIL. THAT IS PROVIDED IN THE PUBLIC COMMENTS STILL ON A DRESS DIRECTLY DISPROVES THAT -- THE COMMENTS OF OF THE PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE AND UP. BUNCH OF OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SAY ON ON THE DRAFT AGAIN GO WAY BEYOND THE GARDEN MORE WITH THE GARDEN VARIETY THEY ACTUALLY READ IF YOU LOOK AT THE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S LEADING FINANCIAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE A MIGHT A SMALLER OR WELL. WATER RETOOLING OF THE BIG SHORT BOMB THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CONCERNS. THAT THE SO CALLED EXTENSION AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY BUNDLED IN MAJOR NEWS SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND COSTS UNDER THE MISLEADING RUBRIC OF AN EXTENSION. BOMB SO ONE OF THE EXHIBITS THAT I REFERRED TO IN MY LETTER WAS AN ANALYSIS BY STAPLE THAT HAD THIS QUOTE. PWRS LEGAL COUNSEL HAS CONCLUDED THAT BBC P. THE PREDECESSOR TO THE CURRENT WATER FIX PROJECT IS NOT ON THE LIST OF APPROVED PROJECTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING INCLUDING THROUGH BOND FINANCING. IF THESE PUBLIC COMMENTS HAD BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY THEY WOULD HAVE SHOWED THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS ACTUALLY QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF FACILITIES AND KNEW. THAT IN ADDITION TO EXTENDING THE CONTRACT LENGTH -- DEFINITION OF FACILITIES WE NEED TO BE CHANGED AND EXPANDED IN ORDER TO CUT COVER REVENUE BONDS -- FOUR WATER CHECKS -- SO THAT -- THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW IT HAS DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH THE POOLS OF WATER FIX IT IS IT IS NOT THE POINT THE POINT IS THAT THEY HAD TO CHANGE THAT PROVISION -- IN ORDER TO DO OTHERWISE THE OTHER SUGGESTION FOR MS MAN AT THIS MORNING THAT YOU HEARD WAS THAT THAT IT COULD BE A COVERED FACILITY BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- IT SAYS WHAT IT THINGS WATER SYSTEM FACILITY SHOULD BE AND DID SO WITH RESPECT TO WATER FIX. ON THEIR ATTENDS A BAT DOCUMENTS ASSOCIATE WITH THE WATER FIX PROJECT BUT YOU ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT TWO PAGES -- TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT THERE IS AN ORDER CALL PROJECT ORDER NUMBER FORTY ON IT THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE SEQUEL PROCESS OR THE CONTRACT EXTENSION PROCESS. BUT WAS RELIED ON IN THE DEPARTMENT'S REVENUE BONDS. FOR WATER FIX AND THIS. UNACCOUNTABLE ON REVIEW DOCUMENT IN A COUPLE OF PARAGRAPHS ATTEMPTED TO SUMMARILY REDEFINED ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES. IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHETHER SOME KIND OF CONVEYANCE FACILITY -- AROUND THE DELTA. WOULD BE INCLUDED -- FOR PROJECT. FOR PROJECT REVENUE BONDS -- VW ARE NOTIFIED THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTORS OF IT -- ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THEY NOTE SOME INTERESTING THINGS -- FIRST THAT THIS PROJECT ORDER. WAS. ISSUED THE SAME DAY BUT AFTER THE DEPARTMENT HEAD EXECUTED. THE OF ITS HIS ACTIONS. ON THE E. I. R. CERTIFICATION AND IT ALSO INDICATES THIS PROJECT ORDER ADDS THE FACILITIES KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA WATER FIXES UNITS OF THE STATE. PROJECT SO. THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T RELY ON THIS PHANTOM AUTHORITY THAT IT SAYS IT MAY HAVE UNDER OTHER KUNDER OTHER CONTRACT PROVISIONS THE GAME HERE. IS THAT DATE JUMP THE GUN AND TRY TO IMPOSE BINDING OBLIGATIONS. THAT THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS WILL HAVE TO PAY ON A POTENTIAL BLANK CHECK FOR WATER FIXED COSTS WITHOUT BEING CANDID ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING. IT IS IN COMMON ON THIS. COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT OVERSIGHT. IS AS VIGOROUS IN NEED AS IT NEEDS TO BE IN THIS SITUATION -- THE NEXT POINT THAT IS RELATED TO THIS ONE I WANT TO RAISE BEFORE YOU MOVE ON SIR IF I COULD JUST SAY WE ARE IN RECEIPT OF YOUR LETTER I THINK ALL THE PANELS WERE GIVEN ITS TIME ALLOTMENT AND YOU'VE EXCEEDED YOURSELF I COULD ASK YOU. TO WRAP UP I CAN BE VERY BRIEF FOR THE REST I APPRECIATE THAT HOLIDAYS FOR THAT THAT'S OKAY AND TO COVER WHAT A BUNCH OF SPEAKERS UPSET AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY -- THE COMPRESSION ARGUMENT IS FRANKLY A RED HERRING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE A CONTRACT THE CHART THAT THE OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACT. CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION THE METROPOLITAN REFERRED. TO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT V. CONTRACT EXTENSION AMENDMENTS WITH WATER PHIPPS AND OTHER RISKY PROJECTS BUNDLED AND IS WHAT'S NECESSARY TO TAKE CARE OF THE COMPRESSION PROBLEM. IT JUST SAYS YOU NEED TO EXTEND THE CONTRACTS -- ALONG THE SAME LINES THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER COALITION LETTER -- TALK SAYS WELL BASICALLY YOU GET LOWER PAYMENTS TO IF YOU WERE TO SAY GO FROM A FIFTEEN YEAR MORTGAGE TO A THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGE. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM THOUGH IS THE RADICAL REDEFINITION OF FACILITIES WHAT THIS IS A LITTLE MORE LIKE WOULD BE TO SAY WELL YOU CAN LOWER YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENTS. IF YOU -- EXTEND THE THE CONTRACT LENGTH BUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO ASSUME THAT IT'S A DONE DEAL THAT ALONG WITH THIS YOU WILL THROW IN A REALLY REALLY COSTLY RENOVATION OF UNDETERMINED AMOUNT THAT MIGHT MIGHT GO INTO THE BILLIONS. IN OTHER WORDS IT'S SOMETHING THAT LOOKS A LITTLE MORE LIKE THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE ADDITIONS -- THAT PRECEDED THE FINANCIAL CRISIS ON TAKING SOMETHING THAT HAS BRAGGED ABOUT AS TRIPLE A SUPPOSEDLY AND BUNDLING IN. POTENTIALLY STAGGERING RISKS AND COSTS THE TAXPAYERS AND REPAIRS -- WILL HAVE TO PAY. THE CONTRACT EXTENSION PROCESS CANNOT BE RESOLVED SO -- WITH SO LITTLE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS AMONG THE UNADDRESSED ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE CONFRONTED IN A SERIOUS WAY. ARE. UNSUSTAINABLE CONDITION OF THE CURRENT DELTA AND THE NEED TO TAKE SERIOUSLY. THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE LAW TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON ON DELTA WATER SOURCES AND ENCOURAGE LOCAL SELF RELIANCE -- YOU HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE ALL PAPER WATER GAP BETWEEN -- ENTITLEMENTS AND AND WHAT CAN BE RELIABLY DELIVERED IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT THE REAL CONDITIONS ARE THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SO WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MANY -- GROUPS -- COUNTY NEWS AGENCIES. THAT HAVE EXPRESSED MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO DO THIS IS NOT A NORTH AND SOUTH DISPUTE THIS IS NOT A DISPUTE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND AGRICULTURE AND EVERYBODY ELSE. THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY. A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY QUITE CONTRARY TO THE IMAGE OF RESILIENCE AND PREPAREDNESS FOR THE FUTURE CONDITIONS. THE ON THINKING ADDITION OF RISK AND COST TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT THE T. W. R. NOW PROPOSES -- WILL PROMOTE OUTMODED. TWENTY TWENTIETH CENTURY APPROACHES. FOCUSING ON UNSUSTAINABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON LOCAL SELF RELIANCE CONSERVATION AND RESILIENCE. THE REALITY IS THAT WE CANNOT PAY FOR BOTH WHICH MEANS BEFORE ANY OF THESE CONTRACTAMENDMENTS ARE EXTENDED -- WE MUST HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. THAT WE CAN MAKE A REAL CHOICE. ORVILLE SHOWS -- BY AS THE MONORAIL AMENDMENTS EXPERIAN SHOWS WERE REPORT THE DEPARTMENT TOOK THE ADVICE OF A LOCAL CONTRACTOR AFFILIATE. WHO SAID THAT -- THE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE THEY WOULD AVOID LITIGATION THAT WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF LITIGATION AGO. SOMETIMES GW ARE WHICH CAN ACT ADMIRABLY INTERNS DONE GREAT THINGS CAN BE ITS OWN WORST ENEMY AND THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE TO HAVE ENOUGH OVERSIGHT. THAT IT BRINGS OUT ITS BEST IN IS NOT IT'S WHAT WE'RE STANDING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] YOU. OF MISTER MOORE I DID NOTICE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD -- KNOW WHEN SEARCHING ELSON ASKED THE QUESTION OF THE PREVIOUS PANEL -- ASKED WHETHER THERE POINTS REPRESENT THE PERSPECTIVE OF ALL TWENTY NINE CONTRACTORS DO YOU WANT TO ELABORATE ON THAT AT ALL YES BRIEF BRIEFLY PLEASE. SAY SORRY ABOUT THAT -- INTO IS THAT THERE IS NO CONSENSUS IN FACT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON WHETHER THE DEPARTMENTS VERSION OF THE CONTRACT EXTENSION WHICH BUNDLES IN THE PART THAT WOULD FACILITATE WATER FIX. IT ALSO MAKES IT EASIER -- FOR THE LARGEST CONTRACTORS IF THEY HAD COVERED BY 80% OF THE THE ALLEGATIONS. TO IMPOSE NEW PROJECTS. THOSE HAVE NOT BEEN AGREED TO BY ALL THE CONTRACTORS THE VERY SEPARATE QUESTION THOUGH IS WHETHER SOME KIND OF EXTENSION WHEN NEGOTIATIONS ARE COMPLETE WHEN THE PUBLIC HAS MORE INFORMATION WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO ALL -- THERE WERE EIGHT AS WAS REFERRED TO A COUPLE OF TIMES THIS MORNING THEY'RE ACTUALLY MECHANISMS IN THE EXISTING CONTRACT -- PARTICULARLY ARTICLE FOR THE THE SO CALLED EVERGREEN CLAUSE FOR VISION WHICH WERE REALLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN ABILITY TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT WITHOUT RAILROADING CONTRACTORS WHO DON'T WANT. TO INTO TAKING ON BIG RESTRAIN COSTS THAT THAT THEY WANT TO AVOID. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OF MISTER MOORE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN THE WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION YOU SHARE MUCH TO OUR PANELS ON AT THIS TIME -- WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS INVITE CONGRESS MEN MCNERNEY.

THANK YOU I WANNA THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TIME TO SPEAK HERE. COURSE -- I'M JERRY MCNERNEY I REPRESENT CALIFORNIA'S NINTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. BY DISTRICT INCLUDES ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST YOUR RESOURCES CALIFORNIA DELTA. THE DELTA SUPPORTS THE FARMERS AND BUSINESSES OF OUR COMMUNITY AND BRINGS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VISITORS TO OUR REGION EVERY YEAR. BUT IT'S MORETHAN JUST A WATER SOURCE THE DELTA IS THE CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC LIFEBLOOD OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE THAT ALL SEEMS TO BE THREATENED. THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS OF THE WATER FIX TUNNELS WILL GRAVELY DAMAGED THE DELTA ECOSYSTEM AND HURT THE FARMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON IT. BY SIMPLY HOLDING THIS HEARING THE COMMITTEE IS PUSHING THIS. WATER FIX PROJECT ONE STEP CLOSER TO COMPLETION. I LITTLE LETTER ALONG WITH THREE OF MY COLLEAGUES. VIRGIN THIS COMMITTEE TO CANCEL TODAY'S HEARINGS. YOUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE DELTA. HAVE ALSO ASKS YOU TO POSTPONE THIS HEARING CALIFORNIA'S FROM ACROSS THE STATE HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR OPPOSITION. AND I'M HERE NOT ONLY AS A VOICE. OF FOR MY CONSTITUENTS BUT THE VOICE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME BUT THIS COMMITTEE HAS A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY TODAY WHILE IT'S CLEAR THAT THE HEARING WILL NOT TRIGGER FULL FUNDING. FOR THE WATER FISKE PROJECT IT'S ALSO A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT. I WANT TO ECHO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS OF THE PANELS. WHO HAVE SPOKEN HERE TODAY AT THE CLOSE OF THE COMMITTEE TO COMMIT AND I WORKED WITH QUEST THE COMMITTEE? TO COMMIT TO HOLDING ADDITIONAL HEARINGS AND PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED OVERSIGHT FOR THE WATER SEWAGE WATER FIX PROJECT BEFORE WE MOVE ANY FURTHER. THERE'S MUCH MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO KNOW THE TRUE COST. THE LEGALITY AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THIS PROJECT. FELLOW YOU'LL BACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR I YOUR TENDED STAY WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING. MISSISSIPPI VISOR. THANK YOU AND WE ARE IN A POSITION OF YOUR LETTER REPRESENTING THE DELTA COUNTIES COALITION. THANK YOU FOR COMING JR MITCHELL MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A ATTENTION AND PATIENCE. I AM DONNA TOLD HIM A MEMBER OF THE SECOND OKAY BORDER SUPERVISORS IN CURRENTLY SERVICE THE CHAIR PERSON TO TELL THE COUNTIES COALITION WHICH REPRESENTS THE COUNTIES OF SACRAMENTO SOLANO SOMEONE KEEN KUTTER COSTA IN YOU'LL COUNTIES. AND AS YOU NOTED DENTURE MITCHELL YOU DO HAVE A COPY OF THE LETTER SO I WON'T BE WERE DONE IN THAT REGARD. I DO WANT TO NOTE THOUGH THAT -- THINK AFTER TODAY'S TESTIMONY THERE'S NO QUESTION OF THESE AMENDMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO FACILITATE THE FUTURE FINANCING CONSTRUCTION OF MANY PROJECTS WHICH INCLUDE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX THE TWIN TUNNELS. WE BELIEVE THAT BEFORE THESE CONTRACTS ARE EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS APPRECIATED -- SENATOR PAT PINTED OUT THAT YOU QUIT QUIT TO SIXTY SEVEN YEARS -- AND SO SOMEONE MORE TODAY WOULD BE CELEBRATING HER SIXTY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY. ABOUT TIME THESE NEXT WOULD EXPIRE. BUT WITH THAT WE BELIEVE THAT SUBSEQUENTLY FINANCING FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CONSTRUCT THE TUNNELS IS GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT BEFORE THAT. THIS BODY AND ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF JUST WHAT THESE OTHER PENDING AMENDMENTS. WILL REALLY PROVIDE. FOR ADULT CARIES COALITION RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES PRESENT TO THIS COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC THE ENTIRETY OF THE PENDING STATE WATER CONTRACT AMENDMENTS RELATED NOT ONLY PROPOSED EXTENSIONS. BUT TO THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIXED. AND THEN YOU ALSO REQUIRE AN ASK OF THE PART OF WATER RESOURCES TO PRODUCE A VIABLE TRANSPARENT A COMPLETE FINANCING PLAN ALONG WITH THE TRUE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. ACCORD WITH IT GORDON'S WITH ITS OWN GUIDELINES FOR THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX. IT IS CLEAR FROM TESTIMONY TODAY THAT WITHOUT THESE COURT DOCUMENTS FINANCING FOR THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX IS IN SERIOUS DOUBT I THINK THE QUESTIONS FROM THE DYESS. POINTED OUT VERY CLEARLY. SO THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING WE BELIEVE CERTAINLY HAS GIVEN THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ITS VOICE HEARD ON AN ISSUE WHICH WE HAVE A LONG LASTING. AND NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE DELTA REGION. DELTA COMMUNITIES WILL EXPERIENCE PERMANENT ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE INDOOR THE LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL LAND AND BUSINESSES. AND THE DESTRUCTION A WAY OF LIFE THE TWIN TUNNELS CALIFORNIA WATER FISH PROJECT PROCEEDS. PLEASE PLEASE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF A FULL AND TRANSPARENT EXAMINATION OF ALL THE LONG TERM WATER CONTRACT AMENDMENT SO THAT THE DIGITAL HEARING AIDS. AND A REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE CONDUCTED BY THE LEGISLATURE GOING FORWARD AND THEN THROUGH THE NEW NEW NEXT ADMINISTRATION IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THANKS SO MUCH FOR TENSION FOR YOUR ATTENTION TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING. AS OUR HONOR TO HAVE YOU -- AND THE CONGRESSMAN SO LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE CUED UP I'M GOING -- TO US DALGLISH SOME GAME RULES IF IF YOU. DON'T MIND -- LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE -- WE COULD GO AT LEAST EASILY FORTY FORTY FIVE MINUTES. WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK IS THAT YOU -- LISTEN TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU FEEL FREE TO ASSOCIATE YOUR COMMENTS WITH SOMEONE WHO'S ALREADY TESTIFIED. I THINK WE HAVE CLARIFIED THAT THE POINT OF TODAY'S CONVENING. IS TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE US THAT IS NOT A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH WATER FIX. SO I'M REALLY GOING TO IMPLORE YOU THAT IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS RELATIVE TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU SHARE THOSE FIRST I'M NOT GOING TO STOP YOU FROM SAYING. HERE IN YOUR OPINION ABOUT WHAT A FIX ON CLEAR THAT'S WHY MOST OF YOU TRAVEL HERE TODAY -- I THINK MISTER MOORE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB AREAS OF THE ACTUAL AMENDMENTS BEFORE US TODAY. THAT HE HAD ISSUE WITH SO I'M GOING TO ASK THAT YOU USE THE BULK OF YOUR TIME THERE. I'M GOING TO WATCH THE CLOCK AND GIVE EVERYONE A MINUTE. TO SHARE YOUR TESTIMONY WITH THAT WE'LL HAVE OUR FIRST WITNESS AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD NOPE RIGHT THERE AT THE MIKE SIR. THANK YOU FEEL FREE TO MOVE THE MIKE UP CLOSER. MY NAME IS WILLIAM DIALING ME -- RETIRED PROFESSOR OF ACCOUNTING AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY AND A CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT. AND I'VE CERTAINLY LEARNED QUITE A BIT HERE TODAY -- I HAD LEARNED THE U. T. W. R. LIKE STOP RATE ON DELIBERATE SPEED. BUT YET THEY HAVE FIFTY YEAR OLD FACILITIES THAT THEY HAVEN'T -- REFURB TO REPLACED. I WAS IN AUSTIN THE NAVY IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WITH A PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM I LEARNED TODAY THE D. W.. OUR RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED SUCH A SYSTEM PROBABLY FIFTY YEARS BEHIND THE TIMES. HI THIS FINANCIAL COMPRESSION IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY. A SEVENTEEN YEAR BOND VERSUS THE THIRTY YEAR BOND. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK ON PAGE THREE OF WHAT YOU PASSED OUT TO US. IT SAYS HERE THE DEPARTMENT INDICATES BONDS WITH LONGER TERMS AND THEREFORE LOWER REPAYMENT BECAUSE MAY BE USED FOR CAPITAL. INDICATES LATER IN HERE THAT THAT'S A CHEAPER WAY TO GO LEAVE THIS YOU GET A FIFTEEN YEAR BOND VERSES A THIRTY YEAR BOND HE PACKABLE UNLESS OF COST. LET ME MAKE SURE I GET THIS IN AND IF EVERYBODY WOULD TAKE A LOOK. ON PAGE FOR THE VERY LAST SENTENCE ON PAGE FOUR SAYS THIS. AND I QUOTE. PWR CAN EXPAND US W. P. FEES WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. IF THAT IS TRUE EVERYTHING IS SAID TO YOU TODAY MEANS NOTHING. IN CENTER PANEL TO BE TOLD ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THE LAW IS GOING TO INDICATE WHAT'S DONE HERE AND WHAT'S ALLOWED. NOT WITH SOMEBODY PROMISED YOU TO DO. YOUR CRAZY IF YOU GIVE UP WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS YOUR ONLY CONTROL OVER THESE WATER PEOPLE. IF YOU GIVE UP AND LET THEM DO THIRTY YEAR BONDS DID YOU HEAR THAT ONE DO FORTY YEAR BONDS. WHY NOT FIFTY YOUR BOSS ONE ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS WHY DON'T WHY NOT ONLY INTEREST ONLY BOND SO THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS CAN MAKE PAYMENTS IN PERPETUITY? IS THERE A LIMIT TO WHAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE. I TOLD YOU I'M A CPA OKAY. AND THE MOST COMMON THING THAT. MY MY CLIENTS TELL ME COME TO ME AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. HOW CAN I LEAVE THIS STATE COME VISIT BUT STOPPED PAYING ALL THESE TAXES AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? CHARGES WHEN THE NEXT RECESSION HITS WE KNOW LITTLE HEAD. WHEN 1% OF THE TAXPAYERS AREN'T PAYING 50% OF THE STATE INCOME TAX YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE HECK OF A MESS ON YOUR HANDS? YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA IS CONSIDER THEM. DON'T LET A PROJECT LIKE THIS GO WHERE THE COSTS ARE GONNA BE UNBELIEVABLE. DID YOU FORGET ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE PICTURES LEAVE IN A WAR BILL BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THE DAM WAS GOING TO FALL. ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS QUARTER IN FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. ASK ABOUT OUR STATE BILLION DOLLARS THAT SUPPOSE IT WILL COST SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION TO COMPLETE. GIVE THE TAXPAYERS A BREAK. STOP THIS WATER FIX DO IT THE RIGHT WAY MAKE SURE ALL THE EMBEDDABLE THINGS ARE TAKEN CARE OF MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THE PHYSICAL COSTS ARE GOING TO BE. DEALT STICK THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WITH UNBELIEVABLE BERG. OKAY BEFORE NEXT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. THAT WAS THREE MINUTES TO ALL THOSE STANDING BEHIND ME IN LINE. WE ACTUALLY DID. THAT MAKES TWO OF US MAN WE'VE ALL BEEN SITTING HERE TOO SO LET ME JUST TRY TO RESPECT AND HONOR ALL THOSE WHO'VE CUED UP BECAUSE WE'VEGOT TO RESPECT AND HONOR EACH OTHER. AND YOU SEE -- I'M GONNA SIT HERE TO THE VERY END I'M GONNA ASK AND WE DO THIS -- IN BUDGET HEARINGS ALL THE TIME SO TRUST ME IN BEFORE I WAS ELECTED OFFICER. BEFORE I RAN FOR OFFICE I WAS A MEMBER THE PUBLIC BECAME A TESTIFIED IT CAN BE DONE IN ONE MINUTE YOU CAN'T GET TO YOUR ROOT PROBLEM. I APPRECIATE ITS EMOTIONAL AND PEOPLE HAVE COME FOR PAST HEARINGS BUT I AM GOING TO ASK. THAT YOU RESPECT THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WERE BEHIND YOU. AND KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO ONE MINUTE. AND PREVENT ME FROM HAVING TO CUT THE MIKES. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO RESPECT EACH OTHER EVEN IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO RESPECT NEAR THE PROCESS. NEXT WITNESS. YES THANK YOU MY NAME IS CLIFF SANDER AND I'M A RESIDENT OF SAN RAMON CALIFORNIA -- ONE THING I GOT OUT OF THIS HEARING TODAY WAS WITH REGARDS TO OVERSIGHT -- IT SEEMS TO ME IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THE OVERSIGHT IS FAIRLY LIMITED RIGHT NOW FOR THE LEGISLATURE. SO MY EMPHASIS WOULD BE THAT YOU FOLKS TAKE THAT WITH YOU AND CONSIDR. STRENGTHENING THAT UP AND MAKING THINGS MANDATORY STRICT AND PERIODIC. BECAUSE WHEN THINGS ARE HANDLED IN KIND OF A CURSORY OVERSIGHT AS NEEDED THEY BRING SOMETHING TO YOU AT CETERA. THOSE THINGS CHANGE WITH THE TIMES AND WITH NO DISRESPECT TO THIS COMMITTEE SOME COMMITTEES MIGHT DECIDE IT'S NOT IMPORTANT IT GETS POSTPONED IT GETS STAYED. IT'S NEVER HEARD THE CHAIRMAN DOESN'T LIKE IT MAYBE HE'S A PROPONENT OF WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. HERE SHE EXCUSE ME. THAT'S THOUGH JUST BE BY EMPHASIS THE OVERSIGHT THAT. CAN BE MADE STATUTORY MANDATORY IT NEEDS TO BE STRONG. THE CW ARE ONLY NEEDS. ANOTHER DISCRETION TO OPERATE AND FUNCTION AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAND CUFFS BUT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE FREE REIGN EITHER. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. NEXT WITNESS ONE MINUTE PLEASE I'M GAIL DEL HAND WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION OUR MEMBERS ARE STATEWIDE AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION THAT GROWS FRESH PRODUCE -- I WANNA THANK YOU TODAY FOR HOLD HEARING -- FINANCIAL STABILITY -- IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS CRITICAL TO THE COST OF WATER TO FARMERS THANK YOU. YEAH THIS ONE MINUTE. GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN CHILL AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS BARBERA GET PEREA WITH RESTORE THE DELTA. THANK YOU FOR THE WAY YOU CONDUCTED THE HEARING TODAY WE'RE GRATEFUL. WE'RE STILL TROUBLED BY THE FIFTY YEAR CONTRACT TALKS ON FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AND I WILL EXPAND ON WHAT MISTER MOORE SAID. THE WATER FIX. HAS FORMED A GPA. KNOWN AS THE DESIGN CONSTRUCTION FINANCE AUTHORITY. THEY ARE ADVANCING A WITH FIELD LOAN PROCESS WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WITHOUT A FINANCIAL PLAN. A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OR AN AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS FOR REPAIRS. WITHOUT PERMITS FROM THE WATER BOARD. AND WITHOUT A RECORD OF DECISION FROM THE FEDERAL WITH THE LOANS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. THIS FIFTY YEAR CONTRACT CHECKS OFF A BOX FOR THE WITH FEEL LOAN PROCESS. THE FINANCE GPA IS ALSO WORKING ON AN ANALYSIS OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT FOR WATER FIX. WILL OUR STATE WATER SUPPLY BE OPERATED ON OUR PRIVATE INVESTMENT. IS PART OF THE DEBT LOAD. HOW DOES THAT SQUARE UP WITH THE PUBLIC TRUST? WITH D. W. R. BONDING STABILITY. HOW DOES THAT SQUARE WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND WATER BEING PART OF THE PUBLIC TRUST? THESE ARE VERY BIG QUESTIONS. WE HOPE THAT YOU DELVE MUCH FURTHER INTO THIS BUT THERE HAS TO BE ALSO FIND US. A LOOK AT HOW THIS DEAL CFA IS OPERATING WITHIN THE PARAMETER OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACT AND WHAT IS THAT CONNECTION WITH D. W. R.. THANK YOU. YOU NEXT WHEN IT. X. WITNESS ONE MINUTE. GOOD AFTERNOON KYLE JONES HYSTERICAL CALIFORNIA I JUST WANTED TO ECHO THE POINTS MADE BY MISTER MOORE -- MISS PREFER RESTORE THE DELTA REGARDING CONCERNS ABOUT WATER JUST KIND OF TAKE THE TIME TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A LACK OF TRUST BETWEEN A LOT OF THE PUBLIC AND HOW D. W. OR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS BEEN OPERATING. FOCUSING ALMOST ALL THEIR EFFORTS TOWARDS GETTING THIS TUNNEL PROJECT MOVING AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER PROJECTS AND WE THINK THAT THERE DOES NEED TO BE STATUTORY CHANGES TO INCREASE OVERSIGHT. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT -- ELEVATED AND THAT INCLUDES MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING PROJECTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S PUBLIC SAFETY -- AND ALSO TO THAT CAN INCREASE WATER SUPPLY AND AND MORE INVESTMENTS IN UPPER WATERSHEDS TO ENSURE THAT THAT THAT THINGS ARE OPERATING LIKE THEY SHOULD SO IMPLORE THAT THE BIGGEST LESSON WE TAKE FROM THIS. IS THAT THERE DOES NEED TO BE A GREATER ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS PROCESS AND MORE IN A OF A BARRIER BETWEEN TWO TO BE ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTORS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS OCEAN RESERVE I REPRESENT A LOCAL AGENCIES OF THE NORTH DELTA WHICH IS A ALLIANCE OF WATER AND WATER LEVY DISTRICTS AND WATER DISTRICTS AN ADULT AS WELL AS FRIENDS OF STONE LAKES NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE THE PROPOSED INTAKES WOULD. BE AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID THAT THE YOU KNOW IT'S DEFINITELY CLEAR THAT THESE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE THE CONTRACT EXTENSION MANAGEMENT'S FACILITATE FINDING THE DELTA TUNNELS. AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FULL COST OF THE DELTA* TUNNELS WOULD BE NOR THE COST OF OF HUGE PROJECTS LIKE ORVILLE THESE KIND OF MEGAPROJECTS DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ESTIMATES. AND YET THIS INDEBTEDNESS THAT WOULD BE FACILITATED BY THOSE EXTENSIONS -- WOULD BE PLACED ON THE PUBLIC AND I WOULD NOTE THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED TODAY THAT THE FEDERAL PARTICIPATION IN WATER IN THE DELTA TUNNELS PROJECT IS REALLY IN QUESTION RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO FORMAL CVP PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT. AND IT MAY BE THAT IT'S THE STATE WATER PROJECT ONLY -- FACILITY WHICH REALLY COULD DO RATE PAYERS WITHIN CALIFORNIA -- AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE LEGISLATURE BE THE ADULT IN THE ROOM PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT THAT'S NEEDED SO THAT IDW ARE DOESN'T MOVE FORWARD ON A RECKLESS PATH THAT WOULD DO THAT -- AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE STATE WATER PROJECT WAS INITIALLY ESTIMATED TO BE ONE POINT FIVE SEVEN ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION AS WAS MENTONED BUT THAT COST HAS ESCALATED UP. TO SEVEN BILLION -- SO. D. W. R. SHOULD IF IT'S REALLY NOT. NOT IF THESE OTHER AMENDMENTS NEED TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO FACILITATE OTHER THINGS THAT THERE MIGHT LONG PLEASE. CONSENSUS AROUND DO YOU HAVE YOUR SHOULD ACCEPT FUNDING FOR THE DELTA TUNNELS FROM THESE AMENDMENTS AND I WOULD ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE HOLD OPEN THIS HEARING AND NOT CLOSE IT AND THAT IT CONDUCTED THE EXTENSIVE OVERSIGHT THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED. THANK YOU. AS A MAN CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TOM MCCARTHY I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER FROM A HOBBY WATER AGENCY WE ARE A STATE CONTRACTOR.

FINANCIAL COMPRESSION WE JUST WANTED TO SAY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE FINANCIAL COMPRESSIONS REAL. WE LIKE TO KEEP COSTS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CONFERRAL SENEGAL COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY -- TRANSPARENCIES BEEN -- REAL STRONG THEMES EMERGE FROM HEARING TODAY AND WHILE. THE CITY OR COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS SUPPORTS THE WATER IX PROJECT AT THIS CURRENTLY ENVISIONED. CONDITIONED UPON ENSURING THAT THE ALLOCATION OF COSTS BY D. W. R. BY THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT -- TO ITS SUBCONTRACTORS IS DONE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THOSE CLASSES STORE KLAY AS WATER SUPPLY. TRANSPARENCY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURING THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT COST ALLOCATION LOOKS LIKE. FIRST A WATER PROJECTS SUBCONTRACTOR LIKE US A KEY TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THAT TRANSPARENCY FOR US TO FOR A SUBCONTRACTOR METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT AS UNDERSTANDING THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE COSTS. THROUGH ACCESS TO MUCH BALTIMORE DISTRICT FULLY ALL RIGHT MODEL WHICH IS THE EXCEL SPREADSHEET THAT METROPOLITAN USES THE ALLOCATED COSTS. RATES AND CHARGES TO ITS CUSTOMERS -- WE CAN WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE SENATE -- TO TRY -- TO YOU SECURE -- RELEASING COMMITMENT BY MUCH FAULT HIM FOR THAT FULLY FUNCTIONAL RATE MODEL WE WOULD -- ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO TO HELP OUT AND NOT IN ANY WAY YOU POSSIBLY CAN THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT NEXT WITNESS ONE MINUTE.

HOW HOW COSTS CAN INCREASE DUE TO COMPRESSION WE RECENTLY COMPLETED -- A PROJECT A DELIVERY ARE BUILT FOR US -- EXTENDING THE STATE WATER PROJECT TO OUR SERVICER WAS ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE LAST SERIES OF BONDS THAT WAS FLOATED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE BONDS BEING FLOATED FOR THIRTY YEARS. AND BEING FLOATED -- FOR EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN WHICH THEY WERE A LOT I PERCENT DIFFERENCE IN COST. SO AGAIN I JUST WANTED REVIVE ONE EXAMPLE ABOUT HOW COMPRESSION IS REALLY IMPACTING RATES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TRAVEL TIME TIME WITH NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS AND THE TESTIMONY PROVIDED BY MISTER MOORE -- SIERRA CLUB RESTORE THE DELTA -- MISMAS SERVE. AND ALSO -- THE THEME OF THE LAST COMMENTS FROM THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY AROUND TRANSPARENCY ON THE COSTS. ASSOCIATED AND IF -- WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IN ORDER -- TO IMPLEMENT THE WATER FIX PROJECT OVER TIME -- AS OTHERS HAVE SAID I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE INCUMBENT UPON THIS COMMITTEE. TO CONTINUE THIS HEARING TO ALLOW FOR THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO BE BROUGHT FORTH FROM BY W. D. ARE IN ORDER TO HAVE A FULL CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION AND APPS FOR AWHILE BUT THERE'S MORE TO BE. KNOWN AND THERE'S MORE THAT SHOULD BE KNOWN INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY. AS MISTER MOORE COMMENTED -- RESPONSES. TO COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT RELATED TO THESE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS. AND LET'S LET'S BE CLEAR AND MAKE MONEY NO MISTAKE THAT THESE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS THIS EXTENSION AND SPECIFICALLY THE CHANGES TO THE DEFINITIONS OF WATER SYSTEM FACILITIES. WILL FACILITATE BOND FUNDING. FOR WATER FIX AND I DON'T THINK WE GOT A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE RESPONSE -- FROM. CARLY NAME IS ON THAT POINT AND I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE THIS HEARING SO WE CAN FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT ISSUE AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT [inaudible] THANK YOU. PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF IN ONE MINUTE -- MY NAME IS ROB ANDERSON I'M A RESIDENT SACRAMENTAL YOU COULD PULL THE MIKE DOWN WHAT'S COMFORTABLE FOR YOU [inaudible] OUR EUROPE. COMING DCISION ON THE STATE WATER CONTRACT WILL IMPACT IMPACT TAXPAYERS. AND OUR WATER THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA URGES. TO DELAY THE HEARING AND TELL ALL THE INFORMATION. REGARDING FINANCING IN THE TUNNELS HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND PUBLIC INPUT CAN BE -- TAKEN IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE THAT LEGISLATORS ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION WITHOUT ACCESS. TO CONTRACT AMENDMENTS AND NO IDEA WHAT THE COST IMPACTS WOULD BE. FOR TAXPAYERS AND WATER RATEPAYERS AND PLEASE PUT THE PUBLIC TRUST THE PUBLIC GOOD. AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST FIRST. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M RAY STOKES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL COAST WATER AUTHORITY WE ARE STATE WATER -- WHOLESALER IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY UNLIKE MOST OF THE OTHER STATE WATER PROJECT -- CONTRACTORS WHOSE FOR STATE WATER PROJECT FACILITIES WERE BUILT IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES OURS WERE BUILT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE HIGHER COSTS BECAUSE OF THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. BUT WE'RE ALSO EXPERIENCING THE COMPRESSION ISSUE TODAY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE NORMAL FIFTY YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR OUR FACILITIES. SO WE ARE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT WE DON'T FURTHER EXACERBATE THE FINANCIAL COMPRESSION ISSUES THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY AND COMING HERE I'M IN RECESS. I AM I JENNIFER PIERRE I REPRESENT TWENTY SEVEN OF THE TWENTY NINE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTORS. AND I WANT TO PROVIDE AN EXCERPT FROM A MEMO FROM NAPA COUNTY IS ALSO A MEMBER AND UNABLE TO BE HERE THANK YOU BUT FIRST I WANT TO JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT DURING THE DOESN'T THE PUBLIC MEETINGS THAT WERE HELD. DURING THE CONTRACT EXTENSION NEGOTIATION WITH THE W. ARE ALL TWENTY NINE CONTRACTORS PARTICIPATED SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR -- BUT IN TERMS OF NAPA WHO REPRESENTS ONE OF FIVE CONTRACTORS THAT OCCUR NORTH OF THE DELTA AND WOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM WATER FIX. THEY WRITE THAT -- THE DISTRICT IS AMONG THE SMALLER CONTRACTORS OBTAINS ITS WATER SUPPLY NORTH OF THE DELTA AND WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM OR PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX PROJECT. WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF A COMPLETELY SEPARATE PROCESS. GIVEN ARE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WHAT THE OTHER TWENTY EIGHT CONTRACTORS THAT THE EXTENSION MUST BE APPROVED IN A TIMELY MANNER SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS GLEN TAKEN A RESIDENT OF LOS ANGELES. I SERVE ON THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT BOARD OF DIRECTORS I'M APPOINTED BY LA MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI THAT POST.% I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECOLOGICAL HEALTH OF THE DELTA. AND THERE'S A LOT THAT WE DON'T YET KNOW ABOUT HOW THE NEED TO BALANCE WATER SUPPLY ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED. I SUPPORTED THE PHASED APPROACH FOR THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIGHT FIX IMPROVEMENT TO THE STATE WATER PROJECTS I SUPPORTED THE PROJECT WHEN IT WAS. TWO TUNNELS BUT HAD PARTNERS. MY CONCERN GOES -- TO WHETHER OR NOT LOS ANGELES AND OTHER END OF THE WATER AGENCIES WILL RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE SIX BILLION. OVER INVESTMENT IN THE CAPACITY GPA SECTION OF THE TUNNELS. AND THAT'S NOT YET KNOWN TO US I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE STAFF OF THE MET THE THE METRO ON WARRIORS WHO WILL DO A GREAT JOB. BUT WE DON'T YET KNOW WHETHER NOT THAT'LL BE ACCOMPLISHED THANK YOU [inaudible] WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN CHILL IN THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS THE LAWN KWAN WHAT RESOURCE MANAGER WITH THE LA DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER WE ARE A MISSILE UTILITY. SERVING THE CITY OF LA POPULATION OF AS YOU MAY BE AWARE TO ALSO WE ARE. ONE OF THE ORIGINAL FOUNDING MEMBERS OF METROPOLITAN. SO IN ADDITION TO OUR DISAGREEMENT WITH THEM TO BE DIS OVER INVESTMENT AND THEIR FINANCING OF THE SECOND TUNNEL ALL BY THEMSELVES -- WE MAY ALSO IT IS -- COMING UP HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH HELMET METROPOLITAN MAY RECOVER WATER FIXED COSTS TO THE RATES AND CHARGES. SO AS A CITY -- MAKES ITS PROGRESS TOWARDS -- REDUCING US DEPENDENCE ON MW SUPPLIES THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN CONSERVATION LOCAL PROJECTS. WE BELIEVE THAT METROPOLITAN SHOULD RECOVER -- WATER FIXED COSTS ON A VOLUMETRIC BASIS. AND NOT PASSED ON TO RATE PAYERS IN THE FORM OF A NEW -- FIXED CHARGE. THESE FIXED CHARGES IF THEY'RE IMPOSED -- REPAIRS THAT DO THE RIGHT THING WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET AWAY UNFAIRLY AND AND AND AND UNFAIRLY PAY AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON THE WATER FIXED COST. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THESE FIXED CHARGES ARE -- BAD AND THEY TO SOME DETER INVESTMENTS BY LOCAL AGENCIES TO INVEST IN LOCAL PROJECTS SUCH AS RECYCLE WATER CONSERVATION. AND STORMWATER CAPTURE PROJECTS AS WELL AS A POTENTIALLY IMPACTING THE CITY'S ABILITY TO CLEAN UP -- CONTAMINATION IN SAN FERNANDO GROUNDWATER BASIN. SO IT IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR RATE PAYERS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT ONE METROPOLITAN DOES RECOVER COSTS THAT THEY DO IT -- IN A WAY THAT'S NOT REGRESSIVE. IN THAT THESE COSTS DON'T DIS INCENTIVIZING A LOCAL AGENCIES INVESTMENT ESPECIALLY FOR ASKING THE RATE PAYERS -- TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND REDUCE RELIES ON THE DELTA THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE ONE MINUTE PLEASE.
