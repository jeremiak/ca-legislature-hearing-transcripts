NOT FACILITATE THIS

01:52:57.204 --> 01:53:00.974 region:rollup2

EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS ABOUT

02:31:49.934 --> 02:31:53.938 region:rollup2
MAYBE LOOKING AT WHAT WE DID

02:31:51.336 --> 02:31:56.240 region:rollup2
WITH THAT. GOING AFTER THE

02:31:53.938 --> 02:31:58.810 region:rollup2
SERIAL DUMPERS IN AND USING THE

02:31:56.240 --> 02:32:00.945 region:rollup2
MONEY THAT WE WOULD CHARGE THEM.

02:31:58.810 --> 02:32:02.347 region:rollup2
FOR COMMITTEE KNOW CRIME AND

02:32:00.945 --> 02:32:04.382 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY USE THAT FOR THE

02:32:02.347 --> 02:32:05.617 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF CLEANING UP THE

02:32:04.382 --> 02:32:07.685 region:rollup2
