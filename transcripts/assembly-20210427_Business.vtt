AND EVERY TIME I TALK TO CDA

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.173
WHEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.775
TO DISCUSS. IS TO MAKE SURE

DON'T THINK WE DISAGREE WITH.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:18.333
THE STANDARD THAT'S BEEN SET BY

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.036
UTILIZING THE QUOTA PROCESS IN

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:22.771

ABLE TO PRACTICE IN INDUSTRY

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:41.016
AND ONE OF THE MAIN. TENANTS OF

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:42.350
THE CD AS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:43.985

02:19:41.673 --> 02:19:43.708
THAT THE WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT

02:19:43.775 --> 02:19:45.810
THE BUSINESS OPPOSITION SAYING

02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:46.745
THAT THEY HAVEN'T EVEN READ THE

02:19:46.811 --> 02:19:48.613
AMENDMENTS. WHICH WERE QUITE

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:50.849
SUBSTANTIAL IT IS DISAPPOINTING

02:19:50.915 --> 02:19:54.419
THAT THEY WOULD CALL IN AND

02:19:54.486 --> 02:19:55.520

WOMAN IRWIN DO WISH TO CLOSE I

02:20:04.629 --> 02:20:06.431
I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A FEW OF

02:20:06.498 --> 02:20:09.501
THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP

02:20:09.567 --> 02:20:11.269
FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS THAT

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:14.672
ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS A-

02:20:14.739 --> 02:20:18.443
A CONSTITUTIONAL UP- ISSUES.

02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:20.411
AND THAT WAS ADDRESSED A VERY

02:20:20.478 --> 02:20:22.647
ELOQUENTLY BY THE- COMMITTEE

02:20:22.714 --> 02:20:25.483
STAFF AND- THE BOTTOM LINE IS

02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:26.951
THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE NARROWLY

02:20:27.018 --> 02:20:30.054
TAILORED AND- WE BELIEVE. THAT

02:20:30.121 --> 02:20:33.057
IT IS SECONDLY- WHEN ALL THE

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:36.394
OPPONENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT-

02:20:36.461 --> 02:20:39.330
THAT THIS IS GOING TO- AFFECT

02:20:39.397 --> 02:20:40.632
THEIR BUSINESSES THEY ALSO

02:20:40.698 --> 02:20:41.599
SHOULD REMEMBER THE PROMISE

02:20:41.666 --> 02:20:44.302
THAT THEY MADE WHEN PROP SIXTY

02:20:44.369 --> 02:20:45.336
FOUR PASSED AND IT WAS WRITTEN

02:20:45.403 --> 02:20:48.239
BY. THE OPPONENTS THAT THEY

02:20:48.306 --> 02:20:49.741
WOULD NOT BE MARKETING TO

02:20:49.808 --> 02:20:51.209
CHILDREN AGAIN WE DO NOT NEED

02:20:51.276 --> 02:20:54.312
TO EXPAND. THE LEGAL MARKET ON

02:20:54.379 --> 02:20:58.116
THE BACKS OF. CHILDREN THIRD-

02:20:58.183 --> 02:20:59.350
THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT THIS

02:20:59.417 --> 02:21:01.219
WOULD ONLY ALLOW TOMBSTONE

02:21:01.286 --> 02:21:03.922
TYPE. ADVERTISING I'M NOT SURE

02:21:03.988 --> 02:21:05.490
EXACTLY I ASSUME THAT JUST

02:21:05.557 --> 02:21:07.292
MEANS BLOCK LETTERS LIKE ON A

02:21:07.358 --> 02:21:09.460
TOMBSTONE. BUT THERE ARE PLENTY

02:21:09.527 --> 02:21:11.229
OF THE BILLBOARDS THAT WOULD

02:21:11.296 --> 02:21:12.997
QUALIFY AS A MATTER OF FACT THE

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:15.033
VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD AS

02:21:15.099 --> 02:21:16.034
LONG AS THEY DON'T ADVERTISE

02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:20.205
SPECIFIC. PRODUCTS OR INCLUDE

02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:22.006
DEPICTIONS OF- A MARIJUANA WANT

02:21:22.073 --> 02:21:24.709
TO STOP THE USE THE USE OF

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:26.678
CARTOON CHARACTERS AND OTHER

02:21:26.744 --> 02:21:29.981
ITEMS THAT ARE. OF ENTICING TO

02:21:30.048 --> 02:21:32.483
CHILDREN SINCE THE LEGALIZATION

02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:35.053
OF ADULT USE OF CANNABIS

02:21:35.119 --> 02:21:36.921
THERE'S BEEN AN 18% INCREASE IN

02:21:36.988 --> 02:21:38.756
THE LIKELIHOOD OF LIFETIME USE

02:21:38.823 --> 02:21:41.359

THAT'S WHY BIG TOBACCO DID IT.

02:21:49.234 --> 02:21:50.635
THAT'S WHY THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY

02:21:50.702 --> 02:21:52.503
DID IT AND I THINK IT'S TIME

02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:55.039
FOR SOME- COMMONSENSE RULES TO

02:21:55.106 --> 02:21:57.842
