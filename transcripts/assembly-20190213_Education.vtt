00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.022
AND CREATED UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:38.056
HEALTHCARE AND TO FIND SCHOOL

00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:38.590
DISTRICTS WILL GIVE YOU AN

00:27:38.656 --> 00:27:40.091
EXAMPLE SUCCESS.

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:41.826
BUT THEN I'LL ANSWER THE DIRECT

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:43.228
QUESTION THAT THE MEMBER JUST

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:44.662
BEFORE YES THE CHALLENGES ARE

00:27:44.729 --> 00:27:46.231
STRUCTURAL AND WE WILL NEED

00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:49.834
ACTION. TO CREATE A MUCH BROADER.

00:27:49.901 --> 00:27:50.468
ACCESS TO CARE FOR CHILDREN AND

00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:51.503
YOUTH.

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:52.737
SO --

00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:54.773
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DREAMING

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.007
IN THIS NEXT TWELVE MINUTES AND

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.143
THEN THERE'S A LOT OF DEEP

00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:00.045
MEDICAID FINANCE.

00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:01.546
BUT AT THE HEART OF THIS CHILD

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:02.714
OF THIS NARRATIVE THAT I'M GONNA

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:04.883
GIVE YOU IS THINK A LITTLE BIT

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:05.517
LIKE PEANUT BUTTER PEANUT BUTTER

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:06.251
AND CHOCOLATE.

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:07.385
THE NEXUS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:09.020
PUBLIC EDUCATION IS RIGHT AND

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:10.855
GOOD AND REAL.

00:28:10.922 --> 00:28:12.323
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.526
PUTTING BEFORE OUR LOCAL CHILD

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:17.128
SERVING SEEKING THAT'S ARE TOO

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.064
SIGNIFICAN TO BE OVERCOME.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.631
GIVEN THE CURRENT RESOURCES

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:21.332
AVAILABLE.

00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:22.934
AND BY WAY OF LEGITIMATION.

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:24.836
I BEGAN MY CAREER.

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:25.637
AS A THERAPIST IN THE OAKLAND

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.005
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.540
I WORKED AS AN EMERGENCY ROOM

00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:29.941
SOCIAL WORKER CHILDREN'S OAKLAND.

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:31.509
AND THEN I LET ONE OF THE

00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:32.444
STATE'S LARGEST CHILDREN'S

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.378
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AS THE

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:34.712
HEALTH DIRECTOR NAMI TO COUNTY

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:36.581
FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS.

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:38.583
SO YOU CAN'T NAME A MEDICAID

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:39.217
REVENUE STREAM THAT I HAVEN'T

00:28:39.284 --> 00:28:40.218
BUILT.

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:41.619
I PERSONALLY BILLS TENS OF

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:42.887
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DE PST

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:44.589
MEDICARE MEDICAID.

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:45.523
I'VE RUN AFTER HE SEES I'VE

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.460
WORKED IN HOSPITALS I STARTED --

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:49.561
SEKHEMRE CHEESE PORTIONS OF A

00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:51.629
HOME CHILD WELFARE SO WHAT I'M

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:52.297
GONNA AMOUNT OF TIME BUT ANY OF

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:53.832
THAT BUT I HOPE YOU CAN FEEL

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:54.599
BEHIND THE SLIDES ABOUT TO SHOW

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:55.333
YOU.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.734
A LOTOF EXPERIENCE WITH PUBLIC

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:59.337
I'M INTERESTING.

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:02.907
DOING STUFF THAT.

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:04.275
SO I AS QUICK EVIDENCE OF THE

00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:06.311
CRISIS I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE DATA

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:06.878
THAT WAS PUT FORWARD IN YOUR

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:08.346
OPENING COMMENTS --

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:09.614
BUT IT'S REAL SOMETHING'S

00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:10.615
HAPPENING WITH KIDS WERE NOT

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.684
MAKING IT UP THERE'S BEEN A 50%

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.119
INCREASE IN HOSPITAL DAYS FOR

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:16.454
TERMS NOT HEALTH BETWEEN TWO

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:18.056
THOUSAND SIX IN.

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:18.656
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN NOW WHY

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:19.257
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT IS ACROSS

00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:21.659
THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE SPECTRUM

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.328
LENGTH OF STAY MEANING DAYS

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:24.362
SPENT IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:27.031
ACROSS ALL DISEASE BURDENS HAS

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.933
DECREASED BY ABOUT 30%.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.969
ONLY IN ONE AREA HAS INCREASED.

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:33.771
TURNS ON HEALTH.

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:35.206
AND THE THE COMMENTS THAT WERE

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:36.608
MADE INITIALLY ABOUT A SUICIDE

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:39.144
SUICIDE IN THE LAST DECADE.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.579
HAS LEAPFROGGED CANCER AND CAR

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:43.781
WRECKS AS A CAUSE OF DEATH.

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:45.350
SO GRATEFUL HERE THE DETAIL --

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.886
NEVER MIND ABOUT AT YOUR

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:48.419
UNDERSTANDING OF THE SWISS

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:49.020
ACADEMIC.

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:50.488
HE'S EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CHANGES ARE

00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:51.656
MASSIVE.

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.191
AND THEY'RE GOING UNDER REPORTED.

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:54.926
ON NAMES WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.295
USE NOT A HEALTH CRISIS BY ANY

00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:59.164
STANDARD MEASUREMENT.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.166
I SELF INJURY JUST DEFINED BY

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:03.334
CUTTING SELF MUTILATION SUICIDE

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.103
ATTEMPTS TWO SENATE TEMPTED SELF

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.871
INJURY IS UP OVER A 100%.

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:07.505
AND WE'RE SPENDING OVER ELEVEN

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:10.108
POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS.

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:12.277
THE HARSH HARD REALITY IS THAT

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:14.012
MOST CHILDREN IN OUR SYSTEM GET

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:15.947
NO SUPPORT AND THOSE WHO DO GET

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:16.781
IT.

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:19.551
GET THE WRONG KIND TOO LATE.

00:30:19.617 --> 00:30:21.286
OUR CURRENT MODEL SAYS THAT YOU

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:22.387
HAVE TO MEET WHAT WE CALL

00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:23.955
MEDICAL DEBT A NEST NECESSITY TO

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.089
GET ACCESS TO CARE ENOUGH TO

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:27.225
HAVE A DIAGNOSIS.

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:27.759
BUT IF YOU GO BACK TO THE

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:30.295
ORIGINS OF THE MEDICAID MANDATE

00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:31.362
FOR MENTAL HEALTH.

00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:33.131
GIVE TO GO BACK TO NINETEEN

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:33.665
SIXTY SEVEN IN THE SOCIAL

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:34.732
SECURITY ACT.

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.267
AS A QUICK HISTORY LESSON.

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:39.671
IN 196740% OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO

00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:41.172
SHOWED UP FOR THE VIETNAM DRAFT.

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:43.541
WERE UNFIT TO SERVE COULD MAKE

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:44.776
IT AROUND THE TRACK COULDN'T GET

00:30:44.842 --> 00:30:46.010
OVER A FOOT BARRIER.

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:47.078
THUS WAS BORN ONE OF OUR

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:48.112
NATION'S MOST SUCCESSFUL

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:51.149
EXPERIMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH.

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:52.917
THIS CALL THE T. P. STT MANDATE

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:54.185
AND WHAT IS SAID IS THAT ALL

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:55.453
CHILDREN IN MEDICAID.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.287
GET EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:57.956
THRIVE.

00:30:58.022 --> 00:30:58.523
AND YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE THE

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.825
MUSICIANS. 90% OF LOW INCOME

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:03.127
CHILDREN GET THEIR MUSIC BUT

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:04.362
WHAT WE DON'T WE ALSO KNOW ABOUT

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.863
MEDICAID OR MENTAL HEALTH IS

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.332
THAT ONLY 4% OF CHILDREN GET A

00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:09.100
MEDICAL SERVICE.

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:10.401
THE BARRIERS TO GETTING ACCESS

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:11.936
TO CARE ARE LARGELY BECAUSE OF

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.271
THESE ISSUES REGARDING MEDICAL

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:15.940
NECESSITY WE REQUIRE CHILDREN TO

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:17.275
MEET IN ON A REASONABLE STANDARD.

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:18.576
TO GET ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEM THEY

00:31:18.643 --> 00:31:19.811
HAVE TO FILL INTO IT TO GET

00:31:19.877 --> 00:31:22.313
ACCESS TO CARE.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.715
SO SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN THERE'S

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:24.983
BEEN A 20% INCREASE THE NUMBER

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:26.484
OF CHILDREN IN MEDICAID ANOTHER

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.486
POORLY UNDERSTOOD THING. THREE

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:30.421
MAJOR POLICY DRIVERS LED TO THIS

00:31:30.488 --> 00:31:31.856
20% INCREASE.

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:32.590
THE INCLUSION OF THE

00:31:32.657 --> 00:31:34.192
UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FULL

00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:36.127
SCOPE MEDICAID SB.

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:36.594
SEVENTY FIVE THE ROMAN

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:38.062
ELIGIBILITY EFFORTS OF THE ACA

00:31:38.129 --> 00:31:39.530
WE BROUGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:41.699
WERE PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE OUT.

00:31:41.766 --> 00:31:43.735
AND THE RULING IN THE VESTIAN.

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.470
MEANING THAT NOW ALL CHILDREN

00:31:45.536 --> 00:31:47.672
UNDER 2100% OF CHILDREN 50% OF

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:49.741
OUR PARTY QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID.

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:50.942
SO JUST THINK FOR SECOND THAT'S

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:52.744
OVER SIX MILLION OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.245
TEN MILLION CHILDREN.

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:57.348
ARE FEDERALLY ENTITLED. TO ALL

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:58.349
THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO

00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:00.718
PREVENT HARM.

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:02.086
ONLY 4% ARE GETTING ON OUR

00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:02.620
CURRENT MEDICAID THE WHOLE

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:06.758
SYSTEM --

00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.426
THAT'S AT LAST BLUEPRINT THE

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:09.627
BOTTOM -- SO

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:10.295
THIS DATA JUST QUICKLY SHOWS YOU

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.429
THAT THE SAME BENEFIT THAT

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:12.263
COVERS ACCIDENTS RIGHT THAT SAME

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.265
NUMBER I GAVE YOU 90% OF KIDS

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:15.900
GET THEIR AMOUNT AND I'M IN OUR

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.969
SHUTTLE TIME.

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:19.637
THE ONLY 4% OF GETTING MANY

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:20.872
OTHER MEDICAID NOW SERVICE.

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:21.906
OUR SYSTEM BY ANY STANDARD

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:24.776
MEASURES BROKEN.

00:32:24.842 --> 00:32:26.244
AND WE CAN'T DO IT THROUGH

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:27.278
HOSPITALS.

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:28.479
OR THROUGH CLINICS THAT'S WHY I

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.314
SAY THE MEDICAL MODEL IS NOT THE

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.115
ANSWER. 75% OF MENTAL ILLNESS

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:33.818
MANIFESTS BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:34.686
TWENTY FOUR BUT FOURTEEN AND

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:35.286
TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS HAVE THE

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:36.521
LOWEST RATE OF HEALTH CARE

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:37.355
UTILIZATION OF ANY

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:39.257
DEMOGRAPHICALLY.

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:40.858
SOME TALKING US INTO WHY SCHOOLS

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:42.260
ARE SO ESSENTIAL.

00:32:42.327 --> 00:32:43.861
SCHOOLS ARE THE CLINIC OF THE

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.830
FUTURE FOR TEENS.

00:32:45.897 --> 00:32:46.898
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HURTS

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.499
YOUNG PEOPLE THEIR MOBILITY

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:49.467
FACTORS WHAT TAKES THEM TO THE

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:51.135
HOSPITAL IT'S ALMOST ALL

00:32:51.202 --> 00:32:52.470
BEHAVIORAL IN NATURE?

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:54.906
LOCAL YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY.

00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:55.473
WHAT THEY NEED IS BEHAVIORAL

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.809
SUPPORT AND THE PLACE TO GET IT

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.444
TO HIM IS SCHOOLS --

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.445
THE REST OF THE DAY ON THE SLIDE

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:01.346
JUST SHOWS YOU THE PROVIDER

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:02.714
SHORTAGE CHALLENGES WE HAVE YOU

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.415
CAN'T DO IT THROUGH TRADITIONAL

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:05.516
MEDICAL MODELS.

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:08.353
SCHOOLS ARE PERFECT PLACE TO

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:10.488
DELIVER THE SERVICES.

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:12.824
AS A QUICK EXAMPLE WHILE I WAS

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:13.391
THE HEALTH DIRECTOR ON THE

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:14.792
ACCOUNTING WE DID ONE OF THE

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.260
MOST THE LARGEST EXPANSIONS OF

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:16.794
CHILDREN AND HEALTH IN THE

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:17.995
STATE'S HISTORY --

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:18.963
WE'RE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.966
MILLION PEOPLE FOR FOR FOURTEEN

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:23.101
SCHOOL DISTRICTS FIVE SELFLESS.

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.035
AND JUST A QUICKLY TAKE YOU

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:25.770
THROUGH THIS EXPANSION.

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.438
IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:28.539
ONE WE HAD ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:32.143
KIDS IN OUR SYSTEM WEAK CHRIS --

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.710
TO TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND I'M

00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:33.344
ABOUT TO TELL THE STORY NOT TO

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:35.213
SUGGEST IT'S A BLUEPRINT FOR THE

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.180
FUTURE BECAUSE WE HAD SOME

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:37.415
THINGS ALAMEDA COUNTY THAT MOST

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.517
COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE.

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:40.818
PROVIDER BASE IN A GROUP OF

00:33:40.885 --> 00:33:41.986
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:44.055
READY WILLING AND COMPETENT TO

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:46.157
SERVE.

00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:47.392
WE HAD A PROGRESSIVE BOARD

00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:48.693
SUPERVISORS WHO HAD ACCESS TO

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.328
ASSESSMENT REVENUE LOCAL SALES

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:52.397
TAX ON TOBACCO REVENUE SO THINGS

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:53.965
THAT MOST COUNTIES DON'T HAVE.

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:55.266
BUT I'M I WANT TO TELL THE STORY

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:57.101
BECAUSE IT CAN BE DONE WITH WILL

00:33:57.168 --> 00:33:58.503
AND RESOURCES MOST COUNTIES

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.605
DON'T HAPPEN THOUGH.

00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:01.973
IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE HAD

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:02.874
FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.909
IN TWO THOUSAND WE HAD EIGHT IN

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:05.977
TWO THOUSAND FOR WE HAVE TWELVE

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:07.612
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAVE.

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:08.579
FOURTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:09.847
HAVE NINETEEN IN TWO THOUSAND

00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:11.916
TWELVE WE HAD TWENTY SIX IN TWO

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:13.084
THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE HAD TWENTY

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:15.420
NINE AND CAN CURRENTLY WE OPENED

00:34:15.486 --> 00:34:16.421
TWO HUNDRED SCHOOL BASED MENTAL

00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:17.889
HEALTH PROGRAMS.

00:34:17.955 --> 00:34:18.890
IN OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:20.258
DISTRICT WE CREATED THE FIRST

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:21.859
MAJOR URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:23.294
UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO PHYSICAL OR

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:25.062
MENTAL HEALTH ON EVERY MIDDLE

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:26.164
SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.731
THERE'S A CLINICIAN IN EVERY

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.399
SCHOOL.

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:30.802
AGAIN THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:31.569
THE BLUEPRINT BECAUSE WHAT WE

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:32.804
ADDED THOSE TEN THOUSAND

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:33.938
CHILDREN TO CARE WE REQUIRED

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:35.940
EACH ONE OF THEM HAD A DIAGNOSIS

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:37.308
TO GET ACCESS TO CARE.

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:38.342
AND I CAN TELL YOU HAVING

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:39.744
REPRESENTED A VERY SMALL CHUNK

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:41.179
OF THOSE TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN.

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:42.980
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE KIDS I

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:44.949
SERVE WE'RE NOT PATHOLOGICAL.

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:47.218
THE REGION WITH ADVERSITY.

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:47.685
THEY'RE DOING WITH THE

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:48.519
CHALLENGES OF GROWING UP.

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:49.887
SO WE NEED TO RE WORK OUR SYSTEM

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:50.955
SO MORE KIDS ARE QUALIFIED

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:52.089
INELIGIBLE.

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:53.391
AND ENSURE THE RESOURCES IN

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:55.026
FINANCING ARE AVAILABLE AT

00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.694
LARGELY AT SCHOOL SETTINGS.

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:57.829
OF THOSE TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:59.730
WE ADDED TO CARE OUR SYSTEM

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:03.134
THROUGH SCHOOLS.

00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:04.602
SO JUST TO CLOSE WHERE I THINK

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:05.636
THE REFORM SYSTEM NEEDS TO GO

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:07.738
ALSO TO GIVE ACCESS TO THE TYPE

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:09.574
OF DOLLARS AND EXPERTISE THAT

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.142
SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED WE NEED TO

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:12.810
MAKE SOME FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS.

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.212
TO OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:16.047
AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT'S WHY I

00:35:16.113 --> 00:35:17.648
ASK FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT.

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:19.517
THE FIRST WE HAVE TO MAXIMIZE

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:21.385
FEDERAL LEVEL FEDERAL REVENUE.

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:22.987
CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY EIGHT IN

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:24.489
THE NATION AND SPENDING FOR

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:26.457
MEDICAID BENEFICIARY.

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.159
A SET ONE MORE TIME CALIFORNIA

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:30.027
RANKS FORTY EIGHT IN THE NATION

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.796
AND SPENDING.

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:32.730
THE FIN FIN YEAR OF

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:34.098
PROGRESSIVENESS OF OUR STATE

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:35.399
EVAPORATES QUICKLY WHEN YOU LOOK

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.235
AT WHAT KIDS ACTUALLY GET.

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:38.636
SO WE NEED TO BRING IN NEW

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:39.971
FEDERAL REVENUE.

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:41.005
THROUGH SOMETHING CALLED A STATE

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:41.873
PLAN AMENDMENT I WON'T GO INTO

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:43.007
DETAILS HERE BUT CLEARLY

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:44.208
MAXIMIZING FEDERATION IS

00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:45.409
ESSENTIAL THE STATE CAN'T FOR

00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:46.410
THE BILL.

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:47.778
WE HAVE TO BROADEN ACCESS TO

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:49.213
SERVICES MEANING WE HAVE TO

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.948
THINK ABOUT THE THINGS WE DO AS

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:52.149
BEYOND JUST A FIFTY MINUTE

00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:54.118
THERAPEUTIC SESSION.

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:55.686
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF HERE'S WHAT

00:35:55.753 --> 00:35:56.687
ARE THE ROLES OF PARA PARTNERS

00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:58.723
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF EXTENDERS OR

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:00.658
NON TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS OF

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:02.026
BEHAVIOR HEALTH SUPPORTS?

00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:02.660
THE TRADITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:04.795
SYSTEM HAS A LOT TO LEARN FROM

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:06.097
THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY.

00:36:06.163 --> 00:36:07.365
TONIGHT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE GET

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:08.399
TOGETHER BOUND ONLY BY THE

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:10.301
COMMON EXPERIENCE OF SUFFERING.

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:11.769
WHERE IS THE SOCIAL MODEL FOR

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:13.938
BEING YOUNG AND BROWN IN OAKLAND

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:14.572
FOR BEING A NEW MOTHER FOR BEING

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:15.740
A RECENT IMMIGRANT?

00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:16.807
WE NEED TO THINK OF OUR MEDICAL

00:36:16.874 --> 00:36:18.242
SYSTEM IS BEYOND JUST A CLINICAL

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.344
SUPPORT BUT AS A BROAD SOCIAL

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:22.680
MOVEMENT TO BUILD SOCIAL CAPITAL.

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:23.314
AND FINALLY HAVE TO PURCHASE HOW

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:24.715
WE PAY.

00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:25.850
AS THE HEALTH DIRECTOR SAT ON

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:27.852
THE BOARD OF HEALTH PLAN.

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:28.886
WE SERVE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:29.620
MEMBERS.

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:31.989
WE HAD EIGHT FINANCE STUFF.

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.991
THE MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:34.792
THAT I AM HELPED A MINISTER OR

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:35.259
LEAD.

00:36:35.326 --> 00:36:37.328
WE SERVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:37.962
PEOPLE WE HAD A HUNDRED FINANCE

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:38.696
STUFF.

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.064
THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:42.567
COUNTIES ARE BEING ASKED TO BEAR.

00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:44.068
TO ADMINISTER THESE DOLLARS IS

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:45.536
SO MUCH GREATER ON THE BEHAVIOR

00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:46.370
OUTSIDE THAT IS ON THE PHYSICAL

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:48.072
HEALTH SIDE WE HAVE TO CHANGE

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:50.041
HOW DOLLARS FLOW FROM THE STATE.

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:51.509
TO COUNTIES TO MAKE IT MORE

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:53.477
STREAMLINED AND TO EXPAND ACCESS

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.946
TO REVENUE.

00:36:55.012 --> 00:36:56.914
AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS HUGE BUT

00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:57.548
THAT'S THE WAY SCHOOLS WILL GET

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:58.849
WHAT THEY NEED.

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:00.618
IS BY TRANSFORMING HOW THE STATE

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:03.321
ADMINISTERS ITS MEDICAID PROGRAM.

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:05.856
SO MY LAST SLIDE IS WE HAVE NEW

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:07.758
SCIENCE AND EMERGING PRACTICES.

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:09.060
SO TOUCH ANYTHING BUT HARRIS IS

00:37:09.126 --> 00:37:09.860
JOINING THE LEADERSHIP OF THE

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:12.296
STATE WE ARE NOW UNDERSTANDING

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:13.564
THE IMPACT OF ADVERSITY ON

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:14.865
HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT.

00:37:14.932 --> 00:37:16.400
WHY ISN'T ADVERSITY THE

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:18.169
TRIGGERING ABOUT FROM A WHOLE

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:20.204
SERVICE NOT PATHOLOGY?

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:21.706
RIGHT BUT TOUGH THINGS HAPPEN TO

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:23.107
YOU IF YOU NEED SUPPORT.

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:23.908
THEY'RE STRIKING EVIDENCE OF A

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:24.542
CRISIS YOU ALREADY KNEW IT THANK

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:26.477
YOU FOR YOUR DATA.

00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:27.845
THERE IS AN ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:29.180
WE HAVE DRAMATIC INCREASING%

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:31.082
COSTS IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM

00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:32.717
FOR CHILDREN A MENTAL HEALTH.

00:37:32.783 --> 00:37:33.851
AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A WAY TO

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.486
FINANCE REFORM BY CLEANING

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:37.488
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REVENUE ON

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:39.557

STRUGGLING TO HELP STUDENTS

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.028
ACADEMICALLY WHEN THEIR NEEDS

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:51.929
WHAT'S GETTING IN THE WAY OF

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:53.597
THEIR ACADEMICS ARE NOT ACADEMIC

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:54.331
ISSUES.

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:55.533
BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES THEIR

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:57.034
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE HEAR

00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:59.637
FROM TEACHERS WHO WANT TO

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:01.205
RESPOND BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW.

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.006
WE DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:03.274
PROGRAMS IN PLACE FOR THE

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.810
STRATEGIES IN PLACE.

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:06.644
QUITE OFTEN WE GET ASK WELL

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:08.446
HOW'S CALIFORNIA DOING IN THIS

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:09.880
REGARD AND I AND I WOULD I

00:39:09.947 --> 00:39:11.315
ALWAYS START OFF WITH A LITTLE

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:12.083
BIT OF HOPE.

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:14.018
THE MIDDLE HOW SERVICES ACT HAS

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:14.952
A COUPLE OF COMPONENTS HERE THAT

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.654
ARE VERY EXPLICIT.

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:18.122
UNDER A PREVENTION STATEMENT IN

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.757
THE MAIL HOW SERVICES ACT THAT

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:21.358
INCLUDES A STATEMENT ABOUT

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:23.094
REDUCING SCHOOL FAILURE.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.695
THE STATE RECEIVES BETWEEN THREE

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:25.529
HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND FOUR

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:26.163
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.398
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOING

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:29.300
TOWARDS PREVENTION KINDS OF

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:29.900
ACTIVITIES.

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:31.969
THAT SAYS PREVENTING SCHOOL

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:32.670
FAILURE IS ONE OF OUR CLEAR

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:33.504
GOALS.

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:35.439
WE ALSO HAVE LANGUAGE IN THE LAW

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:36.907
THAT SAYS COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:37.908
TO BE INNOVATIVE AND YOU'VE

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:39.343
HEARD A LOT I THINK IN THE PAST

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.911
COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT HOW.

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:42.279
COUNTIES ARE ARE OR ARE NOT

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:43.948
SPENDING FUNDS EITHER IN THEIR

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:46.150
PREVENTION SIDE OF THE

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.084
RENOVATION SIDE.

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.385
THE REAL ISSUE HERE I THINK IS

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:50.354
THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS IN

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:52.356
CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:53.557
ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:55.426
MISTER BRISCOE HAS HIGHLIGHTED.

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:57.561
WE ALSO HAVE HOPE IN THAT WE

00:39:57.628 --> 00:39:59.396
HAVE PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS THE

00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:01.398
STATE IT ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR

00:40:01.465 --> 00:40:02.933
EXAMPLE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR LATER

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.869
TODAY FROM AMY MILLER FROM

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:06.704
MONTEREY COUNTY WE WERE ABLE TO

VISIT SOME OF HER PROGRAMS.

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:09.373
WE'RE SEEING PROGRAMS IN

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.942
MONTEREY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:13.677
IN THE BAY AREA THAT ARE SHOWING

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:15.246
TREMENDOUS PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:16.347
SCHOOLS.

00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:18.149
AND THEY'RE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:20.017
PARTNERS FRESNO IS RECENTLY

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:21.552
INVESTING IN AT A HUNDRED

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.120
MILLION DOLLARS TO TRY TO DO

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:24.622
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:24.822
WHAT.

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.457
ALAMEDA COUNTY IS DOING.

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:27.591
BUT WE SEE SOME FUNDAMENTAL

00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:30.361
CHALLENGES AND WE WE SEE THAT

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:33.097
QUITE OFTEN THE EXAMPLES OF THE

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:35.699
ALAMEDA OR THE MONORAIL OR

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.268
SALMON YOU KNOW RIVERSIDE.

00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:39.436
OFTEN ARE WORKING UPSTREAM THE

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:40.704
STATE MAKES IT OFTEN VERY

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.239
DIFFICULT I I THINK YOU'LL HEAR

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:42.940
FROM.

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:44.375
DOCTOR MILLER AROUND THE

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:45.843
CHALLENGES THE WRIST THAT SHE

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.578
TAKES IN TRYING TO DESIGN A

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:49.346
STRATEGY THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:50.681
THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN HER

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:53.117
SCHOOLS.

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.051
WHAT?

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:54.952
WE ARE DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.453
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT WE'RE

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.621
TRYING TO CREATE AND THERE'S I

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:58.589
THINK WE'VE GIVEN YOU A LIST OF

00:40:58.656 --> 00:40:59.657
SOME OF THOSE THINGS.

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:00.524
WERE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:03.661
HEALTH CARE SIR EDUCATION TO SEE

00:41:03.727 --> 00:41:05.029
IF WE COULD LINK EDUCATION DATA

00:41:05.095 --> 00:41:06.697
AND MENTAL HEALTH DATA TO REALLY

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.065
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN PLACE TODAY

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.067
UNDERSTAND HOW.

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.735
ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:12.937
IS SUPPORTING EDUCATIONAL

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:14.872
OUTCOMES WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:16.106
LEARNING COLLABORATIVE'S ACROSS

00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:17.408
COUNTIES WHEN WE TALKED COUNTY

00:41:17.474 --> 00:41:19.076
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS. ONE

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:19.677
OF THE NUMBER ONE THING STILL

00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:21.345
TELL US IS THEY HAVE A VERY HARD

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:22.947
TIME FINDING OUT WHAT EVERYBODY

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.215
ELSE IS DOING.

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:25.716
IN A VERY HARD TIME FINDING OUT

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:27.418
HOW TO DO THE THINGS THAT THEY

00:41:27.484 --> 00:41:29.053
WANT TO GET DONE SO EVEN WHEN WE

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:30.354
HAVE LEADERSHIP AND SOME OF

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:31.655
THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WANT TO

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.357
TACKLE THESE ISSUES.

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:34.758
IT FEELS OVERWHELMING.

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:36.227
PART OF THAT FOR THE FOR THE

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:37.595
COMMISSION IS WE'RE WE'RE

00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.163
THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES IN A

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.564
NUMBER OF WAYS AND I'VE OUTLINED

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.800
SOME OF THAT IN MY TESTIMONY.

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:43.901
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE SEE IS

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:45.202
MENTAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS FALLS

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:46.270
BETWEEN SOME OF THE

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.072
ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN THAT WE

00:41:48.138 --> 00:41:49.373
HAVE IN STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.808
HAVE THE PART OF EDUCATION THEY

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:51.775
HAVE A ROLE WE HAVE THE

00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:52.776
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:54.411
THEY HAVE A ROLE THE COMMISSION

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:55.880
HAS A ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:57.014
PUBLIC HEALTH HAS A ROLE.

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:58.515
THE OFFICE OF HEALTH INFORMATION

00:41:58.582 --> 00:42:00.684
INTEGRITY HAS A ROLE IN TERMS OF

00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:01.986
SOME OF THE LEGAL --

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:03.654
BARRIERS THAT GET IN THE WAY OF

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:05.589
OF INFORMATION SHARING AND

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:06.290
COLLABORATION ACROSS THIS

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:08.792
COUNTIES ORGANIZATIONALLY.

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:10.461
WE'RE NOT SEEING THE STATE BE

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:12.563
THAT CHAMPION TO HELP COUNTIES

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.098
UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR SCHOOL

00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:15.733
PARTNERS WHAT THEY CAN DO HOW TO

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:18.269
DO IT AND AND IN WAYS THAT ARE

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:19.770
COST EFFECTIVE RIDE.

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:21.338
THIS THIS SOME OF THE COMMENTS

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:22.139
THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM DIRECTORS

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.474
YOU'LL HEAR LATER SAY I HOPE

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:25.175
ABOUT HAVING TO SWIM UPSTREAM.

00:42:25.242 --> 00:42:26.710
IT CAN BE TWICE AS DIFFICULT TO

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:28.245
DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE SYSTEM

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:30.414
THAT WE HAVE AND I THINK THAT'S

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:31.415
ONE OF THE MESSAGES AT LEAST I

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:33.284
HERE.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.818
IN MISTER BRISCOE'S TESTIMONY.

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.320
CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.655
TO LEVERAGE THE TRUST AND

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.490
RESPECT THAT FAMILIES HAVE FOR

00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:40.224
THEIR SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:41.892
TEACHERS.

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:43.627
WHEN WE TALK WITH CONSUMERS AND

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.429
FAMILY MEMBERS QUITE OFTEN THAT

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.364
TRUST BECAUSE OF STIGMA ISN'T

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:48.332
THERE WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:49.133
SYSTEM?

00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:51.702
IN SOME CASES A VERY CLEARLY YES

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:52.770
BUT WE'VE HEARD FROM FAMILIES

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:54.238
WHO SAID I'D BE HAPPY TO GO TO

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:56.440
MY SCHOOL TO ACCESS SERVICES I'D

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:57.975
BE HAPPY TO ASK MY NEIGHBOR TO

00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:59.643
GIVE ME A RIDE THIS IS AN ACTUAL

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.378
STORY FROM MONTEREY.

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:02.313
HAVE A FAMILY THAT DIDN'T HAVE A

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:03.948
CAR THAT WAS RECEIVING SERVICES

00:43:04.014 --> 00:43:05.449
TO THE SCHOOL AND THEY'RE ABOUT

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:07.651
TO SAY COULD YOU GIVE MY MYSELF

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:08.986

SCHOOL ACTIVITY LOT OF PRIDE AND

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:15.059
TRUST AND RESPECT THEIR WHERE

00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:16.860
THEY WOULD NEVER SAY I NEED A

00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:18.629
RIDE TO A MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:19.830
BECAUSE OF STIGMA.

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:21.198
PARTICULARLY IN AND CULTURAL

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:24.335
COMMUNITIES NOT YET FIGURED OUT

00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:26.370
HOW TO SUPPORT THE OPPORTUNITY

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:27.638
TO LEVERAGE THE RELATIONSHIP

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:28.739
BETWEEN OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.641
HEALTH SYSTEMS AND OUR SCHOOLS.

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:31.809
IN WAYS THAT YOU'RE SEEING IN

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:33.510
ALAMEDA SO WE SEE THESE POCKETS

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:35.879
OF EXCELLENCE BUT MOVING THOSE

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:37.681
LESSONS FROM A AND AN

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:39.183
EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE IN A

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:41.118
PLACE AT A POINT IN TIME.

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:42.453
INTO A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE FOR

00:43:42.519 --> 00:43:43.721
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN VERY

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.089
DIFFICULT.

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:46.390
THE FISCAL INCENTIVES ARE

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.659
MISALIGNED INFORMATIONAL

00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:49.893
INCENTIVES ARE MISSION LA I

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.028
MISALIGNED.

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:51.962
A GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE IT

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:53.464
HIGHLIGHTED IN MY TESTIMONY IN

MY FAMILY I HAVE AND MY COUSIN

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.369
HAS A CHILD WHO WAS STRUGGLING

00:43:58.435 --> 00:43:59.703
TO GET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.105
AND WAS TOLD TO WAIT UNTIL HE

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:02.506
WAS ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIAL

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:04.842
EDUCATION SERVICES.

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:06.744
THE HE WAS THE MY FAMILY WAS

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.479
SORT OF PUSHED IN BETWEEN THE

00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:11.882
SCHOOLS AND THE COUNTY WITH BOTH

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:13.550
SIDES SAYING THAT'S NOT MY MY

00:44:13.617 --> 00:44:15.219
RESPONSIBILITY YET.

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:16.787
LET'S WAIT FOR THIS CHALLENGE TO

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:19.323
GET WORSE TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.190
ONE OF THE MESSAGES IN MISTER

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:21.558
BRISCOE'S TESTIMONY TO GET MORE

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:22.659
EXPENSIVE.

00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:25.062
UNTIL WE CAN'T AVOID RESPONDING

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:26.096
WE REALLY NEED TO TURN THAT

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:27.631
AROUND.

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:29.233
WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT BY

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:31.168
SUPPORTING COUNTIES IN TERMS OF

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:31.568

YEARS AND WHAT WE LEARNED IS YOU

SO IN EVERYONE OF THOSE TWO

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:20.264
HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PROGRAMS

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.365
THAT I'M OUT FOR YOU.

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:22.165
THERE IS WHAT'S CALLED A

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.300
COORDINATION OF SERVICE TEAM

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:24.635
MEETING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN EVERY

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:26.536
WEEK IT'S GONNA COST TEAM SOME

00:48:26.603 --> 00:48:27.938
JURISDICTIONS CALL CARE TEAM.

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:29.172
BUT WHAT IT IS IS A DEFINED

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:31.174
PROTOCOL FOR THE IDENTIFICATION

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.709

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:33.877
TO SUPPORT.

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.545
THAT'S NOT JUST THE WISDOM AND

00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:36.680
SKILL OF A PARTICULAR COUNSELOR.

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:39.116
SO THERE IS A SPECIFIC PROTOCOL

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:42.919
FOR HOW PART OF THE CONTRACT.

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:44.488
BETWEEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE

00:48:44.554 --> 00:48:46.423
COUNTY AND THE PROVIDER.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.958
SO TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION IN

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:49.860
ALAMEDA COUNTY WE USED A

00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:51.728
PURCHASED OR PROCURED MODEL.

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:52.629
MEANING WE WOULD WORK WITH A

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:53.597
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:55.499
LIKE A SENECA A LINK IN FRENCH

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:57.501
FRENCH AND EAST BAY AGENCY FOR

00:48:57.567 --> 00:48:58.368
CHILDREN.

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:00.203
A NONPROFIT ENTITY THAT WAS

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.706
CONTRACTED. TO THE MEDICAID

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:05.609
AGENCY WHICH IN THE COUNTY IS

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:06.877
THE PAPER OUT THE PARK.

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.111
SO THE SUGGESTION I WOULD MAKE

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:09.279
IS THAT IN MANY COUNTIES THE WAY

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:12.282
TO DO THIS IS TO WORK WITH A TRY

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:13.817
PIE CHART TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT.

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:14.484
THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:15.886
AUTHORITY YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:17.521
AND YOUR PROVIDER.

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:18.355
NOW THERE ARE MANY JURISDICTIONS

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:19.690
WHERE THE PROVIDERS IS NOT EXIST

00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:21.425
IN THAT CASE THE DISTRICT HAS TO

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:22.426
BECOME THE PROVIDER.

00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:24.127
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU GET

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:25.662
THERE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT WAYS

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:26.897
TO DO IT --

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:27.964
AND NEITHER ONE'S OWN YOU KNOW

00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:30.033
BOTH WORK --

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.034
BUT THE DETAILS OF THE OPERATION

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:31.835
ARE YOU HAVE TO DEFINEYOUR

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:32.736
REFERRAL PROTOCOL YOU HAVE TO

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:33.403
HAVE A COST TEAM.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.404
AND WHAT WE SAID IS YOU HAVE TO

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:36.406
BE ON CAMPUS FULL TIME SO NO

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:37.407
DROP AND THERAPISTS LIKE IT TO

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:40.711
BE THERE ALL THE TIME.

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:42.346
SO MANY QUESTIONS REAL QUICK ON

00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:43.347
THAT ONE DAY.

00:49:43.413 --> 00:49:45.582
SO -- SIX

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:46.149
FIVE HUNDRED TO UNDER FIFTY

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:52.255
AT LEAST.

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:53.156
ONE IN FACT WHAT I WOULD SAY

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:54.458
FROM A PANEL PERSPECTIVE FOR SO

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:55.425
IT THE FINANCING DEPENDS ON THE

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:56.193
NUMBER OF THOSE KIDS THAT ARE

00:49:56.259 --> 00:49:57.127
MEDICAID ELIGIBLE BECAUSE

00:49:57.194 --> 00:49:59.529
THERE'S A FINANCING REALITY

00:49:59.596 --> 00:49:59.996
RIGHT YOU GOT TO HAVE.

00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:01.231
A PAIR.

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:02.666
SO -- IF IF

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:03.600
IF THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED MEDICAID

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:05.135

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:06.370
YOU SHOULD GET A SPLIT BETWEEN

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:06.837

OF WELL INTENTIONED --

00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:41.338
BUT ULTIMATELY DISASTROUS POLICY

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:42.105
DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:44.908
BY THE SENATE STATE SINCE.

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:47.043

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.146
THE STATE LAW THAT IS CREATED

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:50.414
THIS HURDLE OR FEDERAL LAW.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.015
OR PADELL FEDERAL LAW CREATES A

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:53.550
BENEFIT OKAY OUR STATE HAS

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:54.284
FAILED IN KEEPING THE PROMISE

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:54.584
[inaudible]

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.653
GET.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.422
BY DOING WHAT.

FIFTEEN BE WAIVER.

00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:06.696
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT MEDICAID

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:08.598
AS A HEALTH BENEFIT.

00:51:08.665 --> 00:51:09.933
YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH IS

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:50.106
CALIFORNIA.

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:51.908
WE CREATED THIS CAR OUT.

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:53.143
AND THEN WE FOR MANY YEARS

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.677
FUNDED ALMOST NOTHING FOR

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:54.578
CHILDREN.

00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:56.112
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE LEGAL

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:57.714
ADVOCACY OF CAN DAHLE SHEA AND

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.349
AND HELP AND PATRICK GARDNER

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:00.317
YOUNG MINDS ADVOCACY IN OTHERS.

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:01.151
THERE WAS A LAWSUIT IN THE LATE

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:02.452
NINETIES THAT SAID THE STATE IS

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:03.854
NOT MEETING ITS OBLIGATION.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.188
THUS WAS BORN THE EPS TO T.

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:06.289
BENEFIT.

00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:07.924
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME COUNTIES

00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:09.326
GOT MONEY TO SERVE KIDS

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:09.893
BEGINNING IN THE EARLY TWO

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.061
THOUSANDS.

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:13.063
NOT COINCIDENTALLY TIMED WITH

00:52:13.129 --> 00:52:14.631
THE EXPANSION THAT I SHOWED YOU

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:15.832
UP ON THE ON THE POWER POINT. TO

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.367
BEGIN THE LATE NINETIES EARLY

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.903
TWO THOUSANDS COUNTY AND

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.571
MEDICAID MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:22.906
EPS DUTY.

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:23.974
SOME I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.575
HISTORY UNKNOWNS DETAILED BUT

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:26.543
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.012
BIFURCATION OF THE MIND AND BODY

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:31.081
IN CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAID PROGRAM.

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:33.083
COUNTY IS THE MAIL HEALTH PLAN.

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.351
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE THE FIFTH

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:36.486
OF THIS IS A HEALTH PLAN.

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:38.221
AND HOW IT'S BEEN FINANCED --

00:52:38.288 --> 00:52:39.456
AND COUNTIES HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:41.057
THE RESOURCES AND THEY'VE BEEN

00:52:41.124 --> 00:52:42.259
CREATED AND THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:42.993
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT I

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:44.528
BELIEVES ON REASONABLE.

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:46.930
SO THE WAY FORWARD TO GIVE

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.164
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCESS TO THE

00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:49.032
RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO THE

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:50.567
WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:52.569
IS TO REFORM.

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:53.203
THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IN MENTAL

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.170
HEALTH.

00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:56.439
AND GIVE KIDS THE RESOURCES THAT

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:56.973
THEY ARE ENTITLED TO UNDER

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.276
FEDERAL LAW [inaudible]

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:01.845
SO -- CAN I

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.046
CAN A LOCAL SCHOOL I'M SORRY THE

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:04.180
KIND OF LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:06.550
BELT BILL CAN ALLEY A BILL.

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.785
WHO WHO THEY BILL YEAH SO

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:09.452
THERE'S --

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:10.654
SOME TO SOME GREAT WORK FROM C.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.922
T. A AND THE NURSES THERE'S BEEN

00:53:11.988 --> 00:53:14.357
A NEW BILLING MECHANISM SO I'M.

00:53:14.424 --> 00:53:15.091
AND I'M AGAIN I HOPE THIS IS

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:17.394
USEFUL BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET A

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.962
MEDICAID DOLLAR.

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:19.963
THERE'S BASICALLY THREE WAYS TO

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.131
GET YOUR BILL YOUR MENTAL HEALTH

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:21.665
PLAN.

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:22.566
YOUR BILL YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:23.567
PLAN OR YOUR BILL THE STATE

00:53:23.633 --> 00:53:25.335
DIRECT.

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:27.304
AND THE LA A IS HAVE TWO WAYS TO

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:29.005
GET MONEY FROM THE STATE DIRECT.

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:30.941
FOR MENTAL HEALTH YES FOR FROM

00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:32.509
HEALTH CARE PERIOD BECAME THE

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:33.977
FIRST IS L. E. A ADMINISTRATIVE

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.345
ACTIVITIES WHICH MEANS FOR ALL

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:36.446
THE WORK IT DOES TO HELP KIDS

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:38.848
GET ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM TO

00:53:38.915 --> 00:53:40.183
CONNECT THEM TO CARE.

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.318
BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:42.018
BILL IT'S HARD IT'S

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:44.421
ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME.

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:45.755
BY WAY OF EXAMPLE IN OAKLAND

00:53:45.822 --> 00:53:47.457
OAKLAND GOT A ALMOST EIGHT

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:48.825
HUNDRED GRAND VALLEY A MEDICAID

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:50.493
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES AND WE

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.296
SPENT OVER FORTY MILLION.

00:53:53.363 --> 00:53:54.764
OF THE PSG MOUTH SO NOW WE MáS

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:55.632
SMALL.

00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:57.267
THERE IS NEWLY AGAIN THROUGH THE

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:58.168
ADVOCACY OF ITS CALIFORNIA

00:53:58.234 --> 00:54:00.036
TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND OF THE

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:01.104
PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ASSOCIATION

00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:02.339
THE SCHOOL NURSES.

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:03.907
THERE HAS RECENTLY BEEN MOVEMENT

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:05.542
THAT WILL ALLOW ELEAZAR TO BILL

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:06.710
MEDICAID DIRECTOR SOMETHING

00:54:06.776 --> 00:54:08.645
CALLED THE L. EAT A BILLING

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:11.214
OPTION PROGRAM HOW WE A. B. O.

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:11.381
P..

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.316
AND THAT EXISTS.

00:54:13.383 --> 00:54:16.219
THAT THAT'S A NEW.

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:18.488
I WOULD ARGUE AGAIN THOUGH THAT

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:20.223
IT'S A DIFFICULT AND BURDENSOME

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:21.958
PATHWAY TO BRING RESOURCES TO

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:22.959
THE TWO AT THE SCALE WE'RE

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:24.828
TALKING ABOUT.

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:25.729
REMEMBER THOSE THREE SOURCES I

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:26.963
TOLD YOU GET MEDICAID CAN GET IT

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.865
THROUGH THE ALLEY A OPTION.

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:29.799
YOU CAN GET YOUR MENTAL HEALTH

00:54:29.866 --> 00:54:31.067
PLAN WE GET IT THROUGH YOUR

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.369
MENTAL HEALTH PLAN DOES THE

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.470
BASICALLY THE THREE WAYS YOU GET

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.071
ACCESS TO MEDICAID.

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:36.740
I THINK THIS ELLIE A STUFF IS

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:38.108
TOO SMALL TO MATTER AT THE SCALE

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:40.610
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:41.544
AND THAT IS WE HAVE THE BEST

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:42.746
CELL WHY THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:43.947
OR WHAT YEAH BECAUSE THINK OF

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.482
MEDICARE LIKE A POT OF GOLD IN

00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:46.082
DC YOU GET A DOLLAR IF YOU PUT

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:47.584
UP A DOLLAR.

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:48.251
SO.

00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:50.487
WHEN I LIAISE BILL MEDICAID THEY

00:54:50.553 --> 00:54:51.121
STILL HAVE TO PUT UP THE DOLLAR

00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:52.722
TO GET THE DOLLAR?

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:54.658
SO THAT'S ASKING DISTRICTS TO

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:55.558
INVEST YOUR MONEY AND EVEN

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:57.560
WHAT'S ONLY FIFTY CENTS ON THE

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:58.128
DOLLAR IT'S FIFTY CENTS MORE

00:54:58.194 --> 00:54:58.962
THAN I GOT.

00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:00.096
I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO STOP

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.531
ASKING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:02.165
THERAPISTS AND DOCTORS LET THEM

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:04.034
EDUCATE.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:04.734
BUT THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO ITS

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:06.870
OP IT'S MEET ITS OBLIGATION AND

00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:07.504
BY THE WAY THEY HAVE A LOT MORE

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:08.571
MONEY.

00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:09.839
SO THAT'S WHY YOUR HEARING IN MY

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:12.575
OPINIONATED STATEMENT --

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.544
THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE PATHWAY

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:15.612
FOR TO BRING RESOURCES TO SCHOOL

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:17.914
DISTRICTS THAT SCALE IS NOT TO

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:18.481
FORCE THEM INTO THE ALLEY A

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:19.816
BILLING PLAY --

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:21.351
DISTRICTS WILL DO IT AND SOME

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:22.619
WILL BE SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL AT

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:24.521
IT BUT I THINK IT'S FOOL'S GOLD.

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:25.588
THE REAL WAY TO BRING THESE TYPE

00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:27.490
OF SERVICES TO SCALE ON SCHOOL

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:29.726
CAMPUSES IS TO FILL THE EPS TT

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:30.660
MANDATE.

00:55:30.727 --> 00:55:32.929
THAT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:33.530
SIXTY SEVEN THAT OUR STATE HAS

00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:35.565
FAILED TO DELIVER.

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:38.001
THANK YOU AND WE MAYBE.

00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:39.102
DEBBIE THE CONSULTANT WHO WHO

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.537
HANDLES THIS MATTER MAYBE I'M

00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:41.838
SURE USE YOU'VE HAD INTERACTION

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:43.473
OBVIOUSLY BEFORE BUT I I THINK

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.375
WHAT WE NEED IS IS THE DETAIL

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:46.943
WHICH YOU JUST DELIVERED.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.079
A QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE WE KEEP

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:49.979
SAYING WHERE IS IT WHERE IS IT

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:52.282
WHERE IS IT WE KEEP WAITING AND

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:53.383
CLEARLY THERE'S THERE'S

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:55.118
SOMETHING FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.119
THAT IS NOT CONNECTING YOUR AND

00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:57.320
THAT'S CERTAINLY FOR MENTAL

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:58.221
HEALTH SERVICES.

00:55:58.288 --> 00:56:00.657
BUT EVEN OVERALL HEALTH SERVICES

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:01.758
AT THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL LISTEN

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:03.393
I COME FROM HIGH SCHOOL FIVE

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.461
THOUSAND STUDENTS I'M SURE YOU

00:56:04.527 --> 00:56:05.595
CAN EMPLOY A FULL TIME DOCTOR

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:07.464
PLUS. FOR JUST THAT HIGH SCHOOL

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:08.998
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU

00:56:09.065 --> 00:56:10.500
BUILD IT THERE WHAT IS IT THAT

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:12.235
HOW DO YOU BILL HOW DO YOU GET.

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:16.206
THIS DONE BECAUSE EVER SINCE

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:17.974
THIS BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.709
HAPPENING SO WE MOVED SOMEHOW WE

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:21.811
NEED TO CONNECT THESE TO THESE

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:23.279
TO VENTURE SOME SORRY SIR AT ALL

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:24.481
TO CHAIR I WOULD AND I WOULDN'T

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:25.648
WILL NOT DISAGREE WITH MR RISCO

00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:26.282
I WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION A

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.649
BIT.

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:28.718
DIFFERENTLY I I THINK THAT --

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:30.920
IN SOME SCENARIOS THAT SOLUTION

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:32.655
IS A VIABLE SOLUTION BECAUSE OF

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:33.690
THE NUMBERS BECAUSE OF THE

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.892
CAPACITY BECAUSE OF THE WORK

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:37.193
FORCE RESOURCES AS HE SAID.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.330
ALAMEDA HAD SOME SOME SOME

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:42.866
EXTERNAL IN OF RESOURCES

00:56:42.932 --> 00:56:44.934
RESOURCES OTHER THEY COULD DRAW

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:45.535
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK IN ALL

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:46.136
TERRACE.

00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:47.737
AND AND SO THE QUESTION OF HOW

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:48.338
DO WE DO THAT HOW TO SUPPORT

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:50.640
THAT WHAT WE'RE FINDING A LOT OF

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:51.708
SMALLER RURAL COMMUNITIES AS

00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:52.942
THEY'RE FIGURING IT OUT THERE

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:54.144
THIRD BUILDING THESE

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.545
PARTNERSHIPS THEY'RE CAUGHT IN

00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:56.946
ITS ITS THE PICKING UP THE PHONE

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.047
AND ARE CALLING THE BEHAVIOR

00:56:58.114 --> 00:56:58.381
HEALTH TRACK.

00:56:58.448 --> 00:56:59.816
AND SAYING HEY HOW DO WE MAKE

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:01.184
THIS WORK AND IN ALL TERRACE

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:02.585
THIS THAT MENTAL HEALTH STAFF

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:03.553
ACTUALLY.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.588
SEE SEE CONSUMERS AT THE HIGH

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.090
SCHOOL THEY WERE THEY WALK ON

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:08.792
THE CAMPUS BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL

00:57:08.858 --> 00:57:10.860
TOWN BECAUSE THEY CAN BECAUSE

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:15.632
THEY HAVE SO FEW PEOPLE THIS

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:17.767
RELATIONSHIP FOR THEIR WHERE

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:18.902
WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS.

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.470
HOW CAN THE STATE FACILITATE

00:57:20.537 --> 00:57:21.838
MANY PASSED TO GET THERE CLEARLY

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:22.772
THERE ARE SOME STRUCTURAL ISSUES

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:23.373
THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED IN

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:23.907
TERMS OF FINANCING SOME

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:25.441
COMMUNITIES WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:26.743
ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND PUT THOSE

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:28.077
RESOURCES?

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:29.879
IN PLACE TO EXACTLY AS ALAMEDA

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:30.747
HAS DONE.

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.081
BUT IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:33.616
MIGHT NOT WORK FOR A VARIETY OF

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:34.984
REASONS THE PHYSICAL

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.420
INFRASTRUCTURE IN IN IN SANTA

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:39.155
CLARA FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE MAKING

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:40.423
A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.192
INVESTMENT TO CREATE.

00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:43.660
A WHAT'S WHAT'S CALL THAT IT'S

00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:45.395
AN INTEGRATED USE MENTAL HEALTH

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:45.962
AND PHYSICAL HEALTH PROGRAMS

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:47.230
TARGETING.

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:49.332
YOUTH FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE SO

00:57:49.399 --> 00:57:49.866
TRUMP RECALL TRANSITION

00:57:49.933 --> 00:57:51.568
EIGHTIETH AND THEY'RE DESIGNING

00:57:51.634 --> 00:57:52.902
THIS USING HIM TO SAY INNOVATION

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:54.971
FUNDS TO SERVE EVERY USED IN THE

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:55.672
COUNTY.

00:57:55.738 --> 00:57:57.740
THAT CAN COME IN REGARDLESS OF

00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:00.810
WHETHER OR NOT IT HOW DOES NOT

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:02.345
HAVE MEDI CAL HAS KAISER

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:03.413
INSURANCE.

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:05.381
AND SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE BEGINNING

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:07.217
TO LOOK AT IS HOW CAN THE STATE

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:09.686
FACILITATE MULTIPLE PATHS SO

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:11.120
THAT WE CAN DESIGN STRATEGIES

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:13.089
THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:14.057
FOR THE SCENARIO.

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:15.925
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE ALSO

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.293
TRYING TO BUILD THE

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.028
INFRASTRUCTUREIN TERMS OF USING

00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:20.263
ADMINISTRATIVE DATA TO

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.632
UNDERSTAND WHAT WORK FOR HOME IN

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:24.133
WHAT COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WAY IS.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.102
IT MAY BE THAT IN SOME PLACES

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.804
THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CLINIC

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:29.639
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. FOR

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:31.341
OTHERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:33.977
ARE LEAVING SCHOOL BUT MIGHT

00:58:34.043 --> 00:58:35.745
NEED CONTINUOUS CARE THEY MIGHT

00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:37.013
NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO THEIR

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.048
HIGH SCHOOL AT NINETEEN OR

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:40.483
TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE TO CONTINUE

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:41.351
THAT SERVICE.

00:58:41.417 --> 00:58:43.953
SO I THINK WHILE NOT DISAGREEING

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.723
SUGGESTING THAT. ONE SIZE

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:48.157
DOESN'T NECESSARILY FIT ALL.

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:50.226
BUT WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:52.095
IS HOW DO WE ARRAY FISCAL

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:53.696
INCENTIVES.

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:55.832
PROGRAMMATIC SUPPORT TECHNICAL

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:56.933
ASSISTANCE.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.534
AND OTHER STRAIGHT LEADERSHIP

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.837
STRATEGIES AROUND DATA AROUND

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:02.805
REGULATORY RULES SO THAT WE CAN

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:03.539
ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE

00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:05.475
EXPERIMENTATION AND INVESTMENTS

00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:07.210
IN THE STRATEGIES THAT SCHOOLS

00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:07.977
AND COUNTIES COULD WORK OUT

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:08.878
TOGETHER.

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:10.747
IN WAYS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT

00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:11.881
MISTER BRISCOE'S CALLING FOR

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:13.983
THAT THEN LEAD TO CHANGES IN HOW

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.385
THESE COMMUNITIES CAN ACCESS

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:16.252
DOLLARS.

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.520
SO THAT THE DOLLARS ARE

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:20.223
RESPONSIVE TO THE STRATEGIES NOT

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:22.392
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:24.527
THANK YOU ENOUGH TO THINK THANK

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:26.562
YOU FOR THE DETAILS.

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:28.164
APOLOGIZE TO COMMITTEE FOR

00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:28.765
TAKING OF THAT AMOUNT OF TIME

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:29.832
BUT I FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO

00:59:29.899 --> 00:59:32.135
ASK THOSE QUESTIONS ARE THERE

00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:33.870
OTHERS THAT WAS TO COME A DOCTOR

00:59:33.937 --> 00:59:34.270
WOULD.

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:45.748

HAS PROVIDERS SO WITH YOUR

00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:49.185
DENTIST OR PHYSICIAN IT'S IT'S

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:52.488
IT'S CUMBERSOME IT'S DIFFICULT --

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:54.090
IS IT I GUESS I'M TRYING TO

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:55.591
UNDERSTAND IS A DIFFICULT.

00:59:55.658 --> 00:59:56.492
ARE YOU ARE THERE A LOT OF

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:59.529
DENIALS --

BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU MAY.

01:00:01.564 --> 01:00:02.098
WITH --

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:03.166
FORMER CONGRESSMAN PATRICK

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:04.534
KENNEDY YESTERDAY TALKED ABOUT

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.102
THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:07.437
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH YOUR

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:08.771
TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE PLAN

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.940
WORK.

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:13.276
OFTENTIMES THE DENIAL RATE IS

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:15.244
MUCH HIGHER THAN IT IS IN OTHER

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:17.847
KINDS OF CARE AND SO I'M CURIOUS

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.549
IS THAT IS THAT PART OF THE

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:20.783
ISSUE OR IS IT A TECHNICAL ISSUE

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:24.454
OR BECAUSE A LOT OF YEARS.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.722
YEAH SO I'M FOR AGAIN I BUT BY

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.690
WELCOME THIS QUESTION AND THANK

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:28.257
YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THE

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:32.295
DETAIL -- IN

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:32.829
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN EVEN

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:33.429
EXAMPLE FROM THE PHYSICAL HOW

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:35.164
SPACE CAMP IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:35.732
SIX IF YOU HAD MEDICAID IN

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:36.566
CALIFORNIA.

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:38.534
YOU HAD A CAR THAT SAID MEDICAID

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.770
AND HAD FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICARE.

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:41.971
I WAS LIKE HAVING A TICKET TO

01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:42.538
NOWHERE BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:43.840
TAKE THE RATES RIGHT.

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:45.241
SO CAN BASH A AND OTHERS AT THE

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:45.742
STATE.

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.810
MEET IS BRAVE DECISION THAT SAID

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:49.579
LOOK IF PEOPLE CAN GET ACCESS TO

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:51.214
CARE WE GOT A CHANGE HOW WE PAY.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.348
SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WENT

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.216
THROUGH THIS TRANSFORMATION

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:54.717
CALLED MEDI CAL CONSOLIDATION

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:56.285
WHICH IS A FANCY TERM FOR THE

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:58.187
MOVEMENT TO MANAGE CARE.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:00:59.689
SO WE WENT FROM 90% OF PEOPLE IF

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:00.590
YOU FOR SERVICE TODAY 90% OF

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:02.925
PEOPLE MANAGED CARE.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:03.493
WE CAN BRING BEHAVIOR HEALTH

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.795
WITH US.

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:06.596
IN FACT WE DID EVEN WORSE THAN

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:07.196
THAT.

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.766
IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.401
YOU HAVE TO BILL PER MINUTE.

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:12.402
PER UNIT.

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:16.506
PER PATIENT PER DIAGNOSIS.

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:18.274
SO THINK FOR SECOND IF YOU'RE

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.109
NOT MY WIFE IS A PEDIATRICIAN

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.979
SHE RUNS A NUCLEAR SF GENERAL.

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:23.613
HOW YOU GONNA DIAGNOSIS TWO YEAR

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:25.348
OLD?

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:26.749
WHEN THEIR MOMS ANXIETY

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:27.683
DEPRESSION IS WAS REALLY CAUSING

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.651
THE BEHAVIOR CHALLENGE?

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:31.020
SO WE HAVE CREATED A A

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.488
REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM THAT'S

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:34.123
DRIVEN BY PATHOLOGY WITH THE

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.925
UNIQUE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN.

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:36.592
BEHAVIOR HEALTH IT'S HARDER TO

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:39.028
BUILD THAN ANYTHING A PHYSICAL

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:41.197
HEALTH BAYLOR HAS TO BILL.

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:43.066
YOU KNOW I'VE RUN AFTER IT SEES.

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:45.068
I'VE FILLED HOSPITAL COST

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:48.504
REPORTS I EACH OF BILLING

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.039
MEDICAID MENTAL HEALTH.

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:52.975
IN FACT 55% OF THE TIME THAT

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:56.546
CLINICIANS SPEND 55%.

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:58.247
IS SPENT BILLING.

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.348
SO ALL THE SHOULD THE

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.117
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE SHORTAGES

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:02.485
OF CHILD PSYCHIATRIST.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.519
NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A SHORTAGE

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:04.687
OF THEM BUT WE'RE HAVING TO

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:05.888
SPEND MORE THAN HALF THE TIMES

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.123
ON A PAPERWORK.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.658
IT'S INSANE.

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:11.260
SO IT AGAIN I WOULD INVITE YOU

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:11.828
THAT IF WE WERE GONNA DO ONE

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:12.929
THING.

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:14.797
WE'D REFORM HOW MEDICAID

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:17.033
BEHAVIOR.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.901
IS STRUCTURED AND REIMBURSED.

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:19.802
AND I KNOW THAT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.037
FAR AWAY FROM THE NEEDS OF A

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.405
TEACHER BUT IT'S NOT.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.040
IT'S WHAT'S GONNA STOP US FROM

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:25.475
BRINGING THE SERVICES TO KIDS ON

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:26.776
CAMPUSES EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:28.911
ENTITLED TO THEM AND THEY SHOULD

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:29.479
BE GETTING TO YOU SHOULD BE

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:33.049
GETTING THE THERE'S A QUESTION.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.584
YEAH SADLY S..

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:35.251
AND LIKE I'D LIKE TO ADD ON TO

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:37.386
THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE IS

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:40.223
DOESN'T GET EASIER BETTER ON THE

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:40.656
PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE.

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:41.557
NOW.

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:43.059
SO THAT IF.

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:45.628
IF YOU HAVE A CHILD TODAY IN

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:47.029
SACRAMENTO COUNTY.

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.831
WHO IS EXHIBITING EARLY SIGNS OF

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:50.133
PSYCHOSIS?

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:52.335
UC DAVIS RUNS.

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:54.337
SOME OF THE BEST PROGRAMS IN THE

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.838
COUNTY AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.540
PSYCHOSIS CLINIC FOR PEOPLE WITH

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.342
PRIVATE SECTOR INSURANCE.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:00.510
AND EARLY PSYCHOSIS CLINIC FOR

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:02.111
PEOPLE WITH MEDICARE NOW YOU

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:04.247
WANT YOUR CHILD IN MEDI CAL.

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.915
THE QUALITY OF THE CARE WHAT'S

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:06.382
COVERED.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.584
RIGHT PART OF THE REASON WHY

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:10.353
WE'RE PUTTING ALL THIS PRESSURE.

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:10.953
ON THIS PUBLIC SYSTEM IN SOME

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:14.857
WAYS IS BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO.

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:15.958
WELL WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.927
ADVANCES IN THE QUALITY OF CARE

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:18.928
THAT YOU CAN GET THROUGH THE

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.596
PRIVATE MARKET WE'RE NOT SEEING

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:22.532
THOSE ADVANCES.

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:23.900
ON THE BAY FOR A WHOLE SIDE.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.535
RIGHT WE WE HAVE SO IT'S NOT

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:27.236
JUST ON THE MEDI CAL SITE IS

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:28.304
HARD TO FIND THE PROVIDER

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:29.605
BECAUSE THE BILLING IT'S HARD.

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:31.240
IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:32.675
PEOPLE WITH PRIVATE SECTOR

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:34.343
INSURANCE AS WELL.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.078
AND SO I SO I I WANT TO CONNECT

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.147
THESE TWO BECAUSE MANY OF THE

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:40.016
CHILDREN WERE TALKING ABOUT HALF

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:41.350
PRIVATE INSURANCE.

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.085
WE'RE NOT SEEING THE PUBLIC

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:45.688
SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S A COUNTY OR

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:46.889
A CONTRACTOR WHOSE FOR SERVING

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.591
THOSE CHILDREN ACCESSING THE

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:49.759
FUNDS.

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:51.394
THAT THE FAMILIES PAID INTO IN

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.229
TERMS OF PREMIUMS TO MAKE SURE

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:54.463
THEIR CHILDREN ARE GETTING CARE

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.465
SO THERE'S DISCONNECTS BETWEEN

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:58.768
WHAT PEOPLE NEED CHILDREN NEED.

01:03:58.834 --> 01:04:00.169
AND THE PUBLIC DOLLAR AND

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:01.037
THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:04.473
WHAT PEOPLE NEED AND THE PRIVATE

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.875
SECTOR DOLLARS WHILE.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:07.143
WHAT I HEARD YESTERDAY FROM A

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.811
FORMER CONGRESSMAN WAS THAT --

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.079
THE DENIAL RATE FOR BEHAVIORAL

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:12.715
HEALTH SERVICES IS HIGHER THAN

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.884
ANY OTHER SERVICE PROVIDED --

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:16.018
IN MEDICINE.

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:18.020
THAT THAT WAS.

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:19.288
WHAT HE PERCEIVED AS A NATION

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:20.856
WIDE SO I DON'T I DON'T KNOW

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.625
WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA --

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.461
BUT IF IT'S ANYWHERE CLOSE TO

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.064
THAT IT'S IT'S PRETTY DISTURBING.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.965
AND IF IF I COULD MAKE ONE MORE

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.900
COMMENT AT IF 60% OF THE KIDS

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.201
ARE MEDICAID AND FEDERAL

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:33.769
ENTITLED THIS BENEFIT.

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:34.737
IN A ONE SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:36.572
FOLLOW MY RECOMMENDATION WHICH

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:38.474
IS TO ACTIVATE THE H. YES AND

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:39.675
REQUIRE THE STATE GIVE YOU A

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.510
PLAN. TO MEET THE THE THE

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:43.546
DETAILS THE MANDATE.

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:44.180
ON THE PRIVATE SIDE YOU DO HAVE

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:45.982
A LEVER.

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:49.252
THE FEDERAL PARITY ACT OF TWO

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:49.885
THOUSAND EIGHT ESSENTIAL BENEFIT

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:50.519
PACKAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:51.587
ACT REQUIRE THAT PRIVATE

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:52.955
INSURERS.

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:55.057
OFFER THE SAME ACCESS TO

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:55.691
BEHAVIOR HEALTH AS THEY USED AS

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:57.426
WEALTH.

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:57.960
WE AS A STATE ARE LATE TO

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.295
ENFORCEMENT.

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.997
SO TO ADOPT JUST TO SAY WE DON'T

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.431
HAVE TO JUST LEAVE THAT IT'S NOT

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:03.466
JUST ABOUT MEDICAID THOUGH

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:04.667
MEDICAID'S GO IMPORTANT.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.702
AND IT'S 60% OF GETS THE THERE

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:07.903
IS A STRATEGY FOR THE

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:09.505
COMMERCIALLY INSURED FOLKS.

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:12.341
TO THAT I THINK THE ELECTED TO

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:14.710
PURSUE.

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.078
AND THEN ONE FINAL QUESTION TO

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:16.612
THIS YEAR --

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:17.713
DOCTOR EWING YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.816
THE ALTIRIS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.652
UNIQUE APPROACH IT SOUNDS IT CAN

01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:23.352
YOU WALK ME THROUGH THAT A

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:24.887
LITTLE BIT WAS T IS IT WAS IT

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.222
MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.456
THROUGH THE COUNTY OR THEIR

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:28.658
THROUGH THE CITY.

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:29.892
THEY'RE NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:30.493
SCHOOLS THAT ARE FIGURE OUT A

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:33.996
WAY TO BILL TO NINE I'M INTO A

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.765
LOT OF SMALL TOWNS IN MY

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:36.332
DISTRICT YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:37.166
RIGHT.

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:38.401
I WENT UP THERE INSTANCE OF TIME

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:40.503
WITH THEIR COUNTY STAFF AND THAT

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.605
THEY JUST HAVE RELATIONSHIPS

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:44.106
WITH INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS IN THE

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:45.441
SCHOOLS AND SO YEAH THESE ARE

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:46.542
COUNTY STAFF.

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.277
THEY THEY SHOULD STRUGGLE FOR TO

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:49.679
FIND PRIVATE PROVIDERS IN THESE

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:51.447
COMMUNITIES AND SO I MEAN IT IT

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:53.616
REALLY IS YOU KNOW A SMALL MY

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:54.550
FAMILY'S FROM WE'D.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:57.286
RIDE IS A SMALL TOWN AND AND SO

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:58.421
IT REALLY IS THIS REALLY.

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.423
WHAT WE SEE IS QUITE OFTEN

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:03.092
RELATIONSHIP BASED STRATEGIES

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:05.194
WHETHER IT'S IN FRESNO OR

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:06.929
MONTEREY OR OUT TERRACE?

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.898
IN SOME OF THE STRATEGIES ARE

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:10.800
VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH THE IDEA

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:12.535
OF PUTTING A HEALTH CLINIC IN A

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:13.269
SCHOOL.

01:06:13.336 --> 01:06:14.337
BUT IN SOME OF OUR SMALLER

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:15.404
COMMUNITIES THAT'S NOT

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:17.173
FINANCIALLY VIABLE OR THEY DON'T

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:18.374
HAVE THE WORK FORCE.

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:19.775
SO MIGHT MY COMMENT ABOUT ALL

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:22.445
TERRACE IS THEY FOUND A PATH BUT

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:24.213
QUITE OFTEN THAT GETS

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.648
EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT THERE'S

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.116
LOTS OF WORK AROUNDS.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:28.384
BECAUSE THEY'RE BUMPING UP

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:29.352
AGAINST THE REPORTING

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.220
REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULES OF THE

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:32.922
INFORMATION SHARING OR HOW THIS

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:35.391
INFORMATION FLOWS AND AND AND

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:37.193
AND MY MY OVERARCHING COMMENT IS

01:06:37.259 --> 01:06:39.462
THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:41.630
MULTIPLE STRATEGIES. TO MAKE IT

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:43.666
EASIER FOR COUNTIES AND SCHOOLS

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.201
TO BE SUCCESSFUL AS PARTNERS.

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:47.403
WE HAVE MODELS OUT THERE IN OUT

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:49.438
TERRACE IN ALAMEDA BUT WHAT WE

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:51.540
HAVEN'T DONE IS LEARN FROM THEM

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:52.842
PUT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:54.810
PLACE PUT THE SUPPORT IN PLACE

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:56.512
TO TAKE THOSE MODEL PROGRAMS.

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.080
AND ACTUALLY TAKE THEM TO SCALE

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.148
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.783
STATE IS ACTUALLY BEEN TRYING TO

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:01.484
DO.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:05.921
IN WAYS THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:11.260
THESE COUNTIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:13.295
THANK YOU. FOR THE COMMENTS.

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:15.197
MISTER RATHER.

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:16.799
I JUST A QUICK QUESTION --

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.000
FOR MISTER --

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:19.635
BRISCOE AND THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.403
THOUGHTS THIS IS WILD THAT

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:21.303
DOCTOR EWING YOU MENTIONED I

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.004
THINK THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE TO

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.406
THE FOUR MENTAL HEALTH

AT A SCHOOL SITE WHAT STRUCTURES

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:18.380

SO I THINK IT TAKES A COMMUNITY

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:15.804

I'M BIASED I THINK IT'S A REALLY

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.309
EXCELLENT EXAMPLE.

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:43.211
OF WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED WHEN

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:44.446
THEIR PARTNERSHIPS --

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:46.081

JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.590
BACKGROUND SCHOOL BASED HEALTH

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:57.759
CENTERS ARE HEALTH CARE CLINICS

01:19:57.826 --> 01:20:00.462
ON K. THROUGH TWELVE CAMPUSES.

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:01.963
THEY CAN LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:03.064
YOUR COMMUTE YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.132
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER OR

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:05.467
DOCTOR'S OFFICE WITH THE

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:07.002
EXCEPTION THAT THEY ARE USE

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:07.869
FOCUS.

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:09.471
STATE OFTEN ENGAGE YOUTH AND

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:11.173
THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND THE

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:13.175
SERVICES THEY PROVIDE --

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.709
WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO HUNDRED

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:15.544
AND SIXTY EIGHT SCHOOL BASED

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.411
HEALTH CENTERS THROUGHOUT

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:17.546
CALIFORNIA.

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:18.914
AND THEY PRIMARILY SERVE

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.850
STUDENTS IN LOW INCOME AND UNDER

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:24.219
RESOURCE TO COMMUNITIES --

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:25.520
ABOUT 70% OF OUR SCHOOL BASED

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:26.588
HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDE

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.356
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES

01:20:29.824 --> 01:20:30.458
CARE.

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:31.893
AND I WOULD SAY THAT THAT DATA

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.628
POINT IS ACTUALLY PROBABLY LOWER

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:34.729
THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:36.798
FIELD I THINK IT CONTINUES TO

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:38.433
GROW TO MEET THE NEED THAT ARE

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.601

ACTUALLY DID A LITTLE LOOK AT

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:45.073
OUR DATA AND THE PERCENTAGE USED

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.474
TO BE 60% OF OUR SCHOOL BASED

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:47.976
HEALTH CENTERS JUST FIVE YEARS

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.511
AGO WERE PROVIDING BEHAVIOR ALSO

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:50.145
WE'VE SEEN.

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:53.081
PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:54.249
THE PAST COUPLE YEARS.

01:20:54.316 --> 01:20:55.684
I WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:56.918
MODEL OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.186
CENTERS AND HOW THEY DELIVER

01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:00.055
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND I THINK

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.756
THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THEM IS

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:03.391
TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE THREE

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:05.160
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT. THREE

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.294
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.396
THAT SPONSOR OR RUN SCHOOL BASED

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:09.965
HEALTH CENTERS --

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:11.032
ABOUT HALF OF OUR SCHOOL BASED

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.534
HEALTH CENTERS ARE RUN BY

01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:14.502
COMMUNITY HEALTH SIR HEALTH

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:15.704
CENTERS THESE ARE.

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.339
TYPICALLY FEDERALLY QUALIFIED

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:19.407
HEALTH CENTERS --

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:22.010
THAT USUALLY CO LOCATE SOME

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:23.511
LATER A NURSE PRACTITIONER OR

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:24.846
PRETTY PEDIATRICIAN.

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:27.082
WITH MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:29.084
LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:30.585
MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:32.921
THESE CLINICS RARELY HAVE

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:35.023
CONTRACTS WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:36.424
HEALTH TO DELIVER SPECIALLY

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:38.093
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:39.561
BUT MOST OF THESE CLINICS ARE

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.963
CONTRACTED WITH MANIC MEDI CAL

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:43.498
MANAGED CARE HEALTH PLANS SO

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.000
THEY BILL THROUGH THOSE

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:47.535
CONTRACTS WITH OUR MANAGED CARE.

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:50.839
CARE PLANS IN CALIFORNIA --

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:52.374
ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR SCHOOL

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.575
BASED HEALTH CENTERS --

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:54.843
OFTEN AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.111
AS WELLNESS CENTERS.

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:58.480
ARE RUN BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE

01:21:58.546 --> 01:22:00.148
ACTUALLY UNIQUE OUR STATE IS

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.283
UNIQUE IN THAT WE HAVE A HIGH

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:02.684
PORTION OF OUR SCHOOL BASED

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.119
HEALTH CENTERS THAT ARE RUN BY

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:05.987
SCHOOL DISTRICTS --

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:07.722
SO THESE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:10.392
THAT YOU TYPICALLY USE THEIR

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:13.261
DISTRICT GENERAL FINDS TO HIGHER

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:14.562
SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS MARRIAGE

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:17.165
AND FAMILY THERAPIST TO RUN.

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:18.533
THESE CENTERS AS SPACES ON THEIR

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.568
CAMPUS PRIMARILY TO ADDRESS THE

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:21.136
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:22.070
STUDENTS.

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:24.039
BUT OFTEN THEY LINK TO PRIMARY

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:26.141
CARE AND OTHER CARE IN THE

01:22:26.207 --> 01:22:27.575
COMMUNITY.

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:28.677
AND THEN I WOULD SAY THE THIRD

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:30.478
MODEL THAT WE HAVE --

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:31.913
ABOUT A HANDFUL OF OUR REMAINING

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:32.981
SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:35.050
RUN BY COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:37.185
AGENCIES AND THEY HAVE CONTRACTS

01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:38.987
WITH THEIR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.522
HEALTH DEPARTMENT. TO PROVIDE

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:42.490
SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:44.459
THE DEEP DIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:45.527
OF WHO RUNS OUR SCHOOL BASED

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:47.262
HEALTH CENTERS. TO GIVE YOU AN

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:49.364
EXAMPLE OF WHAT TYPE OF CARE IS

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.066
PROVIDED IN OUR SCHOOL BASED

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.467
HEALTH CENTERS I WANTED TO TALK.

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.602
VERY SIMILAR TO THE PYRAMID THAT --

01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:55.170
MISTER LOMBARDO WAS TALKING

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:58.039
ABOUT GOING FROM WIDE SERVICES

01:22:58.106 --> 01:23:00.075
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MORE

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:02.077
INTENSIVE SERVICES --

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.578
IN A SCHOOL SETTING SO GOING UP

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:04.879
THAT PYRAMID ARE SCHOOL BASED

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.314
HEALTH CENTERS ARE DOING TEACHER

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:07.982
TRAINING AND TEACHER SUPPORT.

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:10.151
THEY ARE OFTEN TEACHING ABOUT

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:12.587
HOW HOW AND THERE ARE SUPPORTING

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:13.755
TEACHERS AND IMPLEMENTING

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.890
RESILIENCE FOCUSED.

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.525
RESTORATIVE PRACTICES IN THE

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:19.260
CLASSROOM HOW TO DO MINDFULNESS

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:21.162
PRACTICES IN THE CLASSROOM TO DE

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.897
ESCALATE STUDENTS THAT HAVE

01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:23.698
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AS THEY

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.266
SEARCHED FOR SERVICE IN THE

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.534
CLASSROOM.

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:27.535
A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:28.870
CENTERS ARE CONDUCTING SCHOOL

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.939
WIDE OR GRADE LEVEL SCREEN SO

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:32.607
THEY MAY SCREEN AN ENTIRE

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.442
STUDENT POPULATION FOR ADVERSE

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:37.212
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR TRAUMA

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:39.681
OR SUBSTANCE USE --

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:40.982
MANY OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:43.351
CENTERS WORK WITH GROUPS OF

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:44.919
YOUTH LEADERS AS PURE HEALTH

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:47.122
EDUCATORS AS YOUTH ADVISORY

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:49.858
BOARDS AND THIS IS OFTEN HOW.

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:50.859
MANY ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:52.160
CENTERS ARE IMPLEMENTING USE

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:53.762
MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID WHERE

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:55.497
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THERE MENTAL

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:58.133
HEALTH RESOURCE FOR THEIR PEERS

01:23:58.199 --> 01:23:59.834
IN THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY.

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:00.502
A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:02.103
CENTERS ARE DOING GROUP THERAPY

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:04.406
SO THEY DO YOUNG MEN'S

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:06.775
EMPOWERMENT CIRCLES GRIEF GROUPS

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:08.476
RESTORATIVE CIRCLES --

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:10.445
A VARIETY OF TOPICS TO BRING

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:12.080
TOGETHER YOUNG PEOPLE TO SUPPORT

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:14.682
THEMSELVES AND ADDRESS

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:15.950
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS.

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:16.818
AND THEN I WOULD SAY MANY OF OUR

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:17.919
SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS.

01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:19.521
ARE PROVIDING ONE ON ONE

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:21.389
INDIVIDUAL CLINICAL THERAPY

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:22.824
TYPICALLY IT'S A BRIEF

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.559
INTERVENTION SO IT'S AT A

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.161
LIMITED NUMBER OF SESSIONS.

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.929
AND IF A STUDENT NEEDS ON GOING

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:29.664
SUPPORT THEY REFER OUT TO A

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:32.066
COMMUNITY PROVIDER THAT CAN BE

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:34.235
CO LOCATED IN THE CLINIC OR

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.204
LOCATED ON THAT SCHOOL CAMPUS SO

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:37.939
THAT'S A MODEL THAT WERE SEEN

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:38.139
GROW.

01:24:38.206 --> 01:24:41.309
THROUGHOUT THE STATE --

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:43.244
AS ASKED TO FINISH UP I WAS

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:44.245
ASKED TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:45.980
BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES ARE

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.715
SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS.

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:50.285
ARE SO. FIFTEEN I THINK ONE OF

01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:51.820
THE INCREDIBLE BENEFITS OF THIS

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:54.355
MODEL IS THAT IN LARGE PART A

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:55.557
LOT OF THE SERVICES ARE BILLABLE

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:57.058
AND THEY'RE EITHER CONTRACTING

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.426
WITH THE COUNTY.

01:24:58.493 --> 01:24:59.527
THEIR CONTRACTING THE MEDI CAL

01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:01.229
HEALTH PLANS --

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:02.831
AND THEY ARE BILLION FOR A LARGE

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:04.265
NUMBER OF THE CLINICAL CARE

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.467
THEY'RE PROVIDING.

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:07.001
I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS THAT

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:08.403
NOT ALL OF THE CARE THAT THEY'RE

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.572
PROVIDING IS BILLABLE SO A LOT

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:14.342
OF THE INCREDIBLY TRANSFORMATIVE --

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:15.176
INTENSIVE --

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:19.113
SCHOOL AIR PROVIDING IN THERE IN

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.381
THE SCHOOLS THAT THEY SERVE IS

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:22.350
NOT A BILLABLE SERVICE SO THAT'S

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.184
A CHALLENGE.

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:24.519
IS HOW TO SUSTAIN THOSE

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:27.188
PRACTICES.

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:28.656
PIGGY BACKING OFF OF THAT

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:29.958
CHALLENGE IS THERE'S NO STATE

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:31.960
FUNDING OR STATE PROGRAM OFFICE

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:33.394
FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:34.662
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:35.730
IF YOU SEE ME TESTIFY YOU'VE

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.499
PROBABLY HEARD ME TALK ABOUT NOT

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:39.000
QUITE A BIT --

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:40.902
CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:43.238
STATE I'M WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:44.739
SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS AND

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.908
NO STATE PROGRAM OFFICE.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:48.443
AND I WOULD JUST --

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:49.944
CAN PIGGYBACK OFF OF MISTER

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:51.813
BRISCOE COMMENTS ALAMEDA COUNTY

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.414
HAS A REALLY ROBUST NETWORK OF

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:54.883
SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS IN

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:56.684
LARGE PART BECAUSE THE COUNTY

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:58.653
HAS PUT UP BASE FUNDING FOR

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.121
THOSE CLINICS --

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:01.890
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT

01:26:01.956 --> 01:26:03.525
NETWORK STRENGTHENED THROUGHOUT

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.560
THE STATE --

01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:06.294
OUR SCHOOL WHICH HEALTH IN A

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:06.861
STRUGGLE WITH COOL SCHOOL

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:09.097
FACILITIES AND CONFIDENTIAL

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:10.532
SPACES HOW DO YOU IT'S IT'S AN

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:12.066
INVESTMENT IT'S A SPACE ON A

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:13.001
CAMPUS.

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:16.304
THAT IS YOUTH FRIENDLY AND YOU

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:17.639
THINK GAUGED.

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:18.673
AND THEN I WOULD SAY THE LAST

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.541
BARRIER THAT.

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:20.542
ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:21.876
AND SCHOOLS BY AND LARGE ARE

01:26:21.943 --> 01:26:23.945
FACING IS THAT THEY OFTEN BECOME

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.114
THE DE FACTO RESOURCE FOR MENTAL

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.783
HEALTH WHEN UNDER INSURED OR NON

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:29.918
MEDI CAL STUDENTS.

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:31.553
CAN'T GET THE HEALTH THAT THEY

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:33.121
ARE ENTITLED TO IN THEIR

01:26:33.187 --> 01:26:34.489
COMMUNITY OR FROM THEIR PRIVATE

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:35.890
HEALTH PLANS --

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:37.225
SO OFTEN ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:38.960
CENTERS ARE THE ONES AND THE

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.295
SCHOOLS ARE THE ONES THAT THAT

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:42.030
PICK UP THE PIECES WHEN THEY

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:44.265
CAN'T NETWORK CARE THEY CAN'T

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:46.668
ACCESS CARE IN THE COMMUNITY --

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:47.835
I'M GONNA FINISH WRAP IT UP KEEP

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:48.803
IT SHORT.

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:49.904
I I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:51.806
DESPITE THOSE BARRIERS THAT ARE

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:52.941
MENTIONED I THINK WE'RE WE'RE

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:54.342
SEEING THE NETWORK OF SCHOOL

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:56.144
BASED HEALTH CENTERS GROW.

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:59.414
AND BE BECOME MORE ROBUST MORE

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.448
AND MORE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:02.750
CENTERS ADD ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH%

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:05.053
ADD ON A FAIRLY ROBUST SPECTRUM

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:06.821
OF CARE IN THEIR CLINICS AND I

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:07.889
THINK THAT'S A TRUE.

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:09.524
TESTAMENT TO THE INCREDIBLE WORK

01:28:00.742 --> 01:28:02.610
TAKEOVER SO --

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:04.846
OUR DISTRICTS MAKING THESE

01:28:04.912 --> 01:28:06.114
DECISIONS TO INVEST IN THESE

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.448
SERVICES WHEN.

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:10.018
THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER.

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:11.819
IN IN THEIR EYES AND THEIR CBO

01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:14.155
SIZE IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND AND ARE

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:15.289
WE SEEING THE ARE WE SEEING THE

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:17.659
OPPOSITE I WAS SEEING A DECREASE

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:20.028
FROM DISTRICTS.

01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:21.663
OFFER THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:23.464
THEY NEEDED USE THEIR EIGHTY

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:24.465
SAID EARLIER USING THEIR KIND OF

01:28:24.532 --> 01:28:26.467
GENERAL FUND.

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:28.002
DISCRETIONARY DOLLARS ARE.

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:29.570
ARE THOSE BEING MORE AND MORE

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:30.905
USED TO JUST KEEP THE DISTRICT.

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:33.341
OF LOS.

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:34.308
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I MEAN I

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:34.942
I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:36.044
MORE AND MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:38.246
INTERESTED IN BUILDING OUT

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:39.947
WELLNESS CENTERS WHICH IF THINK

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:41.649
WE SWEETIE STRUGGLE AS A STATE

01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:43.184
ASSOCIATION TO DEFINE WHETHER

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:43.951
THOSE ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:45.053
CENTERS ARE NOT I THINK.

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:46.587
THAT WE WOULD INCLUDE THEM IN

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:48.022
OUR BIG UMBRELLA --

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:49.457
BUT I THINK IT'S OFTEN A LOWER

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:51.959
BAR TO BRING IN AND DEVELOP A

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:53.695
WELLNESS CENTER OUTSIDE OF A

01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:54.762
SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER.

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:57.131
I THINK --

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:59.300
SO WE'RE SEEN THE NEEDS GROW AND

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:00.435
WERE SEEN AND CONTINUED

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:02.437
INVESTMENT IN IN THIS MODEL IN

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:03.304
THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:04.839
MODEL HOW THEY'RE DOING THAT

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:07.241
LOOKS DIFFERENT IN EVERY

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:07.508
COMMUNITY.

01:29:07.575 --> 01:29:08.242
OFTEN.

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:10.478
I I THINK IT.

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.113
BOILS DOWN TO PARTNERSHIPS

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.848
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS OFTEN

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:14.716
HAVE --

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:16.117
ACCESS GRANTS WHERE THEY CAN

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.185
APPLY -- FOR

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:19.520
ACCESS GRANTS TO BUILD SPACES TO

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:21.656
PROVIDE MORE CARE SO IF A SCHOOL

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:23.124
DISTRICT CAN BRING IN A PARTNER

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:23.991
THAT CAN.

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.560
THAT LEVERAGE THOSE RESOURCES

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:26.761
THEY HAVE THAN THAT SCHOOL

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:27.962
DISTRICT DOESN'T HAVE TO DIP

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:30.264
INTO THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:31.499
FUNDING --

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:33.067
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE BILLION LEN

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:34.702
MEDI CAL AND REINVESTING THOSE

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:36.704
DOLLARS IN SCHOOL HEALTH SUPPORT

01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:37.905
I THINK WE'RE SEEING MORE AND

01:29:37.972 --> 01:29:39.373
MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS UNDERSTAND

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.475
THAT.

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:41.576
TO DRAW DOWN MORE FUNDING FROM

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:46.247
THE STATE THEIR ATTENDANTS TO

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:47.415
DRAW DOWN THOSE DOLLARS THEY

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:48.015
HAVE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:49.717
UNDERLYING BARRIERS THAT KEEP

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:53.121
STUDENTS OUT OF SCHOOL --

01:29:53.187 --> 01:29:54.489
BUT YES.

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:55.590
YELL DISTRICTS ARE CHALLENGED

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:57.058
WITH CHALLENGING DECISIONS AND

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.192
YOU SEE SOMETIMES SCHOOL

01:29:58.259 --> 01:30:00.595
DISTRICTS HAVE A BUDGET FOR THE

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:02.697
SERVICES AND FOR EXAMPLE.

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:04.198
LIKE POLICE SERVICES PUBLIC

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.933
SAFETY WHETHER SCHOOL RESOURCE

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:11.439
SITTING OUT FRONT OR SHOULD YOU

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:12.807
USE THOSE RESOURCES TO HIRE --

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.142
TO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:16.043
IN THE CLASSROOM AND AND I WOULD

01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:17.779
ARGUE THAT THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:19.213
MENTAL HEALTH DEBATE AS THIS

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.681
FRONT CENTER TODAY LOS ANGELES

01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:23.050
DEVOTED TO NOT DO IT COUNTY JAIL

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:24.452

THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE I

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:30.224
THINK YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE WE

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:32.160
DON'T NEED AT A THIRD SCHOOL

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:33.594
RESOURCE OFFICER.

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.496
CAN USE THAT MONEY FOR MENTAL

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:37.098
HEALTH SERVICES OR SCHOOL

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:38.666
COUNSELORS.

01:30:38.733 --> 01:30:40.201
I THINK WE ARE WE WE DO A LOT OF

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.202

PRETTY INTENSIVE WORK IN WERE

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:48.242

DISTRICT AHLERS IN THEIR SCHOOL

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:55.483
BASED HEALTH CENTER SCHOOL

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:56.551
HEALTH NETWORK SO.

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.085
THEY ARE NEARLY DIRECTING IT

01:30:58.152 --> 01:30:59.821
FROM THERE.

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:00.688
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SAY THIS

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:01.689
EVERY YEAR REDIRECTING IT BUT

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:02.890
THERE IS THAT CONVERSATION THAT

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.091
THEY ARE HAPPY IN IN THEIR

THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:12.967
THINK IT REQUIRES --

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.836
INTEGRATED CONVERSATION AT THE

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:16.938

HEADED THAT DIRECTION IN HIS

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.408
CONVERSATION IT REQUIRES THAT

01:31:20.474 --> 01:31:21.976
BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE NATURE OF

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:24.111
OUR OUR STATE IN EACH COUNTY IN

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:25.112

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:34.922
MODEL THAT WORKS WITH. FOR THAT

01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:37.325

01:31:37.391 --> 01:31:39.560
THEIR BRAIDS AS DOLLARS TOGETHER

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:44.732
THE COMPLEXITY OF MENTAL HEALTH --

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.467
FUND AND MEDICAID MEDICARE I'LL

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:48.102
FIND IN.

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:50.104
IS SO UNIQUE IN EACH COUNTY AND

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:51.672
APPROACHED IN DIFFERENT WAYS BY

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:53.074
EACH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.242
I THINK YOU'LL HEAR THAT FROM

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:55.109
DOCTOR MILLER.

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.043
THAT.

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.879
IT REALLY DOES REQUIRE THAT

01:31:57.945 --> 01:31:59.447
INTEGRATED --

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:02.817
SYSTEM TO PROBLEM SOLVE AND LOOK

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.485

HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU BECAUSE ONE

01:34:08.843 --> 01:34:10.378
OF THE THINGS I THINK SYSTEM

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:12.213
RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME PREVENTION

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:12.880
WORK.

01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:15.049
THE MILD MODERATE BUT THE HEALTH

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:16.917
PLANS ARE STILL IN CHARGE OF THE

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:18.619
MILES WHICH I KIND OF

01:34:18.686 --> 01:34:20.721
HIGHLIGHTED SPECTRUM IS GREEN --

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:21.722
THOSE OF YOU FAMILIAR WORKING

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:23.424
WITH HUMANS MIGHT KNOW THAT IT'S

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:24.692
VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHO IS

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:26.127
MILD WHOSE MODERATE AND IN OUR

01:34:26.193 --> 01:34:27.561
BUSINESS MODEL WE'RE SERVING

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:28.662
QUITE A BIT.

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:30.164
OF THE MILD POPULATION ARE

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:32.433
SCHOOL BASED INTEGRATION EFFORTS.

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.101
SO IN MY COUNTY WHAT WE'VE DONE

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.036
IS WE'VE PARTNERED WITH LOCAL

01:34:35.102 --> 01:34:36.670
SCHOOL DISTRICTS --

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:37.972
TO TAKE THEIR EL CAP MONEY SO

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:39.173
THEIR LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.741
CONTROL MONEY AND THEY INVEST

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:42.410
THAT -- IN

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:43.778
GIVING THE MONEY TO US THROUGH

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.513
AND USE AND THEN WE PULL DOWN

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:46.914
FEDERAL FUNDING IS A MATCH.

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:48.716
FOOT SO FOR VERY HIGH POVERTY

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.718
SCHOOLS WE DO IT INITIALLY BASED

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:51.619
ON THE FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH

01:34:51.685 --> 01:34:53.054
NUMBERS THEY PAY --

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.022
A SMALL FRACTION YOU MIGHT KNOW

01:34:55.089 --> 01:34:56.357
THE WAY THAT MEDI CAL WORKS AS

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:57.925
EACH KID HAS AN EIGHT COAT.

01:34:57.992 --> 01:34:59.260
AND THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE CAN

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:00.828
BE AS HIGH AS NINETY SEVEN CENTS

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:02.329
ON THE DOLLAR.

01:35:02.396 --> 01:35:03.164
PEOPLE DOWN A LOT OF FEDERAL

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:05.199
MONEY AND THEN WE JUST CHARGE

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:06.834
THE SCHOOL FOR THE REMAINDER

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:08.836
THAT'S ON COVERED USING THEIR AL

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:09.603
CAPP MONEY.

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:11.872
AND NOT SYSTEM HAS BEEN REALLY

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:15.142
SUCCESSFUL RULES --

01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:16.043
PEOPLE THIS COMMITTEE MIGHT

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:17.445
REMEMBER THAT COUNTY BEAVER

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:18.212
HEALTH USED TO BE IN CHARGE OF

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:20.815
DOING THE I EP RELATED SERVICES --

01:35:20.881 --> 01:35:22.049
THERE'S A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.684
OVER FIVE YEARS AGO WHERE MOST

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.252
COUNTIES BROKE UP IN OUR COUNTY

01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:27.021
WE NEVER GOT DIVORCED STAY

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:28.089
TOGETHER.

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:28.722
KIND OF SAY WE WENT TO MARRIAGE

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:31.425
COUNSELLING DID A LOT AND USE.

01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:32.493
AND THROUGH THAT THAT'S WHERE WE

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.762
DEVELOP THAT IDEA AROUND TAKING

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:36.464
THAT LOCAL EL CAP DOLLARS AND

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:37.898
GET INTO KIDS BEFORE THEY HAVE

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:38.666
AN IGP.

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:40.034
IGP IS NOT THE BEST TIME TO

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:41.168
INTERVENE WITH THE KIDS THEY

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.703
ALREADY HAVE A PROBLEM.

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:43.904
SO WE REALLY WORKED TO DEVELOP

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:45.272
KIND OF THE INTERCONNECTED

01:35:45.339 --> 01:35:47.308
SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK WE USE SOME

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:48.776
INNOVATION DOLLARS SO KIND OF

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:50.544
FROM TOBY SHOP --

01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:51.846
AN HSA INNOVATION DOLLARS

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:53.647
INITIALLY FUNDED --

01:35:53.714 --> 01:35:55.349
FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO P. I. S.

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:56.717
WHICH REALLY TAUGHT US HOW TO BE

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:57.985
IN THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:35:58.052 --> 01:35:59.320
CULTURE AND INTERVENE AS EARLY

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:00.688
AS POSSIBLE --

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:02.389
AND REALLY DEVELOP STRATEGIES

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:03.257
FOR THE COMMISSION SO WE HAVEN'T

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:04.658
SCHOOLS THAT ARE MORE PRIMARY

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:06.160
PREVENTION SO DOING SOME GROUP

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:07.094
WORK.

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:08.195
SOME WORK ON SCHOOL CULTURE AND

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.430
SCHOOL CLIMATE AND THEN BEING

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:11.031
ABLE TO RESPONSE TO THE VERY

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:12.800
HIGH NEEDS KIDS WHICH ON YOUR

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.301
DIAGRAM HERE I KIND OF SHOWS ARE

01:36:14.368 --> 01:36:15.503
A TIER.

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:16.303
THREE SO OUR GOAL IN THE

01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:18.539
PARTNERSHIP WITH SCHOOLS IS TO

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:22.076
PROVIDE AS COST EFFECTIVE

01:36:22.143 --> 01:36:23.177
SERVICES AS POSSIBLE.

01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:23.777
THE VALUE PROPOSITION I THINK

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:24.879
THAT WE BRING TO THE SCHOOL

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:25.880
SYSTEM IS AGAIN LEADING TEACHERS

01:36:25.946 --> 01:36:27.081
BE TEACHERS I THINK THEY DESERVE

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:29.150
THAT THAT'S A HARD ENOUGH JOB --

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:30.985
AND THEN WE WE COMMENDED

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:32.219
BEHAVIOR ALL SPECIALISTS.

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:35.256
AND OUR CLINICIANS ARE TRAINED

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:36.824
OF TRAINING A BIG INVESTMENT

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:38.025
REALLY TO RESPOND TO WHAT MIGHT

01:36:38.092 --> 01:36:40.194
BE A MILD DEPRESSION ALL THE WAY

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:41.262
UP TO A KID THAT BECAUSE OF AN

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:42.897
I. P. HAS TO BE PLACED OUTSIDE

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:44.298
OF THAT COUNTY --

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:45.599
INTO A RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT

01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:46.901
FACILITY --

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:48.435
AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:49.503
THINK THAT ISOLATED SCHOOL

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:51.205
COUNSELORS CAN DO SO SOME OTHER

01:36:51.272 --> 01:36:53.274
BUSINESS MODELS THAT EXIST --

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.475
THAT PEOPLE ARE IMPLEMENTING ITS

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:56.610
MORE SCHOOLS HIRING THERAPISTS.

01:36:56.677 --> 01:36:58.579
BUT WE REALLY SEE THE VALUE IN

01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:01.582
HAVING AN INTEGRATED SCHOOL TEAM.

01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:02.917
SO WE CAN INVEST IN KIND OF BALK

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:04.285
TRAINING AND REALLY LOOKING

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:06.053
CLOSELY AT THE QUALITY QUALITY

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.055
CONTROL THE SERVICES PROVIDED --

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:09.290
AND THEN ALL THAT ARDUOUS MEDI

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:12.026
CAL BILLING THAT WE LOVE TO HATE.

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.661
MY TEAM DOES THAT AND THE

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:14.862
SCHOOLS JUST REALLY --

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:16.597
PAYING THE DIFFERENCE SO I THINK

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:17.765
IT BRINGS A LOT MORE MONEY INTO

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.967
MY COMMUNITY WHICH IS A BIG DEAL

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:21.001
PEOPLE THINK OF MONTEREY COUNTY

01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:22.469
AND PROBABLY YOU THOUGHT OF

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:23.671
PEBBLE BEACH.

01:37:23.737 --> 01:37:25.105
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHERE THE

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:26.273
ACTION IS --

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.808
WE HAVE A A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF

01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:29.610
POVERTY IN OUR AGRICULTURAL

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:30.444
REGION --

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:31.679
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE GROUP THAT

01:37:31.745 --> 01:37:33.314
WERE RESPONDING TO I THINK THIS

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.782
COMMITTEE SHOULD BE THINKING

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:35.549
ABOUT THE PRIVATE INSURANCE

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:36.317
NETWORK.

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:37.952
THOUGH BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:39.286
REALLY DEVELOPED A MODEL IT'S

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:40.888
YOU CAN BE AN EXPENSIVE MODEL

01:37:40.955 --> 01:37:44.792
WHEN YOU HAVE THE COST CARS --

01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:45.626
AND ALL THE TRAINING THAT THEY

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:46.327
HAVE.

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:47.361
BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT THE

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:48.529
PRIVATE INSURANCE NETWORK IS

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:50.064
PROVIDING THAT THE MORE FLUENT

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:51.131
SCHOOLS -- I

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:52.199
THINK THAT'S KIND OF A MARKET

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.167
FAILURE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:55.502
IT'S A LOT OF ANALYSIS TO DO TO

01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:57.304
LOOK AT WHAT SORTS OF STAFFING

01:37:57.371 --> 01:37:58.439
THAT THE PRIVATE INSURANCE

01:37:58.505 --> 01:37:59.540
NETWORK SHOULD BE INVESTING IN

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:00.674
IN SCHOOLS WE KNOW IT'S THE

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:01.742
RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:38:01.809 --> 01:38:03.210
RIGHT SO.

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:04.645
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY WE WANT TO

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:05.913
COME TO ANDREAS YEAR PROGRAM.

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.014
SO YOU CAN BUT THERE'S REALLY

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:09.383
NOTHING TO SEE IT'S THEIR BEST

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:10.951
SOMETIMES IN CLOSETS RIGHT.

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:12.419
IT'S BEGINNING A RELATIONSHIP

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:14.088
EVENTUALLY THEY THEY GET ENOUGH

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:15.389
STEAM TO GET AN OFFICE.

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:17.224
BUT WE'RE NOT WEARING BADGES

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.125
THAT SAY --

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:19.026
MENTAL HEALTH YOU GUYS

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:21.128
UNDERSTAND THE SCARCITY OF

01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:22.930
SCHOOL SPACE --

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:23.897
WERE NOT WEARING BADGES THE SAME

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:24.865
MENTAL HEALTH ARE AT THE JOB OF

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:26.267
OUR THERAPIST IS TO INTEGRATE

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:27.901
INTO THE SCHOOL CLIMATE CULTURES

01:38:27.968 --> 01:38:29.670
THERE'S NOT STIGMA ABOUT --

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:31.005
IF SOMEONE'S.

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:32.306
GET ENGAGING IN THERAPEUTIC

01:38:32.373 --> 01:38:33.474

WEARING SCHOOL BADGES AND

01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:36.377
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE EATING

LUNCH WITH TEACHERS IN THE BREAK

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:39.613
ROOM RIGHT SO UNDERSTANDING SOME

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.514
OF THE STUDENTS DOING

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:41.849
CONSULTATION ABOUT KIDS THAT

01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:42.816
THEY'RE STARTING TO NOTICE

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:45.052
PROBLEMS WITH. TO THINK ABOUT

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:45.686
YOU KNOW THAT EARLY EXPOSURE TO

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:48.722

01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:38.098
IT'S PRETTY ADORABLE TO SEE A

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:38.665
ROOM FULL OF FIVE YEAR OLDS

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:40.501

NO ONE'S LOSING IN THAT

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:43.137
SITUATION.%

01:40:43.203 --> 01:40:43.971
SO -- THAT'S

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:45.939
REALLY THE THE KEY POINTS THAT I

01:40:46.006 --> 01:40:47.975
WANTED TO SAY IS YOU KNOW THE

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:50.577
OVERALL BUSINESS MODEL --

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:52.012
THERE'S JUST SO IMPORTANT TO LET

01:40:52.079 --> 01:40:53.480
TEACHERS WE REALLY GET TO BE

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:54.782
TEACHERS AND INVESTING COUNTY

01:40:54.848 --> 01:40:56.283
BEHAVIOR HEALTH EVEN OUR FUNDING

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:57.651
IS COMPLICATED YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:58.952
ALL EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:00.187
PAYMENT REFORM AND WHAT THAT

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:00.988
WILL DO.

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:02.055
I THINK THE FUTURE IS REALLY

01:41:02.122 --> 01:41:04.091
TRANSFORMATIVE SYSTEM OR WE GET

01:41:04.158 --> 01:41:05.592
RID OF THAT PAPERWORK BURDEN.

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:06.693
AND THEN MY THERAPIST THAT ARE

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.429
IN THE SCHOOLS I COULD GET 30%

01:41:08.495 --> 01:41:09.930
MORE PRODUCTIVITY FROM THEM IF I

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:11.398
COULD GET RID OF SOME OF THOSE

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:13.066
DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS --

01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:14.301

ENCOURAGE LITTLE BIT OF RISK.

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:19.840
BECAUSE WE'RE SERVING UP PRETTY

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:22.209
BROAD DEFINITION OF WHO WHO WE

01:41:22.276 --> 01:41:23.110
HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM BECAUSE

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:23.944
TECHNICALLY IT'S SOME OF THESE

01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:25.612
KIDS SHOULD BE SENT OVER TO THE

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:27.347

SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:41:32.319 --> 01:41:33.086
WE EXPERIENCE IN THIS

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:34.588
COLLABORATION AND MAYBE WHY --

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:36.356

MOST SUCCESSFUL HIGH SCHOOL

01:43:53.193 --> 01:43:55.095

THE PAST YEAR --

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.572
BEING RURAL THERE IS A SHORTAGE

01:44:05.639 --> 01:44:06.340
OVERALL SHORTAGE OF MENTAL

IT WORKS TRANSPORTATION IS

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:36.269
DIFFICULT IF A FAMILY MEMBER

THAT THEY DO RECEIVE BY SEEING A

REALLY BAD OUTCOMES WHEN IT

COMES TO SCHOOL.

02:00:10.636 --> 02:00:11.671

BUT THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING THE

02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:19.979
CARE THAT THEY NEED AND WE THINK

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:22.248
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE INCREASED

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:24.016

CRITICAL AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:38.431
CHILDREN DO HAVE MEDICAL
