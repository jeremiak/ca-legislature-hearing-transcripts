IS A TWO ZERO THANK YOU THAT BILL PASSES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE ON AN EIGHT TO ZERO VOTE. NOW WILL RETURN TO THE FAIR PLAN THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO I JUST A QUICK RECAP HERE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT BY STATUTE SO WE'VE BEEN AROUND FIFTY ONE YEARS. WE WERE CHARGED WITH FOR PURPOSES ONE CREATED FIRST WAS TO ASSURE THE STABILITY AND THE PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET MORTGAGES IN ORDER TO GET A MORTGAGE YOU NEED AN INSURANCE POLICY OUR POLICY SATISFIES THAT MORTGAGE REQUIREMENT. A NUMBER TWO WAS TO ASSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF BASIC PROPERTY INSURANCE YOU KNOW WE WRITE A NO FEELS NO FRILLS PRODUCT AND AGAIN WE KIND OF WITH THAT WOULD SATISFY THAT SECOND REQUIREMENT THIRD TO ENCOURAGE THE MAXIMUM USE OF IN OBTAINING BASIC PROPERTY INSURANCE OF THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET OTHER THE- INSURANCE COULD ACTUALLY DEFINES THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET AS BOTH ADMITTED CARRIERS AND SURPLUS LINES CARRIERS. AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE NORMAL MARKET THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE FAIR PLAN THE ABNORMAL MARKET. JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT. IN ALSO LASTLY TO INSURE QUALIFIED PROPERTY FOR WHICH BASIC PROPERTY INSURANCE CANNOT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET. WE'RE THERE FOR YOU WE WILL WRITE ANYWHERE IN THE STATE WE WERE AS LONG AS THE PROPERTY IS IN TROUBLE CONDITIONAL GOING TO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE LATER. BUT THE REASON PEOPLE DON'T TEND TO KNOW ABOUT THE FAIR PLAN EITHER IS BECAUSE. YOU ONLY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT US WHEN YOU CAN'T GET INSURANCE ELSEWHERE SO THE LAST TIME THE FAIR PLAN WAS SORT OF. YOU KNOW IN THE PRESS IF YOU WILL GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION WAS AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WHEN THE INSURANCE MARKET KINDA SEIZED UP SO THAT'S ABOUT THE LAST TIME THE FAIR PLAN WAS REALLY. YOU KNOW IN THE LIMELIGHT IF YOU WILL BECAUSE WE WERE THERE TO FILL IN THE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE THERE WAS AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A REAL DIFFICULT IN THE ENTIRE STATE TO ATTEMPT INSURANCE. WE'RE SEEING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT NOW SO AGAIN THIS IS NOW WHY THE FAIR PLAN KEEPS BUBBLING UP I'M OCCASIONALLY ASKED IF WE ADVERTISE IN THE ANSWER IS NO NOBODY SHOULD KNOW ABOUT US UNLESS THEY CAN'T GET INSURANCE ELSEWHERE SO WE KINDA RUN BELOW THE RADAR. I ALSO FIND MYSELF SAYING REGULARLY THAT I WORK IN OPPOSITE WORLD FOR ME SUCCESS IS DEFINED BY A SHRINKING BOOK OF BUSINESS FOR ME WHEN NOBODY KNOWING ABOUT US IS A GOOD THING. SO IN MANY WAYS WERE SORT OF THE OPPOSITE OF THE OF THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET WERE ABSOLUTELY THERE FOR THE MARKET PLACE WHEN IT NEEDS US BUT IF YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ABOUT US THAT'S A GOOD THING. THAT MEANS WE HAVE A VERY VERY HEALTHY MARKET. MOVING ON THE SIDE THREE. AGAINST LIVERMORE BACKGROUND. FAIR PLAN IS NOT A STATE AGENCY I FIND THAT PEOPLE. SOMETIMES THINK THAT'S THE CASE. RUSSIA PRIVATE ASSOCIATION COMPRISED OF ALL INSURERS. LICENSE TO WRITE PROPERTY INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA SO IF IT'S AN ADMITTED INSURER. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE A CHOICE THEY HAVE TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION. AND WHAT THAT MEANS HIS THOSE SAME COMPANIES ARE ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASSESS THE INSURERS. IF WE NEED MONEY TO PAY CLAIMS NOW THE GOAL IS OF COURSE NOT TO EVER GET IN THAT POSITION WE NEED TO HAVE ACTUALLY SOUND RATES WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PAY LOSSES OVER TIME. THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET IS BUT BASIC AND WE'RE BACK BY THE MARKET SO THERE WILL NEVER BE AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE THE FAIR PLAN CANNOT PAY CLAIMS AND THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POSITION TO BE IN. THERE'S PUBLIC FUNDING NOR TAXPAYER MONEY IS INVOLVED. THIS IS SOMETHING TO THAT PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED TO HEAR WERE VERY SMALL ORGANIZATION WE HAVE LESS THAN SIXTY EMPLOYEES WE ARE A FULL FULL SERVICE INSURANCE COMPANY WAS LESS THAN SIXTY EMPLOYEES WE DO IT ALL. WE WRITE THE BUSINESS WEEK. HANDLE THE CLAIMS WE AYE BY REINSURANCE WE DO PRETTY MUCH. EVERYTHING A NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET AS ONLY WITH A MUCH SMALLER STAFF WE ALSO SERVICE OUR POLICIES MAILER HELP OUR POLICYHOLDERS HELP BRING HELP NEW BROKERS UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE OUR SYSTEM AT CETERA. THE GOOD THING ABOUT SUCH A SMALL STAFF IS WE ALSO HAVE VERY LOW EXPENSES WHICH WERE ABLE TO PASS ALONG A RATES WE WANT TO KEEP OUR EXPENSES DOWN. TO TRY TO KEEP RATES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING MY STAFF TENDS TO CALL ME A BUDGET HAWK AND THEY'RE RIGHT. MY GOAL IS TO LET'S KEEP EXPENSES DOWN AGAIN SO WE DON'T HAVE TO PASS THAT ON. IN PREMIUM. MOVING ON A PAGE FOR SO WHERE DOES THE FAIR PLAN RIGHT. FAIR PLAN RIGHTS IN ANY LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES INCLUDING. OF THE HOUSE MUST BE AN INSURABLE CONDITION WHAT THAT MEANS IS BASICALLY NO ON REPAIR DAMAGE IT'S A PRETTY LOW BAR SO. HOME CAN'T BE VACANT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. AGAIN NOT SOMETHING WITHIN THE CONTROL THE HOMEOWNER AND NOT ATTRACTS A WHOLE LOT OF. LOS ACTIVITY AND SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR RULES AND LASTLY NO ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES CAN TAKE PLACE AT THE PROPERTY IN YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT WE SEE AND WHAT WE FIND WITH INSPECTIONS BUT WE WON'T WRITE THOSE POLICIES. FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES WE WRITE JUST ABOUT ANYTHING SO AGAIN WE WILL WRITE I TELL PEOPLE THIS ALL THE TIME I WILL WRITE A WOOD CABIN WITH THE WOOD ROOF IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST WITH NO FIRE PROTECTION. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THERE FOR. I WILL ALSO WRITE PROPERTIES THAT AREN'T THAT EXTREME. BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON. CAN'T GET INSURANCE ELSEWHERE THAT'S OUR ROLE IN THE MARKETPLACE IS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET IS STABLE THAT PEOPLE CAN IN FACT GET INSURANCE WE ARE THERE FOR THEM. SO THERE WILL NEVER BE A SITUATION WHERE A POLICY HOLDER WHO YOU KNOW. HOUSE A HOUSE THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW. THAT DOES HAVE A REPAIR DAMAGE OR THAT THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW DOING THEIR THEY DON'T A METH LAB WHAT YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MANY OF THOSE WE FIND. AND THE HOUSE HAS BEEN VACANT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THERE FOR WE WILL WRITE YOU. SO I JUST WANT TO KIND OF PUT EVERYBODY'S MIND IT IS WE CAN DEFINITELY MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE TAKEN CARE OF. AND PROBABLY WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT THESE DAYS IS WE WILL ENSURE A PROPERTY REGARDLESS OF ITS EXPOSURE TO BRUSH WILD FIRE. AGAIN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THERE FOR. WE WILL NEVER TURN AWAY PROPERTY BASED ON LOCATION THAT IS NOT ONE OF OUR CRITERIA. WE WILL WRITE WHAT EVER. A CUSTOMER NEEDS US TO WRITE ON A PROPERTY. AGAIN THIS GOES BACK TO OUR PURPOSE THAT WHITE SORT OF START WITH THE FOR PURPOSES OF THE FAIR PLAN TO ASSURE STABILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE AND TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY AND MARK PLACE WE TAKE THOSE THAT ROLE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. SO MOVING ON THE SIDE FIVE. WELL MORE OF WHERE THE FAIR PLAN RIGHT. CAN WE WRITE ALL PROPERTIES INCLUDING HIGH RISK PROPERTIES REGARDLESS OF CONCENTRATIONS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CONCENTRATIONS LATELY WE DO NOT. CONSIDER CONCENTRATIONS WHEN WE WRITE POLICIES IF WE HAVE TO WRITE ALL TEN HOMES ACTUALLY WE PROBABLY HAVE THIS WE WRITE A LOT OF POLICIES IN MALIBU MALIBU. FOR MANY MANY DECADES HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BUILD MELBOURNE'S EVERY SO OFTEN I THINK THAT'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN WE READ A LOT OF POLICIES AMOUNT WILL WRITE EVERY SINGLE POLICY IN A ZIP CODE IF NEED BE WE DON'T CONSIDER CONCENTRATION OF POLICIES AGAIN THAT WOULD BE COUNTER TORE PURPOSE IN THE% MARKETPLACE. SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF POLICIES IN CERTAIN POCKETS OF THE STATE BUT AGAIN I STRESS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THERE FOR NOW THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING AT SPREADING THE RISK OUT WHICH CANDIDLY IS A VERY SMART THING TO DO FROM A LOS PERSPECTIVE. BUT AGAIN FROM WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM WE WILL NOT WE WILL NOT TURN ANYBODY AWAY BECAUSE WERE WRITING TOO MANY PROPERTIES IN THAT AREA THAT WOULD NEVER OCCUR WITH US AND AGAIN ON TOP OF THAT WILL ALSO READ THE HIGHER RISK PROP. PROPERTIES WILL WRITE A WOULD ROOF. YOU KNOW THERE A LOT OF COMPANIES WON'T UNDERSTANDABLY. WILL WRITE A WOULD ROOF IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST IF NEED BE AGAIN WE WRITE THE HIGH RISK WE RIGHT CONCENTRATIONS. HOWEVER MOVING ON TO PAGE SIX. NOW I'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT BRUSH WILDFIRE BUT THE FAIR PLAN HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN AND URBAN WRITER OF BUSINESS IN FACT 61% OF OUR BUSINESS TODAY. IS URBAN BUSINESS WE WRITE HELLO IN FACT ABOUT 80% ACTUALLY THE LESSON ABOUT 75% OF OUR BUSINESS IS IT IS IN LA COUNTY WE WRITE. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF URBAN BUSINESS STILL THE MAJORITY OF WHAT WE WRITE SO WHEN PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THE FAIR PLAN THEY DON'T ALWAYS THINK THAT. BUT THE URBAN CUSTOMER IS OUR CORE CUSTOMER STILL AT THIS POINT. WE ENSURE TWO POINT 7% OF THE HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN HIGH AN EXTREME WHILE FOR RISK AREAS. WHAT THAT MEANS IS NINETY SEVEN POINT 3% OF THE HOUSING STOCK IN THOSE AREAS ARE WRITTEN BY THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG STATISTICS SO WE'RE THERE FOR THE FOR THE SMALL. NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY NEED US BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THE VOLUNTARY MARKET IS STILL VERY VERY ACTIVE IN THESE AREAS NOT THAT'S A SIGN OF A HEALTHY VOLUNTEER MARKET. NOW THAT SAYS WE HAVE GROWN. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DWELLING POLICIES IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS NOW THAT'S LET ME PUT THAT IN CONTEXT FOR YOU SINCE TAKING OVER THE FAIR PLAN ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE'VE BEEN STEADILY DECLINING ABOUT ANYWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED POLICIES A MONTH. SORT OF A SLOW. SLOWED DROP OFF IN THE LAST MONTH WE'VE GROWN. SO. DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT THIS NUMBER THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS NUMBER IS OKAY I SAW THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SACRAMENTO BEE THIS MORNING AND SAID THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POLICIES WERE NON RENEWED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY UNIFORMLY PICKING UP TWENTY TWO THOUSAND OF THOSE. THAT MEANS WE STILL VERY HEALTHY VOLUNTARY MARKET AND ALSO MEANS. THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING BECAUSE THESE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND CUSTOMERS ARE COMING TO US WHEN THEY NEED US SO AGAIN OVERALL THE SYSTEM IS WORKING IF I COULD AND BY THE WAY ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF THE- SPEAKERS OF A PLEASE GO AHEAD NASCO. OR MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THE SPEAKERS FINISHED BUT ON THAT POINT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OR WHATEVER THAT THREE HUNDRED PLUS THOUSAND THAT'S OVER A PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS CORRECT YOU KNOW I JUST SAW THAT THE HEADLINE SO I YEAH. YOU DON'T THEIR SUMMARIZING ACCUMULATIVE NUMBERS OVER I THINK IT WAS A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T SQUARE WITH THE NUMBER THAT YOU JUST GAVE US FOR THE PAST YEARS INCREASE. OKAY THAT POINT TAKEN AGAIN I JUST READ THE HIGH JUST READ THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WELL LIKE I SAY YEAH. THEY'LL BE OTHERS SPEAKERS TALKING ON THE DATA THIS MORNING AND WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO. SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION I GUESS ABSOLUTELY PLEASE COULD YOU PLEASE CONTINUE THE BATON SO WHAT I CAN POINT TO FACTUALLY AND ACCURATELY IS THAT WE'VE GROWN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND ONE I. WANTED ONE POLICIES IN LAST YEAR WELL. NOW LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR FOR THOSE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. IT FEELS LIKE AN AVAILABILITY CRISIS. I'M NOT GONNA DO MINIMIZE HOW THESE PEOPLE MUST FEEL ABOUT THE INSURANCE AVAILABILITY FOR THEIR PROPERTY IT'S PROBABLY A REALLY BAD FEELING BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS. THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CUSTOMERS WHO'VE BEEN NON RENEWED BY THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY CAM FIND INSURANCE ELSEWHERE IN FACT IF YOU LOOK THE LAST BULLET ON THE PAGE. WHICH NEW BUSINESS OVER TIME AND HAVE BEEN SINCE LAST NOVEMBER YOU CAN WELL IMAGINE WE WERE EXPECTING A AN INCREASE IN BUSINESS AFTER THE CAMP WOLSELEY FIRES. AM THE POLICIES THAT WE WROTE AS NEW BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER. ALMOST ONE OUT OF FIVE OF THOSE POLICIES ARE NO LONGER WITH US BY THE END OF JULY. THAT'S A VERY STRONG STATISTIC WHAT THAT TELLS ME WHAT I TAKE FROM THE STATISTIC IS THAT PEOPLE ARE PANIC BUYING FROM US. AND THAT'S EXACTLY OUR ROLE WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO GO WITHOUT INSURANCE NO MATTER HOW LONG IF IT'S A IF IT'S A DAY IF IT'S A WEEK OF ITS A MONTH. THEY SHOULDN'T GO WITHOUT PROPERTY INSURANCE AND THEY ARE WELCOME TO AND THEY ARE ABLE TO COME TO THE FAIR PLAN AND GET INSURANCE. UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. OR CANDIDLY THE TIME BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE TIME TO SHOP AROUND AND GET INSURANCE ELSEWHERE I CAN SPEAK FOR THE TIME I REASON I'M I'M AN INSURANCE CUSTOMER I RECENTLY WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS I. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT SO EASY TO GO OUT AND SHOP AROUND AND GET NEW INSURANCE SO IT'S NOT A SIMPLE THING TO DO NECESSARILY. BUT AGAIN THE GOOD THING IS ALMOST ONE IN FIVE OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE MANAGED TO PLACE INSURANCE OR LEAVE THE FAIR PLAN. SO PRESUMABLY GET INSURANCE WITH ANOTHER COMPANY AGAIN A VERY SOLID STAT BUT ALSO IT SHOWS ONCE AGAIN THE SYSTEMS WORKING CUSTOMERS ARE COMING TO US WHEN THEY NEED US. AND THEY LEAVE WHEN THEY NO LONGER DO. SO THAT'S A GOOD THING. YEAH I WORKING OPPOSITE WORLD WE'RE TRYING TO HELP COST LEAVE THE FAIR PLAN. SO MOVING ON TO SLIDE SEVEN. WHAT DO WE WRITE WELL IN A NOT SHOW WE WRITE WHAT THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET WON'T. AND WHAT IS IT THEY WON'T WRITE. FIRE. SO THINK OF US AS BEING ME. EARTHQUAKE WRITER OF YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF EARTHQUAKE WE WRITE FIRE THIS IS A PERIL THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN SOME AREAS IS HESITANT TO WRITE AGAIN THAT'S OUR ROLE WE WRITE A BASIC PROPERTY. PER THE YOU KNOW THE PURPOSES OF THE FAIR PLAN A BASIC INSURANCE POLICY RIGHT FIRE EXTENDED COVERAGE IN VMM VMM IS VANDALISM MALICIOUS MISCHIEF EXTENDED COVERAGE WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE WIND AND SOME YOU KNOW SOME OTHER MINOR COVERAGES BUT. OUR PRIMARY PERIL WHAT WE WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WE DO WHAT WE ADJUST WHAT WE TAKE CARE OF CUSTOMERS WITH DAY IN AND DAY OUT IS FIRE. THAT'S OUR CORE PRODUCT. WELL RIGHT THOSE BRUSH WILDFIRE EXPOS POLICIES WERE RIGHT OLDER HOMES THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A BIG URBAN BOOK. WE HAVE A LOT OF POLICIES ON THE BOOK A LOT OF PROPERTIES ON THE BOOKS THAT ARE MORE THAN EIGHTY YEARS OLD THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN ATTRACTIVE PROPERTY FOR A- YOU KNOW A VOLUNTARY A NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET. BUT AGAIN WILL WRITE IT. I WILL ALSO WRITE. PROPERTIES THAT HAVE BASICALLY NO FIRE PROTECTION I DON'T HAVE A FIRE DEPARTMENT WITHIN FIVE MILES OF THEIR HOME. THERE'S NO FIRE RESPONSE ABSOLUTELY WE WILL WRITE THEM. AND WE'RE NOT WE HAVE A LOT OF POLICIES WE WRITE A LOT OF PROPERTIES AT STILL HAVE NOT BEEN TO WIRING NOT AN ATTRACTIVE ABSOLUTELY NOT ATTRACTIVE RISK FOR A VOLUNTARY WRITER. BUT AGAIN WE FILL THE NEED. TO GIVE THOSE FOLKS INSURANCE SO WE WILL WRITE KNOB AND TUBE WIRING. SO MOVING ON TO PAY DATE SO WHAT DOES THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET RIGHT WELL VIS A VIS THE POLICIES THAT WE WRITE. OF THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET WRITES A DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION POLICY. NOW WHAT THAT TYPICALLY LOOKS LIKE IS A COMPANY WILL TAKE THEIR HOMEOWNER'S POLICY AND ADD AN ENDORSEMENT TO IT NOT ENDORSEMENT SOMETIMES SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THIS POLICY COVERS EVERYTHING EXCEPT WHAT THE FAIR PLAN RIGHT TO COULD BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE OF THAT IS THAT I'VE SEEN LANGUAGE AS SIMPLE AS THAT. I'VE SEEN LANGUAGE THAT TALKS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WE EXCLUDE FIRED WEEKS WITH EXTENDED COVERAGE WE EXCLUDE VANDALISM UNLESS AS MR SUMMER MORE COMPREHENSIVE SUMMER OTHERS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY ALL MEAN THE SAME THING. THEY'LL COVER. EVERYTHING ELSE OF HOMEOWNERS POLICY. COVERS EXCEPT FOR THE FIRE BECAUSE THE FIRE PIECE. THAT CAN BE PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK IN CERTAIN AREAS AGAIN. I KEEP STRESSING THIS POINT BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR WE RIGHT THE FIRE PIECE THIS IS WHAT THE MARKET DOESN'T NECESSARILY ONE RIGHT. NOW IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING THAT WE HAVE SO MANY COMPANIES WHO RIGHT DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICIES BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU HAVE THIS MUCH COMPETITION YOU END UP WITH PRICE COMPETITION. SO THESE COMPANIES ARE OUT THERE. THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEIR MULTI LINE CUSTOMER THEY DON'T WANNA LOSE THE CUSTOMER WHO HAS THEIR THREE HOT THREE AUTOS THEIR HOME THEIR UMBRELLA POLICY THEIR LIFE POLICY THEY DON'T WANT TO MISTER LOSE THAT CUSTOMER. SO THOUGH RIGHT A DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION POLICY ALONGSIDE A FAIR PLAN POLICY AND THEY CAN KEEP THAT CUSTOMER AND WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT. IS THAT CUSTOMER GETS TO KEEP THEIR AUTO HOME DISCOUNT WHICH IS IT IN MANY IN MOST CASES IS A SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS. WHAT KEEPS THE RELATIONSHIP INTACT BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL COVERING EVERYTHING THAT THEY- ARE WILLING TO COVER NAMELY NOT FIRE. AND THE CUSTOMER MAINTAINS THEIR MULTI LINE DISCOUNT SO THIS IS A REALLY GOOD THING AND THAT. I ACTUALLY WORK VERY CLOSE IN FACT LAST WEEK I WORK WITH A VERY LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT'S NOT ON THIS PAGE. WORKING WITH THEM ON GIVING THEM I DO THIS PRETTY REGULARLY BY THE WAY. WORKING WITH THEM AND GIVING THEM IDEAS ON HOW TO STRUCTURE THEIR POLICY THINGS TO CONSIDER THINGS THINGS HELP WHAT THE SIZE OF THE MARKET MIGHT BE ETCETERA ETCETERA. SO I SPENT A LOT OF TIME. ACTUALLY DRUMMING UP BUSINESS FOR MY CUSTOMERS. WITH THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET AGAIN IT'S SORT OF OPPOSITE WORLD. THERE'S NEVER ANY HAVE EVER THERE'S NEVER ANY AND I TRUST I ONLY SPEAK TO ONE INSURANCE COMPANY IN A TIME OF COURSE. BUT I GO OUT AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY I KNOW CLIFTON. I'VE REACHED OUT TO CLOSE IN THE SAY HEY WHAT CAN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET DO FOR FAIR FIND CUSTOMERS WHAT CAN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET DO FOR. THIS NEED THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR THE FAIR PLAN CUSTOMER THIS IS AFTER THE FIRST TIME CLOSE TONIGHT AND I HAVE MET IN PERSON BUT I HAVE HAD. LOTS OF CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIM I'VE CORRESPONDENCE WITH MANY COMPANIES. TRYING TO MAKE. AVAILABILITY MORE. MORE AVAILABLE TO MAKE POLICIES MORE AVAILABLE TO MY CUSTOMERS BECAUSE AGAIN FOR ME A SHRINKING BOOK OF BUSINESS. IS A GOOD THING SO MUCH OF MY ROLE IS TO LIKE I SAID HELP THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET WHICH AGAIN IS DEFINED AS ADMITTED CARRIERS AND SURPLUS LINES CARRIERS. TO CONSIDER PRODUCTS EITHER SUPPLEMENT THE FAIR PLAN POLICY OR ENCOURAGE THEM TO SOMEHOW. TAKE SOME OF THE POLICIES FROM US I DON'T ACTUALLY GIVEN THAT POLICY INFORMATION BUT I TRY TO ENCOURAGE THEM. TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND IT'S SEVERAL OF THESE COMPANIES THAT WRITE D. I. C.'S I'VE ACTUALLY DEALT WITH SEVERAL OF THEM. MY BELIEVE IN OTHER ONES GOING TO BE COMING OUT WITH SOME ONE FILING FOR ONE SOON SO I'M HAPPY TO SAY THERE'S GOOD COMPETITION IN THIS SPACE. SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT ASKING THE FAIR PLAN TO WRITE A PACKAGE HOMEOWNERS POLICY. AND THE ANALOGY I WOULD DRAW IT BE LIKE ASKING THE FLOOD INSURANCE. PROGRAM TO WRITE THE PACKAGE HOMEOWNERS POLICY WE SPECIALIZE IN FIRE. THAT'S KIND OF OUR WHEEL HOUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO. ASKING US TO WRITE ALL THESE OTHER THINGS A THE WATER THE PFAFF THE LIABILITY. BELIEVE IT OR NOT THOSE ARE COMPLETELY THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT UGH. LINE OF INSURANCE IF YOU WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE WE DON'T HAVE THE WE'RE NOT THE CLAIMS KNOWLEDGE WE DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEMS WE DON'T THERE'S- WOULD HAVE TO KIND OF BUILD EVERYTHING FROM THE GROUND UP. AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IS WELL OUR EXPENSES WOULD GO UP OF COURSE AND SO. RATHER THAN COMPETE WITH THE VOLUNTARY MARKET WHICH IS AGAIN. PER THE YOU KNW THE FOR PURPOSES OF THE FAIR PLAN TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. SO I DO WANT TO COMPETE WITH THEM. SO I SEE MY ROLE IS BEING GETTING THE VOLUNTARY MARKET TO WRITE MORE OF THESE DE I SEE POLICIES AND CREATE EVEN MORE COMPETITION. BETWEEN THOSE COMPANIES. RECENTLY I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO CONSIDER WRITING A LIABILITY. LIABILITY COVERAGE ON ON THE AFFAIR PLAN. OF PLATFORM AGAIN LIABILITY IS LIKE. HENCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPLES AND ORANGES IT'S A IT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S ALL HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AGAIN I'D BE LIKE ASKING THE FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM RIGHT A PACKAGE NUMBERS POLICY THEY REALLY ARE APPLES AND ORANGES. THE GOOD NEWS IS THOUGH I'VE BEEN ABLE TO. IDENTIFY THREE IN THE FOURTH WILL BE COMING THIS WEEK. COMPANIES THAT WRITE A STANDALONE C. P. L. POLICY THAT HAVE THE EXPERTISE THAT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. I PUT THE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE I'VE- PUSH THE INFORMATION OUT TO OUR BROKERS AND I ACTUALLY. SPENT A LOT OF TIME MAKING SURE THAT THE CORRESPONDENCE THAT GOES TO OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH AT NEW BUSINESS AND RENEWAL. YOU KNOW SUGGESTS TO THEM THAT THEY SHOULD CONSIDER A DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY WE'RE ABOUT TO UPDATE THAT AS WELL FOR LIABILITY SO WE DO A LOT OF DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. AND WE TRY TO MAKE WE TRY TO EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE TRY TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION POLICIES AND THE LIABILITY ONLY POLICIES. KNOWN TO AND AVAILABLE TO THE BROKERS WHO PLACE BUSINESS WITH THAT SO IT'S SOMETHING I CARE VERY STRONGLY ABOUT AND IT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE FILLING THAT NEED. SO MOVING. IT'S NOT ANOTHER THING WE RECENTLY DID. WE WERE ASKED TO INCREASE OUR DWELLING. LIMIT FROM ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. TO THREE MILLION. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNING COMMITTEE HAS APPROVED THAT AND WE ARE ACTUALLY NEED DEEP. IN DURING AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS TO GET OUR RATES TO GET RATE SET UP FOR THAT TO. PROGRAMMERS SYSTEMS WE'RE LOOKING TO FILE A RATE FILING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE EARLY OCTOBER. AND I KNOW THAT THEIR EAGER FOR THIS AS WELL AND I. YOU KNOW I WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM THEY'RE GREAT TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW WE'LL JUST WE'LL GET THIS THIS APPROVE WE NEED RIGHT TO PROVE WE CAN'T JUST. YOU KNOW. BUT RATES OUT THERE IN THAT YOU KNOW NOT DO ANYTHING. WE'RE HAVING TO UNDO MANY YEARS OF PROGRAMMING THOUGH BECAUSE- WE HAVE THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT IN PLACE FOR SO LON THAT IT'S HARD CODED INTO MANY PARTS OF OUR SYSTEMS LIKE. TO MAKE SURE I GO OVER MILLION FIVE AND SO WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY. ALL THOSE LOCATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN IN THERE FOR DECADES SO. WE'RE WE'RE DOING A LOT OF YOU KNOW SEARCHING AT THE MOMENT FOR OUR SYSTEM. NOW WE'RE TARGETING AN APRIL FIRST EFFECTIVE DATE THAT'S PROBABLY TO SOME PEOPLE SOUNDS LIKE A LONG WAY OUT CANDIDLY I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER TO HAVE THEM TO HAVE THAT AVAILABLE. YESTERDAY THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS A FOUR ONE EFFECTIVE DATE MEANS EVERYTHING HAS TO BE LOCKED DOWN. BY FEBRUARY FIRST BECAUSE RENEWALS HAVE TO GO OUT. AND THEN IF YOU WORK BACKWARDS FROM THERE AND I'VE I PUT THIS GANTT CHART IN HERE FOR YOUR INFORMATION. THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE BUT WERE WERE PUSHING OURSELVES BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A MARKET NEED FOR THIS. HOLD UP ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT BE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IT WOULD BE US BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WOULD CERTAINLY TURN THIS AROUND QUICKLY. SO WE ARE. YOU KNOW PUSHING ON ALL ANGLES THIS IS SOMETHING I PUSH ON MY I. T. TEAM IN THE ACTUARIAL TEAM. THAT'S DOING ANALYSIS FOR US PROBABLY EVERY OTHER DAY. SO WE ARE WE ARE. BARRELING FORWARD ON THIS TO FILL THIS NEED. THAT WE. WE SEE THAT THE- THE CUSTOMERS HAVE AND WHILE I'M DOING THAT TO I'M ACTUALLY WORKING WITH ONE OF THE SURPLUS LINES CARRIERS. WHO HAS BEEN. WORKING TO SECURE CAPACITY WITH LLOYDS OF LONDON AND THEY KEEP ASSURING ME THEY'RE VERY CLOSE AS SOON AS THAT ACCESS PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE I WILL NOTIFY ALL OF OUR BROKERS OF THAT SO THAT THEY HAVE A RELIEF VALVE IN THE INTERIM. SO AGAIN WE DO I TRY TO BE VERY RESPONSIVE TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO THE NEEDS OF THE CUSTOMERS WHILE STILL. WORKING WITHIN THOSE FOR PURPOSES THAT WERE LAID OUT FOR THE FAIR PLAN WHEN WE WERE CREATED. SO WELL THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT SUMMARY WITH VERY HELPFUL. DATA. TIME LINES AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE VERY WELCOME GIOVANE. WHETHER ANY QUESTIONS SIR. FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE FAIR PLAN AT THIS POINT THEY'LL GO AHEAD MR VOEPEL. YES AND I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING WITH YOU AND HELPING OUT OTHER AGENTS AND BROKERS SO. GREAT WORK THANK YOU A COUPLE OF TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. NOW THE ABILITY TO ASSESS THE INSURERS THE FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOW IS THAT A ROUTINE ASSESSMENT THAT YOU DO PERIODICALLY TO SET THE RATES AND SET THE RISK FACTORS OR WHAT OKAY GREAT QUESTION ACTUALLY THE ANSWER IS NO IT'S NOT SOMETHING IS DONE ROUTINELY THE LAST TIME THE FAIR PLAN HAD TO ASSESS THE MEMBER COMPANIES WAS. AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE SO THERE WERE A SUCCESSION OF CATASTROPHE AND THEN WHEN THE MALIBU FIRES THE ALTADENA PASADENA FIRES AND THEN NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE AND THE ASSESSMENT TOLD I WANT TO SAY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO YOU ONE LAST THE ONE QUESTION. IF YOU ASSESS ALL THE CARRIERS. THE CARRIERS HAVE TO PASS THAT ON SOME HOW THROUGH RATES CORRECT SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAS TO APPROVE THE RATES YES SO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAS TO APPROVE ANY ASSESSMENT OKAY SO I CAN ASSUME THAT THERE IS A CHECK IN A BALANCE THERE WOULD THAT BE A CORRECT ASSUMPTION ABSOLUTELY IN FACTAN ASSESSMENT WHAT WE TRY TO DO AT THE FAIR PLAN IS WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD OUR CAPITAL SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO AN ASSESSMENT SO RIGHT NOW. WE'RE LITTLE SHORT ON CAPITAL WE HAVE THE CAMPAñA LOYALTY FIRES AND YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED HERE WE WEREN'T THAT AFFECTED BY THE CAMPFIRE WE ARE LOSSES WERE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE WALLS THE FIRE AND I MENTIONED EARLIER MALIBU Mà I'M KIND OF THE ENSURE OF CHOICE IN MALIBU RIGHT NOW SO WE HAD A HUGE LOSS IN MALIBU NOT SO MUCH IN CAN'T WE JUST WEREN'T WRITING THEIR. SO THAT DEPLETED OUR CAPITAL IN FACT NET OF RESERVES WE WERE IN THE RED HOWEVER WE HAD ENOUGH CASH ON HAND TO PAY CLAIMS AND TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING CAPITAL NOT OF RESERVES. THANK YOU MISTER GOOD. GOOD QUESTIONS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. FOR MISTER VON AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT TO MISTER GALLAGHER REPRESENTS A DISTRICT TO WHICH HAS BEEN HARD HIT BY THE FIRES AND HE ASKED IF HE COULD JOIN OUR COMMITTEE TODAY SO HE'S HERE A. ON A ON A CARE FOR THE INFORMATION HEARING SO GO AHEAD SIR IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR LET ME JOIN THIS MORNING OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK FOR ALL OF US BUT CERTAINLY IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE CAMPFIRE. IN MY DISTRICT AND EVEN AREAS THAT WEREN'T AFFECTED BY CAMPFIRE WILL WISH WE ARE SEEN NON RENEWALS AND WERE SEEN. NO SPIKES IN PREMIUMS THAT OBVIOUS HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON EDGE. WITH PARTICULAR REGARD TO THE FAIR PLAN I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING. YOUR NOT NECESSARILY NEGATIVE ON THE FAIR PLAN ITSELF BUT RATHER THAT WHEN THAT BECOMES A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE NOBODY ELSE. WILLING TO WRITE A POLICY ANYA AND FAIR IS THE ONLY IS THE MEAL INSURER OF LAST RESORT WHICH IS AS YOU SAID IS YOUR PURPOSE. PEOPLE GET THE INCH THAT PLAN BUT THEN THEY ABSOLUTELY NEED TO GET ADDITIONAL INSURANCE AND SO THEY GO OUT FOR A D. I. C. OR SUPPLEMENTAL AND FROM WHAT I'M HEARING THAT IS REALLY WHAT. IS THE HUGE EXPENSE FOR PEOPLE. VERY IN DIFFERENT DEGREES BUT I'M HERE MORE LIKE MAYBE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR THE FAIR PLAN YOU KNOW BASIC PLAN BUT THEN. WHAT COULD GET THEM UP TO A TOTAL MAYBE NINE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IS THE D. IC PLAN. AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GETTING SOME OF THIS. THE PUSH BACK AND PEOPLE ARE SAME WAY WILL MAYBE. COULD FAIR PLAN ACTUALLY MAYBE. THROUGH A BY UP NOT JUST. FOR THE SAME PRICE BUT MAY FOR BUYING UP ON THE EXISTING BASIC PLAN. INCORPORATE IN SOME OF THESE OTHER METRICS AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME. OTHER WITNESSES LATER THIS MORNING ON THAT IDEA BUT I MEAN I HEARD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT HEY THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WERE. GEARED UP TO DO. BUT IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE THAT OUT THERE IN THE MARKET. IS NOT MAYBE THERE ARE THERE ARE PLANS BUT ARE THEY AFFORDABLE. YOU KNOW WITHIN REASONABLE REACH OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW LIVING IN SOME OF THESE AREAS SURE AND THAT'S AN AND- AFFORDABILITY IS A VERY REAL CONCERN I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICIES ARE ABOUT MUCH. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY MARKET FOR DISTANT DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY YOU KNOW I PUT ON. ON THE SLIDE OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE LISTED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WEBSITE OF COMPANIES THAT CURRENTLY RIGHT A DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY. THE GOOD THING ABOUT COMPETITION IS. YOU CAN USUALLY SHOP AROUND AND GET A BETTER PRICE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYBODY SEEN PRICES LIKE THAT. TO SHOPAROUND BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE FIRE PIECE THAT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLYIT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE FAIR PLAN OF THE FIRE PIECE THAT'S THAT'S DRIVING UP THE TOTAL COSTS BUT IT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION. COST AND AGAIN I WOULD ENCOURAGE THOSE CUSTOMERS TO SHOP AROUND. FOR THE FAIR PLAN TO OFFER SOMETHING LIKE THAT I CAN'T SAY THAT WOULD BE ANY LESS AGAIN KEEPING IN MIND. WHO WE ARE WE TAKE LIKE THE HIGHEST RISK POLICIES AND IN THEORY WE'D PROBABLY BE MORE EXPENSIVE. AND SO. NOT TO MENTION WE'D WE WOULD ENCOURAGE SIGNIFICAN EXPENSES JUST TO GET TO THAT POINT AND THEN WE HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO HANDLE A WATER CLAIM I MEAN. ALL ALL JOKING ASIDE. WE DON'T HANDLE WATER CLAIMS WE DON'T HANDLE THE CLAIMS WE DON'T HANDLE LIABILITY CLAIMS AND SO WE'RE COMPLETELY LACKING ANY OF THAT INFORMATION WHERE IS THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF COMPETITION THEIR NUMBER COMPANIES OUT THERE BOTH SURPLUS LINES MANY SURPLUS LINES COMPANIES IN FACT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET. OF THE PRICES ARE ALL ACROSS THE BOARD SO THE REALLY WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR CUSTARD YOUR YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO DO A SHOP AROUND. BECAUSE THOSE ARE REALLY HIGH PRICES AND I FIND THAT. SURPRISING AND I BUT THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER FOR THEM OUT THERE. MAYBE JUST AS A QUICK FOLLOW UP. MISTER CHAIRMAN IS. AND WE WILL HEAR FROM A GUY WHO THAT'S ALL HE DOES IS SHOPPERS AND SO HILL MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE US SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BUT WOULD WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE I MEAN YOU YOU YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW THIS VERY WELL BUT I MEAN IS THERE A REFORM OUT THERE. THAT MIGHT HELP THIS KIND OF SLIVER OF CUSTOMERS THAT WERE AT THAT I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT WHETHER RUNNING INTO THIS PROBLEM IS THERE REFORM OUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE EVEN TO THE DEPARTMENT OR LEGISLATION OR OTHERWISE. THAT MIGHT HELP THAT SITUATION. I THINK THAT TO I'D I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S NECESSARILY REFORM BUT I'M PLANNING TO CONTINUE MY DRUMBEAT WITH THE VOLUNTARY MARKET TO ASK MORE AND MORE COMPANIES TO WRITE DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICIES I MENTION I HAD A MEETING LAST WEEK WITH A REALLY LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY. AND THE YOU KNOW I. PUSHED ON THEM THEY CAME BACK THEIR ENQUIRING I THINK THE MORE COMPANIES WE CAN GET TO WRITE THE DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION THE MORE COMPETITION THERE IS AND OF COURSE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE YOU KNOW I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET. AND PERHAPS QUESTION I CAN HAVE A AN OFFSET CONVERSATION AND DO EVEN MORE IN THAT IN THAT REGARD I THINK COMPETITION IS REALLY THE BEST THING FOR THESE CUSTOMERS. AND. I AGAIN I'M- THOSE ARE THOSE ARE BIG NUMBERS AND THE BIGGEST PART OF THE PREMIUM REALLY IN THEORY SHOULD BE ON THE FIRE SO. WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT IS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S MAKING A LOT OF MONEY ON THOSE POLICIES AYE BUT THERE'S ANOTHER COMPANY MAKING LASSEN PROBABLY CHARGING LAST SO. AGAIN I WOULD SAY COMPETITION IS PROBABLY THE BEST SOLUTION TO THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR- RESPONSES. AND HELPFUL INFORMATION LET'S GO AHEAD AND HEAR FROM MR CLOSED IN BROWN. SURPLUS LINES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA GO AHEAD SIR. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DAILY MY NAME IS CLIFTON BROWN AND I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE SURPLUS LINES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DAILY VICE CHAIR MAYES AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEF YOU TODAY REGARDING THE STATE OF THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET AND THE SURPLUS LINE INDUSTRY'S ROLE IN THAT MARKET. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME VERY BRIEF BACKGROUND ON WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO. THE SURPLUS LINES ASSOCIATION WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND IT WAS APPOINTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR IS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS SURPLUS LINE ADVISORY ORGANIZATION. IN THIS ROLE WE REVIEW EVERY SURPLUS LINE POLICY FILE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ALL PERTINENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED LICENSED BROKERS PLACE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND POLICIES WITH A TOTAL PREMIUM OF SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. HOMEOWNERS IS A VERY VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THIS MARKET. BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE UP FRONT BUT STATE LAW REQUIRES OUR MEMBERS TO PERFORM A DILIGENT SEARCH FOR AN ADMITTED CARRIER THAT WILL COVER A RISK BEFORE PLACING THAT POLICY IN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET. THE CODE CONSIDERS THREE DECLINATIONS FROM ADMITTED CARRIERS TO BE PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE BUT A DILIGENT SEARCH HAS TAKEN PLACE. IN SOME INSTANCES ADMITTED INSURERS WILL MAKE A BUSINESS DECISION NOT TO COVER A PARTICULAR RISK OR CLASS OF RISKS THESE ARE USUALLY IN CASE OF DISTRESSED NEW COMPLEX OR HIGH CAPACITY RISKS. IN THE HOMEOWNERS MARKET. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY AN ADMITTED CARRIER MAY REDUCES INSURED CONCENTRATION FOR INSTANCE IT MIGHT FIND THAT IT IS TOO CONCENTRATED IN A PARTICULAR AREA OR THE RISK PROFILE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED DUE TO FORCES BEYOND ITS CONTROL SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE. IN THESE CASES CONSUMERS NEED OPTIONS OR THEY WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT THE INSURANCE COVERAGE THEY NEED. THEY CAN PROCURE THAT COVERAGE EITHER THROUGH THE FAIR PLAN FOR THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF RISKS THAT GO INTO SURPLUS LINES ARE COMMERCIAL. VERY LITTLE PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS GOES INTO THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET. IN THE. BETWEEN ONE POINT 4% AND ONE POINT 8% OF ALL SURPLUS LINES PREMIUMS COLLECTED IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN INCREASES IN RECENT YEARS IN THE TOTAL PREMIUM AND NUMBER OF POLICIES AND THE SURPLUS LINES HOMEOWNERS MARKET AS ADMITTED CARRIERS HAVE PULLED BACK IN CERTAIN FIRE PRONE AREAS. HOWEVER. EVEN WITH THESE INCREASES HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE STILL ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN TWO POINT 5% OF THE ENTIRE SURPLUS LINES MARKET PLACE IN THE STATE AND BASED ON THE MOST RECENT FIGURES AVAILABLE ON THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS WEBSITE ONLY ABOUT ONE POINT 7% OF THE ENTIRE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE PREMIUM IN THE STATE WENT INTO SURPLUS LINES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALTHOUGH IT IS PROBABLE BASED ON THE GROWTH WE HAVE SEEN THAT THIS PERCENTAGE HAS SURPASSED ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE DATA ON THE VALUE OF HOMES INSURED IN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET PLACE. IT IS OUR SENSE THAT MOST OF THESE HOMES ARE HIGH END HOMES WITH OWNERS WHO NEED MORE COVERAGE THAN THE FAIR PLAN CAN PROVIDE. IN THESE CASES THE SURPLUS LINE INDUSTRY IS FILLING A ROLE THAT IS NO LONGER BEING SERVED BY THE ADMITTED MARKET WHICH IS EXACTLY THE ROLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ENVISIONS FOR OUR INDUSTRY. OUR PURPOSE IS NOT TO SUPPLANT THE ADMITTED MARKET. RATHER WE ARE HERE TO PROVIDE OPTIONS TO CONSUMERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE LEVEL OF INSURANCE THEY WANT. DURING A MARKET SEEING NOW. IN CLOSING THE SURPLUS LINES INTO THREE PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN ENSURING THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WHO CANNOT OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE. IN THE ADMITTED MARKET HAVE OPTIONS TO INSURE PROPERTY AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES. OUR MISSION IS TO ENSURE A RESPONSIVE AND LAWFUL SURPLUS LINE MARKET EXISTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT THIS TIME I'D BE GLAD TO TAKE pTHANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MISTER BROWN ABOUT SURPLUS LINES AND THE ROLE THEY PLAY. OKAY. EVEN ARE A OUR EVEN OUR RESIDENT INSURANCE AGENT TO. IS SATISFIED WITH THE DETAILS HERE ANY OTHER QUOTE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU IF I COULD PLEASE I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK ON A PARTICULAR SUBJECT THAT I MANAGE TO COMPLETELY GO PAST AND IT'S SOMETHING I BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT TO YOU AS WELL THE RIGHT OUT CREDITS FOR MEMBER COMPANIES SURE PLEASE I WOULD EXCUSE IF THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY PRESENTATION THAT IF WE NEED MONEY WHERE UNLIKE UNLIKE REGULAR INSURANCE COMPANIES OR BACK BY SEGA WE'RE BACK BY THE MARKET. AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT RIGHT NOW COMPANIES OUT THERE ARE VERY VERY CLOSELY WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FAIR PLAN BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE WE GOT THIRTY TWO MILLION I BELIEVE IN CAPITAL WHICH IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR SO WE ARE. AT RISK OF DOING AN ASSESSMENT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE MEMBER COMPANIES. THAT MEANS. THEY CARE A LOT ABOUT THEIR ASSESSMENT POTENTIAL. RIGHT THEY DON'T WANT THE FAIR PLAN TO GO OUT THERE AND SAY. HEY COUGH UP. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE WAY THAT STOOD UP AS IT'S DONE BY MARKET SHARE. SO IF A COMPANY RIGHTS STATE. FOR HOMEOWNERS. THAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO COUGH UP 10% OF WHATEVER THE ASSESSMENT AMOUNT IT IS. SO WHY ARE THE RIGHT OUT CREDIT SO IMPORTANT WELL TODAY. THE RIGHT UP CREDITS ARE LIMITED TO A VERY VERY SMALL AREA MOSTLY IN LA COUNTY. THE CURRENT DEFINITION IN THE INSURANCE CODE IS THE I SO BRUSH WILDFIRE AREAS WHICH IS AGAIN I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH TINY LITTLE AREAS. AND THAT HASN'T CHANGED IN DECADES THE DEFINITION OF THAT HAS NOT CHANGED IN DECADES. I BELIEVE CHAIRMAN DALY HAS HAS SOME LANGUAGE TO. INCREASE THAT. SO THAT COMPANIES WILL HAVE THE INCENTIVE. TO RIDE IN AREAS THAT ARE HIGH OR VERY HIGH. BRUSH WILDFIRE EXPOS PER CALIFORNIA NOW WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A ONE FOR ONE OFFSET IF A COMPANY RIGHTS A DOLLAR PREMIUM IN AN AREA THAT'S CONSIDERED A RIGHT OUT CREDIT AREA. THAT REDUCES THEIR MARKET SHARE BY THE SAME DOLLAR. SO WHAT IS THIS ACCOMPLISH WELL WHAT IT DOES IS IT PUTS A CHECK IN THE POSITIVE COLUMN FOR A COMPANY TO WRITE. A POLICY IN AN AREA THAT'S CONSIDERED HIGH IN VERY HIGH BECAUSE THEY GET THE OFFSET. ON THE BACKEND FOR POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT. SO IF A COMPANY LET'S SAY THEY HAVE A 10% MARKET SHARE IN THE STATE TODAY THEY WRITE 10% OF THE PREMIUMS AND HOMEOWNERS TODAY. IF THEY END UP WRITING A FULL 1% OF THE PREMIUMS IN THESE AREAS THEY CAN REDUCE THEIR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE BY A FULL PERCENT AND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG MONEY SO. THE REASON I'M SUPPORTING THE LANGUAGE THAT TERM DALY HOUSES BECAUSE- IT PROVIDES INCENTIVE. TO THE VOLUNTARY MARKET TO WRITE POLICIES IN THOSE AREAS AGAIN BECAUSE THEY WANT THAT OFFSET. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SON TODAY. AGAIN ALL WE'RE LOOKING TO DO ARE ALL ALL I'M SUPPORTING IS AN IS AN EXPANSION OF THE AREAS FOR WHICH COMPANIES CAN GET CREDITS. BECAUSE BEING ON THE RECEIVING END OF A YOU KNOW DOING THE MATH ON A ON AN ANNUAL BASIS COMPANIES CARE A LOT ABOUT THIS. AND THEY WILL CARE EVEN MORE IF THEY HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO GET RIGHT OUT CREDIT SO I WANTED TO JUST I MANAGE TO COMPLETELY SKIP THAT BUT I JUST WANTED TO SUPPORT. OF THE LANGUAGE THAT CHAIRMAN DALY HAS GOING THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE I BELIEVE. AGAIN IT'LL PUT A CHECK IN THE POSITIVE COLUMN FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO WANT TO WRITE IN THESE AREAS GOOD. THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH ABSOLUTELY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL WE HAVE THREE. THREE MORE PANEL SIR TO HEAR FROM SO WITH THAT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR TIME. AND VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION THIS MORNING THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE NEXT PANEL IS SO A PANEL OF ONE. MR JOLE OUT YOUR SPECIAL CONSULTANT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. SH SURE I THINK WE CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW WELL MISTER LECTURES FINDING HIS SEAT. WILL ADD ON TO THAT BILL. AB TWO NINETY FIVE MAYES HI MAYES AYE BERMAN BERMAN I TO. FRAZIER GIPSON. MARGARITA HI KAMLAGER-DOVE HI. ELEVEN TWO ZERO THANKS MISTER BERMAN FOR OF THE REMINDER APPRECIATED THANK YOU. SO GO AHEAD SIR FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF MISTER RICARDO LARA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SITE THANK YOU FOR INVITING US HERE TO SPEAK TODAY ON MY NAME'S JOEL LAUTERER I AM A SENIOR ADVISER AT THE DEPARTMENT. I WAS ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE. ON THE DEPARTMENTS RECENT RELEASE OF DATA. THAT THAT SHOWS THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES ON INSURANCE NON RENEWALS AND AVAILABILITY IN THE STATE AS WELL AS COMMENT ON CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. NEW DATA COLLECTED BY THE DEPARTMENT FROM INSURERS AND RELEASED JUST YESTERDAY SHOWS INSURANCE IS BECOMING HARDER TO FIND TO FIND FOR THOSE IN HIGH A WILDFIRE RISK AREAS. PRESUMABLY BASED ON UNDERWRITING DECISIONS MADE IN CONSIDERATION OF RECENT WILDFIRES. THE DATA REVEALS THERE WAS A 6% INCREASE IN IN SURE INITIATED HOMEOWNER POLICY NON RENEWALS. IN THE CAL FIRE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WELL ZIP CODES AFFECTED BY THE DEVASTATING FIRES FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SET TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EXPERIENCED A 10% INCREASE IN IN SURE INITIATED NON RENEWALS. THIS STATE ALSO REVEALED THE AVAILABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE DROPPED IN HIGH RISK COUNTIES. AND THOSE ARE ALL OVER THE STATE TO WOLLEMI TRINITY NEVADA AND MARIPOSA WHO MUST ALPINE CALAVERAS SIERRA AMADOR AN ELDORADO COUNTIES. FROM. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NUMBER OF NEW AND RENEWED POLICIES HOMEOWNERS POLICIES FELL BY EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED IN THE TEN COUNTIES WITH THE MOST HOMES IN VERY HIGHER VERY HIGH. FIRE RISK AREAS SO THE NUMBERS OF NOT HAVE NON RENEWALS AND ARE OF NEW AND NEW BUSINESS GOING DOWN DESPITE DEVELOPMENT IN THOSE COUNTIES. AT A TIME WHEN THE OVERALL FAIR PLAN POLICY NUMBERS HAVE BEEN DECREASING FAIR PLAN NUMBERS IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS HAVE INCREASED ANALYSTS POINTED THAT OUT. FROM ABOUT THIRTY NINE THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND FOR TWO FORTY NINE THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE 25% INCREASE. THESE NEW POLICIES AGAIN ARE ALSO COMING FROM ACROSS THE STATE. AMADOR BUTTE CALAVERAS EL DORADO KERN AND LAKE LASSEN MADERA MARIPOSA MEN TO SEE NO NO NO MONTEREY NEVADA ORANGE PLASTER PLUMAS RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARDINO SAN DIEGO SAN LUIS OBISPO SANTA CRUZ SHASTA SISKIYOU CINEMA STANISLAUS TRINITY TULARE WOLLEMI IN TORA ALL SAW SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF NEW POLICIES IN THE FAIR PLAN. EARLIER THIS YEAR COMMISSIONER LARA APPROACH THE FAIR PLAN ASKING THEM TO CONSIDER INCREASING THEIR COVERAGE LIMITS FROM ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO THREE MILLION. YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT FROM THIS JOHN AS WELL. THEY VOTED FOR THAT THREE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. WE WOULD WISH THAT THAT LIMIT WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE SOONER AND I UNDERSTAND THE- THAT SHE PRESENTED REASONS WHY IT CAN'T. BUT WE'RE STILL HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN MOVE UP THAT APRIL DATE. SHE ALSO DISCUSS AN ISSUE THAT THE CONCERN LARA HAS ALSO DRESSED WITH THE FAIR PLAN COMMISSIONER LARA REQUESTED THAT THE FAIR PLAN ADD. A LIABILITY WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE OR OFFER AN HOMEOWNERS AGE OF THREE POLICY DIRECTLY. A BETTER COVERAGE PACKAGE IS LONG OVERDUE FOR URBAN POLICY HOLDERS WHO STILL COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF FAIR PLAN BUSINESS. AND IT IS CRITICAL AS MORE CALIFORNIANS FROM RURAL COUNTIES ARE HAVING TO TURN TO THE FAIR PLAN FOR COVERAGE. I UNDERSTAND THE REASONS THAT WERE PROVIDED BY WHY THAT MIGHT NOT BE A GREAT IDEA FOR THE FAIR PLAN. BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT PURCHASING SEPARATE POLICIES. EACH ONE WILL HAVE A SEPARATE EXPENSE LOAD A SEPARATE COMMISSION. AND ALL OF THAT COMBINED WITH WITH WHAT IS A VERY EXPENSIVE FIRE POLICY. MAKES IT A VERY EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION TO PUT TOGETHER A FULL COVERAGE PACKAGE FOR THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL EITHER IN THE FAIR PLANS URBAN BOOK WHICH IS LARGELY AS MENTIONED IN. EAST LA. FOR RICHMOND OAKLAND OR FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE RURAL AREAS THAT ARE HAVING YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE MOVING THE FAIR PLAN. SO IT WOULD BE SO EXPENSIVE TO PUT TOGETHER TO IN THREE POLICIES TO ACCOMPLISH. WHAT AN AGE OF THREE PROVIDES. DATA SHOWS THERE'S ALSO BEEN A 49% INCREASE IN SURPLUS LINES POLICIES IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. IN THOSE FOUR YEARS SURPLUS LINES WRITINGS HAVE INCREASED FROM FIVE BY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND POLICIES FOR THOSE IN A STATE RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S A 50% INCREASE IN SURPLUS LINES WRITINGS IN THAT AREA. THE GROWTH IN THESE ALTERNATIVE MARKETS THE FAIR PLAN AND STE AND THE SURPLUS LINES REFLECTS THE TREND IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET WERE NON RENEWALS IN AREAS OF HIGH FIRE RISK ARE ON THE INCREASE. AND I WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS NEW DATA THE DATA THE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT DOES NOT MEASURE THE FULL IMPACT OF NON RENEWALS FROM THE. HOMEOWNERS POLICIES LINKED TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES WHICH ACTUALLY HAS A INSURERS RETRENCHING FURTHER IS WHAT WE BELIEVE AS FIRES OF THE CAMP CAR BALLSY HILL FIRES. SINCE CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES INSURERS GIVE A FORTY FIVE DAY NOTICE BEFORE A NON RENEWABLE AND THESE WILDFIRES OCCURRED NEAR THE END OF THE YEAR THE FULL EFFECTS OF THOSE FIRES ON UNDERWRITING DECISIONS. PROBABLY AREN'T IN THE DATE. THIS EXPECTATION IS CONSISTENT WITH CONVERSATIONS THAT COMMISSIONER LARA HAS HAD WITH HOMEOWNERS LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEADERS AND CONSUMER GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE. THE PROBLEM OF INSURANCE. NON RENEWAL IS GENERALLY EXPECTED TO GET WORSE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND BEYOND AS INSURERS UNDERWRITING DECISIONS MADE AFTER TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES TAKE FULL EFFECT. IN FACT A FEW INSURERS ALREADY HAVE INFORMED THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY PLAN TO NON RENEW THOUSANDS OF HOMEOWNERS POLICIES ACROSS THE STATE IN GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS BOTH RURAL AND URBAN TO WHAT FIRE RISK SAID THERE ARE MORE NON RENEWALS AHEAD. NOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE STATE WITH OVER EIGHT MILLION INSERTED RESIDENCES THESE NUMBERS MAY SEEM EVENTS AND SIGNIFICANT. BUT AGAIN I HOPE EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES TO THE INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES WHERE THE NON RENEWALS ARE TAKING PLACE. IT CREATES BOTH PERSONAL AND REGIONAL CRISES AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PROPERTY VALUES AND THOSE COMMUNITIES CAN BE TROUBLING. AND JUST SO IT'S JUST NOT MY WORDS THE DEPARTMENT COMMISSIONER LARA'S HOLDING AT TOWN HALL IN NEVADA COUNTY TOMORROW EVENING. AND WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED OF MANY INCREASED AND QUESTIONS AND COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS IN THOSE AREAS I'M JUST GOING TO READ A COUPLE OF THEM TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOR OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO HEAR. DOES FROM AN INDIVIDUAL ELLISON NEVADA COUNTY HAVE RECEIVED A NON RENEWAL FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW. NOW I AM UNABLE TO GET INSURANCE FROM ANY KERRIER. IF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROPERTY VALUES WILL DROP TAXES WILL GO DOWN AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE PROPERTY TAXES WILL BE IN TROUBLE. IF YOU ARE A NEIGHBOR OF. EMPIRE MINE STATE PARK AND THEY ARE NOT REDUCING FUEL LOADS ON YOUR SHARED BOUNDARY WHAT CAN A HOMEOWNER DO. THE WE WORK OUR LAND AND TRIM THE TREES WE STILL GET DROPPED TWICE NOW THE SAME AS PEOPLE WHO DO NOTHING. WE LIVE IN FOREST IN CALIFORNIA OUR INSURANCE COMPANY DROP THIS ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. WE WERE ABLE TO GET NEW INSURANCE THE COST US SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS LAST YEAR. IT WENT UP TO OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. AND ONE MORE. SO THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS RIGHT THESE IF YOU GO OUT IN THE COMMUNITIES THIS IS WHAT YOU HEAR. NOW THIS JUST SEEM LIKE BIG NUMBERS BUT WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO INDIVIDUAL AREAS IT'S THERE'S A CONCENTRATION OF PEOPLE IN THIS SITUATION. MAKING THEIR INSURANCE ON AFFORDABLE THEIR HOME ON AFFORDABLE. THEIR HOME AND SELLABLE. BUT NON RENEWALS ARE ONLY A PART OF THE STORY. INSERTS FILINGS FOR PREMIUM HIKES ARE COMING IN RECORD NUMBERS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE. OF FILINGS FOR RATE INCREASES FOR HOMEOWNERS POLICIES TWENTY FIVE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT WAS THIRTY FOUR. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT WAS FIFTY. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT WAS SIXTY NINE. AND JUST THROUGH JULY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WERE ALREADY AT SIXTY THREE. WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT MANY IN SIR GROUPS WRITING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA SO WHAT THAT TELLS YOU IS THE SAME INSERTS ARE COMING IN FOR MULTIPLE RATE INCREASES SO WITH LAYERING ONE ON TOP OF THE NEXT. IN THE BOOK OF EACH OF THOSE RATE INCREASES CAN FALL HEAVILY ON A SMALL SUBSET OF THAT INSURERS RISK POPULATION. SAN FELIPE DOES NOT HI WELL FIRE AREAS. SO WHILE YOU LOOK AT A RATE OF RATE FILING LOG IT SAYS THAT COMPANIES ARE COMING IN FOR A 7% INCREASE. THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF AN AVERAGE ACROSS THE WHOLE BOOK OF BUSINESS. OFTENTIMES WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS PEOPLE IN THE URBAN AREA ARE GETTING NO INCREASE. AND THE PEOPLE IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL SEGMENT OF THE BOOK. ARE GETTING DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES MASSIVE INCREASES 50% AND MORE FREQUENTLY. AND WE UNDERSTAND THE SERVICE ARE REACTING TO POSSIBLY THE WORST CALIFORNIA HOMERS LOSS RATIOS OF ALL TIME. TWO HUNDRED AND 1% IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A HUNDRED AND 70% IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THUS FAR THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN APPROVING MUCH GREATER THAN 90% OF THE REQUESTED INCREASES. AS INSURERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE REQUEST HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY SOUND. WITH THESE INCREASES INSERTS WILL TAKE IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL DOLLARS EACH YEAR IN THE YEARS AHEAD IN ANTICIPATION OF FUTURE WILDFIRES. BUT COMMISSIONER LARA AND THE DEPARTMENT ASKS WHAT ABOUT THE HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE LIVED IN THESE. COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES. COVERAGE THAT WAS READILY AVAILABLE FOR MANY YEARS AND PREMIUMS THAT WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY OUT OF LINE. URBAN PRICES HAVE NOW FLIPPED ON THEM. THEIR SITUATION TURNED UPSIDE DOWN IN JUST A VERY FEW YEARS AND THEY NEED HELP. SO MR Là ALARA ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT THESE ISSUES NEED MASSIVE ACTION AT MANY LEVELS TO MITIGATE THE ISSUES AND PREPARE FOR CLIMATE RISK AND A GROWING STATE POPULATION. MUCH OF THIS IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY OR ITS REGULATOR TO RESOLVE HELLO. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THE COMMISSIONER BELIEVES CAN BE DONE TO HELP THOSE POLICY HOLDERS WHO ARE IN CRISIS. AND HELP THOSE WHO SUFFER LOSSES FROM FUTURE WILDFIRES WE NEED TO ANTICIPATE. THESE ARE PROPOSALS THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SHOULD DO AND THAT WILL HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT ON COSTS OR LOSSES GIVEN THE SCOPE OF THE CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE. ONE EXAMPLE A VERY IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT WOULD ASSIST HOMEOWNERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WOULD TO GIVE THEM A MUCH EARLIER NOTICE OF NON RENEWAL OF THEIR INSURANCE POLICIES. PEOPLE NEED TIME TO MITIGATE THEIR PROPERTY OR PICK TO POSSIBLY PRESERVE THEIR RENEWAL. FOR HOMEOWNERS THIS CAN MEAN TIME TO DO A MAJOR PROJECT TO THEMSELVES OR TO HIRE SOMEONE TO DO WHAT CAN BE DIFFICULT. BUT IMPORTANT PROJECT SUCH AS REMOVE TREES ARE BRUSH THE NEXT AND THE NEXT STRUCTURAL REPAIRS. IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO MOVE PROPANE TANKS AWAY FROM THE HOME OR REPLACE A DECK WITH NON COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS OR IN CLOSE VINCE. OLDER INDIVIDUALS IN PARTICULAR MAY NEED TIME TO SEEK ASSISTANCE. SOME POLICIES HOLDERS MAY NEED TIME TO OBTAIN LOANS OR GRANTS OR OTHER ASSISTANCE WITH COSTS. A HUNDRED EIGHT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS A NON RENEWAL NOTICE. WOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TIME TO TAKE THESE ACTIONS FOR PEOPLE AND THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND ELSEWHERE. OR AT LEAST IT WOULD ALLOW TIME FOR SCARING THE MARKET FOR THAT POSSIBLY VERY ELUSIVE IT RENEWAL COVERAGE WITH AN ENTITY OTHER THAN THE FAIR PLAN. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR MUCH LONGER NOTICE. HOMEOWNERS AND LOCAL LEADERS ALSO HAVE A GREAT DESIRE TO HAVE A MEANS OF ACHIEVING SOME CERTAINTY THAT THERE IS AN AVENUE. NO MATTER HOW NARROW THAT IF NAPA NAVIGATED WOULD ALLOW A HOMEOWNER TO RETAIN THEIR COVERAGE. THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED BY CREATING A REQUIREMENT THAT INSURERS WILL OFFER COVERAGE TO HOMEOWNERS WHO MEET COMPREHENSIVE AND EFFECTIVE HOME HARDENING CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS. THIS REQUIREMENT COULD ALLOW FOR EXCEPTIONS FOR OTHER CONSIDERATIONS OF RISK AND BE FLEXIBLE TO ACCOUNT FOR AN ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IT WOULD TAKE TIME FOR THIS MITIGATED POPULATION OF WRIST TO GROW. BUT OVER TIME THESE HOMES WITHOUT A NOT ONLY BE REDUCING THEIR OWN RISK OF LOS. BUT DECREASING AMBER FLOW IN THE CASE OF A WILDFIRE TO HELP PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITY. SIGNAL EMITS SHOULD BE INCREASED TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A POLICY HOLDER LEFT WITHOUT COMPENSATION IF THERE ENSURE SOLVE SUFFERS ON INSOLVENCY. ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSE COVERAGE SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO DON'T SUFFER A DIRECT LOSS TO THEIR PROPERTY. BUT WHOSE HOMES BECOME UNINHABITABLE FOR A TIME UNTIL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS REPAIRED. AND I HOPE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN PARADISE ELECTRIC LINES DOWN WATER SYSTEM DOWN. NO SEWAGE SYSTEM. PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES WERE STILL STANDING COULD NOT LIVE IN THOSE HOMES. IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO MANY POLICY HOLDERS IF THE LAW WAS ENACTED TO PROHIBIT THE REDUCTION IN THE REPLACEMENT COST PAY TO A CLAIMANT RESULTING FROM THE DEDUCTION OF THE LAND VALUE. WHEN THE INSERT WHO HAS SUFFERED A TOTAL LOSS OF THE DWELLING CHOOSES TO RE LOCATE AND PURCHASE A HOME AT ANOTHER LOCATION. THIS WOULD BE A PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO BOTH SENIOR CITIZENS. AND FAMILIES WHO CAN'T GO THROUGH THE ORDEAL AND TIME OF REBUILDING. MR LARA HAS SPECIFICALLY APPROACH THE INDUSTRY TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THIS MARK. SEC YOUR LANGUAGE ON THE. NOVEL I THINK WE CAN GET YOU LANGUAGE CERTAINLY. END OF GREAT FINANCIAL. THE EMOTIONAL BENEFIT CONSUMERS WHO HAVE SUFFERED A TOTAL LOSS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THEIR CONTENTS CLAIMS. WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE GRUELING AND UNDERSTANDABLY HEART RENDING PROCESS OF THE HOMEOWNER HAVING TO IDENTIFY EVERY ITEM HE OR SHE OWNED. IT'S PURCHASE PRICE DATE OF PURCHASE COST AND CONDITION JUST THE KEPT THE ACTUAL CASH VALUE THAT'S THE DEPRECIATED VALUE. THEN HAVING TO SUBMIT REPEATS WANTS THE RECEIPTS GIVES ME WHAT'S THE ITEM IS REPLACED TO RECEIVE THE REPLACEMENT COST. WOULD LIKE SOME WAIVER OF THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE CONTENTS INVENTORY. FINALLY NOBODY THINKS THEY ARE UNDERINSURED FOR THE REBUILD OF THEIR HOME. THAT IS DUE IN LARGE PART BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COST TO BUILD A HOME. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF HOMEOWNERS RELY ON THE ESTIMATE EVERY LOOK PLACEMENT COST PROVIDED BY THE AND FOR. BUT MANY POLICIES HAVE NEVER RECEIVED AN ESTIMATE BECAUSE. INSURERS ARE ABSOLUTELY OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE ONE ESPECIALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THAT SITUATION WOULD BE IMPROVED IF THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY INSURED GETS A ROUTINE ESTIMATE OF REPLACEMENT COST AT REGULAR INTERVALS. FAMILIES WHO SUFFER A TOTAL LOSS AND WHO ARE UNDER. UNDER INSURED PRESENT SOME OF THE SADDEST SITUATIONS THAT WE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MAINTENANCE FOR UNITED POLICY HOLDERS AS WELL THAT WE DEAL WITH AFTER A LOSS. AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO READ A COUPLE COMMENTS FROM CONSUMERS VERY BRIEFLY. THESE ARE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD LOSSES IN CINEMA. STRUCTURAL REIMBURSEMENT WAS NOT ADEQUATE TO REBUILD THE HOUSE. WE WERE LED TO BELIEVE WHEN WE PURCHASED AND REVIEWED OUR POLICY PERIODICALLY THAT WE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH COVERAGE TO REBUILD OUR HOUSE AS IT WHAT'S- WE WERE TOLD WE PAID FOR ADDITIONAL COVERAGE. TO BE CONFIDENT THAT WOULD WE WOULD BE REIMBURSED AT THE RATE OF BUILDING COST WHEN A DISASTER OCCURRED. ANOTHER COMMENT. POLICY LIMITS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE FOR REBUILDING. APPEALED MADE AND DENIED BECAUSE THE COMPANY. FALLS BACK ON CALIFORNIA LOSSING HOMEOWNERS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING UP POLICY LIMITS REGARDLESS OF GOAL STATED TO AGENT NO JUST READ ONE MORE. MY HOME WAS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET WITH A THREE CAR GARAGE THE SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FEET THIRTY ONE HUNDRED TOTAL. THE ABSOLUTE CHEAPEST BETTER WAS A PARTICULAR CONTRACTOR AT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REBUILD THE HOME. WE WERE IN SHORT FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT BUILDER WENT OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THEIR BIDS WERE TOO LOW SAID THE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT. WOULD NOT A COVERED. SO THAT'S HOW UNDER INSURED THEY WERE BY ABOUT. WE NEED ABOUT DOUBLE THE LIMITS THEY WERE AT. NO MENTION I BELIEVE UNDER INSURANCE IS SOMETHING TOTALLY WITHIN THE INSURERS ABILITY TO RESOLVE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T ALLOW TO OCCUR IN OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS. IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS AND YOU WANT TO SAY I NEED WORKERS COMP COVERAGE BUT I I'M GONNA PUT MY PAYROLL AT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE ANSWER WILL SAY WE NEED TO VERIFY WHAT YOUR PAYROLL IS I SEE YOU HAVE FIVE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. WE THINK YOUR PREMIUM YOUR PAYROLL SHOULD BE MORE LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEY DON'T LET YOU COME UP WITH THE NUMBER THEY DON'T LET YOU SET A SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR YOUR MERCANTIL BUSINESS AND JUST LET I'D LIKE TO AND FOR FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. THEY'RE GOING TO MEASURE IT. THEY WANT EVERYBODY TO PUT PAY A FAIR PREMIUM. SAME SHOULD BE TRUE FOR HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE. SO. I WOULD BUY ONE THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR Là CHAIR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION VERY HELPFUL. IN OTHER ANY QUESTIONS FOR MISTER LARGER BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE NEXT PANEL. IF NOT THE THANK YOU AGAIN SIR VERY HELPFUL AND LIKE IT WILL BE WILL BE IN DISCUSSION WITH THE YOUR APARTMENT ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES. ONE OF POINT OUT THE TO. THE BILL THAT I'M CARRYING. DOES ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES THAT MR LECTURE MENTIONED I'LL BE PRESENTING THAT BILL THIS AFTERNOON IN THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE SO THERE ARE A- I THINK IN THE- SPIRIT OF A PROBLEM SOLVING WERE MAKING SOME GOOD SOME GOOD PROGRESS. ALL RIGHT THE NEXT PANEL IS SO CONSUMER PERSPECTIVES WE HAVE RANDY FLETCHER WHO IS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FROM YUBA COUNTY NEARBY. AND AMY BACH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNITED POLICY HOLDERS. AMY WANT YOU WANT YOU GO AHEAD AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM. AT THE SUPERVISOR. OKAY THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING IT'S AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO BE HERE IN THE SEARCH FOR CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE SITUATION IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES IN A VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION ABOUT MYSELF AND UNITED POLICY HOLDERS. AND THE VERY LONG RANGE PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE ON THE AND- WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONTINUE CALLING A CRUNCH BUT WHICH IS INCREASINGLY FEELING LIKE A CRISIS OF THE AVAILABILITY IN HOMEOWNER AND AFFORDABILITY OF HOME INSURANCE IN OUR STATE. I'M OUR ORGANIZATION WAS FOUNDED AROUND THE TIME OF THE OAKLAND BERKELEY FIRE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WE'RE FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE WE HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN INSURANCE AND IN DISASTER RECOVERY AND THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED OVER. THE LAST TWENTY EIGHT YEARS PRIMARILY WORKING IN THE AFTERMATH OF WILDFIRES AND I I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF YOU THAT ARE HERE AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE AT A FORUM THIS WEEKEND THAT. ASSEMBLYMAN CHU IS HOSTING TO EDUCATE HIS CONSTITUENTS ON PROTECTING THEIR ASSETS AND I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INSURANCE IS A VERY VALUABLE SYSTEM THAT WE WANT TO WORK WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO NEED WE WANT PEOPLE TO PROTECT THEIR ASSETS WE ALSO WANT THEM TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR MORTGAGES. SO WHO IS TO REASONS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A MARKET WHERE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD REASONABLY ADEQUATE COVERAGE ON THEIR HOME AND THAT HAS AS YOU'VE ALL BEEN HEARING. BECOME A LOT MORE CHALLENGING IN RECENT YEARS OUR ORGANIZATION RUNS TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE GERMANE ONE THE ROAD MAP TO PREPAREDNESS THE OTHER THE ROADMAP TO RECOVERY AND THROUGH THOSE PROGRAMS A RIGHT NOW MY TEAM HAS BANNED IS IN. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER'S OFF A DISTRICT. WE HAVE BEEN DOING WORKSHOPS THERE SINCE. THE FIRES WE ARE ALSO HAVING WORKSHOPS IN THOUSAND OAKS AND I ALSO HAVE BEEN. WORKING IN THAT SNOW MAP AREA AND SO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH ALL THESE ISSUES THAT YOU JUST HEARD JOEL OUT YOUR TALK ABOUT ON WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE'S INSURANCE IS AN ADEQUATE. THAT HAD BEEN OUR FOCUS BECAUSE TWO THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE WE WORK WITH TURNED OUT TO NOT HAVE ENOUGH INSURANCE SO YOU KNOW THIS SATURDAY AT ASSEMBLYMAN SHOES EVENT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT OF COURSE. WE'RE HERE REALLY TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S GOT A JUMPED INTO THE HEADLINES WHERE OKAY YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING ANY INSURANCE AT ALL LET ALONE A NOT. SO IT'S A MATTER OF DEGREE AND I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A PRODUCER HERE AND I WANTED. THE COMMITTEE TO KNOW THAT IN PREPARATION FOR TODAY I CHECKED IN WITH A NUMBER OF OUR PRODUCER VISORS I HAVE AGENTS AND BOTH DIRECT CAPTIVE IN. INDEPENDENCE THAT I CHECKED WITH HOW ARE YOU DOING IN GETTING YOUR CLIENT PLACED AND MY CONCERN LEVEL IS ELEVATED QUITE A BIT IN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS JUST TALKING. TO SOME OF THE PRODUCERS WHO HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN. ABLE TO PUT THEIR CLIENTS WITH SURPLUS LINES AND NOT THE NAME BRANDS. IT'S NOT EVEN ON THE TABLE ALL FOR A LOT OF THEM YOU KNOW CHILD PURER A IG THE STATE BUYS THAT HAD TRADITIONALLY BEEN WINTER. THE HIGHER AND HOME EVEN THEN ARE THE EVEN THERE ARE THESE PRODUCERS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME AND THEY'RE OUT. WHEN YOU GO TO THE FAIR PLAN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THEY KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE FIT AND SO. THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO KNOW WE DON'T HAVE INFINITE AMOUNT OF TIME I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE MOST SORT OF HIGH LEVEL. THIS IS AN END OF AND YOU KNOW THE REPRESENTATIVE IT'S HERE WITH ME. SURE YEAH WE HAD A CRASH COURSE IN ASSURANCE AND UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY IN THIS ON THIS ISSUE. FOR LAST YEAR BECAUSE IT. AS TO TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS THAT ARE SCARING THE CRAP OUT OF THEM. OF ABOUT THE RISKS THAT THEY FACE IN THE STATE. BUT I DO WANT YOU TO REMEMBER AT OF EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING AT YOU WHAT JOEL SAID. ABOUT THE RATE INCREASES THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED AND THE MONEY THAT IS GOING TO BE COMING INTO THE COFFERS OF THE INSURERS AND JUST REMEMBER THAT THAT IS A- A SOURCE OF SOME OPTIMISM HERE AND THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM. THAT NEEDS TO BE HANDLED VERY THOUGHTFUL. BECAUSE THIS IS A MARKET THAT REQUIRES BALANCE STRAIGHT SO WE DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR WITH MANDATES THAT THAT MAKE A PROBLEM WORSE WE WANT TO FIND. THE I THINK A LOT OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED HERE ARE GOING TO BE SMALL STEPS SUCH AS THE RIGHT OUT CREDIT ISSUE THAT AT LEAST TALKING ABOUT. SUCH AS SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT JOLT CALLED OUT GIVING PEOPLE MORE TIME TO SHOP. BUT THE THINGS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU. OUR ORGANIZATION IS VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND SO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE QUOTES JOEL READ YOU. THOSE ARE PEOPLE WE HEAR FROM THEM ALL THE TIME AND I HAD BEEN COMING UP HERE FOR MEETINGS OF THE STREAM MORTALITY TASK FORCE AND INTO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS BECAUSE- I SAW THIS COMING. WEEK WE A LOT OF US SAW THIS COMING AND THEN THE WILD FIRES JUST MADE EVERYTHING A LOT WORSE. SO THAT. WE HAVE A SURVEY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AND THE- THAT WE DO SURVEYS THAT'S A BIG PART OF OUR WORK AND THE FIGURE OF TWO THIRDS OF DISASTER SURVIVORS BEING UNDERINSURED COMES. LARGELY FROM OUR SURVEYS AND IT'S BEEN A CONSISTENT SURVEY BUT I WANT TO PUT THAT ASIDE FROM IT WE HAVE A SURVEY GOING ON OUR HOME PAGE. ON FOR DON RENEWALS BECAUSE YEAH WE HAD WERE WERE SORT OF PART OF OUR JOB IS TO BE A FULL TIME NAG AND WORRY WART. SO WE HAD BEEN SAYING TO THE DEPARTMENT GOSH YOU KNOW. SURPLUS LINES COMPANIES ARE PICKING UP A LOT OF THE RISKS THAT THE NAME BRAND CARRIERS HAD BEEN COVERING BUT THEY'RE NOT COVERED BY SIGA. SO YEAH WE HAD ONE COMPANY GO UNDER MERCED FROM THE CAMPFIRE THAT'S- YOU KNOW NOT GOOD BUT GREAT THAT IT WAS ONLY ONE WE DON'T WANT TO BE. WE DON'T WANT THAT NUMBER TO GROW AFTER THE NEXT RIGHT EVENTS WE WANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON. HOW MANY POLICIES ARE GOING INTO THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET GIVEN THAT. SURPLUS LINES POLICIES ARE NOT BACKED BY THE STATE INSOLVENCY POINT SO THAT ISSOMETHING I DO THINK YOU'RE- YOU GUYS REALLY WANT TO DO SOME THINKING IT OUT. AND BECAUSE I. AM AN OFFICIAL CONSUMER RAP AT TO THE NATIONAL. ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OVER MANY YEARS SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE- STATE WHEN THEY HAD. SIMILAR A SIMILAR CRISIS WHERE ARE A LOT OF THE IN RANCHERS WENT AWAY DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT RIGHT. INSURANCE IN. FLORIDA AND THEN THE STATE. PRETTY WELL INTO A- EQUIVALENT OF THE FAIR PLAN SUDDENLY THERE FAIR PLAN WAS WHERE ALL THE WOOD. THEY HAD THE MUCH THE BY FAR LARGEST MARKET SHARE IN THE STATE. THE THERE WAS AND OBVIOUSLY Và SIMILAR CHALLENGES TO WHAT AT LEAST LAID OUT. THEY DO THEY'RE NOT THEY WERE BUILT. TO CARRY THAT MUCH WEIGHT. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF I MEAN AT LEAST PUT IN HER REMARKS THEY HAVE SIXTY PEOPLE ON THEIR TEAM I MEAN THESE SORT OF NOT SIMPLE THINGS MATTER. AND SO BUT WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN IN FLORIDA WAS THE STATE HAD TO DO THEY DID A SORT OF A BY BY A INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHERE THEY ACTUALLY. INCENTIVIZED FINANCIALLY. THE NEW ENTRANTS TO COME IN AND TAKE UP RISKS I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO GO THAT WAY BUT I DO KNOW. THAT WE DON'T NEED TO START FROM SCRATCH HERE WE CAN BE LOOKING AT SOME OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TRIED. I AM I YOU KNOW I AM VERY MINDFUL. OF CRITICISMS THAT GET LEVELED AGAINST THE FAIR PLAN BY CONSUMERS BARTON JUST BECAUSE- BECAUSE WE WORK IN WILD FIRE AREAS WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN REPEAT FIRES WHERE. THERE'S A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE FAIR PLAN. AND WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE AND I THINK YOU KNOW TO BECAUSE THE COVERAGE IS LIMITED AND BUT YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW IT. FROM THE PRICING BECAUSE THE PRICING WOULD MAKE YOU THINK. THAT IT'S PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAN YOU WERE PAYING YOU KNOW FOR YOUR OLD INSURANCE. SO OUR ORGANIZATION IS ALWAYS LOOKING TO GIVE PEOPLE. NEWS THEY CAN USE IN THE HERE AND NOW WHAT CAN YOU DO IN THIS SITUATION. WHILE WE ALSO GET TO ENGAGE AT THE POLICY LEVEL WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU. SO WE HAVE A PUBLICATION DROP BY YOUR INSURER IN CALIFORNIA WHAT TO DO. AND THIS IS A DOUBLE SIDED SIMPLE DOCUMENT THAT I WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO ANY OF YOU TO SHARE WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS. I'M NUMBER ONE TRYING GET YOUR INSURER TO CHANGE COURSE AND AGREED TO RENEW YOU. WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT THEY HELP. YOU BUT HERE AGAIN THIS CUT FALLS BACK IN YOUR LAP. WE DON'T HAVE MITIGATION STANDARDS FOR WHILE BUYER REDUCTION THE STATE. THE INSURERS HAVE BEEN VERY VERY. RELUCTANT TO VOLUNTARILY AGREE THEY YOU KNOW I'VE LEARNED NOT TO USE THE WORD DISCOUNT. WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW WILL IF SOMEBODY DOES. DO WE WHACK AND CLEAR BRUSH BILLION TO REWARD THEM OR ARE THEY CAN JUST HAVE WASTE OF THEIR TIME AND MONEY AND NOW BE EVEN MORE. ANGRY AND I THINK INSURERS ARE GOING TO REALLY HAVE TO COME FORWARD I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM COME FORWARD WITH THEIR IDEA BECAUSE- THERE'S BEEN GENERALLY A SENSE OF. WHY CAN'T WE DO DISCOUNTS CAN'T POLICE IF THEY CONTINUE TO BRIGHT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. RIGHT BUT WE DON'T HAVE. A RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW WHEN WE SAGE TO GET YOUR INSURANCE CHANGED COURSE IN. THAT HAD BEEN GOOD ADVICE OF PEOPLE WERE WORKING WITH A GOOD AGENT OR BROKER THAT THAT KNEW HOW TO FIND THE COMPANY THAT WOULD WRITE BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE GETTING EVEN HARDER. SO NOW I THINK WE DO HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE TIME I THINK GIVING THEM INSTEAD OF FORTY FIVE DAYS NOTICE. GIVING HIM A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. ELTON AND I THINK YOU KNOW GENERALLY THE CARRIERS NO. YOU KNOW HALFWAY INTO THE POLICY YEAR WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO RENEW THAT POLICY OR NOT AND I THINK SO SOMETHING MORE THAN FORTY FIVE IS DEFINITELY CALLED FOR. I THINK WE DO HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE AND EDUCATION OF AGENTS ABOUT THE FAIR PLAN YOU KNOW ONE OF THE AGENTS I TALK TO YEP. YESTERDAY SAID WELL OF COURSE YOU CAN'T GET A LEAD YOU CAN GET TEMPORARY RANK COVERAGE THE FAIR PLAN. I CAN'T I FEEL SO I DON'T WANT TO PUT ANY OF MY CLIENTS IN THAT BECAUSE- THEY COULD LOSE THEIR HOME IF THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR MORTGAGE. SO IT TURNS OUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT ACCURATE YOU CAN GET. SOME A. ELLIE COVERAGE OF THE FAIR PLAN SO ALWAYS WITH THESE THESE WHAT WE CALL RESIDUAL MARKET PROGRAMS LIKE THE FLOOD. POLICIES OR THE CIA A LOT OF AGENTS. REALLY THE BETTER AGENTS DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUTTHESE PLANS BECAUSE THE COMMISSIONS ARE LOWER AND THEY DON'T LIKE TO PUT PEOPLE IN THESE PLANS BECAUSE THEY DON'T. HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OR EAT AND THEY THEY WOULD RATHER PUT A MINUTE WITH A COMPANY THAT THEY KNOW. BUT NOW YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO MORE EDUCATION ON THE PRODUCER SIDE. I'M AND I THINK JUST TO TRY TO GET CLOSER TO WRAPPING UP SO. SO WHO STEP TWO DON'T PANIC STOP START SHOPPING. YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS FEELING THAT GEE. YOU KNOW DON'T I HAVE SOME VESTED RIGHTS HERE. I'VE BEEN PAYING FOR THIS POLICY FOR THIRTY YEARS AND YOU KNOW AND ALL THESE YEARS I NEVER HADA CLAIM. HOW CAN THEY JUST DROP ME WHEN I NOTHING'S CHANGED ON MY END. SO YOU KNOW IT PEOPLE ARE PRETTY SHOCKED WHEN YOU SAY. TO THEM THERE'S REALLY NOTHING THAT THIS. DATE OR A LAWYER COULD DO AS LONG AS THEY GAVE YOU FORTY FIVE DAYS NOTICE. AND AS LONG AS THEIR OF. THEIR COMPLYING WITH THEIR OWN UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES AND NOT BEING DISCRIMINATORY OR INCONSISTENT. RIGHT SO. SO AGAIN THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAYBE. YOU KNOW WE WERE LOOKING TO BALANCE RIGHT YOU DON'T WANT. TO SAVING THE INSURERS OKAY NOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THESE PEOPLE YOU DON'T WANT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE HEALTHY FOR OUR MARKET. SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND. SO THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE HOMEOWNERS GET. HAVE A REASONABLE GET TREATED. FAIRLY AND WHEN THEY WHEN THEY GET NON RENEWED. ON THE THIRD PIECE SHOP SMART OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS. HAD HAS REQUIRED NOW THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP A MORE SOPHISTICATED SHOPPING TOOL THAT'S IN PROGRESS. OUR ORGANIZATION HAS HAD A TOOL BASICALLY JUST A SYSTEM CALLED MATCH UP GOING. WHEN THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM LIKE THIS IT BUT REALLY ALL IT IS. WE'RE IN TOUCH WITH VERY PROACTIVE PRO CONSUMER. IN OF AGENTS AND THAT HALF OF THAT WHAT YOU CAN SAY I CAN HELP THESE PEOPLE AND WE JUST. CONNECT THEM WITH THOSE AGENTS IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY SOPHISTICATED BUT IT HAS WORKED. AND THIRD IS THE FAIR PLAN AS A LAST RESORT. SO IN CLOSING I THINK WE HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITIES. HERE FOR PROBLEM SOLVING TOGETHER. WE CONSUMER ASSISTANCE WITH SHOPPING IS A BIG ONE. AND THAT IS IN PROGRESS. GETTING SOME SORT OF MITIGATE FOUGHT WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS IN PLACE AND SAYING IF YOU'VE DONE X. Y. AND Z. YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET DROPPED OR YOU GET SOME KIND OF HELP FOR HAVING BEEN RESPONSIBLE A PROPERTY OWNER I'M I DO THINK WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE FAIR PLANS CAPACITY. IN TERMS OF THEIR STAFFING INYO THEY ARE THERE'S NO QUESTION JULES RIGHT. WE'RE NOT WE'RE JUST IT I THINK WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE MAYBE EVEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MARKET TURBULENCE AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE REALTORS THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A REALTOR PANEL HERE JUST TELLS YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU DO THIS HEARING IN ANOTHER COUPLE MONTHS YOU WELL ON BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS THEY'RE THEY'RE- THEY'RE CONCERNED LEVEL IS GROWING FAST AND ABOUT. TRANSACTION IS NOT BEING ABLE TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE INSURANCE COULDN'T BE PROCURED SO I'D SAY THEN WE DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EVEN IN THE ROUGH STAGES FOR PEOPLE WHO FOR WHOM THE PRICE OF THEIR HOME INSURANCE HAS BECOME A AND UNSUSTAINABLE BURDEN FOR THEM YOU KNOW WHAT THEY HAD BEEN PAYING EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR AND SUDDENLY THERE BILL AS SIX THOUSAND. WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN PLACE WE DON'T HAVE THE SUBSIDIES AND AGAIN IT IT YOU KNOW BECAUSE INSURANCE IS DIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR CONSUMER PRODUCT YOU ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO BUY IT YOU YOU'RE A CAPTIVE IN A SENSE I THINK WE DO HAVE TO DEVELOP SOME SORT OF ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. FOR PEOPLE WITH PREMIUMS SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT THEIR ASSETS I'M FINALLY I DO THINK THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TRY TO GET BACK TO SOME SORT OF A AND A SIMPLER SIMPLER. POLICY THAT SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO BUY A FAIR PLAN POLICY I D. IC. UP FLOOD POLICY EARTHQUAKE FORCE AT. POLICIES YOU KNOW IT JUST LIKE WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS AT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHAT'S AN ESSENTIAL BENEFIT. WHAT IS THE ABSOLUTE MOST ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF SOMEBODY'S HOME THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD BE PROTECTING AND CAN WE- HELP THE MARKET. YOU DEVELOP A SIMPLER BASIC PRODUCT THAT WILL MEET THOSE NEEDS THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD. AND I DO THINK SOME SOME EFFORT HAS TO GO INTO THAT AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE. TIME AND JUST TO MENTION YES WE DO WANT THE COMPETITIVE MARKET TO BOUNCE BACK WE DO WANT YOU KNOW THE AS IT HAS. TYPICALLY THE SMALLER GUYS THAT DON'T HAVE THE BIG YOU KNOW BIG ADVERTISING BUDGETS THAT DON'T SPONSOR THE THOSE BIG SPORTING EVENTS A LOT OF THEM CAN DO HAVE CAPACITY TO TAKE ON MORE. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE BIG BOYS AND SAY WELL IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE GETTING OUT MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD KNOW MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GET IN. SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR AT LEAST IN IS ENGAGING IN DIALOGUE WITH. PRIVATE COMPANIES TO SEE IF SHE CAN CALM THEM DOWN AND GET THEM TAKE ON SOME MORE RISK BECAUSE THERE IS SORT OF THIS. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF EMOTIONAL I THINK YOU KNOW OF PANICKING GOING ON SO THANK YOU FOR BEING THOUGHTFUL AND RESPONSIBLE HERE AND I AM. AVAILABLE. TO HELP IN ANY WAY WE CAN THANK YOU MISS BACH IN THE. THE CONSUMER EDUCATION PROVIDED BY YOUR ORGANIZATION NINE IT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO. TWO FOLKS ALL OVER CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YEAR FOR THAT WORK THAT YOU DO AND ALSO FOR THE PERSPECTIVES THAT YOU SHARED. THIS MORNING AND NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM A LOCAL COUNTY SUPERVISOR MISTER RANDY FLETCHER WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS GO AHEAD SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING AND LISTENING TO. OUR CRISIS IN THE IN THE FIELD. I'VE BEEN A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AND AN INSURANCE BROKER A LITTLE OVER FORTY YEARS. OVER THAT FORTY YEAR PERIOD I'VE ONLY SEEN THIS CRISIS ONE TIME. AND IT CERTAINLY IS FROM MY OPINION. VERY MUCH A CRISIS WHAT I SEE IS. THE TYPICAL ICEBERG AND WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IS ONLY THE BEGINNING UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE OR WHERE WERE HEADED. I SUSPECT WE'RE ALL HERE FOR ONE PRIMARY REASON AND THAT'S TO HELP THE PUBLIC. FROM MY POSITIONING. IT'S GOING TO GET A LOT WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER NONE OF THIS HAPPENED IN A SHORT TERM IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS BEING A MEMBER OF RC RC AND WE BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE TREE MORTALITY THE ISSUES IN THE FOOT HILLS. AND THEN THE FIRES. AND ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN BUILDING. AND I'M IN A I'M IN A REALLY FOCUSES MUCH AS THEY CAN BECAUSE TIME IS VALUABLE ON YOUR PART. BUT THE WAY I'VE SEEN THIS FOR THE LAST. A FEW MONTHS AT LEAST IS THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS TO HEAD DOWN THERE IS THE LONG TERM WORK ON THIS PROBLEM IN THE SHORT TERM. ONE OF THE SHORT TERM OBJECTIVES THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO GET INVOLVED WITH. IS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COVERAGE. TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR DAILY ISSUED NOW. THE LONG TERM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC ATTITUDE THE WAY THEY LOOK AT INSURANCE THE WAY THEY MODIFIED THEIR LIFESTYLE. THE COMMUNITIES HARDENING OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND WORKING ON A STATE PROGRAM. AND I'VE SEEN THAT I'VE BEEN TO MORE COMMITTEE MEETINGS MORE MEETINGS WITH THE STATE THAN I EVER THOUGHT MORE OUT THERE. AN ICY COOPERATION THIS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO I THINK THAT THAT PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE IS ACTUALLY COMING TOGETHER PRETTY WELL. NOW COMES A WHAT CAN WE DO IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I'LL TELL YA JUST IN THE LAST HOUR I'VE HEARD SOME GREAT IDEAS I THINK YOU HAVE A VERY TALENTED ROOM FULL OF EXPERTS HERE. THE RUNNER POSITION THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. AND CAN DO THINGS FOR THE PUBLIC IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND I'M GONNA GIVE IT JUST A COUPLE OF IDEAS THAT I'VE HAD A DISCUSSION WITH ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER ON. I WOULD TAKE THE FAIR PLAN. AND I WOULD TRY AND ENHANCE IT WITH A HUNDRED AND 25% A HUNDRED AND ENSURE THEIR HOUSE. THERE'S LOTS OF DETAILS ATTACHED TO THIS AND I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY. BUT I THINK AGAIN WITHIN A FIVE MINUTE DISCUSSION WITH THE FARE PAYING A PLAN IN THE BACK OF THIS ROOM I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITY IN A WILL TO MAKE CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN ONCE YOU PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE. AND ACTUALLY THINK YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE HERE. I WOULD DO THAT NUMBER ONE. I'D ALSO LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE THE FAIR PLAN WITH SPECIAL FORM COVERAGE. IF THE NOT SPECIAL FORM AT THE VERY LEAST BROAD FORM COVERAGE AND THESE ARE TERMINOLOGIES THAT IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY A LOT OF US TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND AND I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO GO INTO DETAIL AT THIS POINT. I THINK THE LIABILITY IS STILL A CRITICAL PIECE OF AT. WHEN YOU ADD THE LIABILITY TO ANY HOMEOWNERS THE SPECIAL FOR THE SPECIAL AND THE LIABILITY THAT COMES IN THE STANDARD PREFERRED MARKET POLICY THEY'RE NOT EXPENSIVE. YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THEM A BIT AND HAVE EXCLUSIONS RATHER IT'S A PIT BULL AN ELEPHANT OR HER TO CATTLE IN YOUR BACKYARD YOU HAVE EXCLUSIONS BUT YET YOU STILL PROVIDE LIABILITY MOST OF YOUR HOMEOWNER POLICIES AS YOU ALL SAID HERE IF YOU READ THEM YOU'LL FIND. LOTS OF EXCLUSIONS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED. THAT SAME EXCLUSION CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE FAIR PLAN I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE THAT COMPLICATED. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A BIT OF RE UNDERWRITING WITHIN THE FAIR PLAN. THERE ARE SOME PROVISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MODIFIED THAT WOULD BE FINANCIALLY PRUDENT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY INTENTION HERE TO UNDERMINE THE FAIR PLAN. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS A CONSUMER. IS TO HELP THEM BUILD ONE POLICY NOT TO BUILD MULTIPLE POLICIES THAT BEGIN TO GET VERY EXPENSIVE. I'VE HEARD OF THE RATES AND I'VE SEEN THE RATES THAT FROM A STANDARD PREFERRED POLICY IN THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR RANGE ARE NOW SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT IS UNREALISTIC. THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES ON OUR STATE HONOR BUDGET HONOR REAL ESTATE VALUES THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. AND THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO THIS. I'D LITERALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO SEND THIS GROUP. HOW TO MEET ON A REGULAR BASIS OVER THE NEXT THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS TO ACTUALLY COME BACK TO THIS PANEL. AND COMMITTEE AND GIVE THEM SOME HERE'S WHAT WE'VE WORKED OUT. AND IT'S A BENEFICIAL FOR ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. I HAVE TO ADMIT TO YOU WHEN I BECAME A SUPERVISOR I DON'T SPEND THE TIME THAT THEY USED TO IN THE INSURANCE OFFICE AS A MATTER OF FACT I DON'T HAVE A LIFE ANYMORE. THIS IS MY LIFE. AND AS A RESULT. HI I WOULD LIKE TO BRING EVEN BY A STAFF TO THE TABLE OR SOME OTHER STAFFS BECAUSE THEY DEAL WITH THIS COMMUNITY THEIR ELDERLY. THERE ON A LIMITED BUDGET AND THEY'RE IN A MOTIONAL SHOCK IN A LOT OF CASES MY STAFF TURN INTO BE COUNSELORS ON THE TELEPHONE TRYING TO KEEP THE PUBLIC FROM A- MENTAL BREAKDOWN. TO ENCOURAGE THEM THAT WERE WORKING ON THEIR PROBLEMS AND WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM THE BEST WE CAN WITH WHAT WE HAVE. SO FROM YOUR POSITION IT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL MISTER FLETCHER A THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A- AS A COUNTY OFFICIAL IN A NEARBY COUNTY AS WELL AS YOUR INSURANCE BACKGROUND. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR POSITIVE. SUGGESTIONS A VERY WELL. THE BILL A WELL REGARDED AND MUCH APPRECIATED WE'RE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND SCHEDULE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO IF THERE NO QUESTION SOMEONE OF A BRING UP THE FOURTH PANEL AND THE AGAIN MISTER FLETCHER AND MISBACH THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. THIS LAST PANEL WILL BE A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE INSURANCE. AND ENSURE PERSPECTIVE. MR REX FRAZIER IS WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH INCLUDES MANY OF THE. MAJOR INSURANCE COMPANIES IN OUR STATE AND ALSO MARK SECT IN. VICE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION SO YOU'VE HAD THE BENEFIT OF HEARING SOME OF THE OF THE PREVIOUS A PRESENTATIONS PLEASE GO AHEAD MR FRAZIER YES SIR I HAVE A PREPARED STATEMENT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S REX FRAZIER I'M PRESIDENT THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ABOUT HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE REGULATION AND PRICING ISSUES WITH HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AVAILABILITY WHICH MY COLLEAGUE WILL ADDRESS IN GREATER DEPTH HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN SEVERAL REGULATORY DECISIONS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE POLICY CHOICES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE PARTICULAR BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE. DECISIONS. AND INSURERS ABILITY TO SERVE COMMUNITIES THREATENED BY WILD FIRE. IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. WHICH HAS A DUAL ROLE. ON THE ONE HAND THE DEPARTMENTS AND POWER TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE RATES AND CAN EVEN ORDER INSURERS TO REDUCE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED RATES THAT IT BELIEVES HAVE BECOME EXCESSIVE OVERTIME. ON THE OTHER HAND. THE DEPARTMENT MUST MONITOR SOLVENCY TO ENSURE THAT INSURERS CAN PAY CLAIMS SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEIR PROMISES. IN THIS BALANCING ACT IF THE DEPARTMENT RESTRAINTS AND INSURANCE RATES TO AGGRESSIVELY THE PLACES FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON THAT INSURER WHICH WILL THEN. REDUCE WILL RESPOND BY REDUCING EXPOSURE TO HIGHER RISK AREAS. THE DEPARTMENT HAS APPROACHED RATE REGULATION IN A MANNER VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS AS OF TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD THE THIRTY SECOND HIGHEST AVERAGE HOMEOWNERS PREMIUM IN THE COUNTRY. AND WHEN ADJUSTED FOR AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME THAT NUMBER DROPPED TO FORTY THIRD. THIS LOWER PREMIUM LEVEL WAS A STARK CHANGE FROM SEVERAL YEARS EARLIER WHEN INTO TWO THOUSAND NINE CALIFORNIA HAD THE FOURTEENTH HIGHEST AVERAGE PREMIUM. DURING THAT PERIOD THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNERS PREMIUM IN THE NATION INCREASE BY A TOTAL OF 45% WHAT CALIFORNIA'S AVERAGE ONLY INCREASED BY EIGHT POINT ONE PERCENT. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIA CPI DURING THAT PERIOD WAS 14% SO RATES AVERAGE PREMIUM LEVELS OF NOT EVEN KEPT UP WITH INFLATION. HURRICANE EXPOS STATES SUCH AS LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA NOW HAVE AVERAGE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE PREMIUMS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT OF CALIFORNIA. WELL THE ADMITTED MARKET CARRIERS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT RATE INADEQUACY LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND RESIDENTS IN HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS HAVE VOICE THE OPPOSITE WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT HIGH PRICES AND THIS IS A DISCONNECT WORTH SIGNIFICANT CONSIDERATION. WHILE THE GULF COAST STATES HAVE ALREADY HAD A CLIMATE DRIVEN INCREASE IN INSURANCE RATES CALIFORNIA HAS NOT. CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS NOT REQUIRED BY STATUTE BUT CHOICES HAD THAT HAVE BEEN MADE CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT INSURERS FROM USING CLIMATE CHANGE MODELING AND PRICING. INSTEAD REQUIRING INSURERS TO PREDICT FUTURE LOSSES BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OF LOSSES. CALIFORNIA'S RECOGNITION OF A NEW NORMAL DOES NOT YET EXTEND TO INSURANCE RATES. THIS CLIMATE CHANGE RESTRICTION IS ON TOP OF CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED REGULATORY PROHIBITION ON ALLOWING INSURERS TO INCLUDE THEIR ACTUAL COST OF REINSURANCE AND THEIR INSURANCE RATES. AS THE WORLD REINSURANCE MARKET RECOGNIZES CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE RISK IN SEEKS HIGHER PRICES FROM CALIFORNIA INSURERS CALIFORNIA RATING RULES CONTINUE THE LEGAL FICTION THAT INSURANCE DO NOT BUY REINSURANCE. PERCEPTION OF CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE RISK AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION HAS CHANGED. S. AND P. GLOBAL RATINGS RECENTLY KNOWLEDGE THIS CHANGE BY ADDING WILD VIRUS TO THE LIST OF DISASTERS THE IMPLICATE AND SURE CREDIT WORTHINESS. WHICH HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN LIMITED TO ONLY TORNADOES HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKE RISK. REINSURERS OF HAD THREE YEARS IN A ROW OF WILDFIRE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF TEN BILLION DOLLARS DUE TO THE CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN CANADA AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND SIMILAR FIRES IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN. NOT SURPRISINGLY THERE'S ALARM AMONG RATING ANALYSTS. REINSURERS AND PRIMARY INSURERS ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OF WILD FIRE RISK MODELING UNDERWRITING PRACTICES AND RATE LEVELS. S. AND P. RECENTLY PREDICTED THAT REINSURANCE PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA WILD RISK COULD RISE TWENTY TWENTY RENEWALS. IF CALIFORNIA ENSURE MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO THIS CATASTROPHIC RISK THEY WILL BE EXPECTED TO PAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED REINSURANCE PREMIUMS WHAT CALIFORNIA RULES PREVENT THAT COST RECOVERY WE URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THE SITUATION THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA REINSURANCE REGULATIONS ARE CREATING. WILD FAR CATASTROPHE MODELS ARE IMPROVING AND WE DO EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE IMPROVEMENT. AS THE SCIENCE ADVANCES THE REST THAT INSURERS AND REINSURERS WILL BE UNDER UNDERESTIMATING FIRE RISK WILL REDUCE. WHICH WILL IN TURN REDUCE CONCERNS ABOUT ENSURE CREDIT WERE CREDIT WORTHINESS BUT WE HAVE LIKELY TRANSITIONED IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WILD FIRE RISK WHICH WILL NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED A SECONDARY RISK MOVING FORWARD. DESPITE THE LID ON PRICING IN THE LAST DECADE IN THE EMERGENCY OF WILD FIRE RISK AS A CREDIT IMPACTING CONSIDERATION. STATE WIDE AVAILABILITY NUMBERS ARE RELATIVELY STABLE WITH THE DEPARTMENTS RECENT REPORT SHOWING FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THAT THE NUMBER OF NEW HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED STATEWIDE AS INCREASED ONE POINT 8% THE NUMBER OF POLICY HOLDER INITIATED NON RENEWALS HAS INCREASED ONE POINT 7% MEANING THEIR SHOPPING. WHILE THE NUMBER OF INSURER INITIATED NON RENEWALS HAS DECREASED THREE POINT 9% OF THE POLICY HOLDERS NON RENEWED BY THE INSURERS ONLY 13% AND UP IN THE FAIR PLAN. THESE NUMBERS EXIST DESPITE EFFORTS OF INSURERS TO EVALUATE THEIR BUSINESS AND ENSURE THEY'RE NOT AIR RESPONSIBLY OVER CONCENTRATED TO ANY SINGLE CATASTROPHIC RISK AREA. THIS IS ASOLVENCY RISK OF IMPORTANCE TO INSURERS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF LIKE. WITH THE MOST RECET WORST CASE SCENARIO BEING MERCED PROPERTY IN CASUALTIES FAILURE FOLLOWING A SINGLE FIRE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT REGULATION AND PRICING ISSUES AN ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT AVAILABILITY ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER OF OTHER ANY QUESTIONS FOR MISTER FRAZIER ON THE DATA THAT HE HAS PROVIDED TO US. VERY VERY HELPFUL SIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. MR SEGMENT PROVIDING WITH MARK SEGMENT A VICE PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALLY IS INSURANCE ASSOCIATION I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER PART OF THE EQUATION WHICH IS AVAILABILITY. NOT RENEWALS HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS A LOT I APPRECIATE THE TERM AND DALY POINTING OUT THAT THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WAS OVER A- FOUR YEAR PERIOD IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAME DATA. AS REX KIND OF POINTED OUT NEW POLICIES ARE OVER TWO MILLION IN THAT SAME AREAS WHICH WERE TALK ABOUT NON RENEWAL SO IT'S IMPORTANT. TO TRY BUT CONTACTS ON THIS MY BOSS IS ALWAYS AFTER ME TO PROVIDE CONTEXT MIGHT TRY TO WHENEVER POSSIBLE. I THINK THE OTHER THING WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES. I LIVE IN CHARGE IS AVAILABLE BUT AN INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT LIKE THE PRICE WHICH WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE PRICES ARE GOING UP THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS NOT HAVING A CHAIRED. CHARTS AVAILABLE TO YOU WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS THAT WE USE THAT SOMEWHAT TO JUDGE WHETHER NOT THE VOLUNTARY MARKET IS WORKING. OUT WE HAVE THREE TOOLS WE HAVE THE FAIR PLAN. YOUR TO PRESENTATION FROM THEM THAT THEY HAVE. SOME. INCREASED BUT NOT DRAMATIC INCREASES YOU HEARD FROM THE SURPLUS LINES INJURED. INDUSTRY THAT THEY HAVE SOME INCREASE BUT NOT A DRAMATIC INCREASE. ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE USE IS WHETHER NOT. HOMEOWNERS ARE UNABLE TO FIND INSURANCE AND THEREFORE THEIR LENDER PLACES AND CHARTS ON THE PROPERTY TO PROTECT THE LENDER. I KNOW HAVING HAD THIS HAPPEN TO BE ONCE. A BY MISTAKE. ODD THAT THE POLICIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE. I THE COVERAGES MARCH LESS AND IT REALLY REALLY GETS YOUR ATTENTION. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WE HAVE NOT HEARD MUCH ABOUT LENDER PLACED IN CHARGE OF THIS MARKET PLACE. WHICH WOULD BE LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO FIND INSURANCE SOMEWHERE TO MAKE SURE THEY MEET THEIR MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS. ONE THING WE DISCOVERED AB TALKED ABOUT THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE INSURANCE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WE BOTH SERVED ON. IT WAS AS MUCH FUN AS YOU COULD IMAGINE. ONE OF THAT WE HAD THIS DEBATE. CONSTANTLY ABOUT AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY AND NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND IT WHETHER OR NOT INSURANCE WAS AVAILABLE A PART OF IT CAME DOWN TO WE GET STARTED TO UNDERSTAND THE MARKETS AND UNDERSTAND THAT COMPETITION IN THE MARKET AND CONSUMERS ARE NOT ALWAYS AWARE HOW TO SHOP FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A CAPTIVE AGENT AND THAT AGENT SAYS THAT COMPANIES NO LONGER WRITING YOU MAY BELIEVE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS NOT AVAILABLE. BECAUSE YOU'RE USED TO THAT RELATIONSHIP IF YOU WORK WITH AN AGENT WHO MAY ONLY HAVE A SMALL A COUPLE OF APPOINTMENTS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A BROAD PERSPECTIVE ON THE MARKET YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THAT INSURANCE IS AVAILABLE WE PUSH PEOPLE TO SHOP FOR INSURANCE WE'D LIKE THEM TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AND WAS STILL WATER RECTORS LIGHTS. TO SHOP FOR INSURANCE IS A SPEND OUT SHOPPING FOR A HAMMER ON AMAZON. ARE THE INSURANCE THE COMMUNITY HAS INVOLVED THAT AFFECT LAST YEAR THERE WAS A BILL THAT WILL CREATE A CALIFORNIA CHURCH FINDER WITH CONSTANT PAIN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING INSURANCE CAN PUT THEIR INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE. AGENTS AND COMPANIES THAT WRITE THAT INSURANCE WILL CONTINUE TO FIND THAT PLACE OF THIS WAS PILOTED ON A SMALL PROJECT THAT'S HERE CAN'T AND PLASTER COUNTY WHICH WE'VE FOUND OUT TO BE VERY WORKING. INTEREST LAY ENOUGH I WAS ACTUALLY TAX IN WITH ONE OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES WHICH DOES WRITING GRASS VALLEY THEY DO SEE COMPETITION AND RIGHT GRASS VALLEY SOMETIMES THEY GET ANNOYED THAT THEY GET OUT OF BED AND GRASS VALLEY WHICH IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE PARTICULAR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT WE FACE. AND JUST PLAY ENOUGH AT THE SAME INSURANCE COMPANY THAT AT LEAST DIVIDE WAS TALK ABOUT WORKING WITH SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT WOULD THAT WOULD COME ON THE SAME DATE. SO WE JUST AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK. THE BILL THAT THE CHAIRS PUSHING TODAY AND THAT SENATE JOINT COMMITTEE TAKE SOME STEPS TO UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE WE TAKE ANY BROAD. OF STEPS THAT MAY UPSET THE GENERAL INDUSTRY WE. NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAD FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THANK YOU. MARK A THE PILOT PROJECT THAT YOU MENTIONED OF WHO'S THE SPONSOR OF THAT IT'S A GROUP THAT CAME OUT OF THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE IT'S A GROUP CALLED WHY A COPA WHICH IS THE VENDOR THAT DOES IT AND IT'S CALLED SIERRA INSURANCE FINDER. OF ED WE WERE GETTING REPORTS WHEN THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE INSURANCE UP CAN WILL STILL MADE AND THEN THEY WERE FINDING PRETTY GOOD SUCCESS WITH PEOPLE OF FINDING INSURANCE THROUGH THAT MECHANISM. FOR HOW MANY MONTHS HAS THAT BEEN UNDER WAY THAT. PROGRAM I WOULD SAY IT'S BETTER TO HAVE PARK AT LEAST A YEAR. GOOD THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY QUESTIONS FOR A MISTER FRAZIER OR MISTER SECOND. MR VOEPEL I HAVE JUST A COMMENT. IN MAINLY FOR THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE I HOLD ON I BELIEVE FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT INSURANCE LICENSES BUT I'VE BEEN RETIRED FROM THE INSURANCE BUSINESS FOR THREE YEARS ALTHOUGH I DO RENEW THEM AND I THINK THE THING I BRING TO THE TABLE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. IS SIMPLY AN UNDERSTANDING FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES VIEW POINT THE BROKER VIEWPOINT AND THE CONSUMER VIEWPOINT TRYING TO EQUALIZE AND BALANCE THE MALL WHICH IF I COULD EVER FIGURE THAT OUT I'D BE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD. NO IT'S IT IT THANK YOU MISTER VOEPEL IT REALLY TRULY IS HELPFUL TO HAVE YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF YOUR BACKGROUND. INSURANCE IS A COMPLICATED WORLD AS IS REAL ESTATE AS AS ARE MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF OUR MODERN ECONOMY HERE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY MEMBERS OF MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO JOIN THE HEARING THIS MORNING I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION THAT WE HEARD FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT PANELS. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT JUST SO THE COMMITTEE KNOWS THAT I'VE HEARD A LOT. IN TALKING WITH FOLKS OF MY DISTRICT ONE IS THE ALI'I ISSUE. OF THERE WERE SEVERAL HOMES IT DIDN'T BURN DOWN RIGHT BUT STILL HAD INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS WATER CONTAMINATION OR SMOKE DAMAGE THAT. THAT I DID GET COMPLAINTS FROM THOSE CONSUMERS THAT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO ACCESS SALIH THEIR THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY LITERALLY SAID NO THAT'S IT'S NOT FOR THIS. AND COULD NOT GET A LEAD BECAUSE THE HOME ITSELF WAS NOT. DAMAGED PHYSICALLY BY THE FIRE BUT IT BUT CERTAINLY IF YOU CAN'T GO BACK IN YOUR HOME BECAUSE OF THOSE ISSUES. YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD COVER US THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO THE OTHER ONE I GOT A LOT OF THIS IS THE DEDUCTION FOR LAND VALUE WHEN PEOPLE ARE PURCHASING. REPLACEMENT PROPERTY. DEBT THAT WAS RUN INTO ISSUES WITH NOT BE ABLE TO TRULY GET THE FULL VALUE OF WHAT THEY PAID FOR IN PREMIUMS. IN AND THEIR HOST HOME BURNED DOWN YOU HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER HOME. TO ROUTE TO REPLACE IT SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS ALSO SOMETHING I HEARD. AND I JUST YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET SOMEWHERE ON THIS BECAUSE- CERTAINLY I THINK THERE IS A ROBUST MARKET OUT THERE AT THAT BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE A SLIVER. OUT THERE WERE IT'S NOT SO ROBUST AND WERE HAVING ISSUES AND WE CAN SAY OH YEAH THERE'S AVAILABILITY THERE'S AVAILABILITY. AND I AND I KEEP SAYING THIS WILL TELL ME WHO THE COMPANIES ARE AND WHILE GET OUT THE WORD TO MY COME TO MY CONSTITUENTS. HEY MAN CHECK TRY THESE COMPANIES BUT. YOU KNOW I DON'T ALWAYS GET NAMES THEY GET WHAT WHAT HE'S TALKING THE SAME COMPANY WHAT COMPANY IS IT. TO SAY WHAT COMPANY IT IS AND THEN WE'LL GET OUT THE WORD TO PEOPLE THAT HEY THERE ARE. PEOPLE WRITING THESE AND THEN AFFORDABILITY IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE AND- I THINK EVERYBODY EXPECTS A YOU HAVE HIGHER RISK. YOU DO HAVE TO PAY MORE. BUT MAN WHEN YOU GET IN LIKE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. NO PREMIUMS THAT'S I THINK THAT'S PRETTY ROUGH FOR ANYBODY IT TAKES OF WE CAN FIND. SOME REFORMS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP ADDRESS THAT A FOR MIDDLE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND THANK YOU FOR BY THE COMMITTEE AND THEY'VE BEEN DOWN AS A LOT OF THESE ISSUES IN THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU'RE OFFERING.

GETTING A LOT OF THESE NON RENEWAL NOTICES AND WE HEAR ABOUT THIS PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY FROM MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD HANNAH SUPERVISOR FLETCHER SITS ON OUR BOARD WE PROBABLY CALL HIM A MEMBER OF OURS AND SO I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO ADD FROM BEYOND WHAT HE SAID HERE TODAY DURING HIS TESTIMONY BUT I WILL SAY THAT.

THE HEARING. PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR. HI HOW YOU DOING MY NAME IS PHIL WHEN I'M AN INSURANCE BROKER IN EL DORADO HILLS. I'D SAY THE MAJORITY MY CLIENT BASE IS REPRESENTED IN EL DORADO COUNTY AND FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE THE FAIR PLAN. I'VE GOT COUNTERPARTS IN COLORADO AND SOME MORE MARKET SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTS THAT THE DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THEY OR THEIR OPTION IS ONLY GOING WITH A MINUTE. CARRIERS IN THE SAME SCENARIO. YOU'RE JUST KIND OF GOING FORWARD HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND DECEMBER WAS THE FIRST TIME I WROTE. A FAIR PLAN POLICY. AND THIS WHEN THE NON ON RULES STARTED COME THROUGH FOR PEOPLE. AND I THINK PEOPLE. IT MADE SENSE THEY WERE SHOCKED IT MADE SENSE THEY TOOK THINGS IN STRIDE. AND THEN ONCE THE FOUR ONE. RATE INCREASE HIT. ALL THE SOLUTIONS REALLY BECAME A SUPER UNREASONABLE AND OTHERS. TO SO I DEFINITELY THINK THERE'S SOME FACTORS ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT FOR THE FAIR PLANTED. TO ENHANCE THEIR PRODUCT TO LOOK AT DISCOUNTS RIGHT NOW THE ONLY DISCOUNT AVAILABLE AS THE FIRE WISE. COMMUNITY DISCOUNT WHICH IS A 10% DISCOUNT. PARADISE WAS ACTUALLY. CLASSIFIED IN FAR WHY IS. A FAR WISE COMMUNITY. IN EL DORADO COUNTY I THINK PERSONALLY FLATS IS THE ONLY. ONE THAT'S- BASED ON THAT SO AS FAR AS ERRORS. OF OPPORTUNITY I WOULD SAY DISCOUNTS WOULD BE GREAT ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT PEOPLE DO TAKE MEASURES TO MAKE THEIR HOUSE MORE FIRE SAFE YOU KNOW THE TERM HARDENING HOME RATHER. STEPS ON THERE'S NO DISCOUNT FOR ANY OF THAT THOSE EFFORTS. ON IT ACTUALLY COST MORE YOUR INSURANCE COSTS MORE BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE INCREASING REPLACEMENT COST. SO THE SO THE COST TO REPLACE YOUR HOME WOULD BE MORE SO. THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME AREAS WHERE I DON'T THINK WE'RE FOR IN THE SHORT TERM THERE COULD BE SOME THINGS THAT COULD BE LOOKED AT TO MAKE THINGS MORE REASONABLE. FOR CONSUMERS IT IT'S BEEN. REALLY SHOCKING TO SEE IT YOU KNOW EVEN IN CASES WHERE. THE FIRE HYDRANT IS. JUST A FOOT PASSED A THOUSAND FEET FROM THEIR HOUSE THAT COMMUNITY FRIENDS OF A THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR PREMIUM DIFFERENCE LITERALLY BECAUSE THE FIRE HYDRANTS. JUST NOT ONE FOOT CLOSER AND SIMILAR WITH THE FIRE THE FIRE STATION SITUATION IT'S A BIG ISSUE THERE'S- YOUR I KNOW IN ELDORADO COUNTY THERE'S FIVE THERE'S A FEW CASES WHERE THE FIRE HAD FIRE STATIONS. ARE NOT CONSIDERED MAN FULL TIME. THE MANDARIN THE FIRE SEASON WHERE MATTERS THE NOT MANNED DURING THE SNOW YOU KNOW MONTHS BUT THEY'RE NOT ELDRED SO THAT AGAIN THAT'S A- ABOUT A THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR IMPACT THEIR PREMIUM. BECAUSE THE FIRE STATION THAT'S DOWN THE STREET IS CONSIDERED MAN SO THERE'S JUST SOME THINGS ON THE SHORT TERM THE CAN WE LOOK AT THE COULD DEFINITELY. MOVE THE NEEDLE MAKING THINGS MORE REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE BY AND LARGE YOU KNOW I WOULD SAIL DRAW COUNTY FOLKS ARE. WORK VERY HARD TO KEEP THE PROPERTY SAFE AND CLEAR THEY DON'T ARGUE ABOUT THAT THEY ARE. SMART IN THAT RESPECT AND THEY THERE'D ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED BY THESE INCREASES AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN A FULL TERM OF THIS IS REALLY STARTED TO HIT HEAVY. IN DECEMBER AND ONCE A FULL CYCLE HITS. ON. YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY GONNA SEE DIFFERENCE I OFFER FIVE THE DAC. CARRIER SO I AM ABLE TO. ACCORD ABOUT THIRTY POLICIES A DAY AND IN A LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE CENTER THAT'S AVAILABLE EVEN ADMITTED CARRIERS. WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE FAIR PLAN. ON THOSE KIND OF BOILS DOWN TO THE SAME. CAN THE SAME PACKAGE AND ANY HOUSE THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAVE I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT YOU WITH IF THE- THAT. THEY'RE OPEN FOR DIALOGUE THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME THINGS IN THE SHORT TERM THE COULD MOVE THE NEEDLE FOR THE CONSUMERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE TODAY AND FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS AN INSURANCE AGENT. FOR SHOULD. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD SIR. JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT. INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS. OF CALIFORNIA AND- I JUST WANT TO COMMENT A LITTLE BIT FROM THE- AGENT BROKER FOR SPECTRUM I APPRECIATE THIS. THESE COMMENTS HERE. YOU ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT LACK OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. IS CAUSING. ISSUES IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS WALL. FOR OUR MEMBERS THEIR LIVELIHOOD IS SELLING INSURANCE SO IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR THEM AS WELL. THERE WERE I JUST WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THEY'RE WORKING HARD. NOT ONLY IS INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR- OWN BUSINESSES AND THEIR CUSTOMERS. BUT THEY'RE WORKING WITH YOUR TRADE ASSOCIATION TO REACH OUT FOR. ADDITIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS I THINK. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE EVER WRITTEN A FAIR PLAN POLICY. SO THEY'RE LEARNING THAT AS WELL. I'M GETTING. MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE- NOT A BIT MARKET WITH INSURANCE WHOLESALERS. WHAT'S OUR MEMBERS BELONG TO CONSOLIDATORS. NOW DO. SO THEY HAVE MORE VOLUME DAHLE FOR CARRIERS. SO IN OUR BUSINESS IS WORKING REALLY HARD. AT IT THERE'S STILL A LOT TO LEARN AND- THIS IS GOING TO BE AWHILE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER NORWOOD AND BY THE WAY A LITTLE BIRDIE TOLD ME THAT. TO YOUR NEW GRANDFATHER SO CONGRATULATIONS. GRADUATION. ALL RIGHT IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER PUBLIC OLD. GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME'S I LEARNED HERNANDEZ I'M FROM POSSIBLE IN EL DORADO COUNTY AND I'M WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND I'LL TRY TO COUNTY TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE ANYTHING BECAUSE POLITICAL OFFICIALS YOU UNDERSTAND THIS THIS ISSUE IS AFFECTING OUR COMMUNITY SO MUCH THAT WE HAVE FORMED A BAG BIPARTISAN COALITION THAT HAS NEVER EXISTED BEFORE SO ARE REPUBLICAN CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN CHAIR AND DEMOCRATIC CENTRAL COMMITTEE CHAIR. AND OUR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND OUR EL DORADO COUNTY ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HAVE FORMED A STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUP IN OUR LETTER WILL BE PRESENTED FORMALLY ANNOUNCING THIS THIS WEEK BUT COME TO THE TABLE AND SIT DOWN TO SAY LET'S WORK TOGETHER AND LET'S FIND COMMON GROUND AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR. OF OUR COMMITTEES EXISTING SO GOOD FOR YOU FOR YOU THINK YOU AND WE WERE IN ARE YOU ON THAT ON THAT. I AM YES NO I AM SURE OF OUR POLICY COMMITTEE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE. POSSIBLY TO EXPORT LOOKING AT A I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S AN OPTION BUT FIELD HEARINGS. WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. I DILIGENTLY TRACK WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ARE AND LEARNING TO AT THE LEGISLATURE BUT MOST PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE AWARE OF THIS AND THERE I THINK THAT. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AT THE TABLE WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED. AND IT'S SOMETHING WE ADVOCATED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN THE COMMISSIONER WHO HAS. STARTED COMING OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES AND MEETING WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT STEP BUT I THINK IT'S A LEGISLATURE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DIRECTLY PART OF THAT I'M GLAD TO SEE THE TESTIMONY. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE PRESENTED TODAY ARTICULATES WHAT THEY'RE HEARING ON THE GROUND BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THIS IS A- THIS IS A PEOPLE ISSUE WE ARE ONE CALIFORNIA AND- WHILE YOU MAY HEAR THAT. THE MARKET OVERALL IS HEALTHY WELL IT IS INDEED WE CALL IT A CRISIS WERE WERE THERE. THIS IS AFFECTING LIVELIHOODS OF PEOPLE AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE WHO. THEY TALK ABOUT THE MORTGAGE COVERAGE OF THE MORTGAGE REQUIREMENT WHILE WE LIVE IN A AS AN ELDERLY POPULATION AND PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO THAT POINT IN. LIFE WHETHER IT WILL TO. FINALLY PERHAPS OFF THEIR LOANS AND NOW HAVE TO TAKE OUT ADDITIONAL. LOANS JUST TO BE FOR SURE IT'S. AND THIS IS THESE ARE. PEOPLE LIVING GLAMOROUS LIVES AND SUPER EXPENSIVE HOMES THESE ARE PEOPLE LIKE MY PARENTS WHO. ARE COUNTING EMPLOYEES MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO OF WORKS THEIR WHOLE LIVES TO PAY OFF THIS ASSET TO NOW FIND OUT THAT THE- COULD GET DROPPED FROM THEIR INSURANCE WHERE THEY WERE PAYING AROUND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR. NEVER MADE A CLAIM ON THEIR POLICY OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND NOW THEIR ONLY OPTION IS. NEARLY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BACK SIGNIFICANT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S JUST GETTING READY TO RETIRE.
