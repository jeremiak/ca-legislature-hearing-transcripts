01:44:09.443 --> 01:44:10.911
FIRST AMONG THOSE GOOD BACK

01:44:10.978 --> 01:44:12.746
THERE OBSTACLES IMPEDING ABLE

IN THE NEED TO INSTILL TRUST-

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:25.659
TO BUILD THESE ACCOUNTS STILL

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:29.329
EXIST- AN EXPANSION OF THE ABLE

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:32.099

THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IS ALSO A

01:44:39.272 --> 01:44:41.675
KEY DRIVER FOR CONTINUE ABLE

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:43.777
SUCCESS. THE OTHER CRITICAL

01:44:43.844 --> 01:44:45.178
LESSON THAT WE'VE LEARNED IN

01:44:45.245 --> 01:44:46.380
THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:47.948
BALL IS THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS

01:44:48.015 --> 01:44:51.151
MADE PRIOR TO ESTABLISHING

01:44:51.218 --> 01:44:51.685
CALIFORNIA THEY BLACK WERE

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:54.354
INACCURATE. THE GROWTH COME AT

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:55.288
A SMALLER PLACE THAN ORIGINALLY

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:56.990
ESTIMATED. AND THE WAY THEY

01:44:57.057 --> 01:44:58.859
WHICH ACCOUNT HOLDERS ARE USING

01:44:58.925 --> 01:45:00.761
THEIR ACCOUNTS VERY VASTLY.

01:45:00.827 --> 01:45:02.129
FROM THE FIVE TWENTY NINE

01:45:02.195 --> 01:45:03.563
COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAM THAT

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.032
ABEL WAS MODELED AFTER.

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:06.933
TRANSACTION A COMPONENT OF ABLE

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.268
WHICH IS NOT A FEATURE OF

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:10.170
COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAMS ME

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:11.638
THAT ASSETS HELD IN ABLE

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:13.807
ACCOUNTS HAVE GENERATED LESS

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:14.307
REVENUE THAN ORIGINALLY

01:45:14.374 --> 01:45:16.076
PROJECTED. WHICH WILL RESULT IN

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:17.911
A LONGER THAN EXPECTED TIMELINE

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.146
FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE SELF

THE PROGRAM SINCE ITS INCEPTION.

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:26.920
IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE OUR

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:28.121
ABILITY TO ACHIEVE SELF

01:45:28.188 --> 01:45:30.457

REQUEST THAT FUNDING FOR CALLIE

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:41.268
WILL SHIFT FROM LOANS TO AN

01:45:41.334 --> 01:45:44.037
ANNUAL APPROPRIATION UNTIL THE-

01:45:44.104 --> 01:45:46.540
THE POINT THAT THE PROGRAM

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:47.841
REACHES SELF SUSTAINABILITY. AN

01:45:47.908 --> 01:45:49.643
ANNUAL APPROPRIATION WILL

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:51.978
ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR FUTURE

01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:57.384
ESSENTIAL STEP IN THE LONG TERM

UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES PEOPLE

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:08.028
THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION TO

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:09.329

GROWTH OF ACCOUNTS AND ASSETS

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:18.138
WILL BE THE KEY DRIVERS FOR

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:20.707
SUSTAINABILITY. ONE SELF

01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:22.509
SUSTAINABLE CALIBER WILL NO

LONGER NEED FUNDING FROM THE

STATE. AND WHILE CALIBER COULD

01:46:25.445 --> 01:46:27.347
CONTINUE TO RELY UPON THINKING

01:46:27.414 --> 01:46:29.249

GIVEN REPAYMENT OF LONG JET.

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:22.495
THE STAFF ANALYSIS POINTS OUT

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:23.563
THAT BASED ON THE CURRENT FEE

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:25.532
STRUCTURES IS ESTIMATED

01:48:36.476 --> 01:48:38.578
ESTIMATE ON WHEN THE PROGRAM

WILL ACHIEVE SELF

01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:42.115
SUSTAINABILITY. WE DO WE'VE

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:44.918
DONE- GROWTH PROJECTIONS AND

01:48:44.985 --> 01:48:47.787
LIKE- LIKE I SAID PREVIOUSLY-

01:48:47.854 --> 01:48:49.289
GROWTH OF THE PROGRAM IN A

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:52.392
DOWNTURN OUT THAT. WILL BE THE

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:55.095
PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE- I'M

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:57.230
BASED ON TWO SEPARATE SCENARIOS

01:48:57.297 --> 01:49:01.401
WE SEE THE PROGRAM- IN A

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:03.403
MODERATE CASE ACHIEVING SELF

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:07.707
SUSTAINABILITY- BY- FISCAL YEAR

01:49:07.774 --> 01:49:10.143
TWENTY THIRTY- ED ARE LOWER

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:15.415
CASE THEY COULD GO OUT- INTO

01:49:15.482 --> 01:49:17.317
THE TWENTY FORTY. SO WE'RE

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:18.585
TALKING A BEST CASE SCENARIO

01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:20.186
SAID MODERATES GONNA BE TEN

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:22.589
YEARS WORST CASE SCENARIO

01:49:22.656 --> 01:49:23.456
TWENTY YEARS SO I MEAN THE

01:49:23.523 --> 01:49:24.891
PROGRAMS A VERY WORTHWHILE AND

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:27.494
GREAT PROGRAM BUT- STILL WITH.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:30.297
ME WHAT. DO WE HAVE DIRECT TO

01:49:30.363 --> 01:49:31.898
GUARANTEE AYE I GUESS FOR LACK

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:34.567
OF A BETTER WORD THAT THIS

01:49:34.634 --> 01:49:36.736
PROGRAM WILL EVENTUALLY SUCCEED.

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:38.405
YEAH THAT SAID SO THEY ARE

01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:39.539
NEVER QUESTION THAT I THINK

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:42.075
THAT THAT IS. A GREAT ISSUE BUT

01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:44.844
THEIR NUMBER VARIABLES- BUT THE

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:46.613
PRIMARY VERY WELL LIKE I SAID

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.281
IS ELIGIBILITY AND IT'S BEEN

01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:52.786
BASED ON- THE DISABILITY

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:55.288
BEGINNING BEFORE- AND ARBITRARY

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:57.757
AGE OF TWENTY SIX- THERE'S BEEN

01:49:57.824 --> 01:49:59.359
SUBSTANTIAL MOVEMENT ON THAT ON

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:00.961
THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO RAISE THAT

01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:03.496
TO. FORTY SIX THAT WILL VASTLY

01:50:03.563 --> 01:50:04.798
IMPROVE THE ELIGIBILITY

01:50:04.864 --> 01:50:07.100
POPULATION AND COULD

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:08.969
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE GROWTH

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:11.805
NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE- PROJECTED

01:50:11.871 --> 01:50:14.507
CURRENTLY. BOB I THINK THAT

01:50:14.574 --> 01:50:16.343
WOULD BE THE OVERALL ACCEPTANCE

01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:19.546
OF THE PROGRAM- HAS BEEN STRONG

01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:22.315
AND THAT- NATIONWIDE- BUT THE

01:50:22.382 --> 01:50:23.850
REALITY IS THAT IT WILL TAKE

01:50:23.917 --> 01:50:28.355
TIME TO- TO GENERATE THESE- TO

01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:30.390
GENERATE THE ACCOUNT UP. THE

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:35.195
AMOUNT OF- OF GROWTH THAT WE

01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:38.732
NEED. I THANK YOU YOUR SURE

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:39.666
WILL NOT NONE OF US WILL BE

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:41.368
HERE AND IN TEN YEARS LEVEL IN

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:44.070
TWENTY YEARS SO I GUESS IS JUST

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:45.338
TRYING TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:47.974
THE PUBLIC'S MONEY IN OTHER

01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:49.909
THERE REALLY ARE NO GUARANTEES

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:52.312
THAT IT THAT IT WILL DO IT SO

01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:54.814
AT WHAT POINT- YOU KNOW WHAT

01:50:54.881 --> 01:50:56.916
WOULD BE THE- IT'S JUST COMING

01:50:56.983 --> 01:50:59.452
BACK FROM FOR MORE MONEY- SO

01:50:59.519 --> 01:51:01.788
WHAT POINT DO WE- DO WE- CAN'T

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:03.523
WAIT ANOTHER TEN YEARS BECAUSE-

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:04.958
TO A TEN MORE YEARS TILL TWENTY

01:51:05.025 --> 01:51:06.726
THIRTY. THE PROGRAM ALL BEEN

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:10.997
EXISTENCE WHAT. SIXTEEN YEARS-

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:12.365
IT'S BEEN EXISTENCE HOW LONG

01:51:12.432 --> 01:51:15.368
NOW SIX YEARS- IT TOOK TWO

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:17.937
YEARS. AGO TWO YEARS THAT OF

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:20.006
THOSE TWELVE YEARS SO THAT THAT

01:51:20.073 --> 01:51:20.573
THAT'S THAT'S THE DIFFICULT

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.208
PART BECAUSE WHAT'S TO SAY

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:24.978
YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK IN L.

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:26.246
LYING YEARS FOR ADDITIONAL

01:51:26.312 --> 01:51:30.717
FUNDS BEFORE YOU REACH TWENTY

01:51:30.784 --> 01:51:31.785
THIRTY. THE WHERE YOU'RE GOING

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:32.852
RIGHT NOW THE MODEL THAT CAN.

01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:35.889
PARDON I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN

01:51:35.955 --> 01:51:36.990
IT I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:38.625
THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE A

01:51:38.691 --> 01:51:41.027
MODEL THAT WE CAN- COMPARE

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:43.296
OURSELVES TO IS THE CALIFORNIA

01:51:43.363 --> 01:51:45.832
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM- WHICH

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:48.134
TOOK- SEVEN YEARS AFTER

01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:51.371
BEGINNING BEFORE- IT REPAID ITS

01:51:51.438 --> 01:51:52.672
LOANS THERE ARE SOME MAJOR

01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:54.874
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:58.111
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- ESPECIALLY

01:51:58.178 --> 01:51:59.479
HOURS GIVEN THE ELIGIBILITY

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:01.247
REQUIREMENTS ARE DIFFERENT AND

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:03.083
THEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:05.218
RESOURCES THAT ARE HELD IN

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:06.286
THESE ACCOUNTS ARE SLIGHTLY

01:52:06.352 --> 01:52:09.122
DIFFERENT- BUT THEY ARE SIMILAR

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:11.257
TO COMPARE- THAT THEY DID

01:52:11.324 --> 01:52:13.393
EVENTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.328
OF SELF SUSTAINABILITY. BUT BUT

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:16.763
ON THEIR PRODUCT THEY REPAID

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:19.232
THE LOANS YOU'RE ASKING FOR

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:22.669
GENERAL FUND MONEY TODAY WHICH

01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:24.003
WILL NOT BE REPAID. SO THERE'S

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:26.039
A STRICTLY JEFF FROM FOR LOANS

01:52:26.106 --> 01:52:27.340
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A MIXTURE

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:28.308
BECAUSE GOING FOR THE CELLS

01:52:28.374 --> 01:52:30.043
LIKE IT WILL BE GENERAL FUND

01:52:30.110 --> 01:52:32.011
LOANS. THIS IS THE GENERAL FUND

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:37.851
MONEY. CORRECT AND THAT'S%

01:52:37.917 --> 01:52:39.686
BUT ONE OF THE- LARGEST

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:41.387
ELEMENTS IN THE LOANS THAT

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:42.522
WE'VE TAKEN WITH THE START UP

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:45.825
COSTS- AND SO- THE GENERAL FUND

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:46.593
APPROPRIATION WILL BE

01:52:46.659 --> 01:52:48.828
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN. WHAT

01:52:48.895 --> 01:52:50.163
IT ACTUALLY COSTS TO GET THE

01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:51.531
PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING. OKAY

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:52.899
I'LL ACCEPT A SUPPORT THE

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:54.734
PROGRAM LASSEN GRAVE CONCERNS.

01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:57.704
ABOUT YOU KNOW SUSTAINABILITY

01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:58.238

SURE IN THE CONCERN WITH THE

01:53:04.377 --> 01:53:04.944
CURRENT MODEL THE WAY THAT IT'S

01:53:05.011 --> 01:53:07.247
SET UP BUT- THE FACT THAT WERE

01:53:07.313 --> 01:53:08.381
WORRIED OVER FIVE MILLION

01:53:08.448 --> 01:53:11.251
DOLLARS FOR SUCH A- POWERFUL

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:14.721
RETURN I THINK IS- SAD I MEAN.

01:53:14.787 --> 01:53:16.489
IN ALL HONESTY FIVE MILLION

01:53:16.556 --> 01:53:18.658
DOLLARS AND MOST THESE ISSUES

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:19.726
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A

01:53:19.792 --> 01:53:22.762
VERY SMALL NUMBER. AND WHAT WE

01:53:22.829 --> 01:53:24.330
GET IN RETURN FOR THAT FIVE

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:25.298
MILLION DOLLARS WE NEED TO FIND

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:27.567
A DIFFERENT WAY. TO FIND YOUR

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:29.903
PROGRAM IS MY OPINION SIR. AND

GENERAL FUND LOAN WAS FIRST USE

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:51.024
THAN WHY NOT A GENERAL FUND

01:53:51.090 --> 01:53:52.659
APPROPRIATION TO ADDRESS SOME

01:53:52.725 --> 01:53:55.228
OF THE CONCERNS. THAT HAVE BEEN

01:53:55.295 --> 01:53:58.131
RAISED TODAY WITH THE PROGRAM.

01:53:58.198 --> 01:54:00.700
THAT THAT DOES- PREDATES ME

01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:04.938
SLIGHTLY- BUT I CAN OFFER- BACK

01:54:05.004 --> 01:54:07.307
TALLIED BOWL WAS STRUCTURED

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:10.510
VERY SIMILARLY TO- THE

01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:12.145
PREVIOUS- COLLEGE SAVINGS

01:54:12.212 --> 01:54:14.547
PROGRAMS THAT I'VE MENTIONED-

01:54:14.614 --> 01:54:17.183

EXPECTATION THAT THIS PROGRAM

01:54:21.788 --> 01:54:23.856
WILL RESELL SUSTAINABILITY AND

01:54:23.923 --> 01:54:26.993
BE ABLE TO HAVE- EXCESS IN

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.695
REVENUE THAT CAN REPAY THOSE

01:54:28.761 --> 01:54:31.698
LOANS. AND SO THE ABILITY FOR

01:54:31.764 --> 01:54:48.147
IT TO- TO STAND ON ITS OWN WAS.

01:54:48.214 --> 01:54:48.781
WAS PRIMARILY DRIVING FORCE. I

FIRST ON THE COST OF THE

01:59:31.464 --> 01:59:33.399
MEASURE WALL THE PROPOSAL WOULD

01:59:33.466 --> 01:59:35.968

ACTUAL FISCAL COSTS QUITE A BIT

01:59:41.541 --> 01:59:42.108
LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION FOR

01:59:42.174 --> 01:59:44.010
A COUPLE REASONS- ONE IS

01:59:44.076 --> 01:59:46.779
HISTORICALLY- ORTIZ AND NOT

01:59:46.846 --> 01:59:48.581

01:59:51.684 --> 01:59:53.486
OVERLAP BETWEEN THIS PROGRAM

01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:55.221

MANUFACTURERS- AND FOR THOSE

02:00:02.528 --> 02:00:04.196
TWO REASONS THE ACTUAL COST OF

02:00:04.263 --> 02:00:06.065
THIS PROGRAM IS CLOSER TO

02:00:06.132 --> 02:00:08.267
THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

02:00:08.334 --> 02:00:10.369
SPREAD OVER FIVE YEARS ONLY

02:00:10.436 --> 02:00:12.071
ABOUT SIX MILLION OF THAT IS

02:00:12.138 --> 02:00:14.006
ACTUAL GENERAL SPEED GENERAL

02:00:14.073 --> 02:00:16.776
FUND COSTS OF THE REMAINING-

02:00:16.842 --> 02:00:18.544
THIRTY TWO MILLION WOULD BE A

02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:21.447
REDUCTION IN LOCAL SALES TAX

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:25.017
RETURNS. ARE ADDITIONALLY- IN

02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:26.686
GENERAL WE WOULD SUGGEST THE

02:00:26.752 --> 02:00:28.120
LEGISLATURE AND PROVIDING

02:00:28.187 --> 02:00:29.055
BUSINESS ASSISTANCE AT THIS

02:00:29.121 --> 02:00:31.090
POINT IN THE STATE'S ECONOMIC

02:00:31.157 --> 02:00:33.392
RECOVERY- THAT THE ASSISTANT

02:00:33.459 --> 02:00:34.427

02:00:34.493 --> 02:00:36.162
BUSINESSES AND SECTORS THAT

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:38.864
HAVE BEEN- MOST IMPACTED BY THE

02:00:38.931 --> 02:00:40.466
CODEPENDENT MAKE AND ALSO THAT

02:00:40.533 --> 02:00:41.267
THAT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:44.136
PROVIDED IN A TIMELY MANNER-

02:00:44.203 --> 02:00:46.072
OVER CATTLE- WE DON'T FEEL THAT

THIS PROGRAM. IS WELL TARGETED

02:00:48.407 --> 02:00:49.909
AT THE MOST IMPACT BUSINESSES

02:00:49.976 --> 02:00:50.943
AND ALSO THE BENEFITS WOULD

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:54.080
OCCUR GRADUALLY OVER TIME I FOR

02:00:54.146 --> 02:00:56.482
THOSE REASONS AS WELL AS THE

02:00:56.549 --> 02:00:57.083
FACT THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST THE

02:00:57.149 --> 02:01:01.287
LEGISLATURE. WE'LL DISCRETION

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:02.788
HOW TO ALLOCATE LOCAL SALES TAX

02:01:02.855 --> 02:01:03.889
DOLLARS AS OPPOSED TO

02:01:03.956 --> 02:01:04.991
REDIRECTING THEM FOR STATE

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:08.127
PURPOSES- WE RECOMMEND

02:01:08.194 --> 02:01:08.628
REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S

02:01:08.694 --> 02:01:12.398

LUCKY. YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY%

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:18.070
THAT THE COST OF NOT

IMPLEMENTING THIS PROCESS. IS

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:22.041
PRETTY HIGH BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:23.242
INDUSTRIES REPRESENTED HERE

THAT BRING IN A LOT OF INCOME

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:30.783
TO THE STATE IN REVENUES THAT-

02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:32.184
DID MANAGE SEVERAL THESE

02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:33.686
INDUSTRIES COULD MOVE OUTSIDE

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:35.321
OF STATE AND WE WOULD LOSE THE

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:37.123
BENEFIT OF WHAT THEY FOR THIS.

02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:40.526
