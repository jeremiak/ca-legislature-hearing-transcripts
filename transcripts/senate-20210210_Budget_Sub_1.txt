TODAY THANK YOU THE FIRST- APPRECIATE THOSE OF COM THERE REALLY HELPFUL. AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THEY'RE JUST MEMBERS ACROSS THE LEGISLATURE THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE WHOLE ISSUE OF.

WITH NO FURTHER ADO WE ARE GOING TO GO TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE IT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING AND RESEARCH PROPOSALS- AND WE WILL BE JOINED VIA ZOOM BY LIZ MAY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AMY LEE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND ONLY GARNER OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE WILL GO IN THAT ORDER AND WE WILL HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL ALL THREE WERE DONE. SO LET ME WELCOME MY LIST MAY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING KAREN MEMBERS LIST MY WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AUGMENTS ON GOING SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING BY THREE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF EVIDENCE BASED SERVICES. THAT DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE SCHOOL READINESS OF INFANTS TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS WITH A TARGETED FOCUS ON PROVIDING SERVICES AN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS AS PRACTICABLE. THE FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BASED ON A FORMULA THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT'S NUMBER PRESCHOOL CHILDREN WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS AND FUNDS WILL BE RESTRICTED IN NATURE. OF SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT THESE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR INCLUDE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ONE TIME PRORAMS ARE RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS. STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES IDENTIFIED TO THE TATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT INCLUDING INCLUSIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING. WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR PRESCHOOL CHILDREN WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS EXPANSION OF INCLUSIVE PRACTICES AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR PRESCHOOL EDUCATORS ON EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES TO BUILD EDUCATOR CAPACITY TO SERVE PRESCHOOL CHILDREN WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS AND MORE INCLUSIVE SETTINGS. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE TIME FEDERAL ID AS FUNDS FOR A STUDY THAT EXAMINES NON PUBLIC SCHOOL AND AGENCY COSTS AND PLACEMENT. THE STUDY WILL INCLUDE A NATIONAL SCANNING COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS OF OUT OF STATE AND IN STATE PLACEMENTS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND ANALYSIS OF STUDENT OUTCOMES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A WILL MOVE TO AMY LEE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING SENATORS AMY LEE WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THIS MORNING WE WANTED TO SHARE OUR ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE GOVERNOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL PROPOSAL I'M STARTING WITH OUR ASSESSMENTS FIRST WE THINK DEVELOPING A SEPARATE FUNDING PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOR PRESCHOOL FURTHER COMPLICATES HOW THE STATE FUNDS SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOCATE PRESCHOOL FUNDING TO A DIFFERENT SET OF ENTITIES AND USE A DIFFERENT ALLOCATION FORMULA AND HOW THE STATE PROVIDES THE REST OF THE K. TWELVE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING AND WE THINK THIS ADDS UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY TO THE FUNDING SYSTEM. THIS APPROACH COULD ALSO MAKE REGIONAL COORDINATION OF SERVICES THROUGH SELFIES MORE CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY SINCE MANY SMALLER DISTRICTS COORDINATE SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS WITH OTHER DISTRICTS AND- SILVA. SECONDLY BY PROVIDING ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH PRESCHOOLER WITH A DISABILITY THIS PROPOSAL COULD CREATE A NEW FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO OVER IDENTIFY CHILDREN FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION IN OTHER WORDS EACH ADDITIONAL PRESCHOOLER IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION WOULD GENERATE MORE FUNDING. CONCERN OVER OVER A GREAT INDICATION IS WHY THE STATE FUND SPECIAL EDUCATION AS IT CURRENTLY DOES BASED ON OVERALL STUDENT ATTENDANCE RECORD AND COUNTS OF STUDENTS RECEIVING SPECIAL EDUCATION ALTHOUGH THIS PROPOSAL MIGHT ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO CHILDREN AT A YOUNGER AGE. ON THE LEGISLATURE WILL ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER IN THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF CREATING SUCH A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. THIRD GIVEN THAT THE ACTIVITIES FINANCE JUST MENTIONED ARE INCLUDED IN INTENT LANGUAGE AND ACTIVITIES THEMSELVES ARE RATHER BROAD IT'S UNCLEAR HOW DISTRICTS WOULD ULTIMATELY USE THIS FUNDING WITHOUT CLEAR SPENDING RESTRICTIONS OR ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THE FUNDING. AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH ADDITIONAL STATE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE ACTIVITIES SUCH AS INCLUSION AND EARLY INTERVENTION MIGHT BE WARRANTED IN THE FUTURE LASTLY THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T ADDRESS UNDERLYING CHALLENGES. TO INCLUSION OR EARLY INTERVENTION CALIFORNIA LIVE BEHIND IN. PRESCHOOL CAN TO OTHERS. WE SPOKE TO PRESCHOOL AS SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THE MATCHING CHALLENGES FINDING INCLUSIVE SETTINGS IN PROGRAMS SUCH AS FEDERAL HEAD START OR CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. THIS WAS LARGELY DUE TO PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAKE COMEDY EATING A CHILD WITH DISABILITIES MORE CHALLENGING PROGRAM STAFF ME ALSO IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO WORK WITH A CHILD WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. FOR EARLY INTERVENTION DISTRICTS MAY FACE CHALLENGES FINDING AND IDENTIFYING PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ESPECIALLY IF THEY DO NOT ALREADY ATTEND A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE EXPANDS THE EXISTING BASED FORMULA TO INCLUDE PRESCHOOL THIS APPROACH WOULD ALLOW TO SEE TO RECOGNIZE LOCAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SERVING THIS AGE GROUP WHILE AVOIDING SOME OF THESE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES INTRODUCED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PRESCHOOL PROPOSAL. BECAUSE PRESCHOOL ATTENDANCE IS NOT CURRENTLY COLLECTED BY TO SEE WE RECOMMEND DOUBLE COUNTING KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE AS A PROXY FOR PRESCHOOL ATTENDANCE. ESTIMATE THAT THIS APPROACH WOULD COST AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR IT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FREEING UP FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WITH THE REMAINING FUNDING RE RECOMMENDS THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER OTHER MORE TARGETED APPROACHES TO PROMOTING INCLUSION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. FOR INSTANCE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER EXPANDING EXISTING INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON INCLUSION OR SUPPORT COORDINATED EFFORTS FOR EARLY INTERVENTION AND EARLY IDENTIFICATION. BUT I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BUT I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT NOW WILL MOVE TO PUBLIC GARNER OF THE- STATE. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WELCOME. THE MORNING THANK YOU ARE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE'S. PUBLIC AND- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION APPRECIATE THE RESTORATION OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION EARLY INTERVENTION GRANT FUNDS. AND KNOWLEDGE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY INTERVENTION AND CREATED CLIPS OF SUPPORTIVE HIGH QUALITY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS. REGARDING THE STUDY TO EXAMINE NON PUBLIC SCHOOL SPECIAL EDUCATION PLACEMENTS THE CITY WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO CLARIFY THE EXPECTATIONS AROUND THE DESIRED OUTCOMES OF THE STUDY. AND REPORT TO ENSURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ACHIEVE THEIR DESIRED OBJECTIVES. WITH ME I HAVE SERRA NETTLEMORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL BRANCH AT CD AND HEATHER CALUMNIES THE SPECIAL EDUCATION DIVISION DIRECTOR THE ANSWER ANY PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. IN TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ON THE L. A. O.'S PROPOSAL I'D LIKE TO HAND IT TO HEATHER. GREAT THANK YOU WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. HI THERE THIS IS HEATHER CALUMNIES THE- STATE DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR C. D. E. IN REGARDS TO THE PROPOSAL AND THE- CHAU EDUCATION- DEPARTMENT AND CD- APPRECIATES THE- THE MINISTRATION- RESTORING THE FUNDING FOR THE EARLY INTERVENTION GRANT- AND IT REALLY IT KNOWLEDGE AND IMPORTANCE OF. EARLY INTERVENTION AND CREATING INCLUSIVE SUPPORT HIGH QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS- AS AS PROPOSED- THE FUNDING IS UNRESTRICTED- AND THAT MAY BE USED TO PROVIDE I THINK CRITICAL. KIND OF CONTINUITY OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN AS WELL AS CHILDREN AT RISK AND I THINK THAT'S- YOU KNOW AN IMPORTANT NOTE TO UNDERSCORE JUST IN TERMS OF- WE KNOW THAT. EARLY INTERVENTION AND EARLY DEDICATION IS CRITICAL- FOR SUPPORTING EARLY LEARNERS EARLY LEARNERS WITH DISABILITIES- JUST A FEW POINTS TO NOTE- IN REGARDING- THE- IN TERMS OF JUST THE EXISTING BASE. FORMULA JUST A SORT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN TERMS OF REALLY- THAT THAT'S THE FUNDING THROUGH THE EXISTING SPECIAL EDUCATION BASED MAY DILUTE THE PROGRAMMATIC AND POLICY PRIORITIES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- REALLY SO IN IT OTHER WORDS ROLLING THIS FUNDING INTO THE BASE COULD COULD BE USED FOR ANY SORT OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PURPOSE AND NOT SPECIFICALLY FOR PRESCHOOL SO- THAT THAT WOULD. NOT BE A COMPLICATING FACTOR BUT IT JUST WOULD BE AN EXTRA CONSIDERATION FOR ELLIE AS AND AN ACCOUNTING AND TRACKING PURPOSES AS WELL IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THOSE DOLLARS YOU GET TO PRESCHOOL STUDENTS AS WELL- AND THEN IT DEFINITELY THESE FUNDS WOULD. THEN BE LIMITED ONLY SERVING THOSE PRE SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND AGAIN- SORT OF FURTHER RESTRICTING- THE- ACCESSING THE POTENTIAL FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO THAT ARE AT RISK IDENTIFIED AT RISK FROM RECEIVING THOSE FUNDS. I THINK ONE OTHER SALIENT POINT TWO TWO UNDERSCORES WHILE IS THAT- YOU KNOW THE- MODIFYING THE BASE TO DOUBLE COUNT KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE- FOR PART FOR PROVIDING PRESCHOOL FUNDING WOULD RESULT IN CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVING THE FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE- CHARTERS DO NOT SERVE PRESCHOOL AGE STUDENTS. AND FUNDING WAS ALLOCATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PRESCHOOL AGE OF THE DISABILITIES AND SO CHARTERS DID NOT RECEIVE THAT FUNDING IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. HOWEVER MODIFYING THE BASE. FORMULA ARE CURRENTLY- OR AS PROPOSED. IN USING KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE THE PROXY WOULD RESULT IN CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVING A PORTION OF THE FUNDS THIS YEAR AND SO ESSENTIALLY THAT WOULD YOU KNOW INCREASE THE NUMBER VALLEY AS AND THEREFORE- THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS RECEIVED BY BY EACH OTHER. IT WOULD BE IMPACTED AS WELL. THANK YOU DOES A COMPLETE THE TESTIMONY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IT DOES THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU. ARMEN OF OPEN WITH QUESTIONS AND I THINK I HAVE TO JUST START ASKING EVERYBODY ABOUT WHAT THEY JUST SAID. BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME. ISSUES BETWEEN PEOPLE AND- LET ME START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ASK. HOW YOU WOULD RESPOND TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE- DIFFERENT WAYS SPENDING PRESCHOOL AND THE UNRESTRICTED FUNDS. R. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST SAID. BLISS MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT OUR INTENTION WAS TO RESTRICT THESE FUNDS FOR- THESE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES NOT ONLY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS BUT ALSO FOR- STUDENTS DOT AND A SCHOOL DISTRICT MIGHT- THE SITE IS AT RISK- AND BASICALLY THIS THE GOAL OF THIS FUNDING IS ALTERNATELY EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION. SO I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH THAT- SECONDLY IT LIKE HEATHER COLONIES HAD MENTIONED- IF THE FUNDS ARE PUT INTO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION BASE THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PRESCHOOL SERVICES. AND NOTHING CURRENTLY A STOPPING A SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM CONTRACTING WITH A SOFA OR ANY OTHER REGIONAL CONSORTIA TO PROVIDE PROGRAMMING FOR THEIR PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. AND. IN THE TOWN I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS THEN LET ME ASK ONE OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE THAT RESPONSE DAILYO. BUT THE- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION INDICATED THAT CHANGING THE FORMULA EXPANDS IT. TO DOUBLE COUNTED AND MOVE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THEN IN A DE FACTO WAY BECAUSE YOU'RE SPREADING IT IN A MORE BROADWAY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD GO TO INDIVIDUAL L. A. H. FOR THIS PURPOSE HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT CONCERN. AND THAT IS ALSO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF IF THIS WERE TO GO THROUGH THE BASE- WHAT DOUBLE COUNTED CANDOR KINDERGARTEN EDA. AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS I HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CHILD FIND AND SERVING PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN NOT CHARTER SCHOOLS SO. AND THAT IS A FOUNDED CONCERNED. IF IT'S A FOUNDED CONCERNED DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO ADDRESS IT SOMETIME HOPEFULLY BEFORE THE MAY REVISE. AT AS OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL STANDS THE- THE FUNDING WOULD ONLY GO TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE SERVING PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. EVEN IF THE USERS ARE YOURS HE SAID IT WAS UNFOUNDED CONCERN BUT THEN YOU JUST SORT OF SAID IT WASN'T TRUE- WHERE ARE WE HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT SORRY ABOUT DOUBLE COUNTING AND BRING IN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN. SO THAT THE CONCERN IS ABOUT THE ELLIOTT THE L. A. IS PROPOSAL TO DOUBLE COUNT KINDERGARTENERS- THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS. AN ALLOCATION BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PRESCHOOL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SERVING AND SO ONLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS SO WHICH- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WAS ACTUALLY SPEAKING TO THE L. A. O.'S PROPOSAL WHEN THEY SAID THAT NOT. YOURS CORRECT OKAY. THEN BOB LET ME GIVE THE L. A. O. WITH CHANCE TO RESPOND TO WHAT THE OTHER TWO ENTITIES SAID ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATION- WHY DO YOU THINK THAT. THEIR CONCERNS ARE EITHER OF CONCERN OR NOT OF CONCERN- I THINK WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM BALLOTS AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I WOULD JUST SEE IN TERMS OF POTENTIALLY DILUTING- SAID THEIR POLICY OBJECTIVES UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL VERSUS THE ALLEY ELSE PROPOSAL WHICH IS JUST TO AUGMENT THE BASED INCLUDE PRESCHOOLERS. I THINK I MEAN UNDERLYING- OPEN QUESTION IS REALLY HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THOSE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO BE USED I THINK IT'S UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THOSE PLANS ARE ON RESTRICTED WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE RESTRICTED I THINK BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT AND IS THROUGH INTENT LANGUAGE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW DISTRICTS WILL FOLLOW. HOW CLOSELY THEY WILL FOLLOW TO THE INTENT TO UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT'S STILL VERY MUCH FROM OUR INTERPRETATION IT'S THEIR VERY MUCH POSSIBLE THAT DISTRICTS COULD USE THIS FUNDING TO FIND EXISTING PRESCHOOL SERVICES- OUR INTERPRETATION IS THAT THAT IS ALLOWED UNDER HELD A PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY WRITING BECAUSE IT IS MAINLY THROUGH INTENT LANGUAGE. AND SO WE THINK THAT THOSE CONCERNS CAN IT KIND OF STILL APPLY IN THAT SENSE IN TERMS OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL ASPECT I THINK THERE ARE DEFINITELY WAYS FOR US TO NOT DOUBLE COUNT KINDERGARTEN FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS AND I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW BIG OF A CHALLENGE IT WOULD BE FOR SEAT BUT IN TERMSOF- JUST ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE RECOGNIZING THAT TERM SCHOOLS DO NOT SERVE THIS. AGE GROUP WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN- CONSIDER IN TERMS OF WHAT THE FINAL DETAILS OF A FOLLOWING A RECOMMENDATION TO LOOK LIKE AND THEN I WOULD JUST SAY IT MORE GENERALLY- I THINK THE REASON WHY WE WOULD PREFER AN APPROACH SHOULD EXPAND THE BEAST IS JUST THAT IT WOULD STREAMLINE HOW THE STATE PROVIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. AND THEN IT WAS ADDITIONAL FUNDS THIS THE LEGISLATURE COULD LOOK AT MORE TARGETED LEADS TO PROMOTE THESE POLICY OBJECTIVES SUCH AS INCLUSION AND EARLY INTERVENTION WE THINK PROVIDING IT IN A YEAR- IN THE PRESCHOOL GRANTS SUCH AS THE ONE PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WE THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY MIGHT ALSO BE LOST IN IN THE WAY THAT THAT FUNDING IS ALLOCATED AS WELL. THERE'S NO REPORTING THAT WHAT WE WOULD REQUIRE FROM DISTRICTS MONEY SPEND THIS FINDING AND BECAUSE OF THAT RATHER VIEWS NATURE. OF THIS INTENT LANGUAGE IT'S NOT ENTIRELY UNCLEAR IT'S NOT. CLEAR WHAT THE- OBJECT. OF FUNDING ACTUALLY. THANK YOU. AND I THINK I COULD KEEP GOING FOREVER WITH EVERYONE BUT LET ME IN A LAST CALL THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO WHAT BOTH THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE L. A. O. JUST SAID. THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK THAT WE WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT OUR POLICY CONCERNS ARE NOT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT ACTUALLY OF THE L. A. O.'S PROPOSAL AND WE WOULD ALIGN OURSELVES MORE CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS AS HEATHER OUTLINED. IN HER COMMENTS. THANK YOU THEN. I'M GONNA SEE OTHER. MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS BUT LET ME JUST MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT WHICH IS. IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S STILL SOME WORK TO DO IT AT LEAST UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE. EVEN IF OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY THINK THE IMPACTS ARE BUT SO I JUST HOPE YOU'LL USE THE TIME. BETWEEN NOW AND WALKING DOWN THE MAY REVISED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S CLEAR. THAT I'M TOTALLY FINE IF YOU DISAGREE ON THE SUBSTANCE AND WE CAN SORT OF. FIGUREOUT WHAT WE THINK ON THAT TOO BUT IT BE NICE IF THERE WAS SOME AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT THE INTERPRETATION REALLY MEANS SO THAT. WE CAN DECIDE WHAT IT IS THAT. WE WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THOSE ITEMS SO LET ME ASK YOU EITHER. SENATOR MEN RITUAL BOGUS YOU HAVE QUESTIONS GIVE US CENTRO TROUBLED. THE MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION THIS MORNING- AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FORMULAS OF HOW TO FIND. THE SPECIAL NEEDS AND THE CONCERNS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. AS HAVING THE FUNDS BEING RESTRICTED OR UNRESTRICTED- AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A SOME SORT OF LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS. IF UNRESTRICTED. ARE SET ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION- SO IF WE COULD SEE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT IN MAKING SURE THAT IT DOES REALLY TRULY GO TO SPECIAL EDUCATION THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL- I DO HAVE A QUESTION- DEGENERES FIRST THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND TWENTY BUDGET ACT WHICH- PROVIDED. FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO. POINT SEVEN MILLION TO CREATE THE EARLY INTERVENTION PRESCHOOL GRANT PROGRAMS. THIS PROGRAM AWARDS FUNDS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS. WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS AND PROVIDES NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS- APPROXIMATELY IN FUNDING PER CHILD. THE FUNDING IS ALSO UNRESTRICTED WHICH FEEDS UP FUNDS FOR OTHER DISTRICT NEEDS. KEEPING IN MIND MY QUESTION IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE- IF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. EARLY NUMBER CHEN GRANTS WERE TO ALIGN WITH THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FORMULA. FOR AWARDS DO YOU KNOW THE INCREASE IN PER PUPIL FUNDING THE DOLLARS WOULD PROVIDE FOR EXAMPLE. WITH THE FUNDING INCREASED BY A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SE PER PUPIL. I'M SORRY IT MEMBER COULD YOU REPHRASE THAT I DON'T THINK I QUITE UNDERSTOOD. SO BASICALLY IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TO FUNDING FORMULAS RIGHT NOW WOOD WHICH ONE WOULD CREATE A BETTER FUNDING THAT NUMBER- MORE. IT WAS A LUCRATIVE BUT A BETTER FUNDING NUMBER FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR FOR THE ENTITIES THAT ARE PRESENTING ARE USING THESE FUNDS RECEIVING THESE FUNDS. ARE ARE YOU REFERENCING THE ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN- THE GRANT PROGRAM VERSUS THE LA IS- PROPOSAL. THE ONE THAT YOU ARE RIGHT NOW SO YOU'RE COMPARING THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT THAT PROVIDED FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION TO CREATE THE EARLY INTERVENTION PRESCHOOL GRANT PROGRAMS. THAT IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW I'M FOR PROPOSED WHAT WHICH ONE WOULD ACTUALLY CREATE A BETTER FUNDING NUMBER FOUR AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. L. A. C. THANK YOU SENATE THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SAME GRANT PROGRAM AND I WILL PASS THIS OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE. AMBER ALEXANDER. THANK YOU SENATOR- AMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS MY COLLEAGUE LIZ WAS MENTIONING THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE VERY SIMILAR THE DIFFERENCE THIS YEAR IS THAT THERE'S A LOOK AT THERE'S A MORE TARGETED FOCUSED ON- PRESCHOOLERS- INSTANCE THE DISABILITIES WERE BEING SERVED IN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS. BUT THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY BETWEEN ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN AMOUNT AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THE SAME AND BOTH HAVE THAT FOCUSED ON AND THE PRESCHOOL CAMPS. SO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING WOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT FORMAT OR FORMULA FOR FUNDING. THE FORMULA ITSELF IS THE SAME. AMOUNT IS NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME BECAUSE THE TWENTY NINETEEN AMOUNT AS YOU AS YOU SAID IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE MILLION. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS- THREE HUNDRED BILLION SO THERE IS GOING TO BE EIGHT EIGHT DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT'S RECEIVE JUST BECAUSE THERE IS- YOU KNOW LESS LESS MONEY BEING ALLOCATED IN PROPOSAL THIS YEAR- BUT THE- FORMULA ITSELF. IS THE SAME BETWEEN BOTH- BOTH PROGRAMS. OKAY SENATOR IF I MAY. ARE GARNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WE ESTIMATE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED PER PUPIL ON IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE NINE THOUSAND PER PUPIL IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE THE GRANT AMOUNT WAS GREATER SO IT WAS NINE THOUSAND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. AND FOR US THAT WE APPROXIMATE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED IF WE USED THE FORMULA USED THIS YEAR AND THE NUMBERS YET- IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL CURRENTLY. FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED. OKAY. SO MY SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE. THIS QUESTION IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT AWARDS FOR THE SPECIAL EDUCATION EARLY INTERVENTION GRANT PROGRAM. OF THAT INITIAL FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION PROVIDED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWENTY HOW MUCH HAS BEEN AWARDED. AMBER ALEXANDER AGAIN A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- FACT THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO SPEAK TO I KNOW- YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT THE ONLY- MENTIONED ABOUT THAT FUNDING BEING UNRESTRICTED- I DON'T. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT- IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC OUTCOMES THAT WERE REPORTED AND FROM THE DIRECT USE OF THOSE FUNDS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT WAS ALLOCATED BASED ON PRESCHOOL COUNTS FOR. EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES THE FINDING WAS UNRESTRICTED TIMING COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES. WHEN YOU SAY USED FOR. ARE YOU INTENDING TO SAY THAT THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES THAT COULD BE USED OTHER THAN SPECIAL SERVICES. FOR THE FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED IN TWENTY NINETEEN YES AS IT WAS UNRESTRICTED FUNDING OKAY- SO IT WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE USED SPECIFICALLY FOR. EARLY INTERVENTION PRESCHOOL SERVICES IT WAS ALLOCATED- FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT IT WAS UNRESTRICTED SO- LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THAT HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOW BEST TO USE THOSE DOLLARS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. SO IN OTHER WORDS IT'S BEST TO HAVE IT RESTRICTED IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IT GOES TO TOWARDS THE INTENDED SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL. PROGRAM I THINK THAT WOULD THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HERE YOU'RE ASKING I KNOW- IN THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR WE DID TRY TO STRIKE MARC THAT BALANCE BETWEEN. GIVING DISTRICTS SOME FLEXIBILITY BY BUT ALSO GIVING THEM DIRECTION- IN TERMS OF. OF EXCLUDING IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THE FUNDING SHALL BE USED FOR SERVICES. THAT SUPPORT THE SCHOOL READINESS OF- AT PEOPLE'S M. H. YOU KNOW BIRTH TO FIVE WHO ARE CERTAIN INCLUSIVE SETTING SO WE TRIED TO GET. MORE DIRECTION BUT ALSO STRIKING THAT BALANCE BETWEEN- NO NOT TOTALLY RESTRICTING THE FUNDS BUT- IN ALLOWING SOME FLEXIBILITY. OKAY YOUR QUESTION. CENTER MEN AND- SENATOR MEANT. THANK YOU TRAILER TO FIVE THANK YOU FOR THE WITNESSES FOR TESTIFYING I JUST HAD ONE QUESTION. I THINK IS A CLARIFYING QUESTION- AND INTO THIS WOULD BE FOR FINANCE AND EDUCATION- DOES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL EXCLUDE COUNTY OFFICES EDUCATION FOR- APPLYING FOR THESE- SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION GRANTS. I DON'T LOSE MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO AND THE- CORRECT- COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATIONAL NOT RECEIVE THESE FUNDS ONLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WELL BUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN ABSOLUTELY CONTRACT WITH THEIR COUNTY OFFICES OF AT. TO SERVE THEIR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WAS THERE A REASON FOR THAT I KNOW IN ORANGE COUNTY- WE HAVE- OUR OFFICE EDUCATION HAS A PRETTY. OVER AND SPECIAL NEEDS AND SO I GUESS WHAT WAS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT WAS- ONE OF WHO ULTIMATELY HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVING THIS AGE GROUP WHICH IS SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT- MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR COUNTY OFFICES OF ADD TO HELP SERVE THIS POPULATION- I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAYBE THANKS WHETHER I THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO ALLOW COUNTY OFFICES EDUCATION ALSO APPLY FOR THESE FUNDS. I JUST AVOID THE MIDDLE MAN AND SOME OF THAT FRICTIONS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM HAVING TO HAVE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS APPLY FOR THIS. THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU SENATOR MAN THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS OF THAT COMPLETES OUR CONSIDERATION OF ISSUE ONE AND JUST TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT WE WILL DO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF ALL SIX ISSUES. WILL MOVE TO ISSUE TO SPECIAL EDUCATION MEDICAL BILLING. AND AMAZINGLY IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME PANEL SO WE'LL HAVE WAS MINE AMY LEE ELLIE GARNER IN THAT ORDER SO. WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND WE'LL START WITH WAS MORE. EKET LIST MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SELECT TWO OR MORE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO CONVENE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORKS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT WILL SUPPORT. A LIAISE AND SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION IN THE ALLEY EIGHT MEDICAL BILLING OPTION PROGRAM. AND THIS. UGH THESE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WILL HELP IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES IN REGARDS TO THE MEDICAL BILLING AND PROVIDE PEER TO PEER LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD CAPACITY IN THIS AREA. IN ADDITION THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO A SINGLE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY WITH DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS IN SUBMITTING CLAIMS TO THE ALLEY A MEDICAL BILLING OPTION PROGRAM AND OTHER MEDICAL BILLING PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN BUILDING CAPACITY. THIS AGENCY WOULD WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT TO DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES AND RESOURCES AS WELL SERVE AS A POINT OF CONTACT FOR OTHER LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. THIS AGENCY WOULD ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICAL BILLING WORK GROUPS MEET AT WORKGROUP MEETINGS CONVENED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THESE PROPOSALS ADDRESS SOME OF THE PRELIMINARY NEEDS AND TEAMS IDENTIFIED IN THE SB SEVENTY FIVE WORK GROUP INTERIM REPORT. I'M PARTICULARLY THE NEED FOR CAPACITY BUILDING AND TO FILL KNOWLEDGE GAPS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS. THESE PROPOSALS WILL ALSO. PUT IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR ONE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS DO COME OUT. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE WILL MOVE TO EMILY. EMILY WITH L. A. AGAIN THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT DISTRICTS NEED MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATE AND MALEATE MEDICAL BILLING OPTION PROGRAM HOWEVER GIVEN THAT THE MEDIC HELD BILLING- THERE'S A WORK GROUP CURRENTLY EXAMINING THESE ISSUES THAT THEY'LL HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS OUT TO- ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE OUT BY OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. WE THINK THESE PROPOSALS ARE RATHER PREMATURE I'M FOR THE MORE IN THAT GOT IN THE WORK GROUP'S INTERIM REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED THIS PAST OCTOBER THERE WERE HIGHLIGHTS OF POTENTIAL NEED FOR A STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP WHICH YOU WAKE ME BETTER ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT SCHOOLS ARE FACING RATHER THAN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE WE ASSESS THE MEDICAL BILLING PROPOSALS FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROCESS AFTER IT HAS HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW OF THE FINAL. WORKGROUP RECOMMENDATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN REMOVE THE L. A. GARNER FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU IT'S BEEN TOO LONG. SAID THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ELEAZAR ACCESS FEDERAL MEDICAID FUNDS THE S. S. P. I. HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED HOW MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ELEAZAR ARE MISSING OUT ON TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THE REIMBURSEMENT IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE KINDS OF SERVICES ARE CHILDREN SO DESPERATELY NEED. THIS IS AN ISSUE HAS BEEN ONLY MAY ONLY HAVE BEEN MADE MORE APPARENT BY THE PANDEMIC ACCORDING THE DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ONLY FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE ELEAZAR PARTICIPATED IN THE MEDIC HOW BILLING PROGRAM IN FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN A NUMBER THAT HAS INCREASED BY ONLY ONE ALLEY A PER YEAR SINCE FISCAL YEAR TWELVE THIRTEEN. THOSE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE ELEAZAR CLAIMED A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION A DECREASE OF FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION OR ABOUT FISCAL YEAR FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. THESE NUMBERS SHOWED THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR ACTION IN THIS SPACE AND IT IS VERY REAL. THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY ADAM IS JUST ONE PART OF THE ABOVE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS NEEDED SOLUTION I WOULD KNOW THAT ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED AS WELL WHICH INCLUDES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCENTIVIZE MEDICAL MEDIC HOW PLANS TO INVEST IN DELIVERING CRITICAL SERVICES TO STUDENTS. AND WORK THAT THE ASSETS YEAH I HAS DONE TO EXPAND THE NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPERIENCE NECESSARY TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL ALLEY A BILLING BEYOND THE MEDICAL PLANS THEMSELVES THERE ARE ALSO SOME SOME OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS SUCH AS CRITERIA AND ELEAZAR ALEXION PROCESS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO CLARIFY. WE WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT GIVEN THE APPOVAL OF THE AMENDMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAID STATE PLAN LAST YEAR MEDI CAL BILLING TO EXPAND MAYBE EXPANDED TO PEOPLES THAT DO NOT HAVE AN I EP THERE FOR OPENING UP THE PROGRAM FOR MORE SERVICES THAN. JUST THOSE THAT FALL UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF SPECIAL EDUCATION WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION ON HOW TO BEST FIT ALL OF THESE PIECES TOGETHER SO THAT OUR CHILDREN GET THE SERVICES THEY THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED WHILE ENSURING OUR SCHOOLS AREN'T BREAKING. THE BANK IN THE PROCESS I HAVE WITH ME AGAIN SERRA NOVEL. DEPUTIES YOU. OF OPPORTUNE FOR ALL BRANCHES CDT ANSWER ANY PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS. CONCLUDES OUR REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH A QUESTION FOR THE L. A. O. ANDTHEN PASS FINANCES AND- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO RESPOND. AND THE- THE L. A. O. SAID THAT. THERE IS ATASK FORCE COMING IT'S GONNA REPORT IN OCTOBER. AND SUGGESTED THAT WE NOT DEAL WITH THIS BUDGET HERE WITH THIS ISSUE. AND I WAS GOING TO ASK IF THERE IS THE L. A. O. AND THEN ASKED FINANCE AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION COMMENT. DO YOUTHINK THERE ARE THINGS ON WHICH THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY COMMON AGREEMENT THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY AND NOT WAIT. UNTIL OF THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND. SENATOR I THINK THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION- AND I THINK I'M I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT I HAVE A CLEAR SENSE AS TO WHAT THE CONSENSUS PROBLEM AREAS ARE I THINK THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. FOR DISTRICTS IT I THINK IT REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO WHO AND WHAT AND SEES WOULD BE BEST SERVED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHETHER OR NOT THAT SHOULD BE STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE. SERVICES OR IF WE SHOULD BE USING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH WHICH IS TO IDENTIFY ELEAZAR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ALREADY DOING MASS. SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AND PERSONALLY I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE THEN LET ME ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF YOU WOULD RESPOND. TO THAT COMMENT AND NOT CONCERNED AND AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S CONCERNED THAT THEY STILL NEED CLARIFICATION ON SOME THINGS. RIGHT LIST MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO CLARIFY. ON THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE JUST STILL IN CONVERSATIONS BUT HAPPY TO COLLABORATE- IN TERMS OF- EARLY ACTIONS AND THAT COULD BE TAKEN IN THIS BUDGET YEAR TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE FIELD FOR IT FOR YEARS NOW. THIS NEED FOR MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MORE. WE'RE COULD POSSIBLY BUILDING AND- THIS NEED TO FILL IN THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP THAT EXISTS OUT IN THE FIELD- AND THIS IS TRUE REGARDLESS OF WHAT AND- WHAT REFORMS MIGHT. OCCUR WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS. MIGHT COME OUT IN OCTOBER AND SO WE ARE CURRENTLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR HHS COUNTERPARTS WITHIN FINANCE ABOUT- AS ABOUT ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN OR WILL BE TAKEN- BUT-WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE REAL- SOMETIMES THE- RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN- THE STATE AGENCIES AND LOCALS CAN BE A LITTLE STRANGE WHICH IS WHY THIS PROPOSAL- DOES FOCUS. ON LOCAL CAPACITY BUILDING FROM LOCALS AND PEER TO PEER LEARNING- WE ALSO WOULD JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO BUILD THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING WHEN RECOMMENDATIONS TO COME OUT IN OCTOBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN LET ME GO TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND FINANCE JUST SAID THEY WOULD WORK WITH YOU ON THE CLARIFICATIONS OF THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE. AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAD ANY COMMENT ON WHAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE THIS YEAR BEFORE THE- TASK FORCE MARK REPORT. LATELY AND THANK YOU SENATOR A COUPLE NOTES FIRST OF ALL AT AT CDC WE ARE. HELPING CO LEAD THIS SB SEVENTY FIVE WORK GROUP AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING. THAT WILL COME OUT THIS NEXT OCTOBER WILL BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN ALREADY WORKING ON WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS. AT DH CS AND THE STAKEHOLDERS I WOULD ALSO NOTE. THAT AS PART OF THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR WERE ALLOWED TO RETROACTIVELY BILL FOR FIVE YEARS- AND THAT IMPACTS THE TIMING PEACE. IN OUR ESTIMATION ELEAZAR CAN RETROACTIVELY BILL FOR FIVE YEARS BUT THAT CLOCK IS ALREADY TICKING. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DOES NEED TO HAPPEN NOW AND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE DOES NEED TO BE BUILT UP CURRENTLY. SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE OUT ON THAT RETROACTIVE BILLING OPPORTUNITY FOR ELEAZAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH REMIGES SIR PRITCHETT THE RESPONSE TO THE-QUESTIONS FOR ME TO REVIEW AND- IT SEEMS CLEAR LIKE THEY'RE- THEY'RE- LIKELY MIGHT. BE SOME PLACES TO STILL GO. IN THIS THIS JUNE. ABSALOM ME ASK IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SENATOR MAN. OKAY WE'RE GOOD SO LET ME THANK THAT PANEL- WE REALLY APPRECIATE.

A. AND TELLING CORDNER GARDNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WILL GO IN THAT ORDER- BEGIN WITH FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THE MORNING CARE ACT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALL FINISH YOUR TIME WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT SCHOOLS ARE CRITICAL POINT OF ACCESS FOR PREVENTATIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. CULINARY DATA ALSO SUGGESTS THAT DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY INCREASED AND CHILDREN DURING THE PANDEMIC. SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND PROMOTE WELLNESS IN SCHOOLS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES SEVERAL INITIATIVES AIMED TO INCREASE RESOURCES AND COORDINATE EFFORTS TO SUPPORT CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR TODAY'S HEARING I WILL GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE TWENTY FIVE MILLION GOING EIGHT. TWENTY FIVE MILLION I'M GOING TO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MATCHING FUNDS FOR CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IT WAS ALSO TWENTY MENTAL. THANKS THE SCOPE OF SERVICES AVAILABLE IN SCHOOL SETTINGS AND LEVERAGING RESOURCES TO STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ELEAZAR COUNTY. THIS FUNDING IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS A CATER TWELVE STUDENTS IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH A WHOLE CHILD APPROACH TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR SUPPORT NETWORKS SUPPORT FOR FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS THEY'LL PROVIDE A ONE DOLLAR NINETY EIGHT MATCH FOR EVERYONE DOLLAR BINDING AND COUNTIES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. YOUR SPENDING PLAN THAT IS DEDICATED TO A PROJECT THAT SUPPORTS CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS. AT LEAST WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FUNDING AND WORK WITH THEIR COUNTY PARTNERS ON A PROPOSAL TO EXPAND OF CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH PROJECTS WITHIN THE COUNTY THREE YEARS SPENDING PLAN TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES IN SCHOOL SETTINGS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TWO ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH PROPOSALS. THE FIRST IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FUNDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES ACT ANY OTHER STATE PARTNERSHIP BRANDS OF THE PORT THE EXISTING PROGRAM. IS PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SCHOOLS AND ADDRESSING SUICIDE AND DROPOUT PREVENTION SERVICES. OUTREACH TO HIGH RISK HIGH RISK YOU. UNDERSTAND OTHER STRATEGIES ARE RESPONSIBLE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS. THE PROPOSAL IS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS RECEIVING PREVENTATIVE EARLY INTERVENTION AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES MY SCHOOL AFFILIATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. THE TWO LATTER PROPOSALS WILL BE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL DURING THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THANK YOU GOODBYE REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. REMOVE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. ANYWAY WHAT THE L. A. L. AGAIN SO WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THAT PROPOSAL AND WILL BE PUBLISHING OUR ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IN THE MEANTIME YOU WANTED TO SHARE OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE TWENTY FIVE MILLION ON GOING. OUT NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO MATCH COUNTY SPENDING ON THESE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH PROJECTS. GENERALLY GIVEN THE CONCERNS OVER ST MENTAL HEALTH WE THINK PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING TO INCREASE WILL BE SERVICES IS REASONABLE HOWEVER WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FIRST AND FOREMOST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LARGELY OVERLAPS AND DUPLICATES EITHER A SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH BUDGET PROPOSALSCURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. FOR INSTANCE AS FINANCE MENTIONED IN THIS BUDGET THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO AUGMENT A SEPARATE EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS. THESE EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS AND THE MATCHING FUNDS SHARE MANY SIMILARITIES BOTH ARE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS TARGETED TO COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS TO INCREASE SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE MOST NOTABLE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE MATCHING FUNDS ARE ADMINISTERED BY CD EACH SCHOOLS RATHER THAN THROUGH A STATE COMMSSION TO COUNTIES AS IS THE CASE WITH EXISTING PARTNERSHIP GRANTS. HOW THESE PROPOSALS ARE INTENDED TO BE CORONATED IS STILL UNCLEAR ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MATCHING FUNDS PROPOSAL COULD ALLOW DISTRICTS TO RECEIVE GRANTS FROM BOTH PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOCUSED ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE MATCHING FUNDS THESE ACTIVITIES COULD ALSO BE FUNDED UNDER OTHER PENDING PROPOSALS AS WELL. SECONDLY WE ARE ALSO UNCERTAIN IF THE MATCHING FUNDS WOULD ULTIMATELY INCREASE COUNTY SPENDING ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH AS INTENDED. THE STATE DOESN'T COLLECT DATA ON COUNTY SPENDING ON CHILDREN'S SERVICES MEANING IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHETHER THE PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOULD MATCH NEW COUNTY SPENDING OR WOULD MATCH EXISTING FUNDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEDICATED TO THE SERVICE SAYS. LASTLY I THINK WE HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE LIKELY IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL. LARGELY DUE TO THE LACK OF A LOT AVAILABLE TO. ARE STATING IS THAT MY OF THESE DO. WILL LEFT UP TO. AND THEY- DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD TO DECIDE. AND AS A RESULT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THESE APPLICATIONS WOULD BE PRIORITIZED AND WHAT THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE. THAT CONCLUDES OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENTS AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE WILL BE RECESSED ARE RELEASING UR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE COMING DAYS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IN THE MEAN TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW MOVED ONLY GARNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU SENATOR ALEXANDER ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THE SS PI HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED HOW THIS PANDEMIC HAS PRESENTED MANY CHALLENGES TO STUDENTS EDUCATORS AND PARENTS. STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY COPING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO THE CHANGES IN THEIR LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BROUGHT ON BY THE SWITCH TO DISTANCE LEARNING. HEALTH WILL BE CRITICAL MOVING FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE SEVERE TRAUMA OUR STUDENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED DURING THIS CRISIS. AND THOSE THOSE TRAUMAS CAN HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN AND SUCCEED. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR COMPETITIVE INCENTIVE GRANTS TO MATCH PROPOSED COUNTY EXPENDITURES FOR CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF INVESTMENT THAT IS NEEDED RIGHT NOW WELL THE AMOUNT MAY BE SMALL WHEN COUPLED WITH OTHER EFFORTS SUCH AS SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S OTHER PROPOSALS AROUND MEDICARE BILLING DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. AND ADDITIONAL EFFORTS BY THE SS PI. THIS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR STUDENTS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THIS CRITICAL NEED. AND AGAIN I HAVE WITH ME SERENATA. AND BARBARA MURCHISON THE DIRECTOR OF THE EDUCATOR EXCELLENCE AND EQUITY DIVISION TO ANSWER ANY PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE FOR CD. THAT CONCLUDES OUR REMARKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A WOMAN BEGIN WITH A FEW QUESTIONS FOR FINANCE. A. M. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT- COLAIO SAID THAT- A PIECE OF THIS DUPLICATES EXISTING- PROGRAMS HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. WELCOME TO SHAKE HANDS APARTMENT FINANCE. SO WHILE THERE IS SOME OVERLAP. E'VE SEEN THE PROPOSAL'S ATTACKING THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES. ARE PROP NINETY EIGHT AND MATCHED PROPOSAL ADDRESSES CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS BY FOCUSING ON PROVIDING SUPPORT NETWORKS IN SCHOOLS. WHILE THE OTHER TWO PROPOSAL SEEMS TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES- ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS MATCH AND ARE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE MATCH WHICH WILL. IN COUNTY SPENT MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS ALL HEALTH ACT LANDS ON SCHOOLS SHALL WE KNOW THAT SOME COUNTIES HAVE A BALANCE IN AN HSA FUNDS AND WE- WE WALK UNTIL TYTUS- THAT TOWARDS CHILDREN. HEALTH SERVICES. FROM THAT RESPONSE TEES UP THE SECOND QUESTION I HAD BECAUSE I WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO ASK JUST HOW FAR YOU THOUGHT THE REACH WAS FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO SERVE AND. IT WAS SAID IN ONE OF THE OTHER- PRESS. THAT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT IS MATCHED. IS IT ALREADY BEING DONE FOR OTHER SERVICES SO. IT IN ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF HOW FAR WOULD TWENTY FIVE MILLION REACH STATEWIDE. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT'S THE MATCH IS ADDITIONAL AS OPPOSED TO JUST SOMETHING THAT'S BEING DONE NOW SO IT'S NOT REALLY EXPANDING THE REACH BY. BY MATCHING WHAT YOU PROPOSE FOR THE STATURE. I'M HI ACT PUBLISHER TENS APARTMENT OF FINANCE SO SIMILAR TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES A STUDENT ACT PARTNERSHIP GRANTS WE HOPE SO- AWARD EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY GRAMS AND WE HOPE TO PRIORITIZE. AND I'LL BE AS YOU OUTSIDE FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES YOU CAN ACT PARTNERSHIP GRANTS BUT IN ROCK DID NOT RECEIVE AN AWARD- AS LONG AS THEY WOULD. BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MATCH. AND SO. TO TWENTY. OF OUT OF HOW MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE I MEAN WHAT ARE WE REACHING OUR WITH EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY GRAMS. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN FRONT OF ME BUT I'M HAPPY EACH YEAR AT AND FIND OUT THE INFORMATION AND AT AND AT BACK TO YOU WITH THIS TOPIC. OUR OFFICE GET BACK GET BACK OKAY BECAUSE IT WOULD WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO TELL US HOW FAR THIS REALLY GOES AND THEN I'M NOT SURE I HEARD. A CLEAR ANSWER ON WHETHER OR NOT THE MATCH- WOULD ALLOW THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING DONE FOR THE MATCH IS REALLY. A REQUIRES A DISTRICT TO DO. NEW THINGS WITH THE MATCHING MONEY. I YES POPULATIONS HEALTH AS PART OF FINANCE- SO OUR- HOPE IS THAT. THE COUNTY IS ALREADY PROVIDING CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES YOU SEEN THAT MHSAA AND- ACTIVISTS PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING WILL GO TO. SCHOOLS AND EXPAND OUR COMPLEMENT. THE EXISTING PROJECTS. WELL NO IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT'S NEW FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT WILL BE AN EXPANSION. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE THERE IT'S BEING MATCHED WITH SOMETHING THAT'S AN EXPANSION OR IT SOUNDS TO ME FROM WHAT YOU JUST SAID. THAT IT'S EXISTING SERVICES SO REQUIRE NO MATCH DOESN'T RELIEVE MY COORDINATE BETTER BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY REQUIRE. ADDITIONAL SERVICES FROM THE MATCH. I'M SORRY CAN YOU. REPEAT YOUR COMMENT PLEASE I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. IF THE MATCHING FUNDS ARE JUST THINGS THAT ARE BEING DONE ALREADY SO IT'S NOT AN ADDITIONAL SERVICE BEING PROVIDED BY THE MATCHING FUNDS OR WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS PREDICATED. ON LIKE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF NEW EXPENDITURES TWENTY FIVE MILLION FROM. THE PROP NINETY EIGHT HERE AND THEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN THE MATCH THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING NEW. IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE YOU'RE ALLOWING THEM TO TAKE EXISTING SERVICES. AND USE THAT AS A MATCH THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY EXPANDING THE REACH OF MIGHT BE BETTER COORDINATION BUT IT'S NOT EXPANDING THE REACH FROM THIS MONEY. I ASKED- THANK YOU I AM GOING TO HAVE A PASS OFF. THAT QUESTIONS MY COLLEAGUE ON THE LISTING. YOU'RE LISTENING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- WE CAN DEFINITELY- CLARIFY THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE'RE REALLY- TARGETING THIS TO LEVERAGE COUNTY THANK YOU HAVE A BALANCE- IN THE MHSAA RESERVES- WE WANT IT REALLY INCENTIVIZE THEM TO PUT MORE DOLLARS ON THE TABLE. AND TO PARTNER WITH AT LEAST RECEIVE THIS MATCH. OKAY THANK YOU. AND THEN ONE LAST QUESTION FOR FINANCE AND NOW. IN THE DISCUSSION OF LOST WHICH PIECE YOU WERE. SPEAKING ABOUT I THINK IT WAS A FOUR MILLION BUT IT WAS ONE TIME. THAT WAS- IN THE SUBJECT AREA MORE WHAT pSUCCESSFUL IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD THEN DECIDE TO CONSIDER FOR ON GOING. OR IS IT REALLY FOR ONE TIME IMPACT. AND THERE'S NO VIEW THAT THIS WOULD. YOU KNOW COME BACK IN FUTURE YEARS. I ASKED HEALTH MINISTER TEN OF THE PARKS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THOSE TWO ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS THAT ARE ONE TIME FANS ARE ATTY BEING. OVERSEEN BY OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY OUR COUNTERPARTS AT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT BANK FINANCE SO- THOSE PROPOSALS ARE AND- BE DISPENSED GOTTEN A SEPARATE I JUST COMMITTEE BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MAX- WE DO PROPOSED ONGOING FRIENDS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SORRY TO. DOMINATE THOSE QUESTIONS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM STE AND OTHER SENATORS. IN SEEING NONE- WHAT WE THANK YOU FOR THAT DISCUSSION. THEN WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE FOR WHICH IS SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS AND WILL HAVE MICHELLE VALDIVIA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EDGAR CABRAL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND HOW WE GARNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL GO IN THAT ORDER AND WILL BEGIN WITH MICHELLE FAULTY VIA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS MICHELLE AND THE BALLOT THAT CRIMINAL FINANCE- SO AS LAID OUT IN THE AGENDA THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TO PROVIDE ENHANCED SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEY RESOURCES- OF THE TEN MILLION A MINIMUM OF FIVE MILLION WILL BE TO CONTRACT WITH A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY. MOST LIKELY A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION- TO THAT APPROPRIATE SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS AND TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND IMPLEMENTATION AND DATA ANALYSIS AND THIS PIECE WE ESPECIALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE WE ENVISION- THE BULK OF THE WORK THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE WILL BE DOING. IS PROVIDING THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES FOR DISTRICTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE AND INTERPRET THE DATA THEY ARE GATHERING FROM THE SURVEYS- THE REMAINING FUNDING OUR MAXIMUM OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE ALLOCATED AS MANY GRANTS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS- TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CITED SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS- WE WANT DISTRICTS TO CONTINUE TO USE THESE TOOLS HAPPENED FOR UNDER CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS SEES. RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETIMES DISTRICTS MAY NEED FURTHER SUPPORT YOU KNOW FOR THE FUNDING TO DO THIS WORK- WE ALSO HOPE THAT FUNDING WILL ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO ADMINISTER CLIMATE SURVEY EVERY YEAR AS OPPOSED TO EVERY OTHER YEAR AS IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED- I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT TO CREATE A NEW CLIMATE SURVEY OR TOOL. BUT RATHER TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE USING RELIABLE CLIMATE SURVEYS I CAN GIVE THEM INSIGHT INTO THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WITH EVERYTHING THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH- AND WITH COMMUNITY AND DISTANCE LEARNING- AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW MORE IMPORTANTLY- THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN GET. RESOURCES TO DO THE COMPLICATED WORK OF THE DISAGGREGATED AND INTERPRETING THAT DATA THAT THEY GATHER FROM THE SURVEYS- TO INFORM THE CONTINUOUS. IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS.% QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE QUEST. AFTER ALL THROUGH. OF YOU WILL GO TO THE L. A. L. YES GOOD MORNING EDGAR CABRAL ECLIPSE THAT AMOUNT OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE WE JUST NOTE THAT IN RETURN YOUR BILL LANGUAGE WE HAVE SOME SIMILAR QUESTIONS TO THOSE ARE RAISING YOUR AGENDA- IN IN TERMS OF ABOUT EIGHT THE PROPOSAL WE THINK.

BEING AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOMS BEING AWAY FROM THEIR CLASSROOMS FRIENDS TEACHERS AND EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES WHILE ADJUSTING TO DISTANCE LEARNINGHAS BEEN A LOT FOR STUDENTS TO DEAL WITH WE MUST DO ALL THAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THEIR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. THIS IS WHY NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED SERVICES TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH WE WOULD NOTE THAT CD E. HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS AND MAY SERVE AS A BETTER ENTITIES TO FACILITATE THIS PROPOSAL WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS PROPOSAL. AND AGAIN I HAVE WITH ME BARBARA JUSTIN THE DIRECTOR OF THE EDUCATOR EQUITY AND EXCELLENCE DIVISION TO CANCER ANY PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU- I JUST HAD ONE QUESTION FOR FINANCE AND IT'S SORT OF IN THE WEEDS- OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CLIMATE HEALTH AND LEARNING SURVEY. AND IT HAS AN ACRONYM. I CAN'T PRONOUNCE CAL.

THANK YOU SENATOR ALEXANDER ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ADMINISTERS AND PROVIDES A SYSTEM OF SUPPORT TO OVER THREE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS SPONSORS THAT OPERATE ONE OF THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OR USTA'S. CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS THE SEVEN FEDERAL CHILD NUTRITION GIVE ME CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM THE SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM THE SPECIAL MILK PROGRAM THE CHILD AND ADULT FOOD PROGRAM. THE USDA FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM SUMMER FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM AND THE SEAMLESS SUMMER OPTION. THESE PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO SAFEGUARD THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN AND TO PROVIDE NUTRITIOUS YEAR ROUND ACCESS TO MEALS. THERE ARE OVER SIX POINT TWO MILLION CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND 59% ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. SCHOOLS IN THEIR FOOD SERVICE STAFF HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF PROVIDING MEALS SINCE THE FIRST DAY O THE NATIONWIDE PANDEMIC. SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY THE USDA HAS ISSUED OVER SEVENTY NATIONWIDE COVE IN NINETEEN PROGRAM REGULATION WAIVERS TO OFFER ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO SCHOOL MEALS. I LIAISE HAVE BEEN SERVING MEALS IN THEIR COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THE STUDENTS AND CHILDREN IN CARE HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY MEALS. THEY DO THIS THROUGH CURBSIDE PICKUP GRABBING GO ALTERNATIVE MEALTIME PICK UPS BUS STOP DELIVERIES AND EVEN HOME DELIVERY. HISTORICALLY ABOUT 40% OF OUR SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING IN THE FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAMS ENCROACH ON THEIR DISTRICTS GENERAL FUND TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS. OF THE NINETEEN HAS CREATED ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON THE SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE ACCOUNTS DUE TO LAST MEAL REVENUE WILL. INCREASE STATIC STAFFING COSTS EQUIPMENT NEEDS AND RISING FOOD COSTS. OVERALL SCHOOLS STATEWIDE ARE EXPERIENCING AN AVERAGE OF A MEALS CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENTS. CITY ABLE UTILIZE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT REMAINS FROM THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET PURSUANT TO ASK THE EIGHT TWENTY TO HELP FILL THE REMAINING GAP FOR THE MONTHS OF MARCH THROUGH AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE AN ESTIMATE ON THE AMOUNT OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS NEEDED TO FILL THAT GAP BUT WE DO BELIEVE I GAP WILL REMAIN BETWEEN THE COSTS THAT PROGRAMS HAVEN'T HEARD. COMPARED TO THE REIMBURSEMENTS THEY HAVE OR WILL RECEIVE FOR THIS TIME PERIOD. WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR SCHOOL SERVICE DIRECTORS THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT THEIR MEAL PROGRAMS BEYOND SCHOOL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO SERVE THEIR STUDENTS. AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE S. S. P. I SUBMITTED A LETTER JUST LAST WEEK TO THE USDA. EMPHASIZING THE NEED TO EXTEND SCHOOL NUTRITION WAIVERS AND FLEXIBILITY THROUGH SEPTEMBER. ADDITIONALLY THE CITY IS WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF. IN ADDRESSING THE FUNDING CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE HEARD. I HAVE WITH ME CAN FRIENDS OUT OF THE DIRECTOR NUTRITION SERVICES DIVISION AT CD AND THE TWO OF US ARE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I NOTICED YOU USED THE- ENCROACHMENT WORDS SOMEWHERE IN THERE. SO YES SIR THAT YEAH THAT'S ALWAYS ALARMING- I WANTED TO STAND BACK AND JUST ASK A MORE GENERAL QUESTION BECAUSE THIS REPORT IS FILLED WITH STATISTICS ON. SORT OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE AND I KNOW SCHOOLS ARE REALLY STEPPING INTO THE BREACH THERE TRYING TO FEED PEOPLE WHILE PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING IN PERSON AT SCHOOL SAID THAT IT'S REALLY HARD. HE THE QUESTION I WAS WONDERING IS THIS SORT OF DOCUMENTS WHAT'S BEING DONE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH FOOD. BUT I KNOW THERE WAS A SIXTY MINUTE STORY A FEW MONTHS AGO ABOUT A SCHOOL IN FLORIDA THAT ASSIGN SOMEBODY TO TRACK DOWN EVERY. STUDENTS AND WHERE THEY WERE ACTUALLY LIVING AND THEN WHETHER THEY NEEDED WRAPAROUND SERVICES RELATED TO HOUSING OR OR DISTANCE LEARNING THAT WAS FAILING MORE NUTRITION. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO WHATEVER EFFORTS INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DOING TO REACH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE FREE AND REDUCED MEALS WHILE SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED IS THERE SOME EFFORT GOING O TO. TO TRY TO REACH PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. AND ARE USING IT. SENATOR I HAVE TO TWO PIECES AT IN RESPONSE THERE AND I IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TO CAN FRIENDS ALR DIRECTOR OF NUTRITION SERVICES WHO REALLY IS ON THE FRONT LINES OF MAKING THINGS HAPPEN FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND I APPRECIATE HER BEING HERE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. WHILE SCHOOL MEALS ARE ONE ENTITY IN WHICH WE NOTICED THAT THE FAMILIES ARE NOT ENGAGED OR NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF FOR THOSE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THERE ARE OTHER OTHER. WAYS THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT WHETHER THAT'S ABSENTEEISM OR FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND SO I WOULD NOTE THAT THE SS PI HAS CREATED A FAMILY ENGAGEMENT UNIT WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. TO WORK ON THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES AND SUGGESTED A BRIEF CALL OUT THERE BUT I WILL HAND IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE KIM FRENZAL TO ANSWER IF SHE HAS ANY- ANECDOTAL OR- STATISTICAL EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING. TO ADDRESS THIS FAMILIES WHO MAYBE AREN'T GETTING THOSE MEALS THAT WE'VE- SEEN IN THE PAST. EIGHT THANK YOU L. AND I'M CAN FRIENDS ALL DIRECTOR OF NUTRITION SERVICES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND AS ALLEY SAID THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE SINCE DAY ONE. AND REALLY TRYING TO ELEVATE- ACCESS TO THE MEALS THAT FAMILIES AND CHILDREN NEED. SO GREAT EXAMPLES THEY HAVE PARTNERED WITH FOOD BANKS SO THAT THEY CAN GET FOOD NOT JUST THAT TO THE CHILDREN ELIGIBLE FOR SCHOOL MEALS. BUT FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY. THEY HAVE. WORKED WITH LOCAL FARMERS TO HELP SUPPORT THE ECONOMY AND RESTAURANTS THAT WERE. JUST GREATLY IMPACTED BY CO THAT NINETEEN FOR- DONATED FOODS AND SO THEY REALLY ARE REACHING OUT TO FAMILIES IN NEED THEY'VE- BEEN. INCREDIBLY INSTRUMENTAL WITH- SUPPORT WITH PANDEMIC EBT AND HELPING CHILDREN GET THOSE BENEFITS THAT. ARE NECESSARY AND DOING A LOT OF OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION TO THEM AND I THINK LA UNIFIED. SCHOOL DISTRICT IS AN AMAZING EXAMPLE OF REALLY LEANING AND EARLY ON TO. FIND COMMUNITY FUNDING OUTSIDE FUNDING SOURCES THAT THEY WERE NOT JUST FEEDING THE CHILDREN BUT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. AND YOU JUST SEE THE STATE WIDE AS FAR AS TRYING TO HELP WITH ALL THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. TO SUPPORT FAMILIES DURING THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I JUST KNOW FROM WORKING WITH MY LOCAL FOOD BANK THAT THEY'RE UP. TWO OR THREE TIMES NORMAL AND DISTRIBUTION AND I. I'D I JUST COULDN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF THERE WERE CERTAIN. KIDS THAT NORMALLY GET FREE TO REDUCE MALES THAT THEN WE'RE SORT OF MOVING OVER TO THAT BUT THEY DO THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN THE SAME WAY TOO SO IN MY VIEW. AND ALLOW ME JUST BE CLEAR THAT WAS NOT MEANT AS A CRITICISM BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY'S BEEN WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD DURING THIS PANDEMIC JUST WONDERING IF THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO BETTER SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ANSWER WHEN WE ASKED THE OTHER SENATORS IF THEY HAVE A QUESTION NOTHING FROM SENATOR MEN CENTER- CHAU BOOK I'M SORRY I HAVE MORE OF A COMMENT I HAVE AS FAR AS THE THAT FAMILIES NOT ENGAGING AS MUCH- COMING FROM A- SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT. AB ONE OF THE- ASPECTS THAT WE TRIED TO MITIGATE WAS. FAMILIES WHO DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRANSPORT THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS TO PICK UP THE MEALS. AND- WE HAD. STE ACCOMMODATED. AND AN ADDITIONAL STAFF TO COME IN THAT TO THE DELIVERY OF THE OF THE MEALS. TO FAMILIES WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO VEHICLES ARE TRANSPORTATION SO JUST ABOUT. AND I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL. THANK YOU TO THOSE PANELS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT PROJECT TO WORK THAT EVERYBODY IS DOING DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR LAST ITEM ITEM SIX TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE UP TO FIVE PANELISTS HERE. FIRST SERVE BERGNER AND JENNIFER KACU FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SERV CORTEZ FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- WE GARNER AND SARAH NOBLE MORGAN FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING OUR- SERVER NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HERE DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR A COMPETITIVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT PROGRAM TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES DECREASE THE NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS AVAILABLE TO SERVE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS. THE GRANT FUNDING CAN BE USED FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES OF CURRENT T. K. AND KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS TO SUPPORT THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND EARLY CHILDHOOD INSTRUCTION OR CHILD DEVELOPMENT. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE INCENTIVE GRANTS TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO EXPAND ACCESS TO T. K. PROGRAMS. THE GRANT FUNDING CAN BE USED FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CREATING OR EXPANDING T. K. PROGRAMS AND IT WILL BE AWARDED OVER MULTIPLE YEARS FOR THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL FOUR YEAR OLDS AND ELLIE PROPOSES TO SERVE IN ITS GRANT APPLICATION. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES A TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONSTRUCT AND RETROFIT EXISTING FACILITIES TO SUPPORT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IN FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. WITH THE GOAL PROVIDING INCREASED ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE FACILITIE FOR TEEKAY AS WELL SCHOOL DAY EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMMING. THAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN COP PACKAGE IN THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS MY COLLEAGUE CHEN CAUCUSES ALSO ON THE LINE HERE WITH ME TODAY COVERING TKA FACILITIES. AND WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. THE MORNING SARAH CORTEZ AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S TKA EXPANSION PACKAGE SO FIRST WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD A PRIOR INTERESTS IN PRESCHOOL EXPANSION. HOWEVER IN MOST RECENT YEARS THE STATE HAS DONE PRESCHOOL EXPANSION THROUGH THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. SO WHETHER T. CARE C. PRESCHOOL IS THE BEST OPTION TO EXPAND REALLY DEPENDS ON THE LEGISLATURE GOALS. SECOND WE NOTE THAT TRANSITIONAL. KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION REQUIRES ONGOING FUNDING WELL THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS ONLY INCLUDES ONE TIME BINDING. WELL THERE ARE SOME ONE TIME COSTS SUCH AS FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND UPDATES THERE ARE ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH I'M SERVING ADDITIONAL STUDENTS SUCH AS HIRING ADDITIONAL TEACHERS. THIRD WE ESTIMATE THE STATE COULD SUSTAIN ONGOING COSTS OF EXPANDING G. K. WITH THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACIFIC WAY WORSE FOR HIM TO IF THE STATE ALLOWED SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO GENERATE A FULL YEAR OF ATTENDANCE BASED FUNDING FOR CHILDREN WITH HER DAYS AFTER DECEMBER SECOND. HOWEVER THIS WOULD LIMIT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO MAKE MAJOR ONGOING PROGRAMMATIC HATEFUL AUGMENTATION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. LASTLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT T. HE EXPANSION IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD HAVE A SIZEABLE IMPACT HONESTY PRESCHOOL WOMAN. ALTHOUGH THE PROGRAM CONSERVE YOUNGER STUDENTS ROUGHLY 63% OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ARE FOUR YEAR OLD. CLARIFYING THE RULES DEEPLY SCHOOL WOULD ENSURE THE STATE'S EXISTING PROGRAMS OPERATE IN ALIGNMENT TO BEST SERVE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT NOW WILL MOVE TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE SENATOR ALEXANDER ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION FULLY SUPPORT THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IN FACILITIES AND TEACHER TRAINING. I HAVE WITH ME SERENATA MORGAN SHE'S THE DEPUTY IS DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL BRANCHES SEAT AND STEPHEN PROFITER THE DIRECTOR OF THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE DIVISION. TO ADDRESS MORE FULLY THE PROPOSAL AND TO TAKE A PRAGMATIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE SARAH. THANK YOU. THANKS SO MUCH THEIR NUMBER MORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ARE GOING TO OUR COMMENTS ON THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WITHIN THE G. K. I WANTED TO START BY GIVING THEM HE BACKGROUND ON CALIFORNIA'S PREKINDERGARTEN SYSTEM IN TOUCH A LITTLE BIT MORE UNLESS THEY'RE A CORTES HIGHLIGHTED. AS A REMINDER THE STATE HAS TO PRE K. PROGRAMS THE CALIFORNIA STATE. PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. OBERNOLTE. THIRTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY JUST OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN. AND OURS CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SERVED AROUND A HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND CHILDREN. IN C. K. 59% MORE FROM THE FREE AND REDUCED PROGRAM YOUNG. WHILE FRIEND THAT CSP P. OR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. AROUND AND 80% WORK FROM AND THEN LEASED. WITH INCOMES BELOW THAT THRESHOLD. DISTRICTS ARE ALLOWED BUT NOT REQUIRED TO OFFER THE EXTENDED G. K. WHERE YOU HAVE YOUNGER CHILDREN AND THE AGE GROUP BEING THAT'S FUNDED THROUGH THE ATV RIGHT CLINTON HAS THESE PROGRAMS. AS WE DROP MORE INTO THE INCENTIVE PART AT THAT. OVERALL REALLY PLEASED TO SEE A PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO PRE K. PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS. IS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. IMPROVING HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES ADDRESSING THE pADDRESSING SYSTEMIC INEQUALITIES AND RACIAL DISPARITIES WE'RE ALSO REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT PRIORITY FOCUS BY THE ADMINISTRATION. ON SUPPORTING PROGRAMS TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR OUR DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. ALL DAY PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE INCLUSIVE OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. AND TO ADDRESS AREAS WHERE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DISPROPORTIONATELY A PARTICULAR RACES OR ETHNICITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. ADDITIONALLY WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY DISTRICTS AFFECTS BREAST AND DESIRE IN THE PAST YOUR EXPANDED THEIR ET QUE PROGRAMS AND SERVE YOUNGER CHILDREN. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES COULD REALLY HELP WITH THAT AS WELL AS LANDING CSP P. AND G. K. PROGRAMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. HOWEVER AS THIS PURPOSE ONLY FORWARD WE WANT TO ELEVATE THE IMPORTANCE ALIGNING WITH THE MASTER PLANNED FOR EARLY LEARNING CARE IS RECOMMENDATIONS. AROUND HAVING A STRONG MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY THAT MASTER PLAN HIGHLIGHT ALIGNING AND STRENGTHENING CURRENT PROGRAMMING. AND QUALITY STANDARDS FOR ENHANCED RISK PROGRAMS. THAT SERVE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. ALL INCLUDES EXPANDING CAL STATE CHRISTOPER. TO INCLUDE YEAR OLDS WITH. INCLUSIVE CLASSROOM SETTINGS THIS WOULD FURTHER SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS AROUND EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION AROUND SPECIAL EDUCATION. THERE'S ALSO A NEED TO CONTINUE SUPPLYING PRESCHOOL DURING NEXT DELIVERY SYSTEM OF COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC SCHOOL BASED PROVIDERS TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE FULL DAY. ACTUALLY WE WOULD SAY WELL THEY CLASS THAT I'LL A LOT OF OUR WORKING FAMILIES NEED INSURANCE SURE EQUITABLE. ACCESS BY FAMILIES AND MEET. IN ADRESSING THAT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TKD AND JAY TEACHERS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS. IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THOSE TEACHING OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS ARE PREPARING TO UNDERSTAND DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES AND PROGRESSION OF LEARNING AND SKILLS CHILDREN WERE FOUR YEAR OLDS BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM SOMEONE WHO IS EIGHT OR TEN YEARS OLD. SHE ENSURING THAT THOSE PROGRAMS. CAN REALLY POLITICAL INCLUSION. PORTANTINO LANGUAGE LEARNERS BY ADDRESSING ONE LANGUAGE STRENGTHENING AS WELL AS ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION. AND TO SUPPORT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING THEIR TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES RESTORATIVE PRACTICES AND MITIGATING. BIAS THAT STARTS IN THE EARLIEST YEARS WE ALSO KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO IMPROVE THE COMPETENCIES OF TEACHERS. THEY HAVE MORE OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION COMPONENT AS PART OF. WE APPRECIATE ALL THOSE WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THE MASTER PLAN COMPONENTS WHICH REALLY WOULD HELP ALIGN THE WORKING WORLD ACROSS THE SYSTEM INTO KINDERGARTEN FIRST AND SECOND AND THIRD GRADE AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE LEGISLATION SURE. ON A DRESSING THOSE COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDE CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I MIGHT HAVE SKIPPED OVER QUICKLY. JENNIFER KACU AND- FINANCE DEPARTMENT WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT FACILITIES AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WANTED TO. SPEAK TO THAT IN ANY WAY TO DO IT NOW. SHERA ALREADY MADE THEIR APARTMENT MARKS BUT- IT'S A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. INVESTMENT AND- HE CARED FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES- AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING FACILITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WAS GONNA ASK A COUPLE OF ROAD GENERAL QUESTIONS AND PROBABLY. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- FIRST I WAS GONNA ASK HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN EARLY T. K. NOW. AND HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN IN BOTH TWO K. AND- WE T. K. DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HOPE TO SUPPORT WITH THESE PROGRAMS- OF THROUGH THESE BUDGET PROPOSALS. HELLO SIR BERNARD WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN TWO U. K. I THINK OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I DID A GREAT JOB LISTING SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS SO WE DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THEM WE THINK THAT THERE'S AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND A FOUR YEAR OLDS BEING SERVED AND T. K. CURRENTLY. UNDER YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN WE ANTICIPATE BEING SERVED WITH THESE GRANTS- PROPOSALS. WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER ON THAT RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAVE EMBEDDED SOME MEASURES WITHIN THE LANGUAGE TO. GATHER DATA ABOUT HOW MANY ADDITIONAL FOUR YEAR OLDS AREBEING PROPOSED TO BE SERVED BY ELLIE AS WILL APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS. AND IT'S- PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS. INCLUDES AN INTENT TO SERVE. THESE EXPANDED TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR THAT DATA THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE HOPE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ELLIE AS- I WILL PUT INTO THEIR GRANT APPLICATION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET HERE- SO THAT BY THE TIME THAT THE GRANT. FUNDING FOR THE INCENTIVE GRANT PROPOSAL ROLLED OUT IN THE- FOLLOWING YEARS- WE WILLKNOW WE WILL HAVE A MUCH CLEARER IDEA OF THE NUMBER. OF THAT THAT THESE THAT THIS GRANT WILL US SUPPORT WELL I THINK I WAS ASKING YOU KNOW. IN A WAY. EVEN THOUGH. FORMER VEGETATION SPOKE TO IT. TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT'S IN THE CURRENT YEAR WHAT MIGHT BE IN THE NEXT YEAR AND WHERE YOU SEE THIS GOING OVER TIME WHETHER WHAT'S THE TOTAL POPULATION. OF PEOPLE ANTI K. AND ARE YOU REALLY SHOOTING TO GET IT THIS YEAR BY YEAR BY INCREASING IT EVERY YEAR THE STAFF TO STRATEGY AND IF SO. HOW MANY YEARS DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO GET WHERE YOU WANTED TO EVENTUALLY GO. THE LANGUAGE INCLUDES AT WITHIN THE APPLICATION THAT ELLIE IS WILL COMPLETE A PROPOSAL FOR HOW THEY PLAN TO EXPAND WITHIN THREE YEARS I THINK. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE AN INTENT TO SERVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CHILDREN WE CAN'T SAY RIGHT NOW WE CERTAINLY HOPE TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM A LOT OF THE INTENT FOR THESE PROPOSALS IS TO START SOME OF THESE CAPACITY BUILDING MEASURES THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN SO THIS IS OUR FIRST. TAKE OUT THIS WOULD BE WITH THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AND BE. INFRASTRUCTURE BUT FUNDS IN THE INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM- SO IN TERMS OF OUR LONG TERM PLAN AND WE KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS VERY INTERESTED IN EXPANDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER ON THAT RIGHT NOW PER SE BUT WE CERTAINLY ARE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE TAKE UP WILL BE LIKE AND TO WORK WITH OUR- PROGRAMMATIC PARTNERS IN OUR LEGISLATIVE PARTNERS. TO ADDRESS THE IMPLICATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PROGRAMS MOVING FORWARD. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THE TERMS TO GETTING THE DATA AS YOU GO ALONG. BUT IT WOULD REALLY BE NICE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR LONG TERM GOALS ARE IN IT AS WITH ANYTHING IF THEY'RE MILLION KIDS AND WE'RE DOING A HUNDRED THOUSAND NOW AND I KNOW THAT NUMBERS HIGH. I AM JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BY YEAR HOW YOU GET THERE AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE COLLECTING. THE INFORMATION RETROSPECTIVELY IT AND THEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU'RE DOING IT AND I JUST THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS OVER TIME IT BE GOOD TO KNOW WHAT THE TOTAL UNIVERSITY IS IN. AND HOW MUCH WE'RE MOVING TOWARD IT EVERY YEAR AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR FUTURE COMMITMENT SO JUST THAT SOMETHING I WOULD BE. INTERESTED IN SEEING AS YOU TALK ABOUT THIS OVER TIME YOU JUST ANSWERED THE QUESTION BUT IT IS I THINK IT STILL BEGS THE ISSUE OF WHAT THESE NUMBERS ARE OVER TIME AND WHERE. WE'RE GOING BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT COMMITMENT OF MONEY IF IT'S GOING TO BE THAT OVER. TIME OF WHAT IT MEANS AND WHAT IT'S GOING TOMAIN GO THERE. THE OTHER. I IS. AND IT ROUGHER. IN AS WELL. BUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATION ENVISIONS STATE PRESCHOOL AND EARLY T. CURRY. ALIGNING AND THEN ACTUALLY I KNOW WAS ASKED. COOPER ALREADY WHY EXPAND. T. K. AS OPPOSED TO PRESCHOOL- JUST SO. TALK ABOUT THE ALIGNING AND WHY THERE'S A PREFERENCE FOR ONE OVER THE OTHER WOULD WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR- SO I'LL SAY A FEW THINGS TO THAT AND SO- TO START I WOULD NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT PROPOSING ANY CHANGES TO THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AT THIS TIME. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AS WELL THAT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT AGAIN OUR OUR CD PARTNERS REALLY HIGHLIGHTED- DO SERVE QUITE A FEW FOUR YEAR OLD ARE STILL A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING. PRESCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS- SO THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST POINT AND THEN TO GET TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHY TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN OVER STATE PRESCHOOL- AGAIN THE ADMINISTRATION IS VERY INTERESTED IN PROVIDING. IN EXPANDING ACCESS FOR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT WE COULD TAKE. THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL REALLY ALIGNS WITH DATA THAT HAS COME OUT FROM THE MASTER PLAN WITH THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN POLICY. OF FEATURES OF THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS CHILDREN TO BE IN NEXT INCOME CLASSROOMS- THAT THAT IS REALLY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL SO. THERE ARE FEW FEATURES OF TKA THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO LOK INTO AND EXPAND- AND THAT'S NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR THE FIELD- SINCE. AND LET ME JUST GIVE A CHANCE FOR EITHER THE L. A. OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO COMMENT ON WHAT WAS JUST SAID KELLY- DO YOU HAVE ANY THING TO HAND- AND ALSO I HAD TO GET A MAY STATEMENT ABOUT- WHAT CAN REPROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE MONSTER EXPAND ALTERNATELY DEPENDS ON ITS OWN SPECIFIC GOALS. I'M SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO OFFER A ONE YEAR PUBLIC SCHOOL OF PUBLIC PRESCHOOL TO ALL STUDENTS. ON THE G. K. COULD BE A BETTER PATH TO EXPANSION BECAUSE THE STATE COULD USE SCHOOL DISTRICT CATCHMENT AREAS AS A WAY TO ENSURE. THAT ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL- IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO OFFER PRESCHOOL TO ALL THREE FOUR YEAR OLD FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND STATE PRESCHOOL COULD BE A BETTER PATH TO EXPANSION. STATE I'M SO THOSE AREJUST SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS- THAT WE RATES WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS THINKING ABOUT KIND OF WHAT WHAT THE PAST EXPANSION AS- THANK YOU AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ANYTHING TO ADD. YES THIS IS THEIR NUMBER MARK AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE JUST WANNA ADAM BALDOCK WITH BOTH OF THIS THERE IS IT'S ALWAYS THE STAIRS DOWN EARLY AND I HAVE ALREADY STATED THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT STANDS BEHIND MIXED INCOME IN SETTING. AND SO REGARDLESS SEVENTY TWO YEARS THE S. B. P. WE THINK THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO ADDRESS AND THAT NEED TO HAVE MIXED INCOME AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT ALL CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES COULD BE INCLUDED SO THAT THEY'RE IN NOT INCLUSIVE ATTY SO IN ADDITION TO LOOKING UP OF WORLD WE WANT TO STRESS THAT THAT MASTER DATA DROPS THE THREE YEAR OLDS. IN NOT EXPANSION OF CST KEY TO INCLUDE ALL CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT ONCE AGAIN GOING BACK TO ENSURING THAT CHILDREN WHO HAD I AT THIS EASIER INDIVIDUALIZED FAMILY SERVICE PLANS WHICH GO UP TO AGE THREE COULD ALSO PARTICIPATE A LOT OF THE CHILDREN AS THEY TRANSITION. I GAVE. THAN AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR IDA KIRBY WHICH IS WHAT STARTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AT AGE THREE AND SO IF WE WANTED TO ADDRESS MORE MORAL GROUND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS OR PREVENT LATER NEED FOR PARTICIPATION IN IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES THAT. REALLY EXPANDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THOSE INCLUSIVE SETTINGS WOULD BE. IDEAL ALSO THAT WE WOULD BE AND IN NOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW S. IF IT OF THE SAN. THE ROOM I'M A CO CENTERMAN. HI THANK YOU FOR THIS PURPOSE I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT HOW IT COMPARES AND PER INNER WITH AB TWO TWO. THE BILL- FOR PRESCHOOL ANTI K. INTRODUCED BY VARIOUS ASSEMBLY AND SIGNED ON- BY NUMBER SENATORS INCLUDING MYSELF HAVE YOU COMMUNICATED AND INTERACTED WITH ANY THE PRINCIPAL AUTHORS OF THIS BILL AND MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE AN ANALYSIS FOR THE PART OF FINANCE ON HOW THE PROVISIONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD COMPARE TO THE PROVISIONS AB TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU CENTERMAN SO AT THIS TIME- WE HAVEN'T DIVED SUPER DEEPLY AND SAID THAT BILL- WE KNOW THAT IT'S IN THE WORKS AND- I ASSUME SIMILARLY TO PAST YEARS WHEN A LOT OF OUR PRIORITIES ALIGN I'M SURE THAT WE WILL HAVE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. ARE MOVING FORWARD ABOUT- OUR VARIOUS INTERESTING PROPOSALS AND PRIORITIES HERE SO AT THIS TIME NO WE HAVEN'T HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS QUITE YET BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. YOU AND YOUR PARTNERS AND THE LEGISLATURE MOVING FORWARD AND- ON. SHE CAN PRESCHOOL EXPANSION IDEAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT'S ALL I HAVE THANK YOU SANDRA TROUBLED. FOR YOUR GOOD.

THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE THE ONE POINT FIVE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THE FACT THAT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING SERVICES FOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND SCHOOL NUTRITION REQUIRED THE PAYING TREATMENT AS THE LPS BACK. AND WE ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER PROVIDING THE SAME COMPOUND AND COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AT THREE POINT EIGHT FOUR PERCENT. INSTEAD OF JUST THE ONE POINT 5% PROVIDED FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR MODERATOR NEXT BECAUSE- WE'LL GO TO LINE NUMBER THIRTEEN LINE THIRTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

K. THAT IS THE CENTRAL WI FI MECHANICALLY STABILIZED. CHILD CARE WITH THEM I PERSONALLY THINK ABOUT ALREADY FRAGILE AND IT'S BEEN I'M BEGINNING TO GET RESTRAINT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC STABILIZATION WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE INVESTING IN RATE REFORM AND EXPANDING ACCESS ESPECIALLY FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS. I'M AT THE SAME TIME WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THAT WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE- ISSUES ESPECIALLY FOR EVEN YOUNGER AND FOUR YEAR OLD SO FOR EXAMPLE THE VERY LARGE- A TEACHER THAT TO CHILD RATIO. I'M TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE ADULTS IN THE CLASSROOM AND THAT WE ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE EXPANSION- AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PUT FORTH COMMITTEE INCENTIVE GRANT BUT- AS WAS NOTED BY THE L. A. L.
