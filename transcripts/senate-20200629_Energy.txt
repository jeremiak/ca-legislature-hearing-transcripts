MISTER VICE CHAIR GOOD MORNING SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS IN THIS WON'T TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE VICE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS HEARING TODAY. THE VICE CHAIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A- JUST A FEW OBSERVATIONS I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO. MAYBE I JUST PRESENT THEM SINCE I'M LOOKS LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE SPEAKING IN AND- THE WORLD FAMOUS. SENATOR HILTON. RESPOND TO THEM IT IS CLOSING COMMENTS. BUT I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED. MISTER CHAIR ABOUT THE NATURE OF. WHAT'S OCCURRING HERE IT. SEEMS LIKE. GOD THE STATE IS TRYING TO NATIONALIZE- A COMPANY AND I'M- A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW. THAT OCCURS IN OTHER AREAS SO I. I GUESS ONE OF THE- QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE IS. WHAT OTHER EXAMPLES DO WE HAVE THAT WE COULD. RESEARCH WERE A- PRIVATELY. OWNED PUBLICLY OWNED DEBT AND TRADED CORPORATION WAS- BOUGHT OUT BY A- STATE. OR OTHER GOVERNMENT- THAT WERE WORKED IN AND I COULD. I COULD LOOK AT IT I'VE I'VE LOOKED AT THE HISTORY OF P. JEANNIE AND- THEY GOT A REMARKABLE. HISTORY ON WIKIPEDIA- BUT I'M ONE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. HOW IT WORKS TO. WERE THE FUNDING COME FROM. THE REPORT STATES IT COULD COST UP TO FIVE POINT. EIGHT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. AND SO WITH THAT COME FROM THE RAINY DAY FUND OR WOULD WE ASK CALPERS YOUR CAL STIRS TO STEP IN- OR WE CAN USE FUNDS FROM OUR RETIREE MEDICAL TRUST OR WE GONNA USE DEBT PROCEEDS. AND THEN- HOW WOULD WE AS A LEGISLATURE KNOW. HOW WOOD PENCILS OUT BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY WANT TO AVOID RATE INCREASES. THE THIRD QUESTION. I WOULD ASK IS- WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BID. FOR IT IF IT WERE IN THE BANKRUPTCY- BUT- I JUST WANNA KNOW HOW. THAT WORKS BECAUSE THERE'S- A POINT ON PAGE NINE OF THE STAFF REPORT THAT. IS RATHER COERCIVE IN. YOU KNOW ALMOST LIKE AN IMMINENT CAN OF OFFER. WERE THE FREE MARKET REALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE. AND SO I GUESS IT CLOSING MY CONCERNS WOULD BE YOU KNOW. HOW WELL WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RUN. P. JEANNIE SURE THAT TAKE OVER CONTROL- YOUKNOW TO GET TO CYNICAL BUT I'VE- CERTAINLY BEEN- FRUSTRATED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OF LATE TO THE DMV. FISCALE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE OUR KAFFIR OUT YET. OUR COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT WERE THE ONLY STATE THAT HASN'T DONE THAT. AND WE ARE WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICITS AND I'M JUST. YOU KNOW JUST REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE CAPABLE OF ACTUALLY RUNNING AN OPERATION OF. OF THIS SUBSTANCE. SO I GUESS- IN IN IN THE CLOSING HOW DO YOU HOW TO THE POSITIVES OUTWEIGH THE MINUSES OTHER THAN. YOU KNOW BUT JUST BEING A LITTLE STRONG HANDED. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. FOR MR MUCH. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND IN TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR HILL ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE TO THE VICE CHAIR IS COMMON CITY JUST ME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE FOR MY GOOD FRIEND FROM RIVERSIDE WHO I ADMIRE AND RESPECT- SO MUCH I. ADDITIONAL SURPRISE WITH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS BECAUSE- ALL OF THAT INFORMATION WAS LAID OUT IN THAT AN ALESIS AND STAFF REPORT WHICH- CLEARLY IDENTIFIES. CLEARLY ARTICULATES THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT A PUBLIC. THIS IS NOT A GOVERNMENT OWNED WOULD NOT BE A GOVERNMENT FINANCED UTILITY IF IT WERE TO. IN FACT COME TO FRUITION OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. REQUIRED FOR GOLDEN STATE ENERGY TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY AND OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY AND FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE. THIS IS- WILL BE FORMED AND NATIONALLY WITH THE BOARD OF NINE MEMBERS FIVE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR TO FROM THE SENATE TO FROM THE ASSEMBLY. AND THEN AFTER THAT IT WOULD TRANSITION IN THAT BOARD ORIGINAL BOARD WOULD USING A SEARCH FIRM. TRY TO FIND AND DEVELOP A BOARD US STATURE AND- STRUCTURE. THAT WOULD FIT CERTAIN SKILL SET MATRIXES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO OPERATE UTILITY. AT ALL TIME THIS WOULD BE PROVIDED BE. OWNED BY AT THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE OWNED BY THE RATE PAYERS NOT BY GOVERNMENT. AT ALL GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT BE FINANCING IT AS THE RIBBON ALICE'S SAYS AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY. THE FUNDING AND FINANCING WOULD BE SECURED THROUGH THE AYE BANK. WHICH WOULD GIVE US THE- THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY AND- RATE PAYERS WOULD THEN BE. PROVIDED THE RESOURCES BACK TO THE AYE BANK INTO THIS THE STATE TO. TO MEET THAT OBLIGATION AND CERTAINLY BE PASSING THAT ON TO THE- THE- THE OF THE REPAIRS. THE INTERESTING PART IS THAT IF YOU HAD A YOU KNOW WE HAVE MANY PUBLIC UTILITY **** IN FACT IN. SACRAMENTO IS A GOVERNMENT UTILITY. THAT THAT DOES PROVIDE A GOOD SERVICE THIS IS A HYBRID. PRETTY MUCH FROM A PUBLIC GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP TO A RATE PAYER OWNED- UTILITY THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS THAT AS A- RATE PAYER OWNED UTILITY WE WOULD BE AND ACCORDING TO THIS SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IF YOU KNOW PUBLIC. MUNICIPAL YOU TO TODAY ARE NOT SO TO ANY REGULAR AT THE- OF THE PEOPLE BEGIN TO REACH COMMISSION OTHER WAS A TIME WHEN I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY SAID THAT'S NOT A BAD THING. BUT TODAY WITH THE REFORMED AND- STRUCTURE AND- LEADERSHIP OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THEY HAVE THE ABILITY AND I BELIEVE WILL DO- EXTRAORDINARY JOB OF MANAGING. OVER SEEN THIS NEW UTILITY. IT IS NOT NECESSARY THIS IS SURELY DETERMINED THAT IF CERTAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. OCCUR THAT. GOLDEN STATE ENERGY WOULD TAKE OVER OR IN FACT IF P. JEANNIE FAILS IN THE FUTURE. THAT WOULD BE LEFT TO THE MARKET PLACE TO DECIDE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WOULD CERTAINLY- THE REMOVE OR TAKE AWAY THEIR THEIR LICENSE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY. OR CERTIFICATE OR LICENSE AND IT OF NECESSITY AND- IT AND THEN IT WOULD BE- UP TO THE P. YOU SEE TO FIND WHATEVER BUYER WOULD BE IN PLACE TO DO THAT. GOLDEN STATE ENERGY IN THE REASON WE'RE DOING THIS TODAY IS TO POSITION ITSELF. AND SO THAT THERE IS NO LAPSE OF SERVICE TO WORK TO THE CUSTOMERS THAT THERE IS AN ENTITY IN PLACE. IF IN FACT IT IS THE BEST. OFFER THE BEST A- POSITION TO SECURE THAT THAT THEY ARE READY TO DO THAT WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE WE DON'T WANT TO GAMBLE WITH THE FACT WITH THE WITH THE REPAIRS OR THE SERVICE. TERRITORY THE SIXTEEN MILLION CUSTOMERS OF P. JEANNIE HAS TODAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS SOMEONE. IN PLACE THIS IS THAT PLAN AND- IT IN THAT I THINK I'VE ANSWERED EARLY SHOULD ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS A- SENATOR. IT'S A VICE CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK- THE CENTER FOR- IS- THOROUGHNESS IS RESPONSE ARE PRE SHADED JUST CURIOUS. IN A RUNNING A BUSINESS AND HAVING THE RATE PAYERS BE THE STAKEHOLDERS- WHAT WE'RE JUST GONNA RELY ON. INSURANCE AND OTHER VEHICLES TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE. THAT TODAY WOULD BE PROTECTED. IT'S SO I GUESS MY QUESTION ME WHAT SAFEGUARDS DO WE HAVE IN PLACE. MINIATURE THANK YOU. THERE OF ISSUES AND CERTAIN AS THIS IS THE- AS A PUBLIC BENEFIT NONPROFIT CORPORATION BECAUSE OF THAT STATUS IT TOO WILL BE PAYING NO STATE INCOME TAX. SECONDLY IT WILL NOT BE PAYING- AND THE- RATE OF RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS SO THERE'S NO SHAREHOLDER PAYMENTS OR DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS WHICH IS TODAY FOR P. JEANNIE AMOUNTS TO A BILLION AND A HALF TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF WHEN THEY WERE A GOOD COMPANY WHEN THEY BECOME ONE AGAIN- SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF BILLION DOLLARS THERE AS WELL AS A SAVINGS IN. IN PERSONAL OF CORPORATE INCOME TAX TO THE STATE THAT WOULD BE. NOT SPENT AND SAVED SO IF YOU LOOK AT THAT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THAT MONEY YOU DOES LEAVE THE RATE PAYERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT LIABILITY WITH INSURANCE WITH THE WILDFIRE FUNDS THAT WE ESTABLISH LAST YEAR THAT WILL PROTECT. THE UTILITY FROM A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THAT THAT LIABILITY- BUT JUST AS IN THIS LEGISLATION A PENALTY THAT WILL IF. THE UTILITY FAILS IN SOME REGARD AS GOLDEN STATE ENERGY AND- A PENALTY IS ASSESSED AGAINST THEM. WHERE IS IN A- INVESTOR OWNED YOU THAT PENALTY WOULD GO TO SHAREHOLDERS BY LAW HERE IT WOULD GO TO THE RATE PAYERS BUT- MY ASSUMPTION MY FEELING AND WHY I SUPPORT THIS. IS THAT THE SAVINGS OVER TIME. BECAUSE OF THE RATE OF RETURN IN THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THIS NECESSARY GOING FORWARD IN INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS- TO HARDEN AGREED IN TO MAKE IT WORK. IS SUBSTANTIAL AND THAT SAVINGS WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL FOR GOLDEN STATE ENERGY SO THAT I BELIEVE THE COST WOULD ACTUALLY BE A SAVINGS TO THE RATE PAYERS IN THE FUTURE. RATHER THAN A GREATER COST. THANKS A MEASURE OF YOUR CENTER THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE HAVE QUITE A FEW MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO SPEAK MEMBER WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR WIENER WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR DOLLY. CENTER STERN AND INTO OUR MAJORITY LEADER CENTER WE KNOW THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU RESERVE. SHARE. SO I THINK SOMETIMES A IS THIS A SOME. THAT THE A PRIVATE. CORPORATION IS. ALL GOING TO BE A- BETTER IN TERMS RUNNING SOMETHING A YOU TO. BENJAMIN OPERATE UTILITY IT'S GOING TO BE THAN THE GOVERNMENT THAN A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND I DON'T THINK THE VALET. A SOME I THINK THE IS IN THE RIGHT HERE P. GINNY HAS BEEN A PRIVATE- SHAREHOLDER% CORPORATION FOR YOU KNOW CENTURY- MPG IS A COMPLETE DISASTER- IT IS A BAD COMPANIES. IT HAS COMPLETELY FAILED IT IS BURNED DOWN ENTIRE TOWN HAS ALLOWED ITS INFRASTRUCTURE TO FALL APART- IT IS IT IS IT'S A IT'S A FAILURE AND I AND THAT SADDENS ME TO SAY THAT BECAUSE- IT IS OF IT AND THERE WON'T BE ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY'RE MOVING BUT IT'S BEEN A SAN FRANCISCO COMPANY. AND IT'S A COMPANY THAT HAS FAILED AS A SHAREHOLDER OWNS PRIVATE UTILITY MEANWHILE WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES- THAT HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL INCLUDING RIGHT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN SACRAMENTO. AS WELL AS LOS ANGELES AND OTHER AREAS- WE HAVE CITIES THAT RUN DIFFERENT KINDS OF UTILITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE A WATER UTILITY WE HAVE A SEWER UTILITY WE HAVE A SMALL ELECTRIC UTILITY- AND THEY HAVE BEEN- QUITE A SUCCESSFUL SO I DON'T THINK IT'S INHERENT. THAT THE PRIVATELY OWNED MODEL- WITH UTILITIES IS BETTER AND IN THIS CASE I THINK IT'S WORSE I YOU KNOW I'D PERSONALLY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH AND OBVIOUSLY I INTRODUCED A BILL EARLIER THIS YEAR- TO GO IN THIS DIRECTION FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION NOW- AND NOT GIVE TEACHING. YET ANOTHER CHANCE PIGEON IS A PLENTY OF CHANCES A HASN'T WORKED AND NOW WE HAVE YET ANOTHER BANKRUPTCY AND ALL A PROBLEM THAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS THE OLD MY PREFERENCE WOULD B. SYSTEM START THE PROCESSING. THE TERM PGT INTO A PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION- OBVIOUSLY PERSPECTIVE ON THAT NOT. PREVAIL IN THE LARGEST. AND THE TO THE MARKETS AND I. ONE WHEN I'M NOT ON THE WINNING SO OF IT IS BUT I THINK THIS IS THE NEXT BEST APPROACH TO SAY WE'LL GIVE YOU THE ONE MORE. BUT THEN YOU WILL BECOME A PUBLIC BY CORPORATION OF DON'T GET IT TOGETHER THE MORE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER WIENER BEFORE WE GO CENTER TO CENTER HILLS ITEM LEAD TO COME ON. THE YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MUCH. BUDGET CENTER DOLLY THE FOR IS YOURS. BUT THE YOU MANAGER FOR. MAPS USING. MISTER CHAIRMAN. HOUSING TO I WANT TO DO IS TO. I READ THIS FOR. AND I WANTED TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS FIRST I WANT TO KNOW KNOW THAT YOU. THAT THERE BEEN A SEVERAL PEOPLE. MY OVER THE- THAT I. TRIED TO FIGURE OUT. A BETTER SOONER THAN WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT THEN AND I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO IN MY SIMPLY DISTRICT I REPRESENTED. A FOLKS IN MIGUEL YOU WHICH WE LOST IT WAS IN THE CAMP FIRE AND SO. AND THEN ALSO THE CAR FIRE AND I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON. ABOUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH OUR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM- MAINLY P. JEANNIE BUT I WANT TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS AND- LOOK I BELIEVE THEY'LL FAIL I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS. WERE THE WINDS BLOWING LIKE CRAZY OUT THERE TODAY. IT'S BEEN BLOWN EVERY DAY THIS WEEK AT LEAST- THIS WEEKEND WHEN I WAS HOME. AND IT'S DRY IN NO DOUBT WILL PROBABLY HAVE A FIRE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A STRUCTURES IS NOT IN PLACE WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. RIGHT NOW TODAY. BUT THAT BEING SAID I WANT TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS. I HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE I HAVE WHERE MY HOME IS. I'M GONNA RULE ELECTRIC. AND WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN WE HAD. NO ELECTRICITY OUT THERE THEY ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZED AMERICA DID. WHAT THEY CALL RULE ELECTRICS WE WERE ABLE TO BOND OURSELVES. AND BRING TRANSMISSION LINES CLEAR OUT WHERE THERE WAS VERY FEW PEOPLE. AND PUT IN A SYSTEM THAT IS. ACTUALLY OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE PEOPLE WE HAVE AN ELECTED BOARD THEY RUN FOR OFFICE. IT'S A NON PAID POSITION. AND WE HAVE VERY. REASONABLE RATES AND WE HAVE A- SYSTEM THAT. IS NOT BURNING DOWN MY COMMUNITIES. SO I WOULD LIKE THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE THIS. PUBLIC THE PRIVATE PART OR PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP IS WHAT I GUESS I WOULD SAY IF PGD FAILS IS THAT IT'S FIVE APPOINTMENTS BY THE GOVERNOR IT'S THERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WILL MAKE UP. THOSE APPOINTMENTS IN AND I'LL SURELY I'VE BEEN SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED- AND I DON'T YEAH AS YOU ALL KNOW I DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT PARTISAN POLITICS I LIKE SOLUTIONS I LIKE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE TO GET THINGS DONE BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU. I BROUGHT UP LAST WEEK DURING THE BUDGET THAT WE HAD. ANOTHER MANDATE FOR SOLAR. AND I AND I BROUGHT IT UP EVERY TIME WE TALK ABOUT SOLAR AND WE'RE WE'RE EXPORTING SOLD OUT OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S COSTING THE RATEPAYERS MONEY I WANT YOU TO HEAR ME I'M SAID I'M A SAY THAT AGAIN IT COST US MONEY AND WHAT WE DO WE INCENTIVIZE SOLAR AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S FEEL GOOD LEGISLATION. THAT COMES FROM FOLKS ON BOTH SIDES OUT OVER THAT STUFF BUT IT'S WRONG IS DRIVING THE RATES UP FOR CALIFORNIANS AND IT'S JUST WRONG SO I'M ASKING OUT TODAY TO VOTE FOR A BILL THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE APPOINTMENTS. HEY MORGAN AROUND THIS WE'RE GONNA RUN THIS CORPORATION IT TELLS SUPPOSED WHAT DO WE DO LIKE WE DO WITH THE RULE LECTORES. GIVE IT BACK TO THE RACKS RATEPAYERS. THE PEOPLE THERE THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY PAY THE BILL LIKE I DO IN MY ROLE LETTERING AND I'VE ELECTED BOARD. FROM THAT ARE IN THERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE- WHEN THERE IS A FIRE I HAVE TO PAY THE BILL. MY RATES WILL GO UP. BEEN IN IN MY RULE ELECTRIC. EDITOR'S NOTE THERE IS NO. PRIVATE PEOPLE THERE IS NO THERE'S NO GOVERNOR INVOLVED IN THERE'S DEBTS IT'S OUR SYSTEM. WE SHOULD BACK BONDS TO PAY OFF THE DEBTS IF THIS. AND ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO RUN THEIR OWN. ELECTRIC UTILITY LIKE WE HAVE MODELS ALL OVER AMERICA THE WORD GREAT. THERE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE PEOPLE. SO I KNOW THAT IT MAY IT IS TRUE TO ME IT'S LIKE IT'S JUST SET UP WRONG AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET. ALL SEIZE THE COME OUT THIS LEGISLATOR BECAUSE THERE'S LOBBY THAT DRIVE. THESE DECISIONS LIKE THE SOLAR MANDATE. N. ANNA AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME IT'S NOT GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE RAPE WHERE THE RATES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO UP YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA IS IT IS. SO FOR ME TODAY I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. NOT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WE CAN ALL WORK HARD BUT IT'S THE DRAWING STRUCTURE. WAS PUT IN A STRUCTURE. WHERE WE- CAN GO OUT AND BOND THE DEBT WHATEVER THAT DEBT IS THAT THE WHEN THEY FAIL. AND WE ACTUALLY LET THE PEOPLE THAT. PAY THE BILL THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY THE RATE PAYERS. LIKE THE OTHER WE I MEAN P. JEANNIE TERRITORY WERE MY FARM IS AN A RULE ELECTRIC WHERE MY- FOR MY PROCESSING PLAN IS WHY MY IN THAT WHAT DID I PICKED UP PLEASE USE THE RATES ARE A LOT LESS THERE AND I GET BETTER SERVICE. SO FOR THAT FOR THOSE REASONS AND MEMBERS I URGE YOU. TO LOOK AT THE POLICIES THAT WE PUT OUT HERE WHEN IT COMES TO SOLAR. AND WIND AND- THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL BEHIND THE SCENES THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S VERY POWERFUL LOBBY. IN THIS CAPITAL THIS IS DRIVING THE RATES UP AND I WANT TO JUST SAY IN CLOSING THAT I COMMEND THE GOOD SENATOR I KNOW THIS IS THAT WE WORKED ON I AND WE TALKED HAD THIS CONVERSATION EARLIER. BUT I THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO IT AND I KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'RE MAKING SAUSAGE IT'S TOUGH. IN THIS BUILDING SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION TODAY. SENATE ALRIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'RE GONNA ASSET ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THE CHAMBERS PLEASE REFRAIN FROM MAKING ANY NOISE OR CLAPPING WE'D GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. SENATOR HILL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU RESPOND AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ESTABLISH A QUORUM CITY VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THAT AND MY GOOD FRIEND AND SENATOR WHO LOST HIS COMMUNITIES WERE. THE SO DESTROYED AND- IT IS MANY OF YOU HAVE AS I WITNESSED. IT TOWARD THAT AREA- IT'SNOTHING THAT YOU WILL NEVER EVER FORGET- AN EXTRA DARK PERIODS BUT I GUESS AS I WAS LISTENING TO. THE WORLD- AERIAL. ELECTRIC RURAL UTILITIES AND- IT EXACT WHAT- MY FRIEND WAS SAYING I'M THINKING. THIS BILL IS GIVING US EXACTLY THAT. EXACTLY THAT BECAUSE IT STARTS OUT WITH THE BOARD OF NINE MEMBERS. TOP FIVE WOULD BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR TO BY THE SENATE TO BY THE ASSEMBLY THEN AFTER THAT IS THE NEW BOARD TRANSITIONS. INTO THE- FORMAL BOARD AS THEY LOOK TO FIND A SKILL SET AND THEN A SLATE OF MEMBERS THAT WILL THEN GO TO THE RATE PAYERS. WHO WILL SELECT THE NEW BOARD AND THAT BOARD WILL BE SELECTED OF SIX MEMBERS TO A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD WILL BE SELECTED BY THE RATE PAYERS WHO WILL THEN BE IN THE MAJORITY ONE MEMBER BY THE GOVERNOR THEN ONE BY THE ASSEMBLY ONE BY THE SENATE. AND THEY WILL DECIDE THE PAUL POLICIES IN MOVING FORWARD WITH THE UTILITY WE WOULD MAJOR STEPS IN THE ASSEMBLY MAJOR- CONVERSATIONS TO STRUCTURE GOLDEN STATE ENERGY AS NOT AN INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS DONE INTENTIONALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT A STATE OPERATED STATE OWNED OR STATE CONTROLLED- UTILITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID AND I THINK SUCCESSFULLY IN THE LANGUAGE AND IN THE LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS THAT WE RECEIVED SO THE RATE PAYERS WILL OWN IT. THE RATE PAYERS WILL BOND AGAINST IT THE RATE PAYERS WILL SET THE RATES AND THE RATE PAYERS WILL BE IN CHARGE AND CONTROL SO THIS SOUNDS TO ME LIKE EXACTLY THE TYPE OF UTILITY THAT IS IN THE RURAL AREAS AND STUFF WE SHOW THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH HELLO WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE HEARING FROM CENTER STERN CENTER HERTZBERG BEFORE WE DO THAT MISS BUT HE SAID IT'S CULTURAL. SENATE MCGUIRE HERE SENATE MCGUIRE HERE SENATOR MARTHA.

JERRY HAVE CORN THANK YOU SO MUCH QUORUM IS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR GOING TO GO BACK TO COMMENT FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WERE GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SINNERS STERN GOOD MORNING SINISTER. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR HILL FOR. THIS IS THE CULMINATION OF A CAREER IT'S WORTH OF CRITICAL OVERSIGHT AND LEADERSHIP WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSFORMING THIS BROKEN UTILITY. I AM I'M PLEASED TO. WITH THE WORK PRODUCT THAT THAT EMERGED HERE AND WE KNOW IT'S BEEN A ROCKY PATH AND IN FACT WHEN THE WHEN THE CONCEPT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. IF THEY WERE GOING TO ARRIVE AT ANY KIND OF DEAL- IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IF ANY KIND OF SETTLEMENT WAS GOING TO BE APPROVED AT ALL AND IF ANYONE'S GONNA BE COMING TO THE TABLE- WE KNOW THE THAT THE PICTURE LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT NOW BUT- I STILL THINK THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. BUT I WANTED TO JUST. MAKE ONE COMMENT AND ASK YOU A QUESTION JUST FOR CLARITY THE RECORD PURPOSES. I YOU KNOW THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME IMPLICATION THAT THIS MEASURE. IS GOING TO CONSTITUTE A DEBT FOR A LIABILITY HANGING OVER THE HEAD OF NOT JUST NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS OR TAXPAYERS BUT ALL OF THE STATE I'M A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REPAIRMAN EDISON CUSTOMER. AND YOU KNOW I READ THE MEASURE ACTUALLY IS EXPLICITLY BARRING SUCH A LIABILITY FROM BEING INCURRED BY THE PASSAGES LET LEGISLATION. AND IN FACT IT. NOT ONLY YOU KNOW OR THAT THE SOME OF THE TAX PURPOSES THAT YOU MENTIONED- BUT- IS IT IS IT NOT THE CASE THAT THEIR EXPRESSLY BARRED- IN THE FORMATION OF GSC FROM THAT CONSTITUTING A DEBTOR LIABILITY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IS THE YEAR THE GOAL AND THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION- THE- THE GOAL HAS BEEN IN THE LANGUAGE I THINK. ARTICULATES THAT FACT THAT TOO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE COMPANY IN FACT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT'S WHERE THIS CONVERSATION REALLY OCCURRED- BECAUSE WE WANTED TO. PICK THE GUARANTEE NEEDED TO BE IN PLACE THAT THE STRUCTURE THE GOVERNANCE AND THE MAIN OPERATION OF THE COMPANY WAS DONE IN A MANNER THAT THERE WOULD NEVER BE AN INTERPRETATION THAT THIS WAS AN INSTRUMENTALITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEREFORE BE LAW THE RATE PAYERS OR THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND LIABLE FOR THIS SO THAT THAT WAS FROM THE BEGINNING THE GOAL THE INTENT AND THAT'S THE STRUCTURE IN THE FINANCING STRUCTURES ARE PART OF THAT. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT WORK AND I THINK I THINK FROM A DRAFTING PERSPECTIVE IT'S DONE BEEN DONE PRETTY CLEARLY HERE I MEAN I SEE BASICALLY. THOSE FOLLOWING ALONG THE TEXAN PART. FOUR THREE FOUR FOUR TWO. INDEED IT IS SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE DEBTOR LIABILITY THE STATE OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THERE OF THAT'S IN-SECTION SUBSECTION A AND THEN SEE SAYS- THE ISSUANCE OF INDEBTEDNESS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENT LEE OBLIGATE THE STATE. OR ANY OTHER POLITICAL SUBDIVISION TO LEVY A PLEDGE ANY FORM OF TAXATION OR TO MAKE AN APPROPRIATION FOR THREE PAYMENT. SO I THINK THE BILL IS PRETTY PLAIN IN ITS WORDING SO. FROM A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE BUT- I DON'T SEE A FINANCIAL RISK AND IN FACT. I SEE IT THIS IS A POSITIVE STEP FOR TO GET A BIT OF AN EQUITY STAKE. FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE NOT SO MUCH FROM A FINANCIAL OBLIGATION BUT FROM A FROM ACTUALLY HOW WE WANT THESE CALIFORNIA UTILITIES TO BE GOVERNED I SEE IT AS A POSITIVE THING TO HAVE A FEW. THREE MEMBERS OF THAT BOARD- FROM THIS BODY AND THE IMPLICATION THAT SOMEHOW THIS DEAL HAS BEEN- TAINTED OR OVER RUN BY. SOME MAGICALLY POWERFUL SOLAR LOBBY I THINK IS A- A FALSE PREMISE TO BEGIN WITH- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LOVE IF THIS BILL WERE A LITTLE MORE FOCUSED ON. THE FUTURE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND REALLY GETTING. THIS GOLDEN STATE ENERGY. CONCEPTS FOCUSED ON- SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS INTEREST BE THREE FIFTY GOALS ARE BUILDING D. CARBONIZATION GOALS AND I THINK THAT ACTUALLY SHOULD BE IN THE FOUNDING CONSTITUTION OF. WHATEVER THIS ENTITY IS SHOULD EMERGE BUT SECONDLY. TO ASSUME THAT- WE'VE WE'VE HEARD IT JUST REPEATEDLY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ABOUT THIS. POWER THE SOLAR LOBBY AND I WOULD JUST. SUBMITTED YOU STACK UP THE OIL AND GAS LOBBIES. COLLECTIVE FIRE POWER IN THIS TOWN AND MANY ACROSS THIS WHOLE COUNTRY AND I WOULD SAY. THE SOLAR LOBBYIST DWARFED IN COMPARISON SO TO THE I JUST HAVE TO MAKE THAT POINT OF ORDER BECAUSE IT ACT YOU CAN'T LET THAT THAT KIND OF POSTURE- BE UPHELD TOO LONG HERE. YEAH WE RATE PAYERS ARE GOING TO BENEFIT BECAUSE OF OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE IMPLICATION OTHERWISE IS A MISNOMER SO. LISTEN I ALSO I THINK THE BILL COULD GO A LITTLE FURTHER IN THAT SORT OF DIRECTIONAL- PURPOSE TO REALLY ALIGNED WITH OUR CLIMATE IN RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS BUT I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE USING THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. AS THE ENTITY TO REALLY BE THE BACKBONE OF THE BONDING- AND THE FINANCING SIDE BECAUSE WE JUST IN DOUBT THEM ALSO WITH NEW AUTHORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO. FINANCING CLIMATE MITIGATION SO I ACTUALLY THINK THERE COULD BE SOME REAL IMPORTANT SYNERGIES. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE TO DE RISK THIS WHOLE SYSTEM FROM A CLIMATE FUTURE THAT IS HERE SO I WITH THAT'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR STERN MEMBERS WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE MAJORITY LEADER SENATOR HERTZBERG THEY WERE INJURED OVER TO CENTER BAD. SOME INJURED FOR SURE SIR. YEAH I JUST TO. TAKE A MOMENT IN INCOME TO BUILD UPON. THE POINT SINCE SENATOR STIRRED RAISED. THE SITUATION WHERE FRAZIER IT'S NOT SITTING DOWN AND SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DEVELOP PUBLIC POLICY FOR HOW WE DEAL WITH INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. OUR CIRCUMSTANCES INFORMED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT. JUDGE ONE TALI WHAT HIS DECISION IS WHICH BASICALLY IS PAY CREDITORS NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT RATE PAYERS NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE JUST MAKE SURE CREDITORS ARE PAID THAT'S THE ROLE OF BANKRUPTCY JUDGES. AND LAST YEAR WHO SENATOR DODD AT THE HELM. WE CAME UP WITH A PRETTY ELEGANT SOLUTION AS IT RELATES TO FIGURING OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS BALANCE OF CHALLENGES. BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE FRAMEWORK IN SO MANY WAYS. MAKING SURE THE STATE TAXPAYERS ARE NOT ON THE HOOK. AND SO NOW THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY THAT SENATOR HILLS BILL I THINK ADDRESSES IN A REALLY WHAT GOOD WAY. IS HOW DO YOU CREATE IF A AN AVOIDANCE OF A THIRD BANKRUPTCY. HOW DO YOU DO THAT. WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICES SENATOR HILL HAVE DONE HERE IS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THE WAY THAT GIVES US AN OPTION. WHERE THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE BUT THE RISK OF THAT ALTERNATIVE IN A STATE THAT HAS ARMED. THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION LAW. IS THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO BE A HUNDRED CENTS ON THE DOLLAR ON THE HOOK FOR EVERY SINGLE. TRAGEDY THE CURSE RATHER THAN THE RATE PAYERS OR THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THESE COMPANIES. AND SO WHAT SENATOR HILL DID HERE IN THIS BILL. WAS TO FIGURE OUT AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT I KNOW THAT CENTER STERN ADDRESS IT BUT I WANT TO ACCENTUATE THE POINT. OF HOW DO YOU CREATE THAT INTERREGNUM THAT PERIOD WHERE YOU HAVE SOME OTHER ENTITY THAT COULD TAKE THE AUTHORITY AWAY. FROM THE EXISTING INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. WITHOUT IMPOSING LIABILITY ON THE ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IN VIEW OF. THE ROLE OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. THE ROLE OF SENATOR DODD'S BILL. AND THEN FIGURING OUT YOU HOW YOU HAVE AN APPROPRIATE LEVERAGE IT IS NOT. BY SITTING DOWN AND READ DRAFTING HOW WE'RE GONNA DO. A UTILITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M TOTALLY AGAINST UNTIL E FIX INVERSE CONDEMNATION ANY PUBLIC OWNERSHIP. OVER WHAT WE HAVE A UTILITIES BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING TO RESULT IN HUGE LIABILITY TO TAXPAYERS. ON TOP OF ALL THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE ALL THE SERVICES WE'VE GOT TO PROVIDE. HOUSING AND ALL THE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS WE GOTTA DO AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO SUFFER THIS RISK IT MAKES NO SENSE SO I. I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT STATEMENT ON THE RECORD. I THINK THAT- THE ARCHITECTURE WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS INTEGRATED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER MEASURES AGAIN. FRAMEWORK IS SENATOR DODD. AND I THINK SENATOR HILL IS DONE A GREAT JOB. IN THIS REGARD NONE OF THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BUT IF IT HASN'T I WOULD ENTHUSIASTICALLY MOVE THE MEASURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT WILL BE OUR FORMA MOTION WE HAVE A FORMAL MOTION ON THE FLOOR WE SAW OF COMMON BY MEMBERS. THAT MOTION IS GOING TO BE THE SIMPLY AMENDMENTS WILL BE CONCURRED IN. THE BEFORE WE GET TO THAT WE'RE GOING TO NOW TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR BRADFORD GOOD MORNING SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR. THE POLICE TO INTERESTING DEBATE WHEN IT COMES TO ENERGY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I STAND HERE PROBLEM IN A VERY UNIQUE POSITION- AND PRIVATE THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT HAS WORKED IN THE TELEPHONY INDUSTRY AS WELL AS INVESTOR OWNED. UTILITY AND OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE'VE HEARD A VARIETY OF IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE IMPROVE TELEPHONY. IN THIS STATE AND THIS COUNTRY HIGH WE IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY. AND MANY TIMES THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE CLUELESS AS TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE DELIVERY. OF THOSE RESOURCES IN THOSE PRODUCTS. A WISE MAN ONCE STATED. IF ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL CAME BACK TODAY. HE WOULD NOT ONLY RECOGNIZE COULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE TELEPHONE HE WOULD NOT A USER HI. BUT IF THOMAS EDISON CAME BACK TODAY HE WOULD CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY WHETHER IT'S- HYDRO WHETHER IT'S GAS WHETHER IT'S RENEWABLE. BECAUSE IT HAS IT EVOLVED THAT MUCH OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THAT YOU CAN MAKE RADICAL CHANGES BUT THOSE RADICAL CHANGES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN INTERNET TELEPHONY INDUSTRY WAS NOT DRIVEN BY LEGISLATURE. OUR LEGISLATION IT WAS DRIVEN BY CONSUMERS. AND FAR TOO OFTEN WE FIND OURSELVES TRYING TO LEGISLATE A INDUSTRY THAT MANY OF US HAVE VERY LITTLE IDEAL. A HOLLYWOOD OPERATE. I WILL STAND HERE NOT DEFEND. THE UTILITIES BUT TO STATE THAT THE BEDROCK OF WHO THEY ARE. THERE FOUNDATION. IS CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY THOSE ARE THE THREE PRONGS OF EVERY INVESTOR OWNED A MUNICIPALLY OWNED. UTILITY THAT I'VE EVER INTERFACE WITH. CUSTOMER RELIABILITY WORK RELIABILITY I MEAN SAFETY AND RELIABLE SERVICES. BUT MANY TIMES WE PER POLLS CHANGES TO INDUSTRY. AND WE DON'T FACTOR IN THE COST. GIRLS ARE WHAT WE SAY THERE WILL BE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF IMPACT IF THIS IS TURNED OVER TO A NONPROFIT AND AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHO PAYS FOR. MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS UP BOTTLES BUT HERE TO SAY THAT'S NOT THIS AUTHOR HERE. BECAUSE I HAD A OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH HIM DURING THE SAN BRUNO CRISIS. WHEN I CHEERED UTILITIES IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND WE WERE ADAMANT ABOUT MAKING SURE THEIR RATE PAYERS DID NOT PAY FOR THOSE COSTS HE'S BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE ON IMPROVING. SERVICE AND RELIABILITY BUT I HAVE TO STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH SOME MY COLLEAGUES THE BILL PGA PGA ANY IS BEYOND REPAIR BOB TO STRONGLY BELIEVE A DISAGREE OBEY FEEL THAT THEIR SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR WE ARE TODAY. A LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE LEGISLATURE A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH YOU SEE AND THEIR FAILURE TO OVER OVERSEE ARE YOU STILL LAB DURING THE DURING A RAID CASES EVERY THREE YEARS AND I WOULD SEE ALL THE STUFF THAT UTILITIES POLITY INTO THEIR RATE CASING AND WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO. THEY WOULD ASK FOR THE MOON AND SETTLE FOR THE STARS BECAUSE THEY DO YOU SEE WAS GONNA GRANT THEM PRETTY MUCH ALL WHAT THEY WANT WITH NO OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT AND NO CHECKS. AND ACCOUNTABILITY. SO WE ALL OWN A LITTLE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY YEAR. BUT TO SIMPLY SHIPPED. SHIP THE P. DNA FROM INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY TO A NONPROFIT. I'M FOR THAT. I'M FEARFUL BECAUSE AN I. Q. OF WORK FOR NONPROFIT. WORK OF ONE OF THE BEST MOST RELIABLE NONPROFIT IN THE STATE OF NOT THIS COUNTRY BUT TO SAY I'M READY TO TURN OVER UTILITY COMPANY TOOK NONPROFIT I'M NOT SURE I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ALLOWS OUR SHAREHOLDERS THE OWN SOME RESPONSIBILITY. BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WE CANNOT IGNORE THE EIGHTY FIVE LIVES THAT WERE LOST DURING THE WILDFIRE. PLEASE ANY HOUSE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT. AND IF THEY CAN'T SOLVE THAT PROBLEM YES WE NEED TO HELP THEM SOLVE THIS THERE IS NO WAY THE TAKEOVER PGA ANY WITHOUT CREATING AGAIN SIGNIFICANT REPAIR COST. BUT THE COST OF INACTION IS FAR MORE COSTLY. SO I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY I WILL SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION BUT I WILL SUPPORT IT WITH GREAT CAUTION AND OPTIMISM AND MAKING SURE THAT IT LIVES UP TO. MAKING SURE THAT IS THE CORE WHAT. WE NEED FROM THE UTILITY AGAIN MANY TIMES WE'VE SUGGESTED THE REGULATION WE SAW WHAT THAT GOT US LEGISLATION. WE SAW THE DEREGULATION OF THE PHONE COMPANY SOME FORTY YEARS AGO ONLY TO RE CONSOLIDATE BECAUSE THEY REALIZED A BUNCH OF BABY BILLS DID NOT WORK. EROSION OF RELIABILITY AND SAFETY AND THE UTILITY INDUSTRY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH DEREGULATION THAT WE PASSED IN THE LATE EIGHTIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'VE A ROAD IT CUSTOMER TRUST. IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE SUGGESTION OF MUNICIPAL STATION I WAS WORKING WITH FOR A VESTER ON UTILITY WHEN MANY CITY SAYS WE'LL DO IT OURSELVES WITH LITTLE OR NO EXPERTISE AND RUNNING A ELECTRIC COMPANY IT WILL SOON SEE I'M NOT HERE TO PREDICT DOOM AND GLOOM BUT WE'RE GONNA SOON SEE CCA'S ARE ILL EQUIPPED. TO RUN A UTILITY COMPANY THE REALLY IT JUST A THIRD PARTY PURCHASER POWER. WITH NO INFRASTRUCTURE NO FINANCIAL BACK. OF STRUCTURED. TO WARD OFF OF. GOING TO BANKRUPT IF THEY GO INTO BANKRUPTCY OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS SO THE RESPONSIBILITY IS STILL FALLS ON THE UTILITY IT FALLS ON INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY THEY'VE DONE A GREAT WORK DESPITE MANY OF THE CHALLENGES AGAIN WE CAN'T CONTROL MOTHER NATURE. BUT WE CAN'T DO A BETTER JOB OF REGULATING THEM AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ADHERE TO ALL THE PROMISES THAT THEY PUT IN THEIR GENERATE CASE EVERY THREE YEARS WE CAN HOLD THE P. YOU SEE. MORE ACCOUNTABLE. BUT REGARDLESS OF. WHAT WE DO HERE. WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T COME BACK TO THIS POSITION AGAIN. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER BRADFORD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE WE LIKE TO GO TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY FINAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS IT LIKE TO BE ADVANCE. ANY FINAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS.

THE EAST IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AT THE TIME- MY GOOD FRIEND WAS THERE FOR THE COMMUNITY WAS THERE FOR ME. WE HELD A COMMITTEE HEARING THERE AND HE'S BEEN FIGHT IN STRONG AND I AGREE WITH EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID. IT'S NOT JUST THE UTILITY THAT TO FALL. WE HAD THE AND THAT PUTS THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THIS BODY AS WELL. BECAUSE THOSE P. UC COMMISSIONERS WHO FAILED US OVER THE YEARS. WERE CONFIRMED BY THIS BY WITHOUT THE PROPER OVERSIGHT TO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS AND I DO HOPE THAT WE NEVER HAVE TO USE THIS LEGISLATION THAT WE NEVER SEE GOLDEN STATE ENERGY BECAUSE IF WE DO THAT MEANS A P. JEANNIE FAILED TO GET. SO I HOPE WISH AND PRAY THE P. JEANNIE PROVIDES THAT RESILIENT. UTILITY THAT SAFE UTILITY UTILITY WITH A REASONABLE RATES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS. IN THAT WE NEVER HAVE TO UTILIZE THIS PLAN BE.
