TODAY WE HAVE- TWENTY SIX BILLS ON THE AGENDA HOWEVER FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE. HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR FOR TODAY'S HEARING. BEFORE WE HEAR PRESENTATIONS ON THE BILLS LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WE HAVE A CORE. WE DO NOT YET- SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE WILL- BEGIN AS A- COMMITTEE. ABOUT ITS COMMITTEE SKEWS ME- JUST WE'LL JUST BEGIN- AND THEN WE'LL- CALL- CALL ON THE BILL SO- WHY DON'T WE ASK ASSEMBLYMEMBER CELLO- GOOD MORNING SIR BEFORE WE BEGIN I WANT TO QUICKLY SUMMARIZE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON THE AMENDMENTS WOULD DELETE MOST OF THE REQUIREMENTS ON VENDORS. AND INSTEAD ENCOURAGE VENDORS TO INCLUDE AN ASSESSMENT REPORT FOR THE USE OF THAT EIGHTY S. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A COMPREHENSIVE INVENTORY OF ALL HIGH RISK EDA USED DEVELOPER PROCURED BY THE PUBLICATION SEES THESE AMENDMENTS ARE SUMMARIZED ON PAGEFOURTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS COMMITTEE STAFF IS ALSO PROVIDED MOCKUP AMENDMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBER STAFF- THE SURVEY NUMBER TELL YOU MAY BEGIN WITH FILE ITEM TO AB THIRTEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS FIRST FALL IN MAY BEGIN BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR WORKING WITH US SO THE LAST FEW WEEKS ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL- AB THIRTEEN WOULD SET FORTH CRITERIA FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF HIGH RISK AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS UP BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF ADVERSE AND DISCRIMINATORY IMPACTS RESULTING FROM THEIR DESIGN AND APPLICATION. THE USE OF ALGORITHM DRIVEN AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS OR EIGHTY S. CAN ASSIST WITH CREDIT DECISIONS EMPLOYMENT SCREENING INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY MARKETING AND DELIVERY OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES JUST TO NAME A FEW HOWEVER A PULLEY DESIGN ET ESSES CAN ALSO CREATE UNFAIR BIASED AND INACCURATE RESULTS CAUSING DISPROPORTIONATE HARM TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHILE ALSO UNDERMINING TRUST IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. THEREFORE WHEN IT COMES TO ACQUISITION OF THE SYSTEMS BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WE MUST EXAMINE THE STATE'S PROCUREMENT POLICIES GOVERNMENT ENTITIES NEED TO CONSIDER IMPORTANT POLICY CHOICES INHERENT IN MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS INSTEAD OF TREATING PURCHASES AS NORMAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING DECISIONS WHICH SOLELY FOCUS ON PRICE BIDDING PROCESS INNOVATION AND COMPETITION. THEY SHOULD ALSO EXAMINE THE GOALS THAT I. AND RISK INVOLVED IN SENSE. OTHERWISE GOVERNMENTS MAY FAIL IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET THE PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS OF OVERSIGHT OF OUR GROUP MAKE DECISION MAKING AND MAY INADVERTENTLY CREATE NEW REST ALL HARMS. LET ME SHARE SOME EXAMPLES WERE POORLY DESIGNED AND POORLY UNDERSTOOD PUBLIC SECTOR OFFERING MAKE. SYSTEMS HAVE CAUSED HARM TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IN MICHIGAN IN AN EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION WRONGFULLY ACCUSED FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OF FRAUD FORCING MANY OF THEM TO PAY HEAVY FINES. DECLARE BANKRUPTCY OR HAVE THEIR HOMES FORECLOSED UPON. AN ARKANSAS MEDICAID RECIPIENTS LOST ACCESS TO HOME CARE NURSING VISITS AND MEDICAL TREATMENTS BECAUSE OF ERRORS IN HAND IN ERIC INACCURACIES IN AN AUGER THEM. IN DETROIT A MARKET ANALYSIS OTHER THAN USED TO DIRECT PUBLIC HOUSING SUBSIDIES TAX BREAKS AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT RE DIRECTED CRITICAL FUNDING AWAY FROM DETROIT'S POOREST AND PREDOMINANTLY BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT IS REPORTED THAT CALLED WRITERS IN CORRECTLY TRANSLATED POLICY INTO CALIFORNIA'S AUTOMATED PUBLIC BENEFITS SYSTEM KNOWN AS CAL WIN CAUSING OVERPAYMENTS UNDERPAYMENTS AND IMPROPER TERMINATIONS OF PUBLIC BENEFITS. FOR INSTANCE CAROLYN DENYING MEDICAID TO FOSTER CHILDREN IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW. I RECENTLY OPERATIVES HAVE BEEN USED IN THE ALLOCATION OF VACCINES SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH CLEAR GUIDELINES ON HOW TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAINED THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEMS SPECIFICALLY AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AND COMEDIAN ALICE'S AS A TECH LEADER BY CHERRY SELL. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO ONE IDENTIFY WHICH EIGHTY S. S. ARE HIGH RISK AND INTENDED TARGETS OF THE BUILD TO CONDUCT AN INVENTORY OF ALL HIGH RISK EDS IS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR OR ARE BEING USED. DEVELOP OR PROCURE BY PUBLIC AGENCIES THREE ENCOURAGE A PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTOR TO SUBMIT AN AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT OR SIMPLY A I. EIGHT TO EVALUATE THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY RISKS TO PERSONNEL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND RISKS THAT MAY RESULT IN AN ACT. YOU NOT ONLY THE INADEQUATE UNFAIR AND BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS IMPACTING INDIVIDUALS FOR REQUIRED THE STATE AGENCY AWARDING A CONTRACT TO PROVIDE A COPY OF THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE ACCESS TO THE RESULTS IN A ABLE TO CORRECT. OR OBJECT TO THE RESULTS AND FINALLY MAKE THE REPORT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ON LINE TO THE DECIDES TO DO SO. AS NOTED BY THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM GOVERNMENTS DO NOT HAVE THE LATTER TWO OF USING THE BLACK BOX ALGORITHMS THAT INCREASINGLY CHARACTERIZED LOGARITHMS DEPLOYED IN THE MARKETPLACE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEMS DO NOT CREATE NEW HARMS BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK. TO THE LEGAL RIGHTS HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF INDIVIDUALS OR OTHERWISE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN UNFAIR UNITED IN ADEQUATE. INACCURATE BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK SIMPLY- MA'AM- I BELIEVE YOU I ADMIT AND MOVE ON TO ANYONE TO WANTING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE- VINCENT LEE ON THE COASTLINE TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT. OPERATOR CAN WE PUT- THERE. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE PROCEED. L. R. GOOD MORNING CHECK NUMBERS- YEAH AS AS NOTED MY NAME VINCENT LEI FROM THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE WHERE MY JOB IS TO ENSURE THAT TECHNOLOGY WORKS TO CLOSE THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP AND BUILD ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. THE USE OF A. I. IN GOVERNMENT IS EXPELLING. YET% ONLY 30% OF AMERICANS ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS UP TO THE TASK OF MANAGING A- THEY'RE PICKING UP ON IT SOMETHING MENTIONED HERE TODAY THERE'S A DISTINCT LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN THE GOVERNMENT. ESPECIALLY AROUND THIS ISSUE. DID YOU DID IN FACT TAKE WHAT HAPPENED IN MICHIGAN. AT THE TIME LIMITS HOW DATED OVER FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WRONGLY ACCUSED OF UNEMPLOYMENT FRAUD. BUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IN BALCOMBE COPPER STATE FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PURCHASE AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTER. WITH A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT THE HEAD OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT AGENCY WAS FIRED MICHIGAN HAD A RETURN SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE AFFECTED. AND THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS. THE AGENT IN CHARGE OF MANAGING THE SYSTEM AT LITTLE OR NO IDEA HOW THE ALGORITHM WORKS OR WHAT WENT WRONG. YOU HAVE. TO TEST IT WOULD HELP PREVENT THE BALCONY. AND IT SHOWS WHY WE A THIRTEEN. WE DON'T WANT THAT IN CALIFORNIA AT THIRTEEN AS A WAY TO BUILD TRUST IN A. I. IN OUR INSTITUTIONS IN A WAY TO PROTECT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE BEING HARMED BY EDS. AN INCORRECT ASSUMPTION OR FAULTY AND BIASED. THE PUBLIC TRUST IS ALL THEMORE IMPORTANT AS WE SEEK TO MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE GOVERNMENT SERVICES. THEIR PROPOSAL TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT UNDER THE BETTER TERM AND PATIENT ACCESS TO CARE. ALL AGENCIES INCLUDING THE FACT THAT MEN ARE TURNING TO SOLUTIONS LIKE BOB DOT A. I. TO CONNECT COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH HOUSING VOUCHERS. BUT PRECLUDE COMMUNITY TRUST THEN THE POLLUTION ARE LOT LESS VIABLE WE CAN BEAT IT AS WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWENTY FIVE. WHICH BANNED LAW ENFORCEMENT- USING PRETRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL ENTIRELY BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HAD LOST TRUST IN THE. SYSTEM WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN ELSEWHERE. EIGHTY THIRTEEN AND MUCH SUCH A- OF MEDIA IT ONLY APPLIES TO GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT AND ONLY IN INSTANCES WHERE THE RISK OF AN IMPACT OF AROUND AT THE JUNIOR HIGH. VERY SMALL NUMBER OF VICTIMS. BUT PETER CRITICAL SYSTEMS THAT DETERMINE ACCESS THE BENEFITS MEDICAL CARE EMPLOYMENT OR HOUSING. FURTHERMORE THE EIGHTY THIRTEEN IMPACT ASSESSMENT ONLY AFTER HELPERS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS TO THINK THROUGH WHETHER THEY'RE A I COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. HOW TO MEET HIM IN HOW TO MINIMIZE THIS RISK. BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE DISCLOSED TO PUBLIC AGENCIES AS A MATTER OF COURSE IN ANY EVENT. AND IT'LL HELP THEM MAKE WELL INFORMED PROCUREMENT DECISIONS. ITS REQUIREMENTS ARE MINIMAL BURDEN AND WILL NOT PRECLUDE BUSINESSES FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS. FINALLY WHAT AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE WE HAVE FURTHER NEAR THE BUILDING IMPACT ASSESSMENT OPTIONAL MALL ADDING IN A KEY REQUIREMENT THAT WE TAKE STOCK OF EXISTING HIGHER THE DAY I AM CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO NOTE THAT DOWN THE OPPOSITION MAY NOT BE SATISFYING AND OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER ALTERNATE AMENDMENT. THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW AGENCIES TO GIVE. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO BETTER THAT HAPPENED HE DID IT IN PRACTICE. WE FELT THAT THE HOW THE LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AGENCIES THAT BENTLEY TO IGNORE IMPACT ASSESSMENT. OF BUILDER PUBLIC DUTIES OR HELP BUILD PUBLIC TRUST THAT THE ARMY DECISION. THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR OUR FAIR AND UNBIASED AND FINALLY I WILL NOTE THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR HIGH RISK A I'M I REQUIRE. INFLATED LIKE THE TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CANADA. WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA MIGHT FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS AND TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE FROM INACCURATE OR BIASED HEY I JUST SENT. IN FOR THESE REASONS. I RESPECTFULLY AFTER I BOOKED.

YES YOUR HONOR. BUT THEY CAN SURE MEMBERS ARE WE'RE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB THIRTEEN AS WE BELIEVE IT IS AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX BILL THAT WILL DISRUPT THE STATE PROCUREMENT PROCESS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WITH THIS BILL IF THE OVERBROAD DEFINITION OF AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEM WHICH APPLIES TO ANY COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS THAT IS USED TO SUPPORT HUMAN DECISION MAKING A MATERIALLY IMPACTS PERSONS. THE EXCEPTION UNDER THE BILL READS IN RELEVANT PART ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT YOUR DECISION MAKING AND LIST EXAMPLES THE EXCEPTION IS EFFECTIVELY A RESTATEMENT OF THE DEFINITION FOR THE WORD NOT INSERTED INTO IT THIS CONFUSING LANGUAGE CREATES- THAT EXTANT EXTREMELY CHALLENGING SITUATION TO IDENTIFYANY COMPETITION PROCESS BUT BOTH SQUARELY INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE DEFINITION IT'S CONSIDERED AN AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXCEPTIONS WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL INCLUDING THINGS LIKE CALCULATORS AND SPREADSHEETS. OTHER THAN THESE ITEMS THE BILL COULD APPLY TO EVERY SOFTWARE IN USE TODAY. FIRST DAY. SUBJECT TO THIS BILL WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO CONFIDENTLY DETERMINE WHETHER THIS EXCEPTION IS INTENDED TO APPLY TO A CHAT BOT ON A WEBSITE. SO CREDIT APPLICATION FOR BENEFITS FOR STANDARDIZED TESTING SYSTEM. THE SAME CHALLENGE PLUS BUSINESS OWNERS WERE BIDDING ON STATE CONTRACTS AND TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF IT YES. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE BUSINESS TO AUDITED SYSTEMS AS A PREREQUISITE TO SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTING A BID. AND A CONTRACTOR CANNOT AFFORD TO FOR PAY SOMEONE TO. BE DENIED PARTICIPATION IN THE STATE PROJECT BIDDING PROCESS THE BID. NOT TO CONSIDER. FOR COLLISION SHARES NOBLE OBJECTIVE OF COMBATING BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION BUT AB THIRTEEN EVEN AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. IT'S NOT A SQUEEZE THESE CONCERNS WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MOHAMMED- IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN THE GALLERY WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS- IN OPPOSITION.

AND MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTICIPANT CANADA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHE DIED- THIS DROP MODERATOR THANK YOU- THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOW BRING THIS BACK TO FOR DISCUSSION FOR THE MEMBERS ANY MEMBERS WISHING TO. RAISE ANY ISSUES QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SO- THANK YOU SIR MY MEMBER CHOW FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS BILL. FROM BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ISSUES. THAT I HAVE- ONE BEING THAT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE COST PROHIBITIVE FOR- A NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE VETERAN OWNED AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES TO THE POINT WHERE. THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS TYPE OF REPORTING WHICH MEANS WE'E GOING TO BE USHERING CORPORATE IS CORPORATISM INTO. THIS ARENA AND PUSHING OUT THE LITTLE GUY AND I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THAT- THE- THE OTHER ONE IS I GUESS. ISN'T IT I GUESS THE PROBLEM WITH THESE BUY SEEDS IS MORE- THE PEOPLE. DEVELOPING THESE PROGRAMS AND PUTTING YOU INSERTING THIS TECHNOLOGY INTO THAT IT DETECTS. OR INTERPRETED BY SEASON CERTAINLY IT'S NOT THE MACHINERY ITSELF IN OTHER WORDS NOTHING AND NUTS AND BOLTS IT'S THE PEOPLE. BEHIND IT AND I'M NOT SURE YOU SEE THAT. THE BILL ADDRESSES THAT WOULD YOU CARE TO- COMMENTER CLARIFY THAT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTIONS US SENATOR I THINK- ANYTIME WE TALK ABOUT THE COST OF A PRODUCT FOR EXAMPLE. A WE SHOULD DEFINITELY ARE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT WHEN STATE AGENCIES PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS OR SYSTEMS ARE EDS SYSTEMS. AT A COST THAT IT WOULD BEEN CURVE TO THE GENERAL POPULATION IF THE SYSTEMS CONTAIN ANY BIASES OR DISCRIMINATORY. IMPACT HE HAD PROBLEM WITH. SOME OF THE SYSTEMS IS THAT THEY OPERATE AS BLACK BOXES NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT GOES INTO THE BLACK BOX. AND THEY USE THESE SYSTEMS MOSTLY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS THEY PUT DATA IN THAT THEY PUT BIG DATA SO TO SPEAK ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ANALYTICS. AND THEY PRODUCE AN OUTCOME THAT WOULD HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS. THE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW THE SYSTEMS NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY DO. AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS TO SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THESE BLACK BOXES AND THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT THAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO IS ESSENTIALLY. TO HOW INTEL IS WHAT THESE SYSTEMS DO HOW THEY OPERATE WHAT THE PICK A CAPABILITIES ARE WHAT THE LIMITATIONS ARE AND WHETHER OR NOT TO DISCRIMINATE WILL CREATE BIASES. YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK A LOT OF THESE DECISIONS GOOD COLIN. ARE FROM HUMAN BEINGS SIX SIX PEOPLE HAVE BIASES IN GENERAL BUT WE- WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS TO ACTUALLY ASK HIM TO TELL US WHETHER OR NOT THE SCHISMS CREATE BIASES. AND HOW WE SHOULD ALSO ARE YOU KNOW ANALYZE IT FROM THE STATE AGENCY'S PERSPECTIVE FOR EXAMPLE IF A STATE AGENCY WANTS TO PROCURE A SYSTEM THAT WILL PUT TEN. POTENTIALLY IMPACT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR PRODUCT ALL THE PRODUCTS ARE AND WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO IN ORDER NOT TO CREATE BIASES AND DISCRIMINATION ON YOUR P. O. ON ON THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND EXAMPLES. THAT I GAVE EARLIER FOR EXAMPLE TO MICHIGAN SENERE. WERE HE ARE UNDER THE AGE OF SYSEM. FOR THOUSAND PEOPLE. US BENEFITS B. TWO B. ALL IMPACTED NEGATIVELY AN- ACCOUNT. WHAT RESULTED WAR S. ACE WHO YOUR SERIES OF LAWSUITS AND- THAT YOU KNOW WERE BROUGHT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT ENDED UP HAVING TO PAY A LOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO BASICALLY SETTLE THESE LAWSUITS SO THAT'S ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF THE FOUR EXAMPLES SO. SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW THE COST FACTOR YOU'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT DID PREPARE IS IN AND- AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE LONG. RANGE THE RISKS INVOLVED ALSO. I HOPE THAT YOUR QUESTION. WELL YOU YOU CERTAINLY PROVIDED SOME USEFUL INFORMATION I DO APPRECIATE THAT ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT WE PUT A FINER POINT ON THE ISSUE OF IT BEING COST PROHIBITIVE TO SOME OF THE SMALLER BETTER KNOWN TO MINORITY BUSINESSES BUT- BUT I APPRECIATE- YOUR RESPONSE TO SOME WOMEN THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. THE SENATOR FROM LAGER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I TOO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND I CAME IN LATE FROM ANOTHER HEARING SO- I MAY HAVE MISSED. SOME OF THIS BUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. DO THAT AND AMENDMENTS AMENDMENTS MANDATE THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT OR JUST ASK FOR I. WASN'T CLEAR IF IT REQUIRES IT OR NOT I KNOW WELL WITH THE AMENDMENTS THE VENDORS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE THESE REPORTS THEY ARE ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE THEM ONTO THE STATE AGENCIES ACCORDINGLY. SO WHAT WHAT END UP HAPPENING IS THAT STATE AGENCIES OR STATE CDT IN PARTICULAR WILL COME UP WITH GUIDELINES AND ABOUT THESE ATS SYSTEMS FOR VENDORS TO COMPLY WITH AND THEY WILL ALSO COME UP WITH A SAMPLE FORM IF THEY SO DESIRE TO SUBMIT THESE IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT. SO ESSENTIALLY THEY ARE THEY ARE- THESE ARE VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE- AS OPPOSED TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL WHICH MANDATED COMPLIANCE. RIGHT SO IF. THEY DON'T COMPLY AND DECIDE NOT TO USE THE GUIDELINES. THEN WHAT HAPPENS THE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR THE GOAL IS TO HELP IDENTIFY. MAYBE THE BIAS SEES IN THESE AI SYSTEMS BUT IF YOU HAVE ANDERS AND DECIDED NOT TO COMPLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT MANDATORY FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OUTCOME OF NOTHING HAPPENS TO THE OUTCOME- WE SIMPLY ENCOURAGING A DC YOU KNOW STATE AGENCIES TO- TO LOST AND CREATING THE VENDORS TO. TO PROVIDE THESE REPORTS TO THE STATE AGENCIES WHEN THEY ARE. ON A PARTICULAR CONTRACT OUT FOR EXAMPLE TWO HERE'S ANOTHER OPPONENT THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE TO THE AMENDMENT THAT IS THE INVENTORY PEAS SO UNDER THE AMENDMENTS OF C. T. IS SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE INVENTORY OF ALL THESE VIDEO SYSTEMS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE OR INTEND TO PURCHASE I'M SO THAT WAY WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. THE UNIVERSE IS OUT THERE. ON SO THAT WE COULD TAKE ACTION ACCORDINGLY. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN- YOU KNOW I'M GLAD THAT ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED- I GUESS ONE OF THE SUPPORTERS MENTIONED APPROX TWENTY FIVE AND THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND. THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSITION BECAUSE OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND- THE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE USED IN THOSE ASSESSMENTS. AND THE POINT WHICH I THINK- MIGHT HAVE BEEN RAISED EARLIER AND I CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT. IS THAT- YOU KNOW ALGORITHMS ARE. FROM A PURELY ANALYTICAL- SPACE ARE UNBIASED BUT IT'S THE CODERS WHO ARE CREATING THE ALGORITHMS THAT INTEGRATE THE BIAS OF THE PREJUDICE INTO THE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE THEN USED AND THEN YOU KNOW PURCHASED BY GOVERNMENTS PEOPLE CONSUMERS X. CETERA. AND HOW DOES THIS GET BACK THAT AND THE REASON WHY I ASK BECAUSE ACTUALLY BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ARTICLE THAT JUST CAME OUT THIS MORNING THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TECH INDUSTRY AND A KNOWLEDGE AND HOW INCREDIBLY HOMOGENOUS- THE INDUSTRY IS LESS THAN 1% OF FOLKS WHO ARE CODING. ARE IN FACT AFRICAN AMERICAN AND SO IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO CREATE EQUITY IN THESE KINDS OF A. I. SYSTEMS THAT THEN WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE DEPENDENT UPON DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING TO DIVERSIFY. FROM AN ETHNICITY FROM RACIAL FROM A GENDER LENS THANK THE FOLKS WHO ARE ACTUALLY CODING. AND IN FACT NOW THAT WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A SPACE WITH HYBRIDIZED- WORKPLACES WHERE YOU CAN WORK FROM HOME THERE'S ACTUALLY NO NEED TO OPEN UP A COMPANY IN PROBLEM AND AN INTEGRATED CITY AND THEN HIRE FROM THAT WORK FORCE WHICH WOULD ENSURE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE AN INTEGRATED- WORKFORCE WORKING FOR YOU. SO DOES GET OUT THERE BECAUSE I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH PROGRESS ARE WE MAKING YOUR FOR INVENTORYING. INFORMATION VERSUS THE PROGRESS WE COULD MAKE IT FOR ACTUALLY TRYING TO IMPACT HOW CODES ARE BEING DEVELOPED WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CODING. AND THEN HOW THOSE PURCHASES HAPPEN. YEAH THOSE ARE EXCELLENT OBSERVATIONS OF MR IF I MAY DO FOR THE QUESTION TO- MY WITNESS WHO HAS MORE EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA TO RESPOND TO THESE- OBSERVATIONS. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU YES HELLO THE IMPACT THAT THAT DOES HAPPEN THE COMPANY'S IT IS AGAIN OPTIONAL- IT DOES ASK THE COMPANY THERE AT THE MEETING IT WHAT PROPERTIES THEY HAVEN'T PLAYED- OR POLICY THAT THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT BUYERS ARE INACCURACY OF THEIR A. I. SYSTEMS THE DEADLY BEING YOU KNOW A COMPANY THAT HAS A DIVERSE SET OF FOLDERS WE'LL BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN THEIR IMPACT ASSESSMENT- AND YOU KNOW THEY COULD ALSO TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE TESTED THEIR SYSTEM- AND ALSO. I THINK A KEY PART OF WHAT THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT DOES HE HELLO THE DEBATE AGENCY WHAT IS- THAT DEVELOPERS CONCEPTION OF FAIRNESS HOW DO THEY DEFINE THE POLICY ON HOW WE TREAT A FAIR DECISION. AND IMPORTANT EVENT IN IN IN WHEN YOU'RE PREPARING TO DEFEND ITS GONNA AFFECT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND THEN TO YOU IN ADDITIONAL POINT IS THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED THAT OUR CLIENTS AREN'T HOT IT IS JUST THE DOCUMENTATION PARTS OF SMALL BUSINESSES MY ONLY MINORITY ON ONE VETERAN ON ONE CAN FILL OUT THE IMPACT INVESTMENT JUST FINE AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MANDATE ANY EXPENSIVE. AUDITING OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AND GENDER COME ALIVE OR- Q. THAT DOES ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. SENATOR BETTER THANK YOU THAT INCIDENT AND I KNOW WE TRIED TO CONNECT ISSUE DID NOT- I WANTED TO ASK ME ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS. THEY HAVE PROCUREMENT DEPARTMENT WHOSE JOB IT IS TO EVALUATE. ALL TYPES OF SOFTWARE. WHY IS THIS BILL NEEDED IN YOUR MIND. WHAT THE FOCUS IS ON THE- HIGH RISK APPLICATIONS ARE THAT ARE BEING DEPLOYED BY STATE AGENCIES AND CD T. INTERN IS T. ORGANIZATIONAL AGENCIES AGENCY THAT ON THAT OVERSEES THE PURCHASE OF I. T. PRODUCTS IN GENERAL- AND WHICH IS THE REASON WHY WE'RE ASKING C. D. T. TO CONDUCT THE INVENTORY. OF ALL THE SO BASICALLY THESE ARE I. T. PRIDE OF PROJECTS. RIGHT BUT I MEAN. YOU SHOULDN'T DATE PARTY I MEAN WE'VE USED CAR LOTS OF SOFTWARE FOR LOTS OF IMPORTANT. PRIORITIES FOR THE STATE AND SHOULD THEY ISN'T BASICALLY THEIR JOB TO TAKE ALL THESE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT ANYWAY RATHER THAN CREATING ANOTHER REPORTING. THE SITUATION IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE RAISED MIGHT BE PROBLEMATIC FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND OTHERS RIGHT I THINK GOD. WHEN IT COMES TO PROCUREMENT PROCESS I THINK THERE THERE ARE STILL SOME UNIFORMITY AMONGST ALL THE STATE AGENCIES BUT YET THERE ARE SOME DEVIATION. AS WELL OF IT VARIATIONS AS WELL SO- YOU KNOW US SOME AGENCIES MAY REQUIRE REPORTING OF CERTAIN FEATURES ABOUT THE PRODUCT LINE OR WHAT THE DEAL TO. SEE YOU KNOW THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO BASICALLY CREATE UNIFORMITY ALSO- PENA BY WAY OF CREATING THAT FORM THAT SAMPLE FORM THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN IN THIS BILL. WELL I RECKON A JUDGE JOSEPH MYSELF I APPRECIATE THE VERY MUCH THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION HAVE. WORKING LEGAL TECH I'VE SEEN YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE CASES OF BIAS AROUND- PAROLE AND THINGS LIKE THAT THE- THAT SOME DECISIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN- YOU KNOW HOWEVER I THINK YOU JUST. HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AROUND THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THIS AND WHETHER YOU CAN IT'S NEEDED AS MORE PEOPLE ARE JUST REALLY SHOULD BE JUST DOING THEIR JOBS TO EVALUATE THE SOFTWARE. SO PROBABLY LAYING OFF. AT THIS TIME BUT I'M OPEN TO SUPPORTING IT DOWN THE ROAD. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OBSERVATIONS OF MEMBERS. THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT. THREE NINE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE A SEVEN MEMBER THE WHOLE. WELL THERE IS. HE RECOGNIZED ME YEP. THE CHAIRMAN YES IT IS A MY OPPORTUNITY. GO AHEAD OKAY SENATOR GLAZER THANK YOU- WELL I HAVE A COUPLE THINGS FIRST- SEVEN AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO US YOU KNOW THIS IS AN AREA THAT I'M NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH SO I'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A LEARNING CURVE AND REVIEWING YOUR BILL AND IT ALSO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO. LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- IN GENERAL TERMS YOU KNOW I I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF TECHNOLOGY AND- YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE CRITICISMS OF GOVERNMENTS. ONE OF THE PLACES THAT I THINK WE ALL RECEIVE SOME LEVEL OF CRITICISM IS THAT WE'RE NOT EFFICIENT IN WHAT WE DO. WE'RE NOT SPENDING TAXPAYERS MONEY AS EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR SEEMS TO DO THEIR WORK BETTER THAN WITHIN WE CAN WITHIN GOVERNMENT. AND SO I- IN GENERAL TERMS THAT YOU KNOW. I LOVE THE TECHNOLOGY- THAT WE CANNOT DEPLOY IT CERTAINLY THAT. THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD HERE IN STATE GOVERNMENT IS THAT. IN IN THE AREA OF I. T. WE SIMPLY THESE SEEMED TO NOT REALLY BE ABLE TO GET A PROJECT DONE ON BUDGET. ON TIME- AND- THAT CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM- AND I AND I WOULD NOTE THAT SOMETIMES. IT'S NOT ABOUT BIAS IT'S JUST A MISTAKE. I MEAN IT AND MISTAKES WERE MADE ALL THE TIME. BYE BYE DUBAI HUMAN PEOPLE ALL THE TIME AND WE AS A LEGISLATURE STRIVE TO TRY TO. DEAL WITH THAT AND THAT'S CERTAINLY- DO OUR BEST TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION IN ANY FORM AND PLACE THAT WE COULD NEVER FIND IT- BUT I DO WANT TO. ASK YOU WHEN THE WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM VETOED THE SOLACE BILL CREATING AN I. T. POSITION IN STATE GOVERNMENT. TWO YEARS AGO HE HE SAID HE HE WHAT HE PUNTED THE ISSUE. TO THE COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION HE SAID I AM HIS VETO MESSAGE THAT THEY'RE EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE- AND- I WONDER IF YOU'VE HEARD ANY FEEDBACK FROM THAT COMMISSION IN THIS SPACE THAT COULD ENLIGHTEN US. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE COMMISSION PER SE ALTHOUGH WE- HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE CDT- AND- WE'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THEM ABOUT THE BILL ITSELF AND- WE WANTED TO SEEK THEIR OPINION AS TO. WHAT HOW THEY SEE THE BILL SHOULD PROCEED- SO THAT IS STILL ONGOING- ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION ITSELF WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT I YOU KNOW I. HI I GUESS TWO THINGS THAT THE SUM UP WHERE I AM NOT ON THE ISSUE ONE IS I THINK THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE CHAIR IS OFFERED- CREATING PERMISSIVE AND PERMISSIVE- LANE I THINK IS A GOOD MAN AND I KNOW IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANTED- BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT IS A THAT IS AN INCREMENTAL STEP AHEAD THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE. AND FINALLY I WANT TO NOTE THAT IN YOUR WITNESS TODAY TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC TRUST. AND I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE IMPORTANT TOUCHSTONE AND ALL THAT WE DO HERE THE LEGISLATURES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- THAT WE EVER IN THAT PUBLIC TRUST IN ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE AND SAY- AND I DO THINK THAT THIS- KNOWLEDGE IS THAT. THE CARE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IN THE SPACE OF BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION- AND IT'S FOR THOSE REASONS THAT I'M NOT. GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THANKS FOR THE REPORT DO YOU KNOW. THAT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT OBVIOUSLY WANT TO SEE HOW IT. PROGRESSES THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND- RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REVISIT THAT BUT I'LL GIVE A COURTESY VOTE TODAY. VERY GOOD. AND THE OTHER MEMBERS WITH ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR ALAN JUST TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF BY MYSELF WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE I KNOW THESE AMENDMENTS YOU'VE TAKEN- I THINK REALLY DO- ADDRESS A LOT OF THE CORE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BY MY OPPONENT SO I CERTAINLY MINUTE ASHA COMFORTABLE VOTING. TO PUT IN A POSITION TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. WE HAVE CENTER GLACIER THANK YOU. NONE IS JANET HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WHICH WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE TIME YOU DO HAVE A MOTION IT WOULD BE LIKE TO GIVE SIR CLOSE IT'LL ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHILD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN ALLOW ME TO CLOSE TODAY'S DISCUSSION BY RESPONDING TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I FIND INTERESTING THE OPPOSITION STATEMENT AT ITS STAND STRONGLY AGAINST NEGATIVE BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION BUT HAS MADE NO EFFORT WHATSOEVER TO PROVIDE US WITH SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OR INDUSTRY PRACTICE PRACTICES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS INSTEAD OF CONTINUOUSLY POINTS OUT THE DEFINITION OF ADS IS BEING OVERLY BROAD WHICH WOULD NARROW SUBSTANTIALLY TOO ONLY HIGH RISK APPLICATIONS SO HE NOW ARGUES THAT THE DEFINITION OF HIGH RES IS NOT CONFINED TO THE HIGH RISK APPLICATION AS NOTED EARLIER THIS BILL DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF A TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY WHICH EDS IS OUR HIGH RISK AND INTENDED TARGETS OF THE BILL. NOW THIS REGULATORY PROCESS WILL ALLOW STAKEHOLDERS. TO PROVIDE THOUGHTFUL ANALYSES TO. IMPLEMENT- IF THIRTEEN AND IT THE BILL ASKED TDP TO LOOK AT INTERNATIONAL HIGH RISK FRAMEWORKS IN DEVELOPING THESE REGULATIONS WHICH CAN INCLUDE E. U. RUSE. THAT CLEARLY LIST WHAT IS CONSIDERED HIGH RISK ARE THE RHYTHMS. HI RICH EXAMPLES INCLUDE ASSISTANCE AT A SALVAGE PRIORITY INTO DISPATCHING OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND CRIME PREDICTING ALGORITHMS JUST TO NAME A FEW. IT ALSO PROVIDES INDUSTRY WITH HARMONIZED STANDARDS SOMETIMES IT IS ALWAYS. UP LOOKING AND ASKING FOR THE MORE WE HAVE ASKED THE OPPOSITION TO PROVIDE. THEIR PREFERRED DEFINITION OF CHANGES THAT AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY TODAY. DESPITE THIS WE ADDED THESE EXCEPTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THEIR CONCERNS AND REMAIN OPEN TO ANY SUGGESTIONS. INDUSTRY HOUSE IN CLARIFYING ANY OF THE TERMS OF FINES AND BIGGIE WAS TO BE GO ON TO STATE THAT A. B. THIRTEEN INCREASES BERIA TO BID. FOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RISK EXCLUDING SMALL BUSINESSES FROM THE PROCESS OF FACT IS ALL BUSINESSES MAKING BIT. HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA REQUIRED IN THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT. THE INFORMATION SOUGHT ONLY REQUIRES THE BUSINESS TO DESCRIBE THEIR POLICIES AND THINK THROUGH THE IMPACTS OF THEIR SYSTEMS AS A WAY. TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO MAKE BETTER INFORMED DECISIONS AND DOES NOT PRESENT A HIGH BARRIER TO ENTRY. DISTORTION THAT WE- ADAPT WE REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO AUDIT THEMSELVES AND DO NOT PROTECT PROPRIETARY AND TRADE SECRET INFORMATION IS ALSO INACCURATE. THE ASSESSMENT ONLY I ASKED BUSINESSES WHETHER THEY HAVE CONDUCTED ANY AUDIT SO A TASK ON THEIR HIGHWAY SYSTEM. BUT IT'S NOT MANDATED TESTING AND THE BILL SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE TO DISCLOSE TREES SUCH STATE TRADE SECRETS. IN THE END IF THE UNDERLYING ASSERTION IS THAT WE ARE PLACING ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INDUSTRY TO APPLY FOR CONTRACTS. THEN YOU REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS TO IS TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED BY PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTORS. FOR THE- TASK AT HAND THE UNRUH CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AS SOLID ESTABLISHES THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS. ARE FREE AND EQUAL REGARDLESS OF. SPECIFIED TOWARDS. SO ANY TO IN. AND A MAN THAT'S THAT QUALITY IS BY DEFINITION NOT SUITABLE FOR ANY TYPE. CARRIED OUT BY THE STATE NOR DOES IT NEED STANDARDS DISTASTE SHOULD HOLD FOR THE- USE OF TAXPAYERS MONEY FINALLY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL WILL DRIVE UP THE COST OF GOVERNMENT WHICH I EXPLAINED EARLIER. HOW FROM A VALUE STANDPOINT IT COULD AND SHOULD BE ARGUED THAT THE COST TO COMMUNITIES THIS ADVANTAGE. BY DISCRIMINATORY TECHNOLOGY FAR OUTWEIGHS THE ADDITIONAL COST TO THE STATE. SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN. THE MOTION BY SENATOR GLACIER IS BEFORE US THIS BILL WOULD BE MOVED AS AMENDED THEN TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

SO TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB FOR TWELVE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ADVISORY BOARD TASKED WITH REVIEWING THE STATUS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE PROTECTION AND ADVANCEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A CORNERSTONE OF GOVERNMENT. ALTHOUGH OTHER AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING ISSUES MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES FACE THERE IS NO CENTRALIZED ORGANIZATION THAT LOOKS AT THE OVER ARCHING HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. EIGHTY FOUR TWELVE COULD CREATE A FORMAL TATE ENTITY THAT IDENTIFIES HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES CONCERNS FOR SHORT OR SHORT COMINGS INCLUSIVE OF THE INTERSECTION OF VARIOUS FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION. CONSIDERING THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES THE NEED TO ENSURE RECOVERY IS DONE IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER AND THAT MOVING FORWARD THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL ARE PROTECTED IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. EIGHTY FOUR TWELVE WOULD CENTRALIZE THE CONVERSATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND BRING TOGETHER LEADERS EXPERTS AND LEGISLATORS TO EXAMINE THE STATUS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. AND PRODUCE REGULAR REPORTS THAT CAN BE UTILIZED TO GUIDE POLCY. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS AMBER SHEET FROM CARE CALIFORNIA AND JOSEPH SUAREZ SUAREZ.

AN ARRAY OF COMMUNITIES RENEWING CONVERSATION DROPS STOMACH BARRIERS. AND IDENTIFYING AN ARRAY OF COMMUNITY AT THE END AND IN MANY CASES CONTINUE TO BE FOR KARNATAKA CRACKS. MAKING A REPORT. ALL OF THIS MAKES EIGHTY FOUR TWELVE TIMELINESS SUBSIDY WHICH PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR IMPERATIVE HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER CONVERSATIONS. AND POLICIES WHICH- TOO MANY. CONTINUE TO FALL THE CRACKS OF BLACK REPRESENTATION OF POLICY CONSIDERATIONS OFTEN DEALING WITH THE HARSH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT THEME PARK CONSTRUCTION AND IMPLEMENTATION. AND THERE'S NO ENTITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHOSE SOLE TASK IS TO REVIEW THE RIGHT THE CALIFORNIANS ACROSS SECTORS AND JUST- IN ORDER TO ADEQUATELY MITIGATE GOODNESS WHEN THAT. EIGHTY FOUR TWELVE WOULD PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR INCREASED PARTNERSHIP AND DIALOGUE ACROSS THE STAGE AND SERVE AS A KEY ADVISORY ROLE IN IDENTIFYING THESE JOBS. AND HUMAN RIGHTS CENTEED SOLUTIONS FOR MOST OF THE MARGINALIZED IN CALIFORNIA. SERVING AS AN ENTITY WHICH WOULD BE MADE UP OF HUMAN RIGHTS XPERTS FROM CALIFORNIA DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THE COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS CAN CONNECT ACROSS SECTORS AND SYSTEM CALIFORNIA TO IDENTIFY AND TACKLE LARGER. SCALE SYSTEM WIDE ISSUES WHICH IMPEDE ON THE RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT AN ENTITY IN CALIFORNIA TALKING HUMAN RIGHT TO THE LAND AND MANDATES THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK TO PROTECT. ITS BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND LEAD THE NATION IN THE PROTECTION THE ELEVATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS WITH THE REASON THEY'RE ACTUALLY- DRIVE OKAY THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.

A STATEWIDE ENTITY POPULATED BY EXPERTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO TARGET THESE ISSUES AS THEY ARISE WILL BENEFIT ALL RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES.

I HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY A BILL AB THREE THREE EIGHT A MEASURE TO BRING FORWARD THE VOICE OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE ON AN ISSUE OF MISTREATMENT AND IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT OF A HORRID PAST OF THE STATE'S HISTORY ONE THAT BROUGHT ATROCITIES AND GENOCIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. VERY LITTLE OF CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN SLAVERY DURING THE MISSION PERIOD IS CAPTURED IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS. THE SPANISH MISSIONARIES AND THE MILITARY SUB DUDE AND ENSLAVED CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS TO FORCED LABORS AND DISPLACED FAMILY MEMBERS IN THEIR QUEST TO COLONIZE THE ALREADY INHABITED CALIFORNIA. THE MENTALITY THAT CARRIED FORWARD TO THE STATE'S EARLIEST LEADERS WITH THE FIRST GOVERNOR SETTING PAID BOUNTIES TO FORM MILITIAS AIDED AIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- EMBARKED ON A DELIBERATE POLICY OF GENOCIDE AS DEFINED BY POST HOLOCAUST HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNALS. FATHER SERRA SERVES AS THAT CONSTANT REMINDER OF THAT ERA OF VIEWING CALIFORNIA INDIANS AS LESS THAN HUMAN. SOME ARGUE THE FATHER SERRA SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY TODAY'S VALUES HOWEVER IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX FRENCH MAYBE CAPTAIN JEAN FRANCIS DE GAULLE UPON ARRIVING IN MONTEREY BAY. WAS APPALLED BY THE MISSIONARIES ABUSE OF NATIVE AMERICANS RIDING CORPORAL PUNISHMENT IS INFLICTED ON THE INDIANS OF BOTH SEXES WHO NEGLECT THE ACCESSIBILITY AND MANY SINS WHICH IN EUROPE. ARE LEFT TO DIVINE JUSTICE IN HERE IN MONTEREY THEY WERE PUNISHED BY IRONS AND STOCKS THAT WAS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX. IN A TWENTY FIFTEEN POPE FRANCIS HIMSELF APOLOGIZE FOR THE MANY GRAVE SINS COMMITTED AGAINST THE NATIVE PEOPLES OF AMERICA AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS. WITH ME TODAY ARE TO TRAVEL CHAIRS TO GIVE THEIR VOICE TO THIS PROCESS TODAY A VOICE THAT WAS INTENTIONALLY LEFT OUT OF THE PROCESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN. WITH ME TODAY MISTER CHAIRMAN TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS CHAIRWOMAN REGINA CUELLAR OF THE SHINGLE SPRINGS RANCHERIA TRIBAL GOVERNMENT AND CHAIRMAN HEY SUSE TO WRANGLE OF THE WILTON RANCH RANCHERIA TRIBAL GOVERNMENT. CHAIRMAN TARANGO ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES I AM PLEASE PROCEED SIR. A DIFFICULT TO BE UPSET THE SUIT BUT- GERMAN DOT AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PACERS TARANGO NOT DETERMINABLE RANCHERIA I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT. IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAMES RUMBLES IN THE FIVE SPONSORING TRYING ON THE SUPPORT LEGISLATION. MY TRIBE HAS INHABITED THE AREA NOW KNOWN AS THE SACRAMENT OF VALUE. VALLEY THE TIME IMMEMORIAL MY ANCESTORS FOUGHT TO PROVIDE THE GENOCIDE THE CALIFORNIA INDIANS CAUSED BY THE SPANISH MISSIONARY SYSTEM. THE MEXICAN AND AMERICAN MILITARY INCURSIONS AND THE NEWLY FORMED CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. THAT I SIT HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN ONE A BETTER SIR AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS. EIGHTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT IT'S JUST ONE STEP TOWARDS THE RECONCILIATION THE PAINFUL PAST THE INDIGENOUS ME WALK IN THE NOT PEOPLE BUT THE SACRAMENTO REGION. AND THE INDIGENOUS. POPULATION ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. WHAT A BETTER WAS NOT A GOOD MAN. WHILE WE DO NOT KNOW HIS TRUE INTENTIONS. THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS CTIONS ON MY ANCESTORS ARE INDISPUTABLE. GOOD MEN DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE BOOK OF IDEATION OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN. IN AN ATTEMPT TO PURIFY THE BODY TO STAND IN THEIR WAY OF LIFE. GOOD MEN DID NOT BUILD A SYSTEM BY WHICH INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WERE RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES. AND FORCED INTO HARD LABOR FOR A REGION THAT SADDAM HAS SENT HIM. THROUGH THE WHOLE THE ENTIRE NARRATIVE ABOUT WHO LOOKED AT IT THERE AND HE'S WORKING AS A PUBLIC CONSTRAINING. IS ABOUT A MUCH LARGER SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION THE FACT THAT DECIMATE CALIFORNIA'S INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. THE CALIFORNIA MISSION SYSTEM IS WITHOUT A DOUBT A CHAPTER OF THE STATE ISSUE THAT NEEDS TELLING. BUT THE STORY MUST BE ACCURATE. BY REMOVING THE STATUES WE ARE NOT ATTEMPTING TO REWRITE HISTORY. IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE IN FACT WE ARE ASKING THE CALIFORNIA HISTORY BE TOLD IN A TRUTHFUL AND HONEST MANNER. FOR GENERATIONS STUDENTS HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE MISSION SYSTEM AND THE BENEVOLENCE TOWARD INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. THESE WEAPONS INCLUDING FALSE AND INCOMPLETE NARRATIVE THAT NATIVE PEOPLE WERE SAVED BY THE MISSION AND THAT THE RESIDENT THERE WITH MY CHOICE. THESE WEAPONS ALMOST ALTOGETHER DENIED THE INJUSTICE. VIOLENCE AND GENOCIDE THAT OCCURRED AS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA MISSION SYSTEM. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN DESERVE MORE. AS WE LOOK TO BUILD A MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE FUTURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. WE MUST TELL AN ACCURATE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA'S FOUND. REMOVING HER PREDECESSOR AND OTHERS LIKE HIM SUCH AS JOHN STARTER KIT CARSON FROM THEIR ELEVATED STATUS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF TELLING STORIES THAT INCLUSIVE OF ALL PLACES IN CALIFORNIA. ALL TOO OFTEN IN AMERICAN HISTORY THE OPPRESSIVE WRITE THE NARRATIVE OF THE OPPRESSED. WHY IS THAT CHILDREN ACROSS CALIFORNIA CAN EASILY NAME OFF THE THREE SHIPS COLUMBUS FAILED BUT HAVE NO IDEA WHICH TRIBE OCCUPIED THE LAND. IS BACK. LET ALONE ANY OF THE CALIFORNIA INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST ALL ODDS TO KEEP OUR CULTURE. LANGUAGE AND TRADITIONS ALIVE. EIGHTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT TAKES FIRST STEP TOWARD. AN ACTOR HISTORY THE PART OF THE DEAL PEOPLE. BY REMOVING ONE OF THE SERVICE. REMOVING REMINDER OF THE VIOLENT. AGAINST PEOPLE INDIGENOUS TO THE STATE. MY PEOPLE. INSTEAD OF BEING RE. THAT THEIR ANCESTORS WERE VICTIMS OF THE VIOLENCE SYSTEMS START TO STRIP THEM OF THEIR IDENTITY AND CULTURE. WE CAN BEGIN TO TELL A NARRATIVE OF RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY AND THE TYRANT. THAT WILL ALLOW FOR NATIVE PEOPLE. PARTICULARLY YOU. TO FILL OUT THAT THEIR IDENTITY AND VOICES ARE VALID IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. EIGHTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT FUNGAL.

THREE THREE EIGHT PROVISIONS FOR BUILDING MONUMENTS IN HONOR OF CALIFORNIAN NATIVE PEOPLE IN CATHOLIC SOCIAL TEACHING- THE COMMODIOUS BOWLS AND PROVISION AS OPPOSED TO A LIMITING EITHER OR PROPOSITION BOTH MEMORIALS TO NATIVE PEOPLES AND SARAH CAN RESIDE TOGETHER IN CAPITOL PARK AND THERE WILL STILL BE PLENTY OF ROOM FOR HONORING OTHERS. IN CONTINUING TO READ FROM JOHN FAIRBANKS. THANK THE EVILS OF SCRIBE TO FATHER SERRA AND THE FRANCISCAN MISSIONARY MOVEMENT IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ARE MISPLACED SURE HE WASN'T PERFECT AND HIS MESSAGE OF THE VANDALISM OR HARSH WHEN JUDGED BY TODAY'S STANDARDS. BUT OVERALL HE IN THE MISSION OR A FORCE FOR GOOD GOD KNOWS THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS NOT PERFECT THE MELANCHOLY I FEEL WHEN THINKING ABOUT THEIR THE STATUTE IS THIS TRAUMA MINOR CHORD IN COMPARISON TO THE TRAGIC OPERA THE MOTIONS RESOUNDING WHEN I THINK ABOUT OUR CLERGY DIABOLICALLY ABUSING THE INNOCENT SOUL OUT TO PROTECT NEVERTHELESS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS INFINITELY CAPACIOUS. MAKING ROOM FOR SAINTS AND SINNERS A LIGHT WELL NOT INFINITE CALIFORNIA IS CAPACIOUS AS WELL IF WE CAN AND WE WANT WE CAN MAKE ROOM FOR ALL KINDS GOD HELP US IF WE'RE ALWAYS PULLING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER TEARING AT OUR COMMON GENERATIONS FEARING THE OTHER INSTEAD OF BEING CURIOUS AND APPROACHING HIM OR HER WITH AN OPEN HEART. GOD HELP US IF WE CAN'T LAUGH AT OURSELVES AND FIND FRIENDSHIP AMONG CRITICS GOD HELP US RECOGNIZE THE GREATNESS OF CALIFORNIA THE MOST POPULOUS STATE IN THE UNION WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF WHITE SOUL WILLING TO WORK FOR THE COMMON GOOD AGAIN I REITERATE I APPLIED EIGHTY THREE THREE EIGHT. PROVISION FOR BUILDING MONUMENTS IN HONOR OF CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE PEOPLE BECAUSE IN THAT SPIRIT CATHOLIC TEACHING DOES SAY BOTH AND NOT EITHER OR THERE IS ROOM FOR FATHER SERRA IN THE GARDEN AND ALL AND ANY TRIBUTE TO NATIVE PEOPLE AND OTHER GROUPS AS WELL AGAIN I GIVE THIS CREDIT TO- JOHN FAIRBANKS WRITTEN. IN CALMATTERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TIME. NEXT CALL MODERATOR. THERE'S NOBODY ELSE QUEUED UP MISTER CHAIR OKAY THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA- NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION AND- BACK TO THE MEMBER SINCE WE'VE HEARD. ALL THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES. I DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR WAY SO. THANK YOU AND FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO APPLAUD. THE EFFORT TO CREATE A MONUMENT HERE RECOGNIZING IN OUR NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND- WITHIN IT. AWESOME TECHNOLOGY MEANT THAT OF THESE COMMUNITIES WERE DESTROYED THEY WERE ABUSED. OVER THE YEARS- BEGINNING WITH- JUST THE COLONIZATION OF THIS WHOLE AREA THERE WERE ENORMOUS ABUSES AND THAT ONLY SEEM TO GET WORSE AS YEARS WENT BY. AND IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY HAD. ORGANIZED GENOCIDE THAT WAS UNDERTAKEN BY OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENTS I MEAN A BOUNTY WAS PUT ON ON ON THE HEADS OF NATIVE AMERICANS AND THEY WERE HUNTED DOWN. LOOK LIKE. IF AS IF THEY WERE LESS THAN HUMANS AND OFTEN LESS VALUABLE THAN SOME LIVESTOCK AND IT'S A VERY SAD HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE. THAT WE DO SOMETHING HERE IN THE IN THE CAPITAL I HAD ONE A QUESTION ON FROM THE AUTHOR RELATING TO FUNDING AND THERE WAS A WHOLE SECTION THAT WAS STRICKEN ON HOW THIS WAS. JUST FROM THE I KNOW THE WAY THINGS WORK IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. I WAS I WAS HOPING THE STATE COULD PUT SOME MONEY BEHIND THIS EFFORT AND HELP CONSTRUCT THAT MONUMENT BUT GENERALLY. THIS BILL WAS AMENDED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD JUST BRIEFLY GIVE US A REASON WHY. THE AREA WAS AMENDED IN WHY WE CAN'T PARTICIPATE FINANCIALLY IN THE CREATION OF THIS MONUMEN SO I WOULD SUPPORT THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALOGY OF THE TREATMENT TOWARDS CALIFORNIAN PEOPLE- BACK IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO WHERE WE ARE NOW. BASED ON THE FUNDING ASPECT OF IT THERE WS MONEY THAT WAS SET ASIDE. IN THE BUDGET- TO- MAINTAIN- FATHER SAT AS STATUTE. IT'S THAT PART OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS TAKEN OUT. OF THE BUDGET ITSELF. IN RULES WHEN YOU'RE SIMPLY SIGN OKAY. I WAS TAKEN OVER BY BUT- I MEAN THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THAT BASICALLY REQUIRES THAT THE FUNDING BE PROVIDED BY THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS NEGOTIATED AGREED TO OR WHAT WHAT WE PROPOSE THAT ARE WHY WHY CAN'T WE ENTERTAIN PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THE MAINTENANCE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP- MR SENATOR- THAT PROVISION ALSO WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS- PUT ON IN RULES AS FAR AS THE MAINTENANCE. AND FOLLOWING OTHER MONUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED ON FOLLOWING LANGUAGE FROM THE RONALD REAGAN- STATUTE THAT MOVE FORWARD SO KEEPING EVERYTHING EVERYTHING AND PARITY. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN THAT THERE SHOULD BE FUNDING FOR THAT STATUE IN THE SOMETHING THAT I WILL RELATE TO THOSE THAT ARE ON THE CALL AND THOSE THAT ARE THERE FOR YOUR SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD IN THAT AND I KNOW THE WAY THIS WORKS IF ONE HOUSE AGREES TO THAT AND THERE'S A AGREEMENT MADE THAT USUALLY WE RESPECT THAT. AND HONOR THAT BUT HAS AGREEMENT BEEN MADE I MEAN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S THE WAY IT WILL MOVE FORWARD ON THE RULES COMMITTEE AND SO- UNFORTUNATELY THAT PART OF. OUR I WAS HOPING WE COULD DO SOMETHING AND MAYBE AT A LATER DATE WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS DIFFERENT THIS IS DIFFERENT THERE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. OUR STATE HOUSE TO ATONE FOR OUR HISTORY. AND IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO DO IT THROUGH ACTUAL- US SUPPORT FOR THE CREATION. OF THIS- THE IS A BLANK. IN THE- IT'S IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BILL. AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY IN THE BODY OF THE LANGUAGE AND YOU MENTIONED THAT MONEY WAS TAKEN OUT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. NOT TO MAINTAIN- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT AND DOES THE REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN THE PHONE IF THERE ARE SEVERAL. THE MONUMENT BUT IN THIS BILL. IN THE FIRST PAGE IT IT'S NOT CONTAINED IN THE ACTUAL LETTER PART OF THE BILL BUT THERE IS A REFERENCE SAYING THAT THIS BILL WOULD DELETE THE REQUIREMENT RELATING TO THE- MONUMENT. TO A FATHER COULD BE PROUDER OF SEVEN. THAT WAS ADDED TO THE BILL I MEAN THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL- BUT THAT IS THE ONLY REFERENCE THAT. CURRENTLY THAT I KNOW OF THAT MAKES A REQUIREMENT. THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO CONTINUE- MAINTAINING THE FATHER CONFIGURE SERVER MONUMENT. IS THERE ANOTHER REFERENCE SOMEWHERE ELSE AS FAR AS THE- MAINTAINING IT AND THE- CREATING. SOME TYPE OF NONPROFIT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE MONEY TO PROVIDE FOR THAT MONUMENT AND FOR THE UPKEEP OF IT VISIT OUR OUR DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD. GOING INTO APPROPRIATIONS IT DEALS WITH THE FUNDING COMPONENT OF IT- SO IT DOES HAVE THAT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY- AND NOW WE'RE AT TODAY. YES SIR IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- ALL THE STATUES AND MONUMENTS. I REQUIRE A PRIVATE FUNDING THAT ALWAYS CAN BE CHANGED TO CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT THAT'S- THE INCLUDING THE COOPER SEVEN MONUMENT. YES OKAY BUT OF THIS BILL MAKES REFERENCE TO DELETE THE REQUIREMENT RELATING TO THE MONUMENT OF PUTTING BETTER SIR WHICH IS JUST TO MAINTAIN MAINTAIN MEANS TO ALLOW IT TO BE THERE SO IS IT YOUR INTENT THROUGH THIS BILL TO REMOVE THE CONFEDERATE CENTER MONUMENT. MY INTENT THROUGH THIS BILL IS TO GIVE THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE THAT SPOKE SO ELOQUENTLY ON THIS BILL THE VOICE THAT WAS ABSENT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN IN THE YEARS PRIOR TO THAT WHEN THE MISSIONARY SYSTEM CAME FORWARD THAT VOICE HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD AS PART OF HISTORY OR EVEN THE TRUE FACTUAL ASPECTS OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED YOU'VE HEARD MANY PEOPLE ON THE CALL HERE TODAY TO REAFFIRM THAT SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT GIVING CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. OF VOICE ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT HAS BEEN- RACED THROUGH THE HISTORY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF HAVING THAT VOICE PRESENT SO HE'S A FIGMENT DELETING 20% I WOULD GIVE THEM A VOICE MR- SENATOR WE WENT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN IN YOUR ROOM BUT WE TALKED ABOUT GOING BACK AND FORTH AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE. WAS THAT- A RACING HISTORY AND I DISAGREED WITH THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN PELOSI HAD A COMING UP THERE WAS A WHOLE HISTORY THAT WAS RAISED AT THAT TIME IT'S THAT HISTORY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO LET THAT VOICE TO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT TODAY THESE ARE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS GIVING THE VOICE BACK TO THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE IT'S NOT ABOUT A RACING CULTURE MISTER SENATOR IT'S ABOUT GIVING THEM A VOICE TO THOSE. THAT HAVE NOT HAD THE CHANCE TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD EVEN IN THESE CHAMBERS BY EVEN HAVING THIS DEBATE AND HAVING- SPEAKERS CHIME IN IS THE MOST THAT WE'VE SEEN CALIFORNIA ENDED PEOPLE'S VOICE INVOLVED IN A POLICY MOVING FORWARD TO HONOR THE. ANCESTORS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISS FROM. UP YOU KNOW. THE STATE OF THE- HAS REALLY BECOME. A STORY ABOUT THE- IT'S A STATE THAT HAS PEOPLE THAT HAS BECOME A STATE THAT IS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT HAS PEOPLE FROM ALL. REALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD OF DIFFERENT FAITHS RELIGIONS AND- AS MANY OTHER CALIFORNIANS I HAVE. I SHARE BLOOD WITH MANY OF THE GROUPS I AM NATIVE AMERICAN. I AM OF SPANISH ITALIAN EVEN NASH FOR **** JEW. DISSENT AMONG MANY OTHERS. I BELIEVE. HISTORY IN AMERICAN HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN TOLD IN CORRECTLY. IT'S BEEN TOLD BY INDIVIDUALS THAT CAME TO DOMINATE THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE YEARS I WASN'T A PARTY TO THAT AND I'M NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THAT I THINK THIS BILL COULD HELP US CHANGE THAT. AND WE SHOULD CHANGE THAT. THIS BILL ELIMINATES A REQUIREMENT TO MAIN ONE MONUMENT AND REPLACES IT WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN ANOTHER MONUMENT. AND THE CONSTRUCTORS AND SIGNERS OF THE NEW MONUMENT ARE ALREADY SET- THAT THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN IN FEATURING WHO NEED BETTER SAID ON THAT MONUMENT. AND AN EGG AND EXPRESSLY- YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE. THAT WE NEED TO DELETE PROVISIONS IN OUR HISTORY IT'S- YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY FIGURES THAT OFFEND- DIFFERENT PEOPLE I MEAN WE HAVE ONE HERE IN OUR CHAMBER THAT WAS A SLAVE OWNER AND OF COURSE- YOU KNOW OUR HISTORY. KEN IS VERY DARK AND THERE'S PARTS O THE VERY DARK IN ATLANTA AND THAT THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD A LONG. WITH THE SUCCESSES OF OUR HISTORY AND HOW WE CAME TO BE HERE AND HOW WE'RE ALL HERE. SHEREEN JUST A BROAD RANGE OF. GENETIC HISTORY. THAT IS MADE CALIFORNIA A GREAT PLACE- I THINK THIS BILL CAN. IN MAINE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE COOPER SEVEN MONUMENT AND A NEW MONUMENT TO NATIVE AMERICANS I'D LOVE FOR US TO SUPPORT THAT THISTHIS BILL. COULD AUTHORIZE THE CONSTRUCTION OF NATIVE AMERICAN POT. MONUMENT AND I WOULD I WOULD LOVE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. WITHOUT NECESSARILY. AND I'M NOT SAYING PRESENT ON APRIL SEVENTH- YOU KNOW I I'M JUST THINKING WE SHOULD PRESENT ON JUST LIKE ANY OTHER. A PORTENT HISTORICAL FIGURE I THINK HE WAS IMPORTANT IN HIS TIME. HERE IN THE STATE HE ACTUALLY WALKED BACKED TO MEXICO FROM MODERATE FROM TWO FROM MONTEREY COUNTY TO MEXICO CITY. TO PRESENT A NATIVE AMERICAN BILL OF RIGHTS BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR AT THAT THAT THAT THEN GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA WAS ACTUALLY. HORRIFICALLY ABUSING OF NATIVE AMERICANS AND HE OPPOSED TO IT HE BROUGHT IT UP WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR DID NOTHING TO CONTROL. THE GARRISONS OF TROOPS ORDER WITH- ACTUALLY BE ABUSIVE. AND SO HE WENT BACK PERPER PRESENTED THE BILL OF RIGHTS THEY WERE ACTUALLY ADOPTED. AND THE GOVERNOR WAS ACTUALLY REMOVED FROM POWER BAIT BASED ON WHO THE BETTER SAID US ADVOCACY FOR NATIVE AMERICANS YES. HE WAS INVOLVED IN OTHER THINGS BUT HE ALSO. THE BELIEVED THAT THEY DESERVE TO BE- RESPECTED BEN SO. I THINK THAT THE STORIES TO BE TOLD AND IT AND I AGREE THAT ALL VOICES NEED TO BE HEARD IN THIS TELLING OF HISTORY AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SUPPORTING TODAY. THAT WE- THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE ONE. SMALL PROVISION LIMITED THERE'S A LINE ON THE FIRST PAGE OF SAID THIS BILL WILL DELETE THE REQUIREMENT RELATED TO THE MONUMENT OF CONVERTER SEVEN THAT'S ALL I WOULD ASK. THAT BE DELETED FROM THE BODY OF THIS BILL. THEN IT BASICALLY LEAVES THE ENTIRE BILL INTACT. THE ENTIRE PROCESS AND THE WHOLE OF CREATION OF A NEW MONUMENT AND MAYBE IN FUTURE YEARS WE CAN WORK TO PROVIDE SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THROUGH THE CREATION OF THIS MONUMENT SO THAT IT CAN BE PROMINENT AND SO THAT CAN BE. VERY INSTRUCTIVE IN TELLING THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIAN I'D- I'D I'D MAKE A MOTION THAT- THE BILL MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. AMENDMENT AND- MAYBE ASK- MISTER CHAIR IF THAT'S THAT WOULD BE MY MOTION. IF WHAT TIME WILL WE RESPOND MAKE SURE. PLEASE PROCEED TO SEVEN HOUR THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- SENATOR WESSEL AND IS GLAD TO BE HERE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD IN YOU. AND OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD YOU SHOULD SEE THE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS FAR AS EDUCATING PEOPLE YOU TALK ABOUT. SETTING HISTORY STRAIGHT BUT UP UNTIL THIS POINT HAS BEEN A PRINT TERMINAL APPROACH TO TELLING THE HISTORY THAT SOMEHOW THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO TELL THEIR OWN STORY THAT IT'S A PATERNAL APPROACH THAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST THAT'S HOW THE ONE PEDAL SEALED A STATUE GOT HERE WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS FOR THAT PATERNAL APPROACH TO BE ELIMINATED FROM THIS POINT ON. LET THE VOICE OF THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES IT'S NOT ABOUT SITTING UP HERE TODAY AND TAKING A MEMBER STRAIGHT FROM THE DIETS WHICH I FEEL KINDA HARD STYLE BUT I WILL COMMIT. TO GETTING THIS BILL HERE AS IT IS IN WORKING WITH YOU AND THE SPONSORS IN A ROOM TO TALK ABOUT WHY THERE IS SO MUCH FRUSTRATION WITH THIS SYMBOLISM OF ONE PANACEA IS IT RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO KEEP SOMETHING UP TO BRING SO MUCH HURT AND PAIN AND TORMENT TWO OTHER PEOPLE THAT FIRST INHABITED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT GIVES DUE RESPECT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO LET THEIR VOICE BE HEARD IN A ROOM WE COULD TALK ABOUT THESE AMENDMENTS RATHER THAN PUTTING THEM UP ON THIS FLOOR AT THIS TIME WHICH I DO AS FAR AS- HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE BUT I DO COMMIT TO WORKING TO MOVE THE FOOT MOVE FORWARD THESE ITEMS BUT BRING PEOPLE INTO THE ROOM TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER I. TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD I THINK I TRUCK YOU IN- THINK YOU'RE- YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT. IN I WOULD TO LEAVE A AT THAT THAT'S ALL POSSIBLE THAT YOU AGREE. TO CONVENE A GROUP US WHERE SO. AND OTHERS IN OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO DO. BE IN THAT MEETING TO DISCUSS THIS THIS PORTION OF IT. AND IF THERE'S SOME AGREEMENT THAT COMES OUT OF THAT IT COULD BE. A MODIFIED- YOU KNOW DOWN THE LINE IN APPROPRIATIONS- BUT NOT IN THIS COMMITTEE. THE- SIR GORGEOUS SURELY I COULD FOLLOW UP ON NINE YOUR COMMENTS- PASSIONS CAN CERTAINLY RUN HIGH AND- I ACTUALLY CONVERSATION WITH A CONSTITUENT OF MINE AND THE QUESTION WAS WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE A STATUE OF ATATURK. ARE IN- A PUBLIC SETTING IN THE COURSE OF THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY NOT I WOULD TAKE GREAT OFFENSE TO THAT- BUT MY QUESTION. TO YOU AS YOU PROVIDE INSTRUCTION TO THE AUTHOR ON THE NEXT STEPS IN THE ASSUMING THE AUTHOR AGREES TO THOSE NEXT STEPS IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS BEEN SOME SORT OF COMMISSION OR MONUMENT COMMITTEE. EITHER THROUGH RULES COMMITTEE HERE IN THE SENATE WERE JOINTLY RATHER. THAT LOOKS AT THAT THESE ISSUES IN TOTALITY- THE STATUARY WE HAVE. WE'RE. CALIFORNIA IN ITS GOING THIS WOULD BE ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE I WOULD SUSPECT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THOSE DISCUSSIONS SO WHENEVER YOU DO HAVE- THIS MEETING- MYSTERON MOST. I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU COULD INCORPORATE INTO THAT MEETING THAT YOU HAVE WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THIS- MONUMENT COMMITTEE OR MONUMENT COMMISSION UNDER THE AUSPICES OF- DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES IN THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE. WE'RE WITH THE- IF THEY HAD HAD A REVIEW THIS ISSUE ALREADY BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT VOICE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ON- I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT STATUARY DIFFERENT MONUMENTS IN WANTING TO EXAMINE. DO THEY REFLECT OUR REALITIES TODAY WITHOUT FORSAKING THE BEAUTIFUL HISTORY INS AND OFTEN TRAGIC HISTORY THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD ASK THAT YOU INCORPORATE THAT INTO YOUR STATION SO THAT WHEN HE DOES. FIND ITS WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS PEOPLE CAN SPEAK ADEQUATELY TO THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE OR NOT BEEN. DONE IN THE STATUS OF IT MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU PERMISSION OF A AS CHECK. PLEASE IT'S ME MEMBER IN THE BILL IT IDENTIFY THE DGS WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF- REVIEWING THE PLANT IN APPROVING THE PLANS THROUGH ON THE PROCESS OF JOINT RULES SO THE LEGISLATURE IS INVOLVED IN- BE- THOSE ITEMS OF THE AGENDA AS DURING THOSE MEETINGS.
