00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:08.780
VULNERABLE IN OUR CqC OUR

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.314
SOCIETY ARE.

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:11.949
QUITE FRANKLY RESPONSIBLE I

00:34:12.016 --> 00:34:13.351
THINK THAT.

00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:15.920
WE ALL TRY TO BE ENGAGED AS MUCH

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:18.856
AS POSSIBLE BUT I THINK WE HAVE

00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:20.558
TO STOP TALKING ABOUT.

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:22.527
CHILDREN IN FOSTER KIDS AND YOU

00:34:22.593 --> 00:34:24.262

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:25.830
ITEM IN THE BUDGET.

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.198
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT A LINE

00:34:27.265 --> 00:34:29.901
ITEMS ARE IMPORTANT BUT THE WAY

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:32.470
WE HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS CAMP BE.

00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:34.639
THIS IS MONEY THEREFORE WE'RE

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:35.506
GOING TO DO THIS.

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.542
HAS TO BE THIS IS THE WAY THAT

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:39.877
WE CAN GO BOOKS HELP. TO SUPPORT

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:42.380

00:34:57.528 --> 00:34:59.430
WE CAN SAY THAT WE WANT TO HELP

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:00.898

I ALSO AM A PART OF CALIFORNIA

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:29.080
YOUTH CONNECTION ARE SEE WHY SEE

00:37:29.146 --> 00:37:30.615
A REALLY AMAZING AND INCREDIBLE

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:32.016
YOUTH ORGANIZATION THAT JUST

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.651
PASSED A BILL THIS YEAR AROUND

00:37:33.718 --> 00:37:35.019
STABILITY.

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.021
AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN AND I

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.089
BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I THINK

00:37:38.155 --> 00:37:39.624
THE CONCEPT OF STABILITY IS

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.258
CRITICAL HERE FOR TALKING ABOUT

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:42.660
MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS.

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:43.728
AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:45.296
VERY FOUNDATION OF YOUTH BEING

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.098
SHAKEN AND TORN FROM UNDERNEATH

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:48.933
US AND EVERY MOMENT OF OUR TIME

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.169
IN FOSTER CARE.

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:53.337
IT'S HARD TO HAVE ANY.

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:54.505
ANYTHING ELSE BEYOND THAT AND WE

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:55.740
REALLY NEED STABILITY THAT'S

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:57.375
FOUNDATIONAL AND WITH THE FOSTER

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:59.076
STABILITY CAMPAIGN WE TALK ABOUT

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:00.778
STABILITY IN ALL ASPECTS IT'S

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:02.046
NOT JUST ABOUT PLACEMENT WHICH

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:03.614
WE ACTUALLY CALL A PLACE TO LIVE

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:05.816
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BADS.

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.852
RATE OR A ROOF IT'S REALLY ABOUT

00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:09.987
A SAFE PLACE TO CALL HOME AND

00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:11.288
THAT ALL YOUTH DESERVE THAT.

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:12.823
SO WE ALSO TALK ABOUT STABILITY

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.158
IN SERVICE SAYS AND THAT'S A

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.026
LITTLE BIT WHAT I WANTED TO

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:17.294
SHARE WITH YOU IN MY STORY TODAY.

00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:19.897
ACTUALLY WENT THREE THIRTY TWO

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:20.665
DIFFERENT PLACEMENTS IN THE

00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:22.767
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM I WAS ALSO IN

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.935
JUVENILE HALL SEVERAL TIMES AND

00:38:25.002 --> 00:38:26.737
I WAS ALSO HOSPITALIZED SEVERAL

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:27.605
TIMES.

00:38:27.672 --> 00:38:29.040
I BROUGHT AN IMAGE TODAY THAT I

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:30.641
MADE WHILE REFLECTING ON MY

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:32.176
EXPERIENCE AND I I WROTE A

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:34.812
MANTRA IT SAYS I AM POWERFUL I

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:37.081
AM CAPABLE I AM WORTHY IT'S THE

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:38.349
SYSTEM THAT'S BROKEN.

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.217
AND ON HERE I ALSO WROTE ALL THE

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:42.887
DIAGNOSES SAM AND ALL THE

00:38:42.953 --> 00:38:43.954
MEDICATIONS THAT I WAS

00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:46.190
OFTENTIMES FORCED TO TAKE

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:48.325
PARTICULARLY IN GROUP HOMES.

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:49.160
AND WHILE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:50.261
LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

00:38:50.327 --> 00:38:52.329
PARTICULARLY DUE TO THE BRAVERY

00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:54.098
ADVOCACY OF OTHER FOSTER YOUTH

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.633
WHO COME BEFORE ME.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.101
I KNOW WORKING WITHIN THE SYSTEM

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:59.236
MYSELF THAT FOSTER YOUTH STILL

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.438
SUFFER AND THAT.

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.339
THIS LEGISLATION IS AND ALWAYS

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:04.175
AND FORCED.

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.777
SO IT REALLY WAS NOT HELPFUL FOR

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:09.280
ME GROWING UP I THINK WAS THAT.

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:10.481
MENTAL HEALTH WAS MORE ABOUT

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:12.083
OBLIGATION AND THAT WAS WHAT I

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:14.085
WAS REQUIRED TO DO IT WAS ABOUT

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:15.586
GETTING PUNISHED IF YOU DIDN'T

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:17.154
GO TO THERAPY OR GETTING

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:18.589
PUNISHED IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE YOUR

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:19.657
MEDICATION SO I WAS NEVER GIVEN

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.125
A STRONG SENSE OF WHAT HEALTH

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.226
AND WELLNESS MET.

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.594
AND THAT I WAS ENTITLED TO A

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:25.663
HEALTHY AND SAFE LIFE AND

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.131
HEALTHY AND SAFE RELATIONSHIPS

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:28.632
SO I FOUND THAT ELSEWHERE

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.034
OFTENTIMES ON THE STREETS WHEN I

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:31.635
A WILD AND THEN AGAIN WAS

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:33.204
PUNISHED FOR THAT.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.371
AND I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU ALL TO

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:35.506
DO WHEN THINKING ABOUT MENTAL

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:36.774
HEALTH AND THE FOSTER CARE

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:37.875
SYSTEM.

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:39.977
IS TO SHIFT SERVICE SAYS AND

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:42.747
TARGET THINGS AT THE ADULTS WERE

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:43.347
FAILING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:44.448
YOUTH.

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:45.382
BECAUSE IT CAN BE EASY TO

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:46.851
PROBLEM AT HIGHS AND CRIMINALIZE

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:49.720
YOUNG PEOPLE FOR BEHAVIORS THAT

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:50.755
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:51.989
BUT I CHALLENGE YOU TO TAKE TIME

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.457
TO UNDERSTAND THOSE BEHAVIOR AND

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.226
PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE

00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:56.994
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOU'RE

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:58.295
GOING TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT.

00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:00.030
NO IDEA IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:01.198
YOUR FAMILY AGAIN.

00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:02.733
NO IDEA IF YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.635
TO GO TO SCHOOL AND NO IDEA

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:07.138
REALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE.

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:08.405
LET'S TARGET THE SERVICES

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:10.141
INSTEAD AT THE ADULTS WHO ARE

00:40:10.207 --> 00:40:11.909
FAILING TO RESPOND CORRECTLY TO

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:13.644
THESE BEHAVIORS WE NEED TO TRAIN

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:15.579
CARE GIVERS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:16.947
NOT JUST TO BE TRAUMA AND FORMS

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.482
BUT TO CREATE SPACE AND

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:20.518
OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.720
TO HEAL AND THEIR CARE.

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.922
WE NEED TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:26.323
COMMUNITIES.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.558
CHILDREN TO ENTER FOSTER CARE

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.260
THROUGH FAULT OF THEIR OWN IT'S

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:30.427
OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF FAILURES

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:32.496
OF ADULTS AND OFTENTIMES BECAUSE

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.665
OF FAILURES OF SYSTEMS WE KNOW

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:36.167
THERE'S ENTIRE ZIP CODES I READ

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:37.501
ABOUT AS ZIP CODE IN LONG BEACH

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:39.503
WHERE ALMOST 90% OF THE CHILDREN

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:40.871
HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:42.473
THAT'S A SYSTEM PROBLEM AND

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.341
INSTEAD WE TARGET SERVICES TO

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:45.543
CHILDREN AND PROBLEM AT HIGHS

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:47.378
THEM FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR WHICH IS

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:49.513
THE MOST REALISTIC RESPONSE TO

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.848
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:52.449
WHEN WE SEE BEHAVIORS THAT WE

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:54.718
SOMETIMES LABEL AS OUTBURSTS A

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:56.554
REALLY CONCERNS ME BECAUSE

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.988
FOSTER YOUTH SOMETIMES ARE THE

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.223
ONLY ONES WHO I THINK ARE

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.091
RESPONDING CORRECTLY TO THE

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:02.626
CIRCUMSTANCE AROUND THAT?

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:04.461
THIS IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:06.297
FOSTER YOUTH ARE TRYING TO TELL

00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:08.699
US THAT AND I KNOW I WAS.

00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:09.567
THROUGHOUT MY TIME IN CARE.

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:12.236
I WAS ANGRY AND I ONE WAS

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:13.237
WILLING TO LISTEN TO ME OR TO

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.905
HEAR THAT.

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:17.208
SO I DID OUT SO I HAD OUT FIRST --

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:18.876
I A WILD AND THEN I WAS PUNISHED

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:20.778
FOR THAT BEHAVIOR.

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.279
AND THEN I WAS MEDICATED FOR

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:23.414
THAT BEHAVIOR AND WHAT I DIDN'T

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.248
TAKE THE MEDICATION I WAS

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:26.417
PUNISHED MORE.

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:29.019
AND I FELT VERY LOST AND I'M

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:31.222
FINE TODAY RIGHT I'M IN GRADUATE

00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:32.690
SCHOOL AND I DON'T THINK THAT.

00:41:32.756 --> 00:41:35.025
THAT'S NOT THROUGH JUST MY OWN

00:41:35.092 --> 00:41:36.060
WORK AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE

00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:37.494
THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:38.863
SPECIAL ABOUT ME IT'S BECAUSE

00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:39.697
THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:41.665
SPECIAL ABOUT EVERY SINGLE

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:42.566
FOSTER YOUTH.

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:43.968
WHO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:45.970
REALIZE ON ALL OF YOU TO REALLY

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:49.039
DO YOUR JOB AND SUPPORT THEM?

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:50.507
BETTER THAN WE ARE NOW.

00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:52.009
I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE SOME

00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:53.177
SORT OF PROCESS FOR

00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:54.645
ACCOUNTABILITY PARTICULARLY

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:57.081
AROUND PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION.

00:41:57.147 --> 00:41:58.315
WHICH I STILL SEE TO BE OVER

00:41:58.382 --> 00:42:00.351
PRESCRIBED PARTICULARLY IN

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:01.285
CERTAIN COUNTIES AND I WANT

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:02.686
THOSE COUNTIES TO BE HELD

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:04.388
FINANCIALLY ACCOUNTABLE.

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:05.556
I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT IT'S

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:07.458
NOT OKAY TO IGNORE IN JOKE ABOUT

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:09.593
THE LEGISLATION THAT THE STATE

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.661
PASSED IN ORDER TO PROTECT

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:13.130
CHILDREN.

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.665
I WANT YOU THE VOICE AND CHOICE

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:16.333
TO BE A PART OF EVERY PROCESS.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.735
BECAUSE LEGISLATION WILL MEAN

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:19.069
NOTHING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:20.571
CARE UNLESS IT COMES FROM THE

00:42:20.638 --> 00:42:21.972
YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE.

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:23.307
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:25.075
FIND MEANINGFUL WE MADE LOOK

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.577
FROM THE OUTSIDE AND THINK

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:28.078
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE BUT

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:29.446
THERE MAY BE A ROOT CAUSE THAT

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:30.848
YOUNG PEOPLE I UNDERSTAND BETTER

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:32.950
THAN WE DO WHEN WE GET FURTHER

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:36.287
REMOVED FROM AT SO REALLY WHAT I

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:38.522
WANT TO ASK YOU.

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:40.057
ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND FOSTER

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.825
YOUTH IS TO MAKE STABILITY --

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:43.494
REALITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.597
YOUTH SO THAT YOUTH CAN GROW.

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:49.266
AND LEARN AND DREAM.

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:51.335
JUST AS OTHER CHILDREN BECAUSE

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.837
AS YOU.

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:55.539
SAID EARLIER THERE'S NO SUCH

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:57.174
THING AS SOMEBODY ELSE'S KIDS

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.043
THESE ARE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:01.211
AND I KNOW VERY PERSONALLY HOW

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:02.746
MUCH IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:04.715
BUT I ALSO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:08.585
WE DO NOT ACT SO THANK YOU

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:08.886

WHICH I WOULD HAVE LIKE TO SAY

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:34.211
AND COULDN'T FIT INTO.

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:36.413
MY DISCUSSION AND PROBABLY

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.015
COULDN'T OF SAID AS WELL IN ANY

00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:42.519

LENGTHY LIST OF TOPICS IN THE

THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:58.302
ABOUT.

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:00.270
UP I WANT TO SAY A LITTLE BIT

00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:02.373
ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE RELATIVE TO

00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:04.541
FOSTER CARE AND THE REASONS WHY

00:44:04.608 --> 00:44:05.943
I THINK I WAS ASKED.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.379
TO COME AND TALK WITH YOU --

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:10.414

I WROTE THE BOOK THAT BECAME THE

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:24.028
TAXED FOR THAT COURSE AND I'VE

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:26.096
LEFT A COPY WITH YOU FOR YOUR

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:29.133
USE -- AS I

A NUMBER OF MY CLIENTS WE'RE

FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND OTHERS

00:44:39.243 --> 00:44:41.412
INCLUDING THAT OF THOSE PEOPLE

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:44.014
WERE SURVIVORS OF CHILD SEXUAL

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:47.484
ABUSE AND CHILD PHYSICAL ABUSE --

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.952
I'VE WORKED WITH FOSTER USE

A RELATIONSHIP BASED.

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.995

AND CURRENTLY I CHAIR THE LA

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:02.332
COUNTY COMMISSION FOR CHILDREN

AND FAMILIES AND ALSO SERVED.

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:06.503
ON THE FIRST FIVE LA COMMISSION

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.339
THAT ADDRESSES ISSUES FOR VERY

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:11.475
YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:13.410
SOAK SOME OF THE KEY CONCEPTS

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:15.913
THAT I HOPE YOU'LL KEEP IN MIND

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:17.347
AS YOU THINK ABOUT.

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:18.816
OF FOSTER CHILDREN IN FOSTER

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:21.285
YOUTH AND WHAT YOU MIGHT.

00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:25.355
DO TO IMPROVE THEIR SITUATIONS.

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:26.990
OUR EARLY OCCURRING TRAUMATIC

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:29.326
EXPERIENCES.

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.195
AND DISRUPTION OF SIGNIFICANT

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:33.063
ATTACHMENTS AND THE IMPACTS OF

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.898
BOTH OF THOSE HAVE ON THE

00:45:34.965 --> 00:45:36.633
DEVELOPING BRAIN AND THE

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.235
DEVELOPING CHILD.

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:41.138
AND I THINK THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:43.040
TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:44.808
CUTTING INTO.

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:45.542
ADDRESSED.

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:47.611
OF CHILDREN WHO ENTER CARE HAVE

00:45:47.678 --> 00:45:49.079
ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME KIND OF

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:50.681
TRAUMA WHETHER IT'S NEGLECT

00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:51.882
ABUSE.

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:53.784
SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:55.986
ILLNESS OF APPARENT

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:57.387
INCARCERATION OF APPARENT.

00:45:57.454 --> 00:46:01.291
ILLNESS OR DEATH OF A PARENT SO.

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:03.360
FOR THEM THEM TO EXPERIENCE

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.795
REMOVAL FROM HOME IS ANOTHER

00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:07.197
SERIES OF LOSSES INFORMATIK

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:08.932
EVENTS INCLUDING FURTHER

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.868
DISRUPTION OF WHICHEVER

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:12.436
IMPORTANT ATTACHMENTS EXIST FOR

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.505
THEM.

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:16.840
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:19.376
THAT IT IS THROUGH ATTACHMENT

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:21.011
EXPERIENCES RELATIONSHIP

00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:23.747
EXPERIENCES THAT WE DEVELOP THE

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:26.083
ABILITY TO MANAGE POWERFUL

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.519
EMOTIONS THAT'S KIND OF WHERE IT

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.287
GETS LAID DOWN AND IF WE DON'T

00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:32.055
LEARN IT WHEN WERE LITTLE WE

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:35.292
HAVE TO LEARN IT LATER --

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:37.628
FROM MATIC EARLY EXPERIENCES

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:38.962
HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:40.464
NEUROBIOLOGY.

00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:43.066
IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ORIENT.

00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:46.170
THE CHILD TO DEAL WITH STRESSFUL

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:48.405
ENVIRONMENTS AS OPPOSED TO

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:50.107
POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTS.

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:52.509
AND THIS HAPPENS MOST POWERFULLY

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:54.011
IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:56.980
WHEN. 90% OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

00:46:57.047 --> 00:46:59.016
TAKES PLACE.

00:46:59.082 --> 00:46:59.883
THERE'S A SECOND PERIOD OF

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.418
IMPORTANT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:03.253
DURING ADOLESCENCE AND I THINK

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.689
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY.

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:06.857
THE USE AND OVER USES

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:10.594
PSYCHOTROPIC MADS IS A SPECIALLY --

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:13.697
AT SIRIUS FOR US.

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:15.666
TO BE THINKING ABOUT SINCE THE

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:18.468
BRAIN IS IN ITS SECOND IMPORTANT

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:19.770
PERIOD OF GROWTH.

00:47:19.836 --> 00:47:21.305
AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THESE

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:22.639
MEDICATIONS ULTIMATELY REALLY

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:25.709
AFFECT PEOPLE --

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:27.878
EARLY LIFE STRESS PREDISPOSE

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:29.279
CHILDREN TO BEHAVIORAL AND

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:30.781
DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS THAT CAN

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:33.350
BE LIFELONG.

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:35.118

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:18.348
TRAUMA GRIEF AND LOSS AND 90% OF

00:55:18.415 --> 00:55:19.349
THE SEVEN DAY NOTICE SAYS ARE

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:20.617
THAN REST SEND IT BECAUSE THE

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:21.518
FAMILIES HAVE A BETTER

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:23.353
UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH WHAT THE

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.821
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING.

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:25.789
TO THRILL AND THEIR

00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:27.490
RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT THEY CAN

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:29.225
ACTUALLY DO TO CREATE A HEALING

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:30.994
ENVIRONMENT SO I THINK SEEING

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:32.095
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON A

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:33.363
STATEWIDE LEVEL COULD REALLY

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.031
IMPACT STABILITY FOR YOUNG

00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:35.865
PEOPLE.

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:38.635
AND BECAUSE EVEN WHEN.

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:39.969
FOSTER PARENTS FEEL LIKE GIVING

00:55:40.036 --> 00:55:41.204
UP THEN THEY'RE GIVEN THE

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:42.706
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:45.508
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR ROLE IS

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:47.677
AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO THAT

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:52.449
WHILE RATE.

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:53.550
THAT THAT'S FOR RESIDENTS WITH

00:55:53.616 --> 00:55:55.618
ME WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I WAS

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:57.787
THE YOUNGEST OF FOUR BOYS.

00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:59.989
AND WHEN I WAS IN [inaudible]

00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:01.825
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:05.128
MY PARENTS INVITED A YOUNG MAN

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:06.996
FROM THE SENATOR COUNTY FOSTER

00:56:07.063 --> 00:56:09.566
CARE SYSTEM STAY WITH US.

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:12.035
AND HONESTLY THEY DID NOT KNOW

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:14.237
HOW TO DEAL WITH HIM.

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:15.672
HE WAS DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:16.740
THERE FOR BOYS.

00:56:16.806 --> 00:56:18.808
AND IN A FAIRLY SHORT TIME HE

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.310
WAS NO LONGER IN THE WHOLE.

00:56:20.376 --> 00:56:22.112
AND MY PARENTS WERE GOOD PEOPLE

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:24.147
AND HILL.

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:25.648
TRUST ME.

00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:27.283
RAISING FOR COOLEY BOYS WAS A

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:28.651
LITTLE BIT LIKE BEING A LION

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:31.020
TAMER -- BUT

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:32.222
SOMEHOW THEY DIDN'T REALLY KNOW

00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:34.057
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS YOUNG MAN

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:35.792
AND HIS NEEDS.

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:38.027
AS FOR GAVE UP SO COULD I JUST

00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:39.996
ADD.

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.397
TO A CATALINA'S COMMENTS TO SAY

00:56:41.464 --> 00:56:44.434
THAT ANOTHER WAY OF I THINK

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:46.870
MAKING SOME SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS.

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:51.508
IS THE PRE PLACEMENT FAMILY FOR

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:53.209
JUST THE REASON THAT YOU MENTION

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:54.944
THAT IS IF PEOPLE HAVE DIRECT

00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:57.046
HELP IN PREPARING. FOR THE

00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:58.414
PERSON THERE THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:01.117
COMING TO THEM AND HOW.

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:04.521
THAT RELATIONSHIP CAN BE YOU

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:05.688
KNOW HELP TO START.

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:08.525
IN A GOOD WAY ESPECIALLY.

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:11.861
YOU KNOW IF THAT HAPPENS BEFORE

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.897
THE CHILD IS PLACED.

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:16.099
AND MAYBE DURING THE PLACEMENT

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:18.301
YOU KNOW AT THAT HAPPENS NOW BUT

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:19.569
I THINK THERE IS NOT.

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:22.806
AS MUCH PRE PLACEMENT INDIVIDUAL

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:23.406
SPECIFIC.

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:23.606
WORK.

00:57:23.673 --> 00:57:26.042
OKAY.

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.544
THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU CREEK

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.245
TWENTY YEAH I THINK THAT.

00:57:29.312 --> 00:57:30.547
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:32.282
THE SYSTEM CAN BE VERY QUICK

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:34.484
INCLUDING CARE GIVERS OR

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:36.052
CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES VERY

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:38.788
QUICK TO CALL THE POLICE ARE

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:40.256
FIFTY ONE FIFTY OR PUNISH THE

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:41.558
YOUNG PERSON --

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:44.093
WHEN REALLY THE PROBLEM ISN'T?

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.295
THE PROBLEM ISN'T THAT YOUNG

00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:47.263
PERSON'S BEHAVIOUR IT'S THE WAY

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:48.932
THAT PEOPLE AROUND THEM ARE

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:50.466
RESPONDING TO IT AND IF THEY HAD

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:51.434
PEOPLE AROUND THEM WERE

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:53.269
RESPONDING TO THAT BEHAVIOR MORE

00:57:53.336 --> 00:57:54.838
APPROPRIATELY THEN THE BEHAVIOR

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:55.738
WITH CHANGE.

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:56.940
THAT'S WHAT BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE

00:57:57.006 --> 00:57:58.341
TEACHES US RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.676
WE KNOW ABOUT CHILD AND

00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:01.177
ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT --

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:02.879
IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE

00:58:02.946 --> 00:58:04.013
BRAIN SCIENCE YOUNG PEOPLE

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.282
RESPOND TO REWARDS AND FOSTER

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:07.884
CARE IS A PUNISHMENT BASED

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:10.186
SYSTEM WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE --

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:12.021
HAVE TO EARN GOOD THINGS BUT

00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:13.389
IT'S A LOT HARDER TO EARN A GOOD

00:58:13.456 --> 00:58:15.124
THING THAT IT IS TO BE PUNISHED

00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:16.492
FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:17.627
EVEN REALLY NEED TO DO.

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:18.127
AND THAT'S KIND OF AN

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:20.129
ELABORATION ON YOUR OWN INITIAL

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:22.365
TESTIMONY YOU WERE DESCRIBING

00:58:22.432 --> 00:58:24.367

THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.282
CONCERNS RIGHT BY.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:20.516
WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE GROUP

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:22.118
HOMES I HAD A SITUATION ACTUALLY

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:25.221
MY SISTER WHERE SHE MET A FOSTER

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.423
KID OD TWO WEEKS AGO?

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.958
AND HE WAS --

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:31.761
REALLY SHAKEN UP AND SAYS I HAVE

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.863

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.665
AND IT WAS LIKE SEVEN PM AND HE

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.066
SAYS IF I DON'T MAKE IT HOME BY

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.135
EIGHT I DON'T GET TO EAT.

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:41.904
AND AND THAT IS STILL WITH ME I

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.240
IT'S DISTURBING ME STILL BECAUSE

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.908
I WISH I KNEW WHAT THE KIDS THAT

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.010
YOU KNOW I WISH I COULD DO

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:48.711
SOMETHING --

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.446
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT'S

01:00:50.513 --> 01:00:51.981
SOMETHING THAT IS OUT OF THE

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.784
ORDINARY FROM WHAT I HEARD YOU

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:56.185
TALK ABOUT ITS THE PUNISHMENT

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.353
BASED SYSTEM.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.288
ABOUT WHAT THEY DO AND DON'T DO

AND I WOULD AT SOME POINT YOU

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.794

AND IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:16.639
CAN DO. TO SUPPORT BECAUSE I

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:19.442
ALSO KNOW THAT IN A GROUP HOME

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:22.011
THERE IS YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.946
MORE THAN ONE CHILD PER CARE

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:27.083
GIVER AND SO HOW DO WE SUPPORT

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:29.552
THOSE GROUP HOME --

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:31.254
CARE GIVERS BIG BEING THAT

HOME AND AND YOUR EXPERIENCES

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:35.591

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:36.926
LIKE IT WAS A POSITIVE ONE IF

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.461

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.395
TIMES.

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.897
THERE WAS A REASON FOR IT AND SO

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:43.266
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR OR MAYBE IF

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:45.668

I WOULD TURN TO THE RIGHT SIDE

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:13.936
OF THE FIGURE WHICH SHOWS THE

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.971
NUMBER OF THE RATE OF AT WHICH

THE ON TURNING TO PAGE FIVE THE

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.736
STATEWIDE SPENDING AVERAGES ALSO

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:49.571
DIFFER FOR FOSTER CHILDREN

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:00.249
CAPITA EXPENDITURES ON FOSTER

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:02.184
CHILDREN SO THAT COULD POINT TO

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:03.419
THE FACT THAT --

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.120
FOSTER CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:05.954

A HIGHER NUMBER OF SERVICES.

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:12.828
AND THEN LASTLY JUST NOTE THAT --

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.630
SPENDING ON THE SPECIALTY MENTAL

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.799

TWO BILLION BETWEEN TWENTY

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:29.611
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND TWENTY

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:30.646
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN IS ABOUT 6%

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:31.980
ANNUAL GROWTH RATE.

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:33.916
AND THE RATE OF GROWTH --

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:36.151
IS JUST A A LITTLE SMALLER FOR

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:37.820
FOSTER KIDS BUT PRETTY

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.855

ELEVATED NEEDS ARE WILL NOW BE

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:54.957

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.718
THE WAY THAT THE FUNDING IS

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:24.052
STRUCTURED IS THAT IT SUPPORTS

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:26.288

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:27.008
BY THE COUNTIES ORGANIZATION

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.643

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:32.647
AFTER MYSELF AND SO THAT

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:35.016
PARTNERSHIP IS REALLY CRITICAL --

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:37.852
WE THINK OF OUR PROVIDERS AS US

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:39.821

IS IN THE COMMUNITY AND MY MY

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:53.468
OPINION AFTER BUSINESS IS IF WE

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:54.569
COULDN'T DO COMMUNITY BASED

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.438
SERVICES AND I REMEMBER THE DAYS

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:57.472
WHEN WE DID NOT.

01:22:57.539 --> 01:22:59.407
OTHER THAN CASE MANAGEMENT WE

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:00.975
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE THE

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:02.911
KIDS AS THEY NEED IT AND

01:23:02.977 --> 01:23:05.146
CERTAINLY TODAY AS WE HAVE BEEN

WRAPAROUND WAS MENTIONED.

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:23.031
ALL OF THOSE ARE DESIGNED TO

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.766
ADDRESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.434

IS TRYING TO TAKE A STAB AT

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.644
GETTING THAT CHANGE AND I THINK

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.179
WE'RE MAKING GOOD HEADWAY BUT

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.948
WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING --

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:41.516
YOU'LL HEAR I'M SURE ABOUT THE

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:42.717
GROUP HOME PROVIDERS A

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:44.152
RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS THAT ARE

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.720
WORKING HARD AND MAKING CHANGES

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:48.256
BUT THERE THAT IT'S JUST A START.

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:50.825
SO I'M HOPING THAT --

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:52.594
NEXT YEAR YOU HEAR A VERY

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.263

KATERINA WHO WENT THROUGH THE

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:02.404
SYSTEM.

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.072
QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE I

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:05.473
THINK WE HAVE MADE SOME GAINS

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.675
NOTHING'S PERFECT BUT I WANTED

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:09.511

ARE PROVIDED.

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:20.655

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.301
INTO THOSE SERVICES ARE REALLY

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:08.703
CRITICAL ALONG WITH TVS AND THE

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:09.604
WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT ARE NOT

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:10.939

THAT VERY MUCH INTERACTED INTER

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.609
RELATE SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:17.078
VERY CRITICAL --

01:25:17.145 --> 01:25:18.446
THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE I JUST

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.048
WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT THAT

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:21.349
THAT'S HAVING THAT'S A LITTLE

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:23.318
BITOF A SLOW START AS FOSTER

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:24.118
PARENTS.

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:26.120
IT'S A SCARY THING TO BE A

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:27.822
FOSTER PARENT IT'S EVEN MORE

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.290
SCARY THING TO THINK I'M GONNA

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:30.492
LEARN HOW TO PROVIDE.

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:32.494
MEDICAL SERVICES AND DOCUMENT IN

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.462
A MEDICAL RECORD SO THERE ARE

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:36.064
SOME A LEARNING CURVE THAT'S

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:37.765
GOING ON AND I KNOW OUR FOSTER

01:25:37.832 --> 01:25:39.434
FAMILY AGENCIES IN THE COMMUNITY

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:40.368
ARE WORKING.

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:43.171
ON RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING AND

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:46.107
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THE I

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:47.876
THOUGHT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.110
COUNTRY ON SAID WAS.

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:50.411
IN RELATION TO TRAINING THE

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:52.180
PARENTS IS REALLY CRITICAL TO I

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:52.914
REALLY WANT.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.249
TO ECHO THAT AND THAT IS THE

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:56.184
INTENT OF THERAPEUTIC FOSTER

01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:58.887
CARE THAT IS THE INTENT OF C. C.

01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:00.788
R. WITH RESOURCE FAMILY HOMES

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:02.824
NOW -- IN

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:05.960
THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS TRAUMA

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:07.862
INFORMED CARE AND SO THERE'S A

01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:10.932
LOT OF STUFF A LOT OF NEW

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.635
PRACTICES THAT ARE REALLY BEING

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.136
FOCUSED ON TO HELP.

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:16.538
THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE REALLY

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:17.939
WORKING WITH OUR CHILDREN DAY IN

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.808
AND DAY OUT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ON

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.911
HOW TO TO DO A BETTER JOB.

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.579
SO I WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT.

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:25.880
AND THEN JUST A COMMENT IN

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:27.148
RELATION TO THE DIFFERENCE

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.049
BETWEEN CHILDREN AND ADULTS

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:29.484
SERVICES.

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:31.452
AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED CHILDREN

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:34.055
SERVICES REALLY AND THEN --

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:36.391
MEDICAL NECESSITY DOCUMENT THAT

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:38.993
LOOKS LIKE THIS REALLY TALKS

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:41.963
ABOUT THAT CORRECT RUMELIA RATE.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:45.567
WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT IF THAT

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:48.202
A CHILD BECOMES ELIGIBLE IF A

01:26:48.269 --> 01:26:50.438
SERVICE IF IF FOR THE CHALLENGE

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:51.606
CAN BE CORRECTED.

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.741
OR AMELIORATED THE VERY BIG

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.376
DIFFERENCE THAN FROM A VERY

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:58.046
SEVERE --

01:26:58.112 --> 01:27:01.015
DIAGNOSIS THAT REQUIRES MAJOR

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:03.718
INTERVENTION SIX FAST TO BE

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:05.253
ELIGIBLE AND IF THERE'S NOT A

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.521
BELIEVE THAT THEY'LL BE A MAJOR

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:08.389
TURNAROUND.

01:27:08.456 --> 01:27:09.290
THEN THEY MAY NOT MEET CRITERIA

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:10.758
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IN THE

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:11.960
CHILDREN'S WORLD AND SO WE HAVE

01:27:12.026 --> 01:27:13.962
OPPORTUNITIES. TO DO SOMETHING

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:16.097
VERY DIFFERENT AND THAT IS UP TO

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:17.498
AGE.

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:19.200
TWENTY ONE UP TO AGE TWENTY ONE

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:21.235
SO THROUGH AGE TWENTY SO IT'S

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:22.337
ARE TRANSIENT TRANSITIONAL AGE

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:23.871
YOUTH POPULATION AS WELL.

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:25.306
AND THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:26.841
CHILD WELFARE HAS ALSO BEEN

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:28.476
WORKING VERY HARD WITH SOME OF

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:31.613
THE THB PLUS AND I'M BLANKING ON

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:33.081
WITH THE T. H. P. PART IS.

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:38.453
BUT IT'S REALLY FOR THE I

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:40.355
HOUSING PROGRAM TEACH BE FLAT SO

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:41.289
ANYWAY WORKING WITH THAT

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:43.091
POPULATION.

01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:45.093
AND THEN FINALLY JUST TO COMMENT

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:47.595
ABOUT PRIMARY CARE --

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:51.199
MANAGE CARE UP PLANS AND THE FEE

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:52.533
FOR SERVICE --

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.135
THERE'S LIMITATIONS YOU KNOW

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:56.571
THEY ARE REALLY THE PRIMARY CARE

01:27:56.638 --> 01:27:57.605
PHYSICIAN.

01:27:57.672 --> 01:28:00.241
AND THE ANALOGY I USUALLY GIVE

01:28:00.308 --> 01:28:02.176
IS IF YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF A

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.078
HEART CHALLENGED USUALLY BEGIN

01:28:04.145 --> 01:28:06.047
WITH YOUR PRIMARY CARE.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:06.848
PHYSICIAN YOU BRING AGAIN WITH

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:09.083
YOUR PCP AND IF YOU'RE SHE SAYS

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.251
THAT YOU CAN.

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:11.519
OUTLET MAY PRESCRIBE THERE SIR

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:12.587
LET ME WORK WITH YOU ON THIS

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:13.821
CHANGE YOUR EATING HABITS DO

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:15.223
THIS EXERCISE.

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:16.457
AND YOU CAN BE STABLE YOU'RE

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:17.759
DONE.

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:18.760
BUT IF.

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:20.561
YOU NEED SOMETHING ELSE TO MORE

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.530
SERIOUS YOU NEED TO SEE A

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:23.231
CARDIOLOGISTS THAT YOU GET

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:24.165
REFERRED.

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:26.034
THERE THE SPECIALTY THAT'S WHAT

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.001
COUNTY SPECIAL TEAM AND HEALTH

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:28.670
DOES AND ARE CONTRACTED

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:30.371
PROVIDERS.

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.674
THE SHIFT THAT THAT HASN'T QUITE

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.275
BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL.

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:36.744
IS WHEN YOUR DONE AFTER YOU'VE

01:28:36.811 --> 01:28:38.279
HAD SIR HEART SURGERY.

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:39.814
AND YOU'VE BEEN MONITORED FOR A

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:41.115
YEAR OR SO AND YOU'VE BEEN

01:28:41.182 --> 01:28:42.884
STABLE AND YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:43.551
EATING HABITS.

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:44.585
AND YOU'RE TAKING YOU WERE

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:46.054
TAKING YOUR MEDICATION REGULARLY

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.056
AND THEN YOU STABILIZE AND

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:49.190
YOU'VE DECREASED YOUR MEDICATION

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:50.658
AND I WERE JUST TAKING A BABY

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:51.592
ASPIRIN.

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:54.195
ONCE A DAY YOU GO BACK TO YOUR

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:55.029
PCP.

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:57.098
WE HAVE A HARDER TIME AS AS

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:59.267
CHILDREN AND ADULTS STABILIZE

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:01.069
GETTING THEM BACK TO THE PC P.

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:02.303
BECAUSE ONCE THEY HAD THAT

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.604
DIAGNOSIS.

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:04.639

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:43.337
SERVICES TO YOUTH ON CASE

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:44.672
SPECIFIC NEEDS.

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:46.073
WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL AND

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.074
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE IN

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:50.444
ALL COUNTIES.

01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:51.946
SO WHAT DO COUNTIES NEED TO

01:35:52.012 --> 01:35:53.347
EFFECTIVELY SERVE CHILDREN AND

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:54.682
FAMILIES ESPECIALLY UNDER C. C.

01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:56.117
R..

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:58.619
WE NEED TRUE SHARED LEADERSHIP

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:00.054
FROM THE TO STATE DEPARTMENTS

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:01.155

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:02.323
NEEDS OF CHILDREN YOUTH AND

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:03.591
THEIR FAMILIES.

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:05.993
IN CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION HAS

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.361
A RIPPLE EFFECT ON LOCAL

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.530
AGENCIES AND I SEE THIS FIRST

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.098

01:36:11.165 --> 01:36:12.299
PROGRAMS.

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:14.802
AND THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:16.036
FOR EXAMPLE BOTH STATE

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:17.872
DEPARTMENTS SK FOR SCREENING

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:19.173

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.374
DEPARTMENTS.

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:21.842
THIS WAS DUE ON THE SAME DAY

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:23.043
WITH DIFFERENT REPORTING

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:24.945
REQUIREMENTS.

01:36:25.012 --> 01:36:26.814
CANS IMPLEMENTATION VERY LITTLE

01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:27.882
THOUGHT TO COORDINATING

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:29.550
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES MEANS

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:31.385
DIFFERENT REPORTING DIFFERENT

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:33.354
SETS OF QUESTIONS DIFFERENT AGE

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:34.021
GROUPS.

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:35.489
AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SUPPOSED

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:36.524
TO BE USING THE CANS TO WORK

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:38.125
TOGETHER.

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:40.327
WE NEED A COORDINATED DATA

01:36:40.394 --> 01:36:41.996
SYSTEM AT A MINIMUM.

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:43.464
SO THAT WE CAN JOINTLY TRACK THE

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:44.865

01:36:44.932 --> 01:36:46.467

IS THERE ANY ROLE.

01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:55.422
THAT THE STATE CAN SUPPORTS OF

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:57.358
THE LOCAL LEADERSHIP.

01:39:57.424 --> 01:39:59.026
IN UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES THAT

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:00.260

A COUNTY BUDGET STRUCTURE.

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:10.003
AND IS THERE A WAY IN WHICH THE

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:12.005
STATE COULD BE ASSISTING WITH

01:40:12.072 --> 01:40:12.306
[inaudible]

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:13.440

DISCIPLINARY APPROACH DESCRIBE

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:23.384
THAT SORT OF THING.

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:24.251
SO IT IS SORT OF GENERALIZED

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:25.519
THOUGHTS ON THAT SO NOT

01:40:25.586 --> 01:40:27.621
NECESSARILY STRICTLY SHASTA

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:29.056
COUNTY YOU ALREADY.

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.258
TALKED ABOUT VENTURE ANOTHER

01:40:31.325 --> 01:40:34.027
SHIFT YOUR PERSPECTIVE

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:34.328
[inaudible]

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:36.163
YOU WANT.

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:37.531
OKAY.

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:40.667
SO -- YEAH

01:40:40.734 --> 01:40:42.002
THERE'S JUST THERE'S ALWAYS

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.470
THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH MONEY.

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:45.339
AND WE KNOW THAT --

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:47.608
PROBABLY THE THE I THINK OF TO

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.343
CHALLENGES ONE OF THEM IS THAT

01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:51.478
WE RELY HEAVILY ON MEDICAID

01:40:51.545 --> 01:40:52.379
FUNDING.

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:54.348
AND WITH REALIGNMENT IS WHAT WE

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:56.950
USE THEM USE FOR A MATCH FOR THE

01:40:57.017 --> 01:40:59.153
50% OF THE F. P..

01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:00.854
AND OF COURSE EVERYTHING COMES

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:03.724
IN ARREARS THE ENTIRE MEDICAID

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:07.261
SYSTEM FOR COUNTIES IS THAT YOU

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:08.462
PROVIDE THIS SERVICE.

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:11.064
YOU PAY THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:13.634
PROVIDED THE SERVICE THAT IS AS

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:17.404
AS A CLINICIAN OR A THE AGENCY

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:19.306
THAT THEY WORK FOR WHETHER IT'S

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:22.976
THE COUNTY OR THE PRIVATE AGENCY --

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:25.145
GETS PAID THE PRIVATE AGENCY IS

01:41:25.212 --> 01:41:27.748
PAID AND THEY SUBMIT A CLAIM THE

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:29.316
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:30.451
SUBMITS A CLAIM.

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:34.254
AND AND THEN WE'RE PAID IT'S

01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:36.223
ALWAYS REIMBURSEMENT.

01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:38.926
THERE'S A PACE THERE'S TIME LAG.

01:41:38.992 --> 01:41:42.529
AND SO MOST COUNTY DEPARTMENTS --

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:44.531
THERE OPERATE THEIR SERVICES IN

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:47.100
ARREARS --

01:41:47.167 --> 01:41:48.635
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:50.370
COME AFTER THE FACT AND THAT'S

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:51.738
RUNS ABOUT A TWO YEAR.

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:53.407
AFTER THE FACT SO WHEN THE

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:55.108
RECESSION HIT BACK BEING A

01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:56.510
DIRECTOR IN YOLO COUNTY.

01:41:56.577 --> 01:41:58.245
YOU KNOW THINGS WERE LOOKING

01:41:58.312 --> 01:42:00.547
OKAY IN AT IN THE MOMENT WHEN

01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:01.615
THE RECESSION HIT BECAUSE WE

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:03.150
WERE STILL.

01:42:03.217 --> 01:42:05.018
UP YOU KNOW TWO YEARS BEHIND

01:42:05.085 --> 01:42:07.921
THAT BUT BOY WHEN THE UPSWING

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.556
CAME WE WERE IN THE PIT.

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:11.258
AND SO THAT'S REALLY TOUGH AND

01:42:11.325 --> 01:42:12.860
SO MOST OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:42:12.926 --> 01:42:15.429
SERVICES OPERATE IN ARREARS.

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:18.866
BUT NEW IDEAS COME FORWARD AND

01:42:18.932 --> 01:42:20.300
NEW IMPLEMENTATION SEIZE HERE IS

01:42:20.367 --> 01:42:22.669
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A OF A GOOD

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:23.604
IDEA.

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:26.206
AND REALLY BUILT ON THE

01:42:26.273 --> 01:42:29.776
INTENTION AND PLANNED GOAL OF

01:42:29.843 --> 01:42:31.178
MEDI CAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:33.280
SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO OUR

01:42:33.347 --> 01:42:34.414
FOSTER YOUTH.

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:36.149
THAT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SHOULD

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:38.118
INCREASE THE SERVICES WHICH WILL

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:39.820
OCCUR AND YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR

01:42:39.887 --> 01:42:41.822
STAFF FIRST AND YOU HAVE TO PAY

01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:43.423
YOUR CONTRACTOR PROVIDERS FIRST

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.559
AND THEN YOU CAN SUBMIT CLAIMS

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:47.127
TO BE READ AND BURST.

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:50.797
SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE JUST AN

01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:52.733
OVERALL GENERAL AND THAT'S THE

01:42:52.799 --> 01:42:54.301
THERE WERE A BUT THE FUNDING IS

01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:55.435
STILL LAGGING THE SPENDING AT

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:55.969
THE LAGGED AND IT'S NOT

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:57.170
NECESSARILY BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:42:57.237 --> 01:42:57.371
TIME.

01:42:57.437 --> 01:42:59.072
I MEAN THERE'S A TIME LAG BY

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:00.941
DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM.

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.109
NOT NECESSARILY THERE SOMETIMES

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:03.877
TIME LIKES WITH DH CS BUT MORE

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:06.179
THAN THAT IT'S A SYSTEM DESIGNED

01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:07.681
BY TWO YEARS.

01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:09.483
WELL TWO YEARS IS THE MHSAA TIME

01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:10.984
LAG PLAN AND THAT'S BECAUSE

01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:13.620
PEOPLE FILE TAXES AFTER THE

01:43:13.687 --> 01:43:14.388
YEARS OVER.

01:43:14.454 --> 01:43:15.789
AND THEN AFTER THE YEARS OVER

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:19.393
PEOPLE DO FILE GET EXTENSIONS.

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:20.193
AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:24.064
THERE'S A TIME LAG THE AND WE'RE

01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:24.865
NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE WE'VE

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:26.667
DONE THIS ONE BY IT WE HAD A

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:28.402
VERY --

01:43:28.468 --> 01:43:30.103
COLORFUL MEETING.

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:31.705
ABOUT PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING

01:43:31.772 --> 01:43:32.906
AND I BELIEVE ALL YOU ALL WERE

01:43:32.973 --> 01:43:35.976
IN IN THAT MEETING AND SOUL.

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:37.844
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:40.080
DO IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THERE IS

01:43:40.147 --> 01:43:42.182
BACK MONEY LAYING AROUND THAT

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:44.117
HASN'T BEEN REVERTED BACK TO

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:45.018
WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO SO.

01:43:45.085 --> 01:43:47.054
WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS?

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.488
THERE IS MONEY THERE YEAH WHAT

01:43:48.555 --> 01:43:49.923
CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:51.491
MONEY GETS.

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:52.426
TO THE PROVIDER RIGHT MEDIA

01:43:52.492 --> 01:43:54.294
RIGHT AND SO I WOULD NEED TO GO

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:57.297
BACK TO THE ASSOCIATION BECAUSE

01:43:57.364 --> 01:44:00.267
MY FORMAL ASSIGNMENT IS NOT THE

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:00.934
FISCAL PIECE.

01:44:01.001 --> 01:44:03.036
AT SO WELL I KNOW MUCH OF IT I

01:44:03.103 --> 01:44:04.838
DON'T WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:05.639
OUR FISCAL.

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:07.374
FOLKS -- BUT

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:09.710
WE CAN OUT WITH ABSOLUTELY LIKE

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:10.677
TO HAVE A MEETING TO DISCUSS

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:12.446
THAT BECAUSE THERE IS AN ISSUE

01:44:12.512 --> 01:44:13.647
WITH TIME LAG.

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:17.184
AND THEN THE OTHER COMPONENT IS

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.986
I'M NOT SURE THAT THE DESIGN C.

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.621
C. R. WAS DESIGNED TO BE COST

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:22.856
NEUTRAL BUT IT'S AN INCREASE IN

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:23.490
SERVICES.

01:44:23.557 --> 01:44:25.292
AND SO THERE'S SOME ISSUES OF

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:27.127
PROP THIRTY PARTICULARLY WITH

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:28.595
CANS AND SOME OF THE OTHER

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:29.930
SERVICES THAT.

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:31.198
WE WILL BE REIMBURSED BUT

01:44:31.264 --> 01:44:33.033
THERE'S FORMULAS THEIR SET UP

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.034

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:36.470
YEAR YOU KNOW BEFORE HAND AND

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.971
NOW WE'RE IN IT.

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:39.673
AND SO IT'S OF THOSE KINDS OF

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.675
THINGS SO WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:44.277

01:44:44.344 --> 01:44:47.180

DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE TWO

01:44:58.592 --> 01:44:59.292
DEPARTMENTS.

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:01.228
AND IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THE

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:02.763
MEETINGS THAT WE WERE AND THAT

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:03.730
WAS THE MAJOR PART OF MY

01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:06.099
FRUSTRATION BECAUSE EVEN HAVING

RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

01:45:10.737 --> 01:45:12.239
AND SO --

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:13.573
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:16.376

01:45:46.573 --> 01:45:47.674
UNREALISTIC IT'S STILL

01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:48.775

HAVING ONE SYSTEM BUILDER IN MY

01:46:00.454 --> 01:46:02.155
OPINION PRETTY EASY FIX SAYS.

01:46:02.222 --> 01:46:03.190
BEING THAT --

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:06.426
IF THE WILL IS THERE THINGS THAT

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:08.929
YOU SEE ARE NOT AS EASY THAT IS

01:46:08.995 --> 01:46:11.031
GOING TO TAKE US THAT ARE GOING

01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:12.199
TO TAKE US A COUPLE YEARS.

01:46:12.265 --> 01:46:13.433
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I'M

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.602
INTERESTED IN BECAUSE WE CAN GET

01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:16.203
GRABBED THE ADMINISTRATION THE

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.571
BEGINNING.

01:46:17.637 --> 01:46:20.674
AT ME MAYBE I'M IN FANTASY TO OF

01:46:20.741 --> 01:46:21.608
WORLD BY TO GRAB THEM IN THE

01:46:21.675 --> 01:46:23.343
BEGINNING AND AT LEAST TELL THEM

01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:24.745
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:25.979
WHETHER IT BE THE FOLLOWING YEAR

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.547
OR TWO YEARS OR I MEAN.

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:28.815
LET AT SOME POINT THIS IS WHAT

01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:31.184
WE NEED AND SO WE CAN START

01:46:31.251 --> 01:46:31.585
TALKING TO THE NEW

01:46:31.651 --> 01:46:32.753
ADMINISTRATION.

01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:34.488
I ABOUT THE SUGGESTION SO MORE

01:46:34.554 --> 01:46:37.324
HOMEWORK IF YOU CAN MEET WITH US.

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:38.325
NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER TWO IF YOU

01:46:38.391 --> 01:46:39.092
CAN.

01:46:39.159 --> 01:46:40.594
PUT DOWN ON PAPER WHAT ARE THE

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:42.629
THINGS THAT YOU SEE THAT CAN BE

01:46:42.696 --> 01:46:44.197
FIXED THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:46.032
REQUIRE MONEY THE COMMUNICATION

01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:48.068
BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS COSTS

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:49.302
NOTHING.

01:46:49.369 --> 01:46:50.604
SO THAT MONEY IS NOT AN EXCUSE

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.005
SO THOSE THINGS THAT.

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:54.407
DO NOT COST ANYTHING THAT ARE.

01:46:54.474 --> 01:46:55.776
PRETTY SIMPLE LIKE THE FORMS FOR

01:46:55.842 --> 01:46:57.177
EXAMPLE THE FORMULAS YOU SAID

01:46:57.244 --> 01:46:58.145
SOMETHING ABOUT THE FORMS IN THE

01:46:58.211 --> 01:46:59.746
FORMULAS IF WE CAN FIX THOSE

01:46:59.813 --> 01:47:00.947
FORMS THAT BECAUSE CUT DOESN'T

01:47:01.014 --> 01:47:02.349
COST ANY MONEY.

01:47:02.415 --> 01:47:03.817
IT'S ABOUT STREAMLINING AND

01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:04.918
MAKING SURE THAT THOSE

01:47:04.985 --> 01:47:05.852
DEPARTMENTS COMMUNICATE WITH

01:47:05.919 --> 01:47:07.087
THEMSELVES SO.

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:08.789
THAT'S THE HOMEWORK --

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:10.023
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT THE TIME

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:12.125
FOR IT BUT THAT'S MY ASK OF YOU

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:14.394
AND I AM AVAILABLE --

01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:15.695

TO YOU AS WELL.

01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:25.972

COMMENTS OR FOLLOW UP

01:47:28.608 --> 01:47:28.842
[inaudible]

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:31.077
YEAH [inaudible]

01:47:31.144 --> 01:47:32.946
SO.

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:33.914
MY ONLY EXPERIENCE IS IT WITHIN

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:35.882
SHASTA COUNTY AND SO WALL I HAVE

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:36.817
A HAVE A GREAT --

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:37.417
CHAU -- AT

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:38.819
THE COUNTY LEVEL WHO'S VERY

01:47:38.885 --> 01:47:40.153
SUPPORTIVE OF FOSTER YOUTH IN

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:41.421
THE WORK THAT WE DO WITHIN OUR

01:47:41.488 --> 01:47:42.923
DEPARTMENT --

01:47:42.989 --> 01:47:44.357
IN THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BOARD

01:47:44.424 --> 01:47:46.293
OF SUPERVISORS AND THAT ARE VERY

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:47.594
INVESTED IN MENTAL HEALTH

01:47:47.661 --> 01:47:49.095
SERVICES --

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:51.064
TO CHILDREN --

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:53.800
AND SPECIFICALLY.

01:47:53.867 --> 01:47:55.936
SO I I FEEL SUPPORTED THEIR WHAT

01:47:56.002 --> 01:47:57.971
HAPPENS THOUGH IS THAT IF WE ARE

01:47:58.038 --> 01:48:00.040
NOT GIVEN SPECIFIC MONEY FOR THE

01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:01.875
INITIATIVES THAT COME DOWN OR

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:03.276
THE EXPECTATION THE WORK THAT'S

01:48:03.343 --> 01:48:04.811
DONE -- ALL

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:06.580
OUR GENERAL FRIENDS REALLY GOES

01:48:06.646 --> 01:48:07.914
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:48:07.981 --> 01:48:10.050
OF AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY

01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:11.785
WHAT WE RUN INTO AND SO WE OFTEN

01:48:11.852 --> 01:48:13.820
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ARE WE

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:16.823
GOING TO AB IT'S IT'S HONESTLY

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.391
MY CEOS --

01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:19.960
LITTLE METAPHORS THAT HE GIVES

01:48:20.026 --> 01:48:21.728
ABOUT PREVENTION YOU KNOW WE

01:48:21.795 --> 01:48:24.097
COULD EITHER STANDARD A CLIFF

01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:26.266
AND LOOK AT THE CAR THAT JUST

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.034
WENT OVER THE EDGE AND CRASH AND

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:28.735
HAVE TO GO DOWN WITH THE

01:48:28.802 --> 01:48:29.402
AMBULANCE.

01:48:29.469 --> 01:48:31.805
OR WE CAN BEGIN TO PUT UP A

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:33.039
FENCE THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THAT

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:35.175
CAR FROM GOING OVER AND SO IF WE

01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:37.177
DON'T START DOING SOMETHING TO

01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:39.012
ADDRESS THE ISSUES AT THE

01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:40.847
CHILDREN'S LEVEL --

01:48:40.914 --> 01:48:42.382
THEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:44.184
ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE WORK THAT

01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:45.752
WE'RE DOING AND SO I DO FEEL

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:47.821
SUPPORTED BUT AGAIN FUNDING HAS

01:48:47.888 --> 01:48:49.289
TO COME SPECIFICALLY TO OUR

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:50.123
PROGRAMS.

01:48:50.190 --> 01:48:51.491
IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:48:51.558 --> 01:48:52.959
USE IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE CHEN

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:54.227
OFFENSE REALLY DOES GO TO LAW

01:48:54.294 --> 01:48:57.230
ENFORCEMENT RIGHT AND ALSO JUST --

01:48:57.297 --> 01:48:58.298
WE TALKED ABOUT PROP SIXTY THREE

01:48:58.365 --> 01:49:00.967
MONEY I AND AND I KNOW THAT THAT

01:49:01.034 --> 01:49:02.469
YOU GAVE US THE INFORMATION BUT

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:04.571
THERE WAS NO SPECIFICS AS TO WHY

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:05.272
WHAT.

01:49:05.338 --> 01:49:06.606
PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY SHOULD BE

01:49:06.673 --> 01:49:09.075
USED FOR AND IF WE DON'T GIVE UP

01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:12.746
THE COUNTIES SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:13.480
ARE GOING TO USE THAT.

01:49:13.546 --> 01:49:15.982
FOR WHATEVER IT IS THAT.

01:49:16.049 --> 01:49:16.583
CAN I MAKE THIS THING AT THE

01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:18.051
TIME CAN I JUST ADD JUST HAVING

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:19.786
BEEN AT THE COUNTY FOR SO MANY

01:49:19.853 --> 01:49:21.321
YEARS.

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:23.290
THE OTHER PIECE THAT HAPPENS IS

01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:25.091
WHEN SERVICES ARE SUCCESSFULLY

01:49:25.158 --> 01:49:26.226
PROVIDED.

01:49:26.293 --> 01:49:28.028
AND CHILDREN IN YOU ADULTS AS

01:49:28.094 --> 01:49:28.895
WELL.

01:49:28.962 --> 01:49:31.898
ARE SERVED AND THERE'S A CHANGE.

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:34.567
THE COST AVOIDANCE AND COST

01:49:34.634 --> 01:49:38.038
SAVINGS RARELY IF AT ALL GET

01:49:38.104 --> 01:49:39.606
FILTERED BACK TO THE PROGRAM

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:41.308
THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING

01:49:41.374 --> 01:49:42.642
THAT CHANGE.

01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:45.178
AND SO THEN IT'S BECAUSE IF WE

01:49:45.245 --> 01:49:46.613
DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.948
IN JUVENILE HALL.

01:49:48.014 --> 01:49:50.750
IF WE DECREASE HOSPITAL BED DAYS

01:49:50.817 --> 01:49:52.752
IF WE'D DECREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:55.188
CALLS TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:57.724
BECAUSE THERE'S LESS BREAK INS.

01:49:57.791 --> 01:50:01.328
THOSE DOLLARS DON'T TURN AROUND

01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:03.363
TO THE PROGRAM THAT SUCCESSFULLY

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.165
PROVIDED THOSE SERVICES PROVIDED

01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:07.267
TBS BY A COMMUNITY BASED

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:09.302
PROVIDER WHO THE CHILD NO LONGER

01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:11.004
BREAKS INTO A STORE ANYMORE.

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:14.107
THOSE DON'T COME BACK AND SO.

01:50:14.174 --> 01:50:15.442
IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:17.210
ADDRESS THAT AND KEEP THAT GOING

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.812
BACK INTO THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD

01:50:18.878 --> 01:50:19.879
BE AMAZING.

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:21.314
LIKE IT'S HAPPENING TO US TWO OF

01:50:21.381 --> 01:50:22.916
MY MY BY IT BUDGET YEAR IS

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:24.384
ENDING AND I DIDN'T USE ALL OF

01:50:24.451 --> 01:50:25.652
MY FUNDS AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENS

01:50:25.719 --> 01:50:27.120
I GET TO LOSE THEM.

01:50:27.187 --> 01:50:29.089
AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:30.690
KNOW I WAS A TEACHER AS WELL AND

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:32.325
WHEN WHEN WE DON'T USE THEM IT

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:33.026
WAS A USING MY NEWSHAM.

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:34.127
WE'RE ALL BUSY TRYING TO FIGURE

01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:34.894
OUT HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY

01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:36.629
INSTEAD OF SAVING IT FOR A RAINY

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:38.932
DAY AND AND KEEPING IT FOR FOR

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:39.733
OTHER SERVICES THAT CAN BE

01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:40.767
PROVIDED SO.

01:50:40.834 --> 01:50:41.801
I THINK WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME

01:50:41.868 --> 01:50:43.103
SITUATION AND I THINK THAT'S

01:50:43.169 --> 01:50:45.705
KIND OF A GOVERNMENTAL MENTALITY

01:50:45.772 --> 01:50:46.473
THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN BREAK

01:50:46.539 --> 01:50:50.076
THERE AND AND TRY.

WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:56.910
THE FRONT END IN TAKEN LINKAGE

STAFF TO COORDINATE AND SUPPORT

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:05.051
THE PROCESS.

01:52:05.118 --> 01:52:07.587
THAT SO THE WAY IT WORKS IS --

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:09.589
IN OUR SYSTEM THAT --

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:11.024

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:19.933
MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING TOOL IS --

01:52:19.999 --> 01:52:21.968

SO IT MOST MENTAL HEALTH

01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:43.089
SCREENINGS ARE POSITIVE.

01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:44.057

USEFUL AND RELEVANT CASE PLANS.

01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:41.034
SO WE'VE COMPLETED MORE THAN

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:41.901
THREE HUNDRED MATT ASSESSMENTS

01:55:41.968 --> 01:55:44.070

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.182
OFFICES.

01:55:56.249 --> 01:55:57.250
THE KIND OF ON A GRANULAR LEVEL

01:55:57.317 --> 01:56:01.821
OR DOING LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:02.588
THE CHALLENGES --

01:56:02.655 --> 01:56:04.390
THAT WE HAVE IN LA --

01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:07.026
IT IS THE SIZE JUST THE SHEER

01:56:07.093 --> 01:56:08.328
SIZE OF THE OPERATION.

01:56:08.394 --> 01:56:09.962
ARM RIGHT NOW --

01:56:10.029 --> 01:56:10.496
WE HAVE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND

01:56:10.563 --> 01:56:13.499
CHILDREN IN CARE --

01:56:13.566 --> 01:56:16.035
OVERSEEN BY FORTY TWO HUNDRED

01:56:16.102 --> 01:56:18.338
SOCIAL WORKERS ACROSS TWENTY

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:19.939
TWENTY ONE REGIONAL OFFICES.

01:56:20.006 --> 01:56:21.908
IS AN ENORMOUS OPERATION IT'S

01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:24.043
IT'S NOT EASY TO GET EVERYONE

01:56:24.110 --> 01:56:25.178
ALIGNED IN THE SAME DIRECTION

01:56:25.244 --> 01:56:27.246
ALL THE TIME THAT'S ONE OF OUR

01:56:27.313 --> 01:56:28.548
CHALLENGES.

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:29.415
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT THANK

01:56:29.482 --> 01:56:31.217
YOU -- AND

01:56:31.284 --> 01:56:33.052
SO I THINK.

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:34.821
A BIGGER CHALLENGE --

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:36.489
AT RELATED TO IT CAT TO RENO WAS

01:56:36.556 --> 01:56:38.858
SAYING TO IS ALTHOUGH THE FRONT

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:40.793
END WORKS EFFICIENTLY IN THE WAY

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.662
THAT I'VE DESCRIBED --

01:56:42.729 --> 01:56:44.564
I DO THINK WE EXPERIENCE GAPS

01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:46.532
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT INITIAL

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:50.370
SCREENING ASSESSMENT AND LINKAGE --

01:56:50.436 --> 01:56:52.038
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I WE

01:56:52.105 --> 01:56:53.606
FIND IS THAT THERE'S REALLY NO

01:56:53.673 --> 01:56:56.442
CENTRAL DE MH DATA SYSTEM.

01:56:56.509 --> 01:56:58.611
THAT LONGITUDINALLY TRACKS

01:56:58.678 --> 01:57:01.481
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE LINKAGE --

01:57:01.547 --> 01:57:02.248
SO WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:05.051
UNDERSTANDING OF ANY INDIVIDUAL

01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:07.887
CHILD'S TRAJECTORY IN THE MENTAL

01:57:07.954 --> 01:57:08.755
HEALTH SYSTEM.

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:10.289
AND BECAUSE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:57:10.356 --> 01:57:12.291
THAT TRAJECTORY WE REALLY

01:57:12.358 --> 01:57:13.626
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:15.695
GOOD STRATEGIES. TO ENSURE

01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:17.497
CONTINUITY OF TREATMENT WHEN A

01:57:17.563 --> 01:57:20.500
CHILD IS REPLACED OR TO EVEN PRO

01:57:20.566 --> 01:57:22.368
ACTIVELY RESPOND --

01:57:22.435 --> 01:57:23.970
TO ANY ESCALATED MENTAL HEALTH

01:57:24.036 --> 01:57:25.405
NEEDS IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID

01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:28.975
REPLACEMENT THAT'S OUR GOAL --

01:57:29.041 --> 01:57:29.876
SO.

01:57:29.942 --> 01:57:31.344
IN CONCLUSION I WOULD LIKE TO

01:57:31.411 --> 01:57:32.712
SAY THAT WE CARE ABOUT THESE

01:57:32.779 --> 01:57:34.080
CHILDREN VERY MUCH.

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:36.149
AND ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:37.583
PARTNERS AND COLLEAGUES IN THE

01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:39.419
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH TO

01:57:39.485 --> 01:57:39.986
MAKE SURE THEY GET WHAT THEY

01:57:40.052 --> 01:57:43.856
NEED.

01:57:49.362 --> 01:57:50.663
LITIGATION.

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:52.932
IT IS THAT'S FAR OF A IMPETUS TO

01:57:52.999 --> 01:57:54.100
THAT'S FOR A LONGITUDINAL

01:57:54.167 --> 01:57:56.803
TRACKING SYSTEM.

01:57:56.869 --> 01:57:59.338

01:58:01.274 --> 01:58:03.376
SERVICES FOR THESE CHILDREN AND

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:05.077

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:06.813
A LOT ON SOME TECHNICAL ASPECTS

01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:08.881
OF IT AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTATION

01:58:08.948 --> 01:58:10.750
OF THE CORE PRACTICE MODEL BUT

01:58:10.817 --> 01:58:12.118
NO THE LONGITUDINAL TRACKING.

01:58:12.185 --> 01:58:13.352

GET EVERYONE A LINE.

01:58:21.227 --> 01:58:22.728

IT IT COULD BE IN A GROUP HOME

02:02:48.661 --> 02:02:50.129

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:55.868
PLACEMENT.

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:57.503
THAT IS ALSO VERY SHORT TERM

02:02:57.570 --> 02:02:59.972
ABOUT THREE MONTHS --

JUSTICE POPULATION OR PROBATION

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:20.059
YOUTH AND WHAT THAT REQUIRES

02:03:20.126 --> 02:03:21.527
WORK WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY

02:03:21.594 --> 02:03:22.394

APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN WEEKS AND

02:03:40.579 --> 02:03:41.781

WE ACTUALLY HAVE A DEPARTMENT

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:03.102
FOCUSED ON NOT --

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:05.471
BECAUSE WE KNOW --

02:04:05.538 --> 02:04:07.306
THE FAMILY AND YOUTH VOICE IS

02:04:07.373 --> 02:04:09.175
CRITICAL TO THE WORK WE DO.

02:04:09.241 --> 02:04:11.243

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:26.192
WORK AFTER US AND THEY ALSO

02:04:26.258 --> 02:04:28.160
ADVOCATE SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE

02:04:28.227 --> 02:04:30.629
HAVE IS AN EMPOWERMENT TRAIN

02:04:30.696 --> 02:04:31.230
CENTER.

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:32.097
IT'S ACTUALLY FUNDED THROUGH US

02:04:32.164 --> 02:04:33.833

JUST IN OUR PROGRAMS BUT ACROSS

02:04:44.376 --> 02:04:45.811
THE REGION.

02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:47.112
I THE OTHER THING WE HAVE

02:04:47.179 --> 02:04:48.414
IDENTIFIED BECAUSE STAFF

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.782
RETENTION HAS BEEN A REAL

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:51.584
CHALLENGE FOR US --

02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:53.752
CgA QUALIFIED STAFF AND STAFF

02:04:53.819 --> 02:04:55.254

02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:57.890
WORK OF GOING INTO FAMILIES

02:04:57.957 --> 02:04:58.457
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN <u>NG CALL</u>

02:04:58.524 --> 02:05:01.026
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AN ON CALL

02:05:01.093 --> 02:05:02.428
COMPONENT TO THE WORK WE DO.

02:05:02.494 --> 02:05:07.766
ON THOSE FOR PATHWAYS ON AND

02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:08.734
THAT'S ALSO FUNDED THROUGH OFSHE

02:05:08.801 --> 02:05:11.203
HAD WERE WERE IDENTIFYING --

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:13.405
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND

02:05:13.472 --> 02:05:15.074
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WHO ARE

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.776
INTERESTED IN THE WORK AND WE

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:19.078
TRAIN THEM AND THEY GET THEIR

02:05:19.144 --> 02:05:22.181
INTERNSHIP HOURS AND EXPERIENCE --

02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:24.483
AT OUR PROGRAM AND HOPEFULLY

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:26.986
THEY STAY WITH US HUH OR OR

02:05:27.052 --> 02:05:28.821
THERE IS SOME STAY WITH US AND

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:30.789
SOME DECIDE YOU KNOW BUT MAYBE

02:05:30.856 --> 02:05:32.892
IT ISN'T THE RIGHT FIT FOR THEM.

02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:35.494
BUT ULTIMATELY THEY WILL HAVE

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:36.962
GROWN THROUGH THE PROCESS AND

02:05:37.029 --> 02:05:39.164
MOST HAVE ACTUALLY WANTED TO

02:05:39.231 --> 02:05:40.766
STAY IN THE FIELD SO THAT'S

02:05:40.833 --> 02:05:42.868
REALLY POSITIVE --

02:05:42.935 --> 02:05:44.270
BUT THAT'S VERY NEW THAT'S OUR

02:05:44.336 --> 02:05:46.005
SECOND YEAR OF DOING THE CAREER

02:05:46.071 --> 02:05:47.473
PATHWAYS --

02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:50.743
WE ALSO DO SOMETHING CALLED --

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:52.077
I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT

02:05:52.144 --> 02:05:53.445
BECAUSE OF CCAR --

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:57.416
I SSE INTENSIVE SERVICES --

02:05:57.483 --> 02:05:59.151
IF IT WAS AYE TSC SO IT'S REALLY

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:01.186
HARD FOR ME TO CHANGE MY

02:06:01.253 --> 02:06:03.155
LANGUAGE WE DID IT OF SEE FOR

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:04.290
MANY YEARS --

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:09.895
SO IT'S INTENSIVE SERVICES

02:06:09.962 --> 02:06:10.229
FOSTER CARE --

02:06:10.296 --> 02:06:10.796
AND WE ALSO DO STANDARD

02:06:10.863 --> 02:06:12.264
TREATMENT FOSTER CARE AND THOSE

02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:13.899
INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER YOUTH

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:15.134
ARE TYPICALLY THOSE THAT

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.535
OTHERWISE WOULD BE AND

02:06:16.602 --> 02:06:17.970
CONGREGATE CARE THEY HAVE HAD

02:06:18.037 --> 02:06:19.972
MULTIPLE PLACEMENTS --

02:06:20.039 --> 02:06:22.775
REALLY STRUGGLED ON IN IN ANY

02:06:22.841 --> 02:06:24.310
PLACE THAT THEY'VE BEEN EN AND

02:06:24.376 --> 02:06:26.445
WE IDENTIFY --

02:06:26.512 --> 02:06:29.882
PARENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE --

02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:32.451
SO IT'S IT'S OFTEN SAID SPECIAL

02:06:32.518 --> 02:06:35.621
ED TEACHER OR A ON SOMEBODY

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:37.656
THAT'S BEEN IN THE FIELD --

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:39.658
A LOT OF DIFFERENT FOLKS THAT --

02:06:39.725 --> 02:06:43.529
NURSES ACTUALLY MAKE GREAT --

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:46.298
ANY MEDICAL PROVIDER OF A ON

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:48.033
TEACHERS MAKE GREAT AT AYE SFC

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:49.134
PARENTS --

02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:51.070
WE ARE STRUGGLING OUR BIGGEST

02:06:51.136 --> 02:06:53.839
CHALLENGES RECRUITING THIS THIS

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:55.507
ON POPULATION.

02:06:55.574 --> 02:06:58.310
A LOT OF IT IS VERY HARD ON THE

02:06:58.377 --> 02:07:00.646
BEST WAY TO RECRUIT IS WORD OF

02:07:00.713 --> 02:07:02.982
MOUTH FROM OTHER FAMILIES --

02:07:03.048 --> 02:07:05.417
AND WITH SOME OF THE CHANGES

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:07.019
WITH C. C. R. WE'VE ACTUALLY

02:07:07.086 --> 02:07:09.588
SEEN A REDUCTION OF PEOPLE EAGER

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:11.757
TO JUMP ON BOARD SO THAT HAS

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:14.026
BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR US --

02:07:14.093 --> 02:07:15.728
THERE ARE ALSO --

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:17.363
ONE OF OUR AREAS OF IDENTIFYING

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:19.031
CAN AND SUPPORTING CAN IT'S A

02:07:19.098 --> 02:07:21.266
GREAT OPPORTUNITY WITH C. C. R.

02:07:21.333 --> 02:07:22.835
BUT WE ARE JUST AT THE BABY

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:24.970
STAGES OF REALLY PROVIDING THE

02:07:25.037 --> 02:07:26.538
SAME LEVEL I'M TALKING ABOUT THE

02:07:26.605 --> 02:07:27.906
SYSTEM.

02:07:27.973 --> 02:07:29.641
SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO THE CAN

02:07:29.708 --> 02:07:31.076
FAMILIES IDENTIFYING THEM

02:07:31.143 --> 02:07:33.379
ENSURING THAT THEY ARE TREATED

02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:35.881
ON WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY

02:07:35.948 --> 02:07:38.484
NEED TO SUPPORT.

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:39.852
THOSE PHOSTRIA IF.

02:07:39.918 --> 02:07:40.953
I'M I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:42.254
ABOUT THE CHILD FAMILY TEAMING

02:07:42.321 --> 02:07:44.690
JUST BRIEFLY IT IS IN ALL OF OUR

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:46.592
DECISION MAKING PROCESS IT'S

02:07:46.658 --> 02:07:48.160
BEEN EMBEDDED IN OUR PROGRAMS.

02:07:48.227 --> 02:07:50.029
SINCE WE STARTED WRAPAROUND MANY

02:07:50.095 --> 02:07:51.463
YEARS AGO --

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:53.132
WITH IT REQUIRES PROPER

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:55.167
FACILITATION AND THE ASSURANCE

02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:57.169
THAT THAT YOUTH VOICE AND THE

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:59.204
PARENT VOICE ARE AT THE TABLE.

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:02.307
WE ACTUALLY REQUIRE THAT THERE'S

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:06.045
A YOU HAD THE PRESIDENT

02:08:06.111 --> 02:08:07.780
PROFESSIONALS CAN INTIMIDATE

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:09.615
BOTH THE THE PICK THE PARENT AND

02:08:09.681 --> 02:08:11.083
THE YOUNG PERSON.

02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:12.518
AND WE WANT SOMEONE THAT'S

02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:14.219
BASICALLY SUPPORTING THEM IN

02:08:14.286 --> 02:08:16.588
THEIR VOICE IN THE WORK WHAT

02:08:16.655 --> 02:08:18.190
DECISIONS ARE MADE IN THE C. F.

02:08:18.257 --> 02:08:19.525
T. ARE TO BE HONORED AND THAT'S

02:08:19.591 --> 02:08:21.760
AN EXPECTATION THE FEAR IS.

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:23.796
THAT THOSE DECISIONS ARE AND

02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:26.465
DONE AFTER OUTSIDE OF THE C. F.

02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:27.566
T..

02:08:27.633 --> 02:08:28.967
WE ALSO --

02:08:29.034 --> 02:08:30.669
HAD A UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:32.571
LEVEL OF CARE COULD BE ON

02:08:32.638 --> 02:08:34.740
BASICALLY REVIEWED LEVEL OF CARE

02:08:34.807 --> 02:08:36.275
PLACEMENT FOR A FOSTER YOUTH.

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:38.710
IN THE C. F. T. AND NOT IS A

02:08:38.777 --> 02:08:39.945
CONCERN THAT THAT'S NOT

02:08:40.012 --> 02:08:42.948
NECESSARILY HAPPENING THAT WAY

02:08:43.015 --> 02:08:44.650
AND PARENTS AND ESPECIALLY THE

02:08:44.716 --> 02:08:46.685
PARENTS ARE LEFT OUT OF THAT

02:08:46.752 --> 02:08:48.120
DISCUSSION --

02:08:48.187 --> 02:08:49.688
SO WE ARE IN THE BABY STEPS OF

02:08:49.755 --> 02:08:51.690
THAT BUT THAT'S ALSO A CONCERN

02:08:51.757 --> 02:08:52.991
AND THEN --

02:08:53.058 --> 02:08:54.560
AYE ALREADY TOUCHED ON ON THE

02:08:54.626 --> 02:08:55.727
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF

02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:57.896
FOSTER PARENTS ONE THING THAT WE

02:08:57.963 --> 02:08:59.131
ARE DOING --

02:08:59.198 --> 02:09:01.633
IS IDENTIFYING MENTOR PARENTS.

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:03.769
THAT SUPPORT OTHER --

02:09:03.836 --> 02:09:05.804
FOSTER PARENTS IN THE WORK WE DO

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:08.240
OBVIOUSLY WE TRAIN AMEND TRAUMA

02:09:08.307 --> 02:09:10.275
INFORMED WORK AND PRESENTING

02:09:10.342 --> 02:09:11.944
PROBLEMS THAT THE YOUTH HAVE AND

02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:12.945
THAT THAT BEHAVIORS ARE NOT

02:09:13.011 --> 02:09:14.413
NECESSARILY.

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.849
BECAUSE OF THE ANYTHING PERSONAL

02:09:16.915 --> 02:09:18.283
BETWEEN THE FOSTER PARENT AND

02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:20.586
THE FOSTER YOUTH BUT BECAUSE OF

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:25.057
A REACTION --

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:26.325
TO ETCETERA --

02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:28.460
TRAINING PARENTS TO UNDERSTAND

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:29.027
THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE

02:09:29.094 --> 02:09:30.629
EMOTIONAL RESPONSE THAT OCCURS

02:09:30.696 --> 02:09:31.663
WHEN YOU'RE RAISING A CHILD

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:33.098
THAT'S SCREAMING AT YOU ARE

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:34.733
THROWING SOMETHING OUT YOU OR

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:35.400
DAMAGING.

02:09:35.467 --> 02:09:37.302
YOUR PRIZE VEHICLE OR SOMETHING

02:09:37.369 --> 02:09:39.605
YOU KNOW SO THAT IS AN ONGOING

02:09:39.671 --> 02:09:41.974
WORK AND THE MENTOR PARENTS HAVE

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:44.710
SERVED A REALLY REALLY KEY ROLE

02:09:44.776 --> 02:09:46.378
THAT SAY SOME OTHER.

02:09:46.445 --> 02:09:47.846
OF US YOU KNOW --

02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:49.214
HAVE A HARD TIME DOING BECAUSE

02:09:49.281 --> 02:09:50.516
WE CAN'T NECESSARILY SAY WELL MY

02:09:50.582 --> 02:09:53.252
KID DID THAT TOO EVEN IF WE DID

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:55.087
YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY DEAD BUT IT

02:09:55.154 --> 02:09:57.055
IS REALLY HELPFUL WHEN A FOSTER

02:09:57.122 --> 02:09:59.191
PARENT SAYS I'VE BEEN THERE.

02:09:59.258 --> 02:10:00.893
YEAH SO --

02:10:00.959 --> 02:10:02.194
ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HEARD WAS

02:10:02.261 --> 02:10:04.062
WE'VE HAD SOME.

02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:05.430
OF GROWTH.

02:10:05.497 --> 02:10:06.598
THERE'S BIRTH NUMBERS AND OUR

02:10:06.665 --> 02:10:08.167
MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS THOSE

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:10.035
AREN'T GETTING PASS IT DOWN TO

02:10:10.102 --> 02:10:12.037
THE DIRECT SERVICE AND I KNOW

02:10:12.104 --> 02:10:13.872
THAT THINGS COST MORE AND ALL

02:10:13.939 --> 02:10:15.274
LEVELS.

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:18.310
BUT ESSENTIALLY WHEN WE ON ARE

02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:20.412
ASKED TO DELIVER THE SAME AMOUNT

02:10:20.479 --> 02:10:22.414
OF SERVICES OVER AND YEARS AND

02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:25.217
YEARS THE COSTS GO UP IT BECOMES

02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:27.486
MORE DEMANDING FOR US TO DELIVER

02:10:27.553 --> 02:10:29.922
THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICES IN

02:10:29.988 --> 02:10:31.256
THE SAME QUALITY --

02:10:31.323 --> 02:10:32.958
AND SO THERE IS A CONCERN

02:10:33.025 --> 02:10:35.360
BECAUSE I I BELIEVE EVEN IN OUR

02:10:35.427 --> 02:10:37.496
ON OUR OUR COUNTY THE

02:10:37.563 --> 02:10:39.698
PENETRATION RATE THE AMOUNT OF

02:10:39.765 --> 02:10:40.532
CHILDREN.

02:10:40.599 --> 02:10:44.570
GETTING SERVICES AND RELATIONS

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:49.274
SO THAT SIGN THAT I DO HAVE --

02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:50.809
THAT I JUST WANT TO BRING UP

02:10:50.876 --> 02:10:53.178
WHEN I HEARD THAT GROWTH

02:10:53.245 --> 02:10:55.280
HEADACHE INCREASED.

02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:56.982
THANK YOU AND JUST A SIDE

02:10:57.049 --> 02:10:58.550
COMMENT I WAS A TEACHER AND AND

02:10:58.617 --> 02:11:00.219
YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:01.520
ALL THE MONEY THAT'S GOING BACK

02:11:01.587 --> 02:11:02.754
TO THE SCHOOLS GOING BACK TO THE

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:03.889
SCHOOLS AND IT REALLY IS NOT

02:11:03.956 --> 02:11:05.190
MAKING IT INTO THE CLASSROOM.

02:11:05.257 --> 02:11:06.858
AND SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

02:11:06.925 --> 02:11:09.027
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT IN ALL

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:11.096
OF OUR SALARIES GOING UP --

02:11:11.163 --> 02:11:13.098
IT'S GOING TO DEFINITELY IMPACT --

02:11:13.165 --> 02:11:14.233
THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE TRYING TO

02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:16.134
RECRUIT JUST BASIC FOLKS FOR

02:11:16.201 --> 02:11:17.736
BASIC SERVICES SO I APPRECIATE

02:11:17.803 --> 02:11:19.271
THE COMMENT DON'T BE AFRAID TO

02:11:19.338 --> 02:11:20.505
SAY TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS

02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:21.306
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:23.242
REASON THAT WE'RE HERE.

02:11:23.308 --> 02:11:23.842
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR

02:11:23.909 --> 02:11:25.644
THEM BECAUSE I THINK WHAT

02:11:25.711 --> 02:11:27.212
HAPPENED SOMETIMES FOLKS IN

02:11:27.279 --> 02:11:28.880
THESE TYPES OF HEARINGS AND IN

02:11:28.947 --> 02:11:30.182
THE SUB ONE HEARING THEY'RE FREE

02:11:30.249 --> 02:11:31.149
TO TELL US THE TRUTH AND THE

02:11:31.216 --> 02:11:33.485
REASON THAT WE'RE HERE IS. TO BE

02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:34.786
TOLD THE TRUTH BECAUSE IF WE

02:11:34.853 --> 02:11:35.988
LEAVE HERE THINKING THAT

02:11:36.054 --> 02:11:37.389
EVERYTHING'S FINE THEN WHY ARE

02:11:37.456 --> 02:11:38.357
WE HERE.

02:11:38.423 --> 02:11:41.393
AND SO SOUL IF YOU CAN IF YOU

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:42.728
CAN JUST BE REALLY STRAIGHT AND

02:11:42.794 --> 02:11:44.496
HONEST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE

02:11:44.563 --> 02:11:45.731
CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT ON

02:11:45.797 --> 02:11:47.065
THIS WE KNOW WE STILL MAY NOT BE

02:11:47.132 --> 02:11:48.533
ABLE TO DO MUCH ABOUT IT.

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:50.469
BUT AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THOSE

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:52.070
ARE THE ISSUES AND WE CAN AT

02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:53.338
LEAST WORK TOWARDS --

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:55.507
A RESOLUTION FOR THAT ANY

02:11:55.574 --> 02:11:56.975
QUESTIONS OR ANY.

02:11:57.042 --> 02:11:58.510
COME LARGEST MAKE A COUPLE OF

02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:01.813
OBSERVATIONS I THINK --

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:04.783
A LOT OF THESE TARGET AND

02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:06.385
SETTING QUESTIONS.

02:12:06.451 --> 02:12:07.986
IT BRINGS TO MIND JOHN KENNEDY

02:12:08.053 --> 02:12:09.254
WHO ONCE SAID THE GOVERNOR'S TO

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:10.889
CHOOSE.

02:12:10.956 --> 02:12:12.157
YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO

02:12:12.224 --> 02:12:13.558
IS ACTUALLY CHOOSE AMONG

02:12:13.625 --> 02:12:14.993
ALTERNATIVES [inaudible]

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:19.197
AND THINGS JUST SORT OF COME UP.

02:12:19.264 --> 02:12:21.266
AS I SIT HERE I ACTUALLY STARTED

02:12:21.333 --> 02:12:24.002
THE BUILDING THIS IS CRAZY MORE

02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:26.071
THAN FORTY ONE YEARS AGO.

02:12:26.138 --> 02:12:27.472
AND SINCE I'M A LAWYER I'VE DONE

02:12:27.539 --> 02:12:29.641
LOOK LET'S JUST A WAR CONTINUES

02:12:29.708 --> 02:12:31.243
IN VARIOUS SETTINGS ALL THAT.

02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:32.477
TIME.

02:12:32.544 --> 02:12:34.446
BUT MY FIRST BOSS SO THIS WOULD

02:12:34.513 --> 02:12:37.916
HAVE BEEN ABOUT.

02:12:37.983 --> 02:12:38.517
NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SEVENTY

02:12:38.583 --> 02:12:39.151
EIGHT WHICH IS A NOT WHAT THIS

02:12:39.217 --> 02:12:39.718
AREA.

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:40.952
BUT WAS SKILLED NURSING

02:12:41.019 --> 02:12:42.254
FACILITIES.

02:12:42.321 --> 02:12:43.755
AND THE CHALLENGE OF RETAINING

02:12:43.822 --> 02:12:44.856
PEOPLE.

02:12:44.923 --> 02:12:46.458
THAT YOU NEEDED TO PROVIDE A

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:49.194
SKILL LIBERAL LEVEL OF CARE.

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:51.229
A MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE THE

02:12:51.296 --> 02:12:51.797
ONE ACTUALLY DO THE BEST AND

02:12:51.863 --> 02:12:53.165
DELIVERING IT.

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:54.266
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE

02:12:54.333 --> 02:12:56.702
WORKED IN WAY BACK THEN WAS --

02:12:56.768 --> 02:12:58.370
FIND IN A WAY TO PROVIDE STATE

02:12:58.437 --> 02:13:00.205
DOLLARS TO BACK FILL IN SUPPORT

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:03.575
WHAT THEY WERE PAID. TO A VITAL

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:04.710
BETTER THAN INCOME ADVANTAGE.

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:08.180
I I'M JUST SAYING OKAY THAT'S

02:13:08.246 --> 02:13:09.715
THAT'S AN IDEA TO DEAL WITH

02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:11.316
RETENTION ISSUES AND HOW DO YOU

02:13:11.383 --> 02:13:12.818
KEEP QUALITY PEOPLE THERE SO

02:13:12.884 --> 02:13:14.786
MAYBE THAT'S IN SOME WAY SHAPE

02:13:14.853 --> 02:13:16.421
OR FORM AN IDEA.

02:13:16.488 --> 02:13:18.323
THINK ABOUT.

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:21.059
OF THE OTHER ISSUE NINETEEN

02:13:21.126 --> 02:13:22.361
EIGHTY TWO A. BE SEVENTEEN

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:24.229
THIRTY THREE WE SET.

02:13:24.296 --> 02:13:26.765
IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

02:13:26.832 --> 02:13:28.467
A BILL TO THE CURRENT GOVERNOR

02:13:28.533 --> 02:13:30.335
WAY BACK THEN.

02:13:30.402 --> 02:13:32.337
WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO SET ASIDE

02:13:32.404 --> 02:13:33.305
A MINIMUM OF FIFTY GRAND FOR

02:13:33.372 --> 02:13:34.005
EVERY.

02:13:34.072 --> 02:13:36.608
EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE. FOR

02:13:36.675 --> 02:13:38.243
CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION COURSE LA

02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:40.679
COUNTY GOT A BIG PILE OF MONEY.

02:13:40.746 --> 02:13:41.980
BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST

02:13:42.047 --> 02:13:44.549
SYSTEMATIC WAY TO TRY TO FIND AT

02:13:44.616 --> 02:13:46.051
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:13:46.118 --> 02:13:48.153
A MULTI DISCIPLINARY LOCAL

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:49.888
ENVISION APPROACHES FOR DEALING

02:13:49.955 --> 02:13:51.523
WITH CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND

02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:53.191
DEDICATED THE FUNDS AT THE LOCAL

02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:54.760
LEVEL SO THE LOCALS HAD.

02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:56.962
FUNDS TO WORK WITH.

02:13:57.028 --> 02:13:59.631
AND KERRY THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF

02:13:59.698 --> 02:14:00.232
PRIORITY SETTING FOR THE STATE

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:02.601
LEVEL. TO KIND OF SAY WELL WE

02:14:02.667 --> 02:14:04.269
CAN GO UNDER SHASTA COUNTY AND

02:14:04.336 --> 02:14:06.238
LET THEM FASHION A SHASTA COUNTY

02:14:06.304 --> 02:14:07.839
SOLUTION.

02:14:07.906 --> 02:14:09.241
BECAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED TO KIDS

02:14:09.307 --> 02:14:11.643
IN CHESTER COUNTY.

02:14:11.710 --> 02:14:13.345
WHO WHO HAVE ISSUES?

02:14:13.412 --> 02:14:13.945
HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES THE KIDS

02:14:14.012 --> 02:14:15.514
IN.

02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:17.382
ALAMEDA OR SAN RECESS COR LA OR

02:14:17.449 --> 02:14:18.917
SAN DIEGO.

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:21.853
AND SO AGAIN I DO THINK THIS

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:23.688
BRAINSTORMING.

02:14:23.755 --> 02:14:26.591
HOW DO WE TRANSLATE IDEALS AND

02:14:26.658 --> 02:14:28.126
POLICY IN AFFECTED PRIORITY

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:29.361
SETTING?

02:14:29.428 --> 02:14:31.396
THAT SUPPORT GOOD OUTCOMES IN

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:33.298
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:34.332
AND I'M MORE SURE THESE OLD

02:14:34.399 --> 02:14:36.134
STORIES BECAUSE IT IT DOES

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:37.602
RELATE TO WELL.

02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:39.738
WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD SOLUTION?

02:14:39.805 --> 02:14:41.673
AND THEN HOW DO WE GO ABOUT

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:43.909
TRYING TO MAKE THAT SALE.

02:14:43.975 --> 02:14:45.010
SO THAT WE CAN CHOOSE TO GO ON

02:14:45.076 --> 02:14:45.844
THAT WAY.

02:14:45.911 --> 02:14:47.112
AND OF COURSE SURE YOU HAVE THE

02:14:47.179 --> 02:14:48.613

AS WELL AS SOUTHERN --

02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:50.882
WHAT WE HEAR FROM COUNTY IS THAT

02:19:50.949 --> 02:19:52.717
IT THAT IT'S HARDER TO PLACE

02:19:52.784 --> 02:19:55.386

CHILDREN OF THAT AGE.

02:20:11.636 --> 02:20:13.605
WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THE PACKET

02:20:13.671 --> 02:20:15.039
REFERRALS THAT WE GET REALLY

02:20:15.106 --> 02:20:18.877
TEND TO FOCUS ON ON HOW?

02:20:18.943 --> 02:20:21.279
EXTREMELY HE ARE DAMAGED OTHER

02:20:21.346 --> 02:20:23.448
COMPLEX COMPLEX TRAUMA THAT THE

02:20:23.515 --> 02:20:24.816
KIDS HAVE EXPERIENCED HOW

02:20:24.883 --> 02:20:27.452
DIFFICULT THEIR BEHAVIORS ARE.

02:20:27.519 --> 02:20:29.254
THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN THOSE

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:30.755
PACKETS ABOUT --

02:20:30.822 --> 02:20:33.658
STRENGTHS ABOUT --

02:20:33.725 --> 02:20:35.226
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT THE THAT

WHAT IS REDEEMING.

02:20:40.064 --> 02:20:41.900
ABOUT THEM --

02:20:41.966 --> 02:20:43.902
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:20:43.968 --> 02:20:46.871
RELY ON IS PERSONAL INTERVIEWS

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:48.773
AMONG THOSE YOUTH ONCE WE SCREEN

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.608
PACKETS AND THINK WE CAN HELP

02:20:50.675 --> 02:20:53.978
OUR YOUTH WE WANT TO THEM IN

02:20:54.045 --> 02:20:54.546
PERSON.

02:20:54.612 --> 02:20:56.414
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE OFTEN

02:20:56.481 --> 02:20:58.716
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FAR AWAY.

02:20:58.783 --> 02:21:01.953
SO WE ASK COUNTIES TO DO SKYPE.

AND THEY DON'T WANT TO THEY THEY

02:21:03.421 --> 02:21:04.756
SAY THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY

02:21:04.823 --> 02:21:08.026
PROBABLY 95% OF COUNTY SAY THEY

02:21:08.092 --> 02:21:09.494
CAN'T DO IT WE SAY WELL WILL

02:21:09.561 --> 02:21:11.896

02:21:14.766 --> 02:21:14.999
[inaudible]

02:21:15.066 --> 02:21:17.035
AND TOM

02:21:17.101 --> 02:21:19.337
OF THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT OUR

02:21:19.404 --> 02:21:21.139
SKYPE IS HIPPA COMPLIANT --

02:21:21.206 --> 02:21:21.940

WE CAN DO IT AND IT'S AN

02:21:23.474 --> 02:21:24.809

OF BEGIN TO CONNECT WITH A YEAR

02:21:29.347 --> 02:21:30.949
WITH.

02:21:31.015 --> 02:21:32.917
OUT ONE THING I I I DIDN'T

MENTION ABOUT CASA PACIFICA.

02:21:36.154 --> 02:21:37.989
AND I THINK IS SOMEWHAT RELEVANT

02:21:38.056 --> 02:21:40.091
IS THAT WE ARE --

02:21:40.158 --> 02:21:42.260
AN APA APPROVED INTERNSHIP

02:21:42.327 --> 02:21:44.596

WERE APPROVED BY THEM WE HAVE --

02:21:50.168 --> 02:21:52.437

INTERNSHIPS LOTS AND AND THAT'S

02:22:00.678 --> 02:22:02.146
BEEN -- IT'S

02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:03.381
A GREAT --

02:22:03.448 --> 02:22:06.251
SERVICE I THINK FOR THE FIELD

02:22:06.317 --> 02:22:07.886
BUT IT'S ALSO A RECRUITMENT TOOL

02:22:07.952 --> 02:22:10.154
AND WE'RE ABLE.

02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:12.557
TO HANG ON TO TO SOME OF OUR

02:22:12.624 --> 02:22:15.393
INTERNS THAT WERE ABLE TO TRAIN

02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:15.693
[inaudible]

02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:20.431
THE SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT

02:22:20.498 --> 02:22:22.567
RELATED TO SKYPE BUT IT DID

02:22:22.634 --> 02:22:24.369
THERE WAS SOME CONNECTION I WAS

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:24.869
GONNA MAKE WELL BUT THE

02:22:24.936 --> 02:22:26.404
CONNECTION I THINK IS THAT THAT

02:22:26.471 --> 02:22:27.572
HAS SOME OF THE COUNTIES AREN'T

02:22:27.639 --> 02:22:28.773
WILLING TO DO THIS WHICH IS

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.642
SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT COULD HELP

02:22:30.708 --> 02:22:32.410
EXPEDITE THE PROCESS AND I THINK.

02:22:32.477 --> 02:22:33.645
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WERE

02:22:33.711 --> 02:22:35.346

02:32:52.162 --> 02:32:53.464
THERE'S PROBABLY STILL SOME

02:32:53.531 --> 02:32:55.132
CONFUSION BUT THE BIGGER PIECES

02:32:55.199 --> 02:32:57.501

02:38:22.526 --> 02:38:23.760
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE AVERAGE

02:38:23.827 --> 02:38:26.096
COST SO IF THE YOUTH IS IN

02:38:26.163 --> 02:38:27.297
PLACEMENT.

02:38:27.364 --> 02:38:30.500
IN A FACILITY FOR SIX MONTHS.

02:38:30.567 --> 02:38:32.569
YOU'RE TALKING AS A SIGNIFICANT

02:38:32.636 --> 02:38:33.904
AMOUNT OF MONEY IN VENTURA

02:38:33.971 --> 02:38:36.773
COUNTY WE WENT TO THE COUNTY --

02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:38.308
EARLY ON AND SAID WE'RE GONNA

02:38:38.375 --> 02:38:39.877
NEED A MILLION MORE IN OUR

02:38:39.943 --> 02:38:42.212
CONTRACT. TO SERVE THESE OUT

02:38:42.279 --> 02:38:45.849
ACCOUNT KIDS AND DATE JUST ABOUT --

02:38:45.916 --> 02:38:47.017
FAINTED.

02:38:47.084 --> 02:38:49.720
AT THAT REQUEST --

02:38:49.786 --> 02:38:52.723
WE WE WOUND UP DOING LESS THAN

02:38:52.789 --> 02:38:55.158
THAN THAT BUT BUT AN AMOUNT THAT

02:38:55.225 --> 02:38:57.094
WE THINK WE CAN MANAGE WITH WHAT

02:38:57.160 --> 02:38:59.429
WHAT HAPPENS OVER TIME I THINK

02:38:59.496 --> 02:39:00.964
THE THINKING HAS BEEN.

02:39:01.031 --> 02:39:02.266
THAT WHAT HAPPENS OVER TIME IS

02:39:02.332 --> 02:39:05.669
THAT BEEN TURKEY CLAIMS.

02:39:05.736 --> 02:39:06.837
BASED -- FOR

02:39:06.904 --> 02:39:08.805
THOSE KIDS WHO WERE NOW THEY ARE

02:39:08.872 --> 02:39:10.407
NOW RESPONSIBLE.

02:39:10.474 --> 02:39:12.042
FOR SO AT OVER TIME THEY'RE

02:39:12.109 --> 02:39:13.810
GOING TO WIND UP GETTING THAT

02:39:13.877 --> 02:39:16.647
MONEY NEXT YEAR'S ALLOCATION IS

02:39:16.713 --> 02:39:18.615
GOING TO BE BASED ON THE AMOUNT

02:39:18.682 --> 02:39:19.816
OF CLAIMS THEY HAVE OF THEIR

02:39:19.883 --> 02:39:20.951
CLAIMS ARE GOING UP.

02:39:21.018 --> 02:39:23.053
SO THE THEORY IS THAT OVER THAT

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:24.788
IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS LET'S

02:39:24.855 --> 02:39:25.489
SAY.

02:39:25.555 --> 02:39:27.891
EVERYTHING'S GONNA EVEN OUT

02:39:27.958 --> 02:39:28.492
BECAUSE THE MONEY DOES FOLLOW

02:39:28.558 --> 02:39:29.660
THE RIGHT.

02:39:29.726 --> 02:39:31.495
BITE BUT BETTER THREE YEARS THEY

02:39:31.561 --> 02:39:32.562
HAD ISSUE.

02:39:32.629 --> 02:39:34.164
THAT COUNTIES ARE FACING IN THE

02:39:34.231 --> 02:39:35.599
MEAN TIME.

02:39:35.666 --> 02:39:37.968
THERE WAS A EFFORT A SOLUTION

02:39:38.035 --> 02:39:40.637
THAT THAT ARE OF ASSOCIATION

02:39:40.704 --> 02:39:43.674
PROPOSAL LAST YEAR SEVENTY FIVE

02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:44.441
MILLION.

02:39:44.508 --> 02:39:46.009
DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND MONEY

02:39:46.076 --> 02:39:48.111
WHICH IT LOOKS LIKE WAS GONNA GO

02:39:48.178 --> 02:39:52.449
PLACES BUT IT DIDN'T.

02:39:52.516 --> 02:39:54.918
FOR SOME REASON HERE --

02:39:54.985 --> 02:39:55.719
I FOUND TO BE A REAL HEALTH

02:39:55.786 --> 02:39:57.988
FOLKS THOUGHT THAT THIS CAL MESA

02:39:58.055 --> 02:40:00.123
IDEA THAT THEY HAD WAS KIND ARE

02:40:00.190 --> 02:40:01.725
GONNA DO IT BUT IN ANY EVENT IT

02:40:01.792 --> 02:40:04.761
IS A IT IS AN ISSUE.

02:40:04.828 --> 02:40:05.629
FOR I WOULD GUESS AT LEAST A

02:40:05.696 --> 02:40:07.431
DOZEN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WHO

02:40:07.497 --> 02:40:09.166
WERE IMPORTING KIDS AND YOU HAVE

02:40:09.232 --> 02:40:10.767
THIS BIG CASH ISSUE RIGHT BUT

02:40:10.834 --> 02:40:13.236
BUT AGAIN USING THE SCHOOL

02:40:13.303 --> 02:40:15.172
ANALOGY --

02:40:15.238 --> 02:40:16.673
WHEN THAT KID WHEN A STUDENT

02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:18.642
TRANSFERS TO ANOTHER DISTRICT

02:40:18.709 --> 02:40:20.010
THAT MONEY IS IMMEDIATE?

02:40:20.077 --> 02:40:20.844
UP ON THE EIGHTY EIGHT AS WELL

02:40:20.911 --> 02:40:25.716
AS THE CUMULATIVE RECORDS ONCE

02:40:25.782 --> 02:40:27.417
THE STUDENT TRANSFERS OVER WE

02:40:27.484 --> 02:40:29.019
ARE REQUIRED I'VE YOU KNOW MANY

02:40:29.086 --> 02:40:30.287
TIMES SIXTEEN YEARS TEACHING I

02:40:30.354 --> 02:40:32.489
HAD TO FILL OUT THE EXIT --

02:40:32.556 --> 02:40:35.292
CUME WITH THE REPORT CARDS AND

02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:36.793
YOU KNOW PROOF OF THE WORK

02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:38.195
SAMPLES AND ALL OF THAT AND KIND

02:40:38.261 --> 02:40:41.398
OF IN A REAL SMALL PARAGRAPH HAS

02:40:41.465 --> 02:40:42.466
TO WHAT.

02:40:42.532 --> 02:40:43.667
ISSUES IF THERE WERE ANY WITH

02:40:43.734 --> 02:40:45.635
THAT STUDENT IN VACUUM GOES TO

02:40:45.702 --> 02:40:47.037
THAT FOLLOWING SCHOOL IN NOW

02:40:47.104 --> 02:40:48.372
GRANTED IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT A

02:40:48.438 --> 02:40:49.006
MONTH.

02:40:49.072 --> 02:40:51.975
BUT IT WOULD MAKE IT THERE AND

02:40:52.042 --> 02:40:53.543
THEN THE FUNDING WAS DIRECTLY.

02:40:53.610 --> 02:40:55.579
I YOU KNOW FOLLOWING THE CHILD

02:40:55.645 --> 02:40:56.947
NOT THREE YEARS LATER AND I

02:40:57.014 --> 02:40:58.648
THINK TO BE DISCUSSED LATER BUT

02:40:58.715 --> 02:41:00.183
THAT'S IF WE CAN DO IT IN THE

02:41:00.250 --> 02:41:02.019
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND CLEARLY THE

02:41:02.085 --> 02:41:03.120
NEED IS SO HIGH.

02:41:03.186 --> 02:41:05.322
IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR THOSE

02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:06.656
COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING A GOOD

02:41:06.723 --> 02:41:08.592
JOB TO GET THE INFLUX OF KIDS

02:41:08.658 --> 02:41:10.394
BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.

02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:12.462
AND THEN NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN

02:41:12.529 --> 02:41:15.632
IT WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS GOING TO

02:41:15.699 --> 02:41:17.801
ERODE YOUR PROGRAM BECAUSE NOW

02:41:17.868 --> 02:41:19.202
YOU DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR

02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:20.437
IT AND SO THE HIGH QUALITY

02:41:20.504 --> 02:41:21.738
SERVICES YOU'RE PROVIDING YOU

02:41:21.805 --> 02:41:23.073
ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:24.674
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

02:41:24.741 --> 02:41:26.476
BUT AGAIN THESE ARE ALL ME

02:41:26.543 --> 02:41:28.111
SPEAKING OUT LOUD IN TRYING TO

02:41:28.178 --> 02:41:30.614
KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT NEXT TIME

02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:32.549
WE CAN REMEMBER YOU KNOW PARTS

02:41:32.616 --> 02:41:34.017

02:41:34.084 --> 02:41:35.352
THE CONVERSATION SO THAT WE CAN

02:41:35.419 --> 02:41:37.521
REALLY MAKE SOME CHANGES. ONE OF

02:41:37.587 --> 02:41:39.423
THE PRACTICAL ISSUES I THINK IS

02:41:39.489 --> 02:41:40.957
GOING TO ULTIMATELY BE THAT.

02:41:41.024 --> 02:41:43.593
THAT BOB PROVIDERS WHO HAVE BEDS

02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:44.728
ARE GONNA SELL THEM TO

SO FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT AT CLC --

02:45:31.621 --> 02:45:33.189
SOME OF THE IMPORTANT POSITIVE

02:45:33.256 --> 02:45:35.692
PIECES OUR THE SHIFT IN OUR

02:45:39.763 --> 02:45:41.464
I UNDERSTAND THAT MENTAL HEALTH

02:45:41.531 --> 02:45:42.899
AFFECTS US ALL AND SHOULD BE

02:45:42.966 --> 02:45:46.036
VIEWED IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY.

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:47.570
A NEW FOCUS ON FINDING A

02:45:47.637 --> 02:45:48.805
PERMANENT HOME FOR EVERY FOSTER

02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:50.507
YOUTH.

02:45:50.573 --> 02:45:52.142
SO INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR A

02:45:52.208 --> 02:45:54.411
CHILD TO STABILIZE BEFORE

02:45:54.477 --> 02:45:56.279
FINDING A HOME WHICH HAS BEEN

02:45:56.346 --> 02:45:57.714
THE PRACTICE PREVIOUSLY.

02:45:57.781 --> 02:45:59.215
NOW WE LOOK FOR A HOME WHERE THE

02:45:59.282 --> 02:46:01.217
CHILD CAN OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN

02:46:01.284 --> 02:46:02.352
STABILITY.

02:46:02.419 --> 02:46:03.787
THEY'RE NOT WAITING TO BE GOOD

02:46:03.853 --> 02:46:05.188
ENOUGH --

02:46:07.757 --> 02:46:08.258
THEY DESERVE A HOME FROM THE

02:46:08.325 --> 02:46:09.893
BEGINNING.

02:46:09.959 --> 02:46:11.061
THE REALIZATION THAT DISCHARGE

02:46:11.127 --> 02:46:12.162
PLANNING IT'S CRITICAL THAT WAS

02:46:12.228 --> 02:46:13.296
SPOKEN -- BY

02:46:13.363 --> 02:46:15.665
THE GENTLEMAN FROM CASA PACIFICA.

02:46:15.732 --> 02:46:16.833
EVERY FOSTER YOUTH WHO ENTERS

02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:18.768

02:46:18.835 --> 02:46:20.103
DISCHARGE PLAN FROM THE DATE OF

02:46:20.170 --> 02:46:21.971
ADMISSION.

02:46:22.038 --> 02:46:23.573
DISCHARGE PLANNING SHOULD BEGIN

02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:25.408
WHEN THE CHILD ENTERS CONGREGATE

02:46:25.475 --> 02:46:26.343
CARE NOT WHEN THEY'RE READY TO

02:46:26.409 --> 02:46:29.045
TRANSITION.

02:46:29.112 --> 02:46:30.747
UNLESS FOCUS ON DIAGNOSIS.

02:46:30.814 --> 02:46:31.815
DIAGNOSIS AND BEHAVIORAL

02:46:31.881 --> 02:46:33.350
PROBLEMS AND MORE FOCUS ON

02:46:33.416 --> 02:46:35.185
STRENGTH.

02:46:35.251 --> 02:46:36.586
AND FUTURE POSSIBILITY OF EVERY

02:46:36.653 --> 02:46:39.823
CHILD.

02:46:39.889 --> 02:46:41.157
ALLOWING THE CHILD TO DRIVE THE

02:46:41.224 --> 02:46:42.726
CFT PROCESS RATHER THAN THE

02:46:42.792 --> 02:46:45.128
AGENCY PROFESSIONALS COURSE.

02:46:45.195 --> 02:46:47.464

02:46:49.332 --> 02:46:51.201
THEIR LIVES AND SOMETIMES AGENCY

02:46:51.267 --> 02:46:52.435
PROFESSIONALS BUT THE SEA OF TO

02:46:52.502 --> 02:46:53.837
PROCESS SHOULD BE.

02:46:53.903 --> 02:46:55.839
DRIVEN BY THE CHILD.

02:46:55.905 --> 02:46:57.140
SOME OF THE ONGOING CHALLENGES

02:46:57.207 --> 02:46:59.943
THAT WE SEE IN COURT EVERYDAY --

02:47:00.009 --> 02:47:01.778
OF C. C. R. INCLUDE THE RFA

02:47:01.845 --> 02:47:03.480
PROCESS WHICH HAS MADE IT MORE

02:47:03.546 --> 02:47:05.348
CUMBERSOME FOR RELATIVES TO

02:47:05.415 --> 02:47:06.850
BECOME APPROVED CARE GIVERS.

02:47:06.916 --> 02:47:08.752
THE DELAY --

02:47:08.818 --> 02:47:10.220
IN APPROVAL THESE CHILDREN IN

02:47:10.286 --> 02:47:11.788
FOSTER HOMES ARE CONGREGATE CARE

02:47:11.855 --> 02:47:13.423
FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.

02:47:13.490 --> 02:47:14.557
AND LEAVES CARE GIVERS WITHOUT

02:47:14.624 --> 02:47:18.695

02:47:18.762 --> 02:47:20.029
DISCHARGE FROM S. YOUR CHEAPEST

02:47:20.096 --> 02:47:21.331
FACILITIES WHICH WERE STARTING

02:47:21.398 --> 02:47:23.133
TO SEE NOW BECAUSE THE SIX MONTH

02:47:23.199 --> 02:47:25.502
TIME FRAME HAS STARTED TO RUN ON

02:47:25.568 --> 02:47:26.336
A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE BEEN

02:47:26.403 --> 02:47:28.138

02:47:28.204 --> 02:47:29.072
FACILITIES.

02:47:29.139 --> 02:47:30.540
SO ALTHOUGH THE STAYS ARE MEANT

02:47:30.607 --> 02:47:31.608
TO BE LIMITED IN TIME THERE ARE

02:47:31.674 --> 02:47:33.042
FEW SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO

02:47:35.712 --> 02:47:37.680
SO AS COUNSEL FOR THE CHILD WE

02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:39.883
NEED LEVERAGE --

02:47:39.949 --> 02:47:40.917

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CCIR.

02:47:49.826 --> 02:47:50.860
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT THERE IS A

02:47:50.927 --> 02:47:52.495
GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO

CLIENTS AS WE NEED THE REGIONAL

02:50:57.647 --> 02:50:58.681
CENTER WE NEED GREATER

02:50:58.748 --> 02:50:59.916
COLLABORATION FROM THE REGIONAL

02:50:59.983 --> 02:51:01.851
CENTER AGENCIES. TO PROVIDE

02:51:01.918 --> 02:51:02.418
SERVICES TARGETED TO ME OUR

02:51:02.485 --> 02:51:05.388
CLIENTS NEEDS --

02:51:05.455 --> 02:51:06.789
AT HOT WEATHER THERE AT HOME OR

02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:07.924
IN CARE.

02:51:07.991 --> 02:51:09.692
SO THAT IS ALSO A STRUGGLE --

02:51:09.759 --> 02:51:10.760
CLIENTS THAT HAVE BOTH A

02:51:10.827 --> 02:51:12.729
DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY AND A MENTAL

02:51:12.795 --> 02:51:14.464
HEALTH DIAGNOSIS.

02:51:14.530 --> 02:51:16.933
ARE MUCH GREATER RISK TO SPEND

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:18.468
MUCH MORE TIME OUT OF THE HOME

02:51:18.534 --> 02:51:20.203
AND IN CONGREGATE CARE.

02:51:20.269 --> 02:51:21.638
SO -- WE

02:51:21.704 --> 02:51:22.338
HAVE ALL SORTS OF LEGAL

02:51:22.405 --> 02:51:23.973
STRATEGIES AT OUR DISPOSAL WE

02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:25.208
CAN SUBPOENA THE REGIONAL CENTER

02:51:25.274 --> 02:51:26.442
AND JOIN THE REGIONAL CENTER BUT

02:51:26.509 --> 02:51:27.677
IT IS A CHALLENGE TO GET.

02:51:27.744 --> 02:51:28.811
THE REGIONAL CENTER TO

02:51:28.878 --> 02:51:30.980
PARTICIPATE FROM THE BEGINNING --

02:51:31.047 --> 02:51:32.749
IT'S INSTEAD OF IT BEING A FIGHT

02:51:32.815 --> 02:51:34.817
TO KIND OF GET INVOLVEMENT --

02:51:34.884 --> 02:51:36.285
AND FIND APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT.

02:51:36.352 --> 02:51:38.688
SO OUR CLIENTS THAT HAVE MENTAL

02:51:38.755 --> 02:51:39.489
HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT ARE

02:51:39.555 --> 02:51:40.890
DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED NEED A

02:51:40.957 --> 02:51:42.925
DIFFERENT KIND OF TREATMENT IT

02:51:42.992 --> 02:51:43.526
NEEDS TO BE TARGETED TO THEIR

02:51:43.593 --> 02:51:44.360
OWN.

02:51:44.427 --> 02:51:46.162
DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS AND SO

02:51:46.229 --> 02:51:47.630
SOMETIMES IT TAKES A SPECIAL

02:51:47.697 --> 02:51:50.233
KIND OF KIND OF INTERVENTION --

02:51:50.299 --> 02:51:51.668
ONE FINAL IMPORTANT ADVOCACY

02:51:51.734 --> 02:51:53.770
CONCERN IS I HEARD DISCUSSION

02:51:53.836 --> 02:51:54.937
EARLIER ABOUT THE MATTER

02:51:55.004 --> 02:51:56.205
ASSESSMENT WHEN.

02:51:56.272 --> 02:51:58.608
LA COUNTY DCFS.

02:51:58.675 --> 02:52:00.009
WAS SPEAKING --

02:52:00.076 --> 02:52:01.277
WE DON'T GET THE INFORMATION

02:52:01.344 --> 02:52:02.178
ABOUT OUR CLIENTS HEALTH AND

02:52:02.245 --> 02:52:03.446
MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AT THE TIME

02:52:03.513 --> 02:52:04.781
THAT THE COURT MAKES THE

02:52:04.847 --> 02:52:06.215
DISPOSITION PLAN.

02:52:06.282 --> 02:52:07.917
SO EVERY CHILD THAT COMES AND

02:52:07.984 --> 02:52:09.018
FAMILY THAT COMES THROUGH THE

02:52:09.085 --> 02:52:10.586
COURT SYSTEM --

02:52:10.653 --> 02:52:13.623
AT DETENTION THE JUDGE ORDERS --

02:52:13.690 --> 02:52:17.493
A HUB WHICH IS THE MEDICAL.

02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:19.162
EXAM AND A MAP ASSESSMENT.

02:52:19.228 --> 02:52:20.129
THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S A

02:52:20.196 --> 02:52:21.898
DISPOSITION CASE PLAN THAT'S

02:52:21.964 --> 02:52:23.299
MADE FOR THE FAMILY THAT ORDERS

02:52:23.366 --> 02:52:25.735
PARENTS INTO CERTAIN --

02:52:25.802 --> 02:52:27.236
CLASSES IN PARENTING AS WELL AS

02:52:27.303 --> 02:52:29.005
FOR THE CHILD AND WE DON'T HAVE

02:52:29.072 --> 02:52:29.706
THE HEALTH.

02:52:29.772 --> 02:52:30.840
DEVELOPMENTAL OR MENTAL HEALTH

02:52:30.907 --> 02:52:33.176
INFORMATION WE NEED BEFORE MAKE

02:52:33.242 --> 02:52:35.044
THAT DISPOSITION CASE PLAN AND

02:52:35.111 --> 02:52:35.678
SOMETIMES WE DON'T EVER GET THE

02:52:35.745 --> 02:52:38.481
MATTER.

02:52:38.548 --> 02:52:40.516
SO THAT MEANS THAT THE THE THE

02:52:40.583 --> 02:52:41.851
NEEDS OF THE CHILD OR THE

02:52:41.918 --> 02:52:43.119
ADOLESCENT OR THE NON MY DEPEND

02:52:43.186 --> 02:52:44.754
ARE COMING UP KIND OF WHEN THEY

02:52:44.821 --> 02:52:46.823
COME UP IN THE COURT REPORTS ARE

02:52:46.889 --> 02:52:47.623
BECAUSE OF BEHAVIORAL ISSUES AND

02:52:47.690 --> 02:52:48.291
NOT.

02:52:48.357 --> 02:52:49.592
ON THE FRONT END AND IT'S

02:52:49.659 --> 02:52:50.693
SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:52.295
FOR MANY YEARS AND DON'T SEEM TO

02:52:52.361 --> 02:52:53.329
HAVE BE ABLE.

02:52:53.396 --> 02:52:54.864
TO MOVE THAT FORWARD IT'S PART

02:52:54.931 --> 02:52:56.499
OF THE READ PART OF IT IS

02:52:56.566 --> 02:52:57.934
BECAUSE OF THE DELAY --

02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:59.102
I MEAN ABOUT ASSESSMENT TIME

02:52:59.168 --> 02:53:00.236
FRAME DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH THE

02:53:00.303 --> 02:53:03.306
JUDICIAL TIME FRAME AND SO THERE

02:53:03.372 --> 02:53:05.475
IS A LACK OF INFORMATION --

02:53:05.541 --> 02:53:06.843
SO THESE ARE JUST SOME OF AND I

02:53:06.909 --> 02:53:09.579
AM JUST VERY GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE

02:53:09.645 --> 02:53:11.180
TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH TO

02:53:11.247 --> 02:53:12.749
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

02:53:12.815 --> 02:53:14.283
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES MENTAL HEALTH

02:53:14.350 --> 02:53:15.284
IS NOT --

02:53:15.351 --> 02:53:18.454
ARE REALLY POPULAR CONVERSATION

02:53:18.521 --> 02:53:20.089
SO THIS IS A REAL.

02:53:20.156 --> 02:53:21.424
THIS IS GREAT FOR ME OF BEING ON

02:53:21.491 --> 02:53:23.126
THE FRONT LINES EVERYDAY WORKING

02:53:23.192 --> 02:53:24.227
WITH KIDS AND FAMILIES.

02:53:24.293 --> 02:53:25.261
A DAY IN AND DAY OUT IT'S JUST

02:53:25.328 --> 02:53:26.829
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO COME IN AND

02:53:26.896 --> 02:53:28.231
SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF MY UP

02:53:28.297 --> 02:53:30.066
KIND OF MY WISH LIST AND HOPES

02:53:30.133 --> 02:53:31.267
FOR THE FUTURE SO THANK YOU SO

02:53:31.334 --> 02:53:34.103

02:53:34.170 --> 02:53:37.006
THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS.

02:53:37.073 --> 02:53:39.342

02:53:41.644 --> 02:53:43.713
AND ALL OF US HAVE TO DO A

02:53:43.780 --> 02:53:44.347
BETTER JOB OF TALKING ABOUT IT

02:53:44.413 --> 02:53:45.782
MORE -- I

02:53:45.848 --> 02:53:46.382
WANTED TO SPECIFICALLY ASK YOU

02:53:46.449 --> 02:53:49.418

IS THAT GETTING ANY BETTER THEIR

02:53:54.657 --> 02:53:57.226
IT'S SLOW AND SO.

02:53:57.293 --> 02:53:59.796
I THINK THAT PEOPLE WANT CARE

02:53:59.862 --> 02:54:01.030
GIVERS TO BE APPROVED THE

02:54:01.097 --> 02:54:03.199
PROBLEM IS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

02:54:03.266 --> 02:54:04.901
ALREADY TODAY IF THERE'S A

02:54:04.967 --> 02:54:07.103
THERE'S A IT SEEMS LIKE THE BEST

02:54:07.170 --> 02:54:08.704
A RELATIVES AND GRANDPARENTS AND

02:54:08.771 --> 02:54:09.739
THE BEST PEOPLE THE MOST

02:54:09.806 --> 02:54:10.873
COMMITTED PEOPLE.

02:54:10.940 --> 02:54:12.008
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY TAKE THE

02:54:12.074 --> 02:54:13.810
LONGEST TO GET ACTUALLY THE

02:54:13.876 --> 02:54:14.443
MONEY THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF

02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:15.344
THE CHILD.

02:54:15.411 --> 02:54:17.013
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE SO GREAT AND

02:54:17.079 --> 02:54:18.748
EVERYONE'S SO POSITIVE AND YOU

02:54:18.815 --> 02:54:20.149
KNOW ABOUT THEM WE DON'T BUT WE

02:54:20.216 --> 02:54:21.584
DON'T SUPPORT THEM THEY STILL

02:54:21.651 --> 02:54:23.219
NEED THE FUNDING AND THEY NEED

02:54:23.286 --> 02:54:25.354
THE RESOURCES AND SO WE GET HUNG

02:54:25.421 --> 02:54:26.088
UP.

02:54:26.155 --> 02:54:27.590
THE IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETIMES THE

02:54:27.657 --> 02:54:29.292
COUNTY AGENCIES CAN GET HUNG UP

02:54:29.358 --> 02:54:31.294
ON DOTTING THE I'S AND CROSSING

02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:33.029
THE T.'S SEE IN THE OLD DAYS WE

02:54:33.095 --> 02:54:35.031
ONLY NEEDED A A CLEAN KHAKI IN A

02:54:35.097 --> 02:54:36.833
CLASS. TO PLACE WITH A RELATIVE

02:54:36.899 --> 02:54:38.634
SO WE WENT THROUGH THOSE DAYS

02:54:38.701 --> 02:54:40.703
WHERE IT WAS MUCH EASIER FROM

02:54:40.770 --> 02:54:42.438
THE FROM DETENTION TO GET A

02:54:42.505 --> 02:54:44.340
CHILD WITH FAMILY SO GETTING A

02:54:44.407 --> 02:54:45.775
CHILD WITH FAMILY SO NOW WE HAVE

02:54:45.842 --> 02:54:47.677
LIKE A HOLDOVER WHERE DO WE PUT

02:54:47.743 --> 02:54:48.744
THEM.

02:54:48.811 --> 02:54:50.479
BEFORE THEY GO WITH FAMILY AND

02:54:50.546 --> 02:54:51.781
THEY WERE SHOULD BE WITH FAMILY

02:54:51.848 --> 02:54:53.049
FROM THE BEGINNING I MEAN THE

02:54:53.115 --> 02:54:54.450
LESS DISRUPTION.

02:54:54.517 --> 02:54:56.485

FAMILIES TO BE BEARING THE COST

02:55:08.831 --> 02:55:09.765
FOR THAT LONG.

YA I'VE BEEN AT THE SHOP FOR

02:57:01.744 --> 02:57:03.212
EIGHTEEN YEARS AND I DON'T THINK

02:57:03.279 --> 02:57:04.680
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT VERY MUCH

02:57:04.747 --> 02:57:05.548

02:57:05.614 --> 02:57:06.349
WE'VE BEEN.

02:57:06.415 --> 02:57:07.850
I THINK SEEING --

02:57:07.917 --> 02:57:09.352
THROUGH KATIE A THROUGH THE

02:57:09.418 --> 02:57:11.220
PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS ISSUE

UPPED IF THERE ARE THE YOUTH ARE

02:57:22.365 --> 02:57:23.199

02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:25.034
FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN

02:57:25.101 --> 02:57:26.702
I THINK NOW MOVING TO SUCH A

02:57:26.769 --> 02:57:28.604
DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF TRAUMA

02:57:28.671 --> 02:57:29.372
AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

02:57:29.438 --> 02:57:30.906
EXPERIENCES AND HOW THAT AFFECTS

02:57:30.973 --> 02:57:32.041
THE YOUTH THAT WE SERVE.

02:57:32.108 --> 02:57:33.442
EVEN JUST BEING REMOVED FROM THE

02:57:33.509 --> 02:57:35.244
HOME AS A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE

02:57:35.311 --> 02:57:37.179
THAT CAN LEAD TO THE NEED FOR

02:57:37.246 --> 02:57:39.415
SOME SERVICES RELATED TO THAT --

02:57:39.482 --> 02:57:40.950

02:57:44.587 --> 02:57:46.255
OUTSIDE OF THAT --

02:57:46.322 --> 02:57:46.822
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:57:46.889 --> 02:57:48.257

THAT ASSESSMENT ON THE SORT OF

02:58:56.258 --> 02:58:57.660
CHILD WELFARE SIDE AND THEN THEY

02:59:19.515 --> 02:59:20.182
BASIS.

02:59:20.249 --> 02:59:21.150
I THINK --

02:59:21.217 --> 02:59:22.518
WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN AND YOU'VE

02:59:22.585 --> 02:59:23.519

02:59:23.586 --> 02:59:25.888
TODAY IS WITH THE PASSAGE OF

02:59:25.955 --> 02:59:26.856
EIGHTY THREE FORTY BY DOCTOR

02:59:26.922 --> 02:59:28.357
ARAMBULA A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO?

02:59:28.424 --> 02:59:30.392
THAT IS A BILL THAT REQUIRES THE

02:59:30.459 --> 02:59:31.827
SCREENING TOOLS THAT BAD THAT

02:59:31.894 --> 02:59:33.496
DOCTORS USE THROUGH THE EARLY

02:59:33.562 --> 02:59:35.164
AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS

02:59:35.231 --> 02:59:37.366
AND TREATMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A

02:59:37.433 --> 02:59:40.169
REQUIREMENT UNDER MEDICAID AND

02:59:40.236 --> 02:59:43.372
ALL OF SIR CARE.

02:59:43.439 --> 02:59:44.907
ON IT APPLIES --

02:59:44.974 --> 02:59:46.542
TO CHANGING THE SCREENING TOOLS

02:59:46.609 --> 02:59:47.042
FOR THE ENTIRE MEDICAID

02:59:47.109 --> 02:59:49.145
POPULATION EVERY CHILD THAT WE

02:59:49.211 --> 02:59:50.312
SEE IS ENTITLED TO THESE

02:59:50.379 --> 02:59:51.247
SERVICES.

02:59:51.313 --> 02:59:52.815
ARE ARE FOSTER CHILDREN YOUTH

02:59:52.882 --> 02:59:54.316
ARE SUBSET OF THAT AND SO YOU

02:59:54.383 --> 02:59:55.484
KNOW WE'VE GONE FARTHER I THINK

02:59:55.551 --> 02:59:57.453
WITHOUT LEGISLATION TO INCLUDE

02:59:57.520 --> 02:59:58.787
ALL OF THE CHILDREN BUT

02:59:58.854 --> 03:00:00.322
CERTAINLY FOR OUR CHILDREN YOUTH

03:00:00.389 --> 03:00:01.724
WHERE WE KNOW THAT THAT TRAUMA

03:00:01.790 --> 03:00:02.725
HAS BEEN --

03:00:02.791 --> 03:00:04.927
LIKELY IN SOME FASHION ON

03:00:04.994 --> 03:00:06.795
EXPERIENCE TO A GREATER OR

03:00:06.862 --> 03:00:08.430
LESSER DEGREE BUT TO SOME DEGREE

03:00:08.497 --> 03:00:09.632
MAKING SURE THAT WERE ASKING THE

03:00:09.698 --> 03:00:10.900
RIGHT QUESTIONS AT THE RIGHT

03:00:10.966 --> 03:00:12.334
POINTS IN TIME FOR THE CHILDREN

03:00:12.401 --> 03:00:13.669
YOU CAN IDENTIFY THINK.

03:00:13.736 --> 03:00:15.571
EVEN FASTER AT THE AT THE SORT

03:00:15.638 --> 03:00:17.072
OF DOCTOR PRACTITIONER LEVEL

03:00:17.139 --> 03:00:19.408
THAT SOMETHING'S GOING ON WITH

03:00:19.475 --> 03:00:20.943
THESE CHILDREN --

03:00:21.010 --> 03:00:23.045
I THINK ON THE COORDINATION OF

03:00:23.112 --> 03:00:25.781
SERVICES I THINK THE EFFORTS ARE

03:00:25.848 --> 03:00:27.583
CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THIS WE

03:00:27.650 --> 03:00:29.785
ARE HEARING TODAY AND I THINK

03:00:29.852 --> 03:00:31.353
YOU SEE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES

03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:32.755
ACROSS DIFFERENT COUNTIES.

03:00:32.821 --> 03:00:34.623
AND THEY ARE SEEKING THEIR BEST

03:00:34.690 --> 03:00:35.991
TO MAKE IT WORK --

03:00:36.058 --> 03:00:36.959
I THINK IT'SSTILL NOT FULLY

03:00:37.026 --> 03:00:38.694
WHERE WE'D LIKE IT AS FAR AS

03:00:38.761 --> 03:00:40.162
MAKING SURE THAT OUR TIME LINES

03:00:40.229 --> 03:00:41.397
ARE ON THE SAME I THINK YOU JUST

03:00:41.463 --> 03:00:41.630
HEARD.

03:00:41.697 --> 03:00:43.165
SOMETIMES WE DON'T GET THOSE

03:00:43.232 --> 03:00:44.967
ASSESSMENTS RIGHT AWAY OR OUR

03:00:45.034 --> 03:00:46.435
CHILD WELFARE AND THE COURT

03:00:46.502 --> 03:00:48.704
PROCESS IS ON PERHAPS A FASTER

03:00:48.771 --> 03:00:50.239
TIMELINE THEN THE BEHAVIORAL

03:00:50.306 --> 03:00:51.373
HEALTH SYSTEM AB.

03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:52.775
AND MENTIONING THAT DIVERT

03:00:52.841 --> 03:00:53.943
DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEM THE

03:00:54.009 --> 03:00:55.678
REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IS EVEN A

03:00:55.744 --> 03:00:58.180
LONGER SET OF TIME LINES AND YOU

03:00:58.247 --> 03:00:59.848
CAN HAVE CO OCCURRING ISSUES YOU

03:00:59.915 --> 03:01:00.916
CAN HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL

03:01:00.983 --> 03:01:02.284
DISABILITY OF SOME KIND.

03:01:02.351 --> 03:01:03.452
AND BE ELIGIBLE FOR REGIONAL

03:01:03.519 --> 03:01:05.421
CENTER SERVICES AND ALSO HAVE A

03:01:05.487 --> 03:01:06.989
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE THAT COULD

03:01:07.056 --> 03:01:08.557
BE TREATED THROUGH THE

03:01:08.624 --> 03:01:10.025
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM AS WELL

03:01:10.092 --> 03:01:11.227
AS ALL OF THOSE THINGS REALLY

03:01:11.293 --> 03:01:12.761
NEED TO KIND OF CLICKED TOGETHER.

03:01:12.828 --> 03:01:14.230
TO MAKE IT WORK FOR CHILDREN I

03:01:14.296 --> 03:01:17.566
DO WANNA GIVE A LITTLE PLUG --

03:01:17.633 --> 03:01:18.133
FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY WE

03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:21.770
WORK TO GET SHARE THIS IS --

03:01:21.837 --> 03:01:23.405
AIMED AT THE HIGHEST NEED THE

03:01:23.472 --> 03:01:25.641
MOST TRAUMATIZE YOU IT'S NOT THE

03:01:25.708 --> 03:01:26.508
MAJORITY OF THE YOUTH THAT WE

03:01:26.575 --> 03:01:28.110
SERVE BUT IT'S THOSE THAT ARE

03:01:28.177 --> 03:01:29.578
RECEIVING SERVICES ARE NEED TO

03:01:29.645 --> 03:01:30.579
BE RECEIVING SERVICES ACROSS

03:01:30.646 --> 03:01:31.914
MULTIPLE SYSTEMS.

03:01:31.981 --> 03:01:33.582
AND IT HASN'T BEEN WORKING AS

03:01:33.649 --> 03:01:35.084
WELL AS IT COULD AND SO THIS

03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:37.219
LEGISLATION WHICH WAS SIGNED --

03:01:37.286 --> 03:01:38.487
WAS VERY HAPPY ABOUT --

03:01:38.554 --> 03:01:39.588
SO WE'RE JUST ON THE FRONT END

03:01:39.655 --> 03:01:41.023
OF IT BUT THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO

03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:42.725
GET LOCALLY SOME RULES OF

03:01:42.791 --> 03:01:43.993
ENGAGEMENT SET OUT FOR WHAT

03:01:44.059 --> 03:01:45.628
HAPPENS WHEN ONE OF THOSE HIGHLY

03:01:45.694 --> 03:01:46.762
TRAUMATIZE YOUTH.

03:01:46.829 --> 03:01:47.730
COURT WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED

03:01:47.796 --> 03:01:49.298
SERVICES ACROSS SYSTEMS AND THAT

03:01:49.365 --> 03:01:51.767
INCLUDES EDUCATION DD IN THE

03:01:51.834 --> 03:01:52.601
REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM AS WELL

03:01:52.668 --> 03:01:55.004

THE TABLE THAT WE DON'T ALREADY

03:02:01.443 --> 03:02:03.145

03:02:05.914 --> 03:02:06.749
PROVIDED TO THOSE HERE.

03:02:06.815 --> 03:02:07.549
THERE'S ALSO A STATE LEVEL

03:02:07.616 --> 03:02:09.285
COMPONENT TO THAT AS WELL WHICH

03:02:09.351 --> 03:02:10.919
WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT TO

CONTINUE SOME DISCUSSIONS THAT

03:02:12.221 --> 03:02:13.822
STARTED LATE IN THE SESSION AT

03:02:19.528 --> 03:02:21.864
PLAYERS AROUND THE TABLE TO SEE

03:02:21.930 --> 03:02:23.265
WHY DON'T OUR TIMELINES MATCH UP

03:02:23.332 --> 03:02:25.000
IS THERE A SITUATION WE CAN MAKE

03:02:25.067 --> 03:02:26.268
SOME CHANGES TO POLICY TO MAKE

03:02:27.303 --> 03:02:28.237
AT THE BEGINNING OF A JOURNEY ON

03:02:28.304 --> 03:02:29.838
THAT AND THINKING ABOUT HOW THAT

03:02:29.905 --> 03:02:30.973

PART OF IT I DON'T THINK WAS SO

03:04:24.253 --> 03:04:26.021
MUCH THE FACT THAT OF THE WE'RE

03:04:26.088 --> 03:04:27.656

AMOUNT THE CASE WORK.

03:04:30.192 --> 03:04:32.361

A MAD THE BIG LOADS OF OF THIS

03:04:37.266 --> 03:04:38.434
CASE WORK THAT THEY'RE

03:04:41.336 --> 03:04:44.673
POINT OF THAT GOT THAT IN A MADE --

03:04:44.740 --> 03:04:46.642
WEEK WE CAN TRAIN THEM BUT IF

03:04:46.708 --> 03:04:48.076

03:04:48.143 --> 03:04:50.679
LOAD HOW DO THEY DECIDE WHO IS

03:04:50.746 --> 03:04:52.514
FIRST AND WHO IS SECOND AND WHO

03:04:52.581 --> 03:04:53.615

GO TO A THEY DON'T FEEL

03:04:54.650 --> 03:04:56.652
SUPPORTED BECAUSE THERE REALLY

03:04:56.718 --> 03:05:00.088
AREN'T I MEAN IF YOU HAVE. FIFTY

03:05:00.155 --> 03:05:01.523
TWO ONE I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF

03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:02.558
OUT OF HAND WHICH GOES BACK TO

03:05:02.624 --> 03:05:04.026
THE I THOUGHT THAT VICIOUS

03:05:04.092 --> 03:05:05.227
CIRCLE GOES BACK TO THE FUNDING

03:05:05.294 --> 03:05:06.462
IF WE DON'T FIND THEM PROPERTY

03:05:06.528 --> 03:05:07.629
THEN THE CASE --

03:05:07.696 --> 03:05:08.697
KEEPS GOING UP AND UP AND UP AND

03:05:08.764 --> 03:05:10.599
THEN NOT ONLY ARE THE CASE

03:05:10.666 --> 03:05:13.001
WORKERS OVERWHELMED BUT THAT THE

03:05:13.068 --> 03:05:14.136
KIDS ARE NOT GETTING THE THE

03:05:14.203 --> 03:05:15.170
SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED

03:05:15.237 --> 03:05:16.271
ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE THE SORT OF

03:05:16.338 --> 03:05:18.040
BOTTOM LINE AS AM I SERVING ALL

03:05:18.106 --> 03:05:19.441
OF THE YOUTH THAT I NEED TO BE

03:05:19.508 --> 03:05:20.108
SERVING IN.

03:05:20.175 --> 03:05:22.144
A WAY THAT I FEEL GOOD ABOUT AND

03:05:22.211 --> 03:05:24.213
IT IN MANY PLACES IT'S JUST NOT

03:05:24.279 --> 03:05:25.614
POSSIBLE AND I THINK WE'RE

03:05:25.681 --> 03:05:27.149
SEEING FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE

03:05:27.216 --> 03:05:28.650
EXTENDED FOSTER CARE POPULATION.

03:05:28.717 --> 03:05:30.319
THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE MADE

03:05:30.385 --> 03:05:31.753
ABOUT HOW MUCH --

03:05:31.820 --> 03:05:34.423
SOCIAL WORK SERVICE WOULD BE

03:05:34.490 --> 03:05:35.624
NEEDED BY THESE ADULTS YOU KNOW

03:05:35.691 --> 03:05:38.494
I THINK WHEN WE WERE DOING AB

03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:40.195
TWELVE TEN YEARS AGO TEN PLUS --

03:05:40.262 --> 03:05:42.097
SO HE EIGHT EIGHT YEARS AGO --

03:05:42.164 --> 03:05:44.867
WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW THEY'RE

03:05:44.933 --> 03:05:47.669
ADULTS ANOTHER HERE'S THE YOU

03:05:47.736 --> 03:05:48.570
KNOW KIND OF PERCENTAGES THAT WE

03:05:48.637 --> 03:05:50.372
ASSUME BASED ON ILLINOIS AND

03:05:50.439 --> 03:05:52.307
WE'VE SEEN OUR PARTICIPATION

03:05:52.374 --> 03:05:54.209
RATES WELL PAST THAT WE SORT OF

03:05:54.276 --> 03:05:55.777
BLEW THROUGH THOSE ORIGINAL.

03:05:55.844 --> 03:05:57.546
ESTIMATES AND I THINK THE

03:05:57.613 --> 03:05:59.715
ESTIMATES OF HOW --

03:05:59.781 --> 03:06:01.683
READY THOSE YOUTH WOULD BE TO

03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:03.252
KIND OF DO IT ON THEIR OWN WITH

03:06:03.318 --> 03:06:03.819
JUST A LITTLE HELP FROM US

03:06:03.886 --> 03:06:04.953
FINANCIALLY --

03:06:05.020 --> 03:06:07.122
WE'VE BEEN TALKING INTERNALLY AS

03:06:07.189 --> 03:06:08.223
WELL ABOUT HOW DO WE LOOK AT

03:06:08.290 --> 03:06:10.359
THAT AREA OF SOCIAL WORK AND OUR

03:06:10.425 --> 03:06:11.827
ASSUMPTIONS ARE AND HOW MANY

03:06:11.894 --> 03:06:13.262
CASES THEY WOULD HANDLE UP

03:06:13.328 --> 03:06:15.197
VERSES THE REALITY OF THE WORK

03:06:15.264 --> 03:06:16.798
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO REALLY.

03:06:16.865 --> 03:06:18.300
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST

03:06:18.367 --> 03:06:18.901
DROPPING THIS YOUTH OFTEN OF

03:06:18.967 --> 03:06:20.969
ANOTHER A CLIFF WHEN THEY TURN

03:06:21.036 --> 03:06:22.137
TWENTY ONE SO IT'S A DEFINITE

03:06:22.204 --> 03:06:24.039
ONGOING ISSUE AND I WANT TO SAY

03:06:24.106 --> 03:06:25.474
TO WORK THINKING ABOUT AT THE

03:06:25.541 --> 03:06:26.942
PRACTITIONER LEVEL --

03:06:27.009 --> 03:06:28.043
AND I KNOW IT WAS MENTIONED IN A

03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:29.711
COUPLE OF THE PANELS --

03:06:29.778 --> 03:06:32.114
INSURING THAT WE HAVE THERAPIST

03:06:32.180 --> 03:06:34.883
DOCTORS ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT CAN

03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:36.552
SERVE OUR YOUTH AND THERE'S

03:06:36.618 --> 03:06:38.220
WAITING LISTS THERE'S A SHORTAGE

03:06:38.287 --> 03:06:39.688
OF PROVIDERS IT DEPENDS ON WHERE

03:06:39.755 --> 03:06:41.223
YOU LIVE IF YOU CAN GET INTO --

03:06:41.290 --> 03:06:43.292
ONE MORE REGULARLY AND SO

03:06:43.358 --> 03:06:45.494
THINKING ABOUT WAYS AND THIS IS

03:06:45.561 --> 03:06:47.396
ONE OF THE TASKS AND TWENTY

03:06:47.462 --> 03:06:47.996
EIGHTY THREE AS FOR THAT STATE

03:06:48.063 --> 03:06:48.964
LEVEL GROUP TO SAY.

03:06:49.031 --> 03:06:51.266
HOW DO WE GROW HOW DO WE YOU

03:06:51.333 --> 03:06:53.569
KNOW CREATE MORE TRAUMA INFORMED

03:06:53.635 --> 03:06:54.903
PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE ABLE TO

03:06:54.970 --> 03:06:57.072
SERVE OUR YOUTH BECAUSE HAVING --

03:06:57.139 --> 03:06:59.308
AN IDENTIFIED NEED IS GREAT BUT

03:06:59.374 --> 03:07:00.676
NOT IF YOU CAN'T TREAT IT FOR

03:07:00.742 --> 03:07:02.244
MONTHS AND GET SOMEBODY AND ON A

03:07:02.311 --> 03:07:03.879
REGULAR BASIS TO RECEIVE THAT

03:07:03.946 --> 03:07:05.647
ONGOING SERVICE --

03:07:05.714 --> 03:07:06.848
I THINK JUST ONE OTHER THING

03:07:06.915 --> 03:07:09.084
THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION IS --

03:07:09.151 --> 03:07:10.852
THE THE SORT OF POLL COUPLE

03:07:10.919 --> 03:07:12.521
THINGS ABOUT THE PROMISE OF CCIR

03:07:12.588 --> 03:07:14.089
THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FORM ONE

03:07:14.156 --> 03:07:15.857
OF THE IMPORTANT PROMISES THAT I

03:07:15.924 --> 03:07:16.992
THINK WAS MADE IN THE

03:07:17.059 --> 03:07:17.726
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ARE

03:07:17.793 --> 03:07:18.493
TALKING ABOUT.

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:21.964
WHAT THE STATE WITH THE

03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:24.866
LEGISLATURE WITH COUNTY HE IS

03:07:24.933 --> 03:07:26.201
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ALL GOING TO

03:07:26.268 --> 03:07:27.869
BE AND THAT SORT OF GROUP CARE

03:07:27.936 --> 03:07:29.371
MODEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

03:07:29.438 --> 03:07:31.039
CONTINUUM AND WE'RE GONNA STEP

03:07:31.106 --> 03:07:31.974
YOUTH AND THE FAMILIES ARE GOING

03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:33.141
TO KEEP THEM IN FAMILIES?

03:07:33.208 --> 03:07:34.476
AND FAMILY TYPES OF PROVIDERS

03:07:34.543 --> 03:07:35.744
LIKE A RELATIVE CARE GIVERS ARE

03:07:35.811 --> 03:07:37.312
A FAMILY HOME TO THE GREATEST

03:07:37.379 --> 03:07:38.847
EXTENT POSSIBLE AND WE ARE GOING

03:07:38.914 --> 03:07:39.982
TO BRING THOSE SERVICES TO THEM.

03:07:40.048 --> 03:07:40.749
THEY'RE GOING TO GET THOSE

03:07:40.816 --> 03:07:41.750
SERVICES THAT ARE NOT GOING TO

03:07:41.817 --> 03:07:43.485
HAVE TO FAIL OUT OR HAVE THE

03:07:43.552 --> 03:07:45.253
COPS CALLED ON THEM AND HAVE

03:07:45.320 --> 03:07:47.055
THEM AND UP IN A CONGREGATE CARE

03:07:47.122 --> 03:07:47.889
FACILITY.

03:07:47.956 --> 03:07:49.291
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY

03:07:49.358 --> 03:07:51.159
SEEKING TO DO WITH --

03:07:51.226 --> 03:07:53.328
STUFF LIKE AB TWENTY FORTY THREE

03:07:53.395 --> 03:07:54.162
THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE

03:07:54.229 --> 03:07:55.230
SYSTEM THAT DR ARAMBULA

03:07:55.297 --> 03:07:56.498
MENTIONED WHICH UNFORTUNATELY

03:07:56.565 --> 03:07:58.634
WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR ON

03:07:58.700 --> 03:08:01.603
THE IDEA IS WE NEED TO BE ABLE

03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:03.305
TO HELP PRESERVE PLACEMENTS.

03:08:03.372 --> 03:08:05.507
BY PRESERVING THE FAMILIES AND

03:08:05.574 --> 03:08:06.608
ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE

03:08:06.675 --> 03:08:08.110
TO CALL IF SOMETHING HAPPENS

03:08:08.176 --> 03:08:09.011
SOMETIMES AT THE BRAND NEW

03:08:09.077 --> 03:08:11.179
PLACEMENT AND THE FOSTER PARENTS

03:08:11.246 --> 03:08:12.481
AND THE YOUTH THEY DON'T KNOW

03:08:12.547 --> 03:08:13.215
EACH OTHER.

03:08:13.281 --> 03:08:15.117
THERE MAY BE A TRIGGERING EVENT

03:08:15.183 --> 03:08:16.685
THAT HAPPENS JUST BY A THAT

03:08:16.752 --> 03:08:17.919
THEY'D JUST FROM SOMETHING THAT

03:08:17.986 --> 03:08:19.388
THE FOSTER PARENTS SAYS THAT

03:08:19.454 --> 03:08:20.889
THAT THAT WAS OF RELATED TO THE

03:08:20.956 --> 03:08:22.257
ABUSE AND THESE GUYS ALL IT'S

03:08:22.324 --> 03:08:23.091
ANOTHER PLACE IT'S NOT GONNA

03:08:23.158 --> 03:08:23.959
WORK FOR ME.

03:08:24.026 --> 03:08:25.560
AND THINGS CAN ESCALATE AND GET

03:08:25.627 --> 03:08:26.862
OUT OF CONTROL UNFORTUNATELY THE

03:08:26.928 --> 03:08:28.430
POLICE CAN GET CALLED AND WE

03:08:28.497 --> 03:08:29.231
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CROSS

03:08:29.297 --> 03:08:30.732
OVER TO JUVENILE JUSTICE WE WANT

03:08:30.799 --> 03:08:32.467
TO AVOID THAT WHENEVER POSSIBLE

03:08:32.534 --> 03:08:33.402
WE WANT TO AVOID HAVING THAT

03:08:33.468 --> 03:08:34.569
PLACEMENT IS ROB.

03:08:34.636 --> 03:08:35.570
AND HAVING THAT YOU'VE COME BACK

03:08:35.637 --> 03:08:36.905
GO TO ANOTHER PLACE AND END UP

03:08:36.972 --> 03:08:38.306
WITH THIRTY TWO PLACE THAT NONE

03:08:38.373 --> 03:08:39.174
OF THAT IS GOOD WE WANT TO

03:08:39.241 --> 03:08:40.942
CHANGE THAT AND SO.

03:08:41.009 --> 03:08:42.010
THE IDEA IS --

03:08:42.077 --> 03:08:43.745
OUT AT STAFF HOTLINE FRAME WITH

03:08:43.812 --> 03:08:45.614
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND OUR FOSTER

03:08:45.681 --> 03:08:47.516
YOUTH UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM AND

03:08:47.582 --> 03:08:48.850
CAN HELP DEFUSE THE SITUATION.

03:08:48.917 --> 03:08:50.619
ON AND ROLL OUT A MOBILE

03:08:50.686 --> 03:08:53.955
RESPONSE TEAM IN ANY COUNTY.

03:08:54.022 --> 03:08:55.624
TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF SOMETHING

03:08:55.691 --> 03:08:56.792
IS NEEDED TO GET IN THERE TO

03:08:56.858 --> 03:08:59.094
HAVE SOME THERAPY TO HAVE SOME

03:08:59.161 --> 03:09:01.863
PROVIDE

03:09:01.930 --> 03:09:03.465
NEEDED AND THEN THE FOLLOW UP TO

03:09:03.532 --> 03:09:04.299
MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PLAN

03:09:04.366 --> 03:09:04.700
IN PLACE.

03:09:04.766 --> 03:09:09.304
ONGOING YOU KNOW SORT OF ONE THE

03:09:09.371 --> 03:09:11.640
CRITICAL THING WE SENIOR STATES

03:09:11.707 --> 03:09:15.177
NEW JERSEY SIMILAR STRUCTURE

03:09:15.243 --> 03:09:16.244
THEY ACTUALLY OFFER TO EVERY

03:09:16.311 --> 03:09:18.013
CHILD THE COURSE TO JERSEY IS

03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:19.948
MUCH SMALLER THAN CALIFORNIA SO.

03:09:20.015 --> 03:09:20.782
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT --

03:09:20.849 --> 03:09:22.451
AND THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE HAS A

03:09:22.517 --> 03:09:24.086
SIMILAR KIND OF EFFORT AS WELL

03:09:24.152 --> 03:09:25.620
SO WE THINK THAT IT'S VERY

03:09:25.687 --> 03:09:27.155
PROMISING IN THE MEANTIME --

03:09:27.222 --> 03:09:28.290
A LOT OF COUNTIES ARE USING

03:09:28.356 --> 03:09:29.825
THEIR FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT

03:09:29.891 --> 03:09:30.992
AND RETENTION MONEY WE CAUGHT

03:09:31.059 --> 03:09:32.394
DIPPERS SIZED SORRY FOR THE

03:09:32.461 --> 03:09:32.928
ACRONYM.

03:09:32.994 --> 03:09:35.564
ON THINGS LIKE THE VENTURA UP

03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:37.199
HERE PARTNERS --

03:09:37.265 --> 03:09:38.033
IS FOR IS FUNDED RIGHT NOW

03:09:38.100 --> 03:09:39.568
THROUGH THAT FUNDING WHICH IS

03:09:39.634 --> 03:09:41.203
GOING TO BE ENDING AT THE END OF

03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:42.637
THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR SO YOU

03:09:42.704 --> 03:09:44.039

03:09:48.810 --> 03:09:51.113
LOT TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT CAN

03:09:51.179 --> 03:09:52.180
SUPPORT THE FAMILIES AND THE

03:09:52.247 --> 03:09:53.782
YOUTH IN A FAMILY SETTING AND

03:09:53.849 --> 03:09:55.717

S. T. R. T. P. TYPE OF FACILITY

03:09:57.185 --> 03:09:58.286
OR AVOID IT IF.

03:09:58.353 --> 03:10:00.188
AT ALL TOGETHER WE HAVE TO HAVE

03:10:00.255 --> 03:10:01.523
THE SERVICES IN PLACE THEY HAVE

03:10:01.590 --> 03:10:03.091

WRAPAROUND SERVICE YOU USED TO

TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR

PARENTS BEFORE YOU HELP THEM.

03:12:55.230 --> 03:12:55.697
WE WERE IN ONE OF THE MOST

03:12:55.764 --> 03:12:56.631
FAMILY CENTRIC COUNTRIES IN THE

03:12:56.698 --> 03:12:57.532
WORLD.

03:12:57.599 --> 03:12:58.700
TELLING THEM THAT WE USED TO

03:12:58.767 --> 03:13:00.669
TAKE KIDS AWAY BEFORE WE HELP

03:13:00.735 --> 03:13:02.404
THEIR FAMILIES.

NEEDLESS TO SAY THE TALK DID NOT

03:13:03.805 --> 03:13:05.507
GO WELL.

03:13:05.573 --> 03:13:06.708
BUT SOME THINGS HAVE GONE REALLY

03:13:06.775 --> 03:13:08.576
WELL SINCE THEN.

03:13:08.643 --> 03:13:09.444
SOME THINGS HAVE GONE REALLY

03:13:09.511 --> 03:13:11.813
WELL WE HAD VIRTUALLY ZERO SLOTS

03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:13.114
WE AT SOME EXPERIMENTATION

03:13:13.181 --> 03:13:14.516
AROUND THE STATE.

03:13:14.582 --> 03:13:16.351
AND NOW BY BEST ESTIMATES THERE

03:13:16.418 --> 03:13:17.552
ARE AT LEAST EIGHT THOUSAND

03:13:17.619 --> 03:13:18.853
FLIGHTS A PROPER AND THE STATE

03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:19.955
OF CALIFORNIA.

03:13:20.021 --> 03:13:21.456
AND WE'RE ABLE TO HELP KIDS IN

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:22.590
WAYS THAT WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE

03:13:22.657 --> 03:13:23.858
TO HELP THEM BEFORE WE'RE ABLE

03:13:23.925 --> 03:13:25.226
TO HELP THEM ACROSS SYSTEMS

03:13:25.293 --> 03:13:27.228
SOMETIMES IN WAYS THAT WE'VE

03:13:27.295 --> 03:13:27.796
NEVER BEEN ABLE TO HELP THE

03:13:27.862 --> 03:13:28.797
BEFORE.

03:13:28.863 --> 03:13:29.898

03:13:29.965 --> 03:13:32.267
GONNA GET GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS AND

03:13:32.334 --> 03:13:33.568
GOODNESS.

03:13:33.635 --> 03:13:35.403
SO LET'S SAY WE HAVE TEN

03:13:35.470 --> 03:13:36.171
THOUSAND VOTES BECAUSE NOBODY

03:13:36.237 --> 03:13:37.739
QUITE KNOWS HOW MANY SLOTS

03:13:37.806 --> 03:13:39.541
WRAPAROUND WE HAVE.

03:13:39.607 --> 03:13:41.376
WE STILL HAVE SIXTY TWO THOUSAND

03:13:41.443 --> 03:13:42.944
KIDS IN OUT OF HOME CARE IN

03:13:43.011 --> 03:13:45.013
CALIFORNIA.

03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:47.649
SO WITH EASIER TO GET REMOVED

03:13:47.716 --> 03:13:50.151
FROM YOUR HOME IN THE STATE.

03:13:50.218 --> 03:13:51.353
THAT IS TO GET INTENSIVE

03:13:51.419 --> 03:13:53.688
WRAPAROUND SERVICES.

03:13:53.755 --> 03:13:54.456
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT PICTURE

03:13:54.522 --> 03:13:56.124
FOLKS.

03:13:56.191 --> 03:13:58.326
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING WRONG

03:13:58.393 --> 03:14:00.095
WE'RE DOING A LOT BETTER.

03:14:00.161 --> 03:14:01.796
MOST OF THOSE SLOTS ARE USED

03:14:01.863 --> 03:14:04.032
EITHER FOR STEP DOWN --

03:14:04.099 --> 03:14:05.467
AT FROM OUT OF HOME CARE.

03:14:05.533 --> 03:14:07.702
OR AS A AS A PREVENTION

03:14:07.769 --> 03:14:09.471
INTERVENTION AFTER REPORT IS

03:14:09.537 --> 03:14:11.206
MADE THE CPS.

03:14:11.272 --> 03:14:12.941
BUT I HAVE ON THIS PANEL KIND OF

03:14:13.008 --> 03:14:15.610
ALL THE PEOPLE I NEED BECAUSE OF

03:14:15.677 --> 03:14:16.644
TEACHER.

03:14:16.711 --> 03:14:18.813
EMERGENCY ROOM DOC AND A PERSON

03:14:18.880 --> 03:14:20.215
WHO HAD SOMEONE IN THEIR HOME

03:14:20.281 --> 03:14:22.250
THAT DIDN'T GET TO THE SUPPORT

03:14:22.317 --> 03:14:23.985
THEY NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

03:16:18.466 --> 03:16:21.069
IF EVERY TEACHER HAD ACCESS TO

03:16:21.136 --> 03:16:21.803

WE HAVE FEWER REPORTS TO CVS.

03:16:31.513 --> 03:16:33.014
BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT NECESSARY

03:16:33.081 --> 03:16:34.782
WHEN YOU CAN HELP A FAMILY

03:16:34.849 --> 03:16:36.551
RATHER THAN MAKE A CPS REPORT

03:16:36.618 --> 03:16:37.986
AND YOU CAN DO IT SEAMLESSLY AND

03:16:38.052 --> 03:16:39.621

BECAUSE IF THERE'S A DELAY YOU

03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:43.958
HAVE TO MAKE THE CBS REPORT

03:16:44.025 --> 03:16:45.693
RIGHT IF YOU CAN'T GET SOMEBODY

03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:47.262

03:16:53.735 --> 03:16:55.036
IMPORTANT LEGISLATION.

03:16:55.103 --> 03:16:57.138
IF YOU CAN'T CALM OF A RESPONSE

03:16:57.205 --> 03:17:00.642
THEN YOU'RE FORCED TO CALL CPS

03:17:00.708 --> 03:17:03.678
FOR ENERGY --

03:17:03.745 --> 03:17:04.479
THERE ARE NO BAD PEOPLE OUT

03:17:04.546 --> 03:17:06.814
THERE WANTING TO DO BAD THINGS.

03:17:06.881 --> 03:17:07.782
THERE'S NO BAD MENTAL HEALTH

03:17:07.849 --> 03:17:09.884
DIRECTORS ARE SAYING I DON'T

03:17:09.951 --> 03:17:11.452
WANT TO SAVE KIDS.

03:17:11.519 --> 03:17:12.921
BUT THERE'S A HUGE FEAR OF RISK

03:17:12.987 --> 03:17:14.322
IN OUR SYSTEMS.

03:17:14.389 --> 03:17:15.790
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GUYS CAN

03:17:15.857 --> 03:17:17.458
COME IN.

03:17:17.525 --> 03:17:19.127
THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WHERE I

03:17:19.194 --> 03:17:20.795
THINK WE CAN BE HELPFUL IN A

03:17:20.862 --> 03:17:22.931
DIFFERENT WAY --

03:17:22.997 --> 03:17:24.065
BECAUSE WE CAN CREATE A

03:17:24.132 --> 03:17:25.767
DIFFERENT SYSTEM THAT CAN

03:17:25.833 --> 03:17:28.670
RESPOND IN MORE PROACTIVE WAY.

03:17:28.736 --> 03:17:30.305
AND WE CAN'T DO THAT WITH THE

03:17:30.371 --> 03:17:32.574
SINGLE SYSTEM RESPONSE IT CAN'T

03:17:32.640 --> 03:17:33.007
BE CHILD WELFARE IS

03:17:33.074 --> 03:17:33.975
RESPONSIBILITY.

03:17:34.042 --> 03:17:35.476
IT CAN'T BE EDUCATIONS

03:17:35.543 --> 03:17:37.545
RESPONSIBILITY AND IT CAN BE

03:17:37.612 --> 03:17:38.846
MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSIBILITY.

03:17:38.913 --> 03:17:40.048
WE GIVE YOU ONE MORE PIECE OF

03:17:40.114 --> 03:17:41.749
GOOD NEWS WE WORK BUT WE DO A

03:17:41.816 --> 03:17:43.484
LOT OF WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO AND

03:17:43.551 --> 03:17:45.620
ALAMEDA COUNTIES.

03:17:45.687 --> 03:17:47.155
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY KIDS

03:17:47.222 --> 03:17:48.856
ARE IN THE JUVENILE HALL IN

03:17:48.923 --> 03:17:50.725
ALAMEDA COUNTY RIGHT NOW.

03:17:50.792 --> 03:17:54.262
I KNOW IT'S FIFTY EIGHT FIFTY

03:17:54.329 --> 03:17:55.563
EIGHT WE BUILT A BIG HALL.

03:17:55.630 --> 03:17:57.665
AND IT'S MOSTLY EMPTY I WANNA

03:17:57.732 --> 03:17:59.133
DANCE THROUGH THOSE EMPTY.

03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:00.935
BROOMS AND THAT HALL SOMETIMES

03:18:01.002 --> 03:18:02.503
BECAUSE I'M IT'S SUCH A HUGE

03:18:02.570 --> 03:18:03.838
DIFFERENCE FROM WHERE IT WAS

03:18:03.905 --> 03:18:05.039
WHEN I STARTED WHEN WE USED TO

03:18:05.106 --> 03:18:06.341
HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY KIDS.

03:18:06.407 --> 03:18:07.809
IN THE JUVENILE HALL AND THEY

03:18:07.875 --> 03:18:09.077
WOULD STAY THERE FOR VERY LONG

03:18:09.143 --> 03:18:11.012
PERIODS OF TIME WE'VE DONE THAT

03:18:11.079 --> 03:18:12.480
BECAUSE WE HAVE M. S. T. WE HAVE

03:18:12.547 --> 03:18:14.082
A MENTAL HEALTH COURT ALAMEDA

03:18:14.148 --> 03:18:16.517
COUNTY WE HAVE A WHOLE SERIES OF

03:18:16.584 --> 03:18:18.386
INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN OCCUR.

03:18:18.453 --> 03:18:19.520
NOW WE PROBABLY WILL HAVE

03:18:19.587 --> 03:18:21.055
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN.

03:18:21.122 --> 03:18:23.057
AROUND TWELVE HUNDRED KIDS THAT

03:18:23.124 --> 03:18:25.026
WILL COME THROUGH THAT ALL.

03:18:25.093 --> 03:18:26.661
WE DON'T HAVE AN OF SERVICE FOR

03:18:26.728 --> 03:18:28.463
ALL OF THOSE KIDS TO RECEIVE

03:18:28.529 --> 03:18:31.165
ACCESS IN THAT SMOOTH SEAMLESS

03:18:31.232 --> 03:18:32.600
WAY THAT I'M DESCRIBING

03:18:32.667 --> 03:18:32.900
[inaudible]

03:18:32.967 --> 03:18:33.768
CáC.

03:18:33.835 --> 03:18:36.871
SO IF WE COULD WE ENVISION.

03:18:36.938 --> 03:18:39.974
A SYSTEM THAT SAYS WE CAN

03:18:40.041 --> 03:18:42.143
INTEGRATE THESE SERVICES.

03:18:42.210 --> 03:18:43.211
IN A WAY THAT USES THE

03:18:43.278 --> 03:18:45.113
MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND

03:18:45.179 --> 03:18:46.648
AT AND AND FUNDS --

03:18:46.714 --> 03:18:48.716
AND TAKES AWAY RISK OR FUNDS

03:18:48.783 --> 03:18:51.486
INSTEAD INCENTIVIZE IS RISK FOR

03:18:51.552 --> 03:18:53.421
COUNTIES TO DO THINGS.

03:18:53.488 --> 03:18:54.555
THAT ARE NEW --

03:18:54.622 --> 03:18:57.825
A WHO'S TALKED ABOUT HOW

03:18:57.892 --> 03:19:01.462
WONDERFUL THEIR CHAU WAS --

03:19:01.529 --> 03:19:02.930
AND THERE'S A LOT OF WONDERFUL

03:19:02.997 --> 03:19:04.299
CA AS OUT THERE.

03:19:04.365 --> 03:19:06.434
BUT THIS CHAU HOLD THE MENTAL

03:19:06.501 --> 03:19:06.934
HEALTH DIRECTOR FISCALLY

03:19:07.001 --> 03:19:08.569
ACCOUNTABLE.

03:19:08.636 --> 03:19:09.704
AND THE CHILD WELFARE DIRECTOR

03:19:09.771 --> 03:19:11.372
AND AT THAT'S THEIR JOB THAT'S

03:19:11.439 --> 03:19:13.007
WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

03:19:13.074 --> 03:19:15.009
AND WHAT WE CAN DO WHAT YOU CAN

03:19:15.076 --> 03:19:17.478
DO IS PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO TAKE

03:19:17.545 --> 03:19:19.380
AWAY THE RISK WHERE IF YOU TRY

03:19:19.447 --> 03:19:21.115
TO DO SOMETHING NEW AND YOU

03:19:21.182 --> 03:19:22.216
DON'T GET THE RETURN ON

03:19:22.283 --> 03:19:23.051
INVESTMENT IMMEDIATELY.

03:19:23.117 --> 03:19:25.153
AND YOU WON'T.

03:19:25.219 --> 03:19:26.754
WE KNOW THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT

03:19:26.821 --> 03:19:28.222
IS THAT IMMEDIATE.

03:19:28.289 --> 03:19:29.724
YOU CAN HANG IN THERE AND YOU

03:19:29.791 --> 03:19:32.193
CAN INCENTIVIZE NEW PRACTICES

03:19:32.260 --> 03:19:34.028
LIKE IN CONDITIONAL EDUCATION

03:19:34.095 --> 03:19:36.064
LIKE INTEGRATED SERVICE RESPONSE

03:19:36.130 --> 03:19:38.166
LIKE MOBILE RESPOND --

03:19:38.232 --> 03:19:40.668
JUST JUST FINALLY THE THE WISDOM

03:19:40.735 --> 03:19:42.770
IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO HAVE AN

03:19:42.837 --> 03:19:44.906
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR ONE OF THE

03:19:44.972 --> 03:19:46.541
PROGRAMS WE RUN.

03:19:46.607 --> 03:19:49.277
IS A PROGRAM THAT TAKES KIDS OUT

03:19:49.344 --> 03:19:51.112
OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM WE DO THIS

03:19:51.179 --> 03:19:53.014
FOR VENTURE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY.

03:19:53.081 --> 03:19:55.516
AND AND BRINGS THEM IMMEDIATELY

03:19:55.583 --> 03:19:58.119
INTO A SYSTEM THAT HAS A TWENTY

03:19:58.186 --> 03:19:59.954
THREE OUR ASSESSMENT.

03:20:00.021 --> 03:20:02.223
THEY CAN INTERVENE AND THEN NEXT

03:20:02.290 --> 03:20:06.160
DOOR IN BOTH SITUATIONS IS IN

03:20:06.227 --> 03:20:07.595
ONE CASE A PUFF INTO THE CASE

03:20:07.662 --> 03:20:08.830
THAT STR TP.

03:20:08.896 --> 03:20:10.898
WHERE IF KIDS NEED LONGER TERM

03:20:10.965 --> 03:20:13.601
UP SUPPORT THEY CAN BE HELPED?

03:20:13.668 --> 03:20:18.906
WE HAVE A BETTER THAN 50% OF

03:20:18.973 --> 03:20:19.741
DIVERSION RATE FROM

03:20:19.807 --> 03:20:21.376
HOSPITALIZATION.

03:20:21.442 --> 03:20:22.076
BUT THAT'S NOT THE MOST

03:20:22.143 --> 03:20:23.111
IMPORTANT THING THE MOST

03:20:23.177 --> 03:20:24.545
IMPORTANT THING IS OUR AMBULANCE

03:20:24.612 --> 03:20:28.549
WAIT TIME IS AROUND FOUR MINUTES.

03:20:28.616 --> 03:20:30.184
FOR THAT MEANS ARE AMBULANCES

03:20:30.251 --> 03:20:31.352
GET BACK ON THE STREET THAT

03:20:31.419 --> 03:20:32.854
MEANS THE KIDS ARE IN RESRAINTS

03:20:32.920 --> 03:20:34.155
GET PULLED OUT OF RESTRAINTS

03:20:34.222 --> 03:20:35.323
VERY QUICKLY.

03:20:35.390 --> 03:20:36.891
AND SAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

03:20:36.958 --> 03:20:38.626
PAIN IT ALSO MEANS THAT KIDS

03:20:38.693 --> 03:20:40.194
DON'T SIT IN A WAITING ROOM.

03:20:40.261 --> 03:20:43.664
ABOUT 45% OF THE KIDS THAT COME

03:20:43.731 --> 03:20:45.700
TO US COME TO CHILD WELFARE.

03:20:45.767 --> 03:20:46.868
THE KIDS ARE IN CHILD WELFARE

03:20:46.934 --> 03:20:48.603
THE REALLY CUTE CRISIS.

03:20:48.669 --> 03:20:50.371
THAT KIND OF PRACTICE SHOULD

03:20:50.438 --> 03:20:52.673
SHOULD BE STATEWIDE AND IT AND

03:20:52.740 --> 03:20:54.175
AND THAT KIND OF PRACTICE WHEN

03:20:54.242 --> 03:20:56.711
YOU PAIR IT WITH MOBILE RESPONSE.

03:20:56.778 --> 03:20:58.346
WHERE MOST OF THE KIDS DON'T

03:20:58.413 --> 03:21:01.115
NEED TO EVEN COME TO THE TWENTY

03:21:01.182 --> 03:21:02.550
THREE HOURS CENTER CAN BE VERY

03:21:02.617 --> 03:21:04.552
POWERFUL AND REDUCING THE NUMBER

03:21:04.619 --> 03:21:05.820
OF KIDS THAT COME IN THE CHILD

03:21:05.887 --> 03:21:06.521
WELFARE?

03:21:06.587 --> 03:21:07.655
SO WE HAVE INCREDIBLE

03:21:07.722 --> 03:21:10.091
OPPORTUNITIES AND I'M HAPPY TO

WERE OF A PENNY WISE BUT POUND

03:21:21.569 --> 03:21:22.904
FOOLISH.

03:21:22.970 --> 03:21:24.639
RIGHT AND WE ALL KNOW THAT AN

03:21:24.705 --> 03:21:26.541
OUNCE OF PREVENTION CAN REALLY.

03:21:26.607 --> 03:21:27.975
IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE WE HAVE

03:21:28.042 --> 03:21:29.477
AN OPPORTUNITY AS A STATE AND

03:21:29.544 --> 03:21:31.579
FRANKLY RESPONSIBILITY TO TALK

03:21:31.646 --> 03:21:33.314
ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU ARE.

03:21:33.381 --> 03:21:35.750
ELICITING HERE BUT WILL

03:21:35.817 --> 03:21:37.585
SOMETIMES IT IS FRUSTRATING TO

03:21:37.652 --> 03:21:39.520
LOOK AT WHAT WASN'T ACCOMPLISH

03:21:39.587 --> 03:21:41.489
THIS YEAR I DO WANT TO AGREE

03:21:41.556 --> 03:21:43.157
WITH YOU THERE IS SOME LIGHT OUT

03:21:43.224 --> 03:21:45.259
THERE AS WELL --

03:21:45.326 --> 03:21:46.661
YOU KNOW I WANTED TO FOCUS A

03:21:46.727 --> 03:21:48.496
LITTLE BIT ON FEB FIRST BECAUSE

03:21:48.563 --> 03:21:51.466
OF WHAT YOU HAD SAID KATHY AND

03:21:51.532 --> 03:21:53.568
JUST WANTED --

03:21:53.634 --> 03:21:54.602
TO WAY IN A LITTLE BIT FOR THE

03:21:54.669 --> 03:21:59.974
REST OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE IS

03:22:00.041 --> 03:22:01.909
THAT WILL HALF WHAT'S THE

03:22:01.976 --> 03:22:03.911
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

03:22:03.978 --> 03:22:06.013
REMOVING OF THAT AND WHAT SHOULD

03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:07.281
WE EXPECT.

03:22:07.348 --> 03:22:09.750
OVER THE NEXT YEAR TO TO WITH

03:22:09.817 --> 03:22:10.318
THE REMOVAL OF THOSE PAPERS

03:22:10.384 --> 03:22:11.419
FUNDS.

03:22:11.486 --> 03:22:12.920
SURE I'M HAPPY THAT TO START

03:22:12.987 --> 03:22:16.557
TACKLING THAT THE SO SO FIRST I

03:22:16.624 --> 03:22:18.860
WANT TO JUST SAY AS THAT SORT OF

03:22:18.926 --> 03:22:20.828
POINT OF COMPARISON.

03:22:20.895 --> 03:22:22.029
THERE WAS A RECENT FEDERAL LAW

03:22:22.096 --> 03:22:23.264
I'M AN ACTOR CALL THE FAMILY

03:22:23.331 --> 03:22:24.532
FIRST ACT AND ONE OF THE THINGS

03:22:24.599 --> 03:22:25.900
THAT THE FAMILY FIRST ACT DOES

03:22:25.967 --> 03:22:27.301
IS MAKE A LOT OF CHANGES.

03:22:27.368 --> 03:22:28.836
TO HOW STATES ARE ALLOWED TO

03:22:28.903 --> 03:22:30.972
DRAW DOWN FEDERAL TITLE FOR EACH

03:22:31.038 --> 03:22:31.472
FUNDING FOR GROUP CARE

03:22:31.539 --> 03:22:33.374
PLACEMENTS AND IT CREATES A

03:22:33.441 --> 03:22:34.709
SYSTEM THAT'S GONNA SOUND VERY

03:22:34.775 --> 03:22:36.077
SIMILAR WHEN YOU START HEARING

03:22:36.143 --> 03:22:37.345
MORE ABOUT IT NOT THE POINT OF

03:22:37.411 --> 03:22:38.679
THIS HEARING.

03:22:38.746 --> 03:22:39.881
ON TO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN

03:22:39.947 --> 03:22:40.948
CCR BUT THERE'S SOME --

03:22:41.015 --> 03:22:43.551
CAM DEVIATIONS FROM THOSE --

03:22:43.618 --> 03:22:44.285
FROM WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

03:22:44.352 --> 03:22:45.253
THAT WE THINK CAN I GET IN OUR

03:22:45.319 --> 03:22:47.722
WAY AND SO IT'S FRUSTRATING AND

03:22:47.788 --> 03:22:49.490
WE WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THAT. ONE

03:22:49.557 --> 03:22:50.992
OF THE THINGS THAT THE FEDERAL

03:22:51.058 --> 03:22:52.960
BILL WANTS TO DO IS TO REDUCE

03:22:53.027 --> 03:22:54.996
PLACEMENT AND CONGREGATE CARE

03:22:55.062 --> 03:22:55.630
JUST LIKE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

03:22:55.696 --> 03:22:58.666
DO WITH THE C. R..

03:22:58.733 --> 03:23:00.034
WE WHAT THE BILL CONTAINS AT THE

03:23:00.101 --> 03:23:01.202
FEDERAL LEVEL AS NINE MILLION

03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:04.305
DOLLARS FOR STATES TO RECRUIT

03:23:04.372 --> 03:23:05.540
FOSTER PARENTS.

03:23:05.606 --> 03:23:08.142
AND AND RELATIVES AND WE'VE

03:23:08.209 --> 03:23:09.977
SPENT I MEAN AT THE TIME THE

03:23:10.044 --> 03:23:10.511
BILL WAS INITIALLY PUTTING

03:23:10.578 --> 03:23:11.979
THROUGH WE'D SPENT ABOUT THIRTY

03:23:12.046 --> 03:23:13.047
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON THAT

03:23:13.114 --> 03:23:14.081
JUST IN CALIFORNIA ALONE.

03:23:14.148 --> 03:23:15.516
AND NOW IT'S WILL ABOUT FIFTY

03:23:15.583 --> 03:23:17.285
MILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE STILL

03:23:17.351 --> 03:23:18.886
WORKING THROUGH IT BECAUSE

03:23:18.953 --> 03:23:20.354
NUMBER ONE WE HAVE MORE NUMBERS

03:23:20.421 --> 03:23:22.023
OBVIOUSLY --

03:23:22.089 --> 03:23:24.959
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A TO GO

03:23:25.026 --> 03:23:27.795
AND I THINK BOTH ON THE LICENSED

03:23:27.862 --> 03:23:29.130
FOSTER PARENTS SIDE AND ON THE

03:23:29.196 --> 03:23:30.298
RELATIVE SIDE.

03:23:30.364 --> 03:23:32.633
YOU HAVE NEEDS OF THOSE CARE

03:23:32.700 --> 03:23:34.435
GIVERS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

03:23:34.502 --> 03:23:36.070
THEM AND A GOOD EXAMPLE I

03:23:36.137 --> 03:23:37.505
NOTICED THAT SORT OF HARKEN BACK

03:23:37.572 --> 03:23:39.140
TO THE INITIAL SPEAKER ON THE

03:23:39.206 --> 03:23:40.374
PANEL -- ONE

03:23:40.441 --> 03:23:41.442
OF THE IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT WE

03:23:41.509 --> 03:23:42.977
MADE THIS YEAR WAS --

03:23:43.044 --> 03:23:45.279
AS PART OF THE BUDGET TO APPROVE

03:23:45.346 --> 03:23:46.480
AND YOU HAD A BILL --

03:23:46.547 --> 03:23:48.349
WAS TO ALLOW PAYMENTS AT THE

03:23:48.416 --> 03:23:49.850
TIME OF PLACEMENT TORE RELATIVE

03:23:49.917 --> 03:23:51.352
CARE GIVERS SO THE HUGE CHANGE

03:23:51.419 --> 03:23:53.254
WE KNOW THAT THE RFA PROCESS IS

03:23:53.321 --> 03:23:54.221
SIGNIFICANT.

03:23:54.288 --> 03:23:55.489
AND OUR RELATIVES ARE BEING

03:23:55.556 --> 03:23:57.024
ASKED TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF

03:23:57.091 --> 03:23:57.992
TRAINING THAT THEY NEVER HAD TO

03:23:58.059 --> 03:23:59.894
GO THROUGH WE'RE GETTING GREAT

03:23:59.961 --> 03:24:01.329
COMMENTS BACK THAT THE TRAINING

03:24:01.395 --> 03:24:02.797
IS SO HELPFUL WHY DIDN'T I GET

03:24:02.863 --> 03:24:04.365
THIS BEFORE KIND OF THINGS.

03:24:04.432 --> 03:24:05.399
SO WE THINK THAT IT IS THE RIGHT

03:24:05.466 --> 03:24:07.201
THING BUT IT IS TAKING LONGER

03:24:07.268 --> 03:24:08.469
THAN WEWANTED --

03:24:08.536 --> 03:24:09.870
TO WE KNOW THE NUMBERS ARE GOING

03:24:09.937 --> 03:24:11.138
DOWN I DON'T HAVE THEM NOW I

03:24:11.205 --> 03:24:12.640
DIDN'T GET THAT BEFORE THE

03:24:12.707 --> 03:24:13.374
HEARING BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO

03:24:13.441 --> 03:24:14.842
PROVIDE THAT BUT WE ARE DOING

03:24:14.909 --> 03:24:16.210
FASTERNOW THAT WE'VE MADE SOME

03:24:16.277 --> 03:24:17.645
STREAMLINING CHANGES TO THE

03:24:17.712 --> 03:24:18.579
PROCESS.

03:24:18.646 --> 03:24:19.680
BUT IT'S STILL TAKING LONGER

03:24:19.747 --> 03:24:21.649
THAN WE WANT AT ANY DAY ANY TIME

03:24:21.716 --> 03:24:24.485
MORE THAN LIKE A DAY WAS NOT.

03:24:24.552 --> 03:24:25.586
READY FOR THE RELATIVE CARE

03:24:25.653 --> 03:24:27.121
GIVERS FROM WHAT WE GET FROM A

03:24:27.188 --> 03:24:28.689
LICENSE PLATE PARENT THOSE FOLKS

03:24:28.756 --> 03:24:30.291
THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT TAPES ON

03:24:30.358 --> 03:24:31.926
ADD MAYBE ONE OTHER FRIEND SAID

03:24:31.993 --> 03:24:33.461
ADOPTED OR HAD BEEN A FOSTER

03:24:33.527 --> 03:24:34.762
PARENT I CAN DO THAT.

03:24:34.829 --> 03:24:35.863
TOO AND SO THEY CAME IN AND IN

03:24:35.930 --> 03:24:37.431
ADVANCE THEY WENT THROUGH ALL OF

03:24:37.498 --> 03:24:38.265
THAT PROCESS SO THEY'RE READY TO

03:24:38.332 --> 03:24:42.803
GO AND SO HAVING --

03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:43.371
A GREATER UNDERSTANDING LIKE

03:24:43.437 --> 03:24:46.173
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FAMILIES AND

03:24:46.240 --> 03:24:47.241
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

03:24:47.308 --> 03:24:47.842
YOU CAN DO WITH THE FUNDS FOR

03:24:47.908 --> 03:24:50.077

SAY THAT THEY HAVE --

03:24:54.649 --> 03:24:55.449
NOT REALLY HAD EXPERIENCE WITH

03:24:55.516 --> 03:24:56.984

03:25:09.263 --> 03:25:09.797
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD

03:25:09.864 --> 03:25:11.465
DO WITH THOSE FUNDS ON BOTH

03:25:11.532 --> 03:25:12.867
RELATIVES A NON RELATIVE CARE

03:25:12.933 --> 03:25:15.436

03:25:15.503 --> 03:25:16.971
ESSENTIALLY ENABLE THEM TO HIRE

03:25:17.038 --> 03:25:18.506
A BABYSITTER MAYBE TAKE A

VACATION HAVE SOMEONE THAT WE

03:25:20.474 --> 03:25:21.575
ALL FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

03:25:21.642 --> 03:25:23.577

BASICALLY ON A LOT OF TIMES --

03:25:27.715 --> 03:25:28.849
WE CAN ALSO PAY FOR THE KID ON

TO SUPPORTING THOSE RELATIVES

03:25:41.362 --> 03:25:43.264
NOW FROM DAY ONE A WHICH IS KIND

03:25:43.330 --> 03:25:44.999
OF OUTSIDE OF FLIPPERS --

03:25:45.066 --> 03:25:47.068
WE ALSO CAN SUPPORT THE NEEDS

03:25:47.134 --> 03:25:48.636
THAT THEY HAVE THAT MAY NOT BE

03:25:48.703 --> 03:25:50.071
THE SAME AS A FOSTER PARENT

03:25:50.137 --> 03:25:51.272
WHO'S BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS --

03:25:51.338 --> 03:25:52.873
IT COULD BE --

03:25:52.940 --> 03:25:53.641
YOU KNOW WHAT I DIDN'T REALLY

03:25:53.708 --> 03:25:55.710
HAVE A BEDROOM SET UP FOR THAT

03:25:55.776 --> 03:25:56.844
KID I'D CONVERTED THAT INTO AN

03:25:56.911 --> 03:25:58.713
OFFICE I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING

03:25:58.779 --> 03:25:59.880
TO BE TAKING AND MY NIECE OR

03:25:59.947 --> 03:26:00.281
NEPHEW.

03:26:00.347 --> 03:26:03.184
AND SO THERE CAN BE JUST SORT OF

03:26:03.250 --> 03:26:06.187
TANGIBLE SUPPORT SITE SO YOU

03:26:06.253 --> 03:26:08.289
ONLY FINDING ACTIVITIES WE WANT

03:26:08.355 --> 03:26:09.256
TO DO THE BEST JOB WE CAN'T

03:26:09.323 --> 03:26:10.958
IDENTIFY AS MANY RELATIVES FOR

03:26:11.025 --> 03:26:12.226
THESE CHILDREN WHEN THEY FIRST

03:26:12.293 --> 03:26:13.160
COME INTO CARE.

03:26:13.227 --> 03:26:13.961
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT COUNTIES

03:26:14.028 --> 03:26:15.663
HAVE USE THOSE FUNDS FOR AND

03:26:15.730 --> 03:26:17.264
THEN GENERALLY RECRUITMENT

03:26:17.331 --> 03:26:18.299
TRYING TO GET MORE FOSTER

03:26:18.365 --> 03:26:20.668
PARENTS TO STEP UP AND COME IN

03:26:20.735 --> 03:26:23.204
AND BECOME PARENTS BECAUSE WE WE

03:26:23.270 --> 03:26:24.739
DO HAVE A SHORTAGE I THINK.

03:26:24.805 --> 03:26:26.407
SOME OF IT IS VERY SPECIFIC LIKE

03:26:26.474 --> 03:26:28.709
WE SAW IN I THINK LOS ANGELES

03:26:28.776 --> 03:26:29.643
WHEN WE HAD SUCH A HIGHER TAKE

03:26:29.710 --> 03:26:31.579
OPERATE ON ON THE A. B. TWELVE

03:26:31.645 --> 03:26:32.980
THE EXTENDED FOSTER CARE.

03:26:33.047 --> 03:26:34.682
ON THOSE YOU STAYED IN THEIR

03:26:34.749 --> 03:26:36.217
FOSTER PLACEMENT AND THAT WAS

03:26:36.283 --> 03:26:37.318
AMAZING I MEAN THAT WAS GREAT

03:26:37.384 --> 03:26:38.786
THEY HAD THIS LONG TERM

03:26:38.853 --> 03:26:40.054
RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE PARENTS

03:26:40.121 --> 03:26:41.188
THEY WANTED TO STAY THERE.

03:26:41.255 --> 03:26:42.623
AND SO THAT WAS EXCELLENT BUT

03:26:42.690 --> 03:26:44.258
WHAT THAT MEANT WAS WHEREAS

03:26:44.325 --> 03:26:46.160
BEFORE AB TWELVE AT EIGHTEEN

03:26:46.227 --> 03:26:46.961
THAT YOUTH WOULD HAVE BEEN

03:26:47.027 --> 03:26:48.229
CAUGHT AND WE WOULD HAVE HAD

03:26:48.295 --> 03:26:49.497
THAT HOME TO PLACE WITH WE DON'T

03:26:49.563 --> 03:26:50.965
HAVE THEM ANYMORE SO NOW WE NEED

03:26:51.031 --> 03:26:51.732
TO REPLACE THEM.

03:26:51.799 --> 03:26:53.000
SO WE'RE SORT OF WORKING THROUGH

03:26:53.067 --> 03:26:54.635
A LOT OF THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES

03:26:54.702 --> 03:26:55.569
SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE

03:26:55.636 --> 03:26:57.171
CAN USE THOSE FUNDS.

03:26:57.238 --> 03:26:59.073
FOR THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO SHIFT

03:26:59.140 --> 03:27:00.941
FUNDS OR SHIP SERVICES FROM

03:27:01.008 --> 03:27:03.377
OTHER AREAS TO BUILD TO MAKE UP

03:27:03.444 --> 03:27:05.012
FOR BECAUSE THE WORK THAT WE

03:27:05.079 --> 03:27:06.480
NEED TO DO IN HIS AREA IS NOT

03:27:06.547 --> 03:27:08.048
YET COMPLETE WE DON'T HAVE A

03:27:08.115 --> 03:27:09.583
PLACE THAT'S WELL SUPPORTED.

03:27:09.650 --> 03:27:11.585
THAT WE CAN COUNT ON TO RETAIN

03:27:11.652 --> 03:27:12.520
AND TO BE THERE FOR ALL OF OUR

03:27:12.586 --> 03:27:14.688
YOUTH AS WE MOVE THEM OUT OF

03:27:14.755 --> 03:27:16.757
THESE HOMES THAT ARE GOING AWAY

03:27:16.824 --> 03:27:17.925
OR AS THEY REMAIN IN THE HOMES

03:27:17.992 --> 03:27:19.627
PASS EIGHTEEN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

03:27:19.693 --> 03:27:21.195
OF THAT WE NEED TO REPLACE THOSE

03:27:21.262 --> 03:27:22.897
SO THOSE ARE SOME.

03:27:22.963 --> 03:27:24.832
EXAMPLES THAT I HOPE FOR HELPFUL

03:27:24.899 --> 03:27:25.666
ONE LAST THING I JUST WANTED TO

03:27:25.733 --> 03:27:26.567
SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN

03:27:26.634 --> 03:27:27.268
OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH

03:27:27.334 --> 03:27:28.702
TRANSITION OUT OF CONGREGATE

03:27:28.769 --> 03:27:30.504
CARE INTO A HOME SETTING WE ALSO

03:27:30.571 --> 03:27:31.605
SEE.

03:27:31.672 --> 03:27:33.641
A RETURN TO OLD BEHAVIORS AND SO

03:27:33.707 --> 03:27:35.109
THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRANSITION

03:27:35.176 --> 03:27:36.811
PLANNING WELL ONE OF THE THINGS

03:27:36.877 --> 03:27:38.412
THAT'S WORKED INCREDIBLY WELL IN

03:27:38.479 --> 03:27:39.780
LA COUNTY THROUGH THE OFFICE OF

03:27:39.847 --> 03:27:40.881
CHILD PROTECTION.

03:27:40.948 --> 03:27:42.917
IS KIND OF MORE FRONT END

03:27:42.983 --> 03:27:43.884
THROUGH THE XCELERATED PLACEMENT

03:27:43.951 --> 03:27:45.953
TEAM AT DCFS A LOT OF FUN AND

03:27:46.020 --> 03:27:46.821
WORK WITH THE FOSTER PARENTS

03:27:46.887 --> 03:27:48.756
LIKE HAVING A SIT DOWN WITH ALL

03:27:48.823 --> 03:27:50.825
THE PROVIDERS BEFORE --

03:27:50.891 --> 03:27:52.493
THE CHILD OR YOUTH EVEN GOES

03:27:52.560 --> 03:27:53.561
INTO THE HOME AND THEN

03:27:53.627 --> 03:27:55.062
CONTINUING THE MOBILE RESPONSE

03:27:55.129 --> 03:27:59.934
THROUGHOUT THAT BUT TO TO

03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:00.534
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS GOING

03:28:00.601 --> 03:28:02.036
TO BE A WITH THE FOSTER

03:28:02.102 --> 03:28:02.336
[inaudible]

03:28:02.403 --> 03:28:05.005
AND SO SPRINT'S KNOWS WE'RE NOT

03:28:05.072 --> 03:28:08.642
GOING AWAY DAY IN HERE KNOWING

03:28:08.709 --> 03:28:09.710
THAT IT'S GOING TO GET TOUGH

03:28:09.777 --> 03:28:10.878
WITH ALL OF THE ATTACHMENT

03:28:10.945 --> 03:28:12.313
ISSUES AN INSTITUTIONALIZATION

03:28:12.379 --> 03:28:13.614
THAT HAPPENS --

03:28:13.681 --> 03:28:15.482
AND SO IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THE

03:28:15.549 --> 03:28:16.750
THINGS YOU'RE SAYING BUT THE

03:28:16.817 --> 03:28:18.052
BIGGEST SUCCESS I'VE HAD WITH A

03:28:18.118 --> 03:28:19.854
REALLY HARD TO PLACE YOUTH

03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:21.088
INCLUDING TRANS YOUTH.

03:28:21.155 --> 03:28:22.556
WHO --

03:28:22.623 --> 03:28:24.625
THERE'S A HUGE REJECT REJECTION

03:28:24.692 --> 03:28:26.660
PIECE THERE AND NOT FEELING

03:28:26.727 --> 03:28:28.128
COMFORTABLE AND IT TAKES HOME

03:28:28.195 --> 03:28:30.564
AFTER HOME AFTER HOME AFTER HOME

03:28:30.631 --> 03:28:32.099
TO FIND A PLACEMENT WHERE A LOT

03:28:32.166 --> 03:28:32.967

YOU FEEL SAFE AND SO --

03:28:35.236 --> 03:28:36.604
I JUST THINK MORE WORK ON THE

03:28:36.670 --> 03:28:38.472
FRONT END HAS REALLY MADE A HUGE

03:28:38.539 --> 03:28:42.509
DIFFERENCE TO MAINTAIN STABILITY.

03:28:42.576 --> 03:28:44.478
IF IF I MAY THERE HAS BEEN A LOT

03:28:44.545 --> 03:28:46.247
OF DISCUSSION ABOUT FURS AND

03:28:46.313 --> 03:28:47.481
THANK YOU FOR THAT DAY.

03:28:47.548 --> 03:28:48.816
SOMETIMES WHICH WE WOULD HAVE

03:28:48.883 --> 03:28:49.917
HAD MORE OF THAT BEFORE.

03:28:49.984 --> 03:28:51.886
THE VETO BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER

03:28:51.952 --> 03:28:55.556
YEAR -- YOU

03:28:55.623 --> 03:28:56.991
KNOW IN THE E. R. I WAS HAD TO

03:28:57.057 --> 03:28:58.158
COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR WHEN

03:28:58.225 --> 03:28:59.894
THERE WAS A CRISIS.

03:28:59.960 --> 03:29:01.695
HOW DO WE NOT EXPECT THERE TO BE

03:29:01.762 --> 03:29:02.930
CRISES?

03:29:02.997 --> 03:29:04.565
WITHIN OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM

03:29:04.632 --> 03:29:07.801

COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW DO WE

03:29:12.606 --> 03:29:13.674
HAVE THE RIGHT SOLUTION IS A

03:29:13.741 --> 03:29:16.010
STATE I THOUGHT FIRST WAS ONE OF

03:29:16.076 --> 03:29:17.978
THOSE THAT REALLY ALLOW US.

03:29:18.045 --> 03:29:19.613
TO LISTEN TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND

03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:21.615
RESPOND IN MOMENTS WHEN WE

03:29:21.682 --> 03:29:24.485

03:29:24.551 --> 03:29:25.653
IF I MAY.

03:29:25.719 --> 03:29:28.222
CREATING SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH

03:29:28.289 --> 03:29:30.958
IN THE SYSTEMS --

03:29:31.025 --> 03:29:32.626
IT ONE OF THE THE BEST WAYS TO

03:29:32.693 --> 03:29:36.196
GET BETTER ACCESS TO WRAP AROUND.

03:29:36.263 --> 03:29:38.499

03:29:44.305 --> 03:29:45.439
DEMAND.

03:29:45.506 --> 03:29:47.341

03:29:47.408 --> 03:29:48.475
GET BETTER THAT MUCH FASTER.

03:29:48.542 --> 03:29:50.110
NOBODY'S AFRAID THAT IF THEY

03:29:50.177 --> 03:29:52.146
CLOSE THE CASE THAT THEY'LL HAVE

03:29:52.212 --> 03:29:54.682
