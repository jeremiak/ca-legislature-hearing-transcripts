MR RIVAS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THIS MATTER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I AM VERY VERY PROUD. TO STAND FOR ALL OF YOU THIS MORNING AT PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE THIS BILL. IS A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD. IN ADDRESSING OUR FARM WORKER HOUSING SHORTAGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY IN ASSEMBLY -- IN THE SOME OF THIS AND I REPRESENT. FARMWORKERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. AND TOGETHER WITH OUR FAMILY FARMERS. THEY WORK TO BRING THE FRESHEST PRODUCE TO MARKET. AND CERTAINLY DO THEIR PART IN HELPING FEED THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. YET THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE DECENT PLACES FOR THEM TO LIVE. SOME ARE HOMELESS. OTHERS PAY RENT. AND THAT EATS UP THE MAJORITY OF THEIR FAMILIES ENTIRE PAY. AND THERE HOUSING. THEIR LIVING SITUATION. STOP LARA WILL. WE HAVE FARMWORKERS LIVING IN GARAGES [inaudible] INTENSE. IN VANS. AND ABANDONED BUILDINGS. WE HAVE A MULTIPLE FAMILIES LIVING IN THE SAME ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. THERE ARE FARMWORKERS LIVING IN TRAILERS. WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING NO AIR CONDITIONING DURING THE HOT SUMMER MONTHS. THESE AREN'T JUST FARMWORKERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT'S THEIR CHILDREN [inaudible] THEIR FAMILIES. IN RURAL MONTEREY COUNTY.

THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT HERE. IN THE GOLDEN STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA WHICH RANKS AS THE WHICH NOW RANKS AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. FARMWORKERS ENSURE THAT PLACES LIKE GOOGLE [inaudible] APPLE FACEBOOK. CAN ALL HAVE ENDLESS SUPPLIES OF FOOD IN THE CAFETERIA. YET THE SAME FARM FARM WORKERS DO NOT HAVE A SAFE AND DECENT ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS THIS SITUATION. IS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION IN THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT. THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD CREATE AN OPT IN PROGRAM A TOOL. DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BY WHICH DECENT QUALITY FORMER HOUSING GETS BILL. IT DOES NOT ADD ADDITIONAL RED TAPE FOR OUR FARMERS. INSTEAD IT HELPS MAKE IT EASIER FOR FARMERS. AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO BUILD THE DIGNIFIED FAMILY FRIENDLY HOUSING. FOR WORKERS WHO KEEP US FED AND HELP DRIVE OUR STATE ECONOMY. THIS BILL WON'T SOLVE ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS WITH REGARD TO FARM WORKER HOUSING AND OUR FORMER HOUSING SHORTAGE. BECAUSE THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK% TO BE DONE AROUND THIS ISSUE. BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I CAN SPEAK ABOUT THIS ISSUE I CAN SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FORMER HOUSING. AND I COULD SPEAK ABOUT IT FROM FROM FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. YOU SEE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FARMWORKERS ALMADEN VINEYARDS A PIE SI NOUS. RIGHT HERE CALIFORNIA. HE WITH MY GRANDMOTHER AND MY MOM WAS A SINGLE PARENT THEY RAISED MY BROTHER AND I AND I GREW UP IN FORMER HOUSING WITH TEN MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY. IN OUR HOUSING WAS VERY VERY BASIC BUT IT WAS DECENT. AND OUR ROLE OF FARM WORKER HOUSING. WAS LOCATED RIGHT BESIDE THE VINEYARDS WHEN MY GRANDFATHER WENT IN WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY DECENT HOUSING. OUR DECENT FARM WORKER HOUSING. IT GAVE OUR FAMILY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER LIFE. BUT MANY FARMWORKERS THEN AND TODAY ARE NOT SO LUCKY. THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO WORK THE FEELS LIKE MY GRANDFATHER DID.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IS OUTDATED AN OVERLY COMPLEX WITH TOO MANY BARRIERS TO ACCESS. STATE AID DOES NOT ADEQUATELY SERVE TODAY'S COLLEGE STUDENTS AND DOES NOT REFLECT THE HIGH COST OF LIVING. OF CALIFORNIA. STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. COME TO MY OFFICE ON AN ALMOST WEEKLY BASIS SHARING THEIR STORIES OF HOUSING AND FOOD IN SECURITY. STUDENTS DO OFTEN DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL WILL COME FROM. SOMETIMES THEY DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE THEY WILL SLEEP FOR THE NIGHT. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- ORANGE COUNTY ALLUDED TO EARLIER. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT IT IS TRUE FOR ALL OF THE THREE SEGMENTS OF OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE CSU AND UC FACE THESE CHALLENGES. AND THESE ARE CHALLENGES THAT THOSE STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE TO FACE. COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID REFORM IS NEEDED TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE EQUITABLE AND ENSURE THAT MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE DEGREE. AB THIRTEEN FOURTEEN EXPANDS THE EXISTING CAL GRANT SYSTEM TO HELP COVER NON TUITION COSTS FOR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. IT REMOVES BARRIERS TO ACCESS SUCH AS AGE RESTRICTIONS TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND DOCUMENTATION STATUS. CONSOLIDATING AND SIMPLIFYING THE PROGRAM INTO ONE AWARD.

SURE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE FREE COLLEGE IN OUR GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S AFFORDABLE BUT REALLY WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THAT HOW WE CAN MAKE COLLEGE. DEBT FREE. THE NOT SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT REFORMING OUR CAL GRANT IN MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS TO SIMPLIFY THEM YOU LITERALLY NEED A DEGREE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO APPLY FOR THESE. CALTRAIN A MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS.

IF THEY ARE ENROLLED AN ELIGIBLE TO GO TO A YOU SEE CSU OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THERE ARE OTHER COSTS OF CALLED AS WE KNOW AS WELL NOT JUST TUITION ANYMORE THE AVERAGE DEBT FOR SOMEONE FROM THE CSU AND UC SYSTEM IS NORTH OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THAT LIMITS OUR ABILITY WHEN THEY GRADUATE TO CERTAINLY HERE WITH MILLENNIALS TODAY. TO BUY A HOME START A FAMILY SAVE FOR THEIR RETIREMENT AND SO FORTH SO. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE FOCUS ON THE TRUE COST OF COLLEGE. AND BEFORE US WE HAVE A PLAN WHICH WOULD DO THAT. THE NOT SOMETHING WE CAN DO OVERNIGHT CERTAINLY A MULTI YEAR EFFORT WE ARE STARTING THAT EFFORT IN THE STATE BUDGET.
