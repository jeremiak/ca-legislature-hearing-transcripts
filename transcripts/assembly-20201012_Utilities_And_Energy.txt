WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATED ACCEPTING WRITTEN TESTIMONY AND MAY BE EMAILED TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR BEARING WITH US AS WE IMPLEMENT METHODS TO CONTINUE TO SERVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NOW AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS COMMITTEE THIS TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF ENTITIES THAT ARE WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ENERGY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE NECESSARY STATUTORY FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE RELIABLE CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE ENERGY FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE AND TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR CARRYING OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES THE ROTATING OUTAGES SERVE AS A WARNING SHOT ACROSS THE BOW THE ELECTRIC RELIABILITY MUST NOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED OUR INCREASING RELIANCE ON ELECTRICITY FOR HOMES BUSINESSES CELLPHONES VEHICLES AND TO MEET OUR CRITICAL GREENHOUSE REDUCTION GOALS MEANS THAT WE MUST BE VIGILANT IN SAFEGUARDING THE SECTOR THE GRAVITY OF TURNING OFF THE POWER IN THE MIDST OF A WEST WIDE HEAT STORM GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND WITH FIRES RAGING THROUGHOUT THE STATE MADE THE OUTAGES ALL THE MORE INTOLERABLE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE ALREADY ON EDGE AND UNDER STRESS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC VISIT PHYSICAL HARDSHIPS DURING DURING BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND FIRES THE OUTAGES THAT OCCURRED ON AUGUST THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH BREACHED OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE CPUC THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES HAVE RELIABLE ELECTRIC SERVICES THE PRELIMINARY ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THERE WERE SERIES OF PREVENTABLE MISSTEPS THAT LED TO THE ROTATING ELECTRICITY OUTAGES NEARLY A HALF A MILLION HOMES AND BUSINESSES LOST POWER FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES TO AS LONG AS TWO AND A HALF HOURS ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH THE FOLLOWING DAY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS WERE WITHOUT POWER FROM EIGHT TO NINETY MINUTES THE FACT THAT WE WERE NOT INFORMED UNTIL MINUTES BEFORE THE BLACKOUT STARTED MAKES THE OUTAGES ALL THE MORE EGREGIOUS WHAT'S THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION BECAME APPARENT THE GOVERNOR EXERCISES WITH ALREADY AND MARSHAL THE FORCES OF STATE GOVERNMENT TO SCOUR CALIFORNIA AND THE WESTERN INTERCONNECTION FOR NECESSARY RESOURCES TO PREVENT FURTHER OUTAGES WE OWE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS THE MILITARY PORTS UTILITIES IN THE WESTERN INTERCONNECTION AND IMPORTANTLY THE RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES THAT CONSERVE ENERGY AT CRITICAL TIMES IN SOME CASES PROVIDED CRITICAL NEEDED GENERATION WE NOW MUST HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFICIENCIES THAT CAUSE THE AUDITS IT IS CLEAR FROM THE PRELIMINARY ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS THAT CENTRAL TO THESE OUTAGES WAS A LACK OF PLANNING OR EXECUTION NO ONE GENERATION SOURCE TRIGGER THE OUTAGES MATHIS ALSO BE CAUTIOUS AND NOT JUMPED INTO SOLUTIONS THE COMMITTEE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROCUREMENT IN RESPONSE TO THOSE OUTAGES REMEDIES MUST FOCUS SQUARELY ON THE PROBLEMS AND TARGETED SOLUTIONS LET ME REITERATE GOVERNOR NEWSOM STATEMENT FROM A LETTER WRITTEN TO THE ENERGY ORGANIZATIONS COLLECTIVELY ENERGY REGULATORS FAILED TO ANTICIPATE THIS EVENT AND TO TAKE NECESSARY ACTIONS TO ENSURE RELIABLE POWER TO CALIFORNIANS THE ENERGY PRINCIPLES BEFORE US TODAY HAVE RIGHTFULLY ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HARDSHIP THAT MANY OF THE STATE AND TOURED WHEN THE BROAD SCALE ROTATED OUT AS OCCURRED IN MID AUGUST WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR NOT JUST IDENTIFYING THE SHORTCOMINGS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO PROPERLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY TAKE ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES I'M PUTTING THE ENERGY ORGANIZATIONS ON NOTICE THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS SEEKING REGULAR UPDATES AND PROGRESS REPORTS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIONS ADDRESSING THE DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED IN THE PRELIMINARY ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND THE FINAL REPORT FURTHER WE WILL AT A MINIMUM HOLDEN HEARING PRIOR TO NEXT SUMMER INTO SUMMER READING THIS BEFORE TURNING TO OUR WITNESSES AND TO AVOID CONFUSION IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TODAY'S HEARING IS FOCUSED ON ROTATING OUTAGES THESE ARE OUTAGES THAT ARE CONTROLLED TO ROTATE FROM AREA TO AREA SO NO SINGLE NEIGHBORHOODS ELECTRICITY IS DOWN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME THERE ARE GENERALLY THREE OTHER TYPES OF OUTAGES FIRST LOCAL DISTRIBUTION FAILURES OR OUTAGES THAT MAY OCCUR AT LOCALIZED LEVEL WHEN THERE'S EQUIPMENT FAILURE SECOND PUBLIC SAFETY PUBLIC POWER SHUT OFFS OR WHAT IS NOW COMMONLY KNOWN AS P. S. P. S. S. B. S. OUTAGES ARE DELIBERATE BLACKOUTS ENGINEERED BY AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY OR MUNICIPAL UTILITY TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK AS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND MUNICIPAL UTILITIES HARDEN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE THESE PS PS EVENTS WILL BE SMALLER IN SIZE AND SHORTER IN LENGTH FINALLY CASCADIAN UNCONTROLLED OUTAGES CAN RESULT IN MASSIVE DISRUPTIONS TO ELECTRICITY SERVICE FOR EXAMPLE THE TWO THOUSAND THREE NORTHEASTERN BLACKOUT WAS TRIGGERED BY A SERIES OF FAULTS CAUSED BY TREE BRANCHES TOUCHING POWER LINES IN OHIO HUMAN ERROR SOFTWARE ISSUES AND EQUIPMENT FAILURES LED TO THE MOST WIDESPREAD BLACKOUT IN NORTH AMERICAN HISTORY MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS A NORTHEASTERN US STATES AND PARTS OF CANADA WERE LEFT WITHOUT POWER FOR AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND MANY OF THEM WERE IN THE DARK FOR WEEKS IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT A RELIABLE POWER SYSTEM UNDERPINS OUR ECONOMY AND QUALITY OF LIFE CAREFUL PLANNING TO GUARANTEE ADEQUATE POWER SUPPLIES MODELING OF SYSTEMS UNDER MERIT OF STRESS CONDITIONS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS CALIFORNIA MOVES TOWARD SIXTY PERCENT RENEWABLE ENERGY BY TWENTY THIRTY AND A HUNDRED PERCENT GHG FREE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AS REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW THE ENERGY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SEEMINGLY SEAMLESSLY OPERATE THE GREAT DURING THE AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER HEAT WAVE WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE WITNESSES ABOUT THE ACTIONS THEY UNDERTAKE THEY UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THAT ROTATING OUTAGES DO NOT HAPPEN AGAIN WITH THAT LET ME TURN TO OUR VICE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON FOR A FEW MOMENTS OF OPENING COSTS THANK YOU UP MISTER CHAIR UP I SPENT THE WEEKEND LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE PRELIMINARY ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND I MUST SAY I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED I FIND THAT IT IS -- ESSENTIALLY DEFENSIVE -- THERE'S A LOT OF -- POINTING FINGERS AND SORT OF A -- BLAME -- EXCUSES AND SHORT ON SOLUTIONS WE ARE WE ARE SAYING IN THE SENSE THAT THIS OUTAGE WAS A RESULT OF A THIRTY FIVE YEAR HEAT EVENT WE KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT ACCURATE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE HAD A SIMILAR EVENT WITH SIMILAR HEAT THERE WERE NO BLACKOUTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MIX OF ELECTRONS WERE ON THE GRID AT THAT TIME THIS REPORT ALSO HINTS OR MORE DIRECTLY POINTS AT MARKET FAILURE OF COURSE IT DID OTHER STATES AND REGIONS ARE NOT GOING TO SHIP THEIR ALECTRA WANTS TO CALIFORNIA TO BAIL US OUT THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR PEOPLE THIS REPORT HINTS AT SOME LIMITED GENERATION IN THE FUTURE HECK WE NEED ADDITIONAL GENERATION NOW FOR THE TIMES WHEN CALIFORNIANS NEED IT THE MOST I FIND THE SUGGESTIONS RATHER FLIMSY IT DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ADEQUATE ADDITIONAL A PLAN FOR GENERATION NOW BUT IT IS FULL OF A LOT OF EUPHEMISMS EUPHEMISMS LIKE DEMAND RESPONSE TO ME THAT IS A EUPHEMISM THAT DESCRIBES VOLUNTARY BROWNOUTS THE THROTTLING BACK OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE SUPPLY ANOTHER EUPHEMISM IS TIME OF USE RATES TO YOUR FURNACE A EUPHEMISM FOR PRICING ELECTRONS SO HIGH THE CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD TO USE THEM WHEN THEY NEED THEM THE MOST ARE WE HEAR TALK ABOUT MICRO GRIDS WELL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC HAS A LARGE PRESENCE IN MY DISTRICT THEY JUST RECEIVED A LARGE CONTRACT TO DEVELOP A MICROGRID FOR THE PORT OF LONG BEACH HERE IS THE MIX OF ELECTRONS IN A QUOTE SUSTAINABLE MICROGRID THREE HUNDRED KILOWATTS OF SOLAR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY KILOWATTS OF BATTERY CAPACITY AN FIVE HUNDRED KILOWATTS OF DIESEL LET THAT SINK IN FOR A MOMENT THE NECESSITY OF DIESEL TO MAKE A MICROGRID SYSTEM FUNCTION NOW WE HAVE TO ADD TO THE DEMAND SIDE THE POLITICS OF ELECTRICITY ELECTRIFYING EVERY WHEEL THAT ROLLS HAS BEEN A SLOGAN AROUND HERE WE BANNED THE INTERNET AT THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE WE ELECTRIFY BUILDINGS WITHOUT NATURAL GAS ELECTRIFY HOMES WITHOUT NATURAL GAS AND EVEN THE THOUGHT OF ELECTRIFYING RESTAURANTS WITHOUT NATURAL GAS WE USED TO HAVE A GRID THAT WAS AFFORDABLE RELIABLE AND AVAILABLE WHEN CALIFORNIANS NEEDED IT EVEN IN TIMES OF A HEAT WAVE LIKE TO GRID IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX TODAY WE HAVE AGREED THAT IS INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE UNRELIABLE AND UNAVAILABLE WHEN THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDED THE MOST WE ARE SUGGESTING SOMEHOW THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD FORGO USE OF ELECTRICITY THAT THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX OR NINE OR TEN O'CLOCK THAT IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE COMING HOME FROM WORK WHEN THEY'RE PLANNING THEIR NEXT DAY AND WHEN THE PROMISE OF THE CALIFORNIA GRID HAS BEEN TO THEM ELECTRICITY WILL BE AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE WHEN YOU NEED AND HERE IS THE IRONY OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY CALIFORNIA HAS CREATED TWO CLASSES OF ELECTRONS ONE CLASS IS MORAL AND ANOTHER CLASSES IN MORE WE ARE THROTTLING DOWN OR SHUTTING DOWN OR CLOSING THE KIND OF IMMORAL ELECTRONS THAT THE STATE HAS CATEGORIZED AND THE MORAL ELECTRONS HAVE BEEN LETTING US DOWN AND YET IT HAS BEEN THOSE VERY IMMORAL ELECTRONS THAT HAVE BEEN THE ONES THAT WE HAVE HAD TO REACH TO IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR LIGHTS ON WE SHOULD LEARN THE OBVIOUS LESSONS OF THIS IRONY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISS THANK YOU MR OF VICE CHAIR CLEARLY WE HAVE IMPORTANT GOALS THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF -- MEETING CLIMATE CHANGE THAT ON ASSUME YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS I'M SURE WILL BE COVERED IN SOME TO SOME DEGREE -- FROM OUR OUR WITNESSES WHO ALL INTRODUCED AT THIS POINT AND THEN CERTAINLY MEMBERS ONCE WE HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM OUR WITNESSES THEN WE WILL LOOK TO MEMBERS TO HAVE -- THEY'RE OFTEN ASK QUESTIONS SO IF I COULD -- DR WORK TO DO WE'RE TRYING TO GET MY ATTENTION YES OF THE LIGHT I DO HAVE AN OPENING STATEMENT ALL AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE RELIABILITY I'M SORRY DR BURKE IF I COULD I HAVE I WAS GIVEN A COURTESY TO THE VICE CHAIR AT THIS STAGE I WAS GOING TO TURN TO OUR WITNESSES I WILL TURN TO YOU FIRST ONCE THEY CONCLUDE AND THEN IF THAT'S FAIR WHY HAVEN'T WE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT LONG TERM STORAGE IN PARTICULAR WHY HAVEN'T WE DONE PROP HYDRO WE HAVE NO PLANS FOR THAT'S A WAY TO GET THROUGH THIS WE ALSO NEED LONGER TERM STORAGE FOR SEASONAL STORAGE HYDROGEN IS PROBABLY THE BEST ALTERNATIVE THERE REMAIN THOSE PLANS WE HAVE NO PLANS OF WHO WILL -- WILL CAPTURE THAT FOR THE MOMENT BUT I MAY TURN BACK TO YOU ONCE OR WITNESSES COMPLETE THEIR -- TESTIMONY AND THEN YOU CAN AND THEY MAY TOUCH ON IT IN THEIR PRESENTATION FIRST IT'S WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OTHERS INTRODUCE EVERYONE AND YOU'LL SPEAKER IN THE ORDER -- THAT I'M CALLING OUT UNLESS YOU WORK SOMETHING ELSE OUT -- DAVID HAAS CHARLES THE CHEER OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION C. BURKE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR ELLETT MANSER THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR WE WELCOME YOU -- MISS MANSER WHO'S BEEN THE CEO OF THE HI SO SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS MONTH -- HE WAS PRESENT PRESENT PREVIOUSLY WAS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION BASED IN PORTLAND OREGON -- THE RELIABLE RELIABLE EFFICIENT INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND NEW TECHNOLOGY WAS A CENTRAL FOCUS OF -- DURING FOCUS DURING ELLIOTT'S PLEASURE TO WELCOME YOU BACK TO YOUR NATIVE STATE AND SO WILL TURN TO YOU -- THROUGH THIS PRESENTATION SO WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO STARTING OFF WITH -- PRESIDENT BATCH WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GOOD MORNING CHAIR HOLDEN AND VICE CHAIR PATTERSON AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TODAY TO ADDRESS THE HISTORIC HEAT WAVE AND THE ROTATING OUTAGES EXPERIENCED BY MANY CALIFORNIANS ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH AS WE AFFIRM TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN OUR LETTER DELIVERING OUR INITIAL ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT THE POWER OUTAGES EXPERIENCED BY CALIFORNIANS THAT WEEK WERE UNACCEPTABLE AND UNBEFITTING OF A STATE AND THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AND WE CAN AND WE WILL TAKE ACTIONS TO ENSURE THEY DO NOT OCCUR AGAIN BEFORE WE GET INTO THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT I DO WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO DISCUSS THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS THAT LED TO UP TO THE PERIOD IN QUESTION WHAT WE EXPERIENCED WAS A SEVERE ONE IN THIRTY FIVE YEARS HEAT STORM THAT NOT ONLY IMPACTED CALIFORNIA BUT THE ENTIRE WESTERN UNITED STATES TEMPERATURES WERE TEN TO TWENTY DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL DURING THIS PERIOD CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THE HOTTEST AUGUST DAYS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AUGUST FIFTEENTH WAS INDEED THE HOTTEST AND AUGUST FOURTEENTH WAS THE THIRD HOTTEST DEATH VALLEY NOTABLY REACHED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY DEGREES DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME WE ALSO HAD A SEIZURE OF DRY LIGHTNING STORMS WHICH SPARKED THOUSANDS OF FIRES INCLUDING THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY THIS WASN INDEED AN EXTREME WEATHER EVENT IT IS MADE CLEAR CLIMATE CHANGE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND IT IS HERE NOW FORTUNATELY FOR THE COUNTRY INDEED THE WORLD CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WORKING TO COUNTER ACT CLIMATE CHANGE FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OUR STATE HAS INVESTED IN RESEARCH AND HAS CHARTED THE PATH GROUNDED IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY WE DO HAVE SOLUTIONS WE MUST NOW ACCELERATE THE PACE OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION TO BETTER MATCH THAT OF OUR CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS WE REMAIN ON THE RIGHT PATH AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR FOCUS ON RELIABILITY AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT OUR DIRECTION OUR AGENCIES REMAIN UNWAVERINGLY IN UNWAVERING IN OUR COMMITMENT TO CLEAN ENERGY AND TO OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND NOTHING IN OUR ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS LEADS US TO SECOND GUESS A CLEAN RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ENERGY FUTURE I WOULD LIKE TO NOW GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF EACH OF OUR AGENCIES ROLES IN MAINTAINING RELIABILITY WITHIN THE STATE AND THEN TURN OF MY COLLEAGUES CHAIR HARSH SHIELD MR BURKE AND MR MEN'S -- AND WE K. SO THIS WOULD BE SLIGHT TO THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR CAL AYE SO CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION CPUC AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION C. E. C. H. PLAY AN INTEGRAL AND INTERRELATED ROLE IN MAINTAINING ELECTRIC RELIABILITY IN CALIFORNIA THE CDC CREATES THE FORECASTS IT IS A STATE AGENCY THAT PREPARES AND ADOPTS A LONG TERM ELECTRICITY DEMAND FORECASTS FOR THE STATE AND THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR RELIABILITY PLANNING SPECIFICALLY THESE DEMAND FORECASTS ARE UTILIZED IN THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM AND THESE DEMAND FORECASTS ARE CONDUCTED FOR AVERAGE WEATHER YEARS ALSO KNOWN AS ONE IN TEN PEAK DEMAND FORECAST THE CPUC SETS THE PROCUREMENT IT IS A STATE AGENCY THAT SETS THE RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ELECTRIC INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND THE ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE CAL AYSO MARKET TO ENSURE THERE IS SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO MEET THE FORECASTED DEMAND THESE ENTITIES REPRESENT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE ENERGY DEMAND IN THE STATE AND ABOUT NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THE DEMAND IN THE KALISTO SYSTEM NON CPUC JURISDICTIONAL ENTITIES SET THEIR OWN RESOURCE ADEQUACY RULES OR DEFAULT TO THE CALLOUS TO REQUIREMENTS FOR A BIT MORE INFORMATION ON A RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS THEY ARE SET BASED ON THE PEAK DEMAND IN THE CEC'S DEMAND FORECAST PLUS A PLANNING RESERVE MARGIN OF AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO ACCOUNT FOR UNPLANNED OUTAGES AND HIGHER THAN AVERAGE DEMAND THE CALISTO IS THE GRID OPERATOR IT IS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT COMPANY THAT OPERATES THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AND THE WHOLESALE ENERGY MARKETS TO MAINTAIN THE RELIABILITY OF THE GRID IN REAL TIME THE RESOURCES LOAN SERVICING ENTITIES OWNED OR CONTRACTED WITH TO MEET THEIR RESOURCE ADEQUACY CURRENT REQUIREMENTS ARE SHOWN TO CAL AYE SO EVERY MONTH FROM THERE THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCESS SHIFTS FROM THE PLANNING SPACE TO THE CALLUSES ENERGY MARKET AND GRID OPERATION ALL RESOURCE ATTICUS ALL RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM RESOURCES ARE REQUIRED TO BID INTO THE ENERGY MARKETS UNDER RULES ESTABLISHED BY CAL I SENT THE KALISTO OPERATES ENERGY MARKETS FOR ENTITIES WITH IN ITS SYSTEM AND ACROSS THE WIDER WESTERN FOOTPRINT VIA THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET KALISTO ALSO OPERATES A DAY AHEAD MARKET FOLLOWED BY RESIDUAL UNIT COMMITMENT PROCESS AND A REAL TIME MARKET MOVING NOW TO -- THE ROOT CAUSES AND THAT WOULD BE SLIDE THREE THE PRIMARY REPORT FINDS THAT THERE WERE THREE OVER ARCHING ROOT CAUSES OF THE ROTATING OUTAGES AND STRESSED GRID CONDITIONS DURING THE AUGUST HEAT STORM FIRST THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT HEAD OF THAT WHICH I'VE DISCUSSED OUR CURRENT PROCESSES ARE BASED ON PLANNING FOR THE AVERAGE WEATHER YEARS WITH SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTION TO ACCOUNT FOR A RELATIVELY HIGHER TEMPERATURES BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS TO STAINED EXTREME WESTERN STATE HEAT STORM WE EXPERIENCED THIS WAS INDEED A ONE AND THIRTY FIVE YEAR OF THAT IN PART BECAUSE OF THE SUSTAINED DAY DAYS THAT EXPERIENCED THE THE HIGH TEMPERATURES WE ARE EVOLVING OUR PLANNING SO CALIFORNIA IS PREPARED FOR THESE TYPES OF EVENTS SECOND ARE PLANNING TARGETS HAVE NOT KEPT PACE TO PROCURE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES THAT CAN BE RELIED UPON TO MEET DEMAND IN THE EARLY EVENING HOURS SO THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND WAS EVEN TIGHTER IN THE EARLY EVENING WHEN AIR CONDITIONER DEMAND REMAINED HIGH BUT THE SELLER WAS TAPERING OFF FAST WITH THE TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ENERGY MIX WE HAVE MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PLANNING PROCESS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO FULLY ACCOUNT FOR MAKING ENOUGH RESOURCES AVAILABLE DURING THAT NET EVENING PEAK DURING AN EXTREME AND SUSTAINED HE EVENT PRESENT AT HER IF I COULD I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT I I THINK IF THERE SEEMS TO BE DIFFICULTY IN HEARING YOU FOR SOME WHO ARE NOT US BUT WHO ARE WATCHING AND SO IF MAYBE YOU CAN TRY TO GET A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MICROPHONE AND SEE IF THAT CAN OKAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M SORRY THANK YOU OKAY FINALLY SOME DAY AHEAD MARKET PRACTICES MASS THE FULL LEVEL OF DEMAND LEADING TO A HIGHER AMOUNT OF EXPORTS HI AT CAL AYSO CAN ADDRESS THESE IN MORE DETAIL LATER IN THE PRESENTATION BUT THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS WITH UNDER SCHEDULING IN THE DAY AHEAD MARKET MASKED BY CONVERGENT BIDDING MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO NOW TURN TO -- CHAIR HAWK SHIELD FOR AND THE NEXT -- POINT THANK YOU FOR THE BETTER AND AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN HOLDEN VICE CHAIR PATTERSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- LET ME FIRST JUST REITERATE WHAT HAPPENED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME PERSONALLY TO ALL OF US OF THE ENERGY AGENCIES TO THE GOVERNOR YOU KNOW TO YOU AND TO THE PUBLIC WE OWN THAT AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DEDICATED TO GETTING IT RIGHT AND I THINK THE BIG PICTURE MESSAGE HERE IS THAT THIS IS A SOLVABLE PROBLEM BUT LET ME SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW TO VICE CHAIR OF PATTERSON'S POINT THE STORM WE JUST HAD A DIFFERENT VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THAT HAPPENED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS CHART THIS IS THE TEMPERATURE CURVES FOR THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE TEMPERATURES WERE HIGHER BUT THAT THEY THEY WERE EXTENDED OVER A FIVE DAY PERIOD AND THAT'S NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE ENTIRE WEST WHICH IS PART OF THE REASON WHY IMPORTS WERE CUT IN HALF I WOULD JUST REMIND EVERYBODY THE HIGHEST RELIABLY RECORDED TEMPERATURE IN WORLD HISTORY HAPPENED IN AUGUST DURING THIS HEAT STORM IN DEATH VALLEY HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES AND SO THIS IS THE NEW WORLD THAT WORK IN AND WE HAVE TO CALIBRATE TO IT BUT JUST TO TO LEVEL SET -- WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE DYNAMICS WHERE LET ME GO BACK TO PRESENT BOETTCHER CORRECT NO I DON'T WILL GO ON THE NEXT SLIDE WHICH IS SLIDE -- FIVE WE'LL TURN NOW TO MISTER BURRAGE MISTER CHAIR -- I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS BEFORE I GET INTO -- THE PRESENTATION IF I MIGHT PATTERSON -- WE JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE YOU PRESENT TODAY -- AS NOTED MY NAME IS OKAY YES IF YOU COULD ADJUST THE MICROPHONE SO THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING DIRECTLY INTO THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL PLEASE CONTINUE GOT IT THANK YOU SO WELL FIRST ALSO LET ME KNOW THAT -- I HAD AND NOW IT'S MY RETIREMENT IN FEBRUARY SO -- MY RETIREMENT IN THIS EVENT ARE UNRELATED -- MY SUCCESSOR IS TO MY RIGHT -- AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN HIM TO LEAD THE WAY FOR AS NOTED THE CALIFORNIA ISO IS A NOT FOR PROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION CHARGED WITH MANAGING THE FLOW OF ELECTRONS AGAINST THE HIGH VOLTAGE POWER LINES OF MAKE UP EIGHTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S AND A SMALL PART IN THE VADAS GRID WALL THE UTILITY STILL OWN THE TRANSMISSION ASSETS THE ISO OPTIMIZES SYSTEM THE OUTAGES THAT OCCURRED IN AUGUST AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHALLENGES PREVENT ADDITIONAL LOAD SHEDDING ORDERS TOOK PLACE UNDER EXTREME HEAT CONDITIONS FELT ACROSS THE WEST INCREASING DEMAND WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO HEAT PATTERNS OR CLOSER TO ONE THIRTY FIVE YOUR WEATHER CURRENTS THIS PLACE A STRAIN ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION LARGELY DUE TO INCREASED AIR CONDITIONING USE ACROSS THE STATE GET THE QUESTION IS NOT HOW UNUSUAL WHERE THESE EVENTS IN THE PAST TEN YEARS BUT HOW UNUSUAL THEY WILL LOOK TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE EXACT WAYS CLIMATE CHANGE WILL IMPACT OUR ENERGY NEEDS WE AT LEAST HAVE SOLID INDICATORS SUGGESTING THE PATH FORWARD AND THESE INDICATORS DEMONSTRATE A FEW LESSONS RENEWABLES WERE NOT THE PROBLEM OUR GOALS OF REDUCING GHG CAN BE MET BUT REQUIRES PLANNING AROUND CHALLENGES AND RESPECTING THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE MORE VOLATILE VOLATILE THAN OTHERS DOESN'T MAKE THEM BAD IT JUST MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO PLAN AROUND THOSE FACTORS WE NEED ENERGY RESOURCES WITH FLEXIBLE CHARACTERISTICS TO ADDRESS THE NET DEMAND PEAK WHICH OCCURS LATER IN THE DAY AND I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT WE NEED EXPANDED PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION WITH OTHER STATES WHERE POSSIBLE AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED BUT UNTIL THEN WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TO COMPETE WITH THEM FOR RESOURCES I BELIEVE THE CHALLENGES THESE PAST FEW MONTHS ARE OF NORMAL BUT NOT A FLUKE THE LESSONS LEARNED AND DISCUSS TODAY CAN LEAD TO A DECARBONISE GRID THAT MAINTAINS RELIABILITY CALIFORNIANS HAVE COME TO EXPECT IN THE PAST TWO DECADES THE ISO IS COMMITTED TO ENHANCING OUR MARKET PRACTICES WE'VE NOTED MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS TO ENSURE THEY ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ACTUAL BALANCE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND DURING STRESSED OPERATING CONDITIONS I WANT TO THANK THE AFTER THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY I ALSO WANNA NOTE THAT WITH ME IS MARKED ROTH LEADER UP IN THE GALLERY HIS V. P. OF MARK POLICY PERFORMANCE HE'LL BE ABLE ANSWER MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS IF I CAN THEN GO TO THE SLIDE THE SLIDE FOR YOU WHICH IS ON PAGE FIVE IT SHOWS THE CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED -- ON THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH AND THE LITTLE TWO LINES THE BLUE LINE RECORD REPRESENTS ACTUAL DEMAND THE YELLOW OR ORANGE LINE REPRESENTS WHAT WE CALLED NET DEMAND THAT IS DEMAND ON THE SYSTEM AFTER YOU EXTRACT WIND AND SOLAR PRODUCTION FROM THE SYSTEM AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT GIVES US A VERY GOOD POINT OF HOW MUCH HAS TO BE SUPPORTED BY NON RENEWABLE RESOURCES OR A PARTICULAR NON SOLAR RESOURCES IN THE EVENING HOURS WE HAD STATES THREE EMERGENCIES WHICH MANDATES ON BOTH OF THOSE DAYS WHICH MEANT THAT ARE OPERATING RESERVES WERE LESS THAN NECESSARY TO MEET SYSTEM RELIABILITY NEEDS THE GRAY LINES INDICATE THE TIME AT WHICH WE WERE IN STAGE THREE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS I WAS ON THE CONTROL ROOM FLOOR ON THE FOURTEENTH AND ON THE FIFTEENTH AND HAVE FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT OCCURRED ON THOSE DAYS BOTH OF THE THE LOAD SHED EVENTS OCCURRED DURING NET PEAK EVENING HOURS NOT DURING THE PEAK OF THE DAY THIS IS A POINT THAT I THINK ISN'T VERY IMPORTANT FOR US THAT ARE SITTING BACK HERE TO GRAPPLE WITH AS WE PLAN FOR THE EVENING HOURS AFTER THE SOLAR HAS SET AN THE DISTRIBUTED ROOFTOP -- RESOURCES ARE GONE IS OUR CHALLENGE IF I CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE NOTED -- AS WE DID AN ANALYSIS AND AND NOTED IN THE REPORT THAT UNDER SCHEDULING IN THE DAY AHEAD MARKET SIGNIFICANTLY EXACERBATED THIS ISSUE WE FOUND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT SLIDE YOU CAN SEE THE GRAY LINE IS THE LOW THAT WAS SCHEDULED WHEREAS THE ORANGE LINE WAS THE ACTUAL DEMAND INTO THE SITUATION WHY THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ARE UNDER SCHEDULING IN THE MARKET AND TAKES STEPS COLLECTIVELY ACROSS OUR THREE ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM THIS CONTRIBUTED TO AN EX TO EXPORTS COME OUT OF OUR MARKET BECAUSE THE MARKET INDICATED THAT THE LOAD THAT CLEARED IS A GRAY LINE AND THE DIFFERENCE IS I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT EXPORTS IN MORE -- ELABORATE TERMS AS WE MOVE ON BUT I WANT TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT EXPORTS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ABOUT THAT WATER WE EXPORTING WELL FIRST OF ALL CALIFORNIA IS A NET IMPORTS STATE IN GENERAL WE IMPORT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR POWER THE EXPORTS WERE LARGELY -- OR ARE A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE WERE NON RESOURCE ADEQUACY RESOURCES THESE ARE PLANTS GENERATORS THEY'RE NOT UNDER ANY CONTRACT NOR ARE THEY UNDER ANY OBLIGATION TO SERVE LOADING CALIFORNIA AND IN A FREE MARKET THEY CAN SELL THEIR ELECTRONS TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES ARE REQUIRED TO BEEN INDOOR MARKET AND THEY LARGELY DID AND THEY HELPED US MEET THAT NOW WIN YOUR IN A NET IMPORTER POSITION -- I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY BAD PRACTICE TO CONSIDER CUTTING THESE EXPORTS AS A REGULAR SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM I'LL LEAVE IT THERE BUT I WILL COME BACK TO THAT I WILL THEN TURN -- -- IS A BETTER I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO START THE LAST SLIDE IS THAT NOT CORRECT YES SIR THAT'S RIGHT AND THE LAST SLIDE IS THE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS THAT WE WILL ALL BE TAKING SO TURN TO SLIDE SEVEN AND WE WILL EACH SPEAK TO SOME OF THESE BULLET POINTS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE THREE OF US WILL COORDINATE TO ENSURE THE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF RESOURCES THAT THE CPC HAS ALREADY DIRECTED TO BE PROCURED ARE IN DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE ONLINE NEXT SUMMER THE CPUC ALSO PLANS TO OPEN AN EXPEDITED RULEMAKING TO ADDRESS RELIABILITY FOR SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE IDENTIFYING VARIOUS ACTIONS THAT WILL IMPROVE RELIABILITY IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE RECOGNIZING THAT WHILE WE DO HAVE NEW RESOURCES COMING ON LINE DURING THAT PERIOD WE MAY STILL NEED TO DEAL WITH POTENTIAL SHORTFALL WE WILL BE LOOKING AT DEMAND RESPONSE OTHER LOAD SHIFTING OPTIONS AND OTHER RELIABILITY STEPS WE CAN TAKE RECOGNIZING THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO ORDER NEW SUPPLY SIDE RESOURCES BETWEEN NOW AND THIS COMING SUMMER IN ADDITION THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCEEDING AT THE BBC WE'LL BE LOOKING AT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM IN THE TRACK THREE PROCEEDING WHICH IS ALREADY UNDERWAY WE EXPECT TO HAVE THAT DECISION READY FOR ADOPTION NO LATER THAN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO RESOURCE ADEQUACY YEAR LASTLY WE ARE TAKING ACTION IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN THE I. R. P. PROCEEDING TO ENSURE THAT ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ARE ON TRACK TO PROCURE THEIR SHARE OF REPLACEMENT POWER FOR THE RETIREMENT OF DIAVEL CANYON GENERATING STATION IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN THE I. R. P. SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WE REQUESTED THE LOAD SEVEN SERVING ENTITIES TO REPORT ON THEIR DIET ABELL REPLACEMENT CARMEN IN THE I. R. PEAS THEY FILED WITH US ON SEPTEMBER ONE WE ARE ANALYZING THIS ADMISSION AND WE ANTICIPATE MARC MERO PROCUREMENT AND WILL ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT ORDER IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT THESE RESOURCES COME ONLINE AND THAT THEY NEED THE RELIABILITY NEEDS FOR THE DIABLO RETIREMENT THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE LONGER TERM PROCUREMENT DECISION IN THE I. R. P. THAT WE ANTICIPATE CONSIDERING BY LATE TWENTY TWENTY ONE NOW I'LL TURN TO CHAIR HI SHIELD FOR THE NEXT BULLET POINT YEAH JUST TO ADD TO TO PRESENT ADEQUATE THERE WILL BE A TEN FOLD INCREASE IN ENERGY STORAGE THE PC'S ARE GOING TO BE FOR CARRYING THE NEXT YEAR WHICH IS -- A SIGNIFICANT STEP AND IN ADDITION TO THAT COMMISSION WE HAVE SEVENTY NINE JURISDICTIONAL POWER PLANTS REPRESENTING TWENTY EIGHT GIGAWATTS AND THERE ARE SOME OF FISHING SEE IMPROVEMENTS TO BE FOUND FROM THE EXISTING FLEET PARTICULARLY WITH IMPROVING CHILLED WATER SYSTEMS -- THAT'LL GET MORE JUICE OUT OF -- THE EXISTING FLEET WITH RESPECT TO -- THE THE FORECAST ONE THING WE'RE DOING SO WE HAVE A TEAM OF ABOUT THIRTY PEOPLE ECONOMIST AT ASSERTIONS ENGINEERS THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PRODUCES THIS DEMAND FORECAST EVERY TWO YEARS AND THEN AN INTERIM UPDATE EVERY YEAR SO THAT'S COMING OUT IN JANUARY IN ADDITION THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE GONNA BE DOING A SUMMER ASSESSMENT WHICH IS LOOKING AT ALL OF THE HOURS AND REALLY COMPARING THE SUPPLY STACK TO THOSE NEEDS IN A VERY VERY GRANULAR WAY AND SO I'VE ASKED CIVIL GUNNEDAH OUR DEPUTY IN CHARGE OF OUR ENERGY ASSESSMENTS DIVISION WHO'S GONNA BE COURTING THAT TO JOIN ME TODAY HE'S AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THAT AS WE GET INTO THAT SEGMENT OF THE THE DISCUSSION GO BACK TO STEVE I THINK BACK TO KALISTO YEAH THIS IS -- SINCE -- SINCE I'M STEPPING DOWN MY SUCCESSOR IS HEREBY THESE ARE FUTURE LOOKING ACTIONS -- -- WILL TURN IT OVER TO -- MISTER MAYNES ARE THANK YOU STEVE INSURE HOLDEN VICE CHAIR PATTERSON MEMBERS GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO ENTER INTO THIS MYSELF AND TO SPEAK TO THE PRICE SO ACTIONS GOING FORWARD IS A NATIVE OF SAN FRANCISCO AND A GRADUATE OF UC BERKELEY I'M I'M HONORED AND EXCITED TO HAVE RETURNED CALIFORNIA DURING SUCH A PIVOTAL AND IMPORTANT TIME FOR OUR STATE AS I STEP INTO MY NEW ROLE AS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE PRICE SO I'M COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THE PRICE OF PROVIDES TIMELY ANALYTICALLY RIGOROUS TRANSPARENT AND INTELLECTUALLY HONEST INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO BE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY OBJECTIVES IN A RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT MANNER THE PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS PROVIDES AN INITIAL SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THE PLANNING PROCUREMENT AND MARKET TO SIGN ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS CAUSAL FACTORS IN THE AUGUST FOURTEENTH TO FIFTEENTH ROLLING BLACKOUTS I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY PARTNERS AT THE CPUC NCC TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S RESOURCE ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK RESULTS IN SUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELIABILITY DURING OUR TRANSITION TO A CLEAN RESOURCE MIX FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST WITH THE REST OF THE WEST UNITED STATES RESOURCE ADEQUACY IS JOB NUMBER ONE WE WILL ALSO WORK TO ENSURE THE COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION PROTOCOLS ARE AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE PARTICULARLY WHEN ANTICIPATING HE HOT WEATHER AND STRESSED RATE CONDITIONS CLEARLY WE MUST ACT WITH GREAT URGENCY AND FOCUS SO AS TO AVOID A REPEAT AT THIS SUMMER'S EVENTS NEXT YEAR AND BEYOND AS WE HEARD FROM GOVERNOR NEWSOM I KNOW YOU EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM US BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS THE CASE WAS IDENTIFIED A SET OF IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS MARKET PRACTICES IN THE NEAR TERM TO ENSURE THAT THEY ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ACTUAL BALANCE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND DURING STRESSED OPERATING CONDITIONS FOR EXAMPLE WE INTEND TO CLOSELY EVALUATE UNDER SCHEDULING LOAD IN THE DAY AHEAD MARKET WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP AN INSTITUTE A PROCEDURE THAT ADEQUATELY COMMUNICATES THE NEED TO ACCURATELY SCHEDULE LOAD IN THE DAY AHEAD MARKET THIS WILL BE DONE BY FIRST OF ALL CONTINUING OUR NEW PRACTICE OF NOTIFYING THE MARKET OF THE DEGREE OF UNDERSCORE THE LOAD BASED ON THE PRIOR STAYS RESULTS IF LOTUS UNDER SCHEDULED AND REQUESTING THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES SCHEDULING COORDINATORS PROPERLY SCHEDULE THEIR ANTICIPATED LOAD IN THE DAY AHEAD MARKET WE WILL ALSO INCREASE OUR REACH TO LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TO DISCUSS AND RESOLVE ANY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY SCHEDULE THE AMOUNT OF LOAD IN THE DAY AHEAD MARKET CONSISTENT WITH SYSTEM CONDITIONS WE WILL ENSURE THAT MARKET PROCESS HE'S APPROPRIATELY PRIORITIZE LOAD SERVICE AND EXPORTS THROUGH A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WILL PURSUE ENHANCEMENTS TO KISER RESOURCE ADEQUACY MARKET RULES TO ENSURE THE PLANNED OUTAGES DO NOT CREATE UNNECESSARY RELIABILITY RISK AND THAT PERFORMANCE PENALTIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE SIMILARLY WILL DEVELOP A PROCESS TO EVALUATE MONTHLY RESOURCE ADEQUACY SUPPLY PLANS AND WILL CONDUCT BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT IF THE PLANS ARE INSUFFICIENT IN COORDINATION WITH THE CPUC WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO CLARIFY AND REFINE THE RESOURCE ADDICTS ACCOUNTING RULES AS THEY APPLY TO HYDRO RESOURCES DEMAND RESPONSE RESOURCES RENEWABLES USE LIMITED RESOURCES AND IMPORTS AS WE TAKE ON THESE INITIAL ACTIONS AND COMPLETE THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO SOLICITING INPUT FROM THE WIDE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN OUR SECTOR IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS AND HELP US FORMULATE A LONGER TERM STRATEGY FOR THE RELIABLE DECARBONISATION OF OUR ELECTRICITY GRID ALONG WITH SUPPLY SIDE SOLUTIONS IS ALSO ESSENTIAL THAT WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO EFFICIENTLY INTEGRATE EMERGING STORAGE DEMAND RESPONSE IN DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES INTO OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED SUCH THAT SUCH RESOURCES CAN BE EFFICIENTLY CITED DISPATCHED AND COMPENSATED TO SUPPORT RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND RELIABILITY IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND DECLINING COSTS OF STORAGE RENEWABLE RESOURCES BUT THERE REMAINS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO DO ON THE PATH TO RELIABLY JEFF DECARBONISATION OF OUR GREAT THIS WORK SPANS ISSUES INCLUDING RESOURCE ADEQUACY PLANNING PROCUREMENT RATE DESIGN MARKET DESIGN AND OPERATIONS AND COORDINATION BETWEEN LOAD SERVING ENTITIES DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OPERATORS TECHNOLOGY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE I SO I AM ENTHUSIASTIC AND OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY WORKABLE SOLUTIONS TO THESE IMPORTANT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU IN AN OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE MANNER THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE MYSELF IN TESTIFIED THIS MORNING AND I KNOW ALL OF US IN THE COMING HERE THIS MORNING THE FORTY ANSWERING QUESTIONS OURSELVES WITH ART STARTING WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS THANK YOU AGAIN I CAN CLOSE THE PRESENTATIONS YES SIR YES SIR OKAY WE ARE AT THAT -- WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR -- YOUR YOUR HONESTY AND -- ACCEPTING THE RESPONSIBILITY I KNOW THAT FOR ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THOSE MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT HERE THEIR CONSTITUENTS THE PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE -- -- THIS THAT WAS A REALLY TOUGH AT A TIME CLEARLY TO GO THROUGH AND YOU KNOW I MUST SAY THAT THE CONSERVATION EFFORT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN KEEPING US FROM FOR OF DRIFTING OFF INTO THE ABYSS -- BUT -- WE'RE NOW CONTINUE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND WE COULD LOOK AT THIS AND MAYBE B. AS A THINKER ALLUDING TO BE INSTRUCTIVE FOR HOW WE GO FORWARD AND HOW WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO FORECAST SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF WHAT WE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS YEAR EARLIER HOPEFULLY GOING INTO THE FUTURE PANDEMIC IS NOT PART OF OUR FUTURE -- MUCH LONGER AND THAT CERTAINLY HAD OF ITS ROLE TO PLAY -- BUT -- WE'RE HERE TODAY TO NOT ONLY BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED BUT ALSO THE THING PROSPECTIVELY OF HOW WE CAN BE IN A STRONGER PLACE TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATIONS DR CORK I HAD INDICATED I WOULD TURN TO YOU TO LATER FOR QUESTIONS AND IF MEMBERS HAVE COURSES THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO POSE AT THIS TIME THIS WOULD BE THE TIME DUCTWORK HELLO TO ALL THIS YEAH THE WELL THE VICE CHAIR MADE NO OPENING STATEMENT THAT IMPLIES THAT THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEM WAS TO GIVE UP ONE OUR GOAL OF ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE WE HAVE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH STORAGE WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF SUNSHINE PLENTY OF WIND WE CAN BUILD MORE IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE BUT WE NEED TO STORE AND IT PORTAL NOT BECAUSE DID YOU SEE THAT ARE ONE TO TWO PERCENT THAT WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE GLOBAL PROBLEM OF GREENHOUSE GASES IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SHOW THE REST OF THE WORLD THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES STATE BY STATE THIS CAN BE DONE AND WE CAN BE DONE AT A REASONABLE PRICE THAT WE CAN GET AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS NOW THAT THIS IS STORAGE ALL BREAK FOUR HOURS MAYBE EIGHT HOURS BUT THE SELF DISCHARGE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE LONGER TERM FOR THE LONGER TERM WE'RE GONNA NEED FOR SORT OF A FEW DAYS YOU CAN DO THAT WITH I'M STORAGE OF THE NUMBER -- WONDER WHEN YOU'VE GOT ACCESS ENERGY AND HAVING TO COME DOWN FOR HYDROPOWER BUT THAT'S A GOOD FOR A DAY OR TWO BUT IT'S THESE BATTERIES CAN THE NEXT SITUATION IS WHAT DO WE DO OUR FOR THE LONGER TERM FOR SEASONAL STORAGE N. M. HYDRO IS GOING TO GET TO THEIR I'VE LOOKED AT THE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES I THINK THE WHITE ONE IS HYDROGEN OTHERS TO LOOK AT THIS THE POINT IS WE HAVE NO PLANS AT ALL AND WHATEVER THIS IS IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS TO FIRST OF ALL DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE HOW DO YOU IT EXPENSIVELY -- GENERATED THE STORAGE HI AND HYDROGEN'S PAYS BY SPLITTING THE WATER ADAMS AND THEN HOW DO YOU STORE IT HOW DO YOU GET IT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER WORDS NEEDED THAT'S TREMENDOUS AMOUNT DEVELOPMENT WORK AND NOT A WHOLE LOT OF IMPLEMENTATION WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE FIRST HYDRO BILLS ALL MAKE SURE THAT THESE NUMBERS RIGHT IN JULY TWENTY FIFTEEN THE ISL IN A LETTER TO THE C. P. U. C.

YOU SEE SO -- I DID MENTION MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBER THAT WE ARE ON WE HAVE UNDERWAY NOW AN EXPEDITED RULEMAKING AND TO ADDRESS THE RELIABILITY FOR SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT IS UNDER WAY AND IT WILL MAKE MANY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT ON IN TERMS OF -- -- PUMP STORAGE AND GEOTHERMAL GEOTHERMAL THOSE RESOURCES ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER OF ACHIEVING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS AND ALSO ENSURING RELIABILITY AND THEY'RE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE INTEGRATED PLANNING RESOURCE MODELS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE MIX OF THE RESOURCE IS CONSIDERED IN THOSE MODELS -- THE CURRENT OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL LONG DURATION STORAGE OR PUMP STORAGE -- WROTE RESOURCES REQUIRED -- AS WELL SO HE IS THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON HE IS UP IN THE GALLERY THAT -- I PERHAPS WAS SHORT HANDED OUT WITH THANK YOU FOR THE BETTER YEAH I THINK IT'S CORRECT THAT A SECOND I'VE HAD I'VE HEARD SOUND LOUDER SO I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S CHALLENGES ALL YOU MAKE SURE SO IT IS THIS BETTER WE CAN HEAR YOU FINE HERE I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY TO THAT IS GOING TO GET JUST BECAUSE LOUDEST PROSPECT OKAY -- SO IT IS -- AFTER A GOOD LONG DURATION STORAGE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS IN THIS LAST CYCLE AND -- THERE YOU KNOW WORK IS UNDERWAY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH AND WHAT FORMS WITH WITH BEST A FIT INTO THE PORTFOLIOS THERE IS A SIMPLE QUESTION THAT WE'RE WRESTLING WITH WHICH IS WHO IS GOING TO PROCURE IT -- AS A RESULT OF THE -- CUSTOMER CHOICE INITIATIVES IN THE STATE THE OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE SERVING LESS AND LESS OF THEIR LOAN YEAH THESE TEND TO BE A LONG PLANNING HIGH COST PROJECTS AND ARE -- DECEMBER DECISION THAT REQUIRED THE NEW TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF RESOURCES TO COME ONLINE FOR LIABILITY PURPOSES IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DIRECTED ENTITIES OTHER THAN THE I. O. USED TO ACTUALLY GO OUT OF THE CURE AND SO THAT IS OUR OUR FIRST -- DIRECTIVE IN THAT REGARD AND CLEARLY TO GET THIS LONG DURATION STORAGE THE COMMISSION NEEDS TO DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW IT WILL BE DIRECTING AND WHO WILL BE DIRECTING TO -- INVEST IN THOSE LONGER LOOK THOSE HIGH COST -- LONG LEAD TIME PROJECTS MISTER CHAIR I BELIEVE THAT CHAIR HOPE SHE'LL WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD TO THE -- THE RESPONSE YEAH JUST TO ADD TO THAT -- SO WE FIND ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING A STORAGE PORTFOLIO REFUNDED ABOUT FORTY ENERGY STORAGE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE AND NUMBER ACTUALLY ON MILITARY BASES AND CAMPUSES WITH ALL DIFFERENT CHEMISTRIES YOU KNOW VANADIUM IRON CHROMIUM AS WELL AS LITHIUM ION LITHIUM ION HAS BEEN TO THE WORK FORCE AND THE GOOD NEWS THERE IS THAT THE COST OF LIVING MINUS COME DOWN ABOUT NINETY PERCENT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND THERE IS A PATHWAY FOR PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL CONTINUED REDUCTIONS IN IN COST THERE BUT THERE IS ALSO SOME VERY PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS FOR WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF IN COURT AROUND SEASONAL STORAGE -- ONE OF WHICH WE JUST FUNDED LAST YEAR AND SO EMERGING AND I WOULD JUST SAY THOUGH IT'S A MISTAKE TO VIEW STORAGE IS THE SILVER BULLET IT'S REALLY A SILVER BUCKSHOT SOLUTION STORAGE IS ONE OF THE PIECES THE OTHERS ARE DIVERSITY OF CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES AND THAT INCLUDES YOUR GEOTHERMAL EVEN EVENTUALLY DOING WHAT THEY'VE DONE THESE COST OF OFFSHORE WIND MUCH IMPROVEMENT WE CAN MAKE AROUND -- DEMAND RESPONSE AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC VEHICLES HAVE BEEN BOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND DOING INTELLIGENT CHARGING PROTOCOLS STEPS SO THERE ISN'T ONE SILVER BULLET HERE IT'S MANY STEPS BUT STORAGE IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE THEREFORE ONE OF THE DOCTORS ALL BELIEVE THE CURRENT HYDROPOWER -- STORAGE WHEN I SEE THE R. F. P. GOING NOW TOTAL THAT IT'S JUST FOR AND FOR LONG TERM STORAGE FOR SEASONAL STORAGE YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH BATTERIES THERE ISN'T ENOUGH LITHIUM AND COBALT TO DO IT BY ABOUT A FACTOR OF A HUNDRED SO YOU JUST CAN'T DO IT WITH BATTERIES WE'VE GOT TO DESIGN SOMETHING FOR YOU CAN STORE ENERGY FOR WEEKS AT A TIME THE VARIETY OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED I WANT TO SEE YOUR PLANS FOR DOING IT AND I WANNA SEE YOU START DEVELOPING IT NOW I THINK I HEARD THE -- THE WITNESSES DESCRIBE IT AS OF NOT ONE SINGLE SILVER BULLET BUT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING I DON'T INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR -- CORPORATE AND YEAH I WOULD BECAUSE I'M JUST GONNA MAKE A VERY QUICK STATEMENT AND THEN TRANSITION TO DOCTOR EGGMAN BUT WHAT I HEARD WAS THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS TO KIND OF GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE A LONG DURATION PUMP STORAGE COULD PROBABLY PART OF THAT SOLUTION DR THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION TODAY -- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A A A DIFFICULT TOPIC IN A IN A IN A MASSIVE PUZZLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND CLEANEST WAY POSSIBLE I WILL ALSO SAY SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY IN THE DELTA AREA AND THE HEAT THAT WE EXPERIENCE -- IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC IN THE MIDST OF WILDFIRES TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT TURNING OFF YOUR POWER CREATED ANXIETY LIKE I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED IN MY COMMUNITY FOUR IN IN MY IN MY LIFETIME ASSEMBLY WHO CHAIRS THE AGRICULTURE COMMISSION TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE COST OF A POWER THE COST OF OF WHAT IT TAKES TO SHUT DOWN IS -- IT WILL TAKE IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO RECOVER FROM SO I WENT ONLINE SO MY COMMENTS WITH THE -- MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CORK -- THAT WE NEED LONG TERM STORAGE I HAD A I HAD A -- A BILL LAST YEAR THAT I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO REVISIT THAT AND WE NEED TO DO IT WE CAN'T JUST KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT IT'S GOT TO BE PLANNED IT'S GOT TO BE WE NEED TO HAVE A GOAL OUT THERE AND THIRTY WHEN I HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT NEXT YEAR I THINK ABOUT AS I AM APPROACHING AGE OF RETIREMENT RIGHT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RETIREMENT BUT WE'RE JUST PLANNING YEAR BY YEAR WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER TO GET THERE IF WE JUST ARE PLANNING ON FOR NEXT YEAR WE CAN'T GET THERE SO I THINK THE LONG TERM PLANS NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED PLANNED AND IMPLEMENTED AND SEE THE R. PEAS GO OUT ON THE ISSUE OF MY MORAL OR IMMORAL -- ELECTRONS I FOUND THAT FASCINATING OF THE AS AS AS A GOOD CATHOLIC I ALSO BELIEVE IN IN FORGIVENESS AND AND DEGREES OF OF WHAT WE CAN DO -- SO I'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE IS EXPAND OFFSHORE WIND I LIKE TO SEE US DO MORE WITH WITH BIOMASS AND I NEED YOU TO TELL US WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE THINGS HAPPEN SO WE CAN HAVE A CONSISTENT BASELOAD BOTH IN THE FOREST FIRES AND I WE LOST A PLACE WITH A LITTLE OFF THE GRID AND HAD TO RELY ON THE SOLAR NEVER WORKED I COULD NEVER GET MY MY PROPANE REFRIGERATOR MY SOLAR POWER ALL TO WORK AT THE SAME TIME BUT NOW WOULD BURN TO THE GROUND SO IT'S A REALLY A NEW ISSUE -- BUT I CAN TELL YOU GOING UP THERE AND THE IMPACT THAT I STILL HAVE A MY LOANS FROM THE SMOKE THAT CAME DOWN HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY TO SIT IN THE VALLEY IS UNACCEPTABLE RIGHT AND THE AMOUNT OF OF OF THE REASON WE NEED TO TAKE OUT OF OUR FORCED THE AMOUNT OF WASTE THAT IS GENERATED BY OUR AG THAT WE NEED THEY NEED TO BE TO PRUNE WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH ALL OF THAT AND THE CLEANER ENERGY WE CAN MAKE SOME OF THAT AGAIN MANAGE OUR BASE I THINK IT'S JUST A SMARTER WAY TO GO WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO TURN OUR BACK ON OUR FLOORS AND OUR HAGMAN'S NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE THEM IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY TO INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CAPACITY IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE VALLEY WHO HAVE EXTREME HEAT AND EXTREME POVERTY THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHY THEY HAVE TO TURN THEIR POWER AND SO I WILL BUY ABOVE EXPRESSED SOME OF THE URGENCY THAT WE ALL FEEL TO ADDRESS THIS THE QUESTIONS THAT WE GET MORE AT HOME ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND AND REALLY LOOK AT EVERY SYSTEM ON THE TABLE TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE IT IN A LONG TERM FOR A LONG TERM GOAL BUT IN SHORT TERM STEPS THAT WE CAN ALL SEE AND CHECK OFF A YEAR BY YEAR ARE WE NEEDING THOSE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE ULTIMATE TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT AND KEEP LOTS OF MR KING MISS RAYOS GARCIA MISTER THANK YOU MR LOTS OF THANK YOU TO ALL THE LEADERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION FOR AND REALLY BEING HERE TODAY -- HAVEN'T HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUES -- ONE PARTICULAR AREA OBVIOUSLY IS TO SURE THAT WE ARE DOING DOING THE PROPER REGULATION REGARDING OUR ENERGY PROCESS AND IN PARTICULAR TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE EXPEDITING THE PROCUREMENT BUT ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AS WELL AS BATTERY STORAGE -- OBVIOUSLY YOUR AGENCIES ARE NOT THOUGHT OF AS NIMBLE WE KNOW THAT WE NEED THIS ENERGY WE NEEDED THIS ENERGY YESTERDAY AND QUITE OFTEN FRANKLY AT THE SAME THAT WE HAVE A -- -- A PROCESS FOR A MANAGER TO SOME OF THE MISNOMER WE WE HAVE A NINETEENTH CENTURY ENERGY SYSTEM WHERE YOU GENERATE ENERGY AND YOU HAVE TO USE IT IMMEDIATELY WE DON'T REALLY MANAGER WE WE GENERATED AND WE USE IT AND WE HOPE TO YOU KNOW WE NEED IT WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO BUY IT FROM SOMEWHERE THAT'S BEING GENERATED SO IF YOU COULD REALLY SPEAK TO HOW YOUR AGENCIES ARE UPDATING YOUR SPECIFIC PROCESSES SO THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE YEARS AND YEARS TO -- PURCHASE DEVELOP NEW ENERGY AND I WOULD LIKE IN PARTICULAR TO HAVE HIGH SO -- TALK ABOUT HOW YOU ARE BETTER MANAGING THE ENERGY BECAUSE I THINK THIS WORD MANAGING OF THE ENERGY SYSTEM IS SORT OF A MY PASSWORD BUT A MISNOMER I CAN SPEAK A BIT TO THE PLANNING -- MR TANG -- WE WE DO HAVE LONGER TERM PLANNING WE PLAN THE YEAR AHEAD THREE YEARS AND FIVE YEARS -- ARE ARE PLANNING CYCLE ALONG WITH THE FORECASTING AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE ALL SHARE TOGETHER AND I WILL LET CHAIRMAN HOPE SHE'LL SPEAK TO THE FORECASTING -- AS WELL AND AS I MENTIONED WE DO HAVE UNDERWENT EXPEDITED -- I OUR RULEMAKING PROCEEDING THAT WILL INDEED LOOK AT SOME OF THE RESOURCES FOR THIS COMING YEAR SO THERE'S A SHORT TERM AND AND A LONG TERM EFFORT IT'S ALWAYS UNDER WAY AT THE PC I WILL SAY THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN AT THE PC MISTER CHANG THIS LAST YEAR -- I HAVE BEEN -- I HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT HOW QUICKLY AND MORE NIMBLE NOTHING NICHOLAS BUT MORE NIMBLE THE AND PC HAS BECOME JUST AS AN EXAMPLE WE WERE ABLE TO START INCOMPLETE THE PGA ANY BANKRUPTCY RULE MAKING IN EIGHT MONTHS AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE WERE DOING OUR A AND I. R. P. WORK ALL THE WHILE WE WERE ALSO DOING THE T. MOBILE AND MERGER WE FINISHED AND DURING THAT SAME SIX MONTH OR EIGHT NINE MONTH PERIOD THE -- MICROGRID PHASE TWO RULEMAKING I STARTED THE TELCO PROCEEDINGS THAT GO TO THE TELCO EFFORTS UNDER P. S. P. S. SO IT IS TRUE WE HAVE SOME PRETTY ARCHAIC PROCESSES AT THE PC BUT WE'VE BEEN MOVING IN A MUCH MORE SWIFT I THINK LESS BUREAUCRATIC MANNER IT LEAST IN MY TWELVE MONTHS OF BEING ON THE ON THE COMMISSION -- DAVID WOULD YOU I CAN'T SEE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK OKAY STEVE I CAN'T SEE YOU I'M SORRY -- WELL I'LL GO AHEAD AND TRY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THESE THINGS -- THANK YOU AND MISTER TANK -- YOU KNOW LET ME JUST BE A LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE ANSWERING THIS WE WE DEFINITELY FIRST OF ALL I WANT EVERYBODY TO ESTABLISH THAT WE REGULARLY OPERATE THE GRID AT OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE LOAD SERVED BY -- BASICALLY SOLAR AND WIND REGULARLY WERE RECOGNIZED AROUND THE WORLD AS THAT AND WE'VE HAD ABOUT EIGHTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS COME TO THE I SO TO SEE HOW WE'RE DOING IT AND WHAT WE'RE DOING RECOGNIZED AS HAVING A MARKET THAT IS VERY FORWARD LEANING TO AND I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WE ALLOW AS AN EXAMPLE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES OR ANY DISTRIBUTED ASSET TO COME INTO OUR MARKETS AS AN AGGREGATION THAT CAPABILITY IS THERE WE'RE ALSO LEARNING HOW TO OPERATE THE GRID AS AN EXAMPLE A A VERY LARGE BATTERY OVER TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATTS CALLED THE GATEWAY BATTERY -- CAME ONLINE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND HOW YOU CHARGE AND DISCHARGE AT BATTERY THE SOMETHING WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT AS AN EXAMPLE IF IT'S A TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATT BATTERY IT CAN CHARGE TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATTS IT CAN DISCHARGED TO AN AMERICAN WHAT'S IN IT CAN TURN ON A DIME WHICH IS A FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS SWING WHEN YOU HAVE TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE ON THE SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT SWING SO WE'RE LEARNING ON HOW TO INTEGRATE THOSE THINGS IN OUR MARKET SO WE ARE THIS NEW REALITY ALSO NOTE THAT WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF TIMES WERE RESEARCH OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE LOAD -- WITH RENEWABLES SO I THINK THE STATE IS MAKING VERY GOOD PROGRESS YOU KNOW I I MEAN I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I THINK WE HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE GOALS AND I THINK THAT THE FOUR OF YOU -- YEAH SURE OUR SENSE OF URGENCY AND OUR DESIRE TO REALLY MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION I THINK MY CONCERN ISN'T ISN'T EVEN THAT THE LEADERSHIP FOR THE THREE OF YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD REALLY WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN REALLY MOVE YOUR INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES I MEAN JUST FOR EXAMPLE THE TYPE OF THE PRODUCT THAT I MEAN DEMAND RESPONSE WE HAVE SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION IN THE ENERGY AREA JUST IN THE STATE ALONE DEMAND RESPONSE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT -- BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE ARE ADEQUATELY EMBRACING -- THAT WE NEED I THINK THAT IS I THINK WHERE WE'RE FEELING THE CONCERN BECAUSE YOU YOU HEARD IT FROM THE GOVERNOR I KNOW YOU HEARD IT DIRECTLY FROM THE GOVERNOR YOU HEARD IT FROM US BUT WE WE HEARD IT WE REALLY HEARD FROM MY CONSTITUENTS AND -- THIS TYPE OF -- ENERGY SHORTFALL IS JUST SORT OF INEXCUSABLE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE ON A REGULAR BASIS OVER PROCURE ABOUT MY UNDERSTAND ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE ENERGY THAT WE NEED WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHICH INCREASES RATES WHICH INCREASES COSTS SO IT SEEMS ODD THAT AT THE TIME THAT EVEN THOUGH WE REGULARLY OVER FOR SURE ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE ENERGY THAT WE NEED THAT WE STILL WERE NOT ABLE TO MEET OUR ENERGY NEEDS ON THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH OF AUGUST SUGGEST I THINK GOING BACK TO MY QUESTION WHY DIDN'T HEAR IS I HEARD SORT OF HIGH LEVEL HEY WE'RE WE'RE DOING BETTER BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW SPECIFIC MORE MORE SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOUR AGENCIES ARE DOING TO SPEED UP THE ABILITY TO GET RENEWABLE ENERGY ONLINE AND ALSO TO MAKE IT MORE RELIABLE SO WE TALKED ABOUT I THINK SURE HOPE SHE'LL TALK ABOUT ENERGY STORAGE IS BEING OBVIOUSLY ONLY ONE OF MANY THINGS YOU HAVE BATTERY STORAGE YOU HAVE ELECTRIC CARS YOU HAVE YOU HAVE FOR DEMAND RESPONSE ALL THESE ARE VERY STRATEGIES BUT WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON HOW TO INTEGRATE EACH OF THESE STRATEGIES MORE QUICKLY BECAUSE JUST FROM OUR I'LL JUST TELL YOU FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT IT SEEMS TO MOVE AT A FAIRLY GLACIAL THANKS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE SPEED OF OUR STATE AND HOW FAST THINGS ARE CHANGING I CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF THE NEAR TERM THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AS I SAID WE WE ARE HAVING AN EXPEDITED RULEMAKING PROCESS THAT WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE OUTLINED TODAY -- WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT DEMAND RESPONSE AND AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BRINGING TECHNOLOGIES TO IT AS WELL AS ON FLEX ALERT FRANKLY OF FIVE FLEX ALERT IS ANOTHER -- LOVERS THAT WE PULLED SUCCESSFULLY DURING THE FOURTEENTH AND THE FIFTEENTH AND AGAIN IN EARLY SEPTEMBER HEAT WAVE -- AND WE WE HAVE ALL AGREED ON THAT FLEX ALERT NEEDS TO BE MODERNIZED PEOPLE BE ABLE WE NEED TO HAVE AN APP TYPE OF PROCESS WHERE CUSTOMERS CAN -- BE ENGAGED IN THE FLEX IN A MUCH MORE TECHNOLOGICAL MANNER THAT WE ARE NOW DOING IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN LOOKED AT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS SO WE HAVE TO DO THAT -- IMMEDIATELY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT IN THE SHORT TERM THE IN BOTTOM LINE -- HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT BUT I CAN GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS THE ENERGY STORAGE WE WILL HAVE ONE THOUSAND FOUR SIXTY ONE MEGAWATTS BROUGHT ON BY NEXT SUMMER IN ENERGY STORAGE AND SOLAR PLUS STORAGE WILL HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MEGAWATTS ON BOARD ONLINE SKEWS ME SELLER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MEGAWATTS WIN A HUNDRED ELEVEN AND OTHER WHICH IS MOSTLY GEOTHERMAL BE ABOUT TWELVE MEGAWATTS FOR ALMOST TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS THAT WILL BE ONLINE BY EIGHT ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT'S IN THE IN THE SHORT TERM -- AREA THAT WE WILL BE BRINGING ON I THINK MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE SOME OTHER POINTS TO MAKE YEAH I GUESS I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT MEAN ONE SECTOR AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING IS THE BUILDING SECTOR SO THROUGH OUR CODES AND STANDARDS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION WE'RE HELPING ENSURE THAT THE BUILDINGS CAN BE INTELLIGENT AS THEY INTERACT LOAD MANAGEMENT STANDARDS WHICH IS BASICALLY PLATFORM IT'S GONNA REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO -- TO BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE THAT THESE FEATURES THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW A FOR -- SMART TECHNOLOGY TO HELP ADJUST AND MODULATE DEMANDED REAL TIME TO ONE HIGHER LEVEL THEME THAT I'M HEARING AND SOME OF THE COMMENTS TODAY WHICH IS THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THE CARBONIZATION IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH RELIABILITY ONE INTERESTED REALLY ADDRESS THAT DIRECTLY BECAUSE IF YOU ASK THE QUESTION WHAT ARE THE TOP THREATS TO GRID RELIABILITY THE CITY CALIFORNIA LAST TWENTY YEARS RIGHT AND LOOK AT HOW THAT STACKS UP AGAINST CLEAN ENERGY RIGHT SO YOU HAVE THE ENERGY CRISIS THE TWO THOUSAND ONE WHICH WAS MARKET MANIPULATION CAUSED BY COMPANIES LIKE ENRON IF THIRTY EIGHT STATES THREE EMERGENCIES IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AGAIN CLEARLY PERFORM RELIABLY THAT -- SONGS GOING DOWN SANOFI PLAYSTATION TWENTY TWELVE OF RENEWABLES CONTINUE TO POOR PERFORMER LIVELY DURING THAT THE METCALF SUBSTATION ATTACK THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SILICON VALLEY AGAIN RENEWABLES PERFORMER LIVELY AND LISA CANYON TWENTY FIFTEEN THE PS PS EVENTS THAT WE'VE HAD SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THROUGHOUT ALL THESE RENEWABLES HAVE CONTINUED TO PERFORM RELIABLY AND YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE SUITE OF TECHNOLOGY I'VE BEEN REALLY FORTUNATE JOB I INNER INTERFACE ALL THE TIME WITH INNOVATORS AROUND THE STATE LOOKING AT THE SUITE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT'S COMING ACTUALLY REALLY INSPIRING THERE ARE A LOT OF SOLUTIONS -- SOME OF WHICH ARE HERE RIGHT NOW ONE THING THAT WE FUNDED -- WAS ONLY CONNECT THE COMPANY FUNDED -- WITH MONEY COLLECTED BY THE PC THE GIVEN OUT TO RAPID PROGRAM THEY SAVE YOU KNOW GIGAWATT HOUR OF POWER THEY HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND -- YOU KNOW CUSTOMERS AROUND THE STATE PEOPLE TURN OFF JUST THESE THESE WHEN YOU HAVE A BLACK OFTEN IT'S JUST VERY VERY FINITE AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THE GREATEST SUPER STRESSED SO ALL OF THOSE THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT -- RATHER THOUSAND PUTS PEOPLE TURN OUT THE LIGHTS -- CAN HELP AND DOES HELP AND WE'RE GETTING A LOT SMARTER ABOUT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK THE OLD VISION THE OLD PHILOSOPHY WAS DEMAND IS THE STATIC BEING THAT'S UNCHANGED INTERCEPTED ME GENERATION THAT PROVIDER IS TO MEET THAT DEMAND AND AND REALLY WHAT WE'RE FINDING THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT DEMAND THAT CAN BE MOVED IF YOU'RE AND THAT INCLUDES PRE COOLEY OF BUILDINGS AND CHARGING OF ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUS FLEETS AND ALL THIS STUFF SO I THINK WE THIS IS A SOLVABLE PROBLEM WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOOLS UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO HELP US GET THERE HELLO COMPLETED IT'S CLEAR THAT ACTUALLY DECARBONISATION IN THE NEW ENERGY -- CONTINUE TO WORK THAT THAT WAS COMPLETELY RELIABLE THERE THERE WERE NO MUCH THEY WOULD GENERATE HOW MUCH ENERGY WOULD GENERATE THE ENERGY WAS GENERATED -- I THINK THE KEY THAT YOU HIGHLIGHT IT IS WE NEED TO BETTER MANAGE THE DEMAND SIDE THAT'S WHY I THINK DEMAND RESPONSES SO IS SO CRITICAL I DO I DO THINK IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE BETTER -- BETTER LOOK AT HOW WE CAN MAKE THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SIDE MUCH MORE RELIABLE WELL I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT WE COULD USE TO MAKE A MORE RELIABLE AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVEN BEGUN TO REALLY -- UTILIZE THOSE TOOLS YOU YOU MENTIONED -- I THINK I THINK YOU HAVE A COMPANY WHICH IS INCENTIVIZING CUSTOMERS NOT TELLING CUSTOMERS BUT THERE IS INVITING CUSTOMERS TO USE LESS ENERGY SO CUSTOMERS HAVE THAT CHOICE AND IT WORKS THEN THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT THE STATE IS EQUIVALENT TO OUR FIVE FORGOT HOW MANY POWER PLANTS SO AGAIN THIS IS A GROUP OF THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HOMES THANK YOU TURN OFF I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S A REALLY POOR TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT AND THAT THAT'S A SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED VERY VERY QUICKLY AND AGAIN IT'S AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO PEOPLE SIGN ON VOLUNTARILY I THINK AGAIN AGAIN I THINK IT'S JUST IMPERATIVE THAT WE SPEED UP OUR SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO APPROVED THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES QUICKER TO BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO OUR SYSTEMS QUICKER I KNOW IT'S IT'S A IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS BUT I THINK WE STILL TAKE WAY TOO LONG TO MOVE INTO -- INSURING THAT WE HAVE ALL DISCOVER NEW BLENDER G. AS WELL AS A NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT WITHOUT FAITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING THERE MR IF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ALL OF YOUR FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT JUST IT ALONG THE LINES OF STORAGE I DID WANT TO ASK A QUESTION AND FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO BEGIN BY ALIGNING MY COMMENTS WITH THE DOCTOR QUIRK I THINK THAT HIS THE HIS COMMENTS ALWAYS EXPRESSED EXACTLY HOW WE'RE FEELING WE'RE JUST WE FEEL THAT THERE ISN'T A SENSE OF URGENCY AS THERE SHOULD BE AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SENATE WHICH SAID THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES WE'VE HAD NUMBER OF HEARINGS WHAT WE KEEP SAYING THE SAME THING THE -- MISTER TEAM TALKED ABOUT IT AS WELL DR EGGMAN JUST TALKED ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY OTHERWISE WE WILL HAVE A HEARING NEXT YEAR WILL BE SAYING THE SAME THING AND WE WILL HEAR THAT WE'RE MOVING ALONG WE'RE MOVING ALONG COUNTESS ANISE PARTNERS WE WANT TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BECAUSE WHEN YOU SUCCEED THEN THE REST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE GOING TO BE SERVED PROPERLY NOW ON THE ISSUE OF STORAGE I THE FORMER CHAIRMAN JOHN WILLING HOME WROTE THE CALIFORNIA HAS MORE THAN FIFTY I'M SORRY FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY MEGAWATTS OF BEHIND THE METER BATTERY CAPACITY THE COULD HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON TO REDUCE LOADED BUT ONLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN MEGAWATTS WERE USED THE NEW YORK TIMES WROTE ABOUT THIS AS WELL WROTE WE WERE ALREADY ABLE TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF BLACKOUTS AND MY FIRST QUESTION IS WHY WASN'T THIS FULL BETTER BATTERY CAPACITY UTILIZED WELL THE BEST I CAN ANSWER THAT IS -- THE BATTERIES -- DO PRESENT THEMSELVES IN OUR MARKET AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS OFFERED AND WAS DISPATCHABLE WAS USED -- SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOMETHING STILL OUT THERE THAT'S NOT BEING OFFERED INTO THE MARKET AND WE WILL TAKE THAT IS -- SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO BUT YOU'RE NOT HEARING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME I MEAN YOU ARE AWARE THAT THIS CRITICISM HAD BEEN LEVELLED WELL I MEAN THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE INCIDENT HAS BEEN VIEWED FROM ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT LENSES -- I WILL SAY THIS THAT I DO THINK CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNLOCK ALL THESE RESOURCES AND WE WILL ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO DO THAT I CAN TELL YOU THE I SO DOES NOT DO PROCUREMENT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT WE OPERATE THE GRID AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE GIVEN TO US WE TRY TO OPTIMIZE AMONG OPERATE THEM AS BEST WE CAN WE DO HAVE STORAGE INDOOR MARKETS BELIEVE THAT THE MISTER WHELAN OFFICE REFERRING TO IS BEHIND THE METER -- THERE AT HOMES WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DIRECTLY IT HAS TO COME THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY OF SOME SIDE OF SOME TIED WHICH GENERALLY MEANS THERE HAS TO BE A PROCUREMENT PROGRAM TO GO PROCURE IT TO BE ABLE TO OFFER INTO OUR MARKET SO -- WE WILL I KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT -- BADGERING HER TEAM ARE -- URGENTLY LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENTS AND THAT INDEED COULD BE PART OF IT AND IF I MIGHT -- YOU ALIGN YOURSELF WITH DOCTOR KORB WHO ARE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AND INSIGHTS ON THESE THINGS I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT STORAGE IS GOING TO BE A CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THE SOLUTION IT IS NOT THE SILVERBOLT FOR EVERYTHING THOUGH BECAUSE IT ITSELF DOESN'T GENERATE ANY POWER AND FURTHERMORE YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU USE IT OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST CHARGING IT WITH NON YEAH WITH GHG EMITTING RESOURCES SO THAT HAS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT IN THE STORE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO BE ACROSS ALTERATIONS IS DOCTOR COURT DISORDERLY ON -- TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK FOR OUR LITHIUM ION BATTERIES WILL NOT SOLVE THIS LONG TERM MEMBER I CAN -- TRYING TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION AS WELL WHAT STEVE JUST SAID HOWEVER AS AS -- THE CHAIRMAN HARSH SHIELD SAID THERE GOT TO BE ON MANY THINGS IN OUR TOOLBOX AND WE HAVE TO UTILIZE ALL OF THEM AND WE WE DO HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY WE HAVE TOLD -- THE GOVERNOR AND TODAY EXPRESSING OURSELVES TO YOU ALL WE CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION AGAIN FACED US IN AUGUST AND FACES IN SEPTEMBER THANKFULLY WE DID NOT HAVE TO HAVE ANY BLACKOUTS IN SEPTEMBER I'M IN TERMS OF THE PROCUREMENT I'M GOING TO TURN TO PETE SCALA WHO IN A FROM THE UC TO ADDRESS -- MORE DEEPLY YOUR CONCERNS MEMBERS PETER YOU UP THERE YES I AM SO I I DID WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THIS QUESTION OF HOW THE METER STORAGE OR BEHIND THE METER HYBRID SOLAR AND STORAGE PARTICIPATING IN THE MARKET AND AND -- THERE WAS A QUESTION IN THE WHITE PAPER -- THIS MORNING ABOUT -- WORKSHOP IT WAS CANCELED SEVERAL TIMES THAT WHICH PERHAPS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS A SENSE OF URGENCY -- THAT WORKSHOP SO SO -- IN THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCEEDING TEED UP AND DIRECTED THE SAME THREE AGENCIES TO HOLD A JOINT WORKSHOP TO EXPLORE WHAT THE BARRIERS OPPORTUNITIES AND BARRIERS ARE FOR THAT RESOURCE AND UNFORTUNATELY THE THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS SAID PRINCIPALS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN RESPONDING TO AN DEVELOPING THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS -- WE'RE THE ONES TO BE ORGANIZING AND PRESENTING IN THOSE WORKSHOPS SO SO FIRST IT WAS CANCELED DISTINCT GIVE US TIME TO START DEVELOPING THIS REPORT AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY THE SECOND WORKSHOP DATE WAS SCHEDULED FOR THE DAY OF THE RELEASE OF THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS SO WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON SETTING UP FINDING A TIME THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF THE PRINCIPALS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN BEING INVOLVED IN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION -- IN THAT WORKSHOP SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE HEAR YOU AND WE DO INDEED INTEND TO SET SOMETHING UP IN THE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE THAT THOSE RESOURCES CAN CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN AS DEMAND RESPONSE SO -- YOU KNOW THEY THEY CAN -- REDUCE LOADING THE CREDIT FOR REDUCING LOAD UP TO THE AMOUNT OF THE PROPERTY THE METER THEY'RE LOCATED AT THE QUESTION IS HOW TO GO ABOUT ALLOWING THEM TO TO PRODUCE AND AND EXPORT MORE THAN THAT CREDIT FOR THAT PARTICULARLY DURING HIGH DEMAND THIS THANK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION IS THAT IN RESPONSE TO THE ISSUES THAT OCCURRED CAL AYE SO SO THEY WILL PURSUE MARKET ROOM ENHANCEMENTS THROUGH ITS STAKEHOLDER PROCESS COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BUT THIS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND PLEASE TELL US WHO THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE SURE -- I'LL TAKE THAT THE THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SO WE HAVE A A TERRIFIED THAT WE FILE WITH THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS WHEN WE HAVE A STAKEHOLDER SO IT IS TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT PRACTICES THAT WILL BE IN THAT TERROR IN THIS CASE WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT SCHEDULING PRACTICES AS AN EXAMPLE THE STAKEHOLDERS WE WILL HAVE AN OPEN STAKEHOLDER PROCESS ANYONE CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS GENERALLY WHO DOES PARTICIPATE OR LOAD SERVING ENTITIES THE PEOPLE -- CCA'S -- THE UTILITIES -- ALSO POWER GENERATORS -- DEVELOPERS ALL ALL WALKS CAN COME INTO OUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WHAT WE WILL DO IS WE WILL PRESENT SO THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT THIS AND THEN WE WILL BEGIN TO HAVE A SERIES OF MEETINGS TO SEE AS AN EXAMPLE HOW WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THE -- THE PROCESS FOR SCHEDULING AS AN EXAMPLE LET'S SAY WE APPLY A PENALTY TO THAT NOW THAT HAS TO GET FILE THAT FOR AND FOR CAST TO APPROVE THAT THAT'S IN SUMMARY THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS BUT IT IT INCLUDES IT'S AN OPEN TRANSPARENT PROCESS THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THAT AND ONE LAST QUESTION I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BUT I'LL JUST ASK ONE MORE QUESTION BUT MANY MY COLLEAGUES SEVENTY QUESTIONS -- WE ARE HEARING FOR MANY OF OF WORK OUR PEOPLE FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS IN OUR RESPECTIVE AREAS AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT IT TAKES THREE TO SIX MONTHS FOR THEIR SOLAR PANEL AND BATTERY SYSTEMS TO GET APPROVED TO TURN ON THEIR SYSTEMS THESE SYSTEMS REDUCE LOAD ON THE GRID TO PROVIDE RESILIENCE TO PEOPLE'S HOMES WHAT CAN YOU DO TO CUT DOWN THIS WAITING PERIOD AND ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT CAN THINK THAT'S FOR ME -- I THINK YOU'RE GOOD ADDRESSING THE INTERCONNECTION -- -- DIFFICULTIES YEAH AT THE DISTRIBUTION LEVEL I THINK DIFFICULTY IN AND I -- WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO SOLVE -- THAT THE INTERCONNECTIONS ARE SPED UP AGAIN I WANT TO TURN TO PETE IF YOU HAVE SOME SPECIFICS IN ANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS TO TO WORK THE INTERCONNECTION -- TIME FRAMES SO UNFORTUNATELY I THAT IS NOT MY SIDE OF THE SHOP AND ENERGY DIVISION SO I THINK WE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION BUT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ON HIM IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO MY OFF ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING ONE OF MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS ON HAVE HAS THAT PROCEEDING AND I WILL GET THE SPECIFICS GARCIA THANK YOUNG AND ACTUALLY START OFF WITH A COMMON LEAST WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT A ONE AND THIRTY FIVE YEARS OCCURRENCE WITH THIS HEAT WAVE IT'S ABOUT OCTOBER STARTING ANOTHER HEAT WAVE TODAY -- WE MAKE THESE STATEMENTS ARE ONE IN THIRTY FIVE YEARS BASED ON PACIFISTIC BUT I FIND THAT TO BE A RELIABLE GIVEN THAT EVERY YEAR WE'RE MAKING NEW RECORDS BREAKING NEW RECORDS OUT THERE AND SO ARE WE PLANNING BEYOND THIS ONE IN A THIRTY FIVE YEAR OF THE UNKNOWN OUT THERE THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S HARD TO PROJECT AS ITS NEW EVERY YEAR AND SO OKAY YEAH START WITH THAT ON THE FIRST QUESTION RIGHT I'LL I'LL START UP AND THEN I'LL TURN TO EARN CHAIR HARSH SHIELD WE IN IN MY REMARKS IN OURS THIS MORNING WE REALIZE THAT -- SOME OF THESE OCCURRENCES OF HEAT WAVES AS I SAID YEAH AND THE IT'S ABSOLUTELY SCREAMING THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS UPON US AND OUR PLANNING PROCESSES AND ARE FORECASTING PROCESSES MUST NEED THAT AND -- SO WE ARE INDEED LOOKING AT AT CHANGING AND THE NEXT SO THAT WE HAVE A PLANNING PROCESS THAT MEETS SOME OF THESE OCCURRENCES AND WE HAVE TO DO IT IN AN AFFORDABLE AND A NUMBER RELIABLE MANNER IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HOW WE ON SCHEDULE HOW WE PROCURE -- -- FOR THESE INSTANCES THAT ARE COMING ON ON TO US ALL THAT MUCH MORE QUICKLY YEAH IF I COULD ACTUALLY JUST AS SPECIFIC GOING TO WHO PERFORMS THAT DEMAND FORECASTS ARE TALKING ABOUT TO SPEAK TO THIS SERVER MORNING CHAT HOLDEN -- BY SHARE AND CAN YOU SPEAK UP SEVENTH A HARD TO HEAR YEAH M. GOOD MORNING -- BUDGET HOLDEN FIVE I SURE PATTERSON AND THE REST OF THE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- I'M SEVEN DAVID THE ENERGY COMMISSION SO OUR TEAM OF ABOUT THIRTY STAFF MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THE FORECAST A SET OF FORECASTS THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION ADOPTS SO AS A PART OF THE FORECASTING PROCESS -- WE AT DUBLIN A NEW COMPLETELY -- REVISED FORECAST AB TWO YEARS AS A WE TAKE NEW ASSUMPTIONS SO WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS THAT ARE CHANGING FROM REPUTABLE SOURCES -- SUCH AS A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WHICH EXCLUDES RANCH -- WEATHER DATA AND SO ON AND WE DOUBLED EVERY TWO YEARS AND IN THE INTERVENING YEARS WE DO AN UPDATE THAT BECAUSE -- THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGES ON THE DEMAND SIDE WITH MORE AND MORE PT GROWING MORE MORE ACTIVE VEHICLES GOING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN DOING A NEW FORECAST EVERY YEAR SO JUST GONNA MAKE SURE WE SET UP THE PROCESS -- YES EARLIER -- PRESIDENT DODGER SPOKE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING A SET OF FORECAST AND THAT FLEW IN TO HAVE AN IDEA OF PLANNING PROCESS SIX SO WHAT WE DO CURRENTLY THOUGH THAT IS NOT JUST ONE FORECAST INTO FORECAST A ONE IN FIVE ONE IN TEN AND A ONE IN TWENTY SO WE WE PUT THOSE FORECAST OUT FOR AT VEGAS PLANNING PROCESS SEES AND SPECIFICALLY FOR THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCESS AT CPAC -- WE USE THE ONE INTO FORECAST SO THE FORECAST AVAILABLE IT'S ABOUT HOW WE USE THEM AND WE HAD WE WANT TO USE THEM SO SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF WHETHER WE'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT AS SOME OF THE -- CHANGING COMPETITORS TO H. AS THE WEATHER YES WE DO THAT OF FORECASTING ONE IS THE LONG TERM WHICH IS THE TEN YEAR WHERE WE ACTUALLY -- DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT'S USED EACH YEAR SO THAT'S A LONG TERM PROCESS AND THAT IS SPECIFICALLY GOING INTO -- THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS AND WE ALSO DOUBLE UP IN EIGHTY SEVEN SIXTY FIVE SO BASICALLY AN HOURLY FORECAST OVER THE TEN YEARS WHICH GOES INTO THE I. R. P. PROCESS ANDERSON AT THE SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY IS CALLED THE THEATER HAD PEAK FORECAST SO THAT THAT PARTICULAR ONE WE DO CONSIDER -- THE DECENT WEATHER WE DO WE DO CAN CONSIDER DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FORECAST THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE THANK YOU I MEAN AND I'LL BE A LITTLE CRITICAL WE HAVE THE SYSTEMS BUT THEY STILL BUILD US UP FOR TWO DAYS IN A ROW AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT WE TAKE THIS AS A LEARNING LESSON THAT YOU KNOW WELL I I KNOW IT'S HARD TO PREDICT HOW THE SEND MAIL TO THAT WAS HARD TO PREDICT THE PANDEMIC THIS CALL THE OTHER ONE AROUND THE CORNER SO WE HAVE TO BE AT THINK -- MICHAEL OF THAT -- MY NEXT COMMENT IN QUESTION IS AROUND EQUITY SPECIFICALLY -- MY COLLEAGUE WITH EMPHASIS WILL STEP OUT OF THE ROOM BUT HE TALKED ABOUT ASKING CONSUMERS TO USE LESS THAN ON THE MEN'S SIDE AND I FIND THAT REALLY PROBLEMATIC IN THE DISTRICT WHERE I KNOW MY CONSUMERS ARE ALREADY USING A LOT LESS ON A REGULAR BASIS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO USE MORE THAN WE DO NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONING -- OUT THERE AND SO I FIND I FIND THAT TO BE A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- ABOUT EQUITY OUT THERE WHO'S WEARING THE BROWN AT THE END OF THE DAY THESE COMMUNITIES I WOULD WE HAVE THE CITY THIS MOMENTS OUT THERE WHERE IF I DON'T HAVE A WORKING REFRIGERATOR DEFINITELY LAS IMPACTS ME THAT MUCH MORE IT IS SO MUCH HARDER FOR ME TO REPLACE IT OUT THERE AND SO I JUST WANTED TO BE MINDFUL AND LYFT DO WANT TO REMIND FOLKS USE LEFT AND THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WE COULD DEFINITELY USE LESS I THINK WE NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT THE STATEMENT ON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY OUT THERE IN THIS THING I THINK THEY'RE THINKING OR TALKING ABOUT INVESTING IN WHETHER IT'S HYDRO STORAGE OR BIOMASS WHO'S GOING TO BE PAYING FOR THAT WE HAVE TO I'LL USE THAT HAVE LISTEN THIS CUSTOMERS AND BUT WE STILL HAVE HAD SYSTEMS WILL RELY ON THEM FOR THESE BIG INVESTMENTS ON AND SO HOW ARE WE CREATING A SYSTEM THAT'S MORE EQUITABLE ALL ALONG THE WAY I LIVE IN A DISTRICT WHERE MOST OF MY BOOKS ARE PLUGGED INTO THE I. O. USE AND NOT THAT ALL THESE OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND WE END UP WEARING THE BRIGHT THE BRIGHT WHEN THE COSTS ARE FAR ENOUGH OUT THERE BOARD SOME OF THE LEAST BENEFICIARY FOLKS OUT THERE -- AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING MINDFUL AND EQUITABLE THAT DISCUSSIONS MIGHT DECISIONS AS YOU GUYS ARE PLANNING I HAD TO THIS IS A COMMENT MY LAST QUESTION THOUGH IS ABOUT THE FIFTEEN PERCENT THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING FOR OUR SERVICE WE USUALLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THAT ACTUALLY CLOSER TO TEN PERCENT I IT WE WOULD HAVE TO FIFTEEN PERCENT WE HAVE AVERTED -- THE STUDENTS TO THESE TWO DAYS WELL WE DID HAVE -- FIFTEEN PERCENT -- RESERVE BUT STEVE DO YOU WANNA DIRECTLY AFFECTED SO THE FORECAST ON THOSE DATES ON THEIR TUITION WAS FORTY FORTY FIVE GIGAWATTS ACTUAL LOAD WAS FORTY SEVEN SO IF YOU HAVE THE FULL FIFTEEN PERCENT WE WE WOULD HAVE IN THERE WERE SOME OBVIOUSLY SOME EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I IF I COULD -- WITH YOUR PERMISSION JUST -- RESPOND TO WHEN YOUR EARLIER POINTS WAS UP HERE RIGHT WELL I JUST WANTED TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS BECAUSE EQUITY IS THE FRONT DOOR TO OUR STATE'S CLIMATE POLICY AND EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING I MENTIONED A NUMBER OF THESE ENERGY STORAGE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR THESE NEW CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES IS ARE IN DISADVANTAGED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM WE'RE DOING IN THIS NEW BUILDING DECARBONIZATION EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM -- THAT WAS -- HAD CENTER STERN LET ME KNOW THAT'S EXCLUSIVE GROUP FOR LOW INCOME THIS IS BEEN A BIG FOCUS FOR ALL OF US -- AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK THAT'S A NEW DEVELOPMENT THE LAST FEW YEARS ARE VERY WELCOME ONE I THINK IT'S A MODEL FOR THE FOR THE COUNTRY AND THEN JUST TO THE THE FIRST BORN YOU MAKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE DO THE FORECAST IN AND THIS THIS WHOLE PLANNING US IT'S REALLY BALANCING RELIABILITY WITH THE RATES SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A ONE TO ONE INTO PLANNING RIGHT THAT'S THERE'S A FIFTY PERCENT CHANCE THAT THE ACTUAL DEMAND IS GOING TO BE A OF -- WITH THE FORECAST IF YOU GO TO ONE IN FIVE IT'S A TWENTY PERCENT CHANCE IT'LL BE ABOUT ONE IN TEN OF THE TEN PERCENT IS YOU GET MORE AND MORE SAFETY MARGIN THAT ALSO ADDS MORE COST AND SO THE GOAL I THINK FOR ALL OF US COLLECTIVELY IS TO PROCURE ENOUGH SO WE CAN HAVE A HUNDRED PERCENT CONFIDENCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF THE GRID BUT NOT MORE THAN THAT SO WE CONTAIN COSTS AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE DOWNSIZING ACTOR I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE CAN WE HAVE TO YOU BETTER THAN I MEAN YOUR POINT AND ALL OF YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN -- AND NOBODY REALLY PAYS ANY ATTENTION TO THE STUFF UNTIL WE HAVE A FAILURE LIKE WE DID IN AUGUST FIRST TIME IN TWENTY YEARS AND AND WE HAVE WE GOT TO DO BETTER SO I I JUST POINT OF WHICH ARE HERE YOU AND AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING THAT OBSERVATION YEAH I ALSO IT IF I MIGHT ABOUT THE FIFTY PERCENT PLAYING RESERVE -- -- -- ONE MAKE SURE BODIES ON THE SAME PAGE SO THERE IS A FIFTEEN PERCENT PLANNING RESERVE MARGIN BUT WERE REQUIRED TO KEEP SIX PERCENT RESERVES SO YOU CAN DEDUCT THAT YOU GET TO NINE THEN YOU HAVE OUTAGES ON THE SYSTEM -- WHICH IS ANOTHER FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS SO WHEN YOU HAVE A DEVIATION OFF OF THE FORECAST THE LONGER TERM FORECAST USING A ONE INTO YOUR YOU'RE GONNA YOU'RE RUNNING WAY TOO CLOSE TO THE MARGIN SO -- I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE INCREASE THE MARGINS THAT WE HAVE I CAN GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE I MEAN WE KNOW THE WIND WILL MOVE A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS IN AN HOUR UP AND DOWN THAT'S THE PHYSICS OF IT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO X. DANGER MARGINS FOR SHOCK ABSORBER EVENTS WHETHER THEY BE HEAT OR -- YOU KNOW RENEWABLE MOVEMENTS -- SO -- THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM I ALSO WANNA NOTE LOOKS AT THE PEAK OF THE DAY THE PEAK OF THE DAY YOU CAN SOLVE THAT BY PUTTING MORE OF SOLAR AS AN EXAMPLE BUT IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT -- WHICH IS WHAT I THINK RESOURCE ADEQUACY NEEDS TO REALLY LOOK AT IS THOSE PEAK HOURS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE OUR BLACKOUTS WERE AND WHEN WE HAVE THE TIGHT CONDITIONS ON THE SUBSEQUENT DAYS THAT'S WHERE THE RISK WAS TOO AND WE ASKED PEOPLE YOU MAY RECALL TO CONSERVE FROM THREE TO NINE STROLLER THAT SORT OF FIVE TO NINE WIN WE HAVE HEAVY AIR CONDITIONING LOAD STILL ON THE SYSTEM AND THE SOLAR IS GONE AND I ALSO WANNA NOTE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF BEHIND THE METER SOLAR AS WELL SO WHEN THAT SOLAR GOES THAT LOAD COMES BACK ON THE SYSTEM AND SO YOU CAN SEE THE SWING SO I DO THINK -- AND I I KNOW THAT MY MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE AGREED WE'LL HAVE TO RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND MY SUCCESSOR HAS INDICATED THAT IT'S A SIZE HIS HIGHEST PRIORITY TO YOU KNOW SORT THROUGH THESE ROUTE REACHED RESOURCE ADEQUACY ISSUES AND AT THE UC AND CC RECOGNIZE IT TOO SO WE GOT IF THERE'S MULTIPLE THINGS THAT NEED TO GO ON HERE I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT AND I THINK AS -- PRESENT MATTER INDICATED THERE HAS TO BE SOME PROCUREMENT AND IT HAS TO BE BE QUICK AND WE ARE INDEED IN OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCEEDING LOOKING AT THE MARGIN AND SEEING IF THE FIFTEEN PERCENT IN LIGHT OF WHAT -- WAS JUST STATED IS IS AND AND THE CHANGING THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING AND THE NEW SOME OF THE NEW FORECASTING THAT WE'RE GETTING WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS BALLOTS AND WE DO HAVE TO DO IT NOW AND WE ARE THANK YOU AND -- THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET IT AS WELL AS OUR PLANE HAD ANYTHING THAT'S ON THE SHORT TERM SIDE OF THINGS AS A WILL BE COULD DO NOW FOR A WHILE RETURNING TO BALANCE OUT -- UNFOCUSED I I I JUST WANNA SAY I'VE BEEN HERE FOR EIGHT YEARS I HAVE SEEN THIS DO MORE MORE ON EQUITY BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I FIND IT INADEQUATE AND WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH ALONG THE WAY INCISE WE AS WE ARE DOING THIS WORK I TO SO THAT THAT'S TOP OF MIND FOR ALL OF US AND HOW WE COULD DO IT BETTER WE'VE DONE THINGS LIKE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS LOCAL FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I FIND THAT TO BE INADEQUATE WHEN WE BURN NINETY PERCENT OF THE OF THE BURDEN RIGHT SO WE'VE DONE BUT I'M ALWAYS IN A STATE WITH THE NEXT UP AND HOW DO WE DO BETTER AND SO WE'RE IN A CRISIS AND A CRISIS MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR US TO THINK ABOUT THAT INNOVATION OF HOW DO WE DO BETTER FOR THESE COMMUNITY THINKING WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT THE CRISIS CREATES FOR CHANGES IN CHANGE IN A MUCH MORE EQUITABLE WAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU CEMEX THANK YOU I'M YOU GET TO THIS STAGE IN THE COMMITTEE NEEDS START TO REPEAT WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAS SAID -- BUT I JUST WANTED TO START OFF BY THANKING THE CHAIRMAN FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AT TODAY BECAUSE YOU CAN TELL AMONG ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THIS IS BEEN SOMETHING THAT IS THAT TOP OF MIND AND WE ALL OF OUR PASSION ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE WE ADDRESS THAT I WAS ALSO FASCINATED BY THIS IDEA OF A MORAL ELECTRON -- -- -- YOU KNOW EARLIER IN THE DISCUSSION THE LEGISLATURE JUST BEEN SIX YEARS NOW YOU KNOW I'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF EVOLUTION YEARS -- WHEN I CAME IN TO THE LEGISLATURE I'M NOT SURE THAT I WOULD HAVE -- PRINTOUTS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL TOOK ME A COUPLE YEARS -- AND I WOULD SAY -- AND I SAID THEN CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL I'LL TELL YOU TODAY -- I FIND THAT STATEMENT TO BE RIDICULOUS -- THE REASON I FIND THAT STATEMENT TO BE RIDICULOUS IS IT PRESUMES THAT THERE'S STILL ANY DOUBT THERE ISN'T ANY DOUBT ABOUT IT IN MY COMMUNITY I REPRESENT THE COACHELLA VALLEY -- THERE ARE DAYS THIS YEAR OR THE RECORD HAD BEEN A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DAYS OF TRIPLE DIGIT TEMPERATURES WE'VE BLOWN PAST THAT HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DAYS WERE NORTH OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY DAYS NOW WE AND WE MIGHT END UP WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS AND TWENTY TWENTY WILL READ HAD TRIPLE DIGIT -- TEMPERATURES AND SO WHEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT A MORAL IMPERATIVE THERE IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE KNOWING THAT WE -- HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A CITIZEN CALIFORNIA GLOBAL CITIZENS TO ADDRESS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE THIS GOVERNMENT -- HAS MADE THAT A TOP PRIORITY THAT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE ANY LONGER AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ENERGY SECURITY AND I KNOW WE'VE ALL ADDRESS THAT AS WELL IT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO LIVE IN PALM DESERT WHERE IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DEGREES AND GET A NOTICE THAT YOUR POWER IS GOING TO BE OUT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT EVEN WHEN IT COULD BE EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT IT COULD STILL BE A HUNDRED AND FIVE OR A HUNDRED TEN TO TEN DEGREES AND YOU HAVE SENIOR CITIZENS THAT ARE HOME IN THAT KIND OF TEMPERATURE WITH NO ELECTRICITY AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BACK UP THAT IS ALSO A MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE GOT TO TO ADDRESS SO AGAIN I'VE I VERY MUCH ENJOY HAVE ENJOYED THIS CONVERSATION I THINK WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME THE SAME PAGE WHAT I HAVEN'T YET HEARD BUT I HAVEN'T YET HEARD OF MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVEN'T YET HEARD IS WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO THIS CAN CAN ALL OF YOU GUARANTEE US THAT NEXT YEAR THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN CAN YOU GUARANTEE US THAT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT'S I HAVEN'T YET HEARD ANSWER FOR THAT AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO BRING IT BACK ON US AS A LEGISLATOR THE LEGISLATURE IS DO YOU NEED MORE TOOLS FROM US TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THESE TO MORAL IMPERATIVES TO JUST BEING CONFLICT OR TO COLLIDE WE NEED THEM TO RESOLVE ONE ANOTHER AND SO WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE THAT UNDERSTANDS OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO AND ALSO THE QUESTION OF -- CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT IN THE FUTURE THIS ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN -- FROM THE MANY THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING I WOULD SAY WERE ALL AN ABSOLUTELY DO OUR DAMNDEST TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN THE MANY THINGS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF AN EXPEDITED -- PROCESS AT THE PC SOME OF THE CHANGES WERE PLANNING TO DO MAKE IN TERMS OF OF -- FORECASTING THAT WILL CHANGE SOME OF THE PROCUREMENT THAT WE ORDER AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I SAW HAS TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE MARKET -- REVIEW THAT THEY THEY ARE GOING TO BE UNDERTAKING -- NONE OF US NONE OF US WANTS TO GO THROUGH THIS EVER AGAIN AND WE DO FULLY AGREE WITH YOU WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL NEEDS WE HAVE THIS SENIOR CITIZENS WE HAVE -- PEOPLE IN IN LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT CANNOT ABSORB AND TAKE EVEN IF IT'S A ROLLING ONE SO WE WE DO UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY WE DO FEEL THE URGENCY WE'RE PULLING ON EVERY LEVER WE HAVE I I CAN'T SAY THAT I WILL PLEDGE TO YOU I GUARANTEE THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN I'M GONNA DO MY DAMNDEST TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND SO ON SO EVERY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE CPUC YEAH I WOULD ADD TO THAT THANK YOU SEVEN AND I THINK IT'S A VERY VERY ELOQUENT -- WAITED CAPTURE THOSE TWIN MORAL IMPERATIVES AND I WOULD ADD A THIRD AS WELL AS OUR STATE -- SUFFERS FROM -- THE RECESSION AND REBUILDING THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY INSIDE CLIMATE SOLUTIONS IS HUGE THE NUMBER ONE MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN THE STATE IS ELECTRIC CAR COMPANY IT'S MOST VALUABLE CAR COMING DOWN THE WORLD THERE'S A HUGE UPSIDE AS WE PUSH FORWARD ON THIS OUR STATE ATTRACTS FIFTY THREE PERCENT OF CLEANTECH VENTURE CAPITAL FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY COME HERE -- SUPPORTING ALL THESE TOOLS -- LIKE -- VERY BILL SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA FIGHT LIKE HELL TO ENSURE RELIABLE THAT'S OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL FOR ALL OF US PARTLY BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS THE NEED TO SUPPORT FOR HEALTH AS YOU YOU MENTIONED AND OTHERS -- IT ALSO -- ALL OF THE THESE KIND OF SOLUTIONS FLOWING THROUGH THE ELECTRIC GRID RIGHT NOW AND I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WE'VE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS SIXTY THREE PERCENT CARBON FREE ELECTRICITY ON THE GRID TODAY AND RETAIL SALES WHICH IS YOU KNOW GO BACK IN FIVE TEN YEARS AGO PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAS MYTHOLOGY AND WE'RE DOING IT AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE GROWING THAT EVERY YEAR -- SO THIS IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW OUR NUMBER ONE FOCUS AND AND -- I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS I JUST LIKE TO ADD ELEMENTS OF JUST ADD ONE THOUGHT I I I AGREE I I I APPRECIATE YOUR FORMULATION THE QUESTION AND JUST ONE OBSERVATION I THINK IT'S AS WE AS WE'VE EMBARKED IN CALIFORNIA ON SUCH AN ACTIVE TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE WE NEED TO BE TALKING OPENLY AND HONESTLY AND TRANSPARENTLY ABOUT OURS OUR POWER SYSTEM MORE REGULARLY MORE FREQUENTLY NOT JUST WHEN THINGS GO BAD WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE N. AT THE C. P. C. N. C. C. HAVE PROFOUND RESPONSIBILITIES TO HELP NAVIGATE THIS TRANSITION BUT EVERY CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA WILL PLAY A ROLE IN THIS TRANSITION AND AN INCREASING AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF OTHER ELECTRICITY DEMAND WHAT INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS WHAT INDIVIDUAL TECHNOLOGIES THE BATTERY IN YOUR BASEMENT THE RENEWABLE BUT SOLAR PANELS ON YOUR ROOF ALL OF THESE RESOURCES CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THE SOLUTION AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET INTEGRATED INTO THE GREAT AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND AND UNDERSTAND THOSE CHOICES SO I I AND I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE OPENLY AND REGULARLY SO THAT WE CAN REPORT ON THE PROGRESS IN THE AREAS WHERE WE ARE ACCELERATING INTO CONTINUE TO VERY TRANSPARENTLY IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE WE HAVE UP TILL CHALLENGES WHERE WE ALL REALLY NEED TO LEAN IN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS THOSE MORAL IMPERATIVES AND AND LOOK FOR DEBT FOR THE DIALOGUE -- IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD THANK YOU SURE PETRIE-NORRIS HI THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND SO I CHAIRED THE ASSEMBLY'S ACCOUNTABILITY IN A MINUTE TO REVIEW COMMITTEE I DON'T SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN YOU AND THIS IS NOT A YOU KNOW AN AREA OF DEEP POLICY EXPERTISE FOR ME THIS I KNOW I CAN APPROACH THIS HEARING IN THIS CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S KIND OF A NORMAL CALIFORNIA AND I'LL SAY IT MOST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THEY DON'T SPEND VERY MUCH TIME THINKING ABOUT STATE GOVERNMENT RIGHT THEY ARE TOO BUSY FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET TO WORK YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THEIR BILLS I'M BUT THEY CERTAINLY EXPECT US TO KEEP THEIR LIGHTS ON SO JUST PICKING UP ON THE THREAD FIVE OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER MAYES HAS RAISED I WAS LIKE MY HEART KIND OF STOPPED WHEN HE SAID CAN YOU ASSURE US THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT SUMMER AND NOBODY SAID YES EVERYONE SAID WE'RE GOING TO WORK LIKE HELL WE'RE GONNA DO OUR BEST AND LIKE WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE THAT ANSWER YES BECAUSE THIS IS TWENTY TWENTY THIS IS CALIFORNIA WHERE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE ARE NO I CAPITAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION IF WE CAN'T SAY IF WE CAN UNEQUIVOCALLY SAY YES WE'RE KEEPING YOUR LIGHTS ON NEXT SUMMER I MEAN I'M PRETTY FOR FIVE YEARS SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE THAT UNDER PERCENT YES WELL LET ME LET ME LET ME TAKE ANOTHER SWING AND TRYING CORRECT MYSELF BECAUSE WHAT I I SAID AS I AM OF FREIGHT I TO TAKE AN ABSOLUTE PLEDGE WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE KIND OF DAYS IN AUGUST THAT WE JUST TEN OF THE MANY THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT WE ALL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WE ARE DOING ALL OF THEM I DO THINK THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY KEEP THE LIGHTS ON NEXT SUMMER OKAY THAT'S THAT'S GOOD THAT'S REASSURING I'M BACK TO ANYTHING SAID THAT THE THREAD IT'S KIND OF OLD IT WASN'T A THREAT IT WAS KIND OF THAT THE CORE OF THE TESTIMONY BECAUSE OF THE CORE OF THE ANALYSIS HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS AS A ONE IN THIRTY FIVE YEAR HE DIFFERENT RIGHT I'M BUT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THAT PEAK DEMAND WAS BELOW WHAT WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND SIX SO I'M GIVEN THE REASSURANCES THAT THAT YOU'VE MADE THAT IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF RENEWABLES WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT ISN'T WORKING AS WELL AS IT DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THAT'S MY QUESTION -- I CAN I CAN TAKE US ARE YOU READY FOR THAT ANSWERED YOU HAVE THAT YES OKAY I CAN TAKE SYSTEM WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THAN IT IS TODAY -- OBVIOUSLY THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT BUT THERE IS FAR MORE CAPACITY ON THE SYSTEM THEN AND FURTHERMORE WE HAD -- AS I INDICATED EARLIER WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR NOW SO IF YOU WERE TO COMPARE THE LOAD IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WHICH WAS FIFTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ROUGHLY -- WITH WHAT WE HAD RECENTLY YOU HAVE TO NORMALIZE IT WOULD BE A FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF LOAD IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX SO IF YOU KIND OF COMPARE APPLES AND APPLES IT WAS IT'S A COMPARABLE LOADED -- THAT WE HAD -- THIS YEAR AS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND WHEN YOU WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINK IT'S A ONE THIRTY FIVE WE JUST THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE ONE AND THIRTY FIVES AND I THINK THAT'S GOT TO BE PART OF THE PLANNING GOING FORWARD THAT THIS THIS HE NEEDS AND THIS CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE YOU KNOW IS UPON US AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE WON IN THIRTY FIVE ANYMORE IT COULD BE THE ONE IN FIVE NOW IT COULD BE A ONE AND TWO NOW -- AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PLAN FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT'S HOW WE GET CLOSE TO MAKING SURE WE CAN ASSURE RELIABILITY OKAY SIR AB BUT WHAT WHAT CHANGED IN CAN OF THE MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEES VERSUS TWO THOUSAND AND SIX IN TERMS OF THE FACT WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND WE WE WEREN'T IN AUGUST ACTUALLY THERE WERE THERE WERE TWO THINGS I WOULD POINT TO THAT WE HAD DIFFERENT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND WE HAVE NOW ONE AS I INDICATED WE HAD FAR MORE PASS ME ON THE SYSTEM WE HAD -- THE SENATE NO FREE NUCLEAR PLANT WHICH IS IN TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS RIGHT THERE -- THEN AND WE HAD -- PROBABLY SEVERAL THOUSAND NOT PROBABLY WE DID HAVE SEVERAL THOUSAND MORE MEGAWATTS OF GAS PLANTS THAN -- THAN WE DO NOW SO THE RISK PASSED THE DIFFERENCE THE SECOND ELEMENT IS -- THIS AN ELEMENT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA HEAVILY RELIES ON IMPORTS INTO THE STATE TO MEET ITS NEEDS AND IT'S BEEN CLEAR TO US THAT THAT -- RELIANCE ON IMPORTS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO RETHINK BECAUSE THE OTHER AREAS ARE FACED WITH THE SAME CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE HERE BOTH IN TERMS OF LOAD -- AND OTHER CHANGES TO THEIR SYSTEM SO THE THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF RESOURCE RETIREMENTS ACROSS THE WEST WE IMPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT FIGURES BUT IF I HAD TO TAKE A STAB AT IT WE IMPORTED ON THE ORDER OF TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF POWER -- OVER THIS HEAT WAVE WE ARE THE THE TOP WE HAD WAS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATT SO ABOUT HALF OF WHAT WE HAD TO BE IMPORTED SO BETWEEN CAPACITY ON THE SYSTEM AND IMPORTS -- THAT COUNTS FOR A LOT OF THE DIFFERENCE GOT IT OKAY AND THEN LAST QUESTION SUIT CAN YOU JUST WALK US THROUGH YOUR ATKINS ESCALATION PROCESS SEES SO -- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHO RAISES THE ALARM AND SAYS MY GOSH WHAT WERE ABOUT TO BE OUT OF POWER BECAUSE I THINK ONE THING THAT WAS VERY SURPRISING IS IT FELT LIKE WE WERE ALL REALLY TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY THIS IT WAS I THINK IS THE CHAIR SAID WE RECEIVED A KIND OF A TWELVE HOURS NOTICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO CAN YOU TALK US THROUGH WHAT ARE KIND OF THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS AND ESCALATION PROCEDURES FIVE WHEN THE SORT OF THING OCCURS ALL BUT I'LL TAKE THAT TOO AND -- AS AN INSTITUTION -- WILL OWN THAT THAT WE SHOULD OF RAISE THE ALARM -- -- FASTER BUT -- ALL JUST HAVE TO GIVE YOU SOME OF MY OWN PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS ON THIS WE ARE OFFERING VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGE AND I THINK WE HAVE A CONTROL ROOM -- WHERE THE OPERATORS OPERATE THE GRID AND I'VE BEEN DOWN THERE ON A NUMBER OF CASES AND TIMES WHERE THEY SAID IT'S GOING TO BE TIGHT OVER THE PEAK OF HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THOSE GREAT OPERATORS FIFTY TIMES IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT OVER THE P. WE KNEW GOING ON THE FOURTEENTH THAT WAS GOING TO BE TIGHT WHAT WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND AND WE UNDERESTIMATED IS HOW MUCH THE PARTICULARLY THE IMPORTANCE WORDS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THE HEAT WAVE WE HAD WAS A WEST WIDE HEAT WAVE IT WAS BRUTAL EVERYWHERE IN THE WEST SO WE UNDERESTIMATED THE THE LIMITED ACCESS OF IMPORTS THAT WE HAD AND -- WE WILL BE -- VIGILANT AND WE KNOW THAT THAT ISN'T THE SITUATION AND I THINK WE CORRECTED OURSELVES OVER LABOR DAY WEEKEND WE WE TOLD PEOPLE VERY EARLY THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE GONNA BE TIGHT I WILL NOTE THAT WE DID -- ISSUE A FLEXIBLE OR ON THURSDAY THE THIRTEENTH AND RESTRICTED MAINTENANCE INTO THAT NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU KNOW THE POPULACE OF THE STATE KNOWS THAT THERE'S A RESTRICTED MAINTENANCE THEY SHOULD KNOW THERE'S A FLEX ALERT HERE TO AFTER UP TO A COUPLE YEARS AGO THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT -- ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN TO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT FLEX ALERTS AND HOW THEY WORKED AND THAT FELL BY THE WAYSIDE IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IS MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CITIZEN IN THE STATE IS A WHERE WHEN WE HAVE TIGHT CONDITION SO WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO RETHINK HOW THE SPLIT SOLAR PROCESS WORKS AND IT'S A LEARNING FOR US AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL BE TOP OF MIND GOT AN ACCESS ONE MORE QUESTION BECAUSE THE AND SOME ARTICLES THAT I'VE READ THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE OBSERVERS INCLUDING I THINK A FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE P. C. HO SPECULATED THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE SAME MARKET MANIPULATION OF POTENTIALLY HAPPENING AS WE DID IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS LIKE YOU THINK THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE BUT CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO SPEAK TO THAT CONCERN I CAN ALSO DO THAT WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF MANIPULATION DURING THESE PERIODS -- AND I KNOW THAT A FORMER UC -- PRESIDENT SPECULATE ON THAT WITH FRANKLY NO BASIS AND I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHERE THE BASIS CAME FROM -- BOTH OR WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT AN INDEPENDENT -- DEPARTMENT OF MARKET MONITORING THEY LOOKED INTO THIS THEY AGREE WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN -- WE'RE GONNA PUT OUR GUARDS DOWN WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT AND WE DO NOT SEE ANYTHING AND FURTHERMORE THE OUTAGE RATES ON THOSE DAYS OF -- GENERATORS WAS PROBABLY BELOW NORMAL SO WE DIDN'T SEE WITHHOLDING OR OTHER MANIPULATION SO -- THAT'S THAT'S RESPONSE TO THE GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER QUITE CUNNINGHAM FEMINIST BURKE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AMANDA I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST ACTUALLY OUR SITUATION WITH CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID IT'S A LOT WORSE AND WE'RE CONTEMPLATING TODAY WE ARE SEEING THE RETIREMENT ASSETS WHETHER THEY BE NATURAL GAS OR THE IMPENDING DECOMMISSIONING OF THE DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR POWER PLANT JAPANESE TO BE IN MY DISTRICT WHICH PRODUCES NINE PERCENT ROUGHLY THE STATE'S ENERGY CARBON FREE IN MY OPINION THAT'S A FOOLISH DECISION BUT IT'S BEEN MADE AND WE'RE ADAPTING TO IT THE QUESTION IS ARE WE PLANNING FOR IT I THINK THE ANSWER'S NO WE HAVE NO PLAN REALLY WE'VE WRITTEN IN THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE GOALS -- DECARBONIZING OUR ELECTRICITY GRIDS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE FOR CONSTITUENTS BUT YOU NEED A PLAN TO TO TO EXECUTE THAT YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REPLACE THE RETIRED ASSETS REPLACE DOUBLE CANYON'S POWER THE FUTURE IS ALSO GONNA INVOLVE A LOT MORE DEMAND ON OUR ELECTRICITY GRID WE'RE BUILDING MORE HOUSING THAT'S MORE AC UNITS MORE LECTERNS IT'S GETTING HOTTER EVERY YEAR A LOT HOTTER THAT'S MORE AC MORE ELECTRONS WE'RE GOING TO CLOUD COMPUTING FIVE G.

HAS THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS IN PLACE SOME OF THEM ARE SIXTY MILES OFFSHORE WHERE THEY CAN'T BE SEEN -- THE ENTIRE IS GOING TO A TWELVE MEGAWATT PLATFORM ON LAND IN CALIFORNIA LET'S SEE SEE YOU KNOW ONE HALF TO TWO MEGAWATTS OF THE THE SCALE FOR THE RESOURCE THE WIND RESOURCE IS SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER OFF SHORE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S APPROACHING SIXTY PERCENT CAPACITY FACTORS OF THE TURBINES ARE SPENDING SIXTY PERCENT THE HOURS OF THE DAY IN WAYS THAT COMPLEMENT SOLAR BEAUTIFULLY THERE UP IN THE MORNING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND THEN THEY GO UP IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING -- AS COMPARED TO WIND ON LANDS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT CAPACITY FACTOR SO WE'RE WORKING ON THAT WE DO NEED TO BE ABLE TO COOPERATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THIS AND -- THAT'S THAT HAS BEEN A AN ONGOING -- CHALLENGE BUT I'M HOPEFUL -- WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME REAL PROGRESS ON THAT IN THE YEARS AT AND I AGREE VERY MUCH WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE NEED FOR LAND AND HOW IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO COURT COORDINATOR AND WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON A DEPARTMENT OF NAVY IN PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE OFFER OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE ALONG THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA MISTER AT FIRST I CAN HEAR ME FIRST I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT BACK I WILL AGREE THAT AS YOU'VE BEEN THERE I HAVE SEEN THINGS START TO MOVE BETTER AND YOU'VE BEEN ACCESSIBLE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT OF COURSE BEFORE I MAKE MY NEXT SET OF THINK THERE'S A GENERAL FUND OPERATION WITH THIS KIND OF TERM EXTREME WEATHER EVENT AND I HEAR YOU SAYING YOU KNOW WE ACCEPT THAT THERE'S GLOBAL WARMING AND ALL OF THESE THINGS BUT I THINK THAT A SINGLE ONE IT'S A ONE IN THIRTY FIVE YEAR EVENT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT ONE THIRTY FIVE IS NOW ONE IN FIVE OR ONE INTO HOWEVER I FEAR HOW YOU'VE BEEN PLANNING AND IT'S EVERY TWO EVEN PLANNING BASED ON EVERY TWO YEARS AND I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT THAT IT'S NOT GONNA WORK ANYMORE AND THAT THE FACT THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS GLOBAL AND LIKE THAT WAS JUST SAID THAT WE HAD A WEST COAST EVENT OBVIOUSLY THAT OCCURRED AND WE LOST IN THE FIGHT FOR ELECTRONS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOSS BECAUSE WE HAVE RELIED ON THE IMPORT OF THAT YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN RESPECT OUR GOALS I RESPECT WE CAN BE THOUGHT FOR THE TRANSITION I JUST I'M NOT SURE THAT WE BEEN HONEST OF WHAT THAT TRANSITION ACTUALLY NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE AND I WILL SAY THAT THAT IS PARTLY NOT JUST I THINK WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF IT ON YOU AND CAL I STILL BUT I DO THINK IT'S PART THE LEGISLATURE FOR POSSIBILITY AS WELL AND IN SAYING THAT I I JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE HAVE BEEN HONEST WITH SOME OF OUR ENVIRONMENTALISTS PARTNERS I THINK WE'VE TOLD THEM THAT WE HAVE THESE LOFTY GOALS AND I THINK WE CAN REACH AND I THINK WE CAN BE A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN HERE AND THERE AND I KEEP HEARING A LOT OF WORDS AND I THINK LIKE MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED LIKE PLANNING AND IN THE FUTURE TECHNOLOGY AND WE ARE PLANNING FOR THESE THINGS BUT IF WE HAD AN ANOTHER EVENT TOMORROW FOR THE NEXT WEEK WE WOULD FAIL AGAIN AND I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD HOW WE WOULDN'T FAIL AGAIN SO I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS AS SOMEONE WHO'S WILLING TO TAKE AND TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY WITH MY COLLEAGUES IS ACCEPTING THAT PART OF THIS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY ONE IS IN YOUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY PLANS THAT YOU ARE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS WERE BECAUSE PEAK IS NOT THE SAME I MEAN I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES WHERE IT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK IT'S THE HOTTEST OF DOUBT THAT I WORK IN SACRAMENTO I'VE LEARNED THAT FOUR O'CLOCK IT'S A HUNDRED AND FOUR DEGREES OUTSIDE IN MY LA HOME I DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING I DON'T NEED IT UP HERE CENTRAL VALLEY ALL THIS AND I'VE WORN THESE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE AND I'M CURIOUS I KNOW YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTING THAT RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCESS AND PLAN IN THE MARGINS MY QUESTION FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE ONE DO WE NEED TO LEGISLATE TO PUT A DEADLINE ON THAT PROCESS IS THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SWORE THAT THAT IS DONE IN A TIMELY FASHION I KNOW YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF IT BUT I'M CURIOUS IS THAT NECESSARY AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS BATTERY STORAGE OBVIOUSLY LITHIUM BATTERIES AREN'T LONG ENOUGH OBVIOUSLY WE NEED SEASONAL STORAGE BUT THAT IS NOT INTO TALLADEGA NOT IN THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS IS THAT A TOTAL PLAN I THINK WE'VE ALL AGREED -- WE ALL UNDERSTAND NOW THE BATTERY STORAGE ISN'T THE GOLDEN EGG THAT WE HAD HOPED IT WAS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW WHERE DO MICRO GRADES FALL INTO THAT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF PROCEEDING DO WE NEED TO LEGISLATORS TO WIN THAT OR WE ALREADY HAVE LEGISLATORS TO WIN AT THAT PROCEEDING SHOULD BE DONE I APPRECIATE AGAIN PRESIDENT BADGER THAT THAT HAS MOVED FASTER SINCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE BUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THESE THINGS AS A LEGISLATURE HOW DO WE WILL LINE COMMUNICATE HONESTLY WHAT THE TRANSITION REALLY DOES GONNA IS GONNA LOOK LIKE AND WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO PEOPLE AND TO GIVE YOU THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS GREAT TRANSITION TO THIS CARBON FREE ENVIRONMENT AND TO DOES IT HELP YOU OR DO WE NEED TO LEGISLATE ON WHAT THOSE DEADLINE LOOK LIKE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE RECEIVED BECAUSE TO ME I WILL SAY I WAS NOT SURPRISED AT WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE CAO AYE SO CAME TO ME A YEAR AGO AND SAID THIS IS ON IT'S ON THE HORIZON SO I KNOW I'M PRETTY LOW ON THE TOTEM POLE IF I IF SOMEONE CAME TO ME THEY CAME TO EVERYBODY ELSE LONG BEFORE THEY CAME TO ME SO I FIND IT FRUSTRATING THAT WE HIT THAT WE HIT THAT FEW DAYS BECAUSE IF I KNEW IT WAS ON THE HORIZON EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM INCLUDING YOU GUYS KNEW AND WERE ALL RESPONSIBLE I'M WILLING TO TAKE ON PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE -- WE ARE WE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE AND WE TAKE THAT FULLY I NEED TIME FRAMES WE ARE OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY NOT WHAT THE DECISION IS ON GOING OUR OUR ON EXPEDITED -- PROCEEDING RESEARCH ADVOCACY DECISIONS THIS THIS PHASE THIS ROUND WILL BE DONE IN BY JUNE AND ON IT REAL QUICK SO WILL THAT INCLUDE THE TRADITIONAL PEAKER THAT WILL INCLUDE AN EXTENDED NO WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE NEXT WEEK -- THAT -- CALISTO IS A HAS -- WELL TODAY YES GOSH I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT WHAT MY SECOND POINT IS -- YOUR SECOND QUESTION I'M SORRY REYES WERE PART OF THE OVERALL PICTURE WHAT NEEDED TO HOW DO WE NEED TO LEGISLATIVE OR WE'VE ALREADY LEGISLATED ON WHEN THAT SHOULD BE DONE BUT WHAT IS NOT LOOKING LIKE ARE WE WE WE -- EXPEDITED THAT PROCEEDING -- MY FELLOW COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER SURE ROMA STARTED PHASE -- ONE OF THAT AND WE SCULPTED ACTUALLY IN DECEMBER AND IT WAS FINALIZED IN JUNE -- FOR THIS YEAR FOR THIS COMING YEAR AND SHE IS NOW UNDERTAKING PHASE TWO WHICH WILL BE FINALIZED ME BEFORE -- THE END OF THE YEAR BY DECEMBER ON MICHAEL IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US THE PHASE ONE OF THE MICROGRID WAS FOR THIS COMING IT PERIOD OF TIME SOME OF THE MIX WHICH WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WAS FRANKLY DIESEL THAT WAS PUT INTO THE MY COULD GET THAT WHERE WERE -- WORKING HARD WITH THE LSE'S AND OTHERS TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS REPLACED BY -- CLEAN ENERGY AND -- IT WAS A TIME FACTOR UNFORTUNATELY THIS YEAR BUT THOSE BOTH THOSE PROCEEDINGS WERE EXPEDITED DONE WITHIN A SIX MONTH PERIOD AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO TO COMPLETION RIGHT YES YES -- AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THESE RESOURCES COMING ONLINE -- I IT THOSE SEEM LIKE ENOUGH FOR NEXT YEAR I JUST WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW I KNOW YOU SAID THAT THERE'S PLANNING TO GO TO TWO AND FIVE YEARS TWO AND FIVE YEAR OUT BUT THAT WAS BASED ON I BELIEVE WITH THE JOHN THE MINISTER SAID WAS A ON THIS TRADITION OF OF REVIEWING THE LAST TWO YEARS SO LOOKING FORWARD IS THERE A TOTALITY THE TOTALITARIAN SOMEWHERE LOOK AT ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE THE CARS COMING ONLINE THAT WE HAVE THESE LARGE OBVIOUSLY WILL EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WHICH I THINK ARE JUST NEW WHETHER NEW SUMMERS EARLIER LONGER SUMMERS LOOK LIKE HOW DOES THAT PROCESS WHAT DOES THAT PROCESS LOOK LIKE DIFFERENT THAN IT WILL LOOK LIKE BEFORE THAT PLANNING PROCESS BECAUSE I'M LISTENING TO WHAT THE GENTLEMAN SAID AND SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE CONTINUING TO DO WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING IN THE FORECASTING YES -- DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT DAY YES SO WHEN WE WE DO THE WE DO A ONE INTO FORECAST ONE OF FIVE FORECAST ONE TEN FOR THOSE ARE ALREADY ON GOING THAT THE CHOICE WHICH TO USE IS NOT IS NOT ARE WE I THINK THAT THE THE -- YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW THE EVENTS THAT USED TO BE ONE THIRTY FIVE THAT ARE MORE FREQUENT I THINK THAT'S YOUR ALL CALIBER THAT BUT WE'RE ALSO -- STEVEN WONDER IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE HIGH ELECTRIFICATION FORECAST BECAUSE WE ARE WE HAVE A SCENARIO WE RUN WHERE WE'RE YOU KNOW WHICH INCLUDES ALL OF THE THINGS AS SOMEONE CUNNINGHAM WAS MENTIONING INCLUDING RECTOR KEUCHEL'S SILVA COULD YOU JUST COMMENT ON THAT YEAH -- THANK YOU CHAIR -- THE -- SPECIFIC IN THAT THE -- CHICO SHIELD IS TALKING ABOUT IS AND THE THIRD PLANNING HORIZON WE HAVE WHICH IS THE SB ONE HUNDRED WHICH IS THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE AGENCIES ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON -- INCLUDING THAT EIGHT RESOURCES BOARD I'M TO THE DEMAND SCENARIOS THAT WE CURRENTLY -- USE TO PLAN THE GOOD FOR TWENTY FORTY FIVE I JUST CALLED THE HIGH ELECTRIFICATION SCENARIO AND WITHIN THAT SCENARIO A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES WILL BE ELECTRIC BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THAT WAS PRIOR TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS SIGNED I'M SO SO THAT'S KIND OF IN LINE WITH -- WITH WHAT SOME OF THE AT THE GUINNESS AND IN THAT PROJECTION IS A PROJECTING -- AS IF WE ALL GO BACK TO LIKE I I'LL HOW DO YOU PROJECT FOR LIKE ALL THESE LIFE CHANGES RIGHT LIKE NOW WE HAVE COLLUDED WILL STAY AT HOME I ASSUME THAT HAS SOME ISSUE SOME BALANCE ON WHY WE LOST ELECTRICITY EVERYONE'S IN THEIR HOUSE AND IT YOU KNOW WITH THEIR CONDITIONING ON ON THEIR OFFICE BUILDINGS HOW DID THOSE PROJECTIONS WORK FOR THAN FOR A AND ARE THERE TO LEVELS OF PROJECTIONS ONE FOUR IF WORKING LIFE IS CHANGING PEOPLE ARE CHARGING ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT HOME VERSUS IF THERE AND YOU KNOW HAVING TO CHARGE AN OFFICER OR AT DIFFERENT TIMES A DAY AS OPPOSED TO BEING WHERE WE USED TO ALL BE IN THE OFFICE DURING THE DAY ALL DAY LONG NOW MAYBE THAT MOVING ALONG JUST AS P. BECAUSE CHANGED HOW DO YOU ADJUST FOR THE PEAK CHANGING ON WHAT THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE AND THEN I HAVE A RELEASED RANDOM STUPID QUESTION BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DID AT ONE POINT SINCE I HAVE YOU I'M AS A MASCOT -- I DID THINK ABOUT BUYING ELECTRIC CAR NOT TOO LONG AGO AND THEN THESE POWER OUTAGES WHEN OUT SO WHAT HAPPENS TO ME OF MY ELECTRIC CAR AND THE POWER GOES OUT FOR TWO DAYS WHAT WHAT WAS MY CAR I DON'T CHARGE MY CAR I GOT A BICYCLE SO I BELIEVE I CAN RESPOND THAT THE NAVY SILVA WOULD YOU RESPOND HER FIRST QUESTION FIRST AND I'LL TAKE THAT SECOND YEAH ABSOLUTELY -- I THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS I THINK THOSE ARE -- REALLY INSIGHTFUL QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY ON THE IMPACT OF THAT COLLUDED CHIPS SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I I KIND OF PUT THIS OUT THERE IN TERMS OF HOW WE DO A DIFFERENT KIND OF THAT TIME HORIZON SO WE HAVE T. TIME HORIZONS THAT WE PLANNED FOR SO ONE IS THAT HE TO HAD A TIME HORIZON WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY USED FOR THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCESS AND WE WE HAVE A TEN YEAR TIME FRAME WHICH IS USED FOR THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING AND THE IRP PROCESS SEES AND THEN WE HAVE THE TWENTY FIVE HORIZON PLANNING WHICH IS THE SB ONE HUNDRED PLANNING SO ALL THREE OF THEM HAVE TO BEGIN TO HARMONIZE I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT MOVING FORWARD EACH OF THEM THAT THINGS ARE CHANGING VERY RAPIDLY BOTH ON THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND SIDE IN TERMS OF ELECTRIFICATION THE TYPE OF LOS INSURED OBSERVING SO THAT THE HARMONIZATION OF THOSE THE HORIZONS IS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I I THINK IT'S VERY WELL OBSERVED AS FAR AS -- THE SPECIFIC -- LOW CHIPS ARE CONCERNED IN TERMS OF COLLUDED RPGS WE -- HAVE -- THAT I AM THE DATA AT THE INTERVAL METER DATA THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING INTO A CC -- IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO -- WE'VE PASSED AND THE DATA REGULATIONS LAST YEAR WE WE GET THE TOP FIVE -- CALYCES AND METER DATA AND THAT NEITHER DATA WILL BE USED TO UNDERSTAND THE CHANGING PATTERNS AND THE LOAD SHAPES AND AND THOSE WILL BE USED AT THE TWO ACTIVE MERGED WITH THE DEMAND FORECAST TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE LOTUS CHANGING AN EIGHTY SEVEN SIXTY LEVEL THAT EXACT -- TO SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE HERE REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO -- TAKE IT OUT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF HISTORY ARE WE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FIVE SIX MONTHS AND WE GET A PLANE BAKED INTO THE FORECAST -- THAT THAT'S GONNA THAT TO ME MEETING WITH ENGINEERED A SURGE OF POWER AND THEN ONE LAST QUESTION SUPPORT I JUST NEED TO RECORD YOUR QUESTION ABOUT -- CHARGE WHICH IS I'VE BEEN DRIVING LIKE TO COVER THREE AND HALF YEARS IN CALIFORNIA GOT A LOT I'VE NEVER ONCE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE BECAUSE AGREED HOURS ARE JUST YOU KNOW POINT OUT WE ARE HERE TODAY TALKING ABOUT -- ALL THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN AUGUST BUT THAT WAS TWO AND A HALF HOURS ON THE FOURTEENTH AN HOUR AND A HALF ON THE FIFTEENTH AND WE'RE -- YOU KNOW GENERALLY SPEAKING IN THE GRID BE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND HAVE ALL THESE COMPANIES COME LOOK AT HERE IF THAT WERE THE CASE THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REDUNDANCIES BEING POLLUTED BY NUMBER THE V. CHARGING COMPANIES INCLUDING ONSITE STORAGE -- AND AND SOLAR ONSITE WHICH YOU'RE SEEING WE'VE ACTUALLY -- SOME COPIES OF THE STANDALONE SOLAR BATTERY STORAGE CHARGING STATIONS THAT THE NEW COMPANY THAT'S BEEN BUILT AND SO THAT ADDITIONAL REDUNDANCIES IS -- GOING TO PLACES WELL IN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I YOU MOSTLY MEET SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE HAD TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT I HAVE FAMILY I HAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAD TO WIN THREE TWO DAYS WITHOUT POWER WHO HAD ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHO ARE OLDER AND I I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT I DID A BILL ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO OR WE TRY TO PUT CHARGING WHERE WE PUT CHARGING STATIONS SIGN PUT CHARGING STATE ASK FOR CERTAIN STATIONS IN AT PARKS AND SCHOOL WE TRY TO GET SCHOOLS COULDN'T GET SCHOOLS PARKS AND BEACHES AND THOSE START THERE SO THOSE REDUNDANCIES AREN'T THERE YET IN ALL DUE RESPECT AND THESE ARE OLDER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE AN ELECTRIC CAR WHO HAD NO POWER FOR TWO DAYS SO THAT MAYBE YOUR REALITY AND I'LL TELL YOU FOR SURE IF I WAS IN MY COMMUNITY BY WERE IN MY COMMUNITY THE REALITY IS THERE WOULD BE NO REDUNDANCIES NOT AT LEAST FOR AN HOUR AWAY AND AS A MEMBER WHO'S BEEN DRIVING BACK AND FORTH THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM LA TO SACRAMENTO BECAUSE OF KOBE I HAVE LEARNED THAT THINGS CHANGE AND THINGS ARE DRASTIC AND DIFFERENT NOW THAN THEY HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS SO THAT'S JUST WITH ALL DUE RESPECT AND THEN JUST ONE MORE QUESTION -- SO FOR YOUR PLANNING PROCESS HE'S I'M JUST CURIOUS IS THERE ANYWAY RESOURCE ADEQUACY KIND OF NEW FORMULATION OF WHAT THAT'S GOING THAT PROGRAM A LOOK LIKE DO WE NEED TO CREATE SOME FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHAT PEAK IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST AYE IT SOUNDS LIKE PEOPLE IT JUST DEPENDING ON WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AND IN LIFE AND INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD EVERY TIME TO LOOK AT THAT PROGRAM IS THERE A WAY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT USED TO BE IN THE MAIL TODAY THAT PEAK IS NOW THREE TO NINE OR WHATEVER IT IS AND THEN NOT ME I JUST EXPAND OR WHATEVER IS THERE IS THAT ON THE HORIZON IN THAT PROGRAM GOING TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THAT PROGRAM THAT'S MY LAST QUESTION I'M AYE I THINK IF I MAY I THINK THAT THE NET PEAK IS FAIRLY DEFINED AT THIS TIME I DON'T KNOW OTHER THAN ON THE MARGINS WHERE THINGS WILL ADJUST -- DEFINITELY CODED AS YOU OF REMARKED AND CHANGED SOME OF THE USAGE AND TIME OF USAGE AND DEMAND UN WHERE SOME OF THE LARGE COMMERCIAL WENT DOWN HIGHER AND HIGHER DEMAND WHAT HAPPENED SOME OF THE RESIDENTIAL TIMES PLACES AND TIME PERIODS -- BUT THE THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY AYE AYE AYE WE HAVE WE HAVE FLEXIBILITY AND WE WE HOW WE MANAGE OUR PROCEEDING IS IS THAT AND AND WE CAN OBVIOUSLY BE CRITICIZED AND HAVE BEEN AND WE CAN CORRECT -- BUT I I THINK WE HAVE THE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE WE NEED AND WE CERTAINLY AND IN WITH OUR SISTER EIGHT WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES -- WITH THE ADJUSTING THAT WILL BE DONE WHEN FORECASTING SOME OF THE MARKET -- REVIEW THAT WILL TAKE PLACE I THINK WE WILL HAVE A A MUCH BETTER -- OVERALL VIEW AND UNDERSTANDING I THINK SIVA JUST MENTIONED -- THAT WE WILL BE GETTING THE METER DATA INFORMATION SOON THAT WILL TELL US EXACTLY -- WHAT OCCURRED WITH DEMAND RESPONSE THAT WILL BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT RESOURCES DID SHOW UP -- UNDER THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM WHO WHO BID IN AND WHO DIDN'T THOSE ARE THINGS THAT AS YOU KNOW THIS WAS THERE ARE IN INTERMENT PORCH TO THE GOVERNOR WE HAVE A FINAL REPORT THAT WILL DO THAT WILL HAVE MUCH MORE DATA AND AND FURTHER ANALYSIS THAT WILL EACH ONE OF US AND COLLECTIVELY WE WILL WE WILL BE DOING THANK YOU SOMERS THIRTY I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM INGLEWOOD'S A QUESTION ABOUT THE ELECTRIC CAR YOU KNOW MY MY WIFE JUST RECENTLY -- STARTED LEASING BUT I KEEP MY TWENTY YEAR OLD TOYOTA GAS CAR BECAUSE YOU KNOW I I HAD SOME OF THE SAME QUESTIONS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN THE ELECTRICITY GOES OUT IT AND SO I I I THINK YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT THERE BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE ARE GOING TO STOP SELLING -- GAS POWERED CARS A GOES TO -- MR CUNNINGHAM'S COMMENT ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW THAT'S GONNA BRING ON THAT WHOLE NEW -- CHARGING GRADE AND SO I I THINK I I SUSPECT THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE LAST QUESTIONS BUT -- QUESTIONERS BUT -- I WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO YOU KNOW A THEME THAT I HEARD MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT THE SENSE OF URGENCY THEY WERE FEELING YOU KNOW WHAT THE WILD FIRES IT WITH THE AIR POLLUTION THAT CAME FROM THE WILDFIRES THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW HAS HAD THE IMPACT ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE OUR OUR CHILDREN IN OUR ELDERLY SO -- YOU KNOW ALONG THE LINES OF A OF A -- FEELING THAT THE SENSE OF URGENCY I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH THE -- I I CLIMB FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE CLEAN POWER ALLIANCE IS NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST LOAD SERVING ENTITY IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE IS SOME -- SOME COMMENTS AND CONCERNS THAT WERE WITH ME IN PREPARATION FOR TODAY'S HEARING ONE OF THEM IS THAT -- YOUR REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT -- WE INSURE THAT THEY GENERATION AND STORAGE PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION ARE COMPLETED BY THEIR TARGETED ONLINE DATES BUT THEY'RE EMPHASIZING THAT -- -- THAT MANY LSE'S -- ARE -- READY AND DEVELOPMENT FOR PROJECTS BEYOND THOSE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE RAISING THE CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE AGENCIES WILL WORK TO GET PROJECTS MOVING FASTER FOR THE MOMENT THEIR SIGN NOT JUST ONCE CONSTRUCTION BEGINS AND SPECIFICALLY HOW WITH THE STE HOW WILL THE STATE AND AND HOW CAN THE THE LEGISLATURE HELP IN EXPEDITING THE PERMITTING AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS REPORT PROCESS TO GET THESE GENERATION AND STORAGE PROJECTS -- BUILT UP WITH THAT URGENCY THAT WE'RE ALL FEELING AS AS I SAID SIR THANK YOU AS I SAID AND WE HAVE ALL AGREED WE DO SHARE AND FEEL VERY RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THAT URGENCY AND AS I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS -- WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS THAT ARE COMING ON LINE BETWEEN NOW AND AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ENSURING THAT -- THOSE PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED WE WILL BE -- WE ARE CURRENTLY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE WORKING WITH THE LSE'S TO ENSURE THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY DO IN TERMS OF THE PERMITTING -- THAT YOU MENTIONED MUCH OF THAT AND I BELIEVE -- MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THIS EARLIER SOME OF THAT -- MOST OF IT IS A IS A LOCAL ISSUE AND -- WE ARE -- WE ARE THE PC IS MONITORING ALL OF THOSE ACTIVITIES EXTREMELY CLOSELY AND AND WILL CONTINUE SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT IS CURRENT YOU KNOW THAT WE REALIZE IS IS GOING TO -- SLOW A PROJECT IN TERMS OF ITS DEVELOPMENT AND OUTCOME IN THE TIME FRAMES THAT WE HAVE SCHEDULED IT -- WE WILL -- INDEED BE WORKING WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS -- TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER ROADBLOCKS EXISTS THIS PROCESS OF THEM WE'RE VERY AWARE OF THE CONCERNS IS THERE A NEED FOR ANY LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO -- HELP WITH EXPEDITING THE PERMITTING AND THE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY NOW CERTAINLY I THINK THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR -- YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK TO SOME OF YOUR LOCAL CAN HE'S BUT NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO SIR OKAY -- MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM SAMBAR DINO -- MENTIONED EARLIER THE THE -- CONCERN ABOUT THE EXPEDITING THE INTERCONNECTION ALSO RAISES CONCERN WITH ME WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT HOW -- THE THE -- THEY WANTED TO ASK TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION DISTRIBUTION PROVIDERS -- CAN EXPEDITE INTERCONNECTION AND AVOID THE INTERCONNECTION DELAYS WHICH CAN SLOW DOWN PROJECTS BY MONTHS OR MORE I I I KNOW THAT THE QUESTION WAS -- RIGHT AND I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO YOU ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS AROUND INTERCONNECTION -- I KNOW WE'VE WORKED HARD ON THAT AND I DO HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF IN INFORMATION BEFORE ME SO I WANT TO BE SPENT ON SPECIFIC AND FACTUAL AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE ON THE INTERCONNECTION AND THE TIME FRAME THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW AND -- WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE MOST RECENT -- PASSED TO ADDRESS THEM ALL RIGHT LAST TO IN IN MY DISTRICT ANGELES COUNTY I HAVE ONE OF THE NATURAL GAS PEAKER PLANTS IN REDONDO BEACH AND -- YOU KNOW WILD AGAIN -- MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CUNNINGHAM REYES TO POINT ABOUT HOW NOT ONLY ARE WE CREATING NEW DEMANDS ON ELECTRICITY GENERATION BUT THAT WE ARE ALSO TAKING -- GENERATORS OFFLINE -- I KNOW THAT THIS IS -- IN A PART OF A THE PLAN THE STATEWIDE PLAN THAT -- THAT ALL OF YOU ALL ARE WORKING SO HARD BUT -- YOU KNOW A FROM MY COMMITTEE SICK I MEAN I I I WILL BE DOING MY JOB IF I DIDN'T RAISE THE THE CONCERN ABOUT HOW IN REDONDO BEACH IN A WEEK WE HAD BEEN PLANNING FOR TEN YEARS TO TAKE THAT -- NATURAL GAS POWER PLANT THERE WAS A ONE YEAR EXTENSION I BELIEVE THAT WAS EXTENDED FOR THE REDONDO BEACH POWER PLANTS YES HOW -- HOW RELIABLE IS THAT ONE YEAR POWER PLANT HOW TO HOW DO WE KNOW THAT TO THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE EXTENDED TO -- FOR MORE DOWN THE LINE WELL YOU KNOW THAT THE -- THE THREE OF US -- ASK FOR THAT EXTENSION THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE WATER BOARD -- AND IN THAT IN WE WERE ASKED THAT QUESTION AND WE SAID THAT -- WE FELT THAT THE ONE YEAR WAS WAS ADEQUATE -- AND AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO MONITOR BUT -- WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO COME BACK AND ASK ANOTHER TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU I WANTED TO TO SORT OF RAISE A QUICK QUESTION THAT I WOULD POST -- TO EACH OF YOU AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO OUR OUR PUBLIC FOR THEIR COMMENT A COUPLE YEARS AGO I INTRODUCED A BILL THAT ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF REGIONAL LIES IN THE GROUND AND ALLOWING FOR THE FOURTEEN WESTERN STATES TO PARTICIPATE IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY AND WHERE WE ARE IN A POSITION HAS BEEN DESCRIBED WHEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING HERE IT MAY BE BLOWING IN OTHER STATES AND WE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THAT -- POWER THAT'S PRODUCED FROM WIND -- AND OTHER OTHER STATES WHEN WE HAVE PRODUCED IN EXCESS OF SOLAR THEN WE BECOME AN EXPORTER AND WE HAVE GREATER EFFICIENCIES THAT WOULD BE DERIVED FROM THAT AND ULTIMATELY COST REDUCTION WHICH WE DON'T HEAR VERY OFTEN IN TERMS OF IMPACT ON RATEPAYERS JUST WANTED TO GET YOU GET YOUR SENSE OF THINGS BECAUSE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLANNING A LOT OF OUR PLANNING AND CONCEPTS OF PLANNING IS WITHIN OUR FOUR WALLS IF YOU WILL -- TOUR EXPAND AND TO HAVE AN INTERCONNECTED GRID WITH FOURTEEN WESTERN STATES PLANNING ON A LARGER -- BASIS CREATES EVEN I WOULD IMAGINE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND ARE WE FINDING OURSELVES GETTING CLOSER TO A POINT IN TIME WE'RE HAVING AN EXPANDED RATE REGIONAL READ MAKES MORE SENSE STEVE DO YOU WANT TO BEGIN GIVEN MY MY HISTORY ON THIS TOPIC AND THEN TURNED OVER TO MY SUCCESSOR MISTER MAYNES OR COLLABORATION -- IS CRITICAL TO HOLDING DOWN COSTS AND IT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY -- CONTRIBUTE TO RELIABILITY IT TAKES FRICTION OUT OF THE SYSTEM YOU'RE NOT NO YOU'RE NO LONGER COMPETING WITH ELECTRONS WITH OTHER BALANCING AREAS AND OTHER STATES AND ABILITY TO HAVE A PORTFOLIO FACT VERTICAL WITH RENEWABLES WHICH IS VERY POWERFUL AND ALL NOTES -- PREVIOUSLY I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN THAT THE OTHER STATES ARE OUT OF ALIGNMENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S POLICY OBJECTIVES BUT PRETTY MUCH MOST OF THE POPULATION IS IN THE WEST KNOWS AND STATES THAT ARE VERY ALIGNED WITH CALIFORNIA'S DOING SO -- I THINK THAT COLLABORATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD KNOW IS I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME -- SEEING IT WITH THE EUROPEANS ARE DOING THEY WERE ON A EUROPEAN WIDE DAY AHEAD MARKET SAID IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY COLLABORATE VERY WELL WITH TRANSMISSION PROJECTS AS AN EXAMPLE GERMANY HAS CONNECTED WITH NORWAY TO USE OUR HYDRO FLEET TO HELP INTERPRET THE RULES THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE REGIONAL IMPACT THE COLLABORATION AND I'M GONNA LEAVE IT AT THAT AND AND CONVERSATION TO BE HAD ABOUT IT WILL BE WITH MY SUCCESSOR WELL THANK THANK YOU STEPHEN AND CAROL I APPRECIATE YOU ASKING THE QUESTION OBVIOUSLY IS THE NEWCOMER HERE I HAVE A LOTS OF LISTENING TO MUCH OF LEARNING TO DO ON THIS TOPIC -- PARTICULARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'VE FIRST BEEN OPERATING IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST FOR LAST SEVERAL YEARS SINCE IT'S AN ISSUE OF TRACK CAREFULLY CLOSELY I THINK FOR ME FOR PURPOSES OF CONVERSATION TODAY -- I THINK THERE CERTAINLY ARE ARE LOTS OF OF OF APPEALING OPPORTUNITIES IN WIDE AREA COORDINATION WHETHER IT'S IN THE STATE'S SUBREGION REGIONAL CENTER AND I THINK THE PHYSICS AND THE ECONOMICS OF POWER SYSTEM CERTAINLY LEND THEMSELVES TO WIDER AREA SOLUTIONS BUT I THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE CONVERSATION TODAY I THINK YOU HEARD ME IN MY OPENING COMMENTS SAY THAT THAT YOU KNOW ACROSS THE WEST PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA IN OTHER IS IT'S THE SAME CONVERSATION HAPPEN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST YOU'RE GETTING RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND INTEGRATED PLANNING AND MARKET OPERATIONS WORKING REALLY WELL IT'S JUST IT'S JUST FOUNDATIONAL AND I THINK THERE IS THIS THIS IS A MOMENT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN INFLECTION POINT FOR CALIFORNIA ON THE PATH TO DO RELIABLY DECARBONISING ITS GRID I AM GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS CONVERSATION STAY AT THE GENERAL SENTIMENT THERE ISN'T THERE THERE'S INTEREST THERE'S A SENSE OF URGENCY A WILLINGNESS TO HELP A SENSE OF SHARED ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE NOW HAVE THAT SENSE OF URGENCY TO LEAN IN AND GET THESE FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES REALLY SORTED OUT BECAUSE AS WE'VE SEEN THE WEST IS AN INTERDEPENDENT MARKET TODAY WE YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT IMPORTS AND EXPORTS BUT IN ORDER TO BUILD THAT LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE TOWARDS BROADER EXPANSION OF OUR MARKETS WHETHER IT'S JUST INSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE CHASING WE DO NEED TO GET THESE ISSUES RIGHT AND I'M VERY VERY PLEASED TO BE JOINING THE TEAM HERE -- IN CALIFORNIA WONDERFUL GROUP OF COLLEAGUES TO WORK WITH ENGAGE LEGISLATORS I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THE CITIZENRY WHO CLEARLY CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THESE ISSUES I THINK THIS YEAR -- GOING INTO NEXT SUMMER'S A REAL TEST FOR ALL OF US IS YOU KNOW CAN WE REALLY BRING THAT NEXT SET OF SOLUTIONS TO THE TABLE BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE'VE ESTABLISHED ALREADY CREATE THAT SENSE OF URGENCY AND BE SITTING HERE A YEAR FROM NOW SAYING YOU KNOW WE REALLY DID LEARN FROM THE EVENTS OF AUGUST FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH AND RESULTED IN SOME SIGNIFICANT STEP UP IN OUR ACTIVITIES AND A LOT OF REALLY INTELLIGENT CAPABLE AND COMMITTED PEOPLE WITHOUT THE STATE WITH WITHIN THE STATE CONTRIBUTING TO THE SOLUTION SO WE GET THOSE THINGS RIGHT AND I THINK WE CAN REALLY TURN OUR ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE BROADER QUESTIONS ABOUT REGIONALIZATION I KNOW THAT OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA -- FOLKS ARE WATCHING CAREFULLY BOTH IN THEIR OWN IT SERVICE TERRITORIES AND IN THEIR DAY TO DAY INTERACTION WITH US AND I THINK THEY'RE HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL BE A GOOD MOMENT WHERE LESSONS ARE LEARNED AND WE CAN WE CAN JUST TAKE POSITIVE STEPS FORWARD SO CREATE THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN YES THANK YOU AND AND I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS THAT -- THAT MY COLLEAGUES FROM AYE SO HAVE JUST MADE -- I I PERSONALLY HAVE EVERY SUPPORTIVE OF REGIONALIZATION BUT I SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT MY PERSONAL -- THAT I'M SORRY RESIDENTS OKAY IT JUST SAID IN TERMS OF GETTING ARE A WHICH REALLY IS A SHORT TERM PLANNING TOOL THAT WE HAVE AND THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING RIGHT -- BUT IT ONLY MAKES LOGICAL SENSE TO ME THAT -- REGIONALIZATION IS SOMETHING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO LOOK AT VERY CLOSELY AND BECAME VERY CONSIDERATE OF -- HELLO ELECTRONS FLOW RATHER FREE IN SOME SENSE -- ACROSS OUR OUR STATE LINES AND I THINK THAT -- CAL I SYSTEM A LOT OF GOOD WORK IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS AROUND REGIONALIZATION AND IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE SOME OF THAT WORK THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS THAT THE TREND ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN TOWARDS REGIONALIZATION SO THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER LEGALIZATION WILL HAPPEN IN THE WEST IT'S WHETHER CALIFORNIA WILL PARTICIPATE IN THAT AND FOR THE REASONS YOU MENTIONED -- WITH RESPECT TO TO REDUCING RATES AND -- INSURING GREATER RELIABILITY IN CONNECTION I THINK THERE IS A REAL NEED TO EXAMINE THANK YOU CONVERSATION CONTINUES -- WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO THE PUBLIC FOR THEIR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME -- I'M LOOKING AROUND I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANYONE IN THE GALLERY WHO IS HERE FROM THE PUBLIC IF SO THAT WOULD BE THE TIME SAYING NONE OF LET'S GO TO OUR

COALITION UTILITY EMPLOYEES THE STATE ASSOCIATION ELECTRICAL WORKERS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL IN THE WEST UC'S COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS WE FOUND IT REALLY THERE'S NOTHING IDENTIFIED IN THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS THAT HAS NOT BEEN KNOWN FOR YEARS WELCOME IT'S POOR PLANNING AND FORECASTING AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO SINGLE ENTITY IN CHARGE OF RELIABILITY THE STATE IN ARGUE IS IN REAL TROUBLE AND THERE'S NO SHORT TERM SOLUTION THE ONLY WAY OUT IS ADDRESSING OUR LONG TERM RELIABILITY AND BUILDING OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM THROUGH INCREASED CAPACITY BUT THAT WILL TAKE LARGEST BEST INVESTMENT THAT MUST START IMMEDIATELY WHAT I'VE HEARD TODAY IS THAT THERE'S TOOLS UNDER DEVELOPMENT PLANS ARE BEING PLANNED IN WORKSHOPS ARE BEING SCHEDULED AND THAT NOW WE HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY THE FACT IS WE NEED TO INVEST IMMEDIATELY IN PROJECTS LIKE PUMP STORAGE THEY CAN PROVIDE A LARGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY WITHIN SECONDS TO MEET SYSTEM CONDITIONS THERE IS NO SCENARIO WOULD PUMP STORAGE ISN'T THE RIGHT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED IN THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS GET THE STATE ACTED NOW THE EAGLE MOUNTAIN PUMPED STORAGE PLANT COULD BE ONLINE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO COINCIDE WITH THE DECOMMISSIONING OF THE APPLE CANYON PROVIDING THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS MUCH NEEDED INERGY RELIABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS WE WOULD URGE ALL THREE OF THE CITY'S TO REDOUBLE THEIR EFFORTS GIVEBACK RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FOR PROCUREMENT -- IF NOT IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- HERE TO SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS DID NOT PUT ITS FINGER ON THE SCALE AND ANYONE PARTICULAR SECUREMENT ROGER -- THERE WAS CERTAINLY TODAY A LOT OF EXCUSE ME A LOT OF QUESTIONS AROUND PARTICULAR PROJECTS OR PARTICULAR TYPES OF PROJECTS

STATES IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND I JUST I'M I WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THE COMMENTS TODAY ABOUT POPULAR WIND AND I THINK I JUST WANT TO QUICKLY EMPHASIZED THAT WOULD BE STATE OF

CHAIRMAN AT THE TELLING POINT WITH OFFSHORE WIND CALIFORNIA -- JUST WANTED TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH FIRE COMMENT ON -- THE NEED TO INCLUDE OPTIONAL NGUYEN IN LONG TERM PLANNING BUT STRESSED THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY IS THAT WE NEED -- A RESILIENT A WELL BALANCED GOD CREATED THE RESILIENT WRITTEN WELL DOLLARS RESOURCES WILL HELP REDUCE COSTS ON TO CUSTOMERS AND WILL SUPPORT THE LIABILITY WE NEED TO DO BETTER LONG TERM PLANNING FOR RESOURCES BUDGET OFFICE FOR NGUYEN -- AND -- PEOPLE BALLOT WELL WITH DISTRIBUTED GENERATION WITH STORAGE -- WITH ALL THESE OTHER RESOURCES TO MAKE CALIFORNIA MUCH MORE CLIMATE RESILIENT AT THE SAME TIME WHICH SHOULD BE A CONSIDERATION WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT RETORTED THAT ARE GOING TO AID WITH CLIMATE RESILIENT AS IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY A FACTOR THAT IMPACTS RELIABILITY AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THINGS LIKE HYDROGEN STORAGE -- WELL PREPARED RECOLLECTED LIKE OPTIONAL WIND THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND OUR LAST LINE WILL COME FROM LINE NUMBER ONE EIGHTEEN YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN HELLO THANK YOU THIS IS DANIEL GOLDIN PRESIDENT OF COMMUNITY CHOICE PARTNERS -- THE PRELIMINARY REPORT CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM THAT THE UNDER SCHEDULING OF LOAD BY SCHEDULING COORDINATORS YOU CAN UTILITIES AND DIRECT ACCESS CENTER AT THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECT NOT THE NOT THE ENERGY MARKET APPROPRIATELY REFLECT THE ACTUAL NEED ON THE SYSTEM AND SUBSEQUENTLY SIGNALING THAT MORE EXPORTS WERE ULTIMATELY THE PORTABLE FROM INTERNAL RESOURCES UNFORTUNATELY THE PRELIMINARY REPORT DOESN'T DETAIL WHY LOAD SERVING ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA COLLECTIVELY FAILED TO ACCURATELY FORECAST YOUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS ELECTRICITY USAGE BUT I THINK I CAN OFFER DEEPER INSIGHT ON THAT SUBJECT I'M GOING TO ECHO WHAT CALPERS DEL HAD EARLIER ALMOST EVERY RETAIL CUSTOMER IN CALIFORNIA HAS THE SMART METER YOUR RECORD HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY BEING USED ON AN HOUR EARLIER IN THE DEBATE THAT DATA IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE IN TERMS OF ENHANCING THE ACCURACY OF SHORT TERM LOCAL FORECAST THAT'S WHY THE UTILITIES COLLECT AND USE THAT DATA TO REFRESH THEIR OWN FORECAST OF THE ELECTRICIAN THE DEMAND PATTERNS THREE OR FOUR TIMES EVERY DAY HOWEVER THE UTILITIES DO NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THIS DATA IN A TIMELY FASHION FOR COMMUNITY TOWARD AGGREGATORS USE IN THEIR TYPES OF DEBT MARKET GLOBAL FORECAST TO CONSEQUENTLY COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS THEIR FORECASTS ARE BEING SYSTEMATICALLY DISADVANTAGED INTEGRATED IN TERMS OF ACCURACY THIS IS CONTRARY TO LAW AB -- SB SEVEN NINETY WITH WOULD BE REQUIRED UTILITIES TO PURGE THIS DATA BUT THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THE COMMISSION AT HALF TO ENSURE THAT THE AID AT THE DATA NECESSARY TO PRODUCE ACCURATE SHORT TERM LOAN FORECAST IN OTHER WORDS THEY HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE START ACTUALLY USING OUR SMART METERS THAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED SO IN CONCLUSION I THINK THIS MIGHT THIS ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE RARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH A COMPLEX PROBLEM HAS A VERY EASY SOLUTION THANK YOU THANK YOU I I THINK THAT THE THE POINT LOOK TO SEE IF YOU SEE TO -- REVIEW ALL OF THE COMMENTS NOT EVERYTHING EVERYTHING AND WE APPRECIATE ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR COMMENTS TODAY TO THE PUBLIC -- VEHICLE AND AND CERTAINLY PHONE MODERATOR THANK YOU -- YOU CAN CLOSE THE LINE WE WILL TAKE ALL OF THOSE COMMENTS AND AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE CHANNELED TO EVERYONE WHO HAS THE JURISDICTION OVER AN ANSWER AND IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO ALSO ADD IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ON TODAY AND SOME WERE NOT SO IF WE CAN ENTRUST YOU WITH THE QUESTIONS AND IF YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS OVERHEARD A TIME WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT -- THANK YOU THIS RACE FOR HANG IN THERE WITH ME ALL THE WAY TO THE END -- I REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE COME OUT TODAY THIS IS YOU KNOW WITHOUT DOUBT -- VERY DIFFICULT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE ALL HAD TO DEAL WITH AND BACK IN AUGUST WHEN IT WAS ALL HAPPENING REAL TIME IT WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ALL OF US TO RESPOND TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING OF THIS COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THESE TYPES OF ISSUES AND SO -- WITH EVERYTHING SORT OF EVOLVING IN A IN A WAY THAT WE WERE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NOT TO CONTROL OR DIZZINESS FROM HOW QUICKLY WERE SPENDING -- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ENOUGH TIME ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION TO HAVE THIS ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS ESTABLISHED -- IT WOULD GIVE US AT LEAST OF -- A FOUNDATION TO HAVE A HEARING LIKE THIS AND SO WE WOULD NOT WE WOULD WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE ORGANIZED AND THOUGHTFUL IN TERMS AND MORE STRATEGIC IN TERMS OF ARE QUESTIONING SO I HOPE IT'S BEEN HELPFUL TO ALL OF YOU -- TO TO HEAR FROM OUR COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO THINK OF PRESIDENT BADGERS -- ALSO SURE HARSHAL AND WELCOME
