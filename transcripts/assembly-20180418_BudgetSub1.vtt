PROPOSAL SCORES SHOULD BE

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:39.764 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT TO THE LONGEVITY OF

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:41.633 region:rollup2
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND THE

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:43.601 region:rollup2
STRENGTH OF LOCAL TIES

00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:45.370 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED BY APPLICANTS.

PRIORITY STATUS.

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:53.912 region:rollup2

I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE

00:37:23.208 --> 00:37:25.810 region:rollup2
LIGHT WENT.

00:37:24.943 --> 00:37:27.112 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH MANY OF THE THINGS

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.413 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SAID I TAKE ISSUE WITH

00:37:27.112 --> 00:37:30.615 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT

00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:31.549 region:rollup2
WERE SAID SO. LET ME BE PLAIN I

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:32.584 region:rollup2
AM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE LOW

00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:33.518 region:rollup2
INCOME OVERSIGHT BOARD WITH THE

00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:35.086 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:36.421 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.088 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S KIND OF

00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:39.257 region:rollup2
INTERESTING.

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:41.459 region:rollup2
HERE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS THE

00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:42.861 region:rollup2
CONVERGENCE OF LOW INCOME ENERGY

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.461 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE.

00:37:42.861 --> 00:37:45.029 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING DIFFERENT FUNDING

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:46.231 region:rollup2
STREAM.

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:46.731 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THE CHALLENGE IS GOING

00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:48.800 region:rollup2
TO BE WHAT CAN WE DO TO

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:50.502 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.569 region:rollup2
YOU NO SERVICES AND FUNDING THAT

00:37:50.502 --> 00:37:52.604 region:rollup2
WOULD COME FROM THE FEDERAL

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.738 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD COME FROM

00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:54.572 region:rollup2
THE STATE GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:56.174 region:rollup2
COME FROM UTILITIES AND

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:57.175 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS.

00:37:56.174 --> 00:37:59.744 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WOULD COME FROM.

00:37:57.175 --> 00:38:02.147 region:rollup2
BASICALLY THE ACTIONS OF CS BG

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:02.714 region:rollup2
HAD WE HAD WE BRING ALL THIS

00:38:02.147 --> 00:38:03.047 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO HAVE MAXIMUM OF

00:38:02.714 --> 00:38:04.916 region:rollup2
FACT.

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:06.551 region:rollup2
WITH COMMUNITIES

00:38:04.916 --> 00:38:08.052 region:rollup2
SO LET ME ADDRESS SOME

00:38:06.551 --> 00:38:09.420 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY IN TERMS OF MOVING

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:11.623 region:rollup2
FORWARD I THINK THAT THE OPEN

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.190 region:rollup2
SOLICITATION PROCESS.

00:38:11.623 --> 00:38:13.625 region:rollup2
MAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.692 region:rollup2
SENSE

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:16.161 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOR CST I THINK WAS A

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:18.997 region:rollup2
BOLD MOVE ON THEIR PART TWO

00:38:16.161 --> 00:38:20.765 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO. I WAS.

00:38:18.997 --> 00:38:22.100 region:rollup2
DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT CST BACK IN

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.935 region:rollup2
THE NINETIES

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.470 region:rollup2
SO I AM FAMILIAR WITH THEIR A

00:38:23.935 --> 00:38:27.472 region:rollup2
SERVICE PROVIDER NETWORK.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:29.941 region:rollup2
I AM ALSO FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT

00:38:27.472 --> 00:38:31.142 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE PARTICULAR FUNDS ARE.

00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:32.343 region:rollup2
EARMARKED THEY AREN'T THEY'RE

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:33.745 region:rollup2
NOT PUT OUT FOR COMPETITIVE

00:38:32.343 --> 00:38:34.979 region:rollup2
SOLICITATION.

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:36.514 region:rollup2
BUT HAVING SAID THAT LIE WET

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:37.582 region:rollup2
WENT DOWN A DIFFERENT TRACK IN

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:39.751 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE IDEA OF BEING

00:38:37.582 --> 00:38:40.685 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE IN PRODUCTION.

00:38:39.751 --> 00:38:41.953 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INCREASE

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:43.087 region:rollup2
PERFORMS WHO PRODUCTION WE'RE

00:38:41.953 --> 00:38:45.323 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT MORE SERVICES

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:46.791 region:rollup2
GOING INTO THE COMMUNITIES.

00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:49.027 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE AT

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:50.695 region:rollup2
THE CPC. IS CLIMATE CHANGE

00:38:49.027 --> 00:38:52.263 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE NOT ONLY IN TERMS

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:53.865 region:rollup2
OF IMPACT.

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:55.033 region:rollup2
I ENVIRONMENTALLY BUT TAUGHT

00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:56.267 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE IN TERMS OF

00:38:55.033 --> 00:38:58.069 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL BURDEN TO LOW INCOME

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:59.204 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:00.138 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WERE REGIONS ARE

00:38:59.204 --> 00:39:01.840 region:rollup2
GETTING HOTTER AND THEY'RE

00:39:00.138 --> 00:39:03.341 region:rollup2
GETTING COLDER.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.109 region:rollup2
THE COST OF UTILITIES AS A

00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:06.845 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL COMPONENT FOR MANY OF

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:07.812 region:rollup2
THESE HOLES HOUSEHOLDS IS.

00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:09.914 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO CONSIDERATION AFTER

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:10.982 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:13.251 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT Y. WHAT

00:39:10.982 --> 00:39:14.552 region:rollup2
BRINGS AS PART OF THIS

00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:16.521 region:rollup2
CONVERGENCE OF PROGRAMS.

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:17.522 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF THINGS.

00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:19.190 region:rollup2
IT INTRODUCES THE SOLAR

00:39:17.522 --> 00:39:20.725 region:rollup2
COMPONENT BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.459 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE ENERGY PROGRAMS THAT

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:23.394 region:rollup2
ARE BEING ADMINISTERED BY THE

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:24.729 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:26.431 region:rollup2
THIRTY THE ENERGY SAVINGS

00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:27.865 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE ACCOUNT IT DOES NOT

00:39:26.431 --> 00:39:29.467 region:rollup2
CONTAIN A SOLAR COMPONENT SO

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:31.202 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THAT ME.

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:32.971 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE COOLING MEASURES

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:35.740 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD INSTALL IN HOMES

00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:37.208 region:rollup2
AND FRESNO KERN KINGS COUNTY.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.743 region:rollup2
AT SOME OF THE OTHER MORE ARID

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.777 region:rollup2
REGIONS AT THE STATE SIMPLY ARE

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:41.145 region:rollup2
NOT ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THE COST

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:43.615 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS.

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:45.550 region:rollup2
YOU BRING IN SOLAR.

00:39:43.615 --> 00:39:47.285 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS IS ALLEVIATED.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.953 region:rollup2
SO HAVING SAID THAT ONE OF THE

00:39:47.285 --> 00:39:50.622 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT LIE WHIP IS DONE

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:52.223 region:rollup2
WITH AN OPEN SOLICITATION IT'S

00:39:50.622 --> 00:39:54.559 region:rollup2
IT BROUGHT AND IT HAS.

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:56.461 region:rollup2
BY IT BROUGHT IN BEST OF BREED

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:58.563 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS.

00:39:56.461 --> 00:39:59.697 region:rollup2
FROM AGAIN THE EAST OR THE

00:39:58.563 --> 00:40:00.932 region:rollup2
ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE

00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:03.835 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:05.270 region:rollup2
WITH THE UTILITY PROGRAMS.

00:40:03.835 --> 00:40:06.804 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.506 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MENTION

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:09.073 region:rollup2
I'M ALSO ON THE BORDER DIRECTORS

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:10.208 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE OPERATE THE OF A

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:11.809 region:rollup2
COMPASS CENA.

00:40:10.208 --> 00:40:13.211 region:rollup2
WHERE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:15.847 region:rollup2
FARMWORKERS SERVICE PROVIDERS WE

00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:17.982 region:rollup2
ARE A MAJOR ADMINISTRATOR? AND

00:40:15.847 --> 00:40:19.884 region:rollup2
WE WORKED WITH LOCAL COMPANIES

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:21.786 region:rollup2
IN TERMS TO LIE WITH PROGRAM.

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:23.254 region:rollup2
SO GAS YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:25.590 region:rollup2
COULD COULD COULD USE SOME

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:26.691 region:rollup2
CHANGES A YES WE DO AGREE WITH

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.426 region:rollup2
S. B. EIGHTY NINE IN TERMS OF

00:40:26.691 --> 00:40:29.794 region:rollup2
ITS INTENT.

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:32.196 region:rollup2
ARE WE FRANKLY I WOULD LIKE TO

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:34.399 region:rollup2
SEE.

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:35.767 region:rollup2
NO SORT OF BINDING CONTRACTUAL

00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:37.235 region:rollup2
PRIORITY.

00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:38.803 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT.

00:40:37.235 --> 00:40:40.538 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND OPEN SOLICITATION

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:42.340 region:rollup2
SHOULD FOCUS ON.

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:44.108 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.710 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES IN

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:47.679 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY NOT ONLY THE

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:49.614 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO GENERATE. JOBS IN THE

00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:51.983 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IT SERVES.

00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:52.517 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE

00:40:51.983 --> 00:40:53.885 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A MAJOR

00:40:52.517 --> 00:40:54.886 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:40:53.885 --> 00:41:04.595 region:rollup2
AND CONNECTION WITH THESE

00:40:54.886 --> 00:41:05.229 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IS GETTING THE SPENT

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:05.863 region:rollup2
GETTING THEM SPENT EFFICIENTLY.

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:06.464 region:rollup2
SO WE FEEL THAT OPENING UP THE

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.131 region:rollup2
SOLICITATION ARE BRINGING IT

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:07.765 region:rollup2
FORWARD. TO SUCCESSFUL SORTS OF

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:09.300 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS SORT OF NONPROFIT

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:11.269 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS THAT LIE WEPT TO A

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.570 region:rollup2
LARGE DEGREE REPRESENTS.

00:41:11.269 --> 00:41:13.905 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A VERY UNIQUE I'VE BEEN

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.773 region:rollup2
IN GOVERNMENT FOR TWENTY FIVE

00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:17.642 region:rollup2
YEARS AND THE BEST PUBLIC

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:20.144 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT I SEE

00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:21.612 region:rollup2
OUT THERE DELIVERING SERVICES.

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:23.614 region:rollup2
THROUGH A PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:24.749 region:rollup2
TARGETING LOW INCOME.

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:26.918 region:rollup2
IT'S THE COMBINATION OF FOR

00:41:24.749 --> 00:41:29.187 region:rollup2
PROFIT AND NONPROFIT SERVICE

00:41:26.918 --> 00:41:30.321 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ON ENERGY ASSISTANCE.

00:41:29.187 --> 00:41:32.023 region:rollup2
WHICH SHOULD NOT TRY TO HAMPER

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:34.025 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO ENCOURAGE

00:41:32.023 --> 00:41:36.294 region:rollup2
IT WE SHOULD TRY TO BUILD ON.

00:41:34.025 --> 00:41:38.363 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK MOVING FORWARD. IF

00:41:36.294 --> 00:41:40.298 region:rollup2
THE BCP IS A GRANTED AND WE

00:41:38.363 --> 00:41:42.600 region:rollup2
THINK IF YOU KNOW AGAIN WE LOOK

00:41:40.298 --> 00:41:44.102 region:rollup2
AT ALSO. NATALIE UNMET NEED BUT

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.470 region:rollup2
THE WAITING LIST.

00:41:44.102 --> 00:41:46.437 region:rollup2
AND MULTI FAMILY ALONE IT

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.172 region:rollup2
EXCEEDS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:49.440 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:51.008 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT ARE VAST AND HAVE

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.510 region:rollup2
NOT RECEIVED SERVICES. THROUGH

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:54.645 region:rollup2
THE LIE WHAT PROGRAM.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:57.048 region:rollup2

01:32:36.418 --> 01:32:39.721 region:rollup2
TO THE AUTOMATED SERVICES

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:41.523 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE WITHIN THE CHILD

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:42.991 region:rollup2
SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM.

01:32:41.523 --> 01:32:44.793 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO OPEN A CASE IS

01:32:42.991 --> 01:32:47.128 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT TAKES.

01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:49.364 region:rollup2
A LOT OF WORK DETECTIVE WORK I

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:50.698 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY TO FIND AND TO FIND

01:32:49.364 --> 01:32:52.467 region:rollup2
INCOME ORDER FIND AN EMPLOYER.

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:54.235 region:rollup2
YOU NEED A PERSON IN ORDER TO DO

01:32:52.467 --> 01:32:55.970 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED A PERSON TO

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:58.673 region:rollup2
ANALYZE THOSE RESULTS.

01:32:55.970 --> 01:33:00.308 region:rollup2
WE'D LIKE TO LOOK IT UP

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:01.776 region:rollup2
REDUCING THE TIME IT TAKES FROM

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:03.478 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU OPEN THE CASE TO WHEN

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:05.013 region:rollup2
YOU ACTUALLY GET A PAYMENT.

01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:06.614 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW I THINK THE STATE WIDE

01:33:05.013 --> 01:33:08.450 region:rollup2
AVERAGES OVER TWO HUNDRED DAYS.

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:08.950 region:rollup2
COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU HAD TO

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:10.151 region:rollup2
GO IN AND YOU REQUESTED

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:12.387 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:13.521 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING BACK FOR

01:33:12.387 --> 01:33:15.123 region:rollup2
NEAR FROM MORE THAN HALF A YEAR.

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:17.392 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:33:15.123 --> 01:33:19.127 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY. UP A TERRIBLE

01:33:17.392 --> 01:33:20.361 region:rollup2
STAND ON OUR PROGRAM WE WANT TO

01:33:19.127 --> 01:33:21.763 region:rollup2
REDUCE THAT AND WE THINK WITH

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:23.264 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CASEWORKERS. WE'D BE

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:24.999 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:26.301 region:rollup2
AND AND OF COURSE THE OTHER

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:27.802 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE THINK THAT WE

01:33:26.301 --> 01:33:29.204 region:rollup2
COULD DO TREMENDOUSLY WITH THE

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:30.872 region:rollup2
MONEY IS TO INCREASE. ADDITIONAL

01:33:29.204 --> 01:33:32.540 region:rollup2
COLLECTIONS.

01:33:30.872 --> 01:33:34.008 region:rollup2
THAT ARE FOURTEEN COUNTIES COULD

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:35.443 region:rollup2
PRODUCE WE ALSO THINK THAT THAT

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:37.078 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE.

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:39.080 region:rollup2
AND ADDITIONAL EFFORT BECAUSE OF

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:41.382 region:rollup2
FILE WERE ABLE TO BRING HIM THE

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.883 region:rollup2
MONEY AND AND WE'RE ABLE TO TAKE

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:43.218 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF INNOVATIVE

01:33:41.883 --> 01:33:44.752 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:33:43.218 --> 01:33:46.421 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE THOSE BEST

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:47.088 region:rollup2
PRACTICES

01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:48.556 region:rollup2
TO ARE COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE

01:33:47.088 --> 01:33:50.091 region:rollup2
STATE. TO RETHINK THAT THERE MAY

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:55.930 region:rollup2
ALSO BE AN ABILITY TO INCREASE

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:56.664 region:rollup2
COLLECTIONS STATEWIDE AS WELL.

01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:58.733 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO.

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:59.968 region:rollup2
.

01:33:58.733 --> 01:34:01.769 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND A BIT MORE FOR CAN

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:04.005 region:rollup2
FROM THE DEPARTMENT WHY WERE IN

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:06.508 region:rollup2
THIS STAGE I. BELIEVE IT'S OF

01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:08.409 region:rollup2
BUDGETING METHODOLOGY AND THAT

01:34:06.508 --> 01:34:11.513 region:rollup2
SPACE ALLOCATION THAT'S JUST

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:13.715 region:rollup2
STATUTORILY FROM MANY YEARS AGO.

01:34:11.513 --> 01:34:14.616 region:rollup2
AND I'M.

01:34:13.715 --> 01:34:17.185 region:rollup2
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE

01:34:14.616 --> 01:34:18.052 region:rollup2
WAS ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT IT

01:34:17.185 --> 01:34:19.787 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:20.755 region:rollup2
MOVE THE.

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:21.523 region:rollup2
UP TO SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:34:20.755 --> 01:34:23.525 region:rollup2
DOLLARS

01:34:21.523 --> 01:34:24.859 region:rollup2
WAS THERE ANY.

01:34:23.525 --> 01:34:25.860 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT DISPLACING

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.695 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FROM COUNTIES WHO ARE

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.898 region:rollup2
ABOVE THAT.

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:33.234 region:rollup2
I ONLY ASK.

01:34:29.898 --> 01:34:35.537 region:rollup2
AND DO BELIEVE THAT. ULTIMATELY

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:36.905 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE A

01:34:35.537 --> 01:34:38.540 region:rollup2
HOLD HARMLESS POLICY BUT WANTED

01:34:36.905 --> 01:34:39.507 region:rollup2
TO.

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:41.743 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IF THOSE DISCUSSIONS

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:43.845 region:rollup2
DID HAPPEN.

01:34:41.743 --> 01:34:45.180 region:rollup2
SURE I MISTER.

01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:47.582 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL.

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:49.083 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS SINCE THE PROGRAM.

01:34:47.582 --> 01:34:50.818 region:rollup2
.

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:52.120 region:rollup2
WAS REFORMED.

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:53.655 region:rollup2
AROUND BUDGET ALLOCATION

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.356 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY I THINK SOME OF THE

01:34:53.655 --> 01:34:57.425 region:rollup2
CURRENT.

01:34:55.356 --> 01:34:58.726 region:rollup2
DISPARITY AND COSTS AMONG THE LC

01:34:57.425 --> 01:35:00.161 region:rollup2
ESSAYS ARE FUNDING AMONG THE

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:02.063 region:rollup2
ALSO SAY'S HAS TO DO WITH.

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:04.232 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL FUNDING FORMULAS

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:05.767 region:rollup2
UNDER THE DA'S OFFICES COUNTIES

01:35:04.232 --> 01:35:07.502 region:rollup2
COULD CONTRIBUTE VARYING LEVELS

01:35:05.767 --> 01:35:09.304 region:rollup2
OF COUNTY SHARES AND TO ANSWER

01:35:07.502 --> 01:35:09.837 region:rollup2
THOSE COUNTIES. THAT INVESTED

01:35:09.304 --> 01:35:12.473 region:rollup2
MORE IN THEIR CHILD'S FOR

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:13.474 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND TO DO BETTER THAN

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:15.009 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO INVEST IT LASTS.

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:16.110 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S ALSO FOR A TWO YEAR

01:35:15.009 --> 01:35:17.312 region:rollup2
PERIOD SOMETHING HALL THE

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:18.780 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT

01:35:17.312 --> 01:35:20.882 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA.

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:22.984 region:rollup2
THAT BASICALLY GAVE THE COUNTIES

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:23.518 region:rollup2
AND ALLOCATION BASED ON THIRTEEN

01:35:22.984 --> 01:35:24.619 region:rollup2
POINT SIX PERCENT OF THEIR

01:35:23.518 --> 01:35:25.386 region:rollup2
COLLECTIONS.

01:35:24.619 --> 01:35:27.121 region:rollup2
SAVE YOUR.

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:28.790 region:rollup2
I COUNTY WITH SAY MORE AFFLUENT

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:30.825 region:rollup2
CASE LADY TEND TO HAVE HIGHER

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:32.660 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION THOSE ARE LESS

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:33.895 region:rollup2
AFFLUENT HAVE LOWER ALLOCATIONS.

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:35.296 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING FOR MILLET WAS

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:36.364 region:rollup2
SUSPENDED TWO THOUSAND THREE

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:37.732 region:rollup2
FORM BECAUSE IT WAS CREATING

01:35:36.364 --> 01:35:39.200 region:rollup2
SUCH DISPARITIES AMONG THE

01:35:37.732 --> 01:35:41.736 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:43.271 region:rollup2
AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK.

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.272 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT AS CONVENED A

01:35:43.271 --> 01:35:45.340 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF WORK GROUPS TO TALK

01:35:44.272 --> 01:35:46.841 region:rollup2
ABOUT DIFFERENT ALLOCATION

01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:49.644 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGIES.

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:51.579 region:rollup2
SAM YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT

01:35:49.644 --> 01:35:52.947 region:rollup2
THOSE GROUPS THAT STRUGGLE TO

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:54.515 region:rollup2
REACH CONSENSUS SO THAT'S ONE OF

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:55.049 region:rollup2
THE REASONS WHY YOU DIDN'T SEE

01:35:54.515 --> 01:35:56.851 region:rollup2
ANY BUDGET METHODOLOGY PUT

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:58.052 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:59.787 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE IS THE ISSUE

01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:01.389 region:rollup2
THAT YOU POINTED TO THAT IF

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:03.191 region:rollup2
THERE WASN'T THE IF THERE WAS AN

01:36:01.389 --> 01:36:04.792 region:rollup2
NEW FUNDING INTRODUCED INTO THE

01:36:03.191 --> 01:36:06.327 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:07.528 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:08.429 region:rollup2
RANDY ALLOCATIONS YOU WOULD HAVE

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:10.031 region:rollup2
THOSE WINNERS AND LOSERS

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:10.832 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS.

01:36:10.031 --> 01:36:12.200 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE CONCERN IS IS

01:36:10.832 --> 01:36:14.302 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.703 region:rollup2
KICK CRATE GROSS DISRUPTIONS

01:36:14.302 --> 01:36:17.338 region:rollup2
AMONG THE SYSTEM.

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:19.240 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU'RE A COUNTY WHO'S MORE

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:20.942 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY FUNDED. AND YOU

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.343 region:rollup2
TRANSFER YOU KNOW FUNDING TO AN

01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:23.878 region:rollup2
UNDERFUNDED COUNTY WHAT IS THAT

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:25.280 region:rollup2
DUE TO YOUR IN HOUSE STAFFING

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:26.681 region:rollup2
AND YOUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.316 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:36:26.681 --> 01:36:30.018 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN A FIVE FUNDING

01:36:28.316 --> 01:36:31.686 region:rollup2
SCENARIO WHERE COAL IS WILL

01:36:30.018 --> 01:36:32.754 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO EAT AWAY AT YOUR

01:36:31.686 --> 01:36:34.722 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FUNDING.

01:36:32.754 --> 01:36:35.490 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY WHERE DOES IT BUT

01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:37.125 region:rollup2
THOSE COUNTIES WHO ARE

01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:38.426 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY FUNDED EVENTUALLY GET

01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:39.627 region:rollup2
TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'LL BE

01:36:38.426 --> 01:36:40.461 region:rollup2
UNDER FUNDED THEMSELVES.

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:42.030 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:43.798 region:rollup2
REALLY BEEN FOCUSED ON A MORE

01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:45.233 region:rollup2
HOLISTIC SOLUTION. TROY ADDRESS

01:36:43.798 --> 01:36:47.302 region:rollup2
FUNDING ISSUES.

01:36:45.233 --> 01:36:48.469 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:49.837 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOR THE PROGRAM AS A

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:52.106 region:rollup2
WHOLE AND ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:53.608 region:rollup2
THAT WORKS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES.

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:55.576 region:rollup2
I SAW OFFERING SUMMER.

01:36:53.608 --> 01:36:57.812 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOURTEEN COUNTIES.

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:59.113 region:rollup2
WE USE THE SIX HUNDRED THIRTY

01:36:57.812 --> 01:37:01.182 region:rollup2
DOLLARS COST PER CASE

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:02.417 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY BECAUSE IT WAS AN

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:04.552 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE WAY.

01:37:02.417 --> 01:37:06.320 region:rollup2
TO TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT A

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:08.323 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM HOWEVER

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.857 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOURTEEN I WOULD SAY

01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:12.327 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE VERY FLEXIBLE. IN

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:13.895 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT THE METHODOLOGY.

01:37:12.327 --> 01:37:15.697 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE AND COULD BE SO.

01:37:13.895 --> 01:37:17.532 region:rollup2
IN.

01:37:15.697 --> 01:37:18.700 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S MANY WAYS. THAT

01:37:17.532 --> 01:37:19.701 region:rollup2
THAT METHODOLOGY COULD BE

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:21.936 region:rollup2
CALCULATED.

01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:23.604 region:rollup2
COST PER CASES ONE AND COST PER

01:37:21.936 --> 01:37:24.806 region:rollup2
FTE IS ANOTHER BUT I JUST WANTED

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:26.908 region:rollup2
TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT WERE

01:37:24.806 --> 01:37:28.643 region:rollup2
VERY FLEXIBLE. IN TERMS OF HOW

01:37:26.908 --> 01:37:29.277 region:rollup2
THAT METHODOLOGY CANON SHOULD

01:37:28.643 --> 01:37:33.748 region:rollup2
LOOK IN THE FUTURE.

01:37:29.277 --> 01:37:34.916 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:37:33.748 --> 01:37:36.851 region:rollup2
OUR COMMITTEE IS GOING TO WANT

01:37:34.916 --> 01:37:37.885 region:rollup2
THOUGH LOOKING TO LOOK AT THIS

01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:40.021 region:rollup2
HOLISTIC.

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:41.155 region:rollup2
RESULT AFTERWARDS AND WILL HOPE

01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:42.890 region:rollup2
THAT YOU INCLUDE US AFTER THE

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:43.391 region:rollup2
COMPLETION OF THESE NEXT THREE

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:45.293 region:rollup2
MEETINGS SO THAT WE CAN

01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:46.160 region:rollup2
DELIVERY.

01:37:45.293 --> 01:37:48.196 region:rollup2
WHO TRYING TO GET AN

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.098 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF TIMING IS THIS

01:37:48.196 --> 01:37:52.100 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK WE WILL

01:37:50.098 --> 01:37:54.702 region:rollup2
BE AVAILABLE TO? COME TO SOME

01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:55.970 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION BEFORE MAY REVISE

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:57.805 region:rollup2
OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S

01:37:55.970 --> 01:38:00.575 region:rollup2
GOING TO NEED TO GO PAST THIS

01:37:57.805 --> 01:38:02.610 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR.
