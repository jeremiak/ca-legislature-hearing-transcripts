STREAMING -- WELCOME THIS IS THE FIRST OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE TWO HEARINGS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAURA FRIEDMAN FROM THE FORTY THIRD ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND I'M JOINED TODAY BY MY COLLEAGUE ELOISE REYES. WHO IS -- I'M ONE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M AFTER THIS HEARING WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING A SIMILAR HEARING IN THE CENTRAL COAST -- AND WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GO TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN HAVING US AS WELL. OF THE REASON THAT I HAD ASKED YOU CAN -- TO HOWEVER A COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS IS BECAUSE AFTER BEING IN SACRAMENTO FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS I'M IN MY FIRST TERM. I NOTICE THAT LARGE BUSINESSES HAVE A VERY LARGE VOICE -- WHATEVER WHERE ARE LOOKING TO ADOPT A NEW REGULATION -- WE HEAR A LOT FROM OUR LARGER BUSINESSES. BUT WE DON'T HEAR AS MUCH FROM THE SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO HAVE A UNIFIED VOICE. WHEN IT COMES TO STATEWIDE POLICY [INAUDIBLE] AND WHAT'S [INAUDIBLE] EASY. TO COMPLY WITH FOR VERY LARGE BUSINESS. CAN BE A HUGE HURDLE FOR SMALLER BUSINESS. OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WE ALWAYS HEAR THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE SPEND ENOUGH TIME REALLY LISTENING TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. FOR ONE THING THE LANDSCAPE OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS -- I THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN TO THINK OF OUR SMALLEST ENTREPRENEURS THE ONE PERSON TO PERSON BUSINESSES AS ALSO BEING IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THEY ARE AFFECTED VERY VERY DIFFERENTLY TO LICENSURE REGULATION TAX STRUCTURE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT AFFECT BUSINESS VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN LARGE BUSINESSES AND EVEN FOR A LARGER SMALL BUSINESSES. SO TODAY WHAT I WANT TO TRY TO DO IS TO HEAR FROM A LOT OF THE EXPERTS FROM FROM SOME FROM SOME OF OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL. TO HERE ABOUT THEIR ISSUES ABOUT BARRIERS IN OPPORTUNITIES FROM SACRAMENTO. SO THAT WE CAN BETTER CRAFT LEGISLATION AND BE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESSES. NOW I KNOW THAT DIFFERENT BUSINESS SECTORS HAVE VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS WHAT'S A BIG ISSUE TO A MASSAGE PARLOR MIGHT BE COMPLETE NON ISSUE TO A RESTAURANT. SO WHAT I'M HOPING TO DO IS TO FIND COMMONALITY IF NOT ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF SMALL BUSINESS AT LEAST FROM A LARGE BUSINESS SECTORS. AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT AT THE END OF THESE HEARINGS THAT MISS RANSOM MYSELF AND MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING TO BE. PAID IN THE NEXT HEARING. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION PERHAPS BASED ON WHAT WE HEAR OR AT THE VERY LEAST ARE MORE SENSITIVE I'M AS WE HEAR BILLS HONEST DIFFERENT ISSUES COME IN FRONT OF US. SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN TO ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M LOOK REYES TO SEE IF SHE HAS ANY OPENING COMMENTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH YOU IN GLENDALE I'VE HEARD ABOUT GLENDALE BECAUSE YOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SPEAKS OF GLENDALE ALL THE TIME AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER CITIES. IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF ARNOLD IS ALSO BURBANK LOCKING OUT AND LOS ANGELES [INAUDIBLE] VERY. YEAH THE FORMER MAYOR STORES I WAS [INAUDIBLE] SEE. THE PHOTO OF MY COLLEAGUE THERE. SMALL BUSINESS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ARE SO IMPORTANT IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO IMPORTANT. A THAT I WAS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AYE -- WAS LIGHTS CAME OUT AS AN ATTORNEY I JOIN THE LAW FIRM AND THEN WENT OUT ON MY OWN AND FOUND OUT THAT. WHEN I OPENED MY OFFICE I WAS THE FIRST LATINA EVER TO OPEN UP A SMALL BUSINESS IN THE ENTIRE INLAND EMPIRE SOMEBODY DEAN ON RIVERSIDE COUNTIES? AND I WAS SO PRACTITIONER FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SO I KNEW WHAT EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT'S A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. AS THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS SAID TO WHAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO ONE SEGMENT OF SMALL BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE IMPORTANT TO ANOTHER SEGMENT. BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT -- THAT ARE COMMON TO ALL OF US AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS [INAUDIBLE] I WE OFTEN HEAR THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN. THE MOST POWERFUL GENERATOR OF NEW JOBS HISTORICALLY. I THINK UP ONE OF THINGS THAT THAT THE ONE OF THE QUOTES THAT I HAVE -- HEARD THAT I REALLY LIKE IS THE FACT THAT START UP COMPANIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL NET JOB CREATION DURING MOST YEARS. ALL NET JOB CREATIONS AND THAT'S ACCORDING TO KAUFFMAN FOUNDATION IN THEIR REPORT THE IMPORTANCE OF START UPS. JOB CREATION AND JOB DESTRUCTION. SO I'M HERE TO LEARN SO THAT I CAN BRING THIS INFORMATION BACK TO MY COMMUNITY THE FORTY SEVENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH IS ENTIRELY. WITHIN STANFORD TO DO YOU KNOW COUNTY -- SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION NAM LOOKED LOOKING FORWARD TO AT ALL THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR. THE THINGS I WILL SAY IT'S CRITTENDEN NICE TO BE BACK IN THE GLENDALE CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS IT FEELS. LIKE COMING HOME THIS I WANT TO THANK THE CITY OF GLENDALE FOR ALLOWING US TO USE THEIR COUNCIL CHAMBERS AND FOR BEING GREAT PARTNERS WITH MY OFFICE FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR SPEAKERS AND AND NUMBER FINISH WITH OUR SET SPEAKERS ON THE AGENDA WE WILL HAVE A BRIEF PRAYER PUBLIC COMMENTARY. FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE -- OUR FIRST SPEAKER -- WHO WILL BE SPEAKING ON THE TOPIC OF ISSUES FACING CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESSES JUST A TOURIST THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT [INAUDIBLE] YOUR TAURUS.

SOME ARE PERMITS RELEASE A SMALL BUSINESS AND SOME THE ISSUES ARE SAYING OR SEEN AND HOW WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS THOSE -- SO LET'S. I'D SO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS THAT I DEVELOPMENT WE SERVICES THESE LEAD ENTITY WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT JOB CREATION OF LARGE. OUT WE HAVE A NUMBER TO VENUS YOU'LL SEE HERE ON THE SCREEN. CAN I WOULD SAY THAT I A FEW THEM A MUCH MORE HIGH PROFILE THAN OTHERS AND I YOU KNOW I WON'T GO THROUGH. EVERY SINGLE UNIT -- PITCHED ONE HIGHLIGHT IF YOU SO PRICE ON THE MORE I WAS A PROLIFIC UNITS YOU MAY BE AWARE OF OUR FOLKS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION -- WHICH RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF THE FILM. THE PRODUCTION IS COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA -- THE CALVARY COMPETE SKINNER PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN RE AUTHORIZED FOR THEIR FIVE YEARS THAT MANY. A MEASURE THAT THE PROGRAM -- OF VISIT CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA CHILD TRAVEL AND TOURISM BOARD -- AND THEN I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE OTHERS THEIR PRE I CAN OVER BEHIND [INAUDIBLE] SMALL. A LARGE FOR EXAMPLE OUR BUSINESS IS BUSINESS SERVICES TEAM THERE AT THE TOP -- WHICH WORKS BEHIND THE SCENES CONFIDENTIALLY WITH COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON AND OTHERS AS THEY DO YOU OF THE SITE LOCATION SERVICE IS TRYING TO IDENTIFY INCENTIVES THAT KEEP THEM HERE CALIFORNIA. OR I WERE WE COMPETE WITH OTHER STATES FOR FOR BUSINESSES -- AND ALSO THE FOLKS LIKE THE PERMANENCE IS THIS UNIT AND ALSO EVEN MY OWN OFFICE A SMALL BUSINESSES XENA WHERE WE DO A LOT OF DIRECT HANDS ON ONE ON ONE WORD. NOW WITH BUSINESS OWNERS AND LARGE THAT THE STATE NOT THINGS LIKE -- REGULATORY ASSISTANCE. HOW GENERAL SMALL BUSINESS ISSUES ETCETERA AND LOOK A LOT MORE FURTHER INTO THAT? I'M THIS IS MY OFFICE IS SO MICHAEL IS POSITIONS WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER UNITS AND THAT I SERVICE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION CARGO BAYS BUT ALSO HOW THE TITLE. OF PRINCIPLES THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE ECONOMICALLY CITY CALIFORNIA -- YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENCE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S THE STATUE LANGUAGE AROUND THE OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE. NEARLY JULES DOWN TO FOUR CORE ACTIVITIES SO THERE'S ADVOCACY. INFORMATION GATHERING DISSEMINATION AGENCY COORDINATION AND THE GENERAL PURPOSES -- ADVOCACY IN THE FORM OF PROVIDING INFORMATION DATA CAN BE HELPFUL AS POLICIES ARE BEING ARRIVE THAT'S OR EVEN -- FOR FOLKS THAT ARE REALLY TO UNDERSTAND OKAY WHAT IS THIS NEW REGULATION MEAN TO ME IN MY BUSINESS WE OFTEN GET ENGAGED IN THAT KIND OF WORK -- ATTRACTED BY A SECRET NATION NEXT AGES CORONATION APPARENTLY AREA ABOUT PROCUREMENT YOU KNOW I STATE CONTRACTS ARE BEING ASIDE OUT THERE -- YOU KNOW. FOR ALL THOSE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES OFTEN THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SMALL BUSINESS LIAISON THERE IS ESSENTIALLY A DOT A LINE TO MY OFFICE IN SO THAT. IF EVER BUSINESS HAS AN ISSUE AND SAY -- PUT IN A BID FOR SOME CONTRACT OR MAYBE THIS NEW SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM THAT IS EMERGENCY CALTRANS FOR OTHER AGENCIES -- THEY CAN CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE IN TRYING -- GERALD THIS ASSISTANCE -- WHICH IS THE DIRECT ONE ON ONE FIELD WORK AND THEN THAT SECOND BULLET THERE INFORMATION GATHERING DISSEMINATION WHICH I WOULD CHECK WITH SAME. IT'S LIKE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE AND WORK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEES OF CALIFORNIA. IS HOW DO YOU GET GREAT INFORMATION HOW TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. CONCERNED THE BREADTH OF OUR STATE CONSTRAINED THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE COMMUNICATE HOW THE CAN INFORMATION -- SO YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU GET. THE SOURCE THE COUNTRY BANDS -- HIGH YOU KNOW WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS USING A WILL WE TRY TO DO IS IDENTIFY WHO ARE THE CHAMPIONS OF TO CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT CAN HELP US GET THE INFORMATION OUT. ABOUT A REAL THAT'S NOT THIS IS PROGRAMS OR EVEN JUST THE MEDIA THE PLATFORMS BY WHICH WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THEM -- TO GET OUT RELEVANT INFORMATION. AND THAT JUST ON THE RIGHT YOU'LL SEE THERE ARE A FEW KEY INITIATIVES -- THAT'LL A TOUCH ON JUST A FEW THEM AS PART MY PRESENTATION -- BUT WE COVER A PRETTY WIDE GAMUT UNDERNEATH MY OFFICE -- YOU KNOW MANY OF THOSE ARE NOW GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW -- OVERSEE -- SUMMER STATE HAS SOME ARE FAIRLY FUNDED A BUT ALL ALL DIVE INTO. SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT MY DECK. BUT I THOUGHT I START PERSON JUST ON STATS AND I YOU KNOW JUST A KEY RESOURCE THAT WE USE THE U. S. US SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DOES COME OUT WHAT THE STATE PROFILE EVERY YEAR -- THIS IS THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION -- I CALIFORNIA'S THE MOST SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN THIS IN THE COUNTRY AT THREE POINT NINE MILLION AT LAST COUNT WE OUTPACED THE OTHER. A SEAT LARGER STATES HAVE AT LEAST A MILLION -- THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT PLAYER HERE IN THE STATES IN THE EMPLOY ABOUT SEVEN MILLION WORKERS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT UNDER 50%. OF EMPLOYEES AND I WE ALSO DO YOU RELY QUITE A BIT IN THE COFFIN FOUNDATION INFORMATION. IT WILL BE THE LAST -- REPORT THAT CAME OUT AROUND START UPS INNOVATION AT WHICH I DO NOT HAVE YOUR THE SCREEN IS THAT THEY SAID THAT CALIFORNIA'S AMONGST OF FIVE OTHER STATES THAT LEAD IN THE AREA OF THE RECENTLY RETIRED INDIVIDUALS THEIR SON THE COMING. THE FIRST TIME AND ALSO ABOUT WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES AND I'M HAPPY TO GO BACK AND SEE IF THEY HAVE ISSUED THEIR LATEST RECORD WHICH MIGHT HAVE. A DATE FOR MISSION BOYS THINK THAT'S ONLY PART TO KNOW THAT RETIREES AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES ARE. YOU KNOW SAY IT AS THEY RISE TO HELP BRING A DEAL LIKE THE RISE IN ANTI [INAUDIBLE] STATES I TRIED TO WATCH. MOLPUS ISSUES THAT WE LOOK TO ADDRESS -- I WAS THE FIRST IS AROUND THE IDEA PERSONALIZED BUSINESS SUPPORT. AND HOW DO WE SCALE THAT KIND SUPPORT -- NOW IF YOU KNOW IT IT WOULD SAY THAT THAT THAT MIGHT BE MY OWN PERSONAL BIAS HAVING BEEN FORMALLY A REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE LOS ANGELES SMALL THIS IS AN ALL STAR NETWORK. AND ALSO THE STATE'S SHARE ONE POINT FOR THE STATE PROGRAM. BUT I WOULD SAY ONE KEY ISSUE YOU SEE IS THAT YOU HAVE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS LOOKING TO TO SOLVE PROBLEMS FOR THAT THAT'S A PERMIT ISSUE AT A LOCAL LEVEL. I TRY TO ACCESS CAPITAL JUST TO KNOW HOW TO HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT WORLD. OR AYE IT COULD BE ANY ANY KIND AS IT IS ON A HIGHER FOR THE FIRST TIME I JUST DON'T HAVE A SINCE THE HOW TO DO THAT ANYMORE BECAUSE OF PAN OF WAY. AND THERE'S THE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS NEED TO PROVIDE. THAT INDIVIDUALIZE SHIP. TRAINING THAT CAN HELP THEM ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND YOU KNOW I SEE THAT AS FAR AS A KEY PROGRAMMER KEY FUNCTION THAT THE STATE COULD USE HOW DO YOU HELP SUPPORT THAT HE SOLD SUPPORT THOSE ENTITIES THAT. CAN HELP BUSINESS OWNERS ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES. THE OTHER TWO ITEMS THAT HAVE THAT THERE IS YOU KNOW I ACCESS TO CAPITAL WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- AT THE TOP ISSUE YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU GET THE COUPLE YOU TOUCH GET YOUR BUSINESS GOING THAT'S BEEN. YOU KNOW IT IT IN ANY KIND RICARDO WAS HE ACCESS COUPLE THERE AT THE TOP PROBABLY SECOND WOULD BE -- HIRING FOR THE FIRST TIME FUNDING GOING TO PLEASE BUT ACCESS COUPLES LEASE BEEN ISSUE. ASSISTING CALIFORNIA WERE ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE THE SORT OF SEE HOW THE BALLOT DEATH NOW YOU KNOW VERY CHALLENGING FOR FOLKS TO FIND FUNDING -- UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS TO JUST I'M GOING OFF IN THE RELY ON A FRIEND THE FAMILY. AND THEN I I KNEW ISSUE EMERGING ISSUE -- TO ME NOT SO NEW ANYMORE BUT JUST DOUBLY SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO RAISE TO YOUR ATTENTION. BECAUSE WE DON'T FULLY BELIEVE THAT THIS DESERVES -- IN A STRONG ATTENTION IS CYBERSECURITY -- AS DESIGNERS NOW -- EXPERIENCE THINGS LIKE AROUND SOMEWHERE. POINT IS STILL SYSTEM ISSUES -- GENERAL OF GENERAL TAX FROM ALL DIFFERENT TYPES IN THE VARIOUS EACH. PARTNERS OR ENTITIES AYE THIS IS BECOMING A A LOOMING ISSUE AND FRANKLY I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO ADDRESS IT THAT HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH. ACTIVITY -- TO REALLY ADDRESS THAT I'D A SMALL BUSINESS LEVEL ONLY IF YOU LOOK AT THAT PART HOMELESS SECURITY. THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY A DECK OF HEIDI MEDICAID SEPARATE SCOOTER RISK. IT'S EXCITING EIGHTY PAGE POWERPOINT TEMPLATE THAT NOBODY'S GONNA READ AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE HELP GET COULD FROM. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS -- JUST IN THE SAME WAY WE ADDRESS -- EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND IT WILL TAKE A LOOK THEY'LL TALK WITH THEM ABOUT HOW WE'RE LOOKING SHOULD JUST AT THE GOBIZ SIDE. SO LET'S TALK FIRST ABOUT HOWARD JUST SEEN -- STEALING SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT ONE ON ONE SUPPORT -- HER VERY PLEASED TO SHARE THAT AS PART OF THE THE RECENT PAST BUDGET WITH THEIR WE HAVE NOW TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR -- TO HELP EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF THE FEDERAL SMALL BUSINESS PARTNERS -- SO THIS INCLUDES THE THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS THE MINORITY BUSINESS THEIR OWN SENATORS THE VETERANS THIS.

ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS BESIDES SPDC IN THE MANUFACTURING CENTER. PROGRAM TO PROVIDE CRITICAL MATCH FUNDING TOWARDS THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS -- YOU KNOW TO GIVE A SENSE. OF THE SCOPE CURRENTLY. OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT ELIGIBLE CENTERS AND THESE ARE THAT THAT WAS A THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF FEDERAL BOB PROGRAM SUFFERING FROM THE STATE. YOU HAVE SEVENTY TWO CENTERS -- SCATTERED ACROSS THE STATE AT A DOING GREAT WORK -- OVER HOPING IS THAT THIS MONEY CAN HELP THEM EXPAND OUR FOOTPRINT -- TO A MUCH LARGER DECREED THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE -- SUCH A CALIFORNIA NOR STATES OF RURAL AREAS AL GORE WERE TRYING TO DISPLAY HER STAND.

THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM MY NEED A WEBSITE TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT SOCIAL MEDIA ACCESS YOU COMPETITORS POSTING ALL THE TIME. WE KNOW WE NEED TO BE THERE TOO AND SO WE DO QUITE A BIT ON BUILDING STRATEGIES AROUND US THAT. RATHER THAN JUST -- PURGING BUSINESSES TO DO ONE OFF ACTIVITIES WE LIKE TO HELP THEM SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH THEIR BUSINESS. AND REALLY PLAY STRATEGY -- IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE MOST OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES OF FACING -- ONE OF THE BIGGEST IS ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR MAJOR GOALS -- ASSOCIATED WITH. YES BE A GRAMM WE RECEIVED ON THE FEDERAL SIDE AS WELL AS ONE OF THE MAJOR ACTIVITY. CORD WITH THE GLOBUS GRANDSON ON THE STATE SIDE. AND THAT'S OFTENTIMES IS HELPING BUSINESSES NAVIGATE -- WHAT MIGHT BE THE BETTER BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR FUNDING HOW TO GET THEIR FINANCES IN ORDER HOW TO ACTUALLY PACKAGE -- THEIR THEIR DOCUMENTS IN. WE ONLY GO SHOP ALONE -- IN OUR NETWORK WE'VE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED A WHOLE TEAM THAT JUST DOES THIS IT'S CALLED THE ACCESS TO CAPITAL TEAM. IN THEIR OWN CALLS BASICALLY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO WORK WITH A SMALL BUSINESS THAT MIGHT NEED TO NAVIGATE FUNDING -- AND YOU NEED CONTACTS WITH BANKS MIGHT NEED TO GET THEIR FINANCES IN ORDER MAY NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR CREDIT SCORES WE CAN HELP NAVIGATE ALL OF THAT. AND WE HAVE THE LUCKY POSITION OF BEING AGNOSTIC ON THE LANDING OPPORTUNITY MIGHT BE THROUGH. WE'VE WE'VE REALLY THERE ON THE SIDE OF THE CLIENTS. TO GIVE THEM THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE TO MOVE THEIR BUSINESS FORWARD. GROWING HOPEFULLY AT JOBS IN. DEVELOPMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY -- OF FINANCIAL LITERACY WE FIND IS ALSO A BIG STRUGGLE SO A NUMBER OF OUR TRAININGS AND ADVISING FOLKS ON THIS -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CLIENTS WHO COME TO US -- AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN SURE IF THEY'RE PROFITABLE. SO THEY'RE SO BUSY RUNNING THE DAY TO DAY BUSINESS THAT THE TIME TO REALLY DIG IN AND LEARN EVERYTHING [INAUDIBLE] TO WE'RE ALL THOSE HATS THAT A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER NEEDS TO WEAR SO WE REALLY HOPE HE'S THAT APART AND DISTILL IT DOWN TO AN APPROACH THAT. REALLY GIVES A SMALL BUSINESS IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY'RE DOING AND WHERE THEY CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN. SHE GOT EFFICIENCY -- WE'LL SO I ENCOUNTER. A LOT OF BUSINESSES WHO ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE ARE PERMITTING PROCESS. YOU MENTIONED -- THE THE CITY YOU KNOW HAS A DIFFERENT PROCESS AND CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING WE FIND THAT A LOT OF THE CITIES WE SERVE WITHIN OUR REGION. THAT'S APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY AIDS JUST AND ONLY ALLOW -- THEY'LL HAVE -- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PROCESS SEES THEY MIGHT BE UNDERSTAFFED THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES. SO WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING DESERVE CITIES DIRECTLY. TO HELP LEARN THEIR PROCESS SEIZE AND THEN BE ABLE TO CONVEY THAT TO THE CLIENTS THAT WE MIGHT REPRESENT THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO TELL THE CITY HOW TO DO IT BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARNED. THEY APPROACH IT SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION GETS DOWN TO THE BUSINESS -- WE CAN EVEN HELP HAND HOLD THAT BUSINESS THROUGH THE PROCESS. SO WERE WERE THINK THINKING OF OUR CLIENTS BEYOND JUST THE SMALL BUSINESS ITSELF. AND ACTUALLY ENGAGING CITIES AND COMMUNITIES IN OUR AREA TO SORT OF BE THAT GO BETWEEN HELP OF THIS IS NOW TO GET ALL THAT -- WE'RE ALSO SEEING A LOT OF PRESSURE ON A RETAILER SERVE OUR BRICK AND MORTAR. MANY SENSE IS A PERFECT STORM -- WE'RE SEEING ARE RAPIDLY INCREASING OF RENTS. IN OUR REGION ALONG WITH. HOUSING AND ALL THAT THERE'S JUST A LOT OF PRESSURE ON SPACE -- WERE SEEING RISING EMPLOYEE BECAUSE THINGS LIKE -- THE MINIMUM MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS AND EVERYTHING. WHILE THAT MAY BE A GREAT THING FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE FOR THAT SMALL BUSINESS. ONE THEY MAY NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED ARE NOW HAVING TO REACT -- TO GROSSES SEEM QUITE A BIT OF COMPETITION. IN THE ONLINE SPACE. SO ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE REALLY IMPACTING OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW HAVE THOSE EXPERTS ON HAND. OUR VISORS. WE HAVE AGE OUR EXPERTISE SURVEYING. STAND YOU COMMERCE AND HELP THOSE BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN MAYBE THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY MAY HAVE TRADITIONALLY. IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THESE NEW CHALLENGES THEY MAY NOT A FACED OVER THERE HAS -- AS I MENTIONED WE WE DEAL WITH QUITE A BIT OF MARKETING ISSUE SO THIS IS ONE AREA THAT -- YOUR TYPICAL SMALL BUSINESS. MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD AN OUTSIDE AGENCY OR THE LUXURY OF HAVING A MARKETING DEPARTMENT TERMINALLY. SO WE PROVIDES -- SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPERTS THROUGHOUT OUR NETWORK TO WORK WITH THIS. WHAT I WANT -- AND WE MAY EVEN TO PLAY WHOLE TEAM TO A BUSINESS SO THAT THEY GET EXPERT. WEBSITE IF YOU COMMERCE. BRANDING IN ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AND REALLY. ARE TRYING TO MAKE THOSE SMALL WHOSE [INAUDIBLE] EXPERTS WHEN THEY ARE GOING OUT TO MARKET AND MAYBE WHEN THEY DO WORK WITH THE VENDOR. THEY KNOW THE QUESTIONS TO ASK. SO THEY CAN. FEEL COMFORTABLE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- HR AND HEALTH CARE HAS BECOME A BIG ISSUE AND YOUR REGULATIONS TO SEEMS SHIFT PRETTY RAPIDLY AND THAT'S A LOT FOR A SMALL BUSINESS KEEP UP WITH. SO WE OFFERED A NUMBER OF WORKSHOPS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR JUST THROUGH. PEOPLE ABREAST OF THE CHANGES WE ALSO OFFER ONE ONE ADVISING. TO ANYBODY WHO'S RUNNING INTO ISSUES AND JUST EVEN THROUGH OUR OR COMMUNICATIONS THESE LETTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WERE MAKING SURE TO POPULATE THAT WITH UPCOMING ISSUES. SO THIS SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION SO WE STILL. TRIES TO REMAIN TOP OF MIND -- THEN THE AS IS MR TOWARDS POINTED OUT. CYBERSECURITY WE THINK IS IS ALSO A PRETTY BIG THREAT TO SMALL BUSINESS. WE FIELDED SOME CALLS HERE AND THERE WITH -- COME FACING ATTACKS ON THEIR WEBSITE -- BUT WE DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A REALLY GREAT SORT OF HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SO. PART OF OUR PROPOSAL I'M TO SOME OF THAT STATE FUNDING AND YOU'RE WITH THIS YEAR'S FEDERAL GRANT. WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING MORE ON EVER CYBERSECURITY OFFERINGS DOING WORKSHOPS PARTNERING WITH OTHER AGENCIES THAT MAY HAVE SOME DEATH IN THIS. AND THEN BRING TO OUR SMALL. SO THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL OF THE CHALLENGES [INAUDIBLE] OUR SMALL. THAT ARE. OPEN FOR QUESTIONS [INAUDIBLE] SOME MEMBERS. THANK YOU -- YOU THE ONE OF THE LESSONS YOU TALKED ABOUT REGARDING MARKETING. YOU SAID YOU'RE DEPLOYED EXPERTS AS A TEAM TO GO TO THE BUSINESS. FREE SERVICE YES -- CITY SBDC SERVICES ARE FREE TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS -- IMPORTANT WERE NOT ACTUALLY EFFORTS IT'S WE WOULDN'T BUILD THEIR WEBSITE FOR THEM BUT WE TEACH THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO ASK FOR HOW TO MAKE THAT COMPLEMENT. YOU KNOW THE REST OF THEIR MARKETING STRATEGIES THAT WILL WORK ON WITH [INAUDIBLE] AND WELL WORST NETWORK CERTAINLY HAS SOME GENERALIST THAT CAN WORK WITH ANY BUSINESS. WE FUNDED SOCIAL VALUE BUT HAVE PEOPLE WITH SPECIFIC INDUSTRY. OR SKILL EXPERTISE SO SMALL BUSINESS MAY HAVE A GENERAL US WORKING WITH THEM ON A NUMBER OF THINGS. THEN WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THEIR MARKETING WE MAY PULL EN. ECOMMERCE EXPERT AT WEB EXPERT YOU KNOW SORT OF A TEAM WE CAN DRAW FROM THROUGHOUT OUR NETWORK. ROUGHLY HONOR FIFTEEN VISORS. TO HELP YOU KNOW BASICALLY GIVE THE BEST ADVICE TO THAT BUSINESS PROVIDE. IT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE THE LOS ANGELES SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER I WOULD ASSUME PACKED IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THINK IT'S RIVERSIDE THAT HOUSE. ONE PARENT SAID THAT WOULD BE THROUGH ORANGE COUNTY INLAND EMPIRE -- AND SO I HAVE A COUNTERPART MY DANIEL WHO. RUNS THAT REGION THERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT'S AND DIEGO AREA. AND THEN THE CENTRAL COAST AND THEN NORTH. SO WERE BROKEN INTO REGIONS SPEZZA. WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WE MEET MONTHLY. TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN. YEAH BOTH LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER BUT ALSO BRING THESE SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE FACED THINGS LIKE -- STATEWIDE NATURAL DISASTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING -- WHERE WOULD THEY? WOULD SPEAK THAT WEBSITE TO THE THAT THEY WOULD GO TO TO HAVE ACCESS. TO FIND OUT THE CLOSEST -- SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER -- IT SAYS SMALL BIZ LA DOT ORG. WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE TO GET STARTED. AND THE LAST QUESTION IS THIS ACCESS TO CAPITAL TEAM. IF SOMEBODY COMES IN AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS TO HAVE ACCESS CAPITAL THEN YOU PUT THE TEAM ON TO HELP THEM. FIGURE OUT TO NAVIGATE -- TO YEAH SO I THINK IT WILL -- WILL YOU ASK FOR THEIR FINANCIALS AND HELP GET THOSE IN ORDER -- WILL DEVELOP A SHORT BUSINESS PLAN FOR THEM WILL WILL ESSENTIALLY PACKAGE EVERYTHING TOGETHER. WITH AN EYE TOWARDS WHAT THE LENDERS. SOMETHING THAT A BUSINESS MIGHT HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND THAT WE DO AND WE WORK WITH THESE LETTERS ALL THE TIME AND HAVE A REALLY GOOD PULSE ON WHAT THEY NEED IN ORDER. TO ACTUALLY CONSIDER SMALL BUSINESS APPLICATION -- SO WE BASICALLY PUT THEM FORWARD ON THE BEST FOOTING POSSIBLE. DID I KNOW THAT THERE'S LOTS THAT'S DOWN TOWARD THE BIGGER SMALL BUSINESSES. IS THERE IS THERE SOMEBODY WHO IS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT THAT IS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESSES THOSE WHO HAVE LESS THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES. THOSE WITH THE WITH. SMALLER BUSINESSES WE CONSIDER THEM ALL OUR CLIENTS SO WE HAVE NOT SEGREGATED THAT WAY I WILL SEGREGATE ACCORDING. TO INDUSTRIES SO IF IT'S A RETAILER WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN EXPERT IN THAT AREA. THIS IS A MAN FACTURE -- BUT I'D SAY MOST OF OUR CLIENTELE COMES FROM. WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO IN TERMS OF? SMALLER AND OF THAT SPECTRUM A SMALL DOES. WE WORKED WITH A LOT OF RESTAURANTS A MOM AND POP RETAILERS -- YEAH WE'RE SO FOCUSED ON STARTUPS SO THAT MIGHT BE A REALLY SMALL TEAM TO BEGIN WITH THAT'S LOOKING TO GROW. AND WE HOPE TO STAY WITH THEM OVER YOU KNOW THEIR EVOLUTION INTO. THE BIGGER AND THAT'S WHAT IS THEIR COMMITMENT TO YOU. FOR YOU TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO THEM WHAT IS THEIR COMMITMENT THE THEY SUCH WE NEED TO FILL OUT A LITTLE BIT OF PAPERWORK -- ALTHOUGH SHOULD MENTION PEOPLE THAT CONFIDENTIAL WELL WE ARE FEDERALLY FUNDED SO I'M NOT OF THAT IS SHARED BEYOND OUR OUR CENTER WE HAVE. PERRY TERROR DATABASE WE PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF ORGANIZATION [INAUDIBLE] IN AGGREGATE -- SO YOU MIGHT BILL TO GET DATA MEMBERS WOULD YOU WANT NOTABLY THE BUSINESSES BEHIND THAT UNLESS THEY'VE ELECTED. TO BECOME A SUCCESS STORY OR LOUDEST BRAG ABOUT THEM. THAT SAID THEY JUST NEED TO MEET WITH US AND THEN I RECEIVED ONGOING THEY NEED. TO ACTUALLY. DOING THE WORK TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS. WE CAN DO FOR THEM BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY EMPOWER THEM -- TO ADDRESS WHATEVER ISSUES THEY MIGHT BE. THANK YOU THANK YOU HUNTER. THANK YOU COMMA I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE ANSWERS FOR BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE -- TOPICAL HERE IN THE AREA. THE FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH. THE PRICE OF COMMERCIAL RENTS. WHICH IS A PROBLEM ACROSS THE DISTRICT. IS A PROBLEM FOR THE RENTS FOR THE EMPLOYEES BUT IT'S ALSO A PROBLEM FOR THE REST OF THE BUSINESS. AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS QUITE A LOT IN BURBANK IN AN AREA CALLED MAGNOLIA PARK. WITH SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ASKING FOR COMMERCIAL RENT CONTROL. WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THIS AND MAKE A PART OF THE SAME ISSUE OPEN MONTROSE NEAR HERE WHERE. THE OLDER BUILDINGS ARE TURNING OVER THE PERRANCE ART PASSING THE BUSINESS THOUGH THE BUILDINGS. TO THE CHILDREN WHO. REALLY MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH OF AN INTEREST OR ONE TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFIT YOU KNOW ICE IS THEIR RIGHT. BUT THEN THE SMALL MOM AND POPS THAT ARE REALLY MOM AND POPS AN INDEPENDENT SHOPS AND STORES AND RESTAURANTS JUST CAN'T. POSSIBLY PAY THE RENT. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY STRATEGIES THAT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER AREAS IT EITHER. THE SHOPPING PARKS THEMSELVES HAVE EMPLOYED BECAUSE BOTH OF THESE I BELIEVE HAVE SHOPPING PARK ASSOCIATIONS I'M NOT SURE ABOUT BURBANK IN THAT CASE BUT MONTROSE DOES. OR THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES OR AT THE CITY LEVEL HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING -- THAT YOU FEEL HAS BEEN KIND OF THE THE WAY TO HANDLE THIS. YEAH I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING VERY COMPREHENSIVE -- WE TEND TO DEAL ON THE INDIVIDUAL CLIENT LEVEL. AND SO -- IN THAT CASE YOU KNOW WE'RE HELPING THEM AGO SHE'D THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLY GET -- OR MAYBE HELPING THEM. IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVES THEY HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF BEFORE -- BUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW MORE LIKE ALMOST. PLANNING APPROACH WE HAVE NOTS. REALLY WAIT INTO THAT SPACE -- AND THEN SECONDLY IN THE SAME VEIN. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY STRATEGIES FOR THE BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES THAT ARE FEELING THE CROWD UP FROM ONLINE BUSINESSES. THAT YOU THINK A SUCCESSFUL ARE THERE CERTAIN TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE FOUND WAYS TO ADAPT -- THAT YOU WOULD THAT YOU TYPICALLY RECOMMEND TO YOUR MUSIC SHOP YOUR CLOTHING RETAILER YOUR BOUTIQUE. ALL OF THOSE SORTS OF BRICK AND MORTAR SUTTER ARE FEELING THE EFFECTS OF THE ON LINE. GIANTS OUT THERE WILL HAVE A SAY THE FIRST THING WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO JUMP INTO THAT POOL AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A STRONG. PRESENCE AS WELL. AND MAYBE THINK ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY MAY HAVE. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE SPACE THERE'S WELL -- THE OTHER THING I THINK WE'RE SEEING MORE OF A WOULD BE. POP UPS IN SHARED SPACE OPPORTUNITIES THINGS LIKE THAT SO LOOKING AT YOUR SPACE MORE EFFICIENT [INAUDIBLE] RECENTLY THAT. MAYBE THEY WERE FORCED TO IN THE PAST AND PARTNER WITH OTHER BRANDS. REALLY SORT OF MAXIMIZING EXPERIENCE TO THEIR CLIENTELE VERSES. JUST HOPING THAT THEY SHOW FOR YOUR ONE OFFER. YEAH I'M GLAD THAT YOU SAID TO MAXIMIZE THE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE JUST ANECDOTALLY AS I'VE TRAVELED THROUGH THE SPACE AND HARPER BUSINESSES. IT SEEMS A THE SHIFT TO OFFERING EXPERIENCES THAT YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH ONLINE SHOPPING. I'M WITH HIGH BOOKSTORES TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'VE BECOME ANCHORS YOU KNOW IN AN AGE WITH LONG PEOPLE CAN BUY ANY BOOK THROUGH AMAZON BUT THAT THEY BECOME ANCHORS. AND THEIR SHOPPING PARKS BECAUSE THEY OFFER A LOT OF PROGRAMMING -- AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIALIZING AND IT CHANGED A LITTLE BIT FROM JUST BEING A PLACE YOU CAN WILL BUY BOOKS TO BE A PLACE FOR PEOPLE WANT TO GO BECAUSE THERE'S AUTHORS AND READINGS AND PANEL DISCUSSIONS AND THAT SORT OF THING AND AND TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY I'M ALSO MAYBE. GOTTEN BETTER RENT DEALS BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE A DRAW FOR THE OTHER BUSINESS. I'M GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT UP. I THINK YOU I HOPE THAT YOU CAN AS WELL CAN STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT SECTION WHICH IS FOSTERING INNOVATION IN INCUBATORS. AND TO ADDRESS US ON THAT WE HAVE SANTEE WEBER WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FROM GOLDMAN SACHS -- ONE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES. THANK YOU SHINING. GOOD MORNING SIMPLY MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AND RADIUS THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVITATION HERE TODAY THIS MORNING. BECAUSE YOU ABOUT THE GOLDMAN SACHS TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES PROGRAM AND ALSO TO DISCUSS GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. MY NAME IS JENNY WEBER AND I'M THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR COLLEGE ADVANCEMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AT LONG BEACH CA ME BECAUSE DISTRICT. AND I OVERSEE THE ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE -- DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AT THE COLLEGE WHICH ALSO INCLUDES A LOS ANGELES ALONE ALLEY SBDC NETWORK THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM. AND AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE GOLDMAN SACHS TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES SITE -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR PARTNERS AT ELLIE CITY COLLEGE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES PROGRAM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SHARE WITH YOU SOME PROGRAM RESULTS. SO THE PROGRAM WAS LAUNCHED IN -- TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES IS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION INITIATIVE THAT'S FUNDED BY THE GOLDMAN SACHS FOUNDATION. TO UNLOCK THE GROWTH AND JOB CREATION POTENTIAL OF TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THROUGH GREATER ACCESS TO BUSINESS EDUCATION MENTORS AND NETWORKS AND FINANCIAL CAPITAL. IT IS BASED ON THE BROADLY HELD VIEW THAT LEADING EXPERTS HAVE. THAT A COMBINATION OF EDUCATION CAPITAL AND SUPPORT SERVICES BEST ADDRESSES THE BARRIERS TO GROWTH FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. SO IMAGINE AN INTENSIVE EXECUTIVE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM. WITH A WORLD CLASS CURRICULUM THAT PROVIDES VERY PRACTICAL HANDS ON LEARNING USING A CASE STUDY FROM A REAL SMALL BUSINESS. IN A HIGHLY INTERACTIVE PEER LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. WITH INTENSIVE SUPPORT BY A TEAM OF FACULTY AND BUSINESS ADVISERS OVER A FOUR MONTH PERIOD. THIS TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES PROGRAM IS ALL OF THAT AND IT'S DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESS UP OWNERS POISED FOR GROWTH. DOES IN THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED HOURS IN PERSON SESSIONS COVERING TOPICS FROM GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITIES TO MONEY AND METRICS. THEY ALSO LEARN ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND Y. CUP COMPANY CULTURE MATCHES -- MARKETING. OPERATIONS AND MORE SO THE HUNDRED HOURS DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE TIME THEY HAVE TO SPEND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM WORKING ON THEIR GROWTH PLAN WHICH IS WHAT THEY EMERGE WITH AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM. IT'S A VERY POWERFUL AND EFFECTIVE PROGRAM WHICH I DON'T NOT ONLY SEEN FIRST HAND -- YOU SEE A NINETY EIGHT POINT FIVE COMPLETION RATE WHICH SPEAKS TO HOW OF OF VALUABLE THE SMALL BUSINESSES FIND THIS PROGRAM AND IN FACT RECOGNIZE. A WHAT THEY'RE GETTING FROM THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM LONG TO SEE COLLEGE WAS LAUNCHED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TEN WORK BUT THE SECOND SIDE OF MOUNT FOURTEEN SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT OFFERS A VERY UNIQUE UP GROWTH PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. COMBINE DEL LA AND LONG BEACH SITES HAVE GRADUATED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WE CALL THEM SCHOLARS. WITH AGAIN A NINETY EIGHT POINT MENTIONED EARLIER. AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALSO BOASTS THE LARGEST ALUMNI GROUP. ACROSS THE NATION IN THIS PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM LOOKS FOR APPLICANTS WHO GENERALLY MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA WE LOOK FOR REVENUES GREATER THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR. A MINIMUM OF FOUR EMPLOYEES. YOU HAVE TO BE A CO OWNER OF OWNER Ó CO OWNER IN THE BUSINESS. AND HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. IN OUR MUCHO RECRUITMENT EFFORTS WERE VERY FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT WOMEN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THOSE IN THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE WELL REPRESENTED IN OUR COHORT. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT COHORT DIVERSE CITY BOTH IN INDUSTRIES AND PARTICIPANTS PROVIDER RICHER LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ALL OF THE SCHOLARS. SO YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHO ARE THESE TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS SCHOLARS SO PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SHARE SOME STATISTICS. THERE ENTREPRENEURS FROM ALL FIFTY STATES AND THESE ARE NATIONAL STATISTICS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEY REPRESENT TOTAL REVENUES OF OVER NINE BILLION. DOLLARS WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED BETWEEN ALL OF THESE BUSINESSES. THE PARTICIPANTS COVER ALL AGE RANGE FROM TWENTY TWO YEARS OF AGE TO SEVENTY NINE YEARS OF AGE. THEY HAVE EDUCATIONAL LEVELS FROM HIGH SCHOOL GED TO GRADUATE DEGREES. 45% OF THE PARTICIPANTS ARE WOMEN'S BUSINESS OWNERS. THE MEDIAN AGE EMPLOYEES AND REVENUES OF A BUSINESS IS TWELVE YEARS ELEVEN EMPLOYEES. AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND INVOLVING USE RESPECTIVELY. GROWTH IN REVENUE AND JOBS ARE KHIMETRICS USED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM SO IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PROGRESS REPORT REPORT THAT'S PUBLISHED BY BABSON COLLEGE. WHO ACTUALLY DESIGNED THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM AND IS A NATIONAL PROGRAM PARTNER AND THEIR? NUMBER ONE LEADING ENTREPRENEURSHIP COLLEGE IN THE COUNTRY AND RECOGNIZE INTERNATIONAL. THE DATA THAT WE COLLECTED FROM SIX THOUSAND PROGRAM GRADUATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY SHOW THAT THEY PROOF OUTPERFORM THEIR SMALL BUSINESS PEERS IN GROWING REVENUES AND CREATING JOB. HERE ARE SOME OF THE THE STATS I CAN SHARE WITH YOU. AFTER -- AT SIX MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING THE PROGRAM. 67% OF A OF A SCHOLARS HAVE INCREASED OUR REVENUE AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT COMPARING THEM TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF FORTY SEVEN PER. 47% HAVE CREATED JOBS. AND COULD THIS IS COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF TWENTY FIVE AT THIRTY MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING THE PROGRAM. 70% HAVE INCREASED THEIR REVENUES. AGAIN COMPARED TO THE 47% NATIONALLY AND THEN 57% HAVE CREATED JOBS. SO THE PARTISAN RESULTS CONSISTS ONLY SHOW THE POSITIVE FAN AND DURING A FACT THAT THE PROGRAM HAS ON THE ECONOMY. THERE IS HOWEVER A COPY OUT OF THIS -- VERY NEEDED AN EFFECT PROGRAM IN MY OPINION. IT IS NOT INEXPENSIVE TO DELIVER THIS PROGRAM -- AND DELIVER PROGRAM WAS SUCH HIGH QUALITY AND AND THANKS TO THE GENEROUS SUPPORT OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS FOUNDATION THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO OF COURSE PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM DO NOT HAVE TO PAY A DYING. SO THIS IT'S THEY RECEIVE A SCHOLARSHIP FROM GOLDMAN SACHS FOUNDATION -- MANY ALSO WONDER WHAT IS THE SECRET SAUCE TO THIS PROGRAM -- WITH GOLDMAN SACHS SUPPORT BABSON COLLEGE DESIGNED A CURRICULUM THAT IS HIGHLY SCALABLE. AND REALLY FOCUS ON FOUR KEY INGREDIENTS. WE FOCUS ON ENTREPRENEUR GROWTH AND JOB WE TEND. PEER TO PEER LEARNING WHERE PARTICIPANTS BRING THEIR CURRENT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES INTO THE CLASSROOM. AND THAT THEY CAN APPLY WHAT THEY LEARN IN CLASS IMMEDIATELY IN THE OF BUSINESS THE VERY NEXT DAY WE SEEN THIS HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE CURRICULUM IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED AND INTEGRATED WITH BUSINESS SUPPORT SERVICES AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL. THERE'S ALSO VERY VIGOROUS MEASURE ANY MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION SYSTEM IN PLACE TO TRACK AND MONITOR THE BUSINESS OWNERS. WE CONTINUE TO OUTREACH TO THEM AND STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM THROUGH THE ALUMNI PROGRAM. WE TEACH BUSINESS OWNERS TO BE EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT COMPELLING AND WE TEACH THEM TO WORK ON THEIR BUSINESS AND KNOCKING THE OF BUSINESS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES. AS YOU KNOW ASSEMBLYMAN AREIAS WHEN YOU. YOU CAN GET SUCKED INTO ALL THE MY NEW SHIFTED BUSINESS AND YOU STOP LOOKING ST SHE WORRIED AT AT YOUR BUSINESS SO THIS BUSINESS. UP TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES PROGRAM COVERS A LOT OF THINGS THAT -- REALLY IS NOT NECESSARY WHAT. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DON'T KNOW IT'S REALLY HELPING THEM LOOK AT THEIR BUSINESSES VERY DIFFERENTLY AND BY DOING THAT WITH THIS PROGRAM. WE REALLY HELP THE BUSINESSES GROW. IN LOOKING AT FOSTERING INNOVATION IN SMALL BUSINESSES -- AND INNOVATION IS A KEY THEME IN THE PROGRAM -- DATA SHOWS THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING THE PROGRAM OVER 75% OF OUR GRADUATES HAVE IMPROVED AN EXISTING PRODUCT OR SERVICE. OPENED A NEW LOCATION. AND OR HAVE AND LAUNCH A NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE SO THIS IS SOME OF THE REASONS WHY THEY GROW AND CREATE JOBS. WHAT ARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED -- WE COULD -- THAT WOULD HELP US APPROACH THE QUESTION OF HOW BEST TO FOSTER INNOVATION AND INCUBATE SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH. NUMBER ONE HAVING A GOOD PIPELINE IS IMPORTANT TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES RELY ON THE POOL OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS TO FILL A COHORTS. SO IN OTHER WORDS WE NEED A VERY STRONG PIPELINE OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. SO THE KEY TO A STRONG PIPELINE IN BUILDING -- TO HAVE OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IS REALLY BUILDING THE ENTREPRENEUR ECHOES. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE LARGER PICTURE PICTURE BECAUSE NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL IN THIS PROGRAM IS NOT. FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE GROWTH MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT BUSINESS OWNERS AND SOME BUSINESS OWNERS DO NOT WANT TO GROW. PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THE TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES PROGRAM WORKS. OUT WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS LIKE THAT IN THE PIPELINE PROGRAM SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO DON'T MEET THE CRITERIA OF THE TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS. THE MICHAEL BUSINESSES THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER -- THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE MORE FOCUS ON PROGRAMS LIKE THE TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES BUT DE SIGN. FOR THE MICHAEL BUSINESSES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY NEED TO HELP TO GET TO A CERTAIN LEVEL. PLEASE LOOK AT REMOVING BARRIERS -- ECONOMIC INCLUSION AND THEN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF RESOURCE PARTNERS -- HAVING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAW PARTNERSHIP WITH THE S. B. D. C. A. S. B. A A LOT OF CHAMBERS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AND LOTS OF OTHER PARTNERS MAKES A DIFFERENCE. THE OTHER QUESTION IS HOW CAN GOVERNMENT INCENTIVIZE A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH -- WITH EXISTING TECHNICALS PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT FUNDS HOW DO WE SET UP ENCOURAGE AND HELP THE CITIES TO STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE GET PLANNING PROCESS. AND A PERMITTING PROCESS -- MAKING IT MUCH SIMPLER FOR THOSE US STARTING A BUSINESS AND EVEN EXISTING BUSINESSES STRUGGLE WITH THOSE THE PERMITTING AND PROCESS WHEN THEY ARE. OPENING ANOTHER LOCATION AND OR THEY'RE TRYING TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS. WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW TO USE TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP BUSINESSES LEARN. SO SUCH AS INTERACTIVE ONLINE LEARNING BECAUSE TRAFFIC IS A REAL ISSUE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN LOOKING AT APPS THAT PROVIDE MEN CHEWING THAT CAN HELP AN INTRO ENTREPRENEUR OF THAT THEIR BUSINESS IDEA. TAKE THEM TO THE STEP BY STEP OF STARTING AND GROWING A BUSINESS. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BECAUSE ENTREPRENEURS DON'T SLEEP AND THE UP AND COMING A GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS AND FUTURE BUSINESS OWNERS OF VERY TECH SAVVY. CITIES ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT STRATEGIES TO BRING RESOURCE PARTNERS TOGETHER AND ENGAGE ENTREPRENEURS TO GROW THE ECO SYSTEM -- THE ECO SYSTEM GROWING ECO SYSTEM HAS TO BE DRIVEN BY ENTREPRENEURS. THE CITIES HAVE TO TAKE RISK AND PARTNER WITH ENTREPRENEURS IN WAYS THAT SERVES THE COMMUNITIES SO AN EXAMPLE IS THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. WHO IS CURRENTLY TESTING APPROACHES AND STRATEGIES AS PART OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BLUEPRINT? IN BUILDING ECO SYSTEM THEY'VE PARTNER WITH AN ENTREPRENEUR TO BUILT A CO WORKING SPACE. CITY OWNED PROPERTY FORM THAT WAS FORMALLY AN RTA PROPERTY WHICH ALSO OFF -- IS GOING TO OFFER ON THE TECHNICAL SMALL BUSINESS ON THE SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL SYSTEM NETWORK FORCE PROGRAMS THAT LUMBER CITY COLLEGE OFFERS. SO THE PAPER POP UP PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP IS VERY IMPORTANT -- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS NEW SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANT EXPANSION PROGRAM. THAT ADJUSTED TOYS MENTION EARLIER IS A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. LEVERAGING FEDERAL FUNDS TO INCREASE THAT CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE IN ASSISTING SMALL BUSINESSES. OF ALL LEVELS THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT I THINK BREAKTHROUGH FOR AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND AND I WANT -- TO RECOGNIZED JESSE TOURS HE WAS ACTUALLY VERY INSTRUMENTAL AND CHAMPIONING THIS PROGRAM BEHIND THE SCENES IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN. AND ALSO A VERY FAINT BECAUSE MY THANKS TO ADAM ASSEMBLYMEMBERS QUICKSILVER AND CERVANTES FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES VERY EXCITED. ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHAT ROLE CAN GOVERNMENT PLAY IN ENCOURAGING MORE INNOVATION. AND FINDING NEW WAYS OF GETTING FUNDING TO SMALL BUSINESSES THEIR PROGRAMS LIKE KIVA DOT COM THAT CAN HELP TO BUILD A SMALL OF BRAND NEW UN ENTREPRENEURS CREDIT SCORES AND AND REPUTATION. AND THEN OF FUND BOX WHICH WORKS TO GET. OF FUNDING TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS VERY QUICKLY -- AND THEN ENCOURAGING CITIES TO ENGAGE WITH THE KAUFMAN FOUNDATIONS MAYOR'S CONFERENCE ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER MAYORS WITH ENTREPRENEURS ECHOES. BUILDERS RESEARCHERS AND POLICY EXPERTS TO DISCOVER WAYS TO BUILD A MEASURE HEALTHY ENTREPRENEUR ECO SYSTEM -- WITH ENTREPRENEURSHIP AT IT AT AN ALL TIME LOW THIS ISSUES EVEN MORE URGENT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE OF THE U. S. EMPLOYER FIRMS -- LASTLY WHAT I WANT TO MENTION THE ISSUE OF WORKFORCE. OUT OF QUALIFY -- READY WORKFORCE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN WITHOUT SMALL BUSINESSES -- HIRING AND TRAINING QUALIFIED WORKERS UP. HAVING THEM OF FINDING THEM AND KEEPING THEM IT'S A BAKER VERY A TO THEIR GROWTH SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AN ADDRESS AND FINDING WAYS TO PARTNER WITH ALL. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND NOW EDUCATE [INAUDIBLE] TIONS AND ALSO THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO START ONLY. FEELING THAT PIPELINE. I WOULD LIKE TO END THIS REPORT FROM A QUOTE FROM THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN ON PARTNERSHIP THAT SUMS UP THE IMPORTANCE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN [INAUDIBLE] STATES. ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS CENTRAL TO THE AMERICAN IDENTITY. THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT ITSELF IS A PROFOUND ENTREPRENEUR I'M TO TAKE. GROUNDED IN THE FRONTIER SPIRIT OF FREEDOM ADVENTURE AND SELF RELIANCE AND A COMMITMENT. OUT DEMOCRATIC VALUES OFFENDERS AND COOPERATION. ENTREPRENEURS PAST AND PRESENT PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE IN OUR POPULAR CULTURE AND THE ABILITY TO STRIKE OUT ON ONE'S OWN IS WOVEN INTO OUR NATION'S SOCIAL FABRIC. IF WE'D LOSE THE CENTRAL. AND THIS AND YOU KNOW MY MY SENSE OF ALL OF THIS IS. IF WE LOSE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN IDENTITY TOO MANY COUNTRIES ONLY HOPE TO REPLICATE AND SOMEWHAT TRYING TO REPLICATE ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. WE LOSE OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE GLOBAL. SO THANK YOU. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. YOU CAN IS WEBER I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TALKING ABOUT -- WHAT YOU SEE IS SOME OF THE -- ROLES FOR GOVERNMENT -- IN THE FUNCTIONING OF SMALL BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURS THAT'S VERY HELPFUL FOR THE COMMITTEE -- I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR TALKING ABOUT ON THE CITY'S CITIES ROLE AS THE ONES WHO ARE DOING THE LOCAL PERMITTING. I WHEN I WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER GLENDALE WE SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME WORKING ON STREAMLINING OUR PRACTICES AND THROUGH OUR REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY. SET UP -- A CONCIERGE PROGRAM FOR BUSINESSES WANT TO OPEN IN THE CITY THAT WAS SIX SO SUCCESSFUL THE CITY SPREAD IT. ACROSS THE CITY OUT OF THE RDAS AND THEN CONTINUED IT BEYOND BILL LOSS OF RDAS. AND IT'S INTERESTING ALSO THAT YOU DIDN'T THE RDAS THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY. THEY DON'T EXIST NOW CALIFORNIA FORTUNE AND SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FOSTER THOSE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS -- AT A TIME WHEN A LOT OF CITIES FIND THEIR BUDGETS STRETCHED. AND SOMETIMES DON'T VALUE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ROLE WITHIN THEIR CITIES ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE SMALLER CITY OR DON'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO FUND THAT IS A REAL CHALLENGE FOR CITIES. AND WANTING IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW IF THERE IS A STATE ROLE. TO ASSIST THE CITY'S WITHOUT ROLE OR WHETHER IT'S REALLY INCUMBENT ON INDIVIDUAL CITIES. BASED ON THEIR OWN ECONOMY. THEIR OWN LOCATION TO KIND OF FIND THEIR WAY THEMSELVES -- AND MAYBE TRY TO EMPLOY THEIR CREATIVITY IF THEY'RE FINANCES AREN'T THEIR DEATH HIGHER AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TEAM IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT -- YES I DO SO THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING -- THING WITH A RESOLUTION OF THE RGA THAT A LOT OF CITY SIT ON PROPERTIES THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. BUT I I YOU KNOW HAVE BEING -- FROM A PUBLIC AGENCY IS WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS AND RESOURCES PUBLIC AGENCIES FROM CITIES HAVE. IN BUILDING OUT OF A LOT OF PROGRAMMING AND A FRIEND OFFERINGS OF THE COMMUNITIES ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I SEE. THAT -- I I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE MORE CITIES TO DO IS -- THE CITY OF LONG BEACH WAS PART OF THE BLOOMBERG'S A AWARD INNOVATION AWARD AND WHAT THEY DID AS PART OF THAT WAS THE PUT OUT AN RFP. UP TO THE COMMUNITY TO TO REQUEST FOR IDEAS AND IS YOU KNOW MODELS TO HELP THE CITY ACTIVATE. OF PHYSICAL SPACE SAYS TO EXPAND AND GROW THE ENTREPRENEUR ECO SYSTEM THEY THEY WERE JUST CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT KIND OF IDEAS ARE OUT THERE WHO'S WILLING TO WORK. WITH US AND HOW COULD WE MAYBE -- LOOK AT DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND OF ONE OF THE REASONS HE DID THAT'S BECAUSE AT SOME R. D. EIGHT PROPERTY THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO HOW DID -- LOOK WITHIN I MENTIONED OF THE PROJECT IN THAT CITY OF LONG BEACH WHERE -- THEY HAD ALREADY A PROPERTY. AND BECAUSE OF WE WERE IN THERE TO DELIVER SPD SERVICES THOUGHT THE CITY PROVIDES THE HARDWARE WHICH IS THE BUILDING WE PROVIDE AT THE OF THE SOFTWARE WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE SERVICES. BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REALLY OPERATE IT -- YOU KNOW EIGHT TO FIVE MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY OR MAYBE ON WEEKENDS. SO ONE OF THE IDEAS IS HOW DO WE DO THAT IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT A PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP -- AND WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A AN ENTREPRENEUR IN IN LA BLANK SPACES THEY ARE WILLING TO COME IN AND OPERATE -- LOCAL WORKING SPACE. AND WE STRUCTURED SO THAT WE ARE NOT IN THE WAY OF A FOR PROFIT ENTITY -- GENERATING YOU KNOW. RUNNING THAT -- THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE EXPERTS IT TEASES IN RUNNING A CO WORKING SPACE -- AS PARTNERS THE CITY THEM PROVIDED SOME INCENTIVES FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR AND WE ARE GOING TO BE LOCATED IN [INAUDIBLE] THIS. BEING ABLE TO OFFER DIFFERENT ATTRACT SMALL SMALL BUSINESSES TO THE CITY OF LONG BEACH THAT'S AN EXPERIMENT THAT WE ARE UNDERTAKING IN LONG BEACH. I THINK IT HAS A LOT OF PROMISE -- I'VE SEEN OTHER PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WORK -- IT'S IT'S OF THE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS RESOURCES IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW DO WE UTILIZE. AND HOW DO WE FLYING WAYS TO WORK WITH THEM IT'S VERY HARD FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO WORK WITH CITIES BECAUSE OF SO MUCH BUREAUCRACY. IT TAKES PROBABLY TEN TIMES AS LONG TO DO SOMETHING AND NOT ALL ENTREPRENEURS HAVE THE STOMACH TO DO THAT BUT SOME OF THEM OUT THERE. ARE -- AND IT'S ABOUT BUILDING COMMUNITIES ABOUT A BUILDING THE ACTUAL SYSTEM AND A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES AS WE'RE FINDING. THROUGH -- THE TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES 65% OF THEM I'VE ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE CA. TO SHERRY THE WEBSITE -- SOMEWHERE WHERE PEOPLE CAN LOOK TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT SHARED WITH US TODAY. YES -- SO. IF ANYONE'S INTERESTED IN APPLYING FOR THE GOLDMAN SACHS TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES THEY CAN GO TO WWW. SO CAO TEN K. SP DOT COM. SO THAT'S S. O. C. A. L. ONE ZERO K. SP DOT COM. AND THEN IF HE I MEAN -- IF YOU WOULD MIND I JUST LIKE TO COMMENT ON AN EARLY OF YOU HAD -- AND REMEMBER REYES UNIT OF TALKED ABOUT I THINK IT WAS FRIEDMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THE BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES COME MEETING WITH THE E. COMMERCE. THAT IS -- A THAT IS A BIG A CONCERN FOR A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES PART OF WHAT ABOUT PAT HAD MENTIONED ALSO IS. TO JOIN FOR THE E. COMMERCE BANDWAGON AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE -- OUTSIDE OF THE U.. IT'S A REALLY BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL BUSINESS TO GROW -- AND BUT A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESS I'M NOT LOOKING AT THOSE OP. SWEENEY PROGRAMS TO HELP THEM LEARN HOW TO DO BUSINESS -- GLOBALLY AND THEN THE OTHER WAY -- TO AND YOU HAVE ELUDED TO THIS AS WELL IS TO COMPETE IS BY BUILDING COMMUNITY. AND A LOT OF THAT CAN BE DONE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. IT'S ONE OF THE KEYS TO DOING THAT -- BUT ALLOWS SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T KNOW HOW TO UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA TO TO PROMOTE THEIR BUSINESS AND IT'S NOT JUST PROMOTING ITS ALSO BUILDING. PRESENCE AND BUILDING COMMUNITY. AND SO THAT'S A VERY MUCH NEEDED SERVICES WHILE [INAUDIBLE] THINKING [INAUDIBLE] YOU. YOU'RE GOING TO SHIFT GEARS AND MOVE ON NOW TO HEAR FROM SOME OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES I'M FIRST WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ACTUALLY -- OKAY PAM YOU'RE UP THERE SO WILL BRING UP PAN FROM THAT'S OKAY COME ON OUT JUST THE GUY AND THAT'S OKAY TO HAMPER FROM HIS HIGHER. AND I SHOULD KNOW MIA HERE [INAUDIBLE] AND IN A REMOTE AREA. GREAT WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A HALF ME TO SPEAK TODAY -- AND I REALLY WANT TO COMPLEMENT THE THREE SPEAKERS WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME BECAUSE AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO'S BEEN HERE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. I'VE HEARD THESE THREE PEOPLE SAY THINGS I'M GOING I COULD USE THAT TODAY I HOPE THAT THIS IS GREAT TO KNOW ABOUT IT -- UNDERTAKING MY BIGGEST PROBLEM. IS RENTS IT'S OUR COMPANIES RENT IT'S MY EMPLOYEES RAN SO RENT BESIDES BEING JUST A WONDERFUL MUSICAL WHICH WE WORKED ON IT IS ALSO ONE OF MY BIGGEST PROBLEMS -- I OWN THIS COMPANY WITH MY HUSBAND JIM MALEATE THAT'S JIM THE PIC THERE. WE STARTED NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE PERM PERMANENT BY WHAT. WE BOTH WENT TO HER CAR DESIGN WHICH IS NOW IN POWER GREEN. WE'VE LIVED IN GLENDALE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THIRTY THREE SINCE EIGHTEEN BEFORE [INAUDIBLE] AUDIT DARK THE COMPANY WE ARE BOB BURBANK AIRPORT WERE IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT -- THIRTY NINE WE'VE BEEN THEIR OVERT FIVE YEARS SO I THINK IS ANYBODY HERE WHO KNOWS AMOUNT FIVE MORE THAN POT THAT BILL -- ARE RED CURLY IS TWENTY SIX THOUSAND A MONTH AT OUR CAMP CHARGES ARE TEN THOUSAND MONTH. SO THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST TALKING ABOUT RENT IT'S ALSO TALKING ABOUT CAMERA CHARGES SINCE OUR COMMUNITY. AREA MAINTENANCE CHARGES AND I'LL GET INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN A MINUTE. SO WHAT OUR COMPANY DOLLARS ON THE HOUSE VIEWPOINT SUITING UP. OKAY. I HAVE I HAVE VISUALS ITEM WE READ PROPS TO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND WE'VE SHIPPED OUR PROPS TO EVERY CONTINENT. I PROJECTS GOING ON IN CHINA RIGHT NOW I'M CERTAINLY. IN CANADA A LOT AND I'VE DONE PRICE [INAUDIBLE] ANTARCTICA. TO SO PROP SO THE ITEMS IN A FILM OR TV SHOW THAT HELP TELL THE STORY AND SO WE HAVE A STORY COMING IN HERE -- WHAT WE'RE SEEING ARE PROPS THAT WE JUST READ IT TO TOM HANKS WHERE THESE PROPS IN A MOVIE CALLED GREYHOUND? WE CRISIS TOOK DIRECTOR SURRIDGE KNEE LA VERY MODELING THERE YOU GO I WANTED TO SHOW HOW GLENDALE AND THE FORTY THIRD DISTRICT IT'S REALLY THE CENTER OF THE ENTERTAINMENT. SO WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'VE MADE AND WE'VE USE. NOW ALL THAT'S VERY GOOD. YOU CAN WEAR IT IF YOU WANT. SO ON I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT THAT'S WHAT I DID THAT'S WHAT I GRANT. SOMEONE IT SHOULD YOU LITTLE BIT ABOUT ARE STATIC CALLED I WANTED ME TO MY STAFF MEMBERS JOHN. THE GENTLEMAN ON THE LEFT IS HERE KNOWLEDGE. ISN'T IT THAT WHEN. YOU LOOK OUT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN BROWN EYES. RENTS FROM A POLL WORKER SISTER HE WAS PROBABLY NUMBER WILLOWS BRAND OF ANYBODY WHO WORKS FOR ME. THE GENTLEMAN ON THE RIGHT JOHN HE'S SEVENTY YEARS OLD RETIRED FROM LOCALLY. AND HERE IS WHY BOTHER HOW IS BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETY TAX LOSSES BORDER. KRISTIN I SHE'S PART OF HISTORY PRIOR FOR THREE YEARS THERE'S JUST A FIVE YEARS OLD. SHE HAS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS STOOD AT AND SHE WASN'T AROUND TROLL A MINUTE SANTA WAS WITH MAY. IT'S NOT OSCAR THE CAT SIR CATHARINE THE PICTURE. NEVER THINK ABOUT IRAN. SWIM I'M BASED TO KNOW LANDLORDS ARE BOTH. BOB DOESN'T LOOK AT IRAQ BUTTON DO DAHLE. SO NEXT WEEK HE IS REMOVED LOS VEGAS. BOB WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE FILMS THAT WE WORKED ON A GREYHOUND THAT WAS THE ONE WE JUST SAW THE EXAMPLES FROM AND YOU CAN SEE THE HATS THERE THOSE ARE OUR CREW. PAINTING OF TAPS. IS PRODUCED BY APPROVED JURORS FINANCED ATWATER CAPITAL IN A DEAL BROKERED CA HEY IT IS DISTRIBUTED BY SONY. AND ITS FILMING IN LOUISIANA NOW SHIP AWARE YOU MAY. ARE WE TOLD. FROM THE MANY COMPLAINTS. NOT UP WHAT ALBERTO. TO WHO IS FINDING IT. THIS IS THE CHAIR OF THEIR WEBSITE PERSON LOS ANGELES. THIS UPS OR IS THERE ADDRESS. I'M GONNA VENTURE TO SAY THE MONTHLY RENT IT PROBABLY LESSEN MY THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. LOUISIANA OUT WHERE WE JUST DID THIS PROJECT THEY ARE FOR A UP AREA TAX REBATE. AND THE CYCLE WHAT IT FELT LOOK LIKE IF YOUR COMPANY EN LA RENTING LOUISIANA. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ON THE RIDE WOULD BE MY INVOICE ON AROUND THESE FIGURES BECAUSE I CAN'T GO FAR. ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE MY INVOICE FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THEN YOU'LL SEE WE RENTED TO A COMPANY IN LOUISIANA. WHO THEN HAS TO GO THROUGH A PASSED THROUGH COMPANY CALLED SEE CO ES? THAT PASSED THROUGH THE OPENING ADDS ON A 5% SPEED. PLUS THEY ON ON A 10% LULU TAN ATTACKS. SO DOING AMOUNT THAT REALLY WHAT THEY'RE PAYING THEY'RE GETTING IS ABOUT A 30% REBATE BACK. NOT WHO IS CCO AUS SEA COS IS MY NEIGHBOR CASTING GROUP HUGE PAYROLL COMPANY ONE OF THE BEST. AND THEY HAVE A DIVISION CALLED CAST AND CREW ON SAID THAT OFFERS. AT THAT OPERATES AS A PASS THROUGH COMPANY THEIR BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATIONS AND MANY MANY STATES. THEIR CORPORATE OFFICES IN BURBANK WHICH IS ABOUT TWO MILES FROM ME. AND THEY EMPLOY A LITTLE OVER SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE. SO THIS FILM DOING LOUISIANA THE MONEY COME THROUGH ATWATER VILLAGE. IT GOES TO BURBANK THAT THEN PAYS ME AND THEN WE SHIPPED TO LOUISIANA [INAUDIBLE] OUR THIS ONE ARE ONE OF THE ISSUES I TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS A BIG PROBLEM. OUR OUR CAMERA CHARGES COMMUNALLY REMAIN IS CHARGES WHICH ARE CLEARLY HALF OF WHAT AROUND TENANTS -- THIS IS A LETTER I GOT YESTERDAY TELLING ME THAT THE CAMP CHARGES ARE GOING UP. OF I WILL READ IT TO GET THE AUDIO VIDEO TELL ME THAT THERE ARE NOT BIRDS THEY CAN PUT IN THE SUBTEXT FOR WHAT I WOULD WANT TO SAY ABOUT MY FEELINGS ABOUT THIS LETTER. ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WE DEAL WITH ALSO MONTHS OUR CLIENTS YOUR QUESTION KNOWS CAMP CHARGES COME FROM A BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT OR FROM THE LANDLORD WHO. YOU KNOW THE LANDLORD THE LANDLORD DOESN'T YEAH -- IF THERE ARE THINGS WHERE HAVE YOU FOR THOSE WHO PEOPLE HERE WHO MAY NOT KNOW ARMY CAMP CHARGES ARE PROPERTY TAXES INSURANCE BECAUSE BUILDING MAINTENANCE ALL THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES. I WANT ANY OTHER PROBLEMS REALLY AFFECTS SMALL BUSINESSES READ IN THE AREA MEN. IS THE CAPITALIST LOCATE RESTRICTED WORD. I AM NO PROBLEMS MY BUSINESS SYNDICATE THIS. IS I'M TOTALLY O. WITHOUT LOVING IS NOT. BUT THE TWO CAT BUSINESS AND THEY COME TO HEAR BILLS WERE. THIS IS LIKE A HIGH AM LOCATED AND YOU'LL SEE FROM THERE DISTRICT HERE THOUGH BLUE AREAS. THAT. BUSINESS IS TO DO WHAT YOU ARE LOCATED. THEY CAN GO ARE OFTEN MUCH MORE MONEY PER SQUARE FOOT CAN AFFORD TO PAY. OF ONE OF THE BECAUSE I KNOW A LONGTIME GLOBAL AFFECTS. THEY HAD TO MOVE BECAUSE OF ONE DOLLAR A SQUARE FOOT BECAUSE THEY CAN GET IT FROM CANNABIS. SO IT IS AN ISSUE WE DEAL WITH LAST NIGHT I WAS TRYING TO SEE IF I COULD FIND A LARGER BUILDING IN OUR AREA. AND EVERYTHING THAT I LOOKED AT THAT WAS OVER THIRTY THOUSAND FEET SAID ZONE FOR CANNABIS ZONE FOR CANNABIS I'M NOT CAN BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THAT RANT. SO I WOULD SAY WHAT WE CAN DO NOW FOR SMALL BUSINESS -- IS TO ADD A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER TO THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION BOARD TODAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BETWEEN TO HELP ON ON THEIR THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A CAMP CHARTER FOR REFORM. AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE CAPS THING CAM CHARGES -- RENT CONTROL IN BURBANK AND GLENDALE STORE EMPLOYEES CAN AFFORD A DECENT PLACE TO LIVE WOULD BE A BIG HELP. AND THAT REALIZES PRODUCTION GOING TO OTHER STATES IS NOT ABOUT THEM BEING LURED AWAY. THOUGHT ABOUT THEM CHOOSING NOT TO FILM HERE AND YOU CAN'T FILM EVERYTHING HERE SOMETIMES. LIKE THE PROJECT WE WORKED ON A GREYHOUND IT JUST MADE SENSE FOR THEM TO FILL THAT THERE BECAUSE IT ST NAUTICAL. SO THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT TODAY RENTS ARE A BIG PROBLEM FOR ME IN MY STAFF. YOU MENTIONED LAURIE MENTIONED EARLIER SOME THINGS HE WAS SAYING IN AND MONTROSE AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. THINK [INAUDIBLE] LOOK. OKAY NEXT MOVE TO BETTY JO I'M -- TYPICALLY FROM BOARD PRESIDENT FROM THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION MORNING. WELL I LOVE OUR TOPIC -- OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. AND I THINK AS A SMALL BUSINESS PERSON SOMETIMES WE TEND TO PUT THE CHALLENGES. AND GET BOGGED DOWN IN THAT AREA VERSUS THE OPPORTUNITIES SO I WANTED TO START TODAY BY THANKING YOU. UP FIRST OF ALL I HAVE -- A HISTORY OF HAVING WORKED FOR SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY SO MAYBE I HAVE A LONG MEMORY BUT IN THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND THE ASSEMBLY PASSED A RESOLUTION THAT PROCLAIMED CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS DAY. AND EVERY YEAR THANKS TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- WE HAVE HONORED SMALL BUSINESSES IN YOUR DISTRICT. AND THE TWO OF YOU DID THAT THIS YEAR I THINK HIM ASSEMBLYMAN FRIEDMAN'S. HAVE A TYPICAL SMALL BUSINESS SITUATION THAT THE LAST MINUTE THEY COULDN'T ATTEND BUT SIMON RAYOS YOU LOOK VERY ATTRACTIVE IN THIS AND WE TRY AND LIMIT IT TO SEVENTY FIVE OUT OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BUT USUALLY RUN SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHTY AND EIGHTY FIVE ARE. THE OTHER THING I WANT. TO SHARE WITH YOU IS BY CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS FIRST. WE UP PUT THIS TOGETHER AND WE WILL FOR ME SHIP. FOR ANY LOCAL CHAMBER IN THE INDIVIDUAL SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO PROMOTE SMALL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE BACK PAGES FOR YOU TO PUT WHATEVER YOU WANT. IN THAT PARTICULAR DIRECTION. BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S NOT ENOUGH EDUCATION. ON WHO SMALL BUSINESSES. AND I WAS SITTING THERE AND I WAS THINKING OF YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE DEFINITION OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. AND SMALL BUSINESS AND I THINK PROBABLY EACH OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE OUR OWN DEFINITIONS AND I THINK THAT MAKES IT NOT ONLY HARD TO GOVERNANCE IT HIT MAKES IT HARD TO HELP US IN IN THAT DIRECTION. BUT I DO WANT TO TALK I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ADVOCACY I WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE HISTORY. IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS -- I WAS ASKED. TO OF WORK AT THE STATE LEVEL RATHER THAN THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATES. AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I EVER MADE SO I'M REALLY FOCUSED ON I CALIFORNIA. I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND I GET ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY DOESN'T HAVE. THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE TO WORK ON ALL THE ISSUES SO WHAT WE DO IS FOLLOW THE WHITE HOUSE DELEGATES -- WE HAVE. ELEVEN ISSUES COMMITTEES THAT ARE COMPOSED OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS [INAUDIBLE] THEY DETERMINE. STATEWIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON IN THAT AREA. SO LET ME TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW. BUT THEY ARE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS WORKERS COMP REFORM. AND AS YOU I THINK BOTH KNOW WE DO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS -- ON HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER AND MY NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION ON WORKERS COMP REFORM. IS WE'D LOVE TO THINGS I GUESS WE WE KNOW WORKER'S COMP OF THANKS TO THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. IS THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY GROWING TO THE CANDIDATES. AND SO WE NEED ENFORCEMENT IN IN THAT DIRECTION [INAUDIBLE] AND WE ALSO NEED -- TO LOOK AT THAT WHAT WORKS FOR BIG BUSINESS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK FOR SMALL BUSINESS IN THE AREA OF WORKERS COMP. AND I THINK THEY'RE I THINK WE'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS IN THAT. BUT I THINK WE HAVEN'T REALLY -- DONE ANYTHING THAT SHOWS SO MAYBE ONE OF THE THINGS YOU THINK ABOUT IS ENFORCEMENT OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. AND MAYBE YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YEAR GIVING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. TO GO AFTER WORKERS CONTEST DRIVE. THAT'S NOT BEING USED MAYBE THERE'S A BETTER WAY. AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON MAKING THAT HAPPEN. WE DON'T WANT THE GOOD GUYS. THAT ARE. DOING IT RIGHT. TO BE PENALIZED FROM A COMP COMPETITION STANDPOINT BY THE GUYS THAT ARE UNDERGROUND SO WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT WORKING ON THE WORKERS BECAUSE ISSUE AND PARTICULARLY THE FRAUD. THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN OF MINE IS A BILL WE HAVE -- IN. ACTUALLY IT'S STILL IN THE SENATE I AM AFRAID THAT MEANS IT'S DEAD BUT I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP -- TAXES ARE A BIG ISSUE. AND THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN ABOUT -- THE REPEAL OF THE SPLIT TAX ROLL -- WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A PROPOSAL FOR A 10% BUSINESS TAX. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOR SALES TAX ON SERVICES. AND IT GOES ON AND ON BUT I THINK MY MAJOR CONCERN. IS ON WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING -- MY SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS THE U. S. CHAMBER -- SMALL BUSINESS COUNCIL. THEY TELL ME THAT -- WHEN THE RIGS COME OUT ON TAX REFORM? THAT ONLY S. AND C. CORPORATIONS WILL BE ALLOWED TO TAKE BUSINESS EXPENSES. THIS WE'LL BE A DISASTER FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE ONLY 17%. OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE INCORPORATED. AND PART OF IT IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE EMPLOYEES IN I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE COULD. IF YOU COULD HELP US -- AND WE THINK S. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN WOULD HELP. BECAUSE THE NUMBER ONE REASON THEY DON'T INCORPORATE IS BECAUSE OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAG. SO THIS WOULD MAKE A SLIDING SCALE -- MICRO BUSINESSES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY. WOULD PAY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS MINIMUM. FOR TWO MINUTES FOUR HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED SO YOU WOULD ONLY PAY THE EIGHT HUNDRED IF YEAR GROSS REVENUES FOR FIFTEEN MILLION OR MORE -- IT'S TYPICAL THAT IS BOGGED DOWN AND APPROPRIATIONS -- I THINK YOU NEED TO EDUCATORS HOW TO GET THINGS THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CPA'S AND WE GET BOGGED DOWN WITH THE THE FINANCIAL END OF IT [INAUDIBLE] BUT HERE'S A STATISTIC THAT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT AND DO THE ARITHMETIC. IF CURRENTLY ONLY 17% OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. ARE INCORPORATED AS EITHER S. OR C. CORPORATIONS. AND THEY PAY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. IF WE COULD SWITCH THAT. 240% PAID TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. 20% PAID. FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS 20% PAID SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND 20%. PAID EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT'S A LOT OF IT EXCESS TAXES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE IT SEEMS LIKE EXPLAINING THIS AND AND PEOPLE BUYING IN BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE. THE FINANCIAL PEOPLE WITH ALL THE CHARTS AND FIGURES IN IN THAT DIRECTION SO MAYBE YOU CAN HELP US IN THAT AREA -- THE OTHER VERY I WANNA TALK ABOUT HIS PROCUREMENT -- WE'VE SUPPORTED SP. ONE OF WHICH WAS A TRANSPORTATION BILL. AND WE STILL SUPPORTIVE. OF THE COMPANION BILL WHICH WAS S. B. WON ALL. THREE PUT IN THERE TH IT TOOK OF THE MONEY WOULD GO TO LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES [INAUDIBLE] OWNERS [INAUDIBLE] UP. WE NEED DEFINITION OF LOCAL. DOES THAT MEAN -- THAT BE YOU KNOW IT'S THE COUNTY DOESN'T MEAN THE CITY DOESN'T MEAN US HOPEFULLY IT MEANS A STATE. BUT ONE OF OUR AND ACTUALLY IT'S THE CHAIR OF OUR ORGANIZATION -- HAS A STRIPING COMPANY. AND SHE BID ON BOWED. OUT OF FIVE CONTRACTS YOU CAN ONLY BEEN ON TO BECAUSE HE DIDN'T BUNDLE ON AND THE TWO WENT TO OREGON FIRMS THIS CONCERNS US. SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND REEVALUATE -- THE INCENTIVE FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO WHAT TO DO -- GOVERNOR A STATE CONTRACTING IN IN THAT DIRECTION [INAUDIBLE] UP. THE OTHER AREA THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS MINIMUM WAGE AND WE HAVE TO AMENDMENTS WE'D LIKE TO OFFER. WE AT FIRST WE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A STUDENT EXEMPTION FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE -- ENROLLED IN SCHOOL AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO SHOW THAT AND SECONDLY TOTAL COMPENSATION. THIS IS MORE THAN THE TIP CREDIT IT INCLUDES ALL SMALL FARMERS. THAT FURNISH HOUSING AS PART OF THE SALARY. IT ALSO INCLUDES PEOPLE LIKE MY BUSINESS THAT IF YOU'RE A GOOD SALES PERSON. YOU TAKE LOVE IT DIDN'T BLOW BASS HIGHER COMMISSION. THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PENALIZED BECAUSE IF YOU'RE MEDIOCRE YOU TAKE A HIGHER BASE ANALYZE A LOWER COMMISSION. SO WE NEED MAYBE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THAT AREA. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF BEING THE UMBRELLA ADVOCACY GROUP FIRST SEE EIGHT SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS. AND WE PARTNER WITH WITH MANY OTHER. OF ONE OF OUR NEWEST ISSUES AND PROJECTS. IS ON THE HOMELESS. HOMELESSNESS AND LET ME TELL YOU A STORY FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA HAIRED HAIR SALON. SAID SHE IS LOST HALF OF HER CLIENTELE. BECAUSE OF THE HOMELESS WEAKENED IN THE DOORWAY TO AND SHE IS IN A SHOPPING CENTER. AND THE SLAVE IN THE DOORWAY AND OF THE WOMEN ARE AFRAID TO COME INTO HER HAIR SALON. SO WE NEED TO WORK TO HELP THEM. BUT WE NEED TO WORK TO SOLVE THAT AND WE ARE ALL -- READY AND WILLING AND ABLE TO WORK ON THAT. SO WHAT COULD YOU DO TO HELP US. WELL I THINK SMALL BUSINESS AND I'M GOING TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURS SMALL BUSINESS. SMALL BUSINESSES TO ME HAVE EMPLOYEES [INAUDIBLE] AND WE NEED ED -- EXPRESSION THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND I THINK MOST OF IT IS UNINTENTIONAL. WHEN SOMETHING NEGATIVE HAPPENS TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY I DON'T THINK THE INTENT WAS TO HURT THE COMMUNITY? BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION OF GOVERNMENT GETS IT. GOVERNMENT WANTS TO HELP. AND GOVERNMENT IS LISTENING -- I THINK IT'S TIME TO REVISIT THE FIVE FOUR DAY TEN HOUR WEEK IF FOR NO OTHER REASON BECAUSE OF TRANSPORTATION. TRAFFIC AND THE FACT THAT EMPLOYEES OR HAVING TO DRIVE SO FAR. IT WOULD IT BE EASIER TO DRIVE FOUR DAYS THEN IT WOULD BE FIVE DAYS -- THE THING YOU ALSO WORKED ON IS RIGHT TO CURE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU CONTINUE ON THAT -- THE MOST OTHER THINGS SIX SMALL BUSINESS US WRONG WHEN THEY'RE AUDITED. IF THEY WERE GIVEN A CHANCE TO CURE IT YOU'D NEVER SEE AGAIN BUT BOY TROLL THE BOOKS ADAM IF THEY DON'T CORRECTED AND AND DO IT CORRECTLY IN THAT AREA ALL. I THINK WE NEED. TO SEND A MESSAGE. FROM SACRAMENTO TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY STATEWIDE. THAT YOU CARE. AND I KNOW YOU DO -- BECAUSE NINETY TWO OUT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEGISLATORS DO CONTACT REGULARLY WITH A SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY COUNCIL. UP WITH THEIR COMMUNITY AND THIS LIAISON IS REALLY IMPORTANT THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR CONSTITUENTS TALKING TO YOU S. AS WE'RE DOING TODAY. SO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO HELP US SEND A MESSAGE CALIFORNIA CARES ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS -- WE'RE KIND OF DEPRESSED IT CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION BECAUSE TWO OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS. HAVE DECIDED TO MOVE OUT OF STATE AND THAT'S A SIGN THAT WE DON'T LIKE AND WE'VE GOT TO CORRECT AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE IT HAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS TO THE WORK YOU DO AND I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY BECAUSE THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE [INAUDIBLE] HAS. TAKE A WHOLE LOT TO IT BEYOND WORKERS COMP ALTHOUGH THAT CERTAINLY APART -- MY HUSBAND IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IS A LANDSCAPE DESIGNER AND CONTRACTOR. AND ON IT EVERY DAY HE IS I HAS BIDS AT A REJECTED FROM HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE TAKING BITS FROM -- CONTRACTORS WHO WERE IN. POINT PEOPLE TO THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY PAYING THEIR EMPLOYEES CASH UNDER THE TABLE NOT PAYING TAXES ON THEM NOT PAYING WORKERS COMP. AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT ABSOLUTELY PENALIZES THE GOOD OPERATORS AND PUTS THOSE HOMEOWNERS IN A LOT OF FINANCIAL JEOPARDY IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO WRONG ON THEIR PROPERTY. I TO EMPLOYEE IS NOT COVERED. I'M BY THEIR EMPLOYER SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS COMMITTEE [INAUDIBLE] SUPPLY. NEXT WE HOUSEHOLD WANNA A TOLEDO FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OFFICER FOR COLLABORATIVE PLAY. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. MONNING ASSEMBLYMEMBERS SORRY MY VOICE IT'S I'VE BEEN A LITTLE BIT SICK. ISAAC BEACON HEAR ME OKAY -- WELL -- CLOUD PLAY OPEN EIGHT STORES AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER. I IT'S A COWORKING SPACE THAT OFFERS ON SITE CHILDCARE -- THEY PURPOSE OF THESE BUSINESS HAS PAIN TO HELP. I'M WE MEN -- ENTER THE WORKFORCE AFTER HAVING A BABY. I SCENES THERE'S LARGE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN -- OF RAMPING CORPORATE JOBS I ONCE THEY HAVE A CHILD. POUNDS GIVEN THE FACT THAT I NOTABLY CORPORATIONS. DO NOT OFFER -- FIXABLE -- OUR WHICH IS HIGHLY NEEDED WHEN THEY HAVE. I'M SO I OPEN THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE I WAS THAT MOM INCORPORATION -- AND I DID END UP HAVING TO COME TO A DECISION OF QUITTING -- MY JOB. TWO BECAUSE THE HOURS THAT I WAS EXPECTED -- TO PROVIDE AYE MY WORKSPACE -- THE TO BENEFIT MONTHLY LIFESTYLE THAT I WANTED TO PROVIDE. ON TO MY CHILD [INAUDIBLE] I'M. SO YOU OPEN THE DOORS TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND I AM. SAT TO SAY WE ARE SHUTTING DOWN ID AND A FEW SMALL -- EIGHTS AIR. AYE IT'S GONNA BE HARD NOT TO SHED A TEAR HERE -- WE I'M I'M HAPPY TO SAY THOUGH THAT SORT OF THE CITY YEARS WE HAVE BEEN IMPACTING THE LIVES. OF MANY MOTHERS AND ON FATHERS -- WE'VE OPENED OUR DOORS -- NOT TO SORT OF JUST WOMEN BY WE HAVE HELPED OUT A LOT OF FREE DOWNS BARONS FIGHTERS CREATIVES. BUSINESS OWNERS -- AND WE HAVE SEEN THE OREGON COLLABORATION THAT HAS FLOURISHED FROM THESE SPACE SO WE BUILT A COMMUNITY. NOT ONLY JUST THE QUIRKY SPACE -- WE HELPED CHRISTINE -- KIDS -- LEARN. TO WALK CRAWL WALK AND TALK -- IS SO AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE. ON WELL WE KNOW THAT THAT'S IN THEIR ENTIRETY NEXT IT'S SO. BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD. MICHAEL WHEN IT FIRST OPENED LAST TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE CHILDCARE HOME [INAUDIBLE] AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE. AND IN A FLEXIBLE WORK ENVIRONMENT [INAUDIBLE] M.. SO. I GUESS WHAT I AM I AM I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE TO THEY I MEAN STUFF. DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES -- BUT I'M THE MAIN THE MAIN ASPECT -- HASBEEN THEIR RENT -- I WHERE I WHERE RENT IT'S VERY VERY HIGH -- ASSIST US IN YOU'LL BE SO. YOU'RE SICK GO AIR I STARTED WITH THE BROWN YOU CONCEPT I WAS THE FIRST GORKY SPACE WHICH CHILD CARE -- TO ALBANY SOURCING IN ASSIGNED JEALOUS -- AREA. AND I SAID BROWN YOU CONCEPT THERE'S A LOT OF LEARNING. THAT YOU DO AND OBVIOUSLY ABOUT A YEAR LESS THAN A YEAR AND TO MY BUSINESS I KNEW THAT. THIS SPACE I HAVE RENTED WAS SENT -- GOING TO EVER HELP ME BECOME PROFITABLE -- BECAUSE SO THEY LAY OUT AND THE RENT -- I LEARNED THAT TOO LATE OUT ONCE I YELLED DAN ON A THREE YEAR LEASE. A EITHER VERY HIGH. RENTAL. SO. I A DEPLETED ALL MY SAVINGS THROUGH ALL THESE THREE YEARS -- I DID I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A A A JOB BECAUSE I WAS RUNNING MY BUSINESS SO -- A I'M BASICALLY SEEN THE WAY THEY HERE THAT -- WITHIN ON OUR SO -- THE THAT WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HAPPEN AND IT'S ON ONE AND TAKE -- ONE OF OUR BUT IF I MENTIONED EARLIER AFFORDABLE RENT IT'S A KEY SHOW -- BUT ALSO MAYBE FLEXIBLE TERMS FOR THOSE THAT ARE STARTING A NEW BUSINESS. ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT ARE STARTING A NEW CONCEPT -- A IT MIGHT BE SEEN AS WELL SUPPORT OF CONCEPT AND IT WAS SUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE IN THE CONCEPT ASPECT MEANING I COULD. THAT YOU COULD HAVE A IT WORK ENVIRONMENT ON A CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE SAME ROOF -- BUT FINANCIALLY SPEAKING EIGHT DIDN'T PROVE SUCCESSFUL. I SAW A WE SAY HAD HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF THE LEASE -- I'VE I'VE TRY MULTIPLE TIMES WITH THE LINE OR TO NEGOTIATE AN EXIT AND THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE. SO ON I THINK IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL -- WHETHER IS FROM -- EXISTING BROKER SKYLINE HORSE EVEN IF THERE IS A CD OWN PROPERTY THAT YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE ON SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS COULD HAVE ACCESS. TO ONE AFFORDABLE RENT INTO FLEXIBLE TERMS SO THAT WE COULD QUICKLY I'M BOUGHT OUR BUSINESS WHEN -- WHEN WE REALIZED THAT WHAT WE DID -- IT WASN'T THE BEST. THE C. SHOWN AND ANYTHING THAT'S A VERY COMMON MISTAKE MORE -- YOU KNOW I I HAVE. A CURRENTLY LOOKING AT MY BODY MY BUSINESS SO I'M I'M SHUTTING DOWN THE BRICK AND MORTAR. I IN THE VOTING NEED TO HAVE MORE OF OUR CONSULTING AND MOBILE CHILDCARE. OBSCENITIES THROUGH THE THREE YEARS WE HAVE GROWN AT THAT THEY ARE ON A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THINKING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT HUDDLE -- HOW TO VOTE BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT IT'S TRULY INCLUSIVE? AND IN ORDER TO BE TRULY INCLUSIVE YOU ARM I BELIEVE WHICH YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE A CHILD CARE. BOMB CONVERSATION AS PART OF IT -- BUT I'M HOPE THAT I COULD. OUT CONTINUE TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS HOUSE WE HAVE PROVIDED CHILDCARE. FILM FESTIVALS -- FRANCIS THE UNITED ON STATE OF WOMEN CONFERENCE RECENTLY WITH PROVIDED CHILDCARE -- OVERNIGHT WILL RECEIVE OVER THIRTY ARE BEQUESTS -- TO HELP TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN. SO THAT MOTHERS COULD GO TO THE PANELS PARTICIPATE. I'M SAYING WITH THEIR OUTFIELD FESTIVALS -- AS I HEARD THE OTHER SPEAKERS I A WAS IGNITED TO HEAR ALL THE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT THERE ARE OUT THERE. I AND I WILL FULLY TAKE ADVANTAGE -- MOWING ON I I DEFTLY NOTICE OTHER CD'S I WOULD LOVE -- THE CITY OF GLENDALE -- TO AND TO HAVE SOME WELL SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I SEE WITH THE CITY OF GLENDALE WITH THEM. ESPECIALLY WITH THE WEBSITE AYE AND TO HELP HIM THE CITY OF LONG BEACH HAS -- I KNOW ON CHANEL SHINNY. MAIENSCHEIN AN EXAMPLE EARLIER I AND I'VE SEEN HOW THEIR CITY OF LONG BEACH HAS -- APPLAUD ALL BUSINESS PORTAL THAT IT'S VERY SIMPLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH. I SAID IN YOUR BUSINESS OWNER AND I I CAN ATTEST TO THESE BECAUSE I DO HAVE A LOT OF MEMBERS OF MICHAEL WORKING SPACE THAT -- START FROM SCRATCH AND DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT IS DARK AND IT'S REALLY CONFUSING. AND TIME CONSUMING AREN'T SO AYE BUSINESS PRO LIKE FAIRS HE OF LONG BEACH WILL BE REALLY VALUABLE -- AND I KNOW THAT MAYBE A STATE LEVEL THAT'S ALREADY SOMETHING IN PLACE SCENE DOT IN -- CD LEVEL WHEN. I REALLY REALLY HELPFUL -- SOME OTHER -- OPPORTUNITIES THAT I SEE I THAT. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HAPPEN -- WOULD BE MORE -- OR STRONGER ACADEMIC SHIPS WITH THE CD I'M WITH THE COLLEGE -- OF THE CITY OF GLENDALE AM INTERNS HELP SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THEY THREE YEARS I I HAVE -- REACH OUT A LITTLE -- TO THE CITY COLLEGE BUT I THINK. AND YOU KNOW THERE WERE MAYBE SOME INCENTIVES FOR SCHOOL CREDITS OR THINGS LIKE DOT IT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL -- OTHER WAYS ALSO BEYOND MAYBE TRYING TO FIND OUT SOME CDS TO PROVIDE. AND EVEN THE SMALL LEVEL GRANTS OUT JUST TO HELP THOSE IN JAPAN HOURS START THEIR BUSINESSES SO THEY CAN. PERFORM THEIR GOAL COMPANIES -- IT WILL BE NO FROM A CORPORATE INFORMATION. ANYBODY WILL NEED A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET STARTED AND ADULT SWEETHEART WHEN -- WHEN YOU KNOW HOW THE FUNDS AND AND I HAVE TAX INCENTIVES -- I'VE I LOOKED UP ONE OF THE YORK -- THEY HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED START UP YORK -- AND IT SAYS STOP I'M THE STATE OF NEW YORK HELPS NEW AND EXPANDABILITY SAYS. THROUGH TAX BASE INCENTIVES AND INNOVATIVE ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS STATE OF NEW YORK OFFERS NEW AND EXPANDED BE SAYS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPERATE TAX FREE FOR TEN YEARS. ON OR NEAR ELIGIBLE UNIVERSITIES ARE COLLEGE CAMPUSES IN YOUR STATE. PARTNERING WITH THE SCHOOLS GIVES BUSINESSES DIRECT ACCESS TO ADVANCED RESEARCH LABORATORIES DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES AND EXPERTS IN KEY INDUSTRIES -- SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT -- KNOW THIS YOU HAVE GLENDALE IS ALSO LOOKING. TO REALLY ENERGIZE THE TECHNOLOGY ECO SYSTEM HAVING SOME SORT OF TAX INCENTIVE FOR THOSE ENTREPRENEURS -- DIED ARE INTO TEXT BASED GAME SOMETHING LIKE ALONG THOSE LINES WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL. THANK YOU SALON I'M VERY SAD BECAUSE SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS CLOSING I REMEMBER VISITING YOU WHEN YOU FIRST OPEN AND THINK [INAUDIBLE] AN AMAZING. FOR THINKING CONCEPT I IN FACT THERE'S A BILL RIGHT NOW IN THE ASSEMBLY. BELIEVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANDY VOEPEL. TO REQUIRE -- STATE OFFICES TO ALLOW -- NEW PARENTS TO BRING THEIR CHILDREN TO WORK WITHOUT. SO I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF YOUR TIME -- THAT I AM SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT THE CLOSING AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMING TO SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH EVERYBODY THINK YOU. THINK YOU. AND ALSO THAT SOMETIMES WHEN WE BEGIN SOMETHING WE GIVE IT OUR ALL. BUT WE DON'T QUITE MAKE IT AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN SAID SOMETIMES WERE AHEAD OF OUR TIME BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT YOUR EXPERIENCE MAKES YOU. THAT MUCH MORE OF AN EXPERT TO HELP SOMEBODY ELSE YOU YOU THEN BECOME AN ADVOCATE. WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE NEEDS HELP IN THE THINKING OF THE BUSINESS YOU CAN TELL ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE? AND WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE CHANGED WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY TO HELP THEM SUCCEED IN THEIR BUSINESS AND CLEARLY YOU'RE YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT IT THAT IT APPEARS THAT. IS WILLING TO HELP OTHERS IN MAY HELP. SEE BUT I I I WISH YOU GREAT SUCCESS IN YOUR NEXT ENDEAVOR THINK DON'T GIVE UP ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. WHATEVER THE TITLE IS RIGHT. TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO COLLEGE THANK YOU THANK YOU -- OUR LAST -- SPEAKER BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT IT'S TODD SCHWARTZ WHO'S THE OWNER OF DICKEY'S BARBECUE PIT WHICH IS A FAMOUS LOCAL RESTAURANT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT DID. IT IS PART OF A FRANCHISE SYSTEM ALL I'M SORRY THERE ARE IT IS THE LARGEST BARBECUE. BOB WITH THE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED LOCATIONS RIGHT NOW AND I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE UNIQUE YOU WITH HOURS. DO WHAT WE CAN -- BOTH MAKE IT FEEL LOCAL AND AND ONE OF THE KEY POINTS I WANTED TO TO BRING UP THIS OFTENTIMES FRANCHISE OWNERS NOT CONSIDERED LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS MEMBERS -- AND IN FACT GET EXCLUDED FROM PROGRAMS LIKE SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY. WELL. IT'S MY MONEY IT YOU KNOW IT'S MY FAMILY'S MONEY THAT'S IN THAT -- RESTAURANT -- IT'S THE SAME STAFF BUT GETS PAID IT OUT OF YOU KNOW THE THE SALES THAT WE HAVE -- AND EVERYTHING WE THAT GOES INTO THE RESTAURANT COMES OUT OF THE RESTAURANT. IS PRODUCED BY THE BUSINESS OWNER -- AND YOU KNOW WE JUST GOT SOME MARKETING SUPPORT AND AND PAY ADDITIONAL MONEY. TO THE FRANCHISE SYSTEM -- SO WE ARE VERY MUCH SMALL BUSINESSES NEARLY -- AND AS SUCH UM WE JUST CELEBRATED OUR SIXTH YEAR MONSANTO'S -- ON JULY -- TWENTY SIX WE OPEN IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FOR A RESTAURANT TO SURVIVE AS WE KNOW IS THAT IT DIFFICULT. TO IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE OPENED WE HAD NO. CLUE THAT -- WHICH IS REALLY GOING UP AT AN INCREDIBLE RATE -- HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN RAISING FEES ON EVERYTHING WE'VE WE OFFER A FREE SOFT SERVE THE CUSTOMERS I WAS ONE OF OUR STAPLES -- WHICH MAKES ME A SOFT SERVE -- MANUFACTURERS LIKE A SAUCER MANUFACTURER BERMAN -- WHICH HAS GONE UP FROM HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE TO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. TO THE COUNTY OUT WHILE THE SERVICE WHICH USED TO BE RUN SEPARATELY FROM MORE TO HEALTH FOOD UP ASSEMBLY SPECTER NOW AFFORDABLE SOMETHING THE SAME INSPECTOR AND DOES THAT HOUSE. SO THEY'RE USING HER PEOPLE THE CHARGING A LOT MORE OUT OF THE COUNTY ALSO JUST RAISED I THINK A 15% INCREASE ON OUR ARE RESURRECTED WE KNOW IT. ON OUR BOARD OF HEALTH FOR ME. SO I JUST PAID TWELVE HUNDRED AND I'LL GET A BILL FOR ANOTHER. NOT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- THOSE ARE PERMITS PLEASE PERMITS SO IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW. WHERE THE COST THOSE ARE ALL LOCAL BECAUSE -- THE SO. YOU I'M WITH ONE MY MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT BEING A BUSINESS OWNER IS. I GET AND WERE LOCATED NEAR CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE. SO WE HIRED A LOT OF STUDENTS WE HIRED YOU KNOW WHILE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL WE OFFER FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING. SO THAT WHEN THEY HAVE CLASSES WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO KNOW TO WORK AROUND THEIR SCHEDULE AND HAVING STOP THAT WE CAN FILL IN THE HOLES -- I KNOW THERE'S A BILL OUT THERE COMES AND GOES SEEMS FOR PAST YEARS FOR PREDICTIVE SCHEDULING -- PREDICTIVE SCHEDULING WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO US -- I OFFER A THREE WEEK SCHEDULE CURRENTLY. BUT NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN THE STAFF CHANGES THE SCHEDULE -- YOU KNOW THEY NEED PEOPLE TO COVER THEIR SHIPS BECAUSE THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS THAT COME UP. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING THREE WEEKS FROM TODAY TWO O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT. I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO BE THERE SO THAT HAS RULING IMPACT. AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN SOME OF THESE PREDICTIVE SCHEDULING BILLS. TO ALLOW SOMEBODY SAID TO GET THE HIRE SOMEBODY AND THEN THERE'S NO PENALTIES. HIRE SOMEBODY FROM BRING SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER SHIFT EVERYTHING NOW HOW SOMEBODY ELSE THAT I HAVE TO FILL THAT SHIFT VOCAL BACK PERSON FROM. SO KIND OF ROLLS DOWNHILL -- SO JUST KEEP IN MIND THE PURSUIT OF SCHEDULING FOR RESTAURANT. IS IS PRETTY DEADLY -- IN ADDITION BIGGER RESTAURANT WE OFFER CATERING SERVICES AND PEOPLE DON'T PLAN AHEAD I GOT A CALL LAST NIGHT. FOR FIFTY PEOPLE WANT THE CATERING ON SATURDAY. I HAVE STAFF THAT IS GLAD TO DO IT THEY WANT THE EXTRA HOURS SO THEY CAN COME IN. BUT UNDER THESE PREDICTIVE SCHEDULING BILLS I HAVE TO PAY A PENALTY. FOR GIVING MY STAFF ADDITIONAL HOURS. SO THEN I HAVE TO WAYS OF WORTH TAKING IS A CATERING OR NOT TAKE CARE -- MOST THE TIME A CATERING SCUM AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. SO YOU DON'T HAVE AN OFFICE LUNCH THAT WAS IMPLANTED OR YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS AMAZED WHEN. SOMEBODY TELLS IT'S EITHER GOT FORTY PEOPLE FOR DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT MIGHT REALLY ALL OF THE SUDDEN. YOU OFFER DIFFERENT -- BUT WE CAN DO IT BOTH WILL DO IT -- SO PREDICT THE SCHEDULING NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST. ARE THERE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT SHOW UP FREQUENTLY -- SICK PAY. THE BILL IS NOW SIX DAYS OUR SHIPS BY THE WAY ARE. GENERALLY SIX HOURS BY THE HAVE TO SIX HOURS -- AND SICK PAY WORKS ON A TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY. SO INSTEAD OF GETTING. IF IT'S A THREE DAY INSTEAD OF GETTING THREE DAYS OF SICK HEADS ACTUALLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS WOULD BE FIVE DAYS OF SICK PAY. THEY FIVE SERVICE WHEN IT GOES TO SIX THAT'S TEN DAYS. OF SICK PAY HEARING CITY ABOUT WHY -- BECAUSE THE CASE IS A NO QUESTIONS ASKED POLICY THERE'S NO DOCTORS NO THERE NOTHING REQUIRED TO SAY YOU WERE SAYING -- BECAUSE WE HAVE STUDENTS. SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE SUMMER FRIDAY NIGHTS IN THE SUMMER STUDENTS MAKE OTHER PLANS. SO THEY CALL IN SICK. AND THEY DON'T GIVE YOU NOTICE. YOU KNOW WE ASK. BUT THEY FEAR THAT IF WE GIVE US NOTICE THEM IS NOT CONSIDERED A SICK DAY. SO LOW COST THAT AFTERNOON EXACT INCOME AND OR THOUGH BECAUSE OF THE START OF THEIR SHIFT AND SAY HEY I NEED TO SIT BACK -- GOING TO CONCERTS. YOU KNOW AND SO WE HAVE THIS TIME BECAUSE THEY GET PAID ANYWAY. THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO SHOW UP ON THOSE WEEKENDS DURING THE SUMMER [INAUDIBLE] REALLY. A REAL ISSUE -- AND IT'S NOT JUST ONE BUT I FEEL I KNOW MANY RESTAURANTS ARE FEELING. AROUND THIS FACILITY -- SAID SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND I I WAS AT THE HEARINGS PERCENT PAY I KNOW THE ISSUES THAT COME UP WITH FAMILIES OF SUPPORT. YOU KNOW TRYING TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE BUT WHEN WE DO A BLANKET [INAUDIBLE] LAW. THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SITUATION. AT ALL IT'S NO QUESTIONS ASKED ITS WHATEVER YOU CAN GET AROUND TO CALLING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL IT THE DAY AFTER THE START OF HER SHIFT. ANY OF THOSE FACTORS. TOTALLY. I'M FINE UNDER THE OCCURRENCE OF PEBBLES -- IN ADDITION [INAUDIBLE] THE THE WAGE INCREASES -- ARE BIG UNKNOWN FOR US. THERE WERE RESTAURANTS. THE STAFF GETS TAPPED OUT OF A CERTAIN UPS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A FULL SERVICE WHICH GOING FROM WE JUST WANT TO TWELVE DOLLARS RAISE PRICES. WE GOT A FIFTEEN DOLLARS UNITS ANOTHER BIG INCREASED FROM THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND FIFTEEN AND THEN IT'S GONNA BE TIED TO INFLATION. WHICH MEANS WE'RE GONNA HAVE WAGE INCREASES EVERY YEAR. BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE RAISE WAGES BUSINESSES HAVE TO RAISE PRICES. SO WE'VE CREATED A SPIRAL. THAT. IS GONNA MAKE IT VERY HARD FOR US TO STABILIZE WAGES IN PREDICTING THE FUTURE. WHAT OUR WAGES ARE SO WHAT A RESTAURANTS DOING WHAT WE CALL CUTS DOWN? I HAD SIXTEEN PEOPLE WHEN I OPENED. WHICH IS WHEN EVERYONE TO FOURTEEN AND I DON'T. TWELVE AND FOR AWHILE WE WERE ATTACKED -- ONCE. EVERYBODY GOES BACK TO SCHOOL WILL BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE PEOPLE -- FROM WHAT I'M SEEING IN OTHER CITIES THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS RAIMES. WE'VE GOT TO STOP. SO IT'S NOT THAT YOU KNOW OR WE CUT THE HOURS. THAT THE STAFF IS WORKING FINE FROM SEVEN HOUR SHIFTS TO SIX HOURS OF SURVIVORSHIP -- SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT KEEP IN MIND REFUSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE TO MEET THAT BOTTOM LINE IS NOT THAT WE WANT TO GET FROM LOS. STOCK TO MEET THE BOTTOM. ONE IT IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO PAY FOR YOUR MEAL. YOU KNOW THERE'S A POINT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE PRICING. CUSTOMERS OUT OF THE RESTAURANT -- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COVER SO MUCH IN WAGES. AS I JUST WAGES ITS WORKERS COMP AND IT'S WITH TAXES ON WHICH BRINGS ME MY NEXT POINT -- AND BETTY WAS KIND ENOUGH TO BRING IT UP. WE DON'T HAVE A TOTAL COMPENSATION PLAN HERE IN THE STATE. I KNOW THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN ADVOCATING -- FOR ONE BUT ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS I THINK IS. WHEN A CUSTOMER LEAVES THE TEST? FOR SOMEBODY WHO WORKS AT THE RESTAURANT. I HAVE TO PAY TAX. ON A PORTION OF THAT. TO THE EMPLOYER PAYS TAX ON IT UP AS WELL WHICH IS TOTALLY FINE WITH THEIR INCOME [INAUDIBLE] BUT I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ISSUE THAT. THE TIP IS COUNTED AS WAGES WHEN I HAVE TO PAY TAXES OF THE STATE. AND WORKERS COMP BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT BASIS WELL. BUT IS NOT COUNTED AS WAGES TOWARDS MINIMUM WAGE. SO SOMETIMES IT'S CONSIDERED A WAGE SOMETIMES IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A WAGE AND IT SEEMS TO BE WHENEVER IT'S CONVENIENT. TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF THE BUSINESS HAS TO PAY. SO MY FIRST TASK. IS PERHAPS WE CAN WAIVE THE EMPLOYER PORTION. OF THE TAX ON TIPS. IT DOES SEEM FAIR ABOUT. LIKE ABOUT 1212%. ON EVERY DOLLAR. THAT EMPLOYEE MAKES ATTEMPTS. WHICH I CAN STEP -- THE LAST THING. AND AGAIN I I CAN'T SUPPORT READY ENOUGH THAT HER RIGHT TO TERRACE STATEMENTS. YOU KNOW. THE THE CALIFORNIA'S THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED. AND GIVING THEM A BUSINESS OWNER THE RIGHT TO CARE ONE ERROR SERVERS ARE. FAMOUSLY -- IS. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I THINK 90% OF THE TIME DEFINED BUSINESS DO IT IF THEY DON'T DO IT. BENNY COME DOWN HARD ON A THE NEW. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION WEBSITE. IS VERY CONFUSING. MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE OLD BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WEBSITE. AND I'D HOPE THAT SOMEBODY TAKES A LOOK AT IT AND SIMPLIFIES A FOR BUSINESS OWNERS. IS TRYING TO FIND WHERE TO PAY THE TAXES [INAUDIBLE] IT'S DIFFICULT -- AND IT APPEARS THAT THEY'RE TAKING LONGER TO PROCESS THE PAYMENT [INAUDIBLE] AS WELL -- SO. I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE -- AND THAT'S YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY BE UP THE OTHER PART THAT WE'RE FACING WHICH I WILL BRING UP. IS I HAS A RESTAURANT WE ARE NOW USING LOTS OF THIRD PARTY DELIVERY SO. GRUBHUB DOOR DAKSH POSE MEANS. TWENTY FOUR NINA GLOBAL TRYING USE THEM ALL -- THEY'LL TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF OUR SALES. COMMISSION WHICH WE HAPPILY PAY BECAUSE THEY COVER THE COST OF THE DELIVERY. CURRENTLY THEY COLLECT THE SALES TAX. ON THE SALE. OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT SOLD. BUT THEY DON'T PAY SALES TAX THEY PASSED BUT SALES TAX BACK TO THE RESTAURANT. AND THEN WE HAVE TO PAY SALES TAX ON WHAT THEY SENT TO US OFF ON WHAT OUR SAILORS WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT WHAT THEY SEEM TO US. BECAUSE I'VE TAKEN A COMMISSION OFF OF THAT. IT'S BECOMING MORE MORE COMPLICATED TO TRAFFIC AS WE ALL USE REVENUE. FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS AS TO WHAT PORTION THAT THEY'RE SENDING US A SALES WHICH PART IS SALES TAX -- AND THERE WHICH ARE WE ABOUT TO STATE. AND I THINK WE LOOK AT IT AND HAD THE THIRD PARTY SERVICES. PAVE SALES TAX THAT THEY COLLECT ON THE STATE WOULD PROBABLY DO BETTER. BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE CHANCE OF GETTING THAT SALES TAX. TO THE CORRECT AMOUNT -- AND WOULD BE SOMETHING A LITTLE EASIER FOR THE RESTAURANTS HAVE TO ATTRACT. THANK YOU BADLY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU IT WAS -- IT WAS VERY VERY HELPFUL AND CERTAINLY A LOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE PARTICULAR TO RESTAURANTS BUT THEY'RE HUGE. SECTION OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY SO IT'S NO REALLY GOOD TO HE SECURITY AND ALSO THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE COMMON TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT BUSINESSES LIKE THE FLEXIBILITY IN SCHEDULING. A SIX STATE SICK DAY ISSUE WHICH WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF BUSINESSES UNANSWERED -- EXPERIENCE WELL WITH HIS EMPLOYEES I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU AND I AM ASKING THIS HONESTLY NOT WITH ANY PREJUDICE -- WHY STILL GIVEN THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE TOTAL? NEIL EXPERIENCES COSTING THEM. AND GIVEN THAT YOU'RE NOW PAYING A LIVING WAGE WHERE YOU ALLOWING TIPPING. WHY IS THAT STILL PART OF YOUR BUSINESSES AND NON FULL SERVICE RESTAURANT GIVEN THAT YOU'RE PAYING TAX UNDER YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE NO LONGER GETTING SUB MINIMUM WAGES AS WAITERS THEY'RE NOW GETTING? A LIVING WAGE I AND THEN YOU COULD THAT YOU CAN CONTROL AND SUPPLEMENT IF YOU NEED TO I THINK A LIVING WAGES AND NUMBER. TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR OR IN THE FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. KNOWING OF RENTS ARE. LIKE PEOPLE LIVING IN A SO WHAT I FOUND INITIALLY WE DID NOT ALLOW TIPPING AT ALL -- BY. THE CITY OF LA SET UP TO WAGES. AND RIGHT NOW BEING UNDER TWENTY SIX EMPLOYEES MY MINIMUM WAGES. TWELVE IF I HAD MORE THAN TWENTY SIX EMPLOYER. THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE BUT AS AN EMPLOYER I HAVE TO COMPETE FOR EMPLOYEES. FROM BIGGER RESTAURANTS PREDICT BUFFALO WILD WINGS ARE TGI FRIDAY'S. WHICH ALL HAVE OVER TWENTY SIX TOYS SO THEY'RE PAYING THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE AN HOUR AS A BASE -- ALLOWING THE TIPPING GETS MY EMPLOYEES UP. TO FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS EVERY PAYCHECK -- AND IT ALLOWS ME TO RETAIN THOSE EMPLOYEES -- IN THE PROCESS WHICH IS A VALUABLE -- BANG AND IT HELPS THEM IT MAKES MORE MONEY FOR THE EMPLOYEES SO. YOU KNOW I LOOK AT IT HAS -- A WIN FOR THE EMPLOYEES THAT TO A LARGE PART AND REDUCES TURNOVER [INAUDIBLE] FOR ME. AND THERE SERVICES BETTER KNOWING THAT THEY'RE TALKING TO THE CUSTOMERS. AND ENGAGING CUSTOMERS AS THEY GO THROUGH OUR LINE -- SO THE CUSTOMER REALLY FEELS LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THE PROCESS. SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT A HOLDING COMPANY WERE VERY WARM. TO THE RESTAURANT AND OTHER ENGAGE WITH YOU ABOUT HOW YOUR DAY IS. WHAT KIND OF FOOD YOU WANT AN OBVIOUS? SO IT GIVES US A LITTLE HIGHER LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN BECOME HE STATED [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. THREAT THAT SPOKE BEFORE YOU WALK AWAY [INAUDIBLE] YOU PROVIDED. WHY LIST IT DOES HAVE SOME OF THE OTHER SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS I REALLY THANK YOU FOR THAT -- I THINK A COMMENT OF SOMEONE NUMBER FRIEDMAN MADE EARLIER IS THAT. THE LARGE CORPORATIONS HAVE THEIR PAID LOBBYISTS THE COMING IN AND WE HEAR FROM THEM WHENEVER THERE'S ANY LEGISLATION THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEM. WE DO FOR IT AYE AYE ENGAGE MY CHAMBERS I HAVE CHAMBERS IN EVERY CITY SOME OF THE MORE ARE MORE ENGAGING THAN OTHERS. I ALSO HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT MEETS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. IF LIKE IF WE DON'T HEAR SMALL BUSINESSES. THEN WE'RE NOT TOTALLY INFORMED WHEN IT'S TIME FOR US TO VOTE ON SOMETHING -- WEEK WE HEAR FROM THE EMPLOYEES. ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED AND WHAT THEY WANT. HAVING THE INPUT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU -- ONE EXAMPLE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT WAS THE PREDICTIVE SCHEDULING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY ONE OF THE SPEAKERS BEFORE YOU. WE KNOW WHY IT IS IMPORTANT. AND WHY WE NEED TO HAVE IT. WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW FROM THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY IT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THE EXCEPTIONS TO COMMUNICATE TO ANY OF THE RULES OR ANY OF THE THAT THE LAWS THAT WE THAT WE THAT WE ENACT. THAT WE'D THE BILLS THAT WE INTRODUCE. SO PLEASE SPEAK WITH US. WHETHER IT'S WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN OR MY OFFICE WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU AND SOMETIMES WE CAN FIND WAYS. TWO OUT OF THE EXCEPTION ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WAS THE RIGHT TO CURE. I I HAD A NUMBER OF THOSE COME TO MY COMMITTEE SOME OF THOSE WE KNEW WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO VOTE. FOR LIKE EIGHTY COMPLIANCE THAT'S ALREADY THE LAW AND WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ADA COMPLIANCE. THERE WERE A FEW OTHERS WERE PROVIDED. THE OPPOSE THE WAS TO PROVIDE A THIRTY DAY WINDOW. CURED. WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE EXAMPLES AND IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER WHEN WE'RE SPEAKING AND COMMITTEE WHEN WE SAY. WE HEARD FROM THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT OUR COMMUNITY THIS IS HOW THEY ARE AFFECTED. AS OPPOSED TO JUST HEARING TESTIMONY FROM ONE SMALL BUSINESS [INAUDIBLE] THERE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BASE IT ON SO DO DO REACH OUT TO US. DO TELL US YOUR OPINIONS DOESN'T ALWAYS GO ONE PERSON THERE ONE GROUPS WHERE ANOTHER GROUP'S WEIGHT BUT WE DO NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU. THAT'S WHY MY SMALL BUSINESS BY SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THEY'RE CALLING AND SPEAKING WITH DANIEL -- FROM MY OFFICE WHO IS OUR EXPERT ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU AND WE WELCOME YOUR YOUR COMMENTS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I APPRECIATE THAT I AND WHAT. AT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES. TIME AWAY FROM THEIR BUSINESS EITHER GO TO SACRAMENTO OR OR COME TO YOUR OFFICES -- ALCOHOL BACK AND THEN THEY DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT WAYS IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW I I DO GO UP SACRAMENTO WHAT THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION -- AND WE APPRECIATE IT AND I KNOW THE PROJECT IS GOING STARTED TO SOMETHING IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND IT'S CONTINUED TO DWINDLE THAT THE NUMBER KEEP SHRINKING. SO KEEP IN MIND RESTAURANTS ON A VERY DIFFERENT BUSINESS -- AND IF THERE'S GOING TO CARVE OUT THAT THINK THAT WOULD BE WELL WORTH PARTY AT THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE SPEAKERS ON THE AGENDA BUT WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. THERE'S ANYBODY HERE -- WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS US I WILL GIVE YOU ABOUT THREE MINUTES EACH? COME ON UP TO THE TO THE DYESS -- ONE BY. ONE WELCOME THANK YOU FOR COMING. I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE TIMERS THIS IS GOING TO BE IT'S IT'LL BE VERY SURE IT'S OUT ALISON I LOST FOR THIS LEDGER AND I'M ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS FELIS. BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH HERE TODAY AND I AM SO GLAD I CAME WHEN I STARTED MY BUSINESS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING. AND THEY MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES TOO SO I'M I'M VERY HAPPY THAT I STILL EXIST -- I JUST WANTED TO SAY IN LOS FELIS IT'S ALL ABOUT -- THERE'S NO PLACE TO PARK -- WE RECENTLY BOUGHT A STORY IN THE LEDGER WHERE AND A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES CLOSE AND THE CITED. THERE'S A PLACE TO PARK AND IT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE BUSINESSES AND FOR THE RESIDENTS BECAUSE YOU WOULD A PARKING ON THEIR STREETS. WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM -- ALSO THE RENTS I THINK THAT BETWEEN MY RUN FOR MY COMMERCIAL OFFICE WELL AS MY RESIDENTS. IS ABOUT SIXTY OR 70% OF MY INCOME. AND IT'S IT'S STAGGERING AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THAT EITHER. REGARDING THE BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS WHERE OF LOS FELIS IS A VERY SMALL BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT. AND IT IS -- MERCHANT BASS BROTHERS AND PROPERTY BASE WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BUT THE VERY SMALL BUDGET WE HAVE IN AND MODE AND THE BUSINESSES HATE THAT THIS. S. BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER TAX. BUT MOST OF THE I THINK SEVENTY OR 75% OF OURS VERY SMALL BUDGET. GOES TO WHAT MOST PEOPLE PERCEIVE ARCH CITY SERVICES LIKE PICKING UP THE TRASH TRIMMING THE TREES OR WASHING THE SIDEWALKS. SO I MEAN WE CAN'T USE OUR FUNDS -- TO DO THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD DO TO HELP PROMOTE THE SMALL BUSINESSES WITH MARKETING AND AND OTHER PROGRAMS ALL OF IT GOES TO THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK. THE CITY DOESN'T HEAR HIM WOULD MEAN THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE THAT IS LIKE NO THE CITY OF LA DOES NOT. DO THAT IT IN LOS FELIS IF YOU WANNA -- IN LOS OUT LOS ANGELES BE ONE TO GET YOU TREES TRIMMED IN THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. IT'S FIFTEEN YEARS YOU HAVE TO WAIT -- SO WILL WILL SPEND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON TRIMMING TREES YOU KNOW LOS FELIS VILLAGE. I RIGHT THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY I'M JUST SO HAPPY I CAME -- I'M GONNA REPEAT BE REPORTING BACK TO THE BED ON SOME OF THE THINGS I LEARNED HERE AND ID LIKE TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH OTHERS -- DOT A MEASURE TODAY REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME. YOU FOR COMING THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR YOUR COMMUNITY WORK THAT ALLEGES A REALLY IMPORTANT THAT PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITIES [INAUDIBLE] YOU [INAUDIBLE] ANYBODY ELSE [INAUDIBLE] NOBODY -- WELL THEN I'LL MOVE TO CLOSING COMMENTS -- ISRAEL'S YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING. I JUST WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO CAME FROM THE STATE TO PROVIDE A SEPARATION. I APPRECIATE THE GOLDMAN SACHS. PROGRAM AS WELL AND I KNOW SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES ALL ENCOURAGE THEM TO LOOK INTO THAT. MOST ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE SMALL BUSINESSES FOR BEING HERE. IT'S SO SO IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM YOU -- WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR A SHORT WHILE YOU'RE CLOSING YOUR DOORS OR YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME TO PROVIDING INTERNATIONAL SERVICES. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM YOU [INAUDIBLE] I I IF WE DON'T HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN WE ARE MAKING OUR DECISIONS IN A VACUUM. YES WE HAVE SMALL BUSINESS EXPERIENCE -- FAMILY EXPERIENCES BECAUSE WE OWN AURA FAMILIES OWN SMALL BUSINESSES. BUT AS THESE. BILLS ARE BEING INTRODUCED WE DO WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. AND EACH OF OUR OFFICES NOT ONLY IN OUR OFFICES BUT OTHER -- OTHER OF OUR OUR COLLEAGUES OFFICES THEY DO HAVE PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE WERE GOING TO LISTEN TO THE STERN. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR THE SENATOR KNOWS OF THE CONCERNS OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES. WE DO NEED TO HEAR YOU WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE CONSTITUENTS -- HOUSE ARE THE HOMEOWNERS AS OUR THAT THE SOFTBALL PLAYERS IN THIS THOSE IN SPORTS. YOUR ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU SO THAT WHEN WE MAKE DECISIONS AND WE WE TAKE OUR VOTES THEY ARE INFORMED VOTES. AND DURING THE PROCESS OF THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS WERE ABLE TO OFFER. AMENDMENTS WERE ALL ABLE TO OFFER COMMENTS SO THAT THE OFF AUTHOR OF THE BILL CAN ALSO CONSIDER THOSE CONCERNS ARE BROUGHT TO US BY OUR CONSTITUENTS SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR PROVIDING YOUR INPUT. I WANT -- TO ALSO THANK EVERYONE WHO CAME AND ALSO I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES FOR DRIVING IN ALL THE WAY FROM SAN BERNADINO COUNT TO BE WITH US HERE TODAY -- BICU WHEN IT CAME FROM LONG BEACH TO FROM ALL OVER THE AREA. I WILL SAY THAT -- THE SMALL BUSINESSES DO HAVE VOICES WITH THE LOCAL CHAMBERS WITHIN THIS AREA WITH BIZ FED AND VIKA. AND THESE ARE GROUPS THAT ARE IN OUR OFFICE AND INTERACTING WITH US ON THE OTHER ASSEMBLY IN. QUITE OFTEN SO IF YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE REACHING OUT DIRECTLY TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I HOPE YOU DO FEEL COMFORTABLE BUT THOSE THOSE GROUPS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN THE MEAT. ALL THE TIME AND THEY OFFER GREAT NETWORKING I'M OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IN THEY ALSO DO ADVOCATE ON ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO REGIONAL -- BUSINESS GROUPS BECAUSE MONTHS IT VARIES IF YOU'RE IN LOS ANGELES THAT'S A WHOLE SET OF ISSUES THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM GLENDALE THAT. ACTUALLY TRIMS THE TREES AND AND AND DOES YOU KNOW PROVIDES DIFFERENT SERVICES SO SOMETIMES DIFFERENT BUSINESSES. HOW DIFFERENT OBSTACLES IN DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON WHERE THEY ARE A BUT THIS IS REALLY HELPFUL AND FOR ME IT'S THE BEGINNING OF -- WELCOME THE CONTINUATION OF A DIALOGUE THAT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY SINCE COMING INTO OFFICE BUT THERE WERE SOME REALLY SOLID. OPPORTUNITIES HERE AND AND I'M INFORMATION HERE THAT I HOPE THAT. OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY WATCHES BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD FROM MY BUSINESS WHO DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT A LOT OF WHAT'S ON AVAILABLE THROUGH THE STATE AND THROUGH THE COUNTY SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL PUSH THAT OUT THEM GLAD THE PRESS IS HERE. MEN CAN HELP MAYBE PUT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION OUT TO THE COMMUNITY -- BUT ALSO THE CHALLENGES THAT COME UP THAT ARE GROWING CHALLENGES AND SOME OF THEM ARE HUGE THINGS LIKE WORKERS COMP I'D LOVE TO GO IN REFORM WORKERS COMPLEMENT EXTERIOR. I'LL BE REALISTIC. WE MIGHT HAVE THAT AS A LONG TERM GOAL IT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR. BUT OTHER THINGS ARE DEFINITELY -- OF MORE IMMEDIATE IN TERMS PENDING WHAT. SO IT'S REALLY GREAT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT AND THEN SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS LIKE MAKING SURE THIS A SMALL BUSINESS ON THE FILM COMMISSION IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN GO IN AND TRY TO HAVE AN IMPACT ABOUT IS THOSE POSITIONS OPEN UP -- HEARING ABOUT. I'M THE PROCUREMENT ISSUES AND ABOUT CONTRACTS THAT -- SP ONE SAYS SHOULD BE LOCAL CONTRACTS AND MAYBE LOOKING INTO THAT AND HAVING SOME OVERSIGHT AND SAYING IS THAT REALLY BEING DONE. HOW IS THAT DONE -- THESE ARE ALL REALLY -- THE SOLITAIRE CRIMES FROM TODAY. LIKE I SAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE OF THESE -- SMALL BUSINESS MEETINGS ON THE CENTRAL COAST AND I WAS JUST TOLD THAT WE HAVE A REQUEST FROM ONE SAMPLE TO DENOUNCE. WILL TRY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND YOU KNOW TALK TO SOME OF THE FOLKS OUT THERE ABOUT SOME OF THEIR ISSUES. SO AGAIN I THINK EVERYBODY FOR PARTICIPATING THIS IS JUST BEGINNING OF OF YOU KNOW THIS DIALOGUE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE PARTICIPATION WE HAD TODAY. THANKS SO MUCH
