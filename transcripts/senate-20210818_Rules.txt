GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON BY STRIP BATES AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY HONORED TO BE HERE REAPPOINTED NOW FOR A SECOND TERM BY THE GOVERNOR. AND JUST REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU I'M HERE JOINT VIRTUALLY BY MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER AND NORMA AND FRANK ASKED ABOUT AND MY PARTNER RYAN STEVE ALONG WITH OTHER FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES. I JUST WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR LOVE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT IT I CAN TRICK MEANS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR OF MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS BOTH BOARD MEMBERS BUT ALSO OUR STAFF. BUT I'VE COME TO FIND HERE IN MY FIRST TERM IS JUST INCREDIBLE PASSION AND DEDICATION AND LEADERSHIP. AMONGST OUR STAFF AND JUST TRULY UNFORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO WORK FOR AND WITH THEM ARE THESE LAST FOUR YEARS AND I JUST. REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC SERVANTS DON'T GET PAID KNOWLEDGE MEANT THEY CAN PROPERLY DESERVED. AND IN THESE TIMES WITH SO MANY CHALLENGES FACING US IT REALLY IS OUR GOVERNMENT. INSTITUTIONS ARE WITH OUR SELF GOVERNANCE HERE AS A SOCIETY THAT REALLY COMEINTO PLAY AND ARE KEY IN HELPING US ALL COLLECTIVELY MAKE BETTER. DECISIONS TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. THERE ARE NO SHORTAGES OF CHALLENGE. CERTAINLY HIGH I COME YOU NOW. IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT FOUR YEARS AGO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS ONE OF OUR WETTEST YEARS ON RECORD. AND HERE NOW- TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FIND OURSELVES. IN AND AN INCREDIBLY DEEP DROUGHT WITH WILDFIRES AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS REALLY IN ITS FULL FORCE UPON US ALL. IF AS IF WE DIDN'T NEED A REMINDER OF THE RECENT IPCC REPORT AS MADE CLEAR THAT WE REALLY AREN'T AN INFLECTION POINT AND GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO. ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS BRINGING UPON US BUT OTHER CHALLENGES THAT ARE CERTAINLY. PART OF THIS COLLECTIVE RECONCILIATION BUT I TRULY FEEL WE'RE ALL MONTHS. AND NO MORE- AT A SPACE THAN WITH OUR WATER SECTOR. IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT THE STATE BOARD NOW IS A FIFTY YEAR INSTITUTION AT THIS POINT. ARE YOU LOOK AT PORTER COLOGNE WHICH IS A MODEL FOR THE CLEAN WATER ACT NATIONALLY. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE. APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS INTO PLACE TO PROTECT CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND HELP MANAGE BEST OUR RESOURCES OUT INTO THE FUTURE. IN THE FIFTY YEARS SINCE A QUARTER COLOGNE WAS PASSED IN THIS INSTITUTION THAT I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEING PART OF HELPING LEAD- HAS AS- YET MADE AN IMPACT IMPROVING WATER QUALITY. BOB BAER BRINGING TO COMPLIANCE AT WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS AND BEGINNING TO STAUNCH THE CHALLENGES THAT. WERE PLAGUING OUR COMMUNITIES FOR SO LONG. BUT WE STILL HAVE SO MANY MORE CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US WE HAVE IF YOU WILL ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS THAT WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT. AND I DON'T LIKE THE BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH THE BOARD IS PROBABLY INVESTED SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THAT'S IN WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS FOR WATER CAPTURE. WATER RECYCLING GROUNDWATER CLEANUP- WE ALSO HAVE TO REINVEST NOT JUST IN THE BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IN THE PEOPLE INFRASTRUCTURE OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND THE WAY THAT WE RESOURCE DOWN TO ACCOMPLISH THESE REALLY CRITICAL GOALS. CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE WAY AS SHOWN THAT. CLEAN AND CLEAN AIR BE THE- OF. TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ECONOMY AND HAVE TO BE THE BASIS FOR OUR MODERN ECONOMY. BUT WE HAVE AGAIN A LOT OF WORK STILL LEFT TO DO. AND SO I'M I'M PROUD AND FORTUNATE TO BE AT THE BOARD AT IT AT THIS TIME. I'M I'M DOING MY BEST TO ENSURE THAT THE BOARD IS RESPONDING HERE IN DROUGHT CERTAINLY BOTH IN OUR CAPACITY. IN WATER RIGHTS IN OUR ADMINISTRATION OF THEIR OF BUT ALSO AND IT'S RESPONDING TO COMMUNITIES WITH DRINKING WATER CHALLENGES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WAS THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT BROUGHT THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER TO THE BOARD. ONLY ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO AND IN THAT FIVE TO SIX YEARS I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. THAT MAKE MORE ACCOUNTABLE THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM BUT IMPORTANTLY BEGIN TO REALLY CLOSE THE GAP. AND THAT WE KNOW EXIST START COMMUNITIES TOO OFTEN BASED OFF OF RACE. AND THAT ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE WATER AND SANITATION IS THE BASIS FOR ANY ODERN. ECONOMY AND FOR ANY ANY COMMUNITY THAT IS GOING TO HAVE THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AT AND SO I JUST WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE AND IT KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CHALLENGES STILL OUT THERE. BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT WE THAT WE COLLECTIVELY THROUGH. OUR OUR MANY INSTITUTIONS GOVERNING AT THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL CAN CAN MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH THIS AND CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO. THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WANT TO SEE IN THE TIME AHEAD SO THANK YOU. THANK. YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THOSE VERY SUBSTANTIVE OPENING COMMENTS- SENATOR LAYERED WOULD YOU LIKE TO KICK US OFF AND THEN I'LL GO THE VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR STAND. OF I SHOULD SAY JUST AT THE OUTSET THAT- IT THAT MISTRUST GIVE ALL WAS DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR FEDERAL WATER AFFAIRS FOR TWO YEARS WHEN I WAS SECRETARY FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND HE WAS OUR POINT PERSON ON THE GROUND IN WASHINGTON WITH. THE FEDERAL AGENCIES AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND- HAD AN EXEMPLARY ROW RECORDS SO JUST IN THIS DISCUSSION STARTS WITH A LITTLE HEAD START. OF WITH ME IN TERMS OF HIS US SERVICE. AND WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TALK ABOUT THE SUBSIDIES SHOES AND I WANT TO GO THROUGH- TWO OR THREE OF THEM HERE AND WOULD WE HAVE TO TALK- ARE USED FIVE OF OUR DAYS DURING THE BREAK. TO HAVE DOWNTIME AND I WENT TO THE CITY MENDOCINO ART WHICH WAS IN THE PROCESS OF DRYING OUT- OF. THEY ARE I'M CONFIDENT AFTER THIS DIG THAT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THEY RUN OUT OF WATER BEFORE THE WINTER COMPLETELY ENOUGH TO CLOSE DOWN THE CITY AND SO IT LEADS TO. A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE OF THE WATER BOARD JURISDICTION IN THIS AREA. AND I THOUGHT I'D START WITH JUST. ARE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM WAS MOVED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO THE WATER BOARD BECAUSE OF A BELIEF THAT NEED NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE ENERGY. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS COULD YOU CHARACTERIZE HOW IT'S BEEN RUNNING- UNDER. THE WATER BOARD. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DID AMAZING WORK WITH WITH THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER AND SO MY COMMENTS HERE ARE OUR KNOWLEDGE AND THAT IT WAS A DISCUSSION HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE MAYBE WHERE THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER MIGHT FIT INTO THE FUTURE. AND HOW AND WHERE AND HOW IT MIGHT MY BEST ACCOMPLISH SOME OF ITS MISSION IN THE WATER BOARD'S WHAT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE VISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WHICH ALREADY HAD THE STATE REVOLVING FUNDS WITH THE CLEAN WATER ACT AT THE ON THE CLEAN WATER SIDE THOSE ARE. ARE GOING TO BE IN THE WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS BUT OTHER OTHER CLEAN WATER PROJECTS AND- I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IT IS GONE INCREDIBLY WELL I AM INCREDIBLY. PROUD OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN TE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT'S NO- EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME BUT WE IN THAT TIME WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS BEEN ABLE TO BEGIN TO ACCELERATE OUR RESPONSE TO COMMUNITIES THAT. DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND THEN WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER IS A GENERATIONAL THESE ARE COMMUNITIES HERE ARE ARE OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW. TEN TWENTY YOUR YEARS WITH STRUGGLING WITH SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. AND HERE THE STATE HAS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ESTABLISHED YET THE FUND TO HELP EVEN CLOSE THAT GAP KNOWING THAT. YOU LOOK AT THE TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS AND- YOU USUALLY NEED TO BE A SYSTEM OF SCIENCE TO HAVE THE LEGAL. FINANCIAL AND AN ENGINEERING- IT SORT. BOOKS ON TAP TO BE ABLE TO PULL THE PROJECT THROUGH TO COMPLETION AND FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH THOSE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO PULL IT BUT BRING A PROGRAM TO CONSTRUCTION- IT IT IS IT IS MEANT THAT WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH GREATER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND HELP. BRIDGE BACK THAT DIVIDE AND THAT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE WORK TO SEE HAPPENS IS A DIVISION OF DRINKING WATERS COME TO THE BOARD MEMBER SAFER PROGRAM AND. BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE ARE STRUCTURE- RIGHT WHICH IS. AS WELL KNOW OVER SIXTY. GOVERNOR APPOINT- AT AT THE REGIONAL AND STATE BOARD LEVEL WHICH AT THE STATE LEVEL THERE'S FIVE OF US. BUT YOU KNOW PUBLIC PUBLICLY ACCOUNTABLE AND APPOINTED INDIVIDUALS I FEEL JUST IT. IT MEANS THAT WE JUST HAVE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE PROGRAM AND SO- HAVE BEEN VERY HEARTENED WITH THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. WELL THANK YOU AND IT AS A MATTER OF FACT WE CONFIRMED A FEW OF THOSE REGIONAL BOARD MEMBERS IN THE MOTION WHILE YOU WERE WAITING SO- SOMETHING WE DO AND- AND ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THAT ONE. IT'S OF HI THIS ISSUE WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT. THIS SMALL FARM WORKER COMMUNITY IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY HAD CONTAMINATED WATER. AND YET BECAUSE OF ONE BIG. BUSINESS INTEREST IN THE AREA THEY WERE NOT CONSIDERED A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND WE WORKED REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE WATER FOR TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD DISADVANTAGE BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR THE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THAT WASN'T THE INITIAL TAKE ON THE RULES ARE. WOULD YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE ON ISSUES LIKE THAT AS BOARD SO THAT WE CAN JUST TRY TO. GET JUSTICE WHEN THOSE SITUATIONS HAPPEN. DEFINITELY CENTER HIGH NOTES- THAT SOMETIMES- ARE YOU WE GET PASSED DOWN RULES FACT HAVE FROM FROM FROM OUR PROGRAMS THAT CAN SEEM INFLEXIBLE OR BUREAUCRATIC. AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN VERY MUCH SO TO ENSURING THAT WE BEST UNDERSTAND WHERE WHERE FLEXIBILITY IS INTO VERY MUCH EXPRESS IT AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO. POPULATION CAPS AND HOW THEY TIE INTO CERTAIN FUNDING PROGRAMS FOR US CAN BE SOMETIMES VERY FRUSTRATING AND CANDIDLY WE CONTINUE TO SEE LARGER COMMUNITIES OF SIZE. STRUGGLING WITH WITH A LOT OF THE SAME CHALLENGES MANY OF OUR SMALLER SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN FACING WITH FOR YEARS AND SO IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO BE FLEXIBLE WITH OUR PROGRAMS AND MAKE SURE WE DON'T JUST HAVE. OUR NUMBERS IN PLACE THAT- DON'T APPROPRIATELY CAPTURED OF THE NEEDS THANK YOU THANK YOU N. A. N. IT LEADS TO. THE NEXT OF MY TWO QUESTIONS AND IT'S HAS TO DO WITH THE CULTURE AND I THINK OTHER PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT THE LARGER CULTURE AND THEIR TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES DIVERSITY AND OTHERS. THAT THAT ARE. REALLY WORTHY OF LOOKING AT BUT- THE ONE WE HAD OUR MEETING TALKED ABOUT I WAS AWARE ONE PARTICULAR WATER RIGHTS SITUATION THAT IS IN MY HOME AREA THAT TOOK FOUR YEARS ED AND I TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS SAID TO ME AFTERWARDS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS IS ONE OF THE QUICKEST ONES WE'VE DONE. IT AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A WHOLE ISSUE OF RESPONSIVENESS. AND IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO EXPEDITIOUSLY THAT YOU ADD FOR THEM. ASK FOR THEM COULD YOU SPEAK TO JUST SORT OF. LIKE THE CULTURE OF THE AGENCY WITH REGARD TO BEING RESPONSIVE AND HOW YOU'VE WORKED ON THAT AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE WAYS YOU'VE ADDRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. AT THANK YOU SENATOR. YOU KNOW I- I WOULD HAVE IT THE PUBLIC SEE EACH OF THE FIVE STATE BOARD MEMBERS HAVE SOME SPECIALIZATION- AND HI MY SEAT IS THE PUBLIC ONE AND SO I FIND MYSELF OFTEN. CONTEMPLATING WHAT IS IT THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE BRINGING THEM TO THE BOARD I THROUGH THE PUBLIC SEAT AND RESPONSIVENESS TO THE NEEDS. ARE AND IN TRANSPARENCY TOWARD DECISION MAKING ARE SUCH A STRONG PILLAR TO THAT TO WORK THE WAY I SEE I REALLY BUT I NEED TO BRING AS A LENDS TO MY WORK. SO WHEN IT COMES TO ANY CRITICISMS AROUND. THAT SORT OF THE SLOW PACE OF RESPONSE FOR OR OTHERWISE- I NEED FOR US TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT IN OUR IN OUR DECISION MAKING- I TAKE IT VERY PERSONALLY AND I AND I AND I TRY TO. UNDERSTAND HOW BEST WE CAN- WE CAN BRIDGE THAT AND WHAT I'VE DONE IS FOCUSED ON OUR OUR WEBSITE OTHER OTHER WACKY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION THAT HELP FOLKS UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHEN. I THINK THAT WHAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS THAT TAKES RESOURCES IN ORDER TO BE RESPONSIVE AS AN AGENCY. AND THEY'RE I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT THROUGH THE SAFER PROGRAM THE STATION AFFORDABLE FUND WAS ESTABLISHED WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF FOLKS IN OUR- OUR OFFICE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. AND SO WE HAVE NOW. ARE MORE INDIVIDUALS AND IN OUR IN OUR AGENCY THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON LEARNING TO BETTER BE RESPONSIVE. HOW LEARNING HOW TO COMMUNICATE SOMETIMES A VERY TECHNICAL WORK AT THE BOARD IN A WAY THAT UP AT COMMUNITIES CAN UNDERSTAND OR SEE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND KNOW THAT. THERE ARE DIFFERENT AUDIENCES AND LEVELS OF INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO BECOME BANG SO THAT ARE KIND OF HIGHER LEVEL THE OF THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION CONTINUE TO HAVE RESOURCES LIKE. IN OUR WEBSITE TO BE BETTER AND MORE RESPONSIVE HAS BEEN IMPORTANT. BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE PROGRAM. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS WELL IMPORTANT TO FOR THAT WE HAVEN'T OF WATER RIGHTS OF WAY QUALITY. OF DRINKING WATER AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND EACH ONE OF THOSE- MAY HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO- THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE WORK OF THE PROJECT. BUT ALWAYS VERY OPEN TO HELPING TO UNDERSTAND. HOW WE CAN BE BETTER AND MORE RESPONSIVE. AND I'M SURE WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU OVER TIME AND AS PRICKLY AROUND BUDGET ISSUES AND OTHER THINGS JUST MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS. IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND MY LAST QUESTION. IS OBVIOUSLY AND I BET EVERYBODY WANNA TALK ABOUT THIS ON THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DROUGHT. A RATHER SEVERE ONE. AND I READ THE NEWS ACCOUNTS OF THE BOARD'S DECISION WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST. DELTA WATER RIGHTS. AND I HAD SOME CONCERNS BASED ON THE NEWS ACCOUNTS AND SO IN OUR MEETING I ASKED YOU ABOUT IT AND- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT MORE IN EVIDENCE IN THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS THAT HELP EXPLAIN THIS DECISION AND ONE OF THE SURPRISES TO ME. WAS WHEN I HEARD THAT MY CLOSE FRIEND TOM BIRMINGHAM AND WESTLANDS WATER DISTRICT SUPPORTED WHAT THE BOARD DID WHICH YOU WOULD NOT GET FROM THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS AND SO I WAS WONDERING. IF YOU MIGHT TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT IN A WAY THAT. THAT WE COULD CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DID HOW PEOPLE WIND UP AND WHAT THE IMPACT OF YOUR DECISION IS GOING TO BE. THANK YOU SENATOR I'LL TRY MY BEST TO DISTINCT AND BRIEF- WATER RIGHTS. AND IF THE DISCUSSION AROUND IT CAN CAN TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE BUT I THINK IT'S THERE'S A PRETTY SPENT SIMPLE FUNDAMENTALS. AMONGST THAT WORK AS AS WE ALL KNOW THAT WATER RATES SYSTEM IS HOW WE ALLOCATE WATER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YEAH IT IS IT IS NOT LOST ON ME BUT IS ACTUALLY ONLY THE THIRD TIME. IN THIS TRIAL NOW THAT THE BOARD HAS ACTUALLY CURTAILED RIGHTS MEANING WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE HOTEL BECAUSE THE HYDROLOGY IS SO POOR. AND OTHERWISE WE HAVE A PRETTY LIGHT TOUCH ON OUR WATER RATES ADMINISTRATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO THAT WE BEGAN REQUIRING YEARLY REPORTING FROM ALL OF OUR WATER RIGHTS HOLDERS OTHER DIVERSIONS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR SO YOU THINK OF A WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM IN ITS ADMINISTRATION. IT IT CAN BE PRETTY SIMPLE HERE IT'S ABOUT WHO'S TAKING WHAT OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND WHEN AND- MEETING IT TO BE A TAG TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY HYDROLOGICALLY AVAILABLE. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY COMPLICATED THING AS SIMPLE OF A CONCEPT IS A CAN SOUND. AND SO- THERE'S JUST A INCREDIBLE NEED FOR US TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THE WATER RIGHT SYSTEM IS HERE AND CAN BE RESPONSIVE. IN THE FACE OF DROUGHT IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO THE BOARD'S ACTION WAS TO. DO WHAT WE CAN ALL SEE THAT QUITE CLEARLY WHICH IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER TO FILL ALL THE RIGHTS IN THE WATERSHED. AND SO WE NEED TO BEGIN TO CURTAIL THOSE IN A WAY THAT HELP US KEEP GAP TO PROTECT THEM AND KEEPING CRITICAL ARTICLES HERE IN MIND WHICH ARE LIKE. WHICH INCLUDES KEEPING WATER UP IN OUR RESERVOIRS WHAT WE WERE SEEING WAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DEPLETIONS MEANING WATER THAT WAS BEING. RELEASED FROM THE RESERVOIRS WASN'T MAKING IT TO THE DELTA DEPLETIONS BEFORE WATER MADE OUT TO THE DELTA SO. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE BOARD WAS NEEDING TO ACT- BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PRESERVE AS MUCH WATER NOW AS WE CAN IN OUR RESERVOIRS IN ANTICIPATION. OF A CONTINUED DR YEAR. AND SO- YEAH THE COVER. I MAYBE SOMETIMES MAKE ITS KIND OF A GOOD OR BLACK BAD BLACK OR WHITE SORT OF- ACTION AND THAT THE BOARD DID SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY RIVAS OR INTEREST TO. A LOT OF- THE COMMUNITIES OUT THERE FARMERS PARTICULARLY. AND I THINK WHAT IS BIG THE- REALITY IS THAT WE NEED TO BE. AT ENSURING THAT THE WATER RATES SYSTEM IS WORKING THAT WE NEED TO BE CURTAILING IN TIMES OF DROUGHT. THAT'S HOW WE PROTECT ALL OF OURSELVES COLLECTIVELY OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THE WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM ITSELF. AND THAT'S WHY YOU SAW A NUMBER OF- AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS ACTUALLY INCLUDING THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY- ED CONTRACTORS AND GROWERS. BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BOARD'S ACTION NOT BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. REQUIRES US TO ACTUALLY ENSURE THAT. INDIVIDUALS ARE TAKING WATER OUT OF THE SYSTEM WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO IT OR WHEN WE'RE NOT ABLE ABLE TO MEET- REALLY CRITICAL. NEED TURNER NEEDS. MORE THANK YOU BECAUSE I THINK THAT ANSWER JUST SPOKE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITUATION. THE FACT THAT DID IT IS MORE UNDERSTANDABLE I APPRECIATE THE- OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO. SUPPORTING THE CANDIDATE WE GET TO ABOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED MADAM BY SHERIFF. THANK YOU AND- THANK YOU MR VAL- FOR YOUR- COMMITMENT TO WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX POLICY ISSUES. WE HAVE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATORS HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING TO ME BECAUSE I DO NOT. I'M NOT I'M NOT IN AN AREA THAT IS- CERTAINLY WERE CHALLENGED BUT NOT TO THE DEGREE THAT HAS GONE ON WITH THE DELTA AND ALL OF ON THE ON THE IMPACT OF BAD EFFECT I'M- REPRESENTAR. COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO AND BOTH OF THOSE COUNTY STAND OUT I BELIEVE IN ADDRESSING. THE PREVENTION THE LONGER TERM- WATER RESOURCES NEEDS ORANGE COUNTY A LEADER IN THE RECYCLED WATER TO RECHARGE THE GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS. EX EXTREMELY- SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND CERTAINLY AND SAN DIEGO AND IN MY DISTRICT IN CARLSBAD. AB SOUTH PLANTATION BUT BASICALLY THE DREAMABOUT I STARTED WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. AND BECAME REALITY WHEN I'VE GOT TO THE SENATE SO- FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE IDEA OF THE DREAMS THAT YOU CAN DO THESE THINGS AND- THEN THEY THEY DO A FINALLY APPEAR BAD INCETIVE IS NEEDED. RESOURCES FINANCIAL ARE NEEDED AND CERTAINLY COMMITMENT OF OUR POLICYMAKERS ARE NEEDED. SO MY QUESTION A YEAR OF. DOES THE BOARD HAVE A ROLE- HANNAH. AT INCENTIVIZING IN ADVANCING OF THESE TYPE OF PROJECTS AS WE SEE OURSELVES IN THE FOOT BEER DROUGHT NOW. IN CERTAINLY- IT IS CYCLICAL WE KNOW THAT WE ARE A DESERT. COMMITTED OURSELVES TO SOMETHING. BEAUTIFUL THE OTHER BAD TOM THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE ISSUE WITH WHERE DO WE GET WATER WHEN WE HIT ONE OF THESE AND THESE TWO PROGRAMS ARE SEEM TO HAVE. GONE UP QUITE A DEFENSE IN ADDRESSING THAT YET THEY SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES THAT STAND OUT IN THE STATE AND I I'M WONDERING IF THE BOARD DOESN'T HAVE A ROLE THERE SHOULDN'T HAVE A ROLE IN INCENTIVIZING MORE OF THEIR FOR. ESPECIALLY IN OUR CENTRAL VALLEY SO I KIND OF LAID OUT IN YOUR LAP AND I'LL LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND WHAT YOU MIGHT DO- ALICE THE TEAR. THE LEADER GOING FORWARD TO- I I'M GONNA SAY GET A BETTER PERSPECTIVE ALL A BETTER CONCEPT AND A BETTER ACCEPTANCE THAT THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW ARE SO DETRIMENTAL TO THE ENVIRONMENT AS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED PERHAPS SOMEONE LIKE MY COLLEAGUES. ARE MENTIONED ABOUT HOW THE DELTA. OF BABEL SIGNED WITH MISPERCEPTIONS SO- LET ME HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS. THANK YOU SOME FASTER- WE HAVE A AND THANKFULLY AND PROBABLY HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTING TO THESE WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS BOTH FINANCIALLY AND REGULATORY- I'LL NOTE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON REGULATIONS TO MOVE TO DIRECT POTABLE REUSE- AS YOU KNOW. AS CENTER THOSE THAT THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN THE STATE ARE INDIRECT- WATER RECYCLING WHEN IT COMES TO DRINKING WATER MEANING. THAT IT EITHER GOES TO A GROUNDWATER BASIN LIKE AN ORANGE COUNTY- OR MIGHT GO TO A DRINKING WATER RESERVOIR BEFORE MAKING IT TO THAN A DRINKING WATER TREATMENT PLANT- AND WE HAVE PROJECTS LIKE THAT IN SAN DIEGO. AND ANOTHER OTHERS POPPING UP IN THE STATE. AB WHAT WORD THE NEXTGENERATION OF PROJECTS WILL BE OUR DIRECT POTABLE REUSE PROJECTS MEANING. THAT THE WATER THAT'S RECYCLED WILL GO DIRECTLY INTO DISTRIBUTION AND DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. THIS IS A HUGELY HI IT IS NOT DONE LIGHTLY WORK FOR CENTURIES- AT MELANIA- WE HAVE KNOWN THAT WE HAVE TO SEPARATE OUR SANITATION SYSTEMS AND OUR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. AND TO COMBINE THE CHU IS TIPPED TO OPEN UP. THE POSSIBILITY FOR PATHOGENS AND OTHER CHALLENGES AND SO. WHAT THIS OUR STATE HAS BEEN A LEADER AND IS STRIVING WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS. AND NOW THESE DIRECT POTABLE REUSE PROJECTS ARE THAT NEXT GENERATION SO AS WE DEVELOP THOSE REGULATIONS WE ALREADY SEE PROJECTS IN LOS ANGELES. AND WITH WITH THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT AND L. A. COUNTY SAN COMING TO PROVE THAT BEEN DISCUSSING COMING TO FRUITION. AND OTHER PLACES IN THE STATE THAT WILL TAKE THESE REGULATIONS AND DEVELOP THAT NEXT GENERATION OF PROJECTS. SO WE HAVE TO BE READY TO INVEST IN THEM AND WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE BEEN. CONTINUING TO ADD WE HAVE A RECYCLE WATER POLICY AT THE STATE WATER BOARD- WE'RE LOOKING TO BE UPDATING THAT WE RECENTLY MADE SOME CHANGES GIVEN TO DATA GATHERING. SO THAT WE BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH WATER RECYCLING IS GOING ON IN THE STATE AND CONTINUE TO YOU PRIVATE. AND METRIC WHY IT'S NOT ON MY WE DO WITH OXNARD CHANGE GOALS YOU KNOW THE MEASURE IT LET'S LET'S THE POLICY. AND THE PHOENIX OF IT AND WITH WATER RECYCLING. RECORD YOUR COMPLETELY SPOT ON CENTER THOSE ARE THESE ARE THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PROJECTS THAT WE NEED TO BE DEVELOPING AND INVESTING AS WE MAKE THIS GENERATIONAL REINVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE GOING TO HELP MAXIMIZE OUR SUPPLIES GET US THROUGH BROWSE AND CONTINUE TO TAKE HIM BACK SEMIS JUST THE USE OF THE RESOURCES. WE HAVE AT HAND NOW AND I THINK THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AND YOUR POINT THE CENTRAL VLLEY. HAS ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF PROJECTS OUT THERE BUT NEEDS AND THERE ARE OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT MORE AND SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO INVEST IN THOSE IMPROPER THAT THE BOARD. AND BANKS WILL TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THE GOVERNOR FOR. PROVIDING THE BOARD ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS NOW IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WASTE WATER DRINKING WATER SYSTEM. AND LOOKING TO SEE HOW WE CAN ALSO BROKE OUT FOR WATER RECYCLING. AND WHAT ABOUT THE CELL SINCE THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND CERTAINLY ALL THE SAN DIEGO- EXPERIENCE FIVE HAS BEYOND ALL QUITE SUCCESSFUL. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. YEAH I THINK THAT LIKE. IT IS A TOOL AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE I AM FOR COMMUNITIES TO ASSESS SOME MONTHS THEIR PORTFOLIO OF WATER PROJECTS OUT THERE IMPORTANTLY THE BOARD ACTUALLY HAS A D. CELL POLICY- IT IS THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE BY WHICH- PROJECTS MAKE THEIR WAY AFTER REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD AND I THINK THAT. WHAT IS PROBABLY AN AND HELPFUL IN THE OFFING IS MAYBE A DISCUSSION ABOUT UPDATING THAT POLICY TO SAY HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT IT'S THEIR TO CONTINUE TO. PROTECT CERTAINLY OUR WATER RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE LONG TERM FOR ALL OF OUR PROJECTS AND ALL OF OUR WATERSHEDS BUT HOW DO WE THEN ALSO INCENTIVIZE THOSE PROJECTS THAT DON'T DO THAT HARM AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TED TO CONTINUE TO BETTER FIGURE OUT. AND UNLOCK. OPTION OF THE CELL IN THE STATE NOW SAY THAT THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF A NUMBER OF. SMALLER PROJECTS THAT I AM AWARE OF THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE CONTINUE TO SHOW THE INNOVATION AND SUPPLEMENTING LOCAL WATER PORTFOLIOS WITH THE SOUTH END OF BRACKISH WATER THE CELEBRATE AS WELL AND WE JUST NOTE AND NOT TO JUST. TALK TO MUCH BUT I KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AS A NEW PROGRAM- LOCATED HERE IN THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE CELL BRACKISH YOU SELL BEGIN TO CONTINUE. TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROJECTS ARE HERE FOR US. WELL THANK YOU FOR ON YOUR ANSWERS THOSE SO WERE- OF TOP PRIORITY COME. OF MINE SO THANKS AGAIN AND CERTAINLY FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM FOR TEN- WELL WELCOME SIR DEFINITELY TO THE COMMITTEE AND MISSED A LOT OF NICE THINGS ABOUT YOU BEFORE I START QUESTIONING YOU.

AND WHOSE LOST ITS ONLY OPERATING WELL AND THEN. WHEN I EXPLAINED WHAT WAS GOING ON YOU ALREADY HAD YOUR HANDS AROUND IT AND- ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU SAID IS THAT- I DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WATER IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. AND SO I REALLY DID APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE STRUGGLE- S. THINKING THAT YEAH YOU KNOW MAYBE REPUBLICAN TO SIX AREN'T AS- YOU KNOW AS IF I WAS A FAVORITE BUT NOT AS WELL TAKE CARE OF AS DEMOCRATS DISTRICTS BUT USER HAVE- GONE BEYOND. ANY AGENCY THAT I'VE EVER WORKED WITH AND THAT HAS GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND TO MAKE SURE THAT- PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE OF INCLUDING- THE NEEDLE SITUATION THAT WE HAD AND SOME OF THE STUFF UP AND TULARE COUNTY. SO I DO WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME ABOUT THE ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS AND HOW I FELT LIKE THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD KIT ADDRESS. I DO TOO- YOU KNOW THE ILLEGAL- AT THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY THAT GOES ON DIGGING WELLS THAT ARE PERMITTED. TAKING WATER THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT THEIR WATER TO TAKE- AND- YOU KNOW WHEN WE BUST THESE ILLEGAL. MARIJUANA GROWS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD FOUND OUT. IS THAT TIME TO HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOU YOU EDUCATED ME ON WHAT WAS IN YOUR PURVIEW AND WAS IN A LOCAL PER VIEW SO THAT WAS VERY BENEFICIAL AS WELL. SO I JUST FIRST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING AVAILABLE THANK YOU FOR- SCHERING YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER YOU MAY REGRET THAT ONE DAY. WE HAVE M. M. BIG CATASTROPHIC WATER ISSUES AND THAT ARE NEEDING TO BE ADDRESSED BUT M. I APPRECIATE YOUR WISDOM ON EVERYONE OF SUBJECT MATTER SAID I IF I'M BROUGHT TO YOU. SO- AND- SO- FIRST QUESTION I WOULD ASK YOU IS ABOUT THE ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS WE DID TALK A LITTLE BIT WE EXCHANGED SOME TEXT MESSAGES AND EMAILS AND YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR STAFF REACH OUT TO ME- ABOUT IT OR MY STAFF A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- I THOUGHT MAYBE IN YOUR PURVIEW IS THE ILLEGAL CHEMICAL- THAT CARBON FUERAN WILL QUARTER TEASPOON WILL KILL AN ADULT PERSON AND IT'S ONE OF THE HIGHLY CONTAMINATED CHEMICALS THAT ARE FOUND IN THESE ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS. AND I KNOW WITH PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN- THOUSANDS OF THESE GROWS HAVE ENDED UP ON OUR DESERT FLOOR HE CAME IN- THERE SQUATTERS MOSTLY AS A IT'S NOT SOMEBODY YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO GO AFTER THE LAND LEASE THERE'S LANDOWNERS IF THEY'RE LEASING PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING YOU KNOW LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND FIND A WAY TO STOP THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE JUST SQUATTERS ON OUR DESERT ALLEY FLOOR HE CAME IN AND THEY JUST PLOW DOWN EVERY JOSHUA TREE IN SIGHT AND WHEN SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE TO PAY YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR A JOSHUA TREE REMOVAL IN ORDER TO HOOK UP TO THIS SYSTEM WATER DO YOU KNOW THAT SEWER SYSTEM. AND BECAUSE REQUIRED TO BY LAW AND IS THE CHEMICAL BASE GETTING BACK. TO YOUR PER VIEW OR A DIFFERENT WATER AND AGENCY. IT WOULD IT WOULD DEPEND ON- THE ACTUAL INCIDENT- AND HERE WE ARE GETTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO KIND OF HE'S OUT- WHERE AUTHORITIES ARE BUT I KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE WORKING WITH COUNTIES ON ILLEGAL GROWS AND GO RIDING ALONG ON ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS AND WAR. WHEN IT COMES TO ILLEGAL DIVERSIONS OF SURFACE WATER PERHAPS- THOSE ARE OR WHERE OUR FORTIES OUR FIRMEST THE CHALLENGE BECOMES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ILLEGAL WELLS AND OR- GROUNDWATER BUT WE'LL MAKE SURE TO FURTHER TEASE OUT BUT I KNOW FOR SURE THAT WE DO HAVE A ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCING AND RESPONDING TO WATER QUALITY CHALLENGES ALONG WITH SOME OF THE NUMBER OF OUR SISTER AGENCIES- THAT HANDLE PESTICIDES AND TOXICS AS WELL SO- WILL BE GLAD TO MAKE SURE AND WE GET. BACK TO YOU I JUST MORE DETAIL AROUND WHAT ARE AUTHORITIES ARE AND WHAT CASES THE BOARD CAN HELP WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCEMENT THANK YOU I'M THINKING AGAIN AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER YOU KNOW YOU ARE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARED WITH ME. AND THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT ON THAT THE WATER GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION BECAUSE MY DISTRICT IS VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THAT CHEMICAL THAT THEY FEEL IS GOING INTO THE GROUND WATER. AND THAT'S MY DESERT COMMUNITY I ALSO REPRESENT THE SECOND LARGEST FOOD PRODUCING COUNTY IN THE WORLD A KERN COUNTY AND IN TULARE COUNTY IS THIRD FRESNO IS FIRST. BUT WE KIND OF STAIR STEP DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THIS RECENT WATER TRUMP KERR ACREE TELLEMENT- ORDERS BY THE STDC RCB HAS. KIND OF PUT SOME OF OUR GROWERS IN A LITTLE BIT OF A PANIC IN SO I JUST WONDERED WHEN DECISIONS ARE MADE LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A LIST IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW BUT I CAN PROVIDE IT TO YOU. THERE ARE SEVERAL COMMODITIES GROWN COMMODITIES THAT ARE GROWN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT WE GROW. ALMONDS THE LONG. STASHED USE NINETY NINE. OF THE CUTIES THE HALOS. M. 99% OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT I THINK THERE'S OVER FORTY COMMODITIES THAT WE GROW. IF WE DON'T GROW THOSE COMMODITIES IT ACTUALLY AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS KIND OF OUTLANDISH BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. JUST BASIC AND SIMPLE IF WE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR THAT WE GROW YOU KNOW 99% EASE PRODUCTS AND WE DON'T GROW THEM. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO WATER WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ALLOW THEM TO GROW. AND WHAT HOW DOES THAT DISRUPT THE FOOD SUPPLY AND ARE YOU. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER STATES IN THE NATION OR THE ADMINISTRATION. REGARDING A POSSIBLE DISRUPTION OF THE FOOD SUPPLY FOR THESE COMMODITIES ARE ONLY GROWN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING WATER. THANK YOU SENATOR YEAH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS DROUGHT AND THE PRESSURES THAT IT'S PUTTING ON ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE AG SECTOR IS VERY FRONT OF MIND AND- YOU KNOW WE AT THE BOARD- WHEN IT COMES TO CURTAILMENT. I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. IF THE BOARD DIDN'T CURTAIL IT WOULD MEANT THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO SEE. PEOPLE PULLING WATER OUT OF THE SYSTEM THAT THEY DON'T HAVE REAL LEGAL RIGHT TO AND- I THINK THAT- AND I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS CAN BE THAT THE BOARD'S ACTION ITSELF. THAT CAN LEAD TO THESE THESE THESE CHALLENGES THESE ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO- DESTRUCTION OR JUST TRULY THEY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AND- IMPACT THAT HAS ON ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES- WHEN. THOSE TAX REVENUES IN THOSE JOBS AREN'T THERE IN THE AG SECTOR BECAUSE OF DROUGHT- AND SO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW I VERY MUCH YOUR THE FRUSTRATION OF THE BOARD'S ACTIONS. AND A FEELING THAT THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF THESE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO AGAIN REMEMBER THAT. THE PROUDEST IS CAUSING INORDINATE AMOUNT OF IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK WE HAVE TO BE READY TO RESPOND AND SO. THERE I THINK WE DO NEED TO SEE SUPPORT FOR A BI I COMMUNITY SAID TO WHETHER THIS DROUGHT BUT IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE LONG TERM. ON HOW WE CAN BEST IMPLEMENT SIGMOD IN A WAY THAT IT IS FAIR BUT RECOGNIZES THAT. WE WE'VE MET OUR PHYSICAL LIMITS IN MANY WAYS IN THE STATE AND NEED TO. BEGIN TO REALLY RESPOND TO AN ACKNOWLEDGE- THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE. SO WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD AND DISRUPTION OR THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS DROUGHT WHICH IS WEST WIDE AS YOU KNOW SENATOR- AND WHAT THAT MEANS- I. IT IS FURTHER DISCUSSION TO HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THE FLAG ON THAT- AND WOOD. REMEMBER THAT THINGS LIKE FOR. ARE ACTUALLY WE BASS MANAGE THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES LIKE DROUGHT IN A WAY THAT- DOESN'T JUST LEAVE US AS HONOR A RACE TO THE BOTTOM- AND WE HAVE TO. BE VERY AWARE AND ACKNOWLEDGING ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AND IMPACTS FOR COMMUNITIES AND RESPOND TO THEM. AND SUPPORT THEM. BOTH HERE IN THE SHORT TERM CERTAINLY YOU KNOW AT THE EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER WORKED RICHMOND COMES TO MIND ON ON HOW- WE'RE NEEDING TO RESPOND BUT IT IS THE LARGER. DISCUSSION AROUND OUR ECONOMIES AND HOW BEST TO CONTINUE. TO HELP THEM TRANSITION TO THE REAR. OF THIS KIND OF. IS CANNOT I ALONG THE CAN I ACROSS IN THERE BECAUSE- KNOW THE ONE THE BENEFITS OF GOING. THE I TO PICK DO IS QUESTION HAS BEEN ASKED DON'T REALLY HAVE TO. BUT ALONG THE CURTAILMENT- LINE OF QUESTIONING AS IT RELATES TO THE IPACTS ON AGATE URBAN WATER USERS. I HAVE A SIMPLE QUESTION AND IT MAYBE IT'S A NAIVE QUESTION BUT- IS THERE WATER OUT THERE THEY CAN BE PURCHASED TO BE PUT INTO THE PUBLIC WATER BANK AND USED TO HELP. OUT ALL ALONG THESE LINES. THANK YOU SENATOR FROM UTAH SAID IN THEIR- AT THANK YOU CENTER WILL BOWL FIRST WITH ALL THE KNOWLEDGE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CURTAILMENTS WHICH AGAIN- REGARDING WATER RIGHTS SO THAT'S IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE HAS A RIGHT TO SURFACE FLOW IN THEIR THIRD THEY'RE DIVERTING AT- AND USING IT IN MANY TIMES THAT MAY BE A CITY. AND SO IN OUR CURTAILMENT ORDERS WHICH HAVE AN EXEMPTION FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY SO- CITIES ARE EXEMPTED FROM FROM THE CURTAILMENT AND IS- AND IN MANY WAYS THE CURTAILMENT IS THERE TO HELP PROTECT- SOURCES FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY THERE I THINK OF THE RUSSIAN RIVER AND THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND HOW. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE PRETENDING WE DIDN'T MEET STORAGE TARGETS AND IT'S TO PREVENT DOWNSTREAM CITIES FROM BEING DISCONNECTED FROM THE RIVER AND THEIR SOURCE OF WATER- SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING THAT IN IN BEING PROTECTED IN THE WATER RIGHT SPACE ADDITIONALLY THERE IS I KNOW DISCUSSION I AND THIS IS MORE WITH OUR OPERATORS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT REALLY MOVE WATER AROUND IN THE STATE. AND THAT WE WORK WITH I'M DIRECTLY AND I'VE I'VE HAD CONVERSATION WITH DIRECTOR NAME AT AND I WAS UNDERSTAND THERE IS SOME SOME DISCUSSION OUT THERE ARE MONTHS URBAN'S AROUND THE POTENTIAL FOR A WATER BANK IF YOU WILL IN THERE YOUR POINT IT'S YOU KNOW HOW BEST TO. HAVE A POOL OF WATER AT LEAST FOR THOSE THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT- IN ORDER TO ACCESS AND IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES SO- MULTI PRONGED THERE AND THE BOARD'S PURVIEW AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE WE HAVE AND ALL OF OUR CALVET ORDERS HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY EXEMPTION SO THAT CITIES ARE ARE PRIORITIZED AND IF YOU WILL AND. IN THEIR ACCESS IN THE WATERS. NO PROBLEM MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION TO- THERE'S A WATER BREAK IN MY- I KNOW YOU PROBABLY ARE AWARE OF THAT. AND WATER MAKING MY DISTRICT SOMEBODY STERN LYNDA RESNICK AND- THEY'VE BEEN DRINKING WATER FOR. QUITE AWHILE AND- SO ANOTHER THING THAT I HAD THAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU IS- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MAIN COMPLAINTS THAT I GET FROM MY GROWERS- IN MY FARMERS THAT PRODUCE FOOD IS A- THE ISSUE THAT. EVEN THOUGH THIS CURTAILMENT THERE ARE UNDER CONTRACT WHERE THEY PAY A CERTAIN OLLAR AMOUNT AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ENTITLED TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER. BUT EVEN THOUGH THE WATER HAS OVER THELAST FEW YEARS BEEN CUT BACK THEY STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT WATER. A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS LIKE GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE AND PUT IN A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE GROCERIES ON THE ON THE BELT AND- PAYING FOR THAT GETTING IT BACKED UP AND THEN WALKING OUT WITH NOTHING- IN THIS CASE OR THERE AN- IT'S KIND OF IT I KNOW IT'S A LOADED QUESTION BUT- IS THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS GOING ON TO REDUCE THE- PRICE THAT- OUR WATER USERS ARE END USERS ARE PAIN. SINCE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE WATER IT THEY WERE PROMISED TO GET. AT THANK YOU I IMPORTANT HERE- TED TO DIFFERENTIATE THAT THERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE ON PROJECT WATER SO EITHER A LOCAL PROJECT FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT OR THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT- OR TWO MAIN PROJECTS OR THEY'RE DIVERTING STRAIGHT FROM A STREAM. AND THEN HAVE A WATER RIGHT- THAT WE'VE WE'VE CURTAILED AND SO THAT I KNOW THAT IS A CHALLENGE FOR SOME YOU KNOW THAT THAT THEY MAY HAVE A WATER RIGHT THEY MAY BE DIVERTED THAT IS NOW CUT OFF AND IN A YEAR LIKE THIS. THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT ON FOR SOME OF ITS ITS CONTRACTORS THERE AT 0% ALLOCATION- THOSE ISSUES OF THE PRICE OF THAT CONTRACT WATER WITH THOSE PROJECTS. THEIR THERE LONG TERM- YEP ABILITY TO DELIVER THOSE AMOUNTS KNOW WHAT IT MEANS FOR THAT THE CONTRACTORS ON THIS PROJECT SO THAT I CAN TRUST AND CITIES ARE OFTEN TIMES- IS AN ISSUE UNLESS THE BOARD'S PURVIEW THOUGH- BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE- ARE ARE AWARE OF AND- AND- IS PART OF THIS. DISCUSSION I READ LARGE AROUND HOW BEST WE ARE MANAGING OUR WATERS- BUT JUST IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE ACTIVITIES OR THE ACTION OF THE BOARD AGREED TELLING. WATER RIGHTS- IS TANGENTIALLY CONNECTED TO THAT THE ISSUES ARE BROUGHT UP WHEN IT COMES TO. GROWERS PAYING FOR WATER NOT RECEIVING IT THROUGH THERE THERE THERE'S BETTER- THE PROJECTS- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY AWARE OF AND WORKING WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THAT SPACE AND- A LOT OF THAT IS WITH THE PROJECT MANAGERS AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT WORK. SOME OF THOSE OTHER LOCAL PROJECTS ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. WITH CERTAINTY IN DELIVERY AND THIS TIME OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN CRISIS. THANK YOU SIR AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME. SO THERE'S A NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINION OUT THERE- THAT CAME OUT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO- A- ON OUTFLOWS THAT WOULD GENERATE MORE RESEARCH MORE. RESOURCES IN WATER RESOURCES TO THAT GROUND I GUESS STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO. IT REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT WENT ON BUT IT WOULD GIVE US TRANCE. WHY AND WHAT'S YOUR ON THE NEW TO PILOT OPINION CAME OUT A COUPLE OF YOUR AGO AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. OR NOT I GUESS. ARE TIED TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND IT'S A IT'S A FEDERAL. ACT THAT. PUTS LIMITS ON. FEDERAL ACTIONS AND PROJECTS IN HERE IMPORTANTLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT AND SO THOSE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS DICTATED AND WERE FIRST DEVELOPED- YOU KNOW WELL THAT. DEPENDING ON WHICH BIOLOGICAL OPINION BUT- IN IN THE LATE AT 200-020-0072 THOUSAND EIGHT. WAS WHEN. ONE OF THE REAL BIOLOGICAL OBJECTS FOR CAME IN WERE PUT INTO PLACE THE REPLACED AS HE SAID. TWO YEARS AGO- AND DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS GOING ON WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I'M NOT PERSONALLY PRIVY TO THOSE BUT I KNOW THAT THEY ARE GOING ON. AND REGARDING WHAT TO DO REGARDING THEIR LAWSUIT THAT THE STATE ENDED UP. TRIGGERING LAST YEAR- WHEN THOSE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WENT INTO- WHEN INTO A FACT AND THE DISAGREEMENT THAT THE STATE HAD. ON THEM- SO- ALL THAT TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THOSE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FROM TWO YEARS AGO ARE STILL. UP FOR DISCUSSION CURRENTLY MY OPINIONS ON THE MARK. IN THEIR- FEDERAL THERE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT I'M REALLY FOCUSED ACTUALLY ON MAKING SURE THAT OUR WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN UPDATE. IS UPDATED I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS ONE- STANDARD IS AN EMERGENCY ROOM APPROACH TO OUR CHALLENGES. WE NEED REALLY- A WHOLE OF SYSTEM WATER SHED WHY. APPROACH TO THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR SPECIES AND ECOSYSTEMS ARE FACING. BECAUSE IT'S AN OVER OVER FOCUSING ON JUST WHAT THE PROJECTS ARE DOING AT THE PUMPS- THAT IS IN PART. WHY WEEK WE NEED TO AND WE HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH PROGRESS I FEEL IN THE REST OF THE WATER SENSE THAT WE NEED AND SO LOOK FORWARD TO. TEACHING US ALL TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT MAKES MOST SENSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE JUST- ACTUALLY- TALES TO WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE OF THE WATER SYSTEM ITSELF. AND THE LAST. QUESTION I HAVE IS THERE IS THERE IS SAM. AS WE WATER S. WATER. TO IN THIS VALLEY THEY A LOT OF INTO. THROUGHOUT STATE HAVE GUARD. A NEW TECHNOLOGY I KNOW YOU'RE AVAILABLE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE QUEEN THE WATER PROJECT- WHERE THEY'VE TAKEN PRODUCE WATER BLENDED IN MADE ACT WATER. WHICH IS- MEETS THE WATER BOARD'S STANDARDS AND THEN THERE'S- THERE'S- OTHER WATER THAT'S BEEN PRODUCED WATER THAT'S BEEN APPROVED BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THAT IT'S KIND OF I GUESS THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT IT'S NOT A REVERSE OSMOSIS SYSTEM BUT IT'S LIKE THAT. IT ACTUALLY GOES INTO MINES ALL THE MINERALS THAT ARE IN THE WATER. OF BORON AND THINGS LIKE THAT- TO REMOVE IT M. AND THEN HAVE THE WATER THAT EXCEEDS THE STANDARDS- FROM STATE WATER BOARD. THERE'S A LOT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE IS ARE YOU OR YOUR TEAM OR DO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ON YOUR TEAM. AND HAVING PEOPLE TALK WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CREATING. I WANNA SAY NEW WATER IT'S NEW WATER NEW USABLE WATER I GUESS. SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS PURSUE- SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT YOU KNOW PROVIDING NEW WATER- FOR THE GOOD OF EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA OR IS THAT. SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT YET. THANK YOU HEY IT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AT LEAST FOR ME VERY TOP OF MIND. WE DON'T HAVE A DEDICATED INNOVATION UNIT OR- TEAM IF YOU WELL THAT IS JUST FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGIES BUT OUR DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER. IT IS THE REGULATORY ARM THAT WOULD APPROVE ANYTHING THAT ANY NEW TECHNOLOGIES ANYTHING NEW THAT COMES ON. THAT IS TRYING TO MEET STANDARDS AND OF DELIVER DRINKING WATER ANY SYSTEM THAT. WOULD LIKE TO SERVE INNOVATOR OR HAVE SOMETHING IMPROVE WOULD GO THROUGH THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER. I HAVE HAD. CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR OUR- DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER HAD TERRAPLANE MESSED. AROUND HOW WE CONTINUE TO INCENTIVIZE TO YOUR POINT. NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE INNOVATING IN THE SPACE OF DELIVERY OF CLEAN WATER. AND WASTE AND HOPEFULLY BRING DOWN THE COST- AND YES YOU KNOW REVERSE OSMOSIS IS OUT THERE IT'S A- TRIED AND TRUE. BUT IT IS ENERGY INTENSIVE IT IS COST INTENSIVE IN SHAREPOINT. THERE ARE. I THINK INNOVATIONS. BEING BEING PULLED TOGETHER. IT WITH PACE IF LIKE LEAST BEEN READING AND TRYING TO KEEP ON TOP OF THE LITERATURE. THE QUESTION IS HOW HOW DOES THAT BECOME IMPLEMENTABLE HOW DOES IT BECOME SOMETHING THAT'S APPROVED. AND REGULATORY REALLY ABLE TO BE INCORPORATED FOR OUR OUR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND- IT'S A GOOD QUESTION WE DON'T LIKE I SAID AS I UNDERSTAND. HAVE RULED DEDICATED UNIT TO THAT BUT IT IS WITHIN OUR PURVIEW AND IT'S BEEN A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION AT THE BOARD SO I APPRECIATE THAT. WELL THANK YOU SIR AND THANK YOU AGAIN NUMBER ONE FOR AND YOUR HELP WITH- MY DISTRICT PERSONALLY AND ALWAYS BEING AVAILABLE. THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING ALL MY QUESTIONS TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE ON THIS VERY- IMPACTFUL SUBJECT MATTER THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW. OUR SENATOR COMELEC WITH. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEMP. AND IT'S A GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN- I. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK YESTERDAY AND- INCREDIBLY- EXCITED ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL BE CONFIRMED AND- BELIEVE EVEN MORE THAT YOU ARE OF THE RIGHT PERSON AT THIS TIME- TO A- STEP BACK INTO THIS POSITION. I HAVE TO SAY IT'S- KIND OF EERIE YOU KNOW WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT. WATER AND DROUGHT AND RELIABILITY- WHILE VERY CLOSE TO US. YOU KNOW PARTS OF CALIFORNIA BURNING DOWN. AND I CAN ACTUALLY SMELL IT YOU KNOW IN THIS ROOM AND OF COURSE THE THING THAT WILL STOP IT IS WATER- WHICH SEEMS TO BE A MORE AND MORE FINITE RESOURCE- AS I MENTIONED TO YOU YOU KNOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES IS CHINATOWN WHICH REALLY TALKS ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE. OF WATER- AND THE COMPLEXITIES OF IT- SO I DO ACT COME FROM LA- I KNOW FOLKS THINK ALL KIND OF THINGS ABOUT LOS ANGELES THERE WAS AN ARTICLE- THAT WAS REFERENCED. THAT THAT REFERENCE DELAY WHEN IT TALKED ABOUT MENDOCINO NOT HAVING ANYMORE WATER THAT TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR STRATEGY AND OUR MUSCLE. IN TERMS OF- HOW WE'RE ABLE TO CONSERVE- BUT IT WE ALSO HAVE VERY SMALL WATER DISTRICTS- THAT STRUGGLE- AS DO OTHER SMALLER DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE WHEN IT COMES TO OUT WATER RELIABILITY. AND CLEAN WATER SO- AND I ACTUALLY HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF DOING A COUPLE OF TOURS. TO VISIT SOME OF THE SMALLER WATER DISTRICTS- OUTSIDE OF MY DISTRICT BUT A. J. SENT TO IT- THAT TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW. HI RAPES BROWN WATER COMING OUT OF THE TAP SOMETIMES NOT HAVING ANY WATER WHICH YOU DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOT FOLKS LIVING IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. SO JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT ASSISTANCE- THE BOARD CAN PROVIDE FOR SMALLER WATER DISTRICTS AND MUNICIPALITIES. IN THEIR PURSUIT OF CLEAN WATER. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER FOR YOUR REMARKS AND IT ISN'T LOST ON ME EITHER- CAN SMELL SMELL SMOKE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MANY COMMUNITIES ARE ARE BEING HARMED AND LIVES- BEING TOUCHED AND AN ARMED HERE AND- AT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THAT IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE THAT SMALL SYSTEMS IN THE STATE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE STATE BOARD I BELIEVE IN WITH SOMEWHERE AROUND OVER THREE THOUSAND. I SYSTEMS THAT WE OVERSEE AND THE STATE AND SOME OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW OUR OUR LARGE URBAN AGENCIES AND YOUR POINT. TOO MANY ARE SMALL STRUGGLING SYSTEMS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HELP US BUILD OUT MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS. I HAD IT WAS WITH GREAT FEDERAL INVESTMENT SUBSIDY AND SUPPORT THAT OUR WASTE WATER AND DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT AND- SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT- WERE WERE WERE BUILT OUT. AND THAT IT WAS REALLY IN THE EIGHTIES AND THE START OF THE EIGHTIES THIS- THIS THIS PROGRESSION FROM INVESTMENT. FROM ON THE FEDERAL SIDE AND INSTEAD OF SHIFTING TO. LOCAL REPAIRS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND IT'S OBVIOUS THAT WE ACT YOU EITHER AND THAT THE COMMUNITY OF SIZE TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. AND CONTINUE DELIVER AND REINVEST IN AND OUR OUR BEER DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN. A LEVEL OF SERVICE OR NOT. AND WE HAVE TOO MANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE OR NOT CATEGORY IN FACT THE STATE WATER BOARD RECENTLY CONDUCTED A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. IT'S NOW A YEARLY JUST ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS OF OUR SYSTEMS. IT INCLUDED ALL OF OUR DOMESTIC WELLS IN THE STATE ALL STATES MALLS MEETING THEIR UNDER FIFTEEN CONNECTIONS. AND THEN THOSE THAT ARE UNDER THIRTY THREE HUNDRED CONNECTIONS AND WHAT WE FOUND WERE WELL OVER SIX HUNDRED SYSTEMS THAT WERE AT RISK. WE WOULD TERM AT RISK OFF OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS AND METHODOLOGIES I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO TAKE  LOOK AT THAT DOCUMENT IT IS. AN INCREDIBLE- FIRST I ROLLED. DIVE INTO SEEN OUR- DATA INFORMATION IS SOLD TEMP. PART OF THIS RISK. BECAUSE IF WE KNOW THE STATUS OF THE SYSTEM WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE AT RISK FOR FAILING AND WE DON'T. GET TO THEM BEFORE THEY FAIL WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE IT IS IT IS REACTIONARY TO THIS THIS CRISIS AND THIS CHALLENGE. AS OPPOSED TO MAKING ACCORDING FOR THE INVESTMENTS WE NEED. SO WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE FUND THAT'S THE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE. PROVIDED THE STATE BOARD TO HELP START TO CLOSE THIS GAP TO SPEND IT ON OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE. TO HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND I THINK I. MAY HAVE MADE THIS POINT- BEFORE IT IS JUST THAT WE- YOU HAVE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. USUALLY BEST SERVE THOSE LARGER SYSTEMS AND IT'S THE SMALLER SYSTEMS THAT NEED MORE THESE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DOLLARS. EVEN GOT A PROJECT TO CONSTRUCTION THEY GOT A TO A POINT WHERE THEY CAN RECEIVE YOU KNOW PART OF THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION THAT WE JUST RECENTLY. RECEIVED THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO INVESTING CAPITAL SO. I FEEL WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY HERE TRULY IS A GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. TO REVERSE WHAT IS THIS TREND OF SMALL FAILING SYSTEMS. AND INSTEAD ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES I HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE WATER HERE INTO THE FUTURE AND UNDERSTAND. IT IT'S ALMOST A DIFFERENT SERVICE MODEL IT'S A DIFFERENT PROGRAM ALL TOGETHER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR FOR SMALLER. SYSTEMS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GO TO. THE USUAL YOU KNOW PROGRAMS LIKE THE STATE REVOLVING FUND OR. IS OTHER PROGRAMS THAT- THE FEDERAL. HASN'T REALLY KEPT UP IN THE- ON IN AS MANY THAT. SYSTEMS COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND IN THE STATE HAVE BEGUN TO FALL TO THE CRACKS AND THAT'S WHERE. WE CAN JUST SO PROUD OF THE WORK THE STATE HAS DONE. WITH THE SECOND AFFORDABLE FUN WITH THE SAFER PROGRAM. TO BE ABLE TO REALLY REVERSES KIND. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU YOU HAVE A VISION FOR HOW THE STATE CAN BEGIN TO BALANCE- THE NEEDS AND THE CHALLENGES. OF THE HAVE NOTS- VERSUS THE HABS. AND SOMETIMES HOW YOU DEFINE HAES AND HAVE NOTS MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE REALLY. FAIR AND JUST WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS. AS IT RELATES TO WATER WHICH IS INCREDIBLY- CRITICAL. RESOURCE YOU KNOW I ALWAYS WONDER LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU KNOW ARMAGEDDON HITS ARE WE GOING TO pWATER WORLD AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS MAD MAX WHICH IS. INCREDIBLY SCARY- THERE'S ALWAYS THIS TENSION BETWEEN. WATER RELIABILITY AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK ABOUT IN LOS ANGELES. I KNOW IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS THOUGHT ABOUT- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AS WELL- AND IN NORTHERN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW THAT THE BOARD HAS UNDERTAKEN. YOU KNOW MANY ACTIONS TO PROTECT FISHERIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FISHERIES IN LOS ANGELES SO I AM. INSTEAD OF HONING FOR A FRIEND I'M ASKING FOR A FRIEND- AND IMPROVED CONDITIONS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE RESTORATION ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT GOALS- I KNOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE EXPECT TO SEE. EVEN MORE FREQUENT AND LONGER LASTING DRAFTS I FEEL LIKE WE SORT OF ONCE WE AND ONE WERE IN ANOTHER ONE. AND SO WANTED TO KNOW AND- IF YOU SUPPORT VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS- AS A WAY TO BALANCE THE NEEDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY. YES YEAH I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENORMITY OF THE WORK AND TASK THAT WE ALL HAVE IN OUR WATERSHEDS IF YOU. TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES CAN CAN THRIVE INTO THE FUTURE HERE KNOWING- THE CHALLENGES AT WORK WE'RE HEARING TRACING. IT REQUIRES LOCALS WITH LOCAL LEADERSHIP AND EXPERTISE TO OWN THIS CHALLENGE AND COME TO THE STATE WITH WITH. WITH WORK WITH AGREEMENT ON ON HOW BEST TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS KNOW THAT YOU KNOW VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING TO AIM TOWARD. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO SET THE BAR TO WHICH AGREEMENTS MEET AND THEN WE CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT YES THIS VOLUNTARY EFFORT IS PROTECTED. ISN'T HIS ENSURING THIS COMMON OUTCOME THAT WE ARE ALL DESIRING. I FEEL SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST SOMETIMES A FALSE DICHOTOMY THAT'S THAT'S PLACED BEFORE WHAT'S REGULATORY WORKING WITH A VOLUNTARY ACTION AND I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY A CONTINUAL. EFFORT BETWEEN THE TWO AND ALL TOGETHER IT'S ABOUT THE OUTCOMES IT'S ABOUT THE COMMON OUTCOMES THAT I THINK WE ALL SEE AND WANT FOR A COMMUNITIES. WHICH IS ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER WHICH IS CONTINUED ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND VIABILITY AND TO PROVIDE. A COMMON A GOOD FOR US ALL AND NOT ALLOW JUST YOU KNOW. THE NEEDS AND DESIRES OF A FEW TO- TO TAKE UP MOST OF THE DECISION MAKING STATES. AND SO- SO I AM VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF ALL INTERIOR PAYMENTS ARE OUR BOARD HAS BEEN CONSISTENT ABOUT THEM AND THEY'RE USUALLY DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR UPDATE OF THE WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN UPDATE- BUT IT IT INCLUDES VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND- WATER RATES CURTAILMENT. JUST YESTERDAY AND DAY BEFORE WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSION- IN- AND OUR RETIREMENTS FOR THIS TIME SHASTA RIVER AND LEAVING OPEN. THE ABILITY FOR VOLUNTEER AGREEMENT IT'S TO COME TO AT THE LOW LEVEL. BUT IMPORTANTLY IT'S ALL ON ON COM OUTCOMES. AND MEASURABLE COMMON THAT DON'T HAVE AMONGST THE OTHER. THANK YOU FOR THE- YOU KNOW I THAT. AS I HAVE TAKEN A COUPLE OF WATER TOWARDS MYSELF IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE THE QUESTIONS ARE. DO YOU PROVIDE WATER OR DO YOU PROTECT THE FTSE THE SMELT YOU KNOW- AND I WONDER HOW DO WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN SAY YES TO BOTH- AND JUST KIND OF WANTED TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO. AID BOTH- WHICH IS PROBABLY EXPANDING ON THE FIRST QUESTION I ASK BUT YOU KNOW EIGHT CONTINUING TO DO THINGS THAT WILL PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT WHILE ALSO HELPING FOLKS UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER RELIABILITY- AND THE CRITICAL ILLNESS OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE ON TO EVERYONE ACROSS THE STATE- DO YOU DID I MEAN DO YOU FEEL THAT TENSION- DO YOU FEEL LIKE THEIR PATHWAYS THROUGH THIS. I DEFINITELY FEEL THAT TENSION- AND YOU KNOW I DO FEEL THERE ARE PATHWAYS THROUGH IT BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ROSS US ALL TO BE JUST BE. VERY HONEST WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING. AND TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT WERE RECONCILING A SYSTEM THAT WE'VE ALL INHERITED. WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR IN NINETEEN CENTURY LAWS TWENTIETH CENTURY INFRASTRUCTURE IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CHALLENGES. AND THE REALITY IS THAT WE BUILT OUT SO MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE. FOR A CLIMATE THAT NO LONGER EXISTS SIMPLY NO LONGER EXISTS. AND RECONCILING THAT FACT RECONCILING THESE INVESTMENTS AND ENSURING THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE NOW CAN START TO. MOVE TOWARD THE REALITY OF. A CALIFORNIA WITH THE REDUCED IMPACT. INCREASING AND LONGER DROUGHTS FLASH FLOODS RISING SEA NEEDS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY THINK OCT HERE AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING NOW ARE SENDING US ON A PATH FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. AND THAT WE NEED TO ACT JUST BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES WITH THE ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. AND I FEEL NOW I'LL JUST SAY CANDIDLY THAT OFTENTIMES SOME ARE STILL CLINGING TO THE STATUS QUO. THAT AGAIN REGRETTABLY IS NO LONGER HERE. OUR CLIMATE HAS CHANGED OUR WATER SYSTEMS WERE BUILT FOR A DIFFERENT CENTURY IN A DIFFERENT TIME AND WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEE A REAL GENERATIONAL. SHIFT IN OUR THINKING LET ALONE A GENERATIONAL REINVESTMENT. IN THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. AMEN BROTHER- YOU KNOW I'LL QUESTION WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE MET BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS WITH THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE BUT WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU BEING CHAIR- AND LEADERSHIP AS CHAIR AND PART OF THE ROLE AS A CHAIR IS ALSO TO INSPIRE AND EMPOWER STAFF AND THE WORK THAT YOU ALL YOU ARE- OF FACILITATING AND LEADING INTERNALLY AROUND REAL DISCUSSIONS- WITH A VERY DIVERSE STAFF- WITH THE REALITY THAT WATER IS A HUMAN RIGHT- ANNA KNOWLEDGE IN SOME OF THE YOU KNOW EMAIL REPLY ALL. GAUGE THAT WAS GOING ON- AT THE BOARD SO JUST WANTED TO LET YOU- TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WORK THAT YOU ARE HELPING TO LEAD INTERNALLY WITH YOUR STAFF- AROUND THIS KIND OF WATER JUSTICE AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL VOICES ARE SEEN AND HEARD AN ELEVATED IN THIS DISCUSSION AROUND- WATER RIGHTS JUSTICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP BUT LOOK AROUND CERTAINLY AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS YOU KNOW WE'RE FEELING IT- IT'S HERE BUT SO ARE THE RACIAL INEQUALITY SAID THAT WE SEE AND WE CAN WE- NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE. AND BY SENIOR TECHNOLOGY AND TRY TO TRY TO. UNDERSTAND AND AN ADDRESS. YOU KNOW HI IT I'LL JUST SAY THAT. RACE ISN'T AN EASY THING TO TALK ABOUT RACIAL INEQUALITIES AND INEQUITY IS NOT A SIMPLE DISCUSSION FOR ANYONE FOR MYSELF- I KNOW I CARRY MY OWN BIAS SEES LIFE I AM. I AM PROUD OF MYSELF IN PERFECT BUT ALSO THAT AS GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS IT'S NOT AN EASY THING CUT UNDERTAKEN DISCUSSION AROUND RACIAL INEQUALITY. BUT I THINK THAT NOT UNLIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE OBVIOUSNESS OF THE LANDS FROM WHICH IMPACTS ALL OF OUR WORK AND THEN THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT CUT. TO FIGURE IT OUT TO THEN NAVIGATE AND MANAGE THROUGH IT SO TOO I FEEL ARE THE CHALLENGES OF THE RACIAL INEQUITIES AND INEQUALITIES THAT WE FIND OURSELVES WITH. AND SO THE BOARD HAS UNDERTAKEN- RACIAL EQUITY- INITIATIVE AND PART OF THAT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RESOLUTION- AND IMPORTANTLY IT'S TAKEN US A YEAR TO ACTUALLY DRAFT IT AND BECAUSE WE'VE NEEDED TO OURSELVES HAVE CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT THE ISSUE AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE INTO IT INTO ALSO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- SOME MAY NOT SEE IT EMISSIONS SOME HAVE HAVE SAID THAT BY. RACE OR RACIAL INEQUALITY. IF IT IS ITSELF CREATING- WHICH IS INTERESTING. BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE WHAT WE CAN DO- IS TO HAVE A DISCUSSION BE MINDFUL THAT RACIAL INEQUITY INEQUALITY IS. SUCH A HUGE IMPACT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER ACCESS TO SANITATION. AND THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THAT IN ORDER TO NOT PERPETUATE. THE INEQUALITIES THAT WE SEE AND HOPEFULLY HELP CONTRIBUTE TO. THE EQUITY TO THE SORTS OF COMMUNITIES THAT THAT WE WANT TO SEE I THINK. IT'S NOT LOST ON ME I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT YOU LOOK BACK FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE BOARD ITSELF WAS WAS WAS CREATED UNDER QUARTER CULLEN. YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAN WATER ACT YOU LOOK AT THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT. THOSE WERE ALSO AND THE DANGER SPECIES ACT THESE YOU KNOW THESE THESE REALLY BIG ARE. INCREDIBLE THIS IS A LEGISLATION THAT REALLY SHIFTED THE WAY THAT WE SEE AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR CHALLENGES. BUT THOSE TWO WERE WERE HAPPENING AT TEN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. IMPORTANTLY WHAT IS WITH OUR DISCUSSION AND THAT RACIAL AND INEQUALITY SEGREGATION SO MUCH OF. THE THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE WERE LEFT IN THE PAST ARE STILL A CHALLENGE NOT UNLIKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES WE SEE TODAY. SO I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO. AS AS ALL GENERATIONS DUE TO RECOMMIT OURSELVES. TO WHAT WAS THEN A REVOLUTION AROUND THE WAY WE'VE BUTTE AND STARK COMMUNITIES ABOUT I WAS THE BENEFICIARY OF. BEING BORN IN EIGHTY TWO BEING A MILLENNIAL HERE I PROMISE I THOUGHT I TOO WAS PART OF ALREADY A SOCIETY THAT. WAS QUOTE UNQUOTE WAISTLINE OR THAT SOMEHOW REYES WASN'T DETERMINATIVE OUTCOMES. BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL CLEARLY HERE AND CLEAR EYED UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. AND THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT BOTTOM LIKE. CLIMATE CHANGE IN IN IN THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CHALLENGE. THAT IT IS BUT ALSO IN RECOGNIZE ZING AT THAT APPROVING. SO MUCH OUR WORK IT CAN BE. TO EVEN CAN DOWN. AND WHY WE NEED TO BE SPECIFIC AND INTENTIONAL WITH OUR WORK AND SO I'M CREDIT WE PROUD OF OUR- OUR OUR AGENCY IN THE WORK THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING. APPARENTLY THE WATER SECTOR WRIT LARGE WHICH IS COMMON IN MANY WAYS EMBRACE THIS EFFORT AS WELL AND I THANK. MANY OF THE LEADERS OUT THERE TO BUT THE COURAGE AND- THE BRAVERY TO TACKLE A NOT EASY DISCUSSION. BUT SUCH A CRITICAL ONE FOR NOT GOING TO PERPETUATE AND HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT. HAVE THESE GREAT INEQUITIES INCLUDING THE ONE THAT I MYSELF GREW UP IN THE EASTERN PROTONMAIL. THANK YOU- SO I. I APPRECIATE YOUR BACKGROUND- YOUR PHYSICAL BACKGROUND BECAUSE I LIKE LOOKING AT THOSE IMAGES. I APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY- BECAUSE- YOU CAN TELL WHEN SOMEONE IS REALLY TELLING YOU THE TRUTH- ABOUT THEIR PLANS AND WHAT THEY SEE AND THEIR VISION.

THANK YOU SENATOR- WELL I WOULD TO ADD ON. TO THE CONVERSATION I APPRECIATE THE- QUESTIONS AND TOPICS AT ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BROUGHT UP HERE TODAY- IF YOU LOOK AROUND YOU SEE WE REPRESENT- ALL OF US. VERY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES I THINK THE VICE CHAIR AND I HAVE MORE OF A SIMILAR. STORY B. AND FROM A PART OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NOT LOS ANGELES- AS IT RELATES TO ISSUES OF- OF DESALINATION. YEAH THE PURE WATER A PROJECT THAT WE HAVE IN SAN DIEGO THAT WERE GONNA CELEBRATE AND INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES. TOWARDS ON FRIDAY OF THIS WEEK- BUT IT'S REALLY INTERESTING- YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE POLITICS OF WATER HAS LESS TO DO WITH OUR- POLITICAL PARTY AND MORE TO DO WITH THE GEOGRAPHY AND THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE- FORMER SECRETARY SORRY OF. NATURAL RESOURCES THIS IS A LED TO A VERY SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION AND SINCE YOUR RETURN TO CALIFORNIA FROM THE FROM A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION I THINK WE HAVE BENEFITTED A NUMBER OF US HAVE SAID ON THIS- RULES COMMITTEE AND- CONFIRM TO MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAD. MANY DISCUSSIONS SO HI YOU SHARE MY COLLEAGUES- INCREDIBLE- COMPLIMENTS TO YOU IN TERMS OF YOUR NOT YOUR- ARM THE- THAT WE HAVE IN YOU. SO ALL OF THE COMMENTS QUESTIONS BEEN ASKED AYE AYE YET AGAIN I FIND WITH ONCE A- QUESTION I YOU KNOW WE DO. A DE S. B. TWO- FROM OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR MINING. ON THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM- AND OF COURSE SAYS- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS A COMMUNITY THAT BENEFITED FROM THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM PHOTO SO MY COLLEAGUE FROM. BAKERSFIELD AND KERN COUNTY MADE A COMMENT ABOUT NEEDLES CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA OF SOME O THE COMMUNITIES THUS FAR THAT PROGRAM HAS- HAS HELPED SO FAR- KIND OF WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED IN AND- IT DID IT DID THEY NOT HAVE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER BEFORE AND HAVE IT NOW I MEAN JUST GIVE ME A PICTURE. OF THAT IF YOU WOULD. THANK YOU. SENATOR THE WORK OF THE DAY AT THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER AND SAFER AS FANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROJECTS UP AND DOWN- THE STATE AND BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONCENTRATED ONES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- WHERE. WE SEE A NUMBER OF AT PARTICULARLY RULE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND CHALLENGES WITH DRINKING WATER- YOU KNOW I'M I'M GLAD AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED ONE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX AND TRUMP. SOLUTIONS SINCE THE PROGRAM FIRST STARTED HERE AND THAT INCLUDES ALSO THAN ANOTHER HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT- PLANNING ASSISTANCE GRANTS AND THAT'S TOUCHING OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE- WE'VE CONSOLIDATED OF I OR WILL HAVE COMPLETED FORTY SEVEN CONSOLIDATIONS HERE AND THAT TIME AS WELL- AND SO- YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY. YOU KNOW WHAT COMES TO MIND OUR OUR COMMUNITIES LIKE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY. WHO HAVE CONSOLIDATION PROJECTS IN PLACE TO EXTEND SERVICE TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- AT MOBILE HOME PARKS THERE AND THEN SIMILARLY IN LAKE COUNTY THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CONSOLIDATIONS AND SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT. YOU TRULY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE LONG TERM FOR THE SMALLER SYSTEMS A CONSOLIDATION. AND IS ONE OF OUR OUR STRONGER TOOLS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THEM TO CONNECT TO A MORE STABLE LONGER TERM SYSTEM AND ALLOW FOR THE REPAIR BASE THAT WE WILL BE KNOWS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN SYSTEMS. INTO THE FUTURE AND SO WE'RE LOOKING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ACCELERATING THOSE. HERE IN THE TIME AHEAD AS WELL. THANK YOU AND THE LAST COMMENT I WOULD MAKE TWO OF TO A POINT I THINK THE VICE CHAIR. STARTED TO TALK ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT. TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX OF WHICH DESALINATION IS ONE AN OBVIOUSLY WORKING THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AROUND- MAKING IT A BETTER JOB. TYPE OF ODD TOOL- ENVIRONMENTALLY. IN THIS THE. PARTNER AGENCIES THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK WHEN THEY'RE- THAT HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE COASTAL. THOUGH WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD AND I'M NOT SURE WHO ELSE- IS THAT PROCESS GETTING SMOOTHER ARE YOU GIVE ME JUST A COUPLE OF SENTENCES ON. HOW YOU SEE THAT PER YOU KNOW PROCEEDING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I'VE HEARD OBVIOUSLY WE'LL HEAR THE STORIES WERE THEY DON'T. GO SO SMOOTHLY BUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. YEAH I THINK WE I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR I HAVE TO SAY I THINK WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT BACKWARD NATION UP- MET SOME MONTHS PROJECTS- PROJECTS IN SOMETIMES GET LOST IN THAT PERMIT SHUFFLE IT IS NOT AN EASY PROCESS- AND I KNOW MY MIND GOES TO. THINGS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE DASHBOARDS THAT I KNOW WERE DEVELOPED ON THE FEDERAL SIDE WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IN ORDER TO ON THEIR SIDE AND BETTER COORDINATE THAT PERMITTING ACTIVITY AMONGST NUMEROUS STATE AGENCIES. SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE IMPROVE THOSE- AND YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THESE OTHER JUST SUCH COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT YEAH THE END UP. AT IT HAVING TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND BETTER COORDINATING- THOSE PERMITS AMONGST US I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REALLY I THINK ABOUT IN ORDER TO HELP MAKE SURE THE PROJECTS ARE BEING DELIVERED YES WHILE BEING PROTECTIVE. BUT WHILE ALSO. HAVING SOME SOME BETTER PROCESS AROUND. THANK YOU HI I WISH YOU LUCK IN THAT BECAUSE- HERE IN YEAH I MEAN IT IS NEVER EASY TO MAKE IT THROUGH. ANY PRIVATE YOU KNOW PROCESS AND THOSE PROCESSES ARE THERE FOR A REASON. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU'RE HAVING TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND ONE AGENCY GIVES YOU THE GREEN LIGHT AND ANOTHER ONE ABSOLUTELY STOPS THE PROJECT. WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM. AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT OU OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME DEGREE OF PATIENTS FOR- FOR GOING HROUGH THAT PROCESS I HOPE I HOPE YOU COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THAT- I DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS I'D I JUST. TRULY APPRECIATE I AM MORE QUESTIONS I TRULY APPRECIATE- YOUR EXPERTISE I FEEL LIKE WE ARE SO FORTUNATE I IN CALIFORNIA. TO HAVE DATA.

YOU'RE WELCOME- AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS JUST FOR- MISTER YOU GIVEN THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE- IN YOUR PRIOR LIFE AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND GOING UNDER COVER I'M AND I THINK DISCUSSIONS THAT- YOU HAD AROUND- WANTING THE COMMISSION TO HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS. JUST WANTED YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT ACTIONS USING THE COMMISSION CAN TAKE ON ITS OWN TIME TO GIVE YOURSELF MORE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW YOU APPROVE AND DENY- APPLICATIONS AND POSSIBLY HOW YOU CAN WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- BASICALLY WHEN I WAS REFERRING TO DISCRETION HI SITTING ON THE COMMISSION ALAS. SB FIVE MONTHS NOW I ATTENDED- NUMEROUS POTENTIALLY HEARINGS AS WELL AS COMMISSION MEETINGS LICENSING AND- A LOT OF- THE AFRICANS ARE COMING IN- YOU KNOW THEY ARE AFRAID OF YOU KNOW. COMING IN AND ASKING QUESTIONS AND A LOT OF TIMES A BASICALLY ARE UNTRUTHFUL OR THE AGES ARE AFRAID TO BASICALLY TELL US EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON BACKGROUND. WHEN I WAS REFERRING TO HAVING MORE DISCRETION I GUESS WHAT I WAS MEANING WAS THAT- IN THE END- A LOT OF. BARCLAYS THAT THE STATE. PUT IN PLACE. MANY YEARS AGO- I HAVE NO FLEXIBILITY FOR MANDATORY DISCRETION- I WANTED TO BASICALLY STATE THAT. IT WILL BE THAT THE COMMISSION HAVE MORE DISCRETION TO AN AREA MANAGER DISCRETION SO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING THAT COMES IN. AND COMMITTED A MARCH FOR TO WITHIN TEN YEARS- AND DOES PERSONALIZED AND WITHIN TEN YEARS BECAUSE HE S. CONVICTION. NOW IT IS MANDATORY TO NOT- SO IF WE HAVE A MORE DISCRETION THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT PERSON IT IS SOMETHING HE CAN YEARS AGO TWENTY YEARS AGO. IS A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON FROM THAT'S COMING IN NOW. WE WOULD JUST LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE DISCRETION SO THAT BASED ON WHAT THIS PERSON COMING IN NOW TELLING US AND HOW THEY ARE PRODUCTIVE. MARY AND WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY FOR FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS WE JUST WANNA BE ABLE TO. ATHOLL DISCRETION THAT WE CAN SIT DOWN THE STATE LEGISLATURES TO MAKE AMENDMENTS SO THAT WE JUST HAVE MORE DISCRETION WHEN IT COMES TO AREA WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE MANDATORY DID NOT. BECAUSE MAKE A MANDATORY DENIAL OR SOMEBODY CAN AFFECT THEIR LIVES- PAYER MEDICAL BENEFITS THERE ARE YOU KNOW MAKING MORTGAGE PAYMENT HOUSE WE JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO BE FAIR TRANSPARENT. SO THAT WE GET% EVERYBODY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT SO THAT THEY CAN GET EITHER. PROVE OR DENY OUR BASED ON THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT PERSON NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO CONVEY. FOR MORE DISCRETION IN. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THE I JUST I WANT TO SAY THAT I ALL YOU ALL- IMMENSELY BECAUSE- AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS- AMONGST YOU ALL- AND LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO CONFIRM YOU. I JUST ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT- YOU KNOW THE FIRST IN ARENA SPORTS BOOK OPENED I THINK IN WASHINGTON DC IN MAY. AND OTHERS ARE COMING ONLINE IN OTHER STATES AND JUST HOPING THAT YOU ALL WILL USE THIS- THIS BOARD. TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN HOW TO BE HELPFUL- AS THIS INDUSTRY EVOLVES OUT TO KEEP CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE- ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO GAMING- BECAUSE- I THINK WE DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND IT'S AN INCREDIBLY- RICH- INDUSTRY WITH A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES. FOR REVENUE AND GROWTH AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COMPETITIVE AS A STATE. SO- THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND LOOK FORWARD TO IT CONFIRMING YOU AT THE RIGHT TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- THANK YOU SENATOR COME LONGER UP MINUTE VICE CHAIR I THINK I'M GONNA. MIX IT UP A BIT AND- ASK YOU TO GO NEXT- THANK THANK YOU. FOR YOUR SERVICE AND WELCOME ABOARD ALL YOU NEW MEMBER SAW YOU HAD A FEW MONTHS TO GET ACCLIMATED. TO YOU WHAT IS A VERY VERY OFTEN FONG PRECONCEIVED. OUR RESPONSIBILITY ALL THAT YOU HAVE FOR YOU KNOW THE MANY ON GAMBLING OPERATIONS THAT ARE. LIKE HEREIN OUR STATE AND CERTAINLY OUR POTENTIAL OF ONE BEING ADDED SO I THINK THAT QUESTION REGARDING ENOUGH PORTS VETTING. A WITH WITH WITH A GOOD ANSWER KATHLEEN GOOD. THANK YOU. MY POWER. I DO IF I DO. COME ACROSS SOMETHING IN HER YOU COULD OR WANT TO WEIGH IN THIS THE TRYING NAY GRAHAM FROM. OUR CURRENT BALANCE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION THAT I RECEIVED. AND IT STRUCK ME AS I WAS LOOKING AT THAT THAT THAT IS THE ACCESS OVER THE ONE MILLION THAT GOES TO THE SMALLER OF DAHLE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE MACHINES OF THE TRIBES WITH WITH LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF. GAMBLING I GUESS MACHINES ARE AND WHEN THOSE ARE MADE OUT AND THEN WHATEVER'S LEFT GOES INTO THIS TRIBAL NATION GRANTING GRANT FUNDED I'M- SAYING THIS TO YOU BUT ALSO REMINDING MYSELF OF HOW THE UP. WITH THE WATERFALL IS. BUT WHEN I WAS LEADER I WAS- HELLO A NUMBER OF THE- SMALLER I TRIBES VISITED ME AND SPOKE ABOUT. THE SITUATIONS THEY WERE FACING WHERE FATHER EDUCATION IN HIM THERE TRY ON THEIR- LANDS OF THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED TO ENSURE. THAT THEY HAVE THE FACILITIES FOR EDUCATION. THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED TO PROVIDE HOUSING. BIG ISSUE WAS HOUSING ON A COUPLE OF THE NORTHERN TRIBES IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. HE STRUCK ME OF SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM. AND WITH THIS KIND OF OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCE THAT'S AVAILABLE. ARE SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO. GRANT SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE PARTICULAR TRIBES THAT ARE STILL STRUGGLING AND ESPECIALLY AFTER THE PANDEMIC PROBABLY EVEN MORE SO. FELLOW I JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHEN GRANTS ARE GIVEN. DO WE A FAST THAT KIND OF NEED AND DO WE FOLLOW UP. TO MAKE SURE THAT MONEY THAT FOR APPROPRIATED. THROUGH THAT GRANT PROGRAM AND- TO. THOSE WHO APPLY- IS GOING INTO THE KIND OF NEEDS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED CERTAINLY TO ME AND I'M SURE THERE ARE. MANY OTHERS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE MADE OUT. YEAH IN A SHORTER TIME FRAME AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THERE MIGHT BE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY THERE AND THERE COULD BE PRIVATE- PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS AND IN THE SAME SENSE OF. THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS SO- I'M GOING TO ASK ALL OF YOU TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT THAT AND GIVE ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY. HEART WRENCHING WHEN I HEARD ABOUT FROM OF THE SITUATIONS THAT WERE. MANY FAMILIES LIVING ON AND NO ONE SPECIFIC BUT. FAMILY BOTH HOME AROUND UNTIL THAT KIND OF COMES. WITH WILL OF WATER. WILL ENERGY- AIR CONDITIONING WHAT ALL THE THAT WE ENJOY AND CERTAINLY A LOT MORE ON AFFLUENT. TRIBAL NATIONS OR TRIBES PROBABLY ARE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THEIR PEOPLE HAVING VISITED A NUMBER OF BILLS. OVER THE COURSE OF MY SERVICE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE SO HAVE AT IT NICE AND TELL ME WHAT WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT. AND HOW WE MIGHT ENSURE. THAT THOSE NEEDS ARE MET THROUGH THIS GRANT PROGRAM. LET ME ASK OUR CHAIR OF THE BRIEF YOU WANNA KICK US OFF ON THAT ONE. OKAY I'LL DO THAT THANK YOU- YES IT'S UNFORTUNATE- WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THE GALLAGHER TRUMP MISSION DOESN'T HAVE- A SAY SO IN HOW THAT MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED. ALSO WE DON'T HAVE A RULE THEY ARE WE ARE WE JUST WEIRD AND MINISTRY- THE FUNDS THAT COME THROUGH THAT- BUT WE DON'T GET TO DECIDE WHAT THEY'RE SPENT ON. SO THAT SAID THERE ARE OTHER FUNDS THAT TIME THERE'S SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND- IS A PIECE OF IT AND THAT COMES FROM. I SHOULD MENTION THE TRIBES AND THEY TALK ABOUT OTHER CRIMES BETTER ON CAN'T HAVE CASINOS OR HAVE ISSUES WITH- FEWER THAN I THINK MAYBE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THREE FIFTY- SLOTS- THERE IS THE ONLY CONTROL FIND- AND THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND- SO WE- BASICALLY. WE'RE FUNDED THROUGH THE GALA CONTROL FUN AND THAT'S TO THE OF FEES ANNUAL FEES THAT ARE PAID OUT- AND THEN WE ALSO DRAW FROM THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND. FOR THE TASK THAT WE DID FOR THE TRIBES UNDER THE COMPACTS WE ARE DESIGNATED TO DO CERTAIN THINGS UP FOR THEM BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE EXTENT OF OUR- INVOLVEMENT WITH RESPECT TO- TO IT PLEASE WE DON'T HAVE. A SAY SO ON HOW THE MONEY GOES SO THAT IS A SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND IS SET OUT BY THE CONTACTS AND ALL THAT SUPPOSED TO GO AND THEN. WITH THE BRITISH SHARING TRUST FUND WE DON'T HAVE A HOME. YEAH BUT WE DON'T HAVE A ROLE THERE. WELL I KNOW. HOW TO DISTRIBUTE IT YEAH.ALL IT CAN ACT. YES GO AHEAD OUR COMMISSIONER. THANK YOU- I READ THAT IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SO OR EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM GRAY LEGISLATION THAT SIGNED INTO LAW THAT PRESCRIBES WHAT THE COMMISSION'S WALL WOULD BE IN ADMINISTERING THE FARM AND LAID OUT HOW THE MONEY WAS TO BE DISTRIBUTED I DON'T RECALL ALL OF THE DETAILS OF THAT- BUT YOU'VE PIQUED MY INTEREST SENATOR BATES AND I WILL BE LOOKING BACK AT THAT LEGISLATION AND ALSO ENQUIRING ABOUT WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN. ANY KIND OF REPORTS THAT- SINCE THE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD THINK ALSO THAT IF THERE IS A NEED TO. MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THAT THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE AT A FUTURE TIME. IT WOULD THAT WAS GONNA BE MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS THERE LEGISLATION. THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO ASSIST YOU ALL AND PERHAPS HAVING A LITTLE MORE OVERSIGHT THERE I UNDERSTAND A PANEL DECIDES AND I'M SURE THAT THAT FOR POINTED BY. ALL THE TRIBES SITE- TOGETHER ON- REVIEWING THOSE REQUEST FOR THOSE APPLICATIONS FOR GRANTS BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT THING TO TAKE A LOOK AT- AT THIS POINT IN. THAT ARE YOU KNOW LAST TWO YEARS THE CHALLENGING- TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT OFF BUT I'M SURE. OF WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LOW INCOME AND YOU KNOW AND- ALL THE THINGS THAT. OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE FACED DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT ONE THAT WITH A PROBLEM BEFORE. WE GOT INTO THE PHIRI OF REDUCTION AND NOW FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MEET THESE KINDS OF NEEDS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I AND- I GUESS THE LAST QUESTION AND MAYBE. I'LL DROPPING OUT TO. FIFTH MISTER. FINE HOW THAT HAD A QUESTION. WE DON'T WANT TO YOU OUT SO OFTEN. WE SEE MAY PEOPLE RETURNING TO ALL OF THESE FUN ACTIVITIES OUT THOROUGHLY GAMBLING BEING- IMPORTANT WHEN I TELL YOU THAT WAS- THAT CAN'T MY MOM GOING FOR THE LAST I THINK FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF HER LIFE. EVEN THOUGH SHE SUFFERED LINE OF THOUGHT THE TIME SHE COULD STILL TELL WHEN SHE HEARD A SLOT MACHINE WHAT THE WEATHER BY YOU KNOW WINNING OR LOSING. THAT- WE HAVE THE DELTA VARIANT BACKING BACK AN ARMY AND STAND UP. HOW ARE WE ARE YOU KNOW OVERSEEING WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON ON ON THE FRENCH WITH- THE PROTOCOLS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. TO ENSURE THAT CHILD ABUSE ESTABLISHMENTS CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND CERTAINLY DO IT WITH THE LEAST. RESTART THREAT TO THE SPREAD OF SPREADER SEND HIM THE- THING IS THAT I'M NOT SURE YOU HAVE ANY ROLL OVER THAT BUT CERTAINLY YOU HAVE. FIRM KNOWLEDGE AND PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE OVERSIGHT. IN TERMS OF THE ENSURING THAT BOTH PROTOCOLS WHICH ARE. ARE CERTAINLY NATIONAL UNIVERSALIST POINT TIME- THAT THEY WERE BEING EMPLOYED AND YOU KNOW OUR- YEAH. OF STEP. BEING NOTES ON TRIBAL LANDS OR OTHERWISE. SURE AND I WOULD BENEFICIAL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY- I MEAN YOU SERVE ON THE COMMISSION WHILE INSIDE I MEAN DURING COLD TIME AND SO MOST OF THE DAY THE- YOUR NATION SOME PROCEDURES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE- WE'RE DONE BEFORE MY TIME AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT- THE COMMISSION. AND THE COMMISSION STAFF HAS DONE A REALLY. GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO ENSURE THAT. ALL THE WORKERS AND THE PARTICIPANTS IN THAT THE ESTABLISHMENTS ARE SAFE AND HEALTHY OF COURSE- THIS IS VERY MUCH AN UNPRECEDENTED- TERRITORY I THINK OR AND- AND OPEN. AND I THINK BOTH THE INDUSTRY AND PARTICIPANTS AND EMPLOYEES ARE- YOU KNOW JUST RECOVERING FROM THE DRIVE FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE SHUTDOWNS AND PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS AND- AND- ALL OF AND THAT'S PARTICIPATING. UNIT THAT COMES AS PART OF THAT- I THINK AS WE RE OPEN AND NOW WE HAVE THE NEW DELTA VERY COMING UP. AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW YET HOW THAT'S GOING TO- AFFECT BUSINESSES AND AN EFFECT BECAUSE FRESH BECAUSE THE- REALLY DEPENDS A LOT ON VACCINATION RATES. AND HOW THAT AFFECTS AND AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN AND SCIENCE CONTINUES TWELVE ALL. AROUND- ACTIONS AND I THINK THAT WILL NEED TO RE REACHED AND CAN. TO TALK ABOUT THAT- ALL THE PROCEDURES ARE STILL IN PLACE. AS FAR AS I KNOW AROUND AROUND COVE IN- THE ENFORCEMENT IS NOT. OF THOSE ARTICLES ARE REALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BUREAU AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN THE BUREAU AND THE LICENSING SIDE- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS ARE IN PLACE. AND THEY CONTINUE TO- NUMBER ONE OF COURSE KEEP EVERYBODY SAFE AND HEALTHY AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE. PRIORITY BUT ALSO THAT THEY CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEEDS THAT WE NEED THEM TO DO AND THAT THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT THE THAT THESE- CAN CONTINUE WHEN PEOPLE CAN GO BACK TO WORK AND- AND GET THEIR LIVES BACK IN ORDER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS ALL OF YOU AND YOU ALL SEEM VERY. QUALIFIED FILL UP THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE FANNED OUT. HAVE A GOOD TIME YOU'VE GOT TO BE A GOOD TIME YOU GUYS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THAT SO. HOPEFULLY WITH THIS YEAR. THANKS THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR- SENATOR GROWTH. IN DEMAND FOR TEN AND- THE COMMISSIONER HE I HAVE TO TELL YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND THE FIRST FEMALE VETERAN IT'S EVER SERVED IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE AND NOW WE SHARE THE SAME RANK DIFFERENCE- DIFFERENT AT. I CERTAINLY I SEATS ARMY RENDERING CARPET SAME RANK SPECIALTY FOR SO. AND THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU. M. GALA G. GOOD TO SEE YOU. YES SENATOR THANK YOU I'M EXCITED ABOUT AND THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENTS TO THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE I BELIEVE EVERYBODY IS WELL ROUNDED GIVE IT A BRILLIANT ATTORNEY OBVIOUSLY BASED ON THE BACKGROUND THAT I READ- YOU KNOW YOU HAVELAW ENFORCEMENT AND SOMEBODY'S DONE INVESTIGATION WORK AND- OF COURSE GALGIANI CERTAIN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE AND- WE KNOW THAT SHE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE WILLING TO WORK WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO MAKE SURE THAT. I'M GOOD POLICY AND STAMPEDERS TO ADMINISTER- I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT YOU- MISTER HINES SORRY. AND BASED ON WHAT I READ ON YOUR BACKGROUND. AS SO. BEING A NEW MEMBER I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN SERVING FOR US SINCE JANUARY BELIEVE THAT. WHEN THE SITUATION RIGHT YES. SINCE THE END OF JANUARY WHAT ARE YOU DOING. YOU KNOW I KNOW THE GAMING INDUSTRY'S IN CAT AND INCREDIBLY NUANCED- LOTS OF DIFFERENT REGULATORY ASPECTS- AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO LEARN ABOUT THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY TO HELP YOU. ON IT INFORM YOUR DECISION MAKING IN THE PROCESS. SURE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR- I THINK FIRST OF ALL IT'S- LEARNING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY ITSELF AND AS YOU SAID IS VERY NUANCED AND OUR WATER VERY. COMPETING INTERESTS AS WELL AS AS NEW ONES INTERESTS ARE- I DID AND I AND I WENT VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE. ABOUT HOW IT ALL WORKS. AND HE SAID I THINK THERE ARE SOME UNIVERSAL ASPECTS ACT THAT JUST THE FACT. THAT EVERYONE IN THERE WHEN ONE OF COURSE IS THE IS KEEPING MY AGE ONLY EDUCATION UP THERE ARE A LOT OF ORIOLES ON THE- COMMISSION WEBSITE THAT ARE NEW- EITHER ON THE INDUSTRY WORK ARE TARGETED AT LICENSEES STATE. AS THEY ENTER THE PROCESS OR JUST BY AND WATCHING ALL OF THOSE ARE CONTINUING TO. SPEAK WITH THE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ON A BAXTER AND- THE LEAD ATTORNEYS AND- THE STAFF AT THE COMMISSION OFFICE AT LEAST AS MUCH AS I CAN SINCE WERE WERE ALL DOING IT ALL VIRTUALLY. AND EVEN OF INCREDIBLE HELP. TO BRING ME UP TO SPEED AND HOW THE INTERESTED INDUSTRY WORKS BUT AS IMPORTANTLY THE HISTORY OF HOW OLD THE GIRL UP AND COME TO THIS POINT- SO IT'S JUST IT'S JUST AN ONGOING PROCESS IT'LL BE AWHILE. I THINK WHILE- TO REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE AND KIND OF HIT HIT THAT STRIDE I TEND TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE AGAIN ACCESS A SENSIBILITY FAIRNESS. I MEAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS IS GOING ON THEN OUR CHANCES ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST ENTERING INTO THE INDUSTRY ARE LOOKING FOR A LICENSE FOR TRYING TO GET A JOB- MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND IT AS WELL. AND AS A FRIEND ASKED ME THE OTHER DAY WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH THEM- THEY SAID EXPLAINED IT TO ME LIKE A LIKE I'M A KINDERGARTEN. AND I FORTUNATELY HAVING TAUGHT KINDERGARTEN THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR ME TO DO TO KIND OF BREAK IT DOWN- BUT I'M I'M STILL LEARNING AND I DON'T EVEN PRETEND TO. KNOW EVERYTHING YET- BE THE EXPERT THAT I AT LEAST I HOPE TO BE COMING OUT SOON AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR OF OUR OWN CHAIR. AND- AND STAFFS. THANK YOU. A MAN SURE JUST HAVE QUESTION FOR YOU IF THAT'S A- YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT THREE. TO THE REYES. THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE BY THE COMMISSION- CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW IT'S AFFECTED THE INDUSTRY. I'M TALKING ABOUT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WITH KOBE. AND THEN- AT HOW IT'S AFFECTED THE INDUSTRY AND SHOULD ANY EMERGENCY RECKITT REGULATIONS BE CONTINUED OR SHOULD WE ADOPT NEW REGULATIONS- FROM WHAT WAS ADOPTED PREVIOUSLY. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION YES SO THE COMMISSION- IN ADDITION TO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE- DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND OSHA- WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN. HELPING TO- CROSSING GUIDELINES FOR THE INDUSTRY- OF COURSE THEY HAVE THE HARDSHIP LIKE MANY OF THE BUSINESSES WHEN THEY HAD TO CLOSE- AND WHEN I GOT TIME TO RE OPEN. HOW DO LEVY OPEN SAFELY. SO WORKING CLOSELY GUIDELINES FOR THEM- TO SAFELY REOPEN IT ONE OF THOSE INCLUDED OUTDOOR OPERATIONS THAN THAT CAME A LITTLE BIT LATER ON. BUT THE EMERGENCY BRAKES PACKAGE THEN CONSISTED OF LET ME LET ME BACK UP JUST ONE MORE MINUTE IN TERMS OF THINGS THAT WERE OUTSIDE OF THE REGULATIONS. SO WE DID- WORK TO- EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN PLACE THAT WOULD GIVE THEM SOME RELIEF BY PUSHING BACK THE DATE. WHEN FOR EXAMPLE THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE DUE WITCHING BACKDATES WHEN THEIR TABLE FEES WOULD BE DO SO WE DIDN'T DO THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES TO GIVE THEM SOME RELIEF. WHEN THEY HAD TO HAVE THE DOORS CLOSE FULLY EMERGENCY RENTALS TO HELP THEM- SAFELY RE OPENED- THEIR DOORS FOR BUSINESS. AND AROUND THAT CAME ONE WAS- TO ALLOW THE COLOR OF MY ACCOUNT. SOME OF THESE CARTOONS ARE VERY SMALL AND SO THE- NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE COUNT ROOM BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HAVE THE WITNESSES AND WE HAVE TO. THE CHECKS AND BALANCES SOME OF THEM WERE- ARE VERY SMALL AND THEIR PROBLEMS IS VERY SMALL SO THEY CAN ACCOMMODATE BECAUSE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING RULES THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE HAVING THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE SET INTO THE ROAD. SO WE WILL WE ALLOW THEM THE REGULATION WOULD ALLOW THEM TO HAVE REMOTE- HAVE SOMEONE LOOKING REMOTELY TO DO THE CHECKS AND BALANCES. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THEM- THE OTHER. WAS WITH. RESPECT TO- THERE ARE THERE ARE TALK ABOUT THE FEES BUT WE RESPECT TO- IF YOU JUST ALLOW ME ONE SECOND I KIND OF ABSOLUTELY. ELSEWHERE. SO WE ARE EVENTUALLY I HAD TO LEGISLATION BOOK WORK WITH WHICH IS AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN AND THAT GAVE THEM RELEASED FROM- FROM FEES FOR TWO YEAR PERIOD OF TIME SO WE'RE HAPPY THAT THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT INTO LAW AND THAT WOULD GIVE THEM SOME SOME RELIEF AS WELL. SO I THINK THAT WHAT WE DID- ALLOW THEM TO OPEN SAFELY- OPEN THE DOORS BACK FROM BUSINESS TO AND- A LOT OF THE PUBLIC BACK IN I WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DO SANITATION PLAN HAVE THAT SANITATION PLAN- HANDED IN TO THE TO THE BUREAU INTO THE COMMISSION SO THAT THEY CAN BE CHECKED- AND- THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO SAFELY OPEN SO I THINK IT WAS I THINK WHAT WE DID WAS VERY HELPFUL FOR THEM AND GOING FORWARD WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO SEE- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE- AS ERIC MENTIONED WITH THIS DELTA VARIANT. I DON'T KNOW THAT SOME F THESE REGULATIONS. WOULD NEED TO BE LOOKED AT. WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE DID TO IS. WHEN WAS GOING TO BE TIME TO RE. THIS THE JUNE FIFTY THEY WE WENT BACK WE- THE RIGHT. AND THE ARE. ADJUSTED SO THAT. SOME OF THE IT ESPECIALLY SENATE PLANTS SO THAT THEY COULD LOOK TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAKE IT LOOK TO THE- CDC AND OSHA GUIDELINES IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH THE PLANS THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE IN ORDER. TO DO THE SANITATION SO. SOME OF THESE CONTINUE. CURRENTLY THE WAY IT IS THEY BY OPERATION OF LAW THEY'RE GOING TO EXPIRE. BUT WE VISIT AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE TO CONTINUE ON IN THE FUTURE- BY WAY OF ANOTHER REGULATION. ALSO WE'RE UNDER- CONSTANTLY EVALUATING- WHAT THE WHAT. DO I DO BUT IT IS GOING TO DEPEND A LOT ON WHAT HAPPENS JUST THIS. THIS AREA THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL IT THAT'S WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING WITH AND- I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. KEEP THINGS I'M GOING. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR VERY MUCH AND- I DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS AGAIN LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR EVERYONE.

WATER ENERGY- ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH US FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE- THAT THE COMMISSION MAY BE LOOKING AT I KNOW THIS IMPACTS THE INDIVIDUAL- ENTITIES BUT- ANYTHING YOU'VE HAD AN UPDATE ON THAT YOU WOULD SHARE WITH US ON CYBER SECURITY. AND CYBER THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO IN CYBER SECURITY IN GENERAL YEAH SO EACH OF THE- CARD ROOMS WOULD- HAVE TO HAVE HEIR OWN PLANS WE DON'T HAVE- BUT AT LEAST ON THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED ANYTHING FIVE THAT WOULD TO- GIVE THEM DIRECTION ARE AND- THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY VERY INTERESTING QUITE- AND IS TO MY KNOWLEDGE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED BY ANYONE- WITH THAT BUT I WILL SAY THAT WE DO HAVE A VERY VERY.
