COMMITTEE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET BUT WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR HERE. SO WE WILL ALLOW OUR AUTHOR TO GO AHEAD AND PRESENT OUR FIRST BILL SENATE BILL. TWO FIFTY THREE RELATED TO THE CANNELLA ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY FIVE MORTY MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. ESTABLISHING THE MINISTER. AN INCENTIVE BASED CONSERVATION PROGRAM. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE PROGRAM TO OPTIMIZE WILDLIFE HABITAT BENEFITS WHILE SUPPORTING THE ECONOMIC VITALITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS. AGRICULTURE OBVIOUSLY IS A MAJOR INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO VALUABLE OPEN SPACE AND WILD LIFE HABITAT. THE MAYES WITH DECISIONS AND CONSERVATION PRACTICES OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS ALSO ENHANCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. PROVIDE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND OFFER SOCIAL BENEFITS. IN RECENT YEARS THE DELIVERY OF ON FARM CONSERVATION PRACTICES AS THE CLIENT. THE DECLINE IS DRIVEN BY THE RISING COST OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION INCLUDING WATER IN ENERGY COSTS. MORE RESOURCES AND TOOLS ARE NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND PROVIDE MULTIPLE CONSERVATION BENEFITS. TO ON FARM PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THE INCENTIVE BASED CONSERVATION PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS. WHO WANT TO VOLUNTARILY MAKE WILDLIFE FRIENDLY IMPROVEMENTS ON THEIR LET? THE PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS TO CREATE FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT. AND PROVIDE ADDED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED WATER. THE EROSION CONTROL AND CONSERVE CONSERVATION OF BROWN WATER. OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS BY THE LEGISLATURE. SB TWO FIFTY THREE IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WHICH IS HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. FOR THE BILL. THE MORNING TERM WOMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS LIZ FORCED BURKE AND I AM THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. WE ARE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. TWO FIFTY OF CALIFORNIA'S APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED MILLION ACRES FORTY THREE MILLION ACRES ARGUES FOR AGRICULTURE AND HE'S WORKING FARMS AND RANCHES PRODUCE MUCH OF THE COUNTRY'S FOOD AND FIBER. THESE WORKING LADS ALSO PROVIDE MUCH OF OUR STATES OPEN SPACE AND HABITATS THAT WILDLIFE NEED. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD ESTABLISH NEW PROGRAM PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS WANT TO VOLUNTARILY MAKE CONSERVATION IMPROVEMENTS ON THEIR LAND. WITH THE HELP FROM AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING INCENTIVE PROGRAM CREATED IN TWO FIFTY THREE PRODUCERS WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ON FARM PRACTICES THAT DELIVER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. SUCH AS IMPROVED WATER AIR QUALITY CONSERVE GROUNDWATER OR SURFACE WATER. OR CREATED WILDLIFE HABITAT SOME OF THESE HABITAT PROJECTS COULD INCLUDE WILDLIFE FAMILY FARMING FENCING THAT ALLOWS FOR SAFE WILD LIFE MOVEMENT. FLOODING RICE FIELDS FOR MIGRATORY BIRD HABITAT GOOD FOR FISH WHICH MISTER CORNWELL WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT. MORE RESOURCES AND TOOLS ARE NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WITH SUPPORT SCIENCE DRIVEN INVESTMENTS THE DELIVER BENEFITS TO PUBLIC ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT CAN BE REASONABLY EXPECTED THAT LENDERS COULD PROVIDE ON THEIR OWN. ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING INCENTIVE PROGRAM WOULD BE SIMILAR TO USDA'S NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION SERVICE PROGRAM BUT WOULD BE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SUITE OF ON FARM PRACTICES BEST SUITED TO ME CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE RESOURCE NEEDS. CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER IN THE STATE SHOULD DO MORE TO INCENTIVIZE INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION PROGRAMS THAT WILL HAVE TANGIBLE BENEFITS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. AND HELP IMPROVE OUR FARM AND RANCH LANDS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE SIR. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO FIFTY THREE MY NAME IS ROGER CORNWELL AND ON THE GENERAL MANAGER OF RIVER GARDEN FARMS. RIVER GARDEN FARMS -- OWNS AND OPERATES. OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF CORN WALNUTS RICE ALFALFA. SUNFLOWER SAFFLOWER AND WE'D ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. IN YOLO INCLUDES THE COUNTIES. REGARDING FARM HAS BEEN FAMILY OWNED AND OPERATED SINCE. NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR AND OUR SECOND THIRD GENERATION OF OWNERS ARE DEDICATED TO PROGRESSIVE FARMING. AND EING AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. ON THE FARM THERE'S BEEN A LONG STANDING COMMITMENT TO MANAGE. RESOURCES AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS FOR ECO SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS BOTH FISH AND WILDLIFE. AS A RESULT WE HAVE DIRECT EXPENSES EXPERIENCE SORRY WITH THE TYPES OF ACTIONS THAT THIS BILL WOULD INCENTIVIZE AND PROMOTE. TO BRIEFLY OUTLINE TWO EXAMPLES OF OF ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN. FIRST OUR FARMERS PARTICIPATED IN THE TNC BIRD RETURNS PROGRAM TO HELP OPTIMIZE. THE WATERBERG HABITAT BENEFITS IN ARE SEASONALLY FLOODED RICE FIELDS. IN ADDITION TO DECOMPOSING RICE STRAW THIS PREPARES THE FIELDS FOR NEXT YEAR'S PLANTING. THIS PRACTICE PROVIDES CRITICAL HABITAT FOR MIGRATING SHOREBIRDS AS WELL. SECONDLY WE CURRENTLY PARTNER WITH CAL TROUT UC DAVIS AND OTHERS TO DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY OF FLOODED RICE FIELDS TO GROW FISH. SO PLANKTON ANOTHER BUGS OR WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL FLOODING PLAY. THAT CAN BE REINTRODUCED INTO THE SACRAMENTO RIVER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CHINOOK SALMON. AND THE WIDER FOOD WEB. RIVER GARDEN FARMS IS UNIQUE. WITH A SUPPORTIVE PARTNERSHIP. GROUP AND AND THE SIZE TO TAKE ON THESE ACTIONS AT SCALE WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE. AND EXPLORE NEW WAYS TO ENHANCE FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT. BUT WE ARE ALWAYS AWARE. OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE COMPETING IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY WE NEED TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WILL CREATE A FRAMEWORK AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WILL PROMOTE ACTIONS THAT CAN BENEFIT OUR ECONOMY. AND THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS STREAMLINED INCENTIVES.
