PERSPECTIVES.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.634 region:rollup2
ON SOME VERY IMPORTANT TOPICS

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.469 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR

QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.739 region:rollup2
DIS DID.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.975 region:rollup2

UP MUCH MORE OFTEN AND THE

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:59.079 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS HAVE BECOME MUCH

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.880 region:rollup2
MORE COMPLEX THAN THEY USED TO

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.349 region:rollup2
DO.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.885 region:rollup2
IT I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.187 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:09.489 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE WALLS OF CAL STIRS IN

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.956 region:rollup2
CALPERS WHO WE REALIZE DON'T

TRICKLE OVER TO THE CAPITOL

CORRIDORS AND SO WHILE YOU MAY

NOT HEAR DISCUSSIONS THAT HAPPEN

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:22.169 region:rollup2
REGARDING ENGAGEMENT OR

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.537 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.337 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ARE NOT TAKING

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.472 region:rollup2
PLACE.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.473 region:rollup2
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.240 region:rollup2

ENGAGEMENT? AND WE APPRECIATE

INVESTMENT DIVISIONS ON THE

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:38.652 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.821 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:42.889 region:rollup2
COLORFUL BUT WE APPRECIATE THE

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:44.257 region:rollup2
FACT THAT CALCIUM'S TRIES TO

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.093 region:rollup2
ENGAGE WITH COMPANIES.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:49.096 region:rollup2
AND TRIES TO USE THE VALUES

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:50.497 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE TO SHAPE CHANGE

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:51.965 region:rollup2
AND SYSTEMIC CHANGES VERY

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.766 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND IT'S NOT OVER

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.401 region:rollup2
NIGHT.

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:56.369 region:rollup2
CAL STIRS ALWAYS LOOKS AT

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:58.371 region:rollup2
ISSUES OVER A VERY LONG TERM

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.906 region:rollup2
HORIZON WHICH DOES NOT ALWAYS

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.740 region:rollup2
TAKE THE PLATE TAKE PLACE AND

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:04.344 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.913 region:rollup2
THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE HAVE

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:09.649 region:rollup2
WON'T DURING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:11.818 region:rollup2
EITHER ENGAGEMENT OR DIVESTMENT

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.153 region:rollup2
IN THE WALLS OF THE CAPITAL IS

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:14.654 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:16.690 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT FUNDING

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:20.360 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS. IT WAS ALWAYS

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.562 region:rollup2
COMPLEX EVEN BEFORE WE HAD AB

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.731 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN SIXTEEN I AM BUT AS YOU

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:27.234 region:rollup2

FULLY FUND CAL STIRS OVER A

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.380 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF THIRTY TWO YEARS.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:42.015 region:rollup2
NOW WHEN THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.150 region:rollup2
ABOUT DIVESTMENT SHOULD THERE BE

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:45.519 region:rollup2
ANY COST IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.286 region:rollup2
DOES IT HAVE A COST TO THE FUND

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.654 region:rollup2
WILL MORE WORKING ON IN.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.022 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THE LONG TERM COSTS

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:49.689 region:rollup2
OF CAL STICKERS BUT THAT ALSO

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.024 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.525 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION RATES THAT OUR

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.592 region:rollup2

STIRRERS.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.861 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY IN THIS IS A VERY

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.562 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED SO I CAN'T FIT INTO

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:56.563 region:rollup2
THREE MINUTES.

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:57.964 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS

00:04:56.563 --> 00:04:58.932 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THAT COULD LEAD TO

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.668 region:rollup2
LONG TERM INCREASES

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:02.869 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY TO OUR NEW S.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:04.671 region:rollup2

THIRTEEN.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:09.142 region:rollup2
SO JUST AS THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.677 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE TEACHER

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:12.479 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.814 region:rollup2

YOU COULD HAVE UNINTENDED

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:20.987 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF EXACERBATING THE

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.922 region:rollup2
TEACHER SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.924 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DEAL WITH

SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT'S VERY

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:27.727 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:30.263 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL IN FACT BATES ISSUES

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:31.998 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME NEVER THE LAST

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:33.600 region:rollup2

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:50.937 region:rollup2
FOR MANAGING SYSTEMIC RISK.

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:53.273 region:rollup2
WHEN WE SAY SYSTEMIC RISKS WE'RE

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:55.408 region:rollup2
TALKING BOUT RISK. SO BIG THAT

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:56.643 region:rollup2
THEY AFFECT EVERY ASSET CLASS

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:58.778 region:rollup2

THE.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:03.683 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE RISKS LIKE CLIMATE

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:05.151 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND WATER MANAGEMENT.

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:07.087 region:rollup2
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN CERTAIN

MANY DIFFERENT COMPANIES.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:13.727 region:rollup2
THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMIC RISK

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:16.596 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE DEALT. BY ONE INVESTOR

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:18.732 region:rollup2
WITH ONE PORTION OF OUR

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:19.366 region:rollup2
ACCOMPANYING AND THEIR HOLDINGS

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:20.600 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY HAVE TO BE DEALT

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:22.769 region:rollup2
WITH COLLABORATIVELY.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.938 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY WE NEED TO HAVE A

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:27.107 region:rollup2
PLAN TO REALLY IMPACT THE ENTIRE

00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:28.375 region:rollup2

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:29.943 region:rollup2
STORES OF BOTH LEAD THAT WORK

WITH US.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:33.980 region:rollup2
I WANNA GIVE JUST THREE QUICK

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:36.483 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES NOTHING IS ONE OF THE.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.451 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANT EMISSIONS THAT

00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:40.620 region:rollup2
IS AFFECTING CLIMATE CHANGES TO

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:41.788 region:rollup2
IT ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.490 region:rollup2
AND CAO STIRS UNDERTOOK A

00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:45.692 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.727 region:rollup2
REALLY BEGIN TO ADDRESS METHANE.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:49.262 region:rollup2
IN THEIR PORTFOLIO.

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:51.531 region:rollup2
THEY LED A DIALOGUE WITH THE

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:54.434 region:rollup2
SERIES OF FOURTEEN COMPANIES

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:56.369 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY ON FILING RESOLUTIONS

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:57.470 region:rollup2
WITH A SMALLER SUBSET OF THOSE

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.506 region:rollup2
WHO WILL NOT RESPOND.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.441 region:rollup2
THE DIALOGUE

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:03.176 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY GETTING. FIRM

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.811 region:rollup2
COMMITMENTS FROM THESE BIG OIL

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:05.311 region:rollup2
AND GAS COMPANIES TO MANAGE

00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:07.480 region:rollup2
THEIR METHANE EMISSIONS

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.948 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.617 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMITMENTS LED TO THE

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:12.352 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL OF RESOLUTIONS THEY

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:15.054 region:rollup2
DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO TO A

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:16.990 region:rollup2
VOTE. BUT THAT SIGNAL FOURTEEN

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:19.993 region:rollup2
BIG COMPANIES LED BY ONE OF THE

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:22.295 region:rollup2
LARGEST INVESTORS IN THE U. S.

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:24.130 region:rollup2
IMPACTS THE ENTIRE WORLD. ALL OF

THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TAKES

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.901 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT METHANE EMISSIONS MUST

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:29.602 region:rollup2
BE MANAGED DIFFERENTLY TO

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:31.004 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL RISK A

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:32.839 region:rollup2
RISK THAT WILL AFFECT NOT ONLY

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:35.408 region:rollup2
THOSE COMPANIES. AND THE

00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:37.143 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIOS OF EVERY INVESTOR BUT

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.945 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY RISK THAT WILL AFFECT

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:42.048 region:rollup2
OUR PLANET AS WELL.

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:43.950 region:rollup2
CALPERS SIMILARLY UNDERTOOK A.

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:45.552 region:rollup2
OF REAL LEADERSHIP ROLE WITH

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.987 region:rollup2
EXXON MOBIL LAST YEAR

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:50.090 region:rollup2
EXXON MOBIL AND WE DEMANDED A

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:52.025 region:rollup2
TWO DEGREE SCENARIO ANALYSIS.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.893 region:rollup2
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THIS COMPANY

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:56.863 region:rollup2
IF WE MANAGE TO KEEP GLOBAL

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:57.397 region:rollup2
WARMING UNDER? TWO DEGREES IN

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:58.665 region:rollup2
ACCORDANCE WITH THE PARIS

00:09:57.397 --> 00:09:59.332 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT.

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.733 region:rollup2
CALPERS SAID WE WANT TO SEE YOUR

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:02.635 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:04.003 region:rollup2
UP UNTIL THAT POINT EXXON HAD

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.371 region:rollup2
BEEN SAYING WE DON'T THINK WE

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:06.339 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO ANY ANALYSIS BECAUSE

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.907 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT IN THE RANGE OF

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:10.343 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES.

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:11.411 region:rollup2
THEY WERE REFUSING TO CONSIDER

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:12.979 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE LONG

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:14.781 region:rollup2
RUN IF THAT IF THAT REALITY

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:17.283 region:rollup2
BECAME TRUE.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:18.585 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY CALPERS FILED THE

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.653 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION LED THE PROXY

00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:21.921 region:rollup2
SOLICITATION AND SIXTY TWO

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:22.388 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE SHARE OWNERS

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:25.592 region:rollup2
VOTED FOR IT REQUIRING

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:27.093 region:rollup2
EXTOLLING.

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:29.028 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT ANALYSIS

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:30.597 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ANALYSIS NOW THERE'S

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:32.665 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND THE MEAN

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:34.400 region:rollup2
FESTERS LIKE CALPERS AND CAL

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:36.703 region:rollup2
STIRS CAN EVALUATE THE REST.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.539 region:rollup2
TO THEIR PORTFOLIO AGAIN SENDING

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:41.307 region:rollup2
A SIGNAL TO OTHERS IN THE SECTOR

00:10:39.539 --> 00:10:43.409 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD TO OTHER

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:45.612 region:rollup2

DUTY.

00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:53.520 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE SECOND EXAMPLE IN THE

00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:56.489 region:rollup2
THIRTY EXAMPLE CALPERS HAS.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.291 region:rollup2
RECENTLY STARTED AN INITIATIVE

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.859 region:rollup2
WITH SIRIUS AND OTHER INVESTOR

00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:01.394 region:rollup2
NETWORKS AROUND THE WORLD A

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:03.296 region:rollup2
EUROPEAN NETWORK

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:05.999 region:rollup2
STRAND HIS NETWORK. AND THEN

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:08.368 region:rollup2
ASIAN THAT WORK TOGETHER ON

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:10.003 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING ENGAGING. THE HUNDRED

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:12.305 region:rollup2
HEAVIEST DEMENTORS IN THE

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:14.173 region:rollup2
CALPERS AND OTHER PORTFOLIOS FOR

YOU KNOW UNIVERSAL INVESTORS

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:17.343 region:rollup2
MANY OF THESE HEAVIER MEMBERS.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:18.511 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTERS ARE THE

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:20.713 region:rollup2
SAME.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:22.782 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE DECIDED TO WORK WITH

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:24.918 region:rollup2
THESE HUNDRED COMPANIES TO BEGIN

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:26.920 region:rollup2

GETTING TO SCIENCE BASE OR GETS.

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:37.830 region:rollup2
TO A REDUCE THE EMISSIONS.

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:39.832 region:rollup2
THAT PLAN WE WE BELIEVE WILL

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.367 region:rollup2
AFFECT ALL OF THESE COMPANIES

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:42.669 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD IT WILL

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.270 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY CHANGE THE WAY

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:46.039 region:rollup2
INVESTORS ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.473 region:rollup2
THESE RISKS.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.809 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN REMEMBERING THAT THESE

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:51.878 region:rollup2
RISKS ARE SYSTEMIC WHAT HAPPENS

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:53.613 region:rollup2
IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR WILL

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:55.848 region:rollup2
HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT VERSIONS SO

MANY OTHER SECTORS OF THE.

00:11:55.848 --> 00:12:14.234 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS FOR FROM OUR

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:14.234 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE A VERY EFFECTIVE

A AT THE.

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:12.959 region:rollup2

FORCES US TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:15.561 region:rollup2
NO OUR PENSION FUNDS

FOR THOSE PROMISES.

00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:02.641 region:rollup2

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:41.547 region:rollup2
THIRD OF

00:19:39.078 --> 00:19:43.382 region:rollup2
BALANCE BETWEEN SAYING WELL YOU

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:44.216 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU MADE REFERENCE TO

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:45.317 region:rollup2
YOUNG DIVESTMENT IS BEING ONE

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:46.852 region:rollup2
WAY TO PUT SOME PRESSURE BUT

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:47.953 region:rollup2
ALSO ENGAGEMENT.

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.355 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT IF YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:51.457 region:rollup2
A STE.

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:52.992 region:rollup2
SHAREOWNER.

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:54.326 region:rollup2
YOU HEAR IT OUT OF YOUR ABILITY

00:19:52.992 --> 00:19:55.795 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE THEREFORE

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:57.963 region:rollup2
DIMINISHES AS WELL I MEAN

00:19:55.795 --> 00:19:59.465 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY YOU SENT A SIGNAL BY

00:19:57.963 --> 00:20:01.333 region:rollup2
SAYING WE'RE JUST HOPE OUR MONEY

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:06.539 region:rollup2
THERE BUT. MAYBE WE CAN PERHAPS.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:09.675 region:rollup2
R. MIGHT TOUCH ON THAT.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:12.678 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:15.181 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL.

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:17.483 region:rollup2
THEY'LL FIND.

00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:19.585 region:rollup2
AND HIS RIGHT.

00:20:17.483 --> 00:20:24.423 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERSHIP.

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:26.625 region:rollup2
IBM.

00:20:24.423 --> 00:20:30.729 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED BECAUSE YOU ARE.

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:35.835 region:rollup2
WAY.

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:40.272 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S WAY HIGH ALSO. HOMES

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:44.243 region:rollup2
BROWN.

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:51.584 region:rollup2
IF NEW EVENYOU SAY OKAY OUR

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:54.820 region:rollup2
ATHLETES. ALL BETTER TIME.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:57.790 region:rollup2
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:21:01.393 region:rollup2
OKAY MAKING FUNNY BUT WE MONITOR

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:04.764 region:rollup2
PASSED.

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:05.331 region:rollup2
I HARDLY THINK.

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:05.731 region:rollup2
MOBILE AS PART OF THE WHOLE

00:21:05.331 --> 00:21:06.332 region:rollup2
THING.

00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:12.438 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATE ONE ASPECT THAT HAS

00:21:06.332 --> 00:21:13.973 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:16.108 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUSLY CONSIDERED IS

00:21:13.973 --> 00:21:18.210 region:rollup2
EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:20.045 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS PROPOSALS SOME

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:23.415 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT MEASURES.

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:25.451 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE SUDAN YOU NO LONGER

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:27.486 region:rollup2
HAVE ONE SUDAN ANYMORE BUT YET

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:29.555 region:rollup2
THERE HASN'T BEEN A MECHANISM TO

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:31.056 region:rollup2
REEVALUATE SHOULD THAT BE CHANGE

00:21:29.555 --> 00:21:32.758 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ELIMINATED ACCEPT IRA

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:34.360 region:rollup2
SO. IF YOU HAVE A POLICY

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:37.496 region:rollup2
MECHANISM WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.997 region:rollup2
AT DID YOU TO ACHIEVE THE POLICY

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:38.664 region:rollup2
GOAL THAT YOU SET OUT TO

00:21:37.997 --> 00:21:41.467 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE.

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:45.271 region:rollup2
IN ADITION WHERE THERE ANY

00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:47.106 region:rollup2
FISCAL IMPACTS OF THAT AND WHO

00:21:45.271 --> 00:21:48.107 region:rollup2
IS PAYING THE PRICE

00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:49.575 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:51.610 region:rollup2
THAT FROM A LONGER TERM

00:21:49.575 --> 00:21:53.179 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE FROM AS A BODY THAT

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.880 region:rollup2
MIGHT HELP. THIS INSTITUTION TO

00:21:53.179 --> 00:21:55.781 region:rollup2
FIND A WAY THAT MIGHT BE THE

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.050 region:rollup2
MOST EFFECTIVE IN HAVING NOT

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:59.985 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION PROVIDED THAT. THE

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.854 region:rollup2
FIRST STEP IS ENGAGEMENT AND

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:05.024 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE SUCCESSFULLY I USE

00:22:01.854 --> 00:22:07.593 region:rollup2
ALL THE TOOLS THAT YOU HAVE IN

00:22:05.024 --> 00:22:09.161 region:rollup2
THAT TOOL BOX AND THEN EVALUATE

00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:10.563 region:rollup2
IF YOU ARE GOING TO TO PULL THAT

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:12.198 region:rollup2
TRIGGER WHO'S GOING TO PY THE

00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:13.732 region:rollup2
COST IN IS THERE AGREEMENT THAT

00:22:12.198 --> 00:22:15.401 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:17.837 region:rollup2
PLAY DOT. COSTS

00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:18.737 region:rollup2
THE DILEMMA THAT WE HAVE IS THAT

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:20.506 region:rollup2
YOU USED TO HAVE.

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:22.074 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT ISSUES SPORADICALLY

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:24.543 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED THAT IS NOT THE CASE

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:25.978 region:rollup2
ANYMORE WHICH IS ABOUT CREATING

00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:28.280 region:rollup2
A BIT MORE PRESSURE SO IF THERE

00:22:25.978 --> 00:22:30.749 region:rollup2
IS A WAY THAT THIS BODY CAN PULL

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.984 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS INTO

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:33.552 region:rollup2
ONE'S SO INSTEAD OF HAVING

00:22:31.984 --> 00:22:35.454 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS BILLS INTRODUCED

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:37.523 region:rollup2
REGARDING DIVESTMENT. IF THAT IS

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:39.558 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE THE TREND IS THERE

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:43.162 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO SAY

00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:44.964 region:rollup2
LET'S EVALUATE ALL OF THESE RANK

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:47.233 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE AND ALSO ASSESS THE

00:22:44.964 --> 00:22:49.134 region:rollup2
CUMULATIVE COST. AND THEN DECIDE

00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:51.136 region:rollup2
WHICH DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO

00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:52.805 region:rollup2
IN THAT MIGHT AT LEAST HELP THIS

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:54.540 region:rollup2
BODY TO FIND A MORE EFFECTIVE

00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:56.942 region:rollup2
WAY TO HAVE A MACRO DISCUSSION

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.745 region:rollup2
ON WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE TRYING

00:22:56.942 --> 00:23:00.813 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVE.

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:02.748 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THOUGH I

00:23:00.813 --> 00:23:03.515 region:rollup2
THINK OUR MEMBERS REALLY THINK

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:05.918 region:rollup2
ABOUT DIVESTMENT FROM A RISK AND

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:07.152 region:rollup2
OFFER TO.

00:23:05.918 --> 00:23:08.187 region:rollup2
SO AS I DESCRIBED R. ENGAGEMENTS

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:09.822 region:rollup2
ARE OFTEN REALLY FOCUSED ON

00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:12.091 region:rollup2
GETTING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:15.327 region:rollup2
HOW RISKY. THE BEHAVIOR OF THIS

00:23:12.091 --> 00:23:16.395 region:rollup2
COMPANY IS IN A MATERIAL WAY IN

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:18.597 region:rollup2
A WAY I THINK IMPACT THE VALUE

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:20.399 region:rollup2
OF THE COMPANY. AND THE VALUE OF

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:21.600 region:rollup2
OUR LONG TERM HOLDINGS FOR THE

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:23.035 region:rollup2
PENSIONS.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.770 region:rollup2
IF YOU THINK FROM THAT RISK

00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:26.538 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE THEN IT FELL OVER

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.606 region:rollup2
TIME OUR ENGAGEMENTS LEAD US TO

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:28.574 region:rollup2
THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:30.643 region:rollup2
COMPANIES FOR EXAMPLE THE OIL

00:23:28.574 --> 00:23:32.077 region:rollup2
AND GAS COMPANIES. REALLY ARE

00:23:30.643 --> 00:23:34.346 region:rollup2
NOT MOVING IN THE WAY THE WHOLE

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:35.648 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IS MOVING THEY'RE GOING

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:37.549 region:rollup2
TO BE STRANDED ASSETS THEY'RE

00:23:35.648 --> 00:23:39.451 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND. SOME

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:42.454 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE MUCH WORSE THAN

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:43.055 region:rollup2
OTHERS WE MAY WANNA UNDERWEIGHT.

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:44.924 region:rollup2
AND SO RATHER THAN SAYING A

00:23:43.055 --> 00:23:46.659 region:rollup2
BLANKET DIVESTMENT WE MAY SAY

00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:49.261 region:rollup2
WELL THESE ARE JUST TOO RISKY

00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:50.596 region:rollup2
FOR THE PORTFOLIO WE REDUCE OUR

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:51.764 region:rollup2
HOLDINGS IN THESE.

00:23:50.596 --> 00:23:53.832 region:rollup2
WE OP OUR HOLDINGS IN

00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:55.501 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES AS JODY DESCRIBED

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:57.469 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE

00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:59.371 region:rollup2
REALLY GOING TO PRODUCE VALUE IN

00:23:57.469 --> 00:24:02.007 region:rollup2
THE LONG RUN AND THAT'S. THAT'S

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:02.908 region:rollup2
THE WAY MANY OF OUR MEMBERS TALK

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:05.811 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:07.646 region:rollup2
A ONE TIME GET OUT AND STAY OUT.

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:10.049 region:rollup2
BUT RATHER REALLY THINKING ABOUT

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:16.188 region:rollup2
RISK MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE

00:24:10.049 --> 00:24:18.023 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO A FROSTED.

00:24:16.188 --> 00:24:19.024 region:rollup2
YES THAT IS AMERICAN DOWN I I

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:20.092 region:rollup2
HAVE A QUESTION MAYBE IT'S BEEN

00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:21.026 region:rollup2
ASKED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER AND

00:24:20.092 --> 00:24:23.729 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S NOT FOR THIS PANEL

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:25.531 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S FOR SUBSEQUENT PANEL

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:27.1000 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S ARGUMENT ANSWER.

00:24:25.531 --> 00:24:29.101 region:rollup2
BUT JOE YOU COME FROM A CONCORD

00:24:27.1000 --> 00:24:30.235 region:rollup2
SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FUND. IS

00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:31.603 region:rollup2
THAT CORRECT.

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:32.204 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:33.205 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE COST OF GOING THAT

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:34.606 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:36.308 region:rollup2
FIRST A FUND THAT REALLY DOESN'T

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:37.743 region:rollup2
LABEL ITSELF.

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:40.045 region:rollup2
SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WHAT'S THE

00:24:37.743 --> 00:24:41.847 region:rollup2
IMPACT.

00:24:40.045 --> 00:24:43.315 region:rollup2
S. STIRS AND PURRS INDIVIDUALLY

00:24:41.847 --> 00:24:44.717 region:rollup2
ON THAT HAS THERE BEEN ANY IN

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.918 region:rollup2
MAYBE MAYBE THIS FOR ANOTHER

00:24:44.717 --> 00:24:47.553 region:rollup2
PANEL MAYBE THIS CHANCE QUESTION

00:24:45.918 --> 00:24:49.455 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE ANSWERED TODAY. BUT HAS

00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:50.923 region:rollup2
THERE BEEN A REPORT PRODUCES

00:24:49.455 --> 00:24:52.157 region:rollup2
SHOWS.

00:24:50.923 --> 00:24:57.396 region:rollup2
WHERE WOULD WE BE HAD WE NOT

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:58.931 region:rollup2
GONE THIS DIRECTION VERSUS?

00:24:57.396 --> 00:24:59.998 region:rollup2
THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN ONE OF THE

00:24:58.931 --> 00:25:01.300 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT.

00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:03.769 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE ASKED.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:06.572 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT ARE IN

00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:08.207 region:rollup2
IN ILLINOIS IS HAS BEEN ANSWERED

00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:08.407 region:rollup2
OF IT IT IS YOU KNOW MAYBE I

00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:10.376 region:rollup2
JUST.

00:25:08.407 --> 00:25:11.744 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THE

00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:12.478 region:rollup2
BOARDS OF SISTERS AND PURRS HAVE

00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:14.680 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT.

00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:16.115 region:rollup2
AND.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.449 region:rollup2
SO IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS

00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:18.751 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ASKED ME.

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:19.518 region:rollup2
SO IN I THINK THERE'S ARE SOME

00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:21.854 region:rollup2
ANALYSES AVAILABLE WE WILL WE

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:24.223 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE THE INVEST THE

00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:25.891 region:rollup2
THE DIRECT THE THE DCS AND AND

00:25:24.223 --> 00:25:27.693 region:rollup2
AND AND AND ADDRESS IMPRESSIONS

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:29.828 region:rollup2
FROM FROM BOTH FUNDS. IN THE

00:25:27.693 --> 00:25:31.230 region:rollup2
FUTURE ENOUGH PANEL LATER ON SO

00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:32.898 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU MIGHT YOU COULD ASK

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.899 region:rollup2
THEM THAT.

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:36.268 region:rollup2
AS WELL IT THEY MAY ACTUALLY

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:37.770 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:40.472 region:rollup2
OTHER THEY MAY BE NODDING THEIR

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:42.141 region:rollup2
HEADS RIGHT. THOUGHT PAT ARE NOT

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:43.575 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT ONLY BLACK BUT

00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:46.812 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN SOME WORK

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:48.247 region:rollup2
DONE IN THAT AREA IS IS REALLY

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:49.148 region:rollup2
THAT'S. WHAT WILL WANT TO KNOW?

00:25:48.247 --> 00:25:49.748 region:rollup2
WHAT I WANNA?

00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:50.749 region:rollup2
YOU A MORE.

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:52.818 region:rollup2
FOCUSES

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:54.820 region:rollup2
COST.

00:25:52.818 --> 00:25:56.922 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU'RE INVESTING

00:25:54.820 --> 00:26:01.126 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE.

00:25:56.922 --> 00:26:01.794 region:rollup2
MATTER AND IF YOU'RE.

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:04.963 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MY TAKING IT TO RISK

00:26:01.794 --> 00:26:06.031 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE.

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:06.932 region:rollup2
LIKE I THINK THERE'S AN AREA

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:07.966 region:rollup2
THAT NEARLY OUT OF STUDIES OUT

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:10.002 region:rollup2
THERE THAT HAVE PROVEN THAT

00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:11.103 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE CASE. BUT THE

00:26:10.002 --> 00:26:13.072 region:rollup2
OTHER IDEA OF COST IS THE COST

00:26:11.103 --> 00:26:14.306 region:rollup2
OF ACTUALLY THEIR VESTING THE

00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:15.240 region:rollup2
FUNDS AND THE PROCESS OF DOING

00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:16.708 region:rollup2
MATH AND ROLLING INTO MORE

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.610 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTALLY SOCIALLY

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:20.479 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.480 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AND THE IDEA THERE IS

00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:24.049 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE TYPICAL

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:26.051 region:rollup2
REBALANCING SESSIONS TO FUNDS

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:29.188 region:rollup2
THAT ARE MANAGED SO THERE WOULD

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:30.923 region:rollup2
BE A MORE NATURAL WAYS OVER A

00:26:29.188 --> 00:26:32.257 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS.

00:26:30.923 --> 00:26:33.258 region:rollup2
TO DIVEST FROM CERTAIN POOR

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:34.860 region:rollup2
PERFORMERS AND INVESTING GOOD

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:37.463 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.430 region:rollup2
AND WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF ALL

00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:39.832 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KINDS OF WAYS TO

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.301 region:rollup2
MANAGE IN A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE

00:26:39.832 --> 00:26:43.469 region:rollup2
MANNER NOW THERE'S TONS OF.

00:26:42.301 --> 00:26:44.837 region:rollup2
MASSIVE PRODUCTS OUT THERE

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:46.071 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT ACTIVE PRODUCTS

00:26:44.837 --> 00:26:47.940 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO MANAGE

00:26:46.071 --> 00:26:49.475 region:rollup2
IT BUT IN TYPICAL REBALANCING.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.010 region:rollup2
THE COSTS OF SWITCHING THAT

00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:53.545 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO SHOULD BE FAIRLY.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.414 region:rollup2
BUT BUT STILL THAT THE LONG TERM

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:57.216 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IS MY QUESTION IN AND

00:26:55.414 --> 00:26:58.984 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

00:26:57.216 --> 00:27:01.019 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AYE

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:02.754 region:rollup2
CAL STIRS ON FOR QUITE A NUMBER

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:05.023 region:rollup2
OF YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN ASKING

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:06.859 region:rollup2
FOR FOR EXAMPLE. A GIVEN ALL THE

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:08.227 region:rollup2
CURRENT DIVESTMENT DISCUSSIONS

00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:09.661 region:rollup2
THAT ARE TAKING PLACE NOW THAT

00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:11.330 region:rollup2
HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST

00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:12.865 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE ASKED CAN

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.100 region:rollup2
YOU PUT TOGETHER IF THESE

00:27:12.865 --> 00:27:16.502 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS HAD. TAKEN PLACE A

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.203 region:rollup2
DECADE AGO AND YOU WERE TOLD TO

00:27:16.502 --> 00:27:20.105 region:rollup2
DIVEST WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE

00:27:18.203 --> 00:27:22.374 region:rollup2
COST IMPLICATION WHAT WOULD THE

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:24.142 region:rollup2
RATE OF RETURN HAVE BEEN BECAUSE

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:27.212 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY. IF

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:28.580 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT AND X. Y. OR Z. MEANS

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:30.215 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.084 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVE A SEVEN PERCENT RATE

00:27:30.215 --> 00:27:33.285 region:rollup2
OF RETURN THAT DOES HAVE A

00:27:32.084 --> 00:27:34.453 region:rollup2
DIRECT IMPACT ON THE

00:27:33.285 --> 00:27:36.155 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION RATES THAT

00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:37.356 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS ARE PAIN. THAT ARE NOT

00:27:36.155 --> 00:27:38.957 region:rollup2
ONLY OUR MEMBERS BUT

00:27:37.356 --> 00:27:40.292 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY NEW MEMBERS THAT

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:41.660 region:rollup2
WERE HIRED AFTER TWO THOUSAND

00:27:40.292 --> 00:27:43.362 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN OUR PAIN AND THEN

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.430 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY IN ADDITION BECAUSE

00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:47.666 region:rollup2
OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF AB

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:50.836 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE. THE GENERAL

00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:53.805 region:rollup2
FUND ALSO PAYS FOR THAT SO IN A

00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:55.040 region:rollup2
SENSE YOU'RE TAXING EDUCATORS IN

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:56.975 region:rollup2
YOUR TAX IN THE STATE TO MAKE

00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:00.045 region:rollup2
THAT DECISION WHICH IS WHY WE'VE

00:27:56.975 --> 00:28:00.913 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE A FISCAL DISCUSSION.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:03.482 region:rollup2
SO THAT THERE'S A TRUE

00:28:00.913 --> 00:28:07.452 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THOSE

00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:09.221 region:rollup2
COSTS MAY BE OUT WHICH IS WHY WE

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:10.989 region:rollup2
WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYTIME YOU'RE

00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:14.159 region:rollup2
HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:17.229 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT. TO ENSURE THAT

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:17.963 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ASKING IF THERE WERE TO

00:28:17.229 --> 00:28:19.398 region:rollup2
BE LOSSES

00:28:17.963 --> 00:28:20.299 region:rollup2
WHO WOULD COVER THOSE LOSSES IS

00:28:19.398 --> 00:28:21.433 region:rollup2
GOING TO HELPED US HAVE A BETTER

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:23.001 region:rollup2
SENSE IN IT MAY NOT EVEN BE. A

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:24.303 region:rollup2
MEDIA BUT TO ENSURE THAT YOUR

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:25.437 region:rollup2
CHECKING WITH THE INVESTMENT

00:28:24.303 --> 00:28:26.905 region:rollup2
DIVISIONS OF COUNSELORS AND

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:27.773 region:rollup2
CALPERS AS THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:29.641 region:rollup2
HAPPENING TO KNOW WHAT THE

00:28:27.773 --> 00:28:30.275 region:rollup2
ULTIMATE CONTRIBUTION RATE

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.109 region:rollup2
IMPACT WHICH SHOULD BE THE STATE

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:33.278 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:34.246 region:rollup2
WELL WE HAVE WE HAVE ARGUED FOR

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:34.980 region:rollup2
US WOULD YOU GO YOUR YOU CAN'T

00:28:34.246 --> 00:28:35.747 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ARGUED ARE PER OUR

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.882 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:38.050 region:rollup2
TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IS.

00:28:36.882 --> 00:28:38.517 region:rollup2
WE WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.618 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT DOES IF THE

00:28:38.517 --> 00:28:40.052 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WOULD INDEMNIFY THE

00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:41.820 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

00:28:40.052 --> 00:28:43.589 region:rollup2
BUT DOT CONVERSATION HASN'T HAS

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.923 region:rollup2
NOT ALWAYS MOVED THE DIRECTION

00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:46.525 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD LIKE.

00:28:44.923 --> 00:28:48.193 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE IF THERE IS A

00:28:46.525 --> 00:28:48.660 region:rollup2
REALIZATION THAT THERE'S A COSTS

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:50.095 region:rollup2
AND.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.296 region:rollup2
AND THE GENERAL FUND WOULD PICK

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:53.031 region:rollup2
IT UP THAT'S A DIFFERENT

00:28:51.296 --> 00:28:55.667 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BUT SOME OF THESE

00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:57.703 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE WELL I

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:59.671 region:rollup2
HOPE AS WE AS WE MAY SEE MORE

00:28:57.703 --> 00:29:00.973 region:rollup2
THESE BILLS WILL SEE. THIS YEAR

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:02.307 region:rollup2
THAT THAT CONVERSATION IS HEAD

00:29:00.973 --> 00:29:04.743 region:rollup2
OF THE TABLE AT THE AT THE

00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:07.112 region:rollup2
HEARING LEVEL. IN EVEN EVEN ON

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:07.946 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET SIDE AS TO HOW.

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:09.114 region:rollup2
THESE YOU KNOW THESE BILLS ARE

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:09.948 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE PAID FOR

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.582 region:rollup2
THE STATUTES ARE GOING TO BE

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:12.251 region:rollup2
PAID FOR.

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:15.487 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:17.055 region:rollup2
BUT COOLEY.

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:18.757 region:rollup2
I'M OR JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:20.359 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL TOPIC A LITTLE BIT.

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:21.927 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:23.128 region:rollup2
HEARING I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF

00:29:21.927 --> 00:29:25.464 region:rollup2
OPENING THIS SUBJECT MATTER.

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:26.965 region:rollup2
ARM.

00:29:25.464 --> 00:29:29.001 region:rollup2
BUT INTELLECTUALLY I FEEL IT'S

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:30.369 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST A START.

00:29:29.001 --> 00:29:31.870 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE PICTURE COMES TO

00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:32.638 region:rollup2
MIND TO ME IS YOU KNOW. YOU'RE

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.005 region:rollup2
WEARING THAT SWEATER AND HASN'T

00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:34.439 region:rollup2
LOSE

00:29:33.005 --> 00:29:37.309 region:rollup2
LOSE.

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:38.477 region:rollup2
BETTER.

00:29:37.309 --> 00:29:40.612 region:rollup2
THREAT ON NEW GRABBED IT JUST

00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:41.713 region:rollup2
KEEPS COMING.

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:44.716 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS A PART OF MUCH

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:46.284 region:rollup2
LARGER WHOLE.

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:47.419 region:rollup2
ARE VOTERS A COURSE IN JUNE OF

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:49.154 region:rollup2

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:10.575 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO RECKON WITH

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:13.679 region:rollup2
THAT FACT IN OUR STATE

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:14.813 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION.

JURY DUTY IS ABOUT PRUDENCE.

00:30:16.782 --> 00:30:20.218 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR

00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:21.153 region:rollup2
BALLOT PROPOSITION IT WAS NOT

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:23.322 region:rollup2
SIMPLY THE CRUDENESS OF ORDINARY

00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:24.156 region:rollup2
INVESTOR.

00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:25.590 region:rollup2

00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:39.471 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:40.372 region:rollup2
THAT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED

00:30:39.471 --> 00:30:41.940 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY SINCE NINETEEN

00:30:40.372 --> 00:30:43.208 region:rollup2

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.510 region:rollup2
S. ESCALATES THE COMPLEXITY OF

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:47.679 region:rollup2
THIS PAST.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.381 region:rollup2
THE NATURE OF SYSTEMIC RISK IN

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:51.750 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMY THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

00:30:49.381 --> 00:30:53.051 region:rollup2

THE MARKER FOR THIS PIECE THE

00:30:55.287 --> 00:30:58.423 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

00:30:56.421 --> 00:31:00.792 region:rollup2
A GREAT RISE IN SPECIALIZED

00:30:58.423 --> 00:31:03.161 region:rollup2
SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BRING.

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:03.962 region:rollup2
BRING SKILL SETS

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:05.330 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WISH TO MARKET A

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:06.965 region:rollup2
PENSION FUNDS TO ASSIST THEM.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.367 region:rollup2
PENSION FUNDS IN THEIR WORK BUT

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:10.335 region:rollup2
NONE THE LESS IT IS THE JOB OF

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:12.671 region:rollup2
THE PENSION FUNDS.

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:13.238 region:rollup2
TO EXERCISE OWN DISCRETION IN

00:31:12.671 --> 00:31:14.806 region:rollup2
THE WHO ARE THE EXPERTS SAY

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:16.007 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:17.142 region:rollup2
AND COURSE THE GREAT RULE OF

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:20.011 region:rollup2
EXPERTS IS EXPERTS SHOULD BE ON

00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:21.880 region:rollup2
TAP BUT NEVER ON TOP.

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:23.148 region:rollup2
SO ONCEAGAIN WE'RE LEFT WITH

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.849 region:rollup2
THE PENSION SYSTEMS AS HE SOLIS

00:31:23.148 --> 00:31:26.318 region:rollup2

00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:30.555 region:rollup2
AND THEN MORE GLOBALLY.

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:31.356 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC DRAMATIC INCREASES THE

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:33.625 region:rollup2

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:36.895 region:rollup2
CONFRONTING THESE ENTERPRISES

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:39.765 region:rollup2
GLOBALLY IN OUR INVESTMENT

00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:40.999 region:rollup2
PROTOCOL.

00:31:39.765 --> 00:31:42.534 region:rollup2
SO HONESTLY I THINK IS THE

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:44.469 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THIS WHERE MY THREAD

00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:46.538 region:rollup2
STARTS COMING UNDONE.

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.672 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS

00:31:46.538 --> 00:31:49.074 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSE ALLEGED TO SUPPORT

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:50.108 region:rollup2
PENSION SYSTEMS.

00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:51.610 region:rollup2
CALPERS CALPERS THE COUNTY

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:53.879 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.380 region:rollup2
OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:58.450 region:rollup2
IT OUGHTA BE MAKING SURE THAT

00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:00.018 region:rollup2

OUR FREED UP TO INVESTED

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:02.454 region:rollup2
INTELLECTUAL LABOR THAT IS

00:32:00.719 --> 00:32:03.755 region:rollup2
REQUIRED.

00:32:02.454 --> 00:32:06.658 region:rollup2
TOO MAKE SURE THEY'RE INVESTMENT

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:07.125 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES ARE WELL ADAPTED.

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:09.060 region:rollup2
THE GLOBAL INVESTMENT

ENVIRONMENT.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.698 region:rollup2
SO I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THE

00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:15.100 region:rollup2
THIS APPEAL THAT WE WE.

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:17.569 region:rollup2

THIS WINTER FOR SOME PURPOSE.

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:26.978 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE NOT JUST BILLS

00:32:25.577 --> 00:32:29.114 region:rollup2
ENUNCIATED POLICY THOSE ARE

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:30.348 region:rollup2
BILLS INVITED AN OPPORTUNITY

COST ON THE PENSION FUNDS TO

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:33.218 region:rollup2
DIVERT THEIR INTELLECTUAL

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:34.753 region:rollup2
ASSETS.

00:32:33.218 --> 00:32:36.121 region:rollup2
FROM THESE GLOBAL THINGS INTO

00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:36.855 region:rollup2
VITAL FOR THEM TO ADDRESS IS A

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:37.856 region:rollup2
PART OF THEIR FUTURE

00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:39.958 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:32:37.856 --> 00:32:41.593 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:43.295 region:rollup2
AND AND TO GET DOWN THE WEEDS OF

OR SMALLER THINGS WHICH A

00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:47.098 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY OF IN FARM.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.733 region:rollup2
WHEN I ACTUALLY THINK THE GAME

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:49.734 region:rollup2
IS ELSEWHERE EVER PENSION FUNDS

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:52.070 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA BE WELL ADMINISTERED.

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:56.141 region:rollup2
AND.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:57.676 region:rollup2
AS I SAY YOU KNOW THIS.

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:59.878 region:rollup2
COULDN'T STUDIO WHICH IS A PART

00:32:57.676 --> 00:33:00.445 region:rollup2
OF THE DUTY OF A FIDUCIARY DUTY

00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:02.481 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:33:00.445 --> 00:33:04.249 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:06.718 region:rollup2
THE FIDUCIARY DUTY ALSO INCLUDES

00:33:04.249 --> 00:33:07.919 region:rollup2
THE DUTY OF LOYALTY.

00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:09.321 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS YOU WILL NOT GET

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:11.756 region:rollup2
YOURSELF DIVERTED FROM FOCUSING

00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:12.257 region:rollup2
ON THE BEEN FISHERIES.

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:13.892 region:rollup2
AND THAT OUGHT TO BE HAD

00:33:12.257 --> 00:33:15.927 region:rollup2
MONITORING THE LEGISLATURE THAT

00:33:13.892 --> 00:33:18.597 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A DUTY OF LOYALTY.

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:19.431 region:rollup2
ALSO IMPARTIALITY.

00:33:18.597 --> 00:33:22.033 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD CONDUCT THEIR

WORK AS A FIDUCIARY IMPARTIAL.

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:25.170 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THE RESULT WHICH THEY

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:27.873 region:rollup2
ARE CHARGED WITH.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.440 region:rollup2
AND I JUST FEEL THAT THE.

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:31.109 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL TIME

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.512 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:34.412 region:rollup2
ARE PENSION SYSTEMS.

00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:35.981 region:rollup2
IT IS A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:37.749 region:rollup2
ACTUAL QUESTION HOW DO WE GIVE

00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:39.684 region:rollup2
THOUGHT LEADERSHIP ON HOW TO.

OPERATE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:43.822 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY CRITICAL.

00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:44.556 region:rollup2
AND NOT JUST FOR THE BOTTOM LINE

00:33:43.822 --> 00:33:47.459 region:rollup2
OF THESE PENSION FUNDS FOR OUR

00:33:44.556 --> 00:33:48.360 region:rollup2

I ASSETS TO PAY BENEFITS COME

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:43.254 region:rollup2
FROM TWO SOURCES

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.323 region:rollup2
AND THOSE TWO SOURCES ARE

00:43:43.254 --> 00:43:46.991 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THAT SYSTEM

00:43:45.323 --> 00:43:48.826 region:rollup2

SO I'M WHEN ACTUAR A SIGNAL LOOK

00:43:56.334 --> 00:44:02.006 region:rollup2
AT WHAT THE ARM GOT AVAILABLE

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:03.608 region:rollup2
ASSETS ARE GOING TO BE WHAT THEY

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:05.142 region:rollup2

IS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED THAT

00:44:15.553 --> 00:44:18.990 region:rollup2
MEANS CONTRIBUTION CAN BE LOWER

00:44:17.722 --> 00:44:20.658 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND IF INVESTMENTS

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:23.294 region:rollup2
ARE LOWER THAN EXPECTED. THAT

00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:26.230 region:rollup2
MEANS CONTRIUTIONS HALF TO BE

00:44:23.294 --> 00:44:28.299 region:rollup2
HIRED SINCE.

00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:16.847 region:rollup2
THE. GOAL OF ANY RETIREMENT

00:45:14.345 --> 00:45:18.416 region:rollup2

00:49:07.578 --> 00:49:10.448 region:rollup2
INVESTING WITH OUT HAVING AN

00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:12.016 region:rollup2
ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE DISCOUNT

00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:15.452 region:rollup2
RATE THAT.

00:49:12.016 --> 00:49:17.955 region:rollup2
AND SO I WILL ADD.

00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:19.957 region:rollup2
JUST MAKE ONE MINOR CORRECTION

00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:21.425 region:rollup2
TO THE TO THE STATEMENT THAT WAS

00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:23.327 region:rollup2
MADE IN THE FIRST PANEL. YOU

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:25.029 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT LOOK AT WHETHER THIS

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:27.498 region:rollup2
HAS AN IMPACT.

00:49:25.029 --> 00:49:29.567 region:rollup2
BOB RELATIVE TO THE SEVEN

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:31.902 region:rollup2
PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE IF THE

00:49:29.567 --> 00:49:34.338 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT RETURN WILL BE LOWER

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:36.240 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS A COST ASSOCIATED

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:37.942 region:rollup2
WITH DOING MASS.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.644 region:rollup2
BUT MADISON COST THE TAXPAYERS

00:49:37.942 --> 00:49:42.246 region:rollup2
MUST BEAR THAT'S INDEPENDENT OF

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.914 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE INVEST FOR RETURN IS

00:49:42.246 --> 00:49:46.083 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OR WHETHER THE

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:49.620 region:rollup2
INVEST FOR RETURNS FIFTEEN

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:50.888 region:rollup2
PERCENT. AND SO MY MY COMMENT IS

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:54.158 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN DO IT

00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:55.693 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A COST.

00:49:54.158 --> 00:50:00.798 region:rollup2
BUT BUT AGAIN PLEASE REMEMBER MY

00:49:55.693 --> 00:50:04.435 region:rollup2
CAPITA.

00:50:00.798 --> 00:50:05.836 region:rollup2
AS AN ACTUARY SO YOUNG.

00:50:04.435 --> 00:50:07.371 region:rollup2
THE BOARD HAS SAID SEXUALLY

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:08.372 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT GOALS RIGHT WE'VE

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:10.508 region:rollup2
LOWERED DOWN TO SUFFERS AS A

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:11.675 region:rollup2
DISCOUNT RATE.

00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:12.376 region:rollup2
IT IS SO IS YOUR DOING ACTUARY

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:14.512 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS

00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:16.514 region:rollup2
YOU JUST TAKE THAT.

00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:18.883 region:rollup2
GOAL OR DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION

00:50:16.514 --> 00:50:19.483 region:rollup2
LIKE WELL ACTUALLY THE AND AND

00:50:18.883 --> 00:50:21.819 region:rollup2
IT'S THIS CHALLENGING BECAUSE

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:23.187 region:rollup2
RETURNS OF COURSE CHANGE EVERY

00:50:21.819 --> 00:50:24.588 region:rollup2
YEAR WERE KINDA LOOKING LONG

00:50:23.187 --> 00:50:25.222 region:rollup2
TERM I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:26.924 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT FOLKS ARE LOOKING AT

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:28.325 region:rollup2
WE.

00:50:26.924 --> 00:50:28.659 region:rollup2
WELL THAT PENSION FUNDS ARE IN

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:30.761 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM.

00:50:28.659 --> 00:50:31.996 region:rollup2
.

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:33.063 region:rollup2
AND IT CERTAINLY ANY TIME WHICH

00:50:31.996 --> 00:50:33.931 region:rollup2
IS A DISCOVERY HAS SIGNIFICANT

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:35.332 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES.

00:50:33.931 --> 00:50:38.202 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS AND SO FORTH.

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:40.938 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON.

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:42.273 region:rollup2
THE SETTING OF THE DISCOUNT RATE

00:50:40.938 --> 00:50:44.174 region:rollup2
BOB. BACH I'LL GIVE YOU COUPLE

00:50:42.273 --> 00:50:45.709 region:rollup2
OF COMMENTS AS QUICKLY AS

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:47.211 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE COMMENT NUMBER ONE IS I

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:49.880 region:rollup2
THINK IT SHOULD BE AS

00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:52.416 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.918 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO.

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:55.119 region:rollup2
AYE IVAN.

00:50:53.918 --> 00:50:55.119 region:rollup2
BUT DOING ACTUAR WORK FOR A LONG

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:57.888 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:50:57.955 --> 00:51:03.627 region:rollup2
DISCOVERED IS. BAD NEWS ALWAYS

00:51:00.858 --> 00:51:04.161 region:rollup2
HURTS MORE THAN GOOD NEWS IF YOU

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:05.229 region:rollup2
PUT THOSE TWO ON A TEETER

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:07.398 region:rollup2
TOTTER.

00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:12.903 region:rollup2
BAD NWS WAYS MORE PHIL I AM A

00:51:07.398 --> 00:51:14.104 region:rollup2
FAN OF HAVING A SMALL MARGIN FOR

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:16.507 region:rollup2
I REFER TO IT AS KIND OF A

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:19.843 region:rollup2
MARGIN FOR ADVERSE DEVIATION SO.

00:51:16.507 --> 00:51:20.477 region:rollup2
MARGIN FOR BAD NEWS IF YOU WELL

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:22.713 region:rollup2
FELLOW.

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:24.748 region:rollup2
WIDE PERSONALLY OF LOOKED AT

00:51:22.713 --> 00:51:28.619 region:rollup2
CALPERS DEVELOPMENT OF THE

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:31.855 region:rollup2
DISCOUNT RATE WE ARE FIRM. DOES

00:51:28.619 --> 00:51:33.223 region:rollup2
NOT IN ANY WORK WE DO WE DON'T

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:35.593 region:rollup2
PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT CALPERS

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:40.597 region:rollup2
DOES BUT IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY

00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:42.232 region:rollup2
INFLECTED DISCOUNT RATE UP ON ON

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:43.367 region:rollup2
ON ON OUR SHELF.

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:46.470 region:rollup2
A.

00:51:43.367 --> 00:51:48.205 region:rollup2
I M. A LITTLE NERVOUS ARM. THAT

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.974 region:rollup2
WHAT CALPERS HAS DONE IN

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:53.844 region:rollup2
SELECTING THE DISCOUNT RATE IS

00:51:49.974 --> 00:51:56.046 region:rollup2
RELY A LOT ON. ANTICIPATED

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:58.382 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT RETURN BEYOND THE

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:58.816 region:rollup2
NEXT DECADE SO A INVESTMENT

00:51:58.382 --> 00:52:00.484 region:rollup2
ADVISORS.

00:51:58.816 --> 00:52:03.654 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:06.056 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY RELUCTANT TO LOOK AT

00:52:03.654 --> 00:52:07.624 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT RETURN BEYOND THE

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:09.893 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:11.495 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ALL GIVE. AND EXPECTED

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:13.597 region:rollup2

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:15.933 region:rollup2

THAT AND SAY WELL.

00:52:15.933 --> 00:52:18.102 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE NOT

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:19.637 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO BE AROUND FOR THE

00:52:18.102 --> 00:52:22.206 region:rollup2
NEXT DECADE WERE EXPECTED TO BE

00:52:19.637 --> 00:52:24.775 region:rollup2
AROUND FOR THE NEXT.

00:52:22.206 --> 00:52:25.909 region:rollup2
WHEN THIRTY FIFTY A HUNDRED

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:27.544 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:52:25.909 --> 00:52:29.113 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S THEIR JOB TO TAKE

00:52:27.544 --> 00:52:30.948 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION AND ANTICIPATE

00:52:29.113 --> 00:52:31.615 region:rollup2
WHAT THE RETURNS ARE GOING TO BE

00:52:30.948 --> 00:52:33.050 region:rollup2
NOT JUST IN THE NEXT DECADE

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:34.551 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT.

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:37.021 region:rollup2
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED THAT

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:41.458 region:rollup2
CALPERS IS BEING.

00:52:37.021 --> 00:52:43.827 region:rollup2
IT IS RELYING AYE TOO MUCH ON.

00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:48.532 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATION THAT MARKETS WILL

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:51.201 region:rollup2
RETURN TO HIS. AVERAGES WHICH

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:53.370 region:rollup2
GETS TO WALK HIGHER ANTICIPATED

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:55.272 region:rollup2
RETURN YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THAT

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.806 region:rollup2
IN WHAT THE INVESTMENT ADVISORS

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:57.675 region:rollup2

NEXT DECADE CALPERS OF USING SAP

00:53:01.979 --> 00:53:04.815 region:rollup2

TO MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE. I'M

00:53:09.987 --> 00:53:14.258 region:rollup2
I'M JUST PERSONALLY WORRIED.

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:17.795 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS.

00:53:14.258 --> 00:53:18.395 region:rollup2

MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE IN THE

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:24.935 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF FULL DISCLOSURE BUT

00:53:22.633 --> 00:53:26.937 region:rollup2
MOST OF MY CLIENTS WANT THE

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:28.338 region:rollup2
DISCOUNT RATE TO BE AS HIGH AS

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:30.074 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE SO THEY CAN FIT INTO

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:32.009 region:rollup2
THEIR BUDGETS.

00:53:30.074 --> 00:53:33.277 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THE JOB AN ACTUARY IS

00:53:32.009 --> 00:53:39.216 region:rollup2

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.658 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO REASONS IN

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:28.959 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR THAT I WANNA

00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:30.894 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT TODAY.

00:55:28.959 --> 00:55:32.563 region:rollup2
FOR WHY WE FAVOR ENGAGEMENT OVER

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:33.864 region:rollup2
MANDATED DIVESTMENT.

00:55:32.563 --> 00:55:35.632 region:rollup2
IN THE FIRST IS THAT WE BELIEVE

00:55:33.864 --> 00:55:37.167 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:39.570 region:rollup2
OUR PENSION FUNDS MUST BE

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:41.205 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZED OVER.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.606 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT MANDATES THAT MIGHT

00:55:41.205 --> 00:55:44.174 region:rollup2
HAMPER WITH THE ABILITY FOR THE

00:55:42.606 --> 00:55:45.742 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS TO MAXIMIZE RISK

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:48.078 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED RETURNS

00:55:45.742 --> 00:55:49.513 region:rollup2
AND RISK ADJUSTED IN OUR VIEW IS

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:50.347 region:rollup2
A REALLY KEY PHRASE HERE.

00:55:49.513 --> 00:55:51.682 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DOES MEAN THAT WE

00:55:50.347 --> 00:55:52.850 region:rollup2
SHOULD JUST INVEST IN EVERYTHING

00:55:51.682 --> 00:55:55.519 region:rollup2
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WILL MAKE THE

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:57.354 region:rollup2
MOST MONEY I'M OF COURSE NOT A

00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:57.854 region:rollup2
AS THE FIRST PANEL DESCRIBERS

00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.423 region:rollup2
ALWAYS GOING TO BE RISKS

00:55:57.854 --> 00:56:00.424 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:02.659 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT ABOUT

00:56:00.424 --> 00:56:03.861 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S JUST THAT OUR OPINION

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:05.796 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE PEOPLE MOST

00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:07.698 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED TO MAKE THOSE RISK

00:56:05.796 --> 00:56:08.498 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENT ADJUSTED DECISIONS

00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:09.967 region:rollup2
ARE THE FOLKS THAT SIT IN THE

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:11.401 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS THAT CALTRANS AND

00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:13.203 region:rollup2
CALPERS. AND THE VARIOUS

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:15.739 region:rollup2
CONSULTANTS AND CAN BY ADVISERS

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:17.641 region:rollup2
THAT THEY USE NOT NECESSARILY ON

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:19.476 region:rollup2
THE ONE OFF INVESTMENT MANDATES

00:56:17.641 --> 00:56:20.844 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEE FROM YEAR TO YEAR.

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:22.212 region:rollup2
IN FACT IT'S THOSE MANDATES THAT

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:23.413 region:rollup2
OF COST THE CALPERS SYSTEM IN

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:25.883 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:27.117 region:rollup2
OVER EIGHT OR EIGHT POINT FIVE

00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:28.185 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN COUNTING

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:29.286 region:rollup2
NOW SCHOOL EMPLOYERS REPRESENT

00:56:28.185 --> 00:56:30.687 region:rollup2
ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE

00:56:29.286 --> 00:56:31.989 region:rollup2
CALPERS SYSTEM IN TERMS OF

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:33.924 region:rollup2
MEMBERSHIP SO THAT'S A REALLY

00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:35.058 region:rollup2
BIG NUMBER FOR US.

00:56:33.924 --> 00:56:36.994 region:rollup2
I'M IN AS EMPLOYERS THIS MEAN

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:38.795 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COSTS

00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:40.264 region:rollup2
FOR OUR EMPLOYEES IT REALLY

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:42.566 region:rollup2
EXPANDS ON THE QUESTION MARK

00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:44.001 region:rollup2
AROUND RETIREMENT SECURITY.

00:56:42.566 --> 00:56:45.135 region:rollup2
SO ULTIMATELY WE IN THE

00:56:44.001 --> 00:56:46.603 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY NEED FOR

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:48.238 region:rollup2
FROM A COUPLE OF US TODAY WERE

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:49.806 region:rollup2
ALL IN THE SAME BOAT WHETHER

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:52.142 region:rollup2
YOUR EMPLOYERAND EMPLOYEE.

00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:53.477 region:rollup2
APPARENT OR RETIRE RE THE GOAL

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:54.645 region:rollup2
AROUND STAYS DISCUSSION IN OUR

00:56:53.477 --> 00:56:56.380 region:rollup2
VIEW SHOULD REALLY BE ABOUT THE

00:56:54.645 --> 00:56:58.515 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF RETIREMENT SECURITY

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.883 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER DIVESTMENT MANDATES

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:02.052 region:rollup2
ON A ONE OFF BASIS.

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:03.186 region:rollup2
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

00:57:02.052 --> 00:57:04.688 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THAT FOR EMPLOYEES

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:05.555 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AGAIN IT ALL GOES BACK

00:57:04.688 --> 00:57:06.790 region:rollup2
TO OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:08.992 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:10.928 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE.

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:11.795 region:rollup2
NOW I KNOW THAT I'M THE FIFTH

00:57:10.928 --> 00:57:14.064 region:rollup2
PANEL THE PARTICULARS GONNA

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:15.699 region:rollup2
REALLY I TOUCH ON THIS ISSUE SO

00:57:14.064 --> 00:57:17.267 region:rollup2
I'M ONLY GOING TO MENTION IT A

00:57:15.699 --> 00:57:18.869 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT WHEN WE LEAVE THE

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:20.604 region:rollup2
TABLE WE WHO HAVE THOSE

00:57:18.869 --> 00:57:22.539 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VALUES WHEN WE SELL

00:57:20.604 --> 00:57:24.641 region:rollup2
THOSE SHARES. WERE OFTEN SELLING

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:26.476 region:rollup2
IT TOO INVESTORS WHO ARE.

00:57:24.641 --> 00:57:28.312 region:rollup2
MAYBE AGNOSTIC TO THOSE

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:29.913 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VALUES AND THAT'S A

00:57:28.312 --> 00:57:31.548 region:rollup2
BIG CONCERN FOR US BECAUSE WE

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:33.016 region:rollup2
SHARE THOSE VALUES AS WELL AND

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:35.152 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD MUCH RATHER SEE THE

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:36.720 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FOCUS ON. HELPING

00:57:35.152 --> 00:57:38.322 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEMS MAXIMIZE THOSE RISK

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.923 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED RETURNS

00:57:38.322 --> 00:57:41.725 region:rollup2
SO TO CONCLUDE DIVESTMENT

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:43.427 region:rollup2
MANDATES HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON

00:57:41.725 --> 00:57:45.162 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYERS

00:57:43.427 --> 00:57:47.197 region:rollup2
TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE BEST

00:57:45.162 --> 00:57:48.765 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS. AND ALSO IMPACTS OUR

00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:50.467 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:51.435 region:rollup2
SERVICES WHEN WE PAY TO MAKE UP

00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:52.669 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE ON THOSE

00:57:51.435 --> 00:57:53.937 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT LOSSES THAT I

00:57:52.669 --> 00:57:55.105 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER. SO I REALLY

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:56.606 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO

00:57:55.105 --> 00:57:58.075 region:rollup2
CONSIDER A POLICY THAT WILL

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:59.476 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY REPLACE THOSE ONE OFF

00:57:58.075 --> 00:58:01.078 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT MANDATE MEASURES

00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:02.412 region:rollup2
WITH AN APPROACH THAT WEIGHS THE

00:58:01.078 --> 00:58:04.014 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY COSTS AND KEEPS IN

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:04.948 region:rollup2
MIND THE IMPACT. A CALIFORNIA'S

00:58:04.014 --> 00:58:07.617 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:09.353 region:rollup2

IT'S BEFORE.

00:58:11.188 --> 00:58:15.258 region:rollup2

ALL OF US WERE LATE.

00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:24.901 region:rollup2

WE HOLD THESE FUNDS IN TRUST FOR

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:36.980 region:rollup2
PROMISES THAT WERE MADE THAT WE

00:58:35.212 --> 00:58:38.415 region:rollup2
HAVE A PUBLIC POLICY VERY POOR

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.517 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY REASON FOR

00:58:38.415 --> 00:58:42.919 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING. THE PUBLIC TRUST IN

BE ABLE TO KNOWLEDGE COURTS UP

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:50.961 region:rollup2
TO RECRUIT BUT ALSO A IF THE

RETIREES THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE A

00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:55.632 region:rollup2
SOLID. SECURE RETIREMENT.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:57.768 region:rollup2
THAT SHE BECOMES A FUTURE COSTS

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:58.969 region:rollup2
FOR US IN STATE GOVERNMENT WE

00:58:57.768 --> 00:59:00.037 region:rollup2
ARE FINE WE WILL BE FINE

00:58:58.969 --> 00:59:02.239 region:rollup2
YOURSELVES DEALING.

00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:02.773 region:rollup2
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:59:02.239 --> 00:59:04.007 region:rollup2
POVERTY AND OTHER TYPES OF

00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:06.309 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:08.044 region:rollup2
WHEN AT AT AND FRANKLY MOST OF

00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:10.480 region:rollup2
THE PENSIONS THEMSELVES

THE CIRCUIT PEOPLE ABOVE WATER%

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.283 region:rollup2
NOT THEIR NET NET IS NOT BIG

00:59:12.015 --> 00:59:14.384 region:rollup2
PAYDAY IT'S VERY MODEST SO. THAT

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:16.620 region:rollup2
IT DOES SERVE A VERY IMPORTANT

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:20.557 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY GOAL WITH AID

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:21.091 region:rollup2
TENET COST IRWIN IF IF WE DON'T

00:59:20.557 --> 00:59:22.192 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN STABILITY IN OUR

00:59:21.091 --> 00:59:23.627 region:rollup2
PENSIONS IS

00:59:22.192 --> 00:59:24.895 region:rollup2
AS WELL IN THAT. COST WILL BE

00:59:23.627 --> 00:59:25.796 region:rollup2
BORNE BY TAXPAYERS SO WOULD YOU

00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:26.997 region:rollup2
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE TAXPAYER

00:59:25.796 --> 00:59:28.298 region:rollup2
COST FOR THE PENSION THE LET'S

00:59:26.997 --> 00:59:30.267 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE TAXPAYER COST.

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:32.302 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE AS WELL FOR ARE THE

00:59:30.267 --> 00:59:33.737 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF OF OF OF HAVING

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:35.338 region:rollup2
OURS STATE EMPLOYEES ARE

00:59:33.737 --> 00:59:36.673 region:rollup2
TEACHERS THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:38.308 region:rollup2
COVERED BY THESE PENSIONS ARE.

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:40.377 region:rollup2
NOW HAVING TO BE ON THE PUBLIC

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:41.311 region:rollup2
DOLE POTENTIALLY SELL.

00:59:40.377 --> 00:59:44.147 region:rollup2
SHE DIED.

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:45.248 region:rollup2
DO QUESTIONS FOR PANELISTS.

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:47.117 region:rollup2
BUT

00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:48.718 region:rollup2
AS OUR LEYVA.

00:59:47.117 --> 00:59:50.086 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST OF MAKE A COMMENT

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:51.888 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW I I TO WORRY ABOUT

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:52.956 region:rollup2
THE DIVESTMENT.

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:55.425 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK OUR FIRST

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:57.360 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION IS TO THE PENSIONERS

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:59.529 region:rollup2
THE RETIREES ARE WHILE WE ALWAYS

00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.263 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF PEOPLE

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:01.531 region:rollup2
THAT ARE.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:03.033 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TOBACCO OR WHATEVER

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.667 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THAT WE CHOOSE AT THE

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:04.901 region:rollup2
TIME THAT.

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:05.969 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T LIKE TO BE

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:08.872 region:rollup2
AFFILIATED WITH

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:10.006 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DIVEST FROM ONE COMPANY.

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:11.508 region:rollup2
I JUST THINK WE SHOULD ALWAYS

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:13.710 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEONE ELSE THAT WE'RE

01:00:11.508 --> 01:00:14.778 region:rollup2
GOING TO INVEST IN OR WIND UP

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.580 region:rollup2
HURTING THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:18.548 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PROTECT AND TO CENTER

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.484 region:rollup2
PANTS POINT. IT WILL COST US IN

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:21.084 region:rollup2
THE LONG RUN SO APPRECIATE YOUR

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:23.053 region:rollup2

NUMBER BUT WHAT MOST OF

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:34.544 region:rollup2

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.797 region:rollup2
REFRAINED RISK MANAGEMENT AND

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:29.666 region:rollup2
HOW WE THINK ABOUT THAT IN THIS

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:30.200 region:rollup2
BUSINESS NEWS SO RELEVANT OF

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:31.468 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.169 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:34.971 region:rollup2
WE KIND OF YOURSELVES A CALPERS

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:35.839 region:rollup2

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:46.383 region:rollup2
COME HERE WITH YOU.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:48.051 region:rollup2
WE'RE STATE AGENCY WE'VE GOT

PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES IN OUR IN

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:51.821 region:rollup2
OUR MIDST EVERY DAY AND WE'VE

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:52.856 region:rollup2
GOT TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:53.490 region:rollup2
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUMP

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:55.358 region:rollup2
CARD IN THIS IS BEING THE TRUST

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:57.293 region:rollup2
FUND.

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:59.329 region:rollup2
AND BEING THE FIDUCIARY AS IT

01:04:57.293 --> 01:05:00.597 region:rollup2
MIXES WITH THOSE OTHER ISSUES.

UNFORTUNATE FINANCIAL SERVICES

01:05:13.977 --> 01:05:15.745 region:rollup2
SINCE THE RECESSION IS THE

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:17.614 region:rollup2

SECTORS AND I THINK THAT PART OF

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:24.454 region:rollup2
IT IS THE ISSUE YOU'RE TALKING

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:26.356 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT

01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:28.391 region:rollup2
WALLSTREET OPERATES WITH LITTLE

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:29.893 region:rollup2

WHAT WE DO.

01:05:29.893 --> 01:05:33.563 region:rollup2

HOW IT FRAMES ARE BUSINESS.

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.963 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:08.498 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE FACTORS IN THE

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:10.133 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT PROCESS FOR EVERY

01:06:08.498 --> 01:06:11.401 region:rollup2
ASSET CLASS.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:12.769 region:rollup2
HAS THE POTENTIAL OVER THE LONG

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:14.504 region:rollup2
TERM.

01:06:12.769 --> 01:06:16.272 region:rollup2
A POSITIVELY IMPACT INVESTMENT

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:17.707 region:rollup2
RETURNS SO RATHER THAN PUSHING

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:19.209 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM THIS ISSUE THAT WE'RE

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:19.809 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT I WANNA MAKE SURE

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:21.678 region:rollup2
YOU HEAR THAT WERE FOOT BRACE

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:22.979 region:rollup2
THE.

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:24.247 region:rollup2
AND CHRIS WILL TALK IN DETAIL

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:25.381 region:rollup2
HOUSE EMBRACED INVESTMENT

01:06:24.247 --> 01:06:27.250 region:rollup2
STRATEGY BUT THIS IS AN OF

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:28.418 region:rollup2
RUNNING FROM THE ISSUE.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.553 region:rollup2
IT'S EMBRACING IT TO SEE HOW THE

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.120 region:rollup2
RISK MANAGEMENT.

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:32.856 region:rollup2
THIS CAN IMPROVE WHAT WE'RE

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.257 region:rollup2
DOING.

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:35.792 region:rollup2
SO IT'S THE INTEGRATION OF THAT

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:37.994 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT BELIEF THAT THE

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:39.162 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE FORECASTERS.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.597 region:rollup2

DIVESTMENT RELATIVE TO OIL AND

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:47.837 region:rollup2
GAS THAT THAT BRINGS EVERYONE

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:49.272 region:rollup2
INTO THE CONVERSATION. I WANNA

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:51.508 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE YOU THINK OF ANY

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:52.876 region:rollup2
BUSINESS THE WATER BOTTLES WHAT

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:54.344 region:rollup2
HAPPENS THOSE WATER BOTTLES

01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:56.279 region:rollup2
AFTER WE DRINK OF THE CLOTHING

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:58.114 region:rollup2
WE WEAR HOUSE THE WATER MANAGE

01:06:56.279 --> 01:06:59.916 region:rollup2
THE GOT INTO THIS CLOTHING. WHO

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:01.684 region:rollup2
SOURCE THIS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY

01:06:59.916 --> 01:07:03.086 region:rollup2
IN CHILD LABOR?

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.953 region:rollup2
BOARDS ARE THEY DIVERSE OR DO

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:05.588 region:rollup2
THEY REFLECT A MALE DOMINATED

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:08.124 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:10.193 region:rollup2
YOU THINK OF ANY INDUSTRY AND

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:11.494 region:rollup2

CANNOT DIVEST AWAY FROM.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:15.565 region:rollup2
WHOLE MARKET.

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:17.567 region:rollup2
IT PERVADES ALL INDUSTRIES IN

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:19.602 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO CLOSING COMMENT IS

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:21.704 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING I CANNOT SAY ANY AYE

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:23.573 region:rollup2

US ON THE RIGHT TRACK THE

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:30.413 region:rollup2
FUNDING PLAN IS ON TRACK.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:32.448 region:rollup2
BUT WE MUST CAREFULLY PROTECT

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:33.950 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING PLAN AND WHAT WE DO

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:36.185 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER TO YOU IN

ANALYSIS OF THAT FUNDING PLAN.

01:07:37.754 --> 01:07:40.557 region:rollup2
TELL YOU WHERE WE ARE WITH IT

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:42.058 region:rollup2

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:48.631 region:rollup2
RISKS AROUND THIS.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.198 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU ONE NUMBER

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:50.900 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD WORRY ALL OF US

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.536 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS IF WE MAKE THE WRONG

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:55.605 region:rollup2
DECISIONS HERE THE WRONG

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:57.974 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES AND MOVE WE IMPACT

ASSUMPTIONS.

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:08.117 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE A FISCAL IMPACT

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:10.153 region:rollup2
OF EIGHTEEN PLUS BILLION DOLLARS

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:12.055 region:rollup2
OVER THIRTY YEARS.

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:13.556 region:rollup2
STATE TO SCHOOLS EXCEPT FOR

01:08:12.055 --> 01:08:14.757 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE MARGIN YOU GOTTA

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:16.225 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING

DIVEST SPENT IS AN ACTIVE CELL

01:08:41.384 --> 01:08:44.821 region:rollup2
DECISION.

01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:46.789 region:rollup2
YOU ARE TELLING US THAT THAT

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:48.958 region:rollup2
COMPANY OR THAT INDUSTRY. IS NOT

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:50.360 region:rollup2
ALLOWED FOR US TO INVEST IN.

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:52.261 region:rollup2
AND YOU TAKE ARE VOICE OUT OF

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.563 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION COMPLETELY.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.931 region:rollup2
WE GIVE A THOUGHT HOPEFULLY CAN

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:56.966 region:rollup2
RELATE TO IF THERE'S SOMEBODY A

01:08:54.931 --> 01:08:57.533 region:rollup2
LANDOWNER IN YOUR DISTRICT AND

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.868 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT

01:08:57.533 --> 01:09:00.269 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DOING.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:01.137 region:rollup2
ARE THEY BETTER OFF COMING TO

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:02.005 region:rollup2
YOUR OFFICE MAKING AN

01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:03.940 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT AND RAISING THEIR

01:09:02.005 --> 01:09:05.141 region:rollup2
VOICE.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:06.909 region:rollup2
OR SELLING THEIR LAND MOVING TO

01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:07.744 region:rollup2
THE NEXT DISTRICT.

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:09.312 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T CARE IF THEY SOLD

01:09:07.744 --> 01:09:11.114 region:rollup2
THEIR LAND THEY DIDN'T SULFUR

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:12.248 region:rollup2
LOST SOMEBODY ELSE BOUGHT IT.

01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:14.117 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU AT

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:14.717 region:rollup2
ALL THAT'S WHAT OU DO TO US

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:16.052 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU FORCE US INTO DIVEST

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:18.054 region:rollup2
MEANT.

01:09:16.052 --> 01:09:18.855 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE TURNED OUR BACK AND

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:20.189 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE I MET

01:09:18.855 --> 01:09:21.424 region:rollup2
WITH COMPANIES THEY DON'T KNOW

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:23.593 region:rollup2
OR CARE WHETHER WE OWN THE

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:26.195 region:rollup2
STOCKS ARE NOT.

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:29.065 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO INVEST

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:29.632 region:rollup2
GENERALLY ACTIVE AND PASSIVE

01:09:29.065 --> 01:09:31.300 region:rollup2
JODY FROM TRILLION MENTIONED

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:32.568 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.237 region:rollup2
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY IN

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:36.005 region:rollup2
EXPERTS AGREE THE MOST EFFICIENT

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:37.640 region:rollup2
WAY FOR US TO INVEST BILLIONS OF

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:39.575 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IS TO DO IT IN A STYLE

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.177 region:rollup2
CALLED INDEXING WE OWN THE

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:42.245 region:rollup2
ENTIRE MARKET.

01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:43.913 region:rollup2
MANY OF YOU HEARD OF THE SNP

01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:45.948 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED YOU HOLD ALL FIVE

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:47.717 region:rollup2
HUNDRED STOCKS.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:49.385 region:rollup2
WE EMPEROR'S OWN BOTHER INDEXES

01:09:47.717 --> 01:09:51.320 region:rollup2
WE ON THREE THOUSAND STOCKS IN

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:52.722 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:54.290 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN WE START TO DIVEST ALL

01:09:52.722 --> 01:09:55.091 region:rollup2
OF A SUDDEN WE ON TWO THOUSAND

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.726 region:rollup2
NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:58.494 region:rollup2
STOCKS.

01:09:56.726 --> 01:10:00.363 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T TRADE WITH SOMEBODY

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:01.998 region:rollup2
ELSE AS A WHOLE UNIT WE DON'T

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:03.566 region:rollup2
OWN THE ENTIRE MARKET.

01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:05.168 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE STARTING TO CUT AWAY

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:06.703 region:rollup2
AT THAT MORE AND MORE IN GETTING

01:10:05.168 --> 01:10:08.604 region:rollup2
CLOSER TO THAT ONE TENTH OF A

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:10.773 region:rollup2
PERCENT THE JACK MENTIONED.

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:14.610 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA EAT INTO OUR.

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:15.778 region:rollup2
RETURNS GOING LONG TERM.

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:17.747 region:rollup2
WE CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT MANY

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:19.115 region:rollup2
OF THE SOCIAL ISSUES AS JACK

01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:21.884 region:rollup2
SAID WE BELIEVE ANY S. T. WE

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:23.186 region:rollup2
CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:24.253 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO KNOW WE NEED TO EARN

01:10:23.186 --> 01:10:26.022 region:rollup2
A RETURN FOR THE FOR THE

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:26.522 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS.

01:10:26.022 --> 01:10:28.357 region:rollup2
THE VESTMENT IS LARGELY

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:30.393 region:rollup2
SYMBOLIC.

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:30.960 region:rollup2
IT'S MAKING A STATEMENT.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:33.029 region:rollup2
BUT IT COSTS US BILLIONS OF

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.164 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:36.165 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:37.633 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO DO IT INCREDIBLY COST

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:38.634 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:40.269 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I LOOKED AT THE TITLE

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:41.537 region:rollup2
OF YOUR HEARING.

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:43.806 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING THE VALUES OF

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:45.775 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO ME AND MY STAFF

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:48.644 region:rollup2
ARE FIRST IMPORTANT VALUE IS TO

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:50.813 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE R. ESTIMATED RETURN.

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:51.714 region:rollup2
IF THE COST OF THE SYSTEM AS LOW

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:53.783 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE FOR YOU IN THE

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:55.284 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:58.121 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIGHT IN THE CONSTITUTION

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:59.222 region:rollup2
AS YOU CITED THAT'S OUR MANDATE.

01:10:58.121 --> 01:11:01.424 region:rollup2
SO WE SHARE THE VALUES OF

CALIFORNIA. IF WE MEET THAT

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:05.128 region:rollup2
RETURN ASSUMPTION AND KEEP THE

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:07.296 region:rollup2
COSTS LOW. THE MORE WE CHANGE

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:08.831 region:rollup2
HOW WERE ALLOWED TO INVEST THE

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:10.766 region:rollup2
MORE YOU RESTRICT UNIVERSE.

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:12.468 region:rollup2
INCREASES ARE COST NOT ONLY ARE

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:14.170 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY COST OF NOT BEING

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:15.338 region:rollup2
ABLE INVEST IN THOSE AREAS. BUT

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:17.106 region:rollup2
EVEN OUR TRADING COSTS THE

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:18.741 region:rollup2
INABILITY FOR US TO MOVE THOSE

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:21.010 region:rollup2
BLOCKS OF STOCKS AS AN ENTIRE

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:23.146 region:rollup2
WHOLE UNIT.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:25.148 region:rollup2
AS JACK SAID WE EMBRACE CSG WE

01:11:23.146 --> 01:11:26.716 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOUD VOICE WE GO WHEN WE

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:28.184 region:rollup2
MEET WITH MULTIPLE COMPANIES

HAVE ENJOYED THIS HEARING AS

01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:25.735 region:rollup2
WELL. SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.936 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT CALPERS WE

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:29.338 region:rollup2
SERVE ABOUT TWO TWO MILLION

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:31.274 region:rollup2
MEMBERS ARE NOT INCLUDING THEIR

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:33.009 region:rollup2
<c.green>ENEFICIARIES ARE FUND IS AROUND</c>

01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:34.677 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION. ON

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:35.978 region:rollup2
BUT OUR LIABILITIES WHICH IS

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:37.613 region:rollup2
REALLY THE THE MEMBERSHIP THE

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:39.348 region:rollup2
PENSION BENEFITS FOR ABOUT A

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:40.216 region:rollup2
HALF TRILLION.

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.117 region:rollup2
SO YOU TAKE THAT MATH AND THAT

01:13:40.216 --> 01:13:42.518 region:rollup2
LEASES TO ABOUT A SIXTY EIGHT

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:43.819 region:rollup2
PERCENT FUNDED STAFF.

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:46.122 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE THING WE

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:47.923 region:rollup2
HAVE ON OUR MIND AT CALPERS IT'S

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:49.258 region:rollup2
ON THE MIND OF THE INVESTORS.

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:50.826 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE IT IS AND

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:52.228 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ON THE MINDS OF OUR

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:53.029 region:rollup2
BOARD.

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:54.530 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK TO OUR MEMBERS WE

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.665 region:rollup2
TALK TO OUR EMPLOYERS THE ONE

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:57.433 region:rollup2
THING THE MEMBER IS MOST

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:58.567 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHETHER THERE

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.936 region:rollup2
BENEFIT IS SAFE.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:01.337 region:rollup2
IS THAT BENEFIT GOING TO BE

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:03.172 region:rollup2
THERE AT THE TIME THAT I RETIRED

01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:04.373 region:rollup2
SO MOST CRITICAL THING ON THEIR

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:05.741 region:rollup2
MIND OUR CONTACT CENTER IS

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:07.343 region:rollup2
INUNDATED WITH PHONE CALLS

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:10.446 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT

01:14:07.343 --> 01:14:12.315 region:rollup2
NUMBER. IS ARE ALARMING TO THEM.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:14.283 region:rollup2
FOR THE EMPLOYERS AND THEY'RE A

01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:15.418 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDER.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.752 region:rollup2
I HAVE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO

01:14:15.418 --> 01:14:18.087 region:rollup2
THEM IS THAT THE SYSTEM REMAIN

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:19.922 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE FOR THAT IT BECOMES

01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:21.524 region:rollup2
MORE AFFORDABLE.

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:23.259 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT DECISIONS

01:14:21.524 --> 01:14:24.660 region:rollup2
LIKE ACID ALLOCATION AND WE LOOK

01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:26.095 region:rollup2
AT DECISIONS LIKE DISCOUNT RATE

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.229 region:rollup2
WERE BALANCING NOT

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:28.564 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY OF THE FIND BOTH

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:31.400 region:rollup2
FROM THE MEMBERS PERSPECTIVE AS

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:32.968 region:rollup2
WELL AS FROM THE EMPLOYER.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.836 region:rollup2
SO JUST QUICKLY I WE DID LEAVE

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:35.204 region:rollup2
YOU SOME MATERIALS THAT TALK

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:37.106 region:rollup2
ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT BELIEVES

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:37.573 region:rollup2
MUCH LIKE CASTERS WE DO HAVE

01:14:37.106 --> 01:14:38.574 region:rollup2
BELIEFS THAT GUIDE OUR

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:39.842 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:41.110 region:rollup2
AYE WE THINK THAT THE INVESTMENT

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:43.112 region:rollup2
BELIEVES CREATE MORE OF A

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:44.980 region:rollup2
COMMENT EXPECTATION AS WELL AS

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:47.316 region:rollup2
DIRECTION FROM THE BOARD. FROM

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:49.285 region:rollup2
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INTO THE

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:50.319 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT OPERATION ITSELF.

01:14:49.285 --> 01:14:52.755 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:53.489 region:rollup2
NGUYEN TO ENGAGE ON ISSUE

01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:55.291 region:rollup2
OFFICIALLY FOR AIR AREAS ARE

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:57.159 region:rollup2
FOUR THINGS THAT WE THINK ABOUT.

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:58.194 region:rollup2
ON THE FIRST IS THE ALIGNMENT

01:14:57.159 --> 01:15:00.229 region:rollup2
WITH THE PRINCIPLES AND THE

01:14:58.194 --> 01:15:00.763 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT BELIEVES THAT AGAIN

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:01.864 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A COPY OF IN YOUR

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:03.399 region:rollup2
FOLDERS.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:04.300 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND IS WHETHER THE

01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:06.268 region:rollup2
ISSUE HAS A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.436 region:rollup2
OUR FUNDS.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:09.171 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN GET INVOLVED IN A

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:10.973 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF ISSUES IN A NUMBER OF

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:12.508 region:rollup2
ITEMS THAT TAKE OUR EYE OFF THE

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:14.577 region:rollup2
BALL THAT THE BALL REALLY IS

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:17.413 region:rollup2
CREATING THAT MATERIAL. IMPACT

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:18.581 region:rollup2
AND SIDE WORKING ON GETTING A

01:15:17.413 --> 01:15:19.949 region:rollup2
BETTER FUNDED STATUS FOR THIS

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:21.650 region:rollup2
BOND.

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:23.319 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO THAT OUR INFLUENCE

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:25.421 region:rollup2
IS LIKELY TO GENERATE AND

01:15:23.319 --> 01:15:27.356 region:rollup2
MEASURABLE OUTCOME OR IF WE

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:28.758 region:rollup2
PARTNER WITH PARTNERS LIKE CAL

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:30.493 region:rollup2
CASTERS OR NEW YORK OR.

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:32.461 region:rollup2
ATTACHED.

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:35.064 region:rollup2
TEACHERS CAN WE ALSO MAKE OUR

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:36.532 region:rollup2
VOICE WHICH IS LOUD ON ITS OWN I

01:15:35.064 --> 01:15:38.467 region:rollup2

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:42.972 region:rollup2
MORE LOUD WHEN WE CAN.

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:44.907 region:rollup2
PARTNER UP WITH SOME OF THE

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:45.941 region:rollup2
OTHER PUBLIC PENSION PLANS.

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:47.510 region:rollup2
AND IN THE FOURTH IS THAT WE

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:49.178 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY OF THE CAPACITY THE

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:51.480 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES TO

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.547 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S WHEN HIS ARM DOESN'T

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.515 region:rollup2
PRODUCE FINALLY.

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:01.283 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL CAPITAL HAS TO BE

01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:03.119 region:rollup2
JOINED WITH HUMAN CAPITAL.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:05.254 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COMMUNITIES

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:07.056 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS SUPPLY CHAINS

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:08.824 region:rollup2
HUMAN CAPITAL IS VITAL TO

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:10.693 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT RETURNS.

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:12.595 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO KNOW THE PHYSICAL

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:13.496 region:rollup2
CAPITAL WHAT SOMETIMES WITH

01:17:12.595 --> 01:17:15.131 region:rollup2
NATURAL CAPITAL IS VITALLY

01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:16.832 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:18.601 region:rollup2
COMPANIES LOOKING AT ISSUES LIKE

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:20.903 region:rollup2
WATER SHORTAGE WILL THE IMPACT

01:17:18.601 --> 01:17:22.404 region:rollup2
OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARM OF HAVING

01:17:20.903 --> 01:17:24.373 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE.

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:25.474 region:rollup2
MAINSTREAM BUSINESS ISSUES

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:27.009 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:28.677 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT BELIEVES IS RATHER

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:30.846 region:rollup2
THAN TALK ABOUT YES GEE WE TALK

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:32.381 region:rollup2
ABOUT LONG TERM VALUE CREATION.

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:34.183 region:rollup2
AND THE NEED TO MANAGE THESE

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:35.217 region:rollup2
THREE FORMS OF CAPITAL.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:37.353 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE LOOK IT'S

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:39.388 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OR LOOK AT

01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:40.422 region:rollup2
HUMAN RIGHTS OR LABOR ISSUES

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.824 region:rollup2
WHICH TALKING ABOUT HOW DO THEY

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:43.993 region:rollup2
PROTECT.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:46.162 region:rollup2
THE RISK AND RETURN OF THE FUND.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:49.231 region:rollup2
CERTAIN OUR EXPERIENCE A CALPERS

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:51.200 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A TRADEOFF BETWEEN.

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:52.701 region:rollup2
DO YOU DO THE RIGHT THING OR DO

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.770 region:rollup2
YOU GO OUT THERE TO MAKE MONEY

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:57.239 region:rollup2
WHAT WE KNOWING GLOBAL MARKETS

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:59.475 region:rollup2
IS THAT COMPANIES NEED TO

01:17:57.239 --> 01:18:01.043 region:rollup2
RECRUIT THE BEST TALENT. THE

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:02.978 region:rollup2
NEED TO BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY TO

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:04.713 region:rollup2
MANAGE RISK AND CERTAINLY THEY

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:06.081 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE TACKLING. THE RISKS

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:07.750 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE OPPORTUNITIES OF

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:10.553 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:11.487 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T JUST I SHOTS

01:18:10.553 --> 01:18:12.955 region:rollup2
OURSELVES IN A ROOM AND COME TO

01:18:11.487 --> 01:18:14.890 region:rollup2
THAT CONCLUSION WE WHEN WE

01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:17.026 region:rollup2
STARTED LOOKING AT A STRATEGY

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:18.594 region:rollup2
FOR THE TOTAL FUND. WE DID A

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.729 region:rollup2
VERY COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL

01:18:18.594 --> 01:18:22.131 region:rollup2
THE ACADEMIC PAPERS THAT WERE

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.831 region:rollup2
OUT THERE ON THE FIRST TIME

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:24.533 region:rollup2
WHICH AFLOAT WE FOUND EIGHT

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:26.802 region:rollup2
HUNDRED. AND THE SECOND TIME WE

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:28.470 region:rollup2
TOOK A LOT LAST YEAR WE WERE

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:29.705 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND PAPERS

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:31.073 region:rollup2
SO WE REALLY FEEL WE'VE GONE

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:32.074 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS IN A VERY RIGOROUS

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:32.741 region:rollup2
WHY WE'D BE GLAD TO SHARE THE

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:34.376 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE WITH YOU.

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:36.212 region:rollup2
IT'S HELPFUL

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:37.446 region:rollup2
SO JUST TO FINISH TWO PRACTICAL

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:39.481 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF WHAT DOES THIS LOOK

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:42.184 region:rollup2
LIKE WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:45.521 region:rollup2
GOING TO ENGAGE OWN FINANCIAL

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:47.856 region:rollup2
HUMAN. AND PHYSICAL CAPITAL.

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:49.291 region:rollup2
NOW CLIMATE CHANGE ARM IS AN

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:51.293 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT OUR

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:52.428 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO GLOBALLY.

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:54.230 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM

01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:55.397 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST A STORY OF EXTREME

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.066 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURE AROUND EXTREME

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:58.968 region:rollup2
WEATHER EVENTS.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:19:00.002 region:rollup2
I'M WATER SHORTAGE AND FLOODING

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:01.503 region:rollup2
IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT

01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:02.271 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:04.073 region:rollup2
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:07.076 region:rollup2
TRANSITION IN THE WORLD'S ENERGY

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:09.578 region:rollup2
SECTOR TO GO FROM HIGH COLTON TO

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:10.679 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES THAT'S A THIRTY YEAR

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:12.748 region:rollup2
TRANSITION WHICH THAT'S

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:14.617 region:rollup2
FANTASTIC NEED FOR INVESTMENT.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:16.252 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:18.420 region:rollup2
INVESTORS TO TAKE.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:19.688 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ENGAGE

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.523 region:rollup2
THE COMPANIES AT THE HEART OF

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:22.491 region:rollup2
THIS TRANSITION AND MAKE SURE

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:23.792 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:25.894 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE YEAR TRANSITION AND

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:27.529 region:rollup2
STILL BE IN BUSINESS.

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:29.231 region:rollup2
NOW IF WE WALK AWAY.

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:30.699 region:rollup2
TWO THINGS ONE IS WAS RIGHT HE

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:32.267 region:rollup2
SAID WE SALAS SHASTA SOMEONE

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:33.902 region:rollup2
ELSE WHO MAY NOT SHARE THE

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:35.404 region:rollup2
VALUES OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:36.238 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS.

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:37.673 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO WE'VE LOST THE

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:39.275 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ANY

01:19:37.673 --> 01:19:40.342 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE ACTUAL.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:42.244 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS MY WORLD GOVERNMENT

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:44.313 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN DRIVE THIS CHANGE.

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:46.448 region:rollup2
OWNERS OF COMPANIES HAVE THE

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:47.650 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE RIGHTS OF

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.817 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:51.186 region:rollup2
MITCHELL THIS TRANSITION TAKES

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:53.355 region:rollup2
PLACE A LOT IS GOING TO PROTECT

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:55.691 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT RETURNS FROM MEMBERS.

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:58.093 region:rollup2
THE SECOND EXAMPLE IS DIVERSITY

01:19:55.691 --> 01:20:00.396 region:rollup2
AND INCLUSION.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:20:02.264 region:rollup2
WE SEE EXCELLENT EVIDENCE

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:03.899 region:rollup2
THAT COMPANIES NEEDING TO

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:05.868 region:rollup2
ATTRACT THE BEST TALENT

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:06.702 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES

01:20:05.868 --> 01:20:08.137 region:rollup2
TO ONE TINY SECTION OF THE

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:09.938 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:10.472 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY COLLUSION IS GOOD FOR

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:12.474 region:rollup2
TALENT MANAGEMENT IS GOOD

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:13.242 region:rollup2
FORENSURING YOU DON'T HAVE GROUP

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.743 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:17.079 region:rollup2
AS LAWSUIT.

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:19.081 region:rollup2
SOCIAL JUSTICE REASONS TO FOSTER

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:20.649 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY INCLUSION BUT WE SEE

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:23.319 region:rollup2
THE GOOD RESULTS THAT COMPANIES

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:25.654 region:rollup2
CAN CAPTURE IF THEY HAVE OF A

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:27.156 region:rollup2
DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE CULTURE.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:28.190 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE PURSUING NOT FROM AN

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:30.159 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT POINT TRIBUNE

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.693 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.293 region:rollup2
WITH CAO STARS ARE A WITH

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:34.329 region:rollup2
OTHER-FORMS WITH ENGAGING OVER

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:36.265 region:rollup2
FIVE

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:38.967 region:rollup2
HUNDRED COMPANIES RIGHT NOW

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:39.702 region:rollup2
WHICH HAVE ENTIRELY MILD BOARDS.

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:41.236 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:41.837 region:rollup2
COMPANIES RUSHING MISSING OUT ON

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:43.539 region:rollup2
THAILAND IS GOING TO HELP THEM

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:45.641 region:rollup2
WITH RETURNS.

01:20:43.539 --> 01:20:47.876 region:rollup2
SO IN CONCLUSION I THINK THAT IS

01:20:45.641 --> 01:20:50.312 region:rollup2
A FALSE CHOICE.

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:51.447 region:rollup2
A WHAT WAS ONCE CALLED BY THE

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:52.981 region:rollup2
SEA OF JOHNSON AND JOHNSON IS

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:55.584 region:rollup2
THE.

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:57.653 region:rollup2
TYRANNY OF THE OR.

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:59.054 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT EITHER COOL IT'S ISLAND

01:20:57.653 --> 01:21:00.422 region:rollup2
AND AS WELL LESS

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:02.091 region:rollup2
SO IN OTHER WORDS I HAVE YOU IS

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:03.959 region:rollup2
THAT BY FOCUSING ON HUMAN

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:05.594 region:rollup2
CAPITAL. AND LOOKING AT PHYSICAL

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:07.262 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:09.031 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT WE

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:10.599 region:rollup2
COMBAT SUPPORT TECH PENSIONS

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:12.735 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE GOT BASS OF RISK

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:13.602 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AND WE ALSO HAVE GOOD

01:21:12.735 --> 01:21:16.071 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE WITH AND TO GET BETTER.

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:18.107 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:20.008 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH.

01:21:18.107 --> 01:21:20.242 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:23.112 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:26.615 region:rollup2
.

01:21:23.112 --> 01:21:27.883 region:rollup2
CORD OKAY CENTER MORLOCK.

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:31.553 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:33.422 region:rollup2
WELL CHRIS.

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:35.891 region:rollup2
.

01:21:33.422 --> 01:21:36.658 region:rollup2
I'VE ALWAYS OF. FALL THE DICTUM

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:39.361 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:41.330 region:rollup2
WHICH THAT MANAGERS MANAGE.

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:43.399 region:rollup2
AND IT'S YOUR JOB.

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:45.968 region:rollup2
TO INVEST THE FUNDS.

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:47.503 region:rollup2
AND I'M EMPOWERING YOU TO DO THE

01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:48.070 region:rollup2
BEST YOU CAN COULD YOU GET THE

01:21:47.503 --> 01:21:49.505 region:rollup2
BLOOMBERG TERMINALS IN FRONT

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.939 region:rollup2
IDEA.

01:21:49.505 --> 01:21:52.608 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT MONEY MANAGERS THAT

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:55.577 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HIRED YOU GOT.

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:57.746 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE MONEY MANAGERS INSIDE.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:59.581 region:rollup2
AND SO. YOU GET THE FAA'S SO SO

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:01.350 region:rollup2
I WANT YOU TO TO DO THE BEST YOU

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:02.751 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY CAN.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:04.920 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF THE TAXPAYERS

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:06.422 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.524 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:10.058 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:22:08.524 --> 01:22:11.293 region:rollup2
WELL WHEN DO YOU SAY TO THE

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:13.095 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:14.930 region:rollup2
I THINK YOUR BILL IS

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:17.032 region:rollup2
TERRIBLE AND EVEN IF YOU VOTE

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:20.836 region:rollup2
FOR IT AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNS

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:22.171 region:rollup2
THAT. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO.

01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:23.806 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE TAKEN.

01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:25.641 region:rollup2
USUALLY AT OPPOSED UNLESS

01:22:23.806 --> 01:22:26.775 region:rollup2
AMENDED POSITION ON EVERY SINGLE

01:22:25.641 --> 01:22:28.544 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT BILL.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:29.211 region:rollup2
WE'VE TRIED TO PUT WORDS INTO

01:22:28.544 --> 01:22:30.746 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR COULD SAVE

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:32.147 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE ON OUR BOARD THAT

01:22:30.746 --> 01:22:33.582 region:rollup2
WE DON'T THINK THAT'S AN

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:36.418 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY TO LIMIT US.

01:22:33.582 --> 01:22:38.454 region:rollup2
IN THE END R. BOARD HAS CHOSEN

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:40.789 region:rollup2
TO THEN RESEARCH IT. THEY HAVE

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:42.891 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE AGAIN MOST OF THE

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:44.526 region:rollup2
DIVESTITURE HAVE BEEN FAIRLY

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:46.728 region:rollup2
FINITE AND IN MATERIAL.

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:47.830 region:rollup2
OUR BOARD HAS CHOSEN NOT TO TO

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:49.731 region:rollup2
PULL UP THAT FIDUCIARY FLAG AND

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:50.933 region:rollup2
SAYING NO.

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:52.000 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD HAVE SAY WERE

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:53.335 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GETTING VERY CLOSE TO

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.870 region:rollup2
THAT AND SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:58.106 region:rollup2
THAT ARE COMING OUT.

01:22:54.870 --> 01:23:00.275 region:rollup2
WELL YOUR REPORT SHOWS THAT.

01:22:58.106 --> 01:23:01.844 region:rollup2
BEEN LOSERS SO FAR RIGHT FELLOW

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:03.645 region:rollup2
THERE BEEN I'VE BEEN APART OF

01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:05.147 region:rollup2
FIVE DIVEST AND STIRS DONE SIX

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.814 region:rollup2
OVERALL AND RIGHT NOW ALL OF

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:07.950 region:rollup2
THEM ARE.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.550 region:rollup2
PRODUCING NEGATIVE RESULTS WERE

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:08.884 region:rollup2
UNDERPERFORMING DUE TO THAT WE

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:11.086 region:rollup2
COULD.

01:23:08.884 --> 01:23:13.755 region:rollup2
.

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:16.091 region:rollup2
SO.

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:19.094 region:rollup2
DO YOU PROVIDE.

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:21.430 region:rollup2
A COMPARISON TO LET'S SAY THE

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:21.964 region:rollup2
FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED.

01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:24.333 region:rollup2
DB PLANTS IF THEY'RE STILL

01:23:21.964 --> 01:23:26.268 region:rollup2
ANNIE.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:27.536 region:rollup2
AND THEIR PERFORMANCE

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:30.172 region:rollup2
SAY THE ANNUAL RATE OF RETURN

01:23:27.536 --> 01:23:32.374 region:rollup2
SAY AN AVERAGE.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:33.809 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO YOUR GREATER RETURN

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:35.611 region:rollup2
AND THE CALPERS WRITER TRAIN SO

01:23:33.809 --> 01:23:36.144 region:rollup2
WE CAN. SHOW THAT YOU ARE

01:23:35.611 --> 01:23:38.580 region:rollup2
TRENDING WITH THE PRIVATE

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:40.516 region:rollup2
SECTOR.

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:42.150 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE IF YOU'RE DOING

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.684 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN YOU'RE ADDING VALUE

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.553 region:rollup2
TO THE TAXPAYERS IF YOU'RE

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:45.921 region:rollup2
DOING.

01:23:44.553 --> 01:23:46.822 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE BELOW THE AVERAGE AND

01:23:45.921 --> 01:23:48.290 region:rollup2
THEN MAYBE WE HAVE AN

01:23:46.822 --> 01:23:50.692 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION.

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:52.394 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:53.362 region:rollup2
IT'S S. CENTER MORE LIKE KNOWS

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:54.630 region:rollup2
IT INVESTMENTS A HIGHLY

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:56.231 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE FIELD SO WE HAVE

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:57.599 region:rollup2
THOSE COMPARISONS TO US TO

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:59.501 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR US THE PUBLIC

01:23:57.599 --> 01:24:00.736 region:rollup2
SECTOR LARGE SMALL AND EVEN NINE

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:02.271 region:rollup2
U. S. PLANTS.

01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:03.238 region:rollup2
ASSET ALLOCATION IS THE BIGGEST

01:24:02.271 --> 01:24:04.606 region:rollup2
DETERMINANT OR WHETHER WE'RE

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:06.208 region:rollup2
SUCCEEDING OR NOT.

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:08.110 region:rollup2
AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO DIS

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.877 region:rollup2
AGGREGATE THAT WHAT'S CAUSING

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:10.345 region:rollup2
THE OUTPERFORMANCE R. UNDER

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:11.847 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:14.016 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN OUR

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:15.617 region:rollup2
CASE OF OUR PORTFOLIO WE'VE BEEN

01:24:14.016 --> 01:24:19.121 region:rollup2
TOP QUARTILE OVER.

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:21.023 region:rollup2
THREE FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS ARM

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:21.924 region:rollup2
UP RELATIVE TO PUBLIC PENSION

01:24:21.023 --> 01:24:23.191 region:rollup2
PLANS TO HAVE A LOOK TO

01:24:21.924 --> 01:24:25.060 region:rollup2
CORPORATE LATELY BECAUSE A LOT

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:25.694 region:rollup2
OF THEM ONTO A LIABILITY TO.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.095 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO SO THEY WOULD BE UNDER

01:24:25.694 --> 01:24:29.031 region:rollup2
PERFORM.

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:29.631 region:rollup2
THOUGH IS THAT WE DO MEASURE TRY

01:24:29.031 --> 01:24:29.865 region:rollup2
AND SHOW WHETHER WE'RE ADDING

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:30.265 region:rollup2
VALUE.

01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:31.633 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:34.236 region:rollup2
YES.

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:35.270 region:rollup2
SO YOU COULD.

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:36.905 region:rollup2
WHAT OUT THERE ON THE WEBSITE

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:38.006 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THAT?

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:39.241 region:rollup2
THE BIG ISSUE NOW OF COURSE IS

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:39.841 region:rollup2
R. UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND SO

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:41.777 region:rollup2
NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR PLANTS BY

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:44.012 region:rollup2
SAYING.

01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:45.480 region:rollup2
THEY WERE HAVING DIFFICULT WERE.

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:47.649 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE BRICK WORD ACTUALLY.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.518 region:rollup2
COUNTING THE MONTHS.

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:51.386 region:rollup2
WHEN WE RUN OUT OF CASH SO THAT

01:24:49.518 --> 01:24:52.087 region:rollup2
YOUR PRESSURE. YEAH BUT YOU'RE

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:54.556 region:rollup2
STILL.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:56.725 region:rollup2
MANAGING.

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:58.560 region:rollup2
PER VALUE AND YOUR FOCUS IS

01:24:56.725 --> 01:25:00.095 region:rollup2
STILL JUST TO DO THE BEST YOU

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.629 region:rollup2
CAN WITH THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE.

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.364 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THE OUTSIDE

01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:04.199 region:rollup2
PRESSURES.

01:25:02.364 --> 01:25:06.201 region:rollup2
IT IS AN OUR REQUEST IS DON'T

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:08.103 region:rollup2
NARROW OUR UNIVERSE DON'T LIMIT

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:09.504 region:rollup2
OUR OPPORTUNITY SET ALLOW US TO

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:11.273 region:rollup2
MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO WE'RE

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:12.407 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING THESE VALUES WE

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:14.710 region:rollup2
THINK IN THE WAY WE'RE INVESTING

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:16.144 region:rollup2
IN AND. TRYING TO GET THE MAX

01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:17.245 region:rollup2
RARE RETURN AT APPROVED LEVEL OF

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:18.380 region:rollup2
RISK AND AT THE LOWEST COST

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:20.882 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:23.218 region:rollup2
THE COMPUTER.

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:25.187 region:rollup2
GUARANTEES.

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:26.521 region:rollup2
BUT QUESTION TALK ABOUT.

01:25:25.187 --> 01:25:28.357 region:rollup2
THE BUILDINGS OF DOLLARS ㍹

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:29.858 region:rollup2
IN THESE PREVIOUS DIVESTMENT

01:25:28.357 --> 01:25:31.560 region:rollup2
BILLS BUT ALSO WAS THE COSTS

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:32.894 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED RIGHT TO THOSE ALSO

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.230 region:rollup2
CAUSES SO SHOULD OWN GUARDED AYE

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:37.065 region:rollup2
VAST. HOW DOES THAT WORK ON HOW

01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:38.133 region:rollup2
MUCH LOSS OF THAT AS WELL?

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:39.201 region:rollup2
YEAH THEIR TRANSACTION COSTS

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.802 region:rollup2
WHEN WE SELL WE WE TRIED TO BE

01:25:39.201 --> 01:25:42.437 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY EFFICIENT MY EXAMPLE

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:43.572 region:rollup2
TO TO YOU OF THE MEMBER IN YOUR

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:44.706 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THAT'S NOT HAPPY

01:25:43.572 --> 01:25:46.241 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GONNA THROW THEIR

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:48.543 region:rollup2
HOUSE ON THE MARKET AND HURT

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:49.778 region:rollup2
THEM SELVES. SO WERE LIKEWISE

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:51.480 region:rollup2
OUR FIDUCIARY SONIC IMAGES DUMP

01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:52.881 region:rollup2
THE SHARES ON THE MARKET WE'RE

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.149 region:rollup2
GONNA SELL THEM AS EFFICIENTLY.

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:55.450 region:rollup2
THAT DOES CREATE TRANSACTION

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:57.052 region:rollup2
COST AND THEN WE HAVE TO

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:58.787 region:rollup2
REDEPLOY THAT CAPITAL WE ALSO

01:25:57.052 --> 01:26:00.422 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF EXTRA FEES

01:25:58.787 --> 01:26:02.357 region:rollup2
TO PEOPLE THE BILE THE SPECIALTY

01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:03.458 region:rollup2
INDEXES AND MEASUREMENTS.

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:04.860 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE BOOK OF THE BILLS

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:07.629 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED HAVE HAVE

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:09.264 region:rollup2
LIKE THE SUDAN BILL THE RANDALL.

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:10.399 region:rollup2
AB GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES THAT WE

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:12.300 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HIRE OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO

01:26:10.399 --> 01:26:13.568 region:rollup2
REALLY TELL US.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:15.203 region:rollup2
WHAT IF THE FRENCH OIL COMPANY

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:16.872 region:rollup2
AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN SUDAN

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:19.141 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A CHINESE OIL COMPANY R.

01:26:16.872 --> 01:26:20.642 region:rollup2
INDONESIAN MANUFACTURED DOING IN

01:26:19.141 --> 01:26:22.477 region:rollup2
SUDAN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THERE?

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:24.346 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE ADDED RESEARCH COSTS

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:26.348 region:rollup2
AND ADDED INDEX BECAUSE.

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:27.816 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE SOME MUCH SMALLER THAN

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:28.817 region:rollup2
THE OVERALL DOLLAR LOSS OF THE

01:26:27.816 --> 01:26:34.156 region:rollup2
OF THE EXCLUDING THOSE

01:26:28.817 --> 01:26:34.322 region:rollup2
SECURITIES.

01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:36.124 region:rollup2
SO.

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:36.858 region:rollup2
THOUGH I THINK IT'S SO MUCH FOR

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:39.661 region:rollup2
YOUR PRESENTATIONS.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:42.330 region:rollup2
SO WHERE THINGS THAT'S COME UP

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:43.432 region:rollup2
IS COURSE AYE AYE AYE I'D.

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:46.368 region:rollup2
MY GUESS IS IS THAT.

01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:47.903 region:rollup2
MIKE MAY MY COLLEAGUES WILL NOT

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:49.538 region:rollup2
STOP WRITING R. DON'T BE

01:26:47.903 --> 01:26:50.605 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS WHO WON'T TALK

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:52.708 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE BEST MEN AND WHAT

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:54.276 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY I THINK ON ONE LEVEL

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:55.577 region:rollup2
AND THE NOSE COMMENTED WELL THE

01:26:54.276 --> 01:26:57.145 region:rollup2
VESTMENT ISN'T VERY EFFECTIVE

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:58.847 region:rollup2
BUT PEOPLE POINT TO EXAMPLES

01:26:57.145 --> 01:27:00.649 region:rollup2
LIKE APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA

01:26:58.847 --> 01:27:02.284 region:rollup2
WHERE TEAMS LIKE THE VESTMENT.

01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:03.819 region:rollup2
WAS WHAT DROVE FINALLY DROVE.

01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:04.286 region:rollup2
SAID THE GOVERNMENT TO FINALLY

01:27:03.819 --> 01:27:06.021 region:rollup2
YELLED.

01:27:04.286 --> 01:27:08.256 region:rollup2
THAT DERIVE APARTHEID TELLING

01:27:06.021 --> 01:27:10.225 region:rollup2
PEOPLE I THAT.

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:11.927 region:rollup2
WE CAN THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:13.462 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OPINIONS BUT.

01:27:11.927 --> 01:27:14.963 region:rollup2
OKAY WELL ANYWAY DOES APPEAL

01:27:13.462 --> 01:27:17.399 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT.

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:18.300 region:rollup2
THAT AS WELL AND I THINK. I'M

01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:20.335 region:rollup2
NOT SURE WE CAN JUST SIMPLY SAY

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:22.270 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT OVERALL DOESN'T DO

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:22.738 region:rollup2
ANYTHING I MEAN.

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.873 region:rollup2
I AM NOT SURE THAT'S A

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:26.374 region:rollup2
REALISTIC.

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:27.542 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS MAKE AYE THINKING TALK

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:29.211 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS AND

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:32.047 region:rollup2
THEN WE'LL AND AND ALTERNATIVES

01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:34.416 region:rollup2
TO THAT. BUT.

01:27:32.047 --> 01:27:35.884 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION IS THAT WHEN ARM BUT

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:37.285 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DO COME UP AND THEY HAVE

01:27:35.884 --> 01:27:37.786 region:rollup2
RELIGION IT REASONS FOR SAYING

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:40.522 region:rollup2
ALL WHY IS THE STATE OF

01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:41.590 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA INVOLVED IN. SUCH AND

01:27:40.522 --> 01:27:43.158 region:rollup2
SUCH OR SUCH THOSE WHATEVER.

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:44.893 region:rollup2
.

01:27:43.158 --> 01:27:46.595 region:rollup2
IT WAS A POLICY COMMITTEE ARE

01:27:44.893 --> 01:27:48.296 region:rollup2
ARE POLICY COMMITTEES ON THE

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:50.265 region:rollup2
BOTH HOUSES AND WE HVE TO. DEAL

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:51.399 region:rollup2
IT RIGHT WE HAVE AND SO FORTH.

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:53.568 region:rollup2
.

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:55.604 region:rollup2
IS

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:57.739 region:rollup2
I WOULD ASK EACH OF YOU ARM IS.

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:59.541 region:rollup2
IS YOUR ARE YOUR RESPECTIVE

01:27:57.739 --> 01:28:02.177 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ABLE TO WE SAID

01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:03.745 region:rollup2
OKAY WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN

01:28:02.177 --> 01:28:05.914 region:rollup2
AND OUR ANALYSIS THE BILL TO

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:08.150 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL COST TO

CONDUCT THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS I

01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:46.121 region:rollup2
THINK I THINK THE CURRENT SPEED

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:47.722 region:rollup2
BUMP OF FOR THE FISCAL ANALYSIS

01:28:46.121 --> 01:28:49.257 region:rollup2
IS ISN'T HIGH ENOUGH.

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:50.659 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE GRAVITY THESE BILLS A

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:52.093 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:54.029 region:rollup2
SOMEONE COOLEY KNOWS FROM THE

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:55.864 region:rollup2
INSURANCE INDUSTRY I WHEN I WAS

01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:57.632 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER COLORADO.

OFTEN HAVE MANDATED BENEFIT

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.770 region:rollup2
BILLS COME TO CAPITALS AND

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:03.371 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALWAYS EMOTIONAL LIKE

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:05.140 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES ARE THE ADVOCATES

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:07.008 region:rollup2
FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THESE ISSUES

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.677 region:rollup2
SO. IT'S HARD TO GET A GOOD

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:10.245 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AROUND THE FACTS

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:12.414 region:rollup2
AND FIGURES AROUND THIS IN THE

01:29:10.245 --> 01:29:14.115 region:rollup2
INSURANCE INDUSTRY OVER TWENTY

01:29:12.414 --> 01:29:15.684 region:rollup2
SIX STATES AND EIGHT OZ STATE

01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:17.219 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURES HAVE MANDATED

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:18.520 region:rollup2
BENEFIT REVIEW LAWS.

01:29:17.219 --> 01:29:20.589 region:rollup2
ACQUIRING EXTRAORDINARY

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.324 region:rollup2
PROCESSES AROUND LOOKING

01:29:20.589 --> 01:29:23.925 region:rollup2
INSURANCE MANDATES JUST TO MAKE

01:29:22.324 --> 01:29:25.994 region:rollup2
SURE IT'S DONE IN A TECHNICAL

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:26.261 region:rollup2
WAY AN OBJECTIVE WAY ON THAT

01:29:25.994 --> 01:29:28.530 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

01:29:26.261 --> 01:29:30.098 region:rollup2
A PAYMENT OF REAL OF A REAL

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:32.234 region:rollup2
PARTY DOING IT SO THAT IS A

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:34.236 region:rollup2
THOROUGH ANALYSIS. WHEN I WAS

01:29:32.234 --> 01:29:35.570 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER BEYOND.

01:29:34.236 --> 01:29:37.105 region:rollup2
BILLS THAT ARE AGAINST SO

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:39.007 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AROUND AUTISM IN THOSE

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:40.475 region:rollup2
THINGS IT REALLY BRING MOTIONS

01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:41.910 region:rollup2
THE TABLE AND I THINK THAT

01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:43.278 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT OFFICE HELPS A LOT

01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:44.713 region:rollup2
SO I THINK EXTENT.

01:29:43.278 --> 01:29:46.448 region:rollup2
A PROCESS COULD BE SHAPE HERE

01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:48.516 region:rollup2
THAT RESEMBLES THAT I THINK

01:29:46.448 --> 01:29:49.517 region:rollup2
THEY'LL BE VERY EFFECTIVE THOUGH

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:51.119 region:rollup2
AND KNOW THAT THE FORGIVENESS

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:52.621 region:rollup2
DIVERSOS R. COMMITMENT FROM CAL

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:54.656 region:rollup2
STIRS THAN TO HELP US DO THAT I

01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:55.590 region:rollup2
WOULD GLADLY DO LIVE A LOT OF

01:29:54.656 --> 01:29:59.194 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH THAT ISSUE.

01:29:55.590 --> 01:30:00.528 region:rollup2
FIRST YES.

01:29:59.194 --> 01:30:03.298 region:rollup2
YES OR NO ANSWERS YES WE'RE

01:30:00.528 --> 01:30:04.199 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO ENGAGE.

01:30:03.298 --> 01:30:04.1000 region:rollup2
AB AND I THINK HOPE WILL

01:30:04.199 --> 01:30:06.668 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WHAT YOU'VE SEEN TODAY

01:30:04.1000 --> 01:30:08.069 region:rollup2
AND WILL CONTINUE ON THE FOURTH

01:30:06.668 --> 01:30:10.205 region:rollup2
PANEL IS MORE OF AN ALIGNMENT OF

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:11.806 region:rollup2
INTERESTS BETWEEN. THE MEMBER

01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:13.508 region:rollup2
GROUPS AND THE EMPLOYER GROUPS

01:30:11.806 --> 01:30:15.577 region:rollup2
AND THE PENSION FUNDS AROUND

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:17.846 region:rollup2
THIS TOPIC SO TRANSPARENCY

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:19.481 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT. ABSOLUTELY OKAY NOW

01:30:17.846 --> 01:30:20.749 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

01:30:19.481 --> 01:30:22.083 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO GET THAT

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:24.486 region:rollup2
KIND ANALYSIS WE KIND OF NEED

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:25.287 region:rollup2
DATA THAT YOU'RE READY HOLD SO

01:30:24.486 --> 01:30:27.689 region:rollup2
THAT'S BRING PORN.

01:30:25.287 --> 01:30:28.890 region:rollup2
AYE SIR LEYVA.

01:30:27.689 --> 01:30:30.325 region:rollup2
THINK CENTER PAN OF REALLY

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:31.726 region:rollup2
APPRECIABLE APPRECIATE ALL OF

01:30:30.325 --> 01:30:33.094 region:rollup2
YOU BEING HERE AND WHAT YOU DO

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:34.829 region:rollup2
FOR US EVERY DAY.

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:36.898 region:rollup2
I JUST WANTED TO A COUPLE

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:38.600 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AND THEN A BALLOT

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:40.669 region:rollup2
QUESTION. I SIT ON A PRIVATE

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.604 region:rollup2
TRUST FUND FOR TWELVE YEARS AND

01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:44.606 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS EXACTLY THE SAME

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:46.441 region:rollup2
ONE MY BENEFIT BE PAID AND THEN

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:47.909 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE IS CAN I AFFORD

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:49.177 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS.

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:51.279 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT MANY TIMES AYE

01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:52.314 region:rollup2
VESTMENTS ARE LARGELY SYMBOLIC

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.115 region:rollup2
AND COMING OUT OF THE LABOR

01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:55.550 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT I LIKE A GOOD FIGHT AS

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:56.384 region:rollup2
MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE WANNA MAKE

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.852 region:rollup2
SURE THAT FIGHT ACTUALLY

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:59.354 region:rollup2
TRANSLATES INTO SOMETHING THAT

01:30:57.852 --> 01:31:01.323 region:rollup2
HELPS FOLKS.

01:30:59.354 --> 01:31:03.024 region:rollup2
THE FUND IS CURRENTLY AT SIXTY

01:31:01.323 --> 01:31:06.494 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT IS UP WITH THE

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:07.395 region:rollup2
FUNDING CRITICAL STATUS.

01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:08.396 region:rollup2
SO IT IT'S REALLY A POINT IN

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:10.598 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:11.599 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:12.667 region:rollup2
SO IT'S THE THAT THE NUMBER OF

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:13.835 region:rollup2
ASSETS WE HAVE COMPARE.

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:15.570 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO.

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:17.305 region:rollup2
ANNUAL BASIS

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:19.207 region:rollup2
SO WE THERE IS A PATH TO MOVE

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:20.442 region:rollup2
TOWARD FULL FUNDING IT'S SAID

01:31:19.207 --> 01:31:21.209 region:rollup2
TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR PATH

01:31:20.442 --> 01:31:23.111 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT TWENTY TO TWENTY

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:24.279 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS THE RISKS THAT WE

01:31:23.111 --> 01:31:26.781 region:rollup2
HAVE IS SURVIVING THE MARKET

01:31:24.279 --> 01:31:28.216 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY. THE ONE AREA THAT WE

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:29.684 region:rollup2
ARE VERY MINDFUL OF.

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:31.252 region:rollup2
OR THE NUMBER THAT WERE VERY

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:33.355 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF IS NOT HAVING THAT

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:34.289 region:rollup2
FUNDED STATUS DROPPED TO AROUND

01:31:33.355 --> 01:31:35.457 region:rollup2
THE FIFTY PERCENT MARK THAT

01:31:34.289 --> 01:31:36.958 region:rollup2
MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR A

01:31:35.457 --> 01:31:38.059 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF OUR SIZE SCALE TO

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:40.362 region:rollup2
RECOVER FROM.

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:41.730 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A RISK FACTOR BUT AT

01:31:40.362 --> 01:31:42.530 region:rollup2
SOME POINT IN TIME WITH THE PLAN

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:44.532 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD THAT PLAN JUST

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:45.934 region:rollup2
HAPPENS TO BE.

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:47.469 region:rollup2
AND YOU FIT IT I DO UNDERSTAND

01:31:45.934 --> 01:31:48.970 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE LONG TERM WHEN YOU SEE

01:31:47.469 --> 01:31:50.372 region:rollup2
THOSE SHORT TERM RETURNS AND

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:52.073 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY SCARY AND YOU HAVE

01:31:50.372 --> 01:31:54.075 region:rollup2
TO REMEMBER LONG TERM. BUT DO

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:56.578 region:rollup2
YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE ON A PATH

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:58.580 region:rollup2
TO GET THE PLAN TO SEVENTY TO

01:31:56.578 --> 01:32:00.382 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY PERCENT

01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:02.450 region:rollup2
FULLY FUNDED.

01:32:00.382 --> 01:32:03.184 region:rollup2
WE DO BELIEVE FOR ON A PATH IN

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:04.853 region:rollup2
THERE THERE'D BEEN SOME

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:06.154 region:rollup2
DECISIONS MADE BY THIS BODY IN

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:07.455 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR THAT THE SIX

01:32:06.154 --> 01:32:09.057 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT TO HELP

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:10.825 region:rollup2
PAY DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY

01:32:09.057 --> 01:32:12.127 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL BUT. IT'S

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:13.862 region:rollup2
CONVERTED US FROM A NEGATIVE

01:32:12.127 --> 01:32:15.163 region:rollup2
CASH FLOW POSITION TO A POSITIVE

01:32:13.862 --> 01:32:17.198 region:rollup2
CASH FLOW POSITION FOR THIS

01:32:15.163 --> 01:32:17.866 region:rollup2
ENTIRE YEAR IT'S VERY HELPFUL

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:19.801 region:rollup2
WERE NOT SELLING ASSETS

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:22.137 region:rollup2
THE PAY BENEFITS.

01:32:19.801 --> 01:32:23.638 region:rollup2
I AM BUT AGAIN THAT PEPPER.

01:32:22.137 --> 01:32:24.572 region:rollup2

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:25.640 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE FOND OF PEPPER

OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.009 region:rollup2
CRITICAL OF HAVE BROUGHT. HAVE

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:29.511 region:rollup2
BRAT THAT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:31.446 region:rollup2
YEAR MARK WHEN PEPPER MEMBERS

BEGIN TO RETIRE YOU ACTUALLY SEE

01:32:31.446 --> 01:32:34.949 region:rollup2
THE LIABILITIES COME DOWN PRETTY

01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:36.885 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY SO. YES I DO

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:38.520 region:rollup2
BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:39.554 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MORE A DECISION. TO BE

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.089 region:rollup2

01:33:20.295 --> 01:33:24.599 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:25.567 region:rollup2
TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF LOS

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:28.069 region:rollup2
AND MAXIMIZE RATE RETURN.

01:33:25.567 --> 01:33:29.404 region:rollup2
UNLESS.

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:31.539 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES CLEARLY

01:33:29.404 --> 01:33:32.841 region:rollup2
PROVED NOT TO DO SO.

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:33.875 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS CONVERSATION

01:33:32.841 --> 01:33:35.143 region:rollup2
ALWAYS COMES BACK THAT PRUDENT

01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:36.244 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

01:33:35.143 --> 01:33:38.346 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES SET UP THE ARTISTIC

01:33:36.244 --> 01:33:39.981 region:rollup2
IS.

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:41.983 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OUR THINGS HAPPENING R.

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:42.550 region:rollup2
WE GET INTO A TIPPING POINT WITH

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:43.685 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO A CERTAIN TYPE OF

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:44.452 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:33:43.685 --> 01:33:45.553 region:rollup2
THERE IS LOOKING LIKE IT

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:47.889 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MAY BE PRUDENT TO

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:49.357 region:rollup2
DIVEST.

01:33:47.889 --> 01:33:50.091 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT POINT IF YOU THINK

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:51.426 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:51.960 region:rollup2
CUTTING THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY

01:33:51.426 --> 01:33:52.894 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION IS

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:54.295 region:rollup2

WELL SO REPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF

01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:23.404 region:rollup2
CHU BURPS APPROACH THAT MIGHT BE

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:24.405 region:rollup2

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:40.621 region:rollup2
GONNA ZERO IN ON SOME KEY

01:37:38.853 --> 01:37:41.189 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS THAT I BELIEVE HAVE

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:44.792 region:rollup2
HELPED US OVER THE YEARS. UP

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:46.294 region:rollup2
AND.

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:47.762 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE SORT OF

01:37:46.294 --> 01:37:48.396 region:rollup2
FOR BUCKETS ON TRANSPARENCY AND

01:37:47.762 --> 01:37:49.764 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS

01:37:48.396 --> 01:37:51.065 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEGISLATURE. YOU

PROCESS.

01:37:55.670 --> 01:37:59.006 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:37:57.205 --> 01:38:00.174 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT THE HISTORY OF TO

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:01.542 region:rollup2
BURP WHICH HAS NOW ALMOST

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:03.144 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:04.612 region:rollup2
THAT JR PURPOSE ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:38:03.144 --> 01:38:05.480 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE BUT A POLICE.

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:07.348 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY AND

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:08.349 region:rollup2
EXTINCTION.

01:38:07.348 --> 01:38:10.318 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA SPIEGEL ABOUT ABOUT

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:13.521 region:rollup2
THE VALUE OF HAVING MULTI

01:38:16.124 --> 01:38:20.495 region:rollup2
TO ASSASSIN AN OBJECTIVE R.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.995 region:rollup2
IMPARTIAL WAY IT REQUIRES THE

01:38:20.495 --> 01:38:22.997 region:rollup2
BEST REVIEW OF EVIDENCE

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:24.232 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:25.666 region:rollup2
I'M SURE BURKE HAS AN ADVISORY

BOARD THAT HAS HELPED TO DEVELOP

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:29.203 region:rollup2
METHODS.

01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:30.671 region:rollup2

PROCESS.

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:37.545 region:rollup2
IN THE SPEAK ABOUT THE

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:38.546 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING A

ALL IT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF

01:40:34.929 --> 01:40:37.331 region:rollup2
A VERY EXCITING TIME OF YEAR OUT

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:39.534 region:rollup2

OF COURSE GIVEN THE CYCLE.

01:40:47.575 --> 01:40:51.379 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY FALL CONCURRENTLY SO

01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:53.347 region:rollup2
IT'S A BIG PUSH ON BETWEEN NOW

01:40:51.379 --> 01:40:54.548 region:rollup2
AND MAY. THE COST FOR JR PURPOSE

01:40:53.347 --> 01:40:56.484 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A

01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:57.485 region:rollup2

DOZEN.

01:40:57.485 --> 01:41:00.755 region:rollup2
ANALYSES ARE IMPORTANT

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:02.423 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION ABOUT CHIPPER THESE

01:41:00.755 --> 01:41:04.725 region:rollup2
ARE NOT GENERAL FUND DOLLARS

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:06.460 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORT OUR WORK RATHER THE

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:08.429 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FUNDS EUROPE'S WORK

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.697 region:rollup2
THROUGH AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT. ON

HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS IN

01:41:09.697 --> 01:41:13.901 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:15.002 region:rollup2
I'M KEY TO OUR APPROACH INTO OUR

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:16.537 region:rollup2
WORK IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:18.005 region:rollup2
ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF AN

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:19.574 region:rollup2
ACTUARIAL MODEL OF HEALTH

01:41:18.005 --> 01:41:21.175 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:41:19.574 --> 01:41:23.177 region:rollup2
A MODEL THAT MUST BE ANNUALLY

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:25.246 region:rollup2
UPDATED TO ACCOMMODATE CHANGES

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:26.814 region:rollup2
THAT ARE LARGE LIKE WHEN THE

01:41:25.246 --> 01:41:28.616 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COMMENDABLE

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:30.351 region:rollup2
PLAY IN REALLY ALTERED OF THE

01:41:28.616 --> 01:41:31.819 region:rollup2
WEIGHT AND HEALTH INSURANCES.

01:41:30.351 --> 01:41:33.387 region:rollup2
FUNDED AND AND PROVIDED IN

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:34.021 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA OF COURSE BROUGHT

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:36.390 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE UNDER THE COVERAGE

01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:38.025 region:rollup2
TEN. AS WELL SMALLER CHANGES

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:39.593 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ONGOING CHANGES IN

01:41:38.025 --> 01:41:41.729 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION PATTERNS.

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:44.031 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT TRENDS MORE

01:41:41.729 --> 01:41:45.967 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS GOING TO SELF INSURED.

01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:47.435 region:rollup2
DRUGS IN AND SO FORTH.

01:41:45.967 --> 01:41:49.203 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE VERY HIGH LEVEL

01:41:47.435 --> 01:41:50.705 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW ANOTHER JUMP INTO

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:52.173 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY CREDIBILITY AND THE

01:41:50.705 --> 01:41:53.908 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS IN

01:41:52.173 --> 01:41:55.476 region:rollup2
OUR WORK. WOULD UNDERSCORE THAT

01:41:53.908 --> 01:41:56.978 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:58.679 region:rollup2
AND CREDIBILITY HAS BEEN

01:41:56.978 --> 01:41:59.547 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO WIN AND

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:02.116 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THE TRUST OF THE

01:41:59.547 --> 01:42:04.151 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SPONSORS ARE AND

01:42:02.116 --> 01:42:04.652 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGED

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:05.987 region:rollup2
IN THE TOPICS OF HEALTH

INSURANCE.

01:42:05.987 --> 01:42:09.123 region:rollup2
IT AS AS BEEN NOTED EARLIER

01:42:08.389 --> 01:42:10.825 region:rollup2
THESE ARE.

01:42:09.123 --> 01:42:12.393 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TOPICS THERE

01:42:10.825 --> 01:42:13.694 region:rollup2
EMOTIONALLY CHARGED I'M

01:42:12.393 --> 01:42:15.963 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THE EVIDENCE ISN'T SO

01:42:13.694 --> 01:42:18.265 region:rollup2
CLEAR CUT.

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:20.134 region:rollup2

SIX AND A HALF YEARS IT HAPPENED

01:42:51.699 --> 01:42:53.267 region:rollup2

PART OF THE PROCESS.

01:42:56.137 --> 01:42:59.840 region:rollup2
I'M KEY TO THE CREDIBILITY AND I

01:42:58.139 --> 01:43:01.676 region:rollup2

WELL KNOWN AND ESTABLISHED

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:08.482 region:rollup2
NEUTRALITY I REALLY THINK THAT'S

01:43:06.714 --> 01:43:09.383 region:rollup2
A VERY VERY KEY PIECE.

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:10.885 region:rollup2
YOUR BURKE MAKES NO

IS LIKELY TO DO ACTS AND WHY. AS

01:43:40.715 --> 01:43:43.350 region:rollup2
YOU ALL HAVE NO DOUBT EXPERIENCE

01:43:42.349 --> 01:43:44.652 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO

ACCOMPLISH

01:43:44.652 --> 01:43:48.322 region:rollup2
SUCH BASIC AGREEMENT I BELIEVE

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:49.724 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO.

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:52.993 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS ON WHETHER SUCH

01:43:49.724 --> 01:43:55.863 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES MAY BE WORTH THE COST.

ALONG WITH THE COURSE THE NUMBER

01:45:51.412 --> 01:45:54.048 region:rollup2

01:45:55.216 --> 01:45:58.519 region:rollup2

01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:35.689 region:rollup2
COULD BE EMPLOYED.

01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:37.791 region:rollup2
SETTING UP A PROGRAM LIKE THIS

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:39.460 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:40.895 region:rollup2
AND INVESTMENT ENSURING THAT A

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:42.563 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS RESPONSIVE AND

01:46:40.895 --> 01:46:43.731 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE IS CRITICAL BUT SO

01:46:42.563 --> 01:46:44.999 region:rollup2

01:55:19.613 --> 01:55:21.348 region:rollup2
END UP BEING PROFITABLE FOR

01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:22.849 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:55:21.348 --> 01:55:24.384 region:rollup2
ARE THEY ARE UNDERSTANDABLY

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:27.053 region:rollup2
DRAGGING THEIR FEET WHEN IT

01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:28.221 region:rollup2
COMES TO. ENGAGING IN OTHER

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:29.422 region:rollup2
LINES OF BUSINESS SUCH AS

01:55:28.221 --> 01:55:31.725 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE ENERGY.

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:33.927 region:rollup2
AND.

01:55:31.725 --> 01:55:36.430 region:rollup2
AS THEY DRAG THEIR FEET THEY ARE

01:55:33.927 --> 01:55:37.697 region:rollup2
SUBJECTING. OUR RETIREMENT FUNDS

01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:39.733 region:rollup2
I THINK TO REALLY SERIOUS

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:41.201 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL RISK.

01:55:39.733 --> 01:55:42.469 region:rollup2
THE RISKS ARE LEGAL WE'VE SEEN

01:55:41.201 --> 01:55:44.204 region:rollup2
LAWSUITS I THINK IT'S JUST

01:55:42.469 --> 01:55:45.806 region:rollup2
BEGINNING OF THOSE THE RISKS ARE

01:55:44.204 --> 01:55:48.275 region:rollup2
REGULATORY.

01:55:45.806 --> 01:55:49.910 region:rollup2
SO AT A VERY MINIMUM I URGE THE

01:55:48.275 --> 01:55:52.012 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO ESTABLISH A

01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:54.714 region:rollup2
MONITORING MECHANISM.

01:55:52.012 --> 01:55:56.683 region:rollup2
TO ASK OUR RETIREMENT FUNDS HOW

01:55:54.714 --> 01:55:59.586 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL ARE YOU.

01:55:56.683 --> 01:56:01.454 region:rollup2
AT GETTING.

01:55:59.586 --> 01:56:03.123 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT AND AT IT.

01:56:01.454 --> 01:56:05.725 region:rollup2
USING ENGAGEMENTS TO GET THE

01:56:03.123 --> 01:56:06.193 region:rollup2
FOSSIL FUEL FUND OUR COMPANIES.

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:07.794 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON

01:56:06.193 --> 01:56:09.696 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:10.764 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S ONE BIG FACT I THINK

01:56:09.696 --> 01:56:12.732 region:rollup2
THAT UNDERLINES THE IMPORTANCE

01:56:10.764 --> 01:56:14.100 region:rollup2
OF THAT.

01:56:12.732 --> 01:56:16.303 region:rollup2

THAT WE NEED TO BEND THE GLOBAL

01:56:38.091 --> 01:56:43.063 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS CURVE SHARPLY DOWNWARD

BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY.

01:56:43.063 --> 01:56:47.534 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR. OUR EMISSIONS WENT UP

01:56:45.432 --> 01:56:49.069 region:rollup2

PASSED S. B. FIVE SIXTY WITCHES

01:57:05.352 --> 01:57:11.091 region:rollup2
BEN ALLEN'S BILL THAT DEFINES

01:57:08.755 --> 01:57:14.427 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL BUT WERE NOW CAUGHT

01:57:11.091 --> 01:57:17.330 region:rollup2
CLIMATE. RELATED FINANCIAL RISK.

01:57:14.427 --> 01:57:18.798 region:rollup2
AND I'M HOPING THAT THAT BILL IS

01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:20.667 region:rollup2
GOING TO COME BACK WE'VE BEEN

01:57:18.798 --> 01:57:22.802 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING WITH CALPERS AND CAL

01:57:20.667 --> 01:57:24.504 region:rollup2
STIR SINCE THEN. BUT AS YOU

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:26.039 region:rollup2
PROBABLY KNOW THE OF.

01:57:24.504 --> 01:57:26.907 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IS

01:57:26.039 --> 01:57:28.542 region:rollup2
HOLDING ALL TWO YEAR BILLS.

01:57:26.907 --> 01:57:30.911 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:57:28.542 --> 01:57:32.045 region:rollup2
SINCE THAT TIME THE CONVERSATION

01:57:30.911 --> 01:57:32.846 region:rollup2
HAS CHANGED AND I THINK IT'S

01:57:32.045 --> 01:57:35.115 region:rollup2
CHANGED.

01:57:32.846 --> 01:57:36.850 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:57:35.115 --> 01:57:38.618 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THE PHYSICAL RISK HAS

01:57:36.850 --> 01:57:40.453 region:rollup2
BECOME SO MUCH MORE OBVIOUS

01:57:38.618 --> 01:57:42.322 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HER CANES.

01:57:40.453 --> 01:57:43.957 region:rollup2

01:57:45.091 --> 01:57:49.963 region:rollup2
BECOME.

01:57:47.427 --> 01:57:52.299 region:rollup2
I THINK PROBABLY ON A PAR WITH

01:57:49.963 --> 01:57:55.135 region:rollup2
STRANDED ASSET RISK.

01:57:52.299 --> 01:57:56.303 region:rollup2

01:57:58.104 --> 01:58:02.642 region:rollup2
WHY KEIRA HOLD THE THOUGHT AND

01:57:59.973 --> 01:58:04.044 region:rollup2
HOLD THE THOUGHT OF THIS BILL

01:58:02.642 --> 01:58:06.112 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES BACK BECAUSE? I

01:58:04.044 --> 01:58:09.015 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

01:58:06.112 --> 01:58:10.250 region:rollup2
BUT THE POINT OF.

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:12.218 region:rollup2
CODE OF FLYING.

01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:14.921 region:rollup2
THAT RISK

01:58:12.218 --> 01:58:17.157 region:rollup2
AND REQUIRING PENSION FUNDS

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:20.126 region:rollup2

01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:26.199 region:rollup2
IT'S A IT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING

01:58:25.632 --> 01:58:28.735 region:rollup2

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:31.371 region:rollup2
