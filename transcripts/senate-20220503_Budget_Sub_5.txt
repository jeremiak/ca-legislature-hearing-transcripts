YES GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR- ANNUALLY WITH THE L. A. L. COMMITTEE STAFF HAS ASKED US TO INTRODUCE THE ITEM AND PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION TO FRAME YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY. ANNOUNCED SENATE IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING POLLS TO INCREASE LEGAL AID ASSISTANCE INCLUDING ADDITIONAL LEGAL AID FUNDING FOR ADDICTION AND DEBT CONSUMER CASES AS WELL AS CREATING A LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM FOR LEGAL AID LAWYERS. AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA ONE MAJOR SOURCE OF STATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT LEGAL AID COMES THROUGH THE STATE'S EQUAL ACCESS PROGRAM THAT RECEIVES BOTH GENERAL FUND AND CIVIL FILING FEES SUPPORT. SO ONGOING FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM OR FIND WAS ABOUT TWENTY SIX MILLION IN TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN AND WILL BE ABOUT FORTY SIX MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. ON TOP OF THIS- SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LIMITED TERM FUNDING WAS ALSO PROVIDED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES SUCH AS FEDERAL FINES- SPECIFICALLY FOR- EVICTION CASES THREE THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED TO BE ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN TOTAL FORTY SIX MILLION AN ON GOING FUNDING AND TWENTY MILLION IN LIMITED TERM MONEY. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SELENA COPELAND FROM THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THIS COPELAND. MORNING ADAM CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CELINA COPELAND AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LEGALLY DISSOCIATION CALIFORNIA MY ORGANIZATION WAS FOUNDED SOON AFTER THIS LEGISLATURE CREATED THAT CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST ON LAWYER TRUST ACCOUNTS PROGRAM THE I ALSO PROGRAM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE FOR FORTY YEARS WE'VE WORKED WITH LEGAL AID PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE LEGISLATURE THE COURTS IN THE STATE BAR WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL AID ATTORNEY. FOR THE RECENTLY RELEASED NOT JUST GOT STUDY SHOWS THAT 74% OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCED. THE LEGAL PROBLEM IN A LOT. 92% OF THE INCOME. WITH THE SYSTEM. CIVIL LEGAL PROBLEMS DO NOT GET ANY OR ENOUGH LEGAL HELP. HEARING ASSIST INCLUDES MORE INFORMATION JUSTICE GOT STUDY BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TAKE AWAYS ARE THE MOST COMMON LEGAL CHALLENGES. FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. ANYWHERE CONSUMER ISSUES TO CONSUMER DEBT PROBLEM. I'M HEALTHCARE 39% OF HOUSEHOLDS HOW TO HELP YOUR PROBLEM INCOME MAINTENANCE THAT INCLUDES ACCESS TO PUBLIC BENEFITS 34% AND HOUSING THAT WAS 33% OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS AMERICA HAD A HOUSING PROBLEM. THE STUDY THE NATIONAL REFLECTS WHAT WE SEE HERE IN CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME PEOPLE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO PAY THEIR RENT. TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH ACCESS PUBLIC BENEFITS AND MANAGE CRUSHING PERSONAL DEBT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE ONE TIME INCREASE NICKEL ACCESS FROM LAST YEAR ISN'T IT IS MISLEAD SHARED HER REPORT HE WALKS AS FUN AS THE PRIMARY VEHICLE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO FIND LEGAL SERVICES TO THE POOR. THIS INCREASE WAS WELL TIMED ORGANISING. LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING TO OFFICES. WOULD NEVER END. NEEDING LEGAL BEFORE THE CADILLAC. I THE SAME TIME. THE INTEREST ON LAWYER TRUST ACCOUNT INTEREST RATES WERE REVENUE DROPPED. DUE TO THE CRASH IN THE INTEREST RATES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. WHAT IS YOUR TWO QUICK EXAMPLES OF HOW THE INCREASE IN FUNDING HAS BEEN YEARS. THE LOS ANGELES INTERLINE JUSTICE USE THEIR INCREASE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL IMMIGRATION SERVICES. TO SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IN ONE CASE THEY HELPED AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THERE YOU VISA. WHICH ALLOWED HER TO GET A WORK PERMIT. IMPORTANTLY HER NEW STATUS EXTENDED PROTECTIONS ARE FAMILY TO HER TWO PARENTS AND THREE SIBLINGS. AND NOW THERE'S AN ENTIRE FAMILY GAINING ELIGIBILITY FOR WORK AUTHORIZATION AND PROTECTION FROM REMOVAL AND FAMILY STABILITY DUE TO THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S BRAVE DECISION TO COME FORWARD. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW ORGANISED ARE USING INCREASE. IS PROPHETICALLY SERVICES MARTINEZ ENQUIRIES FOR LOW WAGE. REQUIREMENTS WITH UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ISSUES DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN RESPONSE BETTER DEVELOPED AN EXPERTISE AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. CLAIMS AND APPEALS. THERE'S NOT BEGIN CONDUCTING INTAKES I REALLY SCHEDULE CLINIC. IS STAFF OR NOT CONDUCTING INTAKES NOT ONLY ON THE REGULAR WAGE HOUR MATTERS. BUT ALSO HEALTH AND SAFETY AND UNEMPLOYMENT ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE CLINIC. WHICH RESULTED IN IN THEM INCREASING. THEIR CLINIC. MARCH OF. THEY RAN A ONCE IN. AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC THERE RUNNING THREE TIMES A WEEK. WHILE GRIPPING THE WAY OF LOS PROVIDED IN THIS FUNDING TO COVER THAT EXPANSION THAT WAS A ONE TIME CAPACITY GRANT FUNDING. AND THE ONLY WAY THE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT SERVICES THE SERVICES IS THROUGH THE INCREASE IN CLOCKS US FINE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE SPENDING IS STABLE WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ASKING TO CONTINUE THE ONE TIME INCREASE OF THIRTY MILLION FROM LAST YEAR. TO ONGOING HERE. AS YOU SEE IN STOCK ANALYSIS THE NEED IS STILL GREAT PARTICULARLY AS A RESULT OF THE LONG TERM FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF COVERAGE. AND WE NEED TO PRESERVE THESE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS. THERE IS A NEED. THE FUNDING HOUSING CONSUMER LEGAL SERVICES AS WELL AS YOUR NATIONAL JUSTICE GOT STUDY WHICH MATCHES WHAT WE HEAR IN THE COMMUNITY OR HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE THE CONTINUES TO BE A NEED TO INCREASE SERVICES FOR EVICTING DEFENSE AND TEN EDUCATION WE HAVE STARTED THE LEGALLY COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AN ORGANIZATION SAID THAT THEIR CURRENT FUNDING GAP FUNDING THEY COULD SPEND RIGHT AWAY TO INCREASE SERVICES WAS JUST OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A THREE YEAR GRANT AND THIS FIGURE DOES NOT INCLUDE WHAT THE NON LEGAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BELIEVE THEY CAN USE RIGHT AWAY TO EIGHT IN TEN OUTREACH AND EDUCATION EFFORTS IN PART. PRETTY NATIONAL JUSTICE A RESULT OF FOR THREE PER OF LOS RENT HOUSEHOLD EXPERIENCES OF CROSS LATEST MEETING SERVICES BEFORE HAVE A MASSIVE INCREASE HOUSING INSTABILITY IN OUR STATE AND AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF HOW ORGANIZATIONS ARE I'M DOING HOUSING LEGAL SERVICES FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSISTANCE. THE MULTIPLE TENANTS WERE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN ONE CASE THEY HAVE TO TENANTS WHO'VE BEEN UNLAWFULLY LOCKED OUT OF HER HOME AFTER THE LANDLORD APARTMENT COMPLEX EVICTED HER ON THE BASIS OF THE DOMESTIC BOX INSTEAD INCIDENT. WITH HER MUSIC WAS SENTENCED TO TEN YEARS. EARLY GOT A DEFAULT JUDGMENT SET ASIDE AND IT WAS ABLE TO RETURN HOME. SO THE TENANT AND HER FOR MINOR CHILDREN REMAIN HOUSE TODAY. HOW MANY EXAMPLES WHICH I CAN SHARE WITH BUDGET STAFF WERE CIVIL WHERE LEGALLY PROBLEM HAD TO STEP LEGAL AID PROGRAM HAD TO STEP IN AND ENFORCE THE EVICTION PROTECTION RIGHTS. THAT YOU CREATED DURING THE COVER NINETEEN CONDEMNING. WE'RE EVEN LOCAL COURTS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR OBLIGATION TO STOP LOCKOUTS WHEN EMERGENCY RENTAL PROGRAM APPLICATION HAS BEEN APPROVED. TURNING VERY BRIEFLY TO CONSUMER DEBT ISSUES THE LARGEST NEED IN THE NATIONAL STUDY. IN ORDER TO HELP PEOPLE FINANCIALLY IMPACTED BY JOB LOSS INCREASED DEBT WE NEED DEDICATED MULTI YEAR FUNDING TO ENCOURAGE THE CREATION AND EXPANSION. OF CONSUMER DEBT. LEGAL SERVICES A LEGAL AID ORGANIZATION. WITH ALLOCATION. IN ONE TIME FUNDING OVER THREE YEARS IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO INCUBATE THIS PROGRAM IN CRITICAL CORPORATE LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE CAN HELP PEOPLE NAVIGATE CHALLENGING MEDICAL DEBT AND CREDIT CARD DEBT. THAT LARGELY CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF CODE RELATED JOB LOSS. ON WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SPEND GRANT G. MENTAL ADVOCACY SERVICES USED THEIR EQUAL ACCESS FUND GRANT TO FUND A CONSUMER FINANCE PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES. THE PROGRAMS ARE CONCERTS CLIENTS WHO DO CREDIT REPORTING ERRORS HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING WORK AND IT DIFFICULTY SECURING HOPPING. THEY ALSO HELP COMBAT FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION AND STANDS. IN HOUSING DEDICATED FUNDING OR. CONTINUE AND EXPAND THIS WORK. NOT JUST ONE LAST CONSUMER EXAMPLE. FROM COMMUNITY LEE AID SO WOULD YOU AND ONCE LOS CA. MEDICAL WAS COURSE INTO K. HER YOU SUPPOSE. JUST SEVERAL GOOD. WERE SHE WAS ORDERED TO PURCHASE HANDGUNS RIFLES AND AMMUNITIONS WITH HER CREDIT CARD. AFTER THE PURCHASES WHICH TOTALED SIX SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS SHE FOUND HERSELF WITH A DEAD SHE COULDN'T HANDLE AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY SUIT. TAKING THE CASE COMMUNITY LEGAL AID SOMEHOW ATTORNEY ARGUED THAT THE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS COERCED DEBT. CITING HER ABUSIVE HUSBANDS BEHAVIOR. PROVIDE IMPROVED OPPOSING COUNSEL HOW MUCH YOUR BEFORE THE- OF THE GUNS AND HISTORY HER USE OF THE CREDIT CARD AND HER GOOD PAYMENTS. IT'S THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER. THE CARD AND THE UNUSUAL SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS CHARGE. THANKFULLY THE CASE WAS SETTLED FOR JUST ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS WHAT SHE OR PRIOR TO THE GUN PURCHASES. AND THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY ALLOWED HER TO PAY OFF THE SETTLEMENT BE BE A MONTHLY PAYMENTS ONLY EIGHTY SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH. THE CLIENT WHO HAS FILED FOR DIVORCE PRESENTLY LIVES ON HER OWN AND HAS CUSTODY OF HER DAUGHTERS. SO ALL THESE INCREASES LEGALLY FUNDING MAKE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THE LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS CAN ACCOMPLISH FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. WITH THE INVESTMENTS TO START ABOUT. IT ORGANIZATIONS CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN OUR COMMUNITY AND A CONTACT. NUMBER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUST GO. VERY MUCH. THAT WAS VERY INSIDE. ON AN ABI VERY. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON OUT THERE AS FAR AS LEGAL SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED. ON NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JACK LONDON FROM THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO JUSTICE COMMISSION. THANK YOU CENTER MY NAME IS JACK LONDON. I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO JUSTICE COMMISSION. LAST YEAR YOU APPROPRIATED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR US TO MAKE INFRASTRUCTURE AND INNOVATION GRANTS TO LEGAL AID NON PROFITS DOLLARS IN REQUESTS. WE'RE ABLE TO AWARD FORTY SEVEN GRANTS TO PROGRAM STRUCK CALIFORNIA THIRTY TWO FOUR RURAL COMMUNITIES THIRTY SIX TO SERVE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. TWENTY FOUR TO FORM PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ARE RAMPS SHOULD CONTINUE AND IF POSSIBLE THEY SHOULD INCREASE. OUR INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS ALLOW MANY LEGAL AND NON PROFITS TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY FOR REMOTE SERVICES TO CLARK'S. TO PROVIDE MULTI LANGUAGE ONLINE SERVICES AND UPDATE OBSOLETE SYSTEMS. LET ME GIVE YOU THREE WE GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF INNOVATION. NEIGHBORHOOD LEGAL SERVICES OF L. A. COUNTY AND THREE PARTNERS ARE DEVELOPING A NEW SYSTEM THAT USES TACTIC. TO GET CLIENT FEEDBACK AND ASSESSMENTS OF CASE OUTCOMES AND IMPACT. OUR MOST CLIENTS HAVE CELL PHONES AND IT TURNS OUT THE RATES OF PARTICIPATION ARE VERY HIGH. THIS WILL GIVE US EXTREMELY VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT SERVICES WORK BEST FOR CLIENTS. ANOTHER INNOVATION IS BY VETERANS LEGAL INSTITUTE IT'S CREATING A LIBRARY OF KNOW YOUR RIGHTS VIDEOS FOR VETERANS ON SEVERAL AREAS OF LAWS WITH SPECIAL PROTECTIONS. THIS IS MONEY WELL SPENT AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT WE'LL CONTINUE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF POSSIBLE INCREASE. BUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER- NEED. AND THAT IS. THERE IS A CRISIS IN RECRUITING AND RETAINING LAWYERS FOR LEGAL AID NON PROFITS AND HELPFUL. RIGHT NOW THERE IS ONE LEGAL AID LAWYER FOR EVERY SEVEN THOUSAND. ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. WHAT'S WORSE R. A RECENT ABA SURVEY SHOWED THAT ONE THIRD OF LAWYERS EMPLOYED AT LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS LEFT THEIR JOBS EVERY TWO WEEKS. AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE CURRENT TIGHT JOB MARKET. LOW PAY AND HIGH STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WITH THE MAIN RESULTS WE PROPOSE THAT THE STATE SHOULD PROVIDE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTINUING ANNUAL FUNDING FOR A STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR LAWYERS WHO SERVE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHILE WORKING AT LEGAL AID NON PROFITS BARRIER TO DIVERSITY IN LEGAL AID LGAL AID LAWYERS SHOULD REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I'D LIKE TO KNOW AND BLACK LAW STUDENTS HAVE TO BORROW MORE FOR THEIR EDUCATION THEIR LOAN BALANCES ARE 20% OR MORE HIGHER. THAN ONE STUDENTS LAW STUDENTS ACCORDING Y. LAS STUDENTS ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION. WITH CONTINUING FUNDING OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. MOST IF NOT ALL STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA LEGAL AID LAWYERS COULD BE COVERED FOR AS LONG AS THEY REMAIN IN LEGAL AID JOCKS. THE BENEFITS WOULD BE STRUCTURED ON A TAX EXEMPT BASIS. IT WOULD NOT BE TAXED FOR THE BENEFIT THEY RECEIVED THIS MAKES THAT IT MF VERY EFFICIENT USE OF THE MONEY. IT WOULD BE A POWERFUL SUPPORT FOR RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND WOULD MAKE POSSIBLE A MORE DIVERSE LEGAL AID WORKER FORCE. I STAY IN LEGAL AID FOR TEN YEARS LAWYERS CAN ALSO GET PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ACCESS COMMISSION IS PROVIDING THIS YEAR TRAINING FOR LAWYERS ABOUT HOW TO QUALIFY FOR THE NEWLY REDESIGNED PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM M. FOR HOW TO GO BACK AND CORRECT- DOCUMENTATION PROBLEMS IN THE PAST. THIS IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM BUT IT WORKS HAND IN HAND WITH THE POWER PROPOSED LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM WITH PAYMENT PROGRAM WILL COVER HER. LOAN PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WHILE LAWYERS STAY IN THEIR LEGAL AID JOBS IT'S A POWERFUL TOOL FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION THE CITIZENSHIP USE OF THE MONEY. AND IF WHERE IS STABLE AID JOBS FOR TEN YEARS THE LOAN REPAYMENT THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WILL QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL. LOAN FORGIVENESS AS WELL SO THEIR BALANCE WILL GO AWAY AFTER TEN YEARS. AND THEIR PAYMENTS WILL BE COVERED. THIS IS HOW NEED IT'S A- EFFICIENT. WE HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER LONDON GREAT GREAT EXAMPLES- THAT MAKES IT PRETTY CLEAR CRYSTAL CLEAR HERE. OF WILL WILL COME BACK FOR A QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I HAVE A COUPLE OF. QUESTIONS- YOU BOTH GAVE- MISTER LONDON AND MISS COPLAND YOU BOTH GAVE REALLY GREAT EXAMPLES OF HOW. WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH CONSUMER DEBT AND THE NEED FOR- AND ACTUALLY MENTIONED A NUMBER OF AREAS WERE THAT HAVE LED TO LEGAL PROBLEMS. AND OF COURSE THE NEED TO HIRE AND RETAIN- LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS. WITH REGARDS TO OF- THE LEGAL OF. LET'S SEE THE CONSUMER OF DEBT THAT'S DO YOU SEE THAT THAT IS THERE ANY PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS THAT OF CONSUMER DEBT- ANY BIG SHOULDN'T CASES- DO YOU SEE IT- CHANGING- YOU KNOW AS WE RETURN TO QUOTE UNQUOTE MORE AND MORE NORMAL ANA WHAT WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF HOW IT'S MOVING AND INTO THIS NEW PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC. MAY BE MISSED COPELAND BOTH OF YOU MS COPELAND YOU COULD START. IT HAPPENS HERE AND- ALSO BELIEVE TEMPERAMENT HE'S LATER ON THE AGENDA WILL HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THIS AS WELL. WHEN I THINK. ESPECIALLY IN IN CASES OF CONSUMER DEBT LEGAL SERVICES AND EVICTION PREVENTION AND CONVICTION AND CONTAIN EDUCATION ISSUES NOW IT'S JUST A CRITICAL TIME BECAUSE OF CODE RELATED JOB LOSS I THINK THAT WE MAY SEE AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IMPACTS PEOPLE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. BUT NOW I JUST FEEL THAT ESPECIALLY UNPRECEDENTED SO MANY HOUSEHOLDS ARE IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE RENTER HOUSEHOLDS WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR RENT FOR TIME AND EVERYONE STILL KIND OF. DIG THEMSELVES OUT OF WHAT WE SAW IN PRIOR DISASTERS MAKING HURRICANES AND TORNADOES AND FLOODS WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO BORROW FROM FAMILIES OR FROM FRIENDS OR BEING ABLE TO TEMPORARILY USE CREDIT CARDS. BUT WHEN SO MUCH OF OUR SOCIETY IS IMPACTED ESPECIALLY LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIA'S ARE IMPACTED BY THIS THE EXHAUST WHILE THE OTHER RESOURCES SO I THINK WE PROBABLY WILL SEE A LONG TAIL OF THESE ISSUES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AND HOPEFULLY AS WE RECOVER- MAYBE THAT WOULD NOT BE MORE PROTECTIONS THAT YOU CREATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN PROTECT PEOPLE IN THE LONGER RUN. I THINK THIS IS NOT IT IS A ONE TIME NEED. IT'S NOT GONNA BE OVER NEXT YEAR. YEAH ANY THOUGHTS LEARNED. THANKS THANK YOU CENTER I'M GONNA USE A STYLUS. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR YOU. I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS TO MR RAHMAN AND OTHERS WHO WILL SPEAK TO WORK ON CAN YOU THAT OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN- I THINK MR- LONDON YOU DID TALK ABOUT THE- ATTORNEYS HE SAID I THINK YOU SAID SOMETHING LIKE A THIRD OF ATTORNEYS HAVE LEFT. AND YOU ATTRIBUTED. TO COLLEGE DEBT AND ONE OTHER ITEM THAT I DIDN'T CATCH. WELL PAY SENATOR WE DID A SURVEY WITH THE STATE BAR LAST YEAR AND FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE LEGAL AID SALARY AT ANY. LEVEL OF SENIORITY IS AT LEAST TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS LOWER THAN THE BOTTOM OF THE RANGE OF GOVERNMENT ATTORNEYS WORKING FOR STATE LEVEL OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHICH IS THE MOST COMPARABLE LEVEL. THIS IS EVEN LOWER EVEN GREATER GAP BELOW OUR PRIVATE SECTOR ATTORNEYS. OKAY M. THE BURDEN OF ON AVERAGE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN LOAN PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WHAT THOSE TOGETHER AND SOMEONE LIVING IN LOS ANGELES IS ONLY ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. LOVE THE MINIMUM POVERTY LEVEL- INCOME TO COVER BASIC EXPENSES AFTER TAXES ALONG BATES YOU CAN MAKE UP MORE THAN 10% INCREASE IN THE DISPOSABLE INCOME OF LEGAL AID LAWYERS. ARE TAX EXEMPT BASIS SERVICE PROGRAM. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND ESPECIALLY THE- OF THE SERVICES OF THESE LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS BECAUSE FRANKLY WITHOUT THEM FAR MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE AFFECTED FAR MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE LIVING IN CROWDED- CONDITIONS- MORE PEOPLE WOULD END UP ON HOUSED I MEAN THEY ARE. SAVING US FROM HAVING TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON ALL THESE OTHER KINDS OF SERVICES BECAUSE IT WOULD OF THOSE FAMILIES WOULD BE IN A WORSE SITUATION SO ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- SENATORS COMMENTS QUESTIONS CENTER NEWMAN- YOU'RE ON IT IT'S PROBABLY A QUESTION FOR MR LEAP. TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE WE'RE WE'RE CONSIDERING- ANOTHER ONE TIME ALLOCATION FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- AGAINST LAST YEAR'S WINTER BUDGET SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR FROM DISCUSSION HERE THAT THESE ARE ONGOING NEEDS- IT'D THE ANNOUNCES WE GOT ALSO NOTES THERE WERE SOME HARPER FUNDS THAT WERE- PROVIDING ON A ON A THREE YEAR BASIS SO AS FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS WHAT WHAT'S LEFT. FOR THIS YEAR AND I SEEM NEXT YEAR OF THE ORP OF FUNDS. AND WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF THE ONGOING NEED- IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRST QUESTION- SO FROM THE FEDERAL OUR CURRENT CURRENT MY WRISTS FISCAL RELIEF FUNDS- IT WAS SPREAD ACROSS THREE YEARS. SO THERE WAS ABOUT FORTY MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THERE'S TWENTY MILLION AND THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THERE IS THE FINAL TWENTY MILLION AND SO THEN THAT MONEY. WILL BE GONE- AS AS AS- AS YOU REFERENCED- SO IT'S HELPFUL AGAIN SO IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE WHAT IS CURRENTLY. IN AN ONGOING IN COMBINATION FROM THE GENERAL FUND AS WELL AS FROM CIVIL FILING FEES AND THEN THAT TWENTY MILLION AND FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT'S KIND OF WHAT'S THERE. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT SO IT TOOK THAT IT SOUNDS AS IF WERE- CERTAIN POSITION PLUS MAKE ANOTHER ONE TIME ALLOCATION AGAINST THE NEED THIS YEAR- WHICH IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING BUT YOU KNOW I DO GET CONCERNED. CECI LOOKING OUT AT THE END OF THE FISCAL ENVIRONMENT AND NOW YEARS IN THE ABSENCE OF A SURPLUS WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME. DIFFICULT CHOICES- SHOWED EACH SHOULD THIS BE A LARGER ON GOING ALLOCATION MOVING FORWARD OR IS THERE A SENSE THAT THE NEED WILL DECREASE AS THE EFFECTS OF A PANDEMIC- START TO. SUBSIDE THE LEGISLATURE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN- EVALUATING IT AS PART OF YOUR BROADER. GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES- SO TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- IN. BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THERE WAS AN AUGMENTATION- THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET TWENTY MILLION OF THAT WAS ON GOING THIRTY MILLION OF THAT. WAS ONE TIME- THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT MS COPELAND ACTUALLY MENTIONED THAT THAT'S THIRTY MILLION. A ONE TIME AND SO THE TWENTY MILLION ONGOING- IS EFFECTIVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND WILL CONTINUE ON THE LEGISLATURE IF IT IS A PRIORITY CERTAINLY CAN ADD ADDITIONAL PLANS WHETHER IT BE ON A LIMITED TERM OR AN ON GOING BASIS. AND JUST TO CLOSE THIS OUT I GUESS FROM MS COPELAND NINETY WHAT'S YOUR SENSES OF HOW FAR WILL THAT. ONGOING ALLOCATION MAKE US IN AN INSTANT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. A LARGER ALLOCATION WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED ON ON GOING BASIS. I MEAN FOR THE LEGAL AID PROGRAMS IN YOUR DISTRICT WOULD APPRECIATE ONGOING ALLOCATION BUT I KNOW THE REALITY OF THE PROJECT THAT ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS ARE EASIER TO MANAGE AND THAT- WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS TO BE ABLE TO HIRE. INTO HIGHER STAFF ATTORNEYS AND OTHER ADVOCATES FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS RATHER THAN TEMPORARY HIRES IS MULTI YEAR FUNDING. ON GO ON GOING FUNDING IS IDEAL OF COURSE THAT MULTI YEAR ONE TIME FUNDING IS ALSO COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE BECAUSE ORGANIZATIONS CAN HIRE. I'M IN THERE IS A WRINKLE THAT I THINK MAY HAVE BEEN MENTIONED- LAST YEAR WE DISCUSSED THIS AND I THINK IT MAY ALSO BE MADE ALISTAIR. IS I ALSO. COUNT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DROP. AVENUE AS SOON AS THAT THAT KIND OF OUR SKIN A CAT IN TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE INTEREST RATES DROP SO MUCH RESIDE DECREASE OF I THINK APPROXIMATELY APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILLION PER YEAR. IN REVENUE AND THAT MONEY WENT DIRECTLY TO LEGAL AID PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND AS INTEREST RATES IMPROVE WE WILL SEE THAT THAT AMOUNT SLOWLY INCREASING AGAIN. IT'S JUST GONNA BE QUITE A WHILE AND SO I DON'T INTEREST RATES IMPROVE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO PRIOR- REVENUE I BELIEVE WE HAD ROUGHLY FIFTEEN MILLION IN REVENUE. IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND. IT'S JUST REALLY TAKES THEM. RICHARD YOU. THANK YOU- WE HAVE A UP- FROM MISS MURRAY FROM THE CALL LAW IN CONCUR COALITION I KNOW YOU SCHEDULED TO- SPEAK ON THE NEXT ISSUE BUT IF YOU WANT TO JUMP IN HERE. JUST BRIEFLY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE I WITH SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR- THERE IS A- RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE TALE- THE ONGOING EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AND HOW LONG- THESE THESE THESE NEEDS WILL BE WITH US- WE HAVE AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BACK RENT YET NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. IN IN THE STATE WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT- BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE A VAST NEED FOR FOUR TOURNEY'S LEGAL AID ATTORNEY TO HELP LOW INCOME TENANTS WITH. THE COLLECTION OF THOSE MONIES AND THAT WILL LAST FOR YEARS. THANK YOU. I MEAN IT DOES SEEM THAT THE INVESTMENT IN HIRING AND RETAINING ESPECIALLY RETAINING ATTORNEYS IS REALLY AT THE HEART OF ALL OF THIS BECAUSE WITHOUT THOSE ATTORNEYS. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES OF EVICTION THE ISSUES OF CONSUMER DEBT. AND IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT SO SOMEHOW I THINK THAT SHOULD- PLAY A- BIG PART IN FIGURING OUT THE- THE BUDGET. SENATOR CORTEZ THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN IN IN IN- FROM- FROM MY LOCAL EXPERIENCE IN IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES INCLUDING IMMIGRATION ISSUES WERE THE COUNTY. WANTED TO EITHER PASS THROUGH STATE OR FEDERAL MONEY OR JUST USES ON GENERAL FUND. TO INCREASE- THIS KIND OF CAPACITY. OF MORE THINGS WE LEARNED WAS TO ESSENTIALLY DISPROPORTIONATELY FOCUS THE ASSISTANCE IN TWO. ATTORNEYS WHO COULD FUNCTION IN A SUPERVISORY CAPACITY LONG TERM BECAUSE THE TURNOVER WE COULD NEVER SEEM TO STOP THAT. IN THE CASES WOULD. YOU KNOW MOVE ALONG- SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE MONTHS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN- THE COUNSEL OF RECORD WOULD BE GONE IN IT JUST CREATED A VERY CHALLENGING DISCUSS YOUR ATTENTION COMMENTED VERY CHALLENGING SITUATION- YOU KNOW FOR THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE LOG NO TO. YOU KNOW ALL OF A SUDDEN GO IN IN IN IN START TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE JUDGE OR MAGISTRATE THAT. THE ATTORNEY OF RECORD IS NO LONGER THERE IT'S DISRUPTIVE TO THE- OBVIOUSLY TO THE CLIENT. AND YOU KNOW JUST IS AN EFFICIENT IN GENERAL SO. YOU KNOW. I I'M FOR THIS- BUT I CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE- THE PROPONENTS TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT KIND OF AN APPROACH WHERE YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN'T BRING EVERYBODY UP ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF- COMPETITIVENESS AND RETENTION. AT LEAST BRING UP. A COHORT OF MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP FOLKS WHO WHO CAN THEN STEP IN IF YOU LOSE AN ATTORNEY THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THAT BECAUSE WELL. THAT SUPERVISORY ATTORNEY IS STAYING CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE CASE TO BE ABLE TO STEP IN AND KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING AND KEEP THE REPRESENTATION EFFECTIVE SO JUST MY THOUGHTS ARE. IT'S DEFINITELY A BIG ISSUE IN ANY DOLLARS ARE GOOD DOLLARS ALTHOUGH I AGREE WITH. SENATOR NEWMAN THAT IF YOU KNOW BUT WE'RE IN OLD OF. ADVOCATING FOR ONE TIME ON. THIS YEAR FOR ONGOING NEEDS AND I THINK IT'S STARTING TO SCARE SOME OF US AS TO WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN THE BOTTOM FALLS OUT A LITTLE BIT IN A COUPLE YEARS AND- YOU KNOW CLIENTS IN A SAFETY NET RECIPIENTS JUST. IN ALL OF A SUDDEN ARE- YOU KNOW NOT GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED- YOU KNOW THROUGH NO FAULT OF ANYONE OTHER THAN THIS THE SYSTEM OF ONE TIME VERSUS ONGOING MONEY. THANK YOU ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR CALLING Q. I JUST AND I REALLY. APPRECIATE MS COPELAND MISTER LONDON AND PARTICULARLY MYSTICAL PLAN WHEN YOU I THINK IT WAS YOU WHO SAID- THERE'S A- THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL CASES AND IN THE PAST YOU HAD INDIVIDUAL CASES BUT- SOMEHOW YOU CAN REACH OUT TO A FAMILY MEMBER TO A NEIGHBOR. THE SOMEONE TO HELP BUT IF EVER IN THE SAME BOAT EVERYBODY'S IN TROUBLE EVERYBODY HAS DEBT WHERE DO YOU GO AND WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY YOU ABSOLUTELY WILL END UP. ON HOUSE OR WORSE WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE COULD COULD BE HAPPENING AND THEN WERE. CHASING THAT PROBLEM. INSTEAD OF THINKING IN ADVANCE SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT THAT YOU WON AND WITH MYSTICAL BLENDER MISTER LONDON. BEFORE WE MOVE ON THE NEXT ISSUE. WELL I HAD ONE OTHER EXAMPLE WHICH I'VE I'VE DONE SHARED WITH WITH THANKS SENATE STAFF. OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS A WOMAN WHO HAD MULTIPLE THREATS AGAINST HER AND BECAUSE SHE WAS ACTUALLY ON HOW SHE WAS JUDGMENT CREW. AND SO SHE WAS UNABLE TO PAY THOSE DEBTS. AND EVEN THOUGH SHE OULD NEVER BE ABLE TO PAY THOSE DEBTS THE FACT IT WAS ON HER RECORD WAS A BARRIER TO HOUSING SHE WAS TRYING TO GET IN IN SECTION EIGHT HOUSING. IS A WORKING WITH ILLEGALLY PROGRAM THEY WORKED WITH THE LENDER AND ACTUALLY. TO REMOVE THE DEBT FOR HER RECORD AND SHE WAS ABLE TO THE HOUSE SO YOU MAY THINK THAT CONSUMER DEBT- JUST IMPACT YOUR CREDIT RECORD BEING POSSIBILITY TO GET WORK TO GET HOUSING. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A LAWYER WHO CAN HELP THEY CAN GET AT THE ROOT ISSUE. HOPEFULLY SOLVE THAT ONE PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME GIVE ONE MORE EXAMPLE THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU GREAT EXAMPLE MISTER LONDON ANY FINAL WORDS. JUSTICE CENTER MILLIONS GOVERNMENT IS RIGHT AND- CONTINUING FUNDING FOR CONTINUING NEEDS IS A PROGRAM. FOR RETAINING LAWYERS IT'S ESPECIALLY NECESSARY NOW MULTI YEAR CONTINUING. OUR FUNDING BECAUSE- IN ORDER TO GET TO BE A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY AS CENTER CONTAINS A POINTED OUT. YOU NEED TO HAVE A CAREER OF. FIVE OR SIX YEARS. AT LEAST YEAH- WEARS A SMART PEOPLE AND HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR- PROSPECTS ARE. HAVING IN MIND WHETHER. THIS IS A ONE TIME- PROGRAM MORE SO THAT THEY COUNT ON THE FUTURE MUCH- UP ALL THE WORK YOU DO A THE SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS ARE OUT THERE- HELP IN OUR COMMUNITY. THANKYOU ABOUT WILL MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE TO THE COURT FILING FEES- A WILL START WITH THE L. A. L. IS THAT MISLI. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- COMMITTEE STAFF HAS ASKED US TO INTRODUCED THIS ITEM. THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE INCOME THRESHOLD FOR AUTOMATIC FILING FEE WAIVERS IN CIVIL CASES. THESE WAIVERS ARE CURRENTLY GRANTED TO INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES BELOW A HUNDRED AND THRESHOLD. AND OR CERTAIN TYPES OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. TO REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S COST OF LIVING THE PROPOSAL THE SENATE IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING WOULD CONSIDER RAISING THE THRESHOLD BASED ON CALIFORNIA INCOME AND STAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO HEAR NOW FROM- MR MERMAN TED MERMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D MISS OUT EVEN IF THE MAKE- FROM- THE COMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES EAST PALO ALTO IS GONNA GO FIRST I'LL BE. AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. NINETY THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS VANESSA NIET AND I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY COMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST PALO ALTO WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB THREE FIVE FIVE WHICH IS AUTHORED BY SENATOR BACKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. IS THE PROBLEM. WANT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST CIVIL LAWSUITS MUST PAY SUBSTANTIAL FILING FEES IF THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR A FEE WAIVER. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIANS ONLY QUALIFY FOR MEMBERS AUTOMATICALLY IF THEY RECEIVE FIRST CERTAIN BENEFITS. OR SECOND THEIR INCOME IS UNDER A GUIDELINES. IF A PERSON CAN'T PAY THE FILING FEE. WHICH MAY RUN TO HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS THEY MAY NEVER RESPOND TO PERHAPS AMERICA'S DEBT COLLECTION LAWSUITS. THAT MEANS THE BANK ACCOUNT MAYBE LEVY. THEIR WAGES MAY BE GARNISHED EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY FOR THE MONEY THAT THEY WERE SUED FOR. I PROPOSED IS THREE FIVE FIVE AND THE CORRESPONDING ENHANCEMENTS IF WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE A FILING FEE WAIVER WE EXPAND ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND WE WERE JUST A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER RESPOND TO LAWSUITS AND HAVE THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR FOOD. OR TO STAY HOUSE THREATENED AS A RESULT. CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE WORDS EXCESSIVE TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES YEAR. OTHERWISE MIGHT NEVER HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN WE'RE SPEAKING A BUDGET ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL PROVIDE MORE TRUST IS TO MORE PEOPLE. FOR MAKING SURE THAT OUR COURTS ARE FUNDED TO COVER ANY REDUCTION IN REVENUE RESULTING FROM WORK HIGHLY REVERSE. TO MAKE IT CLEAR AND LIKE TO SHARE STORY. JOHN WILSON IS AN ELDERLY RETIRED MAN WHO'S A VICTIM OF IDENTITY FAST. THE IDENTITY THIEF FRAUDULENTLY ENCOURAGED THAT MR WILSON'S NAME. BUT MR WILSON WAS SUED BY THE DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY TO RECOVER THE MONEY HE TRIED TO FILE A MOTION TO STOP THE COLLECTION OF THE DAY. BUT BEFORE HE COULD FILE THE MOTION MISTER WILSON NEEDED TO PAY A FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR FILING FEE TO THE COURT. THIS IS SOMETHING HE COULD NOT DO. MISTER WILSON LIVES IN A MONTHLY FIXED INCOME OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM HIS PENSION AND HAS RENT STABILIZED HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO. BUT HE DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY FOR THE WAIVER. UNDER THE NEW GUIDELINES WE PROPOSED TODAY MISTER WILSON WHAT QUALIFY FOR THE WAIVER AUTOMATICALLY. AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT HE EXPERIENCE COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. PAYING OUT OF POCKET FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN BOUNTIES CAN BE ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE WHEN A PERSON IS SURVIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. AS A RESULT MANY MERITLESS CASES STILL AND IN A DEFAULT JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFF. WITH POTENTIALLY DIRE LONG TERM FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE SHOWED STUDIES CONSISTENTLY FOUND THAT ALMOST HALF OF AMERICANS WOULD HAVE TROUBLE PICKING EMERGENCY EXPENSE. OF FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER CONTACT THE INITIAL FILING FEE AND AN UNLIMITED CIVIL CASE IN CALIFORNIA IS NOW FOR HER THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS. THIS BUDGET ENHANCEMENT WILL MODERNIZE THE INCOMES INTERPERSONAL FILING FEE WAIVERS REDUCE JUDICIAL TIME AND RESOURCES AND FUND THE COURTS. ARE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR LOGAN. CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MERMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THAT HAD NORMAN DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION I JUST SAY I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE MISS NIGHT BECAUSE THAT POIGNANTLY I THINK LAID OUT THE NEED FOR THIS BUDGET ITEM- WE DO NOT WANT AS A STATE TO BE DEPRIVING OUR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS OF THEIR ABILITY TO FIGHT UNJUST DEBT COLLECTION OR TO KEEP THEIR HOMES. IN THE FACE OF A FORECLOSURE OR EVICTION LAWSUITS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE FILING FEES NEEDED TO RESPOND- I WANT TO ADD THAT WE APPRECIATED THE INPUT F THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO PUTTING IN PLACE A BUDGETARY REGIME THIS YEAR THAT COVERS ANY POTENTIAL LOSS OF REVENUE FROM THE INCREASE IN FEE WAIVERS. I'M OF COURSE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU. OKAY WILL NOW MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS- I HAVE ONE- WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR APPLYING FOR A FEE WAIVER IF YOU DON'T MEET THE AUTOMATIC. REQUIREMENT IS THERE PROCESS FOR THAT. YES IF YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE AUTOMATIC FEE WAIVER YOU CAN FILL OUT F. W. O. ONE. AND YOU CAN PRESENT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR INCOME YOUR RENT YOUR MONTHLY GROCERY PAYMENTS MEDICAL CAR INSURANCE ETCETERA TO SHOW HOW MUCH YOU HAVE LEFT OVER. AND YOUR INABILITY TO PAY HOWEVER OUR CLIENTS CONSISTENTLY STATE THAT THIS IS HUMILIATING FOR THEM TO HAVE TO PROVE INSURGENCY. AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO USE THAT FORM DO I QUALIFY BUT IT DOES TAKE JUDICIAL TIME AND RESOURCES TO ENSURE TO KEEP THOSE BEING REVERSED WHEN THEY COULD BE AUTOMATICALLY GRANTED. THANK YOU. OF MEMBERS SENATE CRITICIZING. YOUR JUSTICE- ONE OF A TECHNICAL QUESTION HERE THE INDEXING TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY THRESHOLD IS WITH. IS THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSION TO MAKE THAT THE ADJUSTED OF. THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE I'M LOOKING IN THE- OUR PACKET NOTES WHICH INDICATED ON PAGE FOUR- FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOR FAMILY OF FOUR BEING. THE FEDERAL PARTY TOLD WHICH IS ACTUALLY. ADJUSTED TO WELL OVER SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AS I RECALL IN IN MY COUNTY SOME I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT'S- BEEN CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE FRAMEWORK. TONY BY COUNTY INDEXING I DON'T KNOW. WHO WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO TOSS A QUESTION TOO I'M SORRY. FOR WHO WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THAT. I AM HAPPY TO START WE ARE CONSIDERED COUNTY BY COUNTY INDEXING FOR AREA MEDIAN INCOMES. ARE PROVISIONAL COUNCIL RIGHTLY POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS A STATE WIDE FORM. SO THEY REQUESTED A STANDARD FOR THE WHOLE STATE- PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION OF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I CAN FURTHER CLARIFY- APPRECIATE THE ANSWER IT'S GREAT THAT IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED- I WOULD. PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON. JUST BECAUSE IT'S STATE DOLLARS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE- A STATEWIDE INDEX YOU KNOW- LET'S SEE WHAT INDEX VERSUS ONE THAT'S THAT'S TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IT JUST MEANS- COUNTY BY COUNTY IT IS THE STATE IS SO DIVERSE I THINK IN A PERFECT WORLD. WE WOULD HAVE IN AND ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES- YOU KNOW SORT OF EVEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE BUT- IT IS WELL KNOWN THE COST OF LIVING IN CERTAIN PLACES- SILICON VALLEY A LOT OF. A LOT OF COASTAL CITIES- I THINK CERTAIN PARTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ARE ARE OFF THE MAP COMPARED TO- ARE OFF THE CHARTS COMPARED TO SOMEPLACE LIKE- YOU KNOW CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTY OR EVEN A CAT COUNTY AND IN IN THE NORTHEAST FOR EXAMPLE SO IT JUST IT JUST. I JUST WORRY THAT FOLKS THEY WERE TRYING TO SERVE GET SORT OF CAUGHT- YOU KNOW IN BETWEEN- IT AND IT IT ADDED THEY JUST PUSH BACK IS IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM THAT HARD TO JUST APPLY. YOU KNOW THE TYPICAL INDEXES THAT ARE OUT THERE TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT. MAYBEMISLI IF YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED. IT'S CERTAINLY WE CAN WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH STAFF- OF THE COMMITTEE UT ALSO PERSONAL STAFF- IF YOU ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED ON THIS ISSUE AND SEE WHAT INFORMATION. WE CAN HELP- PROVIDE OR IF THEY'RE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE AND BE HAPPY TO HELP OUT WITH THAT. OKAY WILL BE FOLLOW UP THEN WITH CENTER CORTESE. THANK YOU. CENTER NEWMAN NOW YES RIGHT I'VE GOT A I GUESS A MORE GENERALIZED. QUESTION OBSERVATION SO. ONE OF THE STATURE IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS FOR THE EARLIER ITEM NOTES THAT- 60% OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO HARASSMENT FROM CREDITORS AND 50% OFF ON HARM. THE AS OF THE RESULT OF SCAMS IN WHICH IS I MEAN WE THINK ABOUT HEALTH WHICH OF THOSE HUGE NUMBERS. AND SO THERE'S A THERE'S A BROADER CHALLENGE MADE YOU KNOW SO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE YOURS CAN ONLY HELP THOSE WHO COME TO YOU. HOW DO WE DO A BETTER JOB. MAKING THIS BIG CONSUMERS LOW INCOME CONSUMERS RECEIVE AWARE OF THESE RESOURCES. AND YOU KNOW TO CENTER CRETACEOUS POINT ARE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND FACING DEBT IS JUST BEING OVERWHELMED BY DEBT AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY A LOT OF THESE GO DEFAULT JUDGMENTS IS PEOPLE JUST. ARE SIMPLY OVERWHELMED BY LIFE BY DAD- AND THAT'S WHY FOR INSTANCE. NOTICES FROM THE IRS DON'T GET OPEN. AND I'M COMPLETELY SYMPATHETIC TO THAT SO THERE'S THIS BROADER QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IS TO TAKE WHAT WE NEED REVISED TO EDUCATE CALIFORNIANS AS. TO KNOW THEIR RIGHTS WITH THESE RESOURCES. I WOULD ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE MIGHT PROVIDE TODAY BY WAY OF. YOU KNOW THROUGH INCREASING THE THRESHOLD HAS HAD LEFT HERE FROM OKAY AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS MR MERMAN YEAH ANY THOUGHTS. YES SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT- WHAT YOU SAY- TRACKS THE EXPERIENCES OF CLICKS MEMBERS. MEET MS COPELAND- MAY ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY I THINK ABOUT STATEWIDE EFFORTS AT EDUCATION- THERE ARE OTHER BILLS POLICY BILLS THAT ARE THAT ARE PENDING THIS YEAR THAT SEEK TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THE FRAUD- AND SENT TO PREVENT- SOME O THE FRAUD THAT THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED BEFORE I'VE I'VE I WILL I'LL REPRESENT THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO- TO- MAYBE OPENING A CONVERSATION YOUR OFFICE ABOUT THIS. WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE SHOULD DO THESE THINGS. BUT INFORMING CALIFORNIANS YOU KNOW AS TO THEIR RIGHTS AND RESOURCES THIS IS A BIG DEAL- THE PANDEMIC MADE IT VERY CLEAR THE MOVIE FOR WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THAT THANK THANK YOU. WELL I KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS A BILL THAT'S- MOVING UP TO HAVE RENT DEBT. COLLECTED OR TREATED AS CONSUMER DEBTS IT HAS ALL OF THE PROTECTIONS AGAINST HARASSMENT JUST ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED. SO ALL HAVE THAT SENATOR PASS IT ON TO YOU I'D LIKE TO TALK TO THAT CENTER SO. AT THANK YOU MANAGER. OKAY OF MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANY FINAL WORDS MR MERMAN OR MISS. A NIGHT LAKE. IF I MAY RESPOND TO SENATOR CORTEZ HE'S CONTENT I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT HAVING A STATE WIDE RECOUNTING WHY. INDEX HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE MORE POPULATED COUNTIES TO ACCOUNT FOR MORE REVENUE FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND FOR THE COURTS. AND THEY HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF POVERTY THEY HAVE HIGHER POPULATIONS MORE PEOPLE WILL SEEK THE COURTS AND HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT IN THOSE COUNTIES. SO WE NEED TO REFLECT THE INCOME SKINNER THAT REFLECTS THE INCOME OF CALIFORNIA THE HIGH COST OF LIVING. WE DO HAVE PROPOSALS UNDER THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT USING THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME AS A STANDARD IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES AND THE COST OF LIVING HERE WHICH IS WHY I RESPECTFULLY. REQUESTING THE ENHANCEMENT BACK LEVEL BECAUSE THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR. THE HIGH COST OF LIVING AND GET MORE OF THE POPULATION THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ACCESS THE COURTS. SO I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES YOUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU TO THE TO THE CHAIR OF IN A MISS. IN A MORE HAPPY TO YOU KNOW. TALK SOME MORE- OFFICE TO OFFICE ON THIS BUT- YOU KNOW YOU. ALL HAVE BEEN USING A LOT OF EXAMPLES IN MY COUNTY IT'S MY RECOLLECTION AND I COULD BE OFF A LITTLE BIT BUT I'VE- ACTUALLY HAD EMPLOYEES IN THIS CATEGORY UNFORTUNATELY EVEN. EVEN AT COUNTY A PAYROLL LEVELS- THAT- A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO. IN OUR COUNTY WOULD BE CONSIDERED UNDER THE FEDERALLY JUST POVERTY LEVEL- IN THE MID SIXTY THOUSAND RANGE REMEMBER THE NUMBER SIXTY THREE OR SIXTY SEVEN. SO WHAT I'M GETTING AT HERE IS THAT TAT PERSON IS OF FALLS INTO- THE COURT FEE WAIVERS. FRAMEWORK WELL WHY WOULDN'T SHE QUALIFY IN MY COUNTY FOR THE FEE WAIVER IF THAT'S THE WAY THIS WORKS IN IN MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS. THAT'S IN IN I'M NOT. AT I GET IT THAT IN YOU KNOW FOR FIVE COUNTIES OVER OR YOU'VE DONE THE SAN BENITO OR SOMEWHERE ELSE MAYBE IT'S FIFTY FIVE. FOR THE SAME PERSON. BUT YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.THE SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO IN MY COUNTY DOESN'T GET LEFT OUT OF WHAT. THE SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO IN SAN BENITO COUNTY WHICH WOULD GET JUST BECAUSE WE'VE GOT. YOU KNOW SORT OF THIS- SPACES- YOU KNOW THIS PLAN LINE- THIS FLAT LINE INDEXING THE UP AND THE STATE- S. WHERE THAT POVERTY LEVEL NUMBER IS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I'M CLARIFY MY CONCERN AT ALL- BUT AGAIN IF I AM. OUT SIDE THE CHALK LINES YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BELIEVER WE HAVE A LONG COMMITTEE MEETING TODAY AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO DISCUSS IT FURTHER. OFFLINE OKAY WILL ENCOURAGE OUR OWN. THE CENTERS AND- MISLI TO FOLLOW UP WITH- CENTER CORTESE. OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY AND- FOR YOUR INSIGHT. WE WANT TO ISSUE THREE WHICH IS COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATES. START WITH THE L. A. O. MISLI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- COMMITTEE STAFF HAS ALSO ASKED US TO INTRODUCED THIS ITEM AND SO THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE CASA ASSOCIATION TO EXPAND TO SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE STATE. CASA PROGRAMS ARE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE TRAINED VOLUNTEERS APPOINTED BY A JUVENILE COURT JUDGE TO ESTABLISH AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT AND ADVOCATE FOR THEM SUCH AS ACCOMPANYING THEM TO COURT HEARINGS- X. CENTER AT. THE STATE- CURRENTLY PROVIDES ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE SEVEN MILLION AND I'M GOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THE COSTA PROGRAM IT WAS LAST INCREASED TO THIS AMOUNT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. STATE FUNDING USED TO SUPPORT. CASA COSTS SUCH AS THE SUPERVISORS THAT THAT- MONITOR THE VOLUNTEERS AS WELL AS RECRUITING AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE STATE PROVIDED FUNDING REPRESENTS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN ON FOSTER FUNDING- AND THE STATE MONEY IS USED TO DRAW DOWN MONEY FROM VARIOUS OTHER SOURCES SUCH AS CORPORATE AND INDIVIDUAL DONORS X. SENTARA. THANK YOUNG. GREAT THANK YOU MISLI OUT WE MOVE ON TO SHARON LAWRENCE FROM CALIFORNIA CASA MISS LAWRENCE. WARNING CHAIR DURAZO AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SHARON LAWRENCE AND I AM HONORED TO BE THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE ASSOCIATION. THE TRUEST WORDS I'VE EVER HEARD A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH SAY QUOTE IT SHOULDN'T HURT TO BE A KID I WONDER HOW DIFFERENT MY LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAVE THERE BEEN SOMEONE IN MY CHILDHOOD WHO IS ABLE TO REALLY HEAR ME BE WITH ME PROTECT ME. END QUOTE IN TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA HAD A DUBIOUS DISTINCTION WE LED THE NATION WITH THE MOST YOUTH AND CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND PLACED INTO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THESE WARDS OF THE STATE OUR CHILDREN ARE LITTLE BOYS AND LITTLE GIRLS TEENAGERS AND YOU WHO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. BUT THEY'VE BEEN PLACED INTO A COMPLEX COURT AND CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WHERE THEIR INDIVIDUAL VOICES MAY NOT BE HEARD. LAST YEAR TEN THOUSAND COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATES OR CASAS HOPE THAT THIRTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA CHILDREN. AFTER BEING RECRUITED AND TRAINED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF AND R. FORTY FOUR LOCAL PROGRAMS CLASSES ARE ASSIGNED TO FOSTER CHILDREN WORKING ONE ON ONE THEY GET TO KNOW THE CHILD LEARN ABOUT THEIR DREAMS GET ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS. WE VIEW OFFICIAL RECORDS INTERVIEW THE CHILD SOCIAL WORKERS ATTORNEYS DOCTORS AND TEACHERS. ULTIMATELY THE CLASSES PROVIDE INPUT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO DEPENDENCY COURT JUDGES ABOUT THE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST. BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY ACOSTA IS BY THE SIDE OF A CHILD DURING A PRETTY AWFUL TIME IN THEIR LIFE PROVIDING HOPE. IN CALIFORNIA WE SERVE FAR TOO FEW OF THESE CHILDREN ONLY 16% OF THE CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM HAVE ACOSTA. AT A COST OF FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS MOST OF WHICH COMES FROM PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY. WHICH IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO INVEST IN OUR NETWORK OF LOCAL CASA PROGRAMS ALL OVER THE STATE SO WE CAN BUILD CAPACITY AND SERVE MORE CHILDREN. OUR VISION IS THAT WE WANT TO SERVE 60% OF THE CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM BUT TO DO THAT WE NEED SPECIFICALLY STATE FUNDING OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TO BE EXPENDED OVER THREE YEARS TO PROVIDE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND CAPACITY NEEDED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN SERVED BY CLASSES. THE MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS WOULD GO TO THE LOCAL CASA PROGRAMS IN FIFTY ONE COUNTIES WHERE 99% OF THE FOSTER CHILDREN RESIDE. SIXTY MILLION FOUR COULD PASS SEE THE BUILDING IN INCREASING STAFF. AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATEWIDE SERVICES SUCH AS RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGNS CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND SYSTEM EFFICIENCIES. THIS INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE COSTA NETWORK WILL JUMPSTART OUR VISION AND PROVIDE LIFE ALTERING ASSISTANCE TO MORE ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN. IT SHOULDN'T HURT TO BE A KID THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS LAWRENCE OF I HAVE A UGH A QUESTION FOR YOU COULD YOU UP. TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU RECRUIT- THE ADVOCATES AND WHAT KIND OF TRAINING YOU DO AND- SO WE CAN HAVE AN IDEA FROM. WHO THEY ARE. WHAT SO COST IS A RECRUITED A NUMBER OF WAYS BY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS GENERALLY THERE ARE PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND THERE ARE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS AT CROSSES pEVENTS WHERE WE CAN RECRUIT MORE CLASSES THAT WILL DO WE AND QUAN A SKYPE MEETING SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. ACOSTA PROGRAMS ALSO RECRUIT FROM LOCAL CHURCHES- WHEN STORIES IN NEWSPAPERS AND CALIFORNIA CUTS THAT DOES LEAD STATEWIDE MARKETING AND PUBLIC TV AND RADIO ADS SO WE DO TRY TO RECRUIT OUR CLASSES FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES THE NUMBER ONE BEST WAY TO BE COULD ACOSTA IS TO HAVE A CASA BRING A FRIEND OR COLLEAGUE INTO THE PROGRAM. I COST OUR VOLUNTEERS TO THEIR PEOPE MEN AND WOMEN FROM MY COMMUNITY THEY MUST BE OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE AND THEN MUST UNDERGO THIRTY FIVE HOURS OF TRAINING AS A VOLUNTEER. AT THE TOP IS INCLUDES SUCH THINGS AS THE LAWS- INVOLVING A CHILD WELFARE AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF SOCIAL WORKERS I DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION- HOW TO WORK WITH FAMILIES- BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS AND- WHAT SERVICES ARE OUT THERE FOR FOSTER YOUTH INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL. IN ADDITION TO THE THIRTY FIVE HOURS OF INITIAL TRAINING AND THE TOPICS ARE MANDATED. BY THE STATE WILL SUPPORT FOR OUR SAYS THEY MUST ALSO TAKE TWELVE HOURS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION A YEAR TO KEEP UP TO DATE ON ALL SORTS. OF NEW PRACTICES AND POLICIES. WELL GOOD CONGRADULATIONS ON ALL OF THAT AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAUSE- THAT- THAT KIND OF COMMITMENT- IT'S PRETTY AMAZING AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATED CENTER NEWMAN YOUNG- I'M A PROUD FORMER CONCERT SO IT'S MISS LAWRENCE NICE TO SEE- MOST OF THE PROUD AUTHOR OF THE RESOLUTION THIS MONTH TO MAKE MAY- COSTS A MONTH THAT CALIFORNIA- AND I TELL YOU HOW I WAS RECRUITED BY MY WIFE SHE DRAGGED ME TO INFORMATION HERE. AND YOU KNOW DID WE ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THE NEED- YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SAY NOBODY BUT YOU KNOW IT IS THERE IS THAT CHALLENGE AS WITH ANYTHING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW TO CONVEY- THE NEIGHBOR ALSO FIND THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND I THINK THERE WAS A THERE WAS EXAMPLE DID SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH ONE OF THE SMART THINGS OF THE COSTA DONE OUR AREA WAS THEY WERE RUNNING OF VIDEO FOR PROSPECTIVE JURORS- IN IN YOU KNOW SHE SAID ABOUT RICHARD WILL- AND AS THEY WERE ABOUT THE FORCED TO DISCONTINUE IT BECAUSE IT WAS BE WITH. IT WOULD LOSE THE JURY POOL SHOW THAT THERE'S A BIG CHALLENGE IN FINDING THE RIGHT KINDS OF FOLKS TO SERVICE CROSSES- I FOR MY PART I AM BETTER AND I THINK SMARTER FOR BEING ACOSTA DID THERE'S A SLICE OF LIFE IN ANY ANY PLACE RESPECT TO ORANGE COUNTY IF YOU SEE IF YOU HAVE SPENT A DAY IN JVENILE COURT- ALONGSIDE A KID WHOSE USER. TRYING TO NAVIGATE THAT SYSTEM WITH WITHOUT MUCH BY WAY RESOURCES YEAH IT IS WRENCHING- AND YOU KNOW THE AND SO YOU KNOW WHO DOES SPEAK FOR THE CHILD SO WE NEED MORE CLASSES I'D I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT THIS IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN- I AM CONCERNED HOWEVER ABOUT YOU KNOW THE BROADER CHALLENGES OF MARKETING RIGHT EIGHT HOW DO WE REACH A PERSPECTIVE KOSS'S- ADVOCATES. YOU KNOW GLAD TO RESOURCE ANYWAY THAT I CAN'T. BUT THIS IS NOT. IN WHEN YOU LOOK AT SORT OF A LARGE SURPLUS. I THINK YOU MAKE ALL THAT THE BRIDGE. ON THE- WOULD BE. HUGE MORE IN. TO MISSILE POINT THE- IS WHAT IS- AND KIDS ARE FULLY DESERVE. OF ITS SUPPORT AS THEY POSSIBLY HAVE. AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY TO ADULTHOOD BUT SERVED YOU KNOW THANK YOU THE TESTIMONY TO BE GLAD TO HELP IN ANYWAY THAT I CAN. THANK YOU SAID. THE NEWMAN FOR SPONSORING AT CONCEPT RISHI ASIAN WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT INFIELD OKAY OF. WE THINK IT TO SENATOR NEWMAN'S- ISSUE THAT HE HAS RAISED ABOUT THE RECRUITMENT- YOU MENTIONED THE VARIOUS WAYS- IS THERE A- SHORTAGE OF COSTS OF. POTENTIAL CAUSES OF HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT IF THERE IS AND IF WITH THIS- INCREASE- YOU'RE EXPECTING- OF COURSE SEVERAL THOUSAND MORE OF VOLUNTEERS A MORE ADVOCATES HOW WOULD YOU FEEL THAT NEED AS FAR AS RECRUITMENT. RECRUITMENT IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR US BECAUE NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE PROGRAM AT ONCE PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT IT THEY GET VERY EXCITED BUT ONE OF THE BARRIERS THAT WE HAVE IS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH CHILDREN IN A CONFIDENTIAL CLOSED COURT SYSTEM SO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY SHOW THE CHILDREN OR TELL THOSE STORIES WHEN USING THEIR TRUE NAMES. SO IT'S A SYSTEM THAT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT- RECENTLY WE DID A PSA PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT WITH A FORMER SURGEON GENERAL DR NADINE BURKE HARRIS I AND WE I PLAYED THAT ALL OVER CALIFORNIAN IT REALLY DID BRING IN VOLUNTEERS SO OUR STRATEGY REALLY IS TO. INCREASE THE VISIBILITY OF THE LOCAL CASA PROGRAMS DO STATEWIDE MARKETING BOTH IN PRINT RADIO AND TV SO THAT WE CAN REALLY RAISE OUR VISIBILITY AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT IN SAN DIEGO AT SAN DIEGO'S PROGRAM IS NOW SERVING THE MAJORITY THEIR CHILDREN. BUT IT JUST TAKES HARD WORK AND IT DOES TAKE AN INVESTMENT IN MARKETING WHICH IS WHERE THE STATE WOULD PUT- MANY MORE DOLLARS WE'VE NEVER HAD THE RESOURCES TO DO A STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN OF THE NATURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND YES AND IT SENATOR RAND THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF PROCESS. ON BECAUSE DON'T I THINK THE PUBLIC DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP FAMILIES AND SO IT WOULD BE A HUGE MEDIA BLITZ OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS I WITH A TARGETED STRATEGY BE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HELPING MORE CHILDREN AND WE THINK WE CAN DO IT WITH THE RIGHT INVESTMENT. RIGHT OKAY IF NO OTHER CAR THANK YOU MISS LAWRENCE APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND- A BIG APPRECIATION TO THE PROCESS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY BUT WE MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE FOR. A RELINQUISHMENT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND WE WILL HAVE ON THE L. A. OLE MISS LEE MAKE A PRESENTATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR- SISENSE I JUST ASK THAT WE INTRODUCED THIS PROPOSAL BUT ALSO- KIND OF PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN YOUR AGENDA RELATED TO ANALYSIS THAT WE DID AS PART. OF OUR WORK ANALYZING THE GOVERNOR'S PUBLIC SAFETY PACKAGE- IF YOU RECALL THERE WAS A PROPOSAL AND THAT WAS PART OF THAT BARGAIN BUY BACK PROGRAM SO THE SENATE IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL RELATED TO FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT- WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR WORK WE PRESENTED- INFORMATION RELATED TO- A FIRE ARM. KIND OF DATA. AND SO THAT IS SOME OF THAT INFORMATION IS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA AND SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT INDICATED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A GROWTH. IN HOMICIDE FIREARM DEATHS AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF HOMICIDES AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS AND ROBBERIES THAT HAVE INVOLVED FIREARMS. ADDITIONALLY AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR THERE WERE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ON THE STATE'S ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONS LAST. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY BECOME PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION THAT THEY HAD PURCHASED LEGALLY BEFORE. BECAUSE THEY WERE CONVICTED OF FELONIES AND SOME MISDEMEANOR. FOUND BY A COURT TO BE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS DUE TO MENTAL ILLNESS OR HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THEM. AS PART OF OUR ANALYSIS WE DID HIGHLIGHT TWO OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IF THE LEGISLATURE WAS INTERESTED IN- KIND OF TARGETING FIREARM RELATED I'M PUBLIC SAFETY CALLS AND BOTH OF THOSE ARE REFLECTED IN YOUR AGENDA. AND SO ONE- WAS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DOJ'S GUN VIOLENCE REDUCTION PROGRAM FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO FURTHER REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONS ON THE STATE LAST. AND ALSO TO- EXPAND TO POTENTIALLY EXPAND THE LANGUAGE THAT OTHER ONE FORSMAN AGENCIES BEYOND TO THE SHERIFF'S WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE GRANTS. THE OTHER OPTION THAT WE PROVIDED WAS RELATED TO REMOVING FIREARMS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY BECOME PROHIBITED AND THIS IS SORT OF IN LINE WITH WHAT THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING AS PART OF THIS- ISSUE. THIS IS A QUICKLY BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN INDIVIDUALS ARE SUPPOSED TO RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS AT THE TIME OF THEIR CONVICTION FOR A FELONY OR CERTAIN MISDEMEANORS. AND SO WE OPTION THAT WE PROVIDED WAS THAT PROVIDING FUNDING TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO INSURE THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND THEY WERE BEING SURRENDERED COULD BE EFFECTIVE- AT LIMITING THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU MISLI ARE WILL MOVE ON NOW TO HEAR FROM JULIA WEBER FROM THE GIFFORDS LAW CENTER. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS JULIA WEBER I SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTOR AT DIFFERENCE LAWCENTER AND- TEACH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAW IT GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. I'M APPEARING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF GIFFORDS. AND I'VE WORKED IN OF FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS INCLUDING A SEVENTEEN YEARS ITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON VIOLENCE PREVENTION ISSUES. I'VE ALSO COLLABORATED WITH HOST ON TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ON FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT. AND BECAUSE OF THIS I KNOW HOW CRITICAL IT IS THAT WE FUNDED PROGRAMS TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROHIBITED. FROM HAVING FIREARMS ARE ACTUALLY SEPARATED FROM THOSE FIREARMS AS CLOSE TO THE TIME OF PROHIBITION IS POSSIBLE. THERE ARE SO MANY TRAGEDIES ON MY MIND TODAY. ADULTS CHILDREN POLICE OFFICERS COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN SHATTERED BY GUN VIOLENCE. AND SPECIFICALLY BY THOSE WHO REMAIN IN POSSESSION OF FIREARMS. DESPITE BEING PROHIBITED. LAST YEAR ROBERT LEWIS AT CALMATTERS REVEALED THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM WHEN HE COVERED THE STORY OF KELLY GRAY A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD MOTHER OF THREE WHO SOUGHT PROTECTION FROM HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND. BY REQUESTING A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM IN TWENTY TWENTY IN MADERA. HE TOLD HER A RESTRAINING ORDER WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A PIECE OF PAPER AND WOULDN'T KEEP HIM AWAY. KELLY HAD THE COURAGE TO CHECK THE BOX ON THE PETITION FORM FOR HER CIVIL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. INDICATING THAT YES SHE BELIEVES THE PERSON TO BE RESTRAINED. OWNS OR POSSESSES GUNS FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE PRESENCE OF A FIREARM IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE MAKES IT FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAT A VICTIM WILL BE KILLED. SHE ALSO INCLUDED MORE THAN A DOZEN PAGES DESCRIBING HORRIFIC ABUSE AND THROUGH IT ALL WITH MENTION OF A GUN IN HIS POCKET WHEN HE YELLED AT HER OUTSIDE THEIR SON'S SCHOOL. AND WHEN HE THREATENED TO TAKE HER INTO THE ORCHARDS AND KILL HER. AT THE HEARING THE JUDGE WHO HAD SAID ON THE RECORD THAT HE HAD REVIEWED THE FILING ASK ONLY ONE QUESTION ABOUT GUNS THAT YOU HAVE ANY GUNS OR FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION YOU THINK YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE. NO HER HUSBAND REPLIED. THE DELAYS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INVESTIGATION AND AN EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER THAT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY GUN RELINQUISHMENT TO OR SEIZURE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT SUGGESTS THERE WERE MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERVENE. BUT LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER THE HEARING SALLY'S HUSBAND SHOT AND KILLED HER IN FRONT OF THEIR THREE CHILDREN AGES SIX FOUR AND ONE. WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER. IN CRIMINAL CASES THERE IS A GOVERNMENT FUNDED ATTORNEYS ON BOTH SIDES M. PROBATION MAY BE INVOLVED TO HELP ENSURE FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT HAPPENS BUT FAMILY COURTS DON'T HAVE THE STATE FUNDED RESOURCES SO JUDGES COURT STAFF AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE CRITICAL ESPECIALLY IN. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS OR DVR ROSE. GIFFORD SPONSORED SB THREE TWENTY LAST YEAR TO CLEARLY SET OUT WHAT EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITIES ARE IN THESE CASES. NOW COURTS MUST PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW RESTRAINED PARTIES CAN COMPLY. LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST REMOVE FIREARMS IN PLAIN SIGHT OR FOUND THROUGH A CONSENSUAL SEARCH OR THE PARTY HAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO RELINQUISH IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO PROVIDE PROOF TO THE COURT. THE OF COMPLIANCE ISN'T PROVIDED IN THE CIVIL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. THE COURT MUST NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT IMMEDIATELY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST TAKE ALL ACTIONS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE PARTY'S FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION. THE COURT MUST REVIEW THE FILE AND REPORT VIOLATIONS TO THE PROSECUTING AGENCY WITHIN TWO DAYS. FAMILY COURTS CONCERT REVIEW HEARINGS AS WELL AND SOME ARE BUT WE AREN'T SEEING ENOUGH EXAMPLES OF THESE PRACTICES BEING IMPLEMENTED THERE IS NO CONSISTENT PROCESS IN OUR COUNTIES FOR COLLECTING WEAPONS FROM PEOPLE WITH COURT ORDERED FIREARM PROHIBITIONS ON RELATED TO A CRIMINAL CONVICTION. SUCH AS D. V. ALL THOSE IN KING COUNTY SEATTLE WASHINGTON THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS A NORMAL SLEEP FROM OF FIREARMS COURT COORDINATOR. WHOSE ROLE IS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION TO THE JUDGES AND CIVIL PROCEEDINGS. AND COORDINATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE SWIFT FOLLOW UP ON NON COMPLIANCE WE KNOW WHAT WORKS WHEN JURISDICTIONS DEDICATED PERSONNEL TO ENFORCING PROHIBITIONS AND WHEN COURTS FOLLOW PROTOCOLS TO IMPLEMENT ORDERS GUNS ARE TAKEN OFF THE STREETS. YES THERE IS A LOT OF DETAIL NUANCE AND COMPLEXITY HERE WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO THIS. LAWS REQUIRING VIOLENT PARTNERS TO RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS ARE LINKED TO A 16% REDUCTION IN GUN HOMICIDES. THAT TANGIBLE BENEFIT IS ONLY AVAILABLE IF WE FIND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE POLICIES WE NEED DEDICATED LOCAL PERSONNEL TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS ENSURE VICTIMS WHO OFTEN HAVE VERY GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESTRAINT PARTIES ACCESS TO FIREARMS. ARE ACTUALLY HURT. NO MATTER HOW SOMEONE BECOMES PROHIBITED WE NEED TO ACT QUICKLY WHEN WE IGNORE FIREARM PROHIBITIONS WE UNDERMINE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE ENTIRE ORDER. WASTING PRECIOUS RESOURCES AND PUTTING PARTNER PARTIES ARE AT RISK WE SEND THE MESSAGE THAT LIES ASSEMBLY PROTECTED BY THOSE ORDERS DON'T MATTER. AND THAT WERE WILLING TO RISK THE LIVES OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO MAY LATER ENCOUNTER THIS ARMED PROHIBITED PERSON. WE UNNECESSARILY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE ARMORY THE PERSON SYSTEM SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM ALLOWED RESTRAIN INDIVIDUALS. TO MAINTAIN THEIR FIREARMS EVEN AFTER THE BREAK PROHIBITS. IN A TO SAVING LIVES AND EFFECTIVELY LIBERTY RESOURCES FUNDING FOR LOCAL FIREARMS RELINQUISHMENT WILL ULTIMATELY INCREASE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM'S ABILITY TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU MISS WEBER ARMS WE HAVE- ALSO STEVE LINDLEY FROM THE ORGANIZATION BRADY. THE MANAGER IN THE MORNING ON THE FIRST MINISTRY LONELY AND I'M A TWENTY SIX YEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE AND WAS THE CHIEF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT JUSTICE YOU'RE FINE SHE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF. AND REPRESENTATION FOR THE BRADY CAMPAIGN FOR GUN VIOLENCE PRETTY IS ONE OF THE AMERICA'S OLDEST DEMONSTRATION AND OUR HISTORY GOES BACK DECADES EACH YEAR MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE MORE THAN FORTY FIVE THOUSAND. CALIFORNIANS ARE PROHIBITED SUCH MORE COMING ON AFTER. PROGRAM WAS THE CENTER ALLEGEDLY. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AS A RESULT OF THE PROLIFERATION OF GUN VIOLENCE ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE NATION. THE POST OF THE PROGRAM'S DISARMED FELONS MENTALLY ILL PERSONS AND OTHER DAYS INDIVIDUALS. AB DATABASE WENT INTO EFFECT IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. CRAWFORD THIS IS BYRON OWNERS ACROSS THE STATE AGAINST CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. IN RESTRAINING ORDERS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE COMFORTED. FROM ISN'T APART SOMETHING WHICH THE LEGAL ACQUISITION. FOR THE REGISTRATION OF THE FARMERS CHOCOLATE. THIS IS A PROACTIVE WAY TO PREVENT CRIME AND REDUCE VIOLENCE INCLUDING INSTANCE INSTANCE OF RESERVOIRS. THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S A PERSON ONLY STATE OF THE NATION TO ESTABLISH AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM. THE CHICKEN FARMERS WHO MIGHT FALL INTO A PROHIBITED STATUS. THE COMPANY'S APPS MISSION OF REMOVING FIREARMS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY POSE A THREAT TO THEMSELVES. OR SHORT COMMUNITIES YOU'RE TRAIN COMES OFF AS A SIDE DISH UP ON. OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS RECREATION IS IMPORTANT PROGRAM. TO REMOVE FIREARMS PROHIBITED INDIVIDUALS LISTED IN THE APP SYSTEM. UNTIL TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE APP'S DATABASE WAS INSTITUTIONALLY BASED ON HANDGUN TRANSSEXUAL DESPITE THE FACT THAT APPROXIMATELY. HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA FARMS. INVOLVED LONG. THANK YOU TO REVERSE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW MANDATED CORPORATE JUSTICE. COLLECTOR CAME FARM TRANSACTION INFORMATION FOR ALL TYPES OF FIREARMS INCLUDING AUGUST. THIS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED NUMBER OF SERVERS ALL OF THE AFTER EFFECTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ALONE I 16% OR SO GOOD FOR GAME PERHAPS. IN THE PRIOR YEAR. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SENATE BILL ONE FORTY FIVE PASSED THE SENATE. OVERWHELMINGLY CHOOSING. APPROXIMATED TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS THE FORMER JUST YOU REDUCE. OPINION APPLICATIONS. THIS IS SENATE BILL ONE FORTY. THE DEPARTMENT DRESSES AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IS IN APPS AS FOR HIM TO RECOVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FILES. ALL OF THESE EFFORTS ARE ROADWORTHY DO NOT SOLVE OUR PROBLEM GOVERNMENTS HOWEVER WITH THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM NOW FIFTY YEARS AFTER FOR SPRINT WE HAVE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE ARRESTED AGENTS AND RECOVERING FARMS. SUBJECT MAYBE SEPARATE MORE COST EFFECTIVE FROM COVER FIREARMS. FOR PROHIBIT BURSTS. IN TWO THOUSAND- SIXTY THREE REQUIRED THAT YEAH. PROBATE OFFICER. ON START INTERDICTING FIRES PROHIBITIONS AT THE TIME OF SHE HOWEVER THIS MAN. TO OUR COUNTY FRANCISCO- WHEN YOU LOOK AT A FULLY FUNDED PROGRAM YOU HAVE SUCCESS. WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO ASSIST THE COURTS INFORMATION APPORTION FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION RELINQUISHMENT AT THE TIME. OF THE RESTRAINING ORDER OR SENTENCE. YES THIS TAKES EFFORT COMMITMENT AND FUNDING OKAY WE REALLY AFFORD. NOT TO TAKE HIS ACTIONS. WE WERE FROM A INTEREST OF CAMANCHE BEFORE. TWENTY FIVE COST OF VIOLENCE THE CITY OF CA. ESTIMATED EACH FOR IN HOMICIDE TAXPAYERS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. THERE'S A STRIP CLUB REFORM FURTHER AS THE THAT NOT. INJURIES COST TAXPAYERS A PROCESS NINE I NINE HUNDRED IS THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS AND A TEN YEAR PERIOD BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE WERE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND FARMERS HOMICIDES IN CALIFORNIA. USUALLY REPORTED COST REQUIREMENT WAITED HOMOSEXUALS THEIR STOCK AND IS FINALLY HOME SAYS COST CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. SEVENTY SIX BILLION. OR POINT SIX BILLION PER YEAR. CALIFORNIA HAS MASON INVESTMENTS IN LIKE PERFORMS UNIQUE THINGS EFFORTS TO REDUCE INVITED COMMUNITIES ROBERT STATE CALIFORNIA'S GHG EMISSIONS REDUCE FARM WHERE VIOLENCE AND REMOVE FIREARMS FROM PERSONSREMOVE THEMAS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND DOING THAT IN THE COURTS AND PROBATION. IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN USE OUR PARTY THANK YOU FOR THE CONSIDERATION. TO DOUBLE THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER LINDLEY I HAVE A FOR ME- WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT WE- AS A STATE HAVE. WHY HAVEN'T WE DONE THIS. WHEREVER WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU SEE FROM OUR STATE MOVING FORWARD. BUT I THINK ONE OF THE COMPLEXITY THEORY IS- IS A LACK OF RECOGNITION OF HOUSE SIGNIFICANT THE CIVIL COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE IN THIS AREA. THAT IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE WE TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS 97% OF THOSE G. V. R. ROSE HAVE BEEN. OPPOSITION FOR BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY ARE OFTEN GIARDIA THE TIME REPRESENTED BY CITY ATTORNEYS. SO THEY'RE IN A CIVIL COURT AND THEY'RE PURSUING. A CIVIL RESTRAINING ORDER BUT REALLY THE STATE IS ACTING IN THE MAJORITY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS WERE LOOKING AT THE VAST MAJORITY SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. NO ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE PARTY TO BE RESTRAINED. ARE THERE'S JUST THE JUDGE. MET HOPEFULLY A BAILIFF. TOO OFTEN NOT EVEN A COURT REPORTER SO NO PROBATION AND NO LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT I AND THAT MEANS THAT A LOT FALLS ON THE JUDGE. AND SORT OF YOU KNOW CROSSING YOUR FINGERS AND HOPING PEOPLE COMPLY- UNLESS WE FIND SOMETHING LIKE A FIREARMS. RELINQUISHMENT COORDINATOR AND LAST WEEK PASSED POLICIES THAT REQUIRE THAT THE COURT ACTS SO THERE'S BEEN I'D SAY SOME REAL THE COLLECT OF THE FIREARM PROHIBITIONS IN THE CIVIL CONTEXT AND THAT'S WHERE THE MAJORITY IF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GOES TO COURT IT MORE OFTEN IT'S GOING TO BE IN FAMILY CIVIL COURT THAN CRIMINAL COURT. SO WE HAVE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION I THINK THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS- AND JUST DO A BETTER JOB COORDINATING SO THAT NO MATTER WHAT DOOR YOU WALK THROUGH IN TERMS OF HOW YOU GET PROHIBITED WE CONSISTENTLY INSURER FIREARMS ARE RELINQUISHED RECEIVES. THANK YOU. MOST CENTER SENATOR NEWMAN- THANK YOU MEASURE SHOW- FOR MUSLIM THE IDEA OF YOU KNOW THAT THE ANECDOTE YOU YOU TOLD ABOUT THE INCIDENT IN MADERA JIM IS TRULY TERRIFYING I GUESS FOR YOU OR MR I'M SORRY MISS WEBER- MISTER LINDLEY THE DO WE HAVE DATA I MEAN IT SEEMS IT SEEMS FAIRLY OBVIOUS RIGHT IN THE PROBLEM YOU DESCRIBE IS REAL- BUT YOU KNOW THE- THE APS SYSTEM REALLY SUFFERS FROM YOU. WE CONTRACT REGISTERED WEAPONS BUT NOT UNREGISTERED WEAPONS SEEMS TO BE PRETTY LIKELY THE KINDS PEOPLE GET INTO YOU KNOW THE DOMESTIC DISPUTES RETARDER PRETTY LIKE THAT OF UNREGISTERED WEAPONS- WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT WHAT DO WE HAVE DATA ON YOU KNOW THOSE. YOU KNOW THE FREQUENCY IN WHICH- SOMEBODY WHO IS THE TARGET RESTRAINING ORDER ACTUALLY DOES HAVE UNREGISTERED WEAPONS AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY PROBLEMS IN RELINQUISHMENT OF THROUGH THAT HOST BUT DO YOU KNOW GOING TO A HOME GOING INTO A RESIDENTIAL SOMEWHERE IN AND DOING A SWEEP FOR WEAPONS. TO YOUR ME SO WE ASK THE QUESTIONS TO MR POINT EARLY DO YOU HAVE. WEAPONS SO WITH WHAT WE HAVE BY WAY OF DATA- TO SUPPORT- A SMARTER EVIDENCED BASED APPROACH ON THIS. WELL I THINK I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE COMPLEXITIES HERE IS THAT. WHEN WE ASK THE FOR. THE PROTECTED PARTY OR THE PERSON REQUESTING A RESTRAINING ORDER. WE OFTEN GET A TON OF INFORMATION AND IN FACT I GET CALLS AND EMAILS REGULARLY FROM- THE HANDFUL OF ATTORNEYS WHO ARE REPRESENTING VICTIMS- RECORDING YOU KNOW LOTS OF. EVIDENCE BEING PRESENTED IN THE PETITIONS THAT SPEAK TO. THE PERSON HAVING UNREGISTERED. A POST PICTURES THEMSELVES ON FACEBOOK THEY TELL PEOPLE THEY SOMETIMES EVEN TESTIFY OF A LIST OF CASES WHERE THEY'VE SAID SURE. SHE'S NOT NOW LYING- BUT WE STILL DON'T SEEM ABLE TO REALLY FOCUS ON TAKING THOSE NEXT STEPS AND I'D SAY STEVE- MISTER LINDLEY MAY BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO PROVIDE ANY ACTUAL DATA ON. UNREGISTERED FIREARMS I JUST KNOW THAT WHEN THERE IS MAYBE ONE FIREARM THAT SHOWS UP IN THE- AUTOMATED FIREARMS SYSTEM TOO OFTEN IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER FIREARMS. THAT THE PROTECTED PARTY OF THE PARTY SEEKING PROTECTION. TRIES TO TELL THE COURT ABOUT OR KNOWS ABOUT. THAT WE CAN ONLY GET BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT IF WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH THEM IN ADDITION TO. THE PERSON TO BE RESTRAINED BUT I DON'T KNOW STEVE IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. UNREGISTERED SO EARLY ON ME OUT FROM AROUND THERE IS A RESEARCH DONE BY A DOCTOR YOU SEE DAVIS- WERE RELATED TO COUNTIES AND HOW THEY RECOVERED FIREARMS OF ONE OF THE- WHEN DID PROGRAMS WAS FOUR. ENFORCEMENT TO INTERVIEW TO PROTECT PARTLY ABOUT HOW MANY FIREARMS- THE- OTHER INDIVIDUAL MIGHT HAVE OFTENTIMES THE OTTOMAN A FARM SYSTEM THAT MIGHT HAVE ONE OR TWO WIRELESS THAT SYSTEM. BUT END UP HAVING A HUNTER TWENTY FIREARMS- ACTUALLY- OTHER RESIDENTS- OVER THE TIME OF THE APPS PROGRAM A VAST MAJORITY OF THE FIREARMS ARE RECOVERED- FROM PROHIBIT INDIVIDUALS. ARE NOT LISTED IN THE FARM SYSTEM. THAT THEY I'M NECESSARILY. ON REGISTERED WAR THAT THEY WERE PURCHASED ILLEGALLY IT'S JUST THAT THE SYSTEM DIDN'T TRACK LONGER IN CELLS BEFORE TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND DIDN'T S. ACCURATELY. REFLECT AND TRACK. GOOD CELLS BEFORE NINETEEN SIX SO FARMS ARE TIME HELPING PROTECT. SO THESE DON'T AS WE WOULD LIKE JUST OF THE ONLY DO WHAT THE LAW ALLOWS YOU. WHAT A **** BEFORE COVERED AFTER THIS IS A- OR NOT LET'S IN IN THE ESTATE I HAVEN'T VIRUSES RESTRAINING ORDER IN YOUR BEFORE A JUDGE THE JUDGE JESSICA JERRY ARE YOU UNDER OATH WHEN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT ARE THE- PENALTIES FOR MANAGING A QUESTION. FALSELY YOU ARE UNDER OATH YES YOU'RE UNDER OATH IT'S PENALTY OF PERJURY. OF AND YOU KNOW. IT YOU ARE OFTEN. OF RESTRAINED AS WELL- BECAUSE THERE MAY BE AN EX PARTE ORDER IN PLACE OR AN EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER- MAY HAVE BEEN ISSUED- IN UNDER THE PANDEMIC RULES THOSE WERE EXTENDED- ARE PROHIBITED AT THOSE POINTS AS WELL- AND YET WE HAVE NOT. TO YOUR POINTS THE FOLLOW UP THAT MATTERS NOPE NO PREACHER YANKEE MANAGER AND THE- THE PROPOSAL I'M SORRY DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION COMING. UP JUST IN TERMS OF HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED ARE YOU MENTIONED- PROBATION GOING TO PROBATION OR LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THERE'D BE A BIGGER ROLE WOULD THAT MEAN. THE FOR THE WEDDING WOULD GO TOWARDS MORE. BALONNE FORSMAN PERSONNEL OR MORE PROBATION PERSONNEL FILE A DIFFERENT STANDPOINT WHAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON IS NOT SO MUCH PROBATION- BUT WHAT I MENTIONED IN TERMS OF THE EXAMPLE FROM KING COUNTY SEATTLE WASHINGTON WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH YOU KNOW- THE FACT THE PROBATION PLAYS A ROLE IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER PROP SIXTY THREE WHERE THEY HAVE TO ENSURE FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT HAPPENS AND THEY HAVE TO TELL. LOCAL WE WILL BE A SIMILAR. IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS IN FOR EXAMPLE THESE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER PROCEEDINGS SO SOMETHING LIKE A FIREARMS RELINQUISHMENT COORDINATOR WHOSE JOB IT WOULD BE TO ENSURE THAT PROTOCOLS ARE IN PLACE. THE JUDGES GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED THERE ARE CERTAIN BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE PERFORMED UNDER FAMILY CODE SECTION SIX THREE OH SIX IN FAMILY LAW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROCEEDINGS. THAT WOULD GET THEIR JOBS BETTER INFORMATION THEY COULD BE LOOKING AT CRIMINAL DATABASE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT SOMEONE ISN'T REVIEW NO PROHIBITED IN CRIMINAL. ON PROBATION AND THAT INFORMATION ISN'T GIVEN TO THE FAMILY COURT. WILL BE COORDINATING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO WE REALLY SEE THE NEED TO HAVE DEDICATED PERSON IN EVERY COURT. R. THAT WORKS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBATION AND THE CIVIL COURTS TO ENSURE BETTER COORDINATION SO THAT WOULD BE OUR OUR EMPHASIS OKAY. OKAY SIR COURTESY. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE- FIRST OF ALL. I'M I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE. YOU KNOW MORE ENERGY GOING INTO THE SIDE OF THINGS- IN A I'M NOT ASKING ANYONE TO AGREE WITH YOU BUT I JUST THINK THAT. YOU KNOW SO MUCH HAS BEEN SO MUCH ENERGY AND LEGISLATION AN EFFORT HAS BEEN PUT INTO WHAT I WOULD CALL THE HARDWARE SIDE OF. OF FIRE ARMS CONTROL AND- TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT'S SAFER YOU KNOW GUNS WITH. SMALL CLUBS OR LARGE GROUPS AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WHEN- THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE JUST DOING. AN EXTRAORDINARILY- ANEMIC JOB OF GETTING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME IN THE FIRST PLACE- REGARDLESS OF. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE HARDWARE LOOKS LIKE OR FEELS LIKE- IN IN. IN ALSO I JUST THINK AS A- EDITORIAL STATEMENT YOU KNOW THIS APPROACH RELEASE. STEERS AWAY FROM FOLKS WHO ARE MORE HEALTHY LAW ABIDING FIREARMS OWNERS WHO WHO AREN'T- YOU KNOW IN THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE BEEN DESCRIBING SYSTEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN DESCRIBING ALL ALONG SO. GREAT THE COUPLE JUST A COUPLE. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ONE OF THEM IS I HAD A- THE CONSTITUENT OF A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHO- WAS FIFTY ONE FIFTIES IN A- MENTAL HEALTH. THIS FACILITY IN A MEDICAL FACILITY- WHO THEN HAD THE OJ SHOW UP- AT HIS HOUSE AND- SAY- YOU HAVE A REGISTERED FIREARM WE NEED IT AND IT'S GONNA OUTLINED HERE IN THE PACKET HOW THAT HOW THAT GOES YOU CAN- TRANSMITTERS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE OR OR GIVE IT UP OR THEY CAN STORE FOR USE. AS A RECALL THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WAS VERY COOPERATIVE SO I SHOULDN'T HAVE THE FIREARM- BUT CONTACTED ME WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT. WHY HIS MEDICAL INFORMATION IN THE FACILITY WAS IN WASN'T PROTECTED IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE DOJ FOLKS KNEW HIS MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION- SO ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S CREATING ANY COMPLEXITY AT ALL MAYBE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CHALLENGE AND I KNOW A LOT OF FIFTY ONE FIFTIES HAPPEN. ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE VERSUS THE- OF MEDICAL PROVIDER SIDE OR THE SOCIAL WORKER SIDE BUT- DID IT WELL I NEVER COULD GET A GOOD QUITE A GOOD ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. ON ON THE CONSTITUENTS BEHALF HOWEVER IN THIS IS A SUBWAY. I SPOKE TO THE ACTUAL- THE ACTUAL DOJ OFFICER. WHO HAD SHOWED SHOWED UP AT THE HOUSE- WHO- WHO HAD REQUESTED THE RELINQUISHMENT. IN IN- CONSISTENT TO SOME DEGREE WITH THIS WHOLE PRESENTATION TODAY- HE SAID THE BIGGER QUESTION IS- IT WITH FELONIES WITH WITH WITH. ALL OF THE THINGS W TALKED ABOUT TODAY THAT WOULD. GIVE RISE TO A LEGAL PROHIBITION OF FOR AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL FIREARM ASIDE FOR MENTAL HEALTH. THAT THEY WERE. WERE TO DOJ OFFICERS FOR THE BAY AREA THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE WERE ASSIGNED TO THE RELINQUISHMENT PROGRAM. AND I DON'T REMEMBER I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS COUPLE YEARS AGO THE NUMBER OF CASES HE SAID THAT THEY HAD IN THE DATABASE THAT THEY WERE. CHARGED WITH PURSUING BUT IT WAS- BUT AN EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH NUMBER YOU KNOW FAR BEYOND WHAT EVEN A CHILD WOULD PROBABLY SAY IMMEDIATELY THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO ALL THOSE- SO PART OF MY QUESTION WHICH IS. ANOTHER ONE OF BE REDUNDANT TO WHAT THE CHURCH'S ASKED BUT YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW THESE DOLLARS ARE INVESTED ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SAY THEY COULD SEE. THE OF YOU KNOW THE EMPHASIS ON THE COORDINATOR SPECIALLY ON THE FAMILY LOST SIGHT OF INTERCEPTING NO. I THINK NO. NO THERE SHOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE NO WIGGLE ROOM IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES- YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE TO CONTINUE. HOLDING A FIRM THAT SENT A RESTRAINING ORDER- OR OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF DVD- BUT BEYOND THAT WERE BEING. THEY WERE LOOKING AT TODAY AS PART OF ITS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IN A KISS IN THIS MAYBE THESE QUESTIONS OR OFFER MISS GIVE MISS WILL HAS WEBER SORRY OF THIS WEBER- IS THERE IS PART OF. THE REQUESTED OR WHERE WE WANT TO GO HI I'M TRYING TO BOLSTER UP THE F. T. E. IN THE DOJ IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT ARE JUST GOING OUT DOING THE WORK AGES IT'S IT SEEMS SO CLEAR TO ME THAT. THERE'S YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU TOOK MENTAL HEALTH OUT OF IT TEMPORARILY SUGGESTED APPROVED SAYING THAT THEY HAD SO MANY CASES TO PURSUE THAT YOU KNOW EASILY EXPANDING THE RANKS BY BY FIVE TIMES OR TEN TIMES WOULD WOULD NOT OF BEEN LAVISH RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD ANYONE SPEAK TO THAT. SPECIFIC NEED. WELL SO- I AM CERTAINLY AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME I'M THE LAST PERSON WHO'S GONNA SAY THERE ARE ENOUGH RESOURCES AND CERTAINLY- EXAMPLE. SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY THIS IS A SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT LACK OF RESOURCES IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING- IS THE APPS ENFORCEMENT UNITS- WHAT IT IS THAT THE DOJ LEVEL BUT WHAT I'M MOST. CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THOSE FOLKS END UP WITH A LOT MORE ON THEIR PLATE I WE DON'T ACT. IMMEDIATELY AS CLOSE TO THE TIME OF PROHIBITION AS POSSIBLE WHICH MEANS. UTILIZING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL COURT PERSONNEL RIGHT SO IF WE DO A BETTER JOB WHICH MAKES MORE SENSE IN TERMS OF THE INCREASED RISK AND DANGER THE LONGER WE DELAY- AGAIN KING COUNTY SEATTLE WASHINGTON IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THIS. THAT WAS THE WHOLE FOCUS REDUCING THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN SOMEONE BECOMES PROHIBITED AND WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS IN PLACE TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO RELINQUISH. FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO PROVIDE TO THE COURT AND UNDER SB THREE TWENTY. THE COURT SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT FILE IMMEDIATELY WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME NOTICING SOMEONE HASN'T COMPLIED AND THEN REPORTING THAT TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE LOCAL PROSECUTING AGENCY SO A LOT OF THIS HAS TO HAPPEN LOCALLY. SO WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF IMPROVING THE ACCESS TO RESOURCE FOR FOLKS LOCALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH IN COORDINATION WITH THE WELL TRAINED. YOU KNOW NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE IN APPS THE DOJ AND SUPPORT THESE LOCAL EFFORTS WITH EVEN THE ARMED PROHIBITED PERSONS LEGISLATIVE RECORD. INSISTENTLY SAYS. WHILE THEY'RE ASKING FOR FUNDING. IF ONE DAY THEY CONSISTENTLY SAID THAT REPORT WE HAVE TO MOVE. THE LOCAL LEVEL TWO MORE IMMEDIATELY. ENSURE. RELINQUISHMENT HALF. THE I'M YOU SEE BOTH AND I MEAN THEY'RE BUT THEY'RE BOTH NEEDED- APPS- ARE. IF WILL AND- AND IN THE VOCAL COORDINATION THIS THIS. PRESENTATION TODAY THIS THIS BUDGET REQUEST THOSE IS FOCUSED ON THE LOCAL SIDE IS THAT CORRECT COMMISSION UNDERSTAND IN A MINUTE YES THAT CERTAINLY FROM OUR STANDPOINT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING ARETHE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALLOCATED IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTED LOCAL EFFORTS- IF PRIMARILY LOOKING AT COURT COORDINATION TO IMPROVE BETWEEN THE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SYSTEMS- RELINQUISHMENT SO THAT AGAIN NO MATTER HOW YOU GET PROHIBITED. THERE'S AN EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY'LL BE FOLLOW THROUGH AND FOLLOW THROUGH THAT INCLUDES INFORMING RESTRAINED PERSONS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN COMPLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEY DON'T IT IS YOUR YOUR INITIAL- DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE- INVOLVING A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SITUATION I WOULD WANT THAT INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE BEEN INFORMED ABOUT THE PROHIBITION. TO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEY COULD COMPLY- IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE I UPON RELEASE OR SO FORTH AND THEN- MAKE SURE THAT% THEY UNDERSTOOD WHY THAT% INFORMATION MIGHT BE SHARED AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. IF THEY DID NOT COMPLY BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF SB THREE TWENTY IS ENSURING THAT RESTRAIN PARTIES GET EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO LOCALLY RELINQUISH AND COMPLY TO AVOID UNNECESSARY EXPOSURE TO THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND AVOID THIS DELAY THAT PUT THEIR BODY AT RISK. I. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH I AGREE WITH THAT LAST SENTIMENT ENTIRELY IN IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT WAS IT WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS REALLY SCARED TO DEATH- JUST HAD BEEN DISCHARGED RECENTLY WAS NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING. WHY YOU KNOW ARMED FOLKS WERE AT HIS HOUSE YOU KNOW ASKING HIM ALL THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN NO PRIOR. THE. INFORMATION EDUCATION ABOUT. ANY CREDIBLE AND REALLY WHO WHO WAS CLEAR IN IN HOW. CAME ACROSS WHICH IS WHICH IS WHY ACTUALLY- REACHED OUT TO- THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES TO HAVE A TALK THEM AND FIND OUT WHY THEY WERE BEHAVING THAT WAY- BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HOPEFULLY. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY OR SOMEHOW DOJ CAN COME IN FOR. AUGMENTATION AS WELL SO THAT THINGS ARE WORKING ON YOU KNOW HITTING ON ALL CYLINDERS HERE THANK YOU. OKAY IN NEWMAN ANYTHING I JUST ONE LAST THING I DO I THINK TO- MISTER LOWEST POINT OF THE YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA'S ON RAISE YOUR FILES ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THOSE WHO HAVE PURCHASED PERHAPS LEGALLY A FIREARM GOING TO PURCHASE AN ASTOUNDING NUMBER OF ILLEGAL FIREARMS AND WE ARE DOING A TERRIBLE JOB- IN TRACKING THOSE GENERALLY BUT BUT OBVIOUSLY SEIZING THEM WHEN THE TIME IS PERMITS YOU TO MISS WEBBER'S POINT OF YOU KNOW ANY RESOURCES WE CAN PROVIDE FOR BETTER FOLLOW UP FOR BETTER SYSTEMIC APPROACH- HE DO YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO THAT AND SO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A SMALL DOWN PAYMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU. WILL I ALSO DID WAY OF THE- FACTS HERE THAT WAS MOST. IMPRESSIVE IS- THIS IS THE ABSENCE ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO LEGALLY PURCHASED OR REGISTER THE FIREARMS BUT THEN IT BECAME PROHIBITIVE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO OWNER OR POSSESS THAT WENT FROM TEN THOUSAND TO ALMOST TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND ALL GUNS OUT THERE THAT WERE LEGALLY BOUGHT. LEGALLY REGISTERED BUT BECAME- THOSE INDIVIDUALS- WERE NOT PROHIBITED THAT'S A LOT OF THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH GUNS IT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEMSELVES OF MISS WEBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR WORK WE'RE GOING TO BE TRY TO BE AS HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE ON THIS ISSUE THAT YOU'RE CHAMPIONING THANK YOU MISTER LINDLEY AS WELL FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK- NEED THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS WILL. MOVE ON. ISSUE FIVE OF VICTIM SERVICES- MISS THE CITY WAS GOING TO PRESENT THAT IS THAT MISS PETERS. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUSTIN PETERS WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND STAFF HAS ASKED- I ASKED TO BRIEFLY INTRODUCE. THIS I'M THIS ITEM DOES SENATE IS CONSIDERING PROPOSALS TO EXPAND SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF CRIME. THE PROPOSAL IS BEING CONSIDERED TODAY INCLUDE AN IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM VARIOUS CHANGES TO ELIGIBILITY AND COMPENSATION LIMITS FOR THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM. ADDITIONAL RIGHT FOR THE RESTITUTION FUND AND FUNDING TO EXPAND SERVICES LIKE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS YOUR AGENDA LAYS OUT INFORMATION ON AND BACKGROUND ON THE STATE'S VICTIMS PROGRAM CITIES PROPOSALS EACH FIVE WOMEN AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE I'M OTHER FOLKS AT THE- HEARING TODAY THAT WILL SPEAK TO MARK THE TENTH. THANK YOU. THANK U. S. B. OF WE WELCOME ED LEE FROM CA SURVEY FOR. AND JUSTICE GOOD MORNING MISTER LITTLE. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS MY NAME IS A LITTLE AND I AM A GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER FOR CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE JUSTICE FIESTAS J. THE FLAGSHIP PROGRAM OF ALLIANCE FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. REPRESENTS A GROWING NETWORK OF MORE THAN NINETY THOUSAND FROM SURVIVORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN TWELVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA SURVIVORS. ADVOCATING FOR NEW SAFETY SOLUTIONS. CS IS J. BELIEVE THAT ALSO BY THE AND SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRAUMA RECOVERY. CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO CRIME SURVIVORS. AND TO ADVANCE NEW PUBLIC SAFETY AGENDA RUTIN HEALING. FIERCEST J. HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS WERE MOVING LONG MARGINALIZED SURVIVOR VOICES TO THE CENTER OF THIS CONVERSATION IMPACTED BY VIOLENCE EVERY YEAR THE STATE MUST DO MORE TO ADDRESS THE SCALE OF THE NEEDS EXISTING IN THE DISCRIMINATORY BARRIERS TO SUPPORT. WE APPLAUD THE SENATE FOR CONSIDERING THE VICTIM SERVICES PROPOSAL FROM YOU TODAY. THE BURDEN OF VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION. IS NOT BORNE EQUALLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MARGINALIZED SURVIVORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DENIED HEALTH. NATIONALLY ROUGHLY ONE INCHES SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE RECEIVE DIRECT ASSISTANCE FROM A VICTIM SERVICE AGENCY. EIGHT TWENTY NINETEEN SURVEY OF CALIFORNIA CRIME SURVIVORS FOUND THAT ONLY BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AFTER THE EXPERIENCE CRIME. SURVIVORSERIES HELP FOLLOWING THE VICTIMIZTION. THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE IT FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY FOR A HOSPITAL THEN FROM THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM STUDIES SHOW THE SURVIVORS OVERWHELMINGLY NEED SUPPORT MEETING BASIC NEEDS FOLLOWING A CRIME. PROVIDING FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SURVIVORS CAN HELP SURVIVORS STABLE THAT. TO GET TO SAFETY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING PTSD. WITHOUT SUPPORT SURVIVORS MAY HAVE TO SCRAMBLE TO RAISE FUNDS TO COVER CRITICAL EXPERIENCE EXPENSES WHILE TRAUMATIZED READ OR NOT GET THE HELP THEY NEED AT ALL. ACCEPTABLE FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF HEALING AND RECOVERY AND SHOULD BE CENTRAL TO A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO SUPPORT SURVIVORS. THE SUPPORTS COMPLIMENT OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS INCLUDING ACCESSIBLE FROM RECOVERY SERVICES HOUSING EMPLOYMENT AND IMMIGRATION PROTECTIONS RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS AND OTHER PATHWAYS TO HEALING FOR SURVIVORS. DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE EXPENDITURES OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES THE MAJORITY OF TERM SURVIVORS DO NOT RECEIVE SUPPORT TO HELP THEM RECOVER FROM HARM. THE STATE SPENDING ON VICTIM SERVICES REPRESENT ABOUT 1% OF WHAT THE STATE SPENDS ON THE PRISON SYSTEM. IN OTHER WORDS CALIFORNIA SPENDS NEARLY EIGHTY TIMES MORE ON PRISONS THEN ARMED SERVICES FOR CRIME SURVIVORS. WELL CALIFORNIA'S VICTIMS COMPENSATION. PROGRAM IS IN MANY WAYS A NATIONAL LEADER SURVIVORS ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION STILL FACE HURDLES ACCESS. THOUSANDS OF PLANES ARE DENIED EACH YEAR A RECENT ANALYSIS HAS FOUND THAT THE TYPES OF COMPENSATION ELIGIBILITY RESTRICTIONS CALIFORNIA HAVE. INCLUDING CONVICTION BASED RESTRICTIONS THE KNOWLEDGE OF ALLEGED LACK OF COOPERATION AND RESTRICTIONS BASED ON THE LATEST VICTIM CONTRIBUTION TO VICTIMIZATION. CONTRIBUTE TO AN EQUITABLE RATES OF THE NILES FOR OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE. FIFTY THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE FIERCE IS J. ISN'T SUPPORT OF THE VICTIM SERVICES BUDGET. PROPOSALS PUT FORTH BY THE SAME WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE PROVIDE LOCALIZED FLEXIBLE EMERGENCY CASH ASSISTANCE TO DIRECTLY SUPPORT SURVIVORS. EIGHT TWENTY NINETEEN SURVEY FROM CALIFORNIA FROM SURVIVORS FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF WOULD HAVE WARRANTED WE NEVER RECEIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE CURRENT. STEADY CHAU SURVIVES THE VIOLENT CRIMES PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME SURVIVORS OVERWHELMINGLY NEEDS TO FOR MEETING BASIC NEEDS FOLLOWING THE CRIME. PROVIDING FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SURVIVORS CAN HELP SURVIVORS STABILIZE AND GET TO SAFETY. THE STATE'S VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM IS ONE TWO. BUT DUE TO VARIOUS DECIDE SURVIVORS EVER ACCESS THESE PHONES. EVEN THOUGH SURVIVORS WHO MAKE MUST NAVIGATE OVERWHELMINGLY PAPERWORK AND RESTRICTIONS THAT MIMIC THE CURRENT RESOURCES THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. MAYBE COME TO DISCOURAGE IN THE OPT OUT ALTOGETHER. THE PROGRAM ALSO MOVES SLOWLY MISTER BARBER NEEDS ARE OFTEN URGE. IT CAN TAKE MANY MONTHS FOR SURVIVORS TO GET THE ASSISTANCE FROM THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. LOCAL IMMEDIATE NEEDS I'M FUNDS FOR DIRECT CASH ASSISTANCE IDEALLY BASED INTERESTED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS CAN SUPPLEMENT COMPENSATION AND FLEXIBLY SERVES SURVIVORS WHO ARE MORE MOST AND LEAST SUPPORTED BY EXISTING SYSTEMS. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ROOTED IN COMMUNITIES MOST HARMED BY VIOLENCE AND LEAST SUPPORTED BY THE LEGAL SYSTEM ARE UNIQUELY EQUIPPED TO GET FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO THE SURVIVORS WHO NEED THE MOST QUICKLY. REGARDING THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRESS. TOO OFTEN BURDENSOME RED TAPE MEANS THAT EVEN SURVIVORS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR APPROVED MAY NOT GET THE HELP THEY NEED THIS BY CALIFORNIA BEING THE STATE WITH THE SECOND LARGEST COST OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIANS COMPENSATION PROGRAM LESS THAN NEARLY EVERY OTHER IN THE COUNTRY IN COMPENSATION TO SURVIVORS PER APPLICATION APPROVED IN A YEAR. THIS IS IN LARGE PART IS BECAUSE MOST SURVIVORS WHO HAVE AN APPLICATION APPROVED NEVER ACTUALLY SUCCESSFULLY SUBMIT A BILL FOR REIMBURSEMENT. THE REIMBURSEMENT BASED MODEL FOR MANY EXPENSE SINCE SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK FOR SURVIVORS WHO DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR EMERGENCY OR UNEXPECTED COSTS LIKE FUNERALS. OR RE ALLOCATION OF FROM. WHEN WE LAUNCHED OUR WE ARE SURVIVORS CAMPAIGN WE FOUND VICTIMS AS YOUNG AS SEVEN YEARS OF. FUNDRAISING TO PAY FOR FUNERAL EXPENSES THIS IS DEHUMANIZING. AN OVERWHELMING PAPERWORK AND LONG PROCESSING TIMES MEANS THAT MANY SURVIVORS BECOME DISCOURAGED OPT OUT ALTOGETHER. JACKSON EXPENSES THAT HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH ACTUAL CROSS ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK REQUIRED FOR URGENT NEEDS LIKE REALLOCATION AND LIMITS ON ELIGIBILITY FOR LOSS OF INCOME OR SUPPORT MEANS SURVIVORS AND THEIR LOVED ONES OFTEN CANNOT GET THE HELP THEY NEED FROM THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. IN ADDITION THE WAY THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM IS FUNDED IS ALSO A MASSIVE STAND WHEN THE LONG TERM. INSTITUTION FUND THAT PROVIDES THE MAJORITY OF FUNDING FOR THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM AS IN RECENT YEARS SPENT MORE THAN IT HAS TAKEN IN. THE STATE HAS BACKED FEEL SOME OF THOSE LAWS WITH GENERAL FUNDS IT HAS NOT RETHOUGHT THE OVERALL MODEL FOR FUNDING. CALIFORNIA MUST COMMIT TO FULLY FUNDING THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM WITH GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. LASTLY THE STATE MUST REPLACE. TRUMP RECOVERY AT THE CENTER OF THE STATE'S HUMAN STRATEGY. TRUMP RECOVERY CENTERS REACH SURVIVORS WHO DO NOT TYPICALLY ACCESS TRADITIONAL VICTIM SERVICES INCLUDING ON HOW SURVIVORS JUSTICE INVOLVES SURVIVORS SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS MEMBERS OF THE IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE GROUPS SURVIVORS OF COLOR LGBTQ SURVIVORS ANOTHER HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS. WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN CURRENT GOVERNORS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THIS STATE HAS TAKEN STEPS TO BETTER SUPPORT FROM RECOVERY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE EIGHTEEN FROM RECOVERY CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THOSE EIGHTEEN DRUM RECOVERY CENTERS ARE MAINLY CONCENTRATED IN EIGHT OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. LARGER IS OF THE STATE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TRAUMA HUMAN SERVICES. THE STATE CAN EXPAND LOCAL CAPACITY AND GET FROM RECOVERY SERVICES TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST. THROUGH MULTIPLE POINTS OF ENTRY. THE PROPOSAL THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS CONSIDERING WOULD SURELY MAKE CALIFORNIA A NATIONAL LEADER IN SUPPORTING OUR STATE'S CRIME SURVIVORS WE STAND READY TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER LITTLE APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND- A VERY VERY MUCH AND- YOUR INSIGHT THAT YOU PROVIDED- NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JESS AND ANNIE NICHOL. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRMAN SENATORS. WE ARE JACKSON ANY NICKEL AND WE'RE GOING TO BE READING OUR TESTIMONY TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR HEARING ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE KIDNAPPED FROM HER BEDROOM AND MURDERED IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AT THE AGE OF TWELVE. I WAS ALSO TWELVE YEARS OLD IN POLAND'S KIDNAPPING AND SEX. LOSING POLY IN THE WAY THAT WE DID WAS INCREDIBLY DESTABILIZING AND TRAUMATIZING. AND AS CHILDREN TO HAVE A STRANGER COMING TO OUR HOME AND TAKE OUR SISTER FROM US. TORE APART THE FABRIC OF OUR REALITY IRREVOCABLY. AT VERY YOUNG AGES WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE DARKEST SIDE OF HUMANITY WHICH IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT HAS SENT A SHOCKWAVE THROUGH OUR LIVES TO THIS VERY DAY. WHEN YOU'VE EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE TO VIOLENCE IT TOUCHES EVERY AREA OF YOUR LIFE. YOUR RELATIONSHIPS OR FRIENDSHIPS. YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT YOURSELF AND EVERYONE AROUND YOU THIS IS NOT JUST FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME A LOSS LIKE THIS CHANGES THE WAY YOU VIEW THE WORLD FOREVER. WE EXPERIENCED YEARS OF FINANCIAL INSTABILITY AFTER TRAUMA WHICH FORCED US TO RELOCATE FREQUENTLY. I ATTENDED FIVE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN MY FIRST TWO YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE I DROPPED OUT AND STARTED ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN. AND AS IS TRUE SO MANY SURVIVORS WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AFTER A DEVASTATING LOSS. THAT INSTABILITY AND LACK OF SAFETY FOLLOWED US WHEREVER E WENT. WE SAY ALL OF THIS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN HOW VICTIMS OF CRIME NEED ONGOING RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. QALBI CB IS THE ONLY PLACE MANY VICTIMS CAN TURN TO TRY TO HEAL AND RECOVER FROM TRAUMA OR TO RELOCATE OR SECURE HOUSING FOR THEIR FAMILY. WHICH IS WHY THE WORK IT DOES IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE COMPARED TO MOST OF EXTENSIVE CRIME ANNE AND I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF PRIVILEGE. WE'VE NEVER HAD TO NAVIGATE SO MANY OF THE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS TO ACCESS THAT MANY OTHER VICTIMS FACE. WHERE AS MANY VICTIMS MUST FIGHT TO PROVE THAT HARM WAS DONE TO THEM AND THAT THEY'RE DESERVING OF SUPPORT. ANNE AND I HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED AS VICTIMS SINCE THE DAY WE LOST QUALITY. OUR FAMILY RECEIVED AN OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY WHEN MANY SURVIVORS ON THE WRIST EVEN RECEIVE THE MOST BASIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THEIR LOST INCLUDING YOUR COMPENSATION FUNDS. EVEN SO WE HAVE BOTH EXPERIENCED BARRIERS IN OUR ATTEMPTS TO SEEK OUT SUPPORT FROM COUNTY CV. OUR DEGREE OF PRIVILEGE HEIGHTENS OUR CONCERNS EVEN MORE FOR THE MANY MANY SURVIVORS WHO HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FROM SEEKING OUT THE SUPPORT THEY NEED AND DESERVE. BECAUSE IF IT WAS THAT CHALLENGING FOR US TO NAVIGATE WE IMAGINE THAT IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR FOLKS WITH FAR LESS PRIVILEGED AND PUBLIC VALIDATION. IN TERMS OF OUR SPECIFIC EXPERIENCES INTERACTING WITH THE B. C. B. WE'LL SHARE SOME OF THE STORIES NOW TO OFFER A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE CHALLENGES HAVE ARISEN FOR US. IN RECENT YEARS I PERSONALLY SPENT MONTHS GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THE VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD PROMPTED BY SOME PAINFUL SITUATIONS THAT AROSE RELATED TO POLLY'S CASE. EVEN THOUGH I'D BEEN GIVEN A CLAIM AS A CHILD I WAS ASKED TO RESUBMIT MY APPLICATION MULTIPLE TIMES AND THEN TOLD THAT MY FORMS WERE NOT VIEWABLE FOR REASONS RANGING FROM LAPTOP ERRORS TO THE COUNTY FIREWALL. USUALLY TOOK AT LEAST TWO OR THREE FOLLOW UP EMAILS TO GET A RESPONSE FROM PCB OVER MANY MONTHS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH. THE LACK OF TRAUMA SENSITIVITY IN THE RESPONSES I RECEIVED LEFT ME FEELING HOPELESS AND WORSEN THE PEOPLE SITUATION I WAS AND- AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS I LEARNED THAT MY ORIGINAL CLAIM HAD ALREADY ALREADY BEEN AUTHORIZED FOR AND NUMBER COUNSELING SESSIONS. BUT I NEVER BEEN MADE AWARE OF THAT I WAS LEFT WAITING UNNECESSARILY DURING ALL THOSE MONTHS NOT SURE HOW TO MOVE MY APPLICATION FORWARD OR IF MY CLEAN WILL BE HONORED AT A TIME WHEN I BADLY NEEDED SUPPORT. BY THE TIME MY FAMILY FINALLY MANAGED TO ECEIVE MY REIMBURSEMENT I HAD ALREADY USED UP ALL OF MY DESIGNATED COUNSELING SESSIONS FOR THE TREATMENT PLAN APPROVED BY ANY BY B. C. B. MY OPTIONS WERE THAN TO REAPPLY FOR FURTHER B. C. B. SUPPORT WHICH ONLY COVERED ABOUT HALF THE COST OF MY COUNSELING. OR TO FIND THE FUNDS TO PAY OUT OF POCKET AND FORWARD. IN THE END I FOUND MY EXPERIENCE WITH PCB SO PAINFUL AND FRUSTRATING THAT I DECIDED NOT TO UTILIZE THE PROGRAM AGAIN. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE SEARCH EFFORTS WERE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AFTER EXPERIENCING A SEVERE TRAUMA. THE MARKET RIGHT FOR THEIR- IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE BASELINE EIGHTY ONE DOLLAR REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNT THROUGH THE CITY. AND HIGHLY SKILLED FROM A THERAPIST TYPICAL COST FAR MORE. THIS LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE PLACES UNDUE BURDENS ON VICTIMS TO FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL ACCEPT SUCH A LOW COST FOR THEIR SERVICES. OR TO BE IN A POSITION OF ASKING A THERAPIST TO TAKE LESS MONEY FOR THEIR HEALING SERVICES. PERSONALLY I HAVE HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH THERAPISTS TO ACCEPT LESS MONEY TO HELP ME HEAL WHICH IS AN AWFUL POSITION TO BEGIN- THOSE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS ARE ALWAYS. HARD AND AWKWARD BUT- WHEN I'M IN A PLACE OF DESPERATION FOR HELP. RECESSION ABOUT MONEY WITH THE THERAPIST IS THE LAST THING I WANT TO HAVE TO DO. THE ENORMOUS GAP BETWEEN WHAT I COULD OFFER COMPARED TO THE FEES TO THERAPISTS TYPICALLY CHARGE. LEFT ME WITH A SENSE OF SHAME WHICH COMPOUNDED THE DIFFICULTIES OF OBTAINING SUPPORT AND NEED MY HEALING JOURNEY HARDER- ADDITIONALLY WHEN I WAS TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE B. C. B. SYSTEM I WAS GIVEN CONFLICTING INFORMATION BY DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT TWO SEPARATE ISSUES. WHEN I CALLED A SUPERVISOR FOR CLARIFICATION MY COMMUNICATION WASN'T EVER RETURNED- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS TO BE AWARE OF IN A SYSTEM LIKE THIS AND THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE CAN BE MISINFORMED BUT THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE HIGHER STAKES THAN MOST. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY TALKING TO VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS ON THE PHONE SHOULD BE TOTALLY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE MOST ACCURATE. AND UP TO DATE INFORMATION TO HELP US ACCESS SUPPORT- AND ALSO SOMETHING THAT HAS WEIGHED HEAVILY ON ME OVER THE YEARS IS WHETHER I'D FIND OUT IF THE PERSON WHO KILLED POLY. HAD ANY SORT OF STATUS CHANGE WHILE IN PRISON. LIKE DEATH OR TRANSFER TO ANOTHER PRISON OR WHETHER THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY OF A RE TRIAL. I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL TWO WEEKS AGO. ABOUT THE CDCR INMATE LOCATOR. AND THAT WE COULD BE NOTIFIED IF THERE WERE ANY STATUS CHANGES. AND THIS SPEAKS TO THE LACK OF RESOURCES PUT INTO EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT AVAILABLE THAT CAN SERVICES. WHEN A PERSON HAS EXPERIENCED THE WORST THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN TO THEM. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO NAVIGATE MOUNTAINS OF PAPERWORK OR ENGAGE WITH THE SYSTEM THAT IS INHERENTLY SKEPTICAL OF WHETHER THEIR PAIN IS REAL. MOST OF US CAN ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES WHEN WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF SURVIVING A LOSS LIKE THAT. IT IS EVEN MORE PAINFUL TO TRY TO OBTAIN SUPPORT THREE SYSTEM THAT VIEWS ARE HEARTBREAK WITH SUSPICION. TOO OFTEN THESE BARRIERS BECOMING RE TRAUMATIZING EXPERIENCE THAT TEACHES VICTIMS NOT TO SEEK OUT SUPPORT IN THE FIRST PLACE. MY EXPERIENCE WITH PCB FELT LIKE A BATTLING IT TO FIGHT ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER BATTLE SURVIVORS MUST INTO OUR DAILY TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES. AFTER THOSE MONTHS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH COUNTY CITY. DISTINCTLY FELT BUT THE SYSTEM THAT WAS DESIGNED WITH GREATER EMPHASIS ON PREVENTING FUNDS FROM BEING GIVEN TO SOMEONE IT DEEMS UNDESERVING. RATHER THAN A SYSTEM FUNDAMENTALLY BUILT TO SUPPORT THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM NEEDS OF VICTIMS. NOT ONLY DOES THIS WORK AGAINST THE PEOPLE COUNTY CD WAS CREATED TO SUPPORT THEIR COMPROMISES COULD PUBLIC SAFETY I PUT. ALL WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED A DEATH IN LOSS INTO EVEN MORE DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES. TRAUMA FROM VIOLENCE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN THIS COUNTRY AND- VICTIMS COMPENSATION IS ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS THAT EXIST TO ADDRESS IT. AS THE VICTIMS OF SUCH A HIGH PROFILE CASE TO JESS AND I ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE NETWORKS OF SUPPORT THAT MOST SURVIVORS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO ENSURE THAT OUR FELLOW SURVIVORS HAVE ALL THE HELP YOU NEED BECAUSE THERE IS NO. GREATER FORCE FOR SAFETY IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE ABILITY TO HEAL RECOVER. FROM TRAUMA. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU AT THANK YOU JESSON ANNIE. REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME. OUT NOT ONLY SHARE WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN- BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY IS HOW YOU BECOME ADVOCATES YOURSELF. INSPIRED OF GOING THROUGH ALL OF THIS- PAINFUL- PAINFUL MEMORIES- AT THIS POINT DOUG MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NO I JUST YOU KNOW THANKS AGAIN TO THE WITNESSES. THAT IS IMPRESSIVE RETURN TRASH UNIT ADVOCACY SO WE WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT.

ONE TIME THAT WAS AVAILABLE OVER YEAR- THE BY INCLUDES SEVEN EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ON A ONE TIME BASIS ON THE END SO THAT THAT ONE TIME FUNDING WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS CURRENT BUDGET YEAR AND SO I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SPEAKERS ON TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THAT THE MERITS AS POSSIBLE CONTINUING THIS PROGRAM I'M IN THE BUDGET YEAR OR BEYOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES WE WILL MOVE ON NOW TO- OUR WITNESSES SU ELIZABETH CARING FROM THE CITY OF STAUNTON. MORNING INSURANCE SENATORS- MY NAME IS C. K. AND I AM WITH THE CITY SENSE AND BUT ON SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT FOR THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY COLLABORATIVE- YES WE THE KEY WORD HERE IS THAT IT WAS A PILOT FOUR YEARS AGO. AND THUS FAR- ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL PRIMARY FOUNDATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT WE SET FORTH WAS ACCOUNTABILITY WITH RESULTS. SO WE STARTED WITH DATA IN THE AREA OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. WE WENT OUT AND SOUGHT OUT EIGHT FINING REGISTRY REAL HOMELESS CENSUS BACK IN SPRING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND WE COUNTED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE HERE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY. AND ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR OF THEM PROVIDED US WITH THEIR PERSONAL DEMOGRAPHIC NAMES AND INFORMATION AND SINCE THEN WE HAVE THE BALLING THEM OVER SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY HOUSE. WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWENTY FOUR I ENGAGE IN CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. HE WENT ON WITH THE STATE AT TWO HUNDRED ON A TECHNOLOGY TOOL I'LL WE DISCOVERED A SOFTWARE COMPANY CALLED OUT EACH FOR IT. WHERE IS A SINGULAR PLATFORM WITH A UNIFIED RESPONSIBILITY OF IT RESPONDING TO CALLS FOR SERVICES RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS AND- MENTAL ILLNESS. AND SUBSTANCE USE THAT'S IN OUR STREETS. AND SO WITH THIS OP- THEY ADDED FEATURES LIKE A BAD SELTZER RESERVATIONS SO WITH THE TAP OF ONE. FEATURE ON YOUR PHONE- YOU CAN RESERVE. AT ONE OF OUR THREE NAVIGATION CENTERS- IN ADDITION TO. BE THAT WAS FEINSTEIN THAT BACHELOR RESERVATION BY THE WAY IS TEN MINUTES SO YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A BAD ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A PERSON ON THE STREET WHO. WAS WILLING TO TAKE A SHELTER. I ON TOP THAT WE HAVE ADDED A FEATURE WHERE IT YOU'RE OF THE- A VETERAN ORGAN CALLED L. L. IS NOTED. AND THEIR OWN RESOURCE AND SPECIALIST OUT AND WORK WITHIN. WHO EXPERIENCED HOMELESS PILOT IS IT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REPLICATE ELSEWHERE SO THEY GOING TO BEACH THE CITY REALLY GOING TO BEACH THE WHICH- AS- CITY DOWN IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY. HAVE TAKEN ON THEIR OWN OUT OF REACH FOR IT AND- BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SHELTER. AND THEY ARE ROBUSTLY USING- OUT RESTRICTS YOU GET THESE FOLKS WITH RESOURCES AND HOUSING AS WELL AS SELTZER- EN ELEMENTARY JUST ON TO- I'M TAKING A COMPONENT OF OUR MODEL AND AGAIN. OUTRAGE WORKERS WORKING ON ON THIS APP. MORE IMPORTANTLY I AFTER FOR YEARS- WE HAD AND THE IS THE NUMBER THAT GOING TO PROVIDE. WE HAD OVER FIFTY ONE COMMUNITY BASED ON. WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED FOR ONE PROJECT- IN THE AREAS OF YOUTH VIOLENCE PREVENTION INTERVENTION- HOMELESS OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS REENTRY SERVICES. AT THE CULMINATION OF THAT IN THIS CURRENT YEAR WITH THE SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS THE HOPE CENTER AND THEN A HALF CHIEF DOWN HERE WHO'S GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HELP CENTER. GREAT MORNING THAT OCCURRED ONE OF THE SENATORS- BUT DILIGENTLY CITY FORT AND ALSO THE CHAIR. OF THE COLLABORATIVE THIS YEAR- SO ASK YOU INDICATED. WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE SUPPORT OF THE STATE THE LAST FOUR NOW FIVE YEARS. AND AS WE HAVE NAVIGATED THROUGH FUNDING CYCLES. THE CITIES THAT PARTICIPATED THIS ALL ELEVEN OF US NOW- HAVE TRIED TO LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING RESOURCES IN A MORE REGIONAL WAY. SO THAT WE CAN WHAT WE CALL PROVIDE THE RIGHT SERVICE RIGHT NOW. TO THOSE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND THAT'S WHERE THE CONCEPT OF THE HOPE CENTER WHICH STANDS FOR. ALMOST OUR REGION CORRECTIVE ENGAGEMENT. OR NOT. THE LOCATION HERE IN THE CITY OF FORT AND WHERE ALL THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO ARE OPERATING IN OUR AREAS IN OUR CITIES. WILL CALM DOWN PROVIDE SYNERGISTIC SERVICES TO OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. ODDS TO MENTION SOME OF OUR PARTNERS WERE SIGNED ON P. O. L. A. SO WE CAN. MAKE SURE WE TOUCH OUR VETERANS OF THE WAY THAT. MOST AFFECTED. I ALSO HAVE HAD ENCOURAGING. WITH CAL. WAS THE MATTER MISS- FOR THE COUNTY OF TO BE PARTING US. WE ARE GOING TO LAUNCH A COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC PRO IS A REALLY TO THAT. AND OF THIS ENERGY THAT BEEN CREE AROUND THESE THREE FOCUS AREAS IS REALLY A DIRECT RESULT OF. THE FOR THE FOURTH OUT OF THE STATE TO HELP US LAUNCH THESE PROJECTS. OUR ABILITY TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. ALL OF WHICH RECEIVE 60% OF THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE FROM THE STATE ONLY OF THE CITY. BECAUSE WE REALIZE WE NEED TO GET THE RIGHT RESOURCES RIGHT NOW TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND- WE ARE. PLEASED BY THE THOUGHT THAT THIS CONTINUE WE'RE HOPING AND ARE SUPPORTED OF COURSE OF THE CONTINUANCE OF THIS. AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING REAL RESULTS HERE AND THE OF THE OF OUR ABILITY TO DUPLICATE THESE IN AREAS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO. AND ALL THE OTHER AREAS THAT YOU MENTIONED- THROUGH THE USE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY TOOL I THINK HE IS GETTING US BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THOSE. EXPERIENCING HOT DISTROS WHO. AS THE VIOLENCE THAT WE CAN GET TO A MENTOR BEFORE THEY GET THERE. THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO ADDITIONAL- HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR COLLABORATIVE WHICH IS ONE- I GOING AGAIN GOING BACK TO ACCOUNTABILITY WITH RESULTS- WE CONTRACTED WITH CAL STATE FULLERTON WITH THEIR SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER AND THEY HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWING AND EVALUATING AND US. FOR THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AND ON OUR WEBSITE TWO PURPOSES FOR OUR WEBSITE SO THAT OTHERS COULD SEE FROM OTHER RE- REPLICATE. SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR MODEL AND THEN ALSO. RFP PROCESS OF- GETTING FUNDING 260% THAT SHE'S DONE I SPOKE NEVADA IT IS 60% WHILE IT IS TRUE WE PROVIDED ACTUALLY MORE THAN 60% BECAUSE WE HAD THESE ASKING BUILDING WORKSHOPS. AND WHAT THEY ARE IS A WORKSHOPS FOR OUR CEOS WE'VE HAD CBO SAID LITERALLY I WORKED OUT OF THE GARAGES AND THE- NATIONALS. US SO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE WE THREE EIGHT TWO BOYS AND CLUB. OF AND THE LOCAL. OR BIG BROTHERS BIG SISTERS. AT LEAST COMPASSIONATE BUILDING WORKSHOPSWAS FOR REALLY ONE PURPOSE THAT AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS OR FIVE YEARS THAT THEY'RE MUCH MORE BOYS AS AN ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION FOR CAPACITY. TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OUTSIDE OF THE COLLABORATIVE. SO WE'VE HAD GRANT MKING MARKETING- FOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC VISIONING. WHAT THAT REALLY WALKING THE DOCUMENT THAT REALLY WAS THE ARTICLE CO COLLABORATION WHICH IS A SYMPOSIUM. HELD DURING THE PANDEMIC IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN PERSON ALTHOUGH WE DID YES DO AND WE HAD OUR TAYLOR AND NATIONAL PHILANTHROPIC LEADER WHO CAME OUT AND TALKED ABOUT COLLABORATION. AND WHAT HE ADDRESSED U. S. AS HE WAS-STUDYING THIS COLLABORATIVE MODEL WAS THAT. INDICATOR THAT WE- AND STARTED A NEW THAT. IN CHARGE. AND THAT NEW VALUE IS NOT WORN OUT OF DESPERATION BUT I'D OF INNOVATION TO COLLABORATE TOGETHER SO THAT WE BUILD THIS BRIDGE BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OURCEOS- CEOS THAT DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY EXISTED AND WORK TOGETHER. SO WE HAVE AN ORGANIZATION CALLED CHRIS LISTS IT'S LARGELY OUT OF LA BUT THEY CAME INTO ORANGE COUNTY THEY PROVIDE- EMPLOYMENT SERVICES ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WELL CHRYSALIS- PARTNERED WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE A LARGE AMOUNT OF MEMBERS OF THOSE CLASSES THIS FAMILIES ARE UNDEREMPLOYED. AND CRYSTALLISED PARTNERED WITH OUR BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB WHICH IS THE BIG SEVEN BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME CLUBS. AND THEY STARTED WORKING THE WITH THE FAMILIES THAT INDICATED THAT THEY WANT TO IMPLEMENT BETTER THAN WHAT THEY HAVE NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE IT WAS UNINTENDED- BUT THROUGH THESE COLLABORATIVE WORKSHOPS- PARTNERSHIPS. FORMS WE THAT WE HAVE INTERNET ANYONE MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S GREAT TO HEAR ABOUT A- POSITIVE PROGRAM THAT'S WORKING- AND DON'T REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. I KNOW SIR NEWMAN VERY A PROUD IN THE EXCITED- IF I COULD JUST ASK ONE QUESTION- CHIEF DONE- CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE- DEPARTMENT'S. INTERACTIONS WITH THE ON THE HOUSE TO POPULATION HOW. YOU KNOW HAS THAT CHANGED- WHAT WHAT IS THAT RELATIONSHIP. I KNOW THAT SURE ISN'T A DIFFICULT PLACE FOR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. YES MA'AM AND I THINK- BUT THE BEAUTY OF THIS COLLABORATIVE IS THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME ABOUT MY DEPARTMENT BUT IT REALLY IS THE CONSENSUS ACROSS ELEVEN CITIES HERE IN THE NORTH SO ALL ELEVEN POLICE AGENCIES. HAVE KIND OF SHIFTED THE MINDSET OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INTO- SERVICES FIRST ENFORCEMENT LAST I THINK ALL OF US HERE ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHWESTERN AREA I UNDERSTAND FULLY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ARREST OUR WAY OUT OF ALMOST IS THE ISSUE. AND SO WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE PASSIONATE- RELATIONSHIP BUILDING APPROACH AND WE BUILD A REPORT WITH THE MOST MEMBERS IN ARCADIA EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO GET THE BEST OUTCOME FOR THEM BECAUSE THAT'S TRULY WHERE SUCCESS LIES NOT IN IN IN INCARCERATION OR EVEN CITATION. AND PUTTING SOMEONE INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SO BUT THE POSTURE THAT WE TAKE YEARS SERVICES FIRST ENFORCEMENT LAST AND THAT THAT'S WHY THAT I'LL REACH FOR TOOLS BEEN SO IMPORTANT FOR US BECAUSE- IT GIVES THAT PERSON YEAH INDIVIDUAL THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE FOUND THROUGH OUR PROCESS OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS IS THAT. THE EXPERIENCING HOMES JUST OUR INDIVIDUAL AND HOW THEY GOT THERE AN INDIVIDUAL OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THERE AND SO IF AN OFFICER WHO'S NEVER. THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL BEFORE COULD HAVE THEIR STORY IN FRONT OF THEM IT SERVE THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BRIDGE THAT REPORT GAP A LOT QUICKER OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER THIS IS IT THE CARD AND SO I THINK WHEN I WHEN I TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO HERE IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY. IS FOCUS ON THAT FIRST OF COURSE ENFORCED IS A TWO THAT WE CAN EMPLOY. BUT WE WANT TO BRING THOSE RESOURCES TO BEAR THAT'S GOING TO GET THAT PERSON TO A BETTER PLACE INTO A PLACE WHERE THEY WANT TO BE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR NEWMAN- I HAPPEN HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THIS. SO IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE I'M BY DIE KUNST I'M NOT SURE WE CAN SEE THAT THE CHIEF AND- MISS CAN'T. I AM VERY PROUD OF THIS FIVE YEAR EFFORT I AND I'M I'M PROUD ON YOUR BEHALF AND EYES YES ANYBODY KNOWS WHO KNOWS I'M JUST SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW A GOOD IDEA. WHEN I HEAR IT ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO OF A GROUP OF CITY MANAGER'S CHIEFS CAME. TO MY OFFICE IN THE THEY HAD AN IDEA THEY'D BE AND IT WAS BASED ON OBSERVATION THE OBSERVATION WAS THAT. THE EFFORTS AT LEAST LOCALLY RUN HOMELESSNESS HAD DEFIED- BE SORT OF MUNICIPAL EFFORTS RIGHT THAT THAT CITY LEVELED TO THE PROBLEM IS TOO BIG- TO ADDRESS KIND OF ON A CITY BY CITY BASIS AND AT THE STATE LEVEL- TOP DOWN SOLUTIONS DIDN'T REALLY WORK AND SO THE IDEA WAS WHAT IF WE COULD WE COULD. WE COULD CREATE. A REGIONAL APPROACH TO THAT USED AS ITS BASIS YOU KNOW THE RIGHT SIZE. UNIT AND THAT THAT STARTED AS EIGHT CITIES IS NOW ELEVEN. AND IT- VERY GRATEFUL TO SU GANG- TO CHIEF CORPORATION IS IT WHEN PARK JUST RETIRED- FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN AL CHIEF DONE FOR ASSUMING. WE SHOULD ROLL. OUT OF BED BUT AS MISS KING MENTIONED. YOU KNOW INNOVATIONS HERE WERE. THE THIS COLLAB. EFFORT LED TO INCREASE COORDINATION- BETTER ALIGNMENT BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY- THAT RESULTED IN A LIKE CAPACITY BUILDING BUT ALSO INNOVATION- AND SO NO NO SMALL THING. TO HAVE. CREATED THIS MOBILE PLATFORM WHICH IS SOLVING A VERY REAL PROBLEM EVERY SINGLE CITY HAS THE SAME PROBLEM ABOUT. CONNECTING ON HOUSE PEOPLE TO BEDS IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY GETS THEM INTO. A SAFE PLACE AND MOVE THEM FORWARD- AND SO YOU KNOW I HAVE A COMPANION BILL. SB FOURTEEN EIGHTEEN. WHICH WOULD. YOU KNOW KIND OF- INSTITUTIONALIZED JUST BROKE. IT BUT IT'S THE IDEA IS THIS IS A MODEL WHICH IS VERY WORTHY OF REPLICATION. AND FURTHER INNOVATION- AND- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THE MAN SPENT ON ON HOMELESSNESS- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IT'S IN THE BILLIONS AND SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS NORMALLY A- VERY GOOD RETURN. ON INVESTMENT. BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW A REALLY SOLID BASIS FOR IT FOR ENHANCING COLLABORATION AND ACTUALLY APPLYING THAT TO OTHER SYSTEMS. UP SO YOU KNOW BROUGH HOPEFUL- THAT WE CAN WE CAN INCLUDE THIS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- AND AGAIN VERY GRATEFUL. TO EVERYBODY. IN MY REGION WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS. AGAIN I I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WATCHING THIS INVOLVES- AND IT IS SPEND IMMENSELY GRATIFYING ENCOURAGING TO DO SO. THANK YOU. WHAT CAN ACTUALLY TO EVERYONE FOR THE PROGRESS IF YOU'VE MADE- WITH. ANY ANY OF SENATOR CRITICIZING IN- ANY OF ANY FINAL WERE EITHER WOULD JUST SAY WORK THREE THE STATE FOR BARBECUE THUS FAR WE HAVE REALLY WORKED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND FOR US AND- WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THAT AND WORK WITH OTHERS TO REPLICATE THIS THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A WINNING MODELS HERE. WHEN GREAT AT ALSO AND JUST THAT AND THE HOPE CENTER WILL BE OPEN. AND PLEASE COME ON DOWN YOU'RE NOT TOO FAR FROM US SACRAMENTO IS JUST A FLIGHT AWAY.
