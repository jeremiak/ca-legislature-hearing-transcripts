ARE YOU PREPARED BALL ITEM THIRTY FOUR MR SECRETARY PLEASE READ IN A RESOLUTION SIXTY FIVE US SENATOR JACKSON RELATIVE TO PAIN AWARENESS CENTER JACKSON FLOORS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS FLOOR HAS AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE EITHER PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED EXCRUCIATING PAIN OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS AND KNOWS HOW DEBILITATING IT CAN BE. NO MATTER HOW YOU TRY TO THINK IT'S MIND OVER MATTER. IT JUST ISN'T AND SO THIS IS A RESOLUTION THAT RECOGNIZES AND DECLARES THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER. AND AS PAIN AWARENESS MONTH AND SPECIFICALLY ALSO RECOGNIZES SEPTEMBER FIRST AS WOMEN IN PAIN AWARENESS DAY. NOW WE KNOW THAT MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION AMERICANS LIVE WITH CHRONIC PAIN CAUSED BY VARIOUS DISEASES OR DISORDERS AND NEARLY TWENTY FIVE MILLION AMERICANS SUFFER WITH ACUTE PAIN EACH YEAR. THOUGH WE NO MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TO RELIEVE OR GREATLY EASE SOME PAIN MOST TRADE MOST PAIN IS UNTREATED UNDER TREATED OR IMPROPERLY TREATED AS WE HAVE NOTED BY SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE. EXPERIENCE WITH THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC THAT EXISTS BUT THE PAIN IS REAL. THE PAIN IS REAL AND WE KNOW THAT MANY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ARE STILL UNAWARE OF HOW TO EFFECTIVELY TREAT THAT PAIN. WHO SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN OFTEN ARE STIGMATIZED MARGINALIZED AND NOT INFORMED OF THE RIGHT THAT THEY HAVE TO TRY TO SEEK AFFECTED PAIN ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT. AND MOST PEOPLE WITH PAIN INCLUDING THOSE SHOULD END OF LIFE GET LITTLE OR NO RELIEF WOMEN. HAVE A HIGHER PREVALENCE THAN MAN OF SYNDROMES AND DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC PAIN THINGS LIKE FIBROMYALGIA COMPLEX PAIN SYNDROME IN OSTEOARTHRITIS AND WE KNOW PEOPLE RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO CERTAIN ANALGESICS. WOMEN ARE MORE FREQUENT TWO IN REPORTING PAIN TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS BUT ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THEIR PAIN REPORTS DISCOUNTED AS EMOTIONAL OR CYCLE JANICK. AND THEREFORE NOT REAL. THIS TIME WE RECOGNIZED AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO ADDRESS WHAT IS A DEBILITATING CONDITION FOR SO MANY OF OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND ON OCCASION OURSELVES THAT IS WHAT THIS MEASURE DOES AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. IN IRAQ KNOWLEDGE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DAY IN THIS MONTH N. WOULD ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. ACTION OR DEBATE. CENTER STONE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF US ARE SIXTY FIVE AS A PHARMACIST THAT IS SPECIALIZED IN PAIN CONTROL NOW FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS THERE ARE A LOT OF MODALITIES OUT THERE THAT DO NOT INVOLVE NARCOTICS THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR COMPREHENSIVE PAIN CONTROL FOR PATIENTS AND THE ISSUE IS EDUCATING PATIENTS THAT. THERE ARE IN FACT PROFESSIONALS OUT THERE THAT CAN BE SEEN AND CAN RESPONSIBLY ADDRESS THEIR PAIN ISSUES NOBODY SHOULD BE LIVING IN PAIN IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE PLETHORA OF PAIN CONTROL DOCTORS THAT WE HAVE THESE ARE DOCTORS AND NOT ONLY HAVE THEIR MD DEGREE MOST OF IT ON THERE ANESTHESIOLOGY DEGREE AND THEN DO ANOTHER RESIDENCY. IN PAIN CONTROL. AND THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRESS BEING MADE IN THE PAIN AREA THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE UTILIZATION OF NARCOTICS. WE HAVE NEAR STIMULATOR CENTER USE MECHANICAL DEVICES IN THE SPINE THAT HELP PEOPLE HAVE SPINAL CORD PROBLEMS THERE IS A DRUG THAT'S BEEN UTILIZE IT HAS BEEN SHOWING A LOT OF PROMISE. COMMONLY KNOWN AS SNAIL SPIT IT ACTUALLY IS THE VENOM OF THE MOST POISONOUS NAIL FOUND IN THE OCEAN WHERE THEY'VE ISOLATED THE VENOM. THE DILUTED THE VENOM AND THEY FIND THAT HAS THE SAME PAIN RELIEVING CAPABILITIES AS MORPHINE. BUT WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF ADDICTION. SO THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT WE HAVE PAIN CONTROL SPECIALIST THAT EXISTS IN EVERY PART OF CALIFORNIA AND IF ONE FINDS THAT THEY'RE IN ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF PAIN THEY SHOULD GO SEE THE APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL THAT HAS A LOT OF TOOLS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY INCLUDE NARCOTICS AND FOR THOSE REASONS I SUPPORT SR SIXTY FIVE. THANK YOU CENTER STONE. JACKSON WOULD YOU CARE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE ON THE SAME SIDE WITH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE THE PHARMACISTS FROM TO MACULA. NOT NECESSARILY HAPPY TO FIND OUT WHAT SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVES ARE IT BUT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE GOOD PHARMACIST RECOGNIZES THAT THERE IS. POTENTIALLY TREATMENT OUT THERE. NOT ALWAYS BUT- WE KNOW WE MUST RECOGNIZE THE PAIN IS REAL AND CAN BE DEBILITATING THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION ATTEMPTS TO DO. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE MEDICAL STUDENTS NOW WE'RE GETTING MORE TRAINING IN PALLIATIVE CARE AND OTHER TYPES OF PAIN MANAGEMENT WE NEED TO DO MORE AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN WOMEN PRESENT WITH PAIN IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE IN PAIN. NOT PART SHOULD ALLIES OR DISMISS THAT PAIN. BUT TRY TO FIND A TREATMENT AND CURE THAT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE SO THAT WE CAN ALL LIVE HEALTHY HAPPY THRIVING AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES IN WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I VOTE.

MISTER PRESIDENT I APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES TO THE LEFT OF ME HERE BUT WANTED TO I STAND UP AND I RISE TO INTRODUCE. TO PRESENT A B. THREE SEVEN SEVEN WHICH IS A CLEAN UP BILL TO AB SIXTY SIX. WHICH ESTABLISHED MICRO ENTERPRISE HOME KITCHEN OPERATIONS AS A NEW TYPE OF RESTRICTED FOOD FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA. AB SIX TWO SIX PROVIDE THE CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THOUSANDS OF COOKS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TURN MEANINGFUL MEANINGFUL INCOME IN A MANNER THAT IS LEGAL AND SAFE. DESPITE AN EXTENSIVE THREE YEARS STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES HAVE COME TO LIGHT. A SINCE THE AUTHOR IS COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF A B. SIX TWO SIX HE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT AND TIMELY FOR US TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION. LEAD TO CONFUSION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THE LAW IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS IT. WHICH JURORS WHICH JURISDICTION IS ELIGIBLE TO OPT IN INTO THE PROGRAM HOW STANDARDS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY SHALL BE IMPLEMENTED TO PROTECT COOKS AND CONSUMERS. HOW INSPECTIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED. EXPECTATIONS FOR ADVERTISING AND CLEAR ARTICULATION OF THE FACT THE HOME KITCHEN OPERATORS CAN ONLY USE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY SERVICES TO DELIVER FOOD TO THE DISABLED. THE AUTHOR HAS HER CONCERN FROM SEVERAL CITIES AROUND THE STATE THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL WILL TAKE AWAY THEIR LIGHT TOO OFTEN. HOWEVER IT IS HIS POSITION THAT SUCH A RIGHT WAS NEVER THE INTENTION OF AB SIX TWO SIX. ARE THESE CHANGES WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE INTENT AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW ARE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD ACROSS ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN CARRIES AN URGENCY COST INSURE IT TAKES EFFECT IN TIME. TO ENSURE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. BOAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER HER TADO. ANY OTHER DISCUSS OR DEBATE. WE CONFIRM WHAT WHAT BILL NUMBER YOU'RE TALKING ON. EIGHTY THREE SEVEN SEVEN OKAY GREAT THAT'S PERFECT CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT TODAY I RISE IN OPPOSITION MAYBE THREE SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH SEEKS TO UNDO MUCH OF THE GOOD WORK DONE LAST YEAR BY EIGHTY SIX TWENTY SIX WHICH WERE CREATED MICRO ENTERPRISE HOME KITCHEN OPERATIONS. A TITLE ONLY A BUREAUCRAT COULD LOVE. HE'S IN GERMAN. WHEN WE WERE KIDS BACK BEFORE CALIFORNIA BECAME SUCH A NANNY STATE I'M NOT SURE HOW WE DIDN'T JUST KILL OVER AND DIE FROM MOM AND DAD'S HOME COOKING. LAST YEAR'S AB SIX TWENTY SIX RECOGNIZE THE GROWTH OF HOME. BASED KITCHEN INDUSTRIES ESTABLISH A NEW CATEGORY. OF RETAIL FOOD FACILITIES CALLED M. H. CASE FOR SHORT. THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION. TO AUTHORIZE AND PERMIT. OR TO BE OPERATED BY A PRIVATE A RESIDENT IN THEIR OWN PRIVATE HOME. THIS BILL HAD WIDE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT HECK I EVEN VOTED FOR IT BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY SUPPORTED THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT. THAT HAS MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT BUT IT ALSO LET. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES IF THEY WISH TO ALLOW MH KAYS WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES FOR INSTANCE. IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY OF MERRY AT OFFICIALS DECIDED PERMIT MH CASE THEY COULD DO SO. AND OF THE PEOPLE IN INDIO THREE HOURS AWAY IN MY DISTRICT ALSO AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT WOULD BE A LOCAL DECISION. IT IS FOR GONE TOO FAR OFTEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT OPERATES I THINK IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE BUT I GUESS. AB SIX TWENTY SIX WAS TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING SO A. B. THREE SEVENTY SEVEN WAS CREATED TO. CHANGE AB THREE SEVENTY SEVEN TAKES AWAY REAL LOCAL CONTROL BY REMOVING THE AUTONOMY. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA CITIES UNDER THIS BILL. IF RIVERSIDE COUNTY DECIDED TO PERMIT MH CASE THE AUTHORIZATION WOULD AUTOMATICALLY APPLY TO. ALL TWENTY EIGHT CITIES IN THE COUNTY AND THE UNINCORPORATED AREA. THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE COUNTY DECIDES. NOT TO PERMIT MH CASE NONE OF THE CITIES IN THE IN THE CORPORATE AREAS OF A LOT OF PERMIT THEM. AND VICE VERSA SO MUCH FOR. LOCAL CONTROL. EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN ALSO AMENDS THE DEFINITION OF INMATE CASE TO PROHIBIT THE PRODUCTION. MANUFACTURING PROCESSING FREEZING. OR PACKAGING OF MILK OR MILK PRODUCTS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO. CHEESE ICE CREAM YOGURT SOUR CREAM AND BUTTER. IT ALSO PLACES RESTRICTIONS ON WHO CAN DELIVER. HOME BAKED GOODS HOW THESE BUSINESS CAN PROMOTE THEIR PRODUCTS AND ADDS ADDITIONAL LABELING REQUIREMENTS. I'M NOT SURE GRAMOS TAMALES CAN SURVIVE ALL OF THIS. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THE FOOD CALIFORNIANS PURCHASE NO MATTER WHERE IT IS FROM A SAFE. AND THE FACILITIES WORD IS PRODUCE MEET THE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. BELIEVE ME THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES CAN CERTAINLY OVERSEE. THIS BABY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN IS JUST ANOTHER ATTEMPT. TO WRESTLE LOCAL CONTROL AWAY FROM CITIES IN OVER REGULATE A GROWING INDUSTRY WHOSE ROOTS ARE BASED IN HOME KITCHENS WE ALL GREW UP IN. LET'S GIVE THE SMALL ENTREPRENEURS IN OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES IN OPERON AN OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE. THESE REASONS IN HONOR OF LOCAL CONTROL THAT I'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED. PLEASE VOTE NO ONE EIGHTY THREE SEVEN SEVEN. THANK YOU CENTER STONE CENTER BOARD IS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION WITH THE FLOOR MANAGER OR ANYONE ELSE WHO COULD OFFER INSIGHT INTO THE CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN EVERY RESPECT OF COUNTY THAT WE HAVE IS ALREADY THE DULY AUTHORIZED ENTITY TO ISSUE THE FOOD PERMIT. SO IT UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN SIR GORGEOUS I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS TO BE A QUESTION SO CENTER HER TAUGHT ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE THE QUESTION. ALL RIGHT SHE SHE WELL IT NO. DID YOU. GET OUT ON MY OWN TIME THEN I'LL YES PUT THIS OUT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE COUNTY IS THE IS THE ENTITY THROUGH ITS HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SYSTEM THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ISSUING THE PERMIT. AND SO IF UNLESS I MISSED IT. EVERY COUNTY HAS TO GIVE THE GREEN LIGHT TO THE MOM AND POP OPERATIONS. SO IF THAT'S THE CASE IT STILL IS LOCAL CONTROL I FULLY SUPPORT THE WHOLE NOTION OF THRIVING HOME FOOD OPERATIONS AND SO I WOULD EXPECT TO SUPPORT THIS. KNOWING THAT THE COUNTY WOULD HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE HOUSE. SO I DON'T SEE WHERE THE CONTROVERSY IS ON THIS. THANK YOU SIR BARGES.

ALL RIGHT MR SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ONE TWENTY FOUR YES SIR. ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY ONE BY A SEMI MEMBER GONZALEZ AN ACT REALLY INTO EMPLOYMENT CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAN SOLACE TO PRESENT A B. FIFTY ONE. OUR LEGISLATURES PASSED SOME OF THE STRONGEST WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT PAY INEQUITY DISCRIMINATION AND AGREE JUST LABOR VIOLATIONS LIKE WAGE THEFT. HOWEVER THOSE LAWS ARE WORTHLESS IF THEY CANNOT BE ENFORCED IN COURT OR BY STATE AGENCIES BECAUSE AN EMPLOYER HAS FORCED THEIR WORKERS TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS IN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. MANDATING THAT EMPLOYEES GO TO ARBITRATION IS A PRACTICE WHICH ALLOWS COMPANIES TO FORCE EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS INTO SECRETIVE HEARINGS WITHOUT ANY COURT OVERSIGHT OR PUBLIC OVERSIGHT. WHICH HIDES LABOR VIOLATIONS FROM THE PUBLIC. PROTECTS OUR SERIAL OFFENDERS AND ULTIMATELY SILENCES VICTIMS. SINCE THE RISE OF THE ME TOO MOVEMENT WE'VE CONTINUED TO CITY WORKERS WHO'VE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION ON THE JOB. SPEAK OUT AGAINST US THIS FORCED OUR RATIONS. EXCUSE ME. FOR INSTANCE THROUGH COLLECTIVE ACTION WORKERS SHOULD GOOGLE EARLIER THIS YEAR WERE SUCCESSFUL IN ENSURING THE COMPANY ENDED ITS PRACTICE OF MANDATING ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS NOW WE KNOW ARBITRATION CAN BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TOOL WHEN BOTH PARTIES CHOOSING FREELY AND HAVE EQUAL BARGAINING POWER. IT IS FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL HOWEVER WHEN ONE PARTY'S ABILITY TO EARN A LIVING DEPENDS ON SIGNING AN AGREEMENT TO WAIVE THEIR STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT IS WHY AB FIFTY ONE IS A NARROWLY CRAFTED BILL TO SIMPLY REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE SITE TO SIGN SUCH AGREEMENTS WITHOUT THE THREAT OF JOB LOSS OR RETALIATION. THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS FROM USING THESE AGREEMENTS TO RESOLVE WORKPLACE THE DISPUTE BUT IT THE BILL EXPRESSLY STATES IT'S NOT INTENDED TO INVALIDATE EXIST ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS THAT ARE OTHERWISE ENFORCEABLE OR REPLY TO POSTS DISPUTE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WERE NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. TRUST. REQUIRED THAT THE EMPLOYEE HAVE A CHOICE WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL BECOME AN EMPLOYEE OF THAT COMPANY OR CONTINUE IS SUCH THAT IT IS NOT A FAIR AND EQUAL BARGAINING POSITION. AND THAT IS THE REASON THIS BILL IS BEFORE YOU WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKS IN ANY FURTHER DEBATER DISCUSSION SENATOR STONE. THE PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE I RISE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION AB FIFTY ONE FIRST OF ALL. THIS BILL VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS AS WELL AS THE U. S. SUPREME COURT. HAS ESTABLISHED THIS RULING THAT ALL STATES MUST FOLLOW FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT WHICH SIMPLY PUT. PROHIBITS ANY STATE STATUTE THAT SIX INTERFERE WITH LIMIT. OR DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ARBITRATION. THAT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR TO ME. IF WE PASS A B. FIFTY ONE IT WILL BE INEVITABLE THAT IT WILL FACE LITIGATION. IF YOU WANT TO PASS A POLICY LIKE THIS IT MUST HAPPEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THE MORE. THIS MEASURE COULD VERY WELL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO'D BE FORCED TO HIRE A TRIAL ATTORNEY. TO SETTLE THEIR DISPUTES. ANY POLICY THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYERS TO USE PRIVATE AND CONTRACTUAL ARBITRATION. CLEARLY IS NOT LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PICTURE. BY DOING THIS TRIAL LAWYERS WOULD INCREASE THEIR BUSINESS AND OFFICE AT THE EXPENSE OF LET IT. WHO WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE TIME IN THE PAST TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES. VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW IT WOULD BE A GRAVE DISADVANTAGE TO. LOW WAGE WORKERS THAT MANY OF YOU PROFESS TO WANT TO HELP I RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON THE B. FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU CENTER STONE SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I AM RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL THIS BILL NOT ONLY IS A ISSUE TO LIMIT. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST AN EMPLOYER FOR FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION BUT IT IS ALSO IS A BILL THAT WILL EXPAND PAGA THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO BUSINESS IN THIS STATE. SO MANY CASES IN THE STATE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND OF ACTUALLY BEEN FILED AGAINST EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE IN CAUSING AS TO BE NOT RATED NUMBER ONE IS THE LITIGATION HELL HOLE OF THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES I SO THIS BILL HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THAT AGAINST. JOB CREATORS IN THIS STATE WHERE THE EMPLOYEES ARE NOT THE WINNERS OF THESE ACTIONS DEBTOR FILED ITS JUST THE TRIAL LAWYERS THAT ARE THE WINNERS OF THESE ACTIONS THAT DEBT ACTUALLY GET LARGE. AMOUNTS OF SETTLEMENTS SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN A BILL WAS PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TO EXEMPT TO PEOPLE IN A CONTRACT LABOR AGREEMENT OR PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT BECAUSE CONTRACT LAW SUPERSEDES THE LABOR LAW AND EXEMPTED IT WHICH CREATES AN UNFAIR AND UNEQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. THIS BILL THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AGAINST TEMP YOURS IS JUST IN THE WAY. THAT I'M A FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION BE FILED IN THIS. TRYING TO PULL UP A WEBSITE WHERE. THEY'VE LISTED ALL THESE ATTORNEYS AND ALL THE CASES THEY HAVE A STATE OF CALIFORNIA MEAN ONE ATTORNEY HAS SEVEN THOUSAND CASES AGAINST EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CASE THERE'S NO WAY THEY HAVE THE PERSONNEL IN THAT IN THAT OFFICE TO REPRESENT. SEVEN THOUSAND PLAINTIFFS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR THE SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THE PENALTIES ARE SO HIGH AND THERE'S NO JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND AUTHORITY FOR THESE PENALTIES TO BE WAIVED OR REMOVED AND THE POTENTIAL THE PENALTIES ARE JUST ASTRONOMICAL AND THEY'RE REALLY NOT EVEN AFTER A- DISPUTED ISSUE LIKE WAGING OUR MEAL AND REST PERIOD WHETHERYOU SIGN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHERE YOU'RE ASKED THE DAY BEFORE THE DAY HAVE. ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEY'RE AFTER YOUR PAYCHECK STUBS WHERE THEY GET HUGE PENALTIES ON PERIODS COMMAS DASHES AND DATES I SEE MY COLLEAGUE ON THE THAT'S THE JOCKEY OF THIS BILL SHAKING HER HEAD BELIEVE ME I OPERATE IN THE BUSINESS WORLD IN THE REAL WORLD AND- OUR. THIRTY THREE THOUSAND PAGA CASES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE TRACK. THE DETRIMENTAL TO EMPLOYEES AT ONLY PASS THE- LINING OF. IS THAT PROCESS. THIS BILL IS THE SAME THING IT PRIVATE ACTION AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IT'S NOT ASKING AN EMPLOYEE TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS OR TO GET RID OF ANYTHING THEY STILL HAVE THE ODD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILE A LAWSUIT IF THEY ARE WRONG IN THE CASE OF AN EMPLOYER THAT IS DOING SOMETHING WRONG THESE EMPLOYEES STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILE THEY JUST CAN'T BUY A WITH A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH REALLY SHOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT'S A SEPARATION OF POWERS WHEN YOU HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND WHAT THIS PARTICULAR LOT DID SEVERAL YEARS AGO IS GO OUT DEPUTISE OFFSEASON QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO BE ATTORNEYS TO FILE LAWSUITS SO THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS P. SOLICIT LEGISLATION I WOULD ASK YOU JOB CREATORS NOT ANY SUCCEED. IN THIS. AND ASK FOR A NEW VOTE. YOU GROW UP TO SEE WHETHER MIKE SET A CENTER JACKSON YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AS A LAWYER. ONE WHO PRACTICED LAW FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. WHO HAS NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AS WE ALL SHOULD SINCE IT IS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT I FIND MYSELF SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED BY HEARING FROM THE EXPERTISE BY MY GOOD FRIEND FROM TO MACULA WHOSE PHARMACEUTICAL KNOWLEDGE I DO NOT QUESTION BUT WHOSE LEGAL SKILLS I WOULD QUESTION. BECAUSE AS A LAWYER. IS SOMEONE WHO HAS SPENT TWENTY TWO YEARS IN THE COURTROOM I HAVE GREATER CONFIDENCE IN OUR COURTS. ANY EXPERIENCE GOES WITH IT AS I THINK EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THIS HALL DOES WHO HAS PRACTICED LAW. YOU KNOW WE CALL TRIAL LAWYER LAWYERS THE BOOGIE MAN HERE BUT THE FACT IS THAT CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST THING HIGHEST BARS WHEN IT COMES TO FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS WE PROTECT AGAINST FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BETTER THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY. IF A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT IS FILED IT IS GOING TO BE THROWN OUT OF COURT. OUR JUDGES RECOGNIZE TRUTH FROM FICTION AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE TRUTH FROM FICTION WITH THIS BILL. BECAUSE WHAT IS THIS BILL DO. THIS BILL IS IN ABOUT A SEPARATION OF POWERS ANOTHER INTERESTING ISSUE THAT HAS NO NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS BILL. THIS BILL HAS TO DO WITH PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES. YOU KNOW WE SIT HERE AND WE MAKE ALL THESE LAWS THINGS TO PROTECT AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT THANKS TO PROTECT AGAINST WAGE THERE THANKS TO PROTECT AGAINST THE ABUSES THAT DO INDEED AND WE ALL KNOW EXIST. IN THE RELATIONSHIP SADLY BETWEEN WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS NOT EVERY WORKER NOT EVERY EMPLOYER BUT TO THE EXTENT WE KNOW THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT DO NOT DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WE HEAR SIT ON THIS FLOOR AND PASS LAWS. TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES. THIS IS A BILL THAT TALKS ABOUT KEEPING THAT PLAYING FIELD LEVEL FOR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IF THE EMPLOYEES ARE FORCED TO GO INTO ARBITRATION WE KNOW THAT THAT PROCESS IS SECRETIVE. WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT THE ARBITRATORS DO NOT HAVE TO ABIDE BY ANY LOSS OF EVIDENCE. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GIVE YOU A WRITTEN EXPLANATION AND THE ABILITY TO APPEAL IS ALMOST NON EXISTENT. AS SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO WORK FOR A COMPANY. YOU SHOULD BE HIRED ON THE BASIS OF YOUR QUALIFICATIONS AND NOT REJECTED BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WISH TO SIGN AWAY YOUR RIGHTS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IF WOULD BE CLEAR ON THAT AND NOT GOING THROUGH THAT OLD TIRESOME MEME ABOUT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND BLAH BLAH BLAH NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GO TO A LAWYER AND FRANKLY. YOU KNOW SOME OF US IN THIS ROOM ARE LAWYERS WE'RE NOT GONNA BITE ANYBODY'S HEAD OFF. WE LOOK AT OUR JOB IS PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO OTHERWISE. ARE NOT GOING TO BE PROTECTED BY IMPLEMENTING THE LAWS THAT WE STAND HERE ON THE FLOOR AND DO OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT WITHOUT A REMEDY. IS NO RIGHT AT ALL. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS GIVING PEOPLE THE CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO ENTER INTO ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS OR NOT. THIS IS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM. WELL I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS BILL WAS VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED. IT DOESN'T DEEM WAIVERS INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIONABLE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY OR UNENFORCEABLE AND IT MAKES NO ALTERATION TO THE EXISTING BURDEN OF PROOF. IN A DISPUTE OVER ENFORCEABILITY OF A WAIVER I COULD GO ON AND ON AND BORE THE HECK ARE YOU. TALKING ABOUT LEGAL ISSUES BUT NOT HERE MAKES ENOUGH MONEY PER HOUR TO GET INTO THAT ADULT. STUFF I SHOULD TO SAY IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION. YEAH RIGHT. IF THIS WERE A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE THEN THE ISSUE WILL BE RAISED IN COURT MY ASK OF YOU IS TO LOOK AT WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IT TRIES TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE A VOLUNTARY DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO ENTER INTO AN ARBITRATION PROCESS WHEN AND- IF. THEY HAVE A DISPUTE WITH THEIR EMPLOYER. WITH THAT I WOULD ACTUALLY ASKED FOR YOUR IPHONE. CENTER JACKSON ARE YOU DONE.

IN CURRENT LAW PROVIDES THESE EMPLOYEES WITH LIMITED OPTIONS TO SEEK FINANCIAL RELIEF A B. SIX SEVEN THREE WE'LL PROVIDE WORKERS A CLEAR PATH OF RECOURSE BY ALLOWING THEM TO SEEK LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER IN A HEARING BEFORE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER MANY CALIFORNIANS LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND DISTURBING EFFECTIVE INEXPEDIENT REMEDY. WHEN THEIR HARD EARNED PAY. WE'LL PROVIDE THAT RECOURSE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE. THANK YOU SIR MONEY ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY RISE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE MAJORITY LEADER ON THE FLOOR I HAVE A DEEP RESPECT FOR HIM BUT THE TALKING POINTS YOU PROVIDED ARE TOTALLY INACCURATE AND NOT TRUE. AND THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS A REMEDY UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING IN THE LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT BOARD FOR ANYONE TO FILE A LAWSUIT INCLUDING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO WHERE THEY CAN BE THEIR OWN ATTORNEY TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'RE EXPEDITIOUSLY IS HEARD IN THERE ARE PROBABLY TWENTY ATTORNEYS IN THE STATE WOULD TAKE THAT PRO BONO AND FILE A LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF THEM INCLUDING THE CONTRACTOR THE SUBCONTRACTOR THE PRIME CONTRACTOR AND EVERYBODY ELSE INVOLVED AND ENGAGED IN THAT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE A JOB. AND THERE IS ALREADY LIKE I SAID AT OF HUGE REMEDY OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO'S GOT THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE A JOB TO FILE ANY GRIEVANCE WHATSOEVER AT NO COST TO THEM. IS THAT A QUESTION. COME IN OKAY SIR HAVE A GREAT DAY. VICKI CENTER GROVE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING NONE CENTER. SENATOR OSEM SORRY. I DO WANT TO SPEAK FROM THE REAL WORLD OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE WORK AND MANY MANY INDUSTRIES WHERE. THOSE MEN AND WOMEN SIMPLY TRIED TO GET PAID. THE MINIMUM WAGE AND MAYBE SOME OVERTIME THERE ARE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND I MEAN THAT WITH THE BIG B. OF DOLLARS IN WAGE THEFT IN THE STATE BILLIONS THOSE MEN AND WOMEN NEVER RECOVER. THE MINIMUM WAGE THAT THEY HAVE COMING TO THEM WAGE THEFT IS A VERY MASSIVE PROBLEM IN THIS STATE IN MANY INDUSTRIES. WE WERE JUST ABLE. SENATOR MITCHELL THE NIGHT THROUGH THE BUDGET ABLE TO HELP. A SMALL GROUP OF GARMENT WORKERS WHO HAD NOT BEEN PAID AFTER THEY HAD GOTTEN THE DECISION IN THEIR FAVOR. WOULD NEVER PAID. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT SMALL COMPARED TO EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON IN THIS STATE EVERY SINGLE DAY ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO TO HELP THOSE MEN AND WOMEN RECOVER REMEMBER MINIMUM WAGE. AND MAY BE OVER TIME IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SO I STAND IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO SENATOR LLEVA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I TOO HAVE TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN THE REAL WORLD REPRESENTING WORKERS AND WHEN I WAS AN HOURLY WORKER MYSELF I USED TO SAY TO PEOPLE LOOK AT YOUR PAYSTUB BECAUSE BY ACCIDENT OR BY DESIGN MANY TIMES EMPLOYERS DO NOT PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES PROPERLY AND IF YOU DO NOT CALL THEM ON IT THOSE LOST WAGES ADD UP TO BEES BILLIONS WITH A CAPITAL B. AND IF YOU LOOK AT MOST PAY STUBS NOW. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SEEN IT CHANGE IT USED TO DEALING IN A WHAT YOU WERE BEING PAID FOR NOW IT'S JUST ONE WAGE AND IT MAKES IT MUCH HARDER FOR WORKERS TO DETERMINE IF THEY WERE PAID CORRECTLY SPECIALLY FOR HOURLY WORKERS ESPECIALLY FOR WORKERS WHO ARE PAID MINIMUM WAGE. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE PAID WHAT THEY'RE OWED IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO DO IT AND IF NOT US WHO AND IF NOT WHEN NOW. WHEN I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR LEVEL SEEING NO FURTHER MIKE'S NOTHER MIKE UP CENTER AROUND. THANK YOU. MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD JOB BY THE WAY. WE LIKE BRADFORD BETTER BUT HEY. ANYWAY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YEAH I'M OPPOSED TO THIS FIELD HI I GUESS ALL OF US HAS WORKED IN THE WORLD REAL WORLD BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS. THIS BODY SEEMS TO BEAT UP AND THINK EVERY EMPLOYER WANTS TO SCREW SOMEONE OVER I GOT A K. I AM I GET TIRED OF HEARING AT THE SAME OLD. SONG THAT YOU GUYS SAYING HERE ONE OF THE REASONS HE'S TRUCKERS ARE HAWKING OR HORNS OUT HERE IS BECAUSE THEY ARE HAPPY WITH THIS BODY. FOR THE LAWS THAT ARE BEING PASSED HERE YOU GUYS SEEM TO BE EMBRACING SOCIALISM AND GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO THINK THAT THEY CAN PUSH BUSINESSES AROUND AND THAT'S. REPORTS BY THE HOOVER INSTITUTE ANOTHER BAD BILL OF MANY IT'S WRONG AND I JUST WANT EXPRESS MY OPINIONS HERE. AND I'M GOING TO VOTE NO THANK YOU. VEGAS EMERIL CENTER BATES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT YES YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB AND I DO LIKE YOU HEAR MY SEAT MAXELL. ANYWAY ARM WHAT I'M HEARING FROM EMPLOYERS IN MY DISTRICT IS WHAT IS REALLY TROUBLING WHEN THEY MAKE AN HONEST MISTAKE AND I DON'T LIKE TO THINK THAT EVERY EMPLOYER ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH HERE IN CALIFORNIA SCREEN THEIR EMPLOYEES HANDED THEY'RE BEGINNING TO BE SO BURDENED BY THESE PAGO LAWSUITS AND THEY HAVE NO WAY OUT AND I'D LIKE TO QUOTE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA WHO SAID A RIGHT WITHOUT A REMEDY IS NO RIGHT AT ALL WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE NO RIGHT TO REMEDY. BEFORE THEY ARE HIT WITH THESE MASSIVE PAGO LOSSES SO I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE SEE MORE AND MORE OF THESE BILLS COMING FORWARD THAT PUT THE BALANCE IN THE HANDS OF THE EMPLOYEES AND I BELIEVE EMPLOYEES WANT THEIR MONEY ON TIME IF THEY COULD GO TO AN EMPLOYER IN THERE WITH A REMEDY THAT WAS VERY QUICK AND FAST ALL THOSE CORRECTIONS WILL BE MADE IMMEDIATELY BUT INSTEAD THE INTERFERENCE OF THE PAGO LAWSUITS GET IN THE WAY WITH BIG PROMISES YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECK BUT IF YOU WORK WITH ME YOU'LL GET FIFTEEN THOUSAND. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE AND WE CANNOT DENY THAT SO I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE ON THE US AND I'D LIKE US TO TAKE A REALLY LONG HARD LOOK AT THE THOUGH I CHARTERED THE AUTHORITIES THAT WE HAVE GIVEN TO PRAGUE AND MAYBE RETHINK THAT. THANK YOU I URGE NO VOTE. THANK YOU SIR BATES. SEEING NO OTHER MIKES UP. THEIR MONEY YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. WELL I WANT TO THANK ALL THE COLLEAGUES WHO ROSE TO ADDRESS THIS I DO WANT TO OFFER SOME CORRECTIONS. TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD SUGGESTING THAT. THIS ISN'T NECESSARY BECAUSE THE LAW ALREADY PROVIDES FOR IT ACTUALLY. TO MY FRIENDS IN THE MINORITY CAUCUS THIS PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE TO A PAGA PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO RECOVER UNPAID WAGES I WOULD ALSO SUBMIT. THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT AFFECT LAW ABIDING EMPLOYERS THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO GO AFTER AN EMPLOYER WHO DOESN'T PAY WAGES TO THEIR EMPLOYEE AND IT PROVIDES AN ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY SO THAT THE EMPLOYEE WOULD RECEIVE THE PENALTY THAT IS ALREADY IN LAW CURRENTLY ASSESSED BY THE STATE. THE PENALTY CURRENTLY GOES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT TO THE EMPLOYEE WHO IN MANY CASES HAS GONE WEEKS MONTHS OR MULTIPLE MONTHS WITHOUT GETTING THEIR LOW INCOME WAGES THAT ARE OWED TO THEM SO WHAT THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES IS GONNA REMOVE FEWER CASES FROM A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND A PAGA. REMEDY TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY AND INSTEAD OF THE PENALTY THAT IS ALREADY ASSESSED GOING TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS BILL DIRECTS THAT PENALTY THAT WORKER WHO DIDN'T GET PAID AFTER DUE PROCESS IS AFFORDED TO THE EMPLOYER TO MAKE THEIR CASE. IN OUR COMMISSIONER CAN DETERMINE. WHETHER OR NOT AND BOARD YES. IT PROVIDES FOR. THOSE REASONS I WOULD JOIN THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING OUT HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ENERGY HERE I VOTE.

THE STATE AUDITOR RECENTLY CONCLUDED THAT WATER BOARDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT BUT THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED ADEQUATE GUIDANCE FOR ASSESSING THE COST OF DOING SO. FOR THOSE REPRESENT CITIES YOU KNOW ALL THESE FINES COULD BE QUITE HEFTY.

ASSEMBLY BILL THREE SEVENTY EIGHT BY SOME REMEMBER THE MON AN ACT RELATING TO CHILDCARE CENTER MITCHELL THE FLOOR IS YOURS I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT A B. THREE SEVENTY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF SOME REMEMBER LEE MOANED AND THIS IS A PRIORITY BILL FOR THE- LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT CREATES A SUSTAINABLE CAREER PATHWAY AND SUPPORT. FOR THOSE TO EDUCATE AND CARE FOR OUR YOUNGEST CALIFORNIANS CALIFORNIA'S EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF WOMEN AND PREDOMINATELY WOMEN OF COLOR THIS IS THE WORK FORCE THAT OFTEN DOES NOT EARN A LIVABLE WAGE AND QUALIFIED FOR THE SAME SUBSIDIES USE. BY THE FAMILIES THEY SERVE. WE KNOW THAT WITH ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PARENTS ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE IN CHILDREN ARE. ARE SET UP TO SIX FEET. THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON CHILDCARE RECOMMENDS THE SUPPORT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS FOR FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME PROVIDERS BOTH LICENSED AND LICENSE EXAM ALSO COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. THIS BILL CREATES STABILITY FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BY MAKING QUALITY TRAINING AVAILABLE TO ALL PROVIDERS AS WELL AS ALLOWING THEM TO ENGAGE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. A B. THREE SEVENTY EIGHT PROVIDES A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS BOTH PROVIDER PAY INEQUITY AS WELL AS THE LACK OF A SET ACCESSIBLE CHILDCARE. AGAIN THE MEASURE IS A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AS WELL AS THE LATINO CAUCUS AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I VOTE. THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. CENTER JACKSON. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE YOU KNOW WE TALK WE TALK ABOUT TRYING TO GIVE THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO BE AT THE STARTING LINE IN THE IN THE RACE IN LIFE AT THE SAME PLACES ALL OTHER CHILDREN. AND THIS IS A BILL THAT. RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WHICH IS WHY TO LEGISLATE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY. AND I THINK IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS EARLY. SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN OUR SOCIETY THAT WE NOT ONLY FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS WHEN THEY BECOME. ADULTS OF WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OR WHAT HAVE YOU. WHETHER IT'S CHILDREN WHO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL OR WHO FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT WORK AS THEY AGE BECAUSE THEY REALLY HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE. IT REALLY STARTS EARLY AND THIS KIND OF A BILL PROVIDING THAT OUR YOUNGSTERS HAVE QUALITY CARE. THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PROVIDE THAT CARE ARE TRAINED TO UNDERSTAND THE FUTURE UNDERSTAND OUR CHILDREN UNDERSTAND DEVELOPMENT IN OUR YOUNGEST RESOURCE IF THIS IS THE PLACE WE SHOULD START AND THIS IS A BOTH A PREVENTION MEASURE THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT MEASURE THIS IS THE KIND OF BILL THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SO THAT WE CAN STOP PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY START ENCOURAGING THESE WONDERFUL LITTLE HUMAN BEINGS THAT ARE THE FUTURE OF OUR SOCIETY IN OUR WORLD THEY HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY POSSIBLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT IS GOING TO HELP US BOTH TAKE THE LEAD IN THIS NATION WIDE AND HELP OUR YOUNGSTERS BECOME THE BEST THAT THEY CAN BE AND WITH THAT I STRONGLY URGE AND I VOTED AND THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE FLOOR. MANAGER FOR BRINGING THIS MATTER FORWARD. THANK YOU SIR JACKSON SENATOR STONE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT WE ALWAYS WANT. WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BETTER EDUCATE OUR OUR CHILDREN BUT THIS BILL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN. A UNION GRAB THAT IT'S SUBSTANTIATED AND SUPPORTED. BY THE DIRECTION OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WHICH WILL BE MANDATED TO PROVIDE THE NAMES HOME ADDRESS MOBILE. PHONE NUMBERS EMAILS FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. WITHIN AN APPROPRIATE UNIT AND MANIPULABLE ELECTRONIC FORMAT ON A MONTHLY BASIS SO THAT UNION REPRESENTATIVES CAN GO OUT AND ORGANIZE SUCH GROUPS. WHY WE LIMIT IT TO UNIONS HAVING ACCESS TO THOSE THOSE NUMBERS AT THIS IS TRULY ABOUT BETTER EDUCATION WHAT GIVES THE UNIONS. THE MONOPOLY ON THE EXPERTISE TO BETTER EDUCATE OUR KIDS. YOU KNOW. IT'S VERY CLEAR. THAT THIS INSTITUTION IS STRONGLY CONTROLLED BY LABOR AND IT'S VERY CLEAR. THAT CERTAIN MEMBERS ARE OWNED BY LABOR UNIONS. ANNUAL AID BE EXEMPLIFIED TODAY WHEN YOU SEE WHO VOTES FOR THIS MEASURE WHO DOESN'T OFFER THIS MEASURE LET'S PLAY ON AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD THIS SLANTS AT ALWAYS TOWARD THE DIRECTION OF UNIONS WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS IN THE BEST INTEREST FORMULAS FOR THOSE REASON. REASONS I RECOMMEND OVER AN EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU CENTER STONE ANY FURTHER DEBATER DISCUSSION SEEING I MISTER. SENATOR MITCHELL PLEASE CLOSE. LET ME BEGIN MY CLOSE BY HELPING TO CLEAR FIVE FOR MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE FROM THE GREAT COUNTY OF ORANGE. THAT I AM OWNED BY NO ONE. WHATEVER COUNTIES FROM ED TO MACULA. HE YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT THOUGHT AS EVERYBODY ELSE WITHIN THE SOUND OF MY VOICE. I'M OWNED BY NO ONE. AND I HOPE THAT ALL OF US WOULD BE RESPONSIVE TO THE OVER FORTY THOUSAND FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE ALL OF US REPRESENT THEM. AND WHILE. IT APPARENTLY IS EASY AND CONVENIENT FOR MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE TO SIMPLIFY COMPLEX ISSUES BY SIMPLY SAYING IT'S A POWER GRAB BY LABOR AND THAT HIS COLLEAGUES TO THE LEFT OF HIM ARE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF SUCH LET'S HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. AND ALL THE WORKING PARENTS WITHIN THE SOUND OF MY VOICE RELY ON HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM IN PROVIDERS TO ALLOW THEM TO COME TO THIS PLACE OF WORK EVERY DAY. SHOULD UNDERSTAND I WOULD CHALLENGE ALL OF YOU. TO TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK A FAMILY DAYCARE PROVIDER EARNS HOURLY. DO YOU HAVE A CLUE. I BET YOU DON'T. THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BILL. IS TO. NOT CLASSIFY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS IS PUBLIC. PLEASE THEY'LL REMAIN SMALL BUSINESSES. IT IS TO CREATE AN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND THE STATE. NOW THEM. TO ENGAGE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND DISCUSSIONS AROUND THEIR REIMBURSEMENT. IT WILL NOT ALTER THE RIGHTS OF FAMILIES TO SELECT THE CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S BEST FOR THEM. GOVERNMENT GOT INVOLVED IN THE CHILDCARE SYSTEM WHEN WE ASK WORKING WOMEN BACK IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR TO GO TO WORK FOR THEIR COUNTRY. AND SOME WOMEN HAVE REMAINED IN THE WORK FORCE. AS YOU ALL WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE ABLE TO FEED CLOTHE AND HOUSE THEIR FAMILY. AND SOME FAMILIES JUST DON'T EARN ENOUGH. THAT'S WHERE GOVERNMENT STEPS IN WITH THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH COBB COUNTY'S OPERATES. THAT'S THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FAMILY DAY CARE PROVIDERS WHO PROVIDE CARE TO CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE SUBSIDIES EVERY DAY. AND THOSE WOMEN AND MEN SHOULDN'T BE ASKED TO DO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK IN OUR COLLECTIVE LIVES. FOR THE POVERTY WAGES THEY ARE CURRENTLY EARNING. WELL IM NOT. CHOOSING TO FLOOR JACKIE THIS BILL BECAUSE I'M OWNED BY LABOR. I'M CHOOSING TO FLOOR JACKIE THIS BILL TO HELP EDUCATE THOSE WHO NEED IT. ABOUT WHAT QUALITY CHILDCARE LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT QUALITY CHILDCARE RELIES UPON. QUALITY CHILDCARE RELIES UPON A TRAINED COMMITTED CHILDCARE PROVIDER. WHO IS CONSISTENT IN HIS OR HER CARE FOR CHILDREN. WHO WANT TO BE IN THIS SECTOR IN THIS BUSINESS AND CAN AFFORD TO BE SOMEONE TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AS AND AS AS SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE SYSTEM. QUALITY TRAINING AND CONSISTENCY. IS WHAT CONSTITUTES HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE. FOR THOSE REASONS COLLEAGUES I'D ASK THAT YOU RE EVALUATE YOUR ATTITUDE ABOUT THIS BILL AND SUPPORT A B.

SOME OCCUR RESOLUTION ONE TWENTY TWO BY A SEMI MEMBER GONZALEZ RELATIVE TO DIAPER NEED AWARENESS WEEK SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU SIR COLLEAGUES A C. R. ONE TWENTY TWO RECOGNIZES THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY THIRD THE TWENTY NINTH OF THIS YEAR AS DIAPER NEED AWARENESS WEEK. DIAPER NEED OCCURS WHEN THE FAMILY DOES NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF DIAPERS TO KEEP CHILDREN CLEAN DRY AND HEALTHY. ONE IN THREE FAMILIES EXPERIENCES A DIAPER NEED AT SOME POINT WHILE THEIR CHILDREN ARE LESS THAN THREE YEARS OF AGE AND NEARLY HALF OF ALL FAMILIES WILL DELAY CHANGING A DIAPER IN ORDER TO EXTEND THEIR SUPPLY. I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY OF YOU HERE REMEMBER WHAT YOU PAID FOR DIAPERS A MONTH. AW. IN THAT FOR MANY OF YOU IT WAS DECADES UPON DECADES AGO. SO LET ME JUST REMIND YOU. DIAPERS CAN COST UP TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CHILD OR MORE DEPENDING UPON WHERE A FAMILY IS ABLE TO PURCHASE THEM. DIAPER NEED ALSO CREATES A BARRIER WHEN PARENTS ARE GOING TO WORK BECAUSE CHILDCARE PROVIDERS REQUIRE FULL DAY SUPPLY OF DIAPERS FOR THE PAYMENT WHICH CAN BE UP TO TEN DIAPERS PER DAY. WHILE SOME FOOD BANKS IN CLINICS PROVIDE SMALL AMOUNTS OF DIAPERS WHEN THEY CAN THEY'RE DIFFICULT ITEM TO KEEP IN STOCK. A LESS ORGANIZATIONS ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE DIAPER BANK. DIAPER BANKS ARE CRITICAL FOR GETTING% THIS NECESSARY HEALTH SUPPLY IN THE HANDS OF FAMILIES DURING TIMES OF NEED. AGAIN COLLEAGUES THE WHOLE GOAL OF THE RESOLUTION IS TO RAISE AWARENESS. OF THE PROBLEM AND ENCOURAGE ALL CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT RGANIZATIONS LIKE DIAPERS THANKS TO HELP ALLEVIATE. THE DIAPER NEEDS I ASKED FOR AN I. BOAT. THANK YOU SIR MITCH.
