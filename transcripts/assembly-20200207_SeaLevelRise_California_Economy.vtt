00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:59.759
IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.794

SOME AGES TO BE THIS IS YOUR

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:44.416

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.653
THE FINAL CATEGORY. IS REALLY

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:55.153
FOCUSING ON THIS PUBLIC

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.423
AWARENESS ISSUE SO WE RECOMMEND

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.825
PUTTING IT SEC I'M- IT WILL

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:04.296

STATE ADOPT. REQUIRE FOR REAL

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.339
THE DISCLOSURES ARE ON FLOODING

FOR SEA LEVEL RISE COMPARABLE

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.708
TO WHAT WE HAVE FOR EARTHQUAKES

RESILIENCY. AND SOMETHING THAT

CONTEMPLATES THE MAGNITUDE OF

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:48.493
THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE. YOUR THE

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.895
FISCAL PURSE I WANTED TO JUST

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:51.496

EDUCATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:02.907
SOMETHING AT THE FIVE BILLION

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:04.442
DOLLAR LEVEL FOR SOMETHING THAT

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:06.444

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:09.013
TO A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.481
FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR-

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:10.982
CHALLENGE. IS THERE A IS THERE

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:12.584
BUDGET REASON WHY WE OUGHT TO

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.719
LIMIT OURSELVES- AT THIS TIME.

00:29:14.786 --> 00:29:16.788
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE BONDED

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:19.023
INDEBTEDNESS- STATUS OF OUR

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.126
BONDED INDEBTEDNESS NOW IN

00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:27.031
CALIFORNIA AND- SORT OF WHERE

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.867
WE ARE HISTORICALLY WITH REGARD

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:32.637
TO BONDED INDEBTEDNESS AND IS

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:33.171
THERE A CONCERN ABOUT THE

00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:34.739
BROADER ECONOMY WHERE A GROWTH

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:36.908
PERIOD THE RECESSION IS NOT

00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:38.776
UPON US YET BUT JUST SOME OF

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:39.410
THE THINGS THAT WE OUGHT TO BE

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:40.778
CONSIDERING ONE WERE ACTUALLY

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:44.582
CRAFTING A PROPOSAL THAT MIGHT

00:29:44.649 --> 00:29:46.518
GO BEFORE THE VOTERS. SURE

00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:48.720
YEAH. THERE'S NO RIGHT NUMBER

00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:50.555
FOR A BOND- AND WE WOULDN'T

00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:51.122
EVEN AS YOUR FISCAL VISORS

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:52.690
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU

00:29:52.757 --> 00:29:54.792
WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER IS BUT I

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:55.393
THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.594
TRADE OFF SOME OF THE

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.363
CONSIDERATIONS WE WOULD SUGGEST

00:29:58.429 --> 00:29:58.963
THINKING ABOUT OR WHAT DO YOU

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.798
ASSESSES THE NEED. RIGHT NOW

00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:02.567
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.702
BENEFIT OF BONDS AS IT PROVIDES

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:05.236
AN INFLUX OF FUNDING OF

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:08.373
IMMEDIATELY FOR NEAR TERM.

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:10.608
CAPITAL PROJECTS- TO TRADE OFF

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:11.209
WITH BOND IS THAT THEN YOU'RE

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:13.311
PAYING FOR IT FOR QUITE AWHILE

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:14.546
YOU KNOW FOR USUALLY THIRTY TO

00:30:14.612 --> 00:30:19.083
FORTY YEARS. AND I'M AND YOU'RE

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:19.651
PAYING MORE BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:20.685
PAYING INTEREST. AND THOSE OUT

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:24.789
YOUR COSTS ARE NON NEGOTIABLE

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:25.356
THEIR COMMITMENTS ITS FIRST

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:26.658
CALL AND THE GENERAL FUND EVERY

00:30:26.724 --> 00:30:28.793
YEAR- SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.662
SPENDING ABOUT SIX BILLION

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:31.196
DOLLARS A YEAR OUT OF THE

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:32.964
GENERAL FUND ON DEBT FOR

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:36.601
PREVIOUS. ONES ABOUT ONE IN

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:37.202
LITTLE OR ONE MILLION AND FOR

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:38.970
NOW RESOURCE RELATED BONDS

00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:40.772
HISTORICALLY THAT'S A PRETTY

00:30:40.838 --> 00:30:42.807
LOW PERCENTAGE OF GENERAL FUND

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:44.609
IT'S ABOUT 4% OF OUR ANNUAL

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:45.276
GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES RIGHT

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:52.483
NOW FOR BOND AT. THAT'S FOR.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.084
REASONS ONE IS WE HAVE A VERY

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:53.685
HEALTHY GENERAL RIGHT NOW HIS

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:54.919
STORE. SO FOR AS LOW BECAUSE

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.955
OUR IS ONE OF THOSE REASONS. SO

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.990
I THINK WE WOULD ADVISE WHEN

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:00.925
YOU THINK ABOUT BONDS IS NOT

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:02.627
FREE MANY- IT DOES HAVE KIND OF.

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:04.862
GENERATIONAL IMPACTS IN TERMS

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:06.965
OF PAYING IT OFF AS WELL AS-

00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:10.468
THE BENEFITS- SO YOU COULD ALSO

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:11.069
THINK ABOUT A COMBINATION OF

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:14.973
SOME BONDS- AMOUNT TO. THAT YOU

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:16.708
FOR ON WHICH YOU WILL HAVE TO

00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:17.308
PAY THAT DEBT BUT ALSO WE

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:18.843
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A HEALTHY

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:19.410
GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW YOU

00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:21.079
COULD ALSO THINK ABOUT SOME PAY

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:22.847
AS YOU GO. AND SOME. UP FRONT

00:31:22.914 --> 00:31:24.549
GENERAL FUND COSTS THAT. I'M

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:26.718
DEBT AND PERHAPS THE STATE IS

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:28.620
BETTER POSITION TO ALL FOR NOW.

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:30.688
IT DOESN'T COMMIT ADDITIONAL

00:31:30.755 --> 00:31:31.289
RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE WHEN

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:33.191
THE STATE MIGHT NOT BE AS ABLE

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:41.032
TO AFFORD AN. THANK YOU. THANK

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:43.234
YOU MADAM CHAIR OF. FRUIT AND

00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:45.169
FOR THE WORK OF THE LA WAS

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:46.771
OFTEN THE REPORT OF A YOUR

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:50.808
LYING IN THE SONG WHICH IS THAT

00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:52.744
AND WITH THE SIX IS IN THE

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:56.814
TWELVE DAYS SOME. KIND OF PHONE

00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:57.382
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT I MEAN

00:31:57.448 --> 00:31:58.716
THEY'RE SO MANY FOR. I GUESS

00:31:58.783 --> 00:31:59.350
THE QUESTION COMES TO MY FOR ME

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.185
IS WHERE DO WE BE. WHAT WOULD

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:03.021
BE. THE FIRST SECOND THIRD

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.856
THING TO ME A NUMBER OF THE

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:05.456
STATE AND PROBABLY THE MOST

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:08.626
OBVIOUS TO ME IS THE ONE THAT-

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.862
MACHINE. IS NOT A PRIORITY

00:32:10.928 --> 00:32:11.462
THOUGH IT'S THE EDUCATION AND

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.097
KIND OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:15.066
WITH THE TIRES LEADERSHIP- BUT-

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:16.901
WHERE WOULD IS THERE A BENEFIT

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:19.103
IN ORDER THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.072
YEAH I THINK WE WOULD SUGGEST

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:23.207
THAT PLANNING. YOU KNOW MANY

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.976
FOR PLANNING NEEDS TO COME

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:28.713
BEFORE PROJECTS AND- SO SOME OF

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.882
THAT PLANNING AND THEN SETTING

00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:31.416
UP SOME OF THESE REGIONAL

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:32.917
PARTNERSHIPS IS ALSO KIND OF A

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:35.119
FIRST LINE- ACTIVITY. COMMAND

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:38.890
PROVIDING SOME SOME PRETTY

00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:40.892
MODEST AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR.

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:43.528
FIRST OF STAFF IN CREATING

00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:44.595
REGIONAL CLUB AROUND THE STATE-

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:48.966
TO START THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:50.835
ONE OF THE POINTS WE TRY TO

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:52.503
MAKE IS WE NEED TO START DOING

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:53.104
SOME PROJECTS AND SOME PILOT

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:55.139
PROJECTS IN PARTICULAR TO LEARN

00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:58.776
BUT- WE DON'T WANT WE DON'T

00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:00.878
WANT TO INFUSE SO MUCH FUNDING

00:33:00.945 --> 00:33:02.714
IMMEDIATELY. IT'S KIND OF GOOD

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.281
PROJECTS ARE READY TO GO AND

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:05.116
THE PLANNING IS AN IN PLACE

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:06.818
BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO BE

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:08.953
STRATEGIC AND HAVE A

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.722
COORDINATED APPROACH AND WE

RESILIENCY PLAN EXPLORES.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:11.187
CONGESTION PRICING SO THINK

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:12.688
ABOUT AN ISLAND WE'VE ONLY GOT

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:13.322
FIVE OR SIX WAYS TO GET ON AND

OFF THE ISLAND AND WE'RE

01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:16.926
WILLING TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:17.560
CONGESTION PRICING IS A WAY TO

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:19.061
GET PEOPLE OUT OF AUTOMOBILES

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:21.163
AND INTO ALTERNATIVE. MODES OF

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.965
TRANSPORTATION THAT WHAT THIS

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:27.303
PLAN DID- WAS IDENTIFIED KEY

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:29.438
FLOODING LOCATIONS ACROSS OUR

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:31.307
CITY AND SO IF YOU TAKE THIS

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:34.877
MATTER THAT SHE DOESN'T DOESN'T

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:35.478
MOST HELLO THIS MAP RIGHT SO

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:39.048
LITTLE A LITTLE TIGHT- AWARE OF

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:40.883
OUR IT IS DOESN'T SCARE MOST

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.052
PEOPLE HOWEVER. OF THIS MAP

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:51.293
REPRESENTS- THREE IS A LOVER.

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.796
GET TECHNICALITY WORSE NOR THIS.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:59.301
OF AT. GIVES WE SEE HOW SINCE

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:01.203
IF. THE FLY AND I WANT TO ADD

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:09.211
OF THE TO PAY. OF CLYDE THESE.

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:13.382
HERE IS OF THE BASE TO CONNECT

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:17.319
OUT OKAY THE LEAST TO TAP ABOUT

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:17.953
FEET OUT AND VEHICLE GO THROUGH

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.923
THEM EVERY DAY. I'LL BE WE HAD

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.092
A LOT MEAL PLANS AND THAT SHE

DONE ARE TUBES AND OUR GOAL IS

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.296
TO BEAT AIM UP RELY TOOK ME OUT

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.398
HOW TO AT TO PLACE TO USE IT ME

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:31.400
ABOUT OR MINUTES SO IN FUTURE

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:33.402
AT FEET OF C. LOVER WITH COMMON

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:39.341
IN AND HERE WE DON'T. REYES I

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:39.975
THERE ARE TWO. IN THAT INSTANCE

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:43.379
NOW HERE'S- MORE THAN THAT IS

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:44.013
THAT NOT JUST A FEW THE REST IS

01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:47.116
A CURRENT DAY YOU'RE I MEAN IF.

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:49.485
FORM IS GET HAVE THE SAME RIGHT

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:53.088
OLD. IF THAT ON A FIFTY TERMS

01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:54.890
TOM WILL HAVE BOTH A OUR TO OF

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:57.359
FLOOD. THAT'S THE SAY THAT THIS

01:09:57.426 --> 01:09:59.128
IS NOT JEFF AND PROBLEM FOR THE

01:09:59.194 --> 01:09:59.762
FUTURE BUT IS H. TO FOR MY TO

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.297
DEAL WITH LEVEL RISE IN A FEW

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:02.898
WE STATE WE DEAL WITH THOSE CAR

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:05.000
FUNDING- RISKS AB TODAY- IN

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:07.303
ADDITION WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:07.903
THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF THE

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.405
CLIMATE PLAN IS THERE'S ANOTHER

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:11.073
RISK OUT THERE THAT WE DIDN'T

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.208
KNOW ABOUT BEFORE- THIS PROCESS

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:14.910
AND THAT IS THE RISE OF GROUND

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:15.544
WATER YOU'RE GONNA HEAR A BIT.

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:16.946
MORE ABOUT THIS LATER I

01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:18.881
BELIEVE- BUT ESSENTIALLY OF

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:19.448
SOME OF THE PREDICTIONS ARE

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:20.916
ACCURATE AROUND GROUND WATER

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:23.252
IT'S ALSO A MERGING IN THIS

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:25.254
SAME AREA OF BLUE- IN FUTURE

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:27.423
YEARS SAID THAT- THAT IS GOING

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:29.191
TO DEFINITELY BE A SIGNIFICANT

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:31.226
CHALLENGE FOR US SO NOW WE'RE

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:33.128
GONNA ZOOM BACK OUT- LOOK AT

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:33.729
OUR ISLAND THIS TIME GOING TO

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:35.864
FOCUS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE SO

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:37.266
IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.401
TO KNOW. THAT BUT IN ADDITION

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.270
YOU ON THE RIGHT HAND IS AN AIR

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.372
OF OURS THE CALL BACK ARM IT

JEEZ. OF THE- ARE A LITTLE. OR

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:53.382
OUT IT THE NEXT WHY'D YOU SEE.

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:53.983
MAY A POINT OF IN AND DAY FOR

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.250
ALL OF THAT BILL. IS A IN THE

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.353
CITY OF A AS A WRITER THAT

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:59.555
BIRTH BE ON THIS AND GET BUT

01:10:59.622 --> 01:11:01.223
IT'S NOT JUST THAT. THAT IT'S

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.225
IN ANOTHER CITY IT'S SO

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:05.361
CALTRAIN RIGHT AWAY SO YOU

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.763
HELP. TRANSPORTATION ALL IN

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.732
MAINE MEANS THAT- THE ROAD IT'S

01:11:09.798 --> 01:11:15.204
IN ANOTHER CITY YET ARE.

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.638
AFFECTING OF. PRETTY

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:17.072
SIGNIFICANT STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:21.110
LITTLE CITY- DE UM SO THIS IS

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:23.012
OBVIOUSLY A PROJECT THAT NEEDS

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:23.679
TO OCCUR IT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:25.280
INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:27.149
POTENTIALLY A REGIONAL

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:27.783
STRUCTURE COULD HELP OUT. IN

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.184
TERMS OF THE PRIOR TATIAN A

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.520
PRIVATIZATION OF A PROJECT LIKE

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:32.021
THIS NOW I DON'T WANT TO

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:35.157
OVERSELL THIS SO- FIXING THIS

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:37.459
LOCATION TERMS OF RAISING. A

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:39.328
ROAD THAT DOES NEED TO BE DONE

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:41.263
IT DOESN'T SOLVE ALL THE I'M TO

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:45.200
WORKING BY THIS HE- A TWO. SOME

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:49.538
OF THE OTHER A AREAS SLASH HE'S

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:50.172
SO IF YOU GO AROUND THAT AREA

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.740
BAY THERE'S A LITTLE AND THAT'S

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:55.544
WHERE THERE'S A COURT SEE ALL.

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:57.413
THERE'S A PRETTY DOPE AND AT A

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:57.980
BUT IS HE WORKED TREAT FROM

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:01.750
THAT'S ALL IT IS A FAIL AND I'M-

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:03.986
PRO. SIDE OF THE HILL WE'RE

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:07.056
GONNA ESSENTIALLY. PORTION OF

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:11.093
YOUR TO PAY. AND THAT A COME UP

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:11.694
THE HILL CREDIBLE LET OF SOME

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.295
KIND OF AN STRUCK TO PUT US

01:12:13.362 --> 01:12:15.497
FROM THAT A RISK IF YOU TO SEE

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:17.166
LIVE AT SEA LEVEL RISE AND A

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:17.700
ONCE IN FIFTY YEAR STORM

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:21.036
TOMORROW NOW NOT ONLY THAT. OF

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:21.603
WERE NOT USING RICHARD EIGHT

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:24.973
WE'VE INVESTED ABOUT SIX

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:25.541
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:27.176
MONEY IN THIS PROBABLY THREE TO

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:29.144
FOUR MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT IS

01:12:29.211 --> 01:12:29.812
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WILL KNOW

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.580
HOW IMPORTANT BOTH AT THE STATE

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:33.382
AND THE LOCAL LEVEL THOSE

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:33.982
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS IN OUR

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:35.584
CITY COUNCIL HAS STEPPED UP AND

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:37.219
SAID THIS IS A WORTHWHILE

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.188
PROJECT AND OBVIOUSLY WE NEED

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:39.788
SUPPORT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.256
RAISE- THE ADDITIONAL UP

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:43.559
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NECESSARY

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.694
FOR THAT PROJECT. I'M MOVING ON

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:47.763
TO THE NEXT SLIDE LET'S KEEP ON

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.631
THE ISSUE OF FUNDING. I WOULD

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:53.335
WANT TO HAVE JUST. A GIPSON

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.104
ROBBERY RATES. FORMER MRS. OUT

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.239
A VOTE TO HAVE. HAVE A HE

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:59.708
DIDN'T OWN TACK DOLLARS TO

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.176
INVEST IN THESE PROJECTS WE

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:03.412
RECENTLY HAD A- WATER QUALITY

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:05.581
IN FLOOD PROTECTION INITIATIVE

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:07.216
THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY 57% OF

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:09.418
VOTERS A PORTION OF THAT MONEY

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:11.453
IS GOING TO THESE KINDS OF

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.322
FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECTS. ARE

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:15.190
CITIES ABOUT TO HAVE A

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:15.657
CONVERSATION ABOUT AN

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.025
INFRASTRUCTURE BOND THAT MIGHT

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:19.194
BE ANOTHER WAY- TO FIND-

CAN LOOK AT DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:13.722
THAT WILL WORK FOR BOTH OF FOR

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:14.289
ALL OF OUR AGENCIES FOR THE

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:17.992
CITIES. AND FOR SFO. AND THE

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:21.930
FUNDING OVER. THE FUND FOR THE

01:23:21.996 --> 01:23:22.564
AIRPORTS PROGRAM COMES FROM THE

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.199
PARK REVENUE BONDS IS WHAT

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:25.934
WE'RE PLANNING FOR NOW BUT

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.002
FUNDING WOULD ALWAYS BE- HERE

01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:30.238
WE WILL LOOK FOR OTHER

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:31.906
OPPORTUNITIES. AS WE GET TO THE

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:32.507
POINT WHERE WE'RE IMPLEMENTING

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:36.077
CONSTRUCTION. NOW IT'S STILL

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:37.879
YOU KNOW PLANNING AND- GETTING

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:41.783
READY FOR SCHOOL SUBMISSION.

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.552
JUST QUESTION WHICH WHICH I

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:45.186
DON'T KNOW COULD BE A KEEPER OR

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:48.022
WITH DOCTOR HILL NECKS AND

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:48.623
SHE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT. BUT

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.125
IN CIVIL RIGHTS BUT WHERE WE

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:52.060
ARE RIGHT HERE. FOSTER CITY THE

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:54.028
FACT THAT IT'S BUILT ON PHIL

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:54.529
AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:58.333
PUTTING UP SOME LEVEES. AROUND

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.368
JUST TO A QUESTION ABOUT

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:04.105
GEOLOGY AND AM HYDROLOGY. WITH

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:06.141
LEVEES LEVEES OBVIOUSLY WOULD

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:08.376
SUPPORT SOME SEA LEVEL RISE AND

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:11.946
STORM. BUT I ALSO ASSUME THAT

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:12.547
THAT THE HYDROLOGY SHOWS THAT

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:14.215
THE GROUND WATER IS GOING TO

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:16.351
STILL NOT BE AS MUCH OF AN

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:18.486
ISSUE AS THOSE LEVEES GET OLD

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.255
OR WHAT ARE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK

01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:22.023
LIKE WARS THAT'S A MAN DOCTOR

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.925
HILLS GOING TO BE. ABLE TO

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:26.194
ADDRESS BUT I THINK PUBLIC

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.163
WORKS FOR. HERE I'M I'M IN. I

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:29.898
KNOW YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:32.300
BUT- HOLY COW. IF YOU'RE WRONG.

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:34.202
YOU COULD SORT FLOOD FROM THE

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:36.337
INSIDE BECAUSE AROUND WHAT WE

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:36.838
DO HELP HAVE A SHALLOW

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:39.774
GROUNDWATER TABLE. FORTUNATELY

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:40.375
WE ALSO HAVE A LAGOON SYSTEM

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:42.076
THAT NOT ONLY SERVES AS AN

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:44.312
ENTITY BUT FOR STORM WATER

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:45.880
DETENTION. SO WE'RE ABLE TO

01:24:45.947 --> 01:24:48.016
CONTROL THE- THE LAGOON SO ANY

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:48.683
WATER THAT COMES INTO OUR STORM

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.418
GREEN SYSTEM ENTERS THE GOON.

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:52.253
AND THEN AT OUR CORPORATION YOU

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.222
ARE WE HAVE A PUMP SYSTEM THAT

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.057
CAN DISCHARGE. THAT GROUNDWATER

01:24:56.124 --> 01:25:00.028
SOARING TIRE LAGOON SYSTEM. IS

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:00.562
SIX HUNDRED AND SOMETHING

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:03.832
ACRES. AND HAS THE CUP SIX FEET

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:05.767
DEEP. AND IT HAS THE CAPACITY

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:06.267
TO HOLD WATER AND THEN

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:08.269
DISCHARGED SO WE DO NEED TO

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.004
RAISE THE LEVY TO KEEP ALL THE

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:11.940
OUTSIDE WATERS FROM COMING IN.

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:12.474
AND THEN WE HAVE THE LOGIN

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.476
SYSTEM THAT HELPS US PUMP NOW.

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:16.377
OKAY THANK YOU THIS IS THE

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:18.513

THE GROUND WATER WOULD BE THE

02:03:01.006 --> 02:03:02.775

COMMUNITIES IN THE PUBLIC AS TO

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:12.418
BE WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND
