01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:13.015
FOCUSED ON ALLOWING CITIES TO

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:18.921
MUCH CONVERSION GOING ON

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:20.990
BECAUSE OF THE DOWN. TURN IN

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:22.325
THE ECONOMY AND SOME OF THE

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.460

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.585
IMPORTANT IF WE ARE TRYING TO

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:53.756

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:37.560
PARTICULAR. I I'VE TRIED TO BE

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.528
CLEAR HI IT WAS IN THE

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:42.598
PREVIOUS- BILL. SB ELEVEN

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.133
TWENTY WE HAVE RE CLARIFIED IT

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.035
WITH AN AMENDMENT IN THIS BILL.

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:48.371
WHICH SAYS FOUR UNITS. FOUR

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:51.474
UNITS AT. A PARCEL SPLIT. A

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.477
DUPLEX AND END THE SPLIT. TWO

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:58.247
UNITS ON THE OTHER SPLIT. SO

01:06:58.314 --> 01:06:59.815
FOR WE HAVE CLARIFIED THAT

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:02.451
FURTHER- IN TERMS OF PARKING AS

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:04.153
SOMEONE WHO ALSO COMES OUT OF

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.788
LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SPENT.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:08.591
WAY HE- MANY MANY HOURS AT

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:09.759
COMMUNITY PLANNING COMMITTEES

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:11.761
AND PLANNING COMMISSIONS AND AS

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:14.263
A COUNCIL MEMBER- I UNDERSTAND

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.831
THE ISSUE OF PARKING WE HAVE WE

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:18.067
HAVE CERTAINLY WORKED. OUT TO

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.935
CREATE A BALANCE THERE IS ONE A

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:22.138
PARKING UNIT R. ONE PARKING

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.039
SPACE PER UNIT. SO IF YOU'RE

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:27.376
TALKING FOUR UNITS- A DUPLEX

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:29.078
THAT YOU KNOW FOUR UNITS TOTAL

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:30.980
YOU'VE GOT FOR PARKING SPACES.

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:32.448
UNLESS YOU ARE NEAR HIGH

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:35.651
TRANSIT AREAS IN WHICH- YOU CAN

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:39.655
GET- OUT LESS PARKING BECAUSE

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:42.291
OF THE PROXIMITY. OF TRANSIT-

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:44.527
SO THIS- PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:46.429
REALLY FOCUSES ON URBANIZED

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:50.433
AREAS TO CREATE- DENSITY TO

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:51.200
ADDRESS THE HOUSING PRODUCTION

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:53.869
ISSUE- YOU MENTIONED FIRE

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:55.871
ACCESS I WOULD SAY. I JUST

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:57.239
WANNA POINT OUT THE OTHER ISSUE

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:58.407
WHICH IS OUTLINED NOT ONLY IN

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.075
THE BILL BUT OF COURSE IN THE

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:02.778
IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. IS

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:06.749
HIGH FIRE ZONES- SO THOSE ARE

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:07.850
DID THE DEVELOPMENT IS

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.919
PROHIBITED PROHIBITED AND HI

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:11.353
FIRESTONE'S UNLESS A LOCAL

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.556
JURISDICTION WAYS AND- SO THIS

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:15.090
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:17.626
INTENDED. TO BE A PARTNER

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:21.897
COLLABORATIVE WITH. LOCAL

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:22.498
GOVERNMENT AND TO STRIKE THAT

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:23.132
BALANCE SO WE CONTINUE TO LOOK

01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:24.867
AT ISSUES- ANY PIECE OF

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.869
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. IS GOING

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:29.138
TO CONTINUE TO BE- A

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.606
CONVERSATION WITH ALL THE

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:32.208
STAKEHOLDERS I APPRECIATE

AND IN OPPOSITION. AND WILL

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.913
CONTINUE TO WORK- AS WE DID

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:40.115
LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR- AS

01:08:40.182 --> 01:08:41.984
THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD SO I DO

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.887
APPRECIATE. THE CONTEXT AND THE

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:46.088
EXPERIENCE FROM WHICH HE

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:48.724
QUESTIONS COM. I THINK AND HOPE

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.926
I ADDRESSED BY AS MUCH OF THAT

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:53.963
AS I COULD. THANK YOU I CENTERS

01:08:54.029 --> 01:09:01.670
SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:04.974
I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR PRO

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.143
TEM ATKINS FOR HER WORK ON THIS

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:10.279
BILL HER WILLINGNESS TO WORK

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.580
WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND MAKE THE

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:13.415
ADJUSTMENTS THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:15.217
SHE HAS MADE IT NOT ONLY. LAST

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:19.088
YEAR- BUT AGAIN NOW THAT IT'S

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.290
COME BEFORE US THE ADDITIONAL

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:23.626
AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN.

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.661
AND THAT SHE USED FOR HER

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:27.296
WILLINGNESS TO BRING IT BACK TO

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.465
US TO ME THIS IS VERY VERY

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:31.967
IMPORTANT POLICY. AND I

01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:33.469
APPRECIATE THE HOUSING

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:35.571
COMMITTEES ANALYSIS WHICH GAVE

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.406
I THINK SOME OF THE REALLY

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:40.476
SALIENT POINTS- FOR EXAMPLE

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:43.712
INDICATING THAT. WE HAVE THE

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:49.785
CAPACITY TO ADD. UP TO EIGHT

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.253
HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW UNITS JUST

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:54.857
BY NEW HOUSING UNITS JUST BY.

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:57.259
ALLOWING ADDITIONAL UNITS ON

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:59.495
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND NOW

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:01.363
DESTINATION IS NOT BASED ON

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.098
PUTTING IN YOU KNOW BIG

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:05.034
APARTMENT COMPLEXES AT ON THE

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.769
LOTS OF MULTI FAMILY HOMES BUT

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:10.039
RATHER FOR THE TYPE OF VERY

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.541
MODERATELY DENSE HOUSING THAT

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:14.510
THIS BILL IS RECOMMENDING. WE

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:17.046
KNOW THAT WE ARE TWO POINT FIVE

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:19.582
MILLION UNITS AT MINIMUM SHORT

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.383
IN CALIFORNIA MEETINGS THAT WE

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.252
HAVE THAT'S HOW MANY UNITS WE

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:26.055
NEED TO NOT BE IN THIS HOUSING

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:29.024
CRISIS- THE OTHER THING THAT

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:31.026
THE ANALYSIS POINTED OUT IS

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:32.628
THAT MORE MODERATELY DENSE

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:35.464
HOUSING OF THE TYPE THAT WOULD

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:38.467
BE PUT FORWARD IN THIS BILL WAS

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:40.736
THE NORM IT WAS THE NORM THAT

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:42.471
WAS OUR NORMAL HOUSING PATTERN

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.740
UP UNTIL THE FIFTIES AND

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:47.610
SIXTIES IT BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:48.711
THEN IN THE SEVENTIES TO THE

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.646
POINT. WHERE SINCE THE

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:53.382
SEVENTIES WE HAVE DONE VERY

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:55.618
LITTLE. CONSTRUCTION OF THIS

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:58.754
SORT. AND IT IS PARTLY THOSE

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:02.157
FOR DECADES. THAT ARE WHY WE'RE

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:02.725
IN THIS CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:05.761
TODAY. NOW ADDITIONALLY I THINK

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:07.329
MOST OF US UNDERSTAND MUCH

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:11.467
BETTER. WHY WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:13.702
OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND HOW

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.372
ITS ORIGINS REALLY NOT

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:16.939
SOMETHING WE CAN GREATLY BE

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:20.409
PROUD OF AND I SEE THAT AS THE

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:21.443
REPRESENTATIVE BERKELEY MY

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:24.013
HOMETOWN. WHERE WE WERE THE

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:26.448
FIRST CITY TO REVIEW OR THE

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:28.484
VERY VERY FIRST CITY IN THE

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.686
EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS TO

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:32.588
DEVELOP THIS CONCEPT OF SINGLE

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:35.557
FAMILY ZONING AND ARE PLANNING

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:37.259
DOCUMENTS ARE CITY'S OWN

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:39.261
DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT IT WAS

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:42.131
EXPLICITLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:45.100
RACIAL EXCLUSION. SO WHILE IT

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.669
MAY NO LONGER BE THAT

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:49.638
INTENTIONAL. IT IS STILL THE

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:52.074
RESULT AND WHEN WE LOOK AT MAPS

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.376
ARE SINGLE FAMILY ZONES NOW

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:57.046
EQUAL THE SAME. DATE IN TERMS

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.847
OFDEMOGRAPHICS LOOK JUST LIKE

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:01.083
IF WE PUT A REDLINING MAP SO

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.252
THIS IS ONE WAY TO CORRECT THAT

01:12:03.318 --> 01:12:05.487
IT MAY NOT BUT AT LEAST IT

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:06.855
WOULD ADDRESS OUR HOUSING

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.991
SHORTAGE. ADDITIONAL THING IT

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:10.159
WOULD DO IS THAT WE'RE RIGHT

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:13.562
NOW AT THE LOWER LOWEST RATE

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:15.764
OWNER OCCUPIED HOME OWNERSHIP

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.700
CALIFORNIA'S AT SLOWEST RATE

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:19.835
SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.737
OF COURSE OUR HOMEOWNERSHIP WAS

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:24.106
GREATLY REDUCED DURING THE

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.008
GREAT RECESSION. AND IT IS VERY

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.944
POSSIBLE THAT IN THE SEARCH IN.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.547
SUCH CONSTRUCTION LIKE THIS

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.716
BILL WOULD ALLOW THE UNITS

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:35.651
WOULD BE MORE AFFORDABLE. THAN

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:39.855
BRAND NEW UNITS IN BRAND NEW-

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:42.091
DEVELOPMENTS EXTERNAL TO AN

01:12:42.157 --> 01:12:44.359
URBAN AREA THAT NEED WHERE YOU

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:46.428
NEED TO BUILD IN THE COST OF

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:47.629
ALL NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.198
LARGE THERE WOULD MOST LIKELY

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:50.733
BE FAR LARGER SQUARE FOOTAGE

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.701
INSECTS. SO IT'S VERY POSSIBLE

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:54.269
THAT THIS COULD ALSO EXPAND

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:56.271
HOME OWNERSHIP BECAUSE THESE

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:59.141
UNITS MAY BE. AT A LOWER PRICE

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.276
POINT PER SQUARE FOOT THAN SOME

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:05.881
OTHER UNITS- I THINK THE LAST

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:09.351
THING I WANTED TO RACE IS THE-

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:10.786
THEY'RE BOTH SOME OF THE

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:12.454
SPEAKERS WHO CALLED BUT ALSO

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:13.822
THE ANALYSIS AND THE

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.591
ENVIRONMENTAL. QUALITY

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:18.794
COMMITTEES- RESPONSE AROUND THE

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:21.830
SEAPORT ISSUE. AND I GIVEN THE

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:24.333
MODEST NATURE OF WHAT THIS IS

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:27.603
WHAT THIS BILL IS PROPOSING. I

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:29.705
THINK THE MUCH MORE GREATER.

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.106
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE THAT WE

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:32.341
HAVE TO WAY ARE THE

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:34.743
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS ARE

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.446
REFUSAL TO BUILD HOUSING IN ALL

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:39.882
THESE YEARS ESPECIALLY OUR

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:42.518
REFUSAL TO BUILD MORE HOUSING.

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.987
IN THOSE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:46.855
THAT ARE THE CLOSEST TO THAT

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.791
ARE THE JOB CENTERS THE HELP

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.259
DESK SERVICES THE

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:52.194
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SCHOOLS AND

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.063
AS A RESULT BECAUSE WE'VE NOT

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:57.232
ALLOWED. THE PROPRIOCEPTION OF

01:13:57.299 --> 01:13:58.934
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:00.502
HOUSING NOW IS FURTHER AND

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:02.871
FURTHER AWAY FROM JOB CENTERS

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.506
WE'VE SEEN ANY CREDIBLE

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:05.974
INCREASE IN THE GREENHOUSE

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:08.043
GASES FROM TRANSPORTATION AND

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.279
EVEN WITH OUR COMMITMENT TO

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:11.446
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IT'S

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:12.247
GOING TO BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.183
ACHIEVE THAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.251
FARMLAND AND HABITAT HABITAT

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:18.253
LAST. IN A VARIETY OF OTHER

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.688
THINGS THAT ARE FAR GREATER

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:21.557
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BEEN

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.992
ADDING A MODEST NUMBER OF UNITS

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:26.595
TO EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS- SO

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.831
AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE PRO

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.833
TEM FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. AND

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:33.068
I WOULD NOTE THE ANALYSIS SHOWS

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.970
THAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF-

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.438
COMMUNITIES MOSTLY IT

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:38.240
REFERENCES MINNEAPOLIS BUT WE

PROJECT DEVELOPERS TO TURN ON

01:57:49.862 --> 01:57:51.931

TRANSITION HOTELS AND MOTELS.

ON GREENFIELD THIS IS ALWAYS A

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:18.624
GOOD IDEA TO BUILD IN CITIES

01:58:18.691 --> 01:58:20.359

EVERYBODY IS OFTEN A CONCERN.

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:37.443
THIS EXPEDITED PROCESS WILL NOT

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:38.611
ONLY CREATES MORE MARKET RATE

01:58:38.678 --> 01:58:40.980
HOUSING. BUT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN

EXPEDITED MINISTERIAL PROCESS.

01:58:42.815 --> 01:58:44.550
WOULD MAKE PRIVATE PROJECTS

01:58:44.617 --> 01:58:45.518
PART OF THE SOLUTION TO

01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:47.687
INCREASING MORE AFFORDABLE

GOVERNMENT WITH THE GREATER

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:04.337
AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENT.

01:59:04.403 --> 01:59:06.172

THAT IS TO ACQUIRE THE MONEY TO

LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHEN I WAS IN

02:14:01.867 --> 02:14:02.667

AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND.

02:14:13.845 --> 02:14:14.880
THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TAKE A

02:14:14.946 --> 02:14:16.114

02:14:59.591 --> 02:15:02.794
WE- THERE ARE A LOT OF MOTELS

02:15:02.861 --> 02:15:03.695

02:15:03.762 --> 02:15:07.432
HOUSING- I AM SENSITIVE TO THE

02:15:07.499 --> 02:15:09.734
ARMED OPPOSITION OUR ARGUMENTS

02:15:09.801 --> 02:15:12.537

02:15:13.405 --> 02:15:15.974
CURRENTLY- GENDER FINANCES

02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:19.077
THINK ABOUT IS- INACCURATE-

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:22.514
HOWEVER. WE DID CREATE A RIGHT

02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:24.616

BECAUSE IT'S TO SIT THERE FOR

02:15:48.473 --> 02:15:50.208

THOUGHT TO HELP MAYBE THAT

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:20.739
COULD BE STRENGTHENED BECAUSE

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:21.773
WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IS

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.742

THAT THIS IS ANOTHER OVERSIGHT

02:31:54.472 --> 02:31:56.674
AT HAND WITH HOUSING IT'S MY

02:31:56.740 --> 02:31:58.175
UNDERSTANDING IN ONE OF OUR

02:31:58.242 --> 02:32:00.444
VERY FIRST COMMITTEE AT ON

HEARINGS ON I BELIEVE IT WAS

02:32:02.913 --> 02:32:05.249
HOMELESSNESS OR HOUSING I THINK

02:32:05.316 --> 02:32:06.984
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HOMELESS AS

02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:09.487
THEY DISCUSS THE AND WIDE ARRAY

02:32:09.553 --> 02:32:12.523

02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:14.291
WITH AT. THE HOUSING AND

02:32:14.358 --> 02:32:19.530
HOMELESSNESS. AND- THE LACK CAN.

02:32:19.597 --> 02:32:20.631
THAT NOT EVERYBODY KNOWING

02:32:20.698 --> 02:32:22.600
EXACTLY WHAT EVERYBODY'S DOING

02:32:22.666 --> 02:32:24.902
SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:26.303
TO WHY DID YOU FEEL COMPELLED

02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:28.072

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:34.778
AGENCY TO OVERSEE- THIS ISSUE-

02:32:34.845 --> 02:32:38.215
DO YOU BECAUSE I THINK- SENATOR

02:32:38.282 --> 02:32:38.983
YOU ALMOST ANSWERED THE

02:32:39.049 --> 02:32:40.718
QUESTION WITH A QUESTION. THE

02:32:40.784 --> 02:32:42.419
REALITY IS THAT NOT EVERYONE

02:32:42.486 --> 02:32:43.988
KNOWS WHAT EVERYONE IS DOING WE

02:32:44.054 --> 02:32:46.290
IN L. A. COUNTY WE HAVE EIGHTY

02:32:46.357 --> 02:32:48.392
EIGHT CITIES WE ALSO HAVE THE

02:32:48.459 --> 02:32:50.394
LARGE A CITY THAT IS LOS

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:52.329
ANGELES AND WE HAVE THE COUNTY.

02:32:52.396 --> 02:32:54.798
AND TO BE QUITE HONEST EVERYONE

02:32:54.865 --> 02:32:57.134
IS DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT-

02:32:57.201 --> 02:32:59.303
YOU KNOW WE HAVE- OR A LAKE

02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:00.437
CITY WE HAVE LOST SO WHICH

02:33:00.504 --> 02:33:02.640
FOCUSES ON HOMELESSNESS BUT IT

02:33:02.706 --> 02:33:04.742
DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

02:33:04.808 --> 02:33:05.776
DO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT

02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:07.311
THIS HOUSING AUTHORITY. THAT

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:09.313
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO AND SO THIS

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:10.848
ISN'T CREATING ANY OTHER FORM

02:33:10.915 --> 02:33:11.949
OF GOVERNMENT BUT IT IS

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:13.317
CREATING AN AGENCY TO HELP

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:15.085
COORDINATE THE DESPERATE

02:33:15.152 --> 02:33:16.587
EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON IN

02:33:16.654 --> 02:33:18.589
OUR COUNTY. AS IT RELATES TO

02:33:18.656 --> 02:33:20.024

PRODUCTION HOUSING PRESERVATION

02:33:22.993 --> 02:33:26.864
AND SUPPORTING RENTERS- WE NEED

02:33:26.931 --> 02:33:30.267
AN ENTITY THAT CAN CONVENE- ALL

02:33:30.334 --> 02:33:32.336
OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. WE NEED AN

02:33:32.403 --> 02:33:34.371
ENTITY THAT CAN STREAMLINE ALL

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:35.406
OF THE PROCESSES THAT ARE IN

02:33:35.472 --> 02:33:38.075
PLACE- AND WE NEED TO BE MORE

02:33:38.142 --> 02:33:39.977
TETHERED TO ONE ANOTHER AS IT

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:41.045
RELATES TO FINDING THE

02:33:41.111 --> 02:33:43.380
SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN HAVING

02:33:43.447 --> 02:33:44.982
EIGHTY EIGHT DIFFERENT-

02:33:45.049 --> 02:33:46.784

HOUSING CRISIS SO. THIS IS AN

02:33:51.155 --> 02:33:53.324
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE- THAT

02:33:53.390 --> 02:33:55.259
KIND OF TETHERING AND MORE

02:33:55.326 --> 02:33:56.760
COORDINATED AND STREAMLINING

02:33:56.827 --> 02:33:58.696
APPROACH SO IF I UNDERSTAND

02:33:58.762 --> 02:34:00.864
CORRECTLY YOU'RE SAYING IS THIS

02:34:00.931 --> 02:34:02.833
IS THIS WOULD BE THE OVERSIGHT.

02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:04.501
AGENCY THAT SEASON EVERYBODY

THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. I

02:34:15.279 --> 02:34:17.014
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT

02:34:17.081 --> 02:34:19.750
THIS AGENCY WOULD HAVE THE

02:34:19.817 --> 02:34:21.418
AUTHORITY TO TELL THE CITY'S

02:34:21.485 --> 02:34:24.221

TO PROCESS SEES AS IT RELATES

02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:28.425
TO MAYBE HOW TO MAKE POLICIES

MORE EFFICIENT AS IT RELATES TO

02:34:30.194 --> 02:34:31.095
TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE

02:34:31.161 --> 02:34:32.763
RAISE MORE REVENUE. AS IT

02:34:32.830 --> 02:34:34.164

THEM TO COME TOGETHER WE CAN

02:35:44.902 --> 02:35:46.737
