ISSUES RANGING FROM CONGESTION ON THE WATER TO CONGESTION WITH TRUCKS COMING IN AND OUT OF OUR FACILITIES -- AND BASIC INCOMPATIBILITY OF LAND USE ISSUES WHICH WE KNOW THIS COMMUNITY I'M SORRY THIS COMMITTEE IS IS INTERESTED IN. MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE SACRIFICING OUR ABILITY TO USE. OUR DEDICATED THAILAND STRESS RESOURCES BETTER DEDICATED TO WATERFRONT USES -- AND SURRENDERED TO USES WHICH ARE PURELY MUNICIPAL OR LOCAL -- REGIONAL IN NATURE BUT DON'T NEED TO BE WATER DEPENDENT. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE SETTING UP A PROCESS FOR THE ETS AND THEIR STADIUM AND THEIR HOUSING AND THEIR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT -- TO BE ABLE. TO LOOK AT A PROPERTY IN A WAY WHICH IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH -- THE CURRENCY POOR PLAN OR WITH THE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE IN THAILAND'S TRUSTS AND ADMINISTERED BY STATE LANDS COMMISSION. WE ACTUALLY REFLECT TO REALLY THANK THE AUTHOR FOR PUTTING IN THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THAT HE PUT IN AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS SEVERAL WEEKS AGO -- TO CLARIFY THAT THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL WITH RESPECT TO BE CDC. BUT WITH RESPECTTO THE PROJECT IS MOVING FORWARD THE INTENT THAT YOU HEARD TODAY FROM THE A IS AN FROM THE CITY IS THAT THEY DO INTEND TO HAVE HOUSING ON THE SIDE. THAT ISN'T CURRENTLY LAWFUL AT AND CONSISTENT WITH THE TIME ONCE TRUST RESTRICTIONS SO THAT'S A PROCESS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE. LOOKING AT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD MAKING SURE THAT THOSE RESTRICTIONS WORSE REMAIN ON SITE AND IF THEY ARE REMOVED. THAT WHEN THEY'RE REMOVED THEIR DONE IN A WAY WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH WITH OUR VISION. FOR MAKING SURE THE WATER FROM HIS PRIMARY USE FOR THE SITE AND AND MAKING THE PORT OF OAKLAND. A SEAPORT THAT'S WORKING -- AND ITS ITS HIGHEST OPTIMAL LEVEL. GOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF MY NAME IS A LEASE AND ALL. AND I AM THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE WAREHOUSE UNIONS. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COUNCIL WHICH REPRESENTS SEVENTEEN LOCALS FROM EUREKA. DOWN TO FRESNO -- WE ARE OPPOSED AB ELEVEN NINETY ONE BECAUSE THE BILL WILL ELIMINATE CURRENT PUBLIC TRUST PROTECTIONS. AT HOWARD TERMINAL FOUR DAYS BALLPARK PLAN -- THE PUBLIC TRUST PROTECTIONS FOR RESERVE WATERWAYS FOR NATURAL HABITAT PROTECTION AND MARITIME ACTIVITIES. THIS HAS ALLOWED THE PORT OF OAKLAND TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN THE WEST COAST. OPEN SUPPORT IS A ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. AND SEAPORT ACTIVITY AT THE PORT SUPPORTS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN DIRECT WAGES AND SALARY FOR INDUSTRIAL DRIVES. THAT SUPPORT THE LIVELIHOODS OF MANY BAY AREA RESIDENTS. THIS IS EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND JOBS REGION WIDE IN 20% OF THOSE CITY OF OAKLAND. THE LEGISLATION FAILS TO ADDRESS POLICIES. TO MAINTAIN CURRENT MARITIME INDUSTRY JOBS IN THE PORT AREA. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS. A BUFFER AREA BETWEEN THE WORKING POOR IN THE PROPOSED RESIDENTIAL HOUSING. THE BILL ALSO WAS LACKING. REALISTIC SOLUTIONS. TO FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION CONGESTION. OUR MARITIME WORKFORCE REPRESENTS SOME OF THE HIGHEST SKILLED IN HIGHLY SPECIALIZED BLUE COLLAR LABOR IN NORTH AMERICA. WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE CITY OF OAKLAND IN A SPORT COMMISSION SEEM TO HAVE A NEW VISION OF THE PORT. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE US. THIS IS TROUBLING AND CONCERNING BECAUSE IT REDUCES THE PORT AREA WHICH WAS REDUCES MARITIME WORK OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR THE MARITIME COMMUNITY. THE LEGISLATION SHOULD NOT A RESOURCE SHOULD NOT ENDORSE A REMOVAL. OF THE THAILAND STRESSED FROM THE WATERFRONT PROPERTY WITHIN THE PORT OF OAKLAND OR ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF A HOUSING. SLASH OFFICE SLASH STADIUM SLASH COMPLEX. WHICH IS COMPLETELY INCONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC TRUST ON A WORKING WATERFRONT. WE RESPECTIVELY -- WE RESPECTIVELY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE OUR CONCERNS INTO DEEP CONSIDERATION. AND TO PROTECT OUR MARITIME RELATED JOBS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEIR OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. JOSHUA SHAH FOR SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES OPPOSED TO THE INCOMPATIBLE USES PROPOSED AT THE SITE. ARE THERE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL MISTER BONTA AND DOING SO IS THAT I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN YOU WILL CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE -- WITH YOUR STAKEHOLDERS -- AND TO WITH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION.

OKAY NOW YOU CAN DO -- IF HE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB. EIGHT FORTY NINE THE MISTAKE ON IF YOU COULD JUST HOLD JUST SO WE GET THE NEXT CREW OUT SORRY GO AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB EIGHT FORTY NINE REDISTRICTING. IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE TO LOCAL DEMOCRACY HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ELECTION. DISTRICTS ARE DRAWN CAN HELP DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A COMMUNITY WILL BE FAIRLY REPRESENTED AT THEIR MOST INTIMATE AND CLOSEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT UNLIKE STATE LEVEL REDISTRICTING. THERE ARE VERY FEW REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING LOCAL. REDISTRICTING TO ENSURE THE PROCESS IS FAIR AND TRANSPARENT AND THAT THE PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. ARE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS CURRENTLY LOCAL DISTRICT MAPS CAN BE DRAFTED THEN INTRODUCED AND ADOPTED AT THE SAME. MEETING WITHOUT FIRST BEING PUBLISHED AND SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS NO PUBLIC OUTRAGE REQUIREMENT INCLUDING TO NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES WHO ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE AWARE OF THE PROCESS AB EIGHT FORTY NINE WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY AND CREATE CLEAR STANDARDS. THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL WAS AMENDED COMING OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONCERNS. AS THIS BILL MOVES AHEAD I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT WE ACHIEVE A STRONG BILL THAT GIVES DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES A VOICE AND ESTABLISHES A FAIR. LOCAL REDISTRICTING PROCESS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE MEMBERS WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FORTY NINE R. NICHOLAS HEIGHT ONE POLICY AND LEGAL DIRECTORY. DIRECTOR OF COMMON CAUSE CALIFORNIA AND JONATHAN STEIN HEAD OF VOTING RIGHTS AND SENSES PROGRAMS AT ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE ASIAN LAW CAUCUS WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR -- MEMBERS NICKEL SIDE ON WITH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE. FAIR REDISTRICTING IS CRUCIAL AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ENSURE REPRESENTATIVE AND INCLUSIVE DEMOCRACY. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO A GOOD JOB OF ENCOURAGING THE RESIDENTS PARTICIPATING REDUCING PROCESS AND DRAWING MAPS OF LOGICAL BOUNDARIES TO REFLECT THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER MANY OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT. UNFORTUNATELY IN MANY INSTANCES USING THE REDUCING PROCESS ABUSE IN A WAY THAT UNDERMINES REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY BY CRACKING COMMUNITIES BE IT RURAL COMMUNITIES WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OR MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THE WAY THE DILUTES THE POWER OTHER VOTE MAKES A MUCH LESS LIKELY SELECTIVE FISHEL'S WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO THEIR CONCERNS. THIS IS IN SIGNIFICANT PART BECAUSE UNLIKE WAS STATE REDUCING THEIR ALMOST NO MANDATORY STANDARDS FOR LOCAL REDISTRICTING TO PREVENT ABUSE. FOR EXAMPLE UNLIKE FOR STATE RE DISTINCT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL REDUCING THE COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE HOLE. IN FACT OTHER THAN EQUAL POPULATION THERE NO MANDATORY STANDARDS AT ALL FOR LOCAL REDUCING JUST DISCRETIONARY CONSIDERATIONS A CAN AND OFTEN ARE IGNORED. AND UNLIKE THE STATE'S EXTENSIVE HEARING PROCESS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST HOLD JUST ONE PUBLIC HEARING FOR DEDUCTING MAPS. OF NO PUBLIC OUR REACH REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT IN FORCING MANY UNDER REPRESENT COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY FAILED TO PARTICIPATE IN LOCAL REDUCING PROCESS IT MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THIS IS OCCURRING. THE SPLITTING OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE STARK UNDER REPRESENTATION OF RACIAL MINORITIES IN CALIFORNIA LOCAL GOVERNMENT. JUST LAST YEAR KERN COUNTY LOS LAWSUIT FOR DRAWING LINES AT THE LIVES OF THE VOTING POWER OF LATINOS AND LAST CYCLE MANY CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS FOR EXAMPLE LACKEY SO YOUR MOUTH F.. REPEATEDLY OBJECTED TO MINORITY COMMUNITIES BEING SPLIT THROUGH LOCAL REDUCING UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AB EIGHT FOUR NINE FOR MAPS ACT IS INTENDED TO BE A SAFETY NET TO STOP THE WORST OF THESE REDUCING ABUSES. DOES SO BY ESTABLISHING MANDATORY RANK REDUCING CRITERIA THAT ARE CLOSELY MODELED OFF THE STATE CRITERIA SO KEEPING NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES WILL BE PRIORITIZED IN THE PROCESS. THE BILL ALSO BANDS FOR THE FIRST TIME PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AB EIGHT FOUR NINE ALSO REQUIRES MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PUTTING MINIMUM FOR HEARINGS REQUIREMENT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ENGAGE IN BASIC COMMUNITY OUR REGION. SO DIVERSE CAME CONSTITUENCIES INCLUDING NON ENGLISH SPEAKING ONCE OR WHERE THE PROCESS CAN ADVOCATE FOR LINES THE BEST FOR LIKE THE COMMUNITIES. TOGETHER THESE CHANGES WE THINK WILL CONTRIBUTE TO MORE REPRESENTATIVE INCLUSIVE AN ACCOUNT OF A LOCAL MARK SEE FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE URGE AND I THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE YOU MOVE ON WITH HOPE RESPECTFULLY WE HAVE A QUORUM SO I JUST WANT TO HAVE -- OR SECRETARY TAKE THE ROLES WE CAN MOVE ON TODAY. AGUIAR-CURRY HERE AGUIAR-CURRY HERE LACKEY. LACKEY HERE. BLOOM BURNER HORVATH. BURNER HER OF HER WRATH HERE RAMOS. RAMOS HERE THREE OF US ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVAS HERE VOEPEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] OKAY. YOU -- MY NAME IS JONATHAN STEIN I'M WITH ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE ASIAN LAW CAUCUS ONE OF SEVERAL CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHT FOUR NINE I'M HERE TO SHARE A STORY WITH YOU OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE -- WHEN THE STORY OF A CITY THAT TRY TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT IN A DISTURBING PROCESS BUT STILL EXEMPLIFIED WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY? SO IN A CITY SHIP FROM OUT LARGE DISTRICT ELECTIONS IT HAS TO HOLD FOR HEARINGS THE CITY OF FREMONT GOT A NOTICE LETTER UNDER THE C. B. R. A. BEGAN A SHIFT TO DISTRICTS. WE FOUND OUT ABOUT AFTER TWO HEARINGS HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND DRAFT MAPS THAT ARE THEN PUBLISHED. THE DRAFT MAPS SPLIT THE CITY'S AFGHAN COMMUNITY INTO TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS DEPENDING ON THE MAP. YOU MAY KNOW THAT FREMONT IS HOME TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST AFGHAN POPULATION OUTSIDE OF AFGHANISTAN. AND YET BECAUSE THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY HAS NO VOICE IN THE CITY'S POLITICS NO AFGHANS HAVE BEEN CONSULTED IN THE PROCESS AND THE DRAFT MAPS HAD ENDED UP -- GERRYMANDERING THEM INTO MULTIPLE DISTRICTS. WE IMMEDIATELY DROPPED OUR OTHER PRODUCTS WE BORROWED IN THE ASKING COMMUNITY WE BEGIN EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY ABOUT DISTRICTS ABOUT. HOW THEY CAN GET INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS AND REPAIR THEM TO STEP FORWARD AND GIVE TESTIMONY? IN THE FIRST TWO DISTRICTING HEARINGS THERE IS ZERO AFGHANS PRESENT IN THE LAST TWO AFGHANS OVER HALF OF THE SPEAKERS NONE OF THEM HAVE EVER SPOKEN TO THEIR CITY COUNCIL BEFORE. THEY SPOKE PASSIONATELY SOMETIMES THE TRANSLATOR BUT HOW IMPORTANT FREMONT WANTS THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY AND HOW IMPORTANT THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY WAS TO FREMONT. THEY SPOKE ABOUT FINDING A NEW HOME AFTER WITHIN ONE TORN BY WAR AND THEY FELT THEY SPOKE ABOUT A FEELING LISTEN TO IN THEIR NEW HOME. THE LONG STORY SHORT IS THE MAPS WERE REDRAWN AND THE AFGHAN CULTURAL AND COMMERCIAL HUB WAS KEPT TOGETHER INTO ONE DISTRICT IT WAS A VICTORY FOR REPRESENTATION IN A FAIR DEMOCRACY. BUT HERE'S THE THING. NO ONE OTHER THAN US REACHED OUT TO THE AFGHAN COMMUNITIES AND TOLD THEM THAT THIS PROCESS WAS EVEN HAPPENING. IF WE HAD A DECIDED TO DO THAT THAT VICTORY WOULDN'T OF HAPPENED. THESE ARE WORKING FOLKS THEY CAN'T TAKE KMART TIME OFTEN THE DAY IF THOSE MEETINGS HAD IT BEEN A NIGHT. THIS VICTORY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. THERE WERE NO TRANSLATORS ON HAND -- OTHER THAN COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE WILLING TO HELP THEIR FELLOW -- NEIGHBORS IF THAT WASN'T TRUE THIS VICTORY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AND IT TOOK US TIME TO ORGANIZE AND TO EDUCATE AND TO MOBILIZE IF THERE'D BEEN JUST ONE HEARING AS UNDER CURRENT LAW AND REDISTRICTING. THAT VICTORY WOULDN'T OF HAPPENED. IN FREMONT LITERALLY EVERYTHING WENT RIGHT NOW -- BUT IF ONE THING HADN'T THAT COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE BEEN SLICED AND DICED IN SILENCE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY OF THE OF THAT MISTER MAPPING IN PLACE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO CREATE LOCAL REDISTRICTING PROCESS SEES WHERE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WHAT COMMUNITIES HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE TO MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD AND DRAWING A TRAP MAPS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT -- A NUMBER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION FEEL AS THOUGH THAT THERE COMPLY THERE'S A COMPLIANCE BURDEN INVOLVED WITH THIS BILL AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MANY WITH THOSE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOWEVER THE BURDENS TO VOTERS. LIVING UNDER DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS THEY DON'T FULLY REPRESENT THEM THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THE COMMUNITIES THE MEANT TO SERVE THAT ITSELF IS A FORMER BURDEN AS WELL. UP WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON A BE A FOUR NINE THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YEAH. I'M SORRY.

WERE CAUGHT OFF GUARD WHEN WE SAW YOU KNOW THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MEMBERS EVER DROPPED IN INTO THE MEASURE WITHOUT ANY WARNING OR ANY. WORK TOWARDS COLLABORATION ON THE FRONT AND RATHER THAN HAVING TO BE REACTIVE AND AND AND OPPOSE AND SO UNFORTUNATELY STILL DO OPPOSE THE BILL -- YOU KNOW WITH THE THE THE FREMONT EXAMPLE I THINK OUR MEMBERS DO TAKE SOME EXCEPTION TO TO THE THE EXAMPLE I OUTLINED BY THE SPONSORS -- THIS IS ALSO THE SAME YOU KNOW WHEN WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FIFTY WITH THESE WITH THESE FOLKS AS CO SPONSORS -- THERE WILL BE THE SAME GENTLEMAN WHO TESTIFIED AROUND THE FREMONT ISSUE WAS ALSO THE SAME GENTLEMAN WHO -- SPOKE TO ALL OF MY MEMBERS AND THANKING THEM FOR COLLABORATION AND AND ACTUALLY SAYING THAT WE NEED MORE TIME FOR OUTREACH WITH REGARDS TO THE PROVISIONS OF AB THREE FIFTY WHICH THE LEAGUE WASN'T STRONG SUPPORTER OF HOWEVER. SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS -- ON THE COALITION OR NOT THEY WANTED A TIGHTER TIME LINE -- SUFFICE IT TO SAY -- CITIES HAVE BEEN GOOD ACTORS IN THE SPACE -- THE MEASURE -- EVEN AS AMENDED REQUIRES A TO SIX PUBLIC HEARINGS -- DIFFERENT LOCATIONS -- AFTER SIX PM AND ON WEEKENDS -- LIVE TRANSLATION SERVICES FOR A FOR A FOR ALL APPLICABLE LANGUAGES FOR EACH YOU KNOW ASKED TERM BY THE CENSUS. AUDIO VISUAL RECORDINGS WHY WE HAVE TO CREATE A WHOLE HOST OF NEW WEB WEB PAGES WITHIN OUR WITH OUR WEBSITE -- NEW REPORTS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE REQUIRED -- MAPS MAPS AND MEETING POSTINGS THAT EXCEED THE BROWN ACTING AS WE KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS FOLKS HERE WHO HAVE SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT KNOW JUST HOW STRANGE IN THE BROWN ACT IS -- HOW WE HAVE CITY OFFICIALS AND CITY STAFF REALLY TRY IN IN STRUGGLE TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE BROWN ACT -- NOW THIS ADDITIONAL POSTING OF SEVEN DAYS -- TO DIFFERENT FOR THESE NASTY POSTED UP FIVE DAYS TO AN ADVANCE FOR FOR PUBLIC HEARINGS -- BUT YOU KNOW IT NOT TO MENTION THE CAT TO THE FACT THAT WHICH I DO KNOW THAT SOMEONE OUT OF THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE -- BUT THE ABSOLUTE ABSORBENT COSTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAD THERE AT THAT IS GOING TO BE BURDEN WAIT WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF UNFUNDED OR SUSPENDED MANDATES WE'VE SEEN IT SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND FOUR ELECTIONS ELECTION COST HAD NOT BEEN REIMBURSED TO CITIES AND COUNTIES WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL -- YOU KNOW. I I THINK FROM A FROM A HOLISTIC STANDPOINT -- AND I SAID THIS IN THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AS WELL I THINK THIS BILL MAKES A BROAD ASSUMPTION THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ACTIVELY WORKING AGAINST TO DISENFRANCHISE. THE VOTERS SAID THAT THEY REPRESENT AND WE RE WE SHOULD WE TAKE STRONG EXCEPTION TO THIS BECAUSE IF YOU YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE EXAMPLES FROM THE SPONSORS WERE REALLY DUMBFOUNDED AS TO WHY WE COULDN'T WORK CLOBBER LEE ON THIS ARE ASK IS THAT YOU SAY NO TO THIS. BILL TODAY WE WE WE DO NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS VEHICLE WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO HAVE TO TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS INTRODUCED A VEHICLE THAT WE CAN ALL GET BEHIND -- WE REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEALING GIVENS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION THIS TIME -- THIS FOR THE LAST DECADE -- THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN ENCOURAGING -- PUBLIC AGENCIES TO MOVE TO BUY DISTRICT ELECTIONS. AND NOW WITH THIS BILL WE'RE GOING TO PUT A HUGE UNFUNDED MANDATES AND WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE -- MAKE THIS CHANGE THEY ALSO THOSE WHO ARE BEEN CONSIDERING MAKING THE CHANGE ON THEIR OWN VERSUS BEING FORCED TO DO SO -- BY LAWSUITS ARE LIKELY GOING TO CHOOSE TO NOT MOVE TO BUY DISTRICT ELECTIONS KNOWING THAT IF THEY MAKE THE SWITCH. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INCUR ALL OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT EVEN A NUMBER OF OUR SPECIAL DISTRICTS JUST BY VIRTUE OF THE TYPE OF AGENCY THEY ARE AREN'T EVEN ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT EVEN IF THE STATE WERE. TO REIMBURSE THE PUBLIC AGENCIES THROUGH THE BAD DATE. SAYS A LOT OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS ON EVEN ELIGIBLE. FOR JUST FOR THIS COMMITTEE THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT SERVE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IF THAT NOW UNDERSTAND THAT MOST OF THEM AT THIS POINT ART BY DISTRICT ELECTIONS IN THIS WOULD APPLY TO THEM. BUT THERE THE THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING IF WE TOOK. AND JUST SAID THAT THAT THEY HAD TO DO FOR MEETINGS EACH NOT EVEN THE SIX ARE REQUIRED BY THE BY THIS BILL SPECIAL DISTRICT WILL BE HOLDING FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MEETINGS ON REDISTRICTING IN YOUR JUST IN YOUR DISTRICTS THAT'S JUST A SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE SCHOOL. DISTRICTS THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE CITIES THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE COUNTIES. DURING THIS PROCESS WE'RE ALSO GONNA BE TRYING TO REACH OUT AND CONTRACT -- FOR MAPPING CONSULTANTS TO SHOW UP TO THESE MEETINGS. THERE SIMPLY AREN'T ENOUGH MAPPING CONSULTANTS IN EXISTENCE RIGHT NOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS. ALSO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUR LEGAL COUNSEL AT THESE MEETINGS. THAT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY HOURS -- PIECE FOR MOST OF THESE BUT A LOT OF TIME CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS SHARE THIS COUNCIL SWITCH MEETINGS ARE THEY GONNA GO. TO THEIR THESE MEETINGS AGAIN BE HAPPENING THE SAME TIME NIGHTS WEEKENDS DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. THE THE THE IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PUBLIC AGENCIES TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL.

ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND THAT PROJECTS ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL EXTRACT EXACTIONS NOT CODIFIED IN ANY FEE SCHEDULE. ALL OF THESE FACTORS COMBINED TO MAKE DEVELOPMENT RISKIER MORE COSTLY AND ALTERNATELY SERVE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING THE GETS BUILT IN OUR STATE. THE BILL ALSO WILL REQUIRE A LOCAL AGENCY TO POST ON ITS WEBSITE.

FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY WAITING ON WITNESSES THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY I'LL START. THE COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON ONCE AGAIN MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND NOTE THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. TOO MUCH OF THE HOUSING DATA COLLECTED AT THE STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL IS NOT ASSESSABLE STANDARDIZED WERE ORGANIZED IN A MANNER THAT LEVERAGES OUR EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OF HOUSING. RESEARCHERS AND ADVOCATES TO ADDRESS THIS THE SHORTFALL A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE HAS. THERE ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND BETTER DATA. ON THE TRANSPARENCY SIDE THE BILL REQUIRES CITIES AND COUNTIES TO PUBLISH A VARIETY OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE DATA. INCLUDING FEES APPLICABLES A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IT ALSO REQUIRES LOCAL AGENCIES TO REPORT ON INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESS THEY ARE MAKING ON APPROVING HOUSING INCLUDING. THE NUMBER OF DISCRETIONARY PERMITS BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY THEY HAVE ISSUED ON THE DATA SIDE A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TO DEVELOP A STATEWIDE PARCEL DATE DATABASE THAT WILL PROVIDE AN OPEN AND FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR ORGANIZING THE STATE'S HOUSING DATA. FINALLY THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE A CD TO DEVELOP A TEN YEAR DATA STRATEGY. IN THE STATE HOUSING PLAN TO ENSURE THAT ALL FUTURE DATA REQUIREMENTS ARE COORDINATED AND THAT JURISDICTION'S ARE SUPPORTED IN THEIR ROLES. TO EXPLAIN THE IMPACT OF THESE POLICY CHANGES I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY EMPTY -- IN DC COMMISSIONER NICK TO SUFFER WHAT'S AND ANDREW BECAUSE THAT ARE WITH CBI [inaudible] WELCOME. I'VE -- GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS ONCE AGAIN MY NAME'S INJURED BECAUSE IT ARE IN THE SCIENCES LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR CPA CPA IS PLEASE TO SPONSOR AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT FEES SPECIAL TAXES AND PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE HOW MUCH FEES TAXES AND ASSESSMENT AFFECT THE COST OF A NEW HOME. AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER A RECENT STUDY BY UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOUND VOTE FOR FEES COST UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUSING UNIT. AND THAT THE AND THE DETERMINING THE ACTUAL FEES FREQUENTLY LACKS TRANSPARENCY CLEARLY NOT KNOWING ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PRICE TAG CREATES TROUBLES UNCERTAINTY FOR THE HOME BUILDER AND ALSO THE FUTURE HOME OLDER. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE HELPS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO REPORT THE FEES AND TAXES THAT THEY ASSESS AND NOTHING MORE. BY POSTING THIS INFORMATION PUBLICLY ACADEMICS CAN STUDY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN FEES TAXES AND HOMEBUILDING. CITIES CAN COMPARE THEIR FEES AND HOMEBUILDING TO THEIR PEERS ELECTED OFFICIALS CAN MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS AND DISCUSSION ABOUT HOUSING CONSTRUCTION CAN BE HAD BASED UPON CLEAR DATA. AS CALIFORNIA'S TROUBLES WITH A HOUSING CRISIS SO TRANSPARENCY IS SORELY NEEDED AND IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE UNCERTAINTY AND TO HELP -- ENCOURAGE HOMEBUILDING FOR THESE REASONS CDA SUPPORTS FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE RESPECTFULLY ASK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS NICK JUST STUFF WHICH I AM A COMMISSIONER ON THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HIT TODAY'S AN INDIVIDUAL COLLABORATING WITH THE OFFICE THIS OFFICE ON THIS BILL. THIS MEASURE IS ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT CURRENT LAWS POLICIES AND REGULATIONS TO DELIVER THE HOUSING PRESERVE EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PROTECTING STABILIZE HOUSING FOR EXISTING RESIDENTS. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS THE VEHICLE TO FILL GAPS IN EXISTING DATA INCLUDING FEE DATA AND DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE DATA. I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FOCUS ON DATA THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND DIRECTLY PERTINENT TO UPHOLDING RULES. THAT LEGISLATURE'S PASSED AND INFORMING AFFECTED HOUSING POLICY. AS AN MTC COMMISSION A AND T. A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS A VITAL AND FLEXIBLE TOOL AS WELL. AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ENCOURAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE DATA SIMPLY ISN'T THAT TO PROPERLY UNDERSTAND THE BARRIERS AND TO THE DESIGN TARGETED INCENTIVES. THIS MEASURE CREATES A RELIABLE POP AND PO'S WITH A TRYING TO TAILOR LOCAL HOUSING SOLUTIONS TO GET THE DATA THEY NEED. FOR EXAMPLE MONTEREY COUNTY MIGHT NEED DATA FOCUSED ON PHAM WAKA HOUSING WELL ANTI CO CCAC MIGHT BE SEEKING DETAILS ON THE NUMBER OF RENT CONTROL UNIT CITY'S JURISDICTION. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WE NEED TO GET BEYOND ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACHES TO ADDRESS HOUSING NEEDS FRONT OF US STATE. I ASK YOU FOR AN AYE VOTE ON A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE AS A FLEXIBLE TOOL TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT AND ADOPT A STATES ROBUST HOUSING POLICY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CHRIS OF OUR FOR FACEBOOK IN SUPPORT.

AND IF THE WITNESSES COULD TALK CLOSE INTO THE MICROPHONE. OKAY WELCOME GO AHEAD THANK YOU THANK YOU SURE THANK YOU MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY -- I THINK EVERYONE AGREES IN THE STATE WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOMES BUILT MORE HOMES FOR CAN YOU WERE SAYING THE CHALLENGES OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN TERMS OF THE COST OF LIVING -- THE INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- IT'S DIFFICULT NOW IF YOU'RE A TEACHER DOT. NURSE OR A COP TO LOOK TO ACTUALLY AFFORD A MIDDLE CLASS LIFESTYLE CERTAINLY MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW MANY OF US. ARE EXPERIENCING THAT -- THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOMES I THINK WE NEED OF THREE POINT FIVE MILLION MORE HOMES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST -- NUMBER OF PEOPLE VERSUS LOS NUMBER OF HOMES IN THE COUNTRY THINK OR FORTY EIGHT IN THE NATION IN TERMS OF THAT STATISTIC -- SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DO IT HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT -- I HAVE A BILL HERE THAT WOULD ENSURE THE TIMELY APPROVAL OF COMPLIANT HOUSING PROJECTS THROUGH A STREAMLINE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS. FOR MIXED INCOME OR MISSING MIDDLE DEVELOPMENTS -- AND BASICALLY WHAT AB -- FOURTEEN EIGHTY FIVE DO WILL EXPAND EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL STREAMLINING LAW TO ENCOURAGE A MODERATE INCOME HOUSING PRODUCTION -- I AM. ACCEPTING A PROPOSED AMENDMENT BY THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION APA TO ALIGN THE DEFINITION OF MODERATE INCOME HOUSING TO AN EXISTING DEFINITION AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. AND I'M WORKING ON AN ADDITIONAL -- AMENDMENT PROPOSED BY A PAY TO CLARIFY HOW THE INTERPLAY WITH LOCAL ORDINANCES WILL WORK -- I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL -- IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT -- ONE I THINK WE'LL GET A LOT OF GOOD SUPPORT ON IT I'M HERE TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT PROCESS. I WILL ASK FOR AYE THOUGH AND I WILL ASK. MY MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES IN A ADVOCATES HERE TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND TALK ABOUT WHY THEY'RE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MADAM CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S MATT REGAN I'M HERE FROM THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. WE ARE IN BUSINESS SPONSORED PUBLIC POLICY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION LIKE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THE BAY AREA'S LARGEST EMPLOYERS ARE MEMBERS -- AND THEY TELL US EVERY DAY THAT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE OF CONCERN FOR THEM IS THE HOUSING CHALLENGE IN OUR REGION -- IT'S NO SECRET TO ANY OF US THAT THERE'S A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE BAY AREA WHICH IS NOT EXPANDED TO AND ACROSS THE THE WHOLE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERS ARE TELLING US IS A EVERY DAY THAT THEY CANNOT HIRE PEOPLE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO THEY CAN'T GROW THEIR BUSINESSES THEY CAN EXPAND AND IT'S PRIMARILY IN THE MIDDLE INCOME JOBS ACTOR THEY'RE HAVING THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AND THAT'S PRIMARILY BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THAT INCOME SECTOR CAN'T AFFORD. TO LIVE IN OUR REGION. THERE'S A HUGE DOUGHNUT HOLE IN OUR HOUSING SUPPLY PIPELINE -- THERE'S A SMALL -- AT NUMBER OF UNITS THAT CAN BE SUBSIDIZED THERE'S A SMALL NUMBER OF UNITS THAT CAN BE BUILT BY MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS AND THOSE ARE COMING IN AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR AND UP -- BASIC CONSTRUCTION COSTS SO THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER A HOMEOWNER SAVE WITH TWO TWO TEACHER SALARIES CAN'T AFFORD MARKET RATE HOUSING AND THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING AND NOT DOUGHNUT HOLE GETS BIGGER EVERY DAY. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS MAKE THAT DONUT HOLE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER AND WE ARE CHEN AYE VOTE THANK YOU? THANK YOU DURING OUR CURRENT AND MEMBERS MICHAEL LANG WITH SILICON VALLEY AT HOME NINE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ONE OF THE KEY POINTS FOR US IS THAT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE FINITE VERY PRECIOUS SUBS AT SEVENTY DOLLARS FOR FORMAL HOUSING. TO EXTENT WE CAN ALLOW THE MARKET TO STREAMLINE MODERATE MIXED INCOME DEVELOPMENTS THAT'S ACTUALLY MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO BE ABLE TO TO PRODUCE THIS HOUSING BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE WITH THOSE MORE MORE HOUSEHOLDS WHO DON'T HAVE. YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING BUT ALSO CAN'T REALLY COMPETE FOR MARKET RATE UNITS THIS BILL WILL HELP ADDRESS ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND ALLOW US TO TO SAVE THOSE THOSE OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS MORE DEEPLY AND COME TARGETED -- DEVELOPMENTS.

THE MAN CHAIR AND THEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. EIGHT FIFTY FOUR A VERY SIMPLY ARE LEGISLATION THIS LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU WOULD ADD SIX SEATS TO THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICTS FIVE MEMBER BOARD OF DIRECTORS. BEGINNING WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS. EACH NEW SEAT WOULD REPRESENT A RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT THAT IS SERVED BY ID. AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW A SEPARATE PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT TO BE FORMED THAT WOULD PROVIDE ELECTRICAL SERVICES THE PEOPLE OF RIVERSIDE. AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES WITH A DULY ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVE. LIKE OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ID'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE ELECTED INTO OFFICE BY VOTERS. IN THIS INSTANCE ELIGIBLE VOTERS ARE ONLY THOSE LIVING WITH AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. STATED DIFFERENTLY IDEAS RIVERSIDE COUNTY VOTERS ARE DENIED AT THE ABILITY TO PICK THEIR REPRESENTATIVE TO THEIR PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY EVEN THOUGH THEY RECEIVE THE SAME SERVICE. FROM ID AS IMPERIAL COUNTY DOES. THIS BODY RIGHTFULLY. GIVES ITS UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT WHEN PROTECTING VOTING RIGHTS. AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR THE NINETY TWO THOUSAND DISENFRANCHISED VOTERS WHO ARE IMPACTED BY ID BUT HAVE NO SAY. WHO SITS ON THE BOARD? THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR THOSE WHO REPRESENT YOU IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. EACH OF US WHO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SERVING OUR CONSTITUENTS KNOWS THIS AND IT IS OUR DUTY TO PULL THAT RIGHT WITH EVERY FIBER IN OUR BODY. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY TWO WITNESSES -- THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF INDIO LUPE RAMIS IS THAT A MYTH. A MYTH PLEASE YOU AND MOVE THE MICROPHONE CLOSE YES. BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR OF THE OUT OF COOLEY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LOU BUT ALMOST I'M ME. I AM THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF INDIA AND SIXTEEN YEAR MEMBER ON THE INDIA CITY COUNCIL. AND PAST CHAIR OF THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT. ENERGY CONSUMER ADVISORY COMMITTEE THE ECAC. MY CITY OF EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND EIHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND POPULATION ISN'T WITHIN AYE ID ENERGY SERVICE AREA. BUT HAS NO SAY IN WHO REPRESENT THEM ON AYE ID'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE SIMPLY DO NOT GET A VOTE ON WHO SITS ON THE AYE ID BOARD. I I D. CLAIMS MY CITY IS REPRESENTED ON THE ECAC BOARD. THIS SIMPLY IS NOT THE CASE. ANYONE SITTING ON THE ECAC. MUST HAVE AYE AYE DE BOARD APPROVAL. MEANING THAT I I D. MUST FIRST APPROVE THE APPOINTMENT. AND THEN CAN REMOVE ANY OPPOSITION FROM ECAC WITHOUT CAUSE. THIS RECENTLY HAPPENED TO MY NEIGHBORING CITIES REPRESENTATIVE MAYOR PRO TEM STEVE SANCIOUS. MY COLLEAGUE MAYOR PRO TEAM SANCIOUS SIMPLY RAISE THE QUESTION AS TO WHY THE COACHELLA VALLEY CITIES DID NOT HAVE EQUAL REPRESENTATION ON THE AYE AYE DE BOARD. AND FOR THAT REASON WAS PROMPTLY REJECTED AT THE TIME OF REAPPOINTMENT WITHOUT BECAUSE THEIR EXPLANATION. AND FOR THIS REASON I AND MY COLLEAGUE MAYOR PRO TEM MILLER OF THE CITY OF INDIA HAVE PROTESTED. BY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE IN THE ECAC MEETINGS. AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AND FORMER MARINE STEVE'S COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE HE REPRESENTS IS UNQUESTIONABLE. WHICH IS WHY IS IT IS SO INAPPROPRIATE TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE ECAC. SIMPLY FOR VOTE VOICING DISSENTING VIEWS. I DE ID IS APATHETIC AT BEST AND DOWNRIGHT VENGEFUL AT WORST WHEN IT COMES TO HANDLING DISPUTES WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS. AS MRS AND RATE PAYERS. THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE OPINION IS HEARD IS THROUGH THE RIGHT TO VOTE WHICH IS WHY MY CITY AND THE CITIES OF INDIAN WELLS. RANCHO MARAJ PALM DESERT AND LOOKING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. I APPRECIATE TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MEGAN BE MANIFESTING THOUGH. I'M A COULD TELL A RESIDENT A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY IN A LONG TIME ADVOCATE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH A COMMUNITY WELL BEING IN THE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY. I WAS ALSO RECENTLY ELECTED TO THE COULD TELL US CITY COUNCIL. I'M I ALSO REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES OF COULD TELL UP LIVE LIKING THAT AN INDIO IN THIS GAG REGIONAL COUNCIL. I'M HERE TODAY AND REPRESENTATION OF THOUSANDS OF DISENFRANCHISED EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY RESIDENTS IN IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FIFTY FOUR WHICH WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME PROVIDE US WITH THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND WITH REPRESENTATION. IN THE IMPERIAL. IRRIGATION DISTRICT ELECTIONS TO GIVE YOU A PICTURE OF COACHELLA AND THE UNINCORPORATED EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY WE ARE 97% LATINO 85% SPANISH SPEAKING AT HOME. MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME AROUND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND OR LOWER AND WE FACE HIGH RENTS POVERTY AND POLLUTION BURDENS. WE ARE FARM HOME CARE CONSTRUCTION HOTEL AND RESTAURANT WORK FORCE FOR THE REST OF THE VALLEY. COULD TELL IS ABOUT 70% UNDEVELOPED IN RURAL AND THE UNINCORPORATED EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY IS LARGELY AN AND UNDEVELOPED AND PREDOMINATELY RURAL. AND OFTEN THE COMMUNITIES ARE ON PERMITTED BY BUILDING AND AND SAFETY CODES AND STANDARDS. WE ARE A REGION OR INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE DAILY ISSUE WE'RE ALSO A REGION WHERE POLITICAL REPRESENTATION HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY DEFICIENT. THE ISSUE OF AYE ID REPRESENTATION IS ONE THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED FOR YEARS IN THE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY. WITH PARALLEL WITH THEIR STRUGGLES TO IMPLEMENT ASIC INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE ESPECIALLY THE UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES. WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS OFTEN IS ON PERMITTED ILLEGAL AND UNSAFE HAVING BEEN DESIGNED SORT OF OUTSIDE THE REALM OF NORMAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROPHECIES? IN THOSE STRUGGLES RATHER THAN HAVING ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES TO TURN TO WERE LEFT TO DEPEND ON AYE ID STAFF AND ONLY IMPERIAL VALLEY ELECTED OFFICIALS WHOSE INTEREST IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS LARGELY ABOUT. THEIR INVESTMENT AND WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR THE BUSINESS MODEL. IN FACT IT IS WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF RISK THAT I COME TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. BECAUSE WE IN COULD TELL ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING THE ENERGY STATION OF A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY AND WITHOUT AYE ID'S VOLUNTARY. ENERGY PROVISION WE LOSE THAT DEVELOPMENT AND SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S A RISK -- IN THE THE POTENTIAL RATE RETALIATION AND WITHDRAWAL IS REAL TO US. BUT I COME HERE AND STAND FOR THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I'M JOINED BY MY COUNTERPARTS WHICH ARE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY SUCH AS PUEBLO NEEDLE CDC. LEADERS CAMPESINOS ALI ANSWER COACHELLA VALLEY THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR RURAL STUDIES AND MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE SUPPORTED WRITTEN SUPPORT -- TO HAVE SUBMITTED WRITTEN SUPPORT FOR A BI. EIGHT FIVE FOUR YOU DESERVE REPRESENTATION IN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. WE DESERVE ACCOUNTABLE ELECTED LEADERS AND I URGE YOU TO MOVE FORWARD AB EIGHT FIVE FOUR FOR THE WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MADAM CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANTHONY GONZALEZ I REPRESENT THE CITY'S A PALM DESERT MAKITA AND INDIAN WELLS. NOW WE'RE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT ONE OF THANKED AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE SUPPORT. WE ASKED FOR AND I WROTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION BUT BEGIN. MADAM CHAIR MOVE THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION GOOD AFTERNOON YOU CAN START WHENEVER YOU'D LIKE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME THESE FEW MINUTES. CHAIR WOMAN I GEAR CURRY AND MEMBERS OF THE SYSTEM COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NORMA SIERRA GLENDALE. I AM VICE PRESIDENT OF THE I AD BOARD OF DIRECTORS. I TESTIFIED BEFORE YOU. TODAY. IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO A. B.. EIGHT FIVE FOUR THIS BILL LIKELY VIOLATES THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION'S PROHIBITION AGAINST SPECIAL LEGISLATION. AND THE EQUAL PROTECTION AND DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF AYE ID'S CURRENT CONSTITUENTS IN RATE PAYERS. IT CIRCUMVENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY AND SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR ALL SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THE BILL ANALYSIS SAYS THAT THERE IS A LOCAL PROCESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW. AND BY THE LEGISLATURE BY WHICH SERVICE RELATED ISSUES AND GOVERNANCE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE FOUR MAY ALSO VIOLATE THE FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT BECAUSE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BILL. VOTERS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY ARE AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN A MAJORITY. SKEWS ME ON THE ELEVEN MEMBER BOARD. MOREOVER IT LIKELY VIOLATES THE ONE PERSON ONE VOTE REQUIREMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS. BY CREATING DISTRICTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT INCLUDE POPULATIONS TEN TIMES LARGER THAN THOSE IN IMPERIAL COUNTY. IN IMPERIAL COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE PRIMARILY LATINOS. AND OF LOW SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS WHILE THE RESIDENCE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY ARE MUCH LESS SO. FINALLY THIS BILL THREATENS LONG STANDING WATER AND ENERGY SERVICE AREA RIGHTS. I A DIS POWERS AND PURPOSES ARE PERMITTED BY STATE LAW AND DEFINED BY LONG TERM AGREEMENTS. THE NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR COMPROMISED AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN AYE ID THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. THEN THIS NINETY NINE YEAR AGREEMENT WAS INTEGRAL IN RESOLVING LEGAL DISPUTES RELATED TO WATER AND ENERGY RIGHTS. IT HAS PROVIDED CV W. D. ACCESS TO RELIABLE WATER SUPPLIES. AND IT HAS HELPED SECURE ID'S RIGHTS TO SERVE RESIDENTS OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY. PER THE AGREEMENT ID PACEY V. W. D. 8% OF ITS ANNUAL ELECTRICAL SERVICE REVENUES. TO DATE DOES PAYMENTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE MILLION. AND WE PROJECT THEY WILL REACH UP TO SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN THE NEXT FOURTEEN YEARS WHEN THE AGREEMENT REACHES ITS FULL TERM. THE COMPLETE RESTRUCTURE OF ID'S GOVERNANCE UNDER AB EIGHT FIVE FOUR NOW IN JACK'S THE STATE LEGISLATURE INTO THIS PROCESS AND THREATENS THE VIABILITY OF THE COMPROMISE. WHILE THE BILL'S AUTHOR HAS SAID THAT COACHELLA VALLEY RESIDENTS HAVE NO VOICE ON MATTERS RELATED TO ID SERVICES. THEY MOST CERTAINLY DO. ID ENTERED INTO THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT WITH C. V. W. D. AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE ELECTED. BY RESIDENTS OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY. FOR THE RECORD. YOU MUST KNOW THAT ALL OF AYE ID'S CUSTOMERS RECEIVE THE SAME RELIABLE AFFORDABLE SERVICES. WHEN COMPARED TO NEIGHBORING UTILITIES ID'S CUSTOMERS PAY AN AVERAGE OF 50% LESS THAN THEIR MONTHLY POWER BILLS? AB EIGHT FIVE FOUR AM JUSTLY SINGLES OUT THE ID FOR REASONS DRIVEN BY LOCAL POLITICS. AND SETS A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT AND FOR THESE REASONS I BEG YOU TO PLEASE VOTE NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SECOND THE MOTION BY THE WAY. I MEAN OPPOSITION THANK YOU SIR HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. YOU ALSO IN OPPOSITION. YES MA'AM GOOD OUT GOOD AFTERNOON MY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN -- COMMITTEE THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAKING MY NAME IS FRANK OSWALD I'M GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE ID. I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN LETTERS TO MISTER MAYES AND WHAT I THINK OF SOME BILLS WERE MADE TO YOUR COMMITTEE TALKING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITIES OF THIS BILL. YOU NEED TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES RAISED BY THIS PARTICULAR BILL IT'S S. PIECE OF SPECIAL LEGISLATION THAT PURPORTS TO REGULATE INTO AN AREA THAT'S FULLY REGULATED BY. THE GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND IT RAISES CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES OF EQUAL PROTECTION [inaudible] BECAUSE IN MY VIEW IT IS A BILL THAT PROVIDES A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM. THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE AYE ID. THE RATES ARE THE MOST COMPETITIVE IN THE STATE. IT CHARGED VIRTUALLY HALF OF WHAT OUR IMMEDIATE COMPETITOR DOESN'T IN APRIL EXCUSE ME IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THE BILL ALSO WOULD IRONICALLY ENOUGH. CREATE THE ABILITY OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY VOTERS TO CONTROL AN INITIATE ACTIONS ON ASSESSMENTS. AND ASSESSMENTS ARE PRIMARILY AND ALMOST ALWAYS CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED. FOR IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO OWN LAND WITHIN THE DISTRICT THE DISTRICT THE ID'S. LAND IS LOCATED IN IMPERIAL COUNTY NOT RIVERSIDE COUNTY YET THIS WOULD GIVE POWER TO RESIDENTS OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO WITH LEAST INITIATE OR IMPOSE POTENTIAL ASSESSMENTS. SO IF THERE'S A TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION ARGUMENT TO BE MADE. THE IRONY HERE IS THAT IT REALLY POTENTIALLY IMPOSES TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION ON RESIDENTS OF THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. THE MOST TELLING ARGUMENT THOUGH THAT THAT THIS BILL. REALLY PRESENTS AS A PROBLEM IS THE INVASION OF THE WATER RIGHTS THAT ARE HELD BY THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT. THE WATER RIGHTS OUR WATER RIGHTS WERE DEVELOPED AT THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY THE NOTICES OF APPROPRIATION WHERE THE COLORADO RIVER WAS BEING USED TO IRRIGATE FARMLAND IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. AS WELL AS CITIES AND SOME INDUSTRIAL USES. THAT WATER RIGHT HAS BEEN CONSECRATED IN A SERIES OF DECISIONS AND LAWS AND ENACTMENTS BY CONGRESS. ALL OF WHICH ARE EMBODIED IN THE REAL UNDER THE RUBRIC OF THE LAW OF THE RIVER. AT THE PRESENT TIME THE IMPLICATION DISTRICT HOLD A WATER RIGHT IN TELLING THAT TO THREE POINT ONE MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER PER YEAR. IT IS THE SINGLE LARGEST CONTRACTOR WHO CAN TAKE WATER OUT OF THE COLORADO RIVER. ON THE RIVER. IT EXCEEDS ANYBODY ANY OTHER SINGLE USER OF THE RIVER AND THE SOLE SOURCE OF WATER FOR THE IMPERIAL VALLEY IS THE COLORADO RIVER. IF YOU DELEGATE CONTROL OF THE AYE ID BOARD TO RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN RIVER SIDE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THEN AND RIVERSIDE. WHO HAVE NO HISTORICALLY INTEREST IN FARMING OR THE ACTIVITIES OF IMPERIAL COUNTY? CONTROLLING WHAT THE ID DOES WITH RESPECT WAS WATER RIGHTS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE HI ID OR NOR ITS PEOPLE CAN LIVE WITH. IT'S AN ABSOLUTE NO NO IN FACT IT COULD EVEN BE A TAKING. BECAUSE IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS LEGISLATION BY FIAT WOULD TAKE THAT WATER RIGHT AWAY AND CONFERRED ON A BODY OF PEOPLE WHO MAY BE WELL INTENTIONED. AND MAY HAVE THE RIGHTS OF THEIR OWN. RESIDENTS AND VOTERS IN THEIR HEARTS BUT IT TAKES AWAY SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY RIGHT THAT HAS EXISTED FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IMPERIAL COUNTY. THE THE OTHER ISSUES ARE. THAT ARE RAISED HERE ARE VOTING RIGHTS ISSUES WOULD HAVE BEEN RAISED BY LETTER AND SUBMITTED TO YOU. IT VIOLATES POTENTIALLY THE ONE PERSON ONE VOTE RULE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO ADD A TREMENDOUS THE HUGE POPULATION BASE TO THE REPRESENTATION OF THE ID BOARD. AND EFFECTIVELY DISENFRANCHISED THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IMPERIAL COUNTY. AND REMEMBER THIS. THE BILL COUNTY IS 85290% LATINO. IT IS ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NOT THE NATION 2225%. HISTORIC ENDEMIC AND PERSISTENT UNEMPLOYMENT. THE PEOPLE OF IMPERIAL VALLEY AND IMPERIAL COUNTY HAVE VIRTUALLY NOTHING IN COMMON. WITH THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE CAME. TO AND LESS IN COMMON. A LITTLE MORE BUT NOT QUITE AS MUCH WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE IN INDIA. HISTORICALLY THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE POSITION BETWEEN THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT WHICH IS. HAS THE WATER RIGHTS SERVICE TO THE AREA SUPPLIED. IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY TWO THERE BEEN A SERIES OF ADVERSE ACTIONS BETWEEN COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT AND THE PILLAR CATION DISTRICT WHICH CULMINATED IN THE NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR COMPROMISE AGREEMENT WHICH COULD CHILL VALLEY WATER DISTRICT. SEATED AND GAVE UP. ITS RIGHTS TO DISTRIBUTE ENERGY IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY AREA. IN RETURN THERE WAS PEACE IN THE BOULDER GET BOULDER CANYON PROJECT FOR THE TIME BEING. AND THE ID INSTEAD OF ANNEXING C. V. W. D. AS IT WAS AUTHORIZED TO DO AGREED NOT TO DO THAT SINCE THEN -- BEEN AT LEAST TWO LAWSUITS BETWEEN CAL COULD CHILL VALLEY WATER DISTRICT AND THE ID CONCERNING. THE NET PROCEEDS IN TERMS OF THE HELLO THE 8% ROYALTY IT IS TO BE PAID BY THE IDEA IN CONNECTION WITH ITS POWER. GENERATION. THIS AS CHRISTY OR EXCUSE ME DIRECTOR GLINDA SHELTON WAS PLAIN TO YOU IT'S BECAUSE EIGHT FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND TRANSFERS HAVING TO BE MADE BY THE ID. TO COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT. NOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN COULD CHILLED OUT OF WATER DISTRICT WOULD NOW UNDER THIS BILL. HAVE THE CONTROL OF THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT. HOW CAN YOU? FLY IN THE FACE OF HUNDRED YEARS OF OPPOSITION AND DIFFERENCES OF INTEREST. YEAH BUT IF NOTHING ELSE IT VIOLATES THE RIGHT NOT TO ASSOCIATE WHICH IS ALSO CONSECRATED. AND OUR FEDERAL CONSTITUTION SO. I'D LEAVE IT AT THAT I JUST THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AND CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITIES AT THIS BILL. HAS TO ADDRESS AND CANNOT ADDRESS AND I WILL CALL UPON YOU. TO DO YOUR DUTY IN THIS A SITUATION OF THE THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES THAT YOU WILL DECIDE WHETHER NOT TO PASS A SET OF COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS CALIFORNIA SPENDING CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. PATRICK ROACH FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU. CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES RESPECTFULLY FLEA OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WAS THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SUGGEST OR DID YOU TAKE AWAY I GUESS THAT MIGHT BE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WHAT IS ANY. ANY ISSUES THAT ANYBODY HAS ON THIS THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. TO ADDRESS THEM YES. SEVEN MEMBER TO REVERSE. THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS -- BROUGHT UP REGARDING REPRESENTATION -- IN THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY RESIDENTS ABILITY -- TO HAVE REPRESENTATION ON THE SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT USUALLY THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS GO THROUGH A LOCAL PROCESS FIRST AND I BELIEVE THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE NOT HAPPENED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- SO THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I FEEL LIKE UNTIL THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE. I FEEL THIS BILL IS A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE AND I CANNOT SUPPORT IT WHAT. THE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD RECONSIDER -- Là NOT SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND I WILL -- I'LL TELL YOU WHY -- I WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD MORE CONVERSATIONS IN REGARDS. TO THIS -- TO THIS BILL AND IN FACT -- OF THOUGH IT SEEMS AS THOUGH FOR SOME THAT THINK THAT ID IS ONE OF MY FOES IT IS NOT. A THEY DO PROVIDE FANTASTIC SERVICE -- AS AS THEY BOTH THE HAD TALKED ABOUT. AND I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE CONTINUED THIS -- THIS CONVERSATION I ALSO COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I SPENT EIGHT YEARS ON A CITY COUNCIL AND I SPENT FOUR YEARS A CHIEF OF STAFF TO A MEMBER THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND I UNDERSTAND LAUGH CO IN FACT I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS THERE'D BE A MECHANISM IN PLACE OF FOR THE LAUGH BECAUSE A TO A TO ADDRESS THIS. IN FACT THEY HAVE -- THEY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND I THINK WE'VE HANDED OUT COPIES. IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN A IN A REVIEW THAT WAS DOWN BY THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY LAUGH GO ON A DATE IF EVERY TWENTY SECOND. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IF I CAN JUST READ THIS MADAM CHAIR. SINCE THE MAJORITY OF IDEAS SERVICE POPULATION FOR ELECTRICITY IS WITHIN THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE STAFF RECOMMENDS THE DISTRICTS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE BE ESTABLISHED TO INCLUDED SERVICE AREA. AS DEPICTED IN THE ATTACHED EXHIBIT. IN ADDITION STAFF RECOMMENDS ID FORMALLY SUBMITTED ANNEXATION APPLICATION TO INCLUDE THE AREA ESTABLISHED AS ITS FEAR OF INFLUENCE ALLOWING FOR COTERMINOUS FEAR. THIS WOULD ALLOW THIS IMPORTANT PART THIS WOULD ALLOW THE REGISTERED VOTERS WITHIN THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN IDEAS ELECTIONS. CURRENTLY CUSTOMERS WITHIN RIVERSIDE COUNTY ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY ID'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS EACH BOARD MEMBERS RESPONSIBLE FOR DIVISION NONE OF WHICH INCLUDES REGISTERED VOTERS WITHIN THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE. SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I GOT MYSELF INTO FINANCES THIS BILL IF I CAN BE -- CAN BE REAL -- BUT IT SEEMS VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS THE VOTING RIGHTS -- ISSUE THAT WE WANTED BILL TO PROVIDE THIS I IDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE THEY DIDN'T JUST COME UP IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN FACT IT HAS BEEN -- IT IT'S BEEN PROBABLY THIRTY YEAR PROCESS -- AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WHEN IT WAS FORMED OVER. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS AGO -- OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO A NO ONE PROVIDED POWER AT THE TIME AND SO IT MADE SENSE FOR A LOCAL WATER AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE POWER. BUT WHAT ENDS UP WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING OVER TIME IS YOU ENDED UP WITH NINETY TWO THOUSAND VOTERS THAT LIVE WITHIN THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY PORTION. THAT ARE DISENFRANCHISED THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY LASKO SAYS WE WE THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE BUT THEY HAVE NO POWER OVER IMPERIAL COUNTY. NOW YOU HEARD FROM IMPERIAL COUNTY THAT THEY WERE OPPOSED BUT OF COURSE THEY THEY WOULD BE OPPOSED BECAUSE THEY HAVE POLITICAL POWER TODAY IN IMPERIAL COUNTY. MY GOAL WITH THIS LEGISLATION AS I'VE LEARNED IT IS NOT SIMPLE IN FACT I WOULD TELL YOU IF I WAS SITTING BEFORE YOU TODAY. I DON'T THINK THE LANGUAGE -- I WOULD NOT IF I WAS THE GOVERNOR AND THE LANGUAGE BEFORE ME I WOULD NOT SIGN THIS INTO INTO LAW IT NEEDS SOME WORK. IT NEEDS WORK -- AND MY HOPE WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE IMPALER DISPUTATION DISTRICT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THIS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THEM AFTER A MEETING THAT I HAD HELD. IN AT ONE OF THEIR OFFICE TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT I GOT A LETTER FROM THEM I'VE NEVER SAYS NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER LIKE THIS EVER BEFORE FROM A PUBLIC AGENCY THIS IS NOT A PRIVATE AGENCY NOT A NOT A AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY THIS IS A PRIVATE. OUR STATE PUBLIC UTILITY. THEY SAID TO ME IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE VOTING RIGHTS CURRENT OR PROSPECTIVE FOR LEGIBLE RATE PAYERS WHO RESIDE IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. THEY DON'T WANT THE FOLKS IN THE COULD TELL VOWED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE RIGHTS. IN ADDITION THEY SAID. ID CAN SEE NO VALUE IN FURTHER PRIVATE MEETINGS. OR FOR THAT MATTER FUTURE TALKS WITH YOU. SO THE DIFFICULTY IS HERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. BY THE WAY I WANT TO MAKE THIS POINT THE WATER RIGHTS ISSUE IS VERY REAL. AND I HAVE WRITTEN OP ED AND GIVE BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. AFFIRMATION OF THAT I WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO SECURE. THE WATER RIGHTS FOR IMPERIAL COUNTY THOSE ARE SECURE WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW WELL WHAT BY THE WHISKIES FOR DRINKING AND WATERS FOR FIGHTING OVER. AND I WILL FIGHT WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THEIR THEIR WATER RIGHTS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NINETY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. HAVE A RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO TO VOTE -- AND FOR THAT REASON THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE A WE NEED TO CONTINUE. CONTINUE TO HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES. THANK YOU I'M FOR THIS COMES IN THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REAVIS FOR BRINGING UP THOSE. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES AND AND HERE IN A IMPERIAL COUNTY LEFT GOING. NOW AT THE READING OF THAT LETTER AND GOING BACK INTO SOME HISTORY SAYING THAT RIVERSIDE COUNTY LAUGH WAS ALSO. I'M ENGAGED IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A CITY ELECTED AND WORKING FOR A CHIEF OF STAFF ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SITTING AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND CHAIRMAN OF THE LEFT GOING SAN MEDINA COUNTY. WE HAVE WORKED WITH WITH. WITH OTHER COUNTIES TO BRING TOGETHER SO AND SOLVE ISSUES THAT ARE THERE. I DO TO THINK THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE -- PREMATURE TO BE AT THIS LEVEL WHEN THINGS CAN BE WORKED OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL POSSIBLY BY ENGAGING -- BOTH LAUGHED BECAUSE IMPERIAL COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO COME TOGETHER AND WORK OUT THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE THERE ON SPEARS OF INFLUENCES ALL THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND TO COME HERE AND ASK THAT CERTAIN BOARD MEMBERS BE PREDESTINED TO REPRESENT CERTAIN AREAS ISN'T. IN THE WILL OF OF THIS AREA SHOULD BE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE GOING BACK WORKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH IMPERIAL COUNTY LEFT GO. RIVERSIDE COUNTY LAUGH GOING TRY TO COME TOGETHER TO SOME TYPE OF MECHANISM AND RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES. I TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A LITTLE -- PREMATURE TO BE HERE AT THIS STAGE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YES. YEAH IF I COULD JUST ADD -- A COUPLE COMMENTS TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAID YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE BILL I AM MYSELF COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW -- THAT THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS CERTAINLY IS A LONG PROCESS AND THIS IS ONLY YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE STEPS -- AND I SUPPORT THE BILL AND I SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT -- THIS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT VEHICLE TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND I YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT WILL HAVE -- IF IF IF IT DOES PASS WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THOSE LAWS WENT ON THE FLOOR AND I'D. BE HAPPY TO SEE IF ANY -- CHRIS WAS MADE -- BUT CERTAINLY I WOULD HOPE THAT -- THESE THESE BECAUSE THIS LETTER IS REALLY CONCERNED -- AND CERTAINLY IS IS IS IS REALLY -- A COMPELLING LETTER TO ENCOURAGE ME TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS AND REALLY PROJECT THANK YOU. BLOOM -- THANK YOU -- I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS -- BILL TODAY ALSO I'M FRANKLY -- UP PRETTY WELL OUTRAGE -- THAT A LETTER WOULD BE SENT FROM A PUBLIC AGENCY THAT BASICALLY -- SAYS. STILL LATER -- YOU KNOW THERE'S NO NEED TO HAVE ANY DISCUSSIONS HERE IN FACT. NOT ONLY IS THERE NO NEED -- WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU -- I I THINK YOU'VE LAID OUT SOME VERY IMPORTANT. REASONS WHY THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT. BUT FOR ME IF NO OTHER REASON WE SHOULD BE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR FROM A PUBLIC AGENCY IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS [inaudible] WELL -- I HAVE COMMENTS. I'VE HEARD FROM BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES REPRESENTING THE DISTRICT'S AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. THEY HAVE OPPOSING VIEWS ON THIS BILL BUT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL HAS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AND I ID. THE OPPOSING STAKEHOLDERS. MR GARCIA DOES BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO BE HAD. FOR THAT REASON WHILE I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM I AM WILLING TO ALLOW THIS MOVE BILL TO MOVE FORWARD. AND RECOMMENDED I VOTE BY MY COLLEAGUE SO THE CONVERSATION MAY CONTINUE. BEFORE I ASK FOR THE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO THE BOARD OF THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT THAT I'M APPALLED. YOUR REFUSAL IN YOUR LETTER TO MISTER MAYES TO HOLD FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH A MEMBER OF THIS OF THIS BODY WHO IS TRYING TO REPRESENT HIS CONSTITUENTS. YOU MAY NOT LIKE THE PATH THAT HE IS PICKED HAS CHOSEN TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. BUT FOR AN OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE FROM A PUBLIC AGENCY TO A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE TO COMMUNICATE AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. HOW IT'S CONSTITUENTS INTERESTS MIGHT BEST PROTECTED IS INSULTING TO HIS OFFICE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS INSTITUTION? AND QUITE FRANKLY IT'S INSULTING TO ME. SO I'LL ASKYOU AND PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE THE WRONG ANSWER WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MY PERSPECTIVE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ON YOUR AGENCY GOING FORWARD. WILL THE BOARD AND STAFF OF THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT PROMISE THIS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS IN GOOD FAITH WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES AND OR REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS CONSTITUENTS. ON HOW TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INPUT INTO AYE ID'S PUBLIC POWER AGREEMENT HOW PUBLIC POWER AGREEMENT. AND SERVICE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. WE DO IT. I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE BOARD I'M ONLY ONE OF FIVE I WOULD BE MORE THAN DELIGHTED TO BRING IT TO THE BOARD AND GIVE YOU AN ANSWER IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE'VE DISCUSSED IT. FOR MAY MADAM CHAIRMAN I WILL SAY THIS OF THE BOARD AS WE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCES RETAIN THE SERVICES OF A LAW FIRM IN EXPERTS TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE SITUATION WITH RESPECT. TO THE DIFFERENT AREAS BEING SERVED. WITH AT WITH THOSE PLAIN VIEW OF THE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED VIEW ON EXAMINING PATHS GOING FORWARD SO I PERSONALLY DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY WE CAN ENGAGE IN A COLLOQUY WITH. MR MAYS AND TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE GOING TO BE SOLICITING OPINIONS AND VIEWS FROM PEOPLE RIVERSIDE COUNTY AS WELL ALSO ALTHOUGH. OUR DIRECTOR HERE IS NATURALLY CONSERVATIVE ABOUT I CAN SAY YES WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL PROCESS BUT IT HAS TO BE MEANINGFUL. AND I THINK THE BOARD'S CONCERN MORE THAN ANYTHING WAS AT THAT POINT WHERE THE OFFER WAS MADE BY MISTER ASSEMBLY WHEN MAYES THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE A MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION. THE BOARD IS NOT IGNORING THIS. IT'S INSTRUCTED ITS OWN ATTORNEYS AND TO AND EXPERTS IN WITHIN THE NEXT SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS IS GOING TO BE EXPLORING DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES. AS OTHER PATH IN GOING FORWARD BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE. A LOT OF MOVING PARTS AND THAT MAKES IT A DIFFICULT -- SITUATION TO SEE A RESOLUTION IMMEDIATELY ACHIEVABLE AND OF COURSE PART OF THAT IS TO GET YOU KATE ASSEMBLYMAN MAY SO THEY CAN APPRECIATE SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES. AND THAT MAY IN FACT MODERATE SOME OF HIS VIEWS AS YOU RECOGNIZE THE NEED. THAT THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE HANDLED COMPLIMENTED AND DOUBLE KILLED AND WORK TOGETHER TO GET IN THE AN ENTRY LEVEL SOLUTION. SO THANK YOU AND IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH MISTER MAYES AS WELL AS OTHER -- IN THIS PROCESS. I WANT TO THANK YOU TO MY GREAT HOPE THAT THIS COMMITMENT BY THESE PEOPLE HERE WILL GET THIS. TO A EVEN A BETTER BILL IN THE FUTURE AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU'VE SPENT. APPRECIATE MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S TIME THAT HE HAS SPENT ON THIS AS WELL I'M SORRY HE'S NOT HERE TODAY. BUT I THINK THAT YOU CAN COME TO SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION. PRO OR CON WHATEVER BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU GUYS SIT AT THE TABLE. AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH. THANK YOU THANK YOU IF I CAN CLOSE MANAGER. THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS -- IS WELL -- AGAIN IT'S THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT I REALIZED I WAS GOING TO BE IS -- AS BIG OF AN ISSUE AS IT HAS BECOME AND WE'VE ALL SPENT -- QUITE A BIT A BIT OF TIME ON THIS -- I DO THINK IT IS EXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT VOTING RIGHTS. ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN HOLD THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE AN THAT THERE'S TRANSPARENCY IN SO THAT REALLY IS FOR ME GOAL NUMBER. ONE THE SECOND GOAL FOR ME IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WATER RIGHTS IN IMPERIAL COUNTY STAY WITH IMPERIAL COUNTY WITHOUT A SHIRT MAKE SURE TO HOW. TO TO FIGURE THAT OUT. AND THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER QUESTION THAT HAS COME UP THAT I WASN'T SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD BEFORE BUT I NOW KNOW IT'S VERY REAL. AND THAT IS THAT THERE'S THIS FIFTEEN YEAR TIME FRAME I'M IN WHICH THERE IS DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT AND TELL ABOUT A WATER DISTRICT. AND THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHO'S GONNA PROVIDE POWER IN THAT THAT TERRITORY -- IN PERPETUITY THAT QUESTION HAS TO BE ANSWERED I'VE AND THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE SAID I WANT TO GET INTO THIS BUT I DO THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO HAVE A CONVERATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE HAVE GOOD GOVERNMENT AND MAKING SURE THE GOVERNMENT CAN BE ACCOUNTABLE TO ITS PEOPLE SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SECRETARY TAKE THE ROLE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY AYE LACKEY AYE LACKEY AYE BLOOM. BLOOM AYE BURNER HER OF THAT. RAMOS. RAMOS KNOWS THREE OF US. THREE OF US SNOW ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVAS HI VOEPEL I THE MEASURE IS OUT FIVE TWO TWO GOVERNOR OKAY SO EVER COOPER. SENATE BILL [inaudible] ONE FORTY ONE BEGIN. THE MUSIC HERE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. OVER A SPAN OF FOURTEEN YEARS THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER WAS SUSPECTED OF COMMITTING MULTIPLE MURDERS. RAPES KIDNAPPINGS ROBBERIES AND BURGLARIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THE GOAL IS THE KILLER'S CRIMES ARE SO VIOLENT AND WIDE SPREAD OVER THE YEARS THAT HE WAS ALSO KNOWN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE IS THE EASTER RAPIST. BUY SELL YOUR RED SECTOR IN THE ORIGINAL NIGHT STALKER. LAST YEAR JUST OF DEANGELO WAS ARRESTED AS THE GSK SUSPECT. THE TRIAL GSK IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE ON AN EXCUSE ME. IS GOING TO PLACE AN EXPECTED FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE COUNTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRYING THIS CASE. AB ONE FORTY ONE WILL ESTABLISH THE MECHANISM WAS DESCRIPTOR KNEES AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS AFFECTED COUNTIES BE ABLE TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXTRAORDINARY COST. WITH YOUR WITNESSES FROM SEVERAL COUNTY SUPERVISOR DIFFERENCE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MORGAN GEYER IT'S SECOND OKAY PUBLIC DEFENDER STEVE STEVEN GARRETT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- IT IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS AB ONE FORTY ONE I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER FOR BRINGING THE BILL MY NAME IS MORGAN GEYER. I AM A SUPERVISING DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY DA'S OFFICE -- I HELP OVERSEE OUR CONVICTION INTEGRITY AND POST CONVICTION UNIT. AND IT IS AN HONOR TO BE SITTING ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE TABLE AS MY STEAM CALLING MISTER GARRETT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR SEGMENT. THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS CASE OF THE CASE AGAINST MR D'ANGELO CAN'T BE OVERSTATED -- WE ARE EXPECTED AS PROSECUTORS AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO HANDLE A LOT OF CASES WE ARE EXPECTED TO HANDLE A LOT OF BIG CASES. BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED US OR BEEN ANTICIPATED WITH REGARD TO THE VOLUME OF THIS CASE -- JUST TO GIVE AN IDEA OF SOME OF THE LOGISTICS INVOLVED. THIS CASE SPANS WITH AN INVESTIGATION THAT SPANS OVER FORTY YEARS. ON THERE ARE THIRTEEN PEOPLE WHO WERE MURDERED THERE WERE. NEARLY FIFTY PEOPLE WHO WERE RAPED. THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED BURGLARIES. THE THE VOLUME OF INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE IS STAGGERING. NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS AND NOT ONE SINGLE COUNTY SHOULD HAVE TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN -- THE THE BURDEN THAT COMES FROM. THIS KIND OF UNANTICIPATED EXPENSES. WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE OPERATIONS OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN PLACE AN ENORMOUS BURDEN ON THE DA'S OFFICE ON THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. THAT WOULD RESULT IN DELAY. AND DELAY RESULTS IN. JUSTICE THAT IS DENIED FOR THE ACCUSED DELAYS PREJUDICIAL TO THE ACCUSED. AND IT DENIES. JUSTICE TO THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS WHO HAVE WAITED A VERY LONG TIME TO SEE THE STAY CALM. THE PRE TRIAL. ASPECTS OF THE CASE WILL RESULT IN EXTRAORDINARY COSTS AND BURDENS THE TRIAL WILL BE. LOGISTICAL FEAT TO PUT TOGETHER WITH. OVER ELEVEN COUNTIES INVOLVED COMPRISING OVER ONE THIRD OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SOMETHING LIKE THIS QUITE SIMPLY HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE. THE COSTS OF A LARGE CASE ARE ALWAYS ANTICIPATED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND THE COSTS THAT WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH PUTTING ON THIS TRIAL IN SACRAMENTO WILL BE EXTRAORDINARY. AND AB ONE FORTY ONE PROVIDES A MEASURE TO RELIEVE THAT BURDEN ON THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE THE DA'S OFFICE ON THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO OFFSET THOSE EXTRAORDINARY COSTS THAT QUITE SIMPLY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED BEFORE [inaudible] THE PROCESS SHOULDN'T BE DELAYED BECAUSE THERE AREN'T SUFFICIENT FUNDS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONE COUNTY SIMPLY CANNOT BEAR ON ITS OWN. SO WITH THAT I WILL. BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER GARRETT. BUT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE WILL CHAIR OF MARBLE MEMBERS I'M STEVE KERR ITEM THE SECOND COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU. AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE BILL WHICH THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO HAS PUT FORWARD -- A YOU KNOW IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER ARE IN AGREEMENT BUT AND WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON THE SIZE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF OF WHAT WE ARE FACING HERE -- AND AND I WANT TO BE I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR IT BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POTENTIAL CRIME SCENES. I MEAN THAT ALONE IS STAGGERING WE'RE TALKING ABOUTHUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF WITNESSES FORTY TO FORTY FIVE YEARS OF INVESTIGATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ELEVEN COUNTIES WHICH MAKES UP A JUST AMONG THE THE COUNTIES THAT COULD BE INVOLVED -- POTENTIALLY I THINK -- ALMOST A THIRD OF THE STATE -- IT IT THE ALLEGED THE ALLEGATIONS TOUCH THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. THEY TOUCH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA LARGE PORTIONS THERE. AND THEY TOUCH THE CENTRAL VALLEY SACRAMENTO DOWN TO TULARE. SO WHICH SHOULD BE HUGE EXPANSE HUGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA A HUGE -- A TIME PERIOD AND A HUGE NUMBER OF OF POTENTIAL WITNESSES. ESTIMATES EARLY ON AND I AM I OR WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET THE EARLY ESTIMATES ARE THAT THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE MAY BE GIVEN. COULD NUMBER -- OVER A MILLION PAGES WHICH IF YOU SAT DOWN JUST WITH YOUR PHONE AND THE CALCULATOR FUNCTION YOU'LL FIND THAT FOR ANY ONE OF US TO TRY AND READ THAT. WOULD BE MANY YEARS OF OUR LIVES. AND SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE NORMAL KIND OF CASE. WHERE WE CAN HANDLE THAT -- WITHIN OUR BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. WERE LOOKING AND AMIN AS DEFENSE LAWYERS WERE FACING A TEAM OF POTENTIALLY OVER THIRTY PROSECUTORS OR THIRTY PEOPLE FROM THE PROSECUTION. WE'RE NOT BILL FOR THAT. I ASK THAT YOU GIVE FAIR CONSIDERATION AND SUPPORT THE BILL THAT -- SEKHEMRE COUNTY HAS -- PUT FORTH IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ON THE EDGE OF THE THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. CHRISLEY AND COMPANY CITIES ASSOCIATION -- JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT.

SECOND. CARE MOST A SECOND JUST REAL QUICKLY. HOW CLOSE IS AS THIS INVESTIGATION? COAST COMPLETED. STEVE KERR'S HER DRESSING UP TO ME -- MY EVER WILL ENSURE ONLINE I I'LL GIVE YOU I THINK I CAN GIVE YOU A FAIR ANSWER SO. I BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER TWO IN THE SACRAMENTO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WAS ONCE ASKED THE QUESTION. AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ABOUT THAT IT AND THE ANSWER WAS SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CASE FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS -- THE DEFENSE NEED SOME TIME TO CATCH UP -- AND YOUR WILL OUR INVESTIGATION WILL BE INDEPENDENT OF WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT US AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS DONE AT THIS POINT. AND I'VE GOT PEOPLE WORKING FULL TIME ON THIS SO MY QUESTION TO YOU WOULD BE DO YOU HAVE ANY. ACTION OF HOW LONG IS THAT WE TALK AND MANY MANY MORE YEARS BEFORE THAT YOU'RE PREPARED TO GO TO TRIAL. WELL I EIGHT IT'S DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THAT -- I I ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WE WILL DO WE WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS CASE -- PROFESSIONALLY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY BUT WITHOUT THE RESOURCES THAT'S NOT LIKELY THE WHO WITH RESOURCES LET'S SEE GET RESOURCES. AS OR ANY KIND OF FINITE ANSWER YOU CAN GIVE TO THIS CASE. WHAT WITHOUT HAVING OPTED REDISCOVERY WHICH WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO DO? I CAN'T ANSWER THAT BUT IT ILL. THESE CASES ARE NOT SHORT THEIR DIFFICULT CASES THEY'RE HARD CASES PEOPLE WHO WORK UNDERSTATEMENT ON THE YEAH PEOPLE GET SICK WORKING ON THESE CASES SO -- THESE ARE -- REAL -- STRUGGLE SO WE HAVE I'M NOT TRYING TO AVOID YOUR QUESTION I'M JUST I'M NOT TRYING TO GIVE AN ANSWER WHICH IS -- FAULTS PRECISION -- ENOUGH. AND JUST TO DECLARE FOR THE INVESTIGATION DOESN'T STOP. AT THE FILING OF CHARGES THE THE THE INVESTIGATION FOR PURPOSES OF PROSECUTING THE CHARGES THAT ARE ENUMERATED IN. HIS IN THE CURRENT CHARGING DOCUMENT ARE OBVIOUSLY SUFFICIENT FOR PROCEEDING TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THIS POINT. BUT JUST GIVEN THE SHEER VOLUME AMOUNT OF TIME OVER WHICH THESE CRIMES OCCURRED THEY'RE ALWAYS BE REMAINING INVESTIGATION TO BE DONE BUT FOR PURPOSES OF OF OF GETTING THE CASE MOVING -- THE THE THE FILING THE CHARGES HAS SIGNIFIED THAT IT IS COMPLETE TO THOSE POINTS BUT JUST THE IDEA THAT THE INVESTIGATION NEVER REALLY STOPS JUST BASED ON THE SHEER AMOUNT OF TIME IN VOLUME OF OF CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED. CAN OF THANK YOU. READY CALL FOR THE QUESTION. I GUESS YOU TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO CLOSER PLEASE THANK YOU -- IS ESTIMATED AT THE TRIAL EXCEED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. AB ONE FORTY ONE WELL ESTABLISHED MECHANISM IN WHICH THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND IS RETURNS OFFICE AS THE AFFECTED COUNTIES WILL BE ABLE TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXTRAORDINARY COSTS.

AND THE COUPLE THAT WAS KILL THE AIRFORCE THURMOND WAS ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF FROM MY HOUSE WE DOCTOR WILL THAT NIGHT. IT WAS HOT IN SUMMER AND NOBODY WENT OUT FEAR GRIPPED THE SECOND REGION. UNBELIEVABLE -- AT HIS DELIVERY I THINK BEING. VERY CAUTIOUS BUT A HIGH PROFILE MURDER CASES SOMETIMES IT MIGHT BE TWO THREE YEARS BEFORE IT GOES TO TRIAL. THAT'S A REAL LOOKING AT JUST THE THE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE. IT'S ASTRONOMICAL THIS IS REALLY THE BIGGEST CASE IN THIS TO THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND PROBABLY THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS JUST ONE SUSPECT.

AB FIFTEEN FIFTEEN ASSIST THE COMMUNITY PLAN UPDATE PROCESS AND PROVIDES CLARITY TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RESIDENTS AND DEVELOPERS ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT AN UPDATE A COMMUNITY PLAN IT SHOULD SERVE OUR MIDDLE DOCUMENT BE CHALLENGED IN COURT. WHILE MOST JURISDICTIONS UPDATE THE LAND USE ELEMENT OF THEIR GENERAL PLAN AS PART OF THEIR GENERAL PLAN UPDATE THOSE WITH MULTIPLE COMMUNITY PLAN AREAS UPDATE THESE DOCUMENTS INDIVIDUALLY. FROM QUERY COMMUNITY PLANS TO REVIEW BE REVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY SO WE SEEM AN CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES THEY DO COMMUNITY PLAN KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD BY NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SOME OF THESE JURISDICTIONS WITH MULTIPLE COMMUNITY PLANS THE PLANTS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED IN RECENT YEARS TO REFLECT CHANGING LOCAL PRIORITIES AS WELL AS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HOUSING. ABILITY AIR QUALITY INCREASING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED EXCEPT HER. FOR EXAMPLE IN LA THERE AND LAND USE ELEMENT IS COMPRISED OF THIRTY FIVE COMMUNITY PLANTS THAT CONTAIN GUIDING GOALS AND PRINCIPLES FOR HOW EACH PLANT AREA SHOULD GROW SOME OF THESE PLANS ARE CURRENTLY OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD. AND THEY BECOME A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE OBSTACLE TO BUILDING NEW HOUSING ONE SIGNIFICAN UPDATE UPS UPDATING THESE PLANS IS THE UNCERTAINTY THAT RESULTS IF THE E. I. ARE. PREPARED FOR THE COMMUNITY PLAN UPDATE IS CHALLENGED IN COURT. DURING THE LITIGATION PROCESS IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE ORIGINAL COMMUNITY PLAN OR THE UPDATE WILL BE IN EFFECT CAUSING DEVELOPER SOME PLANNERS GREAT UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIALLY DELAYING ALL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY PLAN AREA. AND AFFECTING THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN NEEDED HOUSING INTENDED BY THE COMMUNITY PLAN UPDATE. UNDER AB FIFTEEN FIFTEEN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED -- DEEMED A PRIOR DEEMED COMPLETE A COMPLETE PRIOR TO RECORD ISSUED RICHER RESCIND AVOID UPDATED COMMUNITY PLANS CANNOT BE INVALIDATED BY THE COURT. AB FIFTEEN IS NARROWLY TAILORED AND MAINTAINS ALL THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SEEK WERE TO DISCLOSE ALL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPDATE UPDATED COMMUNITY PLAN. AND DOES NOT PROHIBIT A PLANTS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FROM BEING CHALLENGED. FINALLY AB FIFTEEN FIFTEEN WOULD ONLY APPLY TO COMMUNITY PLANS OF ALREADY MET A HIGH SAID OF SPECIFIC CRITERIA. AIMED AT ADVANCING LOCAL AND STATE PRIORITY INCLUDING HOUSING AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WITH ME TODAY IS NICHOLAS MAYOR SOCIAL WITH THE CITY OF LA TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTEEN FIFTEEN WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME'S NICK MARISSA CHIN I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN FIFTEEN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. AS THE SOMEONE EVER SAID IN LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY PLANS ARE THE PARCEL BY PARCEL BLUEPRINT FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IN OUR CITY. DESIGNATING LAND FOR A VARIETY OF USES AND INTENSITIES. THE MAYOR HAS COMMITTED TO HAVING ALL THIRTY FIVE OUR COMMUNITY PLANS UP TO DATE BY. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND WE ARE COMMITTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOUR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO FIND THESE EFFORTS. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR COMMUNITY PLAN STAFFING FROM ABOUT A DOZEN JUST A FEW YEARS AGO TO OVER SEVENTY STAFF NOW SO WE ARE PUTTING TREMENDOUS RESOURCES INTO THIS EFFORT. AS PART OF THE UPDATE PROCESS WE'RE WORKING TO ALIGN THE LAND USE POLICIES IN OUR COMMUNITY PLANS WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOALS. THAT SUPPORT BOTH INCREASED HOUSING PRODUCTION AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVELY UPDATING SIXTEEN COMMUNITY PLANS I HAVING COMPLETED OUR SIX ALREADY. AND THE CITY HAS EXPERIENCED UNCERTAINTY IN THE PAST WITH RESPECT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF ADOPTED LAND USE PLANS WHEN THEY ARE SUBJECT TO A SECRET CHALLENGE. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE CLARITY ON HOW TO YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTATION DURING THAT PERIOD. CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN DO GREAT PLANNING TO INCREASE CAPACITY FOR HOUSING IN THEIR LAND USE PLANS. BUT IF WE ARE PREVENTED FROM IMPLEMENTING THE PLANS DUE TO LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES WE CAN EXPERIENCE YEARS OF DELAY BEFORE THE ADDITIONAL HOUSING CAPACITY IS REALIZED. THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION REMOVES THAT AMBIGUITY HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROPERTY OWNERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PLANS MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE EVENT OF A CHALLENGE. THE BILL WILL ENCOURAGE JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE TO MAXIMIZE THEIR EFFORTS TO ADOPT LOCAL LAND USE PLANS THAT INCREASE HOUSING CAPACITY. AND OPPORTUNITIES HOUSING CAPACITY IN HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN A COMMUNITY LIKE CONTACTS FOR THESE REASONS. GARCETTI SUPPORTS AND SPONSORS AB FIFTEEN FIFTEEN AND WE THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO ACT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

FIVE ZERO EIGHT ON TO DELIVER SAVE WATER TO SMALL COMMUNITIES WHO RELY ON DOMESTIC WELLS AND SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. THE BILL AB DID THIS BILL BUILT ON CALIFORNIA. ONGOING EFFORT TO PROVIDE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE BILL REQUIRES THAT DURING PUBLIC ALL RICH AND CONSIDERATION OF CONSOLIDATION OR EXTENSION OF SERVICES. THE WATER BORE INFORMED RESIDENTS IF THE OWNER OF TO DOMESTIC WELL OR DWELLING IS WITHHOLDING CONSENT. TO THE STATE FUNDED CONSOLIDATION OR EXPANSION OF SERVICES. COMING HERE A MEMBER REMOVED A SECTION OF TO BUILD THAT PROHIBIT RECEIVING WATER SYSTEM. FROM ILLEGALLY CHARGING THE STATE FEE OF FEED I MEANT FOR THE NEW DEVELOPMENT WHAT PROJECT ARE MEANT TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO THE EXISTING COMMITTEE. A LAST WEEK -- I MY OFFICE IS IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS HE IS THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCY. WERE WORKING ON NARAL INTO SECTION. AND TO ENSURE THERE WOULD BE NO AND INTEND THE CONSEQUENCES. OF AND SO WE HAVE -- CAME UP WITH THIS AGREEMENT. AND AND A MEMBER BUT DUE TO THE TIME CRUNCH WELL -- WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT TAKE BILLS AS COMEDIA MEMON TODAY. BUT I WOULD TAKING THOSE TO AGREED UPON IN NAM AND AS ALSO THERE'S A MA'AM AND YOU FLY BILL MAKE IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. I'M FINE THIS WILL MAKE SURE THOSE FEES TO NOT TAKE AWAY. THE STATE RESOURCES THAT COULD GO DIRECTLY INTO PROVIDING CLEAN DRINKING WATER OR RACE THE CALLED COST OF PROJECT TOO HIGH FOR THE STATETO PRESERVE. TO PURSUE. AB FIVE ZERO A IS SPONSORED BY THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE. POLICY LINK CLEAN WATER ACTION COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND DAUGHTERS. WAS ME TODAY ARE -- MICHAEL CLEAR BORN FUND LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND AYE RICKY DS -- RULE UP IN -- CALL OF CON CONTRA CREEK. CALIFORNIA TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WE CAN HOOK MY NAME IS MY CLAIBORNE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I'D LIKE TO START BY. THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR CONTINUING TO CHAMPION EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THE STATE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AND REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON DRAFT. AMENDMENTS REGARDING CAPACITY CHARGE PROVISION WHICH HAS BEEN REMOVED IN THE AMENDMENTS AS WAS JUST EXPLAINED -- THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT DATE HAVE APPEARED TO HAVE ARRIVED AT A RESOLUTION THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS BUT AS WAS EXPLAINED -- TOO LATE FOR TODAY'S HEARING -- TURNING TO THE NEED FOR THE BILL THERE IS A DRINKING WATER CRAZY CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE LACK ACCESS TO DREDGE SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THEIR HOMES. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS CRISIS INVOLVES THOSE RELIANT ON DOMESTIC WELLS -- WHICH PROVIDE DRINKING WATER TO NEARLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE. PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS SPURRED BY THE PASSAGE OF SB EIGHTY EIGHT AND AB TWENTY FIVE OH ONE LAST YEAR. WHICH GRANTED THAT STATE WATER BOARD AUTHORITY TO MANDATE -- DRINKING WATER SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION AS WELL AS EXTENSION OF DRINKING WATER SERVICE. HOWEVER THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN WHICH AB FIVE AWAIT WILL MAKE THE MANDATORY CONSOLIDATION AND EXTENSION OF SERVICE PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT AND TRANSPARENT. AN EXAMPLE FOR THE NEED OF THE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS PROVIDED BY THE BILL IS PROVIDED BY TOMBSTONE TERRITORY WHICH IS A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND FRESNO COUNTY. WITH THIRTY NINE HOME SERVED BY DOMESTIC WELLS -- WHICH CAM AND CONTAMINATED WITH TWENTY THREE T. C. P. N. NITRATES LIKE CAMINO MANY COMMUNITIES THAT LACK ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER TOMBSTONE IS LESS THAN A MILE. FROM THE CITY OF SINGER WHICH PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER THROUGH A PUBLIC SYSTEM. HOWEVER THE WAY THAT THE RELEVANT STATUTE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN THE STATE WATER BOARD MUST OBTAIN WRITTEN CONSENT FROM OWNERS OF HOUSEHOLDS SERVED BY DOMESTIC WELLS. BEFORE IT COMPLETES A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS -- THIS BILL WOULD MOVE THAT PROCESS CHANGE THAT PROCESS SO WRITTEN CONSENT IS CONSIDERED WHEN THE FIT IF HE'S ABILITY -- AND ALICE THIS IS COMPLETED. AND THE IDEA BEHIND THAT CHANGES THAT IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT WHEN WE'RE WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES TO GET CONSENT -- WHILE THE DETAILS OF THE PROJECT ARE UNKNOWN PRIOR TO A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS. SO. THE BILL WOULD MOVE THAT PROCESS SORT OF AND ANALYZING CONSENT DOWN TO LATER IN THE PROCESS AND HOPEFULLY BUILD MORE SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN THE SECOND THING THE BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE BOARD TO NOTIFY BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND CURRENT. OCCUPANTS OF DWELLINGS WITHIN A COMMUNITY SURVIVE FAILING DOMESTIC WELLS -- OF THE WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS OF THE POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACTS AND THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL SOLUTION HERE AN EXTENSION OF DRINKING WATER SERVICE. AND HOLD THE BILL WOULD MAKE THE PROCESS FOR EXTENSION OF DRINKING WATER CITY SERVICE MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE TRANSPARENT AND CONTINUE THE RECENT PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THAT COMMITTEE SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

AND I RECEIVED NUMEROUS SUPPORT LETTERS REGARDING THIS AS WELL. SO GO AHEAD AND START THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE TRANSPORTATION QUARTER AGENCIES TCA WAS FORMED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AS A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY BY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE IN SEVERAL CITIES FOLLOWING PLANNING THAT BEGAN. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IDENTIFYING THE NEED FOR NEW HIGHWAYS. IN THE MID EIGHTIES TWO BILLS WERE PASSED OFF THREE AUTHORIZING THE JPA TO COLLECT TOLLS AND OPPOSE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES. FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIFFERING AND THE ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED COST OF CONSTRUCTING ROADS THE AUTHORIZATION TO COLLECT TOLLS WAS RELYING SOLELY UPON A FINDING THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER ADEQUATE FUNDING AVAILABLE FROM ANY FEDERAL STATE. OR OTHER SOURCE THE JPA COULD TOLL ROADS THAN TO PAY OFF THE DEBT AND ONE BILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG. THE LEGISLATION ENVISIONS THE ROADS UPON REPAYMENT WILL BECOME PUBLIC TO BE USED AS FREE LOADS LIKE INTERSTATE. FIVE THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY WHEN OPENED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE SYSTEM COSTS WAS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR BILLION. AND FINAL ACTUAL INITIAL COST OF THE ROADS WERE MISSED BY SOME THREE POINT TWO BILLION OR ABOUT THE CURRENT PLAN HAS EXTENDED DEBT AN INCREASE TOLLS AT LEAST TWELVE TIMES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX TO PAY OFF THAT THEN FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEBT WHICH IS NOW SIX POINT FOUR BILLION. AND UNDER THE CURRENT DEBT STRUCTURE IS ESTIMATED TO TOTAL ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS T. C. A.. T. C. A. WOULD HAVE THAT EQUAL TO THE STATES OF MONTANAUTAH WYOMING IDAHO AND NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA. THE TOLL ROADS HAVE BEEN COLLECTING TOLLS ON THESE QUARTER SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND WILL CONTINUE TO DOES DO SO UNTIL TWENTY FIFTY AND TWENTY FIFTY THREE WELL BEYOND THE ORIGINAL ANTICIPATED DATE OF TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE SYSTEM WAS CREATED DUE TO A LACK OF TRANSPORTATION. FUNDINGNOW ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS PAY FOUR TIMES FOR ROADS WE PAY OUR NORMAL TAXES WE PAY MEASURE IN TWO WHICH IS A HALF COW I HAVE SENT SALES TAX. IMPOSED BY THE COUNTY WE HAVE SB ONE GAS TAXTWELVE CENTS ON GAS TWENTY CENTS ON DIESEL INCREASE ROSA FOR REGISTRATION FEES. AND WE HAVE TO PAY TO DRIVE ON THE TOLL ROADS RATHER THAN BEING A TOLL ROAD OPERATOR WHICH IS THEIR CORE MISSION THE TCA HAS BECOME A PLANNING AGENCY. THAT IS OPERATING OUTSIDE OF THEIR LANE SO TO SPEAK. PCA'S PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT ORTIZ DUPLICATIVE AND REDUNDANT ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY SERVES AS THE COUNTY'S TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION UNDER STATE LAW WHICH GIVES OC TAE THE POWER PLANT DESIGN CONSTRUCTION OPERATE HIGHWAYS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND CITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY THESE THREE DOESN'T SEIZE AND INCONSISTENCIES HARM REGIONAL PLANNING TO STABILIZE REAL ESTATE MARKETS. IN DANGER SCHOOLS THREATEN OPEN SPACE AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES THE MAN SET ASIDE BY DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL AGENCIES AS PUBLIC AMENITIES LAST YEAR AB THREE EIGHTY TWO WAS HEARD IN THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. THE THEME THE CHAIR KEPT REITERATING WAS THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEAR DELINEATION WHO THE PLANNING AUTHORITY IS IN ORANGE COUNTY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE IS CLEAR THE PLANNING AUTHORITY IS THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. THE OTHER STORE OVER HALF CENT SALES TAX MEASURE IN TWO THAT IS DONE. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PROJECTS IN ORANGE COUNTY AFFORDABILITY IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE HERE. FEES PAID TO THE TOLL ROADS ARE HIGH NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION INCLUDES A DEVELOPER FEE FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES FROM FOUR THOUSAND ONE OR TWENTY SIX DOLLARS 250-007-0090 SEVEN DOLLARS. THESE FEES STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AT THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THERE'S A COMMUNITY CALLED RANCHO MISSION VIEJO THAT'S CONSTRUCTING FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND THEY'RE PAYING AN ESTIMATED HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE TCA AND THESE ARE ULTIMATELY FEES ARE PASSED ON TO THE NEW HOMEOWNERS. BUSINESSES GET HIT EVEN HARDER WITH FEES RANGING FROM TWO DOLLARS TO EIGHT DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT THESE P. THESE FEES ARE ALL PAID BAR HOMES AND BUSINESSES. AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS FOR A ROAD IN MY OPINION THAT WILL NEVER BE BILL MY BILL TWELVE SEVENTY THREE REMOVES THEIR PLANNING AUTHORITY AND STOPS I'M FROM ACCUMULATING ADDITIONAL DEBT. THE TOLL ROAD CAN STILL BE BUILT IF IT'S APPROVED THROUGH THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY WHICH IS OUR COUNTY PLANNING AUTHORITY. THE TOLL ROADS REBUILDING TENNEY OPERATE ON THE BACKS OF OUR HOMEOWNERS BUSINESSES AND TOLL COLLECTION. MY BILLS INTENT IS RETURN THE TCA TO ITS CORE MISSION AS A TOLL ROAD OPERATOR PAY OFF THE BONDS AND THEN TURN THE ROADS OVER THE PEOPLE AS FREE. WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS THE MAYOR PRO TEM OF THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE THE HONORABLE DAMPING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. TWELVE SEVENTY THREE ASSEMBLYMAN BRO SAID MY NAME IS DAN BAIN I AM ALSO THE CITY SANTA MAYES REPRESENTATIVE. ON THE SAN JOAQUIN HILLS TRANSPORTATION QUARTER AGENCY BOARD WHICH IS ONE OF THE TWO AGENCIES THAT MAKE UP THE TCA. BUT TO BE CLEAR I'M APPEARING TODAY NOT IN THAT CAPACITY THIS ALWAYS MY CAPACITY IS THE MAYOR PRO TEM SAN CLEMENTE. SIMPLY PUT THE TCA IS AN AGENCY THAT'S OUT OF ITS LAND AND OPERATING FAR FIELD OF ITS LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY. ANOTHER TO SOME WOMEN BROKE PASSED AROUND A LETTER THAT WAS SENT BY A CONGRESSMAN LEVIN AND ROWDY YESTERDAY. AND IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH A HIGHLIGHT THAT UNFORTUNATELY THE TCA IS ACTED BEYOND THE SCOPE OF ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. AND BEGUN PLANNING NEW ROUTES THAT PASSED THROUGH SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO IN SANTA MANY THAT ARE INCONSISTENT. WITH THE STATUTORY DEFINITION IN MANDATE ABOUT SORT TO FORTY ONE THAT WERE ESTABLISHED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. THE T. C. WAS INITIALLY FORMED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IT WAS A NOVEL IDEA THAT WORK FOR A TIME. THE P. C. WAS ABLE TO BILL FIFTY ONE MILES OF ROADS WITH THAT WORK BEING COMPLETED ACCORDING TO THE T. C. IS ON WEBSITE IN. NINETEEN NINETY NINE SINCE THAT SINCE THAT TIME THE TEASE THE TCA HAS NOT BILL ONE INCH OF NEW ROAD OR HIGHWAY. HOWEVER THE TWENTY YEARS THE T. C. HAS ACCOMPLISHED THE FOLLOWING. THEY'VE ENGAGED IN A TWENTY YEAR FIGHT WITH ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ATTEMPTING TO BUILD AN UNNECESSARY TOLL ROAD TO THE STATE PARK IN HABITAT RESERVE. THEY'VE COLLECTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES THAT INCREASE THE PRICE. OF EVERY NEW HOME AND BUSINESS BUILT IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY BY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. IT'S INCREASE THE TO DAD BY OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A TOTAL DEBT OF MORE THAN SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. SPEND TENS OF MILLIONS ON CONSULTANTS AND LOBBYISTS TRY TO FORCE. FOR FORCE BUILD -- TO BUILD A TOLL ROAD THAT NO SINGLE STATE TO DATE HAS SHOWN IS NECESSARY. AND DEFERRED ONE POINT TWO BILLION AND APPROVE ROAD WHITING'S THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLETED BY. TWENTY TWENTY TO PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS AND PROJECTS PLANNED FOR DECADES THIS LEGISLATURE'S BEEN ATTEMPTING TO FIX THE TCA SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES OF LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS EVERY FEW YEARS. THERE'S A REASON WHY WE KEEP COMING BACK TO SAY SACRAMENTO THE TCA ISN'T CAPABLE OF FIXING ITSELF. ONE EXAMPLE THE T. C. IS MISMANAGING WAS SEEN AT THE RECENT IN THE RECENT LOS ANGELES TIMES ARTICLE. WEISS IN TRAFFIC THESE TOLLWAY CONSULTANTS CHARGE THE PUBLIC A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR READING THE NEWS. WE CAN FRONT OF THIS INFORMATION TO YOU SEE AT DC STAFF ATTENDED THEIR OWN INTERNAL AUDIT. WHICH HE SAID -- THESE CONSOLES MORE MONEY FOR UNDER BILLING. WHEN CONFRONTED BY THIS AT A RECENT BOARD MEETING TO SEE STAFF SAID THEY ALREADY HIRED AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT WITHOUT BOARD APPROVAL? BUT DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO DO A FRIENDS GOT IT TO SEE IF THEY REALLY SPENT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SEVEN THOUSAND FACEBOOK FRIENDS -- IF CONSULTANTS REALLY SPENT ELEVEN HOURS A DAY. READING THE NEWS THE TCA AT STAFF CONSOLE AND SO PERHAPS ANOTHER BOARD MEMBERS WILL SAY THIS SHOULD BE A MATTER OF LOCAL CONTROL AT THE CITY'S ST COMPANIES HERE. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO TOLL ROAD THERE ARE OPEN SPACE. THAT'S THE MINISTRY AS FAR AS IT GOES. THE T. C. HAS REFUSED AS THE LOCAL CONTROL TO PROTECT OUR MILES OF PROTECTED OPEN SPACE FOR TOLL ROAD. THE NOT AGAIN NOT ONCE THAT IS SHOWN AS NECESSARY BUT SO LONG AS THEY KEEP STUDYING AND STUDYING. A SOURCE HANGING OVER THE HEADS OF OUR CITY. IS TAKEN POLITICAL COURAGE FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER BROUGHT INTRODUCED THIS BILL. AND TO FIGHT FOR THE RESIDENTS OF HIS DISTRICT IT IS TAKING COURAGE FOR HIM TO RESIST THE ORANGE COUNTY POLITICAL CONSULTANTS AND LOBBYIST. WITH PUSH HARD TO KEEP THE STATUS QUO GOING SO LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO PROFIT. LOOKING AT THE LIST OF OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IT APPEARS IN ALMOST EACH ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT I SEE. ARE PAID CONSULTANTS OR VENN DOORS FOR THE TCA -- RECEIVING SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL COMPENSATION ONE FORMER ANOTHER FROM THE TCR ITS CONSULTANTS. IT'S CLEAR BY SO MANY DON'T WANT THINGS TO CHANGE IN A MATTER HOW OUT OF CONTROL HAS BECOME. AND I THINK AS AS CONGRESSMAN LEVIN AND AND ROUTE AS LETTER SHOWS THIS IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO THE SAME FROM THE COMMITTEE ON OR MY COMMITTEE WENT TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. HOWEVER OTHER OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. ONE OF THE HUMANA [inaudible] MANAGER. MADAM CHAIR -- RICHARD HARRIS OF THE NORSEMAN FIRM ON BM BEHALF FOR THE TRANSPORTATION QUARTER AGENCIES ORANGE COUNTY. WHICH ARE ACTUALLY THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND SUCCESSFUL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES IN THE STATE. WITH A TRACK RECORD TO PROVE THAT. THE T. C. A.'S BILL FIFTY ONE MILES OF STATE HIGHWAYS WITHOUT TAXPAYER FINANCING. IT'S ROUGHLY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF STATE INFRASTRUCTURE WAS FINANCED WITH TAX EXEMPT NON RECOURSE TOLL REVENUE BONDS. THERE'S OVER THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND TRIPS A DAY TAKEN ON THE TOLL ROADS. AND THEY HAVE OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ACCOUNT HOLDERS. THIS IS NOT AN AGENCY OUT OF CONTROL. THIS IS AN AGENCY THAT WORKS HAS A TRACK RECORD. AND IS DOING A GREAT JOB. LET'S SET THE RECORD STATE STRAIGHT. FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE BEEN PRESENTED WITH. NAY AGENCIES I'M NEVER DEFAULTED ON ANY DEBT OBLIGATION AND THEY'VE NEVER MISSED ANY PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. THE CREDIT INVESTMENT GRADE. IS THE CREDIT RATING IS INVESTMENT GRADE WITH AN A MINUS RATING BY STANDARD AND POOR'S THIS IS. AN INVESTMENT GRADE RATING DETERMINED BY THIS AGENCIES MANAGEMENT. YOU KNOW BASED ON HOW GOOD OF MANAGEMENT THEY DO. AND THE FACT THEY DON'T RECEIVE ANY OTHER STATE [inaudible] CONTRIBUTIONS. FROM OTHER FROM STATE AGENCIES SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE ALL THE OTHER TOLL AGENCIES IN THE AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND YET THEY HAVE RECEIVED THIS INVESTMENT GRADE RATING. AB. TWELVE SEVENTY THREE WAS INTRODUCED INTERFERE WITH THE ONGOING SEQUEL -- REVIEW PROCESS LED NOW BY CALTRANS. THEY WANT TO INTERFERE BY REMOVING CHEESY A WHICH IS THE SPONSORING AGENCY WHICH IS DOING THE PLANNING AND PROVIDING THE FUNDING FOR WHATEVER ALTERNATIVES. OUTS PROJECTS ARE SELECTED TO IMPROVE SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY TRAFFIC. IT'S A CLEAR. THE END AROUND OF SEQUEL. CONTRARY TO THE AUTHOR'S ASSERTIONS THE TCA STATUTORY AUTHORITY ITS CORE MISSION. UNDER THE J. P. A LAW AS CITED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WE'VE SEEN WE'VE GOT THE STATUS OF THE STATURE NUMBERS. THEIR STATUTORY AUTHORITY IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PLANNING FINANCING CONSTRUCTING MAINTAINING MANAGING AN OPERATING MAJOR THOROUGHFARES AND BRIDGES IN ORANGE COUNTY. THAT IS NOT AT ODDS WITH THE ROLE OF THE OTHER TRANSPORTATION AGENCY IN THE COUNTY AND IN FACT. AND CONTRARY TO THEIR ASSERTIONS. ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND THE TCA HAVE WORKED TOGETHER AND THEY WORK TOGETHER ALL THE TIME HAND AND LOVE. THE LAST TWO DECADES ALONE TCA BUILT. AND FUNDED FINANCED AND BUILT SEVENTEEN LOCAL TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS IN COORDINATION WITH THOSE HE TA. AND CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW AS WE SIT HERE. THERE FUNDING TOLL REVENUES WITH TOLL REVENUES AND DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEET CREDITS. WHAT'S THE AUTHOR CLAIMS ARE MISS MANAGE SOMEHOW THAT THAT MONEY WHAT THE THAT IS FUNDING ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS RIGHT NOW. INCLUDING THOSE SO BRIDGE AND THE LOS PAJAMAS PARKWAY. SO BESIDES OBVIOUS TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS ON TRANSPORTATION I THINK YOU'RE COMMITTEE DID A GREAT JOB OF POINTING OUT. THE ANALYSIS -- IN THE ROLE OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS THE LOOK AT GOVERNMENT'S YOU ON THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES NEITHER CALTRANS IN ORANGE COUNTY. HAVE THE FINANCES AVAILABLE TO COMPLETE ORANGE COUNTY'S STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. DON'T FORGET THESE ARE STATE HIGHWAYS THEY WERE ALWAYS ON THE ARTERIAL MAP THERE WAS NO FINANCING FOR IT MISTER BROLL. ALLUDED TO IT LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUSINESS LEADERS CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE TO GET THE AUTHORITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN DESTINIES. AND OUT OF THAT THE T. C. A.'S JPA WAS CREATED. FOR JP AS TWO SEPARATE ONES ONE MANAGEMENT AND THEY ARE NOW MODELS OF LOCAL DECISION MAKING. THERE'S EIGHTEEN CITIES AND THREE COUNTY SUPERVISORS THAT ARE REPRESENTED ON THESE THESE BOARDS THIS IS LOCAL DECISION MAKING AT ITS BEST WHAT WE HAVE THOUGH. IS ONE CITY THAT HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE ONGOING SEQUEL PLANNING PROCESS. AS DECIDED TO COME TO SACRAMENTO OF FALSEHOODS DISTORTIONS A PAID POLITICAL CAMPAIGN GOING AFTER THE PEOPLE THAT SERVE ON THESE BOARDS IN THESE OTHER CITIES. AND TURN ALL OF THAT INTO A SACRAMENTO PROBLEM. FRANKLY IT'S NOT A SACRAMENTO PROBLEM THERE THIS IS JUST A LOCAL. INTERFERENCE IN SEQUENCE. THE TCL LOOKS FORWARD TO SITTING DOWN WITH ASSEMBLYMAN BRO. THE LOCAL LEADERS WILL CORRECT THE RECORD WORK WITH PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL PLANNING DISCUSSIONS UNDER SEE WHAT. THAT HOPEFULLY FIND THE BEST ALTERNATIVES TO ADDRESS LOCAL TRAFFIC RELIEF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TRACY VERDA TOURISM HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IN OPPOSITION. CHAU MCREYNOLDS TOWNS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS I REPRESENTING CITIES OF PLACENTIA SANTA ANA FULLER TEN IN MISSION VIEJO IN OPPOSITION. WE WERE TOP ON BEHALF ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE DO THE THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I AM -- ONE IT ALLUDES TO ONE OF THE LETTERS HERE THAT THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT? IS THE COMMUNITY THINK THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TRANSPARENT PROCESS IT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH THE THE T. C. A. N. [inaudible] AND SO. I MEAN I DO THIS IS A LOCAL ISSUE. TO ME IT'S NO DOUBT ABOUT. BUT NOT TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER FIGURE THE CELLS DRIVE ME NUTS BUT STRIVE IN THE NOTES. TO SO HELP ME WALK ME THROUGH THIS A LITTLE BIT. SO. WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IS. THERE WAS A ROAD THAT WAS PLANNED AND WE ALL SUPPORTED CALLED THE GREAT ALIGNMENT IT WAS TO FINISH THE TWO FORTY ONE SOUTH OF SAN CLEMENTE. NORTH THE CAMP PENDLETON WE ALSO PORTED AT THE TCA ONE FROM THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL WATER QUALITY BOARD. COULDN'T GET IT APPROVED THEY APPEAL TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION. THEY GOT DENIED THE APPEAL TO THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S DEPARTMENT COMMERCE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THEY GOT TONIGHT. SO. FORCED WITH NO APPROVALS THEY ENTERED INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE TO TAKE THAT OFF THE TABLE AND NOW IT'S OUT OF THE SKAGGS FIFTY YEAR REGIONAL REGIONAL PLAN. SO NOW THE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY TURN TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE WHICH THEIR FAVORITE ROUTE IS TO COME DOWN RIGHT INTO SAN CLEMENTE HIGH SCHOOL ON PICO. AND YOU KNOW. THE OPPOSITION SAID THAT THIS IS ONE DISGRUNTLED CITY IT'S NOT IT'S FORMER CONGRESSMAN DARRELL ISA ITS CURRENT CONGRESSMAN MIKE LEVIN IT'S THE STATE SENATOR IT'S THE STATE ASSEMBLYMAN. TO DO NOT SUPPORT THIS AGENCY BUILDING AROUND THE CONNECTS THE FIVE SO IT'S NOT JUST ONE CITY AND ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE FIFTY FIFTY ON IT. BOARD MEMBERS ARE FIFTY FIFTY ON IT -- DOWN THERE SOMETHING. THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL SOMETHING TO DO DOING A GOOD THING AND I ULTIMATELY THESE ARE STATE ROADS. SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS IN THE EIGHTIES THERE WAS NO MONEY AVAILABLE. THE STATE ALLOWED THEM TO CREATE THESE ROAD OPERATE AND PAY OFF THE BONDS OF TURN OF THE PEOPLE FOR FREE SO THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IT IT IS A LOCAL ISSUE. BUT ULTIMATELY IT THESE ARE STATE ROADS AND THAT'S WHY THE STATE'S INVOLVED. IN THE OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PROJECTS. A YEAR AGO THEY TURNED OUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR TO ADD ADDITIONAL LANES BECAUSE THE RIDERSHIP IS NOT THERE. BUT THEY TALK ABOUT SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY ON THE SO PARKWAY. THEY AGAIN TRIED TO GET LOS PETRONIUS EXTENDED THEY GOT DENIED SO THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. AND THE THE RANCHO MISSION VIEJO COMPANY OR BUILDING THE ROAD THAT YES THEY ARE PAYING FOR IT BUT THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING APPROVED SO THAT'S PART OF THE PLANNING THING BECAUSE THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I CAN'T DO ANYTHING APPROVED. AND WITH THE TRACK RECORD LOS ETA MANAGING MOTHER MEASURE AM TO AND ACTUALLY BUILDING PROJECTS. WE FEEL THE PLANNING AUTHORITY SHOULD BE IN -- C. T.. AND TCA SHOULD JUST GET BACK TO THEIR CORE BUSINESS OF BEING A TOLL ROAD OPERATORS. ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SO A MISTER ROWE THERE'S OPTIONS HERE -- FOR ME I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU GUYS GO BACK AND I KNOW THIS THIS IS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUE -- YOU BRING IT TO THE SURFACE SO THAT ALL OF US CAN SEE HERE WHAT'S GOING ON AND I'D. PROPOSED THAT YOU SHOULD SHOW UP IN THE FALL AND WE RUN THIS IS A TO YOUR BILL. AND SEE WHERE YOU STAND AT THAT POINT THAT'S THE PLANET AS OF AS WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE. LAST WEEK I HAD TWO WEEKS A CONVERSATION WITH BOARD MEMBERS AND THE REASON I DID TESTIMONY ONLY AND THE REASON WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS A TO YOUR BILL IS BECAUSE THE BOARD MEMBERS. HAVE GIVEN ME THEIR COMMITMENT TO WORK ON THIS AND IN THE PAST SO FOR EXAMPLE THREE EIGHTY TWO IS RAN LAST YEAR SENATOR BATES AND I SAT DOWN WITH T. C. A. AND CTA. IN SEPTEMBER AFTER SESSIONS TODAY GUYS WHAT'S GOING ON NOTHING'S CHANGED SO THERE'S BEEN PROMISES AND COMMITMENTS MADE. BUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE LEAVING YOU WITH A LETTER OF FOR THINGS THAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH IS HERE. SO IF THEY DON'T HAPPEN IN THE AND THE PARTIES ARE DEALING IN GOOD FACE WE CAN COME BACK. AND CONSIDER WHETHER WE NEED ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION -- BUT I THINK THIS IS THE LEAST YOU HAVE A GOAL AND A PLAN AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE OUTCOME AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THIS CLEANED UP AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WE WON'T HAVE TO NEED. A RED BILL. IT'S A SHAME THAT A LITTLE TOO THERE WERE HERE AT THIS RIGHT ABSOLUTE AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAD TREPIDATIONS ABOUT DOING THIS IN THIS MANNER AND I THINK THIS LIST BROUGHT. IT TO THE SURFACE IN THE CONVERSATIONS I HOPE WILL. START OVER RIGHT IT'S CLEAR WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST THIS WORK ON THIS AGAIN. AND I HOPE THAT THIS COMES TO A A I OKAY A GREAT RESOLUTION AT THE END SO DO I OKAY AND I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR WORK AND YOUR HELP ON THIS. THIS PROCESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE VERY WELCOME THAT'S BEEN JOB. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MEMBERS. I'LL BE QUICK. YEAH I'D LIKE TO SEE A FOUR POINT.

BY ALLOWING THEM TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT. FROM THE CHRISTIAN STATE MANDATES AS IT RELATES TO DELAYS IN ADOPTING A STATE -- PROCESS SO FOR EXAMPLE THINGS LIKE HAVING A HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLIANCE THE HAS GO FOR STATE REVIEW THEIR INSTANCES WHERE THE STATE. FAILS TO MEET ITS OWN A STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS CAUSING A DELAY FOR CITIES CITIES ARE NOT ALL ARE ON EQUAL FOOTING. FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY ABOUT WATER IN MY DISTRICT HAS EIGHTY EMPLOYEES THAT -- DEAL WITH -- THE CITY BUDGET -- THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS THIRTY THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES YET BOTH CITIES ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERGO THE SAME -- REVIEW PROCESS -- BY THE STATE SO THIS WOULD IN THE CASE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ALLOW THEM TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT WHERE THAT DELAY CAUSES LOSS REVENUES FOR THOSE SMALL.

GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES AB ELEVEN WOULD RECREATE REDEVELOPMENT AS A TOOL TO FUND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WELL FORMER REDEVELOPMENT DEFINITELY HAD CHALLENGES WITH REGARDS TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THE STATE TO STOP INVESTING IN ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IN FUNDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THIS BILL WE DO NOT PROPOSE BRINGING BACK THE ECONOMIC INVESTMENTS FROM REDEVELOPMENT ONE POINT -- WERE ONLY FOCUSED ON HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE ON A SMALLER SCALE THAN FORMER REDEVELOPMENT. OUR BILL WOULD ALLOW CITIES AND COUNTIES TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE AGENCIES REQUIRED AT LEAST 30% OF THE MONIES. GENERATED IN PROJECT AREAS TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO AVOID THE ABUSES FROM THE PASTOR BILL HAS MANY SAFEGUARDS REQUIREMENTS OF DETAILED RECORDS AN INDEPENDENT AUDITS FINES FOR VIOLATIONS NEW GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS AND ROBUST REPLACEMENT AND ANTI DISPLACEMENT POLICIES. OR BILL DOES NOT IMPACT COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE KEPT HOLE THROUGH PASSED THROUGH PAYMENTS FROM CITIES. AND THE STATE WOULD BACK FILL THE SCHOOL PORTION OF REDEVELOPMENT KEEPING THEM WHOLE. THIS BILL IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO RE ESTABLISHING REDEVELOPMENT ON A LIMITED SCALE FOCUS ON OUR STATE'S CURRENT PRIORITIES AND WITH SIGNIFICANT STATE OVERSIGHT I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT. AND THANK THE TWELVE JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS BILL INCLUDING THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR WE MOVE THIS FORWARD AND HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. A POSITIVE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A OF OTHERS AND SUPPORT. REBEKAH MARQUEZ REPRESENTING LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS NONPROFIT PROVIDERS OF SENIOR CARE AND SERVICES. INCLUDING AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND MANAGERS COLLECTIVELY OUR MEMBERS SERVE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS ACROSS THE STATE. THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAS MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AD THE TRIP PARTICULARLY HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE TO THOSE WERE EXTREMELY LOW. AND VERY LOW INCOME THE STATE'S LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HIGHER COST OF LIVING HAS FORCED MANY OLDER ADULTS TO LIVE ON FIXED INCOMES. INTO POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS AS HOUSING COSTS RISE RETIREMENT INCOME SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY AND SSI HAVE REMAINED STAGNANT AND MANY LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS FIND AN IMPOSSIBLE PAID THEIR RENTS. MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA -- OLDER ADULTS LOS ANGELES COUNTY RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT WHILE THEIR OVERALL HOMELESS POPULATION WENT DOWN 4% IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PERSONS AGE SIXTY TWO AND OVER. INCREASED 22% IN THE SAME PERIOD THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN LEADING H. CALIFORNIA MEMBER AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITIES STATEWIDE IS UNDER FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. MOST OF THE BUILDINGS THAT SERVE THESE EXTREMELY AND VERY LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS WERE BUILT USING REDEVELOPMENT FUNDING. DESPITE NOBLE EFFORTS BY THE LEGISLATURE ON HOUSING ADVOCATES TO CREATE NEW SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FILL THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR HOLE LEFT. IN THE ABSENCE OF REDEVELOPMENT THE OLD REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM HAD ITS FLAWS BUT IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT THE PROGRAM WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AT PRODUCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AB ELEVEN SIX TO REIMAGINE WHAT WORKED FROM THE PRIOR REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WILL AIMING TO FIX WHAT DIDN'T WE APPLAUD ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIR WHEN HIS CO AUTHORS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND ARCHER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU -- YEAH ANY YOUR ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. STEVE ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THE ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONER ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. BIGELOW DELUCA HERE WE HAVE THE OAKLAND MAYOR SUPPORT THANK YOU. MARINO I OR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM SUPPORTING CONCEPT OF THE IDEA OF BRINGING BACK ANOTHER REDEVELOPMENT LIKE TOOL THANK YOU. LOOK OUT FOR WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA AND WE SUPPORTING CONCEPT THANK YOU. YOUR MEMBERS ROSS BUT THE ON BEHALF OF US TECHNO MEREKA STEINBERG WHO ALSO CHAIRS THE BIG CITY MAYORS CUSHION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU. TODD DAVID ON BEHALF THE BAY AREA HOUSING AFTER SEE COALITION IN SUPPORT. MAKING CELL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UP FOR OF ACTION IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN THANK YOU. TYRONE BUCKLEY HOUSING CALIFORNIA SPORT CONCEPT VERY PLEASED THAT THE MEMBER CONTINUES THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED AB. ELEVEN MEMBERS THAT WERE NOT OPPOSED TO REDEVELOPMENT DONE RESPONSIBLY AND ON A LIMITED BASIS WE WE CERTAINLY DON'T OPPOSE THE CONCEPT I THINK WHAT WE OPPOSE IN REGARDS TO THIS BILL AND ESPECIALLY IS ONE OF THE LEADING PROPERTY RIGHTS ASSOCIATIONS. IN CALIFORNIA IS A I MEAN A FEW THINGS NUMBER ONE EMINENT DOMAIN AND THE TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY FOR PRIVATE USE -- BUT ALSO JUST THE THE IMPLICATIONS OF TAXING COMMAND AND LONG TERM DEBT. YOU KNOW ANY LONG TERM DEBT IS GOING TO BE ON PROPERTY ROLES FOR THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS -- THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND AT SO PAM PAYMENT EVERY DEVELOPMENT BONDS DON'T HAVE FIRST CALL ON GENERAL FUND REVENUE AND I THINK FOR THOSE REASONS IT'S ALL THE MORE REASON THAT BURGER SHOULD HAVE A SAY -- REGARDING THESE PROJECTS THAT THEY APPROVE THAT ARE GONNA LAST FAR LONGER THAN THE MEMBERS THAT APPROVE THEM ON OFFICE ON ON A GPA OR IN A CITY COUNCIL FOR INSTANCE -- SO I MEAN WE ARE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF VOTER APPROVAL AND EMINENT DOMAIN BROADLY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR BOB NAYLOR REPRESENTING FEELS THAT IN COMPANY JUST TO ADD. TO AS THE SECOND WITNESS -- WE'D MAKE TWO POINTS ONE IS THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE NOTORIOUSLY INEFFICIENT AND SPENDING THEIR HOUSING MONEY. THEY HAD TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND SPENT UPON DISSOLUTION. AND THEY PROPERTY OFF THE ROLLS. FOR AN AVERAGE OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THIRDS FOR FOR FIVE YEARS AN AVERAGE OF ELEVEN POINT TWO YEARS SO THEY ACQUIRE PROPERTY BY EMINENT DOMAIN. NONE DON'T DEVELOP. A SECOND POINT MISTER WOLF MADE ABOUT LONG TERM FINANCING BUT THIS COMMITS THE STATE TO BACK FILLING SCHOOL REVENUES. FOR UP TO FORTY FIVE YEARS. FOR A DEVELOPMENT THAT ONLY NEEDS TO BE ONE THIRD FOR HOUSING -- AND BY THE WAY IT COULD ALSO BE FOR OTHER PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE TRANSIT PRIORITY PROJECTS ARE NOT JUST INFRASTRUCTURE THEY CAN BE UP PROPERTY. SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THIS WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S CHOSEN A BETTER. PATH IN HIS BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] YES. SOMEONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST -- IN ENCOURAGED BY THE DIALOGUE GOING ON AND AN OPEN DISCUSSION AND KEEPING THAT MOVING FORWARD AND WE WILL SUPPORT TODAY AND RESERVE THAT RIGHT ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I REQUEST AND ENTERTAIN A MOTION. THERE MOTIONS SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE OR MAKE COMMENTS. TO THANK YOU MANAGER FIRST OF ALL AGAIN APPRECIATE -- THE WORK OF YOUR WORK AND YOUR SUPPORT AND AND THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE -- I THINK I'LL JUST MENTION A FEW THINGS -- THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING WITH REGARDS TO EMINENT DOMAIN OR DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING WITH REGARDS TO VOTER APPROVAL COMPARED TO REDEVELOPMENT ONE POINT OUT. WHAT WE ARE CHANGING IS -- THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS USED IN REDEVELOPMENT ONE POINT OH FOUR TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT IS NOT PART OF THIS PROPOSAL THIS PROPOSALS ONLY FOCUSED ON THE ABOUT 20% OF WHAT OLD REDEVELOPMENT WAS FOCUSED ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE PIECES. BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW LOOK -- FOR TO KEEP YOU ABREAST AS THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES. OKAY HEY -- I JUST WANT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M HONORED TO BE A CO AUTHOR YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS TRYING TO NARROW IT DOWN AND WE APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND LET'S CONTINUE A CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL OBVIOUSLY TODAY. US SECRETARY TAKE THE ROLE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I LACKEY BLOOM. BLOOM AYE BURNER HER VAST RAMOS. RAMOS SIDE THREE OF US THREE OF US SIDE ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT THE REVERSE HI VOEPEL [inaudible] HELL NO -- MEASURES AT THE BUS BILLS OUT. FIVE TWO ONE SURE WE MOVE ON TO SEE. I'D LIKE TO ASK MR SANTIAGO WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE PUBLIC BANKS MEASURE -- SO HE HOPEFULLY WILL BE COMING SHORTLY BUT I'VE GOT TWO OTHER MEASURES SO. WHEN WE GO TO ITEM NUMBER TWENTY THREE A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN OF THAT BE FAIR CERTAINLY? OKAY LET'S DO IT. PERSONALLY START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED BY THIS COMMITTEE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CHAIRPERSON AND YOUR STAFFS -- WORK ON THIS AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A MOMENT AS TO WHY -- THAT'S WHY MADE A LT OF SENSE TO DO THAT. SO COLLEAGUES THIS IS A BILL THAT ADDRESSES THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE BAY AREA. YOU KNOW THE BAY AREA AS AND AT THE CENTER OF OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS WITH THE RECORD HOME PRICES RENTS HOMELESSNESS LEVELS COUNTLESS RESIDENTS WHO SPEND. HOURS DRIVING EVERY DAY WERE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM THE FICTION AND WE'RE CONTEMPLATING MOVING. THE BAY AREA HAS FACE THIS CRISIS BECAUSE AS A REGION WE HAVE FAILED TO PRODUCE HOUSING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS FAILED TO PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FAILED TO PROTECT RESIDENTS FROM DISPLACEMENT. AND AT A TIME WHEN RECORD CREATION IN THE BAY AREA HAS BEEN AT A RECORD HIGH. A HOUSING IS A REGIONAL ISSUE REQUIRING POLICY AND FUNDING COORDINATION THERE HAS BEEN NO REGIONAL APPROACH IN THE BAY. INSTEAD WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND ONE COUNTIES A HUNDRED ONE CITIES AND NINE COUNTIES WHO BEEN LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES OFTEN LEADING TO INEFFICIENCIES AND MIXED UP MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. THE CONCEPT FOR THIS BILL CAME FROM A VERY DIVERSE AND LARGE COALITION OF BAY AREA HOUSING STAKEHOLDERS WHO WERE TYPICALLY AT ODDS WITH EACH OTHER WHO WORKED FOR THE BETTER PART OF TWO YEARS. TO ASK THE STATE TO EMPOWER OUR REGION TO HELP OURSELVES. BECAUSE NO PUBLIC ENTITY IN THE BAY AREA HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON HOUSING THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A REGIONAL HOUSING ENTITY CALLED THE HOUSING ALLIANCE FOR THE BAY AREA OR HABA. LIKE RECENT STATE ACTIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION AREA THAT CREATED THE BAY AREA TOLL AUTHORITY AS WELL AS WORK TO FOCUS ON THE BAY AREA THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION AUTHORITY. THIS BILL WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE THE THIRD ENTITY OF ITS TYPE REGIONALLY IN THE BAY. TRANSPORTATION BAY RESTORATION AND A HOUSING A NEW ENTITY FOCUSED ON OUR HOUSING NEEDS. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE BAY AREA NEEDS AN ADDITIONAL TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ANNUALLY TO ADDRESS OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS. THIS ENTITY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROPOSE REVENUE MEASURES ON THE BALLOT IN THE NINE BERRY COUNTIES. IT IS A SELF HELP APPROACH TO ENABLE OUR REGION TO RAISE REVENUES FOR OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES WITHOUT FURTHER BURNING THE STATE. THESE REVENUES WOULD BE ADDITIVE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE REGION. AND HABA THIS ENTITY WOULD NOT DIVERT ANY EXISTING REVENUES REVENUE STREAM FROM LOCAL JURISDICTION. WITH THESE REVENUES THE ENTITY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS PROVIDE STAFF REPORT SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUND TENANT SERVICES LIKE EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND ACCESS TO COUNSEL. RELIEVING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OF THESE RESPONSIBILITIES A SYMBOL PARCELS AND ACQUIRE LAND AND MONITORING FOR A REGIONAL SCALE. ONE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS BILL THIS BILL THIS ENTITY WOULD HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO REGULATE WORN FORCE LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS FOR ACQUIRE PROPERTY BY EMINENT DOMAIN. HABA WOULD BE GOVERNED BY BOARD COMPOSED OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WITH AN ADVISORY BOARD COMBINED AB COMPRISED OF REGIONAL HOUSING EXPERTS. WE APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS AMENDMENTS TO TAKE OUT SPECIFIC GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES IN THIS BILL TO ALLOW THE REGION'S LEADERS TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. I UNDERSTAND THESE CONVERSATIONS OF ALREADY STARTED AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUATION OF THAT. IN CONCLUSION. THE BERIA'S HOUSING CRISIS THREATENS NOT ONLY THE BAY BUT ME IS BUT THREATENS MAJOR ECONOMIC DRIVERS FOR OUR STATE. THIS BILL WOULD EMPOWER THE BAY AREA TO ADDRESS OUR REGIONAL HOUSING CRISIS WITH THAT LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES STARTING WITH D. TO ROUTE FROM AN ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY PARTNERS. GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME. THANK YOU. SO I'M GIVE THE ROW AND I'M WITH ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL. OUR MISSION IS TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES THROUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LAST YEAR I CO AUTHORED THIS REPORT IT'S CALLED ELEPHANT IN THE REGION CHARTING A PATH FOR BAY AREA METRO TO LEAD A BOLD. HOW ARE A BOLD REGIONAL HOUSING AGENDA? IN IN THIS REPORT WE LOOKED AT HOW OTHER REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY ARE DEALING WITH THEIR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN THEIR DISPLACEMENT CRISIS. AND ONE KEY FINDING FROM THIS REPORT IS THAT THOSE REGIONS HAVE A ROBUST HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT THEY HAVE FUNDING. AND THEY ALSO HAVE CAPACITY TO DELIVER BOB. ALL SEASON PROGRAMS AND DEPLOY INNOVATIVE FINANCING. WE ARE DEEPLY INVESTED IN THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S IT STARTS TO LAY THE GROUND WORK FOR THAT REGIONAL ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED. AND RIGHT NOW WE RELY ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO SOLVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. SO MANY LOCAL ARE JURISDICTIONS IN THE HOUSING DEPARTMENT SEE JUST BEEN GUIDED SINCE THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AND THEY'VE LOST. RESOURCES STAFF AND EXPERTISE. AND THIS BILL AS A WAY TO HELP US THESE JURISDICTIONS IT'S ALL CARROTS RATE IT'S FUNDING IT'S TA ITS HELP WITH LAND ASSEMBLY AND DATA TRACKING. AND THERE ARE NO STICKS OF LAND USE AUTHORITY OR EMINENT DOMAIN. AND SO FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS ENTERPRISE HAS BEEN ENGAGING HOUSING DEPARTMENTS AND PLANNING DEPARTMENTS THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE GROUND DEALING WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS. AND WE'VE ASKED THEM HOW CAN THE HOUSING ALLIANCE FOR THE BAY AREA HOW ABOUT HELP THEM. IN THESE ARE THESE ARE THE EXAMPLES THAT THEY GAVE. WHEN THE NEXT NATURAL DISASTER HITS HABIT CAN DEPLOY ITS EXPERTISE TO REBUILD HOMES AND COMMUNITIES? IT CAN PROVIDE THE CRITICAL GAP FUNDING NEEDED AROUND TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT AND HELP WITH LAND ASSEMBLY. AND IT CAN HELP CREATE AN EFFECTIVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM NEEDED BY FAMILIES THREATENED BY DISPLACEMENT. AND LASTLY I JUST WANT TO AND WITH THE POLL THAT CAME OUT TODAY -- FOR IN IT THIS POLL IS FOR BAY AREA -- RESIDENTS AND THE POLLS SHOW THAT THREE QUARTERS OF RESIDENTS AGREE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY NEEDS TO BE A REGIONAL APPROACH TO ADDRESSING. ARE THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE BAY AREA IT SHOULD NOT BE CITY BY CITY. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE I'M VERGE YOU'RE ABLE. THANK YOU. SEVEN OTHER. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR GOOD TO BE BACK. MATT REGION WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR REGION THE BAY AREA FROM A SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPH YOU'LL SEE ONE MAJOR METRO -- WHAT YOU WON'T SEE OR THE HUNDRED AND ONE LINE TO DRAW UP ALL OUR LITTLE CITIES IN? THE NINE COUNTRIES THAT ARE THERE -- IT'S ONE ECONOMY IT'S ONE ECONOMIC -- ENTITY -- OVER LEAST ONE COUNTY LINE EVERY DAY TO GET TO AND FROM WORK SO IT'S A VERY FLUID AREA -- IT'S ONE REGION BUT IT BY A QUIRK OF HISTORY IS CARVED UP INTO A LOT OF LITTLE PIECES -- THOSE LITTLE PIECES ON THEIR OWN CAN'T SOLVE OUR LARGE REGIONAL PROBLEMS WERE REGIONAL ORGANIZATION WE TRY TO CREATE REGIONAL SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE INDIVIDUAL AND TO THE CITY'S CANNOT ON THEIR OWN -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU MENTIONED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO -- WE SPONSORED AND OFFERED A MEASURE MEASURE A A TO RAISE REVENUES PARTIAL TAX -- TO CREATE -- INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG OUR BAY SHORE TO PROTECT OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OUR AIRPORTS OUR WATER TREATMENT PLANTS ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FROM FLOOD EVENTS ON FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. INDIVIDUALLY NONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES COULD DO THAT BUT COLLECTIVELY THEY CAN AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS -- THE HOBBIT THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING AND AGAIN WE'RE BUSINESS GROUP AND IN A SUPPORTING NEW REVENUES IN NEW TAXES IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR OUR MEMBER SOMETIMES. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE A PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AND THERE NEEDS TO BE PUBLIC INVESTMENT TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT. GOING TO SOLVE THEM -- BY THEMSELVES SO WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS WE SEE THIS IS AN ENTITY THAT CAN REALLY BE A MAJOR PLAYER A NEW TOOL IN OUR BOX WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE TOOL TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

RESILIENCE ENHANCING THE ABILITY OF OUR NATURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES RESPOND AND ADAPT TO INCREASING DROUGHTS FIRES AND FLOODS. BROUGHT ON BY CLIMATE CHANGE. THE LEGISLATION THAT I'VE BEEN INTRODUCED AB NINE FORTY EIGHT WILL CREATE THE KILEY VALLEY CONSERVATION PROGRAM WHICH WOULD OF COVERING MORE THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND ACRES. FOR REALIZING RESTORATION PRESERVATION AND RECREATION PROJECTS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD DOES NAY KILEY VALLEY IS A RESOURCE OF STATEWIDE SIGNIFICANCE. CALIFORNIA'S CREATED PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PRESERVE AND RESTORE CERTAIN RESOURCES OF THIS OF THE STATE. SUCH AS THE SANTA ANA RIVER AND LOWER AMERICAN RIVER AND RECOGNIZE THESE RESOURCES BEING OF STATEWIDE SIGNIFICANCE. THE NEED TO PROTECT KILEY VALUE FROM DEVELOPMENT PRESSURES IS GAINING MORE RECOGNITION BY THE STATE. BUT NO PROGRAM EXISTS OF FOLKS AS LOCAL AND STATE EFFORTS TO PRESERVE AND RESTORE A TIDY VALUE.

AND GIVE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER THE SHOT THAT COMPETING FOR SITE. UNDER THIS BILL A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN 80% DENSITY BONUS ABOVE EXISTING ZONING DENSITY. AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES AND CONCESSIONS GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND EQUITY BENEFITS FOR LOCATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOUR TRANSIT. A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS NEAR TRANSIT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN UNLIMITED DENSITY BONUS PLUS AN INCREASE IN HEIGHT WAR FLOOR AREA RATIO IS UP TO A LIMIT.

AND THIS JUST TAKES AWAY ONE OF THAT SORT OF CRITERIA -- THAT ALLOWS THE FLEXIBILITY FOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD UNDER ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS -- AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE MANY COST IN DEVELOPMENT ARE FIXED AND THE MORE INTENSELY WE CAN UTILIZE LAND -- BUT STILL WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- THE MORE EFFECTIVE WE CAN BE AND SO ARE YOUR AYE VOTE THAT TODAY THINK YOU.

SOME MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I THINK I MAY HAVE JUST LOST ONE VOTE ON THE FLOOR -- FOR THE SPELL BUT REMEMBERING LAND USE BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND HIGH RESOURCE AREAS OF THE STATE -- PLACES WITH GOOD SCHOOLS JOBS AT AT AT CENTER IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. AND INCREASING CHOICE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. MANY OF THE PLACES WITH THE MOST EXISTING RESOURCES AND AMENITIES REMAIN AND ACCESSIBLE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE LACK OF DANCE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING IS ONE OF THE MANY BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE ACCESS HI RESOURCE AREAS MAY OR MAY NOT BE NEAR EXISTING HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT BUT THEY CAN SUPPORT. GREEN INFILL DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS CRUCIAL TO SUPPORTING FUTURE TRANSIT EXPANSION. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THE STATE'S HOUSING NEEDS AND REDUCING AUTO DEPENDENCE WE NEED TO INCREASE DENSITY AND EXPAND INFILL DEVELOPMENT. IN MORE PARTS OF OUR STATE. AB TWELVE SEVENTY NINE WOULD USE DATA AND MAPPING TO IDENTIFY HIGH RESOURCE AREAS WERE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS PREDOMINANTLY LOW DENSITY AND SCREEN OUT PLACES THAT ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT. THE REMAINING AREAS AREAS WHERE THERE ARE STRONG INDICATORS OF EXCLUSIONARY LAND USE PATTERNS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ZONING OVER RIGHTS TO ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCTION. OF DANCE SMALL SCALE MARKET RATE HOUSING AND LARGER SCALE MIXED INCOME AND AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING -- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CITIES DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF HOUSING TYPES. AT A RANGE OF INCOME LEVELS EVEN PLACES THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE FROWNED UPON DENSITY. THANK YOU AND TO HAVE FUN ON A LAWLER AND BRIGHT ACOSTA WITH HERE TO TESTIFY. WELCOME GOOD EVENING.

THANK YOU. RIGHT ACOSTA -- ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR THE BILL IN THE ROBUST DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING ON HOUSING THIS YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS BILL AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT WHICH IS.

TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- COLLEAGUES OUT FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT AB. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE LEGISLATION THAT CREATES AN OPT IN TOOL. TO HELP ADDRESS OUR FARM WORKER HOUSING SHORTAGE HI FIRST LIKE TO THANK LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THE ANALYSIS I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL AMENDMENT THAT WAS IN THAT ANALYSIS SO THANK YOU -- ALSO SPECIAL THEY GET MY COLLEAGUES ARE CO AUTHORING THIS LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- CHIU. FROM GEM CISCO SENATORS ON A COPY AT ALL MY THE ISLAND I DORADO AND SCOTT WIENER. I AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE ARE ALL WELL AWARE. THAT CALIFORNIA IS FACING A SEVERE HOUSING SHORTAGE. AND THE SHORTAGE IS IT JUST AN URBAN PROBLEM MANY AGRICULTURAL AREAS IN THE STATE ALSO FACE A HOUSING CRISIS. IN RURAL MONTEREY COUNTY ONE IN TEN STUDENTS. AS HOMELESS. IN FACT WE HAVE TWELVE SCHOOLS WERE ONE IN FIVE STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS. AND THEN THERE SURE WOULD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN SALINAS. WHERE 40% 40% OF THE STUDENTS AT THAT SCHOOL HOMELESS? WE HAVE FAMILIES LIVING FOURTEEN PEOPLE TO AN APARTMENT. AND OTHERS ARE SLEEPING IN CARS OR UNDER FREEWAY OVERPASSES. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY TOUGH ON OUR FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. FARMWORKERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. THEM WITH OUR FAMILY FARMERS. THEY WORK TO BRING THE FRESHEST PRODUCE TO MARKET. AND CERTAINLY DO THEIR PART IN HELPING FEED THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. THEY WORK HARD EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH THE HOPE THAT ONE DAY THEIR CHILDREN. WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL. THEY'LL BE ABLE TO BUY A HOME. HAVE DECENT HEALTH CARE. AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO LIVE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. YET THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE AND DECENT PLACES FOR THEM TO LIVE. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM AND IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE GREAT TO OPT IN STREAMLINED PROCESS TO BUILD FORMER HOUSING ON AGRICULTURAL LAND. IT SETS QUALITY STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW HOUSING IS DIGNIFIED [inaudible] FAMILY FRIENDLY. AND PUT SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. LOOK THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET AS WE'VE SEEN IN THIS HEARING HERE TODAY. TO SOLVE THIS HOUSING CRISIS. BUT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD. ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL CREATE A TOOL KIT. IT CREATES A TOOL FOR OUR FARMERS TO USE IF THEY CHOOSE TO USE IT. IF THEY WOULD RATHER NOT UTILIZE IT. THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SEEK PERMITTING THE BILL HOUSING JUST AS THEY WOULD RIGHT NOW. I'VE SPOKEN TO LOCAL FARMERS LOCAL FARMERS WHO HAVE THANK ME FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY WOULD UTILIZE THIS TOOL THIS OPTION. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE COME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SANTA CRUZ COUNTY FARM BUREAU HAS ALSO COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I AM NEW TO THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY. AND IS ONE OF THE NEWS COLLEAGUES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT I CAN SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE. I CAN SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FARM WORKER HOUSING. FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. DID YOU SEE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FORMER GREAT ALMADEN VINEYARDS AND PISCINE THIS CALIFORNIA. HE WITH MY GRANDMOTHER MY MOM WHO IS A SINGLE PARENT. THEY RAISED MY BROTHER AND I I GREW UP IN FORMER HOUSING. I LIVED WITH TEN MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY. OUR HOUSING COMPLEXES LOCATED RIGHT BESIDE THE VINEYARD WHEN MY GRANDFATHER WORKED EVERY SINGLE DAY. OUR HOUSING WAS VERY VERY BASIC. BUT IT WAS A DECENT. IN OUR SMALL TWO ROOM HOME IT GAVE OUR FAMILY THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR A BETTER LIFE. A FARM WORKER HOUSING. FARM WORKER HOUSING ALLOWED MY FAMILY THE CHANCE TO GET OUT OF THE FIELDS AND INTO THE CLASSROOM. BUT MANY FARMWORKERS THEN AND NOW. ARE NOT SO LUCKY. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO WORK THE FEELS LIKE MY GRANDFATHER DID. AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR CURRENT GENERATION OF FARMWORKERS. THAT THEIR CHILDREN. ALSO HAVE THE CHANCE AT A BETTER LIFE AND A BRIGHTER FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MADAM CHAIR I'M JOINED HERE TODAY BY A BILL SPONSOR AND OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I'LL ASK THEM TO DO THIS THEMSELVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS A BIT OF AN ON THIS AND I AM THE CIVIC PARTICIPATION POLICY COORDINATOR WITH THE UFW FOUNDATION. TOO MANY CALIFORNIA FARMWORKERS SUFFER HORRIBLE AND INADEQUATE HOUSING. I CONDITIONS BUILT ON FARM WORKER HOUSING SYSTEM CREATED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST CENTURY. LABOR CAMPS DID NOT HAVE. A TENDENCY PROTECTIONS LABOR CAMPS DID NOT HAVE TITLE TWENTY FOUR REGULATIONS. THEY DO NOT HAVE RENT STABILITY. LABOR CAMPS WERE COLD. DAMP AND INDECENT. AND THEY WERE CONTROLLED BY EMPLOYERS. TODAY. FARMWORKERS LIVE. IN GARAGES. INDIRECT STYLE. HOUSING TRAILERS WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING THAT MAKE SUMMER LIVING [inaudible] BRUTAL. IF I MAY SHARE WHAT A FARM WORKER. WHAT FARMWORKERS THEMSELVES ARE SAYING? APPELLEE NOT CRUISE A WINE GRAPE WORKER IN THE SANTA ROSA REGION SAYS QUOTE RENT FOR AN APARTMENT. OR STUDIO IS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THE PLACE. FOR ME SAYS THAT'S TOO MUCH MONEY. EFRAIN GARCIA. WHO IS NOW HOMELESS AFTER THIRTY NINE YEARS WORKING IN THE FIELD SAYS QUOTE? TO WARM UP MY FOOD. I'M ALWAYS BOTHERING MY FRIENDS. ASKING TO PLEASE ALLOW ME TO MAKE MYSELF A TACKLE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS'S FARM WORKER HOUSING ACT PROPOSES TO SIMPLE SOLUTIONS. AND POWER GOOD ACTORS TO BUILD FARM WORKER HOUSING. AND DO IT SO QUICKLY.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL CAN'T BE OVERSTATED SO DEFINITELY -- IN GREATER SUPPORT -- AND YEAH IF. I I JUST WANT TO MENTION TO THAT AND THAT ULTIMATELY THE ABILITY TO HAVE THIS KIND OF HOUSING. IS IS WHAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO COME OUT OF POVERTY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO TO ADDRESS THESE FAMILY ISSUES AT HOME -- AND YOU'RE HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW NOT ONLY WHERE YOU GET THE NEXT MEAL BUT THE HAVING A ROOF OVER YOUR OVER YOUR HEAD. IT MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. THANK YOU YEAH IT JUST MAKES IT REALLY IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO EVEN PAY ATTENTION. SO. I WAS LUCKY I GREW UP IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WHO WERE WHERE WE HAD A REALLY GREAT PROGRAM. THAT ALLOWED MY FAMILY. TO GIVE ME THE UP [inaudible] GOD. RED DIRT FROM SANTA CRUZ SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I SUPPORT. OKAY WE HAVE A WITNESS THE OPPOSITION WILL GO. YEAH ONE OF OPPOSITION QUEMADA. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I MATTHEW ON REPRESENT RUSTING GORGEOUS ASSOCIATION THIS AFTERNOON -- WESTERN GROWS AS AN OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS BILL -- WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED OPPORTUNITIES WE'VE HAD TO DISCUSS FORMER HOUSING -- AND THE BILL WITH THE OTHER TO STAFF WE STE WITH FIND OURSELVES IN THE SAME COMMISSION THAT WAS THE POSITION OF THE STARTED AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO ENGAGING IN THESE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE A LACK OF AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE STATE HOUSING FOR FARMWORKERS HAS LONG BEEN A PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER THE MINISTERIAL PERMITTING PROCESS AS DELINEATED IN THIS BILL CURRENTLY WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNLESS THE FARMER TURNS OPERATION OTHER HOUSING OVER TO A THIRD PARTY. OUT FEW FARMERS WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THIS AS THEY WOULD REMAIN ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HOUSING AND ANY LIABILITY CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS OPERATION. WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD INSTEAD COMMITTED TO FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE THAT DOES NOT DISCOURAGE OUR FARMERS FROM DEPLOYING THEIR CAPITAL AND THEIR LAND TO MEET THIS URGENT NEED. WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED AT THE SAME TIME ABOUT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT STATE FUNDING FOR THE PLANNING DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF HOUSING. THAT WOULD BE UTILIZED FOR H. TO A EMPLOYEES. THE REALITY IS THAT FARMERS HERE AND ELSEWHERE IN UNITED STATES ARE TURNING TO THE H. CHOI PROGRAM IN DESPERATION DUE TO THE ONGOING LABOR SHORTAGE THAT WE HAVE AN AD. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH -- THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE BUT AS FAR HOUSING IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WE JUST BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS FROM A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO LEVERAGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM HERE WHERE REGRETTABLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO THIS BILL I WE DO APPLY THE AUTHORS INTEREST IN EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORMER HOUSING WE SHARE THAT GOAL -- UNFORTUNATELY JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE HAD MENTIONED WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THE EXEMPTION IS PROVIDED AS IS SO LIMITED IN ADDITION TO HAVING A QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATION OPERATES -- WITH NO LIABILITY PROTECTIONS THERE'S ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CITING. SO UNDER THE BILL YOU COULD NOT CITE ANY OF THIS HOUSING ON LINKEDIN ACT PLANS WHICH IS SIXTEEN MILLION OF THE THIRTY MILLION FARM AND RANCH LANDS IN CALIFORNIA -- YOU ALSO CAN'T CITED IN THE COASTAL ZONE. ACOSTA PROGRAMS ARE PREDICATED ON STATE AND LOCAL APPROVAL OF HAVING FARM WORKER HOUSING AS A MANDATORY PORTION OR VERY IMPORTANT PORTION OF OUR COASTAL AGRICULTURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY WHERE. HOUSING COSTS ARE TREMENDOUS JUST AS THE COMMENTARY WAS A NAPA. I'M BEYOND THAT I THINK WE HAVE SOME. BROADER CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL TRYING TEN HOUSING RIGHTS TO EMPLOYEE HOUSING RATES -- NOW THIS WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH HOW WE ACT FOR ANY OTHER EMPLOYEE WHERE PROVIDED WE'RE HOUSING AS A CONDITION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. I'M IT WOULD ONLY BE FOR THESE AGRICULTURAL PLAYS REGARDLESS I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WE WANT OUR EMPLOYEES TO FEEL. COMFORTABLE AND THE HOUSING OPERATION THAT THEY FEEL IS AFFORDABLE AND IS SAFE -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY. WELL IN THE END I THINK IT PRACTICALLY WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS COVER DISCRIMINATIONS PROTECTIONS AND SOME OF THOSE TEN OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE THERE FOR AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEES ARE READY SO WE DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH THOSE CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY AND THEN I THINK. PRACTICALLY TIME TEN HOUSING RIGHT SIMPLY HOUSING RATES JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE UNDER CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING TEN HOUSING RATES LAW. YOU HAVE A THIRTY DAYS NOTICE TO EFFECT -- IF YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE AND YOU'RE FIRED FOR CAUSE IN AN IN HOUSING SITUATION. THAT EMPLOYEE WITH AND HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESIDE WITHIN THAT HOUSING FOR THIRTY DAYS -- SO WHILE THEY'RE PROVIDED THAT NOTICE TO MOVE OUT THAT MEANS THAT. IF YOU'VE BEEN FIRED FOR CAUSE AND AT THAT COULD BE INCREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE. I TO THE OPERATION AND IN ADDITION YOU'RE TAKING AWAY A POSITION THAT COULD BE FILLED WITH THE REPLACEMENT EMPLOYEE WHO'S EQUALLY LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES -- SO BASED ON THESE CONCERNS WE WE WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE THREE BEST MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE CHECK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRY COMMISSION CALIFORNIA CUT FLOWER COMMISSION CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURSING GARDEN CENTERS AND AMERICAN PISTACHIO GROWERS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED BUT LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU. OKAY. IN. YOUR SCHOOLS AROUND TOO MANY -- SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND NEED A SECOND. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND -- WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE IT -- DRESSER THE QUESTIONS OR PRODUCT AGAIN I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I REMAIN -- COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL SIDES AS I'VE -- I'VE DONE SO SINCE THE BEGINNINGS AS WE INTRODUCE THIS LEGISLATION -- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY TRANSPARENT AND WE WILL -- MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND RESPECTFUL AN HONOR AND AND AND AND HONEST MANNER -- THIS BILL AB SEVENTEEN A THREE SIMPLY CREATES AN OPT IN. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT'S WHY THIS THIS BILL WOULD PROPOSE TO CREATE A PROGRAM THAT IS VOLUNTARY. AND OPTED IF IT DOESN'T FIT THE NEEDS OF AGRICULTURE OPERATION OR FARM THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO IT -- YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY TO TOOL FOR OUR FARMERS UTILIZED IF. IF THEY CAN'T -- BUT PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS BILL THIS ISSUE IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC. ISSUE IS NOT A REPUBLICAN ISSUE THIS IS A HUMANITARIAN ISSUE -- AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SOMETHING AND TO ACT. THIS IS YOU KNOW BY NO MEANS AN EXHAUSTIVE BILL OF WITH THERE'S A LOT OF THESE IN AGRICULTURE WORKFORCE HOUSING AND I INTEND TO BUILD. A YOU UPON THE FOUNDATION OF THIS LEGISLATION AND CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE -- YOU KNOW I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- ARE FARMWORKERS CERTAINLY NEED YOUR HELP -- AND LET'S KEEP -- THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ALIVE FOR THEM AND CERTAINLY FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND I RESPECT THAT'S WHEN I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- IF THERE'S EVER AND THE NEED TO STREAMLINE. NO BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT -- AN OPT IN. AND YOU MADE IT SO FARMERS COULD CHOOSE TO USE IT OR NOT. AND THAT'S A BIG STEP FOR MANY PEOPLE I THINK WORK REALLY HARD ON THIS BILL -- IT SHOWS A LOT OF PROMISE -- I HAVE I KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION. AND WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY WITH IT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT -- I'D LIKE TO CALL CO AUTHOR AS WELL. I'M SORRY WHAT A CO AUTHOR AS WELL THANK YOU YEAH.

RAMOS RAMOS SIDE THREE OF US ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVAS I VOEPEL HELL NO. THE BILL HAS THREE VOTES FOR HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE MISSING. FOR ME DOING WE JUST IN ONE MORE VOTE OF THAT. I'M WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A FIVE MINUTE. BREAK WILL COME BACK ABOUT A LITTLE. FIVE THIRTY SEVEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT STARTED -- WE ARE NO. ALL RIGHT WE ARE NOW ON ITEM NUMBER NINE AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN WELCOME. ASSEMBLYMEMBER SHOE IN SANTIAGO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES IN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS. BILL LET ME FIRST START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK I KNOW THE STAFF IS DONE AND AND THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD. WE ARE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND THIS IS A BILL ABOUT ALLOWING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN FINANCES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE INVESTED IN WALL STREET BANKS AND THIS IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT IF THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. WANTS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR CHARTER TO ENSURE THAT THEIR MONIES AND THEIR SAVINGS ARE BUSTED AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WITH THEIR LOCAL CONSTITUENTS THEY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTION TO CHARTER A LOCAL PUBLIC BANK BUT IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH A PUBLIC BANK IT ONLY CREATES THE PROCESS TO DO IN IT WHICH IS A MULTI YEAR PROCESS WITH MANY HURDLES. I KNOW WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT CONCERNS OF INSURING THAT PUBLIC BANK ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED. I WILL TELL YOU THAT MISTER SANTIAGO AND I'D THAT IS A CONCERN WE HOLD TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL. UNLIKE PRIVATE BANKS THIS BILL REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANK TO ABIDE BY A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO PROTECT ITS ASSETS IT REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS. OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON BANKING LAW WITH ALL REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE RELATED. NOW IN ADDITION TO THE BILL'S REQUIREMENT THE PUBLIC BANKS KEEP THE SAME COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AS PRIVATE BANKS THE MINUTES THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE REQUIRED PUBLIC BANK TO MAINTAIN FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE BILL'S REQUIREMENT OF INITIAL BUSINESS PLAN THIS COMMITTEE HAS ASKED US TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO DO TO REQUIRE A LOCAL AGENCY APPLYING FOR CHARTER TO ANALYZE COSTS. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS LEGALITY ECCENTRIC. I KNOW THERE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS BANK INTERSECTS WITH LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE CREDIT UNIONS AND COMMUNITY BANKS AND LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR. COUNTRY TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS BILL THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANK WHEREVER POSSIBLE TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. TO CONDUCT RETAIL SERVICES THROUGH THOSE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS IT'S MODELED AFTER THE PUBLIC BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WHICH FOR A HUNDRED YEARS THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HAS SUCCESSFULLY PARTNERED WITH LOCAL BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS WITH PROFITABLE RETURNS TO THE PUBLIC. THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE RESPONSE TO THE MAIN ARGUMENT BY THE OPPOSITION THAT SUPPORTERS OF PUBLIC BANKS. HAVEN'T SHOWN HOW THE CURRENT. BIG BANKING INDUSTRY HAS NOT MET THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC AND NOT MET THE NEEDS OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS I THINK OF YOUR THEY WOULD HAVE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE AFTERMATH OF CONSUMERS WHO BEEN VICTIMIZED BY PREDATORY LENDING. WHO'VE HAD MILLIONS OF FAKE BANK ACCOUNTS OPEN IN THEIR NAMES WHO'VE LOST FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN INTEREST PAYMENTS AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE AFTERMATH OF HOMEOWNERS VICTIMIZED BY MORTGAGE FORECLOSURES STUDENTS VICTIMIZED BY KRITI LENDERS. SMALL BUSINESSES DENIED ACCESS TO CAPITAL. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE HAVING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF THEIR DOLLARS INVEST AGAINST THEIR COMMUNITY VALUES IN FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES. GUN MANUFACTURERS PRIVATE PRISONS COMPANIES WITH UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES. WITH THIS BILL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE CHANCE TO KEEP TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN CONTINUE TO SEND THIS TO CERTAIN OF THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS TO CREATE LOCAL JOBS BILL LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND STABILIZE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SO WITHOUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT CAME OUT OF A MOVEMENT THAT WAS BUILT IN TWELVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SAN DIEGO. ORANGE COUNTY AND LOS ANGELES SANTA BARBARA SANTA CRUZ -- SAN JOSE IN THE SOUTH BAY SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND EAST BAY SANTA ROSA EUREKA THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ASKING FOR THIS. AND SO WITHOUT I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS BILLOUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO ASK MY JOINT AUTHOR WHO HAS BEEN A TRUE PARTNER IN THIS ENDEAVOR -- MISTER SANTIAGO FOR HIS OPENING STATEMENT -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WOULD ENGAGE ON THIS CONVERSATION A WE KEEP COMING BACK BUT WE REALLY WANTED TO DO THE POINT THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS -- POLICY PROPOSAL AND IMAGINE A PUBLIC BANK FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD -- AS OPPOSED TO SOME OF THE CURRENT BIG BANK -- OUR PRACTICES A SYSTEMS. AND ILL LET LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT -- THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS AND IT'S A SERIOUS PROCESS AND YOU KNOW FOLKS WILL ARE YOU WILL WHAT IF A BANK. WHAT IF THE CITY CAN'T DO IT OUR TAXPAYERS AT RISK SIX CETERA? THE SERIES PROPOSAL WITH SERIOUS SAFEGUARDS NUMBER ONE WE'RE GONNA TAKE FDIC INSURANCE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE WORN IT'S NOT GOING TO PROVE SOMETHING THAT IS AND FISCALLY SOLVENT PERIOD WE KNOW THAT -- THERE'S A BE A RIGOROUS STUDY IN ADVANCE. THAT WILL HAVE PLAYED A FINANCIAL PLAN GOVERNANCE A PUBLIC BENEFIT -- PURPOSE WILL BE PUBLIC MEETINGS IT COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT -- IT'LL HAVE TO GO TO DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA PROVE SOMETHIN IS A FISCALLY SOLVENT LET'S LET'S PUT THAT ON THE TABLE. I AND THEY'LL HAVE TO WILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY FEDERAL LAWS IN ANY OF THE REGULATIONS. WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING DIFFERENT -- THAN ANY OTHER RECORD BURBANK COMMUNITY -- BANK OR CREDIT UNION WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SET UP. BUT A LOT BEEN SAID -- IT IN ALL REPEAT SOME IS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SAID THAT TAXPAYERS DOLLARS WOULD BE AT RISK HAVING LAID OUT THAT RIGOROUS PROCESS -- THAT WE JUST LAID OUT IF IF THAT WE'RE GONNA BE THE CASE THEY WOULDN'T GET A BANK LOCAL MISS KELLY SO THE CONVERSATION IS MOOT OFF THE TABLE. ON IT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN SAID THAT -- DIED LOCAL BANKS WILL STOP INVESTING OUR COMMUNITIES. I ACTUALLY THINK THEY MIGHT INVEST A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE NOW THERE'S COMPETITION THERE'S A THERE'S A MOTIVE TO INVEST MORE -- I THINK COMPETITION IS ALWAYS HELPED US QUITE FRANKLY I DON'T SEE IT SITUATION WHERE HASN'T HELP THE CONSUMER HOUSE AND HELP THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY. YOU CAN ARGUE DIFFERENT BUT I'VE SEEN IT DIFFERENTLY -- THAT THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A LOSS OF JOBS -- QUICKLY LOOK AT PUBLIC VANCE'S JOB CREATORS -- THE ABILITY TO TO INVEST IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE ABILITY -- TO TO USE THOSE DOLLARS AT A LOCAL LEVEL ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY I WOULD ARGUE AS OPPOSED TO TAKING THOSE DOLLARS AND PUT THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE IN ANOTHER AREA FOR INVESTMENT. I MEAN IT'S IT'S ITS BEEN SAID TO THAT THE THE CORPORATE BANK WOULD HAVE A OUR BEST INTERESTS IN MIND. SOME MIGHT -- BUT I MIGHT ARGUE THAT THAT THEIR INTEREST OUR TO SHAREHOLDERS -- IN AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S THE PROFIT MOTIVE THAT WORKS AND THE BOTTOM LINE THAT'S AT THE CORE OF INTERESTS -- SO I'D ARGUE THAT THE REPUBLIC BANK -- IS REALLY IT IS A SERIOUS POLICY PROPOSAL AND AND LET'S THINK WHAT THIS PROPOSAL REALLY DOES NOT SAYING THIS -- YOU'RE SETTING UP A STATE BANK IT'S NOT SAYING IT'S MANDATED. IT'S SAYING THAT IF A LOCAL MUNICIPALITY WANTS TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. IN A GET PASS MUSTER THROUGH ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET. I DON'T WANNA LIST AGAIN BUT NONE THE LESS. THEN AND ONLY THEN. CAN ACTUALLY SET ONE UP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ANYONE ELSE FOR THIS WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE TO IN ASSISTS SO LIKE TO TURN. THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS DAVID JEDI IN WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE REPRESENTING TWELVE CITIES AND REGIONS IN THE STATE FROM SAN DIEGO TO EUREKA PLUS THE MORE THAN NINETY COMMUNITY GROUPS WHICH ENDORSE AND SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS. I IN WHO SEE THE NEED FOR MORE AND BETTER OPTIONS FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES TO BANK THEIR FUNDS LOCALLY. AND TO SATISFY THE PUBLIC'S DESIRE TO DIVEST FROM HARMFUL AND EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH ENABLE THEM. A MONTH AGO THE CITY OF SAN JOSE WAS FACED WITH A DILEMMA THEY COULD EITHER WAIVE THEIR WAGE THEFT PREVENTION POLICY AND ACCEPT A BID FROM JP MORGAN CHASE FOR THEIR BANKING SERVICES -- OR THEY COULD REJECT THAT BID AND ACCEPT THE SECOND BEST BID FROM WELLS FARGO WHICH HAS A SUB SATISFACTORY SEE OUR A RATING -- DUE TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS RELATED TO DEFRAUDING THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS A LOS ANGELES FACES THE SAME DILEMMA HAVING DISQUALIFIED WELLS FARGO FROM SUBMITTING AN RFP FOR BANKING SERVICES -- WHEN THEIR CONTRACT EXPIRED BUT WAS FORCED TO EXTEND THAT CONTRACT -- WHEN THERE WAS A LACK OF AVAILABLE OPTIONS TO BANK THE CITY'S MONEY THIS IS WHY THE CITIES OF LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND AND BERKELEY HAVE ALL ENDORSED THIS BILL? AND WHY SAN JOSE EUREKA SANTA CRUZ COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND SANTA ROSA ARE ALL CONSIDERING -- ENDORSEMENTS AS WELL A LOCAL AND COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BUT MOST ARE TOO SMALL TO HANDLE THE NEEDS OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND FALL. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE SAME MULTINATIONAL BANKS WHICH COLLAPSE ECONOMY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HAVE SQUEEZED AND DEPLETED THE LOCAL BANKING SECTOR WHICH HAS SHRUNK TO A QUARTER OF ITS FORMER SIZE -- SITTING COUNTY TREASURER'S HAVE FIDUCIARY DUTY TO MAKE PRINT INVESTMENTS AND ABIDE BY STRICT -- EXTENSIVE RULES ON HOW THEY DO THEIR JOB IN THIS BILL CHANGES ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THAT. THE BILL SIMPLY OPENS THE DOOR FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ANALYZE THE BENEFITS OF A STATE CHARTER PUBLIC BANK AND TO APPLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT FOR THAT CHARTER. IT REQUIRES FDIC INSURANCE FOR ALL RELEVANT DEPOSITS COLLATERAL CARMEN'S FOR PUBLIC DEPOSITS ARE ALSO REMAIN THE SAME. AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN MAKES ALL THE SAME REQUIREMENTS OF PUBLIC BANKS THAT THEY MAKE ON PRIVATE COMMERCIAL BANKS AND THEN SOME. AND IN ADDITION TO THE NEW LENDING AND SERVICE -- SERVICES THE PUBLIC BANKING BANKS CAN PROVIDE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- PUBLIC BANKS WILL PROVIDE NEW PARTNER FOR COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS A PARTNER WHO DOESN'T WANT TO STEAL OUR CUSTOMERS AND IN FACT IS LEGALLY PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO. THERE'S NO INTENT IN LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD PERMIT OR ENABLE PUBLIC BANKS FROM -- TO TO COMPETE WITH LOCAL BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS FOR EXISTING CONSUMER OR COMMERCIAL DEMAND ON THE CONTRARY IT REQUIRES THEM TO WORK THROUGH THOSE LOCAL BANKING PARTNERS TO EXTEND SERVICES. AND CREATE NEW CORRESPONDENT AND COOPERATIVE LENDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE OF THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A SMALL SCALE PUBLIC BANK SMALL SCALE COURSE BECAUSE SMALL STATE -- WHICH SERVES AS A WHOLESALE PARTNER TO LOCAL PRIVATE BANKS TO MAGNIFY THE BENEFITS OF THEIR INVESTMENT AND TARGET THEM TO THE PUBLIC GOOD -- AND AS ADVOCATES FOR TRANSPARENCY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE AND BANKING PUBLIC FUNDS WE'VE REALLY HAPPY THAT THESE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF PUBLIC BANKS IS WHAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BE A TRUSTWORTHY IT'S A SELF SUSTAINING PART OF OUR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND A VITAL PIECE. OF A HEALTHY BANKING SECTOR THAT SORELY LACKING TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS CHRIS PADLOCK -- I'M A CERTIFIED GOVERNMENT FINANCE OFFICER -- AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE VALLEY THE MOON WATER DISTRICT -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY SERVING THE PEOPLE OF SONOMA VALLEY. I LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES TO SERVE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FEEL PRESSURE TO MAXIMIZE PUBLIC FUNDS. TO KEEP TAXES AND RATES LOW WHILE AT THE SAME TIME TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THE COMMUNITY EXPECTS KEEP OUR ROADS PAVED THE WATER FLOWING. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRESTORM OUR DISTRICT WAS HEAVILY AFFECTED BY THE FIRE SO WE ALSO LEARN THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE WORK TO DO TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT FIRE STORM -- AS MANY PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY HAVE SHOWN TO BE VERY VULNERABLE. AS WELL WE ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS FOR INCREASED. DENSITY FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THIS IS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTMENTS THAT ARE MEDIAN SIGNIFICANT WHEN IT COMES TO IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THE UNDERLYING COST SHOULD NOT BE LOST AND ANY OF US. IT IS COMMON FOR THE COST OF THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO BE DOUBLED BY THE FINANCING COSTS WHETHER THROUGH BONTA TRADITIONAL BANK LENDING. SO WHEN WE LOOKED OF CASH FUND WE LOOKED OF CASH FUNDS MANY OF THESE PROJECTS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN BUT THIS OF COURSE IT EXPOSES US -- TO INFLATIONARY PRESSURE BECAUSE IT PUSHED PROJECTS FAR OFF INTO THE FUTURE. ON THE SAME PROJECT COST USING LENDING MODELS FOUND UNDER THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA -- FINANCING MODELS SHOW SIGNAL THESE COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THIS ALLOWS EITHER FOR HIGHER QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. MORE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS GETTING DONE MORE MILES PIPE IN THE GROUND AND LOWER RATES TO OUR TAXPAYERS. ON THE DEPOSITING A PUBLIC FUNDS I SEE A PUBLIC BANK IS ONE MORE SAFE PLACE TO PUT OUR PUBLIC FUNDS LIKE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INVESTMENT POLICIES HAD MANY RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE AND HOW MUCH WE CAN DEPOSIT ANYONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. WITH A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY LIQUIDITY AND RATE OF RETURN ON PUBLIC FUNDS SOME ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ARE INSISTED UPON BY MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT INCLUDE EVALUATIONS OF BUSINESS PRACTICES AND INVESTMENT PRACTICES. THAT PRECLUDE US FROM USING MANY INSTITUTIONS AS QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS FOR THE POSITIVE PUBLIC FUNDS. MANY TIMES FINANCE LOOSE INSTITUTIONS -- ARE EXCLUDED SIMPLY BECAUSE WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTABLISH WHETHER OR NOT THEY COMPLY WITH OUR INVESTMENT POLICIES BECAUSE WE LACK THE TIME AND RESOURCES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- TO MAKE THESE COULD YOU DO THIS KIND OF RESEARCH. A BANK WITH THE CHARTER AND INVESTMENT POLICY THAT IS. THAT IS DESIGNED FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD WOULD MAKE THIS TASK MUCH SIMPLER AND POSSIBLY PROVIDE HIGHER RATES OF RETURN ON DEPOSITS THAT WE CURRENTLY GET A COMMERCIAL BANKS AS DEMONSTRATED. IN NORTH DAKOTA'S PUBLIC BANK. I URGE AND EITHER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL [inaudible] TAYLOR JACK.

FUN WILL BE THERE FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE READY TO RETIRE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JASON LANE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION WE'D. VERY MUCH LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- AND THE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS -- TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS I THINK. YOU KNOW IT IT IT IS CERTAINLY HELPFUL BUT IT'S UNFORTUNATELY JUST NOT ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD TAXPAYER DOLLARS -- AND THE REASON IS SIMPLE THE MEASURE STILL ALLOWS -- STILL GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LICENSE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CREATION OF A A PUBLIC BANK NOT WITHSTANDING -- WHAT THE FEASIBILITY STUDY SAYS A OR WHAT ITS OUTCOME IS SO IT'S NOT UNFORTUNATELY SUBJECT TO ANY TYPE OF VOTE -- IT ONLY REQUIRES A PRESENTATION OF THE FEASIBILITY STUDY AND THIS IS WHY THIS GIVES US CONCERN -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL -- CREATED THE AS PART OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON JOBS IN THE ECONOMY WHICH WAS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE CITY COUNCIL. CREATED A TASK FORCE -- TO LOOK AT PUBLIC BANKING  THE RESULT OF THAT STUDY -- AFTER A YEAR'S WORTH OF HEARINGS WAS A HUNDRED PAGE REPORT CREATED BY THE CITY ANALYST OFFICE AND THAT REPORT SHOWED. THAT THE COST IN THE WRIST TO TAXPAYER DOLLARS DO NOT WARRANT THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC BANK AND THE ENCOURAGE THE CITY COUNCIL. TO TO LOOK AT STRENGTHENING EXISTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOLS RATHER THAN GOING FORWARD WITH THE PUBLIC BANK. NOT WITHSTANDING THAT IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CITY COUNCIL VOTED TO PUT MEASURE BE ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER WHICH ALTERS THE CITY'S CHARTER TO ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF THE PUBLIC BANK. THE CITY COUNCIL IGNORED THE DATA AND THEY MOVED FORWARD. IN SAN FRANCISCO THE CITY TREASURER CREATED A MUNICIPAL BANK TASK FORCE. AND THAT TASK FORCE ALSO HAD HEARINGS FOR A YEAR AND CONCLUDED WITH YET ANOTHER HUNDRED PAGE STUDY. THIS STUDY HAD FOUR DIFFERENT MODELS ALL FOUR MODELS RESULTED IN A LOSS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND COST TO THE CITY. NOT WITHSTANDING THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SAN FRANCISCO UNANIMOUSLY ENDORSE THE VERY PRODUCT THAT'S EMBODIED IN AB. EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN SO THE FEASIBILITY STUDY IN AND OF ITSELF IS IS NOT A SAFE COURT -- SANTA FE. WASHINGTON STATE WASHINGTON STATE ACTUALLY HAS A STUDY OF THE STUDIES LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO MASSACHUSETTS ALL OF THEIR FEASIBILITY STUDIES CONCLUDED. THAT THERE IS ENORMOUS COST IN CAPITAL IN MAINTAINING THE OPERATION OF A BANK AN ENORMOUS RISK TO TAXPAYERS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THE LOS ANGELES REDEVELOPMENT BANK WENT BANKRUPT IT TOOK GRANT MONEY AND MADE SMALL BUSINESS LOANS. AND 40% OF THOSE LOANS WERE CHARGED OFF A CHARGE OFF AS A LOSS IN IN IN IN WHEN A WHEN A PUBLIC BANK HAS LOSSES IT HAS TO ANSWER TO THE TAXPAYER. WHEN A PRIVATE BANK HAS LOSSES IT HAS TO ANSWER -- YOU KNOW HAS TO ANSWER TO SHAREHOLDERS -- SO YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE URGE YOU TO TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE TO VOTE NO THERE'S A LOT IN THIS BILL THAT'S LACKING -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IT IS NOTABLE IS THAT. WHEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS TO COMPETE WENT WHEN IT WHEN THE PUBLIC ENTITY ENGAGES IN COMMERCE IN COMPETITION WITH A PRIVATE ENTITY IT OUGHT TO BE? REQUIRED TO PAY TAXES THIS BILL ACTUALLY ESTABLISHES A SEPARATE CORPORATE STRUCTURE. THAT CORPORATION SHOULD PAY INCOME TAXES THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT IT WOULD NOT PAY INCOME TAXES. THE CORPORATE TAX RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS EIGHT POINT 8% THE BANK TAX RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS TEN POINT 8% SO IT'S A HIGHER NUMBER THAN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE WHEN YOU'RE TAKING INCOME PRODUCING. ACTIVITIES THAT ARE TAXABLE AWAY FROM PRIVATE INDUSTRY IN TRANSFERRING TO THEM TO A PUBLIC ANDY THAT'S NOT PAYING TAXES THERE WILL BE A HIT TO THE GENERAL FUND. CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU'VE HEARD HERE TODAY THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT STIPULATES THAT HE PUBLIC BANK HAS TO ADHERE TO ALL FEDERAL BANKING LAWS. NOR IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE BILL THAT SAYS THE MEASURE THAT OUR PUBLIC BANK HAS TO ADHERE TO THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT. WAR OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED SWEEPING PRIVACY LEGISLATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED NEXT YEAR IT OUGHT TO HAVE THAT IN THE BILL. FINALLY IF THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S MONEY IF IT'S ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL THEN WE SHOULD SHOULD JACK THIS TO A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE AS THEY DID WITH MEASURE V. IN LA WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO CREATE A PUBLIC BANK. NOT NOTE THEY VOTED NO THANK YOU. URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MARGARET GLAD SHE NUMBER HAVE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORK OUR MEMBERS ARE SOLELY SMALL COMMUNITY BANKS ARE BOARDS AND OUR CUSTOMERS ARE BAKED BASED IN THE COMMUNITIES AND WE WERE VAST ARE FUNDS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. WHY DO APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE THAT THE AMENDMENTS TO AUTHOR TOOK AND THE WORK THIS COMMITTEES DONE -- AND THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT TALKS ABOUT PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY BANKS AND MISTER SANTIAGO IN HIS PRESENTATION TALKED ABOUT HOW THESE BANKS WOULD COMPETE WITH COMMUNITY BANKS. GREEN BANKS ARE STRUGGLING IN CALIFORNIA TODAY THE NUMBER WE'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY BANKS AS A MERGER AND TAKING OVER BY LARGER INSTITUTIONS. SOME OF OUR BANKS ARE DOING AMAZING THINGS MY PARTNERING WITH GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THE AYE BANK TODAY THIS COMMITTEE WHEN IT JOINED WITH THE SOMEONE BANKING COMMITTEE AND A INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT PUBLIC MAKING. HEARD BANKERS TALK ABOUT THE AMAZING THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING IN THIS COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW TO PARTNER AND GROW AND REINVEST IN THE COMMUNITY. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE. LOCAL FUNDS LOCAL AGENCY DEPOSIT THAT CURRENTLY COMMUNITY BANKS ARE TAKING AND REINVESTING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM US WITH COMPETITION FROM THE STATE SO FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE. EMILY ACT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE IN OPPOSITION. FAILURE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSED IT IS STILL ON OUR JOCULARLY SAYS WE DO BELIEVE. THAT THIS BILL WILL COST JOBS LOCALLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SO WHO IS RUNNING ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. I HAVE. ONE SO THIS WOULD TO THE BANKING COMMITTEE SO IT SEEMS TO ME THESE BANKING QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMING UP. WERE THEY ADDRESSED DURING THAT THAT TESTIMONY ABSOLUTELY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH BANKING COMMITTEE STAFF -- BUT IF I COULD JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ABOUT -- WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE BANKING LOBBYISTS AND IT WAS INTERESTING THAT THE ARGUMENTS HAVE SHIFTED BETWEEN THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE RAISED ON MONDAY AND THE ARGUMENTS AND REYES TODAY BUT IF I CAN SAY A FEW THINGS? FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW. THE PROCESS INVOLVES A VERY LENGTHY ANALYSIS ON A FEASIBILITY STUDY. AND THE BANKING LOBBY SUGGEST THERE'S NOT A VOTE THAT IS NOT TRUE IN FACT I WILL JUST SAY -- IT IS IN ACTUALLY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ANNOUNCES ITSELF ON PAGE NINE SAYS THE STUDY THAT'S REQUIRED MUST BE PRESENTED AN APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE LOCAL AGENCY. AT A PUBLIC MEETING PRIOR TO THE LOCAL AGENCY SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN A LOCAL JURISDICTION MOVING FOR WITH THIS WITHOUT PUBLIC OFFICIALS. ANALYZING THE DATA AND FIGURED OUT SO POINT NUMBER. ONE UP. NUMBER TWO THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW -- THIS IS GOING TO KILL COMMUNITY BANKS AND I COULD NOT DISAGREE WITHOUT MORE STRONGLY. THE LAW OUR BILLS SPECIFICALLY SAYS. THAT ANY LOCAL PUBLIC BANK WOULD BE REQUIRED TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY BANKS IN FACT QUITE THE OPPOSITE HAS HAPPENED IN RECENT YEARS THE WALL STREET BANKS. HAVE ACTUALLY KILLED 75% OF CALIFORNIA LOCAL BANKS OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THERE WERE FIVE HUNDRED COMMUNITY BANKS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS YEAR THERE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN NORTH DAKOTA. IS COMMUNITY BY THE COMMUNITY BANKING SYSTEM HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ENHANCED BY THE EXISTENCE OF A PUBLIC BANK -- I WANT TO ADDRESS THE THE JOB KILLER SUGGESTION BY THE CHAMBER WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE WALL STREET BANKS WERE TALKING ABOUT DESTROYED COUNTLESS JOBS. WITH THE LAST FINANCIAL CRISIS COUNTLESS JOBS RELATED TO THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURES CRISIS COUNTLESS JOBS THAT ARE IMPACTED BECAUSE A PREDATORY LENDING OF THE FACT THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE NOT BEEN LIED. TO AND OUR VISION OF PUBLIC BANKS IS THAT THEY ARE JOB CREATORS THAT THEY ARE INVESTING IN LOCAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY'RE INVESTING IN LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CREATING JOBS -- THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MENTION IS AROUND -- THE POINT INVOLVING TAXATION BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT -- THAT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED. I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THE CREDIT UNION'S RIGHTFULLY ARE TAX EXEMPT BECAUSE THEY EXISTS TO SERVE THEIR MEMBERS NOT TO MAKE A PROFIT FOR INVESTORS FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. THAT HAVE INVESTORS IS OUR BOTTOM LINE THEY ARE TAXED BUT NONPROFIT. ENTITIES GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES ARE NOT TAX BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE PUBLIC GOOD AS THEIR NUMBER ONE FIGHT DO SHERRY -- OBJECTIVE THIS BILL ESTABLISHES OUT REQUIRES PUBLIC BANKS TO HAVE A FIGHT JUDICIARY DUTY TO THE PUBLIC AND TO THE PUBLIC ASSETS AND THAT IS WHY WE TREAT THEM. IN THIS BILL LIKE A CREDIT UNION IF WALL STREET BANKS. WERE NOT BASED ON THE PROFIT MOTIVE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TAXES BUT THE FACT AMOUNT OF DATA THEY DO. THAT IS HOW WE STRUCTURE OUR TAX SYSTEM OUR IN OUR OUR COUNTRY SO JUST WANT TO REITERATE THOSE POINTS. I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT LOS ANGELES. TOOK IT THE TICKET TO THE PEOPLE FOR VOTE -- WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WHAT WAS THE? WE LOOK AT THE OTHER WAY STREET A SHOE STRING BUDGETS AND A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT -- WITH ALMOST NEAR ZERO DOLLARS GETS -- CLOSE 2405%. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD MOVE. AND SO NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE SAME LET'S HELP LET'S HELP WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS WANT. HELLO IT LOOKS LIKE YES SOME MEMORY THIS. YOU KNOW I DO WANT TO JUST -- SAY THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS BILL -- HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT -- IT CONTINUES IN THIS PROCESS I LIKE TO SEE IT EVOLVING I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ALL THE AMENDMENTS NO I THINK THE THE THE ONE WHICH MR CHIU SPOKE TO WAS THE ONE RELATED -- TO THE PUBLIC STUDY I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP ON YOU KNOW SORRY THAT WE DO THAT ANALYSIS BUT I CERTAINLY I'LL BE SUPPORTING LEGISLATION TODAY. BUT LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT MOVED TO THE PROCESS AND SEE YOU KNOW I MEAN I WAS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE YOU KNOW IT'S A BIG ISSUE. AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING -- FROM FROM -- ALL STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU TO BOTH -- AUTHORS FOR THE ONGOING DIALOGUE THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING OVER THIS TOPIC I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LOT MORE. ABOUT BANKING -- IN ALL THESE AREAS THAT ARE THERE. CERTAINLY -- THE THE BANKING IN THE MEMBERS THAT CAME THERE STARTED TO ADDRESS -- SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED. HOWEVER WE WE STILL AND WE HEAR IN THE PRESENTATION THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR CORPORATIONS VERSUS TAXPAYERS MONEY. WHEN TAXPAYERS MONEY IS AT RISK I THINK WE ALL OF US MORE OF A STRINGENT? ON OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RISK TOLERANCE IS THERE FOR ANY MUNICIPALITY -- THIS CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD AND AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING HARD ON IT. BUT IT BECOMES THAT RISK TOLERANCE THAT THE TAXPAYERS IN THE COMMUNITIES -- ARE SUFFERING. WHEREAS IN IN THE SHAREHOLDERS THEY'RE PUTTING IN PRIVATE DOLLARS THEY KNOW THE RISK TOLERANCE BEFORE THEY EVEN GET INTO IT SO IF A BANK. OR SOMETHING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS STARS TO HIT THESE DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS THEY START TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE MAKING CHANGES TO PROTECT. THAT ONGOING INVESTMENT THAT'S THERE AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITHIN THE PRIVATE SECTOR NOW THE GOVERNMENTAL SCHEME. THE GOVERNMENTAL SCHEME I KNOW I'VE ASK QUESTIONS AS FAR AS HOW MUCH WOULD BE THE THE CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR SOME OF THESE UP -- TO MANY CITIES ARE MUNICIPALITIES IT WILL MOVE FORWARD AND THEY FINANCIALLY SOUND AND I KNOW -- IT IS THAT WE DISCUSSED THAT AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF BANKING -- STARTS TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE PLANS WILL BE FORWARD ON A FIVE YEAR PRO FORMA -- SHEET ON IT PRO FORMAS ESTIMATE ADJUSTMENTS AND ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MOVE FORWARD. HOWEVER WE WE STILL LOOK AT THE INITIAL OUTLAY VERSUS PRIVATE DOLLARS AND INVESTORS COMING IN. AND MELISSA PARODIES WITH THE THE INFLUX OF TAXPAYERS MONEY BEING. IN THOSE AREAS IN THE SAFE CARS THAT ARE THERE. THERE STILL IS QUESTIONS THE THAT I DO HAVE -- YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE STAR UP OF USING TAXPAYERS DOLLARS TO FOR A START UP BUSINESS WHEN WE KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S A RISKY BUSINESS RIGHT LOANING MONEY OUT AND DOING THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. OR ELSE THERE WOULDN'T BE -- A RISK TOLERANCE AND SOME OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE SEEN IN HISTORY WITH -- SAVINGS AND LOANS OR THE BANKING INDUSTRY WHERE WE SEEN SOME BAIL OUT FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE TO THE BANKING INDUSTRY HAS SOME OF THESE AREAS. SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT. THERE'S NO RISK TO IT THERE IS RISK TOLERANCE TO IT SO NOT KNOWING WHAT THAT RISK TOLERANCE IS ON WE CONTINUE. TO BE OPEN TO DIALOGUE THAT THAT'S THAT'S THERE AND AS WELL AS MOVING FORWARD AND SEEN A LOT OF THE SUPPORT IT'S THERE. BUT YET THERE STILL IS SOME SOME HARD QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED -- EVEN AT THIS POINT NIGHT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ALL THESE QUESTIONS AND AND TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME IS JUST A COMPLEX ISSUE. AND HOPEFULLY AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD WE'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY ON IT THAT WE WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND TO IT. BUT TODAY I'M IN A RESERVE MY VOTE -- TO NOT SUPPORT THIS WILL BE. FOR HEY OTHER COMMENTS OKAY -- IN A TEMAS XIN THE SECOND. A MOTION AND A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M I'M AT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WILL BUT I DO WANT TO CLEAR UP -- WHEN I HAD TALKED ABOUT BANKS -- IN COMPETITION I WAS I DIDN'T MENTION PLEASE DON'T REMEMBER MENTIONING COMMUNITY -- BANKS OR CREDIT UNIONS -- WHEN I WHEN I START ABOUT THE BANKS I WAS SEEING IN MY MIND THE BIG CORPORATE BANKS -- AND SAID THAT RATHER THAN THE SAY CORPORATE NAMES BUT I CAN -- AND LOOK THIS IS A SERIOUS POSSIBLE I ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATIONS BACK AND FORTH. BUT IT'S LIKE ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION I MEAN HOW MANY OF US OF SAT BEFORE COMMITTEE AND SAID HEY I NEED TIME TO WORK ON THAT AND THIS IS WHAT EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS YOU NEED TIME TO WORK ON IT. AND A AND MOVE IT -- FOR A AND IT'S IN BROKEN TEAM TO TAKE A LOOK AT WAYS TO PROTECT -- THE PUBLIC DOLLAR -- AND PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AT SOME POINT IN TIME A PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS MY CALLING IT SAID IN THE LAST MEETING -- WITH SOMETHING ABSURD THAT SHOULD EXIST AND NOW WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND I CAN GO ON WITH DIFFERENT PUBLIC -- GOODS IN AGENCIES -- AND THIS IS JUST A STEP FORWARD IN IN THAT SAME FRAME OF THOUGHT THAT WOULD THERE IS POSSIBILITY THAT TO HAVE A PUBLIC BANK -- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THROWING OUT DOLLARS AND AND SPENDING BUT THERE IS A SERIOUS PLANET YOU GOTTA PUT IN PLACE. YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH THE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT OU HAVE TO HAVE INSURANCE -- FDIC INSURANCE -- AND WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION TO ENSURE THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE A ARE -- WELL KEPT -- AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO PRESS OUR COMMUNITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FROM I BOUGHT THIS IS -- I WOULD CONSIDER A HISTORIC VOTE TO KEEP MOVING THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION. FOR AND I HOPE A MOST OF YOU -- WILL LAND ON THE ON THE US SIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS AND BASICALLY WANT TO THANK -- MISTER ROBERTS AND EACH OF YOU WHO HAVE ENGAGE WITH US VERY DEEPLY ON THIS AND AND I WANT TO JUST MAKE THREE POINTS THE FIRST IS AROUND RICK'S RISK TOLERANCE. THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK ABOUT QUITE A BIT BECAUSE AS AUTHORS OF THIS WE DO NOT WANT TO SET UP A SCENARIO FOR ANY THESE PUBLIC BANKS TO FAIL. AND THIS IS WHY THE REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL ARE SO ONEROUS THAT IT ACTUALLY WILL BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANY LOCAL JURISDICTION TO MEET ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS TO BE ABLE TO CHARTER A PUBLIC BANK. AND THAT IS INTENTIONAL BECAUSE AS YOU SAID WE DO NOT WANT TO SET UP A SITUATION TO FAIL. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT I WOULD NOT OF INTRODUCED THIS BILL. IF. ELEVEN OF THE ELEVEN MEMBERS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF MY JURISDICTION HAD NOT PUT THEIR NAME TO SAME WE MIGHT NEED TO DO THIS. AFTER. DEEP ANALYSIS THAT DID SHOW. THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF CAPITAL. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS TO GET THESE UP AND RUNNING BUT EVEN WITH THAT RISK PROFILE. ALL OF MY LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE ASKED ME AND ASKED US TO MOVE FOR THE BILL TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO DO THIS. THE SECOND THING I WANT TO SAY IS I KNOW THE BANKING LOBBYIST LIKE TO TALK ABOUT PUTTING TAXPAYER DOLLARS AT RISK. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT TAXPAYER DOLLARS HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT IN RISK RIGHT NOW WITH THE STATUS QUO. SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF CALIFORNIA PACKED TAXPAYER FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN THESE BANKS. AND THERE VESTED IN INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE FAILING OUR CONSUMERS THAT OUR FAMILY ARE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE FAILING OR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE FAILING OUR STUDENTS THERE PUT INSTANCE INTO INSTITUTIONS. THAT ARE OUR THAT ARE INVESTING IN GUN MANUFACTURERS AND FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES WITH UNFAIR PRACTICES. AND I JUST THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A DIFFERENT OPTION. THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS I DO KNOW THIS IS A NEW CONCEPT AND IT TAKES. TIME FOR FOLKS TO WRAP THEIR BRAINS AROUND IT AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS IS A HARD THING TO THINK ABOUT IT'S BEEN SOMETHING I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THERE WAS A TIME. IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN WE DID NOT HAVE. A PUBLIC HOUSING SYSTEM BECAUSE AND IT IT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THE PRIVATE HOUSING SYSTEM BROKE DOWN. THERE WAS A TIME WE DIDN'T NEED A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM BUT THE PRIVATE HEALTH SYSTEM BROKE DOWN THERE'S A TIME WE DIDN'T NEED PUBLIC TRANSIT. BUT THE PRIVATE TRANSIT SYSTEM BROKE DOWN AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS OUR WALL STREET BANKING SYSTEM UNFORTUNATELY HAS FAILED US. AND WE NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE OVERNIGHT WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING LET'S ESTABLISH THE RULES. LET'S MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THE RISK AND MOVE IT FOR I VERY MUCH RESPECT EVERYONE'S PERSPECTIVE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS QUESTION. I HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I HOPE THAT FOR FOLKS WHO ARE NOT PERSUADED TODAY WE CAN PERSUADE YOU OVER TIME. THANK YOU. THE LADY ON THE PHONE BOB PROCESS YEAH -- SHE SAID IN THIS POLICY -- TWO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF FARMS FOR OUR THIS IS KATIE MAY AND HOW MUCH OF THIS POLICY ENERGY ASIANS AND THE STAFF GOING. FOR A LOOSE. THIS IS WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MADE SURE THAT THOSE THAT OR UNDERSTAND AGAIN A BUT YOU ALSO CAN. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT -- FORWARD PUTTING THAT MONEY INTO THE SIDE OF A THANK YOU. YOUR CLOTHES OKAY -- SO THANK YOU TO THE AUTHORS AND THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS. ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THE POOR THE NINETIES ANOTHER LOCAL AGENCY MORE AGENCIES MORE RECENTLY QUESTIONABLE INVESTMENTS CAN LEAD TO DIRE CONSEQUENCE CONSEQUENCES. WHEN LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY? SERVICES ARE CUT. JOBS ARE LOST EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND PENSIONS HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO COME UNDER ATTACK. ENSURING THAT LOCAL AGENCIES EMPLOYEES TAXPAYERS ARE PROTECTED IS OF THE MONTH OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE FOR THOSE OF US IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ENSURING **** THROUGH FDIC AND HAVING A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF POTENTIAL FISCAL IMPACTS ON LOCAL AGENCIES IT'S CRITICAL. BEFORE DEDICATING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES. A PUBLIC TRANSPARENT STUDY IS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION BEFORE LOCAL OFFICIALS OFFICIALS MAKE A DECISION TO APPLY FOR THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC BANK. THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO MAKE FDIC INSURANCE AND THE PROBLEM PRELIMINARY STUDY A REQUIREMENT. A REQUIREMENTS. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE SUPPORTERS HAVE CONSISTENTLY HOW TO VALUE. SAID A VALUE OF PUBLIC BANKS. IS THAT LOCAL AGENCIES WILL DIVEST FROM CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. YET THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO LIMIT PUBLIC BANKS POTENTIAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. I MUST WONDER OUT LOUD IF THE AUTHORS MAY WISH TO IDENTIFY RESTRICTIONS ON PUBLIC BANKS. JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT. WITH THAT BEING SAID I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY -- AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. SECRETARY TAKE THE ROLE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY HI LACKEY. LACKEY NO BLOOM. BLOOM HI. BOERNER HORVATH RAMOS. RAMOS NOT VOTING THREE OF US. THREE OF US I ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVAS I VOEPEL VOEPEL NOW. THREE FOUR IT'S WE NEED ONE MORE VOTE THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. FOR HEY. YEAH WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT ONE LET'S SEE. THERE'S A LOT OF OUR NEXT WILL BE ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN TWELVE FORTY EIGHT EDUARDO GARCIA IS BILL PRESENTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU A MADAM CHAIR WE'RE HERE TO PRESENT AB -- TWELVE FORTY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA -- WHO WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS? THANK YOU IN AB TWELVE FORTY A WILL PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE THE REDEVELOPMENT REHABILITATION FACILITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BY ATTRACTING INVESTMENT FROM SMALL AND MID SIDE. MANUFACTURES. THIS BILL ULTIMATELY WILL ALLOW THE CITY OR COUNTY TO OFFER A PARTIAL PROPERTY TAX REBATE. FOR QUALIFIED MANUFACTURING FACILITIES LOCATED IN THEIR JURISDICTION THEN INVEST IN EXCESS OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE MANUFACTURE ENTERING INTO A COMMUNITY AGREEMENT. THIS COMMUNITY AGREEMENT MUST SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF TYPES OF JOBS TO BE CREATED BY THE QUALIFIED MANUFACTURING FACILITY. THE COMPENSATION RANGES FOR EACH JOB T&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND THE COURAGE TO BE&lt;/c&gt; PROVIDED BY AN EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN. THIS WILL ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT ANOTHER TOOL TO BETTER TARGET THE SMALLER MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE ATTRACTIVE IN ADDITION TO THE LARGER MANUFACTURING FACILITIES TARGETED UNDER THE ALREADY AUTHORIZED CAPITAL INVESTMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY THE AUTHOR UNDERSTANDS THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS REGARDING THE NEED FOR LANGUAGE REGARDING WHICH AREAS OF A CITY OR COUNTY. WOULD BE ALLOWED UNDER THIS BILL. WE WILL LOOK AT POSSIBLE CLARIFICATIONS AND DEFINITIONS THAT MAY APPLY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE BILL TRULY TARGETS REVITALIZATION. I ALSO HAVE JUROR OUT C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; WE&lt;/c&gt;</u> CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND GIRL BOX SO -- TO THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS. INTEREST THEY WANT TO PRESENT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE. AS WELL AS A MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA FOR CARING THIS BILL AND SOME OF THEM RAMOS FOR STEPPING IN TODAY. MY NAME IS TRAIL COOK I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF AB -- TWELVE FORTY EIGHT AS A MEMBER RAMOS MENTIONED BY THE BILL IS MODELED ON THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAM A BILL THAT. PASSED I AM WAS RECENTLY EXTENDED OUR LAST YEAR WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. I LIKE THAT PROGRAM. THE THE TRIP FOR THE TARGET A REVITALIZATION PRO INVESTMENT PROGRAM A. B. TWELVE FORTY EIGHT OPERATE ON A WIN WIN WIN MODEL -- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WINS BECAUSE THEY GET NEW THEY GET TO ATTRACT NEW INVESTMENT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE GARNERED WITHOUT THE PROGRAM -- THE MANUFACTURE WINS BECAUSE THEY GET A CUT IN COSTS FOR THEIR OPERATIONS AND THE COMMUNITY WINS BECAUSE THEY GET A DIRECT -- BENEFIT. DUE -- TO THE COMMUNITY SERVICES PAYMENT EITHER THE MANUFACTURER MAKES IT FUNDS A PROGRAM IN THEIR COMMUNITY [inaudible] SO. THE MODEL IN THE CITY IS GREAT IN THE IN THE CAPITAL -- IN BEST MINUTES AND PROGRAM IS GREAT HOWEVER AT THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED SINCE THE CIP WAS ENACTED IN IN THE NINETIES -- SINCE THIS IT WAS ENACTED MANUFACTURING HAS GOTTEN LEANER IT'S GOTTEN SMALLER BUT MORE PRODUCTIVE IT'S FASTER -- AND WE CAN PRODUCE A GREAT MANY GOODS IN FACILITIESTHAT WE COULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE -- BEFORE -- SO NOW WE SEE MANUFACTURING MOVING INTO URBAN CENTERS INTO COMMERCIAL CENTERS -- DOWNTOWN TO DISTRICTS -- AT A DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS IN PLACES WE COULDN'T BEFORE AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE ARE REVITALIZING COMMUNITIES AND DRAWING NEW INVESTMENT. THE GROWTH IN MANUFACTURING IS IN THE RANGE OF INVESTMENTS WHEN FIVE AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE MEGA INVESTMENT THAT THE SET WAS INTENDED TO ATTRACT OF A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE -- IS LESS THAN IN CALIFORNIA. BY COMPARISON INVESTMENTS WITH THE FIVE AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR RANGE ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED BY THAT INVESTMENT IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT CREATED BY INVESTMENT OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. SO THE TARGETED REVITALIZATION IN. CENTER PROGRAM THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT IS REALLY GEARED TOWARD PROVIDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH AN EFFECTIVE TOOL THAT WILL ATTRACT MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT WHERE IT IS TODAY. AS AN EXAMPLE -- WE CAN POINT TO A MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT IS IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA IS DISTRICT IN RALEIGH -- THERE THERE WAS A FACILITY THAT SHUT DOWN WAS RAN BY A NATIONAL FOOD -- PROCESSING CHAIN -- AFTER IT LEFT WE SAW THE CITY HAD A NEARLY 25% POVERTY RATES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A SMALLER SCALED MANUFACTURER MAKING CRAFT BEEF PRODUCTS TOOK OVER IN OLD FACILITY -- AND AFTER INVESTING IN MAKING INVESTMENTS OF FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THEY CREATED SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE JOBS AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AFTER THAT INVESTMENT WE'VE SEEN FOLLOW UP INVESTMENT IN THE FEED INDUSTRY IN THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY ALL OF THESE -- SUBSEQUENT INSULAR INDUSTRIES THAT SUPPORT -- BEEF MANUFACTURING AND SO GROWTH COMES WITH MANUFACTURING COLUMNS THE CHALLENGE AT THAT FACILITY FACED WAS THAT THEY DID NOT HAD THAT THEY NEEDED SUPPORT MENTAL FINANCING INCENTIVES FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THEY WORKED WITH THEIR LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER -- COMMUNITY AND REGIONAL INVESTMENT SERVICES BUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAD TO DO A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FACILITY COULD BE SUPPORTED BEFORE COULD BE UP AND RUNNING. SO THE PROGRAM A. B. TWELVE FORTY IS TO PROVIDE ANOTHER TOOL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THAT TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR THOSE REASONS WERE ASKING FOR YOUR AYE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- I I'M EXCITED TO TO BE HERE THIS EVENING BECAUSE I I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC TOLD MY NAME'S ROBERT BURRIS. I'M NOT GO BACK TO THE HOTEL -- AND THEN I'D SORRY FOR THAT. BUT I DO REMEMBER. I DO REPRESENTS KHALLID -- AN ORGANIZATION OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS -- AS WELL AS THE SOLANO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION -- MY DAY TO DAY JOB IS COMPETING FOR THIS JOB FOR THE STATE -- AND CREATING HELPING TO CREATE JOBS AND INVESTMENT -- THIS IS A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ADD ANOTHER TOOL -- TO COMPETING WITH OTHER STATES AND SOMETIMES OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THOSE SAME JOBS AND IT IS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT -- THIS -- TOOL WILL ALLOW US. TO TARGET THE TYPES OF MANUFACTURES -- THAT THAT WE ARE SAYING IN TERMS OF DEMAND IN THE STATE ESPECIALLY -- OUR TARGET AREA -- AND CLUSTER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY AND WE THINK THIS IS VERY SIMILAR THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- IS IN FOOD AND BEVERAGE LIFE SCIENCES AND ADVANCED MATERIALS -- WE SEE THOSE AS AS CRITICAL FACTORS IN GROWTH AND THOSE THAT REQUIRE THAT SIZE OF A MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND WHAT WE SEE IS A SWEET SPOT. AS ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTY THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. ROUGHLY FIFTY EMPLOYEES TO FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THAT'S THE BULK OF OUR PROSPECTS PROSPECTS ARE WHAT WE CALL COMPANIES. AND INVESTORS THAT ARE WANTING TO GET INVOLVED IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE AND WE WORK WITH ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. WE THINK THAT -- THIS BELT REALLY FIT STOCK MARKET VERY WELL TARGETED VERY WELL AND LOWERS THE THRESHOLD -- THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE STEP TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT THOSE COMPANIES. AND IT'S A VERY FUNCTIONAL PROGRAM AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE IT. ONE OF THE THE REASONS THAT THAT IT'S BECOME SO COMPETITIVE -- IN THE IN THE MARKETPLACE ROUTE THE COUNTRY. AS THAT ARE SURROUNDING STATES ROUGHING VERY LARGE INCENTIVES TO THESE COMPANIES. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE? A GOOD PLACE FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE GROWING WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO EXPAND INTO AND FOR US TO RETAIN THOSE COMPANIES HERE. THE REASON THAT WE CHOOSE THOSE INDUSTRY CLUSTERS OF THREE THAT I MENTIONED WERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE WE LEAD THE NATION AND INNOVATION. AND MANY OF THOSE COMPANIES ARE GROWING IN OUR MOST INNOVATIVE LOCATIONS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN THEY GET INTO THE MANUFACTURING STAGE OR WHEN THEY WANTED THEIR MANUFACTURING. THERE'S A PLACE FOR THEM IN THE STATE. AND THAT'S ONE SECONDLY WE REALLY WANT TO BE COMPETITIVE WHEN COMPANIES ARE LOOKING THROUGHOUT THE NATION EVEN INTERNATIONALLY TO LOCATE THEIR NEXT LOCATION. OFTENTIMES THEY LOOK AT REASONS LIKE SKILLED LABOR LOCATION THEIR CUSTOMER BASE OR SUPPLIER BASE OR WHERE THEIR HEADQUARTERS RELOCATED. TO LAND THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES WE HAVE ADVANTAGE IN MANY OF THOSE FACTORS BUT OFTEN TIMES THEY CAN'T USE OTHER LOCATIONS AND STILL OPERATE WITHIN CALIFORNIA. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COMPETITIVE AGAINST OTHER STATES THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE SAME COMPANIES -- AT ALL LEAVE IT THERE -- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE BUT FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE -- ANY EMOTION. WHO? I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU A MANAGER COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- AND ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA MYSELF WE ASK YOUR RIVAL.
