OUR STREETS IN OUR JAILS AND HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS- OUR STATE'S STRAIN MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HONESTLY- WILL BE ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE- AND WE'LL TRY AND IN A VERY NEGATIVE DIRECTION. WITHOUT HEALTH CARE WORKERS WITH GREAT WORK- TO TRY TO SURE PEOPLE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE AND UTILIZE INSURANCE FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDING FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE WHETHER IN OUR SCHOOLS OR ELSEWHERE- BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE WORK FORCE. TO DELIVER. THOSE SERVICES OR YOU'RE NEVER GONNA WE'RE NEVER GONNA CHIEF OUR GOALS.

JONATHAN PORTEUS THE CEO OF WELL SPACE IN SOCCER.

ONLY ONE- ONE THIRD OF THAT CALIFORNIANS WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS NOT. THE MISSUS THEY NEED. BECAUSE OF THE COVERT NINETY CAN MAKE WE ARE WE- HEALTHCARE WORKERS RESIGNING IN DROVES AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS SKYROCKETING. AND AS A RESULT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SHORTAGE HAS GONE FROM CHALLENGE TO CRISIS. WITHOUT ESSENTIAL WORKERS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO CARE SERVICES ARE DROPPING FACILITIES ARE CLOSING AND THE SICKEST AMONG US ARE CYCLING BETWEEN THE STREET JAIL AND EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND AS WE SINK DEEPER INTO THIS CRISIS STATE IS ON THE VERGE OF MONUMENTAL AND INCREDIBLY NEEDED REFORMS WITH CATALAN THE USE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AND THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS LINE.

PEOPLE WILL FALL EVEN SICKER AND IN THE MOST TRAGIC OF CASES PEOPLE WILL DIE. LEGISLATION IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO STABILIZE AND REBUILD OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS.

IT'S TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH OKAY LET'S BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON SB NINE SIXTY FOUR. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR RIGHT CENTER WE ARE I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD REPRESENT A RURAL AREA EVERY TIME I GO OUT TO TWENTY NINE PALMS OR- THE BAD CHINA LAKE NAVAL AIR WARFARE CENTER WHERE VETERANS ARE VALIANTLY SERVING OUR COUNTRY- ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THEY HAVE. IS- IS THAT THEY HAVE TO DRIVE THREE HOURS AND FIVE HOURS DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY'RE AT. TO LOS ANGELES TO GET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND IT'S FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. AND SO- A LOT OF TIMES THEY DON'T GET SERVICES. SO MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ISSUES GOING ON DRIVE FIVE HOURS SEE A DOCTOR CAN'T SEE A DOCTOR IF YOU WAITED ALL DAY. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SO I APPLIED YOUR BILL. I DO HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH- AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE DISRESPECTFUL IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM BUT WHY ARE WE DOING A STUDY WHERE WE JUST IMPLEMENTING THIS PIECE OF% LEGISLATION BECAUSE- WE ALL KNOW WE HEAR IT FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE DESPERATELY. NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED SPECIFICALLY AFTER COVE IT AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS GONE ON THE LAST TWO YEARS- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL AT THIS GREAT STEP FORWARD BUT WHY ARE WE JUST MAKING THIS. A PIECE LEGISLATION THAT SAYS WE WILL DO THIS TO YOU TO BE CLEAR YOU'RE THE ONE I CHATTED BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE STUDY. THE SEATTLE THIS IS A PRACTICE. OF THE BILL ITSELF IS NOT A STUDY IT DOES A LOT OF THINGS BUT- MY UNDERSTANDING IF YOU'RE- CONCERNED A CONCERN THAT I SHARE. WITH MILITARY I'M SORRY EXPANDED ON THAT I APOLOGIZE. SO THERE IS FOR VETERANS ON THIS COMMITTEE- FOR VETERANS EACH ONE OF US HAD NMOS WE SERVED THE UNITED STATES MILITARY- WE HAVE THAT SKILL SET- THAT WE LEARN FROM THE MILITARY WE SHOULD BILL TRANSFER. TWO CALIPHS. I MEAN THE OTHER STATES WHY CAN'T WE JUST MAKE THE VETERANS IT HAD THE SKILL SET OR CUT OR INDIVIDUALS WHO COME FROM OTHER STATES. NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENT AGAIN SO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL HELP YEAH SO- I DO SO YOUR CONCERNS I UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH IS A CONCERN I SHARE IS THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE. WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO IF SOCIAL WORK OR- OR WHATEVER THE QUESTION MIGHT BE. WHO ARE TOTALLY QUALIFIED TO PERFORM SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA YES SIR BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET. A JOB RE. TRAINING CERTIFIED AS IF YOU WERE JUST LIKE COMING OUT OF COLLEGE FRESH- WITH NO EXPERIENCE. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW- AND I- SHARE THAT. CONCERN AND THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE STOP. I'M VERY FIRST OF ALL TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE HERE ARE A TO PROP TO THE FULL. EXTENT OF THEIR TRAINING AND ARE NOT BEING LEGALLY RESTRICTED. FROM PRACTICING IN AREAS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FULLY TRAINED TO PRACTICE AND- AND THEN ALSO TO LOOK AT- RETIRED. PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM OUT OF STATE AND ARE THERE SOME SITUATIONS WHERE WE CAN HAVE SOMEONE TO SORT OF WAVE AND WITH MUCH MORE LIMITED- TRAINING- EXAMINATION BE ABLE TO. BE CERTIFIED TO PRACTICE HERE I SUPPORT THAT- AND- AND THAT'S WHAT THE STUDY WITH THEM I UNDERSTAND YOU WOULD PREFER THAT SORT OF A STUDY WE JUST. DO IT- AND THERE MIGHT RESPONSES TO FOLD- THERE ARE SOME COMPLEXITIES ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME COMPLEXITIES ABOUT DIFFERENT. KINDS OF SCOPE IN MAKING SURE THAT SOMEONE ACTUALLY DID RECEIVE THE TRAINING. IN A PARTICULAR AREA SO- I THINK STUYING IT MAKES SENSE. BUT ALSO JUST TO BE A BLIND AS CENTER ROTH KNOWS MORE THAN MOST- SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS ALWAYS. ONE OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUE THIS LEGISLATURE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NURSE PRACTITIONER AND- NURSE PRACTITIONER LEGISLATION IT TOOK WHAT TEN YEARS YEARS TO GET THAT. PASSES A HUGE PIPE TO NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIANS. AND YEAH IT. HAPPENED. START DO I AND I STUDY IT'S GONNA BE MY SMOOTHER THINK RATHER THAN SOMEONE TO INTRODUCING A BILL SO I WANTED THIS SO I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT PEOPLE AT THE DRIVE FOUR HOURS AND FIVE HOURS- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ALSO DOES FOCUS THIS WILL BRING RESOURCES I BELIEVE IN TO RURAL AND LIKE COMMUNITIES JUST TO LIVE. AREA OR I TO HAVE EASIER ACCESS TO GUNS ALSO I SURE YOUR CONCERN BUT THAT'S I THINK THE NINE AMIK THAT WERE DEALING WITH I APPRECIATE YOUR- COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE IT IS. YES STUDY BACK SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN UR COMMUNITY I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE STEPS TO MOVE FORWARD I REALLY DO WISH- WE COULD JUST COME TOGETHER AND NO MATTER WHO'S BEATING DOWN OUR DOOR STEP WE CAN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR CONSTITUENTS AND I KNOW THAT'S DIFFICULT- DURING THIS BUILDING BUT I APPRECIATE YOU DOING. ONE THING JUST TO BE CLEAR IN TERMS AWAITING IT- YOUR TO THAT FOR THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE YEAH. FOR THE OTHER A- BILL THOSE ARE GOING TO AFFECT. YOU KNOW JANUARY THIRTY FIRST ACTUALLY SOONER BECAUSE I THINK. THIS IS ULTIMATELY CAN BE A LOT OF BUDGET WORKING CENTER EGGMAN IS DOING A LOT ABOUT WORK. AS WELL AND REALLY LEADING ON THE BUDGET SIDE. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SUBMITTING A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET REQUEST. RELATED TO THIS BILL AND THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET. SO THERE WILL BE I THINK. I'M ASPECTS OF THIS BILL THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE. IN PLACE UPON A SIGNATURE IN THE BUDGET. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU AGAIN. OKAY THANK YOU. NEXTWE HAVE CENTER RUBIO FOLLOWED BY CENTER ROCKS AND THEN CENTER EGGMAN OKAY. THE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS ALREADY MENTIONED THERE IS A HIGH NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND YOU KNOW DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE PAST TWO YEARS PIEPER EVEN A PROFESSION THAT SOCK CLEAR NOT ONLY IN THAT SPACE EDUCATION AND OTHER AREAS BUT WE DEFINITELY- ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF BARRIERS SAD- THAT WE HAVE THE CONTENT BUT THEN I THINK THAT. WE HAVE TO DO BETTER TRAINING COURAGE PEOPLE TO JOIN THE WORK FORCE OF WE WANT TO DELIVER THE SERVICES WE NEED HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEN WE NEED TO DO BETTER TO ENCOURAGE THAT OUR FIRST TO COME FORWARD. WE SHIP FACT THAT DOC. YOUR THERE'S TO THE COMPANY NINE OTHER SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE AND SO GATHERING DATA AND MAKING SURE THAT. THERE IS A STEADY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT SO WHEN YOU DO GET IT DONE IT'S DONE AND THE RIGHT WAY SO NOT ONLY DO I WANT. TO- AS A CO AUTHOR BUT I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WHEN APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. OKAY THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY US AND RUBIO- SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER CURE YOU KNOW IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE- MY PREDECESSOR CERTAINLY AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE I'VE BEEN ON BOARD WE HAVE OF FOCUSED A LOT ON PORTABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO MOVE FROM STATE TO STATE IN CALIFORNIA- I PRESUME IN THIS AREA AS IN MANY AREAS. HAS SOME HISTORICAL REQUIREMENTS SOME OF WHICH CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE SENSE SOME OF WHICH DO NOT. THAT WE EXPLORE OF INCLUDING- THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFECT YOUR PRINT CHECKS AND MANY OF THESE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA- ELECTRONIC- LESSCANCER NOT OF. ACCEPTABLE IF YOU'RE COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATE YOU FREQUENTLY HAVE TO DO A HARD CARD WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT. ARE FINGERPRINT CARD CAUSES. I WAS NOT PARTICULARLY AND SPECIFICALLY AWARE OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT WE DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR OR TWO TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES WE HAVE A- SPENDING BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS DO WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO. TO DO ONGOING SUNSET REVIEW AND CLEAN UP SUNSET REVIEW AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO OBVIOUSLY I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SENATOR WIENER. TO TRY AND ADDRESS OF THE MORE EMERGENT ISSUES- SOONER THAN. THEN THE COMPLETION OF THE- THE BADLY NEEDED STUDY SO JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT WERE ON IT THÀNH WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE ISSUE THAT SENATOR LIMÓN REYES TO. A WHILE AGO WHICH SEEMS- ON USUAL TO ME SO THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- BAKER SIR SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATE WINNER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I LOOK FOR TO OUR ON GOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AS YOU SAY VERY CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE. THE SEVERITY OF OUR WORKFORCE CRISIS ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- I HAD MY STUFF LOOK REAL QUIK AT ABOUT THAT ISSUE DID THE BBS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH AND- I'VE ALSO. IN ADDITION SENATOR TRY TO MY TIME BOTH THE ON BMP. TO DO SOME OF THESE WORK FORCE ISSUES AND- AND SCOPE ISSUES ARE DIFFICULT AND HOPEFULLY THIS HOPEFULLY THE CRISIS IS SUCH THAT WE CAN ALL. DECIDE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TOGETHER TO TAKE CAR OF THIS. AND I THINK I THINK BELIEVE THIS IS DOUBLE REFERRED BECAUSE I. ONE OF MY ISSUES IS ALSO MORE% AROUND THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT OF IT- ESPECIALLY FOR SOCIAL WORK WE HAVE A- A NATIONAL. TO EVERY EVERY SCHOOL WAIT WHEN MSW IS MORE VALUABLE SOMEONE SAY. THE OTHER DEGREES BECAUSE OF YOUR DEGREE IN COUNSELING SOMETHING ELSE NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THAT IS. IF YOU GET AN MSW THAT AROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THAT IS AND THERE'S ESTABLISH CRITERIA NO MATTER WHAT STATE YOU'RE IN IF YOU'RE IN. YOUR EUROPE. OR FEAR IN. MINNESOTA OR CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET BE A LICENSED. OR ACCREDITED. PROGRAM SO THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY ISSUES WITH. PORTABILITY ACROSS. THE STATE SET THERE IS- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON. IS THIS ISSUE OF OUR POLICIES PUSHING FOR MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN OUR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT I BELIEVE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS A LOT OF OUR GRADUATE PROGRAMS HAVE REDUCED BECAUSE THEY'RE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO ADMIT. AND OUR BACHELOR'S PROGRAM SOME GROUND. WHICH ISN'T MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE SO. IN MY IN MY SMALL AMOUNT OF RESEARCH I'VE DONE ON IT SCHOOL THAT USED TO ADMIT COHORTS OF THREE HUNDRED MSW ARE NOW ADMITTING COURTS ONE HUNDRED IN SIZES AND SO THEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE BACHELORS LEVEL PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAM TO GO TO. AND THEY END UP GOING SOMEWHERE ONLINE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY GETTING INTO OFTENTIMES AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THEIR LICENSE. AND CREATING A LOT MORE ISSUES SO IT REALLY I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME COORDINATION BETWEEN THE C. ISSUES IN THE UC'S. ON THE SLOTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THE STUDENTS. THANK YOU IF I COULD JUST SAY- YOU KNOW CENTER A MAN SPECIFIC ON HIS BILL TO I KNOW IT'S ALSO BUDGET ISSUE. IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC THOUGHTS YOU HAVE ABOUT HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS THAT MORE M. S. W.'S- BUT IF THEY'RE WAYS WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE IN THE BILL WE REALLY WALK. YOUR THE SPACE FOR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS NEED IN ORDER FOR SOMEONE TO GET LICENSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE POSTGRADUATE. SUPERVISED HOURS. AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE ISSUES OF A LOT OF NONPROFITS AREN'T ABLE TO HIRE SUPERVISE THAT SOMEONE WITH A LICENSE. WHO CAN SUPERVISED. PEOPLE ALL KINDS OF NONPROFITS BUT WHAT WOMAN SHELTERS EVERYWHERE SO. IT MIGHT JUST BE ANOTHER COMPONENT WE THINK ABOUT. LIKE A UNIT OF SUPERVISORS REVIEW JUST. ONE SUPER. CARE FOR FOLKS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. C. NINE- SO SIR WIENER PRESHEAF BRAIN IS BUILT ITS- QUITE CALM FOR ACTUALLY TO OF LOS PARTS APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH HER TO ME TAKING AMENDMENTS- AND ACTUALLY THERE'S A CON ABOUT THIS IT IS GOING TO BE HEARD AND ACTUALLY AND EDUCATION COMMITTEE NEXT TONIGHT'S THEMSELVES CERTAINLY WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE A BITE AT THAT AS WELL AND- I GUESS I WILL ALSO HERE IT IS WHAT I WILL ALSO BE THERE. AGAIN. WITH THAT- SO AGAIN THE REAL APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS IT IS IMPORTANT WE FELT THAT BEHAVIOR HEALTH PIPELINE. DO I TO KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE. MANY OTHER PROPOSED WHICH I YOU'RE TRYING YOUR CALL. WITH BUDGET FOR. SO PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR'S AT CETERA THAT WE NEED TO COORDINATE ALL THESE PIECES TO. BUT WITH THAT- CERTAINLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WHICH IS LIKE THE CLOSEST. I THINK THAT THIS. HERE IS CALLER. SHOW THAT THIS IS LIKE TO. OF MIND. NOT JUST HERE BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW. THAT THEIR PEOPLE EVEN IN ARE REALLY URBANIZED AREAS THAT MADE YOU WANT TO SEE A THERAPIST. AND STRUGGLE TO FIND A THERAPIST WHO HAS AVAILABLE SLOTS EVEN IF THE PERSON CAN PAY. A LOT AND DON'T TAKE INSURANCE BECAUSE INSURANCE DOESN'T REIMBURSE THE WAY SHOULD JUST FINDING SOMEONE PURCHASE BASIC NOT FOR CRISIS CARE JUST FOR BASIC. HAVING SOME THE PRESS A REALLY- A HUGE AND I'M SO. EVEN ON SIDE WE WERE. A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS OR EXPERIENCING I AM HAPPY THAT SOCIETY AT LARGE IN THE BODY POLITIC OR FINALLY FOCUSING ON THIS AND RECOGNIZING POST CODE OF IT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO SEVERE. HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION TODAY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK NOT JUST ON THIS BILL BECAUSE LIKE I'M GOING TO A FAMILY BILLS AND BUDGET PROPOSALS AND SURVEY GROUP OUT FOR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO.

FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE HEALTH COMMITTEE CONTROLS FOR THEIR SYSTEM THEIR SYSTEM FOR THE BILL AND ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS REGARDING- CLARIFYING THE ROLE THE CALIFORNIA PART PUBLIC HEALTH. SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE IS A BILL BY STUDENTS FOR STUDENTS TO ENSURE THEIR RIGHT TO QUALITY IN PERSON EDUCATION. THE CIVIC PLEA SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP OPING NINETEEN TESTING PLANS THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE. ENSURES THAT SCHOOLS PRESCHOOLS AND ONSITE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND CHILD CARE CENTERS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THEIR TESTING PLANS. CVHS WORK THROUGH THAT THE PANDEMIC TO ENSURE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE GOOD TESTING GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT BUT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO REQUIREMENT FOR A PLAN. CASE SEARCHES IN A COVERT THREATEN SCHOOLS WHEN THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO TEST RECOVER NINETEEN AND PARENTS NEED TO KNOW IF THERE IF CASES ARE SPREADING AND THEIR CHILD SCHOOLS. WELL BACK SEIZE OUR GREATEST- SUPPORT AND STUFF FIGHT AGAINST A COVER NINETEEN WE NEED MORE SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT FUTURE SCHOOL CLOSURES AND CASE SEARCHES.

FOR CHILDREN FORTY FIVE TO FOURTEEN END OF PEOPLE FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS BETWEEN JANUARY MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FACT THAT OVER ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN.

FACT SPORADIC SCHOOL CLOSURES HAVE TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT TOLL ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WILL BE STUDENTS PARENTS AND TEACHERS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. TO READ THE CYCLE SCHOOL OPENINGS AND CLOSURES WE MUST DEVELOP COUNTRY TESTING PLANS TO ENSURE ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE IN PERSON LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. THE CURRENT PATCHWORK OF TESTING REGIMENS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAVE SHOWN THAT SCHOOLS WITHOUT FREQUENT TESTING. SUFFER OF WINDOWS COMPARED TO THOSE WITH CONCRETE TESTING PLANS. TO REMAIN OPEN AND SAFE. IN THE STUDY OF OVER TWO HUNDRED CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE FOUNDED ON SAKE OF IN NINETEEN TESTING CONTRIBUTES TO THE SAFETY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DO HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS OR HAVE A COMMENT THAT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FIRST I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO BRING- THE GOOD DOCTOR WHO LED THE TESTIMONY UP TO THE pOF QUESTIONS. AND YOU WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LONG COATED AB. IN YOUR TIME WAS CUT OFF BECAUSE I HEARD YOU SAY LONG COVERT IN THE MISS MELINDA'S BECAUSE OF THE TIME CONSTRAINTS THE COMMITTEE CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY. TO SET A CURIOSITY. SURE I'M HAPPY IT. IS ON. YES SIR. I'M I'M HAPPY TO TAKE FURTHER QUESTIONS AS WELL BUT I MEAN I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PARENTS AROUND THIS COUNTRY MAYBE AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE. UNFAIRLY TERRORIZED- BY CERTAIN REPORTS ABOUT WHAT LONG COVE IT IS WHAT IT REPRESENTS. AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE THE VACCINE AND PROTECT THEMSELVES OR LOW RISK OR HAVE PRIOR INFECTION ARE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THIS POSSIBILITY AND I THINK IT'S GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION TO FOCUS ON THE DATA. AND FOCUS ON NOT SCARING PEOPLE THAT REASSURING THEM WITH REASSURING DATA WE HAVE AND- NOW I CAN GO TO THE LIST BUT THERE LARGE DATASETS FROM DENMARK ENGLAND- THE NETHERLANDS FRANCE THAT BASICALLY SHOW FOR THE LARGE PART. DIMS RESOLVE- FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SYMPTOMS THE SYMPTOMS THAT ARE MOST CONSISTENTLY SEEN. THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT TO CONTROL GROUPS AND CONTROL GROUPS THAT NEVER TESTED POSITIVE FOR SARS COMMITTEE MEETING NEVER TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVE IT. IS ANOSMIA MEANING LACK OF SMALL WHICH CAN PERSIST FOR A FEW MONTHS AND WE KNOW THAT'S BECAUSE THE VIRUS TARGETS SOME OF THOSE RECEPTORS. BUT EVEN THAT RESOLVES. AND IT'S VERY REASSURING AND WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT. YOU KNOW SINCE TWENTY TWENTY WE'VE HAD. MENDIS AWARENESS OF VIRAL ILLNESS AS IF IT WASN'T PRESENT. PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY UNIT HAS BEEN AND WE HAVE SOME VERY GOOD DATA FROM- THE OTHER ONES IN PARTICULAR WAVE MIND ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD DATA TO LOOK AT. WHAT IS THE PERSISTENCE OF SYMPTOMS AFTER WALKER IDEA VIRAL ILLNESSES THAT WE FACE ALL THE TIME SUCH AS INFLUENZA. AND IT'S ABOUT THE SAME. AND THEY LOOKED AT OVER EIGHTY MILLION ELECTRONIC RECORDS AND THEY LOOKED AT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND CALL THE PATIENTS IN COMPARISON. AND SENT THANK YOU. I KNOW THERE'S SOME OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I HAD- FOR YOU BUT YOU AS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT ONE FOR ME I KNOW IT WAS THAT CURIOUS ABOUT THE ACTUAL SURVEY. THAT WAS CITED BY DR PANS GROUP. IT WAS ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR COMMENT- THAT YOU MADE THAT YOU HAVE A- NO WHAT WAS THE EXACT WORD YOU USE YOU HAVE- NO COMPELLING. IN THIS YOUR BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN CORRECT REPORTS CERTIFIED EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN I'VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR MORE THAN. TWENTY ONE YEARS NOW OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I DO HAVE I'M JUST A STATEMENT THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THEM THE AUTHOR AND I'M SORRY CENTER YOU WANT ME TO COMMENT ON THE STUDY FOR THE STATUS SERVING- IF YOU HAVE A BRIEF COMMENT ON THE STUDY SURVEY THAT WAS BROUGHT FORTH THEN YES THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I'D LIKE YOU TO DO AS WELL. I DO- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE POINTS I WAS TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE TESTS EVEN MANAGING TEST WHICH HONESTLY GOOD LET HOME ALTERNATIVE RATHER THAN PCR WHICH CAN BE OVERLY SENSITIVE. IS THAT. GIVEN THE PERFORMANCE STATISTICS AND WE CAN GO THROUGH WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW GETTING THE WEEDS. BUT CALIFORNIA HAD BASICALLY SEVEN WEEKS WITHIN THE LAST FIFTY TWO WEEKS WERE FALSE POSITIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN LOWER THAN TRUE POSITIVES MEANING FALSE POSITIVE WOULD BE SITUATIONS WHERE CHILDREN OTHER PEOPLE WOULD BE SENT HOME. UNNECESSARILY EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT TRULY INFECTED. AND THAT PERIOD OF TIME WAS ROUGHLY AROUND DECEMBER TWENTY SECOND I THINK YOU FEBRUARY SEVENTH I HAVE IN MY NOTES. BUT THAT'S THE ONLY PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE TRUE POSITIVES WITH X. WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE INAPPROPRIATE POSITIVE SO TO SPEAK. AND IN THE STUDY CITED- BY- SOME OF THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL. THEY'RE TESTING POSITIVITY RATE WAS ZERO POINT 1% I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD BREAK IT 7% SEVEN AND A HALF ACTUALLY. TO BUY THEIR- OWN SURVEY. A SEVEN HUNDRED AND 50% DIFFERENTIAL OF FALSE POSITIVES TO TRUE POSITIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT BY THEIR OWN DATA NOW THAT'S OFTEN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY THE WAY IT'S NOT EVEN CURRENT WITH OMICRON WHICH IS A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION. AS ABOUT 50% OF CALIFORNIAN HOUSEHOLDS FOUND OUT IN THOSE FOSTER POSITIVES WOULD REQUIRE KIDS TO BE OUT OF SCHOOL FOR IT THAT'S CORRECT HAND YOU KNOW THE I THINK WAS MS VASES DAVE I'M SORRY SHE'S A PHYSICIAN I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TITLE WAS BUT SHE BROUGHT UP. SOMETHING ABOUT THE BERKELEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN RAVENS WHAT I MEAN I PRACTICE IN A HOSPITAL THAT'S RECEIVING FACILITY FOR MANY PATIENTS FROM RAVENS WITH. SO WHATEVER TESTING WAS DONE THERE THAT HELPED THEM GET ACCESS THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT I SAW A LOT OF FAMILIES IN THE BILL A LOT OF IN THE PEDIATRIC ER EXPRESSLY FOR SPECIFICS PRESLEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING TESTS AND- IT DIDN'T MITIGATE THAT. AND I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING TO AND- BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT UP THE BERKELEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ISSUED DAMAGE DONE. IS A FATHER IN THE DISTRICT TO REACHED OUT TO ME. AND HIS SON. HE'S FOURTEEN I WAS PERMISSION TO REVEAL IS BY THE WAY I HAVE AS PERMISSION TO SHARE THIS. IN THE MAIL THIS IS REGARDING THE STUDY THOUGH SIR BECAUSE NO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY IT'S REGARDING HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH HIS PERSONAL RISK HIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TO THE DISTRICT. AND HIS SON IS A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WHO WAS. ACCIDENT AND WAS STRUCK BY AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WHO. WAS STRIKING HIM FOR THE REASON THAT HE WAS ON VACCINATED. YOU KNOW I STRONGLY SUPPORT- VACCINATION I REALLY DO AFFECTED VACCINATIONS. IN THE RIGHT POPULATIONS FOR SURE. BUT- THE OTHER RING AND THE VICTORY ALL FOR NO CLEAR BENEFIT REALLY BOTHERS ME- AS A PHYSICIAN AND THE CITIZENS AN APPARENT. AND IN HIS PUBLIC REQUESTS TO THE BERKELEY SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM JANUARY FOURTH TO JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH FORTY FIVE OF FIFTY SEVEN OF THE STUDENTS THAT TESTED POSITIVE IN THE DISTRICT WERE VACCINATED. THANK YOU SIR I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN I JUST HAVE A STATEMENT- THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE AN AND- I MEAN ALL OF US RATE THAT SERVE THE UNITED STATES MILITARY LIKE I SAID I THINK THERE'S FOUR OF US MAYBE FIVE OF US. ALSO BECAUSE I DON'T REQUIRE I DON'T RECALL BUT TO THERE'S FOUR OF US DEFINITELY- WE TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE TO SWEAR TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION THE UNITED STATES AGAINST ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC. AND WE ALWAYS AS MY COLLEAGUE IN STOCKTON IS WHISPERING IN MY EAR WE ALSO TAKE EVERY VACCINE THAT WAS REQUIRED OF US WHICH WE DID. UNITED STATES MILITARY. I REMEMBER GOING THROUGH THAT LINE I'M SURE JUST LIKE SHE'D. WITH THOSE OF THIS AIR- BUT- ED THE CON. WHICH I'M GOING TO DO GO THROUGH WHICH ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE. LIKE THERE ARE OF US ARE THE DAIS IDEA WE DON'T. BUT THE CONCERT. IS HIGHEST LAW. IN AND HAS SOME. KNOWS A BILL OVER. IN THE OF RIGHTS OR CENTER FOR. RIGHTS DURING. THE FREEDOM RELIGION SPEECH. TO AND OTHER THINGS. BUT THEM. ALL OF OUR CHILDREN ARE PROTECTED. FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION NO MATTER WHAT THEIR RACE ETHNIC BACKGROUND RELIGION SEX. OR WHETHER THEY'RE RICH OR POOR CITIZEN AND NONCITIZEN. AND WHEN YOU GET THE DEFINITION BACKGROUND BASED ON THE CONSTITUTION. IT SAYS ANY BACKGROUND. AND IT'S NOT JUST. IT IN THE BACKGROUND AS AND A DEFINITION THERE. THAT ANY ANY PERSON AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT. OR THE STATE. EXIST AND- TO LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL OR DO ANYTHING UNLESS THEY COMPLY WITH RULES. THAT ARE SET FORTH BY THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. IS A VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION EVERY YEAR THAT WE GET ELECTED WE SWEAR TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION- THE OTHER THING IS THAT. THESE PARENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CO PARENT WITH GOVERNMENT. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO AND COMPLY WITH THIS IF YOU HAVE IF YOU WANT AND YOU'VE DONE THE RESEARCH AND YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO BE FULLY VACCINATED AND BOOSTED. THAT IS YOUR RIGHT AND NO ONE OUT IN THE HALLWAY SHOULD EVER SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT IT. BUT IF YOU WORRY PARENT THAT HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THE VACCINE OR ANY VACCINE OR ANYTHING INJECTED IN YOUR CHILD THEN YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT. TO REPRESENT THE INTEREST OF YOUR CHILD IT'S YOUR CHILD AND SO I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND ANY OTHER LEGISLATION THAT COMES FORWARD. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AUTHOR TO- YOU KNOW ADDRESS OR LISTEN TO THE PARENTS THAT HAVE HUGE CONCERNS AND I THINK HE DOES BUT TO RESPECT. THEIR RIGHTS JUST AS WHEN THEY CAME INTO THIS BUILDING- SOME OF THE THINGS THEY SAY ABOUT YOU WERE ALLOWED THIS. APPETITE AS WELL THEY SHOULD. YOUR OPINION AND YOUR RIGHTS JUST AS MUCH AS- SIX BREAK IT RESPECT THEIR OPINIONS AND THEIR RIGHTS- SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE- SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM BASED HERE I WANT TO THANK THE- CHAIRS- CENTER PAN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- HAPPENED A CO AUTHOR OF THAT I WANT TO THANK CENTER AND FOR BEING AN EXTRAORDINARY LEADER- IN PUBLIC HEALTH- AND KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY HEALTHY- AND SAFE AND HE'S BEEN THE SUBJECT OF. A BRUTAL PERSONAL ATTACKS INCLUDING PHYSICAL ASSAULTS- AND HE KEEPS DOING IT YOU COULD BE DOING A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND KEEPS DOING THIS. FIVE HE CAN ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY ANY TEARS ABOUT THE FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO- CENTER POUND THANK YOU FOR. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP I SUPPORT THIS BILL- AND I WILL SAY I REPRESENT A HUGE NUMBER OF OUR PARENTS. IN MY UNITY WHO. THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO BE SAFE AND HEALTHY AT SCHOOL- AND THEY WANT. TO HAVE AS MUCH CONFIDENCE AS POSSIBLE- BECAUSE THEY WANT THEIR KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL AND I'VE- BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF KEEPING THE SCHOOLS OPEN. ORANGE WANT KIDS PHYSICALLY IN SCHOOL- AND THEY WANT THEM PHYSICALLY AND TO BE SAFE- AND TESTING AS PART OF KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS SAFE- YES KIDS ARE AT LOWER RISK THAN ADULTS WHEN IT COMES TO CURB IT BUT THERE ARE KIDS WHO DO GET VERY SICK AND HE GOT HOSPITALIZED EVEN DIE FROM CODE AND THEY CAN THEN BRING CLOSER TO HOME. TO A PARENT OR GRANDPARENT WHO MAY BE MORE RISK- AND SO TESTING IS A KEY PART OF ANY PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY- YOU KNOW WE ARE IN A BETTER PLACE RIGHT NOW WITH CODE THAT WE WERE A YEAR OR YEAR AND A HALF AGO THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE. BUT WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC AND YOU CAN'T COMPARE- THIS- THIS VIRUS JUST LIKE THE COMMON COLD- THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS- FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE- IN TESTING AS PART OF ANY SMART PUBLIC HEALTH- STRATEGY SO I. WILL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK FROM THE COMMITTEE SENATOR EGGMAN PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A DOCTOR PAN. SO THERE WAS A LOT. LOT OF COMMENTS WILL HURT AND WE'VE BEEN WE'VE- IS NOT THIS OUR FIRST TIME- WITH THIS ISSUE. SO WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THINGS IN. AND I FOR ONE AM NOT A PART OF ANY SECRET SOCIETY NOR NOR AM I FOR DINAMIC TESTING FROM CHINA SO. TO SAY THAT HOWEVER CAN YOU TELL ME JUST ONE MORE TIME BECAUSE I READ THIS BILL AND I LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS. AND IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT'S GOING TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE TESTING THAT PEOPLE ARE USING IS- HIS STUDENTS TO THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE TO DO THE ACTUAL STEP. UP HERE CURING VENDORS OF DOING ALL THAT THEMSELVES THIS IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO STAY OPEN THE TEACHER CHILDREN. BUT I THINK MAYBE MY- COLLEAGUES FROM TO THE CALIFORNIA HAS CHILDREN IN. SCHOOL BUT I EXPECT I AM I AM SOMEONE WHO DIES WHO AS A CHILD STILL IN THE CASE TWELVE. AND HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS- IN THE END I WOULD SAY A LOT OF TIMES IT'S YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD A LOT FOR A LOT FROM PEOPLE TO HELP US ALL LEAVE IT RIGHT THERE. BUT CAN YOU IS IT IS THIS SOME KIND OF. SOMETHING IS GOING TO GO IN. AND BE TESTING CHILDREN EVERY DAY. TAKING THEM OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE IT LOOKS TO ME. LIKE IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PLANS IN PLACE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS CAN STAY OPEN. I CAN USE CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT FOR ME. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN FOR THAT QUESTION REALLY APPRECIATE THAT'S BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT BEING SAID ABOUT THE BILL THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY IN THE BILL. SO WHAT THE BILL CALLS FOR IS THE COST FOR. EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND OTHER ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS OVER TO HAVE A TESTING PLAN AND ACTUALLY- WORK WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH BY THE WAY WILL BE PROVIDING. ADVICE SUPPORT RIGHT HE SAID- WE WANTS- DEFINING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES INCLUDING TAX ASSISTANCE. SUPPORT GUIDANCE MONITORING EVALUATION. XIN SO THE IDEA IS THAT AND ALSO IT'S- DEPENDING ON GOING ON IN THE APARTMENT SO BRING NOW WE'RE LOW BIT A LOT FOR HALF WE DON'T NEED TO TEST THIS MUCH WHEN THE CASE. GO UP. WE NEED TO MORE BECAUSE ULTIMATE WE WANT TO KEEP. KIDS SAFE IN SCHOOL IT ALSO PARENTS WANT TO KNOW. I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT THIS I MEAN I HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL MANY OF YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL- YOU'RE READY GAME THAT NO SAYING SOMEONE IN THIS CLASS HAD HEAD LICE RIGHT- BECAUSE PARENTS WANT TO KNOW NOW HEAD LICE IS A DEADLY DISEASE. BUT YEAH SO WHAT'S AND- IS THAT THERE ARE FAMILIES- THEIR CHILDREN IN SCHOOL WHO ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO THE DISEASE. MAY HAVE DIABETES ASTHMA OTHER CONDITIONS. THEY MAY HAVE THEY THEY MAY BE GOING HOME TO A HOUSEHOLD. AND SO WHERE SOMEONE MAY BE AT HIGH RISK OF COVERAGE. SO AGAIN. THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY FOR PARENTS THOSE TWO BECAUSE PARENTS DON'T WANT THEIR POWER IN FACT. AND KNOW ABOUT IT. HOME AND THE POTENTIALLY PUT SOMEONE ELSE IN DANGER SO. HELPS ENSURE THAT. APPLICANTS CAN FORM. CASE THEIR CHOPS SPOKE. TESTING ALLOWS US TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. AND IN TERMS OF THE DISEASE OUTBREAKS SCHOOL BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS. WITHOUT TESTING IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU DON'T. GOING TO GET THIS TEST IS ON AND ALSO TO BE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT DOING EXCEPT. HE HAD. LEVEL THAT'S WHAT. WHY PROVIDE A GUIDANCE BUT ALSO OTHER PART OF IT IS SOME SAID WELL THIS IS ONLY. WELL ACTUALLY PART OF THE IS ABOUT FUNDING APPROPRIATELY OF TESTS AT SCHOOL SO. YOU KNOW THERE IS A BUT WE WON'T BE SCHOOL ARE ABLE DO THE- IS WELL AS WELL. AS AND- IN SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT ABOUT SUPPORTING OUR SCHOOLS. TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN KEEP THEIR CHILDREN AT SCHOOL SAFE. TO KEEP SCHOOLS OPEN WE WANT SCHOOLS CLOSING WOULD LIKE IN PERSON LEARNING AND ALSO- WE ARE BE SURE FORTY PARENTS WHO ARE PAYING IT'S A SCHOOL THE- KNOW. THAT THE OF. YOU NEED. DON'T HELP BOOKS. THEIR TRUCK AS WELL TO SAY EVERY CHILD IS TO GET TO IS GONNA SAY IF SOMETHING AT THIS THE APPROPRIATE P. WILL BE A PROTOCOL ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND HELP PARENTS WILL BE NOTIFIED SO YOU SEE COOL THIS IT CALLED AND BEND IT WILL. AND IT WILL HAVE TESTING PLANNED- REQUIRING TO HAVE A TESTING PLAY AND ALL GET ASSISTANCE THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH- AND THIS TESTING PLAN SUCH BE- CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES. CORRECT. SENATOR LEYVA GO HEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I HEARD ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES TALKING ABOUT VACCINES AND BEING REQUIRED TO GET VACCINATED. THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH GETTING VACCINATED CORRECT NO THIS HAS TO DO WITH HAVING. AT YOUR MEN THAT. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DEVELOP AND SELLS THIS IS ACTUALLY. SILENT ON ANY REQUIREMENTS FOR VACCINATION- FOR KOBE IN SCHOOLS THANK YOU AND THEN I WAS READING THE SUMMARY HERE AND IT SAYS REQUIRES A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC. CDPH TO CONTINUE. ADMINISTERING SO THIS IS NOT EVEN A NEW PROGRAM THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN HAPPENING AT OUR SCHOOLS. OKAY JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR THAT. THEY'RE NOT JUST ON I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION TO BEING TESTED I MEAN WE'VE BEEN TESTING TWICE A WEEK HERE IN THE SENATE FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY ONE WHO HAS HAD A FALSE POSITIVE. AND IT JUST HELPS US KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN- SOMEONE OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S PRESCHOOL TESTED POSITIVE. THEY CALLED ALL THE PARENTS TO LET THEM KNOW. PEOPLE JUST WANT TO KNOW I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH PEOPLE BEING TESTED AND PEOPLE HAVING KNOWLEDGE. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING ON THE BILL. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH GO AHEAD PLEASE IS THE QUICKER QUESTION I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR. SO ARE WE SETTING THE RULES SOMEBODY USE THE TERM THE PHRASE RULES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR WE SETTING THE RULES FOR WHEN TESTING OCCURS OR IF TESTING OCCURS OR IS SOME OTHER ENTITIES SUCH AS THE CDC OR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF. PUBLIC HEALTH EXPAND SO WE ARE ASKING THAT EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE OTHER ENTITIES SO THERE'S IT'S LIKE THEY HAVE TO GO FOR ITS ADDRESS- ACTUALLY DEVELOPED A TEST YOU KNOW HAVE A TESTING PLANNED SO THEY NEED TO HAVE ONE THEY CAN'T JUST NOT HAVE A PLAN AT ALL IN THAT PLAN. TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF THE HEALTH GUIDELINES AND OF COURSE WON THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE OTHER ENTITIES LAW SCHOOL OF SITUATIONS ETCETERA TO SEE SEVEN IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THAT PLAN SO IF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CAN ANALYZING RECESSING THE CURRENT IN THIS CASE COVERT. NINETEEN RATE LEVEL WHATEVER THAT. HEALTH RELATED TO IS. DETERMINES THAT NO TESTING. IS REQUIRED IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE OPERATION IN CALIFORNIA. DOES THAT MEAN A LOT OF- LOCAL EDUCATIONAL THIRTY A SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD NOT HAVE TO- MINUTES TESTING PLAN. YES IF WE IF THAT TURNS OUT WE ARE ABLE TO GET THE CASE RATE OF COATED LOW ENOUGH- THEN- TESTING MAY BE UNNECESSARY AND- THAT'S- AND THAT MAY BE THE RECOMMENDATION CORRECT AND THAT'S WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. NOT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT'S CORRECT YES THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK THAT'S EVERYONE NOW SO IT IS MY TURN- SO IT LOOKS TO ME AS THOUGH IT DOES. THE BILL DOES REQUIRE THAT A PLAN IS IN PLACE AND THAT TESTING- TAKE PLACE SO. OKAY CALIFORNIA NATIONWIDE. AND I THINK WE HAVE 12% OF THE STUDENTS IN THE COUNTRY AND WE ONLY HAD 1% OF A SCHOOL CLOSURES BECAUSE OF COPING. SO THAT SEEMS A BIT DISPROPORTIONATE AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE DATA HAS SHOWN THAT- THESE HOME TESTS. AREN'T ALWAYS- AS EFFECTIVE AS WE WOULD LIKE AND I HAVE A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THAT AS DO OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY- THE HOME TESTS JUST. THEY'RE JUST NOT AS EFFECTIVE YOU CAN HAVE CODED AND THEN YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T SHOW POSITIVE FOR FIVE DAYS SO. REALLY WHAT ARE WE MITIGATING IF A STUDENT STATE TEST NEGATIVE- BUT ACTUALLY HAS COVE AND INCOMES TO SCHOOL ANYWAY- NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT. THE FOCUS IS ON ON KIDS FOR TESTING THEM BUT WHAT WE'RE NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HIS. THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY THEIR PARENTS ARE PERHAPS THEIR OLDER SIBLINGS OR GRANDPARENTS TO LIVE WITH THEM WHO ARE GOING OUT IN IN BEING IN A PUBLIC SETTING AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW THEY'RE BRINGING AND HOW WE'D I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN PINPOINT- THAT THAT. INFECTION NECESSARILY TOOK PLACE AT THE SCHOOL NOT TO MENTION. AS SYMPTOMATIC TESTING OF STUDENTS. WE HAVE SEEN JUST. REALLY DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY MITIGATING EFFECT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S DATA WE HAVE. THE- ON HERE. OKAY SO THE- THERE IS A COMPANY THE COLOR COMPANY I THINK IT'S CALLED THEY DID A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND RAPID TEST MUCH LIKE THE ONES THAT WE TAKE LEGISLATORS EVERY SUNDAY BEFORE WE COME UP HERE TO SACRAMENTO AND THEN WE TAKE ANOTHER ONE- ON WEDNESDAYS THEY DID HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THESE RAPID TESTS- ONLY SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TEST- SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE OF THEM SHOWED POSITIVE. OF THE 600-233-0080 FIVE OF THEM ONE SEEDED A FURTHER PCR TEST WHICH IS THE GOLD STANDARD ONLY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE OF THEM- I'M SORRY EXCUSE ME THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE OF THEM TURNED OUT TO BE NEGATIVE THEY DIDN'T HAVE COVERAGE. SO I MEAN THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE THAT'S JUST THE FACT THAT THESE TESTS ARE JUST NOT ANALYSIS THAT'S OUT THERE SUGGEST THAT THESE TESTS ARE MISSING ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE WHO ARE INFECTED WITH THIS VIRUS IN KIDS AT THIRD SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS AND I'VE SEEN IN MY OWN KIDS- SCHOOLS BECAUSE I DO STILL HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL MYSELF. OR MY OWN CHILD GOT SENT HOME BECAUSE HE COST IT'S COOL. LEADING TO A TEST AND SO HE HAD A QUARANTINE AND THEN THERE WERE SOMEONE ELSE AT SCHOOL HAD QUARANTINE. BECAUSE THERE IS A POSITIVE TEST IN TURNS OUT THAT STUDENT DID NOT HAVE CODED SO NOW THEY'VE MISSED EVEN MORE INSTRUCTION AND TO ME IT'S- TO THE POINT F ABSURDITY NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS TO THESE KIDS YOU CANNOT KEEP REMOVING THEM FROM THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT AFTER WHERE HE DID THAT TO THEM FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND EXPECT THEM TO BE LEARNING IN A WAY THAT'S GOING TO HELP THEM SUCCEED AND THRIVE AND BE ABLE TO PASS THE TESTING GOING TO WHATEVER IT IS THEY GOING TO AFTER HIGH SCHOOL- IT. YOU KNOW I GET IT WE ALL WANT TO BE SAFE FROM CALVIN WE DO BUT IT'S THIS OBSESSION WITH FOCUSING ON KIDS I JUST THINK NEEDS TO STOP- NOT TO MENTION. I GUESS THE ONE THING WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WAS. YOU KNOW WHEN THESE KIDS ARE REMOVED FROM THE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TESTED POSITIVE IN MAYBE IT'S A FALSE POSITIVE MAYBE IT'S AN ACTUAL POSITIVE OR THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOMEBODY IN THE CLASSROOM AND SO THEY DECIDE THIS. JOHN HAS TO QUARANTINE. WHY IS THERE NO FOCUSED ON WHAT THAT CHILD IS DOING WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE CLASSROOM. BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE PROBABLY HOPEFULLY WORKING- WHY NO FOCUS ON THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT CHILD BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE PSYCHOLOGICALLY TO THESE KIDS FROM BEING PULLED OUT OF THEIR CLASSROOMS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR COMPUTER. THE DAMAGES THAT WE JUST HAD A BILL TALKING ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE AND WANTING TO HAVE MORE FUNDING FOR WE CANNOT IGNORE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE KEEP THIS SYSTEM IN PLACE. OF BEING ABLE TO REMOVE KIDS FROM THE CLASSROOM. WITH KEVIN TESTING AND NOT TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO THAT- I. I'M SORRY I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND I DEEPLY RESPECT- THE INTENT. BEHIND TRYING TO KEEP EVERYBODY SAFE BUT THIS BILL JUST IT DOESN'T DO THAT AND I WISH THAT WE COULD STOP WITH THIS OBSESSION OF GOING AFTER KIDS WHO CAN'T STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEIR KIDS WELL THAT'S WHAT I WAS PERRANCE HERS. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO SO RESPECTFULLY- I CANNOT VOTE FOR THIS BILL SO WITH THAT MISTER OR DOCTOR PAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE HER BIG WIN COME. OF COURSE SENATOR ROUGHLY ZERO I'VE HEARD THE STATEMENT THAT THE BILL REQUIRES TESTING AND- YOU KNOW MAYBE. MAYBE THAT'S ONE INTERPRETATION OF ITBUT YOU KNOW BEING. THE FORMER LAWYER THAT I AM I HAVE TO READ. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SHALL CONTINUE ADMINISTERING THOSE COVERT TESTING PROGRAMS IN LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. SHALL ADMINISTER A TESTING PROGRAM SO THAT MAY REQUIRE. SOME LEVEL OF TESTING WE CLEAR OTHERWISE OR MAY NOT DEPENDING ON THE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH I JUST THINK WE OUGHTA WELL MAKE THAT. CLARIFICATION AND THEN THE NEXT. WIND DOWN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SHALL ADMINISTER TESTING PROGRAMS WELL IT DOESN'T SAY TEST MINISTRY TESTING PROGRAM. SO TO BE CLEAR. ADMINISTERING A TESTING PROGRAM PURSUANT TO A PLAN. MAY REQUIRE TESTING TO DEPENDING ON WHAT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH SAYS FOR THE CDC OR IT MAY NOT SO I THINK WE OUGHT TO. JUST MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH AND JUST I MEAN I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM BUT IN MY INTERPRETATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL IT GIVES ITS STATUTORY PERMANENCE SO THAT MEANS THEN THAT IT'S A VERY ACROSS THE STATE THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY AND THAT'S FRANKLY THE LAST THING- THAT WE WANT TO DO BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS DR PAN DID YOU WANT TO CLOSE. I'M SORRY DID YOU HAVE COMMENTS. GLIMCHER HELLO YES GO AHEAD I APOLOGIZE I FORGET HOW THAT'S OKAY WE HAVE CENTER GONZALEZ PLEASE GETTING VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANNA- TO REITERATE MY THANKS TO A DOCTOR PAN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I MYSELF HAVE A YOUNG ONE IN K. THROUGH TWELVE- HE HAD BEEN TESTING SINCE FOR THE LAST YEAR HE DID RANDOM TESTS HE DID TEST WEEKLY WE HAVE A AT HOME TEST IT'S A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT THAT- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT MY SON GOES TO HAD HAS DONE. ALL TO KEEP OTHER STUDENTS AND PARENTS SAFE MY FATHER TAKES CARE OF MY SON AFTER WORK BECAUSE CLEARLY I'M HERE IN SACRAMENTO I WANT TO KEEP HIM SAFE AS WELL WE NEED TO KNOW SO FOR ME- THE TESTING MY SIX YEAR OLD HASN'T EVEN COMPLAINED ONCE IT'S FORTUNATE THAT WERE IN THIS TIME WE'RE WE'RE CHILDREN ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THIS TYPE OF RIGOROUS TESTING- VACCINES IN HEARING ABOUT DEATH AND IT'S TOUGH AND I KNOW THAT AS A PARENT MYSELF. BUT FOR ME- I KNOW THAT IT'S KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY- AGAIN TO REITERATE SENATOR POINT MODERATE. NOT EVERY A HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE TESTED DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE EVERY SINGLE DAY CAN BE WERE A VARIETY OF THINGS CUSTOMIZED FOR THAT REGION AGAIN WITH THE GOAL OF KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE SO THAT AS SUPPORT THANK. THANK DR PAN. THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THAT'S AND FROM ALL OF YOU ON THE COMMITTEE- BUT IT'S MAKING A FIFTY THREE POINTS- SELF FIRST OF ALL- TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS DEPENDS ON LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES SO THERE'S A KIND OF A CONSISTENCY WELL BECAUSE OF CFC BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT SO IF WE HAVE A HIGHER CASE OF KOBE. AND I DO I REITERATE IT IS A SERIOUS DISEASE ALL RIGHT THIS IS NOT A DISEASE BE TAKEN LIGHTLY- YEAH WE HAD A WHOLE HEARING ON LONG COVE IT AND I APPRECIATE THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WERE PRESENT THERE AND SAID YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WHO TELL. TELL TOLD US THAT FONG COVERED SERIOUS RIGHT THAT THAT THE ONE TO ADDICTS YOU EXPERIENCED. SUGAR STORIES WITH US. THAT YOU WE JUST A TESTING. BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT SO IF THERE'S A LOT OF. COOLEY GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY- AND YOUR INCREASE IN SCHOOL THEN YOU'RE PREGNANT TEST MORE FREQUENTLY IN THE MORE CERVANTES THINK IF THAT GOES DOWN. SO AND PERHAPS EVEN NOT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE CASE THREE THREE THREE LOW AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY- WE WANT TO ACTUALLY WE LET EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT. SIMILAR TESTING PLAN WE DIDN'T DICTATE TO THEM EXACTLY WHAT IT IS I DIDN'T I'M NOT TRYING TO. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LEGISLATION SO THAT LEGISLATORS IS VERY SPECIFIC REGIMENTED BY LAW IN THE CODE TESTING PLANS AND SAID WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE FARM PUBLIC HEALTH ON THAT- I. ALSO WANT NOTE- THE TERM OF THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO SPEAK. FROM SCHOOLS. RIGHT AND I DON'T KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE CURRENTLY NOT ATTENDING SCHOOL BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE WORRIED THAT THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES AND NOT SAFE ENOUGH FOR THEIR CHILD. THEY'RE WORRIED THEIR CHILD'S GOING TO GET SICK OR THEIR CHILD'S GONNA BRING IT HOME TO SOMEONE THEIR HOUSEHOLD. HE'S GONNA GET REALLY SEPARATE SOMEONE WITH DIABETES SO IT HAS OF SOMEONE WHO'S STRIPPING FREE OR CANCER- SOMEONE. WITH A CHRONIC CONDITION. AND I THINK WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THOSE PARENTS. AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL AND WE WANT TO BE SURE SCHOOLS ARE. OPEN AND SAFE FOR THEM AS WELL. AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- I WOULD ALSO JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT AND AGAIN I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT AND GRATITUDE TO ALL OF YOU HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY- I WAS ON THE MILITARY BUT ACTUALLY DOES WANT TO OTHER- COMMISSION COURTS THAT NON MILITARY IT WAS. ACTUALLY AN OFFICER IN THE US PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE COMMISSIONED CORPS. AND I TOOK THE OATH THE SAME BOTH. JUST MY COUNTRY AS WELL TO BECOME THE COMMISSION OFFICER IN THE US PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE COMMISSIONED CORPS AND WE ALSO BY THE WAY TOOK A SIMILAR OF WHEN WE'RE SWORN INTO OFFICE. SO I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- YOU KNOW THIS. THAT IF THERE'S A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES- WASN'T RAISED BY LET'S COUNCIL THE SUPREME COURT HAS RULED VERY CLEARLY THAT- THAT- WITH THAT WE CAN PUT IN RULES TO KEEP SCHOOLS SAFE BY THE WAY SCHOOLS ARE PLENTY OF ROLES- TRAIT. SEND YOUR KID TO THIS TO YOUR SCHOOL SOMETIMES WITH VIOLATING YEAH YOU KNOW THEY HAVE CLOTHING STANDARDS. OF OTHER TYPES OF STANDARDS AS WELL AND- WE DON'T- DON'T CLAIM THAT THEIR TYRANTS SOMETIMES WE- OBJECT TO THEM THAT'S FINE THAT'S THAT'S PART OF DEMOCRACY. BUT BUT I THINK MOST OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES THAT SCHOOL STUDENTS PLACE TO AND FROM SCHOOL STAY SAFE AND- MOST OF US CAN UNDERSTAND THAT- BUT- AGAIN WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT. OUR CHILDREN. I THAT. WE KNOW WHAT'S ON IN OUR SCHOOL. PARENTS WANT TO KNOW IN ORDER KEEP THEM THEIR CHILDREN'S. THEIR HOUSEHOLD SAFE. SCHOOLS WANT TO BE SURE THEY CAN STAY OPEN THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT WE'RE DOING TESTING SO WE CAN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SCHOOLS WHEN IT COMES TO COBIT. AND HELP WITH WE CAN KEEP COVERED REALLY LOW CASES THEN MAYBE WE DON'T NEED TO DO MUCH TESTING AT ALL ON THIS THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THAT AS WELL. WITH THAT. ESPECIALLY AFTER I VOTE AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR- YOUR YOUR- YOUR- COMMENTS THANK YOU. OUR IS THERE A MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION MADAM SECRETARY WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL PAN HI CAN I AM MELINDA'S NO WINDOWS NO EGGMAN EGGMAN AYE GONZALEZ AND SALAS I GREW NO PROOF NO FURTADO LEYVA. LEYVA AYE LEE MON LIMÓN AYE ROTH ROTH I'VE RUBIO. WIENER WIENER HI. OKAY THANK THE LOCAL AREA THAT BILL- SEVEN TWO AND IT'S ON CALL TILL WE WILL MOVE ON AND MOVE BACK TO. DR PANAS THE CHAIR RIGHT THANK YOU VICE TERM LENDERS FOR CARING RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO NOW GO BACK TO. OUR FILE ORDER SO I THINK CENTER EGGMAN. PLEASE YOUR BILL IS THE NEXT UNDER YOUR RATES ARE SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER ITEM NUMBER SIX SB. TEN OH THREE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE SECURE AND MEMBERS I AM HERE TO PRESENT S. B. TEN OH THREE. AND THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A VOLUNTARY FORTY HOUR TRAUMA INFORMED CARE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR VICTIMS ADVOCATES TO BETTER ASSIST SURVIVORS. IN HEALING AND RECOVERY. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD BE DESIGNATED TO CERTIFY THIS TRAINING THIS TRAINING THAT IS CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW PEOPLE IF THEY WANT TO SERVE AS AN ADDICT ADVOCATE- THERE'S A- THIRTY MINUTE TRAINING THEY CAN TAKE ON TRAUMA. HERE WHICH IS A FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS ADVOCATES RECOGNIZE. RESPOND TO SIGNS SYMPTOMS AND RISK OF TRAUMA. AS IT RELATES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE AND CRIME. THIS EXISTING TRAINING FOCUSES ON HOW THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS VICTIMS RIGHTS VICTIMS RESTITUTION. AND OTHER CRITICAL ASPECTS HOWEVER THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES OF TRAINING IN TRAUMA INFORMED KERR ALONG WITH HIS EXISTING CURRICULUM. I BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING TRAUMA INFORMED CARE IS ESSENTIAL TO AVOID RE TRAUMATIZING. AND HELP OUR SURVIVORS HEAL AND RECOVER SOMETIMES VOLUNTEERS WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS CAN CAN BE A PART OF RE VICTIMIZING SOMEBODY IF THEY ARE INTRODUCED TO A DRAMATIC SITUATION OR IN A SETTING. I REMEMBER WHEN SITTING IN A- COUNCIL MEETING AND SOMEONE COMING AND TESTIFYING ABOUT THEIR ABUSE- CAN I BUY I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A SAFE PLACE FOR THAT PERSON TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT. AND I AND I RESTART AFTERWARDS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING THAT SUPPORT. KIND OF QUESTION THEIR TRAINING AND INVOLVEMENT BEFORE THAT. AND WAS- SURPRISED AT THE LACK OF IT- SO AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE AND WE WANT TO UTILIZE VOLUNTEERS FOR THOSE WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. PEOPLE SHOULD BE WELL INFORMED AND TRAINED IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS AND TO BE ABLE TO MINIMIZE- THINGS THAT COULD COME UP FOR PEOPLE. WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED AND VIOLATED SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE ESTABLISHING PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL SAFETY FOR THEM. BUILDING TRUST PROVIDING SURVIVOR CENTERED EVIDENCE BASED CARE ALLOWING FOR A TANAMI AND SURVIVORS TRIED TO FIGHT THEIR OWN NEEDS FOR HEALING. AND PROVIDING SERVICES GROUNDED IN THAT INTERSECTION ALITY UNDERSTANDING THAT ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL. AND DEPENDING ON WHO'S WHO SOMEONE IS AND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE IN PLACE IN LIFE THAT CAN LEAD TO- TO THEM BEING TRIGGERED IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF WAYS- SO MANY TIMES. THE LEVEL OF THE TRUMP EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO WORKING WITH VICTIMS ADVOCATES CAN BE EXTREME. AGAIN INCLUDING RAPE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EVEN THE MURDER. OF A LOVED ONE. SB TEN OH THREE WILL ALLOW FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SYSTEM OR OF TRUSTED TRAINING THAT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED BY THE STATE TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE BUT IT MAY BE REQUIRED BY DA'S OFFICES OR OTHER EMPLOYERS. TO WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE THIS- BUT IF THERE IS A DEPARTMENT A DA THE BILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A TRAINING TO PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE. OF THAT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH HAS APPROVED. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE STILL HERE THEY MAY HAVE HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF THE- THE LINKS OF THE WEIGHT BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY BE AVAILABLE THEM BY PHONE.

WITH ADVOCATES ENGAGE WITH CRIME SURVIVORS HAVE EXPERIENCED VIOLENCE RADICAL THAT. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT TRAINING PROGRAM FOR THE VICTIM ADVOCATES DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TRAINING IN TRAUMA INFORMED KERR. TRAUMA INFORMED KERR IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE RANGE OF SYMPTOMS AND REACTIONS FROM OUT TO TRAUMA THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE. IN WHEN THEY EXPERIENCED VIOLENCE AND HARM AND USING THAT KNOWLEDGE TO FRAME THE WAY WE RESPOND IN IRAQ AND INCREASE ENGAGEMENT TREAT PEOPLE WITH TRAUMA. WITHOUT ADEQUATE TRAINING IN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE PROVIDERS CAN BE FURTHER HARMS IN MY RECENT RESEARCH STUDY SURVIVORS VOICES WHICH- HAD BEEN GOING TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND ELEVEN SURVIVORS.

BEING A PROSECUTOR IS A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT HEALING THE COMMUNITIES WHEN. DRESSING TRAUMA AND ALTERNATELY PREVENTING YOU FROM US IN THE COMMEMORATION FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. OUR VICTIM ADVOCATES ARE CRITICAL TO THE PRODUCT THAT. THEY HELP MAKE VICTIMS EXPERIENCES WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM MUST DRAMATIC IN EASIER TO UNDERSTAND INCLUDING ASSISTING THEM DURING INVESTIGATIONS AND COURT PROCEEDINGS. AND HELPING THEM FILE CREATED FOR VICTIM COMPENSATION. BUT PARTLY THEY PROVIDE HOPE IN HEALING DAN HOW'RE VICTIMS IN THE RECOVERY FROM CRISIS TO CRISIS INTERVENTION IN OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES. HOWEVER WHAT WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE VICTIMS AND WITH ADVOCATES THEMSELVES. IS THAT THE CURRENT TRAINING FOR IT LACKS. OKAY I TRUMP FORM. H.

HI I'M I'M CAME HOME BACK FROM A FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR WORKING FOR SAN MATTEO COUNTY HEALTH. MY COLLEAGUES MY WORKING IN OUR PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM SIX THIS DATABASE IS A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. MOST NOVEL ELEMENT IS THAT IT WILL BE UPDATED IN REAL TIME TO REFLECT BETTER AVAILABILITY. CURRENTLY PARTICIPATION PSYCHIATRIC UNIT IS FULL IN APPRECIATION TO BE SENT TO AN OUTSIDE HOSPITAL. A NURSE WORKS WITH A LIST OF HOSPITALS IN CONTACT NUMBERS AND SPENDS THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS MAKING PHONE CALLS. SPEAKING MESSAGES AND FAX RECORDS HOPING TO LOCATE A BAD. OFTEN THE CONTRACT INFORMATION IS INACCURATE IN THE STRUGGLE TO REACH THE CORRECT PERSON A POTENTIAL RECEIVING HOSPITAL. CUMBERSOME INEFFICIENT PROCESS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO STAFF BURNOUT THIS DATABASE WILL HELP GUARDIAN'S OFFICE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FINDING LONG TERM PLACEMENTS FOR PEOPLE ON MENTAL HEALTH CONSERVATORSHIP. WE'D FIFTY BED DATABASE WILL BE VERY HELPFUL IN THEIR WORK AS WELL. MANY OF THE CLIENTS HAVE COMPLEX MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH NEEDS SUCH AS MOBILITY IMPAIRMENT IN FLINT REQUIREMENTS IN OTHER HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT COME DIFFICULT TO PLACE SOME SPEND MONTHS AND MONTHS IN THE HOSPITAL WAITING FOR A BED AT A LOWER LEVEL OF CARE. BUT STATE OFFICIALS WOULD GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT LARGE SCALE SEARCHES OF MANY FACILITIES ACROSS A LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND MORE QUICKLY IDENTIFY PLACEMENTS TABLE TO ACCOMMODATE. THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THEIR CLIENTS. ACCORDING TO THIS PROPOSAL BAD DATABASE WILL IMPROVE THE CARE IN MY COUNTY AND WILL BENEFIT SMALLER HOSPITALS AND UNDERSERVED COUNTIES EVEN MORE. THE SUMMER OF UBER OR LIFT RIDE WITHIN MINUTES WHY CAN'T WE USE INTERNET BASED TECHNOLOGY TO FIND TO FIND A METHOD MENTAL HEALTH THAT. THE FACT WILL BE THE ABILITY TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT INTENSITY AT THE RIGHT TIME. IN ADDITION LIKE THIS IS LONG OVERDUE IN CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM BUT SHORTEN THE WAY. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- RIGHT NOW- MODERATOR DEFERRED PLEASE OPEN THE LINES ANY WITNESSES WHO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR. THANK YOU WHICH SPEAK NOT POSITION OF AT ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR THE FIRST ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. SMALL WE HAVE SOMEBODY JUNIOR. OKAY AND. ONE THREE BEFORE PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES HI I WOULD HAVE IT ON MUTE SO I COULDN'T SPEAK SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY I AM FOR THIS. PLEASE ENTER YOUR NAME PLEASE SIGN HAVE. OH SORRY MY NAME IS- BENDABLE PARENTS FROM SAN MATTEO. AND YOUR AND LET BRANDIS. OKAY AT SEND THAT CENTER PROPRIOCEPTIVE CASELLA LAZIM DID YOU SAID YOU WERE IN SUPPORT OF ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR ALL RIGHT OKAY NEXT WITNESS WE'RE TAKING WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR. IN THIS YEAR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'VE ACTIVE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER ROUGH. ASSEMBLY LONDIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH I JUST- I. FULLY SUPPORT YOUR BILL BUT I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT- I KNOW EVEN MORE THAN THIS ONE BUT THE COSTS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING A SYSTEM LIKE THIS WHICH WOULD BE VAST IMMUNITY YOU KNOW STATE OF FORTY MILLION. AND THEN THE ANALYSES ARE YOU KNOW KIND OF HOW WE'VE LOOKED AT OTHER STATES HAVE TRIED TO DO THIS AND THE INABILITY TO REALLY KEEP IT YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR SEVEN UP TODAY IT'S NO SMALL TASK AND I JUST WONDER. IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT I DO I DO WE ARE CURRENTLY AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE SENDING DOWN TO STREAMLINE OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM- TWENTY THREE STATES ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON ASSEMBLY NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE FULLY SUCCESSFUL AT THIS. BUT WE BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN ENOUGH STARTS AND STOPS THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO IT DONE TO GET IT DONE AND WE ARE ALSO WORKING- IN. WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO BE ABLE TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION BECAUSE OF COURSE SOME HAVE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES WITH THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD NO OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING. VERY IN A VERY INTEGRATIVE COLLABORATIVE WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS DONE- AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR OF OUR SYSTEM- WHICH I JUST. THIS UNDERSTOOD THE IDEA THAT WE NEED THIS EVEN MORE BECAUSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT LOOKING AT LIKE TIME FOR ALL THE PLACEMENT HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE HOW LONG SOMEBODY WAITING IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM AND THEN WHAT PART OF THE STATE IS THAT HAPPENING AND WHERE IT'S NOT BECAUSE THAT WILL TELL US ABOUT RESOURCES. SINCE THE PLACEMENT BUT WE'VE HURDLE BUT THIS ME ME BREAD FOR NATALIE. PER SO THEY HAVE TO GET THREE SPENT THREE OR FOUR COUNTIES OVER. HUGE PROBLEMS RIGHT AND THEN WE CAN BETTER DIRECT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS. THAT WE'RE ALSO CURRENTLY HAVING BILLIONS GO DOWN FOR TO BE ABLE TO FIND- DIVERSION FROM INPATIENT SETTINGS TO CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS RIGHT. HOW ARE THOSE THINGS GOING ON BECAUSE WE KNOW WE- THERE'S- ALL THESE DIFFERENT LEVELS. SO IS A COMPLEX YES OF COURSE IT IS. IS IT NECESSARY AND WILL STREAMLINE OUR SYSTEM. I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM THE EXPERTS THAT THEY THINK IT IS- WE AGAIN. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR A LONG TIME. IT IS IT IN MY MIND- OUTRAGEOUS THAT WE'RE STILL USING THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE THE SAME PEOPLE WITH. LICENSE MAKING CALLS. ON THE TELEPHONE FROM A NOTEBOOK- TO TRY TO FIND A BED FOR SOMEBODY. WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. IS SITTING WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS. A MEDICATED AND UNTREATED AS THEY CONTINUE. TO EXAGGERATE. SO IS IT COMPLEX YES IT IS. SO- THE AND THE PERSONAL SERVICE THAT WE'VE BECAUSE WE'VE DOES NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT HAS ONLY BEEN IN THE MILLIONS NOT BILLIONS OKAY SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF SINCE OTHER STATES HAVE TRIED THIS- THE SOFTWARE EXIST THOUGH IT COULD BE IMPROVED IS THAT A CONSIDERATION THAT YOU WOULD DE YOU KNOW SORT OF BORROW THAT OR IT IS THERE. I DON'T KNOW THE NOTION THAT SILICON VALLEY COULD ACTUALLY YOU KNOW HELP WITH THIS AND DEVELOP SOMETHING BECAUSE I JUST THINK IF THE DM B. IF YOU CAN ON THE DMV'S WEBSITE AND SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT ANYWHERE IN THE STATE ANY DMB FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE TEST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SURELY THERE IS THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW. RIGHT OKAY WELL. POSTMASTER THE OBVIOUS HERE THANK YOU. WITH ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN JUST TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT IS BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH COULD BE STATE AGENCIES COULD BE COUNTY AGENCIES COULD BE NONPROFITS SOME OF THE STEP DOWN UNITS SO IT'S NOT JUST DIEM VS JUST ALL. IN A STATE DATABASE SO THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO NEED TO MERGE DIFFERENT DATABASES THANK YOU. I FEDERAL. THANK YOU I HAVE I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO THINK ABOUT THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH IT PROJECTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE CERTAINLY DEMONSTRATED THAT OVER THE LAST TEN TO TWELVE YEARS BUT- HAVING- BEEN A MEMBER OF VARIOUS HOSPITAL BOARDS- DURING MY TIME. ON THIS EARTH PRIOR TO COMING UP HERE TO SACRAMENTO AND- EXPERIENCING THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES. OF FRANKLY FLOODING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS- OF STANDING IN CORNERS HAVING TO BE MONITORED. FOR THE OF SEVENTY TWO HOURS THAT- FOR THE COULD BE HELD IN THOSE DEPARTMENTS I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO WEIGH THE COST. OVERALL CUSTOMER HEALTH SYSTEM OF HAVING TO IN ESSENCE WERE HOUSE. THOSE WHO REALLY DESERVE TO BE IN LICENSED PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT FACILITIES WEIGH THE COST OF THAT TO OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN EVALUATING THE VALUE. THE VALUE- ELEMENTS HERE TO THIS TO THIS PROPOSAL SO I FULLY FULLY SUPPORT IT. OKAY THANK YOU FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SIR EDMUND- I PREFER YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD I THINK- SOME CHANNELS EIGHT AND- CENTERED MELINDA'S BROUGHT UP NOT THE IN TERMS OF- YEAH OTHER STATES HAVE TRIED TO SEND WORKS SO WELL TO ME SOME OF IT IS SAYING TO PROVIDE EXPECTATIONS SO I HAVE TO MAY I GET A LITTLE NERVOUS AND I SAID WELL WE HAVE UBER AND LIFT AND SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE. WE NOW HAVE A DATABASE FOR SOMEONE SO ON THINGS THAT YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT. PERHAPS JUST HAVING ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT KIND OF BEDS THEY HAVE. WHO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FACTORED WAY TO CONTACT HIS THE POINT PERSON FOR A PERSON EVEN THAT ALONE IN A DATABASE THAT'S GOOD THAT'S MAINTAIN WOULD BE HIS READING CORRECT RIGHT SO I DO WANT TO SERVE. THREE YEAR OF THE EXPECTATIONS IN TERMS OF LIKE- WE HAVE A DATABASE SO I KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY EMPTY BEDS ARE RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S COULD BE TOTALLY ACCURATE BUT STILL. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ALL THE TIME. BECAUSE I THINK WE MAY. WE BE ON THE TAX. RIGHT BUT I JUST WANT TO. CONTINUE TO. ON MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK THIS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING PROPOSES. IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA I HOPE I DO HOPE THAT. IN THE CONVERSATION THAT WE SCALE BACK EXPECTATIONS MAYBE WE CAN MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS GREAT BUT- DON'T BE LOW CLASSES ABOUT THAT THE WITH THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE SHOULD SET HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR OURSELVES. AND I WILL SAY. HISTORICALLY THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN OPPOSED TO THIS. NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE JUST BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON ON THEM. HAS COME TO THE POINT WHERE. EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES. THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT WORKING AND WE NEED TO DO IT. BETTER FOR ALL OF US. I'M PEOPLE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT. THAT MY A BILL PACKAGE AT MANY OF YOUR CO AUTHORS ON. THIS IS A KEY PIECE IN IT AND BEING ABLE TO STREAMLINE. BECAUSE AGAIN. WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF FOLKS ARE GOING TO COME INTO THE SYSTEM IF THEY'RE NOT MEDICATED THEY'RE GONNA BE. BACK IN. WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS. OR COMMIT A CRIME AND END UP IN OUR JAIL SYSTEM. ALL OF THOSE ARE NOT. IS NOT THE HUMANE WAY TO GO ABOUT TREATING PEOPLE OR THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE FOR CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EITHER.
