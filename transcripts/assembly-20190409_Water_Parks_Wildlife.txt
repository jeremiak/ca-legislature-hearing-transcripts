A MEMBERS AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT WILL STRENGTHEN LONG STANDING LAWS AIMED AT PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S WILD AND DOMESTIC HORSES FROM SLAUGHTER. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT VOTERS PROP PASSED PROPOSITION SIX WHICH MADE THE SLAUGHTER OF HORSES FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND THE SALE OF HORSE MEAT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA. BOB SIX ALSO PROHIBITS FORCES ZEALOT SITTING HORSES OUT OF OUR STATE FOR SLAUGHTER TO OTHER STATES OR COUNTRIES FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. DESPITE THIS EXISTING STATE LAW COURSES IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO BE ACQUIRED AT AUCTION OR THROUGH SALES THE END UP IN THE SLAUGHTER PIPELINE. THIS ISSUE WAS PUT ONTO OUR RADAR LAST FALL WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEGAN ROUNDING UP. WILD HORSES ON FOREST SERVICE LAND IN PROPOSED PUTTING THEM UP FOR SALE WITH WITHOUT LIMITATION. I WHICH MEANS THEY COULD END UP BEING SLAUGHTERED. TWENTY TWO OF OUR FELLOW LEGISLATORS INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN IN ATTORNEY GOOD GENERAL HABIA BUT SERRA. ASKED THE BUT PUT THE FOR FOR SERVICE ON NOTICE AND THUS FAR WE HAVE HELD OFF ON SUCH SALES. BUT THE THREAT TO HORSES REMAIN. LAST YEAR APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND AMERICAN HORSES BOTH DOMESTIC AND WILD WERE TRUCKED TO CANADA AND MEXICO WITH THEIR CRUELLY SLAUGHTERED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT MEMBERS CALIFORNIA'S DO ALL WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR FORCES FROM SUFFERING THE STATE. AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT WILL STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR COURSES IN THREE WAYS. FIRST IT WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON TO HAVE IMPORT EXPORT CELL BY GIVE AWAY HOLD OR ACCEPT ANY COURTS FOR SLAUGHTER FOR ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE PURPOSE. SECOND YOU'LL CREATE A FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE TO PURCHASE SUPPORTS FOR SLAUGHTER BY REQUIRING THAT ALL HORSES SOLD AT PUBLIC OR PRIVATE AUCTION BE SOLD AT A PRICE THAT IS ABOVE THE CURRENT SLAUGHTER PRICE. THIRD IT WILL ACQUIRE ANY PERSON PERSON'S PARTS IN OF COURSE AT A CALIFORNIA LOOK OR PRIVATE AUCTION TO BE TO SIGNED A SWORN STATEMENT ACKNOWLEDGING AND GREEN TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW. PROHIBITING THE SALE OR RESALE OF COURSES FOR SLAUGHTER FOR ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE WITH ME THIS MORNING MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN IS THE TO TESTIFIED SUPPORT ISSUES AND WHY AMERICAN HORSE CAMPAIGN. AND MAKING GAINS THE MAYOR OF THE OXEN HORSES RESCUE. BUT PLEASE WITNESSES A SUPPORTER REMEMBER WE GOT A TWO MINUTE TIME YEAH I LOVE IT HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GALLAGHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. ONE TWENTY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN WILD HORSE CAMPAIGNS THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA MEMBERS AND SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLLOWERS AND SUPPORTERS NATIONWIDE. I'D LIKE TO THANK MR GLORIA AND CO AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WALDRON BLOOM BURNER **** BATH CERVANTES CHOI A KALRA LEVINE SENATORS CHIANG PORTANTINO AN HERTZBERG. THE IMPETUS FOR THIS BILL DID COME FROM THE MODOC NATIONAL FOREST THREATENING TO SELL WILD HORSES WITHOUT LIMITATION ON SLAUGHTER THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SOLD WILD HORSES WITHOUT LIMITATION ON SLAUGHTER. SINCE THE WILD HORSE ACT WAS PASSED TO PROTECT THEM IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THE SITUATION HIGHLIGHTED THAT MANY CALIFORNIA HORSES ARE STILL IN DANGER OF SLAUGHTER DESPITE PROP SIX PASSED BY VOTERS IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT MAKING FOR SLAUGHTER FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION A FELONY UNDER STATE LAW. AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT WILL A LINE CALIFORNIA LAW WITH THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION ON SELLING WILD HORSES FOR SLAUGHTER. MAKING IT CLEAR THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON TO HAVE THE IMPORT EXPORT CELL BY GIVEAWAY HOLD OR ACCEPT ANY HORSE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR SLAUGHTER FOR ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE IT WILL REQUIRE A MINIMUM BID FOR ALL COURSES SOLD AT AUCTIONS SAID ABOVE THE CURRENT SLAUGHTER PRICE. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE APPROACH OF CALIFORNIA THOROUGHBRED OWNERS MAKING IT AN ECONOMICAL FOR KILL BUYERS TO OPERATE HERE. AND IT WILL UPDATE THE SIGNAGE WARNING AT AUCTIONS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF FOR SLAUGHTER AND REQUIRE ANY PERSON PURCHASING HORSES AT AUCTION TO SIGN A SWORN STATEMENT AGREEING TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW. WE'RE WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS WHO WANT TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S HORSES ARE SPARED THE MISERY OF TRANSPORT AND SLAUGHTER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ADDRESSING ANY ISSUES THAT. MAY ARISE AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND URGE YOU RESPECTFULLY FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. AT GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN GALLAGHER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT AND SPECIAL THANKS TO SOME WOMEN GLORIA -- FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. I RUN OPTION HORSES RESCUE EIGHTY CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT BASED IN LOS ANGELES AND I'VE BEEN ON THE FRONTLINES RESCUING IN NETWORKING MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED HORSES. FROM CALIFORNIA AUCTIONS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN MY RESCUE WORK IS TAKING ME TO SEVEN AUCTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. DESPITE THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIX THE PURCHASE OF HORSES FOR SLAUGHTER CONTINUES TO BE BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR LOW AND HOARSE TRADERS. MANY FINAL HORSES TO KILL BUYERS WHO SELL THEM TO A THIRD PARTY OUT OF STATE. THE THIRD PARTY THAN SHIPS THE HORSES OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO BE SLAUGHTERED IN MEXICO OR CANADA -- I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR WORSE IS AT THESE AUCTIONS THE HORSES THAT ESPECIALLY BREAK MY HEART ARE THE LESSON HORSES CAMP PORTS IS EVEN THERAPY HORSES. ONCE LOVED INCLUDED ON THEIR DUMP WHEN THEY BECOME TO OLDER TO STORE AND SENT TO AUCTION THEN BETRAYED BY THE VERY PEOPLE LEAVE TIRELESSLY WORKED. FOR INSTEAD OF A SAFE RETIREMENT OR AT THE VERY LEAST HUMANE EUTHANASIA THESE POOR WORSE IS ARE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES AT AUCTION. THERE WERE SINCE PAST THEIR PRIME WITH VARYING ISSUES AND THEY'RE HEARTLESS WE SOLD WITHOUT HESITATION MOST WIND UP ON THE SLAUGHTER TRACK ANY SOURCES DID DESERVE SO MUCH MORE -- THIS BILL IS A MODEST APPROACH TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF COURSE IS GOING TO SLAUGHTER AND I BELIEVE IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AT THE MINIMUM BID REQUIREMENT FOR HORSE SOLD AT AUCTION WILL CREATE A SAFETY NET AND MAKE COURSE TRADING FOR SLAUGHTER. FAR LESS ECONOMICALLY VIABLE THE GOAL IS THAT THE PRICE EXCEEDS THE KILL BUYERS ABILITY TO MAKE A PROFIT. AFTER FACTORING IN TRANSPORTATION COSTS. THE SWORN STATEMENT IN BETTER SIGNAGE WILL PUT PEOPLE ON NOTICE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA LAW AND THE EXPANSION TO SLAUGHTER FOR ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE. WHICH WILL PRECLUDE ANY PRE HENCE OF COURSE IS GOING TO SLAUGHTER FOR NON HUMAN CONSUMPTION. AS I'VE SEEN ON A MONTHLY BASIS AT THESE AUCTIONS CALIFORNIA HORSES TRULY NEED YOUR HELP. I SINCERELY URGE YOU TO PASS AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT AND I THINK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND AGAIN HIS NAME ORGANIZATION IN OPPOSITION -- SUPPORT. GOOD.

OKAY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION DO NOT LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT SCIATICA. THE FIRST OKAY. GOOD AND PROCEED. AGAIN TWO MINUTES EACH. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS -- ROBERT SPIEGEL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION AND WE ARE OPPOSED IN WITH AMENDED ON MISTER GORE IF AB -- ONE TWENTY EIGHT AS WHAT WAS -- PUT TOGETHER IN A LETTER THAT WAS DELIVERED DID TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MONDAY AND AND CONVERSATIONS WITH US STAFF LAST WEEK -- WE DO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR COMMITTEE STAFF CHAIRMAN GARCIA THE SPONSORS -- TO ADDRESS ONE OF OUR LARGER CONCERNS WITH THE BILL WHICH WAS SECTION SIXTEEN AND AND MODIFYING PENAL CODE SECTION FIVE NINE SEVEN NO IS A RELATED TO THE SPECIFIC TRANSPORTATION OF ANIMALS DESTINED FOR SLAUGHTER WE APPRECIATE THOSE AMENDMENTS. AND CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS OF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD HOWEVER. THERE ARE STILL TWO BERRIES CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE EXISTS WITH THE EXISTING BILL -- HAVE DRAFTED -- FUNDAMENTALLY ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY IS A A LOT OF CONVERSATION AND CONCERNED ABOUT PROPOSITION SIX AND THAT THE EXPANSION FOR ANY AND EVERY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE WAS SOMETHING THAT THE INITIATIVE ESSENTIALLY CREATED A LOOPHOLE. THE FACT IS THAT PROPOSITION SIX IN AN OF ITSELF THE EXISTING PROPOSITION THE EXISTING LAWS THE LOOPHOLE THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT. PROPOSITION SIX IS NOT ENFORCED IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHY FORCES WERE STILL ARGUABLY BEING TAKEN TO SLAUGHTER. HAD CALIFORNIA PROVIDED ENFORCEMENT HAD CALIFORNIAN THE VOTERS ACTUALLY WANTED TO HAVE A FINER PENALTY FOR VIOLATION GREATER THAN THE PRICE OF AN IPHONE I THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN. MUCH MORE ENFORCEMENT ON THE ACTIVE FORCES BEING TAKEN ILLEGALLY OUT OF CALIFORNIA ON THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IN MY MEMBERS DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH EXPANDING THE PROHIBITION TO ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE WHEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SHOWN. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT WE HAVE NOT EVEN ABLE BILL WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENFORCE. THE FACT THAT HORSES ARE STILL BEING TAKEN FOR SLAUGHTER FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. IN TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION SIX ONLY TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE EVER BEEN CHARGED. WITH POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THAT INITIATIVE AND NONE OF THEM HAD SERVED ANY JAIL TIME IN ADDITION. EXCUSE ME IN ADDITION THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THIS LEGISLATION THAT CAUSES SOME CONCERN AND DEFINITELY SOME POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IS WHAT THAT RESERVE PRICE FOR THAT MARKET PRICE WILL BE. I THINK IT'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN AT LEAST TO THE SPONSORS AND AND TO THE AUTHOR FOR OFFICE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT THERE ISN'T REALLY A MARKET RATE THAT'S A MARKET RATE THAT'S DETERMINED BY EITHER THE UNITED STATES IS WHAT THE PRICE PER POUND. MAYBE FOR FOR STATE AND NOT SOMETHING THAT'S A PROBLEM AS WELL BUT SPECIFICALLY IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SETTING A RESERVE AT A PRICE FOR AUCTION. THESE AUCTIONS SIR DISTINCTLY TWO PURPOSES THE FIRST PURPOSES. THE ONE WHICH IS I THINK THE INTEREST OF OF THE SPONSOR IS WELL IF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TRYING TO SAVE AND RESCUE THESE HORSES IT IS TO PROVIDE THESE HORSES WITH THE BETTER CHANCE AND SECOND CHANCE OF LIFE. THE OTHER PURPOSE OF THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY THE REALITY THAT SUMMER FINDING THEIR WAY THROUGH THIS WATER PIPELINE. IF IN FACT WE ARE PUT ESTABLISHING A MARKET RESERVE A MARKET CAP. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE HORSES WHEN THAT RESEARCHERS AT MET? DO THEY GET ABANDONED DO THEY GET LEFT BEHIND ARE THEY STILL TURNED OVER TO SOME OTHER ENTITY FOR SLAUGHTER OR ARE WE ACTING AS A DISINCENTIVE FOR RESCUES. AND SANCTUARIES OR ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL INTERESTED IN BUYING THE HORSE TO ADOPT THAT HORSE I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IF WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS ESTABLISHING A MARKET PRICE. WHAT THAT MAYBE AND SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT COULD COME ABOUT -- I'VE TAKEN UP MOST OF MY TIME -- WE ARE AGAIN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR NO VOTE TODAY WE WOULD ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO LAY OFF THIS WEEK CAN YOU TO WORK WITH THE BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK WE'RE GONNA STEPS A QUORUM REAL QUICK -- BETTER QUICK TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. GALLAGHER HERE. BIGELOW. CHOI HERE. CHIU. KELLY YOUR FRIEDMAN. GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA. GLORIA HERE [inaudible] COLOR [inaudible] THREE OF US [inaudible] ROBERT RIVAS [inaudible] RUBIO. SALAS WOULD. AND I WANT TO WELCOME MISTER REAVIS SAID AND BELIEVE THE SUBSTITUTION IN TODAY. ON THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT SO WE'LL GO TO OUR NEXT WITNESS ANOTHER GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JOHN LEVEL -- AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF POLITICAL ANIMALS I AM ALSO TESTING NOT TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HORSEMEN'S ASSOCIATION -- AND FRIENDS OF ANIMALS. POLITICAL ANIMALS VIEWS THE ORGANIZATION THAT CREATED. WROTE. AND CAMPAIGN FOR PROPOSITION SIX SO WE WERE PRESENT. AT THE CREATION OF THE PREVIOUS WITNESS SAID SOMETHING WITH WHICH WE DO AGREE -- AND THAT'S THAT. BLOOM WITH PROPOSITION SIX HAS BEEN ENFORCEMENT. AND WE WOULD ASK OF THAT ALL OUR POSITION ON THIS BILL IS SUPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED. WE WOULD ASK -- FIRST OF ALL THAT THE BILL ACTUALLY FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT -- WE HAD EARLY ENFORCEMENT SUCCESSES WHEN PROP SIX WAS -- IN ACTED -- WORKING WITH THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY AT J. GOALS FROM KERN COUNTY -- THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ACTUALLY INSPECTED. TRUCKS AS THEY WERE LEAVING CALIFORNIA AND SURVEYED AS TO WHETHER THEY WERE BOUND FOR SLAUGHTER AND WAS ABLE TO TURN THOSE BACK. PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING -- WE THEN WENT TO SEE IF WE COULD GET THE HIGHWAY PATROL TO DO THAT BECAUSE FOOD IN AG FRANKLY -- LOST INTEREST WE THINK A BILL THAT HAS LANGUAGE IN IT. THAT DIRECTS THAT ALL HORSES BEING TRANSFERRED OUT OF CALIFORNIA. MUST BE INSPECTED AND CERTIFIED AND CLEARED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SLAUGHTER. BY EITHER FOOD IN A BAG OR THE HIGHWAY PATROL -- THAT IS A HUGE PIECE WE THINK THE OTHER PIECE THAT GIVES US PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL. IS THE CONFUSION IN THE BILL OVER -- THE MISDEMEANOR COUNT. OF FOR SLAUGHTER OF HORSES FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES. FIRST OF ALL CURRENTLY WE ARE UNAWARE OF OTHER ECONOMIC PURPOSES FOR WHICH SLOW HORSES ARE SLAUGHTERED. THEN FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION -- BUT IF THE LAW WERE TO GET IT OR IF ECONOMIC PRACTICES WERE TO EVOLVE OR DEVOLVE. OF WHERE -- HORSES WERE SLAUGHTERED FOR OTHER HUMAN CONSUMPTION TO US THERE IS NO EXCUSE NONE AT ALL. FOR MAKING THAT A MERE MISDEMEANOR WHICH REALLY BECOMES A LICENSE FEE FOR SOMEONE WHO SEES AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT. THE OLD THE PENALTY LANGUAGE SHOULD TRACK THE FELONY LANGUAGE THAT COULD CURRENTLY EXISTS WITH PROPOSITION. SIX WE AFTER A LOT OF BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS ON THE FLOOR. TO ENACT PROPOSITION SIX MANY OF THE ANIMAL ESTABLISHMENT GROUPS -- HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES PETER STATE OUT OF THE PROP SIX CAMPAIGN EVEN THOUGH THEY LATER CLAIM CREDIT AFTER IT PASSED -- BUT WE ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF ANY. UNINTENDED -- UNDERMINING OF OF PROPOSITION SIX AND WE ARE WE ARE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY SLAUGHTER OF HORSES FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES IS A MISDEMEANOR. BUT SLAUGHTER OF HORSES FOR HUMAN PURPOSES IS A FELONY THEY ALL SHOULD BE FELONIES -- A AND THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT THAT CREATES LIVES IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGES IT DOES CREATE. A CONFUSION -- I KNOW THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT SAYS THAT THE PENALTY PROVISIONS FOR ECONOMIC SLAUGHTER WILL NOT APPLY TO SLAUGHTER. FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION -- BUT THAT VERY AMBIGUITY STEEL INVITES MISCHIEF BY THOSE WHO WANT TO UNDERMINE -- PROP. SIX MR LEVEL I GOTTA WERE OVER TIME HERE SO I WAS GONNA READ MAY FROM ASIA VOTE FOR ANOTHER FORTY OKAY. OF WHAT JUST ONE FINAL NOTE YES GO AHEAD I DO WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE AUTHOR FOR OUR LATE OPPOSITION BUT WE ONLY FOUND OUT. ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL LAST WEEK BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. TOWARD ENACTING A BILL THAT REINFORCES PROP SIX RATHER THAN ONE THAT INADVERTENTLY MAY UNDERMINE IT. OKAY. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. THE MORNING -- MISTER CHAIR. THEY JUST ALL FILLED WITH CALIFORNIA ALLEN SAYS HE DID NOT HAVE THE BILL BUT I DO WANNA. THANK YOU I DO WANT -- TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE FOR TAKING COMMITTEE MINUTES AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR DRAFTING THOSE AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE THE TRANSPORTATION PROVISIONS OF THE BILL I ALSO DO WANT TO SAY VERY BRIEFLY -- THAT -- WILD HORSES ON THE MODOC NATIONAL FOREST ARE THE APPROVED MANAGEMENT LEVEL THAT SET UNDER THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT AND SO WE ARE OPEN TO WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY CONGRESS TO POOR SERVICE. AND SPONSOR THIS BILL TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON MANAGEMENT BECAUSE ARE SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE THAT IS DONE -- WITHOUT ADDRESSING A PROBLEM SO. THE AUTHOR AND YOU KNOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER OLD BILL OR ANY OTHER. OPPOSITION OKAY I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES MISTER DALI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL IMPACTS ON MY DISTRICT A VERY CLOSE TO MY HOME. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANY MEMBER THAT WANTS TO COME TO MY DISTRICT AND SEE THE WHEN WE ARE FACED WITH IT IS BASICALLY. IT'S CRAZY THAT WE HAVE AS A MISTER ALL FILLED -- MENTION WE HAVE A 1000% MORE HORSES ON OUR RANGE. THAT WERE ANTICIPATED TO BE THERE AND WE ARE IN A DILEMMA WITH. THEM STARVING THEY'RE ALL KINDS AND WE'VE WE'VE TRIED YES MA'AM COMMON SEE HAPPEN AND SO -- THERE THERE'S STARVATION THERE OVER POPULATED THEY ARE DOES DEVASTATING THE LANDSCAPE AND SO WE ARE IN A IN A PROBLEM THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON ADOPTION PROGRAMS. THROUGH THE NOT ONLY THE DOUBLE THIS GARDEN BUT THE SUSANVILLE WILD SANCTUARY AND SO THE THE CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT -- I THINK IT'S WELL INTENTIONED BUT IT'S GOING TO PUT YOU HAVE SOME PROBLEMS -- FOR ACTUALLY MANAGING A COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO DO IT SO I WILL BE OPPOSING THE BILL TODAY I KNOW THE AUTHOR. IS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE PROTECT -- NOLLIE THAT HOPEFULLY THE HABITAT AND THE DEVASTATION IS HAVING IT THERE BUT TO GIVING US A PATHWAY TO GET THESE HORSES ADOPTED IN IN A PIPELINE THAT WHERE. IT'S MAKES SOME SENSE BUT THE STATE WE'RE IN TODAY IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS ALONG WITH. TRYING TO MAKE DECENT POLICIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE -- AUTHOR TO WORK WITH -- THE CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION -- AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO ARE TRYING TO AUCTION THEIR HORSES -- NATURALLY THROUGH A PROCESS WE'RE GOING FROM -- NOT FOR CONSUMPTION -- MAKE OF IT SO THAT USABLE AND WORKABLE FOR THE PEOPLE ACTUAR IN THE INDUSTRY SO -- HOW WE OPPOSE YOUR LEGISLATION A AND I ENCOURAGE COME OUT ON THE GROUND AND I CAN TAKE YOU TO PLACES WHERE YOU? THERE'S THERE'S THEIR DEVASTATING THE RESOURCE NUMBER ONE AND IT'S DOES NOT A NATURAL STATE WHERE THERE'S ABILITY BILL TO USE THE RESOURCE AND AND MAKE IT TO SOMETHING THAT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY -- SETS FREE INSENSITIVE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS IS. OKAY AND SO THAT IS A DO PASS WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON THE AUTHOR I HEARD YOU STATE YOUR TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CORRECT. YES SIR OKAY -- SO MOVED AND SECONDED -- DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT. YEAH GO AHEAD. SO THERE WILL BE A LITTLE OFF TOPIC BUT I WANTED TO JUST PICK YOU BACK ON SOMETHING THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY SAID I'M I'M A LONG TIME FOR SOONER AS MANY OF YOU KNOW LIFELONG HORSE OWNER AND ADOPTING HORSE OUT AS MUCH HARDER THAN ADOPTING A DOG OR A CAT OUT. IT TAKES A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO THE TURKEY OF KEEP FORCES AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS. IS JUST PRICE OF HAS BEEN GOING UP -- AS WE CHANGE OTHER CROPS -- YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL THINK ABOUT IS IF WE REALLY CARE ABOUT GETTING THESE HORSES ADOPTED OUT IS FINDING WAYS TO BRING THE COST OF SOME OF THAT HORSE OWNERSHIP DOWN SOMEHOW. IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF LAND -- IN A LOT OF PLACES WHERE PEOPLE COULD KEEP COURSES IN THE PAST EVEN NO I REPRESENT RANCHO BURBANK AND RANCHO GLENDALE AND WE'RE LOSING YOU KNOW EVERY DAY WE LOSE ANOTHER COURSE KEEPING HOUSE SOMEBODY PUTS A SWIMMING POOL IN THE BACKYARD TAKES A STABLE OUT THAT NEVER COMES BACK. AGAIN SO MAYBE THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW LAMBLEY JUST SOMETHING FOR US ALL TO THINK ABOUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE REALLY WANT TO GET THESE HORSES ADOPTED THANKS.

AB FIVE TWENTY SEVEN RELATING TO ALLIGATORS AND CROCODILES AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY DESCRIBE PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM NON ENDANGERED ALLIGATOR AND CROCODILE PARTS OR PRODUCTS. USING THOSE PARTS WILL BE PROHIBITED FOR SALE IN OUR STATE AS OF JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THE PRO WHO BISSCHEN HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY PREVIOUS LEGISLATION AND AB FIVE TWENTY SEVEN SIX TO PROVIDE ANOTHER TEN YEAR EXTENSION TO THAT PROHIBITION. SIMILAR TO AB TWENTY SEVENTY FIVE WHICH PASSED THIS COMMITTEE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS A BOTH ALLIGATOR CROCODILE CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND ANY USE OF ALLIGATORS AND CROCODILES FOR LEGITIMATE FARMING A MEDICAL RESEARCH PURPOSES. HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE LAST EXTENSION WAS PASSED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN AS OUR WITNESSES HERE WILL POINT OUT ADVANCE IS A BIT MADE AN INFLAMMATION OF BEST PRACTICES WITH AN ALLIGATOR FARMS AND MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS BOTH AND FARMING EFFORTS AND IN THE WILD. ALLIGATORS OR CROCODILE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE ALLOWED INTO THE US IT IN THE CALIFORNIA OR NEITHER ENDANGERED NORTH THREATENED BY EITHER THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. OR THE U. N. ENVIRONMENT WORLD CONSERVATION MONITORING CENTER. FURTHERMORE WHILE POPULATIONS OF ALLIGATORS IN THE US ARE THRIVING. A TWENTY SEVENTEEN SURVEY BY THE LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES AND WILDLIFE ESTIMATED THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER TWO MILLION ALLIGATORS LIVING IN LOUISIANA. THE LEGITIMATE ALLIGATOR FARMING INDUSTRY IN THE U. S. PROVIDES MANY JOBS AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATES WHERE ALLIGATOR FORMING OCCURS ADDITIONALLY IT SUPPORTS MANY. RETAIL JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FAILURE TO PASS THIS BILL WE HAVE MANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ONE CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT HAVE HELPED ALLIGATOR A CROCODILE SPECIES ACHIEVE THEIR RECOVERY WILL LOSE IMPORTANT FUNDING. SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE FARMING INDUSTRY MANY JOBS IN THE STATES WHERE FARMING OCCURS WILL BE SEVERELY THREATEN AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THOSE FARMS. RETAIL JOBS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE THREATEN PLUS TAX INCOME. IMPORTANT SOURCES OF RESEARCH FOR BOTH CROCODILIAN AND HUMAN HEALTH A LIGHT ON WILL BE EITHER LOST OR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. FINALLY THE ANALYSIS FOR A. B. FIVE TWENTY SEVEN POINTS OUT THE NEED FOR A SUNSET. VERSES A TOTAL ELIMINATION OF THE CURRENT BAN. AS RECENTLY AMENDED A. B. FIVE TWENTY SEVEN DOES JUST THAT. AND I WILL. RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THIS FOR AN AYE VOTE. TODAY WITH ME. IS THE PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR THIS BILL. THE GOOD SENATOR CABALLERO. AS WELL AS DOCTOR GRAHAM WEBB. DIRECTOR OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL IN A WORLD RENOWNED EXPERT IN THE CONSERVATION OF CROCODILIAN THIS AND DIRECTOR OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL AND DOCTOR HAVEA. NEVER AS VETERINARIAN FOR THE STATE OF LOUISIANA'S DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES. SIR CABALLERO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR A BI. FIVE TWENTY SEVEN AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS TRULY A BIPARTISAN ISSUE. IN EXPLORING THE ISSUE I WAS PERSUADED BY IMPORTANT FACTS RELATING TO THE AMAZING RECOVERY OF ALLIGATORS IN THE UNITED STATES ESPECIALLY IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA WHERE A MAJORITY OF THE FARMING OCCURS. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE STATE OF LOUISIANA ESTABLISHED A PROGRAM REGULATING THE FARMING OF ALLIGATORS IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE. AND MAINTAIN WETLAND HABITAT FOR THE ALLIGATORS THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SURVEY BY THE STATE OF LOUISIANA ESTIMATED THAT THERE WERE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND ALLIGATOR NESTS IN THE WILD HE SIX HUNDRED AND 50% INCREASE SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THAT WAS A SURVEY THAT ESTIMATED THE WHILE POPULATION TO BE AT ALMOST TWO AT TWO MILLION AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE REGULATED FARMING PROGRAM RESULTED IN FORTY NINE THOUSAND ALLIGATORS BEING RETURNED TO THE WILD. THE ABOVE NUMBERS POINT TO A VERY SUCCESSFUL SUCCESSFUL GOVERNMENT PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERSHIP IT IS HELP THE SPECIES NOT ONLY. TO SURVIVE TO FLOURISH AND FAILURE TO PASS THIS BILL WILL CLEARLY RESULT IN A THREAT TO THAT PARTNERSHIP BY IMPACTING THE ABILITY OF THE FARMS TO SURVIVE ECONOMICALLY. IT'S ALSO KEY TO NOTE HOW IMPORTANT ALLIGATORS HAVE BECOME FOR HUMAN MEDICAL RESEARCH THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS FOR THAT DEVELOPMENT. FIRST ALLIGATORS HAVE A NATURAL DEFENSE AGAINST BOTH CANCER AND BACTERIAL GROWTH. SECOND THEY ALSO HAVE IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL TRAITS THAT CAN SHED LIGHT ON WAYS TO HELP HUMAN TREAT HUMAN CONDITIONS. AND THIRD ALLIGATORS ARE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF HIDE HI HI EL HYALURONIC ACID YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT ON TV RIGHT -- A COMPOUND THE GREATLY ENHANCES THE HEALING OF WOUNDS YOUMANS. HUNDREDS OF UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING MANY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE USING ALLIGATORS IN HUMAN MEDICAL RESEARCH SEARCH. FOR ALL THESE REASONS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI FIVE TWENTY SEVEN AND AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR AND SO WE HAVE. TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE ORDER EITHER OKAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN JOE LAYING REPRESENTING PEACH. WHICH IS PROTECTING ENVIRONMENTS. ANIMALS COMMUNITIES AND HABITATS REAL QUICKLY WE HAVE TWO WONDERFUL EXPERTS HERE AND THEN WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I WOULD SPEAK FOR THIRTY SECONDS. ON THE RESEARCH EFFORT THAT THE CENTER CUBBY -- JUST OUTLINED OKAY [inaudible] GOOD. PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS IS. CRIME WAVE AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE BANG I WILL TO TESTIFY AND ALSO FOR THE BILL'S SPONSORS THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT BILL FROM A CONSERVATION POINT OF VIEW. I AM HERE FROM NORTHERN IN CHARLOTTE BUT REPRESENTING. THE STRUGGLE SPECIALIST GROUP OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF NATURE -- THE CORAL SPECIAL SCRIPT WHICH I CHAIR HAS SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR MEMBERS FROM SIXTY FOUR COUNTRIES. AND WE ARE DEALING WITH CRIMINAL CONSERVATION ISSUES JUST AROUND THE WORLD ALL THE TIME AND EVERY DIFFERENT CONTEXT. THE IMPERSONAL QUALIFICATION I'VE GOT A PHD DAYS SAY OF WRITTEN. I HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SCIENTIFIC PAPERS AND QUITE DEFINITIVE BOOKS ON CALL AT ALL AN ALLIGATOR MANAGEMENT. I'D LIKE TO POINT A AT THE CALIFORNIA ROLLED OUT DOESN'T HAVE A RESIDENT POPULATION OF CROCODILES HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE. INCREMENTAL CONSERVATION IN THE SIXTIES WHEN IT. IT WAS NOT A LEGISLATION WILL WHITE A BIT CROWDED HOUSE IT WAS LIKE ASTRIDE A ONE OF THE ONLY COUNTRIES TO BAN TRIED. AS A MECHANISM. FOR GETTING THINGS IN CONTROL. THAT IS CONTROLS TIME THEY CAME WITH THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES WHICH CAME INTO FORCE IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE WAS HOPING FOR FINALLY THEY BE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL. SINCE SAUDIS TIMING TO BANG BUT ALSO -- IN MANY COUNTRIES JUST BLOSSOMED UNDER. WHY IS MANAGEMENT? AND THERE AND NOW. EXAMPLES NOT JUST IN LOUISIANA WHICH IS ONE OF THE CLASSIC EXAMPLES IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN A I'M COUNTRY. THE CROWD -- POPULATIONS OF GONNA TWENTY TIMES IN ABUNDANCE A HUNDRED TIMES IN BY A MASH. AND THE EAST AND THE PUBLIC IS PUTTING UP WITH THEM WHICH IS BIZARRE BECAUSE THEY GET TWICE THE SIZE OF ALLIGATORS. THEY WAY YOU SIX MADE IS A LONG WAY TIME. AND EIGHT PEOPLE EVERY TIME THEY GET AN OPPORTUNITY YET THE PUBLIC LIKES AND BECAUSE THEY WELL MANAGED EVERYONE IS BENEFITING INCLUDING INDIGENOUS PEOPLE [inaudible] AND SO. I GUESS THE ONE THING THAT WE WANT THE WORLD TO SLANT DURING THIS PERIOD. IS THAT. TRIED. REGULAR IS HIGHLY REGULATED TONIGHT IT'S REGULATED IT ALSO TO TEASE ILLEGAL TRIED IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL TO DAVE OF THE LEGAL TRIED IS REPLACE THE LEGAL TRIED. AND THIS IS A WIN WIN SITUATION. AND PUTTING. THE MAKE SUNSET IN CLOSE IS THE PERFECT -- AND RESPONSIBLE -- WAY TO HELP CONSERVATION THE LIVELIHOODS OF PEOPLE IN MY OPINION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ON VIRUS I'M I PROFESSIONALS ILLEGAL MEDICINE A LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF THE TERM MEDICINE I'M A VETERINARIAN I ALSO HAVE A PHD IN THE TURNER SCIENCES -- I AM A DIPLOMAT OF BOTH THE AMERICAN AND THE EUROPEAN COLLEGE AS A LOCAL MEDICINE -- WITH A SPECIALTY IN REPTILE MEDICINE I'M FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS -- I HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE RESEARCH OP PROGRAM AS WELL AS A VETERINARY CARE PROGRAM OF THE ALLIGATOR INDUSTRY -- IN LUCIANA. DURING THIS TIME WE HAVE -- CREATE A BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE GUIDELINES THAT ESTABLISH DAY HUMANE CARE ON WELFARE OF THE ANIMALS IN CAPTIVITY OUR ANTI FOG THE AMERICAN THE TERM MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF EVEN ABOUT THAT SOME OF OUR GUIDELINES. FOR SOME OF THEIR OWN GUIDELINES WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ALLIGATORS AND GROUP OF DEALINGS -- WE HAVE A VERY ACTIVE ONGOING -- SCIENTIFIC A RESEARCH PROGRAM ON THE LOOK NOT ONLY AT THE HEALTH OF THE CAPITAL TO GET US IN THE FARMS BUT ALSO WHILE POPULATIONS ALLIGATORS. AND YOU KNOW THE 10% OF ALLIGATORS ARE BEING RELEASED BACK TO THE WILD EVERY YEAR I'M NOT 10% IS A BIG PART OF WHAT HELPS -- THEY WHILE POPULATIONS REBOUND -- TO THE RECORD NUMBER SO WE HAVE BEEN TO A WELL OVER TO MILLIONS -- WE HAVE A VERY VERY HEALTHY RIPOFF STABLE -- YOU KNOW POPULATION A WHILE THE GATORS IS A VERY STABLE NATURAL RENEWABLE RESOURCE -- THAT WE WORK WITH -- I'M THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH WITH SOME OF THE FROM A LOT OF FROM FISHERIES ALICE YOU THE UNIVERSITY FINALLY GET A FARMERS WE HAVE AN ON PRESIDENT THE COLLABORATION OF INDUSTRY AND THE FROM STATE AGENCIES WORKING TOGETHER TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL -- I'M THIS HAS BEEN -- RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR SUCCESS ALI GET A FARM IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXCESS OF ALLIGATORS -- I'M ON THE REBOUND THEY HAD IN NATURE -- THERE'S PLENTY OF EVIDENCE OUT THERE -- TO SUPPORT THAT A SUGGESTS THAT -- AND AGAIN THE NUMBER THAT. ARE GETTING AT THE END OF OUR SOME HERE SUPPORT OF THE BILL APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER LANG IF AT ALL AND TOLD YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REAL QUICKLY IS BOTH AUTHORS HAVE NOTED -- MEDICAL RESEARCH HAS FOUND SOME REALLY AMAZING DISCOVERIES RULING TAG ALLIGATORS. NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THEIR RESISTANCE TO CANCER AND BACTERIA BUT ALSO THEIR ABILITY TO REGENERATE TISSUE GROWTH AN ORGAN GROWTH. WHY IS THIS A BILL IMPORTANT TO THAT MEDICAL RESEARCH? BECAUSE IT'S THE LEGITIMATE FARMING OPERATIONS AND THAT WILDLIFE REFUGES THAT THEY SUPPORT THAT PROVIDE BOTH THE ALLIGATOR EGGS AND THE ALLIGATOR SPECIMENS FOR THAT RESEARCH. MINUS THE COMMERCIAL APPLICATION. THE PRICE OF ALLIGATOR SPECIMENS TO USE IN THAT RESEARCH WOULD LIKELY INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AND IN ALL THIS SPEAK QUICKLY ABOUT MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES YOU KNOW I'M INVOLVED IN RESEARCH. TO FIND A CURE FOR MY DAUGHTER'S GENETIC MUTATION. IN THAT RESEARCH WE HAVE TO USE LABORATORY MICE. THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL OPERATION SUPPORTING THE RAISING OF MICE AS A RESULT WERE WERE LIMITED TO BUYING THOSE MICE FROM LABORATORIES THAT RAISE THE MICE SPECIFICALLY FOR RESEARCH. AND THE COST ORIGINALLY WAS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MOUSE THAT THAT GIVES YOU THE SENSE OF WITHOUT THE COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF THE FARMS. THE SOURCE FOR THE REAGENTS FOR THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH WOULD BE VERY VERY EXPENSIVE -- FINAL POINT IN TALKING WITH SOME OF THE MMBERS. THERE HAS BEEN A QUESTION RELIEF REGARDING THIS BILL RELATIVE TO HOW DO WE ASSURE DURING THIS TEN YEAR EXTENSION. THAT IN FACT THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE IMPORTED INTO CALIFORNIA ARE ONLY THOSE THAT RESULT FROM LEGAL TRADE THAT'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TREATY -- WE ARE OPEN TO DISCUSSING THAT -- ME IN CLEARLY WITH THE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS IF THAT BE IF THAT'S AN IMPORTANT MOMENT. WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE AUTHORS WE WOULD BE OPEN TO ACCEPTING THAT AS A WAY TO ASSURE DURING THIS TEN YEAR PERIOD THAT. THE ONLY PRODUCTS THAT COME IN ARE THOSE THAT ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TREAT. I THANK YOU MISTER LAYING IN A APPRECIATE THAT IT'S NHà UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR PERSONAL. CONNECTION TO THIS AS WELL I THINK IS IMPORTANT IN. AND HOW THIS IS HELPING WITH WITH MEDICAL RESEARCH AS WELL. THE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HI MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKEDLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION THIS BILLS. BASED ON SOUND SCIENCE IN THE STATE OR YOU GONNA USE OF THE RESOURCE AND IT ALSO HAS GOOD WETLAND HABITAT BENEFITS SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MATT GRAY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE AND FISHERIESTHE SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. SHE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ALL OF IRAQ RIGHT CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION MANY OF OUR ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS RELY ON THIS SOURCE -- TO DEVELOP SOME OF THE THERAPIES THAT THEY'RE CREATING SOME INSTRUCTS PORT THANK YOU. IN THREE MILLION ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA GREEN IF YOU'D ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AND OVER ON BEHALF OF THEIR HEARING ALL HIGH AND WE MAKE THE VACCINE FOR WEST NILE FOR ALLIGATORS AND CROCODILES IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PLEASE COME ON UP. SURE [inaudible] PRESIDENT. YEAH GO AHEAD AND LET'S CLEAR THE TABLE HERE IS WE HAVE ENOUGH ROOM [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING. I'M JUDY MAY INCLUDE SO FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION. CALIFORNIA BANNED THE SALE OF ALLIGATOR CROCODILE BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOR THE NEXT THIRTY SIX YEARS THAT WAS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA BUT THEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE STATE OF LOUISIANA GOT A TEMPORARY EXEMPTION SIGNED BY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER. THAT EXEMPTION WOULD LAST UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY TEN THEN LOUISIANA CAME BACK TO CALIFORNIA AGAIN I GOT AN EXTENSION FOR THEIR EXEMPTION AND TELL THIS COMING JANUARY. AND HERE THEY ARE AGAIN TRYING TO INFLUENCE OUR LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR SPECIAL INTERESTS. TODAY WE ARE HERE TO REPRESENT THE SUPERMAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WANT OUR LAWS OF HELD. AN INDEPENDENT POLL EARLIER THIS YEAR SHOWED THAT WHEN CALIFORNIANS WERE ASKED IF THEY WOULD SUPPORT A BAN ON IMPORTING EXPORTING ARE SELLING AN EXOTIC HEIGHTS AND PRODUCTS MADE FROM ANIMALS. 75% SAID YES AND FOR THOSE OF INTEREST DEMOCRATS VOTED EIGHTY TWO POINT FIVE NO PARTY PREFERENCE SEVENTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT AND REPUBLICANS AT FIFTY EIGHT POINT. SEVEN SO PLEASE JOIN US VOTE NO ON THE VOEPEL BILL AND YES ON THE MAIN SHOWING BILL COMING UP NEXT. GOVERNOR'S WHAT SCHWARZENEGGER FELL SHORT OF CALIFORNIANS COMPASSION FOR ANIMALS MY GROUP SPONSORED A BILL IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE CARRY BY PEDRO NAVA. THAT WOULD HAVE CLAMPED DOWN ON PUPPY MILLS SCHWARZENEGGER VETOED IT LATER IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE DID A BILL THAT EVEN WENT FURTHER WHAT PATRICK O'DONNELL THAT KICKED PUPPY MILLS OUT OF PET SHOPS. AND NOT ONLY WAS IT SUPPORT IT WOULD BIPARTISAN VOTES AND SIGNED INTO LAW IT HAS SINCE BEEN CELEBRATED AND COPIED AROUND THE GLOBE LAST YEAR WE PROVE ONCE AGAIN WE'RE CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD WANTS TO BE ON PROTECTING ANIMALS. BY GETTING SENATOR GALGIANI IS BILLS OF SIGNED INTO LAW THE CALIFORNIA CRUELTY FREE COSMETICS ACT. THAT IS NOW GLOBAL LANDMARK LOUISIANA'S TIME IS UP PLEASE HELP US TO DEFEND AND RESTORE CALIFORNIA'S HISTORIC PROTECTIONS FOR THESE AND HOLES AND SAY NO TO THIS EXTENSION AND YES TO OUR EXISTING LAWS. THANK YOU. THIS MORNING MY NAME IS HANNAH SHINE I'M THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS FOR PEOPLE FOR THE ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. WHICH HAS OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND OUR AFFILIATES HAVE INVESTIGATED ALLIGATOR CROCODILE FARMS ON THREE CONTINENTS. I PERSONALLY TRAVEL TO ZIMBABWE TO DOCUMENT FIRSTHAND THE CONDITIONS AT TWO MASSIVE CROCODILE COMPLEXES. I ALSO HELP DIRECT AN INVESTIGATION AND AN ALLIGATOR MILL IN TEXAS WHERE ONE OF OUR FIELD OBSERVERS WORKED. PETER ASIA I WITNESSES VISITED MULTIPLE CROCODILE OPERATIONS IN VIETNAM. THESE WERE ALL MAJOR FACILITIES THAT SUPPLIED SKINS FOR BRANDS LIKE OUR MEN'S AND LOUIS VUITTON. EACH FACILITY CONFINED ANIMALS IN GRAHAM BARREN AND TOTALLY UNNATURAL CONDITIONS. IN VIETNAM AND MANY CROCODILES LANGUISH IN CELL SMALLER THAN THE LENGTH OF THEIR BODIES. THE OPERATION IN TEXAS KEPT ALLIGATORS AND DARK WAREHOUSES IN PITS OF PUTRID WATER THAT REEKED OF RANCID EXCREMENT. OUR OBSERVER STRUGGLED NOT TO VOMIT AS HE STOOD THIGH DEEP IN THE MURKY CESSPOOLS FEELING AROUND FOR YOUNG ALLIGATORS TO PICK UP. WORKERS THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO SHOOT THE ALLIGATORS IN THE SCHOOL WITH A CAPITAL CAPTIVE BOLT GUN TO RENDER THEM INSENSIBLE BEFORE SIGHING INTO THEM WITH BOX CUTTERS. BUT DURING OVER FIVE HUNDRED SLAUGHTERS THIS WAS NOT DONE. AND THEY CUT INTO ALLIGATORS NEXT AND SHOVED A ROD UP THEIR SPINAL COLUMNS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PATH OR SCRAMBLE THEIR BRAINS. THE MANAGER HIMSELF STAB FOR CONSCIOUS ALLIGATORS WITH A KNIFE TO DISLOCATE THEIR CERVICAL VERTEBRAE AS THE SUFFERING ANIMALS FAILED AND STRUGGLED. IN VIETNAM WORKERS ELECTROSHOCK CROCODILES IN ORDER TO IMMOBILIZE THEM. PACKED INTO THEIR NECKS AND RAMROD'S DOWN THEIR SPINES. NOT EVEN ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY THEIR BRAINS FIRST REPTILE EXPERT CLIFFORD WARRICK HAS STATED THAT THESE METHODS CAUSE SEVERE STRESS. TRAUMA AND PAIN. CROCKETT ALIENS ARE RESILIENT INTELLIGENT ANIMALS WHO SUFFER IMMENSELY WHEN THEY'RE CONFINED MISHANDLED AND SLAUGHTERED PLEASE DO NOT ALLOW THE TRADE OF THEIR SKINS AND REJECT AB FIVE TO SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISS VERY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING HERE ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE WHICH ALONG WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND OUR DC IN THE SIERRA CLUB URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB. FIVE TWENTY SEVEN THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY SPECIES OF ALLIGATORS CROCODILES CAME IN SYNC AERIALS PROTECTED UNDER SITE EASE THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES. THE PROTECTED EXPLICITLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THREATENED BY ILLEGAL TRADE THE SPECIES ARE ALSO IN DECLINED THREATENED BY EXTREME HABITAT LOSS AND OVER EXPLOITATION. CODE SIX FIFTY THREE OH IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SEXPLOITATION OF THESE IMPERIL WILD ANIMALS THROUGH TRADE. AND WE BELIEVE AB FIVE TWENTY SEVEN WHEN UNDERMINE THAT POLICY. OWN AND SAY THIS CHANGE ALLIES ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY ALLOW FOR THE COMMERCIAL SALE OF FARM ANIMAL PARTS AND SKINS. HOWEVER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIANS TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRODUCTS MADE FROM FARM TO WILD CAUGHT ANIMALS THE ANALYSIS INDEED QUOTES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN USING US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE RULING THAT STATED QUOTE. SMALL PARTS AND PRODUCTS OF CROCODILIAN LEATHER ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH MADE INTO GOODS THAT'S HAMPERING THE IDENTIFICATION OF LEGAL ALLIGATOR PRODUCTS FROM THOSE OF ENDANGERED OR THREATENED POCKET ALIENS PROBLEMS WITH IDENTIFICATION COULD INCREASE ILLEGAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED CROCODILIAN PRODUCTS AND QUOTE. MENTION ALSO THAT AB NINETY SIX CALIFORNIAS IVORY AND RHINO -- BAND PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED THE SALE OF TASKS AND TEETH FROM OTHER SPECIES OTHER THAN ELEPHANTS WALRUSES HIPPOS OTHER SPECIES BECAUSE THE LOOK ALIKES BECAUSE ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGES ON OUR COVER FOR THE ILLEGAL TRADE. A NEW ANALYSIS FROM DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE OF WILDLIFE SHIPMENTS COMING FROM LATIN AMERICA SEIZED BY THE UNITED STATES OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS REVEALS A TRAFFICKING IMPACT OF TRAFFICKING CRISIS IMPACTING CROCODILES. AND THE NEED TO STEP UP ENFORCEMENT AGAINST THE TRADE IN THEIR PARTS THE ANALYSIS FOUND THAT CERTAIN SORRY EXCUSE ME THAT CAME IN A CROCODILE SKINS ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMONLY SEIZE ITEMS. AND WE'RE TWO OF THE FIVE MOST ILLEGALLY TRADED ANIMALS ANOTHER TEN YEAR EXTENSION IN THE SALE OF FARMS PARTS SUGGEST THAT WE BELIEVE THE CRISIS AND ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE THAT IS FUELING THE EXTINCTION OF THE SPECIES IN THE WILD WORLDWIDE. HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IT HAS NOT IF ANYTHING CALIFORNIA-DRIVERS-PAY-UNDERFUNDED-STATE-PATROL-PENION ARGUMENTS WERE MADE IN FAVOR OF THAT LEGISLATION HERE WE HAVE SERIOUS EVIDENCE OF A THREAT TO THE VERY EXISTENCE OF SPECIES THAT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FARM REPTILES TO BE SLAUGHTERED IN MADE INTO LUXURY PRODUCTS. IF THERE IS INDEED SOMEONE THEY MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH THAT RESULTS IN AN FDA LICENSED PHARMACEUTICAL THEN A BILL COULD SEEK TO NEARLY ADDRESS THAT. IF YOU CAN VOTE TO PART MAMMALS FROM BEING TURNED INTO FOR PRODUCTS YOU CAN VOTE TO PROTECT CROCODILES AND ALLIGATORS FROM BEING TURNED INTO WALLETS AND SHOES. AND PROTECT THEIR EXTINCT AGAIN SIR EXTINCTION IN THE WILD OKAY THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU ARE HANDLED BOTH SIDES THERE BUT WE REALLY DO NEED TO KEEP ON TRACK GUYS HERE. SO OTHER WITNESSES IN PUBLIC IN OPPOSITION. THE CALIFORNIA AND I OPPOSE AB FIVE TO SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU PERFECT. HI MY NAME IS STACY SANDERS FROM GRASS VALLEY CALIFORNIA AND I OPPOSE AB.

SHERIN MONTU FAVORS CALIFORNIA OPPOSE THIS BILL. SAYS IN MATTER NOT LIKE HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] OKAY -- BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SO. BEFORE WE GET TO COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS IS IT APPEARS THAT WE HAVE AN AMENDMENT. BEING PROPOSED BY THE AUTHOR IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH SO I'M I'M. IT IS SO THE COMMITTEE KNOWS I THINK YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF IT THERE'S A PROPOSED AMENDMENT. THAT WOULD ADD PRODUCTS SOLD IN THIS STATE PRIOR TO THE PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN THIS SUBDIVISION WHICH ARE MADE OF WHOLLY OR IN PART FROM ALLIGATORS ACROSS IT AS SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A DISCLOSURE THAT READS AS FOLLOWS THIS PRODUCT WAS MADE USING MATERIALS SOURCED IN FULL COMPLIANCE. WITH THE PROVISION OF THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES. SO THAT IS WHAT THE AUTHOR IS PROPOSING AS A MEMBER OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD HAVE. HE OF THERE HAVE TO BE IN A MAN -- PROPOSED MOVE AS AMENDED -- TO PASS THAT BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID ALL. COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME YES. MR BIGELOW. YEAH -- WELL LET'S LET'S TAKE THAT ON FIRST WHAT IS SOCIETIES AND FIRST EXPLAIN THAT TO US -- AND THE SECOND PART WOULD BE. HOW IS SOCIETY'S HELP THE POPULATION WORLDWIDE? MAYBE YOUR EXPERTS IN THAT FIELD COULD. HELP. US UNDERSTAND THAT. REQUEST PERMISSION TO BRING ON EXPERTS YEAH YEAH ABSOLUTELY. COME FORWARD SIR. DOCTOR I FORGET YOUR LAST NAME MELISSA. DR WEB YES GO AHEAD [inaudible] BUT IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND NINETEEN FIFTIES AND INTO THE NINE NINE SIXTY NINE OH FORTY K. TO BEG CROCODILES AND I WOULD. JUST HANDED IS A RESOURCE THAT NOBODY CARED A BIT. IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE HEAD TO CHALLENGE THE ARE YOU SEE AN LED THE CHARGING THIS. IT DROPPED THE DICK AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON TRIED. TO CONTROL TRIED. IN SOME OF THE SPECIES THAT WERE. IN TRIED BUT NOBODY CARED A BIT THAT EVENTUALLY LED. TO THE SAUDIS CONVENTION THE TEXT WAS AGREED IN WASHINGTON AND NINE SEVENTY THREE IT CAME INTO FORCE IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IT HAS A HUNDRED NINETY THREE PARTIES. AND HAS A A VERY COMPLEX SO. TO SYSTEM WITH THE RESPONSIBILITIES INVESTED IN THE PARTIES THEY ALL HAVE TO HAVE A MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY IN A SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITY. WHENEVER THERE'S AN EXPORT BY HALF THE ISSUE. NOT AYE ME AN EXPORT PAYMENT. BUT A DECLARATION THAT IT'S NOT DETRIMENTAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES IN THE WILD. SELECT COMES A OUT FROM THE EXPORTING COUNTRY IN THE USUALLY THE IMPORTING COMPANY. HAS TO ISSUE AN IMPORT PERMIT INDICATED SATISFIED SAY THERE'S SOME INCREDIBLY KEYS OF LEGISLATION. THE ANY OTHER THING WHICH TODAY IS FOR PERSONAL PRODUCTS IF YOU GOT A WALLET OR BUILT. MATCH COUNTRIES AGREED TO THE PERSONAL PRODUCTS RESOLUTION WHERE LED TO HAVE FULL PRODUCTS SHE KNEW PERSONAL THE TO CARRY YOU CANNOT SEND THEM YOU CAN CARRY WITH THEM. BECAUSE IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE TREATY AND EXPLAINED UNBELIEVABLY SUCCESSFUL WILL ONE THANK YOU MISTER REGULARLY OF SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONING I DO -- SO. ELABORATE ON HOW. SITE EASE HAS HELPED THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE WORLDWIDE. WITH CURRENT ALSO WHAT HAPPENED IS THE WHEN MAD DEPLETED. A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY HAPPY ESPECIALLY WITH THE BIG BIG SPACIOUS. BECAUSE THEY VERY DIETERS TO LIVE WITH AS THE CROW STARTED TO RECOVER. AND STARTED TO ATTACK PEOPLE IN A TACKLE OF STOCK AND AND THE THE SIRIUS PREDATORS THE CHANGE SHOULD EITHER THEY THEY THEY DON'T. NOT THE OLD THING IT SURELY THE NATURE. THE USE PROGRAMS WERE BROUGHT IN TONIGHT. SOME OF THOSE ANIMALS VALUABLE TO THE PLATE LIVE AFTER LEAVE WITHIN SAID IT. AND IT'S BEEN AN UNBELIEVABLE SUCCESS STORY IT'S COUNTER INTUITIVE TO SOME PEOPLE. THE USE OF AN ANIMAL GIVES PAVILION CHANGES TO TOLERATED MY PUT UP WITH A BIT. EL POPULATION THE ALLIGATOR POPULATION THEY'VE GONE UP. TWENTY TIMES IN ABUNDANCE AND A HUNDRED TIMES IN BY MANAGED TO SIGN TIME TIGERS OF GONE DOWN. ANOTHER 50%. IT IT'S JUST PEOPLE. IN MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. AND ECONOMIC INCENTIVE IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING SO I ON THE NUMBERS IN AUSTRALIA. THE NUMBERS IN AND TRY TO WIN FROM CHIMING IN IN THE NORTHERN CHARACTER ON FROM WENT FOR IRAN STREET SAY HOURS AND TWO HUNDRED SALES IN ANIMALS AND THE BOY AND MANAGE THE THREE THOUSAND A LOT OF THEM LITTLE SMALL ANIMALS THERE'S A LITTLE GROUP OF ADULTS. HAVING BABIES THAT POPULATION IS NOW BACK AT CARRYING CAPACITY IN A DEVELOPED COUNTRY WITH THESE ANIMALS. IF IF IF YOU GUYS SWIMMING IN THE RIVER NEXT TO WHERE I LIVE. YOU'LL BE KILLED 1100% IT'S A MATTER WHETHER IT HAPPENS IN FIVE MINUTES TEN MINUTES YOU'LL NEVER GET THE FIFTEEN DAYS OF THAT VERY DIFFICULT ANIMALS TO DEAL WITH THAT SO IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND NOW. AND THEN IN LOUISIANA WHAT'S THE REBOUND BEEN THREE BANDS BUT AT THE SAME THING I HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED SALES AND AT AT THE TIME ST LOUIS CAME IN THAT DAY ABOUT TWO MILLION OF IT TWENTY TIMES INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE. AND I WOULD SIGH I WOULD GUESS. A SEVENTY OR 80% INCREASING BY MAGIC NOT A 100%. AND FLOOR THERE'S BEEN A SIMILAR SITUATION ALSO FLOOR AND OTHERS WELL OVER TWO MILLION NOW SO IT'S NOT ONLY LUCIANA BUT THE PROGRAMS ALSO IN FLORIDA ON SOME OF THE OTHER STATES -- THIS ALL THESE TWO MILLION IN FLORIDA AND IN LOUISIANA YES SIR OKAY SO. YOU WOULD SAY THAT ALLIGATOR FARMS. HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR THE POPULATION. SO LET ME ASK THE QUESTION -- ALLIGATORS AND CROCODILES ENDANGERED. SO THAT THERE ARE SOME SPECIES THAT ARE IN DANGER HOWEVER -- A LUMBER A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT ENDANGERED ANYMORE. THE ONLY REASON TO HAVE RETAINING SOCIETIES IS BECAUSE SCIENCE HEALTH REGULAR THE COMMERCIAL TRAITS AS AN ADDITIONAL STATE MEASURE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE POPULATIONS NEVER GO BACK TO THE OLD DAYS -- BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE INSIDE IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY'RE THREATENED OR AND THEN YOUR WHAT SO EVER. ALLIGATORS WERE THE LEAST THAT -- IN THE SEVENTIES THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IN DANGER -- ON A CAR NOT ENDANGERED OR THREATENED. SOTALK TO ME ABOUT THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. WHAT IS ENDANGERED WHAT IS LISTED AS ENDANGERED CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT? A BILL OR WHAT HAS BEEN DELISTED OUR LEAD DRAMA DRESS ACCORDING. TO THE WHAT CONSTITUTES AN IN DYING COULD CROW IS ONE THAT THE POPULATION IS PLAYING HARLEY DEPLETED. THE ONE CITY IN THE COMBINATIONS OF COUNTRIES AND PRODUCTS THAT ARE. STILL CONSIDERED INDICTED. I WON SAID USUALLY HAVE NO COMMERCIAL VALUE AND DIED. DâN APPEARING TRIED IT'LL NONE OF THE TRIED AND SPECIES ARE EARLY. IN DYING FEED. H. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR US IN THE CRIMINAL SPECIALIST GREATLY CHARITY GET THE INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE THE SPECIES THAT. ALL RIGHT SO I HAVE NOT A COMMERCIAL VALUE THAT NOBODY'S INTERESTED IN NINE OF THE INJURY AS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WRITING ANY MONEY FOR THEM THEY THEY THEY IT'S A COMMANDER IS CAN UNDER MATT HEY I'LL BE A I'LL BE A GET THE RESOURCES. TO IT'S NOT THE ANIMALS THAT ARE IN TRIED THAT ARE THE PROBLEM REGULAR [inaudible] SO MAYBE. NOT SURE IF THE AUTHORS ARE ARE. THE BEST ANSWER THIS BUT MAYBE I'LL. DIRECTED TO YOU AND YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WAS THE BEST. WE SENT EXTENDED THE SUNSET AS IT WAS OF THE SPOKEN ABOUT HERE. AT TO WAIVE THE BAN ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND HERE WE ARE ONCE AGAIN. CAN SOMEBODY TELL US WHAT THE IMPACT ON ALLIGATORS OR CROCODILES HAS BEEN. AND WHAT WOULD WHAT WE LEARNED. CAN ANYONE TELL US WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED. SO ALL I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THAT SO -- SINCE THE LAST TIME THAT THE SONGS THAT WAS PASSED -- AGAIN WE HAVE IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE BEST PRACTICE MANAGEMENT. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE BEEN TRADE AND HUMANE -- ON WELFARE -- OF THE ANIMAL SYSTEMS BEEN LOOKED AFTER -- THERE'S SLAUGHTER AND EUTHANASIA GUIDELINES -- THE HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE INDUSTRY ON A FIVE DAY AMERICAN THE TERM MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS INCLUDED SOME OF THOSE GUIDELINES WITHIN SOME OF THEIR OWN. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS -- THERE'S ONGOING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES -- BYE BYE ALL USING THIS ON ON FLORIDA THAT ADDRESSES THE WILD POPULATIONS AS WELL AS DOING A RESEARCH STUDY ON THE HEALTH OF CAPTIVE ON WAS ON IT WAS OUR BEEN RELEASED TO THE WALL RIGHT NOW WE'RE CURRENTLY SOMETHING THE FOR THE SEASON TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE. AND THE THINGS THEY CAN AFFECT THE WALL POPULATION SOURCE MADE A BIG PUSH FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND DATA TO MAKE SURE THE THAT A STATEMENT OR KNOW THAT FROM THE WALL POPULATION THE SITE IS NEEDS WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN APPROVED. THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE SAME WAY AND WE GOT IT ALL THE DATA TO SUPPORT THAT. THANK I THINK MISFIRING YOU ALSO HAD A RESPONSE -- YEAH WHY DID I KNOW -- WAS GOING TO SAY DID YOU DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORS DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT AT ALL. AND IF NOT WE CAN GO TO MISS HEARING. OKAY MISS PERIOD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED OPPORTUNITY AGAIN I WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ANALYSIS WHICH I THINK SPECIFICALLY STATES THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH RESPECT -- TO GLOBALLY HOW THE SPECIES ARE BEING HANDLED UNDER SADIE'S TWENTY OF THE TWENTY THREE SPECIES IN THE ORDER COCKATIEL YES SEVEN ARE ENDANGERED AND FOR OUR VULNERABLE ACCORDING TO THE IUCN RED LIST WHICH ASSESSES CONSERVATION STATUS OF SPECIES AT A GLOBAL LEVEL -- I WOULD ALSO POINT BACK AGAIN TO THE NEW REPORT THAT WE JUST ISSUED SHOWING ILLEGAL TRADE FROM LATIN AMERICA IN SPITE OF SOCIETIES IN SPITE OF PROTECTIONS WE ARE STILL FINDING A HUGE ILLEGAL WHILE LIVING TRAFFIC ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING NETWORK AND THESE SPECIES ARE AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THAT. OUR TRAFFIC ILLEGALLY SO THAT'S IN VIOLATION OF CITIES AND OTHER LAWS EIGHTY PER 86% OF THE CAME IN ITEMS THAT WERE FOUND WERE SOURCE FROM THE WILD. 96% OF THE CROCODILE ITEMS ARE SOURCE FROM THE WILD SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A LEGAL THERE IS A LEGAL COVER CREATED BY THE FARM TRADE AND FARM ANIMALS IT WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE. DEMAND FROM THOSE PRODUCTS FROM ANIMALS THAT ARE IT RATE THAT ARE IN THE WILD AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO FOSTER THIS ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING ACROSS THE GLOBE WHICH IS THE THIRD LARGEST THE LEGAL INDUSTRY. AFTER GUNS AND DRUGS. BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE LEGAL TRADE AND IN YOUR YOUR FRIEND OF THE ILLEGAL TRADE BUT THE LEGAL TRADE HAS LED TO THE REBOUNDING OF THE SPECIES IN AUSTRALIA IN THESE TWO STATES RIGHT WERE INTERESTED ON HOW THEY'RE DOING ON A GLOBAL LEVEL. AND AGAIN WE BAND OVER MY QUESTION TO YOU IS YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THOSE THEY HAVE REBOUNDED IN FLORIDA LOUISIANA AND AUSTRALIA CORRECT. THAT'S NOT THE SAME I ADMIT THAT THEY SET THE CLAIM THAT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS ALL THE NATIONAL FIND A WORRY THEMSELVES ABOUT. THE HOW ARE THE SPECIES ARE FARING ON A GLOBAL LEVEL AND IT IS IT IS IN THE INDISPUTABLE THAT A TRADE IN AN ANIMAL SPECIES WILL DRIVE THE TRADE IN THAT SPECIES REGARDLESS OF SOURCE. SO IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE SPECIES ARE DOING GLOBALLY AND CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE TAKING OUR SUNSET RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY AND CHECKING IN ON THIS. WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT THIS IS A BAD IDEA BECAUSE THERE IS SHOCKING EVIDENCE THAT THESE CONTINUES TO BE SPECIES THAT ARE TRADED ILLEGALLY AROUND THE GLOBE. CAUSING THEIR PERIL ONE ONE READ AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POINT BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS AND I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT HARD FOR YOU TO ADMIT IS THAT WHERE WE HAVE HAD LEGAL TRADE THAT IN THESE AREAS THE POPULATION HAS REBOUNDED SIGNIFICANTLY THOSE ARE THE FACTS. MISTER KALRA. NUMBER LOWERED OF FINISH UP WITH COMMENTS SUGGEST YES MISTER BIGELOW THANK YOU JUST ONE MORE AND I DON'T KNOW IF VIDEO ONCE AT THIS TABLE. BUT COULD SOMEONE ADDRESS THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT THE GAINS IN TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY. FROM THE ALLIGATORS AND CROCODILES AS WE KNOW HOW. THEY HAVE AN ODD AN IMMUNE SYSTEM. THAT DOES THAT. REQUIRE MEDICINE. THEY HEAL THEMSELVES. CAN SOMEONE ADDRESS THE FACT OF THE VALUE AND WHAT THAT POTENTIALLY MEANS TO US IN GAINES. IN THEEND FOR THE HUMAN SOCIETY WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. TRULY BENEFIT SINCE THE CROCODILES ARE ON A RECOVERY. THEY WERE ABLE TO CHAU SUSTAINABILITY. AND NOW HOW WE CAN USE SOME KNOWLEDGE TO ACTUALLY HEAL OURSELVES MAYBE IN FIND CURES TO THINGS THAT WE NEVER DREAMED UP. I CAN ADDRESS THAT AUSTIN SO ON THEIR SUCH AN EVENT TO GET ON THE SANTA MARK MERSHON THE HOUSE OF THE AMERICA THE WORK LOOKING AT THE ANTI MICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF THEIR BLOG -- THERE'S A NUMBER OF THIS TOGETHER YOU MAY JUST SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE TO SAID THAT -- NUMBER INVESTIGATORS IN THE STATE ONLY SEE ANOTHER LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE -- YOU KNOW BEING A MINOR SPACES HAS BEEN RECENTLY THAT ALL THOSE AVENUES HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT IN IN ALLIGATORS -- THERE'S BEEN SIMILAR RESEARCH CONDUCTED SADDAM ON THE FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN REGENERATE LIMBS -- SO THE DODD BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH THAT'S CAUGHT IN ITS RESEARCH CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE -- WE'RE IN THE VERY VERY EARLY STAGES SO THAT WHEN IT COMES TO GROW WITH THE ALIENS RIGHT NOW -- THE PRELIMINARY DATA IT'S EXTREMELY PROMISING -- TO ANSWER A QUESTION WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK AND CONTINUE TO OPEN AVENUES FOR THAT TO HAPPEN SO WE DON'T HOLD BACK THAT DIVIDE MEDICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINE TO WHICH HE WANTS. SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT RESEARCH YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOUTH AND ICE THOSE ANIMALS DO YOU. OUT FOR SOME OF THAT RESEARCH YES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HARVEST THE ORGANS OF THE EVENT ON THE RESEARCH AND SOME OF THOSE RESEARCH SITUATIONS THEY HAVE TO HARVEST THE FRIEND CELLS FROM THE ORGAN SO THEY HAD TO HAVE TO BE EUTHANIZED. IN SOME CASES IN SOME CASES IT NOT ALL CASES NOT ALL CASES CORRECT OKAY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A DONOR AND THAT WOULD BE. POTENTIALLY A SOURCE POINT. SO THAT'S A GOOD THING CORRECT ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER BIGELOW AS KATHY MISTER KALRA I THINK THIS YEAR -- I YOU KNOW I I DO WHEN I'M LOOKING AT FOR FOR COUPLE THINGS COMMITTEE IS HEARD OF A NUMBER OF THOSE ALREADY THE SESSION -- END OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THAT POINT TO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AT LEAST OF THE MAJORITY -- HAS BEEN HEADING AND WE JUST HEARD AB FORTY FOUR RECENTLY -- BUT REGARDING OF THE FOR THE BANNING OF FOR A CERTAIN KINDS OF FOR WE HAD A BILL A LAST TO THE END OF THOSE A LOT OF CONVERSATION IN THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT TO IT ON CHAU BE HUNTING AND WAS DIFFERENT. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER CONSERVATION PROGRAMS ACTUALLY HELP -- VERSUS HUNTING PROGRAM SENDING LICENSES -- BUT HOW DO AS A VERSES ENVIRONMENTAL TOURISM -- AND WHAT HAS A GREATER IMPACT -- AND I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT. WHAT? CALIFORNIA VALLEY'S ARMOR OR CUT DIRECTION CALIFORNIA'S GOING IN AND I THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND THE MEMBERS OF IT AGAIN NOT EVERYONE CLEARLY WE DEFINITELY HAVE VERY VIGOROUS DEBATE IT'S A GOOD THING THAT WE DO -- BUT I I THINK THIS COULD THIS COMMITTEE HAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. AS TO THE DIRECTION THAT WE SHOULD BE GOING IN AND I LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS. YES THERE HAVE BEEN RESTORED POPULATIONS BUT WHY THOSE POPULATIONS NEEDED RESTORED BECAUSE IT WAS OVER HUNTING AND LOSS OF HABITAT. AND SO THAT'S WHY THERE WAS A PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH. NOW THE POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN INCREASED AGAIN IF HUNTING IS CONTROLLED AND THE HABITATS PROTECTED THERE WON'T BE A NEED FOR THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. AND SO -- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NUISANCE PERMITS -- SO THAT HUMAN POPULATIONS ARE ENDANGERED -- NOW THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILD ANIMAL WHICH NO ONE IS DISPUTING IS A WILD ANIMAL -- WILL CONTINUE TO THRIVE BECAUSE WHAT CAUSED ITS DEMISE WAS THE FACT THAT AS WAS MENTIONED -- BY SOME OF THE EXPERT TESTIMONY OVER DECADES DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE ALLIGATOR. ALLIGATORS UNTIL THE ROUND THE SIXTIES AND THAT'S WHERE WE SAW THE DIP IN THE THE THE DRAMATIC DIP IN THE POPULATION BECAUSE OVER HUNTING. AND SO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES AND AND DECIDE HE'S PROGRAM'S BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES THERE'S NOT A NEW THING SO PUTTING A LABEL SAYING THAT THERE'S APPROVED BY SITE IS WELL THAT'S BEEN THE CASE FOR MANY DECADES -- BUT MY MY BUT THE POINT BEING IS THAT THE ONLY REASON WHY THERE WAS A PREDICAMENT AND IS A PREDICAMENT. REGARDING -- IN SOME SOME AREAS OF THE WORLD THAT DON'T HAVE. OF THE THE DESIRE TO BE POPULATE -- THERE'S BEEN A DESTINATION BECAUSE OF THE RETAIL DEMAND AND THE AND THE AND THE THE THE THE EXPORTING INTO. NATIONS LIKE THE US AND OTHER PLACES THAT HELLO BY THE THE RETAIL PRODUCTS. AND SO. I THINK BOTH IN TERMS OF PROTECTION OF THE SPECIES THIS IS TO SUGGEST THAT THE ONLY WITH THIS PIECE TO BE PROTECTED AS OF THIS PRACTICE CONTINUES EXIST. I'VE I I DON'T SEE THAT AS A AS A FACTUALLY CORRECT STATEMENT GIVEN THE FACT THAT. THE THE GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE NOW COULD PUT IN PLACE MUCH STRONGER HUNTING PROHIBITIONS WE COULD PUT IN PLACE. HABITAT PROTECTIONS AND THE LASTING ALSO ON HABITAT IS TWENTY SEVENTEEN SURVEY DOES INDICATE A DRAMATIC INCREASE THANKFULLY FOR THE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE SURVEYS EXEMPT PERCENT. CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE INTENTIONAL ACTIONS -- BUTTON THAT THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE BY LOUISIANA AND OF FLORIDA. APPARENTLY I HAD BEEN WORKING. BUT BUT IF YOU NOTICE A 12% DEPT DUE. TO TROPICAL STORM CINDY AND I MENTION THAT BECAUSE HABITAT AND THE PROTECTION HAPPEN HAS WILL BE MUCH MUCH MORE DIFFICULT I THINK WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON PROTECTION OF THE HABITAT. AND THE RESTAURANT AND AND NOW THE POPULATION'S BEEN RESTORED -- CONTROLLING AND AND ENSURING THAT THERE'S NO HUNTING EXCEPT FOR NUISANCE. AT THOSE TWO THINGS ARE DONE I THINK THAT THE THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN REALIZED OVER ABOUT A HALF PERCENT FORTY TO FIFTY YEARS. AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THOSE THE INSTITUTE THE PROGRAM AND GRATEFUL TO THOSE THAT DID THE HARD WORK TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. BUT THERE'S NO NEED FOR CALIFORNIA -- TO DO ANYTHING BUT ALLOW OF THE ALLOW THE SUNSET TWENTY TWENTY AND LET'S MOVE FORWARD -- AS A STATE IN THAT DIRECTION SO I WILL WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THIS TIME IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER ELABORATION REGARDING THE ABSOLUTE NEED FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES -- THEN THAT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF THE BILL AND WE CAN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT THANKS. MR GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WHICH WE I THINK WE ALWAYS DO A BIT MORE BILL FACTOR AROUND HERE AND JUST PUSH THINGS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT DON'T ACTUALLY OF A CONVERSATION. AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I FIND MYSELF -- BE ABLE TO RELATE TO BOTH SIDES OF THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE AND WHICH WE SEEM TO BE A BARE MINIMUM FOR EVEN ENTERTAINING OF DISCUSSION. IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER EVER WAS IMPORTED FOLLOW THE STRICTEST OF OF OF RULES ALTHOUGH THIS HEARING MAKES A GOOD POINT ABOUT. THIS DOESN'T EVEN WITH THIS IN PLACE ARE STILL TREMENDOUS TRADE FOR WHICH WE SHOULD ALL HAVE CONCERN AND SHOULD NOT BE COMPLACENT -- THAT SAID -- I I THINK THERE'S OTHER SORTS OF METRICS THAT I THINK ARE WORTHY OF DISCUSSION OF AS WAS MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE. YOU LEARN THANK YOU THE GRADUATE SCHOOL READY TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY RIGHT SO THERE'S TWENTY COMING HERE TWENTY THREE WAS IN THE CANADIAN HOUSES. DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ALLIGATOR SOME OF WHICH ARE IN DANGER SOME OF WHICH ARE AT RISK RIGHT. AND I WONDER WHY WE WOULD BE. FOR CONSISTENCY'S SAKE SUPPORTING THE IMPORTATION OF OF AT LEAST PORTIONS OF THIS -- OF CROCODILES AND ALLIGATORS THAT ARE ENDANGERED -- THAT THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE. NOT SOMETHING WE'D WANT TO SUPPORT IS CALIFORNIA ABOUT THEIR PORTIONS THAT ARE NOT -- AT RISK IN THERE FOR MAYBE A MORE DYNAMIC THOUGHT IS IT IS WORTH WHILE THEY'RE DRIVING I STRUGGLE WITH IN TERMS OF THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD MENTION. OF THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS -- OF ACROSS OF THIS SPECIES FOR HUMAN -- RESEARCH -- AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY FOLKS I LOOK TO ON THIS ISSUE CAME IN SUCCESSOR SUPPORT FOR THIS THAT'S NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- MY STAFF'S OF COURSE REVIEW REVIEW OF WAS TRYING TO FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- SOME OF THE COMMENTS CRITICALLY FROM THE LOUISIANA DELEGATION -- IN SUPPORT OF THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION REFERENCES -- EATING WERE AT LOUISIANA LOUISIANA ALLIGATORS AND TALK ABOUT BAGS AND WALLETS BUT NOT TALKING ABOUT RESEARCH -- WHICH IS AN IMPEDIMENT FOR ME GETTING WHERE I'D LIKE TO BE OUR I THINK WE'RE SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BE ON THIS BILL -- IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE THE ALLIGATOR EGGS ARE PERHAPS MORE HELPFUL -- IN THERE PRETTY KEEP THERAPEUTIC USES -- AND I'M CONFUSED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE A THE IMPORTATION OF THE EGGS IS ALLOWED UNDER THE CURRENT BAND -- IF IF THIS LEGISLATION WAS NOT PASSED. TO SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT. PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT ARE THE ANIMAL A OR THE CROCODILE EGGS. BUT GETS IN A MORE EGGS ARE THE ONLY A THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT THAT'S HERE. I'VE SEEN THE SHAKING OF HEADS AND NOW NOW THAT ONE OF THE DOLLARS WILL BE CORRECT THAT THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS COME -- IN A LARGE PORTION FROM THE BLOOD OF THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES A LOOK AT A DIFFERENT ON THE BODIES AND DIFFERENT PROTEINS ARE IN THE BLOOD PRODUCT OF THE ANIMAL SO WOULDN'T BE JUST THE AG. IS THE BLOOD PROHIBITED UNDER THE BAN ON IS A PART OF THE ITEM ALSO IF I'M CORRECT US AS THE STATE NOW ANY PART. OF THE BODY OF THE ANIMAL WE PROHIBITED SO ON THEIR SITE IS FOR EXAMPLE BLOOD IS A PART OF THE ANIMAL SO YOU CAN EXPORT BLOT WITH A PERMITS -- IT CAN EITHER SPEAK. TO ANYTHING THERAPEUTIC WITH. IT IS I UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT BAND DOES NOT PROHIBIT -- LIVE BIG FROM BEING IMPORTED. OKAY SO EGGS ARE PERMITTED BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY QUESTION THE ANIMAL THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR HUMAN RESEARCH CORRECT AND A COPY OF WITH AXES IT DEPENDS ON THE AGE OF THE AG TO BECAUSE AT A CERTAIN AGE IS GOING TO BE A LIVE AMBER INSIDE THAT ACT. SO YOU HAVE A LIVE ANIMAL. JONATHAN LOUISIANA. ABOUT THIS DEGREE YEAH THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER. REGARDING THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS THEY'RE SIX TYPES OF THE EIGHT CAN DO DOES THAT IT TREATS -- WE CIRCULATED AROUND A PICTURE OF A PATIENT WHO HAD FLESH EATING BACTERIA CONSUMING HER NECK AND THE UPPER TORSO AREA AND WITHIN TWO MONTHS IT WAS TREATED WITH THE ALLIGATOR SELVES. AND IT WAS -- CURED AT THAT TIME -- THERE'S HEPATITIS -- HIV WIND WAS TREATED AT AN IN VITRO LEVEL WERE KILLED 50% OF THE HIV VIRUS WITHIN ONE HOUR OF TREATMENT THAT'S STILL A LONG WAYS FROM AN ACTUAL -- SERUM HOWEVER -- IT IS PROMISING HERPES SIMPLEX ONE STAFF INFECTION MERCER HER ALSO TREATED WITH THIS RIGHT NOW DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS LOOKING AT THIS AS A WOUND TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE FOR OUR VETERANS WERE IN AFGHANISTAN AND OTHER AREAS -- BECAUSE THE BACTERIA IS IN THOSE AREAS ARE ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO TREAT WITH TRADITIONAL ANTIBIOTICS -- THERE ARE ALSO TWO TYPES OF PNEUMONIAS WHICH ARE BEING TREATED -- THERE'S ALSO OSTEOPOROSIS OUR OUR STORE OF THEIR IDEAS WHERE. THE CORTISONE TREATMENTS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY DETERIORATING TISSUE -- ARE NOT AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY THE HYALURONIC ACID WITHIN THE ALLIGATOR MUSEUMS. SO THEY'RE ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT TYPES OF HUMAN AILMENTS. THAT ARE PRESENTLY BEING LOOKED AT IN ADDITION TO REMOVING ANTIBIOTICS FROM AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS LIKE SWINE IN COW THAT WOULD TRADITIONALLY REQUIRE ANTIBIOTICS. THEY NO LONGER DO BECAUSE THE ALLIGATOR PRODUCTS ARE IN THEIR MEAT -- THAT THAT CONSUME THANK YOU OKAY THANKS SO I AM INTERESTED TIME INSTRUMENTS AND I RECOGNIZE. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY BILL THAT WE HAVE LEFT I KNOW THEY ARE PASSIONATE FEELINGS ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL GOOD DISCUSSION I AGREE WHAT SO I I GUESS RIGHT WHAT I WOULD NEED TO SEE IS FOR HER -- PROTECTIONS I MEAN IS SAID MINIMALLY THAT THE LEGEND THAT LANGUAGE IS PLACE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AS MISS VERY POINTED OUT I HAVE STRONGLY SUPPORTED MS FRIEDMAN'S BILL FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO AND FOR CONSISTENCY SAKE. I STRUGGLE WITH SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING THAT BILL -- THERE MAY BE CUTENESS FACTOR THAT'S INVOLVED BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT RIGHT -- AND MY INTEREST THOUGH ISN'T LIFESAVING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE'RE HERE TO SERVE THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS OF STATE CALIFORNIA -- AND IF THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS MEDICAL RESEARCH THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO ME I REPRESENT A LOT OF COMPANIES -- IN SAN DIEGO -- WHO I PRESUMABLY WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS ACCESS BUT THAT'S A FAR DIFFERENT -- CONVERSATION THEN MEET -- THEN -- SKIN -- THAN SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS SO -- I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I WILL TO SUSPEND DISBELIEF A BIT LONGER TO TO SEE IF WE CAN MAKE IT CONVERSATION ABOUT LIFESAVING TREATMENTS I'M NOT AS INTERESTED. IN ME AND I AND IN SHOES AND WALLETS AND PURSES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE OF THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I'M AT IF THAT MAKES BETWEEN -- WHICH I HATE THAT TERM -- NORMALLY A PRETTY DECISIVE IN NATURE BUT I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES OF THIS AND I'M NOT SURE HOW WE CAN PROCEED IF AT ALL TODAY -- BUT THAT'S MY TWO CENTS CHAIR. IN IT IT DOES SOUND LIKE YOU KNOW THERE'S A MEMBER BEFORE SIDE I BELIEVE MR LAYING WHO IS UP HERE EARLIER. HAD MADE THAT POINT AS WELL THAT HE WANTS TO WORK ON LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HELP BETTER PROTECT. AGAINST THREATENED SPECIES OBVIOUSLY BEING USED AND THEN OBVIOUSLY HIS INTEREST. IS IN THE MEDICAL AS WELL WELL IN THAT AS A QUESTION ARE THE ENDANGERED. SPECIES THE ONES THAT PEOPLE NEED. TO TO TEST UPON BECAUSE IF. IT. NO AND I GUESS IN A IN THE ANALYSIS UNDERSIDE THESE ALL WELL THIS IS ALL HIDE SOLD COMMERCIALLY REQUIRED TO BE TAG TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM LISTED SPECIES THAT ARE NOT PERMITTED AND I GET. AND THAT'S ALSO SAID I STRUGGLE WITH IS THAT COMMITTEE NOW SAYS WELL GOOD I'M DOESN'T AS WE SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE IN INTO MEDICAL -- AND YOU KNOW AGAIN ABOUT GOING OFF FOR THE TESTIMONY WHICH ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES ARE MAKING THE SAME CASE. RED FOR MAKING OFF THE CASES ARE. OKAY -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. JUST THAT YES VISIBLE ON A FOLLOW UP AND THIS IS TO BOTH THE AUTHORS AND I AND I AND I DO HOPE THIS BILL ACTUALLY GETS OUT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS. ADDED VALUE HERE WHILE THERE IS SOME CONCERNS THAT ARE CLEARLY. SEEN HERE AND PRESENTED. IS THERE IS A SERIOUS COMMITMENT FROM BOTH THE AUTHORS. AND LOOKING AT TAKING AMENDMENTS AS IT GOES. FROM HERE I THINK IT GOES TO THE FLOOR THEY'LL BE IN THE SENATE. WILL IT BE FOCUSED ON IN THE SENATE WHERE YOU CAN TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED. BUT YEAH ABSOLUTELY OUR GUEST. THANK EVEN THOUGH THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR ASSEMBLY FLOOR. MAYBE EVEN READ YES ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. OKAY IT WILL BRING IT BACK YOU KNOW. THE DID YOU HAVE DID YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT MISTER GLORIA WELL I GUESS I'D BE INTERESTED IN INTEREST ANYWAY WHAT YOU THINK YOU COULD SUPPORTER YOUR SPONSORS COULD SUPPORT. IN TERMS OF NARROWING. THE NATURE OF THE BILL. MIKE THANK YOU WERE OPEN TO EVERYTHING LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT -- WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS THAT. THIS IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAD BEEN CREATED. THAT HAS BROUGHT THE SPECIES BACK FROM THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION IN MANY AREAS -- IT IS. A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AND IT IS -- IT IS RESULTED ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AS WELL AND SO. AS LONG AS WE CAN RECOGNIZE THAT AND THEN RECOGNIZE THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS. THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BECAUSE OF THIS PARTNERSHIP I THINK WE CAN WE CAN GET TO YES -- I'M I DISAGREE WITH. MY GOOD COLLEAGUE -- FROM THE SANTA CLARA REGION BUT BUT IF YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT THEN IT'S HARD TO GET TSN WHATEVER ADVISEMENT NEED TO ACCOMPANY THE PRODUCT -- WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE. THAT. BE PART OF IT SO THAT -- SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE COMPLYING WITH WITH SITE IS AND THAT YEAR THAT'D BE IS ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES THAT IT THAT HAVE BEEN -- A PART OF OF THE OF THE DEVELOPMENT. AT THE OF THE PRODUCT AND SO. I GUESS WHAT I A RESEARCHER SANE -- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A RECOGNITION OF THE OF THE RESURGENCE OF THIS SPECIES GIVEN SOME OF THIS TO THE SENATE SHOULD SHOULD BE ABLE. TO TO THIS BUT YOU KNOW COULD COULD YOU LIMITED TO THE NON -- IN DANGER NON VULNERABLE SPECIES IS THAT EVEN TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE COULD WE PROHIBIT THE IMPORTATION FOR COSMETIC AND AND FASHION USES WHICH ARE. KIND OF BACKWARDS IN MY OPINION -- LIMITED TO HIM AND INVESTMENT FOR LIFESAVING THERAPIES I MEAN THESE THE THAT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS I THINK. AT LEAST SPEAK TO ME I WANT TO BE FOR THE WHOLE COMMITTEE BUT I I THINK THAT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN IMPORTED SUBMITS ITS ENDANGERED SO SOMEONE CAN HAVE A NEW BAG THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I CAN SUPPORT. RIGHT WELL THE ENDANGERED. UP PART OF IT IT THERE'S NO QUESTION AT ALL I DON'T THINK IT I MEAN THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NARROWING IT ONLY TO MEDICAL RESEARCH WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT BACK TO THE SPONSORS AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM. AND I THINK THAT IS INTENT OF THEIR AMENDMENT IS TO STATE IN THERE AND HAD AND I KNOW. FOR ME -- PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE EVEN STRONGER LANGUAGE BUT THE INTENT IS TO ENSURE THAT. NOTHING COULD BE IMPORTED THAT WOULD BE A THREATENED SPECIES BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE IMPERMISSIBLE UNDER SIDE EAST OF THE TREATY. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THIS HEARING DID YOU HEAR WELL I JUST MENTION NIGHT. AMERICAN ALLIGATORS ARE LISTED UNDER THE FEDERAL ESA AS A LOOKALIKE SPECIES OUT OF THE THINGS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT SO. WHAT IS ANY LOOKALIKES THERE IF YOU? MEANING THEY LOOK ALIKE ENOUGH LIKE THAT THE LISTED SPECIES THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED FROM THERE THEY ARE LISTED AS THREATENED BECAUSE THEY ARE TRADE WOULD IMPACT ADVERSELY SPECIES THAT THEY LOOK ALIKE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE THE DIFFERENCE CANNOT BE TOLD. SO EVEN IF YOU HAD A DOWN THIS ROAD IF THEY'RE RAISING A FARM DIVERSION OF A SPECIES THAT'S LISTED UNDER THE ESSAY THAT WOULD NOT BEEN WE DID WHAT YOU SUGGESTED. THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE SALE OF THE SPECIES THEIR RATING REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE. SO EVEN IT'S NOT ENDANGERED IT HAPPENS TO LOOK LIKE IT'S IN DANGER SO THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF OUR FACILITY BECAUSE IT IS. IT'S CONSIDERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CREATE THAT ITS TRADE CREATES ENOUGH OF A PROBLEM FOR SPECIES THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IT. TOO IS LISTED. I THINK I UNDERSTAND. SINCE AND I AM SO BASICALLY UNDER THE LAW RIGHT NOW UNDER THE TREATY AND THAT THIS IS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS ELSEWHERE IT IS ILLEGAL. TO IMPORT THREATENED SPECIES. INTO THE UNITED STATES WE ALSO HAVE. THE US FISH AND WILDLIFE ACTUALLY DOES DNA TESTING. TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT A THREATENED SPECIES WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES IN -- SO THERE. SO THAT IS A LEGAL I THINK WHAT MISS FEARING A SANE THERE STILL ISN'T A LEGAL TRADE THAT GOES ON AND YOU KNOW JUST LIKE WITH A LOT OF A LOT WE PASS LAWS BANNING THINGS ARE SCORES SAYING THIS IS PROHIBITED. BUT THEY'RE STILL PEOPLE OUT THERE THERE ARE BAD ACTORS WHO ARE BASICALLY BREAKING THE LAW ANYWAY RIGHT. AS BUT UNDER THE LAW AND UNDER THE TREATY IT IS ILLEGAL TO USE. TO IMPORT A THREATENED SPECIES. IT FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE. YEAH WE CAN GO TO THE EXPERT IF YOU LIKED IT BUT I WILL WE NEED TO GET MOVING ALONG HERE SO I THINK WE'VE KIND OF DEFINITELY COVER A LOT ISSUE GROUND HERE. OKAY MAYBE TAKE THAT AS YOU GUYS IS CLOSE. OKAY OKAY -- ALL RIGHT SO BRING I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR SO I'M FILLING IN FOR THE CHAIR TODAY -- THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS NONE ON THIS BILL -- I PERSONALLY AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY -- IN MY BASIS FOR DOING SO IS NUMBER ONE WE WE DO HAVE A HISTORY HERE OF PREVIOUS LEGISLATURE'S. EXTENDING THE SUNSET YES OF FOR AT LEAST THREE TIMES NOW WE'VE DECIDED. BASED ON THE RECOVERY OF THE SPECIES IN THE THINGS THAT WERE SEEN IN. IN FLORIDA AND IN LOUISIANA AND AUSTRALIA -- THAT THIS ACTUALLY HAS BEEN HELPFUL -- TO THE RECOVERY OF THE SPECIES. AND REALLY ALL WE'RE DOING HERE IS EXTEND IN THAT SENSE THAT AGAIN -- SO ME I I THINK. HE'LL WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN SOME GOOD RESULTS THERE I THINK THERE'S THINGS THAT WE COULD. CONTINUE TO TRY AND BUILD UPON TO ENSURE PROTECTIONS. AS THE MEMBER GLORIA IS POINT OUT AND OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE AUTHORS. WHO ARE VERY MUCH WILLING TO WORK ON AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS GOING FORWARD -- AND SO I WOULD ENTERTAIN YOU KNOW A IS IT MOVED AS AMENDED OR JUST SAYS IT. OKAY MOVED AS AMENDED AS AS PROPOSED BY THE AUTHORS AND THEIR YEAH GO HEAD AND READ THE AMENDMENT AGAIN. THE MOMENT STATES STARTING ON PAGE FOUR LINE. TWELVE WOULD BE.

WITH THIS PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED AN ENDANGERED SPECIES SOCIETIES SECOND. BED BUT THAT'S THE I GUESS WE'LL GO THERE PROPOSED AMENDMENT.

YES. AND I'M NOT [inaudible] HELLO. THIS IS BETTER YEAH GO AHEAD OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR AB TWELVE FIFTY FOUR PUTS A TEMPORARY PROHIBITION ON TROPHY HUNTING OF BOBCATS WHILE ALLOWING THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TIME TO REVIEW CRITICAL FACTORS. INCLUDING THE AFFECT OF TROPHY HUNTING ON BOTH BOBCAT POPULATIONS AND THEIR PREY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF A HUNT TO THE AGENCY. AND AN ANALYSIS OF NON LETHAL MEASURES BEFORE RE OPENING A TROPHY HUNTING SEASON ON BOBCATS. AB TWELVE FIFTY FOUR ALSO CONTAINS COMMONSENSE EXEMPTIONS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE BOB THE TAKE A BOBCATS IN THE EVENT THAT ONE WAS THREATENING PUBLIC SAFETY LIVESTOCK OR PETS. CALIFORNIANS CONSISTENTLY HAVE SUPPORTED PROTECTIONS AGAINST TROPHY HUNTING FOR OUR STATE'S NATIVE CARNIVORES. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO THEN GOVERNOR REAGAN INITIATED A MORATORIUM ON THE TROPHY HUNTING OF MOUNTAIN LIONS FOLLOWED BY A BALLOT MEASURE PROHIBITING PRO HITTING HUNTING OF MOUNTAIN LIONS. IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS WHITTLED AWAY AT THE METHODS USED TO KILL CALIFORNIA SMALLER NATIVE WILD CAT. IN TWENTY TWELVE THE LEGISLATURE BANNED THE USE OF POUNDS IN THE HUNTING OF BOBCATS AND RESTRICTED TRAPPING WHICH WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY A STATEWIDE BAN ON TRAPPING BY THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. IF PASSED THIS BILL WILL REPRESENT THE NEXT CRITICAL STEP TO FINALLY PUT AN END TO THE NEEDLESS SLAUGHTER OF THESE ELUSIVE CATS. AND ALLOW FOR THE GATHERING OF MUCH NEEDED SCIENTIFIC DATA. AB TWELVE FIFTY FOUR SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE BY SETTING IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE DEVELOP ACOMPREHENSIVE BOBCAT MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS WILL INCLUDE AN UPDATED STATEWIDE POPULATION ESTIMATES. THE LAST BOBCAT POPULATION ASSESSMENT IN CALIFORNIA IS MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD AND IS DATED AND LIKELY INACCURATE. BECAUSE THE ASSESSMENT SO DATED IT FAILS TO REFLECT THE CURRENT SCIENTIFIC METHODS FOR ASSESSING AND MONITORING THE OVERALL HEALTH IN TREND OF THE STATEWIDE POPULATION. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL REQUIRE THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TO CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF TROPHY HUNTING BOBCATS. INCLUDING AFFECTS ON THEIR PREY DISEASE ABATEMENT AND CONTROL OF INVASIVE SPECIES SUCH AS THE NUTRIA RATS PRIOR TO RE OPENING A BOBCAT HUNTING SEASON. LACKING NO RELIABLE A RECENT ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT STATEWIDE POPULATION IT'S COMMON SENSE TO PUT AN END TO THIS KILLING UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE COMPLETES EXTENSIVE ANALYSES. SHOWING YHO BEHIND OF BOBCATS NEEDS TO CONTINUE. TROPHY HUNTING. PRO TROPHY HUNTING ENTHUSIASTS CANNOT ARGUE THAT DECISIONS NEED SCIENCE BUT THEN ARGUE AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT WOULD MANDATE THE GATHERING OF THAT EXACT SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY BOBCAT TAX COST A MERE THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FOUR CENTS BARELY MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. LESS THAN FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY THAT IS LESS THAN THE SALARY OF A SINGLE GAME WARDEN. I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON AB TWELVE FIFTY FOUR AND HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS WENDY KEEP OVER FROM THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU SO A MEMBER AND ARE YOU DID YOU SAY ARE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS YES OKAY. THERE AND AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO MINUTES EACH SO LET'S TRY AND STAY ON TRACK. I'M I'M WENDY KEEP OVER I'M THAT. NATIVE CARNIVORE PROTECTION MANAGER FOR THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THEN AND UNITED STATES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEES -- THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES AND OUR CALIFORNIA SUPPORTERS I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT OF TWELVE FIFTY FOUR CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC BOBCATS HAVE BEEN AFFORDED SOME PROTECTIONS IN RECENT YEARS. YET HUNTER STILL CUT A KILL HUNDREDS OF THEM ANNUALLY FOR NOTHING MORE THAN A TROPHY OR FOR THEIR FUR PELTS. AND THOSE FOR PELZER OFTEN SHIPPED OVERSEAS MARKETS IT'S TIME IN CALIFORNIA TO CLOSE THE LOOP AND PUT A MORATORIUM ON TROPHY HUNTING CALIFORNIA'S SMALLEST WILD CATS WHO ARE HIGHLY SENTIENT AND HOLD INTRINSIC VALUES. BOBCATS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN BALANCING THE HEALTH OF THEIR INCOME SYSTEMS THEY PREY UPON RODENTS RABBITS INVASIVE NUTRIA WHICH IN TURN BENEFIT FARMERS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SO I JUST LOOK THIS UP NUTRIA CAN PRODUCE THREE LITTERS A YEAR IN UP TO TWELVE KIDS PER LITTER -- NUTRIA HARM CROPS WETLANDS ECOSYSTEMS AND EVEN HUMAN HEALTH ON THE OTHER HAND BOBCATS ARE VERY SLOW TO REPRODUCE -- THEY'RE VERY AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLY RARE IT'S EXCITING TO SPOT WHEN IN THE WILD AND 74% OF CALIFORNIANS WOULD VALUE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A WILD BOBCAT WE JUST DID A POLL -- EARLIER LIKE LAST WEEK. AND THAT'S WHAT WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT 74%. 74% CALIFORNIA'S WANNA SEE OR A BOBCAT IN THE WILD. SO BOB CAT NUMBERS ARE KEPT IN CHECK BY A NUMBER OF OF FORCES. THEY THEY ARE PREYED UPON. BY OTHER CARNIVORES THEY FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER CARNIVORES SUCH AS COYOTES AND MOUNTAIN LIONS AND ALSO THE NUMBER OF PREY REGULATES THE NUMBERS OF PREDATORS -- JUST LIKE WITH ANY CO SYSTEM SO YOU MEMBER THE CLASSIC A SNOWSHOE HARE AND THE LINKS -- MODEL SO BOBCATS ALSO FACED ADDITIONAL THREATS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING LOSS OF HABITAT FROM URBAN SPRAWL AND OF COURSE THE RECENT DEADLY FIRES AND FOR THESE REASONS BOB CATS DON'T NEED TO BE TROPHY HUNTING. HUNTED PART ME. TROPHY HUNTING SIMPLY PUTS UNNECESSARY ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THEIR POPULATIONS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN OVER THREE DECADES. AND AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN MENTIONED THIS LEGISLATION SUPPORTS THE USE OF SOUND SCIENCE BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE MUCH A BOBCAT MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS ASSESSES THEIR POPULATION USING THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. AND REPLACES THE OUTDATED THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD ASSESSMENT. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF A LOOK AT THE HOLISTIC AFFECTS OF TROPHY HUNTING BOBCATS NOT JUST ON THEIR OWN POPULATIONS BUT ALSO ON PREY AND INVASIVE SPECIES CAN. CONTROL. UP PRIOR TO OPENING A SEASON HE COULDN'T WRAP UP A LITTLE OKAY SIR SO -- JUST THREE MINUTES. I'M AT THREE MINUTES YEAH. OKAY -- CALIFORNIANS WITH WEED AS I SAID WE DID A POLL -- CALIFORNIANS BY ABOUT 4%. WHAT A 70% DE UM DON'T SUPPORT TROPHY HUNTING SO? I CAN WRAP IT UP THERE AND I CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS IF YOU LINE DID YOU HAVE. NINE STAFF OKAY ALL RIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING INTO ANOTHER WITNESS OKAY. ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

GO AHEAD MR HERE MEMBERS -- AND STAFF MANY PARENTS ARE FROM SINGLE HAVE THE REMARKABLE UP TO THE THANK YOU. YEAH GOOD MORNING TO YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS ERIC SKLAR FROM SANTA ANA CALIFORNIA ALSO PRESENT AT THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. DEEPLY HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY I WANT TO SHOUT OUT YOUR STAFF WHO WE WORK WITH CLOSELY AT THE COMMISSION AND ARE TERRIFIC ON THE WORK WE ALL DO TO PROTECT. CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL WILDLIFE COUPLE QUICK COPY OUT TO BE VERY BRIEF MY SUBSTANCE COMMENTS ONE IS I'M NOT HERE REPRESENTING THE COMMISSION OCCASIONALLY MEET EVERY OTHER MONTH. AND SO WITH THIS BILL DROPPED AFTER OUR LAST MEETING WILL BE DISCUSSING IT ARE BEATING UP A WEEK FROM. TOMORROW IN THE END UP SANTA MONICA -- ADDITIONALLY -- I'M NOT STRICTLY HERE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSE TO DISPEL I DEEPLY SHARE THAT THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO THIS SPECIES INTO WILDLIFE PROTECTION AS YOU'D EXPECT. ON THE COMMISSION IS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO THAT AS WELL I APPLAUD MOST OF WHAT'S IN THIS IN THIS BILL -- I'M HERE JUST AS AN INSTITUTIONALIZED AND TO TALK% ABOUT PROCESS I'M AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED. THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED US INTO IN TWENTY TWELVE TO STUDY THE COMMERCIAL TRAPPING ABOUT CATS AND WE DID THAT THOROUGHLY AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THE COMMISSION VOTED TO BAN COMMERCIAL BOBCAT TRAPPING IN CALIFORNIA IS NOW FORBIDDEN. IN THE WHOLE STATE -- WITH AT THE CO AUTHORS ALSO RIGHT THAT A GOOD STUDY HAS NOT BEEN DONE FOR A WHILE IN THESE KIND OF THINGS NEED TO BE BASED ON SCIENCE. I APPLAUD THE IDEA OF ASKINGTHE COMMISSION TO EVALUATE THE RECREATIONAL HUNTING A BOBCATS COM THERE'S NO INDICATION IF THERE'S ANY THREAT TO THE SPECIES THEIR CHARISMATIC IMPORTANT SPECIES. REPORTING PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND WE NEED TO STUDY THEM FULLY I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO IN YOUR COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THE FUNDING FOR SUCH A STUDY IT'S AN EXPENSIVE STUDY THEIR ELUSIVE. THEY'RE SPREAD OUT ALMOST ALL OVER THE STATE I'M IN SO WE NEED THE RESOURCES TO STUDY THEM THAT'S ALL I WOULD ASK IS WE DON'T SET A PRECEDENT ESTABLISHED MORATORIUM. BASED ON THE IN A PREVIOUS TO STUDIES ONE OF THREE SPECIES ISN'T THREATENED OR ENDANGERED WE DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN THERE'S A PETITION FOR SPECIES IT'S ACCEPTED. IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT NECESSARY I THINK MORE TORIA -- SHOULD BE USED VERY SPARINGLY WE YOU HAVE MY OBLIGATION AND DEDICATION TO STUDY THIS. ISSUE CLOSELY AND TO BRING IT BEFORE THE COMMISSION. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE YOU'RE SPEAKER JUST GIVE THEIR NAME AND AT THE END AND WHERE THEY'RE FROM WE GOT HEARD ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY SPEAKERS AT THREE MINUTES EACH ON THIS TOPIC LAST TIME EXPECT WILL. HEAR THE SAME AGAINST I'M NOT ASKING FOR THIS BECAUSE WE WANT EXTRA WORK WE HAVE A TINY STAFF. AND IT'S A LOT OF WORK BUT WE IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT AND ARE. I WANT TO TAKE ON AND SO WE JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THIS WITHOUT THE MORATORIUM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER NEXT. LEVEL CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKET ONLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION WHEN THE FIRST SAY RESPECTFULLY I'D HARDLY CALL A FIFTEEN TO TWENTY POUNDS BOB CAT AS A TROPHY ANIMAL. BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION. REGARDING AB TWELVE TWELVE FIFTY FOUR IT WE SEE THIS IS A VERY ANTI HUNTING MEASURE THAT IS NOT BASED ON SCIENCE OR SOUND SCIENCE -- WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT BOB CATS ARE ABUNDANT AND FOUND THROUGHOUT MOST OF CALIFORNIA. AS YOU ALSO MAY KNOW THEIR FOUND THROUGHOUT MOST THE LOWER FORTY EIGHT ALL THE WAY UP INTO CANADA DOWN IN MEXICO. HONEY IN -- IS HIGHLY REGULATED AND HAS VERY LITTLE IF ANY IMPACT ON THE SPECIES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN THE BOBCAT HUNTING TAGS THERE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND OF THOSE SOLD AND ONLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE ANIMALS WERE TAKEN SO. CLEARLY HUNTING IS SUSTAINABLE FOR THE SPECIES. BOB CATS AS YOU ALL KNOW AS WELL PREY ON A VARIETY OF WILDLIFE INCLUDING GAME BIRDS SMALL MAMMALS EVEN DEAR. AND WILDLIFE MANAGERS IN OUR VIEW IN NEED THE FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE THEM WHEN NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN -- GOOD PREDATOR PREY POPULATIONS. IT'S PARTICULARLY AND THE FRAGMENTED HABITATS THAT WE HAVE LEFT WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME ECOSYSTEM THAT WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE WHEN CALIFORNIA BECAME A STATE. LEGAL HUNTING -- IS ONE OF THOSE MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND ALSO IMPORTANTLY PROVIDES FUNDING FOR CONSERVATION THROUGH HUNTING LICENSE STAMPS TAGS PITTMAN ROBERTSON ACT REVENUES. AND A LOT OF THAT MONEY Q. IS USED FOR ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES SO THAT SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND. LAW ABIDING HUNTERS THERE IN THE FIELD THOSE THAT BY THE LICENSES THEY ARE THE EYES AND THE EARS OF THE WARDENS OUT IN THE WOODS. IF YOU TAKE THE LEGAL HUNTERS OUT OF THE FIELD. YOU'RE GOING TO JUST REDUCE -- THE ABILITY TO SEE POACHING TO REPORT ON IT TO USE CAL TIP WE'VE GOT MARIJUANA CULTIVATION GOING ON POACHING OF OTHER SPECIES WE WANT THESE LEGAL HUNTERS IN THE FIELD TO CONTINUE TO A THE WARDENS -- AS WAS TOUCHED ON EARLIER I MEAN IN OUR VIEW THIS BILL REALLY CIRCUMVENTS THE SEA QUEST SCIENCE BASED PROCESS OF THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. ON WHICH WAS SPECIFICALLY ESTABLISHED REGULATE ON IN SO -- THAT SOMETHING -- THAT IS OF HUGE CONCERN TO US FINALLY I WOULD SAY. THE FIVE YEAR PROHIBITION THAT'S BEEN -- MENTIONED IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO US THAT REALLY MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE AGAIN FROM A SCIENTIFIC VIEWPOINT. HONEY IN IS NOT A PROBLEM THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE A BAN ON IT. AND REALLY ALL YOU'RE DOING THEN IS REMOVING -- DATA THAT COULD BE HELPFUL THE POPULATION WHEN WE GO OUT TIME HARBORS OF THESE ANIMALS WE KNOW HOW MANY ARE TAKEN AND THAT HELPS TO SUSTAIN ONLY SUSTAINABLY MANAGED SPC OVER THE LONG TERM SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU MISTER HENLEY. OKAY -- OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MY NAME IS JIM WATER SENATE REPRESENT TO THE CUP COUNTRY AT THE CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT AND CAUCUS. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK FOUNDATION AND CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR NORTH AMERICA WHILE SHE I'D LIKE TO CONCUR WITH MY PREDECESSORS ON BOTH A COMMENT OPPOSITION ADD. THAT. SEEKS WHAT YOUR OPPOSITION IS VERY QUICK DOCUMENT IS PART OF THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. MANDATE THAT IS NOT MENTIONED BEFORE THANKS OR HE MADE THAT POINT ALL RIGHT YET. OTHER AT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I HAVE FOR COMMENTS QUESTIONS. BUT YET MR BIGELOW. DOES MOVED IT AND THAT IS DO PASS AS AMENDED I BELIEVE THE SENATE MEMBER TOOK THE AMENDMENTS AND SECONDED BY MISS REAVIS. YES MISTER BIGELOW. MISSTEP MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE AN ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS ARE POINTS THAT WERE MADE HERE BOTH BY. HE'S OF THE OPPOSITION. SEEM REASONABLE MAYBE YOU COULD ANSWER. WHY ARE YOU? TAKING AN ACTION TO OUT RIGHT DO A MORATORIUM WHEN THERE IS -- STUDIES THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO MAY BE JUSTIFIED DOING A MORATORIUM. SO I WILL LET. ALL THIS ADDED THAT REALLY QUICKLY BECAUSE I I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT I HAVE BEEN HERE THE SO IT WAS MENTIONED EARLY THREE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE BOBCATS WERE TAKEN. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEAR. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEAR -- THE REPRODUCTIVE RATES FAR EXCEED THE RATE OF HARVEST. THE PREVIOUS THERE HAS BEEN NO STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT THEY ARE THREATENED AT THIS TIME AND I THINK THAT WAS THE BIG POINT THE COMMISSIONER BROUGHT UP IS. ABSENT SOME CLEAR SCIENCE IT'S HARD TO DO A A BAND AND YOU BROUGHT REALLY SHOULDN'T PROCEED WITH THE MORATORIUM. UNTIL WE HAVE THAT SO WHY NOT DO THE STUDY. FIRST SO THAT WE KNOW REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEN WE COULD PROCEED TO A BAD WHAT RATHER THAN DOING THE BAND AND THE STUDY. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND I THINK WE'RE ALL HERE IN AGREEMENT THAT THE SCIENCES AND ON EITHER SIDE. AND UNTIL IT IS WE SHOULD STOP THE HUNTING BE ABLE TO GET THE DATA I THINK IT'S VERY HARD FOR THE PRO HUNTING IS YES. TO MAKE THEIR ARGUMENTS AGAINST A LEGISLATION THAT WOULD MANDATE THE GATHERING TO EXTRACT THE SCIENTIFIC DATA. OKAY YES MISTER. SO CAN I CAN HELP YOU CAN I DO NEED EVERITT YET ALL RESPOND TO THAT AS WELL -- I JUST ONE AGAIN IT'S IT'S ALSO BASED ON HUMAN VALUES AND WE'VE DONE IT WE'VE DONE A SURVEY IN CALIFORNIA AND ABOUT 70% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE OPPOSED TO TROPHY HUNTING. AND WE DEFINE TROPHY HUNTING AS WHERE A PERSON'S PRIMARY MOTIVATION IS TO KILL AN ANIMAL IN ORDER TO DISPLAY BODY PARTS OR TO STUFF THE ANIMAL THEY TAKE A SELFIE WITH THE ANIMAL IT'S NOT NO ONE EATS BOBCAT. OR THEIR OR THEY'RE SELLING THE FIRS ABROAD. SO. ESSENTIALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN END OF TROPHY HUNTING A BOBCATS. AND THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL THAT STILL ALLOW FOR THE KILLING OF BOBCATS I THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE LISTED SO IT'S NOT. AND I WANT TO SAY IT'S NOT AN OUTRIGHT MORATORIUM BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THE KILLING OF BOBCATS. WOULD BE ALLOWABLE -- IF THERE'S BODILY HARM IF THEY'RE ATTACKING -- LIVESTOCK OR PETS IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IF YOU HAVE A PERMIT SO IT'S IT'S NOT AN OUTRIGHT MORATORIUM AND IN FACT -- AS WAS MENTIONED WE HAVE TAKEN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND OUR HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE COMMISSION -- THEY YOU KNOW AFTER MOMENTS COME INTO PRINT SO THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS YOU KNOW FURTHER ALONG. BUT IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO KIND OF STUDY THE ACTIONS TO TAKE A PAUSE AND STUDY BOTH THE AFFECTS OF THE BIO DIVERSITY -- IN OUR ECOSYSTEM YOU KNOW WITH THE BOBCATS WITH THEM REDUCING AND NUMBER -- AND ALLOW THE DATA TO SHARE WITH THIS. TO HELP THE STATE UNDERSTAND -- AND DECIDE HOW IT WANTS TO CONTINUE TO ACT AS IT RELATES TO THE BOBCAT. SOUL. YES GO AHEAD AS WE MAKE A QUICK CORRECTION -- HUNTERS CANNOT SELL THE BOBCATS OUT OF STATE THERE'S A BAN ON COMMERCIAL TRAP YOU CAN'T SELL THESE BELTS THAT ALSO PEOPLE USE THEM. AND THEIR HOME AND AND WE WILL IN THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD ABOUT IT DURING A VERY LONG MULTI YEAR PROCESS ON THE BAY COMMERCIAL BOBCAT TRAPPING. IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T EAT BOBCAT THAT -- THE MOSTTHAT ARE USED FOR PELTS BY THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MINUTES AND IT'S A YOU KNOW IT'S WORLD FOLKS IN IN YOU KNOW IN VERY SMALL NUMBERS. WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS NOW WE GOTTA GET IT THAT THAT'S CRITICAL ON THE LAST THAT EACH OTHER SOMETHING AROUND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND I BELIEVE CLOSE THAT SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND A LONG TIME AGO. BUT THERE'S NO INDICATION IT'S GOING DOWN AND WE WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME A PETITION IF THEY'RE SCIENCE THAT SAYS. THAT WE NEED TO LIST THE SPECIES RIGHT AWAY WE WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND THAT'S WERE MORE TORY COMMITTED PLACE BRENT SO ODD. TRYING TO GET TO THE CONCERN HERE WHICH IS. WHY NOT GO THROUGH A BUDGET PROCESS AND WORK WITH THE COMMISSION? WHY WASN'T THERE THOUGHT MAYBE TO THE SPONSORS? TO ACTUALLY ASK FOR A REQUEST FOR FUNDING. SO THAT THE COMMISSION COULD THEN DO THE LONG TERM STUDY OR SHORT TERM STUDY HOWEVER IT COMES ABOUT. SO THAT WE COULD IDENTIFY. IS THERE A NEED IS ARE WE ARE A PURPOSE OR PLACE FOR A MORATORIUM FOR THIS SPECIES COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT WELL AGAIN -- MOST PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT WANT TO HAVE A TROPHY HUNT ON BOBCATS AND WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO WOULD GET FUNDING TO THE AGENCY SO THEY CAN STUDY THEM. AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE RIGHT NOW IS IS YOU'VE GOT TO USE REMOTE CAMERA TECHNOLOGY -- ESPECIALLY WITH BOBCATS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A UNIQUE PATTERN IT'S IT'S EASY IT'S EASY TO USE THOSE KIND OF REMOTE CAMERAS SO. YOU KNOW. COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS THEY COULD PROBABLY YOU DO A PRETTY GOOD SIZE STUDY IN CALIFORNIA. ON BOBCT SO LET'S LET'S GET THE FUNDING LET'S DO IT LET'S LET'S PUT A MORATORIUM LET'S STUDY. BOBCATS LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHEN YOU PUT THOSE CAMERAS OUT THERE NOT ONLY ARE YOU SEEING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH BOBCATS BUT YOU CAN STUDY OTHER ANIMALS TOO SO IT'S A IT'S A WIN WIN SITUATION. I I AGREE THAT THERE CAN BE A WIN WIN SITUATION. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT. AS WE LOOK AT BOB CATS THEY ARE PREDATORS AND INTO THEMSELVES AND AS A GROWING SPECIES THEY'RE HAVING AN IMPACT. ON THE WILD BIRDS. WE'RE SEEING A DECIMATION OF A QUAIL AND DUCK POPULATIONS ON THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE'RE SEEING OTHER SPECIES WHILE THE GRADS. GOING AWAY BECAUSE OF THE PREDATORS THAT ARE TAKING DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S AN OVERPOPULATION THERE'S A HUGE GROWTH IN THESE ARENAS FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE USING INFORMATION. OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHICH YOU SAID SEVENTY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND IS WHAT THE BASS NUMBER WAS ON THAT. AT THAT TIME IN THE SEVENTIES IN FACT IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT NUMBER JUST USING SEVENTY THOUSAND AND WE JUST ASSUME THAT HALF OF THEM WERE FEMALES AND OF BEARING. AGE -- THAT WOULD MEAN. THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND FEMALES COULD HAVE A POTENTIAL OF SIX LITTERS. IT'S A POTENTIAL THAT'S WHAT'S IN RESOURCE RESEARCHED DATA YOU CAN SAVE MORE OR I'M SAY LESS. BUT SIX IS THE NUMBER AND THEY HAVE AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT KITTENS SO IF WE LOOK AT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND LETTERS OUT OF THAT. THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND AND WE MULTIPLY THE EIGHT TIMES. ON THOSE LETTERS THAT'S ONE POINT SIX MILLION. KEEP OUR BABY KITTENS THAT ARE GONNA GROW. MAN FROM NINETEEN YES MA'AM NINETEENTH THAT. YOU MAY WHEN I'M DONE OKAY A SO WHEN. OUR KITTENS GROW TO MATURITY THEY WILL BE ABLE WHICH IT TAKES A FULL YEAR BEFORE THEY CAN BREED. AND THAT NUMBER GOES ON AND EXTRAPOLATE BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ONE POINT SIX MILLION. I'M GONNA BE FOR TRY TO BE VERY I'D SAY 90% OF THEM DON'T MAKE IT. SO WHEN A MINUTE SORRY. THAT'S ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND IF WE LOOK AT THE A NUMBER OF ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND AND REDUCE THAT FROM THE ONE SIX THAT'S A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND NEW KITTENS. THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE BEARING THEIR CONTINUED TO GROW. WERE IN THAT IN THAT ALMOST TEN MILLION RANGE. AS THIS STARTS TO GROW AND EACH AND EVERY OTHER YEAR THOSE ARE SPRINGS ARE ABLE TO START. HAVING LITTLE BABY KITTENS THAT ARE GOING TO GROW INTO FEMALES THEY'RE GONNA BEAR MORE KITTENS. SO THERE'S A A HUGE NUMBER OF BOBCATS THAT EXIST. OUT IN THE WORLD SO REALLY THIS COMES DOWN TO A DEBATE OF PHILOSOPHICAL -- POSITIONS. PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT THINGS TAKEN AND PEOPLE THAT ARE WANTING TO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO DO THAT. AND A THIRD COMPONENT. HUMAN INTERVENTION TO HELP KEEP THINGS IN CHECK. SO NOW HAVING SAID THAT. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR -- SO BOBCATS DO NOT REPRODUCE INFINITESIMALLY AS YOU'VE INDICATED A MOST BOBCAT KITTENS TO EVEN MAKE IT PAST THE FIRST YEAR AND THEY DON'T HAVE A KITTENS THEY HAVE ABOUT THREE ON AVERAGE. A FEMALE DOESN'T BECOME MATURE UNTIL SHE'S ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD AND THEN SHE'LL HAVE YOU KNOW ONE LETTER ABOUT EVERY YEAR MOST OF THOSE KITTENS WILL NOT SURVIVE. THE THE BOBCATS ALSO ARE PREYED UPON BY A DOMESTIC DOGS BY COYOTES BY MOUNTAIN LIONS -- AND THEY'RE IN COMPETITION WITH THOSE SAME CARNIVORES FOR RESOURCES SO. I MEAN BOBCATS ARE EXTREMELY RARE -- COMPARED TO THEIR PREY SPECIES SO -- YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE AN INFINITESIMAL NUMBER BOBCATS LOOK AT MOUNTAIN LION -- OUTLINE HUNTING STOPPED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND YOU GUYS WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION AROUND A MOUNTAIN LINES REGULATE THEIR OWN -- BECAUSE THE THE OLDER ADULT ANIMALS -- WILL KILL -- INCOMING IMMIGRATING YOUNGER ANIMALS AND SO THEY THEY REGULATE THEIR OWN SO WE DON'T NEED HUMAN INTERVENTION TO REGULATE BOBCAT POPULATIONS AND AND CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE. WITH OUTLINES IS SHOWN THAT'S THAT TO BE. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT I I WOULD SAY THAT WE BOTH HAVE DONE A RESEARCH ON ON THIS. AND THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND WILDLIFE. PRESENTS THAT INFORMATION AS TO THE REPRODUCTION AND THOSE NUMBERS. IN IN THEIR OWN -- ON OUR WEBSITE AND THERE ARE OTHER WEBSITES THAT PRODUCE THAT SAME INFORMATION THAT I CITED THAT'S WHY UTILIZED IT BECAUSE IT WOULD YOU CAN GO ON GO BILLION GO ON ANY SEARCH ENGINE. AND YOU CAN FIND THAT SAME INFORMATION AND I I GRANTED THE FACT OF MORTALITY WHEN I GAVE A RANGE. AND AS I GIVE THAT RANGE. THE NUMBERS ARE STILL. IN THE MILLIONS. AND IF YOU GET IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO GO OUT AND LOOK IN THE WILD. YOU GET TO SEE THE BOBCATS ON A REGULAR BASIS AT LEAST I'M ABLE TO GO OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND SEE HIM AND ENJOY HIM. I THINK THEY'RE CUTE THEY'RE FINE YOU GET TO WATCH A ROMP AND PLAY AND THAT'S ALL ALL GOOD THINGS BUT THE SAME TIME I KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN OVERPOPULATION -- WHICH I'M SEEING. THAT'S A PART OF THE ISSUE THAT'S GOING INTO OTHER AREAS WHICH THEY ARE TAKING DOWN OUR POPULATION OF WILD BIRDS. AND THAT'S A REAL ISSUE AND THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF A STUDY BEFORE WE GO INTO A FULL MORATORIUM TO SEE WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE. AND I AND WE WANT TO STUDY TO A DEGREE ANECDOTAL BUT IT IS OR NOT SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS IS IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COULD I WAS MORE OF A COMMENT THAN IT WAS EXHAUSTION -- SO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY I WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AROUND MEMBER FAMILY HOW JUST SAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OUT I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING. YOU KNOW MISTER BIGELOW IS CORRECT THIS IS A VALUE BASED CONVERSATION ABOUT PRESERVING OUR NATURAL ECOSYSTEM AND STUDYING BIO DIVERSITY WHILE PROTECTING A SPECIES I WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE HAVE TAKEN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER AND SO JUST TO BE CLEAR AGAIN THIS IS A DO PASS AS AMENDED RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR. I WILL BE OPPOSE IN THE BILL TODAY -- MYSELF -- AND FOR A LOT OF THE REASONS STATED BY MR BIGELOW I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A STUDY FIRST BEFORE WE DO. A MORATORIUM -- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE REASON FOR MY OPPOSITION DEFINITELY IMPORTANT ISSUE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING INTO BUT I THINK WE NEED. TO DO IT IN IN THE RIGHT WAY SO WITH THAT -- MEASURE WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS GALLAGHER NOEL GALLAGHER NO. BIGELOW. HELLO NO CHOI. CHOI NO CHIU. CHIU I DALLY [inaudible] FRIEDMAN. CRISTINA GARCIA GLORIA CHOLERA [inaudible] THREE OF US. THREE OF US SIGH ROBERT RIVAS. BLANCA RUBIO SALAS WOULD. WOULD I THREE THREE ON CALL YES THREE TO THREE EMILY THAT ARE CALLED WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF ABSENT MEMBERS RIGHT NOW THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I ALSO WANTED TO RECOGNIZE THREE OF US ASSEMBLYMEMBER REAVIS IS WITH US JOIN US SUBSTITUTING IN TODAY -- SO WELCOME TO THE WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE COMMITTEE. WE GET A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS ON THE DOCKET TODAY. OKAY SO NEXT UP WE HAVE MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. ITEM NUMBER. FOUR MR MAJOR IS VERY EFFICIENT SO I KNOW HE WILL GET THAT QUICKLY. AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU YOU. AND I WILL I GET MY BEST EFFICIENT PRESENTATION YEAH MISTER CHAIR I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS US. I WANT I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. AS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS THOUSANDS OF BIG EXOTIC ANIMALS ARE KILLED FOR THEIR SKINS EACH YEAR THESE ANIMALS -- SUPPER FOR THE SAKE OF FASHION -- IN VANITY EVEN WHEN ALTERNATIVES EXIST THERE ARE A BROAD ARRAY OF LUXURIOUS CRUELTY. FREE MATERIALS AVAILABLE FOR USE INCLUDING EMBOSSED IMITATION LEATHER THAT LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE EXOTIC SKIN WITHOUT THE CRUELTY. SEVERAL LARGE REALLY. TAYLOR'S HAVE ALREADY LED THE CHARGE IN BANNING THE SCANS INCLUDING CHANEL AND TAYLOR HMM ADIDAS AND VICTORIA'S SECRET TO NAME A FEW. AB TWELVES. AB TWELVE SIXTY WOULD BAN THE SALE OF IN THE IMPORTATION WITH INTENT TO SELL -- OF IGUANAS HIPPOS CAYMANS AND SEVERAL SPECIES OF LIZARDS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR HANNAH SHINE AND NEXT SACKETT. HI I'M HANNAH SHINE I'M SPEAKING TO YOU AGAIN ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE FOR THE ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS AND ARE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE SIXTY WHICH WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF SPECIES PROTECTED FROM THE CRUEL AN UNSUSTAINABLE EXOTIC SKINS INDUSTRY. REPTILE SUFFER IMMENSELY IN THE EXOTIC SKINS TRADE. HUNTERS SNARE WILD LIZARDS CUT THEM APART WITH MACHETES SEVER THEIR HEADS AND SKIN THEM. ONE OF OUR VIDEO EXPOSES WHICH YOU CAN SEE ON OUR WEBSITE PETER DOT ORG SHOWS A LIZARD WRITHING IN AGONY AS SHE SKINNED ALIVE. FOR WORK A SPECIALIST AND REPTILE BIOLOGY IN WELFARE STATES THAT BECAUSE REPTILES HAVE A SLOW METABOLISM THEY CAN REMAIN ALIVE FOR UP TO AN HOUR AFTER THEY'VE BEEN DECAPITATED AND SKINNED. CAYMANS ARE HUNTED AND KILLED IN THEIR NATURAL HOMES OFTEN BY BEING CRUDELY SHOT IN THE HEAD SO THAT THEIR SKINS CAN BE TURNED INTO BAGS BOOTS AND OTHER ACCESSORIES. THIS CRUEL TRADE HAS LED SOME SPECIES TO BECOME NEARLY EXTINCT. THEY'RE ALSO CAPTAIN FETID WATER ON CROWDED FARMS WHICH ARE OFTEN STOPPED BY STEALING ADULTS FROM THE WILD AND FORCING THEM TO BREED IN CAPTIVITY. ALTHOUGH THEY CAN LIVE TO BE SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD FARMS CAYMANS ARE KILLED BEFORE THEY EVEN REACH MATURITY. PASSING A. B. TWELVE SIXTY WOULD SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT KILLING EXOTIC ANIMALS FOR THEIR SKINS HAS NO PLACE IN A COMPASSIONATE SOCIETY. PUBLIC SENTIMENT AGAINST THE USE OF EXOTIC SKINS IS GROWING AROUND THE WORLD. CHANEL STELLA MCCARTNEY DIANE VON FURSTENBERG VICTORIA BECKHAM AND NUMEROUS OTHER MAJOR DESIGNERS AND RETAILERS HAVE ALREADY BANNED EXOTIC SKINS FROM THEIR DESIGNS. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FORWARD THINKING STATE AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SET A COMPASSIONATE EXAMPLE BY SUPPORTING A. B. TWELVE SIXTY THANK YOU. HELLO CHAIR COMMITTEE THANK YOU PROUD OF ME MY NAME IS NICHOLAS SOCKET SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION -- I WON'T REPEAT WHAT THE AUTHOR AND HANNAH SAID BUT I WOULD JUST REITERATE THAT -- A POLL WITH THEM LAST YEAR AND BAN ON EXOTIC SKINS AND RETAIL -- AT THE OTHER MENTION THERE ARE PLENTY OF ALTERNATIVES FOR THESE KINDS OF PRODUCTS A WE DON'T NEED TO BE SELLING THEM IN OUR STORES IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD JUST SIMPLY SAY THANK YOU FOR LISTENING THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR -- FOR OFFERING THE BILL AND PLEASE SUPPORT BUILT THANK YOU.

YOU ARE A OKAY SIR LAST OF SPECIAL ORDER -- ITEM -- SO. MR BLOOM AB. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THANK YOU -- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE -- IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION ENACTED REGULATIONS TO RESTRICT THE USE OF SECOND GENERATION ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE. AFTER ALARMING DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE FOUND THAT NON TARGETED WILDLIFE WITH SUCCUMBING. TO SECONDARY INFECTIONS LIKE MANGE DUE TO THE WAY THE RODENTICIDE AFFECTED THEIR SYSTEMS. FOR THOSE OF FIVE YOU MAY NOT KNOW MANGES AND NORMALLY LETHAL -- BUT DUE TO THE EFFECTS THAT ANTI COAGULANT TAP ON THE ANIMALS A BLOCKS THEIR ABILITIES TO FIGHT OFF OR HE'LL NORMALLY -- NON LETHAL AILMENTS POISONINGS AND DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN NUMEROUS SPECIES SUCH AS EAGLES HAWKS FALCONS AL'S BOBCATS. MOUNTAIN LINES AND EVEN THE IMPERILED SAN JOAQUIN KIT FOX IN NORTHERN SPOTTED OWL. THE PROBLEM IS SO SEVERE THAT OVER 70% OF WILDLIFE TESTED IN CALIFORNIA HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO RODENTICIDE STE -- THESE ARE DENNIS SITES POSE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO CHILDREN% PETS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS AS WELL. AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PAT'S NEEDLESSLY DIE EACH YEAR DUE TO RODENTICIDE EXPOSURE. ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS AT UCLA VIRTUALLY EVERY MOUNTAIN LION THAT THE AT THAT UCLA AND THE NPS OF TESTED AND 90% OF THE BOBCATS TESTED FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. TEST POSITIVE FOR ANTI COAGULANT THROW DOWN THE SIDES BOTH FIRST AND SECOND GENERATION. SO AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SIX TO TAKE STRONGER MEASURES TO PROTECT CHILDREN PETS AND WILDLIFE FROM THE UNINTENTIONAL RODENTICIDE POISONINGS BY BANNING THE USE AND SALE OF SECOND GENERATION. ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE STATEWIDE AND THE USE OF FIRST GENERATION ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE ON STATE OWNED PROPERTY. THE OPPOSITION MAY SPEAK OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IF WE WERE TO BAN SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE. BUT THE FACT IS WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHICH HAS RESULTED IN THE UNEXPECTED ONGOING DOUBTS OF NON TARGETED WILDLIFE. NEW ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND MORE HUMANE MEANS OF CONTROLLING RODENT POPULATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING DEVELOPED AND SUCCESSFULLY IS BY PEST MANAGEMENT AND THIS BY THE PAST MANAGEMENTINDUSTRY. IN THIS OFFERS SAID A GOOD DEAL OF HOPE TO US. AT THESE -- INCLUDING TO THE OPPOSITION -- INCLUDE EIGHT NOT A NEW ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE THAT DOESN'T PERSIST AFTER THE TARGETED ANIMAL HAS INGESTED THEM. HI. I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK -- WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND MY WITNESSES HERE TODAY ARE LENDS THE LIARS WITH THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND. AND LISA -- ENDS WITH THE GROUP RAPTORS ARE THE SOLUTION OR RATS OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISS FRIEDMAN AND SECONDED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA -- SO GOT A MOTION AND A SECOND GO HEAD. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LISA -- INS VIANI AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF RAPTORS ARE THE SOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA ECOSYSTEMS PROTECTION ACT WE ARE A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THE ECOLOGICAL ROLE OF BIRDS OF PREY. AND THE IMMINENT DANGER THEY AND OTHER WILDLIFE FACE FROM RAT POISON IN THE ECOSYSTEM. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND AGAIN IN TWENTY ELEVEN COOPER'S HAWKS WERE FOUND BLEEDING TO DEATH ON THE STREET IN MY BAY AREA NEIGHBORHOOD. TESTS REVEALED THAT THE HAWKS HAD BEEN SECONDARILY POISONED AFTER CONSUMING POISON RESIDENTS. THE POISONS FOUND IN THEIR LIVERS WERE SECOND GENERATION ANTI COAGULANT SO STRONGLY ARE MARKETED AS ONE FEEDING KILLS. I QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT SECONDARY POISONING WAS A STATEWIDE PROBLEM AFFECTING ALL OF THE BENEFICIAL WILDLIFE THAT HELP US CONTROL RODENTS NATURALLY OWLS HAWKS EAGLES BOXES MOUNTAIN LIONS BOBCATS AND MANY OTHERS. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN DUE TO THE DANGER THESE PRODUCTS POSE TO NON TARGET WILDLIFE THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION REMOVED THEM FROM CONSUMER SELVES. HOWEVER SCIENTIFIC DATA COLLECTED SINCE THAT TIME SHOW THE PROBLEM HAS NOT IMPROVED BECAUSE THE PEST CONTROL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO USE THESE PRODUCTS WHICH KILL FAR MORE THAN RATS. STUDIES SHOW THAT POISON RODENTS ARE PREFERENTIALLY PREYED UPON BECAUSE THEY ARE SIX SLUGGISH AND EASIER TO CATCH. STUDIES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY UC DAVIS UCLA AND THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOUND THAT THREATENED SPECIES TESTED POSITIVE FOR ROUTE POISON. MORE THAN 85% OF CALIFORNIA MOUNTAIN LIONS BOBCATS AT PACIFIC FISHERS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THESE DANGEROUS POISONS. THE POISONS DID NOT IMMEDIATELY KILL THESE ANIMALS THEY CAN HAVE SUB LEGAL IMPACTS INCLUDING AFFECTING THE GENES THAT REGULATE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. THIS MEANS ANIMALS LIKE BOBCATS MOUNTAIN ON LANDS A COYOTES ARE LESS ABLE TO FEND OFF DISEASES LIKE MANGE. STUDIES ON YOUNG BARN OWLS THAT HAVE CONSUMED POISON RODENTS FOUND LOWER BIRTH WEIGHTS AND SHORTER WINGS AND LEG BONES. OTHER NEW STUDIES JUST COMING OUT HAVE FOUND SECOND GENERATION ANTI COAGULANT IN FISH AND RIVER OTTERS. RAT POISON HAS SO SUCCESSFULLY INFILTRATED CALIFORNIA'S ECOSYSTEMS THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED OUR NEW DDT. THESE POISONS ARE HAVING A CATASTROPHIC IMPACT ON OUR NATIVE WILDLIFE THE LONGER THEY CONTINUED TO BE USED THE MORE HARM WE WILL SEE PLEASE TAKE ACTION TODAY TO STOP IT THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. MORNING COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS LINDSAY LARSON I'M SPEAKING ON HOW THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND AND OUR THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I I WILL BELIEVERS IN THE POINT THIRTY REYES BEFORE I'LL TRY TO KEEP THIS BRIEF BUT I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP ON THIS BILL. WE HAVE HAD -- TWO BILLS BEFORE THIS HER TWO ACTS AS AS LOU MENTIONED ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM MENTIONS -- TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE PROBLEM -- THE DVR REGULATING CONSUMER USE AND ALSO BANS ON STATE PROPERTY. THAT HAS NOT WORKED THIS IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ONLY BANS CERTAIN TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT WILL STILL BE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE CHEMICALS AVAILABLE. TO THE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS TO USE IN ADDITION TO NON LETHAL METHODS AS WELL. THE OTHER ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXEMPTION AS SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE SEEN WE REMOVE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT TALKS ABOUT A PROCESS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. A PUBLIC HEALTH EXEMPTION STILL EXISTS IN THIS BILL. AS REFERRED TO IN SECTION II OF THE BILL. THIS IS THE SECTION DOES NOT PREEMPT OR SIT OR SUPERSEDE ANY FEDERAL STATUTE. THE FEDERAL INSECTICIDE FUNGICIDE AND RODENTICIDE ACT PROVIDES A PROCESS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. SECTION EIGHTEEN OF THE ACT ALLOWS THE AUTHORITY TO ALLOW FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCY THE ABILITY TO GRANT THE USE OF A PESTICIDE PRODUCT WITHOUT REGISTRATION. IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY CONDITION MOREOVER THE ACT EVEN HAS AN EXPLICIT SPECIAL CRISIS EXEMPTION PRISON PROVISION. THAT ALLOWS THE HEAD OF A FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCY. TWO I AM. ALLOWED TO USE THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT. APPROVAL TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. AND IN SHORT JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT SEVENTY EIGHT DOES PROVIDE A PUBLIC HEALTH EXEMPTION WE ARE AWARE OF THIS RISK AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT -- ADDITIONALLY WHILE WE KNOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS SIDE REGULATION AGREE TO A SECOND GENERATION. EVALUATION PROCESS WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATION IS THE NECESSARY STEP IN ORDER TO PROTECT WILDLIFE DPR TO FOURTEEN YEARS THE LAST TIME THAT ENGAGE IN A REEVALUATION. THAT'S THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS THAT ARE GOING TO DIE DURING THE TIME PENDING IF THE RE EVALUATION PROVIDES DIFFERENT RESULTS THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE ROBUST DATA SO FAR. THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATION IN THE FUTURE. LASTLY NOW IS A SCIENCE DEMONSTRATE A CLEAR NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION RIGHT NOW SUCH ACTION IS SUPPORTED BY GROUND SWELL OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR RESIDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. RIGHT NOW THERE'S TWENTY NINE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ENACTED RESOLUTIONS DISCOURAGING THE CELEBRATE DOWN TO SIZE BY LOCAL BUSINESSES. THIS INCLUDES RICHMOND WIN HERE. A SANTA CRUZ AS WELL AS HUMBOLDT COUNTY. LA CITY HAS A BAN -- OUT POLICIES NOT USE WRITTEN SIZE ON CITY PARK LANDS LA CITY WHO'S GOING THERE CRISIS RIGHT NOW STILL HAS A LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM COUNCILMEMBER POCKET WE COULD DISRUPT THAT ARE REALLY QUICK -- JUST IT'S IN CONCLUSION JUST THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE AYE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THANK YOU.

SPEED IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH ROAD IN OUTBREAKS THE LONGER WE TAKE THE MORE RODENTS REPRODUCE. HUMAN HEALTH IS NOT THE ONLY RISK HERE. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR OUR AIRPORTS TO HAVE RATS AND MICE RUNNING EVERYWHERE CHEWING WIRES. NOW MAKING THIS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. WHEN THE WORLD IS WATCHING LOS ANGELES IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT IMAGINE WHAT THEY WILL BE THINKING WHEN RODENTS ARE RUNNING EVERYWHERE BECAUSE WE HAVE BAND ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WROTE IT MANAGEMENT TOOLS OF OUR TIME? AND EXPOSED OUR VISITORS TO THIRD WORLD DISEASES THANK YOU.

SO IT'S A IT'S A REAL CONCERN FOR US. FORTUNATE STAND TO THAT WE HAVE A VARIETY OF RODENTICIDE SO THAT WE CAN CHOOSE FROM. AND OUR INDUSTRY HAS RELEASED. FAVORED THIS PARTICULAR SET OF RODENTICIDE BECAUSE THEY ARE THEIR PROFILE IS VERY FAVORABLE FOR US THEY HAVE A AT AN ANTIDOTE THEY WORK QUICKLY AND THEY DON'T CREATE BAIT SHYNESS. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THEY'RE FAIRLY POPULAR SIMPLY REMOVING THIS TOOL FROM US. COULD HAVE A LOT OF UNINTENDED EFFECTS BECAUSE THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF OTHER RODENTICIDE REMAINING.

ALL RIGHT SO WITH THAT WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE. YES. SO REMEMBER FRIEDMAN THANK YOU I THINK THIS IS YOUR THIRD TIME BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT BY -- COMMAND YOUR STATE TO IT YES STAY TUNED. TO WITH IT YES YEAH. AND I'D LIKE TO ASK TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR TO THE BILL -- I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES AND ENCOUNTER ANIMALS HAVE BEEN POISONED WITH THEIR GENOCIDE -- VERY FREQUENTLY -- ONE WAY TOO FREQUENTLY ALMOST EVERY COYOTE I SEE CERTAIN TIMES OF YEAR IS HAIRLESS AND SUFFERING -- WE SEE DEBT OWLS AND DEAD RAPTOR AROUND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ALL THE TIME -- SO IS MUCH IS THERE IS A USE THEIR POTENTIALLY IS A USE FOR DENNIS SIDE THIS IS CARPET BOMBING. THAT'S KILLING ANIMALS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INDISCRIMINATELY. I SAW A VERY INTERESTING PRESENTATION BY CITY OF VENTURE I BELIEVE UP IN OXNARD WERE THEY THE CITY IT'S I THINK IT WAS THE CITY OR MAYBE IT WAS THE COUNTY HAD DONE. A STUDY WHERE THEY TOOK A SECTION OF DAM. OF NEAR AGRICULTURE AND THEY ONE HALF OF IT THEY USE TRADITIONAL RODENTICIDE WHICH WOULD NORMALLY BE USED ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY HAD A A SERIES WITH A ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT UP THE RAFTER HOUSES YOU DON'T HAVE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF RATS AND OTHER PESTS. IN THE ROAD GENOCIDE SECTION BECAUSE ALL OF THE PREDATORS ENDED UP GETTING KILLED OFF AND THE RIVER. RAFTER AND THE RATS WERE ABLE TO AVOID EATING THE POISON -- BUT NOT A LOT OF OTHER ANIMALS AND WE'RE IS THAT THE RAPTORS SIDE THEY SAW A HUGE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RATS SO WE KNOW THAT THE USING -- OWLS IN RAPTOR WORKS REALLY WELL IN A LOT OF AREAS AND YOUR BILL DOES HAVE A VERY REASONABLE EXCLUSION. IF THERE'S A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. ALSO I THINK IT STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT AS AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE. ON IN LOS ANGELES AND HAVING BEEN ON THE GLENDALE CITY COUNCIL BEFORE WE HEAR COMPLAINTS -- ABOUT THESE POISON WILDLIFE ALL THE TIME THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY CONCERNING TO CONSTITUENTS AND IT'S COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. IN THE EYES OF MY VOTERS THAT WE HAVE THAT THERE IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS TRADE OFF WHEN THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE. SO -- HI YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIME I AM SICK OF SEEING THE SICK ANIMALS. I'M SICK OF HEARING ABOUT MOUNTAIN LIONS IN GRIFFITH PARK -- DYING BECAUSE OF HER GENOCIDE POISONING -- AND YOU KNOW. IF THIS IS SO SAY FOR THE PATENTED THE THE PEST CONTROL COMPANIES HAVE HAD YEARS TO PERFECTED AND KEEP IT OUT OF THE A SECONDARY ANIMAL POISONING STREAM THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO SO I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO TAKE ACTION. AND GET RID OF THE ANTICOAGULANT ROAD INSIDE I'M HOPEFULLY ONCE AND FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. OKAY -- AND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM BOARD MEMBERS. COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE -- ALL RIGHT MISTER BLOOM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- A WEEK I HEARD THE THE OPPOSITION -- FIX A STATE THAT. SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE ARE -- ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ROAD MANAGEMENT TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE AND I DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT. OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY'RE SO SUCCESSFUL AND SO GOOD THAT THEY HAVE THE SECONDARY. AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE -- WITH THE PREDATORS AND AND OTHER ANIMALS -- IT'S A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM IT'S AN ODD NOT SUBJECT TO SPECULATION ANY LONGER WE KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THERE IS AN AGRICULTURAL EXEMPTION THAT IS SET UP -- BUILT IN TO THE BILL -- AND WITH RESPECT TO AMENDMENTS WE RECEIVE THEM YESTERDAY MORNING WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS THUS SIMPLY BEEN NO TIME FOR US TO ADEQUATELY REVIEW THEM TO HAVE THE COMMITTEE STAFF REVIEW THEM -- OR TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT WEIGH IN ON THOSE AMENDMENTS WE WILL CERTAINLY DO THAT GOING FORWARD -- AND TELL YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT ALL TAKE THEM INTO FULL CONSIDERATION AND IF WE CAN INCORPORATE THEM INTO THE BILL -- AND IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT DIMINISH THE IMPACT OF THE BILL WE WILL CERTAINLY DO SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE. BUT THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM IN THIS DOES HAVE FROM THE FROM THE CHAIRMAN DO PASS -- RECOMMENDATION. I PERSONALLY AM GOING TO OPPOSE THE BILL. YOU OFFER A LOT OF THE REASONS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP I MEAN I THINK THAT THIS IS -- YOU KNOW GOING OVERBOARD IN THIS AND THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE A YOU KNOW AS HE SAID AND EFFECTIVE TOOL -- AND THE SPREAD OF DISEASE FROM RODENTS IS A IS A HUGE ISSUE AND MANY OF OUR BANK COMMUNITIES WILL EVEN A RURAL COMMUNITIES -- AND SO YOU KNOW I I CAN'T TINO WITH THAT WITH THIS -- WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL CAN'T SUPPORTED -- AND SO WITH THAT OUT I WILL HAVE MADAM CLERK CALLED THE ROLL.

ALL RIGHT -- I'LL BE BRIEF THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB EIGHT THREE FIVE DIRECTS THE STATE WATER BOARD. TO DEVELOP MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE SAFETY OF FRESH WATER RECREATIONAL BODIES IS RELATED. TO HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS -- HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. OF IT BECOMING AN WELL.

OUR WATER QUALITY PROGRAM FOR THE CREEK TRIBES BEEN MONITORING HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE WE HAVE A HIGHER LEVES VERY HIGH LEVELS WHICH CAN EXCEED GUIDANCE BY OVER TEN THOUSAND TIMES WITHIN THE CLAN US. AND SINCE WE'VE BEEN MONITORING THAT KIND OF HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM WE'VE BEEN SAYING AS MICROSYSTEMS ORIGINAL STUFF WHICH PRODUCES A TOXIN CALLED MICRO. MICROSYSTEMS AS A LIVER TOXIN AND THE LIVER TOXIN IT CAN CAUSE SKIN IRRITATIONS RASHES GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS -- NAUSEA DIARRHEA LIVER FAILURE AND IT'S ALSO A KNOWN CARCINOGEN. THIS IS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE CREEK TRIBE BECAUSE OF THE TIME OF THE YEAR THAT THE TOXINS OF THEIR THAT THEIR HIGHEST WITHIN THE KLAMATH RIVER IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. IT'S TIMES WHEN IT'S CRITICAL FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS TO BE IN THE WATER. NOT JUST FOR RECREATIONAL USE NOT JUST FOR COOLING OFF BUT FOR ISSUES SUCH AS WE HAVE TROUBLE MEMBERS THAT ARE OUT THERE SUBSISTENCE FISHING. AND THEY'RE IN THE RIVER WHEN THAT THERE'S TOXINS PRESENT FROM EIGHT TO FOURTEEN HOURS A DAY THERE FISHING FOR FALL CHINOOK NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. BUT ALSO FOR THEIR COMMUNITY FOR THE ELDERS AND FOR CEREMONIAL USE ALSO OCCURRING AT THE SAME TIME OF THE YEAR. IS THE WORLD RENEWAL CEREMONIES FOR THE CREEK TRIBE THESE OCCUR ALONG THE KLAMATH RIVER AT TRADITIONAL VILLAGE SITES. AND IT'S A TEN DAY CEREMONY AND AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CEREMONY THE MEDICINE MAN TRADITIONALLY BAYS AND DRINKS KLAMATH RIVER WATER WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF A HARMFUL OUT BOOK ALTHOUGH BLOOM AND TALKS AND IN THE WATER YOU DON'T THE MEDICINE MAN TO DRINK. DRINK AND MUCH LESS SPACE IN THE WATER. SO THAT'S AN ISSUE -- I WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT YOU. PAST AB EIGHT THIRTY FIVE WHEN YOU HAVE THIS HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM ISSUE RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL WE HAVE IS DRAFT VOLUNTARY GUIDANCE FOR RECREATIONAL USE. BUT DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT FOR THE PUBLIC SO THAT THEY CAN BE CONSISTENTLY AND ADEQUATELY INFORMED ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS FROM THESE HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS.

BALANCING THE REGIONAL AFFILIATION OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS. TIME AND AGAIN THE VOICES OF MY DELTA NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN SILENCED OR COMPLETELY DISMISSED. THE INTERESTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES HAS BEEN TOTALLY PRIORITIZED. WELL THE GOAL OF THE PROTECTING THE DELTA ECOSYSTEM HAS BEEN IGNORED DIMINISHED. EVEN VIOLATED AT TIMES. IT IS PAST TIME FOR THE COUNCIL TO ACT RESPONSIBLY IN TRULY MEET ITS MANDATE [inaudible] IN STATUTES. THE DELTA MUST BE TREATED WITH THE SAME LEVEL RESPECT. AND THE CO EQUAL GOALS MUST BE UPHELD RATHER THAN DE VALUED. FOR TESTIMONY TODAY AND AND FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE I HAVE WITH ME SOLANO COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND FORMER DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL MEMBERS SKIP THOMPSON. AS WELL AS KAREN MAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE SAVE THE DAY A CALIFORNIA DELTA AIRLINES AND ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS AND DISCOVERY BAY [inaudible] KAREN. THANK YOU JIM GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY LIVES IN THE DELTA ON THE WATERWAY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS. MY NAME IS KAREN MAN I AM THE PRESIDENT OF SAVE THE CALIFORNIA DELTA ALLIANCE A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THE DELTA DELTA. HOWEVER I COME TO YOU AS A LONGTIME RESIDENT AND SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN ENJOYING THE DELTA WATER WAYS SINCE I WAS EIGHT WITH MY FAMILY. I COME TO YOU AS SOMEONE WHO HAS PERSONALLY INTRODUCED PEOPLE WORLDWIDE TO THE DELTA WATER WAYS. EACH AND EVERY PERSON HAS COME OFF THE WATER WAYS JUSTICE CAPTIVATED BY THIS HISTORICAL AND WONDERFUL LOCATION FILLED WITH WILDLIFE BEAUTIFUL WATER. IN NATURE. IT'S PAINFUL FOR ME TO OBSERVE THE TERRIBLE DISCONNECT BETWEEN OUR STATE AGENCIES THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE WORK AND PLAY IN THE DELTA. THIS RESOURCE. THIS RESOURCE IS AN AMAZING PLACE ONE THAT HAS DELL TO USERS DON'T SEEM TO GET TIRE OF TO DATE THE COUNCIL HAS DEMONSTRATED TREMENDOUS BIAS TOWARDS THE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. AND NOT TREATED THE DELTA RESIDENTS AND USERS EQUALLY. IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THEY KNOW THE DOCTOR THE HISTORY THE WONDER THE WILDLIFE THE RECREATION AND THE LIFE LIKE WE DO. IN THE DELTA WE USE THE WATERWAYS WEEKLY YEAR ROUND. DURING THE SUMMERTIME WE ENCOURAGE BOATS TO MEET AND DINE AT THE LOCAL RESTAURANTS ON THE WATER THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN SEEING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE. ENJOYING OUR WATER WAYS ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT GOING OUT FOR DINNER TOGETHER. SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE ENJOY THE MOST INCREDIBLE INDEPENDENCE DAY FIREWORKS CELEBRATION AT MANDEVILLE ISLAND. OR THOUSAND FISHERMEN. SEVERAL THOUSAND FISHERMEN EVERY MONTH COMPETING ON FISHING TOURNAMENTS ALL OVER THE DELTA WATER WAYS. OR HOW ABOUT WATCHING A YOUNGSTER GET UPON SKIS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. THEN OF COURSE THERE'S WATCHING SOMEONE. CATCH THEIR FIRST STRIKE BUT BASS OR SALMON OR STURGEON ARE CATFISH LARGEMOUTH BASS IT'S A THRILL AT ANY AGE. SO AS A RESIDENTS I ALSO SHOP AT ALL THE LOCAL FRUIT AND FOR THE FRUIT AND VEGGIE STANDS. SO I CAN GET THE BEST IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOOD FROM MY COMMUNITY. MY FORMER NEIGHBORS ARE TERRIFIED OF THE PENETRATION OF POTENTIAL SALT WATER TO THEIR WATER SOURCES. THE COUNCIL HAS FORGED AHEAD WITH THE SO CALLED WATER FIX WHICH HAS THE FARMERS VERY CONCERNED. IT WOULD BREAK MY HEART TO SEE THE WATERFRONT COMMUNITIES LOSE THEIR RESIDENTS. AND THEIR UNIQUE DELTA HOME PROPERTY VALUES DUE TO MORE THAN. TEN YEARS OF MESSI CONSTRUCTION WITH COMPLICATED WATER AND OR ROADWAY ACCESS. AS A FORMER MEMBER PRESIDENT OF THE DISCOVERY BAY CHAMBER. I KNOW THE TUNNELS WILL AFFECT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES BETWEEN BETHEL ISLAND. OAKLEY NIGHTS IN ANTIOCH DISCOVERY BAY AND MORE. UNFORTUNATELY THE DELTA STORESHIP COUNCIL HAS PROVEN THAT IT DOES NOT REPRESENT ME ARE MY NEIGHBORS WHO LIVE WORK AND ENJOY THE ENTIRE THE ENTIRE ONE THOUSAND MILES OF DELTA WATER WASTE FOR RECREATION AND LIVELIHOOD. WE NEED TO EXPAND THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COUNCIL AND FINALLY GIVE THE DELTA RESIDENTS EQUAL CONSIDERATION. WE DESERVE AS RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO TREASURE THE HISTORY OF OUR CALIFORNIA DOT TO WATER WAYS. MY FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN ENJOYING THE DOCTOR WATER WAYS FOR FOUR GENERATIONS. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN OR ON THE DELTA WATER WAYS BAY AREA CENTRAL VALLEY TOURISTS LOCAL BUSINESSES AND DISCOVERY BAY BRENT WOULD ANTIOCH OAKLEY NIGHTS AND STOCKTON RIO VISTA. PITTSBURG AND MILLIONS OF DELTA RESIDENTS. AND TAXPAYERS. PAYERS LIKE ME ARE DEPENDING ON YOU TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION TODAY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO INCLUDE MEMBERS ON YOUR BOARD AND OR ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WHO ARE USERS WHO LIVE? WHO KNOWS THE DELTA -- TREASURE THE DELTA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME BY THE WAY. SHOULD YOU EVER WANT A MORE DETAILED TOUR. I PERSONALLY WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOU OUT. ON THE DELTA SO THAT YOU COULD UNDERSTAND THE TREASURE THAT WE ALL LOVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. I BELIEVE IT'S GOOD AFTERNOON VICE CHAIR GALLAGHER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS -- SOLANO COUNTY SUPERVISOR STEVE THOMPSON AND I REALLY WANT TO SAY IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT BILL THAT COULD CHANGE THE WAY. THE DOCTORS VIEWED AND HOW WE TREAT THE DELTA. I'M HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING AS THE AS THE CHAIR OF THAT DON'T TO PROTECTION COMMISSION. AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE DELTA -- STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF ELEVEN AB. ELEVEN NINETY FOUR A SPONSORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER CO SPONSORED BY THE DELTA CAUCUS -- SENATORS DODD TO GALGIANI AND ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- EGGMAN GRAYSON. I AS WELL AS ALL THE FOLKS THAT LIVE AND WORK IN THE DELTA UNDERSTAND THE PARTS OF THE DELTA FOR MUCH NEEDED WATER SUPPLY. THE DELTA REGION IS CRUCIAL FOR MANY THINGS IT'S CRITICAL BUT IN IMPAIRED ECOSYSTEM. AN IMPORTANT FISHERY. IN A VIBRANT AGRICULTURE AMONG ITS MANY OTHER OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ATTRIBUTE. BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE STATE HAS BECOME A BATTLEGROUND. GREATLY IMPACTING THOSE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING AND RAISE YOUR FAMILY HERE. AND THE FOLKS MANY WHO LIVE AND FARM HERE IN FOR GENERATIONS ARE THE MOST IMPACTED BY THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL'S ACTIONS. YES ARE THE LEAST REPRESENTED ON THE COUNCIL ITSELF. THE LOCAL VOICE IS LARGELY MISSING ON THIS BODY. WHILE SERVING ON THE COUNCIL I SAW NOTHING BUT PROFESSIONALISM FROM ALL THE COUNCIL MEMBERS. HOWEVER AND I MEAN NO DISRESPECT SIX OF THE SEVEN MEMBERS ARE POLITICAL APPOINTEES OR COME FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS. SO WHILE PROFESSIONAL THE DELTA SERCHHIP COUNTS OF MAKE UP IS VERY SKEWED. THE ONLY CONSTANT TRUE DELTA VOICE HAS BEEN THE LONE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE. WE ARE NOT ARGUING THAT SPECIAL INTERESTS IN THE SOUTH. DO NOT HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY HERE WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT THE CONSTITUENCY OF THE DELTA. DESERVES DESERVES A REAL CONSTANT AND MUCH STRONGER ROLE IN THE COUNCIL. I HAD THE HONOR PLACE YOUR AND RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE ON THE COUNCIL. AS AT LONE VOICE THERE WERE MANY TIMES WHEN I WAS THE LONE VOICE FOR THOSE THAT WORKED LIVED AND PLAYED IN THE DELTA MANY TIMES WHEN THE STAKES WERE VERY HIGH FOR THOSE MOST AFFECTED. THE STAKEHOLDERS. THE I WAS THE QUIET VOICE ON THIS COUNCIL. MAKING THE COMPOSITION COUNT EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION MEMBER. HAS A TWO YEAR TERM. AND YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW SCIENTIFICALLY DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE LAY PERSON. BY THE TIME WE EAT THE TO ME -- YOUR MEMBER ARE UP TO SPEED IT'S TIME TO CHANGE. SO WITH GREAT URGENCY I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO URGE SUPPORT IN MOVEMENT OF AB ELEVEN NINETY FOUR IN ITS CURRENT FORM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR AND ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT FROM THE PUBLIC. AND AGAIN JUST NAME AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU SUPPORT. MR TURN MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON BEHALF OF SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY A MEMBER OF THE DELTA COUNTIES COCKE AS AS YOU LIKE TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT US WITHOUT US ASK FOR DRIVE IT TODAY THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADELINE COOPER ON BEHALF OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COME ON UP. THANK YOU DENNIS ALBION HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CAL OF SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER AGENCY AND MESA WATER -- WE REGRETFULLY MUST -- OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE DELTA STIR TO COUNSEL THE THIRTEEN MEMBERS. THE MORE MAJORITY OF WHICH ACTUALLY COME FROM IN DELTA INTERESTS -- WE AGREE THAT THE DELTA IS A VERY VALUABLE STATEWIDE RESOURCE AND I THINK WHEN THIS WAS DEVELOPED -- WHEN THE BILL WAS PASSED IN SB TO A MINUTE SORRY AS TWO ONE SEVEN ACTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND? NINE THAT ESTABLISHED ADULT EASTER TO COUNSEL IT ACTUALLY -- WAS A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE THAT RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE STATE OF THE STATE WHAT SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DELTA. I WHEN THEY THEY BALLOTS THE THE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE DUMPSTER SHOULD COUNCIL THEY FOCUSED ON THE THE DELTA HAS IS THE ONLY REGION THAT ACTUALLY HAS A DESIGNATED. MEMBER UP ON THE COUNCIL AND SO ALL THE REST OF THE MEMBERS CAN COME FROM A CROSS SECTION OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS. DIFFERENT -- GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS AND FRANKLY THEY HAVE FOR A AND DIFFERENT DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND THEY HAVE AN THAT REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE DELTAS. ITSELF IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE ESTUARY AND AND THE RECREATION IT WAS DISCUSSED BY THE PROPONENTS BUT ALSO FOR WATER FOR A TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS FOR UP ALL THE VALUABLE RESOURCES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO. THE THIS BILL BASICALLY FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE BALANCE IN THE STATEWIDE -- IMPORTANCE OF THAT ESTUARY. UP WE WOULD ALSO ARGUE AND KIND OF RESPECTED KIND OF THE PROMISE OF BILL THAT THIS IS NOT WORKING WE WOULD ARGUE THE PROCESS IS WORKING IN THE MOST. SIGNIFICANT DECISION THAT THE DUMPSTER TO COUNSEL HAS DONE. IS TO REVIEW THE THE THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX AS THOUGH IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE DELTA PLAN AND THEY DID THAT LAST YEAR. AND THEY QUESTIONED WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MEMBERS QUESTIONED IT IN DELTA MEMBERS QUESTION AND TODAY WE NEED MORE INFORMATION WE NEED SOME ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC. EVALUATION OF THIS TO MAKE SURE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE CO EQUAL GOALS SO THE FACT IS IT ACTUALLY WORKED THEY SENT IT BACK TO D. W. R. D. W. R.. REPROGRAMMED NOW THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL REVIEWS BUT THE WHOLE PROGRAM. ACTUALLY WORKED AND SAID THIS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE DELTA PLAN AT THIS POINT AND CENTER BACK. FROM THE CURRENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PROVIDES FOR A BALANCED PLAN. AND AND CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THOSE TWIN GOALS AND I THINK THE TWO WE HEARD FROM THE PROPONENTS THIS MORNING. THEY WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE THE MULTIPLE THE BILL WILL GOALS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT THE DELTA SPECIFIC INTEREST -- AND SO WE WOULD LIKE -- TO COULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO HOLD BILL COMMITTEE TODAY AND MAINTAIN THE BALANCE THAT THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE LEGISLATION DID THAT WAS A COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION. INCLUDING CLICK CREATING THE THE THE DUMPSTER TO COUNSEL THANK YOU. IN. BRIEF IF YOU COULD. GO AHEAD. AS CHAIR MEMBERS BURKE BROUGH REPRESENTING THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT. WE ARE ALSO KNOWN AS DALY WATERS. WE'RE BY THREE MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA IN THE STATE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR WATER SUPPLY -- COMES FROM THE DELTA OR ITS TRIBUTARIES -- IN THE CASE OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- DEPEND ON THE DELTA ALONG WITH THREE MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND -- SO IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN THE DELTA REFORM ACT WAS HEADED TO THE SIMPLY FOR A COMMITTEE CONSULTANT NAME AL BRANDT WROTE IN HIS FOR ANALYSIS THE FOUNDATION OF THIS BILLS CHANGE. IN DELTA GOVERNANCE IS THE NEW DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL THE FOUNDATION. AND HE WENT ON TO UNDERSCORE THE FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE ACT FOUNDED WATER CODE SECTION EIGHTY FIVE TWO AND TO WHICH SAYS COUNCIL MEMBERS SHALL POSSESS DIVERSE EXPERTISE AND REFLECT A STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE. AB ELEVEN NINETY FOUR WOULD UP INTO THAT STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND WOULD ESTABLISH A MAJORITY REPRESENTING IN DELTA INTEREST YOU KNOW THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNCIL ARE -- QUITE IMPORTANT FROM WHAT LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND THE FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM TO WHOSE FINANCIAL -- FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER A THOUSAND MILES A DELTA -- LEVEES AND OF COURSE. WHAT IS THE DELTA CONVEYANCE SOLUTION -- THAT IS DEEMED CONSISTENT WITH THE DELTA PLAN. OF YOU KNOW. ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTED ON THE COUNCIL -- YOU KNOW ONLY ONE REGION IS CURRENTLY GUARANTEED A SEAT ON THE COUNCIL AND THAT'S THE DELTA ITSELF SILICON VALLEY DOESN'T HAVE A COUNCIL ISSUED ME A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL NEITHER DID SANTA BARBARA THE COACHELLA VALLEY LARGE SWATHS OF THE BAY AREA AND LARGE LOSS OF THE SELF WHEN. TO COME LAST FALL WHEN THE COUNCIL CHOSE NOT TO AFFIRM THE WATER FIX AS CONSISTENT WITH THE DELTA PLAN WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HAD A GUARANTEED SEAT. ON THE COUNCIL AT THAT POINT -- AGAIN IN FAIRNESS TO THE COUNCIL THEY'RE DOING THE JOB THEY WERE CREATED TO DO WHICH IS TO BALANCE THE TWO CO EQUAL GOALS OF ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AND WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY -- WHILE RECOGNIZING THE DELTAS INVOLVING PLACE STACKING THE COUNCIL WITH MAJORITY VOTES OF FOCUSED ONLY ON ONE REGION WHAT SERVICE STATEWIDE PURPOSE. OF THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE DOCTOR REFORM ACT WE ASK FOR YOU TO ABSTAIN OR VOTE. THANK YOU.

SARS DIVERSE FOR THE MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT OF ORANGE COUNTY IN OPPOSITION. KRIS CONNOR PRESENT THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION. OKAY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY A MISTER FRAZIER LET'S CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I LOVE THE OPPOSITION TELLING AT THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL ACTUALLY PULLED IT WERE FOR MEMBERS HAD RECUSED THEMSELVES. ON THE DELTA STORE CHIPS KELSO BECAUSE OF INTEREST THAT WERE NOT. IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE DELTA. THE THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES AS I WILL SAY. OF THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DID. OPPOSE THE DEAL AND IN THIS REGION IT COULD GO FOR IT WASN'T REALLY PULLED. I MEAN IT WASN'T REALLY REJECTED WAS ACTUALLY PULLED BY THE COMMISSION -- WAS MR THOMPSON AND MR GADO FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOW WERE OPPOSED TO THE VIDEO SO YOU HAD A BALANCE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MEMBERS SAID NO. AND A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MEMBER SAID NO -- THAT BEING SAID I NOTICED TODAY ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR I CHAIRMAN GARCIA IS -- OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE FOR THE SALTON SEA AND I WOULD LIKE HIM TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE. EVERY BIT OF A CONCERN DEALT WITH HIS SALTON SEA JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. WHO HAS A A A A A AS AN INTEREST IN THEIR? IN THEIR DISTRICT. I'VE GROWN UP ON THE DELTA. THIS THING IS GONE FROM THE BC DC. TO SOLD. MANY DIFFERENT MACHINATIONS OF WHAT. THEY'VE TRIED TO GET THROUGH NOW IT'S AT WATER FIX. WHAT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO AND AGAIN IT'S IT'S AN EQUAL BALANCE OF? A YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GOVERNMENT. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES AND AND WHAT GOES ON GENERALLY HAS BEEN TO THIS POINT A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INTEREST. IN CONVEYANCE GOING FORWARD -- THE DELTA WE FEEL HAS NOT BEEN FAIRLY REPRESENTED IN THAT AND WE WERE ASKING FOR AN EQUAL BALANCE ON THIS COMMITTEE. AGAIN ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A FAIR SHOT IF SCIENCE PROVES TO BE THE WINNER I WOULD ASSUME THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE FOR THAT PROCESS I WANT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF A THIRD OF THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA. NOW WITH THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF THE STATE SAYING HE WAS NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THE TWIN TUNNELS I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY MISTER CHAIR ONE TOTAL DOWN. ONE TO GO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RIVAL. I WILL TAKE THAT AS THE FINAL CLOSER -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- SO BRING IT BACK HERE JUST SO I'D IT DOES HAVE A DO NOT PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR I'M FILLING IN FOR THE CHAIR. TODAY. I I CERTAINLY SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU AS SOMEONE WHO ALSO. FEELS LIKE HE FEELS A GREAT IMPACT IN MY DISTRICT OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE -- AND DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO SAY AND HOW THAT PROJECT IS OPERATED FOR EXAMPLE AT ALL THAT OR BUILD THEM. YOU AYE I THINK THE CONCERN. YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IS WITH. YOUR EXPAND IN THAT SO GREATLY THIS TO SIX MEMBERS. OF YOUR WHO WOULD BE FROM THE DELTA. CERTAINLY YOU KNOW AT I THINK. MAYBE BETTER REPRESENTATION OF THE DELTA WOULD BE NECESSARY WOULD BE A GOOD THING. BEING AS THOUGH A LOT OF THOSE IMPACTS AND KNOW OUR FELT. LOCALLY -- AND ANY OF THE TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESS OF THE ALL OF THE THE BENEFITS AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME TO THE DELTA ENJOY THAT AND AND BE PART OF THAT AND AND SPEND THEIR MONEY THERE AS WELL READ AND ENJOY THE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THOSE THAT'S THE BALANCE AND MAYBE TRYING TO FIND. YOU KNOW ONE THING I'VE BEEN WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IS WHAT YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT MAYBE WHAT WE NEED IS A BETTER OVER OVERALL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. OF THE ENTIRE STATE WATER PROJECT YOU KNOW LARGELY THAT IS GOVERNED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES RIGHT NOW WHO'S. LARGELY UNACCOUNTABLE -- TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE ELECTED. AND AND MAKES DECISIONS IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS VERY CLEAR -- TO THIS BODY AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE. BEEN OPEN TO IS A MAYBE WE WE CHANGE THE OVERALL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. MAKE IT MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO US. SO I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE BOUNCING THINGS IN WITH THAT -- I WILL. YOUR IF THERE'S A MOTION TO THAT EFFECT IS THERE A MOTION ON ON THIS BILL. THE COURTESY TO OUR MEN. MOVED BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BIGELOW IS OUR SECOND. WITHOUT A SECOND I CAN'T. ALLOW THE BILL TO TAKE A VOTE SO. I WOULD REQUEST RICK RICK CONSIDERATION AND UNDERSTANDING THE WHISKIES FOR DRINKING WATER IS FOR FIGHTING. BUT RIGHT RECONSIDERATION IS NOTICED. ON ON THE BILL [inaudible] WHAT'S A IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO GRANTING RECONSIDERATION BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT. SEE NOW TO BE. IT WILL BE RECONSIDERED BASED ON UNANIMOUS CONSENT. OKAY NEXT WE HAVE. SO A MEMBER BAUER CON. MORE UP I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK YOUR ARM AND HAND OVER TO MR BIGELOW [inaudible] YEAH SOME DISCOUNT WE HAVE A. B. TEN EIGHTY SIX WOULD YOU LIKE TO START YOUR PRESENTATION I WOULD THANK YOU MISTER BIGELOW. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND HOW EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU. I'M JAN PRESENTING AB TEN EIGHTY SIX WHICH AID SMALL FARMS TO CONVERT TO HIRE EFFICIENT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS BY CODIFYING IMPROVING THE EXISTING STATE WATER EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS SWEEPS. THIS PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS US CONSERVE WATER AND ENSURE THAT OUR FARMING PRACTICES ARE GREEN MOVING FORWARD. THOUGH SO THERE'S MORE WATER FOR THE NEEDS OF THE STATE AND ALSO SO THAT WE AREN'T SEEING THE POLLUTANTS GOING INTO OUR GROUND WATER THAT WE SEE WITH FLOOD IRRIGATION SO THIS BILL HELPS SMALL FARMS MOVE INTO A MORE RESPONSIBLE FARMING PRACTICES AND THAT IS. OUR GOAL HERE TODAY I HAVE WITH ME HI BRIAN SHOW FROM THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE ACT -- CULTURAL NECK WORK AND DAVE RUNS DEAN FROM THE QUEUE IMMUNITY ALLIANCE WITH FAMILY FARMERS TO TESTIFY ON THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET ME REMIND ALL THOSE THE PRESENTERS THAT WE HAVE TWO MINUTES AND THEY'LL BE THE SAME FOR THE ANY OTHERS THAT ARE GONNA BE COMMENTING. EXCEPT FOR THE METIS PLEASE BEGIN. NOTED THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS I'M RANCHO BUT THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE NETWORK WERE COALITION OF FARMERS RANCHERS SCIENTISTS AND AG ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO ENSURE THAT OUR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY IS RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE'VE BEEN THE LEADING ADVOCATES FOR THE SWEET PROGRAM SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN AT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DROUGHT IS A PERSISTENT THREAT TO FARMERS. I DESPITE OCCASIONAL WHAT YOU'RE THE RISK OF SEVERE DROUGHTS IS PROJECTED INCREASE 50% IN THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS. WE'VE WRITTEN TO REPORTS ON THE STREET PROGRAM IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ITS IMPACTS AND ALSO TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM. IN THE MOST RECENT OF THOSE WE INTERVIEWED -- FARMERS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS WHO'D WORKED WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SWEEP APPLICANTS. AND APPLICATION REVIEWERS WHO REVIEWED HUNDREDS OF SWEEP APPLICATIONS. I HAVE A SEAT ON A TIME TO GO THROUGH THE ALL OF THE FINDINGS THAT REPORT SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. TO THAT THIS BILL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES. THE FIRST IS THAT PARTICIPATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN EXTREMELY LOW IN PART DUE TO LIMITATIONS OF THE PROGRAM'S GREENHOUSE GAS QUANTIFICATION METHODOLOGY. T. A PROVIDERS AND SWEEP AT REVIEWERS FROM THAT REGION HAVE SUGGESTED A FEW WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT. AND THIS BILL AS PROPOSED WOULD SET UP AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF YOUR GUEST EXPERTS TO HELP WORK THROUGH THOSE PROPOSALS. TO HOPEFULLY IMPROVE PARTICIPATION IN THAT A CRITICAL REGION OF THE STATE. THE SECOND IS THAT YOUR QUESTION OPERATORS NEED TARGETED CULTURALLY COMPETENT TRAINING TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE SWEET PROJECTS. CAPTION COMPANIES CURRENTLY ARE NOT PROVIDING THAT -- BUT YOU SEE A COPPER CENSURE EXTENSION IRRIGATION SPECIALISTS ARE WILLING TO AND HAVETRAINING -- MODULES PREPARED. TO OFFER THAT TRAINING IN THIS BILL AUTHORIZES CDFA TO PROVIDE THAT. SO JUST BECAUSE BY SAYING THAT THIS BILL MAKES A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS THE PROGRAM THAT COME DIRECTLY FROM STAKEHOLDER% FEEDBACK WE'VE HEARD. WE THINK THEY WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND REACH OF THE PROGRAM AND PREPARING THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE FARMERS TO THE NEXT DROUGHT. AND WE SEE THE IS THAT THESE AS CREATING SWEEP TWO POINT NOW -- AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR COMMITTEE STAFF AND CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US AND AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING THROUGH ANY CONCERNS -- TO MOVE THIS IMPORTANT BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE I'M DAVE RUN THIN POLICY DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNITY ALLIANCE WITH FAMILY FARMERS. WE'VE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF SWEEP SINCE ITS INCEPTION BACK DURING THE DROUGHT. IT'S THE ONLY STATE PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON IMPROVING ON FARM WATER USE EFFICIENCY. IT TENDS TO BE FORGOTTEN DURING -- BUDGET DISCUSSIONS PARTICULARLY WHEN IT RAINS -- BUT AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW PHASES AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS. AROUND WATER AS THE CLAIMANT HEATS UP. AS WE TRY TO STOP OVER DRAFTING GROUND WATER AND AND THE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL DEMANDS ARE MADE ON SURFACE WATER. WE NEED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS WE CAN BE DURING THE SUMMER. AND SOMEHOW FIND A WAY TO RECHARGE AQUIFERS IN THE WINTER TIME. WE SUPPORT AB TEN EIGHTY SIX BECAUSE IT'LL FOCUS SWEEP ON SUPPORT FOR SMALLER FARMS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO INVEST IN MODERN IRRIGATION SYSTEMS AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF STATE FUNDS. THE BILL ALSO PROPOSES TO INVOLVE MORE A YOU'RE ENGAGED IN EXPERTISE IN ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM. TO BRING IN CONSIDERATIONS OF WATER QUALITY AND GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY. TO ACTUALLY FUND TRAININGS FOR GRANT RECIPIENTS AND PERHAPS TO ENCOURAGE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS TO WORK WITH FARMERS TO IMPROVE PRACTICES ON THEIR FARMS. PEOPLE WANT MICRO YOUR GAUGE IN BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE YIELDS AND ECONOMIC RETURNS BUT IT ALSO HAS ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF REDUCING RUN OFF. AND STOPPING LEACHING OF FERTILIZERS INTO THE GROUNDWATER. AND SO. THERE'S A LOT OF TRADEOFFS THAT ARE GOING TO OCCUR IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT SWEET COULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF SOLVING WATER PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THAT WOULD LIKE. YES I AM WITH THE UC DAVIS IN ASSOCIATION -- WORLDS AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- WERE AGRICULTURE UNIVERSITY AND OUR NEIGHBORS ARE SMALL FARMERS AND FAMILY FARMERS AND THAT IS WHY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AS WELL AS OUR UNIVERSITY AND ARE. YOU SEE COOPER EXTENSIONS. ARE VERY MUCH INVOLVED WITH MORE EFFICIENT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH OTHERS. NAME AN ORGANIZATION THANK. THREE THREE MITCHELL MAP THE CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION IN SUPPORT. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MAYBE WE CAN MAKE SOME -- WAS JUST GONNA BE ONE SO WE HAVE PLAYED AROUND. I THINK WORK IN MY THANK YOU MISTER TRADE MEMBERS TAYLOR RUSSIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU EDERATION -- UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION IT'S ALWAYS UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO HAVE AN OPPOSITION AGAINST OUR AGRICULTURAL COLLEAGUES -- BUT ON THIS BUT WE NEED FIRST AND FOREMOST LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS AS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT NEGOTIATING ON SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAD. OUR UPS ON THE ISSUES THAT WE HAD -- WITH WE THINK THAT SWEEP IS A PIVOTAL PROGRAM MINUTES HISTORICALLY ALLOWED FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THE WATER AND ENERGY SAVINGS IN A MEANINGFUL MANNER ON FARM -- AND WHILE THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT IS ARE THE COMMITTEE MINUTES ARE AN IMPROVEMENT ON AT THE BASE LINE I THINK THERE ARE FEW OUTSTANDING PIECES THAT DO REQUIRE SOME CONSIDERATION THAT ARE. A DEVIATION FROM HOW SWEET AS MANAGE NOW -- SPECIFICALLY ONE IS THE INCLUSION OF WATER QUALITY AS A NEW OBJECTIVE -- THAT CERTAINLY YOU CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT FOR EDUCATION HAS WATER HAS A WATER QUALITY BENEFITS BUT IT'S NOT MEASURED UNDER THE EXISTING PROGRAM AND THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT HOW SWEET WOULD HAVE TO TRANSITION TO MEASURE THAT -- ADDITIONALLY THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT -- A GROWER FROM APPLYING TO FOR THE DOLLARS OR IMPLEMENTING THE SYSTEM IF THEY CHOOSE TO TRANSITION TO A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WATER USE CROP -- WE NOW WITH THE ADVENT OF SIGMA WE'RE GONNA SEE WATER BUDGETS ALL OVER THE PLACE ON AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS -- AND THERE ARE FARMERS NEED NOW MORE SO THAN EVER FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO THOSE CHANGES YOU MAY ACTUALLY SEE THAT INCREASE WHICH WOULD OBLIGATE YOU OR ALLOW YOU UNDER ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES A TRANSITION TO A HIGHWAY HIGHER WATER USE CROP AND IF WE DO THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THEY'RE USING THE MOST EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE THAT WILL HAVE THOSE GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS ENERGY SAVINGS -- SO IF THE BILL MOVES TODAY WE WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE THE SPONSORS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY -- BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK WE BELIEVE SWEEP ONE POINT OUT -- AND THE EXCESS SORT OF SPEAKS FOR ITSELF SO -- IF WE ARE GOING TO CODIFY WE MEAN NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT CORRECTLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION SEEN. ANGELINE MOVEMENT I THINK THERE'S A LOT. OF BRING IT BACK -- TO MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. SEEING NO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. MAYBE A QUESTION -- FROM MYSELF -- AT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF OF OPPOSITION HERE AND RECOGNIZING. THAT SWEEP IS ONLY IT WAS A REALLY NEVER CODIFIED IT WAS JUST A CURSORY ADDITION IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THESE ACTIONS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT NOW MOVING FORWARD WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COST. HOW DO YOU PLAN ON ADDRESSING THE COSTS OF? DOING THE STUDIES AND ACTIVITIES AS YOU MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF THIS BILL BOTH IN THE PLANE AND IN THE AMENDED VERSION. YEAH SO WE'RE LOOKING AT USING FUNDING FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL THE MEASURE THAT SHOULD COME OUT ABOUT FUND. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE CLARITY TO THAT -- THE CHAIR WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION FOR DIRECTION. THERE WAS A MOTION AND A SECOND WOMAN I'M SORRY MR SEE HAD MADE THAT MOTION IS FRIEDMAN MADE THE SECOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE REMINDER. WITH THAT SAID -- PLEASE -- CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] A WOMEN'S. GERMAN COST. WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO A CLOSE THANK YOU FOR GOD. OKAY I WANT TO SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS BROUGHT FORTH BY THE OPPOSITION WE'VE BEEN IN DIALOGUE WITH THEM AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON DIALOGUE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM WORKS. FOR THE FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA MOVING FORWARD -- AND YOU KNOW I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK FOR EFFICIENT FARMING THAT HELPS PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR WATER SOURCES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS DOES ENJOY FROM THE CHAIRMAN I DO PASSED WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. GALLAGHER. BIGELOW NOW BIGELOW NO CHOI FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA I'D GLORIA CHOLERA. KALRA I THREE OF US. ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVERSIDE BLANCA RUBIO. BLANCA RUBIO AYE SALAS WOULD. FIVE TWO ONE CALL. THAT THE BILL IS ON CALL STILL AND WE HAVE MEMBERS ABSENCE SO WILL BRING THAT UP NGUYEN CARE FOR THE OKAY. SO WE'LL GO TO AGENDA ITEM EIGHTEEN A. B.. FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX MISSED WORK. FOR FIVE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. JUST BEGAN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- MY NAME IS TASHA BOERNER HORVATH AND I WHEN I THINK THE CHAIR MEMBERS FOR HEARING MY BILL. EIGHT AB FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THE PERMANENT PROTECTION OF SAN NO FREE STATE BEACH BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PARKS RECREATION TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. ABOUT PROPOSED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT WOULD ENCROACH OR INTERFERE WITH PARK OPERATIONS. FOR DECADES A PROPOSAL TO CONSTRUCT A MULTI LANE TOLL ROAD THROUGH THE HEART OF THE PARK. THAT WOULD HAVE BISECTED SENT OVER STATE BEACH AND RUIN THE SAN MATTEO WATERSHED. WAS AN ACTIVE THREAT. AFTER ADVOCACY FROM PARK SUPPORTERS ACROSS THE STATE THE TOLL ROAD PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED. AT VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. IN LATE TWENTY SIXTEEN ILLEGAL SETTLEMENT WAS REACHED BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE FOUGHT THE PROPOSAL. ON THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY THAT HAD PROPOSED IT. THIS AGREEMENT WAS FOLLOWED BY SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH CALTRANS ON THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES AGENCY BY WHICH CALTRANS SIMILARLY AGREE TO AVOID. CONSTRUCTION IN THE PARK. CONCERNS REMAIN THAT A NEW PROJECT MAYBE PROPOSED WAS SIMILAR IMPACTS. AB FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX WOULD ENABLE THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW ANY PROPOSED PROJECTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITH ME TOO TWO WITNESSES SO I'LL TURN ON THEM. SO WE HAD A MOTION BY MISTER SEE IN A SECOND BY MISS FRIEDMAN -- PLEASE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONTINUE. GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE -- I'M RACHEL NORTON I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION AND WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX AND THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURNER **** BATH FOR HER. LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT DISTRICT ISSUE. THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER SUPPORTED NONPROFIT THAT INFORMS INSPIRES CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF PARK CHAMPIONS TO BE THE PASSIONATE ADVOCATES OUR STATE PARKS NEED. AT THE FOUNDATION WE CARE ABOUT ALL STATE PARK. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY FAVORITES AMONG THE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WONDERFUL NATURAL CULTURAL AND HISTORIC STATE PARKS AND WE DON'T. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PARKS THAT HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEEN TARGETED FOR DESTRUCTIVE OR INAPPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES ONE OF THOSE PARKS WITHIN AN OVARY STATE BEACH WHICH IS ONE OF THE TOP FIVE MOST VISITED STATE PARKS IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THE PARK PROTECTS THE LAST REMAINING UNDEVELOPED WATERSHED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S HOME TO THE WORLD FAMOUS TRUFFLES BEACH AND IT HOUSES TEN FEDERALLY THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES. AS THE ANALYSIS SUMMARIZES A PROPOSAL FOR A MULTI LANE TOLL ROAD WOULD HAVE BISECTED THE HEART OF THE THREE THOUSAND ACRE PARK AND SEVERELY IMPACTED COASTAL RESOURCES. IN LIGHT OF THAT THREAT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR NEARLY FIFTY YEAR HISTORY THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION ENTERED INTO A LAWSUIT WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TO FIGHT THE PROJECT. AB FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX SIMPLY INSURES THAT WE REMAIN VIGILANT ABOUT ANY ADDITIONAL THREATS TO THE PARK AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD A THREAT MATERIALIZE. GIVEN OUR NEARLY FIFTEEN YEAR FIGHT TO PROTECT CENTENO FREE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THIS PARK AND ALL OUR STATE PARKS REMAIN OPEN ACCESSIBLE AND PROTECTED. WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON LEAST STEPHANIE'S LET MICROPHONE RIGHT OVER TO ENSURE REAL CLOSE SO EVERYONE CAN HEAR. I'M STEPHANIE'S TO GET QUINN WITH THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION AND I'M GOING TO TRUNCATE MY AYE TESTIMONY BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HERE ALSO MORNING. SO ON SPEED WARP I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CAMPAIGN FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR RECOGNIZING THIS. YES WE'VE HAD GREAT MILESTONES SUCH AS THE LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE STARTING TO HEAR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ARTERIAL THROUGH THE PARK. OF COURSE WE STOP THE TOLL ROAD ITSELF -- SO THEREFORE WE URGE YOU TO HAVE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS ISSUE PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT JUST GIVES THE DEPARTMENT AN EASY WAY TO TRACK THIS AND IT'S JUST A SIMPLE MEASURE TO DO IT I ALSO WANT TO STRESS THAT THERE ARE ALSO -- SECRET NATIVE AMERICAN SITES THAT ARE WITHIN THIS PARK SO AGAIN WE URGE AN AYE VOTE SO THAT FUTURE CALIFORNIANS CAN ENJOY THE CULTURAL RECREATIONAL. AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE IN THIS BELOVED PARK. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON TRACY VOTER TAURUS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO EXPRESS SUPPORT IN HALF THE NOT TO RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ENDANGERED HABITATS LEAGUE AND THE ORANGE COUNTY COAST KEEPER THANK YOU. MORE INCOME ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. MIKE LYNCH PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARK RANGERS SUBSTATION OUR ASSOCIATION OPPOSE THE TOLL ROAD AND SUPPORTS THE BILL. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS PER POST BILL [inaudible] SEEING NONE. WAIT A MINUTE DOORS OPENING STE. I SEE NONE. BACK TO MEMBERS MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. MISTER DALI. SELECT A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED -- TYPICALLY WE DON'T. DO THAT JUST NATION THAT REQUIRE SOME A REPORT THIS IS THE FIRST I'VE SEEN OF THIS TYPE OF PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- THAT WE RE WOULD PORT TO THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES OR THE ASSEMBLY NATURI SOURCES WE HAVE SEQUEL LAWS WE HAVE. LOCAL CONTROL LAWS WE HAVE A WHOLE SIX HOST OF LAWS BEFORE IN THE PROJECT IS GOING TO BE. MOVING THROUGH ANY. PARK OR ANYWHERE WE WE HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF ENVIRONMENTAL THE CHECK MARKS IS THAT. TYPICALLY GO THROUGH SO. I'M I'M TRYING TO GET MY MIND AROUND WHY THIS IS NEEDED OTHER THAN ME NAY IF ANYBODY'S GONNA PROPOSING THE AS THEY DID WITH YOUR TOLL ROAD AND YOU'RE ABLE TO FIGHT THAT THERE'S A PROCESS FOR THAT SO HOUSES BILL. WHEN THEY NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT REALLY GOING TO DO I'M CONFUSED OF? THER THE NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE THAT HEY SOMEBODY'S GONNA PROPOSE A PROJECT THROUGH. THIS AREA AT A MINUTE YOU WOULD. FIRST GO TO YOUR COUNTY OR CITY OR WHAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION AND A POLL PERMIT. TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE THEIR SON I'M THIS IS I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT THAT THIS SETS FOR FUTURE. LEGISLATION AND CIRCUMVENTING -- THE PROCESS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. SEC SO I EQUATE THIS TO A MORE OF A NOTIFICATION THIS WAS A HARD FOUGHT BATTLE SAVE TRESTLES WAS WHAT I I KNEW IT UNDER BEFORE I WAS ELECTED THE ASSEMBLY. HAVE BEEN GOING ON AND A HARD WROUGHT COMPROMISE WAS REACHED BETWEEN MANY ACTORS THIS COST TAXPAYERS TONS OF MONEY THIS COST TONS OF ACTIVISTS TIME. AND ULTIMATELY FOUND A COMPROMISE AND THAT COMPROMISE IS REALLY VITALLY IMPORTANT SENATE OVER STATE BEACH SPANS TWO COUNTIES. IT INCLUDES PART OF CAMP PENDLETON WHERE THEY DO MANEUVERS IN THE PARK. THERE'S IT'S A VERY VERY COMPLEX GROUP OF INTEREST AND SO WILL THIS WILL REQUIRE NOTIFICATION SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. AND KNOW WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED AND THE LEGISLATURE COULD THEN ACT ON IT AND I WOULD EXPECT AND I WOULD BE COMING BACK WITH THAT NOTIFICATION. AND RUNNING A BILL TOM TO PROTECT WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN -- A CODIFIED THROUGH LEGAL AND OTHER AGREEMENTS. SO GO AHEAD AND SELECT AND LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING PLEASE YEAH I'M. YES THERE WERE SUCCESS THROUGH A LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT AND THAT IS SPECIFICALLY JUST WITH THE TOLL ROAD AGENCY THEREFORE THEY ARE BOUND THEMSELVES FROM ANY INFRASTRUCTURE. HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY IN OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY SOUGHT TO TAKE AN ARTERIAL ROADS THROUGH THAT SO THERE ARE -- THIS KIND OF PUT A BOW ON THE LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT THAT'S BEEN PART OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND REALLY PUTS US ALL I NOTICE ON IN A VERY MORE PROACTIVE WAY AND ENSURIN THAT THESE PROTECTIONS. ARE IN PLACE AS WELL. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WISHING. TO ASK QUESTIONS MEMBERS. MAYBE IS A LITTLE FOLLOW UP TO THAT MR DAILY US VERY. POIGNANT. AND SOLID QUESTION. THAT RAISES THE ISSUE IF THIS ACTION IS THEN BROUGHT TO THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION AND BROUGHT BACK TO COMMITTEE. THE MOST LIKELY IT WOULD TRUNCATE AND AND THEN TO HAVE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF BEING HER TRUNCATING THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND ALL OTHER LOCAL. ISSUES SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE SHOULD BE A BUYER BEWARE. MOMENT IN SETTING A STATE PRESIDENT. YOU MAY WANT TO THINK THIS THROUGH BUT GIVEN THAT SAID YOU DO HAVE A MOTION. AND YOU DO HAVE A SECOND AND I WOULD. SEE NO ONE ELSE RALLY TO ANY CALLS OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY LET'S CALL ROLE.

SALAS I WOULD I WOULD I WE HAVE SOME MEMBERS THAT ARE ABSENT AND WE WILL HAVE A AFFORD THEM THE OPPORTUNITY COME BACK AND VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH CHECK. IT WITH THE NEXT [inaudible] ONE HELLO [inaudible] IS FRIEDMAN. YOU HAVE AB. SIXTY AND YOU HAVE A BE. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE FIRST. LET'S TAKE NUMBER SIX LET'S TAKE A BE -- SIXTY OKAY THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A SECOND BUT MR SOLACE. HOW DOES BE VERY BRIEF YOU MAY MANY OF YOU SAW THIS BILL LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS JUST AS GOOD A BILL? THIS YEAR IT'S EVEN BETTER AND IT'S ABOUT HAVING A FISSION SEE STANDARDS FOR WATER METERS. WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I DO HAVE -- WITH ME TODAY TREE SEQUENCE FROM AND OUR DC TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TO TELL YOU WHY THIS IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF YOU. A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS TRACY QUINN I'M WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I WILL TRY TO KEEP IT FREE FALL COVERING JUST A FEW TALKING POINTS. OF THE NEED FOR AB SIXTY ARISES FROM THE TENDENCY OF WATER METERS TO PERFORM POORLY WITH THE FLOW THROUGH THE WATER WHEN THAT FLOW THROUGH THE WATER METER IS VERY LOW. THE RESULT IS THAT EVEN WITH BRAND AB RAINY METERS LOW FLOWS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF LEAKAGE ARE EITHER UNDER RECORDED OR NOT RECORDED AT ALL. THE CENTRAL CHALLENGE THAT AB SIXTY SIX TO ADDRESS IS THAT THE CALL CURRENT VOLUNTARY STANDARDS FOR THE ACCURACY OF WATER METERS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE NEED FOR ACCURACY AT LOW FLOWS. THE LACKS. INDUSTRY SPECIFICATIONS HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR DECADES. FOR THE MOST COMMON SIZE OF RESIDENTIAL METERS THE VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY STANDARDS CALL FOR A LOW FLOW ACCURATE TEST ACCURACY TEST OF ONE QUARTER GALLON PER MINUTE. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE A LEAK OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED GALLONS PER DAY COULD BE NOT RECORDED AT ALL. FOR THE LARGER METERS NOW REQUIRED BY SOME UTILITIES THE LOCAL ACTION ACCURACY TEST IS PERFORMED AT THREE QUARTER GALLONS PER MINUTE A HALF GALLONS PER MINUTE AT ONE AND A HALF. INCH METERS. MOST SHOWERS THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE SHOWERS AT ONE HALF GALLONS PER MINUTE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS COULD BE A REALLY BIG PROBLEM -- THE METERS WOULD FAIL TO CABBAGE TO CAPTURE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF LEAKAGE AS WELL AS OTHER INTENDED USES LIKE DRIP IRRIGATION. WHEN A METER FAILS RECORD WATER DELIVER TO SOME CUSTOMERS TO ADVERSE EFFECTS TAKE PLACE? THE UTILITY DOES NOT RECEIVE AS MUCH REVENUE AS IT SHOULD SO IT'S REYES MUST BE INCREASE FOR ALL CUSTOMERS TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. AND THE CUSTOMER GETS NO INDICATION FROM THEIR WATER BILL THAT THEY MAY HAVE A HIDDEN LAKE. AND THEY HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO LOOK. SIMPLY PUT METERS THAT ARE MORE ACCURATE CAN HELP CUSTOMERS SAVE MONEY AND SAY WATER AND UTILITIES CLICK THE REVENUE THEY NEED. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE NEW METERS AVAILABLE TODAY THAT ARE MORE ACCURATE THAN WAS REQUIRED BY THE VOLUNTARY TERRY STANDARDS BECAUSE WE TESTED THEM. A TOTAL OF EIGHTY FOUR METERS WERE TESTED DRAWN FROM SIX PROMINENT US MANUFACTURERS. WE TESTED MULTIPLE SAMPLES OF THE SAME TYPE OF METER AND EACH METER WAS TESTED TWICE. THE RESULTS CONFIRMED AND WERE SIMILAR TO A PREVIOUS TEST BY OUR CITY BY UTAH STATE. WHICH FOUND THAT. THERE IS SOME VARIABILITY IN THE ACCURACY OF METERS AT LOW FLOWS EVEN WITHIN THE SAME METER TYPES. METERS WITH ACCEPTABLE ACCURACY FLOWS LOWER THAN THE INDUSTRY VOLUNTARY STANDARDS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. GREATER LOW FLOW AGASSI NEED NOT APPLY GREATER COST. AS NEARLY ALL OF THE METERS A WE TESTED WERE MECHANICAL METERS DRAWN FROM OUR PARTNER UTILITIES INVENTORIES OF NEW READERS AND THEY WERE NOT PREMIUM PRICED NEW TECHNOLOGY. A STATE STANDARD COULD CUT THE LOW FLOW TEST RATE IN THE THE ONES IN THE VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY STANDARD AND HALF AND PERHAPS EVEN LOWER WITHOUT A MAJOR REDUCTION AND UTILITY CHOICE OF METER SUPPLY. AB SIXTY ALLOWS THE CC UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO SET WATER METER STANDARDS IT ALSO ALLOWS UTILITIES TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE AN INSTALL NONCONFORMING METERS AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY TWO IF REQUIRED UNDER MULTI YEAR PURCHASE AGREEMENT. THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THIS EASY TO SET ONE STANDARD FOR ALL METER TYPES AS THE LETTER FROM DOESN'T WATER AGENCY IMPLIES IN FACT EIGHTY W. W. A. HAS SEPARATE ACTORS THE STANDARDS FOR EACH TYPE OF METER. INCLUDING MECHANICAL METERS -- SUCH A SINGLE JET MULTI JET OSCILLATING PISTON OF AS WELL AS STATIC METERS LIKE THE ULTRASONIC -- METERS MENTIONED. OKAY SORRY -- WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU -- VOTE YESTERDAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE GIVE US YOUR NAME AND POSITION. J. SELECTED WITH THAT'LL STING GILBERT ROBESON SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION OF SUPPORT A PERMANENT POSITION ON THE BILL A HANDFUL OF TECHNICAL ISSUES WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OTHER. MOVING TO A FULL SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SPOT READ WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF DESERT WATER AGENCY. WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING THE AUTHOR STAFF FOR THE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS THE BILL OVER LAST YEAR. A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE DOES THAT WATER RATES IN OTHER OF MY CLIENTS HAD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE AUTHOR. I THINK WE'RE REALLY LEFT WITH THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE NEED IS HERE -- THE AGENCY BELIEVES THAT THE AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION AND THE STANDARDS THAT THAT INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SCIENTIFIC IN INDUSTRY -- GROUP PUT TOGETHER ARE SUFFICIENT THE NEW LAWS NOT NECESSARY. BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL COSTS THE BILL DOES REQUIRE. THE COMMISSION TO LOOK AT THE LIFE CYCLE COSTS. UNDERSTAND THAT THESE LOW FLOW HI IF IT HI READ METERS WHILE THEY MAY CUT. THE ACCURACY AND HOW FOR TALKING ABOUT MOVING FROM A 95297% ACCURACY 298% ACCURACY SO WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE A 1%. THE SIGNAL THAT THE CONSUMER WILL RECEIVE FROM THAT MORE ACCURATE METER WILL NOT BE WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE. BECAUSE WE BILL THEN ONE HUNDRED CUBIC FEET. INCREMENTS AND FOR USERS FOR TYPICAL SINGLE FAMILY HOME THAT DON'T USE A LOT OF WATER IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE NEARLY ONE YEAR AND A CITY DIFFERENT SO. BE CAREFUL WITH THE POTENTIAL COSTS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS BILL WE THINK THE A. W. DAY. W. W. A. DOES A GOOD JOB IT SHOULD CONTINUE BE RELIED ON WITH US FOR A NO VOTE. THE OTHER OPPOSITION. HAD SEEN THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE I GUESS WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY IS MISTER WOULD -- SORRY BY THE MS GARCIA AND SECONDED BY MISTER SOUTH. YES MISTER DOLLAR SO -- JUST A QUESTION I KNOW THIS IS THE POLICY COMMITTEE NOT THE FINANCIAL COMMITTEE WHICH IS SOMETHING I HAVE CONCERT WITH THAT CAN YOU TELL ME. SO GIVE ME AN IDEA SO I HAVE REPRESENT. VERY SMALL COMMUNITIES WITH WATER SYSTEMS AND SO WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT DO YOU PERCEIVE IT TO BE. WHERE WHERE'S THE POINT GOING TO BE MEASURED OUT I GUESS IS SO YOU'RE MAJORING AT THE? DISCHARGE WERE YOU DISCHARGED INTO THE SYSTEM OR AT THE WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR ALL THESE DIFFERENT THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANOTHER'S SYSTEMS OUT THERE SO YEAH THIS IS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HOME BEATER AND JUST TO CLARIFY -- THE GENTLEMAN WHO JUST SPOKE WAS REALLY COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE ACCURACY PERCENTAGE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FLOW THAT THEY CAN MEASURE. SO THE METERS THAT THAT ARE OFTEN USE NOW DON'T RECORD THOSE LOWER FLOWS SO IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF A 1% DIFFERENCE IT'S RECORDING. A MUCH HIGHER -- IT'S IT'S RECORDING THE WATER -- THAT RIGHT NOW IS NOT BEING REALLY CAPTURED -- AND I JUST WANNA ALSO POINT OUT THAT LAST YEAR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO -- FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAD HAD A TWO MILLION DOLLAR OVER CHARGE FOR CUSTOMERS FROM AN ACCURATE METERS. AND WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE OTHER MUNICIPALITIES RUN INTO PROBLEMS WITH METERS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S OF CONCERN TO ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST OF TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT THERE. TO DO YOU ENVISION WHAT THIS BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT IS A PHASE IN PROCESS SO SO THIS IS THE COST AND SO WE'RE BEEN WE'VE IN THE COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT I REPRESENT. ARE BEING NICK THEY'RE BEING CHARGED WITH A LOT OF TASK AND THERE'S NO ABILITY TO RECOUP THE COST. YEP PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN WHICH ALLOWS A TWO THIRDS VOTE BY THE PEOPLE ARE BEING TAXED OR FEET OR WHATEVER WHAT DO YOU. WHERE FRAUDULENT PUT IT SO I'M GOING TO YEAH I'M TRYING? TO GET MY MIND AROUND WHAT THE HOW THIS IS GONNA BE IMPLEMENTED AND THE TECHNOLOGY. THE TECHNOLOGY DIFFERENCES IN WHAT WE HAVE NOW VERSUS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO REGULATE YEAH SO WE'RE NOT -- ASKING FOLKS TO TO INVEST IN A NEW TECHNOLOGY -- WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A VARIETY OF METERS THAT ARE OUT ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW AND SOME PERFORM BETTER THAN OTHERS EVEN WITHIN EACH CLASS TYPE SO? MECHANICAL METERS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MORE AFFORDABLE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST COMMON AND EVEN WITHIN THOSE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MECHANICAL METERS SOME PERFORM BETTER. AND SO WE'RE JUST ASKING IS THAT CC SET STANDARDS SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR WATER UTILITIES ARE. PURCHASING METERS THAT CAN MEASURE AT THOSE BUT THOSE X.. EXTENDED LOS LOBOS THERE SHOULD BE A COST DIFFERENCE TO THE WATER DISTRICT BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY METERS OTHER THAT ME WHAT WE'RE ASKING. FOR THEY WON'T HAVE TO REPLACE WHAT THEY HAVE WE'RE NOT ASKING THEM TO GO IN WE EVEN SAYING THAT THOUGH IF I WILL. WATER UTILITY HAS A CONTRACT A MULTI YEAR CONTRACT TO BUY A CERTAIN METER THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PURCHASE THAT -- THROUGH A DATE CERTAIN AND SO THERE THERE SHOULD BE A HUGE COST IMPACT TO A WATER SUPPLY THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THE RIGHT BRING IT BACK WE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN I'VE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OKAY -- SO THIS IS A DO PASS. RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS GALLAGHER NO GALLAGHER NO BIGELOW. BIGELOW NO CHOI. CHU. DALY NOT VOTING DALY NOT VOTING FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN I CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA I'D GLORIA KALRA. COLOR I'D LOSE REVIEWS THREE OF US [inaudible] ROBERT RIVAS BLANCA RUBIO. BLANCA RUBIO NOT VOTING SALAS. SALAS I WOULD [inaudible] WOULD I TWO FIVE TO TO CONTROL OKAY OF FIVE VOTES THERE WILL EVEN ON CALL. THANKS AND WE HAVE YOUR SECOND BILL UP NOW A. B. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THANK YOU AB FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AUTHORIZES CALIFORNIA'S DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO IMPOSE AND COLLECT CIVIL PENALTIES FROM LOCAL PUBLIC ENTITIES. THAT FAILED TO SUBMIT WATER RELATED REPORTS IN PLANTS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED TO DELIVER YOU ARE UNDER EXISTING LAWS. WHILE EACH OF THE SEVEN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED UNDER THE BILL ARE REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW THE LAW IS GENERALLY SILENT ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF NON REPORTING. NONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS OR COMPANY BY GENERALLY APPLICABLE PENALTY FOR THE FAILURE TO MAKE A TIMELY SUBMISSION TO W. R.. AS A RESULT COMPLIANCE WERE WRITTEN WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IS VERY SPOTTY ACROSS THE STATE REPORTING COMPLIANCE FOR URBAN WATER LOSS AUDIT REPORTS IS AROUND 90%. WHILE REPORTING BY CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THEIR PERMIT PROGRAMS FOR THE WATER EFFICIENCY OF NEWLY IRRIGATED LANDSCAPES IS ONLY ABOUT 35%. WITHOUT EFFECTIVE SANCTIONS FOR NON REPORTING LOCAL ENTITIES ARE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR LATER MISSING REPORTS IN PLANS FOR THE MORE D. W. R. HAS NOT CREATED OR PUBLISHED A MASTER LIST OF ALL THE LOCAL ENTITIES REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH WATER REPORTING LAWS. THISMAKES IT DIFFICULT TO KNOW THE RATE OF NON COMPLIANCE AND WHICH DISTRICTS ARE CONSISTENTLY IN NON COMPLIANCE. THE LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH THESE WATER REPORT A WATER PLANNING AND REPORTING LAWS MAKES IT DIFFICULT PRETTY W. R. TO ADEQUATELY DO ITS JOB. AND FOR THE PUBLIC TO ASSESS THE WORK BEING DONE BY THEIR LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE CHARGED WITH MANAGING WATER RESOURCES. AB FOURTEEN FIFTEEN CREATES A FAIR AND EQUITABLE FRAMEWORK FOR D. W. ARE TWO ASSESSABLE PENALTIES UPON LOCAL PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT FAILED TO SUBMIT PLANTS AND REPORTS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW. PENALTY LEVELS ARE VERY MODEST DO YOU HAVE YOUR IS AUTHORIZED TO REDUCE OUR WAIVE THE PENALTIES ENTIRELY UNDER. SPECIFIED CONDITIONS A PORTION OF THE FUNDS RECEIVED AS PENALTIES AS DIRECTED TO SUPPLEMENT AN EXISTING FUND TO PROVIDE LOANS TO WATER AGENCIES FOR WATER CONSERVATION. THE BILL ALSO FIXES THE KNOWLEDGE AND DISCLOSURE GAP BY REQUIRING DEEP YOU ARE TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THE LOCAL ENTITIES THAT ARE NON COMPLIANT. TO AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE CAN NO. WITH ME TODAY IT AND BY THE WAY OUR GOAL IS TO GET COMPLIANCE IT'S NOT TO YOU KNOW PENALIZE AGENCIES BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE EVERYBODY IS COMPLYING AND SOME PEOPLE AREN'T JUST SHIRKING THE REQUIREMENT. WITH ME TODAY IS A ROW HE SHARMA WITH AN RTC TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. OKAY WHEN THIS IN SUPPORT GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS ARE HE SHARMA I'M HERE WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB -- FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IF THERE'S ONE MESSAGE THAT I HOPE YOU ALL TAKE AWAY FROM MY TESTIMONY TODAY IT'S THIS. DATA HAVE VALUE. WHEN THE ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING CRITICAL WATER DATA DO NOT COMPLY WITH LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THE PUBLIC PUBLIC IS LEFT WITH AN INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE PICTURE OF HOW WATER IS USE DISTRIBUTED AND MANAGED IN THE STATE HERE'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE? COMMUNITIES RESIDENTS AND FARMERS CAN USE THAT DATA THE WATER DATA FROM THESE REPORTS TO HOLD THEIR WATER SUPPLIERS AND MANAGERS ACCOUNTABLE. BUT WHEN 56% OF FARM GATE TO LIVE REPORTS AND 16% OF RECENT ACT WATER MANAGEMENT PLANTS ARE MISSING THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS STIFLED. WHEN WATER DATE IS ALLOWED TO LEAK THROUGH THE DATA CRACKS PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO USE THAT DATA IS RESTRICTED? AND LIKE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THERE NO CURRENTLY NO PENALTIES FOR NON COMPLIANCE WHICH MEANS THAT THE ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. ARE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT NON COMPLIANCE. THESE WATER DAY LEAKS MEAN THAT D. W. ARE THE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR USING THIS INFORMATION TO INFORM THEIR WATER MANAGEMENT DECISIONS CANNOT ADEQUATELY DO ITS JOB. THANKFULLY AB AT WE CAN FIX THIS LEAKY A WATER DATA PIPELINE -- WITH A. B. FOURTEEN AT FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WHICH PROVIDES A TOOL FOR D. W. R. TO TIGHTEN ITS ENFORCEMENT OF WATER DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WATER IS ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. AND D. W. R. CANNOT MANAGE WHAT IT DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MEASURE SO WE STRONGLY URGE YOU GAVE OUT ON A. B. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE THE TERRACOTTA FOR NEW AND SUPPORT. TRACY QUINN FOR SEAL CV IN SUPPORT. N. WITNESSES TUBS ISSUE HISTORY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BABRI BUT WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF DESERT WATER AGENCY ELDORADO IRRIGATION DISTRICT IN VALLEY ATWATER COALITION. MY CLIENTS UNDERSTAND THEIR POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THE STATE AND THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS OF THE LEGISLATURE WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY PERFORM THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. HOWEVER. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE OR NECESSARY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPOSE TO AUTHORIZE AN AGENCIES IMPOSE CIVIL PENALTIES. FOR THESE -- RATHER BURDENSOME AN ONEROUS STATE MANDATES. A LOT OF THE INTERESTS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPEL TO COMPLETE THESE REPORTS ARE THE SMALLER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THESE ARE SERVING. THREE THOUSAND TO LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. AND HAVING TO DO THERE'S REPORTS IS A SIGNIFICANT COST BURDEN ON THOSE. I'M NOT SUGGESTED THEY NOT DO THE REPORT COMPILED AND COMPLY WITH THE LAW I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT. IT'S BETTER FOR THE STATE TO OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES WERE AND A REGULATORY APPROACH TO ASSIST THESE SMALLER SYSTEMS AND COMPLYING WITH REPORT. THE SECOND POINT THAT WE WOULD RAISE IS THAT. WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH RESPECT TO MAKING IMPROVEMENTS REFORMS FOR THE AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT PLANTS. AND AS YOU WILL READ COMMITTEE WILL RECALL IN THE MAKING WATER CONSERVATION WAY OF LIFE FRAMEWORK THAT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION PUT FORTH IN IN THERE WAS A HEAVY RELIANCE ON CIVIL PENALTIES TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE. STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGED WITH THE WITH THIS AUTHORED WITH THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY MOVE AWAY FROM CIVIL PENALTIES TO OTHER MEANS OF ACHIEVING COMPLIANCE. WITH RESPECT TO ADD WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS WE NEGOTIATED A COMPROMISE WHERE IF AN AD WATER SUPPLIER DID NOT DO THE PLAN. THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES COULD WRITE THE PLAN AND CHARGE THAT. WATER SUPPLIER FOR DOING THAT PLAN IF THE WATER SUPPLIER FAILED TO COOPERATE WITH THAT EFFORT. THEN THEY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES WE THINK IT WAS AN ELEGANCE AN APPROPRIATE COMPROMISE ONE THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THIS AUTHORS BILL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW A. B.. SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT NOW COMES THIS BILL TO IMPOSE A CIVIL PENALTY OUTSIDE OF THAT PROCESS. THE FINAL POINT WITH RESPECT TO SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. THE PENALTY THAT WE NEGOTIATE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH RESPECT TO SIGMA AND TRUST ME EVERY WORD IN THAT BILL THAT LAW WAS. VERY. HOTLY DEBATED AND DISCUSSED. THE PENALTY FOR NOT DOING A PLAN IS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TAKES OVER YOUR YOUR BASIN. SO WE DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE A CIVIL PENALTY OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR A THOUSAND DOLLARS WE THINK. FOLKS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE STATE WERE COMING IN AND CONTROLLING GROUNDWATER EXTRACTIONS IN THESE AREAS. THOSE PLANS AREN'T EVEN DO AND TELL TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND AND YET HERE WE ARE AT THE BILL TO US ESTABLISH A CIVIL PENALTY. ONE WE GIVE FOLKS. WATER DISTRICT A CHANCE TO COMPLY WITH THESE MULTIPLE STATE MANDATES THAT HAVE LARGELY BEEN ADOPTED SINCE THE TWENTY TEN AND THEN SEE HOW WE'RE DOING AT THAT POINT SO WITH RESPECT QUESTION OF A THE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEE NOW WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. FOR THE AUTHOR. YES MISTER BIGELOW. IF FOR THE AUTHOR MAYBE IT'S JUST ONE OF THE NERDY THINGS INSIDE THE BILL -- WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE NON COMPLIANT LIST BEING SUBMITTED ONLY TO THE MAJORITY PARTY LEADERS SUCH AS THE SPEAKER PRO. THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE. WHY IS WHY IS THAT ELEMENT IN THERE I SUPPOSE THAT WE COULD DISTRIBUTE THE NON COMPLIANCE LISTS HIM MORE TO EVERYBODY I MEAN? THAT IS WELL REAL REASONS THAT'S REALLY THE PART OF THE QUESTION I WAS WANTING I WAS A REASON FOR THAT. AND IF THERE WASN'T A REASON MY NEXT. ASK COULD BE CAN WE JUST DO THAT FOR ALL EVERYONE TO BE. PUT ON NOTICE. HOPE THE WHITE YES SURE I DON'T SEE WHY DON'T YOU YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO INCLUDE THAT AS YOU MOVE. FOR A PRESS WE COULD I'M BIGGEST TRADITIONALLY IN THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEES. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THINGS OUT TO BOTH SIDES IS THAT. YEAH WE WERE IT'S WHAT THIS WASN'T AT ALL ABOUT SIDES IT WAS USED WE WERE JUST PICKING STANDING SO I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE NASTY THINGS YEAH NO THAT'S FINE. NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. I STILL DRUG STRUGGLE WITH MUCH OF THE BILL BUT I I THERE WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE NERDY THINGS YOU KNOW. LOOKING THROUGH THERE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP. IN EXPLAINING IT. THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- MAYBE JUST IN IN YOUR CLOTHES. YOU KNOW MAYBE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MR RE BROUGHT UP -- WITH REGARD TO HEY WE HAD. SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT I THINK ESPECIALLY WITH AG DISTRICTS WERE CUT ALREADY HAVE THIS PROCESS IN PLACE AND NOW IT SEEMS LIKE HERE COMES ANOTHER. YEAH POTENTIAL PENALTY. IS THIS MAY BE TOO TOO SOON. MAYBE SEE HOW SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT IS IMPLEMENTED. WELL THIS IS NOT ONLY FOR SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT IT'S FOR OTHER -- REPORTING AS WELL AND WE DO KNOW THAT THEIR AGENCIES THAT FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN OUT OF COMPLIANCE. AND YOU KNOW YOU HEARD IT RIGHT THERE THAT A LOT OF THE AGENCIES CONSIDER. WHAT WE DO TO BE WITH AT OUR WHIM YOU KNOW ONEROUS ALL OF THAT THIS CLEARLY AN ATTITUDE I THINK WITH SOME AGENCIES THAT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE -- TO COMPLY I MEAN THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING SO IF AGENCIES ARE WILLFULLY NOT COMPLYING THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO GET THEM INTO COMPLIANCE THIS IS WE'RE TALKING SUCH A SMALL YOU KNOW WHAT A NOMINAL AMOUNT BUT IT WOULD IT'S REALLY INTENDED TO GET THEIR ATTENTION. AND TO SAY IT'S NOT JUST OUR WHIMS WE DO THIS WITH INTENTION AND WE EXPECT THESE REPORTS TO BE GENERATED. AND I WILL SAY ALSO WE HAVE ANOTHER BILL THAT'S GOING TO BE SEEN BY THIS COMMITTEE IT MAY HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH ON CONTENT I'M NOT SURE THAT. THAT I DON'T REMEMBER THAT STREAMLINES THE REPORTING TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE AGENCIES SO THAT IF THEY WANT TO THEY CAN JUST DO THE REPORTING ONCE A YEAR INSTEAD OF HAVING TO LOOK EVERY MONTH TO SEE WHAT'S DO. SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS RED TAPE FOR A LOT OF AGENCIES WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT AND REDUCE IT AND MAKE IT EASIER AT THE SAME TIME. BUT YOU HAVE TO IT WHEN YOU HAVE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLIED. WHAT DO WE DO WHAT ELSE CAN WE POSSIBLY DO AT THIS POINT -- AND IT DOES SAY THAT YOU HAVE YOUR CAN WAVE OF PEOPLE ARE MAKING pTOWARDS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS -- SO I THINK THAT IT'S VERY REASONABLE AND IF AND IF THE AGENCIES. DON'T WANT. TO HAVE THIS ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY THEY CAN JUST COMPLY WITH THE LAW. OKAY -- WELL THAT IT DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR. THE AYE. FOR ME PERSONALLY I THINK. THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF WE WANT TO BRING PEOPLE INTO COMPLIANCE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS. AS A SOLOMON DALLY BROUGHT UP -- THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR REVENUES AS IS. AND KEEPING UP WITH ALL THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE -- AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS AS WE MOVE INTO CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE. AS YOU'RE. HAVING THOSE RATE PAYERS -- CONSERVE. IT ALSO BECOMES ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THAT REPAIR -- BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE YOU'VE NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY CAN SERVE THEIR THE END UP ACTUALLY PAYING THE SAME SOMETIMES ANSWER. YOU KNOW APPLY TO THEM AS YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THESE PROVISIONS SO. YEAH -- AND THEN IF WE HAVE A FINE LEVIED UPON THE ALTERNATELY THAT'S A RATE PAYER THAT'S GONNA PAYING. FINES AS WELL IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE THE DIRECTORS OF THAT DISTRICTS US IS. I THINK FOR SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS IT'S IT'S IT'S BECOMING HARDER. TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THEN ALSO HAVE IN REVENUE STRESSES. NO -- ALSO THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH WITH COMPLAINTS SO. SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY. YOU WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU AND MAYBE SOMETHING THAT COULD. CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THAT FOR SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING. AND WHAT THAT'LL DO NOT INCLUDE CULTURAL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE. MOST -- SORRY I DID NOT GET HIM. MOTION BY MISTER KALRA AND SECOND BY MISTER WOOD THANK YOU FOR CATCHING THAT. ALL RIGHT SEVENTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. GALLAGHER NO GALLAGHER NO BIGELOW. NOT BIGELOW NO CHOI. CHOICE NO. TO DELHI.

THREE TO FOUR OKAY HAS THREE BUILT SIMILARLY THAT A COUGH -- MISTER GLAZER I BELIEVE YOU ARE PRESENTING FOR MISTER LEVINE TODAY -- AND SENATOR IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE GOOD TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME SO AB A SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE. BOTH HAVE SIMILAR BILLS ON THE SUBJECT THIS YEAR AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS. AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT SMOKING OUR STATE BEACHES AND PARKS. CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO SOME OF THE NATION'S BUT SCENIC BEACHES AT PARK LANDS. FOR THE PARKS AND BEACHES ARE MANAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. AND DAD. IT HAS IT'S A WONDERFUL GREAT EXPANSE OF HOLDING OF THE STATE AGENCY. AS YOU KNOW SECONDHAND SMOKING LITTERING OF CIGARETTE **** IS DETRIMENTAL THE HEALTH OF OF VISITORS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. CIGARETTE **** AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY LITTERED ITEMS ON EARTH. FOR THE LITTER RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 60%. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THEY WERE THE MOST COLLECTED ITEM WORLDWIDE. DURING INTERNATIONAL CALLS TO CLEAN UP DAY. HOW TO TESTIFY? IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IT. IS ROBERT UNIONS WITH CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY. MOVED AND SECONDED -- MISTER MISTER KALRA MISTER WOULD -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROBERT NING AS I'M WITH CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE -- AND WE ARE HAPPY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- CIGARETTE **** ARE THE MOST COMMONLY FOUND ITEM DURING A BEACH AND WATER WAY CLEANUPS RANKING TOP TEN MOST COLLECTED ITEMS. ALONG WITH PLASTIC BAGS AND STYROFOAM -- TAKEN CONTAINERS DATA FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN INTERNATIONAL COASTAL CLEANUP REVEALED THAT CIGARETTE ****. BOB WHERE THE NUMBER ONE MOST COLLECTED IN BEACH CLEANUPS IN CALIFORNIA. THE CIGARETTE **** NOT ONLY POSE CHOKING AND POISON HAS OR TO WILDLIFE. THAT MAY. THAT MAY MYSTIC THE LETTER FOR FOOD BUT THE TOXINS CAN LEAD FROM THESE BUT ALSO DETRIMENTAL TO WATER QUALITY AND CAN LEAD TO HUMAN WILDLIFE HEALTH CONCERNS. NUMEROUS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE HAVE ALREADY. ADOPTED ORDINANCES TO BAN SMOKING ON PARKS AND PUBLIC BEACHES. THIS MEASURE WOULD BRING THE ENTIRE STATE UNDER UNIFIED POLICY THAT WOULD REDUCE. OF CIGARETTE LETTER AND POLLUTION TO OUR PARKS BEACHES AND OF WATERS THANK YOU. OKAY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TRACY BYRD A TARA SOME HALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION. THERESA BREAKAGE ON BEHALF OF HEAL THE BAY IN THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN SUPPORT. MORE IN COMMON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. CAN'T DO BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT AND I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED BY MY COLLEAGUES AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA TO CONVEY THEIR SUPPORT AS WELL. ZACHARY CORE BUT WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN SUPPORT. HI WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE GERMAN MEMBERS OF THE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL INSURERS PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARK RANGERS ASSOCIATION. ALTHOUGH THE STATE PARK RANGERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY SUPPORTS THE BAN ON SMOKING IN THE PARK WE HAVE TWO CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. IN OUR POINT OF VIEW COMES DIRECTLY FROM. THE RANGER IN THE FIELD WAS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCCESSFULLY. IMPLEMENTING THIS BAND -- OUR CONCERNS THIS THE MORE MINOR CONCERN IS THE BAIL AMOUNT CURRENTLY BILL MONTHS TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS. VERY LOW AND INCONSISTENT WITH -- THE MAIL AMOUNT FOR THE STATEWIDE SMOKING BAN ALL LOCAL BANDS. THE STATE WIDE ONE IS UP TO HUNDRED AND UP TO FIVE HUNDRED MULTIPLE ARE CALIFORNIA STATE PARK REGULATIONS AS INFRACTIONS HAVE A A VIOLATION AMOUNT FINE OF UP TO A THOUSAND AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT THE AMOUNT THAT THE DA'S IN THE COURTS DECIDE THE ACTUAL BAIL AMOUNTS -- DEPENDING ON THEIR LOCAL CONDITIONS -- OUR SECOND MORE SERIOUS -- CONSIDERATION HAS TO DO WITH THE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN THE RELIGIOUS BELIEF LANGUAGE THE COULD EASILY MAKE ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIELD BY OUR RANGERS IN THE FIELD. LARGELY IMPOSSIBLE. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT -- FIELD RANGERS HAVE NO WAY TO VERIFY A PERSON'S PERSONAL BELIEF AND IT'S VERY HARD FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN. A PERSON CAN SIMPLY SAY. I HADN'T I'M SMOKING IS MY PERSONAL BELIEVE FOR RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND THE WORD COULD EASILY GO AROUND IS THAT WOULD AND SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THESE ARE THE MAGIC WORDS. WE FEEL THAT THE RANGERS NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE. WE THINK THAT JUST A MINOR PER MINOR AMENDMENT TO THIS PROPOSAL TO TAKE OUT THE WORD BELIEVE AND PUT IN SOME LANGUAGES SAYS THE GOOD FAITH EXERCISE OF A RELIGIOUS PRACTICE OR CEREMONY. WOULD GIVE RANGERS THAT TOOL. THE REASON IS EVEN PRACTICE AND CEREMONIES INSTEAD OF BELIEVE ALLOW THE FIELD RANGER. IN SITUATIONS OF DUBIOUS CLAIMS OF RELIGIOUS SMOKING WHICH PROBABLY REPLY TO NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SMOKE. TO INQUIRE ABOUT THAT RELIGIOUS PRACTICE OUR BELIEF WILL GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF HANDLES WE DO AND MANY OF OUR VIOLATIONS TO THE INTENT OF THE PERSON. AND WE'RE LIMITED TO PERSON JUST BEING ABLE TO SAY IT'S A BELIEF -- ALTHOUGH THIS IS A SMALL CHANGE THE RANGERS SOLICITATION FEELS WE GIVE THE FIELD RANGER ENOUGH OF A TOOL DETERMINE TO BETWEEN ORDINARY SMOKING. AND GENUINE ARTICULATED RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER LYNCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SCOTT ST PLACE I'M A CITIZEN ACTIVIST AS WELL AS AN AVID VISITOR OF OUR CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AFTER MUCH RESEARCH I WROTE THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS SMOKING BAN LEGISLATION AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED EVER SENSE. THAT SAID I HAVE THREE ISSUES REGARDING THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF AB. ONE SEVEN ONE EIGHT FIRST ONE BEING FINE AMOUNT A SECOND BEING THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM EXEMPTION AND THE THIRD BEING THE COST. THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THE FIFTH INEFFECTIVE PROPOSE FINE AMOUNT OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR VIOLATIONS. MY ANALYSIS OF OTHER STATE PARKS SMOKING BAN FINES REVEALS OREGON STATE PARK FINES UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS NEW JERSEY STATE PARKS START AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND GO AS HIGH AS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. HAWAII STATE PARKS DO NOT EVEN HAVE A SET FINE AMOUNT. TWENTY FIVE BUCKS IS ABOUT THE SAME COST TO THREE PACKS OF CIGARETTES AND HONESTLY HOW MANY SMOKERS DO YOU KNOW WHO WILL TAKE A POTENTIAL UP TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FINE AMOUNT SERIOUSLY. AS I RECALL THE LANGUAGE FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN SMOKING BANS CONTAINED IN UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR FINE AMOUNT. THE REASON BEING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IS IN LINE WITH THE STATE LITERAL OP FINE WHICH IS ACCEPTED IS COMPLETELY REASONABLE. THE SECOND PROBLEM WITH AB ONE SEVEN ONE EIGHT IS THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM EXEMPTION. DEFINING A GOOD FAITH PRACTICE OF A RELIGIOUS BELIEF LEGALLY IS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO. A GOOD FAITH PRACTICE OF A RELIGIOUS BELIEF IS FAR TOO SUBJECTIVE AND ONLY CREATES A MASSIVE LOOPHOLE THERE IS NO SMOKING BAN IN THE ENTIRE NATION WEAR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM COMES INTO PLAY. MY HOME COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES PASSED THE SMOKING BAN LAST MONTH FOR COUNTY BEACHES IN INLAND PARKS WITH NO RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS MADE. LASTLY BUT COST OF IMPLEMENTING A SMOKING BAN WILL BE AROUND TWO MILLION DOLLARS. PLEASE LET'S NOT WASTE OUR CALIFORNIA'S TAX CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS MONEY ON A LOT THAT IS INEFFECTIVE AN UNENFORCEABLE. AFTER HAVING SERVED AS A MILITARY POLICEMAN IN THE U. S. ARMY. I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE THAT LAWS RULES REGULATIONS THAT OFFER TOO MUCH WIGGLE ROOM FOR VIOLATORS TO ESCAPE FROM. THE AVERAGE PEACE OFFICER WILL SIMPLY FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON OTHER PRIORITIES. AB ONE SEVEN ONE EIGHT CONTINUES TO USE THE SAME FLIGHT FAILED GAME PLAN WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE WAS TO HOPEFULLY APPEASE JERRY BROWN BACK IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE YEAR IS NOW NEW PROSPECTS FOR GETTING GOOD THINGS DONE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I KNOW FULL WELL THAT YOU WANT TO PASS A STRONG INTELLIGENT ENFORCEABLE LAW THAT WILL GIVE OUR STATE PARKS THE PROTECTION THEY NEED. WHILE MAKING BEST USE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS TAX DOLLARS. THEREFORE I AM ASKING YOU TO DO THE SMART THING. TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND INSIST THAT PROPER CORRECTIONS BE MADE TO THIS WELL MEANING BILL BEFORE IT IS ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION -- BRING IT BACK TO THE OMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR ON THIS. AND WE'VE HAD THIS BILL BEFORE US A FEW TIMES NOW -- YES. DOCTOR CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR OF EVEN THOUGH I DO READ -- IMPEDE ANALYSIS -- OF FROM MY KANTAKOUZENOS POSE ABOUT THE I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THIS ONE ON THE BASIS OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE SO. IN THE CITY OF IRVINE WE OUT. DID THE VERY EXTENSIVE -- THE HEALTH IMPACT UPON THE SECONDARY SMOKING IT WAS SO AWFUL WHEN MEAN AND THAT WE ADOPTED THE NO SMOKING IN THE PUBLIC AREAS AN OPEN. ALL. A SPACE IN THIS WORKING VERY VERY WELL. EVEN THOUGH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MAY NOT BE ENOUGH -- TO BEGIN WITH I THINK THIS IS A GOOD DETERRENCE. ONCE -- THIS -- BANIAS IMPLEMENTED. RAISING THE FINE IF FOR TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS DOESN'T WORK IT WILL BE A LOT EASIER -- AND OUT ON THAT BASIS SO I THINK WE NEED -- TO THE VOTE ON THIS ONE TO BAN. SMOKING ON THE PUBLIC BEACHES SO -- HAD THE PICNIC AREAS -- BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTS TO OUR FEW PEOPLE WOULD RUIN AND TYLER. ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRESENT. IN THAT AREA AND A SECONDARY HOME. FOR IMPACT UPON HEALTH OF THIS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE SO THEREFORE IS NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL OR SO. I HAD BEEN A TO BE HONORED THE BUT THEY THE PUBLIC PLACES SUCH THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD NOT. BE ABLE -- TO SUPPORT TO WANT SOMEBODY SMOKES IN THE PUBLIC AREA. THANK YOU. HE DUCKED CHOI ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SIR TO GLAZE YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE AND THANK EACH YEAR GALLAGHER. LET ME JUST SUFFERS SAY THAT. DOCTOR CHOI THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THIS EFFORT THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH IS SECOND TO NONE AND WOULD APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE -- WORKED ON THIS TOGETHER FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW. LET ME ADDRESS A COUPLE THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. I IN REGARD TO THE AMOUNT. YOU KNOW AS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA UNIFORM BEILIN PENALTY SCHEDULE CREATES A A SERIES OF FIVE ADDITIONAL COSTS TO A TECH AND NOT JUST THE FACE VALUE. OUR DETERMINATION IS THAT THE COST OF A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR SMOKING VIOLATION WOULD. BE CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL COSTS I WOULD NOTE THAT AT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ADJUST IN FUTURE YEARS IF WE FIND THAT THE FINE IS A SIGNIFICANT UP ISSUE THAT WE WANT. TO MAKE IT HIGHER -- IN REGARD TO THE RELIGIOUS BELIEF. WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR A PARK RANGERS THEY HAVE DIFFICULT JOBS -- AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE MORE DIFFICULT. BUT THEY ENJOY A LOT OF DISCRETION IN THE CHOICES THEY MAKE IN THE FIELD. AND I THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE GOOD JUDGMENTS ABOUT WHETHER SOMEONE IS PRACTICING -- IN A RELIGIOUS BELIEF FOR CEREMONY -- AS THE BILL SPECIFIES OR NOT. AND IF THERE'S A DISPUTE ON THAT THAT THE COURTS WILL ULTIMATELY DETERMINE WHETHER THAT THAT WAS BEING DONE APPROPRIATELY -- MEMBERS WE'VE WORKED ON THIS BILL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I THINK PEOPLE ARE PRETTY SET IN THEIR VIEWS ABOUT IT. BUT I THINK FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVIN'S POINT OF VIEW. PUBLIC HEALTH -- THE SAFETY OF OUR FORESTS AND PARKS -- IT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STATE TO HAVE AS A MY WITNESS INDICATED A UNIFORM POLICY ACROSS THE BOARD. I THINK IT'S A HEALTHY ONE FOR FOR PEOPLE AND AND FOR WILDLIFE AND FOR OUR OUR STATE WITH THAT I ASKED HERE I PUT. THANK YOU SENATOR -- THIS DOESN'T DO IT DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR. I PERSONALLY AS AS A HAVE IN THE PAST WILL BE IN OPPOSE -- BUT IT DOES SEVENTY PASSENGERS SO MADAM CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
