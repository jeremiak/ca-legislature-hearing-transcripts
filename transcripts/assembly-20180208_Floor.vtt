01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.510 region:rollup2
THE LIFETIME OF ANYBODY IN THIS

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:03.780 region:rollup2
ROOM.

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:05.148 region:rollup2
IT'S A PHASE IT OUT PROCESS.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.416 region:rollup2
YOU JUST NEED TO LOOK AT THEIR

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:08.217 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IN THIS ROOM TO CHECK

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:09.552 region:rollup2
PROBABLY FOR THE TABLES IN HERE

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:11.888 region:rollup2
HAS SOME SORT OF PLASTIC AND IT.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:13.423 region:rollup2
IT COMES FROM MORRELL.

01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:16.059 region:rollup2
A CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:17.994 region:rollup2
A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE WHO MANAGES

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:20.029 region:rollup2
RESOURCE IN A VERY RESPONSIBLE

01:08:17.994 --> 01:08:20.630 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.265 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE WHAT THEY'RE

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:25.768 region:rollup2
DOING.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:27.437 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE TRADE OFF.

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:28.638 region:rollup2
IS FAR IS CHALLENGING WHAT'S

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:30.606 region:rollup2
REALLY BEAUTIFUL ABOUT

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:33.810 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN RAISED IN A

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:35.979 region:rollup2
COASTAL COMMUNITY REDONDO BEACH.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:37.614 region:rollup2
AND NOW REPRESENTING NORTH COAST

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:39.115 region:rollup2
OF SAN DIEGO.

01:08:37.614 --> 01:08:40.016 region:rollup2
OUR BEACHES ARE UNIQUE TO THE

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.918 region:rollup2
WORLD AND WE NEED TO PROTECT

01:08:40.016 --> 01:08:43.119 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:08:41.918 --> 01:08:44.754 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M

01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:46.122 region:rollup2
AGAINST OIL I'M NOT AGAINST ALL

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:47.991 region:rollup2
AYE THIEVES THERE'S A PLACE FOR

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:50.526 region:rollup2
IT WE'RE GONNA PHASE THAT OUT.

01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:52.729 region:rollup2
BUT I AM FOR THE HISTORY IN THE

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:54.030 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:55.965 region:rollup2
BEACHES AND FOR THAT REASON I

01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:56.766 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THAT WE NOT DO THIS.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.801 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

01:08:56.766 --> 01:09:00.570 region:rollup2
THE SECOND ISSUE I WOULD LAY

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:03.239 region:rollup2
OUT TOO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:04.107 region:rollup2
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:07.143 region:rollup2
I SEE THIS IS A STATES RIGHTS

01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:09.112 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.980 region:rollup2
WE AS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:13.116 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO STAND UP AGAINST

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:13.716 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:15.084 region:rollup2
DECIDING WHAT OUR ENVIRONMENTS

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.552 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:17.587 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I FIND IT OF OUR PARTY

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:18.855 region:rollup2
WAS ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:20.623 region:rollup2
STATE'S RIGHTS STANDING UP TO

01:09:18.855 --> 01:09:22.125 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:23.626 region:rollup2
I WANT TO BELIEVES FEDERAL

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:25.128 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BASS WHEN IT'S.

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:26.996 region:rollup2
SMALLER AND FOCUSED ON THEIR

01:09:25.128 --> 01:09:27.997 region:rollup2
MISSION. AND I WOULD SAY THE

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:30.667 region:rollup2
MISSION OF THE FEDERAL

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:32.402 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO DEFINING.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:34.303 region:rollup2
THE ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:36.606 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:38.775 region:rollup2
I RECOMMENDED WE VOTE IN SUPPORT

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:40.576 region:rollup2
OF AJ ARE TWENTY NINE.

01:09:38.775 --> 01:09:41.377 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:43.680 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOU'RE

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:44.814 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:49.352 region:rollup2
SPEAKER AND MEMBERS.

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.786 region:rollup2
LIKE I'VE SAID BEFORE.

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:52.455 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THESE

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:52.955 region:rollup2
RESOLUTIONS.

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:54.257 region:rollup2
CONGRESS AND THE FEDERAL

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:55.391 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:09:54.257 --> 01:09:57.060 region:rollup2
ARE INDEED A WASTE OF TIME FOR

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:57.560 region:rollup2
THIS BODY.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.495 region:rollup2
AND I AND WORTHY OF OUR

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.464 region:rollup2
ATTENTION.

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:02.398 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO COMMENT.

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:03.666 region:rollup2
SPEND YOUR TIME DEBATING ON

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:06.436 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ISSUES.

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:07.570 region:rollup2
RUN FOR CONGRESS.

01:10:06.436 --> 01:10:10.740 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE IT CAN BE

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:12.708 region:rollup2
DONE AGAIN.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:14.043 region:rollup2
BONDING OUR TIME.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.445 region:rollup2
WITH THE NON BINDING RESOLUTION

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:17.113 region:rollup2
ON CONGRESS I BELIEVE IS A WASTE

01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:18.548 region:rollup2
OF TIME.

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:20.850 region:rollup2
AND LIKE RESOLUTIONS BEFORE THE

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:22.785 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:24.987 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL THAT YOU.

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:26.989 region:rollup2
AS MEMBERS OF THIS BODY.

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:28.024 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT TAKEN THE TIME TO CALL

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:29.625 region:rollup2
YOUR OVERLAPPING MEMBERS OF

01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:30.093 region:rollup2
CONGRESS.

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:32.729 region:rollup2
BEFORE VOTING ON THIS

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:35.998 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:37.100 region:rollup2
IT'S A KIND OF SLACKTIVISM.

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:39.068 region:rollup2
YOU JUST SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:40.403 region:rollup2
TIME HERE. RATHER THAN DOING THE

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:42.338 region:rollup2
REAL WORK.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:46.008 region:rollup2
I'M COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:47.410 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF CONGRESS DIRECTLY.

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:48.644 region:rollup2
IS THAT BECAUSE THAT YOU THINK

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:51.414 region:rollup2
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME OR THIS

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:52.782 region:rollup2
ISSUE ISN'T WORTH YOUR TIME.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:54.984 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE WITH

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:56.419 region:rollup2
YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.954 region:rollup2
OR IS IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.988 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T DEVELOPED A GOOD ENOUGH

01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:00.423 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR MEMBER OF

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:01.357 region:rollup2
CONGRESS.

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:06.496 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY RETURN YOUR

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:09.398 region:rollup2
CALL.

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:12.335 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS A THREE MILE

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:15.905 region:rollup2
LIMIT OF JURISDICTION.

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:17.774 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW. ONLY HAS CONTROL

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:19.842 region:rollup2
OVER BEYOND THOSE THREE MILES IF

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:21.778 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A DEBATE OF WHAT TO DO

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:23.713 region:rollup2
WITHIN OUR THREE MILE LIMIT.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:24.647 region:rollup2
THEN ABSOLUTELY THIS IS WITHIN

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:26.649 region:rollup2
OUR JURISDICTION AND WORTHY OF

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:27.984 region:rollup2
OUR TIME.

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:30.586 region:rollup2
I UP TO SUCH PLATFORMS IN MY

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:32.722 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:34.056 region:rollup2
BUT THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T ABOUT

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:37.827 region:rollup2
WHAT'S WITHIN THE JURISDICTION

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:39.395 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:41.164 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:42.865 region:rollup2
A RIDICULOUS WASTE OF TIME.

01:11:41.164 --> 01:11:44.200 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:45.201 region:rollup2
US TO GET TO THE REAL ISSUES

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:49.172 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE FACING ON THE

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:50.806 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE DOCKET.

01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:52.575 region:rollup2
BANNING PLASTIC STRAWS OR HAVING

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:53.876 region:rollup2
A SUGAR TAX I GUESS

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:55.144 region:rollup2
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE THOSE

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:56.546 region:rollup2
ARE BAD EXAMPLES TO BE ABLE TO

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.747 region:rollup2
USE.

01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:59.782 region:rollup2
MAYBE IF THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:00.750 region:rollup2
USING OUR TIME FOR THOSE ARE

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:02.451 region:rollup2
GOOD ARGUMENTS FOR A PART TIME

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:04.453 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:05.254 region:rollup2
WITH PART TIME PAY.

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:08.491 region:rollup2
I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THIS

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:10.393 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:11.427 region:rollup2
OKAY THINK CLEAR.

01:12:10.393 --> 01:12:16.966 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALLEN YOU ARE

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:18.935 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CALIFORNIA

01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:23.573 region:rollup2
IMPORTS OVER SIXTY FIVE PERCENT

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:25.575 region:rollup2
OF OUR OIL AND GAS NEEDS.

01:12:23.573 --> 01:12:27.310 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:29.445 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS MORE THEN OF OIL

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.780 region:rollup2
AND GAS FOR OUR ENTIRE STATE FOR

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.615 region:rollup2
TODAY AND FOR GENERATIONS TO

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:34.550 region:rollup2
COME.

01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:37.386 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FURTHERMORE HAS SHUT

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:38.654 region:rollup2
DOWN ELEVEN REFINERIES SINCE

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:41.090 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY REDUCING OUR

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:42.725 region:rollup2
CAPACITY FOR PRODUCTION. BY OVER

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:44.961 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:46.195 region:rollup2
GALLONS PER DAY.

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:47.930 region:rollup2
WITH NOW AMONG THE NATION'S

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:49.298 region:rollup2
HIGHEST GAS PRICES

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:51.868 region:rollup2
WOULD NOW AMONG THE NATION'S

THAT SEEM TO COME OUT DALY OUT

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:57.740 region:rollup2
OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT RUN

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:59.542 region:rollup2
BODY THAT WE STAND AND RIGHT NOW

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:01.444 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. THE

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:03.145 region:rollup2
LAST THING WE NEED TO DO IS BE

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:06.048 region:rollup2
TELLING CALIFORNIANS THAT THEY

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:08.851 region:rollup2
CAN'T ACCESS THEIR OWN OIL AND

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:11.354 region:rollup2
GAS THAT BELONGS TO THEM. LET'S

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:12.922 region:rollup2
BE VERY CLEAR. THIS OIL AND GAS

01:13:11.354 --> 01:13:14.824 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA DOES NOT BELONG TO

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:16.993 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATURE IT DOES NOT

01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:19.328 region:rollup2
BELONG TO ANY OF THE MEMBERS IN

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:20.363 region:rollup2
THIS ROOM ANYMORE THAN IT DOES

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:22.331 region:rollup2
TO THE THIRTY NINE MILLION

01:13:20.363 --> 01:13:24.634 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS. THAT DEPEND UPON

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:26.068 region:rollup2
ENERGY FOR ALL THEIR DAILY NEEDS

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:28.037 region:rollup2
TO DRIVE BACK AND FORTH TO WORK

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.571 region:rollup2
TO USE OUR AIR CONDITIONER TO

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:30.239 region:rollup2
KEEP THEIR FOOD CALLED THE

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:31.974 region:rollup2
REFRIGERATOR.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:34.944 region:rollup2
NGUYEN.

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:36.379 region:rollup2
SOLAR NUCLEAR ALL OF THESE OTHER

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:38.581 region:rollup2
ENERGY OPTIONS.

01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:40.750 region:rollup2
OUR GREAT.

01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:43.019 region:rollup2
BUT THEY PALE IN COMPARISON

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:45.221 region:rollup2
TO WHAT WE ACTUALLY USE.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:45.755 region:rollup2
IN OIL AND GAS THERE'S NO REASON

01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:47.189 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:48.724 region:rollup2
IMPORTING.

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:50.192 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF OUR

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:51.927 region:rollup2
ENERGY NEEDS EVERY SINGLE YEAR

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:53.596 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE PLENTY IN THE

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:56.666 region:rollup2
GROUND RIGHT BELOW US.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:57.934 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE STOP.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:59.235 region:rollup2
MEASURES LIKE THIS THAT MAKE

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:01.337 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE AND ARE AN

01:13:59.235 --> 01:14:03.406 region:rollup2
INJUSTICE TO THE THIRTY NINE
