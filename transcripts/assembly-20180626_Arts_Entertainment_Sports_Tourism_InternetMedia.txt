WILL HAVE TO BE A SUBCOMMITTEE STARTED [inaudible] SENATOR PARA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] SHARE MEMBER. I'M HERE TO PRESENT -- SP. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR THE BILL THAT DIRECTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ESTABLISH AN ADVISER WHO STUDY THE PROBLEM TO SPREAD A FALSE INFORMATION THROUGH INTERFACE INTERNET BASED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. THE DRAFT THE MODELS OF TEACHING PLAN FOR SUCH PLATFORMS MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION PLATFORMS. I DO STE SP FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE WE HAVE A CLEAR ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION. CERTAINLY IN OUR SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD -- NOW WE SEE FIRST ABOUT -- THE EARTH IS FLAT THEN. SO FOR THAT NAY SEEMS A BIT AMUSING BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS GOT MORE SERIOUS SIDE YOU HAVE -- DISSEMINATION OF THE HOLOCAUST DENIAL DENIALS. SHOOTINGS THAT HAPPENED AT SANDY HOOK AND PARK LAND WHICH ALSO RESULTED NOT ONLY JUST YOU KNOW COST INFORMATION BUT LED. TO INTIMIDATION AND THREATS -- AND THEN WE EVEN MORE SERIOUSLY PRONE TO MANIPULATION SO FOR EXAMPLE SIDE. AND YOU SAID IT WAS ACTUALLY THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA -- UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY SAYS DIVISIONS -- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT AND MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN SCIENCE MAGAZINE REPORTED THAT IN INVESTIGATING THE DIFFERENCE OF THE FUSION OF ALL VERIFY TRUE AND FALSE NEWS CHOICE SHOULD. BETTER BETWEEN 200-062-00017 THAT FALSEHOODS IF YOU SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER FARTHER AND DEEPER. AND MORE BROADLY THE TRUTH IN ALL CHARACTERS INFORMATION IN FACT THEY NOTED THAT -- FALSE INFORMATION ACT TO BE TWICE AS FAR. AS THAT CHIU INFORMATION. AND SAID SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES ARE PLATFORMS FALSE INFORMATION SPREADS ITS CAN BECOME MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. I KNOW THAT SEVERAL COMPANIES ARE REALLY TRYING TO COME UP WITH PLANTS THE DELEGATE THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW WHAT THOSE PLANS ARE AND HOW THE WORKING. AND AS A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES -- TO LET US KNOW IF THEY HAVE. PLANS ABOUT THOSE CLAIMS ARE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE SPREAD. COULD BE A WORK GROUP TO STUDY RESEARCH PLAN MILES. STEPPED WORKING TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION I HOPE WE CAN BETTER PROTECT THE PUBLIC. HARM THAT CAN BE CAUSED BY. BY THESE FALSE STORIES I WOULD MAKE YOU KNOW THAT. WHAT WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT CERTAINLY WE UNDERSTAND? THAT PEOPLE THE FIRST. RIGHT TO POST WHICH UP WHATEVER THEY WANT. AND THAT IT CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT IN ANY WAY. TO LIMIT THE ABILITY PEOPLE TO POST THINGS ON SOCIAL BE A BAD THING AT THE END OF THREE NEVER EARLIER INNOVATION THAT DEL TERMS OF QUIETLY YOU CAN'T THIS WORKING GROUP -- WE EVEN HAD CHALLENGES TRYING TO JUST COME OF THE DEFINITION OF WHAT SOCIAL MEDIA WAS IN LEGAL TERMS. OKAY AND EXACTLY WHAT WOULD FALL UNDER THAT AND WEBER. I THINK SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE. I WORKED OUT WITH VERY STAKEHOLDERS IS VIA A WAY TO APPROACH THAT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING SEARCH TECHNOLOGY -- SO WE INSERT THE REGULAR MEDIA THERE ARE MECHANISMS BOB IN PLACE TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WHILE STILL ALLOWING FIRST AMENDMENTS. RIGHTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO BE SURE WE PROTECT FIRST AMENDMENT SPEECH RIGHTS BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO TECHNOLOGY THAT -- THAT. THAT IS DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY -- TO IN THE WAYS THAT CAN BE HARMFUL TO OUR SOCIETY THAT THAT DAY GO TO TERMS OF DISSEMINATION SO. THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE EXAMINED QUARTERLY TO PROTECT IF MARKETS SEE THAT'S WHAT THIS CALL'S ABOUT APPRECIATE. PASSWORD I GREAT -- VOTE TAKE A MOTION WHO DO HAVE A QUORUM NOW.

KANSEN CHU AYE KANSEN CHU AYE WALDRON [inaudible] ACOSTA. THE CONCERT NINE DAVID CHIU. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I KAMLAGER-DOVE MS ARYAN. OR I WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THINKING VERY MUCH YOU. FLORIDA A HERTZBERG MORE HERTZBERG [inaudible] HERTZBERG. HOUSE FOR IT [inaudible] OKAY AREA [inaudible] GO. SENATOR HERTZBERG IS PRETENDING SP ONE ZERO THEIR WATCHED THEY CAN [inaudible] THERE'S HARMONY AND THAT NAME ITS ONES AND ZEROS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT ONES AND ZEROS. BECAUSE ONE'S AND ZEROS ARE CHANGE IN THE WORLD ONES AND ZEROS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THIS AREA THIS IS ABOUT BOTS. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BASICALLY IN A NUTSHELL WITH THIS BILL IS TO HAVE TRUTH. IN HOW THE INTERNET IS USED TO CREATE DECEPTION. WHETHER IT'S IN THE AREA OF POLITICS JUST HAPPEN TO BE IN MY ALEXIAN THIS VERY LAST TIME IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. WE SEE IT IN BUSINESSES WHERE COMPANIES ARE SAYING THEY'VE GOT SO MANY FOLLOWERS. AND WE SEE THAT WERE CELEBRITIES COME IN AND GO HIGHER COMPANIES. WE DON'T WANT NO I KNOW THERE'S A QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED APPROPRIATELY SO MORE SENSITIVE TO WHAT ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES IN THE ANALYSIS. THE ISSUE IS NOT WHAT TO BE SAID BUT THAT PEOPLE THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO FAKE IT. WHEN YOU TRY TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU'RE TALKING TO A HUMAN BEING? YOU'RE DOING THAT TO DECEIVE SOMEBODY NOT IN THE NATURE OF YOUR MESSAGE BUT WHO IS THE MESSENGER. AND SO THIS BOTS BILL IS TO US IS A BIG DEAL WITH COMMON SENSE TO SPONSOR WILL DO LET THEM TALK IN A MINUTE. BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF JUST DISCLOSURE THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN SOME REASONABLE METHODS OF ENFORCEMENT. SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS IT'S KANSEN CHU ON THE LINE IT'S NOT REALLY YOU ITS JUST A NOTIFICATION THAT IF SOMEBODY SAYS THAT THERE YOU COULD BE BOOK. LAST POINT I'LL MAKE. FUNDAMENTAL THE CONSTITUTION IS ANONYMITY. THE FEDERALIST PAPERS THE FOLKS THAT WROTE THAT THEY DID HAVE THEIR NAMES ON IT THOMAS PAINE DIDN'T NAMES ON COMMON SENSE THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. BUT WE KNEW IT WAS SOME HUMAN BEING. THAT WAS BEHIND IT RATHER THAN SOME. KNOWLEDGE THE IN A DECEPTIVE WAY AND UNDER THE LAW THERE'S A BASIC CONT THERE'S A BASIC RIGHT THAT IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH. AND THAT IS THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT TEND NOT TO FRAUD TO BE FREE OF THE FRAUD. IS ALL THROUGHOUT THE LAW IS A CRIME AGAINST FRAUD THAT'S ALL WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET JUST SAY WHAT YOU WANT. WE DON'T CARE JUST LET US KNOW THAT IT'S DONE THROUGH A COMPUTER -- WHO'S TRYING TO IMPERSONATE A HUMAN BEING ASK YOUR SUPPORT. ASSEMBLYMEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND FOR LETTING ME BRIEFLY ADDRESS YOU MY NAME'S SEAN PRESTON AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT JUSTICE A LIFELONG HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST AND NOW A SENIOR ADVISER TO COMMONSENSE MEDIA. WHY DOES THE KIDS ORGANIZATION CARE ABOUT POTS HE WOULD QUITE REASONABLY ASKING YOURSELF? AND THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE EVERY PARENT WANTS TO LEAVE A BETTER OFF WORLD FOR THEIR KIDS THAN THEY FOUND THEN THEY CAME INTO THEM. AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT BOTS THAT MAKES ME VERY WORRIED THAT WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. ON IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE ALL GONE ON A ON A LEARNING JOURNEY ABOUT WHAT BOTS ARE AND HOW THIS USE OF FRAUDULENT. AUTOMATED ACCOUNTS ONLINE CAN BE USED TO MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION. AND THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT I WANT TO BRING UP THAT ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS ONE IN EVERY HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION AROUND THE WORLD EVERY MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION. POTS OF BEING USED BY AUTHORITIES IN POWER TO OPPRESS THEIR PEOPLE POLITICAL ACTIVISTS IN CAMBODIA ARE BEING TRACKED DOWN BY BOTS. JOURNALISTS IN KENYA ARE BEING TRACKED DOWN BY BOUGHT SOMETHING IT'S POISONING PUBLIC DISCOURSE IN AFRICA IN MEXICO HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE BEING. TRACKED DOWN AND TARGETED BY BUT SOMETIMES BOUGHT NETWORKS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAKE ACCOUNTS THAT WILL BE TARGETED TOWARDS ONE SMALL GRASSROOTS. ACTIVIST SO THAT'S THE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE'RE ALL VERY AWARE OF IS THE ELECTION HACKING ISSUE I WISH I COULD SAY THAT WERE BEHIND US IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR UNITED STATES DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DANIEL COATS. ADDRESSED THE U. S. CONGRESS AND SAID IT IS ONGOING ANY SAID SPECIFICALLY IT'S FAKE NEWS AND THOUGHTS THAT ARE BEING USED TO ATTACK ELECTIONS. A RESEARCHER FROM THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR AT THE DITCH INTEL LAB AT THE INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE PAL WHAT DOMAIN NAME SAMUEL WILLIE. WHO STUDIES THE SAYS THAT IN ALMOST? TODAY YOU CAN SEE BOTS ATTEMPTING TO MANIPULATE THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE -- SO WE HAVE THIS HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS WE HAVE THESE ELECTION PROBLEMS BOTH OF WHICH ARE VARIOUS VERY SERIOUS. NOW A LIBERTARIAN VIEWPOINT MIGHT LOOK AT THIS AND SAY -- AN ARGUMENT SIMILAR TO GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE AND THAT'S A SEMANTIC ARGUMENT MAY BE TRUE OR NOT BUT WHAT IS TRUE IS WE NEED A STRONG WEB OF REGULATIONS. AROUND GUN CONTROL WE NEED STRONG GUN REGULATIONS THAT SOMETHING THE STATE VERY CLEARLY BELIEVES THAT. SIMILARLY BOTS ARE BEING USED TO KILL PEOPLE AND ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY NEED STRONG REGULATIONS IT'S NOT GONNA COME OUT OF CONGRESS HAS A COMMITTED THE TECH INDUSTRIES. AND I HOPE THAT YOU ALL WILL JOIN IN THAT EFFORT. THANK YOU AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT WOULD ASSIST IN SUPPORT. BUT HE'S TRYING TO FIX A MICROPHONE LA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OR ANY OPPOSITION [inaudible] WILL READ [inaudible] GOSH OPPOSITION.
