EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTED OFFICIALS LOOK MORE AND MORE LIKE THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. THIS YEAR. THERE ARE MORE. THERE ARE MORE WOMEN. AND MORE PARENTS WITH SMALL KIDS AND BIG IDEAS. CHANGE IS IN THE AIR ALONG WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION. OF WHAT WE WILL DO TOGETHER TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. OVER THE PAST TWENTY MONTHS I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. ASKING QUESTIONS AND LISTENING TO PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. WE KNOW THAT SINCE THE END OF THE GREAT RECESSION CALIFORNIA HAS REBOUNDED TO BECOME THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. EMPLOYMENT IS AT A RECORD LOW GDP GROWTH IS OUT PACING MOST OF THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET SURPLUS. BUT TRAVELED THE STATE I MET MANY FAMILIES WHO ARE STILL OUT THERE STRIVING TO REBUILD THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY. AND REGAIN WHAT THEY LOST DURING THE RECESSION. I WAS INSPIRED BY A PROFOUND SENSE NOT OF EXASPERATION BUT OF HOPE. AND EXPECTATION OF HOPE THAT IS CALIFORNIA'S DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WE HEAR THEM. AND AN EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL TO KEEP THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ALIVE FOR EVERYONE. CALIFORNIANS ARE LOOKING TO ALL OF US AND ESPECIALLY TO OUR NEWLY ELECTED GOVERNOR AND FIRST PARTNER. YOUR BOLD LEADERSHIP IN JUST THESE FIRST WEEKS HAS ALREADY AFFECTED THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE ON ISSUES LIKE BORDER SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. AND YOUR FIRST PROPOSED BUDGET UNDERSCORES A COMMITMENT TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY A COMMITMENT TO OUR CHILDREN. OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR WORLD RENOWNED SYSTEM OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AND SO MUCH MORE. WHICH IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY FOR YOUR VERY FIRST STATE OF THIS DAY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT IS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE THE FORTIETH GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA PLEASE STAND FOR GOVERNOR GAVIN OVER UNDER. SOMEONE SAID TWO HOURS OR ONE I SAID IN A BIG ONE WE'RE GONNA BE ALRIGHT BUT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU. FOR THE GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT I WANT TO THANK. MISTER SPEAKER YOU IN PARTICULAR -- FOR BEING A CHAMPION NOT ONLY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT BEAN -- AN EXTRAORDINARY COURAGEOUS LEADER AND AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR GENEROSITY OF WELCOMING MYSELF AND MY WIFE. INTO YOUR HOUSE TO DATA. THAT A PRO TEM THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COMMITMENT. TO PERHAPS MORE ANYTHING ELSE COLLABORATION WHAT I THINK IS REALLY HELP MAKE THIS FIRST MONTH TOGETHER -- SO REMARKABLY PRODUCTIVE -- AND IT IS A NICE THING TO SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. I GET TO SAY IN THIS CHAMBER THANK YOU MADAM LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOR THAT INTERACTION -- WHAT? WITH. THE KNOWLEDGE THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. TO YOU KNOW. SOMEONE IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE WE GOTTA REMEMBER OUR OUR STATUS. AND ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY ON THE LEGISLATORS AND ALL THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT -- I SEE UP THERE THEY TRAVEL ACROSS THE STATE TO BE HERE I'M A MEASURE OF THE GRATEFUL AND HUMBLE -- BY YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY AND IT JUST SO YOU'RE. REASSURED DO NOT WORRY DUTCH IS NOT HERE TODAY -- WE OULD CLEARLY LEARNED OUR LESSON FROM THE INAUGURAL I I KNOW. YEAH YOU'RE GONNA BE STUCK HAVING TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME THIS TIME -- SO. I KNOW NOT. BUT I PLEDGE TO DEFEND THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. AND TODAY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO THAT TOGETHER. LOOK BY EVERY TRADITIONAL MEASURE YOU JUST HEARD THAT THE STATE OF OUR STATE IS STRONG. WE HAVE THAT RECORD BREAKING SURPLUS WE'VE ADDED OVER THREE MILLION JOBS SINCE THE DEATH OF THE RECESSION WE'RE SEEING WAGES RISING. WHEN A STATE WITH MORE SCIENTISTS MORE ENGINEERS MORE NOBEL LAUREATES MORE VENTURE CAPITAL MORE PATENTS EMANATING THAN ANY OTHER PART? OF THIS COUNTRY AND WE OF COURSE HAVE THE FINEST. SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. BUT A ALONG WITH THAT PROSPERITY AND PROGRESS THERE ARE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED TOO LONG. AND THAT TRIED TO PUT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM OUT OF REACH FOR TOO MANY. BUT WE FACE HARD DECISIONS THAT ARE COMING DUE. AND THE CHOICES WE MAKE WILL SHAPE OUR FUTURE AND THE FUTURE QUITE LITERALLY MILLIONS FOR DECADES TO COME AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY AS FRANKLY. AND IS DIRECTLY AS I CAN THE TOUGH CALLS WE MUST MAKE TOGETHER. ISSUES LIKE RAIL ON WATER. AND ENERGY. HOW WE PROTECT OUR MIGRANTS HOW WE CARE FOR OUR SENIORS HOW WE HELP ARE HOMELESS? AND HOW ABOVE ALL ELSE WE TACKLE I SAYS THAT IS COMING TO THE FIND LIFE IN THE STATE. I WON'T PRETEND TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT THE ONLY WAY TO FIND THEM IS. TO I THINK FACE THESE ISSUES HONEST [inaudible] LET'S START. LET'S START WITH SOME OF THE FEAR MONGERING. THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THIS. QUOTE UNQUOTE SO CALLED BORDER EMERGENCY -- FOR ME. FOR ME THIS IS AN ECHO FROM FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS IN A NEW MAYOR. SITTING IN THE GALLERY AT THE STATE OF THE UNION. AND WASHING WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH SAID THAT THE LGBT AMERICANS COULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED. WAS AN ATTACK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ON OUR FRIENDS OUR NEIGHBORS AND ON CALIFORNIA VALUES. I WAS SO PROUD TO WATCH BRAVE CALIFORNIANS ANSWER THOSE ATTACKS WITH LOVE AND COURAGE. PHYLLIS LINE IN DEL MARTIN MADE HISTORY WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO TO THIS VERY DAY. SO NOW JUST LIKE BACK THEN. WE MUST STAND UP FOR THOSE THAT ARE MALIGN. MARGINALIZED AND SCAPEGOAT. BECAUSE LAST WEEK. WE HEARD ANOTHER PRESIDENT STAND UP OF THE STATE OF THE UNION AN OFFER A VISION OF AMERICA FUNDAMENTALLY. AT ODDS WITH CALIFORNIA VALUES. IT DESCRIBES A COUNTRY WHERE INEQUALITY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM. WORK CLIMATE CHANGE THEN EXIST. AND WHERE THE GREATEST THREAT WE FACE COMES FROM SEEKING ASYLUM AT THE BORDER. IT JUST LAST NIGHT DOWN IN EL PASO. HE SAID IT ALL AGAIN. SO LET'S JUST STATE THE FACTS WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING THE LOWEST NUMBER OF BORDER CROSSING SINCE NINETEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE CALIFORNIA LIKE OUR NATION ARE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL. IN MORE THAN A DECADE. SOME FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FEWER IN OUR STATE ALONE. IMMIGRANTS BOTH HERE LEGALLY. AND THOSE WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION COMMIT CRIMES AT A LOWER RATE THAN NATIVE BORN CITIZENS. AND THOSE FAMILIES. IN THOSE FAMILIES THOSE WOMEN AND CHILDREN SEEKING ASYLUM AT THE BORDERS ARE DOING SO LEGAL. THOSE ARE THE FACTS THIS BORDER EMERGENCY IS NOTHING MORE THAN A MANUFACTURED CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE PART OF THIS POLITICAL THEATER JUST YESTERDAY I I I SENT A NEW DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. PUT THEM ON A NEW MISSION ONE THAT'S GONNA FOCUS ON RESPECTFULLY THE REAL THREATS FACING OUR STATE. AND NOW DIRECTOR THE NATIONAL GUARD THIRD OF THE FORCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY THE BORDER TO BE REDEPLOYED TO HELP PREPARE FOR THE UPCOMING FIRE SEASON BY JOINING CAL FIRE AND PREVENTION. AND SUPPRESSION WORK WORK BY RIGHT BY THE WAY. IRONICALLY THAT WAS CURTAILED DURING THE RECENT SUTTER. ANOTHER THIRD. WILL BOOST THE NATIONAL GUARD STATEWIDE COUNTER DRUG TASK FORCE BY REDEPLOYING UP NORTH TO GO AFTER ALL THESE ILLEGAL CANNABIS FARMS MANY OF WHICH ARE RUN BY THE CARTELS. THAT ARE DEVASTATING ARE PRISTINE FORESTS AND INCREASINGLY THEMSELVES BECOMING FIRE HAZARDS. AND THE REMAINING THIRD OF OUR GUARD. WE DIRECTED TO TO FOCUS ON STOPPING SMUGGLING DRUGS AND GUNS THROUGH EXISTING BORDER CHECKPOINTS. THE WALL THAT STRETCHES THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES THROUGH WILDERNESS WILL DO NOTHING TO STOP THIS STRUCK THIS THREAT. SO THE ANSWER THE WHITE HOUSE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. NO MORE DIVISION NO MORE XENA PHOBIA. NO MORE NATIVISM WE SUFFERED ENOUGH OF THAT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WITH PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY SEVEN AND PROPOSITION TWO NEXT A LET'S LET LET'S -- AS LEVEL ABOUT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. YOU HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S. VISION I SHARE THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AND QUALITY OF LIFE DEPEND ON IMPROVING TRANSPORTATION. BUT LET'S BE REAL. PROJECT AS PLANNED WOULD COST TOO MUCH. RESPECTFULLY TAKE TOO LONG. THERE'S BEEN TOO LITTLE OVERSIGHT. AND NOT ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY. RIGHT NOW THERE SIMPLY ISN'T A PATH TO GET FROM SACRAMENTO TO SAN DIEGO LET ALONE FROM. SAN FRANCISCO TO LA. I WISH THERE WERE [inaudible] HOWEVER [inaudible] HE WE DO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO COMPLETE A HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD NOW I KNOW. I KNOW SOME CRITICS ARE GONNA SAY WELL THAT'S A TRAINED IN A WAY. BUT I THINK THAT'S WRONG. AND I THINK THAT'S OFFENSIVE. THE PEOPLE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN DURING THE WORST AIR POLLUTION IN AMERICA AND HAVE SOME OF THE LONGEST COMMUTES IN THIS STATE. AND THEY HAVE SUFFERED TOO MANY YEARS OF NEGLECT FROM POLICY MAKERS RESPECTFULLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THEY DESERVE BETTER. AND A HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT TO BE PART OF YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ANOTHER HIGH SPEED RAIL IS MORE THAN A TRAIN PROJECT. IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IT'S ABOUT UNLOCKING THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF THE VALLEY. NO WE CAN ALIGN OUR ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES ANCHORED BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IN TO THEM WITH TOOLS LIKE OPPORTUNITIES ONS THAT COULD FORM THE BACKBONE OF THE RE INVIGORATED. CENTRAL VALLEY ECONOMY. MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD AND COMMUNITIES IN BETWEEN ARE MORE DYNAMIC THAN PEOPLE REALIZE THE VALLEY. WELL. THE VALLEY MAY BE KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD [inaudible] FOR AGRICULTURE. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER STORY. READY TO BE TOLD A STORY OF A REGION HUNGRY FOR INVESTMENT A WORK FORCE EAGER FOR MORE TRAINING AND GOOD JOBS CALIFORNIANS THAT DESERVE A FAIR SHARE OF OUR STATES PROSPERITY. LOOK. WILL CONTINUE. TO SUPPORT OUR REGIONAL PROJECTS NORTH AND SOUTH. WE'LL FINISH PHASE ONE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. WILL CONNECT THE REVITALIZED CENTRAL VALLEY TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR FOR MORE FEDERAL FUNDING AND PRIVATE DOLLARS. BUT LET'S GET SOMETHING DONE ONCE AND FOR ALL. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU. I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE THAT THAT JUST WANT TO THROW AWAY THIS. WHOLE PROJECT. SO TO GIVE UP ON THIS ALL IN THIS OFFER YOU THIS. ABANDONING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ENTIRELY MEANS WE WILL HAVE WASTED BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH NOTHING BUT BROKEN PROMISES PARTIALLY. FILLED COMMITMENTS AND LAWSUITS TO SHOW FOR AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SENDING BACK THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO THIS PROJECT TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THAT WOULD DO IT AT THAT FUNDAMENTALLY WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN. BUT WE JUST WALKED AWAY. BUT ALSO I'M NOT INTERESTED IN MAKING THE SAME ALL MISTAKES AND THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M ORDERING SOME NEW TRANSPARENCY MEASURES. GONNA HOLD CONTRACTORS. GONNA WHOLE CONSULTANTS ACCOUNTABLE HAVING TO EXPLAIN HOW TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT INCLUDING CHANGE ORDERS COST OVER RUNS AND EVEN TRAVEL EXPENSES WE'RE ALSO WERE ALSO GOING TO SEIZE OF GOVERNANCE CHANGES STARTING WITH MY MY PICK FOR THE NEXT CHAIR OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY LENNY MEN DOGS UP MY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR. ONE IS YOU KNOW IS IS RUNNING ECONOMIC A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND I THIS FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT. TRANSPORTATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GO HAND IN HAND SO. THAT'S A POSITION OUR HIGH SPEED RIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WATER. WE NEED A FRESH APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO MEETING CALIFORNIA'S MASSIVE WATER CHALLENGES. WITH A BIG STATE DIVERSE WATER NEEDS CITIES IN THAT THAT NEED CLEAN DRINKING WATER. FARMS IN THE IRRIGATION TO KEEP FEEDING THE WORLD FRAGILE ECOSYSTEMS THAT MUST BE PROTECTED. OUR WATER SUPPLIES BECOMING LESS RELIABLE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN OUR POPULATIONS GROWING. BECAUSE A STRONG ECONOMY. THAT MEANS A LOT OF DEMAND ON UNPREDICTABLE SUPPLY. THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS BUT LET ME BE AS DIRECT ABOUT WHERE I STAND AS I CAN'T. I DO NOT SUPPORT THE WATER FIX AS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED. MEETING I DO NOT SUPPORT THE TWIN TOWERS. WE CAN HOWEVER BUILD ON THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE. AND THAT'S WHY I DO SUPPORT. A C. THE STATUS QUO IS NOT AN OPTION. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR WATER SUPPLY FROM EARTHQUAKES FROM RISING SEA LEVELS WE NEED TO PRESERVE DELTA FISHERIES AND WE NEED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CITIES AND FARMS. WE HAVE GOT TO GET PAST IS ALL BINARIES LIKE FARMERS VERSUS ENVIRONMENTALISTS THE NORTH VERSUS SOUTH. OUR APPROACH CAN'T BE EITHER OR IT HAS TO BE YES AND CONVEYANCE AND EFFICIENCY. AND RECYCLING PROJECTS LIKE THE ONES WERE SEEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MET WATER DISTRICT. EXPANDING FLOOD PLAINS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY GROUNDWATER RECHARGE LIKE FARMERS ARE ALREADY DOING IN FRESNO COUNTY. A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO THE BUILDING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN MEETING LONG TERM DEMAND. IN TO HELP BRING THIS BALANCE. I'M APPOINTING A NEW CHAIR TO THE CALIFORNIA WATER BOARD LOS JOAQUIN ESCADA. IN HIS FIRST TASK. HIS FIRST TASK OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORT MUST BE TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE ON REAL AGREEMENTS TO SAVE THE SAT SACRAMENTO. SAN JOAQUIN BAY DELTA. WE MUST GET THIS DONE FOR THE RESILIENCE OF A MIGHTY RIVERS. FOR THE STABILITY OF OUR AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THAT DEPEND ON THIS WATER EVERYDAY. NOW LET'S TALK HONESTLY ABOUT CLEAN DRINKING WATER. AND THIS IS NOT ME TAKING A SIP AS A PROP -- BUT JUST THIS MORNING. JUST THIS MORNING MORE THAN A MILLION CALIFORNIANS WOKE UP WITHOUT CLEAN WATER BASIN LET ALONE DRINK. SOME SCHOOLS HAVE SHUT DOWN DRINKING FOUNTAINS DUE TO CONTAMINATION. SOME POOR COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE I RECENTLY VISITED IN STANISLAUS COUNTY ARE PAYING MORE FOR ON DRINKABLE WATER. THEN BEVERLY HILLS PAYS FOR PER ST THIS. PRISTINE WATER. WITH RESPECT THIS IS A MORAL DISGRACE AND IT'S A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF WATER SYSTEMS ACROSS THIS STATE CONTAMINATED BY LEAD. CONTAMINATED BY ARSENIC AND YOUR RANGE. IN SOLVING THIS CRISIS IT WILL DEMAND SUSTAINED FUNDING BUT MORE. NOTHING ELSE IT'S GONNA DEMAND POLITICAL WILL FROM EACH AND EVERYONE OF US [inaudible] LET'S. LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR ENERGY FUTURE. AND THE P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY. WE'RE ALL FRUSTRATED OR ANGRY IT'S HAD TO COME TO THIS BG DID NOT DO ENOUGH TO SECURE DATERS APPOINTMENT OR PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. MY ADMINISTRATION WILL WORK TO MAKE SURE P. GINNY UP HOLD ITS OBLIGATIONS. A CONVENE THE TEAM OF THE NATION'S BEST BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEYS AND AND FINANCIAL EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE ENERGY SECTOR. THEY WILL WORK WITH MY STRIKE TEAM TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY THAT WE WILL PRESENT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. WE WILL ENSURE CONTINUED ACCESS TO SAFE AFFORDABLE POWER. WE WILL SEEK JUSTICE FOR FIRE VICTIMS FAIRNESS FOR EMPLOYEES AND PROTECTION FOR RATEPAYERS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SAFETY AND WE WILL NEVER WAVER ON ACHIEVING THE NATION'S MOST AMBITIOUS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. BUT THE PROBLEMS WE FACE ARE FAR GREATER. THAN TEACHING. CLIMATE CHANGE IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON ALL OF OUR UTILITIES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NORTH AND SOUTH. EDISON AND SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC MOST RECENTLY HAD THEIR CREDIT RATINGS DOWN WITH. THIS PRESSURE COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE ENTIRE ENERGY MARKET IS EVOLVING FROM ROOFTOP SOLAR WIND GENERATION TO SMART GRID TECHNOLOGIES FROM COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS TO DIRECT ACCESS SERVICE. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ELECTRICITY NOW IS BEING PROCURED OUTSIDE OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE PRACTICES THAT WERE CREATED DECADES AGO THEY DID NOT ANTICIPATE THESE CHANGES. SO WE MUST MAP OUT A LONGER TERM FRAMEWORK NOT JUST FOR THE UTILITIES FUTURE BUT FOR CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE. TO ENSURE THAT THE COSTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE DOESN'T FALL ON THOSE LEAST ABLE TO AFFORD. I WANT -- TO BRIEFLY EDUCATION. THE TEACHER STRIKE IN LA IS OVER ABOUT THE NEED TO CONFRONT A TYLER UNDERLYING CAUSES OBVIOUSLY IS ONLY JUST BEGUN. UNDERSTAFFED SCHOOLS OVER CROWDED CLASSROOMS PENSION PRESSURES THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP GROWTH OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THE STRESSORS ARE SHOWING UP ALL OVER THE STATE. RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN FRESNO IN OAKLAND. DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE -- OUR CHALLENGE TO BALANCE BUDGETS EVEN IN THIS STRONG ECONOMY. THE TIME WE'RE SPENDING MORE ON SCHOOLS THAN WE HAVE EVER BEFORE. SEVEN YEARS AGO WE INVESTED FORTY SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR SCHOOLS NEXT YEAR WITH YOUR SUPPORT. WILL INVEST OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS BY THE WAY THAT IT COULD FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. WE'RE STILL FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION. IN PER PUPIL FUNDING. SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE. IT'S LONG OVERDUE THAT WE HAVE THAT HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE FUND OUR SCHOOLS NOT ONLY AT THE STATE LEVEL. BUT THE LOCAL. AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH LET'S REMEMBER THAT THE MEASURE OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS EXCELLENCE IS MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS BUDGETS. WE NEED CLEAR AND ACHIEVABLE STANDARDS OF TRANSPARENCY. MORE INFORMATION SHARING IN ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS TRADITIONAL AND CHARTER SCHOOL. WE ALSO NEED A NEW PRESIDENT FOR THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO WORK WITH OUR SUPERINTENDENT. TONY THURMOND. WELCOME STUDENTS AND MARK THANK. THAT POSITION IS NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT LINDA DARLING HAMMOND [inaudible] THANK. THERE'S ANOTHER. URGENT MORAL ISSUE. WE MUST CONFRONT. THAT'S THIS HOMELESSNESS HOMELESSNESS. EPIDEMIC. SO MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S ALMOST WHETHER THEIR THEIR FAMILIES VETERANS VICTIMS OF RENT SPIKES OR SURVIVORS PLANE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE INVISIBLE AND LEFT BEHIND BY OUR SOCIETY. TOO MANY ON THE STREETS ARE SUFFERING FROM BIPOLAR DISORDER SCHIZOPHRENIA PARANOIA MANY OF THEM SELF MEDICATING WITH DRUGS OR ALCOHOL ADDICTION. IS A CONSEQUENCE ARE HOMELESS CRISIS IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. LAST YEAR WE HAD HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO RECENTLY THERE'S AN OUTBREAK A SURPLUS. UP IN SO NO MY TYPE BASE. IN LOS ANGELES. TYPE X.. EIGHT MADE EVIL DISEASE AND CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETY I KNOW MAYOR IS I KNOW COUNTY SUPERVISOR CITY COUNCIL ALL AROUND THE STATE ARE WORKING HARD. TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AND ITS UNDERLYING CAUSES BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THEIR BACKS THEY CANNOT DO IT ALONE. STANDING UP AT THE IN. WE DID DISCUSS INSTANCE KEEPS STANDING UP THERE ARE -- APPOINTING THERE ARE STEINBERG TO A NEW COMMISSION ON HOMELESSNESS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING THANK YOU MAYOR SCOTT WITH YOUR SUPPORT. WE'RE GONNA PUT UP. ANOTHER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS INTO IMMEDIATE FUNDING FOR NAVIGATION CENTERS MERCY SHELTERS WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ON SITE. WITH THIS BOOK ABOUT ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THE WHOLE THREE HOUSING. MENTAL HEALTH AND MORE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY SHELTER SOL SLEEP HOUSING AND SUPPORT SERVICES SOLVED HOMELESS TALK ABOUT SOMETHING. WE TOO OFTEN OVERLOOK. THE GOLDEN STATE IS GETTING GRAYER. WE NEED TO GET READY FOR THIS MAJOR DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGE HEADED OUR WAY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY OLDER CALIFORNIANS WHAT OUR NUMBER YOUNG CHILDREN. OVER THE NEXT DECADE OR STATEWIDE SENIOR POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE BY FOUR MILLION. IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT'S GOING TO DOUBLE. IN MORE THAN HALF WILL REQUIRE SOME FORM OF LONG TERM CARE. GOING ALL THOSE NO BOUNDARIES AGING DOESN'T CARE WHAT RACE YOU ARE YOUR ECONOMIC STATUS WHETHER YOU'RE SINGLE. OR YOU HAVE FAMILY SUPPORT. AND I HAVE SOME PERSONAL. AND PAINFUL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS RECENTLY I I LOST MY FATHER SOME YOU KNOW OVER THE HOLIDAYS AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF DECLINING PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND DIMENSION. YOU WAS THE TERMINAL LIVE OUT HIS DAYS WITH DIGNITY. YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE RETIRED PUBLIC OFFICIAL WITH OF A GOOD PENSION. AND A SUPPORT CIRCLE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS BUT EVEN WITH ALL OF THOSE ADVANTAGE. ALL OF THOSE ADVANTAGES. WITH THE DAILY CHALLENGE FOR HIM TO MEET HIS NEEDS SO HE CAN LIVE IN PLACE AND MAINTAIN. A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIAN SHERRY SIMILAR STORY AND THE NUMBERS. ARE THE ONLY GROW. IT'S TIME FOR A NEW MASTER PLAN ON AGING IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW IT'S GOT -- DRESS PERSON CENTERED CARE. THE PATCHWORK OF PUBLIC SERVICES. GOT ADDRESS SOCIAL ISOLATION. BETTER LOCK SENIORS THE NEED TRANSPORTATION. DRESS THE NURSING SHORTAGE LV ENDS IN OUR ENDS. AND THE DEMAND ON AYE HSS ARNOLD SUPPORT SERVICES THAT FAR OUTPACES ITS CAPACITY. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT. AGING WITHOUT ALSO FOCUSING ON ALL TIMES. TOO MANY OF US IN THE CRUSHING GRIP OF THIS DISEASE ON OUR LOVED ONES ESPECIALLY ON OUR WIVES AND MOTHERS. BECAUSE TWO THIRDS OF ALL NEW ALZHEIMER'S CASES ARE WOMEN. TWO THIRDS. SO TODAY I'M WATCHING THE ALL TIMES PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS TASK FORCE BRING IN THE MOST RENOWNED SCIENTIST AND THINKERS TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THE FIRST OF ITS KIND RESEARCH IN THIS AREA. IT WILL BE HEADED. BY LEADING ADVOCATE FOR FAMILIES DEALING WITH ALZHEIMER'S. AND THAT IS OUR FORMER EIGHTY MARIA SHRIVER [inaudible] AND WE'RE UHHUH DIE TOGETHER. MANY OF THESE ARE CHALLENGES WE FACE IS THE BROADER COST. CRISIS. IN A RECENT SURVEY CAME OUT LAST WEEK 61% OF YOUNG ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE. 61%. CALIFORNIA SHOULD NEVER BE A PLACE WHERE ONLY THE WELL OFF CAN LEAD A GOOD LIFE. AND IT STARTS WITH HOUSING PERHAPS THE MOST OVERWHELMING CHALLENGE WE FACE RIGHT NOW. WE ALL KNOW THE PROBLEM. WELL THE PROBLEM. TOO MUCH DEMAND. TOO LITTLE SUPPORT. AND THAT IS HAPPENING IN LARGE PART BECAUSE TOO MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES AREN'T EVEN PLANNING HOW TO BUILD. SUMMER FLAT OUT REFUSING TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL. THAT'S WHY I COMMITTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A MAJOR NEW INCENTIVE PACKAGE FOR COMMUNITIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORT FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO UPDATE THEIR HOUSING PLANS TO REVAMP THERE'S ONLY PROCESS AND GET MORE HOUSING ENTITLED. FIVE HUNDRED MORE IN GRANTS WHEN THEY ACHIEVE CERTAIN MILESTONES. PUT IT WE WANT A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WE HAVE TO BUILD HOUSING FOR ALL I WANT TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I WANT TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. LIKE ANAHEIM. LIKE SANTA ROSA. BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT. CAN ALL TWO WEEKS AGO. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUED THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH FOR FAILING TO MEET. ITS OBLIGATIONS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING LET ME JUST TELL YOU LOOK AT THE FORMER MAYOR THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS THE START MY TERM. SUING THE CITY. BUT RESPECTFULLY THEY LEFT US NO CHOICE. BY THE WAY IT'S NOT BOB PICKING ON HUNTINGTON BEACH THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE FIRST BECAUSE OF A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. BUT THERE ARE FORTY SEVEN OTHER CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH THEIR PLANNING REQUIREMENTS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. SOME CITIES ARE TRYING LIKE CLOTHES. BUT OTHERS RESPECTFULLY. LIKE WE WENT. HUNTINGTON PARK MONTEBELLO THEY'RE NOT. SOME INVITING ALL THE CITY LEADERS TO SIT DOWN WITH ME IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEXT WEEK FOR A CANDID CONVERSATION. I DO NOT INTEND TO FILE SUIT AGAINST ALL FORTY SEVEN BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PRESIDE OVER NEGLECT AND DENIAL ANY LONGER I WAS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL I I'M NOT NAIVE. THAT CITIES NEED TO SOME OF THAT POLITICAL COURAGE AND WE GONNA HAVE THEIR BACKS. OKAY I ALSO WANTING KNOWLEDGE. THAT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS BEYOND CITY PLANNING THAT HAVE LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSES. IN RECENT YEARS YOU KNOW. WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB EXPEDITING JUDICIAL REVIEW ON SEA QUEST FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS THERE'S SOME GOOD THINGS HAPPENING. SOMEONE APPLAUD. THE RECENT EFFORTS BY HOME BUILDERS AND LABOR LEADERS WHO TOGETHER WORKING TO FORGE A COMPROMISE IN THE SPACE TO ACCELERATE PRODUCTION. BUT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR AMBITIOUS TARGETS UNLESS WE TRAIN A SKILLED WORKFORCE. THAT'S BIG ENOUGH TO MEET THE CHALLENGE AND ALSO. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE WORKERS THAT ARE GETTING WAGES THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO ALSO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. PLEASE. AT THE PURCHASE PROCESS AND AND LET'S BRING MORE PEOPLE TO THE TABLE TO GET SOMETHING BIG DONE I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN DO THAT THIS YEAR. AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT. LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. A LOT OF US MADE COMMITMENTS MYSELF INCLUDED. AFTER PROPOSITION TEN FAILED AT THE BALLOT LAST NOVEMBER. AND THE PRESSURE ON VULNERABLE RENTERS DID NOT GO AWAY. AFTER ELECTION. WE NEED NEW RULES TO STABILIZE NEIGHBORHOODS TO PREVENT THE VACATIONS WITHOUT PUTTING SMALL LANDLORDS OUT OF BUSINESS. SO I WANT THE BEST IDEA FROM EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER AND HERE'S MY PROMISE TO YOU. GET ME A GOOD PACKAGE ON RENT STABILITY THIS YEAR AND I WILL SIGN WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT OBTAINING THE COST CRISIS. WE ALSO NEED TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT. MAKING SURE HEALTHCARE IS A FOR FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND OUR ABILITY ABILITY TO INVEST. IT EVERYTHING WE CARE ABOUT IS CONSTRAINED BY THIS ISSUE BY THE GROWING PRESSURE. HAS BEEN FOR YEARS ARE DESTROYING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEIR VANDALISM BY THE WAY IS ALREADY DONE. EXTRAORDINARY DAMAGE IN CALIFORNIA BY ELIMINATING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. THIS YEAR COVERED CALIFORNIA'S PREMIUMS INCREASED ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH. AS WE HAD EXPECTED. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE FEAR AND RESPECT LIKE IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT. AND THAT'S WHY WHEN IT COMES TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE CALIFORNIA MUST ACT WHERE WASHINGTON HAS FAILED. WE DO THIS WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DEEPEN SUBSIDIES FOR THOSE EARNING UP TO FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AN EXTENDED SUBSIDIES TO FAMILIES. EARNING UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SOMETHING NO OTHER STATE IN AMERICA HAS DONE. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. ON ANOTHER ISSUE. WE ALL KNOW THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS AMONG THE LOWEST MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN AMERICA. AND THAT'S WHY IN OUR BUDGET WE DEVOTE MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE RATES AND ADDRESS THE GROWING PROVIDERS SHORTAGE. THIS THIS INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH MEASURES LIKE IMMUNIZATIONS PROMISE SCREENINGS AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL AS PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNING WHAT WE PURSUE THE LONG TERM GOAL SINGLE PAYER FINANCING LET US MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT NOW? LIKE SPENDING MEDI CAL COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS IS ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION. COSTS IS ANOTHER. WE MUST ADDRESS RISING COSTS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. LIKE THE CONSOLIDATION OF HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WHICH IN MANY CASES LIMITED PATIENT CHOICE. THEY MADE MEDICAL CARE SIMPLY MORE EXPENSIVE WE ALSO MUST CONTINUE TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. MY MY MY FIRST HALF HIS GOVERNMENT. WAS TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR SINGLE PURCHASING SYSTEM THE LARGEST STATE BUYER IN THE NATION WHICH BY THE WAY WILL SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO THANK. AT LEAST SOMEONE CARES ABOUT THAT SAVINGS BUT I WANT TO THANK I WANT TO THANK. PRESIDENT TRUMP. I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT SHRUB FOR CALLING ATTENTION TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES LAST WEEK IN A STATE OF THE UNION. THIS IS A BI PARTISAN ISSUE AT LEAST IT SHOULD BE AND I HOPE HE FOLLOWS THROUGH AND TAKES THE LEAD OF CALIFORNIA IN THE PROCESS. I LET'S TALK ABOUT JOBS YOU KNOW. WE GOT ASK OURSELVES. HOW DO WE CREATE A FUTURE? WITH MORE GOOD JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING LIVE IN CALIFORNIA MORE AFFORDABLE COST IS ONLY ONE SIDE. OF THE EQUATION THE OTHERS INCOME. SO DESPITE OUR OUR ROOM RISING WAGES WORKING FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA TODAY BARELY EARN MORE THAN THEY DID A DECADE AGO. MANY WORKING PARENTS ARE MAKING LESS THAN THEIR PARENTS DID AT THE SAME AGE. THAT'S WHY WITH YOUR SUPPORT. WE WERE BOOKED RE PROVIDING THIS YEAR A COST OF LIVING REFUND BY EXPANDING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT TWO EIGHT MILLION MORE CALIFORNIA THE BUDGET FOR FAMILIES WITH KIDS UNDER THE AGE SIX THEY WILL SEE THEIR BENEFITS GO UP BY AS MUCH AS THREE TIMES. LOOK IN THIS ECONOMY J. BACK. LOOK IN THIS ECONOMY WITH THE WORLD OF WORK IS IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF FLUX WHERE WORKERS ARE TOO OFTEN DISPLACED THE VALUE TO DISCONNECTED FROM THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET WE ALSO MUST. THINK BIGGER. IT'S TIME TO DEVELOP A NEW MODERN COMPACT FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHANGING WORKFORCE. THIS RESPECTFULLY IS MUCH BIGGER THAN DYNAMAX. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE STRATEGY UP LIFT AND UP SKILL OUR WORKERS TO ENSURE THAT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN A AYE BLOCKCHAIN BIG DATA ARE CREATING JOBS NOT DESTROYING JOBS. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO REFORM. OUR INSTITUTIONS THAT SO THE MORE WORKERS HAVE AN OWNERSHIP STAKE. IN THEIR SWEAT EQUITY. SO WILL APPOINT A NEW COMMISSION I CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE AND FUTURE OF WORK THAT WILL BRING TOGETHER LEADERS FROM LABOR BUSINESS WILL PUBLIC. AND PRIVATE IN THEIR SIMON IS THIS TO COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS TO EXPAND WORKER OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT EXTINGUISHING INNOVATION OF FLEXIBILITY. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S OBVIOUSLY PROUD. TO BE HOME TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THAT ARE DETERMINED TO CHANGE THE WORLD THE COMPANIES THAT MAKE RESPECTFULLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTING. CURATING MONETIZING OUR PERSONAL DATA ALSO HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT. CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW AND CONTROL HOW THEIR DATA IS BEING USED THANK YOU FOR PASSING THE FIRST IN THE NATION DIGITAL PRIVACY LAW LAST YEAR WELL. CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO SHARE IN THE WEALTH. THAT IS CREATED FROM THEIR DATA SO I ASKED MY TEAM TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW DATA DIVIDEND FOR CALIFORNIA. RE RECORD. TO YOU WE CAN DO SOMETHING BOLD IN THE SPACE. LET ME AND BY MAKING THE OBVIOUS POINT WOULD COVER A LOT OF BROWN. BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT DESERVES OUR FOCUS CLIMATE CHANGE REFORM IN OUR TAX CODE. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. MAJOR NATIONS LIKE PAID SICK LEAVE UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE REIMAGINING THE DMV. THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH MORE IT WILL BE TAKEN OUT ALL THOSE ISSUES AND MORE. IN THE COMING MONTHS. HI MY NOT ARRIVE. A FEW WEEKS BACK I QUOTED THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT. ABOUT A HOUSE.
