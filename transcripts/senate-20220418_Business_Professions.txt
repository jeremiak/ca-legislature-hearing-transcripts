I'VE SAID DR THANK YOU IT'S JUST A QUESTION ABOUT THE ONE OF THE FIRST AUTHOR AMENDMENTS WHICH WAS SAID TWO POINT EXACTLY WHAT EXEMPTS FROM PROVISIONS OF STATE CIVIL SERVICE ACT. WHAT DOES NOT CLARIFY THE REASON FOR EXEMPTING THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM THE CIVIL SERVICE ACT. I'VE BEEN INFORMED THAT ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES ARE EXEMPT AS PHYSICIANS. OKAY ALL EMPLOYEES OF THIS BORDER ALL BOARDS ARE EXEMPT FROM CIVIL SERVICE ACT. CAN YOU ACTUALLY GET. BUT. OKAY. OKAY ALL RIGHT AT A VERY BRIEF I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER- YOU KNOW THE ONE REASONS I RAISE THE QUESTION IS JUST THAT- YOU TOO MANY TIMES AGENCIES HAVE REQUESTED- PARTICULAR. A RESIDENT AGENCIES TO BE EXEMPT FROM CIVIL SERVICE ACT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACTUALLY PAYMENT SALLY STILL DIFFERENT THAN THE CIVIL SERVICE SALARY SCALE. AND TWELVE THAT MAY BE NECESSARY AT TIMES I THINK THAT ALSO RAISES THE QUESTION IF THAT HAPPENS SO FREQUENTLY THAT WE NEED TO REVISIT THE CIVIL SERVICE SALARY SCALE AS WE CAN BE COMPETITIVE AS A STATE. SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT BUT- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER DOES NEED TO BE ABLE TO SERVE AT THE- PLEASURE OF THE BOARD. ITSELF THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'LL BE PRESENTING- SP NINE SIXTY TWO. WHICH ENSURES RESPIRATORY CARE PRACTITIONERS WHO MEET THE COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS STANDARDS MAY WORK AS LABORATORY DIRECTORS AND TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS IN MODERATE. COMPLEXITY LABORATORIES. CALIFORNIA'S REQUIREMENTS FOR LABORATORY PERSONNEL LICENSURE HAVE BECOME A BARRIER FOR OTHERWISE QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS AS DEFINED BY THE COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS REQUIREMENTS. RESPIRATORY CARE PRACTITIONERS ARE TRAINED AND LICENSED TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE BLOOD GASES AND RESPIRATORY SECRETIONS. JUST AS IS NECESSARY IN MODERATE COMPLEXITY LABORATORIES. EARLIER THIS YEAR THERE WERE OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND RESPIRATORY CARE PRACTITIONERS IN CALIFORNIA ANY OF WHOM COULD QUALIFY TO BE TECHNICAL CONSULTANT ACCORDING TO C. P. STANDARDS ASSUMING THEY HOLD  REQUIRED BACHELOR'S DEGREE. THIS BILL UPDATE THE DEFINITIONS OF LABORATORY DIRECTOR AND TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS TO INCLUDE RESPIRATORY CARE PRACTITIONERS THAT MEET THE CAP STANDARDS. THIS CHANGE WILL PROVIDE CAREER ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS ALREADY WORKING IN BUT BLOOD GAS LABS AS REGULAR TESTING PERSONNEL AND HELP FILL THE CURRENT GAP IN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL FOR THOSE LABORATORIES. I'VE GOT TO- AS SOME FOLKS ON THE LINE THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR- QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS AND I THINK SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT LIMITS EACH SIDE TO A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES I'LL TRY TO HOLD YOU TO THAT HERE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE JENNIFER TANNEHILL AND DOCTOR GERALD DIVERSITY IF I PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY. HERE AS LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JENNIFER TANNER HILL WITH THE ERIN READ IT SAYS IT'S ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY FOR RESPIRATORY CARE. BUT I THINK THE- THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US IN THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE FOR WORKING WITH US. TO GET SOME GOOD AMENDMENTS INTO THE BILL. A RESPIRATORY CARE PRACTITIONERS ALSO KNOWN AS RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS WORK WITH VULNERABLE PAPER PATIENT POPULATIONS FROM INFANTS TO THE ELDERLY R. CP'S HAVE SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN CARDIOLOGY AND PULMONOLOGY THEY WORK WITH PATIENTS IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS OPERATING ROOMS OUTPATIENT CLINICS. SLEEP CLINICS LABORATORIES AND HOME HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS EVEN IN HELICOPTERS TRANSPORTING CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS AND MANAGING THE PATIENT'S AIRWAY. MOST RECENTLY R. C. P.'S WORK ON THE FRONT LINES BATTLING CODE NINETEEN FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO BREATHE. IT IS MORE THAN APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW R. CP'S WHO MEET THE REST OF THE COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO LAB DIRECTOR AND TECHNICAL CONSULTANT POSITIONS. IN THE MODERATE COMPLEXITY LABS IN WHICH THEY WORK IN HOSPITALS THESE LABS ARE OFTEN LOCATED IN THIS RESPIRATORY CARE DEPARTMENT. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT I'LL GIVE THE REST OF MY TIME TO DOCTORS OF OR SKI. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M GERALD DIVORCE SKI I HAVE A PHD IN EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE AND I HAVE A LICENSE TO PRACTICE RESPIRATORY CARE IN CALIFORNIA AND ILLINOIS. I HAVE PUBLISHED SEVERAL PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES ON BLOOD GASES AND ELECTROLYTES AND LACTATE STABILITY FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS I WORKED IN THE BLOOD GAS LAB AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. THE LAB IS CONSIDERED MODERATELY COMPLEX BASED ON SEVEN CRITERIA FROM THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR REGULATIONS. WHEN I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I DID NOT REALIZE HOW LIMITING THE CURRENT LAWS ARE FOR LABORATORY PERSONNEL. IT IS DISHEARTENING THAT SOMEONE WITH A PHD IN A LICENSE TO PRACTICE RESPIRATORY CARE. WITH NUMEROUS PUBLICATIONS IN THE SCIENTIFIC FIELD DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A TECHNICAL CONSULTANT. IN A MODERATE COMPLEXITY LAB. HOWEVER CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENTIST WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE ARE ELIGIBLE AS TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS IN CALIFORNIA. A TECHNICAL CONSULTANT ISA VITAL LABORATORY POSITION SINCE THEY PERFORM YEARLY COMPETENCY CHECK OFFS FOR LAB PERSONNEL. TO MAINTAIN LAB ACCREDITATION. IT HAS BEEN HIGHLY FRUSTRATING NOT TO PERFORM THIS THIS KIND OF JOB THAT I WAS INITIALLY HIRED FOR. THE FEDERAL CLEAR REGULATIONS REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WITH RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AS A LABORATORY DIRECTOR OF A MODERATE COMPLEXITY LAB. THIS BILL SB NINE SIXTY TWO GOES BEYOND THE KLIA BY REQUIRING THE MORE STRINGENT COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS GUIDELINES FOR LABORATORY PERSONNEL LICENSURE. THE COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS GUIDELINES REQUIRE A LABORATORY DIRECTOR TO HAVE A DOCTORATE IN A BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE AMONG OTHERS AND ONE YEAR EXPERIENCE IN LAB SUPERVISION. ANOTHER PATH TO LAB DIRECTORSHIP IS A MEDICAL LICENSE AND ONE YEAR A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. TO BE CONSIDERED A TECHNICAL CONSULTANT THE COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS REQUIRE THE SAME BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND TWO YEARS OF LAB EXPERIENCE ALL RESPIRATORY CARE PRACTITIONERS ARE TRAINED IN BLOOD SAMPLING ANALYSES INTERPRETATION. AND IT SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER THE TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS OR LABORATORY DIRECTOR POSITIONS IF THEY MEET THE COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS STANDARDS. DATA FROM THE RESPIRATORY CARE BOARD OF CALIFORNIA SHOW THAT ABOUT 30% OF ALL RESPIRATORY CARE PRACTITIONERS HAVE AT LEAST A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. SIX MILLION SEVEN THOUSAND THERAPISTS OF ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PRACTITIONERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CAREER ADVANCEMENTS AS TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS IN MODERATE COMPLEXITY LABS IF THE COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS GUIDELINES ARE FOLLOWED. ABOUT ONE HUNDRED RESPIRATORY CARE PRACTITIONERS WOULD ALSO QUALIFY AS LABORATORY DIRECTORS IN THE STATE. THUS THIS BILL SB NINE SIXTY TWO WOULD ALLOW CAREER ADVANCEMENT AND HELP BLOOD GAS LABS HOUSE IN RESPIRATORY CARE DEPARTMENTS COMPLY WITH ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS FURTHERMORE THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT DILUTE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS SINCE PRACTITIONERS ARE TRAINED IN BLOOD GAS ANALYSES AND MUST MEET THE COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS GUIDELINES IT IS FOR THIS REASONS THESE REASONS. THAT I REQUEST YOUR I VOTE I AM AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR TELL US HERE FOR MANY OTHER WITNESSES- IN THE GALLERY IF THERE ARE ANY. I SEE NONE LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT. ANY SUCH INDIVIDUALS WAY AND TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL NINE SIX TWO.

I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION TODAY. IN OUR ORIGINAL LICENSING BILL WE ASKED FOR THE TITLE PHYSICIAN WHICH WE USE IN SURROUNDING STATES BUT AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CMA AGREED TO THE TITLE OF DOCTOR INSTEAD. THAT AGREEMENT HAD BROAD IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW NOT YOUR BROTHER DOCTORS ARE ABLE TO PRACTICE IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING DESPITE BEING LICENSED AS INDEPENDENT PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS. THESE APPLICATIONS ARE DUE TO LANGUAGE USING CODES REGULATIONS NOT DUE TO THE TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS OF NATURAL CATHOLIC DOCTORS. S. B. NINE AND FOUR ADDRESSES ONE OF THESE LIMITATIONS BY ALLOWING NATURAL PATHAK DOCTORS TO HIRE LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES. AND THESE ARE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT SCOPE OF PRACTICE ARE ABLE TO PERFORM PHYSICAL EXAMS ORDER LABORATORY TESTS AND IMAGING DRAW BLOOD. PERFORM CLEARLY LABORATORY TESTING IN OFFICE AND ADMINISTER IV USING INJECTIONS.

HELLO GERMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR STEPHEN MANHATTAN I AM THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL DOCTORS ASSOCIATION AND THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR OF CEDAR SINAI'S INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE PROGRAM. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME REAL WORLD IMPACTS AT S. B. NINE AND FOUR WOULD HAVE ON THE PATIENTS THAT WE CARE FOR. AND I WORK AT CEDARS SINAI I HAVE FIRST HAND IMPACTS I SEE IT SEE THE FIRST HAND IMPACTS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO GIVE ORDERS TO LV ENDS. MANY OF MY ND COLLEAGUES- WORK ALONGSIDE MEDICAL DOCTORS AND OSTEOPATHIC OSTEOPATHIC DOCTORS LIKE MYSELF. AND ROB TO PROVIDING CARE AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED TEAM WITH WHOM WE SHARE PATIENTS AND COORDINATE CARE. NOT BEING ABLE TO GIVE ORDERS TO LV ENDS CREATES A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF REDUNDANCY FOR MYSELF. MY PHYSICIAN COLLEAGUES. AND CEDAR SINAI STAFF. PROVIDES UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS- REGULATIONS WHEN L. V. N. AND OUR OFFICE IS DELIVERING CARE PROVIDING INFORMATION TO A PATIENT REGARDING THEIR TREATMENT PLAN. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO REFER TO ANY CONTRIBUTIONS THAT I HAVE MADE TO THEIR WELLNESS PLAN. IN THIS SITUATION THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO EITHER REPEAT ALL MY TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN THEIR OWN PLAN. OR TMS TO USE AN ADDITIONAL SEPARATE STAFF MEMBER AND AUTOMATIC ASSISTANT TO RELAY INFORMATION TO OUR MUTUAL PATIENT. IN OTHER INSTANCES WHEN I'M NOT IN THE OFFICE BUT A PATIENT COMES IN TO RECEIVE AN INJECTION THAT I PRESCRIBE FOR THEM. OR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A BLOOD PRESSURE CHECK WE HAVE TO EITHER RESCHEDULE THE PATIENT OR HOPE THAT ONE OF THE OTHER POSITIONS IN THE OFFICE HAS TIME TO GIVE NEW ORDERS TO OUR STAFF. THEIR IMPACTS ON PATIENTS OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE SETTING AS WELL. IT IS VITAL FOR LPNS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ORDERS FROM ANY DOCTOR WHO IS PRESCRIBING TREATMENTS FOR SOMEONE UNDER THEIR CARE. REGARDLESS OF WHO HIRED THEM. WHEN WE HAVE PATIENTS REQUIRING IN HOME CARE FROM LV ENDS OR WHEN PATIENTS HAVE TRANSITIONED INTO CARE HOMES. L. BRANDS ARE NOT ABLE TO ADMINISTER ANY TREATMENT PRESCRIBED BY THEIR ANTI. UNDER CURRENT REGULATIONS SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A MULTI VITAMIN CANNOT BE GIVEN BY AN LPN TO A PATIENT UNDER THEIR CARE IF IT WAS PRESCRIBE AN ANTI.

THE BILL HAS TEN VOTES WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR- ABSENT MEMBERS. SENATOR COVER EURO. YOU WILL BE PRESENTING- SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX THANK YOU MR CHAIR. GOOD MORNING KEREN MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE CROSS JURISDICTIONAL IMPORT AND EXPORT TO OTHER STATES OF CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS GROWN AND PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA BY AUTHORIZING THE GOVERNOR TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE LAWFUL INTERSTATE COMMERCE. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE NATION'S OLDEST AND LARGEST CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN THE US WITH WIDE KANNST CONSENSUS THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCES MORE CANNABIS THEY CAN THEN IT CONSUMES HISTORICALLY MOST OF THE CANNABIS GROWN IN CALIFORNIA WAS EXPORTED UP 280% BY SOME ESTIMATES AND THIS PROHIBITION HAS CONSEQUENTLY LEFT MANY CALIFORNIA CANNABIS PRODUCERS. LEGAL CANNABIS PRODUCERS WITH NO VIABLE PATHWAY INTO THE LEGAL REGULATED MARKET. WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE MARKET EXPANSION IS ONE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO STABILIZE THE LEGAL INDUSTRY AND MISTER CHAIR I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE SAT THROUGH HEARINGS WHERE WE TALK ABOUT A MYRIAD OF ISSUES WITH- CANNABIS AND PART OF THAT ISSUES ARE ARE TAXING NO QUESTION ABOUT IT- THIS DOESN'T DEAL WITH THAT BUT- ONE OF THIS IS A PARTIAL SOLUTIONS. TO STABILIZE THE LEGAL INDUSTRY AND INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION IN THE REGULATED MARKET HELLO- IS THIS BILL CALIFORNIA WRIST THE CLASS COLLAPSE THE PORTIONS OF THE LEGAL INDUSTRY. THIS WOULD TAKE US BACKWARDS AND WOULD RESULT IN CONSIDERABLE EXPANSION OF THE ILLICIT MARKET IN CALIFORNIA S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX WOULD PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR CALIFORNIA TO PERMIT PROSPEROUS FICTIONAL CANNABIS COMMERCE WITH ANY STATE THAT HAS LEGALIZED CANNABIS USE. CALIFORNIA HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A NET EXPORTER OF CANNABIS AND S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX WILL DEMONSTRATE CALIFORNIA'S WILLINGNESS TO LEGALLY SUPPLIED CANNABIS TO OTHER STATES WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY IMPORTED THESE PRODUCTS ILLEGALLY. AND PRESENT PRESENTLY HAVE DIFFICULTY MEETING THE NEEDS OF THEIR LEGAL OUR- THE PROPOSED INTER INTER STATE CANNABIS ACTIVITIES MUST BE LAWFUL AND SUBJECT TO LICENSORS UNDER BOTH OF THE STATE THE LOSS OF BOTH OF THE STATE. S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX REQUIRES THE AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATE AND TRACK CANNABIS- COLLECTION OF APPLICABLES TAXES ALL THE RULES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND THE LEGAL INDUSTRY ANY OUT OF STATE CANNABIS ITEMS DELIVERED TO CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED TO BE TESTED PACKAGED AND LABELED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX PROVIDES A RELIEF VALVE FOR THE OVER SUPPLY OF CANNABIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW CALIFORNIA'S BRAND AND MARKET SHARE WOULD SUPPORT JOB CREATION AND GIVES THE STATE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AS FEDERAL. TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN FULLY CAPITALIZE ON AND REMAIN A LEADER IN THE FORTHCOMING NATIONAL CANNABIS MARKET I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THE BILL SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS TO DEVELOP AN APPROPRIATE MECHANISM TO ENSURE THE LEGISLATURE'S INVOLVEMENT. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERSTATE AGREEMENT UNDER THIS BILL WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE IS LAUREN FRAZIER SHE'S FROM THE CANNABIS DISTRIBUTION ASSOCIATION SHE WILL BE ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE AND SERRA DOCKET FROM RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WHO IS PRESENT.

THAT WILL ALLOW FOR EXPORT TO LEGAL MARKET WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN A DEMAND FOR CALIFORNIA CANNABIS PROTECTING. THE MARKET ACCIDENTAL FOR CANDIDATES PATIENT AND MARKET EXPANSION BELL FOR CANNABIS OPERATOR. WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED IN LIGHT OF THE SLOW MOVING PROCESS FOR RETAIL EXPANSION HERE WITHIN CALIFORNIA. THOUSANDS OF SMALL FARMS AND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE PUT EVERYTHING ON THE LINE TO ENTER THE LEGAL INDUSTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT. ANY CHEATING INTERSTATE COMMERCE NOW RATHER THAN WAITING YEARS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL LEGALIZATION WOULD BENEFIT BOTH PRODUCER AND CONSUMER STATE OF ALL PATIENTS CONSUMERS SMALL AND SOCIAL EQUITY BUSINESSES AND THE ENVIRONMENT. COORDINATED ACTION BY EIGHT I HAVE LEGALIZED COMMERCIAL CANNABIS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SENSIBLE AND SECURE MULTI STATE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET. TO PROVIDE NECESSARY EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES FOR DATING LEGAL OPERATOR WHILE PORTING A POLICY SHIFT TO GUIDE THE FEDERAL CONVERSATION IN THE COMING YEARS. CALIFORNIA'S LICENSED DISTRIBUTOR REPRESENTED BY THE CANNABIS DISTRIBUTION ASSOCIATION ARE GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR FOR ELEVATING THIS IMPORTANT POLICY AND FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION TODAY THANK YOU.

CERA DOCKETS GOOD MORNING SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE TO CAT ON BEHALF OF THE RULE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX AS SENATOR CAFIERO SPOKE EARLIER CALIFORNIA HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN AN EXPORTER STATE AND SP THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX WOULD ALLOW THE PROSPEROUS DIVISIONAL IMPORT AND EXPORT OF CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS BY AUTHORIZING THE GOVERNOR TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH OTHER LEGALIZED STATES AS MANY AS EIGHTEEN STATES HAVE LEGALIZED ADULT USE AND THIRTY STATES ALLOW MEDICAL USE COORDINATED ACTION BY STATES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED CANNABIS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SENSIBLE AND SECURE. MULTI STATE CANNABIS MARKET WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT FEDERAL SHIFT MANY CANNABIS BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY AT PARTICULARLY IN RULE PRODUCING REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE AND MARKET EXPANSION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION TO STABILIZE THE INDUSTRY AND INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION IN THE REGULATED MARKET WITHOUT MARKET EXPANSION CALIFORNIA RISK THE COLLAPSE OF PORTIONS OF THE LEGAL INDUSTRY DEVASTATING MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES WHICH CAN LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THE ILLICIT MARKET IN DIRE ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO LOCAL ECONOMIES SP THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX IS A MUCH NEEDED RELIEF VALVE FOR THE OVER SUPPLY OF CANNABIS AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS ECONOMY.

THANK YOU MR MODERATOR LET'S BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE CHAMBER COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. THERE ARE TWO LITTLE YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND- I AM SO PLEASED AT THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR FARMERS AND LABOR AS WELL MY CONCERN AND I'M HOPING THAT IN THE BILL OR IN THE FUTURE WE CAN ALLOCATE SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT MAY COME FROM THE EXPORT IMPORTED UP FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF THEM WHERE IN TURN THEY CAN FIGHT THE ILLEGAL GROWERS FIGHT THE ILLEGAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF MARIJUANA- IN AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO YOU FORESEE THAT- THERE WILL BE ALLOCATED FUNDS WITH THE ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS THAT. MAY COME FROM THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY. THE QUESTION SURE THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR TO LEAD APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- THE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE- THE FINANCING PORTION. OR THE TAXING PORTION OF THE MARIJUANA MARKET NEEDS TO BE. REORGANIZED I'VE BEEN PART OF A HEARING WHERE WE LOOKED AT THAT AND- IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND IT'S PART OF WHAT IS DRIVING PEOPLE TO THE ELEVEN ILLICIT MARKET BECAUSE THE TAXES ARE SO HIGH. THAT IT'S A LOT CHEAPER TO BUY FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS CONCERNED ABOUT AS WELL IS THAT IT THEY'RE FIGHTING ON ALL FRONTS TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE AND- AND MANAGE AND PART OF IT IS THAT TAX STRUCTURE SO I HAVE NO. NO DOUBT IN MY MIND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETHINK IT- HOW WE DO OUR TAXES IT'S FAIRLY COMPLICATED AND THAT'S NOT THE SUBJECT OF THIS BILL BUT IT CERTAINLY CAN BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE THAT COULD BE PART OF A COMPACT IS THAT ADDITIONAL REVENUES WOULD GO TO INSURE THAT WE- ARE MAINTAINING A LIT. A LEGAL MARKET AND THAT WE'RE DRIVING THE ILLEGAL- PRODUCERS OUT OF BUSINESS. BUT YOU'RE FINE MAY. I THINK WHEN THIS WHOLE THING STARTED OBVIOUSLY YEARS AGO WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THE COST. OF THAT THE INDUSTRY WOULD WOULD BE FACING BECAUSE OF THE TAXES AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT WE ALSO I DON'T THINK WE REALIZED THE NUMBER OF IT OF ILLEGAL. FARMS AND- IN THE STATE- NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE OTHER STAGE SO I'M I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN TAKE ANOTHER GOOD LOOK AT THIS AND- AND SENATOR IF YOU WOULD. PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE LOOK INTO THAT TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS SO WE CAN'T FIGHT DELICIOUS. THE LEGAL- GROWERS AND- AND HELP THE INDUSTRY DO WHAT WAS AFTER ACCOMPLISH AND- TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY FOR THEMSELVES BUT ALSO PRODUCE INCOME FOR THE STATE. AND TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO ARE NEAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT I DO APPRECIATE I HAVE ANOTHER BILL IT'S NOT HERE TODAY THAT THAT DEALS WITH THAT WATER DIVERSIONS. AND UP- ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CAUSED BY THE ILLEGAL GROWS AND SO I THINK IF WE PUT A NOTE ON A NUMBER OF PIECES IN PLACE. WE CAN DO A LOT TO REDUCE THE ILLICIT MARKET. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU MR SURNAME ED THANK YOU MR SACK OF A. R. I JUST WANNA SAY BRIEFLY YOU KNOW I AGREE A 100% WITH THE LOGIC OF YOUR BILL I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE ARE GLAD TO SUPPORT TODAY- IN HAPPY TO MOVE IT WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU SIR WILLIAM CENTER CAREER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. UP SIR ATTENDANCE HERE MIKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION AT THE AUTHOR. AUTHOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO QUESTION. UP I HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS BUT NOT ANYTHING IN REGARDS TO WHAT WAS DISCUSSED ON THE ON THE FLOOR AS OF RIGHT NOW BUT MY QUESTION REALLY STEMS AROUND THE PURPOSE BEHIND INCLUDING LANGUAGE TO ADD A FOREIGN LICENSE YOU TO ENGAGE IN COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITIES. I BELIEVE THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THIS BILL- AND PARTICULARLY- AND JUST INTERESTED IN KNOWING IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION IN TERMS OF. HOW MANY YOU KNOW PERMITS ARE GIVEN OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE IN OVERDRAFT BASINS. AND THEN THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE REALLY A SLASH QUESTION. IS REALLY JUST A MESS WITH WATER I MEAN WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE IS. THEFT OF WATER AND A LOT OF IT IS TIED TO. AT ILLEGAL GROWS OF MARIJUANA. AT THAT SEEMS TO BE FRONT AND CENTER OF THIS IF THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. AND SO I JUST WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY SAFEGUARDS IN THIS BILL IN REGARDS TO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR QUESTIONS- FIRST OF ALL IS THAT THE- IN REGARDS TO LICENSEES. THE BILL. REQUIRES THAT ANY AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD ENTER INTO ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD REQUIRE THAT ANY LICENSING RESTRICTIONS THAT WE HAVE. ON OUR OWN LICENSEES WOULD WOULD- HAVE TO BE. MIRRORED IN THE JURISDICTION THAT WERE DOING BUSINESS WITH SO THAT WE WOULDN'T PUT AN UNFAIR BURDEN ON CALIFORNIA LICENSEES- WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME BURDEN ON ANY LICENSEES THAT WANT TO SELL PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA SO IT IT'S A TWO WAY. TO A STREET- NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS IN REGARDS TO THE OVER DRAFTED BASINS ON WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE ARE ILLEGAL GROWS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE STATE- AS- FAR AS UP. UP IN- THAT NORTHERN MOST PART OF THE STATE CLOSE TO OREGON ALL THE WAY DOWN TO- THAT MEXICO BORDER AND THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT HUNDREDS. OF THOUSANDS. OF GALLONS OF- ACTUALLY IT'S NOT YALA'S BECAUSE THEY USE ACRE FEET AS THE AS THE MEASUREMENT- ARE BEING DIVERTED IN ORDER TO. EFFECTUATE THESE GROWS- AND SO- PART OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS TO HAVE A GOOD ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO GO IN. AND TO SHUT DOWN THESE ILLEGAL GROWS. THAT WILL MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN OUR WATER SUPPLY- A LOT OF THE WATER THAT- THAT ENDS UP IN OUR RIVERS IS NOT. GETTING THERE SO THE DELTA IS SHORTED. HUNDREDS OF. OF ACRE FEET ARE HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF ACRE FEET EVERY YEAR AND YET WE'RE TAKING FROM WE'RE NOT DOING WATER DELIVERIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE DELTA DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER SO- THIS IS ONE OF OUR OUR SOLUTIONS IS TO- ONE OF OUR WATER SOLUTIONS IS TO REALLY STOP THE ILLEGAL DIVERSION BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF. A MARIJUANA GROWS IN ADDITION TO THE WATER BEING IMPACTED YOU HAVE- POLLUTION AS WELL AS UNREGULATED- PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES ARE USED ON THESE GROSS SO THAT ALSO CONTAMINATES THE WATER IN THE WELLS- AS WELL SO THE THEFT WATER BECOMES IMPORTANT THIS BILL DOESN'T DEAL WITH THAT BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT IT IS CRITICAL TO OUR- TO OUR WATER SYSTEM THAT WE- WE STOP THESE ILLEGAL GROWS. AND I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE BY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE FOR THE- ANSWERS AND- I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE WITH- THE SAME VARIETY. I HAVE THESE CONCERNS AND WE RESPECTFULLY I'LL BE NOT VOTING FOR THIS BILL ACTUALLY. I HAVE A BILL SENATE BILL TEN EIGHTY FOUR THAT- TOUCHES ON FOREIGN AGRICULTURAL LAND HOLDINGS. I THINK THAT IT COULD BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE OF AN ISSUE AND MORE THAN HAPPY TO YOU KNOW WORK WITH YOU AND OTHERS THAT ARE PART OF YOUR- OF YOUR BILL TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE. BUT- AND HOPEFULLY CAN SUPPORT DOWN THE ROAD THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECOND ROW FOR BRAINS BILL FORD JUST A QUESTION TERMS IF I UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT. IF WE HAVE A COMPACT WITH ANOTHER STATE THAT CERTAINLY ANY- CANNABIS ACCOUNTS OF THAT STATE IN THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE CALIFORNIA'S. CORRECT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT- DURING INSTRUCTIONS IN TERMS OF THE- CONTACTS IF SOMEONE WITH A GROWS IN CALIFORNIA MAINLY FOR EXPORT TO BE SURE THEY FOLLOW CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE GROWING AT A CALIFORNIA THEY MAY HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS OF OUT OF STATE RIGHT TERMS OF SELLING AND THAT OTHER STATE THAT AT LEAST THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA. GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER PROTECTIONS SINCE THEY'RE GROWING IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT OF COURSE IMPACTS OUR STATE EVEN IF THERE LET'S SAY MAINLY EXPORTING ALL OF IT TO THE OTHER STATE AND THE CONTACT. VERY GOOD QUESTION- THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT CHANGES AND WOULD ALLOW- A- EITHER A GROWER OR PRODUCER FOR PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA CAN NOT MEET CALIFORNIA STANDARDS IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERSTATE COMPACT SO- THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF OUR REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIANS AND IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE RECEIVING STATE AS WELL ALL RIGHT APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION I DID HEAR YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK ON LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BEFORE THE BILL GETS ON THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PROVE COMPACTS- SO- WITH THAT- SO HELP SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY TO ALLOW TO BEFORE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR PAM. THE KNOWING SEEING NO OTHER MIKE'S- SIR KABIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THAT THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY. WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL BY SENATOR NEWMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS REFERRED THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS MADAM STAFF DIRECTOR. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY SIXTY PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ROTH. ROTH IRA MELINDA'S ARCHULETA. CHILL OUT I'D BE BACKER. BACKER I. DODD. DOT I A MAN HER TADO. NO HER TADO NARROW JONES LLEVA LEAVE THE ICEMEN MAN I NEWMAN NEWMAN I SHOW ABODE HAN. HE AND I THE VOTE IS EIGHT OZ ONE NO HOLD ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. SENATOR WESSEL. I REMEMBER FIVE SENATE BILL TWELVE FORTY SEVEN PLEASE PROCEED IN READING THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OF FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO JUST CLARIFY THAT- ASKING FOR SEVEN MINUTES ON THIS BILL AND THE REASON WHY- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR MANY MONTHS NOW AND IT'S A COMPLICATED BILL AND REALLY HELPED TO GUIDE US IN TERMS OF WHERE THE BILL NEEDS TO- MOVE. AND SO- WE ARE MAKING SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL AND I WANT TO EXPLAIN KIND OF THE REASONS WHY. BUT BEFORE THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT IN TERMS OF THE BILL AND IT'S ON- IT'S WRITTEN. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST. A STRIKE THE FIRST PARAGRAPH IN ITS ENTIRETY. AND THAT WOULD BE THE PERC GRAPH CURRENTLY NUMBERED. ONE SEVEN EIGHT TWO ZERO. AND EVERY NIGHT READ NUMBER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH CURRENTLY NUMBERED ONE SEVEN EIGHT TWO ONE A AND B. TWO ONE SEVEN EIGHT TWO ZERO A AND B. NOW AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF THIS LANGUAGE WITH THE AMENDED MATT LANGUAGE. IS TO MAKE A CONTRACT MORE EQUITABLE AND MORE TRANSPARENT BETWEEN THE MAKER OF THE CONTRACT IN THE SIGNER. WHERE THE CONTRACT CONTAINS A CLAUSE WHICH REQUIRES THE SIGNER. TO ASSIGN AWAY ALL THEIR RIGHTS TO REBATES. EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVE INCOME AS IT STATED IN THE FACT SHEET IF YOU HAVE THAT AVAILABLE AND LARGELY WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE YOU KNOW IT IS CALM TORE ATTENTION THAT INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA WHEN THE RENT WITH WITH IN REGARDS TO BUSINESSES MAKING CONTRACTS SPECIFICALLY FRANCHISES- WITH THEIR FRANCHISE STORES OFTEN THERE IS A VERY- UNCLEAR CLAUSES JUST A CLAUSE THAT SAYS THAT YOU SIGN AWAY YOUR RIGHTS. TO ANY- PROMOTIONAL INCOME WITHOUT NECESSARILY STATING HOW MUCH THAT IS AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR REVENUE THAT IS AND WHEN YOU A SIGN AWAY YOUR RIGHTS YOU ACTUALLY ASSIGN AWAY ACTUALLY- PRODUCT PLACEMENT RIGHTS- YOU- HE COULD YOU COULD EVEN- SIGN AWAY IN TERMS OF- WHAT AMOUNT OF YOUR BUSINESS PLAN IS THAT DEDICATED TO A SPECIFIC ENDEAVOR. WHEN THAT HAPPENS GIVING YOU AN EXAMPLE LET'S SAY ON VALENTINE'S DAY THE FRANCHISE OR THE MAKER OF THE CONTRACT AND SAY YOU HAVE TO DISPLAY THIS PRODUCT IN THE MOST PROMINENT LOCATION AND THAT COULDN'T COULDN'T HAVE A HUGE INFLUENCE AND HOW MUCH THAT PRODUCT. IS MOVED WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS. SO WHEN WE CAME TO. THE UNDERSTANDING THAT A LOT OF TIMES THESE- SIGNERS OF THESE CONTRACTS SPEND A LOT OF TIME MOVING PODUCTS THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY IN THEIR OWN BUSINESS PLAN INTERESTS ARE OFTEN WORKING. FOR THE MAKER OF THE CONTRACT WHO MAKES QUITE A BIT OF REVENUE FROM THE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS WITHOUT EVER HAVING DISCLOSED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT PERIOD ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT PROCESS BE TRANSPARENT. THAT THE SIGN OF THE CONTRACT UNDERSTAND THAT HERE'S A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS- EXCHANGED THROUGH THIS PROCESS WHEN THEY GIVE AWAY THEIR RIGHTS THEY'RE GIVEN AWAY- RIGHTS TO- IMPORTANT GAINS THAT COULD HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR BUSINESSES OFTEN TIMES IF YOU CAN IMAGINE A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA. OFTEN TIMES- CERTAIN UMBRELLA OF A FRANCHISE OFTEN TIMES CAN DO BETTER IN SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE STATE. THEN IN OTHERS. AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO AT LEAST OPERATE UNDER. A STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SURVIVE SO YOU KNOW OFTEN TIMES THE CENTERS OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE VERY SMALL- THESE ARE NEW- BUSINESS PEOPLE THAT ARE OFTEN INVESTING. THEIR THEIR LIFE SAVINGS INTO A BUSINESS THAT IS OFTEN TIED. TO A FRANCHISE- ARRANGEMENT. SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD WE EXPECT TO MAKE THE RIGHT AMENDMENTS IN TERMS OF TO- GET TO THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE. OF DISCLOSURE IN THE CONTRACT SIGNING PROCESS THOSE. REBATES PROMOTIONS AND INCENTIVES- OFTENTIMES ARE ARE A BIG PART OF THIS CONTRACT YET THEY'RE SILENT. THERE IS NO INFORMATION EXCHANGE IN THE PRIMARY PART OF THIS PROCESS TO ACCOUNT FOR. WHAT IS A REALLY BIG PART OF THE OF THE BUSINESS PLAN. SO THERE THERE'S FEDERAL LAW THAT IS GENERAL IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING REVENUE. BUT UNDER UNDER- I THINK AND I'M WHAT WE'RE LEARNING OF THIS PROCESS IS THAT MANY NEW STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO. AVOID DISCLOSURE INCLUDING A HIDING SOME OF THIS REVENUE IN TERMS OF- IN IN PROMOTIONS AND REBATES AND INCENTIVES WHICH ARE WAY I WE THINK AROUND FEDERAL LAW AND I THINK CALIFORNIA. NEEDS TO STAND UP FOR OUR OUR ALL THE SMALL BUSINESS PERSON THAT- NEEDS TO GO INTO THESE CONTRACTS COMPLETELY AWARE. OF WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING. ONE OF YOU KNOW ONE LAST THING. THAT I'D LEFT. AT LIKE TO ADD- JUST GENERALLY- YOU KNOW. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I'M ASKING THIS COMMITTEE TO KIND OF WORK WITH ME AND I THINK THE MEN MEN'S- THAT WE'RE PROPOSING AT LEAST WILL MAKE THIS BILL A PAL PALATABLE IT WILL REMOVE OPPOSITION BUT WE ARE EXPECTING OPPOSITION IN THE FUTURE I THINK. THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY. THAT THE COMPANIES THAT STAND TO GAIN FROM THESE PROMOTIONS WILL WILL DEFINITELY. HAVE AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT TO SHOW THAT THEY THERE IS A CERTAIN INCOME THIS NOT BEING DISCLOSED IN THE CONTRACT I'M SURE I'M NOT I DON'T KNOW THIS FOR CERTAIN BUT- BUT- I KNOW IN THIS PROCESS I KNOW THEY MIGHT COME OUT AND PUT OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SO WANT FULL DISCLOSURE. TO KNOW WHAT DIRECTION WE INTEND TO MOVE- D. LAST THING I WANTED TO MENTION THAT I THINK IS VERY KEY. IMAGINE YOU ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH A COMPANY THAT SAYS YOU NEED TO BUY FROM THIS BUS SUPPLIER UNDER OUR CONTRACT CONTRACT I'M COMPLETELY OBLIGATED. FROM BUYING FROM THAT SUPPLIER I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE UNDER THAT AGREEMENT. I HAVE TO ACTUALLY APPLY AND GET A CREDIT APPROVAL AND GET APPROVED SO THE- THE UMBRELLA CORPORATION A MAKES ME SIGNS AGREEMENT DOESN'T GIVE ME ANY PROTECTION FROM THE SUPPLIER DOESN'T. GIVE ME ANY CREDIT IT DOESN'T GIVE ME THE YOU KNOW HELP ME SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SUPPLIER I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS SEPT SEPARATELY AS THE SIGNER TO THE CONTRACT. AND ONCE I'VE DONE THAT. THEY HAD THESE. DEALS THAT THEY THESE BLANKET DEALS AT THE DATE OF ENTRY INTO WITH ALL THE SUPPLIERS. THAT GIVE THEM A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW REBATES SO WHATEVER PRICE I GET FROM THAT SUPPLIER. THEY ARE GETTING A PERCENTAGE IN THE FORM OF A REBATE OR SOME INCENTIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE CREATED. MARK MORE US SALES AND ACTIVITY- I THINK- THAT IS- WHAT FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF SIGNERS THEY WERE EVEN A VAGUE WHERE. THAT THAT SITUATION EXISTED AT THE TIME OF SOCKS SIGNING THE CONTRACT AND I THINK THAT IS. EXTREMELY UNFAIR IN THIS PROCESS AND ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS FAIRNESS WE WANT PEOPLE TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT. WITH A COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S ON THE TABLE WHEN THEY SIGNED A CONTRACT IN THE DECIDE TO SIGN THAT CONTRACT WITH PROVISIONS I THINK THAT. IS THEIR DECISION BUT AT LEAST UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW WE WOULD PROTECT THE SIGNER. WAS- YOU KNOW INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT HE IS OR SHE- OR THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE- PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACT AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR- GIVEN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT AMENDMENTS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE ALL CLEAR ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE CHAMBER. AND WHAT THE PROPOSED AUTHOR AMENDMENT IS THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE ACCEPTED. IT'S FAIRLY LIMITED IT'S SET FORTH ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL REQUIRES REPORTING TO FTP WHICH THE AUTHOR IS PROPOSING TO REMOVE. ON PAGE TWO STRIKE LINE SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE INCLUSIVE BEGINNING WITH THE WORDS ANY MANUFACTURER. AND ENDING WITH ENDING WITH THE WORDS OR OTHER MONETARY INCENTIVE. TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THAT'S THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS. NOTICED TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S THE AMENDMENT WILL BE VOTING ON TODAY IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING PERFECT. LET'S MOVE TO ANYONE WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT FIRST IN THE GALLERY ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SAYING NONE LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE.

FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE WILL PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE LAW SURROUNDING SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST ABILITIES TO PERFORM FLEXIBLE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF SWALLOWING. COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS FEES BY MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THEY MUST RECEIVE WRITTEN VERIFICATION FROM CERTIFIED EAR NOSE AND THROAT DOCTOR THAT THE S. L. P.

AS WE ALL KNOW COVER NINETEEN HAS HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED IMPACT ON SERVICE DELIVERY IMPACTING HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND THE PATIENTS THEY SERVE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES MEETING THE EMERGING THING THE EMERGING NEEDS OF PATIENTS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AS PART OF THE INTER PROFESSIONAL TEAMS. SLP SO PEAS HAVE A VITAL ROLE IN PERFORMING FEES EVALUATIONS TO INFORM DYSPHAGIA MANAGEMENT THIS FEATURE OR SWALLOWING DYSFUNCTION CAN LEAD TO POSSIBLE LUNG INFECTIONS LIMITING A PERSON'S FOOD AND LIQUID CHOICES FOR SAFETY WHICH CAN LEAD TO REDUCED OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND EVEN DEPRESSION. THESE ASSESSMENTS AND SWALLOWING ARE NECESSARY TO ASSESS. THEIR NGO DYSPLASIA AND DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE INEFFICIENT TREATMENT PLAN QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN IN THE FIELD REGARDING THE EXTENT OF THE AUTHORIZATION NEEDED BY ANY YOUR NOSE AND THROAT DOCTOR AND WHETHER IT IS A ONE TIME AUTHORIZATION BASED ON THE SLP COMPETENCY OR IF THE AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED EVERY TIME. AND S. L. P. HAS TO PERFORM ONE OF THESE PROCEDURES THIS HAS RESULTED IN SOME INSTANCES WITH AN SLP NOT BEING ABLE TO PERFORM THE NEEDED EVALUATION OR NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM IT IN THE LOCATION BASED ON THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY THE CALL FOR THE F. P. FEES PROCEDURE TO BE PERFORMED IN MULTIPLE SETTINGS HAS GROWN TO INDEPENDENT MAKE DUE TO THE NUMBER OF POET PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD TO BE INTO THE IT INTO BAITED.

SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM WE CONSISTENTLY PERFORM APPROXIMATELY FORTY EXAM TOMORROW. AND MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE PATIENT'S POINT OF CARE. GIVEN THE PROFOUND IMPACT YOU CAN HAVE FOR PATIENTS WHO FOLLOWED ORDERS I FOUND THAT NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE TO PATIENTS WHO LIVE IN RURAL AREAS.

AUTHENTICATION CAN MAKE A ONE A TWO HOUR DRIVE TO A LARGER CITY WALK INTO A CLINIC OR HOSPITAL TO HAVE THE PROCEDURE PERFORMED. OTHER PATIENTS MAY HAVE DEBILITATING MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT MAKE TRANSFERS EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AND WERE IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO MENTION COSTLY IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED EXPENSES.

IS THAT CORRECT. I'M SORRY ONE MORE TIME THOSE- SO ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS IN THE BILL THAT THE FEES PROCEDURE WOULD ONLY BE PERFORMED ONLY UPON ORDERS OF A LICENSED PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON. SO AND THEREFORE HOPEFULLY THAT LICENSED PHYSICIAN SURGEON WOULD BE EVALUATING IF THERE'S ANY CONTRIBUTIONS WERE PERFORMING THE PROCEDURE FOR THAT PARTICULAR PATIENT. AND I WILL LET MY WITNESSES ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR YOU THANK YOU. HELLO THERE SO MY RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD BE THAT WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY AS A TEAM SO- I ALSO WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE PATIENT WAS APPROPRIATE IN RECOMMENDING REQUESTING THE TASK TO GET AN ORDER FROM THE POSITION- IF THAT PATIENT HAD ANY- CONTRA INDICATIONS WE WOULD NOT DO THAT TASK WE WOULD MAYBE DO A DIFFERENT TACT OR WAIT.

BILL HAS TWELVE VOTES WILL HOLD THE ROPE OF REPS AND MEMBERS. SO LET'S MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER THREE SENATE BILL TEN THIRTY ONE HEALING ARTS BOARDS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN VERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TEN THIRTY ONE S. B. TEN THIRTY ONE REQUIRES HEALING ART BOARDS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO REDUCE THE RENEWAL FEE FOR INACTIVE LICENSES TO NO MORE THAN HALF OF THE FEE FOR RENEWAL. OF AN ACTIVE LICENSE LICENSE PROFESSIONALS WHO RECEIVE THEIR LICENSE YOU'RE FROM A BOARD UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS MAY CHOOSE TO TEMPORARILY PAUSE THEIR PRACTICE AND APPLY FOR AN ACTIVE LICENSE AT THE TIME FOR RENEWAL WHILE ON INACTIVE STATUS A LICENSEE IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PRACTICE THEIR PROFESSION. AND WITHOUT HAVING TO MEET LICENSE RENEWAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING CONTINUATION EDUCATION COURSES. DESPITE THE REDUCED NEED FOR THE LICENSEES DESIGNATED BOARD TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OVER THEIR WORK THE RENEWAL FEE ASSESSED ON AN INACTIVE LICENSE IS TYPICALLY THE SAME RATE AS THE FEE ASSESSED ON AN ACTIVE LICENSE E. WE THE WORSENING. SHORTAGE AMONG HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THE STATE PROVIDE. FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY FOR WORKERS WHO CHOOSE TO TAKE A TEMPORARY PAUSE ON THEIR PROFESSION. ON AN INACTIVE LICENSE PROVIDES FOR LONG TERM FLEXIBILITY AND ALLOWS WORKERS TO USE THE HIATUS FOR A MULTITUDE OF REASONS INCLUDING RECOVERING FROM BURNOUT STARTING A FAMILY OR TAKING CARE OF A LOVED ONE WITH A LONG TERM HEALTH ISSUES. ALTHOUGH INACTIVE STATUS PROVIDES FOR FLEXIBILITY LOGISTICALLY IF RENEWAL FEES ARE NOT REDUCED AS COMPARED TO AN ACTIVE STATUS LICENSE IT MAY HINDER WORKERS FROM BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE FINANCIAL DECISION TO GO ON INACTIVE STATUS. MOREOVER MAINTAINING AN INACTIVE LICENSE MAKES FOR A MUCH EASIER TRANSITION BACK TO ACTIVE LICENSE STATUS AS COMPARED TO A LICENSED PHYSICIAN TRANSITIONING THEIR LICENSE FROM DELINQUENT OR RETIRED STATUS. BY REQUIRING THE RENEWAL FEE FOR AN ACTIVE LICENSE TO BE NO MORE THAN HALF THE AMOUNT OF THE FEE FOR RENEWAL OF AN ACTIVE LICENSE FOR HEALING ART BOARDS. S. B. TEN THIRTY ONE WILL PROVIDE HEALTHCARE LICENSEES WITH FINANCIAL RELIEF AND FLEXIBILITY. IT WILL ALSO INCENTIVIZE INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOOSE TO TAKE A TEMPORARY PAUSE ON THEIR PROFESSION TO GO ON INACTIVE STATUS RATHER THAN DELINQUENT ALL RETIRED. WITH THE ON GOING HEALTH CARE LABOR SHORTAGE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE IMPORTANT TIME TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROFESSIONALS DO NOT CHOOSE TO GO ON DELINQUENT OR RETIRED STATUS RATHER THAN INACTIVE STATUS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE COST. I HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT LINDSEY COLOR WORN ON BEHALF OF THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MA'AM YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS ONE OF THE CALL WILL RING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE TRIP REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THOUSAND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY CALIPH AT CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE PLEASED TO BE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TEN THIRTY ONE BECAUSE IT WILL REDUCE COSTS FOR HEALING ARTS LICENSEES- AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR PRACTITIONERS TO RE ENTER THEIR PROFESSION WHEN AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSISTANTS WHICH ARE REGULATED BY THE BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. MAY CONSIDER OR CHOOSE TO APPLY FOR AN ACT OF LICENSE FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS. AND THE NAME OF THE STATE WITH PLANS TO RETURN TO CALIFORNIA. OR THEY MAY SUSPEND THEIR LICENSE TO CARE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER- OR JUST TAKE A BREAK FROM THE PROFESSION. HAVING THE OPTION TO MAINTAIN OF A LICENSEE IN ACTIVE STATUS IS INVALUABLE FOR THESE LICENSEES. AND NECESSARY FOR OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AS THE STATE IS IN THE MIDST OF A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE- BECAUSE RESUMING PRACTICE FROM AN ACTIVE LICENSE IT'S EASIER THAN TRYING TO RE ENTER THE PROFESSION OF A LICENSE AS WELL. LAST M. SO CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE CURRENT AUTHORIZATION A LOT TO ALLOW FOR AN ACTIVE LICENSES WE ALSO RECOGNIZE RECENT STATUTORY CHANGES. THAT ALLOW HEALING ARTS BOARDS TO CHARGE LESS FOR AN ACT OF LICENSE FEES. AND WE DO BELIEVE AS THE TEN THIRTY ONE TAKES THIS A STEP FURTHER AND IS NECESSARY IMPROVES ON EXISTING LAW. BY CAPTAIN CAPPING THE AN ACTIVE LICENSE YET 50% OF THE ACTIVE LICENSE B. I'M JUST FOR O. T. PRACTITIONER'S LICENSE FEES HAVE INCREASED MULTIPLE TIMES IN RECENT YEARS. MOST RECENT INCREASES JUST LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND PAIN EXISTING LICENSE FEES. M. IS ALREADY A FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR MANY O. T. PRACTITIONERS AND OTHER HEALING ARTS PROVIDERS. TO ENSURING THAT THE AN ACT OF LICENSE BECAUSE LESS THAN THE ACTIVE LICENSE RENEWAL FEE WILL HELP RENEW RENEW AT EASE THIS ECONOMIC HARDSHIP FOR LICENSEES. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB TEN THIRTY ONE ENERGY DRIVE AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. WE'RE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM ELIXIR. FROM ANY OTHER SUPPORT WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY. SEEING NO. OTHERS WITNESS. LETS ME TO WITNESS. WITHIN TESTIFY IN VIA THE- OR THIS MATTER. FEUD PLEASE PRESS. ANYWAY WAITING. IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TEN THIRTY ONE WE WILL BEGIN WITH THEM. THANK YOU TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. AGAIN USING YOUR TELEPHONE ONE AND THEN THERE- PLEASE. WE HAVE NO LINES IN Q. THANK YOU MODERATOR NOW LET'S MOVE TO- FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS RATHER IN MOVE TO HEARING FROM ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES FIRST WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY SEEING NONE LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION V. IN THE TELECONFERENCE ORVIS HE WOULD PLEASE PROP THE INDIVIDUALS WHEN IT DOES FIND A POSITION OF SENATE BILL TEN THIRTY ONE. WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THEM. THANK YOU TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PRESS ONE THEN ZERO USING OUR TELEPHONE AGAIN THAT'S ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO PLEASE. WE HAVE NO LINES IN Q. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR LET'S BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CHAMBER OF SIR EDMUND. THANK YOU ANNA THANK YOU TO THE CENTER FOR BRING THIS FORTNIGHT. SINCE CENTER SITS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS- THIS PERFUSED GENERALLY DONE UNDER THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS I'M WONDERING WHY DO A BILL VERSUS JUST LOOKING AT THIS IN THE SENSE THAT PROCESS. BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE WOULDN'T WANT ANY AM ANYMORE TO TAKE A BIG HIT AS WE KNOW THE LICENSE FEES PAYS. FOR THE OVERSIGHT. I'M NOT THE EXPERT EXCELLENT QUESTION I THINK THE REASON WE'RE PUTTING THIS FOURTH RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY OF IT WERE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES THROUGH IN AND- MORE EFFICIENT AND- AND- WAY- SPEEDIER WAY I SHOULD SAY- AND I THINK THE REASON FOR IT RIGHT NOW. THE REASON WE'RE MOVING IT THROGH IS BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A NEED RIGHT NOW WITH- THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE BEEN HAVING ACROSS THE FIELD WITH THE HEALING HEARTS. WITH PEOPLE BEING BURNT OUT IN BEING- JUST. JUST OVERWHELMED THERE WE THOUGHT WHAT A GREAT WAY TO HELP THOSE THAT ARE IN NEED RIGHT NOW- IN OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO BE SURE TO HAVE THE TIME. INSTEAD OF. COMPLETELY RELINQUISHING THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK ARE YOU GIVING UP ON THEIR PROFESSION TO ACTUALLY GIVING THEM A BREAK- AT THIS TIME. THE DECISION PROVIDE EXTRA BREAK IT JUST PROVIDES A REDUCTION OF COST POTENTIALLY. EITHER AN ACTIVE FEES YES IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING I'M SORRY SENATOR EDMUND I GUESS I WAS ASKING. BUT I AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION OKAY YOUR POSITION THANK YOU. HOW IS ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. SEEING NONE OF CENTER TO- DOCTRINE PLEASE THANK YOU SEARCH ABOVE. EIGHT- I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BOARDS BUT I ALSO HEAR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO N. COURSES DURING OUR SUNSET REVIEW ONE OF THINGS WE DO LOOK AT WE LOOK AT THE VARIOUS BUDGETS OF THE BOARDS INCLUDING HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON ENFORCEMENT RIGHT- SO- I THINK IT'S- I THINK THE BILLS WORTH. LOOKING AT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT THE 50% SHOULD SHOULD REALLY BE PERHAPS MORE ADJUSTED FOR THE FACT THAT. YOU MADE THE BOARD SAID THEY HAVE TO STILL SPEND OF COURSE MONEY FOR CERTIFICATION AND SO FORTH THAT WE WOULD WANT TO LEAVE THAT. AMOUNT INTACT BUT SAY THAT WELL SINCE YOU'RE AN ACTIVE. THE ENFORCEMENT PARTS- WHICH THINGS WHICH ARE USING SOCIAL PRACTICE. AT THAT EXPENSE WOULD BE REDUCTIONS SINCE THAT WOULD NOT BE THE BURDEN ON THE POOR FACILITIES AN ACTIVE- TO THAT DEGREE. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT WE WILL BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT THE FEE WE LOOKED AT 50% JUST BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE. A CONSERVATIVE. JUST THE HALFWAY POINT AS TO THE COST SINCE THERE'S NOT. ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DOING AND ANY OVERSIGHT. WITH THE WITH THE INACTIVE FEES IN COMPARISON TO SOMEBODY THAT IS ACTUALLY ACTIVE. THAT'S WHAT WE CAME UP WITH THE FIFTY WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE COMPROMISE MID MIDWAY. SAY WASN'T. FULLY THE FUNDING D. E. S. THE BOARD. BUT ACTUALLY GIVE THEM SOMEWHAT OF A FEAT AND ALSO GIVING US A BIT OF A- A BREAK TO OUR OUR- THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SIR I WILL SAY THIS I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN INACTIVE STATUS WHEN YOU HAVE A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL OR SOMEBODY IN AN OCCUPATION SO THAT THEY CAN. TAKE A BREAK OR DO SOMETHING ELSE WITHOUT. FORFEITING OR RELINQUISHING THEIR LICENSE AND THEN HAVING TO START THE PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN WHETHER IT'S TAKING OF THE MEDICAL BOARD EXAMS OR TAKING A LOOK OF STATE BAR EXAM OR AN ACCOUNTANCY BATTERY OF ACCOUNTANCY EXAMS I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE AN ACTIVE STATUS TO SET THE FEES. UP PROPERLY AND I SUSPECT IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SO I WOULD JOIN- MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR PAN AND ASKING YOU TO TAKE A- CLOSER LOOK AT THIS SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY- HI I HAVE TO ALSO SAY I WAS. SINGULARLY UNIMPRESSED. WITH THE BOARD OR BOARDS THAT SAY THEY HAVE TO CHARGE THE INACTIVE. LICENSEE THE SAME FEE AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH AN ACTIVE LICENSE SINCE IN ACTIVE STATUS MEANS YOU ARE NOT USING YOUR LICENSE. HENCE THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY. BY ITS VERY NATURE MUST BE. PRETTY LIMP LIMITED SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS AGAIN SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TO TRY TO. TO MAKE THIS A BIT MORE PERFECT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING HERE WE DO THAT'S PERFECT. WE HAVE A MOTION ON SENATE BILL TEN THIRTY ONE'S CENTER ARCH WHAT IS MOVE THE BILL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS REFERRED THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS MADAM STAFF DIRECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATE BILL TEN THIRTY ONE DO YOU PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS RALPH.

MAN I KNEW MAN NEWMAN I'D SHOW A BOGUS I'M A SHOW ABOUT A GUY PM HAND I. BILL HAS THIRTEEN VOTES. THE CLOSER ROLE IN THIS BILL THE BILL IS OUT. SENATOR BOOKER ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SENATE BILL FOURTEEN ZERO SEVEN. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. I THIS IS A BIPARTISAN BILL AND IT WOULD ESTABLISH A DEDICATED HUB WITHIN COPE IS TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP. ASSIST ALL TYPES OF BUSINESS OWNERS IN NAVIGATING RESOURCES FUNDING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR DISPARAGE THE EXISTING BUSINESS STARTUP IN TRANSITION PROCESS EMPLOYEE OWNED BUSINESSES COMMONLY FORMED AS HE STOPS EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS. AN WORKER CO OPS HAVE PROVEN BENEFITS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY GENERATE MORE JOBS PER YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ABSOLUTELY OWNERSHIP IN THE LAY PEOPLE OFF AT FAR LOWER RATES AFFECT EMPLOYER BUSINESSES WERE FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO RETAIN EMPLOYEES DURING THEIR- THIS IS THE WORST OF THIS RECENT PANDEMIC. AS IN OTHER RECESSIONS. THE RIGHT QUALITY JOBS A VOICE IN THE WORKPLACE AND FOR EACH STOPS ROUGHLY THREE TIMES THE RETIREMENT ASSETS. AS COMPARED TO A NON STOP COMPANIES FOR MORE EQUITABLY IN TERMS OF RACE GENDER ECONOMIC STATUS- THAN OTHER. PLANS UNFORTUNATELY FEW ADVISORS LENDERS STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND BUSINESS OWNERS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE TOPIC. EVEN PRESIDENT REAGAN IN THE EIGHTIES SAID EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP IS THE FUTURE OF FREE PEOPLE. BUT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES FACE INTO A CRISIS BOTH THE LINGERING EFFECTS OF THE SHUTDOWN AND THE SILVER TSUNAMI WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. THE DEBATE THESE ARE BABY BUSINESS SRGB BOOMER BUSINESS OWNERS WER AT OR NEAR RETIREMENT AGE WHO OWN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOYING ALMOST FOUR MILLION PEOPLE. A SHOCKING 85% OF BUSINESS OWNERS DO NOT HAVE SUCCESSION PLANS MANY MANY COMPANIES MAKE CLOSE OR SELL A NON LOCAL BUYERS. WHO ALSO COULD RELOCATE AND CUT JOBS. WE TAKE A BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER STATES THAT HAVE DONE THIS COLORADO FOR EXAMPLE HAS RECENTLY CREATED. AN OFFICE OF EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP. AND SOME CITIES HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB. A COALITION OF SUPPORT INCLUDING DOZENS OF CALIFORNIA SHOPS AND WORKER QUOTE COOPS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. AND THREE GHOSTBUSTERS SPONSORS THE WORK COALITION. RAJIT EQUITY AND OWNERSHIP AMERICA MI FOUR CO AUTHORS CENTERS AT FORTINO PORGES OR TROUBLED AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING- OVER SIXTY BUSINESSES AN AVERAGE STUDENT ADVERTISEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THERE'S NO OPPOSITION WE'VE BEEN REGULARLY IN COMMUNITY- COMMUNICATION WITH GO BIZ. CAL O. S. P. A. AND THE FOREIGN FINANCE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WITH. TWO SPEAKERS ONLINE WHO SHOULD BE READY. THANK YOU SENATOR MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF- AS YOU KNOW YOU YOU H. W. AND PROJECT EQUITY YES HERE TO TESTIFY. PLEASE PROCEED GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRIN MEMBERS MY NAME IS REQUESTED HELLO I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT S. C. I. U. U. H. W. WEST HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN OH SEVEN S. CI U. U. H. W. IS A LABOR UNION OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE WORKERS PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS. OUR MEMBERS ARE FRONTLINE CAREGIVERS INCLUDING RESPIRATORY CARE PRACTITIONERS DIETARY ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES AND NURSING STAFF WHO AIM TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BY PROVIDING QUALITY CARE FOR ALL PATIENTS EXPANDING ACCESS TO EXCELLENT AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND IMPROVING LIVING STANDARDS FOR ALL WORKERS. WE'RE VERY PROUD MEMBER OF THE WORKER OWN RECOVERY CALIFORNIA COALITION ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. THE COALITION IS COMPRISED OF STATE AND NATIONAL EXPERTS ON WORKER OWNERSHIP. WORKER OWNED BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZED LABOR. WE CAME TOGETHER IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY KNOWING THE EXISTING PRESSURES FROM THE SILVER TSUNAMI OF BABY BOOMER BUSINESS OWNERS. WHO ARE AT OR NEAR RETIREMENT AGE WOULD ONLY BE FURTHER COMPOUNDED DUE TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. EVEN BEFORE COVERT THERE WERE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES AT RISK OF CLOSURE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THE OWNER IS NEARING RETIREMENT AND LACKS A SUCCESSION PLAN. THESE ARE NOT BUSINESSES CLOSING DUE TO UNDER PERFORMANCE. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES WILL CLOSE ALL TOGETHER OR SELL TO NON LOCAL BUYERS WHO ARE LIKELY TO RELOCATE OR CUT JOBS. THIS WOULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT BY ELIMINATING JOBS THAT WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES DEPEND ON. ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY REMOVING FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE POOR SERVICES AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY PROVEN TO BE RESILIENT BUSINESS MODELS THAT PROVIDE BETTER PAY AND BENEFITS. ASSET BUILDING THROUGH PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND SHARED BUSINESS OWNERSHIP ENHANCED JOB SECURITY STABILITY AND WELLBEING FOR WORKERS. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN THE RECENT PANDEMIC WORKER OWNED BUSINESSES WERE LESS LIKELY TO LAY OFF WORKERS AND WERE ABLE TO RECOVER MORE QUICKLY THAN THEIR TRADITIONAL BUSINESS COUNTERPARTS. WE SEE THESE MODELS ESPECIALLY COOPERATIVES AS INCREDIBLE PATHWAYS TO HELPING CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE ECONOMY. AND STRENGTHEN WORKER VOICE ESPECIALLY FOR UNDERPAID WORKERS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. SB FORTINO SEVEN ESTABLISHES THE NECESSARY FRAMEWORK TO HELP EXPAND WORKER OWNERSHIP. AND FURTHER THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO PROACTIVELY RETAIN BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT THE FUTURES OF WORKING PEOPLE. MOST GOVERNMENT SERVICES ARE DESIGNED EITHER TO SERVE A BUSINESS OWNER OR ENTREPRENEUR OR WORKERS. HAVING A CENTRALIZED HUB WITHIN THE STATE GOVERNMENT CAN BRING SAT TOGETHER THESE PARADIGMS. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR WORKER OWNERSHIP ISN'T NOVEL THE FEDERAL MAINSTREET EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP ACT WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MANDATING THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT WORKER OWNERSHIP. PROMPTING NEW AND CONTINUED SUPPORT IN A NUMBER OF STATES INCLUDING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. MAKING ORDERS OUT OF EMPLOYEES FITS THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF CALIFORNIA THE WORKER CENTERED VISION OF ORGANIZED LABOR. AND BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY FIT FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE- I VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HILLARY A BELL CO FOUNDER AND CHIEF POLICY AND IMPACT OFFICER PROJECT EQUITY. WE ARE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT BASED IN OAKLAND WITH A MISSION TO INCREASE ECONOMIC RESILIENCY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THROUGH EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP. OUR WORK INCLUDES EDUCATING BUSINESS OWNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS PARTNERING WITH DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASISTANCE TO HELP SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES TRANSITION TO EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP INCLUDING BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THE NEW EMPLOYEE OWNERS. WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORED SB FORTINO SEVEN. DURING MY TWENTY YEARS IN THIS FIELD I'VE SEEN EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP CREATE TRANSFORMATIVE BENEFITS FOR SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST DISADVANTAGED AND ESSENTIAL WORKERS. FOR EXAMPLE SERRA VEGAS IS A SINGLE MOM IN UNION CITY WHO BECAME A CO OWNER OF THE BAKERY WHERE SHE WORKS. HER FIRST PROFIT SCHERING CHECK INCREASED HER ANNUAL EARNINGS BY MORE THAN 20% AND BECAME THE FIRST MISTAKE THAT SHE AND HER SON EVER HAD. ALMOST FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIKE SERRA WORKING COMPANIES THERE THAT ARE AT RISK SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR OWNER IS AT RETIREMENT AGE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT MANY BUSINESS OWNERS ALREADY KNOW ABOUT AIR WHO CAN CARRY ON THEIR LEGACY AND KEEP JOBS IN PLACE. THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES. I CAN TELL YOU DOZENS OF SUCCESS STORIES OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES LIKE SERRA'S THAT WILL THRIVE FOR YEARS TO COME BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW EMPLOYEE OWNED. BUT WE NEED THOUSANDS OF THESE STORIES NOT DOZENS. I URGE THE STATE TO INVEST IN SCALING THIS WELL PROVEN BUT UNDER UTILIZED APPROACH TO ECONOMIC INCLUSION AND COMPETITIVENESS. I'VE AUTHORED MANY REPORTS ON THE TOPIC INCLUDING THE CASE FOR EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP WHICH COMPILES DECADES OF RESEARCH ON ITS BENEFITS. BOTH IN WORKER COOPERATIVES AND COMPANIES THAT ARE MAJORITY OWNED BY EAST TOPS. SENATOR BECKER SPOKE VERY WELL TO THOSE MANY BENEFITS SO I WON'T REPEAT THEM- SEVEN CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES IN SEVERAL STATES HAVE RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF BUSINESS RETENTION AND THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP. AND HAVE DEPLOYED THE STRATEGIES WE ARE ASKING THE STATE TO SCALE UP THROUGH SP FORTINO SEVEN. FUNDING EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP EDUCATION AND SUBSIDIZING FEASIBILITY STUDY ASSESSMENTS. S. B. FORTINO SEVEN ALSO MAKE CALIFORNIA A NATIONAL LEADER IN THE FIELD OF EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP BY TAKING THE ESSENTIAL STEP OF CREATING A CENTRAL HUB WITHIN GOLD IS.
