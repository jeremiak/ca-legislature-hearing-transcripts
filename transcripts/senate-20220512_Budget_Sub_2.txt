OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH WILL LEAD OFF THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING- PLEASE PROCEED. HI GOOD MORNING CHAIR- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS AMANDA HANSEN AND I SERVE AS THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. YES I'M ON THE PLEASE PROCEED THE PRESENTATION MY COLLEAGUE NEW ATARI KEY- IT'S GOING TO JUST INTRODUCE HERSELF BRIEFLY IF SHE'S ABLE TO. NO ONE TARA GOOD MORNING LOW GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE I'M DOING PARK HE'D DEFINITELY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AND- GET JOIN HERE TO PRESENT ON THIS. TOMORROW THANKS THANK YOU AT. FOR THE INVITATION TO PRESENT ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION EXTREME HEAT SATISFIED. I'M GOING TO PROVIDE THE VERY BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE IMPACT OF EXTREME HEAT IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION FUNDING PROPOSAL% WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN AND THEN YOU ENTIRE IS GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE SENATE SIDE PROPOSAL ITSELF. SO BEST AVAILABLE CLIMATE SCIENCE PROJECTS THAT EXTREME HEAT WILL IMPACT EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE. AND POSE RISKS TO EVERY REGION AND EVERY SECTOR. EXTREME HE THREATENS CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES. NATURAL SYSTEMS AND OUR ECONOMY AND ALSO PERHAPS IT ALSO POSES PROFOUNDLY DISPROPORTIONATE CONSEQUENCES. FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US. LAST YEAR WE EXPERIENCED THE HOTTEST SUMMER ON RECORD. WITH DEATH VALLEY SETTING AND FORTUNATE WORLD RECORD FOR THE HOTTEST MEASURE TEMPERATURE IN HISTORY. IN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DEGREES IN JULY. AND FRESNO SAW OVER SIXTY DAYS ABOVE ONE HUNDRED DEGREES. THE DAILY MAXIMUM AVERAGE TEMPERATURE WHICH IS AN INDICATOR IT'S AN INDICATOR OF EXTREME TEMPERATURE SHIPS IS EXPECTED TO RISE BETWEEN FOUR POINT FOUR AND FIVE POINT EIGHT DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BY TWENTY FIFTY AND FIVE POINT SIX AND EIGHT POINT EIGHT DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. BY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN WAS DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE STATE'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE UPDATE TO CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION STRATEGY IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR AN UPDATED. INTEGRATED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING EXTREME HEAT. IT OUTLINES CALIFORNIA'S ALL OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO MITIGATING THE HEALTH ECONOMIC CULTURAL ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF INCREASING TEMPERATURES AND HEATWAVES. THE ACTIONS IN THE PLANS WERE DEVELOPED AND REFINED BY OVER FIFTY STATE ENTITIES AND THROUGH EXTENSIVE PUBLIC INPUT OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR. THAT PUBLIC INPUT REALLY HELPED US ORGANIZE THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN AROUND FOR. ACTION TRACKED IDENTIFIED BY OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH FOLKS ACROSS THE STATE IS VERY IMPORTANT OR- BEING AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR STATE ACTION AND ENGAGEMENT THE FIRST IS BUILDING PUBLIC AWARENESS THE NOTIFICATION TO INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF HEAT STRESS AND- BETTER PREPARED FOR EXTREME HEAT EVENTS. THE SECOND IS STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY SERVICES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASE COMMUNITY CAPACITY REDUCE ECONOMIC RISKS AND INCREASED PROTECTIONS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THE THIRD AREA OF FOCUS IS INCREASING THE RESILIENCE OF OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT TO REDUCE HEAT RESTS IN THE TRANSPORTATION ENERGY BUILDING SECTORS. SIX SORRY OKAY THANKS THE BOARD IN THE FOURTH AND FINAL ACTION KILLER IS UTILIZING NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS TO CORACLE COMMUNITIES AND BUILD THE RESILIENCE OF OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS TO INCREASING TEMPERATURES. SO THE EXTREMELY ACTION PLAN IDENTIFIES SIX AREAS OF NEAR TERM FOCUS WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROPOSALS INCLUDING THE EXTREME HE SAYS I PROPOSAL THAT YOU ENTIRE IS GOING TO. WALK THROUGH NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF MODERN AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE I KNEW WHEN PARKEY DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE RESEARCH SO THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION SET ASIDE EXTREME HEAT SATISFIED INCLUDE PROGRAMS FROM SEVEN STATES AND CITIES ACROSS THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE ABOUT DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. AND THE PROPOSED FUNDING PROGRAMS ARE ORGANIZED ACROSS FOUR CATEGORIES THE FIRST INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION TO ACCELERATE READINESS AND PROTECTION OF COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY EXTREME HEAT INCLUDING THROUGH COOLING SCHOOLS SUPPORTING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS AND EXPANDING NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS THIS INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION THE CALIFORNIA TO CALL SCHOOLS WORKING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHERS TO FOCUS THE URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM GRANT FUNDS TOWARDS THE GREENING OF SCHOOL OF SCHOOL YARDS. THIS CATEGORY ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION TO THE STRATEGIC PROGRAMS OFFICE SUPPORT COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO COMMUNITY SEEKING TO BUILD OR UPGRADE EXISTING BUILDINGS AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING COMMUNITY. LEVEL SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SECOND CABIN INCLUDING THIS- EXTREMELY SATISFIED INCLUDES FORTY THREE ONE MILLION TO PROTECT BOTH POPULATIONS AND GOES FROM SIX HEAT PRESS. THIS FUNDING TO ENHANCE PROTECTIONS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING WORKERS IN HIGH RISK INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUALS AND LICENSED CARE FACILITIES. I'M RESPONDING TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION IS PROPOSED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH HELLO OSHA AND WILL BUILD UPON AND EXPAND ITS TARGETED OUTREACH AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES. THIS WILL BE COUPLED WITH TARGETED ENFORCEMENT BEFORE AND DURING PERIODS OF HIGH REST. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS SECTION IS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH BRANCH TO CONDUCT OUTREACH TO EMPLOYERS TO INFORM THEM ABOUT EXTREME HEAT RESTS IN INDOOR AND OUTDOOR SETTINGS. ALSO IS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION COMPOSED OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY TO PROVIDE OUTREACH OVERSIGHT AND EDUCATION AND TRAINING ABOUT EXTREME HEAT AND IT'S A FACT. TO SURVEYORS OF LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND LAST IN THIS CATEGORY IS EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE TARGETED INFORMATION TO PREVENT HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES BIRDS LICENSE RESIDENTIAL AND CHILD CARE FACILITIES THAT LACK THE RESOURCES TO ADEQUATELY. PREVENT IMPACTS. ALSO THIS. GOING TO THE FINAL TO BRING I'M NOT AND WORKING LANDS SYSTEMS AND BIODIVERSITY THERE IS A PROPOSED FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. TO SUPPORT SMALL UNDERSERVED FARMERS AND LARGE DISADVANTAGED URBAN CENTERS THROUGH INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OUTREACH. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT INVESTMENTS IN PILOT PROJECTS INITIATED BY COLLECTION CENTERS RENDERERS AM COMPOSTERS TO HANDLE UNEXPECTED ANIMAL MORTALITY DUE TO EXTREME HEAT AS WELL AS PROVIDE ORIGIN INSPECTION SERVICES. TO ENSURE THAT PASSED THAT MAKE PRIVATE UNDER INCREASED HE CONDITIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM ENTERING THE STATE. MOVING TO THE THIRD CATEGORY THERE'S A PROPOSED TWENTY MILLION INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS TO REDUCE STRESS MOST BY A STRING HE- THIS FUNDING PROPOSAL BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH REQUEST TWENTY MILLION TO DELIVER THIS PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. WITH KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDE ENGAGING A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. THIS CAMPAIGN WILL INCLUDE DEVELOPING TAILORED AWARENESS MATERIALS AND WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MEDIA SPECIALIZING IN IN LANGUAGE AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT CONTENT. AND FINALLY THE CATEGORY IN THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE SEVENTEEN MILLION TO EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND BUILD A CLIMATE SMART WORKFORCE YOU CAN OPERATE UNDER INTO DRASTIC STREET. WITH FUNDING TO GO TOWARDS THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD WHICH REQUEST SEVENTEEN MILLION FOR DEVELOP AND EXPAND MORE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT. AND THE MORTAL PARTNER WITH RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES TO EXPAND ITS CURRENT FOCAL PROJECTS IDENTIFIED TECHNOLOGIES INNOVATIONS AND INDUSTRIES THAT ADDRESS AND MITIGATE EXTREME HEAT. WELL CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND CREATE PARTNERSHIPS TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN WORKFORCE FOR THESE EMERGING ROLES. WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE- TO BE HERE AND HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTION THANK YOU. OKAY IS. AN THE WE HAVE A LOT OF A AGENTS- DEPARTMENT. REGULATIONS PUBLIC HEALTH. CAL OUR- PARTNER BAG ANYBODY ELSE HAS SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT 2% OR IF YOU'RE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY LET'S GO TO THE L. A. L. IS THIS A ROOF WE PURGING. DOZENS OF AGENCIES AND ENTITIES HAVE PUT TOGETHER THIS PLAN HOWEVER- WE HAVE A QUESTION ON THE COHESIVENESS OF THE STRATEGY. ONCE YOU GO AHEAD- MISTER. THE YOU MISTER AND HE'S WARNING GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CHAIR- EUNICE ROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO TODAY WE HAVE SOME INITIAL COMMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THAT PROPOSED PACKAGE- SO OVERALL WE FIND THAT THE PACKAGE IS COMPRISED OF A DIVERSE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES- INTENDED TO ADDRESS EXTREME HE S. YEARS RANGING CM DIRECT INTERVENTIONS FOR HEAT RELIEF. TO EDUCATION AND OUTREACH FOR EXTREME HEAT AWARENESS- HOWEVER WHILE SOME OF THESE IN THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES- MAY HAVE MERIT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE PROPOSALS ADDRESS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EXTREME HEAT AND WHETHER THIS COMBINATION OF PROPOSALS. IS THE MOST STRATEGIC WAY TO ADDRESS SUCH PRIORITIES. THIS PACKAGE IS INTENDED TO ALIGN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S- RECENTLY FINALIZED EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN WHICH DOES INCLUDE- SEVERAL GOALS. BUT BECAUSE THE AND PLAN LACKS A CLEAR STRATEGY AND MEASURABLE GOALS IT'S DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROPOSED PACKAGE IS THE BEST APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE MOST PRESSING CONCERNS RELATED TO EXTREME HEAT. AND IN ADDITION- WE FIND THAT- IF THE FUNDS A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THE PACKAGE IS LIMITED IN SOME IMPORTANT AREAS SUCH AS- DIRECT HEAT REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS AND RESEARCH. SO FIRST WITH RESPECT TO ADD DIRECT HEAT REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS THE PACKAGE IS NOT INCLUDE SOME CRITICAL TYPES OF BUILDING LEVEL INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS AIR CONDITIONING INSTALLATIONS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR DAYS SUCH AS- HOMES WORKPLACES AND SCHOOLS AND THESE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS COULD PROVIDE DIRECT. DIRECT RELIEF FROM EXTREME HEAT ESPECIALLY FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MODIFY THEIR SURROUNDINGS WITH ADDITIONAL ANSWERS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. AND SECOND- I AM. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR RESEARCH MIGHT BE WORN TED- JUST BECAUSE MUCH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY REMAINS ABOUT WHICH POLICY INTERVENTIONS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE AT IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT. FURTHER RESEARCH WHICH COULD INCLUDE A PILOT PROGRAMS AND EVALUATIONS- COULD HELP PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION SUCH AS WHICH ACTIVITIES ARE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS EXTREMELY AND WHICH PROGRAMS ARE BEST SUITED AT SERVING THE MOST VULNERABLE. THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER WHICH TYPES OF ACTIVITIES ARE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR A ONE TIE FUNDING. SOME TYPES OF ACTIVITIES ARE- JUST MORE NATURALLY PROGRAM FOR A ONE TIME FUNDING THAN OTHERS SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS PILOT PROGRAMS- AS WELL AS RESEARCH BECAUSE THE BENEFITS OF THESE ACTIVITIES REMAIN AFTER THE FUNDING ENDS. SO FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE FUNDING FOR- TO GREENING SCHOOLYARDS AND STUDENTS TEACHERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS COULD CONTINUE BENEFITING FROM MORE TREES AND SHADE AND THEIR SCHOOLYARDS IN TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS- WELL BEYOND THE FUNDING PERIOD. IN CONTRAST I'M USING ONE TIME FUNDS FOR LIMITED TERM STAFFING AND SERVICES MIGHT BE LESS EFFECTIVE. BECAUSE THEY WOULD ONLY PROVIDE BENEFITS DURING THE FUNDING PERIOD FO INSTANCE- THE PROPOSED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER CAL OSHA LIKELY WOULD NEED TO BE CONDUCTED ON THE ONGOING BASIS TO BE YOUR MOST EFFECTIVE. I'M ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER THIS THE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OR STYLE AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PACKAGE IS CONSIDERED EXCLUDABLE FROM SOUTH BY ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT SO GIVEN. THAT STYLE WILL CONTINUE TO CONSTRAIN THE STATE'S BUDGET OPTIONS THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER SHIFTING MORE FUNDING TO ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE EXCLUDABLE AFRISAM. AM WE ALSO NOTE THAT AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES SOME OTHER EXTREME HEAT I AM RELATED PROPOSALS OUTSIDE OF THIS PACKAGE SO FOR EXAMPLE. AND THE BUDGET INCLUDES AN TEN MILLION FOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE REAL TIME DATA AND THE HELL HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH INCLUDES INCLUDING EXTREME HERE- AND IN ADDITION- THERE IS THAT FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED LAST YEAR IN LAST YEAR'S I CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE FOR EXTREME HE ACTIVITIES AS WELL SO. THE LEGISLATURE MADE I JUST WANT TO CONSIDER THE FUNDING PROVIDED FOR ALL RELEVANT HERE RELATED ACTIVITIES- THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET AND BUT THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR TO ENSURE. ITS APPROACH OF STRATEGIC COMPREHENSIVE AND NOT DUPLICATIVE. AND FINALLY- THE PROPOSED PACKAGE DOES NOT INCLUDE A PLAN THAT TO REPORT ON THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE ACHIEVED THAT THE FUNDING. AND WE FIND THAT THE ROBUST REPORTING WENT TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE CONDUCT PROPER OVERSIGHT AND ALSO HELP. INFORM FUTURE POLICY AND FUNDING DECISIONS REGARDING EXTREME HEAT STRATEGIES. AND SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS SO FROM HELP. HELP ME OUT ON THE BALANCE BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS EXTREME HEAT- CHALLENGE AND A LOT OF THIS THERE'S A CHOICES THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE A PUBLIC POLICY OF DO WE- FOCUS ON THE CAUSES OF. EXTREME HEAT AND TRYING TO REDUCE THOSE OR WE DEALING WITH THE SYMPTOMS- WITH EXTREME HEAT- THAT WE HAVE OUT POINT OUT ON THAT THE COOLING COMMUNITIES IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE SCHOOL YARD URBAN FORESTRY. WHILE IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR THE TREES TO GROW WOULD CREATE AND- A LONG TERM. INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES- AND THE NATURAL WAY TO. DEAL WITH THE HEATING VERSUS PUTTING AN AIR CONDITIONER IN A HOUSE WHILE IT MAY HELP OUT THE PERSON IMMEDIATELY IS SORT OF THIS WE'RE JUST DEALING WITH THE SYMPTOMS STILL GONNA GET HOT OUTSIDE YOU THE AREA OUTSIDE IS HOT. DO YOU UNBALANCE THE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. IS MORE ON REACTION TO THE SYMPTOMS AND THERE IS TO THE HELPING WITH THE GENERAL COOLING. IS THAT YOUR OBSERVATION ARE. HE SAID THIS AT CLEAR WHAT THE ACTION IS- I THINK SO I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW THERE THERE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE A BALANCE ALSO BETWEEN KIND AND NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS LIKE YOU'RE REFERENCING KIND OF TREES AND- KIND OF MORE OF THAT KIND OF YEAH MORE TREES TO PROVIDE MORE SHADE AND- COMMITTEE SETTINGS SUCH AS SCHOOLS BIRTH IS ALSO- AND- MORE THINGS THE MORE LIKE ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS OR AIR CONDITIONING UNITS. THAT COULD COOL- AND BUILDINGS SO AND I THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EXTREME HE IS INEVITABLE SO I DO THINK SOME OF THE SHORT TERM INTERVENTIONS TO DIRECTLY PROVIDE RELIEF IS REALLY IMPORTANT I'M BUT AS YOU SAID IT IT DOES HAVE TO KIND OF BALANCE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER CLIMATE MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT. THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALSO BEEN ADDED CONSIDERING AND OTHER OTHER PACKAGES AND UP AFTER AT THE OTHER SO THE REST SO MY READ OF THE- WITH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WITH THE RESILIENCY CENTERS IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT LIBRARIES. COMMUNITY CENTERS. CAN FAIRS PLACES WERE WERE PEOPLE CONGREGATE AND THEN PUTTING IN AIR CONDITIONING AND OR PUTTING IN. SOMETHING THAT WOULD CREATE A- A COOLER ENVIRONMENT IS SERVICE- THIS IS NECESSARILY GOING INTO INDIVIDUAL HOMES IN GIVING SOMEBODY AN AT AN AIR CONDITIONING UNIT IS THAT YOUR READ ON IT IS IT IS THAT THEY WOULD BE YOU KNOW WE TRY TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK FOR THIS HUNDRED AND SEVENTY. MILLION DOLLARS IN THESE AREAS THAT ARE GONNA BE AFFECTED AND THAT. IT'S IT IT'S AN EXISTING. CENTER THAT'S COULD BE TURNED INTO A COOLING CENTER I GUESS I SHOULD SAY. OR YOU DO NOT READ IT THAT WAY. BEFORE I GET TO THAT. THE GROWTH COUNCIL ON OPR ON IT. YES ANSWERED DEMONSTRATION MAY WANT TO BUY ANSWER THIS QUESTION AS WELL BY YES MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AS THE FUNDING COULD BE USED TOWARDS SOME BUILDING LEVEL IMPROVEMENTS WHICH COULD INCLUDE AND SOME COOLING OR EFFICIENCY UPGRADES AND- DAD'S AT. SO IT COULD YOU KNOW. AND BENEFIT MORE INDIVIDUALS THAN I GUESS AT ADDRESSING AT A PRIVATE RESIDENCE LEVEL. FINANCE OF YOUR RESOURCES'S ANYBODY WANT TICKET CLARIFICATION OR A- AUGMENTATION OF WHAT THE PLAN IS. YEAH MRS NEWMAN PARTIES FROM OPR I WILL- JUST OFFER A QUICK- RESPONSE HERE AND THEN- I WILL TURN IT OVER O MY COLLEAGUES AT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL IF THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE RESILIENCE CENTERS COMPONENT OF YOUR QUESTION I'M IN FRONT OF THEIR- BEFORE I DO THOUGH I WANTED TO I'M- GOING TO YOU KNOW TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR AROUND KIND OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF INVESTMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENTS LOOKING AT REDUCING. THE IMPACTS AND THEN- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW COMPLIMENTED INVESTMENTS ON ADDRESSING THE SYMPTOMS DID TO YOUR POINT I WOULD ALSO POINT TO THE FUNDING THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CLIMATE BUDGET THAT DOES AT- ON AUGMENT SOME OF THOSE REDUCING THE IMMEDIATE IMPACTS INCLUDING FUNDING TO THE RESPONSES AGENCIES FOR. URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY INTERPRETIVE READING PROGRAMS AND THEN THE HUNDRED MILLION FOR A NEW COMMUNITY RESILIENCE IN EXTREME HEAT PROGRAM THAT ILL BE AT OPR THAT WILL BE AT THE STANDING UP IN THIS COMING BUDGET YEAR THAT WILL ALSO DEDICATE RESOURCES TO SOME OF THOSE HEAT EDUCATION ACTIVITIES THAT YOU MENTIONED SO JUST. NOTING THAT. WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THREE HUNDRED MILLION SEVENTY. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL. ON PROPOSAL ARE OFFENDING RATHER FROM LAST YEAR ARE IN COMPLIMENTS YOU THE FUNNY FOR QUITE SOME BESIDE. IN OUR ITSELF I'D RATHER SO I'M MAKING A POINT THEN I WILL SEE MY CAR FROM STRAY PETERSBURG COUNCIL HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL POINT ON THE WRIST. CENTERS OKAY AND THEN WE'LL GET TO- ALEJO. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH IN RETURN THANK YOU SENATORS I JUST WANTED TO VERY QUICKLY- EMPHASIZE THAT THE UPGRADES MADE TO RESILIENCE CENTERS BUT ALSO INCLUDE. AND ENERGY RETROFITS AND OTHER NECESSARY MEASURES TO HAVE KIND OF. LOW EMISSIONS OR- SOMEONE MEDICATION MEASURES EMBEDDED INTO IT SO THAT THE CENTERS WOULDN'T BE. I'M DEVELOPING NECESSARILY ADDITIONAL EMISSIONS SO THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY WE'D BE PART OF THE PROGRAM DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL SO YOU YOU YOU YOU GOT AN OLD WRECK BUILDING AND YOU'RE GOING TO. POP OUT THE SINGLE PANE WINDOWS YOU GO TO INSULATE THE SIDES YOU COULD PUT IN A I HAD. M. HM SYSTEM N. N. AND SOME CHAIRS FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN WHEN IT'S EXTREME HEAT I MEAN IT'S AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION BUT BUT THAT TYPE OF BUILDING THAT'S ENERGY INEFFICIENCY THAT DOESN'T CORRECT CREATE A COOLING CENTER THAT'S- CONTRA GO TO NOW ALIVE OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY SO MY SELLERS AT THE ALEJO. MORNING RETAILERS WITH THE L. OUT JUST ONE CONSIDERATION TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION AND AS YOU ALL ARE THINKING ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER A PACKAGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE FACING TWO CHALLENGES AROUND THE HEAT. AB ROUND ONE IS THESE EXTREME HEAT EVENTS WHERE IT'S REALLY REALLY HOT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE NEED PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO BE SAFE. BUT THERE'S ALSO AND IN PARTICULAR IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE WILL WE'RE GONNA JUST HAVE SUSTAINED DAYS OF MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURES WHERE IT'S NOT KIND OF A ONE OR TWO OR THREE DAY ISSUE IT'S MORE OF A LIKE. ALSO KIND OF ISSUE WHERE. THEY MAY NOT BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE OUT OF THEIR HOME FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHEN THEY HAVE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY HAVE PETS WHEN YOU KNOW THAT AS AS PART OF THEIR KIND OF EVERY DAY LIFE. THEY'RE GOING TO D. CAMP SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT HAS- A COOLER TEMPERATURE AND SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE BALLOTS TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW SPENDING PACKAGES HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THESE SORT OF. AB IT DIDN'T KIND OF DUAL CHALLENGES ONE ISN'T REALLY EXTREME HEAT WHERE YOU MAY SAY OKAY WE GOT IT WE GOT A MOBILE PEOPLE AND GET THEM SOMEWHERE SAFE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. VERSES ALSO THINKING ABOUT AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE- IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY A LOT HARDER FOR SUSTAINED PERIODS OF TIME AND HOW DO WE ENSURE WORKERS ARE SAFE AND THAT KIND OF LONGER TERM AREA RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE RESIDENTS- SO REALLY AS YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR RESPONSES. KEEPING IN MIND THAT THERE ARE- KIND OF THESE TWO DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. THAT BOTH ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. OF MISS COACH OF. OUR VON. LEE WITH STREET STRATEGIC GROWTH CAL- WHAT DO YOU SAY ISIS ED AN INCIDENT OF EXTREME HEAT OR SUSTAIN SUCH- HE'D. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EXECUTAR THIS DROUGHT COUNCIL ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER ABOUT THAT COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTER SAYS THE WAY THAT THEIR STRUCTURE IS BOLD WAS THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE IN EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS SO AS AS A COOLING CENTERS BUT MENTION BUT ALSO AS A PLACE ON AN ONGOING BASIS FOR COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON RESILIENCY PLANNING TO GAIN ACCESS AWARENESS OF ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE OFFERED THE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL. NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO PORT ST KEEP CONDITIONS ABSOLUTELY THESE ARE BOTH A LONGER TERM EXTREME DAY USAGE BUT THEN ALSO EIGHT ALWAYS PEOPLE TO HELP BUILD THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY APRICUS WILL BE ABLE TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL BE ABLE TO PREPARE THE STATE EXTREME CONDITIONS AND I PRESUME THAT'S PART OF THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU WON OVER TWO YEARS FOR THE PUBLIC AWARENESS. CAMPAIGN. INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS. SO I WOULD I WOULD ASK YOU TARA TO COMMENT ON. ALSO THEN. BUT THE- THE ALLEN ARE. THE AB ONE AND SEVENTY MILLION WITH RESILIENCY CENTER. BUILT INTO STRUCTURES ARE THE TACTIC ASSISTANCE THE DS. TO MAKE THESE RESULTS SAID ALSO FOR COMMUNITY IN SUPPORT SO IT'S NOT A FIELD IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME. GOING TO OUT TO ME SURE THEY KNOW IT'S THEIR- YES MISS. A MISS KEY DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING THERE. YEAH I WOULD JUST- ON THE PUBLIC AWARENESS- FUNDING PROPOSED TO COME TO- PR YOU KNOW THAT IS VERY MUCH IN RESPONSE TO THE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INPUT FOLDER IMPORT WE GOT WHILE DEVELOPING THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN WAS REALLY THAT THE RECOGNITION THAT COMMUNITIES AND ALSO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE NEEDS SUPPORT IN BUILDING. AWARENESS AROUND THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT BEFORE THEY HAPPEN AND THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THEY'RE THE RIGHT STRUCTURES AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS WITHIN COMMUNITIES NGUYEN EXTREME HEAT EVENTS- DO OCCUR AND SO THAT FUNDING IS REALLY TARGETED THE TWENTY MILLION PROPOSALS REALLY TARGETED AT SUPPORTING BROAD COMMUNITY AWARENESS AROUND PUBLIC AWARENESS RATHER AROUND EXTREME HEAT. BEFORE AND DURING EVENTS. I HAVE A QUESTION THE GOING TO GET TO MISS THE CENTER STARTED SECOND BUT A QUESTION FOR MR AGUILERA- WE'VE GOT SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS SINGLE PANE WINDOWS. INSULATING BILL MAKING. ENERGY EFFICIENT- BUILDINGS NOTHING SPECIAL WHAT IS SPECIAL WHY WOULD WE NEED TO DO ADDITIONAL HIGH ROAD PARTNERSHIP TRAINING IN THIS PROPOSAL NOT ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET BUT WHY IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR WHAT WOULD SEEM TO ME. ORDINARY IMPROVEMENTS. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- RAFEAL AGAIN CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD APPRECIATE OPPORTUNITY HERE- SO WITH MY OUR PROGRAM THE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS WHAT WE DO IS WE SET UP PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LABOR AND MANAGEMENT. AND WORKFORCE PROFESSIONALS AND BASICALLY TRY AND LINK TO ME LABOR DEMANDS THAT ARE ON THAT AND LOOK FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE- EQUITY JOB ACCESS LINK PRE APPRENTICESHIP AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. AND SO I MEAN WHAT I THINK OUR VALUE ADD HERE IS THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY GONNA LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE FROM A MITIGATION PERSPECTIVE THE JOBS THAT ARE CREATED- BUT NOW AN ADAPTATION AND EXTREME HEAT. FRAMEWORK PERSPECTIVE AND ALL THE POTENTIAL JOBS THAT. YOU MENTIONED- YOU KNOW WILL GENERATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA BASICALLY ATTEMPT TO DO HERE IS A BRIDGE BETWEEN- YOU KNOW NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY ALL THE AGENCIES HERE. TODAY THERE ARE STRATEGIC PLANNING THEIR ADAPTATION DOCUMENTS AND OUR WORKFORCE STRATEGY AND MEETING THAT LABOR DEMANDS WHICH AS YOU KNOW- AS YOU CAN SEE IN MY BACKGROUND EVERYTHING THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA TAKE TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FACT. IS THAT I REQUIRE A REAL PERSON TO INSTALL UPGRADE MAINTAINED- THOSE THOSE ARE YOU KNOW HARDEN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS LEVERAGE THE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS TO CREATE THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENTS- ENHANCED UP QUALITY GOALS AND FOR EXAMPLE CREATE PROGRAMS THAT YOU KNOW LEAD TO PIPELINES. FOR ON JOB ACCESS AND JOB QUALITY- IN THOSE TRADES. AND MANY OF THOSE TRADES ARE TRADE BECAUSE- LIKE TRISH- LATE HOURS AND MAKE LINK I GUESS MY POINT WAS IS THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GENERICALLY WE'VE GOT TO GET PLUMBERS WE'RE GOING TO GET. A PEOPLE TRAINED TO DO IT I'M ASKING WHY THERE'S ADDITIONAL MONEY IN THIS BECAUSE IF WE TRAINED IN ANOTHER SECTION OF THE BUDGET FOR WINDOW INSTALLERS. THEY DON'T NEED SPECIAL. HOW TO BUILD. A CLIMATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO PUT IN THE WINDOW AT ONE OF THE CENTERS AND BAKERSFIELD BECAUSE THEY ALREADY KNOW HOW TO PUT THE WINDOW AND THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH I'M JUST ASKING. IS THERE SOMETHING SOME. SKILL SET THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT WOULD BE PARTICULAR FOR ANY OF THESE EDUCATION THE PUBLIC AWARENESS OR THE YOU KNOW. YEAH WELL YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE ANTICIPATE- DISCUSSING WITH OUR SKINNER A- PARTNERS AND THEY WILL BE MARRIED AND MANY OF PART IN BETWEEN. BECAUSE WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE A REGIONAL APPROACH AND THE SECTOR APPROACH THERE ARE INDUSTRIES THAT WE HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF PERHAPS- THE URBAN GREENING AND LANDSCAPING- YOU KNOW THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL CERTAINLY COME ABOUT. YOU KNOW ELECTRIFICATION SMART GRID BATTERY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES BEING INTEGRATED AND- YOU KNOW BRINGING TO BEAR THE MOST. NO AVAILABLE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ADAPT TO THOSE THINGS ISRAELI I THINK THE CALIFORNIA WAY YEAH NO I GET THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GENERICALLY AND I'M JUST SIR TRYING TO SEPARATE THIS IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS. NOT PARTICULARLY A BUILDING OR OF MAKING ENERGY EFFICIENT RESILIENCY CENTER DOES NOT AT LEAST IN ITS AT LEAST WHAT'S PRESENTED TO US I DON'T SEE ANY PARTICULAR NEW. SKILLS THAT SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO. BUT DEVELOP THEY JUST BUILT REGULAR BUILDING A REGULAR ENERGY EFFICIENCY BUILDING THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH EXTREME HEAT SET ASIDE PROGRAM THIS IS JUST I'M JUST MORE OPENING. GIVE YOU SOME CONCERNS AS WE DO HERE TO PUBLIC AT THE HEARING. ARE AMONG THE HANSON WITH THE- DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR CLIMATE. I SEE RECOGNIZE ISSUE. THANK YOU I JUST- MAYBE TODAY SIR DIRECTLY RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK. THAT YOU KNOW OUR VISION IS THAT IN MANY CASES IT IS TRUE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE CAREERS AND ADDS. EXISTING WORKFORCE ALL THE PROGRAMS WERE PERHAPS INTEGRATION OF EXTREME HEAT MAKES SENSE. THERE ARE OTHER INDUSTRIES AND CAREERS WHERE THE WORK THAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY TO DELIVER ON EXTREME HEAT IS NOT AS IT IS NOT AN EXISTING PROGRAM OR IS NOT AN EXISTING INDUSTRY OF FOCUS- SO YOU KNOW MAINTAINING ROADS WITH THE MATERIALS THAT ARE REQUIRED OR YOU KNOW. LESS HEAT ABSORBING- I'M I'M IN WORLD SO FORGIVE ME BUT THAT KIND OF MAINTENANCE THAT IS HEAT RESISTANT SAME THING WITH YOU KNOW CONSTRUCTION WITH THESE KIND OF NEW BUILDING MATERIALS. ADAM THE YOU KNOW PASSIVE. PASSIVE BUILDING CERTIFICATION. I AND THERE'S JUST SORT OF AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE GROWING IN THE FUTURE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE I THINK IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO ALSO JUST GO BACK TO THE QUESTION OF SORT OF IS THIS A BALANCED PACKAGE I DO UNDERSTAND IT'S HARD TO SEE ALL THE PIECES. TOGETHER JUST BECAUSE YU CAN SEE THERE ISN'T SOMEONE BLASTERS BUDGET THERE'S SOME IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IN JANUARY AND I THINK WE HAVE THE FUNDING ARE SET ASIDE HERE BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SORT OF POINT OUT WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS THAT THE PROPOSED IN JANUARY BUDGET. FOR PROTECTING- HAVE LOW-INCOME AT COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE IN OUR POPULATIONS THAT LIVE IN OLDER BUILDINGS THAT ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT WE HAVE FUNDING FOR LIVE WITH TO DO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KIND OF UPGRADE IN WITH THE INTENTION OF IN ENSURING THAT EXTREME HEAT IS CONSIDERED WE HAVE FUNDING FOR THE HEALTH DATA SYSTEM THAT HAS HAS COME UP HERE WE HAVE FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED BUT ALSO FUNDING FOR WORKER PROTECTIONS. AND ENFORCEMENT AND EDUCATION OUT WE ALSO HAVE THE YOU KNOW PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS OPR IS EXTREME HEAT PROGRAM AND THEN A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO AND FOR THAT THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS IN THIS. PACKAGE YEAH. AND FOR HERB GREENING AND AT. A COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM. WE HAVE AND THAT PROTECTING FISH AND WILD. FROM CHANGING CONDITIONS STREAMFLOW ENHANCEMENT- WILDLIFE CORRIDORS AND A PROGRAM TO PROTECT WILDLIFE. FROM CLIMATE IMPACTS SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF. OF PROGRAMS ACROSS THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WILL DRIVE ON YOU DON'T REDUCING THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT AND PROTECTING- OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE FUTURE TO BUILD RESILIENCE TO EXTREME HEAT SO I JUST I WANTED TO SORT OF A PROBLEM. NO I NAY AND- THAT'S I MEAN THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT THE L. A. O. HAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION IS THERE A COHESIVE STRATEGY FOR THIS THIRD PIECES HERE PIECES HERE AND WE'VE- GOT TO ADD ON THIS- I GOT A- ESTABLISHED RECORDS OF EVERY WILL FORGIVE ME. MISS ROY IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL AND TO FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING CORE. LIKE HOUSEKI HERE. WHY CASKEY HERE DOLLY. DALY ABSENT MCGUIRE YOUR ACQUIRE. STERN YOUR SISTER HAS A POINT. WE HAVE MEMBERS AND ATTEND WEBER BEEN ESTABLISHED VERY GOOD SENATE STERN YOU RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- FOR THE SAY THE OUTSET. I APPRECIATE THE PINPOINTING OF THIS. THIS ISSUE BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE GOVERNOR IN PARTICULAR I WANT EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE ON- CALLING OUT EXTREME HEAT AS- WHAT IT IS WHICH IS THE SILENT KILLER AND THE LARGEST CLIMATE IMPACT IN THE STATE THAT NO ONE'S REALLY TALKING ABOUT- WE STILL. I THINK ARE UNDERESTIMATING HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR FROM EXTREME HEAT INCIDENTS- ACTUALLY IN THEIR HOMES BUT ALSO IN STRESSES IT FROM THE WORKPLACE- ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S- THERE'S A LACK OF COOLING AT NIGHT- HEAT EXPOSURE. PRETERM BIRTHS THE LIST GOES ON- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION- HONING IN ON THIS CHALLENGE IN TRYING TO PUT. A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE TOGETHER BUT I WANTED TO BUILD ON- DEBBIE SECRETARY HANSON'S- TO FLESHING OUT THERE WHICH WHICH M. TO ME SORT OF COULD ROUND OUT THE STRATEGY- BECAUSE WHEN I READ THE ANALYSIS. STATING THAT. THE PACKAGE- DOES NOT HAVE A FUNDING FOR- BUILDING LEVEL INTERVENTIONS. SUCH AS IMPROVEMENTS OF COOLING OR ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS IN PRIVATE RESIDENCES- THAT'S CONCERNING- FOR WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS. IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT IN THE PACKAGE IS JUST NOT LISTED HERE IN THE CHART CAN WE PLEASE TO HONE IN ON THAT BECAUSE I NOTICED THAT FOR INSTANCE THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS NOT. AMONG THE CAVALCADE OF AGENCIES INVOLVED HERE TODAY IN THIS EXTREME HEAT STRATEGY AND YET THEY'LL BE THE ONES- THEY HAVE A SIX MILLION HEAT PUMP BY TWENTY THIRTY GOAL N. ARE HEADING UP THE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION STRATEGY WHICH HAS CRITICAL AREAS OF OVERLAP. I'M I'D BE REMISS THAT WE WENT AROUND AND INSTALLED A BUNCH OF GAS BASED. I'M COOLING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE THEN HAD TO. ABANDON THOSE STRANDED ASSETS ONLY MAKE TRANSITIONS AWAY FROM THE GAS SYSTEM SO CAN EITHER DEPUTY SECRETARY YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE WITHIN- WITHIN THIS THIS FRAMEWORK MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTOR KEY CAN YOU. CAN YOU FLESH OUT THOSE PIECES THAT AREN'T HERE THAT FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES- FIDELIO NOTED- DURING EXTREME HEAT EVENTS THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHO RELY ON SAY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND WALKING IS TO GO MAKE A HOUR LONG COMMUTE- WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND GOING THROUGH- YOU KNOW THE EARLY PHASES OF HEAT STROKE TO GO. TRY TO FIND THEIR WAY TO A LOCAL LIBRARY- THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SO VULNERABLE IS KEEP THEM AT HOME AND MAKE SURE THAT ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE IN RENTAL UNITS- THAT THEIR LANDLORDS ARE ENSURING THAT THEIR THEIR PLACES IS SUFFICIENTLY COOL IN THAT. THOSE BUILDINGS HAVE THE HEAT PUMP CAPACITY TO KEEP THEM COOL- SO CAN YOU CAN YOU ALSO JUST KIND OF DIGGING ON THAT FOR A SECOND EXPLAIN MAYBE WHY THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS NOT INVOLVED WITH THE EXTREME HEAT STRATEGY AND- HOW SOME OF THESE OTHER COMPONENTS YOU'D MENTION LIE WITH. HOW YOU EXPECT THOSE TO SOARED INTERFACE AT THE RESIDENTIAL LEVEL. YES SO THIS IS A NEW AND MARQUIS I WILL- RESPOND HERE AND THEN I WOULD ABSOLUTELY PARENTS THAT MY CALLING A MOTHER HANSON TO WEIGH IN AND ADD ADDITIONAL DETAIL- SO YES WE AS WE WERE PULLING TOGETHER BOTH THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN AND THEN. THIS IS A PROPOSAL FOR THE SENATE SIDE. REALLY WANTING TO TAKE. ALL OF GOVERNMENTS AND INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH RECOGNIZING THAT EVERY SECTOR AND ESPECIALLY EVERY STATE AGENCY HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN RESPONDING TO THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT ACROSS ALL THE WORK THAT WE DO SO. NOT JUST TO YOUR POINT SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE ENERGY COMMISSION THEY ABSOLUTELY WORK HE PARTNER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOTH THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN AS WELL AS A PARTNER IN OUR CONVERSATIONS AROUND. WHERE THERE IS FUNDING NEED TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE SOLUTIONS ON THE GROUND SO ENERGY COMMISSION WHILE THEY ARE NOT REFLECTED EXPLICITLY IN THIS. EXTREME HEAT SATISFIED FUNDING PROPOSAL THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS WHERE THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE ENGAGED AND INVOLVED IN SOLUTIONS AND I CAN LET MY COLLEAGUE AMANDA HANSEN. COVER ANY DETAILS THERE- WHAT WHEN I'M DONE HERE BUT- TO YOUR POINT THERE IS THAT YOU KNOW IN THE- BUILDING THAT WAS AGREED TO LAST YEAR AS PART OF THAT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION FOR EXTREME HEAT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A THREE HUNDRED MILLION SET ASIDE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. BUT THE ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED WAS AGREED TO AND PROGRAMS OUT FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR THE URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY IN URBAN GREENING PROGRAM. A HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE NEW COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND HE PROGRAM AT OPR WHICH I SPOKE TO A LITTLE BIT AND- EARLIER THERE BUT REALLY LOOKING AT THAT FUNDING. TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HE PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PLANNING AS WELL AS YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS ON THE GROUND. THERE'S A. HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE FIRST USE ABOUT THOSE I'M GOING AND JUST FELL THAT RIGHT NOW- AND THEN FIFTY MILLION THE LOWER. WHEN IT'S A PRO AS WELL SO THAT FROM THE- WILL DEPART SPECIFICALLY. IN HALL. AND NEEDS COOLING EFFICIENCY MANY THE THINGS TALKED. SO IN ADDITION TO WHAT WAS AGREED TO LAST YEAR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THIS IS ALSO SUMMARIZED THE BEGINNING OF THAT- BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION SET ASIDE IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO CONNECT THESE DOTS- THERE IS. TEN MILLION FOUR- PROPOSED FOR ON GOING TO ESTABLISH A MONITORING PROGRAM TO TRACK EMERGING INTENSIFIED CLIMATE SENSITIVE HEALTH IMPACTS AND DISEASES THROUGH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROJECT IN YOUR BUDGET. AND THEN THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION PROPOSED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REALLY TO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH PLANNING AND- FOR NATION ONLINE GOOD ACTORS ON THE GROUND. AND THEN THE LAST THING I'LL POINT OUT TO IN THAT JANUARY BUDGET IS THE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY TWO. MILLION TO SUPPORT EQUITABLE BUILDING DEEP HARPER STATEWIDE LOW INCOME DIRECT INSTALLED BUILDING RETROFIT PROGRAMS SO YEAH ALL OF TAT IS NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDED IN THIS B. C. B. FOR THAT HE SET ASIDE BUT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THAT HE SAID SCIENTISTS THREE HUNDRED MILLION. LOOKING AT WHERE FUNDING ONE TIME FUNDING WAS NEEDED TO AUGMENT THE GAPS AND WORK. IN OTHER PLACES. SHOULD YEAH YES THANKS NOT JUST TO BEFORE WE TURN TO THEM THERE SECRETARY HANSON JUST JUST TO HONE IN THEIR SO HUNDRED. FOR-RESULT CENTERS THE YOU MENTION AS PART OF THE ADDITIONAL FOR HUNDRED MILLION. THE THAT'S IN ADDITION TO SORRY THAT'S IN A TO THE SEVEN MILLION WE'RE AT HERE TODAY SO A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION THEN FOR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S JUST. THERE'S ANOTHER. OKAY SO THERE'S- TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY IS NOT REALLY THE NUMBER THE NUMBERS REALLY TWO SEVENTY- JUST TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS AND THEN THAT URBAN FORESTRY NUMBERS NOT REALLY FIFTY MILLION IT'S REALLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION IF YOU ADD ON THE ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED FROM THE- BUDGET PROPOSAL EARLIER THIS YEAR. THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT. NO BECAUSE THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THAT WAS AGREED TO LAST YEAR IS. YOU KNOW TARGETED TO A VERY BROAD SET OF- AT ENTITIES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTOOD NOT HE LOCUSTS THIS IS THE STATE FOCUSED PIECE OF THE URBAN FORESTRY STRATEGY IS THAT A FAIR WAY TO PUT IT. ACTUALLY I WOULD SAY THAT IT THEY THEY ARE OFTEN VERY HE FOCUS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT'S AN ELEMENT THAT'S LOOKED AT WHAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT. THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FIFTY MILLION IN THIS THREE HUNDRED STATUS THAT. IS THAT IT'S TARGETED PROTECTING VERY VULNERABLE SCHOOL VERY CHIC MARBLE SCHOOL UNDERSTOOD. YEAH AND THEN AND THEN ON BUT ON THE MA DESCRIBING ACCURATELY ON THE RESILIENCE CENTER PIECE THROUGH STC. IT'S IT A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION PROPOSED IN THIS EXTREME HEAT SET ASIDE BUT THEN THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL. HUNDRED MILLION. FOR THE SAME PROGRAM. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY HE ORIENTED THAT THAT SORT OF BROADER REACH YOU KNOW WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY OTHER RESILIENCE ISSUES OUT THERE BESIDES HE IS AT THE- STATE FAIR WE UNDERSTAND THAT. YEAH I WILL- GIVE AN INITIAL RESPONSE AND THEN MY COLLEAGUES FROM ST PETERSBURG CALIFORNIA ATTENDEES DO BUT YES THE WAY YOU CHARACTERIZE SKINNER THE HUNDRED MILLION AGREED TO IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND THEN WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING FOR THE SENATE SIDE IS AN- ADDITIONAL- FUNDING A HUNDRED SEVENTY SO THE TOTAL YOU REFERENCE TO TWO SEVENTY IS CORRECT. THE FUNDING WOULD ADDRESS ISSUES OF EXTREME HEAT BUT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE RESILIENCE BENEFIT ACROSS CLIMATE IMPACTS OTHER CLIMATE IMPACTS AS WELL AND I CAN LET MY COLLEAGUE PAUL BABBITT. BY A SMALL DETAIL OR LAND AS. WELL NO I THINK THAT PERFECTLY TURNED YOU SENT JUST TO. THAT WE INTEND TO BUILD. WHERE WAS SO AND- ARE DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND EXTREME HEAT AND SUPPORT COMMUNITIES IN EXTREME HEAT AND OTHER CLIMATE DISASTERS AND OTHER EMERGENCIES SO THERE REALLY. COMPREHENSIVE AND NOT SPECIFIC TO A SINGLE FRAME ISSUE FOR BOTH THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION AND THE ADDITIONAL. INITIAL ONE HUNDRED. CAN I HAVE MISS EHLERS FROM ARE. THE L. A. O. COMMENT ON THIS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST IN YOUR COMPREHENSIVE. EXTREME HEAT DID YOU CATCH THAT THERE WAS WE HAD AGREED ON A HUNDRED MILLION BUT THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION FOR TWO SEVENTY- BUT I DON'T KNOW IF CENTER STERN I DIDN'T GET IT AND SINCE WE'RE HERE IN THE COMMITTEE. HOW THE REST OF THE SENATORS AND THE LEGISLATORS WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IN THIS AREA DID YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. YEAH I MEAN YOU CAN SEE- AND SORT OF THOSE BULLETS WE GAVE YOU AS AS OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS ONE OF THEM IS THIS IS THIS IS NOT IN ISOLATION YOU KNOW THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND THEN WE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THOSE PIECES- YOU KNOW FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DATA AND THAT SORT OF THING. I THINK I THINK OUR OVERARCHING POINT YOU IS REALLY WHAT YOU ARE STARTING TO GET OUT WHICH IS THINK ABOUT THIS STRATEGICALLY AS A WHOLE WHAT ARE YOUR PRIORITIES YOU KNOW WHAT ARE KIND OF. YEAH I USUALLY WE THINK THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS ONE IMPORTANT ONE- PARTICULARLY AS SENATOR STERN AT NOTED GIVEN- THE VULNERABLE. POPULATIONS WHO LIVE IN RESIDENCES THAT ARE- ARE ARE KIND MOST AT RISK FROM SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES SO- I THINK THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR POINTS DO YOU IS THINK THINK ABOUT THESE PIECES ALL TOGETHER AND NOT NOT IN ISOLATION- BUT THEN ACROSS ALL OF THEM. YOU KNOW I THINK OUR GUIDANCE WOULD BE WHAT ARE YOUR BIGGEST PRIORITIES WHAT ARE THE CATEGORIES OR AREAS THAT YOU THINK. ARE MOST IMPORTANT ND I THINK THEY ARE PART OF WHAT THIS CONVERSATION IS HIGHLIGHTING AS WE ARE STILL I THINK OF THE STATE IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF DEVELOPING- A STRATEGIC PLANNING GRAPPLING WITH THIS THIS CLIMATE CHALLENGE THAT MINISTRATION IS HAS ONLY VERY RECENTLY PUT FORTH THAT THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN. YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL WORKING TOWARDS KIND OF WHAT OUR GOALS WHAT ARE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES AND HOW DO WE BUILD TOWARDS THOSE SO- DID DID THIS IS A FOR THE FIRST THIS IS NOT THE ONLY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO BE AT DECIDING HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS. BUT IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT BIG OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME BIG PROGRESS GIVEN THAT THE DOLLARS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CATEGORIES YOU WANT TO FOCUS AND DOES THIS OVER ARCHING. PACKAGE OF FUNDING NOT JUST. THIS THREE HUNDRED MILLION BUT ALL THAT YOU ARE TALKING A ABOUT. KIND A BALLOT ALL OF THE PRIORITY IN THE WAY YOU THINK YOU THINK ARE MOST IMPORTANT. CENTER CERTAIN THANK YOU. KNOW APPRECIATE THE- CLARIFICATION THERE. I MEAN I GUESS WHAT I WOULD WHAT I WOULD ASK IS WE AS WE REFINE OUR GOALS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION DIVING IN I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO WAIT TO. FIGURE EVERY LAST DETAIL THAT I THINK I THINK WEHAVE TO START JUST LEARNING BY DOING AND I THINK A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY WELL. TESTED AND APPRECIATE THAT I GET THAT THERE'S SOME NEWS NEW ELEMENTS IN HERE AS WELL. FROM AN OUTCOMES PERSPECTIVE THOUGH IN TERMS OF THE METRICS THAT IS DRIVING THE STRATEGY FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THOSE SORT OF WHAT IS THE CENTRAL METRIC FOR DEFINING SUCCESS FOR THIS EXTREME HEAT. STRATEGY WOULD YOU SAY. BINANCE YOU WANT TO TAKE THEM WITH YOU AND- YEAH I MEAN I'M I'M JUST SAYING I'D MAYBE EIGHT I CAN HELP. AT A POLICY LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE IS IT HOW MANY PEOPLE. WE'RE GOING TO BE PROTECTING FROM EXTREME HEAT. LIKE HOW HOW MANY HOW MANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WILL BE PROTECTED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- IS IT A SORT OF REGIONAL COVERAGE ISSUE IS THAT. YOU KNOW IT AND IT'S HONESTLY A PER. ACRE PER MILE- YOU KNOW RATIO OF INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE I. MEAN TO ME PEOPLE SHOULD ALWAYS DRIVE IT AND SO. I BUT I DIDN'T I JUST DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WE THINK. THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL INCLUDING ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS INCLUDING THE FIVE HUNDRED ANDVERY IMPORTANTLY NOTING THAT THE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION ADDITIONAL FOR EQUITABLE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION PLUS THE ADDITIONAL FIFTY. THERE'S A BILLION DOLLARS FOR BUILDING D. CARD THAT WE EXPECT TO SEE IT GO UP IN THIS IN THIS BUDGET- BUT- HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU ANTICIPATE THIS STRATEGY. HELPING. A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION I THINK. YEAH SOMETHING THAT WE GRAPPLE WITH WHEN IT COMES TO ADD QUANTIFYING THE OUTCOMES OF CLIMATE RESILIENT INVESTMENTS IS THAT IT'S VERY DEPENDENT ON THE TYPE OF PROGRAM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THE METRICS AND SORT OF GOT GOAL POSTS ALONG THE WAY FOR THE INVESTMENT IN THE EQUITABLE BUILDING D. KERR- PROPOSAL IS GOING TO THEY'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE METRICS. AND GUIDEPOSTS ALONG THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR- YOU KNOW WORKER PROTECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS AND SO WHAT I THINK THE BIG PICTURE MESSAGE TO YOU IT IS THAT AS WE ROLL OUT EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS THERE WILL BE TWO METRICS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE MEASURING OUR PROGRESS AGAINST. THAT DRIVE IN PARTICULAR ON THAT THE PRIORITIES FOR STATE ADAPTATION IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S SIX PRIORITIES THAT WE'VE LAID OUT BURKE AS NORTHSTAR'S WHEN WE'RE INVESTING IN A CLIMATE RESILIENT PROGRAM WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO AND YOU KNOW THESE OUTCOMES ARE YOU KNOW PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. YEAH MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE- AND YOU KNOW WE'VE INCLUDED VERY SPECIFIC SUCCESS METRICS IN BEING USED DON'T DID TO MEASURE OUR PROGRESS AGAINST THESE PRIORITIES AND SO WHEN WE BUILD OUT THE FINAL PACKAGE HERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ENSURING THAT EACH OF THE PROGRAMS BASED ON YOU KNOW THEIR SPECIFIC- AREAS OF FOCUS THE FACTOR THAT ARE WORKING IN. THAT ARE GOING TO BE DRIVING ON THOSE PRIORITIES AND ARE GOING TO HAVE CLEAR METRICS FOR SUCCESS IN YOU KNOW PROTECTING PEOPLE BUILDING COMMUNITY ANDECONOMIC. SENATOR STERN IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION TO HAVE AT THE BEGINNING A IS WHAT WHAT INFORMATION ARE WE LOOKING FOR IF THESE ARE PILOT PROJECTS SOME OF THEM AND WE'RE TRYING TO TEST OUT AND SEE WHAT WORKS ARE WE GONNA BE COLLECTING THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO COME BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE AND DO THAT SORT OF EVALUATION- SO AS MY CALLING THIS ROW MENTION IN THIS IN YOUR- AGENDA. THINKING ABOUT IS THEIR DIGITAL RESEARCH AND IS THERE SOME FUNDING THAT PERHAPS SHOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR DOING SO MUCH OF THAT WORK TO DO SOME OF THAT RIGOROUS TESTING OF WHAT DID WORK WHAT WHAT DO WE GET FROM FROM THE FUNDING WHAT WERE THE OUTCOMES- SO SOME OF IT COULD JUST BE REPORTING LANGUAGE AND PLAN INCLUDING THAT BUT BUT YOU ALSO COULD THINK ABOUT ARE THERE SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE FUNDING THAT NEEDS TO BE DEDICATED TO DOING SOME OF THAT EVALUATION SO. THAT AS AGAIN THIS PROBLEM IS NOT GOING AWAY- WHEN WE'RE REVISITING THIS IN A COUPLE OF YEARS- AND THINKING ABOUT WHERE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS DO WE KNOW WHAT WHAT THAT KIND OF MOST COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES ARE. AND I DON'T I WON'T BELIEVERS THE THIS WILL BE JUST BE MY PHONE POINT- DON'T WANTED THAT DON'T IMPLY AT ALL- IN INTERESTING PUMPING THE BRAKES IN FACT I'D RATHER ACCELERATE THIS FURTHER I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING. MORE FOR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS AND HUBS- I THINK THAT WE CAN BUILD ON AB EIGHT FORTY ONE AND IT'S AN ACCELERATOR GREEN SCHOOLYARDS AND SCHOOL RETROFITS PROGRAMS I THINK THAT. THE WORK FORCE AND ENFORCEMENT PIECE THE HEALTH DATA SYSTEM ALL THESE ARE CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT. I'D I THINK. EVEN THOUGH I RECOGNIZE TO BE SECRETARY THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO SORT OF FIND A SINGLE METRIC ACROSS THESE SORT OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. IF WE CAN IDENTIFY UP FRONT HOW MANY PEOPLE EITHER THEIR WORKPLACE OR THEIR HOME. ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS PARTICULAR CLIMATE IMPACT. AND HOW MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE DO WE EXPECT THESE INVESTMENTS TO MEET EITHER AT THEIR WORKPLACE AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTER. AT THEIR HOME WHEREVER THAT MAY BE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AT RISK AND HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE EXPECT TO MITIGATE THAT RISK FOR AND REALLY HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO HOW WELL WE'RE DOING TOWARDS THAT I THINK IT WILL GIVE. THE STATE. PEOPLE TO STAY A LITTLE SOMETHING MORE TANGIBLE TO WRAP THEIR HEADS AROUND- IF THERE ARE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS KNOW THIS OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD IT'S NOT IN THE BACKGROUND REPORT BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY VULNERABLE TO EXTREME HEAT IN CALIFORNIA HOW MANY TO EXPECT TO BE IN THE FUTURE AND- I MEAN THIS FOLKS TO EXPECT TO HELP HERE SO. IF WE CAN GET THAT RESOLVED TODAY OR GET SOME INSIGHT I'M REALLY HOPING WE CAN WORK ON THAT I'VE THROUGH LEGISLATION. OR CERTAINLY THROUGH YOUR YOUR ACTION PLAN PERHAPS THE CODIFICATION THERE UP SO. IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS I'D APPRECIATE IT BUT- REALLY REALLY LOOK FOR DIGGING IN HERE AND WORKING WITH YOU GUYS THROUGH ALL THIS AND ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES BECAUSE- WE CAN'T AFFORD TO. TO JUST STUDY IN PUZZLE FOREVER HERE- BUT YEAH ANY FINAL COMMENTS ARE WELCOME. YEAH THIS IS NOON TOMORROW JUST A QUICK- POINT TO YOUR AND YOUR LAST POINT IN TERMS OF. RESEARCH AND UNDERSTANDING I WOULD JUST POINT TO THE INVESTMENT THAT WAS MADE YOUR LAST YEAR'S CLIMATE BUDGET FOR CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENTS WHICH WERE AS YOU KNOW SENATOR STERN CODIFYING. UNDERSTANDABLE TWENTY AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW FROM- HE ARCED PERSPECTIVE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY LOOKING AT THE- FIFTH PLANET CHANGES THAT'S MEANT. AS ANOTHER FEET AND HELP US ANSWER THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT YOU RAISED TODAY SO. JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AND FEED INTO THIS CONVERSATION AS WE LOOK FORWARD. ONE FINAL. YOU'VE CAL FIVE TO DO THE GROUP THE GREEN SCHOOLYARDS. AND I WE UNDERSTAND THAT URBAN FORESTRY COMES UNDER CAL FIRE BUT WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO DEAL WITH THE FIFTY EIGHT. A COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ON ON THE GREENING OF THEIR SCHOOL PROPERTIES OR YOU KNOW I MEAN I LIKE NATURE BASED WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE MAYBE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF BUILDING A PATIO COVER IN SOME. AREA OF THE SCHOOL WHY GO TO CAL FIRE FOR THE ASSISTANCE ON THIS GREEN SCHOOLYARDS THE GREAT PART IS THAT A NATURAL FIT THAT I'M MISSING. YEAH WELL ACTUALLY I THINK THE ANSWER IS A LITTLE BIT YES- CALPERS BEEN DOING- SOME OUTREACH TO SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS- SO THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEGUN ARE ALSO WORKING WITH FOLKS- WITHIN STATE AGENCIES IN EDUCATION- I THINK THE BIGGER PICTURE RESPONSE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE. A PLACE WHERE SCHOOLS THE FUNDING THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE INVESTING IS TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF SCHOOLS WHICH ARE UNIQUE AND- I HAD SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THAT. REQUIRED SOME NUANCE AND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO YOU KNOW THE GRANTS THAT WE WOULD BE PROVIDING- I THINK ALSO JUST WANT TO FLAG THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S- THERE'S A- PARTICULAR INTEREST. IN THIS PROGRAM TO BE FOCUSING ON SCHOOLS THAT ARE AT THE MOST VULNERABLE TO KEEP AND MANY OF THOSE CALLS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE IN- YOU KNOW LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH. NOTHING BUT ASPHALT AND- SO THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR. THE WORK THAT CAL FIRE IS EXTREMELY SKILLED IN DOING WHICH IS REMOVING THAT ASPHALT REPLACING IT WITH THREE CANOPY BUT N ADDITION AND OTHER SORT OF GREENING ELEMENTS. THAT SUPPORT STUDENT LEARNING AND HEALTH THAT COOL SCHOOLS AND CAN REDUCE ENERGY COSTS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE CAL FIRE HAS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF TRAINED PERFECT. URBAN FORESTERS THEY ARE EQUIPPED TO SUPPORT THE AT. MAINTENANCE MANAGERS IN SCHOOL TO DO THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE THAT IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO I THINK HEALTHCARE IS ACTUALLY A REALLY GREAT PLACE TO START WE'RE REALLY EXCITED THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE PARTNERING VERY CLOSELY. WITH OTHERS ACROSS OUR AGENCY I HAVE DONE SOME COOL BRINGING PROJECTS BEFORE THEY HAVE BEEN SOME SORT OF. YOU KNOW ONE OFF HERE AND THERE FIND FINAL POINT IS JUST TO SAY WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH- DGS AND COLLEAGUES IN THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS- THE DIVISION OF THE STATE ARCHITECT. SO THAT THOSE COUNTY ENTITIES THAT YOU MENTIONED WILL BE ENGAGING WITH THEM AND ENSURING THAT AS WE BUILD OUT THE GUIDELINES AND IT YOU KNOW WORK ON THE PROGRAM AND RAISE AWARENESS OF THIS OF THIS PROGRAM- THAT WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING THROUGH THOSE CHANNELS AS WELL. I JUST I. WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS GETTING ALL THE CALGARY. APPROACH OF OUT ON FOR PREVENT AND FIRE WILDFIRE- WOULD CALIFORNIA BE BACK BEFORE US AND THEY'VE TOLD US THAT THEIR- WORKFORCES TIRED THAT THEY'RE UNABLE TO DO THE- OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT BECAUSE THEY'VE COULD FIRE SEASONS BECOME A SEASON LONG- SO. IT'S GREAT THAT THE HAVE INDICATED TO YOU THAT THEY WANT TO DO OUTREACH TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT THERE'S MANY A TREE HAS BEEN PLANTED BUT IF THE MAINTENANCE AND IT IT IT WILL BE THOSE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S IN THE SCHOOL MAINTENANCE SITES THAT WATER DAM. THAT MAINTAIN THEM SO IT IS GREAT TO PLAN TO SPEND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON PLANT TREES AND GET IT ALL BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT EIGHT YEARS SEVEN YEARS DOWN THE LINE WHO'S TAKING CARE OF THOSE. THERE'S MANY A MANY A- REYES BED SCHOOL GARDENING PROGRAM THAT HAS NOBODY TENDING TO IT NOW BECAUSE THERE THE TEACHER HAS LEFT AND THERE'S NO PERSONALIDAD THAT IS A SET UP ON THAT SO. THIS IS WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN I. APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S COMMENTS I THINK THERE'S A- HOPEFULLY. THEY'LL BE SOME IMPROVEMENT HOPEFULLY FINANCE THAT YOU SEE THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION CARVE OUT AN ANTI ALL THE RIBBONS TOGETHER SO THAT THE PUBLIC AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE NO WHAT ARE EIGHT HOW ARE EIGHT HUNDRED IS BEING. DEVELOPED AND IF THERE'S CONSIDER IF THERE'S- OVERLAP AND TELL US THAT THERE'S OVERLAP AND THIS IS WHAT ALL THE ACTUAL AMOUNT IS- BUT THIS IS. THE FIRST CANDIDATE SO APPRECIATED WE WILL. HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER OF FOURTEEN WHICH IS OUR NEW ACER NATURE BASED SOLUTION WE WELCOME OF- DEPUTY SECRETARY HANSON AGAIN WITH THEIR RESOURCE AGENCY WE GET CAL FIRE WE HAVE THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD WE HAVE THE CAL CONSERVATION CORPS DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION THE DELTA CONSERVANCY THE TAHOE CONSERVANCY AND THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAIN CONSERVANCY'S. CAL RECYCLE FINANCE CDFA. GOODNESS SAN JOAQUIN DELTA CONSERVANCY OF LET'S GET STARTED. GO AHEAD THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS AMANDA HANSEN AND AGAIN AND I SERVE AS THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY MY COLLEAGUE IS ALSO GOING TO INTRODUCE HERSELF. MORNING I'M JENNIFER NORRIS I AM THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR BIODIVERSITY AND HABITAT AT THREE FOR THE AGENCY. I LEADER THIRTY BY THIRTY EFFORT THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. SO WE JUST WANTED TO START BY THINKING THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN ADVANCING A RECORD SETTING CLIMATE BUDGET LAST YEAR INCLUDING FOR CLIMATE ACTION. IN THE SECTOR THAT WE ARE DIVING INTO TODAY WHICH IS THE NATURAL WORKING LAND SECTOR MAKES UP APPROXIMATELY 90% OF CALIFORNIA ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION ACRES. OF FARMS FORESTS WETLANDS DESERT COMMUNITY GREEN SPACES AND MARK. TREES PLANTS GRASSES AND SOILS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN REMOVING AND STORING CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. AND WHAT OUR LANDSCAPES ARE HEALTHY THEY PROVIDE A POWERFUL ST TO ABSORB GREENHOUSE GASES AND THEY CAN HELP US MOVE TOWARD OUR GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY. HEALTHY PLANTS CAN ALSO PROTECT PEOPLE AND NATURE FROM THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND BUILD OUR RESILIENCE TO FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS. VERY IMPORTANTLY THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE. WHEN OUR LANDS ARE UNHEALTHY THEY BECOME ANOTHER SOURCE OF CARBON POLLUTION RELEASING MORE GREENHOUSE GASES THAN THE STORE. AND UNDERMINING OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY. IN ADDITION UNHEALTHY LANDS INCREASED CLIMATE RISKS TO PEOPLE IN NATURE AND ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. LAST MONTH WE RELEASED THE FIRST EVER STATEWIDE STRATEGY TO GUIDE AND ACCELERATE CLIMATE ACTION ACROSS OUR NATIONAL WORKING LANDS AND IN ADDITION TO OUTLINING HOW MANAGING. CAN SUPPORT OUR CLIMATE GOALS THE STRATEGY ALSO IDENTIFIES HOW THESE ACTIONS CAN INCREASE EQUITY PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S BIODIVERSITY. AT THE SAME TIME WE RELEASED OUR PATHWAYS TO THIRTY BY THIRTY STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF CONSERVING 30% OF OUR LANDS AND COASTAL WATERS BY TWENTY THIRD. THIRTY THIRTY IS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT TO PROTECT MAJOR AND CALIFORNIA'S THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVE WILL CONSERVE OUR LANDS AND COASTAL WATERS TO SAFEGUARD OUR UNIQUE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. INCREASE ACCESS TO NATURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND DELIVER CLIMATE ACTION CAN BENEFIT. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET COMMITTED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OVER THREE YEARS FOR MULTI BENEFITS NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS INCLUDING A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SET ASIDE. OVER TWO YEARS TO KICKSTART IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL WORKING LANDS CLIMATE SMART STRATEGY AND PATHWAYS TO THIRTY BY THIRTY WE RELEASED A PROPOSED APPROACH FOR INVESTING THESE FUNDS ON APRIL TWENTY SECOND. I BELIEVE IT'S LOCATED ON PAGE TWENTY THREE OF THE AGENDA HERE TODAY. THE PROPOSED ALLOCATION BUILD ON EXISTING FUNDING TO ADDRESS CLIMATE AND BIODIVERSITY CRISIS. IT UNDERSCORES CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO ADVANCING EQUITY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND IT OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY IT OFFERS THE CHANCE TO REALLY ADVANCE BOTH OF THE INITIATIVES. NEVER WORKING MAN'S CRIMES ARE STRATEGY AND THIRTY BY THIRTY AND IT WAS DEVELOPED IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO FIVE KEY PRIORITIES THAT EMERGED MORE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT THE FIRST WAS THE STATE CAN REALLY SUPPORT ACCELERATING IMPLEMENTATION OF NATURE BASED SOLUTION. SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO BUILD ON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INVESTMENTS THREE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR PROGRAMS THAT FUNDS STATEWIDE NATURE BASED SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION. THE MAJORITY OF THESE BONDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO PROGRAMS THAT YOU NO LONGER HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE OR VERY LOW FUNDING FOR OUR NEW. THIS AREA OF INTEREST THAT WE HEARD FIRST STATE INVESTMENT IN ACTION IS SUPPORTING REGIONAL ACTION. SO WE'RE SO GRATEFUL TO WORK ALONGSIDE SO MANY CLIMATE AND CONSERVATION LEADERS. MANAGING LANDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES FARMERS AND RANCHERS LAND TRUST. CONSERVATION CORES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFIT COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS THE LIST GOES ON. AND ARE PROPOSAL INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS IN ACCELERATING NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. THE THIRD AREA OF FOCUS IS REALLY CREATING OPPORTUNITIES OR CREATING EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG CLIMATE LEADERS. ACROSS ALL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA WE HEARD AS WE CONDUCT OUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WE HEARD SIGNIFICAN ENTER INTEREST IN DELIVERING ON THE GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE AN OPPORTUNITY AGENDA. YOU'RE EXPANDING OUR RESTORATION ECONOMY JOBS IN MARKETS THAT CONSTRUCT OPERATE MAINTAIN OR OTHERWISE SUPPORT FEATURE BASED SOLUTION. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONCEPT CORPS BLACK OF LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE. ARE PROPOSING TO INVEST FIFTY TWO MILLION FOR THE STATE COR TO SUPPORT PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING LOCAL COURT IN NEW TRAVEL FOR. THE FOURTH AREA FOCUS FOR OUR PROPOSAL IS INCREASING OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES WERE PROPOSING TO INVEST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT TRIBAL INITIATIVES THAT ADVANCE SHARED CLIMATE AND BIODIVERSITY GOALS THROUGH NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. THESE INCLUDE RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE CAPACITY BUILDING TRIBAL NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS TRAVEL NATURE BASED CLIMATE CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. INCREASE ACCESS INCOME MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND ANCESTRAL LAND RETURN OR TRIBALLY LED AN INFORMED PROCESS. WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH BOTH PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND GOVERNMENT A GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION WITH OVER SEVENTY CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE PACKAGE OUR PROPOSING TO INVEST TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ADVANCE SEVERAL NEAR TERM PRIORITIES THAT REQUIRE PILOTING CONSULTATION ANALYSIS OR CONSULTING SERVICES. THE MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT LAUNCHING A PILOT COMPOSTING PROGRAM. IN ADDITION THESE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT THE A NATURE WHICH IS A SUITE OF INTERACTIVE MAPPING AND VISUALIZATION TOOLS ADVANCED THIRTY BY THIRTY. AND THESE PLANS WILL ALSO BE USED TO INFORM OUR APPROACH TO AREAS OF NEAR TERM FOCUS FOR STATE ACTION THAT REQUIRE CONSULTANTS CERVANTES X. BURKE RECOMMENDATIONS CONVENING. ANALYSIS AND STAKEHOLDER PARTNERSHIPS AND ENGAGEMENT. SO I'LL JUST WRAP BY SAYING WE KNOW THAT SUCCESS IN THIS SECTOR REALLY REQUIRES OUR COLLECTIVE ACTION AND WE APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP OF ALL THOSE I MENTIONED AND THOSE THAT ARE ARE ALSO CONTRIBUTING IN THE SPACE. WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE TO- NORTH DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY ON. BIODIVERSITY THAT YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT. NO I'M ONLY THAT THESE INVESTMENTS- WILL HELP US ACHIEVE THAT THE THREE OBJECTIVES OF THIRTY BY THIRTY YOU KNOW BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION BEING PART OF THE MAIN GOAL BUT ALSO INCREASING OUR ACCESS NATURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE SO WE CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE BUT THIS PACKAGE IS DESIGNED TO MEET ALL OF THOSE NEEDS- COLLECTIVELY- SECRETARY DEPUTY SECRETARY I CAN'T SPEAK FOR. MY TWO COLLEAGUES ARE ON THE DAIS HERE BUT I KNOW THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR THAT THEY PUT MONEY INTO WORKING LANDS AND NATURAL SOLUTION SO WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT THE REPORT THAT THE YOU CAME UP WITH A YEAR THIRTY FOUR THIRTY PLAN HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. WE ARE HAVE A ALWAYS SEEN EYE TO EYE WITH FINANCE WHO HAS TAKEN MONEY OUT OF THE BUDGET IN PREVIOUSLY YEARS SO WE'RE ALL GLAD THAT WE'RE ONE BIG PARTY TOGETHER WORKING SIDE BY SIDE. SO L. YOUR COMMENTS ARE THIS. UP IT MORNING SHERIN SENATORS TELLING CRISTINA THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE A FEW HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON THE PACKAGE AND YOU'LL NOTICE SOME COMMON THEMES BETWEEN OUR COMMENTS ON THIS PACKAGE IN THE COMMENT THAT YOU RECENTLY HEARD- ON THE EXTREME TV PACKAGE AND SOME OF THAT REALLY ROBUST CONVERSATION- ON THAT PACKAGE I TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS RELATIVELY SHORT I'M THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO FLAG IT'S REALLY THE PACKAGES FOCUSED ON THE ADMINISTRATION GOALS. I'M SO YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT AND THE ADMINISTRATION THAT IT'S REALLY- AIMED AT ACHIEVING THIRTY BY THIRTY OR TRYING TO AT LEAST GET US TOWARDS THIRTY BY THIRTY- IT'S ALSO REALLY FOCUSED ON THE NATIONAL WORKING LANDS I'M SMART STRATEGIES- AND RECENT GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER SO CERTAINLY- I THINK WE THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THAT WAS GOLDEN PRIORITIES ARE WITH IT COOL THE PRIORITIES- PLEASE AND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF COURSE THAT COULD- THAT COULD. THAT WOULD BE- LOGICAL TO BE REFLECTED IN AND WHATEVER THE FINAL PACKAGES I WOULD ALSO NOTE ON THAT THAT THAT MANY COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE LACK MEASURABLE GOALS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THE NUMBER OF ACRES UNITS GET COULD BE THINGS LIKE NUMBER OF ACRES TREATED- ARE CONCERNED AND THEN HE SAID THOSE ARE AVAILABLE BUT AND IN MANY CASES THEY ARE THERE THEY AREN'T AND- YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES THERE'S JUST LIKE NUMBER GRANT THAT MIGHT BE AWARDED- THAT'S USEFUL- INFORMATION BUT REALLY WHAT WE WHAT WE WANT TO PROBABLY. GET A BETTER HANDLE ON IT ONE AT THE END OF THIS RIGHT LIKE ARE WE GET HOW MUCH CLOSER IF IT'S GOING TO GET US TO THIRTY BY THIRTY IF THAT IS THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATURE ONE- WHAT WHAT SORT OF WAY AND WHAT REALLY WILL BE CONSTRUED SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY HAPPY REYES TO HELP ALLEGE THE STAND WHAT TO EXPECT THE FUNDING- WHETHER THIS IS REALLY MOST COST EFFECTIVE NEXT TO PROGRAMS TO KEEP THAT YOU KNOW IF YOUR TO GET SET. CONSERVING ACRES YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH PROGRAMS ARE ARE BETTER AT DOING THAT. AT HOW CLOSE IS. THIRTY BY THIRTY EXAMPLE AND THAT IS THE GOAL I AND THEN ALSO YOU KNOW AFTER THE FACT WELL THE NEED ACCOUNTABLE SO WE THINK ARE REALLY IN. I LIKE WITH THE OTHER P. WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE PRO THAT ARE IN EFFECT ARE REALLY MORE THEMSELVES ONE TIME FUNDING THAT OTHERS SO WE JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS WHY- FORGET SOMETHING LIKE ACQUISITION OF OR EASEMENT THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR OUT OF YOUR TO YOUR PACKAGE OTHER TYPES OF THINGS LIKE CRAZY FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S PROPOSED THE FUNDING IS FUNDED AS PART OF. THIS PACKAGE- THE THING IS IT'S LIKE A AT. NIGHT LIKE TIFFANY. BUT HE NOT A ONE AND DONE TYPE OF THING AND THEN YOU TO DO- YOUR- FAVORITE- FOR A LONG. TIME FROM. IT'S KIND OF AN ONGOING ACTIVITY SELF THINKING ABOUT. THAT THAT MAKE THEM SENSE IN OF AT TWO YEAR. AND WE WOULD ALSO- THAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE PACKAGE IS EQUITABLE FOR THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS AYE BUT THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION IT IS INEXPLICABLE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT LOGISTICS YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT- ABSTRACTING ITS OVERALL BURKE BUDGET AND CONSIDERING THE EVER. OVERALL BUDGET ARCHITECTURE. I'M ALSO JUST KNOW THAT SOME OTHER FUNDING SOURCES MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS. IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN FUNDED IN THE PAST. FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND- AND CERTAINLY THAT THE FUNDING SOURCE THAT COULD BE USED- EITHER TO FIND SOME OF THESE- AND POTENTIALLY REPLACE GENERAL FUND OR OR AUGMENT- IF THERE INCOMPLETE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING. IN AND WE ALSO KNOW. THAT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL OVERLAP IN WHAT'S FUNDED IN THIS PACKAGE AS WELL AS WHAT FIND IT ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET I KNOW THIS IS A BEEN. A YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I'M WITH WITH A- BIG POINT. I'M IN EXTREME HEAT CONVERSATION BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY RELEVANT HERE ON NATURE BASED RIGHT- A LOT OF THE THINGS THEY DON'T MISTER JEFF. THAT NEATLY IN ONE. ONE AND YOU KNOW BUCKETS- SO FOR EXAMPLE WELFARE. OF UT GRADING OF FOR THE WEATHER PREVENTION. PROGRAM THAT ALSO FUNDED IN THE- WELFARE PACKAGE RIGHT THE ONE. IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT TRICKY I THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE GET. YOU KNOW FOREVER TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND. OKAY LOOK THINKING HOLISTICALLY ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE'S SPENDING OTHER PACKAGES IN OTHER PLACES. AS WELL. AND JUST ALSO WANTED NOTE THAT A LACK OF HIM. TO CHINA ON SOME OF THE PIECES THIS PASS- ALSO HAD A COUPLE EXAMPLE AND WE- ABOUT THAT. MILLION FOR TRIED. AND ACTIVISTS CERTAINLY SEEM REASON. TO AND- SOME FUN. TO ADDRESS AND HOW IN JUST. THAT HAVE BEEN HERE SICK- I THINK ONE OF THE TWO. BILL UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY HOW THOSE FUNDS BE USED WE HAVE YOUR- THAT IS- PROPOSED BE. RESPECTFOR TO BE THIS TRAVEL I PROCESS- BUT THE SIMPLE. SPECIFIC FOR HOW THOSE FUNDS USED- YOU KNOW IT COULD MEMORIALIZE THOSE- SO THAT WOULD HELP. YOU KNOW HELP ENSURE THAT WHATEVER BOTH LEGISLATURE HAS. R. G. SIMILARLY FOR EXAMPLE WITH A FIRE WILD. LIFE CONSERVATION BOARD FINDING IT COULD GO TO SUPPORT SIX DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. ON THE BOARD WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF ALLOCATING THOSE FUNDS LEGISLATURE COULD JUST. THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THE FROM THE TRADE OFF. GIVE THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT- THAT MAYBE DOESN'T ENSURE THE LEGISLATURE HAS QUITE AS MUCH CONTROL. AND FINALLY WE NOTE THAT UNLIKE THE OTHER PACKAGE THIS PACKAGE LIKE THE COUNTY BILLION REPORTING MEASURES. WE THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW AFTER THE FACT. COMPARE AND SAY YOU KNOW. THE WHAT IF THAT'S GOT AS- AND YOU KNOW REALLY WHAT WERE THAT WHAT WHAT DID WE LEARN ESPECIALLY FOR THE PILOT YOUR KEY PIECES THAT ARE PILOT PROJECTS- SO THOSE ARE SOME. REALLY PRETTY PROBABLY PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AREAS TO HAVE THAT KIND OF REPORTING. BUT JUST GENERALLY WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE ROBUST REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY- GIVEN AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HEY- ARE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. NO I'M ON TOP OF THAT THE- I UNDERSTAND MAYBE THE ADMINISTRATION'S HEARD THAT THE SENATE DEMOCRATS IF ISSUED. THEIR EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROPOSAL SO WE GET TO SORT THROUGH THAT WHAT WHAT THEY. HAVE ON. I GUESS LET ME JUMP IN THE CUTS. CORPS WE TALKED WE HAVE. TWO FOR. THE LOCAL TRY. A NATURE SOLUTIONS- SO THERE'S GONNA BE FOR TRIBAL CORPS WHAT. WOULD THEY BE DEFERRED DOING DIFFERENT THAN THE REGULAR COURT IN THIS AREA OF NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS WHAT WOULD BE. THEN THE FOURTEEN COURSE WE HAVE. MISS THOMPSON. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- HELLO MY NAME IS JIMMY THAT YOU B. THOMPSON THIS IS SECRETARY FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS IN CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY- SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT USE FOR TRAVEL- CONSERVATION CORPS. AND THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA- CONSERVATION COARSENING AS PROPOSING. AND THESE TRIBAL CORES WILL WORK- DIRECTLY WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES TO DEVELOP THESE PROGRAMS. WE WOULD THIS WILL BE A TRIBALLY LED PROCESS- BUT WILL FOCUS IN ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OF FOR. SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD TRIBAL YOUTH- THOSE INDIVIDUALS THOSE USEFUL BEING IDENTIFIED BY TRIBAL COUNCILS AND TRIBAL LEADERS. AND THE WORK WILL- IT WILL BE A MIXTURE OF PURSUING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. IN TRAINING- WITH A FOCUS ON NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. AND SO THESE CARS WILL WORK PRETTY SIMILARLY TO CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS IS IN REGIONAL CORES- BUT WILL BE VERY TIGHTLY LET AND FOCUSED ON TRIBAL NATURE BASED SOLUTION PRIORITIES. I AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TRIBAL LEADERS- AND TRIBAL COUNCILS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CARS. BUT IF A- THIS THEY'RE DOING WHAT'S GOING TO THE FORCED THEY'RE DOING FOR THINNING. WHAT WE HAVE. BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE HISTORICAL DENSITY SHOULD BE AND THEY'RE GOING TO GO IN AND DO SOME CLEARING OF UNDERBRUSH AND ALL THAT WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE- YOU CITY WILL BE LED BY. TRIBAL PEOPLE. OR THEY WOULD. SO CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES WOULD BE- DEVELOPING THESE CORES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AND SO THERE WOULD BE A FOCUS ON TRIBAL NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS PRIORITIES- THERE'D BE A FOCUS ON TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE- AND ALSO- SUPPORTING THE STATEWIDE EFFORTS IN THE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS TO YOU KNOW JUST OUT A BURSTING IN THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND SO YOU'LL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TRAVEL USE. TO LEARN THE SKILLS THAT TO HAVE THAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- BUT ALSO LEARN FROM TRIBAL LEADERS AND- CULTURAL PRACTITIONERS AND- AND YOU GAIN THOSE SKILLS AS WELL THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR NATIVE PEOPLE AND NATIVE. COMMUNITIES OF OKAY I GET I GET THAT THE TRIBAL BE ENTERED THE END THE AND THAT THAT PART OF IT I GOT IT I DON'T. UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL WORK BEING DIFFERENT BUT- THAT'S PROPOSAL- LET'S SEE MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS ON THE NATURE BASED- OUR- PROPOSAL- CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- REPEAT A SIMILAR THEME TO THE LAST TIME WHICH IS- SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION- PUTTING FORWARD SOME. SOME PRACTICAL AND VERY WELL GROUNDED SOLUTIONS AND DIGGING IN DEEP ON OUR BIODIVERSITY CRISIS ON OUR THIRTY BY THIRTY GOALS- AND I WOULD JUST ECHO AGAIN- I THINK WE CAN GO EVEN BIGGER. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT REFLECTED IN WITH THE SENATE'S PROPOSED AND I'M HOPING THAT WE- CONTINUE TO BE AMBITIOUS ON THIS CRITICAL PIECE OF OUR OF OUR CLIMATE PACKAGE- I'M WONDERING IF TWO QUESTIONS- HOW FOR TOWARDS OUR GOAL- GOALS DO YOU THINK THIS WILL GET US. AND WHAT WHAT ARE THOSE THOSE GOALS AT THIS POINT. I'VE BEEN GOVERNOR AGAIN THANKS FOR THE QUESTION YOU KNOW THAT'S A REALLY HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER WE'VE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF BACK OF THE ENVELOPE ANALYSIS AND IT'S CHALLENGING AND I CAN TELL YOU ONE OF THE REASONS AS THIS- YOU KNOW. ACQUISITIONS AND EASEMENTS IS ONE PIECE OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE THIRTY BY THIRTY- SO A LOT OF THIS FUNDING WILL HELP US WITH THAT THROUGH THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD AS WELL AS THROUGH CONSERVANCY- BUT AS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE COST OF ACQUISITION THEY'RE EVEN IF. A HIGHLY VARIABLE ACROSS THE STATE AND SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS HOW MANY ACRES PER DOLLAR YOU CAN COUNT ON- AND AS YOU KNOW IN FOR VERSUS- EVEN THOSE HAVE WIDELY DIFFERENT COSTS SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH THOSE ACRES IN TERMS OF GETTING HOW WILL GET US CLOSER TO THIRTY BY THIRTY. I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE EXPECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO- CONTRIBUTE A FAIR AMOUNT OF THIS RICH OUR GOAL I DIDN'T AT. CURRENT TIME THERE'S ABOUT A MILLION AND A HALF ACRES BETTER IN FEDERAL PROCESS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR OVERALL GOAL. AGAIN THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS IN THIS IS JUST ONE- BUT I THINK IT'LL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DOWNPAYMENT. AND IF YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO ADD SOMETHING. YES I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. YOU KNOW WE KNOW. THAT BASED ON THE MODELING THAT CARBON IS DONE AND THEY'RE SORT OF VERY FIRST INITIAL- ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SOURCES AND THINGS OF OUR LANDS. WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. AT THAT. UNPRECEDENTED CLIMATE SMARTLY AND MANAGEMENT IS NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY AND YOUR LONG TERM GLOBAL CLIMATE STABILIZATION GOALS. SO AT WELL I CAN'T NECESSARILY ANSWER THE QUESTION. OF SORT OF SPECIFICALLY HOW FAR WILL THIS PACKAGE GET US. I CAN'T SAY THAT IT IS CRITICAL TO BEGIN INVESTING NOW AND TO CONTINUE TO. MEASURE THE IMPACTS WHETHER THOSE BE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF RESULTS IMPACTS BUT IN PARTICULAR. AT THE EMISSIONS AS THE CLUSTERED OR AS- WE MOVED THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS REALLY ARE DRIVING CREDIBLE. AB KIND OF BENEFITS. IT DID TO ME WHAT IS CLEARLY A AT. AS HUGE OF WORK AHEAD OF US IN THE SPACE. M. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DIDN'T I MEAN I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY THAT. THAT ACREAGE OUGHT TO BE THE SOLE METRIC OR OR THE GOAL AND TO BE SECRETARY HANSEN I MEAN YOU NOTED CARBON- I THINK YOU KNOW BIODIVERSITY IS NOT NECESSARILY ONLY DICTATED BY. TOTAL NUMBER OF ACRES YOU COULD CONSERVE. MILLIONS OF ACRES IN THE WRONG AREAS WHERE THERE ARE NO SENSITIVITIES AROUND YOU KNOW SPECIES DECLINE AND YOU ACTUALLY WOULDN'T IMPROVE YOUR BIODIVERSITY RESILIENCE ANY FURTHER SO. WHICH ACRES THEY ARE MATTERS AND IN SOME WAYS SMALL SMALL PROJECTS CAN YIELD HUGE REWARDS LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY WHICH IS TINY IN ITS FOOTPRINT. BUT CAN HAVE MASSIVE EFFECTS. IMPROVING THAT ESTUARY- FINDING BIRD HABITAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE METROPOLIS- AS WELL AS THE SORT EQUITY GOALS THAT I THINK SHOULD SHOULD BE DRIVING ALL OF OUR WORK HERE- YOU KNOW. WE HAVE UNDERLYING ACCESS GOALS- ACCESS TO WILD OPEN SPACES ON THESE THINGS MATTER TO I'M SIMPLY SUGGESTING THAT WE START TO ARTICULATE THOSE- IN THE THIRTY BY THIRTY PROCESS AND I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY PUT OUT YOUR- INITIAL PLANNING DOCUMENT- FOLLOWING UP AND- WE SUBMITTED COMMENTS ON THAT. ON BEHALF THE RESOURCE COMMITTEE OF A NUMBER OF LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS- BUT ON THIS THAT SORT OF ACREAGE POINT. CONCEDING THAT IT OUGHT NOT MAYBE BE OUR CENTRAL METRIC BUT AT LEAST SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE TRACKING AND STUDYING AS WE GO WAS THERE ANY- CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF TOTAL ACREAGE- UNDER MANAGEMENT OR- THE SORT OF SCOPE OF WHAT. EACH CONSERVANCY HAS ON ITS PLATE- WHEN THE BREAK DOWN OF THE REGIONAL THAT REGIONALLY SUPPORTIVE ACTIONS WAS LAID OUT I NOTICED THAT IT'S SORT OF. EVEN ACROSS. A NUMBER OF CONSERVANCIES AND I JUST WANTED TO GET A SENSE OF. OF YOUR LOGIC THERE I MEAN I JUST BY WAY OF COMPARISON- YOU KNOW SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY SAN GABRIEL LOWER L. A. RIVER AND SAN DIEGO ALL HAVE THE SAME PROPOSED. ALLOCATION WHICH IS ELEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS- PER YEAR OVER TWO YEARS TO GET TO TWENTY TWO POINT TWO AND THEN THAT ADDS UP- SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY. I'M OVERSEAS ABOUT SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND ACRES IN THEIR THEIR PLAN THAT THEY'VE TARGETED FOR CONSERVATION. SAN GABRIEL HAS BUT TWO THOUSAND SO ABOUT THIRTY SIX TIMES LESS THAN THAT AND IN SAN DIEGO HAS TWO HUNDRED TIMES LESS THAN THAT WITH. JUST THREE OR SEVENTY FIVE ACRES TARGETED FOR. IN THEIR CONSERVATION PLANNING SO- HOW DID THAT HOW DID YOU SORT OF WAY THE SCOPE OF WORK. THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING- THESE OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO BE DOING ON YOUR ON YOUR REGIONAL ACTION PROPOSAL. I THINK THAT QUESTION I WOULD SAY- YOU KNOW FUNDAMENTALLY WE RECOGNIZE THAT REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP IS IMPORTANT AND THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO DO MORE AND THAT THERE'S PENT UP. NEED AND LIST PROJECT SORT OF THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR PARTNERS AND SO OUR INITIAL CUT WAS TO RECOGNIZE THAT ALL OF OUR CONCERNS YOU HAVE WORK TO DO AND THAT WE SHOULD DISTRIBUTE FUNDS ACROSS THOSE. BUT WE'RE OPEN. TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT FURTHER. READ IT APPRECIATE THAT I'M I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD JUST. I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT AS WE CONTINUE LOOKING AT THIS PROPOSAL AND YOU ALWAYS THE SENATE PROPOSAL AND WE START TO FLESH OUT THE THIRTY BY THIRTY PLAN. WHICH WE'VE YET TO SORT OF DIG INTO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE RESOURCES COMMITTEES THINKING ABOUT. DOING SOME- SOME INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THAT WORD MISS NORRISYOU COULD MAYBE COME IN AND YOU KNOW WE CAN START TO- SHARE THE PLANNING% MORE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S INSPIRING STUFF I THINK IT WILL. GIVE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES MUCH HOPE I WOULD JUST I WOULD SAY THAT I'M- LOOKING TO WHAT THE- THE CURRENT SORT OF SHOVEL READY IF YOU WILL. ROGIC LIST LOOK LIKE ACROSS THESE SORT OF REGIONAL AGENCIES WOULD BE. MMHM PERHAPS AN EFFECTIVE. TOOL I KNOW THAT- IN OUR BACKYARD- IN JUST THE EAST AREAS SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS AND RIM OF THE VALLEY PLAN THAT- CONGRESSMAN CHIFFONS CENTER PRETTY OF PROPOSED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT- THERE'S AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN IMMEDIATE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THAT WILL OTHERWISE OF FALL PREY TO. TO DEVELOPMENT- IN THE NEXT YEAR TOO THAT'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ONE PORTION OF THAT ENTIRE RIVER THE VALLEY AREA ALONE AND THIS IS JUST ONE TENTH OF THAT SO- LOOK FORTY DIGGING IN DEEPER BUT I THINK. YOU'RE LOOKING AT. WHAT WE CAN DELIVER ON QUICKLY KNOWING THAT ACQUISITIONS ARE TOUGH. AND THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S AT THE% HIGHEST RISK NOT JUST FOR BIODIVERSITY- BUT ALSO FOR OVER DEVELOPMENT AND FOR THOSE LANDS BEING GONE FOREVER RIGHT THAT COULD BE A USEFUL TOOL- BUT I APPRECIATE THE WORK HERE AND- AND ESPECIALLY THE THIS FOCUS HAVE HUGE TRUST IN W. C. B. TO GET THIS WORK DONE AND THEY'VE DONE INCREDIBLE WORK OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. AND THEN COMBINING THAT FINALLY BREAKING THROUGH THE IMPASSE ON ON REGIONAL ACTION I JUST WANT EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR YOU ALL- YOU KNOW OPENING THAT. OPENING THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WILL I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT THROUGH OUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THEIR REGIONAL GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY CAME FORWARD WITH LISTS OF PROJECTS THERE ARE PLACES ALL OVER THE STATE THAT- PEOPLE ARE REALLY ECITED TO PROTECT- AND WORK TOGETHER WITH THE FUNDS SO. I TAKE YOUR POINT POINTED OUT TO US THIS CHALLENGE OF QUALITY OVER QUANTITY. AND IT'S THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC PROPOSAL AUGMENTS THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US INTO ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN BY ONE. BILLION DOLLARS ON BIODIVERSITY PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE THIRTY BY THIRTY ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY TO DO THIS WORK SO- SINCE WE HAVE YOU IN FRONT OF US ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN AUGMENTATION- AND IT'S STILL SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION PARTICULARLY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY YOU THERE'S GOODNESS IN THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE US. IS THIS THE RIGHT BALANCE THE THIS IS THE BALLOT IF WE COME IN WITH ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS WE BELIEVE THAT MORE MONEY SHOULD GO INTO THE THIRTY BY THIRTY. OF THAT MONEY AT LEAST HALF OF IT. EVERYWHERE BUT WE HAVE A BREAK DOWN I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH IT BUT BUT ARE WE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH WITH GIVING MONEY TO ACQUIRE EASEMENTS OR PROPERTY IN ORDER TO MEET THESE ADMIRABLE GOALS OF THIRTY BY THIRTY- AND I ASK THAT QUESTION SOMEWHAT NOT KNOWING WHAT THE QUALITY THE QUANTITY RATIO IS GOING TO BE SO IF YOU COULD JUST. I KNOW. WE'RE HESITANT TO GIVE A FLAVOUR HERE BECAUSE IT BUT I'M ASKING DIRECT QUESTIONS SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WHEN ASKED A DIRECT QUESTION THE MINISTERS WILL RESPOND SO IS. IT THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION HOW WITH THAT BEST BE SPENT IN THIS QUALITY QUANTITY. RACIAL GIVEN THAT WE HAVE MONEY IN THE SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT ALREADY FORCING YOU'VE ALLOCATED AS YOU SEEN FIT KNOW THE QUANTITY VERSUS QUALITY QUESTION I THINK IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND THAT IS ACTUALLY WHY WE CREATED THIS. AMONG THE REFERENCE THAT CA NATURE WHICH IS OUR ONLINE INTERACTIVE MAPPING AND VISUALIZATION TOOLS THIS IS ACTUALLY- INTERACTIVE MAP THAT ANYBODY IN THE STATE CAN- ACCESS. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO BE USER FRIENDLY OR IF YOU'RE A REALLY TECHNICALLY CAPABLE- THAT PERSON TO USE OTHERS MULTIPLE SORT OF. LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY BUT ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AND SEE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE CONJURATION ALREADY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND COMPARE THAT TO. BIODIVERSITY HOT SPOTS PLACES WHERE YOU CAN- ADD CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXISTING PROTECTED AREAS LOOK AT HOW THOSE PLACES WILL- BE IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE MOVING FORWARD SO- CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION. THERE'S ANOTHER YOU CAN USE A LAYER TO LOOK AT WHERE WE HAVE A LITTLE ACCESS TO NATURE. SO WHERE ARE OTHER PLACES THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NATURE SO YOU CAN USE THAT TOOL. TO OUR SUITE OF TOOLS REALLY TO IDENTIFY THE HIGHEST QUALITY INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN MAKE. TO AND SO IT DIFFICULT BENEFIT WIDE LEVEL BUT EACH SORT REGION HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE MOST FOR THEIR BUCK HALF I JUST NOTE THAT THE- THIS. PROPOSAL HAS SIX HUNDRED AND- MILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY GOING TO THE CONSERVANCY'S OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO WHAT WE SEE THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR. FOR THEM THE ALL THESE THINGS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WE ANTICIPATE HAVING A CONTINUE REPLACING SHIPPED DIRECTLY WITH THE CONSERVANCY'S FOR THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE I KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF BILLS TO EXPAND BALDWIN PARKS IN SANTA MONICA. SAID ON THE SAME THEME THAT YOU GUYS ONE LAST QUESTION YOU'VE GOT UNDER- YOU GOT TN MILLION DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA THE GRAZING- THE FUEL REDUCTION. MY UNDERSTANDING THIS- YES GOES IN REMOVES THE TOXIC MATERIALS AFTER FIRE AND THEN CAL RECYCLE COMES IN AND DOES THE- THE- REMOVAL OF THE OTHER TIMBER- DEBRIS- WOULDN'T IT MAKE SENSE THAT THEY WOULD BE DOING. ONE OF THOSE TWO AGENCIES WILL BE DOING THE WORK. TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM CAL FIRE WHO'S ON THE TO HELP US IN THIS QUESTION. BECAUSE IT'S ALSO COMMUNITIES SO THAT WOULD BE. YEAH GET MORNING CARE MEMBERS OF- THIS IS THE FOX ASSISTANT- DIED DIRECTOR FOR CAL FIRE IN ACTING POSITION- THIS IS CENTERED AROUND THREE FIVE MITIGATION FOR HAZARDOUS REDUCTION I'M NOT FIRE. RECOVERY THAT YOU'VE JUST TO GO WITH CALLOW YES OUR EXPECT. OKAY SENATE STURM THE LAST. HOPEFUL THE SAID THE LAST WORD OF THE IS THE BIG OF A AND CONVERSATION AND APPRECIATE THE CHAIR SET A BAR HI BECAUSE WE NEED TO GET THEIR- JUST THE ONLY WAS ON. HELLO THE FUNDING THAT THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT- FOR- FOR TOMORROW FISH AND WILDLIFE ON A NATURAL COMMITTEE CONSERVATION PLAN TO ENHANCE NCC. IN THE HABITAT CON REACTING TO SOME THAT. THE MISS NOTED. THE PLAN F. THAT TO PRISSY AND SORT OF UP HI QUALITY THAT ALSO HIT SAY SOME QUAN GOALS. MIKE MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS THAT A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVEN'T DONE THAT WORK OR SAY THE CONSERVANCY'S HAVE THAT CONSERVE PLANNING IS THERE A IS THERE AN EFFORT UNDER WAY- TO AYE DRINKER. OR REQUIRE- EITHER LOCAL GUY OR AGENCIES- TO SAY PUT A CONSERVATION UP THEIR CON PLAY UPDATE THEIR OPEN SPACE PLAN I KNOW IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THE CITY IS NOT UPDATED ITS OPEN SPACE PLAN SINCE NINE SEVENTY THREE. WE DONE OUR HOUSING L. BUT- AND THAT'S IN YOU KNOW PENDING WITH HCD BY. HOW IS THERE A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE OR REAL JURISDICTION THAT ARE SORT OF. THEY'VE GOT THOSE THOSE ADOPTED PLANS IN PLACE IF YOU WILL AND MAYBE DFW IS NOT. EXACTLY THE PLACE TO BE DOING THAT I KNOW I YOU KNOW- AND BIASED HERE I'VE GOT LEGISLATION PENDING AS WELL THAT THEY WOULD REQUIRE AS MUCH- BUT AT THAT WOULD YOU KNOW MANDATE THAT THAT OCCURS BUT THERE AY BE A CARROT. CARROT APPROACH HERE TO ADD THOUGHTS ON THAT. YES THANK YOU WE YOU KNOW WE'RE DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED THAT AS AN IMPORTANT- TASK IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY ONE OF THE PATHWAYS AS PART OF REGIONAL- STRATEGIC CONSERVATION. YES THERE ARE YOU KNOW ANTICIPATED EIGHT CPUS THAT ARE DONE THAT WE CAN INVEST IN AND SOME OF THE FUNDING WOULD GO TO THAT. SOME OF IT ALSO WOULD BE TO HELP- OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVEN'T YET STARTED- IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THAT THERE'S ALSO MONEY I'LL POINT OUT FOR THE REGIONAL CONSERVATION INVESTMENT STRATEGY- PROGRAM- WHICH IS ANOTHER. A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE SAME. WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE- REGIONAL CONSERVATION PLANNING STRATEGIC PLANNING BUT THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT AVENUES THE ONES WE'VE IDENTIFIED HERE ARE. TRIED AND TRUE BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER LOCAL EFFORTS WERE FOLKS COME TOGETHER AND- AND DO THAT WORK SO IT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARD I KNOW DSW'S IDENTIFIED SOME PLACES- ACROSS THE STATE WHERE THERE IS NEED AND WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TO. INCENTIVIZE THEM BUT IT BUT A WILLINGNESS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO- TO SORT OF RIORITIZE AREAS WITH. PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED WITH WITH CONSUMMATE. YES HI. I THINK WE WANT TO DEFINITELY RELY ON THAT STRATEGIC THINKING RIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS THAT IDENTIFIES PLACES BUT- THE COMMUNITIES IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WANT TO SEE DEVELOPMENT AND WHERE THEY ARE INTERESTED IN DOING COMPENSATION THEY- USUALLY DONE THE VERY HARD WORK OF. IDENTIFYING THE KEY BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION AREAS THAT THEY NEED TO YOU KNOW FOCUS ON. SO YES THOSE KINDS OF STRATEGIC PLANS WILL HELP US MAKE SURE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS. ARE WIDE THANKS. MISS CHRISTIAN WHO ANYTHING THEY- NO YOU I'M HAPPY THINK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BUT NOTHING ELSE ADDED WELL I AM I LOOK FORWARD TO READING READING THE MAY REVISE IN THIS. PROJECT HERE AT HOPE EACH OF YOU GET A COPY OF- THE SENATE BUDGET PROPOSAL ON CLIMATE ADAPTATION LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD IN A COOPERATIVE AND- IN LIKE MANNER- OF WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION DISCUSSION WILL MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN. PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM YEAR'S BUDGET- BILL LANGUAGE AND SOME BCPS. GOOD MORNING. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY MY NAME IS JULIE HENDERSON I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. AND I LIKE TO JUST START WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT BY REGULATING PESTICIDES SALES AND USE AND BY FOSTERING REDUCE RISK PEST MANAGEMENT. WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE'S PESTICIDE REGULATORY PROGRAM EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE STATE'S PESTICIDE USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. ENFORCEMENT IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN DPR THE STATE LEVEL AND COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS AYE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. RIGHT OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL. ENFORCEMENT IF COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR STUFF. OUR VISION IS TO ACCELERATE THE SYSTEM MY TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. STEWARDING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT FUTURE FOOD PRODUCTION AND SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE URBAN PEST MANAGEMENT COLLABORATING WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO SUPPORT THIS TRANSITION TO BETTER PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT PARTICULARLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IF YOU ARE HIS PROPOSED THREE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AND TODAY I'M PRESENTING IT OUR PROPOSAL TO STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. THE PROPOSAL WILL ENSURE THAT THE STATE HAS MULTIPLE TOOLS TO ENFORCE STATEWIDE COMPLIANCE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT. THE REQUEST IS FOR EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND FROM THE DVR FUND FOR THREE PERMANENT POSITIONS TO INVESTIGATE AND DEVELOP PESTICIDE RESIDUE AND USE ENFORCEMENT CASES. AND FOR FUNDS TO HIRE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO REPRESENT DPR IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PESTICIDE USE OF FORCE IN ACTIONS. WELL THE VAST MAJORITY OF PESTICIDE USE IN CALIFORNIA COMPLIES WITH STATE LAW AND REGULATION STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT TOOLS WILL BETTER DETERMINE ACTORS AND IN DOING SO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THOSE WHO USE PESTICIDES RESPONSIBLY. THE PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH OUR GOAL TO EXCEL. THE TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT MY STRENGTHENING ENFORCEMENT TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THE STATE. AS WELL AS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO BETTER ENSURE PESTICIDE USE THE SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD REINSTATE DVRS ADMINISTRATIVE PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTY AUTHORITY AS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL AT THE STATE LEVEL. IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE STATUTORY ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTY CAPS THAT HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR DECADES. AND BETTER ALIGN WITH USEPA PENALTY LEVELS AND OTHER COUNTY PA TTL LEVELS. IT WOULD ALSO STRENGTHENED APPEARS PESTICIDE RESIDUE ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. AND I JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE WORKED THAT WORK WITH THE COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS ON CHANGES REGARDING ON THE DEPARTMENT'S ADMINISTRATOR OR SPENT AND PENALTY AUTHORITY- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE IMPRESSIONS YEAH THAT WAS THE QUESTION IS. ARE WE STEPPING ON ANY COUNTY COMMISSIONERS TOES HERE I MEAN THERE ARE FIFTY FOUR HOME OKAY. I THOUGHT FIFTY EIGHT IS FIFTY. NINE FIFTY SIX OTHER. OPENINGS. YES VERY GOOD QUESTION WHERE LEAVE PLACE THE CURRENT. WHAT THIS- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD ADD IS I'M OUR ABILITY IN THE CASE OF. MULTI JURISDICTIONAL VIOLATIONS TO BE ABLE TO FROM A STATE OVERSIGHT LEVEL I'M TAKING FORCING ACTIONS AND THE SOUTH- ADMINISTRATIVE. PENALTIES IN THOSE CASES ANY OTHER INSTANCE WOULD BE IF THERE IS A COMMISSION ARE- THAT DOES NOT CARRY OUT HIS OR HER DUTIES WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A BACKSTOP IN THAT CASE. MYSTERY MENACE WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS IT SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE PROPOSAL TO YOU. YEAH GOOD MORNING MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FRANK MENACE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE SEVERAL CHANGES THE PESTICIDE ENFORCEMENT OF PESTICIDE PENALTIES. SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO PESTICIDE USE RESIDUE- AND SALES THAT LICENSING ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL EXPANDS ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY FOR DPR IN TWO MAJOR WAYS. FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE PPR WITH THE AUTHORITY TO LEVY MINISTRY TO PENALTIES FOR PESTICIDE USE VIOLATIONS I'M CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. I RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY BEING REQUESTED ADDITIONAL COURSE MCCARTY WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO SERVICE THE BACKSTOPS. TO LOCAL ENFORCEMENT WHEN MERITED SUCH IS- SERIOUS SMALL JURISDICTIONAL VIOLATIONS WHILE STILL MAINTAINING- COUNTY ACT. COMMISSIONER AS THE PRIMARY LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. BUT ALSO REESTABLISH THE MERITORIOUS DEPARTMENT- PREVIOUSLY HELD- SECOND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE DPR WITH- ADDITIONAL RESIDUE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY- THIS IS- AREAS SUCH AS ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT TO LEVY ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES I'M TWENTY DAYS THAT DISTRIBUTE OR MOVE PRODUCE I'M TO HAVE BEEN QUARANTINED IT OF POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH PESTICIDE RESIDUE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE ADDITIONAL FORTY BEING REQUESTED WE FIND THAT THESE CHANGES COULD BETTER ENABLE THE STATE TO PREVENT CONTAMINATED PRODUCE FROM REACHING CONSUMERS- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO INCREASE IN ESTABLISH NEW PENALTIES ACROSS VARIOUS TYPES OF PESTICIDE VIOLATIONS. I'M THESE CHANGES CAN BE FOUND- IN A TABLE IN YOUR AGENDA- THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE DIRECTOR TO ADJUST CERTAIN PENALTIES FOR INFLATION IN FUTURE YEARS. OVERALL WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE-INCREASED PESTICIDE RELATED PENALTIES AND ALLOW FOR INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS IN MANY CASES- COUNTY LEVELS HAVE NOT BEEN INCREASE IN SEVERAL DECADES HAVE. LOSS THERE- RELATIVE ABILITY TO DETER VIOLATIONS OVER TIME. HOWEVER INCREASES COULD INCLUDE APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED PENALTY LEVELS WHILE MUCH APPEAR REASONABLE OR SETTING PENALTY LEVEL SOMEWHAT HIGHER LOWER BASED ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DEEMS APPROPRIATE TO ACHIEVE ITS GOAL AND DETERRING VIOLATIONS. I'M FINALLY THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES FUNDING TO SUPPORT DPR PESTICIDE USE AND RESIDUE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE FUNDING OF BEING WORK- DO THIS BY WITH ANY THE PART TO CONDUCT THE LOTUS. WITH THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF PENALTY ADORE ADORE DAVE AND ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO. REFER BY. TO THE ATTORNEY OFFICE- HAPPY TO A QUESTIONS YEAH ON POINT IF THE STAFF OF INDICATES THAT IT'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND IT WE'RE GONNA GET ONE OF THESE CASES EVERY TWO YEARS SO IT'S BASICALLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A CASE. TWENTY TO YOU CAN JUST GO OUT TO THE- TO. THE ZILLIONS OF ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA AND HAVE THEM DO THIS ENFORCEMENT. ACTION BECAUSE THAT THEY BE ENFORCING THE LAW WARD OR WHO'S GOOD WHO DOES THE ENFORCEMENT NOW INTERNALLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. WHEN THEY HAVE A CASE. MINISTER COST SAVINGS HERE BY USING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- YES ENTER IT I BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDING THAT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO FOR THE DEPARTMENT THAT WOULD BE LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THREE YEARS IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT- D. HISTORICALLY THE PR HASN'T HAD MANY REFERRALS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND THIS WOULD BE. A RELATIVELY NEW ACTIVITY AND WOOD ALL ATTEMPTS TO BE SEEN AS A PILOT AT THE END OF THE THREE YEARS WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SEE- THERE ARE FILES THAT- DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO REFER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND- THE SUCCESS OF- THIS FUNDING AND- WHAT HAS BEEN- WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES OF IT- BUT- I WOULD PREFER TO THE PART AND- THEY HAVE BEEN RIGHT. ADD ON TO THAT I MEAN IS IT A IS IT A RETAINER THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL BOXES COULD BE ON THAT IT'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THREE YEARS OF COVERAGE. AND THIS IS JULIE I'M HAPPY TO JUMP IN HERE- NO THIS WOULD NOT BE A ROUTINE OF THIS WOULD BE FOR ACTUAL FEES- AT. THAT ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND- JUST TO- PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT WE WORK REGULARLY. WITH THEM ON ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MATTERS RELATED TO THE APARTMENT AND THEY HAVE. A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE RELATED TO OUR WORK AND SO- THIS WOULD BE- IN CASES WHERE. IT'S THIS IS WHERE IT WOULD BE BUT- TO HAVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE ARE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL CASES THAT WOULD BENEFIT- FROM HAVING ATTORNEY GENERAL REPRESENT US IN MORE SERIOUS CASES- BUT- REGULAR CASES THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY HANDLE WE WOULD CONTINUE TO HANDLE AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL. AND NOW IF YOU DID HAVE A SERIOUS CASE. CURRENTLY YOU HAVE TO INTERNALLY USE MONEY THAT YOU HAVE AND REALLOCATE OTHER BOB BOB. POTS OF MONEY TO COVER THE ATTORNEY FEES TO PURSUE THIS- BAD ACTOR. EXACTLY RIGHT SO THIS WITH THIS HELLO. IF I'M OUT THERE IN THE WORLD OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES- THAT I WOULD SAY IF I WAS GOING TO IT NOT IF I WAS GOOD OVER SPRAY OR NOT CLEAN THE- RESIDUE FROM MY- FRUITS BEFORE A PRODUCT TO MARKET AND CREATED HAZARDOUS SITUATION AT LEAST FOR THREE YEARS THERE'S NINE HUNDRED. MIL NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ATTORNEY FEES TO COME AFTER ME SO YOU IT'S SORT OF WOULD SERVE OR POLICING ACTION FOR ANYBODY WHO'S OUT THERE THAT WOULD THINK THAT THEY THEY THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE NOBODY'S GONNA BE WATCHING THAT THE EXTRA STAFF AND THE FACT THAT THE HIRED GUN. AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS READY TO PURSUE YOU MAYBE. MAYBE NOT I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I THINK WE'VE. AS BEING A KEY EFFECTIVE DETERRENCE I'M IN IN THINKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO REFER CASES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IT'S AN ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THOSE CASES THAT. REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MORE CHALLENGING FOR US TO HANDLE AT. THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL. OKAY VERY GOOD STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD OPEN ANYTHING ELSE FINANCE TO ADD TO A DOCTOR ANDERSON BUT IT WELL THANK. THANK YOU DIRECTOR HENDERSON THANK YOU- ALLEY- LET'S MOVED HER LAST ITEM ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN WHICH WAS REMOVED. LAST WEEK BREAKING NEWS YOU. GOOD MORNING I GUESS I'LL START OFF THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN WITH THE PARTNER TAXES SUBSTANCE CONTROLS WITH THE SANTA SUSANA FIELD LAB CLEAN UP TEAM AND I WILL START OFF WITH THE CONGRATULATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT AND ALL THE PARTIES FOR THE AGREEMENT WITH THE BOEING- AIRCRAFT AND THE OTHER PARTIES OF INTEREST FOR THE- M. O. U. AFTER FIFTEEN LONG MONTHS OF NEGOTIATING AND- HERE'S OF RED- CONTAMINATION SO. CONGRATULATIONS BUT VIEW YOU STILL HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR FOURTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS SO TELL US ABOUT IT. WHAT WE DO WE DO INDEED AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR NEGRI WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH- I'M FRANCESCA NAZARIAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL AND WE'RE GONNA HERE TO- TALK PRESENT YOU TODAY ON OUR PROPOSAL FOR- CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES ACTIVITIES THE SENTENCES THAN A FIELD LABORATORY OR F. AS A FELON VENTURA COUNTY. SO AS YOU INDICATED YOU HEARD THE ANNOUNCEMENT EARLIER THIS WEEK REGARDING AN AGREEMENT THAT D. T. S. C. M. BOEING REACHED- RELATED TO CLEAN UP OF THE SITE- WE REACHED A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK WITH HE% BOEING COMPANY RELATED TO CLEAN UP OF THEIR AREA. AT SFL. D. ASIAN AGREEMENT FINALLY RESOLVE DISPUTES OVER BOEING'S OBLIGATIONS TO SOIL AND GROUNDWATER CLEANUP. DEVELOPS A PROCESS FOR- ACHIEVING A COMPREHENSIVE CLEAN UP AND LIMB LET LIMITS DELAYS FROM FURTHER LITIGATION. AND WILL RESPOND TO SOME QUESTIONS LATER ON IN DR WILLIAMS HAS SOME COMMENTS RELATED TO- THAT MEDIATION. HOWEVER THE BUDGET REQUEST IN FRONT OF YOU IS BROADER AND INVOLVES DTS HE'S OVERSIGHT OF CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES AT THE ENTIRE SITE BY MULTIPLE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES INCLUDING NASA AND THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ALONG WITH BOEING. SPECIFICALLY THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING A TOTAL OF THREE POINT ONE MILLION AND FOURTEEN POSITIONS ON GOING FOR THESE OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES THIS INCLUDES TWO POINT ONE MILLION FROM THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT AND ONE MILLION FROM THE FEDERAL TRUST FUND. THE POSITIONS REQUESTED INCLUDE EIGHT POSITIONS THAT ARE SITE MITIGATION AND RESTORATION PROGRAM AND SIX POSITIONS IN OUR OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL. YES IS THE BELL SITE JUST FOR SOME BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT THAT FUND TWENTY NINE HUNDRED ACRES IN THE HILLS OF VENTURA COUNTY AND WAS IN USE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AS A ROCKET ENGINE TESTING. AND NUCLEAR POWER RESEARCH FACILITY OPERATED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NASA AND BOEING. SITE CLEANUP ACTIVITIES OVERSEEN BY DGSE HAVE BEEN ONGOING SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND INCLUDE REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF OVER FIFTY ONE THOUSAND CUBIC YARDS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL AND OTHER MATERIALS. AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTATION OF A GROUND WATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT SYSTEM ACTIVITIES HAVE ADDRESSED- SIGNIFICANT CONTAMINATION AT SOME EARLY CLEAN UP AREAS A COMPREHENSIVE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER CLEANUP APPROACH ON THE ENTIRE AS ISABEL FIGHT IS STILL NEED IT. THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT THIS CLEANUP WHICH WILL BEGIN FOLLOWING CERTIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR P. E. I. R. WHICH IS NEAR COMPLETION. THE THREE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NASA AND BOEING ARE NOW UNDER BINDING AGREEMENTS THAT COMPEL A SCIENCE BASED STRINGENT CLEANUP OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL AND WATER AT. THEN AND WILL REIMBURSE THE DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THESE COSTS AS WELL AS FUND THE CLEANUP ACTIVITIES. THESE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES HAVE BEEN REIMBURSED TO THE APARTMENT- THE DEPARTMENT COUGH FOR YEARS AND THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS HISTORICAL PRACTICE. AND THE DEAL WE ANNOUNCED THE FUNDING HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO THE P. C. P. BUT FIRST DR MEREDITH WILLIAMS DGSE DIRECTOR WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS REGARDING THIS THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT YOUR FRIENDS THIS WEEK. DR WILLIAM. THANK YOU FOR JESSICA AND GOOD MORNING CHERYL CASKEY AND MEMBERS. AS YOU WELL KNOW MONDAY WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT WITH BOEING THAT HOLDS AND ACCOUNTABLE TO TIMELINES PROCESSES AND STANDARDS FOR A STRICT CLEANUP AT THE SITE. I'M HERE TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THAT ANNOUNCEMENTS. ON THE ELBOW THIS HEARING AND CLEARLY IS NOT A TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE IN PARTICULAR IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU HEAR YOUR ANY FAX DIRECTLY FOR ME- FIRST I HAVE TO REITERATE THE OVERVIEW THAT- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR NEGRI PROVIDED. AFTER YEARS OF LITIGATION AND INACTION THIS AGREEMENT ALLOWS FOR CLEAN UP TO A HIGHLY PROTECTED AND NEARLY UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL. I A RESIDENT IT FOR A RESIDENT WITH GARDEN CLEANUP STANDARDS. WHICH WOULD ENSURE THAT IT WOULD BE SAFE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THAT LAND. AND CONSUME PRODUCE GROWN IN THEIR BACKYARD GARDENS. THIS IS A STANDARD THAT'S LONG BEEN ADVOCATED FOR BY MEMBERS OF THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. IT RELIES ON AND WILL BE GUIDED BY THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE BAD SCIENCE IS DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH USEPA GOT. HONEST INTERFERENCE TO THE SCIENCE REQUIRES THAT WE FOLLOW IT EVEN WHEN ELEMENTS OF THE STANDARDS CHANGE. ANY ASSERTION THE DDS DGSE HAS WATERED DOWN THE CLEAN UP STANDARDS IS FALSE. THE AGREEMENT SUPPORTS A CLEAN UP THAT IS BOTH SCIENTIFICALLY RIGOROUS AND PROTECTIVE OF HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME THIS MORNING CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR NEBRIINAE BOMBS BEFORE TO YOUR QUESTIONS. SO HOW ARE YOU. THIS IS OF HISTORICAL M. O. U. HIGH STANDARDS- STRICT SCHEDULE SCRIPT DISTRICT TIMELINE. SHOULDN'T WE BE SHOULDN'T THEY BE ASKING FOR TEMPORARY POSITIONS RATHER THAN PERMANENT POSITIONS TO DO THIS WORK OF TO WORK COULD BE DONE. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON IT- GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN OF BREAKING MINUTES AGAIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PROPOSAL'S BEING FUNDED ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS SO IT WOULDN'T BE FUNDED FROM ANY OF. THE FEES AND TAXES THAT SUPPORTS DTS USE NORMAL ACTIVITIES SO FUNDING WOULD COME DIRECTLY FROM I'M RESPONSIBLE PARTIES- I GUESS. THE FUNDING IS LIMITED TERM IN NATURE BUT- ONCE CLEAN UP IS COMPLETED REIMBURSEMENTS ARE ARE. FULLY REALIZED I THINK THAT'S ONE FUNDING WOULD WOULD- TRIGGER OFF- BUT I WOULD FOR BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR. THE SPECIFICS ON THAT WILL PRESUMABLY WE CHANGED THE FEES THAT WERE PROTECTED IT R. HI- COLLECTED LAST YEAR SO THERE'D BE. I DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA LACKS A NUMBER OF TOXIC SITES THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP AT THE END TO DO IT I GUESS THAT'S MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS. THE MIX BETWEEN THE LAWYERS AND THE- CLEAN UP PEOPLE I DON'T I'M ENGINEERS I GUESS- ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THAT. I THINK IT'S SIX LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE FOURTEEN IS THAT RIGHT A DEPUTY NAY GRIEF. YES BUT ANOTHER THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US AND ELLOS FINE WITH THAT. YEAH WHEN IT COMES TO THE NATURE OF THE B. C. B. OUR OFFICE HAS NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL. OKAY- FINANCE SOMETHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION GIVEN THIS HISTORIC NATURE IS TO APPROVE AS REQUESTED. YEAH CHRISTIAN BUDGET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FURTHER AT NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AND- IF THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS HAPPY ADDRESS THAT'S- JUST CONGRATULATIONS ALL AROUND WE HAVE- THIS IS MY TWELFTH YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTOR WILLIAMS WE HAVE HAD PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AND I HAVE- SET AS A CHAIR OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND IT NEARLY A DAY THAT WE HAVE A TRIUMPHANT- ATMOS REALLY WE HAVE TODAY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF- TOXIC SUBSTANCE SO CONGRATULATIONS. TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF COULD WORK ALL AROUND ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A QUESTION BY CENTER STERN. OKAY.-THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AS SOMEBODY REPRESENTS THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY THEM. THE EX TOXIC WASTE SITE I'M GOING TO WITHHOLD ANY CONGRATULATIONS AT THIS POINT- I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE MY SKEPTICISM. GIVEN THE TREMENDOUS PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS THAT WE'VE p. AND THEN ALSO FORGIVE MY SKEPTICISM ON ANYTHING THAT- THAT THE BOEING COMPANY IS WILLING TO AGREE TO GIVEN THEIR HISTORIC INTRANSIGENCE ON. ON CLEANING UP WHAT HEIR RESPONSIBILITY IS IN PUTTING THEIR DOLLARS ON THE LINE SO I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I KNOW WILL BE GETTING DEEPER INTO THIS AT THE COMMUNITY FORUM ON JUNE SECOND- BUT THE FACT THAT- WHATEVER NEGOTIATION LED UP TO THIS AGREEMENT- WAS NOT DONE IN PUBLIC REQUIRES THE UTMOST SCRUTINY AT THIS POINT SO I'M NOT INTO. NOT PREPARED TO. TISSUE CONGRADULATIONS OR EVEN ANY- YEAH ANY ANY SORT OF TACIT ENDORSEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT TELL WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE DRILL DOWN ON SOME OF THESE KEY QUESTIONS SO LET ME LET ME JUST. GOIN ORDER HERE MAYBE DOCTOR WILLIAMS- OR- FOR THE DEPUTY WANTS TO TAKE A SHOT AT IT BUT- WHAT WHAT STANDARD IS D. T. S. C. IN THE EPA USING TO CLAIM. THAT THIS IS THE- STRICTEST POSSIBLE CLEANUP STANDARD. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR DIGGING IN IT IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT. EVERYBODY HAVE FAITH IN YOU IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THEN WHAT WE WERE GOING TO REQUIRE BOWING TO DO WE- THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE SIDE AND LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF IT DESERVE NOTHING LESS SO. YOU ASK ABOUT THE CLEANUP STANDARDS AND I DO NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT. ESTABLISHED A CLEANUP STANDARD BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DONE WE'LL SEE FOR SO WE ANTICIPATE APPLYING THE MOST RIGOROUS STANDARD POSSIBLE THE SITE. BUT THAT CLEANUP STANDARD WON'T BE FINAL UNTIL WE CERTIFY THE PROGRAM VARMINT IMPACT REPORT LATER THIS YEAR. BUT IT IS OUR GOAL TO REQUIRE BOWING TO CLEAN UP TO WHAT WE CALL A RESIDENT BEFORE YOU KNOW. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT AS THE STRICTEST. WE'RE REFERENCING THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CENTRAL. AND ALTHOUGH THAT WATER DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY. DIDN'T SPECIFY A STANDARD OUTLINED A RANGE OF POSSIBLE EXPOSURES. A RECREATION OR STAND A RESIDENTIAL STAND- A RESIDENTIAL SCENARIO- A RESIDENTS TO DIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL SCENARIOS WHERE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GARDENS IN THEIR BACKYARDS AND ALL OF THOSE SCENARIOS A RESIDENT WITH A 100% GARDEN SCENARIO DOES PRODUCE THE MOST STRINGENT CLEAN UP AND THAT'S WHAT THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR. NORMALLY WE SET OUR RISK BASED STANDARDS BASED ON LAND USE AND WE WOULD TYPICALLY APPLY RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP STANDARD TO THE SITE BUT OF COURSE WE WANT TO ENSURE EVEN MORE PROTECTIONS IN ANTICIPATION. OF POTENTIAL FUTURE LAND USE AND IN LIGHT OF THE EXTENSIVE CONTAMINATION AT THE SITE SO. I JUST FIVE POINT OF REFERENCE A RESIDENT WITH GARDEN CLEANUP STANDARD HAS ONLY BEEN USED IN JUST A HANDFUL OF SITES AROUND THE STATE. AND I WAS VERY HEARTENED TO SEE THAT STANDARD AND THAT'S WHAT WE IN THE COMMUNITY BEEN ASKING FOR A VERY LONG TIME JUST WHAT THE METHODOLOGY IS TO ARRIVE AT THAT RESIDENTIAL GARDEN STANDARD I THINK IS EVERYTHING THE DEVILS IN THOSE DETAILS- CAN YOU COMMENT ON. THE CONCERN AROUND- THIS STANDARDIZED RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY- A YOU YOU BRIEFLY MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS BUT HAS THE HAS THAT- THE ACRONYM IS THE CERAMBYCIDAE SERAM BEEN. ALTERED TO FIT. THEM THIS THIS CLEAN UP AGREEMENT. SO AS YOU WILL HOLD THE IT IS A COMPLEX CLEAN AND SO THE SCHRAM WILL STANDARDIZE RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY WAS DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS OF BOEING ABOUT HOW TO PERFORM. AND APPLY A RISK BASED CLEAN UP AT SFO. AND SO WE NEEDED TO DOCUMENT THIS METHODOLOGY BECAUSE AS I HIGHLIGHTED A RESIDENT WITH GARDENS STANDARD IS NOT NOT WIDELY USED. SO THE METHODS OUTLINED IN THE SCHRAM HAVE REMAINED THE SAME. WHAT DGSE ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE USING AUTHORITATIVE VALUES AND GUIDE. AND IN THIS CASE WE ARE USING VLUES IN GUIDANCE THAT IS CURATED AND UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO THE SCHRAMM WHO NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO REFLECT THOSE CHANGES. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU YOU DID NOT UPDATE THIS RAM TO ACCOMMODATE- AND THEN GO OVER THE AGREEMENT BUT THAT. IT'S OUT OF ITS IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT EPA GUIDANCE IS THAT THAT. NOT QUITE THE OPPOSITE OKAY WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T- NO MODIFY THE SCHRAMM TO REFLECT TO TRY TO GET TO AN ANSWER WE DIDN'T PREDETERMINE AND ANSWER THEM BACK INTO IT BUT NOT BY ANY MEANS- BUT YES THIS IS FULLY CONSISTENT WITH U. S. EPA GUIDE AND I IN FACT THEY USE A VERY SIMILAR PROCESS WHEN THEY USE THEIR RECENT RESEARCH- CALCULATORS. IN THAT THE BIG POINTS AS TO AFFORD HATED DATABASES AND DATA SOURCES AND USE WHATEVER DATA ARE PUBLISHED IN THOSE DATABASES AND DATA SOURCES AT A GIVEN TIME AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE REFLECTING THE UPDATES TO BOOK AND GUIDANCE AND ANY SOURCE DATA TO GO INTO THE TRAP. AND I AM CALCULATIONS VERY CALM AND I HAVE TO JUST SAY YOU KNOW I'M A PHD PHYSICIST I DON'T USE MY SCIENTIFIC CHOPS EVERY DAY IN MY WORK BUT THIS IS AN EXCEPTION IN THIS CASE I DID VERY DEEP INTO THE INTO THE CALCULATIONS UNTIL I WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE WORK WHICH THEN THE WORK OF OUR TOXICOLOGISTS AND I WAS CONFIDENT IN THE METHODS AND WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE CALCULATIONS AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY AND WE WANT EVERYONE TRAXXAS CLEAN UP TO BE CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE INSURING A HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE ENOUGH SO. WE'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE BEST SUPPORTING INFORMATION THAT LEADS TO THAT SO THAT WAS- ABOUT THE SCHRAM AVAILABLE CAN I JUST SO JUST. TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT THE- THIS TO JUST TO MAKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS VERY COMPLEX AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE FOR MYSELF AND FOR ALL THE CONSTITUENTS LISTENING- I UNDERSTAND THIS GETS DOWN TO HOW MUCH TOXICITY. CAN BE UP TAKE IN SAY. A TOMATO PLANT OR WHATEVER YOU MAY BE GROWING IN THAT GARDEN SUCH THAT IF YOU CONSUME THAT FOOD THAT FRUIT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT YOU WOULD. AT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFE I THINK THAT YOU HAVE NO- FORESEEABLE RISK OF- CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS SO. THE IS THE DISAGREEMENT OR THE SKEPTICISM- FROM COMMUNITY ADVOCATES ABOUT. HOW MUCH THAT PLANTS WILL UPTAKE- THAT THAT SORT OF TOXIC MATERIAL ON SITE HOW MUCH WOULD ACTUALLY END UP IN WHATEVER THAT TOMATO IS THAT PIECE OF FRUIT. YEAH SO. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE- SO THE COMBINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF CONTAMINATION THAT THAT IT WOULD TAKE UP AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF CONTAMINATION THAT'S LEFT ON THE PLATE SIMPLY BY. YOU KNOW HAVING SOIL EVEN EVEN IF YOU WASH YOUR PRODUCE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO REALLY REALLY SPEND ENSURE OR VEGETABLES THAT STILL HAVE SOME RESIDUAL SOIL SO THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT ARE TO GO INTO- THE CALCULATION THAT'S- TWO OF THE THINGS THAT GO INTO THE CALCULATION SO YES. WHEN WE GO AND WE LOOK AT THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS THAT SAY THIS IS HOW MUCH LETTUCE AND WE TALK ABOUT LETTERS BECAUSE LETTERS DOES TEND TO TAKE UP MORE SOIL. FIRST OF ALL TAKE UP MORE CONTAMINATION AND- JUST SERVICE AREA WIDE PICK OF- OBSERVE. A LOT OF SOIL MIGHT ADHERE TO IT SO IT'S A VERY CONSERVATIVE WAY WAY. TO DO TH CALCULATIONS SO WE BASE EVERYTHING ON LETTUCE AND IN THE CASE OF LETTUCE- ONE OF THE VARIABLES ONE OF THE DATA SOURCES DID CHANGE ON. OVER THE YEARS AND SO WE'RE PASSAGE. PRECISELY WHERE THE CONCERN IS. I APPRECIATE THAT M. LISTEN WHAT WILL HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE OFFER OF A OF A BRIEFING TO DIG DEEPER I WOULD SAY. JUST FOR TO BUILD THE MOST PUBLIC TRUST POSSIBLE. I'D LIKE TO HAVE WHATEVER THOSE BRIEFINGS ARE DONE IN A IN A PUBLIC FORMAT- BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY HAS MANY QUESTIONS SO- I WILL I WILL DEFER THAT TO THE TO THE JUNE SECOND EVENT AND TAKE- WHATEVER- BACK UP TECHNICAL INFORMATION YOU ALL HAVE IN THIS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED PAGE AGREEMENT- THAT WILL BE. REVIEWING WITH OUR TEAM IN GREAT DETAIL I DID WANT TO NOTE HOWEVER FOR THE PURPOSES THE ITEM TODAY MAYBE THE CHAIR COULD. COULD CLARIFY WELL I'M WITHHOLDING. MY JUDGMENT ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT AND AGAIN HEARTENED ABOUT RESIDENTIAL GARDEN BUT WE WANT THAT TO BE REAL AND DEPENDABLE AND THAT LD US TO BE. SAFE IF IT TRULY IS GROWN THERE- THAT- THAT WHAT WERE THE BUDGET ITEM TODAY IS NOT ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW YOU THE M. O. U. ITSELF FOR ANY TACIT APPROVAL OF THIS AGREEMENT. BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT- ENFORCEMENT- A HAVING ENOUGH STAFF O LOOK AFTER THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ISSUES. AND THAT- THE COST THE POSITIONS AS I SEE HERE- WILL BE FUNDED. THROUGH COST RECOVERY FROM THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES SO GET CAN YOU OR OR MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT. JUST COMMENT ON ON THAT JUST TO MAKE CLEAR THAT. THAT THESE POSITIONS WERE FUNDING TODAY ARE SORT OF NO REGRETS ENFORCEMENT POSITIONS. THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY A TACIT APPROVAL OR SOME- ENDORSEMENT THE AGREEMENT BUT INSTEAD- ARE POSITIONS THAT WE BE FUNDING UP FRONT AND THEN WOULD BE IN THE COST WOULD BE THEN RECOVERED FROM DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NASA AS WELL AS BOEING SO I HAVE THAT RIGHT. LUCKILY I CENTER STERN WE HAVE BRIAN- BROWN WHO IS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN PROPOSAL BEFORE US IS SIMPLY FOR THE FOURTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS TO THE TUNE OF. OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT AND IN A MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL TRUST ACCOUNT OF FOR- PERNAH POSITIONS WHICH WILL BE REIMBURSED BY THE- AT THIS IN THIS CASE THE- THREE PARTIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN SANTA SUSANNA. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN SENATOR STERN- THAT IS CORRECT THE FUNDING THAT IS BEING REQUESTED IS TO SUPPORT- THE CLEANUP OF THE ENTIRE THANK TO OVERSEE THE WORK THAT THE THREE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. WILL ENGAGE IN TO CLEAN UP THE- DECLINE OF THE SITE NESB FUNNY NEVER REQUESTING FOR THE POSITIONS. WILL BE RUEFULLY REIMBURSED BY THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY THROUGH CONTRACTOR FEDERAL FUNDING. SO UP FRONT FUNDING. FOR FOR CLEAN UP OVERSIGHT THAT THAT THEN WON'T BE AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE- BASED ON THE REIMBURSEMENT- FROM THE RESPONSE PARTIES. THAT'S RIGHT WE ISSUE INVOICES- OR THOSE CONTRACT THAT WE DO WE DO TECHNICALLY GET PAID ARREARS BUT IT IS FULLY REIMBURSED AND WILL NOT AFFECT THE- THE FEES FOR EXAMPLE THE FEES THAT WERE INCREASED WHO ARE OF THE REFORM LEGISLATION LAST YEAR OKAY UNDERSTOOD. ALL RIGHT I I'M I'M COMFORTABLE AT THIS POINT WITH WITH THE ISSUE THAT THE ITEM BEFORE US MISTER CHAIR BUT- APPRECIATE IT YEAH DR WILLIAMSON AND THE REST OF THE TEAM. YOUR OPENNESS TO DIGGING IN DEEPER HERE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO. TO KICKING THE TIRES ON WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING- AN ONGOING MORAL THAT THAT WE STILL HAVE NOT. FULLY REPAID TO THIS COMMUNITY SO- IN ORDER GETTING THAT DONE I'LL BE SPORTING HERE TODAY. I APPRECIATE THE- EVERYONE ELSE I KNOW THIS WAS IN THE SPECIFICS OF THE AGENDA ITEM BUT I THOUGHT GIVEN THE- PROXIMITY TO THE- THE HEARING AND THE CONTINUATION FROM LAST WEEK THAT IT WAS WELL WORTH IT.

INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS- ON TESTIMONY- I'M ASKING MEMBERS OF PUBLIC PP BRIEF LET'S START WITH THE WITNESSES IN OUR ROOM. TWELVE HUNDRED HERE AT THE- STREET BUILDING PLEASE COMPORT. THAT AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND STAFF RECALL MUSTARD AND AUTO WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND. A FIRST I WANNA. COMMENT ON TWO OF THE ITEMS NUMBER THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN BUT I WANT TO START BY THANKING SENATOR STERN FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ON EXTREME HEAT- I. HAVE BEEN LOBBYING SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN TO RESTORE FUNDING TO THE URBAN GREENING PROGRAM EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND HAD IMMERSED MYSELF IN IT WHAT I CAN LEARN ABOUT EXTREME HEAT MOSTLY FROM THE LUSKIN. SCHOOL AT UCLA. AND YOU HAVE TO START. WHERE PEOPLE LIVE FIRST SO THAT HE PUNKEDBY THE IS GOOD PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THEIR HOUSES TO GO TO THE COOLING CENTERS ARE RESILIENT CENTERS WHEN THEY HAVE UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND OTHER FRAILTIES THAT MAKE THEM VULNERABLE TO EXTREME HEAT IT'S THE SAME UNDERLYING POPULATION IT WAS WELL OVERLOOKED COVE IT. SO I WOULD SUGGEST TREE CANOPY AND GREENING AROUND HOMES AND COMMUNITIES BEFORE WE- BUILD BRICK AND MORTAR SOMEWHERE ELSE- I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT THIS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN IT'S THE AB THIRTY ONE STATEWIDE LOCAL PARK PROGRAM THERE'S NO FUNDING IN THE JANUARY BUDGET FOR THIS PROGRAM. THERE'S NO FUNDING THAT I COULD SEE IN THE SENATE PROPOSAL. AND THIS IS A PROBABLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL LOCAL PARK PROGRAM. IN THE UNITED STATES IT HAS BEEN AWARDED ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN CREATED THREE HUNDRED PARKS HAS BEEN RECEIVED EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN REQUEST- WE JUST TALKED TO THE PART A COUPLE DAYS AGO. THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE SCORES OF PARK PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO BE FUNDED AND SCORED VERY WELL. BUT THE LAST ROUND OF FUNDING WHICH WAS THE LAST OF THE MONEY. THE PROGRAM SIMPLY RAN OUT OF MONEY AND THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T GET AWARDED SO I'D REALLY LIKE TO PASS THE SENATE TO TAKE A- CLOSE LOOK AT THAT THIS PROGRAM CHECKS EVERY SINGLE BOX. IMAGINABLE FROM EQUITABLE ACCESS EXTREME HEAT INTERVENTION OF FLOOD MEDICATION OF HUMAN AND MENTAL HEALTH- YOU KNOW COVERT LAID BARE HOW IMPORTANT LOCAL PARKS ARE. SO I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE ANY FUNDING AND- LASTLY I'D WANT TO TALK TO ABOUT GREEN SCHOOLYARDS- CENTER WELL WHY CASKEY I. ALSO QUESTIONED CAL FIRE BEING MANY OF. OPERATOR OF THIS PROGRAM WE'VE DONE TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLYARDS IN NEW YORK CITY FINISHED OVER TWENTY YEARS. AND FIVE IN OAKLAND THREE OF WHICH ARE FINISHED IN TO WILL BE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. THEY'RE ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS EACH TO DO AND WE LOOK AT THEM AS PART PROJECTS SO THAT WE CAN PUT PERMEABLE SURFACES. CAPTURE WHATEVER STORMWATER THAT HITS THE GROUND WHICH WHICH ABSOLUTELY NEED TO DO WE CAN'T SQUANDER ANY WATER. ANYWHERE IN THE STATE AND WE OF COURSE HAVE TREE CANOPIED MODERN. PLAY EQUIPMENT WE LOOK WE ARE PARK DEVELOPERS THAT'S THE WAY WE LOOK AT SCHOOL CAMPUSES. YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE STUDENTS THE FACULTY THE BOARD OF THIS IS NOT A SINGLE WHATEVER WE DO IF WE PICK ONE IT EXISTING PROGRAM IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW. IT'S A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE WE NEED A ONE STOP SHOPPING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO GREEN THEIR SCHOOLYARDS- THAT COULD BE REPRESENTED BY MULTI AGENCIES LIKE US G. C. DOES. BUT HAS THE ABILITY. TO COVER EVERYTHING THAT'S NEEDED BECAUSE WHEN WE DO SCHOOLYARDS IN OAKLAND WE HAVE TO STITCH TOGETHER GRANTS FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT PLACES. AND THEN HOPE TO GOD THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS WILLING TO DO A JOINT USE AGREEMENTS OF THE COMMISSION IF YOU CAN USE THAT AFTER SCHOOL HOURS. SO OFTEN THERE I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH YOUR STAFF AND- BUT THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU NECKS.

SECOND ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NEEDED TO PREVENT DEATHS AND PREPARE FOR THE PREDICTED INCREASE IN HEAT WAVES AND POWER OUTAGES. LASTLY THERE'S A DIRE NEED TO FUND COORDINATED ADAPTATION STRATEGIES LIKE COOPER HEATING COOL ROOFS NATURAL AND MECHANICAL SHEET.
