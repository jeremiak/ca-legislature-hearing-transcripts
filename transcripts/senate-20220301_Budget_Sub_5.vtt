LIKE TO MENTION A FEW OF THESE

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:55.041
IMPACTS. FIRST WE'RE WORKING TO

ADDRESS. NEW WORKFORCE DEMANDS

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:59.278
IN SECTORS SUCH AS HEALTH CARE

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.280
AND ENERGY WHILE ALSO FACING

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.716
UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES RELATED

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:06.252
TO HIRING AND RETENTION. SECOND

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.720
WHILE WE WORK TO SUPPORT SHARED

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:09.755
VALUES AROUND CARBON NEUTRALITY

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:10.957
AND CLIMATE JUSTICE FOR

THIS TRANSITION IN INDUSTRIES

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.066
AND TO DO SO IN A MANNER THAT

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:23.870
PRESUMES LESS AND LISTENS MORE.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.805
THIRD AS WHICH AND WE FEEL

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.673
GRATEFUL FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.009
AND PROMISING FUTURE WE MUST DO

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.611
SO WHILE FOCUSING ON SOME

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.212
DIFFICULT TRUTHS THAT THE

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:38.951
SOCIAL INJUSTICES CONTINUE TO

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:41.153
EXIST AND HAVE GROWN OVER THE

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.589
LAST SEVERAL DECADES. IT IS FACT

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:44.457
THAT THESE INEQUITIES

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.226
DISPROPORTIONATELY ADVERSELY AND

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:49.328

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:59.705
BUT OFTEN FORGOTTEN OR USE. IT

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:00.907
IS ALSO A FACT THAT THE

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:02.775
DISCONNECTION AND POVERTY THAT

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.177
INEQUITY PERPETUATES RESULTING

GROWING SOCIAL COSTS FOR

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:10.049
EVERYONE AND LIMITS AND PLACES

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:11.284

OUR EVOLVING ECONOMY WILL ALSO

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.700
LIBERATING OURSELVES FROM THE

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:28.768
STUBBORN AND PERVASIVE

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.503
INEQUITIES. AND SPEAKING OF

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:32.939
INEQUITY WE HEAR THIS TERM IS SO

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:35.007
MUCH THESE DAYS IN THE MEDIA AND

OUR OWN POLICY AND OPERATIONAL

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.347
DISCUSSIONS. BUT THE GROSS

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.115
INJUSTICES ON THE COSTS THAT

INEQUITY CREATES WON'T DISAPPEAR

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.420
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TO

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:49.288
DISAPPEAR OR BECAUSE WE PAT

COUNTRY WERE SO STRETCHED THEN.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:06.685
WERE SO STRESSED OUT OUR BY THE

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:11.023
LEVELS OF INDIVIDUALS COMING IN

THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF-

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:21.834
BRINGING WORKERS FROM OUT OF

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.471
CRITICAL ROLES AND THIS WAS

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:27.473
DURING AN EMERGENCY. THIS

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:29.541

ACTUALLY WORKING THEMSELVES OUT

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:32.354
OF A JOB. IF WE PRODUCE OIL HERE

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:33.288
THEY KEEP THEIR JOB AND THEIR

CAP THESE WELLS WHERE THEY GO

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:51.206
AFTER THAT. THIS IS A GREAT

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:53.375
QUESTION I IT THE BEAUTY OF THAT

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:54.977
OF THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES- IS

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.478
THE DISPATCH MODEL- AND AS

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:57.813
WORKERS I MEAN IT'S A VERY

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.948
VOLATILE INDUSTRY- WHERE

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:01.483
WORKERS. GO TO WORK ON A

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.185
PROJECT- THE PROJECTS OVER THEY

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:04.386
GO BACK TO THE HIRING ON THEIR

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:06.522
DISPATCH OF THE WORK SO- THE

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:07.523
INTENTION HERE WITH WELL WELL

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.058
CAPPING IS TO BUILD IT INTO

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.826
EXISTING. APPRENTICESHIP

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.327
PROGRAMS THAT SERVES KERN COUNTY

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:13.762
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:14.630
WHERE WE'LL BE DOING THIS WHILE

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.632
CAPPING. SO I THINK THAT

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:18.167
INTERESTINGLY THAT THAT THE

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:19.468
OLDEST MODEL FOR WORKFORCE

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.837
DEVELOPMENT- PROBABLY IN HISTORY

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:24.406
IS THE MOST RELEVANT ONE FOR

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.341
TODAY AND THE CAN THE KINDS OF-

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:26.942
CHANGE THAT WORD THAT WE'RE

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.878
FACING. SO DO THOSE JOBS COMING

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:31.847
OUT OF CONTRACTS FROM CAL JIM.

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:34.650
WOOD WAS DAVID OVERSEE DOT. THE

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:35.818
KALENJIN CORRECT I BELIEVE

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:38.253
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY IN THE

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.488
CONSTRUCTION TRADES HAVE THIS

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:41.290
SKILL SET I MEAN I MY

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:29.843
INTO ALL OF THAT. THE ADDAMS

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:32.045
SHARED- AS YOU MENTIONED

01:42:32.112 --> 01:42:34.314
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THE STATE'S

01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:36.483
YOU AYE PAYROLL TAX BASE INSTEAD

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:37.584
OF SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT

01:42:37.651 --> 01:42:39.253
IS THE LOWEST ALLOWABLE AMOUNT

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:41.822
UNDER FEDERAL LAW- MANY STATES

01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:44.558
HAVE HIGHER TAX BASES- BUT A LOT

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:46.760
OF THOSE STATES TO. TURN LEVY A

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.929
LOWER RATES- AGAINST THAT THEIR

01:42:48.996 --> 01:42:51.265
HIGHER TAX BASES BUT IN GENERAL-

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:52.566
IF THE STATE WERE TO INCREASE

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:54.601
THE U. I. PAYROLL TAX BASED IT

01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:56.537
WOULD HAVE HAD THE EFFECT OF.

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:58.605
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.240
THE STATE YOU I TRUST FUND WHICH

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:01.642
HEADING INTO THE PANDEMIC WHAT

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:02.976
ELSE WOULD PUT THE STATE IN A

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:04.177
BETTER POSITION TO CONTINUE

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:05.279
PAYING BENEFITS FOR A LONGER

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:07.281
PERIOD. PRIOR TO TURNING TO THE

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:11.752
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR LOANS- I

01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:12.819
WILL CAUTION THOUGH THAT. EVEN

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:15.255
HAVE THE STATE TAKEN. STEPS TO

01:43:15.322 --> 01:43:16.790
IMPROVE THE FISCAL POSITION OF

01:43:16.857 --> 01:43:18.525
THE U. I TRUST FUND. THE

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:19.960
PANDEMIC WAS SO ENORMOUS IN

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:22.129
MAGNITUDE IT'S LIKELY THAT UNDER

01:43:22.195 --> 01:43:23.697
EVEN THE BEST OF SCENARIOS- THE

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:25.065
STATE WOULD HAVE HAD TO REACH

01:43:25.132 --> 01:43:26.233
OUT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:28.101
CONTINUE PAYING LOANS. ARE TO

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:30.604
CONTINUE PAYING BENEFITS- BUT-

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:32.339
IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT AT THIS

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:33.307
POINT. AS A RESULT THE STATE

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:35.142
WOULD HAVE NOT FEWER OUTSTANDING

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:37.978
LOANS- TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:40.847
FOR TECHNICAL WORK. OKAY FOR NOW

01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:45.719
WITH THAT SAID- NUMBERS. SENATE

01:43:45.786 --> 01:43:49.289
CRITICIZING THE CENTER TO GROW.

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:50.824
THIS IS PROBABLY QUESTIONS MUCH

01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:54.294
FOR FINANCES THE ONLY OPEN- BUT

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:55.362
FOR SOME REASON I FEEL LIKE

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:57.464
DIRECTED TO THE OLE OLE I'M A

01:43:57.531 --> 01:44:01.868
LITTLE- BUT I GUESS I PROMISE I

01:44:01.935 --> 01:44:04.471
HAVE WITH WITH LIABILITIES ON

01:44:04.538 --> 01:44:05.973
THE BALANCE SHEET IN IN ANY

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.774
ORGANIZATION PUBLIC OR PRIVATE.

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:11.812
IS THERE THE BEST. RESOLVED

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:15.782
OFTENTIMES BY- KEEPING THEM.

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:17.651
KEEPING THE BUSINESS ON THE

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:19.286
BALLOT SHEET METAL WORDS TAKING.

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:21.822
AN ASSET IN THE LIQUIDATING IT

01:44:21.888 --> 01:44:23.390
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO A

01:44:23.457 --> 01:44:25.492
TO PAY OFF THE LIABILITY THAT'S

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:26.827
ON THE BALANCE SHEET SO YOU

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:29.596
BASICALLY HAVE. YOU KNOW A NET-

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:31.198
THE NET ZERO RESULTS IN YOUR

01:44:31.264 --> 01:44:36.937
COLLEGE. THE IDEA OF SUPPLYING-

01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:39.406
A LONG TERM STATE CREDIT AT THE

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:42.709
BUSINESSES TO HELP THEM TO HE

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.611
NOTED TO OFFSET THAT THE FEDERAL

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:49.049
COSTS EIGHT AGREES- INNOVATIVE-

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:52.185
BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT SHIFTING- A

01:44:52.252 --> 01:44:57.357
BALANCE SHEET. LIABILITY OVER TO

01:44:57.424 --> 01:45:00.627

WE HAVE ONGOING COSTS WHO WAS

01:45:02.529 --> 01:45:03.430
MOST CERTAINLY HAVE RISING

01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:05.298
ONGOING COSTS IN THE FUTURE WE

01:45:05.365 --> 01:45:06.967
MOST CERTAINLY WILL HAVE A

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:08.368
PERIOD OF TIME IN THE FUTURE WE

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:11.905
ARE EXPERIENCING SURPLUSES SO.

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:14.608
THAT WITH THAT BACKDROP MY

01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:21.915
THINKING- HAVE YOU LOOKED AT. IS

01:45:21.982 --> 01:45:25.552
THIS SOME KIND OF- OPPORTUNITY.

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:28.689
HI I'M TO USE FIXED ASSETS THAT

BY. DIFFERENT INTEREST COSTS

01:46:25.345 --> 01:46:28.148

SOMEBODY COULD EXPLAIN IT TO ME

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:46.760
I WOULD. MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:47:46.827 --> 01:47:48.428
THAT WE PAY ROUGHLY SIX POINT 9%

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:50.096

01:48:06.112 --> 01:48:08.048
ESTIMATE ON MY BRIEF

01:48:08.114 --> 01:48:09.516

LIKE 65% HIGHER THAN ALMOST ANY

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:18.925
OTHER STATE IN THE NATION

CALIFORNIA LEADS THE HIGHEST TAX

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:26.733
INCREASE FOR EMPLOYMENT. SO- IS

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:29.069
THAT TRUE OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE

01:48:29.135 --> 01:48:30.570
THE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LIKE

01:48:30.637 --> 01:48:32.606

THAT. THE PANDEMIC TARGETED

DIFFERENT- ELIGIBILITY RULES

02:07:24.903 --> 02:07:27.139
THEN THE STATES YOU AYE PROGRAM.

02:07:27.206 --> 02:07:29.575
AND THIS PROGRAM- ENDED IN THE

02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:31.710

02:07:39.218 --> 02:07:41.420
THAT THE NEED FOR STATE ANTI

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.788

PANDEMIC AND CENTER GROVE I

02:07:50.062 --> 02:07:51.463

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:14.353
THE AMOUNT OF FRAUDULENT

A YEAR AND A HALF OLD DURING THE

HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC- AS

02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:40.719
EVIDENCE OF A FRAUD CULTURE AT

02:12:40.786 --> 02:12:42.354
EDT I YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THAT

02:12:42.421 --> 02:12:43.889

DON'T ALSO WAY COMMONSENSE BUT

02:12:52.698 --> 02:12:54.032
WE DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT AT

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:56.735
THE DATA- WHEN I RE READ THE

02:12:56.802 --> 02:12:58.203
STRAIGHT TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS

02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:59.071
WHICH WAS ACTUALLY RELEASED

02:12:59.137 --> 02:13:01.073
BEFORE I CAME TO EDT ABOUT FOUR

02:13:01.139 --> 02:13:02.674

ARE RUNNING COUNTER TO THE

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:11.650
STRIKE TEAM- I THINK THAT THE

02:13:11.717 --> 02:13:13.118
STRIKE TEAM WAS TALKING ABOUT.

02:13:13.185 --> 02:13:14.386
PEOPLE'S YOU KNOW THE FRAUD

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:16.455
CULTURE IS TALKING ABOUT THE

02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:18.623
WORKERS THAT EDT WHEN THERE WAS

02:13:18.690 --> 02:13:21.593
A MANUAL PROCESS- I CAN IMAGINE

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:23.562
THAT THAT'S AT LEAST ONE OF THE

02:13:23.628 --> 02:13:25.230
REASONS WHY THE STRIKE TEAM

02:13:25.297 --> 02:13:27.666
SUGGESTED THAT WE USE A VENDOR

02:13:27.733 --> 02:13:29.101
THAT MEETS YOU KNOW FEDERAL.

02:13:29.167 --> 02:13:30.936
IDENTITY STANDARD ID ME OF

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:32.871
COURSE- BECAUSE IT TAKES A

02:13:32.938 --> 02:13:36.441
MANUAL PROCESS OUT OF- OUT OF IT

02:13:36.508 --> 02:13:38.343
AND IT ELIMINATES ANY FRAUD

02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:41.146
CULTURE- I WOULD I WOULD THINK-

02:13:41.213 --> 02:13:43.648

THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING FRAUD

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:55.560

02:13:59.898 --> 02:14:02.134
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE I YOU KNOW

SYSTEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:05.003
AND THEY'RE VERY SOPHISTICATED

02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:06.237
WE DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHAT

02:19:06.304 --> 02:19:08.339
THEY'RE GOING TO DO. NEXT ANDI

02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:10.141

I MENTIONED SO AFTER C ENDED SO

02:19:18.450 --> 02:19:20.118
TO THE L. A. O.'S POINT ABOUT

02:19:20.185 --> 02:19:24.556

YOU KNOW THIS IS AFTER PRO ENDED

02:19:26.858 --> 02:19:28.927
AT ONE STAGE ABOUT SCAMMERS

EXPLOITING JOB BOARDS. AND

02:19:31.362 --> 02:19:32.997
SOCIAL MEDIA SITES TO

UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT YOU

WOULD BE AMAZED TO SEE WHAT WE

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:46.211
ARE PROVIDING AS FAR AS WHAT'S

02:19:46.277 --> 02:19:47.612
ON THE DARK WEB IN THE CHATTER

02:19:47.679 --> 02:19:49.147
IN THE ATTEMPT- I'M GOVERNMENT

02:19:49.214 --> 02:19:52.150
BENEFITS FRAUD RIGHT NOW- BUT

02:19:52.217 --> 02:19:53.418
I'D I'D PROBABLY TALK TOO MUCH

02:19:53.485 --> 02:19:55.754
BUT I CAN LET THE CIO- MAYBE

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:57.756
DISCUSS SOME OF THE NUANCES OF

02:19:57.822 --> 02:20:04.162
THE TECHNOLOGY- IF THAT DOESN'T

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:06.931
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- YES IF YOU

02:20:06.998 --> 02:20:08.666
HAVE. IF YOU HAVE SOME.

02:20:08.733 --> 02:20:09.801
UNANSWERED THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:13.238
TO THAT. YES GOOD MORNING- READ

02:20:13.304 --> 02:20:17.142
A GUY ET SO WHAT YOU NEED IT WAS

02:20:17.208 --> 02:20:18.710
AS IF WE DOWNGRADE TO ELIMINATE

02:20:18.777 --> 02:20:20.078
THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SERVICE

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:21.946
IS OUR ABILITY TO PROVE THE

02:20:22.013 --> 02:20:24.649
IDENTITY WE USED ID ME AS AN

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:26.151
IDENTITY PROOFING TOOL

02:20:26.217 --> 02:20:28.019
POTENTIALLY STOLEN IDENTITIES

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:30.421
USE BY ORGAN ORGANIZED CRIMINALS

02:20:30.488 --> 02:20:32.023
WILL NOT BE DISCOVERED DURING

02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:34.092
THE SCREENING PROCESS BECAUSE I

02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:35.426
NEED ME WILL ONLY BE CHECKING IF

02:20:35.493 --> 02:20:37.095
THE PERSON SPACE SUBMITTING THE

02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:39.998
IDENTIFICATION. PROOF MATCHES

02:20:40.064 --> 02:20:41.866
THE GOVERNMENT IDENTIFICATION

02:20:41.933 --> 02:20:44.335
PAPERWORK NOT IF THIS PERSON HAS

02:20:44.402 --> 02:20:46.437
TRIED MANY TIMES TO BEFORE USING

02:20:46.504 --> 02:20:47.939
OTHER IDENTITIES WHAT HAD

02:20:48.006 --> 02:20:49.707
HAPPENED I THAT I DIDN'T EACH UP

02:20:49.774 --> 02:20:52.177
FOUND IS THAT ONE PERSON COULD

02:20:52.243 --> 02:20:54.579
BE USING THE SAME PHOTO AND THE

02:20:54.646 --> 02:20:56.080
SAME DRIVERS LICENSE WITH

02:20:56.147 --> 02:20:57.882
DIFFERENT NAMES AND THAT'S HOW

02:20:57.949 --> 02:20:59.784
THEY WERE ABLE TO CATCH THAT YOU

02:20:59.851 --> 02:21:01.686
KNOW THIS ONE PERSON WHAT IT

02:21:01.753 --> 02:21:04.856
SUBMITTED FIVE TEN OR MULTIPLE-

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:09.427
IDENTITIES DEBRA. FILE-

02:21:09.494 --> 02:21:12.330
UNEMPLOYMENT. SO THE DAY THAT

02:21:12.397 --> 02:21:16.401
HAVE BEEN. WITH WITH USING ID ME

02:21:16.467 --> 02:21:19.437
- YOU ALL FEEL COMFORTABLE A TO

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:21.139
CONTINUE TO USE IT EXCITING

02:21:21.206 --> 02:21:23.174
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE QUESTION

02:21:23.241 --> 02:21:25.109
IS THAT THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE

02:21:25.176 --> 02:21:28.713
CREATED BOM BOM BY ID ME YOU

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:32.450
FEEL THAT. THOSE ARE NOT- SO

02:21:32.517 --> 02:21:34.686
SERIOUS THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:37.188
TO USE IT ME. SENATE OUR

02:21:37.255 --> 02:21:39.791
IDENTITY VARIOUS- WITH IDEALLY I

02:21:39.858 --> 02:21:45.864
WOULDN'T WITH EDT- I WOULD SAY

02:21:45.930 --> 02:21:47.365
THAT WE TAKE THAT VERY

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:49.701
SERIOUSLY- WHICH IS WHY WE ARE

02:21:49.767 --> 02:21:51.336
TALKING TO OTHER STATES AS WELL

02:21:51.402 --> 02:21:53.204
AS THE ID YOU KNOW AS WELL AS

02:21:53.271 --> 02:21:55.406
THE ID ME ABOUT PUTTING IN PLACE

02:21:55.473 --> 02:21:57.075
BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:58.743
WHICH TAKES OUT THE FACIAL

02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:00.211
RECOGNITION PIECE OF IT IT'S

02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:03.248
ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- ID

02:22:03.314 --> 02:22:06.017
NY HAS IMPLEMENTED- A PROCESS BY

02:22:06.084 --> 02:22:07.652
WHICH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DO

02:22:07.719 --> 02:22:10.154
UPLOAD A SELFIE BECAUSE THAT IS

02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:11.856
PROBABLY THE ROUTE THAT MOST

02:22:11.923 --> 02:22:13.324
PEOPLE WOULD GO BECAUSE IT'S

02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:14.292
QUICKER TO UPLOAD A SELFIE AND

02:22:14.359 --> 02:22:16.361
THEN YOU CAN DELETE IT AFTER.

02:22:16.427 --> 02:22:17.829
YOU KNOW THAT IF THERE IS AN

02:22:17.896 --> 02:22:19.264
ISSUE WITH THAT SELFIE THAT

02:22:19.330 --> 02:22:20.965
LET'S SAY YOU MATCH WITH

02:22:21.032 --> 02:22:23.234
SOMEONE- FROM ANOTHER STATE THAT

02:22:23.301 --> 02:22:26.604
A LIVE PERSON WILL COME ON TO

02:22:26.671 --> 02:22:28.773
THAT WILL APPEAR ON YOUR SCREEN-

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.275
AND COME ON TO THE SCREEN TO

02:22:30.341 --> 02:22:32.543
WALK YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS SO

02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:34.012
THERE IS NO UNINTENDED

02:22:34.078 --> 02:22:36.314
CONSEQUENCES THAT THAT IS PART

02:22:36.381 --> 02:22:38.416
OF- WHAT THEY ARE DOING I

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:39.217
BELIEVE FOR THE FEDERAL

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:41.552
GOVERNMENT AND AGAIN. THAT IS

02:22:41.619 --> 02:22:42.987
THE DIRECTION THAT WE ARE HEADED

02:22:43.054 --> 02:22:44.889
IN WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:22:44.956 --> 02:22:46.424
THAT WE ARE MAKING THE RIGHT

02:22:46.491 --> 02:22:48.259
DECISION YOU DON'T BASED ON ALSO

02:22:48.326 --> 02:22:50.161
WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING BUT

02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:51.496
YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED LAST

02:22:51.562 --> 02:22:53.264

ISSUE WITH US FOLLOWING- THE

02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:58.369
PROCESS THAT THE IRS IS- THAT IS

02:22:58.436 --> 02:23:02.407

HEARING THE WORLD IS NOT GOING

02:23:57.161 --> 02:23:58.997
TO BE THE SAME. AGAIN I DON'T

02:23:59.063 --> 02:24:02.133

REALLY OPENED UP OUR EYES I

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:05.636
THINK TO SOME OF THE-

02:24:05.703 --> 02:24:07.438
TRANSGRESSIONS AND MISGIVINGS OF

02:24:07.505 --> 02:24:10.308

MODERNIZATION SYSTEM. AND IT

02:24:31.229 --> 02:24:34.399
WILL BE IDENTITY- VERIFICATION

02:24:34.465 --> 02:24:38.469
WITHIN THAT- THE BSM PROJECTS SO

LABOR WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT.

02:57:58.167 --> 02:58:01.170
UNDER THE LARGER UMBRELLA BUT

02:58:01.237 --> 02:58:03.072
THE DIRECTED MINISTRATION OF THE

02:58:03.139 --> 02:58:05.741
PROGRAM'S GOES TO ANY OF THESE

02:58:05.808 --> 02:58:07.143
WORK FOR SERVICES BRANCH THE

02:58:07.209 --> 02:58:09.245
EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL AND

02:58:09.311 --> 02:58:10.679
THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD

02:58:10.746 --> 02:58:13.182
. OKAY THIS WILL SOUND DIFFERENT

02:58:13.249 --> 02:58:19.021
THE OIL WORKERS- THE TERMINOLOGY

02:58:19.088 --> 02:58:20.156
THAT'S USED HERE IS REALLY

02:58:20.222 --> 02:58:22.158
DIFFERENT SOCKS USE ME FOR IF I

02:58:22.224 --> 02:58:24.060
GOT THESE CONFUSED BUT THIS

02:58:24.126 --> 02:58:26.462
DESCRIBES IT AS DISPLACED BROWN

02:58:26.529 --> 02:58:29.498
DISSIPATED- ONCE WORD SAYS

02:58:29.565 --> 02:58:31.700

02:58:31.767 --> 02:58:33.469
WORDS ARE ANTICIPATED

02:58:33.536 --> 02:58:36.205
DISPLACEMENT- AND THOSE ARE

02:58:36.272 --> 02:58:38.240
REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY

02:58:38.307 --> 02:58:41.243
THAT WE HEARD EARLIER BY MISTER

02:58:41.310 --> 02:58:45.014

02:58:45.081 --> 02:58:46.849
THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO CAP THE

02:58:46.916 --> 02:58:49.919
OIL WELLS THAT THERE WILL BE A

02:58:49.985 --> 02:58:52.721

QUESTIONS. SURE YES- SELECTED

02:59:20.483 --> 02:59:21.817
THE ONE THAT MISTER RANEY WAS

02:59:21.884 --> 02:59:23.953
DESCRIBING EARLIER WAS VERY

02:59:24.019 --> 02:59:26.355
SPECIFIC TO A PILOT FOR OIL

02:59:26.422 --> 02:59:28.657
CAFFEINE AND WHICH WE WILL BE

02:59:28.724 --> 02:59:31.994
SEEKING ACTUALLY PLACE PEOPLE

02:59:35.131 --> 02:59:36.899

DISPLACED FROM AN INDUSTRY AND

02:59:48.410 --> 02:59:50.846
THAT IN THE FUTURE WE ANTICIPATE

THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE

03:00:05.728 --> 03:00:08.531
BUT ALSO OUR FUNDING WILL ACT

03:00:08.597 --> 03:00:11.934
FINE OTHERS- GRANTS THAT WILL

03:00:12.001 --> 03:00:13.602
SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD HELP

03:00:13.669 --> 03:00:20.910
THESE WORKERS FIND NEW CAREERS.

03:00:20.976 --> 03:00:21.877
IN OTHER SECTORS AND INDUSTRIES

03:00:21.944 --> 03:00:26.815

THE TRAINING OF THEY NEED WHICH

03:00:58.314 --> 03:01:00.649
APPEARS TO BE VERY LITTLE- TO GO

03:01:00.716 --> 03:01:03.085
INTO THESE NEW INTO THESE NEW

03:01:03.152 --> 03:01:05.721
SECTORS INTO THESE NEW JOBS SO.

03:01:05.788 --> 03:01:07.756
THAT PART MAKES ME YOU KNOW

03:01:07.823 --> 03:01:10.492
UNCOMFORTABLE TO DECLARE THAT

03:01:10.559 --> 03:01:12.394
THERE WILL BE DISPLACED WORKERS

03:01:12.461 --> 03:01:14.997

GIVE THEM YOU KNOW SOME SOME

03:01:25.874 --> 03:01:28.244
MONEY SO THAT'S MY QUESTION

03:01:28.310 --> 03:01:31.347
THERE ON THE ATP ON THE-

03:01:31.413 --> 03:01:32.982
TARGETED TRAINING FOR EMERGENCY

03:01:33.048 --> 03:01:36.018
MEDICAL TECHNICIANS I READ THE

03:01:36.085 --> 03:01:39.088
MODEL THAT WAS BEING USED AND

03:01:39.154 --> 03:01:40.723
WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT THE

03:01:40.789 --> 03:01:42.558
MODEL HAS THERE'S A TRAINING

03:01:42.625 --> 03:01:44.760
STIPEND OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS A

03:01:44.827 --> 03:01:47.863
MONTH- SO THAT PARTICIPANTS CAN

03:01:47.930 --> 03:01:51.834
FOCUS ON TRAINING. WITHOUT PART

03:01:51.900 --> 03:01:52.468
TIME OR FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT. I

03:01:52.534 --> 03:01:53.969
KNOW THAT THAT'S EXACTLY THE

03:01:54.036 --> 03:01:56.472
KIND OF MODEL WE WANT TO USE

03:01:56.538 --> 03:01:58.474
BECAUSE A THOUSAND DOLLARS A

03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:00.142
MONTH IS NOT GOING TO PAY THE

03:02:00.209 --> 03:02:01.343
BILLS. EVERY EXPECTED TO DO THE

03:02:01.410 --> 03:02:04.113

03:02:04.179 --> 03:02:05.614
WORK SO JUST TO COMMENT ON THAT

03:02:05.681 --> 03:02:07.583

OBVIOUSLY. SIMPLY REGIONALLY BIG

03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:27.002
SOME OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

THE TRAINING CAN BE DONE EITHER

03:02:28.537 --> 03:02:31.807
