GOOD MORNING- THE CHAIRMAN AND HERE AND PLEASE TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU A CA FIVE THE CALIFORNIA ACT ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. THIS MEASURE WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO TAKE MEANINGFUL STEPS TO MINIMIZE INEQUALITY AND PROMOTE ECONOMIC FAIRNESS FOR ALL. AC A FIVE SIX TO PREVENT CONTINUE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR BY ALLOWING GENDER RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY TO BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE MANY FACTORS IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT PUBLIC CONTRACTING AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION TOOL NINE WHICH INTO THE USE OF RACE AND GENDER CONSCIOUS DECISION MAKING IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SECTOR. THIS CHANGE WOULD CALIFORNIA'S STEP BACK FROM THE NATION BEING ONLY ONE OF EIGHT STATES THAT HAVE THIS BAN ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND SERVES AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO LOCAL AND STATE POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY WOMEN. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIFTEEN STUDY WOMEN OWNED AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES CONSERVATIVELY LOSE OVER ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THE TO THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION TOOL NINE. CALIFORNIA WHAT FROM BEING ONE OF THE TOP PERFORMING STATES IN THE COUNTRY. IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES WITH OUR CALTRANS DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE CONTRACTING. TO ONE OF THE TWO WORST PERFORMING STATES RELATIVE TO ITS DIVERSITY PUTTING IT IN THE COMPANY OF STATES WITH MUCH LESS THE BURKE BE SUCH AS NEBRASKA AND VERMONT. EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION REMAINS PERSISTENT ACCORDING TO RECENT RESEARCH 27% OF ASIAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND 56% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. HAVE EXPERIENCED DISCRIMINATION WHEN APPLYING JOBS. WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ALSO WITHSTAND HIGH LEVELS OF DISCRIMINATION WHEN SEEKING PROMOTION OR WILL PAY. CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT DATA REVEALS THAT WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR CONTINUE TO BE UNDER REPRESENTED AND UNDER VALUE ESPECIALLY IN HIGH LEVEL EXECUTIVE POSITIONS THAT COME WITH INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY. POLICY IMPLEMENTATION CONTROL AND COMPENSATION. IN ADDITION A SEVERAL RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT THE MOST READ RELATIVE REPRESENTATIVE AND REFLECTIVE OUR CIVIL RIGHTS SERVANTS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE THE MORE RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT TENDS TO BE. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT MINORITY POLICE OFFICERS WERE LESS LIKELY THAN WHITE OFFCERS TO CHARACTERIZE MINORITY CITIZENS AS HOSTILE WHEN DIFFERENT TO LAW AND ORDER. BLACK SO SHE WORKERS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN THEIR WIVES COWORKERS TO PROCEED BLACK CLIENTS FAVORABLY. IT IS ALSO WIDELY RECOGNIZED THE TEACHER DIVERSITY CAN HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND STUDENT SUCCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS ESPECIALLY STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF OUR STUDENT BODY. BUT WE REMAIN AT A CRISIS POINT WITH OUR FAILURE TO RECRUIT. IT TWO DOLLAR. ESPECIALLY WOMEN CRITICAL LIKE MASS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE OF THE BEER IS A PROP TWO OH NINE. CURRENTLY PROP TWO NINE STANDS IN THE WAY OF CALIFORNIA EVEN GIVEN PUBLIC DOLLARS TO PROGRAMS LIKE SCIENCE CAMP FOR GIRLS. SUCH PROGRAMS WOULD HAVE WOULD HAVE DROPPED THE FOCUS ON GIRLS OR RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIVATE DONATIONS. TRUCKS WILL BE AREAS SUCH AS PROP TWO OH NINE HAVE LEFT WOMEN IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH A RELENTLESS WEALTH GAP. MORE VULNERABLE TO THE VIRUS AT HIGHER RISK OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND WITH FEWER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. CALIFORNIA DESERVES MORE THAN JUST RECOVERY FROM COLD AT NINETEEN WE MUST COMMIT TO WORKING TOWARD A STRONGER MORE EQUITABLE CALIFORNIA WONDERFUL FAMILY. THE COVERT NINETEEN HAS DONE TO WHEN PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE STATE. TO RESPOND WE NEED INTENTIONAL AND FOR PER AND PROPORTIONALLY TARGETED REMEDIES TO HELP THESE COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THE PROP TWO OH NINE LARGELY FOR BE IT. BUT NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS POP TOOL NINE HAS BLINDED OUR LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS TO THE BEER IS FACED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. IT HAS HURT AND NOT CALIFORNIA'S BY PROHIBITING TIME TESTED EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS LIKE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THE BULLS TO EDUCATION AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. DATA SUGGEST THAT WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY LIVING IN A COLOR BLIND SOCIETY. INSTEAD THE DATA SUGGEST THAT WE DEEPLY EQUAL SOCIETY WITH THE TOOLS TO COMPETE IN SOCIETY UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED INDUSTRY WITHIN A MATTER THAT PERPETUATES INEQUALITY BETWEEN RACES AND GENDERS AT ALL LEVELS OF CLASS AND SCIETY. THE COLLECTIVE ACTIONS WE HAVE SEEN AROUND THE REPRESENTS AND CALL SISTER CHANGE. WHEN YOU BOOK IT SHOULD BE THE- TO REVISIT AND EXPRESSED VIEWS. WOMEN FOR JIM BIAS DESPAIR.

BEFORE AND POSITION. I HAVEN'T. WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE VIEW PLEASE TO OUR COMMITTEE ARE YOU CALL OUR COMMITTEE AND LEAVE YOUR TESTIMONY FOR THAT AND- THANK YOU MODERATOR FOR YOUR GOOD WORK TODAY AS WELL WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH IN. BACK TO THE TO A ANY MEMBERSHIP ANY OR COMMENTS. FISH SENATOR CENTER PAN. THANK YOU I MISS CHAIR AND- YEAH APPRECIATE THE- VARIOUS COMMENTS AND- TO JUST PATIENTS PEOPLE ON THIS. IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WHICH WILL GO TO THE VOTERS SO. WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY IS- BASICALLY DECIDING WHETHER TO PUT BEFORE THE VOTERS. AND ALLOW THE VOTERS AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THIS DECISION. HOWEVER I DO WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF- RAISING THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE VOTERS. AND AT YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA SAY AS A MEMBER OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER TO BE THAT ACTUALLY ABOUT POLLING HAS SHOWN THAT THE MAJORITY OF ATI. SUPPORT ACA FIVE AND PLACE IT BEFORE THE VOTERS. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR- SECOND OF ALL- I DO HEAR AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A SEGMENT OF THE API COMMUNITY. EARLIER CHINESE AMERICANS WHO HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THIS AND I THINK IT IT- YOU KNOW I WILL TELL YOU I'M A FATHER I HAVE. CHILDREN I REMEMBER FLYING COLLAGEN HEARING RUMORS ABOUT QUOTAS AND- CERTAINLY- DISCRIMINATION AGAINST APPLICANTS TO OUR- CHINESE AMERICAN. ASIAN SOME OF THAT PERHAPS GROUNDED IN. HERE THEIR MEDIUM DUTY BEEN SOME TRUTH TO THAT. BUT IT WASN'T BECAUSE BLACK OR BROWN APPLICANTS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY MY SPOT THE FACT I WOULD SAY THAT REALISTICALLY IS GOING TO BE THE ALUM FRIENDS OR THE WHO HAD THE WHERE WITH ALL TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN SUPPORT. THAT APPS WITH. RELIEVED CAN AGAINST NOT BASED ON OUR MERITS BUT BASED ON THEIR PRIVILEGE AND WELL. AND SO CERTAINLY I HERE'S THE FEAR THAT. SOME OF THE- AT WHO ARE AND OPPOSITION- THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S CHANCES OF GETTING A SO CALLED TOP SLOTS ARE TOP COLLEGE AND BUT I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY EXAMINE WHAT THE ISSUE IS WHEN IT COMES. THE THING THAT I ALSO WANT TO MENTION IS. I'M CERTAINLY I THINK MANY OF US WANT TO EMBRACE THIS IDEA OF A MERITOCRACY. BUT HOW DO YOU HAVE A MERITOCRACY WHEN WE HAVE STRUCTURAL RACISM. AND I WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE API COMMUNITY. BECAUSE OF ALL I THINK MANY OF US- EXPERIENCE NO MATTER HOW MANY GENERATIONS OUR FAMILY HAVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THE REFORM HERE OVER IMMIGRANTS YEAR. OF IN NINETEEN. AT THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN OR PERHAPS THE SLANT OF ARISE OR WHATEVER OTHER FEATURE. LOOK MORE DEEPLY. AND THEY BLAMED US AND WE WERE CALLED FOREIGNERS AND PEOPLE WHO SPREAD DISEASES WHEN. WAS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE TAKING ACTUALLY MANY. TO HELP SPREAD THE DISEASE. AND I HOPE THAT'S A REMINDER THAT UNFORTUNATELY AS MUCH AS WE MAY DESIRE. THE SITUATION THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE. THE SECOND THING I'D ALSO WANT TO MENTION IS ACTUALLY I CHAIR THE- SELECT COMMITTEE ON EIGHTY I'VE ERRORS. AND WHEN WE HAD A HEARING LOOKING AT ESSENTIALLY THE GLASS CEILING FOR API. SO LET ME JUST GIVE ONE EXAMPLE I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE ON THE SHARE. I'M A PHYSICIAN ALL RIGHT AND CERTAINLY. BUT PLAN A POLITE TO MEDICAL SCHOOL WE CAN LOOK AROUND AND SOME ASIANS I WANNA SAY ONLY SOME PACIFIC ISLANDERS DO NOT- MAY BE OF THE SOUTHEAST ASIANS ARE UNDER REPRESENTS DIDN'T IN MEDICINE. MY IS SO IS A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS FROM. WE ARE YOU KNOW OVER READ. IN THIS PART PORTION THE ELATION. OUR. WELL DOING PRETTY WELL THEY'RE GREAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PARCHMENT TEARS. NOT SO WELL WHEN YOU LOOK AT DEAN'S TO THINK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOME MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE API MEDICAL SCHOOL DEAN. SO WHAT HAPPENED. LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT CHAIRS WHAT HAPPENED THERE AND SO I GUESS I WOULD RAISE THE ISSUE OF. IS IT BECAUSE- YOUR WE ALSO UNQUALIFIED FOR PROMOTION TO SERVE IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT POSITIONS TO SERVE AS EXECUTIVES TO SERVE ON CORPORATE BOARDS THIS IS ALL NOT ONLY ABOUT MEDICINE THIS IS ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS. WERE NOT WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW REYES PLAYS INTO. BUT AS EMISSIONS TO SCHOOLS ARE HIGHER EDUCATION TO OUR CONTRACTS THAT WITH THE GOVERNMENT. TO HIRING. HOW CAN WE HELP TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW REYES PLAYS INTO THE FACT THAT. MANY API ALSO ARE NOT GETTING OUR FAIR CHANCE. TO SERVE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AS WELL WHETHER IT'S IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN OUR PROFESSIONS IN OTHER ARENAS YEAH SO I THINK WE REALLY WANT TO BE HONEST ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION. CAN I AND- RACE DOESN'T MATTER AND THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT LOOK AT IS THIS WAY AND SO I THINK I HOPE THAT I CERTAINLY HERE THE OPPOSITION. I CERTAINLY SYMPATHIZE THEIR FEARS. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE PROGRAM AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW REYES PLAYS INTO THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROVIDE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY I'M WE NEED TO PASS A CA FIRES SO CERTAINLY I ALWAYS THE VOTING IN SUPPORT AND- THE VOTE. CAN HAVE THEIR OP TO WEIGH IN ON THIS BUT I ALSO ASK THAT. THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION TO REALLY THINK ABOUT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS. CERTAINLY NOT TO USE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS EVEN FOR OWN COMMUNITY AND HOW IMPORTANT THE CONVERSATION AROUND A SEAT A FIVE WILL BE FOR EVEN. THEIR OWN FAMILY AND THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND THE THAT IS THEY'LL HAVE AND CERTAINLY AGAIN IS WHAT REEMPHASIZED THE API COMMUNITY AT LARGE DOES SUPPORT AC FIVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IF YOU DOCTOR AND SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER A CHAIR AND AS PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL I WOULD LIKE MOVE THE BILL. AND I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I LISTENED TO- THE DEBATE TODAY AND ONE MEMBER THE PUBLIC CHALLENGED US TO LISTEN TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND I AM. ALL MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EMAILS TO MY PUBLIC ACCOUNTS. CONSTITUENTS AND A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM WEREN'T EVEN RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I AM LISTENING TO MY CONSTITUENTS. AND THOSE ARE KAISER PERMANENTE A ADVANCEMENT PROJECT ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR TO BLACK STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA UNITED THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN. ARE CONSTITUTIONAL OFF COMMISSIONPART A LARA AN CONTROLLER BETTY. I'M LISTENING TO MY MAYOR AIR GUARD THREE LAUSD SCHOOL DISTRICT ONCE FEET ONE. CARE C. THE KOREAN RESOURCE CENTER LARA. THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY TO THE SIERRA CLUB THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION THE UFC RACE IN EQUITY CENTER IN THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I AM LISTENING TO MY CONSTITUENTS. AND IT STRIKES ME. ANY ONE WOULD CHOOSE TO OPPOSE A POLICY THAT AIMS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ROLE THAT DOT PLAYS IN ONE BILL. TO ACCESS HIGHER EDUCATION IN THEIR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS BEYOND ME. WHAT I DO HERE AND WHAT I FIND QUITE PAINFUL. IS A BLATANT DISREGARD FOR THE HISTORY OF LIFE EXPERIENCE. FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE OTHER THAN ONE'S OWN. THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN AND OF ITSELF COULD BE CONSIDERED BY US. I'D LIKE TO COMPLIMENT THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR WRITING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL INCLUDING THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO READ IT I'M SURE CAN BE FOUND ON THE SENATE LABOR COMMITTEES WEBSITE. WHAT'S IMPORTANT ON PAGE TWO OF THIS ANALYSIS IS IT. PROP TWO OH NINE PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN A HISTORICAL CONTEXT IT REMINDS US OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN OUR STATE DURING THAT TIME. BEN ALTHEA NOW STATES ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS INITIATIVE WHICH BECAME PROP TWO OH NINE WAS AN ANTHROPOLOGIST AT THE CAL STATE SYSTEM GLAND CONSTRUED. WHO N A BOOK THE FIFTY TWO OH NINE THE BOOK ENTITLED THE COLOR BLIND CALIFORNIA'S BATTLE TO END AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HE DESCRIBED HIS JOB TO UPHOLD BUT ACTION. BORN FOR HE DID. HURT WORTH DIVERSE THE AND MORE CULTURALISM. AND HE SAID I QUOTE PERMISSION TO READ MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. AS AN ANTHROPOLOGIST I KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT DIVERSITY. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO DEAL WITH IT AND THE MOST REALISTIC WAY POSSIBLE. HE ALSO DESCRIBE MULTI CULTURALISM IS QUOTE. IF WITH CONFIRMED FULL AMERICA WAS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT A COMMON GROUND BETWEEN ALL AMERICANS. WE'RE AMERICA COULD FIND QUESTIONS COMMON GROUND IS UNCLEAR BUT APPARENTLY IT WAS NOT FOUND IN EITHER MULTI CULTURALISM OR ARE CITY. RATHER NOTING THE TECH FOR THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS INITIATIVE THE COMMON GROUND IS IN THE DENIAL OF DIFFERENCES A COLOR BLIND AND GENDER BLIND SOCIETY. I WOULD ARGUE THAT MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS I'VE RECEIVED IN OPPOSITION TO A CA FIVE ON OUR. FULL OF MIS INFORMATION AND TRAGICALLY. ANTI THE THEIR VITRIOLIC IN TERMS OF THEIR COMMENTS ABOUT. PEOPLE OF COLOR QUITE FRANKLY. IN ON WHATEVER YOUR PERCEPTION IS OF WHAT A COLOR BLIND SOCIETY EVEN IS. THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY LIVING IN ONE. INSTEAD THE DATA SUGGEST THAT WE LIVE IN A DEEPLY ON EQUAL SOCIETY WITH THE TOOLS TO COMPLETE COMPETE IN SOCIETY ARE ON EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND DISTRIBUTED IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS YOU AIDS WE QUALITY BETWEEN RACES AND GENDER AT ALL LEVELS OF CLASS IN SOCIETY. YOU HEARD A NUMBER OF WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ROLE AS MOTHER. I TO LIMóN MY- AND THEY TALKED ABOUT NOT WANTING TO HAVE TO TELL THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY WERE BEING JUDGED BY THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN IN TEN YEARS. I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT MY SON UNDERSTAND THAT HE'S JUDGED BY THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN EVERY SINGLE DAY OF HIS. YOU KNOW PERSONALLY THIS NOTION OF A COLOR BLIND SOCIETY I FIND OFFENSIVE. BECAUSE IT DID NOT ICE WHO I AM MY CALL BY RICH CULTURAL HERITAGE THE HERITAGE AND BACKGROUND BUT I'M QUITE PROUD OF. FOOD COLOR BLIND. IT'S ABOUT RISK. IN DIFFERENT FIFTH. THEY ALLEGING THAT ME AND YOU KNOW WHO ARE AM AS A WOMAN AMERICA. AND SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS AGAIN IT GIVES ME GREAT PRIDE TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY. IN TWENTY TWENTY. NOT IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WERE WE HAD A AMBITIOUS THE GOVERNOR WHO WAS TRYING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT THAT WAS GOING TO RUN ON THE BACKS OF FEAR THAT HE HAD PREPARED THE WAY. OF IMMIGRANTS AND THESE OF COLOR. NO NINETY NINE SIX COMING OFF OF THE PASSAGE OF PROP ONE EIGHTY SEVEN AGAIN AT INITIATIVE- THE FRAME DIDN'T CAST IN THIS NOTION OF FEAR OF PEOPLE WERE DIFFERENT FROM YOU. BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THE ACA FIVE GETS ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL AWAKENING. ABOUT THE ROLE BIAS IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT HAS PLAYED ON OUR WORLD IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR STATE. AND SO AGAIN IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO CO AUTHOR AND TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MISTER CHAIR I WILL READ A THREE EIGHT FIVE TODAY THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR. THANK YOU MISTER POCH CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I ALSO APPRECIATED THE ROBUST DISCUSSION. ARE ALSO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN SUPPORT AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF. PROP TWO OH NINE WAS ON THE BALLOT. IT WAS A DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA AND INDEED A DIFFERENT GENERATION. MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE OUR CONSIDERING THIS A POLICY ARE WEREN'T EVEN BORN. WHEN THEY PASSED IT EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX IF WE WERE TO PUT THIS ON THE BALLOT AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE COME TO REALIZE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH. THAT BY BRINGING TOGETHER. AMERICANS AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE AMERICANS AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE HERE AND EXPERIENCE THE GREAT. PROMISE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES THEY HAVE BUILT THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE. THEY HAVE BUILT THE RICH CULTURAL TRADITIONS THE STATE NATION. AND THE NOTION THAT WE BELIEVE TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THAT BY DENYING OUR DIFFERENCES WE WOULD BE ELEVATING EVERYBODY. HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE COMPLETELY. THE OPPOSITE. WHETHER IT'S RACE OR GENDER. YOU KNOW I HAVE DONE IN THE COURSE OF MY LEGISLATIVE CAREER A NUMBER OF BILLS TO GIVE WOMEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE EQUALLY IN OUR SOCIETY. WE ARE STILL IN THAT BATTLE. WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED ACHIEVED THAT LEVEL OF EQUALITY. BECAUSE WE ARE A BIASED WORLD WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE BASED UPON THEIR RACE THEIR CREED% THEIR NATIONAL ORIGIN THEIR GENDER WHICH CASH HISTORICALLY KEPT THEM DOWN. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS FOR US TO REEVALUATE WHO WE ARE AS A STATE WHAT WE WANT TO BE AS A STATE AND WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. AND SO YOU SEE THIS IS. TO NAY. THIS ICAC FIVE AS IN A POP. NOT TO PRO AN ADVANTAGE BUT TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EQUALLY AND I THINK IT IS INCOME ON US THE SONG BALLOT SO THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SIDE. THIS SO. UP REYES ENGENDERED BY PAULA HAS EFFECTIVE AND WHETHER IT'S CAN TO BE PURSUED BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THIS WORLD LOOKS LKE TODAY OUR CALIFORNIA LOOKS LIKE TODAY CLEARLY THIS ISSUE DESERVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE TO GET. I TRULY. NOT THAT ARE DUE. ARE BASED. AND NOT PUSH UNDER THE RUG. AND SO WITH THAT I WANT TO JOIN AND THANK THE AUTHOR AND- APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS WE REALLY NEED TO BE MOTIVATED BY FAT AND NOT FEAR AND THAT IS MY HOPE IS THIS MEASURE- DOES HOPEFULLY PROCEED. ON THE BALLOT THE BILL OF ONE YEAR HAVE THE- TO MAKE THAT DECISION THANK YOU THANK YOU JACKSON. OF SENIOR ELSE IN THE SHE JUST ASSEMBLY MEMBER BACK TO WORK WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES FIRST OF ALL LET ME THANK ALL OF YOU FOR PATIENCE MISTY TO FOR YOU TOM PATIENTS WELL THE WE SAID THEM SUCH A LONG SAID OF HEARING AND COMMON THAT WOULD BE. OWN I THINK ALL OF WHO DO TESTIFY I THINK IS AND TO PEOPLE BEEN UP TO SOME. WITH IT IN A BILL OR POST WHAT LEARN A LOT WHAT WE HE AND WHAT THE FEARS ARE WITH THE CA. ARE AS LEAD TO SINCE WHILE WELCOME OPPOSITE. SO LET'S BUILT. IN ETHNIC STUDIES FOR SO LONG- I WOULD NEVER INTRODUCE ANY BILL THAT WOULD PROMOTE DISCRIMINATION AND HER AND HARM TO ANY PARTICULAR GROUP. ACTUALLY RESPECT DIVERSITY THAT IS CALIFORNIA AND IT IS CALIFORNIA'S STRENGTH. AT AND YOU HAVE A CALIFORNIA TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE. AND WHO COME WHO EXPECT TO BE EXPECTED. WE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE CAN NEVER A PROBLEM THAT WE REFUSE TO SEE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE IN THE STREET TODAY A PROBLEM THAT HAS EXISTED INFESTED SO LONG. AND WE HAVE TURNED A BLIND EYE TO IT BELIEVING THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A WONDERFUL STATE WITH WONDERFUL BEACHES AND ONE OTHER. BUT SOMEHOW THAT WITH ALL OF THE ILLS OF CALIFORNIA. DOES NOT AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND THERE'S A- AND A EVEN THOUGH MY NAME IS IN THIS. IS THE FIRST. I WILL LET BECAUSE WAS THAT'S- TO BE I WAS CLOSE ME LAST NAME. I DON'T KNOW WHO TWISTED ALL ROUND BUT ANYWAY. MY NAME IN THE BE THE FIRST NAME ON THE BILL THIS BILL IS A COALITION OF PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE. OF THIS QUOTATION OF ALL THE- CARCASSES THE MEN'S CAUCUS. THE APS CAUGHT THE JEWISH POCKET. IN A I I'M TRYING TO BE A BLACK EIGHT L. G. B. CALL. ALL OF THE END OF WHO KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE INCLUDED. TO BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I'M ALWAYS PLEASED WITH SO MANY PEOPLE QUOTE MARTIN LUTHER KING NO MATTER WHERE YEARS HIS NAME IS ALWAYS INVOLVED IN HIS WORDS ALWAYS IMPORTANT. BUT THEY HAVE TO REALIZE THE TRUE KING THE FULL KING THAT IS THAT. WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT I DON'T WANT TO BE JUDGED BY THE CONTENT THE COLOR OF MY SKIN BUT THE CONTENT OF MY CHARACTER. THAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH THAT WAS IT THREE. THAT WAS NOT READ. THAT WAS DURING WHAT. THE RACE.

ED YOU CAN GET THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I WILL NOT BE ASKING TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR DESPITE THE FACT THAT I. WE WISH I COULD ADD MY NAME. TO THIS MEASURE. SO TO SAY THAT I HOPE YOU WELCOME IS A SPIRITUAL CO AUTHOR. ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. A LARGE PART OF THE REASON I WISH TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHORS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A C. FIVE. HELPS US RISE TO THE- TO THE MATCH OUR COURAGE MOMENT IN HISTORY. I REMEMBER WATCHING NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. AND I REMEMBER I JOIN THE CALIFORNIA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD A YEAR LATER. AND MOST OF THE TRADING WAS REVOLVED AROUND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN STREET VIOLENCE THAT WE HAD TO LOOK AT AND PREPARE FOR KNOWING THAT IT MAY COME. I REMEMBER HOW CHIEF PARKER THE MAN WHO COINED THE TERM THIN BLUE LINE. ACTIVELY MAKE CHOICES THAT INFLAME THE SITUATION. NOW REMEMBER HOW AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ELECTED RONALD REAGAN. WHO DID NOT MAKE FISH OF JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION THE CORNERSTONE OF CALIFORNIA POLICY. I ALSO REMEMBER THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO RIGHT. REMEMBER MY RATE SHOULD HOW RODNEY KING. WAS VICIOUSLY BEATEN. BY OUT OF CONTROL POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE LATER FOUND NOT GUILTY. I REMEMBER HOW DARRYL GATES PARADED HIS RACISM AND MISMANAGEMENT FOR ALL TO SEE. AND I REMEMBER MY INTENT SAID THIS WHEN THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SUCCUMB TO. PETE WILSON'S ACTIONS IN PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY SEVEN IN NINETY FOUR IT IS MENTIONED PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE IN. NINETEEN NINETY SIX. TODAY CALIFORNIA IS IT A SIMILAR CROSSROADS. JUST AS NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND NINETEEN NINETY TWO PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE RIGHTFULLY ANGRY AT A LONG HISTORY OF INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM AND POLICIES THAT SAY YOUR LIFE DON'T MATTER. JUST LIKE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE CHANCE TO REJECT RACISM. REJECTED INSTITUTIONALIZED OPPRESSION AND SAY. BLACK LIVES MATTER. BROWN LIVES MATTER THE LIVES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR MATTER. TWENTY TWENTY NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENT. THANK YOU FOR REMINDING US OF THAT SENATOR MITCHELL WE NEED TO CHECK IMPLICIT BIAS IN INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM IN ALL AREAS OF OUR LIVES. WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE FAIL TO DO IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THAT. I BELIEVE THAT A CA FIVE IS A SMALL PART CRUCIAL STEP. TOWARDS HEALING AND ADDRESSING THE DUBIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR STATES LEGACY. I BELIEVE IT SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO MEET THIS. FREE ONE CALIFORNIA YIELDED TO RACISM AND WHERE WE FAIL TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT. AND SHOULD THE VOTERS APPROVE AC FIVE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. CONFRONTING OUR STATE'S LEGACY OF RACISM AND OPPRESSION AND BEGINNING THE DIFFICULT PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND CHANGE YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU ALL KIND OF PERSON ICE THESE ISSUES AS THEY COME BEFORE. I LOOK AT MYSELF AFTER THE EVENTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIDN'T AND WITH ITS NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE NINETEEN NINETY TWO OR TO SEEING WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT. IT UNTIL THE- I FIND THAT I AM TRULY GUILTY BECAUSE I THOUGHT EACH ONE OF THESE EVENTS. THAT LIFE WOULD CHANGE AFTER THAT IT WAS AN ANOMALY IT WAS A BAD COP HERE OR BAD OFFICER OR- THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WERE DIFFERENT BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT REALLY WAS. THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THESE ACTIONS AND WE'D SEE CHANGE. HI VANTAGE POINT. I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT. FORTUNATELY I GREW UP IN SAN FRANCISCO MY PARENTS WERE THE BEST THINGS THEY EVER GAVE ME WAS THAT CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT I EMBRACED IT ENJOYED AND FELT THAT THAT'S HOW IT WAS EVERYWHERE. IT WAS AND OFTEN THOUGHT WHEN I WAS- PULLED OVER BY A POLICE OFFICER IN DRIVING. THE COUPLE THINGS GO THROUGH MY MIND FIRST ONE IS. HOW MY GONNA TALK MY WAY OUT OF THIS. SECOND AM I GONNA GO TO TRAFFIC SCHOOL OR AM I GOING TO PAY THE TAKE. THE AREA I WOULD HAVE TO. IN THE REAL WORLD A REAL PEOPLE FULL OF COLOR. SO I COULD FOR ME I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT WENT THROUGH ANYONE'S MIND. SO I AM GUILTY. THE. LITTLE DID I KNOW. MAYBE LITTLE IS ALL I WANTED TO KNOW. TO MY ASSUMPTIONS HAVE BEEN WRONG NOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE. AND WE MUST TREE. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH I'M REMINDED BY JOHN F. KENNEDY'S ONCE QUOTED WHEN SAID.
