AS A PHYSICIAN THE ISSUES WITH HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. SPECIFICALLY AS A LATINO PHYSICIAN FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY ETHNIC DIVERSITY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISPARITIES IN THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE SHOULD BE FRONT AND CENTER OF ALL OF OUR ATTENTION AS WE EMBARK ON THE NEXT MAJOR EXPANSION TO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THROUGH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WE ALL KNOW IT IT BEARS REPEATING THAT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IS NOT THE SAME THING AS HEALTHCARE ACCESS. THAT HAVING MEDIC CAL OR COVERED CALIFORNIA COVERAGE CARD IN YOUR WALLET IS MEANINGLESS IF THERE IS NO AVAILABLE DOCTOR OR OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL TO SEE. AS A RESULT OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA ARGUABLY NO ONE IN THE STATE HAS SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE LIMITED MOST SEVERELY FOR LOW INCOME AND RURAL CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS IS WHERE WE MUST FOCUS OUR ATTENTION AND RESOURCES IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THIS BASIC HUMAN RIGHT AND ENSURE THE GREATEST OVERALL PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WILL NOW ASK MY COLLEAGUE AND CHAIR OF SOME FOR ANY INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS AND TO INTRODUCE THE FIRST. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA- AND THANK YOU FOR HELPING FACILITATE THIS JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING BETWEEN OUR TWO BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES I KNOW THAT INTO FOUR WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND PROBABLY AND SOMEONE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME AND IT'S NOW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO JOIN TOGETHER AND NOT HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS AND SILO. AS NOTED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT- INVESTMENT OF ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION OVER THREE YEARS TO EXPAND THE CARE- ECONOMY WORKFORCE WHILE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR HAS EXAMINED SOME ELEMENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL DURING ITS LABOR HEARING ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME BOTH COMMITTEES WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO HEAR ALL THE COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL IN ITS ENTIRE CONTEXT WHICH IS IMPORTANT. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO CREATE A CULTURALLY COMPETENT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKFORCE WHOSE TRAINING IS ROOTED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO OUTLINE ITS SPECIFIC PLAN TO EXPAND SUCH A WORK FORCE BUT THIS BUT THIS HEARING IS ALSO ABOUT MAKING SURE CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG TERM PLAN TO SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASE FRONTLINE WORKER WAGES ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES AND IMPROVE. POPULATION HEALTH OUTCOMES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SPREADS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS SEVERAL STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION AS WE HEAR THESE VARIOUS PROPOSALS I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL HIGHLIGHT HOW THE OVERALL EFFORT FITS TOGETHER AND HOW THIS INITIATIVE WILL REMAIN COORDINATED TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NEEDS ULTIMATELY WE WANT A SYSTEM THAT IS. SEAMLESS COOPERATIVE AND TALKS TO EACH OTHER WHICH IS IMPORTANT SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE ISSUE ONE OUR FIRST PANEL THE GOVERNOR'S HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE BUDGET PROPOSAL OVERVIEW- LET'S GET STARTED INTERNS WILL INCLUDE DOLLS- DARCY THEN GADO ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

I'M SUPER HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY MY NAME IS DARCY DELGADO IN THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I WANT TO START JUST BY THINKING. BOTH OF THESE SUBCOMMITTEES AND IN PARTICULAR THINKING THE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF THE AGENDA THAT THEY'VE PROPOSED AFTER TODAY'S DISCUSSION. IS VERY THOROUGH AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THIS INITIATIVE IN REALLY THE THOROUGHNESS OF THE AGENDA SPEAKS TO THE URGENCY AND IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND OF COURSE I THINK YOU TOO MUCH TO THE DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND MOUNTAINS YOUR CARDIO FOR YOUR EFFORTS AND WORK IN THIS AREA AND CAN'T GROW ENOUGH YOUR OPENING STATEMENTS I HOPE THAT BY THE END OF THE DAY YOU'LL SEE HOW THE LINES THIS INITIATIVE IS. WITH THE THEMES AND VALUES THAT BOTH COULD BE ARTICULATED. IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS. SO MY ROLE TODAY- I HAVE THREE. IN WITH YOU ALL TODAY THE FIRST TO OVER THE WAY FORCE ALL INITIATIVE. THE SECOND PIECE ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES DOESN'T HAVE BEINGS THAT IS WHY THIS ISSUE IS SO URGENT RIGHT NOW. AND THEN I WILL SPEAK TO THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS THAT. CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HAS TAKEN WITH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. AFTER I FINISH THOSE THREE ITEMS I'LL HAND IT OVER TO LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IS DEPUTY DIRECTOR ABBY ST. WHO WILL BE GIVING A LITTLE BIT MORE BACKGROUND FROM LABOR PERSPECTIVE. SUCH AS- I WORKFORCE FRAWLEY. IS A LARGE PACKAGE AT ELEVEN LINE ITEMS TOTALING ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS I AM JUST GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THIS INITIATIVE. AND DON'T WANT TO STEAL THE THUNDER ASK FOR HER ARE EACH TIED DIRECTOR LIZ THAT LANDSBERG. DEPUTY DIRECTOR HOBBIES NAY WHO WILL BE DEEP DIVING INTO A LOT OF THOSE ELEVEN DIFFERENT LINE ITEMS BUT I CAN'T SAY. THAT THE PACKAGE IN TOTAL RELEASED I STRIDES TO ADDRESS THE URGENT NEEDS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN BOTH THE HEALTH WORK HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IN HUMAN SERVICES WORKFORCE. I KNOW THAT- BUT MANY FOLKS HAVE SENIOR THROUGHOUT THE KOBE PANDEMIC. THAT WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT SHORTAGES IN NURSING AND SHORTAGES AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND YES COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THAT SHORTAGE EXISTS BUT WE'RE ALSO SEEING IT. QUITE STRONGLY IN HUMAN. SERVICES WORKFORCE SO. EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT. THE DIFFERENT LINE ITEM IN THE- TODAY INCLUDING- INITIATIVES THAT ARE TARGETING SOCIAL WORKERS. NURSING OR NURSING AS A WHOLE INCLUDING CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT RN'S- PSYCHIATRY AND REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER. THANK YOU WE HAVE MANY ANALYSTS ON THE CALL TODAY AND OTHERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE pGOAL OF THIS WORKFORCE INITIATIVE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WORK FORCE FOR ALL INITIATIVE AND I'M SPEAKING TO BE BROUGHT INTO. A LEVIN LINE ITEMS TOTAL. THE PRIME GOAL IS TO RECRUIT. TRAIN HIGHER AND ADVANCED AN ETHNICALLYAND CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE WE NEED TO IMPROVE DIVERSITY WE NEED TO IMPROVE COMPENSATION. AND WITH THE HOPES THAT BY IMPROVING THIS WORKFORCE WILL ALSO SEE SOME SECONDARY HEALTH EQUITY OUTCOMES. SO MY BOSS- AT DR MARK GALLI WHO IS THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. HAS TOLD ME SPECIFICALLY WORKING ON THIS- INITIATIVE THAT NOT A DAY GOES BY WHERE SOMEONE ISN'T COMING TO HIM ABOUT WORKFORCE ISSUES WHETHER HE'S ADDED A CLINIC. ADDED ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY OR NURSING FACILITY HOMELESS SHELTER TALKING TO COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MAY BE VISITING- ONE OF OUR STATE HOSPITALS OR WITHIN THE CORRECTIONAL SETTING NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT SOMEONE IS NOT COMING TO HIM AND PLEADING. FOR ASSISTANCE WITHIN THE WORK FORCE FIELD AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH OUR WORKFORCE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STARTED BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY ONLY EXACERBATED THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE SEEING- BUT BEING AT. PIECE THAT I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON TODAY AND AGAIN HOPEFULLY YOU WILL GET A SENSE OF AS WE TALK TO ALL OF THE LINE ITEM. IS THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY. REPRESENTATION MATTERS AND A WORKFORCE NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE CALIFORNIANS BUT IT SERVES IN NEEDS TO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AS THE CALIFORNIANS THAT SEARCH IN OFTENTIMES NEEDS TO HAVE THE SAME LIFE EXPERIENCE AND SO WHEN WE SPEAK TODAY- IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. VERY EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT THE INITIATIVES THAT REALLY FOCUSED ON- BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES TO HELP LIFT UP THE WORK FORCE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE AGAIN REPRESENTATION. MATTERS AND- AB HELPED WORKERS BIRDS THERE ARE A BILL TO REACH PARTS- THE LACK COMMUNITY YOU KNOW THE I'M WHAT USED- REPRESENT MATTER. IN AT TWENTY HELP OR RIGHT THAT OR PRO WE THAT TYPE X. IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH. AND SO THAT REALLY IS ONE OF THE CORE VALUES OF THE WORK FORCE FOR ALL INITIATIVE DIVERSITY AND REPRESENTATION. AND AS WE TALKED TODAY AND AS I GO THROUGH THE OVERVIEW HOPEFULLY YOU WILL SEE THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF NEED. JUSTIFIES THE MAGNITUDE OF FUNDING THE URGENCY. YEAH I CAN'T STATE ENOUGH HOW URGENT THIS ISSUE IS. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF A BRIEF OVERVIEW BUT I. REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE JOINT EFFORT AND COLLABORATION THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING I LOVE WHEN CHAIR CARDIO SAID EARLY ON THAT. I IN HER OPENING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE YOU KNOW BRINGING TOGETHER THESE TWO SUB COMMITTEES AND IN SOME WAYS THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST THREE OR FOUR MONTHS ON THIS INITIATIVE. IS THAT IN THAT IT IS VERY UNIQUE IN THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WE AT CAL HHS HAVE BEEN WORKING SIDE BY SIDE HAND IN HAND WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. IN FACT I DOUBT THAT DEPUTY DIRECTOR HEARD ABBY'S NAY HAS TAKEN A PHONE CALLER IS DOING CALL THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ON IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS BECAUSE WE JUST HAVE BEEN. ATTACHED AT THE HIP- IN SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE- THE SUM IS GREATER THAN ITS PARTS THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IT CAL HHS THE EXPERTISE THAT WE BRING IN HUMAN SERVICES FIELD. IS ONLY BOLSTERED BY THEIR AMAZING EXPERIENCE FROM OUR L. WGA PARTNERS AND SO JUST REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE- JOINT EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGING IN BETWEEN HHS LWT ANY AND. ARE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER. THANKS TO SOME OF THE BUS. AND THAT YOU'RE MAN GETTING- MENTIONED EARLIER. IN A WE BEEN. FRANKLY STEP OF THE WAY- WE HAVE HAD MANY MEETING WITH LABOR GROUPS THAT COMMUNITY OR- I'M TO. GROUP AT AND ADVISORY. PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE- OF THIS WORKING WHO ARE LIVING THIS URGENT PROBLEM EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT WE NEED TO LEARN FROM AND THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE PACKAGE TODAY. YOU'LL I RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE TAKING THOSE VOICES INTO CONSIDERATION EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AS WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS INITIATIVE. AND SO WE ARE REALLY EXCITED I HAD TO TALK ABOUT THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTS AND- YOU KNOW WHILE SOME RIGHTFULLY SO WILL COMMENT ON. MAYBE AN ABSENCE OF DETAILS AND SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WILL THAT WE TALK ABOUT TODAY. AB WE MIGHT NOT KNOW EVERY SPECIFIC OUTCOME THAT YOUR SENT COMMITTEES ARE INTERESTED IN. I WILL SAY THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A BENEFIT TO US WE ARE LOOKING FOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WE'RE LOOKING TO. ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE ENGAGE WITH YOUR SUB COMMITTEES ON A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND SO. JUST REALLY EXCITED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. I'M ALSO BREAKING NEWS. LAST WEEK OUR WORKFORCE ROLLIN ISSUED IT WAS CHOSEN BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE LEARNING COLLABORATIVE. AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT OUR TEAM BOTH TECHNOLOGY JUST TEAM L. W. D. EIGHTEEN. WE OUR WORK FORCE FOR ALL INITIATIVE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH NATIONAL EXPERTS THE NATIONAL SUBJECT AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE FOLKS. TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE PACKAGING TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE OUR WHAT WE'RE OFFERING IN THE WORK FORCE FOR ALL INITIATIVE SO REALLY EXCITED ABOUT ALL THE COLLABORATIONS SO JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE COMMUNICATED THAT WITH YOU ALL TODAY. I'M GOING TO DO NOW IS HANDED OVER. TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR I AT LEAST NAY IN EXCUSE ME THAT MEANS THAT. WHO ABBY'S NAY IS GOING TO TALKING A LITTLE MORE THIS. I FROM THAT L. G. AND- ABBY. THANK YOU TO. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR CO. AND SHARE AROUND FOR THE- TO BE HERE SO. WITH YOU TODAY AND I CERTAINLY SHE HER THERE'S YEAH- ABOUT THIS REALLY EXCITED AND- AS WE THINK ABOUT. IN A- I INITIATIVE AND I WILL TALK BRIEFLY- TO CONTINUE DARCY'S OVERVIEW ON WHY THESE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE ISSUES ARE PROBLEMATIC FOR CALIFORNIA A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SHORTAGES OF HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND WHY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS IMPORTANT FROM THE WORKFORCE PERSPECTIVE. AS WELL AS OUR HEALTH CARE PERSPECTIVE. AS WE KNOW WHO THE CULPRIT NINETEEN ENDEMIC REALLY SERVE AS THE GREAT I'M MASTER OF INEQUITIES ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING THOSE FOUND IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKFORCE WELL WE HAD IDENTIFIED LABOR SHORTAGES OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE CRISIS WAS EXACERBATED AND ACCELERATED. BY THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC REALLY CREATING A NEW URGENCY HOSPITALS ARE SHORT STAFFED AND DESPERATE AND PAYING VERY HIGH REGISTRY RATES FOR A TEMPORARY WORKFORCE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AN ADULT IN SENIOR CARE PROGRAMS PROVIDING HOME AND COMMUNITY CARE ARE ALSO SHORT STAFFED AND CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE. TO MEET- STAFFING RATIOS REALLY AND PREVENTING FACILITIES FROM ACCEPTING PATIENTS READY FOR LOWER LEVELS OF CARE. ARE HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE DESPERATE FOR EACH CASE MANAGERS AND TEAM MEMBERS CHILD WELFARE SERVICE PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO PERFORM THE ASSESSMENTS REFERRALS AND ENGAGEMENT WORK NEEDED TO PLACE CHILDREN INTO OPTIMAL SETTINGS. AN OVER ARCHING PROBLEM MISTER SEA MANSION IS EVEN WHEN STAFFING CHALLENGES MAY BE LESS SIGNIFICANT IS THE LACK OF REPRESENTATION DIVERSITY. WORST LGBT PLUS STAFF AS WELL AS- WITH LIVE EXPERIENCES. AND OCCUR TRAINING. THROUGH OUR TRAINING SYSTEM OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM ARE ALREADY IMPACTING AND HITTING ROADBLOCKS AND COULD NOT PRODUCE THE BODY MUST HEALTHCARE WORKERS NEEDED TO REPLACE CURRENT HEALTHCARE WORKERS PROJECTED TO RETIRE. CURRENT HEALTHCARE WORKERS LEAVING THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE OF COLD INDUCED STRESS. OR TO MEET THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF A RAPIDLY AGING POPULATION. I SURE DARTH GARCIA IT DOESN'T FOR THE WAYS IN WHICH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND THE LABOR AGENCY ARE WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO PLAN THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM COMPONENTS IN THE INITIATIVE WHICH WILL BE ADDRESSED LATER THIS. IN THIS HEARING AND THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE LEVERAGING OUR COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE IS IN HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AND WORKFORCE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT IN CONSULTATION WITH ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS LABOR PARTNERS.

AS CHAIR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR UP FOR MY OPENING COMMENTS I WAS HOPING TO GET THE ADMINISTRATION'S TAKE ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU FEEL THAT THE PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS WHICH IS PRESENTED SUFFICIENTLY PRIORITIZES ISSUES OF ETHNIC DIVERSITY IN OUR WORKFORCE AS WELL AS ADDRESSES THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISPARITIES THAT SHOW UP FROM OUR WORK FORCE SHORTAGES HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. I MEAN I CAN CERTAINLY BE HANDED OVER TO YOU THAT'S OKAY SURE. SO YES WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE MEDIA EACH OF THE LINE ITEM PROPOSALS I DOES IN FACT. TACKLE APMEX OF DIVERSITY AND WILL LEAD TO A FOCUS TO ENSURE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE. TO ENSURE THE DOLLARS THEMSELVES ARE FOCUSED ON INITIATIVES PROGRAMS AND TRAINING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE- OUR REPRESENTATIVES- FOR EXAMPLE- ETHNIC MINORITIES LINGUISTIC MINORITIES PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES SUBJECT YOU TO CLASS STATUS. IN OTHER TYPES OF LIVED EXPERIENCE- AS WE GO THROUGH EACH OF THE PROPOSALS FOR EXAMPLE NURSING INITIATIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS FROM I THOUGHT I AM MY HOPE IS THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT ARE FOCUSED ON IN THAT DIVERSITY IS THE WAVES AS A CORE VALUE IN EACH OF THOSE ITEMS. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ANY OFTHE REGIONAL QUESTIONS THE DOCTOR AN ENVELOPE BROUGHT UP OR ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO ADD. WELL I WILL JUST ECHO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AND WE IT UP THE SECOND BEFORE YOU CAN CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOUR MICROPHONE YOU SOUND A LITTLE BIT FAR AWAY. I'M HAVING ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS TODAY BUT LET ME- CONTINUE IS THAT BETTER. OKAY THANK YOU TO ECHO WHAT GARCIA SAYING AS WE HAVE BEEN PLANNING FOR THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM COMPONENTS OF THESE INITIATIVES THERE ARE FEW THROUGH LINES THAT CUT ACROSS EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM COMPONENT ONE OF THOSE AND THEN THE TWO ONES THAT ARE MOST HIGHLIGHTED IN SIGNIFICANT AND CONSISTENT OUR DIVERSITY ACROSS THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES OF OUR STATE THAT- ARE NOT ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED IN THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE- AND HAVE BEEN REALLY HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS TO THE GOOD JOBS THAT THAT. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CAN OFFER- AND ANOTHER THROUGH LINE IS THE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THIS IS THE EMPHASIS OF BOTH OF THESE DIMENSIONS O DIVERSITY ARE NOT ONLY GOOD FOR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS BUT THEY'RE GOOD FOR INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE STATE TO GET THEM TO THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT WILL SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BRINGING UP THIS AND ISSUES TWO SEVEN AND ELEVEN LATER TODAY. BUT SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THIS ISSUE ITEM- WHAT WE HEAR THAT THE LOWEST PROVIDER TO POPULATION RATIOS ARE OFTEN TIMES IN THE INLAND PARTS OF OUR STATE LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THE SAN JOAQUIN. VALLEY AND IT SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT PSYCHIATRIST TO POPULATION US HAVING A THIRD OF THE PROVIDERS PER POPULATION THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE BAY AREA. THAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE APPROPRIATELY FOLLOWING UP. THAT AND UNDERSTANDING. WHAT WHY WE DON'T HAVE ANY DOCTORAL PROGRAMS AT ALL FOR PSYCHOLOGY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S AWFULLY HARD FOR US TO CATCH UP BEFORE NOT TRAINING THEM IN OUR BACKYARD. AND AS QUOTED IN THE AGENDA OF THE HELPS FORCE RESEARCHERS PREDICT THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT WE WILL HAVE AS A STATE. 50% FEWER PSYCHIATRIST THEN WILL BE NEEDED TO MEET THE STATE'S MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE WE SHORT TODAY- AND THEN HOW EXACERBATED IS IT WITH THOSE GEOGRAPHICAL DISPARITIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH DR ONLINE AND- I PROBABLY WILL FORGET. PARTS OF THE QUESTION THAT YOU JUST ASKED BUT I WILL SAY THAT I'M A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST BY TRADE AND SO TO HEAR YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY PROGRAMS IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT'S- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES SPACE. I'M SO I WILL HIT Q. Q. ADDED TOPICS ON NINE I DON'T HAVE THE VACANCY RATES OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT HAPPY TO BE BACK AROUND WITH YOUR TEAM TO PROVIDE THOSE NUMBERS. I'M FOR. SOME OF THE SITE VACANCY RATES ARE THE HIGHEST THAT WE SEE ACROSS ANY DISCIPLINE- FOLLOWED BY PSYCHOLOGY BUT DECK BUT PSYCHIATRY VACANCIES ARE DEFINITELY MORE OF AN URGENT ISSUE. AND SO TO OF THEIR PIECES BUT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT I KNOW THEY HAD A PIECE FOR THE PSYCHIATRY PIECE WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING A LITTLE BIT. LATER FROM DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS WHO HAS A PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WHICH I THINK YOU WILL ANSWER SOME OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO BUY. TWO OF THE INTERVENTIONS BEING ONE. RESIDENCY PROGRAMS TRAINING SITES WE KNOW. THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TRAINEES IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT'S WHERE THEY END UP NOT WORKING AND THAT'S WHERE THEY END UP-SETTLING DOWN. AND PUTTING THEIR ROOTS INTO COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CLINICAL SITES. AS A DANCE FOR PSYCHOLOGY A PRE DOCTORAL AND POST DOCTORAL INTERNS- IS A BIG ASSET IT. THERE'S A LOT OF LOW HANGING FRUIT THERE THAT I THINK THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN TACKLE IS THE STATE'S. SOMETHING THAT AND DEPUTY SECRETARY'S NAME MENTIONED EARLIER SPECIFICALLY HAS TO DO WITH HOW CAN WE LEVERAGE THE STATE. STATE FACILITIES STATE HOSPITALS ARE PRISON NETWORK WHICH IS ALL ACROSS THE STATE- AS CLINICAL TRAINING SITES FOR PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHOLOGY- RESIDENTS AND FELLOWS JUST JUST AN IDEA THAT WOULD LOVE TO ELABORATE ON- BUT IT IS THAT THROUGH CLINICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS HOW CAN WE TRAIN. HOW CAN WE EMBED THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. GEOGRAPHICALLY IN A SMART WAY GEOGRAPHICALLY BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN REGIONS THAT ARE A DESERT FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM WHEN IT COMES TO CLINICAL TRAINING SITES. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER ON. FOREVER BECAUSE ABBY DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT. YEAH I REALLY THINK YOU COVERED IT WELL DARCY. WHAT I CAN DO CHAIR AROUND A LOT JUST FOLLOW UP WITH YOU I'D MENTIONED THAT WE'VE GOTTEN REGIONAL BREAKDOWNS. OF THE LABOR MARKET INFORMATION DIVISION- PROJECTIONS AND CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON SOME OF THE SPECIFICS AND- PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR PRACTICAL THANK YOU I A I HAVE A QUESTION JUST WITH REGARDS TO PROCESS OF EQUITY AND DIVERSITY WE OFTEN- SPEAK ABOUT AND MAKE PLANS WITH REGARDS TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE COME ACROSS AND STUFF FOR. HAS BEEN- HELP PROP TWO OH NINE OFTEN GETS IN THE WAY OF REACHING THOSE EQUITY AND DIVERSITY GOALS IS THERE A WORK AROUND THAT OR WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW LANGUAGE- OPPORTUNITIES AND CAPABILITIES AS WELL AS CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND THAT DOES REQUIRE EQUITY AND DIVERSITY SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. UP THANK YOU- CHECK IDEA AND ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK AS AS CAME UP IN OUR- EARLIER. BUDGET HEARING THE KEY ONE OF THE KEYS TO- INCREASING DIVERSITY IN OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS WHICH LEADS TO GREATER DIVERSITY IN THE- IN IN THE WORK FORCE ITSELF. IS WORKING IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE CLOSED LINKAGES TO THE COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO SEARCH WHO CAN BE TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND PARTNERS IN. RECRUITING TRAINEES FOR THE PROGRAMS AND CAN ALSO OFFER THE KINDS OF- SUPPORTIVE SERVICES- THAT. ENABLE PEOPLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THOSE PROGRAMS IN TO FINISH THEM THAT CAN BE SUPPORT FOR CHILD CARE THAT CAN BE I'M- SUPPORT FOR TRANSPORTATION THAT CAN- IN IDEAL SENSES B. TRAINING STIPEND SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP JOBS TO PURSUE TRAINING. ON THE SET UP TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION PROBABLY A LARGER CONVERSATION ON ON RECRUITMENT OUTSIDE OF. A CBO ON THE GROUND WITCHES ARE OFTEN ALREADY INUNDATED OVERWORKED UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDER RESOURCED. SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW DO WE MAKEIT A REALITY. YES AND I THINK PART OF DOING THAT IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THOSE PARTNERS ON THE GROUND. THANK YOU.

NOW I WOULD DRESS THE QUESTIONS POSED IN THE AGENDA I'M ONE QUESTION ASKED COMING OR RESIDENCY SLOTS ARE THERE IN CALIFORNIA AS A RESULT OF THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM OR AS A RESULT OF INCREASED FUNDING. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN H. CHI RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM. BEFORE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE ANNUAL BUDGET FOR THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM WAS SIX POINT SIX MILLION I'M GOING FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AID IN PLANNING FUND. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE BEGAN RECEIVING AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY THREE MILLION ANNUALLY FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM. WITH THIS NEW FUNDING WE BEGAN TRACKING HER PROGRESS TO DETERMINE THE- EXACT MYSTERY THE IMPACT. OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OUR PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY TRAINING SLOTS. SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE SONG BROWN PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAM HAS SUPPORTED THE LAUNCHING OF THIRTY TWO NEW PROGRAMS. AND THE EXPANSION OF THIRTY SEVEN EXISTING PROGRAMS. WHICH RESULT IN AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN ADDITIONAL PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY SLOTS IN CALIFORNIA. IN THAT SAME TIME PERIOD THE OVERALL NUMBER OF SLOTS GREW BY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT SO THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM SUPPORTED TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN OF THESE. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THIS ALSO FUNDING SUPPORT. FOR PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAM. IF YOU WOULD LIKE WE CAN GATHER DATA BACK TO TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT WE WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THE IMPACT OF THE SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT IN THE SONG BROWN PROGRAMS THAT'S TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DR CATHERINE NATION WITH UNIVERSIT OF CALIFORNIA. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHARMELOT CHAIR CARILLO MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE- I SO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU THIS AFTERNOON- AND HAVE SPENT ACTUALLY MUCH OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER- ON TOPICS THAT ARE- PART OF YOUR PLANS FOR DISCUSSION THROUGHOUT THESE PANELS. ON AS WAS MENTIONED MY NAME IS KATHERINE NATION I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR HEALTH SCIENCES IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WIDE- OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK- TODAY JUST BRIEFLY AND MINDFUL OF TIME ABOUT THE CRITICAL RELEVANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION- AS A STRATEGY AN AREA OF INVESTMENT FOR MEETING OUR FUTURE- WORK FORCE NEEDS TO AND DR RONNY LIKE PARTICULARLY. APPRECIATED YOUR OPENING REMARKS. ON TO BE TO BE BRIEF- GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION OR RESIDENCY TRAINING IS BUT SECOND MAJOR PHASE OF MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR PRACTICING DOCTORS- THIS IS THE TRAINING THAT PROVIDES OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATES. WITH SPECIALTY SPECIFIC TRAINING THIS IS REQUIRED FOR LICENSURE AND FOR INDEPENDENT PRACTICE. OUR RESIDENT POSITIONS TYPICALLY SPEND SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND SEVEN YEARS IN RESIDENCY TRAINING DEPENDING. UPON THE SPECIALTY THEY SELECT. I WOULD CONTEXT- THERE ARE MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND MEDICAL RESIDENTS ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA TRAINING PROGRAMS. NEARLY HALF OF THESE PARTICIPATE IN OUR OWN UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SPONSORED AND CLOSELY AFFILIATED PROGRAMS. ACCORDING TO NATIONAL DATA FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES AND I THINK OF POINT OF SPECIAL RELEVANCE FOR THE DISCUSSION THIS AFTERNOON. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION. IN THE RETENTION OF MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS FOR COMPLETE THEIR TRAINING IN THE STATE. NOW ALL COME BACK TO THIS IS PART OF MY CLOSING REMARKS. NOT NOT NOT WITHSTANDING THESE VERY HIGH RATES OF RETENTION. THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION FOUND IN ITS TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FINAL REPORT THAT THE STATE WILL FACE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICIAN SHORTAGES. AND SHORTAGES OF OTHER HEALTH CARE PERSONAL AS WELL BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRD. THIS IS EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS AN AGING PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE WITH A TRULY A GENERATION EXPECTED TO RETIRE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE. OUR COLLEAGUES IN SPEAKERS BEFORE ME HAVE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION- WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS DO NOT CURRENTLY REFLECT THE RICH DIVERSITY. OF OUR POPULATION AND THAT TOO FEW ARE TRAINED IN SOME OF THE SPECIALTIES THAT ARE MOST NEEDED- WE WE'VE TALKED A LOT IN PAST YEARS ABOUT PRIMARY CARE WERE SPEAKING TODAY. ABOUT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH- CRITICAL AREAS. OF NEED I THINK IN OUR SHARED VIEWS. FOR OUR OWN WORK FORCED REALLY TO BETTER REFLECT OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION. IT WILL BE CRITICAL THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY. AND ALL OF PONSON OFFER DEPENDING UPON THE TIME ALLOWED TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR ARE YOU SEE- CRIME INITIATIVES WITH THE TWENTY YEAR HISTORY- AND-% CURRENTLY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX STUDENTS ENROLLED SIXTY EIGHT OF PERCENT OF HOME OUR OUR STUDENTS UNDERREPRESENTED IN MEDICINE I THINK THIS BODES WELL FOR THE FUTURE. FOR GMT AMONG THE RECENT STATEWIDE INITIATIVES THAT ARE INTENDED TO HELP ON HOW TO DRESS CALIFORNIA NEEDS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE OF UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OUR OUR SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- OR INLAND EMPIRE THE WORLD NORTH. CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION- FIFTY SIX IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THIS MEASURE PROVIDES FORTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TOBACCO TAX REVENUE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PURPOSE AND GOAL OF SUSTAINING. RETAINING AND EXPANDING GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS WHO PRACTICE IN THIS STATE. CREDIT PROGRAMS IN FIVE SPECIALTIES ARE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE EMERGENCY MEDICINE. FAMILY MEDICINE INTERNAL MEDICINE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND PEDIATRICS. FIFTY SIX FURTHER STATES THAT FUNDING SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR DIRECT MEDICAL EDUCATION BOB COSTAS AND FOR PROGRAMS SERVING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS ON AN AREA OF FOCUS THAT WE'VE LEARNED TO OUR PRIME PROGRAMS- HAUSER RECORD OF SUCCESS WITH CAREFUL INVESTMENT. TO ADMINISTER- THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS CHALAMET FORCED THE UNIVERSITY HAS RETAINED AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY. POSITIONS FOR HELPING CALIFORNIA OR PH C. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH US AND WITH THE STATEWIDE ADVISORY COUNCIL PHC HAS ESTABLISHED A STRUCTURE AND A PROGRAM THAT IS ALIGNED WITH THE AIMS OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX AND THAT IS COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE STATUTE AND REGULATIONS. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PC HAS MANAGED FOR COMPETITIVE GRANT CYCLES AND AWARDED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION IN SUPPORT OF. A TOTAL OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DURING OUR MOST RECENT CYCLE ALONE NEARLY A HUNDRED MILLION WAS REQUESTED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION WAS AWARDED ON TO SUPPORT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN POSITIONS. 83% OF THE HE'S SERVING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- AND THIS IS A FAST USING A PAYER MIX OF PROGRAMS MEDIC CAL DUAL ELIGIBLE INDIGENT AND UNINSURED. DESIGNATED HEALTH FOR SENATE HEALTH PROFESSION SHORTAGE AREAS OR HIPS THE COMMUNITIES. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT- ALTHOUGH OUR STATEWIDE FUNDING REQUEST CONTINUE TO FAR EXCEED CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS TO IT AGAIN FORTY MILLION ANNUALLY. THESE FUNDS HAVE ENABLED EXISTING PROGRAMS TO GROW AND THAT HELPED- PROVIDE CRITICALLY NEEDED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF NEW PROGRAMS. THIS FUNDING AND I PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE SAID WITH MY INTRODUCTION THAT I HAD THE LONG PRIVILEGE OF SERVICE ON THE SONG BROWN COMMISSION REPRESENTING YOU SEEK MEDICAL SCHOOLS ANALYSTS SAY THAT. THE STATE SUPPORT FOR SONG BROWN AND OUR TOBACCO TAX FUNDED PROP FIFTY SIX PROGRAMS OFFER ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR MEETING STATEWIDE POSITION NEEDS. ON THIS IS BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS STATED EARLIER- IN REMARKS BY OTHERS THAT THE LOCATION OF RESIDENCY TRAINING IS AMONG THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF FUTURE PRACTICE LOCATION- ALL WRAPPED UP HERE WITH A FEW LAST COMMENT SAY I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE VALUE. OF THIS INVESTMENT TURNOUT SONG BROWN PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX- IT IS ESPECIALLY NOTEWORTHY THAT RESIDENTS. ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THE STATE FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THEIR TRAINING. BOB THIS IS BY CONTRAST TO ABOUT 55% ON A NATIONAL LEVEL. AND AS I MENTIONED BRIEFLY AT THE START- CALIFORNIA PROUDLY LEADS THE NATION IN THE RETENTION OF MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS WERE TRAINED HERE. AND I THINK THIS REFLECTS A VERY HIGH RATE OF RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT- DOCTOR ON THIS PART OF YOUR OPENING REMARKS YOU YOU YOU YOU MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY- AND DEPUTY AND INCLUSION IN STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS AND ACCESS AND HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. ON TOPICS OF PRIORITIES I THINK FOR US ALL I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT YOU SEE MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN PARTICULAR HAVE ALSO RECEIVED SOME NATIONAL RECOGNITION- IN THE LATEST US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT RANKINGS FOR DIVERSITY WITHOUT FOUR OF OUR SIX UC MEDICAL SCHOOLS RANKING IN THE TOP TEN IN THE COUNTRY. WITH DAVIS AT NUMBER FOUR UC RIVERSIDE ARE OUR NEWEST AND YOUNGEST MEDICAL SCHOOL AT NUMBER SIX YOU SEE LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO- TIED AT NINE AND AGAIN OUR PRIME PROGRAMS ARE ROOTED IN D. I. D. E. I. AND- AND TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE SUCCESSFUL. JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT- ON BEHALF OF OUR PARTNERS AT PH C. AND CALIFORNIA'S GMB COMMUNITY I WOULD ALSO REALLY LIKE TO THANK GOD THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. FOR THE ADDITIONAL STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT TO THE PROP FIFTY SIX PROGRAM WHEN TOBACCO TAX REVENUES HAVE FALLEN SHORT J. J. INSURE THAT OUR ANNUAL PROGRAM REMAINS BUDGET REMAIN STABLE AT FORTY MILLION. NINE APPRECIATE. THE TIME TO BE HERE WITH EVERYONE THIS AFTERNOON. THE YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM BRENT HOUSE IS THE- DEPUTY DOOR OF OPERATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS PLEASE BE IN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBER SPRINT HEALTH SEARCHING DEPUTY RECTOR OF OPERATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS. BEFORE SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE D. S. H. MAP A RESIDENCY PROGRAM AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA I DID WANT TO TAKE A BRIEF OPPORTUNITY PER TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT STAY HOSPITALS. DEPARTMENTS THEY HOSPITAL'S MANAGES CALIFORNIA STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN OUR MISSION IS TO PROVIDE EVALUATION AND TREATMENT AS SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER. BY THE END OF PATIENT EXCELLENCE ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND SETTINGS. DEPARTMENTS THEY HOSPITALS ALSO KNOWN AS THE S. H. OVERSEAS BY STATE HOSPITALS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND EMPLOYS NEARLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND STAFF. IN ADDITION TO STAY HOSPITAL TREATMENT YES H. PROVIDE SERVICES AND CONTRACTED JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION AND PRE TRIAL FELONY MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION TO THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM. YES AGES WORKFORCE PROVIDING SUPPORT PATIENT CARE THAT SERVES OVER FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS AND DALY AND A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN HOSPITAL SETTING. THE INDIVIDUAL SURVIVOR SYSTEM OF CARE AMANDA FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT BY EITHER CRIMINAL OR CIVIL COURT JUDGE. WE SERVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PATIENTS SUCH AS BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIVIDUALS DETERMINED TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY AND INDIVIDUALS FROM CDC ARE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WHO REQUIRE INPATIENT HOSPITAL TREATMENT. DUE TO MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE INDIVIDUALS ON SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO TREAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF SOME OF OUR STATE HOSPITALS RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHALLENGING. AS A DEPARTMENT WE LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND WORKFORCE PIPELINE INTO OUR SYSTEM. AND ONE OF TH MOST CHALLENGING POSITIONS TO FILL A PSYCHIATRIST AND TO THAT END WE SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A RESIDENCY PROGRAM. SPECIFIC TORTILLA SAGE NAPA RESIDENCY PROGRAM THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT INCLUDED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM. I ONE OF OUR STATE HOSPITALS PSH NAPA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS WAS TO ESTABLISH A MEANS OF ATTRACTING OR RETAINING A SUFFICIENT WORKFORCE TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. TO PATIENTS. YES IT RECEIVED SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO OPERATE THIS PROGRAM. PRESENTS THE PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SAINT JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER AND YES H. NAPPER RECEIVED ACCREDITATION FROM THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL FOR GRADUATE MATCHETT MEDICAL EDUCATION IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH ENABLED RECRUITMENT FOR RESIDENTS. THE% PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM BEGAN ITS FIRST COHORT OF SEVEN RESIDENTS AND JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ORIGINAL PROPOSAL ONLY CALL FOR RESIDENTS PER PROGRAM YEAR WHICH WAS AN ESTIMATE AT THE TIME BUT WITHIN THE EXISTING PROGRAM BUDGET YES H. WAS ABLE TO FIND SEVEN RESIDENTS PER PROGRAM YEAR THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. ADDITIONALLY WE RECENTLY MATCHED ALL SEVEN OF OUR RESIDENCY SLOTS FOR NEXT YEAR AS WELL. THE RESIDENTS DEPENDING ON WHICH YEAR SPEND TIME IDEA STAGE NAPA UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED PSYCHIATRIST PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE THEREBY EXTENDING OUR WORKFORCE. WITH THE CURRENT CONTRACT IN PLACE TWENTY EIGHT RESIDENTS WILL BEGIN THE PROGRAM BY POSTGRADUATE YEAR FOUR. OF THOSE NO MORE THAN EIGHT WILL BE ON SITE AT ANY GIVEN TIME. GIVEN THE SUCCESS OF RECRUITING THE FIRST COHORT AND SECOND COHORTES DE S. H. IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING. I WITH ST JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER ON POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS PARTICIPATING AND A RESIDENCY PROGRAM GIVEN THE DUAL BENEFIT OF SUPPLEMENTING OUR WORKFORCE IN THE SHORT TERM AND POTENTIALLY GROWING OUR OWN WORKFORCE NOT LONG TERM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT TODAY AND AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. I WILL KEEP IT HERE FOR A SECOND AND FOLLOW UP- WE JUST HEARD- THIS QUESTION WILL GO TO KAREN RESELL IT I'M- GONNA ASK ABOUT THE TWO NEW PSYCHIATRY PROGRAMS THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT AS WELL AS THE NEW AND PEACE. PROGRAMS AND OVERLAY ARE COMMENTS FROM ISSUE ONE AGAIN. AND ASK IF THERE'S- PLANS FOR US TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISPARITIES THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU- SO. WITH THE- PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCYPROGRAMS- THAT WE- I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- THE MOST THOSE ARE- INTENDED TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVING- AND TRAINING IN THESE PARTICULAR IN TRAINING IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND SO IT'S REALLY NICE. REALLY FOCUS ON TRAINING PEOPLE TO SERVE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS- I ALSO LOOKED AT THE EXPANSION THROUGHOUT THE STATE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE A NEW PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN BUTTE COUNTY AN AREA THAT IS THE TIME TO SORT SHORTAGE I'M LOOKING AT CHARLES DREW- HAS A STRONG COMMITMENT. TO SERVING IN UNDERSERVED AREAS SO THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO YOU ON THAT DIVERSITY WE'RE TRYING TO EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY BUT ALSO EXPAND THE DIVERSITY OF THOSE SERVING IN WHERE THERE'S- WILL- MENTION IT AGAIN WE DO HAVE A STATE WE HAVE. MANY STATE HOSPITALS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITIES AS WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND AND GROW TO CONSIDER THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISPARITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED HERE TODAY. LIKE TO STAY WITH YOU MISS RESULT IF I CANNOT. EARLY BOTH PROUD AND APPRECIATIVE OF THE SONG BROWN FUNDING WE HELPED TO SECURE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP ON. YOUR STATEMENTS WHICH WERE MUCH STRONGER THAN- I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE FOR IT THAT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PROHIBITING SUPPLANTING OF THESE FUNDS BUT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP AND ASK WHY WE DON'T DO MORE OVERSIGHT OVER THIS PROGRAM YOU WOULD MENTION THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE A FISCAL AUDIT THUS FAR. AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK. WHY SHOULD WE HAVE THAT MUCH TRUST. HOW ARE WE ENSURING THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE GOING TOWARDS THEIR INTENDED PURPOSES- WHAT HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON IT AS I BELIEVE THERE'S CONFUSION REGARDING THE NEW AND EXISTING PROGRAMS ON WHETHER OR NOT AND HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE TO BE SPENT AND- HOPING YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME INSIGHTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND IF THERE ARE IS SOME CONFUSION THAT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW WHEN WE COULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP ON THAT IN TERMS OF. OF CLARIFYING THAT FOR THE PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM APPLICANTS. I'M AS I MENTIONED BEFORE- WHAT WE DO AT. BILL YOU KNOW WE- PUT SOME LANGUAGE INTERNET REIMAGINE OUR GRANT GUIDES IN TERMS OF REALLY- PROVIDING THE PARAMETERS IN TERMS OF HOW OF SPENDING THAT. THE FUNDING I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS THAT YOU DO HAVE TO IF WE WANTED TO DO FULL FISCAL AUDITS- BUT THAT THAT WOULD NECESSITATE- SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL- STAFFING AND RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I'M WE HAVE NOT BEEN AWARE OF ANY ISSUES AND- IN THAT IN THE USING OF THE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE. INDICATING THAT THEY ARE- INVOICING PERIODICALLY AND INDICATING HOW THEY ARE. USING THAT THE FUNDS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE- FOLLOW KIND. AND WILL IDENTIFY SPECIFIC SITES- WE HAVE A LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER IN DOWNTOWN FRESNO COMMUNITY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER THAT WHEN I SOKE WITH THEIR CEO CRAIG CASTRO WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A STREET RESPONSE. REGARDING HOW THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN SPENT OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN SUPPLANTED I'VE FOLLOWED UP THOSE QUESTIONS WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND WOULD NOW LIKE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION. TO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE GOING TOWARDS MORE RESIDENTS IN COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS AND BELIEVE THAT THEN ASSESS IT TAKES GREATER OVERSIGHT IF WE ARE NOT. PROVIDING THAT THROUGH OUR CURRENT- PROCESS AND- WOULD APPRECIATE A FOLLOW UP ON THAT SPECIFIC EXAMPLE AND- HAPPY TO GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS AS WE GO FORWARD. I WOULD NOT- MAYBE THEN I'LL I WILL STICK WITH THIS- REGARDING THE NEW AND EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WE SAW IN THE AGENDA ON PAGE TWENTY. IS THERE A IS THAT IS IT MORE BENEFICIAL TO SUPPORT THE NEW OR EXISTING PROGRAMS IS THERE A- HOW SHOULD WE BE BEST UTILIZING THESE FUNDS TO GET THE BEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WELL I MEAN AS WE KNOW- THE COST TO ESTABLISH A NEW RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT RIGHT IRAN IS LESS COSTLY TO EXPAND AN EXISTING PROGRAM AND OF COURSE AS LEAST COSTLY TO HAVE FIND EXISTING SLOTS- BUT WENT AT THE SAME TIME- YOU KNOW WE FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT ONE OF THAT. SONG RAP JENKINS- NOT ONLY TO INCREASE THAT- I DIVERSITY OF- THE- PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS SERVING AND WHERE THEY'RE SERVING BUT IT'S REALLY TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY TRAIN MORE PRIMARY CARE RESIDENTS WE MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A HUGE SHORTAGE AND SO WE THINK THAT THAT FUNDING PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND- AND PUT DOLLARS TOWARDS NEW AND EXPANSION- REALLY HELPS ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE SEEING. I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO PROVIDE THAT CLARITY BECAUSE THERE ARE CONFUSION AMONG SOME OF THE SITES ABOUT THIS THE FEELING IS THAT IF IT'S AN EXISTING SLOT THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN USE THE DOLLARS TO FUND THOSE EXISTING SLOTS AND NOT AS YOU STATED TO EXPAND THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS I WANT TO MAKE SURE FOR GIVEN DOLLARS WE'RE GETTING MORE DOCTORS. AND BELIEVES THAT THE CLARITY YOU PROVIDED JUST GAVE US THAT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE SITES HAVE THAT SAME INFORMATION AS WELL. WITH THAT I WILL PASS IT TO MADAM CHAIR TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS THE MY ONLY FOLLOW UP TO THIS- ARAMBULA WOULD BE TO GET. SOME KIND OF- TIMELINE AND DATE AS TO A COMMITMENT TO A DATE AS TO WHEN YOU WILL SEE. THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY EFFORT THAT YOU JUST RAISED IN YOUR COMMUNITY. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IN THESE HEARINGS WE HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION LET ME GET BACK TO YOU. AND THEN THEY LET ME GET BACK TO YOU DOESN'T ACTUALLY QUITE HAPPEN. AND THEN WE ARE AND THEN CHARGED WITH ACTUALLY PASSING BUDGETS- AND ALSO TALKING TO OUR COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT BUDGET REQUESTS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE. THE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS AND RESPONSES TO HOW WE BEST UTILIZE PUBLIC DOLLARS SO CAN WE GET A COMMITMENT AS TO WHEN MR ARAMBULA WILL BE RECEIVING. THE DATA THAT HE HAS BEEN REQUESTING THAT WE WILL FOLLOW UP IMMEDIATELY THIS WEEK- AND WHAT'S YOUR OFFICE AND THAT. YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION AS TO WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR YOU ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS A REQUEST FOR COORDINATION RESOURCES FOR THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY- THE PRESENTER FOR THIS PANEL IS GOING TO BE DEPUTY SECRETARY- ABBY'S NAME. MISS NAY YOUR BACK GARDEN HOPEFULLY WE- ARE ABLE TO HEAR YOU A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF YOU CAN PROJECT INTO YOUR MICROPHONE THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

WGA THAT ENCOMPASSES ENTRY LEVEL AND ADVANCED TRAINING PATHWAYS GROUP CAREER ADVANCEMENT. AND CHANGES IN REIMBURSEMENT AND CERTIFICATION TO APPROVE THE QUALITY OF JOBS. PLANNING FOR THIS INITIATIVE IS BEING CONDUCTED ALREADY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH C. H. H. S. WITH H. CRIED AND FOCUSED ON PROJECTED LABOR MARKET DEMAND WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. WITH NEW TRAINING PROGRAMS TO BE DEVELOPED THAT WERE BUILT ON BEST PRACTICE RESEARCH AND UTILIZE MULTIPLE TRAINING MODALITIES AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ALONG WITH A FOCUS ON PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE GOLD STANDARD APPRENTICESHIP. IN ORDER TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THIS EXCITING THE PROPOSAL AND PARTNERSHIP THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IS REQUESTING TWO POSITIONS AND A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR GENERAL FUND FOR OVER THREE YEARS FOR STAFF TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT. THE WORK FORCE FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE. AND FOR THIS NEW LEVEL OF COORDINATION WE SEE THAT WE REQUIRE AND ARE REQUESTING ASSISTANCE SECRETARY A RESEARCH DATA SPECIALIST TWO AND SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND TEMPORARY STAFFING IN CONSULTATION TO PLAN AND EXECUTE THIS INITIATIVE AND BUILD A SUCCESSFUL AND SUSTAINABLE PARTNERSHIP WOULD SEE HHS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BY PATRICK TOPPING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT THE FOR THE AD RIGHT NOW WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU L. L. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COREY WITH THE L. A. L- WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY. COMMENTS OR CONCERNS TO RAISE SPECIFIC TO THIS TO THIS B. C. P. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY I JUST A QUESTION FOR ME AS A FOLLOW UP. AS YOU'VE NOTED BEFORE THIS PROPOSAL SPANS MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. IS THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY THE DESIGNATED AGENCY THAT- TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND COORDINATE. COORDINATE THIS ENTIRE INITIATIVE AND- WHAT WILL BE THE ROLE OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WHAT'S SO EXCITING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IS A COLLABORATION THAT IS LEVERAGING THE CAPABILITIES AND COMPETENCIES. OF EACH OF THE AGENCIES AND THE LABOR AGENCY BRINGS OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING WORKFORCE. PROGRAMS FOR MULTIPLE KINDS OF A SECTOR INDUSTRY SECTORS EMPLOYER PARTNERS AND- COMMUNITY GROUPS AND CJ JUST BRINGS IT'S- REALLY AMAZING EXPERTISE IN ALL ASPECTS OF. HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH HEALTH CARE PLANNING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AND SO WORKING TOGETHER IN CREATING THIS NEW TRUE- COLLABORATION WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT OPTIMISTIC AND EXCITED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO- REALLY TAKE. THE KINDS OF TRAINING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I'M IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO BUILD A NEW HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE FOR THE STATE. AND AS YOU KNOWN AS WE WILL HEAR- INCOMING. ISSUE AREAS FOR THIS. HEARING IT IS THE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE- LABOR AGENCY AND ALSO ON A PARALLEL BASIS WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE. DOING THE- DIRECT PROGRAM ADMINISTER AND FUNDING. BUT THE LEADERSHIP AND INITIATIVE WILL BE TAKEN BY WHICH AGENCY SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD IT BE A COMBINED PARTNERSHIP AND RESPONSIBILITY OLD OR WILL IT. LANDYN ONE AGENCY SPECIFICALLY AND I ASK ONLY IN TERMS OF WHEN WE DO FOLLOW UP TESTS TO MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUTCOMES. THERE WILL BE THAT YOU'RE GETTING TO THE REALLY GREAT QUESTION ON EVALUATION AS WELL- GOOD TO AGENCIES WILL BE JOINTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR. ADMINISTERING THE ADMINISTRATIVE THE OVERALL INITIATIVES AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE PROPOSAL THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROGRAM COMPONENTS THAT WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENTS UNDER THE LABOR AGENCY AND SPECIFIC PROGRAM COMPONENTS- THAT WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT UNDER C. H. H. S. WHAT WE'RE ENVISIONING WOULD BE AN OVERALL AN ISSUE THAT THE EVALUATION. BUT BUT ALSO VERY SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE OF PROGRAM COMPONENTS. I'M SORRY I'M NOT ON THE AGENDA ITEM BUT TO ANSWERED JEOPARDY HAS QUESTIONED ITS-JOINTS WHEN YOU WANT RESULTS AND WHEN YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE OUTCOMES OF BOTH KELLY JACKSON L. W. D. I. THANK YOU A JUSTICE AS A FOLLOW UP TO THIS. EDT ALREADY PROVIDES THE DATA ANALYSIS INCLUDING LABOR MARKET PROJECTIONS WHAT WILL BE THE ROLE OF THIS NEW RESEARCH DATA SPECIALIST. THE ROLE OF HIS RESEARCH NATIONALIST WILL BE TO TAKE. THOSE PROJECTIONS AND REALLY CONDUCT FURTHER ANALYSIS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE GOT THEM ON A REGIONAL BASIS- THAT WILL REQUIRE EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS AND WE ARE EAGER TO GET THIS POSITION FILLED TO REALLY LOOK BY REGION BY OCCUPATION TO PINPOINT SOME OF THAT DISPARITIES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO PINPOINT OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING AND TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS THAT IS ONE EXAMPLE THERE IS ALSO EXTENSIVE RESEARCH TO BE DONE. TO- LOOK AT BEST PROGRAMS- DELIVERED ELSEWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY GARCIA MENTIONED ARE EXCITING ACCEPTANCE INTO THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION COLLABORATIVE BUT EVERY STATE IN EVERY MUNICIPALITY IN THE COUNTRY IS DEALING WITH- HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. AWARE OF AND BORROWING FROM IN REPLICATING SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES AROUND THE COUNTRY- I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS PERSON WILL BE VERY VERY BUSY THIS PERSONAL ALSO BE WORKING ON A PROGRAM DEVALUATION AND SUPPORTING THE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN L. W. D. A. ON AND- DEVELOPING THOSE EVALUATIONS AND MEASURING PERFORMANCE. EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. DOES THE EDT ANALYSIS CURRENTLY NOT TO A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THAT OR ANY REGIONAL APPROACHES TO WHAT THIS NEW RESEARCH AT A SPECIALIST WOULD DO. THEY DO THE REGIONAL BREAKDOWN AS I MENTIONED WE DID RECEIVE THE OCCUPATIONAL. PROJECTIONS BRKEN DOWN BY FOURTEEN REGIONS AROUND THE STATE- HOWEVER THERE IS ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS NEEDED- TO REALLY CONNECT THE SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONS- THE SPECIFIC SETS OF- JOB ADS- BY REGION. SO THERE'S A AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF ANALYSIS THAT WE ANTICIPATE THIS PERSON TO DO. AND WILL THERE BE COORDINATION BETWEEN WHAT EDT ALREADY DOES AND WHAT THE REPORT AND DATA ANALYSIS THAT THEY ALREADY PROVIDE OUR LABOR MARKET PROJECTIONS WITH THIS NEW POSITION THAT SEEMS TO OVERLAP IN RESPONSIBILITY. ABSOLUTELY WE ENVISION THEM WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER AND- THIS POSITION WILL FOCUS SOLELY ON THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND ENJOYMENT SERVICES WORKFORCE. ENABLE I THINK WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH L. L. MY D. TO DO SOME OF THE DEEPER DIVES AND LEVELS OF ANALYSIS THAT WILL ENABLE US TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM SUCCESSFULLY ALL THESE PROGRAMS SUCCESSFULLY. THANK YOU IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU TO OUR ISSUE NUMBER THREE PANEL WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO PRESENT ON THEIR HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIP FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WE WILL ALSO HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS YEAH YOU FOR THIS PANEL OUR PRESENTERS ARE- THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MISTER TIM RAINY. AT MATT LYNCH WITH- GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH US YEAH YOU MISTER RANEY ARE YOU ON IF SO YOU MAY BEGIN. I AM A TEACHER CARILLO THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA ON TO BE HERE. AS PART OF THIS BROADER INITIATIVE- THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IS REQUESTING THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS FOR HIGH ROAD. TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS FOR HEALTH CARE. THIS IS INDUSTRY SECTOR WORK- I WROTE IS A UNIQUE APPROACH TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IT'S VERY INDUSTRY DRIVEN. WE START WITH EMPLOYERS A LOT OF- OF COORDINATION AND DEVELOPMENT WITH EMPLOYERS IN ORGANIZED LABOR- OFTEN- WITH A COMMITMENT TO EQUITY JOB QUALITY CLIMATE RESILIENCY IS THAT AS THE END GAME- THE UNDERPAINTING- NOTION IS YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE EQUITY WITHOUT. PAYING A LOT OF JOB QUALITY- THE PROJECTS THAT WE THAT WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP CONDITIONS THROUGH THESE KINDS OF SECTOR BASED PARTNERSHIPS EMPLOYER PARTNERSHIPS FOR MOVING WORKERS. FROM DISADVANTAGED GROUPS AND POPULATIONS INTO GOOD QUALITY JOB TO ME TO FIND. OUT WHAT IT GOOD QUALITY JOB MEANS HIRING PLAYER- MEANS- OFTEN THIS WORK INCLUDES UPSKILLING CURRENT WORKERS. A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT COORDINATION AMONG LABOR MANAGEMENT TO GET THAT DONE AND WORKERS AT THE TABLE OR HER VOICE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THIS- AND THEN ALIGNING WITH SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES WORKFORCE BOARDS. COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO CREATE PATHWAYS INTO THOSE GOOD JOBS- OFTEN AT THE ENTRY LEVEL- SOMETHING WE CALL UPSKILLING BACKFILL VERY WONKY- CONCEPT- THESE ARE NOT ONE AND DONE INVESTMENTS THE INTENTION IS TO ESTABLISH LONG TERM INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE SUSTAINED- WITH THE INTENTION. OF CHANGING THE WAY WHOLE INDUSTRIES ARE RECRUIT TRAIN PROMOTE AND RETAIN TALENT AND DEVELOP REGIONAL TALENT- SO IT'S REALLY AND AN EFFORT TO CHANGE SYSTEMS AND TO IMPACT LABOR MARKETS FOR THE ENDGAME OF INCREASING EQUITY ECONOMIC EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE IN REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE- THE PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE. EMPLOYERS OF COURSE HEALTHCARE EMPLOYERS IN THIS CASE ORGANIZED LABOR WORKFORCE BOARDS. SCHOOLS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. ESPECIALLY THE CBO'S AS DEPUTY SECRETARY SNAPE POINTED OUT THAT WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT WORK THAT WE AIM TO IMPACT. THE HEALTH CARE HIGH ROAD BUT INITIATIVE WILL TARGET OCCUPATIONS THAT DON'T REQUIRE FOUR YEAR DEGREES OUT LARGELY ALLIED HEALTH- EVERYTHING EXCEPT DOCTORS NURSES MEDICAL ASSISTANTS RESPIRATORY TECHNICIANS SURGICAL TECHNICIANS PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS MEDICAL RECORDS. TECHNICIAN SIX IT'S ADDRESS WE PLAN TO TRAIN WITH THIS INVESTMENT OVER THREE YEARS UP AROUND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND WORKERS- IT THROUGH JUST THIS HIGH ROAD PIECE YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT OTHER- ESTIMATES OF TRAINS WERE TRYING TO GET SCALE- THROUGH THIS COLLABORATION. WITH HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES BUT ALSO ACROSS THE WORKFORCE AND TO TEACH. SO FOR OUR PART THAT CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE BOARD IS- ESTIMATING THAT WILL TRAIN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND WORKERS ITH THESE INVESTMENTS. AND I THINK AT AS THE DEPUTY SECRETARY ALSO POINTED OUT THE TEN YEAR PROJECTIONS ON GROWTH IN THE SECTOR AND I KNOW THE- IMPLEMENTED. OPEN DEPARTMENT IS UPDATING THIS DATA BUT THE CURRENT PROJECTIONS WE HAVE TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT'S TWENTY A- CHAU TO MILLION. HEALTH OCCUPATIONS OPEN OR JOBS OPEN- SO WE'RE JUST. I HATE SAYS GIVEN THE SERVICE THERE'S A LOT MORE TO BE DONE- WITH THESE- INVESTMENTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO GET AT SOME OF THE GAPS AND SHORTAGES AND HEALTH CARE ACROSS THE STATE- I'LL LEAVE IT THERE. AND I'M SURE. THANK YOU- MR LET'S SHARE LEAD JUMPS I'M SO SORRY IF I'M MISPRONOUNCING YOUR LAST NAME. NO TOTALLY FINE- MATT WAS A WITH S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING TODAY REALLY HAPPY TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT- THIS PROPOSAL ON THE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS- AND WOULD LIKE TO. THINK THAT CHAIRS THAT COMMITTEE AND STAFF. FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON THE CARE ECONOMY WORKFORCE WHICH IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AS WE- ARE CONTINUING TO BATTLE WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT THEN OF COURSE- PLANNING OUR WAY OUT OF IT AS WELL. TO ADDRESS THE CARE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA- EYES- MY CO PANELISTS JUST MENTIONED- THE COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS REALLY- SORT OF HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE GAPS THAT WE'VE HAD EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. IN TERMS OF A SEVERE GALA PARTICULARLY WITH ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS- OF YOUR CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS. ON CALIFORNIA'S FACING THAT SHORTAGE BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- THE SHORTAGES IS ALLIED HEALTH WORKERS NURSES PROVIDERS IN THE IMPACT THE MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS MANY LATINOS AFRICAN AMERICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS. WERE LIVING IN AN AREA EXPERIENCING HEALTH PROVIDER SHORTAGE. THESE ARE GAPS ARE PARTICULARLY FELT GEOGRAPHICALLY WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND INLAND EMPIRE WHERE THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF EXPERIENCED NURSES AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS. AND WE'RE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF VACANCIES RIGHT NOW- OUT OUR EMPLOYERS FOR POSITIONS LIKE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND LICENSE OCCASIONAL NURSES. REALLY ACROSS THE CARE SPECTRUM- MANY POSITIONS ARE OPEN. THE HEALTHCARE SHORTAGES ARE HEAT TO COMMUNITIES BOTH IN TERMS OF THAT- JOB QUALITY AVAILABLE BECAUSE HEALTHCARE JOBS ARE OFTEN GOOD PAYING JOBS ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PROVIDER TYPES. AND ALSO ON THE COMMUNITIES ABILITY TO ACCESS CARE. WALL WE ARE IN A SHORTAGE LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE HAVEN'T HAD A PANDEMIC OF THIS MAGNITUDE BEFORE IN IS REALLY UNCLEAR- THE IMPACT THAT THIS WILL HAVE ON THE WORK FORCE AND HOW IT WILL COVER- IT LIKELY WILL NOT BE THE SAME WAY AS IT IS- WE'RE COVERED IN THE PAST- THE WHOLE TRAINING PRE MODEL I THINK IS ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY PUT TO THE TEST AS WE- ARE CLIMB OURSELVES OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. EVEN IF THE GROWTH THE STATE WIDE EYED THE GROWTH OF- JOB TRAINING POSITIONS ARE. GROW STATEWIDE TO MEET THE PROJECTED- SHORTAGES THERE'S STILL AMOUNT DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE- WHICH IS STUBBORNLY PERSISTENT IN COMMUNITIES THAT WERE UNDER SERVED AD UNDER INVESTED. THIS UNDER INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR PROVIDERS THAT PRIMARILY SERVE THESE POPULATIONS HAVE LED TO IN IT ANY INEQUITIES IN GAPS IN THE WORKFORCE- BY PROVIDING. PROVIDER TYPE SUCH AS AFTER WE SEE CLINICS. LEADING TO HIGH TURNOVER IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS SUFFICIENT IN SUFFICIENT SUPPLY BECAUSE OF. THAT WELL RESOURCE PROVIDERS THEY'RE STILL ABLE TO SORT OF PULL FROM THOSE WITHOUT THE SAME RESOURCES. UNDER INVESTMENT COUPLED WITH STRESS AND TOLD A PANDEMIC IS TAKE IN A WELL DOCUMENTED IMPACT ON HEALTHCARE WORKERS WITH THE ESTIMATED ONE IN FIVE HEALTHCARE WORKERS. CONSIDERING LEAVING THE INDUSTRY. YOU MUST DO MORE TO RETAIN OUR CURRENT WORKERS BY RAISING THEIR WAGES AND PROVIDE CAREER LADDER OPPORTUNITIES. H. R. T. P. IN PARTICULAR IS A PROVEN MODEL FOR ADDRESSING THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WORKFORCE- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN R. EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE- 70% OF SEIU PARTICIPANTS IN H. R. P. P. PROGRAMS ARE WOMEN. 70% ARE UP PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ROUGHLY THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS AND INTO NEW JOBS- SEE AN AVERAGE OF- WE NEED TO INCREASE OF 45% IN HEALTH CARE IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONLY ABOUT 10% OF ENTRY LEVEL CLINICAL ROLES. HAVE ANY KIND OF- JOBURG THREE LADDER AND OCCUPATION SEGREGATION IS COMMON. H. R. T. T. R. LEXUS WORK DIRECTLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EMPLOYERS AND FRONTLINE WORKERS REMOVE BARRIERS TO IMPACT INVESTING IN VANCE MET AND DESIGN PROGRAMS OF WORKERS AT THE CENTER. LEADING TO HIGH DEMAND FOR HIGHER WAGE POSITIONS IN THE INDUSTRY WE NEED AN INDUSTRY DEMAND A WIN FOR WORKERS IN A WIN FOR EMPLOYERS. THIS ISVITAL BECAUSE MANY OF THESE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ESPECIALLY WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS ENTER THE FIELD IN ANY WAY THEY CAN. THEY'RE OFTEN OVER REPRESENTED IN ENTRY LEVEL NONCLINICAL ROLES. THESE ARE SOME OF THOSE THE SAME GROUPS ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN PRIVATE FOR PROFIT TRAINING INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE UP SIXTY EIGHTY PERCENT. OF TRAINING FOR OUR HEALTH CARE ROLES IN 50% OF NURSING SCHOOL POSITIONS. BUT OFTEN THESE FAIL ARE NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN FAIL TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION THAT LEADS TO A- HIGH QUALITY JOB- THESE PROGRAMS SUCH AS- THE ETP PROGRAM WHICH WILL BE HEARD LATER TODAY AND ALSO THE H. R. T. PEOPLE ROOM ARE SO IMPORTANT TO BOTH THE UPWARD MOBILITY OF WORKERS BUT ALSO ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY OF THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE THEY DO CREEK DECKER LADDER. THROUGH FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS WE HAVE DEVELOPED PROGRAM INNOVATIONS THAT SERVE OUR MEMBERS AND INCLUDES- INCLUDING COMPETENCY BASED REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIPS THAT ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NOR NEED FOR EARNING LEARN DURING CLINICAL AND X. IN EXTENDED ON THE JOB TRAINING EXPERIENCES. WE PARTNER WITH EDUCATIONAL PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY AND JUST THE TRAINING CONTENT TO MEET THE NEEDS AND THE SCHEDULE OF WORKING ADULTS THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT THE FAMILY WHILE PURSUING GRANDPARENTS SPENT. PROGRAMS LIKE ET P. AND H. R. T. P. LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP TO CREATE BETTER PARKWAY- IN OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM ONE JUST VERY QUICK EXAMPLE IS THAT THROUGH H. R. T. P. P. FINDING WE HAVE CREATED A PRE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL. TO CREATE A PIPELINE FROM NON INCUMBENT COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ON CALL NONCLINICAL WORKERS TO FULLY BENEFIT NONCLINICAL WORKERS THE CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT APPRENTICES. AND WE ARE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO DEVELOP BETTER FRIENDSHIP PROGRAM AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP MORE CAREER LADDERS. THROUGH I THOUGHT THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IF APPROVED. I THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT JUST REALLY WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING A CAREER LADDER WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DOUBLE DIVERSIFY. AND LIFT UP OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT- ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FIVE HUNDRED UP IN THE PUBLIC FINANCE NO-NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE L. A. L. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HI COREY HISTORY- WITH THE L. A. L. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY COMMENTS TO RAISE ON THIS THIS ISSUE AT THIS TIME. Q. I DO WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO THE MEMBERS OF THE DÍAS SIDE I DO HAVE ONE. QUESTION TO KICK US OFF- THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING VERY SIMILAR STRATEGIES AS- AS WE'VE- HEARD TODAY SUCH AS THE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS. DOES THE C. W. D. B. EXPECT THE ROLLOUT OF THIS INITIATIVE TO BE SIMILAR. AND CAN THE C. W. D. B. EXPLAIN HOW CURRENT HIGHROAD INITIATIVES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED NOW. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- YES IT WILL BE ROLLED OUT IN A VERY SIMILAR FASHION WE HAVE A AN APPROACH TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE CALL HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAS. ALL THE SAME ELEMENTS REGARDLESS OF THE SECTOR THAT WE THAT WE- WE FOCUS ON- AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE HIGHER TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS IN A VARIETY OF SECTORS. SUCH AS HEALTHCARE- INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION. CONSTRUCTION TRADES IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- SO THE APPROACH IS THE SAME. ENGAGING EMPLOYERS IMPINGING INDUSTRY ARE DOING A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT WORK UP FOR THAT WITH WITH INDUSTRY EMPLOYERS WORKING AS FAST AS WE CAN BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AS FAST AS WE CAN. GET OUR END GAME IS TO TRAIN. OUR TWENTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE IN QUALITY TRAINING AND TO GET QUALITY JOBS- SO I THINK THAT THE DIFFERENCE HERE. IS THE URGENCY AROUND HEALTHCARE AND FEELING IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE GAPS AROUND CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN THE IN THE PARTS OF THE STATE- SO THE DEVELOPMENT. SIDE I THINK IT'S GONNA MOVE FASTER THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST IN OTHER SECTORS- THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT HEALTHCARE THERE ARE ALREADY REALLY STRONG- PARTNERSHIPS WHEN AND- AMONG EMPLOYERS. AS MATT WAS LAYING OUT ESPECIALLY WITH THE EMPLOYERS THAT ARE SIGNATORIES TO. BUDGET YOU H. W. S. U. S. W. BOB SO WE CAN BUILD ON THOSE PARTNERSHIPS SCALE THOSE UP AND TAKE THE MODEL WHEN APPLIED TO A LOT OF OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AROUND THE STATE. SO IT WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WHAT WILL BE THE METRICS OF THAT WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS FOR EXAMPLE WILL. TIME TO HIGHER WAGES CAREER ADVANCEMENT BE CONSIDERED. YEAH ALL THE ABOVE WE HAVE A- ARE YOU WISHING THAT WE ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK WITH UCLA WITH THE LABOR CENTER THERE- THAT WERE APPLYING TO ALL OF OUR HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS INVESTMENTS- IT'S A MIXED METHODOLOGY SO IT INCLUDES BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ELEMENTS SO WE WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT. EMPLOYMENT POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT OF THE PARTICIPANTS SKILLS GAINS WAGE GAME- THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WORK WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'VE GOT TARGETS UP FOR OUR POPULATIONS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT SO WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT MAKE PEOPLE'S AS MATT ACTUALLY POINTED OUT- THAT SUV STRUCK IN THE VERY CLOSELY. RACES ETHNICITY GENDER AGE LOW INCOME STATUS- A FORMERLY INCARCERATED TO IS A BIG FOCUS OF OURS JUSTICE INVOLVED STATUS VETERANS BY ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS- AND I'M JUST ONE MORE THING THE QUALITATIVE. THERE IS- A RECRUIT- HIGHER UP SKILL- RETAIN TALENT REGIONALLY SO WE HAVE IN OUR FRAMEWORK ELEMENTS THAT INCLUDE- ARE WE IMPACTING ECONOMIC EQUITY AND MOBILITY ARE WE BUILDINGS- WORKER VOICE AND POWER- WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON QUALITY JOBS- IMPROVING JOB QUALITY- ARE WE BUILDING SUSTAINED INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS IMPROVING LABOR MANAGEMENT CORP OPERATION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR PROJECTS- ARE WE GETTING CO INVESTMENT- FOR SCALE AND SUSTAINABILITY FROM THE EMPLOYER SO IT'S ACTIVE TO THE- THE GOVERNMENT'S MONEY COMING IN. AND INVESTING THROUGH GRANTS AND THEN WHEN THE GRANT THAT FUNDS ARE GONE THE PROGRAM WORK GOES WAY ARE INTENTION IS THAT SUSTAINABILITY THAT MEANS EMPLOYERS INVESTING FOR THE LONG TERM SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE BOTH A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE MEASURES. WITH UCLA VERY MUCH I'M GONNA STICK WITH TIM RAINY IF I CAN ON PAGE TWENTY FOUR WITHIN THE AGENDA IT IT STATES THAT SIMILAR TO OTHER C. W. D. B. EFFORTS FUNDING WOULD BE AWARDED THROUGH REGIONAL GRANTS I WAS HOPING YOU COULD EXTRAPOLATE ON WHERE IS THIS HAPPENING CURRENTLY WITHIN- THE LOCAL THE C. W. D. B. AS WELL AS IS THIS TYPICALLY AN EQUITABLE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDING AS WE HEARD FROM MATT ABOUT HOW WE CURRENTLY HAVE A MAIL DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTHCARE RESOURCES. HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. YES WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN INDUSTRY BASED PARTNERSHIPS- BUT WE DO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO- TO GEOGRAPHY- AND WE'RE REALLY INTENTIONAL ABOUT ENSURING. THAT WE GET GRANTFUNDING TO THE INLAND PARTS OF THE STATE AND THAT'S BEEN HISTORICALLY WHAT WE'VE DONE NOT JUST WITH HIGHER TRAINING PARTNERSHIP WORKING HIRING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN FACT HIGHER CONSTRUCTION INCREASES AT EVERY CORNER OF CALIFORNIA- SO IT'S A- IT'S A PRIORITY OF OURS AND IT'LL BE A PRIORITY. IN THIS FUNDING IF WE'RE ABLE TO DO IT IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT- WILL BE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE PROGRAM FUNDING IN THE IN THAT PART OF THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT- I WANT TO UPLIFT- MAPS COMMENTS ABOUT 25% OF IMMIGRANTS IN OUR CARE. KANEMI RIGHT NOW AS- I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO CALL OUT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL IN OF CARED FOR US DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP IS GOING. BUT I'D LIKE TO THEN BE ABLE TO TURN AND ASK WHETHER OR NOT- WE HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR LINGUISTIC SKILLS. IS THERE ARE OUTREACH STRATEGIES WERE USING TO ENSURE A BROAD DIVERSITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW IS ABLE TO. COMMUNICATE AND ESTABLISH THAT TRUST. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'M GOING TO. REPEAT A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT- DEPUTY SECRETARY STATE POINTED OUT A LOT OF. THE WORK ALL OF THE TRAINING PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING WITH INDUSTRY AND ORGANIZED LABOR INCLUDING THE BASE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO REACHING THE COMMISSION PULL PEOPLE INTO THESE GREAT TRAINING PROGRAMS SO IT'S A VERY ESSENTIAL PIECE OF HOW WE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT HOW WE DIVIDE THE DESIGN THE INITIATIVE AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY FIND. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT. WE'RE NOT JUST ASKING COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS TO USE THEIR CURRENT CAPACITY TO HELP US. IN THESE INVESTMENTS IN THESE PARTNERSHIPS WE ARE REQUIRED THAT EACH OF THE PARTNERS IN THE PARTNERSHIP- BUILT INTO THE- BUDGET HOW MUCH FUNDING THEY'RE GONNA GET AS PART OF INITIATIVE AND IT'S TIED TO THE ACTIVITIES THAT THAT PARTNER WILL WILL PROVIDE SO THAT WE'RE SURE. THAT COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS ARE BUILT IN WITH CAPACITY FUNDING TO DO THE WORK THAT WE HOPE THEY'LL DO WHICH IS REACHING OUT TO HOSE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT MOST NEED. THAT MOST NEED SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BACK TO YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PANELISTS. OF ISSUE NUMBER FOUR REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL OUR PRESENTERS WILL BE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF. A AND A HIGH ME WITH THE ADDRESS AS WELL AS- THE L. A. O. AND B. YES WELL LET'S BEGIN MISTER WITH THE ADDRESS ARE YOU ONE. YES I AM THANK YOU- CHAIR CARDIO AND- CHAIR. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY- A YEAR AS PART OF OUR CORE FUNDING BE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL OR- DEVELOPS AND FUNDS APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND BUSINESSES AND OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND INCUMBENT AND NEWLY HIRED WORKERS PRIMARILY AND- CERTAIN AREAS OF MANUFACTURING. A GOVERNMENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONSTRUCTION TRADES AND OTHER CRITICAL INDUSTRIES HOWEVER ONE OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT I WE DON'T CURRENTLY FOCUS ON IS THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY- SO AS YOU KNOW ETP DIFFERS FROM OTHER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TRAININGS AS WE PLACE EMPHASIS ON EMPLOYER DRIVEN JOB WORKFORCE TRAINING- BY THE END OF THIS MONTH- THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL WILL HAVE DISTRIBUTED. APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND MONEY FROM THIS YEAR THAT WILL HAVE GONE OUT AND WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED OUT SO THAT IS ON TOP OF OUR CORE FUNDING SO TO THE POINT OF OUR INITIATIVE- EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL IS REQUESTING. YOUR SUPPORT IN DEVELOPING AND JOB CREATING IN AREAS A BACK OR ADVANCEMENT IN ENTRY LEVEL FOR WORKERS IN HEALTH CARE. HUMAN SERVICES STANDINGS AND SOCIAL WORK SETTINGS. THE FUNDING WILL GO DIRECTLY TO EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN TRAINING AS WELL AS TO ORGANIZED LABOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TRADE ASSOCIATIONS THAT PROVIDE TRAINING TO WORKERS. IN MULTIPLE EMPLOYER SETTINGS. THE ALL. PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE WAGE INCREASES AS WELL AS A COMPLETION AND IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE FUNDS I'M AS PART OF THAT EFFORT- AS PREVIOUSLY STATED- V. CORE INDUSTRY HERE SUCH AS MANUFACTURING CONSTRUCTION IS THE AREA THAT YOU CAN NORMALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE HEALTH CARE AND HUMAN SERVICES INDUSTRY PROVIDERS ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT THE AREA THAT WE NORMALLY PROVIDE FUNDING TO. BARBER THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE I WE WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY I DON' THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS TO BUILD THE SKILLS OF THEIR WORKFORCE SUPPORT CAREER ADVANCEMENT INTO MORE HIGHLY SKILLED AND COMPENSATED ROLES- TO THAT END ONE OTHER COMPONENT THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT ACT AS PART OF OUR- ETP'S NORMAL PROCESSES AND I HAVE THE ABILITY FOR US TO QUICKLY GET FUNDS OUT AND WE HAVE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. HAVE DEVELOPED INTO A GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS THAT IS AUTOMATED AND STREAMLINED IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE ABILITY OF GETTING THE FUNDS OUT SO WITH THAT HI MADAM CHAIR I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS BRIEF PRIVACY PRESENTATION- AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE PETER COOPER. WHO IS HERE. TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU- MISTER MACHINERY ON THE LINE. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER- COURT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT- LAST WEEK WE DID PUBLISH OUR ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNORS CARE ECONOMY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE- WE PLAN TO RAISE FURTHER COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED ASHY PACKAGE IN ISSUE SEVEN WHEN WE DISCUSS THE- THE MAJOR H. CHI BCTV- BUT WE DO HAVE JUST A FEW COMMENTSON THE PACKAGES SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FOR ETP TO RAISE- YOU KNOW AS MENTIONED EARLIER LIKE ETP PROVIDES GRANTS TO. BUSINESSES TO TRAIN EXISTING WORKERS- BUT DOES NOT- TYPICALLY FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE JOBS OR DIRECTLY ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO HIRE NEW WORKERS OR DO SO IN A WAY THAT DIVERSIFIES THEIR WORK FORCE WHICH ARE TWO OF THE OVER ARCHING GOALS OF THAT. PROPOSED CARE CONNIE PACK PACKAGE- YOU KNOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO- ALMOST DOUBLE THE GRANT FUNDING MADE BY ETP IN RECENT YEARS. AND THE PROGRAM ALSO ALREADY RECEIVED A ONE TIME INCREASE OF SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET- WE FIND THAT WE HAVE SUCH A LARGE INCREASE- COULD% PROVE CHALLENGING FOR THE ATP TO ADMINISTER- GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS YOU SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WISH TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE GOVERNORS- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE WE WOULD RECOMMEND IT CONSIDER WHETHER A SMALLER GRANT INCREASE AT ATP IS. WARRANTED AND IF SO WHETHER THOSE FREED UP FUNDS SHOULD GO TOWARDS OTHER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES- THOSE ARE ALL OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. A ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU CARE BETTER TOP AND APARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE MOVE FOR THE ADD ON THAT WE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT WHILE THAT DOESN'T INCREASE IT DOES PROVIDE IT DOES TRAINING PROVIDE UPWARD MOBILITY AND ALLOW NEW EMPLOYEES TO GAIN EMPLOYMENT AS PART OF THIS LARGER. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PACKAGE SO ON THE FOR YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR AN ADDITIONAL POINTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S THE BEGINNING COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DICE ALL BEGIN WITH JUST A COUPLE. HOW WITH THE E. T. T. P. PROGRAM DIFFERENT FROM THE C. W. D. B. PROGRAM. SO I DON'T START BY ANSWERING THAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. CORREO SO AS AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED- WE REALLY FOCUS ON THE INCUMBENT WORKERS MEANING THAT WE FOCUS ON THE FOLKS THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE GROUND WORKING WITH THESE EMPLOYERS. AND OUR GOAL AND OBJECTIVE IS TO UPSKILL THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR PROGRAM AND I'LL LET- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. I RAINY ALSO. CHIME IN IF YOU'D LIKE TO DO SO BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS ON OUR END WE'RE WALKING GAUGING DIRECTLY WITH A LOT OF THE INCUMBENT WORKERS ON THEIR AND THEIR- HIRING YOU. AND INDIVIDUALS INTO- INTO THEIR PROGRAMS. TO CHECK. OUT I'M GONNA- START MADAM CHAIR IF I CAN CONTINUING TO BEAT THE DRUM I'VE BEEN BEATING MOST OF TODAY. WHICH IS HOW WILL THIS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT REGIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING HEALTHCARE SHORTAGES HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. YES YEAH THANK YOU AND IT CHAIR ARAMBULA- WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OUR PANEL TO DIVERSE APPLYING THE AREAS IN WHICH WE PROVIDE FUNDING- THANKFULLY BECAUSE OF- THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND THE WAY OUR PANEL PROVIDES. THE FUNDING THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS WERE ABLE TO TAKE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS INTO CONSIDERATION AND WE HAVE DONE THAT IN THE PAST WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS ARE READY I'M PROVIDED WITH A FOCUS. AS WELL WHICH IS PART OF THE INTENT HERE. HOPING YOU COULD- FOLLOW UP ON WHAT THE L. A. O. HAD COMMENTED ON. AND WHEN I'M GOING THROUGH I'M NOTICING SIGNIFICANT WORKFORCE AREAS IN SKILLED NURSING AND SOCIAL WORK AND- COMMUNITY OUTREACH SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EARLY LEARNING AND CARE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT YOU. THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED WHETHER THIS IS SUFFICIENT TO WORK COMMENTS ON THE L. A- REGARDING. IT NEEDING TO BE SMALLER HOPING THE DEPARTMENT CAN PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT. SO FROM A AND B. EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL PERSPECTIVE. WE BELIEVE THE REQUEST OF NINETY NINE THIS IS ADEQUATE ON OUR END- AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EMPHASIS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT ON OUR END BUT NOT A LOT. THE INTENT OF THIS PARTICULAR INITIATIVE AND THIS FIND WOULD BE TO REALLY FOCUS IN THAT AREA AND IN ALL ASPECTS. OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AS A SAID THE AG IT IT VARIES DEPENDING ON ANYWHERE FROM. WELLNESS EDUCATION AND- MERGING SEE SERVICE AS- OUTPATIENT SERVICES ALL OF THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS SO THOSE ARE A LOT OF THE AREAS THAT WE DON'T TO ATP DOES NOT AFFORD UNFORTUNATELY DOES NOT PROVIDE A LOT OF SERVICES AND RIGHT NOW. BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE-THAT WE DO EMPHASIZE THAT AREA CONSIDERING THE NEED. BUT LET ME CHECK ON THAT NEED AS THE CHAIR SUB ONE WHO OFTEN. WILL HEAR FROM MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES ABOUT THE NEEDS FOR US TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND WORKFORCE AND THEN TURN THE QUESTION AROUND AND IF. IF THIS IS A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING HOW DID WE COME TO THE- ESTIMATION THAT THIS WAS THE BEST NUMBER FOR US TO CHOOSE HOW DID WE- PICK NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I AM SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE LOOKED AT IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH THE FUNDS. WELL AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE ALREADY PROVIDED MINIMAL SERVICES IN THEIR HEALTHCARE AREA. AND WE IDENTIFIED HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS WE COULD SERVE WITH WHAT THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY RIGHT NOW IF THIS GOES TO HAVE THE FULL NINETY MILLION. WE'RE PROJECTING TO SERVE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE. THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS AS PART OF THIS EFFORT BUT WE TOOK THE BASIS OF- THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS THAT GO INTO THE TRAINING WHAT TYPE OF TRAINING IS THAT THEY WOULD BE INVOLVED IN OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY- BUT BASED ON THAT WE- DID WE TOOK A GENERAL. OVERVIEW OF THAT AN AVERAGE OF IT AD THEN IDENTIFIED THE FUNDING AMOUNT. OF HEAT YOUR STATEMENT AS THERE WAS YOU FOCUSED ON THE NUMBER THAT YOU WOULD TRAIN. BUT DO YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. THE NEED IS FOR US IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE WE COMPLETED A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AND HOW FAR WILL THIS NUMBER OF PROVIDERS. TAKE US IN ADDRESSING THAT NEED QUESTION AND SO WE DID. I LOOK AT LABOR MARKET INFORMATION FROM EDT IS LET MARKET INFORMATION DIVISION. THE NEED IS OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER. THAN NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR ACTIONS PARTY THINK PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU'RE SEEING MULTIPLE REQUESTS HERE. FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THE NEED IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER. THE NEED FROM OUR END IS FROM THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL AND THE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IS BASED PRIMARILY ON THE FACT THAT- WE'RE WE KNOW WE'RE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY WITHIN OUR CURRENT PROCESSES RIGHT NOW. IF WE WERE TO ASK FOR A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER BUCKET OF MONEY THEN WE WOULD- HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HAVE TO INCREASE OUR WORKFORCE WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT INCREASING. OUR STAFFING LEVELS BY ANOTHER TWENTY P. WISE IN ORDER TO MEET SOME OF THESE OTHER DEMANDS BUT- IF WE WERE TO INCREASE ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT WE HAVE TO GET SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO DO THAT WE'RE JUST LUCKY TO. BE ABLE TO HELP AS. MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH WHAT WE CAN. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR. THANK YOU JUST A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS WHO WILL CONDUCT WITH THE THIRD PARTY ASSESSMENT ASSESSMENTS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND HOW WILL THAT THIRD PARTY BE SELECTED WHAT OUTREACH STRATEGIES WILL BE USED TO ENSURE A BROAD SERVER CITY OF COMMUNITIES CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RECRUITMENT TRAINING AND JOBS OFFERED THROUGH THESE- THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU FOR THE CHAIR AT THE QUESTIONING CARE. SO YES WE ARE PLANNING TO DO AT AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION AND WE ARE GOING TO FOLLOW THE OPEN PROCUREMENT PROCESS MEANING WE WILL PUT OUR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE- PUBLICLY TO ANYONE AND EVERYBODY THAT'S INTERESTED- AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS WILL IDENTIFY AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR THAT WILL. THEN DO AN EVALUATION AND OUR INTENTIONS ARE TO HAVE AN EVALUATOR THAT WILL- END INCLUDE NOT ONLY THIS PROGRAM BUT SOME OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL. SO WHAT. MY FOLLOW UP TO THAT SAME QUESTION WAS WHAT ARE THE OUT WE TRIED STRATEGIES THAT WOULD BE USED TO ENSURE THAT THROUGH THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND YOUR EVALUATION. OF THOSE THAT SUBMIT- THERE IS A BROAD DIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. AND MAN IF I MAY ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THAT ARE USED TALKING SPECIFICALLY TO BE EVALUATOR THAT WOULD BRING ON BOARD. CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU OKAY- SO WE DO HAVE OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD FOLLOW THE PROCUREMENT PROCESSES WHICH AT WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT OF WHAT WE DO THERE- THEY THEN ALSO PROVIDE THE R. F. P. TWO DG ASKED THE POST ON THEIR SITES WE POSTED PUBLICLY ON OUR SITE- SO GETS POSTED EVERYWHERE WE ALSO AND- THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL ALSO DOES HAVE. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT UNIT THAT DOES OUTREACH WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER- EMPLOYMENT IN IN AREAS AND HOW AND THEY WOULD ALSO THEN BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TO GET THE WORD OUT THAT WE HAVE THIS. EVALUATION IN PLACE AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN EVALUATOR AND THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HOPEFULLY. ALLOW US TO BRING IN A BROAD ARRAY OF APPLICATIONS AND ALL. CAN YOU PROVIDE US WITH A LIST OF THE CURRENT STATE WIDE CBO'S THAT YOU HAVE ON FILE THAT WOULD BE USED IN WHAT IS THE MEASUREMENT OF SUCCESS THAT THEY HAVE HAD IN THE PAST. BECAUSE I KEEP HEARING CBO'S ARE A LARGE PART OF THE ANSWER. BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AS THE CBO'S ARE ALSO. INCREDIBLY UNDERFUNDED AND OVERWORKED AND I'M JUST CURIOUS% AS TO. WHAT THAT CURRENT LIST OF CEOS ACROSS THE STATE LOOKS LIKE REGIONALLY. TO ENSURE THERE'S A BROAD A BROAD STRATEGY OF. AS WE THINK ABOUT MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I CAN FROM THE- PLAN TRAINING PANEL WE CAN PROVIDE YOU A COMPLETE LIST OF THE CBO THAT WE UTILIZE I'M I'M HAPPY TO COORDINATE SOME INFORMATION WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE COMPACT CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- AS WELL AS THE- WORK FOR SERVICES BRANCH YET EDT. TO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE ALL OF THAT CBO SAID DAVE- WORK WITH THAT AS WELL. RIGHT THAT. THANK YOU I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED TODAY THAT CURRENTLY- DON'T SEE RESOURCES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL OTHER VARIOUS ASPECTS TO UPSKILLING THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE ONE OBTAINING LICENSING OR ASSERTIVE- CERTIFICATIONS TO SKILLBASED TRAINING WHAT ARE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF HOW ETP WILL UP SKILL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE WORKERS. THANK YU FOR THE QUESTION NOW I'M SURE AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW MY COLLEAGUE AT PETER COOPER TO JUMP IN AND PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ON THAT. THAT'S OKAY. YEAH PETER COOPER A PLYMOUTH TRAINING PANEL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO WE DO WORK WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS ACROSS THE STATE- AS WELL AS CEOS AND- WHEN WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH EMPLOYERS NEED TRAINING IS REALLY DRIVEN BY THEIR THEIR NEEDS- WHAT KIND OF SKILLS THEY NEED AND SO FOR THIS FUNDING THIS WOULD LOOK SIMILAR AND WHEN WE GET WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE UPSCALING FOR. JOBS LIKE PHLEBOTOMIST OR MEDICAL TECHNICIANS AND I'LL IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT- JOB CLASSIFICATIONS THAT. THAT OR MENTIONED EARLIER AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS- CAL. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YOU TO THE PANEL ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX- OUR LAST LABOR RELATED ISSUE FOR THIS ISSUE WE WILL HEAR FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES. FOR FROM THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT SENSE EDT PROPOSES TO IMPLEMENT AN EMT TRAINING PROGRAM THAT WAS BASED ON A PILOT PROGRAM IN ALAMEDA WE WILL HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PILOT PROGRAM AS WELL.

HEALTH SYSTEMS. ARM I WOULD SAY LITTLE ABOUT MY BRANCH- MY BRANCH WE MINISTER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WE OVERSEE SIXTY SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND ARE WILL FEDERAL DOLLARS ARE WITH INTACT MINISTRY CAPACITY WE ALSO OVERSEE- ARMS THE SOLICITATION OF GRANT APPLICATIONS AND THOSE PROCESSES WOULD BE UTILIZED FOR THIS INITIATIVE AS WELL- WE HAVE UNITS DEDICATED TO. DEVELOPING THE SOLICITATIONS AND WE HAVE A UNIT DEDICATED TO MANAGING THESE CRACKS SO WE WOULD HAVE WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PROCESSES TO CONDUCT THIS INITIATIVE AND ALSO I WOULD- WE HAVE A PORTION OF WHAT WE CALL IN THE WORK FORCE DURING. THE GOVERNOR'S DISCRETION DOLLARS FOR WE OUGHT AND WE ARE PORTION OF IT IS FOCUS TO WHAT WE CALL SPECIAL POPULATIONS THESE ARE UNDER REPRESENTED ON MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE UNDER REPRESENTED SECTORS AND REPRESENTATIVES SERVICE LEVELS ON OUR PROGRAMS- WE SEE THIS IS. THIS EMT PROGRAM IS ALSO FOCUSED ON- TARGETING YOUTH YOUTH WITH DISADVANTAGES. ADMINISTRATED BY THE MODEL ALAMEDA WHICH WE'LL GET TO HEAR MORE DETAIL FROM MR BRISCOE- MCUS THESE BE- TARGET YOUTH WITH BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT- BIT WAR WE SEE SOMETHING THE NEW INFORMATION THAT WILL COME ABOUT FOR THE WORK FORCE WORLD IS THAT IT WOULD SEE THE FORMATION OF PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL PUBLIX HEALTH SYSTEMS ARM AND THEIR CONTRACTORS MERCY MEDICAL PROVIDERS WE SEE THAT MOVING FORWARD I HAVE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ON A SYSTEMS CHANGE PIECE. PIECE FOR US- THE OUTCOME DATA- WE WILL BE FOCUSED ON IS OF COURSE ACHAEMENID EMPLOYMENT AFTER COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM.

TO HELP THEM WITH REAL TIME INFORMATION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO THEM BEING SUCCESSFUL AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS ESSENTIAL IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS A SUSTAIN PROGRAM BEYOND THE TERM OF THE GRANT AND HAVE THAT SYSTEMS TEAM THEY WERE. AIMING FOR- WITH THAT I WILL- INCLUDE MY BE STATEMENTS REGARDING THIS PROGRAM. AND LOOK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MR BRISCOE. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY- IT'S MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY- I'M GOING TO QUICKLY TAKE YOU THROUGH THE HISTORY AND THE DESIGN OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY EMS CORE- AND WHILE IT MAY SEEM ALTERNATING CLEAN AND TIDY- I THINK ANYBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS WORK WILL SEE- LOTS OF REALLY TOUGH LESSONS LEARNED. FROM TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD I AM THE PREVIOUS DIRECTOR OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY THAT'S THE HEALTH AUTHORITY IN THE EAST BAY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AND AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES DO IS PROVIDE ALL HEALTH CARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN DETENTION. AND HISTORY OF THE ARMENIAN ON IBM ESCORT BEGINS THAT. WHEN ONE OF OUR STAFF MIKE GIPSON- AFTER RECOMMEND THE MIDDLE THAT PICTURE. COMING UP MONDAY BECAUSE HE HAD BINGED DOING SOME TRAINING FOR MSME AGENCY AFTER CAMP A CAMPER LAST THE ALEX WE GOT SOMETHING HERE YOU GOTTA COME CHECK IT OUT. AND HE WAS DOING A PRE COURSE FOR EMS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN DETENTION. AND I HE SAID ALL OF THEM WERE SUPERINTENDENT SUPERSIZED. SO WE OPEN THE BUILDING ARE ARE YOU DEVOTE ARE SHE'S ME ARE AUTHORITY BUILDING AT NIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE STARTED SHOWING UP. AND FAST FORWARD OVER TEN YEARS. WE HAVE NOW GRADUATED NINETEEN COHORTS A NEW COHORT WILL BEGIN NEXT WEEK. THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY GRADUATES SINCE 2017100% OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE PASSED THE NATIONAL REGISTRY THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE SO DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. SYSTEM INVOLVED ISN'T PROPERLY SUPPORTED ARE AWESOME. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OF MY WORKING IN THE FIELD. 30% HIGHER ADD SEVENTEEN OUR FIREFIGHTERS. I COULD GO ON- YEAH I HAVE RUN HOSPITALS ONE OF THE BUSIEST NINE ONE SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND NUMEROUS OTHER SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND SAFETY NETS THIS IS PART OF WHERE THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAM I HAVE EVER BEEN A PART OF. AND I'M DEEPLY COMMITTED PERSONALLY PROFESSIONALLY SYSTEMS EXPRESSION. SO WHAT DO WE LEARN. WE LEARNED THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE FROM THIS WORK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO PREPARE THEM TO SUCCEED. SO WE ACTUALLY DOUBLED THE LENGTH OF THE TRAINING FOR EMS. MEETING INSTEAD OF THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOURS INTO TRAINING THAT IS THE NORMAL COURSE WE DON'T WANT TO THREE THIRTY HOURS. WE DID A QUICK COURSE IN MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY SO THAT WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST ENCOUNTER THE STANDARDIZED INTO CURRICULUM THEY HAVE SEEN ALL THE WORKS BEFORE. WE ALSO TRIPLE THE NUMBER OF RIDE ALONGS. AND RETAILERS THE EDUCATION INDIVIDUALLY TO EVERY YOUNG PERSON'S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND THEN WE DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE. PROGRAMS CASE MANAGEMENT MENTORSHIP WITH A PERSON OF COLOR FIRE SERVICE FOR PARAMEDIC SERVICE. YOU LIKE CIRCLES WHICH IS REALLY COOL FOR MENTAL HEALTH. LIKE COACHING AND- A NUMBER OF OTHER OUR WORKPLACE SUPPORTS INCLUDING JOB READINESS SUBSTANCE TRAINING. AND THEN FINALLY WE PROVIDE A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR A MONTH MONTHLY STIPEND FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE SUCCEED. AND ONE MORE TIME WE DIDN'T THIS WASN'T THE PROGRAMMER WE STARTED. WE WE GOT IT ALL WRONG NUMBER OF TIMES AND REALIZE THAT WE HAVE TO PAY ON PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT WE HAVE TO TRAIN THEM CAREFULLY. I BUT IF WE DID WHAT WE GOT WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND SHE'S. WE ALSO PROVIDE FREE SERVICE WHERE EMTS TRAIN MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AND HIGH SCHOOLERS ON CPR. AND LAST YEAR WE ARE GOING TO REPLICATE THE PROGRAM IN NEW MEXICO AND WE HAD OUR FIRST COWORKER GRADUATED LAST YEAR JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF LITTLE TASTE OF IT. THIS IS DANTE. DANTE WAS UNEMPLOYED.

WELL WE HAVE FROM WORKING WITH ABBY AND HOW THEIR END CAME IN THEIR TEAM WE CREATED THE FOLLOWING CONCEPT LAUNCHED TEN TO FIFTEEN SITES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS EACH SIDE CUSTODY FORTY CORPS MEMBERS THAT'S ABOUT FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED EMTS ANNUALLY. I'M SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR AND SIX THOUSAND TOTAL OUR TRAINEES. YES HE IS TRAINED AND CERTIFIED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAM. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM IT'S AN UNHOLY MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHO OVERSEES THE SYSTEM. FIRE DEPARTMENTS YOU FOR SPONSORED AN AMBULANCE SYSTEMS WHO TRANSPORT AND BILL THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT IN THE STATE WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING HERE IS PARTNERS LEVERAGING THE PURCHASING POWER. OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. RIGHT ALL THE STANDING ORDERS. OVERSEES AND MANAGES ALL TRAINING AND DELIVERY OF THE NINE ONE SYSTEM IN EVERY JURISDICTION IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE SYSTEMS HAVE NEVER TRAINED THEM ONLY CERTIFIED TRAINING PROGRAMS THE REAL INNOVATION OF THE MS SCORE IS WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT CREATES ITS OWN TRAINING PROGRAM AND PRIVILEGES THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR EMPLOYMENT IN THE NINE ONE SIX. ONE SYSTEM THAT THEY OVERSEE. HERE'S A BRIEF TIMELINE OVER FIVE YEARS NOW WE WILL LAUNCH WELL THE THIRTEEN SITES. I'M INTERESTED RIGHT ON TIME TO TAKE AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU'VE GOT A TALK ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. FOREVER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER RISK APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY I LOST TRACK OF MY ALL OF MY PAPERS THAT I. HAVE IN FRONT OF ME. HELLO WHICH PAPER I'M LOOKING AT- JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATED IN THE PILOT PROGRAM. I BELIEVE YOU HAD IT IN IN YOUR SLIDE BUT I MAY HAVE MISSED IT. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE SO FAR OVER NINETEEN COHORTS. THERE ARE TWO COURTS A YEAR THE TRAINING PROGRAM IS ABOUT SIX MONTHS LONG INVESTMENT IN THE PILOT PROGRAM IN ALAMEDA. YEAH THE ORIGINAL RESTAURANT WAS WELL THE FIRST THREE YEARS THERE WAS NO INVESTMENT WE ALL DID IT ON EVERY TIME SO ONE IS FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT EVALUATION LIKE WE KNEW THIS WAS RIGHT WE ALL BELIEVE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE COULD BE INCREDIBLE WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW. BUT THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE FORMAL PROGRAM WERE FUNDED BY THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. DOLLARS TWICE. TOLD HIM ONCE THAT THAT'S THAT'S TWO COHORTS OF FIFTEEN TO TWENTY. WHERE MEMBERS OF PEACE AND WHAT IS THE WEIGHT OF ONCETHE INDIVIDUALS- PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND THEY GRADUATE FROM IT WHAT IS THE- I GUESS THE RATIO OF HIGHER OF THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE- PILOT PROGRAM. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE NINETEEN COURTS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ARE WORKING. IT'S GREAT AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE AVERAGE SALARY IS OF. YES YES ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YEAH HE AND HE STARTS AT AROUND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AN HOUR. BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND ABOUT HIM SHE IS IT'S THE FIRST STEP. ON THE PATHWAY TO MEDIC. OR NURSE OR THE REST OF THE ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS. I'M NOT BEING AN ISSUE FOR YOUR WHOLE ENTIRE CAREER ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS. A LOT OF EMTS ARE TRYING TO GET HIRED BY FIRE. SO WHAT THAT DOES IS FIRE HIRES OUT OF THE IMPACT AND IT CREATES A NATURAL CHARM. THAT ALLOWS FOR ON CONSISTENT OPPORTUNITY FOR HIRING. THE OTHER BIG PLACE THAT EMTS ARE GETTING HIRED INCREASINGLY IS IN MODEL MODE RECEIVING CENTERS. AND IN SOBRE DETOX FACILITIES AS FRONT DOOR STAFF BASICALLY THINK OF LIKE A INTAKE. OR CHARGES WILL. I THANK YOU FOR THAT I BRING UP THESE QUESTIONS JUST TO THINK ABOUT. INCOME INEQUALITY- AND THE INVESTMENT THAT IS CLEARLY NEEDED BUT ALSO. LIVING WAGES MAKING EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IN LOS ANGELES AT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR EVEN IN SOME A LOT ACTUALLY SEVERAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. JUST MAKES IT ALMOST NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE THAT LEVEL OF STRESS THE LEVEL OF JOB THE LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY. AT EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR DOESN'T SEEM FAIR- AND IT CERTAINLY DOES SOMETHING FOR US TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE. FOR A WORK FORCE THAT SO DESPERATELY NEEDED MISTER AMBULANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I'M GONNA CONTINUE WITH MR BRISCOE IF I CANNOT I FIRST HAVE TO SAY HOW PLEASED I AM WITH THIS PROPOSAL KNOWING THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT EMTS PLAY OVERALL IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND- AGREE WITH YOU ON THE TURN AND NATURAL TRANSITION THAT OCCURS. AS THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE LATTER BUT I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE GRADUATES THAT YOU MENTIONED AS I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE SAYING THAT THE PICTURE PRESENTED ONLY HAD. MALES IN IT. I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY OF THOSE GRADUATES ARE FEMALES AND HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROGRAM AS WELL. THANK YOU AND- SO THE PROGRAM IS NOW CO ED BUT WHEN WE STARTED WE STARTED DURING THE MY BROTHER'S KEEPER TIME AND WE ALSO FRANKLY MADE NO APOLOGIES AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO BRING YOUNG MEN OF COLOR INTO HEALTH CAREERS. SO THE FIRST WELL ACTUALLY THE FIRST CAR WAS CONRAD AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE FLIPPANT BUT WE WERE READY- THANK WE DIDN'T HAVE THE STAFFING APPROPRIATE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE GENDER AND THE TRAUMA SENSITIVITY WE NEEDED AND IT WAS. A TOTAL DISASTER CERVANTES RESTRICTED TO- JUST MEN AND IS NOW COED AGAIN AND THE PROGRAM WE STARTED IN NEW MEXICO IS GOING TO FROM JOHN I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME I'M SORRY I'M ACTUALLY CAN GET IT FOR YOU ABOUT THE TOTAL NUMBER TRAIN BUT I WOULD VERY APPROXIMATELY THINK THAT I'M TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY I HAVE BEEN BOYS. OR YOUNG MEN TO ME.WHAT WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE WITH THE GROWTH AND SCALING OF THIS PROGRAM FOR THAT CONTINUED RATIO OR THEIR INTENTIONS. TO HELP TO ADDRESS THAT DISPARITY. NO WE WILL BE OUT WE WILL BE CO ED AND SEEK- THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF MEN AND WOMEN IN THE PROGRAM ROMERO DEPUTY DIRECTOR IF I CAN ON ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWENTY NINE OF THE AGENDA THE PROPOSAL STATES THAT THE PROGRAM WILL IDENTIFY PROGRAM SITES BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING THE REGIONAL CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. SHOULDN'T NEED. DRIVE SELECTION OF PROGRAM SITES RATHER THAN EXISTING CAPACITY. OFTEN LOCATIONS WITH THE LEAST CAPACITY HAVE THE GREATEST NEED- WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THE FIFTEEN SITES THAT YOU MENTIONED AND HOW WE ARE ENSURING THAT IT IS GOING. TOWARDS THE- YES LIKE I STATED THAT WE DO INTEND ON WORK THEY WERE SHOOTING FOR THE FIFTEEN- SITES WE WANT TO SEE SOMEONE WILL AREAS AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT AT FIRST YEAR THAT PLANNING PER YEAR THAT WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY SOME STAND UP. SOME OF THESE- AREAS THAT NEED ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PUT BRING ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIPS AND SO ON SO THAT IS PART OF OUR STRATEGY THAT WE COALESCE AROUND NEED. WILL FINAL COMMENT ON THIS SIDE ONE OF THE STATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED WORKING WITH POPULATIONS THAT- HAVE HISTORY OFTENTIMES MEANS WE NEED TO WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND THEM AND TO ENSURE THAT THEY PARTICIPATE AND ARE WORKING WITH US IN THESE PROGRAMS. I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE- INITIAL- COHORTS THAT CAME OUT OF ALAMEDA AS IT WILL ALLOW US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE SCALE THIS AND GROW THIS GOING FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL SIX WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL SEVEN WHICH IS ON THE H. KAIT WORK FORCE FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED AND WE WILL HAVE A TOTAL OF FOUR PRESENTERS WHO ARE ON THIS PANEL BEGINNING WITH DIRECTOR ELIZABETH LANDSBERG OF H. CHI. MAHDIA LYNN MORRIS WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR VISION AND COME FROM ME SOUL COREY HOW SHE DEALT WITH THE OLEO AND MICHELLE GIVENS WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF. GEAC LET US BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR LANCE BURKE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ELIZABETH LANDSBERG THE DIRECTOR OF H. CAI PRESENTING OUR PORTION OF THE WORKFORCE FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AND SHE LIVED WHICH INCLUDES A BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND AS WELL AS A PORTION OF THE OPIATE OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUNDS. AS WITH ALL OF THESE GUYS WORKFORCE INITIATIVES THESE PROPOSAL SEEK TO INVEST IN TRAINING A DIVERSE HEALTH WORKFORCE. IMPORTANCE OF THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED- APPROPRIATELY AT LENGTH THIS AFTERNOON- WERE ALSO WORKING TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE SHORTAGES IN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND INCREASE ACCESS TO CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY- WITH MEDIC HOW MEMBERS. BECAUSE DOCTOR ARAMBULA IS RIGHTLY PUSHING US TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EVERY PART OF THE STATE I DO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT IT IS A KEY PRIORITY OF ALL OF H. GUYS WORKFORCE PROGRAMS TO SERVE. THOSE TO IDENTIFY THOSE PARTS OF THE STATE OF THE THAT THAT ARE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AND TO FOCUS OUR RESOURCES THERE H. CHRIST SERVES AS THE STATE'S PRIMARY CARE OFFICE AS WELL AS THE STATE OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH. AND IN THAT CAPACITY WE IDENTIFY THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS BOTH IN TERMS OF PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. OUR LOAN REPAYMENT AND SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS REQUIRE A SERVICE OBLIGATION SPECIFICALLY IN A MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA ON A RESIDENCY IN TRAINING PROGRAMS ALSO FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THOSE AREAS THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONTINUE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO. DIVERSIFY THE WORKFORCE AND AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AREA OF THE STATE UNSERVED. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENT THAT WOULD BE AND ADMINISTERED BY H. CHI. FIRST IS THE 20% FOR NURSING INITIATIVE WHICH PROPOSES TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED NURSES LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES. CERTIFIED MEDICAL ASSISTANT FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS- I THINK WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE OF THE SIGNIFICANT NURSING SHORTAGES FACING CALIFORNIA A DEPUTY SECRETARIES NAY TALK ABOUT OME OF THE SPECIFIC DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING. FROM HEALTH FORCE- AND OTHERS ABOUT THE THOSE NURSING SHORTAGES AND WELL H. I. ALREADY HAS PROGRAMS SUPPORTING A VARIETY OF NURSE NURSING PROFESSIONS WE BELIEVE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IS NEEDED TO MEET THE CURRENT NEEDS. UP NEXT ALL TURN TO THE CALIFORNIA SOCIAL WORK TWENTY THIRTY INITIATIVE WHICH PROPOSES TWO HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION TO SUPPORT SOCIAL WORK TRAINING PROGRAMS AS WELL AS PROVIDING STIPENDS AND SCHOLARSHIPS FOR PEOPLE WORKING TO CREATE A NEW PIPELINE. FOR DIVERSE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO CAN'T OTHERWISE AFFORD THE FINANCIAL OR TIME INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE FULL TIME PROGRAMS SO AT AGE I WE'VE WE'VE TRADITIONALLY RELIED A LOT ON LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS ONLY WORK IF YOU HAVE THE CREDIT TO. TO TAKE OUT THOSE LOANS AND I'M AT THE OUTSET SO WE'RE LOOKING A LOT MORE- THAT EXPANDING A SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS AS WELL AS DEVELOPING MORE STATEMENT. THE PROGRAMS WE'RE PLEASED OF THAT SOCIAL WORK PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ASSESSING OPTIONS TO FOR EXAMPLE ACCELERATE A MASTERS IN SOCIAL WORK DEGREE- WE'VE WE'VE HAD SOME PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS I'M WITH. THOSE PROGRAMS AND ARE CONTINUING TO DO SO FOR EXAMPLE TODAY MANY PEOPLE AS SPEND FOUR YEARS GETTING THEIR UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE- MAKE IT MAY GET THROUGH CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AFTER THAT THEN HAVE A TWO YEARS. OF PROGRAM TO GET THEIR MASTERS AND THEN ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SO MANY PEOPLE IT'S TAKING THEM EIGHT YEARS TO BECOME AN LCSW UNTIL WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS OF ACCELERATING THAT- THERE ARE THERE ARE DEVELOPMENT FOUR PLUS ONE. PROGRAM FOR A MASTERS IN SOCIAL WORK DEGREE THAT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING- AS NOTED IN THE IN THE AGENDA IN THAT SOME OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY WE STILL HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT- A LACK OF PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHIATRIC. OF PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA O WE ARE PROPOSING INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION. TO CREATE TRAINING POSITIONS FOR PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS. PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS PSYCHOLOGY INTERNS AND FELLOWS AND PSYCHIATRIC NURSES. INCREASING ON SITE TRAINING PROGRAMS WILL HELP BUILD THE WORKFORCE WHILE ALSO SERVING AS AN ACTIVE RECRUITMENT TOOL FOR ADVANCEMENT WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKFORCE. WITH LEADING WE HOPE TO PROMOTIONAL PATHWAYS AND INCREASED SALARIES SO A DEPUTY DIRECTOR RISE L. TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING SOME OF THE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS INCLUDING- IN PLACES LIKE BUTTE COUNTY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT- SO THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT- LACK OF PSYCHIATRISTS IN IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO. DEVELOP THE OTHER PROFESSIONS LIKE THE PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS. I'M AND THEN WE HAVE A PROPOSAL TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER AN ISSUE OF IN CALIFORNIA. THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO RECREATE RECRUIT TRAIN AND CERTIFY COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND I DO WANT TO GO INTO THIS PROPOSAL- AND A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AS THIS IS A NEW PROFESSION THAT H. I WOULD BE SUPPORTING. THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND PROMOTE TORRES PROVIDING CULTURALLY CONGRESS PERSON CENTERED SERVICES AND IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AS IT'S BEEN NOTED A COVERT NINETEEN HAS SHOWN AN EVEN THE SERVICES. AND ON HEALTH DISPARITIES IN CALIFORNIA- JUST CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE TRUSTED- AMBASSADORS TOOK TO OUR COMMUNITY IS TO HELP WITH THESE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS SEEKING FEDERAL APPROVAL TO USE MEDICAID FUNDS TO SUPPORT SERVICES PROVIDED BY COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND FROM A TORTOISE. AND H. CHI'S BUILDING ON DHS'S CONSIDERABLE WORK SO WE APPRECIATE ALL THE- WONDERFUL WORK THEY'VE DONE THEM BOTH WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOKING AT OTHER STATES- ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. SO H. HIGHS RELATIVELY NEW AGAIN TO THIS AREA BUT WE HAVE ENGAGED- OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL ROLE THE STATE CAN PLAY IN SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDIZED CURRICULA AND TRAINING COMPONENTS AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE. SO IN THIS ENGAGEMENT WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO ACKNOWLEDGING THE VALUE OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE. I ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK THAT WILL PROVIDE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS A PATHWAY TO OBTAIN A CERTIFICATE THROUGH A STATE APPROVED PROGRAM. WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO EMPOWERING AND SUPPORTING EXISTING TRAINING PROGRAMS BY AUTHORIZING THOSE PROGRAMS TO GRANT CERTIFICATES THAT VERIFY A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER HAS UNDERGONE TRAINING THAT MEETS. THE FORTHCOMING STANDARDS- THAT WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER STAKEHOLDERS. WE WANT TO WITH. THE TRAINING AND CURRICULA STANDARDS THAT WILL PROVIDE EMPLOYERS OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS A CLEAR UNDERSTOOD ANY OF THEIR ABILITY THE FIELD AND VALUE. AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HORIZONTAL AN UPWARD CAREER MBILITY. HEALTH WORKERS. WE'RE PLEASED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND VALUE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WITH DIVERSE LIVED EXPERIENCE AND THOSE WITH THE VERSE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC BACKGROUNDS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF- TRYING TO FINALIZE OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CREATE A CERTIFICATE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING GAUGE MEANT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER STAKEHOLDERS. INCLUDING TRAINING ENTITIES EMPLOYERS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. UNDER THE FORTHCOMING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE WOULD CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS TO ESTABLISH CORE COMPETENCIES FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING STANDARDS. WE EXPECT THAT HAVEN'T A NUMBER OF SPECIALIZATIONS INCLUDING CLIMATE HEALTH HOMELESSNESS DEMENTIA. AND OTHER SPECIALIZED AREAS OF NEED. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING DH CS THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALL OF WHOM HAVE DONE VERY IMPORTANT WORK IN THINKING ABOUT THIS TO ENSURE A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER TRAINING STANDARDS MEET THEIR PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS. SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE WORKING ON THIS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER INITIATIVE AND BELIEVE IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES. I'M OKAY SO MOVING ON AND ALSO A FOUNDATIONAL TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES AS IS INCREASING OUR LINGUISTIC CAPACITY- WITH THE HEALTH WORKFORCE SO WE ARE PROPOSING SIXTY MILLION GENERAL FUND- IN A MULTI LINGUAL HEALTH INITIATIVE TO EXPAND SPECIFICALLY SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS IN HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL WORK- SPECIFICALLY FOR MULTI LINGUAL APPLICANTS. WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL COMPETENCIES THROUGHOUT THE CARE WORK FORCE. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT ALL OF H. GUYS WORKFORCE PROGRAM SEEK TO INCREASE RACIAL AND LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY BUT THESE FUNDS WOULD BE FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MULTI LINGUAL PROVIDERS ARE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE. FOLKS THIS FUNDS TO DO THAT. I AM THE PROPOSAL TO USE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF THE OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUNDS- FOR OPIOID PROVIDER TRAINING IN SUPPORT OF EMPLOYMENT. OF THAT AMOUNT A TWENTY TWO MILLION WOULD BE USED FOR OPIOID PROVIDER TRAINING TO PROVIDE GRANT FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY BASED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROVIDERS. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LICENSED CLINICIANS AS WELL AS NON LICENSE SIDE WORKFORCE WITH A FOCUS ON OPIOID TREATMENTS. AND THEN THAT OF THE LAST FOUR MILLION WITH SUPPORT A PILOT PROJECT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OF EMPLOYMENT FOR THOSE IN RECOVERY FROM SIDE. TO TRANSITION THEM- INTO ONGOING EMPLOYMENT. SO AS NOTED BY ASSISTANT SECRETARY DELGADO AND DEPUTY SECRETARIES NAY SOME OF THE SPECIFIC SEVENTH PROPOSALS ARE STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT BASED ON OUR CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT WITH THE DATA. AND WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IT'S REALLY BEEN A WONDERFUL TO BE PART OF THIS ENGAGEMENT. OF BRINGING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND L. W. D. A. TOGETHER TO WHICH IT TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER TO TRY TO DO THE-% THAT TO HAVE THESE IMPORTANT WORKFORCE. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS MOVE FORWARD AND. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MONEY ALLOW MOST WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE PC ON ECONOMY SO PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I DON'T ALTURAS ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOCTOR JOAQUIN ARAMBULA AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WENDY CARILLO MEMBERS OF SUBCOMMITTEES ONE AND FOUR. AND I FIRST- TO START MY TESTIMONY BY THINKING YOUR STAFF FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE HERE TODAY. I LIVE IN TWO THOUSAND THE SENATE COMPROMISSO IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH AND WELLBEING BY SUPPORTING FROM THE BONUS WE ARE A PIONEER AND INNOVATOR IN THE MOVEMENT FOR AN UPDATE OF A THOUGHT AS- WE CURRENTLY EMPLOY OVER TWO HUNDRED AND WITH ORDERS AND OUR NETWORK OF BUT WITH THE RECENT CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS OVER FOUR THOUSAND FROM THE VOTING SCREENING HEALTH WORKERS. AND OTHER COMMUNITY LEADERS. WELL WE ARE IN STRONG OF THE BUDGET. ALLOCATE FROM HER AND FIFTY MILLION TO RECRUIT TRAIN AND CERTIFY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDS SHOULD BE ALLOCATED. TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THREE CRITICAL FACTORS WHICH I WILL SPEAK TO. FIRST IT IS ESSENTIAL BACK ON SPEAKING ABOUT COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WE EXPLICITLY INCLUDE PROSTHETICS. SECOND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS MUST ALSO MEET THE PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL NEEDS OF ROAD BUT IT'S AN THIRD COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH A LONG HISTORY OF RECRUITING TRAINING AND OVERSEEING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD BE RESOURCE. AND HAVE A KEY ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING THE SIGNATURE OF DISCUSSING WHY BUT ALL OF THOSE SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED AS DISTINCT MEMBERS OF THE LARGER. MEANING HEALTH WORKER FIELD. BUT I'M ABOUT AS ARE PRIMARILY WOMEN WHO ARE TRUSTED. AND RESPECTED COMMUNITY LEADERS COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO PROVIDE SEVENTY SO THE KHORASAN SERVICE FROM THE HEART. THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF THEIR WORK THEIR LOCAL EXPERTS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSERVED AND UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES. I DON'T THOSE ARE OFTEN LOW INCOME MEMBERS OF DIVERSE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THANK SHARON UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES OF NAVIGATING AND ACCESSING ESSENTIAL RESOURCES. SUMMER MONOLINGUAL UNDEREMPLOYED WITHOUT DIPLOMAS OR DEGREES MANY WERE RAISED WITH GENERATIONS OF FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE THE ONES THAT OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY TURN TO FOR INFORMATION AND SUPPORT. AS WAS MY MOTHER AND MY GRANDMOTHER. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT IN THE NATION WIDE MOVE TO A MORE PROFESSIONAL LIVES TO COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER ROLE. SACRAMENTO HAS NOT BE SUBSUMED INTO A MEDICAL MODEL ARE CENTERED AND SUPPORTED IN THEIR COMMUNITY WHERE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO BE A CONDO TO THE CLINICS HOSPITALS AND OTHER PLACES. THE COMMUNITY GETS CARE PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL MEANS THE PROPONENTS. OF THE REST MUST BE ENGAGED IN IDENTIFYING CORE COMPETENCIES FOR ANY TRAINING PROGRAM. THIS WILL CREATE PROGRAMSTHAT ARE FROM OTHER CENTERS BONTA DEFINED AND MORE LIKELY REFLECTIVE OF COMMUNITY NEEDS. BERMAN THOUGHT AS A MISSING BILLS ARE REPRESENTING INVOLVED ARE INVOLVED IN CREATING ANY RECRUITMENT TRAINING. AND CREDENTIALING PROGRAM THIS WILL HELP INSURE THAT PROPONENTS AND MAKING THEIR UNIQUE ROLES ARE REPRESENTED FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY. THIS WILL SET THE FOUNDATION TO HIRE COME COMMUNITY EXPERTISE AND OFFER A LIVING WAGE. AND FINALLY. WE BELIEVE THAT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE A LONG HISTORY. AND EXPERIENCE IN RECRUITMENT TRAINING AND OVERSEEING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND PROPONENTS SHOULD BE INTEGRATED AT THE BEGINNING. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION ESTABLISH A FORMAL STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THIS WORKFORCE INITIATIVE. COMPOSED OF 51% COMMUNITY EALTH WORKERS AND FROM WITHOUT IT'S RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE CBO'S BENEFICIARIES AND COMMUNITY EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO ENSURING THAT COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND FROM THE PHOTOS. HAVE DECISION MAKING POWERS AND LEADERSHIP. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE NAME HOLLOW DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND ELIGIBILITY. WHICH HAS ENGAGE WITHCBO'S OVER THE LAST YEAR FOLLOWING ESTABLISHED ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AS IT HAS DRAFTED THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW TWENTY FOUR COULD BENEFIT. THE FEEDBACK PRINCIPIOS HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING THE SPA IS INCLUSIVE OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND PRODUCT BUT IT'S NEEDS. ALTHOUGH SOME CONCERNS REMAIN WE TRUST WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TOWARDS RESOLUTION. THIS NEW RECRUIT TRAINING AND CREDENTIALING PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES. BY ENSURING THAT IT WAS BUILT WITH AND FOR BERMAN BUDGETS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I CAN PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE VALUE ANY SUPPORT AMONG VOTERS CENTRAL TO THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAMS WHICH IS A MASSIVE. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM COREY HOW SHE DEALT WITH THE HELLO. THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULATORY KOREA SHEET WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAD PUBLISHED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNORS CARE ECONOMY PACKAGE LAST WEEK- WHICH H. GUYS MAJOR WORKFORCE FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA OR ALL B. C. P. R. WHICH HAVE THE COMMENTS REYES- FIRST WE FIND THAT- PROPOSED PACKAGE OF AUGMENTATIONS IS LARGELY CONCEPTUAL WITH SOME INFORMATION NOT YET DEVELOPED- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE FOR SEVERAL OF THE PROPOSALS THE ULTIMATE SET. OF SPECIFIC PROVIDER TYPES THAT WILL BE TARGETED WITH THIS FUNDING IS UNCLEAR- FOR EXAMPLE THE- KAGE INCLUDES FUNDING TO. SUPPORT PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCIES AS WELL AS OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS- BUT A SPECIFIC BREAKDOWN OF WHAT. SHARE WILL GO FOR EACH PETER HEALTH PROVIDER TYPE IS NOT NOT NOT READILY AVAILABLE- AND WE ALSO FIND THAT THE PROPOSED- THE LACK OF THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL TO IMPLEMENT MOST OF THE PROPOSED FUNDING. LIMITS THE LEGISLATURE'S INPUT ON THE DESIGN OF THESE WORK FOR STOPPING AUGMENTATIONS- SECOND. ALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE OF WORKFORCE SHORTAGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE YEAH WE FIND THAT THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE WOULD. BENEFIT FROM A MORE REFINED PROBLEM DEFINITION- OF WHICH WE SUPPORT OUTLINING THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS WITH IDENTIFIED CAUSES FOR WORKFORCE SHORTAGES- YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF. STATE WHITE STREET STATEWIDE WORKFORCE NEEDS ACROSS PROVIDER TYPES WHICH WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTAND JUST HOW COSE THIS INVESTMENT WOULD GET THE STATE TO MEETING THE TARGET NUMBER OF UP NEEDED PROVIDERS- OR WHETHER THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE SET OF PROVIDERS TO TARGET OR OF ANY. PROVIDER TYPES ARE ARE MISSING FROM THE PROPOSED PACKAGE- IT ALSO DOES NOT BY NECESSITY OF SORT OF WHY THESE GAPS ARE OCCURRING- YOU KNOW THE INTERVENTIONS IN THE PROPOSED PACKAGE TARGET EDUCATION AND TRAINING- BUT WORK FOR SORT SHORTAGES COULD BE OCCURRING FOR OTHER REASONS SUCH AS- WORKING CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND- AND SO. YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TAKE SOME TIME TO MATERIALIZE- WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATE WORK FORCE SHORTAGES IS UNCLEAR IN OUR VIEW- YOU KNOW WE ALSO FIND THAT HOW THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE WOULD COMPLEMENT PRIOR. STATE WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS IS ALSO UNCLEAR- FOR EXAMPLE. THIS STATE IS UNDER WAY ON ADMINISTERING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE FUNDING TARGETED TARGETED AT CHILDREN AND YOUTH UNDER THE- THE UMBRELLA OF THE CHILDREN USE. THE EITHER A HEALTH INITIATIVE- THESE OTHER INVESTMENTS YOU KNOW SHOULD ALSO RESULT IN NEW PROVIDERS IN THE FUTURE AND SO HOW THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE WHAT SORT OF BUILT ON. THESE EFFORTS- INCLUDING WHEN IT COMES TO EVALUATION OF RESULTS- AND NOT SORT OF DUPLICATE EFFORTS IS UNCLEAR- GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS HERE WE RECOMMEND A COUPLE OF POSSIBLE APPROACHES- FIRST YOU KNOW WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DEFER ACTION ON FUNDING FOR THIS PACKAGE UNTIL. A FULLY FLESHED OUT PLAN IS DEVELOPED- YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE PLANNING FUNDS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERTAKE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE UNDERLYING CAUSES FOR THESE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES ARE- AND WITH THE PROPER INTERVENTIONS ARE TO ADDRESS THESE CAUSES. AND THEN AND THEN EVALUATE PROVIDING FULL FUNDING FOR A FLESHED OUT PLAN FROM THE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION NEXT YEAR- HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES APPROVE OF THIS PACKAGING CONCEPT AND WISHES TO PROVIDE FUNDING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IT ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE. SOME FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE ON THE PACKAGE AT ME REVISION- THIS INFORMATION COULD INCLUDE YOU KNOW- SPECIFICS BEHIND YOU KNOW HOW FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED ACROSS SPECIFIC PROVIDER TYPES OR- HOW MANY ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS BY PROVIDER TYPE ARE NEEDED TO MEET SORT OF STATEWIDE NEED- THIS WOULD SORT OF HELP THE LEGISLATURE- YOU ASSESS THE MERITS OF THE PACKAGE OUT IN TIME FOR SORT OF THE BUDGET PROCESS TO. TO PLAY OUT- WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND ADOPTING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ENSURE LEGISLATIVE INPUT INTO KEY DETAILS OF THIS THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE OF AUGMENTATIONS- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER. PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM. GIBBONS IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON TWO CHAIRS MEMBERS OF MICHELLE GIVENS WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE A FIRST WE WANT TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR PROPOSALS TO INVEST IN HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES WORKFORCE. I WANT TO THANK THE SUBCOMMITTEE HOWEVER FOR EXPANDING THE DISCUSSION TO INCLUDE THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE SIMILAR HEALTHCARE PUBLIC HEALTH RELIES ON SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKERS AND THAT INCLUDES- BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO PHYSICIANS MEDICAL DIRECTORS EPIDEMIOLOGISTS DISEASE INVESTIGATORS AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE FACED SIGNIFICANT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CHALLENGES MANY WHICH EXISTS EXISTED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- AND APRIL TWENTY TWENTY TRUST FOR AMERICA'S HEALTH REPORT NOTED BURN OUT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND WAS GROWING AS THEY HAD CONSISTENTLY BEEN ASKED TO DO MORE WITH LESS RESOURCES. THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTED- ALSO HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE INTERESTED NEEDS ASSESSMENT SURVEY THAT FOUND THAT GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE FACES MAJOR CHALLENGES AND TURNOVER AND ATTRITION. SIMILARLY THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE OF HEALTHCARE IS WORKFORCE COMMISSION- IN THEIR FEBRUARY NINETEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT. LISTED PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH IS ONE OF THE PRIORITY PROFESSIONS INDICATING THAT THE DEMAND FOR NEW LEADERS WILL INCREASE RAPIDLY IN THE COMING YEARS AS A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF CURRENT LEADERS WERE SLATED FOR RETIREMENT. AND THAT MANY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAD ALREADY REPORTED CHALLENGES IN RECRUITING AND RETAINING WELL QUALIFIED WORKERS CITING A LACK OF TOOLS FOR RECRUITING AND LIMITED OPTIONS FOR ADVANCEMENT AND INSTABILITY OF FUNDED POSITIONS. ARE HEADLINE CHALLENGES ARE REFLECTED IN AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. DECIDED ONLY 17% OF GRADUATES FROM SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN I'M TO WORKING GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH. COMPARE THAT WITH THE 27% THAT WENT TO WORK IN THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE TWENTY FOUR PERCENT- THAT WENT TO CORPORATIONS AND EVEN 19% THAT WENT TO ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. IN CALIFORNIA LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FACE INCREASING COMPETITION WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH PROVIDES HIGHER PAY SIGN ON BONUSES LONGER PAYMENT OPTIONS AND AMENITIES SUCH AS UPDATED TECHNOLOGY. UNFORTUNATELY DURING THE PANDEMIC OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE FACED HARASSMENT AND THREATS WHICH RESULTED IN LEADERSHIP TO PARK DEPARTURES EXCUSE ME. THE NATION'S HEALTH A PUBLICATION OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION NOTED THAT THIS NOT ONLY ENDANGERS THE SAFETY AND MENTAL WELL BEING OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS. BUT IT COULD ALSO MAKE IT HARDER TO RECRUIT NEW WORKERS INTO GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WELL THESE WORKFORCE CHALLENGES EXIST FOR ALL LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IT'S EVEN MORE DIRE FOR ROLE IN CENTRAL VALLEY JURISDICTIONS. AND DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA DOES NOT YET HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO BOLSTER THE WORKFORCE PIPELINE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE MUST CHANGE THAT. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT- PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINES. THE PRIORITIZING THINGS LIKE FLEXIBLE INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT RECRUITMENT OF NEW PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS. AT AND DIVERSE WORKERS AT THAT AND THE RETENTION OF OUR EXISTING STAFF- WITH THE SET ASIDE FOR RURAL AND CENTRAL VALLEY JURISDICTIONS. ALSO THINKING ABOUT I'M SUPPORTING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF TO SUPPORT CAREER ADVANCEMENT. WE'RE BLESSED AT PROGRAMS AND TRAINING THAT WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE MICROBIOLOGIST LAB DIRECTORS AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST- PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARGETED TO EARLY CAREER PROFESSIONALS. THAT TARGET DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS THAT LIVING COMMUNITIES AND INTERNSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE CS USING UC'S. AND ELIMINATING COST BARRIERS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES I HEARD DIRECTOR LANDSBERG MENTIONED- THE NURSE SHORTAGE AND IN PUBLIC HEALTH WE HAVE NURSES THAT. ARE REGISTERED NURSES BUT THEN THEY GO ON AND PAY AN ADDITIONAL FEE TO RECEIVE AND MAINTAIN A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE CERTIFICATION SO IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. FOR PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES. THE PANDEMIC SHINE A LIGHT ON THE CRITICAL ROLE OF OUR OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN OUR WORKFORCE AND WE JUST ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER. A VERY AS YOU'RE CONSIDERING EXCUSE ME VARIOUS WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE ALSO BE PRIORITIZED IN A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS DISCUSSION TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS AND KEEP IT WITH THE CHAIR RIGHT NOW- I'M GONNA FOCUS ON PAGE THIRTY TWO OF THE AGENDA AND ALMOST GO SEQUENTIALLY THROUGH THE PROPER POSTAL'S TASK. I'M GONNA BEGIN WE AGE BECAUSE I ON THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS PROPOSAL. I'D FIRST LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW DID WE DECIDE ON TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS HAS A NICE RING BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. BUT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THIS CURRENT ROUND OF FUNDING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO GET US TO THAT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WILL IT REQUIRE FUTURE YEAR INVESTMENTS FOR US TO GET TO THAT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THANK YOU DR REHM REALISTICALLY IN TERMS OF. WHY WE WEAR WHY WE SETTLED ON THAT AMOUNT I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY TRYING TO BE BOLD AND MEET THIS MOMENT- I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT THE L. A- THAT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED BUT WE- THINK THERE'S A VERY UNIQUE MOMENT IN TIME RIGHT NOW- WHERE FOLKS ARE WRECKED OUR OUR RECOGNIZING HEALTH DISPARITIES. WHERE MEDIC CALLOUS TRYING TO GET COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS- CERTIFIED- THEY'VE TRYING TO GET REIMBURSEMENT FOR THEM SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY BE BOWLS- WILL HOLD WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK THERE'S A HUGE UNMET NEEDS- FOR THESE CULTURAL LINGUISTIC AMBASSADORS. TO OUR COMMUNITY. HOPING YOU COULD DO AGAIN WITH THE MONEY ALUMNUS HAD SAID ABOUT THE NEED FOR SUSTAINABILITY THAT CBO SHOULD BE. RESOURCE AND WANTS TO. COMBINE THE NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER SERVICE BENEFIT THAT WILL BE COMING OUT AS WELL WILL THAT HELP US TO CREATE THAT SUSTAINABILITY OR- HOW DO YOU ENVISION BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE CBO'S- WHO WILL BE EMPLOYING THOSE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. WE DO HOPE THAT THE THAT THE NEW BENEFIT WILL HEALTH- WITHIN SUSTAINABILITY PEAS AND ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT EACH EACH CBO NEEDS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER AND FROM WHAT I HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO WORK WITHIN THAT SYSTEM OR NOT SO I THINK OUR GOAL. IS TO CREATE A STRUCTURE- FOR THOSE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND FROM A TAURUS YOU CHOOSE TO CHOOSE TO GET THIS NEW CERTIFICATE NOT TO MANDATE THAT ANYONE DOES SO- AND WE DO THINK THAT MEDIC CAL WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT FUNDING SOURCE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I DON'T MAKE TO FUND. PLEASE DO- I THINK THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION ABOUT THE- THE MEDICAL TOUCH MENTOR THEM UP TO THE FUNDS ALSO FOR THOSE THAT ARE THAT HOW ABOUT OUR MANY CAL PROVIDERS IT THE MONEY AND THE ELIGIBILITY IS NOT FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE WHICH IS THE COMMITTEE FROM OTHER PEACE. AND SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A CUT OUT TO GO BACK AND THIS IS I THINK WEBER NAY AND DID SHE HAS TO DO WITH FOR THIS PHAM AND THAT WAS INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THE CBO'S COULD RECEIVE FUNDS DIRECTLY TO SUPPORT THE HIRING OF. THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY AS OPPOSED TO THEM HAVING TO BE ASSIGNED OR WORK FOR A MEDICAL PROVIDER. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WILL FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAILS I WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE COMPREHENSIVE NURSING INITIATIVE- THE FIRST I WOULD APPRECIATE A BIT MORE DETAIL- ON THIS PART OF THE PROPOSAL HAPPY FOR THAT. TO HAPPEN OFFLINE. BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE MORE INVOLVED WITHTHE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION IF POSSIBLE ON THIS PRO ON THIS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY. BUT I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE TWENTY PROGRAM GRANTS THAT WERE LISTED AGAIN I'M GONNA BEAT THAT DRUM. HOW ARE WE DECIDING THOSE LOCATIONS AND REGIONS ARE WE FOCUSING ON THE IMPACT AND PROGRAMS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH I'M NOT SURE WHICH TWENTY PROGRAMS YOU'RE REFERRING TO AN ALL ASK KAREN REYES L. TO JUMP IN IF SHE'S MORE FAMILIAR. SENATOR AREN'T OUR NURSING PROGRAM IT IS A IS PROPOSED NEW WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT EXISTING SONG BROWN SUPPORT FOR OUR AND PROGRAMS ON PAGE THIRTY TWO OF THE AGENDA UNDER THE NURSING INITIATIVE AND STATED THAT THERE WILL BE TWENTY. TRAINING PROGRAM GRANTS FOR NURSES AND OTHER YES SECTIONALS AND- THAT'S THE COMMENT I WAS ASKING ABOUT. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA SO YES WE DID DO- WE DID DO THE BUDGETING TO ADD TO DETERMINE WHAT. YOU KNOW YOU WILL HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND RIGHTLY SO ASKING US WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR OUR DOLLARS SO- THEY THIS IS DATA THAT THAT H. CAI PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE TO SPELL OUT- WHAT THESE DOLLARS. COULD SUPPORT. I WILL THEN MOVE ON TO THE SOCIAL WORKERS AND APOLOGIZE IF THE QUESTIONS ARE HARSH I AM JUST TRYING TO. ASK QUESTIONS AS I BELIEVE THEY NEED TO BE ASKED. BUT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND YOUR REASONING FOR- PROPOSING RESOURCES FOR OVER FORTY FIVE HUNDRED LOAN REPAYMENTS. FOR OUR NURSES AND YET ONLY FUNDING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY LOAN REPAYMENTS FOR OUR SOCIAL WORKERS. HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THE SCALE AND DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THOSE TWO PROPOSALS. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY STILL LOOKING AT DARK ARAMBULA AND SO I THINK WE DO NEED TO DIG INTO THE DATA A LITTLE BIT MORE AND WE DO FIND THAT THAT. NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED- SO I CERTAINLY HEAR YOUR POINT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD ON THAT. NOPE AND WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO. HAPPY TO LOOK AT DR RAM VILAS. I THINK- YOU KNOW. YET YEAH THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT THE- BUT I WILL- I APPRECIATED ALL THE COMMENTARY THUS FAR ON PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCIES- I WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE A FOCUS ON CHILD PSYCHIATRY EXPLICITLY. AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IN THIS PROPOSAL IS FOCUSING ON CHILD PSYCHIATRY AND HOPING THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE COMMENT. WELL ACTUALLY- OUR CURRENT AND ELIA REFERRED TO THIS CURRENTLY WERE OR IMPLEMENTING THE CHILD AND YOU'VE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE WHICH DOES INCLUDE DOLLARS FOR PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM SUPPORT AND SO THERE WAS WE WILL CERTAINLY- HAVE A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON. PROGRAMS THAT THAT THAT OUR TRAINING CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS- AND THIS IS MORE OPEN BUT BUT CERTAINLY KNOWLEDGE THAT THE IMPORTANT I NEED THEIR- I'D LIKE TO NOW TRANSITION TO THE OPIOD. RESPONSE INITIATIVES AND- GIVEN THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF AN OPIOID AND SPECIFICALLY A FENTANYL OVERDOSE CRISIS RIGHT NOW I'M BOTH VERY PLEASED AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR PROVIDER TRAINING HOWEVER GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE CRISIS THAT WE ARE FACING IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE NEED MORE RESOURCES THAN TWENTY TWO MILLION. IT MAY WELL BE AND I DO WANT TO KNOW THIS IS THIS IS ONLY ONE PIECE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEY WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT HOW THE- HELL THAT ADDITIONAL OF. SETTLEMENT DOLLARS ARE BEING USED I WOULD KNOW THAT UNDER THE CHILDREN pINITIATIVES WE HAVE A LITTLE DOLLARS FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AND ARE HIGHLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT- SO MANY FOLKS ARE STARTING- THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AT AT A YOUNG AGE- AS TEENAGERS THAT THAT'S REALLY XCELERATED. WITH OVERDOSES AMONG MANY PEOPLE THEIR YOUNG TWENTIES SO JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO THE YOUTH INITIATIVE SAID SELLERS AS WELL- IN THIS AREA. RECOGNIZING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION IS NOT HERE ON THIS PANEL WITH REGARDS TO THE VOCATIONAL. REHABILITATION COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL ON PAGE THIRTY THREE. THE PROPOSAL STATES THAT THE PILOT WILL TRAIN THE OPIOID PROVIDER WORK FORCE ON HOW TO INCLUDE. EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AS PART OF PARTICIPATION IN THE TREATMENT. DO WE INCLUDE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. OR IN OTHER SUBSTANCE ABUSE NOT JUST OPIOID TREATMENT. IF NOT WHY NOT AND WOULD THAT NOT BE BENEFICIAL. I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT THAT ANYONE WHO'S- RECOVERING FROM OF SAYS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER NEED SUPPORT IN MANY AREAS OF THEIR LIFE INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. FINAL QUESTION I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT MICHELLE GIBBONS- STATED. IN ASKING WHY WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED OR INVOLVED PUBLIC HEALTH THUS FAR. AS I'M QUITE SENSITIVE TO MANY OF THE PIPELINE CHALLENGES THAT THEY ARE STATING AS WELL AS- THE TURNOVER AND ATTRITION THAT'S OCCURRED TO THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. THAT I WANNA MAKE SURE WERE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO RECRUIT MORE INTO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I'M HOPEFUL TO ENGAGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONVERSATIONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE ABLE TO BUDGET AND RESOURCE FOR THAT AS WELL. HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFFLINE BUT- MAYBE I JUST WILL ASK WHY WASN'T PUBLIC HEALTH INVOLVED IN THIS CARICOM IN WORKFORCE PROPOSAL. OKAY WELL OF COURSE ACT ARAMBULA I'M NOT ABLE TO SPEAK THE PUBLIC HEALTH- BUDGET I WOULD NOTE- AS MICHELLE GIVE INSTEAD THAT A NUMBER OF THE- PROFESSIONS THAT WERE LOOKING TO SUPPORT SUCH AS NURSES. ARE INCLUDED IN PUBLIC HEALTH H. CHI- TRADITIONALLY HAS FOCUSED ON PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND DENTAL CARE SO WE DO NOT HAVE PROGRAMS FOR MICROBIOLOGISTS EPIDEMIOLOGISTS VERY IMPORTANT WORK- IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS WANTING TO JUMP IN. YOUR OPINION CATHARINE CLARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. JUST NOTING THAT ARE. IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED MILLION PROGRAMS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND WORKFORCE. I STILLWANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ASPECT OF THE BUDGET THANK YOU I WOULD LIKE TO THEN FOLLOW UP MY UNDERSTANDING IS TWO HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT IS GOING TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO HELP US WITH. CURRENT STAFF. BUT THAT ISN'T HELPING US TO RECRUIT AND CREATE A PIPELINE FOR. FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH- EMPLOYEES AND- OR MAYBE I SHOULD ASK FINANCES ANY OF THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION HELPFUL FOR US TO RECRUIT OR TO CREATE A PIPELINE OR IS THAT SOLELY FOR CURRENT EMPLOYEES. SHARE ARAMBULA THIS IS MICHELLE GIBBONS AB WHEN YOU GET A MOMENT I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT AS WELL. LET'S BEGIN WITH YOU AS FINANCE APPEARS TO BE HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. SURE SO AS YOU HAD MENTIONED- LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE GETTING TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING HOWEVER THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AROUND RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGIES THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON EXPANDING OUR WORKFORCE CAPACITY SO AS YOU KNOW AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WE WERE WOEFULLY UNDERSTAFFED THOSE THOSE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS REALLY TO SUPPORT ADDING STAFF TO OUR DEPARTMENTS. BUT WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE IS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED SUPPORTS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THEM AND ALSO TO TRAIN THEM AT LEAST THE NEW HAN SAID OF STAFF WE HAVE A LOT OF TRAINING TO DO AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AND TO REALLY FORGE A PATH EVEN WITH EACH GUY. TO CREATE AND SUSTAIN A WORKFORCE PIPELINE THANK YOU. WITH THAT I WOULD. LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL SEVEN WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL EIGHT. ON THE EXCISE TAX ON ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. WE WILL HAVE ONE PRESENTER ON THIS PANEL MOLD. JEREMY MARYON DEPUTY DIRECTOR. OF THE CAL MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE DIVISION AT AGE KILEY CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON HI I'M JP MILLION DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF EACH SIDE'S CAL MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND SENATE BILL SENATE PASSED SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE CREATES AN EXCISE TAX ON ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES OF TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT ON THE SALES PRICE.

TIES HEALTH PROFESSIONS CAREER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM AND 10% WILL GO TO A NEW PROGRAM TO BE DEVELOPED WITHIN H. GUY. CALLED THE SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITAL RELIEF PROGRAM. REGARDING THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS CAREER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM H. K. MINISTERS PROGRAMS FOR BUILDING A DIVIDER DIVERSE PROVIDER WORKFORCE. SUCH AS A HEALTH CAREER EXPLORATION PROGRAM AND PIPELINE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC ENRICHMENT CAREER DEVELOPMENT MENTORSHIP AND ADVISING TO SUPPORT STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED REGIONS AND BACKGROUNDS. TO PURSUE HEALTH CAREERS. H. KABALI USE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THESE FUNDS GOING INTO THIS PROGRAM FROM S. B. THREE NINETY FIVE CAN BE ABSORBED WITH EXISTING STAFF. THE NEW SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITAL RELIEF PROGRAM WILL AWARD FINANCIAL GRANTS TO SMALL RURAL AND CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS THAT NEED TO PERFORM SEISMIC UPGRADES WITHIN THEIR FACILITIES TO ACHIEVE SEISMIC COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAW REQUIRING GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS TO COMPLY WITH SPECIFIC SIZE MADE STATEMENTS SEISMIC SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY THIRTY. THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL REQUESTS FOR POSITIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ONE TIME CONTRACT FUNDING TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. NOW KAREN RIGHTS AL WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS CAREER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. YES SO I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW AND PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT AUGMENTATION PROGRAM EXPANSION FOR THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS CAREERS OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM. SO IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB THREE NINETY FIVE H. I RECEIVED SIXTEEN MILLION ONGOING FUNDING BUILD HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINE PROGRAMS UNDER THAT. RUSSIAN CAREER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM PORTFOLIO WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A NEW PIPELINE PROGRAM THAT WILL FOCUS ON PROVIDING A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES JUSTICE FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS TO SUCCESSFULLY PERFECT PURSUE HEALTH CAREER EDUCATION HEALTHCARE CAREERS EXPECTED OPEN THE SPENDING CYCLE IN MID TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE ALSO ON MEDICARE HEALTH CAREER EXPLORATION PROGRAM FORMERLY MANY GRANTS PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CURRENT EXPLORATION GRANTS. A RECENT APPLICATION CYCLE DOES CLOSE THEN WE RECEIVED THIRTY SIX APPLICATIONS FOR REVIEW. AND FINALLY IN THE BUDGET ACT WE RECEIVED IN POINT FIVE MILLION TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SCHOLARS PROGRAM. THIS GRANT AGREEMENT EXECUTION IS IN ITS FINAL STAGES AND SO THAT PROGRAM WILL BEGIN OPERATING THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR QUESTIONS I'M- IT IT SHOULD BE PRETTY OBVIOUS I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE HEALTH PROFESSION CAREER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. BUT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP AND UNDERSTAND YOU SAID IT WAS OPENING IN MID TWENTY TWENTY TWO SINCE IT WAS BUDGET DIDN'T LAST YEAR'S. BUDGET WHAT'S GOING TO OCCUR THAT FUNDING IS IT GOING TO START IN MID OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WHEN YOU GET ANOTHER ROUND OF FUNDING- AS YOU STATED IT WAS ONGOING AT. MIDDLE OF JUNE- HOW ARE WE GOING TO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE. BEING EFFECTIVELY SPENT AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH LAST YEAR'S. BUDGET ALLOCATION. I'M GOOD QUESTION SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN SPENDING TIME DOING IS DEVELOPING THAT PROGRAM WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MEET WITH- OTHERS AND LEARN ABOUT WHAT ELEMENTS WE NEED TO INCLUDE IN THE PROGRAM SO I'VE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING AND- KIND OF DEVELOPING WHAT THE FRAMEWORK WITH THIS PROGRAM WOULD INCLUDE- TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE- TRYING TO. DEVELOP AS ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE OF A PIPELINE PROGRAM- THAT ORGANIZATIONS COULD PARTICIPATE IN SO WE'VE BEEN DOING FROM OUR PLANNING AND- DESIGN WORK- IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE 5% OF REVENUE WILL NOT BE SUPPLANTING. ANY OF THE CURRENT SIXTEEN MILLION HONG GOING THAT WE HAVE AN REVENUE AND INSTEAD WILL BE GOING TO HELP TO SCALE THE PROGRAM AND HOPING YOU CAN CLARIFY THAT. EXACTLY THAT'S THE PURPOSE IS THAT THIS WILL BE ABLE TO AUGMENT FACT FINDING AND BUILD A STRONGER PIPELINE PROGRAM. I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT WE'RE ALSO WITH SOME WITH CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE DOLLARS- YOU KNOW THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE WANT TO BUILD A PIPELINE THAT SUPPORTS PRIMARY CARE OF SPORTS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORTS ALLIED HEALTH. I'M SORT OF REALLY THAT THIS KIND OF SPENDING IS BASED FUNDING AND THEN WE'RE ABLE TO ADD ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO IT TO BUILD A PROGRAM THAT REACHES MORE STUDENTS. I'D LIKE TO TRANSITION NOW TO ON PAGE THIRTY SIX OF OUR AGENDA WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THE HOSPITAL. SEISMIC RELIEF PROGRAM. I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH REVENUE THE STATE EXPECTS THE TAX WILL GENERATE BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND WHAT ARE THE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR US TO UPGRADE THE REMAINING TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE HOSPITAL BUILDINGS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE AGENDA. IN OTHER WORDS IS THERE A LARGE GAP IN FUNDING. THAT'S NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF CALIFORNIA SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS WILL BE SEISMICALLY COMPLIANT. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING. HOW DO WE PRIORITIZE THE LIMITED FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE IT'S- REGARDING THE- HOW MUCH REVENUE IS GOING TO BE HEADED TO THE- TO THE SMALL RURAL HOSPITAL RELIEF PROGRAM- THE PROJECTIONS ARE SHOWING THAT IT'S ABOUT- TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS AND- THERE. IT'S SOLELY DRIVEN BY THE- THE TAX REVENUES COLLECTED ON THE SALES OF E. CIGARETTES SO- IT COULD BE VARIABLE BY THAT BUT THE PROJECTIONS ARE ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS REGARDING THE- THAT THAT GAP IN TERMS OF- IS THERE A GAP BETWEEN. THE FUNDING AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AND WHAT'S NEEDED I WOULD SAY IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE IS A WIDE GAP- HOWEVER REGARDING- THE SEISMIC STATISTICS I'M GOING TO ASK THAT CARL SURE MEN JUMP IN HERE- WHO IS A- WORKS WITHIN FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT DIVISIONS SEISMIC COMPLIANCE UNIT TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION FOR THEIR- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- AND- CHAIR. ARAMBULA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION R. TWO MILLION DOLLARS WHEN IT COMES TO- BUILDING IMPROVEMENT IS A VERY SMALL NUMBER- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS THAT ARE IN NEED. SO AS WE LOOK AT SPENDING UP THE PROGRAM ARE AND KNOWING THAT WE HAVE VERY FEW DOLLARS- IT TO BEGIN WITH. WE'RE LOOKING AT- THE CONDITION OF THE BUILDINGS AND ATTEMPTING TO ESTIMATE THEIR- WITH THE BOND CAPITAL NECESSARY AND THE FACT IS THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION ON FILE NECESSARY TO TELL US WHAT THE CONDITION OF THESE BUILDINGS ARE. MOST OF THEM ACHEVED A. R. A. N. S. B. C. TO PERFORMANCE RATING THROUGH THE HOUSES PROCESS WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE BUILDINGS BE EVALUATED THEREFORE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN IDEA OF THEIR DEFICIENCY. TO MOVE THE PROGRAM FORWARD AND TO HELP ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT YOUPOSED AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE INITIAL ROUND OF FUNDING AVAILABLE- WE ARE INTENDING TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THOSE FACILITIES THAT HAVE NOT DONE THEIR SEISMIC EVALUATIONS YET. IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING WITH THE BUILDINGS DEFICIENCIES ARE AND THOSE ARE RELATIVELY LOW COST- STUDIES WHERE WE CAN VERY QUICKLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DEMAND IS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE FOR THIS CATEGORY OF FACILITY AND I WOULD HOPE THAT BABY BY- MIDDLE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO ESTIMATE THAT. AS OF TODAY WE DO NOT HAVE THAT. FOLLOWING UP ON THAT AND- SO IT SOUNDED LIKE YOUR PRIORITIZATION THEN WAS TO FOCUS ON THE HOSPITALS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE NOT DONE A SEISMIC EVALUATION IS THAT CORRECT BUT NOT ABOUT TO FIX ANY OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING IMPROVEMENT. IT WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR ONE VERY BADLY DESIGNED COMPLIANCE PROGRAM TO ABSORB ALL OF THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. SO IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSURE RIGHT UP FRONT TO THAT THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT WISELY AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT. PUTTING THE MONEY FIRST- I WILL PUT A PIN IN THIS CONVERSATION AND YET I BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AS WE ARE HAVING A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT AFFORDABILITY HOW ARE ABLE TO MEET THE ALL QUEST ACT AND ADDRESS THE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS IN OUR STATE. IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR US TO HAVE AND JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT DOES NOT. APPEAR APPARENT BASED ON THE CONVERSATION TODAY THAT THE FUNDS FROM THIS EXCISE TAX WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS. THE UNDERLYING NEED AND THUS WANT TO MAKE SURE WE COME BACK TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION LATER. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL EIGHT WE WILL NOW MOVE ON THE PANEL NINE WHICH IS ON THE H.

AND JUST BECAUSE WERE FUNDING NAMI CALIFORNIA DOESN'T INHERENTLY MEAN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS SEEING. THE SAME AMOUNT OF BENEFIT IS HAVING A SPECIFIC PROGRAM AND TRAINING CITED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE NEXT LEVEL OF DETAIL I'D LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL TEN AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON.

MACINNES BEGAN- SO I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE PROGRAMS I'LL GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF AN UPDATE ON A VERY IS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS. ARM THAT WERE PRESENTED IN THE AGENDA ON PERSONAL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE FUNDING AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN FIFTEEN MILLION MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE INVESTMENT. THIS FUNDING PROVIDED FUNDING TO SUPPORT OF A VARIETY OF MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THAT. ACCOMPLISHED OUT OF THIS FUNDING IS WITH THIS FUNDING WE HAVE AWARDED A HUNDRED SIXTY TWO SCHOLARSHIPS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE UC IRVINE TRAINING TRAINERS PRIMARY. CARE PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. WE MADE OVER HUNDRED LOAN REPAYMENT AWARDS SINCE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND WITH THIS FUNDING WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO AWARD TEN ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE PURE PERSONAL TRAINING PROGRAM THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT- THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AWARD WHICH WILL RESULT IN ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED MARKET PERSONAL SPECIALISTS WILL BE TRAINED TO SERVE. IN THE PUBLIC BE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN BY FUNDING FOR THAT WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING ARE WHAT INVESTMENT. THAT BUDGET APPROPRIATED SIXTY MILLION TOTAL FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. WE HAVE AWARDED FORTY MILLION TO YOU ARE FIVE WET REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS. THESE BILLS FUNDING SUPPORTS THEM BEING ABLE TO SCHOLARSHIP LONELY PAYMENT STIPENDS RETENTION AND PIPELINE ACTIVITIES. WE ESTIMATE THAT THESE FUNDS WILL HELP SUPPORT OVER TWO THOUSAND MONTHLY PAYMENT AWARDS. AND ABOUT THREE HUNDRED STATEMENT JUST AS A AS. AN INDICATION OF SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE DON'T. ARM AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THIS FUNDING WE ESTABLISHED OUR PSYCHIATRY EDUCATION CAPACITY EXPANSION PROGRAM- WHICH I'VE TALKED ABOUT IT AGAIN THAT'S ABOUT EXPANDING- AT THE NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRISTS IN PART AND PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE TRAINED. ON HAND WITH A FOCUS REALLY ON ALSO TRAINING A JOB CHILD AND ADOLESCENT- RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THEN I'LL PROVIDE A QUICK UPDATE ON OUR ACTIVITIES FOR THE CHILDREN USE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE- WE RECEIVED EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION IN FUNDING FOR THAT INITIATIVE SPREAD ACROSS A VARIETY OF. OUR WORKSTREAMS. ALL HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING THERE- WE'RE CREATING A NEW SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACH AND COUNSELOR WORKFORCE. WHEN THE PROCESS OF DOING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT BY MEETING WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS IN EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE HELP US UNDERSTAND ON HOW DOMESTIC TO DESIGN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACH TO SERVE IN SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE'RE WE'RE SUPPORTING CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE UC IRVINE TRAIN THE TRAINER PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. ON WHICH IS IT REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAM EXPANDS THE CAPACITY OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS- TO SERVICE ALRIGHT ARE. COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS WE'VE AWARDED. OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SO FAR IN TRAINING OVER ONE HUNDRED NEW PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. WE'RE PREPARING TO OPEN A NEW GRANT CYCLES FOR OUR PSYCHIATRY EDUCATION CAPACITY PROGRAM FOR OUR PIPELINE PROGRAM THAT I MENTIONED. AND NOW AND WE'RE ALSO OPENING AGAIN ADDITIONAL LOAN REPAYMENT AND SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM CYCLES TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SERVING CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES. I WAS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WE RECOGNIZE HOW CRITICAL THAT IS AND YOUR FLOOR DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK AND PLAN TO AUGMENT AND BUILD A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKFORCE. AS WE KNOW THIS IS ESPECIALLY KEY FOR SERVING CHAU ADOLESCENTS AND YOUTH WE KNOW WHERE OUR THAT IT STARTS AT THAT AGE AND WE'RE WORKING TO TRY TO MITIGATE THAT RESEARCH- TO UNDERSTAND TO BUILD US TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY TO TRAIN SOCIAL WORK TO START THE WORK. THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BUILDING ON- WITH FUTURE FUNDING BUT TO REALLY FOCUS ON SOCIAL WORKERS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND YOU. WHERE WE ONLY HAVE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN AUGMENT OUR UNDERSTANDING AND BUT WORKFORCE TO SERVE SYSTEM AND JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH. AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO AUGMENT EXISTING PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP MANY OF THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT WE HEARD DISCUSSED EARLIER. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS ARE CRITICAL NOW AND THAT WE MUST ALSO BE SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW. SO WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE PROBABLY BE HERE TO HELP WORKFORCE SHORTAGES EXIST ACROSS ALL SECTORS INCLUDING IN THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS SCHOOLS STATE RUN FACILITIES. SO WE WANTED TO LOOK OUT WE ADDRESS THE MOST CRITICAL WORKFORCE SHORTAGES NOW WITH OUR EXISTING LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS THEY PROVIDE CLINICS AND ORGANIZATIONS A KEY WAY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF. AND THESE PROGRAMS FOCUS ON PLACING PROVIDERS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OUR WEB REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP GRANTS PROVIDE FUNDING TO HELP ATTRACT AND RETAIN BEHAVIORAL STAFF WORKING IN THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S LAGGING BEHIND IN THE NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRISTS NECESSARY. WE YOU KNOW HOW FOR CENTER AT UC SAN FRANCISCO IS REPORTED THAT VERY SOON WE WILL HAVE A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS AND EVEN TODAY IN SOME AREAS WE HAVE FEWER THAN ONE PSYCHIATRIST PER TEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS. OUR SUPPORT IN THE UC IRVINE TRAINING TRAINING TRAINING PROGRAM WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL I'M TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. IT ALSO SUPPORTS TRAINING OF INTEGRATED MODELS THAT INCLUDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PRIMARY CARE. AND OUR PSYCHIATRY EDUCATION CAPACITY EXPANSION PROGRAM PROVIDE NEEDED TO THE SPORT TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY TO TRAIN MORE PSYCHIATRISTS. WE ARE AWARE OF THE SHARP RISE IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION A MONSTER YOU. CALIFORNIA STATISTICS SHOW THAT YOUTH AGES FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN OF THE HIGHEST EMERGENCY EPARTMENT VISITS. AND HOSPITALIZATION RIGHTS PROJECT OVERDOSES AND USE AGE TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR OF THE HIGHEST RATE OF OVERDOSE RELATED DEATHS. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKFORCE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AND SO WE'RE WORKING ON. WAYS THAT WE CAN BUILD THAT- WORKFORCE. ONE REPAIR PROGRAMS HELP DEVELOP RECRUIT AND RETAIN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. WITH THEIR WORK ON THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE WE ARE FOCUSING ON EDUCATIONAL WAYS TO INCREASE CAPACITY OF THIS AS YOU WORKFORCE. I JUST WANTED TO JUST QUICKLY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ABOUT IN TERMS OF THAT CHILDREN YOU'D BE ABLE HEALTH INITIATIVE FUNDING BEING USED FOR PEER T PEER SUPPORT- AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THE PAIR PERSONAL TRAINING IN PLACING PLACEMENT PROGRAM WE FEEL IS CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT AND ENJOYABLE. TO THE OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE OUR PROGRAMS INTO THE CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS YOU CAN. ANSWER THIS THIS WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT PROGRAM- THROUGH THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AND WE WILL BE OPENING A NEW CYCLE HERE AT THE END OF MARCH. I ONE TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DOCTOR RYAN QUEST WHO IS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY PLEASE BEGIN. CHAIRS AND MEMBERS- MY NAME'S REHNQUIST AND I'M THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF A OF CALIFORNIA TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF C. B. H. TA. FIRST WE WANT TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE HISTORIC INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES TARGETING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. IN THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROPOSED THIS YEAR. THE PANDEMIC HAS TURNED OUR WORK FOR SHORTAGE INTO A CRISIS INCREASED DEMAND FOR SERVICES IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR COUPLED WITH IMMENSE STRESS BURNOUT WHICH INFLATION THE EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH JOB OPPORTUNITIES HAS RESULTED IN SOME. IN SOME PUBLIC BEHAVIOR HEALTH AGENCIES EXPERIENCING WORSE WORKFORCE VACANCIES OF 3240% OR MORE. D. H. DA HAS WAS ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE WORK FORCE GRANT RECEIVED THROUGH KAISER FOUNDATION AND LEARNED THAT WHILE ALMOST HALF OF COUNTIES ARE DESIGNATED AS MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS. SHORTAGES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY VALLEY EXPERIENCING. THE MOST EXTREME SHORTAGES. WELL SOMETHING USED HAVE CLIMBED DURING THE PANDEMIC R. S. U. D. WORKFORCE HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERVALUED WHICH IS ONLY EXACERBATED SIGNIFICANT WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. ALTHOUGH S. U. D. CANCERS MAKE UP THE CORE OF OUR S. U. D. WORK FORCE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DIVISION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL. FOUND THAT THEY NEEDED TO GROW THEIR S. U. D. COUNCIL WORKFORCE BY EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT. IN REVIEWING THIS ANALYSIS WAS STATE WIDE DATA WE ARE FINDING SIMILAR GAPS AND S. U. COUNCIL WORKFORCE STATEWIDE. SACRAMENTO COUNTY I'M WATCHING MY PROVIDER AGENCIES WORK FORCE GET DECIMATED BY COMPETING EMPLOYERS THEY'RE OFFERING GREATER PAY AND EASIER WORK SERVING LESS COMPLEX POPULATION. IN JANUARY WE INCREASED RATES BY 10% SPECIFICALLY TO ALLOW AGENCIES TO INCREASE SALARIES BUT THIS STILL DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ENOUGH. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PEOPLE OUT THERE TO DO THIS IMPORTANT AND CHALLENGING WORK. BECAUSE OF VACANCIES EXISTING STAFF FOR HAVING TO CARRY THE CASELOADS OF THREE AND FOUR OTHER PEOPLE LEADING TO BURNOUT RISK. WE HAVE A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH URGENT CARE PROGRAM THAT WE DECIDED TO FIND- UP. SO THEY COULD OPEN UP TO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE COMMUNITY. THEY CAN'T FIND ENOUGH STAFF TO EXPAND THEIR HOURS YET. IN SMALLER COUNTIES THIS WORK FIRST WORKFORCE CRISIS IS PARTICULARLY DEVASTATING FOR EXAMPLE IN NEVADA COUNTY THEIR S. U. D. RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROVIDER HAS CLOSED ONE. OF THEIR TWO FACILITIES TEMPORARILY DUE TO STAFFING ONE OF THE REST ONE OF THEIR S. T. R. T. PIECES SHUT DOWN. AND WHEN YOU'RE WORK FORCES SMALL TO VACANCIES ON ONE TEAM CAN EASILY BE 25% OF YOUR THERAPIST. AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF- THE DIFFICULTY FINDING BILINGUAL STAFF HAS BEEN MAGNIFIED. SO GIVEN THESE CHALLENGES C. H. D. A IS DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR PRIORITIZING THE NEED TO INVEST BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COURSE CORRECT AND EXPAND IN NEW WAYS TO BETTER SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. C. H. T. IN THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE ARE WORKING IN COALITION TO PUT TOGETHER TO PUT FORWARD A SERIES OF- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. FIRST WE NEED TO EXPAND THE EDUCATIONAL SLOTS TO SUPPORT HER CAREER PATHWAYS TOWARDS LICENSURE FOR ELEMENT TEAS- L. PCC'S AN LCSW AS WELL PSYCHIATRISTS. AND SPECIAL SPECIALIST IN ADDICTION MEDICINE INTERNSHIPS WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH A PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM TO TRAIN OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AND FIELD BASED TREATMENT MODALITIES TO SERVE THE COMPLEX POPULATION WE SERVE AS INTO YEAH AND IT'S SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED. IN THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WE NEED FUNDING TO SUPPORT TO WORK TUITION ASSISTANCE TEST PREP PREPARATION PAID INTERNSHIPS AND LOAN REPAYMENT FOR LICENSED AND NON LICENSED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. NESTOR ARAMBULA HAS BEEN BESIDES WE NEED TO DEVELOP A MORE A BURST PIPELINE WE'RE- THE PROPOSAL THERE IS BY PARTNERING WITH HIGH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN UNDER STRICT SERVE COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION C. H. D. A BELIEVES IT IS IMPORTANT THAT AND BUILDING OUR EDUCATIONAL SLOTS WE INVEST IN DEVELOPMENT OF A SPECIALIZED CURRICULUM FOCUSED ON PREPARING GRADUATES TO WORK IN THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. AND MENTAL HEALTH AN SUV AND A GRATION. DOESN'T WORK IS NOT THE TYPICAL THE STEREO TYPICAL OFFICE SPACE THERAPY THAT WE SEE ON TV AND IN MOVIE THIS REQUIRE SPECIALIZED TRAINING TO EFFECTIVELY DO THIS COMMUNITY BASED WORK. AND WHILE WE'RE EXCITED TO BRING IN MORE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT TO LEVERAGE EXISTING COUNTY INVESTMENTS AND CARES. UNLESS AND UNTIL WE ESTABLISH PEERS AS A STATEWIDE MEDICAL BENEFIT FOR ALL COUNTIES CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO FALL SHORT. MOMENTS AND POTENTIAL OF. OUR PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST WORKFORCE. WITHOUT A C. INVESTMENT IN BUILDING OUT THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINE ALL OF THE SYSTEM REFORMS IMAGINE WHETHER FOR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PARITY MOBILE CRISIS SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE AWFUL SHORT OF OUR HOPES FINALLY IN ADDITION TO THE INITIATIVES WE'VE REVIEWED WE ALSO EED ADDITIONAL SUSTAIN FUNDING DEDICATED TO ONGOING SERVICES SO WE CAN OFFER BETTER SALARIES AND ATTRACT OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE. INTO CHOOSING US AS THEIR CAREER PATH. LOOK FOR DANCING QUESTION ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DOCTOR JANET COFFMAN WHO IS FACULTY AT UCSF HEALTH FORCE CENTER PLEASE BE IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AROUND THE LINE THANK YOU HI TO ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I WILL BE SPEAKING YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS EASY A RESEARCHER- ARE WHOSE KIND KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THESE TOPICS NOT TALK FIRST ABOUT CHALLENGES AND RECOMMEND AND THEN ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS. IT WILL BE A LOT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN WHEN I HAVE TO SAY AND SOME OF WHAT'S BEEN SAID PREVIOUSLY. SO I THINK THE- CHALLENGES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE THAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA CAN LARGELY BE GROUPED INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES SUPPLY. DISTRIBUTION DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS ARE AS THAT TERM IS ON MENTIONED EARLIER FORECAST THAT I AND MY COLLEAGUES AT UCSF CONDUCTED. SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA'S FACING SHORTAGES OF PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL COUNSELORS SOCIAL WORKERS- AND WHILE OVER THE NEXT DECADE AND WHILE WE HAVEN'T LOOKED SPOKE SPECIFICALLY OF FORECASTING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COUNSELORS I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER AREA OF NEED- ONE MAJOR SOURCE OF THESE PROJECTED SHORTAGES IS THE AGENT OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. LARGE SHARES OF PEOPLE IN THESE PROFESSIONS ARE LIKELY TO RETIRE REDUCE THEIR WORK HOURS WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE. YOU KNOW I'M GRADUATES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT PREPARE PEOPLE TO BECOME BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SUGGEST THAT THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES IS NOT ADEQUATE TO REPLACE ALL RETIREES TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. AND THAT'S THE MOST RECENT YEARS FOR WHICH DATA ARE AVAILABLE THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COUNSELOR PROGRAMS ACTUALLY DECREASED AND THERE'S BEEN LITTLE GROWTH AND GRADUATES FROM MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAMS TO TRACK PREPARE PEOPLE FOR LICENSURE. NUMBER PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCES INCREASE BUT IT'S STILL FAR BELOW THE NUMBER NEEDED TO REPLACE RETIREES. IN HIS LONGSTANDING CHALLENGES RELATED TWENTY AGING WORKFORCE HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED. AB ALSO SERVICES WE'VE SEEN THE ENTRY OF NEW TELEVISION APRIL HEALTH PROVIDERS INTO THE MARKET AND THIS HAS RESULTED IN KEEN COMPETITION. AMONG EMPLOYERS AS OUR LAST SPEAKER JUST DESCRIBED CHALLENGING FOR THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUR SYSTEM A SURVEY THAT OUR TEAM CNDUCTED FOR THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION LAST FALL FOUND THAT OVER 60% OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES. HAD DIFFICULTY RECRUITING ALL TYPES OF LICENSED AND CERTIFIED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WORKFORCE IS WHERE WE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL THE INLAND EMPIRE AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY REGIONS HAVE RATIOS OF LICENSED BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PER POPULATION THEY'RE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THE STATE OVERALL. THE NORTHERN SYRIAN REGION HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER RATIOS OF PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS FOR POPULATION. CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE ALSO DOES NOT RELENT REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STATE'S POPULATION THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HARD TO FIND A DIVERSE PROFESSIONALS. BLACK AND LATIN NEXT UNDER REPRESENTED AMONG PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND LATIN X. ARE ALSO UNDER REPRESENTED AMONG MASTER'S-LEVEL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED AMONG TYPE ALL TYPES OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ACCEPT PSYCHIATRIST BUT EVEN AMONG PSYCHIATRISTS WHEN WE UNPACK ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER INTO SPECIFIC ETHNIC GROUPS THE COMPOSITION OF PSYCHIATRISTS DOESN'T REFLECT THE COMPOSITION OF POPULATION. WE ALSO DIVERSE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO SPEAK LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND THE LACK OF SPANISH SPEAKERS IS ESPECIALLY SEVERE AMONG PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS CHALLENGES WE FACE I'D NOW LIKE TO LEARN TO POSSIBLE TO TURN TWO POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS ARE A LOT OF. INITIATIVES OUT THERE THAT HOLD A LOT OF PROMISE BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER. THANK KEY COMPONENTS I THINK OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN INCLUDE PROMOTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CAREERS DEVELOPING THE PIPELINE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKERS AND IMPROVING GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION. I THINK PROTECT AROUND PROMOTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHRIS MANY CREATIVE APPROACHES TO WASTE AWARENESS OF BEHAVIORAL CAREERS AMONG RACIALLY ETHNICALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT LGBTQ PERSONS WHO WANT TO STICK TO INTERNEES PROFESSIONS. ARE UNLIKELY EMPTIES WE ALSO NEED MORE MEN HERE THE KEY DIFFERENCES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PSYCHIATRISTS THESE OCCUPATIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE SO WE KNEW WE NEED TO THINK OF HOW DO WE GET MORE MEN PARTICULARLY YOUNG MEN. INTO THESE PROFESSIONS TO SERVE PEOPLE IN NEED. HI POINT DEVELOPMENT XIN COMPASS BOTH INCREASING NUMBERS OF GRADUATES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND THE DIVERSITY OF GRADUATES. AND SO KAREN RIZZO HAS TALKED ABOUT EACH CASE EXISTING PROGRAMS FOR EXPANDING CAPACITY TO TRAIN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS INTO SOME MODELS- THAT CAN BE EASILY BUILT ON THERE- I WOULD SAY WE OUGHT TO TAKE PAGE FROM THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM. AND AWARD INCLUDE CRITERIA FOR AWARDING FUNDING THAT PRIOR TORIES AREAS OF THE STATE WITH THE GREATEST NEED FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AND ALSO I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO LOOK AT PRIVATIZING ACCELERATED PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONES THAT WAS WITH LANCE BYRD. MENTIONED BECAUSE THEY ENABLE US TO GET FOLKS INTO LICENSED PROFESSIONS MORE QUICKLY- CRITICAL THAT EXPANSION TRAINING SLOTS BE ACCOMPANIED BY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR STUDENTS I THINK A GOOD EXAMPLE WAS THE STIPEND PROGRAM FOR MASTER'S OF SOCIAL WORK STUDENTS THAT H. CHI- PREVIOUSLY OPERATED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND THAT PROGRAM HAD PAID BACK REQUIREMENT UNDER WHICH PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED A STIPEND MUST WORK IN THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOLLOWING GRADUATION. AS WELL AS THE CURRICULUM TO RENT THEM TO THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE SERVED BY. THE PUBLIC SYSTEM- SOME YOU KNOW SOME FUNDING FOR THAT HAS GONE OUT TO THE REGION'S UNDER WET BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE PERHAPS TO RE. RE CENTRALIZING AND REFOCUSING- ELIZABETH LANSFORD MENTIONED STIPENDS AND SCHOLARSHIPS REALLY- IMPORTANT CAN HURT THESE ARE OCCUPATIONS IN WHICH FOLKS JUST DON'T MAKE ENOUGH EVEN AT THE MASTER'S LEVEL. EASILY PAID LOANS AND CERTAINLY PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO STUDENTS WHOSE BACKGROUNDS REFLECTING THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIANS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. I'M SPENDING ABOUT TALKS SO MUCH ABOUT TODAY IS CAREER LADDER AND I GUESS IT'S CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT DIMENSION OF PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT. MAKING ENTERED HEALTH AND INTRIGUED OCCUPATIONS AS HMAN SERVICES ASSISTANCE CARE PROVIDERS OR SUBSTANCE USE. DISORDER COUNSELORS. AND ENTER THESE OCCUPATIONS HAS OFTEN BEEN HIGH- FOR THE REASONS THAT RANK WAS JUST TALKED ABOUT THE PEOPLE SPIRITS BURNOUT AND CONFINED LESS STRESSFUL JOBS IN OTHER-SECTORS THAT PAY SIMILAR WAGES. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SEE A CLEAR PATHWAY HOW THEY CAN HOW THEY CAN ADVANCE. TO A BETTER WAGE- AND MORE RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND SO I THINK WE CAN TAKE A PAGE FROM SOME WORK THAT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHO'S DONE THAT MAPS OUT CREATE EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS. FOR PEOPLE IN ENTRY LEVEL OCCUPATIONS TO ADVANCE AND I THINK THIS MAPPING SHOULD BE LEVERAGED TO DEVELOP MORE FORMAL PARTNERSHIPS AMONG EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND EMPLOYERS. TO FACILITATE CAREER LADDERS FOR INCUMBENT WORKERS IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND THEN LASTLY JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON RECURRING CHRIS SAID WE NEED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SYSTEM LEVEL CHALLENGES THAT AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO RECRUIT RETAIN PERSONNEL. AND THAT INCLUDES THE LEVEL OF MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL AS THE TYPES OF SERVICES INCLUDING PEERS. THAT ARE REIMBURSED STATEWIDE. SO I'LL STOP THERE AND THANK YOU MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DOCTOR LEE ANDHRA CLARK HARVEY CEO WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF. COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU AND GOOD EVENING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION MEMBERS THAT PROVIDE CARE TO OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS. ADULTS AND OLDER ADULTS I SUPPOSE SHARED SO ELOQUENTLY BY THE CHAIRWOMAN DURING PANEL FIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE OFTEN LOOK TO ASK THE ANSWER BUT OFTEN UNDER FUNDED AND YOU'VE HEARD THE STATISTICS ON THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE. SYSTEMATIC HOW AND ROMAN AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC OUR PROVIDERS ARE EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED STAFFING ISSUES CBO SO SHUT DOWN BEDS AND CLINICS SPACE DUE TO LACK OF STAFFING. AND ECHOING AGAIN THE CHAIRWOMAN YOU CAN NOT TALK ABOUT WORK FORCE FOR CBO'S WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF PAYMENT WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF WORKFORCE CHALLENGES. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES ARE PREVALENT PROVIDERS RAISE THE ISSUES ARE PROBLEMATIC REIMBURSEMENT RATES WITH THEIR COUNTIES AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE DON'T CONTROL THESE RATES. I'D BE REMISS TO DISCUSS DISCUSS WORKFORCE WITHOUT HIGHLIGHTING THIS PROBLEM SIMPLY COUNTIES CONTRACT WITH PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICE TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND WHILE THANKFULLY SOME COUNTIES LIKE SACRAMENTO OR DR CHRISTOPHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR OF WORK TO INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE EVEN PROVIDE ADVANCE PAYMENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN WORKFORCE IS HAMPERED AND SERVICE DEMAND IS HIGH. IN SOME CASES RATES ARE SO LOW THAT STAFF WHO ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO WORK CAN'T BE RETAINED. THIS ISN'T THE PLIGHT OF ALL CONTRACTS BETWEEN COUNTY SAN PROVIDERS BUT IT'S THE STORY OF FAR TOO MANY. OUR MEMBERS A BRAVE THIS PANDEMIC AND MANY AGENCIES ARE ON THE BRINK OF CRISIS WE'VE HEARD FROM MY. COLLEAGUE ALICK BRISCOE WHO TESTIFY ABOUT EIGHTEEN TO AN HOUR. THAT MATTER ARE PAID WELL COMMITTEE BASED OKAY. ARE CA WITH PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS TECHNOLOGY APPS AND EVEN AMAZON YES AMAZON WHO IS PAYING UP TO FORTY DOLLARS AND POWER WHEN I CHECKED LAST NIGHT. A MATCH AND GETTING YOUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS CERTIFICATE OR MASTER'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK OR MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY TO WORK IN THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM BUT ONLY TO BE MATCHED. WITH LOW PAY ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN SUCH AS ONEROUS PAPERWORK AND CASELOADS BURSTING AT THE SEAMS. AT HOME YOUR FAMILY AND YOU HAVE TWO MONTHS TO REPAY. I'M MATCHING OVERSEEING AGENCIES IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES WHERE YOU HAVE TO HIRE A TEAM OF STAFF JUST TRACK VARYING INTAKE PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH COUNTY YOU HAVE A CONTRACT THEN. THAT MONEY AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS TIME COULD BE BETTER SPENT. IMAGINE YOU'RE A CLIENT WAITING FOR WEEKS FOR AN APPOINTMENT AND SPENDING THE FIRST SESSION COMPLETING PAPERWORK. WE SIMPLY WANT TO PUT THE AGENCY ADMINISTRATORS CLINICIANS AND CLIENTS BEFORE DESPERATE AND IN SOME CASES UNNECESSARY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS I CONTRIBUTE TO BURNOUT OF THE HERO WORKERS. AND OUR STATE HAS NOT BEEN THE MOST FRIENDLY TAX OUT OF STATE PROVIDERS WHO LOOK TO TRANSITION OUR LICENSES TO CALIFORNIA TO BOLSTER OUR WORK FORCE. SO LICENSE RECIPROCITY SOLUTIONS MUST ALSO BE EXAMINED ESPECIALLY SOMETIMES WITH DISCUSSED ON THE FIRST PANEL THERE AREN'T ENOUGH TRAINING PROGRAMS AND RESIDENCY SLOTS FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS. AND PSYCHIATRISTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE TYPE OF WORK RESPONSE. AND BUILDING IN AGREE TEAMS ALSO BUILDS THE PIPELINE AND ALLOWS OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS TO ENTER THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. MEMBERS YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE EXPERIENCING PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CRISES PARTICULARLY YOUTH AND OLDER ADULTS AND WE NEED TO A STEP ESSENTIAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS READY TO ASSIST US WITH THE EMOTIONAL TOLL OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING THE H. HIGH PROPOSAL'S INCLUSIONS APPEAR FROM CHROMODORIS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS COACHES SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROFESSIONALS AND OTHERS. WE NEED FUNDING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND YOUTH INITIATIVE AND I PERSONALLY BENEFITED BENEFITTED FROM H. CHI AND THEN THEN IT WAS CALLED ASPECTS STATEMENTS TEN YEARS AGO IT STILL TOOK SEVEN YEARS FOR ME TO BECOME A PSYCHOLOGIST. MAYBE EVEN GET TO THE POINT OF APPLYING FOR THOSE FUNDS. OUR WORKFORCE NEEDS IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR RECENT CHANGES TO MINIMUM WAGE THE DIRE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES DUE THE PANDEMIC AND ALLOW FOR MORE COMPETITIVE WAGES IN ORDER TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT. ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL. WE REALIZE THAT SOLUTIONS MUST BE PURSUED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTY AND STATE PARTNERS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND SPECIFICALLY DH CS AND HOW THEY'RE WORKING TO RE ENVISION OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM OPERATES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING AROUND MORE SYSTEM. CHANGE AND INNOVATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR THAI RENT WHO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD EVENING CHEN ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS- TAVR RANDY AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES OR CAT HE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SUBCOMMITTEE. KATHY REPRESENTS FIFTEEN AT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROVIDERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS STATED BY YOU KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES TONIGHT WORKFORCE IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROVIDERS IN IS A REAL BEAR YOUR FRIEND PROVIDING MORE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS IN NEED. WE HAD A WORKFORCE- YOU KNOW- CRISIS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC I'M SORRY AND THESE A BONY BEEN EXACERBATED BY COBIT NINETEEN. CAN'T BE APPRECIATES THE DEDICATION ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORK FORCE THROUGH THE PROPOSED TWENTY SIX MILLION OF FUNDING FOR OPIOID PROVIDER CAPACITY THE SEVENTY MILLION FOR PROVIDER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVES. AND ASSIGNING OF AB SIX SIX SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK-SILVA JUST- IF YOU DAYS AGO HOW TO CREATE A STATEWIDE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKFORCE NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZING EACH KIND OF FIND SEVERAL WORKFORCE INITIATIVES. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT SO FAR BY EACH CHI AND A LOT OF THE WORK FORCE AREAS BUT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ON ALTHOUGH WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE- LARGER INVESTMENT IN THAT CITY WORKFORCE ARM. WHICH WAS INSTIGATED BY THE CHAIR. I DON'T TO REMIND THE CAN THAT. THERE'S NOT A DAY. SOURCE OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR THE SUV FIELD AS THERE IS WITH THE FIVE YEAR WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING ARE THE BLACK. PLANTS UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WE BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE THE SAME LEVEL OF ATTENTION AND DEDICATION. TO THE WORK FORCE AS IN THE WETLANDS- I LIVE IN A CALL SERVICES ACT. WE NEED TO CREATE EASIER ACCESS TO TUITION ASSISTANCE AND REIMBURSEMENT AND INCENTIVES FOR INDIVIDUALS TO FURTHER EDUCATION- IN WORKING IN THE PUBLIC BROWN STDS- VITAMIN. TELL ME THAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH WORKFORCE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR MASTER'S-LEVEL CLINICIANS LACK OF CERTIFIED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COUNSELORS. VISIONS AND NURSES. ADDITIONALLY CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT ROLES LIMIT OF WHO WE CAN TELL SERVICES FOR AND PREVENT STD PROGRAMS FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A BROAD SCOPE OF POTENTIAL WORKFORCE. EXAMPLE ALBION'S WHICH ARE KEY STAFF YOU KNOW WOMEN AND NON DRUG MEDI CAL RESIDENTIAL DETOX PROGRAMS- UNDER DRAMATIC HOW THEY CANNOT PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING SESSIONS. OR DEVELOP A TREATMENT PLAN THEY MUST BE REGISTERED AS THAT CITY COUNCILORS TO PROVIDE ANY SERVICE OTHER THAN MEDICATION MANAGED AT. ALL FOR THE ABILITY OF THE CERTIFYING ORGANIZATIONS FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COUNSELORS TO TIMELY PROCESS COUNSELOR CERTIFICATION AND RE CERTIFICATION APPLICATIONS BECAUSE BY THE PANDEMIC HAMPERS OUR ABILITY TO HIRE QUALIFIED STAFF. AS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE DR KERR CARDI WAS CVHS WE NEED TO LOOK AT RECIPROCITY BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES EVEN BETWEEN- AND WITHIN COUNTY IS. WHILE NOT A POLICY COMMITTEE HERE AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT MENTION A BILL THAT WE ARE BRINGING FORWARD TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE POLICY BARRIERS- CAN'T BE HAS PARTNERED WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS WARD. INTRODUCED AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY WHICH REMOVE A BARRIER THAT PREVENTS FUTURE LICENSE MASTER'S LEVEL CONNECT CLINICIANS FROM WORKING WITHIN. THE FIELD OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE GRADUATE STUDENTS IN MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY SOCIAL WORKER CLINICAL COUNSELING MUST COMPLETE A PRACTICUM AND FIELD WORK IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE PROGRAM. UNIVERSITIES PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY PROGRAMS FOR FIELD PLACEMENTS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN ON THE GROUND. IF A PERSON WANTS TO COMPLETE A PRACTICUM IN A LICENSE STD TREATMENT PROGRAM THEY MUST ALSO REGISTER WITH A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COUNSELOR CERTIFYING ORGANIZATION AS IF THEY WERE ON THE PATHWAY TO BECOMING. A CITY COUNCILOR. SOMETHING THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO DO IN A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM THIS PREVENTS THE BAY AREA RECRUITING FEUD ARCHER MASTER LEVEL CLINICIANS AND TO THE FIELD OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT- AN APOLOGIZE THE BILL WOULD BE- TO EXEMPT THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM HAVING TO REGISTER WITH THAT CITY COUNCIL ORGANIZATION. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND HOPEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL SUPPORT THE BILL. ONE AREA THAT WE'RE HOPING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH WORKFORCE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CALAMP. LIKE TO MENTION THAT PAYMENT REFORM AND DOCUMENTATION ARE CRITICAL FOR OUR PUBLIC S. U. D. DELIVERY SYSTEM TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED STAFF TO DELIVER. SERVICES TO SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE GREATEST NEEDS I'M ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND DOCUMENTATION BEATS THE BURN OUT OF PROVIDERS WHICH WAS ELOQUENTLY STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE AT CVHS. WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT PER PAYMENT REFORM WILL LEAD TO HIGHER RATES THAT'LL MAKE DRAMATIC HOW MORE COMPETITIVE. RIGHT NOW PROVIDER RATES ARE TOO LOW TO OFFER COMPETITIVE PAY THAT'LL ATTRACT- LICENSE MASTER'S-LEVEL CLINICIANS IN THE FIELD AND ENCOURAGE OUR REGISTERED STV COUNSELLORS TO CONTINUE ON TO BECOME CERTIFIED AND GAIN FURTHER COMPETENCIES. I'M THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE. TESTIMONY TODAY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW IT UP TO THE DIET AND- WILL BE- WITH DOCTOR DEFIED CAN- LAST WEEK IN A HEARING WE HAD HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT THERE WAS A GIVEN. THERE WAS A DECREASE DEMAND FOR SERVICES- OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS DURING THE PANDEMIC DUE TO. PEOPLE'S INABILITY TO COME OUT AND SEEK SERVICES. AS WELL AS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN PROP SIXTY THREE REVENUES. THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT COUNTIES ARE SITTING CURRENTLY ON NEW LARGE RESERVES. FROM PROP SIXTY THREE AND HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON IT. AND IF THEY ARE SITTING ON LARGE RESERVES WOULD YOU AGREE WITH PRIORITISING WORK FORCE FOR THESE RESOURCES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK SO YOU HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEY'RE SORT OF START WITH THE- DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES THAT STARTED OUT. AT THE BEGINNING OF COVETED- WE DID SEE A REDUCTION IN HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SEEKING SERVICES HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THAT DID THAT DID NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL NEED WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. PEOPLE WERE NOT HAVING NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY COULD CONTINUE TO SEEK TO ACCESS SERVICES SO PEOPLE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION WE'RE NOT AWARE THAT IT BUT SERVICES WERE AVAILABLE THROUGH TELEHEALTH- MORE RECENTLY I DO NOT SEE A REDUCTION IN DEMAND WE HAVE- WE HAVE A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF DEMAND TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH- OUR PROVIDER AGENCIES ARE NOT ABLE TO- KEEP UP WITH. WITH THE DEMAND- THAT SO MORE MORE RECENTLY THAT'S THE CASE WE DID- IN TERMS OF THE MHSAA FUNNY I WILL SAY THAT- NOT ALL OF OUR- PROVIDER AGENCIES WERE ABLE TO- I. PULLED OUT PULLED DOWN AS MUCH ALL OF THEIR MONEY OFTENTIMES BECAUSE THEY ASK OUR STAFF FOR OUT- DUE TO COPE ED AND- OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO KOBE AND- WHERE WE DID SEE IN PEOPLE. PROVIDERS NOT ABLE TO PULL DOWN THEIR FULL CONTRACTS SO WE DID HAVE SOME- WE DID HAVE SOME SAVINGS THAT WE DIDN'T EXPECT. THAT IN SOME AREAS AND OTHER AREAS WE SAW INCREASED COST BECAUSE- AN INPATIENT FACILITY LIKE A PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITY. I'M IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF COST NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THOSE BEDS. SO IT. IT WAS IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF- BOTH SIDES OF THINGS IN TERMS OF- THE EXPENSES- I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND SACRAMENTO WE ARE NOT SITTING ON A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. AND WE ARE WE ARE NOW YOU KNOW WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS EACH YEAR BASED ON- WHAT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE- SO. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT I THINK THEY WERE TRYING TO BE AS RESPONSIVE TO WHATEVER EACH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE ARE- REPORTING AND EXPERIENCING AS A RESULT OF THIS THIS- WHAT ENDEMIC NOW- SIX SITUATION WITH THE DEMANDS OF OUR OF OUR WORK ON A WORK FORCE IS MOST. ON OUR COMMUNITY IN THE NEEDS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. DR QUESTION YOU QUANTIFY WHAT YOU SAID WITH SAVING AND I WANT TO. MAKE SURE WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT SACRAMENTO COUNTY HERE BUT IN LARGE PART I'M WANTING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE FOR ALL OF OUR COUNTIES THAT MAY ALSO HAVE SAVINGS AND WHILE WE HAVE COME UP WITH. A PLAN FOR ENSURING THE SPENDING OF THOSE RESOURCES. I DON'T BELIEVE WE EXPECTED THE SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE NOW. AND SO I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN LIGHT OF WHAT YOU SAID REGARDING VACANCIES AND THE FACT THAT THE STATE DOESN'T CONTROL THE RATES TO HELP WITH THAT. HOW CAN WE INCENTIVIZE OUR COUNTIES TO PRIORITIZE WORK FORCE FOR THE INCREASES THAT WE HAVE SEEN WITHIN PROP SIXTY THREE REVENUES. WELCOME THE CONVERSATIONS I HAVE WITH MY COLLEAGUES- WE'RE ALL PRIORITIZING WORK FORCE RIGHT NOW- WOULDN'T AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE SAY THAT THEY'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH IT- WE'RE ALL DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN IN ORDER TO. MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND SUPPORT OUR PROVIDER AGENCIES IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO. SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS- I SEE YOUR QUESTION THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THAT. NO I. I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAILS BUT I WILL NOW THEN TRANSITION TO THE L. A. O. HAS THE L. A.O. DONE AN ANALYSIS OF THE COUNTY PROP SIXTY THREE RESERVES OR THEIR UNSPENT FUNDS. IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION DOCTOR AND- WE- DON'T HAVE A READILY PREPARED ANALYSIS TO PROVIDE ONLINE JUST SORT OF THE LEVEL OF UNSPENT FUNDS THAT COUNTIES HAVE SORT OF AT THEIR DISPOSAL WITH THEIR WITH THEIR IMAGES SAY REVENUES- WHEN IT COMES TO A COUNTY IMAGES THEY SPENDING YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW COUNTIES TO MAINTAIN A RELATIVELY SMALL DESIGNATED PRUDENT RESERVE TO KEEP AND STORE OF. TO KEEP IN STORE HE'S OF REVENUE WELL UNTIL VOLATILITY. WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT THOSE BALANCES ARE BUT BUT OUTSIDE OF THE PRUDENT RESERVES. UNSPENT A MAJOR STATE FUNDING. CAN BE ANCHORED INTERPRETED A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS IT CAN REFER TO FUNDING THAT'S ALREADY SORT OF. COMMITTED OR ENCUMBERED FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE BUT FOR WHICH YOU KNOW FUNDING HASN'T BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO A SPECIFIC PROGRAM ACTIVITY YET OR IT CAN REFER TO. IMAGES IMAGES THE FUNDING THAT IS ACTUALLY SORT OF NOT ENCUMBERED AT ALL FOR. FOR ANY PURPOSE- AND SO WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SOME DATA AVAILABLE THAT. SEVERAL SEPARATE OUT THIS CONCEPT OF UNSPENT FUNDS FROM COUNTIES PRINT RESERVES. WELL WE'RE LESS CLEAR ABOUT IS. WHETHER DATA EXISTS THAT FURTHER BREAKDOWN. ANY SORT OF COUNTY UNSPENT FUNDS BETWEEN SORT OF ENCUMBERED AND UNENCUMBERED SHARE OF THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A SORT OF AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT COUNTY UNSPENT FUNDS TRULY SORT OF REPRESENT- OUR OUR SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO PERHAPS ASK THE ADMINISTRATION WHETHER THIS THIS DATA BREAK DOWN EXCESS- AND IF IT DOES- YOU KNOW WE WOULD SORT OF THEN BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT BACK. ON THIS SORT OF AMOUNT OF UNSPENT FUNDS THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE SERVE INTERESTED THAT COULD BE TARGETED FOR USE BY THE LEGISLATURE. LIKE TO THEN FOLLOW UP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND SEE IF THIS IS INFORMATION THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR WELCOMED TO GUESS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WILL TAKE YOUR QUESTION BACK AND SEE IF THERE IS INFORMATION THAT WE CAN'T PROVIDE ON THIS QUESTION- I WILL THEN FOLLOW UP WITH THE L. A. O. WHEN DO YOU THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR US TO REASSESS THE COUNTY PROP SIXTY THREE RESERVES. IN A FOLLOW UP TO THE TWENTY THIRTEEN STATE AUDIT THAT IDENTIFIED LARGE RESERVES IN SOME COUNTIES IS THERE AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR US TO DO THAT FOLLOW UP. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION DOCTOR IN THE LAB I DON'T KNOW IF WE- HAVE SORT OF A- I THINK MADE A TIME FRAME THAT WE'VE SORT OF COME UP WITH IN THE COURSE OF LIKE OUR ANALYSIS FOR WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE SORT OF. LATE THE TIME TO SORT OF REASSESS THINGS- WE DO WE ARE AWARE THAT- IN RESPONSE TO SOME FINDINGS FROM. THIS IS THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT- CAME OUT SOME YEARS AGO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS SORT OF IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF. CHANGES TO SORT OF THE MHSAA REVERSION POLICY AND JUST GENERALLY FISCAL OVERSIGHT MATTERS OVER AN HSA IN GENERAL- SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THAT'S ARE HELPFUL FOR YOU BUT WE CAN WE CAN KIND OF TAKE THAT BACK AND SORT OF SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN WE CAN PROVIDE FOR YOU. BERMAN AND ONE MORE THING. PLEASE THE- DOCTOR QUEST THANK YOU. KNOW THE ONE THING I SHOULD KNOW IS THAT WE'RE ALL MANAGING THIS IN OUR OWN WAY AND YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'RE SUCCESSFULLY DOING THAT IN THAT- LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OF OUR IMAGE AS A FUNDS. ARE REVERTED SO- WE JUST MENTIONED ARE THERE IS A REVERSION POLICY AND SO WE'RE ALL MANAGING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WE AVOID THAT REPRESENT. HAVING HELPED. IF I COULD ADD I'M NOT SURE THAT DATA POINT IS. GOING TO SUFFICE THE CURIOSITY WE HAVE WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THE DOLLARS. ARE BEING SENT EFFECTIVELY JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T REVERTED ON DOESN'T MEAN. WE DON'T HAVE THE OVERSIGHT THAT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE. THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS NEEDED WITH THESE DOLLARS AND I WOULD JUST POINT TO HISTORY. AND THE AUDIT RESULTS TO FIND THE IMPETUS FOR US TO BE ASKING THE NATURE OF OUR QUESTIONS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR COUNTIES AND ENSURING THAT THOSE PROP SIXTY THREE RESERVES ARE AT THE PRUDENT RESERVES LEVEL THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT. BUT IT'S IN. BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE CRISIS AND WE NEED TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF WE CAN'T. AND I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WERE IN IN THE MOMENT IS. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF TOP EARNERS DO QUITE WELL AND DUE TO THE NATURE OF MHSAA COLLECTING ON THOSE TOP EARNERS WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN REVENUES AND- REALLY WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON HOW WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THOSE COUNTIES. TO BE SPENDING EFFECTIVELY INTO WORK FORCE AND- WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH QUESTIONS BUT I BUT I DO WANT TO. DIG INTO SOMETHING BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WHEN WE CREATED THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME UNDERSTANDING OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT WE DO NOW. IN CALLING IT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND- AND MAKE SURE I'M CLARIFYING THAT CURRENTLY THE WHAT FUNDING WE'VE BEEN DOING THE FIVE YEAR PLANS DO NOT APPLY TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AND WHETHER OR NOT. ANY OF OUR- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A MISSING LINK AND AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING TO INVEST INTO. FOR EITHER DOCTOR QUESTOR DR LEANDRA CLARK HARVEY. HEY WE DEFINITELY ARE ARE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING OUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKFORCE- RIGHT NOW OUR UNDERSTANDING- I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T THINK OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE WEAPONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THAT PURPOSE. SO IN TERMS OF AN HSA FUNDS BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO EXPLORE THAT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOWARDS. THANK YOU SIR CBJ OBVIOUSLY ARE FOUND URESTI FELIX AUTHOR PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE WITHIN THEIR OFFSPRING SAMBERG- AND- WHEN THIS ACT WAS FIRST RENDON IT WAS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND I REMEMBER TALKING TO RUSTY YOU KNOW WHEN I CAME ON TO CBO CHENEY SAID ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I MESSED WITH INCLUDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROFESSIONAL SO TERROR RAMBLING YOU ARE. RIGHT ON SPOT ON AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR A VERY LONG TIME YOU HEARD IT THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATIONS TODAY AND THE POINTS MADE I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT I HEARD YOU KNOW DR CHRIS TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL THE IMPORTANCE OF IT- BUT WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES INTO YOU YOU KNOW REFORMING THE ACT IN MAKING CHANGES. BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR PROVIDER COMMUNITY. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN ENSURE WE ARE- WORKING ON- ON THIS SPECIFIC. ISSUE AND BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US. GOING FORWARD. AND WOULD SIMPLY. POINT OUT HOW IN THE LAST WHAT. PLAN WE REQUIRED A 33% COUNTY MATCH. AND I'M WONDERING IF WE'RE SITTING ON. LARGE RESERVES WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO INSIST ON COUNTIES. HELPING US TO PARTICIPATE- AS WELL TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THIS FUNDING. AND SUSTAINABILITY LONG TERM. WITH THAT I WILL THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ON PANEL ELEVEN WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL WHICH IS ON WORKFORCE CHALLENGES IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND OF COURSE IS EVEN MORE SO AS WE HAVE WATCHED CODED RAVAGE OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN NURSING HOMES.

INCREASING THE CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT WORKFORCE WRECKED YOUR WORKFORCE IN OPPORTUNITIES. AS THE CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT WORKFORCE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE HAVE CONDUCTED TWENTY SEVEN INTERVIEWS WITH HOW HHS AGENCIES WORKFORCE RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS ADVOCACY AND POLICY ORGANIZATIONS HOME HEALTH PROVIDERS AND REPRESENTATIVES TO LABOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT OF OUR ANALYSIS AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PRIORITIES TO HELP BUILD THE CNA WORKFORCE.

I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT- THE MANY ISSUES THAT NURSING HOME WORKERS ARE FACING TODAY AND THESE ARE ISSUES THAT HAVE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED SINCE THE ONSET OF OVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC THEY'VE ALSO DRASTICALLY IMPACTED THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. UNFORTUNATELY NURSING HOMES HAVE BEEN AT THE CENTER OF THE PANDEMIC WITH NURSING HOME WORKERS DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPOSED TO COVER NINETEEN WHILE CARING FOR SOME OF THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS FROM JUNE. OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'M OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND NURSING HOME WORKERS AND RESIDENTS CONTRACTED COVE IN NINETEEN AND UNFORTUNATELY MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND PASSED AWAY FROM THE VIRUS. SO ALTHOUGH NURSING HOME WORKERS WERE LABELED AS ESSENTIAL WORKERS THEY STRUGGLE TO GET THE CRITICAL PROTECTIONS THEY NEEDED TO KEEP THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILIES AND THE RESIDENTS OF NURSING HOME SAFE SOME WORKERS EVEN RESORTED TO WEARING TRASH BAGS- WHEN THE PROTECTIVE AT PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WAS SCARCE THEY ALSO. HAD TO RE USE THINGS LIKE N. NINETY FIVE MASKS OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE WAS JUST NOT HAVING THAT- PROTECTION AT ALL- CALLS FOR HAZARD PAYING PAID TIME OFF WENT LARGELY AN ANSWER AS WORKERS TO CONTINUE TO RISK THEIR LIVES DAILY- MEANWHILE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR NURSING HOME OPERATORS WAS GIVEN READ ONLY. INCLUDE A 10% MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATE INCREASE AND FOUR POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL PROVIDER BUT WE FIND THAT WAS ST STE DISTRIBUTED TO OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND NURSING HOMES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO SAY ABOUT THESE TERRIBLE SITUATIONS WERE JUST AN ANOMALY. THAT SURFACED DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE- NURSING HOME WORKERS HAD ALREADY BEEN EXPERIENCE SEEN MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WITH STAFFING WAGES BENEFITS WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS THAT PREDATED THE PANDEMIC BY MANY YEARS- THE WORK THAT THESE WORKERS PERFORM IS. IT'S PHYSICALLY EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY DRAINING AND THERE'S LITTLE RECOGNITION FOR THE COMMITMENT TO CARING FOR THE ELDERLY DISABLED AND CHRONICALLY ILL. I NURSING HOME MORE CONSISTENTLY RANKS AMONG THE JOBS WITH THE HIGHEST RATES OF OCCUPATIONAL INJURY AND ILLNESS GET THE PAY AND BENEFITS GENERALLY DO NOT REFLECT THE REALITY OF THE WORK. THE MEDIAN INCOME FOR NURSING HOME WORKERS IN TWENTY TWENTY WAS JUST THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THERE IS MORE THAN A 50% TURNOVER RATE AMONG DIRECT CARE WORKERS IN SNACKS. AND MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND WORKERS HAVE LEFT THE INDUSTRY SINCE JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. INSTEAD OF IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS WAGES AND BENEFITS TO ADDRESS THE TURNOVER AND RETENTION ISSUES NURSING HOMES WERE INSTEAD GIVEN STOPPING WAIVERS THAT ALLOW THEM TO OPERATE AT STAFFING LEVELS. THAT ARE LOWER THAN THE MINIMALLY MANDATED LEVELS FOR DIRECT CARE WORKERS SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED STAFFING WAIVERS HAVE BEEN APPROVED AND OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WERE PROVIDED AS ADAM PAYMENTS OF FACILITIES. TO COVER THE COST OF HIRING NEW WORKERS BUT THIS FUNDING SNAPS CONTINUE TO BE UNDER STAFFED AND THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS HAVE YET TO BE FULLY ADDRESSED. WE WILL ONLY SEE REAL CHANGE IN NURSING HOMES IF EMPLOYERS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC DOLLARS THEY RECEIVED AND IF WORKERS AND RESIDENT ADVOCATES ARE ABLE TO DIRECTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS- BY BRINGING TOGETHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE WORK FORCE EMPLOYERS ADVOCATES AND STATE AGENCIES IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY. SEVEN ENFORCE WORKPLACE STANDARDS THAT COVER ALL WORKERS IN THE SNIFF INDUSTRY QUALITY STANDARDS BOARD WOULD CREATE A VENUE FOR WORKERS TO COME TOGETHER SHARE LESSONS THEY'VE LEARNED FROM THEIR DAY TO DAY EXPERIENCE AND GAIN A STRONGER VOICE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES. MEASURABLE STANDARDS THAT APPLY INDUSTRY WIDE WHEN INSURE THAT ALL WORKERS REGARDLESS OF RACE GENDER. OR DISABILITY STATUS EARN FAIR WAGES UNDER BETTER CONDITIONS REDUCING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISCRIMINATION BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY BY ADDRESSING OTHER CAUSES HE GAPS SUCH AS INCONSISTENT SCHEDULING OR A LACK OF MEDICAL OR- FAMILY LEAVE. THESE EFFORTS WOULD ALSO DIRECTLY THE END IMPACT THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS MAKING SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES A DESIRE LONG TERM CARE OPTION FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT. WE CAN ALSO BEGIN TO MOVE THE INDUSTRY FORWARD BY MAKING MEANING MEANINGFUL FORMS OF THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM SNAPS HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY REWARDED BY THE STATE WITH RATE INCREASES AS WELL AS INCREASES TO THE PERCENTILE CAPS. ON DIRECT AND INDIRECT HERE LABOR CALL CENTERS WITH THE INTENTION OF ELEVATING THE QUALITY OF CARE YEAH WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE USE OF RELATED PARTIES AND COMPLICATED OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES THAT OPEN THE DOOR FOR EXCESSIVE PROFITS FOR NURSING HOME OWNERS AND OPERATORS. THERE'S BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE FUNDING BEING UTILIZED FOR LABOR WHICH LARGELY DICTATES THE AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED TO NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. CURRENT QUALITY METRICS DO NOT INCLUDE. ENOUGH CARE CENTER CATEGORIES SUCH AS STOPPING LEVEL IMPROVEMENT ENHANCED TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT AND CONSISTENT NURSING STAFF ASSIGNMENTS. IN ADDITION THE FARMERS BE SET HIGHER SO THAT NURSING HOMES WITH A HISTORY OF SERIOUS VIOLATIONS THOSE ON THE CMS SPECIAL FOCUS WAS SOLELY LESS. THOSE THAT HAVE FAILED TO PAY THEIR QUALITY ASSURANCE FEES AND THOSE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE AND PASSED THROUGH LAWS WILL NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE ALL THE PAYMENTS QUALITY RATE INCREASES. THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT AND NECESSARY CHANGES THAT WILL PAVE THE WAY TO NURSING HOME REFORM. WE HAVE BEGUN TO SEEN SOME CHANGES OF THIS NATURE BEING PROMOTED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO ENSURE STAFF SAFE STAFFING RATIOS IN ALL FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE WHOLE NURSING HOMES ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY DON'T PROVIDE EXCEPTIONS. OR THEIR WORKERS AND RESIDENTS AND TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT NURSING HOMES AND INCREASED. RECALL THESE FEDERAL EFFORTS AND ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE WAY AND BECOMING A MODEL FOR NURSING HOME INDUSTRY THAT INVESTS IN ITS ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THE PEOPLE AND FAMILIES. RELY ON. THIS CARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM NICOLE HOWELL WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR EMPOWERED AGING. PLEASE BE AN INFORMED DECISION YES. HELLO DOCTOR AMBULANCE OTHERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME BACK TO SHARE WITH YOU MORE ABOUT HEALTHCARE CAREER PATH LEADING. UP I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THE HEALTHCARE CAREER PATHWAY BEGAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY PROVEN OUT DURING THE PANDEMIC. IT IS A WRAPAROUND HOLISTIC APPROACH TO TRAINING CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS AS WE BUILD A PATHWAY TO FUTURE JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN ADDITION TO SIMPLY ARE MEETING THE BASIC ONE HUNDRED SIXTY HOURS OF TRAINING WE DOUBLES. YEAH I NEED. TO ENSURE THAT IS A HOLISTIC APPROACH AT A TO BOTH THE HARD SKILLS THAT THE CNA'S MUST HAVE TO THEIR DILIGENT AND CHALLENGING WORK. BUT ALSO GO OUT TO INCLUDE THOSE SOFT SKILLS THAT WE HEARD FROM EMPLOYERS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. AND TODAY OUR PROGRAM THAT'S TAKEN PLACE OVER THREE YEARS NOW AT TWO LOCATIONS HAS GRADUATED SEVENTY ONE STUDENTS. UP WITH TWO MORE CLASSES CURRENTLY IN SESSION. 80% OF THOSE ARE STILL WORKING IN THE LONG TERM CARE- WORK FORCE. BUT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS CHALLENGES WE ACTIVELY SEEK OUT STUDENTS WHO HAVE ADDRESSABLE BARRIERS EITHER THEY'VE EXPERIENCED EDUCATIONAL TRAUMA MAYBE THEY'RE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO ACHIEVE ANY POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. MAYBE THE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS OR PRIOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS- AND SO WE MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE ALL OF THE WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES WHICH INCLUDE TRANSPORTATION- SUPPORT WORKING THROUGH PROBLEMS FOOD THAT GOES HOME WITH THEM ON THE WEEKENDS AND ENSURING THEY HAVE LUNCH EVERY DAY DURING CLASS. AND OUR STUDENTS REMAIN SUCCESSFUL AND COMMITTED TO THE LONG TERM CARE INDUSTRY. AND THROUGH OUR CONVERSATION IN FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY IF YOU COULD. THROW YOURSELF BACK TO THAT PLACE- YOU RIGHT FULLY INVESTED IN THIS PROGRAM AND ASK US TO EXPAND IT TO ADDITIONAL COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO UP TO FIVE LOCATIONS- OVER FIVE YEARS. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS DOING THAT- BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS DEEPLY CHALLENGING ABOUT A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT PROGRAM AND YOU HEARD SOME OF IT EARLIER AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE M. TEES. IT IS AN ENTRY POINT INTO THE ALLIED HEALTH CARE FIELD. BUT UNLIKE OTHER ALLIED HEALTH CARE FIELD TRAINING PROGRAMS IT REQUIRES THAT THE DO YOU HAVE A DIRECTR THAT IS A REGISTERED NURSE. WHO HAS HAD TWO YEARS OF NURSING AND ONE YEAR OF EXPERIENCE WORKING IN LONG TERM CARE FIELD AND ONE YEAR OF EXPERIENCE TEACHING ADULTS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT YOU FOR THE INSTRUCTOR YOU HAVE AN LPN. UNLIKE OTHER PROGRAMS SAY AN EMT A SURGE TECH DENTAL ASSISTANCE WHICH CAN BE LED AND INSTRUCTED BY A COLLEAGUE. AT WE'VE ALREADY HEARD HOW SHORT STAFF NURSES ARE IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND THIS REQUIREMENT AT IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE IT OUR AND LEADING A CNA TRAINING PROGRAM WHO MAY THEMSELVES HAVE NEVER WORKED AS A CNA. AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE IT FOR THREE FIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS. IS REALLY WHAT MAKES THIS PROGRAM VERY CHALLENGING OUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HIRE A PROGRAM DIRECTOR THAT MEETS THESE RIGID REQUIREMENTS. AND IT IS TRULY TO OUR DETRIMENT BECAUSE MANY C. N. A.'S WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD FOR. DECADES WOULD ACTUALLY BE GREAT IN THIS ROLE. AND AT DR RAM TO THE TO YOUR EARLIER POINT AROUND EQUITY AND INCLUSION- THIS IS WHAT IS THE UNDERVALUING OF PARTICULARLY WOMEN. PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR AND THEIR LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE SECTOR WE NEED NEW CREATING MORE PATHWAYS AND SOMETIMES OUR RESTRICTIONS. ARE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LAUNCH PROGRAMS OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE. AS YOU MAY RECALL THE BEAUTY OF OUR PROGRAM WAS THAT FIVE SITES COULD SHARE ONE PROGRAM DIRECTOR THEREFORE IT COST SAVINGS- BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE CAN ACTUALLY GET IN OUR AND BECAUSE THERE ARE SO RIGHT RT. IN A DESPERATE SHORT SUPPLY. ADDITIONALLY SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEONE OF THE TREMENDOUS RN DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY ARE STEEPED IN ADULT LEARNING PRINCIPLES. PARTICULARLY WORKING WITH MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND COMMITTING TO A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK. SO WHEN WE SAY WE NEED TO PROGRAM DIRECTOR IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WRITING TO SANTA AND ASKING FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT EARLY- ADDITIONALLY. OUT WE HAVE HAD HEARD MANY THINGS TODAY ABOUT THE PROGRAMS IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ACROSS THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR. AND I WANT TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT TO YOU THAT THE WHITE HOUSE RECENTLY MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE STATE THE UNION THAT THEY ARE INVESTING IN SKILLED NURSING IMPROVEMENTS AND ARE DIRECTING- THE HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AND CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. TO UNDERTAKE SEVERAL KEY INITIATIVES. ONE OF THOSE ENSURING ADEQUATE PAY. ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR GREAT AND LOVELY. BUT IF WE DO NOT RAISE THE WAGES FOR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS AND THOSE WORKING IN THE LONG TERM CARE SECTOR. WE WILL NOT SEE THE INCREASE IN RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION THAT WE ALL DESPERATELY DESIRE. ACCORDING TO SOME RECENT- BUT THAT WORK DONE OUT OF UCS AFTER CHARLENE HARRINGTON IT SAYS THAT OPIS TURNOVER IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IS ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND 20% ANNUALLY. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THAT CREATES TREMENDOUS CHANGES FOR THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THESE FACILITIES. AND SO I'M HERE TODAY TO UPDATE YOU ABOUT OUR PROGRAM BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE FOR YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TO FINALLY GAIN DEEPER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS. IN OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. IF WE CANNOT PAY OR CARE GIVERS MORE WE WILL NOT KEEP THEM AND WE WILL KEEP SEEING THESE TERRIBLE INCIDENTS IS THAT WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT COBIT. AND SO I ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT IN TWO WAYS FIRST OF ALL. WHAT IS THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND DOESN'T MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PROVIDERS. AND SECONDLY WHAT IS BEEN THE ROLE OF PRIVATE PRIVATE EQUITY AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND IS ALL OF THE MONEY GOING DIRECTLY TO THE CARE OF THE RESIDENT. THAT'S THEY SO DESERVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DR ELIZABETH HALIFAX AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT UCSF PLEASE BEGIN. RIGHT CAN YOU SEE ME. YES AS SOON AS YOU BEGIN SPEAKING YOU'LL SHOW UP ON THE SCREEN. YES I'M ELIZABETH HALIFAX AND- I AM I AM THE- ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT UCSF. I'M UNDERTAKING RESEARCH IN NURSING HOME CARE THAT IS INCLUDED SAY STALKING STANDARDS. BUT I DID START THIS JOURNEY AS A NURSING ASSISTANT AND I HAVE BEEN LICENSE AS A REGISTERED NURSE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. I'M A MEMBER OF THE GERIATRICS CIRCLE A GROUP OF ACADEMICS AND PROVIDERS OF ADVISED CALIFORNIA'S DEPARTMENT OF AGING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES. ON ISSUES RELATED TO CONVERT NINETEEN OF LONG TERM CARE. THE MOST ESSENTIAL SYSTEMIC ISSUE IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT CAST FOR VULNERABLE PEOPLE IS ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE STOPPING TO ENSURE QUALITY CARE IS PROVIDED STRONG POSITIVE IMPACT OF NURSING STOPPING THE TYPICALLY AREN'T STOPPING. ON THE PROCESSES AND OUTCOMES OF K. THE RECENT TRAGIC FAILINGS TO KEEP CALIFORNIA NURSING HOME RESIDENTS SAFE AND WELL CARED FOR DURING THE PANDEMIC I'M NOT NEW. BUT PART OF AN ONGOING KIND OF UNDERSTAFFING AND HIGH TENER RESIDENT QUE IN TWO WAYS. RESIDENTS TO NOT RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED RESULTING HOMES ABUSES OKAY REPORTED AS THE TO TALK CALIFORNIA NURSING HOME COMPLAINTS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. SECONDLY BURTON STOKE SOCCER POOL WORKING CONDITIONS COMPASSION FATIGUE BURNOUT THAT IN TURN IMPACTS RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND HIGH TURNOVER TURNOVER AS WE HEARD FROM AND TO STEAL. IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY THE AVERAGE ANNUAL TURNOVER RATE FOR DIRECT INSTALL THING WAS 55% BUT IS THAT IMPACT SO THAT AS I SAID INCLUDE HEAVY WORKLOAD LOW WAGES CALL BENEFITS LIMITED RESPECT RECOGNITION ALSO POOLS AND FEW PROSPECTS FOR ADVANCEMENT I KNOW THAT'S BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT READY. BUT INCREASINGLY WITH THE PANDEMIC WE'RE SEEING A MOTIONAL ON MORAL DISTRESS IS ONE OF THE BURN OUT PRACTICE. IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE NATIONAL CONSUMER VOICE ISSUED REPORTS RESIDENTS AND FAMILY SURVEYS AND WHEN ALMOST RESIDENTS ARE YOU RECEIVING THE CARE YOU NEED WHEN YOU NEED IT. A MAJORITY 60% SAID NONE. SOME DESCRIBED FEELING IMPRISONED ONE RESIDENT STATUS IT. OFTEN LEFT IN SOILED BRIEFS LEFT IN BED TOO LONG OR THE CHAIR TOO LONG NO SCHOOL RIGHT NOT ALWAYS ONSTAGE WAITING FOR HOURS THE STOCK NUMBER TWO ALSO MICHAEL WHITE MEETINGS AND WEEKENDS. THAT'S NOT ANY HOLD FOR THE RESIDENTS IT'S HARD FOR THE STOP TRYING TO COPE WITH THOSE NEEDS. STOPPING IN NURSING HOMES ALL ACTUAL AND ISSUE OF EQUITY. HEALTHEQUITY RESIDENTS WHO ARE DENIED ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE BECAUSE OF LOS STOPPING. WHERE RESIDENTS TO RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO RESIDE IN NURSING HOMES RECALL STOPPING AND HIGH NUMBERS OF DEFICIENCIES. I WENT MISSING HOMEWORK OFTEN DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. IT'S ALSO WORKFORCE EQUITY ISSUE WITH OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 15% LIVE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. AND MORE THAN ONE HALL FOR THE NURSING HOME SEE AN ACE UP PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MAJORITY WOMEN. TO BE CLEAR THIS MEANS THE HIGH TURNOVER REPORTED SHORTAGES OF ALL RAIMES IN NURSING ASSISTANTS I'M NOT DURING TIMELY TO AN ADEQUATE LABOR SUPPLY BUT ROTH OF THE RESULT OF COOL WORKING CONDITIONS. LOW WAGES AND HEAVY WORKLOADS. NURSING HOME OPERATORS NEED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WHILE USING THE MONEY THEY RECEIVE FROM GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALMOST A 100% OF THEIR REFUSE ON DIRECT CARE FOR RESIDENTS INCLUDING ADEQUATE STOPPING. RATHER THAN RECEIVING ACT AND WE HAVE FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST IS TO ENACT STOPPING MINIMUM OF FOUR POINT ONE HOURS PER RESIDENT DAY THOUSAND ONE SENTENCE TO MEDICARE MEDICAID BENCHMARK STUDY THAT DETERMINED THIS MINIMUM IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT HOME IN JEOPARDY TO RESIDENTS. WITH THE MASSIVE EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH THAT EXIST CALLS FOR A NEW STUDY TO DETERMINE NEEDED STOPPING MINIMUMS MAKE NO SENSE NEEDED REFORMS. SECONDLY I WOULD ALSO YOU STOP ISSUING STOPPING WINTERS WHEN STOPPING WHEN WAS ISSUED NURSING HOMES ARE EXEMPT FROM BEATING CALIFORNIA'S INADEQUATE THREE POINT FIVE HOURS CONVINCING RESIDENT DAY STOPPING MINIMUM. THIS AFFECTS ALL ASPECTS OF CARE AND WORKING CONDITIONS AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT INCLUDING- IT INCLUDES RECENT CREASED RESIDENT AND SELF CONFIDENCE SECTIONS AND DEATHS IN NURSING HOMES WITH- WITH WAITERS. WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT THE- IF WE NEED TO REQUIRE A REGISTERED NURSE TO BEYOND YOU SEE AN OLD LISTING HOMES TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. AS THE ONLY FULL TIME STOP IN A NURSING HOME WITH THE TRAINING TO CLINICALLY ASSESS THE RESIDENTS AND KEY TO ENSURING INFECTION CONTROL. ARMS CANNOT BE SUBSTITUTED BY LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES. FALSELY ENSURE ADEQUATE WAGES TO REDUCE REDUCE THE STOCK TURNOVER. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WAGES FOR LICENSING MISSING STYLE A COMPATIBLE TO HOSPITAL WAGES WITHIN THE AREA. WE NEED TO GROW CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS MINIMUM WAGES TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND FINALLY I WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT DURING THIS. SESSION WE NEED TO INVEST IN WORKFORCE TRAINING AND CAREER PROGRESSION. AND I SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT CARE RESULTS THAT THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES NOT THE NURSING HOMES WITH FUNDS TO OPTIMISING STRESS SYSTEM CERTIFICATION TRAINING WITH NO OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES. AND WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO PROVIDE CRITICAL LISTENING STYLE THROUGH TRAINING AND EDUCATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING ME TODAY WILL HEAR FROM CLAIRE AND RIGHT WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE QUALITY CARE HEALTH FOUNDATION PLEASE BEGIN. YOU FOR AROUND THE WORLD AND REMEMBER THANK YOU. THANK THE FIRE IN WRITING DIRECTOR THE BODY CARE HEALTH DASCHLE EDUCATIONAL ARM CALIFORNIA PROBATION OFFICER WITH. A REGISTERED MARK. AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OKAY. IN ADDITION TO MY DID YOU THE EXACT CORRECT THE EDUCATIONAL. MISTER ENRIGHT YOUR SOUNDS CHANGED I DON'T KNOW WE HEARD YOU CLEARLY FOR THE FIRST THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW MAYBE WE'LL HAVE YOU PROJECTED SOUNDS MUFFLED. BARROWCLOUGH OPTO BETTER SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED THAT. WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE ON THE VERY LAST PERSON THAT VERY LONG AFTER. EVERYBODY THOUGHT. BOB PLEASE CONTINUE OKAY I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROBLEM FOR NURSING HOMES TO PAY FOR SHORTAGES EVEN BEFORE THE CABINET NINETEEN PANDEMIC SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WAS STRUGGLING TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED NURSING STAFF IN TWENTY NINETEEN PRIOR TO THE PENT UP BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY STATE AGENCIES ESTIMATED THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED TWENTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT FOR THE UPCOMING YEARS. AFTER TWO YEARS OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE INCREASED. EXACERBATED THE STAFFING SHORTAGE CRISIS TO CRISIS PROPORTIONS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE DOC OF THE PROBATION INDICATE. THREE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED SAN I'VE FOUGHT THE PROFESSION IN TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THE FACT THAT WITH ONLY INTENSIFIED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST A 100% GOVERNMENT FUNDED. MOST FACILITIES RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY PROGRAM. THE GOVERNMENT PAYMENTS FUND WAGES FOR NURSING STAFF WERE SUPPORT STAFF PROVIDING NON NURSING SERVICES. PAYMENT FOR OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDING UTILITIES SUPPLIES AND FOOD FOR RESIDENTS AND RENT TO COVER THE HOUSE HOUSING AROUND. THE CURRENT LACK OF STAFF AVAILABILITY AND I THINK IS THE FOLLOWING IT VERY CURRENT. PROVIDERS ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO ACCEPT PATIENTS TO THEIR INABILITY TO MEET THE REGULATED STAFFING HOURS NURSING HOME CENSUS WILL NOT RETURN TO PRE PANDEMIC RIGHT INTO FACT THAT COMPUTERS CAN BE BUILT- THANK THIS REMAINED EIGHT POINT 7% BELOW DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN. PROVIDERS ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT NEW RECRUITS TO THE SECTOR DUE TO CULVERT MAKING FARES FOR WAGES LACK OF ITS REAR DANCE MEANT. PROVIDERS OF LOSING FIFTEENTH AFTER THE ACUTE HOSPITAL STAFFING AGENCIES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE SETTINGS RELATED TO HIGHER WAGES AND BENEFITS PACKAGES BEING OFFERED MEASURES TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT WORKFORCE ISSUES A LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. NUMBER ONE CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT WAGES MUST INCREASE. THEIR ABILITY DIRECT CARE STAFF OF PIVOTAL IN THE DELIVERY OF QUALITY CARE. CAP NUMBERS ARE INDEBTED AND GRATEFUL TO THE CERTIFIED NURSING HEALTH. CARE FOR THE ELDERLY THE RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE. CNA'S WITH THE WAGES BECAUSE LIKE THE SKILLED CARE THEY PROVIDE TO THE STATE BECAUSE RESIDENTS. THIS REQUIRES THAT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FUNDS PASSED THROUGH A WAY TO INCREASE INVESTMENTS AND CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT MUST CONTINUE TO BE ENHANCE. THE STATE NEEDS TO PRIORITIZE RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING OF NURSING FACILITIES STAFF AS- IT MOVED TO INVESTMENT FUTURE WORK CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT THIS INVESTMENT NURSING FACILITIES WILL CONTINUE TO LACK OF STAFF NEEDED TO PROVIDE HIGHLY SKILLED CARE TO OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE SENIORS. CAN OFTEN SUGGESTING FIFTEEN PROGRAM TO EXPAND FUNDED SUPPORT RECRUITMENT RETENTION SOLUTION TO INCREASE THE CNA LPN AND. RN WORKFORCE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. VERY MUCH OF THE COMMITTEE'S FROM THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS WITH CNA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION WE'RE PLEASED AND EXCITED ABOUT THIS FUNDING AND HOW IT WILL IMPACT THE NAY TRAINING SCHOLARSHIPS WE LIKE THE PROGRAM INCREASE IN BONDS INTEGRATION. NUMBER THREE THREE NEEDS ME TO BE PROFESSIONAL I'VE BEEN GIVEN A CAREER LADDER OPTION. YOU NEED TO STORE WE'VE BEEN VIEWED AS ENTRY LEVEL WORKERS ARE FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR UPSKILLING LITTLE RECOGNITION OF THE FANSEDGE CATION OF FIELD TRAINING AND LACK OF COMPENSATION TO REFLECT WORK EXPERIENCE OR SKILLS THAT. APPELLEES TO PROFESSIONAL I'VE SEEN A WORKFORCE THEY NEED TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WOULD BEST BE REPRESENTED AND OVERSEEN BY LICENSE FOR. THE CURRENT NURSING HOME STAFFING CRISIS LIKE NOTHING I'VE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE FORTY PLUS YEARS REGISTERED NURSE. THE CRISIS CANNOT BE SOLVED WITHOUT THE COMMITMENT OF THE STATE TO INVEST IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND TO SUPPORT THE FIELD. TO INCREASING STOP WHICH IS. NUMBER STRONG SUPPORT THESE BASKETBALL COMMITTING I'M FINE HI AND EFFORTS. TOWARDS IMPROVEMENT WORKFORCE TODAY'S. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE AMBIENT MINISTRATION TO SOLVE WORKFORCE CRISIS I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND EVERYTHING TO BE DONE FIRST SO FAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR QUESTIONS- I'M GONNA BEGIN. I'M I'M STRUCK AND I WILL. THISFIRST QUESTION IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE'VE HISTORICALLY HAD A 95% REIMBURSEMENT FOR SMITH LABOR COSTS WITH OUR MEDIC CAL RATES THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NOT. A 100% WHAT'S THE LOGIC FOR US FOR MAINTAINING IT AT 95% RATHER THAN. COVERING THE TRUE LABOR COSTS. ARAMBULA LINDY HARRINGTON DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH CARE- FINANCING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SERVICING. DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF LONG TERM FINANCING STABILITY FOR THE HEALTH OF THE MEDIC HOW PROGRAMS AND IT IS ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF CALLIE AND TO HAVE A FOCUS ON TRANSFORMING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THROUGH VALUE BASED INITIATIVES MODERNIZATION AND PAYMENT REFORM TO FURTHER THIS FOCUS AND DEPARTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO PERFORM REIMBURSEMENT FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT RECOGNIZES BOTH COST AND INCENTIVIZES QUALITY WHILE MAINTAINING FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF PUBLIC FUNDS. THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IS GOVERNED BY STATUTE THAT ESTABLISHED AT THAT PROCESS FOR DETERMINING THE ANNUAL RATE INCREASES WHICH ARE CURRENTLY CAPPED AT TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT. AND IS PART OF THAT PROCESS IT DOES CAP THE PERCENTILE OF LABOR COSTS THAT ARE INCLUDED SO IF A FACILITIES LABOR COSTS ARE ABOVE THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE IT IS CAPS- AT THAT NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE FOR INCLUSION IN THE OVERALL CALCULATION SO IT DOESN'T. ONLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 95% OF THE FACILITIES LABOR COSTS IT ONLY IT CAPS AT THAT NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE. AB ADDITIONALLY- STATUTE PROVIDES AUTHORITY FOR THE QUALITY INITIAL ALL RIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PROGRAM DON'T EXPOSTO WHICH IS INTENDED TO REWARD FACILITIES FOR THEIR QUALITY OUTCOMES. AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE ONE OF VERY FEW PROVIDER TYPES THAT RECEIVE AN ANNUAL RATE INCREASE- AND THE DEPARTMENT AS WE WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON ENGAGING WHAT. NEXT ITERATION OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES LOOKS LIKE AND HAVE AND YOU KNOW DISCUSS A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD UPDATE. THAT METHODOLOGY TO HAVE A SEPARATE- BUDGETARY GROW LIMIT FOR COSTS VERSUS OTHER KIND OF IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF LABOR COST. AND THE FACT THAT THEY GROW IN A DIFFERENT RATE THAN OTHER CATEGORIES AND ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT'S GOAL IS TO IMPROVE UPON THE QUALITY PROGRAM BY MOVING AWAY FROM A PERCENTILE. I'M PROGRAM TO A THRESHOLD PROGRAM SO IT'S A FACILITY MEETS OUR QUALITY THRESHOLD ALL FACILITIES ARE INCENTIVIZED TO IMPROVE QUALITY VERSUS JUST THOSE THAT ARE AT THE VERY TOP. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT CONVERSATION IT HAS BEEN A LONG RUNNING CONVERSATION. BUT THE CONCERNS MANY OF US HAVE IS A FOR NOT FULLY REIMBURSING THE LABOR COSTS. ARE WE GOING TO HAVE THE ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE STAFFING WHICH WE HEARD TO SOME NECESSARY WITHIN OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. I'D LIKE TO NOW MOVES TO THE QUESTION THAT- NICOLE HOWELL HAD ASKED ABOUT THE CNA PROGRAM TRAINING. AND THE NECESSITY FOR US TO HAVE AN R. AND LEAD AND THEIR INABILITY TO FIND A DIRECTOR AT THE US FAR- IT. PROBABLY SHOULDN'T ASK BUT EITHER TO ELIZABETH HALIFAX ARE CLEAR IN RIGHT YOU BOTH SET YOU ARE OUR ENDS HOW DO WE ENSURE- WE EITHER FIND A DIRECTOR OR DO WE NEED TO CONTINUE HAVING IN OUR AND LEAD THIS CNA PROGRAM. I'VE ACTUALLY DONE THAT BOB MILLER PRIOR LIFE. BOB AND WILL CONSIDER DOING IT AGAIN BUT I HAVEN'T. POINT THIRTY FIVE. I THINK THERE ARE ARE IS. AND IF THEY'RE NOT READY FOR IT YET THEY ARE STILL WORKING OUT THERE AND THEY'RE IN THEIR- I THINK THAT IN. AT. COULD IT BE DONE BY AND ON OUR END I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR OPPORTUNITY AND GROWTH YEAH AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS NEED TO BE A REGISTERED NURSE. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT THEIR TAKE ON THAT QUESTION. I BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE FOUR CD P. H. AND THEY'RE NOT HERE SO HE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT QUESTION FOR THEM AT ANOTHER TIME. I'M MY FINAL QUESTION CLEAR AND RIGHT HAD STATED THAT. WE ARE TWENTY THOUSAND CNA'S DOWN I'VE HEARD RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS THAT I'VE LISTED IT AS HIGH AS TEN THOUSAND C. N. A.'S. GIVEN THIS HOW MUCH WILL THIS YEAR'S CURRENT INVESTMENT HELP US TO CLOSE THAT GAP AND WHAT MORE DOES THE STATE NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTAGE. I CAN. CAN TO ENSURE THAT SO- WE BELIEVE THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE INVESTMENTS WILL ASSISTANCE TO TRAIN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TEENAGE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS I MEAN WE'RE LOOKING AT- HOPEFULLY BEING ABLE TO TRAIN SEVERAL THOUSAND- WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IN INVESTING IN THE OTHER PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BUYERS STAKEHOLDERS ARE KIND OF EASY TO THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF BUILDING THE CLEAR AWARENESS- AND SUPPORT OF THE FACULTY AND THE TRAINING SUPERVISORS TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN- AND SO. WE JUST RECOGNIZE IT IS THAT INTENTION AS EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF TRAININGBUT ALSO BUILDING THAT CAREER AWARENESS- AS WE HEARD IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND- IN SOME. RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS WORK TO ADD THAT IS GOOD WORK TO DO- SO THE PRIORITIES THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PERSONNEL- WITH THE EXISTING FUNDING BUT WE HAVE REALLY WANTED TO UPLIFT THE COMMENTS OF NICOLE HOW AGAIN I WAS IMPRESSED IN TWENTY NINETEEN HEARING YOU AND AGAIN TODAY ABOUT HOW YOU'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING OUT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. AND HOW IT REALLY IS THE WRAPAROUND HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT ALLOWED YOU TO HAVE SUCCESS WITH THE STUDENTS WHO WENT THROUGH YOUR PROGRAM. TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOPEFULLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER CNA PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE GROWING. WITH THAT I WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL OF PANEL TWELVE AND ALL OF OUR PANELISTS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED TODAY. WE WILL HAVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEREFORE I WANT TO URGE YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AS BRIEF AS YOU CAN SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE. WE WILL START WITH IN PERSON PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE HEARING ROOM IF YOU CAN PLEASE COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT. GOOD EVENING. SHARE. KIND OF GOT OFF AN AWFUL SITUATION WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORTABLE LAID OUT THE MOVIE CARE CONNING WORKHORSE PACKAGES EACH POSTAL ADDRESSES CRITICAL NEEDS AN ORAL CARE WORKFORCE ESTATE ARE REVERSES DOWN 20% AND IT WOULD TAKE YEARS TO WORK OUR WAY BACK. ENTER THE INTENTIONAL FOCUS TO RECRUIT TRAIN RETAIN AND RETRAIN DIFFERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES WILL HELP ENSURE OUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. KEEP MOVING. THE- THE RECALL. THANK YOU I WON'T RESTORE. MOVING TO JIMMY CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY IS THE HOME THE SECOND LARGEST NUMBER OF TEACHING HOSPITALS AND RESIDENTS IN THE COUNTRY WHAT CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS APPRECIATE THE VARIOUS GME PROGRAMS EXISTING TODAY THE REALITY IS THE FUNDING DOESN'T COVER THE COSTS. OF THESE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE OUR PRIVATE IN DISTRICT HOSPITALS DO NOT RECEIVEMEDIC CAL GME FUNDING TO SUPPORT THEIR WORK WE APPRECIATE THE COMMUNITY THE COMMITTEES FOCUSED ON OVERSIGHT- HOWEVER THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NEED AN ONGOING INVESTMENT OTHERWISE WE WILL AS WE RECOVER FROM CODED THERE WILL BE LESS GME PROGRAMS AVAILABLE AND LASTLY RELATED TO THE CIGARETTE TAX FOR SMALL RURAL HOSPITALS WE APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION OF THE TWENTY THIRTY SEISMIC STANDARDS ARE OUT ARE OUT OF TOUCH IN OUT OF REACH FOR HOSPITALS. NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF OUR HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THAT STANDARD INCLUDING THE FIFTY SMALLER RURAL HOSPITALS AT AN ESTIMATED HUNDRED BILLION AS REFERENCE FOR THE CHAIR WE MUST CONSIDER MODERNIZING THIS PROPOSAL TO PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS SERVICES NEED TO START NEEDED SERVICES POST DISASTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD EVENING CHAIR- MEMBER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I AM CRISTINA BOSS HAMILTON I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR ADULT DAY SERVICES AND- ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE CARICOM TO ME THAT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN TODAY'S HEARING BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION ARE THE DIRECT CARE WORKERS WHO WORK FOR THE ADULT THE HEALTH CARE AND ADULT THE PROGRAMS. AROUND THE STATE THE SAME WORK FORCE CRISES THAT EXIST IN THESE OTHER AREAS ALSO EXIST NEEDS FACILITIES- I DO YOU KNOW WANT TO CALL ATTENTION THAT CATS IS REQUESTING SIXTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME BUDGET FUNDING SPECIFICALLY- IT COULD BE USED FOR ONE OF TWO PURPOSES ONE BEING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THE OTHER BEING WORK FORCE RESILIENCY- SPECIFICALLY TO BE ABLE TO STABILIZE. THE SHORTAGE THAT RIGHT NOW IS KEEPING A LOT OF THE CENTERS FROM OPERATING A FULL CUP CAPACITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SIMILAR STAFFING REQUIREMENTS THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IF PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING SERVED IN THOSE SETTINGS IN THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE IN NURSING HOMES AND SO IF WE WANT TO KEEP THEM IN THE COMMUNITY WE NEED THOSE DOORS OPEN AND THAT MEANS HAVING. STAFFING APPROPRIATE SAID THAT IN A VERY- KEEN EXAMPLE IS THE COST OF HIRING A TEMPORARY OUR END BECAUSE ARE HAVING IN OUR AND ON STAFF IS A REQUIREMENT CAN BE UPWARD OF EIGHTY DOLLARS PER HOUR AND- FACILITIES ARE ONLY WERE REIMBURSED SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS PER DAY PER RECIPIENT SO THERE IS A NEED JUST AS MUCH THERE IN TERMS OF- ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE WE DO WANNA. PROMOTED TO THE SUB ONE INTO THE SUB OF FOR COMMITTEES TO. PLEASE LOOK INTO IN SUPPORT THE SIXTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION I WOULD ALSO JUST LEAVE WITH IT IS VERY MUCH DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. AND THEREFORE- IF THE LEGISLATURE AGREES WOULD BE EXEMPT- SPENDING UNDER THE STATE CAN LIMIT THANK YOU.

RIGHTS TO CHOOSE- AND THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO COMMENT ON WAS. JUST THE SORT OF REOCCURRING THEME- THAT TOOK PLACE THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING ABOUT THE STAFFING SHORTAGES IN THE HEALTH CARE- AND MEDICAL CARE INDUSTRY AND I DO FIND IT FASCINATING THAT NO ONE HAS OTHER THAN A COUPLE OF ASTUTE COMMENTERS. HAVE BROACHED AT THE- SUBJECT OF. THE FIRING AND STRONG ARMING AND BASICALLY TEAR ANALYZING OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO DON'T WANT THIS COLBERT SHOT CALIFORNIA AND MOVING TO A FREE STATE FOR GETTING BONUSES IN PLACES LIKE NEBRASKA AND FLORIDA TO GO WORK BEAR IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY SO.
