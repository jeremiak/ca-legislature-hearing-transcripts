YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS NOT A

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:23.055
OF AN ISSUE THAT I'VE I'VE

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:23.855
DREAMED UP IT'S IT'S REALLY AN

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.624
ISSUE OF OF GETTING COMPETENT

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:28.360
PEOPLE -- THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE

THAT PHARMACY INTO CONTROL.

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:35.901
OF THE MANY NUANCES THAT COULD

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:37.102
HAPPEN IN THE PHARMACY PHARMACY

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:38.637
LAWS VERY COMPLICATED BOTH AT

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:39.504
THE STATE LEVEL ON THE FEDERAL

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.706
LEVEL AND ALL THAT

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.274
RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ON THE

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:42.975
PHARMACIST IN CHARGE WHETHER R

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:43.542
NOT.

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:44.643
THEY'RE EVEN AT THE PHARMACY IF

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.877
IT'S A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PHARMACY

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:47.279
IN A VIOLATION OCCURS AT TWO

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:50.882
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE

00:20:50.949 --> 00:20:53.151
PHARMACIST IN CHARGE GET CITED.

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:53.752
IF YOU CAN DONATE ACTIVITY IN

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:54.853
SHE IS SHOWN THEY GAVE DIRECTION

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.454
TO DISOBEY THE LAW HE DESERVES

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.321
TO BE CITED AS THE PHARMACIST IN

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:57.122
CHARGE.

00:20:57.189 --> 00:20:58.724
BUT BUT I THINK THE BEST THING

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.158
TO DO IS TO HEAR FROM THOSE

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:01.693
PHARMACISTS THAT.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.928
ARE REFRAIN FROM BIG PHARMACISTS

CHARGES KNOWS OF AN

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:06.465
INAPPROPRIATELY SIDE.

00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:08.900
I APPRECIATE THAT -- AND AND I

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:09.468
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE NICE

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:10.769
THINGS ABOUT.

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:11.837
I'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE THE

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:13.038
LEGISLATURE WE ALL HAVE

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.206
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES IN LIFE

00:21:14.272 --> 00:21:15.741
THAT WE BRING TO THE ARE

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.643
LAWMAKING PROCESS BECAUSE THAT

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.077
THAT'S REALLY WHAT MAKES GOOD

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:20.646
LOSS RIGHT AND AND MAKES GOOD

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.381
JUDGMENTS IS THAT WE WE SEE AND

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:23.515
FEEL THAT EXPERIENCE.

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:24.950
CERTAINLY THAT ALSO COMES FROM

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:26.551
THE WITNESSES THAT COME AND

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:27.786
TESTIFY BEFORE US.

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.621
I'M SO WHAT I I THINK FOR ME AT

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:30.689
LEAST THAT WHERE I'D BE A LITTLE

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.357
BIT MORE COMFORTABLE IN MOVING

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:34.026
THIS BILL IS THAT IF WE WE ASK

00:21:34.092 --> 00:21:36.228

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:40.699
CAREFUL LOOK AT THE EXTENT TO

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:41.833
WHICH THIS IS A PROBLEM AND

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.403
INFORM US. TO WHAT THEY FIND

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:45.671

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:47.205
LEAST PROVIDE A BETTER

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:48.674
FOUNDATION AND WHICH HAD. TO

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.242

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:26.578
LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE

RATHER THAN JUST THE ATTACKS

00:22:28.213 --> 00:22:29.481
FINE CHANGE.

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:31.183
WITHOUT A REAL CAREFUL

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:32.617

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:25.837
GOOD APPROACH -- AND IT MIGHT

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:26.905
THE SOLUTION AND THE SANCTION

MAY NOT JUST BE FINANCIAL IT

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:28.573

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.641
RESTRICTIONS IT COULD BE PLACED

ON THEIR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.677
IN SOME CASES SO I THINK THAT'S

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.546
A GOOD APPROACH TO HAVE THE THE

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:35.680
BOARD OF PHARMACEUTICAL.

00:23:35.747 --> 00:23:37.516

SENATOR STONE.

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:52.264
THAT MANY OF THESE LARGE

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.166
CORPORATIONS TO SEE IT AS A COST

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:56.401
OF DOING BUSINESS AND SO IF IT'S

00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:57.302
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY'LL DO

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:58.370

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:19.424
LONG I THINK TWO YEARS MIGHT BE

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:20.992
A LITTLE BIT TOO LONG IF THERE'S

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:22.561

SO THEN WE CAN ACT QUICKLY

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.604
BECAUSE I THINK TWO YEARS WOULD

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:33.738
BE TOO LONG.

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:37.475

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:01.233
BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS IF YOU

00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:03.802
HAVE A SMALL SMALL PHARMACY OWN

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:06.304
PHARMACISTS TO MAKE THE MISTAKE.

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.173
THAT COULD PUT THAT PHARMACIST

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.674
OUT OF BUSINESS ENTIRELY WELL IF

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:10.709
THEY MAKE A MISTAKE IT DOESN'T

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:12.310
MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO GET FINED

00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:13.678
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IS FOR

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:15.347
NOT FOLLOWING PHARMACY LAWS IN

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:16.348
EXAMPLE.

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:17.415
THERE'S A CERTAIN RACIAL

00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:18.650
PHARMACY TECHS THAT YOU CAN HAVE

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.118
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW SO IF

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.920
YOU'RE A SOLE PROPRIETOR LIKE I

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:23.355
AM A COMPOUNDING PHARMACY.

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:24.556
AND I DECIDE I'M GONNA HAVE SIX

00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:26.324
TAX WORKING BECAUSE I NEED TO

00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:27.659
GET THE VOLUME AT A ONE IRON OF

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:29.160
THE PHARMACIST AND THEY SHOULD

00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:30.328
BE APPROPRIATELY CHARGE.

00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:32.297
HOWEVER IT'S UP TO FIFTY

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:33.131
THOUSAND DOLLARS I DON'T THINK

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.432

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:38.770
VERY VERY SERIOUS.

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:40.272
SO IT'S LIKELY THAT THAT WOULD

00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:42.340
NOT HAPPEN TO A SOLE PROPRIETOR

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:43.975

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:34.217
A PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW OUR

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:35.719
PATIENTS ON CALL JUST TO TEAM UP

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:37.087

I'M AN EXAMPLE OUR PROGRAM HAS

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:46.363
BEEN CREATED IN NEW MEXICO WHERE

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.372
SB SIX FIFTY IN THIS REPORT WILL

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:56.706
BE A STEP TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.408
CURRENT PROGRAM IS NOT WORKING

00:52:58.475 --> 00:52:59.476
FOR CANCER PATIENTS.

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:01.478

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:02.212
IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:03.313

THE SUPERVISION RATIO FROM FOUR

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:19.862

YOU SACRAMENTO FOR FOR BRING

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:43.886
THIS FORD EIGHT NOW I THINK IT

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:45.220
MAKES SOME VERY IMPORTANT STEPS

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:48.223
IN TERMS OF UPDATING THE AYE

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:49.158
GUIDELINES.

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:50.926
ON PS I I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:53.028
ABOUT THE SUPERVISION RATIO

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.129
CHANGE.

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:57.065
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE MAY MAY NOT

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:58.767
REALIZE THAT -- FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:02.104
RATIO -- FOUR TO ONE COMES FROM --

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.906
ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:05.073
LOOKING AT HOW MANY --

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:08.143
PHYSICIANS A A SO IN RESIDENCY

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.378
TRAINING I WAS THE REST OF THE

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:11.180
TRAIN DIRECTOR -- WE WERE NOT

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:16.118
PERMITTED -- TO SURPRISE MORE

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:17.085
THAN.

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:17.753
FOUR FOR PRESENTS HIS ACTIONS AT

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.154
A TIME AND AND STILL BELT

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.389
MEDICARE AND THAT WAS THE CMS

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:21.557
GUIDELINES.

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.559
AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW I I

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:24.760
DO THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:25.994
SOME MORE CONSIDERS SOME

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:27.663
CONSIDERATION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:30.065
IS THAT NUMBER IN THE END --

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.433
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEN YOU'RE

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:32.968
JUST A NAME ON A PIECE OF PAPER

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:34.369
IT'S NOT SUPER VISION ISN'T

01:14:34.436 --> 01:14:35.537
ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND I THINK

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:36.738
WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.240
SOME PREVIOUS HEARINGS.

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:39.107
I THINK AT NE POINT DOES

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:40.876
PROPOSAL THAT WELL SINCE YOU

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:42.811
COULD DO FOR YOU COULD DO FOR IN

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:43.879
SEASON FOUR PA'S NOW YOU NOW CAN

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:45.414
SUPERVISE TWELVE PEOPLE ON

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.481
REALISTICALLY.

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:47.349
AS SOMEONE WHO'S HAD PASSED THE

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:48.684
SUPERVISORS AT SHE HAD TO

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.153
SUPERVISE -- OTHER UP SPECIALS

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.823
PARTICULARLY ACTUALLY INCLUDING

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:55.924
OTHER PHYSICIANS.

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:56.525
THERE'S A CERTAIN POINT WHERE

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:57.192
YOU'RE NOT REALLY ABLE TO TRULY

01:14:57.259 --> 01:15:00.662
SUPERVISE AND AND AND AND AND SO --

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:02.064
THAT IS AN AREA THAT I DO HAVE

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:04.566
SOME CONCERNS -- BECAUSE THE FOR

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.168
DEBT IF THERE'S A BASIS FOR THE

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.736
FOR SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:09.104
BASIS FOR THE SIXES.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:12.407
AND BEING SURE THAT -- THAT WE

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:14.042
HAVE SOME.

01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:14.676
BECAUSE THIS THAT DOESN'T ONLY

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:17.112
AFFECT THIS BILL RIGHT WITH P.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:18.981
A.'S BUT ALSO THEN START TALKING

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.449
ABOUT WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS RATIO

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.150
AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS.

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:23.719
EXACTLY WHAT IS THE WORKLOAD

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:26.421
EXPECTED OF THE SUPERVISOR AND

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:27.923
TO BE SURE THAT THERE IS

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:29.558
ADEQUATE SUPERVISION.

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.126
AND THAT WE MAINTAIN PATIENT

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.961
SAFETY SO I MEAN I I SUPPORT

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:33.929
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.497
THE BILL AND THE OTHER

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.499
PROVISIONS I THINK YOU KNOW IT

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:39.234
AGAIN MAKES SENSE -- BUT I WANT

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.270
TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHERE WE'RE

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:43.305
GOING TO GO ON THE RATIO -- SO

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.439
IS THE FORD THERE WAS A

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.942
RATIONALE FOR THAT -- THE SIX

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:49.378
I'D BE I'D APPRECIATE HAVING --

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:52.180
MORE DATA OR EVIDENCE AS TO WHY

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:53.882
SIX IS OKAY AND AMOUNT OF WHAT

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.350
THE WORKLOAD EXPECTED AS A

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:56.785
SUPERVISOR EXAMPLE AT SIX IS A

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:57.920
SURPRISED AND NOT DO ANY

01:15:57.986 --> 01:15:59.421
CLINICAL WORK SO THAT I CAN

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:01.623
ACTUALLY ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE --

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:02.791
THAT'S GONNA BE IT SHOULD BE A

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:05.227
QUESTION SO WE DON'T WANT TO

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:05.928
HAVE SOMEONE SPENDING ALL THE

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:06.595
TIME.

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:07.262
AND THEN THEY'RE NOT SUPERVISING

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:09.431
RIGHT SO EXACTLY WHAT IS THE

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:10.332
EXPECTATION THAN OF THE

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.534
SUPERVISOR OF WHEN YOU HAVE SIX

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:13.568
PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.370
TRACK OF AND ALL THE PATIENTS

01:16:15.437 --> 01:16:16.438
ARE TO IF IT'S REALLY ALL THE

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:17.639
PATIENTS ARE TAKING CARE OF ME

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:18.740
AND SHOULD BE SURE THAT YOU.

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:25.847
CAN REVIEW AND BE SURE THAT YOU

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:26.481
KNOW THINGS ARE BEING MISSED AND

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:26.748
SO FORTH.

01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:31.086
WITH PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR --

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:32.721
SWIMBAIT THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:34.856
IN THIS BILL IS TAKING DECISIONS

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:35.457
THAT ARE MADE AT THE PRACTICE

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:37.859
LEVEL -- THAT ARE OW DICTATED

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.494
BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:40.629
THE PRACTICE LEVEL.

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:41.964
AND SAYING.

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:43.198
IF YOU SEEN ONE PRACTICE YOU

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.700
SEEN ONE PRACTICE WE'RE ALL

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.234
DIFFERENT -- WE ALL HAVE

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:47.469
DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS AND WE

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:50.038
ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS FOR

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.440
MEETING PATIENT NEEDS.

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.775
AND SO MUCH OF THE FLEXIBILITY

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:56.178
IN THIS BILL COMES.

01:16:56.244 --> 01:16:57.713
TO THE PRESS IT TO THE PRACTICE

01:16:57.779 --> 01:17:01.083
LEVEL TO PUT IN.

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.583
THOSE.

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:03.719
SIGN DOCUMENTS THIS IS WHAT YOU

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:07.122
MAY DO AND WHAT YOU MAY NOT DO.

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:09.057
IN IN PASSING THAT FROM THE

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:11.159
STATE TO THE PRACTICE WE HAD

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:12.961
MANY DISCUSSIONS -- WITH THE

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.663
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND WITH

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:17.799
OTHERS ABOUT WHAT FLEXIBILITY IN

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:19.267
TERMS OF THOSE RATIOS OUGHT TO

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:22.871
BE -- AT MY I'M NOT GIVING AWAY

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.473
ANY SECRETS MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:26.041
SAID WE ARE ON RECORD AS HAVING

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:29.244
SUPPORTING ONE TO SIX RATIO --

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:30.946
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE P.

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:33.582
A COMMUNITY WOULD LIKE WE'RE ON

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:36.151
THAT SAME PAGE IT DOES NOT MEAN

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:37.486
THAT A PRACTICE THAT ALL

01:17:37.552 --> 01:17:39.488
PRACTICES ARE IMMEDIATELY GOING

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.056
TO GO TO A ONE SIX RATIONS.

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:43.225
SOME MAY BE A ONE TO ONE RATIO

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:44.693
SOME MAY BE WE HAVE A NEW

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.894
PHYSICIAN.

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:47.696
AND WE DON'T FEEL THAT THAT

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:50.332
POSITION SHOULD BE SUPERVISING

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:51.166
ANY.

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:53.035
WE HAVE A NEW P. A. N. WE THINK

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:55.137
THAT THAT P. A. SHOULD BE VERY

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.838
CAREFULLY SUPERVISED IN DE.

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:58.340
THAT ENDED CERTAINLY.

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:00.509
I THINK THIS IS AN HOUR LIMIT

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:01.643
RIGHT SO I WAS EACH PRACTICE

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.178
SITUATION BUT I THINK THERE'S A

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:04.579
CERTAIN POINT WHERE THAT OUR

01:18:04.646 --> 01:18:06.748
LIMIT -- WE NEED TO FIGURE OT

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.917
WHERE THAT LINE IS BECAUSE

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:09.551
OTHERWISE THEN YOU ARE TO USE

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:10.185
THAT YOU AND I MEAN THAT'S THE

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:11.787
SITUATION THAT'S REASON WHY CMS

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:12.788
HAD THOSE GUIDELINES.

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:14.956
THEY SAID WE REALLY WANT YOU WE

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:15.857
DO KNOW.

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:17.459
THAT PROTECT PATIENTS WE NEED TO

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:21.563
BE SURE TO ACTUAL SUPERVISION

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:22.164
GOING ON SO THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.198
SOME -- EXAMINATION OF EXACTLY

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:24.332
HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES TO

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:26.334
SUPERVISE EVEN AT THAT HOUR

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:27.702
LIMIT SO THAT.

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.604
ACTUALLY THERE IS APPROPRIATE

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:31.139
PATIENT SAFETY SAFEGUARDS IN

01:18:31.206 --> 01:18:32.140
PLACE AND I THINK CERTAINLY

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:32.774
THAT'S ROLE FOR THIS COMMITTEE

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:34.843
SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE A RACIAL

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:35.844
THE FIRST PLACE ALWAYS WOULD

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:38.180
JUST SAY FOR WHATEVER BUT AND

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:38.814
AND SO I THINK.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.714
WE'LL.

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:41.683
IT'D BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A BETTER

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.652
IDEAAS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:18:43.718 --> 01:18:45.520
HOW WE STAB WISH THAT NUMBER --

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:47.022
SO IS THAT THERE WAS A RATIONALE

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:49.291
FOR THE ONE FOUR ONE CAN ARGUE

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:50.959
HOW GOOD OF A RATIONALE BUT

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.094
WE'RE GOING TO THAT ONE THE SIX

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:52.794
I MEAN BEEN SOMEONE'S GONNA

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:54.830
PROPOSE.

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:56.331
ONE EIGHT ON THE TEN AT WHAT PUT

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:56.531
YELP.

01:18:56.598 --> 01:18:58.066
SO AND AND REALIZE ALSO THE

01:18:58.133 --> 01:18:58.834
OTHER THING THIS BILL DOES IT

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.535
SERVE DECREASES SOME OF THE I

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:01.436
GUESS ALL PAPERWORK WORKLOAD

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.105
RIGHT SIGNING STUFF LIKE THAT SO.

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:04.406
BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUAL

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:05.907
SUPERVISION I WANT TO BE SURE

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:13.815
THAT WE ESTABLISHED RATIOS THAT

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:14.382
ARE THAT WILL STILL PROTECT

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:16.351
PATIENTS.

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:17.018
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.487
THE COMMITTEE.

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:19.855
OUT LAWCENTER COVER I REMEMBER

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:21.857

HEAVY LEFT IT SEEMS LIKE

01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:27.596
TECHNICAL AND SMALL BUT DISCOVER

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:28.630
PRAXIS IS CAN BE VERY VERY

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:29.764

THE THAT WAY SEE IS IS THAT --

01:50:28.521 --> 01:50:30.857
OTHER PLACES WHERE WE IN TERMS

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:32.392
OF ACCESS MY TIME UNDER SING

01:50:32.459 --> 01:50:34.561
HOMES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:50:34.627 --> 01:50:35.895
SCHOOLS SO BUT NOW I'VE MAKE

01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:37.964
NOTE THAT.

01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:39.332
I THINK A. B. BUT THAT VAST

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:40.433
MAJORITY OF OUR NURSING HOME

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:41.067
PATIENTS ACTUALLY ARE ON THAT A

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:43.236
CAL SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:44.337
JUST THE SO OVERALL WE WERE

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:45.405
ABOUT THIRD PEOPLE MEDI CAL BUT

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:46.206
HALF OF ALL CHILDREN.

01:50:46.272 --> 01:50:48.241
EVEN HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE

01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:49.709
IN NURSING HOME CARE SO I GUESS

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:50.477
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I DO HAVE

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:50.844
IS.

01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:51.978
HITTING A 30% THRESHOLD SHOULD

01:50:52.045 --> 01:50:53.380
BE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR

01:50:53.446 --> 01:50:54.514
SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY PROVIDING

01:50:54.581 --> 01:50:55.648
CARE IN THOSE SETTINGS IS THERE

01:50:55.715 --> 01:51:01.988
A PROBLEM WITH THE 3% THRESHOLD

01:51:02.055 --> 01:51:04.758
AND SO CITY HA IS CONCERNED WITH

01:51:04.824 --> 01:51:06.993
THE THRESHOLD.

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.561
IS THAT IT REALLY -- SETS A

01:51:08.628 --> 01:51:09.829
PRECEDENT NO OTHER.

01:51:09.896 --> 01:51:11.131
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IS MANDATED

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:14.367
BY THE STATE TO HAVE A CERTAIN

01:51:14.434 --> 01:51:15.168
PACE ELATION BUT BUT JUST BUT

01:51:15.235 --> 01:51:16.903
JUST TO CLARIFY THIS ONLY

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:19.272
APPLIES.

01:51:19.339 --> 01:51:22.342
IN NON HIP SAID AREAS TO SOMEONE

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:24.411
SO RIGHT NOW.

01:51:24.477 --> 01:51:25.412

PERCENTAGE RIGHT I MEAN IT'S BY

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:36.556
DEFINITION THAT'S A LOW SO.

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:38.191
THIS THIS IS THE PROVISION WHICH

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:39.426
BECAUSE I THINK THERE COULD

01:51:39.492 --> 01:51:44.097
BASICALLY I THINK THERE'S A WILL

01:51:44.164 --> 01:51:46.666
THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIT OF

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:48.201

IT'S FEDERAL.

01:51:58.411 --> 01:51:59.712
THAN -- THEN THEN YOU CAN'T

01:51:59.779 --> 01:52:00.780

TRYING TO STRIKE A MIDDLE GROUND

01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:03.149
HERE BECAUSE I THINK THE PURPOSE

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:04.217
WAS IS AND ACTUALLY THE SAID

01:52:04.284 --> 01:52:05.218

01:52:22.635 --> 01:52:23.536
LANGUAGE.

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:25.271
AND WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE THAT

01:52:25.338 --> 01:52:26.539
CONCERN OF OPENING IT UP THAT

01:52:26.606 --> 01:52:28.241
WOULD MANDATE PROVIDERS SEE A

01:52:28.308 --> 01:52:30.510
CERTAIN PAPER PATIENT

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:32.579
POPULATIONS AWAY TONIGHT CLASS

01:52:32.645 --> 01:52:34.114
WERE BUT WE'RE TOTALLY WILLING

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:34.881
TO WORK WITH THEM ON THAT AND

01:52:34.948 --> 01:52:35.515
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WILLING TO PUT

01:52:35.582 --> 01:52:38.651
THAT THRESHOLD BACK IN THE BILL.

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:43.356
AND AND OKAY SO BECAUSE AFFINITY

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:43.523
SO.

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:45.225
THE ISSUE ISN'T THE PERCENTAGE

01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:47.327
THAT ISSUES THE PROVISION OR THE

01:52:47.393 --> 01:52:48.394
ISSUE THE PERCENTAGE FIGURE OUT

01:52:48.461 --> 01:52:49.662
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE ISSUE AS

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:50.263
A PERCENTAGE OF THAT WE'D ALL

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:51.564
EVERYONE AGREED ON THE PROVISION.

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:52.398
BUT YOUR OBJECTION IS ACTUALLY

01:52:52.465 --> 01:52:53.399
TO HAVING THAT PROVISION THE

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:55.368
FIRST PLACE.

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:56.002
I'M TRYING TO CLARIFY WHAT'S THE

01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:58.371
PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:52:58.438 --> 01:52:59.472
PUTTING IT BACK IN BASICALLY

01:52:59.539 --> 01:53:01.341
DOES OKAY SO THERE IS NOT A IT'S

01:53:01.407 --> 01:53:05.478
NOT CALLED THE PROVISION ISN'T

01:53:05.545 --> 01:53:07.680
THE PROBLEM IT'S THE PERCENTAGE.

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:08.948
OKAY I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:10.016
OKAY AND AND I GUESS I'M RAISING

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:10.617
WHAT'S WRONG 30%.

01:53:10.683 --> 01:53:11.551
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND 30% IS

01:53:11.618 --> 01:53:12.218
MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK THE MORE

01:53:12.285 --> 01:53:13.052
AT THE HIGHER PERCENTAGE YOU

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:14.087
HAVE OF PATIENTS IN YOUR

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:14.687
POPULATION THAT YOU NEED TO

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:16.489
TRACK TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE

01:53:16.556 --> 01:53:17.190
THE RIGHT PATIENT.

01:53:17.257 --> 01:53:18.391
ANY HARD TO TRACK IT WOULD BE

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:19.893
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE HIGH

01:53:19.959 --> 01:53:21.861
JENIS TO TRACK THAT -- THE

01:53:21.928 --> 01:53:23.229
PERCENTAGE SHOULD BE EQUALLY

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:24.797
DIFFICULT ATTRACTION OR WHAT THE

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:26.766
PERCENTAGES I MEAN IN TERMS OF

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:29.936
BY THAT SHE IS THAT PERCENTAGE.

01:53:30.003 --> 01:53:30.737
THAT MAY BE BUT AS A SET OF AT

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:31.971
THE POPULATIONS ARE THE ONES

01:53:32.038 --> 01:53:33.439
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:53:33.506 --> 01:53:35.408
CHILDREN ARE 50% OF MEDI CAL

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:37.377
PATIENTS RIGHTS OF YOU DOING

01:53:37.443 --> 01:53:39.712
SCHOOLS QUESTION BE TO DIFFICULT.

01:53:39.779 --> 01:53:40.847
NURSING HOMES.

01:53:40.914 --> 01:53:44.350
I THINK 80% SO. 30% SHOULD BE NO

01:53:44.417 --> 01:53:46.819
PROBLEM -- WE'RE NOT WE'RE

01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:47.987
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WHY

01:53:48.054 --> 01:53:49.022
HEARING IS MAINLY FOCUSING ON

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:50.156
THOSE AREAS WHERE YOU ACTUALLY

01:53:50.223 --> 01:53:53.126
READY HALF FOR THE BIGGEST

01:53:53.193 --> 01:53:54.661
ACCESS PROBLEMS.

01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:55.461
JERRY HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:53:55.528 --> 01:54:01.401
PERCENTAGE MEDI CAL PATIENTS --

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:03.002
SO I I THINK THAT FOR ME AT THE

01:54:03.069 --> 01:54:03.870
CENTER PAN MAKES A VERY GOOD

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:05.338
POINT LET ME JUST ASK OR

01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:06.339
CLARIFICATION SO.

01:54:06.406 --> 01:54:09.375
FROM CTA'S POINT OF YOU YOU'VE

01:54:09.442 --> 01:54:11.110
RACED. FIVE ISSUES. ONE OF THE

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:13.680
WHICH IS THE THRESHOLD AND FOR

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:14.581
OTHERS BUT IS THE IS YOURS.

01:54:14.647 --> 01:54:15.114
OPPOSITION REMOVAL OF YOUR

01:54:15.181 --> 01:54:15.748
OPPOSITION BASED ON THE

01:54:15.815 --> 01:54:17.050
THRESHOLD CHANGE.

01:54:17.116 --> 01:54:18.384
AND THE OTHERS WITH OUR CONCERNS

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:19.652
THAT YOU THINK ARE YOUR WORKING

01:54:19.719 --> 01:54:21.754
ON WITH THE WITH THE AUTHOR IS

01:54:21.821 --> 01:54:22.922
THAT SO WE'RE WORKING ON IT SO

01:54:22.989 --> 01:54:24.958
WE WE RAISE THREE ISSUES THERE

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:27.260
IS THE DIPSET DESIGNATION --

01:54:27.327 --> 01:54:28.061
THAT THE PERCENTAGE THRESHOLD

01:54:28.127 --> 01:54:30.763
REQUIREMENT THERE IS THE I. T.

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:32.398
R. GENERAL SUPERVISION AND THEN

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:35.134
THERE IS ALSO THE SUPERVISION

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:37.670
FOR LOCAL ANESTHESIA BOTH OF

01:54:37.737 --> 01:54:40.106
WHICH FOR EACH AB IS.

01:54:40.173 --> 01:54:42.008
AN THE THE POSITION OF MOVING

01:54:42.075 --> 01:54:43.943
BACK TO SUPPORT OF AMENDED WAS

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:45.712
BASED ON ADDING THE DIPS A

01:54:45.778 --> 01:54:47.680
INFORMATION -- OR THAT IF THE

01:54:47.747 --> 01:54:48.881
DEFINITION BACK INT THE

01:54:48.948 --> 01:54:50.283

LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:52.752
WORK ON IT BUT IF THE AUTHOR

01:54:52.819 --> 01:54:58.625
MOVED THE THRESHOLD OF 30%.

01:54:58.691 --> 01:54:59.259
BUT THAT REMOVE YOUR OPPOSITION

01:54:59.325 --> 01:54:59.559
[inaudible]

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:01.261
IF.

01:55:01.327 --> 01:55:03.830
IF IT SO THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:55:03.896 --> 01:55:04.631
SHOULD THAT SENATOR CHIANG IS

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:07.166
PUTTING BACK AND WE WILL BE BACK

WITH ELDERLY PATIENTS THAT MAY

01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:25.798
NEED THOSE DEEPER CLEANINGS AND

01:58:25.865 --> 01:58:27.099
LOCAL ANESTHESIA PROVIDES --

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:29.402
PAIN RELIEF WE ARE NOT INCLUDING

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:31.170
THE NITROUS OXIDE OBVIOUSLY

01:58:31.237 --> 01:58:32.472
BECAUSE THAT CHANGES YOUR

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:35.141
CONSCIOUSNESS -- BUT THE LOCAL

01:58:35.208 --> 01:58:37.076
ANESTHESIA WAS A WAY TO ADD

01:58:37.143 --> 01:58:38.511
ADDITIONAL PAIN RELIEF FOR THOSE.

THE IMPORTANCE OF PAIN RELIEF.

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:48.421
HI BUT I'M ALSO CONSCIOUS OF THE

01:58:48.488 --> 01:58:49.889
POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS.

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:52.091
AND A ONE BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:53.826
THAT SCIENTISTS ARE YOU WORKING

01:58:53.893 --> 01:58:56.863
WITH THAT CA ON THAT BECAUSE

01:58:56.929 --> 01:58:58.064
WHAT WE DON'T WANT ANY WE WANTED

01:58:58.130 --> 01:58:59.799

01:58:59.866 --> 01:59:01.334
WE DON'T ALSO WANT TO HAVE

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:02.635
SOMEONE WHO'S OUT THERE.

THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY IN

02:32:15.493 --> 02:32:16.594
TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHEN WE

02:32:24.168 --> 02:32:25.836

02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:29.740
REGARDING THE INCREASED RATIO.

02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:31.175
UPON THE CHANGES SIX TO ONE I

02:32:31.242 --> 02:32:33.177
SENT INSPECTORS TO OBSERVE

02:32:33.244 --> 02:32:35.179
ACTUAL COMMUNITY PHARMACY RATIO

02:32:35.246 --> 02:32:36.981
INCREASES AND WE RARELY SAW

02:32:37.047 --> 02:32:39.750
RATIO ABOVE FOUR TO ONE UTILIZED --

02:32:39.817 --> 02:32:41.852
THIS IS A REMINDER TO THIS BODY

02:32:41.919 --> 02:32:43.087
THAT WE ARE AN ACTING.

02:32:43.153 --> 02:32:44.355
NOW WHAT WE ARE IN ACTING WITH

02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:46.924
SB SIX SEVENTEEN IS STRICTLY

02:32:46.991 --> 02:32:48.692
VOLUNTARY.

02:32:48.759 --> 02:32:50.294
WHAT WE DID SEE WAS AN INCREASE

02:32:50.361 --> 02:32:52.096
IN EXPANDED PHARMACIST SERVICES

02:32:52.162 --> 02:32:54.064
OFFERED A LAST YEAR THE STATE

02:32:54.131 --> 02:32:55.633
REMOVE THE RATIO SO THE

02:32:55.699 --> 02:32:57.368
PHARMACIST COULD CONCENTRATE ON

02:32:57.434 --> 02:32:59.203
THE FULL ARRAY OF PATIENTS

02:32:59.270 --> 02:33:00.538

02:33:00.604 --> 02:33:02.006

CAN BE HELPFUL TO ASSIST.

02:35:58.182 --> 02:36:00.050
NOTHING REPLACES THE SKILLS AND

02:36:00.117 --> 02:36:01.952

THREE TECHNICIANS THAT IS WITH

02:36:20.104 --> 02:36:21.872

02:36:21.939 --> 02:36:23.774
TO ONE RATIO.

02:36:23.841 --> 02:36:25.175
BUT THE CVS IS OF THE WORLD

02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:26.143
WOULD NOT DO IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO

02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:28.545
EXPENSIVE.

02:36:28.612 --> 02:36:29.480
THERE IS NO.

02:36:29.546 --> 02:36:30.814
NO HIGHER PRICE TO PAY FOR

CHILDREN.

02:36:36.353 --> 02:36:38.422
THAT'S WHY SB SIX SEVENTEEN WILL

02:36:38.489 --> 02:36:42.326
ULTIMATELY HURT OUR FAMILIES.

02:36:42.392 --> 02:36:43.293
THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS --

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:44.428
PAT WHALEN HERE ON BEHALF OF

02:36:44.495 --> 02:36:45.529
UNITED NURSES ASSOCIATION

02:36:45.596 --> 02:36:47.431
CALIFORNIA UNION HEALTH CARE

02:36:47.498 --> 02:36:49.366
PROFESSIONALS -- I JUST WANT TO

02:36:49.433 --> 02:36:50.834
FOCUS ON A LITTLE BIT OF THE

02:36:50.901 --> 02:36:52.736
PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION ASPECTS

02:36:52.803 --> 02:36:54.772
OF THIS BILL -- THE SENATOR

02:36:54.838 --> 02:36:56.073
MENTIONED -- THE COLLECTIVE

02:36:56.140 --> 02:36:57.574
BARGAINING COMPONENT BUT HERE'S

02:36:57.641 --> 02:36:59.743
HOW THAT WORKS IT ALLOWS THE

02:36:59.810 --> 02:37:02.713
PHARMACY TO ENTER INTO A CBA

02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:05.582
WITH SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:37:05.649 --> 02:37:06.416
PHARMACY TECHNICIANS.

02:37:06.483 --> 02:37:08.252
ABOUT CHANGING DRAMATICALLY THE

02:37:08.318 --> 02:37:10.454
WORKING CONDITIONS OF THE

02:37:10.521 --> 02:37:10.788
PHARMACISTS.

02:37:10.854 --> 02:37:11.722
WITHOUT ANY CONSULTATION OR

02:37:11.789 --> 02:37:13.123
INPUT FROM THE PHARMACISTS THEY

02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:14.391
DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CPA WITH

02:37:14.458 --> 02:37:15.893
THE PHARMACISTS AT ALL.

02:37:15.959 --> 02:37:16.827
AND THAT'S THAT'S A VERY

02:37:16.894 --> 02:37:18.262
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT IN THE AREA

02:37:18.328 --> 02:37:19.830
OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING --

02:37:19.897 --> 02:37:22.132
BECAUSE YOU INTERJECT A DYNAMIC

02:37:22.199 --> 02:37:23.901
WHERE THE PHARMACY EMPLOYER.

02:37:23.967 --> 02:37:25.536
IS ENTERING INTO A CPA WITH A

02:37:25.602 --> 02:37:28.839
THIRD PARTY -- IN WHICH THE

02:37:28.906 --> 02:37:30.207
PRINCIPALLY AFFECTED FOLKS IN

02:37:30.274 --> 02:37:31.542
THIS CASE THE PHARMACISTS HAVE

02:37:31.608 --> 02:37:34.111
NO INPUT -- AND IT'S IF THAT WAS

02:37:34.178 --> 02:37:35.746
ALL IT DID.

02:37:35.813 --> 02:37:37.848
THAT WOULD BE BAD ENOUGH -- BUT

02:37:37.915 --> 02:37:40.184
IN OUR VIEW IT'S EVEN WORSE

02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:41.785
BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING A A

02:37:41.852 --> 02:37:43.620
PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE AS A MISTER

02:37:43.687 --> 02:37:45.355
LILLY JUST EXPLAIN AND PUTTING

02:37:45.422 --> 02:37:47.357
IT INTO THE VAGARIES OF THE

02:37:47.424 --> 02:37:47.658
COLLECTIVE.

02:37:47.724 --> 02:37:49.927
BARGAINING -- SITUATION WITHOUT

02:37:49.993 --> 02:37:52.696
ANY INPUT FROM THE PHARMACIST

02:37:52.763 --> 02:37:53.931
WHO IS THE LICENSED PROFESSIONAL

02:37:53.997 --> 02:37:55.566
WHOSE LICENSES ON THE LINE AND

02:37:55.632 --> 02:37:58.001
WHO IS THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE.

02:37:58.068 --> 02:38:00.871
FOR PATIENT SAFETY SO FOR THAT

02:38:00.938 --> 02:38:04.141
REASON WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL.
